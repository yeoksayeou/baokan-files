Covering Up is Worse Than Exposure
——On Tito's Speech on June 15
Commentator of this newspaper

Tito delivered a speech in Labin on the 15th of this month. In addition to making a new round of slanders against the communist parties of various countries, this speech did not respond in any way to the serious criticisms made against Yugoslav revisionism. He remained completely silent on fundamental questions such as: What reason did the Yugoslav communists have to betray the peace declaration they participated in and put forward completely opposite views on the international situation in their program? What necessity did the Yugoslav communists have to uglify the socialist system and beautify the capitalist system in their program and congress, attack the Soviet Union, socialist countries, and communist parties of various countries, attack the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements, and defend and praise the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism? When socialist countries made various efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia (this effort actually continued until before the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav communists, for example, the Hungarian-Yugoslav talks were held in March 1958), why did the Yugoslav communists so impatiently repay kindness with ingratitude?

There is undoubtedly a reason, but it is difficult to say. Therefore, Tito had to find an explanation for the people of Yugoslavia: The reason why the communist parties of various countries oppose the program of the Yugoslav communists is not because their program is thoroughly revisionist and anti-Marxist-Leninist, but because of some long-organized conspiracy, because they refused to participate in the meeting of the twelve communist parties and refused to participate in the socialist camp, and ultimately, because they "oppose dividing the world into various camps"! In this way, all the principled disputes about their revisionist program seem to be swept away.

This is precisely the characteristic of the tactics of all opportunists.

However, Tito's method of shifting the argument is not successful. The principled dispute cannot be avoided, and covering up is worse than exposure. The Yugoslav communists refused to participate in the meeting of the twelve communist parties, and raising this explanation is by no means beneficial to Tito. By what right did Tito tear up the agreement he had reached at the Bucharest talks? Why didn't Tito mention a word about Comrade Khrushchev's question raised in Sofia? Tito regards their refusal to participate in the socialist camp as the main reason for the anti-revisionist struggle of the communist parties of various countries, which is of course nonsense. Not participating in the socialist camp does not mean that one must vigorously promote revisionism and vigorously attack socialist countries. But in any case, a country that calls itself a socialist country insists on refusing to stand on the same front with socialist countries, refuses to stand clearly on the anti-imperialist side, and insists on treating imperialist countries and socialist countries equally, maintaining the same distance and the same "cooperation," which is always a strange story. What excuses in the world can help them justify themselves?

"We oppose dividing the world into various camps."

"In the current tense international situation, pursuing a constructive peace policy together with other peace-loving countries that do not belong to any bloc is more beneficial than participating in this camp, which would intensify the already tense world situation."

"We believe that cooperative relations must be established with all countries, and we should not limit ourselves to two camps. Conflicts will occur between these two camps, and one day wars may break out because of them."

What a typical traitor's voice! Opposing dividing the world into various camps... Sounds so much like a renegade who abandoned the Communist Party and surrendered to the enemy "opposing dividing society into various classes"! Since there are a series of imperialist countries and a series of socialist countries coexisting in the world, there will inevitably be certain camps. Even nations striving for independence, such as in North Africa and the Near East, have formed unions of one kind or another on a certain basis. This historical necessity cannot be changed by Tito or anyone else's subjective wishes. It is true that imperialist countries cannot be completely consistent with each other. But this does not mean that all socialist countries fighting for the common interests and common ideals of the international proletariat cannot be closely united. The comradely unity of the socialist camp is impossible among any capitalist countries, and this is an important factor in the inevitable victory of socialism. The countries of the socialist camp have consistently insisted on dissolving all military blocs and consistently insisted on peaceful coexistence with all capitalist countries. But why must we dismantle our own unity in order to abolish military blocs and achieve coexistence? Isn't the truth the opposite? According to Tito's logic, the participation of socialist countries in the socialist camp will make the world situation more tense, and the non-participation of socialist countries in the socialist camp can make the world situation more relaxed. Then, the more countries that succeed in the socialist cause, the more inevitable war will become, and in order to completely relax the world situation and avoid war, all socialist countries should not participate in the socialist camp and abolish the socialist camp. However, before World War II, there was indeed no socialist camp, so why did Hitler's Germany launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union? Is this "because Stalin pursued a stubborn and unnecessarily threatening foreign policy" so that Hitler "could not achieve his goals through diplomatic means"? In April 1941, Yugoslavia did not even hang the signboard of socialism, didn't it also suffer Hitler's aggression? Tito completely disregards these basic facts and advocates that to have peace, one must avoid the unions opposed by imperialism. Here, Tito has not only a trace of communist flavor, but also a trace of anti-imperialist national revolutionary flavor.

Tito's propaganda that the unity of socialist countries will create a tense situation and the danger of war, in plain language, is nothing more than: Workers, oppressed people, revolutionaries, socialists, you must not divide the world into camps, you must not "limit" yourselves to camps. You should "establish cooperative relations" with all political forces (no matter what forces they are!), which will be of great benefit to you. According to the program of the Yugoslav communists, this is the Yugoslav-style "active coexistence policy," which is "a manifestation and a need for the rapid development of productive forces, which promotes the actual connection of the whole world and the close interdependence of various countries' economies. This policy embodies the objective needs of the contemporary world for extensive economic cooperation and comprehensive cultural, scientific and other cooperation. Therefore, the active coexistence policy creates the necessary prerequisites for the unification of the world situation. One of the goals of socialism should be the unification of the world economy." All this is so wonderful! And if you don't know the times and don't dissolve your unity, the situation will become tense, and most importantly, one day conflicts will occur (as long as the camps are preserved, this is inevitable!!!), you can forget about being able to stay out of it!

We do not intend to discuss the positions of various neutralists here. Many peaceful and neutral countries have not only not engaged in sabotage activities against socialist countries, but have also formed good relations with socialist countries. Therefore, in the struggle to maintain peace, resist aggression, and develop their national economies, they can completely rely on the friendship of socialist countries. The Tito elements are different from ordinary neutralists. They play a corrupting, disintegrating, and subversive role in the ranks of the international proletariat under the banner of Marxist-Leninists and socialist countries, which forces us to resolutely expose their true colors. Some people say, why drive Tito to the side of imperialism? But as the facts show, Tito insists on the revisionist pro-imperialist position not because someone is driving him. And it seems that in any case, he will not abandon the banner of neutrality or socialism, and will not simply stand on the side of imperialism, because he "knows how to do it" to maintain his bargaining position. Therefore, worrying that he will run to the West and relaxing the exposure of them is not good for the socialist cause, just as fearing to "stimulate" imperialism and not uniting the peace forces, not exposing the conspiracy of war-mongers, is not good for the cause of peace.

Let's go back to the issue of peace. We have always believed that peace must be resolutely defended and can be defended, but this goal can only be achieved on the condition that all peace forces unite to fight stubbornly against the conspiracy of war preparers. Here, the problem is not only to resolutely oppose war, but also to point out that the people do have the power to overcome the threat of war, and to call on the people to prepare to thoroughly eliminate all aggressors and completely eliminate the imperialist system that produces war when war maniacs insist on imposing war on the people. Without this determination, war cannot be stopped, and if the aggressors dare to launch a war, the people will be in a state of panic. And what path do Tito and the Tito elements point out to the people of various countries? They use the danger of war to frighten people and call on them to sweep the snow in front of their own doors, to disintegrate the union of all socialist forces, all anti-imperialist forces, and all anti-war forces, and to call on people to establish cooperation with U.S. imperialism and all imperialism, in order to achieve "the unification of the world" and... establish "socialism"! Any objective observer can easily see that the Tito elements' policy is not only impossible to defend world peace, impossible to assist the independence of Korea and Vietnam, but also impossible to assist the independence of Egypt, Syria, Indonesia, Algeria, and Lebanon.

In order to further reverse right and wrong, Tito even forcibly linked his own policy of surrender with the Soviet Union's peace policy, and even compared the United States' assistance to Yugoslavia with the United States' relief to the Soviet famine in 1921. What was the situation in 1921? Even under extremely difficult conditions at the time, the Soviet government still carried out a resolute struggle against the American relief agency headed by Hoover, which had obvious political purposes, and did not allow American relief activities to escape the supervision of the Soviet government. Lenin at the time described the viciousness of the imperialists using the Soviet famine to oppose the Soviet Union: "I don't know if the devil is more terrible than modern imperialism. But I know that in fact, it is." It is precisely because the Soviet Union treated imperialist countries with the attitude of the revolutionary proletariat, and never fantasized about relying on imperialist countries, that imperialism always regarded the Soviet Union as a thorn in its side, tried every means to oppose and sabotage the Soviet Union, and stubbornly rejected the Soviet Union's various proposals for easing the international situation. But how did Tito and his ilk treat American aid? Tito openly praised American wheat and gold yuan, and boasted that they "knew how" to rely on American aid indefinitely to "maintain independence" and "build socialism." And the U.S. imperialists also boasted that they "knew how" to sabotage the socialist cause by aiding Yugoslavia. Tito said: "The Americans give us aid not to let socialism triumph in Yugoslavia." The problem is not that simple. Eisenhower made it clear on the 18th of this month: He will give any kind of assistance to those countries in the Soviet bloc that contribute to weakening the unity of the Soviet bloc. So, have the Americans achieved their goal? We can see that whether it was in the 1956 Hungarian Nagy counter-revolutionary group's rebellion, in the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav communists and the program it passed, or in the so-called protests in Yugoslavia after the recent Hungarian sentencing of the Nagy counter-revolutionary group case, the Tito elements acted as the vanguard of the imperialist reactionaries in opposing the Soviet Union and communism. But Tito still insists that he has not opposed the Soviet Union, supported imperialism, and that his policy is the Soviet Union's policy. In Tito's own words, "this kind of behavior is simply shameless to the extreme!"

Tito's frantic attack on the Chinese Communist Party in his speech can only make us feel honored. The ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan said it well: "How can what is square be made round, how can those who follow different paths live in peace!" The struggle between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists is inevitable, and it is terrible to be praised by revisionists and even imperialists. The Chinese Communists' criticism of the Yugoslav revisionists has clearly hit their sore spot. They cannot use the history of Sino-Yugoslav relations to incite the people's nationalistic hatred, and therefore have to fabricate some particularly absurd—and therefore particularly inferior—lies to fight. Tito said that we criticize them because we are "uneasy about their peace-loving policy, peace policy, and coexistence policy," because we oppose easing world tensions, and therefore "are in the same position as the most reactionary war-mongers in the West." But anyone can ask a question: If it is us, not Tito, who are close to the war-mongers, why are the most reactionary war-mongers in the West, Dulles and his ilk, not at all "uneasy" about Tito's "peace-loving policy, peace policy, and coexistence policy," and even want to give him a lot of rewards? Tito also said that we oppose revisionism because we have difficulties internally, because we need some kind of loan. Really, three sentences cannot leave his trade! A dwarf kneeling in the mud desperately spits saliva at a giant standing on a high mountain, and however he spits, it can only fall on his own face. Tito's few words just drew a wonderful sketch of the face of the Tito elements.

Tito's painstakingly prepared speech is composed of such a batch of irrefutable lies. Tito said that we have not published "any of their materials," perhaps the most clumsy of these lies. We do not believe that socialist newspapers must publish the long speeches of revisionists, but the facts are the facts. In 1956, we published in full the infamous Pula speech by Tito and the parliamentary speech by Kardelj, just as we recently published the full text of the two drafts of the program of the Yugoslav communists, and now we have published the full text of his Labin speech; however, the Yugoslav newspapers have rarely published our articles in full. But Tito can still shamelessly say: "Obviously, in terms of morality, we are much superior to them"!

Tito boasts that the Yugoslav people are "united" with him, and spreads rumors to provoke the friendship between the Yugoslav people and the people of socialist countries. But Tito cannot explain why the Yugoslav state power organs, which have long been "disappearing," have recently arrested sincere communists on a large scale. Of course, when imperialism can still support a group of domestic and foreign labor aristocrats, these labor aristocrats can still be active within a considerable scope, and there will always be people who maintain hope for them. However, the setting sun of the West is falling, and is the future of the Tito elements and all revisionist elements facing the West bright?

    欲盖弥彰
    ——评铁托6月15日的演说
    本报评论员
    铁托在本月15日在拉宾发表了一篇演说。这篇演说除了对于各国共产党作了一番新的污蔑以外，对于它们针对南斯拉夫修正主义所进行的严肃的批判，什么也没有答复。他以完全的沉默来对待这些根本性质的问题，例如：南共究竟有什么理由背叛它所参加的和平宣言，在自己的纲领中对于国际形势提出完全相反的观点？南共究竟出于什么必要在自己的纲领中和代表大会上丑化社会主义制度而美化资本主义制度，攻击苏联、各社会主义国家和各国共产党，攻击德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨坦的协定，而对全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义却加以辩护和称颂？当社会主义各国作出种种努力改善同南斯拉夫的关系的时候（这种努力实际上一直进行到南共七大以前，例如匈南会谈就是1958年3月举行的），为什么南共要这样迫不及待地以怨报德？
    原因无疑是有的，但是很难说出口。因此，铁托只好在南斯拉夫人民面前设法找出一种解释：原来各国共产党之所以反对南共的纲领，并不是由于它的纲领是彻头彻尾地修正主义的，反马克思列宁主义的，而是由于某种早就组织好的阴谋，由于他们拒绝参加十二国共产党的会议和拒绝参加社会主义阵营，归根结蒂，由于他们“反对把世界分裂成各种阵营”！这样，关于他们的修正主义纲领的一切原则争论，好像就可以一笔勾消了。
    这正是一切机会主义者的战术的特点。
    不过铁托的这种转移论点的办法并不成功。原则的争论仍然逃避不了，而且掩耳盗铃，欲盖弥彰。南共拒绝参加十二国共产党的会议，提出这个解释来对于铁托决不有利。铁托凭什么撕毁他在布加勒斯特会谈中已经达成的协议呢？铁托对于赫鲁晓夫同志在索非亚提出的这个质问，为什么一个字也不提呢？铁托把他们拒绝参加社会主义阵营作为各国共产党进行反修正主义斗争的主要原因，这当然是信口开河。不参加社会主义阵营，并不等于一定要大事宣传修正主义，大事攻击社会主义各国。但是无论如何，一个自称为社会主义国家的国家，却硬要拒绝同社会主义国家站在一条战线上，拒绝明明白白地站在反帝国主义这一边，硬要对帝国主义国家和社会主义国家等量齐观，保持同等的距离和同样的“合作”，这总是一个奇谈。世界上究竟有什么借口能帮助他们自圆其说呢？
    “我们反对把世界分裂成各种阵营。”
    “在目前这种紧张的国际局势中，同其他同样不属于任何集团的爱好和平的国家一起奉行建设性的和平政策，比参加这个阵营从而使已经紧张的世界局势更为加剧要有益一些。”
    “我们认为，必须同一切国家建立合作的关系，而不应该把我们自己局限于两个阵营之中。这两个阵营之间将会发生冲突，并且有朝一日可能会因为它们而爆发战争。”
    多么典型的叛徒的声音！反对把世界分裂成为各种阵营……听起来多像一份脱离共产党而向敌人投降的自首分子“反对把社会分裂成各种阶级”的悔过书！世界上既然有一系列帝国主义国家和一系列社会主义国家同时存在，就不会没有一定的阵营存在。就是争取独立的民族，例如在北非和近东，也在一定的基础上形成了这样那样的联合。这个历史的必然性是不以铁托或其他任何人的主观愿望为转移的。诚然，帝国主义国家不可能彼此一致。但是这决不是说，一切为国际无产阶级的共同利益和共同理想而奋斗的社会主义国家，也可以不紧密地联合在一起。社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营在性质上根本相反，根本不能同日而语。社会主义国家的同志式的团结，是任何资本主义国家相互间所不可能有的，而这正是社会主义必然胜利的重要因素之一。社会主义阵营各国一贯地坚持解散一切军事集团，并且一贯地坚持同一切资本主义国家和平共处。但是为什么必须拆散自己的团结才能取消军事集团和实现共处呢？真理不正是相反吗？按照铁托的逻辑，社会主义国家而参加社会主义阵营就是使世界局势更为紧张，社会主义国家而不参加社会主义阵营就能使世界局势更为和缓，那么，社会主义事业在愈多的国家胜利，战争就愈不可避免，而为了彻底和缓世界局势和避免战争，当然应该使所有的社会主义国家都不参加社会主义阵营，取消社会主义阵营。可是，在第二次世界大战以前，确乎没有社会主义阵营，为什么希特勒德国也发动了对苏联的侵略战争呢？这难道是“由于斯大林执行顽固和不必要的威胁性外交政策”，以至希特勒“不可能靠外交途径达到自己的目的”吗？在1941年4月，南斯拉夫甚至连社会主义的牌子也没有挂，不是也遭到希特勒的侵略吗？铁托完全不顾这些基本的事实，主张要和平就得避开帝国主义所反对的联合。在这里，铁托不但没有一点共产主义者的气味，而且也没有一点反帝国主义的民族革命家的气味了。
    铁托宣传的这种社会主义国家团结起来就会造成紧张局势和战争危险的论点，换成通俗的语言，无非是：劳动者们、被压迫者们、革命者们、社会主义者们呀，你们万不可把世界分裂为阵营，万不可把自己“局限于”阵营呀。你们应该同一切政治力量（管它是什么力量！）去“建立合作的关系”，这样对你们大有好处呀。据南共纲领说，这就是南斯拉夫式的“积极共处政策”，它是“生产力飞速发展的一种表现和一种需要，这种发展促进全世界事实上的联系，和各国经济紧密的相互依赖。这种政策体现出当代世界对广泛的经济合作，全面的文化、科学等合作的客观需要。因此，积极共处政策为世界情况的统一创造了必要的前提。社会主义的目的之一应该是世界经济的统一。”这一切多么美妙！而如果你们不识时务，不解散你们的团结，局势就会紧张起来，而最最重要的是，有朝一日发生冲突（只要保存阵营，这就是不可避免的呀！！！），你们就休想能够置身事外！
    我们不打算在这里讨论各种中立主义者的立场。许多和平中立国家不但没有对社会主义国家进行破坏活动，而且同社会主义国家结成了良好的关系，因此，它们在维护和平、反抗侵略和发展本民族经济的斗争中，完全可以信赖社会主义国家的友谊。铁托分子跟一般的中立主义者不同，他们打着马克思列宁主义者和社会主义国家的旗号，混在国际无产阶级的队伍中间起着腐化、瓦解和颠覆的作用，这就迫使我们不得不坚决地揭露他们的真面目。有人说，何必把铁托赶到帝国主义那一边去呢？但是如事实所表明的，铁托之所以坚持修正主义的亲帝国主义的立场，并不是因为有人赶他。而且看来无论如何，他也不会放弃中立或者社会主义的旗号，不会干干脆脆地站在帝国主义方面，因为他“懂得怎样做”才能保持他的可以讨价还价的地位。因此，担心他跑到西方去而放松对他们揭露，对于社会主义事业是没有好处的，正如因为害怕“刺激”帝国主义而不把和平力量团结起来，不去揭露战争贩子的阴谋，对于和平事业是没有好处的一样。
    让我们再回到和平问题上来吧。我们从来认为，和平是必须坚决保卫而且是可以保卫的，但是只有在一切和平力量团结起来同战争准备者的阴谋作顽强斗争的条件下，这个目的才能达到。在这里，问题不仅是要坚决地反对战争，而且要指明人民确有力量战胜战争的威胁，要号召人民准备在战争狂人硬把战争强加在人民头上的时候，就用联合的力量彻底消灭一切侵略者，彻底消灭产生战争的帝国主义制度。没有这种决心就不能制止战争，万一侵略者竟敢发动战争就将使人民处于惊慌失措的境地。而铁托和铁托分子指给各国人民的是一条什么道路呢？他们用战争危险恐吓人们各人自扫门前雪，号召瓦解一切社会主义力量、一切反帝国主义力量和一切反战争力量的联合，号召人们同美帝国主义和一切帝国主义建立合作，借以实现“世界的统一”，和……建立“社会主义”！任何客观的观察者都不难看出，铁托分子的这种政策，不但不可能保卫世界和平，不可能援助朝鲜、越南的独立，而且也不可能援助埃及、叙利亚、印度尼西亚、阿尔及利亚和黎巴嫩的独立。
    铁托为了进一步颠倒是非，竟把自己的投降政策同苏联的和平政策硬扯在一起，甚至把美国对南斯拉夫的援助同美国在1921年对苏联饥荒的救济加以比拟。在1921年的情况是怎样的呢？苏联政府就在当时极端困难的条件下，仍然向美国的以胡佛为首的带着明显的政治目的的救济署进行了坚决的斗争，不让美国的救济活动脱离苏联政府的监督。列宁当时曾经这样描写帝国主义者利用苏联饥荒反苏的穷凶极恶：“我不知道恶魔是否比现代帝国主义可怕。但我知道，实际上正是如此。”正是由于苏联用革命无产阶级的态度来对待帝国主义国家，从来不幻想依赖帝国主义国家，所以帝国主义始终把苏联看作眼中钉，千方百计地反对和破坏苏联，并且死硬地拒绝苏联关于缓和国际形势的各项建议。但是铁托之流却是怎样对待美国的援助呢？铁托公开地讴歌美国的小麦和金元，并且以他们“懂得”无限期地依赖美国的援助来“维护独立”和“建立社会主义”而自傲。而美帝国主义者呢，也同样以他们“懂得”通过援助南斯拉夫来破坏社会主义事业而自傲。铁托说：“美国人给我们援助并不是为了让社会主义在南斯拉夫取得胜利。”问题没有这样简单呀。艾森豪威尔本月18日说得清清楚楚：他将给予那些对削弱苏联集团的团结有贡献的苏联集团国家以任何种类的援助。那么，美国人是不是达到了目的呢？我们可以看到，无论在1956年的匈牙利纳吉反革命集团的叛乱中，在南共七次大会和它所通过的纲领中，或者在最近匈牙利判决纳吉反革命集团案件以后南斯拉夫的所谓抗议中，铁托分子都充当了帝国主义反动派反苏反共的急先锋。但是铁托仍然硬说，他并没有反对过苏联，支持过帝国主义，而且它的政策也就是苏联的政策。用铁托自己的话说，“这种作法简直是无耻到极点了！”
    铁托在他的演说中疯狂地攻击中国共产党，这只能使我们感觉光荣。中国的古诗人屈原说得好：“何方圆之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安！”马克思列宁主义者同修正主义者的斗争是不可避免的，受到修正主义者以至帝国主义者的赞赏才是可怕的。中国共产党人对于南斯拉夫修正主义者的批判显然打到了他们的痛处，他们无法利用中南两国关系的历史煽起人民的民族主义仇恨，因而不得不造出一些特别荒谬——因此也特别低劣——的谎言来作战。铁托说我们批评他们是因为我们对他们的“爱好和平的政策、和平政策、共处政策感到不安”，是因为我们反对缓和世界紧张局势，因而“同西方最反动的战争贩子处于同样的地位”。但是任何人都可以提一个问题：如果同战争贩子靠拢的是我们而不是铁托，为什么西方最反动的战争贩子杜勒斯之流对于铁托的“爱好和平的政策、和平政策、共处政策”一点也没有“感到不安”，而且还要大给其赏钱呢？铁托又说，我们反对修正主义是因为我们内部有困难，是因为需要某种贷款。真是三句不离本行！跪倒在泥塘里的侏儒拼命向立在高山上的巨人吐唾沫，怎样吐也只能落到自己的脸上。铁托的这几句话，恰好替铁托分子的面貌作了一幅绝妙的素描。
    铁托的煞费苦心的演说，就是用这样的一批驳不胜驳的谎言组成的。铁托说我们没有发表他们的“任何材料”，也许是这些谎言中最笨拙的一个。我们并不认为社会主义的报纸一定要发表修正主义者的长篇大论，但是事实毕竟是事实。在1956年，我们全文发表了铁托的臭名昭著的普拉演说和卡德尔的议会演说，就如不久以前出版了南共纲领的两次草案全文，现在又发表了他的拉宾演说全文一样；而南斯拉夫报纸对于我们的文章却从来很少全文发表过。但是铁托仍然可以大言不惭：“显然在道义方面我们比他们优越得多”！
    铁托吹嘘南斯拉夫人民同他是“一致”的，并且多方造谣挑拨南斯拉夫人民同社会主义各国人民的友谊。但是铁托不能解释，为什么早已在“消亡”中的南斯拉夫国家强力机关，最近忽然大肆逮捕真诚的共产主义者。当然，在帝国主义还可以养活一批国内外的工人贵族的时候，这些工人贵族总还可以在相当的范围内活动，总还会有人对他们保持希望。但是，西方的斜阳正在下坠，面向着西方的铁托分子和一切修正主义分子的前途，难道是光明的吗？
