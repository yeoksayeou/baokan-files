Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th. Yichang Special District in Hubei Province is comprehensively launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign of "One Factory per Team, One Pile per Five Mu." The entire district plans to accumulate another one billion dan of fertilizer before the end of July to meet the needs of topdressing for autumn crops; from August, preparations will begin for winter sowing and next year's spring plowing production.

"One Factory per Team" means that each production team runs a native chemical fertilizer factory. This was first created by Wan Daochuan, a member of the Qunjian Cooperative and a Communist Party member in Yidu County. He is the son of a poor peasant, only studied for one year before liberation, and now has only a junior high school education. Not long ago, the Qunjian Cooperative found that only one-third of the cooperative's fertilizer accumulation plan had been completed during a production inspection, and the crops urgently needed topdressing, so everyone was very anxious. He studied hard for a month, and finally completed all the work from batching to decoction in four nights, and the method of making chemical fertilizer by native methods was thus successful. The raw materials used for this fertilizer include nitrate, firewood alkali, bone meal, *tiger flower兜子* water, lime, etc. The required equipment is only simple stoves and iron pots. According to Wan Daochuan's method, the Qunjian Cooperative used old stoves and other equipment, spent only twenty-eight yuan, and built a native chemical fertilizer factory in two days, producing 3,600 jin of fertilizer per day. Chemical analysis proved that the fertilizer produced is a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizer mainly containing phosphorus, and its fertilizer effect is equivalent to one dan of farm manure per jin. Because of the abundant raw materials, simple equipment, low cost, fast production, good fertilizer effect, and little labor, after the Yidu County Committee of the Communist Party of China promoted it, the native chemical fertilizer factory was welcomed by all townships and cooperatives, and quickly developed more than 1,000 in the county. The entire special district also quickly developed more than 3,000. Recently, the prefectural committee officially decided to further promote this experience of making chemical fertilizer by native methods, and put forward the slogan "One Factory per Team," requiring that this native chemical fertilizer factory be developed to 25,000 by the end of June, with a monthly output of 450 million jin.

"One Pile per Five Mu" means one fertilizer composting pile for every five mu of land. This is the successful experience of Changyang County in accumulating fertilizer. At present, there are 160,000 such fertilizer piles in the district. According to the requirement of "One Pile per Five Mu," the district plans to develop to one million by the end of June. According to existing experience, each fertilizer pile can produce 300 dan of fertilizer per month.

The Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that it is entirely possible to complete the task of accumulating another one billion dan of fertilizer before the end of July by carrying out the fertilizer accumulation campaign in the entire district using the above two methods, combined with regular household fertilizer accumulation. In this way, all the fertilizer needed for autumn crops in the district can be fully met. The native method of making chemical fertilizer requires very little labor, and composting in the field also saves labor. Therefore, despite vigorously carrying out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, more labor can still be used for field management and other agricultural work, so that fertilizer accumulation, field management, and other work can be advanced simultaneously. From this point of view, the fertilizer accumulation experience in Yichang area and the practice of preparing fertilizer early for winter sowing and next year's spring plowing production are worthy of promotion in various places.

This newspaper reports Guangxi Yulin County, after the victorious completion of late rice planting task in mid-May, immediately launched a fertilizer accumulation movement across the county. Under the slogan of a thousand *dan* of fertilizer for a thousand *jin* of grain, the masses were mobilized to invest in fertilizer accumulation activities. From the end of May to June 11, the county's accumulated fertilizer averaged 320,000 *jin* per *mu*.

The rapid progress of the fertilizer accumulation campaign is mainly due to the great encouragement of the General Line. In the early stage of the campaign, all localities studied the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, used the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical to measure the current campaign, broke superstitions, emancipated the mind, and pushed the already formed upsurge to a deeper and wider stage. Dongming Township, which was running at the forefront of the movement, initially planned to accumulate 500 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu*, but later it continued to break through and changed it to 3,000 *dan*. After learning the General Line, it re-arranged the sources of fertilizer and finally revised it to 4,000 *dan*.

With the thought of striving for the upstream established, the masses' horizons were greatly opened, and fertilizer sources were endless. The largest source of fertilizer is the implementation of "three collectives." A large number of old cattle pens, pigsties, and manure pits were dismantled, resulting in thousands and tens of thousands of *dan* at once. Everywhere in the county: nitrate bricks were piled up like mountains, and piles of fertile mud looked like ridges. The second is to block rivers and dams to dig fertile mud, large-scale mining of charcoal mud, large-scale composting of *dang* fertilizer, and collecting green grass to make green manure.

### 给秋庄稼准备充足的肥料  湖北宜昌专区推广“一队一厂，五亩一垱”积肥方法  广西玉林县积肥运动进展神速，每亩积肥已达32万斤

    给秋庄稼准备充足的肥料
    湖北宜昌专区推广“一队一厂，五亩一垱”积肥方法
    广西玉林县积肥运动进展神速，每亩积肥已达32万斤
    新华社武汉19日电　湖北省宜昌专区全面展开“一队一厂、五亩一垱”的积肥运动。全区准备在7月底前再积肥料十亿担，以满足秋季作物追肥的需要；从8月起将开始为冬播和明年春耕生产准备肥料。
    “一队一厂”，就是一个生产队办一个土化肥厂。这是宜都县群建社社员、共产党员万道传首创的。他是一个贫农的儿子，解放前只读过一年书，现在也只有高小文化水平。不久前，群建社在检查生产时发现全社积肥计划只完成三分之一，而庄稼又急需追肥，大家都很着急。他苦心研究了一个月，最后用四个夜晚的时间完成了从配料到熬煎的全部工作，土法制化肥的方法就这样成功了。这种肥料所用的原料，包括有硝盐、柴碱、骨头粉、老虎花兜子水、石灰等，所需设备只是简单的炉灶和铁锅。根据万道传的办法，群建社利用旧锅灶等设备，只用二十八元，两天建成一个土化肥厂，日产肥料三千六百斤。经化验证明，制成的肥料是一种含磷为主的氮磷钾混合肥料，它的肥效每斤相当于一担农家肥。由于原料丰富、设备简单、成本低、生产快、肥效好、费工少，经中共宜都县委推广后，土化肥厂受到各乡、社的欢迎，很快全县就发展了一千多个。全专区也很快就发展了三千多个。最近，地委正式决定进一步推广这种土法制化肥的经验，提出了“一队一厂”的口号，要求在6月底前把这种土化肥厂发展到二万五千个，月产四亿五千万斤。
    “五亩一垱”，即每五亩田一个沤肥垱，这是长阳县用来积肥的成功经验。目前全区已有这种肥垱十六万个，按“五亩一垱”的要求，全区计划在6月底前发展到一百万个。据已有经验，这种肥垱每垱每月可沤肥三百担。
    中共宜昌地委认为，用上述两种方法在全区范围内开展积肥运动，结合经常性的家庭积肥，在7月底前完成再积肥十亿担的任务是完全可以作到的。这样，全区秋季作物所需肥料就可以全部满足。土法制化肥所需人工很少，沤田头垱也能节省劳力，因此尽管大力开展积肥运动，仍然可以用更多的劳动力来从事田间管理等其他农活，从而能作到积肥、田间管理等工作齐头并进。从这个意义出发，宜昌地区的积肥经验和及早为冬播、明年春耕生产备肥的作法，都值得各地推广。
    本报讯　广西玉林县在5月中旬胜利完成了晚造播种任务后，立即在全县范围内开展了一个积肥运动。以千担肥料千斤粮的口号动员群众投入积肥行动，从5月下旬起到6月11日止，全县所积肥料平均每亩已达三十二万斤。
    积肥运动进展如此神速，主要是受到总路线的巨大鼓舞。在运动开展初期，各地都通过学习八大二次会议文件，以多、快、好、省的精神，来衡量当前运动，破除迷信，解放思想，把已经形成的高潮推向更深更广阶段。跑在运动前列的东明乡，最初只计划每亩积肥五百担，后来不断突破，又改为三千担，学习了总路线之后，重新摆了肥源，最后修改为四千担。
    树起了力争上游的思想，群众眼界大开，肥源无穷无尽。最大宗的肥源是实行“三集体”。拆掉了大批的旧牛栏、猪舍、粪坑，一下子就是几千几万担，全县到处是：硝砖积如山，肥泥堆似岭。其次是拦河塞圳挖肥泥，大规模开挖炭泥，大面积沤制氹肥，采青割草制绿肥等。
