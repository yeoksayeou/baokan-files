    Scared Himself
    U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy publicly clamored on June 19 that if the United States needed to intervene in Lebanon, he would use bombers carrying atomic bombs "without hesitation."
    McElroy originally wanted to use atomic bombs to scare the Lebanese people. However, the result was the opposite. The Lebanese people were not intimidated. They were in high spirits, preparing to resolutely resist the American and British interventionists. At the same time, news said that to maintain the security of the Middle East, the United Arab Republic would request the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting to discuss "the threat of the United States using atomic weapons in the Middle East." As a result, the atomic blackmailers panicked instead. On June 20, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman hurriedly came out to "categorically deny" that McElroy had ever said he would use atomic bombs. Hmph, if you had known this would happen, why did you do it in the first place!

    吓了自己
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在6月19日曾经公开叫嚷说：如果美国需要干涉黎巴嫩，他将“毫不犹疑地”使用携带原子弹的轰炸机。
    麦克耳罗伊本来是想用原子弹来吓唬黎巴嫩人民的。但是，结果适得其反。黎巴嫩人民并没有被吓倒，他们斗志昂扬，正准备坚决反抗美英干涉者。同时，有消息说，阿拉伯联合共和国为了维护中东的安全，将要求联合国安理会举行紧急会议来讨论“美国在中东使用原子武器的威胁”。这样一来，原子讹诈者反而慌张起来了。6月20日，美国国防部发言人赶忙出来“断然否认”麦克耳罗伊曾经说过要使用原子弹的话。哼，早知今日，何必当初呢！
