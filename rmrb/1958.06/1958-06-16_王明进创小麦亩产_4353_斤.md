Summer Harvest Triumphs Spread Everywhere, Each One Higher Than the Last
Wang Mingjin Creates Wheat Yield of 4353 Jin Per Mu
Red Light Surpasses Satellite, One Mu Yields 3650 Jin
Yongsheng Surpasses Red Light, Five Mu Yields 3664 Jin

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th – A 1.031 mu plot of wheat in the Xingguang Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, achieved an average yield of 4353 jin and 12.5 liang, surpassing the 3530 jin and 7.5 liang wheat yield created by the Satellite Cooperative in Suiping County, Henan Province, by 823 jin and 5 liang.

This astonishing record was created by Wang Mingjin, a 22-year-old Communist Youth League member and deputy leader of the production team, in his experimental plot. In addition to the acceptance team from the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the acceptance was attended by Li Xianjing, Deputy County Head of Gucheng County, Zhang Wenchang, Assistant Researcher at the Central China Agricultural Science Institute, Zhou Zhizhong, Head of the County Agricultural Technology Station, as well as township and cooperative cadres and many cooperative members. They carefully measured the plot, and personally threshed and weighed the harvest.

This plot is located near the Han River and was wasteland just five years ago. Last year, after the township Party branch called on everyone to plant high-yield experimental plots, Wang Mingjin planted wheat in this one-mu-plus plot, planning for a yield of 2000 jin per mu. At the time, no one believed him. Liu Jidou, an experienced old farmer, said to Wang Mingjin with disbelief, "Can you really harvest 2000 jin?" From then on, Wang Mingjin, determined to achieve high yields, stopped mentioning the plan and worked hard. He conscientiously studied and developed the experience of Lan Shijiang, a model worker in the township who achieved a thousand-jin wheat yield in 1956. He plowed this sandy loam soil four times with a double-shared plow, once straight and once across, to a depth of more than seven inches. Last autumn, the corn and beans in this plot were flooded, so he turned the corn and beans into base fertilizer. Because it was already very fertile, he did not apply fertilizer in layers, but simply applied 50 dan of cow manure as seed fertilizer when planting. He used a cross-strip planting method, with a four-inch wide sowing width and a two-inch-plus row spacing, and sowed 34 jin of Nanda 2419 improved seeds that had been treated with mud selection and Ceresan. Before and after the wheat jointing stage, he applied two top dressings of chemical fertilizer, the first with 10 jin of ammonium sulfate and the second with 12 jin of superphosphate, and weeded each time. As a result, the wheat in this plot grew exceptionally well.

According to the measurement of the acceptance personnel, this plot had more than 1.2 million wheat plants. The largest ears of wheat had more than 120 grains, and the average ear had 45 grains. Not only were there many grains, but the kernels were also full. After actual weighing, 11,000 grains weighed one jin, and the result was 4,488 jin and 12 liang of wheat.

After the news of Wang Mingjin's miracle of high wheat yield spread, Zhao Xiu, First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Shen Hanmin, First Secretary of the Gucheng County Committee, made a special trip to the Xingguang Cooperative to congratulate Wang Mingjin and the cooperative members. Wang Mingjin is now summarizing his experience in increasing production, further tapping potential, and striving to achieve a yield of 5000 jin per mu next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th – A 1.01 mu wheat field in the Seventh Production Team of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Linzhang County, Hebei Province, harvested a total of 3687 jin and 4 liang of wheat, creating a high-yield record of more than 3650 jin per mu, which is more than 120 jin higher than the "satellite" of the Satellite Cooperative in Suiping County, Henan Province. This high-yield field was cultivated by Yang Qingfeng, the leader of the Seventh Team, Sun Shenxiu, the deputy leader, and Sun Shenlian, the secretary of the village branch. When the harvest was reaped on the 13th, Liu Wenqing, Deputy Secretary of the Linzhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Tang Xuan, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department, and the Secretary of the Chengguan Town Committee, the Director, Deputy Director, and technical cadres of the Hongguang Cooperative were all present for acceptance. They measured the land, performed single harvesting and threshing, and weighed the harvest on the spot.

Last year, Yang Qingfeng cultivated a high-yield record of double thousand jin per mu on this 1.01 mu of land: each mu harvested 1095 jin of wheat in the wheat season, and the wheat-stubble millet yielded 1060 jin per mu. When wheat was sown last year, Yang Qingfeng and others were determined to create a wheat yield of 1500 jin per mu on this land. This plot was a high-yield field last year, and the soil was relatively fertile. 12,000 jin of base fertilizer and 50 jin of cake fertilizer were applied when the wheat was sown. The land was cultivated by means of a "sleeved ploughing" (套耕) method, deeply plowed to more than eight inches. The wheat seed was the "Pingyuan 50" improved variety, and the seeds were mixed with tin stone, with a total of 25 jin of seeds sown. The row spacing was one chi and two cun, and the sowing width was four cun. After the wheat seedlings emerged, they saw that the number of plants was small and the row spacing was too wide, so they added another row in the original row spacing, sowing 10 jin of seeds. In terms of wheat field management, they watered ten times before and after the New Year according to the soil quality and the growth of the wheat seedlings. 6,000 jin of coarse fertilizer was applied in the winter, 60 dan of night soil was irrigated, 30 jin of chemical fertilizer was applied during the greening stage, and 50 jin of cake fertilizer was top-dressed during the seedling raising and heading stages, and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer was also applied during the heading stage. They also prominently solved the problem of wheat lodging. 3,000 jin of potassium fertilizer was applied when the wheat seedlings were jointing, and phosphorus was sprayed once during flowering. After the Spring Festival, they mastered the watering of small amounts of water. Therefore, there was no lodging at all when the wheat was harvested. When the wheat matured, there were 1.1 million plants per mu, and the plants were about three chi high. Although the stalks were not very high, the ears were very large, with an average of 55 to 60 grains per ear.

The process of Yang Qingfeng and others creating high-yield fields has made them further realize that the potential of the land is infinite, and that in order to create high yields, it is necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking at all times. Originally, when Yang Qingfeng was working on this experimental field, he planned for a yield of 1500 jin per mu. When the cooperative carried out a competition with other cooperatives before the wheat harvest, the yield was estimated at 2000 jin. After the wheat matured, the yield was estimated at 2800 jin per mu when the cooperative estimated the yield. But now, the actual harvesting result is more than 3650 jin per mu. This vivid fact has greatly liberated their thinking. After threshing, they immediately formulated a summer planting plan, preparing to deeply plow this land, apply 30,000 jin of base fertilizer, plant "Er Ma Ya" corn, and intercrop sweet potatoes, ensuring a corn yield of 2000 jin per mu and a sweet potato yield of 6000 jin per mu (equivalent to 1500 jin of grain), for a total grain yield of 3500 jin. After harvesting the corn and sweet potatoes, they will plant wheat again, and next year they will require a wheat yield of 5000 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th – Five mu of wheat in the First Production Team of the Yongsheng Cooperative in Cuiying Township, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, averaged 3664 jin and 15 liang per mu after detailed acceptance by a joint acceptance team from the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee and the Guanghua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

According to the calculation results, there were an average of 1,100,595 ears per mu, with an average of 38 grains per ear. The main experiences of this five-mu wheat obtaining high yields are: (1) In cultivation, the principle of deep ploughing and fine cultivation was implemented, with three ploughings and three harrows, ploughing and harrowing at the same time, with a deep ploughing of more than six inches. (2) Uniform sowing, dense planting and timely early sowing, with 30 jin of seeds sown per mu, all of which were treated with Ceresan. Sowing was two days before the Cold Dew solar term. (3) Sufficient base fertilizer. (4) Strengthening field management work, weeding four times in general, twice before the New Year and twice after the New Year, ensuring vigorous growth of wheat seedlings.

    夏收捷报处处传　一处更比一处高
    王明进创小麦亩产4353斤
    红光赶过卫星，一亩亩产3650斤
    永胜胜过红光，五亩亩产3664斤
    新华社武汉15日电　湖北省谷城县星光社一点零三一亩小麦，平均亩产达到四千三百五十三斤又十二两五钱多，比河南省遂平县卫星社创造的小麦亩产三千五百三十斤又七两五钱还多八百二十三斤又五两。
    这个惊人的丰产纪录是二十二岁的共青团员、生产队副队长王明进在试验地里创造的。参加验收的除中共襄阳地委验收工作组外，还有谷城县副县长李宪靖，华中农业科学研究所助理研究员张文畅、县农业技术站站长周志忠，以及乡社干部和许多社员。他们仔细丈量了这块地，并且亲自打场、过秤。
    这块地紧靠汉水边，五年前还是一块荒地。去年乡党支部号召人人种高产试验地后，王明进便在这一亩多地里种了小麦，规划亩产二千斤。当时谁也不相信，种地很有经验的刘积斗老汉带着不信任的口吻向王明进说：“你能收两千斤？”从这以后，决心高产的王明进就不再提规划的事，埋头苦干起来。他认真学习和发展了本乡1956年创造小麦千斤高产的劳动模范蓝世江的经验，把这块油沙地用双铧犁直耕一遍，横耕一遍，前后耕了四次，耕深七寸以上。去年秋天，这块地的玉米、豆子都被水淹了，他把玉米、豆子翻作底肥，因为已经很肥了，再没分层施肥，只是随种下了五十担牛栏粪作为种肥。播种采用交叉条播的方法，四寸宽的播幅，两寸多宽的行距，下了三十四斤经过泥选和赛力散药剂拌过的南大二四一九良种。小麦拔节前后，又追施了两次化肥，第一次硫酸铵十斤，第二次过磷酸钙十二斤，并且每次还锄了草。因此，这块地的小麦长得特别好。
    经验收人员测算，这块地的小麦达到了一百二十多万株，最大的麦穗有一百二十多粒，平均每穗有四十五粒，不仅麦粒多，而且籽粒饱满，经过实秤，一万一千多粒就有一斤，结果打出麦子四千四百八十八斤十二两。
    王明进创造小麦高产奇迹的消息传出后，中共襄阳地委第一书记赵修，谷城县委第一书记沈汉民，都特地赶往星光社向王明进和社员们祝贺。现在王明进正在总结增产经验，进一步挖掘潜力，争取明年亩产达到五千斤。
    新华社天津15日电　河北省临漳县城关镇红光农业社第七生产队的一亩零一厘麦田，共收小麦三千六百八十七斤四两，创造了亩产三千六百五十斤以上的高额丰产纪录，比河南省遂平县卫星社的“卫星”还高一百二十斤多。这块丰产田是由第七队队长杨庆丰、副队长孙慎秀和村支部书记孙慎连培养的。13日收割打场时，中共临漳县委副书记刘文卿、农村工作部副部长唐暄和城关镇委书记、红光社主任、副主任、技术干部等都到场验收。他们丈量土地，进行单收单打，并到场上过了秤。
    去年杨庆丰曾在这一亩零一厘土地上培养了亩产双千斤的高额丰产纪录：麦季每亩收小麦一千零九十五斤，麦茬谷子亩产一千零六十斤。去年小麦播种时，杨庆丰等决心要在这一块地上创造亩产小麦一千五百斤的产量。这块地去年是丰产田，土质较肥沃，小麦播种时又施底肥一万二千斤、饼肥五十斤。土地采用套耕的方法，深耕到八寸多。麦种是平原五零良种，并用信石拌了种，共下种二十五斤。行距一尺二寸，播幅四寸。麦苗出土后，他们看到棵数较少，行距太宽，又在原来的行距中加播了一行，播了十斤种。在麦田管理方面，年前年后根据土质和麦苗生长情况浇了十次水。冬季追施粗肥六千斤，灌人粪尿六十担，发青时施化肥三十斤，提苗、孕穗时又各追饼肥五十斤，孕穗时并加施了化肥三十斤。还突出地解决了小麦不倒伏的问题，在麦苗拔节时追钾肥三千斤，扬花时喷磷一次，在春节后掌握了浇小水。所以到小麦收割时没有发生一点倒伏现象。小麦成熟时每亩合一百一十万株，株高三尺左右。秸秆虽然不很高，但是穗头很大，平均每穗五十五到六十粒。
    杨庆丰等创造高额丰产田的经过，使他们进一步认识到土地潜力无穷，要想创造高额产量必须时时刻刻克服右倾保守思想。原来杨庆丰在搞这块试验田时，计划亩产一千五百斤。收麦以前社与社开展评比时，评产为二千斤。小麦成熟后社内评产时又评为亩产二千八百斤。可是现在实打的结果，每亩却产三千六百五十斤以上。这一生动事实使他们的思想大大解放。打场以后，他们立即制订了夏种计划，准备把这块土地进行深翻，施底肥三万斤，种上二马牙玉米，间作甘薯，保证玉米亩产二千斤，甘薯亩产六千斤（折粮一千五百斤），共计产粮三千五百斤。收了玉米、甘薯以后，再种小麦，明年要求小麦亩产五千斤。
    新华社武汉15日电　湖北省光化县崔营乡永胜社第一生产队有五亩小麦，经过中共襄阳地委、光化县委联合验收组详细验收，平均亩产量达三千六百六十四斤又十五两。
    根据测算结果，平均每亩有一百一十万零五千九百五十穗，平均每穗三十八粒。这五亩小麦获得高产的主要经验是：（1）在耕作上贯彻了深耕细作，三犁三耙，随犁随耙，深耕六寸以上。（2）匀播密植和适时早播，每亩下种三十斤，全部经过赛力散药剂拌种，寒露前两天播种。（3）底肥充足。（4）加强田间管理工作，普遍锄了四次草，年前两次，年后两次，保证了麦苗生长旺盛。
