Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 26th: Under the situation of the simultaneous great leap forward in industry and agriculture, both industry and agriculture need more labor. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various factories and mines have adopted eight measures to ensure that the majority of the personnel needed for industrial expansion can be resolved within the cities, minimizing or eliminating the need to recruit workers from rural areas.

The eight measures are: First, to promote "one person, many skills" (meaning everyone learns multiple technologies and multiple businesses) and "one machine, many uses" (meaning certain mechanical equipment undertakes multiple operations). This was proposed by the Capital Construction Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant during the "Double-Anti" movement, based on the experiences of bricklayer Shen Xikai's team and excavator driver Yu Changbo. Shen Xikai's bricklaying team, because everyone could do four to five kinds of techniques, had a labor productivity 40% higher than other teams; excavator driver Yu Changbo used one machine to perform seven kinds of operations, increasing machine utilization by more than 58% compared to others. After these two methods were promoted in the Capital Construction Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, a work area of 3,700 people can complete the tasks of more than 5,000 people this year, equivalent to an increase of 36% in labor.

Second, to appropriately merge over-specialized labor organizations and reorganize them into comprehensive labor organizations. This reform has emerged in coal mines and capital construction departments. An engineering team building a mine in Yangquan Coal Mine, in a situation of labor shortage, reorganized the original three specialized engineering teams composed of tunneling, roof bolting, and masonry into one mixed engineering team, saving 30% of labor. This reform can save a large amount of labor, strengthen unified command, and overcome the phenomenon of mutual "buck-passing," fundamentally improving the relationship of collaboration between types of work.

Third, to improve tools and equipment through the technical innovation movement. The Beitongpu Railway construction site of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways mobilized the masses to create "indigenous machinery," and combined "indigenous machinery" with large-scale construction machinery and small-scale construction machinery, basically eliminating heavy manual labor and reducing the need for 12,000 temporary workers. Many technical innovations in the production departments have improved labor efficiency, which has relatively saved a large amount of labor.

Fourth, in seasonal production departments (such as construction enterprises and brick and tile factories, where the annual working time is only about eight months), appropriately adjust working hours during good production seasons. After the Taiyuan First Construction Company and the Municipal Engineering Company adopted this measure, they can use 14% fewer temporary workers this year.

Fifth, to consolidate labor discipline and improve attendance rates. For example, the Lingshi County Gypsum Factory eliminated absenteeism, tardiness, and early departures during the "Double-Anti" movement. Coupled with the reform of labor organization and the adjustment of technical forces, the labor productivity in March of this year increased by 50% compared to February. This year, the factory's output value can double without increasing personnel.

Sixth, to carry out labor force adjustment between enterprises to "make up for shortages with surpluses," especially transferring surplus employees from old enterprises to new enterprises that have begun production, which can reduce the number of apprentices recruited. Currently, 5,500 people have been adjusted throughout the province, and it is initially estimated that another 5,000 people can be adjusted.

Seventh, to transfer surplus staff from state organs and industrial and commercial enterprises to fill vacancies for permanent workers. After universally promoting worker participation in some management work, cadres participating in labor, and business reforms in enterprises throughout the province, another 10,000 staff members can be reduced to participate in physical labor. For odd-job personnel in state organs and industrial and commercial enterprises, adopting the method of "women replacing men" and "the old and weak replacing the young and strong" can transfer 2,000 people to become apprentices.

Eighth, in cities and industrial and mining areas with more than 20,000 people in the province, absorb unemployed youth as contract apprentices. According to preliminary estimates, 25,000 people can be absorbed throughout the province. In secondary and higher schools, implement the policy of work-study programs, organizing students to participate in industrial labor in a planned way, which can replace some temporary workers. For the labor force in the cities, after registration and education, a temporary labor reserve team can also be organized to serve industrial construction. Organizing some employees' family members to undertake some household labor (such as nurseries, canteens, sewing and washing clothes, etc.) in the form of cooperation can open up new production avenues for the vast number of women. This can both put the use of the urban labor force on a planned and organized track, and transform the city into a city where everyone participates in productive labor.

    山西各城市采取八项措施
    就地解决劳动力不足问题
    据新华社太原26日电　在工农业同时大跃进的形势下，工农业都需要更多的劳动力。中共山西省委和各厂矿企业采取八项措施，使工业需要增加的人员，绝大部分能够在城市解决，可以尽量不从或少从农村招收工人。
    这八项措施，第一是提倡“一人多艺”（即人人都学会多种技术和多种业务），“一机多用”（即某些机械设备担负多种作业）。这是太原钢铁厂基本建设部门在“双反”运动中，根据沈锡凯瓦工队和挖土机司机于长波的经验提出来的。沈锡凯瓦工队由于人人都能干四至五种技术，劳动生产率比别的队高40％；挖土机司机于长波用一台机器进行七种作业，机器利用率比别人提高58％以上。这两个办法在太原钢铁厂基建部门推广后，在一个三千七百人的工区，今年可以完成五千多人的任务，等于增加了36％的劳动力。
    第二是把过分专业化的劳动组织作适当合并，改组成为综合性的劳动组织。这种改革，在煤矿和基本建设部门都出现了。阳泉煤矿建设矿井的一个工程队，在劳力不足的情况下，把原来按掘进、打顶和砌?组成的三个专业工程队，改组成为一个混合工程队后，可以节约30％的劳力。这种改革既能节约大批的劳动力，又加强了统一指挥，克服了互相“扯皮”的现象，从根本上改善了工种之间的协作关系。
    第三是通过技术革新运动，改进工具和设备。铁道部第三工程局北同蒲线工地，发动群众创造“土机械”，并且把“土机械”和大型施工机械、小型施工机械结合起来，基本上消灭了笨重的体力劳动，能够少用临时工一万二千人。生产部门的许多技术革新，都提高劳动效率，这就相对地节约了大量劳动力。
    第四是在季节性的生产部门（例如建筑企业和砖瓦厂，全年工作时间只有八个月左右），在良好的生产季节适当地调整工作时间。太原第一建筑公司和市政工程公司采取了这项措施后，今年可以少用14％的临时工人。
    第五是巩固劳动纪律，提高出勤率。例如灵石县石膏厂在“双反”运动中，消灭了缺勤旷工和迟到早退的现象，加之对劳动组织的改革和技术力量的调整，今年3月份的劳动生产率比2月份提高50％。今年这个厂在不增加人的条件下，产值可以增长一倍。
    第六是在企业之间进行“以余补缺”的劳力调剂工作，特别是把老企业多余的职工调剂给新投入生产的企业，就可以减少学徒的招收数量。目前全省已经调剂了五千五百人，初步估计，还能再调剂五千人。
    第七是从国家机关和工商企业多余的工作人员中，抽调补充固定工人的缺额。在全省企业中，普遍推行工人参加部分管理工作、干部参加劳动和进行业务改革之后，还可以减少一万名工作人员去参加体力劳动。对国家机关和工商企业中的勤杂人员，采取“以女代男”和“以老弱代青壮”的办法，可以抽调二千人充当学徒工。
    第八是在全省二万人口以上的城市和工矿区，吸收尚未就业的青年充当合同徒工，据初步估计，全省可以吸收二万五千人在中等以上的学校中，实行勤工俭学，半工半读的方针，有计划地组织学生参加工业劳动，可以代替一部分临时工。对市民中的劳动力，经过登记和教育，也可以组织一支为工业建设服务的临时工预备队。用合作化的形式组织一部分职工家属担负一部分家务劳动（例如托儿所、食堂、缝洗衣服等劳动），就能为广大妇女开辟新的生产门路。这样既可以使城市劳动力的使用走上有计划、有组织的轨道，也可以把城市改造成为人人参加生产劳动的城市。
