Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th – Large-scale construction is underway on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, a major transportation artery connecting Sichuan and Guizhou. Currently, excavation of earth and stone for roadbeds is 60% complete along the entire line. Forty tunnels, over ten large and medium-sized bridges, and more than fifty culvert projects are also under intense construction. The entire bridge piers of the challenging Wujiang River Bridge have been completed. The Lou Shan Pass tunnel can also be fully opened soon.

The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway starts in Chongqing, Sichuan, passes through the Liangfengya and Lou Shan mountain peaks, which are over 1,300 meters and 1,600 meters high respectively, and then crosses the turbulent Wujiang River before reaching Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. This railway is one of the main lines of the future Southwest railway network. Its northern end is connected to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and its southern end will be connected to the under-construction Guizhou-Guangxi Railway and the soon-to-be-constructed Yunnan-Guizhou and Hunan-Guizhou Railways.

The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway project is very challenging. Seventy tunnels, with a total length of 27 kilometers, need to be built along the entire line. Currently, the longest tunnel in China, the Liangfengya tunnel, which is more than 4,270 meters long, is on this line. More than sixty bridges and culverts, as well as over six hundred and fifty culverts, need to be built. According to exploration, even in areas where the line usually passes through, it is necessary to contend with many karst caves, landslides, and algal surface areas.

    川黔铁路大规模施工
    新华社贵阳24日电　贯通四川和贵州之间的交通大动脉——川黔铁路，正在大规模施工。目前，全线正在开挖的路基土石方工程达60％；有四十座隧道、十多座大中桥梁和五十多个涵管工程，也正在紧张建设。工程艰巨的乌江大桥全部桥墩已经砌好。娄山关隧道在最近也可以全部打通。
    川黔铁路北起四川重庆，穿过高达一千三百多公尺和一千六百多公尺的凉风垭和娄山山峰，然后跨过水流湍急的乌江天险，抵达贵州省的省会贵阳。这条铁路是未来西南铁路网的主要干线之一。它的北端和成渝铁路相连，南端将和正在修建的黔桂铁路和即将修建的滇黔、湘黔铁路衔接。
    川黔铁路工程十分艰巨。全线要修建的隧道有七十座，共长二十七公里。目前我国最长的隧道——长达四千二百七十多公尺的凉风垭隧道，就在这条线路上。要建筑的桥涵有六十多座，还有六百五十多个涵渠。就是一般线路通过的地方，据勘探证明，都要和许多溶洞、滑坡和藻面地带作斗争。
