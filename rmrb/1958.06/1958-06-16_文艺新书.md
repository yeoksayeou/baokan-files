　　"Night Crossing of Erhai Lake"

　　This is a collection of short stories with the life of various ethnic groups in the border area of Yunnan as the subject matter, containing eleven works. In these works, the author depicts the struggles and today's happy life of the Dai, Bai, Jingpo, and Lisu people. The works have a strong national flavor and border life atmosphere, giving people a simple and kind feeling. Among them, "Night Crossing of Erhai Lake" tells a touching story of a strong Bai female communist party member who covered a group of underground workers to cross Erhai Lake at night on the eve of liberation; "Old Friend in the Wind and Rain" describes the story of a kind-hearted Dai Buddhist who sacrificed his relatives for righteousness in the struggle against the enemy; "Bride Snatching," "New Dai Daughter-in-Law," and other articles reflect the process of the gradual disintegration of old customs and old ideas under the impact of the waves of new life with a light and lively tone.

　　"Selected Songs of Béranger"

　　Béranger was a people's singer and revolutionary poet of the French Restoration period in the first half of the nineteenth century; many of his songs became bullets of the July Revolution of 1830. Marx once called him "the immortal poet of France." At that time, the reactionary French government imprisoned him under the pretext of blaspheming religion; but he did not succumb and still wrote many masterpieces in prison. This collection selects eighty-six representative songs from the author's works. They are not only sufficient to reflect the face of French society at that time, but also to show the author's fighting spirit. (Published by People's Literature Publishing House) (Jing)

The content includes various artistic creations from China and abroad, ancient and modern, with Chinese art and modern art as the main focus.

    “洱海夜渡”
    这是一本以祖国云南边疆各兄弟民族生活为题材的短篇小说集，共有十一篇作品。在这些作品中，作者描绘了傣、白、景颇、傈僳等族人民的斗争事迹和今天的幸福生活。作品有着浓厚的民族色彩和边疆生活气息，给人以朴实和亲切的感觉。其中“洱海夜渡”写了一个坚强的白族女共产党员解放前夕掩护一批地下工作者夜渡洱海的感人故事；“风雨故人”描述了一个善良的傣族佛教徒在对敌斗争中大义灭亲的事迹；“抢婚”、“傣族新媳妇”等篇，则以轻快的笔调反映了旧习俗、旧观念在新生活巨浪的冲击下逐渐解体的过程。　（作）
    “贝朗瑞歌曲选”
    贝朗瑞是十九世纪前半叶法国的人民歌手，王政复辟时期的革命诗人；他所作的许多歌曲成了1830年七月革命的子弹。马克思曾称他为“法国不朽的诗人”。当时法国反动政府曾借口说他侮蔑宗教，把他关进监狱；但他并没有屈服，在狱中仍然写了不少杰作。这本集子从作者的作品中选择了有代表性的歌曲八十六首。它们不仅足以反映当时法国社会的面貌，而且也能显示出作者的战斗精神。（人民文学出版社出版）　（靖）
