The Great Achievements of the Rectification Movement in the People's Liberation Army
The Tradition of Unity Between Officers and Soldiers is Further Enhanced

(By this newspaper) In the flames of the rectification movement over the past year, leading cadres and leading organs at all levels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have cultivated a fully revolutionized and mass-oriented working style, thereby making the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between officers and soldiers closer.

Senior Officers Dismount to Plant Flowers – Advanced Experiences Blossom Everywhere

The transformation of leadership style is prominently manifested in the fact that cadres at all levels going deep into the companies to "seek treasures" has become a common practice, and the phenomenon of "three empties" (empty leading organs, empty officer canteens, empty officer dormitories) has become widespread in the troops. Since this spring, the majority of personnel from the general headquarters and various services and arms of the PLA stationed in Beijing have gone deep into the boiling practical work under the leadership of their chiefs. The higher the responsible cadres, the greater the proportion of people going to the troops, and the longer the time spent. Many leading cadres and departments have moved their offices to the grassroots units. In the past, when the office cadres went down to the troops to check work, they only stood aside to point fingers and criticize. Now, from generals to lieutenants, they work together with the soldiers, feeling, crawling, rolling, grappling, drilling, maneuvering, and performing. The leadership method of chiefs taking the lead in personally planting "experimental fields" has been widely promoted in the troops. In the Beijing troops alone, there are more than 500 "experimental units." The military, division, and regimental three-level organs of a certain army have a total of 648 people going deep into the company to carry out various experimental works. Once advanced experience is discovered, the leading organs immediately hold "combat meetings" on the spot, organize relevant units to visit and study, and make advanced experience blossom rapidly in all directions. The working method of the director of the political department of a certain army leading 18 office cadres to form a "mobile political department" to summarize and promote advanced experience on the spot has been imitated by more and more leading organs.

Officers and Soldiers Share Weal and Woe – Glorious Traditions are Promoted

With the great transformation of the leadership style and the deep descent of office cadres, the relationship between officers and soldiers, which had been somewhat estranged since the regularization and modernization of the troops, has also undergone new changes. Because many officers and soldiers eat, live, work, drill, and entertain together, the revolutionary tradition of "unity between officers and soldiers" in the People's Army has been carried forward in the new historical period. Leaders at all levels share joys and hardships with soldiers, regarding the broad masses of soldiers as class brothers who are completely equal to themselves. When they go to work in the troops, some work together with the soldiers on construction sites, some stand guard for the soldiers, some help the cooks stir-fry dishes and cook meals and clean the canteen, some sew and mend clothes for the soldiers, and some teach the soldiers to sing and dance. During field exercises, this precious spirit of class friendship is even more visible everywhere. Many cadres at the division and regiment level and below march long distances with the soldiers and carry guns and backpacks for the soldiers. When they arrive at the campsite, the soldiers do not enter the room, and the cadres do not rest. Some cadres even give their beds to the soldiers to sleep in and sleep on the ground themselves. After the soldiers rest, the cadres persevere in checking the beds and sentry posts in extreme fatigue, and some automatically stand guard for the soldiers. The soldiers highly praised the "old Eighth Route Army style" of the cadres, which is "bearing hardships before enjoying comforts, caring for others, and forgetting oneself."

Mutual Promotion Between Officers and Soldiers – Great Leap Forward in Troop Training

After the vigorous rectification movement, the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of officers and soldiers excited the leading cadres, and the transformation of the leadership style further encouraged the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. This mutually promoting relationship is vividly reflected in the current great leap forward in various tasks centered on training in the troops. The soldiers' bold words are: "We must train in wind and rain, work at night with lights on, everywhere is a training ground, study hard and practice hard, watch heroes in the competition, and watch good men in the leap forward." The slogan "Creating All-Round Gunners," which has now become the goal of struggle for all army gunners, was the call issued by the artillery leading organ of the Beijing troops to all artillery units of the army after studying the experience of the Eighth Company of a certain artillery regiment. Under this great spirit of exerting full energy from top to bottom and striving for the top, this year's military training is far more numerous, faster, better, and more economical than in previous years. In the live ammunition shooting of various weapons, many all-"excellent" full-red classes, full-red platoons, and full-red companies have emerged, and the original annual training tasks will be completed several months ahead of schedule.

### 人民解放军整风运动的巨大收获  官兵一致的传统更加发扬光大

    人民解放军整风运动的巨大收获
    官兵一致的传统更加发扬光大
    本报讯  在一年来整风运动的烈火中，中国人民解放军各级领导干部和领导机关锻炼出充分革命化和群众化的工作作风，从而使上下级之间和官兵之间的关系更加密切起来。
    高级军官下马种花  先进经验四面开花
    领导作风的转变，突出地表现在各级干部深入连队“取宝”成为风气，部队中普遍出现了“三空”（领导机关空、军官食堂空、军官宿舍空）现象。自今春以来，驻北京的解放军各总部和各军种、兵种领导机关的大部分人员，分别在首长率领下深入到沸腾的实际工作中去了，越是负责干部下部队的人数比例越大，时间也越长。许多领导干部和机关部门把办公室搬到了基层单位，过去机关干部下部队检查工作只是站在一边指手划脚批评指责，现在从将军到尉官同战士一起摸、爬、滚、打、抓、钻、操、演。首长挂帅亲自种“试验田”的领导方法已在各部队中普遍推行，单是北京部队就有五百多个“试验单位”，某军的军、师、团三级机关共有六百四十八人深入连队进行各种试验工作。一发现先进经验，领导机关便在现场召开“作战会议”，组织有关单位参观学习，使先进经验迅速四面开花。某军政治部主任率领十八名机关干部组成“流动政治部”就地总结和推广先进经验的工作方法，已被越来越多的领导机关仿行。
    军官士兵同苦共乐  光荣传统发扬光大
    随着领导作风的大转变和机关干部的深入下层，自从部队进行正规化现代化建设以来一度有些疏远的官兵关系也发生了新的变化，由于许多军官和战士同吃、同住、同劳动、同操课、同娱乐，人民军队“官兵一致”的革命传统又在新的历史时期中发扬光大。各级首长和士兵们同甘共苦，把广大士兵看作同他们自己完全平等的阶级兄弟。他们下部队工作时，有的在工地上和士兵们一起劳动，有的代士兵站岗值勤，有的帮炊事员炒菜作饭、打扫食堂，有的给士兵缝补衣服，有的教士兵唱歌、跳舞……。在野营演习中，这种珍贵的阶级友爱精神更是到处可见：许多师、团级以下干部和战士们一起长途徒步行军，还替战士扛枪、扛背包；到了宿营地士兵不进房，干部不休息，有些干部还把炕让给士兵睡，自己睡地下；士兵们休息以后，干部们在极度疲劳中坚持查铺、查哨，有的自动替战士站岗。战士们十分赞扬干部们这种“吃苦在前，享受在后，关心别人，忘了自己”的“老八路作风”。
    官兵之间互相促进  部队训练大大跃进
    经过轰轰烈烈的整风运动，广大官兵的革命干劲激动了领导干部，领导干部作风的转变又进一步鼓舞了广大官兵的革命干劲：这种互相促进的相互关系生动地体现在各部队当前以训练为中心的各项工作大跃进中。士兵们的豪语是：“风雨也要练，晚上点灯干，处处皆操场，苦学加苦练，在竞赛中看英雄，在跃进中看好汉。”现在已成为全军炮手们奋斗目标的“创造全能炮手”的口号，是北京部队炮兵领导机关研究了某炮兵团八连的经验以后，向全军各炮兵部队发出号召的。在这种从上到下鼓足干劲、力争上游的伟大气魄之下：今年的军事训练远比往年多、快、好、省，在各种武器的实弹射击中，涌现了许多全部打“优秀”的满堂红班、满堂红排和满堂红连，而且将提前几个月完成原定的年度训练任务。（附图片）
