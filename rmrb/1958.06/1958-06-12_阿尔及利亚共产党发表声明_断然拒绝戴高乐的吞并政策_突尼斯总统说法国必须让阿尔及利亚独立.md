Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: According to TASS, Paris, June 10th: The leading body of the Algerian Communist Party published a statement in the newspaper on the 10th, stating that it "resolutely rejects the policy of merging Algeria with France announced by the head of the French government, De Gaulle, in Algeria on June 4th."

The statement pointed out, "De Gaulle deliberately ignores the profound national character of our struggle because: on the one hand, they are trying to keep Algeria under colonial oppression, as demanded by some committees established by the extreme right in Algeria; on the other hand, the French imperialist bourgeoisie still harbors racist contempt for our people."

The leading body of the Algerian Communist Party once again emphasized that "the only just and in line with the spirit of the times solution is to hold negotiations with the Algerian National Liberation Front in order to cease fire on the basis of recognizing Algeria's right to independence. In this case, conditions can be created to peacefully and smoothly resolve the common problems that history has presented to Algeria and France, and to establish new free and equal relations between the two countries."

On the same day, Rabah Bouhalfa, secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, issued a statement on France's policy towards Algeria, saying that the Algerian people have been fighting for nearly four years, making significant sacrifices, and they resolutely oppose the restoration of the colonial system in any form, striving to achieve the fundamental goal of national independence.

Bouhalfa emphasized that "Algerians are not shedding blood and sacrificing themselves in exchange for foreign citizenship. They are fighting to force others to recognize and respect their only citizenship—Algerian citizenship." He said that Algerians are not taking an anti-French stance, but a resolute anti-colonialist stance.

Referring to De Gaulle's remarks in Algeria, Bouhalfa said that De Gaulle's remarks against the Algerian people are also against the fraternal people of Tunisia and Morocco.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: According to TASS, Paris, June 10th: Tunisian President Bourguiba said that French Prime Minister De Gaulle's remarks in Algeria may lead to an escalation of the Algerian war.

Bourguiba told reporters from the American Broadcasting Corporation that De Gaulle's talk of "integration" "will not bring peace to Algeria, nor can it stop the struggle of the Algerian people." Bourguiba pointed out that the so-called "equality" of Algerians is "impossible to achieve."

Bourguiba said, "Algerians are not asking to be treated the same as the French, nor are they asking to be given the same rights and obligations as the French, but are asking for the return of the country and land to them, so that they can be free and independent."

Bourguiba said that the result of Algerian independence should be "the union of North Africa." He also said that in order to achieve unity and form a freely combined federation, all three nations (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco) must be free and independent. Bourguiba then said that for this reason, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria should all fight for the independence of Algeria.

    阿尔及利亚共产党发表声明
    断然拒绝戴高乐的吞并政策
    突尼斯总统说法国必须让阿尔及利亚独立
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社巴黎10日讯：阿尔及利亚共产党领导机关10日在报纸上发表了一项声明，声明“断然拒绝法国政府首脑戴高乐6月4日在阿尔及利亚所宣布的使阿尔及利亚同法国合为一体的政策”。
    声明指出，“戴高乐故意无视我们斗争所具有的深刻的民族性质，这是因为：一方面他们竭力想让阿尔及利亚继续处在殖民主义压迫之下，正如那些极右分子在阿尔及利亚所成立的一些委员会所要求的那样；另一方面法国帝国主义资产阶级人士对于我国人民仍然抱着种族主义的轻视态度。”
    阿尔及利亚共产党领导机关再一次强调说，“唯一公正和符合时代精神的解决办法是同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线举行谈判，以便在承认阿尔及利亚独立权利的基础上停火。在这种情况下，就可以创造条件来和平地顺利地解决历史向阿尔及利亚和法国提出的共同问题，并建立起两国之间的新的自由平等关系。”
    阿尔及利亚共产党书记拉比·布哈利在同一天就法国对阿尔及利亚的政策发表声明说，阿尔及利亚人民斗争了将近四年，作出了重大的牺牲，他们坚决反对以任何形式使殖民主义制度复辟，竭力为实现民族独立这一基本目标而奋斗。
    布哈利强调说，“阿尔及利亚人流血牺牲不是为了换取外国国籍。他们斗争是为了迫使别人承认和尊重他们唯一的国籍——阿尔及利亚国籍。”他说，阿尔及利亚人并不是采取反法国的立场，而是采取坚决反对殖民主义的立场。
    布哈利在谈到戴高乐在阿尔及利亚的言论时说，戴高乐反对阿尔及利亚人民的言论同时也是反对突尼斯和摩洛哥的兄弟人民的。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社巴黎10日讯：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴说，法国总理戴高乐在阿尔及利亚的言论可能导致阿尔及利亚战争加剧。
    布尔吉巴对美国广播公司的记者说，戴高乐所说的“合为一体”，“不会给阿尔及利亚带来和平，也不能停止阿尔及利亚人民的斗争”。布尔吉巴指出，所谓阿尔及利亚人的“平等”是“不能实现的”。
    布尔吉巴说，“阿尔及利亚人并不要求对待他们同法国人一视同仁，也不是要求给他们以同法国人一样的权利和义务，而是要求把国家和土地还给他们，使他们能够自由独立。”
    布尔吉巴说，阿尔及利亚独立的结果应当是“北非的联合”。他又说，为了取得联合和组成自由结合的联邦，必须三个民族（阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥）都是自由和独立的。布尔吉巴接着说，正因为如此，突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚都应当为阿尔及利亚的独立而斗争。
