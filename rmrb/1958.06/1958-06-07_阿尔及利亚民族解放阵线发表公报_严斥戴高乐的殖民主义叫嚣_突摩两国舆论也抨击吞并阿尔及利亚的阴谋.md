(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The Liaison and Executive Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front issued a communiqué in Cairo on the evening of the 5th, condemning De Gaulle's speech in Algiers on the 4th as a continuation of French colonialist policy. The communiqué pointed out that De Gaulle is merely continuing the policies of previous French governments. His policies have closed the door to any possibility of a negotiated solution based on Algerian independence.

The communiqué pointed out that De Gaulle's speech ignored the United Nations' recommendations and was a challenge to the international public opinion expressed at the Bandung, Cairo, and Accra conferences in support of Algeria's freedom and independence. The communiqué said that since De Gaulle refused a peaceful solution to the Algerian conflict, he should bear full responsibility for the continuation of the war and the war's possible extension to the entire North African region.

According to news from New York: Yazid, a spokesman for the Algerian National Liberation Front, issued a statement at the United Nations on the 5th regarding De Gaulle's speech on the Algerian issue, stating that he would request the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Algerian issue.

The statement said: General De Gaulle's statement clearly shows that he is deliberately ignoring the fundamental issue in Algeria, which is the struggle of the entire people for independence, a struggle they must achieve.

De Gaulle's speech also aroused unanimous criticism in the capitals of Tunisia and Morocco. An editorial in "Al Amal," the organ of the ruling Tunisian Neo Destour party, emphasized that there is no doubt that the Algerian people's four years of heroic warfare were certainly not for De Gaulle to come and express his "concern" to them, nor were they for complete "incorporation" into the French Republic.

Another newspaper in the Tunisian capital, "Le Matin," believes that De Gaulle's speech is another declaration of war against the Algerian people.

Reports say that people in the Tunisian capital also believe that De Gaulle's remarks will add difficulties to the relations between France and North Africa.

A dispatch from Rabat by United Press International on the 4th quoted a senior Moroccan official as saying that De Gaulle's speech was "a major disaster." He said that "all the nice things De Gaulle said" in his letter to the King of Morocco "vanished in a few minutes."

An editorial in "Al Alam," the organ of the Moroccan ruling Istiqlal Party, emphasized that Algerian independence is a condition for resolving some fundamental issues between Morocco and France.

The Parisian newspaper "L'Humanité" published an editorial on the 5th saying that De Gaulle's speech in Algiers did not mention the real and only issue of major significance to the Algerians, but instead promised "to treat them like the French." The editorial said, however, that they have already taken up arms to fight for the right to be called Algerians.

The editorial said that De Gaulle spoke in the language of the extreme right-wingers, with their applause. This may cause serious consequences not only in Algeria but also in the entire North Africa.

According to news from Algiers: De Gaulle continued to deliver his Algerian policy speeches in the Algerian cities of Constantine and Bone on the 5th. He continued to explain that his policy is to turn Algerians into French; he intends to have ten million Algerian residents participate in a "civic referendum" on amending the constitution together with residents in other parts of France in three months, and then hold elections in Algeria to elect "representatives of the French public authorities."

De Gaulle also indicated in his remarks on the 5th that he himself will serve as the Minister Delegate for Algeria in the French Cabinet, and the current French Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, Salan, will be his representative.

Some insurgents had demanded that De Gaulle appoint Soustelle as Minister Delegate for Algeria, and De Gaulle promised that he would give Soustelle another "important position."

### 阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线发表公报  严斥戴高乐的殖民主义叫嚣  突摩两国舆论也抨击吞并阿尔及利亚的阴谋

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线发表公报
    严斥戴高乐的殖民主义叫嚣
    突摩两国舆论也抨击吞并阿尔及利亚的阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线联络与执行委员会5日晚间在开罗发表公报，谴责戴高乐4日在阿尔及尔发表的演讲，是法国殖民主义政策的继续。公报指出，戴高乐只是继续奉行法国以前历届政府的政策。他的政策对于在阿尔及利亚独立的基础上通过谈判的解决办法的任何可能性关上了大门。
    公报指出，戴高乐的演讲无视联合国的建议，是对万隆、开罗和阿克拉会议所表示的支持阿尔及利亚获得自由和独立的国际舆论的一种挑战。公报说，戴高乐既然拒绝和平解决阿尔及利亚的冲突，他就应该对继续进行战争和战争可能扩及整个北非地区负完全责任。
    据纽约消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线发言人雅齐德5日在联合国就戴高乐关于阿尔及利亚问题的演说发表了声明，表示将要求联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    声明说：戴高乐将军的声明清楚地表明，他是故意不理会阿尔及利亚的根本问题，那就是全体人民争取独立并且非争取独立不可的斗争。
    戴高乐的演讲在突尼斯和摩洛哥两国首都也引起了一致的抨击。突尼斯执政党新宪政党的机关报“愿望报”的社论强调说，毫无疑问，阿尔及利亚人民进行了四年的英勇战争决不是为了让戴高乐前来，决不是为了让他向他们表示他的“关心”，也决不是为了完全“归并”到法兰西共和国去。
    突尼斯首都的另一家报纸“晨报”认为，戴高乐的演说是对阿尔及利亚人民的再一次宣战。
    有消息说，突尼斯首都人士还认为，戴高乐的这番话将在法国同北非的关系中增添困难。
    合众国际社4日从拉巴特发出的一条电讯引一位摩洛哥高级官员的话说，戴高乐的这次演讲是“一场大灾难”。他说，戴高乐在给摩洛哥国王的信里“所说的一切漂亮话在几分钟之内就烟消云散了”。
    摩洛哥执政党独立党机关报“旗帜报”在社论中强调指出，阿尔及利亚的独立是摩洛哥同法国之间一些基本问题获得解决的条件。
    巴黎“人道报”5日发表社论说，戴高乐在阿尔及尔的演说中根本不提对阿尔及利亚人有主要意义的真正唯一的问题，而是答应“要像对待法国人那样对待他们”。社论说，但是他们已经拿起武器，要争取称为阿尔及利亚人的权利。
    社论说，戴高乐在极右分子的鼓掌下用他们的语言说话。这不仅可能在阿尔及利亚，而且可能在整个北非造成严重的后果。
    另据阿尔及尔消息：戴高乐5日在阿尔及利亚的君士坦丁城和波尼城继续发表他的阿尔及利亚政策讲话。他继续阐明，他的政策是要把阿尔及利亚人变为法国人；他打算在三个月以后使一千万阿尔及利亚居民同法国其他地方的居民一起参加关于修改宪法的“公民表决”，然后，在阿尔及利亚举行一次选举，选出法国“公共当局的代表”。
    戴高乐在5日的谈话中还表明，他自己将担任法国内阁的阿尔及利亚驻节部长，现任的法国驻阿尔及利亚军总司令萨兰将是他的代表。
    一些叛乱分子曾经要求戴高乐任命苏斯戴尔作阿尔及利亚驻节部长，戴高乐答应说，他将给苏斯戴尔另外一个“重要职务”。
