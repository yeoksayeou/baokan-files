    Encountering Good People Everywhere in the New Society
    I am an old woman of seventy-three. On April 5th, I set out from Longyan, Fujian, to visit my daughter in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. First, I took a bus from Longyan to Zhangping. Because of my age and frailty, the bus ride made me dizzy, and I couldn't move after getting off. Just as I was sitting in the station feeling helpless, a comrade came up and asked me kindly, "Old lady, where are you going?" I handed him the directions my daughter had written. He took one look and said anxiously, "Ah, catching the train! The train station is more than half a kilometer away, and the train leaves in half an hour." Hearing this, I became even more anxious. I was just about to ask him to help me find a car when he had already run out of the station, turning back to say to me, "Wait a moment, I'll call for a car."

    Before long, he came running back, sweat streaming down his face, pushing a small cart for carrying goods. He hurriedly picked up my luggage and said, "All the cars outside are gone. Come on, I'll take you." When we arrived at the station, he instructed the train conductor to take care of me.

    The train started moving. After passing Yingtan, I suddenly felt alternating chills and fever, and finally developed a fever. I lay on the seat moaning. A comrade sitting next to me came over and asked, "Old woman, what's wrong?" I panicked and couldn't speak. At this moment, the train conductor also rushed over, touched my forehead, and said, "Oh dear, a fever! Please keep an eye on her, I'll go find the medical attendant."

    Soon, a young woman in her twenties wearing a white coat came and comforted me, saying, "Old lady, it's alright, it's just a cold." Then she gave me medicine and an injection, and sat down beside me to watch over me. The next morning, when I woke up, I saw that the medical attendant was still sitting by my side. Under their attentive care, I recovered from my illness by the afternoon. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, the female conductor helped me take my luggage off the train and asked a comrade at the station to call a pedicab for me, taking me all the way to my daughter's doorstep.

    Comrade Editor, I have lived for over seventy years and have never seen so many good people everywhere as I do now.

    新社会到处遇好人
    我是一个七十三岁的老人。4月5日由福建龙岩起身去江苏镇江看望女儿。先由龙岩乘汽车到漳平。因年老体衰，被汽车颠得头昏，下车后就不能行动。正当我坐在车站里为难的时候，一位同志走来很和气地问我：“老大娘，你到哪儿去？”我把女儿写的路线递给他，他接过一看，“啊，赶火车！”有些着急地说：“火车站离这有一里多路，再过半小时车就开了。”我一听，心里更急，刚想请他帮助找辆车子，他已跑出车站了，并回过头对我说：“你等一等，我喊车子去。”
    不一会，他又满脸流汗的跑回来，手里推着一辆运货的小车，急忙的拿起我的行李说：“外边车子都走光了，来，我送你去。”到了车站，又嘱咐列车员同志要照顾我。
    火车开动了。过了鹰潭，忽然混身冷一阵、热一阵，最后发烧起来，躺在座位上一声一声地哼，邻座上一位同志走过来问我：“老太太，怎么啦？”我心里发慌，说不出话来。这时，列车员同志也赶来，用手一摸我的头说：“呀，发烧！请你们照看一下，我去找卫生员去。”
    不一会，一个穿着白衣服的二十多岁的姑娘来了，安慰我说：“老大娘，不要紧，是感冒。”接着就给我吃药、打针，并在我身旁坐下来看着我。第二天早上，我醒来一看，那个卫生员同志，还坐在我的身旁。在他们的殷勤照顾下，我的病下午就好了。车到镇江了，那位女列车员帮助我把行李拿下车，又叫车站上的同志替我喊了三轮车，一直把我送到家门口。
    编辑同志，我长了七十多岁，没见过像现在到处都是好人。		  孙吴氏口述、秀珠记（肖林插图）
