Experience in Large-Scale Afforestation in Plain Areas
    (This report) The achievements of Lingbi County in the Huaibei Plain of Anhui Province in planting trees quickly, well, and economically provide experience for large-scale afforestation in plain areas. Last winter and this spring, the county planted more than 2.51 billion trees in a hundred days. Averaging the county's 640,000 people, each person planted 3,889 trees; on a daily average, the county planted more than 25 million trees every day. After inspections by the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, and mutual inspections and evaluations by the masses in the county's districts, townships, and communes, the survival rate of afforestation is generally above 90%.
    Large-scale afforestation in plain areas must first solve the difficulty of insufficient seedlings. The vast majority of seedlings for afforestation in Lingbi County were raised by the masses themselves. The Lingbi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions and planting whatever trees are available, vigorously implemented the policy of "self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-afforestation," and mobilized the masses to tap potential. The vast majority of the more than 2.5 billion trees planted throughout the county were resolved by relying on the masses themselves. All agricultural communes in the county established seedling-finding groups, going to barren mountains and wild areas with dense trees, using division of roots, division of trees, digging up wild saplings, and collecting local willow and locust tree seeds for afforestation. Various places purchased seedlings from the masses by exchanging goods and recording work points, and many masses also volunteered to contribute seedlings or invest in the commune. Agricultural communes exchanged what they had and adjusted seedlings. The masses also raised funds to purchase some fruit tree seedlings from other places that were not available locally.
    There are no large mountains in the plain areas, so where should large-scale afforestation be carried out? Lingbi County provides good experience in this regard. The total land area of Lingbi County is more than 3.6 million mu, of which cultivated land accounts for more than 2.93 million mu, and mountainous land is only more than 110,000 mu. In addition to building more than 100,000 mu of contiguous forests on mountainous land, the county planted trees along more than 1,500 li of rivers, more than 19,000 li of ditches, and more than 18,000 li of rural roads. It also comprehensively built 165 small farmland shelterbelts mainly composed of willow trees along ditches, roads, and rivers, with a total length of 591 li. These facts show that although there are few mountains in the plains, large-scale afforestation is still possible.
    Can afforestation be both large in scale and fast? Lingbi County adopted the method of afforestation shock brigades and closely integrating afforestation with agricultural production, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The county organized more than 2,500 afforestation shock teams and groups, with more than 37,000 people participating, ensuring that every commune had a shock team and every production team had a shock group. Yangding Township was still a backward township in afforestation work on March 15 this year. Through five days and five nights of afforestation shock work, a total of more than 120 million trees were planted, averaging 6,324 trees per person. The county's afforestation is also closely integrated with agricultural production. For example, in carrying out the water conservancy construction campaign, the masses are mobilized to build a place and plant trees there.
    In the past, there was no habit of large-scale afforestation in plain areas. How to ensure the quality of afforestation is a major issue. Lingbi County first divided the area into districts and points, and combined visits and internships at nurseries to train a large number of forestry workers. Throughout the county, from the beginning of tree planting, the "six guarantees" system of guaranteeing time, guaranteeing tasks, guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing work points, guaranteeing survival, and guaranteeing management was implemented in agricultural communes. In order to ensure that every tree planted survives, the county committee established two roving inspection teams to conduct general inspections; districts, townships, and communes generally established inspection teams, combined with agricultural production, to conduct inspections by commune, team, and section, and all substandard trees were earthed up or replanted. To date, more than 1.79 billion trees have been earthed up two to three times, and more than 225 million trees have been watered. At the same time, extensive fertilization work has been carried out. All agricultural communes in the county have established forest protection teams, formulated forest protection covenants, and universally inserted forest protection boundary markers in ditches, rivers, roads, and mountain fields. Due to the various measures taken to ensure quality, the trees planted in various parts of the county are generally straight, tightly earthed, adequately irrigated, and have a survival rate of over 90%.

    平原地区大规模造林经验
    本报讯　安徽省淮北平原的灵壁县多快好省地植树取得的成绩，给平原区提供了大规模造林的经验。这个县去冬今春在百日内植树二十五亿一千多万株。按全县六十四万多人平均，每人植树三千八百八十九株；按日平均，全县每天植树二千五百多万株。经过省、专区、县三级检查和全县各区、乡、社群众性的逐段互查评比，造林成活率一般在90％以上。
    平原地区大规模造林，首先要解决苗木不足的困难。灵壁县造林的树苗绝大部分都是群众自筹解决的。中共灵壁县委根据因地制宜，有什么树栽什么树的原则，大力贯彻“自采、自育、自造”的方针，发动群众挖掘潜力，全县栽植的二十五亿多株树苗绝大多数都是依靠群众自筹解决的。全县各农业社都成立了找苗组，到荒山野外树木密生的地方，利用分根、分棵、挖野生小树和采集当地的柳、拣树种来造林。各地以用物交换和记工分的办法收购群众的树苗，很多群众还纷纷自献树苗或作为向社投资。各农业社互通有无，调剂苗木。群众还集资向外地购买一部分本地没有的果树苗。
    平原地区没有大山，大规模造林究竟栽在什么地方？灵壁县在这方面提供了良好的经验。灵壁县土地总面积三百六十多万亩，其中耕地面积占二百九十三万多亩，山地只有十一万多亩。全县除在山地上营造十多万亩成片林外，河道植树一千五百多里，沟渠植树一万九千多里，农村道路植树一万八千多里，并依附沟渠、公路、河道全面营造以柳树为主的小型农田防护林一百六十五条，全长五百九十一里。这些事实说明：平原虽然山地少，还是可以大规模造林的。
    植树造林能不能又多又快？灵壁县采取造林突击队和紧密结合农业生产造林的办法，收到了多快的效果。全县共组织了造林突击队、组二千五百多个，参加人数达三万七千多人，做到社社有突击队，生产队有突击组。杨町乡在今年3月15日还是造林工作的落后乡，通过五天五夜突击造林苦战，共植树一亿二千多万株，每人平均六千三百二十四株。这个县造林还紧密结合农业生产。如在开展兴修水利运动中，发动群众兴修一处，就在那里植树。
    平原地区过去没有大规模造林的习惯，如何保证造林质量是个大问题。灵壁县首先分区、分点，结合苗圃参观实习，训练了大批林业员。全县从栽树开始就在农业社实行了包时间、包任务、包质量、包工分、包成活、包管理的六包制度。为了保证栽一株活一株，县委成立两个巡回检查组进行普遍检查；各区、乡、社普遍成立了检查组，结合农业生产逐社、逐队、逐段进行检查，对不合规格的都培土或重栽。到目前为止，已培土两到三次的有十七亿九千多万株，浇水达二亿二千五百多万株。同时，广泛开展了施肥工作。全县农业社都建立了护林队，制订了护林公约，在沟、河、路、山场普遍插护林界牌。由于采取各种措施保证质量，全县各地栽植的树木，一般都做到栽的直，培土紧，灌溉足，成活率在90％以上。
