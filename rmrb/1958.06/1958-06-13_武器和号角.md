    Weapons and Bugles
    Ying Lin
    Today, this newspaper reports that farmers in Guangdong Province posted over 120 million big-character posters during the rectification and commune movement, averaging five posters per person. Although we were not personally present, we can feel that these colorful big-character posters, like a surging tide, are impacting all decadent and backward ideas, rapidly changing people's spiritual outlook, and inspiring them to strive forward to the peaks of technological and cultural revolutions.
    After the productive forces of the farmers were liberated, they demanded further adjustment of the relationships between people, so that they could exert all their energy and make production develop faster.
    In the past, farmers also found weapons such as criticism to express this fiery emotion, but none were as effective as the big airing, big blooming, big debate, and big-character posters created during this rectification. Farmers used big-character posters not only to sharply criticize the shortcomings and errors in the work of leading cadres, but also to enthusiastically express their wishes and put forward tens of millions of rationalization proposals; not only to make this or that criticism of cadres, but also to carry out criticism and self-criticism among themselves, opening fire on all backward, selfish, and conservative things; not only to expose all outdated things, but also to enthusiastically praise new things, and to commend and spread advanced ideas and experiences; the content of criticism and praise touches on various issues in the work, and even couples, fathers and sons, and siblings also carry out mutual criticism. In short, the content of big-character posters is diverse, and whether it is criticism, praise, eulogy, rationalization proposals, or answers to questions, it is all closely centered on one issue: requiring the establishment of new relationships between people according to the communist ideological style, so as to develop the productive forces faster and better. In Pubei Township Agricultural Cooperative, Heyuan County, Guangdong Province, in order to solve the problem of the small and withered third-class rice, more than 10,000 big-character posters were posted at once, and the problem was solved shortly after the posters were posted. Third-class rice became first-class or second-class rice. This seems very strange, but it is an iron fact.
    Some people once had such concerns: not many farmers are literate, and cooperation has not been going on for very long, is it appropriate to use big-character posters to deal with problems? Facts have proved that this concern is superfluous, and this superfluous concern is due to an underestimation of the ideological awareness of the farmers. The vast number of farmers have not only written hundreds of millions of big-character posters, but also written them so well and so wonderfully. Not only is the content rich and correct, with both struggle and unity, but also the forms are diverse, including articles, mountain songs, etc., which is such a gratifying phenomenon.
    Big-character posters, the most effective form of promoting socialist democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, have been mastered by the vast number of farmers. They not only widely use big-character posters in the rectification and commune movement, but also use big-character posters in future work, production, and life, to pull out white flags and erect red flags, so that red flags fly everywhere.

    武器和号角
    应麟
    今天本报报道了广东省农民在整风整社中，贴出了一亿二千多万张大字报，平均每个人就写了五张。我们虽然没有亲临其境，但是可以感到，这万紫千红的大字报，就如汹涌澎湃的海潮一样，正在冲击着一切腐朽落后的思想，正在迅速地改变着人们的精神面貌，正在鼓起人们的冲天干劲，激励着他们向技术革命和文化革命的高峰奋勇前进。
    农民的生产力得到解放以后，就要求进一步调整人与人之间的关系，好使自己把浑身的干劲都使出来，使生产更快地向前发展。
    过去农民们也曾找到了表达这种火热的心情的批评等武器，但是没有这次整风中创造的大鸣大放大争大辩和大字报有效。农民们利用大字报，不仅尖锐地批评了干部领导工作中的缺点和错误，而且热情地表达了他们的愿望，提出了成千万条合理化建议；不仅对干部作了这样或那样的批评，而且在他们相互之间也展开了批评和自我批评，向一切落后、自私和保守的东西开了火；不仅有对一切陈腐的东西的揭露，而且有对新生事物的热烈歌颂，有对先进思想和经验的表扬和传播；批评表扬的内容，接触到工作中的各种问题，即使是夫妻、父子和兄弟姊妹之间也同样互相开展批评。总之，大字报的内容是多种多样的，而且不论是批评、表扬、歌颂、合理化建议或者对问题的答复，都紧紧地围绕着一个问题：要求按照共产主义的思想风格建立人与人之间的新关系，从而更快更好地发展生产力。广东省河源县埔前乡农业社，为了解决三类禾矮小枯黄的问题，一下子就贴出了一万多张大字报，大字报贴出不久，这个问题就得到了解决。三类禾变为一类禾或二类禾。这看来是很奇怪的，但是是铁的事实。
    曾经有些人有这样的顾虑：农民识字的不多，合作化也不太久，用大字报来处理问题是不是妥当？事实证明，这种顾虑是多余的，这种多余的顾虑是因为对农民的思想觉悟估计不足。广大的农民不但已经写了数以亿计的大字报，而且写得是那样的好，那样的妙。不仅内容丰富、正确，又有斗争又有团结，而且形式多种多样，有文章、山歌等等，这是多么可喜的现象。
    大字报，这个发扬社会主义民主，开展批评和自我批评的最有效的形式，已经被广大的农民所掌握。他们不但在整风整社中广泛使用了大字报，而且要在今后的工作、生产和生活中，也要使用大字报，用它来拔掉白旗，树立红旗，让红旗到处飘扬。
