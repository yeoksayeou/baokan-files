    Sugar Mill and Paper Mill Built Simultaneously
    A large-scale, modern sugar mill, the Putian Sugar Mill in Fujian Province, has recently begun construction. Once fully completed, this factory will be able to crush 4,000 tons of sugarcane per day and produce 400 to 450 tons of refined white sugar per day.
    To facilitate the utilization of sugar mill by-products, the factory is also equipped with a paper mill with a daily output of 100 tons, a solvent workshop, and an electrolytic salt plant. Since the comprehensive construction of the sugar mill and the attached paper mill began on the 22nd, progress has been rapid, and it is expected that partial production will begin by the end of next year.

    糖厂纸厂同时兴建
    一座规模巨大的现代化糖厂——福建省莆田糖厂，已在最近动工兴建。这座工厂全部建成后，每天能榨甘蔗四千吨，每天可生产机制白砂糖四百吨到四百五十吨。
    为了便于利用糖厂的副产品，这个工厂还设有日产一百吨的造纸厂、溶剂车间和电解食盐厂等各一座。现在，糖厂和附设的造纸厂等全部建筑工程从22日全面动工兴建以来，进展迅速，预计到明年底就可部分投入生产。
