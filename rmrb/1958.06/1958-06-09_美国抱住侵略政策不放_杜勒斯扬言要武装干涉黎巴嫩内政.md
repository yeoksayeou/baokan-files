　　The United States Clings to its Policy of Aggression
    Dulles Threatens Armed Intervention in Lebanese Internal Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: Washington - Dulles acknowledged reluctantly in a speech on the 6th that the world had undergone tremendous changes, but he indicated that the United States would continue to adhere to its aggressive foreign policy.

    In this speech, aimed at explaining the "basic ideas and principles" of American foreign policy, which the Secretary of State delivered to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he admitted that the United States "is facing the challenge of change," and that "in the past fifteen years, seven hundred million people in twenty countries have gained independence, and this trend will continue." This situation confronts the United States with a "drastic and worldwide" "political revolution."

    Dulles mentioned the "reactions" of the United States to these "challenges of change," the main point of which is the establishment of various aggressive military blocs outside the United Nations. He said that these military blocs are not "merely temporary expedients" but "should be maintained permanently."

    Dulles had to admit that some "discouraging things" had happened in the "free world," and that "what seems to dominate the free world is mainly division rather than harmony."

    Dulles devoted a large part of his speech to viciously slandering socialist countries. When talking about the summit conference and disarmament issues, on the one hand, he said that the Soviet Union "does not want war" and that "some common ground exists" between the United States and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, he spread doubts about the effectiveness of the summit conference, saying that "the Cold War cannot be ended with written formulas" and that whether the summit conference will achieve an agreement remains to be "seen." He also said that the question of whether to change the American policy against stopping nuclear tests "is a question that has not yet been decided." The current American attitude is the same as before, that the cessation of testing must depend on "several other conditions that can lead to a general disarmament agreement."

    In answering questions from senators, Dulles revealed that the United States intends to use the United Nations police force stationed in the Middle East to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs and expand the responsibilities of the United Nations police force to the Lebanese border.

　　美国抱住侵略政策不放
    杜勒斯扬言要武装干涉黎巴嫩内政
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：杜勒斯6日在一篇演说中无可奈何地承认世界已经发生了巨大的变化，但是他表明，美国将继续坚持它的侵略性外交政策。
    美国国务卿在参议院外交委员会发表的这篇旨在说明美国外交政策的“基本思想和原理”的演说中承认，美国“正在面临着改变的挑战”，“在最近十五年内有二十个国家的七亿人民获得了独立，而且这种趋势将继续下去”。这种情况使美国面对着一场“影响剧烈的、遍及全世界的”“政治革命”。
    杜勒斯提到美国对这些“改变的挑战”的“反响”，其中主要一点是在联合国之外建立了各种侵略性军事集团。他说，这些军事集团不是“仅仅暂时的权宜的东西”，而是“应该永久保持下去”。
    杜勒斯不得不承认，“自由世界”中发生了一些“引起泄气情绪的事情”，“支配着自由世界的看来主要是分歧而不是融洽”。
    杜勒斯在演说中用很大一部分篇幅恶毒地诬蔑社会主义国家。他在谈到最高级会议和裁军问题时一方面说，苏联“并不希望战争”，美、苏两国之间“某种共同基础是存在的”。另一方面他又散布对最高级会议效果的怀疑，说什么“冷战不能用文字公式来结束”，最高级会议是否会取得协议还要“等着瞧”。他还说，是否改变美国反对停止核试验的政策的问题“是一个还没有决定的问题”。目前美国的态度和从前一样，必须使停止试验取决于“可以导致一项总裁军协定的其他若干条件”。
    杜勒斯在回答参议员的问题时透露，美国有意利用驻在中东的联合国警察部队来干涉黎巴嫩内政，把联合国警察部队的职责扩充到黎巴嫩边境。
