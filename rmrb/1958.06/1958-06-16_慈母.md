    Loving Mother
    Li Wenbai
    The Wuqi County Rural Socialist Construction Activists' Congress had just ended, and Bai Zhongying hurriedly packed her luggage and rushed home. After attending the meeting in the county for more than ten days, she constantly worried about the black mule colt in the agricultural cooperative that she had nursed to life with her own milk. For two nights in a row, she dreamed that the mule colt was sick. After waking up, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep, wishing she had wings to fly back to the village.
    One day in June last year, the breeder Qi Yingxi ran over with a dejected look and said, "The donkey just gave birth to a mule colt and died; the mule colt has nothing to eat, it's shivering from hunger, I'm afraid it won't live long either." She didn't say a word, and hurriedly ran to the livestock pen. A crowd of people was already gathered there, discussing animatedly. Some said, "Alas! What bad luck! Our cooperative is short of livestock. We were hoping for this mule colt day and night, but as soon as it was born, the old donkey died. What a disappointment!" Others said, "Alas, this mule colt is so pitiful. If it were a lamb, we could find another ewe for it if the mother died. But this is a mule..."
    She pushed her way through the crowd, picked up the freshly born, wet mule colt, and carried it to her home. She took a bowl, unbuttoned her clothes, and squeezed her own milk. She squeezed half a bowl and fed it to the mule colt with a spoon. After a while, the mule colt stopped shivering and even tried to stand up. How happy she was! She quickly picked up the bowl again, squeezed some more milk, mixed it with thin rice porridge, and fed it to the mule.
    In the evening, the mule colt slept in their cave dwelling. Afraid that it would get cold, she even covered it with a tattered felt. That night, she got up three times to feed the mule colt milk. Her mother-in-law grumbled, "If you give your milk to the mule, what will our Pingzi eat? Even if you work hard to feed the mule, it will belong to the cooperative. How much will we get out of it? If it dies, it's not just our loss. This is really looking for trouble!"
      "Mom, you are a kind-hearted person. You don't even dare to watch someone kill a chicken, how can you bear to watch this mule starve to death? Besides, our cooperative is short of livestock. When a mule grows up, it can do the work of two oxen."
    "Mom, she's doing the right thing, don't complain about her." Qi Weichang, who was sleeping on the back kang bed, interrupted Zhongying and interjected, "I am the director of the cooperative, she is the production committee member and the head of the women's production team. We should take the lead in protecting the public interests of the cooperative. Our Pingzi is already over two years old and doesn't need milk anymore."
    Every day, Bai Zhongying squeezed her own milk, mixed it with some rice porridge, and fed the mule seven or eight times. After a few days, her nipples were swollen and cracked. But the mule was too small, and it wouldn't do to just feed it thin rice porridge, so she had to endure the pain and squeeze. Her nipples felt like they were being pricked with needles, and the pain was so unbearable that she wanted to stop squeezing. But then she thought: the cooperative is short of livestock. If I can endure some pain and raise the mule, it can do so much work for everyone in plowing, delivering manure, and pulling the millstone! Thinking of this, she gritted her teeth and continued to squeeze.
    The mule colt grew bigger and bigger every day, and it was eating more and more. Her milk and thin rice porridge alone were not enough. Zhongying accepted Weichang's suggestion and began to squeeze goat milk for the mule. The cooperative's sheepfold was in Jiugou Village, which was three miles away from their village. And goat milk had to be squeezed in the morning. How could she squeeze goat milk without delaying cooking time, affecting production, and still squeeze goat milk? At the second crow of the rooster, she would get up, carry a small porcelain jar, take a stick, and lead her big black dog as a companion to Jiugou Village in the dark. Each time she would squeeze the milk of eight goats. After filling the small porcelain jar, she would hurry back home. When she returned home, the sky was just beginning to lighten. She put down the milk jar and busied herself with cooking, cleaning the house, and after eating, she would urge the female cooperative members to go to the fields with her. In order to feed and care for the mule colt in a timely manner, she would carry the mule colt to the fields with her every time she went to work, and during breaks she would be busy feeding the mule colt.
    One day, after being awakened by the crowing of the rooster, she discovered that the cave dwelling was already bright. She secretly hated herself for sleeping so soundly and missing the time to squeeze goat milk. She sat up with a start and hurriedly put on her clothes. What? Weichang, who was sleeping next to her, was gone! Looking again, the door was open a crack. Just as she was feeling puzzled, the cave door "creaked" open. Weichang walked in carrying a goat milk jar. "What? You..." Before she could finish a sentence, Weichang interrupted her, saying, "I brought the milk back, don't worry, sleep a little longer." While she was getting dressed, she continued, "You worked all day yesterday and attended a meeting until midnight." Weichang said with a smile, "Didn't you also work all day and do needlework at night?"
    From then on, the couple always competed to get up early and squeeze goat milk. Once, just as the rooster crowed for the first time, Zhongying got up. Weichang was sleeping soundly. She hurriedly and quietly put on her clothes and picked up the milk jar. As soon as she opened the door, it was pitch black, and it was drizzling. What to do? She stood at the door, hesitating. Suddenly, she heard Weichang toss and turn on the kang bed. Afraid of waking him up, she didn't even bother to call her dog and left. It was so dark! Relying on her familiarity with the road, she stumbled forward, one foot high and one foot low. While crossing the mountain, she fell twice in a row, covered in mud. When she returned home, Weichang was just about to set out to meet her; when he saw her appearance, he complained, "It's raining so hard, you! Why didn't you call me to go?" She said with a smile, "I was afraid that you wouldn't get enough rest and it would affect the cooperative's production!" Her mother-in-law grumbled, "Hmph, still laughing! What if you catch a cold!" While changing clothes, Zhongying comforted the old woman, saying, "Mom, we young people can handle it, we won't catch a cold."
    After two months, the mule colt gradually grew taller and bigger. It ran around the village all day long, and when it was hungry, it would come back and rub against her with its head, wanting to eat. When she went to the fields, it would also follow her to the fields and lie down beside her. More than ten days ago, when she set off to attend the conference in the county, just as she descended the cliff, the mule colt neighed and chased after her from behind. No matter how she tried to drive it away, it refused to go back. Later, Weichang ran over and held the mule colt, and she finally left the village. ...
    She walked along thinking, fifty miles without stopping for a rest. Seeing that she could see the village after turning the bend in the mountain ahead, she became even more anxious and quickened her pace. As soon as the village appeared before her eyes, the mule colt, lying under the locust tree on the cliff, jumped and ran towards her, burying its head in her arms and rubbing against her left and right, humming "mm—mm—" in its mouth, its two big, round eyes looking at Zhongying's face. Zhongying's face was full of smiles. She stopped and affectionately stroked the mule colt's head and spine, as if her most beloved child was standing in front of her.

    慈母

    吴旗县农村社会主义建设积极分子大会刚结束，白忠英就匆忙地收拾起行李往家跑。在县上开了十来天会，她经常惦念着用自己的奶汁喂活的农业社那头黑骡驹。有两个晚上她连续梦见骡驹生了病，醒来后翻来复去睡不着，恨不得长上双翅飞回村去。
    去年六月里的一天，饲养员齐应喜垂头丧气地跑来说：“草驴刚生下一条骡驹就死了；骡驹没啥吃，饿的直抖，怕也活不长啦。”她一句话也没说，急忙跑到牲畜圈去。那里已经围了一堆人，七嘴八舌地议论着。有的说：“唉！真霉气！咱社里牲口正不够用，白天黑夜地盼望着这条骡驹，偏偏刚生下，老驴就死了，盼了一场空。”有的说：“唉，这骡驹怪可怜的。要是一只羊羔的话，老羊死了咱还能给配。可是，这是一头骡子啊，……”
    她从人群中拨开一条路，把刚生下来的湿淋淋的骡驹抱起来，抱到自己家里，拿了一个碗，解开衣服扣子挤自己的奶。挤了半碗，用匙子给骡驹灌到嘴里。过了一阵，骡驹不颤抖了，还试着往起站。她多么高兴啊，连忙又拿起碗挤了些奶，掺合上些稀米汤，给骡子灌下去。
    晚上，骡驹就睡在她们的窑里。怕它凉着，她还给盖了一块烂毡。那一夜，她点着灯起来三次，挤奶给骡驹吃。婆婆唠叨着说：“把奶给骡子吃了，让咱萍子吃啥？就是费上千辛万苦，把骡子喂活也是社里的，到咱们跟前能有多少点？死了，也不是咱一家的损失。真是寻找麻烦哩！”
      “妈，你老人家是个慈心肠人，平日连一只鸡也不敢看人家杀，难道你忍心眼看这头骡子饿死吗？再说咱社里正缺牲口用，一头骡子喂大能顶两条犍牛用。”
    “妈，她作的对，你不要抱怨她。”睡在后炕的齐维昌打断了忠英的话插嘴说：“我是社主任，她是生产委员，又是妇女生产队长。在爱护社的公共利益上，咱应该起带头作用。咱萍子已经两岁多了，早就可以不吃奶了。”
    白忠英每天挤出自己的奶来，掺合上些米汤，给骡子灌七、八次。过了几天，她的奶挤肿、挤烂了。但是骡子太小，光给喝稀米汤是不行的，只好忍着疼挤。奶头像针刺一样，疼的她实在忍不住了，便停住手不想再挤。可是又一想：社里正缺牲口用，要是自己忍些痛，把骡子喂大了，耕地、送粪、拉碾磨，能给大家顶多少事呀！想到这里，她就又咬着牙再往下挤。
    骡驹一天比一天大，吃的也越来越多，光靠她的奶和稀米汤不够吃了。忠英接受维昌的建议，开始挤羊奶给骡子吃。社里的羊圈在九沟村，离她们住的村有三里路。羊奶又必须在早晨挤。要不耽误做饭时间，不影响生产，又要挤羊奶，怎么办呢？鸡叫二遍，她就起来提着小磁罐，拿着一根棍子，引着大花狗做伴，摸黑到九沟村去。每次挤八只羊的奶，小磁罐挤满后连忙往回跑。回到家里，天还刚麻麻亮，她放下奶罐又忙着做饭，打扫屋子，吃罢饭还要督促女社员和自己一起上地。为了及时喂养和照顾方便，每次上地她都把骡驹抱到地里，休息的时候就忙着给骡驹吃东西。
    有一天，她被鸡啼声催醒后，发现窑里已经大亮了，她暗暗恨自己睡的太实，把挤羊奶的时间误了。一轱辘坐起来，慌忙穿衣服。怎么？身旁睡着的维昌不见了！再一看，门开着个缝。她正在莫名其妙，窑门“吱”的一声开了。维昌提着羊奶罐子走了进来。“怎么？你……”她一句话还没说完，维昌就插嘴说：“我把奶挤回来了，你不要耽心，好好再睡一阵吧。”她一边穿衣，一边接着说：“你昨天劳动了一天，晚上还开了半夜会。”维昌笑着说：“你还不是也劳动了一天，晚上还做针线来着？”
    从此，两口子就老是争着起早挤羊奶。有一次，鸡刚叫头一声，忠英就起来了。维昌正睡的香甜。她慌忙轻手轻脚地穿好衣服，提上奶罐子。刚一开门，乌黑一片，雨淅沥沥地下着。这怎么办？她站到门口犹豫起来了。忽然听见维昌在炕上翻了个身。怕他醒来，她忙的连做伴的狗都没顾上叫就走。天好黑啊！凭着路熟，她高一脚低一脚地向前摸，翻山的时候一连摔了两跤，满身是泥。回到家里，维昌正准备动身来接她；一见她的样子，就抱怨地说：“这么大的雨，你！为啥不叫我去？”她笑着说：“怕你休息不好影响社里生产呀！”婆婆嘟噜着说：“哼，还笑哩！看着了凉怎办！”忠英一边换衣裳，一边安慰老人家说：“妈，咱年青人顶得住，不会着凉。”
    过了两个月，骡驹渐渐长高长大了，整天满村乱跑，饿了就回来用头挨依着她，要吃东西。她上地的时候它也跟到地里，躺在旁边。十来天以前，在她动身到县上参加大会的时候，刚下了嶮畔，骡驹就吼叫着从后面追来，怎么赶它都不肯回去。后来维昌跑来把骡驹抱住，她才离开了村子。……
    她一边想一边走，五十里路没歇一息。眼看转过前面那座山弯就看见村子了，她心里越发急，不由加快了脚步。村落刚一出现在她的眼前，在嶮畔上那棵槐树下面卧着的骡驹，就连跳带奔地向她扑来，把头伸向她的怀里左右挨依着，嘴里还“嗯—嗯—”地哼着，两只滴溜溜的大眼睛，看着忠英的脸。忠英脸上堆满了微笑，停住脚，亲切地用手抚摸着骡驹的头和脊梁，就像面前站着的是她的最喜爱的孩子。
