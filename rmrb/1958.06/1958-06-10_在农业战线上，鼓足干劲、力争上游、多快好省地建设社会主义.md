On the Agricultural Front, Display Full Enthusiasm, Strive for the Top, and Build Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture
(I)
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always closely valued and tightly led agriculture, and the local Party committees at all levels in various provinces have also always placed the focus of their leadership work on agriculture. Agriculture is advancing on the road of "continuous revolution" as directed by Comrade Mao Zedong. First, immediately following the successful realization of land reform, the agricultural cooperativization movement was launched, completing the task of agricultural cooperativization ahead of schedule and basically realizing the collective ownership of the main means of agricultural production. The high tide of the agricultural socialist revolution, which began in the second half of 1955, in turn triggered a leap forward in agricultural production in 1956, which laid the foundation for the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan. The total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations and the output of major crops (grain and cotton) completed the first Five-Year Plan and slightly exceeded it. In a short period of just over a year, basically a high tide, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically realized among more than 500 million peasants, which triggered a leap forward development in agricultural production and avoided the various losses that such a great transformation might have caused. This is a victory of great significance and world influence.
    On this basis, in 1957, along with the rectification movement of the entire Party and people and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in the cities, a general debate on the two roads of capitalism and socialism was also carried out in the countryside, and a movement to rectify the Party and communes was launched, achieving a basic victory in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. On the one hand, it struck at the anti-socialist elements in the countryside, criticized capitalist spontaneous tendencies, consolidated the socialist position, and discredited capitalism. On the other hand, it overcame the "three styles" and "five airs" and right-leaning conservative ideas of the cadres, and the peasant masses were also educated, criticizing their own erroneous ideas and backward habits brought from the old society. On the basis of socialist ownership, this further improved the relationship between people, improved the relationship between cadres and the masses in the countryside and in the agricultural cooperatives, thereby forming a situation of ease of mind and vitality, and the enthusiasm, creativity, and revolutionary drive of hundreds of millions of peasants were unprecedentedly promoted. The hundreds of millions of peasants who have gained great liberation have mastered the general line of "displaying full enthusiasm, striving for the top, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" as instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and launched a new upsurge in agricultural production in the winter of 1957. This new upsurge is now continuing to develop rhythmically, wave after wave, with the momentum of "making high mountains bow their heads and making rivers give way."
    The sprouts of technological revolution and cultural revolution have already grown in the countryside. In the near future, people will see them blossom and bear fruit, which will greatly increase agricultural labor productivity and promote a higher level of agricultural production.
    These are the brilliant achievements made by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's guidelines and policies on socialist transformation and socialist construction on the agricultural front. Underestimating these brilliant achievements and exaggerating the shortcomings in our work will dampen the enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres, and will not promote the cause of socialism, but rather hinder it.
    Since the winter of 1955, three years, three winters and springs, from the perspective of agricultural production, the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, due to a gust of wind against the so-called "rash advance," made the broad masses and cadres slacken and lose heart. Water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation were not only not as good as the winter and spring of this year, but also not as good as the first upsurge that began in the winter of 1955; the multiple cropping index in 1957, the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice, potatoes, and corn were also not as good as in 1956, and were even worse than this year. As a result, in 1956, under severe natural disasters, grain production still increased more, while in 1957, natural conditions were not worse than in 1956, but grain production increased very little. The situation in the three years was high at both ends and low in the middle. This fully proves that: resolutely implement the Party's line of socialist construction, follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions in the preface to the high tide of socialism in the countryside, focus on criticizing and overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas in the speed of socialist construction, display full enthusiasm, strive for the top, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, will set off a production craze among hundreds of millions of working people, a great leap forward in production, and a great leap forward in all socialist construction undertakings; conversely, if we deviate from the line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, regard the leap forward as a "rash advance," and oppose the so-called "rash advance," production and other socialist construction undertakings will develop slowly and stagnate.
    In the second half of 1956 and the spring of 1957, when encountering the "anti-rash advance" storm, some places on the agricultural front persevered and were less affected by this storm; while some places and some comrades showed wavering, their thinking became blurred, they had complaints, and lacked the courage to fight. We should learn a profound lesson from this.

(II)
    To achieve a leap forward in production, we must first dare to leap forward ideologically. In the past few years, the back-and-forth movements have left some issues entangled in the minds of some cadres on the agricultural front, and their thinking has been constrained. Among them, the fundamental issues are two: one is to fully estimate the enthusiasm and creativity of cooperative farmers, and the other is to treat the well-to-do middle peasants. The former is about the speed of socialist construction, and the latter is about the struggle between the two roads. It is necessary to clarify these entangled ideological viewpoints and liberate our minds, so as to truly dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, thereby promoting a great leap forward in production.
    We cannot use the outdated standards for measuring individual peasants to measure cooperative farmers
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "We must respect materialism and dialectics. People's thoughts should correctly reflect objective reality." "People's thoughts must adapt to the changed objective situation." Objective reality is constantly changing and developing, and people's thoughts cannot stagnate and cannot use old eyes to see new things. With the completion of agricultural cooperativization, the basic realization of socialist transformation in terms of the ownership of the means of production, and the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts, farmers have undergone fundamental changes in history. Many things that were unimaginable and impossible in the era of the individual economy have become the actual actions of thousands of cooperative farmers in the high tide of agriculture. However, some comrades, because their thinking lags behind reality, still use the standards of individual peasants that have been deeply imprinted in their minds for many years to measure the cooperative farmers who have gained great liberation and are full of vitality, and believe that they cannot "cut off history," believing that farmers cannot accept this or that. This regards many things that are objectively possible, or can be done with effort, as impossible and does not do them; the result is adherence to conventions and conservatism.
    Conservative thinking is subjectivism divorced from reality
    People's thoughts cannot adapt to the development of the objective situation, underestimate the objective situation, and consider things that can be done with effort as impossible and do not do them. This right-leaning conservative thinking, like trying to do things that are really impossible beyond the conditions permitted by the objective situation, is divorced from reality and is subjectivism. History proves that both will bring losses to the people's revolutionary cause. Facts in recent years have also proved that the losses caused by individual shortcomings in the high tide of socialist construction are much smaller than the losses caused by right-leaning conservatism, which does not do things that can be done. However, some comrades, due to a habitual laziness in their thinking, often confuse "right-leaning conservatism and contentment with the status quo" with "proceeding from reality," as if right-leaning conservatism is not divorced from reality. In fact, objective reality requires progress, and the "seedlings" of progress have already sprouted in reality. Right-leaning conservatism and contentment with the status quo is to suppress the "seedlings" of progress, which is obviously subjectivism divorced from reality. In the process of progress, minor problems and certain losses are relatively easy to see at a glance. The losses caused by not doing many things that could have been done due to conservative thinking are often easily overlooked and unnoticed. In order to promote the current high tide to move forward, it is especially necessary to be vigilant in this regard.
    Tailism and coercion and commandism both violate the mass line
    The mass line is our Party's fine tradition and style. We need the mass line in the revolutionary period, and we also need the mass line in the construction period. The objects of agriculture and rural work are hundreds of millions of peasants, with a large quantity and a wide area, so we must resolutely act in accordance with the mass line. The mass line is that the Party takes the mass line, leads the masses forward, and leads the masses to revolution. At any time and in the face of anything, the masses always have three different attitudes: advanced, intermediate, and backward. The key is to win over the masses in the intermediate state, which is often the majority of the masses. Disregarding the level of awareness of the masses, especially the level of awareness of the intermediate masses, and taking coercive and commanding methods, the result is detachment from the masses. This is of course a violation of the mass line and should of course be opposed. Conversely, following the backward masses, and regarding the opinions of the backward masses as the opinions of the entire masses, the result is not to educate the backward to learn from the advanced and lead the masses forward, but to make the advanced learn from the backward, be content with the status quo, and maintain backwardness. This tailism is inconsistent with the interests of the masses. Sometimes it seems to conform to the current and partial interests of the masses, but it is still inconsistent with the long-term and fundamental interests of the masses, so it is also essentially detached from the masses and also violates the mass line, which must also be opposed. Comrade Li Dagui, the secretary of the branch in Lijiawan, Junxian County, Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, precisely because he did not act according to the opinions of the backward elements in the masses, disregarding the opposition of those backward elements and even his own father and wife, but united some activists, studied and experimented, and finally realized water diversion and irrigation, changed the drought and poverty of Lijiawan for many generations, and promoted the water conservancy upsurge in the entire Xiangyang Prefecture. The struggle between Zhu Guoyun, a 22-year-old female director of the Sanhe Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, and the old technician Chen Daoyin, and the ideological struggle from cadres to the masses in Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province in implementing large-scale land leveling, their processes of solving problems are all examples of taking the mass line to lead the masses forward. In the current new high tide of agriculture, there are many such examples. We should learn from these moving examples and learn to correctly act in accordance with the Party's traditional style of the mass line without either coercion or commandism or committing the error of tailism.
    To be slaves of nature, or to be masters of nature
    To increase crop yields, we must fight against nature. In social struggle, there are two different ideas: contentment with the status quo and transforming the status quo. Similarly, in the current struggle against nature, there are also two different ideas: succumbing to nature and transforming nature. Transforming nature will inevitably encounter many difficulties, large and small. Only by daring to experiment, daring to create, not being afraid of difficulties, not being afraid of failure; when problems arise, we must not be afraid of blame, but analyze the reasons, find out the shortcomings, and make persistent efforts, can we gradually transform nature and be masters of nature. The three reforms in Anhui Province, the ditch reforms in Tianjin area, and the Manggou River management in Jiyuan County, Henan Province, are all successful in this way. We should learn from these advanced examples and oppose the thinking of daring not to create, daring not to experiment, fearing difficulties, fearing failure, and admitting cowardice and defeat in the face of harsh natural conditions, and even more oppose the attitude of fault-finding and pouring cold water. Because the end result of this kind of thinking and attitude can only make people succumb to nature and be slaves of nature. Of course, to transform nature, we must also use the universal laws of natural phenomena to achieve the goal of transformation. For example, the law of water is that it flows from high to low. If people want to use water to irrigate dry mountains and change the dry natural appearance of mountain areas, then build a dam to raise the water level, or dig a canal from a higher place with a water source to bring the water over. This is using natural laws to transform nature. China's agricultural production is still largely dominated by nature. However, we must have the determination, confidence, and perseverance to fight against nature, transform nature, and make it serve mankind.
    Promote advanced experience in increasing production and adapt to local conditions
    Advanced experience in increasing production must be tested and actively promoted. This should be affirmed first. After affirming this, there comes the question of "adapting to local conditions" or "mechanical copying." Promoting advanced experience and adapting to local conditions are not contradictory. Adapting to local conditions means that when promoting advanced experience, we must adapt to local conditions and oppose copying. If we leave the promotion of advanced experience and only do things according to the local old experience and old habits, then there is no question of adapting to local conditions at all. In the past few years, there has been such a phenomenon: when the enthusiasm came, we emphasized the promotion of advanced experience and did not talk much about adapting to local conditions; when the enthusiasm waned, we emphasized adapting to local conditions, and the more we emphasized it, the more excessive it became, emphasizing it as if advanced experience could not be promoted at all. This point must also be clarified in the thinking of cadres.
    "Absolutely foolproof" and "inevitable"
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us to "fully mobilize the masses and everything through experimentation." When we promote improved varieties, new agricultural tools, and reasonable close planting, timely early sowing, and all advanced measures to increase production, we must act in accordance with this instruction. At the same time, when conducting experiments, we should dare to experiment and not be afraid of failure. The things to be experimented are originally things that are not certain to succeed. How can we completely avoid failure? All inventions in the world have undergone many failures in the experimental process before finally achieving success. When actively promoting after the experiment is successful, we should strive to reduce losses, and even avoid losses. However, it is also impossible to be absolutely foolproof. Especially in terms of agricultural production, because the conditions are too complex and the changes are too many, things that have been successfully tested may not be completely certain to be successful when implemented in another piece of land with roughly the same conditions in the second year. A small number of losses are always inevitable. The theory of inevitability is correct. Not only is agricultural technology work like this, but most of the work is also like this. We cannot use being absolutely foolproof as a standard to measure the success or failure of our work. For shortcomings in our work that are difficult to completely avoid, we should adopt a positive attitude, help study, and find ways to overcome them. This is conducive to protecting the enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres, encouraging instead of discouraging, and being a promoter instead of a detractor.
    Correctly treat the well-to-do middle peasants
    The above mainly talks about some ideological problems regarding the speed of socialist construction. The issue of well-to-do middle peasants is related to the struggle between the two roads in the countryside.
    Well-to-do middle peasants are part of the peasants and also the upper petty bourgeoisie in the countryside. Their position in the socialist revolution is different from that in the democratic revolution. Some well-to-do middle peasants with more serious capitalist spontaneous tendencies resisted cooperativization in the process of agricultural cooperativization. After being forced to join the cooperative, they wanted to engage in capitalism within the cooperative, and they made trouble whenever they had the opportunity, wanting to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently, and even wanting to ruin the cooperative. These well-to-do middle peasants openly took command in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, representing the capitalist road. Because the rich peasants had already been defeated together with the landlords in the land reform, they were economically defeated and politically discredited. And these well-to-do middle peasants have capital, so they became the open commanders. This is a characteristic of our country's countryside. The struggle between the two roads in the countryside has not ended, and this is still the main contradiction throughout the transition period. However, well-to-do middle peasants are also part of the peasants, so this contradiction mainly manifests itself as a contradiction among the people, which must be handled by handling contradictions among the people, using persuasion rather than suppression, and strengthening socialist ideological work to criticize their capitalist spontaneous thoughts and behaviors. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of uniting and transforming them through struggle. Conversely, relaxing the ideological struggle against them and adopting a policy of accommodation and concession to them economically will not only fail to achieve the goal of uniting and transforming them, but will also weaken the socialist position in the countryside. In the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, when anti-socialist elements were most rampant in the countryside, some places had this lesson. Now, this struggle has not ended, and we must also pay attention to preventing the growth of capitalist factors within agricultural cooperatives, and we must also estimate that some well-to-do middle peasants will still make trouble whenever they have the opportunity. Therefore, we must also clarify this issue in the thinking of cadres.
    Judging from the ideological situation of cadres on the agricultural front, clarifying these entangled issues is beneficial to liberating our minds.

(III)
    The new high tide of agricultural production that began last winter has created amazing achievements in farmland capital construction such as water conservancy construction, low-lying land transformation, soil and water conservation, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and afforestation, which is not only incomparable to 1957, but also greatly exceeds 1956 under the high tide. From the beginning of this movement, it was engaged in farmland capital construction and other basic construction, changing agricultural production conditions, and marching towards nature. This is a prominent feature of the current high tide of agricultural production. The characteristics of this high tide are also manifested in its large scale, full enthusiasm, fast progress, good quality, many creations, comprehensive content, and generally speaking, doing more and talking less, advanced indicators, specific measures, in-depth leadership, timely inspection and evaluation, and mutual promotion between industry and agriculture and between urban and rural areas.
    With the arrival of the spring plowing and sowing season and the wheat harvest season, the center of the movement has shifted from farmland capital construction to field production. This year's summer harvest crops are better than any previous year. Rapeseed is expected to increase by 10 million dan compared to last year, and winter wheat has also achieved a great harvest that breaks through the previous growth rate. This is the first major victory shown by the new high tide of agriculture in increasing crop yields. In addition, according to the plans of various provinces, this year's multiple cropping index will increase from 139.5% to 144.8%, an increase of 5.3% compared to last year. Among them, the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice, potatoes, and corn will increase by nearly 200 million mu compared to last year; the sowing of 90 million mu of cotton has been completed, of which the cotton fields with irrigation facilities have increased by 20 million mu compared to last year, and the cotton fields using the Daizi cotton improved variety have increased by 17 million mu compared to last year; coupled with the achievements already made in water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and improvement of agricultural tools, the widespread implementation of yield-increasing measures such as selecting improved varieties, reasonable close planting, and timely early sowing, the yield-increasing targets planned by various provinces do have numerical basis. As long as we give full play to the revolutionary drive of hundreds of millions of peasants, more widely promote the collective and communist spirit of the masses, and continue to push the high tide forward, this year's agricultural production increase will definitely break the conventional growth rate and greatly exceed the national plan.
    Since last winter, animal husbandry work has also improved significantly. The abnormal death of draught animals has basically stopped, and they are also growing better than in previous years. The breeding movement of draught animals has already started in many places. The number of pigs raised in the first quarter has reached more than 160 million, which has exceeded this year's national plan target. The current problem is that the supply of breeding stock and the prevention and control of animal diseases cannot keep up. This is a shortcoming in our work and must be actively improved. The breeding and young animals bred this year will not be used for two or three years, so we must not be optimistic and must work harder.
    Of the grain yield per mu targets of "400, 500, and 800 jin" stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, 65 counties (cities) had already reached or exceeded them in 1957; of the cotton yield per mu targets of 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton, 64 counties (cities) had already reached or exceeded them in 1957. According to the plans of various provinces, several hundred counties (cities) will reach the above targets this year. The number of counties (cities) reaching the above yield increase targets next year and the year after will undoubtedly increase. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed that from now on, we should greatly develop oil crops and raise oil crops to the same position as grain and cotton. The enthusiasm for increasing oil crop production has also greatly increased in various places. According to the plans of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, taking into account the major floods and droughts that may be encountered, striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule within the second Five-Year Plan or a little over one or two years is entirely realistic. Compared with the highest levels in capitalist countries, some of the per-unit yield targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program have already caught up with or exceeded them, and some crops can catch up with or exceed them by increasing about twice as much on the basis of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program. We are fully confident that within fifteen years, not only will the output of agricultural products in our country, but also the per-unit yield of various major crops, catch up with and exceed capitalist countries, which should be said to be achievable.
    Overfulfilling the 1958 agricultural production increase plan, realizing the Forty Articles Program ahead of schedule, and catching up with and exceeding the output of agricultural products and the per-unit area yield of major crops in capitalist countries in fifteen years is the specific task of implementing the Party's general line of displaying full enthusiasm, striving for the top, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results on the agricultural front.

(IV)
    In order to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, we must adapt to the situation of the high tide and the requirements of the great leap forward in production to improve our work. Here are three points: grasp ideology, grasp measures, and grasp technological revolution.
    First, grasp ideology. "Ideology is the soul, and politics is the commander." Strengthen socialist ideological and political work in the countryside to ensure the strong morale of the high tide to continue to advance. At the same time, we must also constantly improve our own thinking, go deep into the mass movement of the great leap forward in production, so that our own thinking can adapt to the development of the objective situation and prevent and overcome the growth of conservative thinking. Study Comrade Mao Zedong's ideological style, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the Sixty Articles on Work Methods, and study Comrade Mao Zedong's application of materialism and dialectics to practical work. And combine with the still unfinished rectification movement to further check our work, more deeply expose the errors of bureaucracy and subjectivism in our work (whether from dogmatism or empiricism), so as to further improve our thinking.
    Second, in terms of measures to increase production, grasp water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, and seeds to improve agricultural production conditions, and grasp comprehensive yield-increasing technical measures centered on reasonable close planting and strengthening field management. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently formulating plans item by item in accordance with the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program and the "Sixty Articles on Work Methods" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong to formulate the fourteen agricultural plans. At present, in terms of water conservancy, while expanding the irrigated area, we must strengthen irrigation management, improve irrigation methods, and use water rationally. In terms of fertilizer, we must not only strive to increase the quantity, but also pay attention to improving the quality, improve fertilizer production, storage, and application methods, and improve fertilizer efficiency. In terms of reasonable close planting and other yield-increasing measures, new advanced experience is constantly emerging, and we must be good at using on-site meetings and visits to summarize and promote them in a timely manner to improve our past shortcomings in this regard, which were not specific or timely enough. Leveling land and rationally utilizing land are necessary for a leap forward in production, and can also expand the cultivated area. We should generally advocate implementation, and the country can increase the cultivated area by at least tens of millions of mu to 100 million mu, which is promising.
    Third, grasp technological revolution. Gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization through the current movement to improve agricultural tools. We have long had superstitions about agricultural mechanization. Relying on large-scale industry and large-scale national investment. This was also copied. Now this superstition has been broken. Judging from the current upsurge of the masses in improving agricultural tools, the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives in increasing public accumulation, and the enthusiasm of various places in developing local industries, a high tide of technological revolution will appear in the countryside in the near future. With the development of China's socialist industrialization, the backward state of China's agricultural technology equipment will undoubtedly be fundamentally changed at a relatively fast speed, and agricultural mechanization will be realized.
    Many of our comrades also have superstitions about agricultural science and technology, seeing it as very mysterious, as if it is "out of reach," and not going to study it well, which is very wrong. We must be determined to work hard to learn agricultural science and technology, plant experimental fields, and strive in the direction of being both red and expert.
    In order to give play to the strength of scientific and technical personnel in the great leap forward in agriculture, and also to further transform their thinking, recently, a technical team of about 250 people was organized from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Beijing Agricultural University to go to the countryside, which not only increased the technical strength on the front line of agricultural production, but also enabled them to be educated in the practice of the peasant masses.
    In this way, the combination of top and bottom, the combination of cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and the masses, and the combination of science and technology and the production practice of peasants, can further promote the upsurge of improving cultivation technology, promote the technological revolution in agriculture, and build a modernized socialist agriculture with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　在农业战线上，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义
　　农业部部长　廖鲁言
　　（一）
    党中央和毛泽东同志对于农业一直是密切重视，抓紧领导的，各省各级地方党委也一直是把领导工作的中心放在农业方面。农业是在毛泽东同志所指示的“不断革命”的道路上前进的。首先，紧接着胜利地实现了土地制度的改革以后，就开始了农业合作化运动，提前完成了农业合作化的任务，基本实现了农业主要生产资料的集体所有制。1955年下半年开始的农业社会主义革命的高潮又引起了1956年农业生产的跃进，这就为胜利完成第一个五年计划打下了基础，农业、副业的总产值和主要农作物（粮食和棉花）的产量完成了第一个五年计划，还略有超过。在短短一年多的时间内，基本上是一个高潮，就在五亿多农民中基本实现了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，引起了农业生产的跃进发展，并且避免了这种伟大的变革可能引起的种种损失，这是具有伟大意义和世界影响的胜利。
    在这个基础上，1957年在全党全民整风运动和城市里反对资产阶级右派的斗争的同时，农村里也普遍进行了关于资本主义和社会主义两条道路的大辩论，展开了整党整社运动，在思想战线上和政治战线上取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利。一方面，打击了农村中的反社会主义分子，批判了资本主义自发倾向，巩固了社会主义阵地，搞臭了资本主义。另一方面，克服了干部的“三风”、“五气”和右倾保守思想，农民群众也得到了教育，批判了自己从旧社会带来的错误思想和落后习惯。这就在社会主义所有制的基础上，进一步改善了人与人的关系，改善了农村中和农业社中的干群关系，从而形成一种心情舒畅、生动活泼的局面，使几亿农民的积极性、创造性和革命干劲从来没有过地高度发扬起来。获得了大解放的几亿农民，掌握了党中央和毛泽东同志所指示的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，在1957年冬季掀起了农业生产的新高潮。这个新高潮，现在正以“让高山低头、要河水让路”的气势，一浪接着一浪地有节奏地继续发展。
    技术革命和文化革命的萌芽已经在农村中生长出来，不远的将来，人们将会看到它开花结果，将大大提高农业劳动生产率，促进农业生产更高度地发展。
    这就是党中央和毛泽东同志关于社会主义改造和社会主义建设的方针路线在农业战线上所取得的辉煌成就。对于这种辉煌成就估计不足，夸大工作中的缺点，就会挫伤广大群众和干部的积极性，对社会主义事业就不是促进，而是促退。
    1955年冬季以来，三个年头，三个冬春，从农业生产方面看，1956年冬和1957年春，由于反对所谓“冒进”的一阵风，使广大群众和干部松劲泄气，兴修水利和积肥不仅比不上去冬今春，也比不上1955年冬季开始的第一个高潮；1957年的复种指数、水稻、薯类和玉米等高产作物的播种面积也是不如1956年，比今年差的更多。结果1956年在严重自然灾害的条件下，粮食仍然增产较多，1957年自然条件并不比1956年坏，而粮食增产很少。三年的形势是两头高、中间低。这充分证明：坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的路线，按照毛泽东同志在农村社会主义高潮的序言中即已指出的，着重批判和克服社会主义建设速度方面的右倾保守思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，就会掀起几亿劳动群众的生产热潮，生产大跃进，各项社会主义建设事业大跃进；反之，离开了多快好省地建设社会主义的路线，把跃进当做“冒进”，反对所谓“冒进”，生产和其他各项社会主义建设事业就发展迟缓，停滞不前。
    在1956年下半年和1957年春，遇到“反冒进”风浪的时候，在农业战线上，有些地方坚持住了，受这种风浪的影响比较小；而有些地方，有些同志则表现摇摆，思想模糊起来，有埋怨情绪，缺乏斗争勇气。我们应当从此吸取深刻的教训。
　　（二）
    要生产跃进，首先就要思想上敢于跃进。几年来，运动的一反一复，在农业战线的一些干部的思想中有些问题纠缠不清，思想受到束缚。其中，带根本性的问题是两个，一个是充分估计合作农民的积极性和创造性，一个是对待富裕中农的问题，前者是关于社会主义建设速度的问题，后者是关于两条道路斗争的问题。需要把这些纠缠不清的思想观点摆清楚，解放思想，以便真正做到敢想、敢说、敢做，从而推动生产大跃进。
    不能用过时的衡量个体农民的尺度来衡量合作农民
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“要尊重唯物论、辩证法。人们的思想应该正确地反映客观实际。”“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的客观情况。”客观实际是经常变化，不断发展的，人们的思想也不能停滞不前，不能用老眼光来看新事物。完成了农业合作化，在生产资料所有制方面基本实现了社会主义改造，又经过思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，农民已经发生了有史以来的根本变化。许多在个体经济时代不敢想不能做的事，在农业高潮中已经成为千千万万合作农民的实际行动。但是，有些同志由于思想落后于实际，还是拿多少年来在脑子里面印象很深的个体农民的尺度来衡量已经获得大解放的、生龙活虎一样的合作农民，并且认为不能“割断历史”，认为农民这也不能接受，那也不能接受，这就把许许多多客观上本来可以办到的事情，或者是经过努力可以办到的事情，认为是办不到的，也不去办；结果是墨守成规，保守主义。
    保守思想是脱离实际的主观主义
    人们的思想不能适应客观情况的发展，对于客观情况估计不足，把经过努力本来可以做到的事情认为做不到，不去做。这种右倾保守思想，和那种超越客观情况许可的条件勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情一样，都是脱离实际的，主观主义的。历史证明，两者都会给人民的革命事业带来损失。几年来的事实并且证明，由于社会主义建设高潮中的个别缺点而带来的损失，同由于右倾保守、能办到的事也不去办而带来的损失比较起来，前者要小得多，后者要大得多。但是，有些同志由于思想上的一种习惯性、惰性，往往把“右倾保守、安于现状”同“从实际出发”混淆起来，仿佛右倾保守并没有脱离实际。其实，客观实际是要求前进的，前进的“幼芽”已经在实际中茁长出来了，右倾保守、安于现状就是把前进的“幼芽”压抑下去，这显然是脱离实际的主观主义。前进当中，出点毛病，带来某些损失，是比较容易一眼看到的。由于保守思想，许多能办到的事没有办而带来的损失，则往往容易被忽略过去而不自觉。为了推动当前的高潮更向前进，尤其需要在这方面提高警觉。
    尾巴主义同强迫命令都是违反群众路线的
    群众路线是我们党的优良的传统作风，在革命时期要群众路线，在建设时期同样要群众路线。农业和农村工作的对象是几亿农民，量大面广，更必须坚决按照群众路线办事。群众路线，就是党走群众路线，领导群众前进，领导群众革命。群众在任何时候，在任何事物面前，总是有先进的、中间的和落后的三种不同的态度。关键是争取处于中间状态的群众，这往往是群众中的多数。不顾群众觉悟程度、特别是中间群众的觉悟程度，而采取强迫命令的做法，结果脱离群众，这当然是违反群众路线的，当然应该反对。反之，跟着落后的群众跑，把落后群众的意见当做全体群众的意见，结果不是教育落后的向先进的看齐，领导群众前进，而是要先进的向落后的看齐，安于现状，保持落后，这种尾巴主义同群众的利益是不一致的，有时候表面看来似乎符合群众的目前利益和局部利益，然而同群众的长远利益和根本利益还是不一致的，所以实质上也是脱离群众的，也是违反群众路线的，也必须反对。湖北襄阳专区均县李家湾的支部书记李大贵同志，正是因为当初没有按照群众中落后分子的意见办事，不顾那些落后分子甚至他自己的父亲和妻子的反对，而团结一些积极分子，钻研试验，终于实现了引水灌溉，改变了李家湾多少辈子以来的干旱穷困的面貌，并且推动了全襄阳专区的水利高潮。湖北谷城县三合社二十二岁的女主任朱国蕴和老技术员陈道银的斗争，广东汕头专区在实行土地大平整中从干部到群众的思想斗争，他们解决问题的过程都是走群众路线领导群众前进的榜样。在当前的农业新高潮中，这类事例多得很。我们应该从这些动人的事例中去学习，学会既不强迫命令，又不犯尾巴主义的错误，正确地按照党的群众路线的传统作风办事。
    做自然界的奴隶，还是做自然界的主人
    要增加农作物产量，就要同自然界做斗争。在社会斗争中，有安于现状和改造现状两种不同思想，同样，在当前的向自然界做斗争中，也存在着屈服于自然和改造自然两种不同的思想。改造自然，一定会遇到许许多多大大小小的困难。只有大胆试验，大胆创造，不怕困难，不怕失败；出了毛病，还要不怕责难，而是分析原因，找出缺点，再接再厉，这样才能一步步地改造自然，做自然界的主人。安徽省的三改、天津地区的洼改、河南济源县的漭河治理等等，就是这样取得成功的。我们应该向这些先进的事例学习，反对那种不敢创造，不敢试验，害怕困难，害怕失败，在恶劣的自然条件面前认懦服输的思想，更要反对那种挑剔责难、泼冷水的态度。因为，这种思想和态度的结局，只能使人们屈服于自然，做自然界的奴隶。当然，改造自然，也要利用自然现象的普遍规律，来达到改造的目的。譬如水的规律是从高处往低处流，人们要用水来浇灌干旱的山地，改变山区的干旱的自然面貌，那么就打个坝，使水位升高起来，或者从远处更高的有水源的地方开一条渠把水引过来。这就是利用自然规律来改造自然。我国的农业生产目前仍然在很大的程度上受自然界的支配。但是，我们必须有决心，有信心，有毅力，向自然界做斗争，改造自然，使之为人类服务。
    推广先进的增产经验和因地制宜
    先进的增产经验，必须经过试验、积极推广。这应该首先肯定。肯定了这一条，就来了“因地制宜”还是
  “机械照搬”的问题。推广先进经验同因地制宜并不是对立的。因地制宜，是讲推广先进经验的时候要因地制宜，反对照搬。离开了推广先进经验，只是按当地原有的老经验老习惯办，那根本就不发生因地制宜的问题。过去几年中，有这样一种现象，就是：劲头来了就强调推广先进经验，不大讲因地制宜；泄了劲就强调因地制宜，而且越强调越过分，强调得仿佛先进经验都不能推广了。这一点也要在干部思想上弄清楚。
    “万无一失”和“难免”
    党中央和毛泽东同志指示我们，“充分发动群众，一切经过试验。”我们在推广良种、推广新式农具和推广合理密植、及时早播等一切先进的增产措施的时候，都要按照这个指示办。同时，在进行试验的时候，应该大胆试验，不怕失败。要试验的事，本来就是没有一定把握成功的事，怎么能完全免于失败呢？世界上一切的创造发明，在试验过程中，都是经过多少次失败，最后才得到成功的。在试验成功后积极推广的时候，应该力求减少损失，以致避免损失。但是，万无一失也是不可能的。特别是就农业生产方面讲，因为条件太复杂，变化太多，经过试验成功的事第二年在另一块条件大体相同的土地上去推行，还不一定完全有把握。少数的损失总是难免的。难免论是正确的。不仅农业技术工作如此，各项工作也大都如此。不能用万无一失做标准，来衡量工作的成败。对于工作中难以完全避免的缺点，应该采取积极的态度，帮助研究，找出克服的办法。这才有利于保护广大群众和干部的积极性，是鼓劲而不是泄劲，做促进派而不做促退派。
    正确对待富裕中农
    上面讲的主要是关于社会主义建设速度方面的一些思想问题。富裕中农问题则是有关农村中两条道路斗争的问题。
    富裕中农是农民的一部分，又是农村中的上层小资产阶级。他们在社会主义革命中所处的地位，和在民主革命中不同。一部分资本主义自发倾向比较严重的富裕中农，在农业合作化过程中是抵抗合作化，被迫入社以后，就想在社内搞资本主义，并且一有机会就闹，想退社单干，甚至想把合作社闹垮。这一部分富裕中农，在农村两条道路的斗争中，公开挂帅，代表资本主义道路。因为，富农已经跟地主一起在土改中被打垮了，经济上垮了，政治上臭了。而这一部分富裕中农是有本钱的，所以他们就成了公开挂帅的。这是我国农村的一个特点。农村中两条道路的斗争并没有结束，在整个过渡时期中，这还是主要的矛盾。但是，富裕中农又是农民的一部分，所以这个矛盾主要表现为人民内部矛盾，必须采取处理人民内部矛盾的方法来处理，要用说服的办法，而不能用压服的办法，加强社会主义的思想工作，批判他们的资本主义自发的思想和行为。只有这样，经过斗争，才能达到团结改造他们的目的。反之，放松对他们的思想斗争，在经济上采取对他们迁就退让的政策，不仅不能达到团结改造他们的目的，而且会削弱社会主义在农村中的阵地。在1956年冬和1957年春农村中反社会主义分子活动最嚣张的时候，有的地方就有过这种教训。现在，这种斗争并没有结束，我们还要注意防止农业合作社内资本主义因素的滋长，也要估计到一部分富裕中农一有机会还会闹事。所以，还要在干部思想上把这个问题摆清楚。
    从农业战线干部思想的情况看，把这些纠缠不清的问题摆清楚，对于解放思想，是有好处的。

    从去年冬季开始的农业生产新高潮，已经在兴修水利、改造洼地、水土保持、积肥造肥、改良土壤和植树造林等农田基本建设方面，创造出惊人的成绩，不仅是1957年所不能比拟的，而且大大超过高潮下的1956年。这个运动一开始，就是搞农田水利等基本建设，改变农业生产条件，向自然界进军，这是当前农业生产高潮的一个显著的特点。这个高潮的特点还表现在规模大、劲头足、进度快、质量好、创造多、内容全面，并且一般说来是，干得多，讲得少，指标先进，措施具体，领导深入，检查评比及时，工农业互相促进，城乡互相促进。
    随着春耕播种和麦收季节的到来，运动的中心已经由农田基本建设方面转到田间生产方面。今年的夏收作物比以往任何一年好，油菜籽预计比去年增产一千万担，冬小麦也获得突破以往增长比例的大丰收，这是农业新高潮在增加农作物产量方面显示出来的第一个大胜利。此外，按各省规划，今年的复种指数将由139.5％增加到144.8％，比去年增加5.3％，其中，稻谷、薯类、玉米等高产作物的播种面积将比去年增加近两亿亩；九千万亩棉花的播种工作已经完成，其中有灌溉设施的棉田比去年增加两千万亩，用岱字棉良种的棉田比去年增加一千七百万亩；加上水利、积肥和改良农具已经取得的成就，选用良种、合理密植和及时早播等等增产措施的广泛推行，各省所规划的增产指标，确实是有数字根据的。只要我们充分发挥几亿农民的革命干劲，把群众的集体主义和共产主义精神更广泛地发扬起来，把高潮继续推向前进，今年的农业增产，一定会打破常规的增长比例，大大超过国家计划。
    去冬以来，畜牧工作也有显著的好转，耕畜不正常的死亡现象已经基本停止，膘也比往年长得好，耕畜配种运动已经在许多地方展开。第一季度的养猪头数已达一亿六千多万头，已经超过今年的国家计划指标。现在的问题是种畜供应和兽疫防治工作跟不上，这是我们工作中的缺点，必须积极改进。今年配的种，下的幼畜，两三年内还用不上，因此，绝不能乐观，还须加紧努力。
    全国农业发展纲要所规定的粮食亩产“四、五、八”的指标，1957年已经有六十五个县（市）达到或者超过了；棉花亩产六十斤、八十斤、一百斤皮棉的指标，1957年已经有六十四个县（市）达到或者超过了。按照各省规划，今年将有好几百个县（市）分别达到上述指标。明年后年达到上述增产指标的县（市）无疑将越来越多。毛泽东同志指示，从现在起，要大发展油料，要把油料作物提高到和粮食、棉花一样的位置。各地增产油料的劲头也大大高涨起来。按照各省、市、自治区的规划，把可能遇到的大水、大旱估计在内，争取在第二个五年计划或者稍多一两年的时间内，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，具有完全现实的可能性。全国农业发展纲要规定的单位产量指标同资本主义国家的最高水平相比较，有些作物的单位产量已经赶上或者超过，有些作物在实现全国农业发展纲要的基础上，再增加一倍左右就可以赶上或者超过。我们完全有信心，在十五年内，不仅使我国农产品的产量，而且使各种主要农作物的单位产量都赶上和超过资本主义国家，应该说是能够做到的。
    超额完成1958年的农业增产计划，提前实现四十条纲要，十五年使我国农产品的产量和主要农作物的单位面积产量赶上和超过资本主义国家，这就是在农业战线上贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的具体任务。
　　（四）
    为了贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，必须适应高潮的形势和生产大跃进的要求，来改进我们的工作。这里讲三点，抓思想，抓措施，抓技术革命。
    第一，抓思想。“思想是灵魂，政治是统帅。”加强农村中的社会主义思想政治工作，保证高潮继续前进的旺盛士气。同时，也要不断提高我们自己的思想，深入生产大跃进的群众运动中去，使我们自己的思想能够适应客观情况的发展，防止和克服保守思想的滋长。学习毛泽东同志的思想作风，学习毛泽东同志的著作和工作方法六十条，学习毛泽东同志把唯物论、辩证法运用到实际工作中去。并且结合尚未结束的整风运动，来进一步检查我们的工作，更深刻地揭发我们工作中的官僚主义、主观主义（无论是来自教条主义或者经验主义的）的错误，从而使我们的思想更提高一步。
    第二，在增产措施方面，抓水利、肥料、土壤、种子，以改善农业生产条件，抓以合理密植和加强田间管理为中心的综合性的增产技术措施。农业部正在按照全国农业发展纲要和毛泽东同志“工作方法六十条”所提出的制定农业十四项规划的要求，逐条逐项地拟定规划。当前在水利方面，要在扩大灌溉面积的同时，加强灌溉管理，改进灌溉方法，合理用水。在肥料方面，不仅努力增加数量，还要注意提高质量，改进造肥贮肥和施肥方法，提高肥效。在合理密植方面和其他各项增产措施方面，新的先进经验不断涌现，要善于运用现场会议、参观评比的方式及时总结推广，改进我们过去在这方面抓得不具体不及时的缺点。平整土地、合理利用土地，是生产跃进所必需，还可以扩大耕地面积，普遍提倡实行起来，全国至少可以增加耕地几千万亩到一亿亩，这是大有可为的。
    第三，抓技术革命。通过当前的改良农具运动，逐步实现半机械化和机械化。我们在农业机械化问题上，长期是有迷信的。靠大工业，靠国家大量投资。这也是搬来的。现在这种迷信破除了。从当前群众改良农具的热潮、农业社增加公共积累的积极性和各地发展地方工业的积极性看来，在不久的将来就会在农村中出现一个技术革命的高潮，随着我国社会主义工业化的发展，我国农业技术装备的落后状态，无疑地将以比较快的速度得到根本的改变，实现农业机械化。
    我们有许多同志在农业科学技术问题上，也是有迷信的，把它看得很神秘，仿佛是“高不可攀”，也不去好好学习，这是很不对的。我们要下决心努力学习农业科学技术，种试验田，向又红又专的方向努力。
    为了在农业大跃进中发挥科学技术人员的力量，也为了进一步改造他们的思想，最近从农业部、中国农业科学院和北京农业大学组织了二百五十人左右的技术队伍到农村去，这不仅在农业生产前线上增加了技术力量，而且使他们在农民群众实践中得到教育。
    这样，上下结合，干部、科学技术人员同群众结合，科学技术同农民的生产实践结合，就可以进一步推动改进耕作技术的热潮，促进农业的技术革命，多快好省地把现代化的社会主义的农业建设起来。
