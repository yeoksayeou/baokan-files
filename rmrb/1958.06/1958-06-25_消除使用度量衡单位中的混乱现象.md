    Eliminate Confusion in the Use of Weights and Measures

    Currently, many newspapers and periodicals in our country have not unified the usage of weights and measures, causing a lot of trouble for readers. For example, regarding the unit of length "公厘" (gongli), some call it "毫米" (haomi), some call it "粍" (zhe), and sometimes it is mistakenly called "米厘" (mili). Sometimes, the metric system and the Chinese system are mixed. In the "Bark Turns into Cotton, Rice Straw Spun into Yarn" column on the first page of the People's Daily on March 16, it was mentioned that the man-made cotton produced in Zunyi County has "fibers as long as one cun two to one cun five," and then in the same report, it was also mentioned that "the cotton fibers in Zunyi Prefecture are only nine gongli." How much longer is one cun two compared to nine gongli? I am afraid that only readers with a cultural level above junior high school can calculate it. In addition, the use of mu and hectares concurrently, and milligrams and liang concurrently, are also very common.

    It is suggested that all national newspapers and periodicals unify the units of measurement, which would greatly benefit readers.			   Zhang Hongzhi

    消除使用度量衡单位中的混乱现象
    现在我国很多报刊对于度量衡单位的用法未能统一，给读者带来不少麻烦。例如尺度方面的“公厘”，有的叫“毫米”，有的叫“粍”，有时错误地把它叫作“米厘”。有时更把公制单位与市制单位混用。3月16日人民日报一版“树皮变棉花，稻草纺成纱”专栏中，提到遵义县的人造棉“纤维长达一寸二至一寸五”，紧接着在同一报道中又提到“而遵义专区的棉花纤维只有九公厘”。究竟一寸二比九公厘长多少？恐怕非中学以上文化程度的读者，不能计算出来。此外，亩与公顷并用，毫克与两并用的情况均甚常见。
    建议全国报刊都把度量衡单位统一起来，这样会给读者很大便利。			   张鸿志
