The Zhaiquan Cooperative Society Ushers in a Magnificent Cultural Revolution: A New Type of Agricultural University with a Unique Style is Born in Henan

    (Our correspondent Chen Jian reports) Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialism, the masses of the Zhaiquan Agricultural Cooperative Society in Pingle Township, Mengjin County, Henan Province, have liberated their minds and boldly broken through all superstitions and conventions, using their own strength to create a new type of agricultural university with a unique style. This school has only been open for three months, but it has already achieved very outstanding results. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to their experience and is preparing to vigorously promote it throughout the province.

    This school has a total of 559 students, and according to the specialties and interests of all the students, it has set up seventeen departments: agriculture, industry, forestry, machinery, science, animal husbandry, pest and disease control, economics, political education, agricultural meteorology, water conservancy survey, medicine, art, Chinese language, Russian, welfare, and physical education. The method of separating departments for learning technology, separating classes for learning culture, and unifying for learning politics is adopted to make scientific research and cultural and political studies complement each other. The characteristic of their learning is the close integration of education and production. In the classroom, they learn book knowledge to master theory; in the fields, they use crops as teaching materials for on-site operation and experimentation. The purpose of running this school is to enable all ordinary cooperative members to master general cultural and scientific knowledge within two or three years, and to become proficient in a technology in their chosen department to serve agricultural production. Because this school is run by the masses themselves, the learning methods are correct, and the purpose is very clear, it has achieved great results in just three months. The machinery department has trained twenty-five boiler engine and diesel engine operators. The industrial department has created and improved hundreds of agricultural tools such as automatic soil transporters, hand-operated powder sprayers, and disc harrows. Each tool can increase production efficiency several times. The animal husbandry department has carried out disease prevention and control for livestock and poultry throughout the cooperative society and adopted scientific feeding methods. The art department trains its own writers, directors, singers, and actors. In a few months, they created tens of thousands of clappers, poems, and scripts. But the biggest achievement is that this school has implemented scientific management methods for the cooperative's wheat fields, achieving five irrigations and five fertilizations, timely detection and elimination of various pests and diseases, and a large amount of topdressing of manure containing potassium to prevent wheat lodging. Therefore, the average yield of wheat in the cooperative this year is 720 jin per mu, equivalent to more than three times last year. The experimental fields of the agriculture department yield 1,440 jin per mu, reaching a high yield that the cooperative has never had in its history; currently, the agriculture department is cultivating high-yield fields with 2,000 jin of ginned cotton and 300,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. The science department has successfully tested a bacterial fertilizer. The industrial department has also successfully trial-produced a wooden car, which can increase the cooperative's transportation efficiency several times.

    One of the important reasons why this school can be run so well is that the masses dare to think, dare to act, and dare to do; this is true communist style. For example, to solve the difficulty of the school lacking teachers, in addition to inviting a cadre sent to work at a lower level and a university student to serve as teachers, they also adopted the method of taking materials locally, those who can do more work more, those who are excellent serve as teachers, strengthening research, and learning from each other. They emphasize that based on personal production experience, combined with book knowledge, they boldly study, boldly imagine, and boldly explore. They require every student to eliminate inferiority complex, open the mysterious door of science and technology, and become the master of science and culture. The three teachers in the machinery department are high school graduates who have attended mechanical training classes, plus twenty-five young farmers, which is the entire staff of the machinery department. However, they study day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, and in less than two months, the twenty-five students have mastered several mechanical operation techniques. The students in the agriculture department, after learning about the properties and uses of various fertilizers, discovered that the wheat leaves of dozens of mu of wheat were curled and the wheat stems were weak. They knew that this was due to a lack of potassium fertilizer, so they supplemented it in time.

    Walking into this cooperative society, one immediately gets a new feeling, making people feel the storm of the cultural and technological revolution. Everywhere here are experimental fields, everywhere are research rooms. Cooperative members from twenty to fifty years old each carry a "cultural and scientific leap forward bag" with them at all times, containing books, ready to study and research at any time. The students of the whole school have developed the habit of buying books and visiting bookstores. The cooperative library, which has 15,000 books, is often crowded with students reading and borrowing books. Based on their own production experience, combined with book principles, they study hard, showing an urgent need for culture and technology. The CCP branch of this cooperative society boldly and actively led this earth-shaking cultural and technological revolution. After the whole cooperative society announced that it was free of illiteracy in February this year, the branch immediately supported the cooperative members in creating this school and promptly changed its working methods, carrying out its work through the cooperative's technical leadership institution - the Scientific Research Institute. The Party branch committee timely studies and discusses the production and study plans, inventions, and typical experiences of each department, and actively leads the political study of each department.

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party praised the originality of this school and attached great importance to its teaching experience. It believes that it has created a unified form that combines cultural learning and technical learning; it has used the communist education method of combining education and production; it has initially found a practical and feasible way to train farmers to become experts. At present, the provincial party committee is holding an on-site meeting of key literacy counties in the province in this cooperative, preparing to vigorously promote the experience of this cooperative throughout the province.

    翟泉社兴起雄伟的文化革命
    河南一所独具风格的新型农业大学诞生
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：在社会主义总路线光辉照耀下，河南省孟津县平乐乡翟泉农业社的群众，解放了思想，大胆地打破了一切迷信和常规，用自己的力量，创建一所独具风格的新型农业大学。这所学校开办只有三个月，已经取得了十分优异的成绩，中共河南省委会非常重视他们的经验，准备在全省范围内大力推广。
    这所学校共有学生五百五十九人，根据全体学员的特长和爱好，分设了农业、工业、林业、机械、科学、牧畜、病虫害防治、经济、政教、农业气象、水利勘察、医学、艺术、语文、俄文、福利、体育十七个系。采取了分系学技术，分班学文化，统一学政治的办法，使科学研究和文化政治学习相辅进行。他们的学习特点是教育和生产密切结合。在课堂内，学习书本知识掌握理论；到田间以作物为教材，进行实地操作试验。办这所学校的目的是在两三年内，使全体普通社员能掌握一般的文化科学知识，并在自己的选系中精通一门技术，为农业生产服务。由于这所学校是群众自办，学习方法对头，目的十分明确，因此仅三个月的时间，就取得很大的成绩。机械系培养了二十五名锅驼机和柴油机手。工业系创造和改良了自动运土器、手摇喷粉车、圆盘耙等几百种农业工具。每种工具都能提高生产效率好几倍。牧畜系对全社的牲畜和家禽进行了病害防治，并采用了科学的饲养方法。艺术系培养自己的作家、导演、歌手和演员。他们几个月创作了几万个快板、诗歌和剧本。但最大的成绩是这所学校对全社的麦田实行了科学的管理方法，作到了五水五肥，及时发现和消灭了各种病虫害，大量地追上含有钾素的粪肥，防止了小麦的倒伏。因此，今年全社小麦平均亩产七百二十斤，相当于去年的三倍多。农业系的试验田每亩产一千四百四十斤，达到这个社历史上从未有过的高额丰产；目前农业系正在培植亩产二千斤皮棉和亩产三十万斤红薯的高额丰产田。科学系试验成功了一种细菌肥料。工业系还试制成功了一辆木质汽车，可使全社的运输效率提高好几倍。
    这个学校所以能办得这样出色，重要原因之一是群众敢想，敢作，敢为；这是真正的共产主义风格。例如他们解决学校缺乏师资的困难，除请一名下放干部和一个大学生担任教师外，还采取就地取材，能者多劳，优者为师，加强研究，互相学习的办法。他们强调根据个人的生产经验，结合书本知识，大胆地钻研，大胆地设想，大胆地探讨。要求每一个学员去掉自卑感，打开科学技术的神秘大门，作科学文化的主人。机械系的三名教员是上过机械训练班的高中毕业生，加上二十五名青年农民，这就是机械系的全部人员了。可是他们不分昼夜，废寝忘食地钻研，二十五名学生不到两个月，就掌握了几种机械操作技术。农业系的学员，学习了各种肥料的性能和用途后，发觉有几十亩麦子的麦叶卷缩，麦茎细弱，他们知道这是缺乏钾肥所致，就及时补上。
    走进这个社，立即给人一种崭新的感觉，使人感到了文化技术革命的风暴。这里到处是试验田，到处是研究室。从二十岁到五十岁的社员，每人都随时带着一个“文化科学跃进袋”，里面装着书籍，准备随时学习和研究。全校的学员都养成了买书和逛书店的习惯。拥有一万五千册书的社图书馆，经常挤满了阅读和借书的学员。他们都根据自己的生产经验，结合着书本原理，苦钻苦学，表现了对文化技术的迫切要求。这个社的中共支部，大胆积极地领导了这翻天复地的文化技术革命。今年2月全社宣布为无盲社以后，支部马上支持社员创建了这所学校，并及时地改变了自己的工作方法，通过社的技术领导机构——科学研究所，来开展自己的工作。党的支委会及时地研究讨论各系的生产学习计划、创造发明、典型经验，并积极地领导各系的政治学习。
    中共河南省委会对这所学校的独创精神，进行了表扬，并十分重视它的教学经验。认为它创造了文化学习和技术学习相结合的统一形式；运用了教育和生产相结合的共产主义的教育方法；初步找到了培养农民成为专家的切实可行的途径。目前省委正在这个社召开全省扫盲重点县的现场会议，准备在全省范围内大力推广这个社的经验。
