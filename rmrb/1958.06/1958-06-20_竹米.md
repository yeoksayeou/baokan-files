    In the Pinggou Township area of Lueyang County, Shaanxi Province, in the deep mountains, there is a kind of bamboo that grows ears with grains like wheat, which local farmers call bamboo rice. Its nutritional content is very good, and the flour is similar to wheat flour, and can be used to make noodles and steam buns.

    Each bamboo plant has ten to twenty ears, and each ear has about twelve grains of rice. The shape of bamboo rice is very similar to oats, and the maturity period is the same as that of wheat crops. Recently, the Guozhen District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Lueyang County conducted a survey and appraisal in this area and considered it to be a delicious food, with an annual output of more than 16,000 jin.

    竹米
    陕西省略阳县平沟乡一带的大山上，有一种竹子上长着有麦粒的穗子，当地农民叫做竹米。它的营养成分很好，面粉同麦面相似，可以捍做面条，蒸馒头。
    每株竹上有十个到二十个穗子，每穗有米粒十二颗左右。竹米的外形很像燕麦，成熟期与麦类作物相同。最近，略阳县郭镇区供销社曾在这个地方作了勘察和鉴定，认为是一种好吃的食粮，年产一万六千多斤。　（新华社）
