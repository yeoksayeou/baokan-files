    Sweeping Away Old Rules and Breaking Superstitions with an Impressive Spirit
    Advancing Towards the Highest Scientific Level in the World
    Leap Forward Conference Held by Research Units in the Beijing Area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    (Our reporter Zhou Lifang reports) Responding to the call of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, research units in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a Leap Forward Conference on June 3rd and 5th, solemnly vowing to launch a great march towards the world's scientific peaks with an overwhelming momentum.

    More than 1,800 people attended the conference, including academicians in Beijing, staff from various units in Beijing, and heads of units from other places. The targets proposed by various units at this conference were significantly higher than those proposed at the Leap Forward Conference of various departments not long ago. Under the mutual challenges, competitive promotion, and enlightenment, the targets of many units at the conference leaped forward again and again.

    Among the leap forward plans proposed at this conference, particularly exciting and encouraging were the ambitious goals of several research units.

    The Institute of Automation is currently conducting research on the automatic control of the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Hub and automated industrial production. The Institute of Automation guarantees that within five years, in close collaboration with other departments, it will solve the main technical problems of the comprehensive automation of the Three Gorges. In terms of automated industrial production, they plan to develop a set of the most innovative instruments and standardized and serialized automation technology tools. Under the major premise of facing production, they will vigorously assist key industrial sectors in solving the problem of production automatic control, and plan to cooperate with the Yumen Oil Mine to develop a "self-optimizing drilling equipment," plus other improved operational measures to increase the monthly drilling footage by 30%.

    The great cause of socialist construction requires that astronomical research also catch up rapidly. The comrades of the Beijing Observatory Preparatory Office proposed to build the Shahe Town Time Service Station, and cooperate with the Bureau of Metrology and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to issue the most advanced standard frequencies and new time signals.

    China is rich in all important elements. In order to find them and serve socialist construction, the researchers of the Institute of Geology are determined to complete the research on 34 rare elements, originally scheduled to take ten years, ahead of schedule. They also proposed at the meeting the goal of catching up with the world's advanced level in petroleum geology research.

    In response to the nationwide leap forward in water conservancy work, the Institute of Water Conservancy Research will provide the necessary data and methods for hydrological calculations of small rivers in the shortest possible time, so that wherever there is a water conservancy project, there will be hydrological data and methods. In terms of irrigation mechanization, it will complete an easy-to-promote short-range bamboo and wood sprinkler (ten meters) and a medium-range (forty meters) sprinkler within this year. Secondly, it will serve large-scale water conservancy hubs such as the Three Gorges and Sanmenxia, and cooperate with relevant departments to solve extremely complex sediment problems. In order to cooperate with the construction of water conservancy projects such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the Elastic Mechanics Group of the Institute of Mechanics has decided to catch up with the world's most advanced countries in the study of seismic resistance of dams in the near future.

    In order to promote the leap forward development of agricultural production, the researchers of the Department of Biology proposed leap forward targets aimed at the current urgent problems.

    Biogas is a source of power that is being prepared for large-scale promotion in rural areas of China. However, the problem of biogas fermentation has not yet been completely solved. The Beijing Institute of Microbiology proposed to cooperate with relevant units to propose effective solutions to the fermentation of biogas, both in terms of gas production and stability. And before July 1, 1960, they will cultivate low-temperature biogas fermentation bacteria so that the fermentation bacteria can vigorously produce biogas even in winter. In the research of Rhizopus, Monascus and other application bacteria unique to China, they can reach a considerable level in 1960. As for the research of Penicillium, Aspergillus, Actinomycetes, and putrefactive microorganisms, they must also obtain relatively high-level results within a certain period of time. In addition, the Institute of Microbiology will also make effective achievements in the method of using microorganisms to explore for petroleum and metal mineral deposits within a few years, and gradually promote it.

    In addition to the goals proposed at the Leap Forward Conference of the Department, the Institute of Entomology has newly added several targets this time: complete the research on the endosorption and insecticide effect of 666 rice one year ahead of schedule; complete the investigation of the national grain insect area in two years, one year ahead of schedule; and immediately propose a comprehensive prevention and control plan for cotton insects.

    Botanists are determined to complete the following targets within three years in research closely related to agricultural production: formulate a sand fixation plan to prevent the southward movement of the desert and protect farmland; propose a plan to turn barren deserts into fertile fields; increase the yield of pasture in grassland areas by three to ten times; and propose a plan to rationally build mountain waist forest belts and utilize melting snow.

    The new plan put forward by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology is a good example of scientists working hard and striving for the top. Before the rectification campaign, they planned that the research of Chinese paleoanthropology would take twenty years to reach a relatively high level. At the Leap Forward Conference of the Department, this number was changed to ten years. Now their goal is to surpass capitalist countries in a shorter period of time.

    Under the socialist system, people can consider the issue of extending life expectancy. Based on this idea, the experts of the Animal Morphology Group of the Institute of Zoology decided to vigorously study the regeneration and aging of organs and tissues, as well as the relationship between the nervous system and endocrine organs, to meet mankind's desire to extend life expectancy.

    Although this conference was held immediately after the Leap Forward Conference of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, the targets proposed by various philosophical and social science research units have been greatly improved. Some units have proposed that the number of words in the five-year plan reaches more than 100 million. The ambition of the Institute of Philosophy is more than 90 million words in six categories of works, including treatises on the study of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought.

    While various research units were vying to propose leap forward plans, the first good news has been frequently reported. The young researchers of the Institute of Geology happily reported to the conference that after the recent leap forward, the Central Analysis Room has shortened the analysis time of each rock sample from nine days in the past to one day now.

    The young staff of the Institute of Chemistry took 13 days and nights to extract the eleven rare earth elements that have always been considered mysterious, and the spectral purity generally reached the international level. Among them, the spectral purity of erbium exceeded the products of the famous British Johnson factory. They dedicated this leap forward fruit to the conference, and asked the conference to forward another copy to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    During the conference, the researchers of the Institute of Applied Physics and the factory workers fought hard for a day and made 65 MHz, 100 milliwatt high-frequency transistors, length gauges, low-dislocation germanium single crystals, antimony with a purity of five nines, and other things that reached the international level, which they had never dared to think of in the past or thought would take several years to make. Due to the rush to get out the ruby furnace, the plan to make rubies has greatly leapt forward.

    The spirit of communist collaboration is one of the characteristics of this conference. Various research units have actively proposed to support brother units, and have also frankly put forward their own requirements.

    The scientists unanimously pointed out at the meeting that they dared to say and dare to do from not daring to think, and have the confidence to realize an unprecedented leap forward, mainly because under the leadership of the Party, they have clarified the principle of putting politics in command, liberated their minds, and eliminated superstitions. They expressed that they would plant red flags all over the field of scientific research and sweep away all kinds of gray and white flags.

    The conference vividly and powerfully proved that: encouraged by the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, promoted by the nationwide great leap forward situation, and guided by the general line of socialist construction, Chinese scientific workers are breaking superstitions and sweeping away old rules with such an impressive spirit, and are advancing towards the highest scientific level in the world at an accelerated pace.

    以磅礴的气概扫荡陈规破除迷信
    向世界科学最高水平挺进
    中国科学院北京地区各研究单位举行跃进大会
    本报讯　记者周立方报道：中国科学院北京地区各研究单位，响应党的八大二次会议的号召，6月3日和5日举行跃进大会，庄严誓师，以排山倒海之势发起向世界科学高峰的大进军。
    参加这次大会的有在京学部委员，北京各单位工作人员，外地单位负责人等共一千八百多人。各单位在这次大会上提出的指标比不久前在各学部跃进会上提出的指标有了显著提高，而在互相挑战、竞赛推动、启发下，许多单位的指标在会上又一再跃进。
    这次大会上提出的跃进规划中，特别令人兴奋鼓舞的是若干研究单位的宏伟目标。
    自动化研究所目前正环绕着长江三峡水利枢纽的自动控制和自动化工业生产进行着研究工作。自动化研究所保证在五年之内，和其他部门密切协作，解决三峡综合自动化的主要技术问题。在自动化工业生产方面：他们准备搞出一套最新颖的仪表和自动化技术工具的标准化和系列化。在面向生产的大前提下，大力协助各重点工业部门解决生产自动控制问题，计划与玉门油矿合作制出一台“自找最优点的钻井设备”，加上其他改进的操作措施提高钻井月进尺30％。
    伟大的社会主义建设事业要求天文研究事业也迅速地赶上去。北京天文台筹备处的同志们提出了筹建成沙河镇授时台，和计量局、邮电部合作发出最先进的标准频率和新型时号。
    我国富有一切重要元素，为了把它们找出来为社会主义建设服务，地质研究所的研究人员决心把原定十年完成的对三十四种稀有元素的研究提前完成。他们还在会上提出要在石油地质的研究上赶上世界先进水平的目标。
    针对着全国水利工作大跃进，水利科学研究院要在最短期间提出小河流水文计算必需的资料和方法，做到哪里有水利工程，哪里就有水文资料和方法。在灌溉机械化方面，今年以内完成便于推广的短程竹木喷灌器（十公尺）和完成中程（四十公尺）的喷灌器。其次，为三峡、三门峡等大型水利枢纽服务，配合有关部门解决极其复杂的泥沙问题。为配合黄河、长江等水利工程的兴建，力学所弹性力学组决定在水坝抗震的研究上在不久的将来赶上世界最先进的国家。
    为了促进农业生产的飞跃发展，生物学部的研究人员针对着当前的急需问题提出了跃进的指标。
    沼气是我国农村准备大量推广的一种动力来源。但是沼气发酵的问题目前还没有完全解决。北京微生物研究室提出，要与有关单位合作在沼气的发酵方面，不论是发气量还是稳定性，都要提出有效的解决方案。并且要在1960年“七一”以前培育出低温沼气发酵菌类，使发酵菌在冬季也能够旺盛产生沼气。在根霉、红曲霉等我国特有的应用菌类的研究上，在1960年可以达到相当水平，至于在青霉，曲霉，放线菌，霉腐微生物的研究方面，也要在一定时期内得出水平较高的结果。此外，微生物研究室还要在几年内在用微生物勘探石油和金属矿藏的方法方面作出有效成绩，并逐步推广。
    昆虫研究所除在学部跃进会上提出的目标外，这次又新增加了几项指标：提前一年完成六六六水稻内吸作用和杀螟毒效的研究；再提前一年在两年内完成全国粮食昆虫区的调查；立即提出综合防治棉虫的方案。
    植物学家决心在密切结合农业生产的研究上，在三年内完成下列指标：制定固沙方案，防止沙漠南移，保护农田；提出变荒漠为良田的方案；把草原地区牧草产量提高三至十倍；提出合理营造山腰林带的方案，利用融雪。
    古脊椎动物研究所提出的新规划是科学工作者鼓足干劲，力争上游的一个好例子。在整风以前，他们计划中国古人类学的研究要二十年才能达到比较高的水平，在学部跃进会上这个数字改为十年，现在他们的目标是在更短时间内超过资本主义国家。
    在社会主义制度下，人们有可能来考虑延长寿命的问题了。基于这种思想，动物研究所动物形态学组的专家们决定大力研究器官与组织的再生和衰老问题以及神经系统与内分泌器官的关系问题，满足人类延长寿命的愿望。
    这次大会虽然是紧接着哲学社会科学部的跃进大会之后举行的，但是各哲学社会科学的研究单位提出的指标又有飞跃的提高。有些单位提出的五年规划的著作字数达到一亿以上。哲学所的雄心是六类著作共九千多万字，其中包括有关毛主席的哲学思想研究的论著。
    就在各研究单位竞相提出跃进规划的同时，最初的捷报已经纷纷传来。地质研究所的青年研究人员向大会报喜说，中心分析室经过最近的跃进，已经把每个岩石标本分析的时间从过去的九天缩短到现在的一天。
    化学研究所的青年工作人员突击了十三个昼夜，已经把一向认为神秘的十一种稀土元素提取出来，而且光谱纯度一般达到了国际水平。其中铒的光谱纯度超过了英国名牌约翰逊厂的产品。他们把这个跃进果实献给了大会，并且请大会把另外一份转送给党中央和毛主席。
    在大会期间，应用物理研究所的研究人员和工厂工人奋战一天，做出了过去根本不敢想或者认为要几年才能做出来的六十五兆周一百毫瓦的高频晶体管，比长仪，低位错的锗单晶，纯度达五个九的锑等等达到国际水平的东西来。由于把做红宝石的炉子突击了出来，制出红宝石的计划又大为跃进。
    共产主义大协作的精神是这次大会的特点之一。各研究单位纷纷主动提出支援兄弟单位，同时也坦率地提出了自己的要求。
    科学家们在会上一致指出，他们从不敢想到敢说敢做，并且有信心实现空前的跃进，主要是由于在党的领导下，明确了政治挂帅，解放了思想，破除了迷信的缘故。他们表示要在科学研究领域中遍插红旗，把形形色色的灰旗白旗一扫而光。
    大会生动有力地证明了：在党的八大二次会议的精神鼓舞下，在全国大跃进形势推动下，在社会主义建设总路线指导下，我国科学工作者正以何等磅礴的气概，破除迷信，扫荡陈规，向世界科学最高水平兼程挺进。
