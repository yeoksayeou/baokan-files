    The righteous army of socialist thought is relentlessly attacking bourgeois individualism, aiming to discredit it.
    So, has individualism been utterly defeated and surrendered? No, no, it is building defenses step by step, section by section.
    The first line of defense is called "It's Not Happening."
    "You have individualism!"
    "I have individualism? That's simply absurd!"
    When people present the facts of individualism one by one before him, and he can no longer deny it, he retreats to the second line of defense.
    The second line of defense is called "Noble Individualism."
    "Who doesn't have a little individualism? But individualism is also different: one is noble individualism, and the other is vulgar individualism. I belong to noble individualism."
    Individualism is spoken of in relation to collectivism. The ultimate goal of individualism is for oneself, for the individual; to put it bluntly, it is called selfishness. "Noble individualism" is simply individualism that is hidden deeper and decorated more beautifully, not as naked as vulgar individualism. Vulgar individualism is certainly vulgar, but noble individualism is, in the final analysis, still vulgar. Moreover, it is arsenic coated with sugar, which is more likely to deceive people, and its harm is even greater.
    "Earning a living by one's skills" is said to be a type of "noble individualism." Fine, even if you have the skill, the food you eat is not ordinary food, it is fine wine and delicacies, very good food. However, if it is only for eating, then your skills can serve the revolution, or they can serve the counter-revolution; they can serve the Communist Party, or they can serve the Kuomintang. If a person's skills are used to serve the counter-revolution or the Kuomintang, how can that be called "noble"?
    Or you might say that now the people are the masters of the house, and of course, serving is serving the people. Fine, even if you are serving the people, but serving is only a means, and eating well yourself is the ultimate goal. In that case, when the interests of the individual and the interests of the collective conflict, it is very likely that the collective will be sacrificed to benefit the individual. How can this be called "noble"? The so-called "noble" is just a beautified way of saying it.
    There is also a third line of defense, called "Although individualism stinks, it is like stinky tofu, the smell is bad, but it is quite delicious."
    This line of defense is actually not a line of defense at all, almost verging on being shameless. Don't you see when two people are arguing, the losing side uses the method of "embracing it" as a form of resistance?
    "You scold me for being shameless? Then I am shameless!" "You scold me for being bored? Then I am bored!" "You scold me for being stinky? Then I am stinky!"
    Being shameless cannot last in the end. This is a final battle of retreating troops preparing to flee, and they are likely choosing another trick.
    Three days of hard fighting once basically eliminated sparrows; eliminating individualism is much more troublesome than eliminating sparrows. We must constantly and persistently maintain this situation: making individualism like a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it. Forcing it to have nowhere to hide, no place to conceal itself, until it completely lays down its arms and surrenders.
    Whether it is "noble individualism" or stinky tofu-style individualism, they are both flagpoles behind the local earth god's temple, and to enable monkeys to quickly transform into humans, they should all be subject to a furious axe strike.

    冲破个人主义三道防线
    马铁丁
    社会主义思想的正义之师，正在对资产阶级个人主义穷追猛打，要把资产阶级个人主义搞臭。
    那么，个人主义就一败涂地，束手就擒了吗？不，不，它在步步为营、节节设防。
    第一道防线名为“并无其事”。
    “你有个人主义！”
    “我有个人主义吗？简直白日见鬼！”
    当人们把个人主义的事实，一五一十地端到他面前，而他又狡赖不得的时候，于是退到第二道防线。
    第二道防线，名为“高尚的个人主义”。
    “谁没有一点个人主义？但个人主义也是有区别的：一种是高尚的个人主义，一种是庸俗的个人主义，我是属于高尚的个人主义。”
    个人主义是对集体主义来讲的。个人主义的最终目的，是为了自己，为了个人，说得通俗一点，就叫做自私自利。“高尚的个人主义”，无非是把个人主义隐藏得较深，装璜得较美，没有庸俗个人主义那么赤裸裸吧了。庸俗的个人主义，固然是庸俗的，高尚的个人主义，归根到底还是庸俗的。而且它是糖包的砒礵，更容易迷惑人，为害也就更大。
    “凭本领吃饭”，据说是“高尚的个人主义”一种。好吧，就算你有本领，吃的饭，也不是普通饭，是美酒佳肴，非常好的饭。可是，仅仅为了吃饭，那么你的本领，既可以为革命服务，也可以为反革命服务；既可以为共产党服务，也可以为国民党服务。如果一个人的本领，去为反革命、为国民党服务，怎么叫做“高尚”呢？
    或者你会说，现在是人民当家作主了，服务，当然是为人民服务。好吧，就算你是为人民服务的，可是，服务不过是手段，而你自己吃好饭才是最终的目的，这样一来，当个人的利益和集体的利益发生矛盾的时候，那就很可能牺牲集体，成全个人，这又怎么能叫做“高尚”呢？“高尚”云云，不过是美化了的说法。
    还有第三道防线，名为“个人主义虽臭，但属臭豆腐干式的臭，气味虽坏，却颇可口”。
    这条防线，其实不成其为防线，近乎要无赖了。君不见两人相骂，失败的一面，用“包下来”的办法，权作抵抗吗？
    “你骂我无耻吗？我就无耻”！“你骂我无聊吗？我就无聊！”“你骂我臭吗？我就臭！”
    要无赖究竟是不能持久的，这乃是准备逃遁的退兵一战，想来又在另选花样了。
    三天苦战，曾经基本消灭麻雀；消灭个人主义要比消灭麻雀麻烦得多，我们必须经常的、持久的保持着这末一个形势：使个人主义成为老鼠过街，人人喊打。逼得它无法遁形，无从匿迹，直到全部缴械投降。
    “高尚的个人主义”也好，臭豆腐干式的个人主义也好，都是土地堂后的旗杆，为使猴子能够赶快变人，都应在怒斫一斧之列。
