    What Role

    After Britain announced its so-called new plan for Cyprus, New Zealand Prime Minister Walter Nash immediately expressed his support. However, perhaps inadvertently, he also let slip this sentence in his speech: "The main implications of this proposal are not at all clear."

    It is utterly absurd to express support for a proposal when its main implications are not understood. However, this absurd thing also illustrates the role of the New Zealand Prime Minister. It turns out that his attitude on some foreign affairs is not determined by his own understanding and consideration, but simply acts according to the needs of Downing Street.

    什么角色
    英国关于塞浦路斯的所谓新计划公布以后，新西兰总理华尔特·纳希马上表示支持。但是，可能是由于不小心，他在发言中又漏出了这样一句话：这个建议的主要含意一点也不清楚。
    对建议的主要含意还弄不清楚就表示支持，这是一件多么荒唐的事情。不过，这件荒唐的事情倒也说明了新西兰总理究竟是怎样一种角色。原来，他在一些外交事务上所采取的态度，并不是决定于自己的认识和考虑，而只是按照唐宁街的需要行事而已。外国报刊拾零
