Songs of the Reservoir Construction Site
    Sweat sprinkles the earth, the dam is built.
    Sweat is sparkling,
    Sprinkled all over the Thirteen Tombs;
    Each drop of sweat is a star,
    The stars are not as bright as the sweat.
    The stars in the sky are cold and clear,
    My sweat is full of passion,
    Sweat sprinkles the earth like gems,
    Sweat sprinkles the earth, the dam is built.
                Xu Zongyao

    The Masses Outperform Living Gods
    A gathering of heroes before the Thirteen Tombs,
    Enthusiasm bursts through the nine layers of heaven,
    We will have green waters embraced by verdant mountains,
    The wisdom of the masses surpasses living gods.
    A flood-control dam is built on the mountainside,
    Irrigating crops and generating electricity,
    A winding road encircles the lake on undulating hills,
    Peach blossoms are red and willows are green, a fresh landscape.
    Theaters and guesthouses are built,
    Boats float on the lake,
    Sandy beaches become good farmland,
    Tiger Mountain becomes Fruit and Flower Mountain.
    Could it be the landscape of Guilin has arrived?
    Could it be West Lake is before our eyes?
    Chang'e stops and does not fly to the moon,
    She wants to come to the construction site to carry earth,
    The sweetest thing is the fruit of labor,
    Happiness—
    Nothing surpasses building our motherland’s beautiful rivers and mountains.
                  Zhu Mingdao

    Carrying Happiness with a Carrying Pole
    A carrying pole, soft and smooth,
    Carrying baskets, wobbling and swaying,
    I move mountains for the high mountains,
    Squeak, squeak, moving forward.
    You in front, me behind,
    A long line of us carrying,
    One trip to the left, one trip to the right,
    People coming and going like a flowing stream.
    Carrying until the sun sets in the west,
    Carrying until the moon shows its face,
    Carrying until the dam grows taller,
    Carrying until the high mountain lowers its head.
    Carrying happiness with a carrying pole,
    The people carrying earth are happy and carefree,
    Endless strength to be used,
    Squeak, squeak, moving forward.
                 De Chong

    水库工地之歌
    汗珠洒地坝修成
    汗珠亮晶晶，
    洒遍十三陵；
    一粒汗珠一颗星，
    星星不如汗珠明。
    天上星星冷清清，
    我的汗珠是热情，
    汗珠洒地像宝石，
    汗珠洒地坝修成。
                许宗尧
    群众赛过活神仙
    十三陵前英雄会，
    干劲冲破九重天，
    要让那青山抱绿水，
    群众的智慧赛过活神仙。
    山腰筑起拦洪坝，
    又浇庄稼又发电，
    起伏山峦环湖路，
    桃红柳绿景色鲜。
    修建剧院迎宾馆，
    湖水之上荡游船，
    沙滩变成好水地，
    虎山变成花果山。
    莫非桂林山水到，
    莫非西湖在眼前，
    嫦娥止步不奔月，
    要来工地把土担，
    香甜要数劳动果，
    幸福——
    莫过建设祖国的好河山。
                  朱明道
    扁担挑出幸福来
    一根扁担软溜溜，
    挑起筐子颤悠悠，
    我给高山大搬家，
    吱儿啦吱儿啦往前走。
    你在前那个我在后，
    前后挑起一大溜，
    左一趟那个右一趟，
    人来人往似水流。
    挑的那太阳西山落，
    挑的那月亮露了头，
    挑的那大坝往上长，
    挑的那高山低了头。
    扁担挑出幸福来，
    挑土的人儿乐悠悠，
    浑身的劲儿使不尽，
    吱儿啦吱儿啦往前走。
                 德崇
