Xinhua News Agency report: Public opinion in various countries has expressed condemnation of the US and British conspiracy to intervene in Lebanon by armed force.

According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur Berlin report on the 19th: The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Abdul Hassouneh, in response to a question from "Neues Deutschland" correspondent Lothar Kilmer regarding the situation in Lebanon, condemned the imperialists who plan to openly interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said that any foreign intervention would only complicate the situation and would not help to find a solution.

TASS reported that Plichevsky wrote in "Pravda" on the 19th that the US ruling clique wants to use the flag of the United Nations to cover up imperialist intervention. It is no secret that the United States is exerting pressure to make the United Nations observers sent to Lebanon at the insistence of the West play a police role, just like the United Nations forces sent to the Egyptian-Israeli border.

After citing foreign newspapers' reports that the British and American ruling cliques are using the Lebanese incident to attack Damascus, Cairo, and the liberation movements of the Arab and African peoples, Plichevsky wrote that if the colonial countries attempt to realize these imperialist conspiracies, they will be fiercely opposed and unable to cope.

Vietnam's "People's Daily" said in its editorial on the 20th that the conspiracy of US imperialism and their followers to usurp the name of the United Nations to intervene in Lebanon by armed force is a shameless challenge to the people of the world and will create a new war crisis in the Near and Middle East.

India's "Bombay Chronicle" said on the 19th that US Secretary of State Dulles' recent remarks threatening intervention in Lebanon were "a typical Dulles-style declaration of war." "The Hindustan Times" said on the 20th that invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs would internationalize the Lebanese civil war and cause disaster to the entire Middle East and even regions beyond the Middle East.

The Jakarta evening newspaper "Kewaspadaan" pointed out in its editorial on the 19th that Dulles's remarks about Lebanon exposed the essence of the United States. It is clear that the United States is trying to solve the Lebanese problem according to its own will. The newspaper pointed out that this activity of interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs is dangerous. The Indonesian-language "Sin Po" pointed out in its editorial on the 19th that the Lebanese people's struggle against Chamoun is a patriotic struggle against the imperialists. If it were not for the United States' aid to the Chamoun government, the Lebanese people would have achieved final victory long ago.

According to a Middle East News Agency correspondent in Khartoum, Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil said in commenting on the news that the United States and Britain are preparing to intervene in Lebanon by armed force that foreign intervention in the Lebanese situation may cause the most serious consequences.

Sudanese National Union Party leader Azhari said that any interference by any country in Lebanon's internal affairs will be resolutely condemned by the people of all countries. Azhari said in an interview with the Sudanese "Al-Rai al-Aam" reporter: The situation in Lebanon most powerfully proves how harmful the consequences of pursuing a policy subordinate to the United States can be.

    各国舆论支持黎巴嫩人民的斗争
    严斥美英企图侵略黎巴嫩
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论对美英两国企图武装干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋，纷纷表示谴责。
    据德意志通讯社柏林19日讯：阿拉伯联盟秘书长阿卜杜勒·哈苏纳在回答“新德意志报”驻开罗记者洛塔·基尔默就黎巴嫩局势向他提出的问题时，谴责了那些打算公开干涉黎巴嫩内政的帝国主义。他说，一切外来的干涉只会使局势复杂化，而不会有助于找到一个解决办法。”
    塔斯社报道，普利歇夫斯基19日在“真理报”上发表文章说，美国统治集团想用联合国的旗帜来掩盖帝国主义的干涉。美国在施加压力，使在西方坚持下派到黎巴嫩去的联合国观察员像联合国派到埃及—以色列边境的军队一样起警察作用，这已经不是什么秘密了。
    普利歇夫斯基在援引了外国报纸关于英美统治集团通过黎巴嫩事件来打击大马士革、开罗以及阿拉伯和非洲各国人民的解放运动的消息后写道，如果殖民国家企图实现这些帝国主义阴谋，它们就会遭到激烈反对而招架不住。
    越南“人民报”在20日的社论中说，美帝国主义和他们的随从企图盗用联合国名义来武装干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋，是向世界人民作无耻的挑战，并且将会在中近东制造一个新的战争危机。
    印度“孟买纪事报”19日说，美国国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的扬言要干涉黎巴嫩的谈话，是“典型杜勒斯式的战争宣言”。“印度斯坦时报”20日说，援用艾森豪威尔主义来干涉黎巴嫩的内政，将会使黎巴嫩的内战国际化，并且会给整个中东以至于中东以外的地区造成灾难。
    雅加达晚报“警惕报”19日在社论中指出，杜勒斯的关于黎巴嫩的谈话暴露了美国的本质。很明显，美国企图按照自己的意志来解决黎巴嫩问题。报纸指出，这种干涉黎巴嫩内政的活动是危险的。印度尼西亚文“新报”19日在社论中指出，黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙的斗争是一个反对帝国主义者的爱国斗争。要是没有美国对夏蒙政府的援助，黎巴嫩人民本来老早就会获得了最后胜利。
    据中东通讯社驻喀土穆记者报道，苏丹总理哈利勒在评论美英准备武装干涉黎巴嫩的消息时说，外国干涉黎巴嫩的局势可能引起最严重的后果。
    苏丹民族联合党领袖阿扎里说，任何一个国家对黎巴嫩内政的任何干涉都将遭到各国人民的坚决谴责。阿扎里在向苏丹“时代报”记者发表谈话时说：黎巴嫩局势最有力地证明了：奉行从属于美国的政策会产生多么有害的后果。
