Xinhua News Agency, 16th, Tokyo dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party published a statement in the "Akahata" on June 9th, criticizing the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, titled: "Wage an Uncompromising Struggle Against Revisionism that Destroys the Unity of the Communist Movement." The full text is as follows:

(I)
As the "Akahata" has reported several times recently, the communist and workers' parties of various countries are severely criticizing the program adopted by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at its Seventh National Congress, considering that program to be a revisionist program that distorts the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, attempts to undermine the unity of the international communist movement and socialist countries, and serves the conspiracies of imperialism.

Our party's Central Committee, although perhaps slightly later than other countries because it is far from Yugoslavia, received the draft program from the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and later obtained the discussion materials from the Congress. We have carefully discussed these materials.

As everyone knows, when the Cominform issued the "Resolution on the Situation in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" at the meeting held in June 1948, our party supported the content of this resolution. We believe that the content of this resolution, which pointed out that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had deviated from the principles of Marxism-Leninism at that time and committed the error of bourgeois nationalism, is still correct today.

Later, the Cominform passed the resolution "The Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the Hands of Murderers and Spies" at the meeting held in November 1949, but, regrettably, the content of this resolution violated the facts and was wrong. This is also evident from the fact that the communist and workers' parties of various countries participating in the Cominform meeting have revoked this resolution. We can also understand the great emotional damage suffered by the Yugoslav comrades due to this resolution. Therefore, since the publication of the Belgrade Declaration in 1955, the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp have sincerely taken various positive measures to improve relations with Yugoslavia, and the communist and workers' parties of various countries have gradually restored friendly relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. We have sincerely welcomed these actions and sincerely hope that true friendly relations can be restored on the basis of common beliefs in Marxism-Leninism.

However, the subsequent situation did not develop as we had hoped. The year before last, due to the instigation of US imperialists, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in Hungary. At that time, Yugoslav leaders such as Tito and Kadar actually said that the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary was "interference in internal affairs" and called the leaders of the fraternal parties in various countries who supported the Soviet Union's position "Stalinists" and criticized them. We, who had been trying to avoid criticizing the guiding principles of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, could not remain silent about such words and deeds at that time. Our party frankly criticized the words and deeds of the Yugoslav leaders.

We know that the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in November last year was of epoch-making significance in strengthening the unity of the international communist movement and the socialist countries, and we had hoped that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia would have representatives participating in this event. Regrettably, according to the published joint declaration, the name of the Yugoslav representative cannot be seen among the signatories of the "Declaration" of fraternal parties of the socialist countries. However, we know that the Yugoslav representative signed the "Peace Declaration" of sixty-four fraternal parties, including our party, and learned that at least some progress had been made in the unity of the international communist movement in this regard.

(II)
However, after reading the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia sent this time, we found that the analysis of international relations made in this program is completely contrary to the content of the "Peace Declaration" signed by the representative of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The "Peace Declaration" raised the question: "Where does the threat to the cause of peace and the threat to the security of the people of all countries come from?" At the same time, it clearly pointed out that "those who are keen on war and fantasize about war" are "monopoly capital, especially the American monopolists." The "Peace Declaration" also said: "In all socialist countries, there are no classes or social strata that are keen on war." "The argument that socialist countries seem to want to impose their system on others by force and threaten peace is nothing more than an attempt to deceive peace-loving people."

But, surprisingly, the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia negates this view of the "Peace Declaration," and this view is now even becoming common sense in the peace movement. This program does not want to frankly admit that the root cause of modern war lies in monopoly capitalism, a well-known Marxist-Leninist principle. In particular, the entire program makes no mention of the aggressiveness of US imperialism, its attempt to dominate the world, and the actions it takes to achieve this conspiracy, which are of great significance today. Moreover, while using obscure words to cover up, the program attributes the danger of war to the existence of "two opposing military and political blocs" and seeks the "one of the roots" of these groups in "policies that deal with international relations entirely from a position of strength and the struggle for hegemony." That is to say, socialist countries have also been pursuing a policy of "position of strength." Is this not what the "Peace Declaration" calls "an attempt to deceive peace-loving people"?

The views and positions of this program not only completely violate the "Peace Declaration" signed by the representative of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and undermine the unity of the international communist movement, but also actually serve the aggressive imperialist group in the United States with the action of attacking the peace policies of socialist countries. I am afraid that everyone can see this very clearly. As further study of this program will make clear, the leaders of Yugoslavia cannot understand the basic contradiction of the modern era during the transition from capitalism to socialism—the contradiction between the socialist world system and the capitalist world system—and replaces it deviously with the problem of "two military and political blocs."

It is precisely because this program proceeds from such a point of view that it says such strange views as that the "development of economic cooperation" among all countries in the world, including the imperialist countries, "is an integral part of the socialist road to world economic development," and vigorously beautifies the United Nations, which is actually manipulated by US imperialism. However, it did not consider at all the views of the "Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries," which said that "in our era, the development of the world depends on the process and results of the competition between two opposing social systems."

This program, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, no, even on the pretext of fighting against "pragmatic revision of Marxism-Leninism," put forward the above-mentioned views and boasted that it was correct. This is nothing else, but it is revisionism that serves the interests of imperialism and attempts to skillfully paralyze the revolutionary will of the working class.

(III)
This program emphasizes the saying of "two opposing military and political blocs" and describes itself as if it is standing in a position beyond the blocs. But in fact, it tries its best to avoid attacking the imperialist camp, but specializes in attacking the socialist camp, especially the core of this camp—the Soviet Union.

This program emphasizes the need to cooperate through the United Nations on the one hand, but on the other hand, it uses negative words everywhere about the cooperation of socialist countries; moreover, it even deviously substitutes the economic cooperation of socialist countries for the problem of "military and political blocs" and attacks it. It particularly concentrates its efforts on denying the leading role of the Soviet Union with the term "hegemonism." It says: "Establishing any form of hegemony... a socialist country will maintain unequal relations with others or with other socialist countries in various ways."

I am afraid that everyone can see very clearly that this is a condemnation of the Soviet Union.

Stalin made certain great-power chauvinistic mistakes in the later period of his activities, which resulted in some abnormal phenomena in the relationship between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This is a fact that everyone now knows. However, it is also very obvious that these abnormal phenomena have been gradually eliminated in recent years.

Today, if the leading role played by the Soviet Union in the socialist camp and the international communist movement is still confused with great-power chauvinism, it is not only a big mistake, but the view itself is something that attempts to undermine the unity of the international proletariat.

The reason why the Soviet Union plays a leading role is by no means due to some "hegemonism" or some "political and ideological monopoly" as this program says. It was not decided artificially by someone, but was objectively created by historical conditions.

The Soviet Union is the first socialist country in the world, and today it is the most powerful and experienced country in the socialist camp. Therefore, it is naturally in such a position that it can give the greatest assistance to all socialist countries and to the people of all countries. From this arises its leading role.

Faced with the attacks carried out by the imperialist camp headed by the United States, it is a matter of course that the international communist movement and the socialist camp unite around the Soviet Union to defend their own interests, and this is the only correct method from the point of view of historical development.

The reactionary forces all over the world, with the aggressive imperialist group in the United States as their core, are trying to undermine the cause of the international proletariat, and the trick that they are focusing their greatest efforts on today is to destroy this unity with the Soviet Union as its core. They place their greatest hope on: a socialist country opposing the Soviet Union, and a Marxist-Leninist party opposing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As long as there is a slight tendency in this direction, the bourgeois newspapers of the capitalist world will shout loudly. From this we can also know how much they expect from that kind of thing.

Under these circumstances, saying that the Soviet Union's leading role is "hegemonism" and criticizing it can only serve the interests of imperialism. This program pretends to condemn great-power chauvinism on the surface, but in reality it exposes its own face standing on the position of nationalism. Although this program emphasizes proletarian internationalism in words, it has extracted the content of proletarian internationalism that should be emphasized most today, and is actually standing on the position of bourgeois nationalism.

(IV)
If we further study this program, we will know that the above-mentioned errors are by no means produced from shallow roots. In this program, the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism are denied everywhere.

For example, this program negates such a basic principle: the bourgeois state is a machine that serves the bourgeoisie, and in today's terms it is a machine that serves the monopoly bourgeoisie. This program believes that state capitalism is "a new socialist element in the economy in terms of its objective tendency." It argues that the state seems to have increasingly become a "independent thing" beyond classes.

This is a revisionist view that has existed before. According to this view, capitalism will grow into socialism due to the natural growth of "socialist factors" within capitalism. In fact, this program says: "The special forms of state-capitalist relations can be the last effort of capitalism to preserve itself, or the first step toward socialism, or both." As to whether it can become socialism, this program believes that it will ultimately depend on the working class' "struggle to win leadership in political power." This is obviously a theory of social evolution, not a theory of social revolution. Here, the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution is completely negated.

Since it is according to such a theory, of course, it will negate the boundary between socialism and capitalism, and negate the boundary between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. From such a theory, it can be concluded that some bourgeois countries are already partially building socialism; due to the cooperation of such bourgeois countries, the entire human society is already growing into socialism.

This program both beautifies the role of US imperialism and beautifies the role of the United Nations, which is manipulated by US imperialism. Logically speaking, this is a very natural thing.

While pointing out the above-mentioned logical inferences, we cannot but believe that it is probably the large amount of "state assistance" provided by US imperialism that has ideologically produced such anti-Marxist logic in the leaders of Yugoslavia.

(V)
This program, which beautifies the role of the bourgeois state in this way, at the same time makes a completely negative evaluation of the role of socialist countries and the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a characteristic of this program.

This program says that in order to develop socialism, although it is necessary for the state to manage the economy for a certain period, continued centralized management by the state will "lead to the increasing concentration of management and the increasingly close combination of state and party institutions," and will produce "tendencies toward bureaucracy and bureaucratic statism." Moreover, such bureaucracy and state bureaucracy will eventually produce "cult of personality."

According to the theory put forward in this program, socialist countries that continue to manage the economy by the state must inevitably produce "cult of personality." Isn't this a slander against the countries of the socialist camp!

Needless to say, the centralism of socialist countries must be established on the basis of extensive democracy. Socialist countries must manage the economy in close combination with the masses of the people. This is the principle of democratic centralism in the life of socialist countries.

This program emphasizes "socialist democracy" everywhere, but forgets to emphasize that socialist democracy needs centralism. This program believes that strengthening centralism is equal to bureaucracy. Lenin said: "In our country, centralism, arbitrariness, and bureaucracy are often confused together. But this confusion is absolutely intolerable for Marxists." However, this program is committing this "absolutely intolerable" error.

It is a completely unacceptable mistake to say that the "cult of personality" seems to be an inevitable product of socialist countries or an inevitable product of socialist countries when managing the economy. Isn't it clear to everyone that this theory is beneficial to the enemies of socialist countries?

The leaders of Yugoslavia oppose democratic centralism to autonomy, oppose state management of the economy to producer management of the economy, and say that taking the latter approach can eliminate "tendencies toward bureaucracy and bureaucratic statism." Lenin once said when criticizing the theory of "producer management" that this is a "syndicalist, anarchist tendency" and a "retreat from Marxism in its essence." This program is retreating from Marxism-Leninism in its essence. The main thing in Marxist-Leninist theory—the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat—has been distorted.

This program, which regards democratic centralism as bureaucracy, of course also makes a negative evaluation of the leading role of the Communist Party in logic. As a result, the phrases "ideological monopoly" and "political hegemonism" are frequently used to attack the leading role of the Communist Party. This program says that without the Communist Party, without the leadership of the Communist Party, the dictatorship of the proletariat can also move forward and socialist construction can also be successful. Therefore, this program says: "The idea that socialism can only be embodied in these parties, and only through them, is theoretically incorrect and very harmful in practice." At the same time, it also says that in countries such as the United States of America, it is possible to achieve socialism by relying on trade unions.

This view of this program, although logically consistent with the aforementioned view that socialism can be achieved through evolution without revolution, is also derived from these practices: believing that democratic centralism is bureaucracy, negating the leading role of the Communist Party, the role of Communist Party leaders, and the role of party discipline. This program constantly attacks "bureaucracy," "dogmatism," and "sectarianism" in the international communist movement, while linking these things with the leading role of the Communist Party. From these situations, one can know what its real intention is.

Lenin once said: To negate the leading role of the party, to negate the role of leaders, and to negate discipline, "this is tantamount to completely disarming the proletariat in order to help the bourgeoisie. This is precisely the inferiority of the petty bourgeoisie: disorganization, vacillation, impatience, inability to unite, and inability to act in an orderly manner. If this inferiority is allowed to run rampant, it will inevitably lead to the complete defeat of any proletarian revolutionary movement."

Even if it is said that this program was put forward in order to undermine the international communist movement, it is probably not an exaggeration. That theory has become a completely anti-Soviet and anti-communist theory that serves imperialism.

(VI)
We believe that as long as we look at a few of the above-mentioned fundamental points, we can clearly see what role this program will play in today's world. This is a thorough revisionist program that is fundamentally opposed to the position of the "two declarations" that our party has affirmed and consistently supported.

Now, the whole world has reached a new historical turning point where the east wind prevails over the west wind. The crisis-ridden, aggressive imperialist group of the United States and all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world surrounding this group are making a dying struggle, attempting to turn back the wheel of history. Their spearheads are first directed at these aspects: undermining the unity of the international communist movement and undermining the unity of socialist countries.

It is very clear whose weapon the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, published at this time, is serving.

We cannot but see that when the communist parties and workers' parties of various countries are severely criticizing this program, almost all of the main bourgeois newspapers in our country are also talking about this issue in editorials or commentaries, either explicitly or implicitly supporting the attitude of the Yugoslav leaders. In particular, some newspapers, citing the achievements made by our party in this election as an example, say that in order to gain the support of the masses and seek development, the Japanese Communist Party should follow the example of Yugoslavia, "emphasize national independence" rather than "emphasize the international solidarity of the Communist Party," but "the current Japanese Communist Party is probably not brave enough to take this road," and so on. They are "paying attention" to the fact that such revisionism will also grow in our party.

Let us answer the "expectations" of the reactionary forces with the action of uncompromisingly fighting against revisionism that undermines the unity of the communist movement!

Revisionism is a bourgeois ideology, not a weak ideology that can be overcome with just one statement; it can only be overcome by constantly carrying out uncompromising struggle. Views like those put forward in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia can be seen everywhere in our country, and some are constantly being brought into our party.

If we do not uncompromisingly struggle against the revisionist tendencies manifested in underestimating the aggressive nature of US imperialism, advocating socialist doctrines that do not require the seizure of political power, and believing that it is not necessary to implement democratic centralism in the life of the party, we cannot build a truly Marxist-Leninist party.

We must greatly advance this struggle to welcome the upcoming Seventh National Congress of the Party. This is a task that we must undertake at a new historical turning point in the world.

### 日共中央委员会发表声明指出  南共纲领完全是为美帝国主义效劳  必须加强国际共产主义运动团结　对修正主义进行毫不妥协的斗争

    日共中央委员会发表声明指出
    南共纲领完全是为美帝国主义效劳
    必须加强国际共产主义运动团结　对修正主义进行毫不妥协的斗争
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会6月9日在“赤旗报”上发表了一篇批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的声明，题目是：“对破坏共产主义运动团结的修正主义毫不妥协地进行斗争”。全文如下：
    （一）
    正像最近“赤旗报”好几次报道过的那样，各国的共产党和工人党正在对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在它的第七次全国代表大会上通过的纲领进行严厉的批判，认为那个纲领是一个歪曲了马克思列宁主义一般原则的修正主义的纲领，是企图破坏国际共产主义运动和社会主义各国的团结、为帝国主义的阴谋服务的东西。
    我们党的中央委员会虽然因为远离南斯拉夫，比起其它国家来也许稍为晚了一些，但是，我们接到了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会寄来的纲领草案，后来又得到了大会的讨论材料。我们根据这些材料慎重地进行了讨论。
    正像大家知道的那样，共产党情报局在1948年6月举行的会议上发表“关于南斯拉夫共产党情况的决议”的时候，我们党支持了这项决议的内容。我们认为，指出南斯拉夫共产党当时就离开了马克思列宁主义的原则、犯了资产阶级民族主义的错误的这项决议的内容，到今天仍然是正确的。
    后来，共产党情报局在1949年11月举行的会议上通过了“南斯拉夫共产党在杀人犯和间谍掌握中”的决议，但是，令人感到遗憾，这个决议的内容违反了事实，是错误的。这一点，从参加共产党情报局会议的各国共产党和工人党已经撤销了这个决议这个事实看来，也是很明显的。我们也能够了解南斯拉夫的同志们由于这个决议而在心情上受到很大的损伤。因此，自从1955年发表贝尔格莱德宣言以来，苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家为了改善同南斯拉夫的关系，诚心诚意地采取了各种各样的积极的措施，而且，各国的共产党和工人党逐步恢复了同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的友好关系。对于这些行动，我们曾经衷心表示欢迎，并且衷心期望真正的友好关系能够在对马克思列宁主义的共同信念的基础上恢复过来。
    但是，后来的情况并没有像我们所期望的那样发展。前年，由于美帝国主义者的策动，在匈牙利发生了反革命暴乱。当时，铁托、卡德尔等南斯拉夫的领导人竟然说苏联对匈牙利的援助是“干涉内政”，并且把支持苏联的立场的各国兄弟党的领导人叫做“斯大林主义者”，而加以指责。一直尽量避免批评南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的指导方针的我们，当时对这样的言行也不能默不作声了。我们党对南斯拉夫领导人的言行坦率地提出了批评。
    我们知道去年11月在莫斯科召开的共产党和工人党代表会议，在加强国际共产主义运动团结和社会主义各国团结的事业上具有划时代的意义，对于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟有代表参加这件事情曾经寄予期望。遗憾的是，根据发表的联合宣言，在社会主义各国兄弟党的“宣言”的签名者中间，看不到南斯拉夫代表的名字。不过，我们知道南斯拉夫代表在我们党也参加了的六十四个国家兄弟党的“和平宣言”上签了名，了解到在国际共产主义运动的团结方面在这一点上总算前进了一步。
    （二）
    但是，我们读了这次送来的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案以后，发现这个纲领所作的对国际关系的分析，甚至同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表签了字的“和平宣言”的内容完全相反。
      “和平宣言”一面提出问题说：“对和平事业的威胁，对各国人民安全的威胁是来自何处呢？”同时明确地指出：“热衷于战争的和幻想战争的”是“垄断资本、尤其是美国垄断资本家”。“和平宣言”还说：“在所有社会主义国家都没有热衷于战争的阶级或社会阶层”，
  “硬说社会主义国家似乎想用暴力把自己的制度强加于别人而威胁和平的论断，无非是企图欺骗爱好和平的人们。”
    但是，令人吃惊的是，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领否定了“和平宣言”的这个见解，而这个见解目前甚至正在成为和平运动的一种常识。这个纲领不想坦率地承认引起现代战争的根源在于垄断资本主义这样一个大家都知道的马克思列宁主义原则。特别是对于今天具有重大意义的美帝国主义的侵略性、它企图统治世界的阴谋和它为了实现这个阴谋而采取的行动，整个纲领只字未提。而且，纲领在使用隐晦的词句来进行掩饰的同时，把战争的危险归因于“两个敌对的军事、政治集团”的存在，向“在处理国际关系的时候完全从实力地位和争夺霸权斗争出发的政策”寻求产生这种集团的“根源之一”。这就是说，社会主义国家也一直推行“实力地位”政策。这不是“和平宣言”所说的“企图欺骗爱好和平的人们”，究竟是什么呢？
    这个纲领的见解和立场不仅完全违背了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表签了字的“和平宣言”，破坏了国际共产主义运动的团结，而且用攻击社会主义国家的和平政策的行动，实际上为美国的侵略成性的帝国主义集团服务，这恐怕是谁都看得很清楚的。正像假如进一步研究这个纲领，就会弄清楚的那样，南斯拉夫的领导者们无法了解世界从资本主义向社会主义过渡期间的现代的基本矛盾——社会主义世界体系同资本主义世界体系的矛盾，而偷梁换柱地把它说成是“两个军事、政治集团”的问题。
    正因为这个纲领是从这样的观点出发的，所以，它说出了包括各帝国主义国家在内的世界各国“发展经济合作，才是走向世界经济发展的社会主义道路的组成部分”之类的奇怪的见解，并且极力美化实际上被美帝国主义所操纵的联合国。而对于“社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言”所说的“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果”等见解，却丝毫也没有加以考虑。
    这个纲领假借马克思列宁主义的招牌，不，甚至借口要同“对马克思列宁主义作实用主义的修正”进行斗争，提出了上述的见解，吹嘘自己正确。这不是别的什么，而正是为帝国主义的利益服务、企图巧妙地麻痹工人阶级的革命意志的修正主义。
    （三）
    这个纲领强调“两个敌对的军事、政治集团”的说法，而把自己说成好像是站在超集团的地位似的。但是，实际上，它极力避免攻击帝国主义阵营，而专门攻击社会主义阵营，特别是这个阵营的核心——苏联。
    这个纲领一方面强调要通过联合国来进行合作，另一方面却对社会主义国家的合作到处搬弄否定的词句；而且，甚至把社会主义国家的经济合作也偷梁换柱地说成是什么“军事、政治集团”的问题，加以攻击。它特别集中力量，用“霸权主义”的名词来否认苏联的领导作用。它说：“建立任何形式的霸权……一个社会主义国家会以种种不同的方法维持同别人或同其他社会主义国家的不平等关系。”
    恐怕谁也看得很清楚，这是对苏联的谴责。
    斯大林在他活动的后期犯了某种大国主义的错误，因而在苏联对其他社会主义国家的关系上也产生了一些不正常的现象，这是现在大家都知道的事实。但是，在最近几年间，这种不正常的现象已经被逐步消除了，这也是很明显的。
    今天，如果仍然把苏联在社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动中所起的领导作用混淆为大国主义，那就不仅大错特错，而且，这个看法本身就是一种企图破坏国际无产阶级团结的东西。
    苏联所以起着领导作用，决不是像这个纲领所说的那样，是由于什么“霸权主义”或者什么“政治、思想的垄断”。那不是某一个人用人为的方法决定的，而是历史条件客观地造成的。
    苏联是世界上第一个社会主义国家，今天在社会主义阵营中是一个最强大、经验最丰富的国家。因此，它当然处于这样的地位：能够给所有的社会主义国家和所有的国家的人民以最大的援助。从这里，就产生出它的领导作用。
    面对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营所进行的攻击，国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营各国正团结在苏联的周围，以保卫自己的利益，这是理所当然的事情，而且，这才是从历史发展看来唯一正确的方法。
    以美国的侵略成性的帝国主义集团为核心的全世界反动势力，正在力图破坏国际无产阶级的事业，它今天集中最大精力来干的勾当正是破坏这个以苏联为核心的团结。他们把最大的希望寄托在：一个社会主义国家同苏联对立，一个马克思列宁主义的政党同苏联共产党对立。只要有一点这样的倾向出现，资本主义世界的资产阶级报纸就会大叫大嚷起来。我们从这里也就可以知道他们对那一类事情抱有多么大的期望。
    在这种情况下，说苏联的领导作用是“霸权主义”，而加以指责，这只能为帝国主义的利益服务。这个纲领表面上装出一副谴责大国主义的样子，实际上却暴露出它自己站在民族主义的立场上的面目。这个纲领虽然在词句上强调无产阶级的国际主义，但是，却抽掉了今天最应当着重的无产阶级国际主义的内容，实际上是站在资产阶级民族主义的立场上。
    （四）
    如果进一步研究这个纲领，就会知道，上述错误决不是从浅薄的根源产生的。在这个纲领里面，到处都否定了马克思列宁主义的基本观点。
    例如，这个纲领否定了这样的一个基本原则：资产阶级国家是为资产阶级服务，在今天来说就是为垄断资产阶级服务的机器。这个纲领认为国家资本主义是“经济中的新的、就其客观趋向来说，是社会主义的因素”。它主张说，国家好像已经越来越成为一个超阶级的
  “独立的东西”了。
    这是从前就有过的修正主义的观点，按照这种观点，由于资本主义内部的“社会主义因素”自然增长，资本主义会长入社会主义。实际上，这个纲领说：“国家资本主义关系的特殊形式可以是资本主义保全自己的最后努力，也可以是走向社会主义的第一步，也可以同时既是前者也是后者。”至于它能否成为社会主义，这个纲领认为最后将取决于工人阶级“争取政权中的领导作用的斗争”。这显然是社会进化的理论，而不是社会革命的理论。在这里，马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命的理论被完全否定了。
    既然是按照这样的理论，当然就会否定社会主义和资本主义之间的界限，否定社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之间的界限。从这样的理论出发来推论，就会得出这样的结论：有一部分资产阶级国家已经在局部地建设着社会主义；由于这样的资产阶级国家的合作，整个人类社会已经在长入社会主义。
    这个纲领既美化了美国帝国主义的作用，又美化了被美国帝国主义操纵的联合国的作用，这从逻辑上看来，真是一件很自然的事情。
    我们在指出上述逻辑上的推论结果的同时，不能不认为：恐怕是美国帝国主义提供的大量的“国家援助”，使南斯拉夫的领导者们在思想上产生了这样的反马克思主义的逻辑。
    （五）
    这样来美化资产阶级国家的作用的这个纲领，同时却对社会主义国家的作用和无产阶级专政的作用，作出了完全否定的评价，这就是这个纲领的特点。
    这个纲领说，为了发展社会主义，国家虽然有必要在一定的期间内管理经济，但是，继续由国家实行中央集权的管理，就会“导致管理的日益集中，国家和党的机构日益紧密结合”，就会产生“官僚主义和官僚国家主义的偏向”。而且，这样的官僚主义和国家官僚主义最后会产生“个人崇拜”。
    按照这个纲领提出的理论，继续由国家管理经济的社会主义国家必然非产生“个人崇拜”不可。这不是对社会主义阵营各国的诽谤，是什么呢！
    不消说，社会主义国家的中央集权必须建立在广泛的民主的基础上。社会主义国家管理经济必须同人民群众紧密地结合起来。这就是在社会主义国家的生活中的民主集中制原则。
    这个纲领到处强调“社会主义民主”，但是却忘记强调社会主义民主需要集中。这个纲领认为：加强集中等于官僚主义。列宁说过：“在我国，集中、专横和官僚主义经常被混淆在一起。但是，这种混淆对于马克思主义者来说，是绝对不能容许的。”可是，这个纲领正是犯了这种“绝对不能容许”的错误。
    把“个人崇拜”说成好像是社会主义国家的必然产生或者是社会主义国家管理经济的时候必然产生的东西，这是完全不能容许的错误。这种理论有利于社会主义国家的敌人，这不是谁都可以看得很清楚吗。
    南斯拉夫的领导者们把民主集中制同自治对立起来，把国家管理经济同生产者管理经济对立起来，并且说，采取后一种办法就能够消除“官僚主义和官僚国家主义的偏向”。列宁曾经在批判“生产者管理”的理论时说，这是“工团主义、无政府主义的偏向”，是“从根本上离开马克思主义的倒退”。这个纲领正是从根本上离开马克思列宁主义，实行倒退。马克思列宁主义理论的主要的东西——无产阶级专政的理论被歪曲了。
    把民主集中制看成是官僚主义的这个纲领，对共产党的领导作用在逻辑上当然也就作出了否定的评价。于是，“思想垄断”、“政治霸权主义”等词句就被频频用来攻击共产党的领导作用。这个纲领说，没有共产党，没有共产党的领导，无产阶级专政也能前进，社会主义建设也能获得成功。因而，这个纲领说：“认为社会主义只有在这些党里，也只有通过它们才能体现出来的观念，在理论上是不正确的，在实践中也是十分有害的。”同时，它还说：例如在美利坚合众国那样的国家，依靠工会也有实现社会主义的可能。
    这个纲领的这种观点，同前面所说的不通过革命、依靠进化也能够实现社会主义的观点，在逻辑上虽然也一脉相通，但是，同时，这种见解也是从这些做法产生的：认为民主集中制就是官僚主义，否定共产党的领导作用、共产党领导人的作用和党的纪律的作用。这个纲领不断地攻击国际共产主义运动中的“官僚主义”、“教条主义”、“宗派主义”，同时把这些东西同共产党的领导作用连在一起。从这些情况看来，就可以知道它的真正意图何在。
    列宁曾经说过：否定党的领导作用，否定领导者的作用，否定纪律，“这就等于完全解除无产阶级的武装以帮助资产阶级。这也就恰恰是小资产阶级的散漫、动摇、不能忍耐、不能团结、不能整齐动作等等的劣根性。这种劣根性如果任其横行，就必然会使任何无产阶级革命运动都一败涂地。”
    即使说这个纲领正是为了破坏国际共产主义运动而提出来的，恐怕也决不是过份的说法。那种理论已经成为完全为帝国主义服务的反苏、反共的理论了。

    我们认为，只要看一看以上所说的带有根本性质的几点，就可以清楚这个纲领在今天的世界上要起什么样的作用。这是一个同我们党已经肯定并且一贯支持的“两个宣言”的立场根本对立、彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领。
    现在，全世界已经到了东风压倒西风的新的历史转折点。陷入危机的美国的侵略成性的帝国主义集团和环绕这个集团的资本主义世界的一切反动势力，正在作垂死的挣扎，妄图使历史的车轮倒退。他们的矛头首先指向这些方面：破坏国际共产主义运动的团结，破坏社会主义国家的团结。
    在这个时候发表的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领，究竟是一个为谁服务的武器，那是很清楚的。
    我们不能不看到：在各国共产党、工人党对这个纲领严厉地进行批判的时候，我国几乎所有的主要的资产阶级报纸也都在社论或者评论里面谈到这个问题，或明或暗地支持着南斯拉夫领导者们的态度。特别是有一部分报纸，举出我们党在这次大选中取得的成绩作为例子，说什么日本共产党为了获得群众的支持，求得发展，与其重视“共产党的国际团结”，倒不如效法南斯拉夫，“重视民族的独立性”，不过，“现在的日本共产党恐怕没有勇气走这条道路”云云。他们正在“注意”在我们党内也会生长出那样的修正主义。
    让我们以毫不妥协地对破坏共产主义运动团结的修正主义进行斗争的行动，来回答反动势力的这种“期望”吧！
    修正主义是一种资产阶级的思想，并不是一种只靠一纸声明就能够克服的根基薄弱的思想；只有不断地进行毫不妥协的斗争，才能加以克服。像南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领提出的那样的见解，在我们国内到处都可以看到，一部分还不断地被带进我们党内来。
    对于在对美帝国主义的侵略性本质上作过低估计、主张不需要取得政权的社会主义学说、认为在党的生活中不需要实行民主集中制等等方面表现出来的修正主义偏向，如果不毫不妥协地进行斗争，就不能建设真正的马克思列宁主义的政党。
    我们必须大大地推进这个斗争，来迎接即将举行的党的第七次全国代表大会。这是我们处在世界新的历史转折点所不得不承担的任务。
