Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The Songliao Petroleum Prospecting Team of the Ministry of Geology has recently achieved results that preliminarily confirm that the Songliao Plain will soon become one of China's most important oil regions.

	As early as the end of April this year, the prospecting team drilled into two oil sandstone layers, seventy centimeters and fifty centimeters thick, in a borehole of an oil-bearing structure in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, proving that there are many oil accumulations deep in the Songliao Plain.

	On June 17th, the prospecting team encountered a new oil-bearing sandstone layer with a thickness of more than three meters (not yet penetrated) in a structural borehole near Yangdachengzi Town, northwest of Gongzhuling. Crude oil seeped out after the core was taken out, further indicating that the hope of finding an oil field in this area is extremely high.

    松辽平原有石油
    据新华社25日讯　地质部松辽石油普查大队在最近获得的成果中，已经初步证实：松辽平原不久将成为我国最重要的油区之一。
    早在今年4月底，这个普查大队在吉林省扶余县一个储油构造的钻孔中，就曾经钻到了厚达七十公分和五十公分的两个油砂岩层，证明松辽平原深处有很多的石油集潴。
    6月17日，这个普查大队又在公主岭西北杨大城子镇附近的构造钻孔中，遇到了一个新的厚度在三公尺以上（现在尚未穿透）的含油砂岩层。岩芯取出后有原油渗出，进一步说明了在这个地区内找到油田的希望极大。
