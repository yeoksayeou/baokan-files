    "Hundred Items of Thrift" - A Crystallization of Political and Economic Work
    --Introducing the Experience of Zhangsanying Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longhua County in "Hundred Items of Thrift"
    The Chengde District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province
    Zhangsanying Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longhua County, Hebei Province, was established in 1949. The cooperative has five stores and thirty employees, including four Party members and seven Youth League members. Twenty-nine of the employees joined the workforce after the founding of the People's Republic.
    Two years ago, the cooperative's political work was weak, and there was a lot of loss and waste within the cooperative. The warehouse was left unchecked for a long time, pastries were eaten by rats and insects, black dates rotted into mud, mice nested in the broom pile, and egg losses reached 15%. The two mules were not well managed and became "long-term patients." The cadres' thinking was also relatively chaotic. Some people complained about wages and subsidies, and did not work with peace of mind, while those who worked diligently were ridiculed by some people.
    Everyone thrifty, everything thrifty, always thrifty, everywhere thrifty.
    In 1956, according to the instructions of the local Party committee and the superior cooperative, the cooperative conscientiously implemented the policy of "building the cooperative through diligence and thrift," rectified the Party's grassroots organization, established a single branch, appointed a full-time branch secretary, and further strengthened political and ideological work. Especially after the rectification movement, the masses were fully mobilized, which enabled the cooperative to persist in carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign for two years as if it were one day, establishing a good atmosphere of everyone being thrifty, everything being thrifty, always being thrifty, and everywhere being thrifty, and creating a model deed of "hundred items of thrift," saving the country 7,529 yuan of wealth. The township general branch secretary said: "Now our supply and marketing cooperative is very different from the past. In the past, it was 'official-style,' but now it is a thrifty family." When mentioning the diligence and thrift of the supply and marketing cooperative, the masses praised: "Everyone engages in thrift, and treasures are dug everywhere; garbage is regarded as gold and silver, and waste products are turned into agate. Not wasting half a penny, not wasting a drop of urine. Everyone is diligent and thrifty, not afraid of hardship and storms."
    Do everything yourself
    Since 1957, all loading, unloading, handling, item repair, and simple basic construction of the cooperative have been done entirely by themselves. Last year, the employees loaded and unloaded vehicles more than 160 times on their own, totaling 400,000 jin, without spending a penny on loading and unloading fees. In the summer, the Yixun River flooded and the bridge was washed away. Vehicles from various places had to be ferried, and goods were carried by porters. However, all the employees of the cooperative insisted on carrying the goods themselves, persisting for three months during the flood without spending any money.
    In 1957, they built two salt warehouses and repaired the wainscoting of the store. The basketball rack in the courtyard was made by the employees in their spare time using box boards. A set of fire-fighting equipment was also repaired by the employees using picked-up waste products.
    Last year, they purchased 110,000 jin of medicinal materials, and all loading, unloading, and drying were done by the employees themselves. They also used waste box boards to repair windows and make buckets, and made tin soldering oil pumps themselves. They roasted chestnuts and melon seeds themselves. When the grate was burned out, they used waste iron sheets to make it themselves. Driver Chen Ming repaired his own carts, patched inner tubes, and replaced crossbeams. Last year, they also processed more than 200 jin of hemp fiber from broken burlap sacks, meeting the urgent needs of local school construction. Because they do everything themselves, the masses call them "know-it-alls."
    Reduce commodity losses by all possible means
    The employees have created many ways to reduce and eliminate commodity losses. In order to change the phenomenon of goods on display fading and deteriorating for many years, they replaced the displayed goods once a week. They made a large number of commodity storage boxes themselves. The mixed storage of non-staple foods was changed to classified storage. All commodities that were afraid of insect bites and rat eating were hung up, and all commodities that were afraid of moisture were stored off the ground. Commodities that were afraid of tossing were "packaged once." In 1957, commodity losses dropped from three per thousand to 0.9 per thousand. In order to reduce losses and increase the cooperative's income, the employees used their brains everywhere. The kerosene in large barrels could not be completely pumped out, so they used wooden sticks wrapped with rags to wipe the oil barrels, wiping out more than 30 jin of oil in a year. The bamboo leaves used to wrap sugar were all saved up, and two jin of sugar were extracted from the bamboo leaves. More than 50 jin of flour were swept out of 2,200 flour sacks. In 1955, when the cooperative sold vermicelli, more than 30 jin of broken vermicelli ends were produced. They were exposed to the wind and sun and covered with a lot of soil. The price was reduced from 4.6 jiao per jin to 1 jiao, but no one bought them. Comrade Liu Fa of the non-staple food department washed the vermicelli clean, fried them in oil, and then used the leftover sugar residue from selling candied haws to make syrup and turn the vermicelli ends into snacks, which were named "Vermicelli Cake," which was sweet, crisp, and sold out in a few days.
    Love the cooperative as your home
    From top to bottom, the employees of Zhangsanying Supply and Marketing Cooperative are diligent and conscientious in loving the cooperative as their home. They take care of everything in the cooperative like loyal and hardworking housewives. "Safety frames" were made for the shades on the oil lamps. The branch secretary accidentally broke a teacup and immediately compensated with a new one. Yin Qinglian gave all the 11 yuan he earned from cutting glass for the school in his spare time to the cooperative. Every time driver Chen Ming went out, he always kicked the stones out of the way on the road, and filled in or went around small pits. No matter how tired he was when he came back, he always took the animals for a walk. He often fed the animals until after 3:00 in the morning. When asked why he didn't go to bed earlier, he said: "Horses don't get fat without night grass, and it's my duty to stay with them." Therefore, none of the three animals had any problems last year, and the cost of medicine was reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. The masses said: "Even the driver of the supply and marketing cooperative loves horses as much as his life."
    Everyone finds tricks, waste products become treasures
    The employees are all vying to find tricks to increase production and save money and to accumulate waste products. Everyone rushes to pick up all used packaging paper, cardboard boxes, rope ends, and nails. According to the old rules, mutton was slaughtered without the sheep's bladder heart, but they scraped more than 30 jin of oil from the sheep's bladder heart. In order to save coal, they screened all the burned coal ash last year, screening out 940 jin of coal kernels and more than 800 jin of coal fines in a year. They felt it was a pity to see farmers throwing away all the kohlrabi roots, so they purchased 500 jin, peeled them, and mixed them with other vegetables to make pickles for sale, which were named "Better Than Jinzhou," which was very popular among the masses. Even more touching was that the employees extracted 160 jin of grain from the crops of 1,800 slaughtered chickens, solving the feed problem for more than 1,000 chickens. After this incident spread, the farmers made up a ditty: "The supply and marketing cooperative is really commendable, making money from dead chickens; taking grain from the chicken's crop, everyone is surprised to hear it!"
    Spend less money and do more things, do things even without spending money
    The employees are careful and meticulous everywhere and are unwilling to waste a penny. They make full use of waste paper to pack goods. They did not buy packaging paper or office paper for nine months, and they did not buy any office supplies for more than four months. The store never buys new pen nibs. The accountant uses the remaining ones after sharpening them again. A carbon pen has been used for eight years and is still in use. The custody accounts and cards are printed by themselves, and they never go to the printing factory. The more than 40 packages of matches used last year were all bought with the money saved from accumulating bones. The cart that runs to Longhua always brings its own fodder all year round and does not buy it in the store. The whip used the whip end is made of waste leather, and the reins are woven from old objects. The employee dormitory uses old cattail bags to make kang mats. In order to save paper rope, broken cloth strips are used to tie money, which are brought back after payment and used all year round. For the telephone ten-day report stipulated by the county, they always prepare the form in advance and send it by cart or find someone to bring it, saving 60 yuan in telephone bills a year. Cook Gao Yongsheng uses residual heat to make alkali with warm water after each meal. Last year, he made more than 10,000 jin of alkali using this method, saving a lot of fuel.
    When the cooperative trial-produced Dayushu wine last year, it needed seven fermentation tanks, which were all made by themselves using waste box boards. The chair the director sits on is an old box used to load goods, and the boxes used to pack goods have become the file cabinets of the secretary and director. The five stoves used in the store were all made up of waste iron purchased.
    Because they save money everywhere, the administrative management fee dropped to 2,103 yuan in 1957, saving 1,400 yuan compared to 1956.
    The employees are not only good at saving various materials, but also good at saving labor time, thinking of the masses everywhere, and constantly improving their working methods.
    Last year, the director of the cooperative and the employee selling cloth jointly researched and created a "hand-cranked cloth rolling machine," and measured the length on the cloth roll, achieving both business inventory and working efficiency, which was more than doubled. The liquid commodity inventory measuring scale they created is suitable for the inventory work of oil, wine, sauce, and vinegar. For sporadic commodities, they are all "converted from whole to part, divided into jin and liang" in advance according to the habits of the masses. Every time driver Chen Ming goes out, he loads the goods the night before, and contacts the county and the purchasing staff. All goods are picked up and loaded and unloaded by himself, reducing the time wasted in waiting for the purchasing staff to load and unload the goods in the past, which doubled the driving efficiency and saved 2,172 yuan in freight throughout the year.
    Overcome all kinds of difficulties, everything is for production
    In order to develop mountainous areas and support production, last summer, the director of the cooperative and the statistician traveled for a month, stepping all over the five nearby mountains, and discovered 37 kinds of medicinal materials that were produced in large quantities, organizing many farmers to go up the mountains to dig medicine. In 1957, they purchased 110,000 jin of medicinal materials, increasing the income of farmers by more than 7,000 yuan, which played a significant role in solving the problems of food and production difficulties for farmers at that time. In 1957, they also took 903 yuan from the public welfare fund to lend to farmers in need to develop pig production and actively supplied piglets, enabling 90 households of farmers who could not afford to raise pigs to raise pigs. In order to increase fertilizer sources for farmers, all employees of the cooperative carry manure baskets all year round and put forward the slogan of not wasting "a drop of urine." Each employee bought a chamber pot to collect urine. In the past two years, a total of 800,000 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer have been sent to agricultural cooperatives, and they have been rated as a model unit for accumulating fertilizer in the whole township. In winter, they also widely organized sideline production such as weaving and hunting. In 1957, the total income increased by 34,000 yuan for farmers.
    In order to enable farmers to concentrate their efforts on production, they insisted on delivering goods all year round. They delivered goods in the snow, swam in the flood, and delivered goods at night during the busy farming season. Last spring, there was a foot of heavy snow near Zhangsanying, and the masses were stuck at home and could not get out. Party Branch Secretary Wang Huanqing took the lead in leading everyone to deliver goods to their doors in the snow. On the road, employees were often slipped and fell. He told the stories of revolutionary martyrs to educate everyone to regard delivering goods as a battle and persist until the final victory. Once, five people were delivering goods back and it was already late at night. They got lost in the mountains, and after being led down by someone, they still insisted on delivering goods with full enthusiasm until they returned half a month later when the snow melted. Another time, a mountain torrent broke out and the Yixun River bridge was washed away. The masses in Hedong could not come to Hexi to buy and sell. Employees Li Wenkui, Wang Zuozhou, and others took the initiative to deliver goods by swimming. During the ten-day flood, more than 500 jin of oil and salt and more than 100 pieces of production materials were delivered to the masses, and 7,000 jin of medicinal materials were purchased. The cooperative delivered goods 648 times throughout the year, with a total value of more than 11,000 yuan. This strong mass viewpoint deeply moved the masses. When they delivered goods, the masses strongly asked them to stay for dinner and praised them, saying: "Floods can't stop the supply and marketing cooperative, wind and snow can't stop the delivery of goods, as long as we need it, the supply and marketing cooperative will deliver everything."
    What is the key?
    The reason why the production increase and thrift campaign of this cooperative can be carried out so widely, deeply, and persistently is mainly because it has brought into play the leading role of the Party. Party committees at all levels often specifically pointed out working methods for them, and constantly checked their work; the superior business departments also strengthened their leadership over the production increase and thrift campaign. In particular, the Party branch, in its leadership over the enterprise, used the red line of political and ideological work to run through all economic activities, and conscientiously implemented the Party's policies and the working method of the mass line.
    At the beginning of the production increase and thrift campaign, the Party branch organized employees to study documents related to running enterprises diligently and thriftily, mobilized the masses to check losses and waste, and vigorously increased production and saved costs. At that time, many employees actively responded to the Party's call, but some people had various erroneous ideas. The leaders said that the cooperative was too wasteful. Some employees said behind their backs: "He hasn't been to the department store. The waste in the department store is even greater than this!" When salesperson Yin Qinglian saw a rope end, waste cardboard box, or broken piece of glass, he picked it up. The leaders praised him, but some people called him "Yin Xiaodian." In order to solve these ideological obstacles, the Party branch organized all employees to conduct special debates: (1) Should our cooperative implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily? (2) Can the cooperative increase production and save costs? (3) Is Yin Qinglian's approach correct? Through the debate, the employees' thinking became clear, and they all realized that in order to build socialism, it is necessary to run the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and everyone should learn from Yin Qinglian. On this basis, the Party branch immediately launched an inspection of losses and waste, and organized employees to report and inspect themselves, using facts to educate themselves. Subsequently, a commodity complaint exhibition was organized, displaying more than 70 kinds of damaged commodities, marking the original prices, writing brief explanations, and organizing employees to visit and discuss. This was a very profound education for the employees. Everyone actively checked their shortcomings and actively participated in the production increase and thrift campaign.
    Grasp both ends and lead the middle
    When the campaign initially started, the masses were very enthusiastic, but they suffered from a lack of ways to increase production and save money. After discovering this situation, the Party branch, in addition to the branch secretary and Party members and Youth League members first taking the lead in overcoming difficulties, also cultivated positive elements such as driver Chen Ming, watchman Bao Wenxiang, and salesperson Wu Guiyuan to set an example in their respective work. Then, the Party branch publicized and praised them in various occasions to establish a banner. As a result, those who thought there were no ways found ways, and those who thought it was difficult saw others doing it and did it themselves. But there were still some people who thought that "some people are advanced and some are backward, backward is always backward, and middle-of-the-road is always middle-of-the-road." They lacked confidence in striving for advancement. In order to break this idea, the Party branch focused on helping Wang Zuozhou, who was not active before. After more than half a year of cultivation, Wang Zuozhou was rated as an advanced worker. The employees saw that the backward could also be advanced, which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm. Therefore, all the employees learned from the advanced and caught up with the advanced. Many of those who were passive in their work in the past turned to be active, and the backward turned to be advanced. In 1957, all 30 employees of the cooperative created deeds of thrift.
    At the beginning of the production increase and thrift campaign, it was discovered that some people had bourgeois individualism, demanding wages and subsidies, and taking maintenance medicine even without any illness. In response to this situation, the Party branch organized the study of documents related to hard work and simplicity, called on employees to recall and compare, compared bitterness with farmers, and formulated living plans. The employees said: "When the supply and marketing cooperative was first established, we didn't earn wages and had to go home to eat. After the cooperative developed, we only earned dozens of jin of millet. Now it has been changed to a wage system, and there are various benefits. How can we forget the hard life in the past!" After such self-education, all employees clearly recognized the relationship between personal interests and national interests, and the proletarian ideology overcame capitalist ideology. Those who demanded subsidies no longer demanded them, those who shouted difficulties no longer shouted them, and some even had savings. Everyone became active in their work.
    Slogans every season, requirements for everything
    In leading the production increase and thrift campaign, the Party branch put forward combat slogans every season based on the problems existing in business operations and the focus of the campaign in each period. For example, the slogan for the third quarter of 1956 was "Reform storage and eliminate losses," and the slogan for the second quarter of 1957 was "Everyone picks up waste products and digs for treasures everywhere," and the slogan for the third quarter was "Waste products become finished products and cold goods become hot goods." Because the slogans were put forward realistically and vividly, the results achieved were very good.
    In various major economic activities, the branch put forward specific requirements for employees in everything. When purchasing scrap iron in the first quarter of 1957, each employee was required to purchase 500 jin in their spare time, and the result was 15,000 jin were completed. However, in the process of collecting scrap iron, some employees were not active in collecting other waste products. The branch promptly changed the requirement for each person to collect 500 jin of scrap iron to a requirement of 100 yuan. In this way, employees became active in all collection varieties. Later, it was discovered that employees were not active in supplying commodities. Although the masses had requests for exchange of goods, the employees were willing to bring cash to the countryside to purchase. After research, the branch changed it to a requirement of 200 yuan per person for purchase and sale. In this way, the enthusiasm of the employees was fully mobilized, and the purchase and sale requirements of the masses were met.
    The branch put forward the slogan "One trick per person" and mobilized everyone to contribute ideas. In 1957, a total of 215 rationalization proposals were put forward, and 171 were adopted. According to the employee's suggestions, Dayushu winemaking was successfully trial-produced, the working method of "business inventory without delaying the inventory" and self-made hand-cranked cloth rolling machines were created, and work efficiency was improved. In the past two years, the cooperative has also used methods such as organizing on-site visits to promote more than 20 advanced experiences.
    The Party branch also implemented monthly evaluation and quarterly awards, and the method of "one award for one thing," which greatly promoted the work enthusiasm of the original backward people. Wang Zuozhou, Wang Yaqi, Li Ruitian, and others were once depressed in their work, but now they have been rated as advanced workers. (Attached picture)

    “百项节约”——政治工作与经济工作统一的结晶
    ——介绍隆化县张三营供销社“百项节约”的经验
    中共河北省承德地委会
    河北省隆化县张三营供销社是1949年建立的。这个社有五个门市部，三十名职工，其中党员四名，团员七名，有二十九人是建国以后参加工作的。
    这个社在两年前，政治工作薄弱，社内损失浪费很大。仓库长期无人检查，糕点被鼠吃、虫咬、黑枣烂成泥，扫帚堆里老鼠絮了窝，鸡蛋损失了15％。两头骡子无人经心管理，成了“长期病号”。干部思想也比较混乱，有些人闹工薪、闹补助，工作不安心，而勤勤恳恳的人反受到某些人的讽刺。
    人人勤俭　事事勤俭  时时勤俭　处处勤俭
    1956年，这个社根据当地党委和上级社的指示，认真贯彻了“勤俭建社”的方针，整顿了党的基层组织，建立了单一支部，配备了专职支部书记，进一步加强了政治思想工作。尤其是经过整风运动，充分发动了群众，从而使这个社两年如一日地坚持开展了增产节约运动，树立了人人勤俭、事事勤俭、时时勤俭、处处勤俭的优良风气，创造了“百项节约”的模范事迹，给国家节约了七千五百二十九元的财富。乡总支部书记说：“现在我们的供销社和过去大不相同，过去是‘官字号’，现在是勤勤俭俭过日子的人家。”一提到供销社的勤俭，群众都称赞说：“人人搞节约，处处挖财宝；垃圾当金银，废品变玛瑙。不浪费半文钱，不糟踏一泡尿。人人克勤克俭，不怕艰苦风暴。”
    一切自己动手
    从1957年起，这个社一切装卸搬运、物品修配和简单的基本建设，完全是自己干的。去年全年职工自己动手装卸车一百六十多次，共四十万斤，没花一点装卸费。夏天伊逊河洪水暴发，桥被冲断了，各地来往的车辆都要摆渡，物资都是雇脚行搬运。而这个社的全体职工坚持自己扛运，洪水暴发三个月，坚持了三个月，没花一点钱。
    1957年，他们修了两间盐库，修了门市部的护墙板。院内的篮球架子是职工在业余时间用箱子板钉成的。一套防火设备也是职工用拣来的废品修配成的。
    去年收购了十一万斤药材，一切装卸、晾晒全是职工自己动手。他们还用废箱板修理窗户、做水桶，自己用锡焊油抽子。自己动手炒栗子，炒瓜子。炉篦子烧坏了利用废铁片自己做。车夫陈明自己修理大车、补里带、换滑杠。去年他们还用破麻袋片加工了二百多斤麻刀，满足了当地修建学校的紧急需要。因为他们一切都是自己干，群众称他们是“万事通”。
    千方百计降低商品损耗
    职工们创造了很多方法降低和消灭商品损耗。为了改变常年陈列商品退色变质的现象，他们每周更换一次陈列的商品。他们自己动手做了大批商品保管箱。副食品由混合保管改为分类包管。凡是怕虫咬、鼠吃的商品，全部悬挂起来，怕潮的全部腾空保管。怕折腾的商品实行“一次包装”。1957年商品损耗由千分之三降到千分之零点九。为了减少损失，增加社里收入，职工们处处动脑筋。大桶煤油用抽子抽不净，他们用木棍缠上破布条擦油桶，一年擦出三十多斤油。包糖的竹叶，都攒起来，从竹叶子上熬出二斤糖。二千二百个面袋里扫出了五十多斤面粉。1955年社里卖粉条时出了三十多斤碎粉头，风吹日晒粘了很多土，每斤由四角六降到一角钱还没有人买。副食部刘发同志把粉条洗干净，用油炸了，然后用卖糖球剩下的渣子熬浆，把粉头制成点心，起名叫“粉头糕”，香甜清脆，几天就卖完了。
    爱社如家
    张三营供销社职工从上到下都是勤勤恳恳爱社如家。他们对社内的一切物品，像忠诚勤朴的家庭主妇那样的经心。油灯上的罩子都做了“保险架”。支部书记无意中碰打了一个茶碗，立即赔了新的。尹庆连业余时间给学校割玻璃所得报酬十一元多钱，全部交给了社。车夫陈明每次出车，在路上遇到石头总要先用脚踢开，有小坑都是先填平或者绕过去，出车回来不论多累，总是拉着牲口蹓一趟；夜间喂牲口经常喂到三点多钟。别人问他为什么不早睡，他说：“马不得夜草不肥，陪着是我的本分。”因此去年三匹牲口都没出毛病，药费比过去下降了三分之二。群众说：“连供销社的车夫都爱马如命”。
    人人找窍门，废品变财宝
    职工们个个争先找增产节约的窍门和积攒废品。一切用过的包装纸、纸盒、绳头、钉子，都抢着拣起来。宰羊按老规矩是不要羊尿胞心的，他们却从羊尿胞心上刮了三十多斤油。为了节约用煤，去年他们把烧过的煤灰全筛一遍，一年筛出煤核九百四十斤，炭末八百多斤。他们看到农民把大头菜根全扔掉，觉得很可惜，就收购了五百斤，剥了皮和其他菜掺在一起做成小菜出售，起名叫“赛锦州”，很受群众欢迎。更动人的是职工从屠宰的一千八百只鸡嗉子里扒出一百六十斤粮食，解决了一千多只鸡的饲料问题。这件事传出后，农民给编了个快板：“供销社真可夸，死鸡身上把财发；鸡嗉里扒粮食，人人听了都惊讶！”
    少花钱多办事　不花钱也办事
    职工们处处精打细算，不肯浪费一文钱。他们充分利用废纸包装货物，九个月没买包装纸和办公纸，四个多月没买一点办公用品。门市部从来不买新笔尖，会计使剩下的磨磨再用。一支复写笔一直使了八年，现在仍然用着。保管账和卡片都是自己印，从不找印刷厂。去年用的四十多包火柴都是用积攒骨头的钱买的。大车跑隆化，一年四季总是自带草料，不在店里买。鞭子用的鞭梢是废皮子，缰绳是利用旧物编的。职工宿舍利用旧蒲包做炕席。为节约纸绳，捆钱用破布条，交款后还带回来，常年使用。县里规定的电话旬报，他们总是提前作表，由大车或找便人捎去，一年节约电话费六十元。炊事员高永生每次做完饭后，用余火温水制碱，去年用这个办法制了一万多斤碱，节省了大量燃料。
    去年社里试制大玉术酒时，需要七个发酵池，都是他们利用废箱板自己做的。主任坐的凳子是装货用过的旧箱子，包装货物用过的箱子又当了书记、主任的文件橱。门市部用的五个火炉子，都是用收购的废铁凑成的。
    由于他们处处节约，1957年行政管理费降到二千一百零三元，比1956年节约一千四百元。
    职工们不仅善于节约各种物资，而且善于节约劳动时间，处处为群众着想，不断地改进工作方法。
    去年社主任与卖布的职工，共同研究创造了“手摇卷布机”，并在布卷上计尺，做到了营业盘点两不误，工作效率提高了一倍以上。他们创造的液体商品盘点计量尺，适用于油、酒、酱、醋的盘点工作。对零星商品，都根据群众习惯，事先“化整为零，分斤劈两”。车夫陈明每次出车都是前一天晚上就装好，到县和采购员联系好，一切货物都是自己去各处提取和装卸，减去了过去装卸货物都等采购员而浪费的时间，使行车效率提高了一倍，全年节约了二千一百七十二元运费。
    克服各种困难　一切为了生产
    为了开发山区，支援生产，去年夏天，社主任和统计员戴月披星奔走了一个月，踏遍了附近五座大山，发现了三十七种大量出产的药材，组织了很多农民上山挖药。1957年收购了十一万斤药材，给农民增加了七千多元的收入，对解决当时农民吃粮和生产困难起了重大作用。1957年，他们还从公益金中提出九百零三元借给农民中的困难户，发展生猪生产，并积极供应仔猪，使九十户无力养猪的农民养上了猪。为给农民增加肥源，全社职工常年背粪筐，并提出不糟踏“一泡尿”的口号，每个职工都买了夜壶攒尿。两年来共送给农业社八十万斤杂肥，被评为全乡积肥模范单位。冬季，他们又广泛组织编织、打猎等副业生产。1957年，共计给农民增加收入三万四千元。
    为使农民集中力量搞好生产，他们坚持常年送货。下雪就冒雪送，洪水暴发就泅水送，农忙就夜间送。去年春天，张三营附近下了一尺深的大雪，群众堵在家里出不来。党支部书记王焕卿带头领着大家踏雪送货到门。在路上职工时常被滑倒，他就讲革命烈士的事迹，教育大家把送货当作战斗，坚持到最后胜利。有一次五个人送货回来已到深夜，在山上迷了路，被人领下后，仍一直情绪饱满地坚持送货，直到半个月后雪化了才回来。又有一次，山洪暴发，伊逊河桥被冲断，河东的群众不能到河西来买卖，职工李文魁、王作舟等就主动地泅水送货。在十多天的洪水期间，给群众送去油盐五百多斤，生产资料一百多件，收购药材七千斤。这个社全年送货达六百四十八次，以款计算达一万一千多元。这种坚强的群众观点，深深感动了群众，在他们送货时群众都强留吃饭，并称赞他们说：“洪水阻不住供销社，风雪挡不住送货挑，只要是我们需要的，供销社样样都送到。”
    关键何在？
    这个社的增产节约运动所以能够开展得那样广泛、深入、持久，主要是发挥了党的领导作用。各级党委经常具体地指给他们工作方法，并对他们的工作不断地进行检查；上级业务部门，也加强了对增产节约运动的领导。特别是党支部在对企业的领导中，用政治思想工作的红线，贯串在全部经济活动之中，认真地贯彻执行了党的方针政策和群众路线的工作方法。
    在增产节约运动开始时，党支部组织职工学习了有关勤俭办企业的文件，发动群众检查损失浪费，厉行增产节约。当时，许多职工积极地响应了党的号召，但也有些人存在着各种各样的错误思想。领导上说，社里浪费太大。有的职工在背后却说：“他没到百货公司去，百货公司的浪费比这还大呢！”营业员尹庆连见到一根绳头、废纸盒、碎玻璃片都拾起来，领导上表扬了他，但有的人却管他叫“尹小店”。党支部为解决这些思想障碍，组织全体职工进行了专题辩论：（1）我们社应该不应该贯彻勤俭办社的方针？（2）社内能不能增产节约？（3）尹庆连的作法对不对？通过辩论，职工的思想明确了，都认识到为了建设社会主义，必须勤俭办社，人人都应该学习尹庆连。在这个基础上，党支部立即开展了对损失浪费的检查，并组织职工自报自查，用事实来教育自己。随后组织了一个商品诉苦展览会，展出七十多种残损商品，标出原价，写出扼要说明，组织职工参观，并进行了讨论。这对职工的教育是很深刻的，大家都主动检查了自己的缺点，积极地投入了增产节约运动。
    抓两头　带中间
    在运动初步开展起来的时候，群众热情很高，但苦于没有增产节约门路。党支部发现这种情况后，除由支部书记和党员、团员首先动手动脑，带头克服困难以外，还培养了车夫陈明、更夫鲍文祥和营业员武桂元等积极分子，在各自的工作中作出样子。然后，党支部就在各种场合进行宣传表扬，树立旗帜。这样一来，认为没有门路的找到了门路，认为困难的，见到别人做，自己也作了。但还有一些人认为“人有先进有落后，落后总是落后，中流就是中流”。对争取先进缺乏信心。为打破这种思想，党支部重点帮助了原来不积极的王作舟，经半年多的培养，王作舟被评为先进工作者。职工看到落后的也能先进，大大鼓舞了干劲。因而，全体职工个个学先进、赶先进，不少过去工作消极的转为积极，落后的转为先进。1957年，全社三十名职工，人人都创造了节约事迹。
    在开展增产节约运动之初，发现有些人存在着资产阶级个人主义思想，闹工薪、闹补助，没有什么病也吃保养药。党支部针对这种情况就组织学习了有关艰苦朴素方面的文件，号召职工回忆对比，与农民比苦，制定生活计划。职工说：“供销社刚建立时，不挣工资，还得回家吃饭，合作社发展后才挣几十斤小米，现在改为工资制，还有各项福利，我们怎能忘记过去的艰苦生活！”经过这样自我教育后，全体职工明确认识了个人利益与国家利益的关系，无产阶级思想战胜了资本主义思想。要求补助的不要了，喊困难的也不喊了，有的还有了节余，大家工作都积极起来。
    季季有口号，事事有要求
    在领导增产节约运动中，党支部根据各个时期业务经营中存在的问题与运动的重点，季季提出战斗口号。如1956年第三季度是“改革保管，杜绝损耗”，1957年第二季度是“人人拣废品，处处挖财宝”，第三季度是“废品变成品，冷货变热货”。由于口号提得切实生动，实现的结果很好。
    在各种主要经济活动中，支部对职工事事提出具体要求。1957年第一季度收购废铁时，要求每个职工用业余时间收购五百斤，结果完成了一万五千斤。但在收废铁过程中，有的职工对收购其他废品不积极，支部便及时把每人收购五百斤废铁的要求改为一百元的要求，这样，职工便对所有收购品种都积极了。后来又发现职工对供应商品不积极，虽然群众有换货要求，但职工都愿意带现钱下乡收购。支部研究后，又改为每人购销二百元的要求。这样便全面调动起职工的积极性，满足了群众的购销要求。
    支部提出“一人一窍”的口号，发动大家献计。1957年共提出合理化建议二百一十五件。采纳一百七十一件。根据职工的献计，试制成功了大玉术酿酒，创造了“营业盘点两不误”的工作方法和自制手摇卷布机等，提高了工作效率。两年来，这个社还用组织现场参观等办法，推广了二十多项先进经验。
    党支部还实行了月评季奖，和“一事一奖”的办法。大大促进了原来落后的人的工作积极性。王作舟、王雅齐、李瑞田等人过去工作消沉，现已被评为先进工作者。（附图片）
