    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 20th – Yinchuan City, the capital of the soon-to-be-established Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is receiving cadres and engineering technicians of various ethnic groups from all over the country every day. Various materials supporting the construction of the Ningxia region are also being transported in a continuous stream.
    Up to now, more than two thousand cadres and technical personnel have come to the Ningxia region to participate in construction. They come from more than 20 provinces and cities across the country, some from the capital, Beijing, and some from the northernmost Heilongjiang and the southernmost Guangdong and Yunnan. Among them are many outstanding Hui and Han leading cadres, senior and mid-level engineering technicians, medical workers, and literary and art workers, as well as construction workers and young students.
    Many of the personnel who come to participate in work and construction bring their families with them, preparing to settle down here for a long time. Many people, after a long journey, covered in dust, immediately requested to be assigned to new positions after arriving at their destination. More than 500 middle school students from Beijing, after a short period of study in Yinchuan City, were mostly assigned to rural areas to serve as primary school teachers and have become active figures on the cultural revolution front in the countryside. More than 700 construction cadres and workers transferred from Gansu Province are now undertaking basic construction and urban construction tasks. More than 100 literary and art workers transferred from the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Cultural Troupe of the Railway Soldiers have formed the Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe, which has already performed many wonderful programs for audiences of all ethnic groups. Nearly a thousand educated youth from Shanghai have also set off to participate in various construction projects here.
    The Ningxia region has already begun to prepare for the construction of a number of relatively large factories and mines, and to build some large-scale water conservancy projects. Nearly a thousand tons of steel, cement, wood, and electrical equipment supporting these factories and mines and construction projects from Northeast China, Hebei, Shanghai, Tianjin, Lanzhou, and other places have been transported; Qingdao, Baotou, Henan, and other places are also rushing to manufacture factory machinery and equipment for the Ningxia region. At the same time, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and other departments, as well as the Baotou Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, have sent working groups to help the Ningxia region survey factory sites and design factories.

    全国各地热情支援宁夏地区
    数千名干部和技术人员前往参加各项建设
    新华社银川20日电　即将成立的宁夏回族自治区的首府——银川市，每天都在接待来自全国各地的各民族干部和工程技术人员。支援宁夏地区建设的各种物资，也源源运来。
    到目前为止，来宁夏地区参加建设的干部和技术人员已有两千多名，他们来自全国二十多个省、市，有的来自首都北京，有的来自祖国最北方的黑龙江和最南方的广东、云南。他们当中有许多优秀的回、汉族领导干部，有高级和中级的工程技术人员、医务工作者和文艺工作者，有建筑工人和青年学生。
    前来参加工作和建设的人员，有很多人都把家眷带到这里，准备长期安家。许多人经过长途跋涉，风尘仆仆，一到达目的地以后，立即要求分配到新岗位上去工作。从北京来的五百多名中学生，到银川市经过了很短时间的学习，多数被分配到农村中担任小学教师，已成为农村中文化革命战线上的活跃人物。从甘肃省调来的七百多名建筑干部和工人，现在已经担负起基本建设和城市建设的任务。由中央实验歌剧院、中央歌舞团、中国杂技团、中国人民解放军空军政治部文工团和铁道兵文工团调来的一百多名文艺工作者，组成了自治区歌舞团，已经给各族观众演出许多精采的节目。近千名上海的知识青年也已动身，到这里参加各项建设。
    宁夏地区目前已经开始筹建一批比较大的厂矿，兴建一些大型的水利工程。从东北、河北、上海、天津、兰州等地支援这些厂矿和建设工程的钢材、水泥、木材和电机设备，已经运到了近千吨；青岛、包头和河南等地还正在为宁夏地区赶制工厂机器设备。同时，冶金工业部、轻工业部等和包头黑色冶金设计院都已派来工作组，帮助宁夏地区勘测厂址和进行工厂的设计。（附图片）
