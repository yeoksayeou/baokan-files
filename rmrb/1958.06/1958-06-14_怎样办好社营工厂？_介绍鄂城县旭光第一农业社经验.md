How to Run a Commune-Operated Factory Well?
    ——Introducing the Experience of the Xuguang First Agricultural Cooperative in Echeng County
    Feng Jian

    After agricultural cooperatives set up small factories, how can they be managed well? The Xuguang First Agricultural Cooperative in Echeng County, Hubei Province, has already provided some good experiences.

    In the spring of this year, the Xuguang First Agricultural Cooperative did not ask the state for money, people, or machines. Instead, it used simple and local methods to set up three factories (granular fertilizer factory, farm tool manufacturing factory, and agricultural product joint processing factory) and five stations (agricultural machinery station, transportation station, biogas power generation station, health and medical station, and industrial and agricultural scientific research station) in just over a month. These factories and stations have already produced 50,000 jin of granular fertilizer, manufactured and repaired more than 400 various farm tools and implements. The joint processing factory has also started grinding flour. This year, the agricultural and sideline production value of the Xuguang First Cooperative has increased nearly twofold compared to last year, resulting in a shortage of more than 50,000 labor days. However, after setting up the three factories and five stations, there is no longer a shortage of labor.

    After setting up the three factories and five stations, the Party branch and management committee of the Xuguang First Cooperative divided the entire cooperative into four fronts: agriculture, enterprise, industry, and finance. Each front is led by a deputy director, and the cooperative director oversees all the work. Therefore, the entire cooperative focuses on agricultural production, ensuring that everything is managed and everything is arranged. Subsequently, based on the needs of agricultural production, the cooperative formulated this year's production plans for each factory and station, and in accordance with the agricultural seasons, set out phased tasks and requirements for execution. For example, during the intense summer harvest season, the Xuguang First Cooperative proposed to "rush harvest, rush threshing, fast transportation, and fast storage." The farm tool factory repaired and manufactured more than 300 sickles and hoes three days in advance, repaired and installed more than 70 sprayers, cultivators, and safe automatic spray vehicles, and also organized a repair team to repair farm tools in the fields. The agricultural machinery station ensured the rapid completion of wheat threshing within ten days. The fertilizer factory rushed to produce granular fertilizer to ensure that each mu of cotton field received 50 jin of topdressing fertilizer during the budding period. The processing factory processed flour for the cooperative members day and night. The production of each factory and station closely cooperated with the production needs of the summer harvest season.

    The cadres and workers of each factory and station of the Xuguang First Cooperative are both workers and farmers. They describe themselves as "covered in yellow mud when working in the fields, and covered in oil sludge when working in the factory." The factory directors of the fertilizer factory, farm tool factory, and joint processing factory have all learned several production skills and work the same as the workers. The workers of each factory are also farmers when they are in the fields and workers when they are in the factory. The agricultural cooperative also prioritizes the needs of agricultural production when arranging production and labor. When transplanting rice is busy, most of the workers in each factory go to the fields to transplant rice. After the rice transplanting season, they return to the factory for production. The wages of the workers in each factory and station, except for a few tractor drivers who are assigned to the agricultural cooperative and are paid monthly wages, are calculated using the same work point system as the farmers and participate in the same distribution. For example, the work of the pump operator is fixed, so a long-term contract work method is adopted. The products of the granular fertilizer factory are fixed, so piece-rate wages are implemented. The farm tool factory and joint processing factory implement work point recording by grade and time. The work points of these factories are no higher than the income of the members of the agricultural cooperative, nor are they lower than the income of the members. Therefore, both the workers and the members are satisfied.

    The management committee of the Xuguang First Cooperative believes that the factories and stations in the cooperative must have rural systems and cannot simply copy the systems of large factories. Therefore, they studied and established a set of simple and easy-to-implement systems suitable for rural areas and agricultural production. The production time of each factory and station is exactly the same as agricultural production. Problems are solved whenever they arise, rather than stipulating an eight-hour working day. The welfare and labor protection of the workers are the same as that of the agricultural cooperative members, except for the necessary gloves, which are provided by the agricultural cooperative. The leading cadres of each factory and station participate in the management committee of the agricultural cooperative to understand the production plans of the agricultural cooperative at each stage, listen to the opinions of the members, and arrange and improve the work of the factories and stations. The product inspection, material warehousing, and material requisition systems established by each factory and station are also simple and easy to implement.

    In the past month, the factories and stations of the Xuguang First Cooperative have truly played a role in promoting agricultural production. Therefore, the members praised their factories, saying: "The processing factory is busy day and night, the motorized mill is rumbling, grinding fine flour like white sugar, saving more than 10,000 labor days." "The fertilizer factory is working day and night, making 50,000 jin of fertilizer before budding, ensuring increased production of cotton and wheat."

    怎样办好社营工厂？
    ——介绍鄂城县旭光第一农业社经验
    逢剑
    农业合作社办起小型工厂之后，怎样才能管理得好？湖北鄂城县旭光第一农业社已经提供了一些良好的经验。
    旭光第一农业社在今年春季，没有伸手向国家要钱、要人、要机器，在一个多月内用穷办法、土办法办起了三厂（颗粒肥料厂、农具制造厂、农产品联合加工厂）、五站（农业机械站、交通运输站、沼气发电站、卫生保健站、工农业科学研究站），这些厂、站已经制造了五万斤颗粒肥料，制造和修理了四百多件各种农具、工具。联合加工厂也开始磨面。旭光一社今年由于农副业产值比去年增加将近两倍，缺少五万多个劳动日，办起了三厂、五站后，劳动力不缺了。
    旭光一社在办起了三厂、五站后，社里的党支部和管理委员会把全社划分为农业、企业、工业、财经四条战线，每条战线有一个副主任领导，社主任掌握全盘工作；因此全社以农业生产为主，作到了事事有人管，件件有安排。接着，这个社根据农业生产需要，制订了各厂、站今年的生产计划，并按照农时季节，订出分段执行的任务和要求。例如在紧张的夏收季节里，旭光一社提出抢收、抢打、快运、快藏，农具厂就提前三天修理、制造了三百多张镰刀、锄头，修理、安装了七十多部喷雾器、中耕器和安全自动喷雾车，还组织了修配小组，巡回田间修理农具；农业机械站保证在十天内突击完成小麦脱粒；肥料厂赶制了颗粒肥料，保证每亩棉田追蕾肥期间施足五十斤；加工厂则日夜为社员加工面粉；各厂、站的生产紧紧地配合了夏收季节的生产需要。
    旭光一社各厂、站的干部、工人，都是亦工亦农，他们形容自己是“下田一身黄泥，进厂双手油泥。”肥料厂、农具厂和联合加工厂的厂长，都学会了几种生产技能，和工人同样劳动；各厂的工人，也是下田就是农民，进厂就是工人。农业社在安排生产和劳动力时，也都服从农业生产的需要。插秧忙时，各厂的工人，大都下田插秧，过了插秧季节，又回到工厂生产。各厂、站工人的工资，除了少数下放到农业社的拖拉机手是按月工资制以外，都是按照农业社记工分的办法和农民同样参加分配。如抽水机手的工作固定，就采取常年包工的办法；颗粒肥料厂的产品固定，就实行按件计酬；农具厂和联合加工厂实行按级按时记工等；这些工厂的工分不过高于农业社社员的收入，也不低于社员的收入。因此，工人和社员们都满意。
    旭光一社管理委员会认为，社里的厂、站必须有农村的制度，不能搬用大厂的制度，因而研究建立了一套简便易行、适用于农村和农业生产的制度。各厂、站的生产时间完全和农业生产一样，什么时候有问题，就什么时候解决，而不是规定八小时工作制。工人的福利和劳动保护除了必需的手套由农业社发给外，其他和农业社员一样。各厂、站的领导干部都参加农业社的管理委员会，了解农业社每一阶段的生产计划，听取社员的意见，布置和改进厂、站的工作；各厂、站订出的产品检验、材料入库、领料等制度，也是简单易行的。
    旭光一社的厂、站，一个多月来，对农业生产真正起到了推动作用，因此，社员们歌颂自己的工厂说：“加工厂，日夜忙，机动磨，轰隆响，磨的细面像白糖，节约劳力一万多。”“肥料厂，日夜干，蕾前造肥要五万，保证棉麦增了产。”
