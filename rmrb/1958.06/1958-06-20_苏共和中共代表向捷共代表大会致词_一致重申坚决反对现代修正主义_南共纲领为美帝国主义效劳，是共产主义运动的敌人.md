Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 19th: The Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party continued its discussion of the Central Committee's report on the 19th.

In the morning session, seven delegates spoke in the discussion. Among them were machine workers, miners, agricultural cooperative members, and party workers. They all talked about the situations and experiences in their work, and they all particularly emphasized the need to strengthen ideological and cultural work, strengthen care for people, and strengthen education for young people.

At around 10:20 a.m., a large group of Young Pioneers, carrying flowers, holding flags, and bringing musical instruments, entered the venue to express their gratitude and congratulations to the Communist Party, which had shown them great care. Suddenly, the venue was filled with a lively and joyful atmosphere.

大会主席杜兰斯基代表党向少先队员们致词，勉励少先队员们时刻准备着建设祖国。
After a break, Kirichenko, head of the Soviet Communist Party delegation and member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a long congratulatory speech to the Congress.

In his congratulatory speech, he expressed warm congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people. He then talked about the international significance of Czechoslovakia's achievements in various fields over the past few years. He also highly praised Czechoslovakia's achievements and role in domestic economic construction, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the domestic united front, and praised the strong leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Novotny.

When talking about the current international situation, Kirichenko once again stated the firm position of the Soviet Communist Party against modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav communists. He pointed out that imperialism is trying to undermine our unity from within, and the Yugoslav Communist program is a revisionist program against the unity of communist parties of all countries and socialist countries, and is an enemy of the communist movement. He said that Comrade Khrushchev has already expressed the Soviet Communist Party's attitude towards Yugoslav revisionism very well at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

Comrade Kirichenko's speech was interrupted by warm applause from time to time. The entire audience repeatedly stood up and cheered enthusiastically for a long time: "Long live the Soviet Union!"

The morning session also read a congratulatory telegram from the American Communist Party signed by General Secretary Dennis.

In the afternoon session, Dong Biwu, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee to the Congress. He expressed warm congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. He gave a high evaluation of Czechoslovakia's achievements in socialist construction and peaceful diplomatic policies. Dong Biwu then talked about the current international situation, saying that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and will continue to prevail over the West wind. However, imperialism is still continuing to make war threats, and we must maintain high vigilance. He emphasized that the Yugoslav Communist program was proposed to split the international communist movement and serves imperialism, especially American imperialism. We must resolutely smash this modern revisionism that serves the policies of American imperialism. His words were warmly welcomed by the delegates and guests.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 18th: At the afternoon session of the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party today, Štitka, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Inspection Committee, delivered a report. He summarized the work of the committee since the last Congress and put forward future tasks.

The Congress then began to discuss the report of Novotny, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee. This afternoon, three representatives of local party organizations reported to the Congress on the work achievements of their respective regions or units.

Hrebecek, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Košice Region, the center of the Czechoslovak metallurgical industry, spoke about the surging production enthusiasm of the working people in this region, inspired by the general line of socialist construction. While introducing the situation in which the people of this region are launching a struggle against revisionism in accordance with Marxist-Leninist doctrines, he pointed out that the workers are united in condemning the revisionism of the Yugoslav communist leadership group.

Bilak, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Prešov Region in Slovakia, described the unprecedented development and changes in the formerly very backward Prešov Region under the shining light of the Marxist-Leninist national policy.

Subsequently, Slezachta, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, Projhaka, Chairman of the People's Party, Kisel, Chairman of the Slovak Revival Party, and Žakovič, Chairman of the Slovak Freedom Party, spoke at the meeting one after another, warmly congratulating the Congress. They expressed their determination to move forward together under the strong leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.
