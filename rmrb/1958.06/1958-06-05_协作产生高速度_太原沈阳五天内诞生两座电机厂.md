Collaboration Generates High Speed
    Taiyuan and Shenyang Give Birth to Two Motor Factories in Five Days

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th: More than twenty factories and mines in Taiyuan City collaborated to build a motor factory with an annual production capacity of 50,000 kilowatts in seventy hours. The first "Collaboration Brand" motor produced by this factory was also born at the same time.

    If the past method had been used to build such a motor factory, it would have required at least 3.5 million yuan in investment and a year of time; but as a result of concerted cooperation, only a few hundred yuan were spent on adding some scattered tools, and it was built in less than three days.

    The motor industry in the Taiyuan area was originally relatively weak. Since the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the demand for developing power machinery has become even more urgent. On May 30, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee plenary meeting decided to build a motor factory within seven days through the method of old factories leading new factories and parent factories leading subsidiary factories. This resolution was immediately warmly responded to by various factories and mines. The factory construction plan was put forward in one day. Jinxi Machine Factory acted as the parent factory, providing the new factory with the main equipment and tools for making motors, and also undertaking the training of workers, test runs, and process arrangements; Fenxi Machine Factory vacated workers' dormitories overnight to be used as factory buildings; workers from the Fourth Engineering Office of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau helped the new factory renovate factory buildings and install equipment through voluntary labor; Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory and Shanxi Machine Tool Factory transferred some special equipment. Many local state-owned factories also supplied materials such as wood and cement with the same spirit of cooperation.

    While providing equipment, Jinxi Machine Factory sent engineers and technicians to guide the new factory workers in their operations. They brought their own factory's tools and semi-finished products to teach and work on the new factory's machines. Therefore, the first motor was produced at the same time as the new factory was built. The motors produced by this factory this year can supply power to more than 11,000 ordinary water pumps in rural areas.

    This newspaper reports: Nineteen factories in Shenyang City used the method of socialist great collaboration to establish a motor manufacturing factory in five days without state investment. The maximum annual output of this factory can reach 720,000 kilowatts.

    A large number of reservoirs and dams have been built in the vast rural areas of Liaoning Province. Due to the lack of sufficient generators, hydropower stations cannot be built quickly; the state now needs to produce a large number of complete sets of fertilizer, iron-smelting, oil refining equipment, and large water pumps, large fans, etc., all of which require a large number of motors. However, building a new motor manufacturing factory not only requires a large amount of investment, but also cannot solve the current urgent needs. To this end, the Shenyang area production coordination meeting specifically discussed this issue. Eighteen units, including Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, unanimously proposed that they would rather do less in their own enterprises and draw money out to be used as the construction funds for the motor manufacturing factory. Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory donated idle cranes and other equipment. Northeast Institute of Technology sent professors and lecturers to serve as the factory's chief engineer and chief designer, and was responsible for everything from product design and process development to technical problems in daily production. Shenyang Electrical Manufacturing Factory and others also supported the new factory with a large number of technicians, managers, and equipment.

### 协作产生高速度  太原沈阳五天内诞生两座电机厂

　　协作产生高速度
    太原沈阳五天内诞生两座电机厂
    据新华社太原4日电　太原市二十多个厂矿企业在七十小时内协作建成了一座年产能力五万瓩的电机厂。由这个厂生产的第一台“协作牌”电动机也同时诞生。
    如果用过去的作法建成这样一座电机厂，至少要三百五十万元投资和一年的时间；而通力协作的结果，只用几百元增添一些零星工具，不到三天就建成了。
    太原地区的电机工业原来比较薄弱，工农业大跃进以来，发展动力机械的要求更加迫切。5月30日中共太原市委全体会议决议，通过老厂带新厂、母厂带子厂的办法，在七天内建成一座电机厂。这个决议立即得到各厂矿的热烈响应。建厂方案在一天内就提出来了。晋西机器厂充当母厂，除供给新厂制作电机的主要设备、工具以外，还承担训练工人、试车、工艺安排工作；汾西机器厂连夜腾出职工宿舍当厂房；太原工程局第四工程处职工用义务劳动帮助新厂整修厂房安装设备；太原重型机器厂、山西机床厂调出一些特殊设备。还有许多地方国营厂也以同样的协作精神，供给木料、水泥等器材。
    晋西机器厂在支援设备的同时，就派出工程师和技术工人指导新厂工人操作。他们带上自己工厂的工具和半成品，在新厂的机床上边教边作。因此在新厂建成的同时，就生产出了第一台电动机。这个厂今年生产的电动机可以供农村带动一万一千多部普通水泵。
    本报讯　沈阳市十九个工厂用社会主义大协作的方法，不用国家投资，五天筹办成一座电机制造厂。这个厂最高年产量可达七十二万瓩。
    辽宁省广大农村已建成了大量的水库和拦河坝，由于没有足够的发电机，不能迅速建设水电站；国家现在要大量生产全套的化肥、炼铁、炼油设备和大型水泵、大型扇风机等均需要大量电动机。但是，新建一座电机制造厂不仅需要大量投资，而且不能解决当前的急需。为此，沈阳地区生产协作会议专门讨论了这一问题。沈阳风动工具厂等十八个单位一致提出宁肯本企业少办一些事，也要抽出钱来，做为电机制造厂的建厂资金。沈阳高压开关厂把闲置的吊车等设备献了出来。东北工学院派教授和讲师兼任该工厂的总工程师和总设计师，并从产品设计、编制工艺到日常生产中的技术问题，负责到底。沈阳市电器制造厂等也以大量的技术工人、管理人员和设备支援了这个新工厂。
