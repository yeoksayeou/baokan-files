Getting Rid of the Four Pests Even During the Busy Farming Season
Jiang Hao

Summer is the season when the four pests, especially mosquitoes and flies, breed in large numbers. The agricultural work is also very intense. Various places have encountered many new difficulties in carrying out the campaign to eliminate the four pests. Some people's understanding of whether to engage in eliminating the four pests in summer and autumn, and how to do it if it is to be done, is vague. Therefore, some people abandon the leadership of eliminating the four pests when the farming season arrives, waiting for autumn to start again; some people have not made up their minds about eliminating the four pests at present and are still standing there watching; and some places, although continuing to eliminate the four pests, hinder production and affect the enthusiasm of the masses because they adopt the same methods of launching surprise high tides as in winter and spring, causing the movement to stagnate.

The main thing that should be resolved here is the relationship between eliminating the four pests and production. It should be further clarified that carrying out the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests is to serve production, and doing a good job in eliminating the four pests is an important condition for ensuring the development of production.

In recent years, due to the development of the patriotic health movement, a large number of four pests have been eliminated. People have gradually created conditions for controlling infectious diseases, so that the incidence of diseases has continued to decline and the attendance rate has continued to increase. The positive role it has played in promoting production can be clearly seen in almost every agricultural cooperative. In rural areas, vivid slogans such as "Cleaning up and accumulating manure can lead to more grain, eliminating diseases and ensuring health," and "Eliminating the four pests reduces diseases, and guarantees production development" are spreading everywhere.

Some people say, "We are not against eliminating the four pests, but what's wrong with dropping it for a few months and eliminating it again in the autumn!" These people don't know that eliminating the four pests is fighting against nature. We should have an enemy perspective and vigilance when dealing with the four pests. At present, the four pests, especially mosquitoes and flies, are breeding in large numbers every day and every hour. One more mosquito or fly will spread more germs to people. As long as the four pests exist, there is a risk of being infected with diseases. Root out the evil! We must not be complacent about the four pests. Although they breed in large numbers now, they are easily exposed and their lives are fragile. It is more convenient to eliminate them now than in winter and spring. We should seize the opportunity.

In summer and autumn, eliminating the four pests is more difficult than in winter and spring due to the limitations of time and manpower. But even though it is busy, it is not as busy as those who are in a mood of ceasefire say, without any gaps at all. The biggest feature of summer and autumn farming is its strong seasonality. One farming task follows another, or two farming tasks are carried out simultaneously. The mobilization of labor is wide and very concentrated. At the busiest time of harvesting or sowing, even some old grandmothers and children have to participate in field labor in areas where labor is scarce. But despite this, it is not the same busy every day. According to the situation in many areas, regardless of whether the farming season comes early or late, each season is divided into several stages, and in the middle of each stage and between stages, there are three or five days, seven or eight days, or even longer gaps. Agricultural production itself has a rhythm. Therefore, according to the rhythm of agricultural production, grasping the gaps in agricultural work and arranging some short-term surprise activities to eliminate the four pests is still conditional and guaranteed.

In addition to some surprise activities, many regular activities to eliminate the four pests can also be arranged in conjunction with many projects of summer and autumn agricultural production and the production organization of agricultural cooperatives. For example, manure accumulation and irrigation can be combined to eliminate the breeding conditions of mosquitoes and flies; scraping grass to accumulate manure can be combined to kill snails; fertilizing mulberry trees can be combined with rat extermination; locust and borer extermination can be combined with mosquito, fly, and snail extermination; cleaners and breeders can contract to handle human and animal manure, etc. For example, cleaning indoors and outdoors every morning and evening, as long as you are diligent and develop a habit of cleanliness, you can solve the problem by taking advantage of a few minutes of free time before going to the fields or after returning home.

In short, although the specific conditions in various places are different, as long as we pay attention to studying the characteristics of the local agricultural season, grasp its laws, and closely implement the spirit of eliminating the four pests to serve production, obeying production and combining with production, specifically organize various surprise and regular activities to eliminate the four pests, and mobilize the masses, we can ensure both the in-depth development of the movement to eliminate the four pests and ensure that the current production tasks are not affected.

### 农忙季节也能除四害

    农忙季节也能除四害
    江浩
    夏季是四害特别是蚊蝇大量繁殖的季节，农事又很紧张，各地在开展除四害运动的过程中，也遇到了许多新的困难。对夏秋季该不该搞除四害，要除又如何搞法等问题有些人的认识是模糊的。因此，有人到了农忙，就放弃了除四害的领导，偃旗息鼓，等待秋后再搞；有人对目前除四害没打定主意，还停住脚在那里观望；而有的地方，虽然继续在除四害，又因为他们采取冬春那一套搞突击高潮的办法，妨碍了生产，影响了群众的积极性，使运动停滞了下来。
    这里主要应该解决的是除四害与生产的关系问题。应该进一步明确，开展除四害爱国卫生运动，就是为生产服务，搞好除四害，就是保证生产发展的一个重要条件。
    几年来，由于爱国卫生运动的开展，大量消灭了四害，人们逐步创造了控制传染病的条件，使发病率不断地下降，出勤率不断地提高，对生产所起的积极的促进作用，几乎在每个农业社都可以明显地看出来。农村里，到处流传着“清洁积肥多打粮，消灭疾病保安康”、“消灭四害少疾病，生产发展有保证”等生动的口号。
    有人说，我们并不反对除四害，只是把它丢了几个月，等秋后再除，这有什么！这些人不知道，除四害是在和自然开战，对待四害应该有敌情观点，有警惕性。目前，四害特别是蚊蝇，每天每时都在大量地繁殖，多一只蚊蝇，就会多向人们传播一些病菌。只要有四害存在，就有被它们传染上疾病的危险。除恶务尽！我们对四害不能存有侥幸心理。现在它们虽大量繁殖，但是容易暴露，生命脆弱，现在消灭它们比起冬春季更为方便，应该抓住时机。
    在夏秋季除四害，由于受到时间和人力的限制，困难要比冬春季多得多，这是事实。但是忙虽忙，也不是像带着罢战情绪的人所说的那样，忙得一点空隙也没有。夏秋季农事的最大特点，是季节性强，一项农活接着一项农活，或者两项农活交叉进行，劳动力动员的面广而且非常集中。到最繁忙的收割或者下种的时候，在劳动力缺乏的地区，连有些老奶奶和儿童也要参加田间劳动。但是尽管如此，也不是天天都是同样的忙。根据许多地区的情况，不管农时来的早或者迟，在夏秋季，每季都分几段，而在每段中间以及段与段之间，都有三五天、七八天，或者更长一些的空隙。农业生产本身就是有节奏的。因之，按照农业生产的节奏，抓住农事的间隙，安排一些短期的除四害突击性活动，仍然是有条件和有保证的。
    除去一些突击性的活动以外，结合夏秋农业生产的许多项目，结合农业社的生产组织，还可以安排许多经常性的除四害活动。例如积肥和灌溉可以结合消灭蚊蝇的孳生条件；铲草皮积肥可以结合灭钉螺；肥桑可以与灭鼠结合；灭蝗灭螟可以结合灭蚊蝇、孑孓和灭钉螺；清洁员、饲养员可以包干处理人畜粪便等等。又如每天早晚打扫室内外卫生，只要勤于动手，养成了爱清洁的习惯，在下田前或是回家后，利用几分钟的空隙，就可以解决问题。
    总之，各地的具体情况虽不同，只要注意研究当地农业季节的特点，掌握住它的规律，并紧紧贯彻除四害为生产服务，服从生产并结合生产的精神，具体组织除四害的突击性的与经常性的各种活动，把群众发动起来，就可以做到既保证了除四害运动的深入开展，又保证不影响当前生产任务的完成。
