Sister Carries Soil, Brother Digs Pond
	Sister carries soil, brother digs pond,
	Sweat drips with the muddy water,
	Sister carries a thousand loads, unaware of fatigue,
	Brother stays in the mud, feeling no cold.
	Too many people around to speak my mind,
	Paper lantern shines bright in my heart,
	Sister is a hero, brother a fine man,
	Digging until the stars fall and the sun rises.
		(Anhui, Shidai)

A Whirlwind of Coming and Going
	A fine Mount Xuefeng,
	The mountain is thirteen hundred high,
	To see my lover,
	Is harder than climbing to heaven.
	Now the road is open,
	Smooth and level,
	A whirlwind of coming and going,
	Brother and sister are connected. (Hunan)

Unable to Sit Still in the Bridal Chamber
	New bride, beautiful bride,
	Unable to sit still in the bridal chamber,
	Calling the groom to lead the way,
	To dig a pit and enjoy happiness.
	New bride, beautiful bride,
	Unable to sit still in the bridal chamber,
	Calling the groom to carry together,
	Tonight we dig the pond and see who loses.
		(Henan, Fugou)

Going and Coming Among the Stars and Moon
	Brother goes to spring plowing, sister accumulates fertilizer,
	Sweet in the heart, joy on the brow,
	The spring breeze is like a chasing bird,
	Accumulated fertilizer is like a small mountain,
	Going and coming among the stars and moon. (Chen Zhi)

Even and Dense Planting of Rice Seedlings
	Sister goes to the field to learn to plant rice seedlings,
	Brother follows close by,
	First, to provide technical guidance,
	Second, to help with mountain songs,
	Even and dense planting of rice seedlings.
		(Hunan, Yuanjiang, Guo Xiqian)

    妹妹英雄哥好汉
    ——新情歌选
    妹妹挑土哥挖塘
    妹妹挑土哥挖塘，
    汗珠跟着泥水淌，
    妹挑千担不知累，
    哥在泥里不觉凉。
    人多不好把话讲，
    纸糊灯笼心里亮，
    妹妹英雄哥好汉，
    挖到星落露太阳。
              （安徽石埭）
    来往一涡风
    好座雪峰山，
    山高一千三，
    要想见情哥，
    硬比上天难。
    如今通马路，
    光滑又平坦，
    来往一涡风，
    哥妹两相连。（湖南）
    洞房里边坐不住
    新媳妇、花媳妇，
    洞房里边坐不住，
    叫声新郎快领路，
    去挖坑塘享幸福。
    新媳妇、花媳妇，
    洞房里边坐不住，
    叫声新郎咱俩抬，
    今夜挖塘看谁输。
              （河南扶沟）
    星里去来月里回
    哥去春耕妹积肥，
    甜在心头喜在眉，
    春风好似追风鸟，
    积肥犹如小山堆，
    星里去来月里回。（陈志）
    均匀密植插好秧
    情妹下田学插秧，
    情哥跟随在身旁，
    一来技术作指导，
    二来山歌好帮腔，
    均匀密植插好秧。
        （湖南沅江郭喜前）
