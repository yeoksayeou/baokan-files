　　Films that Coordinate More Production and More Release to Support the Technological Revolution
    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party issued a call to the people of the whole country to march toward the technological revolution. Throughout the country, technological reforms and technological revolutions have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Learning from each other's experiences and technologies has become the requirement of the broad masses of cadres and people. However, due to limitations of time and distance, mutual visits and learning are limited. Therefore, it is hoped that our film industry can shoulder this task and meet this requirement.
    For example, the Pingyuan Power Station in Tianjin Prefecture, the pilot small fertilizer plant of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the pilot small oil refinery of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, many small blast furnaces, small cement plants, the artificial fiber plant in Sichuan Province, and even the recently successfully trial-produced internal combustion water pump, and various improved farm tools, etc. These are things that millions of people want to see in detail and learn from. If our filmmakers can film it (construction process, production process) and add some popular charts and explanations, it can help many people learn from experience, promote the development of construction, and make our film industry cooperate with the technological revolution movement.

    Recently, we watched several very good news documentaries, such as "Bicycle-type Water Wheel," "Crowbar-type Water Wheel," "Horse-drawn Generator," and "Raising Pigs in Caves." They reflected the infinite wisdom of the people of the motherland in the Great Leap Forward in a timely and vivid way, making many valuable creations and reforms, which made people learn a lot after watching them. It is hoped that such films can be shown more often in the future.

　　多拍多放配合技术革命的电影
    党的“八大”二次会议向全国人民发出了向技术革命大进军的号召，在全国各地，技术改革与技术革命已雨后春笋般地发展起来，互相学习经验，学习技术已成为广大干部与群众的要求。但由于时间与距离的限制，互相参观学习毕竟是有限度的，因此希望我们的电影事业能够负担这一任务与要求。
    例如天津专区的平原发电站，化工部试点的小化肥厂，石油部试点的小炼油厂，不少的小高炉，小水泥厂，四川省的人造纤维厂以至最近试制成功的内燃水泵，各式改良农具等等。这是有千百万人要求详细看看并要学习的。我们的电影工作者如果能将它摄成电影（建设过程，生产过程）并能加上一些通俗的图表与说明，就可以帮助很多人学习经验，就可以推动建设事业的发展，使我们的电影事业配合了技术革命运动。

    最近我们看了几部非常好的新闻纪录片，如“脚踏车式水车”、“撬板式水车”、“马拉发电机”、“山洞养猪”等。它们及时而又生动地反映了祖国人民在大跃进中，发挥了无穷的智慧，作出了许多有价值的创造和改革，使人看了学到不少东西。希望今后能多多放映这样的影片。
