    Inner Mongolia Carries Out Large-Scale Sheep Improvement
    Third Generation Improved Sheep in Nanshan Pastoral Area Approaching Purebred Xinjiang Fine-Wool Sheep
    (Our Newspaper News) The largest sheep improvement campaign in China's history has recently begun in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than 10,000 various high-quality fine-wool and semi-fine-wool rams are being transferred and introduced to various agricultural and pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia from both domestic and foreign sources. A team of more than 6,000 artificial insemination technicians and more than 3,000 sheep breeding stations are also being intensively trained and actively established throughout the autonomous region. This year, Inner Mongolia will improve 2.23 million local sheep, and the reproduction rate of improved lambs is expected to reach 80%. This task accounts for more than one-third of the total number of sheep to be improved nationwide this year. (Qin Jilun)
    (Our Newspaper News) Kazakh herdsmen in the Nanshan pastoral area of Manas County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have made achievements in improving sheep. Currently, this pastoral area has a total of 85 purebred Xinjiang sheep rams introduced from the Gongnais Breeding Farm, 1,992 third-generation improved sheep crossed locally, 3,934 second-generation improved sheep, 8,036 first-generation improved sheep, and more than 15,000 lambs of various generations. By next year, this pastoral area will be able to breed fourth-generation purebred, wool-and-meat Xinjiang fine-wool sheep for promotion to other areas. The third-generation improved lambs born this year, judging from their appearance, have white and dense wool, approaching the quality of purebred Xinjiang fine-wool sheep. The herdsmen take meticulous care of the improved lambs, saying that these sheep are less prone to disease, more cold-resistant, larger in size, heavier in weight, and produce more twins (20%). The price of wool from one such sheep is equivalent to the price of wool from six or seven local Kazakh sheep, and the wool income from one hundred fine-wool sheep is enough to cover the annual living expenses of a family of five.

    内蒙古大规模改良绵羊
    南山牧区第三代改良羊接近纯种新疆细毛羊
    本报讯　我国历史上最大的绵羊改良运动，最近在内蒙古自治区开始了。现在一万多只各种优良的细毛和半细毛种公羊，正陆续从国内外向内蒙古各农牧区调拨引入。六千多名的人工授精技术队伍和三千多个绵羊配种站，也正在自治区各地加紧训练和积极筹建。今年内蒙古要改良本地绵羊二百二十三万只，经过改良的幼羔繁殖率要达到80％。这项任务占全国今年改良绵羊总数的三分之一以上。（秦继仑）
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区玛纳斯县南山牧区哈萨克族牧民，改良绵羊工作有成绩。现在，这个牧区共拥有从巩乃斯种羊场引进的纯种新疆羊种公羊八十五只，当地杂交到第三代改良羊一千九百九十二只，第二代改良羊三千九百三十四只，第一代改良羊八千零三十六只，以及各代羊羔一万五千多只。到了明年，这个牧区就可以培育出第四代纯种毛肉兼用的新疆细毛羊，向外地推广。今年生下的第三代改良羊羔，从外形上看，毛色洁白细密，接近纯种新疆细毛羊的质量。牧民对于改良羊羔爱护备至，他们说这种羊生病少、抗寒力强，体格大、分量重、双羔多（20％），一只羊毛的价钱顶上六、七个土种哈萨克羊毛的价钱，一百只细毛羊的羊毛收入，已足以解决一个五口之家的全年生活费用。　（杨克现）
