    Like a Great Red Flag
    A worker at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Jiang Yude.
    A new apprentice came to the construction site, sleeves rolled high, face covered in cement like a mud figure, leading the work without a peep.
    Hey, this new apprentice, always smiling when he sees people, skilled in technique, quick in action, he is number one in model evaluations.
    This new apprentice, seems like I've seen him somewhere, I carefully take a look at him, ah, it turns out he is our General Manager.
    Hey, this new apprentice, sleeves rolled high, standing on the very top of the blast furnace, like a great red flag.

    好像一杆大红旗
    武钢工人  蒋育德工地来了个新徒弟，袖口卷得高高的，满脸洋灰像泥人，带头干活不啃气。哟，这个新徒弟，见人总是笑嘻嘻，技术熟练动作快，评模定属他第一。这个新徒弟，好像哪儿见过的，仔细将他瞧一瞧，呵，原来是我们总经理。哟，这个新徒弟，袖口卷得高高的，站在高炉最顶上，好像一杆大红旗。
