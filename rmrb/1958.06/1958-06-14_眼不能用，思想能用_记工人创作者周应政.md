    Eyes Cannot See, but the Mind Can Be Used
    —Remembering the Worker-Creator Zhou Yingzheng
    On stage appeared a worker in grey clothing. He sang a ditty of his own creation, "Electrified Drying of Archives." With humorous and witty expressions and singing, he vividly portrayed a lazy man irresponsible in managing archives, as if this person were standing right before the audience. The person who performed this program at the recent Chongqing City Workers' Art Performance was Zhou Yingzheng, a worker from the Chongqing Changjiang Electric Factory. It was only when the two curtains were about to close that the audience saw him being led offstage by another person, realizing that he was, in fact, blind.
    Zhou Yingzheng, in his forties, can be described as an active propagandist and mobilizer at the Changjiang Electric Factory. For over six years, he has written more than 340 folk art lyrics, three acts of Sichuan opera reflecting the lives of modern laborers, and a one-act clapper talk drama, all based on real people and events in the factory.
    For Zhou Yingzheng, creation and performance are more difficult than for others. Zhou Yingzheng only studied in a private school for three or four years in the past, and now he is also blind. But Zhou Yingzheng thought: "I can't see, but I can hear. If my eyes are useless, my mind can still be used."
    He often said to others, "I'm not good at production, but I can still contribute in other ways." Therefore, from 1950 onwards, he would ask his children to take him to cultural school for evening classes. Later, he went to a workers' amateur folk art creation class organized by the Chongqing Municipal Laboring People's Cultural Palace for four years. He relied on "listening" for meticulous learning. He learned while practicing writing. How to write without seeing? At first, after he had a mature idea, he would recite it and ask others to help him write it down. But other people's work tasks were also tight, so they had to put it aside. How could this work? He went to the cultural school to discuss it with the political instructor. The political instructor helped him come up with the idea of writing with cardboard grids. After trying it out, this method didn't work. Finally, he came up with the idea of using stacks of thick, narrow paper strips cut from books in the printing room to write. The night the method was devised, he was extremely excited and immediately sat down to write a lyrics piece, writing from evening until dawn the next day. Who knew that the pen ran out of ink, and after writing all night, he only managed to write seven characters clearly. He was a little frustrated. But he thought again: "The working class can make high mountains bow their heads, can make rivers give way, and will definitely master culture."
    The next evening, he started writing again, using a pencil instead of a pen. For several years, he has been writing by touching these thick paper strips.
    When he was studying and writing, the factory's Party committee cared for Zhou Yingzheng very much. Seeing that he had difficulties, they always encouraged him and sent comrades to help him find materials and clues. Zhou Yingzheng wanted to reflect the style of modern workers profoundly and quickly, but there were still many difficulties. For example, he could not personally see the vigorous energy and daring and heroic spirit of his colleagues working in the workshop. Therefore, he often stayed in the workshop to listen, listening to the sound of the newly improved machines, listening to the conversations of his colleagues… He didn't just listen; he also often visited his colleagues' homes. Now, wherever Zhou Yingzheng goes in the factory, someone helps him to sit down, and another helps him find someone to talk to. The workers always tell him about any new innovations and plans in detail, without leaving anything out.

    眼不能用，思想能用
    ——记工人创作者周应政
    舞台上出现了一个灰色衣帽的工人。他演唱了自己创作的一首金钱板“电气化烘档案”。他用幽默、诙谐的表情和唱腔，把一个管理档案不负责的懒汉刻画得活龙活现，好像这个人就站在观众的眼前。在最近举行的重庆市工人的文艺观摩表演会上演出这个节目的人，就是重庆长江电工厂工人周应政。只是在两块幕布快合拢的时候，观众看见他被另一个人牵引着下场，才发现他原来是个双目失明的人。
    四十多岁的周应政在长江电工厂称得上是个活跃的宣传鼓动家。六年多来，他以厂里的真人真事，写作了三百四十多首曲艺唱词和三幕反映现代劳动人民生活的川剧、一幕快板剧。
    创作和演唱，对周应政来说，比别人更困难一些。周应政过去只念过三、四年私塾，如今眼睛又瞎了。但是周应政想：“我看不见，能听得见，眼睛不中用了，思想还能用。”
    他常对别人说：“我生产上不行啦，在别的方面还可以出一分力。”于是，从1950年起一到晚上就叫孩子把自己送到文化学校去听课。后来，他又到重庆市劳动人民文化宫办的工人业余曲艺创作学习班去学习了四年。他就是靠着“听”而精心学习。他一边学习，一边练习写作。看不见，怎么写字呢？起初，他构思成熟以后，念出来，请别人帮他写。但别人的工作任务也很紧，只得搁下来。这怎么行呢？他跑到文化学校去和政治教员商量。政治教员帮助他想出了用纸板格子写字的办法，一试验，这办法行不通。最后才想出用铅印房从书本上切掉的一叠叠厚的窄纸条写。办法想成的当晚，他兴奋极了，马上坐下来写了一篇唱词，从晚上一直写到第二天天亮。哪知道钢笔没有墨水了，写了一整夜只写清楚了七个字。他有点懊丧了。但是他又想：“工人阶级能叫高山低头，能叫河水让路，一定能掌握文化。”
    第二天晚上，他又开始写了，用铅笔代替了钢笔。几年来，他就是这样摸着厚纸条写作。
    在他学习和写作时，厂党委十分关怀周应政，看到他有困难，总是鼓励他，又派同志帮他找材料、找线索。周应政要尽快地把现代工人的风格深刻地反映出来，还有不少困难。比如：他不能亲眼见到伙伴们在车间里劳动的那股生龙活虎般的干劲，那种敢想敢作的英雄气概。于是，他就常常守在车间去听，听刚经过改进的机器的响声，听伙伴们的对话……。他听了还不够，还常常到伙伴们的家里去访问。现在，周应政无论走到哪个车间，总是这个扶着他坐，那个帮助他找人谈话。工人弟兄们有什么新的革新和打算，总要一件不漏地详细告诉他。    本报记者  黎素芬
