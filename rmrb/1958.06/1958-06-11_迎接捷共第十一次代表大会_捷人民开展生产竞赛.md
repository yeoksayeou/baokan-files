Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 10th: In order to welcome the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which will open on June 18th, the working people of Czechoslovakia are going all out to vigorously carry out the socialist emulation movement.

The main purpose of the competition movement is to overcome shortcomings and achieve the most important tasks in various industrial sectors. An important feature of this movement is the widespread application of new technologies and the unprecedented development of the technical innovation movement.

The achievements made by coal mines and the machine industry in the competition are particularly valuable. From the beginning of this year to May 24, Czechoslovak miners overfulfilled their coal production plan by 1.5 million tons. Miners enthusiastically participated in the competition movement, enabling them to complete 104.3% of the production plan for the first four months of this year.

Workers at the Trinec Iron and Steel Plant, one of the important metallurgical factories in Ostrava State, produced approximately 5,500 tons of steel, 2,200 tons of pig iron, and 3,000 tons of steel materials above the plan from the second quarter to mid-May.

The Dawn Factory in Gottwaldov, the largest shoe factory in Czechoslovakia, decided to produce 75,000 pairs of leather and rubber shoes above the plan in the second quarter.
