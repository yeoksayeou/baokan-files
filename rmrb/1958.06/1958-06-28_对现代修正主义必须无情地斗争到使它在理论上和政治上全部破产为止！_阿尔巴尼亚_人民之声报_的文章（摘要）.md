Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 27th: The Albanian "People's Voice" published an article on the 22nd criticizing the Yugoslav Communist Party Program, titled "An Unrelenting Struggle Against Modern Revisionism Until Its Complete Theoretical and Political Bankruptcy!"

The article stated that all Marxist-Leninist parties are currently engaged in a resolute struggle against the Yugoslav revisionists. The Yugoslav revisionists have launched a new, shameless attack on Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, and communist and workers' parties worldwide. The Yugoslav Communist leaders groundlessly treat the correct and factually based criticisms made by Marxist-Leninist parties, and desperately try to escape this criticism with tactics of blackmail and rumors, accusing our countries' parties of reverting to 1948, distorting the views of the Yugoslav Communist leaders and incorrectly attacking "innocent victims," interfering in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, and infringing upon its sovereignty, etc. Like a rogue swindler, Tito's Judas-like rhetoric in his speech on June 15th once again demonstrates that he has always been a revisionist, a traitor to Marxist-Leninists.

The article continued, but such a flawed blackmail cannot cover up historical facts. Historical facts prove that the Yugoslav Communist leaders betrayed Marxism-Leninism long ago and became agents of the imperialist bourgeoisie. Our party has never had illusions about the Yugoslav Communist leaders because our party has seen through their true colors, because their anti-Marxist activities have left bloodstains on our party and people. From the Yugoslav revisionists' vow to continue their path, it is once again very clear that they are incorrigible, and only one conclusion can be drawn: that the mask worn by modern revisionism should be torn off, and that there should be an unrelenting struggle against it to the end.

The article then, after exposing the Yugoslav Communist leaders' slanders against the Soviet Union, stated: These slanders also have the purpose of concealing the Tito clique's hostile activities. For many years, the Tito clique has been fabricating these slanders to accuse the Soviet Union, openly interfering in the internal affairs of communist and socialist countries, and attempting to sabotage from within. Albania is the best evidence of this. Because the League of Communists of Yugoslavia leadership has not interfered so openly and brutally in any other country as it has in Albania. From before liberation to today, they have held a completely anti-Marxist and chauvinistic attitude toward our party and country. They have systematically and used every means to try to turn our Marxist-Leninist party into an opportunist party, to turn socialist Albania into a part of the Yugoslav state, and to infringe upon the freedom and independence that our people have won with their blood.

On the eve of Albania's liberation, November 1944, before the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Communist Party was held in the liberated city of Berat, the Yugoslav leadership sent a delegation headed by Velimir Stojnić to Albania. According to Tito's instructions, they secretly organized an extremely dangerous sectarian group in our party's leadership. The Yugoslav leaders racked their brains to try to disintegrate and subvert our party's faithful leadership, wanting to replace it with opportunists and traitors such as Koçi Xoxe and Shefqet Peçi, etc. The Yugoslav leaders attacked our party's political line, saying it was wrong, when in fact this line had already proven correct in the flames of the national liberation war. This line achieved a historic victory for our people—liberating them from the fascist occupiers and domestic reactionary rule. The Yugoslav leaders attempted to export to our party the "Yugoslav line" of denying the Soviet Union's role and wanting us to break away from the Soviet Union. But the Titoists' subversive activities were not completely successful. Because Hoxha and other strong party leaders, despite not understanding the secret backstage of Berat, were fighting to defend the party's correct line. However, the Titoists partially achieved their goals. The Titoists' subversive activities were the "assistance" that the Yugoslav Communist leaders gave to our young party, and that was how they repaid the blood shed by our two divisions of soldiers who fought alongside the Yugoslav brothers for the liberation of Yugoslavia. Isn't the Titoists' subversive activity in Berat and the barbaric and crazy interference in the internal affairs of an independent country enough to prove the degeneration process of the Yugoslav revisionists? Doesn't it clearly illustrate the hypocrisy of the Yugoslav revisionists' arguments about respecting equality, sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and the purpose of concealing their dangerous sabotage activities?

The article continued, the Yugoslav leaders pursued anti-Marxist, colonialist, and exploitative goals in their economic relations with our country. Some economic agreements and plans, protocols, etc., signed with Yugoslavia in 1946 violated the basic principles of relations between independent countries. The Yugoslav leaders used these to turn our country into a colony, seriously damaging our economy. The Yugoslav leaders used these treaties and plans to develop our economy as part of the Yugoslav economy, subject to its constraints, supplying Yugoslavia with raw materials, abandoning the development of our industry, destroying food production, and making our food problem also dependent on Yugoslavia. At the insistence of the Yugoslav government, a planning coordination committee headed by Yugoslavs was established in Tirana, which was actually a government above the Albanian People's Government. A document signed by Kidrič, the former chairman of the Yugoslav Planning Commission, stated: Albania is like the seventh republic of Yugoslavia. Can a truly Marxist-Leninist party, a truly socialist country, pursue such colonialist and exploitative policies as the League of Communists of Yugoslavia treated our country? Only social chauvinists and those who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and socialism can pursue such policies. The policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia leadership are very similar to the policies of the French right-wing social democrats and the British Labour Party towards the colonies. Nevertheless, the Yugoslav revisionists still want to teach the people's democratic countries how to establish relations with the Soviet Union like Yugoslavia. Vidić, the Yugoslav Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, even said to the leaders of the people's democratic countries that you have not tasted the sweetness of independence.

Although our Party Central Committee did not understand the true intentions of the Yugoslav leaders at the beginning, it still put forward many correct opinions on economic relations between the two countries. However, the Yugoslav revisionists opposed these with the help of cliques, and adopted all kinds of Trotskyist methods to achieve their goals, dividing the unity of the leaders. Many envoys, diplomats, advisors, technicians, and experts sent by the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party as representatives to Albania actively carried out activities to implement the instructions of the Yugoslav Communist leaders, trying to collect agents and help splitters try to place the key departments of our party and country under the control of the Yugoslav leaders. In the second half of 1947, the Yugoslav leaders presented two indictments and two ultimatums to our Party Central Committee. In the indictment in November 1947, the Yugoslav revisionists accused our party because our party strengthened relations with the Soviet Union, saying that Comrade Enver Hoxha "changed his policy after returning from Moscow and opposed Yugoslavia," saying that our party seemed to be condoning the establishment of an anti-Yugoslav front in Albania, saying that our government seemed to be hindering the assistance that Yugoslavia would give to the Albanian people, saying that our first five-year plan was unrealistic and absolutely subjective, because this plan separated our economy from the Yugoslav economy, etc. This greatly helped the sectarian group established in Berat. In this case, the Koçi Xoxe sectarian group used Trotskyist methods to collude behind the scenes with representatives of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, preparing for the Eighth Plenary Session held in February 1948. This was the heaviest blow to our party and Albania's independence after the Second Plenary Session in Berat. At the meeting, the general secretary was attacked and many comrades who defended the party with him were persecuted, opening the door to Yugoslavia's open interference. The materials held by the Central Committee proved that Koçi Xoxe, in order to completely achieve his goals, accelerated the fabrication and fabrication of groundless trials, preparing to eliminate our leaders personally. But he did not achieve this goal. The Yugoslavs and their friends began to openly talk about the "merger" of Albania with Yugoslavia, calling Albania the "Seventh Republic of Yugoslavia." The Koçi Xoxe sectarian group submitted this issue to the Politburo, but it was not successful. In 1948, when the Tito clique was about to be exposed, the Yugoslav revisionists, in order to make the merger of Albania into Yugoslavia a fait accompli, urgently requested the dispatch of several Yugoslav divisions to Albania, nominally to defend our country and resist the imminent invasion of the Greek army. But our party, regardless of the pressure from the Yugoslav leaders and the Koçi Xoxe sectarian group, did not accept this approach. This historic decision saved our people from bloodshed. Obviously, if our party, led by the strong part of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha, had not resisted, if it had not been for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, if the Cominform had not made a decision in time, the independence of our party and country would have been lost. Albania would have become a territory of Yugoslavia. It was these that saved us. Therefore, our party and people call the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Union the two liberators, and have lifelong gratitude for them. From these facts, it can be clearly seen how shameless Tito's recent statement is. He called the Yugoslav revisionists "victims" who were persecuted for maintaining principled arguments about the correct relations between socialist countries, and described them as heroes who "saved socialism from corruption and chaos."

The article said that from these facts, it can be seen how absurd the Yugoslav Communist leaders' claim is to us Albanian Communists. They insisted that the attitude towards them in 1948 was very incorrect. The criticism of the Yugoslav Communist leaders by the communist and workers' parties of various countries in 1948 was completely correct and in accordance with the facts. Because the Yugoslav Communist leaders had long left Marxism-Leninism and stood on the position of bourgeois nationalism and social chauvinism. History has proven this point.

Although the Yugoslav Communist leaders superficially agreed and began to establish relations with our country and various countries' parties in 1955, they still tried every means to use the situation at that time to realize their plans. The Yugoslav revisionists used the correct criticism of the cult of personality of Stalin as a weapon to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union and our various countries' parties. But this was in vain. Because, as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said, Stalin was a great revolutionary and Marxist, and made great contributions to defending and developing Marxist-Leninist theory, to the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, to the glorious victory of the Soviet people against Hitler's aggressors, and to the development of the international communist movement. The Yugoslav revisionists began a real crusade under the banner of "de-Stalinization," attacking Marxism-Leninism, destroying our various countries' parties and socialist countries, and splitting the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Tito himself had called for the overthrow of the leaders of our various countries' parties and countries. When the bloody events in Hungary occurred, the Yugoslav Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said to the relevant ambassador: "Wait, such things will also happen in Albania and Bulgaria." Tito, Kadar, and the Yugoslav press repeatedly repeated this provocation. Are these not the most shameless interference in our internal affairs and the shameless conspiracy to destroy our party? Even after the Belgrade Declaration, when the Tito clique expressed that it seemed willing to improve relations with socialist countries, they still continued to exert all pressure on Albania, asking our party to wash away the serious anti-Marxist and chauvinistic mistakes committed by the Yugoslav leaders, and demanding the rehabilitation of the criminal and traitor Koçi Xoxe. The leaders of the Yugoslav newspapers launched a crazy hostile movement against our party. They described the situation in Albania as like hell, saying that terror and poverty shrouded Albania. They called for an uprising to overthrow what they called the "Stalinist" party and the people's democratic system, and published many vulgar slanderous cartoons slandering our party and state leaders. The publications and radio stations of all imperialist countries' Albanian reactionary exiles, along with the Yugoslav publications, shouted for our people to rise up and overthrow the "anti-democratic Stalinist socialism" and replace it with "Tito's humanitarian socialism." This is not accidental. They tried their best to collect opportunists, people expelled from our party, and enemies of the party to undermine the unity of the party and arouse the people's dissatisfaction with the party. In order to subvert the party and the people's regime, conspiracy activities were organized through anti-party elements. The Rini Gega and Dali Ndreu group, the Tu Jakova and Petri Spahiu group, etc., who organized hostile activities at the Tirana Party Congress, clearly illustrate this point. The communists and people of our country have every right to ask: Why are there more than 3,000 Albanian fugitives hiding in Yugoslavia, many of whom are fascist criminals? Why are the Yugoslav revisionists trying their best to recruit intelligence officers to collect military intelligence about our country?

The Yugoslav revisionists not only opposed Albania, but also divided and subverted the fraternal parties, hindering their struggle for socialism and peace. The Hungarian counter-revolutionary events more clearly showed that the Yugoslav revisionists had become the best tool of American imperialists to undermine our party and socialist countries from within. The Yugoslav revisionists actively participated in the preparation of the counter-revolutionary events, carrying out large-scale activities to destroy the Hungarian Working People's Party and the country, in order to instigate hostile elements to oppose them. Now the Tito clique can no longer hide from anyone its responsibility for the sons of the Hungarian and Soviet people who sacrificed themselves for the Hungarian events.

The article said that Yugoslav revisionism is not an accidental phenomenon, it arises under certain historical conditions, and it has its objective basis. American imperialists and other imperialists, at the expense of their money, gave the Tito clique a large amount of "aid" of more than three billion US dollars. Yugoslav revisionism developed and gained a foothold on this economic basis, and it objectively played the role of an agent of monopoly bourgeoisie in the socialist camp and the international communist movement. In order to conceal this role, the Yugoslav revisionists disguised themselves with Marxist-Leninist rhetoric, saying that they were building socialism, but socialism can never be built on the anti-Marxist road, under the leadership of revisionists, and with the help of American imperialism. The Yugoslav revisionists have degenerated into a traitorous group serving the imperialist policy. The characteristic of the Yugoslav revisionists is that they seized power by deceiving the Yugoslav people, and now they not only use propaganda but also use all the means and possibilities created by the state power to achieve their goals. The long-term hostile activities of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia against our party and country, the tragedy of Hungary, and all activities against other fraternal parties clearly illustrate the dangerous role of Yugoslav revisionism. The role currently played by Yugoslav revisionism in serving imperialism can only be unseen by those who deliberately close their eyes, and we Marxist-Leninist parties cannot underestimate this danger. We Marxist-Leninist parties are resolutely exposing modern revisionism and will continue to fight uncompromisingly until it is completely destroyed in theory and politics.

Our party has always maintained a correct Marxist-Leninist attitude towards the Yugoslav Communist leaders, and has unwaveringly fought against the anti-Marxist and anti-socialist views and activities of the Yugoslav revisionists. Our party has always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism, always defends the independence and freedom of our people as the most precious thing, and is always closely linked to the Soviet Union and socialist countries. Our party will continue to resolutely fight against modern revisionism.

Modern revisionists will inevitably fail, because the strength of Marxism-Leninism and the strength of the communist parties of various countries are indestructible.

    对现代修正主义必须无情地斗争到使它在理论上和政治上全部破产为止！
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”的文章（摘要）
    新华社地拉那27日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”22日发表了一篇批判南共纲领的文章，题目是“对现代修正主义必须无情地斗争到使它在理论上和政治上全部破产为止！”
    文章说，所有马克思列宁主义政党都正在对南斯拉夫的修正主义者进行坚决的斗争。南斯拉夫修正主义者对马克思列宁主义、苏联、社会主义阵营以及全世界的共产党和工人党展开了新的无耻的进攻。南共领导人毫无理由地对待马克思列宁主义政党所作出的正确的、有事实根据的批判，并且竭力用讹诈、造谣的伎俩逃脱这种批判，责难我们各国党，说它们正在转回到1948年，说他们歪曲南共领导者的观点和不正确地打击“无辜的牺牲者”，说他们在干涉南斯拉夫的内政和侵犯它的主权等等。像无赖的骗子一样，铁托在6月15日的演说中所用的犹大似的言辞，再一次表明他始终是修正主义者，是马克思列宁主义者的叛徒。
    文章接着说，但是这样漏洞百出的讹诈是不能够掩盖历史事实的。历史事实证明，南共领导人很久以来就背叛了马克思列宁主义，变成了帝国主义的资产阶级的代理人。我们党从来没有对南共领导人存有幻想，因为我们党看透了他们的真面目，因为他们的反马克思主义的活动在我们党和人民的身上留下了血迹。从南斯拉夫修正主义者们要继续他们的道路的誓言里再一次地十分明显地看出，他们是无可救药的，只能得出一个结论：即应该撕破现代修正主义所戴的假面具，应该无情地同它斗争到底。
    文章接着在揭露南共领导人对苏联的诬蔑之后说：这些诬蔑还有着掩盖铁托集团的敌对活动的目的。很多年以来，铁托集团就在制造这些谰言来责难苏联，就在公开地干涉共产党和社会主义国家的内政，妄图从内部来进行破坏。阿尔巴尼亚是证实这点的最好证据。因为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人没有对任何其他一个国家像对阿尔巴尼亚进行过这样公开的、粗暴的干涉。从解放前到今天，他们对我们党和国家一直抱着彻头彻尾的反马克思主义的和沙文主义的态度。他们系统地、并且用尽了一切手段想把我们的马克思列宁主义政党变成一个机会主义政党，把社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚变成南斯拉夫国家的一个部分，侵犯我国人民用鲜血取得的自由独立。
    阿尔巴尼亚解放的前夜1944年11月，阿尔巴尼亚共产党在解放了的城市——贝拉特召开中央委员会第二次全会之前，南斯拉夫领导派遣了一个以维里米尔·斯多尼奇为首的代表团前来阿尔巴尼亚。他们根据铁托的指令在我们党的首脑部门秘密地组织了一个极危险的宗派集团。南斯拉夫领导人挖空心思地企图瓦解、颠覆我们党的忠实领导，想以机会主义者和叛徒科奇·佐泽、谢弗拉·马列绍瓦等人取而代之。南斯拉夫领导人攻击我们党的政治路线，说它是错误的，其实这一路线在民族解放战争的烈火里已经证实了它是正确的。这一路线取得了我国人民历史性的胜利——使他们从法西斯占领者和国内反动统治下解放出来。南斯拉夫领导人企图向我们党输出否认苏联作用的和要我们脱离苏联的“南斯拉夫路线”。但是铁托分子的颠覆活动是不能完全得逞的。因为霍查和其他坚强的党的领导人尽管不了解贝拉特的秘密后幕，但他们为了保卫党的正确路线而进行着斗争。可是铁托分子部分地达到了目的。铁托分子的颠覆活动就是南共领导人给予我们年轻的党的“援助”，就是这样报答我们两个师的战士同南斯拉夫兄弟并肩作战、为南斯拉夫的解放而流的鲜血。难道铁托分子在贝拉特的颠覆活动和野蛮疯狂地干涉一个独立国家的内政，还不足够证明南斯拉夫修正主义者蜕化的过程吗？难道还不清楚地说明了南斯拉夫修正主义者尊重平等、主权、不干涉内政和目的在于掩饰其危险的破坏活动的虚伪论调么？
    文章接着说，南斯拉夫领导人在与我国的经济关系中追随着反马克思主义、殖民主义和剥削的目的。1946年与南斯拉夫签订的一些经济协定和计划、议定书等侵犯了独立国家之间关系的基本原则，南斯拉夫领导者以此来使我国变成为殖民地，严重地损害了我国经济。南斯拉夫领导人利用这些条约和计划的配合，把我国的经济作为南斯拉夫经济的一个部分来发展，受其约制，供给南斯拉夫原料，放弃我国工业的发展，破坏粮食生产，使我们的粮食问题也取决于南斯拉夫。在南斯拉夫政府的坚持下，在地拉那曾经成立了以南斯拉夫人为首的计划配合委员会，实际上是站在阿尔巴尼亚人民政府头上的政府。在南斯拉夫过去的计划委员会主席吉德利奇签字的一项文件中写道：阿尔巴尼亚好像是南斯拉夫的第七加盟共和国。一个真正的马克思列宁主义的党，一个真正的社会主义国家，难道能像南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟对待我国那样奉行着这样的殖民主义和剥削的政策吗？只有社会沙文主义和叛变了马克思列宁主义和社会主义的人，才能奉行这样的政策。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导的政策很像法国右派社会民主党和英国工党对待殖民地的政策。尽管如此，南斯拉夫修正主义者还想教训人民民主国家，应如南斯拉夫一样建立与苏联的关系。南斯拉夫外交国务副秘书长维迪奇甚至对人民民主国家领导人说，你们没有尝试过独立的甜蜜味道。
    我党中央委员会尽管在开始时还不明了南斯拉夫领导人的真正企图，依然就两国经济关系提出了很多正确的意见。但是南斯拉夫修正主义者在小集团的帮助下反对这些，并为达到他们的目的采用了一切托洛茨基的方法，分裂领导人的团结。南共中央作为代表派来阿尔巴尼亚的很多使节、外交官以及顾问、技术人员和专家，都为执行南共领导人的指示而积极展开活动，力图搜罗代理人，帮助分裂主义者设法将我党和国家的要害部门置于南斯拉夫领导人之手。1947年下半年，南斯拉夫领导人向我们党中央委员会提出两个控诉书和两个最后通牒。南斯拉夫修正主义者在1947年11月的控诉书中控诉我们党，是因为我们党加强同苏联的关系，它说恩维尔·霍查同志“从莫斯科回来后就变了政策，反对南斯拉夫”，说我们党似乎在纵容在阿尔巴尼亚建立一个反南阵线，说我国政府似乎在阻碍南斯拉夫将给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的援助，说我国第一个五年计划是不现实的和绝对主观的，因为这个计划将我国经济同南斯拉夫经济脱离开了等等。这给在贝拉特建立的宗派集团以极大帮助。在这种情况下，科奇·佐泽宗派集团用托洛茨基的方法在幕后同南共中央委员会的代表勾结，筹备了1948年2月举行的第八次全会。这是在贝拉特第二次全会后对于我党和阿尔巴尼亚的独立的最沉重的打击。会上打击了总书记并迫害了很多和他一起保卫党的同志，为南斯拉夫的公开干涉打开了大门。中央委员会所掌握的材料证明：科奇·佐泽为彻底达到其目的，加速了无中生有的审讯和捏造，对我们领导人进行人身消灭的准备工作。但是他没有达到这个目的。南斯拉夫人和他们的朋友开始公开谈论阿尔巴尼亚同南斯拉夫“合并”，将阿尔巴尼亚称为“南斯拉夫第七共和国”。科奇·佐泽宗派集团将这个问题向政治局提出了，但未获成功。1948年当铁托集团快被揭露的时候，南斯拉夫修正主义者为使阿尔巴尼亚合并于南斯拉夫成为既成事实，急迫地要求派遣几个南斯拉夫师来阿尔巴尼亚，名义是保卫我国和抵御希腊军队即将发动的侵略。但是我们党不顾南斯拉夫领导人和科奇·佐泽宗派集团的压力，没有接受这个做法。这一个历史性的决定从血泊中拯救了我国人民。很明显，假如以霍查同志为首的中央委员会的坚强的部分所领导的我们党没有进行抵抗，假如不是苏联共产党，假如情报局没有及时做出决议，我们党和国家的独立将会丧失。阿尔巴尼亚将成为南斯拉夫的辖区。正是这些把我们拯救了。因此，我们党和人民将苏共和苏联称为两次解放者，对他们怀着终身的感激。从这些事实中，可以清楚地看出：铁托最近的声明是多么无耻。他把南斯拉夫修正主义者称为维护社会主义国家间的正确关系的原则性论点而被迫害的“牺牲者”，把他们说成是“拯救社会主义免于腐化和混乱”的英雄。
    文章说，从这些事实中，可以看出南共领导人的说法对我们阿尔巴尼亚共产党人来说是多么荒谬。他们硬说，1948年对他们的态度是十分不正确的。1948年各国共产党和工人党对南共领导人的批评是完全正确的，符合事实的。因为南共领导人早就离开马克思列宁主义，而站在资产阶级民族主义的立场上，站在社会沙文主义立场上了。历史证明了这点。
    南共领导人尽管在1955年表面上同意并开始了同我国及各国党建立关系，但仍千方百计利用当时的形势实现他们的计划。南斯拉夫修正主义者利用对斯大林个人崇拜所进行的正确批评，作为破坏苏联和我们各国党威信的武器。但这是枉费心机的。因为正如苏共所说的斯大林是伟大的革命家和马克思主义者，对保卫和发展马克思列宁主义理论、对社会主义在苏联取得胜利、对苏联人民反对希特勒侵略者所取得的光辉胜利、对国际共产主义运动发展都有巨大的功绩。南斯拉夫修正主义者在“非斯大林主义”的旗帜下开始了真正的十字军东征，打击马克思列宁主义，破坏我们各国党和社会主义国家，分裂以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。铁托本人就曾号召推翻我们各国党和国家的领导人。在匈牙利发生流血事件时，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长向有关大使说：“你们等着吧，这样的事也将要在阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚发生”。铁托、卡德尔和南斯拉夫新闻界屡次地重复着这种挑衅。这些难道不是对我们内政的最无耻的干涉和破坏我们党的无耻阴谋吗？就在贝尔格莱德宣言以后，当铁托集团表示好像愿意改善和社会主义国家关系的时候，他们仍继续向阿尔巴尼亚运用一切压力，要我们党把南斯拉夫领导者所犯的反马克思主义的、沙文主义的严重错误清洗掉，要求恢复罪犯和叛徒科奇·佐泽的名誉。南斯拉夫报刊领导人展开了一个疯狂的反对我党的敌对运动。他们把阿尔巴尼亚的状况描写像地狱一样，说在阿尔巴尼亚笼罩着恐怖和贫困。他们号召起来推翻他们称之谓“斯大林主义的”党和人民民主制度，刊载许多诬蔑我们党和国家领导人的下流的诽谤的漫画。所有帝国主义国家的阿尔巴尼亚反动流亡分子的刊物和电台，随着南斯拉夫的刊物叫喊要我国人民起来推翻“反民主的斯大林主义的社会主义”、以“铁托的人道主义的社会主义”来取而代之。这并不是偶然的。他们竭力收集机会主义分子，被我们党开除的人和党的敌人来破坏党的团结，挑起人民对党的不满。为颠覆党和人民政权通过反党分子组织了阴谋活动。在地拉那党代表会议上所组织的进行敌对活动的里尼·格加和达里·思·得来集团、土·雅科法和彼得里·斯巴修集团等清楚地说明了这一点。我国的共产党员和人民完全有权问：为什么在南斯拉夫藏有三千多个阿尔巴尼亚逃犯，其中很多是法西斯罪犯？为什么南斯拉夫修正主义者竭力招募情报员收集有关我国的军事情报？
    南斯拉夫修正主义者不仅反对阿尔巴尼亚，而且分化和颠覆各兄弟党，阻挠它们为社会主义与和平的斗争。匈牙利反革命事件更明确地说明了南斯拉夫修正主义者们已变成了为从内部破坏我们的党和社会主义国家的美帝国主义者的最好的工具。南斯拉夫修正主义者们积极地参加了反革命事件的准备，进行了破坏匈牙利劳动人民党和国家的大规模的活动，以便怂恿敌对分子去反对它们。现在铁托集团在任何人面前已不能掩盖它对匈牙利和苏联人民的儿子为匈牙利事件而牺牲的责任。
    文章说，南斯拉夫修正主义不是偶然的现象，它是在一定的历史条件下产生的，它有它的客观基础。美帝国主义者和其他的帝国主义者，不惜他们的钱财，给了铁托集团达三十亿美元之多的重大“援助”。南斯拉夫修正主义就是在这个经济基础上发展和站住脚的，它在客观上在社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动中起了垄断资产阶级的代理人的作用。南斯拉夫修正主义者们为了掩盖他们的这一作用，以马克思列宁主义的辞句掩饰自己，说什么他们是在建设社会主义，但是社会主义永远是不能在反马克思主义的路线上、在修正主义者的领导下和在美帝国主义的帮助下建设起来的。南斯拉夫修正主义者已蜕变成为帝国主义政策服务的叛徒集团。南斯拉夫修正主义者的特点是用欺骗南斯拉夫人民的方法夺得了政权，现在他们不仅用宣传而且利用了国家政权所制造的一切手段和可能性来达到自己的目的。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟对我们党和国家的长久敌对活动、匈牙利的悲剧和一切反对其他兄弟党的活动，都清楚地说明了南斯拉夫修正主义者的危险作用。目前南斯拉夫修正主义所起的这个为帝国主义效劳的作用，只有故意闭起眼睛的人才看不到，我们马克思列宁主义政党，不能低估这个危险。我们马克思列宁主义政党正在坚决揭露现代修正主义，并将毫不妥协地继续进行斗争，直到它在理论上和政治上彻底毁灭为止。
    我们党对南共领导人一贯抱着马克思列宁主义正确态度，毫不动摇地向南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思主义、反社会主义的观点和活动进行斗争。我们党始终是忠于马克思列宁主义的，始终将我国人民的独立和自由作为最宝贵的东西加以保卫，始终同苏联和社会主义国家骨肉相连，我们党将继续坚决向现代修正主义进行斗争。
    现代修正主义者必将失败，因为马克思列宁主义力量、各国共产党的力量是不可摧毁的。
