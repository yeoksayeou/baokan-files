    新华社1日讯　苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办安东诺夫，今晚为以波布罗夫尼科夫为首的莫斯科市劳动者代表苏维埃代表团访问中国举行招待会。
    彭真市长等应邀出席了招待会。安东诺夫临时代办和波布罗夫尼科夫团长先后讲话，感谢中国主人对代表团的盛情款待。波布罗夫尼科夫团长说，代表团在中国到处都受到了最热情最友好的欢迎，这再一次证明了苏中两国的伟大友谊是牢不可破的。他对中国人民工农业建设大跃进作了很高的评价。他说，八年来，伟大的中国已经发生了巨大的变化，苏联人民从中国人民取得的辉煌成就中得到了巨大的鼓舞力量，并且祝中国人民在前进的道路上继续获得更大的成就。

    彭真市长提议为马克思列宁主义的胜利，为十月革命所开辟的道路干杯！
