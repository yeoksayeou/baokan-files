The "October" Agricultural Cooperative's Dining Hall
　　Nanjing Infantry School　Cao Zunbiao

Walking in the fields of the "October" Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanjing, you can feel the vitality everywhere. Golden wheat waves roll in the wind; lush green rice seedlings are planted in neat rows; the shouts of young men driving livestock come from this side; the loud songs of female cooperative members are sent from that side.

In the "October" Cooperative, whether you go to Dazhuang or Xiaocun, you will not see chicken droppings or cow dung. From the center of the street to the square, to every corner of the wall, everything is swept clean.

We heard that the "Xinhe" branch of the "October" Cooperative has four production teams that have started dining halls, so we came specifically to visit. We found the cooperative director, Wang Zhensheng, explained our intentions, and he introduced the situation of the cooperative-run dining halls in detail.

In the first quarter, a major production inspection was carried out, and it was found that the Xingjiatang production team had a lot of absenteeism. The main reason was that each family cooked at different times, and the cooperative members were tied down by housework, making it difficult to unify work hours, thus delaying work. At this time, team leader Xie Jiagui consulted with the party members and proposed the idea of ​​starting a dining hall. This proposal was not only supported by the party members but also unanimously supported by the cooperative members. The other teams also wanted to start dining halls when they heard the news. Speaking of this, Director Wang tapped his head and said, "I panicked at this moment! This is terrible! If the whole team stops cooking, it's not a joke. Besides, this will also form the idea of ​​'eating from the big pot,' cooking everything together in a muddle-headed way, and in the end, there will be no good results. At first, I wanted to use pressure to stop them, not allocating bricks for them to build stoves, but they still wanted to do it. I asked the district committee for instructions, and after research by the district committee, they said that if the masses have this kind of demand, we should actively support it and summarize experience from it." Wang Zhensheng paused and said, "Facts have proved that my thinking was too conservative. Since May 1st, it has been more than half a month, and these four dining halls are all doing very well. Several other teams are also preparing to open." We asked, "How do you solve the problem of the 'eating from the big pot' mentality?" He said, "This kind of concern is unnecessary. The dining halls are managed in an orderly manner, and grain coupons are issued according to each person's planned amount, so there will be no confusion at all."

Afterward, we came to Xingjiatang. As soon as we entered the village, we saw a white chimney standing tall on the roof of a thatched house. This is the dining hall. Going inside, we saw two slogans posted on the wide walls: "Participating in the dining hall has great benefits, making it convenient to hold meetings and study culture" and "Participating in the dining hall has many benefits, saving manpower and preventing fires. Eat according to plan every day to ensure that you don't exceed the monthly limit." A loudspeaker was hanging in the center of the thatched house, broadcasting beautiful songs. We arrived just in time for mealtime. The long counter was filled with plates of chrysanthemum greens, lettuce, and other side dishes.

Cooperative member Xia Shipeng's family, two adults and five children, occupied a table and were eating porridge. We asked him how the dining hall was doing, and he nodded repeatedly, praising, "Very good! Very good! In the past, my family relied on this girl to cook, and she was young and would either burn herself or scald herself, making it impossible for us to work in the fields with peace of mind. After returning from work, we still had to fetch water and chop firewood..." At this time, Luo Deben, a seventy-year-old man sitting next to him, interjected, "I am an old bachelor and graze cattle for the cooperative. In the past, I always ate cold food and drank cold drinks, but now I can eat hot meals every time." In addition to those who were seated, some people were carrying furniture to get food to take back to eat. Everyone lined up in order, without any confusion.

There are three types of food available at the counter: dry rice, porridge, and rice with vegetables. The vegetables range from five cents to one cent. A wooden board with a "Menu" is hanging on the wall. If you want to eat something, just hang your name tag on the board, and the dining hall will make it. When the time comes, use food coupons and vegetable coupons to buy it.

The dining hall is directly managed by Xia Shixie, the deputy leader of the production team. According to him, the dining hall has to provide meals for 168 people in the team, but there are only three staff members. One is the quartermaster and cook, one is the receptionist and cook, and one is the accountant and cook. In this way, many of the semi-laborers in the team who could only cook have been saved, and they have now been organized to run nurseries or engage in sideline production such as weaving straw sandals. At the same time, because the dining hall controls all the grain in the team and distributes it uniformly, it also solves the problem of grain shortages at the end of the month due to lack of planning. Cooperative members Xia Zhongtang and Wang Xueqing used to eat grain without a plan and were always nervous. Now, they participate in the dining hall and use the issued grain coupons in a planned way. If they eat too much, it will be deducted from their work points. In this way, their lives are guaranteed, and they will no longer be demoralized and affect their attendance. We asked Comrade Xia Shixie, "What if a family has relatives visiting and wants to make something good to eat?" He said, "In addition to the basic grain coupons that should be distributed, each person also has work-point grain coupons, which can be used to entertain guests. If you are on vacation or sick and don't want to eat in the dining hall, you can exchange grain coupons for grain to take back." Then, he said, "At present, our dining hall is a 'free dining hall.' Cooperative members can sell the vegetables from their private plots to the dining hall. Next year, we want to gradually become a 'collective dining hall.' With the voluntary participation of the cooperative members, we will concentrate the private plots and pig raising, and organize all the elderly and semi-laborers to grow vegetables and raise pigs. At that time, our dining hall will be even better!"…

It was getting late, and our visit also came to an end. On the way back, we talked excitedly, and we sincerely blessed our peasant brothers.

    “十月”农业社的食堂
    南京步兵学校　曹尊标
    走在南京市郊“十月”农业社的田野上，你会感觉到，这里处处充满着活力。金色的麦浪随风滚动；葱绿的秧苗一片一洼；这边传来小伙子们赶牲口的?喝声；那边送过女社员们嘹亮的歌唱声。
    在“十月”社，不论你走进大庄、小村，总看不到鸡屎、牛粪。从街心到广场，到每一个墙角，都打扫得一干二净。
    听说“十月”社的“新合”分社有四个生产队都办起了食堂，我们是特意来参观的。我们找到社主任王振生，说明来意后，他详细地介绍了社办食堂的情况。
    第一季度，进行了一次生产大检查，发现杏家塘生产队缺勤很多。原因主要是各家烧饭迟早不一，社员们受家务牵扯，上下工时间很难统一，因此耽搁了功夫。这时，队长谢家贵就找党员们商量，提出了办食堂的事。这一提，不光党员赞成，社员们也一致拥护。其余几个队听到办食堂的消息，也跟着要办。谈到这里，王主任敲敲自己的脑袋说：“这一下我慌了，这还了得！弄不好全队一停伙，可不是闹着玩的。再说，这也会形成‘吃大锅饭’的思想，糊里糊涂一锅煮，到头来没有好收场。开始，我想用压的办法，不拨给他们做灶用的砖，可他们还是要办。去请示区委，经区委研究以后，说群众有这种要求，就应当积极支持，从中总结经验。”王振生停了停，说：“事实证明，是我的思想太保守了。从5月1日起，已经半个多月了，这四个食堂都很好。还有几个队也预备开办。”我们问：“产生了‘吃大锅饭’思想怎么解决？”他说：“这种顾虑是多余的，食堂搞得有条有理，按每人的计划量发粮票，根本不会发生混乱的。”
    随后，我们来到了杏家塘。一进村，就见一座草房顶上高高立起一个白烟囱，这就是食堂。进去一看，宽大的墙壁上贴着两条标语：“参加食堂好处大，便利开会学文化”、“参加食堂好处多，节省人力又防火。每天按照计划吃，保证月月不超过”。草屋正中悬着扩音器，正在播送优美的歌曲。我们来时，正赶上开饭。长柜台上摆满了一碟碟菊花菜、莴笋等小菜。
    社员夏仕鹏一家，两个大人、五个小孩，占据了一桌，正在吃稀饭。我们问他食堂办得怎么样，他连连点头称赞说：“很好！很好！过去我家就靠这个女孩子做饭，她年纪小，不是烧伤就是烫伤，弄得我们在地里劳动也放不下心。干活回来还得去挑水，劈木柴。……”这时，邻座七十多岁的罗德本大爷插嘴说：“我是个孤老头子，给社里放牛。过去总是吃冷的喝冷的，现时我餐餐都能吃热的了。”除了就座的人以外，还有些人提着家具来打饭回去吃。大家都依先后为序，一点也不紊乱。
    柜台上有干饭、稀饭、菜饭三种。菜从五分钱到一分钱的都有。墙上挂着一块“饭菜一览表”的木板。你想吃什么，就把自己的姓名牌挂在木板上，食堂就会照做。到时候，用饭票、菜票去买。
    食堂由生产队副队长夏士燮直接掌握。据他介绍：食堂要供给本队一百六十八个人吃饭，可是只有三名工作人员。一个是司务长兼炊事员，一个是招待员兼炊事员，一个是会计兼炊事员。这样一来，队里原先许多只能烧饭的半劳动力便节省出来了，现在已经把她们组织起来，办托儿所，或是从事编草鞋等副业生产。同时，由于食堂掌握全队粮食，统一调配，还解决了由于不会计划而月终缺粮的问题。社员夏仲堂、王学青过去吃粮无计划，总是紧张。现在，他们参加食堂，按发给的粮票有计划地使用。吃超过了，要在工分里扣除。这样，他们生活便有保证了，再也不至因此情绪低落，而影响出工了。我们问夏士燮同志“如果谁家来了亲友，想做点好的吃怎么办？”他说：“除了应分得的基本粮票以外，每人还有工分粮票，可以用来待客。要是你休假，或是生病，不想在食堂吃饭，可以拿粮票换粮食回去。”接着，他又说：“现时，我们的食堂是‘自由食堂’，社员们私留地上的菜可以卖给食堂。到明年，我们想逐步变成‘集体食堂’。取得社员们自愿，把私留地、养猪都集中起来，把老人和半劳力全组织起来种菜、养猪。到那一阵，我们食堂就会办得更好！”……
    天晚了，我们的访问也结束了。归途中，我们兴奋地交谈着，我们衷心地向农民兄弟祝福。
