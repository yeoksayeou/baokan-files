    Intensify Pruning and Pinching of Cotton Plants with Damaged Buds

    Recently, in many cotton-growing areas, a phenomenon of "damaged buds" (where the terminal bud is bitten off, called "male cotton" by some cotton farmers) has occurred in cotton plants, especially in early-sown cotton fields where the rate of damaged buds is even higher. If these cotton plants with damaged buds are not remedied in time, they will grow wildly, producing few or no cotton bolls.

    The damaged bud phenomenon is mainly caused by two types of pests: thrips and mirid bugs. The newly hatched larvae of thrips often harm the cotton plants near the growing point, causing the cotton plants to produce many new tender buds around the growing point. Mirid bugs harm the cotton plants during the early stage of true leaf growth, similarly leading to this phenomenon. Because thrips are very small, their newly hatched larvae are only the size of a pinhead, making them difficult to detect. Mirid bug adults also fly away after harming the cotton plants, so one often only sees the damaged cotton buds without seeing the harmful insects.

    Taking prompt measures to control pests with pesticides in the early stages of an infestation is a fundamental solution, but it is too late by the time the cotton seedlings are thinned. The only way to salvage the situation now is to immediately intensify pruning and pinching. The method is as follows: first, completely remove the thick and tender green branches on the cotton plants with damaged buds, as these tender branches are mostly unproductive runaway shoots; appropriately retain or completely retain the short and thin brown branches. In the past, some areas only kept one branch, but experience has shown that it is far better to retain more or all of the normally growing branches. At the same time, the terminal buds of the retained branches should be pinched off as early as possible to promote the early growth of normal fruiting branches. Numerous experiences have proven that after such remedial measures, the loss of cotton plants with damaged buds not producing bolls or producing few bolls can be recovered.

### 对破头棉株抓紧整枝摘心

    对破头棉株抓紧整枝摘心
    最近各棉区不少棉株发生破头（顶芽被咬坏有些地区棉农叫“公棉花”）现象，特别是早播的棉田破头率更大。这些破头棉株如不及时补救，将形成疯长，很少结铃或不结铃。
    破头现象主要是蓟马和盲椿象两种害虫引起的。蓟马的初孵幼虫常在棉株生长点附近为害，使棉株在生长点四周生出许多新的嫩芽；盲椿象在真叶初生时期为害，也同样形成这种现象。由于蓟马虫体很小，它的初孵幼虫只有针尖大小，很难发现；盲椿象成虫为害棉株后，也远走他飞，所以往往是只见棉花破头，看不到为害的虫子。
    在虫害发生早期就抓紧用药防治是一个根本办法，棉花定苗就来不及了。目前唯一的挽救方法就是立即抓紧整枝摘心。方法是：先把破头棉株上生长粗大、茎色青嫩的枝条彻底去掉，因为这些嫩枝条多是不能正常生长的疯杈；把生长短细、茎色棕褐的枝条适当多留或全部留下来。过去有的地区只留一个枝条，根据经验，那样做远不如将生长正常的枝条适当多留或全部留下为好。同时要把留下来枝条的顶心及早摘掉，促其及早生出正常的果枝。许多经验证明，经过这样补救，可以挽回破头棉株不结铃或少结铃的损失。
