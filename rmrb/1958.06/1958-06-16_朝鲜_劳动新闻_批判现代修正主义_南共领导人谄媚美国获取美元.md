Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th: The North Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on June 14th entitled "Struggling Against Modern Revisionism is the Sacred Duty of All Communists," stating that revisionism is the main danger in the current international communist and workers' movement.

The editorial said that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia concentrated the great achievements of modern revisionism and became a typical example of modern revisionism. The international communist movement demands the complete eradication of modern revisionism. Maintaining the purity of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism under such conditions is the sacred duty of every communist.

The editorial pointed out that the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not accept the highly principled criticism of its draft program by the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, did not correct their mistakes, and did not abandon their anti-Marxist-Leninist stand. On the contrary, it adopted this revisionist program at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and accused the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries of "interfering in internal affairs" with their comradely criticism. From this point, it can be clearly seen that they have lost the qualities of communists.

The editorial pointed out that the criticism of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia by the Communist and Workers' Party Information Bureau in 1948 was completely justified and most practical, and when the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is made public today, this criticism is particularly appropriate. The editorial pointed out that the program formulated by the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia starts from ignoring the basic contradictions of social development, and "evaluates" the current international situation and the Soviet Union's foreign policy; it negates the socialist revolution and puts forward the fallacy of the "peaceful growth" of capitalism into socialism; distorts the role of the Communist Party and socialist countries, revises the principle of proletarian internationalism; and arbitrarily distorts and revises some important issues in the development of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the world communist movement. The editorial believes that this revisionist program is obviously beneficial to international imperialism, which is frantically attempting to slander and harm Marxism-Leninism. The editorial said that the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, with the aim of disintegrating the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp, carried out malicious slander and vilification of the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party and the Workers' Party. They attempted to use the same yardstick to measure the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the US imperialist foreign policy, and blamed the Soviet Union for the current international tensions. When friends of peace, democracy and socialism regard the Soviet Union as a strong fortress of socialism, a reliable defender of the freedom and independence of all countries, and a banner of peace, the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, who claim to be communists, have done such a thing.

The editorial said that their treacherous behavior did not start today, but long ago, they stood on the position of "anti-Soviet and anti-communist."

The editorial strongly condemned the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia for describing the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary as a "revolution," maliciously vilifying the Soviet army's noble assistance in helping Hungary maintain socialist achievements and eliminate the danger of a new war as "interference," and sheltering the reactionary position of the renegades of the Nagy clique. The editorial pointed out that this practice of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is an attempt to split Hungary from the socialist camp and make it join hands with imperialism.

The editorial exposed the essence of Yugoslavia's so-called "neutral" stance. The editorial said that Yugoslavia claims a "neutral" foreign policy, but often takes actions that are beneficial to the imperialists. When the US imperialists gathered the aggressors of fifteen countries to invade our country, Yugoslavia adopted a "neutral" attitude. When all good people in the world shouted "US imperialism get out of Korea!", we did not hear the leaders of Yugoslavia utter a single word of accusation against the imperialists. How can this be said to be the attitude of a communist!?

The editorial said that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia even believe that the long-delayed unification of Korea, Germany, and Vietnam today is the result of the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States for "hegemony." Don't they know the ironclad fact that the aggressive policy of the United States has made it impossible for Korea, Germany, and Vietnam to achieve unification? The editorial said that the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should know that their absurd line is accommodating the aggressive policy of the international reactionaries headed by the United States, and giving them encouragement.

The editorial said that at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia made a point of discrediting the socialist camp, but did not utter a single word of accusation against the most ferocious enemies of peace and socialism—the US imperialists and international imperialism. Instead, they vigorously praised the "assistance" given to them by the United States, and made various ugly gestures to curry favor, attempting to obtain "new assistance" from the United States.

The editorial said that we deeply know the inside story of US "aid" through the reality of South Korea, so we can also understand what the "aid" given to Yugoslavia by the United States means.

A commentary in the London "Sunday Times" also revealed this inside story, saying that today Yugoslavia's "secretly implemented capitalist economy is beginning to form a welfare state according to the Western principle of profit-making."

The editorial said that the treacherous behavior of modern revisionism reminds us of Lenin's comment on Kautsky, who beautified and whitewashed bourgeois democracy, as early as 1918: "Oh, what a subtle servile attitude to curry favor with the bourgeoisie! Oh, what a humble and civilized way to lick the capitalists' boots!" The editorial said that the imperialist aggressive groups today are trying to maintain and beautify the collapsing capitalism through such "socialists," and to disintegrate the socialist camp countries from within. However, as in the past, their wishful thinking will surely end in bankruptcy.

The editorial pointed out that the particular danger of Yugoslav revisionists lies in the fact that they occupy a dominant position in the ruling party. They adopt anti-Marxist domestic and foreign policies, lead the Yugoslav people astray, and poison the international revolutionary movement.

The editorial emphasized that Marxist-Leninist masters have always attached paramount importance to the struggle to maintain the purity of scientific communist ideology, and they have waged an irreconcilable struggle against opportunists. Lenin angrily denounced all kinds of reformists and branded them as slaves of the bourgeoisie.

The editorial finally said that the Workers' Party of Korea, which is loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, has unswervingly followed the path pointed out by Marx, Engels, and Lenin since the day it was founded; in the difficult period when the enemy's provocative offensive against the socialist camp in recent years has become more fierce, it has also taken the same steps as the fraternal parties and waged a resolute struggle against the conspiracies of the imperialists and opportunists. Despite the various conspiracies of the enemy, our party is organizationally and ideologically more united than ever around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and is victoriously leading the Korean revolution.

The editorial said that our party and the Korean people, who have experienced the great vitality of socialism through their own lives, will wage a relentless struggle to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, oppose any slight manifestation of revisionism and the erosion of revisionism in the party, and will defend the unity of the international communist and workers' movement centered on the Soviet Union like defending their own eyes, and will be loyal to it to the end.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”批判现代修正主义
    南共领导人谄媚美国获取美元
   各国人民把苏联当作社会主义的强大堡垒和和平旗手，而南共领导人却一再对它中伤和诽谤；苏军帮助匈牙利维护社会主义成果，而南共领导人则庇护纳吉之流变节者；当美国纠集其仆从侵略朝鲜的时候，南共领导人对美帝国主义连一言半语的指责都没有。
    新华社平壤14日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”14日发表的题为“同现代修正主义进行斗争是一切共产主义者的神圣义务”的社论指出，修正主义是目前国际共产主义和工人运动中的主要的危险。
    社论说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案集中了现代修正主义的大成，并且成为现代修正主义的典型。国际共产主义运动要求彻底根除现代修正主义。在这样的条件下维护革命的马克思列宁主义的纯洁性是每一个共产主义者的神圣义务。
    社论指出，南共领导集团没有接受以苏联共产党为首的各国共产党和工人党对它的纲领草案进行的有高度原则的批判，没有纠正他们的错误，没有抛弃他们的反马克思列宁主义的立场。相反地却在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上通过了这一修正主义的纲领，并且指责各国共产党和工人党对他们提出的同志式的批判是“干涉内政”。从这一点就可以清楚地看出，他们已经丧失了共产主义者的品质。
    社论指出，1948年共产党与工人党情报局对南共领导人的批评是完全正当和最切合实际的，而当今天南共纲领公诸于世的时候，就特别感觉到这个批评是很恰当的。社论指出，南共领导集团制定的纲领从漠视社会发展的基本矛盾出发，对目前国际局势和苏联的对外政策加以“评价”；它否定社会主义革命，提出资本主义向社会主义“和平生长”的谬论；歪曲共产党和社会主义国家的作用，修正无产阶级国际主义的原则；对马克思列宁主义理论发展和世界共产主义运动实践方面的一些重要问题擅自加以歪曲和修正。社论认为，这种修正主义的纲领显然有利于疯狂地企图诬蔑和损害马克思列宁主义的国际帝国主义。社论说，南共领导集团以瓦解社会主义阵营的统一和团结为目的，对工人阶级的先锋队——共产党和工人党进行充满恶意的中伤和诽谤。他们企图用同一个天平来衡量苏联的和平对外政策和美帝国主义的对外政策，并且把目前国际局势紧张的原因归咎于苏联。当和平、民主和社会主义的朋友们都把苏联看作是社会主义的强大堡垒，各国人民的自由、独立的可靠的维护者和和平旗手的时候，以共产主义者自居的南共领导人竟干出这样的勾当来。
    社论说，他们的这种背信弃义的行为不是从今天才开始的，而是在很久以前，他们就站在“反苏反共”的立场上。
    社论强烈谴责南共领导集团把匈牙利的反革命暴乱说成是“革命”，恶毒地把苏联军队帮助匈牙利维护社会主义成果、消除新战争危险的高贵援助诬蔑为“干涉”，并且庇护纳吉之流的变节者的反动立场。社论指出，南共领导集团的这种做法，是企图把匈牙利从社会主义阵营中分裂出去，并且使它同帝国主义携手。
    社论揭穿了南斯拉夫标榜的所谓“中立”立场的实质。社论说，南斯拉夫标榜“中立”的对外政策，但却经常采取对帝国主义者有利的行动。在美帝国主义者纠集十五个国家的侵略者向我国进行侵略时，南斯拉夫采取了“中立”的态度。在世界上一切善良的人们高呼“美帝国主义从朝鲜滚出去！”的时候，我们没有听到南斯拉夫领导人对帝国主义者加以一言半语的指责。这怎么能够说得上是共产主义者的态度！？
    社论说，南共领导人甚至还认为今天朝鲜、德国、越南迟迟未能统一是苏联和美国争取“霸权”的斗争的结果。由于美国的侵略政策才使朝鲜、德国、越南还没有能够实现统一的铁一般的事实，难道他们不知道吗？社论说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导集团应该知道，他们的这种荒唐路线是迁就以美国为首的国际反动派的侵略政策，并且给他们以鼓舞。
    社论说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导集团在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上，以诋毁社会主义阵营为能事，而对和平和社会主义的最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义者和国际帝国主义，不仅没有一句指责，却大肆赞扬美国给予他们的“援助”，并且作出各种丑态来献媚，企图取得美国的“新的援助”。
    社论说，我们通过南朝鲜的现实，深深地知道美国“援助”的内幕，从而我们也可以理解美国给予南斯拉夫的“援助”意味着什么。
    伦敦“星期日泰晤士报”的评论也道出了这个内幕，它说，今天南斯拉夫“暗地里实行的资本主义经济，正在根据西方获取利润的原则开始形成一个福利国家”。
    社论说，现代修正主义的变节行为使我们想起列宁早在1918年对美化和粉饰资产阶级民主的考茨基的评语：“唔，好一个向资产阶级纤巧献媚的奴仆态度！唔，好一个卑躬屈膝替资本家舐皮靴的文明样子！”社论说，帝国主义侵略集团今天企图通过这类“社会主义者”来维持和美化正在崩溃中的资本主义，并且从内部瓦解社会主义阵营国家。但是，也像过去一样，他们的这种如意算盘一定会遭到破产的结果。
    社论指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者的特别的危险性在于，他们在执政党内占有统治地位，他们采取反马克思主义的对内外政策，把南斯拉夫人民引入歧途，并且给予国际革命运动以毒害。
    社论强调指出，马克思列宁主义大师对维护科学共产主义思想的纯洁性而进行的斗争经常赋予头等重要的意义，他们同机会主义者进行不调和的斗争。列宁极其愤怒地斥责了各种改良主义者，并且给他们打上了资产阶级奴仆的烙印。
    社论最后说，忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的朝鲜劳动党，从建党的那一天起就始终不渝地沿着马克思、恩格斯、列宁所指出的道路前进；在敌人最近几年来对社会主义阵营发动的挑衅性攻势更加猛烈的艰苦时期，也同各兄弟党采取同一步调，为反对帝国主义者和机会主义者的阴谋进行了坚决的斗争。尽管有敌人进行各种阴谋活动，我们的党在组织上、思想上、进一步坚如磐石地团结在以金日成同志为首的党中央委员会的周围，正在胜利地领导着朝鲜革命。
    社论说，通过自己的生活而体验到社会主义伟大生命力的我们的党和朝鲜人民，为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，反对修正主义的任何微小表现和修正主义对党内的侵蚀，将进行无情的斗争，并且将像保卫自己的眼珠一样，保卫以苏联为中心的国际共产主义和工人运动的团结一致，并且对它忠诚到底。
