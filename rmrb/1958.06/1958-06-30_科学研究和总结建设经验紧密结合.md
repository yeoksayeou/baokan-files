The Agricultural Water Conservancy Research Office of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, in order to closely integrate scientific research with national construction and serve it, has designated "Summarizing the mass experience and scientific integration in water conservancy construction in Xiangyang Prefecture to promote water conservancy construction and agricultural production development" as its central task for this year. This is to ensure that research results play a practical role in the upcoming peak of farmland water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, while also enriching scientific research content and improving scientific research standards and teaching quality.

In recent months, batches of teachers from the institute have gone to Guanghua, Junxian, and other places in this prefecture to conduct field research and technical guidance, and participate in relevant conferences held by the province and prefecture. Based on actual data and needs, they have comprehensively summarized ten issues in three aspects for special research. Among them, there are four issues related to the impact of water and soil improvement and the widespread construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects on runoff: research on water source estimation; summary and research on several planning and design issues of irrigation and drainage systems in mountainous and hilly areas; summary and research on several issues in the management of irrigation canal systems; and research on irrigation water use and groundwater exploration in conglomerate areas. There are also four issues related to hydraulic structures of medium and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects: investigation and research on reservoir discharge structures; investigation and research on several hydraulic structures based on the principle of "running water conservancy with diligence and thrift"; field research on the suitable location and inlet form of dam-free inlets based on the inlet of the Seventy-Two Weirs in Nanzhang; and the design and trial production of simple instruments for quality control of earthwork. There are two issues related to semi-mechanization of construction and tools: research on construction machinery and tools created by the masses themselves in water conservancy construction; and research on semi-mechanized construction of small-scale hydraulic tunnels. The research on these issues is of great significance not only to Hubei but also to the national farmland water conservancy construction cause.

The Party and administration of the institute have given great importance and support to this work, and organized professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and graduate students from the teaching and research groups of water and soil improvement, construction organization and mechanization, hydraulic structures, hydrology, building materials, hydrogeology, and foundation engineering, etc., to carry out the work.

At present, with the cooperation and assistance of local Party committees and water conservancy departments at all levels, the research work is being carried out rapidly. In order to achieve results before this autumn, many teachers have gone to Xiangyang Prefecture for field work and set up runoff observation stations; some have gone to Beijing, Henan, and other places to collect data. The research method embodies the spirit of "three combinations" of production, research, and teaching, going beyond the scope of laboratories and research rooms, and focusing on directly going into the field to work.

    科学研究和总结建设经验紧密结合
    武汉水利学院农田水利研究室为了使科学研究工作紧密结合并服务于国家建设，特将“总结襄阳专区兴修水利中的群众经验与科学结合，以促进水利建设和农业生产的发展”作为今年的中心任务。这样做是为了使研究成果在今冬明春的农田水利建设高潮中发挥实际作用，同时为了丰富科学研究内容并提高科学研究水平和教学质量。
    近几个月来，该院成批的教师前往这个专区的光化、均县等地进行实地研究和技术指导，参加省、专区召开的有关会议，根据实际资料和需要，综合归纳为三个方面的十个问题，进行专题研究。其中属于水利土壤改良和小型农田水利工程普遍兴建后，对径流的影响方面的问题有四个：即关于水源估算问题的研究；山丘地区灌溉排水系统几个规划设计问题的总结和研究；灌溉渠系管理中若干问题的总结和研究；关于砾岩区灌溉用水、地下水源的探测研究。属于中、小型农田水利工程水工建筑物方面的问题也有四个，即：水库放水建筑物的调查研究；根据“勤俭办水利”的方针，对几个水工建筑物的调查研究；根据南漳七十二堰进水口对无坝引水口适宜位置和进水口形式的实地研究；关于土方工程质量控制简易仪器的设计和试制。属于施工和工具半机械化方面的问题有两个，即：水利建设中群众自己创造的施工机械和施工工具的研究；小型水工隧洞半机械化施工的研究。这些问题的研究不仅对湖北，就是对全国的农田水利建设事业来说，都具有重大意义。
    学院的党和行政对这项工作给予了巨大的重视和支持，组织了水利土壤改良、施工组织与机械化、水工结构、水文学、建筑材料、水文地质和地基基础等教研组的教授、讲师、助教、研究生等几十人的力量进行工作。
    目前，在地方各级党委和水利部门的配合协助下，研究工作正迅速开展中。为了争取在今年秋季以前取得成果，不少教师已经前往襄阳专区实地工作，设立了径流观测站；有的则到北京、河南等地搜集资料。在研究方法上体现了生产、研究、教学“三结合”的精神，越出了试验室和研究室的范围，以直接深入现场进行工作为主。　（育）
