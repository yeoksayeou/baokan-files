　　The State Council's Regulations on Improving the Tax Administration System
　　(Approved at the 75th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on April 11, 1958)
    (Approved at the 97th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on June 5, 1958)
    Taxation is a major way for the state to mobilize socialist accumulation funds and a way to distribute the wealth created by the people. If this distribution is carried out appropriately, it can promote the development of production; conversely, if it is carried out inappropriately, whether taxes are levied on those who should be exempt, too much tax is levied on those who should be taxed less, or no tax is levied on those who should be taxed, or too little tax is levied on those who should be taxed more, it will hinder the development of production. At present, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically completed, and industrial and agricultural production is developing rapidly. The financial management system and the industrial and commercial management systems have been improved. In order to carry out tax work correctly and in a timely and appropriate manner, it is also necessary to make corresponding improvements to the state's tax administration system. The principle of improvement is: all taxes that can be managed by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be handed over to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government for management; for some taxes that are still managed by the central government, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be given the power to make flexible adjustments within a certain scope; and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be allowed to formulate tax measures and levy regional taxes. In this way, it will be conducive to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, under the unified leadership of the central government, to better use taxation as a tool to take necessary measures of encouragement and restriction according to the actual local situation, promote the development of production, consolidate the socialist economy, and open up financial resources and increase accumulation on the basis of production development. The following provisions are now made for improving the tax administration system:
    1. Stamp tax, interest income tax, slaughter tax, livestock transaction tax, urban real estate tax, cultural and entertainment tax, vehicle and vessel usage license tax, and other seven types of taxes have been classified as fixed local income in accordance with the provisions for improving the financial management system. The management authority related to these taxes should also be handed over to the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government at the same time. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have the right to take measures to reduce, exempt, or increase taxes on the basis of the unified central tax regulations, according to the actual local situation; and have the right to make necessary adjustments to the tax items and tax rates of these taxes.
    2. Commodity circulation tax, goods tax, business tax, and income tax have been classified as regulatory sharing income in accordance with the provisions for improving the financial management system, and are shared by the central and local governments according to a certain proportion. The management authority related to these taxes is still basically centralized under the central government. However, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government are also allowed to implement measures to reduce or exempt taxes within the scope stipulated below, and can also implement measures to increase taxes.
    (1) The scope for provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to implement tax reductions or exemptions is stipulated as follows:
    1. New products trial-produced by industry and handicrafts and products produced by newly built enterprises, if paying taxes in accordance with tax laws will result in losses during the trial production period and the initial production period.
    2. Finished products processed and produced by industry and handicrafts using substitutes, waste products, or substandard and deteriorated goods as raw materials, which need to be encouraged in terms of taxation.
    3. The manufacturing of parts and components by industry and handicrafts is to assist another enterprise in production and needs to be taken care of in terms of taxation.
    4. Enterprises and institutions need to take care of taxation in order to help agriculture, cultivate and supply seeds, breeding livestock, young livestock, fish fry, etc., or to set up processing points in mountainous areas for operation in coordination with the development of mountainous areas.
    5. Agricultural products and sideline products produced by agricultural production cooperatives, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers that should be taxed according to regulations, for their own use or for sale to the free market, need to be taken care of in terms of taxation.
    6. Handicraft production cooperatives and cooperative shops need to be taken care of in terms of taxation because their annual business income is not enough to pay the wages of employees due to special reasons.
    7. Agricultural production cooperatives, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers in disaster areas are engaged in temporary industrial, handicraft, and transportation activities for self-help production, or commercial enterprises in disaster areas are engaged in certain unprofitable operations to cooperate with disaster relief work, or social relief departments organize family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the elderly, weak, and disabled who have difficulty in life to carry out production for self-sufficiency, and engage in industrial, handicraft, and transportation activities, which need to be taken care of in terms of taxation.
    (2) The scope for provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to implement tax increases is stipulated as follows:
    1. For a small number of individual handicraft workers and small vendors with relatively high incomes, an additional 10% to 50% can be levied on their taxable income tax (for example, if the taxable income tax is 10 yuan, an additional 1 to 5 yuan can be levied). Individual cases with particularly high profits can exceed this limit.
    For various cooperative organizations engaged in handicrafts, commerce, etc., a small number of those with particularly high incomes can also be levied an appropriate additional percentage on their taxable income tax.
    2. For remaining capitalist industrialists and merchants, an additional 10% to 100% can be levied on their taxable income tax or temporary business tax. Individual cases with particularly high profits can exceed this limit.
    3. In terms of agricultural tax, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should make necessary adjustments to the burden between their respective regions, the burden between planting food crops and planting cash crops, and the burden between agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers, in accordance with the Agricultural Tax Regulations of the People's Republic of China and in combination with the actual situation.
    4. In terms of salt tax, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government are allowed to make necessary adjustments to the salt tax amount on the basis of the original tax collection methods, according to the actual situation, and report to the State Council for the record.
    5. When necessary, the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government may include certain local specialties and sideline products with relatively high profits (including products of the collective economy and products of the individual economy) into the scope of goods tax collection, as a newly added tax item, to collect goods tax; or formulate other tax measures to levy regional taxes, in order to regulate the income of producers, balance the burden, open up financial resources, or to plan production and restrict blind production and operation. Adding tax items for goods tax on local specialties and sideline products, or formulating tax measures for local specialties and sideline products, should be reported to the State Council for the record.
    6. Autonomous regions should be given greater flexibility in tax administration. If the People's Committee of an autonomous region believes that the unified national tax law is not suitable for the actual situation of the autonomous region, it can formulate its own tax measures and report to the State Council for the record.
    7. The People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, in accordance with the principles of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, and increasing state accumulation, may flexibly handle the provisions on the collection links and thresholds for industrial and commercial taxes, if they believe that they are indeed unreasonable and unfavorable to production, and report to the Ministry of Finance for the record after handling.
    8. The People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should pay attention to the following points when implementing these regulations:
    (1) Taking measures to reduce or exempt taxes should take into account both the needs of developing production and the accumulation of state funds.
    (2) Taking measures to adjust tax rates or increase taxes should pay attention to not affecting the normal development of production and the stability of prices.
    (3) The measures taken by various regions in terms of taxation that are closely related to neighboring regions should be jointly negotiated in advance to achieve mutual cooperation.
    (4) The measures taken by various regions in terms of taxation that have a greater impact on unified planning and national balance, or involve foreign relations, should be reported to the State Council for approval.

　　国务院关于改进税收管理体制的规定
　　（一九五八年四月十一日国务院全体会议第七十五次会议通过）
    （一九五八年六月五日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十七次会议批准）
    税收是国家动员社会主义资金积累的一种主要方式，也是对于人民所创造的财富的一种分配方式。这种分配进行得适当，可以促进生产的发展；反之，如果进行得不适当，无论应当免税的征了税，应当少征税的多征了税，或者应当征税的没有征税，应当多征税的少征了税，都会妨碍生产的发展。目前生产资料所有制的社会主义改造已经基本完成，工农业生产正在飞跃发展，财政管理体制和工业、商业管理体制已经有了改进，为了正确地、因时因地制宜地进行税收工作，国家的税收管理体制，也有必要作相应的改进。改进的原则是：凡是可以由省、自治区、直辖市负责管理的税收，应当交给省、自治区、直辖市管理；若干仍然由中央管理的税收，在一定的范围内，给省、自治区、直辖市以机动调整的权限；并且允许省、自治区、直辖市制定税收办法，开征地区性的税收。这样，就有利于省、自治区、直辖市在中央的统一领导下，根据当地的实际情况，更好地运用税收这一工具，采取必要的鼓励和限制的措施，促进生产的发展，巩固社会主义经济，并且在生产发展的基础上，开辟财源，增加积累。现在对改进税收管理体制，作如下的规定：
    一、印花税、利息所得税、屠宰税、牲畜交易税、城市房地产税、文化娱乐税、车船使用牌照税等七种税收，按照改进财政管理体制的规定，已经划为地方固定收入。有关这些税收的管理权限，也应当同时交给省、自治区、直辖市掌握。省、自治区、直辖市在中央统一的征税条例的基础上，根据当地实际情况，有权采取减税、免税或者加税的措施；有权对这些税收的税目和税率作必要的调整。
    二、商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税等四种税收，按照改进财政管理体制的规定，已经划为调剂分成收入，根据一定的比例，由中央和地方实行分成。有关这些税收的管理权限，仍然基本上归中央集中掌握。但是对于这些税收，也允许省、自治区、直辖市在下列规定的范围内，根据实际情况，实行减税、免税的措施，也可以实行加税的措施。
    （一）省、自治区、直辖市可以实行减税或者免税的范围规定如下：
    1、工业、手工业试制的新产品和新建企业所生产的产品，在试制期间和生产初期，如果按照税法规定纳税会发生亏损的。
    2、工业、手工业利用代用品、废品或者残次变质物品作原料，加工生产的成品，需要在税收上给予鼓励的。
    3、工业、手工业制造零件、配件，是为了协助另一企业进行生产，需要在税收上给予照顾的。
    4、企业事业单位为了帮助农业，培育和供应种子、种畜、幼畜、鱼苗等，或者为了配合开发山区，在山区设点加工，进行经营，需要在税收上给予照顾的。
    5、农业生产合作社、农业生产合作社社员、个体农民自己生产的按照规定应当纳税的农业产品和副业产品，供自己使用或者向自由市场出卖，需要在税收上给予照顾的。
    6、手工业生产合作社和合作商店，由于特殊原因，全年营业收入不足以支付从业人员的工资，需要在税收上给予照顾的。
    7、灾区的农业生产合作社、农业生产合作社社员、个体农民为了生产自救，从事临时性的工业、手工业、贩运活动，或者灾区的商业企业为了配合救灾工作，进行某些无利的经营，或者社会救济部门组织生活困难的烈士家属、军人家属、荣誉军人和老弱残废进行生产自给，从事工业、手工业、贩运活动，需要在税收上给予照顾的。
    （二）省、自治区、直辖市可以实行加税的范围规定如下：
    1、对于少数收入较多的个体手工业者和小商小贩，可以按照他们应纳的所得税额加征一成到五成
  （例如应纳所得税额十元，可以加征一元到五元）。个别获利特多的，可以超过这个限度。
    对于经营手工业、商业等各种合作组织，少数收入特多的，也可以按照他们应纳的所得税额，适当加成征收。
    2、对于残存的资本主义工商业者和行商，可以按照他们应纳的所得税或者临时商业税税额加征一成到十成。个别获利特多的，可以超过这个限度。
    三、在农业税方面，省、自治区、直辖市应当根据中华人民共和国农业税条例并且结合实际情况，对于所属各个地区之间的负担，种植粮食作物和种植经济作物之间的负担，农业生产合作社和个体农民之间的负担，作必要的调整。
    四、在盐税方面，允许省、自治区、直辖市在原有征税办法的基础上，根据实际情况，对盐税税额作必要的调整，并且报国务院备案。
    五、省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会为了调节生产者的收入，平衡负担，开辟财源，或者为了有计划地安排生产，限制盲目的生产经营，在必要的时候，还可以把当地某些利润较大的土特产品和副业产品（包括集体经济的产品和个体经济的产品），列入货物税的征收范围，作为一个新增的税目，征收货物税；或者另外制定税收办法，开征地区性的税收。增列土特产品和副业产品货物税的税目，或者制定土特产品和副业产品的税收办法，应当报告国务院备案。
    六、对于自治区在税收管理上应当给予更大的机动权限。自治区人民委员会如果认为全国统一的税法与本自治区的实际情况不相适应，可以制定本自治区的税收办法，并且报国务院备案。
    七、省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会，根据发展生产、繁荣经济和增加国家积累的原则，对于工商税的征收环节和起征点的规定，凡是认为确实不合理和不利于生产的，都可以机动处理，并且在处理之后报告财政部备案。
    八、省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在执行本规定的时候，应当注意以下各点：
    （一）采取减税、免税的措施，应当既照顾发展生产的需要，又照顾国家资金的积累。
    （二）采取调整税率或者增加税收的措施，应当注意不要影响生产的正常发展和物价的稳定。
    （三）各地在税收上所采取的措施，凡是同邻近地区有密切关系的，应当事先共同协商，取得相互的配合。
    （四）各地在税收上所采取的措施，对统一计划和全国平衡有较大影响的，或者涉及外交关系的，应当报经国务院批准。
