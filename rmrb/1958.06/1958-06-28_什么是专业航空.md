    What is professional aviation?
    Professional aviation has many types, which can be roughly divided into four categories according to the nature of the work: aerial chemical operations, aerial surveying, forestry aviation, and fishery aviation; in addition, there is service-oriented health aviation.
    Aerial chemical operations are aerial spraying operations. At present, the aircraft used for aerial chemical operations in our country is the An-2 aircraft, which is equipped with a powder sprayer or sprayer. It can spray powdered or mist-like chemical agents at a low altitude of five to twenty meters above the ground. It can be used in a short time to control crop diseases and insect pests, remove weeds, and carry out foliar topdressing on a large area. When harvesting cotton, chemical agents can also be sprayed from the air to make the cotton leaves fall off automatically for mechanical harvesting. In humid areas, desiccants can be sprayed from the air to absorb moisture and make crops mature earlier.
    Using airplanes to control insects, remove weeds, topdress, and assist in harvesting crops has the following significant advantages: 1. High efficiency and no delay in farming. 2. Good quality, the distribution of the agents is very uniform, and the efficacy can reach more than 90%. 3. Cost-effective, the amount of medicine used is one-third to one-half less than ground spraying, and the flight cost is also lower than the ground operation cost. 4. It will not damage crops.
    Aerial surveying includes aerial photography and geological surveying. The method of aerial photography is to install an automatic camera with good photosensitive analysis performance on the aircraft, and perform vertical photography of the ground in sections along the survey line. After the film is developed and assembled, a very accurate topographic map can be made. Aerial photography can also meet the special needs of various economic departments, using photos to determine the relevant geological structure, plant ecology, hydrological conditions, timber accumulation, river channel changes, soil erosion and other conditions, which are widely used. Very practical value.
    Geological surveying is the use of aircraft for physical prospecting, gravity measurement, aerial visual inspection and other work. An extremely sensitive detection instrument is installed on the aircraft, which can automatically record underground mineral resources. This can not only greatly reduce the ground labor of geological staff, but also provide a large amount of geological data in a short period of time.
    Forestry aviation is widely used in the forest industry, and there are many types of operations. Airplanes can be used to conduct a general survey of national forest resources and draw forest maps. Regular patrols can also be carried out over large areas of forests to detect forest fires in time, accurately determine the location of forest fires, and immediately notify the forest protection station and nearby residents to put out the fire (if necessary, airplanes can also be used to airdrop fire-fighting teams). When fighting fires, airplanes can also be used for command, airdrops and other tasks.
    In terms of medical and health care, airplanes also have a great role. In mountainous areas or grasslands with inconvenient transportation, if someone gets sick urgently, as long as a telegram is sent, the airplane can send the doctor there in one or two hours, or take the patient to the hospital. In areas where serious infectious diseases have occurred and land and water transportation is cut off, airplanes have become the most ideal means of transportation. Medicines and supplies can be airdropped from airplanes, and medical personnel can be transported to the airport to avoid contact with residents in the epidemic area.
    In fisheries, using airplanes to detect the location and movement of fish schools and investigate the number of fish schools can provide accurate information, allowing fishermen to follow the traces and go straight to the fish caves, returning fully loaded. In case of an accident at sea, the aircraft can immediately go to the rescue.
    In terms of meteorological work, airplanes can also be used to detect meteorological conditions at high altitudes to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. In scientific research, professional airplanes are also a good auxiliary tool. With the development of science and technology, the service scope of professional aviation will be expanded day by day.

    什么是专业航空
    专业航空的种类很多，按工作性质大致可以分为航空化学工作、航空测量、林业航空、渔业航空四类；此外还有服务性的卫生航空。
    航空化学工作是空中喷撒作业，我国目前用在航空化学工作方面的飞机是安二型飞机，上面装有喷粉器或者喷雾器，能够在离地面五公尺到二十公尺的低空喷撒粉状或者雾状的化学药剂，在短时间内为大面积的农作物除治病虫害，清除杂草，进行根外追肥。在收摘棉花的时候，还可以用飞机喷撒化学药剂使棉叶自动脱落，以便使用机械收摘。在土壤潮湿的地区，可用飞机喷撒干燥剂吸除水分，使农作物提早成熟。
    用飞机为农作物除虫、除草、追肥、助收有下面几个显著的优点：1、效率高，不误农时。2、质量好，药剂的分布很均匀，药效可达到90％以上。3、费用省，用药量比地面喷撒节省三分之一到二分之一，飞行费用也比地面作业费用低廉。4、不会损坏农作物。
    航空测量工作包括航空摄影和地质勘测。航空摄影的方法是把感光分析性能很好的自动摄影机装在飞机上，沿着测线对地面分段进行垂直摄影，把底片冲洗以后镶辑起来，便能制成一幅十分精确的地形图。航空摄影还可以满足各个经济部门的特殊需要，利用照片判断出有关地质构造、植物生态、水文状况、木材蓄积、河道变迁、水土冲刷等情况，用途非常广泛。实用价值很高。
    地质勘测就是利用飞机进行物理探矿、重力测量、航空目测等工作。在飞机上装一具感应非常灵敏的探测仪器，可以把地下蕴藏的矿源自动地记录下来。这样不但能够大大地减轻地质工作人员的地面劳动，而且能够在短时间内提供大量的地质资料。
    林业航空在森林工业方面应用很广，作业种类很多。可以用飞机对全国森林资源进行普查，绘制森林图。还可以在大面积的森林上空进行定期巡逻，以便及时发现森林火灾，准确地判定林火的位置，并立即通知护林站和附近居民进行扑救（必要时还可以用飞机空投灭火队）。在救火时，飞机还可以担任指挥、空投等工作。
    在医疗卫生方面，飞机也有很大的作用。在交通不便的山区或者草原上，如果有人得了急病，只要发一个电报，飞机就可以在一、两个小时内把医生送到那里，或者把病人接到医院里去。在发生了严重传染病的地区，水陆交通断绝，这时飞机又成了最理想的运输工具。可以从飞机上空投药品和应用物资，运送医务人员到机场，都可以避免和疫区的居民接触。
    在渔业上用飞机侦察鱼群的位置和动向，调查鱼群的数量，可以提供准确的情报，使渔民按迹循踪直捣鱼穴，满载而归。万一渔船遭到意外，飞机可以马上前去营救。
    在气象工作方面，还可以用飞机在高空探测气象情况，以提高天气预报的准确性。在科学研究方面，专业飞机也是一种很好的辅助工具。随着科学技术的发展，专业航空的服务范围将日益扩大。
