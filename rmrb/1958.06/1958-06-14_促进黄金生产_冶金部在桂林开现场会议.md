Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, June 13th: Liberate thinking, rely on the entire Party and all the people to mine gold, and gold production can make a great leap forward. This is the experience summarized at the national gold production on-site exchange meeting recently held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Guilin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Experience shows that wherever the mass line is implemented, the mystique of technology is broken, leadership is strengthened, overall planning is carried out, resources are mobilized quickly, and widespread development is promoted, gold production can develop rapidly, with less investment, greater returns, higher output, and lower costs. Shandong Province, where gold production had almost stopped before July last year, has aroused enthusiasm for gold mining by criticizing the superstition that gold mines cannot be mined without experts. To date, the number of counties mining gold in the province has increased from the original one to thirty-four. Since the implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, people of all ethnic groups in the region have launched a wave of reporting and prospecting for mines. At present, thirty-two counties in the entire autonomous region have restored and started gold production.

In the development of gold production, mines in many regions have adopted methods of making do with whatever is available, using local materials, and progressing from low-level to high-level to overcome equipment difficulties.

This on-site exchange meeting was held from the 7th to the 11th. Representatives from sixteen provinces and autonomous regions, including Shandong, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, and Guangxi, participated in the meeting.

    促进黄金生产
    冶金部在桂林开现场会议
    新华社桂林13日电  解放思想，依靠全党全民开采金矿，黄金生产就能大跃进。这是冶金工业部最近在广西僮族自治区桂林市召开的全国黄金生产现场交流会上总结的经验。
    经验表明：凡是贯彻执行群众路线，打破技术神秘观点，加强领导，全面规划，轻装上马，遍地开花的地方，黄金生产就能发展快，投资少、收效大、产量高、成本低。去年7月以前黄金生产几乎停止的山东省，由于批判没有专家不能开采金矿的迷信，鼓起了开采黄金的积极性。到目前止，全省开采金矿的县份由原来的一个发展到三十四个。广西僮族自治区自贯彻全党全民办工业的方针以后，全区各族人民掀起了报矿探矿的热潮。目前全自治区已经有三十二个县恢复和开始了黄金生产。
    在发展黄金生产中，许多地区的矿场采取因陋就简，就地取材，从低级到高级的办法来克服设备困难。
    这次现场交流会议是从7日到11日召开的，参加会议的有山东、河北、黑龙江、四川、广西等十六个省、自治区的代表。
