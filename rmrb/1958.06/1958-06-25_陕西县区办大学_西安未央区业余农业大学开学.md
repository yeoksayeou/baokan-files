Shaanxi Counties and Districts Run Universities
Xi'an Weiyang District Amateur Agricultural University Opens

    (Our report) The amateur agricultural university established in Weiyang District, Xi'an City, officially opened on June 2nd. Prior to this, the Jiangzhang Township in Fufeng County, Shaanxi Province, also established an amateur Satellite Farmland Water Conservancy College. Yanta, Beilin, and other districts of Xi'an City also plan to establish several amateur agricultural universities and normal universities soon. These schools admit district and township cadres, students in rural areas, and agricultural cooperative members with a considerable high school education level to participate in studies.
    The students of these institutions all produce, work, and study simultaneously. The one hundred and thirty students participating in the Xi'an Weiyang District Amateur Agricultural University are mostly district-level cadres such as district party secretaries and district heads with a considerable high school education level, with general work experience of five years or more. Some are also veteran cadres who participated in the revolution for ten or twenty years. In the first year, they will study four courses including politics, crop cultivation, and agricultural chemistry. In three years, they will complete ten courses related to agricultural science and technology, reaching the graduation level of a higher vocational school. The one hundred and sixty-plus students of the Satellite Farmland Water Conservancy College generally have an education level of at least elementary school completion and possess certain production knowledge.
    In the great leap forward of agricultural production, the Chinese Communist Party organizations in these regions broke through the mystified notions about running universities, abandoned worries about districts not being able to run them, fears of not having teachers, and concerns about affecting work, etc. They relied on nearby universities and colleges, hired teachers from these universities and colleges, technical cadres from the Agricultural Department, etc., to teach part-time, and cadres from the district agricultural technology extension station to serve as counselors. The Party Secretary takes charge of the political classes. They also plan to invite famous national agricultural labor model Wang Baojing and Xi'an advanced producer and production expert Wu Zhiliang to the school to lecture. In terms of teaching content, they focus on local customs, crops, and production problems, and absorb foreign experience and the actual working conditions of the district for teaching. They also adopt the method of learning and applying simultaneously, treating experimental fields as laboratories and agricultural cooperatives as practice farms.

    陕西县区办大学
    西安未央区业余农业大学开学
    本报讯　西安市未央区成立的业余农业大学，在6月2日正式开学。在此以前，陕西省扶风县绛帐镇还成立了一所业余卫星农田水利学院。西安市雁塔、碑林等区也计划最近办起几所业余农业大学和师范大学。这些学校吸收具有相当高中文化程度的区乡干部、在乡学生和农业社社员参加学习。
    这些院校的学生，都是边生产，边工作，边学习。参加西安市未央区业余农业大学的一百三十名学员，多是具有相当高中文化程度的区委书记、区长等区级干部，工作年限一般都在五年以上，还有一部分是参加革命一、二十年的老干部。第一年学政治、作物栽培、农业化学等四门课，三年学完十门有关农业科学技术课程，达到高等专科学校毕业程度。卫星农田水利学院一百六十多名学员的文化程度一般都在完小以上，并具备一定的生产知识。
    在农业生产大跃进中，这些地区的中共党组织打破了对办大学的神秘观念，抛弃了怕区上办不了、怕没有教师、怕影响工作等等顾虑，依靠附近的高等院校，聘请这些大专学校的教师、农业厅技术干部等来校兼课，区农业技术推广站的干部作辅导员。政治课请党委书记担任。他们还计划请著名的全国农业劳动模范王保京和西安市先进生产者、生产能手吴志良等到校讲课。在教学内容上，都以当地的风土、作物和生产中的问题为主，并且吸收外地经验和本区实际工作情况进行教学。还采用边学边用的方法，把试验田当作实验室，农业社当作实习农场。
