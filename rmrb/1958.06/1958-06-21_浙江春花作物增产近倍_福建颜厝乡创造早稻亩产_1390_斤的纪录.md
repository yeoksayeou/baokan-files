Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th - Zhejiang Province's 10.5 million mu of spring flowering crops, including wheat, barley, and broad beans, have all been harvested, with a total yield of 2.392 billion jin, nearly double that of last year.

The average yield per mu of wheat in twenty-two counties throughout the province has increased by more than double compared to last year, and the average yield per mu of wheat in twenty-six counties is over 200 jin. Ruian County achieved the highest yield at 342 jin, more than two and a half times more than last year. In Lishui County, the Lixing Cooperative achieved an average yield of 1,400 jin per mu on 3.9 mu of wheat. The Aiguo Cooperative in Ruian County achieved a yield of 1,020 jin per mu on 32 mu of wheat. Even the island counties of Dinghai, Putuo, and Daishan, which were once considered to have barren land, heavy rainfall, low temperatures, and poor natural conditions, have seen their wheat yields jump to over 220 jin per mu this year. Pingyang and Longyou counties, which were still listed as laggards last winter, have also made great leaps in the production of spring flowering crops. The wheat yield in Pingyang County has jumped to 280 jin per mu this year, an increase of 188% compared to last year's 97 jin per mu. The wheat yield in Qu County this year is 188 jin per mu, also more than double that of last year.

The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee made cultivating spring flowering crops an important part of organizing the high tide of agricultural production last winter and this spring. In December of last year, the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Department of Agriculture promptly held an on-site meeting on spring flowering crops, organizing representatives from forty-eight counties and cities to visit Shaoxing County for on-site observation, further boosting their enthusiasm for fighting the first battle of the Great Leap Forward, and launching a province-wide upsurge in guaranteeing full seedlings, opening drainage ditches, and topdressing fertilizer. In April of this year, the first major inspection of agricultural production organized by the Provincial Party Committee also included the cultivation of spring flowering crops as one of the inspection items. Through this inspection, the masses were encouraged to strengthen the final cultivation work before harvesting. During this period, the Party committees at all levels also organized cadres and commune members to debate and overcome the idea that the production of spring flowering crops was already "set," laying the ideological foundation for striving for a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangzhou, 20th - Zeng Qingxi, head of Yan厝 Township in Longxi County, Fujian Province, has created a record of 1,390 jin and two liang per mu on a 1.22 mu experimental field of early rice. On the 17th, this experimental field was harvested by production team leaders, experienced farmers, and cadres from the Longxi County Agricultural Bureau, etc., individually threshed and sun-dried. On the 18th, the weighing results showed a total output of 1,696 jin.

The soil of this experimental field is the worst in Yan厝 Township, with an early rice yield of only 530 jin per mu last year. However, Zeng Qingxi boldly implemented technological innovations in this experimental field, turning low yield into high yield. His main measures were: increasing the number of fumigations from once to twice to increase ground temperature and promote the growth of early rice; deep plowing the land by seven inches and covering it with two inches of river mud to improve soil quality, and applying more than 900 dan of base fertilizer per mu; completely replacing the land with the Luchai No. 1 improved variety, transplanting seedlings fifteen days earlier than in previous years, and shortening the row spacing compared to the past; timely cultivation, baking the fields, and reasonable topdressing and irrigation. As a result, the number of effective panicles per mu reached more than 400,000.

    浙江春花作物增产近倍
    福建颜厝乡创造早稻亩产1390斤的纪录
    据新华社杭州20日电　浙江省一千零五十万亩小麦、大麦、蚕豆等春花作物全部收割完毕，总产量达到二十三亿九千二百万斤，比去年增产近一倍。
    全省有二十二个县的小麦平均亩产量比去年增加一倍以上，有二十六个县的小麦平均亩产量都在二百斤以上。最高的瑞安县达到三百四十二斤，比去年增加两倍半还多。丽水县丽兴社有三亩九分小麦，平均亩产一千四百斤。瑞安县爱国社三十二亩小麦，亩产一千零二十斤。一向被认为土地贫瘠、多雨低温、自然条件较差的定海、普陀、岱山等海岛县，今年小麦的亩产量都跃进到二百二十斤以上。去冬还被列为后进的平阳、龙游等县，春花作物产量也有了很大跃进。平阳县今年小麦亩产量一跃而达到二百八十斤，比去年每亩九十七斤增产188％。衢县今年小麦亩产一百八十八斤，也比去年增产一倍以上。
    中共浙江省委在去冬今春把培育春花作物作为组织农业生产高潮的一个重要内容。去年12月，省委农村工作部和省农业厅及时举行春花作物现场会议，组织四十八个县、市的代表到绍兴县实地参观，进一步鼓起了打好大跃进第一炮的劲头，在全省范围内开展了保证全苗、开沟排水、培土施肥的增产热潮。今年4月，省委组织的农业生产第一次大检查，又把培育春花作物列为检查项目之一。通过这次检查，鼓舞群众加强了收割前的最后培育工作。在此期间，各地党委又组织干部和社员辩论，克服了春花作物生产已经“定局”的思想，为争取丰收打下了思想基础。
    新华社漳州20日电　福建省龙溪县颜厝乡乡长曾清溪种植的一亩二分二厘早稻试验田，创造了亩产一千三百九十斤零二两的纪录。17日，这块试验田由各生产队长、老农和龙溪县农业局干部等参加收割，单打单晒，在18日过秤的结果，总产达到一千六百九十六斤。
    这块试验田的土质是颜厝乡最差的一块，去年早稻亩产只有五百三十斤。但是，曾清溪在这块试验田中大胆实行技术革新，使低产变成了高产。他的主要措施是：熏田由过去一次增加到两次，增高地温，促进早稻生长；土地深犁七寸，又复盖了二寸厚的河泥，每亩下基肥九百多担，改善了土质；全部改用陆财号良种，比往年提前十五天插秧，株行距比过去缩短了；适时中耕、烤田和合理追肥、排灌。结果每亩有效穗数达四十万穗以上。
