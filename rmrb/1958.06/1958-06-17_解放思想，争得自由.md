In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, miracles emerged everywhere due to the liberation of people's minds and the boosting of their enthusiasm. As a result, things that could not be done in the past few years or decades were done in a short period of time; things that were once不敢想也不敢做 were accomplished. Today, in the new situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the original spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and do things, this proletarian "unstoppable" great spirit, can be said to be an unprecedented liberation and a manifestation of great freedom.

The freedom mentioned here refers to the relationship between freedom and necessity in materialist dialectics. Freedom is when people understand the objective necessity of the development of things. Chairman Mao said: "No matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of that thing, its nature, its relationship with things outside of it, you don't know the laws of that thing, you don't know how to do it, and you can't do it well." ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War") "Don't know how to do it" means that people are still blind to the thing they want to do, and there is no freedom to speak of; of course, they cannot do it well. But when people gradually grasp the laws of that thing, that is, from "don't know how to do it" to knowing how to do it, they can do that thing well. Thus, blindness is transformed into consciousness, and necessity is transformed into freedom.

However, objective necessity is gradually understood, and freedom is gradually obtained. From the perspective of people's social relations, our socialist world is in the process of leaping from the "kingdom of necessity" to the "kingdom of freedom." From the perspective of people's control over nature, that is, over natural forces, it is always in the process of transforming from necessity to freedom.

However, the liberation of thought we are talking about today is to require people's ideological understanding to conform to the objective reality in which they are located; that is, to require people to be liberated from the position of being dominated by the object they should dominate and transformed into the position of dominator. For the revolutionary reality we are in today, what does the "object that people should dominate" mean here? That is all the realistic possibilities of developing productive forces after we have transformed the relations of production; that is the great subjective initiative and creativity of the liberated people; that is the objective necessity of our socialist revolution. But when people's ideological understanding lags behind objective reality, they cannot recognize this necessity; people's thoughts cannot reflect the advanced demands of the masses, and they cannot see the seeds of new things. In other words, this reality is "in itself" for him, and he is blindly unfree to this reality; engaging in socialist construction, but "does not know how to do it." Such as sticking to conventions in work, being complacent and not making progress, various mysterious views, and the lack of a bold and original spirit are actually manifestations of this blindness and manifestations of unfreedom.

Precisely because this "object" is what we should and can dominate, therefore, once people's minds are liberated, they can consciously use all the possibilities of objective existence to create great miracles in socialist construction. For example, the entire motorization of Hepu Special Zone in Guangdong in eight days; in less than two months, Panyu County trial-produced biogas power generation, non-clinker cement, universal tractors, earthen automobiles, steamships, power pile drivers, and created and imitated more than 100 new types of agricultural implements, and so on. This situation is the result of ideological liberation, that is, the transformation from the position of being dominated by the object that people should originally dominate to the position of the dominator; that is, liberation from blindness to consciousness and from necessity to freedom.

For our situation today, to overcome this phenomenon of ideological lagging behind reality and being divorced from reality, to liberate thought, we must also overcome the shackles of dogmatism, empiricism, and right-leaning conservative thought; they are obstacles to the liberation of thought and fetters to freedom. Dogmatism is not good at learning from foreign experience based on China's specific conditions and is divorced from reality; empiricism sticks to conventions and loses sensitivity to new things. In short, neither reflects the world with materialist dialectics, and therefore cannot obtain a deep understanding and understanding of objective necessity. In this sense, the problem of opposing dogmatism and empiricism is also a problem of striving for freedom.

However, the transformation from necessity to freedom must be completed through practice. For our socialist construction cause, Chairman Mao pointed out: "It must be understood that there are contradictions in this issue, that is, the contradiction between the objective laws of socialist social and economic development and our subjective understanding, which needs to be resolved in practice." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") This means that the objective necessity of socialist economic development must be recognized through practice; and recognizing objective necessity through practice is the opportunity to transform from blindness to consciousness and from necessity to freedom. The party's policies and guidelines are the Marxist summary of practical experience and are based on the understanding of objective laws. In other words, it is the recognition and understanding of objective necessity. Therefore, the more profound and correct people's understanding of the party's guidelines is, the more conscious, freer, and more creative people can be in their work.

As mentioned above, the so-called liberation of thought is to overcome the blindness of people's activities and improve their consciousness, that is, to recognize and understand objective necessity. But from the opposition between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology, the so-called ideological liberation means to be liberated from the influence of bourgeois ideology and to improve socialist consciousness. Therefore, as ideological liberation, it is both a problem of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie" and a problem of transforming from necessity to freedom. The two are unified. In this sense, this struggle to "promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie" is also helping people to understand objective necessity and promoting people's liberation from necessity to freedom. And the most fundamental thing that expresses social necessity is the issue of political direction, and the so-called politics is the commander, which is the reason. Therefore, if people are divorced from politics, they will lose their direction and will be blind on fundamental issues. And the improvement of people's political consciousness is an important step in ideological liberation and gaining freedom.

People who are ruled by bourgeois ideology have no freedom. For example, some writers cannot write works and feel "unfree in creation"; and the so-called "unfree in creation" is just that under the shackles of bourgeois ideology, the author does not understand or rarely understands the object that the work should reflect, and feels that it is unfree to create for socialist society. Therefore, if you want to strive for freedom and be able to create freely, you must break the bourgeoisie and establish the proletariat, liberate your mind, and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers; to transform from "in itself" to "for itself" and from necessity to freedom. Being able to create freely, you can write works.

There are also those who have serious bourgeois individualism and are extremely unfree people. Such people are dominated by egoism and enslaved by the surrounding things; in the face of the social necessity that he should recognize and should dominate, he is nothing more than a slave. Therefore, overcoming individualistic thought is also a great liberation. If a person cannot overcome the enslavement of individualism, there is no freedom to speak of.

After the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist movement, and the double-anti movement, the people of the whole country distinguished the line between the enemy and ourselves, criticized bourgeois ideology, and also criticized conservative ideology; thus, a great liberation of thought appeared, and the enthusiasm for consciously building socialism erupted like a thousand troops and horses, like an atomic rupture. And this new atmosphere of the nationwide Great Leap Forward is precisely the manifestation of the freedom of mastering one's own destiny.

In short, freedom is the understanding of objective necessity, but people's understanding of objective necessity must be obtained in the practice of class struggle and production struggle. And in the final analysis, it is the relationship between people's understanding and practice, that is, how people correctly reflect reality based on practice, thus guiding people's understanding of practical activities.

    解放思想，争得自由
    吴传启
    在反浪费反保守运动过程中，到处出现了由于人们思想上的解放，鼓起了干劲，创造出奇迹。于是在短时期内，做了过去几年或几十年所做不了的事情；做到了过去不敢做也不敢想的事情。今天在全民大跃进的新形势下，所表现出来的这种敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的独创精神，这种无产阶级的“势如破竹”的伟大气魄；可以说是一种空前的大解放，也是伟大的自由的表现。
    这里所说的自由，是对唯物主义辩证法关于自由和必然的关系而言的。自由就是人们认识了事物发展的客观的必然性。毛主席说过：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）“不知道如何去做”，就是人对于他所要做的那件事还是盲目的，还谈不上什么自由；当然也就不能把它做好。可是当人们逐渐摸到了那件事情的规律，即从“不知道如何去做”，进到了知道怎样去做的时候，就能把那件事情做好。于是盲目性就转化为自觉，必然性就转化为自由了。
    然而，客观必然性是逐步了解的，自由是逐步获得的。从人对于自己的社会关系来说，在我们社会主义世界里，正处在从“必然的王国”向“自由的王国”飞跃的过程中。从人对于自然界，即对于自然力的控制来说，则永远处在从必然向自由的转化过程中。
    但是，我们今天所说的解放思想，乃是要求人们的思想认识符合于它所处的客观实际；即要求人们从被他所应当支配的对象支配着的地位解放出来，转化为支配者的地位。对于我们今天所处的革命实际来说，这里所说人们“应当支配的对象”意味着什么呢？那就是我们变革了生产关系以后，发展生产力的一切现实可能性；那就是解放了的人民群众的伟大的主观能动性和创造性；就是我们社会主义革命的客观必然性。可是当人们的思想认识落后于客观实际的时候，就认识不到这种必然性；人们的思想就不能反映群众的先进要求，看不见新生事物的萌芽。也就是说，这种实际对于他是“自在”的，他对于这种实际是盲目的不自由的；从事社会主义建设，却“不知道如何去做”。如像在工作上的墨守成规，故步自封，各种神秘观点，以及缺乏大胆独创精神的种种现象，实际上就是这种盲目性的表现，就是不自由的表现。
    正因为这种“对象”是为我们所应该所能够支配的，因此当人们的思想一经解放以后，就能自觉地运用客观存在的一切可能性，在社会主义建设中创造出伟大的奇迹来。比如广东合浦专区八天内全部车子化；番禺县不到两个月，试制成了沼气发电、无熟料水泥、万能拖拉机、土汽车、汽船、动力打桩机及创造仿造了一百多种新式农具，等等。这种情形，就是思想解放的结果，就是从原来被人们所应该支配的对象所支配着的地位向支配者地位的转化；也就是从盲目到自觉，从必然到自由的解放。
    对于我们今天的情形来说，要克服这种思想落后于实际和脱离实际的现象，要解放思想，还要克服教条主义、经验主义和右倾保守思想的束缚；它们是解放思想的阻碍，是自由的桎梏。教条主义不善于根据我国具体情况来学习外国经验，脱离实际；经验主义死守成规，对新事物丧失敏感。总之都不是以唯物主义辩证法来反映世界，因此就不能获得对于客观必然性的深刻认识和了解。从这个意义上说，反对教条主义和经验主义的问题，也就是争取自由的问题。
    但从必然到自由的转化，必须通过实践来完成。对于我们的社会主义建设事业来说，毛主席指出：“必须懂得，在这个问题上是存在着矛盾的，即社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾，这需要在实践中去解决。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）这就是说，社会主义经济发展的客观必然性，必须通过实践来认识；而通过实践来认识客观必然性，就是从盲目转化为自觉、从必然转化为自由的契机。我们党的方针政策，就是对于实践经验的马克思主义的总结，是以对于客观规律的认识为基础的。也就是说，它是对于客观必然性的认识和了解。所以当人们对于党的方针的理解愈深刻、愈正确，人们在工作中才能更加自觉、更加自由和更加有创造性。
    如上所述，所谓解放思想，就是要克服人们活动的盲目性和提高自觉性，就是要认识和了解客观必然性。但从资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想的对立来说，所谓思想解放，是意味着要从资产阶级思想影响下解放出来，提高社会主义的觉悟。因此作为解放思想，既是“兴无灭资”的问题，又是从必然转化为自由的问题。二者是统一的。从这个意义上说，这一场“兴无灭资”的斗争，也就是帮助人们对客观必然性的了解，促进人们从必然向自由的解放。而表现社会必然性的最根本的东西，就是政治方向问题，所谓政治是统帅也就是这个道理。因此如果人们脱离政治，就要迷失方向，就会在根本问题上是盲目的。而人们政治觉悟的提高，就是思想解放，就是获得自由的一个重要步骤。
    受资产阶级思想统治的人们，是没有自由的。例如，有的作家写不出作品，感到“创作不自由”；而所谓“创作不自由”，不过是他在资产阶级思想的束缚下，作者对于作品所应该反映的对象不了解或很少了解，感到为社会主义社会进行创作是不自由的罢了。因此如要争得自由，要能自由地创作，就必须破资立无，解放思想，向工农兵学习；才能从“自在”转化为“自为”，从必然转化为自由。能够自由地创作，就能写出作品了。
    还有那些资产阶级个人主义思想严重的人们，也是极不自由的人。这种人受利己主义的支配，受周围事物的奴役；他在其所应该认识、所应该支配的社会必然性面前，不过是奴隶。所以克服个人主义思想，也是一种大解放。如果一个人不能克服个人主义的奴役，就谈不上什么自由。
    全国人民，经过整风、反右派和双反运动以后，分清了敌我界线，批判了资产阶级思想，也批判了保守思想；从而出现了思想上的大解放，于是自觉地建设社会主义的干劲，就有如千军万马之势，像原子破裂一样地爆发出来了。而这种全民大跃进的新气象，就正是自己掌握了自己命运的自由的表现。
    总之，自由是对于客观必然性的了解，但人们对于客观必然性的认识，则必须在阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中获得。而归根结底，则是人们的认识和实践的关系问题，是人们如何根据实践正确地反映实际、从而指导着人们实践活动的认识问题。
