　　The Strike Struggle of London Auto Workers
　　Li Yichuan
　　Fifty-three thousand London auto workers have now entered the fifth week of their strike. From the start of the strike on May 5th until now, not a single bus has run on the two thousand square miles of streets crisscrossing the suburbs of London. The striking workers are united like a rock. They are waging a heroic struggle against the reduction of their living standards and for the right to survival.

　　The “Great Leap Forward” of Living Costs
　　This strike has been caused by the British government's policy of freezing wages and reducing the living standards of the working people, and it is also a direct conflict between British "nationalized" enterprises and workers. From last winter to this spring, Britain's financial economy has been in an unstable state. Inflation, rising prices, and the upward surge of the cost of living index have greatly deteriorated the living conditions of the working people.

　　Even according to the official cost of living index, it was 103% in January 1957, and by October 1957, it had leapt to 108%. This year, raw material prices have fallen by about 14%, but the cost of living index has leaped upward by another two points in May alone. If calculated from before the war, the increase in workers' wages has lagged even further behind the rise in the cost of living. According to bulletins published by the University of London and Cambridge University, from 1939 to 1957, the cost of living index rose by 170%, while during the same period, the wages of bus drivers only increased by 115%.

　　But this is far from expressing the relative and absolute impoverishment of the workers' lives. Official and semi-official figures are questionable. From the results of my conversations with many workers, I understand that the cost of living has risen at least four or five times compared to before the war. For example:

　　Item　　Price　　Before the War　　Now
　　Shirt 1　　7 shillings 6 pence　　35 shillings
　　Suit 1　　60 shillings 10 pence　　220 shillings 10 pence
　　Flour 1 lb　　4 pence　　11 pence
　　Sugar 1 lb　　1.25 pence　　8 pence
　　Note: 1 pound = 20 shillings 1 shilling = 12 pence

　　Due to the deteriorating living conditions, workers' strike struggles have been emerging one after another in recent years. After the resolution of last year's strike struggles, a wave of seven million workers demanding wage increases and improved working conditions has formed again this spring. Among them are dockworkers, coal miners, and mechanical shipbuilding workers. London auto workers are at the forefront of this struggle.

　　“Killing the Chicken to Scare the Monkeys”

　　In view of this situation, the British government has adopted various means to try to defeat the workers' struggles one by one. They believe that auto workers are the weakest link, isolate them, and carry out a full-scale crackdown in order to "kill the chicken to scare the monkeys." In this way, the London Transport Company and the London auto workers have reached a showdown. After the London auto workers proposed a wage increase of ten shillings, after numerous negotiations, the London Transport Company only agreed to increase the wages of some auto workers by eight shillings, while refusing the wage increase demands of others. At the same time as negotiating wage increases with the London auto workers, there were also powerful railway workers demanding wage increases. If the railway workers went on strike, it would seriously affect the entire British economy. The British government partially agreed to the railway workers' demands, thus isolating the auto workers. The British government chose auto workers as the target of attack because this enterprise has little impact on the British economy. If the strike drags on for a long time, it may also arouse "public" "dissatisfaction" with the auto workers. The "Manchester Guardian" did not say without reason: "The government seems to have deliberately provoked this war."

　　“Tighten Our Belts and Fight to the End”

　　But the workers' fighting spirit is even higher. The strike has been going on for five weeks, with as many as eight thousand four hundred buses on strike. Although the government has exhausted all means, it has not been able to gather enough people to drive even one bus. The workers' fighting mood is so high that even many union leaders are surprised!

　　During the strike, especially in persisting in such a long strike, there are many difficulties for many workers. But the workers have overcome these difficulties and persisted in the struggle. One driver from the Green Lanes parking lot, named O'Shaw, is forty years old this year. He has a wife and three children, the oldest is fifteen years old and the youngest is only ten years old. In the past, when he didn't strike, he relied on overtime to support his whole family, and even then there were many difficulties. Now that he is on strike, he only receives four pounds and ten shillings from the union's strike fund each week. He still has to pay rent of one pound and twelve shillings, otherwise the landlord will kick him out. This one item alone takes up one-third of his allowance. In the past, he "bought" things on installment plans, but now he can no longer continue to pay. If he continues to delay, he may be sued in court. Now he has no money to buy cigarettes, and even the food he eats must be greatly reduced.

　　Another worker, named Walmier, is a driver with two children, and his wife is bedridden after an operation. During the strike, receiving the union's allowance of four pounds and ten shillings, the rent alone is two pounds and eleven shillings, taking up more than half, and other aspects are even more difficult.

　　Although many workers are in different situations, they are experiencing the same fate. However, they said, "Although this is hard, it is worth it. We will tighten our belts and fight to the end."

　　The discipline of the striking workers is very impressive. The actions of more than 50,000 people are like one person. In the offices of the strike committees in many parking lots (often set up in bars or some unused clubs), there are notices and discipline for the strike period. For example, the following discipline is in place at the Mead Road parking lot: What should be done: 1. Always carry your union card, 2. Read the notices regularly, 3. Perform picket duties conscientiously. What should not be done: 1. Do not fight with people who provoke you, 2. Do not casually make statements to the press or reporters (because bourgeois journalists often distort facts), 3. Do not bring alcohol to the office.

　　During the strike, the striking workers also took very good care of some citizens who were indeed in difficulty. In the first day or two of the strike, the auto workers registered the names and addresses of disabled people who ride the bus, and during the strike, the workers used their own cars to pick up and drop off these unfortunate people on a regular basis.

　　“The Auto Workers' Today is Our Tomorrow”

　　The auto workers' strike has received widespread support and sympathy from the working class, who believe that "the auto workers' today is our tomorrow." If the auto workers fall, they will also suffer. Thousands of pounds have been remitted to the strike headquarters to express sympathy and support. The ordinary citizens of London also stand on the side of the auto workers. Even many police officers have personally told the striking workers: "We hope you succeed!" Because some police officers are also asking for wage increases.

　　This support of the working class has begun to develop into sympathy strikes. Bus workers near the London area have begun to do so. Dockworkers, oil transporters, and transportation power workers have also held strikes or demanded strikes. After this news came out, the government immediately transferred six thousand logistics troops to replace the strikers in order to break the strike. The situation is still developing.

　　The London auto workers' strike has also received the sympathy of the world working class and people. They have received hundreds of telegrams. These telegrams came from Prague, Berlin, Paris, New Zealand, Beijing and other corners of the world, expressing the same sentiment: "We wish you success."

### 伦敦汽车工人的罢工斗争

　　伦敦汽车工人的罢工斗争
　　李一川
    五万三千伦敦汽车工人现在进入了罢工的第五个星期。从5月5日罢工开始到现在，在整个伦敦城郊纵横两千平方英里的街道网上，没有一辆公共汽车。罢工工人团结的像岩石一般。他们为了反对降低生活水平、争取生存权利进行着英勇的斗争。
    生活费用的“跃进”
    这一次的罢工，是英国政府一直在执行的冻结工资、降低劳动人民的生活水平的政策所引起的，也是英国“国有化”企业同工人的直接冲突。从去年冬到今年春，英国的财政经济处于一种不稳定的状态中，通货膨胀、物价腾贵、生活费用指数向上直升，这就使劳动人民的生活状况大大地恶化了。
    即使根据官方的生活费用指数来说，1957年1月份是103％，到1957年10月份时，已一跃而上升到108％。今年原料价格下跌了14％左右，然而生活费用指数仅在5月份又向上跃进了两点。如果从战前算起的话，工人工资的增加更落后于生活费用的上涨了。据伦敦大学和剑桥大学发表的公报显示，1939到1957年，生活费用指数上涨了170％，而在同时期中，汽车司机的工资只增加了115％。
    但是这远不能表现出工人生活相对地和绝对地贫困化。官方和半官方的数字是值得怀疑的。我从和许多工人谈话中了解的结果表明生活费用比战前至少上涨了四、五倍。例如：
　　项目  价格　　战前　　现在
　　衬衣1件    7先令6便士    35先令
　　西装1套    60先令10便士    220先令10便士
　　面粉1磅　　4便士　　11便士
　　糖1磅　　1.25便士　　8便士
　　注：1英镑＝20先令　1先令＝12便士
    由于生活条件日趋恶化，近年来工人罢工斗争此起彼伏，去年罢工斗争解决之后，今年春季又形成了七百万工人要求增加工资、改善工作条件的风潮。其中有码头工人、煤矿工人、机械造船工人等。伦敦汽车工人处于这个斗争的最前线。
    “杀鸡给猴看”
    鉴于这种局势，英国政府便采取了各种手段企图对工人的斗争各个击破。他们认为汽车工人是最弱的一环，加以孤立，并进行了全力的打击，以便“杀鸡给猴看”。这样，伦敦运输公司就和伦敦汽车工人形成了摊牌局面。当伦敦汽车工人提出增加工资十先令之后，经过无数次的谈判，伦敦运输公司只答应给汽车工人一部分人增加八先令，而拒绝了另一部分人的增加工资要求。在和伦敦汽车工人要求增加工资谈判的同时，还有强大的铁路工人要求增加工资。如果铁路工人罢工的话，就会使英国整个经济受到严重的打击。英国政府部分地答应了铁路工人的要求，这样就孤立了汽车工人。英国政府所以选择了汽车工人作为打击对象，还因为这个企业对英国经济没有什么影响，如果罢工长期拖下去的话，还可以引起“公众”对汽车工人的“不满”。“曼彻斯特卫报”并不是不无原因地说：“政府似乎故意挑起了这场战争”。
    “勒紧裤带也要斗争到底”
    但是工人的斗志更高了。罢工已经五个星期了，罢工的汽车有八千四百辆之多，政府虽用尽各种手段，还没有能够凑够开出一辆汽车的人数。工人的斗争情绪是这样高昂，甚至许多工会领袖也感到吃惊！
    在罢工中，特别是坚持这样长时期的罢工，对许多工人来说困难是很多的。但工人们都克服了这些困难，坚持了斗争。绿树林停车场一位司机，名叫欧肖，今年四十岁，家中一个老婆，三个孩子，最大的十五岁，最小的才十岁。过去不罢工时，都是靠加班加点养活全家的，那时困难还很多。现在罢工了，每星期只是从工会的罢工基金中领出四镑十先令。他现在还得付房租一镑十二先令，否则的话，房东就要把他撵出去。只这一项就用去了他的津贴的三分之一。过去用分期付款“买”了下的东西，现在再也不能继续付款了，如果继续拖下去，他就可能被告到法院。现在没钱买烟了，甚至吃的东西也必须大大缩减。
    另外一个工人，名叫华尔米尔，是个司机，有两个小孩，老婆因病开刀卧床了。在罢工期间领工会给的四镑十先令的津贴，只房租一项两镑十一先令，用去一半还要多，其它方面就更要困难了。
    许多工人的处境虽不同，但经受着同样的遭遇。然而他们表示“这虽艰苦，但是值得的，就是勒紧裤带，也要斗争到底”。
    罢工工人的纪律性给人们的印象很深，五万多人的行动就像一个人一样。在许多停车场罢工委员会的办公室里（往往设在酒吧间或者一些不用的俱乐部），张贴着罢工期间的注意事项和纪律。例如在米德路停车场就有如下的纪律：应该作的：一、经常带着你的工会证，二、经常阅读通知，三、认真执行纠察任务。不要作的：一、不要同向你挑衅的人殴斗，二、不要向报界或记者随便发表谈话（因为资产阶级的记者经常歪曲事实），三、不要把酒带到办公室。
    在罢工期间，罢工工人对于确实有困难的一些市民的照顾也是非常周到。在罢工的前一两天，汽车工人把乘坐公共汽车的残废者的姓名地址登记下来，在罢工期间，工人们用自己的汽车定时接送这些不幸者。
    “汽车工人的今天，就是我们的明天”
    汽车工人的罢工得到工人阶级的普遍支持与同情，他们认为“汽车工人的今天，就是我们的明天”，假如汽车工人倒下去了，他们也要遭殃。数以千计的英镑纷纷汇寄到罢工总部，表示同情与支持。整个伦敦的普通市民也站在汽车工人这一边。甚至许多警察都亲自告诉罢工工人说：“我们希望你们成功！”因为一些警察也在要求增加工资。
    工人阶级的这种支持已开始发展成为同情罢工。伦敦区附近的公共汽车工人已开始这样做了。码头工人、运油工人和交通运输动力业工人也举行罢工或要求罢工。这个消息传出之后，政府马上抽调六千名后勤部队，准备代替罢工者，以便破坏罢工。现在的情况还在发展中。
    伦敦汽车工人的罢工还得到了世界工人阶级与人民的同情。他们接到数百份的电报。这些电报来自布拉格、柏林、巴黎、新西兰、北京等世界的各个角落，表达了同一的心意：“祝你们成功”。
