Methods for Converting a Two-Way Plow into a Deep Plow

The method for converting a light double-wheeled two-way plow into a deep plow is as follows:

First, move the front plow completely from the right beam to the left beam, and install the front yoke's upper eye on the left eye of the traction beam; drill a 10 mm small hole on the left beam 300 mm away from the left eye of the traction beam, install the front plow support rod, and change the square-headed bolt at the rear of the adjusting toothed plate to a countersunk bolt so that the front plow is tightly connected to the left beam.

Second, remove the trailing section of the rear plow and replace it with a triangular fish-spine-style plowshare. This plowshare does not have a moldboard. The manufacturing method is as follows: the plow rod is made of flat iron, with a total length of 385 mm, a width of 50 mm, and a thickness of 12 mm. Bend it at a 90-degree angle 185 mm from the rear end of the plow rod to the middle; from the bend, bend it again at a 90-degree angle 95 mm upwards, and drill two holes to install the plow blade. The distance between the holes is 45 mm, which matches the holes of the plow blade. Drill a quarter-inch small hole every 14 mm from the rear end of the plow rod, for a total of twelve holes, for adjusting the depth. The shape of the plow blade is a triangular fish-spine style, with a width of 230 mm and a length of 195 mm. The rear of the plow blade is 6 mm thick, and the tip is 1 mm thick.

Third, use a piece of flat iron 110 mm long, 50 mm wide, and 1 mm thick, and drill two holes according to the distance between the eyes of the plow handle and the plow yoke. Use two square-headed bolts to connect the plow handle and the plow yoke together.

Fourth, turn the square axle of the furrow wheel inward to prevent it from pressing on the tilled ground.

    双铧犁改装深耕犁的办法
    用轻型双轮双铧犁改装为深耕犁的做法是：
    首先，把前犁从右梁全部移到左梁上去，把前辕上眼安在牵引梁上的左眼上；在左梁距牵引梁左眼三百公厘处钻一个十米厘小眼，将前犁支杆安上，并要将调节齿板后部的方头罗栓改为沉头罗栓，以便使前犁与左梁紧连一起。
    再次，将后犁的犁拖部分卸下，换上三角型鱼脊背式的犁头。这个犁头没有犁镜。它的制造方法是：犁杆用扁铁，全长三百八十五公厘，宽五十公厘，厚十二公厘。从犁杆最后端至中间一百八十五公厘处，来一个九十度的弯；从弯处往上到九十五公厘处，再来一个九十度弯，并钻两个眼，以便安犁铧。眼与眼的距离四十五公厘，和犁铧的眼吻合，从犁杆后端起每隔十四公厘钻一个四分小眼，共钻十二个，作调节深浅用。犁铧的形状是三角鱼脊背式的，宽二百三十公厘，长一百九十五公厘，犁铧的后部厚六公厘、尖厚一公厘。
    再次，用一块长一百一十公厘、宽五十公厘、厚一公厘的扁铁，按犁把和犁辕的眼距离大小钻两个眼，用两个方头罗栓，把犁把和犁辕连结在一起。
    再次，要将沟地轮的方轴翻向里，以免压在耕过的地面上。
