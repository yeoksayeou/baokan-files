　　Singing of the Wheat Harvest
　　As soon as the sun comes out, it shines on the hillside,
　　Singing a song of the wheat harvest,
　　In previous years, harvesting wheat required people to carry it,
　　This year, harvesting wheat uses carts to transport it.
　　North and south of the hill are a sea of yellow,
　　Wheat ears sparkle with golden light.
　　The wheat grains are full like pearls,
　　Each wheat ear is half a foot long.
　　As soon as the sun comes out, it shines on the farm,
　　The commune's wheat has reached the threshing ground,
　　Every household rejoices in increased production,
　　White flour steamed buns are sweet and fragrant.

　　歌唱小麦大丰收
    太阳一出照山坡，
    唱个小麦丰收歌，
    往年收麦用人挑，
    今年收麦用车驮。
    岗南岗北一片黄，
    麦穗闪闪放金光。
    麦粒饱满像珍珠，
    刁刁麦穗半尺长。
    太阳一出照农庄，
    社里麦子登了场，
    家家户户喜增产，
    白面馍馍甜又香。
