Learning Advanced Experience from Newspapers
Tengchong County's Various Tasks Advance by Leaps and Bounds

    (Our report) Kunming, Yunnan Province - Tengchong County actively learns advanced experiences published in newspapers from other regions, and integrates them with local conditions, becoming an important method for promoting technological innovation within the county.

    The Tengchong County Committee of the Communist Party of China subscribes to many central and provincial newspapers, and assigns specific personnel to read them, searching for advanced experiences suitable for promotion locally. Once a promising idea is identified, the county committee immediately informs districts, townships, and communes to organize comprehensive learning, while comrades from the county committee conduct experiments. After success, meetings are convened to organize visits and internships for immediate promotion. During the fertilizer accumulation campaign, Comrade Kong Fanyao, the County Party Secretary, saw various advanced methods in the Yunnan Daily, such as creating granular fertilizer, artificial cattle manure, night soil, and high-temperature rapid composting. He went to Xiaoxi Township to experiment, accumulating 140,000 dan of fertilizer in seven days. Subsequently, he organized all county cadres to visit and intern. Soon, a fertilizer accumulation upsurge was launched. The entire county established more than 1,200 granular fertilizer plants and built more than 5,000 artificial manure ponds and urine pits, achieving the plan of accumulating 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

    Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, cadres in all districts, townships, and communes have learned to use this method to promote production.

    Tengchong County was originally a county in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture where various tasks progressed slowly. Due to the promotion of advanced experiences, the overall situation in the county has completely changed in the past two months. In terms of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and spring plowing production, it has caught up to be at the forefront of the prefecture.

    从报纸上学习先进经验
    腾冲县各项工作飞跃前进
    本报讯　云南省腾冲县积极学习报纸上登载的外地先进经验，并和本地情况结合起来，成为在县内推广技术革新的一种重要方法。
    中共腾冲县委订了许多份中央的和各省的报纸，并指定专人阅读，从中寻觅适合在当地推广的先进经验。看准一条后，即一面迅速通知区、乡、社全面组织学习，一面由县委的同志进行试验。成功后，就召开会议，组织参观实习，立即推广。在积肥运动中，县委书记孔繁耀同志，在云南日报上看到创造颗粒肥料、人造牛粪、大粪和高温速效堆肥等各种先进办法后，就到小西乡作试验，七天中积肥十四万担。接着，便组织全县干部参观实习。很快就掀起了积肥热潮。全县共建立了一千二百多个颗粒肥料厂，修起了五千多个人造粪塘和尿坑，实现了每亩万斤的积肥计划。
    在县委的带动下，全县区、乡、社的干部，都学会了运用这个方法，来推动生产。
    腾冲县原是德宏傣族景颇族自治州各项工作进展较慢的一个县，由于先进经验的推广，在最近的两个月中，全县的面貌已经完全改观，水利、积肥和春耕生产等方面，已赶在全州的最前列。
