Xinhua News Agency Report: Yunnan's "Borderland Literature" published in Kunming has released a special folk song issue in its June edition. The special issue includes five sections: "Leap Forward Mountain Songs Soar to the Sky," "Sunflowers Face the Sun," and "Factory and Mine Ballads," collecting over two hundred folk songs from twenty ethnic groups (including branches). The minority ethnic folk songs are generally well-translated, with most preserving the original style and charm of the songs.

Yunnan folk songs are rich and colorful, and it is known as the home of poetry. However, before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups were "singing songs with bitter words in their mouths, every line filled with suffering." The elderly and deaf Ruan Yongjian sang: "Crossing the Silver River, crossing the Golden River, working hard for ten years in my heart, the great leap forward in agricultural production, even this old man sings mountain songs." Only those who strive for progress in the Great Leap Forward can sing such heartstirring songs.

    力争上游的人唱动人心弦的歌
    云南“边疆文艺”出版民歌专号
    据新华社讯　云南昆明出版的“边疆文艺”6月号出版了各族民歌专号。专号包括“跃进山歌飞上天”、“朵朵葵花向太阳”、“工厂矿山歌谣”等五辑，收集了二十个民族（包括支系）的两百多首民歌。其中少数民族民歌都翻译得较好，大部分都保存了原歌的风韵。
    云南民歌十分丰富多彩，被称为诗的家乡。但解放前各族人民是“口含黄连唱歌子，句句都是苦声音”。年迈耳聋的阮永蹇唱道：“过了银河过金河，苦干十年记心窝，农业生产大跃进，老汉我也唱山歌。”只有在大跃进中力争上游的人才能唱出这样动人心弦的歌。
