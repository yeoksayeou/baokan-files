The person in charge of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture told reporters: This year, Hunan Province reversed the historically low yield of rapeseed and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed. The province's more than 3.42 million mu of rapeseed yielded an average of 77.5 jin of rapeseed per mu, an increase of 46% over last year. Eleven counties have achieved "100-jin rapeseed counties." The total output of rapeseed in the province is expected to reach more than 2.66 million dan, an increase of 130% over last year.

The person in charge said that the most important reason for the reversal of the low rapeseed yield was that the party committees at all levels strengthened their specific leadership over rapeseed production while grasping grain production. Various localities widely publicized policies such as the unchanged rapeseed purchase task for three years and no increase in purchases for increased production, which greatly increased the enthusiasm for producing oil crops.

In the past, because there was no one specifically in charge of rapeseed production, farmers neglected cultivation and management, and generally only harvested about 50 jin per mu. In particular, with the expansion of the double-cropping rice area, a conflict arose between planting rapeseed and seizing the season for transplanting rice seedlings. Some people were afraid of affecting the rice transplanting season and failing to complete the "three guarantees" plan, resulting in production losses for the team. Therefore, about one-third of the rapeseed area was plowed into fertilizer every year. This year, various localities resolved the ideological problems of the masses through large-scale debates to calculate the gains and losses of plowing rapeseed; and adopted concrete measures to increase the province's guaranteed rapeseed area by more than 800,000 mu compared with last year.

The person in charge said: This year, there have also been great improvements in farming techniques. In the Dongting Lake area, broadcasting was generally changed to spot sowing; in areas with spot sowing habits, sparse planting was generally changed to dense planting. Various localities also promoted yield-increasing measures such as careful land preparation, selection of fine varieties, ditching and drainage, and topdressing of moss fertilizer.

The person in charge said: Judging from the rapeseed harvest this year, it is very uneven. The highest yield per mu is more than 700 jin, while the lowest is only more than 30 jin, indicating that the potential for increasing rapeseed production is very large. This winter, the province will focus on rapeseed production and strive for self-sufficiency in edible oil for the entire province. (Gao Changren, Hu Jian)

### 单产提高四成六　总产增加一倍三  湖南改变油菜低产面貌

    单产提高四成六　总产增加一倍三
    湖南改变油菜低产面貌
    本报讯　湖南省农业厅负责人对记者说：今年湖南省扭转了历史上油菜低产的局面，获得油菜大面积丰收。全省三百四十二万多亩油菜，平均每亩产菜籽七十七斤半，比去年增产四成六。有十一个县实现了“油菜百斤县”。全省油菜籽总产量，预计可达二百六十六万多担，比去年增产一倍三。
    这位负责人说，油菜扭转低产局面最主要的原因是各级党委在抓粮食生产的同时，加强了对油菜生产的具体领导。各地广泛宣传了油料定购任务三年不变，增产不增购等政策，大大提高生产油料的积极性。
    过去由于没有专人领导油菜生产，农民忽视培育管理，一般每亩只收五十斤左右。特别是随着双季稻面积扩大，种油菜与抢季节插秧产生了矛盾。有些群众怕影响了插秧季节，完不成“三包”计划，队里赔产，因此每年约有三分之一的油菜面积被犁掉作肥料。今年各地通过大辩论算犁掉油菜的得失账，解决了群众的思想问题；并采取具体措施，全省油菜保收面积较去年约增加八十多万亩。
    这位负责人说：今年在耕作技术上也有很大的改进。在洞庭湖地区普遍改撒播为点播；在有点播习惯的地区，普遍改稀植为密植，各地还推行了精细整地、选用良种、开沟排水和追施苔肥等增产措施。
    这位负责人说：从今年油菜丰收的情况来看，很不平衡。最高亩产七百多斤，少的只收三十多斤，说明油菜增产潜力很大。今年冬天，全省要大抓油菜生产，力争全省食油自给。　（高长任、胡坚）
