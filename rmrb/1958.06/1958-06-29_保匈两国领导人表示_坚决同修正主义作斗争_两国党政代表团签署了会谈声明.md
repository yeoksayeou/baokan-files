Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 27th: A grand mass rally was held here today to welcome the Hungarian Party and Government delegation led by Kádár.

Zhivkov, Yugov, and other Bulgarian Party and Government leaders attended the mass rally.

Zhivkov spoke first at the rally. He said that the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party resolutely and ruthlessly oppose any revisionism, whether it is the revisionism of right-wing social democrats, the revisionism of the so-called "Petofi Club," the Nagy elements, or the revisionism in the program of the Yugoslav communists. Revisionism is always revisionism—an agent of imperialism in the workers' movement.

Zhivkov pointed out that the parties of Bulgaria and Hungary do not seek any so-called "own" road to building socialism, but advance along the well-tested road of the great October Socialist Revolution.

He also emphasized that the two fraternal countries of Bulgaria and Hungary are firmly united in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and contribute to further strengthening the unity of this camp.

Zhivkov said that the Bulgarian people fully support the verdict on Nagy and other counter-revolutionary elements, considering this verdict to be just and necessary. This verdict is of great significance not only for Hungary but also of great international significance. It is a stern warning to all despicable traitors who betray socialism and communism, and to every traitor who betrays the socialist motherland.

Kádár then spoke at the rally. He said that today the Yugoslav communist program represents revisionism in its most complete form worldwide. In order to defend the vital interests of our people, our working class, and our party, it is necessary to wage an irreconcilable struggle against the revisionist worldview.

Kádár said that in the struggle against revisionism, we will adhere to the following principles: adhere to our Marxist-Leninist position and socialist domestic and foreign policies, and make no concessions to revisionism; we will closely unite with the peoples of all socialist countries, maintain unity with the forces that have consistently helped the Hungarian people's cause, and closely unite with all fraternal parties in the Soviet Union, China, Bulgaria, and other countries that consistently oppose the revisionist ideas of the Yugoslav communist program.

Speaking about the domestic situation, Kádár pointed out that a struggle against bourgeois ideology, revisionist ideology, and various reactionary political views is currently underway in Hungary. He also stated that their country will do its utmost to resolutely and decisively crack down on those thugs who dare to oppose the legitimate system of the People's Republic and the power of the working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 27th: The talks between the Party and Government delegations of Bulgaria and Hungary concluded here on June 27. On the same afternoon, a statement of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and the Government of the People's Republic of Hungary was signed.

The statement was signed on behalf the Bulgarian side by Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Member the Presidium of the National Assembly, and on behalf of the Hungarian side by Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State.

The statement will be published on June 29. At the end of the talks, a consular agreement and an agreement on resolving issues of dual nationality between the two countries were also signed.

On the same evening, Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, held a reception for the Hungarian Party and Government delegation at the Council of Ministers Building.

    保匈两国领导人表示
    坚决同修正主义作斗争
    两国党政代表团签署了会谈声明
    新华社索非亚27日电　今天在这里举行了隆重的群众大会，欢迎以卡达尔为首的匈牙利党和政府代表团。
    日夫科夫、于哥夫等保加利亚党政领导人参加了群众大会。
    日夫科夫首先在大会上讲话。他说，保加利亚共产党和匈牙利社会主义工人党坚决无情地反对任何修正主义，右翼社会民主党人的修正主义也好，所谓“裴多菲俱乐部”的修正主义也好，纳吉分子也好，南共纲领中的修正主义也好，修正主义永远是修正主义——帝国主义在工人运动中的代理人。
    日夫科夫指出，保、匈两国的党不寻找任何所谓“自己的”建设社会主义的道路，而是沿着久经考验的伟大的十月社会主义革命的道路前进。
    他还强调指出保、匈两个兄弟国家牢固地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营里，并对进一步加强这个阵营的团结作出自己的贡献。
    日夫科夫说，保加利亚人民完全拥护对纳吉和其他反革命分子的判决，认为这一判决是正义的和必要的。这个判决不仅对于匈牙利具有重大意义，而且具有重大的国际意义。这对于背叛社会主义和共产主义的一切卑鄙叛徒、对于背叛社会主义祖国的每一个卖国贼是一个严正的警告。
    卡达尔接着在大会上讲话。他说，今天南共纲领以最完整的形式表现了世界范围内的修正主义。为了捍卫我国人民、我国工人阶级和我们党的切身重大利益，同修正主义的世界观进行不调和的斗争是必要的。
    卡达尔说，在反对修正主义的斗争中，我们将遵循以下原则：坚持我们的马克思列宁主义立场和社会主义的内外政策，不对修正主义作任何让步；我们将同社会主义各国人民紧密团结，将同一贯帮助匈牙利人民的事业的力量保持团结，将同一致反对南共纲领的修正主义思潮的苏联、中国、保加利亚和其他国家的一切兄弟党紧密团结。
    卡达尔在谈到国内情况时指出，目前在匈牙利正在展开对资产阶级思想、修正主义思想和各种反动政治观点的斗争。他还谈到他们的国家将竭尽全力、坚决果断地打击那些胆敢反对人民共和国的合法制度，反对劳动人民政权的歹徒。
    新华社索非亚27日电　保加利亚和匈牙利两国党政代表团的会谈6月27日在这里结束。当天下午签署了保加利亚共产党中央委员会、保加利亚人民共和国政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、匈牙利人民共和国政府的声明。
    保加利亚方面在声明上签字的是保共中央第一书记、国民议会主席团委员日夫科夫，匈牙利方面签字的是匈牙利社会主义工人党中央第一书记、国务部长卡达尔。
    声明将在6月29日发表。会谈结束时还签订了两国的领事协定和有关解决双重国籍问题的协定。
    同一天晚上，保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫在部长会议大厦为匈牙利党政代表团举行招待会。
