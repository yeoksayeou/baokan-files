On-site Meetings - A Marxist Method of Leadership

    With the emergence of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, significant improvements have also occurred in the methods of holding meetings. Many specialized conferences previously held annually in Beijing by various central departments have now largely moved from Beijing to production sites. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources alone have held more than ten national or regional conferences on-site since last winter. Leadership organs at all levels across the country are also widely using on-site meetings to solve various problems in a timely manner. Recently, conferences held by various provinces and regions to summarize the summer harvest and make early arrangements for winter planting and the high tide of winter water conservancy construction have also mostly taken the form of on-site meetings.

    Moving meetings from the capital to the localities, from cities to the countryside, and from offices to the field, may seem like just a matter of changing the meeting address; but in fact, there's much more to it than that. The specialized conferences originally held in Beijing or major cities, except for a few that were well-organized, often followed the old pattern of bureaucratic formalities and failed to solve concrete problems. Many vivid events and experiences from actual work often became bloodless, fleshless, bland, and completely lost their power to move people. When relayed layer by layer, the content was reduced layer by layer. When it reached the grassroots level, often only a few sentences or orders remained. The situation with on-site meetings is different. At these meetings, those who can truly present concrete experiences, answer specific questions, provide physical objects, and even perform demonstrations in person are the main speakers. Vague and empty talk doesn't fly here. This is a genuine meeting. Everyone hears and sees living facts. They can listen, watch, do, and discuss at the same time. Using their ears, eyes, hands, and brains simultaneously, it's lively, engaging, and refreshing. Problems, including ideological, practical, and technical ones, can be solved in a matter of days. Many grassroots cadres, after attending on-site meetings, commented: "On-site meetings allow us to thoroughly understand the situation and solve problems completely;" "We lose more at meetings in the city, and gain more at on-site meetings;" "Three days of an on-site meeting are worth a season's harvest." Wherever on-site meetings are well-organized, cadres and the masses are clear-headed and full of energy, which has greatly contributed to the leap forward in production. Xinghua County in Jiangsu Province achieved high yields and abundant harvests throughout the county. Some people believed this was due to the good natural conditions of Xinghua County, so its high-yield experience could not be effectively promoted. In March of this year, a national rapeseed conference was held in Xinghua County. After on-site visits, those who originally thought Xinghua's conditions were good now realized that they were not only not good, but very bad. Only then did they realize that the failure to improve rapeseed yields was due to conservative thinking. The meeting, including visits and discussions, only took three days, and the problem was solved. Before the meeting even ended, representatives from some provinces rushed to send telegrams back home, ordering their local areas to take emergency measures to increase rapeseed production.

    The reason why on-site meetings can be fast and effective is fundamentally because they can delve into practice and directly engage with concrete things. Therefore, it is possible to recognize and explain things according to their original appearance, as required by materialism.

    The more vividly and concretely professional conferences reflect the practice of the masses, and the more practical the resolutions made, the more effectively they can guide the relevant work. In this regard, the best way is to go to the field to observe, experience, investigate, and research. "No one can understand anything without contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." Because "all true knowledge originates from direct experience" ("On Practice"). The broad masses are creating new experiences and raising new questions in production and construction every day. It is difficult for leaders to truly understand these new things by merely listening to reports and reading reports. Because the vivid and rich reality of life, when written into articles on paper, is often difficult to fully maintain its original appearance. After layers of excerpts or oral reports, it is even easier to become distorted due to the different ideological levels of each person. Therefore, it is impossible to completely avoid subjectivism by summarizing experiences and deciding on problems based solely on reports and written materials. This is just as "On Practice" says, only when the sensory materials are very rich and consistent with reality can correct concepts and theories be created based on such materials. Many experiences that were widely promoted and effective in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production already existed several years ago. Why couldn't they be widely promoted earlier? An important reason is that they were passed around verbally or in writing, but no one had a practical understanding of them, so there was no question of summarizing, improving, and widely promoting them. During this production upsurge, various localities organized large-scale visits, exhibitions, and on-site meetings, which allowed people to have personal experiences and deep understanding of many original experiences, and thus quickly achieved widespread promotion.

    Currently, the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese people on the production front are causing reality to change with each passing day. If we want to stand at the forefront of the times, lead the masses forward, and not be left behind by the masses, we must pay attention to making our ideological understanding conform to the development of objective reality, and be able to recognize and grasp new things when they are still in their infancy. Here, on-site direct observation and in-depth research are of great significance. Comrade Mao Zedong, in "On Contradiction," talked about the need to look at both the overall contradiction and the characteristics of each aspect of the contradiction, denying the need to deeply study the characteristics of the contradiction within things, and merely standing there looking at them from afar, roughly seeing a little of the appearance of the contradiction, and then trying to solve the contradiction. Such a practice is bound to cause chaos. The problem of promoting double-wheeled double-shared plows is an example of the situation described above. Originally, after several years of promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows, there had been many successful examples in various places. However, some people did not go deep into the field to carefully analyze and study those examples, and did not recognize the various aspects of the contradiction in the promotion work (ideological issues and technical issues). They merely based their decisions on some one-sided reflections. Therefore, when a wave of anti-"rash advance" swept in, the errors of "demolishing double-wheeled double-shared plows" and "returning double-wheeled double-shared plows to the furnace" occurred. In February of this year, fourteen southern provinces and cities held an on-site meeting in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, to exchange experiences in the modification, evaluation, and promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows in the south. Introducing experiences combined with on-site visits and evaluations solved a series of technical and production management problems caused by the use of double-shared plows. In particular, an operation demonstration of a modified double-shared plow plowing paddy fields in Jiaokeng Township completely eliminated all doubts that double-shared plows were not suitable for paddy fields in southern regions. Double-shared plows had once been seen as an "ugly daughter-in-law" that could not be shown to others, but now they have finally regained their reputation. The promotion work has also been carried out on a large scale.

    No advanced experience is mature and complete from the beginning; it needs to be supplemented, revised, and improved. Backward areas or units are not backward in all aspects; they often have some advanced aspects. Through on-site meetings, visits, evaluations, and joint discussions, we can learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so that advanced experiences can be perfected. An on-site meeting held by the Yulin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yulin County’s Guidebao Township “Thousand Jin Gully” – Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative in March of this year illustrates this point. The representatives from more than one hundred cooperatives who participated in this meeting learned from the Huayuangou Cooperative's experience in achieving a thousand jin of grain per mu, and also made many good suggestions to the Huayuangou Cooperative. Some representatives suggested that they manufacture a large amount of granular fertilizer, raise more pigs, and grow more alfalfa to solve long-term fertilizer problems; some suggested that they use new-style agricultural tools to replace draft animals; and representatives from Liuguanzhai also taught them the method of high-temperature composting of sand ash. This made the Huayuangou Cooperative realize that their experience still had many shortcomings, and that abundant harvests had not yet reached their peak. They immediately held a meeting to study and formulate a plan to further improve their work.

    When leaders leave the office and come to the forefront of production and construction – the field – the distance between leadership and reality, and between leadership and the masses, is shortened and eliminated. Conducting joint research and discussions on the actual things in front of them on the spot can connect the ideas of leaders and the masses, and superiors and subordinates, so that everyone's understanding tends to be consistent. When everyone works together in the same direction, it is not difficult to mobilize all positive factors and fully utilize people's wisdom. According to the demands of the masses, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of Hebei Province decided to develop small-scale hydropower. But they had no leadership experience and no technical personnel, and there was no way to do it. Later, they gathered hundreds of carpenters, stonemasons, and bricklayers and held an on-site meeting on small hydropower stations in Chen Guantun, Jinghai County. Here, the leading cadres worked together with the masses, doing and studying at the same time. As a result, all the difficulties in manpower and materials were solved easily. In just five days, a small hydropower station was built, and personnel for developing small-scale hydropower in the entire prefecture were trained. What an amazing speed! After on-site meetings, many leading comrades felt that they had begun to be down-to-earth, had a foundation, and had more confidence and certainty in leading the production and construction movement.

    Our era is an era of leaping development in production, and also an era of prosperity and flourishing of dialectical materialism. The various improvements in leadership methods and meeting methods are the application of dialectical materialism in practical work. This improvement is greatly conducive to our country's building of socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and can also further transform our subjective world (thinking) and make it more in line with objective reality.

    现场会议——马克思主义的领导方法
    随着工农业生产高潮的出现，开会的方法也发生了显著的改进。中央各部门过去每年在北京召开的许多专业会议，大部分都从北京搬到生产现场去了。仅仅农业、水利两个部，自去冬以来在现场召开的全国性或区域性的会议就有十多个。全国各地各级领导机关，也普遍运用现场会议来及时地解决各种问题。最近以来，各省区总结夏收，提前布置冬播和冬季水利建设高潮的会议，又多半采取了现场会议的形式。
    会议从首都搬到地方，从城市搬到农村，从办公室搬到现场，看起来似乎只是个开会地址问题；其实不然，这里面大有文章。原来在北京或各地中心城市召开的专业会议，除了一部分开的好的以外，很多沿用老一套的官样文章，不能具体解决问题。实际工作中的许许多多生动的事迹和经验，到这里往往变得无血无肉，平淡乏味，完全失去了感人的力量。一层层往下传达，一层层减少内容。传到基层，往往只剩了几句话或几道命令。现场会议的情形就不同了。在这种会议上，真正拿得出具体经验、能够回答各种具体询问、拿得出实物、甚至能够亲自表演的人，才是会议的主要发言人，不着边际的空话到这里吃不开了，这是一种货真价实的会议。大家耳朵听的，眼睛看的，都是活生生的事实。可以一边听，一边看，一边做，一边讨论。眼耳手脑同时运用，生动活泼，新鲜愉快。几天的功夫就可以解决问题，包括思想问题和实际问题、技术问题。许多基层干部在开过现场会议之后的舆论是：“现场会议，情况摸得透，问题解决得彻底”；“城里开会丢的多，现场开会捞的多”；“三天现场会议顶收一季庄稼”。凡是现场会议开得好的地方，干部、群众一个个心明眼亮，干劲十足，对生产跃进起了很大的作用。江苏省兴化县得到了全县高额丰产，一般人认为是因为兴化县的自然条件好，因此它的高产经验总不能有效推广。今年3月在兴化县召开了全国油菜会议，经过现场参观，原来认为兴化条件好的，现在才知道它不仅不好，而且很坏，这才认识到油菜产量提不高，原来是保守思想在作怪。会议参观、座谈一共只花了三天时间，问题就解决了。会议还没有结束，有些省的代表就抢着打电报回去，叫本地采取紧急措施提高油菜产量。
    现场会议所以能够又快又好，根本原因是它能深入实践，直接接触具体的事物，所以就有可能像唯物主义所要求的那样，按照事物的本来面目认识和解释事物。
    专业会议越能生动地具体地反映群众的实践，作出的决议越切合实际，就越能在有关的业务中发挥指导的作用。在这一方面，最好的办法就是到现场去观察体验，调查研究。“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”因为“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”（“实践论”）。广大群众每天都在生产建设上创造新经验，提出新问题；领导者仅凭听汇报和看报告，是很难切实了解这些新东西的。因为生动丰富的现实生活，写成纸面文章，往往难于完全保持它原有的面貌。经过层层摘抄或口头传报，则因各人思想水平不同而更容易走样。所以，仅仅根据汇报和书面材料来总结经验，决定问题，要想完全避免主观主义是不可能的。这也正如“实践论”所说，只有感觉的材料十分丰富和合于实际，才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念和论理来。生产大跃进高潮中普遍推广而行之有效的经验，有许多是几年以前就有了的。为什么不能早些普遍推广呢？一个重要的原因就是在口头上或书面上传来传去，谁对它都没有切实的了解，自然也就谈不上总结提高，普遍推广。在这次生产高潮中，各地组织了大规模的参观展览和现场会议，这才使人们对原来的许多经验有了亲身的体验和深刻的认识，因而很快地得到普遍推广。
    目前我国人民群众在生产战线上空前高涨的积极性和创造性，使现实生活正在日新月异地发生变化。我们要站在时代的前头，领导群众前进，而不被群众抛在后边，就要注意使自己的思想认识符合客观实际的发展，当新事物还处在萌芽状态的时候，就要能识别它，抓住它。在这里，现场的直接的观察和深入的研究，具有重大的意义。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中谈到，对矛盾总体和矛盾各方的特点都不去看，否认深入事物里面精细地研究矛盾特点的必要，仅仅站在那里远远地望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的形相，就想动手去解决矛盾，这样的做法，没有不出乱子的。在推广双轮双铧犁的问题上，就发生了类似上面所说的情况。本来，双轮双铧犁经过几年来的推广，各地已经有了不少成功的典型例子。可是有些人并不深入现场去仔细分析研究那些例子，不认识推广工作当中矛盾的各个方面（思想问题与技术问题），仅仅凭一些片面的反映来决定问题，于是，当一股反“冒进”的风卷来的时候，“拆毁双轮双铧犁”，“双轮双铧犁回炉”的错误就发生了。今年2月，南方十四省、市在浙江省黄岩县开了一次现场会议，进行南方双轮双铧犁改装评比和推广使用的经验交流。介绍经验结合现场参观评比，使用双铧犁所引起的技术上、生产管理上一系列的问题都解决了。特别是在焦坑乡举行的一次改装后的双铧犁耕水田的操作表演，彻底扫除了双铧犁不适用于南方水田地区的种种怀疑。双铧犁曾经被人看成见不得人的“丑媳妇”，现在才算恢复了名誉。推广工作也就大规模地开展起来。
    任何先进经验，都不是一开始就很成熟很完全的，都有待于补充、修正和提高。落后的地区或单位，也不是一切方面都落后，它们往往也有一些先进的地方。通过现场会议进行参观评比，共同讨论，能够取长补短，互相补充，使先进经验臻于完善。中共陕西榆林地委今年3月在榆林县归德堡乡“千斤沟”——花园沟农业社召开的一次现场会议，就说明了这一点。参加这次会议的一百多个社的代表，学习了花园沟社粮食千斤丰产经验，同时也向花园沟社提出了许多好的建议。有的代表建议他们大量制造颗粒肥料，多养猪、多种草木樨解决长远的肥料问题；有的建议他们换耕畜使用新式农具；刘官寨的代表还把本社高温沤沙灰的办法亲手教给他们。这就使得花园沟社认识到自己的经验还有许多不足之处，丰产也并没有到顶，他们当即开会研究，订出进一步改进工作的计划。
    领导者离开办公室，来到生产建设的最前线——现场，领导与实际，领导与群众之间的距离缩短了，消除了。在现场上对摆在眼前的实际事物进行共同的研究和讨论，可以沟通领导与群众、上级和下级之间的思想，使大家认识趋于一致。上下左右拧成一股劲，这就不难把一切积极因素都发动起来，把人们的智慧充分发挥出来。河北省天津地委根据群众要求，决定发展小型水力发电事业。但一没有领导经验，二没有技术人材，没有办法。后来他们把几百名木工、石工、泥瓦工集中起来，在静海县陈官屯召开了一个小型水电站的现场会议。在这里，领导干部和群众一起动手，一边做，一边研究，结果所有一切人力物力的困难都迎刃而解。仅仅五天工夫，就建成了一个小型水电站，同时也训练了全专区发展小型水电事业的人材。这是何等惊人的速度！经过现场会议，许多领导同志都感觉到自己开始脚踏实地，有根有底了，对于领导生产建设运动也更有信心，更有把握了。
    我们的时代，是生产飞跃发展的时代，也是辩证唯物主义繁荣昌盛的时代。领导方法和开会方法的种种改进，就是辩证唯物主义在实际工作中的运用。这种改进大大地有利于我们国家多快好省地建设社会主义，也能够使我们的主观世界（思想）进一步得到改造，更符合于客观实际。
