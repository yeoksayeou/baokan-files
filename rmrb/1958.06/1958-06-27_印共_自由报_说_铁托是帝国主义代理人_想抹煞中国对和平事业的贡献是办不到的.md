Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 26th: The Indian Communist newspaper "Freedom Daily," published in Calcutta, recently published an editorial entitled "Socialist or Imperialist Agent?" refuting Tito's speech on June 15th in Labin.

The editorial rebuked Tito for slandering China's opposition to easing international tensions and equating China with the most reactionary warmongers in the West.

The editorial pointed out that Tito's frantic attacks on China are not difficult to understand. The editorial stated that the Chinese Communist Party has proven through theoretical analysis as well as various facts and figures that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is nothing more than revisionism. The Chinese leaders have said that socialism is like the rising sun, while imperialism is like the setting sun obscured by dark clouds. Now, Yugoslav revisionists, under the guise of Marxism-Leninism, are serving imperialism, especially American imperialism.

The editorial said that Tito, embarrassed by the statements made by Chinese leaders and the Chinese Communist Party exposing the true face of Yugoslav revisionists, immediately slandered China as a warmonger. Tito may continue to clamor, but peace-loving people all over the world will not be deceived by his words. The ordinary people of the world, especially in Asia and Africa, cannot and will not forget that China was the first country to sign the declaration of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence along with India. The editorial also listed China's contributions to easing international tensions at the Bandung Conference, on the Korean armistice issue, on the establishment of peace in Indochina, and at the Geneva Conference. The editorial said that no matter how many malicious remarks Tito makes, he cannot erase this fact.

The editorial also said that recently, China also withdrew its volunteer army from Korea, thus creating a peaceful atmosphere in the Far East, but the American imperialists, whom Tito and his followers serve, refused to withdraw their troops from Korea.

In this regard, it should also be pointed out that when the American imperialists were helping Indonesian rebels with money and weapons, China expressed its willingness to provide Indonesia with various forms of assistance when necessary. When China unequivocally expressed its support for the liberation struggles of Arab countries, Yugoslav revisionists were frantically attempting to undermine the national liberation movement and split the anti-imperialist patriotic front in Arab countries.

The editorial said that Khaled Bagdash, General Secretary of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, has revealed to the world how the Belgrade revisionist group is serving American imperialism in Arab countries. He said that the Belgrade revisionist group is trying to separate the communist movement in Arab countries from the international communist movement. They are also trying to separate the Arab national liberation movement from the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism.

The editorial pointed out that Tito began to engage in slander to cover up their bad deeds. Undoubtedly, American leaders will be pleased with Tito's slander campaign. They will be satisfied to see that dollar aid to Yugoslavia will bear fruit. The activities of Yugoslav revisionists have led the American imperialists to say: Tito's interests and our interests are developing in parallel towards the same direction.

The editorial concluded by pointing out that Tito's slanderous attacks on China once again prove that Tito's Yugoslavia is acting as an agent of the imperialist camp.

### 印共“自由报”说  铁托是帝国主义代理人  想抹煞中国对和平事业的贡献是办不到的

    印共“自由报”说
    铁托是帝国主义代理人
    想抹煞中国对和平事业的贡献是办不到的
    新华社新德里26日电　在加尔各答出版的印度共产党报纸“自由报”最近以“是社会主义者，还是帝国主义代理人？”为题发表社论，驳斥铁托6月15日在拉宾发表的演说。
    社论斥责铁托污蔑中国反对缓和国际紧张局势并且把中国同西方最反动的战争贩子等同起来。
    社论指出，铁托对中国进行疯狂的攻击是不难理解的。社论说，中国共产党已经通过理论分析以及各种事实和数字证明南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领只不过是修正主义。中国的领导人说过，社会主义好像是初升的太阳，而帝国主义却好像是被阴云遮蔽的落日。现在，南斯拉夫修正主义者却在马克思列宁主义的伪装下，为帝国主义特别是美帝国主义服务。
    社论说，铁托被中国领导人和中国共产党发表的揭穿南斯拉夫修正主义者的真面目的言论弄得狼狈不堪，他竟然立即诬蔑中国为战争贩子。铁托可能继续叫嚷，但是全世界爱好和平的人民决不会被他的话所迷惑。全世界特别是亚非地区的普通人民不能也决不会忘记中国是同印度一起在和平共处五项原则的宣言上签字的第一个国家。社论还列举了中国在万隆会议上、朝鲜停战问题上、在印度支那建立和平问题上和日内瓦会议上为缓和国际紧张局势所作出的贡献。社论说，不管铁托发表多少恶毒的言论，都抹煞不了这个事实。
    社论还说，最近，中国还把它的志愿军撤出了朝鲜，这样来在远东造成和平气氛，但是铁托及其追随者所效劳的美帝国主义者却拒绝从朝鲜撤退他们的军队。
    在这个方面，还应该指出，当美帝国主义者用金钱和武器帮助印度尼西亚叛乱分子的时候，中国却表示愿意在必要的时候给予印度尼西亚以各种援助。当中国毫不含糊地表示支持阿拉伯国家的解放斗争的时候，南斯拉夫修正主义者却在疯狂地企图破坏民族解放运动并且分裂阿拉伯国家中的反帝爱国阵线。
    社论说，叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党总书记哈立德·巴格达什已经向全世界揭露了贝尔格莱德修正主义集团怎样在阿拉伯国家为美帝国主义服务。他说，贝尔格莱德的修正主义集团企图使阿拉伯国家里的共产主义运动同国际共产主义运动分开。他们还企图使阿拉伯民族解放运动离开反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    社论指出，铁托开始进行诽谤，以掩饰他们的恶劣行为。毫无疑问，美国领导人将对铁托的这种诽谤运动感到高兴。他们将满意地看到对南斯拉夫的美元援助将会产生果实。南斯拉夫修正主义者的活动已经使得美帝国主义者说：铁托的利益和我们的利益正在向着同一个方向平行地发展着。
    社论最后指出，铁托攻击中国的谰言再一次证明了铁托的南斯拉夫正在充当帝国主义阵营的代理人。
