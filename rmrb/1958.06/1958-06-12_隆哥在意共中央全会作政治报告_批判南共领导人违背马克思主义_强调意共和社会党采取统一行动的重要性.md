Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 11th: According to TASS, the plenary session of the Central Committee and Central Auditing Commission of the Italian Communist Party opened in Rome on the 9th. Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Longo delivered a report at the meeting on the results of the Italian elections and the struggle for peace and the country's social and political reforms.

Longo said that the results of the parliamentary elections were a significant victory for the entire left-wing force, especially the Italian Communist Party. He pointed out that in the House of Representatives elections, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party won approximately 1.35 million more votes than in the previous election. They have 23 more seats in parliament than in the previous parliament. Currently, these two parties have nearly 11 million voters who are firmly oriented towards a policy of peace, democratic progress, and the realization of constitutional and economic reforms.

Longo pointed out that this left-wing force is not much weaker than the Christian Democratic group. However, the various forces within the Christian Democratic group do not have a consistent pace on some issues, while the left-wing parties are consistent in dealing with these issues. In addition, Social Democrats, Republicans, and members of the "Aosta Valley Union" also oppose the political monopoly of the Christian Democrats.

Longo said that first and foremost, it should be mentioned that the number of votes and seats won by the Italian Communist Party alone exceeds the sum of all other democratic parties. This proves the people's trust in the Communist Party, proves the Party's unity and activity, the Party's connection with the most active part of the residents, and the growth of the Party's combat capability and activity.

Longo emphasized that the election results proved that the people firmly demanded a change in the government and the Christian Democratic Party's current political direction. He also pointed out that the factional struggles within the Christian Democratic Party made the party itself unstable.

Longo spoke of the reactionary parties' attempts to isolate the strength supporting the Italian Communist Party from other democratic forces. He emphasized that now, more than ever, there is a need for the unity of the broadest anti-fascist and democratic forces, the unity of the working class, and the unified action of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

In this regard, Longo mentioned the events in France and Algeria. He emphasized that the leaders of the French Socialist Party surrendered to the rebellious generals in order to prevent the establishment of a Popular Front at all costs. Longo said that we express our complete fraternal solidarity with the French people.

Longo stressed that consultation and unified action between Communists and Socialists is of decisive significance for uniting all forces eager to change the direction of national policy.

Now, more than ever, it is necessary to establish fraternal cooperation with our Socialist friends in parliament and in mass struggles, in order to strive to meet the demands of the working people and resist the threatening impact of the American economic crisis, in order to solve the various problems facing Italy and hinder the rule of the church forces.

Longo also said that the position of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the issue of the world being divided into opposing blocs is surprising. He pointed out that the Yugoslav leaders' attempt to describe the relationship and contradictions between capitalist and socialist countries as contradictions between great powers for the division of spheres of influence and the struggle for world domination is absurd, violates history, and is anti-Marxist.

Longo said that we cannot remain silent about our major differences with the Yugoslav Communists, because the Yugoslav position is not only theoretically and historically wrong, but also a serious political danger.

    隆哥在意共中央全会作政治报告
    批判南共领导人违背马克思主义
    强调意共和社会党采取统一行动的重要性
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社罗马10日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会全体会议9日在罗马开幕。意大利共产党副总书记隆哥在会上作了关于意大利选举的结果和争取和平和国家的社会和政治改革的斗争的报告。
    隆哥说，议会选举的结果是整个左派力量，特别是意大利共产党的具有重要意义的大胜利。他指出，在众议院的选举中，共产党和社会党比上次选举多得了大约一百三十五万张选票。它们在议会中的议席比上届议会中多二十三个。目前这两个政党拥有将近一千一百万坚决以和平、民主进步、实现宪法和经济改革的政策为方向的选民。
    隆哥指出，这一左翼的力量比天主教民主党集团的力量差不了多少，然而天主教民主党集团内部的各种势力在一些问题上步调是不一致的，而左翼政党对待这些问题是一致的。此外，社会民主党人、共和党人和“奥斯塔山谷联盟”的成员也反对天主教民主党的政治垄断。
    隆哥说，但是首先应该提到，单是意大利共产党一个党所获得的票数和席位就超过了其他所有民主党派的总和。这就证明了人民对共产党的信任，证明了党的团结和活动力、党同居民中最积极的部分的联系以及党的战斗能力和活动力的增长。
    隆哥强调指出，选举的结果证明人民坚决要求改变政府和天主教民主党现行的政治方针。他还指出，天主教民主党内部的派别斗争使这个党本身不稳定了。
    隆哥说到反动党派企图把拥护意大利共产党的力量同其他民主力量隔绝开来。他强调指出，现在比以前任何时候都更需要最广泛的反法西斯力量和民主力量的团结，工人阶级的团结，以及共产党和社会党的统一行动。
    在这方面隆哥提到法国和阿尔及利亚的事件。他强调指出，法国社会党领导人为了不顾一切地防止建立人民阵线，对叛乱的将军投降。隆哥说，我们向法国人民表示完全的兄弟声援。
    隆哥着重指出，在共产党人和社会党人之间进行协商和统一行动，对于联合一切渴望改变国家政策方向的力量来说，具有决定性的意义。
    现在比任何时候都更加需要同社会党的朋友们在议会中和在群众斗争方面建立兄弟合作关系，以便争取满足劳动人民的要求和抵制具有威胁性的美国经济危机的影响，以便解决意大利面临的种种问题和阻挠教会力量的统治。
    隆哥还说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在世界分为对立集团问题上的立场使人感到吃惊。他指出，南共领导人企图把资本主义国家和社会主义国家之间的关系和矛盾说成是大国之间为划分势力范围和争夺世界统治地位的矛盾，这是荒谬的、违背历史的，也是反马克思主义的。
    隆哥说，不能闭口不谈我们同南共之间的重大分歧，因为南共的立场不仅在理论上和历史方面是错误的，而且在政治方面是一个严重危险。
