Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 25th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 24th, presided over by the party's General Secretary Maurice Thorez. The meeting adopted two important statements. The first statement addresses the current demands and urgent tasks of republicans and patriots; the second statement points out that workers and democratic forces must resolutely, powerfully, and swiftly repel attacks by fascist thugs.

The first statement emphasizes: The great future of France is based on domestic democracy and friendly relations with all peoples.

Therefore, domestically, republicans and patriots demand: First, respect for the basic principles of democratic institutions, which are: the establishment of a national representative body that conforms to the will of the people and is produced through direct and fair elections; the establishment of a government fully accountable to the national representative body; freedom for organized political parties to operate within a democratic system; and freedom for trade unions and other democratic organizations to operate. Second, the implementation of policies that conform to national interests and the aspirations of the people.

Externally, republicans and patriots demand: First, the establishment of relations with Algeria and the peoples of all colonies in accordance with the principles of recognizing freedom, independence, equal rights, and mutual benefit. Second, friendship with all peoples, rather than participation in aggressive blocs and arms races. Only by freeing itself from the dual burdens of colonial wars and the arms race can France regain its position as an independent great power.

The Political Bureau announced: In order to achieve these goals, the French Communist Party is prepared to consult with all republican forces to unite them in defending national interests, safeguarding democratic institutions, and ensuring that democratic institutions are implemented without obstruction.

In this regard, the Political Bureau emphasizes that the most urgent task for republicans and patriots at present is to guide the majority of French people to reject De Gaulle's draft constitutional amendment in the October 5th referendum, thereby thwarting personal dictatorship and blocking the path of fascism.

In the second statement, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party pointed out that just as De Gaulle continues to manipulate republicans and tries to numb the people's vigilance, those who support De Gaulle's rise to power are intensifying their attacks on the republic and democratic institutions. Republicans can only rely on themselves, on unity and action, to restrain fascist groups. Therefore, it is necessary to do everything possible to fight back against fascist criminal acts, protect the venues of democratic organizations and their members, and oppose fascist demonstrations and fascist atrocities.

    法共中央向爱国民主力量发出号召
    保卫民主反击法西斯暴行
    使法国摆脱殖民战争和军备竞赛同各国友好相处
    新华社巴黎25日电　法国共产党中央委员会政治局24日在党的总书记多列士主持下举行了会议。会上通过了两个重要声明。第一个声明谈到共和人士和爱国者当前的要求和迫切任务；第二个声明指出，工人和民主力量必须坚决有力地迅速回击法西斯暴徒的袭击。
    第一个声明着重指出：法国的伟大前途是建立在国内的民主和同各国人民友好的基础之上的。
    因此，在国内方面，共和人士和爱国者要求：第一，尊重民主制度的基本原则，这就是：建立符合人民意志的、通过直接而公正的选举产生的全国代议机构；成立完全对全国代议机构负责的政府；有组织政党的自由，政党在民主制度下有进行活动自由；工会和其他民主团体也有进行活动的自由。第二，执行符合民族利益和人民愿望的政策。
    在对外方面，共和人士和爱国者要求：第一，按照承认自由、独立、权利平等和互利的原则，同阿尔及利亚以及各殖民地人民建立关系。第二，同各国人民友好，而不是参加侵略性集团和进行军备竞赛。只有摆脱殖民战争和军备竞赛的双重重担，法国才能重新成为独立的大国。
    政治局宣布：为了达到这些目标，法国共产党准备同所有共和力量进行协商，以便一切共和力量团结起来保卫民族利益，维护民主制度，并且确保民主制度施行无阻。
    政治局就此着重指出，共和人士和爱国者目前最迫切的任务，是引导大多数法国人在10月5日的公民投票中否决戴高乐的宪法修改草案，从而挫败个人独裁，堵住法西斯主义的道路。
    在第二个声明中，法国共产党中央委员会政治局指出，正当戴高乐继续对共和人士玩弄手段并且竭力麻痹人民的警惕性的时候，拥护戴高乐上台的人们在加紧进攻共和国和民主制度。共和人士只有依靠自己，依靠团结和行动，才能使法西斯集团有所收敛。因此，必须竭尽全力反击法西斯犯罪行为，保护民主组织的会址和它们的成员，反对法西斯示威和法西斯暴行。
