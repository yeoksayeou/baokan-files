    Facilitating Rural Communication
    Wu Lü
    Bi Songzhou, a member of the Eleventh Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangrong Township, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, once received a money order notification. To collect this small amount of money, he had to travel a long distance to the county post office. Not only did he miss work, but his travel and accommodation expenses amounted to one yuan. It was truly a case of "a small matter, but a big price."
    Such a thing might be hard to imagine for people living in the city. In cities, letters and newspapers are delivered to the door by postmen; there are also many post offices and mailboxes, so there is no worry about sending letters or money. The situation in rural areas is different. Newspapers and mail can mostly only be delivered to the township and cooperative level. Everything below that level has to be forwarded by someone, which is not only slow but also prone to errors. As for sending letters, remitting money, and picking up packages, one has to travel a long distance to the county seat or market town where postal and telecommunications branches are located. Those who live far away have to miss work and pay for food and lodging.
    To solve this inconvenient situation of rural postal and telecommunications, building a complete rural postal and telecommunications network is an important task for the postal and telecommunications departments. In the past eight years, postal and telecommunications departments have done a lot of work in this regard. At present, the number of postal and telecommunications institutions in our country has increased fivefold compared with before liberation, and more than 70% of them are distributed in rural areas. However, due to the vast territory of our country, despite such great efforts, we have only managed to have an average of one postal and telecommunications branch for every four townships. Mail and newspapers below the township and cooperative level still cannot be delivered directly to households. It is estimated that if direct delivery to households is to be achieved, more than 100,000 additional postal and telecommunications workers will be needed nationwide, which is obviously a very difficult task. Therefore, although the state wants to actively develop the rural postal and telecommunications network, it is impossible to meet the needs of the masses in the short term by relying solely on the strength of the state.
    The agricultural cooperative postman system established in Heilongjiang Province provides us with a good experience in combining state power and mass power to quickly solve the problem of rural communication. Combining the strength of the state and the strength of the masses is our fundamental policy for doing everything. Of course, running postal and telecommunications services is no exception. Setting up a postman for several cooperatives or a township costs an average of only a few jiao per household per year, but it provides convenience for every family for a long time. This method is fully in line with the interests of the masses. As long as it is explained clearly to the masses, it will not be difficult to establish the agricultural cooperative postman system, relying on the combination of state power and mass power to solve the inconvenient problem of rural postal and telecommunications.
    With the development of the upsurge in agricultural production, the upsurge in local industrial construction, and the upsurge in culture, and with the large number of cadres going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, the inconvenience of rural postal and telecommunications has become more prominent. On the one hand, there are more people sending letters and subscribing to newspapers, and the volume of rural postal and telecommunications business has increased; on the other hand, there is a general shortage of labor in rural areas, and it is not easy to ask for leave to go to the city to send letters and subscribe to newspapers. Under these circumstances, solving the inconvenience of rural postal and telecommunications is indeed a matter of urgency; promoting the experience of establishing the agricultural cooperative postman system in Heilongjiang Province is also of more pressing significance.

    便利农村通信
    吴滤
    黑龙江省海伦县向荣乡第十一农业生产合作社的社员毕松洲，有一次收到一张汇款通知单，为了取这笔数目不多的钱，他远道赶到县里的邮局去，不但误了工，而且路上食宿费用就花了一块钱。真是“事情很小，代价不少”。
    这样的事，对住在城里的人，恐怕有些难以想像。城市里，信件报纸都有邮递员送上门；邮局邮筒也多得很，寄信汇钱都不发愁。农村里的情况就不一样了。报刊和邮件大都只能投递到乡和社，乡社以下只好托人捎转，不但时间慢，也容易出差错。至于寄信、汇款、取包裹，更要远道赶到设有邮电分支机构的县城或镇集上去，路途远的，就要误工，还得支付食宿费用。
    解决农村邮电通信这种不便的情况，建设一个完整的农村邮电网，是邮电部门的一项重要任务。过去八年来，邮电部门在这方面做了许多工作，目前我国的邮电机构已比解放前增加了五倍，其中70％以上都分布在农村。但由于我国幅员广阔，尽管作了这样巨大的努力，仍只做到平均每四个乡有一个邮电分支机构，乡社以下的邮件和报刊仍不能直投到户。据估计，如果要做到直投到户的话，全国就需要增加十万多名邮电职工，这显然是一件很难办到的事情。因此，国家虽然要积极发展农村邮电网，但单纯依靠国家的力量，是不可能在短期内满足群众要求的。
    黑龙江省建立的农业社邮递员制度，为我们提供了一个把国家力量和群众力量结合起来，迅速解决农村通信问题的良好的经验。把国家的力量和群众的力量结合起来，是我们办一切事业的根本方针。办邮电事业当然也不能例外。几个社或一个乡设立一名邮递员，平均每户农民全年只不过负担几角钱，得到的却是家家方便，长久方便。这种办法是完全符合群众利益的。只要同群众讲清楚，就不难把农业社邮递员制度建立起来，依靠国家力量和群众力量的结合，来解决农村邮电通信不便的问题。
    随着农业生产高潮、地方工业建设高潮和文化高潮的发展，随着大批干部上山下乡，农村邮电通信的不便更加突出。一方面是寄信的、订报的多了，农村邮电通信的业务量增加；另一方面是农村劳动力普遍不足，为了寄信订报请假进城很不容易。在这种情况下，解决农村邮电通信的不便，确是刻不容缓的事情；推广黑龙江省建立农业社邮递员制度的经验，也就有着更迫切的意义。
