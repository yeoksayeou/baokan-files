How Should Cultural and Educational Workers Implement the General Line?
Ruo Bo

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China formulated the general socialist construction line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This general line puts forward the great new revolutionary tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution. In the face of this new historical period and these new revolutionary tasks, how should we cultural and educational workers go all out, aim high, and conscientiously implement the general line of socialist construction?

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the "Work Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress": "For scientific, technological, cultural and educational workers, we should focus on educating them to resolutely implement the policy of integrating with reality, integrating with production, and integrating with the masses, so as to effectively serve the proletarian socialist cause and promote the development of social productive forces." This means that cultural and educational workers should contribute their wisdom, energy, and talents to current politics and social production, cooperate with the comprehensive great leap forward of socialist construction, and implement the general line.

Looking back, countless facts show that in intellectual circles and in our ranks of cultural and educational workers, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, there is a widespread and serious tendency to be divorced from reality, divorced from production, divorced from the masses, and especially divorced from politics, such as "education for education's sake," "managing teaching but not learning, teaching books but not teaching people," etc., resulting in serious losses to the cultural and educational cause. Aren't the many facts exposed in this rectification movement, the anti-rightist struggle, and the "double-anti" phase shocking enough? Aren't they enough to make people deeply reflect and wake up?

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao often teach us that our country is "poor and blank." "Poor" means we must build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; "blank" means we must develop cultural and educational undertakings and scientific and technological research with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, in order to serve the socialist construction cause with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Chairman Mao pointed out in the article "Introducing a Cooperative" that China's "poverty and blankness" of 600 million people seems like a bad thing, but it is actually a good thing. "Poverty leads to change, to work hard, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." We cultural and educational workers should not write the oldest and ugliest words or draw the oldest and ugliest pictures on this "blank sheet of paper." In the past, haven't those old traditions and pseudo-sciences in teaching and scientific research, such as valuing the past over the present, valuing foreign things over Chinese things, and blindly believing in books, written the oldest and ugliest words and drawn the oldest and ugliest pictures on this blank sheet of paper? Looking back, can you not feel ashamed?

Now, the Party has pointed out that we cultural and educational workers must resolutely implement this policy: integrate with reality, integrate with production, and integrate with the masses, so as to effectively serve the proletarian socialist cause and promote social productivity. Below, we will explore these two major services.

From the viewpoint of historical materialism, a certain culture reflects the ideology of a certain society's politics and economy. A certain cultural education serves a certain politics and economy. Politics is the commander, politics is the soul. Cultural education cannot be separated from politics and stand alone. The so-called "culture for culture's sake" and "education for education's sake" are actually hypocritical deceptions of the bourgeoisie. Cultural education either serves the bourgeoisie's capitalism or the proletariat's socialism; there is no other way. Besides the fact that many rightist elements emerged from the ranks of cultural and educational workers, why did many rightist elements appear among young students or why were many so-called "defective products" produced? It cannot be said that this was not created by bourgeois ideology in school education. Tang Youqi, a professor at Peking University, said: "While we gave students a lot of chemical knowledge, we instilled many bourgeois views and ideas into them, which encouraged students to be arrogant and alienated from politics"; these "soulless people are waste products for socialism." Young students educated by bourgeois teaching ideas, divorced from socialist politics, will inevitably tend towards bourgeois politics, thus leading to the emergence of many rightist elements among students. The reason for the bourgeois teaching idea of "culture for culture's sake" and "education for education's sake" lies in this. Lenin said that one of the manifestations of bourgeois hypocrisy is believing that schools can be separated from politics. And the bourgeoisie who put forward this principle themselves put bourgeois politics in the first place in school affairs, and tried their best to use schools to train running dogs and slaves of capital specifically for the bourgeoisie, and they never wanted to make schools a tool for cultivating personality.

Our country is a socialist country. The politics and economy of a socialist country must have socialist cultural education to serve it. We are speaking the truth of the proletariat, which is different from the lies of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie's sweet words conceal the selfish purpose of exploiting, oppressing, and fooling the working people, so they describe cultural education as the business of scholars and professors, and scientific research as the business of experts, creating superstition and mystery, and making it unattainable; while the proletariat's sincere intention is to develop and prosper the socialist culture, education, science, and technology of the motherland, and to cooperate with the rapid progress of socialist economic construction, so that the people of the whole country can enjoy a happier and better material and cultural life. The two kinds of thoughts and two roads are obvious. After more than a hundred years of revolutionary struggle, we have achieved the great victory of the people's revolution and established the People's Republic of China. From this time on, our country entered the transition period from capitalism to socialism. During the transition period, our politics has the struggle between ourselves and the enemy, and also the struggle within the people. Our cultural education must serve the politics based on these two types of contradictions, and must serve socialist revolution and socialist construction. During the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we carried out ideological education to eliminate fear of the U.S., worship of the U.S., and closeness to the U.S.; during the period of the socialist transformation of the three major sectors, we also carried out ideological struggles between the capitalist road and the socialist road; since last year's socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, we have launched an ideological struggle to "promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie," which is still continuing. These all show that the cultural education needed by the proletariat is subordinate to the proletariat's political struggle. This is "ordained" by the objectively existing law of social development, and those who follow it will prosper, and those who go against it will perish. Now, in addition to continuing the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and opposing imperialism and defending the motherland, the most important political task of our country is to build the socialist economic base and strive to implement the "general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism." This requires our cultural and educational undertakings to work hard under the close leadership of the Party and under the guidance of the general line to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. For example, in school education, we should implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running schools and combining work and study to improve the quality of teaching. Only in this way can cultural education directly or indirectly serve the cause of socialist construction.

What has been discussed above is the question of cultural education serving current politics, that is, serving the proletarian socialist cause. Now let's discuss the question of cultural education serving to promote social productivity.

We can imagine that after the Party put forward the new revolutionary tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution, the high tide of the cultural revolution will inevitably come with the high tide of the technological revolution. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report: "In order to adapt to the needs of the technological revolution, it is necessary to simultaneously carry out the cultural revolution and develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve economic construction." This means that the cultural revolution must serve the technological revolution. The proletariat must build socialism and communism, and must acquire all science, technology, and knowledge. From the perspective of socialist construction, the technological revolution is to rapidly develop productivity and build a prosperous, strong, happy, and beautiful great socialist country at the highest speed. Comrade Liu Shaoqi taught us in his report: "The question of construction speed is the most important question facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution. Our revolution is to develop social productivity as quickly as possible. Our country's economy was originally very backward, and there is imperialism outside our country. Only by speeding up construction as much as possible can we consolidate our socialist country and improve the people's living standards as soon as possible." Therefore, we must clearly recognize that our industry must catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or less; our agriculture must rapidly surpass capitalist countries on the basis of realizing the agricultural development program ahead of schedule. This certainly requires the vigorous development of cultural education, so that our science and technology can quickly realize the "Twelve-Year Science Development Plan," catch up with the most advanced levels in the world, and serve the war against the earth and the march towards nature. Since this year, many mass-improved tools and inventions have started the technological revolution in industrial and agricultural production; the elimination of illiteracy, the popularization of primary school education, people-run agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools, as well as mass cultural activities, science popularization work, the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, and the development of mass sports activities, etc., have started the cultural revolution. These cultural revolutions are closely combined with production and have promoted production. Historically, science, technology, and knowledge have all been produced, developed, and enriched because of the needs of production development and social struggle. Marx said, "In Egypt, the necessity of predetermining the rise and fall of the Nile River produced Egyptian astronomy, and then produced the dominance gained by the priestly class as agricultural guides." The more modern the times, the more science, technology, and knowledge have developed because of the needs of large-scale industries and the like. Socialist economic construction is advancing by leaps and bounds and changing rapidly every day. It is in a great leap forward era of unprecedented development of social productivity. If cultural education, science, technology, and knowledge do not keep up quickly, what contribution can they make to society and the people? Du Fen, a scientist in Kunming, said that his plan to study schistosomiasis would take at least a year to master the egg-laying period of snails, while many places have proposed to eliminate schistosomiasis within a year. If he continues to study according to the original plan, there will be no research objects left. Doesn't this show that cultural education and scientific research must catch up quickly and develop rapidly in order to keep up with the needs of the rapid development of social productivity?

In the previous period, why did some people deeply dyed with bourgeois ideology insist on "culture for culture's sake" and "education for education's sake"? Why did they themselves stay away from politics, reality, and production, and want to educate the younger generation to take the road of staying away from politics, reality, and production? Is this a lack of understanding of historical development, or a deliberate distortion of the status and role of cultural education in the superstructure of society? After the great debate on educational ideology during the "double-anti" movement, the exposure and criticism of bourgeois teaching ideas that were divorced from politics and reality, valuing the past over the present, valuing foreign things over Chinese things, valuing talent over virtue, as well as individualistic ideas of fame and gain such as being neither red nor expert, or only expert but not red, many professors, teachers, and scientists have begun to wake up and admit that cultural education and scientific research must serve the people and socialism, and have begun to accept the wise and correct educational policy of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness. The vast majority of schools, scientific research institutions, and cultural and educational workers have proposed that they must "combine the four major aspects": the unity of opposites between politics and technology, between theory and practice, between mental labor and physical labor, and between intellectuals and workers and peasants. This is a major gain in the ideological revolution movement of intellectuals, and also a major gain in the possibility of rapid development of cultural education and scientific research in our country. This also proves that the truth recognized by Marxists that "educators themselves must be educated" is great.

However, it should be recognized that reforming ideology is a long-term struggle. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report, "One rectification movement cannot solve all contradictions. To build socialist and communist society, we must not only completely eliminate all old systems of man exploiting man and man oppressing man, but also completely eliminate all old ideas and old habits left in people's minds, produced by this old system, and serving this old system. We must eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, that is, we must finally eliminate all the remnants of the exploiting class and the system of exploitation in people's psychology. This is a much more difficult task than eliminating the exploiting class economically, and it can only be solved through a long and complex process of education and struggle." We cultural and educational workers must clearly understand this truth. If we are determined to serve the general line of socialist construction, then we must continue to break capitalist ideas and establish socialist ideas, break superstitions, value the present over the past, break the traditions of old educational ideas, discard the pseudo-sciences sold by capitalism, and thoroughly clear away all the decadent ideological consciousness of the bourgeoisie and the garbage of other parts of the superstructure on the basis of the "double-anti" movement and in conjunction with studying the general line. That is to say, we cultural and educational workers must consciously continue to transform our thinking, continue to pull out the white flags of the bourgeoisie, insert the red flags of the proletariat, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and temper ourselves to be both red and expert, red and thorough, and become true intellectuals of the working class. Only in this way can we truly wholeheartedly and effectively serve the proletarian socialist cause and promote social productivity.

    文化教育工作者怎样执行总路线？
    若波
    中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这条总路线提出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大的新的革命任务。我们文化教育工作者在这新的历史时期、新的革命任务面前，应当怎样鼓足干劲，力争上游，切实地贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线呢？
    刘少奇同志在“中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告”中指出：“对于科学技术和文化教育工作人员，应当着重地教育他们坚决执行联系实际、联系生产、联系群众的方针，以便有效地为无产阶级的社会主义事业服务，为促进社会生产力的发展服务。”这就是说，文化教育工作者应当为当前的政治、为社会的生产贡献自己的智慧、精力和才能，配合社会主义事业的全面大跃进，以贯彻执行总路线。
    回顾过去，无数的事实说明，在知识界，在我们文化教育工作者队伍里，由于资产阶级思想的浸染，普遍地存在着严重的“为教育而教育”、“管教不管学，教书不教人”等等脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离群众、特别是脱离政治的倾向，以致造成了文化教育事业的严重损失。这次整风运动和反右派斗争以及双反阶段所揭发出来的许许多多事实，还不触目惊心吗？还不叫人深思猛省吗？
    党中央和毛主席经常教导我们，我国是“一穷二白”。“穷”就要多快好省地建设社会主义；“白”就要多快好省地发展文化教育事业，发展科学技术研究，以服务于多快好省的社会主义建设事业。毛主席在“介绍一个合作社”一文中指出，中国六亿人口的“一穷二白”看来是坏事，其实是好事。“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”我们文化教育工作者，不应当在这张“白纸”上写出最旧最丑的文字，画出最旧最丑的画图。在过去，那种厚古薄今、重洋轻中、迷信书本等等的教学、科学研究中的旧传统、伪科学，不是已经在这张白纸上写过最旧最丑的文字、画过最旧最丑的画图了吗？扪心自问，能不愧煞羞煞？
    现在，党指出了要我们文化教育工作者，必须坚决执行这一方针：联系实际，联系生产，联系群众，从而有效地为无产阶级的社会主义事业服务，为促进社会生产力服务。下面，将就这两大服务作一探讨。
    从历史唯物主义的观点看来，一定的文化是反映一定社会的政治和经济的意识形态的。一定的文化教育是为一定的政治和经济服务的。政治是统帅，政治是灵魂。文化教育并不能脱离政治而独立。所谓“为文化而文化”、“为教育而教育”，实际是资产阶级虚伪的欺人之谈。文化教育不是为资产阶级的资本主义服务，就是为无产阶级的社会主义服务，二者必居其一，其它道路是没有的。除了文化教育工作者队伍出了不少右派分子外，为什么在青年学生中出现了不少右派分子或者产生了很多所谓“废品次货”呢？这不能不说是在学校教育中的资产阶级思想所造就的。北大教授唐有祺说：“我们在交给同学很多化学知识的同时，向同学灌输了很多资产阶级观点和思想，助长了同学自高自大和脱离政治的倾向”；这些“没有灵魂的人，对社会主义来说是废品”。资产阶级教学思想教育出来的青年学生，脱离社会主义政治，就必然倾向资产阶级政治，从而在学生中出现了不少右派分子。“为文化而文化”、“为教育而教育”，是资产阶级教学思想的道理也就在此。列宁说过，资产阶级的虚伪表现之一就是相信学校可以脱离政治。而提出这个原理的资产阶级自己就把资产阶级政治放在学校事业的第一位，竭力把学校用来专门替资产阶级训练资本的走卒和奴隶，他们从来不想使学校成为培养人格的工具。
    我们的国家，是社会主义的国家。社会主义国家的政治和经济，一定要有社会主义的文化教育来为它服务。我们说的是无产阶级的真话，不同于资产阶级的谎话。资产阶级的花言巧语掩饰着剥削、压迫、愚弄劳动人民的自私目的，因而把文化教育说成是学者教授的事，把科学研究说成是专家的事，造成了迷信和神秘，造成了高不可攀；而无产阶级的真心诚意，则是为了发展和繁荣祖国的社会主义文化教育和科学技术，配合社会主义经济建设日新月异地前进，好让全国人民享受更幸福美好的物质文化生活。两种思想，两条道路是显而易见的。我们经过了一百多年的革命斗争，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。从这时起，我国就进入了从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。在过渡时期中，我们的政治有敌我矛盾的斗争，也有人民内部矛盾的斗争，我们的文化教育就要为建立在两类矛盾基础上的政治服务，就要为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。抗美援朝时期，我们进行了肃清恐美崇美亲美的思想教育；在社会主义三大改造时期，我们又进行了资本主义道路和社会主义道路的思想斗争；去年以来的政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，我们又开展了“兴无灭资”的思想斗争，直到现在还在继续。这些都说明了无产阶级所需要的文化教育，是服从于无产阶级的政治斗争的。这是客观存在的社会发展规律所“命定”的，真是顺之者昌，逆之者亡。现在，我国的政治，除继续进行经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，以及反对帝国主义保卫祖国外，当前最伟大的政治任务是建设社会主义的经济基础，为贯彻执行“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线”而斗争。这就要求我们的文化教育事业迅速地在党的密切领导下，在总路线的指导下，为培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者进行辛勤艰苦的工作。例如，在学校教育中，应该贯彻执行勤俭办学、勤工俭学的方针，使教学和劳动相结合，以提高教学的质量。这样，才能使文化教育直接地或是间接地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    上面所探讨的，是文化教育要为当前的政治服务、也即要为无产阶级的社会主义事业服务的问题。现在再就文化教育要为促进社会生产力服务的问题作一探讨。
    我们可以想见，党提出了技术革命和文化革命的新的革命任务以后，文化革命的高潮，必将随着技术革命的高潮到来。刘少奇同志的报告中指明：“为了适应技术革命的需要，必须同时进行文化革命，发展为经济建设服务的文化教育卫生事业。”这就是文化革命必然要为技术革命服务。无产阶级要建成社会主义和共产主义，一定要取得全部的科学、技术和知识。从社会主义建设来看，技术革命就是要迅速发展生产力，以最高速度建成一个繁荣富强、幸福美好的伟大的社会主义国家。刘少奇同志的报告中教导我们：“建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。我国经济本来很落后，我国的外部还有帝国主义，只有尽可能地加快建设，才能尽快地巩固我们的社会主义国家，提高人民的生活水平。”因此，我们必须明确认识，我国工业要在十五年或者更短的时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国；我国农业要在提前实现农业发展纲要的基础上，迅速地超过资本主义国家，这就一定要求文化教育的蓬勃发展，以便使我国的科学和技术能够迅速实现“十二年科学发展规划”，赶上世界上最先进的水平，为向地球开战、向大自然进军服务。今年以来，许多群众的改良工具、创造发明，已经开始了工农业生产中的技术革命；各地的扫除文盲、普及小学教育、民办农业中学和各种职业中学以及群众文化活动、科学普及工作、以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动和群众体育活动的开展，等等，已经开始了文化革命。这些文化革命，都是密切结合生产，而又促进了生产的。从历史上看，科学、技术和知识，无一不是由于生产发展和社会斗争的需要而产生、发展、丰富起来的。马克思说过，“在埃及，预先确定尼罗河水涨落的必要，产生了埃及的天文学，跟着又产生了僧侣阶层作为农业指导者所取得的支配权。”越到近代，科学、技术和知识，越因为大工业等的需要而发展起来了。社会主义经济建设的一日千里，日新月异，正处在一个社会生产力空前发展的大跃进时代，文化教育事业，科学、技术和知识，如果不迅速跟上，对社会、对人民还能有什么贡献呢？昆明科学家杜棻说，他所制订的研究血吸虫的规划，至少要一年才能掌握钉螺的产卵期，而许多地方已提出了一年内消灭血吸虫，如果再按原订计划进行研究，连研究的对象也没有了。这不是表明文化教育和科学研究必须迎头赶上，迅速发展，才能跟上万马奔腾的社会生产力发展的需要吗？
    在前一时期中，为什么某些深染资产阶级思想的人，一定要“为文化而文化”，“为教育而教育”呢？他们为什么自己脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离生产，还要教育青年一代也走脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离生产的道路呢？这是不懂得历史发展，还是故意歪曲文化教育在社会上层建筑中的地位和作用呢？经过双反运动对于教育思想的大辩论，揭发和批判了脱离政治、脱离实际的厚古薄今、重洋轻中、重才轻德等的资产阶级教学思想，以及不红不专、只专不红等的个人主义名利思想，不少教授、教师和科学家已经开始猛省过来，承认文化教育和科学研究必须为人民、为社会主义服务，开始接受培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的英明正确的教育方针。绝大多数的学校、科学研究机关和文化教育工作者，提出了一定要“四大结合”：政治和技术、理论和实际，脑力劳动和体力劳动、知识分子和工农这四个对立物的矛盾统一。这是知识分子思想革命运动的重大收获，也是我国文化教育和科学研究有可能迅速发展的重大收获。这也证明了马克思主义者认定的“教育者本人是必须受教育的”真理是伟大的。
    但是，应当认识，改造思想是长期的斗争，正如刘少奇同志报告中指出的，“一次整风运动是不可能解决所有矛盾的。建设社会主义和共产主义社会，不但要彻底消灭人剥削人、人压迫人的一切旧制度，而且要彻底消灭遗留在人们头脑中的、由这种旧制度所产生、为这种旧制度服务的一切旧思想、旧习惯，要灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，也就是说，要在人们的心理上最后地消灭剥削阶级和剥削制度的一切残余。这是比在经济上消灭剥削阶级困难得多的任务，必须经过长期复杂的教育和斗争的过程才能解决。”我们文化教育工作者必须明确理解这一真理。如果我们下定决心，要为社会主义建设总路线服务，那就要在双反运动的基础上，结合学习总路线，继续破资本主义思想，立社会主义思想，破除迷信，厚今薄古，打破旧的教育思想的传统，丢弃资本主义所贩卖的伪科学，彻底扫清资产阶级的一切腐朽的思想意识和上层建筑中的其他部分的垃圾。就是说，我们文化教育工作者一定要自觉地继续改造思想，继续地拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上无产阶级的红旗，深入群众，深入实际，把自己锻炼得又红又专，红透专深，做一个真正的工人阶级的知识分子。这样，才能真正全心全意地有效地为无产阶级的社会主义事业服务，为促进社会生产力服务。
