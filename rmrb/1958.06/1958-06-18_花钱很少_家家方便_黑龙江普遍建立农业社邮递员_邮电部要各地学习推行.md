Spending Little Money, Convenient for Every Household
Heilongjiang Universally Establishes Agricultural Cooperative Postmen
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Calls on All Regions to Learn and Promote

(Our report) Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Committee, the postal and telecommunications departments of Heilongjiang Province have universally implemented the agricultural cooperative postman system. As of now, the province has organized more than 1,590 agricultural cooperative postmen, averaging about one postman for every six agricultural cooperatives.

In recent years, although the postal and telecommunications institutions and communication networks in Heilongjiang Province have been continuously expanding, the vast number of farmers and rural cadres still have to travel long distances to postal and telecommunications institutions to mail letters, remit money, mail parcels, and subscribe to newspapers and periodicals. Letters, remittances, parcels, newspapers, and periodicals sent to rural areas from other places cannot be delivered to households. Official letters and documents between townships and cooperatives also require temporary dispatching of workers on business trips.

After the implementation of the agricultural cooperative postman system, the above problems have been basically solved. The so-called agricultural cooperative postman system is to set up a postman in a township or several agricultural production cooperatives, responsible for delivering mail and newspapers and periodicals below the township and cooperative level, and for delivering official letters between townships and cooperatives free of charge; the postman's remuneration is paid by the agricultural cooperative by means of work points, and the post office also pays a certain amount of remuneration according to the amount of stamps and newspapers and periodicals sold by the postman. After the implementation of the agricultural cooperative postman system, although farmers have increased a little economic burden, the cost is minimal, averaging only two jiao and six fen per household per year, in exchange for unlimited convenience. After Baiquan County implemented the agricultural cooperative postman system, 41 cooperative postmen delivered more than 70,000 letters for farmers, wrote more than 5,000 letters on their behalf, mailed more than 550 parcels, handled more than 500 remittances, and sent more than 20 telegrams in one year. Without cooperative postmen, it would require 17,175 farmer workdays to send and receive so many letters and parcels.

The agricultural cooperative postman system facilitates the communication needs of the broad masses and also saves a lot of expenses for the country. According to the Heilongjiang Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, if the mail and newspapers and periodicals below the township and cooperative level in the province were to be delivered by personnel from postal and telecommunications institutions, in order to reach the current service level of agricultural cooperative postmen, the province would have to add 1,379 people. Calculated at a salary of only 574 yuan per person per year, the state would have to spend more than 790,000 yuan more each year.

(Our report) A person in charge of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications gave a talk to our reporter on the implementation of the agricultural cooperative postman system.

The person in charge said: With the continuous development of the upsurge in agricultural production, the upsurge in running local industries, and the upsurge in culture in our country, and with the large number of cadres going to the countryside and mountains to train, the needs of the broad masses of rural people for using postal and telecommunications and subscribing to newspapers and periodicals are rapidly increasing. How to speed up postal and telecommunications work to adapt to this new situation is a very important issue. At present, the communication forces in our rural areas are still very weak, and mail and newspapers and periodicals below the township and cooperative level cannot be directly delivered to households. If we want to change this situation, it is estimated that the country will have to add more than 100,000 postal and telecommunications workers, and the annual expenditure will increase by more than 50 million yuan. This does not conform to the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift. The person in charge said that the agricultural cooperative postman system implemented in Heilongjiang Province is the best organizational form to combine the strength of the state and the strength of the masses to solve the rural communication problem. After the implementation of this system, the burden on farmers is not large, but mail and newspapers and periodicals can be directly delivered to users, and the problem of delays and loss of mail and newspapers and periodicals that occurred in the past due to entrusting others to forward them can be fundamentally solved. Postal and telecommunications administrations in all provinces and regions can request instructions from the local Party committee and the People's Committee and implement this system according to the specific conditions of the area.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications also believes that the following issues should be paid attention to when implementing the agricultural cooperative postman system: (1) This work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Committee, so that townships and cooperatives are willing and members agree; (2) The setting and service scope of cooperative postmen should be determined according to the size of the agricultural cooperative and the regional distribution. In principle, one postman can be set up for one township or several agricultural cooperatives, or one postman can be set up separately for one agricultural cooperative. The general requirement is: to take into account both the delivery capacity of the postman and to consider saving labor; (3) The candidates for cooperative postmen do not need to be too demanding, as long as they are politically pure, healthy, and have a little education; (4) The remuneration of cooperative postmen can be solved by the agricultural cooperative by means of work points, and postal and telecommunications institutions should also pay remuneration according to the amount of stamps and newspapers and periodicals sold by the postman. The handling of the remuneration is determined by the township and cooperative themselves; (5) When setting up agricultural cooperative postmen, local postal and telecommunications institutions and agricultural cooperatives should sign contracts and agree on the responsibilities and obligations of both parties. It should be made clear that cooperative postmen are still organizational members of the agricultural cooperative and are assigned by the cooperative to serve the communication work below the township and cooperative level. Agricultural cooperatives should conduct regular education for postmen and supervise their work, and postal and telecommunications institutions should provide guidance in communication business.

### 花钱很少　家家方便  黑龙江普遍建立农业社邮递员  邮电部要各地学习推行

    花钱很少　家家方便
    黑龙江普遍建立农业社邮递员
    邮电部要各地学习推行
    本报讯　黑龙江省邮电部门在当地党委和人民委员会的统一领导下，普遍推行了农业社邮递员制度，截至目前为止，全省已组织了农业社邮递员一千五百九十余名，约平均六个农业社就有一名邮递员。
    几年来黑龙江省的邮电机构和通信网路虽然不断扩大，但广大农民和农村干部寄信、汇款和邮寄包裹、订阅报刊等，都要远程跑到邮电机构办理。外地寄给农村的信件、汇款和包裹、报刊等，不能投递到户。乡社间因公互送信函、文件，也要临时派工出差。
    实行农业社邮递员制度以后，基本上解决了以上的问题。所谓农业社邮递员制度，就是在一个乡或几个农业生产合作社设置一个邮递员，负责投递乡、社以下的邮件和报刊，并免费寄递乡社之间的公函；邮递员的劳动报酬由农业社以计工分的办法付给，邮电局并根据邮递员出售邮票和报刊的多少，付给一定的酬金。实行农业社邮递员制度以后，农民虽然增加了一点经济负担，但所费无几，平均每户每年只负担二角六分钱，换来的却是无限的方便。拜泉县在推行农业社邮递员制度以后，四十一名社邮递员在一年内即为农民寄递信件七万余封，代笔写信五千余封，邮寄包裹五百五十余件，办理汇款五百余次，电报二十余份。如果没有社邮递员，寄取这样多的信件和包裹等，共需一万七千一百七十五个农民的劳动日。
    农业社邮递员制度，便利了广大群众的通信需要，也为国家节省了大量开支。据黑龙江省邮电管理局计算，全省乡、社以下的邮件和报刊如由邮电机构的人员负责投送，要达到农业社邮递员现在的服务水平，全省就得增加一千三百七十九人。每人每年仅以五百七十四元的工资计算，国家每年就要多开支七十九万余元。
    本报讯　邮电部负责人就推行农业社邮递员制度，向本报记者发表谈话。
    负责人说：随着我国农业生产高潮、兴办地方工业高潮和文化高潮的不断发展，随着大批干部下乡上山锻炼，广大农村人民使用邮电通信和订阅报刊的需要迅速增加。邮电通信工作如何快马加鞭，适应这种新的形势，是一个十分重要的问题。目前，我国农村通信力量还十分薄弱，乡、社以下的邮件和报刊都不能直接投递到户。如果要改变这种情况，估计全国要增加十万多邮电职工，每年要增加五千多万元开支。这是不符合勤俭建国的方针的。负责人说，黑龙江省推行的农业社邮递员制度，是把国家力量和群众力量结合起来，解决农村通信问题的最好的组织形式。这个制度推行以后，农民的负担不大，邮件和报刊却可以直接送到用户手中，过去托人捎转中稽延、丢失邮件和报刊的问题，可以从根本上解决。各个省、区邮电管理局，都可以请示当地党委和人民委员会，根据当地的具体情况推行这个制度。
    邮电部负责人还认为，在推行农业社邮递员制度时应该注意以下的问题：（一）必须在当地党委和人民委员会的统一领导下进行这一工作，做到乡、社自愿，社员同意；（二）社邮递员的设置和服务范围，应该根据农业社的规模大小和地区分布情况决定。原则上可以一个乡或几个农业社合设一名邮递员，也可以一个农业社单独设置一名邮递员。总的要求是：既要照顾到邮递员的投递能力，又要考虑到节省劳动力；（三）社邮递员的人选，不必要求太高，只要政治上纯洁，身体健康，稍有文化水平即可；（四）社邮递员的劳动报酬，可由农业社以记工分的办法解决，邮电机构也应该根据邮递员出售邮票和报刊多少付给酬金。酬金的处理由乡、社自行决定；（五）在设置农业社邮递员时，当地邮电机构和农业社应该订立合同，商定双方的责任和义务。应当明确：社邮递员仍为农业社的组织成员，是受社的指派为乡、社以下的通信工作服务的。农业社应对邮递员经常进行教育，监督其工作，邮电机构在通信业务上给予指导。
