　　A Major Reform of the Labor System
　　Wang Pu
    Shanxi Province has universally established a reserve worker system in agricultural cooperatives to support industry, and Chongqing City has universally implemented a relatively fixed labor contract system when recruiting new workers in newly built factories. These practices are a significant creation in the labor system. It has many benefits: first, it guarantees the labor force needed for industrial development; and when production changes and workers need to be reduced, it does not lead to idle labor and waste; such workers do not need to bring their families to the factory, so the factory's non-productive construction investment can be greatly reduced. On the agricultural cooperative side, it can uniformly arrange the labor force, supporting industry without affecting agriculture; moreover, it can take this opportunity to train a large number of skilled farmers, promote the technical reform of agriculture; and it can help cooperative members learn the excellent qualities of the working class and improve the political consciousness of farmers.
    This approach is in line with the general line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in building socialism. Small factories below the county level and large factories above the county level can consider trying this method. After the completion of the Chongqing Sanjiang Steel Plant, it will need more than 2,000 workers, and about 70% will be contract workers. Such a large factory can do this, which shows that factories run by special districts and counties can do it even more. As for mines and construction enterprises, which use the largest number of ordinary workers and temporary workers, it is even more appropriate to adopt this method.
    The implementation of this method has even more far-reaching political significance. It can enhance mutual understanding between workers and peasants, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and accelerate the process of eliminating the differences between workers and peasants. In the new system implemented in Shanxi and Chongqing, there are sprouts of communism. New types of workers and new types of worker-peasant relations will be produced and developed under this new system.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "With the improvement of the management system, with the leap forward in production and construction, and with the improvement of mass consciousness, it is necessary to seriously and systematically improve the existing rules and regulations on economic work and other work." The report specifically pointed out: "Improving labor organization and labor management, and changing some unreasonable rules and regulations in this regard, is one of the important issues that must be addressed at present." The methods adopted by Shanxi and Chongqing are a major reform in the labor system based on this spirit. We hope that other places will also study and analyze the local situation based on this spirit, promote the experience of Shanxi and Chongqing in light of local conditions, and create more and better methods.

　　劳动制度的重大改革
　　王朴
    山西省在农业社里普遍建立了支援工业的预备工制度，重庆市新建工厂在招收新工人的时候，普遍实行了相对固定的劳动合同制度。这些做法，是劳动制度上一件有重大意义的创造。它的好处很多：首先是工业发展需要增加的劳动力有了保证；而生产有变动，需要减少工人时，又不致造成窝工浪费；这样的工人不必带家属进厂，因此工厂的非生产性建设投资可以大大减少。在农业社方面，则可以统一安排劳动力，既支援了工业，又不致影响农业；而且，还可以趁此培养出大批有技术的农民，促进农业的技术改革；可以帮助社员们学习工人阶级的优秀品质，提高农民的政治觉悟。
    这种做法符合多快好省的建设方针。县以下的小工厂和县以上的大工厂，都可以考虑试行这种办法。重庆三江钢铁厂完工后需要二千多名工人，70％左右都将采用合同工，这样大的厂可以这样办，可见专区和县办的工厂更可以这样办。至于用普通工、临时工数量最大的矿山和建筑企业，采用这种办法就更合适。
    实行这种办法，还有更为深远的政治意义。它可以增进工人和农民之间的相互了解，进一步巩固工农联盟，加速消除工农差别的过程。在山西和重庆所实行的这个新制度里面，蕴育着共产主义的幼芽，新型的劳动者，新型的工农关系，将在这种新制度下产生和发展起来。
    中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中指出：“随着管理体制的改进，随着生产建设事业的跃进和群众觉悟的提高，必须认真地、有系统地改进现行的关于经济工作以及其他工作的各种规章制度。”报告中特别指出：“改善劳动组织和劳动管理，改变这方面的某些不合理的规章制度，是当前必须注意解决的重要问题之一。”山西和重庆所采取的办法，正是根据这个精神在劳动制度上进行的一项重大改革。我们希望别的地方也根据这个精神，研究、分析当地的情况，因地制宜地推行山西和重庆的经验，并且创造出更多更好的办法来。
