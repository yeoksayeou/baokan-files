Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Duclos, when interviewed by a reporter from the London "Daily Worker," said, "In France, there exist social and political forces sufficient to block the path of fascism and prevent the exercise of individual power."

The interview, published today in the "Daily Worker," quoted Duclos as saying that the formation of the de Gaulle government possesses only a legal facade. In reality, it is the product of the military coup in Algiers and Ayazo, as well as the shameful surrender of the Pflimlin government and the betrayal of Socialist Party General Secretary Mollet. Mollet has become a tool of de Gaulle's personal power.

Duclos pointed out that for the working class and the French people, the establishment of the de Gaulle government marks the beginning of a new stage in the struggle to defend the Republic.

He said that de Gaulle's ministers are all his personal servants. De Gaulle, surrounded by these servants, poses an even greater threat to the republican system because he also possesses the power to amend the constitution. He will draft a constitutional draft aimed at giving his personal power constitutional form.

Duclos pointed out that the de Gaulle supporters want to use the so-called Committees of Public Safety to carry out a fascist movement. This movement, in attacking political and trade union freedoms, will be required to play a role somewhat like that played by the Falange in Franco's Spain. Since there is no large-scale de Gaulle movement in France, the prime minister general wants to create one. Duclos pointed out that the (so-called public safety) committees being established everywhere and in factories are being established according to Mussolini's fascist methods.

As de Gaulle's speech in Algiers has just shown, the new government has revealed its true colors. It is the product of the most reactionary and colonialist big capital forces demanding the continuation of the war in Algeria. The continuation of the war in Algeria is against the true interests of France and carries the grave danger of expanding the war to the entire North Africa.

Duclos emphasized that the French Communist Party fully recognizes its responsibilities. It has timely alerted the working class and the people of the whole country, thereby creating the conditions for mobilizing the people to defend the Republic. The efforts of the French Communist Party have made it impossible for the fascist conspiracy to be realized as they had originally planned. Now the French Communist Party's call to the whole country is: establish thousands of Republic Defense Committees in factories, cities and rural areas, and intensify the struggle for peace in Algeria, for meeting the demands of the working people, and for easing international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 7th: An anti-fascist mass rally was held in Lyon, attended by three thousand people.

French Communist Party Central Committee member and National Assembly member Jean Garin, speaking at the rally, pointed out that the Lyon "Committee of Public Safety," which recently moved from secret to public activity, is plotting a fascist conspiracy.

Jean Garin said, "Lyon, which was once one of the centers of the Resistance movement, will never become the first fascist city in France." He called on the republicans of Lyon to be vigilant and to establish anti-fascist committees in all enterprises.

National Assembly members Pierre Cot and Camille Vallin also spoke at the rally.

According to newspaper reports, the Montbéliard Anti-Fascist Committee, attended by representatives of thirty-five political groups and trade union organizations, passed a resolution. The resolution stated that the committee "will maintain its unity and will resolutely counter any conspiracy that infringes on democratic freedoms." (Attached picture)

### 杜克洛对伦敦“工人日报”记者说  法国人民能够制止个人独裁  里昂举行反法西斯群众大会

    杜克洛对伦敦“工人日报”记者说
    法国人民能够制止个人独裁
    里昂举行反法西斯群众大会
    新华社伦敦7日电　法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛在接见伦敦“工人日报”记者时说，“在法国存在着足以堵塞法西斯道路和制止行使个人权力的社会和政治力量。”
    今天“工人日报”登载的这个访问记援引杜克洛的话说，戴高乐政府的组成仅仅具有合法的外貌。它实际上是阿尔及尔和阿耶佐军事政变的产物，同时也是弗林姆兰政府的可耻的投降和社会党总书记摩勒叛卖的结果。摩勒已经变成了戴高乐个人权力的工具。
    杜克洛指出，对工人阶级和法国人民来说，戴高乐政府的成立意味着保卫共和国的斗争的新阶段的开始。
    他说，戴高乐的部长们都是他个人的仆从，周围有这些仆从的戴高乐，对于共和国制度的威胁更大，因为他还拥有修改宪法的权力，他将拟定旨在给予他个人权力以宪法形式的宪法草案。
    杜克洛指出，戴高乐分子想利用所谓救国委员会来搞一个法西斯性质的运动。这种运动在攻击政治自由和工会自由这一点上，将被要求来发挥多少像长枪党在佛朗哥西班牙所发挥的作用。由于在法国并没有大规模的戴高乐运动，这位总理将军就想搞一个。杜克洛指出，正在各地和工厂正在努力建立的（所谓救国）委员会，是按照墨索里尼的法西斯办法建立的。
    正如戴高乐在阿尔及尔的演说刚刚表明的那样，新政府显示了它的本色，它是要求在阿尔及利亚继续进行战争的最反动的和最富有殖民主义性质的大资本势力的产物，而在阿尔及利亚继续进行战争是违反法国真正的利益的，并且带有把战争扩大到整个北非的严重危险。
    杜克洛强调指出，法国共产党充分认识到自己所肩负的责任，它已经及时地使得工人阶级和全国人民警惕起来，从而创造了让人民动员起来保卫共和国的条件。法国共产党的努力已经使得法西斯阴谋无法像他们原来计划的那样实现。现在法国共产党向全国发出的号召是：在工厂、城市和农村成立成千上万的共和国保卫委员会，加紧进行争取阿尔及利亚的和平、争取满足劳动人民的要求和争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社巴黎7日讯：里昂举行了有三千人参加的反法西斯群众大会。
    法国共产党中央委员、国民议会议员让·加?在大会上讲话时指出，不久前由秘密转为公开活动的里昂“救国委员会”正在策划法西斯阴谋。
    让·加?说，“过去曾是抵抗运动中心之一的里昂永远不会变成法国的第一座法西斯城市”。他号召里昂的共和人士提高警惕，在所有的企业中成立反法西斯委员会。
    国民议会议员皮埃尔·戈特和加米耶·瓦兰也在大会上讲了话。
    据报纸报道，有三十五个政治团体和工会组织代表参加的蒙拜利埃市反法西斯委员会通过了一项决议。决议说，委员会“将维护它的团结，并将给予任何侵犯民主自由的阴谋以坚决反击”。（附图片）
