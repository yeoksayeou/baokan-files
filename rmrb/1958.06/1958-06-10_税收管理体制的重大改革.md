A major reform of the tax management system

The "Regulations of the State Council on Improving the Tax Management System," which have been approved by the 97th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and are announced today, represent a major reform in China's tax management system. These regulations are based on the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. They correctly address the issue of combining centralism with local autonomy. Therefore, their promulgation and trial implementation will further unleash the initiative of local authorities and the masses, and will be conducive to promoting a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Taxation is a primary means by which the state mobilizes socialist accumulation funds, and it is also a way for the state to distribute the wealth created by the people. If this distribution is carried out appropriately, it can promote the development of production; conversely, it will hinder the development of production. The original tax management system was basically formed gradually during the period of national economic recovery and before the basic completion of socialist transformation. At that time, in order to meet the needs of finance and economy, and in order to cooperate with the state's need to transform capitalist industry and commerce, it was proven entirely necessary to implement a greater degree of centralization in tax management. However, with the basic completion of socialist transformation and the rapid development of socialist construction, the original tax management system became incompatible with the development of the current political and economic situation. In particular, it is far from being able to adapt to the current situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and therefore it must be rapidly improved.

Where does the contradiction between the original tax management system and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production mainly manifest itself? In terms of industrial production, for example, with the surge in industrial production, the trial production of new products and the entry into production of newly built enterprises, their profit and loss situations in the early stages of trial production and production are different, and the degree of state support required is also different. This requires differentiating the different situations of enterprises and making appropriate provisions for tax payment, tax reduction, or tax exemption. Cooperative production between industrial enterprises is beneficial to fully utilizing the efficiency of existing equipment in enterprises and saving investment in capital construction. However, the situations and methods of cooperative production are diverse. It is inappropriate to uniformly provide for either across-the-board support or across-the-board non-support in taxation. Only by authorizing local authorities to specifically control this can the role of encouraging cooperative production be achieved. In terms of agricultural production, for example, due to the differences in natural conditions and economic conditions in various regions, the production and management situations are also very complex. Often, sometimes taxes should be levied, and sometimes support is needed; taxes should be levied here, and support is needed there; taxes should be levied on this product, and support is needed on that product, etc. Only by authorizing local authorities to adapt to local conditions and act according to the times can tax work better promote and regulate the normal development of agricultural and sideline production. Therefore, in order to carry out tax work correctly and in a timely and locally appropriate manner, and in the context of improvements already made to the state's financial management system and industrial and commercial management system, it is also necessary to make corresponding improvements to the state's tax management system.

The new tax management system stipulates that all taxes that can be managed by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be handed over to them for management; for the few taxes that are still managed by the central government, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government are given the power to make flexible adjustments within a certain range; and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government are allowed to formulate tax measures and levy local taxes. In this way, it is conducive to the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, under the unified leadership of the central government, to use the tool of taxation in a timely and appropriate manner during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and to take necessary measures of encouragement and restriction to promote the normal development of production and consolidate the socialist economy, based on the actual conditions of the locality. Moreover, on the basis of production development, to open up financial resources, increase accumulation, and further expand reproduction. It can be seen from this that the promulgation and trial implementation of the new tax management system is completely timely and necessary.

The purpose of improving the tax management system is to enable tax work to play a better role in developing production, prospering the economy, increasing national capital accumulation, and consolidating the socialist economic system. Therefore, when implementing the new tax management system, it is necessary to correctly understand and resolutely implement the Party and government's principles and policies in these areas. Ignoring any aspect or a one-sided understanding of any aspect is incorrect. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Both the state-owned economy and the collective economy should appropriately increase the proportion of accumulation in the national income in order to carry out socialist construction more and faster. The state's policies on wages, subsidies, welfare, bonuses, prices, taxes, and profits must reasonably take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." In order to promote the development of production, it is necessary to appropriately adopt some tax reduction and tax exemption measures under certain conditions, but this must be premised on not affecting the state's budgetary revenue; for some enterprises that have losses after paying taxes in accordance with the tax law, tax support can be given within a certain period, but attention must be paid to ensure that this support does not become an encouragement for backwardness. In short, when implementing the new tax management system, there should be an overall view, and the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and the relationship between production, accumulation, and transformation should be taken into account.

The decentralization of tax management authority is premised on the general line of socialist construction determined by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Whether local authorities adopt measures to reduce taxes, exempt taxes, increase taxes, or levy local taxes, it is all in order to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction. In addition, the State Council's regulations also stipulate the matters that local authorities should pay attention to when implementing the new tax management system. As long as local authorities proceed from the general line of socialist construction and act in accordance with the matters stipulated by the State Council, it is certain that the work will be done better than in the past after the decentralization of tax management authority.

The decentralization of tax management authority is also a decentralization of responsibility. We hope that local Party committees and people's committees at all levels will further strengthen their leadership over tax work in the future. Local tax authorities should conscientiously study and improve their work based on the situation after the trial implementation of the new regulations. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, they should further unleash the wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. In this way, tax work can meet the needs of the development of productive forces and become a powerful tool for promoting the development of productive forces, thereby better serving the general line of socialist construction.

### 税收管理体制的重大改革

　　税收管理体制的重大改革
    今天公布的已经经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十七次会议批准的“国务院关于改进税收管理体制的规定”，是我国税收管理体制上的一项重大改革。这个规定是根据鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的要求，正确地解决了中央集权与地方分权相结合的问题，因而它的公布试行，必将进一步发挥地方的和群众的积极性，有利于促进工农业生产大跃进。
    税收是国家动员社会主义资金积累的一种主要方式，也是国家对于人民所创造的财富的一种分配方式。这种分配进行的适当，可以促进生产的发展；反之，就会妨碍生产的发展。原来的税收管理体制，基本上是在国民经济恢复时期和社会主义改造基本完成以前逐步形成起来的。在当时，为了适应财政上和经济上的需要，为了配合国家对资本主义工商业改造的需要，在税收管理上实行较大程度上的集中，事实证明是完全必要的。但是，随着社会主义改造的基本完成和社会主义建设的迅速发展，原来的税收管理体制同当前的政治形势和经济形势的发展就不相适应了。特别是远远不能同当前工农业生产大跃进的形势相适应，因而必须迅速地加以改进。
    原来的税收管理体制同工农业生产大跃进形势不相适应的矛盾，主要表现在哪里呢？在工业生产方面，例如随着工业生产高潮而来的新产品的试制和新建企业投入生产，由于它们在试制和生产初期盈亏情况各不相同，需要国家照顾的程度也不相同，这就需要区别企业的不同情况，作出恰当的征税、减税或者免税的规定；工业企业之间的协作生产，对于充分发挥企业现有设备的效能和节约基本建设投资等都有好处，而协作生产的情况和协作的方式多种多样，在税收上笼统地规定一律照顾或者一律不照顾，都是不妥当的，只有授权地方具体掌握，才能起到鼓励协作生产的作用。在农业生产方面，例如由于各地自然条件、经济条件不同，生产和经营的情况也很复杂，往往有时应当征税，有时又需要照顾；在这里应当征税，在那里又需要照顾；对这种产品应当征税，对那种产品又需要照顾，等等，只有授权地方因时因地制宜，才能使税收工作更好地促进和调节农副业生产的正常发展。因此，为了正确地、因时因地制宜地进行税收工作，在国家的财政管理体制和工业、商业管理体制已经作了改进的情况下，国家的税收管理体制，也有必要作相应的改进。
    新的税收管理体制规定，凡是可以由省、自治区、直辖市负责管理的税收，应当交给省、自治区、直辖市管理；若干仍然由中央管理的税收，在一定范围内，给省、自治区、直辖市以机动调整的权限；并且允许省、自治区、直辖市制定税收办法，开征地区性的税收。这样，就有利于各省、自治区、直辖市在中央的统一领导下，在工农业生产大跃进的过程中，根据当地的实际情况，及时地、恰当地运用税收这一工具，采取必要的鼓励和限制的措施，促进生产的正常发展，巩固社会主义经济。并且在生产发展的基础上，开辟财源，增加积累，以进一步扩大再生产。由此可见，新的税收管理体制的公布试行，是完全适时的、必要的。
    改进税收管理体制的目的，就是为了使税收工作能够在发展生产、繁荣经济、增加国家资金积累和巩固社会主义经济制度等方面更好地发挥作用。因此，在贯彻执行新的税收管理体制的时候，就必须正确认识并坚决执行党和政府关于这些方面的方针和政策，忽视任何方面或者对于任何方面的片面理解都是不正确的。刘少奇同志在中共中央向八大第二次会议的工作报告中指出：“无论国营经济和集体经济，都应当适当地提高积累在国民收入中的比重，以便更多更快地进行社会主义建设。国家关于工资、补贴、福利、奖金、价格、税收和利润等方面的政策，都必须合理地兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面的利益。”为了促进生产的发展，在一定的条件下，适当地采取一些减税、免税的措施是必要的，但它必须以不影响国家预算的收入为前提；对于某些按照税法规定纳税以后有亏损的企业，可以在一定时期内在税收上给以照顾，但是必须注意不能使这种照顾变成鼓励落后。总之，在贯彻执行新的税收管理体制的时候，应当有全局观点，应当兼顾到国家、集体、个人三方面的利益和生产、积累、改造各方面的关系。
    税收管理权限的下放，是以党的八大第二次会议确定的社会主义建设总路线为前提的，各地无论采取减税、免税、加税或者开征地区性的税收的措施，都是为了贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线。此外，国务院的规定中还规定了各地执行新的税收管理体制的时候应注意的事项，各地只要从社会主义建设总路线出发并且按照国务院规定的注意事项办事，可以肯定，在税收管理权限下放以后，工作一定比过去做得更好。
    税收管理权限下放，同时也是责任下放，我们希望各级地方党委和人民委员会，今后更要加强对税收工作的领导。各地税务主管部门要根据新规定试行后的情况，认真研究和改进自己的工作，在党和政府的领导下，进一步发挥群众的智慧和革命积极性，这样，税收工作就可以适合生产力发展的需要，并成为促进生产力发展的有力工具，从而更好地为社会主义建设总路线服务。
