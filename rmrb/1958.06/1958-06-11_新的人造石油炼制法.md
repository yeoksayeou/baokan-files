    New artificial petroleum refining methods
    There are three methods for refining artificial petroleum: extracting oil by dry distillation of coal or oil shale; extracting oil by chemically synthesizing gases containing hydrocarbons through catalysts; and extracting oil by high-pressure hydrogenation of coal or heavy oil.
    "Medium-Pressure Iron-Based Fluidized Bed Water Gas to Synthetic Petroleum" uses the second method. Water gas is composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, while petroleum is a hydrocarbon compound, so water gas can be used to convert it into petroleum through a catalyst. Currently, cobalt is generally used as a catalyst in China. However, it has two disadvantages: first, the gas is under normal pressure during the refining process, so the equipment is large and consumes a lot of steel; second, cobalt is a rare metal with limited sources. The Beijing Coal-to-Oil Demonstration Plant under construction will use molten iron as a catalyst, and the refining process will require 25 atmospheres of pressure (i.e., medium pressure), which will reduce the steel consumption of the equipment.

    新的人造石油炼制法
    炼制人造石油有三种办法：将煤或油母页岩经过干馏取油；用含有碳氢的气体经过催化剂化学合成的办法取油；用煤或重质油通过高压加氢的办法取油。
    “中压铁剂流化床水煤气合成石油”，即是采用第二种办法。水煤气是由一氧化碳和氢气组成的，而石油是碳氢化合物，所以可以利用水煤气通过催化剂使它转变为石油。目前，国内一般都用钴作为催化剂。但是它有两个缺点：一、炼制过程中，气体在常压情况下，因此设备的体积大，消耗的钢材多；二、钴是稀有金属，来源较少。筹建中的北京煤炼油示范厂将用溶铁作为催化剂，并且炼制过程中需用二十五个大气压力（即中压），这样设备的钢材消耗也较少。
