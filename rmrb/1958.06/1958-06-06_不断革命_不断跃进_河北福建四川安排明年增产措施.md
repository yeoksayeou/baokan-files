    Continuous Revolution, Continuous Great Leap Forward
    Hebei, Fujian, and Sichuan Arrange Measures for Next Year's Increased Production
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 5th) Reporter Zhang Hua reports: Hebei Province, at a recent provincial on-site conference on agricultural technology revolution, summarized this year's wheat field management experience. It was decided to break superstitions, universally promote ten technical measures, vigorously carry out technical reforms, guarantee a bumper wheat harvest next year, and change the face of wheat production in Hebei Province in one year.
    The ten wheat field yield-increasing technical measures promoted by Hebei Province were formulated based on the spirit of emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions. The basic starting points for formulating these technical measures are: breaking the past management methods of single measures, concentrating the yield-increasing factors of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, etc., and comprehensively guaranteeing increased yield in wheat fields; boldly applying the experience of typical high-yield production created by the masses in recent years, universally promoting the many large-area high-yield experiences that have emerged this year, and comprehensively improving the cultivation technology of wheat fields throughout the province; continuing to promote the perseverance of "man can conquer nature," promoting the experience of overcoming severe drought this year and striving for a bumper wheat harvest, conquering nature, preventing disasters and ensuring harvest, and ensuring increased production.
    These ten technical measures include the following main contents: 1. Continue to build water conservancy projects so that all wheat fields next year can be irrigated and drained, ensuring stable yields despite drought or flood. 2. Immediately launch a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign to ensure that each mu of wheat field is applied with 20,000 jin of good-quality coarse fertilizer. Counties, townships, and cooperatives with conditions should also universally build chemical fertilizer plants to produce chemical fertilizers in preparation for topdressing wheat fields. 3. Universally deep-plow and deep-turn wheat fields by about one foot before sowing to improve the soil of wheat fields. 4. Universally replace wheat fields with superior varieties next year. 5. Prepare land, seeds, and fertilizers early, and sow in a timely and early manner. 6. Vigorously promote wide-row close planting with wide sowing widths, ensuring 500,000 effective ears per mu, creating conditions for large-area intercropping. 7. Irrigate five times and topdress three times, grasping the five key links of overwintering, greening, and booting, and timely irrigating and topdressing. 8. Timely cultivate, weed, and conserve soil moisture. 9. Prevent and control all diseases, insect pests, and rodents. Universally soak seeds, treat seeds with pesticides, and apply poisonous baits to prevent underground pests during autumn sowing, and prepare pesticides and machinery now. 10. Harvest and thresh in a timely manner, and carefully thresh and collect.
    The meeting believed that universally promoting the above measures throughout the province, changing wheat planting techniques, can rapidly increase wheat production in Hebei Province next year, change the face of wheat production, and promote a great leap forward in grain production throughout the province. Promoting the above technical measures can shift the large area of winter wheat planting from the current area south of Shijiazhuang and Baoding to the area north of Baoding and Tianjin (except for the Bashang area), changing these new wheat areas from the current large-scale single cropping of miscellaneous grains to large-scale grain-wheat intercropping, changing from one crop a year to three crops in two years. The miscellaneous grain areas in central Hebei and the coastal paddy fields can also use these techniques to implement grain-wheat intercropping and wheat-rice rotation, changing from one crop a year to three crops in two years or two crops a year. In cotton-producing areas, using these techniques to intercrop wheat and other early-maturing crops in cotton ridges can also achieve both cotton and wheat harvests. According to Hebei Province's existing experience, comprehensively implementing the ten wheat yield-increasing techniques, especially water, fertilizer, soil, improved varieties, close planting, and other technologies, and realizing the garden-like cultivation of wheat fields, the per-mu yield of general wheat fields will be greatly increased. According to the meeting's prediction, after Hebei Province boldly adopts the above ten measures to ensure the realization of next year's wheat production increase plan, next year's summer harvest yield will be greatly increased.
    Hebei Province planted more than 27 million mu of winter wheat this year, in addition to more than 14 million mu of spring wheat and other early-maturing crops. Now, the wheat in the Weiyun River, Fuyang River, and Hutuo River basins, several major wheat-producing areas in the province, is gradually turning yellow and ripening. According to preliminary yield estimates, a bumper wheat harvest throughout the province is a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, several counties such as Anguo and Zhengding have emerged with a per-mu yield of 400 jin, and many large-area high-yield models with per-mu yields of 500 jin, 800 jin, and 1,000 jin, breaking the old rule that wheat yields have never been high. Therefore, this meeting regarded breaking superstitions and improving wheat yield-increasing techniques as an important topic for research. During the meeting, leading cadres from the provincial to county levels went to large-area high-yield wheat fields in Anguo, Zhengding, and other places to visit and receive education, reversing the superstitious idea that wheat cannot be significantly increased in yield. Many people, after seeing the high-yield wheat planted on sweet potato stubble, changed their original superstitious idea that wheat fields could not be expanded due to the inability to rotate crops. Encouraged by the large-area high-yield wheat fields, people are determined to strive for an even greater harvest next year.
    (Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 5th) The Rural Work Conference held by the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China from May 26th to June 2nd, after carefully studying the general line of socialist construction, decided to further accelerate the development of agricultural production, strive for a greater leap forward next year, and win a larger area of bumper harvest. The meeting also decided to start preparing for production this winter and next spring from now on.
    Fujian Province's agricultural production has already begun to show a scene of great harvest this year. Spring harvested crops such as rapeseed and overwintering sweet potatoes have achieved unprecedented harvests. Over 10 million mu of early rice, peanuts, and other summer harvested crops throughout the province are growing unprecedentedly well. As long as we continue to pay attention to overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas and overcome some natural disasters that may occur, it is entirely possible to complete or exceed the leap forward plan of producing 11 billion jin of grain this year.
    Based on this year's experience and prior in-depth investigation and research, the meeting formulated seven measures to ensure a greater leap forward in agriculture next year.
    First, persistently and enthusiastically carry out mass technical revolution movements centered on agricultural tool reform in combination with each production season. Second, launch a province-wide mass movement of deep-digging fields and improving soil to transform arable land around the beginning of this winter sowing. Third, launch a fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement on a larger scale than this year. Every township and cooperative should establish fertilizer plants according to local conditions; provincial industrial departments should focus on establishing larger chemical fertilizer plants and bacterial fertilizer plants; and according to mineral deposits and seaweed fertilizer conditions, every county should establish an ammonium sulfate plant, granular fertilizer plant, and seaweed fertilizer manufacturing plant, etc. Fourth, further improve water conservancy facilities and realize systematized irrigation. Fifth, popularize improved varieties and institutionalize the seed retention field system of agricultural cooperatives, and comprehensively implement the seed work policy of "seeds self-bred, self-selected, self-retained, self-used, supplemented by regulation." All crops that have not adopted improved varieties must be replaced with local improved varieties next year. Sixth, vigorously prevent and control diseases, insect pests, birds, beasts, and disasters. Seventh, continue to implement the cultivation technology reform movement centered on early transplanting and close planting.
    In order to ensure the realization of these yield-increasing measures, the meeting requested that leaders at all levels and relevant departments in the province start preparing the following tasks as early as possible: First, each county should prepare for winter sowing seeds from now on, determine this year's winter sowing arrangements and next year's production plan before the summer harvest, and disseminate them to townships and cooperatives. After the summer harvest and summer planting, each township and cooperative should immediately carry out various material preparations for winter plowing and winter sowing while doing a good job in the autumn harvest. Second, agricultural tool manufacturing plants and fertilizer plants must start working immediately to solve the current fertilizer needs on the one hand, and start preparing for this year's winter plowing and winter sowing and next year's great leap forward in production on the other hand. Third, each county should start pilot work on deep-digging, improving soil, leveling land, and other arable land transformation work during the summer planting in order to fully unfold it during winter plowing and winter sowing.
    (Our newspaper) Sichuan Province, on the basis of this year's bumper spring harvest, is taking measures to strive for a greater harvest next year. In late May, the Rural Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed at a telephone conference attended by the heads of rural work departments of various prefectural committees: immediately take action, mobilize the vast cadres and masses, seize the opportunity, and do a good job in preparing for the production of next year's spring crops. The meeting believed that the following tasks must be done well at present:
    1. Do a good job in seed selection and seed retention. This year, the increased production of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops in various parts of Sichuan shows that the better the popularization of improved varieties, the greater the increase in production, and vice versa. Therefore, improved varieties should be universally used in this year's winter sowing, and various places are required to vigorously select and retain improved varieties during the current rush harvest. At the same time, in order to adapt to the appropriate expansion of the area of spring crops and the increase in the degree of close planting next year, more seeds should also be retained.
    2. Increase fertilizer accumulation. Everyone believes that increasing fertilizer accumulation is a very urgent task. This year, many high-yield miracles have appeared in various places, with wheat yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, rapeseed yields exceeding 500 jin per mu, and other high-yield beans. The common feature of these high-yield achievements is that they are produced under the condition of large-scale fertilization. In order to provide sufficient fertilizer for winter sowing, a year-round fertilizer accumulation plan should be formulated immediately, and a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign should be launched while the green grass is lush. We should also vigorously use indigenous methods to produce chemical fertilizers, advocate agricultural cooperatives to run granular fertilizer plants, so that the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land this winter sowing can be several times more than this year's spring crops.
    3. Timely summarize high-yield experiences, improve cultivation techniques, especially promote the experience and effect of close planting and deep plowing.
    4. Carry out the planning and preparation work for various basic construction projects in this year's winter production. Such as building water conservancy, improving soil, and transforming slopes.
    At present, activities for preparing for next year's spring production are actively unfolding in various parts of Sichuan. Neijiang, Luzhou, and other prefectures have universally promoted field seed selection, and the amount of seed retention is generally more than half higher than last year. The summer fertilizer accumulation campaign in many prefectures such as Mianyang, Suining, Nanchong, and Neijiang has been fully launched on the basis of the end of the spring crop rush harvest. Indigenous chemical fertilizer plants and granular fertilizer plants have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. A township in Wulong County has recently built nineteen small fertilizer plants.

    不断革命　不断跃进
    河北福建四川安排明年增产措施
    本报天津5日电　记者张华报道：河北省在最近召开的全省农业技术革命现场会议上总结了今年的麦田管理经验，确定打破迷信普遍推广十项技术措施，大搞技术改革，保证明年的小麦丰收，一年改变河北省的小麦生产面貌。
    河北省推行的十项麦田增产技术措施，是根据解放思想、打破迷信的精神制订的。制订这些技术措施的基本出发点是：打破过去单项措施的管理方法，集中水、肥、土、种籽、密植等多方面的增产因素，综合起来保证麦田增产；大胆运用几年来群众创造典型高额丰产的经验，普遍推广今年出现的许多大面积的丰产经验，全面提高全省麦田的耕作技术；继续发扬人定胜天的毅力，推广今年战胜严重旱灾争得麦田丰收的经验，战胜自然，防灾保收，确保增产。
    这十项技术措施包括如下的一些主要内容。一、继续兴修水利工程，使明年的所有麦田都能浇灌、排水，旱涝保收。二、立即开展夏季积肥运动，保证每亩麦田施两万斤质量较好的粗肥。有条件的县乡社还要普遍建化肥厂制化肥，准备麦田追肥。三、播种前麦地普遍深耕深翻一尺左右，改良麦田的土壤。四、明年的麦田普遍换种优良品种。五、提前整地备种备肥，适时的提早播种。六、大力推广宽播幅的宽垅密植，每亩保出五十万个有效穗，给大面积的套种间作创造条件。七、浇五次水追三次肥，抓紧越冬、返青、孕穗等五个环节，及时浇水追肥。八、及时中耕除草保墒。九、防除一切病虫害。秋季播种时普遍浸种、用药剂拌种和施毒饵防治地下害虫，现在就要作药械准备。十、适时收打，精打细收。
    会议认为，在全省普遍推广上述措施，改变小麦的种植技术，明年就能迅速提高河北省的小麦产量，改变小麦的生产面貌，并促进全省的粮食生产的大跃进。推广上述技术措施，可以将大量种植冬小麦的位置，由现在的石家庄保定以南地区推移到保定天津以北（坝上地区除外）地区，使这些新麦区由现在大量的杂粮单作，改变为大量粮麦套作，由一年一熟改为两年三熟。冀中杂粮区和沿海稻田区，也可利用这些技术，实行粮麦套作、麦稻连作，变一年一熟为两年三熟或一年两收。产棉区采用这些技术在棉垅中套种小麦和其他早熟作物，也可作到棉麦两收。根据河北省已有经验，全面推行十项小麦增产技术，特别是水、肥、土、良种、密植等技术，实现麦田耕作园田化，一般麦田的亩产量即将大大提高。根据会议预计，河北省大胆采用上述十项措施保证实现明年的小麦增产计划后，明年的夏收产量将大大增加。
    河北省今年种植冬小麦两千七百多万亩，另外还有一千四百多万亩春麦和其他早熟作物。现在这省卫运河、滏阳河和滹沱河流域等几个主要产麦区的小麦已日渐黄熟，根据初步测产估计，全省的小麦丰收，已成定局。并且还出现了安国、正定等几个亩产四百斤的县，许多亩产五百斤、八百斤、一千斤的大面积丰产典型，打破了历来小麦产量不高的老规律。因此，这次会议将破除迷信改进小麦增产技术作为重要内容来研究。会议期间，从省级到县级的党政领导负责干部，一起到安国、正定等地大面积丰产麦田里去参观受教育，扭转认为小麦不能大量增产的迷信思想。许多人看了甘薯茬种的丰产麦，都转变了原来倒不过茬不能扩大麦田的迷信思想。人们受到大面积丰产麦田的鼓舞，决心在明年争取更大的丰收。
    本报福州5日电　中共福建省委从5月26日到6月2日召开的农村工作会议，在认真学习了社会主义建设总路线以后，决定进一步加快农业生产的发展速度，争取明年来一个更大的跃进，赢得更大面积的丰收。会议并且决定从现在起就着手进行今冬明春的生产准备工作。
    福建省今年的农业生产已经开始呈现大丰收的景象。油菜、越冬甘薯等春收作物已获得空前丰收，全省一千多万亩早稻、花生等夏收作物生长空前良好。只要继续注意克服右倾保守思想和战胜可能发生的一些自然灾害，完全有可能完成或超额完成今年生产一百一十亿斤粮食的跃进规划。
    会议根据今年的经验和事先深入的调查研究，订出了七项措施，保证明年农业更大的跃进。
    第一，坚持不懈地结合各个生产季节，轰轰烈烈地深入开展群众性的以农具改革为中心的技术革命运动。第二，在今年冬种开始前后掀起一个全民性的深挖田地、改良土壤的改造耕地运动。第三，开展一个比今年更大规模的全民积肥造肥运动。乡乡社社都要因地制宜建立肥料厂；省工业部门应有重点地举办较大型的化肥厂、细菌肥料厂；根据矿藏和海肥情况，县县建立一个硫酸铵厂、颗粒肥料厂和海肥制造厂等。第四，进一步改进水利设施，实现灌溉系统化。第五，普及良种并使农业社留种田制度化，全面贯彻“种子自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅以调剂”的种子工作方针。没有采用良种的农作物，明年一律都要改用当地良种。第六，大力防治病虫鸟兽灾害。第七，继续贯彻开展以早插密植为中心的栽培技术改革运动。
    为了保证这些增产措施的实现，会议要求全省各级领导和有关部门从现在起，及早动手做好以下几项准备工作：第一，各县从现在起就做好冬种种子准备工作，在夏收前把今年冬种安排和明年生产规划定下来，并下达到乡、社。各乡各社在夏收夏种后，结合做好秋季丰收工作的同时，立即进行冬耕冬种的各种物质准备。第二，农具制造厂、肥料厂现在都要马上动手搞起来，以便一方面解决当前用肥需要，一方面就开始为今年冬耕冬种和明年生产大跃进作准备。第三，各县都要在夏种时着手深挖、改良土壤、平整土地等改造耕地的试点工作，以便在冬耕冬种中全面展开。
    本报讯　四川省在今年小春丰收的基础上，正采取措施争取明年获得更大的丰收。五月下旬，中共四川省委农村工作部在各地委农村工作部长参加的电话会议上提出：立即行动起来，发动广大干部、群众，抓紧时机，作好明年小春作物生产的各项准备工作。会议认为当前必须做好下列工作：
    一、做好选种、留种工作。今年，四川各地小麦、油菜等增产情况表明，那里良种普及得好，那里增产幅度就大，反之就小。因此，今年冬播中应普遍使用良种，要求各地在当前抢收中大力选留良种。同时，为了适应明年小春作物面积适当扩大和密植程度增加，还应多留种子。
    二、增积肥料。大家认为增积肥料是十分迫切的任务。今年，各地出现了许多高产奇迹，亩产一千斤以上的小麦、亩产五百斤以上的油菜以及其他高产豆类，这些高产成就的共同特点都是在大量施肥的条件下产生的。为了给冬播提供足够肥料，应立即订出全年积肥规划，并趁当前青草茂盛的时机开展一次夏季积肥运动。还应大力用土法生产化肥，提倡农业社办颗粒肥料厂，使今年冬播每亩地施肥量能比今年小春作物增加几倍以上。
    三、及时总结高产经验，改进耕作技术，特别是推广密植和深耕的经验和效果。
    四、进行今年冬季生产中各项基本建设的规划准备工作。如兴修水利、改良土壤、改造坡地等。
    目前，四川各地为明年小春生产做准备的活动正在积极展开。内江、泸州等专区都普遍推行了田间选种，留种量比去年一般都多一半以上。绵阳、遂宁、南充、内江等许多专区的夏季积肥运动已经在小春作物抢收结束的基础上全面展开。土化肥厂、颗粒肥料厂也如雨后春笋，武隆县的一个乡在最近就已建成了十九个小肥料厂。（附图片）
