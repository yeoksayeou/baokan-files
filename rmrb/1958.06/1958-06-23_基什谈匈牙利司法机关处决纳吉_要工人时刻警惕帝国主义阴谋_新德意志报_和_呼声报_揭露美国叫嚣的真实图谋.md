Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 21st:  Károly Kiss, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee, said at a mass meeting in Budapest on the 20th that the Hungarian judicial organs' judgment a few days ago on the case of the Nagy-Losonczy group, the instigators and organizers of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, was serious and just. All honest Hungarian working people have been expecting this judgment, and they all support it. This judgment is a warning to all thugs who attempt to undermine the people's regime, and reminds them that these thugs cannot escape justice.

Kiss made these remarks at a mass meeting at one of Budapest's largest enterprises, the MÁVAG Machine Factory. The meeting commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the massacre of workers at the factory for demanding higher wages.

In his speech, Kiss emphasized that the Hungarian working people should not have the illusion that the imperialists have abandoned their attempts to detach Hungary from the socialist camp. He called on the workers to hold their weapons firmly and never relax their vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialists.

Kiss said that the investigated facts prove that the Nagy group had contact with the Yugoslav Embassy in Hungary, and even when they were hiding in the South Embassy building, they continued to carry out hostile activities against the worker-peasant revolutionary government. Even so, we have tried our best not to rupture relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia and are willing to maintain friendly relations, but whether the two countries can maintain this relationship in the future will not depend solely on us.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st:  According to a report by the German News Agency, "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 20th regarding the execution of Hungarian counter-revolutionary ringleader Nagy, saying that the bourgeois press, under the instruction of Eisenhower and Dulles, has reached the peak of hypocrisy by using the Nagy execution as an excuse to stir up frenzied clamor against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and against the Soviet Union. The editorial pointed out, "In Algeria, Cyprus, and many other places in the world, hundreds of fighters for freedom, civilians, and even women and children are tortured and shot every day, but these bourgeois newspapers have never expressed the slightest 'regret.'"

The editorial also condemned Washington's attempt to use this incident as an excuse to carry out its conspiracy to obstruct the holding of a summit meeting. The editorial said that the further development of history is not determined by the rulers in Washington or anywhere else. The people are unwilling to be led astray by this artificially incited new hatred.

The editorial continued that imperialists are accustomed to using the false socialist rhetoric of revisionism to conceal their true intentions. This is the case in Hungary. The editorial pointed out, "The right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party in West Germany, the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party in Britain, Guy Mollet of France, and many union leaders in the United States are all using revisionist theories to paralyze the working class. The revisionist theories of the leading group of the Yugoslav Communist Party are particularly appreciated by the imperialist rulers, because in their minds, these theories are best suited to creating chaos and disintegration within socialist countries that have already seized power by the working class."

The editorial finally emphasized: "The struggle against all kinds of revisionism from different sources is a task of decisive significance for the international workers' movement, and the lessons of the Hungarian events also show this. The workers' movements in all countries must carry out this struggle, and it should be carried out by the workers themselves."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 20th (TASS): "Al-Shaab" writes that the death sentence of traitor Imre Nagy and his three accomplices has become an excuse for the imperialists to clamor greatly in this regard.

The newspaper writes that the United States immediately called the traitor Imre Nagy and his accomplices "martyrs." As for the millions of people who are being killed by imperialists today in Algeria, Aden, Lebanon, Indonesia, and other parts of the world, the imperialists regard them as "thugs and rebels." The United States subjects black people in the southern states to lynching and torture; savagely exploits millions of working people in the world, but the U.S. imperialists believe that all of this does not matter and is not worth paying attention to. The newspaper emphasized that U.S. imperialists and their apologists have no right to talk about so-called "humanitarianism" in the sentencing of the traitor Nagy Imre in Hungary, because Nagy Imre killed hundreds of people during the Hungarian riots that were planned by the imperialists in order to restore the fascist regime in Hungary.

    基什谈匈牙利司法机关处决纳吉
    要工人时刻警惕帝国主义阴谋
    “新德意志报”和“呼声报”揭露美国叫嚣的真实图谋
    新华社布达佩斯21日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员基什·卡罗伊20日在布达佩斯一个群众大会上说，匈牙利司法机关前几天对反革命叛乱的煽动者和组织者纳吉——洛松齐集团的案件的判决是严肃而公正的。一切正直的匈牙利劳动人民一直在期待着这个判决，他们都拥护这个判决。这个判决是对一切企图破坏人民政权的歹徒的一个警告，并提醒他们：这些歹徒是不可能逍遥法外的。
    基什是在布达佩斯最大的企业之一——马瓦格机器制造厂的群众大会讲这些话的。这次大会是纪念这个工厂的工人为要求提高工资而被杀害的惨案四十周年。
    基什在讲话中着重指出，匈牙利劳动人民不应该有这样的幻想：似乎帝国主义者已放弃了使匈牙利脱离社会主义国家阵营的企图。他号召工人们握紧武器，时刻也不要放松对帝国主义者阴谋的警惕。
    基什说，根据调查的事实证明，纳吉集团和南斯拉夫驻匈牙利使馆有联系，甚至当他们藏在南使馆大楼时，还继续进行反对工农革命政府的敌对活动。虽然如此，我们还竭力不使匈南两国关系破裂，愿保持友好关系，但是以后两国是否还能保持这种关系，那就不只取决于我们了。
    新华社21日讯    据德意志通讯社报道，“新德意志报”20日就匈牙利反革命头子纳吉伏法事发表社论说，在艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯授意下，资产阶级报刊借纳吉伏法事挑起的反对匈牙利人民共和国政府和反对苏联的疯狂叫嚣真是伪善的顶峰。社论指出，“在阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯和世界上其他许多地方，每天都有成百的争取自由的战士、平民、甚至妇孺遭到酷刑和枪杀，而这些资产阶级报刊却不曾表示过半点‘遗憾’。”
    社论还谴责华盛顿企图利用这件事作借口来遂行其阻挠举行最高级会议的阴谋。社论说，历史的进一步发展并不是由华盛顿或者其他任何地方的统治者来决定的。人民不愿意让自己被这种人为地煽起的新仇恨导入歧途。
    社论接着说，帝国主义者惯于利用修正主义的假社会主义言辞来掩饰他们的真实图谋。匈牙利的情况就是如此。社论指出，“西德的社会民主党右翼领导人、英国的工党右翼领导人、法国的居伊·摩勒和美国许多工会领导人，他们都是用修正主义的理论来麻痹工人阶级。南共领导集团的修正主义理论特别受到帝国主义统治者的赏识，因为在他们的心目中，这些理论最适于在已经由工人阶级掌握政权的社会主义国家内部造成混乱和解体。
    社论最后着重指出：“对各色各样的、不同来源的修正主义进行斗争是国际工人运动具有决定意义的任务，匈牙利事件的教训也表明了这一点。各国的工人运动都必须进行这个斗争，而且应该由工人自己来进行。”
    新华社21日讯  塔斯社大马士革20日讯：“呼声报”写道，叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷和他的三个同谋者被判处死刑一事成了帝国主义者在这方面大事叫嚣的借口。
    报纸写道，美国立刻把叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者称为“殉难者”。至于今天在阿尔及利亚、亚丁、黎巴嫩、印度尼西亚和世界上其它地区被帝国主义者杀害的千千万万人士，帝国主义者却把他们看成是“暴徒和叛乱者”。美国私刑拷打南部各州的黑人；野蛮地剥削世界上的数以百万计的劳动人民，而美帝国主义者认为这一切都没有关系，是不值得注意的。报纸强调指出，美帝国主义者和他们的辩护者没有任何权利在匈牙利人民的叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷被判刑这件事上高谈所谓“人道主义”，因为纳吉·伊姆雷在帝国主义者为了想在匈牙利复辟法西斯政权而策划的匈牙利暴乱期间杀害了数以百计的人。
