　　Living Systems Should Not Be Executed Rigidly
    On the afternoon of May 12th, a dispute occurred between a passenger and a ticket seller at the Dongdan Railway Ticket Office in Beijing. The reason was that the passenger lived across the street from the ticket office and wanted to take the pre-sale ticket himself, which would save both the 15-cent delivery fee and the delivery person's trouble. However, the ticket seller insisted on delivering the ticket. Why deliver the ticket when the distance is so short? The reason given was for the convenience of passengers, that delivering tickets was their system, and they had to follow the system.
    The same thing happened to me. I live in the Commercial Department Guest House in Dengshikou, less than half a mile from the ticket office, and I still have to wait for the delivery person to bring the ticket to my door. The whole country is leaping forward, and everyone is opposing unreasonable rules and regulations. I hope the Beijing Railway Administration will study your ticket delivery system.

　　活制度不能死执行
    5月12日下午，在北京东单铁路售票所内发生了一起旅客与售票员争吵的事情。原因是这位旅客居住在售票所的对门，他想把预售票自己带走，这样做既节省了一角五分的送票费，也省去了送票员的麻烦。可是售票员却坚持一定要送票。距离这样近，为什么要送票呢？他的理由是为了旅客方便，送票是他们的制度，一定要按制度办事。
    这样的事情也曾发生在我的身上，我住在灯市口商业部招待所内，离售票所不到半里路，同样要等送票员把车票送上门来。全国都在跃进，都在反对不合理的规章制度。希望北京铁路管理局研究一下你们的送票制度。
