    Thorez and Duclos
    Refuse to Meet with de Gaulle
    De Gaulle Intensifies Coercion of Parties to Let Him Take Office
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch, Paris: Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and Jacques Duclos, Chairman of the Communist Party's parliamentary group, announced on the 30th that they had refused President Coty's invitation to meet with him. Coty invited leaders of various political parties to meet with him to discuss the issue of de Gaulle forming a government.
    In their letter to Coty, Thorez and Duclos said: "Fully aware of our responsibilities and loyal to the mandate of six million French people, we are unwilling to participate in this farce, which aims to give a cloak of legitimacy to the surrender to the coup d'état in Algeria and Corsica that attempted to bring General de Gaulle to power by force."
    "After you summoned General de Gaulle in violation of the clearly expressed will of the National Assembly, it is no longer a matter of consulting with various political parties in accordance with constitutional provisions, but merely of approving a decision that runs counter to the expressed wishes of the national representative body, which has been subjected to intolerable pressure by your letters."
    Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch, Paris: On May 30th, French President Coty and de Gaulle engaged in a two-pronged effort to urge various parties to quickly accept de Gaulle's assumption of power. Coty began meeting with leaders of all parties except the Communist Party on the morning of that day. De Gaulle received Social Party General Secretary Mollet, Social Party elder Auriol, and Social Party parliamentary group Chairman Deixonne on the same day, and held a round-table meeting with leaders of all parties except the Communist Party at 11:00 AM Paris time on the 31st. Sources say that de Gaulle demanded at this meeting that the various political parties answer him by 5:00 PM local time today: whether they agree to his taking office or not. If the answer is favorable to him, he will go to the National Assembly tonight or tomorrow morning to request a mandate to form a cabinet.
    It is revealed that de Gaulle has already drawn up a list of members for his cabinet, including Independent Party's Pinay, Social Party's Mollet, and Popular Republican Party's Pflimlin. His future cabinet will also include three non-Communist trade union leaders. These messages were revealed after de Gaulle met with Social Party leaders on the 30th.

    多列士和杜克洛
    拒绝同戈蒂会谈
    戴高乐加紧胁迫各党派让他上台
    新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士和共产党议会党团主席杜克洛30日宣布拒绝同法国总统戈蒂进行会谈的邀请。戈蒂邀请各政党领袖同他会晤，是要讨论对于戴高乐组织政府的问题。
    多列士和杜克洛在写给戈蒂的信里说：“由于充分意识到我们的责任并且忠实于六百万法国人的委托，我们不愿意参与这种丑剧，这种丑剧的目的是要给向阿尔及利亚和科西嘉企图用武力使戴高乐将军上台的政变投降这件事披上合法的外衣。”
    “在你违反国民议会明白表示的意志而召请戴高乐将军以后，现在再也不是什么依照宪法规定同各政党协商的问题，而只是要批准一个同国民代议机构所表明的意愿背道而驰的决定，这个代议机构已经由于你的信件而遭到不能容许的压力。”
    据新华社31日讯　巴黎消息：5月30日，法国总统戈蒂和戴高乐进行了双管齐下的活动，鞭策各党派迅速接受戴高乐上台。戈蒂从这一天上午开始就同除了共产党以外的各个政党的领袖会谈。戴高乐在这一天接见了社会党总书记摩勒、社会党元老阿里奥尔和社会党议会党团主席戴克松，并且在31日上午巴黎时间十一点钟同除了共产党以外的所有党派的领导人举行了圆桌会议。有消息说，戴高乐在这次会议上要求各个政党在今天下午当地时间五点钟回答戴高乐：赞成他上台或者不赞成他上台。如果答复对他有利，他就要在今天晚间或者明天上午去国民议会请求授命组阁。
    据透露，戴高乐已经拟定了他的内阁成员的名单，其中有独立党的比内、社会党的摩勒和人民共和党的弗林姆兰。他的未来的内阁还将包括三个非共产党人的工会领袖在内。这些消息是在戴高乐30日同社会党领袖们会谈之后透露出来的。
