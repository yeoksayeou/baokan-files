　　Thoroughly Smash Conservative Thinking, Unleash a Greater Leap Forward High Tide
　　Zhang Anguo, First Secretary of the Tongcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui Province
    Tongcheng County is mostly hilly and mountainous, with very few polder fields. The county has 640,000 mu of paddy fields and 110,000 mu of dry land, with poor soil. Before liberation, it was threatened by floods and droughts every year, and the yield per mu was only about 300 jin. The local people said it was "land where you can't even grow maggots, relying on the heavens for harvest." Even the better-conditioned polder fields were hard to guarantee a good harvest every year. The people said, "Like watching a sow, planting in a polder, harvest one year, count one year." After liberation, the situation has fundamentally changed. Except for the devastating flood disaster in 1954, grain production has increased year by year.
    From the agricultural production situation in Tongcheng County in the past few years and the recent great leap forward in agricultural production, we have deeply realized that the leap forward in agricultural production must be based on the leap forward in thought. Only with a leap forward in thought can we bring about a leap forward in agricultural production. In other words, in order to achieve a leap forward in agricultural production, the first thing is to constantly struggle against the right-leaning conservative ideas that hinder the leap forward in agricultural production.
    Those with right-leaning conservative ideas always stubbornly say that grain production can only increase slowly, and the pace cannot be too big; they also say that grain production has reached its peak, and the yield per unit area cannot be increased anymore; they say that too much double-cropping rice is planted, the multiple cropping index is too high, and the labor and animal power are too strained; they also oppose dense planting, and worry that water conservancy work cannot keep up, fertilizer cannot be found, and potential has been exhausted. These erroneous arguments of theirs had a certain influence among the masses before they were thoroughly criticized. It is precisely on the basis of organizing the masses to conduct fierce struggles against right-leaning conservative ideas, and thoroughly criticizing and overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas, that we have mobilized the masses and created a high tide of the great leap forward in agricultural production last winter and this spring.
    First, we calculated the accounts of grain production increases in 1956 and 1957 with them. 1956 was a year of major disasters in Tongcheng. First there was drought, then flood, and then typhoon disasters. The disaster area reached more than 300,000 mu, accounting for 40% of the county's 750,000 mu of farmland. At that time, the cooperatives had not been established for long and lacked experience, but because the masses, after successfully realizing agricultural cooperation, were encouraged by Chairman Mao's instructions to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the draft agricultural development program, they mustered revolutionary spirit and actively promoted the "three changes" method (expanding the multiple cropping area by 214%, and planting 450,000 mu of double-cropping rice). This year, grain production increased by 80 million jin compared with the very good year of 1955 (an increase of 22.8%), and the average yield per mu reached 614 jin, an increase of 114 jin over the average yield per mu in 1955. The increase in production in 1956 proved that not only can grain production be greatly increased under normal circumstances, and those who believe that grain production can only be increased slowly year by year are wrong, but it also proves that as long as the socialist awareness of cadres and the masses is raised, revolutionary spirit is mustered, and practical measures are taken, even in the event of general disasters, production can still be increased. 1957 did not suffer from natural disasters, and the history of the cooperatives was one year longer, and all objective conditions were better than in 1956, but this year, due to the influence of the right-leaning conservative ideas against "rash advance," those cadres with right-leaning conservative ideas even resonated with the rich middle peasants who were dissatisfied with cooperation, and at the same time, bad elements took the opportunity to sabotage. As a result, the revolutionary spirit of the masses was hit, their enthusiasm for production declined, and the area of double-cropping rice was reduced from 450,000 mu in 1956 to 320,000 mu. Therefore, although there were conditions for a greater increase in production this year, the actual increase was only 20 million jin, only one-quarter of the increase in grain production in 1956, with an average yield of 690 jin per mu, only 66 jin more than in 1956. Does this fact not prove how serious the losses brought to grain production by the man-made disaster of right-leaning conservative ideas are? Does this not prove how lacking in basic basis the argument that "grain production has reached its peak and the potential has been exhausted" is? After this comparative accounting, the masses saw more clearly that right-leaning conservative ideas are the real reason for hindering grain production, and realized that the harm of right-leaning conservative ideas is no less than that of floods and droughts.
    Secondly, taking a look at the fact that many large areas in Tongcheng County have had high yields in the past two years, it can be fully proved that the increase in production is far from reaching its peak, and the potential is far from being exhausted. In 1957, eight townships and fifty agricultural cooperatives in Tongcheng County had 160,000 mu of land with a yield per mu exceeding the agricultural development program target, reaching 858 jin. Among them, 25 agricultural cooperatives and one state-owned farm had 17,042 mu of land with a yield per mu reaching 1,075 jin. At the same time, a group of high-yield fields also appeared, with yields per mu reaching 2,070 jin in hilly areas, 2,529 jin in polder areas, and 2,444 jin in mountainous areas. This shows that our current grain production is still far from the yield of these high-yield fields.
    In particular, many practical achievements that the masses have already made in the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring have more powerfully shattered many arguments of those right-leaning conservatives.
    After the cadres and masses of Tongcheng County were educated on the two roads on the basis of rectification and social rectification, they launched a great debate, criticized and overcame right-leaning conservative ideas, drew a clear line of demarcation, distinguished right from wrong, and significantly improved their political and ideological awareness. At the same time, due to the implementation of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, the promulgation of the revised draft of the agricultural development program, and encouraged by the call of the central and provincial party committees to "complete the agricultural development program ahead of schedule and catch up with and surpass the production and living standards of well-to-do middle peasants," the county party committee also put forward the requirement to use revolutionary spirit to work hard, work fiercely, and work greatly for one year to catch up with Xiaogan and surpass neighboring counties. Therefore, a mass movement to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 was quickly set off among cadres and the masses. This kind of enthusiasm for building socialism is truly "more fierce than floods and higher than Mount Tai." Many cadres, like tigers and dragons, came up with ideas, found tricks, and worked hard. The cadres of Shihe Township proposed that cadres should have three heads (barefoot, shaved head, and taking the lead in production) and four-izations (cadres becoming farmers, life becoming mass-based, production becoming regularized, and actions becoming combat-oriented). Zhang Zecheng, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the Qianjin Cooperative in Gaoqiao Township, said: "The strong wind cannot break my perseverance, the steel knife cannot cut off my determination, difficulties cannot scare my confidence, and I will resolutely be of one heart with everyone to achieve a yield of 1,600 jin per mu." The masses were even more motivated, and men, women, old and young all joined the torrent of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Many people described the enthusiasm for production as: "The courage of young people surpasses Zhao Yun, the strength of adults surpasses Wu Song, children are like Luo Cheng, the elderly work like Huang Zhong, cadres surpass Zhuge Liang, and women surpass Mu Guiying." Many areas put forward production slogans saying: "Seize sunny days, rush on cloudy days, treat light rain and light snow as good weather, use lanterns and torches as daylight, get up early and rest late as half a day, and work one day is worth two days." The district and township cadres summarized the situation in the countryside as "five bigs" and "five smalls." "Five bigs" are: "Mass mobilization is big, enthusiasm is big, drilling is big, manure heaps are big, and the leap forward in various tasks is big." "Five smalls" are: "Few complaints, few people going to the city, few people failing to complete tasks, few idlers, and few gossips." At present, a new atmosphere that people did not expect has indeed appeared in the countryside.
    After the cadres and the masses had mustered their energy and brought their initiative into full play, after extensive deliberation and discussion, a target for the leap forward in grain production in 1958 was put forward. This target requires that in 1958, the average yield of grain per mu in the county should be guaranteed to reach 1,000 jin (an increase of 45% over 1957), striving to reach 1,500 jin. Even in the event of a major flood disaster like the one in 1954, it is necessary to guarantee 800 jin, that is to say, under any circumstances, the grain target proposed in the revised draft of the agricultural development program must be completed.
    In order to ensure the realization of this target, the county party committee, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities, promptly put forward powerful measures such as building water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, improving farming techniques, expanding the multiple cropping area and the double-cropping rice area, and strengthening field management. Last winter and this spring, after several months of efforts by the broad masses of the people, they have achieved many successes in implementing these measures:
    First, in terms of water conservancy projects, 8,192 new and renovated water conservancy projects were built, three major rivers were harnessed, and many pond and dam projects were carried out. An old scholar also praised the magnificent spirit of the whole people harnessing water, and he wrote a Spring Festival couplet on his door saying: "Ten thousand people open mountains, the Foolish Old Man bows his hands; thousands of troops harness water, Dayu lowers his head." Calculated on the basis of the current engineering benefits, it is now possible to achieve about sixty days without rain or drought, and 250 mm of rainfall within three days will not be affected by disasters (300 mm in 1954). The main dikes can guarantee that the great flood of 1954 will not break, basically eliminating general floods and droughts.
    Second, in terms of accumulating fertilizer, the masses in Tongcheng showed even more outstanding enthusiasm. At present, the county has accumulated more than 2.4 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average of 3,000 dan of fertilizer per mu. The annual plan is to accumulate more than 3.6 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average of 4,500 dan per mu (1,500 dan in the second season). Because 3,000 dan of fertilizer per mu has been applied, the farmland is now two inches higher than before. The masses reflected that: 3,000 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer will increase the field by two inches, guaranteeing more than 1,000 jin. Many people originally thought that there was no fertilizer to accumulate, but now they all reflect that "fertilizer is everywhere, just afraid of not starting," and they are now full of confidence in accumulating fertilizer. This year, so much fertilizer was accumulated, which was entirely achieved by mobilizing the masses and everyone trying their best to find fertilizer sources. Tongcheng has found more than 40 kinds of fertilizer sources. In order to widely tap fertilizer sources, the methods they put forward are: "Every household has a cattle tail stove, every hill has a field head cellar, and there is also a marching stove." The masses summed up their fertilizer accumulation experience as "There is no skill in accumulating fertilizer, ten characters must be kept in mind: burn, smoke, dig, exchange, sweep, shovel, soak, pile, pick up, and fish out." Burn means burning steamed buns, burning earth kilns, and burning the soil in the center of the pot; smoke means cattle tail stoves and marching stoves; dig means digging pond mud, digging ditch mud, digging the bottom of toilets, cow pens, and pigsties, digging old house foundations, and in Xin'dian Township, digging for fertilizer uncovered an ancient street two miles long, which is said to be from the Three Kingdoms period, not only accumulating fertilizer, but also digging out many gold, silver, treasures, and antiquities; exchange means exchanging stove platform soil, exchanging old wall soil, exchanging old roof grass, and exchanging domestic soil for wild soil; sweep means sweeping garbage, sweeping chimney ash on walls and roofs, and diligently cleaning inside and outside the house, cow pens, and pigsties; shovel means shoveling turf, shoveling foot mud, and shoveling walls; soak means beating green grass, soaking green manure, and soaking liquid manure; pile means using green grass skin and lime to make compost; pick up means picking up wild manure and miscellaneous manure; fish out means fishing out pond mud and water plants. In addition, the widespread promotion of the manufacture of granular fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and artificial urine. After accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, the difficulties of large fertilizer transportation tasks, tight time, and insufficient labor immediately appeared. The main method we used to overcome this difficulty was to create and improve fertilizer transportation tools, create cattle carts, flat carts, and earth carts to realize cart-ization, create aerial ropeways, and use bucket water transportation in ditches. A total of more than 40,000 tools were made. It was originally planned that it would take 50 to 60 days to send all the fertilizer, but after the tool reform and increased efficiency, it was sent in 15 to 20 days. It also reduced labor by more than 20,000 people. According to the experience of increasing fertilizer application to improve soil in the past few years, if we calculate that increasing fertilizer application by 600 dan per mu last year can increase grain production by 40 jin, then this year the fertilizer has increased by six times compared with last year, and each mu can increase grain production by about 240 jin, and the county can increase grain production by 180 million jin.
    Third, in terms of improving farming techniques, according to the experiments in Tongcheng in the past two years, dense planting in three- and six-inch rows increases production by about 30% compared with general sparse planting in six- or seven-inch squares, with some reaching an increase of 67%. The masses summarized the benefits of dense planting as: "Three and six inches is good, mountains and polder areas can do it, more ears, full grains, every root becomes a forest with few heads, emerges neatly, yellows early, can withstand drought, less grass grows, can withstand fertilizer, does not fall, more grain is harvested, more grass is harvested, firmly grasp this treasure, one mu of one thousand jin cannot run away." This time, the county summarized the dense planting experience, educated the masses, held training classes, selected rice planting experts, and created and promoted straight-line planters and rice planting boats, and comprehensively promoted three- and six-inch dense planting. And used a method of more points and less area to test two-five and three-legged dense planting. To prepare for whether further dense planting can be carried out next year. According to the experience of the past two years, if the increase in production by dense planting is calculated at 30%, each mu will increase production by 240 jin, and the county will increase production by about 172.2 million jin.
    Fourth, expand the multiple cropping area and high-yield crops, and widely promote double-cropping rice. The double-cropping rice has expanded from 320,000 mu last year to 470,000 mu this year, accounting for 73.4% of the county's paddy fields. According to the experience of the past few years, the increase in production of double-cropping rice is guaranteed. In dry land, we adopted three-season continuous cropping, implemented measures such as planting high-yield crops, dense planting, deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, and intercropping corn, and required catching up with the yield of paddy fields. We also took various measures to strengthen field management. Due to the adoption of these measures, it is estimated that expanding the area by 250,000 mu, including expanding the midday and spring crops by 100,000 mu, each mu can increase production by 200 jin, for a total increase of 21 million jin; expanding double-cropping rice by 150,000 mu, each mu can increase production by about 300 jin, for a total increase of 45 million jin; expanding sweet potatoes by 20,000 mu, converted into the original grain, each mu can increase production by about 500 jin, for a total increase of 10 million jin. The above totals an increase in production of about 76 million jin.
    According to the development situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production in the past few months and preliminary calculations, in 1958, on the basis of the output of 450 million jin in 1957, grain production may increase by 442 million jin, for a total of 892 million jin, and the average yield per mu can reach 1,250 jin. Assuming that due to the failure of certain measures to be realized or the encounter of floods and droughts, reducing the output by 300 million jin (the great flood in 1954 reduced the output by 160 million jin), it can still maintain 592 million jin, that is, it can still reach a yield of about 1,000 jin per mu. Therefore, we have full confidence in realizing the planned target for grain production increase in 1958. At the same time, we firmly believe that the result of the great leap forward in agricultural production in the country in 1958 will more thoroughly shatter all right-leaning conservative ideas, and will certainly promote a greater high tide of agricultural production leap forward in the future.

　　彻底粉碎保守思想，掀起更大跃进高潮
　　中共安徽省桐城县委第一书记　张安国
    桐城县大部分是丘陵地带和山区，圩田很少，全县计有田六十四万亩，地十一万亩，土地瘦瘠。解放以前，年年遭受水旱灾害的威胁，每亩粮食产量仅有三百斤左右。当地群众说是“拉屎不生蛆的田，靠天收”。就是条件较好的圩田，每年收成也很难有保证，群众说：“看母猪，插圩田，收一年，算一年”。解放以后，情况有了根本变化，除1954年遭受了毁灭性的洪水灾害外，粮食产量均逐年有所提高。
    从桐城县过去几年农业生产情况和最近农业生产大跃进形势中，我们深刻地体会到，农业生产的跃进必须是建立在思想跃进的基础上，只有思想上跃进了，才能带来农业生产的跃进。这也就是说，为了实现农业生产的跃进，首先是要不断地和那些阻碍农业生产跃进的右倾保守思想进行斗争。
    那些有右倾保守思想的人，他们总是常常顽固地说什么粮食增产只能慢慢的来，步子不能跨大了；又说什么粮食增产到顶了，单产不能再提高了；他们说双季稻种得太多了，复种指数搞得太大了，劳力畜力太紧张了；他们还反对密植，还担心什么水利工作赶不上，肥料找不到，潜力挖尽了。他们的这些错误论调，在尚未遭受彻底批判之前，在群众中是有一定影响的。我们正是在组织群众和右倾保守思想进行了激烈的斗争，并彻底批判和克服了右倾保守思想的基础上，发动了群众，造成去冬今春的农业生产大跃进的高潮。
    首先，我们和他们算了算1956年和1957年粮食增产的账。1956年桐城是遭遇灾害较大的一年，先旱后涝，又有台风灾害，受灾面积达三十余万亩，占全县田地七十五万亩的40％，那时合作社也还建立不久，缺乏经验，但是因为群众在胜利地实现了农业合作化之后，又得到毛主席多快好省的指示和农业发展纲要草案的鼓舞，鼓起了革命干劲，积极推行了“三改”办法（扩大复种面积214％，双季稻四十五万亩），这一年粮食产量就比风调雨顺年成很好的1955年增加了八千万斤（增加了22.8％），每亩平均产量达到六百一十四斤，比1955年每亩平均产量增加一百一十四斤。1956年的增产情况，证明了不仅在正常的情况下粮食产量可以大量提高，那些认为粮食产量只能逐年慢慢提高的看法是错误的，而且还证明了只要提高了干部和群众的社会主义的觉悟，鼓起了革命干劲，并采取了切实的措施，就是在遭遇一般灾害的情况下，也仍然可以增产。1957年没有遭受自然灾害，合作社的历史也多了一年，一切客观条件都比1956年好，但是这一年因为受到反“冒进”的右倾保守思想的影响，那些有右倾保守思想的干部甚至和对合作化有不满情绪的富裕中农共鸣，同时坏分子也乘机破坏。这样一来群众的革命干劲受到了打击，生产热情也低落下去了，双季稻面积也由1956年的四十五万亩缩小到三十二万亩。因此这一年虽然存在有更大量增产的条件，但实际上却仅仅增产粮食二千万斤，只达到1956年增产粮食的四分之一，平均每亩产量六百九十斤，比1956年仅增加六十六斤。这一事实，难道还不可以证明右倾保守思想的人为灾害给粮食增产带来的损失是多么严重吗？这难道还不可以证明那些“粮食增产已经到顶，潜力已经挖完”的论调是多么缺乏起码的根据吗？经过这一对比算账以后，群众更清楚地看到了右倾保守思想才是真正阻碍粮食增产的原因，认识到右倾保守思想的危害不小于水旱灾害。
    其次，拿桐城县过去两年许多大面积丰产的事实看，也完全可以证明增产远远没有到顶，潜力也远远没有挖尽。桐城全县1957年已有八个乡和五十个农业社的十六万亩田，亩产已超过农业发展纲要指标，达到八百五十八斤，其中有二十五个农业社和一个国营农场的一万七千零四十二亩田地，亩产已达到一千零七十五斤。同时还出现了一批高额丰产田，丘陵地区亩产已达到二千零七十斤，圩区亩产已达到二千五百二十九斤，山区也达到亩产二千四百四十四斤。这说明我们现有的粮食产量距离这些丰产田产量还是很远的。
    特别是去冬今春群众在生产大跃进中所已经做出的许多实际成绩，更有力地粉碎了那些右倾保守主义者的许多论调。
    桐城县的干部和群众，在整风整社基础上，经过了两条道路的教育，开展了大辩论，批判和克服了右倾保守思想，划清了界限，明辨了是非，政治思想有显著提高。同时由于贯彻了三中全会的精神，农业发展纲要修正草案的公布，并在中央和省委提出的“提前完成农业发展纲要和赶上和超过富裕中农生产和生活水平”号召的鼓舞之下，县委也提出了用革命精神，苦干、猛干、大干一年，赶上孝感，赛过邻县的要求。因此，在干部和群众中迅速掀起了一个争取1958年农业生产大跃进的群众运动的高潮，这一股建设社会主义的干劲，真是“比洪水还猛，比泰山还高”。许多干部像生龙活虎一样，想点子，找窍门，积极苦干。石河乡干部提出干部要三头（赤脚光头，手拿锄头，生产带头），四化（干部农民化，生活群众化，生产经常化，行动战斗化）。高桥乡前进社团支部书记张泽成说：“大风刮不断我的恒心，钢刀刈不断我的决心，困难吓不倒我的信心，坚决和大家一条心，实现亩产一千六百斤。”群众干劲更大，男女老少一起卷入了农业生产大跃进的洪流。许多群众描写生产劲头说：“青年勇气赛赵云，壮年力量赛武松，少年儿童像罗成，老年干活似黄忠，干部赛过诸葛亮，妇女赛过穆桂英”。许多地区提出生产号召说：“抓晴天，赶阴天，小雨小雪当好天，灯笼火把当白天，起早歇晚当半天，干活一天抵二天”。区乡干部总结农村情况是“五大”和“五少”。“五大”是：“群众发动面大，干劲大，钻劲大，肥堆大，各项工作跃进大。”“五少”是：叫苦的少，进城的少，完不成任务的少，闲人少，说闲话的少。目前农村确实出现了一种使人预料不到的新气象。
    在干部和群众都鼓足了干劲，高度发挥了积极性以后，经过大家广泛的酝酿和讨论，提出了一个1958年的粮食产量跃进的指标，这个指标要求在1958年保证全县粮食每亩平均产量达到一千斤（比1957年增加45％），争取达到一千五百斤。即使遇到像1954年那样特大洪水灾害，也要保证达到八百斤，就是说在任何情况下都要完成农业发展纲要修正草案中所提出的粮食指标。
    为了保证这一指标的实现，县委根据上级指示精神及时提出了兴修水利、积肥、改进耕作技术、扩大复种面积和双季稻面积、加强田间管理等有力措施。去冬今春经过广大群众几个月来的努力，他们在执行这些措施方面，已经获得了不少成绩：
    一、水利工程方面，新建和整修水利工程八千一百九十二处，治好了三条大河，作了许多塘坝工程。一个老秀才也歌颂全民治水的雄伟气概，他在门上写的春联说：“万众开山，愚公拱手；千军治水，大禹低头”。以现在的工程效益计算，已经可以做到六十天左右不雨不旱，三天内降雨二百五十公厘可以不受灾（1954年是三百公厘），主要干堤可以保证1954年大水不破，基本上消灭了一般水旱灾害。
    二、在积肥方面，桐城群众更表现了特出的干劲，现在全县已经积肥二十四亿多担，平均每亩肥料达到了三千担，全年计划达到积肥三十六亿余担，每亩平均达到四千五百担（第二季一千五百担）。由于每亩施肥已达到三千担，以致现在田土都比原来高二寸。群众反映是：杂肥三千担，见田长二寸，保证超千斤。原来许多群众认为无肥可积，现在他们都反映说：“肥料到处有，就怕不动手”，他们对于积肥已是信心百倍了。今年积肥如此之多，完全是在发动了群众，大家千方百计找肥源的情况下才实现的。桐城找到的肥源有四十多种，为了普遍挖掘肥源，他们提出的办法是：“家家牛尾灶，丘丘田头窖，还加一个行军灶”，群众根据自己积肥经验，总结起来是“积肥没有巧，十字要记牢：烧、熏、挖、换、扫，铲、沤、堆、拾、捞”。烧即是烧包子、烧土窑、烧锅心土；熏是牛尾灶行军灶；挖是挖塘泥，挖阴沟泥，挖厕所、牛栏、猪圈底子，挖老屋基墩，在新店乡挖肥中挖出了一条两里路长的相传还是三国时候的古代街道，不仅积了肥，还挖出了许多金、银、财宝和古物；换是换锅台土，换陈墙壁土，换陈屋草，家土换野土；扫是扫垃圾，扫墙上屋上烟燎灰，家里家外、牛猪圈都勤打扫；铲是铲草皮，铲脚板泥，铲墙壁；沤是打青草，沤绿肥，沤水粪；堆是用青草皮加石灰做堆肥；拾是拾野粪，拾杂粪；捞是捞塘泥，捞水草。此外还普遍推广制造颗粒肥料、细菌肥料、人造尿等。在积了大量肥料之后，立即出现了运肥任务大，时间紧，劳力不足的困难。我们克服这一困难的主要办法是创造和改进运肥工具，创造了牛车、平车、土车，实现车子化，创造了滑车空运，利用沟渠用斛桶水运，共制作工具四万余件。原计划五十至六十天才能把肥料送完，经过工具改革，提高效率之后，十五至二十天即送完了。还减少劳力两万余人。根据过去几年增施肥料改良土壤的经验，如以去年每亩增施肥料六百担可以增产粮食四十斤计算，则今年比去年肥料增加了六倍，每亩即约可增产粮食二百四十斤，全县可增产粮食一亿八千万斤。
    三、改进耕作技术方面，根据桐城过去两年的试验，三、六寸条栽密植比一般六七寸见方的稀植要增产30％左右，有的达到增产67％。群众总结密植好处是：“三、六寸就是好，山、圩区都能搞，穗子多，粒子饱，根根成林子头少，出得齐，黄得早，能耐旱，少长草，能耐肥，倒不了，多收粮，多收草，紧紧抓住这件宝，一亩千斤跑不掉”。这次全县对密植经验进行了总结，向群众作了教育，办了训练班，选拔插秧能手，并且创造与推广了直行器和插秧船，全面推广了三、六密植。并用点多、面少的办法试验二五及三脚棵密植。为明年能否进一步密植作准备。根据过去两年经验，如以密植增产30％计算，每亩要增产二百四十斤，全县增产约达一亿七千二百万斤。
    四、扩大复种面积和高产作物，大面积推广了双季稻。双季稻由去年的三十二万亩，扩大到今年的四十七万亩，占全县水稻田的73.4％。根据过去几年经验，双季稻增产是有保证的。在旱地采取三季连作，实行种高产作物、密植深耕、增施肥料、间种玉米等措施，要求赶上水田产量。还采取各种措施加强了田间管理。由于采取了这些措施，估计扩大二十五万亩面积，其中扩大午季及春性作物十万亩，每亩可以增产二百斤，共可增产二千一百万斤；双季稻扩大十五万亩，每亩约可增产三百斤，共可增产四千五百万斤；扩大山芋二万亩折合原粮每亩约可增产五百斤，共可增产一千万斤。以上合计增产约为七千六百万斤。
    根据最近几个月来农业生产大跃进的发展情况和初步计算，1958年在1957年的四亿五千万斤的产量基础上，可能增产粮食四亿四千二百万斤，合计即达八亿九千二百万斤，每亩平均产量可达一千二百五十斤。假定由于某些措施不能实现或遭遇水旱灾害时，减少三亿斤（1954年大水灾减产一亿六千万斤）产量计算，亦可保持五亿九千二百万斤，即仍可以达到每亩产量一千斤左右。因此，我们完全有信心实现1958年的粮食增产计划指标，同时，我们也坚信1958年全国农业生产大跃进的结果，必将更彻底的粉碎一切右倾保守思想，必将促使今后出现更大的农业生产大跃进的高潮。
