　　Portuguese Silhouette

　　In order to conceal the corruption and backwardness under its cruel fascist rule, the Salazar government of Portugal has implemented strict press censorship and enacted many unprecedented decrees. For example, any Portuguese person who guides foreign tourists to visit slum areas will be sentenced to eight years in prison.

　　Recently, the Portuguese government announced a new decree strictly prohibiting farmers from appearing barefoot in tourist areas. Since most farmers cannot afford shoes, this decree is tantamount to prohibiting farmers from entering and leaving tourist areas.

　　Of course, these scandals cannot be covered up.

　　A recent article published in the American "Mainstream" monthly pointed out that two thousand large landowners in Portugal have regained the privileges they were deprived of when the republic was established in 1910.

　　Portuguese colonial trading companies have purchased patents from the government in many areas such as import and export trade and mining. Portuguese generals, Salazar's cronies, and bureaucrats are holders of huge amounts of stock, and the Catholic Church is the largest shareholder in Portugal. The Catholic Jesuit Order controls Portugal's hydroelectric power industry, and the Catholic Dominican Order controls Portugal's cement market.

　　"Mainstream" monthly stated that from 1928 to 1958, the salaries of Portuguese government cabinet members increased fivefold in thirty years. The treatment of general civil servants increased twofold. However, the wages of the working people increased very little, and some remained unchanged. For example, the wages of salt mine workers in Alcochete in 1928 were about US$0.53 per day. The price of salt has risen twelvefold in the last thirty years, but the wages of salt mine workers remain unchanged to this day. Due to rising prices, the real wages of the working people have been greatly reduced.

　　In an article titled "The Dark Side of the Salazar Regime," John Stone, a reporter for the British "New Statesman" magazine, described the difficult situation of the vast majority of residents of Portugal. He said that residents in the suburbs of Porto, the second largest city in Portugal, live in "dark little huts made of boxes, planks, old iron sheets, and even cardboard. The floor is the soil. In winter, these people live in mud like primitive tribes. The children are almost naked, exposing their bloated bellies from drinking potato porridge, which is their staple food." The reporter pointed out that these slums are a very common phenomenon in Portugal. (Leshan) (Attached picture)

### 葡萄牙剪影

　　葡萄牙剪影
    葡萄牙的萨拉查政府为了掩盖残酷的法西斯统治下的腐败和落后面貌，实行了严格的新闻封锁，制定了许多史无前例的法令，例如：任何指引外国游客参观贫民住宅区的葡萄牙人，将被判处有期徒刑八年。
    最近，葡萄牙政府又公布了一项新的法令，严禁农民赤脚在外国游客游览区出现。由于大多数农民买不起鞋子，这项法令等于禁止农民出入游览区。
    当然，这种丑行是遮盖不住的。
    美国“主流”月刊最近发表的一篇文章指出，葡萄牙两千个大地主恢复了1910年共和国成立时被褫夺的特权。
    葡萄牙的殖民地贸易公司向政府购买了进出口贸易、矿业等许多方面的专利权。葡萄牙的将军们、萨拉查的党羽、官僚都是巨额股票的持有人，而天主教教会就是葡萄牙最大的股东。天主教耶稣会控制了葡萄牙水力发电工业，天主教多米尼加教派掌握了葡萄牙的水泥市场。
    “主流”月刊称，从1928年至1958年，三十年间葡萄牙政府的阁员们的薪金增加了五倍。一般公教人员的待遇增加了两倍。而劳动人民的工资增加得极少，有的原封未动，例如阿尔科西特地方的盐坑工人，1928年的工资每人每日约合美金五角三分，三十年以来盐价上涨了十二倍，可是盐坑工人的工资直到今天还是一成未变。由于物价上涨，劳动人民的实际工资已经大大减少。
    英国“新政治家”杂志记者约翰斯登在一篇题为“萨拉查政权的阴暗面”的文章里，描写了葡萄牙绝大多数居民的困难处境。他说，葡萄牙第二大都市奥波尔托近郊居民住的是一种“用板箱、木板、旧铁皮、甚至用纸板搭成的黑漆漆的小茅屋。地板就是泥土。冬天，这些人像原始部落一样，可以说是在泥潭里生活。小孩子差不多都是赤身裸体的、露出因为喝马铃薯稀粥而胀得大大的肚子，这种马铃薯稀粥就是他们的主食。”记者指出，这些贫民窟是葡萄牙极普通的现象。（乐山）（附图片）
