Xinhua News Agency, June 15th -- Western news agencies recently reported from Belgrade: Arrests have recently occurred in the Yugoslav capital and provinces. Those arrested include senior government officials, responsible cadres of the Party, and university students. They were arrested on charges of opposing the current policies of the Yugoslav authorities and engaging in "hostile propaganda."

During this period, some Yugoslavs also fled the country.

According to the Yugoslav News Agency, Petric, a spokesman for the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, confirmed at a press conference on the 13th that several Yugoslavs had been arrested in recent days.

Petric said that on May 31st, ten people, including V. Dapcevic (the younger brother of P. Dapcevic, a member of the Yugoslav Federal Executive Council and Secretary-General of the Secretariat of Transportation), fled Yugoslavia. These people had been detained after 1948 for supporting the Cominform resolution. The spokesman then said that the internal security organs have arrested several people and have begun criminal investigations against them because they prepared for the escape of the aforementioned group or participated in their "harmful" activities, and had previously been sentenced for engaging in "hostile activities."

    南斯拉夫首都和各省
    最近都发生逮捕事件
    被捕者的罪名是反对南当局现行政策
    新华社15日讯　据西方通讯社最近几天自贝尔格莱德报道：最近在南斯拉夫首都和各省都发生了逮捕事件。被捕的人有政府高级官员和党的负责干部和大学生等。他们被逮捕的罪名是反对南斯拉夫当局的现行政策和进行“敌对的宣传”。
    在此期间，还有一些南斯拉夫人逃出国境。
    据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人彼得里奇13日在记者招待会上证实这些天来曾经有若干南斯拉夫人被逮捕。
    彼得里奇说，在5月31日一天里，包括符·达普切维奇（南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会委员、交通运输秘书处秘书长彼·达普切维奇的弟弟）在内的十个人逃出了南斯拉夫。这些人在1948年后曾经因为拥护情报局决议而被拘捕过。这个发言人接着说，在这以后，内政机关已经逮捕了若干人，并且已经开始对他们进行刑事侦讯，因为他们为上述那批人逃走进行准备工作、或者参与他们的“为害”活动，并曾一度由于进行“敌对活动”而被判刑。
