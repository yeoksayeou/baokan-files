Ideological Commentary

    We must break down the superstition that the present is not as good as the past, and the later generations are not as good as the former generations. Those who advocate this kind of superstition fly the flag of "valuing the ancient and belittling the present." They also attack us as "despising the past and being blindly optimistic about the future." Indeed, different views on the past and the future are a fundamental difference between revolutionaries and conservatives, dialectical materialism and idealism. Therefore, it is necessary for us to discuss this issue clearly.
    We believe that everything has its occurrence, development, and demise. All old things will always be replaced by new things, and surpassed by new things. "In history, the latecomer always surpasses the earlycomer, and the seemingly weak, progressive, and nascent things always defeat those seemingly powerful, conservative, and dying things." (Liu Shaoqi: Work Report of the Central Committee of the CPC to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.) Although the socialist system has only been around for a few decades, it will surely replace and surpass the capitalist system, which has been around for hundreds of years. The Soviet Union will surely surpass the United States, and China will surely surpass the United Kingdom. The industrialization that capitalist countries have achieved in one or two hundred years will be achieved by our socialist New China in the shortest time in history. This is also true for people. Every day, a large number of newly born cells replace a large number of dead cells in the human body. Later generations inherit the experience and knowledge of their predecessors, and then create and develop them, thus surpassing their predecessors. Because of this, society can continue to advance, and humanity has hope. Therefore, we revolutionaries, dialectical materialists, believe that the future must be better than the past. From this point of view, we can also be called "despising the past and being blindly optimistic about the future."
    The latecomer surpasses the earlycomer! In the eyes of the old moralists, this is an abnormal phenomenon. They say, "Is that acceptable? If the son surpasses the father, and the apprentice surpasses the master, wouldn't the world be in chaos?" The old moralists think they know history best. In fact, they are the most ignorant of history. Because a large number of historical facts show that the latecomer surpassing the earlycomer is precisely the most normal phenomenon. Look: During the time of Yao, Gun was executed for failing to control the floods, but his son was ordered to control the floods and succeeded in calming them. Shun later abdicated to him. Sima Tan was a historian in the Han Dynasty, but it was his son Sima Qian, who inherited his career, who made achievements in history and became the first great historian in our history. Li Mi of the Later Wei Dynasty initially worshiped Kong Fan as his teacher, but after a few years, Kong Fan asked Li Mi to be his teacher. "The blue comes from the indigo plant but is bluer than it," is a story that has been passed down as a good story. Aristotle was a student of Plato, the master of ancient Greek idealism, but he criticized Plato's idealistic theory of Forms and made significant contributions to ancient Greek philosophy and science. Which of these examples is not a case of the latecomer surpassing the earlycomer? As for the examples of young people doing great things, there are even more. During the Warring States period, there was Gan Luo in the State of Qin, who became a plenipotentiary ambassador to the State of Zhao at the age of twelve and solved major problems, returning to become a high-ranking official of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. In the Han Dynasty, there was Jia Yi, who was known for his ability to recite poems and write articles at the age of eighteen, and became a tutor at the age of twenty-something. Xiang Yu raised an army to resist the Qin army at the age of twenty-four and won every battle. During the Jin Dynasty, when Xiangcheng was besieged, Xun Guan, the thirteen-year-old daughter of the prefect, led dozens of warriors, broke through the siege at night, brought in reinforcements, and relieved the siege. It was like this in ancient times, and in our socialist era of heroes, it is even more common for sons to surpass their fathers, young people to surpass the old, younger sisters to surpass older brothers, and people with less knowledge to surpass those with more knowledge. Today, many outstanding township and commune cadres are young people. Among the advanced figures who take the lead in creating new records and innovating technology, a large number are also young people. As for the latecomers catching up with the advanced, there are even more countless examples. In fact, our movement to compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced can, in a sense, be called a latecomer surpassing the earlycomer movement. The laggards catch up with the advanced, and the original advanced, who have been overtaken, catch up again. The waves of the Yangtze River push the waves ahead, and later generations surpass the former generations. This has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so today. Isn't it so?
    However, there are still some people who have been poisoned by superstition. In addition to being superstitious about "foreign" (foreigners, foreign books, foreign goods, studying abroad, etc.), they are also superstitious about "old" and "ancient." Some people regard the old bourgeois professors and experts as "unsurpassable geniuses" and regard them as their "highest goal," saying that "it is enough to learn one-tenth," and even think that their speech and walking are "extraordinary," with a sense of "being far beyond reach." Some people regard ancient history as "a pot of strong tea," while modern history is "a glass of plain water." Some people only read classical works of literature and despise modern works. People who adopt a slavish worship and imitation of their predecessors will certainly not be able to surpass their predecessors, but will only be "worse from generation to generation." These people do not understand that all experience, knowledge, and learning come from practice. Today, since we have such a vigorous and great practice, our experience, knowledge, and learning today must greatly exceed those of our predecessors. The disconnection between theory and practice is the fatal weakness of many old bourgeois professors and experts. Their dead knowledge is limited and often untenable. On the contrary, the liberated workers and peasants who have grown up from actual struggles, although their book knowledge is not as much as that of the old professors and experts, are the creators of new knowledge, new science, new technology, and true and major ones. The examples of "native experts" Li Shimei, Zhou Nanxing, Cai Zuquan, Wang Baojing, and Zhou Hanhua vividly prove this point. No matter how high the skills of bourgeois experts are, they can only produce hundreds of thousands of tons of steel in old China, while the output of steel in our New China will not only reach more than seven million tons today, but will also reach tens of millions of tons, and hundreds of millions of tons in the future. Shi Nai'an wrote only about the 108 heroes of Liangshanbo, but how many heroes of our era are there, more than thousands or tens of thousands? Their moving deeds cannot be recorded by the 120 chapters of "Water Margin." Can't we predict that the greatest and most outstanding works of China will not be written by the ancients of the old society, but by the present people of the socialist era? Taking a superstitious attitude towards our predecessors is just a sign of lack of ambition. Mr. Lu Xun said it well: "Descendants should change the affairs of their ancestors. 'It can be called filial piety if one does not change the way of the father in three years,' is of course a distorted saying and the root of infantile regression. If the ancient single-celled animals had followed this teaching, they would never have dared to split and complex, and there would never have been human beings in the world." Everyone knows that Confucius was a great scholar, but if he were to be the president of our Academy of Sciences today, then we would not be able to sit in "Dongfeng" brand cars or jet planes, but only in the car he rode when he traveled around the countries. It should be seen that the true history of human society only begins in our era.
    Because the latecomer surpassing the earlycomer is the law of development of everything, the Communist Party, which is fighting for the beautiful future of mankind, always attaches great importance to the role of young people. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that youth is the most active and vital force in the entire society. This is especially true in the socialist era. However, young people were despised and had no status in the old society. Their enthusiasm and creativity were always suppressed in every way, so they always encountered many obstacles if they wanted to make contributions to society. Only in the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party are young people valued and have their due status. In our new society, all the predecessors with communist consciousness and noble ideas always care for the growth of the younger generation in every possible way. They impart their experience and knowledge to our young people without reservation. They regard the ability of the younger generation to inherit them and surpass them as their greatest happiness. Today, we young people who live in such a beautiful socialist era, shouldn't we have grand ambitions and make greater contributions than people of any era in history?
    Of course, when we say that the latecomer surpasses the earlycomer, we do not mean that the young will necessarily surpass the old, nor that any kind of young people can be called a new force. To become a new force in society, he must first be a representative and promoter of new things. Some right-wing elements call themselves "innovators" and "new forces," but they are only using the name of "innovators" to summon spirits for the dead, and what they are actively promoting is the garbage of revisionism, and what they represent are dying things, and they have nothing in common with the new forces we are talking about. Our young people must first learn to distinguish the wind direction, to know whether it is the east wind or the west wind blowing, and then decide on their actions. The most fundamental way to distinguish the wind direction is to understand the people, to understand the wishes of our 600 million people. Only those who truly represent the will of the broad masses of the people are the representatives of new things and the new forces in society. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, correctly reflects the greatest interests and urgent demands of our 600 million people. Therefore, specifically speaking, if we want to learn to distinguish the wind direction today, we must learn to resolutely implement the Party's general line in all our actions. We know that there have also been many examples of "tiger fathers and dog sons" in history. It can be seen that if the latecomers do not work hard, they will also fall behind their predecessors.
    Only "the blue comes from the indigo plant" can "surpass the indigo plant." To surpass our predecessors, we must learn from our predecessors. Lenin taught us that "only by enriching our minds with all the treasures of knowledge created by mankind can we become communists." Without the foundation of the experience and knowledge of our predecessors, talking about surpassing our predecessors is just empty talk. Learning from our predecessors with an open mind is the prerequisite for surpassing them. There are two different attitudes to learning. One is a dogmatic attitude, that is, we do whatever our predecessors say, and we dare not change it at all. With this attitude to learning, not to mention that we cannot surpass our predecessors, but it will also cause damage to our cause. Because things are always developing forward, and copying the experience of our predecessors unchanged will inevitably conflict with reality. The other is a creative attitude to learning, that is, not only must we humbly absorb all the successful and useful experience and knowledge of our predecessors, but we must also dare to criticize the erroneous or outdated experience and knowledge of our predecessors, and dare to further create new experience and acquire knowledge in practice. Obviously, we are in favor of the latter attitude to learning. So, should we recognize authority? Then we must first see what kind of authority it is, proletarian authority or bourgeois authority; is it true authority or false authority. Of course, we should respect the authority that represents the truth, which is what our revolutionary cause needs. However, respect does not mean superstition. We know that once authority is divorced from the masses, does not pay attention to learning from the masses, and deviates from the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, its thinking may become rigid. On the contrary, young people with less experience and less dogma, but less knowledge, can often quickly see the truth and grasp the truth. Moreover, the time when authority is formed is not always when one is gray-haired and has read ten thousand books. Marx and Engels were only twenty-nine years old when they co-authored the "Communist Manifesto." As for bourgeois authority and false authority, of course, we should overthrow them without hesitation. Can we admit that "experts" who research what "whether Wang Xifeng has big feet or small feet" and "whether Yang Guifei was a virgin when she entered the palace" are the authority we need? In the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, the proletariat has achieved a decisive victory on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front. However, on the scientific, technical, and cultural fronts, the bourgeoisie is still "hoarding rare goods," scaring the workers and peasants, and using the fields of science, technology, and culture as the last position for them to occupy. Therefore, breaking the superstition of bourgeois authority and seizing the last position of the bourgeoisie is not only necessary for the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, but also has great significance for the final victory of the socialist road. Therefore, do not be intimidated by authority, do not be intimidated by great scholars, but dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. With the leadership of the Party, as long as we distinguish the wind direction and grasp the truth, we must go forward bravely and be invincible.
    Some comrades are worried that advocating the latecomer surpassing the earlycomer will make young people proud. Of course, we are against young people being proud. But think about it, is it better for our cause if the broad masses of young people hold a superstitious attitude towards their predecessors, and therefore dare not think, dare not do, and dare not create? Or is it better for our cause if they dare to think, dare to do, and dare to create? It is true that some young people, in the process of daring to think and do, and after making some achievements, may become a little proud and stumble. But what is so scary about that? Some young people stumble because of arrogance and self-importance, which can be a lesson for them. For the broad masses of young people, there is also a negative teaching material, which can help them understand the importance of humility. Moreover, as long as we explain the principles clearly, pride can be prevented. Advocating the latecomer surpassing the earlycomer is to make young people realize their responsibilities and work harder, rather than saying that young people have any reason to be proud. The latecomer surpassing the earlycomer is just fulfilling our historical responsibility. We are developing on the basis of the experience and knowledge of our predecessors, and later generations will surpass us in the future. This is like a relay race, and there is nothing to be proud of in itself. Arrogance and self-importance are just a sign of ignorance. Our slogan is: humbly learn from our predecessors, and bravely surpass our predecessors.
    "To count the outstanding figures, we must look to the present." Heroes of the socialist era, as long as the direction is correct, bravely break through the waves and move forward!

    后来者居上
    钟沛璋
    我们必须破除这样一种迷信，就是今人不及古人，后人不及前人。主张这种迷信的人，他们所打的旗帜就是：“厚古薄今”。他们还攻击我们是：“卑视既往，迷信将来”。的确，对既往和将来的不同看法，是革命派和保守派、辩证唯物主义和唯心主义的一个根本分歧。因此我们有必要对这个问题讨论清楚。
    我们认为一切事物都有它的发生、发展和灭亡。一切旧事物总要被新事物所代替，并且被新事物所超过。“在历史上，永远是后来者居上，永远是暂时显得弱小的、代表进步方面的、新生的事物战胜那些表面上似乎强大的、代表保守方面的、趋向死亡的事物。”（刘少奇：中共中央向八大二次会议的工作报告。）社会主义制度虽然还只有几十年的历史，但是它必定要代替并且超过已经有了几百年历史的资本主义制度。苏联一定要超过美国，中国一定要超过英国。资本主义国家用一、二百年时间才达到的工业化，我们社会主义的新中国将用历史上最短的时间就达到它。这对人来说也是如此。人的身体，每天都有大量新生的细胞，代替大量死亡的细胞。后人继承了前人的经验、知识，再加以创造和发展，就会超过前人。正因为这样，社会才能不断前进，人类才有希望。因此，我们革命派、辩证唯物主义者是相信将来一定要比以往美好。从这点来说，我们也可以称之为是“卑视既往，迷信将来”的。
    后来者居上！这在旧道学论者看来是反常的现象，他们说：“那还了得吗？儿子要超过老子，徒弟要超过师傅，天下不是乱了吗？”旧道学论者自以为是最懂得历史的。其实，他们对历史是最无知的。因为大量的历史事实说明，后来居上恰恰是最正常的现象。试看：尧时鲧治水无功被处死，他的儿子又奉命治水，结果洪水悉平，舜后来还禅位与他。司马谈是汉朝的史官，但是，在史学上做出成就，成为我国历史上第一个伟大的史学家的，却是继承他事业的他的儿子司马迁。后魏李谧开始时拜孔璠为师，数年后，反过来孔璠请李谧为师。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，世人传为佳话。亚里斯多德是古希腊唯心主义大师柏拉图的学生，但是他却批判了柏拉图唯心主义的理念理论，对古希腊的哲学和科学作出了重大贡献。这些例子，哪个不是后来居上？至于青年干大事的事例，那就更多了。战国时秦国有个甘罗，十二岁当了全权大使到赵国解决了大问题，回来当了秦始皇的上卿。汉朝有个贾谊，十八岁就以能诵诗属文闻名，二十几岁就当了太傅。项羽二十四岁起兵反抗秦军，九战皆捷。晋朝襄城被围，太守的小女儿荀灌只十三岁，率勇士数十，突围夜出，搬来救兵，解了重围。古代如此，在我们英雄辈出的社会主义时代，儿子比过老子，青年比过老年，妹妹比过哥哥，学问少的人比过学问多的人，更是处处皆是。现在许多优秀的乡干部、社干部都是青年。在带头创造新纪录革新技术的先进人物中，大量的也是青年。至于后进者赶过先进者，更是数不清了。事实上，我们的比先进、赶先进运动，在某种意义上说也可以称之为后来居上运动。落后者赶过先进者，被人赶过的原来的先进者，又再重新赶上去。长江后浪推前浪，世上后人胜前人，自古已然，于今为烈，难道不是这样吗？
    但是，仍旧还有一些人中了迷信之毒。他们除了迷信“洋”（洋人、洋书、洋货、留洋等）之外，还迷信“旧”和“古”。有人把资产阶级旧教授、旧专家，看成是“不可超越的天才”，把他们当作是自己的“最高奋斗目标”，说什么“只要学到十分之一就够了”，甚至认为他们说话、走路都是“非凡”的，大有“望尘莫及”之感。有人把古代史看成是“一壶浓茶”，现代史则是“一杯白开水”。有人对文学作品则是非古典不读，藐视现代作品。这种对前人采取奴隶式的崇拜和模仿的人，当然是谈不到后来居上的，而只会“一代不如一代”。这些人不了解，一切的经验、知识和学问都是从实践中来的。今天我们既然有如此轰轰烈烈的伟大的实践，我们今天的经验、知识和学问，也一定要大大地超过前人。理论与实际的脱节是许多资产阶级旧教授、旧专家的致命的弱点。他们的一些死知识是有限的，而且是常常站不住脚的。相反的，获得了解放的、从实际斗争中成长起来的工农，他们的书本知识虽然没有旧教授、旧专家多，但是他们却是新知识、新科学、新技术和真正的、主要的创造者。“土专家”李始美、周南兴、蔡祖泉、王保京、周汉华等人的事例，就生动地证明了这点。资产阶级专家的本领再高，他们也只不过使旧中国年产几十万吨钢，而我们新中国钢的产量不但今天要达到七百多万吨，而且以后还要达到几千万吨，上万万吨。施耐庵所写的只是梁山泊的一百零八个好汉，而我们这个时代的英雄好汉又何止是几千、几万？他们可歌可泣的伟大事迹，又何尝是一百二十回的“水浒传”所能记载的。难道我们不能够预言：中国最伟大、最杰出的作品并不是由旧社会的古人写成的，而将是社会主义时代的今人写成的？对前人采取迷信的态度，只是一种没出息的表现。鲁迅先生说得好：“子孙对祖先的事应该改变，‘三年无改父道可谓孝矣’，当然是曲说，是退婴的病根。假使古代的单细胞动物，也遵着这教训，那便永远不敢分裂繁复，世界上再也不会有人类了。”人们都知道，孔夫子是一个大学问家，但是如果让他来做我们今天的科学院院长，那么我们就别想坐什么“东风牌”小汽车、喷气式飞机，而只能坐他周游列国时所坐的车了。应该看到，真正的人类社会的历史，从我们这个时代才是开始。
    正因为后来居上是一切事物发展的规律，因此为争取人类美好未来而斗争的共产党，总是十分重视青年的作用。我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出，青年是整个社会力量中的一支最积极、最有生气的力量。在社会主义时代尤其是这样。但是，青年在旧社会里却是被轻视的，是没有地位的。他们的积极性和创造性总是受到种种压抑，因此他们要想为社会作出些贡献，也总是要遇到重重的阻挠。只有在共产党领导下的新社会里，青年才受到了重视，才有了自己应有的地位。在我们新社会中，所有具有共产主义觉悟和崇高思想的前辈们，总是无微不至地关怀着年轻一代的成长。他们把他们的经验和知识无保留地传授给我们青年。他们把年轻一代能够继承他们并且超过他们，看成是自己最大的幸福。今天我们生活在这样美好的社会主义时代的青年，难道不应该抱有宏图大略，比历史上任何时代的人做出更大的贡献来吗？
    当然，我们说后来居上，并不是说年轻的就一定会超过年老的，也不是说，任何样子的青年都可以称之为新生力量。要成为社会中的新生力量，他首先必须是新生事物的代表者和促进者。有些右派分子以“革新者”、“新生力量”自居，但是他们不过是假借“革新者”之名，为死尸招魂，他们所积极推销的是修正主义的垃圾，他们所代表的是趋向死亡的事物，和我们所说的新生力量，毫无共同之点。我们青年首先要学会辨风向，要懂得刮的是东风还是西风，然后来决定自己的行动。辨风向的最根本的方法，就是要了解人民，要了解我们六亿人民的愿望。只有真正地代表了广大人民的意志的人，才是新生事物的代表者，才是社会中的新生力量。党的八届二次大会所制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是正确地反映了我国六亿人民的最大利益和迫切要求。因此，具体来说，我们今天要学会辨风向，也就是要学会在一切行动中坚决地贯彻党的这条总路线。我们知道，在历史上也有不少“虎父犬子”的例子。可见如果后人不努力，也同样会落后于前人。
    只有“青出于蓝”才能“胜于蓝”。要超过前人，就必须学习前人。列宁教导我们“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者”。离开了前人的经验和知识的基础，去谈什么超过前人，那只是一种空话。虚心地学习前人，是超过前人的前提。学习，有两种不同的态度。一种是教条主义的态度，就是前人怎么说，我们就怎么做，一点也不敢改动。抱着这种学习态度，莫说不能超过前人，而且还会对我们的事业造成损害。因为事物总是在不断向前发展，一成不变地搬用前人的经验，必然会与现实发生矛盾。另一种是创造性的学习态度，就是不但要虚心地吸取前人一切成功的、有用的经验和知识，而且还要敢于批判前人错误的、或者过时的经验和知识，敢于在实践中进一步去创造新的经验和获得知识。显然，我们是赞成后一种的学习态度。那么，要不要承认权威呢？那我们先要看看是什么样的权威，是无产阶级权威，还是资产阶级权威；是真权威，还是假权威。是代表着真理的权威，当然我们是应该尊重的，这是我们革命事业所需要的。但是，尊重不等于迷信。我们知道，权威一旦脱离了群众，不注意向群众学习，离开了辩证唯物主义的观点，思想便可能僵化起来。相反的，既少经验，又少教条的学问较少的青年，却往往能够迅速看到真理，并且抓住真理。而且，权威形成的时候，也并不都是在白发苍苍，读破万卷书的时候。马克思和恩格斯一起写成“共产党宣言”的时候，才二十九岁。至于资产阶级的权威、假权威当然我们应该毫不犹豫地加以推翻。难道我们能够承认考证什么“王熙凤是大脚还是小脚”、“杨贵妃入宫时是否是处女”这样的“专家”是我们所需要的权威？在资本主义与社会主义的两条道路的斗争中，无产阶级在经济战线上、政治战线上、思想战线上，已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是在科学、技术和文化战线上，资产阶级还在“奇货可居”，吓唬工农，把科学、技术和文化的领域，作为他们盘踞的最后阵地。因此打破对资产阶级权威的迷信，夺取资产阶级的最后阵地，这不仅是技术革命和文化革命所必须，而且对社会主义道路的最后胜利有着巨大的意义。因此，不要被权威吓倒，不要被大学问家吓倒，而要敢想、敢说、敢做。有了党的领导，只要我们辨清风向，抓住真理，就要一往直前，所向披靡。
    有一些同志担心提倡后来居上，会使青年骄傲起来。当然，我们是反对青年人骄傲的。但是请想一想，是广大青年对前人抱着迷信的态度，因而不敢想，不敢做，不敢创造，这样对我们的事业好呢？还是敢想，敢做，敢创造这样对我们的事业好呢？诚然，会有一些青年，在敢想敢作当中和做出一些成绩之后，可能要来点骄傲，跌点跤子。但是这又有什么可怕的呢？有些青年因为骄傲自大跌了跤子，这对他们本人来说，可以从中记取教训。对于广大青年来说，也有了教育的反面材料，可以懂得谦虚的重要。何况，只要我们把道理讲清楚，骄傲是可以防止的。提倡后来居上，是要青年认识到自己的责任，加倍地去努力，而不是说青年有了什么可以骄傲的理由。后来居上只是尽了我们应尽的历史责任。我们是在前人的经验、知识基础上加以发展，而且，将来后人又会超过我们。这就像接力赛跑一样，本身是没有什么骄傲可言的。狂妄自大，只是一种无知的表现。我们的口号是：虚心地学习前人，勇敢地超过前人。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”社会主义时代的英雄们，只要方向正确，就勇敢地破浪前进吧！
