Implementing the Party's Nationalities Policy and Vigorously Train Ethnic Minority Cadres
Xinjiang's Ethnic Minority Cadres are Growing Rapidly
Currently, the Focus is on Strengthening Education to Gradually Communize Cadres

Urumqi Dispatch from Our Newspaper (Reporter Wang An): Under the vigorous cultivation of Party committees at all levels, the ranks of ethnic minority cadres in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are growing rapidly. At present, the autonomous region and its subordinate autonomous prefectures and counties have promoted a large number of ethnic minority cadres. The entire autonomous region has more than 62,000 ethnic minority cadres from Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, Manchu, Tatar, Tajik, Uzbek, Russian, Daur, and Xibe ethnic groups, accounting for 53.64% of the total number of cadres in Xinjiang. Among them, more than 1,300 are at or above the county level. Ethnic minority cadres account for nearly 52% of the members of Party committees at all levels, and ethnic minority cadres account for nearly 70% of county heads and deputy county heads. More than 65% of the main responsible persons of state power organs such as chairmen and vice-chairmen of the autonomous region, and governors, commissioners, and mayors of prefectures and cities are local ethnic minority cadres.

Xinjiang's ethnic minority cadres have grown rapidly since liberation. In the early days of liberation, there were about 12,000 ethnic minority cadres, less than one-fifth of the current number. More than 10,000 ethnic minority peasant activists who emerged during the land reform in rural areas in 1953 were promoted to cadres, and many of them have today assumed leadership positions above the county level. In particular, in 1956, after the establishment of the autonomous region, with the development of various tasks, the number of ethnic minority cadres increased by more than 70%. Many ethnic minority cadres were promoted exceptionally and across levels. In the past two years, 577 ethnic minority cadres have been promoted to positions at or above the county level, and 199 have been promoted across levels.

The rapid growth of ethnic minority cadres is a major achievement of Party committees at all levels in Xinjiang in resolutely implementing the Party's nationalities policy. First, Party committees at all levels attach importance to regularly educating cadres on nationalities policy and unity among cadres, examining and criticizing bourgeois nationalism, especially after the Second Xinjiang Party Congress in 1952 and the meetings thereafter. Xinjiang systematically and thoroughly examined and criticized Han chauvinism from top to bottom, laying the foundation for implementing the Party's nationalities policy and training ethnic minority cadres. Second, Party committees at all levels, starting from the specific situation in Xinjiang, grasped the policy of selecting cadres with both ability and integrity, and adopted the method of boldly promoting and using ethnic minority cadres. A considerable number of ethnic minority cadres who possessed certain conditions gradually became familiar with and competent in their work under the assistance of the Party committee after being promoted to new positions. Third, Party committees at all levels focused on political and ideological education and vigorously cultivated and trained ethnic minority cadres. Since liberation, more than 81,000 ethnic minority cadres (times) have studied in Party schools and cadre schools at all levels. Party committees at all levels have also universally educated cadres on basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, while attaching importance to sending cadres to participate in grassroots work for training and exercise. Each year, tens of thousands of ethnic minority cadres go to the grassroots to participate in central work, gradually improving the theoretical, policy and ideological levels, and practical work abilities of ethnic minority cadres.

Under the vigorous cultivation of the Party, ethnic minority cadres who have grown rapidly through the tempering of various democratic reforms and socialist revolutions have generally seen a rapid increase in their socialist consciousness. Most of them are competent in the positions they hold, are able to closely connect with the people of all ethnic groups, implement the Party and the people's government's various policies and instructions, and lead and organize the people of all ethnic groups to successfully complete the tasks of political, economic, and cultural construction. Bieken (Kazakh), Deputy Director of the Urumqi Municipal Personnel Bureau, Naman (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the Commercial Bureau, and others, waged a resolute struggle against the extreme local nationalist and class alien former mayor A. Said. Under A. Said's various harassments and attacks, they resolutely opposed and exposed A. Said's series of anti-Party and anti-people conspiracies to oppose the Party committee's leadership, exclude the Han nationality, and arbitrarily promote and place bad elements, safeguarding the interests of the Party. However, due to Xinjiang's historical conditions, since liberation, there has been more education on nationalities policy than class education among cadres. A large number of ethnic minority cadres who have grown rapidly have had a short period of Party education, and their actual work experience is not yet sufficient. The Marxist-Leninist class viewpoint and policy and ideological level of a considerable number of people cannot fully catch up with the needs of the development of various construction undertakings in Xinjiang. In response to this situation, Party committees at all levels in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have strengthened the education of cadres, focusing on class education and the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint on nationalities. On the good foundation of having basically realized the ethnicization of cadres, they are vigorously cultivating and improving cadres to gradually achieve communization.

    贯彻党的民族政策　大力培养民族干部
    新疆各民族干部迅速成长
    目前着重加强教育，使干部逐步共产主义化
    本报乌鲁木齐电　记者王安报道：新疆维吾尔自治区各民族干部队伍，正在各级党委大力培养下飞速成长起来，目前，自治区及所属自治州、县已经提拔了大量的少数民族干部，全自治区共有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、蒙古、柯尔克孜、满、塔塔尔、塔吉克、乌孜别克、俄罗斯、达斡尔、锡伯等民族干部六万二千多名，占新疆干部总数的53.64％，其中县级以上干部有一千三百多名。中共各级党委委员中，民族干部占将近52％，县长、副县长中民族干部占了将近70％，自治区主席、副主席和州长、专员、市长等政权机关主要负责人，65％以上都是本地民族干部。
    新疆民族干部是解放以后才迅速成长起来的。解放初期民族干部约有一万二千多人，还不到目前人数的五分之一。1953年农村进行土地改革中涌现的各族农民积极分子一万多人都被提拔为干部，其中不少人今天已担负了县以上的领导职务。特别是自治区成立后1956年一年中，随着各项工作的开展，民族干部就增加了70％以上，许多民族干部都是破格、越级提拔，近两年来提拔县级以上民族干部五百七十七名，越级提拔的就有一百九十九名。
    民族干部的飞跃成长，是新疆各级党委坚决贯彻执行党的民族政策取得的重大成就。首先，各级党委重视经常向干部进行民族政策、干部团结的教育，检查和批判资产阶级民族主义思想，特别是1952年新疆第二届党代表会议及会议以后，在新疆从上而下系统地、深入地检查和批判了大汉族主义思想，为贯彻党的民族政策、培养民族干部打下了基础。其次，各级党委从新疆具体情况出发掌握德才兼备的干部政策，对民族干部采取了放手提拔、使用的办法，有相当部分具备了一定条件的民族干部是在被提拔新职后，在党委帮助下才逐渐熟悉和胜任工作业务的。第三是各级党委抓紧政治思想教育，大力培养和训练民族干部。解放后，民族干部进各级党校、干部学校学习的达八万一千多人（次），各级党委并在干部中普遍进行了马列主义基础知识的教育，同时重视下放干部参加基层工作的培养和锻炼，每年都有上万名民族干部深入基层去参加中心工作，逐步提高了民族干部的理论、政策思想水平和实际工作能力。
    在党的大力培养下，经过各次民主改革和社会主义革命的锻炼飞跃成长起来的民族干部，绝大多数人的社会主义觉悟都有迅速的提高，一般都能胜任本身所担负的职务，能密切联系各族人民群众，贯彻执行党和人民政府的各项政策指示，领导和组织各族人民群众胜利完成了各项政治经济和文化建设的任务。乌鲁木齐市人事局副局长别肯（哈萨克族），商业局副局长纳曼（维吾尔族）等人，同极端地方民族主义者、阶级异己分子前市长阿·赛德进行了坚决的斗争，在阿·赛德的多方刁难和打击下，坚决反对并揭发了阿·赛德反对党委领导、排挤汉族、任意提拔和安置坏分子等一系列的反党反人民阴谋活动，维护了党的利益。但是，由于新疆的历史条件，解放以来在干部中进行民族政策的教育较多，阶级教育较少，大量飞跃成长起来的民族干部由于受党的教育时间短，在实际工作中锻炼也还不够，相当一部分人的马列主义阶级观点和政策思想水平还不能完全赶上新疆各项建设事业发展的需要。新疆维吾尔自治区各级党委针对这一情况，已加强对干部着重进行阶级教育和马列主义民族观点的教育，在已经基本实现了干部民族化的良好基础上，大力培养和提高干部逐步达到共产主义化。
