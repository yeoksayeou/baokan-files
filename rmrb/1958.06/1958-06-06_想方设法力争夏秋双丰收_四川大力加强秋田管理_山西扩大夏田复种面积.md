Strive for a Bumper Harvest in Both Summer and Autumn
    Sichuan Vigorously Strengthens Autumn Field Management; Shanxi Expands Summer Field Replanting Area

    (Our report) Chengdu – On the basis of a bumper harvest of spring crops, Sichuan is now experiencing another production upsurge across the province, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

    Currently, early and mid-season rice in Sichuan Province have entered the field management stage, and late rice has also been quickly sown. The planting area for early rice has reached 19 million mu, doubling that of last year.

    This production upsurge is being carried out under the inspiration of the Party Central Committee's General Line for socialist construction. In early May, following the bumper spring harvest, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's General Line, issued a call to the people of the province to leap forward again. Immediately, farmers across the province launched a vigorous production inspection movement. In the spirit of striving for excellence, agricultural cooperatives in various regions repeatedly studied and sought various methods to increase this year's grain production plans by every possible means. Many counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives proudly proposed plans to achieve "double thousand jin" (per-mu grain yield) and "double ten thousand jin" (sweet potato yield) this year. While planning, various regions took action, and within half a month, a production upsurge formed.

    Grasping the struggle to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and ensure full stands of seedlings, as well as strengthening field management of autumn-harvest crops, is an important aspect of this upsurge. The slogan in various regions is "Diligent inspection, diligent management, we must ensure the seedlings grow well and guarantee a bumper harvest in the spring." Many special districts, such as Luzhou and Nanchong, have generally formulated field management plans for agricultural cooperatives. The number of weeding and fertilization sessions and the amount of fertilizer applied have increased compared to last year, and preparations are being actively made to eliminate any pests. Since mid-May, due to temperature changes and insufficient fertilization, some early rice and corn seedlings in various regions have been growing poorly. Various regions have adopted measures such as weeding, applying additional fertilizer, and improving irrigation methods, and have successively launched movements to eliminate third-class seedlings. The Luzhou Special District mobilized one million people, working day and night, and in less than ten days, transformed tens of thousands of mu of third-class seedlings in the district.

    In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer supply for topdressing spring crops and preparing for winter sowing, various regions have successively launched a large-scale summer fertilizer accumulation campaign.

    Seizing the time to rush-plant sweet potatoes and expand the sweet potato planting area is another content of this production upsurge. According to the plan, the province will expand sweet potato cultivation by 5 million mu this year, which alone can increase grain production by 2 to 3 billion jin. Various regions have utilized all available vacant land, creating more than a dozen methods for expanding the area, such as "pile-pile sweet potatoes" and "mound-mound sweet potatoes," planting quickly, well, and in large quantities. The "pile-pile sweet potato" method (planting sweet potatoes by piling soil on the edges of fields, vacant land, and even roadsides) created by Rong County in the Neijiang Special District was promoted throughout the district within a few days. This method alone can expand the area by 350,000 mu, increasing grain production by at least 100 million jin. (Yu Jingqi)

    (Our report) Taiyuan – Shanxi Province is preparing to expand the summer replanting area to 9 million mu, striving to achieve a double harvest on one piece of land in summer and autumn. This reform, which transforms one crop a year into two crops a year or three crops in two years, is of decisive significance for completing this year's grain production tasks and for fully utilizing arable land potential and rationally using arable land in the future.

    Currently, this work is being carried out intensively in various regions as wheat is harvested and threshed. The vast majority of regions have formulated expansion replanting plans and started preparations early. Hongzhao, Xiaxian, and Hejin counties have prepared an average of 5,000 to 6,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of replanted land, and most of it has already been delivered to the fields. Various regions are stepping up preparations for seeds and tools, and conducting technical training. Agricultural cooperatives in Yongji and Ruicheng counties, where wheat is harvested earlier, have made overall arrangements for summer farming labor and fixed professional teams to carry out replanting immediately after the wheat harvest. Because various regions attach importance to this work, this year's replanting is generally characterized by early action, adequate preparation, rapid action, and ambitious planning. Jincheng County plans to summer plant all 410,000 mu of wheat fields; Linfen County's replanting plan has reached 70% of the wheat field area. According to the province's plan to replant 9 million mu, this year's replanting area accounts for about half of the province's suitable replanting area, exceeding any previous year. The output of replanted land in the province will reach one-tenth of the province's total output.

    Arable land suitable for replanting in Shanxi Province accounts for one-quarter of the province's arable land, but the replanting area in the past was very small. The experience of various regions in recent years has proven that there are many benefits to replanting: First, most wheat fields in Shanxi Province are planted once a year, resulting in "half a year of idleness." Using the idle time to plant another crop can increase grain production significantly in the same year. Second, it can alleviate the conflict between grain crops and cash crops. Implementing replanting in wheat fields creates conditions for crop rotation with cotton fields, which can not only increase cotton field yields but also expand cotton fields. Third, the main wheat-producing areas currently have a monotonous planting structure, making it difficult to obtain livestock feed and fertilizer, and the farmers' diet is also monotonous. Expanding replanting will play a significant role in solving feed, fertilizer, and improving farmers' lives.

    In 1955, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, after investigation, identified replanting as the key to increasing production in economic crop areas and vigorously promoted it, which achieved great results. However, in 1956, during the opposition to so-called "rash advances," many regions had the saying that "two seasons are not as good as one season," which greatly reduced the replanting area. Since last winter, various regions, through extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions in the rectification movement, have restored the reputation of this experience and listed it as a major measure to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture.

　　想方设法力争夏秋双丰收
    四川大力加强秋田管理　山西扩大夏田复种面积
    本报讯　四川在小春作物大丰收的基础上，一个力争秋季大丰收的生产高潮又在全省范围内形成。
    目前四川省早、中稻都已进入田间管理阶段，晚稻也抢播完毕，早稻播种面积达一千九百万亩，比去年扩大了一倍。
    这次生产高潮是在党中央提出的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下开展的。5月上旬，中共四川省委在小春丰收的情况下，根据党的总路线的精神，向全省人民发出跃进再跃进的号召后，全省农民立即掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产大检查运动。本着力争上游的精神，各地农业社都反复研究、寻找各种办法，千方百计地力争提高今年增产粮食的计划。许多县、乡和农业社豪迈地提出了今年实现“双千斤”（粮食亩产）、“双万斤”（红苕）的规划。各地边规划、边行动，不到半个月，生产就形成高潮。
    抓紧查苗、补苗、全苗的保苗斗争，加强秋收作物的田间管理是这个高潮的重要方面。各地的口号是“勤检查、勤管理，一定让秧苗长好，保证大春丰收”。泸州、南充等许多专区农业社都普遍制订了田间管理的计划，薅草、施肥的次数和施肥数量都比去年增加，积极准备消灭任何虫害。从5月中旬以来，由于气温变化和施肥不足等原因，各地都有部分早稻和玉米等苗稼生长较差，各地采取了薅除杂草、增施追肥、改善灌溉方法等措施，先后开展了消灭三类苗运动。泸州专区出动一百万人，日夜突击，不到十天就使全区几十万亩三类苗“升级”改观。
    为了保证足够的肥料供应大春作物追肥和为冬播做准备，各地相继开展了一个声势浩大的夏季积肥运动。
    抢时间抢栽红苕和扩大红苕栽种面积，是这次生产高潮的另一个内容。按照计划，今年全省要扩大五百万亩红苕，只这一项就可以增产粮食二、三十亿斤。各地利用一切空隙土地，创造出“堆堆苕”、
  “墩墩苕”等十几种扩大面积的办法，栽得又多、又快、又好。内江专区荣县创造的堆堆苕（用土堆在田边、空地甚至路边种红苕），几天内就在全区推广，只此一项就可以扩大三十五万亩面积，最少可增产一亿多斤粮食。（于竞祁）
    本报讯　山西省准备扩大夏季复种面积到九百万亩，争取一块土地夏、秋双丰收。这项变一年一作为一年两作或两年三作的改革，对完成今年粮食增产任务，对今后发挥耕地潜力、合理使用耕地也有着决定性的意义。
    目前，这项工作已随着小麦收打在各地紧张展开。绝大部分地区已制定出扩大复种计划和提早着手准备。洪赵、夏县和河津等县为复种地平均每亩准备了五、六千斤肥料，绝大部分已经送到地头。各地正在加紧筹备种籽、用具，开展技术训练传授。麦收较早的永济、芮城等县农业社统筹安排了夏季农忙用工，并固定了专业队伍，随收麦随展开复种。由于各地重视这项工作，今年的复种普遍是动手早、准备足、行动迅速，而且计划宏伟。晋城县四十一万亩麦田计划全部夏种；临汾县复种计划达到了麦田面积的70％。按照全省复种九百万亩的计划，今年复种面积占到了全省适宜复种面积的一半左右，超过了以往任何一年。全省复种地产量将达到全省总产量的十分之一。
    山西省适宜复种的耕地占全省耕地四分之一，过去复种面积很少。几年来各地的经验证明，进行复种好处很多：一、山西省大部分麦田一年一作，形成“半年闲”，利用休闲时间增种一季作物，当年就能增产大量粮食；二、可以缓和粮食作物与经济作物的矛盾。麦田实行复种给棉田轮作创造条件后，除能提高棉田产量，还可扩大棉田；三、目前主要产麦区由于种植作物单调，牲畜饲料、肥料得不到解决，农民吃食也很单调，扩大复种对解决饲料、肥料和改善农民生活都将起很大作用。
    1955年中共山西省委经过考察把复种作为经济作物区的增产关键，大力提倡推广，曾获得很大成效。但是在1956年反对所谓“冒进”中，不少地区有“两季不如一季收”的说法，使复种面积大大减缩。去冬以来各地在整风运动中通过大鸣大放大辩论，才为这项经验恢复名誉，并列为实现农业大跃进的主要措施。　（杨义）
