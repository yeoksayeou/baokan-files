　　The Funeral of a Turkish Judge
　　On May 2nd, a grand funeral was held in an Islamic temple in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. The deceased was Jinasuprulu, the chief judge of the Turkish Press Tribunal.
　　The funeral began with the usual rituals. Suddenly, a group of uninvited guests arrived. They were journalists from Ankara. The silent guests walked to the coffin and presented a wreath made of white flowers. In Turkey, white flowers are a symbol of celebration. This wreath represented not mourning but congratulation. The ribbon on the wreath read: "Farewell, we forgive you!" "Respectfully presented by journalists."
　　Among the protesters were five editors of Ankara newspapers and a columnist who had been sentenced to imprisonment or fines by the chief judge but had not yet served their sentences.
　　It turned out that this chief judge had spared no effort in enforcing Turkish laws that suppressed freedom of the press during his lifetime. The Turkish Press Act prohibits journalists from publishing reports on Turkey's economic situation, forbids the publication of articles excerpted from foreign newspapers and books, and prohibits criticism of members of the National Assembly. Those who violate the Act will be sentenced to one to five years in prison and fined one thousand to five thousand Turkish lira.
　　The Turkish Press Act also prohibits news vendors from shouting news in the streets to attract buyers. Violators are subject to one month's imprisonment. The Act also stipulates that journalists can be subjected to secret trials. The Turkish government also ordered that all advertisements must be reviewed by a government agency before they can be published in newspapers. The size and proportion of advertisements are also determined by this agency.
　　Under the leadership of Jinasuprulu, the Turkish Press Tribunal has vigorously suppressed freedom of the press and persecuted journalists. Even the Republican People's Party, which is basically in agreement with the ruling party (Democratic Party) in terms of political views, has been unable to maintain its organ, the "National Daily". The newspaper has been forced to cease publication for more than a month.
　　Among the reporters who presented white wreaths to Jinasuprulu was Burke, a columnist for the "National Daily". Burke said in his column not long ago that some hospitals in Turkey allow patients to weave baskets to relieve anxiety; Prime Minister Menderes should also adopt this method to relieve his anxiety about the opposition forces. For this, Burke was sentenced to eight months in prison and fined 2,600 lira by Jinasuprulu.
　　The death of Jinasuprulu has not eased the Turkish authorities' suppression of freedom of the press. After the funeral, one of the editors who had been sentenced was imprisoned. The rest will soon be imprisoned. (Le Shan) (Attached image)

### 土耳其法官的葬礼

　　土耳其法官的葬礼
    5月2日，土耳其首都安卡拉的一所伊斯兰教寺院里举行了一个盛大的葬礼。死者是土耳其新闻法庭的首席法官吉纳苏普鲁。
    葬礼开始，行礼如仪。突然来了一群不速之客。他们是安卡拉的新闻工作者。沉默的客人走到灵柩面前献上了白色鲜花扎成的花圈。在土耳其，白色鲜花是喜庆的标志。这个花圈所表示的不是哀悼而是庆贺。花圈的饰带上写着：“再会吧，我们饶恕你！”“新闻工作者谨献。”
    在这个抗议的行列里，有已被首席法官判处监禁或罚款而尚未执行的五名安卡拉报纸的编辑和一名专栏作家。
    原来，这位首席法官生前曾经不遗余力地执行土耳其摧残新闻自由的法律。土耳其的新闻法案禁止记者发表关于土耳其经济情况的报道，不准刊载摘自外国报刊书籍的文章和批评国民议会议员的文字。违反法案的人将被判处一年到五年的徒刑、罚金一千到五千土耳其里拉。
    土耳其的新闻法案还禁止报贩在街头叫喊新闻以吸引购买者。违者处以一个月的徒刑。法案还规定可以对新闻记者进行秘密审讯。土耳其政府并下令规定一切广告必须经过一个政府机构审查后才能在报纸上刊登。广告的大小和比例也由该机构决定。
    在吉纳苏普鲁领导下的土耳其新闻法庭，极力摧残新闻自由，迫害新闻工作者。连在政治主张方面基本上与执政党（民主党）一致的共和人民党也无法维持它的机关报——“民族报”。该报被迫停刊已有一个多月了。
    向吉纳苏普鲁献白色花圈的记者中，有“民族报”的专栏作家贝尔克。贝尔克不久以前在他的专栏里说：土耳其的一些医院都允许病人织篮，以消除焦虑；曼德列斯总理也应该采用这个办法，来消除他对反对派力量的焦虑。为此，贝尔克竟被吉纳苏普鲁判处徒刑八个月，罚款二千六百里拉。
    吉纳苏普鲁的死，并没有缓和土耳其当局对新闻自由的摧残。葬礼完毕以后，已被判刑的一名编辑被关进了监狱。其余的几名不久也将入狱服刑。  （乐山）（附图片）
