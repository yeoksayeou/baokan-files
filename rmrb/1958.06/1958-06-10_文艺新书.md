New Literary Works

　　"Great Changes in a Mountain Village"

　　This is a new full-length novel by Zhou Libo. Judging from the historical circumstances and typical significance it reflects, it can be said to be a sequel to "The Hurricane"; although one writes about the land reform in the Northeast region, and the other writes about the agricultural cooperation movement in the mountain villages of Hunan. They are two storms and stresses in the Chinese countryside.

　　The novel describes the unusually profound and extensive changes caused by the agricultural cooperation movement in a remote mountain village. The economic foundation of private ownership, which has been followed for thousands of years, old social customs, family life, and relationships between people have all been overturned in a short period of time.

　　The author portrays several revolutionary cadres and farmers with simple strokes. Deng Xiumei, Li Yuehui, Chen Dachun, and others all have their own character traits.

　　This book was serialized in People's Literature and will soon be published by Writers Publishing House. (Jing)

　　"Youth"

　　The Soviet writer Alexander Boichenko's novel "Youth" describes the Ukrainian people's struggle under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party from 1921 to 1930 to restore the national economy and realize socialist industrialization, with emphasis on the life of the Soviet Komsomol.

　　In this work, the author portrays the image of the old Bolshevik Iskrov, who devoted all his energy to the people and enthusiastically cultivated the younger generation; and depicts the brilliant deeds of the young people Vasili, Vadim, Grisha, and others. Through their work, study, life, and love, their noble qualities and heroic spirit are reflected.

　　This book is published by China Youth Publishing House. (Jiang)

　　"Lark Girl"

　　"Lark Girl" (published by Yangtze River Literature and Art Publishing House) is about Liu Ying, a fourteen-year-old girl who is a first-year junior high school student in a school in Beijing. In order to realize her ideal of becoming a female combine harvester operator, she left her warm family and lovely school and ran from Beijing to "Beidahuang" to participate in land reclamation work and learn to drive a tractor.

　　The work uses popular words and simple brushstrokes to describe Liu Ying's growth process, shaping a vivid image that shines with the brilliance of socialist thought and is worthy of being a role model for the vast number of young people. (Hongliang)

    “山乡巨变”
    这是周立波的一部长篇新著。从它反映的历史情况和典型意义看，可以说是“暴风骤雨”的续篇；虽然一个写的是东北地区的土改，一个写的却是湖南山乡的农业合作化运动。它们是中国农村的两次暴风骤雨。
    小说描写了一个僻静的山乡在农业合作化运动中所引起的异常深广的变化，相沿几千年的私有制的经济基础，古旧的社会习俗，家庭生活面貌，以及人和人的关系等，在一个短时间中，都连根被掀翻了。
    作者以朴素的笔触，刻划了几个革命干部和农民的形象，其中邓秀梅、李月辉、陈大春等都各有自己的性格特征。
    本书曾在人民文学连载，即将由作家出版社出版　　（靖）
    “青春”
    苏联作家亚历山大·鲍依琴柯的小说“青春”，描写了1921到1930年间乌克兰人民在苏联共产党的领导下为恢复国民经济、为实现社会主义工业化而进行的斗争，其中着重描述了苏联共青团的生活。
    作者在这部作品里，刻划了把全部精力献给人民、热心培养青年一代的老布尔什维克依斯克洛夫的形象；描绘了青年华西里、瓦吉姆、格里莎等人的光辉事迹。通过这些人的工作、学习、生活和爱情，反映出了他们的崇高品质和英勇气概。
