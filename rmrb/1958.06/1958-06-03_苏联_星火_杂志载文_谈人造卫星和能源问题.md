Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd dispatch: The latest issue of "Spark" magazine published an article stating that one day, a giant artificial satellite one hundred times the size of the artificial third satellite will appear in the sky.

The magazine explored the issue of utilizing solar cells in space flight. It pointed out that an important problem in space flight is ensuring the energy required by space travelers during the existence of giant satellites. This problem will be solved by silicon cells, which have already been used on the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite.

During space flight, silicon cells can obtain energy equivalent to burning one ton of fuel per month from fifteen square meters of metal sheets constantly illuminated by the sun. If the satellite were to carry one ton of fuel from the ground, it would have to consume dozens of tons of fuel more at takeoff. Otherwise, the required takeoff speed could not be achieved.

    苏联“星火”杂志载文
    谈人造卫星和能源问题
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期“星火”杂志发表文章说，会有那么一天，天空中将出现相当于人造第三个卫星一百倍的巨型人造地球卫星。
    这家杂志探讨了在宇宙飞行中利用太阳能电池的问题。它指出，宇宙飞行的一个重要问题，是保证在巨型卫星存在期间宇宙飞行者所需要的能量的问题。这个问题将由矽电池来解决，苏联第三个人造卫星上已经采用了这种电池。
    在宇宙飞行时期内，矽电池每月可以从十五平方公尺被太阳不断照射的金属薄片上得到等于燃烧一吨燃料所得的能量。而如果让卫星从地面上携带一吨燃料，那就得在起飞时多消耗数十吨燃料。否则就不能达到所需要的起飞速度。
