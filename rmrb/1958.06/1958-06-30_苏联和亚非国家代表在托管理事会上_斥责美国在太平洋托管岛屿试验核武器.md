Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 28th: According to TASS, the United Nations Trusteeship Council concluded its discussion on the situation of the Pacific Islands under US trusteeship on the 26th.

    Representatives of Asian and African countries condemned the United States for continuing nuclear weapons tests in these trust territories in their speeches. Indian representative Mr. Lall emphasized that the United Nations documents recognize the strategic importance of the Pacific Islands, but this does not mean that the trustee authority can do whatever it wants in these places. The United States' use of trust territories for nuclear weapons testing violates the United Nations Charter and is an intolerable injustice towards the people of Asia.

    Mr. Lall proposed a motion demanding that the United States stop nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Trust Territories.

    Ahmed Osman, representative of the United Arab Republic, also emphasized that neither the United Nations Charter nor the trusteeship agreement gives the trustee authority the right to conduct nuclear tests in the trust territory.

    U Thant, the representative of Burma, warmly supported a complete cessation of nuclear testing and the cessation of the use of trust territories for testing. He said, we cannot but express our gratitude for the bold and wise decision of the Soviet government to unilaterally cease testing atomic and hydrogen bombs. U Thant expressed his support for the Indian proposal.

    Representatives of the United States, Britain, and other colonialist countries tried their best to end the discussion on the issue of the United States using trust territories for nuclear testing. Their excuse was that this issue does not seem to fall under the jurisdiction of the Trusteeship Council and can only be discussed in the Security Council. They also used the expert meeting scheduled to be held in Geneva as an excuse, insisting that the solution to the issue of using trust territories for nuclear testing depended on the outcome of this meeting.

    Soviet representative Mr. Lobanov pointed out that the US representative's excuse of the Geneva expert meeting was untenable, and the United States has not even now put the task of resolving the cessation of nuclear testing to this meeting. The Soviet representative said that the United States had no right to use the trust territories for nuclear testing, either in the past or now.

    The Soviet representative finally expressed support for the Indian proposal and withdrew the similar proposal previously put forward by the Soviet Union.

    After this, the US representative actually wanted to put the Soviet proposal to a vote, so that he could enjoy the pleasure of voting against the Soviet proposal. Other representatives said that wouldn't the Soviet proposal become the US proposal, then the US representative would have to vote against his own proposal. The US representative's behavior caused confusion, forcing the chairman to interrupt the meeting. After the break, the US representative said that "at the request of friends" he did not insist on his suggestion.

    The Indian proposal was finally submitted to a vote, and the representatives of India, the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, and Burma voted in favor. The representatives of Haiti and Guatemala abstained. However, because the seven delegations that supported the United States voted against it, the Indian proposal was rejected.

    苏联和亚非国家代表在托管理事会上
    斥责美国在太平洋托管岛屿试验核武器
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社纽约27日讯：联合国托管理事会26日结束了关于美国托管的太平洋岛屿的状况问题的讨论。
    亚非国家的代表们在发言中谴责美国在这些托管岛屿继续试验核武器。印度代表拉尔强调指出，联合国的文件中承认太平洋岛屿的战略意义，但是，这丝毫不意味着托管当局可以在这些地方为所欲为。美国利用托管岛屿进行核武器试验违反联合国宪章，并且是对亚洲人民采取难以容忍的不公平态度的表现。
    拉尔提出一个提案，要求美国停止在太平洋托管地试验核武器。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表艾哈迈德·欧斯曼也着重指出，无论是联合国宪章还是托管协定都没有给予托管当局利用托管地进行核试验的权利。
    缅甸代表吴丹热烈赞成完全停止核试验和停止使用托管地进行试验。他说，我们不能不感谢苏联政府单方面停止试验原子弹和氢弹的大胆和英明的决定。吴丹表示支持印度的提案。
    美国、英国和其他殖民主义国家的代表们竭力企图结束关于美国利用托管地进行核试验问题的讨论。他们的借口是：这个问题似乎不属于托管理事会的权限，只能在安全理事会讨论。他们还利用预定在日内瓦召开的专家会议作为借口，硬说解决关于利用托管地进行核试验的问题有待这个会议的结果。
    苏联代表洛巴诺夫指出，美国代表以日内瓦专家会议为借口是站不住脚的，美国甚至到现在还没有把解决停止核试验问题的任务向这个会议提出。苏联代表说，美国不论在以前或现在都没有权利利用托管地来进行核试验。
    苏联代表最后表示支持印度的提案，而撤回苏联以前提出的类似的提案。
    在这以后，美国代表竟要把苏联的提案提出表决，以便自己能过一过投票反对苏联提案的瘾。其他代表说，这一来苏联的提案岂不成了美国的提案，那末美国代表就得投票反对自己的提案了。美国代表的行为引起了混乱，迫使主席中断了会议。在休息以后美国代表才说，“根据朋友们的请求”，他不坚持自己的建议。
    印度提案最后提交表决，投票赞成的有印度、苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国和缅甸的代表。海地和危地马拉的代表弃权。但是由于支持美国的七个代表团投票反对，印度提案被否决。
