    Sweep Away the Gray Worldview
    Shí Gē
    The deepening of ideological remolding has touched upon a most fundamental question in the worldview: What do we live for?

    People can have various understandings of life; but as long as you are alive, you have your attitude towards life—this attitude comes precisely from your purpose in life. However, strangely enough, the advocates of various gray worldviews say in unison that they "just live to live!" It seems they have lost the power of will, living like a mere organism. And some claim that they have completely abandoned the idea of fame and fortune, reaching the enlightened state of "all is vanity," neither coveting life nor fearing death. They have an air of "seeing through the world" and "laughing alone at the foolishness of the world."

    But, after all, man is human! They think and act incessantly, influencing the world around them. Whether consciously or unconsciously, they do have their own purpose, but some people deceitfully hide it.

    The opposition between the gray worldview and the revolutionary worldview is precisely the opposition between pessimism and revolutionary optimism in life. And revolutionary optimism always belongs to the advanced class of the revolution, while pessimism has become the eternal companion of the declining reactionary classes for generations. This opposing attitude of people in life reflects precisely the struggle of two social forces: one will lose the world, and the other will win the world; one fears the future, and the other cheers the future; one sings of victory, and the other laments failure....

    This is because, for the advanced class of the revolution, life is a continuous battle, a continuous victory, and a continuous joyful advance. At present, the Chinese people, after getting rid of the shackles of slavery in the economic, political, and ideological spheres, have become the masters of the country. They are striding forward, singing loudly, with boundless vigor, joy, and heroic spirit. A scene of joy has emerged on every construction front. Life is leaping, the world is rushing forward. The people of the whole country are reshaping life and the world according to their own intentions with inexhaustible energy. We live in a red era. There is no gray here, let alone white or black. Therefore, everyone should be red, can be red; everyone should be happy, can be happy. Intellectuals are not inherently the social force that is about to perish. However, as the exponents of the ideology of the class being eliminated, or as the sons and daughters of this class, and even those intellectuals who are close to the petty owners of this class, they will still be stubbornly clung to by the social forces that are about to perish until they have completely transformed their stand.

    "Man dies for wealth, the bird for food," is the creed of the bourgeoisie, and it is also the consistent life purpose of bourgeois intellectuals. Bourgeois intellectuals firmly believe that people should live for themselves, and they live wholeheartedly to strive for their own position, honor, and enjoyment. They have also worked hard in this world, studying and working, with self as the center and individual struggle as the criterion. Once the entire society undergoes earth-shaking changes, the cornerstone on which they stand is overthrown, the purpose of life they rely on is destroyed, and the "ambition" of individualism is nipped in the bud. All this is enough to crush their ideals and beliefs. They are dissatisfied, they are angry, they want to destroy themselves, and at the same time destroy the world that "hinders" their development, but they are once again defeated by life. They hate "unfulfilled ambitions," they hate "untimely death," and feel that "the world is fickle" and "human relationships are cold." They know that they cannot resist the new trend, but they are unwilling to abandon the "burden" and truly devote themselves to the new trend. They stand in the trend on the one hand, and want to escape on the other—to escape from this revolutionary reality that they do not like. However, they cannot but live in this reality. Thus, some burrow into piles of ancient books to "take shelter from the wind," wanting to avoid sharp political struggles, and seek sympathy and comfort from the ancients with the depression of twentieth-century misanthropes, but they cannot remain completely silent and issue some "cynical" words from the air-raid shelter from time to time; some adopt a theatrical attitude to life, deliberately paralyzing themselves, turning a deaf ear to the voice of the times, learning the "bravery" of Don Quixote, unrestrained and unconventional, cynical; and some further develop decadent hedonism, with increasingly short-sighted eyes, "thinking only of today's lunch—and only today's lunch," the greatest pleasure is to build an "easy life" for themselves.

    Is all this just "living to live"? No, their purpose in life is just to be able to do as much for themselves as possible; whether it is crouching in the hard shell of individualism like a snail, or hiding in the cracks of collectivism like a moth. Moreover, in order to win moral "legitimacy" for this shameful little personalistic living space, they secretly embolden themselves by saying: "Everyone else is like this, there is no such thing as true selflessness!"

    Alas! Facts always contradict them, and history always plays jokes on them. The more they hope that others can stick to the crumbling fortresses of the nineteenth century like them, the more batches of old friends leave them and run to the front. The more they want to use the shield of individualism to block the flood of collectivism, the more fiercely the flood of collectivism comes wave after wave. Their small "comfort zone" is impacted again and again, and the impact is more and more fierce each time. Finally, the dike of individualism is breached, and all the "family assets" of individualism are thrown out. However, some family masters "still hold the pipa half-covered," unwilling to come out for a long time, and insist on hanging a "fig leaf" with the words: "Gray worldview—just to live to live." It is said that some people even added a note: "This is not individualism!"

    However, what exactly are the colors of the gray worldview? Hasn't it already been well explained by the "family assets" they overturned, no matter how diverse their brands are, they are all of one quality: egoism centered on the individual! Here, we have not found even a small piece of "altruistic" material!

    The reason why those with a gray worldview are "gray" is rooted here! If life is not to be gray, it must first start from abandoning this!

    扫除灰色人生观
    石戈
    思想改造的深化，接触到了人生观中的一个最根本的问题：为了什么而活着？
    对生活的理解，人们可以有各种各样；但是只要你还活着，就有着你对生活的态度——这态度，正是由你生活目的中来的。然而，奇怪的是，各种灰色人生观的论者，却异口同声地说，他们“只是为活着而活着”！好像已经失去了意志的力量，如同一个生物样地活着。并且有人声称，他们已完全抛弃了名利思想，达到了“四大皆空”的化境，既不贪图活着，对死亦无所惧。大有“看破红尘”、“独笑世人痴”之概。
    可是，人究竟是人！他们一日也不能停息地思想着、行动着，影响自己周围的世界。不论是自觉地还是不自觉地，他们确是有着自己的目的，只不过有些人自欺欺人地隐藏它罢了。
    灰色人生观和革命人生观的对立，这正是生活中的悲观主义和革命乐观主义的对立。而革命乐观主义则总是属于革命的先进阶级的，悲观主义恰成了世世代代没落的反动阶级的永远的侣伴。人们在生活中的这种对立的态度，正是反映了两种社会力量的斗争：一个将失去世界，一个将赢得世界；一个恐惧未来，一个欢呼未来；一个歌唱胜利，一个哀怨失败……。
    这是因为，对于革命的先进阶级来说，生活就是不断地战斗、不断地胜利、不断地欢乐的前进。目前，中国人民在经济、政治和思想上摆脱了奴隶的枷锁后，已经成为国家的主人。他们正以无限的朝气、喜气和豪气，迈着脚步，高歌前进。无论是在哪个建设战线上，都出现了一片欢乐的气象。生活在飞跃，世界在奔腾。全国人民正以无穷的精力，按照自己的意图，重新塑造生活，塑造世界。我们生活在一个红色的时代。这里，没有灰色，更没有白色或黑色。因此，人人应该红，可以红；人人应该欢乐，可以欢乐。知识分子，本来不是行将灭亡的社会力量的本身。但是，作为被消灭阶级意识形态的表现者，或者是这个阶级出身的子弟，以至那些和这个阶级接近的小私有者的知识分子，在他们还没有彻底改造自己的立场以前，他们仍然会被行将灭亡的社会力量死缠着不放。
    “人不为己，天诛地灭”，这是资产阶级的信条，也是资产阶级知识分子一贯的生活目的。资产阶级知识分子坚信人是应该为自己的，他们一心一意地为争取自己的地位、荣誉、享受而活着。他们也曾在这世界上辛勤地学习着、劳动着，以自我为中心，以个人奋斗为准则。一旦整个社会来了个天翻地覆，他们站脚的基石被推翻了，他们所依仗的生活目的被摧毁了，个人主义的“雄心”被夭折了。这一切就足够把他们的理想、信念全都挤得粉碎。他们不满，他们愤怒，他们想要毁掉自己，同时毁掉这“障碍”他们发展的世界，但是他们再一次地被生活打败了。他们恨
  “壮志未酬”，他们恨“怀才不遇”，觉得“世态炎凉”，“人情冷漠”。他们既自知不能抗拒新的潮流，却又不愿抛弃“包袱”，真正投入新的潮流。一边站在潮流之中，一边又想逃逸——逃出这个他们所不喜欢的革命的现实。然而，他们又不能不居于这现实中生活。于是，有的钻进了古书堆里去“躲风”，想避免尖锐的政治斗争，带着二十世纪的厌世主义者的抑郁去向古人寻找同情和慰借，却又不能完全沉默无闻，不时从防空洞里发出一些“愤世嫉俗”之词；有的则采取了作戏的态度来对待人生，有意麻痹自己，对时代的声音充耳不闻，学着唐·吉呵德式的“勇敢”，疏放不拘，玩世不恭；有的则进一步发展了腐朽的享乐主义，眼光日益浅短，“想到的只是今天的午饭——也仅仅是今天的午饭”，最大的乐趣就是给自己建立一个“安乐窝”。
    难道这一切，就仅仅“只是为着活着而活着”？不，他们的生活目的，只是要能够多为自己就多为自己；不管是像蜗牛式地伏在个人主义的硬壳里，还是像蛀虫式地藏在集体主义的隙缝里。而且，为了替这可耻的一点个人主义的生活空间争取道义上的“合法”，他们还偷偷地给自己壮胆说：“别人都是这样的，真正大公无私的人是没有的！”
    可惜啊！事实总是和他们作对，历史老是和他们开玩笑。他们越希望别人都能像他们那样固守在十九世纪的残堡里，而一批一批的故友却离开他们跑到前面去了。他们越想用个人主义的盾牌来挡住集体主义的洪潮，而集体主义的洪潮却一浪一浪地来得更紧。他们那小小的“安乐窝”一次又一次被冲击着，而一次比一次冲击得猛，终于个人主义的堤防被冲破了，个人主义的“家底”全都被抛了出来。但是，有的家主人“犹抱琵琶半遮面”，迟迟地不愿走出来，并且偏要挂出一块“遮羞布”，上面写着：“灰色人生观——只是为活着而活着”。据说，有的人竟还加上注解：“这并不是个人主义”！
    然而，灰色人生观究竟是些什么货色呢？难道从他们翻的“家底”里不已经很好的说明，不论它们的牌号有多种多样，却都是一个质地：以个人为中心的利己主义！在这里，我们还没有发现有一小片“利他主义”的料子！
    灰色人生观者之所以“灰”，根源正在这里！生活如要不灰，那就必须先从抛弃这个开始！
