Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 13th: According to Damascus Radio, a group of five UN observers led by New Zealand Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Brown arrived in Beirut from Israel on the 12th. They are in Lebanon pursuant to the resolution passed by the UN Security Council on the 11th to investigate the Lebanese government's accusation of the Arab United Republic’s “interference in Lebanese internal affairs.”

On the same day, the Lebanese National United Front issued a statement in Beirut saying that the UN Security Council's decision would not affect the struggle of the Lebanese people. The statement said that if the UN truly wants to calm the situation there, UN observers should investigate the entry of American, British, and French weapons into Lebanon, as well as the entry of weapons and personnel from Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq into Lebanon.

Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam also issued a statement to the press in Beirut on the 12th, stating that he would not cooperate with the UN observers. He pointed out that the Security Council's resolution was completely irrelevant to the current struggle of the Lebanese people. Salam said that the committee should investigate the shipping of weapons from the United States, Britain, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq into Lebanese ports and airports. He said that these weapons were being given to convicted criminals released from prison and disbanded paramilitary fascist organizations during this particular period, with the aim of creating tribal discord and suppressing the people's movement.

He pointed out that the most harmful interference in Lebanon's internal affairs is "the political interference practiced by Western countries and their vassal states, and as clearly demonstrated by the actions of their embassies in Lebanon."

Shafik Mutada, an opposition parliamentarian from Baalbek, Lebanon, also said on the same day that the arrival of UN observers will not change the current situation. The people will continue to fight until victory and the defeat of the imperialists and their agents.

According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock had already discussed the establishment of a large "observation" organization in Lebanon with UN Emergency Force Commander Burns on the 11th. It is believed that the United States is attempting to expand its interference in Lebanon's internal affairs and suppress the uprising of the Lebanese people through this old trick of borrowing the name of the United Nations.

    黎巴嫩反对派严正表示
    不同联合国观察员合作
    应调查的是美英等国供应武器情况
    新华社大马士革13日电  据大马士革电台广播，由新西兰军官莫里斯·布朗中校率领的联合国观察员五人，12日从以色列到达贝鲁特。他们是根据联合国安全理事会11日通过的决议到黎巴嫩去调查黎巴嫩政府提出的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政”的控诉的。
    同一天，黎巴嫩民族统一阵线在贝鲁特发表声明说，联合国安全理事会的决定，影响不了黎巴嫩人民的斗争。声明说，如果联合国真想平息那里的局势，联合国观察员就应当去调查美国、英国、法国武器运入黎巴嫩的情况和土耳其、约旦、伊拉克的武器、人员进入黎巴嫩的情况。
    黎巴嫩反对派领袖、前总理萨拉姆也在12日在贝鲁特向报界发表声明，表示他将不同联合国的观察员合作。他指出，安理会的决议是同目前黎巴嫩人民的斗争毫不相干。萨拉姆说，这个委员会应当调查从美国、英国、土耳其、约旦和伊拉克把武器运进黎巴嫩的港口和机场的事情。他说，这些武器是运给在目前这一特别时期从狱中释放出来的已判刑的罪犯和已被解散的半军事性法西斯组织，其目的是造成部落的不和和扑灭人民运动。
    他指出，对黎巴嫩内政最有害的干涉就是“西方各国和它们的仆从国家所实行的以及它们驻黎巴嫩大使馆的行动所恶迹昭彰地表明的政治干涉”。
    黎巴嫩巴尔贝克的反对党议员沙菲克·穆塔达也在当天说，联合国观察员的到来将不会改变目前的局势。人民将继续斗争，直到胜利和击败帝国主义者及其代理人时为止。
    据报道，美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克已经在11日同联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯讨论了在黎巴嫩设立一个庞大的“观察”机构的问题。人们认为，美国企图通过这种假借联合国名义的老手法来扩大它对黎巴嫩内政的干涉，镇压黎巴嫩人民的起义。
