Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 25th: Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) has recently started construction on another large blast furnace, one of the largest blast furnaces under construction in China.

At the blast furnace construction Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally held yesterday, builders from design, construction and installation, and equipment manufacturing units proposed to guarantee the faster and better completion of the blast furnace construction task with the heroic spirit of "riding satellites, driving rockets, chasing electric current, and catching up with light."

The newly started blast furnace, from construction to the manufacturing of giant equipment, will be undertaken by Ansteel employees themselves. It will adopt new technologies such as high-pressure furnace top, steam blowing, skip car loading device, and using belt conveyors instead of ore trucks. Its major construction workload is almost twice as large as the renovated No. 3 blast furnace, but the construction investment is less than three-quarters of that of the No. 3 blast furnace.

The construction of this blast furnace is an important measure for Ansteel to actively promote the overall Great Leap Forward in production. During the Double-Anti Movement, Ansteel employees took various measures to exploit the production potential of existing factories and mines, resulting in a situation where the rolling capacity was greater than the steelmaking capacity, and the steelmaking capacity was limited by the iron smelting capacity and could not be fully utilized. After the new blast furnace is put into production, this production imbalance can be changed.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 25th: Ansteel No. 1 Steelmaking Plant's No. 9 open hearth furnace has recently started renovation; after the renovation, it will become China's largest tilting open hearth furnace.

The original plan for No. 9 open hearth furnace was to carry out a major overhaul for twenty days this year, and it was later decided to take advantage of the major overhaul to carry out the renovation. The renovation takes only twenty days more than the major overhaul, but the output of steel per heat from this open hearth furnace will increase by 30% compared with the past, and the smelting time will also be shortened by more than one hour, which can increase the country's steel production by more than 80,000 tons per year.

The renovation of No. 9 open hearth furnace is a major measure for the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant to realize this year's Great Leap Forward plan, and it will provide a reliable guarantee for the latest Great Leap Forward plan to increase production by 100,000 tons of steel in the second half of the year.

### 让炼铁能力适应炼钢轧钢能力  鞍钢又建一座大高炉  我国最大的倾动式平炉即将改建

    让炼铁能力适应炼钢轧钢能力
    鞍钢又建一座大高炉
    我国最大的倾动式平炉即将改建
    新华社鞍山25日电　鞍钢又有一座大型高炉最近开工兴建，这是我国已开始建设的最大的高炉之一。
    在昨天举行的高炉施工大跃进誓师大会上，设计、建筑安装、设备制造等单位的建设者提出，要以“乘卫星、驾火箭、追电流、赶光线”的英雄气概，保证更快、更好地完成这座高炉的建设任务。
    新开工的这座高炉，从建设到制造巨型设备，都将由鞍钢职工自己担任。它将采用高压炉顶、蒸汽鼓风、料车式装料装置和用皮带机代替矿石车等新技术。它的几项主要的建设工程量，几乎比改建的三号高炉大一倍左右，但是建设投资却不到三号高炉的四分之三。
    兴建这座高炉，是鞍钢积极促进生产全面大跃进的一项重要措施。在双反运动中，鞍钢职工采取各种措施发挥原有厂矿的生产潜力，出现了轧钢能力大于炼钢、炼钢能力又受炼铁能力的限制不能充分发挥的情况。新建的高炉投入生产以后，就可以改变这种生产不平衡的状况。
    据新华社鞍山25日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂九号平炉最近动工改建；改建后它将成为我国最大的倾动式平炉。
    九号平炉原计划今年用二十天时间进行大修，以后决定趁大修机会进行改建。改建比大修的时间，仅仅多二十天，但是这座平炉每炉钢的产量却比过去增加30％，熔炼时间也将缩短一个多小时，每年能为国家增产八万多吨钢。
    九号平炉的改建，是第一炼钢厂实现今年跃进规划的一项重大措施，它将为下半年增产十万吨钢的最新跃进规划提供可靠的保证。
