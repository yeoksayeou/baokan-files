Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 12th—According to TASS, Paris, June 11th: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez delivered a speech at the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session, which closed on the 10th, pointing out the characteristics of the current situation in France. This speech was published in the "l'Humanité" on the 11th.

	Thorez said that the "legal facade" that De Gaulle used to conceal himself "cannot hide the basic fact that De Gaulle came to power not by the free will of the National Assembly, but by coups in Algiers and Ajaccio (capital of Corsica)."

	Thorez emphasized that although De Gaulle deliberately made his program vague in an attempt to confuse the people, it is becoming increasingly clear that the De Gaulle government and its policies are a serious threat to the working class, to democracy, and to France. This threat is even greater after De Gaulle obtained extremely broad powers "equal to a true dictatorship."

	Thorez continued, "De Gaulle supports the most extreme colonialist, extreme chauvinist, and extreme reactionary strata of the bourgeoisie. Like all reactionary governments, the De Gaulle government defends the interests of the big bourgeoisie."

	The fact that De Gaulle uses the army as a tool for his rule once again demonstrates the connection between war policies and reactionary and fascist policies; they are complementary.

	Thorez emphasized in his speech, "De Gaulle's conspiracy does not show the strength of the bourgeoisie, but only the weakness of the bourgeoisie." He said that the bourgeoisie's adoption of dictatorship and autocracy is precisely an admission that it can no longer maintain its rule by traditional means.

	Thorez also pointed out: "On the other hand, this conspiracy would not have succeeded without the relative weakness of the workers' and democratic forces, without the division of these forces, and without the division caused by anti-communism. The Socialist Party and its leaders, such as Guy Mollet and Lacoste, bear a serious responsibility for De Gaulle's rise to power." He said that he was referring not only to the events of recent weeks, but to the entire policy of the Socialist Party since 1947. "This policy now reveals its true colors: a path to bankruptcy, betraying the interests of the working class and democracy."

	Thorez pointed out that there is an urgent need to unite all republican forces, regardless of their views, to resist fascism, defend democratic freedoms, and oppose tearing up the French constitution. He said: "In particular, it is necessary to unite the forces of the left through anti-fascist committees and through committees for the defense of the Republic. These committees should be established at mass meetings, in factories, in cities, and in every village. Thousands upon thousands of such committees in various places can produce their leading bodies through democratically convened congresses. Only such committees can take deep root among the people. It is precisely in this way that it can be guaranteed to mobilize the masses to repel any attack of a fascist nature without delay, to repel attacks on workers, republican activists, and the sites of people's organizations, and to repel any persecution of the democratic press."

	Finally, Thorez talked about the activities of the French Communist Party in recent times. He said: "At the moment of trial, the Socialist Party and all other parties were torn apart, while our party showed itself to be as united and strong as a rock. In the face of the entire people, it showed itself to be the main force of democracy and freedom."

	Finally, Thorez called on all Communist Party members to organize the masses and fight for the elimination of personal dictatorship, for the rejection of the constitutional amendment draft in a nationwide vote, for peace in Algeria, for the restoration of republican freedoms, and for a free, strong, and happy France!

    多列士分析当前法国局势特点
    戴高乐政权表明法国资产阶级的软弱
    广泛动员群众就能击败法西斯的进攻
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社巴黎11日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士在10日闭幕的法共中央全会上发表了讲话，指出当前法国局势的特点。这篇讲话刊登在11日的“人道报”上。
    多列士说，戴高乐用来掩饰自己的“法律幌子”“并不能掩盖这样一个基本事实：戴高乐取得政权不是依靠国民议会的自由意志，而是依靠阿尔及利亚和阿耶佐（科西嘉首府）的政变”。
    多列士强调指出，虽然戴高乐故意把他的施政纲领弄得含糊其辞，企图以此来迷惑人民，但是越来越明显，戴高乐政府和他的政策是对工人阶级、对民主和对法国的严重威胁。当戴高乐取得了“等于真正独裁”的极其广泛的权力之后，这种威胁就更大了。
    多列士继续说，“戴高乐支持资产阶级中极端殖民主义、极端沙文主义和极端反动的阶层。戴高乐政府同一切反动政府一样，是保卫大资产阶级的利益的。”
    戴高乐利用军队作为他执政的工具这个事实，再一次表明了战争政策同反动政策和法西斯政策之间的联系；它们是相辅相成的。
    多列士在讲话中强调说，“戴高乐的阴谋不是表明资产阶级的力量，而只是表明了资产阶级的软弱。”他说，资产阶级采用独裁政权和专制，正是承认它已经不能用传统的手段来维持它的统治。
    多列士同时也指出：“另方面，如果没有工人力量和民主力量的相对软弱，没有这些力量的分裂，没有由于反共所造成的分裂，这个阴谋是不可能成功的。社会党及其领导人，像居伊·摩勒和拉戈斯特之流对戴高乐的上台是负有严重的责任的。”他说，他所指的不仅是最近几周以来的事件，而是指的从1947年以来社会党的全部政策。“这个政策现在暴露了它的真面貌：走向破产的道路、出卖工人阶级和民主的利益。”
    多列士指出，目前迫切需要联合一切共和力量，不管这些力量的观点如何，来反抗法西斯、保卫民主自由和反对撕毁法国的宪法。他说：“特别是要通过反法西斯委员会，通过保卫共和委员会来联合左翼的力量。这些委员会应当在群众大会上、在工厂里、在城市里、在每个村庄里建立起来。各地成千上万的这种委员会将可以通过民主召开的代表大会来产生它们的领导机构。只有这样的委员会才能在人民群众中扎下很深的根。正是这种方式才能保证动员群众来毫不拖延地回击法西斯性质的任何进攻，回击对于工人、共和积极分子和人民团体所在地的进攻，回击对于民主报刊的任何迫害”。
    最后多列士谈到最近时期法国共产党的活动。他说：“在考验的关头，社会党和所有其他的党都四分五裂，而我们的党表现出像磐石一样团结和坚强。在全体人民的面前表现出它是民主和自由的主要力量。”
    多列士最后号召全体共产党员把群众组织起来，为消灭个人独裁、争取全民投票时否决宪法修正草案、争取阿尔及利亚和平、争取恢复共和自由以及争取自由强大和幸福的法国而斗争！
