    The Bearing of Ordinary Laborers
    —Excerpts of Leading Cadres Participating in Voluntary Labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site
    By Our Correspondent Wang Boqing
    Just as Chairman Mao taught, in the past few months, more than 630 cadres at the level of minister, vice-minister, director, and bureau chief from various ministries of the central government have appeared as ordinary laborers, rushing to the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, known as the “communist furnace,” to eat, live, and labor with the thousands of reservoir builders, demonstrating a noble communist spirit.

    Be Sure to Keep the Red Flag
    On the evening of May 31, Li Zheren, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, and other responsible cadres, who had rushed to the construction site, were assigned to the Seventh Squad, which had consistently maintained the winning red flag, to participate in labor. As soon as Li Zheren arrived, he expressed his determination. He said to Squad Leader Liu Junpei, the secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, "Comrade Squad Leader, I will obey your orders, resolutely complete the task, and be sure to keep the red flag!" When labor began, Li Zheren rushed to do the heavy work. Some of the young men were carrying a basket of stones together, while he carried a load on a shoulder pole. When the people loading the baskets gave him less, he always asked, "Add a few more, add a few more!" When others said it was enough, he argued reasonably, "One side is heavy and the other is light, how can I carry it properly!" If you didn't add more for him, he simply put down the pole and added a few more stones himself, and then quickly ran off with the load. He still felt that he was not doing enough, and kept asking people, "Is this the right way to do it? We must keep the red flag!" Although the sweat on his back soaked through his undershirt, shirt, and outer clothing, he didn't care at all. As soon as the break whistle blew, Li Zheren called out, "In order to keep our red flag, those comrades who have been laboring for a long time should rest, and those who came tonight should continue working!" Everyone forgot their fatigue and responded "Work!" in unison, and work efficiency was repeatedly improved. After the hard work of all the comrades, the amount of earth moved by the eight squads of the Ministry of Foreign Trade that night created a new record since participating in voluntary labor, and the red flag showing victory was still flying high on the construction site of the Seventh Squad.

    Everyone is the Same
    June 8 was a Sunday. Although Wang Dacheng, Vice Minister of Textile Industry, had to attend a meeting that afternoon, he still took the time in the morning to participate in labor at the reservoir construction site. Originally, the comrades in the ministry, considering that he was nearly sixty years old and had work to do that afternoon, advised him to go to the construction site to do some comforting work and not to labor. But he didn't agree. He said, "How can that be? Going there is for labor, and talking to everyone can be done during the break." When he arrived at the construction site, Wang Dacheng put his coat under a stone and quickly joined the ranks of intense labor, sometimes swinging a pickaxe to dig sand and gravel, and sometimes carrying stones on a shoulder pole. When carrying stones, several comrades wanted to put their shoulder pads on Wang Dacheng, but he patted his shoulder and said, "It's okay, I've done this work before, it's better for the comrades to wear them."

    Intimately Close
    Li Jingying, Vice Minister of Supervision, and others arrived at the construction site and said with a smile to the squad leader, "Quickly assign us to a squad, we'll do whatever you want us to do!" The squad leader had already studied their work and asked them to level the roads and tidy up the earth baskets. At this time, they were a little "disobedient," they felt that it was too easy and insisted on doing the earth-carrying work. When Li Jingying was carrying earth, he filled the baskets every time. The comrades advised him to carry less, and he replied, "I can do heavy work in the first place." He carried a lot and walked fast, and also constantly cared for the comrades, advising everyone to pay attention to their health and rest when they were tired. During the break, the vice-ministers, directors, and ordinary cadres sat around on the sandy ground, talking and laughing. Li Jingying also acted as a "cheerleader," cheering others to sing for everyone. Everyone followed his suggestion, applauding and cheering, completely blending into one.

    Vice Minister Carries Bedding Across the Street
    From June 6 to 8, Wang Jinxiang and Yang Qiqing, Vice Ministers of Public Security, continuously participated in two days of voluntary labor at the reservoir construction site. During these two days, they ate corn buns and pickles with the comrades, and slept together on temporary bunks padded with straw. On June 8, the two vice ministers and some other cadres took a large bus back to Beijing. The bus stopped near Shichahai, about a mile from the dormitory of Vice Minister Wang Jinxiang. After Wang Jinxiang got off the bus, several comrades also got off the bus to help him carry his bedding and send him back, but Wang Jinxiang refused. At this time, Yang Qiqing on the bus called out, "Lao Wang, why don't you take a pedicab!" Wang Jinxiang said "No need, no need" while neatly carrying his bedding, passed through a street, and walked towards the dormitory. At this time, two bureau chiefs on the bus discussed, "Vice Minister Wang is carrying his luggage himself, we must learn from him!" Vice Minister Yang Qiqing also chimed in, "Yes, let's stop and not take a pedicab when we go home, let's see how well we've exercised through labor!" As they said, they got off the bus, carried their luggage, and returned home with a joyful mood of labor victory and a communist spirit.

    普通劳动者的姿态
    ——领导干部到十三陵水库工地义务劳动片断
    本报记者　汪波清
    正像毛主席教导的那样，几个月以来，中央国家机关各部，有六百三十多名部长、副部长、司局长一级的干部，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，奔赴被称为“共产主义熔炉”的十三陵水库工地，同千万水库建设者们同吃、同住、同劳动，显示了崇高的共产主义风格。
    一定要保住红旗
    5月31日晚上，赶到工地来的对外贸易部副部长李哲人等负责干部，分配到一直保持优胜红旗的第七小队参加劳动。李哲人一来就表示他的决心，他对小队长、外贸部秘书刘君培说：“队长同志，服从你的命令，坚决完成任务，一定保住红旗！”劳动开始，李哲人抢着干重活，年青小伙子有的还两人抬一筐石头，而他挑一担。装筐的给他装的少，他总是要求说：“再来几块，再来几块”，别人说行了，他又满有理地说：“一边重一边轻，怎么好挑！”你不给他装，他干脆搁下担子，自己再往里加几块，飞快地挑跑了。他还感到自己干得不足，不停地问人说：“这样干行不行，要保住红旗！”虽然他背上的汗水湿透了背心、衬衣和外衣，但是他一点也不在乎。休息哨子刚吹，李哲人便号召说：“为了保住我们的红旗，长期劳动的同志们休息，今天晚上来的继续干！”大家忘了劳累，一齐应“干”，工作效率一再提高。经过全体同志的奋战，这一夜外贸部八个小队的运土量，一举创造了参加义务劳动以来的新纪录，那面显示胜利的红旗也仍然高高飘扬在第七小队的工地上。
    大家都是一样
    6月8日是星期天。虽然纺织工业部副部长王达成在这天下午要参加一个会议，但是他还是抽上午的时间到水库工地参加了劳动。本来部里的同志考虑到他已年近六十，而且这天下午他还有工作，就劝他到工地做做慰问工作，不必劳动。可是他不答应，他说：“这怎么能成，去就是为了劳动，同大家谈谈用休息的时间就行。”到了工地，王达成把脱下的外衣压在石头底下，很快便加入到紧张劳动的行列里，一会儿抡十字镐挖沙石，一会儿挑担子运石块。运石块时，好几个同志要把自己的垫肩给王达成戴上，他拍拍自己的肩膀说：“不要紧，这活我干过，还是同志们戴着好。
    亲密无间
    监察部副部长李景膺等到了工地，笑嘻嘻地向队长说：“快把我们分到小队去，要我们干什么，我们就干什么！”队长对他们的工作早已作了研究，就让他们平道路和整理土筐，这时候他们有点“不听指挥”，他们嫌那太轻松了，坚决要做挑土工作。李景膺在挑土的时候每回都挑满筐，同志们你一言我一语劝他少挑，他回答说：“我本来就能干重活。”他挑的多，走的快，还不时关照同志们，劝大家要注意身体，累了就休息。休息的时候，副部长、司长和一般干部一起围坐在沙土地上，有说有笑，李景膺还当“啦啦队员”，“啦”别人给大家唱歌，大家随着他的提议，又鼓掌又欢呼，完全打成了一片。
    副部长过街扛铺盖
    从6月6日到8日，公安部副部长汪金祥和杨奇清在水库工地连续参加了两天义务劳动。他们在这两天里，和同志们一起吃窝窝头，吃咸菜，一起睡在垫着稻草的临时通铺上。6月8日，两位副部长又和别的一些干部同坐一辆大汽车回北京城。车到什刹海附近停下了，这里离汪金祥副部长的宿舍约有一里来路。汪金祥下车后，好几个同志也跟着下车，要帮他扛铺盖，送他回去，可是汪金祥怎么也不让，这时在车上的杨奇清招呼道：“老汪，要不坐个三轮车吧！”汪金祥一边说“不用，不用”，一边很利落地扛起铺盖，通过一条街道，向宿舍走去。这时车上的两位局长议论说：“汪副部长自己扛行李，我们要向他看齐！”杨奇清副部长也插上说：“对，我们停会回家也不坐三轮，看我们劳动锻炼得怎么样！”像他们说的那样，他们下车后扛上自己的行李，怀着劳动胜利的喜悦心情，带着共产主义的风格回到家中。
