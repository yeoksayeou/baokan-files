    Climbing Mount Ci'er
    Ye Shengtao

    Mount Ci'er is about three li from the urban area of Zhangjiakou. According to the "Scenic Spots and Historical Sites" compiled by the Municipal Bureau of Culture, this mountain is 1,005 meters above sea level. On the mountain is Yunquan Temple, which was first built in the 26th year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty (1393 AD). Following the mountain's terrain, many halls are built at different heights, none of them very large, and small stone paths wind their way through. Most of the halls enshrine Taoist deities. If we were to identify them according to the "Investiture of the Gods," we could say who is who. The highest hall is the Jade Emperor Hall, which in terms of height, has already exceeded about halfway up the mountain. The Buddhist halls include one with the most Buddha statues. In a small three-room space, there are sculptures and murals, with the Three Buddhas of Past, Present, and Future and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in the center, and Skanda standing on the left, facing inward. Some of us joked that they were probably practicing streamlining and economy, so everyone was squeezed together.

    Mount Ci'er has both a Water Cave and an Ice Cave, located under a stone cliff halfway up the mountain. The two caves can truly be said to be only a short distance apart, but the conditions inside are completely different. In the Water Cave, spring water drips down and accumulates at the bottom, said to be two meters deep, and it does not freeze even in the cold winter. In the Ice Cave, spring water freezes into ice, covered with ash and sand, looking like a flat stone slab when viewed from the outside, and said to never melt even in the hot summer. Being so close, yet with such different temperatures, what is the reason for this? Unfortunately, no one could explain it to us. In front of the two caves are two large willow trees, and a large elm tree extends from a stone crevice to the upper left of the Water Cave, said to be a Yuan elm and a Ming willow. The tree trunks are so large, and the years so long, yet they show no signs of aging, with lush branches and leaves, giving a sense of youthful vigor. The fact that the large elm tree takes root in a stone crevice, receiving little soil, and yet can flourish is especially wonderful. Perhaps it is due to the nourishment from the spring water. Sitting in the shade of the willows, drinking tea made with water from the Water Cave, the taste is sweet and delicious. Residents of Zhangjiakou often come here or to Shuimu Palace, which is about seven li from the urban area, for recreation on their days off.

    The Water Cave and Ice Cave are indeed wonders, and the ancient elm and willow trees are also worth admiring, but from Mount Ci'er, there is another scenery that makes you happy and full of praise, making you think far, far away. Zhangjiakou City is surrounded by mountains on the northeast, west, and all sides. The peaks and ranges overlap, and the mountain colors become fainter with distance. Standing halfway up the mountain, we look out at those peaks, all tinged with green. Is that green grass? No, it is the newly planted trees in recent years, especially during this year's Great Leap Forward. According to the original plan, it would take more than thirty years to completely green those peaks. According to the scale of this year's Great Leap Forward, it will only take three years, that is to say, with two more years of effort, complete greening can be achieved. A certain mountain is the responsibility of a certain organization, and a certain mountain is contracted by a certain school, and all have been taken care of. Before our eyes, the mountains already have a hint of green. Just imagine, two years from now, won't they be as lush as the mountains of Jiangnan? This is something that has never happened since ancient times, a groundbreaking event. Those peaks stand there, and it is impossible to say how many years they have experienced. In such a long time, have they ever had any connection with trees? There is no need to think of ancient people, just think of the time when the Great Wall was built. Soldiers guarding the Great Wall, travelers entering and exiting the Great Wall, generation after generation, I don't know how many people there have been. Among them, who has ever seen those peaks tinged with green, like what we see today? To be honest, I am extremely moved. Without thinking, I composed the following poem:

    Layered peaks and ranges have been thus since ancient times,
    The Great Wall also for two thousand years.
    The scenery in sight is unprecedented in history,
    New green trees are planted all over the myriad mountains.

    登赐儿山
    叶圣陶
    赐儿山距离张家口市区三里光景。据市文化局所编的“名胜古迹”，这座山海拔一千零五公尺，山上有云泉寺，始建于明朝洪武二十六年（公元1393年）。随着山势，高高低低建筑好些殿宇，都不怎么大，石级小道曲折可通。多数殿宇里供奉道教的神像，如果按“封神榜”来指认，该说得清谁是谁。最高的一座殿宇是玉皇殿，就高度说，大约已经超过半山腰。佛教的殿宇，有一座里佛像最多。小小的三间，有塑像，有壁上的画像，三世如来和地藏菩萨在正中，韦驮站在左边，面朝内。我们几个人戏言，他们大概是厉行精简节约，故而大家挤在一块儿。
    赐儿山上有水洞冰洞，在半山腰石崖下。两个洞真可以说相距咫尺，可是洞里的情形完全不一样。水洞里泉水下滴，积在洞底，据说有两公尺深，寒冬也不冻结。冰洞里泉水结成冰，上面盖着灰沙，望进去好像铺一块平石板，据说炎夏也不融化。相距那么近，而温凉互异，这是什么道理，可惜没有人给我们作解释。两个洞的前边有两棵大柳树，水洞左上方的石隙中伸出一棵大榆树，相传是元榆明柳。树身那么大，历年那么久，毫无衰老意味，枝叶繁茂，叶色葱绿，给人一种青春盛年的印象。那棵大榆树生根在石隙中，得不到多少土，而能欣欣向荣，尤其奇妙。或许是得到泉水的滋润之故吧。坐在柳荫下，喝水洞里的水沏的茶，其味甘美。张家口市的居民，逢到休假的日子，常到这里或是距离市区七里光景的水母宫玩儿。
    水洞冰洞果然奇，古老的榆树柳树也值得欣赏，但是在这赐儿山上眺望，还有一种景色叫你欢喜赞叹，想得很远很远。张家口市东北西三面全是山，峰峦重叠，山色越远越淡。我们站在半山腰，远望那些峰峦，全都染上绿色。那绿色是草吗？不是，是近几年来尤其是今年大跃进中新栽的树。照原来的计划，全部绿化那些峰峦需要三十多年。照今年大跃进的规模，可只要三年，就是说，再加上两年工夫，就可以做到全部绿化了。某一座山归某机关负责，某一座山归某学校包下来，全都有了着落。眼前已经是山山有绿意，试想两年以后，不将像江南的山一样地郁郁葱葱吗？这是自古以来没有的事，是破天荒的事。那些峰峦耸起在那里，也说不清经历了多少年，在那么悠久的时间里，那曾跟树木有过缘分？也不必想到远古的人，只从修筑了长城那时候想起，戍守长城的兵士，进出长城的行旅，历代以来不知道有多少人，他们中间谁曾见过那些峰峦染上绿色，像今天我们所见到的？说真的，我感动极了，不待思索，作成如下一首诗：
    叠岭重峰自古然，
    长城亦复二千年。
    望中景色空前史，
    绿树新栽遍万山。
