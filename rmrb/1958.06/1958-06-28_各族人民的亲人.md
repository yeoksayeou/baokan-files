　　"Reasonable Sluice Gate"

　　Yuepu Lake is the driest county in the Kashgar River basin, which is perennially short of rain. Uygur farmers used "tears to water the land" to describe the difficulty of farming without water before liberation. Because they could not get life-saving water, hundreds of families in the county were displaced and fled to other places before liberation. The remaining 50,000 farmers who were unwilling to leave their homes had an average of only 200 jin of grain per person per year, living in a state of semi-starvation.

　　After liberation, Han cadre Su Laoquan was sent here to serve as deputy county head. He deeply felt the importance of water conservancy. He led water conservancy cadres around all year round to survey water sources and design projects. Then he worked with the farmers, rolled up his trouser legs, built canals, carried soil, and installed sluice gates to release water. Sometimes he fainted due to illness and weakness, but he only drank some water and continued to work. In this way, in just five or six years, the irrigated area in Yuepu Lake County expanded from 100,000 mu to more than 200,000 mu, fundamentally changing the face of drought.

　　With water sources available, reasonable water distribution became an important issue. Before liberation, armed conflicts occurred here for years due to water disputes, and countless people were killed or injured. Therefore, with the support of Su Laoquan, Yuepu Lake County began to build a sluice gate to distribute water to farmers in various districts. During this period, Su Laoquan lived on the construction site for two consecutive months. He carefully designed the sluice gate based on the length of the canals in each district, the amount of land, and the soil leakage. He couldn't sleep peacefully at night until all the gate openings were completed.

　　One late night, Su Laoquan suddenly heard the roar of the river and quickly put on his clothes and rushed to the sluice gate. He shone his flashlight and realized that a flash flood was coming. If the backwater gate planks were not removed immediately, the flood would destroy the sluice gate that had been painstakingly built for dozens of days. More seriously, thousands of acres of farmland downstream would suffer from flooding. At this critical moment, Su Laoquan jumped into the turbulent flood without regard for his own safety and pulled down the gate planks. He himself was swept away by the flood. People rescued him, but he was still worried about the sluice gate. He didn't breathe a sigh of relief until he saw the flood being tamely discharged from the backwater gate with his own eyes.

　　From then on, farmers throughout the county felt that the water use in each district was fair, so they named this gate the "Reasonable Sluice Gate."

　　"Let Us Also See This Han Girl"

　　In the workshops of the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory, Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Xibe, and other ethnic minority female workers can be seen skillfully working everywhere. They are the first batch of modern textile female workers from ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. More than four years ago, most of these female workers were still rural girls who had not only never seen textile machines, but some had not even heard of using machines to weave cloth. After they came to the factory, they were taught techniques one by one by the Han female workers who came from Shandong the earliest. Uyghur female worker Zaoranmu was a girl who came from Suiding Rural Area only last September. Now she can independently look after four hundred and forty weft yarn spindles. Zaoranmu often affectionately calls Han female worker Li Zao Hui "dear sister." This female worker was the master worker designated by the factory to teach Zaoranmu when she entered the factory. Li Zao Hui taught her hand-in-hand for nearly two months since Zaoranmu entered the factory. In order to let Zaoranmu master the technology as soon as possible, Li Zao Hui, like all the Han female workers who helped ethnic minorities, in addition to guiding her beside the machine, also used her rest time to go to Zaoranmu's dormitory every day to talk with her and correct the mistakes she made in the workshop that day. Li Zao Hui taught Zaoranmu until she could work completely independently.

　　Zaoranmu wrote all this in a letter to her mother and brother who worked in Karamay. A reply came, filled with gratitude to the Han girl. It said that there had never been a textile factory in our Xinjiang in the past. Now the Communist Party leads us to build factories and specially sends Han workers to train our ethnic minority workers. She was told to listen to Li Zao Hui like she listened to her own sister and work hard to learn from Li Zao Hui. She was repeatedly instructed to send a group photo of her and Li Zao Hui, "Let us also see this Han girl."

　　"Your Home Is My Home"

　　On the Weiyelake Pasture in the Kunlun Mountains of Aqan District, Qiemo County, lives a Uyghur herdsman. Last July, this herdsman's wife had persistent bleeding after childbirth, and there were no neighbors nearby. The herdsman panicked and rode to the district health center to request emergency treatment. Doctor Huang Yuquan immediately took medicine and a Uyghur youth assistant, Aisha, to go together. When they arrived, the parturient woman was already unconscious due to excessive bleeding. Huang Yuquan treated her carefully for a day or two, and her condition gradually improved. The herdsman then asked Huang Yuquan to stay for a few more days, both to take care of his patient and to take care of his three children on his behalf, so that he could find time to drive the flock of sheep grazing in the back mountain back. Huang Yuquan readily agreed at the time, saying, "Don't worry, your home is my home." After four or five days, the herdsman drove the flock of sheep back from the back mountain, and Huang Yuquan left the pasture. The herdsman was endlessly grateful and sent him off for a whole day. Why would the herdsmen trust Han cadres so much? It turns out that this Communist Party member Huang Yuquan, who came from a poor background, has long been the most beloved relative of nearly a thousand Uyghur herdsmen in this area. From 1953 to now, he has often carried a medicine bag and rode a horse on a medical tour, traveling all over this pastoral area, which is more than 1,500 miles long from east to west. In order to rescue patients, he once walked through the icy Daban Mountain at night with snow up to his knees, and he also squatted in a cold stone cave overnight. For every patient he treated, he always stayed until the patient was out of any danger before leaving. Before leaving, he always repeatedly told the owner how to take care of the patient; at the same time, he also told the owner where he was going, in case the condition changed and he could be found. He not only cared about patients, but also helped the local people with firewood, carrying water, and solving other problems that could be solved every time he went to a place. Therefore, as soon as the herdsmen heard that Huang Yuquan was coming to their pasture, they would clean up their tents and cook meat early to wait for him.

    各族人民的亲人
    “合理闸”
    岳普湖是终年缺雨的喀什噶尔河流域最干旱的县份。维吾尔农民用“眼泪浇地”来形容他们解放前种地缺水的困难。因为得不到活命的水，解放前全县有成百上千户农民流离失所，逃亡外地。剩下五万多个不愿离开家乡的农民，平均每人每年只有二百斤粮食，过着半饥饿的生活。
    解放后，汉族干部苏老泉被派到这里担任副县长，他深深感到办水利的重要，一年四季带领水利干部东奔西走，勘查水源、设计工程，然后又和农民一起，挽起裤角、修渠抬土、安闸放水。有时因疾病和体弱昏倒了，他只喝些水，又支持着起来工作。就这样，短短五、六年时间，岳普湖县水浇地从十万亩扩大到二十多万亩，根本改变了干旱的面貌。
    水源有了，合理分水就成了重要问题。解放前这里因为水利纠纷连年发生械斗，不知道死伤了多少人。因此，在苏老泉的支持下，岳普湖县又动工修建一座向各区农民分水的分水闸。这期间，苏老泉一连在工地上住了两个月，他根据各区渠长渠短、土地多少、土壤渗漏状况，细心设计分水闸。闸口没有全部修成，他晚上睡觉也不安宁。
    一天深夜，苏老泉忽然听见河水怒吼，连忙披衣奔向闸口。用手电筒一照，坏了！山洪下来了。当时如果不立即抽掉退水闸木板。眼看洪水就会把几十天辛苦修筑的分水闸冲坏。更严重的是下游成千上万亩农田将遭受水灾。这时，苏老泉不顾生命危险，一下跳进急湍的洪水中，闸板抽下了，他自己也被洪水卷走了。人们把他救了出来，他还不放心水闸。直到亲眼看见洪水从退水闸驯服地排走，他才松了一口气。
    从此全县农民都感到各区用水再公平不过了，因此给这个闸起名叫“合理闸。” 
    “让我们也见见这位汉族姑娘”
    在新疆七一棉纺织厂的各个车间里，到处都可以看到维吾尔、哈萨克、回、锡伯等少数民族女工在熟练地工作着。他们是新疆第一批少数民族现代化纺织女工。四年多以前，这些女工绝大部分还是农村姑娘，不仅没有见过纺织机器，甚至有些人连应用机器织布的事也没有听过。她们来到工厂后，由最早从山东来的汉族女工一个个手把手教给了她们掌握技术。维吾尔族女工枣然木是去年9月才从绥定农村来的姑娘，现在已能单独看四百四十个纬纱纱锭。枣然木经常亲热地称呼汉族女工李早慧“亲姐姐”，这个女工就是枣然木进工厂时，工厂指定教她的女师傅。李早慧从枣然木进厂时起，就手把手地教了她近两个月。为了让枣然木尽早掌握技术，李早慧和所有帮助少数民族的汉族女工一样，除了在机器旁边指导外，每天还利用休息时间到枣然木的宿舍里同她谈话，校正当天车间操作过程中做错的地方。李早慧就这样教到枣然木能完全独立工作。
    枣然木把这一切写信告诉了妈妈和在克拉玛依工作的哥哥。回信来了，信中充满了对汉族姑娘的感激。并说我们新疆过去从来没有纺织工厂，现在共产党领导我们建立起工厂，又专门派来汉族工人培养我们少数民族工人。叮咛她像听自己姐姐的话一样听李早慧的话，努力向李早慧学习。并再三嘱咐枣然木寄一张她和李早慧的合影来，“让我们也见见这位汉族姑娘。”
    “你的家就是我的家”
    且末县阿昌区昆仑山上的维也拉克牧场上，居住着一户维吾尔族牧民。去年7月这个牧民的妻子产后流血不止，附近又没有一个邻居，这个牧民着了慌，骑马赶到区卫生所要求急救。医士黄钰全马上带着药品和维吾尔族青年助手艾沙一同前往。当他们到达以后，产妇由于出血过多已昏迷不醒。黄钰全进行了一两天的细心治疗，使她的病情逐渐好转。牧民便又要求黄钰全再住几天，一面替他护理病人，一面代他照管三个孩子，好让他抽出身把放牧在后山里的羊群赶回来。当时黄钰全满口答应说：“你放心去吧，你的家就是我的家”。过了四、五天后，牧民从后山把羊群赶回来，黄钰全才离开牧场。这个牧民感激不尽，一直送了他一天的路程。为什么牧民会这样信托汉族干部呢？原来这个贫民出身的共产党员黄钰全，早已成为这个区近一千户维吾尔族牧民最敬爱的亲人。从1953年到现在，他经常背着药包，骑着马巡回医疗，走遍了这个东西长达一千五百多里的牧区。为了抢救病人，他曾经深夜徒步翻过了大雪没膝的冰大板，也曾经彻夜蹲在冰冷的石洞里过夜。凡是经他治疗的病人，他总是一直守到病人没有任何危险时才离开。离开前，他总要再三叮咛主人，如何护理病人；同时还把自己要去的地方也告诉给主人，以防万一病情发生变化好去找他。他不仅关怀病人，每到一个地方还帮着当地的老乡打柴、担水和解决其他能够解决的问题。因此，牧民们只要一听见黄钰全快到他们的牧场来了，就老早打扫好帐篷、煮好肉等着他。
