　　Moscow's "Children's World"
    This June marks the first anniversary of the opening of Moscow's "Children's World" store. Muscovites are very fond of this store, calling it "a precious gift from the Party to the happy descendants."

    Moscow's "Children's World" is a large store with more than 150 sales departments spread across four floors. It can accommodate tens of thousands of customers at the same time. There are more than 3,500 kinds of children's products, from items for newborns to necessities, food, and toys for tenth-grade students.

    "Children's World" receives an average of more than 250,000 customers every day. Now, with International Children's Day approaching, there are even more customers, sometimes exceeding 300,000 a day.

    In the "Children's World" store, it is evident that the store considers the customers in every aspect. To make it convenient for two- or three-year-olds and their parents to shop, the first floor offers products and toys for children under four years old. In addition, all items for sale are placed on fixed counters and shelves, making it easy for customers of all ages to choose freely. Customers can simply pay and take the goods they like, which is very convenient.

    The store also has a customer service department, a food and beverage department, a transportation department, a luggage storage department, a telephone ordering department, and so on. The most interesting is the temporary childcare department, located in three spacious rooms on the first floor. One room is furnished with toys of all sizes, one room has several small wire beds, and the other is a nursing room equipped with hot water, milk, and other beverages. If the child is tired, hungry, or the customer wants to temporarily entrust the child to someone, they can send the child to the childcare department and hand them over to the nannies who specialize in taking care of children.

    "Children's World" is also a "school" for children's labor education. Many sales departments have specialized technical instructors who teach children various labor skills. For example, in the department selling radio and crystal radio parts, there are radio technicians who voluntarily teach, and children can learn assembly and repair techniques. In the girls' fabric department, there are people who teach girls how to cut and sew clothes. These departments are always crowded with young customers. (Dai) (Attached picture)

　　莫斯科的“儿童世界”
    到今年6月，莫斯科“儿童世界”商店开始营业整一年了。莫斯科人非常喜欢这个商店，他们称它为“党给幸福后代的珍贵礼品”。
    莫斯科“儿童世界”规模很大，它有一百五十多个售货部，分设在四层楼的大厅里，同一时间可以接待上万的顾客。这里有三千五百多种儿童用品，从刚出世的婴儿到十年级学生用的、吃的、玩的，这里应有尽有。
    “儿童世界”每天平均接待二十五万多顾客，现在，国际儿童节即将来到了，顾客更多。有时一天多到三十万以上。
    在“儿童世界”商店里，可以看出商店处处为顾客着想。为了照顾两三岁的小孩和他们的爸爸妈妈买东西方便，在一楼供应的是四岁以下的孩子的用品和玩具。此外，这里所有出售的物品都安放在固定的柜台和架子上，便于大、小顾客自由挑选，凡是合意的，一手交钱，一手取货，非常方便。
    商店里还专设有顾客服务部、饮食部、交通工具部、货物寄存部、电话订货部等等。而最有趣的要算临时托儿部了。它设在第一层楼的三个宽敞的大房间里。一个房间摆设着大小各种玩具，一个房间放着几张钢丝小床，另一间是热水、牛奶等饮料齐全的喂奶室。如果孩子疲倦了，饿了，或者顾客愿意把孩子暂时寄托一下，都可以把孩子送到托儿部来，交给专门照顾孩子的阿姨。
    “儿童世界”还是孩子们劳动教育的“学校”。这里许多售货部设有专门的技术指导员，教孩子各种劳动技术。例如，出售收音机和矿石机零件的部门，就有无线电技工人员义务教授，孩子们可以学习装配和修理的技术。在女孩衣料部，有专人教导女孩子裁剪和缝制衣服。这些部门总是被小顾客挤得满满的。　（戴）（附图片）
