    Bacterial Warfare Criminals
    According to American newspapers, the commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, Creasy, not without regret, said in a speech before the Congressional Defense Committee not long ago: "Since World War I, chemical weapons have not yet demonstrated their military effectiveness." Then he shamelessly claimed that once a third world war breaks out, he and his bacteria would fill this gap in war history.
    First of all, Creasy lied. The U.S. invading forces in Korea did use this weapon in violation of international law. The fact that the head of the U.S. invading forces in Korea, Ridgway, was known as the "Bacterial General" is clear evidence. Secondly, Creasy hopes that a third world war will come soon so that he can become a "hero," which is the ranting of a warmonger. The people of all countries will never agree to this. All that Creasy can do is put his name on the list of bacterial warfare criminals.

    细菌战犯
    据美国报刊报道，美陆军化学兵团司令克里西不久以前在国会国防委员会上的发言中，不无惋惜地说：“自从第一次世界大战以来化学武器还不曾显示它的军事效用。”接着他便大言不惭地声称：一旦爆发第三次世界大战，他和他属下的细菌将会填补战争史上的这个空白。
    首先，克里西撒谎了。美国侵朝军队就曾使用过这种违反国际公法的武器。人称美国侵朝军头子李奇微为“细菌将军”，就是明证。其次，克里西盼望第三次世界大战早日到来，好把他变成“英雄”，这是战争贩子的狂言。世界各国人民是决不会答应的。克里西所能做到的不过是把他的名字填在细菌战犯的名单上而已。
