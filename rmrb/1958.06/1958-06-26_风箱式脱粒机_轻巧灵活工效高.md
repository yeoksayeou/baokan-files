    Bellows-Type Thresher: Lightweight, Flexible, High Efficiency
    Wu Tongchi, the Party branch secretary, and Tang Bangfu, the deputy director of the Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative in Qingxi District, Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province, along with carpenters Zhu Jinfang and Zhu Jinxian, and blacksmiths Zhu Zhigui and Zhu Zhijing, jointly successfully trial-produced a bellows-type thresher. This thresher can thresh all small grains, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, millet, and rapeseed, except for large grains like corn and soybeans. Moreover, it combines threshing and winnowing in one process, increasing work efficiency tenfold.
    The bellows-type thresher is lightweight and flexible, allowing it to be moved to wherever the harvest is taking place. The structure of the bellows-type thresher is also simple, and it can be modified from the original bellows.

    风箱式脱粒机轻巧灵活工效高
    贵州省镇远县青溪区共和农业社的党支部书记吴通迟、社副主任唐邦福和木工朱仅方、朱仅先，铁工朱致贵、朱致敬，共同试制成功了一种风箱式脱粒机。这种脱粒机除大粒粮食，如包谷、黄豆不能脱粒外，其他小粒的如稻谷、麦子、高粱、小米、油菜等，都能脱粒。而且连打带箱只要一道工序，提高工效十倍。
    风箱式脱粒机，轻巧灵活，那里收割就可以推到那里。风箱式脱粒机构造也简单，可以用原来的风箱改制。
