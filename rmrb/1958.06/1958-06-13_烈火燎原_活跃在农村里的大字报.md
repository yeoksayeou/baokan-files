    Prairie Fire

    ——Large Character Posters Active in the Countryside
    Xiao Chengliang
    Some agricultural production cooperatives in Huinan and Fusong counties in Jilin Province have begun to put up large character posters. Many comrades are wondering: Large character posters work in government offices, schools, and industrial and mining enterprises, but can they work in agricultural cooperatives? Do the members like them? ... Whether they work or not, whether they like them or not, let's first take a look at the large character posters written by the farmers! In Qiancheng Cooperative, Xiaochengzi Township, Huinan County, there is such a large character poster:

    Clap the bamboo clapper loud,
    Geng Yunlu is not so proud,
    People get up early to work the land,
    Why don't you lend a hand?

    Carrying a homemade gun, up the hill you roam,
    Startling the pheasants to call out and groan,
    A glance of anger came to be,
    Wiping the gun you fire hastily.

    After this large character poster was put up, it quickly achieved results. A few days later, a large character poster praising Geng Yunlu appeared:

    Geng Yunlu is truly not bad,
    Able to accept everyone's advice,
    Used to often loaf around,
    Now he's started to work hard,
    Voluntarily chopping grass,
    To change his lazy name,
    Hoping he keeps it up,
    So the model title can spread his fame.

    What was the members' reaction to these two large character posters? They thought the criticism was correct and the praise was good. They said, "Criticizing the shortcomings and mistakes is right, and praise is also necessary for those who improve."

    Let's look at a large character poster from the Changsheng Cooperative in Ping'anchuan Township criticizing the Party Branch Secretary Liu Yi:

    Liu Yi's bureaucratic air is no small feat,
    Made a desk set, complete,
    Not placed in the cooperative, but at home to keep,
    一心叫社给报销,
    The masses' reaction is not good, indeed.

    After Comrade Liu Yi saw the large character poster, he stated that he would resolutely not have the cooperative reimburse him and made a self-criticism at the meeting, changing his work style.

    The criticism in the large character posters is truly sharp, clear, and vivid, sweeping away the inertia. The masses are mobilized, and more and more problems are exposed, involving all aspects. Here are two large character posters criticizing some people for not doing sanitation work:

    Everyone does sanitation,
    But Liu Yuxuan's wife is not aware,
    Doesn't sweep inside or out,
    She puts the piglets in the house about,
    This bad habit must be quickly changed,
    If she doesn't change, she'll have to make a self-criticism at the conference, arranged.

    Let's look at another one:

    Third team has a Sister-in-law Liang,
    Others work hard at hand,
    But she carries her child all over the land.
    When people tell her to be sanitary,
    She shouts and scolds, contrary.
    Hope everyone doesn't follow her example,
    And hope Sister-in-law Liang changes her mind quick and ample.

    The large character posters in Xiangyang Cooperative, Xiangyang Township, Fusong County, are even more active, especially when using the comparison method of advanced and backward, the effect is even greater. For example, when young member Yu Haichun was late going to the fields in the morning, the masses wrote a large character poster for him:

    Member Yu Haichun,
    Not enthusiastic at all, soon,
    The sun is on his rear,
    Still wrapped in bed, it's clear,
    The director criticized him,
    He still babbles at a whim.

    Young member Fan Chuanjiu, who works well, was written by the masses:

    Fan Chuanjiu, not simple,
    In labor, doesn't idle,
    Gets up early in the morning,
    Returns late in the evening,
    Diligent and hardworking,
    Truly a good model to thing.

    These two large character posters were posted together. Yu Haichun's wife came back from working in the evening and happened to see a group of students surrounding these two large character posters reading them. When she heard it, her face turned red, and she told her father-in-law about it when she got home. During the meal, everyone criticized Yu Haichun's laziness, and the next day he got up early to go to the mountains to work.

    The sixth production team was late going to the mountains in the morning, and the masses wrote a large character poster and posted it on the door of the captain's house:

    The sixth team is really bad,
    The enthusiasm for work is not so glad,
    Go to the mountains late in the morning,
    Finish work early in the evening.

    After the captain saw the large character poster, he immediately convened a meeting of the team leaders to study improvement methods. The next day, it was the earliest team in the entire cooperative to go to the fields. On the same day, the masses wrote another large character poster:

    Comrades of the Sixth Team are heroes,
    Accept advice and change defects,
    Today, the Sixth Team was the earliest to go to the mountains,
    We will compete with the Sixth Team from now on.

    These large character posters encouraged production enthusiasm and accelerated the progress of spring plowing. The members also liked this form of large character posters very much. Some members studied the large character posters during breaks in the fields and wrote them at noon. Those who couldn't write also asked others to write them. Many people also watched the large character posters. The large character posters posted on the same day quickly spread throughout the village, with discussions in the streets and alleys. At night, some people lit small oil lamps to read them. The members reflected, "Large character posters are really good, they reduced the number of meetings a lot, and they are really useful." "You can say whatever you want, and talk about whatever you want." "Whoever is criticized must change, and if they don't change, they have to explain the reasons." From the effectiveness of the large character posters, it is indeed a new form of democracy, a lively and vivid form of ideological education. From the process of using large character posters in these two counties, at the beginning, the members also had concerns and were not very used to using them. Some members wrote behind closed doors, posted them secretly, and discussed them secretly, afraid to write their real names... These are not to be feared. As long as the Party strengthens its leadership and strengthens political and ideological work, believes in the majority of the masses, clarifies the truth, and cadres boldly change and set an example, the masses will dispel their concerns and boldly use the form of large character posters to promote the development of production.

### 烈火燎原——活跃在农村里的大字报

    烈火燎原
    ——活跃在农村里的大字报
    萧承良
    吉林辉南、抚松县有一些农业生产合作社开始贴出了大字报。有不少同志在怀疑：大字报在机关、学校、工矿企业行，在农业社能行吗？社员喜欢吗？……。行不行，喜欢不喜欢，请先看看农民写的大字报吧！在辉南县小城子乡前程社有这样一份大字报：
    打竹板响呱呱，耿云禄不像话，人家起早把活干，你为什么不参加？
    拿着土炮满山爬，吓的野鸡叫喳喳，用眼一看来了气，抹过枪来就一下。
    这张大字报贴出以后，很快收到了效果。过了几天便出现表扬耿云禄的大字报：
    耿云禄真不善，能够接受大家意见，以前常常偷懒，现在也开始猛干，自愿铡草，要把懒名改变，希今后干到底，让模范称号来流传。
    社员们对这两张大字报的反映怎么样呢？他们认为批评的对，表扬的好。说：“批评的是缺点、错误，改得好也得表扬。”
    再看一张平安川乡长胜社社员批评党支部书记刘义的大字报：
    刘义官气真不小，办公桌子做一套，社里不放家里搁，一心叫社给报销，群众反映可不好。
    刘义同志看到大字报以后，表示坚决不让社里报销了，并在会上做了检讨，转变了作风。
    大字报的批评真是尖锐、鲜明、生动，把暮气一扫而光，群众发动起来，问题揭发的越来越多，涉及到各个方面。这里有两张大字报是批评有些人不搞卫生工作的：
    卫生人人搞，就是刘玉宣的老婆不自觉，屋里屋外都不扫，她把小猪屋里撂，这种坏习惯马上快改掉，如果再不改大会作检讨。
    再看一张：
    三队有个梁大嫂，别人把活来干，她却抱着孩子满街跑。人家叫她讲卫生，她却骂吵吵。希望大家千万别照学，并希梁大嫂赶快改掉。
    抚松县向阳乡向阳社的大字报更为活跃，特别是运用先进、落后对比方法，作用更大。如青年社员于海春早晨下地晚，群众就给写了张大字报：
    社员于海春，干活不积极，
    日头晒屁股，他还捂炕席，
    主任批评他，他还乱唧唧，
    青年社员范传久，干活好，群众给写道：
    范传久，不简单，劳动中，不偷闲，早晨起的早，晚间回来的晚，勤苦又能干，真是好模范。
    这两张大字报，同时贴在一起，于海春爱人晚间干活回来，正碰着一群学生围着这两张大字报念，她听见了，脸弄得通红，回到家里就把这件事和老公公说了。吃饭时，大家批评了于海春的懒惰行为，第二天他就早起上山干活了。
    第六生产队早晨上山晚，群众给写了大字报，贴在队长的大门口：
    第六队真糟糕，干活劲头不太高，早晨上山晚，下晚收工早。
    队长看了大字报，立刻召集本队组长开会，研究改进办法，第二天是全社下地最早的一个队。就在这天，群众又给写张大字报：
    六队社员英雄汉，
    接受意见改缺点，
    今天数着六队上山早，
    我们今后要和六队比比看。
    这些大字报，鼓舞了生产干劲，加快了春耕进度。社员们对大字报这种形式也非常喜欢。有的社员在地头休息时，就研究大字报，午间就写，不会写的人也找人写。看大字报的人也很多。当天贴出的大字报，很快传遍全屯，街头巷尾，议论纷纷。夜晚也有人点着小油灯去看。社员们反映说：“大字报真好，少开了不少会，还真顶用。”、“你愿说什么就说什么，愿意讲什么就讲什么。”“对谁批评都得改，不改也得说说原因。”从大字报的实效来看，确实是一种新的民主形式，是一种生动活泼的思想教育形式。从这两个县运用大字报的过程来看，开始时，社员们也有顾虑，运用起来也不大习惯。有的社员关门写，偷偷地贴，偷偷地议论，不敢写真名……。这些都不怕，只要党加强领导，加强政治工作和思想工作，相信群众的大多数，讲清道理，干部大胆的改，引火烧身，群众就会解除顾虑，大胆的运用大字报这种形式，推动生产的发展。
