People's Daily Guangzhou, 12th - Reporter Yang Weiqun reports: The rural rectification and commune consolidation movement is flourishing in Guangdong Province. Big-character posters have been mastered by the broad masses of the countryside and have become a new type of weapon for promoting democracy, driving current production, improving interpersonal relationships, and liberating the minds of cadres and the masses.

    **High Political Enthusiasm of the Masses - An Average of Five Big-Character Posters Written Per Person**

Currently, more than 120 million big-character posters have been posted. Based on 80% of the total agricultural population of the province, an average of five posters have been put up per person. Agricultural cooperatives posting over ten thousand big-character posters are everywhere. People treat the act of posting big-character posters with high political enthusiasm. Regardless of gender or age, those who can write do so themselves, and those who cannot ask others to write for them. The content of the big-character posters includes criticism, praise, self-criticism, rationalization proposals, questions, and answers. The forms include mountain songs, cartoons, ballads, doggerel, and three-character classics, among others. The big-character posters include opinions from commune members to cadres, commune members to commune members, cadres to commune members, and cadres to cadres. There is even mutual criticism between spouses, siblings, and parents and children within families. All these big-character posters expose the problems existing in various tasks of the agricultural cooperatives and the contradictions existing between cadres and commune members and between commune members. At the same time, they also reflect the people's desire to solve these problems and contradictions. The big-character posters are generally written sharply, accurately, and understandably. Therefore, they are powerful and effective, and the masses call them promotion posters.

    **Refuting the "Three Regardless" and Promoting the Great Leap Forward in Production**

Big-character posters play a significant role in promoting current production. Regarding rectification and commune consolidation, people first focused their attention on how to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice and do a good job in preparing for late rice planting. In the agricultural cooperatives of Buqian Township, Heyuan County, more than 7,950 mu of third-class rice grew short and withered. During the airing of views, commune members immediately posted more than 10,000 big-character posters on this issue. The commune committees of each cooperative immediately solicited opinions from the masses and organized forces to apply topdressing twice, upgrading the vast majority of third-class rice to first-class or second-class rice. In many agricultural cooperatives in Sihui County, people inserted big-character posters into fields of third-class and first-class rice to carry out criticism and praise, urging those lagging production teams to catch up quickly. About 20% of the area sown in the Shantou, Huiyang and other regions was third-class rice, most of which was salvaged and improved in time due to the criticism of big-character posters. The central task of late rice preparation is fertilizer accumulation. Various regions and agricultural cooperatives have grasped the issue of fertilizer accumulation. Through big-character posters, they launched airing of views and debates, refuting the "Three Regardless" (no source of fertilizer, no time, no labor) among some of the masses and cadres. For example, a member of the Wan’dong Third Cooperative in Sihui County lacked confidence in accumulating 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu. After reading the big-character posters, he said: Even if all the labor force is invested in finding fertilizer, it will take until the 12th lunar month to achieve the three targets. The masses immediately posted dozens of big-character posters to criticize his conservative thinking and, while debating, found 153 sources of fertilizer, triggering a high tide of fertilizer accumulation. In addition, various regions and agricultural cooperatives have also used big-character posters to expose the backward phenomena of management that do not adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, and actively carried out rectification.

    **New Look in Interpersonal Relationships - A Lively Atmosphere of Democracy Everywhere**

Big-character posters have promoted a lively atmosphere of socialist democracy everywhere in the countryside, and the relationships between people have taken on a new look. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have adopted the method of combining top-down, bottom-up, left and right mutual combination to conduct airing of views and rectification. Cadres take the lead in setting themselves on fire, and influence the masses with practical actions of rectification. Guo Guansha, director of the Meihua Cooperative in Heyuan County, had always been seriously bureaucratic, and the masses had many opinions about him. This time, during the airing of views, the commune members wrote big-character posters criticizing him. He immediately changed, and the commune members happily said: "In the past, calling him three times wouldn't get a response once, but now calling him once gets three responses. Big-character posters are really effective, they have even changed his character." Liu Changfu, captain of the Mache Cooperative in Zengcheng County, used to beat his wife and scold his mother, which was almost his daily routine, and other people's persuasion and criticism of him were ineffective. The masses discussed behind his back, saying: "If you want Liu Changfu to change, unless stones float on water." However, this time, during the airing of views, his wife posted a big-character poster about him, and he immediately changed. Many cadres originally had concerns about setting themselves on fire, but once they were determined to rectify, they gained the understanding and support of the masses. The masses said: "Now the cadres have changed, we must also listen to the cadres." Under the sharp edge of the criticism of big-character posters and the influence of cadres taking the lead in rectification, the commune members of agricultural cooperatives in various places have to varying degrees appeared "five changes": the original activists have become more active, the original backward commune members have become activists, those who used to cut corners have become good at work quality, those who used to steal public property have become fond of the cooperative, and the original lazy people have also become diligent. Therefore, the agricultural cooperatives have become more and more consolidated. Heyuan County compared the situation of 345 cooperatives before and after the rectification and commune consolidation: Class One cooperatives changed from 37% to 70%, Class Two cooperatives changed from 40% to 20.5%, and Class Three cooperatives changed from 23% to 9.5%. During the rectification and commune consolidation, many agricultural cooperatives, while solving specific problems in current production and management, also launched debates on the two lines of "more, faster, better, and more economical" versus "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" through the airing of views in big-character posters, criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking that "if you want more and faster, you cannot be good and economical" and "the realization of agricultural mechanization depends entirely on state loans."

The rural rectification and commune consolidation movement in Guangdong Province was fully launched more than 20 days ago. When starting this movement, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized mobilizing the masses to fully use the new type of weapon of big-character posters, and regarded the number of big-character posters as an important sign of the breadth and depth of the movement. At present, the movement is still unfolding extensively and deeply. It is expected that by the end of the movement, the number of big-character posters posted will reach 200 million to 300 million.

### 一亿二千万张大字报表现了伟大的共产主义风格  广东农民掌握发扬民主的新武器

    一亿二千万张大字报表现了伟大的共产主义风格
    广东农民掌握发扬民主的新武器
    本报广州12日电　记者杨伟群报道：广东省农村整风整社运动蓬勃开展，大字报已经被农村里广大群众所掌握，成为发扬民主的新式武器，推动着当前的生产，改善着人与人之间的关系，解放了干部和群众的思想。
    群众政治热情高涨  每人平均写五张大字报
    现在，已贴出大字报一亿二千多万张，按照全省农业总人口的80％计算，平均每人贴出了五张。贴出上万张大字报的农业社，到处都是。人们以高度的政治热情来对待贴大字报这件事，不论男女老少，能写的都自己写，不能写的就请别人代笔。大字报的内容有批评、表扬、自我批评、合理化建议、质问和答复。形式有山歌、漫画、快板、顺口溜、三字经等等。大字报中，有社员对干部、社员对社员提的意见，有干部对社员、干部对干部提的意见，有生产队对生产队提的意见。还有家庭里夫妻、兄妹、父子之间的互相批评。所有这些大字报，揭露了农业社各项工作中存在的问题，揭露了干部与社员和社员与社员之间存在的矛盾；同时，也反映了人们要解决这些问题和矛盾的愿望。大字报一般都写得又尖锐，又确切，又易懂。因此，威力大，效果好，群众管它叫促进报。
    驳倒“三无论”  推动生产大跃进
    大字报对推动当前生产起的作用很大。对于整风整社，人们首先把注意力集中在如何确保早造丰收和搞好晚造备耕的问题上。河源县埔前乡的农业社有七千九百五十多亩三类禾，生长得矮小枯黄，社员在鸣放中一下子对这个问题贴出一万多张大字报，各社的社委会立即征求了群众意见，并组织力量施了两次追肥，使绝大部分三类禾提高为一类禾或二类禾。在四会县的许多农业社，人们把大字报插到三类禾田和一类禾田，进行批评和表扬，促使那些落后生产队迅速追上来。汕头、惠阳等专区的约占播种面积20％的三类禾，大部分由于大字报的批评，及时挽救好转。晚造备耕的中心工作是积肥。各个地区和农业社都抓紧积肥问题，通过大字报，展开了鸣放、辩论，驳倒了部分群众和干部中的“三无论”（无肥源，无时间，无劳力）。如四会县万洞三社，有一个社委对每亩积肥一千担没有信心，看了大字报后，说：即使全部劳动力投入去找肥，也要搞到旧历12月才能达到三个指标。群众随即贴出几十张大字报批驳他的保守思想，并边辩论边找肥源，结果发现一百五十三种肥源，掀起了积肥高潮。此外，各个地区和农业社还通过大字报，揭露经营管理不适应生产大跃进形势的落后现象，积极进行整改。
    人与人的关系面貌一新  到处出现活跃的民主气氛
    大字报促使农村到处出现一片活跃的社会主义民主气氛，人与人之间的关系面貌一新。各地农业社采取上下左右互相结合的办法进行鸣放和整改。干部带头引火烧身，并以整改的实际行动影响群众。河源县梅花社主任郭官沙，一向官气严重，群众意见很大。这次鸣放中，社员写大字报批评他，他立即改变了，社员很高兴地说：“过去叫三声不应一声，现在叫一声应三声。大字报真顶事，把人的性格都改变了。”增城县麻车社队长刘长辅，过去打妻子、骂母亲，几乎成为他的家常便饭，别人对他劝解和批评都无效。群众背后议论说：“要想刘长辅改变，除非石头浮水。”但是，这次鸣放中，他的妻子贴了他的大字报，他马上改变过来了。很多干部原来对引火烧身有顾虑，但一经下决心整改之后，都获得群众的谅解和拥护。群众说：“现在干部都改了，我们也要好好听干部的话。”在大字报的批评锋芒和干部带头整改的影响下，各地农业社的社员中不同程度的出现了“五变”：原来的积极分子变得更积极，原来的落后社员变为积极分子，原来常偷工减料的变为工作质量好，原来常偷窃公共财产的变得爱社了，原来的懒汉、懒妇也变得勤快了。因此，农业社越发巩固起来。河源县三百四十五个社对比整风整社前后的情况：一类社由37％变为70％，二类社由40％变为20.5％，三类社由23％变为9.5％。整风整社中，很多农业社在解决当前生产和经营管理上的具体问题的同时，还通过大字报的鸣放，对于“多快好省”与“少慢差费”两条路线展开辩论，批驳那种认为“要多要快就不能又好又省”和“要实现农业机械化全靠国家贷款”的右倾保守思想。
    广东省农村整风整社运动是在二十多天前全面铺开的。在开始开展这个运动的时候，中共广东省委就强调发动群众来充分运用大字报这个新式武器，并把大字报的数量作为运动广度、深度的一个重要标志。目前，运动还在广泛而深入地展开，预计到运动结束时，贴出的大字报将达两亿张到三亿张。
