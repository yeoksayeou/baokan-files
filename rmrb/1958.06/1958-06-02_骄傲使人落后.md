　　Pride Leads to Backwardness
　　Tian Xiying
    Through continuous inspections and comparisons during the spring plowing season, a good atmosphere of advanced units, catching up with advanced units, and comparing who can do more, faster, better, and more economically has been formed in rural middle schools. In the tide of the Great Leap Forward, many backward regions and units are speeding up their efforts to catch up with advanced regions and units, which is a good phenomenon. This is of great benefit to promoting overall agricultural production. However, some units that were originally more advanced have experienced the opposite phenomenon. After the Third Agricultural Cooperative of Dongshan Township in Changning County, Hunan Province, was rated as an advanced cooperative, the labor attendance rate once dropped significantly. The model cooperative of Qin County, Shanxi Province—the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative—had planned to apply 100 dan of fertilizer per mu before the year, but only half of it was completed when spring plowing began. Some cooperatives, after being listed as advanced units, saw pride arise among their leadership. Some cadres said: Even if we sleep for a few days, other cooperatives won't be able to catch up. Some said: Our land is good, so achieving the targets is no problem. Some said: We are a good cooperative, as long as other cooperatives can achieve it, we can achieve it too. Others said: Our fertilizer sources are exhausted, and our labor force is insufficient, so the target only needs to be slightly higher than last year. This complacency made them relax their leadership over production.
    Pride leads to backwardness. Any advanced region or advanced person, once they develop a sense of pride, will find it difficult to continue moving forward. The objective conditions in some advanced regions are relatively superior. However, the quality of objective conditions does not play a decisive role in whether one is advanced or backward. The decisive factor is mainly people's subjective efforts. Why is it that some regions with very poor conditions are doing well in production, while some regions with very good conditions are not doing so well? This situation shows that if people's subjective initiative is not brought into play, good conditions will not only fail to play a positive role but will instead become a burden in the process of moving forward. This is the reason why good things and bad things can transform into each other.
    The struggle between revolutionary thought and conservative thought is the driving force for the development of socialist cause. Through the education of facts from the great debate and the great production movement since last autumn, people have also made a leap forward in their thinking. However, we cannot therefore think that conservative ideas have been eliminated and that we will not encounter any more obstacles in our progress. People's understanding generally lags behind objective reality. Even in more advanced regions or units, this situation will exist. Here, some people often overemphasize objective difficulties and do not believe in the power of the masses; or they only see the progress in their work and do not see the difficulties and problems. They only compare the present with the past and do not look forward to the future with a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, when they take a slight step forward in their work, they become complacent and develop a sense of reaching the top. Once they encounter difficulties, they think that they have reached the end of the road and there is no way to think of a solution. Therefore, constantly fighting against conservative ideas is an important key to the continuous progress of advanced regions. Hong'an County in Hubei Province is an example of how timely opposition to the conservative ideas of certain cadres enabled cadres and the masses to arm their minds with the spirit of continuous revolution, and work has been continuously leaping forward wave after wave.

　　骄傲使人落后
　　田喜盈
    经过春耕生产中不断的检查评比，农村中学先进、赶先进、比多快好省的风气已经形成。在大跃进的浪潮里，许多落后地区、落后单位都在快马加鞭地追赶先进地区和先进单位，这是好现象。这对推进整个农业生产有很大好处。然而有些原来比较先进的单位，却出现了与此相反的现象。湖南常宁县东山乡第三农业社被评为先进社后，劳动出勤率曾一度大大降低。山西沁县的模范社——东方红农业社，年前就订出每亩施肥百担的计划，到春耕生产开始时才完成了一半。有一些社在列入先进单位以后，领导上产生了骄傲情绪。有的干部说：我们睡几天觉，别的社也赶不上。有的说：我们土地好，实现指标没问题。有的说：我们是好社，只要其他社能达到，我们社也能达到。还有的说：我们这里肥源已尽，劳力不足，指标只要比去年稍高一点就行了。这种自满心理使他们放松了对生产的领导。
    骄傲使人落后。任何先进地区和先进人物，只要一旦产生了骄傲情绪，他们就很难再继续前进。有些先进地区的客观条件是比较优越的。但是客观条件的好坏对于先进和落后来说并不起决定性的作用，起决定性作用的，主要还是人的主观努力。为什么有些条件很差的地区，生产却搞得很好，有些条件很好的地区，生产反而并不太好呢？这种情形说明，如果不努力发挥人的主观能动性，好条件不仅不能起好的作用，反而会变成前进中的包袱。好事坏事能够互相转化的道理就在这里。
    革命思想和保守思想的斗争是社会主义事业发展的动力。通过去秋以来的大辩论和大生产运动的事实教育，人们在思想上也有了跃进。但是不能因此便认为保守思想已经扫清，前进中不会再遇到什么阻碍了。人们的认识一般是落后于客观实际的。即使在比较先进地区或单位里，这种情形也会有的。在这里，有一些人往往过分强调客观困难，而又不相信群众的力量；或者只看到工作中的进步方面，看不到困难和问题。他们只是把现在和过去相比，而没有用革命的精神展望将来。因而他们在工作稍为前进一步的时候，就沾沾自喜，产生了到顶思想。一遇到困难，又认为已经山穷水尽，无法可想了。因此，经常和保守思想作斗争，是先进地区不断前进的重要关键。湖北省的红安县就是由于及时反掉了某些干部的保守思想，使干部和群众用不断革命的精神武装了头脑，工作才一浪接一浪地不断向前跃进。
