    Talking About "Wielding the Axe"
    Hong Lin
    After seeing the improved agricultural implements created by many farmer inventors recently, I can't help but think of the ancient craftsman, Lu Ban, and also the saying "wielding the axe in front of Lu Ban's door."
    The saying "wielding the axe in front of Lu Ban's door" comes from Mei Zhihuan's poem. Mei Zhihuan wrote in his poem "On Li Bai's Tomb": "A pile of earth by the riverbank of Caishi, Li Bai's name is as high as the ages. People come and go reciting his poems, wielding a big axe in front of Lu Ban's door." This was his lament, spoken before the dead, feeling a sense of awe and self-reproach.
    Mei Zhihuan's poem has been forgotten, but the saying "wielding the axe in front of Lu Ban's door" has been passed down. When someone wants to express their humble opinion before some expert, master, celebrity, or scholar of the past, they will hear the words: "Don't wield the axe in front of Lu Ban's door here." And the person who wants to express their opinion also feels somewhat inferior. Even if they want to say something, they have to add a humble ending: "I am wielding the axe here."
    The saying "wielding the axe in front of Lu Ban's door" elevates "Lu Ban's door" very high, making people look up to it in awe; and for some people with insufficient knowledge and lower skills, it makes them be honest and not act rashly, not overestimating their abilities. It tells them to see what place this is? In front of whom? How much ability do you have? After thinking it over in this way, they don't even dare to touch the axe, let alone wield it. As a result, they cannot put pen to paper to write articles, they cannot open their mouths to talk about theories, and they cannot move their hands to do things.
    It seems that this idiom has a great influence. Even now, when some people arrive in front of "Lu Ban's door," they are still a little hesitant. Even if they have different opinions, they stammer and find it difficult to speak. If this situation continues to develop, they will not dare to "wield the axe" even when they are not in front of "Lu Ban's door."
    Here, let's not talk about whether those who are considered "Lu Ban's door" are really worthy of being "Lu Ban's door." Just from the point of "wielding the axe," it should be something that everyone can wield and can wield everywhere. Liu Hengjie from Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, is an ordinary member of an agricultural cooperative. He created several kinds of agricultural implements such as ditching plows all at once. Because he wielded the axe so boldly, people call him the "living Lu Ban" of today. Others, such as Wang Yuzhen from Henan, Zhou Yuean from Guangdong, and many other farmer inventors, have not attended any specialized schools, let alone studied abroad, but they boldly picked up the axe and created many new agricultural implements that their predecessors dared not think of or try. They were not bound by that idiom, and they did not think: "Such technical matters should be consulted with those technical experts, we can't do it." Therefore, they became the real "Lu Ban."
    The saying "wielding the axe in front of Lu Ban's door" has restrained the thinking of many people, making them feel inferior, making them shrink back, and making them lose their creativity! Now, we want to put idioms into historical archives. Whether in science and technology, in theoretical research, or in literature and art, we may as well boldly wield the axe and wield the axe more often. The new saying should be: Lu Bans emerge from wielding the axe.

### 谈“弄斧”

    谈“弄斧”
    洪林
    看了最近许多农民发明家创造的改良农具，不禁想起古代的巧匠——鲁班，也不禁想起“班门弄斧”这句话。
    “班门弄斧”这句话出自梅之涣的诗。梅之涣在“题李白墓”诗中写道：“采石江边一堆土，李白之名高千古。来来往往一首诗，鲁班门前弄大斧。”这是他走到死人面前，心有所畏，自愧不如，而发抒的感慨。
    梅之涣的诗是被人忘记了，而“班门弄斧”这句话却流传下来。当有人要在过去什么专家大师名流学者之前，略抒己见的时候，便会听到这样的话：“别在此地班门弄斧了。”而想发表意见的本人，也确是有些自卑，即或要说什么，也得拖上个谦虚的尾巴：“我是在这里弄斧了。”
    “班门弄斧”这句话把“班门”抬得很高，使人望而生畏；而对于一些学识不足、技能稍低的人，则是让他们老实些，别轻举妄动，不自量力。要他们看看这是什么地方？在什么人面前？自己有多大本事？如此这般地三思以后，就连斧头碰也不敢去碰，别说是去舞弄了。于是，写文章下不了笔，谈理论开不了口，办事情动不了手。
    看来这句成语影响不小。即使在现在，有人到了“班门”之前，也还是有些缩手缩脚，明明有不同的意见，亦是嗫嚅难言，这情形再发展下去，就是不在“班门”之前，也不敢“弄斧”了。
    这里且不说那些被认为“班门”者，是否真够得上“班门”。只就“弄斧”一点而论，应该是人人可弄，随处可弄的。陕西省渭南县的刘恒杰是农业社的普通社员，他一下子创造了开沟犁等好几种农具。由于他这样大胆地弄了斧，人们称他为今代的“活鲁班”。其他如河南的王玉振，广东的周岳安，以及许多农民发明家，也都没有上过什么专门学校，更没有出洋留学，但他们果敢地拿起了大斧，创造了许多前人所不敢想、不敢试的新农具。他们没有受那句成语的约束，他们没有以为：“这样技术上的大事，得请教那些技术专家，咱干不来。”因而他们倒成为真正的“鲁班”。
    “班门弄斧”这句话束缚了多少人的思想，使他们自卑，使他们畏缩，使他们失去创造性！如今，我们要让成语进历史档案了。不管在科学技术方面，在理论研究方面，在文学艺术方面，都不妨大胆弄斧，多多弄斧。新的语句应当是：弄斧之中出鲁班。
