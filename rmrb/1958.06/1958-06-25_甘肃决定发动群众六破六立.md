To Revolutionize Nature, We Must First Revolutionize Thought
Gansu Decides to Mobilize the Masses for Six Destructions and Six Establishments
Destroy the theory of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," and establish the theory of "more, faster, better, and more economical"; destroy the theory of "Heaven's timing first," and establish the theory of "man can conquer nature"; destroy the theory that "science and technology are unattainable," and establish the theory that "everyone can master science and technology"; destroy the theory of "production reaching its peak," and establish the theory of "unlimited potential"; destroy the theory of "valuing the ancient and belittling the present," and establish the theory of "valuing the present and belittling the ancient"; destroy metaphysics and idealism, and establish dialectics and materialism.

    (Our dispatch from Lanzhou) The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its Eighth Plenary Committee (enlarged) meeting from June 2nd to 13th. Based on the spirit of the General Line, the meeting examined the guiding ideology.
    This meeting was a thorough rectification meeting and also a meeting to resolutely implement the General Line. The meeting focused on studying the experience and lessons of the "saddle shape." Like the rest of the country, Gansu experienced a "saddle shape" process in the speed of socialist construction over the past three years, namely, a leap forward - slow progress - a great leap forward. The lessons of this "saddle shape" profoundly educated everyone. The comrades attending the meeting seriously examined their ideological state during the "saddle shape." They believed that during the "slow progress," in addition to the agitation of right-wing elements inside and outside the Party, there were also serious or relatively serious right-leaning thoughts among some leading cadres within the Party. They could not see the strength of the masses, underestimated the speed of socialist development, hesitated and wavered, and dampened the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, thus delaying the speed of construction. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the most profound experience and lesson of the "saddle shape" is that we must constantly oppose right-leaning conservative thoughts, break superstitions, and liberate our minds in socialist construction. To revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize thought. Without the liberation of people's minds and without the mobilization of people's enthusiasm, it is unimaginable to implement the General Line. Therefore, the meeting proposed that we must universally plant the proletariat's red flag in people's minds, pull out the bourgeoisie's white flag, break superstitions, and liberate our minds. We must launch a great debate and a great struggle in the leading organs at all levels and among the broad masses, and vigorously promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Based on the situation in Gansu, we need six destructions and six establishments. Namely: destroy the theory of "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," and establish the theory of "more, faster, better, and more economical"; destroy the theory of "Heaven's timing first," and establish the theory of "man can conquer nature"; destroy the theory that "science and technology are unattainable," and establish the theory that "everyone can master science and technology"; destroy the theory of "production reaching its peak," and establish the theory of "unlimited potential"; destroy the theory of "valuing the ancient and belittling the present," and establish the theory of "valuing the present and belittling the ancient"; destroy metaphysics and idealism, and establish dialectics and materialism. Establish a communist style with grand ambitions, rich ideals, and the courage to act.
    The meeting believed that the key to realizing the six destructions and six establishments lies in the leading cadres at all levels completely shedding their bureaucratic airs, fully relying on the masses, and following the mass line. We are currently in a great era where "one day equals twenty years." We must seize every inch of land when planting red flags, and compete for every second when catching up with the advanced. Without mobilizing the masses, these goals cannot be achieved. Therefore, we must fully mobilize the masses, mobilize all positive factors, and serve socialist construction. Cadres at all levels must appear as ordinary laborers, shed their bureaucratic airs, entrust their hearts to the masses, and humbly learn from the masses. Learning from the masses means first learning from the advanced and positive things among the masses, that is, the mainstream things. Where do leadership ideas come from? They come from the active masses. The opinions of the masses are gathered together and then implemented. Many problems that cannot be solved can be solved by handing them over to the masses. For example, running local industries on a large scale and changing the face of drought were solved by mobilizing the masses. Although some people say this in words, they have not truly appeared as ordinary laborers due to their incorrect stance, so only negative and non-mainstream things are reflected in their minds. To grasp the mainstream and essence, and to master objective laws, we must first mobilize the masses. Without mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, the law of diverting the Tao River uphill cannot be mastered. In the final analysis, people are the decisive factor. Politics is the commander, and thought is the soul. Doing a good job in people's ideological transformation, breaking superstitions, and liberating their minds are necessary to exert all-out effort, aim high, and build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
    Based on breaking superstitions and liberating minds, the meeting passed a resolution on "Holding High the Proletariat's Red Flag and Marching Towards Technology and Culture," calling on the people of the province to mobilize, march towards technology and culture, and launch a vigorous, unstoppable, and invincible mass movement that will be broad and sustained, so that the technological revolution and cultural revolution will bloom with brilliant flowers and bear rich fruits.
    The resolution pointed out that industrialization is the primary goal of the revolution and the material foundation for fully launching the technological revolution and cultural revolution. We must continue to resolutely implement the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry. Party committees at all levels must grasp agriculture with their right hand and industry with their left hand, earnestly rely on the masses, and mobilize the whole people to run factories, so that the output value of local industries will exceed the output value of agriculture by 1962. And during the Second Five-Year Plan period, gradually build ten industrial networks in the province, including iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, electricity, coal, petroleum, chemical industry, machinery, building materials, textiles, and light industry, and establish more than twenty new industrial cities. The resolution requires that the iron and steel industry must be placed in the most prominent position. The resolution put forward specific plans for accelerating water conservancy, realizing mechanization, and cultivating scientific and technical personnel in natural sciences, philosophy, social sciences, culture and education, health, and sports.
    The resolution pointed out that to march towards technology and culture, we must put politics in command, it must be led by the Party, and we must follow the mass line. We must organize the province, special districts, counties, cities, and townships to work together, and mobilize millions of masses and the broad masses of intellectuals to work together. We must implement the policy of combining state power with the masses and combining improvement with popularization. Only in this way can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Party committees at all levels must make plans. With plans and measures, we must plan and act at the same time. Guide action with planning, and supplement and revise the plan in action.
    The resolution calls on the people of Gansu Province to ride the wind and waves, follow the General Line, and hold high the proletariat's red flag to bravely march towards technology and culture, and quickly promote the industry, agriculture, and handicrafts of Gansu Province to the level of modern large-scale production, and strive to make more contributions in the struggle to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom.

### 甘肃决定发动群众六破六立

    要革自然的命必先革思想的命
    甘肃决定发动群众六破六立
    破少慢差费论，立多快好省论；破天时第一论，立人定胜天论；破科学技术高不可攀论，立人人可以掌握科学技术论；破增产到顶论，立潜力无穷论；破厚古薄今论，立厚今薄古论；破形而上学和唯心论，立辩证法和唯物论。
    本报兰州讯　中共甘肃省委于6月2日至13日召开了第八次全体委员会（扩大）会议，根据总路线精神，检查了领导思想。
    这次会议是一次深入的整风会议，也是坚决贯彻总路线的会议。会上着重研究了“马鞍形”的经验教训。甘肃和全国各地一样，三年来在社会主义建设速度上，经历了“马鞍形”的过程，即跃进——缓进——大跃进。这个“马鞍形”的教训，深刻地教育了大家。与会同志严肃认真地检查了自己在“马鞍形”中的思想状况。认为在“缓进”中，除党内外右派分子兴风作浪外，在党内若干领导干部中也存有严重或比较严重的右倾思想，看不见群众的力量，对社会主义发展速度估计不足，犹豫动摇，打击了干部和群众的积极性，以致延缓了建设速度。与会同志一致认为，“马鞍形”最深刻的经验教训，就是在社会主义建设中必须时刻反对右倾保守思想，破除迷信，解放思想。要革自然的命，必先革思想的命。没有人的思想解放，没有人的积极性的发挥，要贯彻总路线是不可想像的。因此，会议提出，必须在人们的思想上普遍插起无产阶级的红旗，拔掉资产阶级的白旗，破除迷信，解放思想。在各级领导机关和广大群众中展开大争大辩，大破大立，兴无灭资。根据甘肃情况，需要六破六立。即：破少慢差费论，立多快好省论；破天时第一论，立人定胜天论；破科学技术高不可攀论，立人人可以掌握科学技术论；破增产到顶论，立潜力无穷论；破厚古薄今论，立厚今薄古论；破形而上学和唯心论，立辩证法和唯物论。树立有宏伟的志愿，有丰富的理想，敢作敢为的共产主义风格。
    会议认为实现六破六立的关键，在于各级领导干部彻底打掉官气，充分依靠群众，走群众路线，当前我们正处在“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，插红旗寸土必夺，赶先进分秒必争。若不发动群众，就作不到这些。因此，必须充分发动群众，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义建设服务，各级干部必须要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，打掉官气，把心交给群众，虚心向群众学习。向群众学习，首先是学习群众中先进的积极的东西，即主流的东西。领导主意从何而来？是从积极的群众中来。把群众意见集中起来，再贯彻下去。许多解决不了的问题，交给群众便可以得到解决。如大办地方工业，改变干旱面貌，就是发动群众解决的。有人虽然口头这样说，但由于立场不对头，没有真正以普通劳动者的面貌出现，因此在他们的脑中只反映了消极的非主流的东西。要抓住主流和本质，要掌握客观规律，首先就要把群众发动起来。不把广大农民群众发动起来，引洮河上山的规律是掌握不了的。归根到底人是决定的因素。政治是统帅，思想是灵魂。做好人的思想改造工作，破除迷信，解放了思想，才能鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义。
    会议在破除迷信，解放思想的基础上，通过了一个“高举无产阶级的红旗，向技术、文化进军”的决议，号召全省人民动员起来，向技术和文化进军，掀起声势浩大，势如破竹，所向披靡，广阔持久的群众运动，使技术革命、文化革命开出灿烂的花朵，结出丰硕的果实。
    决议指出：工业化是革命的首要目标，又是全面开展技术革命、文化革命运动的物质基础，必须继续坚决贯彻全党全民办工业的方针。各级党委必须右手抓农业，左手抓工业，认真依靠群众，发动全民办工厂，使地方工业产值在1962年超过农业产值。并在第二个五年计划期间，逐步建成全省的钢铁、有色金属、电力、煤炭、石油、化工、机械、建筑材料、纺织、轻工业等十个工业网，建立二十多个新的工业城市。决议要求必须把钢铁工业放在最突出的地位。决议对加速水利化，实现机械化，以及培养自然科学、哲学、社会科学、文教、卫生、体育等方面的科学技术人员都提出了具体计划。
    决议指出：向技术、文化大进军，必须政治挂帅，必须由党来领导，必须走群众路线。要组织省、专区、县、市、乡各级一齐来干，要动员千百万群众和广大知识分子一齐来干。要实行国家力量和群众相结合，提高和普及相结合的方针。只有这样才能做到多、快、好、省。各级党委都要作出规划。有规划，有措施，边规划，边行动。以规划指导行动，在行动中再补充和修正规划。
    决议号召甘肃全省人民乘风破浪，沿着总路线，高举无产阶级红旗奋勇地向技术、文化进军，把甘肃省工业、农业、手工业，很快推进到现代化的大生产水平上，争取在赶上和超过英国的斗争中有更多的贡献。
