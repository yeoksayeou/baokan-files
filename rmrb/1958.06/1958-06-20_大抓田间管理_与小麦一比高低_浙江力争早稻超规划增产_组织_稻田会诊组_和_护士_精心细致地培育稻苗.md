Our Hangzhou dispatch from the 19th (Reporters You Qi, Yi Xintian, Li Xinmin) reports: A mass movement to "Break through the four barriers of early rice and strive to exceed planned targets in every possible way" is unfolding across Zhejiang Province. The specific targets for breaking through the four barriers are: pests and diseases, third-class seedlings, lack of quick-acting fertilizer, and lodging.

Zhejiang Province has planted over 15.4 million mu of early rice this year. Thanks to deep plowing of the fields, selection of improved varieties, ample fertilizer accumulation, early transplanting, and dense planting, early rice growth is generally good. However, in the face of this favorable situation, some cadres and farmers have become complacent and slack, while others hold conservative and superstitious beliefs such as "No one is completely blessed, and no rice is completely grained," and have relaxed field management. As a result, in the context of higher temperatures, earlier outbreaks of pests and diseases, and prolonged periods of cloudy, rainy, and low temperatures, some rice seedlings transplanted half a month ago have not yet turned green and started to grow. Such third-class seedlings account for about 15% of the total early rice area in the province. Some first-class seedlings, due to excessive basal fertilizer, are growing too vigorously and are at risk of lodging in the future.

To this end, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has convened a series of meetings to sound the alarm against complacency, slackness, paralysis, and conservatism in various regions. At the same time, it has promoted the experience of Lishui County in ensuring seedlings, ears, grains, and yields, and vigorously engaging in field management, requiring all regions to seize every link in agricultural activities and ensure the realization of the original planned output. The experience of Lishui County, after being promoted throughout the province, has played a significant role in strengthening field management of early rice throughout the province. All regions have universally gone deep into the fields to count plants, calculate ears, count grains, and estimate yields, while seizing the day and the hour to carry out early weeding, multiple weeding, topdressing, insect catching, and rational irrigation and drainage.

On the basis of promoting the experience of Lishui County, Shaoxing County has further created many good methods for field management. For example, many "rice paddy consultation groups" have been formed, combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, to "consult" each field and identify its condition, prescribe "local remedies" for each plot, with the advanced finding loopholes and the backward finding reasons, and guaranteeing to cure third-class seedlings within three days. In addition, there are also rice paddy supervisors who act as "nurses," going to the fields once a day to "take their temperature" (checking rice color and inspecting for pests). In this way, Shaoxing County quickly eliminated third-class rice seedlings. In the context of the high production enthusiasm of the masses, Shaoxing County also launched a debate on whether production could leap forward again. After a county-wide debate, it was unanimously agreed that since early rice had already laid a good foundation, it was entirely possible to seize the victory and strive to ensure that every plant produced ears, every ear bore abundant grains, and every grain was full. Therefore, the current issue is not "ensuring production," but "greatly exceeding planned production." Subsequently, Shaoxing County launched a challenge to "exceed planned production" to the whole province, setting off a surging mass movement to break through the four barriers of early rice and greatly exceed planned production in Zhejiang Province in the last ten days.

Since the launch of the movement to greatly exceed planned production, the field management situation of early rice throughout the province has become even more encouraging. In terms of eliminating pests and diseases, most districts and counties have established pest control headquarters, and townships and communes have established pest control brigades, teams, and shock groups. Jiaxing District has also jointly launched tens of thousands of people to jointly encircle and suppress rice borers with Suzhou District in Jiangsu Province for many times. Local methods and remedies have also been fully explored and used for pest control agents. According to the results of a symposium convened by "traveling doctors" and chemical technicians in Wuxing County alone, it was found that there were twenty-three kinds of local medicinal herbs and weeds that could kill insects. All regions in the province have made every effort to produce quick-acting fertilizers on a large scale. For example, Yu杭, Lishui, Yueqing and other counties have already achieved that every commune or every team has a local chemical fertilizer plant. Every field has a ten-thousand-jin pit and compost pool, and every household engages in soil fumigation stoves. Due to the large application of quick-acting fertilizers, third-class fields throughout the province have rapidly improved. Now, the proportion of third-class fields in the province has been reduced from 15% to less than 5%. Through a series of works such as early weeding, multiple weeding, diligent irrigation, shallow irrigation, and topdressing with quick-acting potash fertilizer, the risk of lodging has also been greatly reduced.

The fact that Zhejiang Province has reversed the slogan of "ensuring production" and achieved a situation of greatly exceeding planned production this time is the result of the spirit of the General Line and the fact that the wheat in several northern provinces has had a bumper harvest, liberating people's thinking and inspiring people's enthusiasm. Recently, various regions have greatly revised their original plans. In the past, the original planned yield of early rice was 400 jin per mu, but now it has been changed to 800 jin; the original plan of 500 or 600 jin has now been set to 1,000 jin. Most counties in the province no longer regard 800-jin counties or 1,000-jin counties as this year's goal, but have put forward the slogan of striving to become 1,500-jin counties and double-1,000-jin counties.

### 大抓田间管理  与小麦一比高低  浙江力争早稻超规划增产  组织“稻田会诊组”和“护士”精心细致地培育稻苗

    大抓田间管理  与小麦一比高低
    浙江力争早稻超规划增产
    组织“稻田会诊组”和“护士”精心细致地培育稻苗
    本报杭州19日电　记者尤淇、伊心恬、李新民报道：“大破早稻四道关，千方百计超规划”的群众性运动，正在浙江全省各地展开。大破四关的具体对象是：病虫害关、三类苗关、缺少速效肥关和倒伏关。
    浙江省今年插了一千五百四十多万亩早稻。由于田土深耕、选用良种、积肥充足、插秧提早和插得细密，早稻生长普遍良好。但在这样良好的形势面前，一部分干部和农民有了松劲自满情绪，另一部分人有“人无全福，稻无全谷”的保守迷信思想，放松了田间管理工作。因此，在气温较高、病虫害发生较早和后来长时期阴雨低温的情况下，部分插下了半个月的稻秧还没有转青发棵。像这样的三类苗，竟占全省早稻面积的15％左右。部分一类苗也由于基肥过多，生长过旺，将来有倒伏的危险。
    为此，中共浙江省委曾经召开了一连串会议，向各地敲起了反松劲自满反麻痹保守的警钟，同时向全省推广了丽水县保株、保穗、保粒、保产，大搞田间管理的经验，要求各地抓紧农事活动的各个环节，确保原规划产量的实现。丽水县的经验在全省各地推广以后，对加强全省早稻的田间管理工作起了极大的作用。各地普遍深入田头数株、算穗、点粒、估产，同时抢日抢时地进行早耘、多耘、追肥、捕虫、合理排灌等活动。
    在推广丽水县经验的基础上，绍兴县进一步创造了许多田间管理的好办法。如以社队干部、技术员、老农民三者结合组成很多“稻田会诊组”，逐丘“会诊”，逐丘鉴定，片片开“土方”，先进的找漏洞，落后的找原因，三天内包治三类苗。此外，还有稻田专管员当“护士”，每天一次到田头“量体温”（看稻色查虫害）。这样，绍兴县很快就消灭了三类稻苗。在广大群众生产情绪高涨的情况下，绍兴县还展开了生产能否跃进再跃进的辩论。经过全县大辩论，一致认为早稻既然已经打下了良好的基础，就完全有可能乘胜直追，使株株出穗，穗穗结谷累累，谷粒颗颗饱满。因此，目前绝不是“保产”的问题，而是“大大超规划增产”的问题。接着，绍兴县向全省发起了“超规划增产”的挑战，掀起了浙江全省最近十天来汹涌澎湃的大破早稻四关、超规划大增产的群众运动。
    超规划大增产运动展开以后，全省早稻田间管理情况更加令人欢欣鼓舞。在消灭病虫害方面，已做到大多数专区和县都有治虫指挥部，乡、社成立了治虫大队、中队、突击组。嘉兴专区还和江苏省的苏州专区联合发动了好几万人多次联合围剿螟虫。治虫药剂也充分发掘使用了土方土法。仅据吴兴县一地召集“走方郎中”和化学技师座谈的结果，就发现有二十三种土药野草可以杀虫。全省各地千方百计地大搞速效肥料。如余杭、丽水、乐清等县，都已经做到了每社或者每一个队都有土制化肥厂。每一丘田都有万斤坑和堆肥池，户户都搞熏土灶。由于大施速效肥料，全省三类田迅速改观。现在全省的三类田已经从15％降低到5％以下。经过早耘、多耘、勤灌、浅灌、追施速效钾肥等一系列的工作，倒伏危险也大大减低。
    浙江省这次一反“保产”的口号而出现大大超规划增产的局面，是总路线的精神和北方几省小麦大丰收的事实，解放了人们的思想，鼓舞了人们的干劲的结果。最近，各地大大修改了原规划。过去原来订早稻每亩产量四百斤的，现在改为八百斤；原规划五百、六百斤的，现在订为一千斤。全省大部分县也不再以八百斤县、一千斤县作为今年的奋斗目标，而提出了争取成为一千五百斤县、双千斤县的口号。
