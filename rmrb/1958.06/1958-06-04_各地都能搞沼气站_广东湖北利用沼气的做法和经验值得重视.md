Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The biogas inspection team organized by the Ministry of Agriculture recently returned to Beijing and reported to the leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture on the results of the inspection of biogas work in Guangdong and Hubei provinces. The leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture gave a high evaluation of the achievements of the two places in utilizing biogas after listening to the report.
	The biogas inspection team inspected the biogas work in the Foshan Special District of Guangdong and believed that the biogas in this special district mainly solves rural lighting, cooking, and fertilizer accumulation, supplemented by the construction of some medium-sized and large-sized ones to solve power problems. The construction of small-sized ones requires less investment, generally only a few yuan, so there is no need for the state to spend money, and biogas stations can be built quickly, well, and economically. Thirteen counties in this special district are actively promoting biogas, among which Heshan County has started to build 848 thatch pool biogas digesters mainly for lighting and cooking, and 270 of them can already be used for lighting.
	The biogas station built in Xinhui County also focuses on lighting and cooking. In order to save metal, it has now achieved that all metal except the nozzle is not used. The lamp holder is made of plaster, the lamp gauze is made of mosquito net cloth coated with toothpaste, and the air outlet pipe is made of bamboo. Each plaster lamp costs only about two jiao. Now the plaster lamp and lamp gauze still have certain shortcomings and need to be further improved.
	The biogas inspection team reported that Hubei Province's approach is to mainly solve the power for rural power generation and agricultural processing, supplemented by solving lighting. They believe that it is better to build biogas digesters with an agricultural cooperative as a unit, which is easy to master technically and has greater economic benefits. For example, the construction cost of a 100-cubic-meter digester is only 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the investment can be solved from the agricultural cooperative's public accumulation fund. The biogas generated by such a biogas station drives an eight-horsepower internal combustion engine, working twelve hours a day (eight hours for processing and four hours for lighting), and the entire investment can be recovered in about one year. Wuhan compresses the generated biogas into bottles and uses it as transportation power. According to preliminary tests, about four to six cubic meters of biogas can be compressed into a forty-liter steel cylinder, which can supply a jeep to drive for forty minutes. Now Hubei Province has selected Macheng, Hongan, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and Xiangyang as key areas for biogas experiments, and all localities have taken action.
	Should the construction of large-scale biogas stations focus on solving power problems, or should the construction of small-scale ones focus on solving lighting and cooking problems? The biogas inspection team believes that it is better to build small-scale ones. Small-scale ones have low cost, can be built locally, and are easy to learn and promote. The construction of large-scale biogas digesters for power requires more investment and requires machinery and equipment and steel and cement materials, which are currently difficult to supply in large quantities in the market, so it is not suitable for large-scale promotion. However, in areas where power is urgently needed and there are economic conditions and resources, construction can be considered.
	After listening to the above report, the leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture believed that the use of biogas in these two places was basically successful; Guangdong Foshan Special District mainly builds small-scale biogas stations to solve lighting and cooking problems, supplemented by the construction of some medium-sized and large-sized ones to solve power problems, which is the right direction. The ability of these two places to start from the requirements of the broad masses and use biogas to solve the energy problem in rural areas is a great thing. It has found another important energy source for the realization of electrification in the vast rural areas and broken the mysterious view of electrification. Biogas is also something that all rural areas can do. The leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture put forward their opinions on how to carry out biogas work in the future, saying that biogas work should now be vigorously promoted throughout the country, with simultaneous experimentation and promotion, multi-point demonstrations, popularization first and then improvement, so as to achieve rapid and comprehensive flowering. The guiding principle for the construction of biogas stations should be small-scale as the main, medium-sized as the auxiliary, and a combination of large, medium, and small-sized, that is, first solve the problems of lighting and cooking, and then solve the problem of power. In the future, national biogas training classes should be opened to train technical forces; national biogas on-site meetings should be held to summarize experiences and exchange experiences.

### 各地都能搞沼气站  广东湖北利用沼气的做法和经验值得重视

　　各地都能搞沼气站
    广东湖北利用沼气的做法和经验值得重视
    据新华社3日讯  农业部组织的沼气考察组最近回到北京，向农业部领导上汇报了考察广东、湖北两省沼气工作的结果。农业部领导同志听了汇报后，对两地利用沼气的成就给了很高的评价。
    沼气考察组在广东考察了佛山专区的沼气工作，认为这个专区的沼气是以解决农村的点灯照明、煮饭、积肥为主，辅以建设一些中型和大型的来解决动力问题。建设小型的投资较少，一般只用几元，这样不要国家出钱，会多快好省地把沼气站建设起来。这个专区已有十三个县正在积极推广沼气，其中鹤山县开始以点灯照明、煮饭为主建立了茅池缸式的沼气发酵池八百四十八个，已有二百七十个能点灯照明。
    新会县建设的沼气站，也以点灯煮饭为主，为了节约金属，现已做到除喷气嘴外，全部不用金属。灯头是用石膏做的，灯纱是用蚊帐布涂牙膏做的，出气管是用竹子做的，石膏灯每只仅二角左右。现在石膏灯和灯纱还有一定的缺点，需要进一步改进。
    沼气考察组汇报说：湖北省的做法，是以解决农村发电、农业加工的动力为主，辅以解决点灯照明。他们认为沼气池的建设以一个农业社为单位较好，在技术上容易掌握，经济收益也较大。例如建设一百立方公尺容积的发酵池，建设费只要四千到五千元，投资可以从农业社的公积金中解决。这样的沼气站发出的沼气，带动八马力的内燃机，每天工作十二小时（八个小时加工，四个小时照明），全部投资一年左右就可收回。武汉市把发出的沼气压缩装瓶后作运输动力，据初步试验，大约可将四到六立方公尺的沼气压进四十公升容积的钢瓶中，能供吉普车行驶四十分钟。现在湖北省已选择麻城、红安、孝感、荆州、襄阳五个地区作为沼气试验重点，各地都已行动起来。
    沼气站建设大型的，以解决动力为主？还是建设小型的，以解决点灯煮饭为主？沼气考察组认为建设小型的为好，小型的造价低，能就地取材兴建，也易于学习，便于推广。建设动力用的大型沼气池，投资多，要有机器设备和钢筋水泥材料，目前市场大量供应有困难，因此不宜大量推广。但是，在迫切需要动力，又有经济条件和资源的地区，可以考虑兴建。
    农业部的领导同志在听取了以上的汇报后，认为这两地用沼气基本上都是成功的；广东佛山专区建设小型沼气站为主，解决点灯、煮饭，辅以建设一些中型和大型的解决动力问题，方向是对头的。这两地能从广大群众的要求出发，利用沼气解决农村的能源，是一件了不起的大事，它为广大农村实现电气化找到了又一个重要的能源，打破了电气化的神秘观点。沼气又是所有农村都能办到的事情。农业部领导同志对今后沼气工作如何开展，提出意见说，现在要在全国各地大力推广沼气工作，要边试验边推广，多点示范，先普及后提高，以便迅速全面开花。沼气站建设的方针应以小型为主，中型为辅，大中小相结合，即首先解决点灯、煮饭，后解决动力问题。今后要开办全国沼气训练班，培养技术力量；召开全国沼气现场会议，总结经验，交流经验。
