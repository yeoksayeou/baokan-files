    A Qing Dynasty Doctor Who Treated Appendicitis with Cutting Method
    Zhang Chaokui was a surgeon in the Qing Dynasty. He learned medicine from others around the age of twenty and understood a lot of surgical knowledge. Once, a man surnamed Liu "suffered from abdominal pain and was dying on the ground." He went to diagnose the illness and determined that the disease was in the large and small intestines. So he cut open the patient's abdomen by about two inches and inserted his fingers into the abdomen to treat it. A few days later, the patient recovered. This is what people now call acute appendicitis. The earliest European record of surgical treatment for such cases was in 1887 (19th century). However, an ordinary person in China, "from a humble background," was already able to perform this type of surgery in the mid-18th century (during the Qianlong reign). Unfortunately, Zhang Chaokui's treatment method was not passed down but was strangled by the feudal system of the time.

    清代用切割法治阑尾炎的医生
    张朝魁是我国清代的一位外科医生。他在二十岁左右时跟人学医，懂了许多外科方面的知识。一次，一个姓刘的人“患腹痛，卧地濒死”，他去诊病，判断病在大小肠。于是他把病人腹部剖开二寸许，用手指伸入腹内治理。几天以后，病人就好了。这就是现在人们说的急性阑尾炎。对这样的病例的开刀治疗，欧洲比较早的记录是在1887年（十九世纪）。而我国一位“出身低微”的普通人在十八世纪中叶（乾隆中）已经能做这种手术了。可惜张朝魁的治疗方法并没有流传下来，而被当时的封建制度扼杀了。
