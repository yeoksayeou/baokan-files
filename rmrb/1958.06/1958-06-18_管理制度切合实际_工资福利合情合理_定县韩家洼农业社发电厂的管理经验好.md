The Good Management Experience of the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative Power Plant in Ding County

(Reported from Ding County on the 17th by our newspaper) How should small factories run by agricultural cooperatives be managed? The experience of the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative Power Plant in Ding County in formulating management systems and running welfare programs is worth promoting.

Most of the workers in factories run by agricultural cooperatives are cooperative members who are not familiar with industrial production, and their technical and cultural levels are relatively low. Therefore, the formulation of various management systems must progress from simple to complex and be improved through learning. This cooperative's small power plant was built and put into production in mid-April. Among the only eleven employees in the plant, only one had worked as a mechanic for a few years, and the rest were farmers who had only attended elementary school for a few years and had never even seen a generator. Initially, the plant's leadership compiled a set of technical management regulations for electrical equipment, but it didn't work. After research by the workers, based on current needs, only three systems were established: safe operation, shift handover, and power outage communication. Two meeting systems were also established: after-shift inspection and accident analysis. Workers quickly learned to operate according to the systems. It was also stipulated that each worker should master two or three operating techniques. For example, line repairman Zhang Xinwu had never seen a transformer or motor before, but he is now a relatively skilled line worker. Since the plant was put into production, there has not been a single accident due to negligence, and oil consumption has gradually decreased.

The relationship between factories run by agricultural cooperatives and agricultural production is very close. Therefore, the wage system for workers in cooperative-run factories must not only reflect the complexity and high efficiency of industrial production technology but also take into account the actual income and living standards of agricultural cooperative members. Based on this principle, the wage system for workers in this cooperative's power plant adopts various forms such as hourly work, democratic work evaluation, seasonal comparison, and year-end bonus distribution (the bonus distribution method is the same as that of agricultural cooperative members). Their specific method is: to formulate the standard work points for each workday based on the technical and physical strength required for each type of work. There are a total of four levels, and then work evaluation is carried out based on the worker's technical proficiency and physical strength. The standard work points for each workday are one to one and a half work points higher than those of agricultural cooperative members with the same work capacity. In addition, at the end of each quarter, comparisons and rewards are also carried out based on the workers' achievements in learning technology and their work attitude, which encourages workers to actively learn and study technology. The agricultural cooperative members are also satisfied with this method.

The cooperative also uses the principle of "doing more with less money or no money" to mobilize industrial and agricultural cooperative members to jointly run welfare programs. For example, the problem of medical treatment for workers and agricultural cooperative members in the cooperative is solved in this way. They organized three doctors (cooperative members) together and established a clinic. The salaries of the three doctors and one pharmacist, as well as the purchase of medical equipment, are paid from 20% of the profits from medicines and diagnosis fees. In this way, the cooperative only built three adobe houses and the clinic was built. The cooperative is responsible for medical and medicine expenses for workers and agricultural cooperative members who are injured on duty; individuals and family members pay for their own medical treatment. Regarding the workers' bathing problem, the cooperative is preparing to build a bathing pool using the waste hot water discharged from the power plant. According to preliminary estimates, each of the more than 2,200 young and middle-aged people (including factory workers) in the cooperative can contribute 15 cents to build a simple bathing pool that can accommodate nearly 100 people at the same time, which not only solves the workers' bathing problem but also solves the bathing problem for all members of the cooperative.

The workers of the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative Power Plant often say: "The power plant is the lifeline of agriculture, and agricultural production is the rice bowl of the entire cooperative." Therefore, they not only love the factory as their home but also regard participating in agricultural production as their duty.

### 管理制度切合实际　工资福利合情合理  定县韩家洼农业社发电厂的管理经验好

    管理制度切合实际　工资福利合情合理
    定县韩家洼农业社发电厂的管理经验好
    本报定县17日电　农业社办的小型工厂怎样进行管理？定县韩家洼农业社发电厂制定管理制度和举办福利事业的经验，值得推广。
    农业社营工厂的工人，大部分都是社员，对工业生产不熟悉，技术、文化水平比较低，因而制订各种管理制度必须由简到繁、边学边健全。这个社的小型发电厂是在4月中旬建成投入生产的。全厂仅有的十一名职工中，只有一人当过几年机电工人，其余的都是只上过几年小学的农民，连发电机都没有见过。起初，这个厂的领导上编订了一套电气设备技术管理规程，结果行不通。经过工人研究，根据当前的需要，只建立了安全操作、交接班、停发电联系三项制度，还建立起班后检查和事故分析两种会议制度，工人很快就能按制度进行操作。并且规定每个工人要掌握二、三种操作技术。例如线路维修工张辛武，过去连变压器、电动机都没有见过，现已成了比较熟练的线路工人。这个厂自投入生产以来，没有发生过一次责任事故，油耗也逐渐降低。
    农业社办工厂和农业生产的关系很密切，因而社营工厂工人的工资制度，既要体现出工业生产技术比较复杂、效率高等特点，又得照顾到农业社员的实际收入和生活水平。根据这个原则，这个社发电厂工人的工资制度，采用了以时计工、民主评工、季节评比、年终分红（分红办法与农业社员一样）分红制工资等形式。他们的具体办法是：根据各工种所需要的技术、体力强度制订出每个劳动日的标准工分。共分为四级，然后再根据工人的技术熟练程度、体力强弱评工，每个劳动日的标准工分比同工力的农业社员高一工分到一点五工分。另外每季度末，还根据工人学习技术的成绩、劳动态度进行评比、奖励，鼓舞了工人积极学习钻研技术的热情。实行这种办法，农业社员也满意。
    这个社还以“不花钱或少花钱，多办事”的原则，发动工业、农业社员联合举办福利事业。比如社里的工人、农业社员的疾病治疗问题就是采用这种办法解决的。他们把三名医生（社员）组织在一起，成立了一个诊疗所，三名医生，一名司药的工资和购买医疗器械，从药品20％的利润和诊断费中开支。就这样，社里只盖了三间土坯房，就把诊疗所造起来了。工人、农业社员因公负伤，医疗、药费由社负责；个人和家属看病自己拿钱。工人的洗澡问题，社里正在筹备用电厂排出来的废热水修建一座洗澡池。据初步估计，全社二千二百多名青壮年（包括工厂工人），每人拿一角五分钱就能修建一座供近百人同时洗澡的简易洗澡池，不仅解决了工人的洗澡问题，而且解决了全社人员的洗澡问题。
    韩家洼农业社发电厂工人常说：“电厂是农业的命根子，农业生产是全社的饭碗子。”因而，他们不仅爱厂如家，而且把参加农业生产看作是自己的本分。
