    Develop Bamboo More and Faster
    Chen Yu
    The rainy season is the best time to cultivate bamboo. It is a good thing that Huaning County in Yunnan Province can seize this season to develop bamboo.
    Bamboo is a widely used item in our daily life. In areas where bamboo is abundant, almost all of people's utensils are made of bamboo. For example, bamboo chopsticks and bamboo bowls for eating, bamboo hats and umbrellas for rain protection, bamboo beds and bamboo mats for sleeping, and so on. The "Guwen Guanzhi" once compiled "Huanggang Bamboo House Record," and the article begins like this: "The land of Huanggang is rich in bamboo, the large ones are like rafters. Bamboo craftsmen break it, hollow out its joints, and use it to replace pottery tiles. This is the case in every household, because it is cheap and saves labor." This shows that using bamboo to build houses is very common in bamboo-producing areas. Handicraftsmen in Hunan, Sichuan and other places use bamboo to make various baskets that are very exquisite and popular among the masses. In recent years, people have made further applications of bamboo. In areas such as water conservancy construction, urban construction, and industrial production, bamboo materials have been used in many places, which is of great benefit to saving wood and steel.
    Developing bamboo and using bamboo to green barren mountains is also a good way to maintain soil and water and beautify the living environment. Bamboo is a relatively cold-resistant evergreen plant. The ancients called pine, bamboo, and plum the "Three Friends of Winter." When severe winter comes and the leaves wither, bamboo still stands tall and graceful; when the summer is hot and the sun is scorching, bamboo often gives people a cool and tranquil impression.
    The biggest characteristic of bamboo is its fast growth. We know that it takes more than ten or even dozens of years for a relatively good tree to grow from planting to becoming timber, while newly planted bamboo can be used in only two or three years. In the case of wood shortage, if we can develop bamboo more and faster, we can correspondingly alleviate the tension in the supply of wood. At present, the bamboo production situation in our country is far from meeting the needs of the people. Many places with conditions for growing bamboo have not vigorously cultivated bamboo. Bamboo can also grow north of the Yellow River Basin, but in this vast area, only individual parks plant bamboo for people to appreciate, while a large amount of bamboo materials and bamboo utensils are transported from the distant south, which is not worthwhile.

    更多更快地发展竹子
    陈宇
    雨季正是培植竹子的最好季节。云南华宁县能够抓紧这个季节发展竹子，是一件好事情。
    竹子是我们日常生活中应用很广泛的东西。在盛产竹子的地区，人们的一切用具几乎全部用竹子做成。例如，吃饭的竹筷、竹碗，遮雨的竹笠、雨伞，睡眠用的竹床、竹席，等等。“古文观止”上曾辑有“黄冈竹楼记”，文章一开头就这样写道：“黄冈之地多竹，大者如椽，竹工破之，刳去其节，用代陶瓦，比屋皆然，以其价廉而工省也。”这说明用竹子建筑房子在产竹地区是很普遍的。湖南、四川等地手工艺人利用竹子做成各种篮子非常精致，深受群众欢迎。近几年来，人们对竹子做了进一步的应用，诸如水利建设、城市建设、工业生产等方面，很多地方都利用了竹材，这对节约木材和钢材有很大的好处。
    发展竹子、用竹子绿化荒山，对于保持水土，美化居住环境也是很好的办法。竹子是一种比较耐寒的常绿植物，古人称松竹梅为“岁寒三友”。当严冬降临，树叶雕落的时候，竹子仍是亭亭玉立；当盛夏溽暑，烈日困人的时候，竹子常常给人一种清凉恬静的印象。
    竹子最大的特点是生长快，我们知道一株比较好的树木由栽种到成材需要十几年到几十年的时间，而新栽的竹子，只两三年即可应用。在木材缺乏的情况下，如果我们能更多更快地使竹子发展起来，就能相应地缓和木材供应的紧张。目前，我们国家的竹子生产状况还远远不能满足人民的需要，许多有条件生长竹子的地方，还没有大力培植竹子。在黄河流域以北本来也是可以生长竹子的，可是，在这广大地区内，只有个别公园才种竹供人欣赏，而大量的竹材竹器却从遥远的南方运来，这是不值得的。
