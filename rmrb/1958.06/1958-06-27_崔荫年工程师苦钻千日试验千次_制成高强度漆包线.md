Engineer Cui Yinnian Works Diligently for a Thousand Days and Experiments a Thousand Times
    To Produce High-Strength Enamelled Wire

    (Our report) An artificial polymer compound - polyvinyl formal and high-strength enamelled wire made with polyvinyl formal, have been successfully manufactured by engineer Cui Yinnian of Tianjin Daxi Enamelled Wire Factory. At the same time, China's first polyvinyl formal workshop, built for the production of high-strength enamelled wire, was also completed at the end of May and is now undergoing trial production.

    Polyvinyl formal is made from calcium carbide gas and acetic acid through dozens of chemical procedures. It is one of the latest international scientific and technological achievements, and currently only a very few countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain are capable of manufacturing it. Polyvinyl formal is an insulating material for making enamelled wire; and enamelled wire is one of the important materials for making motors, transformers, radios, and various electrical instruments. The quality of enamelled wire directly affects the quality and performance of electrical machinery and instruments. In the past, the enamelled wire used in China's motor industry was made of tung oil and resin. Because of its low strength and short service life, it not only affected the quality of general motor products, but also could not be used to manufacture high-performance products used in aviation, power, and telecommunications.

    The production and widespread use of high-strength enamelled wire will cause a technological revolution in the motor and instrument manufacturing industry, the structure of motor products will become smaller and lighter; the process will become high-speed; raw materials will be saved; and it will provide the possibility for manufacturing high-performance and precise motor products needed in aviation, power, telecommunications and other fields. Because high-strength enamelled wire has good heat resistance and aging resistance, the life of the motor can also be greatly extended.

    Polyvinyl alcohol, an intermediate product of polyvinyl formal, can be processed to manufacture various synthetic fibers. A single fiber spun from one gram of polyvinyl alcohol can be hundreds of meters long. This single fiber can be made into artificial cotton and artificial wool after further processing. Polyvinyl alcohol also has strong wear resistance and corrosion resistance, and can be used to manufacture insulation layers for submarine cables that are not afraid of seawater erosion; it can also be used as a material for automobile brake braking devices and oil-resistant parts, opening up new avenues for the supply of raw materials for the motor industry, textile industry, and other industrial sectors.

    Polymer chemistry is one of the latest international scientific achievements. Its theory, structure, and reaction principles are very complex. Engineer Cui Yinnian, without technical data or special equipment, studied the theory of polymer chemistry while conducting experiments, worked hard, and spent three years doing thousands of experiments, finally mastering the complete technology for manufacturing this artificial polymer. Now, the quality of the high-strength enamelled wire produced by this factory has caught up with the level of the United Kingdom.

    The newly built China's first polyvinyl formal workshop was jointly designed by engineer Cui Yinnian and the factory's technicians and veteran workers, and all the equipment was also manufactured in China.

    崔荫年工程师苦钻千日试验千次
    制成高强度漆包线
    本报讯　一种人造高分子化合物——聚乙烯醇缩醛和用聚乙烯醇缩醛做成的高强度漆包线，已由天津大新漆包线厂工程师崔荫年制造成功。同时，为生产高强度漆包线而建设的我国第一座聚乙烯醇缩醛车间，也已经在5月底竣工，现在正进行试生产。
    聚乙烯醇缩醛是以电石气和醋酸为原料，经过数十道化学手续制成的。它是国际最新科学技术成就之一，目前能够制造的只有苏联、美、英等极少的几个国家。聚乙烯醇缩醛是制造漆包线的绝缘材料；而漆包线又是制造电动机、变压器、无线电以及各种电器仪表的重要材料之一。漆包线的好坏，直接影响着电机仪表的质量和性能。过去，我国电机工业使用的漆包线是用桐油和树脂制成的，由于强度低，使用年限短，不仅影响一般电机产品的质量，而且不能用来制造航空、电力、电讯等方面使用的高性能产品。
    高强度漆包线的制成和广泛使用，将引起电机仪表制造工业的技术革命，电机产品的结构将走向小型化、轻量化；工艺过程变为高速化；节约原材料；为制造航空、电力、电讯等方面需要的高性能、精密的电机产品提供了可能性。由于高强度漆包线的耐热、耐老化性能好，电动机的寿命也可以大大延长。
    聚乙烯醇缩醛的中间产品——聚乙烯醇，经过加工可以制造各种合成纤维。用一公分重的聚乙烯醇纺出的单纤维有数百公尺长。这种单纤维在进一步加工后，就可以制成人造棉和人造毛。聚乙烯醇还具有较强的耐磨、耐腐蚀的性能，可以用它制造不怕海水浸蚀的海底电缆的绝缘层；也可以做汽车刹车制动装置和耐油另件的材料，为电机工业、纺织工业等若干工业部门的原材料供应开辟了新的途径。
    高分子化学是国际最新的科学成就之一。它的理论、结构和反应原理都很复杂。崔荫年工程师在没有技术资料和特殊设备的条件下，一面研究高分子化学的理论，一面进行试验，刻苦钻研，前后用了三年的时间，做了上千次的试验，终于掌握了制造这种人造高分子的全套技术。现在，这个厂制出的高强度漆包线的质量已经赶上英国的水平。
    新建的我国第一座聚乙烯醇缩醛车间，是崔荫年工程师和厂内技术人员、老工人共同研究设计的，全部设备也是我国自己制造的。
