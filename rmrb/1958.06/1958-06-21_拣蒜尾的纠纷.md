Having returned home from work, I saw my younger sister Yaqin pouting, and my mother also looking displeased. One faced outwards, the other turned to the wall. The second child was crying in bed, his face covered in tears, but no one was paying attention to him. Looking at the ground, it was scattered with "garlic scapes" - the tail end of the garlic shoots. It was clear that my sister was arguing with my mother. When I asked Yaqin, she said, "It's nothing!" Then I turned to ask my mother, and the old woman also brushed it off, saying, "It's all my fault, always making a fuss!" After working all day, I couldn't even come home and have a peaceful meal. I angrily picked up the second child and went outside.

Turning to Uncle Wang's house next door, they were having dinner. Aunt Wang probably knew that my family was having a tiff, and insisted that I sit down and eat a little. As soon as I sat down, Aunt Wang said with a smile, "Hey, Baoniu, you know, the reason for your family's anger today is all Yaqin's fault!" I said, "What's it all about?" Aunt Wang quickly leaned closer to me and said, "Actually, it's just a trivial matter!" She tilted her head and looked at the front yard and said, "It's like this. This morning, Sister Wang from the front yard, the engineer Zhang's wife, took a large bunch of garlic scapes and quietly ran to your kitchen and said to your mother: 'Sister, this is the garlic shoot we bought, the garlic tails are green, but Mrs. Zhang insists they don't taste good and told me to throw them away. I couldn't bear to throw them away, so I brought them to you without saying a word, but don't think I'm being presumptuous!' After saying that, she turned around and left. Your mother washed them and washed them again, and even said: 'This is the first time we've eaten fresh things this year!' It wouldn't have been anything, it's a pity to throw away good things! Who knew that your sister Yaqin would repeatedly argue with your mother, saying: 'You have no backbone, stooping so low to eat other people's discarded things!' insisting on throwing them out. Your mother couldn't bear it, and the mother and daughter struggled for a long time. Your sister, she's too stubborn, and she slammed the garlic scapes on the ground. That's why the mother and daughter fell out."

After Aunt Wang finished speaking, she sighed deeply: "Alas, child! You are all born and raised in fortunate times, unlike your mother who has experienced hardship. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Henan suffered a famine, and the poor ate all the tree bark and grass roots, even the river weeds were weighed on the scales. If we had a bunch of these garlic scapes back then, it would have been like heaven! Didn't your brother Fuwa starve to death then! He was only six years old when he died!" "Eat your饭吧!" Uncle Wang, who hadn't spoken all along, probably didn't want to bring up that sad event again, and said impatiently to his old partner, "What's the use of always mentioning those old, ancient things!"

Back at home, I carefully picked up the garlic scapes scattered on the ground, one by one.

    拣蒜尾的纠纷
    严岩
    放工回到家里，看见妹妹亚琴噘着嘴，妈妈也满脸不高兴。一个脸朝外，一个脸扭到墙上。二小子在床上哭得泪人一样，也没人理睬。再看看地上撒了一地“蒜尾”——蒜苔后面的尾巴。准是妹妹在和妈妈呕气了。问亚琴她却说：“啥也不为！”又转过问妈妈，老人家也搪塞着说：“都怨我不好，老作贱！”上了一天班，回家来还不能顺顺当当吃顿饭，我赌气抱起二小子出去了。
    转到隔壁王师傅家里，人家正在吃饭。王师母大概知道我家闹气啦，死拉活缠的硬叫坐下吃一点。我刚一坐下，王师母就笑着说：“咳；保牛，你说呀，今个你们家生气可是亚琴的不是啦！”我说：“究竟为啥呀？”王师母连忙往我跟前凑凑说：“其实呀，才是鸡毛蒜皮哩！”她又歪头看看前院说：“是这么回事。今个上午前院张工程师家的王嫂，拿了一大把蒜尾，悄悄跑到你家厨房对你妈说：‘大嫂子，这是俺家买的蒜苔，蒜尾青青的，张太太硬说不好吃，叫扔了。我舍不得扔了，没言声给你拿来，可别嫌弃啊’！说了转屁股就走了。你妈呢，就洗了又洗，还说：‘今年是第一次吃鲜物哩！’论说这也没啥，好好的东西么扔了怪可惜！谁知你妹妹亚琴就一连声吵你妈：‘没出息，低三下四吃人家扔掉的东西’一定要扔出去，你妈舍不得，娘俩夺了半天。你妹子呀，性子太倔，一下把蒜尾摔了一地。就为这事娘俩才闹翻了。”
    王师母说完，长叹了一口气：“唉，娃子呀！你们才都是福里生福里长的，不像你妈那样从难处过过。民国十八年河南遭年景，穷人把树皮、草根都吃光啦，河里水草都上秤盘。那时候要有这一把蒜尾就好到天上啦！你福娃哥还不是那时眼睁睁给饿死啦！死时才六岁呀！”“吃你的饭吧！”一直没有说话的王师傅，大概是不想再提起那伤心事，这时不耐烦地对他老伴说：“老是提那些陈年古代的事有啥用！”
    回到家，我仔细地把撒在地上的蒜尾，一棵棵的拣了起来。
