Why?

    Soda Can Quench Thirst
    Drinking soda feels cool and quenches thirst because soda contains not only cold boiled water, sugar, fruit juice, etc., but also a large amount of dissolved carbon dioxide. When drinking soda, the carbon dioxide in the soda evaporates in large quantities, absorbing heat energy from the human body, so it not only quenches thirst but also has a cooling sensation. At the same time, carbon dioxide can also promote the secretion of gastric juice and intestinal juice, which can help digestion.
    Carbon dioxide is not soluble in water under normal atmospheric pressure; it can only be dissolved in soda under increased pressure. However, when the bottle cap is opened, the carbon dioxide evaporates rapidly and turns into foam due to the decrease in pressure. Therefore, we should drink soda quickly, so as not to lose its cooling effect due to the escape of carbon dioxide.

专栏：为什么？

    汽水能解渴
    喝汽水感到清凉解渴，这是因为汽水里面除了有冷开水、糖、果汁等外，还有大量的溶解了的二氧化碳。喝汽水时，由于汽水中的二氧化碳大量蒸发，吸收了人体内的热能，所以不但解渴，而且有清凉之感。同时，二氧化碳还能促进胃液和肠液的分泌，能帮助消化。
    二氧化碳在普通大气压力下，是不溶解于水的，只有加大压力才能使它溶于汽水之中。但是当打开瓶盖时，由于压力减低，二氧化碳便迅速蒸发而变成泡沫。因此我们在饮汽水时应该快一点喝，以免二氧化碳逸散而失去清凉作用。
