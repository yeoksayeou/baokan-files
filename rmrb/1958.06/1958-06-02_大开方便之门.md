Open the Doors of Convenience Wide

Recently, postal and telecommunications work has been full of vigor. Following the advanced newspaper and magazine distribution workers' gathering in Beijing, which issued a competition proposal of "Everything for the convenience of readers," receiving widespread response from newspaper and magazine distribution workers across the country, the Dongsi Post Office in Beijing, with its advanced deeds of boldly breaking conventions and providing more convenience to readers, has attracted postal and telecommunications workers nationwide to emulate it. In the postal and telecommunications sector, many grassroots enterprises have also created noteworthy experiences in how to strengthen political work, improve enterprise management, and organize technological innovations. The recent four-level cadre meeting of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications further focused on criticizing the passive sentiment of "Jiang Taigong fishing" and right-leaning conservative thinking, greatly encouraging the revolutionary drive of postal and telecommunications workers. A vigorous upsurge in postal and telecommunications work has begun to take shape.

Over the past eight years, China's postal and telecommunications work has achieved tremendous results. According to recent statistics, the total length of postal routes and long-distance telecommunications lines nationwide has more than doubled compared to old China. 98.4% of townships are accessible by postal routes, and 75% of townships are accessible by telephone. The number of postal and telecommunications organizations has increased fivefold compared to the total number built in the seventy-plus years before liberation. The capacity of urban telephones has also exceeded the total construction of old China in fifty years. The circulation of each issue of newspapers and magazines is over 30 million copies. All of these are unprecedented in history. However, postal and telecommunications work also has some serious shortcomings. It should be emphasized that in a considerable period after 1953, especially after being wrongly influenced by "anti-rash advance" in the second half of 1956, the postal and telecommunications departments seriously suffered from the passive business ideology of "Jiang Taigong fishing." Under the control of this passive business ideology, the "bureaucratic style" left over from the postal and telecommunications departments of old China has not been fundamentally transformed, and "waiting for customers to come" rules and regulations are everywhere, which seriously hinders postal and telecommunications work from better serving the country and the people.

The postal and telecommunications departments are service departments facing the broad masses. The great leap forward in postal and telecommunications work is ultimately about how to better serve the country and the people. How can postal and telecommunications work make a great leap forward, and how can it better serve the country and the people? According to the experience of advanced units such as the Dongsi Post Office in Beijing, and according to the understanding of the four-level cadre meeting of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the most important thing is to thoroughly criticize the business ideology of "Jiang Taigong fishing" and break the series of outdated rules and regulations under the control of this business ideology, changing from "waiting for customers to come" to "opening the doors of convenience wide."

The business ideology of "Jiang Taigong fishing" comes from a seemingly correct but actually incorrect understanding of postal and telecommunications work, that is, the development of postal and telecommunications work is premised on social needs. No one can force anyone to send letters, and no one can force anyone to subscribe to newspapers. Therefore, postal and telecommunications work can only "wait for customers to come," and postal and telecommunications workers can only be "Jiang Taigong." This understanding is undoubtedly incorrect. The development of postal and telecommunications work is indeed premised on social needs, and forced distribution is always wrong, but this does not mean that postal and telecommunications work can only "wait for customers to come," and postal and telecommunications workers can only be "Jiang Taigong." The development of postal and telecommunications work is premised on social needs, which is not a unique characteristic of the postal and telecommunications departments, but a common feature of various social division of labor departments since the division of labor in society. Not to mention the postal and telecommunications, transportation, and commercial departments that do not produce material wealth, even the industrial, agricultural, and handicraft departments that produce material wealth, which department's production and work is not premised on social needs? The postal and telecommunications departments cannot force people to send letters. Can the industrial departments force people to use certain machines? If it is correct to say that the postal and telecommunications departments can only be "Jiang Taigong" because of this, then shouldn't all departments in society be "Jiang Taigong"? If everyone is "Jiang Taigong" and does not actively improve production and work, and only "waits for customers to come," how can society progress!

Production and needs are always complementary. Production is premised on needs, and production also affects needs. Before the automobile was invented, there could not be automobile buyers, as if society did not need automobiles; but after the automobile was produced, it immediately became popular, precisely what society needed. When things are expensive, few people buy them, as if the social demand is very small; when prices are lowered, business is booming, and social demand increases greatly. These are all the laws of development of things. Social needs promote the development of social production, and the development of social production in turn drives the improvement of social needs. Although the postal and telecommunications departments are not departments that produce material wealth, their relationship with social needs is exactly the same as that of departments that produce material wealth. Before the telegram was invented, people also lived, as if society did not need telegrams; but after the telegram was invented, it was widely promoted and became an indispensable communication tool. Before January 1st of this year, the price of telegrams was high, and there was a large surplus of telegram equipment, as if the social demand was very small; later, the telegram fee was reduced, and more people sent telegrams, and the social demand increased. It can be seen that although the development of postal and telecommunications work is premised on social needs, the increase and decrease of social needs are constantly influenced by the work of the postal and telecommunications departments themselves.

The business ideology of "Jiang Taigong fishing" only reflects the passive side of postal and telecommunications work being premised on social needs, and does not see the broad subjective initiative of postal and telecommunications work in the face of social needs. Therefore, this ideology is one-sided and wrong. It supports right-leaning conservative thinking, protects the backward phenomena of postal and telecommunications enterprises, and excludes the enthusiasm and creativity of postal and telecommunications workers in actively developing business. Without removing the stubborn stone of "Jiang Taigong fishing" from the road of advancement, postal and telecommunications work cannot make a great leap forward.

The great leap forward in postal and telecommunications work, changing from "waiting for customers to come" to "opening the doors of convenience wide," in addition to criticizing the business ideology of "Jiang Taigong fishing," also requires using the spirit of revolution to break the old rules and regulations. Rules and regulations are necessary means to establish and consolidate social order. The rules and regulations of the postal and telecommunications departments are important methods to ensure the rapid, accurate, and safe postal and telecommunications communication. It should be said that most of the existing rules and regulations of the postal and telecommunications departments have a positive effect, but a considerable part also hinders postal and telecommunications work from better serving the country and the people. For example, some rules and regulations only consider the convenience of internal work of the enterprise, but do not consider the convenience of the masses; some rules and regulations only consider "in case of emergency," but do not start from the convenience of the people, but increase the trouble for the masses, making people "angry at the sight." "Opening the doors of convenience wide" requires abolishing and revising these outdated rules and regulations, and establishing new rules and regulations that both ensure the safety of postal and telecommunications communication and facilitate the people.

"Opening the doors of convenience wide" not only needs to solve ideological problems and system problems, but also needs to solve technical problems. Postal and telecommunications work is completed by relying on communication equipment. Insufficient and poor equipment, such as too few lines, unreliable telephones, etc., no matter how good the service attitude is, it cannot ultimately make people feel convenient. This requires a technical revolution to completely change the technical conditions of postal and telecommunications enterprises. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, the postal and telecommunications departments need to have a long-term technical development plan, and adopt the world's most advanced technical equipment to transform China's postal and telecommunications enterprises; on the other hand, and perhaps the most important and urgent aspect, is to follow the mass line, mobilize the broad masses of postal and telecommunications workers to continue to deeply develop the technical innovation movement, learn technology, improve technology, improve equipment, improve tools, improve operating methods, improve the organization of communication networks, and correspondingly improve production organization and labor organization, in order to improve efficiency, eliminate and reduce errors, and better and more widely serve the country and the people.

With the continuous upsurge of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production and the cultural high tide, it is imperative for postal and telecommunications work to catch up. Throughout the country, from south to north, from east to west, where is not a battlefield for the leap forward? Which battle is not fighting for time? In these continuous battlefields and day and night battles, how many people are by the telephone? How many people are waiting for the arrival of the postman? The current postal and telecommunications work is like the communication soldiers in wartime, closely related to the development of the battle. "Where there is a telephone, there is a high tide," this is one of the experience talks of the CCP Xushui County Committee in Hebei Province in leading the agricultural great leap forward. This experience may seem like an exaggeration to postal and telecommunications work, but it actually reflects the close relationship between postal and telecommunications work and the work of various departments, and also reflects the urgent hope of the broad masses of people for improving and developing postal and telecommunications work. The staff of the postal and telecommunications departments should go all out, strive for the top, and strive to meet the needs of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, adapt to the technological revolution and cultural revolution that are taking shape, and better serve the country and the people!

### 大开方便之门

　　大开方便之门
    最近一个时期，邮电工作很有朝气。继先进报刊发行工作者在北京集会，发出“一切为了便利读者”的竞赛倡议，得到全国报刊发行工作者的广泛响应之后，北京市东四邮局又以大胆打破陈规，多方便利读者的先进事迹，吸引了全国邮电职工群起仿效。在邮电部门怎样加强政治工作、改进企业管理和组织技术革新，也已经有许多基层企业创造了值得注意的经验。不久以前召开的邮电部四级干部会议，更集中批判了“姜太公钓鱼”的消极情绪和右倾保守思想，大大鼓舞了邮电职工的革命干劲。一个蓬蓬勃勃的邮电工作大跃进的局面已经开始形成。
    八年来，我国邮电工作获得了巨大的成绩。据不久前的统计，全国邮路和长途电信线路总长度，已比旧中国增加了一倍以上，98.4％的乡都通达邮路，75％的乡都通达电话。邮电机构比解放前七十多年间建成的总数增加了五倍。市内电话的容量也超过了旧中国五十年建设的总和。每期报纸和杂志的发行量都在三千万份以上。这些都是历史上从来不曾有过的。然而，邮电工作也有比较严重的缺点。需要着重指出的是，在1953年以后一个相当长的时期里，特别是在1956年下半年受到“反冒进”的错误影响之后，邮电部门严重地存在“姜太公钓鱼”的消极业务思想。在这种消极的业务思想支配下，旧中国邮电部门遗留下来的“衙门作风”没有能得到根本改造，“等客上门”的规章制度比比皆是，这就严重妨碍了邮电工作更好地为国家和人民服务。
    邮电部门是面向广大群众的服务部门。邮电工作的大跃进，归根到底就是怎样更好地为国家和人民服务。邮电工作怎样大跃进，怎样更好地为国家和人民服务呢？根据北京市东四邮局等先进单位的经验，根据邮电部四级干部会议的认识，最主要的还是彻底批判“姜太公钓鱼”的业务思想，并且打破在这种业务思想支配下的一系列陈规陋矩，变“等客上门”为“大开方便之门”。
      “姜太公钓鱼”的业务思想来自一种对邮电工作的似是而非的认识，即邮电工作的发展以社会需要为前提，谁也不能强迫谁寄信，谁也不能强迫谁订报，因而邮电工作只能“等客上门”，邮电工作者只能做“姜太公”。这种认识无疑是不正确的。邮电工作的发展确实以社会需要为前提，强迫摊派永远是错误的，但这并不等于说邮电工作只能“等客上门”，邮电工作者只能做“姜太公”。邮电工作的发展以社会需要为前提，并不是邮电部门独有的个性，而是自有社会分工以来各个不同的社会分工部门普遍具有的共性。不要说是邮电、交通、商业等不生产物质财富的部门，就是拿工业、农业和手工业等生产物质财富的部门来说，哪一个部门的生产和工作不是以社会需要为前提的呢？邮电部门不能强迫人寄信，工业部门又何尝能强迫人采用某种机器呢？如果说邮电部门因此只能做“姜太公”是正确的，那么社会上的一切部门岂不是都应该做“姜太公”吗？人人都做“姜太公”，都不去积极地改进生产和工作，都“等客上门”，社会怎么能进步呢！
    生产和需要总是相辅相成的。生产以需要为前提，生产也影响需要。汽车没有发明以前，不可能有汽车买主，好像社会上并不需要汽车；但汽车生产出来之后，马上就风行一时，恰恰是社会所需要的。东西贵了，买的人少，像是社会需要量很小；价格降低了，生意兴隆，社会需要大增。这些，都是事物的发展规律。社会需要推动社会生产的发展，社会生产的发展又带动社会需要的提高。邮电部门虽然不是生产物质财富的部门，但它同社会需要的关系，却同生产物质财富的部门一无二样。电报没有发明以前，人们也活了下来，好像社会上并不需要电报；但电报发明之后却普遍推行开来，变成不可缺少的通信工具。今年1月1日以前，电报的价格高，电报设备大有富裕，好像社会需要量很小；后来降低电报费，打电报的多了，社会需要量就增加了。可见，邮电工作的发展虽然以社会需要为前提，但社会需要的增长和减少，也无时无刻不被邮电部门本身的工作所左右。
    “姜太公钓鱼”的业务思想，只反映了邮电工作以社会需要为前提的被动的一面，而没有看到邮电工作在社会需要的面前有广阔的主观能动性的一面，因而这种思想是片面的、错误的。它支持着右倾保守思想，保护着邮电企业的落后现象，排斥邮电工作者主动发展业务的积极性和创造性。不把“姜太公钓鱼”这块顽石从前进的道路上搬走，邮电工作是不可能大跃进的。
    邮电工作大跃进，变“等客上门”为“大开方便之门”，除了批判“姜太公钓鱼”的业务思想之外，还要用革命的精神来打破陈旧的规章制度。规章制度是建立和巩固社会秩序的必要手段。邮电部门的规章制度是保障邮电通信迅速、准确、安全的重要方法。应该说，邮电部门现行的规章制度大部分是有积极作用的，但也相当一部分是妨碍邮电工作更好地为国家和人民服务的。例如有些规章制度只考虑了企业内部工作的方便，而没有考虑到群众的方便；有些规章制度只考虑了“以防万一”，而没有从便利人民群众出发，反而给群众增加了麻烦，使人“望而生气”。“大开方便之门”就要废除和修改这些陈规陋矩，建立新的既保证邮电通信的安全、又便利人民群众的规章制度。
      “大开方便之门”不只要解决思想问题和制度问题，还要解决技术问题。邮电工作是依靠通信设备来完成的，设备不足和不良，例如线路太少、电话不灵等等，不管服务态度多么好，还是不能最终使人感到方便的。这就需要进行一个技术革命，来彻底改变邮电企业的技术状况。实现这个目标，一方面需要邮电部门有一个远大的技术发展的规划，采用世界上最先进的技术设备来改造我国的邮电企业；另一方面，也可以说是最重要最迫切的方面，是要走群众路线，发动广大邮电职工继续深入开展技术革新运动，学习技术，提高技术，改进设备，改进工具，改进操作方法，改进通信网路的组织，并且相应地改进生产组织和劳动组织，以便提高效率，消灭和减少差错，更好地、更广泛地为国家和人民服务。
    随着工农业生产高潮和文化高潮的不断高涨，邮电工作急起直追已属刻不容缓。全国各地，从南到北，从东到西，何处不是跃进的战场？哪一场战斗不是在争取时间？在这些连绵万里的战场上和夜以继日的战斗中，有多少人在电话机旁？有多少人等待着邮递员的到来？现在的邮电工作，真像战时的通信兵一样，同战斗的发展息息相关。“哪里有电话，哪里就有高潮”，这是中共河北省徐水县委会领导农业大跃进的经验谈之一。这个经验，好像是对邮电工作的过誉，实际上反映了邮电工作同各部门工作的密切关系，也反映了广大人民对改善和发展邮电工作的迫切希望。邮电部门的职工要鼓足干劲，力争上游，为适应工农业生产高潮的需要，适应正在形成的技术革命和文化革命的需要，更好地为国家和人民服务而奋斗！
