    Extracting Petroleum from Cottonseed Oil Sludge
    (By our newspaper) Xi'an Public-Private Joint New Life Oil Factory director Li Peiji and all the factory workers have extracted artificial petroleum from the sludge of cottonseed oil. The gasoline refined from this artificial petroleum has been tested in ordinary cars, and the combustion is normal, proving that the quality fully meets the standards. From cottonseed oil sludge, 37%-40% of crude oil can be extracted. From every 100 jin of this crude oil, 27% of artificial gasoline, 22% of kerosene, and 40% of light, medium, and heavy diesel oil can be refined. The remainder can be used as Vaseline and asphalt. The factory will further study the use of oil sludge from peanut oil, soybean oil, and other oils to extract artificial petroleum.

    从棉籽油泥中炼出石油
    本报讯　西安市公私合营新生油厂厂长李培基和全厂职工，从棉籽油的油泥中提炼出人造石油。用这种人造石油炼成的汽油，在普通汽车上作了行驶试验，燃烧情况正常，证明质量完全合乎标准。从棉籽油泥中可以提出原油37％—40％。这种原油每百斤可提炼出人造汽油27％，火油22％，轻、中、重柴油40％，剩下的还可作凡士林和沥青。这个厂还将进一步研究利用花生油、豆油等油泥来提炼人造石油。
