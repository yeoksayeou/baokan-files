Wonderful Fact

　　In the past, people only knew that elephants were not well-suited to long-distance travel, but they didn't know why. Recently, it was discovered that if an animal, such as a chicken, is placed in the elephant's cage, the elephant's behavior becomes much calmer. It turns out that elephants can't stand loneliness.

    奇妙的事实
    从前，人们只是知道大象对长途旅行是很不能适应的，然而不知道是什么原因。最近才发现，在象笼子里放进一个动物，譬如一只鸡，大象的举止就大为安静了。原来大象是耐不住寂寞的。　（赵连生）
