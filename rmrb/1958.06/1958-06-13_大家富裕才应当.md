    Everyone Being Rich is the Right Thing
    Look at Zhang Guzhen, a rich peasant with deep-seated ideas! Everyone works the night shift, but she doesn't worry at home. Every commune member is making a Great Leap Forward, but she doesn't care about your thirty-three.

    Selfish and self-interested thinking is bad, digging ponds on private plots. Just as fertilizer is about to be collected by the team, manure from the manure pond is loaded into the stable. Always thinking of petty advantages, disregarding collective interests. Everyone, take a look, is this the right thing to do? Today it's posted on the big-character poster, advising you to correct it quickly in the future.

    Strive for good work quality, actively work night shifts, achieve a leap forward in production, everyone being rich is the right thing.

### 大家富裕才应当

    大家富裕才应当
    看看张古珍，富裕农民思想深！人人干夜班，她在家里不紧张，个个社员大跃进，她哪管你三十三。
    自私自利思想坏，自留地上挖塘塘，肥料刚要收到队，粪塘粪往厩里装，随时随地想便宜，集体利益丢一旁。大家看一看，这样当不当？今天登上大字报，劝你以后快改掉。
    工作质量认真搞，积极出工干夜班，生产跃进实现了，大家富裕才应当。
