	Chinese Class in Bucharest
	Two years ago, the Department of Languages at Bucharest's Parhon University established a Chinese class, the only one in Romania. Currently, there are nine students in the class, some of whom abandoned majors they had already studied for one or two years in order to learn Chinese.

	For foreign friends, learning Chinese is truly not a simple matter. Each character is a mysterious "painting" in their eyes. The students in the Chinese class at Parhon University also encountered many difficulties when they started learning, the first being pronunciation. They always felt that their tongues couldn't turn properly, and they couldn't distinguish the four tones. For example, they often pronounced "mā" (麻) as "mǎ" (马). Even more difficult was writing characters. They said that learning to write each character required a "battle." But the Romanian students, with their boundless love for the Chinese people, tenaciously overcame these difficulties.

	Two years ago, students had to listen to lectures from Chinese teachers through translation, but now they can understand them without translation. Today, they have mastered more than two thousand characters. Last year, they established correspondence with students in the Romanian language class at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, and they also correspond with Chinese youth. They have now received more than a thousand letters from their Chinese friends.

    布加勒斯特的中文班
    两年前，布加勒斯特巴洪大学语文系成立了一个中文班，这是罗马尼亚唯一的中文班。现在这个班有九个学生，其中有的人为了学中文而放弃了已学习了一两年的专业。
    对外国朋友来说，学习中文可真不是件简单的事情，每个方块字在他们的眼里都是一幅神秘的“画”。巴洪大学中文班的学生，学习开始时也遇到了很多困难，首先就是发音。他们总觉得自己的舌头转不过弯来，四声总是弄不清，例如，经常把“麻”念成“马”。更困难的是写字，他们说，每学会写一个字都要经过一场“战斗”。但是对中国人民无限热爱的罗马尼亚学生，顽强地克服了这些困难。
    两年前，学生们听中国教员讲课还要通过翻译，现在已经不需要翻译就能听懂了。今天，他们已掌握了两千多个单字，去年他们开始同北京外国语学院罗马尼亚语文班的学生建立了通信联系，并且同中国青年通信，现在他们已收到中国朋友一千多封信了。
