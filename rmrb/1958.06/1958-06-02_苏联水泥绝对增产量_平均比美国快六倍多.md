Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The total cement output of the Soviet Union this year will reach approximately 37 million tons, an increase of about 8 million tons compared to last year. This is equivalent to more than 6.6 times the average annual cement production increase in the United States over the past four years.

In the four years leading up to 1957, the average annual absolute increase in cement production in the Soviet Union began to exceed that of the United States. During this period, the Soviet Union's average annual increase in cement production was 3.2 million tons, while the United States only increased by 1.2 million tons annually. And the Soviet Union's cement production increase this year alone will be one and a half times greater than the average increase of the past four years.

During the post-war period, the cement industries of many capitalist countries developed rapidly. However, even in the period from 1946 to 1952, the average annual cement increase in the United States was only slightly more than 2.2 million tons, in Britain only a little more than 770,000 tons, and in West Germany only slightly more than 1 million tons.

In order to meet the needs of increasingly expanding construction projects, the Soviet Union is building more large-scale cement plants. In recent years, cement industries will be established in all economic regions of the country that possess the raw materials for cement production. By 1960, the total production capacity of cement plants nationwide will increase to 67 million tons. By 1965, cement production in Kazakhstan, Siberia, Central Asia, and the Far East will increase by about two times compared to this year. Due to the rapid development of production, the total cement output of the Soviet Union is rapidly catching up with the United States. Last year, the United States produced 54 million tons of cement. According to the Soviet economic development plan, by 1960, the Soviet Union's cement production will increase to 52 million tons. According to Soviet newspapers, Soviet cement production could surpass the United States before 1965. And by 1972, the Soviet Union's cement production will reach 90 million to 110 million tons, almost twice the current cement production of the United States.

### 苏联水泥绝对增产量  平均比美国快六倍多

　　苏联水泥绝对增产量  平均比美国快六倍多
    据新华社讯　今年苏联水泥总产量将达到约三千七百万吨，即比去年增加约八百万吨，这等于美国过去四年每年水泥平均增产量的六点六倍以上。
    在到1957年为止的过去四年期间，苏联每年水泥平均绝对增产量开始超过美国。这个期间，苏联每年平均增产水泥三百二十万吨，美国每年只增产一百二十万吨。而苏联今年一年的水泥增产量还要比过去四年的平均增产量多一倍半。
    战后期间，许多资本主义国家水泥工业发展很快。然而，就在1946年到1952年的期间里，美国每年平均的水泥增产量也不过是二百二十多万吨，英国只有七十七万吨多一点，西德也不过是一百几十万吨。
    为了满足日益扩大的建筑工程的需要，苏联正在建设更多的大规模的水泥工厂。最近几年，全国所有拥有生产水泥的原料的经济区，都将建立起水泥工业。到1960年，全国水泥工厂的总生产能力将增加到六千七百万吨。到1965年，哈萨克、西伯利亚、中亚细亚和远东地区的水泥生产将比今年增加两倍左右。由于生产飞速发展，苏联的水泥总产量正在迅速地赶上美国。去年美国生产了五千四百万吨水泥。根据苏联经济发展计划，到1960年，苏联的水泥生产就将增加到五千二百万吨。据苏联报纸报道，在1965年以前，苏联的水泥产量就可以超过美国。而到1972年，苏联的水泥产量将达到九千万到一亿一千万吨，差不多等于目前美国水泥产量的两倍。
