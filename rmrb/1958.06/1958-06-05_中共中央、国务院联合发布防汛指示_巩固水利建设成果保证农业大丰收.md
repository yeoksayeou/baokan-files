Xinhua News Agency, June 4th. CCP Central Committee and State Council Directive on Strengthening Flood Control Work (June 4, 1958)

　　Now that southern China has entered the flood season and the summer floods in the north are approaching rapidly, the annual season of battling floods is once again upon us.

　　This year's flood control work has more distinctive characteristics than in previous years: it has unprecedentedly favorable conditions, but also more complex new situations and more arduous new tasks than in the past.

　　On the one hand, we must continue to carry out various flood control preparations as in previous years. On the other hand, we must also carry out flood control preparations for newly built water conservancy projects. At the same time, we must observe the changes caused by the newly built water conservancy projects. This is why this year's flood control work is particularly heavy compared to previous years.

　　The great leap forward in water conservancy project construction last winter and this spring undoubtedly greatly benefits our fight against floods. However, all these projects must undergo the test of two or three flood seasons to prove the role they can play in the fight against floods and to accurately estimate the actual effects of the projects. Therefore, before fully determining the effects of all these projects, we must make various flood control preparations as in previous years, being prepared for any eventuality. Any negligence, carelessness, complacency, or self-satisfaction is harmful. The struggle against water disasters is long-term, and the work of turning water disasters into water conservancy is also gradual and progressive. The projects carried out last winter and this spring can play a role in flood control and water storage to a certain extent, but beyond a certain limit, they may still bring a certain degree of disaster. Guangdong and the eight provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River suffered flooding of 24 million mu due to torrential rains in April and May. Because of the protection of the projects and timely rescue efforts, the area actually affected by the disaster was very small. This is a very good test. This point is particularly important in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Liao River, Songhua River, Huai River, and Hai River basins.

　　The water conservancy construction projects last winter and this spring covered a wide area and involved a large amount of work. The amount of earth and stone work alone reached 27 billion cubic meters, which is unprecedented in history, both at home and abroad. The projects covered every corner of the country, and the technical strength and technical guidance mainly relied on the peasants. Farmers who have not received education, or have only received very little education, have spent very little money and created many projects that scientific and technical experts have not done or dared to do. It is perfectly understandable that some of these projects may have some technical problems. In April and May, in Guangdong and the eight provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a very small number of small reservoirs, ponds, dams, and other projects were washed away by floods. In addition to the fact that the torrential rains had exceeded the limit, there may have been some problems in the quality of the projects and in the flood control work. Although this accounts for a very small proportion of the entire water conservancy project, this has already shown that it is a problem that must be paid attention to. Therefore, in this year's flood control preparation work, it is necessary to add such a task, that is, to carry out flood control and rescue work in the newly built water conservancy project areas. Before the flood season, in addition to carrying out preparations for flood control and rescue, we should also strictly check the quality of all projects once. When the flood season arrives, we should also organize forces to go to the mountains for flood control to ensure timely rescue of projects that may be washed away and timely repair of projects that have been washed away. Doing these tasks well is not only a task of fighting floods, but also a political task of continuing to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Maintaining the vigorous morale of the masses is the key to the development of water conservancy project construction.

　　Since last winter, the drought situation has been serious. In the struggle against the drought, many places have built dams in the river to block water for irrigation, and many places have breached dikes to divert water for irrigation, which has played a positive role in fighting the drought. What should be noted now is that some river dams must be removed before the flood season arrives, and river dike breaches must be repaired to facilitate the fight against floods. This is work that must be carried out immediately.

　　The water conservancy project construction last winter and this spring is different in principle from previous water conservancy project construction. The water conservancy project construction last winter and this spring was: mainly small-scale, mainly water storage, and mainly relying on community management; it was carried out on a vast scale, and it will definitely have an impact on hydrology. However, what kind of impact will it have and what kind of changes will it cause? This requires two or three flood seasons of field observation and the collection of considerable scientific data before conclusions can be drawn. Therefore, during this year's flood season, sufficient forces must be organized to carry out planned field observation work. At the same time, agricultural production cooperatives and farms should also establish rainfall stations, climate observation posts, and other organizations as much as possible to obtain more accurate scientific conclusions based on a wider range of data.

　　During the flood season, disputes over water conservancy between upstream and downstream areas and mutual support between regions should be based on the communist spirit of "small interests subordinate to large interests," "the part subordinate to the whole," and "everyone for me, I for everyone," breaking down departmentalism and the boundaries of townships, counties, prefectures, and provinces, strengthening unity, and mutually cooperating and supporting each other. The people of Jiangxi Province organized large-scale cooperation between mountainous areas, plains, upstream areas, and downstream areas under the attack of torrential rains, and overcame the floods. This experience is worth learning from in various places.

　　We must recognize that the success or failure of this year's flood control work is an important determining factor in whether we can guarantee a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. Therefore, leading party and government organs at all levels must mobilize urgently, immediately organize strong flood control command structures with the Party Committee as the core, go all out, aim high, and strive to consolidate the achievements of water conservancy construction and overcome this year's floods.

### 中共中央、国务院联合发布防汛指示  巩固水利建设成果保证农业大丰收

　　中共中央、国务院联合发布防汛指示
    巩固水利建设成果保证农业大丰收
    新华社4日讯　中共中央、国务院关于加强防汛工作的指示（1958年6月4日）
    现在我国南方已经进入汛期、北方的夏汛很快到来，一年一度和洪水搏斗的季节，又逼在眼前了。
    今年的防汛工作，有着和往年更多的特点：既有空前的有利条件，也有较过去更为复杂的新情况和更为繁重的新任务。
    一方面要继续和往年一样进行各种防汛准备工作，另一方面又必须对新修的水利工程进行防汛准备工作，同时还要对新修水利工程所引起的变化进行观察工作，这就是今年防汛工作比往年特别繁重的原因。
    去冬今春水利工程建设的大跃进，无疑问的是大大有利于我们和洪水斗争。但是所有这些工程都必须经过二、三个汛期的考验，才能证明它在对洪水斗争中所能发挥的作用，才能准确地估计工程的实际效果。因此在没有完全判明所有这些工程的效果之前，必须和往年一样作好各种防汛准备，有备无患，任何疏忽大意麻痹自满，都是有害的。和水害作斗争是长期的，把水害变为水利的工作也是逐步进行和逐步提高的。去冬今春所进行的工程，在一定限度内，是能起到拦洪蓄水作用的，但超过了一定限度，仍然可能带来一定程度的灾害。广东和长江中、下游八省在四、五两月暴雨袭击下，已有二千四百万亩遭受水淹，因为有了工程的保护和及时的抢救，真正成灾面积很少，这是一个很好的考验。这一点特别在长江、黄河、辽河、松花江、淮河、海河流域要注意。
    去冬今春水利建设工程面广量大，仅土石方即达二百七十亿公方，这是古今中外的历史上都没有过的，工程遍及全国每一个角落，技术力量和技术指导主要是依靠农民。没有读过书，或只读过很少书的农民，花很少的钱，作出了许多科学技术专家没有作过或者不敢作的工程，其中少数工程在技术上可能存在一些问题，这是完全可以理解的。在四、五月间广东和长江中、下游八省，有很小数量的小水库、塘坝和其他工程被水冲坏，除了暴雨已超过限度以外，在工程质量上和防汛工作上，可能存在一些问题，这在整个水利工程中所占的比重虽然极小，但这已说明是一个要注意的问题。因此在今年防汛准备工作上，必须增加这样一个任务，即在新修的水利工程地区进行防汛抢险工作。在汛期前除了进行防汛抢险的准备工作外，还应严格检查一次所有工程的质量；在汛期到来时，还要组织力量上山防汛，以保证及时抢救可能被冲坏的工程，和及时修复已经被冲坏的工程。作好这些工作，不仅是一个和洪水作斗争的任务，而且是一个继续发扬群众积极性和创造性的政治任务。保持群众的兴旺士气，是发展水利工程建设的关键。
    去冬以来旱情严重，在和旱情作斗争中，不少地方在河内打坝拦水灌溉，不少地方扒堤引水灌溉，对抗旱起了积极作用。现在要注意的是，在汛期到来之前有些拦河坝必须推掉，河堤缺口必须修复，才有利于和洪水作斗争，这是必须立即进行的工作。
    去冬今春水利工程建设和以往水利工程建设，在方针上是不相同的。去冬今春的水利工程建设是：以小型为主，以蓄水为主，依靠社办为主；是在广大的面上进行的，它对水文一定会发生影响的。但是，究竟会发生什么样的影响，引起什么样的变化，这就需要经过二、三个汛期的实地观察，收集相当的科学数据，才能得出结论。因此，在今年汛期中，必须组织足够的力量，进行有计划的实地观察工作；同时各个农业生产合作社和农场，也应尽可能的设立雨量站，气候观察哨等组织，求得在更广泛的数据的基础上，得出较为准确的科学结论。
    在汛期中，有关上、下游的水利纠纷和地区之间的相互支援问题，应本“小利服从大利”、“局部服从整体”、“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义精神，打破本位主义和乡、县、专、省的区划界限，加强团结，互相协作支援。江西省人民在暴雨袭击下，组织了山区、平原、上游、下游的大协作，战胜了洪水，这个经验值得各地学习。
    我们必须认识：今年防汛工作的好坏，是能否保证今年农业大丰收的一个重要决定因素。因此，各级党政领导机关必须紧张动员起来，立即组织起以党委为核心的坚强的防汛指挥机构，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为巩固水利建设的成果和战胜今年的洪水而斗争。
