Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: According to TASS, Paris, June 5th: Responding to the call of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, the French people have begun donating funds to be used for the anti-fascist and republic-defending struggle. More than two million francs have been raised in the past few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 5th: The Executive Committee of the French Socialist Party passed a resolution on the evening of June 4th, deciding to postpone indefinitely the Party Congress originally scheduled to open on the 19th of this month. Political observers here believe that this is because the right-wing leadership group of the party fears that the Congress will expose the deep rift between them and the broad masses of lower-level party members, which could lead to their failure in the election of the leadership. This rift has become wider and deeper due to the support of the right-wing leaders, headed by Mollet, for De Gaulle's rise to power and their participation in the De Gaulle government.

This traitorous behavior of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party has been fiercely condemned by the Republicans within the party. The journal "Socialist Forum," representing the left-wing forces within the Socialist Party, called the Socialists who caused the current situation in France and participated in the De Gaulle government traitors to the Republic in its latest issue. It pointed out that the majority of Socialist parliamentarians opposed De Gaulle's rise to power. It issued an appeal to all Socialist Party members, demanding that they remove from leadership positions these "people who have tarnished the reputation of the Socialist Party and caused political, economic, and moral disasters for the country."

    法国人民响应法共号召
    募集反法西斯斗争的基金
    社会党下层党员不满摩勒集团投靠戴高乐
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社巴黎5日讯：响应法国共产党中央委员会的号召，法国人民开始捐款充作进行反法西斯和保卫共和国斗争的基金。几天来已经募集了二百多万法郎。
    据新华社巴黎5日电　法国社会党执行委员会4日晚间通过决议，决定把原定本月19日开幕的党代表大会无限期延期。此间政治观察家认为，这是因为该党右翼领导集团担心代表大会会暴露他们同广大下层党员之间的深刻裂隙，从而使他们在领导机构的改选中可能遭到失败。这种裂隙由于以摩勒为首的右翼领导人支持戴高乐上台和参加戴高乐政府，已经更趋扩大和加深。
    社会党右翼领导人的这种叛卖行为受到了党内拥护共和人士的猛烈谴责。代表社会党内左翼力量的刊物“社会主义论坛”在最近一期中把那些造成法国目前状况和参加戴高乐政府的社会党人叫做共和国的叛徒。它指出，多数社会党议员反对戴高乐上台。它向社会党全体党员发出呼吁，要求他们把这些“使社会党信誉扫地并且使国家遭到政治、经济和道义上的灾难的人们”从领导岗位上撤换下来。
