    新华社布加勒斯特23日电  世界著名的罗马尼亚运动员约兰达·巴拉斯继6月7日打破世界女子跳高纪录之后，22日再一步跃进，把这个纪录提高两公分，达到了一点八○公尺的高峰。
    巴拉斯是22日上午在克罗什举行的罗马尼亚田径团体锦标赛上创造出这个成绩的。这个运动会上将选拔参加今年欧洲田径锦标赛的罗马尼亚选手。
    近来，巴拉斯竞技情况非常良好。21日她再次跳过了一点七五公尺。22日她从一点六○公尺起跳，一跃即过，接着一点七○公尺、一点七六公尺也都是一次就跳过了。在跳一点八○公尺时，第一次失败，但是第二次她出色地飞跃过了这个世界上女运动员从来没有达到过的高度。
    今年6月7日她曾在布加勒斯特跳过一点七八公尺，从而打破了中国运动员郑凤荣保持的一点七七公尺的正式世界纪录。
