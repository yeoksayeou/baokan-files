　　Cicadas Sing, Lychees are Red
　　Chen Jing

　　In summer, when the cicadas sing, they tell people that the lychees in the South are ripe.

　　Lychees have existed in southern China as early as the Qin and Han dynasties. In the Han dynasty, they were already used as tributes; in the Jin dynasty, they became offerings to the "Grand Temple." By the Tang and Song dynasties, poets had developed a fondness for them. Bai Juyi wrote a "Preface to the Lychee Picture," giving a detailed introduction to lychees. Su Shi was even more interested in lychees, as evidenced by his poem: "If I eat three hundred lychees every day, I wouldn't mind being a Lingnan person forever."

　　Lychees are a specialty of southern China. They were introduced to Thailand, India, the United States, and the coast of South Africa in the early 20th century. The "Brewster Lychee," which is widely grown in the United States today, is propagated from the "Chen Zi Lychee," a famous variety brought from Putian County, Fujian Province, China, by the American missionary William Brewster after 1904.

　　Lychee, also known as Lizhi or Danli, is a subtropical plant belonging to the Sapindaceae family. It is grown in Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Guangxi (Autonomous Region) provinces of China, with Fujian being the most famous for its produce. The lychee tree is as tall as two or three zhang (approximately 6.6-10 meters), and the trunk is thick enough to require both arms to encircle it. Its lifespan is extremely long. A lychee tree in Fuzhou's Xichan Temple that is about a thousand years old can still blossom and bear fruit this year. There are many varieties, with "Yuan Hong" being the best: it has a lot of flesh, rich juice, and high sugar content (15.675 grams of sugar per 100 grams of flesh), and is rich in Vitamin C (47.66 milligrams per 100 grams of flesh). Its core can be divided into two types: small (burnt) core and large core, with the burnt core being the best of the lychees.

　　Fresh lychees are not easy to preserve and transport, just as the ancient poet Bai Juyi said: "If separated from the original branch, the color changes in one day, the aroma changes in two days, the taste changes in three days, and after four or five days, the color, aroma, and taste are all gone." Although China is a vast country, transportation is now convenient, and large northern cities such as Beijing and Tianjin can also taste fresh lychees from the South.

　　Lychees are not only delicious, but also the skin, pit, flower, bark, and roots can all be used as medicinal materials. "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that lychee "fruit can quench thirst and improve complexion; pit mainly treats small intestine qi pain, hernia pain, and blood qi pain in women; shell mainly treats smallpox; flowers, skin, and roots mainly treat sore throat and swelling." In eastern Fujian, lychee shells are still used to treat colds, and pits are used to treat hernias.

    知了叫，荔枝红
    陈景
    夏天，知了（蝉）叫了，它告诉人们：南方荔枝成熟了。
    我国南方，早在秦汉时代就已经有了荔枝。汉代已充作贡品；晋代，成了“太庙”的供品。到了唐、宋，诗人们对它发生了好感。白居易写过“荔枝图序”，对荔枝作了详尽的介绍。苏轼对荔枝的兴趣更大，有诗为证：“日啖荔枝三百颗，不妨长作岭南人”。
    荔枝是我国南方的特产，传到泰国、印度、美国和南非洲沿岸等地，那是二十世纪初年的事。现在美国大量种植的“蒲氏荔枝”，就是1904年以后，由美国传教士蒲为廉从我国福建莆田县带去的“陈紫荔枝”名种繁殖的。
    荔枝，又名离枝、丹荔，为亚热带植物，属无患子科。我国福建、台湾、广东、四川、广西（自治区）等省都有种植，其中以福建所产为最著名。荔枝树高达二、三丈，树干粗到要合抱。它的寿命极长，福州西禅寺的一棵千年左右的荔枝树，今年还能开花结果。它的品种繁多，其中以“元红”为最优：果肉多，果汁浓，糖份高（每百克果肉中就有一五点六七五糖分克的糖份），维生素丙含量丰富（每百克果肉内含四七点六六毫克）。它的核可分为焦（小）核与大核两类，以焦核为荔枝中的佳品。
    新鲜的荔枝不易保藏、运输，正像古诗人白居易说过的：“若离本枝，一日而色变，二日而香变，三日而味变，四、五日外，则色、香、味尽去矣”。虽然我国地区辽阔，但是现在交通方便，北方的大城市如北京、天津等地，也能尝到南方新鲜的荔枝了。
    荔枝不但果肉甜美，而且皮、核、花、树皮和根都可以充作药材。本草纲目说荔枝的“实，能止渴，益人颜色；核，主治小肠气痛，?疝气痛，妇人血气刺痛；壳，主治痘疮；花及皮、根主治喉痹肿痛。”现在闽东一带还有以荔枝壳治伤风感冒，以核治疝气的。
