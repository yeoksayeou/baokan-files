　　For a Common Goal
　　——A Record of Obligatory Labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site by Envoys from Brotherly Countries

    The surging floodwaters will soon be tamed by the dam of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. The people working diligently here will forever remember that on that high dam, there is also soil piled up by envoys and embassy staff from eleven brotherly countries, including Korea, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Mongolia, Vietnam, Romania, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union. For the sake of the noble friendship of proletarian internationalism, they shed their sweat here.

    When the Bulgarian Ambassador, Mr. Gargov, participated in the voluntary labor at the construction site, he said to the reservoir builders, "We are here to participate in labor and exercise, to build the reservoir with everyone, for socialism, for communism, to achieve our common goal!"

    His words expressed the common feelings of the envoys from the eleven brotherly countries who came to participate in the voluntary labor.

    Comrades from the Soviet Embassy, led by Counselor Gutikov, and comrades from the Polish Embassy, led by Ambassador Kirillok, participated in labor side by side at the Ming Tombs Reservoir on May 31. Ambassador Kirillok was wearing a short shirt and shorts, and "Warrior" brand shoes. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he immersed himself in hard work. From the beginning to the end of the labor, the basket on his shoulder, filled with soil, never left him. Ambassador Kirillok's wife and many female comrades from the embassy also refused to lag behind, and they were responsible for shoveling soil into the baskets.

    In the labor team of 93 people from the Soviet Embassy, many had participated in the labor of the first five-year construction plan in the Soviet Union. They kept carrying soil and shoveling soil at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, sweating profusely, their clothes soaked in sweat, but no one was willing to rest for a moment. In the labor, they broke up the large pieces of soil and picked out the roots of grass. They said: This is our own cause! Counselor Gutikov, Comrade Velikhachkin, and Commercial Representative Yeremin also launched a soil-carrying competition with the young comrades of the embassy.

    Many comrades from the two embassies rubbed their hands raw during the labor. After bandaging them, they immediately devoted themselves to the intense labor again. Before leaving the construction site, Ambassador Kirillok and Counselor Gutikov left messages through the construction site broadcasting station, wishing the 100,000 builders of the reservoir to build this reservoir, which symbolizes the great leap forward of China's socialist construction, quickly and well.

    The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy, ​​Moon Jae-joo, and the embassy staff arrived at the reservoir construction site in the first batch on the morning of April 13, and immediately joined the reservoir builders in intense labor. Some shoveled soil, some carried soil, their clothes soaked with sweat, and while working, they shouted "Leap forward! Leap forward!" in Chinese. The five members of the "May Fourth" youth assault team of the Tenth Brigade of migrant workers were all demobilized soldiers who had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. After hearing the news that the Korean Embassy staff had arrived at the construction site, they specially came to work alongside them. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Moon Jae-joo and demobilized soldier Liang Yizhang carried a large basket of soil together, running back and forth quickly. Moon Jae-joo said: "Everywhere in China, you can meet Chinese People's Volunteers demobilized soldiers who supported us. They are the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. In the past, they fought side by side with us against imperialism; today, we have met again to jointly participate in the labor of building socialism. We are very happy."

    The Czechoslovak Ambassador, Mr. Bušiak, the Bulgarian Ambassador, Mr. Gargov, the wife of the Albanian Ambassador, Mrs. Balliri, and the embassy staff of these three countries made an appointment to come on May 16. After entering the construction site, they immediately took off their tops, wore shorts, some bare-armed, and ran with soil baskets on their shoulders. Ambassador Bušiak wrapped his head with a handkerchief. He has been doing the work of carrying soil, and he loaded it fully and ran fast. Although Ambassador Gargov, who is over sixty years old, is full of gray hair, he still shovels soil so vigorously. The wife of Ambassador Balliri and the female comrades of the three countries' embassies repeatedly asked to load more soil when carrying it. They always talked and laughed during the labor, and sang songs as soon as they rested. Before leaving, Ambassador Bušiak spoke on behalf of the embassy staff of the three countries to all the reservoir builders at the construction site broadcasting station. He enthusiastically said: "Today, we are building this huge reservoir together with you. Although our strength is not great, this shows that the people of our three countries are all with you, and will always be with you in the future."

    The Mongolian guests led by Ambassador Lubsan and the Vietnamese guests led by Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Pham Binh burst with enthusiasm and were full of energy. They worked almost as hard as the reservoir migrant workers who had been working for a long time. At the end of a day of happy labor, the staff of the Vietnamese and Mongolian embassies and the reservoir builders performed many programs for each other, held hands and sang "Unity is Strength" and "The East is Red." Finally, they toasted with the migrant workers, students, and soldiers. It turned out that the wine was specially brought by the Mongolian Ambassador Lubsan and the embassy staff. To celebrate the friendship forged by the sweat of labor, they shared a drink with the Chinese builders.

    The German Democratic Republic Ambassador, Mr. Wandell, the Second Secretary of the Hungarian Embassy, ​​Mr. Göndör, and the embassy staff of the two countries worked together with the "Women's Pioneer Team" of the Twelfth Brigade of migrant workers on the same day, as close as a family. The envoys and embassy staff of the two countries repeatedly insisted on not resting and modestly expressed that they had not worked much. The friendship forged by working together made people reluctant to separate for a long time. When the staff of the two countries' embassies were about to leave, they held arms to arms with the reservoir builders for a long time, forming a circle, and repeatedly shouted "Long live Sino-German, Sino-Hungarian friendship!"

    The Romanian Ambassador, Mr. Rudenko, and the embassy staff met the famous "Nine Orchid Team" on the construction site during the labor. When Ambassador Rudenko talked to the "Nine Orchid Team" about the construction achievements of the new China, he said: "I came to China before liberation. At that time, the Chinese people were oppressed by imperialism and its running dogs, and lived a life of not having enough to eat and wear. But today's new China is making great strides everywhere. It is really hard to see the traces of the old China." The nine members of the "Nine Orchid Team" are all outstanding female members of the Yuanfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative. They have created many moving heroic deeds at the reservoir construction site. Because it happens that each person's name has the orchid character in it, so it is named "Nine Orchid Team". Ambassador Rudenko encouraged the "Nine Orchid Team" to continue their efforts and maintain their glory.

    So many envoys from brotherly countries working and laughing together with our country's builders on one construction site, people regard this as a vivid embodiment of the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The sweat shed by the envoys and diplomatic officials on the construction site has become a great encouragement in the construction process of the reservoir. Every time they came to the construction site, the headquarters continuously received many letters of thanks, resolutions, and pledges, expressing their determination to create greater construction achievements to repay the international friends with practical actions. A reservoir builder named Li Zhenfu published a poem entitled "To International Friends" in a recent issue of the "Ming Tombs Reservoir News," vividly expressing this feeling of the people. He wrote:

    On the flood dam like a high mountain,
    There is the sticky soil you carried,
    There is the sweat you shed.
    Sweat soaks the sticky soil,
    The dam body is more solid than a copper wall and iron wall.
    You care about the Ming Tombs Reservoir,
    Just like caring about your own country's construction.
    You love the Ming Tombs Reservoir,
    Just like loving your own baby.
    This great spirit of internationalism,
    Will be forever engraved on the socialist flood dam.

　　为了共同的目标
　　——兄弟国家使节十三陵水库工地义务劳动记
　　新华社记者　袁木  于民生
    滚滚洪水不久就将驯服在十三陵水库的拦河坝下，在这里辛勤劳动的人们将永远记住，在那高高的大坝上，也有来自朝、保、捷、阿、蒙、越、罗、德、匈、波、苏等十一个兄弟国家驻华使节和使馆人员垒起的泥土。为了无产阶级国际主义的崇高友谊，他们在这里洒下了自己的汗水。
    保加利亚大使?加尔科夫在参加工地义务劳动时对水库建设者们说：“我们来参加劳动锻炼，来同大家一起修水库，是为了社会主义，为了共产主义，为了实现我们共同的目标！”
    他的这段话，道出了十一个兄弟国家使节前来参加义务劳动的共同心情。
    由顾悌克夫参赞率领的苏联大使馆同志和由基里洛克大使率领的波兰大使馆同志，5月31日在十三陵水库并肩参加劳动。基里洛克大使身着短衫短裤，脚穿力士鞋。他一到工地就埋头苦干起来，从劳动开始到结束，那副装满泥土的筐担一直没有离开过他的肩头。基里洛克大使的夫人和大使馆的许多女同志也不甘落后，她们担任的是铲土入筐的工作。
    在九十三人组成的苏联大使馆的劳动队伍里，有不少人参加过苏联第一个五年建设计划的劳动，他们在十三陵水库工地上不停地挑土和铲土，累得满头大汗，衣服浸在汗水里，但谁也不肯休息一会儿。他们在劳动中把大块的泥土打碎，拣出了草根。他们说：这是我们自己的事业！参赞顾悌克夫和魏立夏金同志，商务代表叶烈敏同志，还同大使馆的青年同志展开了挑土竞赛。
    两国大使馆有许多同志在劳动中磨破了手，他们包扎一下，马上又投入了紧张的劳动。在离开工地以前，基里洛克大使和顾悌克夫参赞通过工地广播站留下了赠言，他们祝水库的十万建设者把这座象征中国社会主义建设大跃进的水库，建筑得又快又好。
    朝鲜大使馆临时代办文在洙和使馆人员，在4月13日早晨第一批到达水库工地，立刻就同水库建设者一起，投入紧张的劳动。他们有的铲土，有的担土，汗水湿透了衣衫，一边干还一边用中国话喊着“跃进！跃进！”。民工十大队“五四”青年突击组的五个组员，都是参加过抗美援朝战争的复员军人，他们听到朝鲜大使馆人员来到工地的消息以后，特地赶来同他们并肩劳动。文在洙临时代办同复员军人梁益章合抬一大筐土，往来飞奔。文在洙说：“在中国各地都可以碰到支援过我们的中国人民志愿军复员军人，他们是中国人民的优秀儿女，过去同我们并肩作战，共同反对帝国主义；今天，我们又碰到了一起，共同参加建设社会主义的劳动，我们感到非常高兴。”
    捷克斯洛伐克大使布希尼亚克、保加利亚大使?加尔科夫、阿尔巴尼亚大使巴利里的夫人和这三个国家的使馆人员，在5月16日这一天相约而来。他们进入工地以后，马上脱下上衣，穿着短裤，有的赤着臂膀，担起土筐就飞奔起来。布希尼亚克大使用手绢包上头，他一直做挑土的工作，而且装的满，跑的快。年过六旬的?加尔科夫大使虽已满头银发，但铲起土来还是那么有力。巴利里大使的夫人和三个国家大使馆的女同志，她们抬土时再三要求多装，劳动中总是又说又笑，一休息就唱起了歌。临别前，布希尼亚克大使代表三国使馆人员在工地广播站向全体水库建设者讲话，他热情地说：“今天同你们一起来修建这座巨大的水库，我们的力量虽然是不大的，但这是表明我们三个国家的全体人民都同你们在一起，并且今后将永远在一起。”
    以鲁布桑大使为首的蒙古客人和以范平临时代办为首的越南客人们热情迸发，干劲十足。他们干起活来几乎不亚于经过长时期劳动锻炼的水库民工。在结束一天的愉快劳动时，越南、蒙古两国使馆人员同水库建设者们一起，互相演出了许多节目，手挽着手合唱起“团结就是力量”和“东方红”，他们最后还同民工、学生和部队战士们一起干起杯来。原来，这酒是蒙古大使鲁布桑和使馆人员特意带来的。为了庆祝用劳动的汗水结成的友谊，他们同中国建设者们共饮一杯。
    民主德国大使汪戴尔、匈牙利大使馆二等秘书高恩德和两国使馆人员，同一天和民工十二大队的“妇女先锋队”在一起共同劳动，亲密得像一家人。两国使节和使馆人员一再坚持不休息，还谦逊地表示他们劳动得不多。共同劳动结成的友谊使得人们久久地不愿分离，两国使馆人员临别的时候，同水库建设者们长时间地臂膀挽着臂膀，围成一个圆圈，一再高呼“中德中匈友谊万岁！”
    罗马尼亚鲁登科大使和使馆人员在劳动中会见了工地上著名的“九兰组”。鲁登科大使在向“九兰组”谈到新中国的建设成就时说：“解放以前我来过中国，那时中国人民受着帝国主义及其走狗的压迫，过着吃不饱穿不暖的生活，而今天的新中国到处都在跃进，真是很难看出旧中国的痕迹了。”“九兰组”的九个成员都是园丰农业生产合作社的优秀女社员，她们在水库工地曾经创造出许多动人的英雄事迹，因为碰巧每个人的名字中都有一个兰花的兰字，所以就取名叫“九兰组”。鲁登科大使鼓励“九兰组”要继续努力，保持光荣。
    这样多兄弟国家的使节，在一个工地上同我国建设者们一起劳动，一起欢笑，人们都把这件事看做是无产阶级国际主义精神的生动体现。使节和外交官员们在工地上流下的汗水，已经在水库的建设过程中变成很大的鼓舞力量。每次他们来到工地，指挥部都曾连续不断地接到许多感谢信，决心书和保证书，表示要创造出更大的建设成绩，以实际行动来答谢国际友人。一位名字叫做李震夫的水库建设者，在最近一期“十三陵水库报”上发表的一首题为“致国际友人”的诗，生动地表达了人们的这种心情。他写道：
    在高山似的拦洪坝上，
    有你们担来的粘土，
    有你们流过的汗水。
    汗水浸湿粘土，
    坝身凝结得比铜墙铁壁还要坚固。
    你们关怀十三陵水库，
    就像关怀自己国家的建设事业。
    你们热爱十三陵水库，
    就像热爱自己的婴儿。
    这种伟大的国际主义精神，
    将永远铭刻在社会主义的拦洪坝上。
