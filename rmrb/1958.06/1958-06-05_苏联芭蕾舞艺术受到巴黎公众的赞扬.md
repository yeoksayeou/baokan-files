Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 2nd: Parisian newspapers have published numerous articles commenting on the performances of the Soviet State Bolshoi Theatre Ballet Company. Theatre critics unanimously pointed out the high level of skill of the Soviet ballet dancers.

	"Le Parisien Libéré" gave a high evaluation of Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet." The newspaper wrote: "Every bar of this drama is so beautiful and magnificent that it makes one feel not as if watching a ballet, but as if being in a rich and colorful myth."

	The newspaper said: "Ulanova's dancing skills are unimaginably admirable. She keeps the audience's eyes glued to her. The Juliet performed in the past has never had such passion, sorrow, and moving qualities." "Paris Radical News" pointed out that Ulanova's "indisputable style, elegance, lightness, and agility are delightful."

	"Le Parisien" wrote that the Bolshoi Theatre's orchestra, under the baton of Rozhdestvensky, "created miracles."

    苏联芭蕾舞艺术受到巴黎公众的赞扬
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社巴黎2日讯：巴黎各报刊登许多文章，评论苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞舞蹈团的演出。戏剧评论家们一致指出苏联芭蕾舞演员的高度技艺。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”对普罗科菲耶夫的“罗米欧与朱丽叶”给了很高的评价。这家报纸写道：“这个戏剧的每一个小节都是这样美妙、壮丽，因此使人感觉到并不是在观看芭蕾舞，而是处身在丰富多采的神话中。”
    这家报纸说：“乌兰诺娃的舞技出乎想像的令人赞叹。她使观众们目不转睛。过去演出的朱丽叶从来没有这样的热情、悲愁和令人感动”。“巴黎激进新闻”指出，乌兰诺娃的“无可非议的风格、优雅、轻盈和灵活令人感到欣喜”。
    “巴黎日报”写道，大剧院的乐队在罗日杰斯特文斯基的指挥下“创造了奇迹”。
