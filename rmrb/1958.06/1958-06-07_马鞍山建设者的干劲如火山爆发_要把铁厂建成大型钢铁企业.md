　　Ma'anshan construction workers' enthusiasm erupts like a volcano
    To build the iron factory into a large-scale iron and steel enterprise
    (Our report) According to Anhui Daily: More than 20,000 production and construction workers of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Complex, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, have proposed another ambitious construction plan. They are determined to expand the Ma'anshan Iron Factory, originally planned to be expanded into a medium-sized iron and steel complex by 1960, into a large-scale iron and steel complex within the same period, without increasing the total investment. This will reduce the investment per ton of steel by 60% compared to building a new large-scale iron and steel complex, and by more than 30% compared to a small or medium-sized iron and steel complex. After the expansion project is put into production in 1960, the annual output of various products will be as follows: ore will increase from the original plan of 4 million tons to 6 million tons, pig iron will increase from the original plan of 1.5 million tons to 2 million to 2.3 million tons, steel will increase from the original plan of 500,000 tons to 1 million to 1.5 million tons, and coke will increase from the original plan of 900,000 tons to 1.8 million tons.
    Recently, in accordance with the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has delegated the entire investment for expanding the Ma'anshan Iron Factory into a medium-sized iron and steel complex to the factory for contracted use. This has brought great encouragement and strength to the builders of Ma'anshan. The Ma'anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately proposed to all employees: an emergency general mobilization, two and a half years of hard work, investment one equals two, output doubles, learn multiple skills, one person equals two; use machines in multiple ways, one machine equals two; consider light rain as a good day, consider working under lights as working in daylight, save money everywhere, and implement a large contract system. These fighting slogans have stimulated everyone's vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, and many units have expressed their determination to contribute their greatest strength to the early completion of this iron and steel complex.
    Currently, some of the blueprints for this iron and steel complex have been delivered, and two large blast furnaces with an effective volume of 620 cubic meters and two sets of coke ovens will soon break ground, and one or two larger modern blast furnaces will also begin construction soon. The five medium-sized blast furnaces that started earlier in this iron and steel complex have also entered a stage of intense installation. The workers guarantee that these five medium-sized blast furnaces will be put into production one month ahead of the original Leap Forward plan.
    (Our report) According to Anhui Daily: In order to quickly solve the problem of raw material supply for the current development of local industry, the first Anhui Steel Plant built in Anhui Province with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel has decided to further expand on the existing basis to become an iron and steel complex with an annual output of 500,000 tons of pig iron, 300,000 tons of steel ingots, and capable of producing various medium-sized steel, seamless steel pipes, medium plates, thin plates, wire rods, and large forgings.
    The steelmaking workshop of this plant, which was originally planned to be completed and produce steel by the end of October this year, has also decided to be completed by the end of August, striving to formally produce steel on September 1.

### 马鞍山建设者的干劲如火山爆发  要把铁厂建成大型钢铁企业

　　马鞍山建设者的干劲如火山爆发
    要把铁厂建成大型钢铁企业
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：马鞍山钢铁联合企业的两万多名生产建设者，在总路线的光辉照耀
  下，又提出一个雄伟豪迈的建设计划。他们决心在投资总数不增加的情况下，将原来准备在1960年把马鞍山铁厂扩建成中型钢铁联合企业，改为在同期内扩建成大型钢铁联合企业。这样就可使每吨钢的投资比新建大型钢铁联合企业降低60％，比中小型钢铁联合企业降低30％以上。到1960年扩建工程投入生产后，各种产品的年产量如下：矿石由原计划四百万吨增加到六百万吨，生铁由原计划一百五十万吨增加到二百至二百三十万吨，钢由原计划五十万吨增加到一百万到一百五十万吨，焦炭由原计划九十万吨增加到一百八十万吨。
    最近，冶金工业部根据鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，把扩建马鞍山铁厂为中型钢铁联合企业的全部投资，下放给这个厂包干使用。这给马鞍山建设者带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。中共马鞍山市委立即向全体职工提出：紧急总动员，苦战二年半，投资一当二，产量加一翻，人学多面手，一人抵两人；机械多面用，一台抵两台；大小雨当好天，灯光下面当白天，处处少花钱，实行大包干的战斗口号，激发了大家旺盛的革命干劲，许多单位都表示决心要为提早建成这个钢铁联合企业献出最大的力量。
    现在，这个钢铁联合企业的部分图纸已经交付，两座有效容积为六百二十立方公尺的大高炉和两组炼焦炉很快就要破土开工，还有一座或两座更大的现代高炉不久也将动工兴建。这个钢铁联合企业先期开工的五座中型高炉也已进入紧张的安装阶段。职工们保证这五座中型高炉比原订跃进计划再提前一个月投入生产。
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：为了迅速解决当前发展地方工业的原材料供应问题，安徽省新建的第一座年产五万吨钢材的安徽钢厂，决定在原有基础上进一步扩建成为年产五十万吨生铁、三十万吨钢锭，并能够生产各种中型钢材、无缝钢管、中板、薄板、线材和大型锻件的钢铁联合企业。
    这个厂原计划在今年10月底建成出钢的炼钢车间，也决定提前在8月底建成，争取在9月1日正式出钢。
