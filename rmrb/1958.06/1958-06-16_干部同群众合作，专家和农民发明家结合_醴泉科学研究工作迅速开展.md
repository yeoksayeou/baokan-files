    Cadres Cooperate with the Masses, Experts Combine with Peasant Inventors
    Liquean County's Scientific Research Work Develops Rapidly

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Liquean County, Shaanxi Province, has broken down the mysterious thinking about science and technology, cut away the inferiority complex of self-deprecation, and scientific research work throughout the county has developed rapidly. From May 17th to now, in just over twenty days, after the establishment of the county's Agricultural Science Research Institute and the烽火 (Beacon Fire), 明星 (Star), 白鸽 (White Dove) agricultural cooperatives' three scientific research offices, the first batch of thirty-two research topics was formulated, and experimental research work began. The second batch of research topics related to agricultural tool and machinery reform, soil improvement, and crop rotation is also being formulated. In addition, preparations are being made to hold scientific discussion meetings on wheat, cotton, and corn after the autumn harvest, to build a weather station, and to establish indoor and outdoor exhibitions and research institutes.

    The thirty-two research topics that have been determined are all to solve the urgent problems that need to be solved in current production. This year, the county wants to become a "hundred-catty ginned cotton county," and nine topics are on the research and summary of cotton yield increase techniques and high-yield experience. There are also special topics such as variety comparison experiments and intercropping research for major crops such as corn and wheat. These topics have been researched separately. Luo Fengying, a young woman from the White Dove Cooperative, is using new cotton field management techniques in her cotton high-yield field, and through research and experimentation, she wants to strive for a yield of 2,300 catties of seed cotton per mu. The farm responsible for the variety comparison experiments of various crops has recently completed the sowing task of more than 30 kinds of improved corn varieties.

    These research topics are all based on high-yield experimental fields, selecting those with good conditions for systematic scientific guidance and improvement, with cadres cooperating with the masses and experts combining with "native experts." Therefore, the number of participants is very extensive, and work is progressing rapidly. This year, cadres and members of various agricultural cooperatives in the county have many high-yield fields and experimental fields. There are 2,081 people with corn high-yield experimental fields with a yield of 1,500 catties per mu, and 1,395 people who want to produce 1,000 catties of seed cotton per mu. Those participating in scientific research work include leading cadres at all levels, veteran farmers, model workers, as well as professors, lecturers, and students from the Northwest Agricultural College who have been sent down for training or specially invited. Sun Mingcai, deputy secretary of the Liquean County Party Committee, and Zhe Jingying, the county magistrate, with the help of Su Xianzhong, associate professor of the Northwest Agricultural College, are comprehensively responsible for the integrated research on cotton yield increase through their own research and experimental fields, and will write a report after realizing the "hundred-catty ginned cotton county." Professor Zhao Hongzhang, the cultivator of the famous wheat variety "Bima No. 1," is cooperating with model worker Wang Baojing to conduct intercropping experiments with barley, sweet potatoes, corn, and millet for five harvests a year, with a yield of 5,500 catties per mu. While carrying out mass scientific research, the county has also launched a mass movement to learn science and technology. At present, 216 civil agricultural technology schools have been established in the county's 289 agricultural cooperatives. Currently, these technical schools are focusing on teaching cotton cultivation techniques to the masses in order to achieve the goal of becoming a "hundred-catty ginned cotton county." Through these more than 8,000 students, various advanced cotton planting techniques will be taught and guided to 150,000 members. This mass movement of scientific and technological learning provides favorable conditions for conducting scientific research.

    干部同群众合作，专家和农民发明家结合
    醴泉科学研究工作迅速开展
    本报讯　陕西省醴泉县打破对科学技术的神秘思想，砍掉妄自菲薄的自卑心理，全县科学研究工作迅速开展。从5月17日到现在，短短的二十多天内，建立了县农业科学研究所和烽火、明星、白鸽农业社三个科学研究室之后，制定出第一批三十二个研究专题，开始试验、研究工作。第二批有关农具机械改革、土壤改良、轮作等研究专题，也着手制定。此外，还准备秋收后办小麦、棉花、玉米三种作物的科学讨论会，筹建一个气象站，建立室内、室外展览和研究所。
    已确定的三十二个研究题目，都是为了解决当前生产迫切需要解决的问题，今年，这个县要实现百斤皮棉县，九个题目都是研究、总结棉花增产技术措施和丰产经验的。还有玉米、小麦等主要作物的品种比较试验和套种研究等专题。这些题目已经分头进行研究，白鸽社青年妇女罗凤英的一块棉花丰产田，正采用新的棉田管理技术措施，通过研究试验要争取亩产籽棉二千三百斤。负责各类作物品种比较试验的农场，最近也完成了三十多种玉米良种的播种任务。
    这些研究专题都是在丰产试验田基础上，选择条件好的加以系统的科学指导和提高，干部同群众合作，专家和“土专家”结合。因此，参加人数很广泛，工作进展迅速。今年，这个县的干部和各农业社社员有很多丰产田和试验田。玉米亩产一千五百斤丰产试验田的有二千零八十一人，要亩产籽棉一千斤的有一千三百九十五人。参加科学研究工作的有各级领导干部，有老农、劳动模范，也有下放锻炼和特约的西北农学院的教授、讲师和学生。中共醴泉县委副书记孙明才、县长折敬盈等县级负责干部在西北农学院苏献忠副教授帮助下，通过自己的研究试验田，全面负责棉花增产的综合研究，实现百斤皮棉县后写出报告。著名小麦良种“碧蚂一号”培育者赵洪璋教授和劳动模范王保京合作，进行大麦、红薯、玉米、谷子等一年五熟、亩产五千五百斤的套种试验。在与开展群众性的科学研究的同时，这个县还展开了群众性的学习科学技术运动。现在，全县二百八十九个农业社已建立了二百一十六所民办农业技术学校。目前这些技术学校都围绕实现百斤皮棉县的目标，向群众集中教授棉花作务技术。通过这八千多名学员，再向十五万社员传授和指导植棉的各种先进技术。这种群众性科学技术的学习运动，给进行科学研究提供了有利条件。
