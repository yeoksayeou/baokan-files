    Our Good Example
    After the Awakening of Insects comes Pure Brightness, Team Nine used to be terrible, the production progress lagged behind, and labor attendance was not to be discussed.
    Speaking of the unity of the cadres, they talked about others instead of themselves, what was the result? The entire team's production decreased by several tens of percent.
    Since the propaganda of the Great Leap Forward, the cadres of Team Nine have expressed their determination, to get grain we must work in the fields, to be happy we must have more attendance.
    Mobilizing the masses has many tricks, adhering to the Party's principles, good commune members are praised, and bad commune members are debated.
    Professional teams are assigned leadership, and small-section operations follow, all work is leaping forward, and production progress is renewed daily.
    Through several rounds of comparison, many projects are advanced, they have not relaxed, leaping forward again after the leap forward.
    A production team like this is our good example, I hope everyone works hard to surpass Team Nine and become advanced.

### 我们的好榜样

    我们的好榜样
    惊蛰过了是清明，九队以前太不行，生产进度落在后，劳动出勤谈不成。
    谈到干部的团结，不讲自己谈别人，闹到结果是哪样？全队减产好几成。
    自从宣传大跃进，九队干部表决心，要吃粮食田中要，要想幸福多出勤。
    发动群众名堂多，坚持党的原则性，好的社员就表扬，坏的社员就辩论。
    专业小组分领导，小段作业随后跟，各项工作都跃进，生产进度日日新。
    通过几次的评比，很多项目都先进，他们没有松过气，跃进以后又跃进。
    像这样的生产队，是我们的好榜样，希望大家拚命干，超过九队当先进。
