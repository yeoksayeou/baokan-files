    How Great is the Construction Power of a County?

    Following the trial run of the small railway built by Meng County in Shanxi Province, the small railways built by Weiyuan County and Zhangye County in Gansu Province have also opened to traffic. Gansu Province has also decided to mobilize the strength of various counties, relying on the masses, to build 10,000 kilometers of small and medium-sized railways in the next three years. This is a major pioneering undertaking in China's railway construction.

    This kind of railway can be called a simple railway. In terms of railway technology, it is certainly not advanced, but in China's current specific situation, it is a noteworthy and advanced experience.

    Like other construction endeavors in our country, in order to fundamentally carry out technical transformation and greatly develop social productive forces, the construction of railways must adopt the latest technological achievements in the world as much as possible (for example, railway electrification, automatic block systems, diesel locomotives, etc.), and must develop a modern railway network at the fastest speed. However, these latest technological achievements and modern railway networks cannot be immediately popularized in every corner of the country; and the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the country urgently requires transportation to keep up in a timely manner, otherwise it may affect the rapid development of production. In this case, it is of great urgency and practical significance to build small railways that are both economical and can quickly yield results while building a modern railway network. Taking Weiyuan County in Gansu Province as an example, due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the yield per mu of grain has increased from 210 jin to 500 jin this year, and the output value of local industry has risen from less than 10 million yuan to 80 million yuan, more than doubling the total agricultural output value in one year. In this way, the 14 kinds of materials that need to be circulated throughout the county, such as grain, fertilizer, fuel, agricultural tools, industrial products, daily necessities, and various raw materials, amount to approximately 1.24 billion jin, which is twice the volume of transportation last year. If trucks are used, 100 trucks with a load capacity of 4 tons are needed to transport continuously for more than 1,500 days. If animal-drawn carts are used, 10,000 carts with a load capacity of 400 jin are needed to transport uninterruptedly for more than 300 days. If people carry them on their backs, shoulders, or animals, it is impossible to complete the transportation task at all. Weiyuan County cannot immediately obtain a large number of cars, nor does it have so many animal-drawn carts, let alone so much manpower and animal power. In this way, a contradiction arose between the rapid development of production and the backward transportation conditions. Weiyuan County vigorously built small railways and proposed a plan to realize the railway transportation of the entire county within two years in order to solve this contradiction.

    From the successful facts of Meng County in Shanxi and Weiyuan and Zhangye counties in Gansu building their own small railways, and from the plan of Gansu Province to build 10,000 kilometers of simple railways in the next three years, people should understand one question: How great is the construction power of a county? For many people, a correct estimate needs to be made.

    Although simple railways are simple, they are still railways, and they are projects that are quite difficult to build. Whether a country can build its own railways and how many railways it has is not simply a question of whether the railway industry is developed, but also a question of the strength of the entire country's construction power. Whether a county can build its own railways is also a test of the county's construction power. China has more than 2,000 counties, but most of these counties had no industry in the past. The county's fiscal revenue and technical strength are also limited. Therefore, in the impression of many people, the county's construction power is always small, and relying on the county's construction power, "not much can be done." When Weiyuan County was brewing the idea of building a small railway, some people said: "This is overestimating our abilities." Now that the small railway has been built, the facts are in front of us, proving that the county's construction power is very considerable; ignoring this construction power or underestimating it is not conducive to socialist construction.

    Meng County and Weiyuan, Zhangye and other counties were originally industrially backward areas. Why do they have such a strong construction power to build railways themselves? Where does their construction power come from? The most important thing is that their thinking has been liberated, and they rely on the masses and are good at giving play to the subjective initiative of the people. In the construction of the Meng County simple railway, the major problems of casting rails and refitting small locomotives were not solved by first-class modern enterprises, but by an iron processing factory that had just been formed by the union of handicraft production cooperatives. The entire roadbed, sleepers and track laying work completed in a few days was not done by construction experts, but by more than two hundred ordinary people who were temporarily organized. When the doubters did not believe in the power of the masses, the Weiyuan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China handed over the matter of building the railway to the masses for debate, and the result was that the vast majority of people agreed. The farmers said: "We guarantee success, railways, well, if you have iron it will work." So everyone came up with ideas, used scrap iron to cast rails, made spikes by hand, and collected various kinds of wood to make sleepers. It took only twenty days to build a five-kilometer railway. It can be seen that when the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are mobilized and organized, the power is endless. Even if it is a county with very limited financial, material, and technical strength, it can generate strong construction power to complete relatively complex projects such as building railways. Some people say that this is a miracle, we say, it is a miracle, but it is not a miracle. It is a miracle because no county has ever built a railway by itself in history; it is not a miracle because as long as we believe in the masses and mobilize the power of the masses, other counties can do it too.

    Unfortunately, the powerful construction power of the county has not been seen by everyone. Despite the continuous appearance of "miracles" such as counties running railways and counties building blast furnaces, some counties still lack confidence in their own construction power and have a sense of inferiority. Their eyes are always on the top and on the outside, but they cannot see their own strength. Our editorial department has received many letters from readers in product sales departments, complaining about their distress of being "surrounded" by purchasing agents. A comrade from the Sales Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building wrote: We receive dozens of people every day who want machines, and the office is full every day. Among these people who want machines, there are county party committee cadres, cooperative directors, production experts on the agricultural front, production team leaders, and cadres sent down from the central government. Their determination is very great. Some said: "I will not go back if I can't buy a machine," and some said: "I can lose my head, I can shed blood, but I will not give up if I can't get a machine." This spirit is commendable, but since the mechanical industry in large cities cannot immediately meet all the requirements of various parts of the country, some people have traveled all over the major industrial cities in the country, but still have not bought a machine. This reader suggests that all localities should "not rush around, but actively implement the method of obtaining materials locally and processing them locally."

    The reader's suggestion is correct. Of course, the higher levels have a responsibility to help the lower levels, and brother regions should also support each other. Any form of bureaucracy or departmentalism must be resolutely opposed. Some counties' important equipment for industry does need to be supplied by large industries. However, the construction of each county still mainly relies on its own strength. Why are some counties busy "rushing around" and even running into all the major industrial cities in the country? The main reason is that they only see the strength of the higher levels and the strength of others, but they do not see their own strength and the strength of the masses. The "miracle" of the successful self-built railways in Meng County and Weiyuan and Zhangye counties is a good inspiration for these comrades: Why do these counties have such a great construction power to build railways themselves, but they do not have the power to manufacture some ordinary machines and produce some ordinary farm implements? Is it really that there is no such power, or is it that this power has not been mobilized and organized? The facts tell us that as long as we liberate our minds, dare to think and dare to act, and as long as we rely on the masses and give play to the endless wisdom and creativity of the masses, many of the difficulties in the great leap forward of local industries in various counties can be completely solved. This can be illustrated by the "miracle" of Gansu building small railways, and many other "miracles" can also illustrate this. The key to the problem is to exert full effort and strive for the top, and mobilize and organize the strength of the masses.

### 县的建设力量究竟有多大

    县的建设力量究竟有多大
    在山西省盂县自办的小铁路试车之后，甘肃省渭源县和张掖县自办的小铁路也已通车。甘肃省并决定在今后三年内依靠群众动员各县的力量自建一万公里的中小型铁路。这是我国铁路建设事业中一项重大的创举。
    这种铁路，可以叫做简易铁路。在铁路技术上当然不是先进的，但在我国目前的具体情况下，却是一项值得注意的先进经验。
    和我国的其它建设事业一样，为了从根本上进行技术改造，大大发展社会生产力，铁路的建设也必须尽可能采用世界上最新的技术成就
  （例如，铁路的电气化、自动闭塞、内燃机车等等），必须用最快的速度来发展现代化的铁路网。然而，这种最新的技术成就、现代化的铁路网，还不可能马上普及到全国每一个角落；而全国工农业生产大跃进的新形势，又迫切要求运输工作能及时跟上来，否则就可能影响生产的迅速发展。在这种情况下，和兴建现代化铁路网的同时，举办既经济又能迅速收效的小型铁路，就有十分迫切和现实的意义了。以甘肃省渭源县为例，由于工业和农业生产的大跃进，今年粮食亩产量由二百一十斤提高到五百斤，地方工业产值由不足千万元上升至八千万元，一年即超过农业总产值一倍多。这样，全县需要流动的十四种物资，如粮食、肥料、燃料、农具、工业产品、生活用品、各种原料等，约十二亿四千万斤，等于去年运量的两倍。如果用汽车，需要载重四吨的卡车一百辆，连续运送一千五百多天。如用兽力车，需要载重四百斤的车一万辆，不间断地运输三百多天。如果用人背、肩挑、牲口驮，根本无法完成运输任务。渭源县还不可能立即取得大批汽车，也没有那样多的兽力车，更没有那样多的人力、畜力。这样，生产迅速发展和落后的交通运输状况之间，发生了矛盾。渭源县大办小型铁路，提出了全县两年内运输铁路化的规划，就是为了解决这个矛盾。
    从山西盂县和甘肃渭源、张掖两县自办小铁路成功的事实中，从甘肃省决定今后三年内建设一万公里简易铁路的计划中，人们应该懂得一个问题：究竟一个县的建设力量有多大？这对于许多人说来，是需要做一番正确的估计的。
    简易铁路虽说简易，但毕竟是一条铁路，是一桩办起来颇不容易的工程。一个国家能不能自己建设铁路，有多少铁路，并不单纯是一个铁路事业是否发达的问题，而且是整个国家建设力量强弱的问题。一个县能不能自己建设铁路，也是对这个县的建设力量的考验。我国有二千多个县，但这些县大多数过去没有工业。县的财政收入和技术力量也是有限的。因而，在许多人的印象中，县的建设力量总是微小的，依靠县的建设力量，“办不了多少事情”。渭源县在酝酿办小铁路时就有人说：“这是太不量力了。”现在，小铁路建成了，事实摆在面前，证明了县的建设力量非常可观；忽视这种建设力量，或对它作过低的估计，都是不利于社会主义建设的。
    盂县和渭源、张掖等县原来都是工业很落后的地区。为什么他们有这样强大的建设力量能够自己办铁路呢？他们的建设力量从何而来呢？最主要的是他们的思想解放了，是他们依靠群众、善于发挥人民群众的主观能动性。在盂县简易铁路的建设中，解决了浇铸铁轨和改装小火车头等重大问题的，不是什么第一流的现代化企业，而是一个刚由手工业生产合作社联合组成的铁业加工厂。在几天时间内完成全部路基、枕木和铺轨工程的，也不是什么施工专家，而是二百多个临时被组织起来的普普通通的人。当怀疑派不相信群众力量的时候，中共渭源县委把办铁路的事交给群众辩论，结果绝大多数人都同意。农民们表示：“保险办成，铁路吗，有铁就成。”于是大家想办法，用废铁铸造铁轨，用手工打道钉，搜集各种木材做枕木，只用了二十天的时间，就修成了一条五公里的铁路。可见当群众的积极性、创造性被发动起来组织起来以后，力量是无穷无尽的，尽管是一个财力、物力和技术力量都很有限的县，一样可以产生强大的建设力量，来完成像办铁路这样比较复杂的工程。有人说，这是奇迹，我们说，是奇迹，也不是奇迹。是奇迹，因为历史上确实没有一个县自己办过铁路；不是奇迹，因为只要相信群众和发动群众的力量，别的县也能做到。
    遗憾的是，县的这种强大的建设力量，并不是人人都看到了的。尽管县办铁路，县建高炉等“奇迹”不断出现，仍然有一些县对自己的建设力量缺乏信心，抱有自卑感。他们的眼睛总是向着上面、向着外面，而看不见自己的力量。我们的编辑部曾收到许多产品销售部门的读者来信，诉说他们被采购员“包围”的苦恼。第一机械工业部销售局的一位同志来信说：我们每天接待要机器的人几十个，每天办公室都是满满的。在这些要机器的人们当中，有县委干部、合作社主任、农业战线上的生产能手、生产队长、中央下放干部。他们的决心都很大。有的说：“买不到机器不回去”，有的说：“头可断，血可流，搞不到机器不罢休”。这种精神固然可嘉，但由于大城市的机械工业一下还无法满足全国各地的所有要求，结果有些人跑遍全国各大工业城市，还是没有买到机器。这位读者建议各地今后“不要到处乱闯，应积极贯彻就地取材、就地加工的办法”。
    读者的这个建议是正确的。固然，上级有责任来帮助下级，兄弟地区之间也应该互相支援。任何官僚主义、本位主义都是要坚决反对的。有些县工业的重要装备，也的确需要大工业供给。但是各个县的建设，毕竟主要还是依靠自己的力量。为什么有些县忙于“到处乱闯”，甚至撞遍全国各大工业城市呢？最主要的原因是，他们只看到上级的力量，别人的力量，而没有看到自己的力量、群众的力量。盂县和渭源、张掖县自办铁路成功的“奇迹”，对这些同志是一个很好的启发：为什么这几个县有这么大的建设力量能够自办铁路，而自己就没有力量制造一些普通的机器、生产一些普通的农具呢？是果真没有这种力量，还是没有把这种力量动员出来组织起来呢？事实告诉我们，只要解放思想、敢想敢干，只要依靠群众，发挥群众无穷的智慧和创造力，各县地方工业大跃进中的许多困难就完全可以解决。这一点，甘肃办小铁路的“奇迹”可以说明，许许多多其它“奇迹”也可以说明。而问题的关键在于鼓足干劲、力争上游，把群众的力量动员出来、组织起来。
