Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th June. Tianjin is rapidly developing in the direction of manufacturing advanced, precision, and large-scale products.

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line for Socialist Construction, Tianjin's industry has put forward new tasks and new problems. On the one hand, heavy industry, especially the electromechanical industry, needs to develop rapidly to support the country's economic construction; on the other hand, after the production of some simple light industrial products is taken over by the inland areas, some of Tianjin's light industries must undergo technological transformation to process and manufacture various high-end products, and at the same time help inland industries technically. To adapt to the new tasks, Tianjin has decided to build and expand 450 factories starting this year, with an investment amount 65% higher than the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. Currently, the basic construction of more than 150 factories has already started.

This year, the proportion of investment in Tianjin's industrial capital construction used to develop advanced and precision products is the largest, accounting for more than 70%. Based on the characteristics of Tianjin as a comprehensive industrial base, the allocation of this investment covers all major industries; and among the major industries, factories with better equipment and technology are prioritized. The aim is to develop these factories into "leading factories" in various industries through new construction and expansion, so as to drive the production of various industries to gradually shift to a new technological basis. In the electromechanical industry, internal combustion engines, machine tools, electronic instruments, and other systems will see greater development this year. The "leading factories" such as tractor factories, power machinery factories, electric motor factories, construction machinery factories, forging machine tools, watches, and electronic instruments have already started construction and expansion. The technology of these factories is relatively complex. The electronic instrument factory and watch factory under construction, when completed, can produce 240,000 seventeen-jewel watches and more than 6,000 sets of various ultrasonic instruments and resistance strain gauges per year, which will strongly promote the development of Tianjin's instrument and meter industry. In the chemical industry, the Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory, which is being expanded to utilize abundant seawater and salt field resources, started its first phase of construction at the end of May. The expansion task of this factory is to add a combined production system of ammonium chloride and soda ash. It is estimated that after completion next year, it can produce 160,000 tons of ammonium chloride and soda ash each year. With the development of the electromechanical and chemical industries, the demand for steel has greatly increased. Currently, Tianjin's two steel plants have started expansion. In addition, it was also decided this year to build a number of factories manufacturing high-end products such as alloy steel, seamless steel pipes, and prestressed steel wires.

In order to achieve a reasonable division of labor with inland industries, light industry has also begun to focus on developing high-end paper, industrial enamel products, photographic equipment, medical devices, and aquatic product processing. China's first modern cellophane factory will be completed this year, with an annual output of 1,400 tons, which can basically meet the current needs of the country. High-end paper such as copperplate and photographic paper, which has always relied on imports, will also begin production this year. In the textile industry, the projects currently under construction include a cashmere factory and an industrial felt factory.

Tianjin also invested a small amount this year to build a number of factories and workshops for research and experimentation of emerging industries, to prepare for future large-scale development. These factories mainly focus on organic synthesis, plastics, glass fiber, antibiotics, vinylon, calcium carbide, and synthetic rubber.

Technical transformation of existing enterprises is also a key focus of this year's capital construction investment. The transformation of these enterprises is to make full use of the existing factory buildings, add key equipment, adopt new technologies, and improve technology to increase output and quality. In the city's electromechanical industry, it is planned to replace more than 800 new-style machine tools this year, and many old machine tools will be transformed.

　　天津大建工厂　发展高级产品
    新华社天津9日电　天津市正在迅速朝着制造高级、精密、大型产品的方向发展。
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，天津工业提出了新的任务和新的问题。即一方面是重工业，尤其是机电工业需要急速发展，以支援全国的经济建设；另一方面是部分简易的轻工业产品由内地生产后，天津的一些轻工业必须实行技术改造，以便加工制造各种高级产品，同时在技术方面帮助内地工业。为了适应新任务，天津市从今年开始决定新建和扩建四百五十个工厂，这些工厂投资额比第一个五年计划期间总投资额还多了65％。目前，有一百五十多个工厂的基本建设工程已经动工。
    今年天津工业基本建设投资中，用于发展高级、精密产品的比重最大，占70％以上。根据天津市综合性工业基地的特点，这部分投资的分配遍及到各主要行业；而在各主要行业中，又以设备和技术较好的工厂为重点。目的是通过新建和扩建，使这些工厂发展成为各行业的“排头厂”，以便带动各行业的生产逐步转移到新的技术基础上。在机电工业中，内燃机、工作母机、电子仪表等系统今年都有较大的发展。目前已开始动工新建和扩建的有拖拉机厂、动力机厂、电动机厂、工程机械厂、锻压机床、手表、电子仪表等“排头厂”。这些工厂的产品技术都比较复杂。正在建设中的电子仪表厂、手表厂，建成后可以年产十七钻手表二十四万支，各种超声波仪器和电阻应变仪六千多台，将有力地促进天津仪器仪表工业的发展。在化学工业中，为利用丰富的海水和盐田资源而扩建的永利久大沽厂，已在5月底开始了第一期工程。这个工厂的扩建任务是增建氯化氨和纯碱联合生产系统。预计明年建成后可年产氯化氨和纯碱各十六万吨。随着机电、化学工业的发展，对钢铁的需要量大大增加。目前天津的两个炼钢厂都已动工扩建。此外，今年还决定新建一批制造合金钢、无缝钢管、预应力钢丝等高级产品的工厂。
    轻工业为了与内地工业合理分工，也开始以高级纸张、工业搪瓷制品、摄影器材、医疗器械，水产加工等作为发展的重点。我国第一座现代化玻璃纸厂今年即可建成，年产量达一千四百吨，可以基本上满足国家目前的需要。一向依靠进口的铜板、胶板等高级纸张，也都将在今年开始生产。在纺织工业中，目前已动工兴建的项目有山羊绒厂和工业用呢厂。
    天津今年还以少量投资建设了一批研究、试验新兴工业的工厂和车间，为今后的大发展进行技术准备工作。这些工厂主要的是有机合成、塑料、玻璃纤维、抗生素、维尼龙、电石、合成橡胶等。
    原有企业的技术改造，也是今年基本建设投资的一个重点。这些企业的改造是尽量利用原有的厂房建筑，增添关键性设备，采用新工艺，提高技术，提高产量和质量。在全市的机电工业中，今年计划更换新式机床八百多台，还有许多旧机床要改造。
