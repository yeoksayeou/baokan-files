　　Teaching Must Be Combined with Production and Linked to Reality
    Xi'an Jiaotong University: Over 900 Teachers Engage in Heated Debate

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 5th. Over the past twenty days, more than nine hundred teachers at Xi'an Jiaotong University have engaged in a heated debate on whether teaching and scientific research should be combined with production and whether theory should be linked to practice.

During the debate, some teachers believed that emphasizing the combination of teaching and scientific research with production at present would only benefit local industries, and the gains would not be worth the losses in terms of improving teaching quality and scientific research levels. The reasoning was that helping business departments with design and engaging in production at the school were mostly tedious and simple labor, which could not meet the requirements of teaching and scientific research at all, let alone close the gap in science and technology to reach international advanced levels within fifteen years.

However, most teachers refuted this view. The director of the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group said: This semester, we accepted forty-six tasks commissioned by factories, and now we have completed 70%. In this way, we not only helped local industries solve some key problems and contributed to the great work of bringing industrial products up to international standards, but also greatly helped improve teaching and scientific research. He said: Xinhua Metal Products Factory made high-speed cutting tools with hardness exceeding British and American levels based on our analysis results. We are studying the problem of improving the quality of stamping dies for the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. After new steel molds are made in the future, this factory will be able to catch up with international advanced levels in many ways.

On the issue of linking theory with practice, some teachers believe that requiring theory to be linked with practice means ignoring theory. They said that practical knowledge is easy to learn. As long as you compile a textbook, students can understand it by themselves. He Jiawen and Gu Chencheng, teachers of the Metallography Teaching and Research Group, jointly stated that theory is the "arrow" and practice is the "target." Students obtain the "arrow" at school, so that they have a "target" to shoot at when they go to work. The task of teachers is to teach students a large number of "arrows." As for the skills of shooting the "target," students have to master them in their future practical work. They advocated that teachers in universities must carefully translate books, saying that this is the only way to catch up with international scientific levels faster. Teacher Tao Zhong's speech powerfully criticized this view. He said that this dogmatic view completely forgets where theory comes from and wrongly believes that knowledge in books can solve everything. He cited the example of a professor who talked eloquently about the functions of the "one-six-one-six" lathe, but when adjusting the lathe, he pulled the lathe belt outwards and started the machine without lubricating it.

This debate has made some teachers realize that the separation of theory from practice is a key issue that causes a decline in teaching quality.

### 教学要结合生产联系实际  西安交通大学九百多教师热烈辩论

　　教学要结合生产联系实际
    西安交通大学九百多教师热烈辩论
    据新华社西安5日电　西安交通大学九百多名教师二十多天来就教学和科学研究是否需要结合生产、理论是否需要联系实际的问题，展开了一场热烈的辩论。
    辩论中有一部分教师认为，目前强调教学和科学研究结合生产，只对地方工业有利，而对提高教学质量和科学研究水平得不偿失。理由是：帮助业务部门设计和在学校搞生产，多半是些繁琐的简单劳动，根本不能满足教学和科学研究的要求，同科学技术要在十五年赶上国际先进水平的距离更远。
    但是，大部分教师批驳了这种看法。化学教研组主任说：这学期我们接受了工厂委托的四十六项任务，现在已完成了70％。这样我们不但帮助地方工业解决了一些关键问题，在工业产品赶上国际水平的伟大工作中贡献了一分力量，对提高教学和科学研究也有不少帮助。他说：新华金属制品厂制成硬度超过英美水平的高速切削刀，就是根据我们分析结果制成的。西安人民搪瓷厂提高冲模质量的问题，我们正在研究，将来制成新钢模后，这个厂就能从多方面赶上国际先进水平。
    在理论联系实际的问题上，有的教师认为，要求理论联系实际就是忽视理论。他们说，实际知识容易学，只要编一本讲义，学生自己就可以看懂。金相教研组教师何家雯和顾沉澄联合发言说，理论是“矢”，实际是“的”，学生在学校中取得了“矢”，将来到工作岗位上才有“的”可射。教师的任务就是把大量的“矢”教给学生，至于射“的”的技巧是要学生在今后的实际工作中去掌握了。他们主张高等学校的教师必须认真译书，说这样才能更快地赶上国际科学水平。教师陶钟的发言有力地批判了这种观点。他说，这种教条主义的观点是根本忘掉了理论是从什么地方来的。错误地认为书本上知识就能解决一切。他举出有位教授在讲“一六一六”车床功能时，头头是道，但调整机床时，却把车床皮带向外拉，机床不上滑润油就开车。
    这场辩论，已经使一些教师认识到，理论脱离实际是使教学质量下降的关键问题。
