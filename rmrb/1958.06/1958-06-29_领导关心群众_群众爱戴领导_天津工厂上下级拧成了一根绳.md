Leaders Care for the Masses; the Masses Love and Support the Leaders.
Tianjin Factory Upper and Lower Levels Twisted into One Rope

(Our Dispatch) Our correspondent Yin Chongjing reports: Leaders being solicitous about the lives and thoughts of workers is a new phenomenon that has emerged in many factories in Tianjin after the rectification campaign. In these factories, a truly equal and comradely relationship has been established between leaders and the masses.

The vast majority of leading cadres, when working alongside workers and eating and living with them, can proactively engage with the masses, understand and help them solve problems in their lives and thoughts, thereby promoting production. Du Wengui, an electrician in the assembly and riveting workshop of the Tianjin Engineering Machinery Factory, had consistently failed to complete his production tasks well. In the past, the leadership often inspected him from the perspective of production itself, but could never find the reason. After the leading cadres of the workshop participated in labor, they found that Du Wengui was not focused during production. One morning, as soon as he came to work, he sat there dozing off. Zhao Xiushan, the head of the Party branch who worked with him, learned after talking with him that his home was more than twenty miles away from the factory, and he had financial difficulties and could not afford a bus ticket. Every day, he had to get up at four o'clock in the morning and walk to the factory, so he was mentally exhausted. Later, they visited Du Wengui's home and found that his financial situation was not very difficult. The main reason was that Du's wife did not know how to manage the household and had monthly deficits. Therefore, the chairman of the trade union explained to her the principles of diligence and thrift in managing the household and helped her to formulate a household plan. She was also given a subsidy of forty yuan to pay off old debts. Since then, Du Wengui's enthusiasm has been enhanced, and the production situation has completely improved. Shi Zhifu, the deputy director of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, lived in the collective dormitory of Class C. One night, when he talked with the worker Li Dangchen, he learned that he was going to divorce his wife. Subsequently, he contacted the agricultural production cooperative where his wife worked in the name of the factory. A few days later, his wife came to the factory with a letter from the cooperative. From the cooperative's certificate, it was known that his wife was very active in production and behaved very well. The reason why Li Dangchen wanted to file for divorce was mainly based on suspicion. Afterwards, the person in charge of the Party branch of the factory talked with them separately or together four times, focusing on helping, criticizing, and educating Li Dangchen. After Li Dangchen's thinking was clarified, he settled down to production.

In order to meticulously understand the lives and thoughts of the workers, some factory leaders also went deep into the workers' families to conduct general visits. The No. 2 Vegetable Oil Factory is a medium-sized factory. Factory director Fang Lanchun visited all 199 worker households from the Spring Festival to the "May 1st" Labor Day, using holidays and evening rest time. During the visits, he found that 34 households had different problems, including financial difficulties, family members' illnesses, family disputes, housing problems, marriage problems, and so on. After Fang Lanchun and the Party branch and trade union jointly studied the matter, all but one housing problem had been resolved. Bao Quan, a worker named Yu Jintang, was injured at work last year, his right leg was crushed, and he had been in the hospital and sanatorium for more than half a year. Because there was no one to help at home, the house was broken and no one repaired it. After Fang Lanchun found out about this situation during a visit, he used a Sunday to take more than ten workers with the Party branch secretary to Yu Jintang's home to help repair it. Yu Jintang's mother said to the residents in the same courtyard with emotion: "This is our workers' factory director."

The leading comrades of some factories have also conducted a systematic review of the ideological problems of all workers in order to systematically analyze and study them and help them solve them. For example, in April, the Jushengyuan Zipper Factory conducted a review of the ideology of all 85 workers in the factory, comprehensively studied who had improved their ideological awareness after the double-anti movement, who still had problems, and found universal ideological problems from them, and launched a socialist education movement in the factory. In this movement, Party and government leaders, as ordinary workers, exchanged hearts and "opened their hearts" with all the workers. As a result, the ideological awareness of all the workers in the factory has taken another step forward. The number of originally ideologically advanced workers has increased from ten to thirty-five, and the number of ideologically backward workers has also decreased from twenty-three to two. The young female worker Hu Zhimei was paid on a piece-rate basis. She could get 2.7 cents for each foot of zipper plate she arranged. Therefore, she focused all her attention on output. She could arrange 100 feet a day and did not consider quality at all. She often had more than ten broken plates a day. She said that her goal was to "strive for 2.7 cents, and I don't care about the national plan." In the movement, in addition to the help of all the workers in the factory, the Party and Youth League branch secretaries and the chairman of the trade union also talked with her more than ten times. Now, Hu Zhimei has made a leap-forward plan. Since the "May 4th" Youth Day, she has not produced a single broken plate.

Li Shuliang, the director of the No. 2 Knitting Factory, found that the production plan of the third workshop in early May was not well completed, but he could not find the reason. He then went to the workshop and held discussions with workers from two groups. The workers very naturally told the factory director what was on their minds: We are worried that the leaders have already increased the production task by 10% this month. If we complete it, we may have to increase our quota next month. After the factory director understood this situation, he personally explained it to all the workers in the workshop and carried out ideological education for them. The workers' production enthusiasm immediately soared, and they were able to complete the plan every day.

### 领导关心群众　群众爱戴领导  天津工厂上下级拧成了一根绳

    领导关心群众　群众爱戴领导
    天津工厂上下级拧成了一根绳
    本报讯　记者尹崇敬报道：领导人无微不至地关心职工的生活和思想，这是天津市许多工厂在整风以后出现的新气象。在这些工厂里，领导和群众之间真正建立了平等的同志式的关系。
    绝大多数领导干部在跟班劳动和工人同吃同住时，都能主动和群众接触，了解并帮助他们解决生活和思想上的问题，从而推动了生产。天津工程机械厂装铆车间电工杜文贵，对生产任务一直完成得不好，过去领导上经常从生产本身进行检查，但始终找不出原因。车间领导干部参加劳动以后，发现杜文贵生产时精神不集中，有一次早晨刚上班，他便坐在那儿打盹。和他一起劳动的党支部负责人赵秀山，和他谈心后，才知道他的家离工厂二十多里路，而且经济困难，买不起车票，每天都是四点多钟起床走路来厂上班，因而精神疲乏。后来，又到杜文贵家去访问，发现他的经济情况并不十分困难，主要是杜的妻子不会管理家务，每月都有亏欠。于是，工会主席就给她讲解勤俭持家的道理，并帮助她订了一个持家计划。还给她补助了四十元，还清了旧欠。自此，杜文贵的积极性有了提高，生产情况也完全好转了。第二棉织厂副厂长石志甫，住在丙班集体宿舍里。一天晚上，他和工人李当臣谈心时，了解到他要和妻子闹离婚的情况，随后就以工厂的名义和他妻子所在的农业生产合作社取得联系。不几天，他妻子便拿着合作社的信来到厂里。从合作社的证明信上，知道他的妻子生产很积极，行为也很好，李当臣所以要提出离婚，主要是从怀疑出发。以后，这个厂的党支部负责人对他俩分别或一起作了四次谈话，着重帮助、批评和教育了李当臣。李当臣的思想弄通以后，生产也安下心来了。
    为了细致了解职工群众的生活和思想情况，有的工厂领导同志还深入到职工家庭进行普遍访问。第二植物油厂是个中型的厂子，厂长方兰春从春节起到“五一”节止，利用假日和晚上休息时间，对一百九十九户职工家庭已全部访问过一遍。在访问中，他发现有三十四户存在着不同的问题，包括生活困难、家属生病、家庭纠纷以及居住问题、婚姻问题等等。方兰春同志和党支部、工会共同研究后，除有一户的居住问题尚未解决外，其他已全部得到解决。保全工人于金棠去年因工负伤，右腿被压，住医院和疗养院已经大半年。由于家里没有人手，房子坏了也没人修。方兰春同志在访问中发现这一情况后，就利用一个星期天，和党支部书记一块带着十多个职工到于金棠家去帮助修理。于金棠母亲感动得对同院居民说：“这是我们工人的厂长。”
    有的工厂的领导同志，还对全体职工的思想问题进行了排队，以便系统地分析研究，帮助他们解决。如聚盛源拉链厂，在4月份就对全厂八十五个职工的思想进行了排队，全面研究了谁在双反运动以后思想觉悟有了提高，谁还存在问题，并从中找出了普遍的思想问题，在全厂开展了社会主义教育运动。在这一运动中，党政领导人都以普通工人的身份，和全体职工“以心换心”、相互“交心”。结果，全厂职工的思想觉悟又提高了一步，原先思想先进的职工是十人，现在增加到三十五人，思想落后的工人，也从二十三人减到了两人。青年女工胡芝妹是作计件工资，每排一尺拉链的板子可得工资二分七厘，因而她把注意力全放在产量上，每天能排一百尺，根本不考虑质量，一天常常十几次坏板子。她说她的目标是“向二分七奋斗，国家计划我不管”。在运动中，她除了得到全厂工人的帮助外，党、团支部书记和工会主席，还特地同她谈了十几次话。现在，胡芝妹已订出了跃进计划，从“五四”青年节以来，一个坏板子也没有出。
    第二针织厂厂长李树良发现第三车间5月上旬的生产计划完成情况不好，但找不出原因来，随即下车间找了两个小组的工人座谈研究。工人们非常自然地向厂长说出了心里话：我们顾虑这个月领导上已经给增加了10％的生产任务，如果完成了，下月恐怕还得给我们提高定额。厂长弄清楚了这一情况后，就亲自向全车间工人作了解释，并对他们进行思想教育，工人的生产情绪立即高涨起来，每天都能完成计划。
