    Rice Harvesting Boat
    The counties of Haicheng in Fujian are widely promoting a summer harvest tool called the "rice harvesting boat," which can prevent grain loss, ensure that all grains are brought home, and improve harvesting efficiency. By promoting this tool, the county can avoid a loss of 3.2 million catties from its 160,000 mu of early rice.
    The rice harvesting boat was successfully modified by cadres of the Liming Cooperative from a rice planting boat. This tool can be used for both planting and harvesting. It has three major advantages for harvesting: First, it avoids losses from dropped grains and ears, reducing losses by about 20 catties per mu; second, the rice harvesting boat can be used to transport rice, increasing efficiency by two times compared to manual carrying; third, it prevents the rice from getting wet and sprouting, and it can shorten the time for drying the grain. The Haicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this tool has universal value for promotion and has decided to rush-produce 15,000 boats before the summer harvest, so that most of the rice paddies can use this tool. The above picture shows members of the Liming Cooperative harvesting early rice with rice harvesting boats. (Picture attached)

    割稻船
    福建海澄各乡正在普遍推广一种能够避免稻子落粒，确保颗粒还家和提高收割效率的夏收农具——割稻船。该县通过推广这一农具后，全县十六万亩早稻，就可以避免落粒损失三百二十万斤。
    割稻船是海澄黎明社干部把插秧船改制成功的，这种农具可作插秧、收割两用。用以收割有三大好处：一、避免落粒掉穗的损失，每亩可以减少损失二十斤左右；二、割稻船可以用来运稻子，比过去用人力挑稻提高效率二倍；三、避免稻子沾水发芽并能缩短晒谷时间。中共海澄县委认为这一农具有普遍推广价值，决定在夏收前赶制一万五千只，做到在大部分的稻田使用这一农具。上图是黎明社社员带着割稻船在收割早稻。（附图片）
