　　Opening a Hundred Interconnected Wells and Leading Underground Water Up the Mountain
　　Zhuangziping Cooperative Sets an Example for Utilizing Underground Water on the Plateau
　　(Our Dispatch) The members of the Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County, Gansu Province, after experiencing multiple failures and setbacks, have successfully opened a hundred interconnected wells, forming an underground channel, setting a new example for utilizing underground water resources in the arid and rain-scarce Loess Plateau region. Now, the cooperative members are full of energy, advancing on all fronts, to further move the underground water up the high mountains.
　　These interconnected wells are located in the Gongba River area with sloping terrain. The cooperative members dug ninety-six wells on the upper end of the slope, using each as a starting point, and dug culverts to connect them into an underground channel. The underground channel is divided into five branches, which are finally combined into an open channel, with a total length of more than 1,600 meters. The current water flow is 0.017 cubic meters per second, and it has irrigated 2,000 mu of land.
　　Interconnected well underground channels have many advantages. By changing water wells into underground channels, it is possible to collect large and small water sources along the channel and increase the water volume. The underground channel allows water to flow below and crops to be planted above, greatly reducing the land occupied by open channels and greatly reducing water evaporation. Now, the experience of interconnected wells has begun to blossom and bear fruit throughout Gaolan County, and there are twelve underground channels under construction, which can develop about 20,000 mu of irrigated land.
　　Zhuangziping is an arid area in the northern mountains of Gaolan. In order to tap underground water, the local people have experienced six rounds of development in 1943, 1946, 1953, spring of 1956, 1957 winter, and now. During the reactionary ruling period, although construction was started twice, it yielded no results due to the oppression of the reactionary classes. In 1953, during a severe drought, construction was started again, but it was not completed due to the large scale of the project and the limitations of the individual economy. In 1956, just after the cooperative movement, the local Party committee led the masses to start construction again, digging an open channel five li long, but because the water volume was small, not even one mu of land was irrigated. After several failures, the local Party committee repeatedly educated and mobilized the masses, reorganized its forces, and summarized the experiences and lessons with the masses, changing the open channel to an underground channel. By the spring of 1957, twelve interconnected wells had been dug, increasing the water volume and turning 470 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Last winter, in coordination with the province's water conservancy upsurge, the slogan of "a hundred interconnected wells" was put forward. In the cold winter months, the cooperative members devoted themselves and persisted in their work for several months, finally completing the underground channel.
　　Moving underground water up the high mountains is the common aspiration of the broad masses in the northern mountains of Gaolan. The underground water in the Yangwayao area is very abundant, but very little has been developed. Therefore, after the "hundred interconnected wells" were basically opened, the members of Zhuangziping immediately began to dig deeper underground channels to continue tapping the second layer of water. In addition, in order to resolve the contradiction and utilize all the underground water, after full deliberation, the two cooperatives of Zhuangziping and Yangwayao formally merged on May 4. As soon as the two cooperatives merged, they put forward a unified goal: to continue to open up underground water sources in Yangwayao, lead the water up the mountain, and develop another 16,000 mu of irrigated land this year. At present, the east main channel for leading water up the mountain has been basically surveyed and construction officially started on May 10; among them, a section of the underground channel that needs to be passed through, thanks to the efforts of the members of the original Yangwayao cooperative last winter and this spring, has been basically opened. The west main channel for leading water up the mountain is also being actively prepared and will be started soon. (Attached picture)

    打通百眼串井  引地下水上山
    庄子坪社树立了高原利用地下水的榜样
    本报讯　甘肃省皋兰县庄子坪农业社社员经历多次失败和挫折，胜利地打通百眼串井，构成一条地下渠道，给干旱少雨的黄土高原地区利用地下水源树立了新的榜样。现在社员们正鼓足干劲，分路进军，要进一步把地下水搬上高山。
    这些串井位于地势倾斜的拱坝川一带。社员们在坡地上端打了九十六眼井，分别作为起点，各打涵洞，连串成为地下渠道。地下渠道共分五支，最后汇总成为明渠。全长一千六百多公尺。现有水流量零点零一七秒公方，已浇灌土地两千亩。
    串井地下渠道好处很多。变水井为地下水渠后，可以汇集沿渠的大小水源，增加水量。暗渠下面流水，上面种田，大大减少开明渠所占用的土地，并且可以大大减少水的蒸发。现在串井经验开始在皋兰全县开花结果，正在兴建的地下渠道共有十二条，可发展水地两万亩左右。
    庄子坪是皋兰北山的干旱地区。为了挖出地下水，当地群众曾经经历过1943年、1946年、1953年、1956年、1957年春天和1957年冬直到现在的六度开发。在反动统治时期，虽经两度动工，因遭反动阶级的压迫，毫无成果。1953年大旱时又动工兴建，因工程浩大，受个体经济的限制，未成。1956年刚刚合作化，当地党委再来领导群众开工，挖开了五里长的一条明渠，因水量小，又没浇上一亩地。经过几次失败，当地党委反复教育动员群众，重整旗鼓，和群众共同总结了经验教训，改修明渠为地下渠，到1957年春季才打成了十二眼串井，增加了水量，使四百七十亩旱地变成了水田。去年冬季，配合全省的水利高潮，又提出了“百眼串井”的口号。在数九寒天，社员们奋不顾身，坚持工作几个月，终于修成了地下渠道。
    把地下水搬上高山，是皋兰北山广大群众的共同愿望。阳坬窑一带的地下水十分丰富，现已开发出来的还很少。因此，庄子坪的社员们在“百眼串井”基本打通后，立即着手深挖地下渠道，要继续打出第二层水来。另外，为了解决矛盾，将全部地下水利用起来，经过充分酝酿，庄子坪和阳坬窑两社已于5月4日正式合并。两社刚一合并，便提出了一致的目标，要在阳坬窑继续大开地下水源，引水上山，在今年再发展水地一万六千亩。现在，引水上山的东干渠已经基本测量完毕，于5月10日正式开始施工；其中，需经的一段地下渠道，在原阳坬窑社社员们去冬今春的努力下，已经基本打通。引水上山的西干渠，也正在积极筹办，不日即可开工。（附图片）
