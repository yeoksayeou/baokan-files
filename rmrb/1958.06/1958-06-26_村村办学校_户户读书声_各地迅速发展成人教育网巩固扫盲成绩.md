Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: A new situation has begun to emerge in the national illiteracy elimination movement: the vast number of working people who have shed the label of illiteracy are now holding high the banner of the cultural revolution, and with the spirit of "to ascend another story, to see a thousand miles further," are further advancing towards the cultural and technological fortress, determined to completely turn themselves over culturally. In the past few months, a large number of spare-time primary schools, middle schools, various technical night schools, and Red and Expert schools have emerged from illiteracy classes and people's schools in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, Zhejiang Province alone has established more than 15,600 agricultural technology night schools. Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces, and some counties in Hebei Province, have opened more than 215,100 spare-time primary and middle schools (classes) for people who have graduated from illiteracy programs. The number of workers and peasants who, after overcoming illiteracy, are participating in various spare-time technical night schools, spare-time primary and middle schools, etc., in the ten provinces and cities of Heilongjiang, Henan, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and forty-six counties in other provinces, totals 18,340,000. From north to south, from the interior to the border regions, from industrial and mining areas to the vast countryside, our motherland presents a moving scene of "cultural outposts everywhere, the sound of reading everywhere."

China is an ancient civilization with a long history, but culture has always been in the hands of a small number of exploiting classes. The working people, who account for the vast majority of the population numbering hundreds of millions, have been deprived of the right to access culture. They "can carry mountains on their shoulders, but their eyes are in complete darkness," resulting in the cultural backwardness of the entire country. Since liberation, the Communist Party has led the people to turn themselves over politically and economically, and also to turn themselves over culturally. In the past few years, more than 30 million working people have been permanently freed from illiteracy through the illiteracy elimination movement. Since the Great Leap Forward last winter, the illiteracy elimination movement has unfolded in various regions with overwhelming momentum. Even during the current busy farming season, 80,082,000 people in twenty-two provinces and cities, including Jiangsu and Henan, are persisting in learning. Due to the strong leadership of the Party committees in various regions, the high enthusiasm of the masses for learning, the diverse teaching methods, and the rapid pace of progress, in the past few months, the six provinces of Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Hunan, Anhui, and Hebei alone, according to incomplete statistics, have seen more than 13 million people shed the label of illiteracy. One province (Heilongjiang) and 222 counties across the country have basically eliminated illiteracy. Inspired by the beautiful vision of communism, the working people are not satisfied with simply being able to read and write, but are determined to further advance towards culture, science, and technology. Heilongjiang Province has vigorously established spare-time schools after eliminating illiteracy; Henan Province is rapidly developing an adult spare-time education network to consolidate the achievements of illiteracy elimination. The rural areas of Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi Province are widely running farmers' spare-time Red and Expert schools; a total of 690,000 workers in Shanghai and Tianjin have graduated from illiteracy programs and are continuing their studies in vocational spare-time schools. In some places, a complete spare-time education system has emerged, from spare-time primary schools to spare-time middle schools and spare-time universities. In the border minority areas, the torrent of the cultural revolution is also surging forward. In some places in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where in the past "only the sounds of cattle and sheep were heard, but not the sound of reading," now "classes have been opened in every village, and the sound of reading is everywhere."

In the working people's advance towards the cultural revolution, they are all closely integrating with production under the leadership of Party organizations. According to the urgent demands of the masses for learning culture, Party committees at all levels in Henan Province have adopted the leadership methods of secretaries taking the lead, the entire Party mobilizing, and "seven unifications" (unified arrangement, deployment, organization, action, inspection, reporting, and summary). Under the guidance of the policy of "combining with the center, serving production, and improving technology," they have launched a mass debate on the relationship between learning culture and developing production, and held oath-taking rallies to march towards culture. Therefore, from the initiation of illiteracy elimination to the transition from the completion of the illiteracy elimination task to the development of adult spare-time education, progress has been rapid and effective. Hubei Province is promoting the experience of Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County, which is "learning culture, innovating technology, and running night schools in every village." According to the demands of the masses, the CPC Simao County Committee of Yunnan Province decided to vigorously run Red and Expert schools in rural areas. A secretary was put in charge, and soon 55 Red and Expert schools were established in 44 agricultural cooperatives and 11 large townships. The branch secretaries and general branch secretaries of the Party served as principals, and in teaching, they closely integrated politics, technology, and culture, which was welcomed by the masses. In order to adapt to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee decided to train approximately 1.2 million workers and peasants as a technical army in the province within five years through various means.

The masses in various regions are enthusiastic, energetic, and determined to reverse the situation of "cultural backwardness" and bring about a cultural transformation and a production leap forward. Peasants in Anhui sing in folk songs: "Culture is a treasure for crops, with culture, one can become skilled." Elderly farmers in Dengfeng County, Henan, also want to learn. They say, "Learn as you grow old, learn until you're old, learn skills until you're a hundred, and wholeheartedly want to learn from the elder Liang Hao." A woman in Shilipu in this county wrote on a couplet on her door: "Borrowing starlight to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, taking advantage of the moonlight to read and write," and the horizontal scroll was: "Eyes Brightened." Based on the working masses of the whole country, a mighty and unstoppable army marching towards culture is growing stronger and stronger, and the curtain of the cultural revolution has been lifted!

    村村办学校　户户读书声
    各地迅速发展成人教育网巩固扫盲成绩
    据新华社25日讯　全国扫盲运动已开始出现一个新的情况：摘掉文盲帽子的广大劳动人民，正高举文化革命的旗帜，以“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”的气概，进一步向文化技术堡垒进军，要在文化上也彻底翻身。几个月来，各地大量出现由扫盲识字班、民校转成的业余小学、中学、各类技术夜校、红专学校等。根据不完全统计，仅浙江一个省所办农业技术夜校就有一万五千六百多所，黑龙江、辽宁两省和河北省部分县为扫盲毕业的人开设的业余小学和中学有二十一万五千一百多所（班）。脱离文盲状态后参加各种业余技术夜校、业余中小学等学习的工人和农民，仅黑龙江、河南、浙江、湖北、安徽、辽宁、河北、山西、上海、天津等十个省、市和另外几省四十六个县，就有一千八百三十四万人。我们祖国，从北到南，从内地到边疆，自工矿区到广大农村，出现了“处处文化岗，处处读书声”的动人情景。
    中国是一个具有悠久历史的文明古国，但文化一向掌握在少数剥削阶级的人手里，占绝大比例为数几亿的劳动人民被剥夺了接触文化的权利，他们“两肩能担山，两眼一片黑”，形成整个国家的文化落后状态。解放以后，共产党领导人民在政治上和经济上翻身，也要在文化上翻身，几年来扫盲运动中已有三千多万劳动人民永远摆脱了文盲状态。去冬以来全国大跃进，扫盲运动更以排山倒海之势在各地展开，即在目前夏忙季节里，在江苏、河南等二十二个省、市即有八千零八十二万人坚持学习。由于各地党的领导强、群众学习劲头大、教学方法多、进展速度快，几个月来仅黑龙江、河南、江苏、湖南、安徽、河北六省不完全统计，即有一千三百多万人脱离文盲状态，全国已有一个省（黑龙江）和二百二十二个县基本上扫除了文盲。劳动人民在美丽的共产主义远景鼓舞下，不满足于睁眼识字，还要进一步向文化和科学技术进军。黑龙江省扫盲之后大办业余学校；河南省迅速发展成人业余教育网，以巩固扫盲的成绩。山西省长治专区的农村，普遍举办农民业余红专学校；上海和天津两个市工人扫盲毕业后进职工业余学校继续学习的共达六十九万人。有的地方并出现了由业余小学到业余中学、业余大学的一套业余教育系统。在边疆少数民族地区，文化革命的洪流也是滚滚向前，广西僮族自治区有些地方过去是“只闻牛羊叫，不闻读书声”，现在则是“屯屯开了班，遍地读书声”了。
    劳动人民向文化革命进军中，都是在党组织领导下密切结合生产进行的。河南省各级党委根据群众对于学文化的迫切要求，采取书记动手、全党动员和“七统一”（统一安排、布置、组织、行动、检查。汇报、总结）的领导方法，在“结合中心，服务生产，提高技术”的方针指导下，发动全民辩论学文化和发展生产的关系，举行向文化进军的誓师大会，因此从发动扫盲到扫盲任务完成后转向发展成人业余教育，都迅速而有效。湖北省正在推广天门县小庙乡“学习文化，革新技术，村村办夜校”的经验。中共云南省思茅县委根据群众要求，决定在农村大办红专学校，由一位书记负责，很快在四十四个农业社和十一个大乡成立五十五所红专学校，都由党的支部书记和总支书记担任校长，在教学中把政治、技术和文化三者密切结合起来，受到群众欢迎。为适应工农业生产大跃进，甘肃省委常委会决定，通过各种办法，五年内在全省培养工农技术大军一百二十万名左右。
    各地群众向文化进军，热情高，劲头大，决心把“文化落后”的状况倒过来，来个文化大翻身、生产大跃进。安徽的农民在歌谣中唱道：“文化是庄稼宝，有了文化就能生巧”。河南登封县老年农民也要学习，他们说：“长到老，学到老，活到一百要学巧，一心要学老梁灏”；这个县十里铺有一个妇女在门联上写道：“借星光积肥送粪，趁月亮读书写字”，横联是：“眼睛亮了”。以全国工农大众为基干，一支浩浩荡荡的向文化进军的队伍越来越壮大，文化革命的序幕已经揭开了！
