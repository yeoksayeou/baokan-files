Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 30th - The Political Committee of the Australian Communist Party recently issued a statement criticizing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The statement pointed out that the propositions put forward in the Yugoslav Communist program are contrary to Marxism-Leninism and only conform to the interests of revisionism.

The statement said that the Yugoslav Communist program disagrees with the profound analysis of the post-war situation made in the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. Incidentally, the Yugoslav Communist representatives refused to sign this declaration on the grounds that it might damage Yugoslavia's international relations – its relations with capitalist countries.

The Yugoslav Communist program and the speeches at the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist also abandoned the peace declaration adopted in Moscow last November, which their representatives supported and signed.

The statement said that it is clear that the danger of war today comes from capitalist countries and from the aggressive policies of monopoly capitalism.

In socialist countries where monopoly capitalism has been eliminated and the working people are in power, there is no class or group keen on war. Socialist countries want to live in a peaceful environment, and they strive to maintain world peace.

The Yugoslav Communist program does not distinguish between the two camps in the world – the socialist peace camp and the imperialist aggression camp. The program mentions "the world is divided into two hostile military-political blocs." Such an assessment is not only wrong but also benefits the warmongers and weakens the struggle for peace.

The statement pointed out that Tito's statement at the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist that "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established because of Stalin's foreign policy" is not a new argument. The U.S. State Department has always said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a "defensive" alliance. But what are the facts? There is no doubt that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established as part of a purposeful aggressive world plan against socialist countries and the national liberation movements of Asia and Africa. The establishment of the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which are linked to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the intervention in Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Middle East – including Lebanon – the stationing of American troops in Europe and Asia, and the support for the Hungarian counter-revolution, all illustrate the aggressive aims of U.S. imperialism and the true purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The statement said that the Communist Parties of all countries have been seriously disturbed by Yugoslavia's military alliance with Greece and Turkey, which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact. The statement pointed out that Tito explained that the military aspect of Yugoslavia's alliance with Greece and Turkey is losing importance, while the economic aspect is becoming more and more important. But the fact remains that this is a military treaty signed with allies of U.S. imperialism. These allies provide bases in their territories for the United States to carry out aggression against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

The statement said that there is a marked contrast in the materials of the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, where sharp criticisms were made of the Soviet Union, while there was almost no criticism of the policies and aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism. The statement pointed out that Tito was particularly satisfied with the relations between the United States and Yugoslavia, which is even stranger in view of the current worldwide wave of anti-American sentiment (for example, in South America, the people's angry reaction to U.S. Vice President Nixon's "friendly" visit; the destruction of U.S. government agencies in Lebanon and the Middle East; the angry anti-American sentiment of the Indonesian people).

The statement expressed disagreement with the Yugoslav Communist's claims about monopoly capital and the state. The statement pointed out that the views put forward in the Yugoslav Communist program say that the state is placing monopoly capital under control, while workers are strengthening their influence on the state. Reformists in Australia and other capitalist countries also hold this view. But this is not in line with the actual situation.

The statement said that the tendency of development in Australia, like all capitalist countries, is that monopoly capital is gradually strengthening its control over the state, and the reactionary forces have also increased. State financial resources are plundered by monopoly capital, and the tax system favors them while placing a heavy burden on all low-income earners. The police are increasingly monitoring working-class organizations, the Communist Party and trade unions are being attacked, strikes are declared illegal and subject to huge fines, and the courts are increasingly interfering in the internal affairs of trade unions.

In the United States, a typical monopoly capitalist country, a congressional leader recently said that police surveillance of the people is now worse than in Hitler's Germany.

The statement said that Lenin's theory that the capitalist state is a tool for monopoly capitalism to suppress the working class has been fully confirmed in our experience.

In Australia, we also have long-term experience with state capitalist enterprises, including railways, tram and bus companies, airlines, banks, power stations, and many other industries. However, we can never say that these developments indicate "we have entered the socialist era." The actual effect of all these state capitalist enterprises is to strengthen Australia's capitalist structure and promote the development of monopoly enterprises.

Indeed, once the regime of monopoly enterprises is broken and the working-class regime is established, the existence of these large state capitalist enterprises will facilitate the reorganization of society. But this is quite different from saying that their existence now means that we have "entered the socialist era."

The statement said that if the Yugoslav Communist's claims about monopoly enterprises and the state are accepted, this will disarm the working class, and ideas about "capitalism collapsing on its own" will grow, and finally, the decisive role of the Communist Party in the socialist transformation will be excluded. Indeed, that is exactly what the Yugoslav Communist Party is trying to do. The statement said that they believe that the movement for socialism in the United States may be led by trade unions. The corruption of the American trade union movement has developed more seriously than in any other country. We believe that the United States needs a strong Communist Party, and then the trade union movement can occupy an appropriate place in the struggle for socialism.

Under the pretext of discussing "different paths to socialism" and opposing "dogmatism," the Yugoslav Communist Party attacked many of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and put forward a thoroughgoing revisionist program. Their revisionist policies will confuse and disarm the working class in capitalist countries and prolong the rule of monopoly enterprises, and it will undermine and weaken the relations between socialist countries.

The statement emphasized that revisionism should be condemned as right-wing opportunism and should be condemned as a manifestation of bourgeois ideology in the working-class movement.

The statement said that when the Communist Parties of various countries criticized the Yugoslav Communist program, the bourgeoisie insisted that a "crisis" had arisen in the world communist movement and in socialist countries. But there is no crisis, and revisionism has been discredited in the Communist Parties of various countries.

　　澳共政治委员会发表声明
    斥南共关于垄断企业和国家的谬论
    世界反美浪潮高涨而铁托却对美国表示满意
    新华社30日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党政治委员会最近发表声明，批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案。
    声明指出，南共纲领所提出的主张是违反马克思列宁主义的，是仅仅符合修正主义的利益的。
    声明说，南共纲领不同意社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言中对战后局势所作出的深刻分析。顺便提一下，南共的代表们不肯在这项宣言上签名，理由是：这可能会破坏南斯拉夫的国际关系——它同资本主义国家的关系。
    南共纲领和在南共第七次代表大会上的发言也背弃了去年11月在莫斯科通过的、他们的代表支持和签了名的和平宣言。
    声明说，显然，今天的战争危险来自资本主义国家，来自垄断资本主义的侵略政策。
    在垄断资本主义已经被消灭而由劳动人民当权的社会主义国家中，没有热中于战争的阶级或集团。社会主义国家希望在和平环境中生活，它们为维护世界和平而努力。
    南共纲领没有把世界上的两个阵营——社会主义和平阵营和帝国主义侵略阵营——区别开来，纲领提到“世界分裂为两个敌对的军事政治集团”。这样一个估计不仅是错误的，而且有利于战争贩子并且会削弱争取和平的斗争。
    声明指出，铁托在南共第七次代表大会上提出的所谓“北大西洋公约组织是由于斯大林的外交政策而成立的”这种说法并不是一种新论点。美国国务院一直说，北大西洋公约组织是一个“防御性”联盟。但是事实是怎样呢？毫无疑问，北大西洋公约组织是作为一项针对社会主义国家和亚非民族解放运动的有目的的侵略性世界计划的一部分而建立的。同北大西洋公约组织联结起来的巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织的成立，对越南、印度尼西亚和中东——包括黎巴嫩在内——的干涉，美国军队驻在欧洲和亚洲，对匈牙利反革命的支持，所有这一切都说明美帝国主义的侵略目的和北大西洋公约组织的真正目的。
    声明说，各国共产党一直感到严重不安的是南斯拉夫同希腊和土耳其保持着军事同盟的联系，而这两个国家是北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约的成员国。声明指出，铁托解释说，南斯拉夫同希腊和土耳其的同盟的军事方面正在失去重要性，而经济方面则变得越来越重要了。但是事实仍然是，这是一个和美帝国主义的盟国签订的军事条约。这些盟国在自己的领土提供基地让美国对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行侵略。
    声明说，在南共第七届代表大会的材料中，对苏联进行了尖锐的批评，而对美帝国主义的政策和侵略活动几乎完全没有批评，这是一个鲜明的对照。声明指出，铁托特别对于美国和南斯拉夫的关系表示满意，鉴于目前世界范围的反美情绪的浪潮（例如：在南美，人民对美国副总统尼克松的“友好”访问的愤怒反应；美国政府设在黎巴嫩和中东的机构被捣毁；印度尼西亚人民的愤怒的反美情绪），这就显得更加奇怪。
    声明表示不同意南共关于垄断资本和国家的说法。声明指出，南共纲领中所提出的观点说，国家正把垄断资本置于控制之下，同时工人正在加强他们对国家的影响。澳大利亚和其他资本主义国家的改良主义者也抱有这种观点。但是这是不符合实际情况的。
    声明说，澳大利亚发展的倾向同所有资本主义国家一样，是垄断资本正在逐渐加强对国家的控制，而且反动势力也增强了。国家财源被垄断资本所劫掠，税收制度偏袒它们而把沉重的负担加到一切低收入者的身上。警察对工人阶级组织的监视日益加剧，共产党和工会受到攻击，罢工被宣布为非法，而且要交纳巨额的罚款，同时法院在变本加厉地干涉工会的内部事务。
    在美国这个典型的垄断资本主义国家里，一个国会领袖最近说，现在警察对人民的侦察比希特勒德国还厉害。
    声明说，列宁的关于资本主义国家是垄断资本主义镇压工人阶级的工具的理论，在我们的经验中完全得到了证实。
    在澳大利亚，我们对国家资本主义企业也有着长期的经验，这些企业包括铁路、电车和公共汽车公司、航空公司、银行、电力站和其他许多工业。但是，我们决不能说这些发展表明“我们进入了社会主义时代”。所有这些国家资本主义企业的实际效果是加强了澳大利亚的资本主义结构和助长了垄断企业的发展。
    的确，一旦垄断企业的政权被打破和工人阶级政权建立起来，这些大的国家资本主义企业的存在将便于社会的改组。但是，这究竟不同于说现在它们的存在意味着我们已经“进入了社会主义时代”。
    声明说，如果接受南共关于垄断企业和国家的说法，这将解除工人阶级的武装、而关于“资本主义自行崩溃”的思想将会滋长，最后就会排斥共产党在社会主义改造中的决定性的作用。的确，南共正是要这样做的。声明说，他们认为在美国可能由工会来领导争取社会主义的运动。美国工会运动的腐化现象比任何其他国家都发展得严重。我们认为，美国需要有一个强大的共产党，然后工会运动才能在争取社会主义的斗争中占有适当的地位。
    南共以讨论“走向社会主义的不同道路”和反对“教条主义”为理由，攻击了许多马克思列宁主义的基本原则，并且提出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领。他们的修正主义政策会使资本主义国家的工人阶级陷于混乱和解除武装，并且使垄断企业的统治长期保持下去，它会破坏和削弱社会主义国家之间的关系。
    声明强调说，修正主义应当被谴责为右倾机会主义，应当被谴责为资产阶级思想在工人阶级运动中的一种表现。
    声明说，当各国共产党对南共纲领进行批判的时候，资产阶级硬说，在世界共产主义运动中和在社会主义国家中产生了“危机”。但是危机并不存在，修正主义在各国共产党内已经是声名狼籍了。
