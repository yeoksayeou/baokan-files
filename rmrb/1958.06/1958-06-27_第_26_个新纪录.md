    The 26th New Record
    Han Li, Director of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    It was deep in the night, a full half-hour before Class C's shift took over. The shift handover room was already packed with people, waiting for the handover meeting to begin. The Party小组 (small group) of this shift even held a meeting before the handover, deciding that each Party member, in their respective positions, would lead the masses in creating the highest new record, as a gift to the Party.
    "Comrades! First, I have an announcement to make!"
    The shift foreman, who had just returned from the dispatch room to find out the situation, shouted to everyone as he entered:
    "Class B has created another new record! Classes A and B have both created new records to report victories to the Party as a gift. Our Class C must also create the highest new record tonight, as a gift to the Party! Does everyone have confidence?"
    "Yes!" The powerful voice drowned out the ?? sound of the rolling mill outside the door.
    Then the shift foreman analyzed the production conditions of the shift today, put forward precautions, and hoped that each team would seriously discuss and implement them.
    "I have a few words to say, comrades!"
    Someone interjected in the crowd:
    "Adding the new record created by Class B today, we have set a full twenty-five new records in May!..."
    A burst of thunderous applause interrupted the speech.
    "An average of one new record per day. In addition, what we are rolling today is boiler flue tubes, which are recently added urgent orders for the great leap forward in agricultural production. The Party's general line tells us: industry and agriculture should be developed simultaneously. Rolling this batch of tubes well and delivering them early is responding to the call of the Party's general line. Finally, I wish our Class C will once again be at the forefront of the three shifts in rolling small tubes. I am willing to carry the big drum every day."
    People burst into laughter.
    It turned out that the speaker was Comrade Lu Dexin, the section chief of this workshop. Five years ago, he was still the team leader of the piercing machine. Today, he also joined other responsible comrades in the factory to work alongside the shift and engage in "experimental fields." He said he was willing to carry the big drum every day because once Class C created a new record, the factory beat gongs and drums to congratulate Class C, and the section chief and the chairman of the trade union carried the big drum.
    As he spoke, only a few minutes were left in Class B's production time. Everyone in Class C was waiting at their respective posts. They were like athletes entering the finals: ready in their positions, prepared for the stance, waiting for the order. The clock hand pointed exactly to midnight on the 26th, and a burst of cheers swept across the scene. Class B announced the new record: one thousand eight hundred and seventy tubes! At that instant, from the heating furnace, next to the machines, and on all the workbenches, Class C took over the tools from Class B hand-to-hand, operating continuously without interruption for a second. The steel tubes flowed one after another, the sounds of 哗?哗? like cheering for everyone. The people beside the tube rolling machine and the piercing machine, like doctors diagnosing a pulse, constantly watched the second hand on their watches, calculating how many seconds it took to roll a tube. The electricians were even more meticulous, calculating every movement of the machine, even calculating one-fifth of a second. They wished they could turn the steel tubes into a torrent of water!
    As soon as the pointer of the electric meter on the wall pointed to one o'clock, a new big-character poster was posted in front of the piercing machine. It read:
    "The first shot has been fired! The seedling of a new record is here again!
    Who is the hero, who is the brave, let's compare in the middle of the production leap forward!"
    The loudspeaker used for production contact also sent out a call: "Two hundred and forty tubes in the first hour! ...Keep up the good work!"
    The whistle blew briefly, which was a signal for the heating furnace to speed up the incoming material.
    Time moves on. The scene has always been a joyous and tense scene. Every small achievement is encouraged and praised. Every difficulty will immediately receive everyone's support and care. Here, big-character posters and cartoons are very popular forms among workers. Today's cartoon is so fresh, it depicts a weightlifter, and on closer inspection, it turns out that he is lifting steel tubes, with the character "丙" (C) on his vest very eye-catching, plus the words "champion." The workers felt happy from the bottom of their hearts when they saw it.
    Dawn! A night of pleasant and tense labor is about to end. People are coming and going in front of the No. 2 operating table. Because the No. 2 operating table records the production figures, everyone cares about the results of their collective labor.
    Working at the No. 2 operating table is the female operator Li Jinzhi. She has been working at this operating table for five years as if it were one day. The first red-hot steel billet when the factory started was pushed out of the heating furnace by her operation. At that time, she was only seventeen years old and still a country girl who had just entered the city. When she pressed the button on the operating table for the first time, the steel billet suddenly ran along the roller table, making her laugh out loud with joy. Now, this girl is already a master worker. Several apprentices have been taught by her. However, people are still not used to calling her "Master Li," but affectionately call her "Little Li Zi." Near the end of the shift, "Little Li Zi" is always particularly busy, busy answering everyone's inquiries about production figures. "Little Li Zi" is even busier today.
    Finally, the clock hand pointed to eight o'clock, and a short shout came from the loudspeaker:
    "One thousand nine hundred and fifty tubes! One thousand nine hundred and fifty tubes! The highest new record!..." This is Li Jinzhi's voice. Today, she laughed loudly again! Everyone else laughed too.
    All the machines were boiling! At this time, Class A also took over the tools from Class C, and a new pursuit began.
    The excited workers of Class C carried the tribute sign and walked out of the factory building beating gongs and drums to report the victory to the Party committee—since May, they have created the twenty-sixth new record!

    第26个新纪录
    鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂厂长　寒力
    深夜，离丙班接班还有整整半小时。接班室里已经挤满了人，等着开接班会议。这个班的党小组还在接班前召开了小组会，决定每个党员在自己的岗位上，带领群众，在本班创造出最高新纪录，向党献礼。
    “同志们！先向大家报告一个消息！”
    刚由调度室了解情况回来的值班工长，进门就向大家喊着：
    “乙班又是一个新纪录！人家甲乙两班都创了新纪录向党献礼报捷，咱们丙班也一定要在今天夜里，创一个最高新纪录，向党献礼！大家有没有信心？”
    “有！”强有力的声音，掩没了门外??的轧钢机声。
    接着值班工长分析了今天本班的生产条件，提出了注意事项，希望各小组认真讨论执行。
    “我讲两句话，同志们！”
    人群中是谁插上了话：
    “加上今天乙班创造的新纪录，5月份我们整整是二十五个新纪录了！……”
    一阵震耳的掌声打断了讲话。
    “平均每天一个新纪录。另外，我们今天轧的是锅驼机管，这是最近为农业生产大跃进追加的紧急订货。党的总路线告诉我们：工业和农业同时并举。轧好这一批管子提前交货，就是响应了党的总路线的号召。最后，预祝我们丙班在轧小管子上，再一次走在三班的最前面。我愿意天天抬大鼓。”
    人们发出了哄然大笑。
    原来讲话的人是这个工段的段长卢德新同志，五年前，他还是穿孔机的小组长。他今天也和厂里的其他负责同志一块跟班劳动搞“试验田”。他说他愿意天天抬大鼓，原来是有一次丙班创造了新纪录，厂里敲锣打鼓向丙班祝贺，抬大鼓的就是段长和工会主席。
    说着，乙班的生产时间只剩下最后几分钟了。丙班所有的人都等在各自的岗位上。他们像进入决赛的运动员一样：各就各位，预备好姿势，只等令下。时针恰好指到26日零点，现场掀起了一片欢呼，乙班宣布了新纪录：一千八百七十根！就在这一瞬间，从加热炉、机器旁和所有操作台上，丙班手换手的接过了乙班手中的工具，连续操作，一秒钟也没有中断。钢管一根接一根的流着，哗?哗?的响声，像给大家呐喊助威。在轧管机、穿孔机旁的人，像医生诊断脉搏似的不时注视各自手表上的秒针，算算几秒钟轧出一根。电工们更是细致，他们计算着机器的每一个动作，连五分之一秒的时间都要计算。恨不得把钢管变成急水一样的流！
    墙上电表的指针刚指到一点，穿孔机前就贴出了新大字报。上面写着：
    “头一炮打响了！新纪录的苗子又来了！
    谁英雄，谁好汉，生产跃进中间比比看！”
    供生产联系用的喇叭筒里也发出了呼唤声：“第一小时二百四十根！……加油呀！”
    气笛声短促地叫着，这是要加热炉加快来料的信号。
    时间在前进。现场一直是一片欢乐、紧张的景象。每一个微小的成就，都受到鼓励表扬。每一处困难，马上都会得到大家的支持关怀。在这里，大字报、漫画，都是极受工人欢迎的形式。今天的漫画多新鲜，画的是个举重运动员，仔细一看，原来举的是钢管，背心上“丙”字十分耀眼，还外加“冠军”二字。工人看了，从心里往外乐。
    天亮了！一夜愉快紧张的劳动就要结束。二号操作台前人来人往。因为二号操作台上记录着生产数字，每个人都关心自己的集体劳动成果。
    在二号操作台上工作的是女运转工李金芝。她五年如一日的在这个操作台上工作着。这个厂开工的第一根火红的钢胚就是由她操作从加热炉推出的。那时她只有十七岁，还是进城不久的乡下小姑娘呢，当她第一次在操作台上一按电钮，钢胚突的一下顺着辊道跑过来时，乐得她笑出声来。而今，这位姑娘已经是老师傅了。由她教出来的徒弟已是好几名了。不过人们仍然不习惯称呼她“李师傅”，还是亲热的叫她“小李子”。快下班这一会，“小李子”总是特别忙，忙于答复大家询问的生产数字。今天“小李子”更忙了。
    终于时针指到八点，喇叭筒里传出了短促的呼喊：
    “一千九百五十根！一千九百五十根！最高新纪录！……”这是李金芝的声音。今天，她又高声笑了！所有的人也笑了。
    所有的机器旁边都沸腾起来了！这时，甲班同样的又从丙班手里接过工具，新的追赶又开始了。
    丙班工人们兴奋的抬着献礼牌，敲锣打鼓的走出了厂房，向党委报捷——5月以来，他们创造了第二十六个新纪录！
