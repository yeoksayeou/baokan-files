Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 97th meeting this afternoon.

　　After listening to the explanation by Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance, the meeting adopted resolutions, in principle, approving the "Provisional Measures for Financial Management in National Autonomous Areas" and the "Regulations of the State Council on Improving the Tax Management System (Draft)."

　　The "Provisional Measures for Financial Management in National Autonomous Areas" stipulates that the scope of financial revenue and expenditure and management authority of national autonomous areas are broader than those of general areas. This distinction is necessary to implement the state's national policy. It reflects the state's concern for the economic and cultural development of national autonomous areas, embodies the state's granting of greater financial authority to the autonomous organs of national autonomous areas, and provides them with necessary financial support. The implementation of these provisional measures will help the financial management work in national autonomous areas to better adapt to local conditions, help the autonomous organs of various national autonomous areas to fully exert their initiative and enthusiasm in managing local finances, and help accelerate the economic and cultural construction of national autonomous areas.

　　The "Regulations of the State Council on Improving the Tax Management System (Draft)" will be promulgated by the State Council for trial implementation this year. After being revised and supplemented based on the experience of the trial implementation, it will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for formal approval and promulgation. The basic principle of improving the tax management system proposed in this draft is: all taxes that can be managed by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be handed over to them for management; for several taxes that are still managed by the central government, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be given the authority to make flexible adjustments within a certain scope; and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should be allowed to formulate tax measures and levy regional taxes. In this way, it will be conducive for provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to better use taxation as a tool under the unified leadership of the central government, adopt necessary encouragement and restriction measures according to local conditions, promote the development of production, consolidate the socialist economy, and open up financial resources and increase accumulation on the basis of production development.

　　After listening to the explanation by Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance, the meeting discussed the State Council's proposal to stop issuing national bonds from 1959 and instead issue a type of shorter-term local bonds by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. The State Council said in its proposal that since 1954, the state has issued a certain amount of economic construction bonds every year. With the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, the issuance plan has been overfulfilled every year. This has played a certain role in raising construction funds and ensuring the smooth progress of the construction plan. This year, an unprecedented upsurge in production and construction has emerged nationwide. In order to facilitate all localities to better solve the funding problems needed in the great leap forward of socialist construction, and to further implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously under the unified leadership of the central government, the State Council believes that appropriate changes need to be made to the issuance of bonds. The issuance of national bonds will be stopped from 1959, and a type of shorter-term local bonds will be issued by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. There are two major benefits to doing so: (1) Funds can be raised according to local construction needs and the people's ability to purchase bonds, as an auxiliary method to concentrate idle funds to support local construction; (2) Raising funds locally and using them locally can be more closely integrated with the interests of the local people and give fuller play to the role of bonds.

　　The meeting agreed to the State Council's proposal, decided to stop issuing national economic construction bonds from 1959, and adopted the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Local Economic Construction Bonds" (see page 3 today). Chairman Mao has ordered the promulgation of the Regulations on Local Economic Construction Bonds based on the decision of the meeting.

　　The meeting discussed the proposal submitted by the State Council and decided to accede to the "Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air" signed in Warsaw on October 12, 1929.

　　The meeting adopted a resolution approving the establishment of a Tibet Branch of the Supreme People's Court in Tibet by the Supreme People's Court, and the establishment of a Tibet Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate in Tibet by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and appointed Hui Yiran as the President of the Tibet Branch of the Supreme People's Court and Zhi Zemin as the Procurator-General of the Tibet Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

　　The meeting also adopted a resolution approving the "Organizational Regulations of the People's Congresses at All Levels and the People's Committees at All Levels of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region" formulated by the Second Session of the First People's Congress of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Chairman Mao has ordered the promulgation of these regulations today based on the resolution of the meeting. Finally, the meeting approved the list of appointments and removals.

　　人大常委会举行第九十七次会议
    批准财政税收管理权下放
    毛主席命令公布地方经济建设公债条例
    新华社5日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会在今天下午举行了第九十七次会议。
    会议在听了财政部副部长吴波的说明后，分别通过决议，原则批准国务院关于“民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法”和“国务院关于改进税收管理体制的规定（草案）”。
    “民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法”中规定，民族自治地方的财政收支范围和管理职权，比一般地区更广泛一些。这种区别是贯彻执行国家的民族政策所必需的，它体现了国家对民族自治地方的经济和文化事业发展的关心，体现了国家给予民族自治地方的自治机关以较大的财政权限，并且给予了它们以必要的财政支援。这个暂行办法的实施，将有利于民族自治地方的财政管理工作更好地因地制宜，有利于各民族自治地方的自治机关充分发挥管理本地方财政的主动性和积极性，有利于用更快的速度发展民族自治地方的经济和文化建设事业。
    “国务院关于改进税收管理体制的规定（草案）”将由国务院颁布在今年内试行，并且根据试行的经验修正补充后，再提请人大常委会正式批准公布。这个草案提出的改进税收管理体制的基本原则是：凡是可以由省、自治区、直辖市负责管理的税收，应当交给省、自治区、直辖市管理；若干仍然由中央管理的税收，在一定的范围内，给省、自治区、直辖市以机动调整的权限；并且允许省、自治区、直辖市制定税收办法，开征地区性的税收。这样，就有利于省、自治区、直辖市在中央的统一领导下，根据当地的实际情况，更好地运用税收这一工具，采取必要的鼓励和限制的措施，促进生产的发展，巩固社会主义经济，并且在生产发展的基础上，开辟财源，增加积累。
    会议在听了财政部副部长吴波的说明后，讨论了国务院关于从1959年起停止发行全国性的公债，改由各省、自治区、直辖市发行一种比较短期的地方公债的议案。国务院在议案中说，从1954年开始，国家每年发行一定数量的经济建设公债。在全国人民的热烈支持下，每年都超额完成了发行计划。这对于筹集建设资金，保证建设计划的顺利进行，起了一定的作用。今年在全国范围内出现了一个规模空前的生产建设高潮。为了便利各地更好地解决在社会主义建设大跃进中所需要的资金问题，进一步贯彻执行在中央统一领导下发展工业和发展农业同时并举、发展中央工业和发展地方工业同时并举、大型企业、中型企业和小型企业同时并举的方针，国务院认为关于公债的发行需要作适当的改变，全国性的公债准备从1959年起停止发行，而由各省、自治区、直辖市发行一种比较短期的地方公债。这样做，有以下两大好处：（一）可以根据当地建设需要和人民购买公债的能力，因地制宜地筹集资金，作为集中闲散资金支援地方建设的一种辅助方法；（二）就地筹集资金就地办事，可以同当地人民的利益更加密切地结合起来，更充分地发挥公债的作用。
    会议同意国务院的建议，决定从1959年起停止发行国家经济建设公债，并且通过了“中华人民共和国地方经济建设公债条例”（见今日第三版），毛主席已根据会议的决定，命令公布地方经济建设公债条例。
    会议讨论了国务院提出的议案，决定加入1929年10月12日在华沙签订的“为统一有关国际空运某些规定的公约”。
    会议通过决议，批准最高人民法院在西藏设立最高人民法院西藏分院，最高人民检察院在西藏设立最高人民检察院西藏分院，并任命惠毅然为最高人民法院西藏分院院长，智泽民为最高人民检察院西藏分院检察长。
    会议还通过决议，批准新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁哈萨克自治州第一届人民代表大会第二次会议制定的新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁哈萨克自治州各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会组织条例，毛主席根据会议的决议，已在今天命令公布这个条例。会议最后通过了任免名单。
