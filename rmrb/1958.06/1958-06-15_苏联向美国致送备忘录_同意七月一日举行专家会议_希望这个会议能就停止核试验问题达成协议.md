Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 14th: The Soviet government sent a memorandum to the U.S. government on June 13th, stating that it agrees to hold a meeting of experts in Geneva on July 1st to study methods for detecting nuclear explosions, and submitted a list of experts that the Soviet Union is prepared to send to the meeting.

The Soviet government reiterated in the memorandum that the experts' meeting should be concluded in the shortest possible time, and expressed the hope that this meeting would enable countries possessing nuclear weapons to reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing.

The memorandum stated that it noted the U.S. government's affirmative reply to the question that the participants in the experts' meeting would consist of experts from the U.S., Britain, and France on one side, and experts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland on the other; thus, the question of the composition of the experts' meeting can be considered to have been agreed upon.

However, the Soviet government still expressed its regret that an agreement had not been reached at the current stage of negotiations to allow Indian experts to participate in the meeting from the very beginning.

The memorandum informed the United States that the Soviet experts participating in the meeting would include Fedorov, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and seven others.

The memorandum also stated that the Soviet government does not object to allowing the United Nations Secretariat to participate in the technical service work of the experts' meeting and to record the proceedings of the meeting in written form.

The Soviet government's memorandum was a reply to Eisenhower's letter to Khrushchev on June 10th, and it was delivered to the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on the 13th.

    苏联向美国致送备忘录
    同意七月一日举行专家会议
    希望这个会议能就停止核试验问题达成协议
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府13日给美国政府一份备忘录，表示同意于7月1日在日内瓦举行研究发现核爆炸方法的专家会议，并且提出了苏联准备派去参加会议的专家名单。
    苏联政府在备忘录中重申：专家会议应该在最短期内结束，并且希望这个会议会使拥有核武器的国家就停止核试验问题达成协议。
    备忘录说，注意到美国政府对以下问题的肯定答复，即专家会议的参加者以美、英、法三国的专家为一方；苏、捷、波三国的专家为另一方；这样，关于专家会议的成员问题可以认为已经达成协议了。
    但是，苏联政府仍然表示很遗憾，因为在谈判的现阶段还没有达成协议，使印度专家在会议一开始时就能参加。
    这个备忘录通知美国，苏联参加会议的专家将有苏联科学院通讯院士费多罗夫等八人。
    备忘录还说，苏联政府不反对让联合国秘书处参加专家会议的技术服务工作并且用记录的形式把会议情况记录下来。
    苏联政府的备忘录是回答艾森豪威尔6月10日给赫鲁晓夫的信的，它已经在13日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给了美国驻苏联大使汤普逊。
