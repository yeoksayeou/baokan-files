Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Since the Sino-Japanese Private Fishery Agreement was signed in Beijing in April 1955, and extended twice in 1956 and 1957, it will expire on June 12, 1958. The China Fisheries Association telegraphed the Japan-China Fisheries Council today, pointing out that because the Japanese Kishida Nobusuke government is currying favor with the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan and adopting an extremely unfriendly policy that is hostile to our 600 million people, the Kishida Nobusuke government has completely destroyed the basis of friendly cooperation between the fishery circles of China and Japan. Under these circumstances, the Chinese side cannot consider extending the Sino-Japanese Private Fishery Agreement. The China Fisheries Association's telegram also pointed out that if the Kishida Nobusuke government does not change its hostile attitude towards our country and continues to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy and continues to obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, then the issue of signing a Sino-Japanese private fishery agreement cannot be considered either.
    The full text of the China Fisheries Association's telegram to the Japan-China Fisheries Council is as follows:
    To the Japan-China Fisheries Council, Mr. Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman:
    Your letters and telegrams of March 7, April 17, May 2, and May 31, 1958, have been received.
    Over the past three years, the signing and implementation of the Sino-Japanese Private Fishery Agreement have been beneficial to the establishment of friendship between the fishery circles of China and Japan. However, because your country's Kishida Nobusuke government is currying favor with the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan and openly adopting an extremely unfriendly policy hostile to our 600 million people, the basis of friendly cooperation between the fishery circles of China and Japan has been completely destroyed by the Kishida Nobusuke government. Under these circumstances, we regret to inform you that the issue of extending the Sino-Japanese Private Fishery Agreement cannot be considered.
    Under the circumstances that the state of war between China and Japan has not ended and normal relations between the two countries have not been restored, it would not have been possible to sign a Sino-Japanese private fishery agreement in the first place if it were not on the basis of increasing friendship. In the future, if the Kishida Nobusuke government does not change its hostile attitude towards our country and continues to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy and continues to obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, the issue of signing a Sino-Japanese private fishery agreement cannot be considered either.
    I now, on behalf of the China Fisheries Association, solemnly inform you that after the expiration of the agreement, the China Fisheries Association will no longer assume obligations for the various provisions of the past agreement.
    Reply,
     China Fisheries Association Director Yang Yu
                June 11, 1958

    岸信介政府破坏了两国渔业界合作的基础
    中日民间渔业协定不再延长
    我渔业协会致电日本日中渔业协议会
    新华社11日讯　中日民间渔业协定自从1955年4月在北京签订以来，经过1956年和1957年两次延期，将于1958年6月12日满期。中国渔业协会在今天打电报给日本日中渔业协议会，指出由于日本岸信介政府取媚台湾蒋介石集团，采取敌视我国六亿人民的极不友好的政策，岸信介政府已将中日两国渔业界友好合作的基础破坏无遗，在此情况下，中国方面无法考虑延长中日民间渔业协定的问题。中国渔业协会的电报中还指出，如果岸信介政府不改变它对我国的敌视态度，而继续制造两个中国的阴谋，继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，那末，中日两国民间渔业协定的签订问题也是不能考虑的。
    中国渔业协会致日本日中渔业协议会的电报全文如下：
    日本日中渔业协议会，会长平冢常次郎先生：
    贵会1958年3月7日、4月17日、5月2日和5月31日的来函来电，都已收悉。
    三年来，中日民间渔业协定的签订和执行，曾对中日两国民间渔业界友谊的建立有所裨益，但是由于贵国岸信介政府取媚台湾蒋介石集团，公开采取敌视我国六亿人民的极不友好的政策，中日两国渔业界友好合作的基础，已被岸信介政府破坏无遗。在此种情况下，我们很遗憾地通告贵方，延长中日民间渔业协定的问题，是无法加以考虑的。
    在中日两国战争状态并未结束、两国的正常关系并未恢复的情况下，如果不是在友好日益增进的基础上，本来是没有任何可能签订中日两国的民间渔业协定的。今后，如果岸信介政府不改变它对我国的敌视态度，而继续制造两个中国的阴谋，继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，中日两国民间渔业协定的签订问题也是无法加以考虑的。
    我现在代表中国渔业协会郑重地通告贵方，在协定满期以后，中国渔业协会对于过去协定的各项规定将不再承担义务。
    此复
      中国渔业协会主任　杨煜
                1958年6月11日
