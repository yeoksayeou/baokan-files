	Admitting Without Being Pressed
	U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference on the 18th that the execution of Hungarian traitor Nagy "shocked" the American ruling clique and "thwarted hopes for convening an East-West summit." It seems that this American president is extremely saddened by Nagy's execution.
	Nagy was an agent of imperialism in Hungary, so the execution of this counter-revolutionary criminal would naturally cause heartache to the likes of Eisenhower. However, the fact that this matter has become an excuse for Eisenhower to sabotage the summit reveals the ulterior motives of the American ruling clique toward the summit, which is that they are racking their brains to bury the summit.
	Therefore, Eisenhower's above remarks not only exposed the American ruling clique as the behind-the-scenes wire-puller of the Nagy counter-revolutionary clique, but also exposed them as the saboteurs of the summit. This is called admitting without being pressed.
	Best Proof
	On June 18, the Iraqi-Jordanian Federal Parliament passed the first federal budget. The total expenditure is over 89 million U.S. dollars, of which the appropriations for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the courts, and the Federal Prime Minister only account for 5%, while military appropriations account for 95%. This can be said to be the largest proportion of military appropriations in the budget of any country in the world.
	Why is such a huge military budget set? According to a report in the Damascus "Victory Daily" on June 10, six battalions of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federal Army and part of the Air Force have, on the orders of U.S. and British imperialism, entered Lebanon to join the Chamoun forces and suppress the rebellious people. This news can help people understand the use of this military budget.
	The people of Middle Eastern countries have long pointed out that the so-called Iraqi-Jordanian Federation is actually a military group used by imperialism. A budget with military spending accounting for 95% is the best proof.

    札记
    不打自招
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在18日的记者招待会上说，匈牙利叛国罪犯纳吉的伏法“震动了”美国统治集团，并使“召开东西方最高级会议的希望受到挫折”。看来，这位美国总统对于纳吉的被处决真是哀伤备至了。
    纳吉是帝国主义在匈牙利的代理人，因而这个反革命罪犯的被处决当然是会使艾森豪威尔之流感到心痛的。可是，这件事竟成为艾森豪威尔破坏最高级会议的借口，却未免暴露了美国统治集团对待最高级会议的不可告人的用心，那就是他们要挖空心思来把最高级会议埋葬掉。
    因而，艾森豪威尔的上述谈话，不但暴露了美国统治集团是纳吉反革命集团的幕后牵线人，而且也暴露了他们是最高级会议的破坏者。这叫做不打自招。
    最好的证明
    6月18日，伊拉克—约旦联邦议会通过了第一个联邦预算。总开支是八千九百多万美元，其中，外交部、财政部、法院和联邦首相的拨款仅占5％，而军事拨款却占了95％。这可以说是世界各国预算中军事拨款比例最大的一个了。
    为什么订出如此庞大的军事预算呢？据6月10日大马士革“胜利报”报道说，六个营的伊拉克—约旦联邦军队和部分空军，已经奉美英帝国主义的命令开入黎巴嫩，参加夏蒙部队，镇压起义人民。这则消息很可以帮助人们来了解这笔军事预算的用途。
    中东各国人民早已指出，所谓伊拉克—约旦联邦，实际上是帝国主义御用的一个军事集团。军费占95％的预算，就是最好的证明。
