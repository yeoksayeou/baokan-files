Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th: According to today's "Financial Times," the impact of the American economic crisis on the Canadian economy is becoming increasingly obvious.

The newspaper's correspondent from Montreal reported that Canadian steel industry production has been shrinking in recent months, with output for the first four months of this year down 14% from the same period a year ago.

The value of Canada's exports in the first four months of this year also decreased from $1,642.5 million in the same period last year to $1,441.6 million.

Economist Dr. J. Petrie predicted at the annual meeting of the Canadian Purchasing Agents Association that economic conditions are unlikely to improve in the next twelve months.
