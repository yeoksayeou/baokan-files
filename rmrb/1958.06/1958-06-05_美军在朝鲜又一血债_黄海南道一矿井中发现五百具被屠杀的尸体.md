　　Another Blood Debt of the U.S. Military in Korea
    Five Hundred Bodies of Murdered People Discovered in a Mine Shaft in South Hwanghae Province
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 3rd: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency today, when the flooded shaft of the Rakwon (transliteration) mine in Jangyeon County, South Hwanghae Province, was being restored, a monstrous crime committed by U.S. imperialism was discovered there.

    In this shaft, which was destroyed by U.S. imperialists and is one hundred meters deep, a pile of corpses including no fewer than five hundred people was found, some of which had already turned into skeletons. Among these murdered people were many women and children. Some women were killed together with the children they were carrying on their backs. The corpses were bound with copper wire. This proves that the American executioners brutally tortured them before throwing them into the mine shaft.

    U.S. imperialists occupied this area from October to December 1950 during the Korean War of Aggression. According to an investigation by the Korean government, the massacre was organized by U.S. Army Lieutenant Harrison, whose headquarters were located in Sinchon, fifty kilometers northeast of the mining area. During this period, the American executioners massacred more than 9,000 people in the mining area and other places in Cheongyeon County, and more than 35,000 people in Sinchon.

    While excavating the bodies of these victims, the workers of the Rakwon mine expressed great indignation at the heinous crimes of the U.S. military. When female worker Li De-yi accused the U.S. imperialists of their atrocities, she said that the U.S. military committed all kinds of evil deeds when they occupied the mine, including raping women and strangling innocent children. Because female worker Jiang Yushan was an active worker, the American executioners threw her and her three children on the tracks in the mine and ran them over with a car. Li De-yi said that she herself had been imprisoned with her husband. Although she escaped, her husband was killed. The mine director of this mine, Park Ki-wan (transliteration), said that the world has once again seen a bloody crime committed by U.S. imperialists. He condemned U.S. imperialism for continuing to occupy southern Korea and for plotting to launch another war in Korea. He demanded that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from South Korea.

### 美军在朝鲜又一血债  黄海南道一矿井中发现五百具被屠杀的尸体

　　美军在朝鲜又一血债
    黄海南道一矿井中发现五百具被屠杀的尸体
    新华社平壤3日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社今天报道，在黄海南道长渊郡乐渊（译音）矿井恢复一个遭水淹的竖井的时候，发现了美帝国主义在那里犯下了一个滔天罪行。
    在这个遭美帝国主义者破坏的深一百公尺的竖井里发现了包括不下五百人的一堆尸体，其中有一些已经变成骷髅。在这些被杀害的人中有很多妇女和儿童。有些妇女是同背负着的孩子一起被杀死的。尸体上捆着铜线。这证明了美国刽子手是在残酷地折磨他们之后才把他们丢在矿井里的。
    美帝国主义者在侵略朝鲜战争的时候，曾经在1950年10月到12月占领这个地方。据朝鲜政府调查，组织这次屠杀的是美军中尉哈里逊，他的总部设在这个矿区东北五十公里的信川。美国刽子手们在这个时期在清渊郡这个矿区和其他地方一共屠杀了九千多人，在信川屠杀了三万五千人以上。
    乐渊矿场的工人们在发掘这些遇害者的尸体时，对美国军队的穷凶极恶表示极大的愤慨。女工李德一在控诉美帝国主义暴行时说，美军在占领这个矿场时，奸淫妇女和扼杀无辜儿童等无恶不作。由于女工姜玉善是一个工作积极的女工，美国刽子手竟将她和三个儿女扔在矿里的路轨上用车子把她们碾死。李德一说，她本人也曾经同丈夫一起被囚禁。她虽然逃生，但是，她的丈夫被杀害了。这个矿井的矿长朴基万（译音）说，全世界又看到了美帝国主义者所干的一起血腥罪行。他谴责美帝国主义继续占领朝鲜南部并且阴谋在朝鲜发动另一次战争。他要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
