Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Beijing's philosophical and economic circles recently held a series of symposiums to commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." In addition to full-time philosophy and economics researchers and teachers, participants included staff from national financial and economic institutions, the Party secretaries of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, the Party secretary of Beijing's Chaoyang District, and the directors of the Red Star and Golden Star Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the suburbs, totaling over two hundred people.

Attendees unanimously emphasized that Chairman Mao's work is a model of creatively solving the practical problems of China's socialist construction by applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism and is a major development of Marxist-Leninist theory. To commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," it is necessary to thoroughly and cleanly uproot the white flag of the bourgeoisie in all fields of philosophy and social science, raise the red flag of Marxism-Leninism even higher, and thoroughly criticize bourgeois idealist thought. Philosophy and social science workers must further conscientiously transform themselves and learn Chairman Mao's style of integrating theory with practice, honestly learning from the masses and from practice, and push theoretical research and theoretical criticism to a new stage.

Pan Zinian, Director of the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out that the work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is the theoretical foundation of the general line of socialist construction in our country. Chairman Mao's philosophy has always been extracted from practice and, in turn, gives tremendous guidance to practice. Scientific workers must learn this spirit from Chairman Mao, take workers, peasants, and soldiers as their teachers, go deep into practice, and study and discover problems, which will fundamentally change their academic style and develop philosophy. Yu Guangyuan, a member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his speech that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," people can promptly make many links in the superstructure and relations of production more suitable for fully leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of the people to accelerate socialist construction. Sun Yefang, Acting Director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his speech that economics workers must earnestly study philosophy, especially Chairman Mao's theory on the two types of contradictions and other philosophical works, and comprehend Chairman Mao's profound philosophical thought to guide their research work.

Economist Sun Xiaocun said in his speech that Chairman Mao's theory on correctly handling contradictions of two different natures has enabled bourgeois elements in our country to further recognize their dual nature and their future, thereby encouraging them to consciously confide in the Party and actively accept socialist transformation.

The several symposiums held by the philosophical and economic circles themselves are classrooms for integrating theory with practice. Many staff members from agricultural cooperatives and other business departments used countless vivid facts from the Great Leap Forward to illustrate that once Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is grasped by the people, it forms endless material strength and becomes a huge driving force for promoting socialist construction. The speeches of these comrades engaged in practical work gave great encouragement and enlightenment to the more than two hundred scientists and young scientific workers present. Shan Zhaoxiang, Secretary of the Chaoyang District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, and Ma Jinhe, Director of the Golden Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, said in their speeches that although this year's production in Chaoyang District and the Golden Star Cooperative has already made great leaps forward, compared with many regions, they are still in the middle or even lower reaches, and the potential for production in all aspects is still very large. They said that Chairman Mao taught us to continuously make revolution, and new contradictions will arise after one contradiction is resolved. After a mass debate recently in Chaoyang District and the Golden Star Cooperative, leading cadres and peasants criticized the conservative and dependent thinking caused by good production conditions and resolved to work hard and strive for the top.

    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说
    奠定总路线的理论基础
    北京哲学界和经济学界纪念毛主席著作发表一周年
    据新华社18日讯　北京哲学界和经济学界最近连续举行座谈会，纪念毛主席的著作“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年。参加会议的除专职的哲学和经济学研究和教学工作者外，并有国家财经机关的工作人员，石景山钢铁厂、长辛店机车车辆修理厂的党委书记，北京市朝阳区区委书记和郊区红星、金星两农业生产合作社的主任等共二百多人。
    到会者一致强调指出，毛主席的这一著作，是运用马克思列宁主义的原理创造性地解决中国社会主义建设的实际问题的典范，是马克思列宁主义学说的重大发展。纪念“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年，就要在哲学和社会科学的各个领域彻底干净地拔掉资产阶级的白旗，更高地举起马克思列宁主义的红旗，彻底批判资产阶级唯心主义思想。哲学和社会科学工作者要进一步认真改造自己，并且要学习毛主席的理论联系实际的作风，老老实实地向群众学习，向实际学习，把理论研究和理论批判工作推向一个新的阶段。
    中国科学院哲学研究所所长潘梓年指出，“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一著作是我国社会主义建设总路线的理论基础。毛主席的哲学从来就是从实践中提炼而来，并且反过来给实践以巨大的指导作用。科学工作者必须向毛主席学习这种精神，拜工农兵人民群众为师，深入实际，研究和发现问题，这才能从根本上改变学风，发展哲学。中国科学院哲学社会科学部委员于光远在发言中指出，在毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一著作的思想指导下，人们能够及时地使上层建筑和生产关系的许多环节，更加适合充分发挥人民群众积极性和创造性的需要，以加速社会主义建设。中国科学院经济研究所代理所长孙冶方在发言中指出，经济学工作者必须认真学习哲学，特别必须认真学习毛主席关于两类矛盾的学说和其他哲学著作，领会毛主席深刻的哲学思想，以虚带实，指导自己的研究工作。
    经济学家孙晓村在发言中说，毛主席关于正确处理两种性质不同的矛盾的学说，使我国资产阶级分子进一步认识自己的两面性和自己的前途，从而鼓舞他们自觉地向党交心，积极接受社会主义改造。
    哲学界和经济学界召开的几次座谈会本身就是理论联系实际的课堂。许多来自农业社和其他业务部门的工作人员，用大跃进中无数生动的事实说明，毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论一为人民群众所掌握，就形成了无穷无尽的物质力量，成为推动社会主义建设的巨大动力。这些担任实际工作的同志的发言，给到会的二百多名科学家、青年科学工作者以很大的鼓舞和启示。中共北京市朝阳区委书记单昭祥和北京市郊金星农业生产合作社主任马金河在发言中谈到，朝阳区和金星社今年的生产虽然已经有了很大的跃进，但是同很多地区比较，还是处于中游甚至下游，各方面的生产潜力还很大。他们说，毛主席教导我们要不断革命，一个矛盾解决了还会产生新的矛盾。朝阳区和金星社最近经过群众性的大辩论后，领导干部和农民都批判了由于生产条件好而产生的保守和依赖思想，决心大干苦干，力争上游。
