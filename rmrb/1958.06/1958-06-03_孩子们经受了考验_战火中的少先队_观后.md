　　Children Undergo the Test
　　--After Watching "Young Pioneers in the Flames of War"
    Lao Gu
    The film "Young Pioneers in the Flames of War," produced by the Gorky Film Studio in Moscow, is adapted from the second part of Osheyeva's novel "Vasyok Trubachev and His Comrades."

    The story takes place in June 1941. A group of Young Pioneers from Moscow, led by their teacher, are guests in Kiev, Ukraine. They are welcomed, and the farm chairman, Stepan, congratulates the dear guests, hoping they will rest and recuperate well during their visit, grow up strong like trees, and support the Communist Youth League in the future. However, while these Young Pioneers are camping, war breaks out. Fascist Germany suddenly attacks the Soviet Union, crossing the border. They live not far from the front lines, and the flames of war quickly spread. It is impossible to return to Moscow, so they immediately become involved in the Great Patriotic War. These Young Pioneers assist the guerrillas in many tasks during the war, fully demonstrating their courage, resourcefulness, and spirit of loving their country and hating the enemy. Although they are so young, they accomplish great things. Finally, a plane crosses the front lines and sends them back to Moscow.

    From the film, we see the spiritual outlook of the Soviet Young Pioneers, and we can't help but think of the children's corps in our anti-Japanese base areas during the War of Resistance and stories like "Chicken Feather Letter." Children educated under the Communist Party are full of courage and have a tradition of loving their country. They are inviolable and promising children. The tenacious fighting spirit of the older generation of Bolsheviks inspires and educates them. Vasyok, the Young Pioneer squad leader, once said, "I read in a book that a hero also delivered a letter during the civil war and was caught by the White bandits. Do you know what he did? He swallowed the letter." They gained strength and inspiration from stories like these.

    The film thus depicts the image of a new generation growing up under the Soviet system. They are all lively and strong in peacetime, and in times of emergency, they all have clear-cut love and hate and firm will. In the test of war, they show everywhere that they are worthy of being the descendants of communism. When these little soldiers say goodbye to the guerrillas, the tractor station chief says to them, "Please convey our respects from all the guerrillas to your fathers, mothers, and teachers. Pay tribute to your school, which has cultivated you very well, cultivated you into brave and loyal people. We have seen all this."

    This passage is a conclusion that the film makes to us, and this conclusion is very profound. It will remain in the hearts of the audience forever, along with the images of those children.

　　——“战火中的少先队”观后

    莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂出品的“战火中的少先队”影片，是根据奥谢耶娃的小说“瓦肖克·特鲁巴切夫和他的伙伴”第二部改编的。
    故事发生在1941年6月里，莫斯科的一队少年队员在老师的率领下，去乌克兰基辅作客，他们受到了欢迎，农庄主席斯切潘祝贺亲爱的客人，希望他们在作客期间好好休息，疗养，恢复体力，希望他们好好长大，结实得像大树，将来好支援共青团。可是就在这些少先队野营的时候，打起仗来了，法西斯德国对苏联突然进攻，越过国境线。他们住的地方离火线不远，战火很快地就燃烧过来，回莫斯科已不可能，他们就马上卷入到卫国战争中去。这些少先队员在战火中协助游击队做了许多工作，充分表现了他们的勇敢、机智和热爱祖国、憎恨敌人的精神。他们年纪虽然那么小，可是办了大事。最后飞机越过火线把他们送回了莫斯科。
    从影片里我们看到了苏联少先队的精神面貌，也不禁使我们想到抗战时期我国抗日根据地的儿童团以及像“鸡毛信”那一类的故事。在共产党教养下的儿童，都是富于勇敢精神和热爱祖国的传统的。他们都是不可侮的，有出息的孩子。老一代的布尔什维克的顽强的战斗精神在鼓舞和教育着他们。少先队小队长瓦肖克曾经说：“我在书上看到过，说内战时候有个英雄也送过一封信，给白匪抓住了，你知道他怎么办？他就把信吞下去了。”他们就是在诸如此类的故事中得到了力量和启示。
    影片就是这样地描写了在苏维埃制度下成长起来的新的一代的形象。他们在平时个个活泼，结实，到了紧急关头，个个都是爱憎分明，意志坚定。在战火的考验里，他们处处表现了无愧于共产主义的后代。当这群小战士们向游击队员们告别的时候，那位拖拉机站长对他们说：“请你们代表我们全体游击队员，向你们的父亲、母亲和老师们致敬。向你们的学校致敬，它把你们培养得很好，培养成为勇敢、忠实的人，这些，我们都看见了。”
    这一段话，是影片向我们作的一个结论，这个结论是十分深刻的，它将同那些孩子们的形象，永远留在观众们的心头。
