    Also a Test

    In the great leap forward of agricultural production, agricultural cooperatives in various places have increased the number of times they have treated crop diseases and insect pests compared with previous years, and the amount of chemical pesticides required has also greatly increased. According to relevant departments, the production of chemical pesticides this year has increased more than ten times compared with last year. However, compared with the even faster-growing needs, it is still far from enough. Therefore, the supply of chemical pesticides is very tight, and many areas have already sold out. As a result, some people have developed negative and pessimistic sentiments, believing that it is impossible to eliminate pests.
    Is it really impossible to control insects without chemical pesticides? In fact, it is not. Wengjiang Township in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, needed more than 40,000 jin of chemical pesticides this year, but the commercial department could only supply 3,500 jin. This township did not become negative or pessimistic because of the insufficient supply of chemical pesticides. Liu Maoqing, the secretary of the township party committee, was inspired by the fact that local people used poisonous herbs like Artemisia and Sapium sebiferum to kill maggots and flies. He thought, why can't we use poisonous herbs to kill crop pests? His idea was supported by the Party organization, and a forum was immediately held with the participation of doctors, veterinarians, old farmers, cadres sent to lower levels, and herbal medicine practitioners to consult them; and the past experience of local farmers in using indigenous methods to control insects was summarized. After repeated experiments, 18 kinds of effective insecticides were made using various poisonous herbs. Santai County in Sichuan also relied on the masses to produce 110,000 jin of pesticides using indigenous methods. In order to solve the problem of insufficient chemical pesticides, the commercial department of Fengjie County also broke with convention and used indigenous methods to refine a large amount of pesticide, copper sulfate. It can be seen that there are not few, but many ways and means to solve the shortage of pesticides. Although some of these homemade pesticides are not as efficient as chemical pesticides, they are much better than having no pesticides at all.
    China's socialist construction is developing rapidly by leaps and bounds, and it is impossible not to encounter various difficulties on the road forward. The current production of chemical pesticides far from meeting the needs of agricultural production is one such difficulty. Faced with this difficulty, some people cannot see the power and wisdom of the masses, and only know how to reach out to the state for chemical pesticides, resulting in being at a loss and causing losses to work. But in the face of the same difficulty, those who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to jump out of the old circle, and rely on the masses can come up with many ways to overcome difficulties. This sharp contrast can be seen everywhere now.
    In the struggle to rapidly develop agricultural production, we will continue to encounter difficulties, both large and small. How to deal with difficulties will always be a test that all revolutionary comrades must undergo. Those comrades who can find ways to overcome difficulties themselves will prove that they are truly revolutionaries who are qualified to assume leadership responsibilities. Those who are discouraged, complain, and immediately retreat when they encounter difficulties, if they do not completely change their attitude, they will definitely become a conservative force in practice, and no longer a revolutionary force.

    也是一个考验
    尚业
    在农业生产大跃进当中，各地农业社为了提高单位面积产量，除治农作物病虫害的次数比往年增多了，所需要的化学农药也大大增加。据有关部门谈，今年化学农药的生产比去年增长了十几倍。但是比起增长得更快的需要来，还差得很远。因此化学农药的供应十分紧张，许多地区已经脱销。于是，有些人就发生了消极悲观情绪，认为要消灭虫害是办不到的了。
    果真没有化学农药就不能治虫了吗？其实不然。湖南平江县瓮江乡今年一共需要四万多斤化学农药，商业部门只能供应三千五百斤。这个乡并没有因为化学农药供应不足而消极悲观。乡党委书记刘懋清从当地利用毒草蒿桐青能杀蛆灭蝇的事实得到启发，他想，为什么不可以用毒草来除杀农作物害虫呢？他的想法得到了党组织的支持，并立即召开了一次有医生、兽医、老农、下放干部、草药郎中等参加的座谈会，向他们请教；并总结了本地农民过去用土法治虫的经验。经过反复试验，结果利用各种毒草制出了十八种有效的杀虫药剂。四川三台县也是依靠群众用土办法制出了十一万斤农药。奉节县商业部门为了解决化学农药不足的问题，也打破常规，自己用土法炼制出大量农药硫酸铜。可见解决农药不足的办法和门路不是很少而是很多的。这些土制农药有的虽然不及化学农药效率高，但是比起根本没有农药来，却不知强了多少倍。
    我国社会主义建设正在一日千里地飞快发展，在前进的道路上不可能不遇到这样那样的困难。目前化学农药生产远不能满足农业生产的需要，就是一个困难。在这个困难面前，有的人看不见群众的力量和智慧，只知道伸手向国家要化学农药，结果是束手无策，使工作遭受损失。但是在同样的困难面前，那些敢想敢说敢干，敢于跳出旧圈子和依靠群众的人们，就能够想出许多办法，战胜困难。这种尖锐的对比现在到处可以看到。
    在迅速发展农业生产的斗争中，我们还要不断地遇到大大小小的困难。怎样对待困难，永远是一切革命同志必须经受的一种考验。那些能够自己想办法克服困难的同志，将证明他们是有资格担任领导责任的真正的革命者。那些一遇到困难就垂头丧气，怨天尤人，马上打退堂鼓的人，如果不彻底改变态度，他们就一定会在实际上成为一种保守力量，而不再是革命力量。
