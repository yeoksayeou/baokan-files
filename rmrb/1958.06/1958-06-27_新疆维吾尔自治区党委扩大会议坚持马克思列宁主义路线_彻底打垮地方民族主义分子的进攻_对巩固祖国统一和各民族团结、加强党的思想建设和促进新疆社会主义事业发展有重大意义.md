Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 26th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting attended by 381 responsible党员 cadres from the autonomous region, autonomous prefectures, special districts, and counties. At the meeting, after a long period of full discussion, a decisive victory was achieved in the struggle against local nationalism, which has great significance for consolidating national unity and ethnic solidarity, strengthening Party ideological construction, and promoting the development of socialism in Xinjiang.

After listening to the report by Comrade Saifuddin, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, entitled "Resolutely Oppose Local Nationalism and Strive for the Great Victory of Socialism" (Note: This report was published in the People's Daily on December 26th last year), the meeting seriously studied and discussed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Movement" from the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out rectification and socialist education among ethnic minorities. The meeting adopted methods such as extensive airing of views and writing big-character posters, and conducted a serious and fierce struggle against the main current danger existing within the Party in Xinjiang – local nationalism. The comrades who spoke at the meeting first refuted with a large number of facts all the slanders of the right-wing local nationalists against the Party, affirming the great achievements made by the Party in Xinjiang over the past eight years. They waged a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements and local nationalists hidden within the Party: Ziya Samet, Director of the Autonomous Region's Cultural Bureau, Secretary of the Party Group of the Cultural Bureau, Chairman of the Autonomous Region's Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Chairman of the Writers Association's Autonomous Region Branch; Iblayin Tuerdi, Director of the Autonomous Region's Civil Affairs Bureau, Secretary of the Party Group of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Vice Chairman of the Writers Association's Autonomous Region Branch; Abudureyim Aisa, Alternate Member of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Vice Governor of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture; and the local nationalist and class alien A. Sayed, Mayor of Urumqi; Abulizi Kari, Deputy Director of the Autonomous Region's Department of Commerce, and expelled them from the Party. Serious criticisms were made of some people who had committed serious local nationalist errors, and serious treatment was given according to the severity of the errors committed by each individual and the performance of confession and repentance. As the criticism and struggle deepened gradually, some people who held liberalist and sentimentalist attitudes at the beginning of the meeting also changed their attitudes, and a large number of activists emerged at the meeting.

 各族党员负责干部发言
 各 Ethnic Party Member Responsible Cadres Speak
 彻底揭露和批判地方民族主义分子的罪行
 Thoroughly Expose and Criticize the Crimes of Local Nationalists
 坚决反对把新疆从祖国大家庭中分裂出去
 Resolutely Oppose Splitting Xinjiang from the Motherland

At this meeting, a total of 1,278 speeches were made. Most of the speakers were responsible Party cadres of various local ethnic groups. They mercilessly exposed and criticized the reactionary crimes of local nationalists in undermining national unity and splitting national solidarity.

Anniwar Shalijiang (Kazakh), Director of the Third Division of the Autonomous Region Public Security Department, said: Local nationalists, cloaked in ethnic garb, portray themselves as representatives and protectors of the ethnic group, creating antagonism and hostility between ethnic groups and among all strata of their own ethnic group. In order to satisfy their insatiable personal demands, some people do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the ethnic group to imperialism. Therefore, they are no different from the scum of the past in the ethnic group. The local nationalists' slander of our country's policy of ethnic regional autonomy, as well as the demand for the establishment of a republic, is in essence an attempt to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Nusreti (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the Autonomous Region Planning Commission, said in his speech: Local nationalists such as A. Sayed spread rumors that the Party did not pay attention to promoting and training ethnic minority cadres. What are the facts? The number of ethnic minority Party members in Urumqi increased from 27 in 1951 to 608 in 1957, an increase of 22 times. Of the 23 members of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the CPC, 39% are ethnic minorities.

Geerxia (Mongolian), Deputy Secretary of the CPC Bortala Autonomous Prefecture Committee, pointed out in his speech: The fallacy of "ethnic assimilation" is the poison released by local nationalists to incite backward masses to exclude the Han nationality and oppose the leadership of the Party. The assimilation that Marxists want to oppose is the ethnic assimilation that is carried out under class rule, ethnic oppression, and ethnic coercion, so that one ethnic group rides on the heads of another ethnic group. Our Party is precisely opposed to this kind of assimilation and leads the Chinese people to forever eliminate its social roots, namely the exploiting classes. Therefore, raising the so-called "assimilation" issue under today's circumstances is aimed at opposing socialism and opposing the mutual approach and political, economic, and cultural exchanges between ethnic groups.

Cao Danov (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, said in his speech: Local nationalists are deliberately shouting that "the main contradiction in Xinjiang is the ethnic contradiction," and in essence, they are attempting to split the motherland, separate Xinjiang from socialist society, and establish a so-called "independent" "republic," saying that this is the way to solve the ethnic issue.

Yu Zhanlin (Hui), Deputy Procurator-General of the Autonomous Region's Supreme People's Procuratorate, said: I am an ethnic minority cadre, and also a member of the various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. I deeply know the disasters that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have experienced in the old era. The local nationalists' reactionary activities of attempting to split Xinjiang from the motherland are resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang cannot leave the Chinese Communist Party, cannot leave the motherland, and cannot leave the Han people. Without the Communist Party, the motherland, and the Han people, Xinjiang would not be liberated. For the liberation of Xinjiang, many loyal soldiers of the Party have worked hard together with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and carried out a long-term struggle against the enemy. Chen Tanqiu, one of the founders of the Party and a member of the Central Committee, Mao Zemin and Lin Jilu, outstanding members of the Party, shed their last drop of blood on the enemy's execution ground. It was not until 1949 that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were liberated from the abyss of misery under the leadership of the Party. The years after liberation have proved that it would not have been possible to achieve such great construction achievements in the autonomous region today without the help of the Party, the motherland, and the Han people.

In their speeches, the Party cadres of all ethnic groups exposed and criticized the various reactionary words and deeds of the local nationalists point by point, and thoroughly crushed the attack of the local nationalists against the Party and against socialism. At the same time, through this meeting, the major issues of right and wrong between socialism and capitalism were clarified, so that the 381 responsible Party cadres of various ethnic groups attending the meeting received a profound Marxist-Leninist education and test and exercise in political and ideological struggle, and improved their awareness, thereby further enhancing the unity of the entire Party in the autonomous region on the basis of Marxist-Leninist unanimity. The cadres of all ethnic groups attending the meeting generally reflected: "Attending such a meeting is equivalent to entering a political university."

 坚持两条道路的斗争
 Adhere to the Struggle of Two Roads
 贯彻马克思、列宁主义的路线
 Implement the Marxist-Leninist Line
 反对资产阶级民族主义的路线
 Oppose the Bourgeois Nationalist Line

After extensive debate, the meeting held that the struggle against local nationalism that has been launched is the struggle between the Party's Marxist-Leninist line for solving ethnic problems and the bourgeois nationalist line; it is also the struggle between two roads: upholding national unity and opposing national unity, upholding ethnic solidarity and opposing ethnic solidarity, upholding the leadership of the Party and opposing the leadership of the Party. Therefore, whether this struggle can achieve victory is related to national unity, ethnic solidarity, socialist construction in Xinjiang, and the future and destiny of the five million people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, carrying out the struggle against local nationalism is a serious task on the current political and ideological front in the autonomous region.

The meeting pointed out that although the local nationalists in the autonomous region are attacking the Party and socialism in a wide range and involving many issues, they are particularly prominent and serious in the following five major issues:

(1) The issue of national unity. Our Party upholds national unity and opposes separatism, while local nationalists oppose national unity and advocate separatism. They organize small groups to carry out sectarian activities, put forward reactionary programs, and want to establish an "independent republic" or a "republic of the union," and want to change the "autonomous region" to "East Turkestan." Some even hope that the international situation will be tense and a Hungarian incident will occur in the country, so that Xinjiang can achieve "independence." This reactionary behavior of local nationalists attempting to split Xinjiang from the socialist motherland, which has already realized the people's democratic dictatorship and is carrying out socialist construction, is harmful to the proletariat and beneficial to the bourgeoisie, and harmful to socialism and beneficial to imperialism. They shout for "independence" and want to split from the socialist motherland. This is clearly standing on the position of the bourgeois right-wing to oppose the proletariat and oppose socialism, but they pretend to be Marxist-Leninist, which makes them even more insidious and malicious. The meeting pointed out that our great motherland must be unified, otherwise, it would be a historical regression and reaction. Xinjiang has long been an inseparable part of the territory of the motherland, but local nationalists deliberately oppose Xinjiang to the motherland, treating Xinjiang as an "independent country." This is a reactionary ideology that is anti-historical, anti-realistic, anti-motherland, anti-people, and anti-socialist.

(2) The issue of ethnic solidarity. Our Party upholds ethnic solidarity and opposes ethnic division, while local nationalists oppose ethnic solidarity and advocate ethnic division. Their program is to exclude the Han nationality. They say that the autonomous region is the autonomous region of the Uyghur ethnic group, oppose cadres of other ethnic groups from holding Party and government leadership positions, want to drive away or relocate the Han people, and try their best to oppose Han cadres and Han people from coming to Xinjiang. Some viciously attack the Production and Construction Corps, obliterate their great contribution to the economic construction of the autonomous region, and distort the friendly relationship between the Production Corps and the peasants into "armed peasants having contradictions with unarmed peasants," and so on. The meeting pointed out that after the national liberation, our country has eliminated ethnic oppression politically and achieved ethnic equality. After the victory of democratic reform and socialist transformation, class exploitation was eliminated, and a socialist economic foundation was established. This is the fundamental reason why ethnic oppression and ethnic inequality cannot occur in our country. This is the superiority of a socialist country. The meeting pointed out that Marxists and Leninists have always believed that ethnic oppression comes from the exploiting classes, and the class interests of the working class and working people of all ethnic groups are the same. They are brothers and sisters, and they resolutely oppose the exploiting classes in their own ethnic groups oppressing other ethnic groups. However, local nationalists regard the entire Han nationality as the enemy. Regarding the relationship between the Han nationality and the ethnic minorities, they deliberately publicize the antagonistic side of the Han nationality and the ethnic minorities in history, but are unwilling to publicize the friendly cooperation between the Han nationality and the ethnic minorities in history. They cannot see or are unwilling to see the fundamental changes in the current ethnic relations, and are unwilling to publicize the moving examples of new ethnic solidarity, but shout loudly "can't get along with all these Han people." This can only show that they are speaking on behalf of the landlords and the bourgeoisie; at the same time, it also exposes how they are looking for all kinds of excuses to split and undermine ethnic solidarity in a despicable and ugly way.

(3) The issue of people's democratic dictatorship. Our Party adheres to the people's democratic dictatorship, while local nationalists try their best to weaken and undermine the people's democratic dictatorship, attempting to restore the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. They have deep sympathy for the counter-revolutionaries who organized riots, saying they were "the people's 'just' actions"; they harbor and unconditionally release counter-revolutionaries, and even install landlords, rich peasants, bad elements, and counter-revolutionaries into state organs and enterprises, institutions, and schools. On the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they attack the Party and the state's suppression of counter-revolutionary policies, try their best to obliterate achievements, exaggerate shortcomings, and defend bad elements who undermine socialist order in many ways. All of these illustrate the anti-Party and anti-people stance of the local nationalists.

(4) The issue of taking the socialist road. Over the past few years, the Party organization of the autonomous region has correctly carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction, and has achieved great results, winning the warm support of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. However, local nationalists violate the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups and oppose socialist transformation and socialist construction. They say that there are contradictions between cooperation and land issues in Xinjiang, and it is impossible to develop a socialist economy, saying that cooperation is a copy of the experience of the Han nationality areas, and does not take into account the so-called "ethnic traditions and ethnic characteristics." They also obliterate all the great achievements of the vigorous development of industry, agriculture, and cultural education in the autonomous region, and even frantically attack and slander them. Their purpose is clearly to abolish socialism and restore capitalism. The meeting held that achievements cannot be obliterated, and the socialist road has long been affirmed by the people of the whole country. Any ethnic group, if it does not take the socialist road, can never get rid of backwardness and poverty, and it is impossible for its ethnic group to be truly liberated. This is a historical fact that has already been proven.

(5) The issue of Party leadership. We believe that the leadership of the Party is the basic guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution. The Party is the leading core for uniting the people of all ethnic groups in the country to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Any weakening of the Party's leadership and undermining of the Party's unity and unification will cause serious harm to the great revolutionary cause and construction cause of the people of all ethnic groups. In order to achieve the goals of splitting the Party, changing the nature of the Party, and usurping the leadership of the Party, the local nationalists have slandered that "the Party has become the Party of the Han people" and "Marxism is monopolized by one ethnic group," carried out anti-Party sectarian activities, excluded Han nationality leading comrades in the Party organization, attacked ethnic minority leading comrades who adhered to the Party's policies, and even openly opposed the Marxist-Leninist principles of Party building, proposing that the Party committee should also be ethnicized. The meeting exposed the despicable conspiracy of the local nationalists, severely criticized the reactionary view of dividing Party organizations by ethnic composition, smashed the anti-Party sectarian activities, defended the Marxist-Leninist principles of Party building, and safeguarded the unity and solidarity of the Party.

 应该吸取的重要教训
 Important Lessons That Should Be Learned
 坚决进行斗争，克服民族主义的倾向
 Resolutely Carry Out Struggle, Overcome the Tendency of Nationalism
 克服个人主义，建立共产主义干部队伍
 Overcome Individualism, Establish a Communist Cadre Contingent

The meeting also analyzed the roots of local nationalism and the main lessons that should be learned. Local nationalists believe that "there is no local nationalism without great-ethnic chauvinism," as if local nationalism is a product of great-ethnic chauvinism. Their conclusion is: "Overcoming great-ethnic chauvinism will naturally overcome local nationalism." The meeting held that this statement is very absurd. Facts have proven that overcoming great-ethnic chauvinism does not mean overcoming local nationalism, and not having Han chauvinism does not mean not having local nationalism. Whether it is great-ethnic chauvinism or local nationalism, its roots are the bourgeoisie, the exploiting classes. Therefore, when looking for the roots of local nationalism, we can only look from the aspects of the bourgeoisie and the exploiting classes, and not from other aspects.

The meeting held that the main lessons learned in this struggle against local nationalism are: (1) Whether it is opposing great-ethnic chauvinism or opposing local nationalism, we should resolutely carry out the struggle when this tendency is not serious. Otherwise, a tendency that was not originally a major danger may develop into a major danger. (2) Bourgeois individualism must be overcome. Failure to overcome it will easily develop into bourgeois nationalism. To overcome bourgeois individualism, it is necessary to carry out ideological transformation, especially for those intellectual cadres who come from the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, who need to seize self-ideological transformation. People with bourgeois individualism are often not humble and cannot be criticized; they do not listen to the Party, but want the Party to listen to them, and do not take the opinions of the Party organization as their own, but take their own opinions as their own. This problem must be resolutely overcome. (3) While opposing local nationalism, we must oppose liberalism. We should always adhere to the principles of the Party and the spirit of Marxism-Leninism in everything, and we must resolutely struggle against words and deeds that violate the principles of the Party and the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. (4) Through this struggle against local nationalism, we have further understood the cadres, and at the same time, we have further realized the serious significance of the Party's need to build a communist cadre contingent that can withstand risks. It also shows that Party cadres must be absolutely loyal to the Party and loyal to the cause of communism. We must adhere to the Party's cadre policy of "both moral integrity and ability," with moral integrity being the first and ability being the second. First of all, we must pay attention to good moral integrity. In the future, we must never ignore this point in the work of training ethnic minority cadres. (5) The reason why local nationalism is serious is not because of the general cadres, but because of the leading cadres. Therefore, strengthening ideological work among the ethnic minority leading cadres, improving their Marxist-Leninist level, and overcoming local nationalism is of particular importance.

The meeting reminded all Han cadres working in Xinjiang that they must never ignore the opposition to Han chauvinism when carrying out the struggle against local nationalism.

Before the end of the meeting, Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, gave a summary report to the meeting entitled "Struggle for the Marxist-Leninist Line of the Party in Solving Ethnic Problems." The meeting finally adopted a resolution on overcoming local nationalism and a resolution on expelling Ziya Samet, Iblayin Tuerdi, Abudureyim Aisa, A. Sayed, Abulizi Kari and others from the Party for being right-wing elements within the Party.

    新疆维吾尔自治区党委扩大会议坚持马克思列宁主义路线
    彻底打垮地方民族主义分子的进攻
    对巩固祖国统一和各民族团结、加强党的思想建设和促进新疆社会主义事业发展有重大意义
    新华社乌鲁木齐26日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会在最近时期内举行了有自治区、自治州、专区、县的党员负责干部三百八十一人参加的扩大会议。在会议上经过长时间的充分的讨论，取得反对地方民族主义斗争的决定性胜利，对于巩固祖国统一和各民族团结、加强党的思想建设和促进新疆社会主义事业发展，有着重大的意义。
    会议在听取自治区党委书记赛福鼎同志“坚决反对地方民族主义，为社会主义的伟大胜利而奋斗”的报告（按：这个报告已在去年12月26日人民日报发表）以后，结合这一报告认真学习和讨论了党的八届三中全会上邓小平同志“关于整风运动的报告”和中央关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育的指示。会议采用大鸣大放和出大字报等方法，对新疆党内当前存在的主要的危险倾向——地方民族主义，进行了严肃的激烈的斗争。在大会上发言的同志们，首先以大量事实驳倒了地方民族主义分子右派分子向党进攻的一切谰言，肯定了党在新疆八年来所取得的伟大成就；对于隐藏在党内的右派分子、地方民族主义分子自治区文化厅厅长、文化厅党分组书记、自治区文联主席、作家协会自治区分会主席孜牙·赛买提，自治区民政厅厅长、民政厅党分组书记、作家协会自治区分会副主席依不拉音吐尔的，自治区党委候补委员、伊犁哈萨克族自治州副州长阿不都热依木·艾沙和地方民族主义分子、阶级异己分子乌鲁木齐市市长阿·赛德，自治区商业厅副厅长阿不列孜·卡里，进行了坚决的斗争，并把他们清除出党；对于一些犯有严重的地方民族主义错误的人，都进行了认真的批判，并根据各人所犯错误的情节轻重和交代、悔改的表现，分别作了严肃的处理。由于批判和斗争的逐步深入，有些在会议刚开始时抱自由主义、温情主义态度的人也改变了态度，会上涌现出大批的积极分子。
    各族党员负责干部发言
    彻底揭露和批判地方民族主义分子的罪行
    坚决反对把新疆从祖国大家庭中分裂出去
    在这次会议上，先后发言的达一千二百七十八人次。发言的同志大部分都是本地各民族的党员负责干部。他们对地方民族主义分子破坏祖国统一、分裂民族团结的反动罪行，进行了无情的揭露和批判。
    自治区公安厅第三处处长安尼瓦尔·沙力江（哈萨克族）说：地方民族主义分子披着民族外衣，把自己装扮成民族的代表者和保护者，制造民族之间和本民族各阶层之间的对立仇视。他们为了满足个人贪得无厌的要求，以至有的人不惜把民族的利益出卖给帝国主义。因此，他们和已往民族中的败类没有什么不同之处。地方民族主义分子对我国民族区域自治政策的污蔑，以及所提出的建立共和国的要求，实质上是想取消无产阶级专政，建立资产阶级专政。
    自治区计划委员会副主任努斯热提（维吾尔族）在发言中说：地方民族主义分子阿·赛德等人造谣说，党没有重视提拔和培养民族干部。事实是怎样呢？乌鲁木齐市的民族党员由1951年的二十七名到1957年已发展到六百零八名，增加了二十二倍。中共乌鲁木齐市委员会二十三个委员中，39％是少数民族。
    中共博尔塔拉自治州委员会副书记格尔夏（蒙古族）在发言中指出：“民族被同化”的谬论是地方民族主义分子煽动落后群众排斥汉族、反对党的领导时放出的毒素。马克思主义者所要反对的同化，是在阶级统治下实行民族压迫、民族强制，使一个民族骑在另一个民族头上的那种民族同化。我们党正是反对这种同化，并且领导中国人民永远消灭它的社会根源即剥削阶级。因此，在今天的情况下提出所谓“同化”的问题，其目的是反对社会主义，反对各民族互相接近，进行政治、经济和文化交流。
    新疆军区政治部副主任曹达诺夫（维吾尔族）在发言中说：地方民族主义分子别有用心地叫喊“新疆的主要矛盾是民族矛盾”，实质上是企图分裂祖国，把新疆从社会主义社会中分离出来，建立所谓“独立”的“共和国”，说这样才算解决民族问题。
    自治区最高人民检察院副检察长禹占林（回族）说：我是一个少数民族干部，也是新疆各少数民族中的一员，我深知旧时代新疆各族人民所经受过的灾难。地方民族主义分子企图把新疆从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的反动活动，是我们新疆各民族人民所坚决反对的。新疆各族人民是不能离开中国共产党，不能离开祖国，也不能离开汉族人民的。没有共产党、祖国、汉族人民，新疆就不会解放。为了新疆的解放，党的不少忠诚战士，曾和新疆各族人民一道艰苦奋斗，向敌人进行了长期的斗争，党的创始人之一，中央委员陈潭秋，党的优秀党员毛泽民、林基路等同志，在敌人的刑场上流出了最后一滴血，直到1949年新疆各族人民在党的领导下从水深火热中解放出来。解放后几年来又证明：没有党、祖国和汉族人民的帮助，要取得今天自治区这样巨大的建设成就也是不可能的。
    各民族党员干部在发言中，对地方民族主义分子的各种反动言行逐点进行了揭露和批判，彻底打垮了地方民族主义分子向党向社会主义的进攻。同时，通过这次会议，辩明了社会主义和资本主义的大是大非，使到会的三百八十一名各民族的党员负责干部，受到一次深刻的马克思列宁主义教育和政治思想斗争的考验与锻炼，提高了觉悟，从而使自治区全党在马列主义一致的基础上进一步增强了团结。到会的各民族干部普遍反映：“参加这样的会议等于进了一次政治大学”。
    坚持两条道路的斗争
    贯彻马克思、列宁主义的路线
    反对资产阶级民族主义的路线经过大辩论，会议认为，这次所开展的反对地方民族主义的斗争，是党的解决民族问题的马克思列宁主义路线和资产阶级民族主义的路线的斗争；同时也是拥护国家统一和反对国家统一、拥护民族团结和反对民族团结、拥护党的领导和反对党的领导的两条道路的斗争。因此，这场斗争能否取得胜利，关系着祖国统一，关系着各民族团结，关系着新疆社会主义建设和五百万各族人民的前途与命运。因而开展反对地方民族主义的斗争，是自治区当前政治战线和思想战线上的一个严重任务。
    会议指出，自治区地方民族主义分子向党、向社会主义进攻的方面虽然很广泛，涉及的问题很多，但是在以下五个重大问题上却表现得特别突出和严重：
    （一）祖国统一问题。我们党是维护祖国统一和反对分离主义的，而地方民族主义分子却反对祖国统一，主张分离主义。他们组织小集团进行宗派活动，提出反动纲领，要成立“独立的共和国”或“加盟共和国”，要将“自治区”改为“维吾尔斯坦”或“东土耳其斯坦”，有的甚至还盼望国际形势紧张，国内发生匈牙利事件，使新疆得到“独立”。地方民族主义分子这种企图把新疆从已经实现了人民民主专政和正在进行社会主义建设的祖国大家庭中分裂出去的反动行为，是有害于无产阶级而有利于资产阶级、有害于社会主义而有利于帝国主义的。他们高喊要“独立”，要从社会主义祖国分裂出去，这明明是站在资产阶级右派的立场上反对无产阶级，反对社会主义，而他们却伪装成马列主义，这就显得更加阴险和恶毒。会议指出，我们伟大的祖国是必须统一的，如果不这样，就是历史的倒退和反动。新疆长期以来就是祖国领土的不可分割的一部分，但地方民族主义分子却故意把新疆和祖国对立起来，把新疆作为一个“独立国家”，这是反历史、反现实、反祖国、反人民、反社会主义的反动思想。
    （二）民族团结问题。我们党是拥护民族团结和反对民族分裂的，而地方民族主义分子却反对民族团结，主张民族分裂，他们的纲领是排斥汉族。他们说自治区是维吾尔族的自治区，反对其他民族的干部担任党政领导工作，要把汉人赶走或迁走，并想尽方法反对汉族干部和汉族群众到新疆来。有的恶毒地攻击生产建设兵团，抹煞他们对自治区经济建设的巨大贡献，把生产兵团同农民团结友好的关系歪曲为“武装的农民同非武装的农民有矛盾”等等。会议指出，全国解放后，我国在政治上已经消灭了民族压迫，实现了民族平等。民主改革和社会主义改造胜利后，消灭了阶级剥削，建立了社会主义经济基础，这就是我们国家不可能出现民族压迫和民族不平等的根本原因。这是社会主义国家的优越性。会议指出，马列主义者向来认为民族压迫是来自剥削阶级，各民族的工人阶级和劳动人民的阶级利益是一致的，他们是亲兄亲弟，他们坚决反对自己民族中的剥削阶级压迫其他的民族。但地方民族主义者却把整个汉族看成是敌人。他们对于汉族和少数民族人民的关系，别有用心地去宣扬历史上汉族和少数民族对立的一面，而不愿宣扬历史上汉族和少数民族友好合作的一面。他们看不到也不愿看到现在各民族关系的根本变化，不愿宣扬新的民族团结的动人事例，却大喊大叫什么“和所有这些汉族人搞不到一起”。这只能说明他们是代表着地主、资产阶级在说话；同时，也暴露了他们是如何寻找一切借口来分裂、破坏民族团结的卑鄙丑恶的面目。
    （三）人民民主专政问题。我们党是坚持人民民主专政的，而地方民族主义分子却是想尽一切方法削弱和破坏人民民主专政，企图使封建阶级和资产阶级复辟。他们对于反革命分子组织暴乱寄予深厚同情，说是“人民的‘正义’行动”；他们包庇和无原则地释放反革命分子，甚至把地主、富农、坏分子和反革命分子安插到国家机关和企业、事业、学校内部。在镇压反革命问题上，攻击党和国家的镇反政策，竭力抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，对破坏社会主义秩序的坏分子多方辩护。这些都说明了地方民族主义分子的反党、反人民立场。
    （四）走社会主义道路的问题。自治区党组织几年来正确地进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，并取得了巨大成果，获得了新疆各族人民的热烈拥护。地方民族主义分子却违背各族人民的愿望，反对社会主义改造和社会主义建设。他们说新疆合作化与土地问题有矛盾，不可能搞起社会主义经济，说合作化是搬用了汉族地区的经验，没有照顾所谓“民族传统和民族特点”。他们对于自治区工业、农业和文化教育等事业蓬勃发展的巨大成就也一概抹煞，甚至疯狂地进行攻击和诬蔑，其目的显然是要取消社会主义，恢复资本主义。会议认为，成绩是抹煞不了的，社会主义道路是全国人民早已肯定了的。任何一个民族，如果不走社会主义道路，就决不可能使自己摆脱落后、贫困的境地，也就不可能使自己的民族真正得到解放。这是历史事实已经证明了的。
    （五）党的领导问题。我们认为党的领导是中国革命取得胜利的基本保证。党是团结全国各民族人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导核心，任何削弱党的领导、破坏党的团结和统一，都会对各族人民的伟大革命事业和建设事业造成严重危害。而地方民族主义分子为了达到分裂党、改变党的性质、篡夺党的领导的目的，竟污蔑：“党成了汉族人的党”、“马克思主义被一个民族来独占了”，进行反党宗派活动，在党的组织内排斥汉族领导同志，打击坚持党的政策的少数民族领导同志，甚至公然反对马列主义的建党的原则，提出党委也要民族化。会议揭穿了地方民族主义分子的卑鄙阴谋，严厉批判了以民族成分划分党的组织的反动观点，粉碎了反党的宗派活动，捍卫马列主义的建党原则，维护党的统一和团结。
    应该吸取的重要教训
    坚决进行斗争，克服民族主义的倾向
    克服个人主义，建立共产主义干部队伍
    会议还分析了地方民族主义产生的根源和应该吸取的主要教训。地方民族主义分子认为，“没有大民族主义便没有地方民族主义”，好像地方民族主义是大民族主义的产物。他们的结论是：“克服了大民族主义，就自然而然地克服了地方民族主义”。会议认为，这种说法是十分荒谬的。事实证明，克服了大民族主义并不等于就克服了地方民族主义，没有大汉族主义并不等于就没有地方民族主义。不管是大民族主义还是地方民族主义，其产生的根源是资产阶级，是剥削阶级。因此，在找地方民族主义的根源时，只能从资产阶级、剥削阶级的方面去找，而不能从别的方面去找。
    会议认为，在这次反对地方民族主义的斗争中得到的主要教训是：（1）不论是反对大民族主义或是反对地方民族主义，都应该在这种倾向还不严重的时候，就坚决进行斗争。否则，本来不是主要的危险的倾向，就有可能发展为主要的危险的倾向。（2）资产阶级个人主义必须克服，不克服就容易发展成为资产阶级民族主义。而要克服资产阶级个人主义，就必须进行思想改造，特别是那些地主阶级和资产阶级出身的知识分子干部，更需要抓紧自我思想改造。有资产阶级个人主义的人，常常很不虚心，批评不得；他们不听党的话，而要党听他的话，不以党组织的意见为意见，而以自己的意见为意见。这个毛病要坚决克服。（3）在反对地方民族主义同时，必须反对自由主义。应该事事坚持党的原则和马克思列宁主义精神，对于违犯党的原则和马克思列宁主义精神的言行，必须坚决进行斗争。（4）经过这次反对地方民族主义的斗争，使我们进一步了解了干部，同时使我们进一步认识党要建立一支经得起风险的共产主义的干部队伍的严重意义。同时也说明，党的干部一定要绝对忠实于党，忠实于共产主义事业。我们一定要坚持“德才兼备”的党的干部政策，德是第一，才是第二，首先要注意德好。今后在培养少数民族干部工作中绝不可忽视这一条。（5）地方民族主义其所以严重，不在于一般干部，而在于领导干部。因此，在少数民族的领导干部中，加强思想工作，提高马列主义水平，克服地方民族主义有特别重大的意义。
    会议提醒所有在新疆工作的汉族干部，在开展反对地方民族主义斗争的时候，绝对不能忽视反对大汉族主义。
