    Friendship's Support
    We are a new silkworm breeding area. In response to the Party's call to develop a diversified economy, we opened a mulberry garden in January last year and planted 50,000 mulberry seedlings. That year, we raised silkworms from twenty-one and a half sheets of silkworm eggs in the autumn. This year, we transformed a creek bank full of rocks and thorns into a mulberry garden and planted 36,000 new mulberry trees. We raised silkworms from twenty-four sheets of silkworm eggs in the spring.
    As the silkworms grew bigger, their appetite also increased. They needed to eat six times a day, consuming about 2,000 catties of mulberry leaves each time. Just at that moment, there was a sudden shortage of mulberry leaves. The leaves on the mulberry trees planted last year had been completely cut off, and even the little tender leaves on the new mulberry seedlings planted this year were cut off, but the silkworms were still hungry.
    Just when we were facing serious difficulties that could not be solved, the neighboring brother agricultural cooperatives timely sold us their surplus mulberry leaves, allowing us to smoothly overcome the difficulties. We are very grateful for their great class friendship. In particular, we want to thank the female members of the Shangma Cooperative and the Jiashanxia Cooperative in Xiangnian Township of this district. As soon as they heard the district party committee's mobilization, they immediately cut off a large number of mulberry leaves and sent them from more than twenty miles away with gongs and drums to support us.
    Through this spring silkworm rearing, we have further deeply realized the greatness of the Party. Only in a socialist society under the leadership of the Communist Party can our people unite so closely and support each other throughout the country.　　　　　Silkworm Breeding Group of the Garden Cooperative, Linhai, Zhejiang

    友谊的支援
    我们这里是个新蚕桑区。为了响应党关于发展多种经济的号召，去年1月开辟了一个桑园，种下了五万株桑苗。当年我们便养了二十一张半蚕纸的秋蚕。今年又把一个满是乱石刺丛的溪滩改造成一个桑园，种下了三万六千株新桑。养了二十四张蚕纸的春蚕。
    蚕儿越养越大，食量也越来越大，一天要吃六次，每次要吃桑叶二千来斤。就在这个时候，突然桑叶不够了。去年种的桑树上的叶子给剪光了，今年才栽下的新桑苗上的一点点嫩叶也都剪来了，蚕儿还是挨饿。
    正当面临严重困难无法解决时，邻近各兄弟农业社及时把多余的桑叶卖给我们，使我们顺利渡过难关。对他们这种伟大的阶级友爱，我们非常感激。特别要感谢本区香年乡上马社和假山下社的女社员们，她们一听到区委动员，马上剪下大批桑叶，从二十多里外面敲锣打鼓送来支援我们。
    通过这次养春蚕，我们更进一步深深体会到党的伟大，只有在共产党领导下的社会主义社会，才能使我们全国人民这样紧密地互相团结，互相支援。　　　　　浙江临海花园社蚕桑组
