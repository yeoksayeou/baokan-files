Following the Road of Pinggu

Kong Sang

The experience of Pinggu County, Hebei Province, in mobilizing the masses to explore, mine, and smelt non-ferrous metals points out a path for developing the non-ferrous metal industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Non-ferrous metals have many varieties, are distributed relatively scattered, and their reserves are not as large as those of ferrous metals. Therefore, in the minds of most people, exploration, mining, and smelting require relatively high technology and are not something that ordinary people can handle. Precisely because of this reason, when the whole country broke the mysterious concept of industrial construction, and the whole party and the whole people were enthusiastically running local industries, people were still somewhat superstitious about the exploitation and smelting of non-ferrous metal industries, and they did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses to engage in it. Now, that's great. More than 5,000 farmers and cadres in Pinggu County, Hebei Province, under the leadership of the County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, broke superstition and unveiled the secrets of developing non-ferrous metal mines: like other industries, the vast number of farmers and cadres who have not received special training can also explore, mine, and smelt non-ferrous metals, and achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Without spending a penny of the state's money, they can produce 5,000 tons of copper this year, which is equivalent to the output of the Shouwangfen Copper Mine, which took more than two years and cost the state 40 million yuan to build. In addition, they will also produce 10,000 taels of gold, as well as many non-ferrous metals such as lead and zinc. Hebei Province is promoting the experience of Pinggu County and plans to produce more than 61,000 tons of copper, more than 30,000 tons of lead and zinc, and 120,000 taels of gold and silver this year. This is truly a remarkable plan. In the past, Hebei Province, which was always considered to have very few non-ferrous metal deposits, has thoroughly implemented the Party's mass line and mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses, and can quickly achieve such outstanding results. If all parts of the country, especially those with rich non-ferrous metal reserves, also do this, wouldn't the face of my country's non-ferrous metal industry be quickly changed?

Non-ferrous metals are important resources for modern industry. The metallurgical industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, and the national defense industry all need non-ferrous metals. It can be said that without the non-ferrous metal industry, there would be no modern industry. My country's reserves of non-ferrous metals are among the richest in the world. However, at present, my country's non-ferrous metal industry is still very backward, and the variety and output are far from meeting the needs of the rapidly developing industry. Developing the non-ferrous metal industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way is an important task for the Chinese people in developing industry. We should break superstitions like Pinggu County, Hebei Province, mobilize the masses, and enthusiastically explore, mine, and smelt non-ferrous metals, and strive to fundamentally change the backward face of my country's non-ferrous metal industry in a relatively short period of time.

Let the advanced experience created by Pinggu County blossom and bear fruit all over the country!

    走平谷的道路
    孔桑
    河北省平谷县发动群众勘探、开采和冶炼有色金属的经验，给我们指出了一条多快好省地发展有色金属工业的道路。
    有色金属品种多，分布比较分散，蕴藏量也没有黑色金属那样大，所以在一般人的心目中，勘探、开采和冶炼都需要比较高的技术，不是一般凡人所能胜任的。正是因为这个缘故，当全国各地打破了工业建设的神秘观念，全党全民轰轰烈烈地大办地方工业的时候，人们对有色金属工业的开采和冶炼仍有些迷信，不敢大胆发动群众去搞。现在好了，河北省平谷县五千多农民和干部，在中共县委会的领导下，破除迷信，揭开了开发有色金属矿山的秘密：像其它工业一样，没有经过专门训练的广大农民和干部也能勘探、开采和冶炼有色金属，而且达到真正的多快好省的要求。他们不花国家一文，今年就可以生产五千吨铜，相当于国家投资四千万元、历时两年多才建成的寿王坟铜矿的产量。此外，他们还要生产一万两黄金以及铅锌等许多有色金属。河北省推广平谷县的经验，要在今年内生产铜六万一千多吨，铅、锌等三万多吨，金、银十二万两。这真是一个很了不起的计划。过去一向被认为有色金属矿藏很少的河北省，认真贯彻了党的群众路线，发动了群众的积极性，就能迅速地做出这样出色的成绩，要是全国各地，特别是那些有色金属蕴藏丰富的地方也这样做，我国有色金属工业的面貌，不是很快就可以改观吗？
    有色金属是近代工业的重要资源。冶金工业、机械制造工业、国防工业都少不了有色金属。可以说，没有有色金属工业就没有近代工业。我国有色金属的蕴藏量之丰富是世界上少有的，但是，目前我国有色金属工业还很落后，品种和产量都远远不能满足一日千里地发展着的工业的需要。多快好省地发展有色金属工业，是我国人民在发展工业中的一项重要任务。我们应该像河北省平谷县一样破除迷信，发动群众，轰轰烈烈地勘探、开采和冶炼有色金属，争取在比较短的时间内根本改变我国有色金属工业的落后面貌。
    让平谷县创造的先进经验，在全国各地开花结果！
