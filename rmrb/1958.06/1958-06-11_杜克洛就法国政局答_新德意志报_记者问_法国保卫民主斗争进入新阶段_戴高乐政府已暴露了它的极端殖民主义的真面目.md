Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 9th: "Neues Deutschland" published an interview with Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, by the newspaper.

Duclos said: As a result of some events, General de Gaulle obtained the power of Prime Minister from the National Assembly on June 1st. I would like to briefly talk about these events here.

On May 13th, Pflimlin, entrusted by the President of the Republic to organize a new government, requested the National Assembly to grant him full powers as Prime Minister. On the same day, some extremely emotional colonialists in Algeria, with the support of the army, launched a riot. They occupied the Algerian Affairs Department (a French government agency) and claimed to oppose Pflimlin's cabinet formation, while demanding that a government be organized in France according to their opinions. They also insisted that they demanded a government headed by General de Gaulle.

When riots began in Algeria, rebellious military and political personnel, with the support of some troops, began to plot a rebellion in Paris. They were able to count on the support of these troops, especially because "branches" had been established in the army under the leadership of the notorious Gaullist, former Minister of Defense Chaban-Delmas.

In view of this situation, the government of the Republic should rely on the working class and the masses and express its determination.

However, the Pflimlin government established on May 13th chose a different path.

The French Communist Party allowed this government to be established in order to end the government crisis, because the rebels were taking advantage of the government crisis to speculate and attempting to extend the riots in Algeria to Paris. The Pflimlin government originally had the necessary means to control the political situation, but it showed weakness, repeatedly surrendered, and even refused to initially accuse those responsible for the Algerian events in the National Assembly. The government did not even dare to condemn the soldiers who rioted.

During these events, General de Gaulle told reporters on May 15th that he was prepared to assume full power of the Republic. This was nothing more than an echo of the demands of the Algerian rioters.

De Gaulle's statement made the Republicans uneasy, and they saw a "military coup" in it.

Duclos then answered questions from reporters.

Q: The characteristic of a "military coup" is that the army opposes the current regime. What consequences did the riots in Algeria have for France, and how did the masses react to this matter?

A: The call to "let the army rule" issued from Algeria was reflected in the activities of some military and political rioters in France (including General Chassin), who also made similar demands.

Because he didn't dare to risk a military riot, De Gaulle preferred to rely on the threat of a military riot to seize power under the guise of legality. That is to say, he did not violently expel the parliamentarians like Napoleon III's coup on December 2, 1851, but exerted strong pressure on the parliamentarians and used their anti-communist prejudice to force a majority of parliamentarians to recognize De Gaulle's rule.

However, these activities could not have succeeded without certain assistance, such as that of Mollet. Mollet gave General de Gaulle the opportunity he wanted to hold a press conference on May 19th. At this press conference, in order to weaken the resistance of the Republicans, he sang some "reassuring" tunes.

When General de Gaulle's henchmen began to disintegrate the morale of the Republican parliamentarians, the French Communist Party did its best to prevent the disintegration of morale, first of all by uniting all the forces of the working class and the Republicans to act together.

On the day General de Gaulle held a press conference, tens of thousands of Parisians began to strike to show their will to defend the Republic.

Just as the separatists stepped up their pressure, and the working class and forces with Republican sentiments launched a struggle, the government retreated. On the night of May 26th, Pflimlin, in a secret negotiation with General de Gaulle, declared that he was ready to give the position of Prime Minister to De Gaulle.

This surrender occurred when the will of the people to defend the Republic developed into a large-scale demonstration. The following facts show this: on May 27th, strikes broke out in Paris and the provinces, and on May 28th, 500,000 Parisians held a large-scale demonstration. They marched from the Place de la Nation to the Place de la République. Participants included communists, socialists, radical socialists, Catholics and other democrats; the movement of the broad masses of the people became stronger day by day, while the supporters of personal dictatorship were increasingly in difficulty.

On the eve of the powerful demonstration, General de Gaulle said that he was "taking the legal path to establish a Republican government." On the night of May 27th, Pflimlin submitted his resignation despite the support of the majority.

Q: Did the serious consequences of the activities of those who created divisions within the working class and the working masses play a decisive role in this turn of events?

A: Since the Pflimlin government surrendered, the road has been greatly opened for the Colombey-les-Deux-Églises (Editor's note: De Gaulle's residence) elements, but there will inevitably still be resistance at home and in parliament. In particular, it is necessary to strive to divide the Socialist Party parliamentary group, because the vast majority of them are against De Gaulle. For this purpose, General de Gaulle must be dressed up as a "Republican supporter who respects democratic freedom." This is what Mollet and former President of the Republic Auriol did, and they cleared the way for the would-be dictator to a certain extent.

It was in this way that General de Gaulle was granted the power of Prime Minister by 329 votes to 224 votes, with 42 Socialist Party members voting in favor and 49 voting against.

The activities of those who tried to divide the working class and democratic forces opened a gap in a particularly vulnerable place, that is, in the parliament, through which De Gaulle could seize power under the guise of complying with the law. At the same time, despicable pressure also contributed to this, with the President of the Republic being the first to set this precedent.

The splitters and their lackeys launched a real war of nerves in order to prepare the conditions for surrender, while the Communist Party, a firm defender of Republican freedom, opposed this surrender.

From all this, it can be seen that the composition of the De Gaulle government was only carried out under a legal guise. In fact, it was the product of the riots in Algeria and Ajaccio, as well as the shameful surrender of the Pflimlin government and the betrayal of Mollet, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, who was willing to act as a tool of personal dictatorship.

Q: What preliminary lessons can be learned from this event?

A: First of all, workers and democrats can be sure that anti-communist sentiment was not only used by the rioters during this event, but was used by them long before.

There is no doubt that the root of the current situation should be found in the policies that have been frequently implemented by the majority controlled by Mollet and Binet for eleven years, both of whom are now participating in the new government.

On the basis of this majority united by anti-communist sentiment, successive governments have been established. Under the rule of these governments, the nation has suffered many humiliations, such as failing to oppose serious infringements on our country's independence, continuing destructive wars, and refusing to meet the reasonable demands of the working class and the working people in urban and rural areas.

Workers and democrats can see where the betrayal was committed. Combining these facts, they can appreciate the courage and scale of the Communist Party's struggle against personal dictatorship. As a result, the prestige of the Communist Party has greatly increased, and great achievements have been made on the road to united action between democratic forces and the working class.

All this has strengthened the anti-Republican intentions of those who caused the disaster. And it must be admitted that their goal – to enable the De Gaulle government to come to power – has been achieved. This means that the working class and the French people have begun a new stage in the struggle to defend the Republican system.

Therefore, it would be dangerous not to take the situation caused by the De Gaulle government coming to power very seriously.

Q: What is your opinion on the current development of events in France?

A: The General Prime Minister not only possesses the usual powers of a general government, but also has both executive and legislative powers.

De Gaulle, surrounded by ministers who are subservient to him, is a great threat to the Republican system, because he has legislative power and drafts the constitution himself in order to consolidate his personal dictatorship.

The Gaullists gave official status to the so-called Committee of Public Safety in Algeria. On that same day, a committee with the same name in Lyon issued a manifesto against workers and republicans with a clear fascist nature. This is how De Gaulle found the basis for the violent actions he used to come to power, and announced in advance that all such actions would also be justified in the future.

The Gaullists believe that the so-called Committees of Public Safety established during the riots should, on the one hand, replace the legitimate institutions of the Republic, and on the other hand, use them to engage in a fascist movement, which will play a role somewhat like the Falange in Franco's Spain in attacking political and trade union freedoms.

Since there is no mass movement of Gaullists in France, the General Prime Minister wants to create such a movement. The so-called Committees of Public Safety serve this purpose. These committees, imitating Mussolini's fascist organizations, plan to insert De Gaulle's agents into villages, towns and enterprises.

Therefore, all workers and all those who support the Republican system must unite, expose all attempts to establish such committees and mobilize the masses to fight against them, pointing out the true faces of the true organizers of these committees – spies, lackeys, agitators and fascists. The working class and the masses must get rid of these harmful elements.

In addition, as can be seen from De Gaulle's speech in Algeria, he relies on extreme colonialists and militarists. This is a serious obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Algerian problem, the result of which is the continuation of the Algerian War.

It can be seen that the new government has exposed its true colors, exposing that it represents the darkest reactionary forces and the extreme colonialist forces of big capital; these forces demand the continuation of the war in Algeria. This is contrary to the true interests of France and contains the serious danger of spreading the war to the entire North Africa. The so-called tens of millions of "French people united as one" that De Gaulle repeatedly mentioned in Algeria cannot eliminate the Algerian people's will to fight for independence.

In fact, the so-called enlightened decisions that the people around the General Prime Minister talked about some time ago are nothing more than strengthening the colonial plan that Soustelle, an agent bought by the colonialists in Algeria, had already planned.

In addition, continuing the war in Algeria cannot but seriously affect the situation of workers and the working masses. In other words, the new government will first encounter increasingly acute social problems.

General de Gaulle will try to use force to suppress any resistance to his war and poverty policies, and he will do so with the support of military personnel vying for political leadership. At the same time, according to the Gaullists, they want to eliminate all representatives of the "system" (Editor's note: refers to the Republican system) in order to establish a military dictatorship over the people in France. Preparations must be made for this situation.

It is simply a cruel mockery of history that France has lost its freedom due to its stubborn desire to impose colonialism on people who are determined to exercise their right to independence.

From these facts, it can be seen how appropriate a saying of Marx and Engels is to the current political situation in France: "A people who oppress other peoples cannot be free."

The French people are once again pitted against those officers who specialize in colonial wars, just as they were against General Saint-Arnaud during the coup of December 2, 1851.

Q: What do you think will be the development of the mass struggle?

A: The French workers and the French people will wage an arduous struggle, not only to achieve peace in Algeria, but also to defend their freedom and conditions of existence.

However, the social and political forces in France are capable of blocking the road to fascism and defeating personal dictatorship.

It must be pointed out that the development of events is not entirely as the rioters planned. They originally wanted to play unexpected tricks and establish a dictatorship when the workers and democrats were caught off guard. The French Communist Party, fully understanding the important responsibility it bears, promptly warned the working class and the people of the whole country, thereby creating the conditions for mobilizing the people to rise up and defend the Republic.

Thanks to these efforts of the French Communist Party, the resistance movement that swept across the country expanded to the National Assembly. Members of various parties, including many socialists and radical socialists, opposed the rebels with the communists and refused to support De Gaulle. However, the Political Bureau of our party emphasized that the most important thing is: "In the country, men and women with various views, communists, socialists, radical socialists, Catholics, workers, farmers, students, and outstanding intellectuals have united to defend civil rights."

Although the large-scale demonstrations, strikes, and various forms of activities in Paris and the provinces – the number of these activities has greatly increased recently – have not been able to prevent the establishment of personal dictatorship, these activities have greatly promoted the unity of all forces supporting the Republic, and created favorable conditions for a new upsurge in the struggle of the working class and democratic forces.

The Communist Party plays a leading role in uniting the people's forces against fascism, and it is the invincible vanguard of the Republican masses. As the prestige of the French Communist Party has grown in this struggle, after the first stage of the struggle, it has become stronger and more united. It is determined to strengthen the struggle and strive to unite the Republican masses, first of all to maintain the unity of all forces defending the Republic.

It is doing everything in its power to expand and strengthen the movement to unite anti-fascist forces. Thousands of Committees of Action to Defend the Republic are being established in French enterprises and urban and rural areas. These committees are produced through democratic elections, they show the fighting spirit of the masses, and prove that they oppose all conspiracies aimed at creating divisions.

The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party called on "all French people who cherish national interests and are truly loyal to the cause of the people" to confidently "launch a struggle to achieve peace in Algeria, to ensure that the demands of the working masses are met, and to ease international tensions," thereby pointing out the road that must be taken in order to prevent the fascists from establishing a shameful rule in France.

This road is the road of unity and struggle; its end is the inevitable victory after overcoming obstacles and difficulties!

    杜克洛就法国政局答“新德意志报”记者问
    法国保卫民主斗争进入新阶段
    戴高乐政府已暴露了它的极端殖民主义的真面目
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社柏林9日讯：“新德意志报”刊载了法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛向这家报纸发表的谈话。
    杜克洛说：由于一些事件的结果，戴高乐将军在6月1日从国民议会获得了总理的权力，我想在这里简单地谈一谈这些事件。
    5月13日，受共和国总统的委托组织新政府的弗林姆兰要求国民议会授予他总理全权。在同一天，阿尔及利亚的一些有极端情绪的殖民主义者在军队的支持下发动了暴乱，他们霸占了（法国政府机构）阿尔及利亚事务部，并且声称反对弗林姆兰组阁，同时要求按照他们的意见在法国组织一个政府。他们还断然说，他们要求组织以戴高乐将军为首的政府。
    当在阿尔及利亚开始发生暴乱的时候，有反叛情绪的军政人员在某些部队的支持下，开始在巴黎策划叛乱，他们之所以能够指望得到这些部队的支持，特别是因为在声名狼籍的戴高乐分子、前国防部长沙邦—戴尔马的领导下在军队中建立了“支部”。
    鉴于这种局势，共和国政府应当依靠工人阶级和人民群众，表示决心。
    但是，5月13日建立的弗林姆兰政府却选择了另外一条道路。
    法国共产党之所以让这个政府建立，是想结束政府危机，因为叛乱分子正在利用政府危机进行投机，他们企图把阿尔及利亚的暴乱扩展到巴黎。弗林姆兰政府本来拥有掌握政局的必要手段，但它却表现出软弱性，一再投降，并且竟然拒绝了最初在国民议会上向那些对阿尔及利亚事件负责的分子提出的指责，政府甚至不敢谴责进行暴乱的军人。
    在这些事件的过程中，戴高乐将军5月15日向记者说，他准备承担起共和国的全权。这不是什么别的，完全是对阿尔及利亚暴乱分子的要求的呼应。
    戴高乐的这个谈话使共和人士感到不安，他们从中看到了“军人政变”。
    随后杜克洛对记者提出的问题作了回答。
    问：“军人政变”的特征是军队反对现政权，阿尔及利亚的暴乱对法国产生了什么后果，群众对这件事的反应如何？
    答：从阿尔及利亚发出的“让军队执政”的呼叫在法国本土某些军政暴乱分子（其中包括夏申将军）的活动中得到了反映，他们也提出了类似的要求。
    由于不敢冒军事暴乱的风险，戴高乐便宁愿依靠军事暴乱的威胁在合法的幌子下掌握政权。这就是说，他不是像1851年12月2日拿破仑第三的国家政变那样用暴力驱逐议员，而是对议员施加强大压力，并且利用他们的反共偏见来迫使大多数议员认可戴高乐执政。
    但是，这些活动如果没有一定的援助，例如摩勒的援助，是不能成功的。摩勒给戴高乐将军提供了一个他所希望的机会，使他在5月19日举行了记者招待会。在这次招待会上，为了削弱共和人士的抵抗，唱了一些“安慰人心”的调子。
    当戴高乐将军的喽罗开始瓦解共和议员的士气的时候，法国共产党则竭尽全力来阻止士气的瓦解，首先是联合工人阶级和共和人士的一切力量共同行动。
    在戴高乐将军举行记者招待会的那天，成千上万的巴黎人开始罢工，以表明他们捍卫共和国的意志。
    正当分裂主义者加紧施加压力，而工人阶级和怀有共和情绪的力量展开斗争的时候，政府退却了。5月26日夜里，弗林姆兰在同戴高乐将军的秘密谈判中声明准备把总理的位置让给戴高乐。
    这个投降是在人民群众捍卫共和国的意志发展成声势浩大的示威游行的时候发生的。下面的事实表明了这一点，5月27日巴黎和外省展开了如火如荼的罢工运动，5月28日五十万巴黎人举行了声势浩大的示威游行，他们从民族广场走到共和国广场，参加示威游行的有共产党人、社会党人、激进社会党人、天主教徒和其他民主人士；广大人民群众的运动一天比一天强大，而个人独裁的拥护者却日益陷于困难的境地。
    在强大的示威游行的前夜，戴高乐将军曾经说，他“走的是建立共和政府的合法道路”。5月27日夜里弗林姆兰不顾大多数人的支持而提出了辞呈。
    问：那些在工人阶级和工人群众中制造分裂的人们的后果严重的活动在这次事态的转变中有没有决定性的作用？
    答：自从弗林姆兰政府投降以后，对于科龙贝双教堂（编者按：戴高乐居住的地方）分子来说，道路就大大敞开了，但是国内和议会内都必然还会有反抗。特别是必须争取分化社会党议会党团，因为他们绝大多数是反对戴高乐的。为了这个目的，必须把戴高乐将军装扮成“尊重民主自由的共和制拥护者”。这就是摩勒和共和国前总统阿里奥尔干的事，他们在一定程度上为候补的独裁者扫清道路。
    戴高乐将军就是用这种方式以三百二十九票对二百二十四票被给予内阁总理权力，而社会党人中有四十二个议员投了赞成票，四十九个投反对票。
    那些力图分裂工人阶级和民主力量的人的活动，就是用这种方法在特别容易攻破的地方、也就是在议会中打开了一个缺口，而戴高乐通过这个缺口就可以在遵守法律的幌子下掌握政权。同时，卑鄙的压力也促成了这件事，共和国总统第一个开了这种先例。
    分裂分子和他们的走狗们展开了真正的神经战，以便为投降准备条件，而共和国自由的坚定保卫者共产党是反对这种投降的。
    从这一切可以看出，戴高乐政府的组成只是在合法的外貌下进行的。实际上它是阿尔及利亚和阿耶佐暴乱的产物，同时也是弗林姆兰政府的可耻投降和愿意充当个人独裁工具的社会党总书记摩勒叛卖行为的结果。
    问：从这一事件里可以吸取哪些初步教训？
    答：首先，工人和民主人士可以肯定，反共情绪不仅在这一事件的过程中被暴乱分子所利用，而且早在这以前就被他们利用了。
    毫无疑问，目前局势的根源应当从十一年来经常为摩勒和比内所控制的大多数所执行的政策中去寻找，这两个人现在都参加了新政府。
    在这个由反共情绪所联合起来的多数的基础上，建立了历届的政府，在这些政府的统治下民族遭到了许多屈辱，例如对我国独立的遭到严重侵犯不加反对，继续进行破坏性的战争和拒绝满足工人阶级和城乡劳动群众的合理要求。
    工人和民主人士可以看到叛卖的勾当是在哪里干的。结合这些事实他们就可以估价共产党反对个人独裁的斗争的勇敢和规模，因此共产党的威信大大地提高了，同时在民主力量和工人阶级一致行动的道路上取得了巨大成就。
    所有这一切都加强了引起灾祸的人的反共和制度的意向。而且应当承认，他们的目的——使戴高乐政府取得政权——已经达到了。这就是说，工人阶级和法国人民开始了保卫共和制的斗争的新阶段。
    因此，如果不十分严肃地对待由于戴高乐政府的上台所造成的局势，那是危险的。
    问：您对法国目前事态的进程有什么看法？
    答：这位将军总理不仅拥有一般政府的通常权力，而且是兼有执行权和立法权的。
    周围围绕着屈从于他的部长们的戴高乐，是共和制度的莫大威胁，因为他拥有立法权，并且自己拟订宪法草案，以便以此来巩固个人的独裁。
    戴高乐分子给了阿尔及利亚的所谓救国委员会以正式的地位。就在那一天，里昂的一个名称相同的委员会发表了一个反对工人和共和主义者的带有鲜明法西斯性质的宣言。戴高乐就是这样为他借以上台的暴力行动找到了依据，并且事先宣布所有这类行动在今后也是正当的。
    戴高乐分子认为，在暴乱期间建立的所谓救国委员会一方面应当代替共和国合法的机构，另一个方面应当利用它们来搞一个法西斯运动，这个运动在攻击政治自由和工会自由这一点上，将起到多少像长枪党在佛朗哥西班牙所起的作用。
    由于在法国没有戴高乐分子的群众运动，所以这位将军总理就想搞一个这样的运动。所谓救国委员会就是为此目的服务的，这些委员会效法墨索里尼的法西斯组织，打算把戴高乐的代理人安插到各村镇和企业中去。
    因此，所有的工人和一切拥护共和政体的人就必须联合起来，揭露想建立这种委员会的一切企图并动员人民群众同它斗争，指出这些委员会的真正组织者——特务、走狗、煽动分子和法西斯分子的真正面目。工人阶级和人民群众必须除掉这些害群之马。
    除此之外，从戴高乐在阿尔及利亚的演说中可以看出，他所依靠的是极端的殖民主义分子和军国主义分子。这是对和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的严重障碍，其结果就是继续进行阿尔及利亚战争。
    由此可见，新政府暴露了自己的真面目，暴露了它是代表最黑暗的反动势力和大资本的极端殖民主义势力的；这种势力要求继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争。这是违背法国的真正利益的，并且蕴藏着把战争蔓延到整个北非的严重危险。戴高乐在阿尔及利亚一再说到的所谓几千万“法国人合为一体”的那句话，消灭不了阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的意志。
    事实上，将军总理周围的人士前些时候所谈到的所谓开明的决定，归结起来不过是加强在阿尔及利亚的殖民主义分子所收买的代理人苏斯戴尔早就策划的殖民主义计划而已。
    此外，继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争不能不严重影响工人和劳动群众的境况，换句话说，新政府首先就要碰到日益尖锐的社会问题。
    戴高乐将军会试图用武力来镇压对他的战争和贫困政策的任何反抗，他将在争夺政治领导地位的军人的支持下这样做。同时，据戴高乐分子说，他们要排挤“制度”（编者按：指共和制度）的一切代表，以便在法国建立对人民的军事独裁。对这种情况必须有所准备。
    法国由于顽固地想把殖民主义强加在坚决要求行使自己独立权利的人民身上而丧失了自由，这简直是历史的无情嘲笑。
    根据这些事实可以看出，对法国目前政治局势来说，马克思和恩格斯的一句话是多么贴切：“压迫别国人民的人民，不可能是自由的。”
    法国人民同那些专门从事殖民战争的军官们再次对立起来了，正如1851年12月2日政变时同圣·阿诺将军对立一样。
    问：您认为，群众斗争将会有怎样的发展？
    答：法国工人和法国人民将要进行艰苦的斗争，他们不仅要争取在阿尔及利亚建立和平，而且要保卫自己的自由和生存的条件。
    但是，法国的社会力量和政治力量是能够堵塞法西斯的道路和击败个人独裁的。
    必须指出，事件的发展并不完全像暴乱者所策划的那样。他们原先想玩弄出人意料的花样，在工人和民主人士措手不及的情况下建立起独裁统治。法国共产党由于充分理解到自己肩负着的重大责任，及时地向工人阶级和全国人民发出警告，从而创造了动员人民起来保卫共和国的条件。
    由于法国共产党的这些努力，席卷全国各地的抵抗运动扩大到国民议会。各党的议员，其中有许多社会党人和激进社会党人，同共产党人一起反对叛乱分子，并且拒绝支持戴高乐。然而，我们党的政治局着重指出，最主要的是：“在国内，抱着各种观点的男女，共产党人、社会党人、激进社会党人、天主教徒、工人、农民、学生以及杰出的知识分子已经联合起来保卫公民权利。”
    虽然，巴黎和外省的声势浩大的示威游行、罢工和各种形式的活动——近来这些活动的次数大大增加了——没有能阻止个人独裁的建立，但是这些活动大大促成了一切拥护共和的力量的团结一致、并且为工人阶级和民主力量斗争的新高潮创造了有利的条件。
    共产党人在联合人民力量反对法西斯方面起着头等重要的作用，它是共和群众的不可战胜的先锋队。由于法国共产党的威信在这个斗争中增长了，在斗争的第一阶段之后，它更加强大、更加团结了。它满怀决心要加强斗争，争取团结共和群众，首先是要维护一切保卫共和国的力量的团结一致。
    它正在尽一切力量，扩大和加强团结反法西斯力量的运动，在法国各企业和城乡各地正在成立成千上万的保卫共和国行动委员会，这些委员会是通过民主的选举方式产生的，它们显示了群众的斗志，并且证明它们反对一切旨在造成分裂的阴谋。
    法国共产党政治局号召“一切珍视国家利益和真正忠于人民事业的法国人”信心百倍地“展开斗争，争取阿尔及利亚和平，争取使劳动群众的要求得到满足，争取缓和国际紧张局势”，从而指出了为了阻止法西斯分子在法国建立可耻的统治所必须走的道路。
    这条道路就是团结和斗争的道路；它的结局就是在克服障碍和困难之后必然获得胜利！
