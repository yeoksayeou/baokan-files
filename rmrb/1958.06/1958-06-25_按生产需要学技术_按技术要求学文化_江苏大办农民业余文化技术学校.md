Learn Technology According to Production Needs, Learn Culture According to Technical Requirements:
Jiangsu Vigorously Runs Peasants' Spare-Time Cultural and Technical Schools

(Our Reporter Zhu Bingju reports) Jiangsu Province's large-scale mass literacy campaign has entered a new stage. Various localities are vigorously running peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools. In areas where illiteracy among rural middle-aged and young people has been basically eliminated, they are continuing to advance towards eliminating cultural illiteracy and scientific illiteracy, further improving cultural and scientific levels on the basis of literacy.

Jiangsu Province's creation of peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools is in response to the current requirements of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants to learn scientific and technical knowledge and consolidate literacy achievements. The participants in the cultural and technical schools are mostly young and middle-aged farmers who have graduated from literacy classes, as well as some older farmers and women. These schools generally operate on an evening class system, conducting teaching under conditions that do not hinder production. Further improving the masses' cultural and scientific knowledge on the basis of consolidating literacy results is deeply welcomed by the masses. These schools combine the advantages of the original peasants' spare-time higher primary schools and the new technical training classes run by cooperatives and have developed them further. Peasants' spare-time higher primary schools conducted teaching according to the requirements of regular higher primary schools and could not be closely integrated with current production, making it impossible to run many of them. The new technical training classes run by cooperatives mainly focused on arranging production work and imparting production technology, taking on a conference nature and lacking long-term planning. Now, various localities are combining these two forms, drawing on strengths and overcoming weaknesses, so that technical learning and cultural learning have a fixed form, combining the learning of technology with the implementation of production technical specifications, making them schools that are loved by the masses. The learning content of peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools is to learn technology according to production needs and to learn culture according to technical requirements. Because learning is closely integrated with production and work, learning is not squeezed out due to busy farm work. School teachers are generally composed of township and commune cadres, veteran farmers, agricultural technicians, and primary school teachers. The learning methods adopted are a combination of classroom teaching, group discussions, and practical labor.

Since the spring of this year, Jiangsu Province's literacy campaign has appeared with a surging posture from the beginning. Encouraged by the great leap forward situation, more than 9.4 million young and middle-aged illiterates in the province have ignited an increasingly high enthusiasm for learning culture. People have taken out soaring energy, overcome various difficulties, and achieved great results. Now, Liyang, Hanjiang, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Kunshan, Huaiyin, and other six counties have basically eliminated illiteracy. The province has also seen more than 300 basically illiterate townships and more than 4,000 basically illiterate communes. Two million farmers have graduated from literacy classes, and the remaining more than 7 million illiterates have also mostly reached the semi-illiterate level. After these young and middle-aged people in these areas escaped illiteracy, they successively demanded to learn technology and culture. Various localities, according to the needs of the masses, have run a large number of peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools. Liyang County has already run 3,229 peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools, with the participation of 52,000 farmers, accounting for about 68% of the literacy graduates. Sanguan Township in Jiangyin County has run 21 spare-time cultural and technical schools and 218 classes, with more than 4,400 farmers participating in learning, achieving the goal of having a school in every commune and a class in every team. Hanjiang, Jingjiang, Yancheng, and other places have already run many similar schools; Zhenjiang Prefecture is also carrying out preparatory work.

Some of these areas that have already run peasants' spare-time cultural and technical schools have also initially stipulated that within three years, after each student graduates from the spare-time cultural and technical school, their cultural and scientific knowledge should be improved to the level of a junior technician. Now, most townships and communes have compiled and printed textbooks based on the central tasks of current production, with production technology as the content. Class time, according to the current busy farming situation, is generally twice a week. The students have learned cultural and production technology knowledge in the classroom, and they have also understood the requirements of the Party Committee for the current production work, which has played a significant role in improving production technology and promoting production. Many women in many areas have learned how to transplant seedlings and understand the technical specifications of deep plowing and close planting after entering the spare-time cultural and technical schools. All the rice paddies in Yiqiang Commune in Jingjiang County were made in accordance with the requirements in the textbook, and the general rice paddies can achieve "the field is as flat as a mirror, the mud is as fine as pulp, the field has no weeds, and the sowing is uniform." In the past, some commune members saw that the "1605" pesticide was very toxic and did not dare to use it. After the explanation, they understood its performance and learned the technology of its use, eliminated their concerns, and actively strengthened the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. In order to strengthen leadership over schools, many regions have established a spare-time cultural and technical education committee in the county with agriculture, culture and education, popular science and other units; the township has established a branch with the technical extension station as a specific guiding institution; and the commune has established a group.

Areas in Jiangsu Province that have not yet eliminated illiteracy are shifting from a concentrated study and crash literacy model to decentralized learning, combining it with the characteristics of the current busy farming season. Many farmers in many areas have also developed self-study and review plans during busy farming.

    江苏大办农民业余文化技术学校
    本报讯　记者朱冰菊报道：江苏省大规模的群众扫盲运动进入新阶段，各地大办农民业余文化技术学校，在基本上扫除了农村中青壮年文盲的地区，继续向扫文化盲、扫科学盲进军，将文化、科学水平在扫盲基础上再提高一步。
    江苏省创办农民业余文化技术学校是适应当前农业生产大跃进的要求，适应广大农民迫切要求学习科学技术知识和巩固扫盲成绩的新型学校，参加文化技术学校学习的，大部分是扫盲毕业的青壮年农民，也有老农和妇女。这种学校，一般采取晚班制，在不妨碍生产的条件下进行教学。在巩固扫盲成果的基础上，进一步提高群众的文化科学知识水平，深受群众欢迎。这种学校把原有的农民业余高小和合作社新办的技术训练班的优点结合起来并且有了发展。农民业余高小按照正规高小的要求进行教学，和当前的生产不能紧密结合，不可能办得很多，合作社新办的技术训练班，以布置生产工作和传授生产技术为主，带有会议性质，缺乏长远打算。现在，各地将这两种形式结合起来，取长补短，使技术学习和文化学习有了固定的形式，把学习技术和贯彻生产技术规格结合起来，成为群众所喜爱的学校。农民业余文化技术学校的学习内容是根据生产需要学习技术，根据技术要求学习文化。由于学习和生产、工作紧密结合，因此，不会因为农活忙而挤掉学习。学校教师一般由乡、社干部、老农、农业技术员和小学教师担任。学习方法采取课堂教学、小组讨论和劳动实践相结合。
    今春以来，江苏省的扫盲运动一开始就以波涛汹涌的姿态出现。全省九百四十多万青壮年文盲在大跃进形势鼓舞下，燃起了愈来愈高涨的学习文化的热情。人们拿出了冲天的干劲，战胜了各种困难，取得了很大的成绩。现在溧阳、邗江、江阴、靖江、昆山、淮阴等六县基本上扫除了文盲。全省还出现了三百多个基本无盲乡镇和四千多个基本无盲社。有二百万农民扫盲毕了业，其余七百多万文盲也大部分达到了半文盲水平。这些地区的青壮年摆脱文盲状态后，纷纷要求学习技术和文化。各地根据群众的需要办起了大批的农民业余文化技术学校。溧阳县已经办起了三千二百二十九所农民业余文化技术学校，参加学习的农民达五万二千多人，约占扫盲毕业学员的68％。江阴县三官乡办起了业余文化技术学校二十一所和二百十八个班，有四千四百多个农民参加了学习，做到了社社建校，队队设班。邗江、靖江、盐城等地已办了不少类似这样的学校；镇江专区也在进行准备工作。
    这些已办起农民业余文化技术学校的地区，有些还初步规定了在三年内每个学员在业余文化技术学校毕业后，在文化和科学知识方面都提高到初级技术员水平。现在，大部分乡社都根据当前生产的中心任务，以生产技术为内容编印了课本。上课时间，根据目前农忙情况，一般每周上课两次。学员们在课堂上学习了文化和生产技术知识，又了解了党委对当前生产工作的要求，对提高生产技术和推动生产起了显著作用。很多地区的妇女进了业余文化技术学校后，都学会了栽秧和懂得了深耕密植的技术规格。靖江县义强社全社所有的秧田，都是按照课本上的要求做的，一般秧田都能做到“田平如镜，泥细如浆，田无杂草，播种均匀”。过去有些社员见“1605”农药毒性大，都不敢使用，经过讲解后，懂得了它的性能，并学会了使用技术，消除了顾虑，积极加强防治病虫害。很多地区为了对学校加强领导，在县里以农业、文教、科普等单位成立了业余文化技术教育委员会；乡里以技术推广站为具体指导机构，设立了分会；社里成立了小组。
    江苏省尚未扫除文盲的地区，正结合当前农忙季节的特点，由突击识字和集中学习转为分散学习。很多地区的农民在农忙中还制订了自学和复习计划。
