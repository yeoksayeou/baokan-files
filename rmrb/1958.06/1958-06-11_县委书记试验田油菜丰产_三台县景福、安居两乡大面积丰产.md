    County Party Secretary's Experimental Plot Achieves High Yield of Rapeseed
    Large-Scale High Yield in Jingfu and Anju Townships, Santai County
    (Our Correspondent Sun Yuedong reports) Two county Party secretaries in Sichuan Province have achieved high yields of rapeseed in their experimental plots. One is Li Feng, the Party Secretary of the CPC Nanbu County Committee, whose two mu experimental plot in the Jinxing Second Agricultural Cooperative yielded an average of 525 jin per mu. The other is Su Chengye, the Party Secretary of the CPC Yingshan County Committee, whose 2.1 mu experimental plot in the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative yielded an average of 508 jin of rapeseed per mu.

    The main experiences of these two secretaries in achieving high rapeseed yields in their experimental plots have recently been summarized: First, they adopted the improved variety "Victory Rapeseed" and ensured appropriately early sowing. Li Feng's rapeseed had a growing period extended to over 210 days, allowing the rapeseed to fully develop and grow. In terms of cultivation methods, they both adopted row sowing with close planting. In terms of fertilization methods, they both implemented heavy application of base fertilizer and multiple top dressings in stages, especially focusing on top dressing during the bolting and flowering stages in the later growth period.

    Throughout the entire production process from rapeseed sowing to harvest, these two secretaries personally participated in manual labor. In addition to actively adopting various advanced production technologies, they also humbly listened to the opinions of local elderly farmers and absorbed their good production experiences. During the production period, Li Feng often worked with experienced elderly farmers and technical cadres from the agricultural department in the agricultural cooperative to jointly study production technologies and improve the experimental plots. As a result, advanced production technologies, tailored to local conditions and combined with the farmers' experience, were easily accepted by the local farmers, and many advanced technologies were quickly promoted in the nearby rural areas.

    (Our Correspondent reports) New records for large-scale rapeseed high yields have emerged in Jingfu and Anju townships, Santai County, Sichuan Province. The 58 mu of rapeseed in the Jingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Jingfu Township yielded 336 jin per mu. The average yield per mu for the entire township, totaling over 340 mu of rapeseed, reached 209 jin, an increase of 60% compared to last year. The 21 mu of rapeseed in the Hongxing Cooperative in Anju Township yielded an average of 346 jin per mu. Many high-yield records have also emerged in these two townships. The 1.6 mu of rapeseed in the Tanxin Cooperative yielded an average of 617 jin per mu, which is the highest among the reported high-yield records in the entire province. The two mu of rapeseed in the Hongxing Cooperative yielded 613 jin per mu. (Pan Jingcheng) (Attached photo)

### 县委书记试验田油菜丰产  三台县景福、安居两乡大面积丰产

    县委书记试验田油菜丰产
    三台县景福、安居两乡大面积丰产
    本报讯　记者孙跃冬报道：四川省两位中共县委书记试验田里种的油菜，获得高额丰产。这两位县委书记，一位是中共南部县委书记李峰，他在金星第二农业社种植的两亩试验田的油菜，平均每亩产五百二十五斤；另一位是中共营山县委书记苏承业，他在新生农业社的二亩一分试验田里种植的油菜，平均每亩产油菜籽五百零八斤。
    这两位书记在试验田里获得油菜高额产量的主要经验，最近已分别总结出来：首先，他们采用了良种胜利油菜，并作到适当提早播种。李峰种植的油菜，生长期延长到二百一十多天，使油菜得到充分发育生长。他们在栽培方法上，都采用条播密植。在施肥方法上，都是实行重施底肥和分期多次追肥，特别是抓紧生长后期的抽苔、现花时期的追肥。
    从油菜播种到收获的整个生产过程，这两位书记都是亲自参加生产劳动。他们除了积极采用各种先进生产技术以外，还虚心听取当地老年农民的意见，吸取他们好的生产经验。李峰在生产期间，经常和农业社里有经验的老年农民、农业部门的技术干部在一起共同研究生产技术，共同来把试验田搞好。这样，由于先进生产技术因地制宜地和农民的经验结合起来，就容易为当地农民所接受，因而许多先进技术都很快地在附近农村中推广开来。
    本报讯　四川省三台县景福、安居两个乡出现油菜大面积丰产新纪录。景福乡景福农业社五十八亩油菜，每亩产三百三十六斤，全乡共三百四十多亩油菜，平均亩产达到二百零九斤，比去年增产60％。安居乡红星社二十一亩油菜，平均亩产三百四十六斤。在这两个乡还出现了不少高额丰产纪录。谈心社一点六亩油菜，平均亩产六百一十七斤，这在目前全省已传出的丰产纪录中是最高的。红星社的两亩油菜，亩产六百一十三斤。（潘竟成）（附图片）
