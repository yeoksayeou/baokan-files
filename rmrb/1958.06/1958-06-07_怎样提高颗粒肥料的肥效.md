　　How to Improve the Fertilizer Efficiency of Granular Fertilizer
    Recently, we have received letters from readers asking how to improve the fertilizer efficiency of granular fertilizers. Now we will publish the "Opinions on Manufacturing and Promoting Granular Fertilizers" from the Ministry of Agriculture in an excerpt here for reference.
              Editor
    According to advanced Soviet experience, the use of organic fertilizers (such as manure, peat, etc.) mixed with powdered superphosphate to prepare organic-inorganic granular fertilizers can reduce the chances of phosphate fertilizer being fixed by elements such as iron, aluminum, and calcium in the soil, thereby increasing the fertilizer efficiency of superphosphate. In order to improve the fertilizer efficiency of granular fertilizers, the use of manufacturing raw materials should be strictly controlled.
    I. One should not use garbage containing furnace ash and soil as raw materials for preparing granular fertilizers. To avoid phosphate being fixed by elements such as iron and aluminum in the soil, powdered superphosphate can be mixed with manure, etc., and composted before application, or made into granular fertilizer for application, depending on local conditions. According to the analysis of granular fertilizer products made by granular fertilizer plants in twelve counties in Jiangxi Province, such as Duchang, Xingzi, and Ji'an, using garbage, pond mud, ammonium sulfate, and superphosphate, the nitrogen loss was 12.8%—88.7%, and the deterioration of phosphate fertilizer accounted for 34.5%—99.9%. The reason for the loss is that, on the one hand, the furnace ash contained in the garbage is alkaline, and the nitrogen contained in ammonium sulfate will volatilize and be lost when it encounters alkaline substances; on the other hand, during the drying process of granular fertilizers (especially high-temperature drying), inorganic nitrogen fertilizer crystallizes on the surface of the granules as water evaporates, resulting in loss due to abrasion; at the same time, substances such as lime, aluminum, and iron contained in furnace ash or soil such as pond mud and river mud fix the phosphate in superphosphate. Therefore, when preparing granular fertilizers, it is necessary to select well-rotted organic fertilizers as raw materials and mix them with superphosphate. II. Nitrogen chemical fertilizers should not be processed into granular fertilizers. Most areas use chemical nitrogen fertilizers (ammonium sulfate) and chemical phosphate fertilizers (superphosphate) in combination to prepare granular fertilizers, and many areas even use nitrogen fertilizer as the main component. The purpose of preparing granular fertilizer is to improve the application effect of powdered superphosphate, while the fertilizer content of nitrogen chemical fertilizers will not be fixed and invalidated by the soil, but the fertilizer content is easily lost when used to prepare granular fertilizers; at the same time, making nitrogen fertilizer into granular fertilizer is not as effective as the original.
    III. Slow-release phosphate fertilizers such as bone meal should not be used to prepare granular fertilizers. Some areas use bird droppings, bone meal, Thomas phosphate fertilizer, or phosphate rock powder (directly used or treated with sulfuric acid to make so-called "acid phosphate rock powder") to replace superphosphate in the preparation of granular fertilizers. Although these fertilizers are all phosphate fertilizers, they are acid-soluble, slow-release fertilizers that must rely on organic acids in the soil to dissolve before they can be absorbed and utilized by crops. If they are made into granules and applied, reducing contact with the soil, the fertilizer effect will be even slower.
    IV. In some areas, the masses individually process farm manure such as human, animal, and poultry manure into granules for use. This method does not increase the fertilizer efficiency compared to direct application of farm manure, but only increases labor costs.

### 怎样提高颗粒肥料的肥效

　　怎样提高颗粒肥料的肥效
    近来我们曾接到一些读者来信，问怎样提高颗粒肥料的肥效问题。现在我们将农业部“关于制造推广颗粒肥料的意见”，摘要发表在这里，供各地参考。
              编者
    根据苏联先进经验，利用有机质肥料（如厩肥、泥炭等）与粉状过磷酸钙混合调制有机无机颗粒肥料，可以减少过磷酸钙肥分为土壤中铁、铝、钙等元素固定的机会，从而提高过磷酸钙的肥效。为了提高颗粒肥料的肥效，应该严格掌握制造原料的使用。
    一、调制颗粒肥料不应采用含有炉灰的垃圾和泥土作原料。为避免磷酸为土壤里铁、铝等元素固定，粉状过磷酸钙可以根据本地具体情况采用与厩肥等混合堆沤后施用，或制成颗粒肥料施用。根据江西省都昌、星子、吉安等十二个县颗粒肥料厂利用垃圾、塘泥与硫酸铵、过磷酸钙制成颗粒肥料成品的化验，氮素损失12.8％—88.7％，磷肥变质的占34.5％—99.9％。造成损失的原因，一方面因为垃圾中所含炉灰是碱性，硫酸铵中所含氮素遇碱性物质后即挥发损失；另一方面，在颗粒肥料干燥过程中（特别是高温干燥），无机氮肥随水分的蒸散而结晶于颗粒表面，擦落损失；同时，炉灰或塘泥、河泥等泥土中所含石灰、铝、铁等物质，使过磷酸钙的磷酸被固定。因此，调制颗粒肥料，必须选用腐熟良好的有机质肥料作原料，与过磷酸钙混合。二、氮素化学肥料不应加工调制颗粒肥料。各地大多采用化学氮肥（硫酸铵）和化学磷肥（过磷酸钙）配合调制颗粒肥料，很多地区还以氮肥为主。调制颗粒肥料的目的在于提高粉状过磷酸钙的施用效果，而氮素化学肥料的肥分不会为土壤固定而失效，用来调制颗粒肥料时，肥分却易遭损失；同时，把氮肥制成颗粒肥料，不如原来的肥效快。
    三、骨粉等迟效性磷肥不宜调制颗粒肥料。有些地区采用鸟粪、骨粉、汤马斯磷肥或磷矿粉（直接使用或经过硫酸处理制成所谓“酸性磷矿石粉”）等来代替过磷酸钙调制颗粒肥料。这些肥料虽然都是磷肥，但它们是酸溶性的迟效肥料，施到土里，须靠土壤中的有机酸加以溶解，才能供作物吸收利用，如果制成颗粒状施用，减少与土壤接触，肥效更迟慢。
    四、有些地区群众单独用农家肥料如人、畜及家禽粪便等加工制成颗粒状使用，这样作肥效并不比直接施用农家肥料有所增加，徒然增加了工本。
