Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, June 26th. According to the cooperation agreement between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences, the Sino-Soviet Hainan Island Marine Animal Expedition, composed of the Institute of Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Zoology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, conducted investigations and studies on the marine coastal zone fauna and ecology in Hainan Island from March to mid-June this year.

    The main task of the expedition was to conduct comparative studies on the invertebrate fauna and ecology of tropical marine coastal zones, to understand the vertical distribution of various invertebrates in the intertidal zone, to calculate their biomass, and to estimate the yield or reserves of economic species. The expedition has now successfully completed its field investigation task and is currently summarizing its work in Qingdao.

    The leaders of the expedition were Professor Guryanova, a marine animal ecologist and crustacean expert from the Institute of Zoology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, representing the Soviet side, and Professor Zhang Xi, Deputy Director of the Institute of Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, representing the Chinese side. The expedition selected four representative areas in Hainan Island, including Haikou, for investigation. These areas included coastlines of different characteristics, such as coral reefs, mangrove forests, sandy beaches, rocky shores, and estuarine zones. Detailed comparative studies were conducted on the fauna and ecological characteristics of various animals living in different environments, obtaining a large amount of valuable data and collecting a large number of animal specimens, including many economic species and rare and precious specimens, such as the square-thorn sea cucumber, the acorn worm, and the lancelet. It is particularly worth mentioning that in the field of ecological research, a method for calculating coral biomass was created. Professor Guryanova said excitedly: "I am very happy that the method for calculating coral biomass was first researched by the joint efforts of Soviet and Chinese scientists, by our socialist countries." At the same time, in the research on monogenean parasites that harm fish, in addition to collecting many new species, a new family was also discovered.

    中苏海南岛海洋动物考察团
    胜利完成野外考察任务
    据新华社青岛26日电　根据中苏两国科学院的合作协定，由中国科学院海洋生物研究所和苏联科学院动物研究所组成的中苏海南岛海洋动物考察团，今年3月到6月中旬在海南岛进行了海洋沿岸地带动物区系和生态学的调查研究。
    考察团的主要任务是对热带海洋沿岸地带无脊椎动物区系和生态学进行比较研究，了解各类无脊椎动物在潮间带的垂直分布情况，计算它们的生物量，估计经济种类的产量或蕴藏量。现在考察团已胜利地完成了野外考察任务，正在青岛做工作总结。
    考察团的团长，苏联方面是苏联科学院动物研究所海洋动物生态学家、甲壳动物学专家古里扬诺娃教授，中国方面是中国科学院海洋生物研究所副所长张玺教授。考察团在海南岛选择了海口等四个有代表性的地区进行了调查工作，这些地区包括了性质不同的海岸，有珊瑚礁、红树丛林、沙滩、岩岸和河口地带。对生活在不同环境中的各类动物区系和生态特点作了细致的比较研究，获得了许多宝贵的资料，采到大量的动物标本，其中包括很多经济种类和珍奇罕见的标本，如方刺参、柱头虫、文昌鱼等。尤其值得提出的是在生态学研究方面，创造了珊瑚生物量的计算方法。古里扬诺娃教授兴奋地说：“我非常高兴的是，珊瑚生物量的计算方法，这次由苏中两国科学家合作、由我们社会主义国家先研究出来。”同时，在危害鱼类的单殖类寄生虫研究方面，除收集到很多新种外，还发现了一个新的科类。
