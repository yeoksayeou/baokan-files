    Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line

    I Came Up With Multi-Surface Grinding Method

    After the victorious closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the factory Party committee secretary conveyed to us the General Line formulated by the Party: going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. When I heard that catching up with and surpassing England would not require fifteen years or more, but rather within fifteen years or even less, I was very excited and felt a tremendous force encouraging me. I resolved to contribute all my strength to realizing the General Line.

    After the meeting, I thought about how to transform my resolve into strength and apply it to actual production. I thought about my work of manufacturing intake valves for locomotive boilers, for which the quota was eighteen minutes per piece, but I could not complete the quota every day. However, for a long time, I lacked the confidence to overcome difficulties. Thinking about the Party committee secretary's conveyance and the Congress resolution, I realized that the main reason for my long-term inability to complete the production quota was my conservative thinking and failure to break away from the old ways of working. So I resolved to complete and exceed the production quota in the shortest possible time. I pondered it for a whole day and finally came up with a multi-surface grinding method and improved the scribing method in the cutting process. After testing, the work efficiency was eight times higher than the original quota. I deeply realized that the General Line is a lighthouse illuminating our path forward.

    在总路线的光辉照耀下
    我想出了多面磨削法
    党的“八大”二次会议胜利闭幕后，厂党委书记向我们传达了党所制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，当我听到赶上和超过英国，不需要十五年或更多的时间，而是在十五年内或者更短一点时间的时候，我非常兴奋，觉得有一股巨大的力量鼓舞着我，决心要为实现总路线贡献出自己的全部力量。
    散会以后，我就想怎样把自己的决心化为力量，把它用到实际生产上去。我想起我所担任的制造锅驼机零件进气阀的工作，定额规定十八分钟做一个，但我每天都不能完成定额。但是长期以来，总是缺乏克服困难的信心。想到党委书记的传达和大会决议，认识到过去长期不能完成生产定额的主要原因，是自己有保守思想，没有打破老一套的工作方法。于是我就下决心在最短的时间内要完成和超过生产定额。我整整地琢磨了一天，终于想出来一种多面磨削法并改进切断工序上的划线方法，经过试验，工作效率比原来定额提高八倍。我深深地体会到，总路线是照耀我们前进的灯塔。
