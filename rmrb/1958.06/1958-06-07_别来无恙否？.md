　　“Have you been well since we last met?”
　　Zhao Su
　　In ancient times, when people met or corresponded, they often inquired about each other with concern, saying, "Have you been well since we last met?" "Wu yang" (无恙) means without worry or illness.

　　However, the character "yang" (恙) has an unexpected meaning, namely an insect called a "tsutsugamushi."

　　Tsutsugamushi, also known as sand fleas, belong to the insect class and like to inhabit damp and dark places. They are abundant in valleys, forests, bushes, rivers, and areas after floods. They grow and reproduce in the summer, and the eggs, pupae, and adults can all live independently. Only the larvae live a parasitic life. Adults are about six millimeters long, small ones are spherical, and large ones are oval, orange-yellow in color, with four pairs of hairy legs and a pair of fiery red compound eyes (composed of ten ocelli). They live by sucking the juice of plants. The larvae are only four millimeters long, shaped like a sac, like scabies mites, and come in red and white colors. They have only three pairs of legs and live by sucking animal fluids. The larvae often parasitize the ear shells, anus, and tails of various rodents and birds. They bite people, and when they bite, people do not feel any pain, but they can cause tsutsugamushi disease (also known as sand flea fever, river fever, flood fever).

　　Tsutsugamushi disease is a febrile infectious disease. This disease was described in Chinese medical books of the Jin and Ming dynasties. It was not until the 19th century that foreign medical scientists further studied it. The disease is prevalent from June to September. It has occurred in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Burma, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Ceylon, and other places. During World War II, it was once prevalent among the British and American troops stationed in India and Burma. It has also appeared in Taiwan, Guangdong, Hubei, as well as Kunming and Lanzhou in China. In 1951, it also had a small epidemic in Fujian. The disease has an incubation period of four to twenty days, during which there are no significant symptoms. Once the onset of the disease occurs, the symptoms come suddenly and aggressively. It is often: chills and fever above 40 degrees Celsius, severe headache, sometimes pain in the abdomen and body, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the whole body's lymph nodes and spleen, and papules on the skin where it was bitten (mostly in the armpits, groin, anus, and genitals), with eschars on top, and ulcers under the eschars. This period lasts about three weeks before entering the recovery period. In the past, the mortality rate of this disease was very high, reaching up to 50%. Now, with the use of chloramphenicol and aureomycin for treatment, there are very few deaths. However, effective drugs for preventing this disease have not yet been developed.

　　However, tsutsugamushi is only a vector for transmitting this disease, not the pathogen itself. The pathogen is a bacterium called "Orientia tsutsugamushi," which is smaller than ordinary bacteria but larger than filterable viruses, and easily multiplies and grows on tsutsugamushi. Because tsutsugamushi is the only insect vector for transmitting tsutsugamushi disease, it should be eradicated regardless of whether it carries this bacterium or not.

### “别来无恙否？”

　　“别来无恙否？”
　　赵素
    古人在相见或通信的时候，常常关切地问候对方道：“别来无恙否？”无恙，是没忧没病的意思。
    但是，恙字还有一个意想不到的解释，即一种虫，叫恙虫。
    恙虫又叫沙虱，属昆虫类，喜欢栖息在潮湿阴暗的地方，在山谷、丛林、草莽、河流、洪水过后的地区很多。它在夏天生长繁殖，卵、蛹、成虫都能独立生活，只有幼虫过着寄生生活。成虫长六厘左右，小的成球形状态，大的成椭圆形，颜色橙黄，全身有四对毛拉拉的脚和一对火红的复眼（是十只单眼组成的），靠吸取植物的汁为生。幼虫只长四厘，成囊形，像疥虫，颜色红白都有，脚只有三对，靠吸吮动物的液体为生。幼虫常常寄生在各种鼠类雀类的耳壳、肛门周围、尾巴上，会咬人，咬的时候使人觉不出一点痛来，但是可能引起恙虫病（又叫沙虱热、河流热、洪水热）。
    恙虫病是一种热性传染病，在我国晋代、明代的医书中也描述过这病，以后直到十九世纪，才有外国医学家来进一步研究。这病在6月到9月间流行；在日本、朝鲜、越南、缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚、马来亚、菲律宾、锡兰等地方，都曾发生过；第二次世界大战时期，曾一度流行在驻印、缅地区的英美驻军中；我国的台湾、两广、湖北以及昆明、兰州，也曾出现过，1951年还在福建小流行过。这病有四天至二十天的潜伏期，期内没有什么显著症状。一到发病期，病状突然而来，来势又急又凶，常常是：发冷发烧到摄氏四十度以上，剧烈头痛，肚子和周身有时也疼，恶心呕吐，全身淋巴腺和脾脏肿大，皮肤被咬处（大都在腋窝、腹股沟、肛门、阴部）产生丘疹，上面有焦痂，痂下在溃烂。这段时期大约要三个星期，才进入恢复期。从前这病的死亡率很高，最高达到50％。现在采用氯霉素，金霉素治疗，死亡的很少了。而预防这病的有效药剂，至今没有研究出来。
    不过，恙虫只是传染这病的媒介，不是病原体。病原体是一种叫做“东方立克次氏体”的病菌，比一般细菌小而比滤过性病毒大，容易在恙虫身上繁殖生长。因为恙虫是传染恙虫病的唯一媒介昆虫，所以不管它是否带有这种病菌，都应该扑灭。
