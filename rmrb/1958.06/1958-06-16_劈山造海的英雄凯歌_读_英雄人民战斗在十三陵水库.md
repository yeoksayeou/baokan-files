    Heroic Ode to Splitting Mountains and Creating Seas
    ——Reading "Heroic People Fighting at the Ming Tombs Reservoir"
    Guo Ye

    In the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the heroic builders created amazing miracles and wrote magnificent poems. On the construction site, everywhere were inspiring heroic deeds, everywhere were poetic creations of heroic spirit. The newly published "Heroic People Fighting at the Ming Tombs Reservoir" (Political Department of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Headquarters, Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, editors) published by Beijing Publishing House, is part of the thousands of poems that emerged on the construction site. This collection of poems collects more than one hundred folk songs and poems, which generally express the soaring revolutionary spirit and the great power of splitting mountains and creating seas of the reservoir builders. It is particularly worth mentioning that most of the poems in this collection are created by the reservoir builders themselves, and most are folk songs and folk rhymes.

    Listen to the heroic words of the reservoir builders: "Heroic sons and daughters have heroic courage, revolutionary ambition is as high as the sky, bold words shock the world, vowing to run ahead of the flood." The heroes want to "build a dam to block the river," and also want to "push down the Shadow Wall Mountain." The heroes want to let the "barren mountains of Yanbei wear green clothes," and also want to let "Yanbei become Jiangnan." Such heroic songs can be heard everywhere on the construction site. In the face of difficulties, in the face of wind, sand and severe cold, the reservoir builders also showed unparalleled heroism: "The fierce tiger with hanging eyes is afraid of Wu Song, and since ancient times, difficulties are afraid of heroes. We are all heroes, scaring away the shadow of difficulties." When the copper wall-like dam is about to be completed, when the heroes have made immortal contributions to the reservoir, the heroes sing heartfelt praises in unison: "A grain of sand on the flood dam, a small drop of water in the middle of the sea, what is personal merit, the Party's merit is greater than the sky!" This is not only a heartfelt praise from the reservoir builders, but also a heartfelt praise from the people of the whole country.

    In the days when the reservoir construction was reaching one climax after another, our great leader Chairman Mao and other leading comrades of the Party Central Committee came to the construction site to participate in voluntary labor, which added unparalleled glory to the Ming Tombs Reservoir and brought great encouragement to the reservoir builders. At the boiling construction site, the reservoir builders, writers and poets excitedly wrote passionate odes: "Everyone is excited and overjoyed, everyone's enthusiasm is spurting like a spring, the enthusiasm for labor reaches a climax, Chairman Mao comes to the Ming Tombs." After Chairman Mao and other leading comrades left the construction site, an even higher wave of labor enthusiasm was set off on the construction site. As the poet sings: "His laughter is still there, his warmth is left on the shovel; look at the dam tonight, it will rise three feet three!"

    The world-shaking Ming Tombs Reservoir is about to be completed successfully. Let us thank the wise leadership of the Party and the kind care of the leader. Let us thank the heroic reservoir builders who have created a happy paradise for us and written a heroic ode to splitting mountains and creating seas.

    劈山造海的英雄凯歌
    ——读“英雄人民战斗在十三陵水库”
    郭野
    在十三陵水库建设的过程中，英雄的建设者们创造了惊人的奇迹，写下了壮丽的诗篇。工地上，到处是激动人心的英雄事迹，到处是气势豪壮的诗歌创作。北京出版社新出版的“英雄人民战斗在十三陵水库”（十三陵水库修建总指挥部政治部、北京市文联合编）就是工地上涌现的千万篇诗歌的一部分。这本诗歌集，收集了一百多首民谣、诗歌，概括地表现了水库建设者的冲天的革命干劲和劈山造海的伟大力量，特别值得提出的是：这本诗歌集，绝大部分是水库建设者自己的创作，绝大部分是民歌、民谣。
    请听水库建设者的豪言壮语：“英雄子弟英雄胆，革命志气高如天，豪言壮语惊世界，发誓跑在洪水前。”英雄们要“筑起拦河坝”，也要“推倒影壁山”，英雄们要让十三陵的“荒山披绿装”，也要让“燕北变江南”，像这样的豪迈歌声，在工地处处可以听到。在困难面前，在风砂严寒面前，水库建设者也表现了无比的英勇气概：“吊睛猛虎怕武松，自古困难怕英雄，咱们都是英雄汉，吓得困难影无踪。”当铜墙般的大坝即将建成，当英雄们为水库建下了不朽的功劳，英雄们都万口同声地唱出了衷心的赞歌：“拦洪坝上一粒沙，大海中间小水花，个人功劳算个啥，党的功劳比天大！”这不仅是水库建设者的衷心赞歌，这也是全国人民的衷心赞歌。
    在水库建设一个高潮接着一个高潮的日子，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和党中央其他领导同志来到工地参加义务劳动，这给十三陵水库增加了无比的光辉，给水库建设者带来了巨大的鼓舞。在沸腾的工地，水库建设者和作家、诗人们激动地写下了热情的颂歌：“人人兴奋喜如狂，个个干劲喷泉涌，劳动热情达高潮，毛主席来到十三陵。”当毛主席和其他领导同志离开工地后，工地掀起了更高的劳动热潮。正如诗人所歌唱的：“他的笑声还在，铁锹上留下他的温暖；看今夜拦河大坝，将猛升三尺三！”
    震动世界的十三陵水库即将胜利完工，让我们感谢党的英明领导和领袖的亲切关怀，让我们感谢英雄的水库建设者，他们为我们创造了幸福乐园，写下了劈山造海的英雄凯歌。
