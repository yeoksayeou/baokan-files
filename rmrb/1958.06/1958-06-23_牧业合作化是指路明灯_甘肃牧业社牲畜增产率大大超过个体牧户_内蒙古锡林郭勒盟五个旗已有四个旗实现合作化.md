Pastoral Cooperativization is a Guiding Light
	Livestock Production Increase Rate of Gansu Pastoral Cooperatives Greatly Exceeds Individual Herdsmen
	Four Out of Five Banners in Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia, Have Achieved Cooperativization

	(Reported by this newspaper) A socialist wind is blowing everywhere in the pastoral areas of Gansu Province, and ethnic minority people are enthusiastically joining pastoral cooperatives. Up to now, 12,683 pastoral and agricultural households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 50% of the total pastoral and agricultural households in the pastoral areas; more than 380,000 head of livestock have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 25.3% of the total livestock in the pastoral areas. Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, which has made the fastest progress, has 85% of its population joining cooperatives and 65% of its livestock joining cooperatives, basically achieving pastoral cooperativization.
	The pastoral areas of Gansu Province mainly include Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, Subei Mongolian Autonomous County, Aksay Kazakh Autonomous County, Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, and Luqu and Maqu counties in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.
	According to reports from various regions, the organization of pastoral cooperatives by ethnic minority herdsmen in pastoral areas has shown great superiority in recent years: first, it has enabled the rapid development of animal husbandry. According to the distribution results of 52 cooperatives in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County last year, all of them increased production compared with individual herdsmen, of which 19 cooperatives increased production by 25%—30%, 9 cooperatives increased by 10%—15%, and 24 cooperatives, although severely affected by natural disasters, still had a higher increase rate than individual herdsmen. Second, after the formation of pastoral cooperatives, labor can be uniformly allocated, giving full play to the specialties of the members, and solving the difficulty of insufficient manpower, which is even more acute than in agricultural areas. According to a survey by the Kufeng Cooperative in Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, labor savings reached 35% after the formation of the cooperative compared with the period of individual farmers, and the shortage of manpower before the establishment of the cooperative was transformed into a surplus of labor. After the construction of this cooperative, the surplus labor was used to operate sideline industries, and the income from sideline industries in 1957 alone increased by 11.6% compared with before the establishment of the cooperative. Third, the formation of pastoral cooperatives has created favorable conditions for carrying out basic construction in animal husbandry. In 1957, the Tuanjie Cooperative in Subei Mongolian Autonomous County dug five springs on the arid grassland to fight drought and prevent drought, built six flood pools, drilled three wells, and planted 418 mu of forage grass and feed, solving the water and grass difficulties of more than 5,000 head of livestock, which was completely impossible in the past. Fourth, pastoral cooperativization has promoted the settlement and rotational grazing of herdsmen. In Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, more than 400 new houses were built after the establishment of the cooperative in 1956. For example, in the Hejiadun Pastoral Cooperative in this county, the number of children attending school after settlement has more than doubled compared with before.

	(Reported by this newspaper) The pastoral cooperativization movement on the Xilin Gol Grassland in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made rapid progress in the past one or two months. As of May 25, the number of pastoral cooperatives has increased from 37 to 300. Four out of the five banners have basically achieved pastoral cooperativization, and the number of pastoral households joining cooperatives in the entire league has increased from 6% at the end of last year to 70%. The number of joint state-private ranches has also increased from four to thirty-one.
	The rapid development of pastoral cooperativization in Xilin Gol League is a direct result of the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement. After the socialist education movement, the political consciousness of the vast number of herdsmen has been generally improved, and they have realized that to develop animal husbandry, they must take the socialist road, and actively demanded to establish cooperatives. Party and government leading organs at all levels have strengthened their leadership in accordance with this situation. The first secretaries of each banner party committee are all served by members of the League Party Committee or League-level cadres, which has greatly strengthened the leadership at the grassroots level; the entire league has also trained more than 700 cooperativization backbones and cadres for running cooperatives and ranches.

### 牧业合作化是指路明灯  甘肃牧业社牲畜增产率大大超过个体牧户  内蒙古锡林郭勒盟五个旗已有四个旗实现合作化

    牧业合作化是指路明灯
    甘肃牧业社牲畜增产率大大超过个体牧户
    内蒙古锡林郭勒盟五个旗已有四个旗实现合作化
    本报讯  甘肃省牧区到处吹遍了社会主义之风，少数民族人民踊跃加入牧业合作社。到现在为止，已入社牧户、农户一万二千六百八十三户，占牧区总牧户农户的50％；入社牲畜三十八万多头，占牧区牲畜总数的25.3％。进展最快的天祝藏族自治县，入社人数达85％，入社牲畜达65％，已基本实现了牧业合作化。
    甘肃省牧区主要包括肃南裕固族自治县、肃北蒙古族自治县、阿克塞哈萨克族自治县、天祝藏族自治县以及甘南藏族自治州的碌曲、玛曲等县。
    根据各地报告，牧区少数民族牧民这几年来组织牧业社已显示了很大的优越性：首先是使畜牧业有了迅速发展。天祝藏族自治县去年五十二个社分配结果，全部比个体牧户增产，其中十九个社增产25％—30％，九个社增10％—15％，二十四个社虽受严重自然灾害，但增加率仍高于个体牧户。其次，组成牧业社以后，因为劳力可以统一调配，发挥了社员特长，解决了比农业区更为紧张的人力不足的困难。根据肃南裕固族自治县库丰社的调查，组成社以后比个体农户时期节省人力达35％，由建社前人力不足转为劳力有余。这个社建成后用剩余劳力经营副业，仅1957年副业收入即比建社前增长11.6％。第三，组成牧业社以后，为畜牧业进行基本建设创造了有利条件。肃北蒙古族自治县团结社，1957年在干旱草原上为抗旱防旱淘泉五眼，修涝池六个，打井三眼，种饲草饲料四百一十八亩，解决了五千多头牲畜的水草困难，这在过去是完全不可能做到的事情。第四，牧业合作化促进了牧民定居轮牧。肃南裕固族自治县1956年建社后，新修房屋四百多间，如这个县的贺家墩牧业社，定居后入学儿童即比以前增加了两倍多。

    本报讯  内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒大草原上的牧业合作化运动，近一两个月来有了飞跃进展。到5月25日止，牧业社已由三十七个发展到三百个，五个旗中已有四个旗基本上实现了牧业合作化，全盟入社的牧户已由去年底的6％发展到70％。公私合营牧场也由四个发展到三十一个。
    锡林郭勒盟牧业合作化的飞跃发展，是整风和社会主义教育运动的直接结果。广大牧民经过社会主义教育运动，政治觉悟普遍提高，认清了要发展畜牧业就必须走社会主义道路，积极要求办社。各级党政领导机关根据这一形势，加强了领导工作。各旗委的第一书记都由盟委委员或者盟级干部担任，大大加强了基层领导；全盟还训练了七百多名合作化骨干和办社办场干部。
