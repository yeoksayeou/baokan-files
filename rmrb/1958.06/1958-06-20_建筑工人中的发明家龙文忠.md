    Inventor Long Wenzhong Among Construction Workers

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Wuhan) Long Wenzhong, an assistant technician at the Wuhan Fourth Construction Engineering Company, dares to think and boldly innovate technology. Over the past eight years, he has continuously invented more than forty kinds of construction tools, becoming a banner of technological innovation among construction workers in Wuhan.

    Long Wenzhong is thirty years old this year and only had one year of schooling. In the past, he was an ordinary bricklayer and mechanic. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, he was promoted to assistant technician. Because he dares to think and act, and diligently studies hard, he has not only created many simple tools, but also invented more than ten complex machines such as the "electric grout extrusion wall building machine." The characteristics of these machines he created are generally low cost and high efficiency. The automatic spraying machine he invented has an efficiency that is one hundred and fifteen times higher than manual operation. The "electric grout extrusion wall building machine" he invented has mechanized wall building, with one machine able to replace the labor of eight people, capable of laying more than 16,000 bricks per day. The tools invented by Long Wenzhong have been widely promoted in many construction sites in China and have been warmly welcomed. The "movable mortar extrusion tool" he created costs only eight yuan each, but its efficiency is doubled compared to the original. Moreover, the quality of work is guaranteed.

    The reason why Long Wenzhong was able to achieve such great achievements is first and foremost because he broke with superstition in his thinking, dared to think and act, and was not afraid of difficulties. When he was creating the "electric grout extrusion wall building machine," some people said, "Foreign experts have been inventing it for many years without success. You can't even draw a blueprint, how can you succeed?" But he still persevered with full confidence. He worked on it for five years, and after dozens of failures, he finally succeeded. In his invention and creation work, the Party and government leaders of the Wuhan Fourth Construction Engineering Company gave great support and encouragement. When Long Wenzhong encountered difficulties and his thinking wavered, the Party leaders would promptly talk to him to strengthen his confidence. The company also designated a special person to manufacture the parts for his machine; the company provided the necessary funds in a timely manner, and specially set up training classes and experimental construction sites to promote his inventions and improvements. Therefore, his inventions became more and more numerous and better and better. (Attached picture)

    建筑工人中的发明家龙文忠
    本报武汉讯　武汉市第四建筑工程公司助理技师龙文忠敢想敢作大胆革新技术，八年来连续发明创造了四十多种建筑施工工具，成为武汉市建筑工人中一面技术革新的旗帜。
    龙文忠今年三十岁，只读过一年书。过去是一个普通的泥瓦工和机械修理工，解放后在党的培养下，被提为助理技师。由于他敢想敢干，勤学苦钻，不仅创造了许多的简单工具，而且还发明了“电动挤浆砌墙机”等复杂的十多种机器。他创造的这些机器的特点，一般都是成本低、效率高。他发明的自动喷灰机，效率比手工操作提高了一百十五倍。他发明的“电动挤浆砌墙机”使砌墙由手工操作走向机械化，一部机器能顶八个人的劳动，每天能砌砖一万六千多块。龙文忠发明创造的工具在国内很多建筑工地已广泛推广，并受到热烈欢迎。他创造的“活动沙浆挤浆器”每个成本只八元，但效率比原来却提高一倍。而且工作质量得到了保证。
    龙文忠所以能够获得这样巨大成就，首先是思想上打破了迷信，敢想敢作不怕困难。在他创造“电动挤浆砌墙机”时，有的人曾说，“外国的专家发明多年都没成功，你连个图纸都画不好这怎能成功。”但他仍然是信心百倍地坚持作下去。一直干了五年，经过几十次的失败最后终于成功了。在他的发明创造的工作上，武汉第四建筑工程公司党政领导给了很大的支持和鼓励。当龙文忠遇到困难思想动摇时，党的领导人就及时找他谈话，坚定他的信心。公司并指定专人为他制造机器的零件；所需经费公司及时供给，并且专为推广他发明创造和改进的工具开办了训练班，设立了试验工地。因此，使他的发明创造越来越多，并且越来越好。（附图片）
