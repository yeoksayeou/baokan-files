Why are the Abettors of the Enemies of People's Hungary Alarmed?
Soviet "Pravda" Editorial Department
Recently, officials in the United States and other Western countries have once again stirred up a wave of opposition against the Hungarian People's Republic and all socialist countries, targeting the Hungarian Supreme Court's verdict on the case of Imre Nagy, the traitor to the Hungarian people, and his accomplices. Reactionary newspapers have also launched such an offensive. Fascists in certain capitalist countries have continuously provoked the diplomatic missions of the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union, and constantly attacked the offices of communist and other progressive organizations. These provocative actions are organized, with the mobs sheltered by the police and authorities.

It is impossible not to notice that the tactics of imperialist forces have recently become increasingly similar to their tactics in the autumn of 1956, when the reactionaries of the United States, Britain, and France stirred up a frenzy around the Hungarian incident, and the three countries of Britain, France, and Israel launched an aggression against Egypt, attempting to bury the country's independence and strike at the entire national liberation movement of the Eastern peoples. As everyone knows, at the same time, a reactionary offensive was launched against the Communist Party and the working class in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other capitalist countries.

At that time in 1956, the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary were quickly defeated, and the peace-loving people of all countries firmly opposed the three countries' aggression against Egypt. The working people of Western Europe launched a selfless struggle against fascist provocations, and as a result, the imperialist conspiracy was shattered.

Since then, many changes have taken place in the world. The power of the socialist camp has been developed and consolidated as never before.

Despite the imperialist political chiefs' bragging about having provoked a "crisis of communism," the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries is now more consolidated than ever before. Even the enemies of communism admit this (albeit in their own way). The British Conservative newspaper "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" wrote in November 1957, commenting on the most important programmatic document of modern communism—the Declaration formulated at the Moscow meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of twelve socialist countries: "Who could have predicted last November, at the height of the Hungarian and Polish events, that all Communist Parties, except Yugoslavia, would agree to sign a declaration on common goals?" Reactionary newspapers such as the "New York Times" also talked about "Communist unity" and the "organized solidarity" of the communist movement. The unwavering implementation of the principles of proletarian internationalism and the loyalty of all fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties to the glorious fighting banner of Marxism-Leninism are the decisive conditions for the further unity of the entire socialist camp.

The Soviet Union's peaceful policy, the specific proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions, and the growth of economic cooperation between socialist countries and Asian and African countries have all contributed to strengthening the spirit of peaceful coexistence. The Bandung principles have captured the hearts of hundreds of millions of people in various countries. The strength of the national liberation movement is flourishing not only in Asia, but also in Africa and Latin America. The powerful international movement to defend peace, oppose the atomic threat, oppose military blocs and the "Cold War" has also grown.

At the same time, the imperialist world and its main fortress, the United States, are facing an economic crisis. Within capitalist countries, the working people have strengthened their struggle against the offensive of monopoly capital.

Therefore, the reactionary Western bloc has reason to fear the normalization of international life and the end of the "Cold War." Regarding these reasons, the American journalist Dorothy Thompson recently wrote in the "Star" that for decades, the factor of American industrial prosperity has been "expenditures on real wars, cold wars, and war preparations... War and war preparations have become America's biggest business. The business activities of the Air Force Department alone exceed the business activities of America's four largest companies. This is the main item of export." The United States is "unwilling to let any fundamental disarmament damage the interests of the stock exchange and create lines of unemployed people receiving charitable relief..."

It is precisely at this time, when various crisis phenomena strongly overshadow the American economy, that it is extremely important for American big capitalists to maintain a tense international situation. Establishing a normal environment will inevitably lead to the restoration of normal economic life and the expansion of business contacts between Western countries and the countries of the socialist camp. Arms manufacturers are well aware that under normal international economic relations, their goods will not receive priority. Military bases, arms exports, and arms supplies will no longer be as profitable as they are now. The "Wall Street Journal" shamelessly and openly declared: "There is no doubt that many industrialists are hoping that the restoration of international tension can increase defense spending..."

The American press frankly stated that the case of Imre Nagy is a good excuse to bury the high-level talks that may lead to the easing of international tensions. "New York Times" reporter Dotty wrote that the current situation "should be used, as some people believe, to convince the entire Western world that the cautious diplomatic policy pursued by Secretary of State Dulles is wise." As everyone knows, this policy is the "brink of war" policy that the Western countries have long been unable to pursue and that has been most resolutely condemned by all peace-loving people in the world.

"New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lippmann, describing the position of some people in the United States, wrote that these people's "purpose is to push the Russians back out of Europe... push them out of most of Africa and Asia—and, if possible, restore them to their pre-war status."

It is not difficult to see that this "purpose" is nothing more than repeating the old policy that has long gone bankrupt, that is, the adventurous policy of infringing on socialist countries and undermining their friendly relations with independent countries in Asia and Africa.

For those who dream of realizing this arrogant "purpose," we can give them a piece of old advice: have a glass of cold water and wake up, gentlemen! If this does not work for them, then the lovers of war adventures should understand that socialist countries possess all the necessary forces to stop any aggressor and once and for all dispel their thoughts of infringing on the socialist camp.

This is how Western monopoly groups are attempting to seek a way out of economic and political difficulties through new war adventures.

In recent months, the imperialist blocs of the United States and other Western countries have adopted new attempts to undermine the independent policies of countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon. Bourgeois newspapers in the United States and other countries have launched a propaganda offensive against the governments and certain leaders of these countries under the guise of "anti-communism."

Currently, the situation in the Arab East is extremely tense. Imperialist countries are on the verge of armed intervention in Lebanon. The Lebanese people are fighting for independence and against the notorious "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine." In front of the gates of Lebanon, a large number of American and British naval and air forces are concentrated, waiting for the signal to land. American, British, and French weapons are continuously transported into Lebanon. The aggressive Baghdad Pact system has been activated. Israeli troops are on standby on the Lebanese border. The United States and Britain insist on sending United Nations "observers" to Lebanon, attempting to use the banner of this international organization to conceal preparations for armed intervention. Imperialist armed intervention in Lebanon means establishing a unified military line of colonialists from Lebanon to Algeria, which may extend deep into Africa and Asia in the future. This armed intervention poses a serious threat to the independence of all Asian countries.

It is precisely in order to divert the attention of the world's public from their planned aggression that imperialist countries have been clamoring about the trial of Imre Nagy and inciting boundless "anti-communist" hysteria. The US State Department is mourning the traitor of the Hungarian people, while in Lebanon, weapons provided by the Americans are killing patriotic fighters. An Associated Press reporter reported that the United States wants to "quickly convene" the so-called "UN Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" to "discuss" the verdict on the traitor Imre Nagy. British government officials, who are responsible for the bloodshed in Kenya and elsewhere, are also mourning this event. The spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs also praised these servants of imperialism, naively believing that the world has forgotten the heinous crimes committed by French colonialists in Algeria.

In order to achieve their selfish goals, the Western aggressor bloc is doing everything possible to complicate the international situation, reignite the "Cold War," undermine high-level talks, and prepare for open military adventures whenever there is an opportunity. American and British monopoly groups believe that this adventurous policy is their "savior" from the increasingly serious economic crisis. They believe that this would make it possible to suppress the broad democratic movements in their countries that are striving for peace and social progress. It is precisely for this reason that the Western reactionary bloc is hysterically clamoring about the fact that the Imre Nagy treasonous group received the punishment they deserved. The Hungarian people justly punished the traitors, and everyone understands that this is the internal affair of the Hungarian people, and no one has the right to interfere. And the opponents of easing international tensions are clamoring about the case of the Hungarian traitors, which exposes their true colors.

The conspiracy of the imperialist bloc to threaten peace and the security of all peoples is being resolutely countered by the democratic forces of all countries.

The working masses of the West and the East understand that the purpose of this slander of the Hungarian People's Republic and other socialist countries by the reactionaries is not only against these countries, but also against all progressive forces in capitalist countries.

The French "L'Humanité" wrote, "Some people are undermining the unity of all democratic forces to jointly defeat fascism. These people are trying to find reasons for their actions in the internal affairs of Hungary—the verdict in Budapest. But nothing can justify this trick, which can only be used by the enemies of the republic." "L'Humanité" exposed the conspiracy of Western countries to use the current situation to undermine high-level talks. The newspaper pointed out, "Everyone knows that Western countries have long been hostile to talks with the Soviet Union. A new excuse has been added in addition to a series of fabricated excuses."

Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti commented on the verdict in the Imre Nagy group case in an interview with "Corriere della Sera": "Although the so-called Western group led by the United States was defeated in 1956, they still want to start with Hungary and make it their demand and main goal to eliminate the people's and socialist system in Eastern European countries. There has not been the slightest sign of easing in this tension until now. Therefore, those who are howling for the verdict in Budapest are in many cases hypocrites, because many of these people have not only consistently welcomed activities to subvert the people's and socialist system, but may have also directly participated in this activity."

The British "Daily Worker" wrote about the West's slander campaign: "Active activists in the British labor movement should not be confused by this trick. It is a good thing that traitors, reactionaries, and fascists have failed in Hungary. The world is more peaceful because the People's Democratic system of Hungary continues to exist."

The progressive newspapers of capitalist countries exposed the tricks of the reactionaries and called on the working people to be vigilant and prepare to counter any attempt to deceive the people and prevent them from solving the most important task of the moment—preventing the threat of atomic war and consolidating world peace.

The public in socialist countries unanimously supports the just verdict on the traitors of the Hungarian people. This support once again embodies the rock-solid unity. In the past socialist camp countries were united in this way to assist the Hungarian people to smash the counter-revolution, to assist them to continue to successfully build socialism in the Hungarian People's Republic.

The socialist camp countries are also united in countering the conspiracies of the imperialist forces that threaten peace and the security of all peoples. Beijing's "People's Daily" wrote: "The American imperialists who are viciously invading Lebanon and Indonesia and stubbornly refusing to hold a summit meeting are attacking socialist countries and expressing sympathy for the Nagy group, which best illustrates the true meaning of the Nagy group's counter-revolutionary betrayal."

The Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp have exposed and will continue to expose the enemies of peace. We must expose such people: they slander and wave the black flag of "anti-communism", attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, sow seeds of hostility and hatred among the people of all countries, and launch a "Cold War". Faithful to the principles of Lenin's international peace policy, the Soviet Union, together with all countries of the socialist camp, will continue to make every effort to strengthen international security, ease international tensions, and safeguard world peace.

    人民匈牙利的敌人的包庇者为什么惊慌？
    苏联“真理报”编辑部
    美国和其他西方国家的官方人士最近针对匈牙利最高法院对匈牙利人民的叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同伙的案件的判决又掀起了一股反对匈牙利人民共和国和一切社会主义国家的浪潮。反动报纸也展开了这样的攻势。某些资本主义国家的法西斯分子不断对匈牙利人民共和国和苏联的外交代表机构进行挑衅，不断袭击共产党及其他进步组织的办事处。这些挑衅行动是有组织地进行的，暴徒们受到警察和当局的庇护。
    不能不注意到，近来帝国主义势力的策略越来越像他们在1956年秋天的策略，当时美国、英国和法国的反动派围绕着匈牙利事件掀起了疯狂的喧嚣，英、法和以色列三国向埃及发动了侵略，企图埋葬这个国家的独立，打击东方人民的整个民族解放运动。大家知道，与此同时，开始向共产党、向法国、荷兰、比利时以及其他资本主义国家的工人阶级发动了反动的攻势。
    1956年那个时候，很快地击溃了匈牙利的反革命势力，各国爱好和平的人民坚决反对了三个国家对埃及的侵略，西欧的劳动人民对法西斯挑衅行为展开了奋不顾身的斗争，结果粉碎了帝国主义的阴谋。
    从那时候起，世界上发生了很多变化。社会主义阵营的威力有了空前的发展和巩固。
    尽管帝国主义政治头目们大吹大擂说，他们已经挑起了“共产主义危机”，但是，社会主义各国共产党和工人党的团结现在比任何时候都巩固了。就是共产主义的敌人也承认（尽管按他们自己的方式承认）这一点。英国保守党报纸“每日电讯与晨邮报”1957年11月在评述十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议制定的现代共产主义的最重要的纲领性文件——宣言时写道：“有谁能够在去年11月匈牙利和波兰事件高潮的时候预言，除了南斯拉夫以外，一切共产党都会同意签署一项关于共同目标的宣言呢。”像“纽约时报”这样的反动报纸也谈论起“共产党的一致”，谈论起共产主义运动的“有组织的团结”来了。始终不渝地实行无产阶级国际主义原则，一切兄弟共产党和工人党对马克思列宁主义光荣的战斗的旗帜的忠诚，是整个社会主义阵营进一步团结的决定性条件。
    苏联的和平政策、苏联为缓和国际紧张局势而提出的具体建议、社会主义国家同亚非国家经济合作的增长，都有助于加强和平共处的精神。万隆原则掌握了各国千千万万人的心。民族解放运动的力量不仅在亚洲，而且在非洲和拉丁美洲蓬勃发展。保卫和平、反对原子威胁、反对军事集团和“冷战”的强大的国际运动也增长了。
    同时，帝国主义世界和它的主要堡垒美国却面临着经济危机。在资本主义国家内部，劳动人民加强了反对垄断资本进攻的斗争。
    因此，反动的西方集团害怕国际生活的正常化和“冷战”的结束是有原因的。关于这些原因，美国记者道乐赛·汤普逊最近在“明星报”上写道，几十年来，美国工业繁荣的因素是“用在真正战争、冷战和备战上的开销……战争和备战成了美国最大的生意。仅仅空军部一个部的企业活动就超过了美国四个最大公司的企业活动。这是出口的主要项目”。美国“不愿意让任何根本的裁军来损害证券交易所的利益和造成领取慈善救济的失业行列……”。
    正是在现在这个时候，当各种危机现象强烈地笼罩着美国的经济的时候，对于美国大资本家说来，保持紧张的国际局势是极端重要的。建立正常的环境，就必然要恢复正常的经济生活，并扩大西方国家同社会主义阵营各国之间的事务联系。军火制造商十分了解，在正常的国际经济关系的情况之下，他们的货物将得不到优先权。军事基地、军火输出、军备供应就不再会像现在这样是有利可图的营业了。“华尔街杂志”恬不知耻地公开宣称：“毫无疑问，很多工业家都在希望，恢复国际紧张局势就可以增加国防费用……”
    美国报刊十分坦白地说，纳吉·伊姆雷的案件是一个很好的借口，可以借此埋葬可能导致国际紧张局势缓和的高级会谈。“纽约时报”记者多蒂写道，当前的局势“像有些人所认为的那样，应该被利用来使得整个西方世界都相信国务卿杜勒斯所奉行的谨慎外交方针是明智的”。大家都知道，这种方针就是西方国家早已走不通的、并受到世界所有爱好和平人民最坚决谴责的“战争边缘”的方针。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员李普曼在描述美国某些人士的立场的时候写道，这些人的“目的是要把俄国人重新排挤出欧洲……排挤出非洲和亚洲大部分地区——如果可能的话，恢复到大战以前的地位”。
    不难看出，这种“目的”不过是重复早已破产了的旧政策，也就是侵犯社会主义国家、破坏它们同亚非独立国家友好联系的冒险政策。
    对于那些妄想实现这种狂妄“目的”的人，可以给他们一句老话做劝告：喝一杯凉水醒醒脑袋吧，先生们！如果这对他们还不发生作用，那么战争冒险的爱好者们应该明白，社会主义国家拥有一切必要的力量来制止任何侵略者，一次就能永远打消他们侵犯社会主义阵营的念头。
    西方国家垄断集团就是这样企图用新战争冒险的方法来寻求经济和政治困难的出路。
    最近几个月来，美国和其他西方国家的帝国主义集团采用了新的企图来破坏印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰这样一些国家的独立政策。美国和其他国家的资产阶级报纸在“反共”的幌子下，展开了针对这些国家的政府和某些领导人的宣传攻势。
    目前阿拉伯东方的局势极度紧张。帝国主义国家眼看马上就要对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。黎巴嫩人民正在为争取独立、反对臭名昭彰的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”而斗争。在黎巴嫩的大门前，集中着大批美国和英国的海军和空军，他们在等待登陆的信号。美国、英国和法国的武器源源不断地运入黎巴嫩。侵略性的巴格达条约体系开动起来了。以色列的军队在黎巴嫩边境枕戈待命。美国和英国坚持主张派遣联合国“观察员”去黎巴嫩，企图用这个国际组织的旗号来掩饰武装干涉的准备。帝国主义对黎巴嫩的武装干涉意味着建立一个从黎巴嫩到阿尔及利亚的殖民主义者的统一的军事战线，这条战线将来可能向非洲和亚洲纵深发展。这种武装干涉会对一切亚洲国家的独立造成严重威胁。
    正是为了转移全世界公众对他们准备侵略计划的注意力，帝国主义国家围绕着对纳吉·伊姆雷的审判大肆叫嚷，煽动无边无际的“反共”歇斯底里。美国国务院为匈牙利人民的叛徒哭丧，同时，在黎巴嫩，美国人提供的武器正在杀戮爱国志士。美联社记者报道，美国想“迅速召开”所谓“联合国匈牙利问题特别委员会”“讨论”对叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷的判决。英国政府人士，这些应对怯尼亚以及其他地方血流成河的惨象负责的人也在为这件事哭丧。法国外交部发言人也颂扬这些帝国主义的奴仆，他竟幼稚地认为，世界忘记了法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚所干下的滔天罪行。
    西方侵略集团为了达到自私的目的，想尽一切办法来使国际局势复杂化，重新煽起“冷战”，破坏高级谈判，一有机会就准备进行公开的军事冒险。美国和英国垄断集团认为，这种冒险政策是他们摆脱日益严重的经济危机的“救星”，他们认为这样就有可能镇压住本国争取和平和社会进步的广泛的民主运动。正是为了这个缘故，西方反动集团就对纳吉·伊姆雷叛国集团得到他们所应得的惩处这件事歇斯底里地吵嚷不休。匈牙利人民公正地惩处了叛徒，每个人都明白，这是匈牙利人民的内政，任何人都无权干涉。而缓和国际紧张局势的反对者围绕着匈牙利卖国贼的案件叫嚣，就暴露了他们的真面目。
    帝国主义集团威胁和平和各国人民安全的阴谋正遭到各国民主力量的坚决反击。
    西方和东方的劳动群众懂得，反动派这次对匈牙利人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的诬蔑，其目的依旧不仅仅是为了反对这些国家，而且也是反对资本主义国家中所有的进步力量。
    法国“人道报”写道，“某些人破坏一切民主力量团结起来以共同击溃法西斯主义，这些人企图在匈牙利的内部事务——布达佩斯的判决中为自己的做法寻找理由。但是，什么东西也不能说明这种诡计是正当的，这种诡计只能被共和制的敌人所利用”。“人道报”揭露了西方国家想利用当前局势来破坏高级会谈的阴谋，报纸指出：“大家知道，西方国家老早就对同苏联的会谈抱着敌对态度。在一连串伪造的借口之外又增添了一个新的借口”。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂对“国家晚报”记者谈话时评论对纳吉·伊姆雷集团案件的判决说：“尽管美国领导的所谓西方集团在1956年遭到了失败，但是他们现在仍然想从匈牙利开始，把消灭东欧国家的人民的、社会主义的制度作为他们的要求和主要目标。直到现在还没有一点点迹象表明这方面的紧张局势有所缓和。因此，那些为布达佩斯的判决而嚎叫的人在许多情况下都是伪君子，因为这些人之中有不少人不仅一贯欢迎颠覆人民的、社会主义的制度的活动，而且还可能直接参与了这个活动”。
    英国“工人日报”关于西方的诽谤运动写道：“英国工人运动的积极活动家不应该因这种诡计而受到迷惑。叛徒、反动分子和法西斯分子在匈牙利失败了，这是好事。世界由于匈牙利的人民民主制度继续存在而更为安宁”。
    资本主义国家的进步报刊揭露了反动派的诡计，号召劳动人民提高警惕，准备反击任何想欺骗人民、使人民不去解决当前最重要的任务——防止原子战争的威胁、巩固世界和平的企图。
    社会主义国家公众一致支持对匈牙利人民的叛徒的公正判决。这个支持再一次体现了磐石般的团结，当年社会主义阵营各国就曾经这样团结一致地援助匈牙利人民粉碎了反革命，援助他们继续胜利地在匈牙利人民共和国建设社会主义。
    社会主义阵营国家同样在一致地反击威胁和平和各国人民安全的帝国主义势力的阴谋。北京“人民日报”写道：“凶恶地侵略黎巴嫩和印度尼西亚，顽固地拒绝最高级会议的美帝国主义者出来对社会主义国家大肆攻击，对纳吉集团表示同情，最能够说明纳吉集团反革命叛变的真正意义究竟是什么。”
  苏联和社会主义阵营所有国家过去揭穿了，将来仍然要揭穿和平的敌人。要揭穿这样的人：他们进行诽谤和打起“反共”的黑旗，企图干涉其他国家的内政，在各国人民之间撒下敌视和仇恨的种子，发动“冷战”。忠实于列宁国际和平政策的原则的苏联，今后仍将同社会主义阵营各国一起，尽一切努力来加强国际安全，缓和国际紧张局势和保障世界和平。
