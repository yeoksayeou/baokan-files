Compiling Lectures on the Theory of State and Law

The Teaching and Research Section of the Theory of State and Law of the Renmin University of China has initially written a new lecture book, "Refuting the Rightist Fallacies on the Theory of State and Law," in the process of teaching reform. This book has now been publicly published by the Renmin University of China Press. The entire book has made significant changes to the three-part, eighteen-chapter teaching system and content that has been consistently used in the past. It uses the article "Marxist-Leninist Theory of State and Law is a Powerful Weapon for Crushing the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Conspiracy of the Bourgeois Rightists" as a preface, followed by three special topics: the class nature of state and law, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the socialist legal system. The focus of the lectures is on the dictatorship of the proletariat, the socialist legal system, and the leading role of the Party. This book better implements the spirit of integrating theory with practice. It focuses on Chinese issues and closely combines the criticism of rightist fallacies with the criticism of old legal viewpoints, modern revisionist viewpoints, and various right-leaning thoughts.

    编写国家和法的理论问题的讲义
    中国人民大学国家与法权理论教研室在教学改革过程中，初步写出了一本新的讲义——“在国家和法的理论问题上驳斥右派谬论”。这本书现已由中国人民大学出版社公开出版。全书将过去一贯采用的三篇十八章的讲授体系和内容作了很大的变动。它以“马克思列宁主义国家与法的理论是粉碎资产阶级右派反党反社会主义阴谋的有力武器”一文作为前言，下边共讲述了三个专题，即国家和法的阶级性、无产阶级专政和社会主义法制。讲授的重点是无产阶级专政、社会主义法制和党的领导作用。这本书比较好地贯彻了理论联系实际的精神。它以中国问题为重点，并且紧密结合批判右派谬论批判了旧法观点、现代修正主义观点和各种右倾思想。　（旭华）
