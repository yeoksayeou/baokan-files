    Commercial Work Great Revolution in Fengjie County, Sichuan
    Salespeople Proficient in Commerce, Agriculture, and Industry

    (Our Correspondents Wang Huandou and Liu Zongtang) Commercial workers in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, have broken the old rules of only managing commodity circulation and not engaging in commodity production, and have established more than 400 factories, carrying out a great revolution in commercial work. Their slogan is "Three Proficiencies and Three Roles": not only proficient in commerce and agricultural technology, but also in industry; not only acting as salespeople, but also as producers and technicians.
    During the rectification movement, the commercial departments of Fengjie County swept away the "three winds and five airs," criticized erroneous viewpoints such as "business first" and "profit first," put politics in command, adjusted the commercial network, and changed unreasonable rules and regulations, so that commerce was closely integrated with agricultural production, actively participating in agricultural production and learning agricultural technology. On the basis of a series of commercial reforms, a further debate was launched on the question of whether commercial departments could engage in industry. Some people believed that "engaging in other industries is not doing one's job properly and will affect one's own work." However, the majority of people emancipated their minds and believed that everything should be based on specific conditions, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, whatever needs to be done should be done; commercial departments also have considerable potential to create wealth, and can further cooperate with various departments and make up for the shortcomings of township and commune-run industries; commercial systems running industries are also convenient for supply and marketing, and there are many benefits. As long as proper arrangements are made, proficiency in commerce, agriculture, and industry can be fully combined, which is beneficial to commercial work in every way.
    The latter view received strong support from the Fengjie County Party Committee and the leaders of the commercial system. In February of this year, the county's commercial workers launched a wave of enthusiasm for running industries, adopting a method of combining commercial networks going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, agricultural technology going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, and factories going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, engaging in both commerce, agricultural technical guidance, and industry. The supply and marketing cooperatives alone extracted 240 cadres and organized 860 small vendors to carry goods, repair tools, chisels, gunpowder, ropes, etc., while purchasing and repairing farm tools for farmers, testing soil properties, and imparting technology for sideline production, while looking for mines, resources, and preparing to run factories. They not only acted as salespeople and technicians in mountain villages, but also often traveled between the deep mountains and old forests, "rising before dawn, resting under the moonlight, chiseling mines in the air, and descending cliffs along ropes, refining mines whenever they saw them." They successively discovered more than 400 mines of gold, silver, copper, lead, sulfur, etc., and also found more than 20,000 lacquer trees, more than 100 kinds of fiber raw materials, and precious medicinal materials such as Codonopsis pilosula and Kalopanax septemlobus. The commercial system also held industrial production technology training classes, rotating cadres for training without affecting business. Now, more than 80 people have learned the technology of rayon production alone. Each person who has undergone technical training then takes one to three apprentices in their spare time, so that the technology can be popularized. In the past three months, chemical fertilizer factories, iron factories, rayon factories, coal mines, etc., run by the commercial system have emerged one after another, producing 127 kinds of products. After the factories started production, salespeople bought and sold goods when there were many customers, and when there were few customers, they drew people to agricultural cooperatives to provide technical guidance or engage in industrial production. They organized many mobile teams, setting up retail departments, agricultural technology guidance stations, and factories wherever they went, and everyone became a "triple role."
    The situation in the past three months shows that the political and economic significance of this approach is enormous. Because they make the commercial network, agricultural technology, and factories go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, the masses can sell their ores and wild plants to them on the spot, and at the same time buy back the means of production and means of living they need. Because they turn "waste" into good products and create a lot of wealth, this year they can produce 1,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 580,000 catties of oil, 3 million catties of rayon, and a large number of farm tools, etc. Because wild plants are used to make wine, this year they can also save the country 12 million catties of grain.
    The situation in the previous three months also shows that this not only did not affect commercial work, but on the contrary, because the masses can exchange "waste" for money, the purchasing power of rural areas has increased, and the turnover has increased by about half compared with the same period last year. This also makes the combination of supply, production and sales more direct, and greatly reduces commodity costs and prices. For example, the price of self-made copper sulfate is 50% lower than that supplied by Chongqing, which can save farmers more than 100,000 yuan a year. In the past, many daily necessities were raw materials transferred from other places to the local area, and after processing and production, they were transported back for sale, and the price was very high. Now that they are self-produced, the price is one-third cheaper.

    四川奉节县商业工作大革命
    营业员通商通农又通工
    本报讯  记者王焕斗、刘宗棠报道：四川省奉节县的商业工作人员打破只管商品流转，不搞商品生产的陈规，跨行办了四百多个工厂，进行商业工作大革命。他们的口号是“三通三员”：不仅通商通农业技术，而且要通工；不仅当营业员，而且要当生产员和技术员。”
    奉节县商业部门在整风运动中，横扫三风五气，批判“业务挂帅”、“利润挂帅”等错误观点，政治挂了帅，调整了商业网，改变了不合理的规章制度，使商业与农业生产紧密结合起来，积极参加农业生产，学习农业技术。在进行了一系列商业改革工作的基础上，进一步对商业部门能否搞工业的问题展开了大辩论。有些人认为“跨行是不务正业，会影响本身工作”。但是大多数人思想解放了，认为一切要从具体条件出发，在党委统一领导下，需要做什么就做什么；商业部门也有不少潜力可以用来创造财富，可以跟各个部门进一步协作和弥补乡、社办工业力所不及之处；商业系统办工业，也便于供销，好处很多，只要妥善安排，通商、通农、通工完全可以结合，对商业工作有百利而无一弊。
    后一种看法得到了中共奉节县委和商业系统领导上的大力支持。全县商业工作人员在今年2月就掀起了办工业的热潮，采取商业网上山下乡、农业技术上山下乡与工厂上山下乡相结合的办法，既务商又进行农业技术指导，又务工。仅供销社就抽出二百四十名干部，组织八百六十名小商贩带着货物、修理用的工具、凿子、火药、绳索等，一边收购一边为农民修理农具、化验土壤性质、传授副业生产技术，一边找矿、找资源和筹办工厂。他们不仅在山村中当营业员和技术员，还常常辗转在深山老林之间，“披星而起，戴月而息，悬空凿矿，沿绳下崖，见矿就炼”。他们先后发现了金、银、铜、铅、硫磺等四百多个矿，还找出了二万多棵漆树、一百多种纤维原料和党参、梦花皮等名贵药材。商业系统又举办了工业生产技术训练班，在不影响营业的情况下，轮训干部，现在仅学了人造棉生产技术的就有八十多人。每个经过技术训练的人，回去后又抽空带一个到三个徒弟，使技术得以普及。三个月来，商业系统办的化学肥料厂、铁厂、人造棉厂、煤矿等，一个紧接一个出现，制出产品达一百二十七种。工厂开工生产以后，营业员们在顾客多的时候买卖货物，顾客少的时候就抽人到农业社进行技术指导或搞工业生产。他们组织了很多流动小组，走到哪里就在哪里设立门市部、农业技术指导站和工厂，人人当了“三员”。
    以往三个月的情况表明，这种做法的政治意义和经济意义非常巨大。由于他们使商业网、农业技术和工厂上山下乡，群众可以就地把矿石、野生植物卖给他们，并在同时买回所需的生产资料和生活资料。由于他们把“废物”变成好货，创造了大量的财富，今年就可以制出一千吨化学肥料、五十八万斤油、三百万斤人造棉和大量农具等等。由于用野生植物酿酒，今年还可以为国家节省一千二百万斤粮食。
    前三个月的情况也表明，这样做不仅没有影响商业工作，相反地，却因为群众可以拿“废物”换钱，农村购买力提高，营业额比去年同时期增加了一半左右。这样做，还使供产销进一步直接结合，使商品成本和价格大大降低。如自制的硫酸铜的价格就比重庆供应的低50％，一年可使农民省出十多万元，许多日用品过去是本地外调原料，经过加工生产再运回来销售，价钱很高，现在自产以后，价格要便宜三分之一以上。
