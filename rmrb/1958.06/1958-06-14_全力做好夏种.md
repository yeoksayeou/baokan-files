Go All Out to Do a Good Job in Summer Planting

The Grain in Ear has passed, and the main wheat-producing areas of the country are in the midst of the busy summer harvest season, with the intensive summer planting following closely behind. While doing a good job in the summer harvest, pressing forward in victory and planting summer crops in a timely manner is of decisive significance for completing the annual production increase plan.

The national summer crop area reaches approximately 600 million mu, accounting for about one-quarter of the total annual crop sown area. Among these summer crops, about 170 million mu are for rice, which is about one-third of the national rice area, and rice seedlings should be transplanted at this time; about 120 million mu are for summer sweet potatoes, and summer-sown corn, accounting for about one-third of the national corn area, will be planted after the wheat harvest; in addition, soybeans and a large number of minor grains, miscellaneous beans, and oil crops, as well as economic crops such as tobacco, are also sown at this time. This year, in order to improve land utilization and increase cultivated land output, many places have expanded the area of multiple cropping and intercropping, and the area of double-cropping rice, wheat stubble rice, and wheat stubble sweet potatoes has been expanded even more. The planting of these crops requires a large amount of labor and needs to be completed as early as possible. This period is also a busy season for the wheat harvest and field management of autumn crops. All of this indicates that summer planting is an urgent and arduous task.

This year, various localities have built a large number of water conservancy projects, creating favorable conditions for early planting. However, in areas with poor water conservancy conditions, it is still necessary to be mentally prepared. If it does not rain after the wheat harvest, drought-resistant planting should be carried out immediately. Do not take chances and wait for rain to plant, which would delay the planting season. Experience in various localities over the years has proven that the key to determining the success or failure of summer crops is to race against time and plant as early as possible. Early planting not only ensures that crops have a sufficient growing period, which is conducive to increasing yields, but also frees up land early for timely wheat sowing or early autumn plowing. As the saying goes, "Strive for days in the spring, strive for time in the summer." We must be determined to race against time and resolutely achieve harvesting and planting simultaneously.

In order to achieve the goal of early planting, all localities should carefully summarize and promote the good experiences already existing among the masses, and improve and enhance summer crop cultivation techniques. During the crop growing season, we must resolutely ensure seedling preservation, ear preservation, and grain preservation. In the past, due to the tight summer planting time and insufficient labor and tools, planting was generally rough, without fertilization or plowing. In order to change this situation, we must vigorously improve the cultivation techniques of summer crops. Rice should be given sufficient base fertilizer, the field surface should be leveled, and dense and even transplanting should be carried out; sweet potatoes should be deeply plowed and ridged, fertilizer should be applied in layers, and strong seedlings should be shallowly transplanted; corn should be deeply plowed to retain moisture, sufficient base fertilizer should be applied, and early planting should increase plant density. Other crops such as millet and soybeans must also be deeply plowed and harrowed, with sufficient base fertilizer applied, and the prevention and control of underground pests should be strengthened to ensure full and vigorous seedlings.

During summer planting, the growth of spring-sown crops should be checked. In addition to grasping timely cultivation, weeding, and field management, a seedling checking and replanting campaign should be launched to eliminate second- and third-class seedlings. After the emergence of summer crops, time should be seized to conduct a comprehensive inspection. Missing seedlings should be replanted and transplanted as soon as possible, striving to ensure that there are no gaps in the rows and no missing seedlings in each row.

The amount of fertilizer accumulated in various localities this year has increased compared to previous years, but some areas have already applied most of the fertilizer to spring-sown crops and wheat fields, and the base fertilizer for summer crops is not sufficient, which is far from meeting the requirements of the production increase targets. At present, in addition to using a portion of the accumulated fertilizer for summer planting base fertilizer, we should vigorously increase fertilizer accumulation to prepare for early topdressing.

An important characteristic of this year's summer planting is the large increase in wheat stubble rice and wheat stubble sweet potatoes in the Huanghuai River basin. These two high-yield crops are of great importance to the leap forward in production in these areas, and we must do everything possible to complete the planting plan. In terms of rice, the first thing to do is to manage the seedlings well, and check whether the number of seedlings meets the needs of the field in order to adjust the seedlings in the future. Secondly, the ridges, dikes, and ditches should be built well, the land should be leveled well, and the fertilizer should be applied well. It is better to have the land waiting for the seedlings than to have the seedlings waiting for the land. Third, transplanting techniques should be taught well, and transplanting should be done early with appropriate density and depth, and high efficiency. In terms of sweet potatoes, the management of seedling beds and spring sweet potato fields should be strengthened, fertilizer should be increased, and irrigation should be carried out in a timely manner in order to provide more strong seedlings and meet the needs of expanding the planting of summer sweet potatoes.

This year's summer planting tasks are heavy, the requirements are high, the time is tight, and early planting is required. The shortage of labor and livestock has become a prominent problem. Therefore, labor and livestock arrangements must be made as early as possible, labor potential must be tapped, and men, women, old and young must be mobilized. Agricultural tasks that can be done before summer planting should be completed with concentrated efforts. The organization of labor should be based on the urgency of agricultural work in summer planting, and summer planting professional teams should be organized according to work needs and the specialties of commune members, each responsible for their specific tasks, and socialist labor competitions should be launched. Recently, many local agricultural cooperatives have established farm season canteens and temporary nurseries, which are very helpful in improving labor efficiency and solving women's family concerns.

Communist cooperation should be organized during summer planting, and all forces should be mobilized to support it. Supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and transportation cooperatives should cooperate with agricultural cooperatives. Counties and counties, townships and townships, cooperatives and cooperatives, mountainous areas and plains, grain-producing areas and cotton-producing areas, and urban and rural areas should support each other in terms of manpower, livestock, and tools. Personnel from government agencies, troops, enterprises, and schools in cities and towns should continue to help with summer planting after supporting the summer harvest. Supply and marketing departments should also do a good job in supplying materials for summer planting.

In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor and livestock, tool reform should also be vigorously promoted. Recently, many areas have rushed to produce a large number of summer planting agricultural tools, making transportation lighter, plowing deeper, harvesting faster, and irrigation semi-mechanized, which has greatly improved work efficiency. All localities should work hard in this regard.

During the summer planting period, although the wheat harvest is about to be completed, the distribution has not yet been completed. Living arrangements for farmers must be made according to the actual situation. Some grain or loans can be pre-distributed or subsidized to commune members who have insufficient rations and truly have difficulties in their lives, so that they can concentrate on summer planting.

    全力做好夏种
    芒种已过，全国主要产麦区正是夏收大忙的阶段，而紧张的夏种也随之而来。在做好夏收的同时，乘胜前进，及时地种好夏播作物，对于完成全年增产计划有着决定性的意义。
    全国夏播作物面积达六亿亩左右，约占全年农作物播种面积的四分之一。在这些夏播作物中，有一亿七千万亩左右的水稻，即全国水稻面积的三分之一左右，要在这时候插秧；有一亿二千万亩左右的夏甘薯和约占全国玉米面积三分之一的夏播玉米，将在麦收后栽插和播种；此外还有大豆和不少的小杂粮、杂豆和油料、烟草等经济作物，也都在此时播种。今年许多地方为了提高土地利用率和增加耕地产量，扩大了复种间作的面积，双季稻、麦茬稻、麦茬薯等面积扩大得更多。这些作物的栽插播种都需要较大的劳动量，并且要争取尽早完成。而这个时期又是麦收和大秋作物田间管理工作繁忙的季节。所有这些都说明，夏种是一项紧迫而艰巨的任务。
    今年各地兴修了大量的水利工程，为早播创造了有利条件。但在水利条件较差的地区，还是必需作好思想准备。在麦收之后如果天不下雨，应即进行抗旱播种，决不要存侥幸心理，等雨播种，以致延误了播种期。历年来各地经验证明，决定夏种作物收成丰歉的关键是争取时间，尽早播种。早种不仅可以保证作物有足够的生育期，有利于产量的提高，并且可以早腾茬口，争取小麦的适时播种或早耕秋耕。农谚早有“春争日、夏争时”的说法，必须下决心争时间，坚决作到随收割，随即播种。
    为了达到早种的目的，各地应该很好地总结推广群众中已有的好经验，改进与提高夏播作物耕作栽培技术。在作物生长期中坚决做到保苗、保穗、保粒。过去由于夏种时间紧，劳力、工具不足，一般种植粗糙，不施肥，不耕地。为了改变这种情况，必须大力提高夏播作物的耕作栽培技术，水稻要施足基肥，平整畦面，作到密植匀插；甘薯要做好深耕起畦，分层施肥，壮秧浅插；玉米要做到深耕保墒，施足底肥，早种增株。其他如谷子、大豆等也必须深耕耙平，施足底肥，并加强对地下害虫的防治，保证苗全苗旺。
    在夏种中要检查春种作物的生长情况。除抓紧及时中耕除草和田间管理外，要开展一次查苗补苗运动，突击消灭二、三类苗。夏种作物出苗后，也要立即抓紧时间全面检查，缺苗的赶快补种移栽，争取作到块块无断垅、垅垅不缺苗。
    今年各地积肥的数量比往年有所增多，但是有些地区已经把大部肥料施到春播作物和小麦的田间，夏种作物的底肥并不充足，与增产指标的要求相差较多。目前各地除了将积存的一部分肥料用于夏种基肥外，应该大力增积肥料，准备早施追肥。
    今年夏种一个重要的特点，是黄淮流域地带的麦茬稻、麦茬薯将有大量增加。这两项高产作物对于这些地区生产的跃进有重大关系，必须想尽一切办法，力争完成种植计划。在水稻方面，首先应该把秧苗管理好，检查一下秧苗数量是否符合本田需要，以便将来调剂秧苗。其次要把畦埂渠沟作好，土地平好，肥料施好，宁使地等秧，不要让秧等地。第三，要传授好插秧技术，普遍作到插秧稀密深浅适度，插得早，效率高。在甘薯方面：要加强采苗圃及春甘薯大田的管理，增施肥料，适时灌溉，以便供给更多的壮苗，满足扩种夏甘薯的需要。
    今年夏种任务大，要求高，时间紧，又必须做到早种，劳畜力不足成为突出的问题。因此必须及早作好劳畜力的安排，挖掘劳动潜力，做到男女老少齐出动。对于可以在夏种前做的农活要集中力量突击完成。对于劳动力的组织，应根据夏种工作中农活缓急，进行排队，根据工作需要和社员特长，分别组织夏种专业队，各负专责，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。最近不少地方农业社举办了农忙食堂和临时托儿所，对于提高劳动效率和解决妇女家庭牵扯，很有帮助。
    夏种中要组织共产主义大协作，动员一切力量来支援。供销社、手工业社、运输业社都要与农业社互相配合。县与县，乡与乡，社与社，山地与平原，粮区与棉区，城镇与农村，要在人力、畜力、工具方面相互支援。城镇中的机关、部队、企业、学校的人员，在支援夏收以后，应继续帮助夏种。供销部门还应该做好夏种的物资供应工作。
    为了解决劳畜力不足的矛盾，还要大力推行工具改革。不少地区最近突击赶制大批夏种农具，使运输更轻便，翻地更深，收打更快，灌溉也半机械化了，这就大大提高了工作效率。各地都应当在这方面努力。
    在夏种期间，虽然麦收将毕，但还未能作好分配，必须根据实际情况，作好农民生活安排，对于口粮不足和生活确实有困难的社员可以预分或补助一些粮食或贷款，使他们安心投入夏种。
