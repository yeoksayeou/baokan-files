    Brown sails,
    Covering the sky,
    Hundreds and thousands,
    Flying to the harbor.

    Harbor waves,
    Boundless and endless,
    Old Tie Mountain stones,
    Fully loaded on ships.

    Stones fill the sea,
    Expanding the harbor,
    Hundred-zhang deep harbor,
    Docking large ships.

    Large ships of ten thousand tons,
    Built by China itself,
    Shaking the world,
    People's hearts rejoicing.

    Catching up with England,
    Bold words shake the sky,
    Six hundred million people,
    Overturning seas and moving mountains.

    Sails fly with the wind,
    Momentum changes with people,
    Vast and great world,
    Sudden and dramatic changes.

    Ten thousand layers of ocean,
    Waves sing praises,
    Peaceful China,
    Limitless strength.

    Sea waves surging,
    Ships travel like arrows,
    Brown sails,
    Bravely advancing forward.

    褐色的帆
    师田手褐色的帆，遮掩着天，成百成千，飞向港湾。港湾巨浪，无边无沿，老铁山石，满船运搬。石填大海，扩展港湾，百丈深港，停泊大船。大船万吨，中国自建，震动寰宇，人心狂欢。直赶英国，豪语动天，六亿人民，倒海移山。帆随风飞，势因人转，浩浩大千，瞬息剧变。万重海洋，鼓浪胜赞，和平中国，力大无边。海浪滔天，船行如箭，褐色的帆，勇往直前。
