Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd. Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to all members of the Moscow City Workers' Soviet delegation headed by Chairman Bobrovnikov.

　　Peng Zhen spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said: The Beijing Municipal People's Committee delegation stayed in the Soviet Union for a period of time the year before last, just like being at home; this time, the comrades of the Moscow City Workers' Soviet delegation said that they also feel like they are at home in China. Although China and the Soviet Union are two countries, we are one family. China and the Soviet Union are one family, and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are one family. We are one family today, and we will always be one family.

　　Peng Zhen said: The Moscow City Workers' Soviet delegation brought the friendship of the people of Moscow and the people of the Soviet Union, and we also hope that the comrades of the delegation will bring the friendship of the people of Beijing and the people of China to the people of Moscow and the people of the Soviet Union. Peng Zhen said: The construction of Beijing has received a lot of help from the people of Moscow. Here, we express our heartfelt thanks to the Party, government and people of Moscow. Peng Zhen finally proposed a toast to the friendship between Beijing and Moscow, to the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, to the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the further dominance of the East Wind over the West Wind, and to the health of the leaders of the Soviet Party and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev.

　　Chairman Bobrovnikov then spoke, saying: Our delegation has been visiting your beautiful country for two weeks. We are returning to Moscow with deep impressions of the Chinese people. He said: The people of the Soviet Union and China are working hard to further develop the friendship between the two countries. This close friendship and unity will play a major role in completing the tasks facing our two countries. In this regard, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet-China Friendship Association have done a lot of work, and we wish these two associations greater contributions to further developing the friendship between our two countries.

　　Bobrovnikov said that the recently concluded Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was a meeting of great historical significance. It summarized the achievements already made by the Chinese people and put forward new tasks to the Chinese people. There is no doubt that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will successfully complete these tasks.
