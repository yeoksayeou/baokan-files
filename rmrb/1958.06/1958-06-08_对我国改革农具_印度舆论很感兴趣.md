Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th. News reports in Indian newspapers about the agricultural tool reform exhibition held in Beijing have aroused great interest here.

The "Times of India" recently published an editorial saying that India "must learn to manufacture new agricultural tools that are low in cost, save labor, and are more effective. This is precisely what China is doing."

In India, the most common tillage tool at present is a wooden plow fitted with a sharp steel blade.

    对我国改革农具
    印度舆论很感兴趣
    据新华社新德里7日电　印度报纸登载的关于在北京举行的农具改革展览会的消息引起这里很大的兴趣。
    “印度时报”最近发表社论说：印度“必须学习制造成本低、节省劳动力、效力比较大的新农具。这正是中国在做的工作”。
    在印度，目前最普通的耕地农具是用装有锐利的钢口刀的木犁。
