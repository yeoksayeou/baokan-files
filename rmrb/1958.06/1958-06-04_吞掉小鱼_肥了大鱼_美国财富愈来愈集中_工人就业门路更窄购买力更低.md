Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, New York (TASS dispatch): Hollander, Vice President of the United States Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, recently stated at Saranac Lake, New York, that "America's economic power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people."

Hollander said that some large American companies "swallowed up thousands of small companies" and "their decisions affect the quantity and distribution of American products, and affect workers' employment levels and purchasing power. When they set prices, they are actually imposing heavy taxes on consumers. In addition, they squeeze out their competitors, divide up markets, maintain high profits, and regulate production volume."

Hollander said: "Shareholders who now own most of the stock only control 5% of the large companies, while a small group representing minority shareholder groups controls 95% of the large companies." "Corporate property is so concentrated that 50% of America's processing industry is directly controlled by one hundred and fifty companies. In the United States, nearly two-thirds of the means of production (excluding agriculture) belong to less than five hundred companies, while the total number of companies in the processing industry is three hundred and twenty-five thousand."

Hollander also said that "Currently, 0.5% of companies in the processing industry obtain 57% of sales revenue, while all the remaining companies combined can only obtain 43% of the revenue... 60% of the labor force in the processing and mining industries work for America's five hundred largest industrial companies."

    吞掉小鱼  肥了大鱼
    美国财富愈来愈集中
    工人就业门路更窄购买力更低
    新华社3日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：美国混合成衣工人工会副主席霍兰德尔最近在纽约州萨拉纳克湖发表演说时说，“美国的经济实力日益集中在少数人的手中”。
    霍兰德尔说：美国一些大公司“吞掉了成千上万的小公司”“它们的决定影响着美国产品的数量和分配，影响着工人的就业水平和购买力。它们在确定价格的时候，实际上对消费者课以重税。此外，它们把自己的竞争者排挤掉，划分市场，保持高额利润和规定生产量”。
    霍兰德尔说：“美国现在拥有大部分股票的股东只控制5％的大公司，而代表少数股东集团的一小撮人却控制了95％的大公司”。“公司财产是那样集中，以致美国的加工工业50％直接被一百五十家公司控制。在美国将近三分之二的生产资料（农业除外）属于不到五百家公司，而加工工业的公司总数是三十二万五千家。”
    霍兰德尔还说，“现在加工工业中0.5％的公司获取57％的销售收入，而所有其余的公司总共只能得到43％的收入……加工工业和采矿工业中60％的劳动力为美国五百家最大的工业公司做工。”
