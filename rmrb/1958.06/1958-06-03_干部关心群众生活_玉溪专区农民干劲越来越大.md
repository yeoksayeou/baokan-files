Cadres Care for the People's Livelihood
　　Farmers in Yuxi Prefecture are Becoming More Enthusiastic

　　(Our report) This newspaper reports that since the Great Leap Forward, Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan Province has been concerned about the people's livelihood, which has made the people's revolutionary enthusiasm grow stronger.

　　Since the large-scale water conservancy construction movement began last winter, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has required all construction sites to ensure that the laborers are well-fed and have enough rest. In general, farmers in rural Yunnan only eat two meals a day. The Yuxi Prefectural Committee has required all construction sites to find ways to switch to three meals a day. Agricultural cooperatives and commercial departments sent large quantities of radishes, cabbage, and "nian zhazha" (wild sweet potatoes) to the construction sites. They also mobilized the construction sites to raise pigs and grow vegetables themselves. When the weather was cold, some construction sites boiled water for the laborers to wash their feet at night and prepared ginger soup. These practices were welcomed by the laborers. He Yixing, a laborer at the Dazhai River Reservoir in Jiangchuan County, said: "The Communist Party really cares about us. I must push half a cubic meter more of earth every day." The progress of the entire project has also increased from the original 1.1 cubic meters per person per day to 1.4 cubic meters. Due to the high enthusiasm of the laborers, some construction sites often worked for fourteen or even sixteen hours a day. The Yuxi Prefectural Committee then emphasized the need to regulate the pace of production, ensuring eight hours of rest each day. Later, all construction sites generally controlled the working hours to about ten hours.

　　Digging fields is the most strenuous farm work in the local area. When digging fields, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee emphasized that farmers must be able to eat meat. Commercial departments put forward the slogan of "changing the store into a peddler's pole, and using the field ridge as a counter," delivering farm tools to the fields and meat to the homes. They worked alongside the farmers during production, and sold goods and carried out propaganda during rest, achieving "three roles in one" (production worker, propagandist, and salesperson). In the past, farmers rarely went to the market during busy farming seasons, and daily necessities such as salt often became a problem. This year, they were all delivered to their doorsteps. Because the people were well taken care of in their daily lives, the physical strength of the commune members was maintained, which further stimulated their revolutionary enthusiasm. They put forward the slogan of "The sky may be dry, but our will is not; heroes fight the drought." (Zhang Jiechun)

　　干部关心群众生活
    玉溪专区农民干劲越来越大
    本报讯  云南省玉溪专区在大跃进中关心群众的生活，使群众的革命干劲越来越大。
    去冬以来，大规模的兴修水利运动一开始，中共玉溪地委就要各工地必须让民工吃饱，休息好。云南农村一般每天只吃两顿，玉溪地委要求各工地一定想法改吃三顿。各农业社和商业部门把大批的萝卜、白菜、年渣渣（野生薯类）送上了工地。并发动各工地自己养猪、种菜。在天冷的时候，有些工地晚上给民工烧洗脚水，准备姜汤等。这些做法受到了民工的欢迎。江川县大寨河水库民工何一兴说：“共产党真是太关心我们了，我一定要每天多推半方土。”整个工程进度也由原来的每人每天一点一土方提高到一点四土方。由于民工热情的高涨，有些工地每天常干到十四小时甚至十六小时。玉溪地委又强调注意调剂生产节奏，每天要有八小时的休息，后来各工地一般都控制在十小时左右。
    挖田是当地最费力的农活，挖田时玉溪地委强调一定让农民吃到肉，商业部门提出了“改门市部为货郎担，田埂当柜台”的口号，送农具到田，送肉到家。生产时和农民一道生产，休息时售货、宣传，做到“三员一体”（生产员、宣传员、售货员。）过去在农忙的时候，农民很少赶街，盐巴之类的生活必需品也常发生问题，今年也都送上了门。由于生活上照顾的好，保养了社员们的体力，更激发了革命干劲，他们提出了“天干志不干，英雄战干旱”的口号。（章皆淳）
