Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 17th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated in the Diet today that his policy direction after reassuming the post of Prime Minister is to accelerate the implementation of his past reactionary policies.

In his policy address, Kishi Nobusuke made it clear that the new cabinet will continue to adhere to the basic spirit of the pro-American diplomatic policy consistently pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Kishi Nobusuke chanted the slogan of "peaceful and independent diplomacy" in his speech, but he did not put forward any specific content in this regard.

Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese relations that the Japanese people are concerned about, Kishi Nobusuke avoided mentioning the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement that he personally undermined, and the series of hostile acts that occurred under his connivance, such as the incident in which Japanese thugs insulted the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki, and other acts that undermined Sino-Japanese relations. He merely repeated the cliché of "conducting trade and cultural exchanges in the absence of diplomatic relations," indicating that he would not change his policy of hostility towards China.

Kishi Nobusuke admitted that the economic crisis in the capitalist world has a great impact on Japan, and the international environment in which the Japanese economy is situated is not optimistic.

Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki immediately raised questions in the House of Representatives that day targeting Kishi Nobusuke's policy address.

In response to questioning, Kishi Nobusuke repeated the opinions he had expressed in his policy address. He openly stated that he has always advocated the adoption of a single-seat constituency system, and insisted on promoting militaristic education and implementing the "performance rating" system. Regarding the issue of Japan not implementing nuclear armament, he prevaricated by saying that he would raise it with the United States at an "appropriate time."

### 岸信介在日本国会表示  要加紧执行反动政策

    岸信介在日本国会表示
    要加紧执行反动政策
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在国会发表演说，表示他重任日本首相以后的施政方针是加紧执行他过去的反动政策。
    岸信介在他的施政演说中表明，新内阁今后仍然要坚持岸信介内阁一向执行的屈从美国的外交方针的基本精神。岸信介在演说中高唱“和平自主外交”，但是，他在这方面没有提出任何具体内容。
    对于日本人民所关心的日中关系问题，岸信介避而不谈由他一手破坏了的第四次日中贸易协定，在他纵容下发生的日本暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗的事件等一连串破坏中日关系的敌对行为。他仅仅重复了所谓“在目前没有恢复邦交的情况下进行贸易和文化交流”的滥调，表示他不改变敌视中国的政策。
    岸信介承认资本主义世界的经济危机对日本有很大影响，日本经济所处的国际环境不容乐观。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎当天在众议院立即针对岸信介的施政演说提出质询。
    岸信介在答复质询时重复了他在施政演说中的那些意见。他公开表示，他一向主张采用小选举区制度，并且坚持要推行军国主义教育和执行“勤务评定”制度。关于日本不实行核武装的问题，他搪塞地说，他要到“适当时期”再向美国提出。
