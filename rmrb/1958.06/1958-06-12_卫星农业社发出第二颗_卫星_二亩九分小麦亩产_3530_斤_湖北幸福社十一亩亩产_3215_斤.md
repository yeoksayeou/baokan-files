(Reported by our newspaper from Zhengzhou on the 11th) After the news of the Second Production Team of the Satellite Agricultural Cooperative in Suiping County, Henan Province, achieving an average yield of 2,105 jin per mu on five mu of wheat (reported on the front page of this newspaper on June 8th), the wheat from this cooperative, after continued threshing, showed that on the 10th, the First Team's Second Squad had 2.9 mu of land with a total output of 10,238 jin and 6 liang, averaging 3,530 jin, 7 liang and 5 qian per mu. This is 1,425 jin more per mu than the highest yield of the Second Team, and more than three times the yield of 750 jin per mu from the same land last year. This miracle of high yield was cultivated by six comrades in the wheat high-yield experimental field: Chen Shijun, the squad leader of the Second Squad, Liang Youren, the deputy squad leader, Cao Yu'e, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, Chen Gen, the technician, and Chen Hongyun, the storekeeper.

The wheat on this 2.9 mu of land grew particularly well: the ears were large and long, the grains were full, dense, and uniform, averaging more than 1.2 million plants per mu. Before the wheat harvest, many people and agricultural technicians from all over the county came to visit and evaluate it. On the 10th, when this 2.9 mu of wheat was threshed, Chen Bingyin, a member of the Suiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Industry Department, Yin Zongwu, the head of the Satellite Township, Zhong Qingde, the head of the Satellite Cooperative, and the cadres of this brigade supervised the threshing, winnowing, and weighing at the threshing ground. In addition, there were dozens of cooperative members. After repeated calculations of the output and several measurements of the land, the fact of the high yield is completely reliable.

The main experiences of this 2.9 mu of land in achieving a high-yield miracle are: First, a large amount of fertilizer was applied in stages, a total of ten times from planting to harvest. Three base fertilizers were applied before sowing: the first time 30,000 jin, the second time 37,500 jin, and the third time 10 dan of human manure. After sowing, 70 dan of farmyard manure and human manure were applied per mu, and then 42 carts of miscellaneous fertilizer and 35 jin of chemical fertilizer were applied twice in stages. Before and after the wheat jointing stage, in order to prevent the wheat from lodging, two applications of wood ash were continuously applied, 2,000 jin each time, so that the wheat grew more than five feet tall and no plants lodged. Second, improved varieties were popularized, the amount of seeds sown was increased, and uniform and dense planting was implemented. An average of 30 jin of Bima No. 1 improved seeds was sown per mu, which is double the previous amount. All seeds were treated with wettable 666 powder, and all adopted the five-inch square grid dense planting method. Third, water was irrigated four times in stages. The irrigation method was small-ditch irrigation. Before sowing, a drought-resistant base moisture was irrigated, and after sowing, water was irrigated three times. Fourth, various natural disasters were overcome in a timely manner. In previous years, wheat midges were very serious in this area. This year, when the wheat midges were about to breed, pesticides were sprayed three times in succession, eliminating the harm of wheat midges to the wheat. When the wheat encountered cold frost, smoke was also used to prevent frost twice in a timely manner.

The good news of this high-yield harvest spread, and the people of the whole province were jubilant. Now, many areas are organizing cadres and the masses to visit the Satellite Cooperative to learn from this advanced experience.

(Reported by our newspaper from Wuhan on the 11th) The Second Production Team of the Happiness Cooperative in Cuiying Township, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, had 29 mu of wheat, which, after detailed acceptance inspection, yielded 2,173 jin and 7 liang per mu, of which 11 mu reached a yield of 3,215 jin per mu. In addition to the special acceptance inspection team organized by the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee and the Guanghua County Committee, researchers from the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, technical cadres from the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Department, and many journalists participated in this acceptance inspection. In addition to personally participating in threshing and weighing, they also measured the land to verify the area.

According to calculations, the particularly high-yielding 11 mu had more than one million ears per mu, and the wheat stalks were mostly about 150 centimeters high; the ears were generally around 10 centimeters long, with about 35 grains per ear, some as long as 16 to 17 centimeters, with more than 100 grains per ear. Under normal circumstances, about 15,000 to 17,000 wheat grains weigh one jin, but here generally only 11,000 grains weigh one jin, and some wheat ears even reach one jin with only 8,000 grains.

This land is on an island newly formed by alluvial deposits in the Han River. From 1953, the mud layer accumulated year by year, reaching a depth of more than ten feet. Last year, wheat was planted five days before the Cold Dew. The seeds used were "Nanda 2419." Its previous crop was sorghum. According to the initial summary of this acceptance inspection, the main experiences in obtaining high wheat yields on this land are: (1) Uniform and dense planting, with an average sowing amount of 32 jin per mu. All seeds were selected with mud water and mixed with Ceresan, and sown very evenly, with a land utilization rate of nearly 100%. (2) Deep plowing. In addition to the loose and fertile alluvial mud layer, the land was plowed three times before winter sowing last year, with a depth of about six inches. The wheat roots grew particularly deep, with many roots reaching seven inches. Some roots were more than five feet long. (3) Sufficient base fertilizer. In addition to plowing about 2,000 jin of green artemisia as green manure per mu before winter sowing last year, no other fertilizer was applied. This was mainly due to the rich mud layer accumulated year by year, which also met the requirements of stratified fertilization. Due to the deep plowing and even sowing, and the sufficient base fertilizer, although planted very densely, there was no rust root and basically no lodging.

The farmers of the Happiness Cooperative believe that although this land has achieved the highest wheat yield, the land is not finely cultivated enough and the plowing is not deep enough. There is still considerable potential for increased production. They plan to create a record of 4,000 jin of wheat per mu on this land next year. (Attached pictures)

    卫星农业社发出第二颗“卫星”
    二亩九分小麦亩产3530斤
    湖北幸福社十一亩亩产3215斤
    本报郑州11日电　河南省遂平县卫星农业社第二生产大队五亩小麦平均亩产二千一百零五斤的消息传开以后（这个消息登在本报6月8日第一版），这个社的小麦经过继续打场脱粒，10日第一大队二分队又有二亩九分地总产量达到一万零二百三十八斤六两，平均每亩亩产三千五百三十斤七两五钱，比二大队的最高产量每亩多一千四百二十五斤，超过这块地去年每亩亩产七百五十斤的三倍多。这个丰产奇迹，是二分队队长陈世俊、副队长梁友仁、团支委曹玉娥、技术员陈根和保管员陈红运等六个同志在小麦丰产试验田里培育出来的。
    这块二亩九分地的小麦长的特别好：穗大且长，籽粒饱满，稠密均匀，每亩平均有一百二十多万株。在麦收前，全县各地许多群众和农业技术员都来此作了参观评比。10日，这二亩九分地的小麦脱粒时，在打麦场上监督打场、扬场和过秤的有中共遂平县县委委员、农工部副部长陈丙寅，卫星乡乡长银宗武，卫星社社长锺清德和这个大队的干部。另外，还有好几十个社员。脱粒后产量经过多次核算，土地进行数次丈量，丰产的事实完全可靠。
    这块二亩九分地获得高额丰产奇迹的主要经验是：第一，肥料多，分期施，从种到收一共施了十次肥。播种前施三次底肥，第一次施三万斤，第二次三万七千五百斤，第三次施了十担人粪尿，播种后，每亩又追施厩肥、人粪尿七十担，以后又分期上两次杂肥四十二车、两次化肥共三十五斤。在麦子拔节前后，为了防止小麦倒伏，连续上两次草木灰，每次是二千斤，这样使麦子生长五尺多高，没有一株发生倒伏现象。第二，普及良种，加大播种量，实行匀播密植。每亩平均下碧蚂一号良种三十斤，比过去增加一倍，全部种籽都经过可湿性六六六粉拌种，并且还全部采用了五寸见方方格密植播种法。第三，分期浇水四次。浇水方法是采用小水畦浇，播种以前，浇了一次抗旱底墒水，播种以后，又浇了三次水。第四，及时地战胜了各种自然灾害。往年这个地方吸浆虫非常严重，今年吸浆虫快要繁殖的时候，先后喷射了三次药剂，免除了吸浆虫对麦子的危害。当小麦遇到冷霜的时候，还及时熏烟防霜两次。
    这个高额丰收的喜讯传出后，全省人民都欢欣鼓舞。现在不少地区正组织干部、群众前往卫星社参观学习这一先进经验。
    本报武汉11日电　湖北省光化县崔营乡幸福社第二生产队有二十九亩小麦，经过详细验收，每亩产量达二千一百七十三斤七两，其中有十一亩达到亩产三千二百一十五斤。参加这次验收的，除襄阳地委、光化县委组织的专门验收工作组外，还有华中农业科学研究所的研究人员、湖北省农业部门的技术干部和不少的新闻记者。他们除了亲自参加打麦、过秤外，还对这块地进行了测量，查实了面积。
    据测算，特别高产的十一亩，每亩有穗一百万株以上，麦秸大都高达一百五十公分左右；穗长一般在十公分上下，每穗有三十五粒左右，有的长达十六到十七公分，每穗有一百多粒。就通常的情况，小麦大约要一万五千粒至一万七千粒才有一斤重，但这里一般只一万一千多粒就有一斤，有一部分麦穗甚至只有八千多粒即达一斤。
    这块地，在汉水中新冲积起来的一个洲上。从1953年起这个洲逐年淤积起来的泥层深达一丈多。去年提前在寒露前五天开始种小麦。用的种子是“南大二四一九”。它的前作物是高粱。据这次验收的初步总结，在这块地获得小麦高额丰产的主要经验是：（1）匀播密植，平均每亩下种量达三十二斤。全部种子都经泥水选过，并用赛力散药剂拌过，播的很均匀，土地利用率接近100％。（2）深耕。这块地除了淤积泥层松而且肥，去年冬播前又犁了三遍，深耕约六寸左右。麦根向下长得特别深，许多根长达七寸。有的根长达五尺多。（3）底肥足。这块地除了去年冬播前每亩翻耕约二千斤青蒿作绿肥外，未施其他肥料。主要也由于逐年淤积的泥层很肥，又合乎分层施肥的要求。由于耕的深播的匀，底肥又足，虽然种的很密，却没有锈根，基本上没有倒伏。
    幸福社的农民认为尽管这块地获得小麦的最高产量，但是这块土地整的还不够细，耕的也不够深。增产潜力还不少。他们计划明年在这块地上要创造亩产小麦四千斤的纪录。（附图片）
