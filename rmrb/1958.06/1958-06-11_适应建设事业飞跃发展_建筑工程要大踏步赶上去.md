To hold high the banner, strive for the upper reaches, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results—the correctness of this general line has been proven by China's practice over the past few years, and we also have a relatively deep understanding in our work.

In 1956, due to the opposition to right-leaning conservatism and the unleashing of the enthusiasm of the broad masses, it was a year of comprehensive great leap forward in national socialist construction. From the perspective of our ministry, it was also a year of great leap forward, the year with the most completed tasks, the fastest progress in various tasks, and the year when the construction teams generally gained experience in industrial construction. In that year, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers was very high, and they completed 56% more construction tasks than in 1955. As the construction of many industrial bases unfolded comprehensively, all construction units were tempered, and their technical and management levels improved rapidly. To adapt to the need for a large increase in tasks, we rapidly built a batch of processing plants, making the construction base initially scaled, and added a batch of machinery to strengthen technical equipment. We were able to over fulfill the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, and 1956 played a decisive role.

At the beginning of 1956, the tasks for 1957 that we learned of were expected to increase several times over, so we had to prepare and order a batch of machinery. However, due to the opposition to "reckless advance," the tasks were reduced compared to 1956. As a result, a large number of workers were idled, some machinery was idle, and some processing plants were "underfed." The "dismounted" projects themselves also had to be maintained, which caused all sorts of waste. More seriously, the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres in our ministry took the opportunity to raise its head, point fingers, and make indiscriminate criticisms, saying that too much had been done in 1956. Doubts and wavering also occurred regarding some important guidelines and policies.

The national great leap forward in 1958 changed the entire situation. Engineering tasks increased greatly, and the number of workers was insufficient, the machinery was not enough, and the processing plants were too few. Particularly in areas with weak construction forces, this was even more evident. Those who shouted "reckless advance" neither understood that the situation in 1957 was only a temporary phenomenon, nor did they understand the great significance of the great leap forward in 1956, and they could not imagine that there would be an even greater leap forward in 1958. Their way of observing problems was not to look forward and backward, but to grasp the temporary phenomenon and exaggerate it unilaterally.

Of course, it is not to say that our work has no shortcomings and errors. Due to our leadership's subjectivism, dogmatism, and bureaucratism, there are many shortcomings and errors. But even so, we cannot deny that past achievements are the main aspect.

In the past few months, the broad masses of construction workers, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and under the encouragement of the Party's general line, have been in high spirits and full of drive. A competition movement to learn from Nantong (Construction Company), catch up with Nantong, and surpass Nantong has been launched across the country. The construction and installation plan completed in the first quarter of this year was more and better than in any previous year, exceeding the same period last year by 35%; while by April, it exceeded the same period last year by 86%. In terms of installation engineering in the first quarter, it exceeded the original plan by 274%; in terms of mechanical construction, it exceeded the original plan by 144%. The architectural design plan from January to April also exceeded the same period last year by 200%; in April, it exceeded 334%. The Industrial Design Institute of our ministry proposed to reduce engineering costs by 30% and double the design speed. With efforts, this can be fully realized. Through more than two years of practice, two steps forward and one step back, we have experienced how great the significance of correctly implementing the Party's general line is for the development of China's socialist construction.

How can we further resolutely implement the Party's general line and adapt to the rapid development of national construction? I will only discuss the following main issues.

Decentralize Enterprises to Form a Construction Network with Large and Small Companies

Resolutely implement the central government's decision on decentralizing industrial enterprises, decentralize construction enterprises, and let local governments uniformly manage them to meet the needs of the new situation of the whole Party running industry, all levels running industry, and the whole people running industry. Decentralizing construction enterprises to the leadership of provinces and cities can greatly strengthen the political leadership of construction enterprises. At the same time, the decentralization of enterprises can also free us from complicated affairs, make our work more proactive, concentrate more energy on considering overall planning, grasp major issues, and research and introduce typical experiences, so as to help provinces and cities run enterprises well and do a good job in construction.

Our existing thirty-one construction companies, with a total of more than 200,000 employees, have been decided to be fully decentralized. Among them, twenty-seven companies can be decentralized soon; some need to be decentralized slightly later because of the special engineering tasks they undertake or because they are still organizing forces. Most of these companies are decentralized locally, and some need to be drawn out to support areas with relatively weak construction forces.

Construction material enterprises will also be largely decentralized. Of the twenty-two cement plants, it has been decided to decentralize seventeen. Our ministry will only retain five cement plants and four glass factories as "experimental fields" and to undertake the task of trial production of new products.

In the future, the establishment of construction companies should also adopt the principle of combining large, medium, and small companies. Provinces and cities should have several large companies to undertake the construction of industrial bases and key projects, and serve as technical backbones to help medium and small companies solve technical problems and train technical forces. When necessary, they can also be transferred to support other areas. Special districts (cities) should have some medium and small companies to undertake general industrial construction and civil construction tasks in their areas. If necessary and conditions permit, they can also be upgraded to large companies. The construction of small factories and rural residences run by counties, townships, and communes should be undertaken by local construction cooperatives and construction groups as much as possible. There are about 600,000 to 700,000 construction cooperatives across the country, which is not a small force. We should help them improve their technology and give full play to their role. By adopting these methods, we can form a construction network with large and small companies, with backbones and general, with concentration and decentralization, adapting to the situation of "blooming everywhere" in industrial construction.

The Technological Revolution in the Construction Industry Should Implement Both High, Medium, and Elementary Levels Simultaneously

Gradually implement technological revolution and improve the productivity of the construction industry. Industry and agriculture must carry out technological revolution, and the construction industry must also carry out technological revolution. As Comrade Shaoqi said in his report:

"In a large part of the transportation and construction industries, old-fashioned manual tools still dominate, and the vast number of workers have not yet been liberated from heavy physical labor." "Therefore, in terms of production technology, we must, as much as possible, adopt the latest technological achievements in the world to equip our major industrial sectors with modern equipment; and we must also extensively carry out mass movements to improve tools and innovate technologies, so that all manual labor that can and should be changed, except for a portion of manual labor that must be preserved, is gradually changed to semi-mechanized and mechanized labor, so that necessary manual labor and mechanical operation are appropriately combined."

The direction of the technological revolution in the construction industry should be to develop prefabricated reinforced concrete structures, implement mechanized construction, and gradually realize the industrialization of construction.

In architectural design, we must actively adopt the most advanced design theory of "limit state" and adopt high-performance structures. Vigorously promote prestressed reinforced concrete structures, and use lightweight and economical building materials to reduce the weight of the buildings themselves, so as to reduce project costs. In ordinary projects, especially small industrial construction projects and civil construction projects, we must make flexible decisions according to local specific conditions. As for small-scale construction projects below the county level, we should adapt to local conditions and make full use of local building materials.

In terms of construction, in addition to metal structures and wooden components that should be prefabricated in processing plants, a large number of standard reinforced concrete components should also be prefabricated in processing plants; large components that are inconvenient to transport and non-standard components should be prefabricated on site, and then assembled on site by machinery. The facts over the past few years have proven that the implementation of this construction method can fundamentally transform the construction industry, and can enable project construction to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. First of all, it greatly accelerates the construction speed, shortening the construction period by more than half. A large project like the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant can be completed in less than three years. If this construction method is not adopted, it is definitely impossible. It also has the same advantages in civil construction. For example, Beijing Fourth Company used this method to construct a four-story building, which took only eighteen days from the start of construction to completion. Shortening the construction period can greatly save wages and management fees, and the economic effect of a factory, especially a large factory, being put into production one or two years ahead of schedule is unimaginable. At the same time, this construction method can both ensure project quality and reduce project costs. In short, gradually implementing industrialized construction methods as the direction of the technological revolution in the construction industry should be affirmed, and the attitude must be active.

However, the technological revolution in the construction industry must be implemented differently and step by step according to the conditions of different regions and different project objects. High-level, medium-level, and elementary-level technological reforms should be carried out simultaneously, and mechanization, semi-mechanization, and manual labor should be combined. Depending on the situation, the level of mechanization should be gradually improved on different bases. In areas where projects are relatively concentrated, especially key projects, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures should be actively adopted and mechanized construction should be implemented. Mechanization must be given priority in the main links and heavy labor. In areas where projects are relatively dispersed, especially those medium and small projects, various structures, such as brick and stone structures, brick and wood structures, can be flexibly adopted, depending on local conditions and combining the various conditions of the locality. The speed of mechanization can also be appropriately slowed down. At present, some light machinery, simple equipment, and earth machinery can be used.

At present, although large companies undertaking key projects have certain technical equipment, most construction companies are still basically manual labor, and there is a lot of heavy labor. Therefore, relying on the masses and carrying out mass movements to improve tools and create indigenous machinery for technological innovation has universal and important significance. It is necessary for both large and small companies. Now, in many places, a upsurge of improving tools and manufacturing indigenous machinery has been formed. Shanghai Fifth Company alone has created 57 new tools and indigenous machinery, including a single-legged jib crane that can lift 5-ton components. Leadership should continue to be strengthened on this, and it should be promoted in a timely manner so that the technological innovation movement continues to develop.

We Must Develop the Building Materials Industry at High Speed

Building materials are the food for basic construction, and the demand is increasing. They must be developed at high speed to ensure the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

Cement is one of our industrial products to catch up with the UK, and it is also one of the materials in the tightest supply. The demand is increasing day by day, and its uses are becoming more and more widespread. Various construction projects require a variety of cement products to replace steel and wood. Judging from the development trend of cement production in various countries in the world, the ratio between it and the output of major industrial products such as iron, steel, and coal is constantly increasing. In 1957, the ratio of cement to iron in our country was 1 to 0.87, the ratio to steel was 1 to 0.63, and the ratio to coal was 1 to 18. According to the large needs of industrial construction and farmland water conservancy construction in our country in the future, and the increasingly severe shortage of steel and wood, the proportion of cement should be even larger. We believe that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the ratio of cement to iron should be 1 to 0.8, the ratio to steel should be 1 to 0.9, and the ratio to coal should be 1 to 10, which is more appropriate. In the UK, the cement production in 1956 was 12.9 million tons, and it is estimated that it may reach 17.5 million tons by 1962. It is estimated that in less than five years, our country's cement production can far exceed them.

Glass also needs to be produced in large quantities. In the past, the main market for glass was in cities. With the great leap forward in agricultural production, the market for glass in rural areas will become larger and larger. In agricultural production, it can be used to make greenhouses to cultivate seedlings in advance and increase the area of multiple cropping. On average, half a square meter of glass can be used to cultivate seedlings for one mu of land. Suqian County in Jiangsu Province bought 13,000 boxes of glass in the first quarter of this year because it adopted this method. With the improvement of rural living conditions, the demand for glass will continue to increase. Now, the average per capita use of glass in the Soviet Union and the United States is 0.67 square meters, while the average per capita use in our country is only 0.07 square meters, which is nearly ten times different. In order to meet the needs, we must catch up quickly.

Glass fiber is one of the "cutting edges" of scientific development in the world today. Glass fiber has more advantages than any other type of fiber. The finished products made of this fiber have many unique properties such as being fireproof, non-absorbent, soundproof, heat-insulating, high-temperature resistant, and corrosion-resistant. Actively developing this industry can provide favorable material conditions for our country to quickly catch up with the international technical level in several important industrial fields. Glass balls made of ordinary glass solution can be melted in special crucibles, drawn into glass filaments, and blown into glass wool. Glass filaments plus plastic can be pressed into fiberglass. The tensile force of glass filaments and their products is more than twice that of steel wire. Glass wool is warmer than wool and has greater elasticity than all other fibers. It is the best heat-insulating and heat-preserving material. Fiberglass is lighter than aluminum and harder than steel. It can be used to make parts for airplanes, ships, automobiles, and machinery. The cost of each ton of fiberglass is about the same as that of steel, but because it is lighter, one ton of fiberglass can replace three or four tons of steel. Raw materials for manufacturing glass fiber, such as quartz sand and dolomite, are inexhaustible and inexhaustible everywhere in our country. The investment required to build a glass fiber factory is not large, and the production cost is also low. We have basically mastered the production technology of glass fiber. The glass filaments recently successfully trial-produced by Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory have reached the international level. The quality of glass filaments produced by Nanjing Hardware Materials Factory has also fully met the requirements. At present, our country has not yet formally produced it. We should vigorously run this kind of factory to make a big leap from the blank point.

Vigorously developing the production of high-alumina glass tubes, asbestos cement pipes and other materials to replace steel pipes will greatly save steel and alleviate the tense supply of steel pipes. At present, the consumption of pipes is very large. According to the plans of five provinces, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Anhui, the construction of water supply and drainage pipelines and gas pipelines alone will require one million tons of steel pipes and cast iron pipes during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The high-alumina glass tubes preliminarily trial-produced by Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory can partially replace stainless steel pipes and non-ferrous metal pipes for use in chemical, petroleum, food, construction and other industries. Asbestos cement pipes can replace steel pipes used for water supply and drainage, gas pipelines, oil pipelines and other industrial pipelines. Not only are they more than half cheaper, but they also have the advantages of being light, corrosion-resistant, and rust-free. We plan that by 1962, the annual output of glass tubes will reach 300,000 tons, and asbestos cement pipes will reach 200,000 tons. These two types of pipes alone can replace more than one million tons of steel pipes. In addition, prestressed reinforced concrete should also be used extensively to make pipelines, sleepers, pit timber, etc. to save steel and wood.

Our country has many varieties of non-metallic minerals, such as mica, asbestos, crystal, and Iceland spar. The reserves are very rich, and the quality is also good. Not only is there domestic demand, but sales abroad are also very popular. Therefore, we should increase production as much as possible; in addition to some that can be mined by the state on a large scale, some can also be organized by the masses to mine extensively.

Bricks, tiles, lime, sand, and stone are used in the largest quantities in construction projects and should not be underestimated. Local authorities need to make unified arrangements and unified balance to avoid long-distance transportation and waste.

Although the task of building materials production is very large, as long as we implement all levels of industry, the whole people running industry, and resolutely implement the construction policy of combining large, medium and small enterprises, and focusing on medium and small enterprises, we will definitely be able to achieve and exceed the plan.

The production of other building materials should also implement the same policy, carry out overall planning, rely on provinces and cities, develop separately, adapt to local conditions, and vigorously run them.

Resolutely Break Unreasonable Rules and Regulations

In order to promote the development of productive forces, we must resolutely break unreasonable rules and regulations. Of the existing 1,905 kinds of rules and regulations, after preliminary inspection in the rectification, 13% need to be abolished and 37% need to be revised. Some rules and regulations, such as the contract work regulations and the general and sub-contract cooperation regulations, excessively emphasize mutual restraint, which has caused a lot of buck-passing in actual work. Some business procedures are stipulated to be too complicated, such as the design procedures. The design of large factories stipulates more than 50 review procedures, which greatly hinders the design speed. Some rules and regulations are stipulated too much, too detailed, and too rigid, such as the design budget quotas, which have nearly 10,000 items. The door and window quotas alone have 81 items. It takes a lot of manpower and time to prepare design budgets according to these quotas, but in fact it neither plays a role in controlling costs nor can it guide construction. The labor quotas for construction and installation projects have more than 32,000 items, divided into 45 volumes, which are very complicated to calculate. The types of work for construction and installation workers are also not conducive to the rational organization of labor due to the excessively detailed division. Some design specifications stipulate standards that are too high and safety factors that are too large, resulting in a lot of waste. All these unreasonable rules and regulations, in the final analysis, are due to the lack of in-depth investigation and research, being divorced from reality, the lack of political command and the concept of relying on the masses, and the excessive emphasis on self-top-down "management," attempting to simply rely on a complete set of rules and regulations to do things well. As a result, there are more and more rules and regulations, more and more detailed, and the more detailed they are, the more supplementary regulations are needed, so that they are lengthy, crisscrossed, and form a "chain reaction," affecting the whole situation with one move, and not daring to touch it easily. As a result: the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses have been restricted, the coordination and cooperation of all aspects have been affected, bureaucratism has been promoted, and the development of productive forces has been hindered.

For these unreasonable rules and regulations, we must have a great liberation of thought, summarize past experiences on the basis of mass debate, and carry out systematic reforms. After the decentralization of construction forces, provinces and cities can boldly modify them in light of the specific conditions of various places. For some that need to be unifiedly revised or abolished by the central government, we also hope that provinces and cities will put forward opinions, which will be jointly studied, revised, and formulated by the relevant departments of the central government. In short, we must make the rules and regulations conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses and conducive to promoting the development of productive forces.

In order to promote the development of productive forces, we must also do a good job in cooperation in all aspects. The key to doing a good job in cooperation lies in improving communist ideology and overcoming departmentalism. Originally, under the unified leadership of the Party, Party A, Party B, general contractors, and subcontractors are all for socialist construction. It should be said that it is possible to do a good job in coordination and cooperation. In the past, all units that emphasized politics and where politics played a leading role were able to proceed from the overall interests, understand and help each other, work together, overcome difficulties, improve relations, and the work went smoothly. However, there are also many units with serious departmentalism, haggling, and a lot of buck-passing, which has caused certain losses to the work. Last year, the improvement of the contracting method was well-intentioned, and the purpose was to improve the cooperation between Party A and Party B. However, after the principles were decided, the specific methods were slow to come down, and some regulations were not entirely appropriate. Grassroots units had some ideological concerns, which instead strained the relationship between the two parties. The leadership of the Ministry of Construction Engineering bears a great responsibility for the problems existing in cooperation. The main reason is that there is not enough emphasis on politics, too much emphasis on economics; not enough emphasis on active cooperation, too much emphasis on rules and regulations; not enough emphasis on the spirit of service, not enough consideration of the difficulties of the other party, and not enough consideration for the other party, starting from oneself, emphasizing "conditions" too much. In the future, with the decentralization of construction enterprises, under the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, on the basis of the greatly improved rectification and ideological awareness, and with appropriate reforms of unreasonable rules and regulations, acting on the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests, small accounts are subordinate to big accounts, and economics is subordinate to politics, cooperative relations will surely be improved.

In the past, the main shortcomings of our leadership's thinking and leadership style were: more pragmatic and less theoretical, entangled in daily affairs and unable to be liberated; not enough in-depth work in practice and among the masses, forming shallow and not deep, rough and not detailed; not enough respect for materialism, and not mastering dialectics well, the method of thinking was somewhat rigid, and not enough comprehensive and systematic research on problems. In the future, in order to adapt to the new situation, we must improve our work methods and work style. We must be determined to break the old habits, old methods, and old styles of the past, establish a starting point from the overall situation, consider major issues more, face the whole country, rely on provinces and cities, improve cooperative relations, and implement the spirit of service; be more theoretical and less pragmatic, grasp politics, grasp thinking, and grasp typical examples. Therefore, we must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and instructions, resolutely act in accordance with the sixty articles on work methods, do a good job in "experimental fields," and increase dialectical materialism so that we can do a good job and improve ourselves.

In the Work Report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "The development of social productive forces requires socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds; the victory of socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds promote the leap forward of social productive forces; this leap forward of productive forces continues to stimulate the improvement of socialist relations of production and the progress of people's thinking." The Ministry of Construction Engineering will, in accordance with Comrade Shaoqi's instructions, under the new situation of "blooming everywhere" in industrial construction, do construction work more, faster, better, and more economically.

    适应建设事业飞跃发展  建筑工程要大踏步赶上去
    建筑工程部部长  刘秀峰
    鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，它的正确性，已由我国几年来的实践所证明，在我们的工作中，也有比较深刻的体会。
    1956年，由于反对了右倾保守，发挥了广大群众的积极性，是全国社会主义建设全面大跃进的一年。从我们部来说，也是大跃进的一年，是完成任务最多、各项工作进展最快、建筑队伍普遍取得工业建筑经验的一年。这一年，广大职工的热情很高，劲头很足，完成了比1955年大56％的施工任务。由于许多工业基地的建设工程全面展开，所有施工单位都受到了锻炼，技术水平和管理水平提高很快。为了适应任务大量增加的需要，我们迅速地建设了一批加工厂，使建筑基地初具规模，并且增加了一批机械，加强了技术装备。我们所以能超额完成第一个五年计划的任务，1956年起了决定性的作用。
    1956年初，我们摸到的1957年的任务，是要成倍的增加，所以不得不进行准备，订购了一批机械。但是，由于反“冒进”，任务反而比1956年减少了，结果工人大量窝工，有些机械闲起来了，有些加工厂也“吃不饱”了，“下马”工程本身也要维护，这就造成了种种浪费。更加严重的是，我部有些干部的右倾保守思想乘机抬头，指手划脚，乱加批评，说1956年这也搞多了，那也搞大了。对于一些重要的方针政策，也发生了怀疑和动摇。
    1958年全国的大跃进，改变了整个的形势，工程任务大大增加，工人不多了，机械也不够了，加工厂也不多了，特别是建筑力量薄弱的地区，就更显得不足。那些喊叫“冒进”的人，既不了解1957年的情况只是一种暂时现象，又不了解1956年大跃进的巨大意义，更不能设想1958年会出现更大的跃进。他们观察问题，不是瞻前顾后，而是抓住暂时现象，片面夸大。
    当然，并不是说我们的工作没有缺点和错误，由于我们领导上的主观主义、教条主义和官僚主义，缺点和错误是很多的。但虽然如此，也不能否定过去的成绩是主要的。
    几个月来，建筑业的广大职工，在整风运动胜利的基础上，在党的总路线的鼓舞下，精神奋发，干劲十足。在全国范围内，展开了学南通（建筑公司）、赶南通、超南通的竞赛运动。今年第一季度完成的建筑安装计划，比过去任何一年都多都好，比去年同期超过35％；而到4月份则超过去年同期的86％。第一季度安装工程方面，超过原计划的274％；机械施工方面，超过原计划144％。1至4月份建筑设计计划也超过去年同期的200％；4月份超过了334％。我部工业设计院提出降低工程造价30％，设计速度提高一倍，经过努力这都是完全可以实现的。通过这两年多的实践，两进一退，使我们体验到，正确地贯彻执行党的总路线，对于我国社会主义建设事业的发展，具有多么伟大的意义。
    我们如何进一步坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，适应国家建设事业的飞跃发展呢？我只谈以下几个主要问题。
    企业下放，形成一个有大有小的建筑网
    坚决执行中央关于工业企业下放的决定，把建筑企业下放，由地方统一管理，适应全党办工业、各级办工业、全民办工业这一新形势的需要。建筑企业下放给省市领导，可以大大地加强建筑企业的政治领导。同时企业的下放，还可以使我们从繁杂的事务中解放出来，工作更加主动，更多地集中精力去考虑全面规划，抓些重大问题，多研究和介绍些典型经验，从而帮助省市办好企业，搞好建设。
    我们现有的三十一个建筑公司，共计二十余万职工，已决定全部下放。其中二十七个公司，最近就可下放完毕；有的因承担的工程任务有些特殊，有的还在组织力量，故需稍缓下放。所有这些公司，大部分是就地下放，部分的需要抽调出来，支援建筑力量比较薄弱的地区。
    建筑材料企业，也要大部下放。二十二个水泥厂，决定下放十七个。我部只保留五个水泥厂、四个玻璃厂，作为“试验田”和承担新产品的试制任务。
    今后建筑公司的设置，也应当采取大、中、小型公司相结合的方针。省市应有几个大型公司承担工业基地和重点工程的建设，并作为技术骨干，帮助中、小型公司解决技术问题，培养技术力量，必要时还可以调出支援其它地区。专区（市）应有一些中、小型公司，承担本地区一般工业建筑和民用建筑任务，如有必要和条件具备时，还可以升为大公司。县、乡、社所办的小型工厂和乡村住宅的建设，尽可能由当地的建筑合作社和建筑小组承担。全国建筑合作社约有六、七十万人，是一支不小的力量。应当帮助他们提高技术，充分发挥他们的作用。采取这些办法，就可以在全国范围内，形成一个有大有小，有骨干有一般，有集中有分散的建筑网，适应工业建设“遍地开花”的情况。
    建筑业的技术革命要贯彻高、中、初级同时并举
    逐步实行技术革命，提高建筑业的生产力。工农业都要进行技术革命，建筑业同样要进行技术革命。正如少奇同志在报告中所说：
  “在很大一部分交通运输业和建筑业中，旧时代的手工工具还占着统治的地位，广大的劳动者还没有从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。”“因此，在生产技术方面，既必须尽可能地采用世界上最新的技术成就，使我国的主要工业部门具有现代化的装备；又必须广泛地开展群众性的改良工具和革新技术的运动，除了一部分必须保存的手工劳动以外，使其他一切能够而且应当改变的手工劳动逐步地改变为半机械化和机械化的劳动，从而使必要的手工劳动和机械操作适当地结合起来。”
    建筑业技术革命的方向，应当是发展装配式钢筋混凝土结构，实行机械化施工，逐步实现建筑工业化。
    在建筑设计方面，必须积极地采用最先进的“极限状态”的设计理论，采用高效能的结构。大力推广预加应力钢筋混凝土结构，采用轻质的、经济的建筑材料，减轻建筑物本身的重量，以降低工程造价。在普通工程上，特别是小型工业建筑工程和民用建筑工程上，要根据当地的具体条件，灵活决定，至于县以下的小型建筑工程，更应因地制宜，充分利用地方建筑材料。
    在施工方面，除了金属结构、木制构件，应当在加工厂预制以外，钢筋混凝土大量的标准构件，也要在加工厂预制；不便运输的大型构件和非标准型构件，在现场预制，而后用机械把它在现场装配起来。几年来的事实证明，实行这种施工方法，能够从根本上对建筑业进行技术改造，能够使工程的建设，获得多、快、好、省的巨大效果。首先，它大大的加快了施工速度，使工期缩短一半以上。像富拉尔基重型机器厂那样大的工程，不到三年就可以建成，如果不采取这种施工方法，肯定是办不到的。在民用建筑上，也具有同样的优越性。如北京第四公司采取这种方法施工，一幢四层楼房，从开工到竣工，只用了十八天。工期的缩短，可以大大地节省工资和管理费用，而一个工厂，特别是大型工厂，提前一、两年投入生产，其经济效果之大，是可以想像的。同时，这种施工方法，既能保证工程质量，又能降低工程成本。总之，逐步实行工业化的施工方法，做为建筑业技术革命的方向，是应当肯定的，态度也必须是积极的。
    但是，建筑业的技术革命，必须根据不同地区的条件和不同的工程对象，有区别有步骤地加以贯彻，高级的、中级的、初级的技术改革同时并举，机械化、半机械化和手工劳动相结合，分别情况，在不同的基础上逐步提高机械化的水平。在工程比较集中的地区，特别是重点工程，应当积极地多采用装配式钢筋混凝土结构，实行机械化施工，在主要环节和笨重劳动，更必须尽先机械化。在工程比较分散的地区，特别是那些中小的工程，可以灵活采取各种结构，如砖石结构、砖木结构，因地制宜，结合当地的各种条件来决定，机械化的速度，也可以适当地放慢一些，目前可以采用一些轻型机械、简单设备和土机械。
    现在，虽然担负重点工程的大型公司具有一定的技术装备，但是绝大部分的建筑公司，基本上还是手工劳动，笨重劳动很多。因此，依靠群众，开展群众性的改良工具、创造土机械的技术革新运动，就具有普遍的重要意义。不论大、小公司都很必要。现在，许多地方，改良工具和制造土机械，已经形成了热潮。仅上海五公司就创造了新工具和土机械五十七种，其中独脚把杆起重机就能够吊装五吨的构件。对此，应当继续加强领导，及时组织推广，使技术革新运动不断发展。
    必须高速度地发展建筑材料工业
    建筑材料是基本建设的食粮，需要量越来越大，必须高速度地发展，才能保证工农业大跃进的需要。
    水泥，是我们赶英国的工业产品之一，也是目前供应最紧张的材料之一。需要量日益增大，用途也越来越广。各种建设工程都需要用多种水泥制品来代替钢材和木材。从世界各国水泥产量的发展趋势来看，它与铁、钢、煤等主要工业产品产量之间的比例，是不断增大的。我国在1957年水泥与铁的比例是一比零点八七，与钢的比例是一比零点六三，与煤的比例是一比十八。根据今后我国工业建设和农田水利建设的大量需要，钢材、木材更感缺乏的情况，水泥所占的比例应当更大一些。我们认为，在第二个五年计划期间，水泥与铁的比例，为一比零点八，与钢的比例为一比零点九，与煤的比例为一比十，是比较合适的。在英国，1956年的水泥产量是一千二百九十万吨，到1962年，估计可能达到一千七百五十万吨。估计不到五年，我国的水泥产量可以远远超过他们。
    玻璃也需要大量增产。过去玻璃的主要市场是城市，随着农业生产的大跃进，玻璃在农村的市场将越来越大。在农业生产上，可以用它来做暖室，提前育苗，增加复种面积。平均用半平方公尺的玻璃，就可以培育出种植一亩地的幼苗。江苏省宿迁县因采用了这个办法，今年第一季度就买了一万三千箱玻璃。由于农村居住条件的改善，玻璃的需要量也将不断增大。现在，苏联和美国平均每人使用玻璃都是零点六七平方公尺，我国平均每人只有零点零七平方公尺，相差将近十倍。为了满足需要，就必须迅速地赶上去。
    玻璃纤维是当代世界科学发展的“尖端”之一。玻璃纤维比其它任何种类的纤维都具有更多的优点。用这种纤维制造的成品，具有不怕烧、不吸水、能隔音、能隔热、耐高温、耐腐蚀等许多独特的性能。积极发展这种工业，就可以为我国若干重要工业领域迅速赶上国际技术水平提供有利的物质条件。把普通玻璃溶液制成的玻璃球放在特制的坩埚内溶化，可以抽成玻璃丝，吹成玻璃绵，玻璃丝加上塑料就可以压制成玻璃钢。玻璃丝及其制品的拉力，要比钢丝高出两倍以上。玻璃绵比羊毛还暖，比其他所有的纤维的弹性都大，是最好的隔热、保温材料。玻璃钢比铝还轻，比钢还硬，可以做飞机、轮船、汽车、机械等部件。每吨玻璃钢的成本和钢差不多，但是因为它轻，一吨玻璃钢可以顶三、四吨钢材用。制造玻璃纤维的石英砂、白云石等原料，在我国到处是用之不尽，取之不竭的。建设玻璃纤维工厂，所需的投资不大，生产成本也低。玻璃纤维的生产技术，我们基本上已经掌握起来。上海耀华玻璃厂最近试制成功的玻璃丝，已经达到国际水平。南京五金材料厂生产的玻璃丝，其质量也完全达到要求。目前我国还未正式生产，应当大力兴办这种工厂，从空白点上来一个大飞跃。
    大力发展高铝玻璃管、石绵水泥管等材料的生产，用以代替钢铁管，对于节约钢铁和缓和钢铁管材供应紧张的情况，都有很大的作用。目前管材的用量很大，根据山东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、安徽等五个省的规划，在第二个五年计划期间，仅上下水管道和煤气管道的建设，就需要钢管和铸铁管一百万吨。秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂初步试制成功的高铝玻璃管，可以部分的代替不锈钢管和有色金属管，用于化学、石油、食品、建筑等工业。石绵水泥管，可以代替上下水道、煤气管道、石油管道以及其他工业管道所用的钢铁管。不仅价钱便宜一半以上，而且具有体轻、抗腐蚀、不生锈等优点。我们计划，到1962年，玻璃管年产量达到三十万吨，石绵水泥管达到二十万吨，只这两种管材，就可以代替百多万吨的钢铁管材。此外，还应大量采用预加应力钢筋混凝土，制作管道、枕木、坑木等，以节省钢材和木材。
    我国非金属矿的品种很多，如云母、石绵、水晶、冰州石等，蕴藏量都很丰富，质量也好。不只国内需要，销售国外，也很受欢迎。因此，应当尽量增产；除了有一些可以由国家大宗开采外，有的还可以广泛地组织群众开采。
    砖、瓦、灰、砂、石，在建筑工程上用量最大，不可轻视，需要地方上进行统一安排，统一平衡，避免远地运输，造成浪费。
    建筑材料生产的任务虽然很大，只要实行各级办工业，全民办工业，坚决贯彻执行大中小型企业相结合，并以中小型为主的建设方针，肯定是可以达到和超过计划的。
    其他建筑材料的生产也要贯彻同样的方针，进行全面规划，依靠省市，分头发展，因地制宜，大力兴办。
    坚决打破不合理的规章制度
    为了促进生产力的发展，必须坚决打破不合理的规章制度。现有的一千九百零五种规章制度，在整风中经过初步检查，有13％需要废除，有37％需要修改。有些规章制度如包工条例、总分包协作规程等，过分强调了互相制约，在实际工作中，引起了不少扯皮。有些业务手续规定得过于繁杂，如设计程序，大厂的设计，规定了五十多道审查手续，大大妨碍了设计速度。有些规章制度规定得过多、过细、过死，如设计预算定额，共有近一万项，仅门窗定额就有八十一项。根据这些定额编制设计预算，要花费很多人力和时间，而实际上既不起控制造价的作用，又不能指导施工。建筑安装工程的劳动定额，就有三万二千多项，分为四十五册，计算起来非常复杂。建筑安装工人的工种，也由于划分过细，不利于合理地组织劳动。有些设计规范规定的标准过高，安全系数过大，造成了不少浪费。所有这些不合理的规章制度，归根到底，都是由于缺乏深入地调查研究，脱离实际，缺乏政治挂帅和依靠群众的观点，过分地强调自上而下地“管”，企图单纯依靠成套的规章制度把事情办好。因而，规章制度越来越多，越来越细，越细就越需要作补充规定，以致连篇累牍，纵横交错，形成“连锁反应”，牵一发而动全局，不敢轻易触动。其结果：束缚了广大群众的积极性、创造性，影响了各方面的协作配合，助长了官僚主义，阻碍了生产力的发展。
    对于这些不合理的规章制度，必须来个思想大解放，在群众辩论的基础上，总结过去的经验，进行有系统的改革。在建筑力量下放以后，各省市可以结合各地的具体情况，大胆地进行修改。有些需要中央统一修改或废除的，也希望各省市提出意见，由中央各有关部门共同研究修改、制定。总之，我们一定要使规章制度能够有利于发挥群众的积极性，能够促进生产力的发展。
    为了促进生产力的发展，还必须搞好各方面的协作。搞好协作的关键，在于提高共产主义思想，克服本位主义思想。本来，在党的统一领导下，甲方、乙方，总包、分包都是为了进行社会主义建设，应当说，是能够搞好协作配合的。过去，凡是强调了政治，政治起了统帅作用的单位，都能从整体利益出发，互相谅解，互相帮助，同心协力，克服困难，搞好了关系，工作也进行得很顺利。但是，也有不少单位，存在着严重的本位主义，斤斤计较，扯皮很多，使工作受到一定损失。去年改进承包方式，用意是好的，目的是为了搞好甲乙双方的协作。但是，原则决定后，具体办法迟迟拿不下去，有些规定也不尽恰当，基层单位在思想上有些顾虑，反而使双方的关系紧张起来。在协作方面存在的问题，建筑工程部的领导上负有很大的责任。主要是，强调政治不够，强调经济有余；强调主动协作不足，强调规章制度有余；强调服务精神不够，考虑对方的困难、为对方着想不够，从自己出发、强调“条件”有余。今后建筑企业下放，在省、市委的统一领导下，在整风和思想觉悟大大提高的基础上，并且把不合理的规章制度适当地加以改革，本着局部利益服从整体利益，小账服从大账，经济服从政治的原则办事，协作关系就一定可以搞好。
    过去，我们领导思想、领导作风上的主要缺点：务实多，务虚少，日常事务缠身，不得解放；工作深入实际，深入群众不够，形成浅而不深，粗而不细；对唯物论不够尊重，对辩证法也没有掌握好，思想方法有些生硬，全面系统地研究问题不够。今后，为了适应新的形势，必须改进我们的工作方法和工作作风。一定要下定决心，破过去那些老习惯、老办法、老作风，立从全局出发，多考虑重大问题；面向全国，依靠省市，改善协作关系，贯彻服务精神；多务虚，少务实，抓政治，抓思想，抓典型。因此，必须认真学习毛主席的著作和指示，坚决按照工作方法六十条办事，搞好“试验田”，增加辩证唯物主义思想，以便把工作搞好，也使自己有所进步。
    刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中曾指出：“社会生产力的发展要求社会主义革命，要求人们精神的解放；社会主义革命的胜利和人们精神的解放，又推动社会生产力的跃进；这种生产力的跃进，又继续刺激社会主义生产关系的改进和人们思想的前进。”建筑工程部将依据少奇同志的指示，在工业建设“遍地开花”的新形势下，把建筑工作搞得又多又快又好又省。
