　　Jiangsu Fully Launches Summer Harvest and Planting Campaign

　　(Our report) A massive summer harvest and planting campaign has been fully launched in Jiangsu Province. From the south of the Yangtze River to the north, from the coast of the Yellow Sea to the Xu-Huai Plain, a magnificent and busy scene has emerged. As of June 2nd, all of the province's more than 22.7 million mu of barley and naked barley had been harvested. Nearly ten million mu of wheat had been harvested, and more than three thousand mu of autumn crops had been sown.

　　According to reports from various locations, this year's summer crops, including the three wheats, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and green manure, have generally yielded bumper harvests. It is estimated that the total output of the three wheats in the province will reach 8.5 billion jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. This is an achievement resulting from the rectification movement, which enhanced the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses, boosted morale, and overcame various disasters.

　　Under the radiance of the general line for socialist construction, this year's summer harvest and planting campaign has seen a surge of socialist cooperation throughout the province's urban and rural areas. Many cities and towns have established headquarters to support the summer harvest and planting, organizing cadres, workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, shop assistants, teachers, students, and others to support the busy rural season. According to incomplete statistics, nearly two million urban residents across the province have participated in the summer harvest and planting campaign.

　　While urban residents throughout the province are fully supporting the busy rural season, socialist cooperation between counties, townships, communes, and between hilly, mountainous, and plain areas has also rapidly developed. Commune members are using the spirit of communism to mutually exchange and support each other in terms of labor, animal power, and production tools. This effectively alleviates the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power during the summer harvest and planting.

　　江苏全面展开夏收夏种运动
    本报讯　一个声势浩大的夏收夏种运动，已在江苏省全面展开。从江南到江北，从黄海之滨到徐淮平原，出现了一片气象万千的大忙景象。截至6月2日止，全省两千两百七十多万亩大麦、元麦已全部登场，已收割小麦近一千万亩，已播秋收作物三千多亩。
    江苏今年夏收作物据各地已经收割的情况，三麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆和绿肥，都普遍丰收。预计全省三麦总产量达到八十五亿斤，比去年增产三成以上。这是经过整风运动，提高广大干部群众社会主义积极性，鼓足干劲，战胜各种灾害所获得的成就。
    今年的夏收夏种运动，在社会主义建设总路线的光芒照耀下，全省城乡人民掀起了社会主义大协作的热潮。许多城镇都成立了支援夏收夏种的指挥部，组织干部、工人、解放军、店员、教师、学生等支援农村大忙。据不完全统计，全省已有近二百万城镇人民投入了夏收夏种运动。
    在全省城镇人民全力支援农村大忙的同时，县与县、乡与乡、社与社以及丘陵、山区、平原等地区之间的社会主义大协作也迅速展开，社员们用共产主义精神在劳力、畜力、生产工具等方面互通有无互相支援。这样，就有效地调剂了夏收夏种中劳力、畜力不足的困难。
