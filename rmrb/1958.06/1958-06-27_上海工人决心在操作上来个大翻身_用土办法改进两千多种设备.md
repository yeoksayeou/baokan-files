Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Yongkang): Shanghai workers, in the first half of this year, using simple and easy-to-implement indigenous methods, have already transformed more than two thousand five hundred pieces of production equipment into mechanized and automated operations, greatly changing the technological landscape of Shanghai's industry.

    In the first half of this year, Shanghai's industrial, construction, transportation, and other economic sectors, on the basis of the rectification campaign and the "double-anti" movement, launched a mass technological innovation movement. The workers and masses of hundreds of industries have put forward: Shanghai workers, who have turned over politically, ideologically, and economically, must also bring about a great leap forward in operations. On the one hand, workers are constantly revising their production leap forward targets, and on the other hand, they are bringing their collective wisdom into play, designing on their own, and if they do not have advanced technical data, they are painstakingly researching with indigenous methods.

    The method adopted by Shanghai workers to convert production equipment into mechanized automation is "mechanize whatever can be mechanized, make breakthroughs in individual areas, use mechanization to drive further mechanization, and make all branches flourish." Through mutual promotion, the degree of mechanization and automation in various industries has rapidly increased. In the daily hardware, pharmaceutical, food, and other industries, some factories used to have manual labor accounting for 70% to 80% of the entire production process, but now the opposite is true, with mechanical operations accounting for about 80% of all operations. The remaining work, such as packaging and printing, will soon be replaced by machines.

    Shanghai workers have a common characteristic in creating and improving machine equipment with indigenous methods: they pay great attention to the actual use effect and do not pursue flashy or exaggerated claims. They try to use waste materials as much as possible during testing, so they succeed quickly and put them into production quickly. When the old technicians of the Shanghai Bulb Factory, Yuan Genbao and others, were designing a set of automatic glass tube drawing machines, they visited the complete set of modern gas tube drawing machines at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory. After discussing it, they realized that if they were to use such a modern gas tube drawing machine in their factory now, they would have to tear down and rebuild the entire glass workshop, which would essentially be the same as building a new large factory. Seeing that this method was not feasible, Yuan Genbao drew his own sketches and used old refractory bricks and sheet metal from the factory to put together a tube drawing machine that used coal as fuel, increasing production more than twenty times compared to manual drawing.

    According to preliminary investigation and analysis by the industrial sector, there are two important reasons why Shanghai has improved equipment with indigenous methods so much and so quickly this year: one is that through the rectification campaign, the sense of ownership among workers has generally increased, so taking the initiative to find ways to change equipment has become a common practice. The other reason is that since this year, workers' spirit of daring to act and dare to do has been greatly promoted on the basis of great ideological emancipation. Recent surveys and statistics in many industries show that the mechanized and automated equipment improved by ordinary workers generally accounts for 80% to 90% of the improvement projects in various industries. Of the 137 important mechanization innovations in the transportation industry, 127 were created by workers, accounting for 92% of the total.

    At present, Shanghai's industrial sector is organizing the mutual exchange of experience between industries of the same type and industries of similar nature, so that indigenous method improvements are more perfect. Factories that have already achieved mechanical automatic operation are now moving towards a higher stage—linkage.

### 上海工人决心在操作上来个大翻身  用土办法改进两千多种设备

    上海工人决心在操作上来个大翻身
    用土办法改进两千多种设备
    据新华社上海26日电　新华社记者周永康报道：上海工人在今年上半年，采用简单易行的土办法，已经把两千五百多种生产设备改成了机械化自动化操作，使上海工业的技术面貌大为改观。
    今年上半年，上海工业、建筑业、交通运输业等经济部门在整风和双反运动的基础上，开展了一个群众性的技术革新运动。几百个行业的职工群众纷纷提出：在政治、思想、经济上翻了身的上海工人，在操作上也要来个大翻身。工人们一方面不断的修订生产跃进指标，一方面发挥集体智慧，自己动手设计，没有先进的技术资料，就用土办法苦钻苦研。
    上海的工人把生产设备改成机械化自动化，所采取的方法是“能化就化，各个突破，以化带化，全枝开花”。经过互相促进，各行各业机械化自动化的程度迅速上升。日用五金、制药、食品等行业中过去有些工厂手工劳动在全部生产过程中要占到70％到80％，现在刚好相反，机械操作占了全部操作的80％左右，剩下来的包装、打印等工作，不久也将被机器所代替。
    上海工人用土办法创造改进机器设备有一个共同的特点：他们非常讲究实际使用效果，不追求浮华虚夸。试验时尽量利用废旧材料，所以成功得快，投入生产也快。上海灯泡厂的老技工袁根宝等在设计一套自动拉玻璃管的机器时，曾经到北京电子管厂去参观过那里的全套现代化的煤气拉管机。他们回来一合计，如果在他们厂里现在就要用这样的现代化煤气拉管机，就要把现在的玻璃车间全部拆掉重造，实质上等于新建一个大工厂。袁根宝看到这个办法办不到，就自己画草图，用厂里的旧耐火砖、铁皮，拼凑成了一台用煤作燃料的拉管机，产量比用人工拉提高二十多倍。
    据工业部门初步调查分析，今年上海用土办法改进的设备既多且快，有两个重要原因：一个是通过整风，工人中间主人翁的思想普遍提高，因此主动的想办法改设备普遍形成一种风气。另一个原因，是今年以来，工人们在思想大解放的基础上，敢作敢为的精神大大发扬。在许多行业最近的调查统计中可以看出，普通工人所改进的机械化自动化设备一般都要占到各行业改进项目的80％—90％。交通运输业一百三十七项重要的机械化革新中，有一百二十七件是工人们创造的，占总数的92％。
    目前上海工业部门正在组织同行业之间和性质接近的行业之间相互交流经验，使土办法改进更趋完美。已经实现了机械自动操作的工厂，目前还在进一步走向更高的阶段——联动化。
