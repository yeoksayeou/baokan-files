Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 21st.  Soviet circles held a grand meeting in the Column Hall of the Moscow Trade Union Building on the evening of the 20th to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the creative activities of the great Chinese playwright Guan Hanqing. His play "The Injustice to Dou E" was also performed at the meeting.

This soiree was jointly sponsored by the Soviet Writers' Union, the Soviet Peace Committee, the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, and the Ministry of Culture. Chen Chu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and embassy staff also attended the soiree.

The famous Soviet sinologist, Doctor of Linguistics, Fedelin, delivered a report on Guan Hanqing's creative activities at the meeting. He said that Guan Hanqing is one of China's greatest playwrights, and the genius of this playwright, who lived three hundred years before Shakespeare, is fully comparable to the world's greatest dramatists. The realism and populism in Guan Hanqing's works have had a great influence on the style of Chinese drama art, and it has enriched Chinese stage art. Today, Guan Hanqing's artistic works are not only the property of the Chinese people, but have become the property of all progressive mankind.

Andreyev, Chairman of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, also gave a high evaluation of Guan Hanqing's creations. He said that Guan Hanqing's works can be placed alongside the great works of Dante, Rabelais, and Shakespeare. Guan Hanqing's writings have become part of the world's cultural treasury and the wealth of all progressive mankind.

Subsequently, Zhang Yingwu, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting.

The evening ended with wonderful song and dance performances from both China and the Soviet Union. The excerpt from "The Injustice to Dou E" performed by the Stanislavsky Drama Theatre was particularly well received by the audience.

On the 20th and 21st, meetings were also held in Kiev and Riga respectively to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Guan Hanqing's creative activities.
