    Nanjing Woodworking Factory Uses Wood to Make Machine Tools
    Achieves Semi-Mechanization in One Month
    (Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch) The woodworkers at the Nanjing Woodworking Factory boldly created various wooden machines to replace iron lathes, transforming manual operations into semi-mechanization within a month.
    This factory is a relatively large woodworking factory in Jiangsu Province. Last year, it completed 20,000 finished products, but this year it aims to complete seven times more than last year (160,000 pieces) without increasing the labor force. At the end of April, the factory's Party general branch called on all employees to use machines to replace manual operations as much as possible for everything that could be done by machine. The guiding principle was to liberate thinking, break superstitions, rely on our own efforts, and create machines from wood ourselves.
    The policy of self-making machines from wood initially caused doubts among the woodworkers. Veteran workers said: We have been woodworkers for half our lives and have never seen machines being used. Young workers said: Mechanization is easy; just buy a dozen lathes and install a few in each workshop. Why make them ourselves? Some also said: An egg cannot break a rock, wood cannot withstand iron; can making machines with wood work? All these doubts underestimated our own strength and excessively believed in iron machines.
    The first to respond to the call and take action was veteran worker Wang Chengyao from the Third Workshop. He painstakingly researched and successfully trial-produced a wooden planer for the first time, which increased efficiency thirty times and immediately received encouragement from the leadership. Then he trial-produced a four-spindle drilling machine. The most ingenious was the automatic molding planer he created, with more than 170 parts all made of wood. This fact vividly educated the woodworkers throughout the factory and encouraged their creative enthusiasm. Subsequently, workers in each workshop began to use their brains, and after a few days, various creations and improvements sprang up like fountains.

    南京木器厂用木料做成机床
    一个月实现半机械化
    本报南京讯  南京木器厂木工们大胆创造各种木制机器代替铁制车床，在一个月内就把手工操作改成半机械化。
    这个厂是江苏省较大的一个木器工厂，去年全年完成二万件成品，而今年却要在不增加劳动力的情况下，完成比去年大七倍（十六万件）的生产任务。工厂党总支在4月底就号召全厂职工把一切能够使用机器操作的都尽可能使用机器来代替手工操作。方针是解放思想，打破迷信，自力更生，自己用木料创造机器。
    用木料自制机器的方针，开始曾在木工中间发生过疑虑，老工人说：咱们干了半辈子木工，没有见使用机器的。青年工人说：要机械化很容易，只要买十几部车床来，一个车间安上几部就行了，何必自己造？也有人说：鸡蛋碰不过石头，木头抵不过铁头，用木头造机器能行吗？所有这些怀疑都是瞧不起自己的力量，过分迷信铁机器。
    首先响应号召行动起来的是三车间的老师傅汪称尧。他第一次刻苦钻研试制成功一架木制平刨床，效率就提高了三十倍，立即得到了领导上的鼓励。接着他又试制出一架四眼钻床。最巧妙的是他所创造的自动线脚刨，机器上一百七十多件零件全部用木料做成。这个事实，生动地教育了全厂木工，鼓动了他们的创造热情，接着各车间工人纷纷开动脑筋，几天之后，各种创造、改进像泉涌一样冒出来。
