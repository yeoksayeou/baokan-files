Henan People Sing Songs of Bumper Harvest

    Speaking of Henan, talking about Henan
    Henan's wheat has a great harvest
    A harvest of 20 billion (jin) in one season
    Exceeding last year by one and a third times
    Removing the label of low wheat yield
    The "wait and see" faction has nothing to say
    Victory belongs to the General Line
    48 million people smile brightly
          ——Zhengzhou

    Big carts loaded, shoulder poles carrying
    Want to compete with the Heavens in height
    Even if the East Sea is poured down
    Not a single grain of wheat will be washed away
          ——Minquan County

    Bees gathering flowers over the south wall,
    Dad goes to the commune to divide the new grain.
    Donkeys loaded, carts packed,
    Pens and storage full to the brim.
    My mother smiles so wide she can't close her mouth,
    Grandma claps her hands with joy.
    Grandpa hugs me and kisses my face,
    His beard pricks me and it hurts.
          ——Dengfeng County

    A year of bumper harvest produces new songs
    New songs one after another
    The more we sing new songs, the happier we are
    The happier we are, the more energy we have
    The more energy, the more songs
          ——Anyang County

    河南人民高唱丰收歌
    说河南道河南
    河南麦子大丰产
    一季收获二百亿（斤）
    超过去年一倍三
    摘掉小麦低产帽
    观潮派无可言
    胜利属于总路线
    四千八百万人民笑开颜
            ——郑州
    大车载，扁担挑
    要与天公来比高
    任你倒下东海水
    麦子一粒冲不跑
          ——民权县
    蜜蜂采花过南墙，
    爹去社里分新粮。
    毛驴驮，大车装，
    圈里囤里满当当。
    俺娘笑的合不住嘴，
    奶奶喜的拍巴掌。
    爷爷抱住我亲脸蛋，
    胡子扎得我疼的慌。
          ——登封县
    丰收之年产新歌
    新歌一个又一个
    越唱新歌越快乐
    心里越乐越有劲
    干劲越大歌越多
          ——安阳县
