Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: A chemical handicraft cooperative with only nine people and rudimentary equipment has recently extracted chemical raw materials such as potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride from brine produced from saltpeter, and has successfully trial-produced high-quality chemical fertilizers. Chemical tests have proven that the effectiveness of this locally produced chemical fertilizer is similar to that of modern industrially produced chemical fertilizers. Each pound can increase grain production by three pounds, equivalent to sixteen or seventeen times the fertilizer effect of livestock manure and human waste, while the cost is only a little over nine cents.

Recently, the Qingxu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the experience of this cooperative and decided to immediately establish twelve chemical fertilizer plants and one hundred and twenty small fertilizer compounding plants in townships and agricultural cooperatives with suitable conditions throughout the county. The Yuci District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened an on-site meeting to promote this method. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also issued a notice requiring all counties with saltpeter to trial-run such fertilizer plants.

This initiative was successfully trial-produced collectively by Zhang Dianwen and three other young members of the Qingxu County Chemical Handicraft Cooperative. Now, this chemical handicraft cooperative uses existing simple equipment - two iron pots, several large water tanks, and wooden buckets, etc. - to produce one ton of chemical fertilizer per day. They are preparing to expand, so that the daily output can reach five tons.

    小手工业社的大创造
    从硝土卤水里提炼化肥
    中共山西省委要求一切有硝土的县普遍试办
    据新华社太原19日电　一个只有九个人、设备又简陋的化学手工业社，最近从硝土生产的卤水中提炼出了氯化钾、氯化镁、氯化钙等化工原料，并且试制成功质量优良的化学肥料。经化验证明，这种土制化学肥料的效能和近代化生产的化学肥料类似。每斤可以增产粮食三斤，相当于牲畜肥、人肥肥效的十六、七倍，而成本只花九分多钱。
    最近，中共清徐县委总结了这个社的经验，决定立即在全县有条件的乡和农业社举办十二个生产这种化学肥料的化工厂和一百二十个小型化肥配制厂。中共榆次地委已召开现场会议，推广这种办法。中共山西省委也发出通知，要求一切有硝土的县试办这种化肥厂。
    这个创举，是清徐县化学手工业社青年社员张殿文等四人集体试制成功的。现在这个化学手工业社利用现有的简单设备——两口铁锅、几个大水缸和木桶等每日生产化学肥料一吨。他们正在准备扩建，使日产量达到五吨。
