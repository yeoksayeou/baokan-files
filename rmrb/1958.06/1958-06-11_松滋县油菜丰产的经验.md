The experience of Songzi County, Hubei Province in rapeseed production, based on the past few years, has the following characteristics: 1. Rapid increase in unit yield. The average yield per mu in the county was 108 jin in 1952, and it is expected to reach about 150 jin in 1958. Among them, the "Victory" rapeseed, which accounts for nearly half of the rapeseed area, can reach 270 jin. 2. Rapid expansion of area. The rapeseed area in the county was more than 44,000 mu in 1952, and it expanded to more than 79,000 mu in 1958, an increase of 78%. 3. Rapid promotion of "Victory" rapeseed. In 1955, more than 1,300 mu of "Victory" rapeseed were introduced, and in 1958 it developed to more than 33,000 mu, an increase of more than 15 times. 4. Large guaranteed harvest area. In recent years, the guaranteed harvest area of rapeseed has generally been between 90% and 100%, with only a few years being lower, but still above 85%.

The experience of Songzi County's bumper rapeseed harvest is multifaceted, the most fundamental being upholding the program of rectification, a great ideological revolution, and a great change in work style, which led to a great leap forward in production. Under the general program of rectification, they did the following work:

I. Clear Guidelines, Comprehensive Arrangements

Songzi County, based on the spirit of comprehensive development of production, resolutely implemented the policy of a comprehensive leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil. At the same time, the county party committee made unified plans and comprehensive arrangements for the planting ratio of various crops.

II. Leaders Divide Battle Lines, Top to Bottom One Whip

Leaders at all levels implement specialized division of labor, contracted responsibilities, and both the county and township party committees have a secretary specifically in charge of rapeseed production. Agricultural cooperatives have rapeseed management committees, and production teams have rapeseed professional groups. This division of battle lines and top-to-bottom leadership ensures the implementation of policies and production increase measures.

III. Vigorously Develop Experimental Plots

In the whole county, from the county party secretary to district, township, commune, and team cadres, all have rapeseed experimental plots. Among them, the experimental plots for "Victory" rapeseed alone account for 23% of the total area of "Victory" rapeseed, with an average of one mu of experimental plot for every 4.3 mu of "Victory" rapeseed. The rapeseed in these experimental plots grows well and generally reaches 300 jin, with some reaching 400 jin. Through these experimental plots, they first create examples in each production season and technical link, and then organize visits for promotion, which has greatly promoted the bumper harvest of rapeseed.

IV. Grasp Models, Grasp Competition, Grasp Key Links, Grasp Measures

1. Discover models, cultivate models, summarize models, promote models, and use models to solve ideological problems of the masses. In order to solve the ideological concerns of the masses about "Victory" rapeseed, such as "early planting, late harvesting, too much fertilizer, not cost-effective," the county found, calculated, and summarized models locally, and educated the masses with typical examples. After calculating income accounts and holding great debates, the conservative thinking of the masses was eliminated, and "Victory" rapeseed was rapidly expanded.

2. Learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, carrying out production competitions is an extremely important link to ensure a large-scale bumper harvest. On the basis of setting key points at each level and having banners for everything, the county established an evaluation and inspection system at the county, district, and township levels in order to achieve balance between crops, regions, communes, teams, blocks, and seedlings. Through the "township to township, team to team, block to block" evaluation and inspection, the "commune catches up with commune, team catches up with team, person catches up with person, field catches up with field" four-catch-up competition was promoted, basically eliminating backward fields and third-class seedlings, and effectively promoting the balanced development of production.

3. Grasp the season, grasp the key links, take the first step in each production season, and promptly promote production. The county has winter droughts every year, and the rapeseed sowing period is very inconsistent. Last year, there was an eighty-day winter drought, and many people lost confidence in timely sowing. The leadership, in this season, seized the sowing link, and used many examples early to clear the minds of the masses, implemented drought-resistant technologies, and ensured the timely and early sowing of rapeseed.

4. Grasp measures, grasp technology, and conscientiously promote advanced experience. The county not only has advanced indicators, but also has reliable measures to guarantee them, and these measures are grasped deeply and universally. The more prominent yield-increasing measures in the county are:

    Selecting good varieties and carefully selecting seeds. "Good seeds produce good seedlings." In recent years, "Victory" rapeseed has expanded rapidly, accounting for 41.7% of the rapeseed area in 1958. "Victory" rapeseed generally yields one to one and a half times more than local rapeseed, which is the primary condition for increasing rapeseed production.

    Deep plowing and fine harrowing, meticulous land preparation. After rapeseed grows, the main root goes deep into the soil, so deep plowing and fine harrowing, meticulous land preparation is very important. At the time of sowing last year, the county had changed the original habit of "plowing without three inches of soil" to deep plowing of four to five inches, and the original one plow and one harrow for coarse cultivation was changed to two plows and two harrows or three plows and three harrows. And on the basis of meticulous land preparation, drought-resistant and timely sowing was achieved.

    Implementing dense planting to ensure full seedlings. In the past, the masses had the habit of broadcasting seeds, saying "a handful of sesame ninety-nine, one mu of rapeseed eighty handfuls," but now they have changed to row sowing or hole sowing. In the past, rapeseed was not thinned, but now it is thinned twice, and seedlings are fixed once. Seedlings are also transplanted to fill gaps in conjunction with thinning and even seedling distribution, ensuring full seedlings. Generally, 18,000 to 25,000 plants are left per mu, and in some cases, more than 30,000 plants are left.

    Increasing fertilizer application and rational fertilization. In the past, fertilizer application was generally insufficient, and the timing was not mastered. This year, the method of "six applications and two supplements" (base fertilizer, seedling fertilizer, strong seedling fertilizer, heat-preserving fertilizer, stem fertilizer, and flower fertilizer; supplementing the lagging and supplementing the balance), eating less and more frequently, and applying fertilizer evenly was promoted. And for "Victory" rapeseed, based on its characteristic of being "rich in old age," the principle of "sufficient base fertilizer, even seedlings, and fierce stem fertilizer" was implemented. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu generally reached about 350 dan (manure), and the increase in rapeseed production was promoted due to sufficient and rational fertilization.

    Conscientiously do a good job in field management. In the past, the local masses had the habit of "three disregards" for rapeseed (disregard fertilizer application, disregard cultivation, disregard harvesting), but now they are processing rapeseed meticulously. Generally, the field management system of "management to the field, responsibility to the person, strict rewards and penalties" is implemented, and the field management work centered on "six preventions and one treatment" (prevention of waterlogging, prevention of drought, prevention of diseases and insect pests, prevention of frost, prevention of weeds, prevention of chickens and ducks, and treatment of pests) is comprehensively promoted.

A bumper rapeseed harvest in Songzi County this year is a foregone conclusion. The county party committee is determined to maintain the bumper harvest and is also determined to make another leap forward. The winter sowing plan for 1958 is to expand "Victory" rapeseed to 120,000 mu, with a yield requirement of 400 jin per mu. The county plans to reach an average rapeseed yield of 1,000 jin per mu by 1962. The great enthusiasm is inspiring.

    松滋县油菜丰产的经验
    从几年来的情况看，湖北省松滋县油菜生产上有几个特点：1、单位产量提高快。1952年全县平均单产一百零八斤，1958年可达一百五十斤左右，其中占油菜面积将近一半的胜利油菜可达二百七十斤。2、面积扩大快。1952年全县油菜面积四万四千多亩，1958年扩大到七万九千多亩，增加78％。3、胜利油菜推广快。1955年引种胜利油菜一千三百多亩，1958年即发展到三万三千多亩，扩大十五倍多。4、保收面积大。几年来，油菜保收面积一般都在90％—100％之间，仅有个别年份较低，但也在85％以上。
    松滋县油菜丰产的经验是多方面的，最根本的是举整风之纲，思想大革命，作风大转变，才取得了生产大跃进。在整风的总纲之下，他们做了如下工作：
    一、方针明确，全面安排
    松滋县根据全面发展生产的精神，坚决贯彻了粮、棉、油全面跃进的方针。同时，县委对各种作物的种植比例作了统一规划和全面安排。
    二、领导分战线，上下一条鞭
    各级领导实行专业分工，包干负责，县、乡党委均有一名书记专管油菜生产。农业社内有油菜管理委员会，生产队中有油菜专业组，由于这样领导分战线，上下一条鞭的领导，保证了政策与增产措施的贯彻执行。
    三、大搞试验田
    全县从县委书记直到区、乡、社、队干部都有油菜试验田，其中仅胜利油菜的试验田即占胜利油菜总面积的23％，平均每四点三亩胜利油菜即有一亩试验田，这些试验田的油菜生长良好，一般可达三百斤，有的可达四百斤。他们通过试验田，在每个生产季节与技术环节，先作出样子，再组织参观进行推广，对促进油菜丰产起了很大作用。
    四、抓典型、抓竞赛、抓环节、抓措施
    1、发现典型，培养典型，总结典型，推广典型，用典型解决群众思想问题。这个县为了解决群众对胜利油菜“种得早，收得迟，背肥多，不合算”等等思想顾虑，便通过就地找典型、算典型和总结典型，以典型事例教育群众。经过算收益账和大辩论打消了群众的保守思想，胜利油菜获得迅速扩大。
    2、学先进赶先进开展生产竞赛是保证大面积丰收极其重要的环节。这个县在层层设重点，样样有旗帜的基础上，为使作物之间，地区之间，社队之间，田块之间，禾苗之间达到平衡，因此县、区、乡各级建立了评比检查制度，通过“乡乡到，队队看，块块查”的评比检查，推动了“社赶社，队赶队，人赶人，田赶田”的四赶竞赛，基本上消灭了落后田、三类苗，有力地促进了生产的平衡发展。
    3、抓季节，抓环节，按每个生产季节先抓一步，及时地推动了生产。这个县每年都有冬旱，油菜播种期很不一致，去年又遇到八十天冬旱，不少人都丧失了及时播种的信心。领导上在此季节，抓住播种环节，及早用许多事例，打通了群众的思想，贯彻了抗旱技术，保证了油菜的及时早播。
    4、抓措施、抓技术、认真推广先进经验。该县不单有先进指标，而且有可靠的措施保证，并且措施抓得深透，抓得普遍，这个县较为突出的几项增产措施是：
    选用良种，精细选种。“好种出好苗”，几年来胜利油菜扩大很快，1958年已占油菜面积的41.7％。胜利油菜比本地油菜一般增产一倍至一倍半以上，这是油菜增产的首要条件。
    深耕细耙，精细整地。油菜成长后主根入土较深，所以深耕细耙，精细整地很重要。去年播种时，全县已将原来“犁无三寸土”的习惯改为深耕四至五寸，原来一犁一耙耕作不细，改变为二犁二耙或三犁三耙。并且在精细整地的基础上，做到了抗旱适时播种。
  实行密植、保证全苗。过去群众中有“一把芝麻九十九，一亩油菜八十手”的撒播习惯，现在都改为条播或穴播。过去油菜不实行间苗，现在实行两次间苗，一次定苗，并且结合间苗匀苗进行移苗补苗，保证了全苗，一般每亩留苗一万八千到二万五千株，多的达到三万株以上。
    增施肥料，合理施肥。过去一般施肥不足，又未能掌握火候，今年推行了“六施两补”少吃多餐，均匀施肥的办法（即施底肥、提苗肥、壮苗肥、保温肥、苔肥和花肥，补落后、补平衡），并且对胜利油菜，根据它的“老来富”的特点，又贯彻执行了“底肥足、苗期匀、苔期狠”的施肥原则，每亩施肥量一般达到三百五十担（栏粪）左右，由于施肥足，施肥合理，促进了油菜增产。
    认真做好田间管理。过去当地群众对油菜有三不管（即不管施肥、不管培育、不管收获）的习惯，现在对油菜都加工细作，一般均贯彻了“管理到田，责任到人，奖赔严明”的田间管理制度，全面推行了“六防一治”（即防渍、防旱、防病虫、防霜冻、防草荒、防鸡鸭及治虫）为中心的田间管理工作。
    松滋县今年油菜增产已成定局，县委决心保丰收，也决心再跃进，1958年冬播计划胜利油菜扩大到十二万亩，亩产要求达到四百斤，该县计划到1962年全县油菜平均产量每亩达到一千斤，干劲之大，鼓舞人心。
