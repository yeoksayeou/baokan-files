Grasping Summer Grain, Grasping Autumn Grain: One Bumper Harvest After Another
Guangxi Breaks the Idea of ​​Underestimating Late Rice, Striving for One Crop to Equal Two
Sichuan's Early Rice is Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest, Preparation for Late Rice Planting is Made Early

Nanning Electric News from this Newspaper: In the revolutionary spirit of continuously leaping forward by looking at the next step after finishing the current one, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has made material and ideological preparations for late rice production in terms of improved varieties, fertilizers, and close planting. This will play a huge role in changing the historical proportion of "early six, late four" (annual yield of double-cropping rice is 60% for early rice and 40% for late rice) and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice.

Striving for a bumper harvest of late rice is a major key to Guangxi's grain increase this year. Since last winter, the autonomous region has experienced continuous drought for six or seven months, and the early rice planting plan has been reduced by more than 2 million mu due to disasters, which has a certain impact on the total grain output for the year. Therefore, the autonomous region has decided to increase the late rice planting area this year from 11.3 million mu last year to 14.19 million mu, which is more than 1 million mu larger than early rice; and it is necessary to greatly increase the yield of late rice and change the harvest ratio of "early six, late four."

While leading the people of all ethnic groups to vigorously fight drought, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee put forward the new task of one crop equaling two crops and doubling the production of late rice; and began to gradually transfer more than 20 million catties of improved late rice varieties from Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guizhou and other provinces; various special districts also carried out communist large-scale collaboration and supported each other. Vigorously launching a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign is another important measure for the autonomous region to lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest of late rice. Now a high tide of summer fertilizer accumulation has formed throughout the region. Rongxian Special District, which started earlier, has accumulated more than 1.66 billion dan of various fertilizers from mid-May to early June, with an average of more than 300 dan per mu of late rice. Advancing the sowing and transplanting period of late rice and further promoting close planting is the third important measure to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice. One of the important reasons for the low yield of late rice is the late sowing, which shortens the growing period of late rice. Now, the region has completed 70% of the late rice sowing plan, generally 10 to 15 days earlier than in previous years. The planting density of late rice in various places is also generally required to exceed that of early rice, and the seedlings per mu have increased from 10,000 to 20,000 in the past to 30,000 to 40,000.

Innovating late rice production is a major change in customs in Guangxi, and also an arduous ideological struggle. In studying the general line, all localities have emphasized breaking the superstitions and old rules in late rice production, emancipating the mind, and completely changing the situation of "early six, late four."

News from this Newspaper: An unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice is coming soon, and Sichuan farmers are actively preparing for harvesting early rice and planting late rice ahead of schedule.

Sichuan Province planted 19 million mu of early rice this year, double that of last year. At present, in the main double-cropping rice producing areas along the Yangtze and Tuojiang Rivers, the early rice is generally full of grains and is turning from green to yellow; the early rice in other areas is also generally heading and flowering. Judging from the growth of early rice in various places, a bumper harvest is expected this year. It is expected that the early rice harvesting work will begin from south to north at the end of June, about half a month earlier than last year.

In order to make every effort to do a good job in rushing to harvest and plant in time, agricultural cooperatives in various places have made proper arrangements for various farm works in the cooperatives in advance, and do as much as possible before harvesting. Yibin Special District is currently making preparations in the following ten aspects: 1. In order to solve the contradiction of large workload and short time, various localities are reforming old threshing tools, plowing and harrowing tools, and transportation tools on a large scale. It is expected that by the time of harvest, every team will have a thresher, every commune will have a continuous harrow, and everyone will have a seedling transplanter or row pointer. Where conditions permit, vehicles will be used for transportation, and cableways or chutes will be erected to transport in sloping fields. 2. 1.7 million mu of early rice must be harvested and threshed in less than 20 days. Various places will vigorously build field drying yards or outdoor threshing floors. 3. In order to ensure harvesting even during continuous rain, stoves are being built everywhere now. 4. This year's late rice requires 30,000 to 50,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu. Various places are vigorously accumulating fertilizers needed for late rice and delivering them to the fields in advance. 5. Comprehensively check whether the tools for rushing to harvest and plant are fully prepared, and conduct technical training at all levels to teach the masses the methods of using various improved agricultural tools and the technical specifications for planting late rice. 6. Make labor allocation in advance, and make various preparations for a set of assembly line operations of harvesting, threshing, plowing, harrowing, and planting. Everyone's slogan is: Strive to achieve yellow on the first day, green on the second day; yellow in the morning, green in the evening. 7. Generally use shovels or iron shovels to pull seedlings to improve seedling pulling efficiency. 8. Promote planting in seedling beds and contract by bed, changing the past phenomenon of seedling teachers planting first and others planting later. 9. Use half of the early rice straw to make fertilizer by chopping it and putting it into the field, which requires preparing chaff cutters in advance to chop the straw and put it into the field. 10. Fully discuss the above measures with the masses so that everyone understands the ideas and the methods.

### 抓了夏粮抓秋粮　丰收一个接一个  广西打破轻视晚稻的思想，力争一造顶两造  四川早稻丰收在望，晚稻栽插工作提早准备

    抓了夏粮抓秋粮　丰收一个接一个
    广西打破轻视晚稻的思想，力争一造顶两造
    四川早稻丰收在望，晚稻栽插工作提早准备
    本报南宁电　本着上步看下步、插完早稻看晚稻这一不断跃进的革命精神，广西僮族自治区已从良种、肥料、密植等方面，为晚稻生产作好物资准备和思想准备。这对改变历史上“早六晚四”（双季稻一年产量早稻占60％晚稻占40％）收成比重，争取晚稻大丰收将起巨大作用。
    争取晚稻大丰收，是广西今年粮食增产中一个重大关键。去年冬季以来，自治区连续干旱六、七个月，早稻种植计划因灾缩减二百多万亩，这对全年粮食总产量有一定的影响。因此，全区今年晚稻种植面积决定由去年的一千一百三十万亩增加到一千四百十九万亩，比早稻扩大一百多万亩；并且要大大提高晚稻的产量，改变“早六晚四”的收成比例。
    中共广西僮族自治区党委在领导各族农民大力抗旱的同时，就提出一造顶两造、使晚稻生产翻一翻的新的任务；并着手从湖南、湖北、浙江、广东、贵州等省陆续调进两千多万斤晚稻良种；各专区也开展了共产主义大协作，相互支援。大搞夏季积肥运动，是自治区为晚稻大丰收打好基础的另一项重要措施。现在全区夏季积肥高潮已形成，动手较早的容县专区，从5月中旬到6月初已积得各种肥料十六亿六千多万担，平均每亩晚稻达三百多担。提早晚稻的播种和插秧期并进一步推行密植，是争取晚稻丰收的第三项重要措施。造成晚稻产量低的重要原因之一，就是播种晚，缩短了晚稻的生长期间。现在，全区晚稻播种计划已完成70％，一般比往年提早了十至十五天。晚稻插秧的密度，各地也普遍要求超过早稻，每亩禾苗由过去一万至两万株增加到三万至四万株。
    革新晚稻生产，在广西是一次大的移风易俗，也是一场艰巨的思想斗争。各地在学习总路线中，都强调打破晚稻生产中的迷信陈规，解放思想，彻底改变“早六晚四”的状况。
    本报讯　空前未有的早稻大丰收即将到来，四川农民积极提早作好收割早稻、栽插晚稻的准备工作。
    四川省今年栽种早稻一千九百万亩，比去年增加一倍。目前，双季稻主要产区长江沱江沿岸一带，早稻普遍散籽饱米，正由青转黄；其他地区的早稻，也普遍抽穗扬花。从各地早稻的生长情况看来，今年大丰收大有希望。预计6月底，早稻收割工作即将由南向北展开，约比去年提前半个月左右。
    为了尽一切努力及时作好抢收抢栽工作，各地农业社提早将社内各种农活进行妥善安排，把一切能提前做的，尽量在收割前作好。宜宾专区目前正从以下十个方面紧张进行准备工作。一、为解决工作量大、时间短的矛盾，各地正大量改革旧有的脱粒工具、犁耙工具和运输工具。预计到收割时，队队有打谷机，社社有连作耙，人人有栽秧套或指行器。凡有条件的地方都将用车子运输，有坡田的地方将架设架空索道或滑道来运输。二、一百七十万亩早稻要在不到二十天内收完打完，各地将大搞田间晒坝或野外打谷场。三、为了保证绵雨时也能收割，现在各地正赶打炕灶。四、今年的晚稻要求每亩施底肥三到五万斤，各地正大力积造晚稻所需的肥料，提前送到田边。五、全面检查抢收抢栽工具是否准备充足，层层进行技术训练，把各种改良农具的使用方法和栽插晚稻的技术规格教给群众的工作。六、事前作好劳力调配，作好边收、边打、边犁耙、边栽插的一套流水作业法的各种准备，大家的口号是：力求作到头天黄，二天青；早晨黄，晚上青。七、普遍用铲子或铁锹扯秧子，提高扯秧工效。八、推广栽厢厢秧，按厢包工，改变往年秧师先栽，旁人后栽的窝工现象。九、用一半的早稻谷草打丢草作肥料，这就要求事先准备好铡草器，把谷草铡碎丢到田里。十、把以上措施交群众充分辩论，作到人人思想通，办法会。
