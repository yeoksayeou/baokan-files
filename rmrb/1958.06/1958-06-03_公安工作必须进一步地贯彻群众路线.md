Public Security Work Must Further Implement the Mass Line
Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council and Minister of Public Security

Our country's socialist construction is in the midst of a comprehensive great leap forward. We firmly believe that under the guidance and encouragement of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," established by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the people throughout the country will surely be further enhanced, and will further promote the leaping development of China's industrial and agricultural production and cultural undertakings, thereby rapidly changing the backwardness of our economy and culture. The emergence of a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture is just around the corner. In this situation, better safeguarding the safety of the comprehensive great leap forward of socialist construction has become the glorious task facing the national public security work.

Putting public security work under the absolute leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, and implementing the line of boldly mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses in the work, is a unique creation of our Party in its long revolutionary practice.

Our country's public security work is carried out under the close leadership of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong, and Party committees at all levels. The line of public security work was created, developed and perfected by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding the dictatorship of the proletariat, combined with the situation of our country. Its fundamental characteristic is Party committee leadership and the mass line. The formation of this line has gone through a serious struggle with its opposite – vertical leadership, isolationism, and mysticism. Putting public security work under the absolute leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, and implementing the line of boldly mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses in the work, is a unique creation of our Party in its long revolutionary practice.

The national public security organs are resolute and loyal in implementing the Party's line. Ideologically, they are clear about obeying the leadership of the Party committee. The Central Committee and Party committees at all levels have clear provisions for the leadership of public security organs, not only in terms of principles and policies, but also in terms of leadership relationships and organizational forms. The actual leadership in work is also close. Therefore, in general, this aspect of the problem has been relatively well resolved. Of course, public security organs at all levels should continue to pay attention and never tolerate any thoughts or actions that deviate from the leadership of the Party committee.

Making the public security organs fully revolutionized and fully mass-based, and allowing the mass line to have a new development in all aspects of public security work, is greatly beneficial to the comprehensive great leap forward of public security work in safeguarding socialist construction.

What is the situation of implementing the mass line in public security work? Generally speaking, it is also good and sufficient, and in some aspects, it can even be said to be excellent. However, can it be said that the mass line is fully implemented in all aspects of public security work? Absolutely not. There are still shortcomings in some aspects of public security work where the mass line is not fully implemented. In some cases, there are even errors that violate the mass line and seriously deviate from the masses. The remnants of isolationism and mysticism, and the remnants of the privileged thinking of a few people, still exist. At the same time, the situation has developed, the consciousness of the masses has increased, and the mass line of public security work should continue to develop. If it is said that implementing the mass line is the decisive key to the victory of public security work in the past eight years, then further implementing the mass line, making the public security organs "fully revolutionized" and "fully mass-based," thoroughly overcoming the remnants of isolationism and mysticism, thoroughly eliminating the remnants of privileged thinking, and allowing the mass line to have a new development in all aspects of public security work, cannot but be of great significance for public security work to better safeguard the comprehensive great leap forward of socialist construction in the future.

What are the manifestations of the insufficient implementation of the mass line in public security work?

From the perspective of investigation and security work, there are shortcomings in the insufficient implementation of the mass line. Over the past eight years, investigative work has achieved results in the struggle against the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents, but there are still remnants of isolationism and mysticism, especially when viewed from the needs of work development, the problem is even more prominent. The main manifestations are only believing in oneself, not believing in the masses; only believing in the superiors, not believing in the subordinates; and being superstitious about certain technologies and not seeing the role of people. They have not truly understood that the combination of specialized organs and the broad masses can make our investigation and research work better, and can make our struggle with hidden enemies proceed more smoothly. In the minds of some investigators, they actually still hold some doubts about whether investigative work can follow the mass line. If this problem is not thoroughly resolved, investigative work will not be able to show its due strength in the struggle against the enemy.

In terms of various security work, the internal security work of factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools has achieved results in recent years. However, the shortcomings of insufficient implementation of the mass line also exist. In this regard, there was a period when some unrealistic secret investigative work was inappropriately emphasized; some security departments generally neglected the struggle against sabotage accidents and criminal offenders, showing insufficient concern for the realistic interests of production and the vital interests of the masses; and some security systems and confidentiality systems that were not suitable for the situation were established, with excessive restrictions, which were not conducive to production and increased the trouble for the masses. In this way, our security work could not but be separated from the masses to a certain extent. If these shortcomings are not thoroughly corrected, it will be impossible for various security work to better complete the security tasks on the economic and cultural fronts.

Here, we should also examine the relationship between public security personnel and the people.

The relationship between public security personnel and the people is basically good, but there are still problems. From the perspective of the people's police, only a portion of them truly have the spirit of serving the people, truly integrate with the masses, and are liked by the masses. The majority are basically good but have shortcomings, and are liked by the masses but have opinions. The most common shortcomings shown by these people are that when they work among the people, their attitude is not good, their speech is not kind, and they do not treat people with an equal spirit; due to their low political consciousness, or due to arrogance and privileged thinking, they do not regard their position as serving the people and being the people's servants. On the contrary, they often appear in the posture of "managing people," "educating people," and "ordering people." In this way, to some extent, they confuse the methods of handling "two types of contradictions," so that although they have done some things for the masses, they cannot but create a certain distance between them and the masses. There are also a few people who have been infected with the style of the Kuomintang police. Due to their bad style, they not only do not do good things for the masses, but also do bad things, such as using their power to watch free shows, not standing in line when buying things when they should, and even deliberately making things difficult for the masses and violating laws and regulations. Therefore, the masses do not like them very much, and even resent them. Some of these people have made serious mistakes, and a few are bad elements who have sneaked in or degenerated. The number of people in the latter case is of course very small, but the nature of the problem is serious. It should be pointed out that all the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, of course, are not only found in the people's police, but also in other public security personnel. Therefore, if arrogance and privileged thinking are not thoroughly overcome among public security personnel, and if the influence of the Kuomintang police style is not completely eliminated, it will not only hinder the unity of public security personnel with the people and hinder the correct handling of contradictions among the people, but also hinder the further implementation of the mass line in the work.

In addition, there are also shortcomings of not being strong in the mass viewpoint and insufficient implementation of the mass line to varying degrees in other professional work. As for the bureaucratic style, subjectivism, and sectarianism in ideology and work style; the official air, lifelessness, extravagance, arrogance, and delicacy; and the lack of an equal attitude towards subordinates and the people, according to the rectification examination, although the degrees are different, they exist at all levels; although there have been significant changes after the rectification, it is still necessary to continue to pay attention to improvement.

Many vivid facts that have emerged in the rectification movement show that the mass line in public security work not only has great room for development, but also has had new developments in many aspects.

Recently, due to the results of the rectification, many vivid facts have emerged, indicating that the mass line in public security work not only has great room for development, but also has had new developments in many aspects.

Where reactionary slogans are found, the masses there are organized to see them, the masses are educated with concrete facts, vigilance is raised, and everyone is mobilized to discuss and provide clues, and as a result, the case is quickly solved.

For example, in the past, many places did not have many methods for handling reactionary slogan cases, and few cases were solved. Where reactionary slogans were found, public security personnel would go to investigate the situation, then quietly erase the reactionary slogans, and then quietly look for suspicious elements. Although some investigations were also done among the masses, they still closed the door to solve the case. As a result, it was hard work with little effect. It was truly "carrying a stone mortar to perform a ritual dance, hard work without reward." Now, many places have adopted new methods: where reactionary slogans are found, the masses there are organized to see them, the masses are educated with concrete facts, vigilance is raised, everyone is mobilized to discuss and provide clues, and the combination of public security personnel and the masses is implemented, and the specialized work of the investigation department is combined with the identification of the masses. As a result, the case is quickly solved. The security organizations of the cultural and educational departments in Wuhan City adopted this mass line method and solved many reactionary slogan cases in one month from the end of February to the end of March this year. They not only solved the current cases in a timely manner, but also solved the accumulated cases of the past. In many places, due to the liberation of thought and the improvement of methods, the situation of this struggle has undergone new changes. Our cadres are no longer troubled by reactionary slogans, and have learned to use them to educate the masses, use them to discover hidden counter-revolutionaries, and have also gained experience in combining investigation work with the masses, killing three birds with one stone, and turning bad things into good things. In the great leap forward, many places have solved a large number of cases by implementing the mass line, and have also solved some difficult cases that could not be solved for a long time in the past, and have discovered some situations that were difficult for the investigation department to know. For example, a homicide case in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, was not solved for a long time. During this safety movement, the daughter of the victim made a painful public appeal, requesting the villagers to seek justice for her, which deeply moved everyone. An old woman who was present originally knew who the murderer was, but did not dare to speak for a long time. At this time, due to the improvement of her consciousness, she immediately stood up and said: "I will risk my old life and seek justice for you!" Then the truth came out. It can be seen that as long as the mass line is truly implemented in investigative work, its situation will be greatly changed.

Due to the adoption of mass mobilization and everyone's participation, fire protection work has been greatly strengthened and fires have been greatly reduced.

For example, in the great leap forward this year, due to the full mobilization of the masses, the masses came up with various good ways to prevent fires. In the coastal areas of Zhejiang, the masses proposed the methods of "clear the front of the stove, shallow the stove pit, fill the water tank, and clean the chimney," and formulated fire protection agreements and inspection systems, which greatly reduced the occurrence of fires. At the same time, the ash that was taken out also played a role in accumulating fertilizer. In the past, large fires occurred many times in the shantytowns of Wuhan City, causing great losses. This spring, according to the requirements put forward by the masses through blooming and contending and big-character posters, the method of mass mobilization and everyone's participation was adopted, and in a very short period of time, more than 450,000 stoves were repaired, and fire walls were built for more than 110,000 unsafe stoves. Other cities have also done this. From the recent situation, it has had a great effect. Such things could not be done in the past many years, but they were quickly done by mobilizing the masses.

The masses dare to criticize the police, and criticize by name publicly in the form of big-character posters. This has never happened before at home or abroad, and it is a great thing.

In terms of police-people relations, there have also been some new atmospheres recently. In the national rectification movement, the broad masses of people put forward many good criticisms and suggestions to the people's police through blooming and contending and big-character posters. The big-character posters posted in the streets of Beijing and the alleys of Shanghai have many opinions on the police of the police stations, and all the police have received a very profound education from them. From the big-character posters posted by the masses, it can be seen that the masses have broken down their worries about the police and regard the police as their own people. The masses dare to criticize the police, and criticize by name publicly in the form of big-character posters. This has never happened before at home or abroad, and it is a great thing. When the people's police began to be criticized by the masses, some people were ideologically unable to accept it and thought, "The police represent the state, how can I work in the future if I am criticized like this!" However, after the help of leaders and the education of the masses, the vast majority of the police truly understood that the criticism of the masses is a good thing, is the most sincere love and care for the police, and is also the most powerful support. The police improved their awareness and universally launched a campaign to love the people and do good things for the masses, and many moving events emerged. In many places, the masses called the police "good police of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." It should be explained that whether the masses dare to criticize us is an important criterion for measuring whether the relationship between public security personnel and the masses is normal. The people's public security organs have truly obtained the supervision of the masses, coupled with the leadership and supervision of the Party, and our affairs will be easy to handle, and serious mistakes can be avoided. As long as we work hard, things will surely be done better.

In order to further implement the mass line, it is necessary to criticize various erroneous views that are unwilling to mobilize the masses and afraid of mobilizing the masses, and it is necessary to completely liberate public security work from the remaining influence of isolationism and mysticism.

The vigorous actions of the broad masses have broken through many invisible shackles in the thinking of public security cadres. For example, some people thought that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of counter-revolutionaries movements could boldly mobilize the masses, while the routine work of investigation and security was not suitable for mobilizing the masses; eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionaries could follow the mass line, while the struggle against hidden enemies seemed impossible to follow the mass line; various preventive measures could rely on the masses, while investigation and case solving could not rely on the masses, or it was thought that criminal cases could rely on the masses, while political cases were even more impossible to rely on the masses. Some people also opposed following the mass line to keeping work secrets. Some people even underestimated the degree of awareness of the masses today, and were afraid that mobilizing the masses would disrupt things. Facts have proved that the above-mentioned views are untenable. Moreover, it is these erroneous ideas that seriously hinder the implementation of the mass line. We should further collect many vivid examples and conduct sufficient educational work to effectively overcome various erroneous ideas, and completely liberate public security work from the remaining influence of isolationism and mysticism. Only in this way can the mass line have a comprehensive and more sufficient development in all aspects of public security work.

To further implement the mass line, seven things should be done well.

In order to further implement the mass line and make the public security organs more mass-based and more revolutionary, we believe that the following things should be done well:

Liberate thinking and establish a strong mass viewpoint

First, it is necessary to solve the ideological problem. Among all public security cadres, it is necessary to establish a strong mass viewpoint and continue to criticize and overcome the "three isms" and "five airs" that hinder the implementation of the mass line. We must strive to liberate our minds, try to get rid of the constraints of functionalism and the purely professional viewpoint, so that our vision is broader, our knowledge is richer, and our minds are more lively. We must advocate looking at the big picture, looking at the whole picture, and looking at the development, be diligent in independent thinking, and dare to be bold in creating. To this end, we must work hard to study, seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and carefully read several books on Marxism-Leninism. We must make the leading cadres of public security at all levels understand some materialistic dialectics as much as possible.

Seriously value and support the creations of the masses

Second, we must seriously value and support the creations of the masses. Now, many places across the country are carrying out activities to create safe communities, safe townships, safe streets, and safe units around the central work of the great leap forward in production. The masses have consciously risen up, and under the leadership of the Party, have adopted various methods to prevent fire, theft, special agents, and gambling. They have implemented supervised labor and reformed the five categories of elements: landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have organized witches, sorcerers, idlers, and lazy people who do not engage in production into production for education and transformation. In many places, the masses also universally formulated socialist patriotic covenants and conducted self-education and self-restraint in the later stages of the rectification movement. These have played a great role in ensuring the safety of the masses' great leap forward in production and in further consolidating the socialist social order in rural and urban areas. This is an important development in the implementation of the mass line in public security work, and public security organs at all levels should pay attention to summarizing and disseminating the advanced experiences created by the masses.

Combine with the center and combine with production to complete the task

Third, public security work must learn to combine with the center and combine with production to complete its tasks. It is necessary to go to the masses to contact the masses, and go to production to protect production. Public security cadres must learn not only the knowledge of class struggle, but also the knowledge of production struggle. It is becoming increasingly clear that if public security personnel do not understand production knowledge, do not participate in production, and do not combine with production, they are in danger of being separated from the masses, they are in danger of making their local tasks deviate from the overall political tasks, and they are in danger of deviating from the leadership of the Party committee, and of course, they will not be able to complete their tasks.

Effectively reform leadership methods and organizational work

Fourth, there must be effective reforms in the leadership methods and organizational work of the public security organs. The leadership force of the public security organs must be organized and go to the grassroots level, to the forefront of the struggle, and directly participate in the actual struggle there. Within the public security system, from the minister to the head of the police station, the leadership method of "experimental fields" should be universally promoted. Leading cadres at the ministerial and bureau levels of the Ministry of Public Security should often go down to inspect work, and the attitude of inspecting work should be correct, that is, to put down their airs and sincerely ask the lower levels and the masses for advice. We must strive to gain experience and methods from the struggle and from the masses. All the powers and work that should continue to be delegated by the Ministry of Public Security should be fully delegated to give full play to the initiative of the local public security organs.

Check and revise various rules and regulations

Fifth, the rules and regulations of the public security organs should be checked. Those that are suitable for the situation should be adhered to, those that are not completely suitable for the situation should be revised, and those that are completely unsuitable for the situation should be resolutely abolished. The rules and regulations should allow the masses to break through and fully support the new creations of the masses. The Xincheng Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau broke the system of residents reporting household registration to the police station and implemented the police accepting household registration on the doorstep, which not only facilitated the masses, but also helped the police to closely contact the masses. The Traffic Department of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on the flat road surface of Shanghai, after careful research, changed the national unified regulations and allowed a suitable increase in the load capacity of transportation vehicles under the condition that driving safety is guaranteed. The result is equivalent to an increase of 500 Jiefang brand trucks in the city. These two examples are good illustrations. When implementing the correct rules and regulations, it should also proceed from facilitating production and should not hinder production. When dealing with internal problems of the people, we must adhere to the method of persuasion. Punishment and detention can only be supplementary means in the case of necessity. It is completely wrong to abuse detention and punishment for internal problems of the people.

Effectively strengthen various specialized business work

Sixth, it is necessary to effectively strengthen the various specialized business work of the public security organs. Implementing the mass line not only does not hinder the development of specialized work, but also is more conducive to strengthening specialized work. In various business work, we must not only boldly follow the mass line and attract more people to do the work, but also summarize experience, study the business, and improve our skills on the basis of the mass line, so as to train a group of truly capable professional teams who are familiar with policies, contact the masses, and are proficient in business to defeat formidable enemies.

Correctly solve the relationship between public security personnel and the people

Seventh, conscientiously and correctly solve the relationship between public security personnel and the people, and build the people's public security organs into public security organs that are truly integrated with the masses, feared by bad people, and loved by the people. Only when public security personnel truly become people loved by the people can they be truly feared by the enemy. The number of police in the public security organs is the largest, and their contact with the masses is the most direct, the most extensive, and the most frequent. Much work must be done through the police to contact the masses. Therefore, earnestly improving police-people relations is the main part of improving the relationship between public security personnel and the masses.

As long as the national public security organs adhere to the correct line of the Party, they will certainly be able to limit the activities of counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, and the influence of hostile classes, to the smallest possible scope, thereby providing a safe guarantee for the great leap forward of socialist construction.

At present, the situation of the struggle between the enemy and us, on the whole, shows that the strength of the class enemy has been further weakened, the five categories of elements – landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists – are turning more towards bowing their heads and disintegration, and the socialist social order has been further consolidated. However, the five categories of elements – landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists – still need to be thoroughly reformed, and a portion of the resolute counter-revolutionaries will still carry out sabotage, and some are already desperately carrying out sabotage. There are still a number of residual counter-revolutionaries in the country who have not been eliminated. They are more often hidden in mountainous areas, border areas, waters, certain junction zones, and certain ethnic minority areas. A batch is disguised and wandering around. As for the special agent organs of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, their activities are still very active, sending people by land, smuggling by sea, transporting explosives, and engaging in destructive actions. Therefore, many places, especially coastal and border areas and some large cities, will still have tense struggles.

At present, our struggle with the enemy mainly has two aspects: one is to focus on cracking down on the current sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, while continuing to eliminate the remaining major counter-revolutionaries who have escaped; the other is to focus on adopting various methods to transform the large number of five categories of elements – landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists – to force them to take the socialist road, mobilize their hands to participate in building socialism, transform negative factors into positive factors, and strive to transform the majority of them into self-reliant laborers. For a portion of those who adhere to the reactionary stance, they will not be given the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities, so that they dare not reach out, and if they reach out, it will be difficult to escape our blows. Therefore, the people of the whole country still have arduous tasks and a considerable arduous and complex struggle. We must continue to consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship. To crack down on the enemy's current sabotage activities, complete the arduous transformation tasks, and prevent counter-revolutionary bacteria from spreading, a strong proletarian dictatorship is an indispensable condition.

There are still counter-revolutionaries, but not many. This is the fundamental estimate. After more than a year of struggle from the autumn and winter of 1956 to the present, it should be seen that the strength of the counter-revolutionaries has been further weakened. If we do our work better, we can further eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries and promote the easing of the situation of the struggle between the enemy and us, making the social order more stable. However, will the situation of the struggle between the enemy and us continue to ease without repetition? It should be estimated that there may still be some repetitions, and it should also be prepared that there may still be some troubles. Our policy is still a policy of combining punishment with leniency. If the counter-revolutionaries can sincerely repent, no longer carry out sabotage, and surrender to the government or perform meritorious service to redeem themselves, they will be treated leniently. If the residual enemies raise their heads again under certain conditions, then our hands and feet are not tied up, and we will definitely give the enemy a more powerful blow.

Our public security work, in order to protect the great leap forward of the great socialist construction, should also have a great leap forward in all aspects suitable for its own situation and tasks. It should be seen that with the great development of production, the increasing prosperity of the people's lives, and the increasing improvement of socialist consciousness, coupled with our subjective efforts, our public security work will certainly be done better and faster. The national public security organs should continue to adhere to the correct line of the Party, and under the leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, further rely on the masses, and combine the work of the specialized organs more closely with the strength of the broad masses, boost their energy, aim high, limit the activities of counter-revolutionaries and other criminals and the influence of hostile classes to the smallest possible scope, and make our country's socialist social order more stable, thereby providing a full guarantee of safety for the great leap forward of socialist construction.

### 公安工作必须进一步地贯彻群众路线

　　公安工作必须进一步地贯彻群众路线
　　国务院第一办公室主任兼公安部部长  罗瑞卿
    我国社会主义建设正处在全面大跃进的高潮中。我们坚信，在党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议所确立的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导和鼓舞下，全国人民的社会主义的积极性和创造性，一定会更加高涨，一定会进一步地促进我国工农业生产和文化事业飞跃地发展，从而迅速改变我国经济和文化的落后面貌。一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家的出现，已经指日可待。在这种情况下，更好地保卫社会主义建设全面大跃进的安全，就成为全国公安工作面前的光荣任务。
    把公安工作置于党中央和各级党委的绝对领导之下，并在工作中实行放手发动群众，大胆依靠群众的路线，这是我们党在长期革命实践中一个独特的创造。
    我国的公安工作，是在党中央、毛泽东同志和各级党委的密切领导下进行的。公安工作的路线，是党中央和毛泽东同志，根据马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的原理，结合我们国家的情况所创立、发展和完备起来的。它的根本特点就是党委领导和群众路线。这条路线的形成，是经过了同它的对立面——垂直领导、孤立主义和神秘主义的严重斗争的。把公安工作置于党中央和各级党委的绝对领导之下，并在工作中实行放手动员群众、大胆依靠群众的路线，这是我们党在长期革命实践中一个独特的创造。
    全国公安机关执行党的路线，是坚决的，忠实的。在服从党委领导这个方面，思想上是明确的。中央和各级党委对公安机关的领导，不仅在方针政策上，而且在领导关系、组织形式上都有明确的规定，工作上的实际领导也是密切的。因此，一般说，这个方面的问题，已经比较好地解决了。各级公安机关当然还应该继续注意，决不要容忍任何离开党委领导的思想和行动。
    使公安机关充分革命化和充分群众化，让群众路线在公安工作的一切方面有一个新的发展，就大大有利于公安工作在保卫社会主义建设中的全面大跃进。
    公安工作贯彻群众路线的情况怎样呢？一般说来，也是良好的，充分的，就某些方面来看，还可以说是出色的。但是，能不能说群众路线在公安工作的所有方面都很充分了呢？决不能这样说。公安工作中某些方面还有贯彻群众路线不够充分的缺点，在一些事情上，甚至还有某些违背群众路线，严重脱离群众的错误。孤立主义和神秘主义的残余，少数人当中特权思想的残余，还是存在着的。同时，形势发展了，群众觉悟提高了，公安工作的群众路线，还应当继续发展。如果说，贯彻群众路线是八年来公安工作取得胜利的带决定性的关键问题，那么，进一步地贯彻群众路线，使公安机关“充分革命化”和“充分群众化”，彻底克服孤立主义、神秘主义的残余，彻底清除特权思想的残余，让群众路线在公安工作的一切方面有一个新的发展，对于今后公安工作更好地保卫社会主义建设全面大跃进，就不能不具有十分重大的意义。
    公安工作中有那些贯彻群众路线还不充分的表现呢？
    从侦察保卫工作方面来看，就有群众路线贯彻不充分的缺点。八年多以来，在同美蒋特务的斗争中，侦察工作是有成绩的，但是还有孤立主义和神秘主义的残余，特别是从工作发展的需要来看，问题就更为突出。主要表现为只相信自己，不相信群众；只相信上面，不相信下面；迷信某些技术，看不到人的作用。没有真正懂得专门机关和广大群众相结合，可以使我们的调查研究工作做得更好，可以使我们同隐蔽敌人的斗争进行得更加顺利。在一些侦察人员的思想里，对侦察工作能否走群众路线，实际上还抱着某种怀疑态度。不彻底解决这个问题，侦察工作就不能够在对敌斗争中显示出它应有的力量。
    在各项保卫工作方面，几年来，工厂、企业、机关、学校内部的保卫工作，是有成绩的。但是，贯彻群众路线不充分的缺点，也是存在着的。在这个方面，曾经有一个时期，不适当地强调一些脱离实际的秘密侦察工作；有一些保卫工作部门比较普遍地忽视同破坏事故和刑事犯罪分子的斗争，表现了对生产的现实利益和对群众的切身利益关心不够；建立了一些不适合情况的保卫制度和保密制度，限制过多，既不利于生产，又增加群众的麻烦。这样，就不能不使我们的保卫工作，在一定程度上脱离了群众。如果不彻底纠正这些缺点，各项保卫工作，就不可能更好地去完成经济战线上和文化战线上的保卫任务。
    在这里，还应该检查一下公安人员同人民群众的关系。
    公安人员同人民群众的关系，基本上是好的，但是还有问题。从人民警察的情况来看，真正有为人民服务的精神，真正同群众打成一片，为群众所喜欢的，只是其中的一部分。基本上好、但有缺点，群众喜欢、但有意见的，则占多数。这些人表现出来的最普遍的缺点，就是在人民群众中进行工作的时候，态度不好，说话不和气，不是用平等精神待人；由于政治觉悟不高，或者由于有骄傲思想和特权思想，不把自己的职务看成是为人民服务，作人民的勤务员，相反的，还常常以“管人”、“训人”、“命令人”的姿态出现。这样，就在某种程度上，把处理“两类矛盾”的方法，混淆起来，以致他们虽然也为群众办了一些事情，但同时又不能不造成他们同群众之间有一定的隔阂。还有少数人，沾染了国民党警察的作风，由于他们的作风恶劣，不仅不给群众办好事，还干坏事，例如利用职权，看白戏，买东西应该站队不站队，甚至故意刁难群众，违法乱纪。因而群众是很不喜欢的，甚至厌恶他们。这些人，有一些是犯了严重错误的，个别的则是混进来或蜕化了的坏分子。有后一种情形的人，为数当然很少，但问题的性质是严重的。应该指出，所有上述这些缺点和错误，当然不只是人民警察中才有，在其他公安人员中也是有的。因此，在公安人员中，如果不彻底克服骄傲思想和特权思想，如果不全部扫掉国民党警察作风的影响，不仅会妨害公安人员同人民的团结，妨害正确处理人民内部矛盾，也妨害在工作中进一步贯彻群众路线。
    此外，在其他业务工作上，也还程度不同地存在着群众观点不强，群众路线不充分的缺点。至于思想作风上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，缺乏平等态度对待下级和人民群众的缺点，根据整风的检查，虽然程度不同，但是上下皆有；整风后有显著改变，也还需要继续注意改进。
    整风中出现的许多生动事实，说明群众路线在公安工作中不仅大有发展余地，而且已经在很多方面有了新的发展。
    最近以来，由于整风的结果，出现了许多生动事实，说明了公安工作群众路线不仅大有发展余地，而且已经在很多方面有了新的发展。
    哪里发现了反动标语，就组织那里的群众去看，用具体事实教育群众，提高警惕，发动大家讨论，提供线索，结果很快就破了案。
    例如过去很多地方对于反动标语案件，办法不多，破案很少。哪里发现了反动标语，公安人员就去勘察情况，然后将反动标语悄悄擦去，再悄悄地去寻找可疑分子，虽然也在群众中做些调查，但仍然是关起门来破案，其结果是费力大，效果小。真所谓“带起碓窝跳加官，吃力不讨好”。现在很多地方采取了新的办法：哪里发现了反动标语，就组织那里的群众去看，用具体事实教育群众，提高警惕，发动大家讨论，提供线索，实行公安人员同群众相结合，侦察部门的专门工作同群众识别相结合，结果很快就破了案。武汉市文教部门的保卫组织采用这种群众路线的办法，今年2月底到3月底，一个月就破了反动标语好多起，不仅及时破了现行的案子，把过去的积案也破了。许多地方由于解放了思想，改进了方法，这项斗争的形势就发生了新的变化。我们的干部不再为反动标语苦恼了，学会了用它来教育群众，用它发现暗藏的反革命分子，又从中得到了侦察工作同群众相结合的经验，一箭三雕，把坏事化为了好事。大跃进中许多地方由于实行了群众路线，破了大量的案件，还破了一些过去长期破不了的疑难案件，发现了一些侦察部门难于知道的情况。例如辽宁省营口县的一件凶杀案，很长时间没有破获。这次安全运动中，被害者的女儿当众沉痛申诉，请求乡亲们为她伸冤作主，深深地激动了所有的人，在场的一个老太太，原来就知道凶手是谁，但长期不敢讲，这时，由于觉悟提高了，马上挺身出来说：“拼上这条老命不要啦，我给你作主！”于是案情大白。可见侦察工作只要真正贯彻了群众路线，它的局面也就大为改观。
    由于采取了群众动员，大家动手的办法，消防工作大大加强，火灾大大减少。
    又如消防工作在今年大跃进中，由于充分发动了群众，群众想出了各种各样防火的好办法，浙江沿海地区，群众提出“灶前清，灶膛浅、水缸满，烟筒光”的办法，订了防火公约和检查制度，大大减少了火灾发生。同时掏出来的烟灰，还起了积肥的作用。武汉市棚户区过去多次发生大火，损失很大。今年春季，根据群众鸣放提出的要求，采取群众动员，大家动手的办法，在很短的时间内，检修了四十五万多户炉灶，有十一万多户不安全的炉灶修了防火墙。其他城市也有这样做的，从最近情况看，已经有了很大效果。像这样的事，是过去多少年办不到的，群众动员起来，就很快办到了。
    群众敢于批评警察，而且用大字报的形式公开指名批评，这是古今中外都没有的，是一件极大的好事。
    在警民关系上，最近以来，也有了一些新气象。各地在全民整风运动中，广大群众通过大鸣大放大字报，对人民警察提出了很多很好的批评和建议。北京街道、上海里弄鸣放的大字报，就有很多是对派出所民警提意见的，所有民警都从中受到了一次非常深刻的教育。从群众鸣放的大字报里，可以看出，群众对民警已经打破顾虑，是把民警当作自己人了。群众敢于批评警察，而且用贴大字报的形式公开指名批评，这是古今中外都没有的，是一件极大的好事。人民警察开始受到群众批评的时候，有些人思想不通，认为“警察是代表国家的，这样批评，我今后怎么工作呀！”但是经过领导帮助和群众教育，绝大多数民警真正明白了：群众批评是好事，是对民警的最真心的爱护，也是最有力的支持。民警提高了觉悟，普遍地掀起了爱民运动，为群众办好事，出现了很多动人的事例。很多地方，群众称民警为“共产党和毛主席的好警察。”应该说明：群众敢不敢批评我们，这是衡量公安人员同群众关系正常与否的重要标准。人民公安机关真正取得了群众的监督，再加上党的领导和监督，我们的事情就好办了，就可以避免发生严重错误。只要我们努力，事情就一定可以办得更好。
    为了进一步贯彻群众路线，必须批判各种各样不愿发动群众和害怕发动群众的错误观点，必须使公安工作从现在还有的孤立主义、神秘主义的残余影响中彻底解放出来。
    广大群众的生气勃勃的行动，冲破了公安干部思想上的许多无形的束缚。例如，有人以为镇反和肃反运动可以放手发动群众，而侦察、保卫等经常业务，就不适于发动群众；肃清残余的反革命分子可以走群众路线，而同隐蔽的敌人斗争，似乎就不能走群众路线；各种防范措施可以依靠群众，而侦察破案就无法依靠群众，或者认为刑事案件还可以依靠群众，而政治案件就更无法依靠群众。也有人把走群众路线同保守工作秘密对立起来。甚至有人过低地估计了今天群众的觉悟程度，还害怕发动了群众，会把事情搞乱。事实已经证明了，上面这些看法，都是站不住脚的。而且，正是这些错误的思想，严重地阻碍着群众路线的贯彻。我们应当进一步搜集许多生动的事例，进行充分的教育工作来有效地克服各种各样的错误思想，使公安工作从现在还有的孤立主义、神秘主义的残余影响中彻底解放出来，只有这样，才能让群众路线在公安工作的一切方面，有一个全面的更加充分的发展。
    要进一步贯彻群众路线，应当办好的七件事。
    为了进一步贯彻群众路线，使公安机关更加群众化和更加革命化，我们认为应当办好以下几件事：
    解放思想，树立坚强的群众观点
    第一、要解决思想问题，在全体公安干部中，要树立起坚强的群众观点，继续批判和克服妨碍群众路线贯彻的“三个主义”和“五气”。要努力解放思想，力求摆脱事务主义和单纯业务观点的束缚，使我们的视野广阔一些，知识丰富一些，头脑生动活泼一些。要提倡看大局，看全面，看发展，勤于独立思考，敢于大胆创造。为此，就要下苦功夫学习，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，认真读几本马克思列宁主义的书，要使各级公安领导干部都尽可能懂得一些唯物论辩证法。
    认真重视和支持群众的创造
    第二、要认真重视和支持群众的创造。现在全国很多地方围绕生产大跃进的中心工作，都在开展创造安全社、安全乡、安全街道、安全单位的运动。群众自觉起来，在党的领导下，采取各种办法，防火、防盗、防特、禁赌。对地、富、反、坏、右五类分子实行监督劳动，加以改造。对不事生产的巫婆神汉和二流子懒汉，把他们组织到生产中进行教育改造。许多地方，群众在整风后期，还普遍订立社会主义爱国公约，进行自我教育，自我约束。这些都对保证群众生产大跃进的安全，对进一步巩固农村和城市社会主义的社会秩序，有很大的作用。这是治安工作实行群众路线的一个重要的发展，各级公安机关应该注意总结和传播为群众所创造的先进经验。
    结合中心，结合生产去完成任务
    第三、公安工作要学会结合中心，结合生产去完成自己的任务。要到群众中去联系群众，到生产中去保卫生产。公安干部既要学会阶级斗争的知识，也要学习生产斗争的知识。事情愈来愈明白，不懂得生产知识，不参加生产，不同生产结合起来，公安人员就有脱离群众的危险，就有使自己局部的任务脱离总的政治任务的危险，就有脱离党委领导的危险，当然也就无法完成自己的任务。
    切实改革领导方法和组织工作
    第四、公安机关的领导方法和组织工作要有切实的改革，要把公安机关的领导力量组织起来，到基层去，到斗争的最前线去，直接参加那里的实际斗争。在公安系统内，从部长到派出所长，要普遍推广“试验田”的领导方法，公安部的部、局两级领导干部，要经常到下面去考察工作，而且考察工作的态度要正确，这就是要放下架子，真心真意的向下级请教，向群众请教，要努力从斗争中、群众中取得经验，取得方法。公安部一切应该继续下放的权力和工作，都要全部下放，充分发挥地方公安机关的积极性。
    检查和修改各种规章制度
    第五、公安机关的规章制度要加以检查，适合情况的要坚持，不完全适合情况的要修改，完全不合情况的要坚决废除。规章制度要允许群众突破，要充分支持群众中的新的创造。上海新成分局打破了居民到派出所报户口的制度，实行民警上门接受报户口，既便利了群众，又有利于民警密切联系群众。上海市公安局交通处，根据上海路面平坦的情况，经过仔细研究，改变了全国统一的规定，在行车安全有保证的条件下，允许适当增加运输汽车的载重量，其结果等于全市增加了五百辆解放牌卡车。这两个例子，就是很好的说明。在执行正确的规章制度的时候，也要从便利生产出发，不应该妨碍生产。在处理人民内部问题的时候，要坚持说服的办法，处罚和拘留只能是不得已情况下的辅助手段。对于人民内部的问题，滥用拘留和处罚是完全错误的。
    切实加强各项专门业务工作
    第六、要切实加强公安机关的各项专门业务工作。实行群众路线，不仅不妨碍专门工作的发展，而且更有利于专门工作的加强。各项业务工作，既要放手走群众路线，吸引更多的人来做工作；又要在群众路线的基础上，总结经验，钻研业务，提高本领，以便锻炼出一批真正精干的、熟悉政策、联系群众、精通业务的专业队伍，去战胜厉害的敌人。
    正确解决公安人员同人民群众的关系
    第七、认真地正确地解决公安人员同人民群众的关系，把人民公安机关建设成为真正同群众打成一片，为坏人所怕、为人民所爱的公安机关。公安人员，只有真正成为人民所爱的人，才会是敌人所真正害怕的人。公安机关中民警的数量最多，同群众的接触最直接，最广泛，最频繁，许多工作都要通过民警去联系群众。因此，认真改进警民关系，是改善公安人员同群众关系的主要部分。
    全国公安机关只要坚持党的正确路线，就一定能够把反革命和其他犯罪分子的活动，把敌对阶级的影响，限制在最小的范围以内，从而为社会主义建设大跃进，提供安全的保证。
    目前敌我斗争的形势，就总的情况看，阶级敌人的力量更加削弱了，地、富、反、坏、右五类分子更转向低头和分化，社会主义的社会秩序进一步巩固了。但是，地、富、反、坏、右五类分子还有待于彻底的改造，其中一部分坚决的反革命分子还会进行破坏，有些已经在那里拼命进行破坏。全国还有一批残余的反革命分子没有肃清，他们比较多地藏在山区、边区、水上、某些结合地带和某些少数民族地区，有一批则是伪装起来到处流窜。至于帝国主义和蒋介石的特务机关，它们的活动仍然十分积极，陆地派遣，海上偷渡，运炸药，搞行动破坏。因此许多地方，特别是沿海沿边地区和某些大城市，还会有紧张的斗争。
    现在我们同敌人的斗争主要有两个方面：一方面是着重打击反革命分子和其他犯罪分子的现行破坏活动，同时继续肃清残余漏网的重大反革命分子；另一方面则是着重采取各种方式，改造大量的地、富、反、坏、右五类分子，要强迫他们走社会主义道路，调动他们的双手，去参加建设社会主义，变消极因素为积极因素，尽量争取把其中的多数改造成为自食其力的劳动者。对于一部分坚持反动立场的分子，也不给他们以进行破坏活动的机会，使他们不敢伸手，一伸手，就难于逃避我们的打击。因此，全国人民面前还有艰巨的任务，还有相当艰苦的复杂的斗争。应当继续巩固我国的无产阶级专政。要打击敌人的现行破坏活动，完成艰巨的改造任务，并使反革命细菌不能蔓延，强大的无产阶级专政，就是必不可少的条件。
    反革命还有，但是不多了，这是根本估计，在经过了从1956年秋冬到现在一年多来的斗争之后，应该看到，反革命的力量更大的削弱了，再加上我们的工作做得更好一些，就可以进一步消灭残余的反革命分子，促进敌我斗争形势的缓和，使社会秩序更加安定。但是，敌我斗争形势是否就一直缓和下去，不再反复了呢？应该估计到还可能有一些反复，也应该准备还可能出一些乱子。我们的政策仍然是惩办与宽大相结合的政策，如果反革命分子能够真心悔罪，不再进行破坏，并向政府投案自首，或者立功自赎，他们就会得到宽大处理；如果残余的敌人在一定条件下又有所抬头，那么，我们的手足并没有被束缚起来，我们一定会给敌人更加有力的打击。
    我们的公安工作，为了保卫伟大的社会主义建设的大跃进，也应该在各方面有一个适合自己情况和任务的大跃进。应该看到，随着生产的大发展，人民生活的日益兴旺，社会主义觉悟的日益提高，再加上我们主观的努力，我们的公安工作就一定会做得更好一些，更快一些。全国公安机关应该继续坚持党的正确路线，在中央和各级党委的领导下，进一步地依靠群众，把专门机关的工作同广大群众的力量更加密切地结合起来，鼓起干劲，力争上游，把反革命和其他犯罪分子的活动，把敌对阶级的影响，限制在最小的范围以内，使我国社会主义的社会秩序更加安定，从而为社会主义建设大跃进，提供充分的安全保证。
