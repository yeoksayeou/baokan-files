　　Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 8th: Seven coastal provinces, including Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei, Liaoning, and Shandong, recently consulted in Lüda City to launch large-scale socialist collaboration and vigorously carry out kelp seedling cultivation, laying a good foundation for producing more than one million tons of kelp next year.
　　After the National Aquatic Products Conference in February this year put forward the resounding slogan of making China's aquatic product aquaculture industry rank first in the world during the Second Five-Year Plan, the aquatic product aquaculture departments in Shandong and Lüda broke with conservatism and determined to double and redouble the local kelp production. The southern coastal provinces, which had no history of kelp cultivation and only completed the southern kelp transplantation experiment the year before last, also boldly tried and proposed a grand plan for artificial kelp cultivation.
　　In order to develop the kelp aquaculture industry in the southern coastal provinces, the seven coastal provinces, after consultation, jointly formed the National Kelp Seedling Cultivation Committee, determined to cultivate a large number of kelp seedlings in the Lüda sea area in the spirit of communist collaboration of "I for everyone, everyone for me," contributing money and labor. In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical strength in seedling cultivation, the aquatic product aquaculture departments in Shandong Province and Lüda City decided to complete their own seedling cultivation tasks and resolutely support the southern provinces in seedling cultivation. Shandong Province decided to send more than 30 of the existing 40-odd technicians and technical workers with seedling cultivation experience. The Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong University and other units also enthusiastically expressed their willingness to undertake obligations in technology, and the difficulty of insufficient kelp seedling cultivation technology was successfully resolved. The National Kelp Seedling Cultivation Committee decided to cultivate 3 billion seedlings for Hebei and the four southern provinces this year.
　　At present, the preparatory work for seedling cultivation is in full swing. Moso bamboo and hemp rope and other seedling cultivation equipment that are difficult to find in Lüda are continuously shipped from the southern provinces, and Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang and other provinces have begun to transfer fishermen with offshore operation experience to the Lüda seedling cultivation area.
　　A person in charge of the National Kelp Seedling Cultivation Committee told reporters that due to the rapid development of kelp seedling cultivation, kelp vegetables can be planted all over the vast sea areas from Lüda in the north to Fujian in the south this year. Next year, the national annual kelp production will be 100 times or 150 times that of 1957, and China's historical situation of importing kelp can be changed into exporting to foreign countries.

### 沿海七省协作养育海带

　　沿海七省协作养育海带
    新华社旅大8日电　福建、广东、浙江、江苏、河北、辽宁和山东等沿海七省，最近在旅大市协商展开社会主义大协作，大力开展海带育苗工作，为明年年产海带一百万多吨打好基础。
    今年2月，全国水产会议提出要在第二个五年计划期间，使我国水产养殖事业跃居世界首位的响亮口号以后，山东和旅大的水产养殖部门都大破保守，确定要使当地海带年产量一翻再翻；历史上没有养殖过海带、前年才完成海带南移试验的南方沿海各省也大胆尝试，提出了人工养殖海带的宏伟计划。
    为了发展南方沿海各省海带养殖事业，沿海七省经过协商，共同组成了全国海带育苗委员会，确定本着我为人人、人人为我的共产主义协作精神，有钱出钱，有力出力，通力协作在旅大海区大量养育海带苗。为解决育苗技术力量不足的问题，山东省和旅大市的水产养殖部门，决定一面完成自己的育苗任务，一面坚决支援南方各省育苗。山东省决定从现有的四十几个有育苗经验的技术员和技术工人中，派出三十几个。中国科学院海洋生物研究所和山东大学等单位也热情地表示愿意在技术上承担义务，因海带育苗技术不足的困难顺利解决。全国海带育苗委员会确定今年为河北和南方四省育苗三十亿棵。
    现在，育苗的准备工作正在紧张进行。旅大很难找到的毛竹和麻绳等育苗器材都由南方各省源源运来，福建、广东、浙江等省并开始把有海上作业经验的渔民调到旅大育苗区。
    全国海带育苗委员会的一位负责人对记者说，由于海带育苗工作的迅速开展，北起旅大，南到福建的广大海区今年都能遍种海带菜，明年，全国的海带年产量将是1957年的一百倍或者是一百五十倍，我国历史上进口海带的情况可以一变而为向国外出口。
