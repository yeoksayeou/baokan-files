Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 1st: The Mule and Horse Cart Transportation Cooperative of Baixia District in Nanjing City has recently used indigenous methods to produce biogas. The method is simple, costing only a little over ten yuan, and can be used for lighting and heating.

The people who experimented with producing biogas using indigenous methods were Li Nong, the cooperative's director, and Zhu Youming, the production team leader. Both of them were mule cart drivers and did not previously understand how to produce biogas.

In early April, Li Nong and Zhu Youming saw news in the newspaper that biogas could be produced from cattle dung and horse manure. They thought about setting up a biogas factory, and Li Nong went to visit the biogas research group of the Municipal Industrial Bureau. They saw various pieces of equipment in the fermentation tank; the fermentation tank was made of reinforced concrete, and a set of fermentation tank equipment would cost at least four or five thousand yuan. How could a small cooperative come up with so much money to set up a biogas factory?

However, after they understood the principle of sealed fermentation in the fermentation tank, they used a large cement cylinder originally used as a watering trough for livestock to replace the fermentation tank. They used an old wooden board as a lid for sealing, and used a bamboo tube connected to the bottom, using a stirrer through the hollow of the bamboo tube, and used a thermometer that measures livestock body temperature instead of a thermometer to measure the temperature inside the tank. They also erected a thin iron pipe on the wooden cover, which released the biogas. In just about ten days, the released biogas lit the biogas lamp and heated the biogas stove. The entire equipment cost only a little over ten yuan, the method is simple and easy to understand. Moreover, this type of fermentation tank is similar to the form of rural manure pits, which opens up a broad path for the widespread and rapid development of biogas production in rural areas.

The feeding technology requirements for the earthen-made fermentation tank are also very simple. In a fermentation tank of 0.81 cubic meters, 600 jin of horse manure, 120 jin of river mud, and 600 jin of water are mixed together. One feeding can continuously produce biogas for 30 days. Now they are planning to expand the capacity of the fermentation tank to increase biogas production. The achievements of Li Nong and Zhu Youming in producing biogas using indigenous methods once again prove that ordinary laborers have infinite intelligence and talent. As long as they have a slight grasp of scientific knowledge and principles, they can break through the shackles of superstition and mystery and create miracles.

### 平凡的劳动  无穷的智慧  赶骡车工人用土办法制出沼气

    平凡的劳动  无穷的智慧
    赶骡车工人用土办法制出沼气
    据新华社南京1日电　南京市白下区骡马车运输合作社最近用土办法制出沼气，方法简单，只花了十多块钱，就可以点灯和发热。
    试验用土法出沼气的是这个社的社长李农和生产队长朱有明，他们二人都是赶骡车的工人，过去并不懂得生产沼气。
    4月上旬，李农和朱有明看到报上登载用牛粪、马粪可以生产沼气的消息，就想到办一个沼气工厂，李农便到市工业局沼气研究小组去参观；看到发酵池内有各式设备；发酵池是钢筋水泥结构，造一套发酵池的设备最少得四、五千元。一个小小的合作社，哪能拿出这么多钱来办沼气工厂呢？
    但是，当他们懂得了发酵池密封发酵的原理以后，他们就用大水泥筒做成的牲口饮水池代替发酵池，上面用旧木板做成的盖子作密封之用，用一根竹筒子通到下面，通过竹筒的中空，使用搅拌器，并用测量牲口体温的温度表代替温度计测量池内温度，又在木头盖上面竖起一根细长的铁管子，这样就放出了沼气。前后只有十天左右，放出的沼气照样点亮了沼气灯、烧热了沼气炉。全部设备不过十多块钱，方法简单，一看就懂；而且，这种发酵池跟农村的粪坑形式类似，这就为农村广泛而迅速地发展沼气生产开辟了广阔的道路。
    土造发酵池的投料技术要求也很简单。在一个零点八一立方公尺的发酵池内，用六百斤马粪、一百二十斤河泥、六百斤水搅拌即成；一次投料可以连续生产沼气三十天。现在他们正在计划把发酵池的容量扩大，增加沼气产量。李农和朱有明用土办法出沼气的成就，再一次证明了平凡的劳动者有无穷的聪明和才智，他们只要稍稍掌握科学的知识和原理，就能冲破迷信和神秘的束缚，干出奇迹来。
