Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 10th: The Karamay Oilfield is entering a new stage of simultaneous exploration and development. Preparations are intensively underway for the large-scale development of the known oilfield area, and various oilfield construction projects adapted to oilfield development have also been fully launched.

After three years of large-scale drilling, the Karamay Oilfield has now proven a large oil-bearing area and obtained considerable recoverable crude oil reserves. According to the state's need for crude oil, the proven part of this oilfield has been decided to be developed on a larger scale than planned, ahead of schedule.

At present, geologists and designers are working day and night calculating reserves, organizing data on the physical properties of the oilfield, and studying economically rational development plans. Drilling personnel are accelerating the drilling of a batch of appraisal wells.

The first batch of equipment for the oil transportation, oil selection, and oil gathering systems in the oil production area has already begun construction. These projects include various oil selection stations, oil gathering stations, oil transportation hubs, and oil pipelines, insulated steam pipelines, and water supply pipelines for transporting crude oil to these stations. Over 100 kilometers of oil pipelines transporting crude oil to various oil selection stations, oil gathering stations, and oil transportation hubs have already begun construction. Eight oil selection stations and one oil gathering station have been completed. Six oil selection stations are about to begin construction. The oil transportation hub, which gathers all the crude oil from the oil production area, has also recently broken ground. Projects such as high-voltage lines, low-voltage lines, and power plants supplying electricity to the development area, the telephone network in the development area, and water injection stations for injecting large amounts of water into the oilfield are also being put into construction one after another. The comprehensive mechanical repair plant, which undertakes various mechanical repair tasks for the oilfield, was completed and put into production in May this year. This comprehensive mechanical repair plant has eight workshops and can overhaul 300 diesel engines, 80 cars, and 45 drilling rigs annually. The first power station for supplying power and lighting to the mining area has been generating electricity since May.

In order to meet the large amount of electricity and engineering water required for oilfield development, a large-scale thermal power plant and a 65-kilometer-long water pipeline are currently under preparation, and the water pipeline will begin construction in the second half of the year.

    克拉玛依油田即将大规模开发
    新华社克拉玛依10日电　克拉玛依油田转入勘探和开发同时并进的新阶段。大规模开发油田已知面积的各项准备工作正在紧张进行，适应油田开发的各项油田建设工程也已经全面展开。
    克拉玛依油田经过三年大规模的钻探，现在已经探明一片很大的储油面积和获得了可观的可采原油储量。根据国家对原油的需要，这个油田探明的部分决定比计划提前进行较大规模的开采。
    目前地质人员和设计人员正在日夜忙着计算储量，整理油田物理性能的资料和研究经济合理的开发方案。钻井人员正在加速钻探一批估价井。
    采油区域第一批输油、选油和集油系统的设备已经动工兴建。这些工程包括各个选油站、集油站、输油总站和向这些站输送原油的油管线、保温的蒸气管线和给水管线。向各选油站、集油站和输油总站输送原油的一百多公里输油管线已经动工。有八个选油站和一个集油站已经建成。有六个选油站即将动工兴建。汇集采油区域所有原油的输油总站，最近也破土兴建。供给开采区域电力的高压线、低压线、发电所，开采区域的电话网，向油田大量注水的分井注水站等工程，现在也陆续动工。担负油田各种机械修理任务的综合机械修理厂今年5月已经建成投入生产。这个综合机械修理厂设有八个车间，每年可以大修柴油机三百台、汽车八十辆、钻机四十五台。供应矿区动力和照明用的第一座发电站，已在5月份发电。
    为了满足油田开发所需的大量电力和工程用水，一座规模较大的火力发电站和一条六十五公里长的输水管线目前已开始筹建，输水管线将在下半年动工。（附图片）
    最近，在克拉玛依—乌尔禾大断裂以南勘探的百口泉230号深探井，喷出了大量有开采价值的原油，这就大大地扩大了克拉玛依油田面积。这是工人在测量原油产量。（新疆石油工人报社稿）
