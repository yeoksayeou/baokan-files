    Work-Study Exhibition
    (By our newspaper) Nanjing, June 22nd—The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Nanjing University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing Agricultural College, Jiangsu Education College, and other units, recently jointly held the "Nanjing Area University Work-Study Exhibition."
    The exhibition has charts, specimens, models, materials, and physical objects, filling two buildings of the former Jiangsu Teachers' Advanced Training College. The exhibition content includes general introductions of various schools carrying out work-study programs, and the products produced and trial-produced by students in work-study labor. For example, the Physics and Chemistry Departments of Nanjing University have 57 new products. The more valuable teaching instruments self-made by the Physics Department include a sound standing wave instrument, a frequency analyzer, an amplifier without electronic tubes, and a "micro-current fuse." The "quartz microfilament," "cuprous oxide photovoltaic cell," "photoresistor," and "Lilio Lori force instrument" self-made by the Chemistry Department are currently not produced in China. The eight-and-a-half-inch reflecting telescope self-made by the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University is even more popular with the audience.

    勤工俭学展览会
    本报讯  江苏省教育厅、共青团江苏省委员会和南京大学、南京工学院、南京农学院、江苏教育学院等单位，最近联合举办了“南京地区高等学校勤工俭学展览会”。
    展览会上有图表、标本、模型、实物、书面材料，摆满了原江苏教师进修学院的二幢大楼。展览内容有各校开展勤工俭学的概况介绍，学生在勤工俭学劳动中所生产、试制的生产品等。如南京大学物理、化学二系，新产品有五十七种。物理系自制的比较贵重的教学仪器有声驻波仪、频率分析仪、不要电子管的扩音机、“微电流保险丝”。化学系自制的“石英微丝”、“氧化亚铜光伏电池”、“光敏电阻”、“利里奥利力仪”，这些产品目前国内尚未生产。南京大学数天系自制的八吋半反光天文望远镜，更为观众所喜爱。  （陆晋）
