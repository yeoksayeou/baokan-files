    Ode to the Great Leap Forward
    Lyrics by Tian Jian
    Music by Ma Ke
    [Singing Instructions] This song is suitable for solo performance. When singing, the emotions should be unrestrained, and the voice should be high-pitched and bright, like singing a mountain song. The rhythm and speed can be freely adjusted according to the needs of the emotions. The long notes in the first six measures can be appropriately extended, and attention should be paid to the changes in the intensity of the sound. The last four measures should grasp the bouncing characteristics of the melody and rhythm, with lively and cheerful expressions. The final two measures should be sung very loudly, firmly, and confidently. At the end of the first two verses, there is no need to slow down, and the final rest can be considered to be cancelled to tightly connect with the continuous mountain song rhythm at the beginning of the next verse. At the end of the third verse, you can gradually slow down and increase in intensity.

    大跃进颂
    田间词
    马可曲
    〔唱法说明〕这首歌适于独唱。唱时要求感情奔放，声音高亢嘹亮，如唱山歌。节奏及速度可按情绪需要自由处理。前六小节的长音可适当延长，并注意音势强弱的变化。后四小节掌握旋律与节奏跳荡的特点，表情活跃、欢愉。结束的二小节要唱得十分响亮、坚定、自信。前两段结束时不必渐慢，并可考虑将最后的休止符取消以与下一段开始的绵延的山歌节奏紧紧衔接，第三段结束时可渐慢渐强。
