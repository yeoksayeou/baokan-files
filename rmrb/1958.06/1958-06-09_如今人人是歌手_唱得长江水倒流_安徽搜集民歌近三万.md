Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: In just over a month, Anhui Province has collected nearly 30,000 folk songs and ballads. The first and second collections of "Great Leap Forward Folk Songs" have already been published; a sample of the first collection of "Singing of the New Countryside" has also been printed and will soon be released. The vigorous collection and compilation is continuing in various places.

"Don't say the Milky Way in the nine heavens is beautiful, don't complain that dry land yields are low, the commune opened a channel, leading the Milky Way water to irrigate the land." "Leap forward red flowers bloom in the heart, opening the mouth, the fragrance sprays out, songs resound from all corners of the country, singing out a spring." The people of Anhui Province, in the midst of the booming production upsurge, expressed their heartfelt feelings in moving poems and sang the praises of their heroic labor.

Since last winter, the number of folk songs appearing in Anhui Province is as stated in one folk song: "Now singing is done with baskets, thousands upon thousands of baskets fill the warehouse, don't think it's just talk, scatter it in the fields and it turns into rice. Farming requires a good hoe, singing requires a good singer, now everyone is a singer, singing makes the Yangtze River flow backwards." These folk songs have played an immeasurable role in encouraging the masses in their struggle with nature.

In order to collect these great poems, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on collecting folk songs in early April. Party committees at all levels attached great importance to this and immediately organized cultural departments at all levels and tens of thousands of rural cultural centers and stations to carry out collection work. Some cultural and entertainment cadres even climbed mountains and crossed ridges, going deep into remote mountain areas and fields, to conduct interviews and record songs.

### 如今人人是歌手　唱得长江水倒流  安徽搜集民歌近三万

　　如今人人是歌手　唱得长江水倒流
    安徽搜集民歌近三万
    新华社合肥讯　安徽省一个多月来已搜集民歌民谣近三万首。“大跃进民歌”选集第一、第二两集已经出版；“歌唱新农村”第一集样本也已印出，不久即将发行。现在各地仍在继续大力搜集和编选。
    “别说九天银河美，别怨旱地产量低，社里开了一道渠，引来银河水浇地。”“跃进红花心里开，张口花香喷出来，山南海北齐歌唱，唱出一个春天来。”安徽省人民群众在轰轰烈烈的生产高潮中，用动人的诗篇表达了自己的心声，歌颂了自己的英雄劳动。
    去冬以来，安徽省出现民歌之多，正如一首民歌中所唱的一样：“如今歌唱用箩装，千箩万箩堆满仓，别看那是口头语，撒到田里变米粮。种田要用好锄头，唱歌要有好歌手，如今歌手人人是，唱得长江水倒流。”这些民歌在群众向大自然的斗争中，起了无可估量的鼓舞作用。
    为了把这些伟大的诗篇搜集起来，中共安徽省委在4月初发出搜集民歌的通知。各级党委非常重视，立即组织各级文化部门和数万个农村文化馆、站进行搜集工作，有些文娱干部还爬山越岭，深入到偏僻的山区和田间，进行访问和纪录。
