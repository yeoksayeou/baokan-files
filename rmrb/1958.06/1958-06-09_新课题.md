    In the process of realizing the technological revolution, and in the process of the great development of local industry, various provinces and regions will successively see the emergence of many new industrial cities and industrial bases. During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, thousands of such "points" will appear. Building these new "points" not only requires raising funds, investigating resources, overall planning, and deciding which factories to equip; but also, before starting the design, arranging the locations of these factories one by one: you here, he there, the factory here, the dormitory there, arranging things so that things several factories can share, like boilers, tap water, dedicated railway lines, etc., are convenient to share, so that less farmland is occupied, so that welfare facilities and civil buildings can be not newly built or less built... In short, to build this new industrial city, this new base, very properly and reasonably. This work is called "industrial zone planning." In the past, this work was presided over by the relevant ministries and commissions of the central government. In the future, with the decentralization of enterprises managed by the central government and the development of local industry, this burden will mainly be borne by the localities. This work, which requires consideration of both politics and economics and is also highly technical, is a new topic for local party and government organs. Failure to pay attention to this new topic and failure to lead this work will result in waste and long-term unreasonableness in the construction of new industrial cities.
    This is a new job. However, as long as you start to grasp it, you will find that it is not very difficult. Liuzhou, Guangxi, provides valuable experience in this new work. The main points of this experience are still: party committee leadership, putting politics in command, first being abstract, then being practical, promoting democracy, engaging in great debate and calculation. In this way, it is possible to overcome departmentalism and local viewpoints that only start from individual enterprises, accelerate the speed of planning, and prevent waste.
    As local industrial production and construction gradually deepen, new topics will emerge more and more. In order to strive for initiative in our work, and to strive for building more, faster, better, and more economically, we must seize these new topics in a timely manner, delve into them, and solve them. In this process, our construction skills will become greater and greater.

　　新课题
　　孔桑
    在实现技术革命的过程中，在地方工业大发展的过程中，各个省区都将陆续出现不少新的工业城市和工业基地。在第二个五年计划期间，这样的“点”将会出现成千个。建设这些新的“点”，不仅要筹措资金，调查资源，统筹安排，决定配备哪些工厂；而且要在动手设计之前，把这些工厂的位置一个个安排好：你在这里，他在那里，工厂在这里，宿舍在那里，安排得使几个工厂能够共用的东西，像锅炉、自来水、铁路专用线等等，便于共用，使农田可以少占，使福利设施、民用建筑可以不新建或少建……。总之，要把这个新工业城市、新基地建设得十分妥贴、合理。这个工作，就叫做“工业区规划”。这件工作，过去都是由中央有关的部委主持来作的。今后，随着中央所管企业的下放和地方工业的发展，这个担子主要要由地方来承担了。这个既要考虑政治、经济，又带有很大技术性的工作，对于地方党政机关来说，是一个新的课题。不注意这个新课题，不把这件工作领导起来，就会在新工业城市的建设上造成浪费和长期的不合理。
    这是一件新工作。但是，只要动手去抓它，那么，就会发现它也不是很困难的。广西柳州在这件新工作上提供了值得参考的经验。这个经验的主要之点仍然是：党委领导，政治挂帅，先务虚，后务实，发扬民主，大争大辩算大账。这样，就能够克服只从各个企业出发的本位主义、局部观点，加快规划的速度，防止浪费。
    随着地方工业生产建设的逐步深入，新的课题将越来越多。为了争取工作上的主动，争取建设得多快好省，就要及时抓住这些新课题，钻进去，解决它。在这个过程中，我们建设的本领也就越来越大了。
