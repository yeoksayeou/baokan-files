Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: According to TASS, New York, June 28th, some American newspapers are expressing disappointment at the repeated failures of the United States to launch artificial earth satellites and its backwardness in space research. At the same time, they are emphasizing the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union.

The "New York Times," in an editorial, wrote that the fifth failure of the United States to launch the "Vanguard" satellite "once again clearly shows that we are far behind the Soviet Union." The newspaper pointed out that eight months have passed since the Soviet Union's first satellite entered orbit, and the Soviet Union has already sent three satellites into orbit, each larger than the last, while the United States has not been able to send a satellite into orbit that is even close in size to the Soviet Union's first satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: London dispatch: A turbine at the Calder Hall nuclear power station in Britain exploded on the evening of the 28th, forcing the power station to shut down.

According to reports, the turbine was destroyed by a fire, and the roof of the building housing the turbine was burned. The flames went through the roof, and were extinguished only after firefighters sprayed a large amount of water. The room was full of fragments of machinery.

The British Atomic Energy Authority later said: "The cause of the accident is still unknown, but it may have been caused by a valve blockage."

The Calder Hall nuclear power station was built and began generating electricity in 1956. Last October, a nuclear reactor at the power station also had an accident, during which radioactive dust was scattered in the nearby countryside.

    远远落在苏联后面
    美报刊对美国卫星屡次失败表示失望
    英原子能发电站又发生事故陷于停顿
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：美国一些报刊对于美国发射人造地球卫星一再失败并且在宇宙空间研究方面的落后情况，表示失望。同时，它们还强调指出了苏联的巨大成就。
    “纽约时报”在编辑部的文章中写道，美国发射“先锋号”卫星的第五次失败“再次明显地表明我们远远落在苏联的后面”。报纸指出，苏联第一个卫星进入轨道离现在已经有八个月了，苏联已经把三个卫星送上了轨道，卫星的尺寸一个比一个大，而美国就没有能够把尺寸同苏联第一个卫星相近的卫星送上轨道。
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英国考尔德豪尔原子能发电站的一座涡轮机在28日晚上发生爆炸，迫使这个原子能发电站的工作陷于停顿。
    据报道，涡轮机因起火炸毁，设置涡轮机的建筑的屋顶被烧毁，火焰穿过屋顶，经过救火队喷灌大量水之后才告熄灭。屋子里满处是机器的碎片。
    据英国原子能委员会事后说：“发生事故的原因还不知道，可能是由于汽门堵塞所致。”
    考尔德豪尔原子能发电站是1956年建成和发电的。去年10月发电站的一个原子能反应堆也发生过事故，当时放射性微尘曾散落到附近的乡村。
