Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd: The method of using small machine tools to process large workpieces currently being adopted by Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 has aroused great interest among the representatives from various regions attending the National Rolling Steel Production Promotion Conference in Shanghai, changing the old view that only large equipment can manufacture rolling mills.

The method of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is to stand the large workpiece—the large frame of a sheet metal machine—on the ground and use several modified small machine tools to cut around it. The newly built sheet metal workshop of this factory needed more than a dozen large frames, each weighing 27 tons. Only one shipyard in Shanghai had a large machine tool that could process them, and it could not meet the demand. All the machine tools in Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 would be crushed if a large frame was placed on them, let alone processing them. In this situation, a group of worker-turned-deputy chief mechanical engineers, section chiefs, and veteran workers at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 collectively created this clever method of breaking the conventional machine tool processing method (processing the workpiece on the machine tool).

In the temporary bamboo shed set up in the open space of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, people can see this processing scene. The upper half of a small shaper is installed on the bed of a lathe, cutting towards the huge workpiece standing on the ground while moving forward. The tool holder of another small shaper is installed on the frame of a gantry planer, cutting back and forth close to the workpiece. Even more ingenious is that the boring row, gears, and other mechanisms of the boring machine are simply installed in the gaps in the middle of the workpiece like an inlay to work. These machine tools have changed their original shapes, and the workpiece is much larger and heavier than them. They surround the huge frame, some nibbling upwards, some biting on the side, and some drilling inside to peel off the skin.

The representatives from various regions believe that this has opened the door for China to use small machine tools to process large workpieces, and solved a major difficulty for the domestic self-manufacture of rolling mills.

Comrades from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry said: This is an important development in machine tool processing methods. He said that with the development of industry, the workpieces being processed are always getting bigger and bigger, and the manufacture of heavy-duty machine tools can never keep up with the demand. Therefore, this method of using small machine tools to process large workpieces is very valuable to promote.

### 机床加工方法的重要发展  上钢三厂用小机床做大活

    机床加工方法的重要发展
    上钢三厂用小机床做大活
    新华社上海23日电  上海第三钢铁厂正在采用的用小机床加工大工作物的办法，引起了在上海参加全国轧钢生产促进会议的各地代表很大兴趣，改变了人们认为只有大设备才能制造轧钢机的旧观点。
    上钢三厂的办法是把大工作物——薄板机的大机架立在地上不动，用几台改装过的小机床围绕着它进行切削。这个厂新建的薄板车间需要十几只大机架，这种机架每只重达二十七吨，全上海只有一家船厂的一台大机床可以加工，不能满足需要；上钢三厂的所有机床，不要说加工，大机架一放上去就会把机床压垮。在这种情况下，上钢三厂一批工人出身的副总机械师、工段长、老工人们，集体创造了这个打破机床加工常规（工作物放在机床上加工）的巧办法。
    在上钢三厂空地上临时搭起的竹棚里，人们可以见到这种加工的情景。小牛头刨床的上半截安装在车床的台面上，一边向立在地上不动的庞大工作物进行切削，一面向前移动。另一台小牛头刨床的刀架，安装在龙门刨床的机架上，紧傍着工作物往返切削。更妙的是镗床的镗排、齿轮等机械，就像一种镶嵌物一样，干脆安装在工作物中间的空隙中进行工作。这些机床已经改变了原来的形状，工作物比它们要大得多、重得多。它们围绕着巨大的机架，有的向上啃，有的在旁边咬，有的钻在里面去剥皮。
    各地的代表们认为：这为我国用小机床加工大工作物打开了大门，为国内自制轧钢机解决了一个大困难。
    冶金工业部的同志说：这是机床加工方法的一个重要发展。他说，随着工业的发展，加工的工作物总是越来越大，重型机床的制造总是赶不上需要的。因此这种采用小机床加工大工作物的办法很有推广价值。
