Xinhua News Agency report: Encouraged by the general line of socialist construction, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Mishan Railway Soldier Reclamation Bureau of Heilongjiang Province have put forward the goal of developing and building the frontier without state investment. The reporter learned from the Ministry of Reclamation that these two reclamation areas have decided that in the last four years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Xinjiang Production Corps will expand reclamation by more than 10 million mu, and the Mishan Reclamation Bureau will expand reclamation by more than 8 million mu. The construction of general industry, agriculture, and cultural and educational undertakings in the reclamation area will not require state investment. They will work with the people of the whole country to quickly, efficiently, and economically reclaim the Xinjiang region and the Great Northern Wilderness of Heilongjiang Province into new high-yield grain and cotton bases for the motherland.

The specific plans for the production and construction army in the two reclamation areas are as follows: During the Second Five-Year Plan period, each will reclaim 15 million mu of wasteland. At the same time, drainage and irrigation projects for all cultivated land will be built in the reclamation areas. Along with the land reclamation, livestock and forestry will be greatly developed using natural grasslands, and various agricultural and livestock product processing plants, wood processing plants, fertilizer plants, and institutions of higher learning to train various talents for industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry will be built and developed to match the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. Starting next year, the construction funds for land reclamation, animal husbandry, industry, and cultural and educational undertakings in the above-mentioned reclamation areas will not require a single penny of state funds, and will all be handled by the reclamation areas themselves through their own strength and production accumulation.

The implementation of the construction plans of these two reclamation areas will greatly change the face of these regions. At that time, the sparsely populated or uninhabited ancient wilderness will become China's high-yield grain and cotton bases and regions rich in livestock products, woven goods, and timber.

The officers and soldiers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Mishan Railway Soldier Reclamation Bureau have launched a high tide of developing agricultural, sideline, and animal husbandry production and a friendship competition. The leaders of the two regions have negotiated the conditions for the competition in Beijing: starting next year, in the case of no state investment, they will compete on who reclaims more wasteland, the industrial construction is faster, the output per unit area is higher, and the reclamation area is better built. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has participated in the construction and transportation of railways, highways, and other border projects in the Xinjiang region to accumulate funds for the development of agricultural reclamation, animal husbandry, and industrial construction. The Mishan Railway Soldier Reclamation Bureau is also carrying out diversified operations on a large scale to accumulate funds for the construction of the frontier. The slogan put forward by Mishan is: Use our own production to build the Great Northern Wilderness.

In order to realize this grand ambition, the vast number of officers and soldiers in the two places are working hard to fight this year's production battle. The agricultural units of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have increased the original plan of reclaiming 1.5 million mu this year to 5 million mu without increasing investment. This number exceeds their reclamation area of more than 1 million mu in the past eight years. They have completed the sowing of the 3.2 million mu of cultivated land that they have reclaimed in the past, and have launched a high tide of competition for high yields of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu and 14,000 lambs per 10,000 sheep. The reclamation plan of the Mishan Railway Soldier Reclamation Bureau this year has also leaped to more than 6 million mu, which is equal to twice the existing cultivated area. In order to complete 70% of the reclamation targets before July 1, they are currently plowing the Great Northern Wilderness day and night.

Since the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps undertook the task of building and developing the Xinjiang region in 1950, it has overcome the unique hardships of the border areas. It used clumsy "earth cutting hoes" to reclaim land, sheltered from wind and rain in dugouts, saved money on food and clothing, and finally built reservoirs and irrigation networks on the barren land with saline-alkali and little rain, reclaimed more than 3 million mu of wasteland, and built 58 state-owned mechanized farms. In the past eight years, they have produced a total of 1.2 billion jin of grain and nearly 800,000 dan of cotton for the country, creating the highest national yield records for cotton, corn, and wheat. During the same period, they also bred a large number of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep and hybrid sheep, which not only laid the foundation for the development of animal husbandry in the region, but also supplied Inner Mongolia, the Northeast, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangxi and other places to help fraternal regions develop animal husbandry. The officers and soldiers of the Mishan Railway Soldier Reclamation Bureau have also overcome the unique difficulties of the Great Northern Wilderness, such as cold weather and swampy land. Since 1955, they have reclaimed nearly 3 million mu of wasteland and established 15 state-owned mechanized farms, laying the foundation for large-scale reclamation of the Great Northern Wilderness.

Xinhua News Agency report: This year, the agricultural reclamation system will reclaim and build a large number of new mechanized state-owned farms.

This year, the national agricultural reclamation system plans to reclaim 20 million mu. A small part of the newly reclaimed land will be used to expand the cultivated area of the original 700-plus farms, and most of it will be used to build more than 500 new farms in the way of old farms leading new farms and large farms leading small farms. These new farms are mostly established in remote areas with more wasteland such as Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and South China. There are also many new farms established in the lakeside wasteland areas of the interior.

Xinhua News Agency report: State-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province are training tractor drivers for agricultural production cooperatives in the province.

At present, more than 80 state-owned farms in the province and the farms under the Mishan Reclamation Bureau are training tractor drivers for agricultural cooperatives. This batch of more than 4,300 trainees are all young farmers selected by agricultural cooperatives with high awareness, good health, several years of agricultural production labor experience, and a junior high school education level. They participate in the farm's production labor, operate practically, learn and work at the same time, and can become second- or third-level drivers after one year.

In order to basically realize agricultural mechanization during the Second Five-Year Plan period, Heilongjiang Province has begun to systematically train a large number of tractor drivers and agricultural implement operators for agricultural cooperatives. In addition to farm training, the Mudanjiang area has also opened short-term training classes and is training more than 300 demobilized soldiers who can drive tanks and cars.

    不用国家投资建设边疆
    新疆兵团和密山农垦局决定依靠自己力量建设粮棉高产基地
    今年全国将新建五百多个机械化农场
    据新华社讯　在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，新疆生产建设兵团、黑龙江省密山铁道兵农垦局提出了不要国家投资开发和建设边疆的奋斗目标。记者从农垦部获悉：这两个垦区已经决定在第二个五年计划时期的后四年，新疆生产兵团扩大开荒一千多万亩，密山农垦局扩大开荒八百万多亩，垦区的一般工业、农业和文教事业的建设，都不要国家的投资。他们要和全国人民一起，多快好省地把新疆地区和黑龙江省的北大荒开垦成为祖国新的高产的粮食、棉花基地。
    两个垦区的生产建设大军，今后建设的具体计划是：在第二个五年计划期间各开垦荒地一千五百万亩，同时要在垦区修筑起所有耕地的排水、灌溉工程。和垦荒事业并进的是利用天然草原大量发展畜牧业、林业，还要建设和发展与农业、牧业、林业生产相适应的各种农畜产品加工厂、木材加工厂、化肥厂，以及举办为工业、农业、畜牧业培养各种人才的高等学校。上述垦区的开荒、畜牧、工业和文教事业的建设资金，从明年起再不要国家一文资金，全部依靠各垦区自己的力量和生产积累来办。
    这两个垦区建设计划的实现，将使这些地区的面貌大为改观。那时，人烟稀少或无人烟的古老荒原上，将变成我国高产的粮食、棉花基地和盛产畜牧品、织料品和木材的地区。
    新疆生产建设兵团和密山铁道兵农垦局的全体官兵已经掀起了发展农业、副业、畜牧业生产高潮和友谊竞赛。两个地区的领导人已经在北京商妥了竞赛条件：从明年开始在不要国家投资的情况下比谁开荒多，工业建设的快，单位面积产量高，垦区建设的好。新疆生产建设兵团已经参加了新疆地区的铁路、公路等边疆建设和运输等工作，为发展农垦、畜牧和工业等建设事业积累资金。密山铁道兵农垦局也在大量开展多种经营，为建设边疆积累资金。密山提出的口号是：用自己生产的东西建设北大荒。
    为实现这一宏愿，两地的广大官兵，正干劲十足的要打好今年的生产仗。新疆生产建设兵团的农业部队，在不增加投资的情况下，把原订今年垦荒一百五十万亩的计划增加到五百万亩，这个数字超过了他们过去八年的垦荒面积一百多万亩。他们已经完成了过去开垦的三百二十万亩耕地的播种工作，掀起了亩产千斤籽棉、万羊产一万四千只羊羔的丰产竞赛热潮。密山铁道兵农垦局今年的开荒计划也跃进到六百多万亩，等于现有耕地面积的一倍。他们为了在7月1日以前完成70％的垦荒指标，目前他们正在日夜不停的翻耕着北大荒。
    新疆生产建设兵团自1950年担负建设开发新疆地区的任务以来，克服了边疆地区特有的艰难辛苦，曾用笨重的“砍土镘”开荒，在地窝里避风雨，省穿节用，终于在盐碱少雨的荒野上，兴修了水库和灌溉网，开垦出三百多万亩荒地，建成了五十八个国营机械化农场。八年来，他们共为国家生产了十二亿斤粮食和近八十万担棉花，创造了棉花、玉米、小麦的全国最高丰产纪录。在同一时期里，他们还繁殖了大批新疆细毛羊和杂交羊，不仅奠定了本地区发展畜牧业的基础，还供应内蒙古、东北、贵州、云南、江西等地，帮助兄弟地区发展畜牧业。密山铁道兵农垦局的官兵们也克服了北大荒特有的寒冷和沼泽地的困难，从1955年以来，开垦了近三百万亩荒地，建立了十五个国营机械农场，为大规模的开垦北大荒建立了基础。
    据新华社讯　农垦系统今年将开荒新建大批新的机械化的国营农场。
    今年全国农垦系统开荒计划是二千万亩，新垦荒地的小部分用以扩大原有七百多个农场的耕地面积，大部分将以老场带新场、大场带小场的办法新建五百多个新农场。这些新农场多建立在荒原较多的新疆、黑龙江、华南等边远地区，内地的滨湖荒区亦有不少新的农场建立。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省国营农场正在为本省的农业生产合作社训练拖拉机手。
    目前全省八十多个国营农场和密山农垦局所属各农场都在为农业社训练拖拉机手。这一批训练的四千三百多名，都是农业社选派的觉悟高、身体健康的、经过几年农业生产劳动并有高小或初中文化水平的青年农民。他们参加农场的生产劳动，实际操作，边学边作，一年之后就可以成为二、三级驾驶员。
    黑龙江省为了在第二个五年计划期间基本实现农业机械化，已开始有计划地为农业社培养大量拖拉机手和农具手。除农场训练以外，牡丹江专区还开办了短期训练班，正在训练三百多名会驾驶坦克、汽车的转业军人。
