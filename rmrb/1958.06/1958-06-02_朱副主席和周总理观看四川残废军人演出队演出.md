　　After the performance, Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, Xu Teli, Xie Juezai, and others went on stage to congratulate the disabled veterans on their performance. Premier Zhou and others greeted the disabled veterans one by one, asking about their injuries and current living conditions. When Premier Zhou saw Zhang Jiachen, a disabled veteran who had lost both hands, he cordially said to him, "You are truly multi-talented." Zhang Jiachen performed a harmonium solo, recited the poem "Our Hearts Are Forever Loyal to the Party," and danced a Qinghai folk dance today. The Premier said, "The poem 'Our Hearts Are Forever Loyal to the Party' that you recited just now is very moving. We want the newspaper to publish this poem."

Du Shuangquan clasped the Premier's hand tightly and said, "On the Korean battlefield." The Premier repeatedly praised him, saying, "You sing well. You are a hero." When the disabled veterans saw Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, and others, they all scrambled to shake hands, and some even embraced Premier Zhou. One disabled veteran excitedly shouted, "We thank the Party for its care and cultivation!" Premier Zhou replied, "You are the people's soldiers, the people's artists, and you should be cared for by the Party and respected by the masses."

　　More than a thousand people attended today. They were all moved by the disabled veterans' wonderful performance and continuously applauded enthusiastically, praising their revolutionary optimism.
