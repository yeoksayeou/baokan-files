    Continuously Creates Twenty Kinds of Machines

    (Reported by this newspaper) Song Xishan, a fitter at the JiaoZuo Coal Mine Basic Construction Repair Factory, has recently created twenty kinds of machines and tools in succession, enabling him to complete forty years' worth of work in one year. The "Multi-Purpose Electric Punch Press" and "Screw-Turning Machine" he created have transformed many heavy manual operations in the fitter's workshop into mechanized production, increasing labor efficiency by 40 to 110 times.
