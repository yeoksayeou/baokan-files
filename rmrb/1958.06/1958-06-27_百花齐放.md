    Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    97　The hollyhock's flower stalks shoot straight up, and the viburnum flowers bloom one after another, from bottom to top, shooting straight without leaning, one after another in order. We want to be flower models that are more, faster, better, and more economical, and we want to be a ladder to the blue sky striving to move upwards. Surpassing England and catching up with the United States is not surprising; not only do the 600 million people have this ambition, but all the myriad flowers also obey the Party's command. How glorious it is that the flowers bloom during the "July 1st" festive season!

    98　Gardenia. Gardenias bloom in the transition between spring and summer. Our flowering period is long, and our fragrance is strong. Our flower color is pure white, later turning yellow, and the fruit can be used as dye, medicine, and food. Han Yu's line, "Banana leaves are large, gardenias are plump," (note) uses the word "plump" to show his deliberation; the petals are thick, and the leaves and stems have no hairs. Planted in the garden, it is best matched with clusters of banana trees.
  (Note) See Han Yu's poem "Mountain Stone".

    99　Winter Sweet. It is no longer surprising that winter sweet blooms in winter; mastering the laws of nature can change the flowering period. Haven't short-day chrysanthemums already bloomed in spring? We believe that winter sweet can also bloom in summer. We hope to participate in "May 1st" and "June 1st", and also hope to catch up with "July 1st", "August 1st", and "October 1st" to offer gifts. Gardeners, scientists, please try it and let us bloom at the same time as lotus and osmanthus.

    100　Plum Blossom. In the old days, we were called the leader among flowers, saying that we bloom before all other flowers and are uniquely blessed. Experiencing adversity is artificial, so why not winter, spring, summer, and autumn? After all, who comes first and who comes after, time is a continuous flow. Today, we will never haggle over this kind of personal vanity. The so-called icy muscles and jade bones are already stale and stuffy. We want to plant the red flag on the top of the world. The question is: to earnestly fulfill our responsibilities.

  101　All Other Flowers. Old-fashioned poems say, "Flowers that understand speech cause more trouble," (note) and today we have all become flowers that cause trouble. A hundred flower big-character posters are feared to be too many, but we only exert ourselves fully and don't want to say more. There are several mentions of poets in the big-character posters, because it is necessary to pay attention to criticism and self-criticism. We hope that both new and old poets will not be sensitive; we should strive to move upwards and continuously revolutionize.
  (Note) "Flowers that understand speech cause more trouble, stones that cannot speak are the most lovable" is a line from Lu Fangweng's poem.

    Postscript
    "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" was written in 101 poems. (Note 1)
    Generally speaking, "a hundred flowers" includes all flowers. If only a hundred kinds of flowers are selected to be written about, then there are only a hundred kinds of flowers, and it does not include other flowers. In this way, the meaning of "a hundred flowers" has changed.
    Therefore, I wrote an extra poem, "All Other Flowers," as the 101st poem.
    I rather like the number 101, because it seems to symbolize a new beginning, a renewal of all things. There is a "already crossed, not yet crossed" flavor here, finished yet not finished. (Note 2) "Going one step further from the top of a hundred-foot pole" means continuous revolution.
    Writing these poems officially started on March 30th. In 1956, I wrote three poems (Peony,芍药, Spring Orchid). Apart from these, it took a total of ten days. Thanks to the east wind of the Great Leap Forward in national production, this east wind blows, and a hundred flowers bloom.
    In the writing process, I am grateful to many friends for their help. Some lent me books and paintings, some wrote letters to me, and some sent me flower specimens or seeds. I also visited the horticulture departments of the Temple of Heaven, Zhongshan Park, and Beihai Park. I went to all the flower shops in Beijing to ask for advice. I would like to express my gratitude to them here.
    Of course, I want to especially mention the encouragement of the comrades of the "People's Daily" editorial department. I would also like to thank them for mobilizing many comrades to make illustrations.
    I would also like to thank all friends—those who copied, typeset, proofread, read... all friends.
    I would also like to thank all the flowers. I have recorded their statements, but I am afraid that the recording is not very accurate. Forgive me, flower comrades, please allow me to gradually polish them carefully in the future. April 9, 1958, morning
    (Note 1) After the postscript was written, I checked the catalog and actually wrote 104 poems. I removed three poems: Tung Oil Flower, Pearl Orchid, and Royal Water Lily. In this way, they are also included in "All Other Flowers".
    (Note 2) "Already Crossed, Not Yet Crossed" are two hexagrams in the Book of Changes. The Book of Changes ends with these two hexagrams, meaning that the change of all things is a spiral progression, one link after another, finished yet not finished, never finished.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    97　蜀葵花箭茎条条直射，琼花朵朵相继，由下而上，直射不倚，相继有序。我们要做多快好省的花模范，我们要做力争上游的青云梯。超过英国，赶上美国，不算希奇，不仅六亿人民都有这种志气，万花万汇也都服从党的指挥；多么光荣呵，花开在“七一”佳期！
    98　栀子花栀子开花的时节在春夏之交，我们的花期长，我们的香气高。我们的花色纯白，其后变为黄，果实可以作为染料、药料、食料。韩愈的诗句“芭蕉叶大栀子肥”，（注）用上一个“肥”字显出他的推敲；花瓣肉厚，叶和梗全都没有毛。种在庭园里，最宜配上簇芭蕉。
  （注）见韩愈“山石”一诗。
    99　腊梅花在冬天开花已经不算甚么希奇，掌握了自然规律可以改变花期。不是已经有短日照菊开在春天？我们相信腊梅也可以开在夏季。我们希望能够参加“五一”和“六一”，也希望赶上“七一”、“八一”、“十一”献礼。园艺家们，科学家们，请你们试一试，让我们能够与荷花、桂花开放同时。
    100　梅　花在旧时代我们被称为花中魁首，说我们开在百花之先得天独厚，历朔是人为的，何妨是冬春夏秋？到底谁先谁后，时间是不断之流。在今天决不计较这种个人虚名，所谓冰肌玉骨已经陈腐得熏人。我们要把红旗插上世界的屋顶，问题是：要认真尽到自己的责任。
  101　其他一切的花旧式的诗句：“花如解语还多事”，（注）咱们今天都成为了多事的花。一百张花的大字报怕人嫌多，咱们只鼓足干劲，不想再多话。大字报中有好几处提到了诗人，因为要重视批评和自我批评；希望新旧诗人们都不要多心，我们应该力争上游，不断革命。
  （注）“花如解语还多事，石不能言最可人”，是陆放翁的诗句。
    后记
    “百花齐放”写了101首。（注一）
    普通说“百花”是包含一切的花。只选出一百种花来写，那就只有一百种花，而不包含其他的花。这样，“百花”的含义就变了。
    因此，我就格外写了一首“其他一切的花”，作为第101首。
    我倒有点喜欢101这个数字，因为它似乎象征着一元复始，万象更新。这里有“既济、未济”的味道，完了又没有完。（注二）“百尺竿头更进一步”，这就意味着不断革命。
    写这些诗是3月30日正式开始的。1956年做过三首（牡丹、芍药、春兰），除此之外，一共费了十天工夫。感谢全国生产大跃进的东风，这东风一吹，便使百花齐放了。
    在写作中，感谢很多朋友帮了我的忙。有的借书画给我，有的写信给我，还有的送给我花的标本或者种籽。我还到天坛、中山公园、北海公园的园艺部去访问过。北京市内卖花的地方，我都去请过教。我在这里向他们表示谢意。
    当然，我要特别提到“人民日报”编辑部同志们的鼓舞。我还要感谢他们动员了好些同志作插图。
    我也要感谢一切的朋友——抄写、排印、校对、阅读……一切的朋友。
    我也要感谢一切的花。他们的发言，我作了记录，恐怕记录得不大正确。原谅吧，百花同志，请让我日后再逐步仔细打磨。　1958年4月9日晨
    （注一）后记写好后，查了一下目录，实际上写了104首。我把油桐花、真珠兰和王莲三首抽掉了。这样，他们也就被包含在“其他一切的花”中。
    （注二）“既济、未济”是易经六十四卦中的二卦。易经是以这两卦结尾的，意味着万事万物的变易是螺旋式进展，一环接着一环，完了又没有完，永远完不了。
