Comrade Kim Il Sung spoke at the meeting.

Moon Man-wook said that after the war, the Korean Workers' Party consistently implemented the economic policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry while rapidly developing light industry and agriculture, and restored and constructed many light industrial factories such as the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the Chongjin Artificial Fiber Factory, the Ryongsong Meat Processing Factory, the Pyongyang Daily Necessities General Factory, and the Pyongyang Wood Furniture Factory; and established a light industrial base in northern Korea where there was none in the past.

In his report, Moon Man-wook put forward specific measures to improve and strengthen food processing and the production of daily necessities.

The output of vegetable oil could also reach 35,000 tons.

Moon Man-wook also said that it is necessary to expand the variety of daily necessities and expand production. He said that in addition to the Ministry of Light Industry, local enterprises, handicraft production cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, and families should also widely participate in the production of daily necessities.
