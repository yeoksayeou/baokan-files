    Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: According to Kyodo News, cabinet members of the Kishi Nobusuke administration stated at a banquet held on the 21st for three monopoly capital organizations including the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations that for Japan, which lost its huge investments in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Korea before the war, it is necessary to expand exports abroad through methods such as "economic cooperation" and "providing long-term credit," even at considerable risk in the future. Cabinet members of the Kishi Nobusuke administration also expressed particular desire for the Southeast Asian market.

    This statement by the Kishi Nobusuke government once again exposes its ambition to carry out economic expansion abroad, especially in the Southeast Asian region.

    Based on the fact that Southeast Asian countries need to import construction equipment but lack foreign exchange, Japanese monopoly capital groups are attempting to massively invade the Southeast Asian market by using methods such as deferred payment exports and providing credit. According to the "Nikkei Economic News," in the face of fierce competition with countries such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany, the Kishi Nobusuke government recently lowered the conditions for deferred payment exports, reducing the original requirement of paying off loans within five years and a first payment of 25% or more to paying off loans within seven years and a first payment of 20% or more. This newspaper revealed that in order to compete with countries such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany in the Southeast Asian region, Japan is keeping some of its methods for strengthening exports to this region strictly secret.

    However, this approach by the Kishi Nobusuke government is not proceeding smoothly. According to the "Nikkei Economic News," the Indian government recently announced a decision to completely ban the import of textile machinery. In this case, the transaction reached last November between the Indian and Japanese Textile Machinery Associations, in which India would purchase 250,000 Japanese-made spindles using installment payments over five years, can no longer be completed. The value of this transaction is 2.5 billion yen, accounting for half of Japan's planned total export value of textile machinery to India this year.

### 岸信介政府用延期付款等办法  向东南亚进行经济扩张

    岸信介政府用延期付款等办法
    向东南亚进行经济扩张
    新华社24日讯　据共同社报道：岸信介内阁的阁员在21日举行的一次宴会上向日本经济团体联合会等三个垄断资本组织表示：对丧失了战前在中国的东北、台湾和朝鲜的巨额投资的日本来说，今后即使冒着相当危险，也必须用“经济合作”和“提供长期信贷”等办法向国外扩大输出。岸信介内阁的阁员还特别表示了对东南亚市场的垂涎。
    岸信介政府的这一表示，再度暴露了它企图对外，特别是对东南亚地区进行经济扩张的野心。
    日本垄断资本集团根据东南亚国家需要进口建设器材但是缺乏外汇的这一情况，正在用延期付款输出和提供信贷等办法，企图大举侵入东南亚市场。据“日本经济新闻”报道，在同美、英、西德等国家进行激烈竞争的情况下，岸信介政府最近降低了延期付款的输出条件，把原来规定的五年内付清贷款和第一批付款25％以上的条件降低为七年内付清贷款和第一批付款20％以上。这家报纸透露，为了在东南亚地区同美、英、西德等国家竞争，日本对它向这个地区加强输出的一些办法严加保守秘密。
    但是，岸信介政府的这种做法进行得并不顺利。据“日本经济新闻”报道，印度政府最近发表了关于全面禁止输入纺织机器的决定。在这种情况下，去年11月印度和日本纤维机器协会达成的关于五年内印度用分期付款办法购买二十五万枚日本制纺缍的交易已经不能成交。这笔交易的价款达二十五亿日元，占日本今年度计划向印度输出纺织机器总价款的一半。
