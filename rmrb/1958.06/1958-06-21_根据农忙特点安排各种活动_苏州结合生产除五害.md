    Suzhou Combines Production with the Elimination of the Five Pests
    (Our newspaper reports) Suzhou region has always had a clear understanding of the spirit of combining production with the elimination of the five pests. As the busy season of spring plowing and summer harvesting and planting arrived, the experience of combining manure accumulation to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions was promptly promoted. A system of division of labor and responsibility was implemented, with animal breeders contracting to handle livestock manure, sanitation workers handling human waste, "five guarantee" households managing chamber pots well, agricultural technicians contracting to eliminate mosquito larvae in ditches and ponds around houses, women frequently catching rats, and children frequently catching and beating mosquitoes and flies, and removing bird nests. The Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seized every opportunity to rationally organize manpower and use agricultural gaps to launch surprise attacks on snails. In the treatment of schistosomiasis, it actively promoted methods beneficial to both patients and production, such as nighttime treatment and daytime production. After this meeting, the Suzhou Prefectural Committee made a preliminary plan to further create and promote good experiences, in addition to continuing to maintain the various regular methods of combining production as before. According to the laws of the agricultural production season, they want to better combine regular activities with blitz activities. For example, in the treatment of schistosomiasis, during the current month of the most intense summer harvesting and planting, efforts will be concentrated on treating the 100,000 late-stage patients in rural areas who cannot work and workers and students in urban areas. Universal testing will also be carried out on people in all schistosomiasis-endemic areas in the fifteen counties, registers of patients will be created, and treatment plans will be drawn up. As soon as there is a gap in agricultural work, time will be seized to treat adult patients. This will not only treat schistosomiasis but also avoid delaying production.

    根据农忙特点安排各种活动
    苏州结合生产除五害
    本报讯　苏州地区对结合生产开展除五害的精神，一直很明确。在春耕生产、夏收夏种忙季到来以后，即及时地推广结合积肥消灭蚊蝇孳生条件的经验。实行分工负责，饲养员包干处理牲畜粪便，清洁员处理人粪，五保户管理好马桶，农业技术员包干消灭宅边沟塘里孑孓，妇女经常捕鼠，儿童经常捕打蚊蝇、掏雀窠。中共苏州地委抓紧一切时机、合理组织人力，利用农隙突击灭螺；在治疗血吸虫病方面，积极推行夜间治疗白天生产等有利于病人、有利于生产的办法。经过这次会议，苏州地委初步计划，除去继续保持以前各种结合生产经常化的办法以外，还要进一步地创造和推广好的经验。根据农业生产季节的规律，他们要使经常化的活动和突击性活动结合得更好。如在治疗血吸虫病方面，在目前夏收夏种最紧张的这一个月期间，即集中力量对农村不能劳动的十万晚期病人和城镇的工人、学生患者进行治疗。并对十五个县所有血吸虫病流行地区的人进行普遍化验，造好病人名册，订出治疗计划，一到农事间隙，即抓紧时机对壮年病人进行治疗。这样做，既能治疗血吸虫病，又不耽误生产。
