　　Need More, Faster, Better, and Cheaper
    Tianjin State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1's Part-Work, Part-Study School Expands Enrollment
    (Our dispatch) The part-work, part-study school of the Tianjin State-Owned First Cotton Textile Factory, to meet the urgent needs of workers for cultural and technical advancement, continues to expand classes and add new ones. The new classes stipulate no limit on length of service; at the same time, they stipulate that workers participating in learning during work hours will not be paid for those two hours, so as to avoid increasing the burden on the state, and to earnestly implement the policy of cultivating the working class's intellectuals in a more, faster, better, and cheaper way.
    The new stipulation of not paying wages for the two hours spent learning during work hours has been welcomed by the workers. They believe that this is truly more, faster, better, and cheaper. If wages were still paid for the two hours not worked, it would increase the burden on the state, and would only be more, faster, and better, but not cheaper. Shuttle loader Han Xiaomei and Wang Tianlin rushed to sign up as soon as they saw the notice of expanded enrollment for the part-work, part-study school on the 6th. Han Xiaomei said, "It is reasonable not to pay wages for the two hours of study time. The Party is already being very good to us by letting us take two hours to study, how could we further increase the burden on the state?" Wang Tianlin did the math before signing up: his monthly salary is 59 yuan, and even with a deduction of more than ten yuan per month, it would be more than enough for his family of two. Weaving workers Chen Binglan and Wang Yuzhen also rushed to sign up. Wang Yuzhen's monthly salary is more than 81 yuan, and after participating in part-work, part-study, her monthly salary would be reduced by 20 yuan, but she said, "Because my family was poor, I couldn't afford to go to school when I was young, and I always envied others who could study. Now that life is better, and the Party has established part-work, part-study schools to cultivate us, we can't just look at the present, we should look to the future, and we would rather overcome a little difficulty ourselves than increase the burden on the state."
    On the 6th alone, more than 70 people from the entire factory signed up to participate in the part-work, part-study school.

　　要多快好也要省
    天津国棉一厂半工半读学校扩大招生
    本报讯　国营天津第一棉纺织厂半工半读学校适应工人的文化和技术大进军的迫切要求，继续扩大班次，增加新班。这个新班规定不限工龄；同时规定在工作时间参加学习的两小时不发工资，以免国家增加负担，切实贯彻执行多快好省的培养工人阶级知识分子的方针。
    在工作时间参加学习的两小时不发工资的新规定，受到了工人们的欢迎，他们认为这样才叫多快好省，如果两小时不工作还照发工资，给国家增加了负担，就只有多快好，而没有省了。装梭工韩小梅和王天林在6日刚一看到半工半读学校扩大招生的布告，就抢着报了名。韩小梅说：“两小时学习时间不发工资是合理的，党让我们抽出两小时来学习这已经很好了，难道我们还能再让国家增加负担吗？”王天林在报名以前就算了一下账：他每月工资五十九元，每月少发十多元，一家两口人也完全够用。织布女工陈秉兰和王玉珍也抢先报了名，王玉珍每月工资八十一元多，参加半工半读学习以后，每月就少发二十元的工资，但是她说：“我从小因为家穷就上不起学，总是羡慕别人能够读书，今天生活也好了，党又给我们设了半工半读学校培养我们，我们就不能光看眼前，应该往远看，宁可自己克服一点困难，也不能再给国家增加负担。”
    在6日这一天，全厂就有七十多人报名参加半工半读学校学习。
