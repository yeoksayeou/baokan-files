Why?

　　Sandbars at the Mouths of Large Rivers

    The existence of sandbars at the mouths of large rivers is not a geographical question, but a chemical one. Large rivers, having flowed across the continent for a long time, carry mixed sediments. Although larger sand particles sink, many smaller particles remain suspended in the water, making it appear murky. This turbid liquid with suspended solid particles is called a suspension. The properties of a suspension lie between those of a solution and an insoluble substance. A cup of sugar water in which the sugar is completely dissolved is a solution. Sugar is the solute, and water is the solvent. However, if a small amount of iron filings is placed in water, it will not dissolve even after stirring. This is called insoluble. A suspension lies between these two, but is closer to a solution. In a solution, sugar molecules are evenly distributed among the water molecules as single units. In a suspension, multiple solute molecules gather together and are interspersed among the solvent molecules. A characteristic of this suspension is that it precipitates more quickly when it encounters an electrolyte.

    Seawater contains a large amount of salt, the main component of which is sodium chloride, a strong electrolyte. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, it forms positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. The clay in the suspension of large rivers usually carries a negative charge. When it flows to the river mouth and encounters the positively charged sodium in seawater, the electrical charges immediately neutralize, causing a large amount of clay to quickly precipitate, forming large sandbars. Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River and many sandbars at the mouth of the Pearl River in China are formed in this way. (Liang Jinhe)

专栏：为什么？

　　大江河的入海口有沙洲
    大江河的入海口有沙洲，这不是地理问题，而是化学问题。大江河，由于长久流经大陆，夹杂搅拌了的泥沙，大的沙粒虽经下沉，但水中还悬浮了很多较小的粒子，看上去很浑，这种悬浮着的固体粒子的混浊液体叫悬浊液。悬浊液的性质，介于溶液和不溶液之间。一杯完全溶化了的糖水，就是溶液。糖为溶质，水为溶剂。但是如果把少许铁沙放入水中，虽经搅拌，仍不溶解，这就叫作不溶，悬浊液介乎这二者之间，但近似溶液、溶液中糖的分子是成单个的均匀地分布在水分子中间，而悬浊液则是多个溶质的分子聚集在一起，插在溶剂的分子中间。这种悬浊液有一特性，就是遇到电解质，便加速沉淀。
    海水中含有大量食盐，食盐的成分是氯化钠，氯化钠是强电解质。氯化钠溶在水中，形成带阳电荷的钠离子与带阴电荷的氯离子。大江河流悬浊液中的粘土多带负电荷，当它流到海口遇到海水中带正电荷的钠，电性立刻中和，于是大量粘土很快沉淀，形成了大沙洲。我国长江口的崇明岛，珠江口的很多沙洲，都是这样形成的。（梁金禾）
