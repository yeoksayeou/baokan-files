Chongqing, June 17th (From Our Own Correspondent) To ensure the thorough implementation of the general line for socialist construction and to carry the rectification through to the end, Chongqing city, in conjunction with the inspection of production work, conducted a massive mass rectification re-examination from mid-May to early June. According to statistics from 40 factories, mines, and enterprises in the city, more than 750,000 big-character posters were put up by the masses in ten days, and more than 780,000 opinions were put forward, a large portion of which expressed the masses' satisfaction with the rectification. The masses wholeheartedly and enthusiastically praised the great achievements made in the past year of rectification.

During the re-examination, the leaders of each unit, headed by the secretary, mobilized more than 20,000 cadres and more than 1 million people throughout the city, and adopted the methods of full and free airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to summarize the tremendous achievements of the past rectification phase, to check whether the rectification had been carried out thoroughly, whether the opinions of the masses had been seriously dealt with, and what new problems and new contradictions existed in the current work. The inspection proved that the rectification in most units in the city was serious, especially the rectification among responsible cadres was relatively thorough. However, it was also found that in about 10% of the units, the rectification was not thorough or there were blank spots.

These units where rectification was not thorough or had been missed were mainly some local industrial factories, field survey teams, drilling teams, and decentralized capital construction units, as well as some joint ventures and handicraft cooperatives, and individual large enterprises. According to statistics from Shapingba District, among the 45 factories under the district's jurisdiction, 26.66% had basically resolved the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and had better changes in leadership style after rectification; 48.89% had largely resolved the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the problems of leadership style, but had many remaining problems; 15.56% had carried out rectification perfunctorily, had not mobilized the masses, and had not resolved the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves; and 8.89% had not carried out rectification at all. From the perspective of changes in people, among the 98 factory-level cadres in these 45 factories, 27, or 27.55%, dared to think and act, were able to connect with the masses, and performed well after rectification; 47, or 47.96%, had drive but lacked methods and performed generally; 24, or 24.49%, had serious "three styles" and "five airs" and had not changed their old ways. In other districts, the proportion of local industrial small factories where rectification was not thorough or had been missed was generally 15%-20%. Handicraft cooperatives were scattered, and the situation was more complex. The proportion of units where rectification was not thorough or had blank spots reached 57.1% in the urban area and 33% in the Nan'an District.

In these units where rectification was not thorough or had been missed, politics had not been put in command, the "double opposition" (opposing capitalist tendencies) had not been carried out or had not been carried out thoroughly, and the "three styles" and "five airs" still existed; in some units, the leadership was in the hands of promoters of retreat, and right-leaning conservative thinking was serious, and the production plans were completed very poorly. For example, the Nantong Coal Mine, a large enterprise, where old workers from before liberation accounted for 25.13%, and workers with more than five years of service after liberation accounted for 85% of the total number of workers. There were many key personnel and good technical conditions. From January to May this year, 2,423 new records appeared, an average of 17 times a day, and the production potential was great. However, due to the incomplete rectification, middle-level cadres such as district chiefs and team leaders did not participate in the movement, and the mine manager's serious conservative thinking had not been transformed. Effective measures were not taken, and the plan was not completed for several months.

Among the local industrial small factories, it was not uncommon for conservatives to have the upper hand, as in the Nantong Coal Mine. According to the inspection, a considerable number of factories still had great potential, and the workers shouted "the task is too small, we are not full," but the leading cadres shouted that the plan was "too risky." A large proportion of these small factories and mines were jointly owned by public and private entities, with a relatively large number of capitalist elements. Because they had not undergone rectification or the rectification was not thorough, the bourgeois ideology and work style of these people had not been transformed. Their conservative thinking actually reflected the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between the two roads and two ideologies of socialism and capitalism.

In a small number of joint public-private factories and handicraft cooperatives, because the struggle to counterattack the rightists and counter-revolutionary socialist elements had not been carried out or had been carried out very incompletely, there was still a phenomenon that the leadership was impure or completely controlled by bourgeois elements or bad elements.

Based on the situation revealed by the inspection, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held two meetings of the Standing Committee to urge the relevant departments to effectively strengthen the leadership of the weak grassroots units. The Municipal Party Committee believes that although these weak links are only a few, they directly and indirectly affect the overall leap forward of various departments and tasks. The requirements and purposes of rectification must be achieved, and none should be lost. Through rectification, the red flag must be planted everywhere, the banner must be clear, the direction must be straightened, and there must be no ambiguity, and no blank spots should be allowed anywhere. Not only should bourgeois elements and bad elements not be allowed to control the leadership of certain units, but the leadership should not be allowed to be in the hands of conservatives, and it must be in the hands of advanced proletarian elements. The Municipal Party Committee determined that units where the problems between the enemy and ourselves have been basically resolved and the "three styles" and "five airs" have been basically overcome should organize cadres and workers to conscientiously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to further liberate their minds and thoroughly implement the general line; units where rectification and "double opposition" are not thorough should continue to make up for the lessons and, on the basis of improving the relationship between the Party and the masses and between cadres and the masses, carry out workers' participation in management, eliminate unreasonable rules and regulations, and carry out technological innovations; and those where the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves have not been thoroughly resolved must be thoroughly resolved to absolutely guarantee the leadership of the Party.

According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, all units in the city have recently focused their efforts on tackling the weak links at the grassroots level. Many units have relaunched full and free airing of views, first strengthening political and ideological work to solve leadership problems and fully mobilize the masses, severely rectifying and reforming, countering conservative thinking, and promoting production. All districts have transferred a group of strong cadres or old workers to strengthen the leadership of backward units and promote rectification and production at the same time.

### 深入贯彻总路线　把整风坚持到底  重庆进行群众性整风大复查  加强薄弱环节，消除空白点，让红旗处处飘扬

    深入贯彻总路线　把整风坚持到底
    重庆进行群众性整风大复查
    加强薄弱环节，消除空白点，让红旗处处飘扬
    本报重庆17日电　为了保证社会主义建设总路线的深入贯彻，把整风坚持进行到底，重庆市从5月中旬到6月上旬结合检查生产工作，进行了一次声势浩大的群众性的整风大复查。据全市四十个厂、矿、企业单位的统计，十天内群众就贴出大字报七十五万多张，提出七十八万多条意见，其中，有很大一部分是群众对整风表示满意的，群众衷心地、热烈地赞扬整风一年来所取得的伟大成绩。
    在复查中，各单位由书记挂帅，全市发动了两万多干部和一百多万群众，采取大鸣大放、大辩论和大字报的方式，总结了过去这一段整风的巨大成就，检查了整风是否进行得彻底，对群众意见是否认真处理，当前工作中存在什么新问题、新矛盾。检查证明：全市大部分单位整风是认真的，特别是负责干部中的整风比较彻底。但也发现了大约10％的单位，整风不透或是空白点。
    这些整风不彻底或漏掉的单位，主要是一些地方工业厂子、野外活动的勘测队、钻探队和分散的基本建设单位、和一些合营厂店、手工业社等，其中也有个别大型企业。据沙坪坝区的统计，全区所属四十五个工厂经过整风，敌我矛盾基本解决、领导作风转变较好的，占26.66％；敌我矛盾和领导作风问题大体解决，但遗留问题较多的，占48.89％；整风走过场，群众没有发动，敌我矛盾未解决的，占15.56％；整风根本没有进行的，占8.89％。从人的变化来看，这四十五个工厂共有厂一级干部九十八人，经过整风敢想敢干，能联系群众，表现较好的有二十七人，占27.55％；有干劲，但办法少，表现一般的有四十七人，占47.96％；“三风”、“五气”严重，老样子未改的有二十四人，占24.49％。其他各区地方工业小厂整风不彻底或漏掉的，一般有15％—20％。手工业社分散，情况更为复杂，整风不透或空白点，城区达到57.1％，南岸区33％。
    这些整风不彻底或漏掉的单位，由于政治未挂帅，“双反”没有搞或搞得不透，“三风”、“五气”仍然存在；有些单位领导权掌握在促退派手里，右倾保守思想严重，生产计划完成的很差。如南桐煤矿，这是一个大型企业，解放前的老工人占25.13％，加上解放后有五年以上工龄的工人，达到工人总数的85％，骨干多，技术条件较好，从今年1至5月出现新纪录二千四百二十三次，平均每天十七次，生产潜力很大。但由于整风不彻底，区长、班长等中层干部未参加到运动中来，矿长严重的保守思想未转变，没有很好的采取切实有效的措施，以致几个月都没有完成计划。
    在地方工业小厂中，像南桐煤矿这样保守派占上风的也不是个别的。据检查，有相当一部分厂子潜力还大，工人喊“任务少，吃不饱”，领导干部却大叫计划“冒”了。这些小型厂矿属于公私合营性质的占很大比例，资方人员较多，有些厂主要的科室、车间，都是资方人员负责。由于没有经过整风或整风不彻底，这些人资产阶级思想作风没有得到改造，他们的保守思想实际上反映了无产阶级与资产阶级、社会主义与资本主义两条道路、两种思想的矛盾和斗争。
    在少数公私合营厂子、手工业社里，由于反击右派和反击反社会主义分子的斗争没有进行或进行得极不彻底，还存在着领导成分不纯或完全由资产阶级分子、坏分子掌握领导权的现象。
    根据检查出来的情况，中共重庆市委员会两次召开常委会议，督促各有关部门切实加强对基层薄弱单位的领导。市委认为，这些薄弱的环节尽管只是少数，但直接、间接影响着各部门和各项工作的全面跃进。整风的要求和目的都要达到，一个也不能丢掉，通过整风，一定要把红旗插遍，要旗帜鲜明，方向摆正，一点不含糊，任何地方不许有空白点。不仅不能容许资产阶级分子、坏分子掌握某些单位的领导权，也不能让领导权掌握在保守派手里，一定要掌握在无产阶级先进分子手里。市委确定：凡敌我问题基本解决，“三风”、“五气”基本克服的单位，应组织干部、职工认真学习“八大”二次会议文件，进一步解放思想，以深入贯彻总路线；凡整风、“双反”不彻底的，应继续补课，在党群、干群关系改善的基础上，进行工人参加管理、破除不合理规章制度、开展技术革新等工作；对敌我矛盾解决不彻底的，坚决搞彻底，绝对保证党的领导。
    全市各单位根据市委指示，最近一个时期都把力量放在突击基层薄弱环节。许多单位重新大鸣大放，首先加强政治思想工作解决领导问题和充分发动群众，狠狠整改，反击保守思想，推动了生产。各区都抽调了一批强的干部或老工人，加强落后单位的领导，把整风和生产同时推动起来。
