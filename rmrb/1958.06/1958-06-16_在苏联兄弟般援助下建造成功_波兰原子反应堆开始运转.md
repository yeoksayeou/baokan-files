Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 14th: Poland's first atomic reactor, built with Soviet assistance, began operation on the 14th.

　　This reactor is located in Swierk, near Warsaw, and has a thermal capacity of two thousand kilowatts, which will be increased after improvements are made in the future.

　　A ceremony was held in Swierk on the afternoon of the 14th to mark the start of the reactor's operation. Those present included Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nowak, and figures from the scientific community. Soviet Director of the General Administration for the Use of Atomic Energy under the Council of Ministers Yemelyanov and Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Abrasimov, also attended the ceremony. The Polish Government Plenipotentiary for the Use of Nuclear Energy, Billig, spoke at the ceremony. He said: The Soviet Union's proposal to provide Poland with a reactor and a cyclotron was a turning point in the development of our nuclear research. This has made it possible for Poland to develop scientific and technical disciplines that Poland was previously unfamiliar with, such as radiochemistry, uranium technology, chemical nuclear analysis, reactor engineering, and radiation protection.

　　Billig pointed out that the start-up of this atomic reactor and the subsequent start-up of the cyclotron, as well as the commissioning of the two new nuclear centers built in Swierk and Bronowice, mark Poland's entry into a stage of intensive scientific research and practical application of nuclear energy: establishing the initial foundations of Poland's atomic industry, gradually developing nuclear energy, and applying radioisotopes in industry, medicine, biology, and agriculture. According to the plan, Poland has already started preliminary work on building a power reactor and intends to have this reactor start operating in the next three to four years. The basic goal for the next five years is to build the first industrial atomic power station.

　　Yemelyanov congratulated the Polish scientists and technicians on their success at the ceremony. He said that Polish scientists can get help from international cooperation in their work and reliable assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

　　After the reactor started operating, Cyrankiewicz, on behalf of the Polish government, expressed his gratitude to the builders of the reactor and the Soviet friends who helped in its construction. Finally, Cyrankiewicz and Nowak awarded high state medals to those who had contributed to the construction and management of the reactor.

    在苏联兄弟般援助下建造成功
    波兰原子反应堆开始运转
    据新华社华沙14日电　在苏联帮助下建造的波兰第一个原子反应堆14日开始运转。
    这个反应堆设在华沙附近的斯维尔克，它的热容量为两千瓩，将来经过改进后还将提高。
    14日下午在斯维尔克举行了这个反应堆开始运转的典礼，出席的有波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹、部长会议副主席诺瓦克和科学界人士等。苏联部长会议原子能利用总管理局局长叶麦利扬诺夫和苏联驻波兰大使阿布拉西莫夫也参加了典礼。波兰利用核能政府全权代表比利格在典礼上讲话。他说：苏联向波兰提供一个反应堆和回旋加速器的建议是我们核研究发展上的一个转折点。这使得波兰有可能发展一些波兰过去还不了解的科学和技术学科，例如放射化学、铀工艺学、化学核分析、反应堆工程学和放射防护学等。
    比利格指出，这个原子反应堆的开始运转和以后回旋加速器的开始运转，以及在斯维尔克和布罗诺维茨新建设的两个核中心的开始使用，使波兰进入紧张的核能科学研究和实际应用的阶段：建立波兰原子工业的初步基础，逐步发展核能，在工业、医药、生物学和农业方面运用放射同位素。根据计划，波兰已经开始了建造动力反应堆的初步工作，并打算使这个反应堆在今后三、四年内开始工作。今后五年中的基本目标是建成第一个工业用的原子能发电站。
    叶麦利扬诺夫在这个典礼上祝贺波兰科学家和技术人员的成功。他说，波兰科学家们能够在他们的工作中得到国际合作的援助，得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的可靠的援助。
    当反应堆开始运转后，西伦凯维兹代表波兰政府对反应堆的建设者和帮助进行建设的苏联友人表示感谢。最后由西伦凯维兹和诺瓦克向建设和管理反应堆有功的人员颁发国家的高级勋章。
