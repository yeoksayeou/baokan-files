Factories Need Workers On Call, Agriculture at Idle Times, Go Home to Farm
Shanxi Agricultural Cooperatives Universally Establish Reserve Workers

This dispatch from Taiyuan, June 4th: Shanxi Province is universally establishing a reserve worker system to support industry in agricultural cooperatives throughout the province. This was proposed by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after summarizing experiences from various places in the province.

The reserve worker system involves agricultural cooperatives selecting a certain number of members from the able-bodied labor force to serve as a reserve labor force to support industry, available on call to ensure the needs of industrial construction. When not needed by industrial departments, they immediately return to the agricultural cooperative to participate in agricultural labor. Establishing a reserve worker system in agricultural cooperatives allows industrial enterprises to use fewer fixed workers and more long-term contract workers and short-term temporary workers, reserving the backup labor force needed for industrial construction in agricultural production. This ensures both the labor force needed for industrial construction, avoiding idleness and waste of labor in industrial departments, and facilitates agricultural cooperatives in arranging labor plans and cultivating skilled farmers.

Recently, local committees of the Chinese Communist Party have held industrial conferences to discuss this method, selecting typical counties to begin pilot programs. According to the results of the planning in the pilot counties, generally 8% to 10% of the able-bodied labor force can be drawn to serve as a reserve force to support industry. After formulating plans, each agricultural cooperative, according to the six economic cooperation zones in the province, established a regular contact system and signed contracts between industry, agricultural cooperatives, and laborers. Yangcheng County, after vigorously establishing factories this year, needs to increase its workforce by more than 10,000 workers. Recently, the county convened a meeting of township and cooperative cadres to discuss the establishment of a reserve worker system and conducted discussions and planning in more than 400 agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, finally signing contracts. In this way, the 120 small fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, and small processing plants that are put into production throughout the county this year can reduce the number of fixed workers and only use fixed contract workers and temporary workers supplied by the agricultural cooperatives.

The Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Guancheng Village, Xiazuo Township, Xin County, found six measures to solve the tight labor situation in the agricultural cooperative, turning labor shortage into surplus, and finally drawing out 11% of the labor force to establish a reserve team to support industrial construction.

The implementation of the reserve worker system has been welcomed by both factories and agricultural cooperatives. They say that with this unified planning and arrangement of labor, not only is the needs of industrial construction ensured, but agriculture is also unaffected. Each agricultural cooperative also adopted a relatively fixed approach in planning the labor force to support industry, so that some farmers in the agricultural cooperative can gradually become familiar with industrial technology by frequently participating in factory production, becoming new farmers with skills in the countryside.

Agricultural cooperatives in five counties, including Daren, are also piloting a new labor and wage system while implementing the reserve worker system, stipulating that during the period when reserve workers go out to work, all wage income, except for a certain amount paid to the agricultural cooperative for agricultural tax, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and obligatory work fees, goes to the individual. In addition, various places also stipulate that during the period when reserve workers go out to work, agricultural cooperatives sell them grain at state-controlled prices to ensure their grain supply. This greatly encourages the enthusiasm of cooperative members to support industrial construction.

In the past, the labor force needed by industrial enterprises in Shanxi Province was mainly resolved by signing contracts with agricultural cooperatives or farmers themselves flowing into cities as temporary workers. However, after the upsurge of industry run by the whole people and the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture, labor became tight in both urban and rural areas, and even fixed contract workers could not be guaranteed to be satisfied. Moreover, in the future, many county towns and market towns will become small and medium-sized industrial cities, and the rational arrangement of labor will be even more important. In addition, many factories and mines have seasonal needs for labor, and idleness and waste often occur after the peak season has passed. The universal establishment of the reserve worker system in agricultural cooperatives can solve the above two problems.

### 工厂需要  随叫随到  工厂闲空  回家务农  山西农业社普遍建立预备工

    山西农业社普遍建立预备工
    本报太原4日电　山西省正在各地农业社中普遍建立支援工业的预备工制度。这是中共山西省委总结全省各地经验以后提出的。
    预备工制度，就是由农业社从全劳力中抽出一定数量的社员，作为支援工业的劳动力预备队，随叫随到，保证工业建设需要。在工业部门不需要时，他们就即时回到农业社参加农业劳动。在农业社建立预备工制度，可以使工业企业少用固定工人，多用长期合同工人和短期临时工人，把工业建设所需要的后备劳动力储备在农业生产上。这样，既可保证工业建设需要的劳动力，避免工业部门窝工浪费劳动力；又可便于农业社安排劳动计划，和培养有技术的农民。
    最近，各中共地方委员会都举行了工业会议，讨论了这个办法，选择典型县开始了试点。据各地试点县规划的结果，一般都可在全劳力中抽出8％到10％的人，作为支援工业的预备队。在制订规划以后，各农业社按照全省六个经济协作区，规定了经常联系制度，签订了工业、农业社、劳动者三者之间的合同。阳城县今年大力兴办工厂以后，需要增加一万多工人。最近全县召开了乡社干部会议，讨论了建立预备工制度问题，并且在全县四百多个农业社里进行了讨论、规划，最后签订了合同。这样，全县今年投入生产的一百二十个小化肥厂、颗粒肥料厂和小加工厂，就可减少固定工人，只用农业社供应固定合同工和临时工就行了。
    忻县下佐乡关城村五星农业社，找寻了六条措施，解决了农业社劳动紧张状况，变劳力不足为有余，最后抽出了11％的劳动力，建立起支援工业建设的预备队。
    预备工制度的推行，受到了工厂、农业社双方的欢迎。他们说，这样一规划，劳动力统一安排，不但保证工业建设需要，而且也使农业不受影响。各农业社还在规划支援工业的劳动力中，采取了相对固定的办法，使农业社里有一部分农民通过经常参加工厂生产，逐步熟悉工业技术，成为农村里有技术的新农民。
    大仁等五个县的农业社，还在实行预备工制度的同时，拟定了新的劳动工资制度进行试点，规定预备工在出外做工期间，工资收入除向农业社交纳一定数量的农业税、公积金、公益金和义务工费外，全部归本人收入。此外，各地还规定了预备工外出做工期间，农业社按照统销价格卖给他们粮食，保证他们的粮食供应。这样就大大鼓励了社员支援工业建设的积极性。
    山西省过去工业企业需要的劳动力，主要是依靠与农业社签订合同，或农民自己流入城市充当临时工人来解决。但是，全民办工业和工农业同时跃进以后，城乡劳动力都紧张起来，甚至连固定合同工也不能保证满足。而且今后许多县城、集镇，都将变为中小型工业城市，合理安排劳动力就更加重要了。此外，许多厂矿对劳动力的需要有季节性，在紧张季节过去以后，常常发生窝工浪费现象。农业社普遍建立预备工制度以后，就可以解决上述两方面的问题。
