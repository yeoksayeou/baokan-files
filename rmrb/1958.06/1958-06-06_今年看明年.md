Today's edition of this newspaper publishes news about the measures taken in Hebei, Fujian, Sichuan, and other regions to arrange for an even greater leap forward in production next year. Not long ago, this newspaper also published news that the Hubei Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Gucheng County, Xiangyang Prefecture, in early May, attended by the First Secretaries of the local Party committees and county committees, to summarize the summer harvest and arrange for winter sowing. The province will then hold meetings on water conservancy and transportation to unify the planning for various tasks in the coming winter and spring. Simultaneously or shortly thereafter, provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Yunnan also convened similar on-site wheat meetings to summarize the experiences of high wheat yields and to begin arranging and preparing for winter sowing. A mass movement to carefully select superior wheat varieties has now been launched in various parts of Henan and Anhui.

Holding on-site meetings in areas with high wheat yields before the wheat harvest, and promptly summarizing and disseminating the experiences and lessons of this season's wheat production, is a continuation and development of the mass line work method that has greatly developed since last winter. Attendees conduct field visits and debates in areas with high wheat yields, while also listening to indoor reports of successful model experiences and conducting indoor research. After seeing firsthand the wheat growth and harvest conditions in advanced areas, leaders and mass representatives from various regions quickly broke down their past doubts about the increased production in advanced areas, and thereby resolved to learn good practices and experiences from advanced areas in an honest manner. At the same time, as a result of on-site visits and debates, questions that had not been resolved for a long time in the past, such as whether dense planting is better or sparse planting is better, whether deep plowing is better or shallow plowing is better, whether weeding is better or not weeding is better, whether this kind of seed is better or that kind of seed is better, and so on, could all be given practical conclusions. This kind of vivid and concrete visit and discussion is extremely effective in persuading the masses, and it is also convenient to promote advanced technologies and experiences, so that on-site visits, on-site teaching, and on-site problem-solving can be achieved. This kind of on-site visit and discussion not only affirmed the achievements of high-yield areas, but also discovered their shortcomings, which is also very beneficial for preventing high-yield areas from becoming arrogant due to their success and for spurring them to make greater efforts and strive for another leap forward in the future.

Convening a winter sowing meeting before the wheat harvest is even more significant in that it further develops the leadership method of "looking at the year ahead from the previous winter." As everyone knows, while proposing the slogan of "fighting hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of the region," Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the situation of the production upsurge last winter, also proposed the leadership method of "looking at the three years from the first year, and looking at the first year from the previous winter," requiring that preparations be made for the next year's production in the previous winter. Now, the facts have proven that this leadership method has played a huge and positive role in this year's great leap forward in production. Now, convening a winter sowing meeting before the wheat harvest, "looking at next year from this year," and putting forward new goals and new tasks to the masses and cadres to strive for a greater harvest of summer crops next year. This allows for early publicity and mobilization among the masses, encouraging everyone to fully discuss, so that plans and targets are more realistic. The material and technical preparations required for winter sowing and other production and construction activities can also be arranged early, so as not to dig a well only when thirsty, causing confusion or excessive tension. This greatly strengthens foresight and planning, making it more confident to strive for a greater harvest next year.

What can be done for wheat can of course be done for other crops. For example, before the rice harvest, a rice meeting can be held to summarize and evaluate this year's rice production, promote advanced experiences in rice production, and formulate concrete plans for increasing rice production next year, so that the leadership of rice production has better planning. If this can be done in all aspects of cotton, oil crops, etc., it will definitely be of great benefit to increasing production next year.

What can be done for various crops can of course also be done for construction in various aspects such as water conservancy, soil improvement, and afforestation. If provinces can hold water conservancy meetings earlier this year, make more adequate preparations and detailed plans, and spread various advanced and successful experiences as soon as possible, the water conservancy construction in the coming winter and spring will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements.

In this way, "looking at the next step from the current step, looking at next year from this year" should become an important leadership method, and it can be equally applied in industrial and basic construction and other construction undertakings. For example, holding a meeting in the second quarter of this year to initially formulate the target plan for major industrial production sectors next year, and organizing grassroots units to discuss it as early as possible, after about half a year of deliberation, revision, and supplementation, will result in more appropriate overall arrangements for the supply of raw materials, the preparation of transportation capacity, and the allocation of technical and labor forces, which will be conducive to next year's leap forward. The passive and chaotic phenomena caused by issuing the year's plan targets only in March and April of the year in the past few years will likely be largely avoided.

This year is a year of great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings. The experiences in all aspects are very rich. We should attach great importance to summarizing these experiences, and we should strive to summarize these experiences as early as possible. While summarizing these experiences, we should formulate a new leap forward plan for next year, so that cadres and the masses will not be complacent and relaxed because of victory, maintain full revolutionary vigor, and develop our cause from one upsurge to another. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us that we communists are proponents of continuous revolution. After the Chinese people have basically completed the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, our Party has put forward new revolutionary tasks—the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution. In all our undertakings, in our daily work, we should also, according to this spirit of continuous advancement, put forward new tasks when a task is completed or even about to be completed, and always move vigorously from one victory to another. From this perspective, the leadership method and work method of "looking at next year from this year" is even more worthy of universal promotion.

### 今年看明年

　　今年看明年
    今天本报发表了河北、福建、四川等地安排明年生产更大跃进的措施的消息。不久以前，本报也发表了湖北省委5月上旬在襄阳专区的谷城县召开了各地委、县委第一书记参加的现场会议，总结夏收，布置冬播的消息。这个省接着还要召开水利会议，交通会议，统一规划今冬明春的各项工作。与此同时或稍后一点，山东、河南、安徽、云南、河北等省也召开了类似的小麦现场会议，总结小麦丰产经验，并开始布置和准备冬播。河南、安徽各地现已展开精选小麦良种的群众运动。
    在麦收前就到小麦丰产地区召开现场会议，及时地总结和传播本季小麦生产的经验教训，是去冬以来大大地发展了的群众路线的工作方法的继续发展。与会者在小麦丰收的地区进行田间参观、辩论，同时也听取成功的典型经验的室内报告，进行室内研究。各地领导人和群众代表亲眼看到先进地区的小麦生长状况和收成情况之后，很快就打破了过去对先进地区增产的怀疑，从而下定决心老老实实向先进地区学习好的做法和经验。同时，现场的参观和辩论的结果，过去长期没有得到结论的问题，如密植好还是稀植好，深耕好还是浅耕好，中耕锄草好还是不中耕锄草好，这类种子好还是那类种子好，等等，都能够得到实际的结论。这种生动具体的参观和讨论，对于说服群众有极大的效力，也便于推广先进技术和经验，做到当场参观，当场教学，当场解决问题。这种现场参观和讨论，不但肯定了丰产地区的成绩，而且还发现了他们的缺点，这对于防止丰产地区因胜而骄并鞭策他们作更大的努力，争取今后再来一个跃进，也很有好处。
    在麦收前就召开冬播会议，更重要的意义在于它进一步发展了“头年看前冬”的领导方法。大家知道，在提出“苦战三年，基本改变本地区面貌”的口号的同时，毛泽东同志根据去冬生产高潮的形势，又提出了“三年看头年、头年看前冬”的领导方法，要求在前一年的冬天就为下一年的生产做好准备。现在事实已经证明，这个领导方法对今年生产大跃进起了巨大的积极作用。现在在麦收前就召开冬播会议，“今年看明年”，把准备工作从冬天提早到夏天，向群众和干部提出争取明年夏收作物更大丰收的新目标，新任务。这样就可以及早在群众中进行宣传动员，发动大家充分讨论，使计划和指标更加切合实际。对于冬播等生产建设活动所需要的物资和技术准备，也就可以及早作出安排，而不至于临渴掘井，发生混乱，或过分紧张。这就大大加强了预见性和计划性，更加有把握争取明年更大的丰收。
    小麦可以这样做，其他农作物当然也可以这样做。比如说，在水稻收获之前，可以召开水稻会议，总结评比本年度水稻生产，推广水稻生产的先进经验，制定下年度水稻增产的具体计划，使水稻生产的领导具有更好的计划性。在棉花、油料作物等各方面，如果都能这样做，对于明年增产一定有很大好处。
    各种农作物可以这样做，水利、土壤改良、植树造林等各方面的建设，当然也可以这样做。今年各省如果都能提早召开水利会议，做了比较充分的准备和详细的计划，及早传播了各种先进的成功的经验，今冬明春的水利建设就一定会取得更加辉煌的成就。
    这样看来，“上步看下步，今年看明年”应当成为一个重要的领导方法，在工业和基本建设方面以及其他各项建设事业同样是可以应用的。比如说，今年第二季度就召开会议，初步制定出明年主要工业生产部门的指标计划，并且尽早地组织基层单位讨论，经过半年左右的酝酿、修改和补充，就会在原材料的供应上，运输力量的准备上，技术力量和劳动力的调配上，都得到比较妥善的统筹安排，有利于明年的跃进。过去几年中因为当年3、4月才下达当年计划指标而造成的被动和忙乱现象，将有可能大部避免。
    今年是我国工农业生产以及其他各项建设事业大跃进的一年，各方面的经验是非常丰富的，应当十分重视总结这些经验，并且应当争取尽早地总结这些经验。在总结这些经验的同时，就应当制订明年的新的跃进计划，使干部和群众不致因胜利而自满和松劲，保持饱满的革命干劲，使我们的事业一个高潮又一个高潮地发展下去。毛泽东同志一再教导我们，我们共产党人是不断革命论者。在我国人民基本上完成了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命之后，我们党就提出了新的革命任务——技术革命和文化革命的任务。我们在一切事业中，在日常工作中，也都应当根据这样的不断前进的精神，在一个任务完成甚至将要完成的时候，就提出新的任务，永远朝气蓬勃地从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。从这个角度来看，“今年看明年”这种领导方法和工作方法就更加值得普遍推广了。
