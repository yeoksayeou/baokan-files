    A Heartening Event
    From July 1st, the average reduction in passenger and freight rates on domestic civil aviation routes will be 40%. This is a measure of positive significance to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and accelerate the country's socialist construction.
    The characteristic of civil aviation is its ability to serve national construction and the people's lives through rapid transportation. Over the past few years, China's civil aviation transportation business has developed rapidly, with a total turnover increasing by an average of about 30% annually. An aviation network centered on Beijing, connecting more than 40 cities at home and abroad, has been established. Excellent safety flight records have also been maintained on domestic and international routes over the years. These achievements basically meet the needs of national economic development. However, in the past, the civil aviation sector did not fully utilize the efficiency it should from this rapid aerial machinery, specifically manifested in high freight rates and insufficient carrying capacity, which restricted the use of aircraft in various aspects and was not conducive to the development of civil aviation.
    Now, during the rectification campaign, the staff of the Civil Aviation Administration have broken through conservative thinking in terms of cost accounting and fully tapped technical potential, which has prepared favorable conditions for lowering freight rates. With the reduction of air freight rates, the possibility of using air transport in various aspects has increased, and the number of civil aviation flights has also been decided to increase accordingly. This is indeed a heartening event in the great leap forward of national industrial and agricultural production.
    Civil aviation is part of the entire transportation sector. It and other transportation departments should implement a rational division of labor according to different characteristics, and cooperate and promote each other. It is necessary to vigorously develop and rationally utilize air transport, and also to continuously develop and rationally utilize land and water transport. If the technical potential of airplanes, trains, ships, automobiles, and even carts and wheelbarrows can be fully utilized, China's transportation industry will surely see a new situation of comprehensive and vigorous development.

    一件可喜的事情
    从7月1日起，国内民用航空线的客货运价平均降低40％，这是支援工农业生产大跃进、加速国家社会主义建设的一项有积极意义的措施。
    民用航空的特点，是能以快速运输为国家建设和人民生活服务。过去几年来，我国民用航空运输业务发展很快，总周转量每年平均增加30％左右，并且建成了一个以北京为中心的、联接国内外四十几个城市的航空网；在国内和国际航线上几年来也一直保持着优异的安全飞行纪录。这些成就，基本上适应于国家经济发展的需要。但是，在过去有个时期，民航事业部门对于这种快速空中机械的利用还没有发挥应有的效能，具体表现在运价太高，载运不足，既限制了各方面对飞机的利用；也不利于民航事业的发展。
    现在，民航局工作人员在整风中从成本核算上打破了保守思想，充分挖掘了技术潜力，为降低运价准备了有利条件。随着航空运价的降低，各方面利用空运的可能性增加了，民航飞行班次也决定相应增加；在全国工农业生产大跃进中，这确是一件可喜的事情。
    民用航空是整个交通运输事业的一部分，它和其他交通运输部门应该按照不同的特点实行合理的分工，互相配合也互相促进。既要大力发展和合理利用航空运输，也要不断发展和合理利用陆运和水上运输。如果能够使飞机、火车、轮船、汽车以至大车和独轮车的技术潜力都充分地发挥出来，我国的交通运输事业，就一定会出现一个全面蓬勃发展的新局面。
