    Husband and Wife Challenge: Sending Each Other Good News
    Platoon Leader Li Hongbin's wife, Liu Jiayu, actively responded to the call from higher authorities and was among the first to return to her hometown to engage in agricultural production. Before leaving, she said to Li Hongbin, "Bin! I have no objections to returning to my hometown for production this time. I am a woman of peasant origin, and I won't embarrass you after returning home, so please rest assured! But I have a suggestion, I wonder if you agree?" Li Hongbin thought she was joking, so he smiled and said, "Go ahead! What valuable suggestion do you have?" "Let's have a competition, husband and wife, for the sake of mutual progress. There is only one condition: to see who sends more good news..." Li Hongbin was very happy to hear this and readily agreed, saying, "Okay! I now accept your challenge...". Thus, their husband-and-wife competition began.
    Li Hongbin's educational level was relatively low, making it difficult for him to learn shooting. Several assessment scores were failing, but he was not discouraged. One shooting assessment failure made him very distressed. He couldn't sleep that night, repeatedly thinking, "I am a Communist Party member. Can I shrink back when I encounter difficulties in advancing? Educational level is by no means the main condition for good academic performance. The main thing is that I haven't studied hard enough, and I haven't put in enough effort. Drill! I must drill! I must drill into it...". He made a great determination to study the artillery shooting rules, humbly asked others for advice, and if he didn't understand it once, he tried twice; if he didn't understand it twice, he tried three times. He seized all the time to practice, and as a result, he achieved excellent results and was rated as a second-level technical expert.
    One day, he wrote a letter to Liu Jiayu to report the good news, enclosing the big good news report of his technical expertise in the letter. Less than a week after the letter was sent, he received a reply. He opened the letter, thinking: This time, I'm ahead of Liu Jiayu, she will definitely congratulate me! To his surprise, the envelope didn't contain a letter, but a big red good news report. It read: "Comrade Liu Jiayu, on the production front and in various tasks, has worked hard in production, actively responded to the government's call, maintained and carried forward glory, and has been rated by our county as an activist in socialist construction for military families. We hereby announce the good news." Below was written: Fuling County People's Committee. (Peng Baocheng) (Attached picture)

    夫妻挑战　互寄喜报
    排长李洪斌的爱人刘加玉积极响应上级号召，头一批返乡从事农业生产。临行前，她对李洪斌说：“斌！这次我返乡生产没有一点意见，我是农民出身的妇女，回家后不会给你丢脸，请放心吧！不过我有个建议，不知你同意不？”李洪斌还以为她在开玩笑，便笑着说：“提吧！你有什么宝贵的建议？”“咱们为了共同进步，夫妻俩竞赛吧。条件只有一个，看谁的喜报寄得多……”李洪斌一听很高兴，满口答应说：“行！我现在就向你应战……”。就这样他们夫妻俩的竞赛开始了。
    李洪斌文化程度较低，学习射击有些吃力，几次的考核成绩都不及格，但他并没有灰心。有一次射击考核不及格，使他很伤脑筋，当天晚上睡不着觉，反复地想：“我是个共产党员，遇到前进中有困难能退缩吗？文化高低决不是学习成绩好坏的主要条件，主要是我钻得不够，还没有下苦工夫。钻！要钻！一定要钻进去……”。他下了很大的决心钻炮兵射击规则，虚心请教别人，一次不会二次，二次不通三次，抓紧了一切时间练习，结果取得了优秀的成绩，并被评为二级技术能手。
    一天，他写了封信向刘加玉报喜，信中装入了那张技术能手的大喜报。信发走不到一个星期，就收到了来信。他边拆信边想：这回，可跑到刘加玉的前头，她一定会给我祝贺的！出乎他的意料之外，信封内不是信，而是一张红色大喜报。上面写着：“刘加玉同志，在生产战线上和各项工作中，努力生产，积极响应政府号召，保持和发扬光荣，经我县评为军属社会主义建设积极分子，特此报喜。”下面写着：涪陵县人民委员会。（彭保成）（附图片）
