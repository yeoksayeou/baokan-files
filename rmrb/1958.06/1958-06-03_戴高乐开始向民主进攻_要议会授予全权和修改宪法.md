Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd dispatch from Paris: After the French National Assembly approved the government formed by De Gaulle on the evening of June 1st, De Gaulle immediately proposed three bills, as stated in his declaration when requesting authorization from the parliament, concerning granting the government full powers and amending the constitution, demanding that the National Assembly discuss and pass them as "urgent matters."

The National Assembly hastily reconvened that evening at 11:20 PM Paris time to discuss these bills. The first bill proposed by De Gaulle, requesting the granting of emergency powers to the government, effectively meant the government taking over the legislative power of the parliament. The bill stipulated: "For six months from the date of promulgation of this law, the government shall take legislative measures necessary to restore the country by issuing orders." The "statement of reasons" attached to the bill emphasized that "normal means are no longer sufficient, and the government must have the broadest powers."

The second bill concerning the amendment of the constitution stipulated the modification of Article 90 of the constitution (the article concerning the procedure for amending the constitution), so that the amendment of the constitution could be carried out without the need for a vote by both houses of parliament followed by a referendum, but only by the government "drafting a draft constitution to be submitted to a referendum vote. The constitutional amendment law shall be promulgated by the President of the Republic within one week after the law is passed." This procedure of amending the constitution, which completely bypasses the representatives of the people elected by the people, allows the head of government to arbitrarily amend the fundamental law of the country.

In addition, De Gaulle also proposed a bill to extend the government's emergency powers in Algeria.

These three bills were scheduled to be discussed at a plenary session of the National Assembly on the morning of June 2nd.

### 戴高乐开始向民主进攻  要议会授予全权和修改宪法

　　戴高乐开始向民主进攻
    要议会授予全权和修改宪法
    新华社2日讯  巴黎消息：在法国国民议会1日傍晚通过批准戴高乐组成的政府以后，戴高乐立即根据他在要求议会授权时发表的声明，提出关于授予政府全权和修改宪法等三项法案，要求国民议会作为“紧急问题”来讨论和通过。
    国民议会在当天晚上巴黎时间十一时二十分又匆促复会来讨论这几个法案。戴高乐提出的第一个要求授予政府以紧急权力的法案实际上是要由政府来接掌议会的立法权。这个法案规定：“自这项法律颁布之日起的六个月中，政府将通过发布命令的方式来采取为恢复国家所必需的立法措施。”附在法案之后的“理由陈述”强调说，现在“正常的手段已经不够，政府必须掌握最广泛的权力。”
    第二个关于修改宪法的法案规定修改宪法第九十条（关于修改宪法的程序的条款），使得修改宪法可以无需经过议会两院表决后再举行公民投票，而仅仅由政府“起草要提交公民投票表决的宪法草案。宪法修正法由共和国总统在该法通过后一星期内颁布。”这种完全绕过人民选出的议会代表的修改宪法的程序使政府首脑可以独断独行地任意修改国家的根本大法。
    除此以外，戴高乐还提出了延长政府在阿尔及利亚的紧急权力的法案。
    这三个法案预定在2日上午由国民议会全体会议讨论。
