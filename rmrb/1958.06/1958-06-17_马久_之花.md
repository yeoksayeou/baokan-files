    The "Majiu" Flower

    Spring in Hungary is like a large garden, with flowers and trees blooming all over the mountains and plains, and the fragrance of flowers emanating from the courtyards of every household. One Sunday, we went from Budapest to the small town of Mezőkövesd in the eastern region to participate in a traditional ethnic festival held there – "Majiu Day."

    Many residents of this town are named Majiu, so people call the townspeople Majiu people. Legend has it that the ancestors of the Majiu people settled here thousands of years ago, thus forming the ancient ethnic traditions of the Majiu people, especially the unique folk art traditions. This festival – "Majiu Day" – was held to inherit and promote the excellent artistic traditions of the Majiu people, and the town's newly built People's Art Museum also opened on this day.

    On the day of the festival, colorful flags were hung everywhere in the town, and people from nearby villages and towns also came here dressed up beautifully. The band played ethnic songs, and young men and women in colorful ethnic costumes sang and danced, creating a lively atmosphere.

    After visiting the newly opened Folk Art Museum, one knows that the "Majiu" flower is indeed well-deserved. Here are displayed various ethnic costumes, daily necessities, and furniture of the Majiu people from more than a hundred years ago, as well as some works by modern famous Majiu artists. Whether on clothing, curtains, or bedsheets, there are various colorful flowers and various patterns, with lively strokes and harmonious colors. The same flowers are also painted or carved on wooden boxes, beds, and tables and chairs. The most attractive of the exhibits are the artworks of old Mrs. Zsuzsánna József. On display here is a pattern she painted, completed in one stroke from beginning to end, with various beautiful flowers properly and lively coordinated.

    Old Mrs. Zsuzsánna József is a well-known old artist in the town. She is still alive, and she and her two daughters are working in the town's folk art cooperative, drawing patterns. There are now two hundred female members in this cooperative, and thousands of people take work home from here for processing. On this festive day, the cooperative exhibited modern "Majiu" artworks, with "Majiu" flowers blooming on tablecloths, chair cushions, napkins, porcelain, and wooden products. These precious artworks are not only sold domestically but also sell well abroad.

    “马久”之花
    春天的匈牙利就像一个大花园，漫山遍野，花木盛开，家家户户的院子里都散发出花香。一个星期天，我们从布达佩斯去东部地区的麦左戈维什德小镇，参加那里举行的一个传统的民族节日——“马久日”。
    这个小镇的很多居民名叫马久，因此人们就把镇上的人都叫作马久人。相传在千年以前，马久人的祖先就在这里定居下来，所以形成了马久人的古老的民族传统，特别是独特的民间艺术传统。这次的节日——“马久日”就是为了继承和发扬马久人的优秀艺术传统而举办的，镇上新建的人民艺术博物馆也在这一天开幕。
    节日这天，镇上到处悬挂着五彩缤纷的旗子，附近村镇的人也打扮得漂漂亮亮的到这里来了。乐队奏着民族歌曲，穿着鲜艳的民族服装的青年男女，载歌载舞，热闹非常。
    参观了新开幕的民间艺术博物馆，就知道“马久”之花确是名不虚传。这儿陈列了一百多年前马久人的各种民族服饰、日用品和家具，也陈列有一部分现代著名马久艺人的作品。无论服装、窗帘、被单上都绣着各色花朵和式样众多的图案，笔调活泼，色彩调和。木箱、床和桌椅上也绘着或雕刻着同样的花朵。展览品中最吸引人的要算是朱哈伊·约瑟夫老太太的艺术作品了。这里展出了她画的一幅图案，从头到尾一笔画成，各种不同的美丽花朵配合得当，均匀活泼。
    朱哈伊·约瑟夫老太太是镇上有名的老艺人，她还健在，而且和她的两个女儿都在镇上的民间艺术合作社里担任绘制花样的工作。这个社里现在有二百名女社员，此外还有上千的人从这里把活计领回家里去加工。节日这一天，合作社展出了现代的“马久”艺术品，桌布、椅垫、餐巾、磁器和木制品上都开放着“马久”的花朵。这些名贵的艺术品不仅行销国内，而且畅销国外。
