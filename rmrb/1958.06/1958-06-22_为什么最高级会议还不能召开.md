    Why Has the Highest-Level Meeting Still Not Been Convened?
    The Soviet government's proposal to convene a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries has been around for more than six months, and peace-loving people in all countries have been hoping that this meeting will be held soon to eliminate the "Cold War" and ease international tensions. During this period, the heads of government of the countries concerned have exchanged letters on the above-mentioned proposal many times, and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko has also held many consultations with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France in Moscow, but so far, the convening of the summit meeting is still nowhere in sight. What is the reason for this?
    The answer to this question can be found in the letter written by Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the heads of government of the three Western countries on the 11th of this month, and in the Soviet document on the proposal for the summit meeting to discuss issues published on the 17th of this month. That is: the three Western countries, mainly the United States, are doing their best to obstruct and attempt to bury the summit meeting before it is even convened. The recent talks by the heads of government of the United States and Britain are only trying to defend their absurd positions and even attempt to put the responsibility for delaying the convening of the summit meeting on the Soviet Union. This approach of theirs will not allow them to escape the accusations of peace-loving people and public opinion in all countries.
    It is very clear to people that the Soviet Union and Western countries have always adopted two completely different attitudes on the issue of the summit meeting. The Soviet Union has always done everything possible to promote the convening of the meeting to meet the expectations of the people of all countries; while the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have tried every means to resist the efforts of the Soviet Union and prevent the meeting from being convened.
    These two completely different attitudes of the Soviet Union and Western countries are first manifested in the procedural issues concerning the preparation of the meeting. In its proposal on January 8 this year, the Soviet Union proposed that the summit meeting be held within two or three months, and that a foreign ministers' meeting be held after the summit meeting. The purpose of this proposal was to enable the summit meeting to be held early without any obstacles. However, the Western countries, under the pretext of making "full preparations," insisted on holding a foreign ministers' meeting first, which was obviously a delaying tactic. In order to promote the convening of the meeting, the Soviet Union accepted this opinion of the Western countries and suggested that a foreign ministers' meeting be held in April this year to discuss the agenda, members, date, and location of the summit meeting. Under these circumstances, the Western countries created extra obstacles, insisting that substantive issues must be discussed through diplomatic channels and at the foreign ministers' meeting. The Western countries also proposed that diplomatic talks be held before the foreign ministers' meeting, in other words, another obstacle was added to the preparation for the summit meeting. In order to remove the excuses of the Western countries on the procedural issues of preparation, the Soviet Union again agreed to the Western countries' proposal to hold diplomatic talks.
    However, the Western countries not only obstructed the preparatory procedures, but also used even more egregious methods on the agenda issues. On the agenda issue, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated that the summit meeting should discuss issues that can be resolved. Based on this principle, the Soviet Union also accepted some of the opinions of the Western countries and successively put forward the twelve agenda items listed in the proposal of May 5. Anyone can see that the twelve agenda items proposed by the Soviet Union are all for the purpose of eliminating the "Cold War" and the nuclear arms race, and further expanding economic and cultural exchanges between countries with different social systems. Obviously, the Soviet Union's request to discuss these issues is not for its own special interests, but to further ease international tensions and achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. However, the Western countries are not interested in many issues raised by the Soviet Union that are conducive to eliminating the "Cold War" and the nuclear arms race, and have even adopted a negative attitude. On the other hand, they insist on including some issues aimed at intensifying the "Cold War" on the agenda of the summit meeting. These issues include the so-called situation in Eastern European countries and the issue of German reunification. The Western countries have fabricated the so-called situation in Eastern European countries, which is a blatant slander and provocation against the Eastern European socialist countries, and is therefore completely intolerable. As for the issue of German reunification, this is a matter for the German people themselves, and no one else has the right to act on their behalf. The Soviet Union has repeatedly made it clear to the Western countries that these issues cannot be the subject of discussion at the summit meeting at all. However, the Western countries stubbornly refuse to change their absurd position. This shows that the Western countries are deliberately trying to obstruct the convening of the summit meeting.
    The reason why the diplomatic talks that began in Moscow on April 17 have been stalled is precisely because the Western countries have adopted the above-mentioned stubborn attitude.
    In addition to working hard in diplomatic negotiations to promote the convening of the summit meeting, the Soviet Union has also taken a series of peace-seeking measures to ease international tensions in order to create conditions for the smooth holding of the summit meeting. The Soviet Union, together with the Warsaw Treaty member states, has decided to reduce its armed forces by 419,000 men in 1958, of which the Soviet Union will reduce 300,000 men. The Soviet Union also unilaterally announced the suspension of nuclear weapons tests on March 31 this year. In addition, after obtaining the consent of the Romanian government and the Hungarian government, the Soviet Union has decided to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in Romania in the near future, and to withdraw another division of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary. All of this shows the Soviet Union's sincere desire for peace. And this desire is precisely the fundamental reason why the Soviet Union is actively promoting the convening of the summit meeting.
    In contrast, the imperialist countries continue to expand their armaments and prepare for war to exacerbate international tensions. The United States has decided to establish US nuclear warhead rocket launch sites and atomic weapons depots on the territories of Britain, France, Italy, Turkey, and other countries; the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has decided to arm the West German army with atomic and rocket weapons; after the Soviet Union stopped nuclear weapons tests, the United States and Britain have continuously conducted large-scale nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific region. Recently, the United States and Britain have been constantly increasing their troops in the Eastern Mediterranean, actively preparing for armed intervention in Lebanon. The actions of the United States and its partners show that they are wholeheartedly continuing to implement the "policy of strength" that has long gone bankrupt, attempting to use this to get rid of the economic difficulties they face and suppress the national independence movements in Asia and Africa in order to maintain their rule over the old world. Therefore, they do not welcome but fear the easing of the international situation, and therefore they are doing their best to obstruct the convening of the summit meeting.
    At present, Western countries, especially the United States, are looking for excuses to further undermine the summit meeting. Anyone with a little sense will admit that the execution of the counter-revolutionary criminal Nagy in Hungary has nothing to do with the summit meeting. However, Eisenhower insisted at a press conference on the 18th of this month that this incident "thwarted" the hope of convening the summit meeting. This is certainly not due to Eisenhower's mental disorder or incoherent speech, but shows that the US ruling group is deliberately trying to undermine the summit meeting.
    In his letter on the 11th of this month, Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, asked the United States and other Western countries to immediately state whether they sincerely hope to convene the summit meeting. This request is very timely and reasonable. The convening of the summit meeting has been delayed by the Western countries for more than six months, and now they cannot be allowed to continue to delay it. The Western countries must immediately abandon their policy of delay and obstruction, otherwise they cannot escape the responsibility for undermining the summit meeting.

### 为什么最高级会议还不能召开

    为什么最高级会议还不能召开
    苏联政府提出召开东西方国家最高级会议的建议已经六个多月了，各国爱好和平人民一直企望这个会议早日举行，来消除“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势。在这个期间里，有关国家的政府首脑就上述的建议已交换了多次的信件，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯并与美、英、法三国大使在莫斯科进行了多次的商谈，可是直到目前为止，最高级会议的召开依然渺茫无期，这究竟是什么缘故呢？
    对于这个问题，人们可以从本月11日苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫写给西方三国政府首脑的信和本月17日发表的苏联关于最高级会议讨论的问题的建议的文件中得到答复。那就是：西方三国，主要是美国，竭力阻挠，并企图在最高级会议未召开之前就把它埋葬掉。美英政府首脑近日发表的谈话，徒然想为自己的荒谬立场辩护，甚至企图把拖延召开最高级会议的责任加在苏联头上。他们的这种做法，并不能使他们逃脱各国爱好和平人民和舆论对他们的指责。
    人们看得很清楚：在对待最高级会议的问题上，苏联和西方国家一直是采取着两种截然不同的态度。苏联总是竭尽一切可能来促成会议的召开，来满足各国人民的企望；而美、英、法政府却是千方百计地抵制苏联的努力，使会议不能召开。
    苏联和西方国家这两种截然不同的态度，首先表现在关于准备会议的程序问题上。苏联在今年1月8日的建议中，曾主张在两、三个月内召开最高级会议，而在最高级会议之后再举行外长会议。这个建议的目的是为了使最高级会议可以毫无阻碍地早日举行。可是，西方国家却借口要进行“充分的准备”而主张先举行外长会议，这显然是一种拖延手法。苏联为了促成会议的召开，接受了西方国家的这个意见，并建议在今年4月召开外长会议来讨论最高级会议的议程、成员、日期和地点。在这种情况下，西方国家又节外生枝，坚持必须经过外交途径和在外长会议上对实质问题进行讨论。西方国家并主张在外长会议之前先进行外交会谈，换句话说也就是对最高级会议的准备又添设了一道障碍。苏联为了解除西方国家在准备程序问题上的借口，又同意了西方国家关于举行外交会谈的主张。
    但是，西方国家不仅在准备程序问题上进行阻挠，而且在议程问题上施展了更为恶劣的手法。在议程问题上，苏联一贯地主张最高级会议应当讨论那些可以解决的问题。根据这个原则，苏联也接受了西方国家的一些意见，先后提出了5月5日的建议中所列的十二项议程。任何人都可以看出，苏联所建议的十二项议程，都是为了消除“冷战”和核军备竞赛，以及进一步扩大不同社会制度国家之间的经济和文化的交流。显然，苏联要求讨论这些问题，并不是为了本身的特殊利益，而是为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势，实现不同社会制度国家之间的和平共处。然而西方国家对于苏联所提出的有助于消除“冷战”和核军备竞赛的许多问题却毫无兴趣，甚至采取了否定的态度，另一方面则坚持要把一些目的在于加剧“冷战”的问题列入最高级会议的议程。这些问题包括了所谓东欧国家局势问题和德国统一问题。西方国家制造出什么所谓东欧国家局势问题，这是对东欧社会主义国家的公然污蔑和挑衅，因而是完全不能容忍的。至于德国统一问题，这是德国人民自己的事，别的任何人都无权越俎代庖。苏联已一再明确地告诉西方国家，这些问题根本不能成为最高级会议讨论的对象。但是，西方国家却顽固地不肯改变它们的荒谬立场。这就表明西方国家是蓄意地要阻挠最高级会议的召开。
    从4月17日在莫斯科开始的外交会谈，其所以一直停滞不前，其原因就是由于西方国家采取了上述的顽固态度。
    苏联除了在外交谈判中努力促成最高级会议的召开以外，还采取了一系列的争取和平的措施，来缓和国际紧张局势，以便为最高级会议的顺利举行创造条件。苏联已与华沙条约缔约国一起，决定在1958年内裁减武装部队四十一万九千人，其中苏联裁减三十万人。苏联并于今年3月31日单方面宣布停止核武器的试验。此外，苏联还在商得罗马尼亚政府和匈牙利政府的同意后，决定在最近期间从罗马尼亚撤出苏联驻军，并从匈牙利再撤出一个师的苏联驻军。所有这一切，都表明了苏联对和平的真诚愿望。而这种愿望也正是苏联积极促进召开最高级会议的根本原因。
    与此相反，帝国主义国家却继续扩军备战，以加剧国际紧张局势。美国决定在英、法、意、土等国的领土上设立美国核弹头火箭发射场和原子武器仓库；北大西洋侵略集团决定以原子和火箭武器武装西德军队；在苏联停止核武器试验之后，美英两国连续大规模地在太平洋地区进行核武器试验。最近期间，美英两国更不断向东地中海增兵，积极准备武装干涉黎巴嫩，美国和它的伙伴们的所作所为，表明它们一心一意地在继续执行早已破了产的“实力政策”，企图借此摆脱它们所面临的经济困难，并镇压亚非地区的民族独立运动，以维持它们对旧世界的统治。所以，它们不是欢迎而是害怕国际局势的缓和，因而也就竭力要阻挠最高级会议的召开。
    目前，西方国家，特别是美国正在寻找借口来进一步破坏最高级会议。稍有理智的人都会承认，匈牙利处决反革命罪犯纳吉同最高级会议是“风马牛不相及”的两件事情。而艾森豪威尔在本月18日的记者招待会上竟然硬说这件事使召开最高级会议的希望“受到挫折”。这当然不是由于艾森豪威尔的神经失常，语无伦次，而是表明美国统治集团处心积虑地要破坏最高级会议。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在本月11日的信中，要求美国和其他西方国家立即表明它们是否真诚希望召开最高级会议。这个要求是十分适时的，而且也是十分合理的。最高级会议的召开已被西方国家拖延了六个多月了，现在不能再让它们继续拖延下去了。西方国家必须立即放弃它们拖延和阻挠的政策，否则它们就不能逃脱破坏最高级会议的责任。
