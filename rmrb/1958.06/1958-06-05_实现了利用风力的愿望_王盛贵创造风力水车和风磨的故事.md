　　Realized the Wish to Utilize Wind Power
　　——The Story of Wang Shenggui's Creation of Wind-Powered Waterwheels and Windmills
　　By our reporter Shao Yongli
    Wang Shenggui had long harbored the idea of creating a new tool to alleviate the hardship of lifting water for irrigation. He grew up in the Datongchuan area of Shanxi Province, where wind is abundant and rain is scarce. Here, livestock were few, and farmers had to lift water from deep wells bucket by bucket, using scales and willow dippers, year after year. But the efficiency was low, and people were very tired. Therefore, Wang Shenggui always wanted to create a water-lifting tool that was efficient and labor-saving.

    One day, he went out to gather firewood and encountered a strong headwind on his way back, which almost stopped him in his tracks. He had thought about utilizing wind power long ago, and now his old idea resurfaced. Carrying the firewood, he turned back, and the howling wind made him run. He unloaded the firewood, and the wind no longer blew him. Moreover, when he turned around to walk against the wind again, it wasn't as difficult as when he was carrying the firewood. This experiment suddenly reminded him that if many large wind-catching surfaces were installed on the waterwheel, wouldn't the waterwheel turn?

    First Trial Production
    He ran home in one breath and immediately made a horizontal windmill model. The model turned rapidly in the wind, and he was very happy, showing it to others everywhere. The dream of several years saw a glimmer of realization today.

    This happened in the spring of 1952. Wang Shenggui sold three *shi* of grain from the previous year's income for three *shi*, bought some wood and iron sheets, and requested the government to lend him a small five-wheel waterwheel to officially start manufacturing the wind-powered waterwheel.

    As a result, the news that Wang Shenggui intended to make a wind-powered waterwheel spread in the village. Everyone said he was daydreaming, and many called him a madman. His wife couldn't stop him and divorced him.

    These were major blows to Wang Shenggui. "Give up? No! I must create a wind-powered waterwheel for everyone to see and open their minds!" This is how he motivated himself to devote himself even more to creation.

    However, one new difficulty after another fell on Wang Shenggui. He couldn't do carpentry or blacksmithing work. He asked all the carpenters and blacksmiths in the village, but no one was willing to help him, saying he was just fooling around. After saying all the nice things he could, he finally hired the worst craftsman at a high price. After ten days of work, a windmill was finally made.

    Success Is When Water Comes Out
    On the day of the test, the neighbors all wanted to see what this madman had actually created. More than a hundred people, young and old, came. As soon as the windmill was installed on the waterwheel, it began to turn, and the water flowed into the field. At this time, the joy in Wang Shenggui's heart was beyond description. Just a few minutes before, those who had called him a madman wanted to praise him. But before the time it took to smoke a pipe, the windmill frame was blown down by a strong wind. Now people were laughing again, and some even said, why would we need donkeys if rabbits could pull carts!

    Contrary to everyone else, Wang Shenggui was very satisfied with this test. He thought the collapse of the windmill frame was not a failure, and success was when water came out. So he modified it again and again, tested it again and again. After more than a year of modification and testing, he finally achieved basic success. When the wind-powered waterwheel he created could irrigate five *mu* of land a day, he felt as if a weight had been lifted from his heart.

    Wang Shenggui had seen women working hard pushing the millstone every few days since he was a child, so after the successful creation of the wind-powered waterwheel, he thought of using wind power to grind grain.

    In winter, he opened up his roof, bought a millstone, and erected the windmill on the roof to test using wind power to drive the mill to turn. Because of his experience in creating the wind-powered waterwheel, although the trial production of the windmill also went through repeated research, it relatively quickly achieved basic success, being able to grind seven or eight *jin* of rice per hour.

    Rely on the Party and the Collective
    In the autumn of 1955, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation swept Wang Shenggui into the socialist torrent. In the cooperative, he saw his bright future and realized more clearly that wind-powered waterwheels and windmills had extensive uses in the cooperative. At the same time, he realized that the reason he had encountered so many difficulties and setbacks in the past was because he was working in isolation and had not received the help and support of the Party and the collective. Therefore, he wrote a letter to the Datong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requesting assistance. Sure enough, the county committee soon sent cadres and technicians to help him; later, the Yanbei Special District also sent a water conservancy engineer to study and improve many parts of the wind-powered waterwheel and windmill with him. They changed the original heavy wooden frame fan to a bamboo fan, which accelerated the rotation; and replaced the fixed iron disc on the windmill with iron wire, which reduced the resistance of the windmill and increased the efficiency of the mill.

    With the support of the Party and the government, and with the help and guidance of technical personnel, Wang Shenggui finally realized his ideal of letting the wind work for people.

    Now, with a level three wind force, the windmill he created can grind sixteen *jin* of flour per hour, which is seven times more efficient than manual milling; the wind-powered waterwheel can irrigate seven or eight *mu* of land per day and save two workers.

    Wang Shenggui's success finally opened the minds of the farmers. People no longer satirized or ridiculed him. He became one of the most beloved figures in the village. The women were even more grateful to him, because the windmill he created liberated them from turning the millstone.

    The cooperative where Wang Shenggui is located increased the number of irrigated wells from eighty to two hundred because they could use wind-powered waterwheels to draw water, greatly increasing the irrigated land.

    After the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward was launched throughout the country last winter, the county party secretary personally inspected his wind-powered waterwheel and windmill and believed that promoting them in Datong County, where there is frequent wind, could save a large amount of labor. So the story of Wang Shenggui's creation of wind-powered waterwheels and windmills spread throughout the county like the wind.

    At the National Agricultural Implements Exhibition, the reporter interviewed him. After describing his previous creative process, he pointed to a model of a wind-powered transportation vehicle next to him and said, I also want to let wind power help people with transportation: in the spring, use wind-powered transport vehicles to deliver manure, in the autumn, let them pull crops, in the summer, install windmills on waterwheels to pump water for irrigation, and in the winter, install windmills on mills to grind flour. One windmill can be used in all four seasons, which can save a lot of labor.

　　实现了利用风力的愿望
　　——王盛贵创造风力水车和风磨的故事
　　本报记者　邵永力
    王盛贵打算创造一种新工具来减轻提水浇地的劳苦，是由来已久的念头了。他生长在常年风多雨少的山西省大同川里，这里牲畜少，农民年年要从深井里用秤杆柳斗一下下提水浇地，但功效很小，人很劳累。因此王盛贵总想制造一个效率高、又省力的提水工具。
    有一天，他出去打柴，回来碰上迎面大风，吹得他几乎迈不开步。很早以前他就想过利用风力，这时他的旧念头重新浮起。他背着柴回头走，呼啸的大风刮着他飞跑，他卸下背上的柴，风就吹不动他了。而且当他再转身顶风走时，也不像刚才背着柴走那样困难。这个试验忽然使他想起，如果能在水车上安上许多大块迎风扇面，水车不就可以转了吗？
    初次试制
    他一口气跑回家，马上做了一个卧式风车模型，模型迎风呼呼转动，越转越快，他十分高兴，到处试着给别人看。几年的梦想，今天看到了实现的苗头了。
    这是1952年春天发生的事情。王盛贵把头一年收入的三石三斗粮食卖了三石，买了一些木料和铁皮，请求政府贷给了一部小五轮水车，正式着手制造风力水车。
    这一来，王盛贵想做风力水车的事就在村里传开了。大伙都说他空想，不少人叫他疯子，妻子阻止不住，跟他离了婚。
    这些对王盛贵是重大的打击。“不搞了吗？不能！一定要把风力水车造成给大伙看看，让他们打开脑筋！”他就这样激发自己更加埋头创造。
    但是一个个新的困难又落到王盛贵的头上。他不会做木工和铁匠活儿，请遍全村的木匠和铁匠，没有一个人愿意帮他，都说他瞎胡闹。他说尽了好话，最后用高价请到一个手艺最差的木匠。经过十天的工夫，一架风车算是做成了。
    车出水来就是成功
    要试验的那一天，邻里们都想看看他这个疯人究竟搞出个什么名堂来，老老少少来了一百多人。风车一安到水车上，就旋转起来，车出的水滚滚向田里流去。这时候王盛贵心里的高兴劲就不用提了，就在几分钟以前还说他是疯子的人，也都想夸奖他几句。可是没过一袋烟的工夫，风车架子就叫大风吹垮了。这下子人们又看笑话了，有的人甚至说，兔子能驾辕还要毛驴做什么！
    王盛贵和大家相反，他对这次试验很满意。他想风车架子散了不是失败，车出水来就是成功了。于是他一次又一次的修改，一次又一次的试验，经过一年多时间的修改试验，终于基本上获得了成功。当他创造的风力水车一天能浇五亩地时，心里好像一块石头落了地。
    王盛贵从小就看到妇女们三天两头推碾子很辛苦，所以他在风力水车创造成功之后，又想到利用风力推磨。
    他在冬天里把自己的房顶打通了天，买了一盘磨，把风车架在屋顶上，试验利用风力带动磨转。因为有了创造风力水车的经验，试做风磨虽然也经过反复研究，但比较快的获得了基本成功，每小时能磨米七、八斤。
    要依靠党和集体
    1955年秋季，农业合作化高潮把王盛贵卷进了社会主义洪流。在合作社里他看到自己的远大前途，也更清楚的知道风力水车和风力磨在合作社里用途广大，同时他觉悟到过去自己所以遇到那样多的困难和周折，是因为自己孤立的干，没有得到党和集体的帮助与支持，因此，就写信给中共大仁县委请求帮助。果然，县委不久就派了干部和技术人员去帮助他；后来雁北专署又去了一位水利工程师，和他共同研究改进了风力水车和风力磨上的许多零件，把原来很笨重的木架风扇改成了竹扇，加快了转数；又把风车上的固定铁盘改用了铁丝，减少了风车的阻力，提高了磨的效率。
    有了党和政府的支持，有了技术人员的帮助指导，王盛贵终于实现了让风替人出力的理想。
    现在有三级风力，他创造的风磨每小时就能磨面十六斤，比人工推磨提高效率七倍；风力水车每天能浇七、八亩地，还能节省两个人工。
    王盛贵创造的成功，到底打开了农民的脑筋，人们不再讽刺他、讥笑他了，他成了村里最受大家爱戴的人物之一；妇女更是感激他，因为他创造的风磨把妇女从围磨台转中解放出来了。
    王盛贵所在的合作社，因为可以用风力水车车水，从原来的八十眼井增加到二百眼，大大增加了水浇地。
    去冬各地掀起了生产大跃进的高潮以后，县委书记亲自考察了他的风力水车和风磨，认为在经常有风的大仁县里推广，可以节省一大批劳动力。于是王盛贵创造风力水车和风力磨的故事，像风一样的传遍了全县。
    在全国农具展览会上，记者访问了他。他在叙述了自己以前的创造过程后，指着身边放着的一个风力运输车的模型说，我还想让风力在运输上替人出力：春天里用风力运输车送粪，秋天让它拉庄稼，夏天把风车安在水车上抽水浇地，冬季把风车安在磨上磨面，一个风车四季都可以使用，能够节省不少的劳动力。
