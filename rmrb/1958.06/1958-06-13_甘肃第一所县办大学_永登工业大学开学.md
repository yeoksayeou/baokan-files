Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Gansu Province's first county-run university – Yongdeng Industrial University – officially opened on May 31st.

　　This new type of university does not have tall buildings or a large library and laboratory. It is temporarily using Yongdeng Middle School as its campus and factories and mines as its classrooms, libraries, and laboratories. The school's teaching policy is to combine theory with practice, learning, experimenting, and interning simultaneously. They will be self-sufficient through work-study programs. Currently, the school temporarily has three departments: Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgy, and Geology, with a study period of four years. The first batch plans to enroll fifty students. On May 30th, the University Admissions Committee had already admitted nineteen students from seventy applicants, including locomotive workers, agricultural cooperative members, demobilized soldiers, and a Dong ethnic minority woman from Yunnan. The second batch of enrollment is in preparation.

　　In the process of establishing this university, it received strong support and assistance from the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yongdeng Cement Plant, Lanzhou University, the 128 Geological Team, and Soviet experts. Soviet geological experts provided opinions on curriculum arrangements for the university. Yongdeng Cement Plant fully undertook the teaching tasks of the Mechanical Engineering Department, with the factory's Party Committee Secretary, Director, and Chief Engineer all serving as teachers. The school also uses Yongdeng County's local industry as an experimental factory. Students are students in the classroom and workers in the factory, which solves both the school's equipment problems and the factory's technical personnel problems. It only cost five hundred yuan to establish this industrial university.

    甘肃第一所县办大学
    永登工业大学开学
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃省第一所县办大学——永登工业大学已在5月31日正式开学。
    这所新型大学，没有高大的楼房和庞大的图书馆、实验室，暂时以永登中学为校址，以工厂、矿山做教室、图书馆和实验室。学校的教学方针是理论联系实际，边学习边实验、实习。他们将以勤工俭学的方法劳动自给。目前学校暂设机械、冶炼、地质三个系，学习期限为四年。第一批计划招收五十名学生。5月30日，大学招生委员会已从七十名报考生中录取了十九名，其中有电机车工人、农业社员、复员军人，还有从云南来的侗族妇女。第二批招生工作正在准备。
    这所大学在创办过程中，得到了中共甘肃省委、中共定西地委、永登水泥厂、兰州大学、一二八地质队以及苏联专家的大力支持和援助。苏联地质专家为大学提出了课程安排意见。永登水泥厂全部包下了机械系的教学任务，工厂党委书记、厂长、总工程师等都兼任教学工作。学校还利用永登县的地方工业做实验厂，学生在课堂是学生，进工厂是工人，既解决了学校设备问题，又解决了工厂的技术人材问题。办成这所工业大学，只花了五百元。
