One Household Plants One Sheng of Walnuts
County Party Secretary of Shang County, Shaanxi Province, Jiang Bichen

This was a big event, but it didn't attract much attention at first.

Last winter and this spring, the people of Shang County, Shaanxi Province, launched the "One Household Plants One Sheng of Walnuts" campaign. This movement did not initially attract widespread attention, and only a small news item "the size of a mahjong tile" appeared in the newspaper. However, later, when the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee discovered it, saying, "This is a big event," and received the support and encouragement of Chairman Mao, this movement became more widespread and quickly overfulfilled its task.

One household planting one sheng of walnuts, calculated at a minimum survival rate of 50%, can grow at least fifty trees. With more than 69,000 farm households in the entire county, this would mean planting 3.45 million trees. Some will blossom and bear fruit in three to five years, and in the peak period ten years later, they will produce more than 700,000 dan of walnuts annually. This item alone can bring each farm household an annual income of 250 yuan, more than double the current average household income from agricultural and sideline production. If these walnuts are used to extract oil, they will produce 55 million jin of oil annually. After supplying the entire county, 53 million jin can be transferred to other areas. If these walnuts are exported, they can earn the country 165,000 tons of steel annually. If we calculate based on the 310,000 farm households in our entire special district, walnuts can earn 760,000 tons of steel annually.

After careful accounting and extensive debate, people's thinking became clear. The entire county planted a total of 749 shi of walnuts. Then, a large number of "money trees" were planted, laying a foundation for prosperity for the people in the mountainous areas.

Because planting walnuts has such great benefits, this call was easily accepted by the masses. Once the prefectural committee proposed it, it immediately won the warm support of the broad masses. After further careful accounting and debate, people's thinking became clearer, especially after Chairman Mao's instructions were conveyed to the broad masses of cadres and people. People's enthusiasm was greatly encouraged. "Chairman Mao says it's good, so it can't be a bad thing," so everyone knew it and everyone acted. The youth proposed: "Plant walnuts, lay a foundation for prosperity, young people will be heroes." Women proposed: "Plant walnuts, be pioneers, surpassing Mu Guiying of old." Children proposed: "Young and bold like Luo Cheng, we will build walnut forests." They sang while planting walnuts: "The tree grows, I grow too. The tree gets big, I get big too. The tree is the material for national construction, I am the talent for national construction." Even the elderly proposed "to benefit future generations and be an old Huang Zhong in building the mountainous areas." Townships and cooperatives quickly launched mass seed donation campaigns, with Party members and activists taking the lead. At one meeting in Panhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guangdong Township, the director first reported donating one sheng, followed by his two sons and daughter-in-law, each donating one sheng. Under their leadership, the entire cooperative raised seven and a half dou of seeds in one go, reaching one and a half sheng per household. Many people visited relatives and neighbors, and even went to other townships and counties to collect walnut seeds. Many women donated the walnuts they had saved for their children for the Spring Festival. "Blitz days" and "blitz weeks" of planting walnuts appeared everywhere. Townships and cooperatives completed or overfulfilled their planting tasks in three, five, or ten days. After two short-term high tides, the county planted a total of 749 shi of walnuts, overfulfilling the task by 107%. The masses said excitedly, "This extra effort was really good. We accomplished several years' worth of work in a few days, laying a foundation for prosperity for the people in the mountainous areas."

The "One Household Plants One Sheng of Walnuts" campaign brought about a wave of planting economic forests. Townships and cooperatives widely planted economic trees such as peppercorns, chestnuts, persimmons, grapes, lacquer trees, and tung oil, adapting to local conditions. Taking advantage of this momentum, according to the instructions of the prefectural committee, we put forward the call for "Each household to plant a hundred 'money trees' (economic forests)." This call quickly became a nationwide movement in which everyone participated. Five days for a lacquer tree depression, three days for a grape township, one day for a peppercorn mountain… Many inspiring good news reports came frequently. In more than half a month, the county planted more than 16 million various economic trees, averaging 203 trees per household. Thus, a large number of "money trees" went up the mountains.

In the past, people thought that "poor mountains and black rocks have no future," but now they know that "socialism is right under our feet."

The development of the "One Household Plants One Sheng of Walnuts" movement enhanced the confidence of the broad masses in building the mountainous areas and opened people's eyes. In the past, many people believed that Shang County was "poor mountains and black rocks with no future" and wanted to go to the city and plains to "find socialism." But now, they see the economic forest seedlings growing vigorously all over the mountains and fields, and think of the beautiful future of the mountainous areas, they know that "socialism is right under our feet" and "as long as we work, there is socialism." In the past, many people did not believe that there could be any "future" in the mountains, but today, they understand that "as long as we have the determination, nothing is impossible."

After the nationwide rectification movement, in the Great Leap Forward in production, the enthusiasm of the people of Shang County is even higher. The people of the county are determined to work hard for a year to realize terracing, water conservancy, and afforestation, increase grain production by 50%, and continue to expand the planting of various economic forests in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. We will turn barren mountains into treasure mountains and mountain valleys into paradise.

Small things that are in the interests of the masses, if handled seriously, can also become big things.

The "One Household Plants One Sheng of Walnuts" movement tells us: We cannot underestimate those "small things." As long as they are in the interests of the masses and are things that the broad masses care about, even if they are small things, if we handle them seriously, they can bring great benefits to the masses and turn small things into big things. At the same time, it also tells us: Those immediate economic interests that the masses care about, as long as we handle them well, will not only satisfy the masses but will also produce significant political effects. Planting walnuts has enhanced the confidence of the people in the mountainous areas in construction and promoted the Great Leap Forward in the construction of the mountainous areas, which proves this point. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, always care about the interests of the masses, care about the lives of the masses, be good at concentrating the demands of the masses, seek welfare for the masses, and better give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses in building socialism.

    一户种一升核桃
    陕西省商县县委书记  姜弼臣
    这是一件大事，但开始时没有引起人们的注意。
    陕西商县人民去冬今春，开展了“一户种一升核桃”的运动。这个运动开始并没有广泛引起人们的注意，在报纸上也只登了“像麻将大的”那样一块消息。但后来，当省委领导同志发现，说“这是一件大事”，并得到毛主席的支持和鼓励后，这个运动才更加普遍地开展起来，迅速超额完成了任务。
    一户种一升核桃，按最低成活率50％计算，至少能种活五十棵，全商县六万九千多农户，就能种活三百四十五万棵。有的三、五年即开花结果，十年后的旺盛期，每年将产核桃七十多万担。仅这一项就可使每一农户一年收入二百五十元，比现在每户平均农副业收入还多一倍多。如果用这些核桃榨油，每年将产油五千五百万斤，除全县人民食用外，还可以外调五千三百万斤；用这些核桃出口，每年可给国家换回钢材十六万五千吨，如果以我们全专区三十一万农户计算，一年用核桃就能换回钢材七十六万吨。
    经过算细账和大辩论，人们的思想通了。全县总共种了核桃七百四十九石。接着又种了大量“摇钱树”给山区人民扎下了富根。
    由于种核桃有这样大的好处，因此这个号召就极易为群众所接受，一经地委提出，便立即博得了广大群众的热烈拥护。又经过一番算细账和展开辩论，人们的思想更通了，特别是毛主席的指示传到了广大干部和群众中间，人们的情绪受到极大的鼓舞，“毛主席都说好，绝不会办下瞎瞎事”，于是，家喻户晓人人行动。青年提出：“种核桃，扎富根，青年人儿当英雄。”妇女提出：“种核桃，打先锋，赛过当年穆桂英。”少年提出：“人小胆壮是罗成，我们要造核桃林。”他们并一边种核桃，一边唱着：“树长我也长，树大我也大，树是国家建设的用材，我是国家建设的人才。”连老年人也提出了“要为后代造福，为建设山区当个老黄忠。”各乡、各社迅速展开了群众性的献种运动，党团员、积极分子纷纷带头。广东乡盘花农业生产合作社，在一次会议上，社主任首先报了一升，接着他的两个儿子、一个儿媳妇，也各报了一升。在他们的带动下，全社一次筹集种子七斗半，每户达到一升半。很多人走亲戚串邻居，甚至到外乡外县收集核桃种子。不少妇女把留给小孩过春节的核桃也献了出来。到处出现了种植核桃的“突击日”和“突击旬”。各乡各社经过三天、五天或十天就全部完成或超额完成了种植任务。全县经过短时期的两个高潮，总共种了核桃七百四十九石，以107％超额完成了任务。群众兴奋地说：“这一把劲实在加得好，几天把几年的事办了，给山区人民扎下了富根。”
    “一户种一升核桃”的运动，带来了大量栽种经济林木的热潮，各乡各社都因地制宜地普遍栽种了花椒、板栗、柿子、葡萄、漆树、桐油等经济林木。我们趁着这一股劲，依照地委的指示又提出“每户再种百棵‘摇钱树’（经济林木）”的号召。这一号召同样迅速地成为人人动手的全民运动。五天一个漆树洼，三天一个葡萄乡，一天一座花椒山……，许多振奋人心的捷报，频频传来。在半月多的时间内，全县共栽种了一千六百多万棵各种经济林木，每户平均达到二百零三棵，于是“摇钱树”就大量地上了山。
    过去，人们认为“穷山黑石头，发展没前途”，现在才知道“社会主义就在自己的脚下”。
    “一户种一升核桃”运动的开展，增强了广大群众建设山区的信心，打开了人们的眼界。过去，有不少人认为商县是“穷山黑石头，发展没前途”，要到城里和平川去“找社会主义”；但是现在，他们看到了满山遍野的经济林木幼苗茁壮，想到了山区未来的美好前景，才知道“社会主义就在自己的脚下”、“只要干，就有社会主义”；过去有很多人不相信在山沟里能有什么“出息”，但是今天，他们懂得了“只要有决心，上天也不难”。
    经过全民整风运动，在生产大跃进中，商县人民的干劲更加高涨，全县人民决心苦战一年，实现梯田化、水利化和绿化，使粮食产量提高50％，并且遵照毛主席的指示，继续扩大种植各种经济林木。要把荒山变成宝山，要把山沟变成乐园。
    符合群众利益的小事，认真办起来，也会变成大事。
    “一户种一升核桃”的运动，告诉我们：不能轻视那些“小事”，只要是符合群众利益的，为广大群众所关心的事，那怕是小事，如果认真地办起来，就能给群众带来很大利益，使小事变成大事。同时，它还告诉我们：为群众所关心的那些切身经济利益，只要我们办得好，不仅群众满意，而且会产生重大的政治作用。种核桃增强了山区人民的建设信心，促进了山区建设的大跃进，正说明了这一点。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的指示，时刻关心群众利益，关心群众生活，善于集中群众的要求，为群众谋福利，更好地发挥广大群众建设社会主义的积极性。
