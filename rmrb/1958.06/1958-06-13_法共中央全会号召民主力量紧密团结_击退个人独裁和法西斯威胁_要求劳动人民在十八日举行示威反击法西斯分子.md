Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 11th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party, which concluded its plenary session on the 10th, issued a resolution after discussing the French situation and the party's tasks, according to TASS, Paris, June 11th.

    The resolution emphasized: "De Gaulle used conspiracy to seize power. De Gaulle is at the center of this conspiracy. This conspiracy has given him the means to promulgate laws, amend the constitution, appoint and dismiss ministers, use the army, and carry out repression. He adjourned parliament and refused to provide guarantees of social rights. He is preparing to hold a popular vote. This is not simply a change of government; the issue lies in measures aimed at eliminating the republican system, and these measures have already led to the establishment of a personal regime free from the democratic supervision of the people. Behind the De Gaulle regime looms the threat of fascism...

    "This dictatorial government was imposed on France by exploiting the Algerian and Ajaccio coups, the threat of armed intervention by rebellious generals, and the intimidation of civil war. The facade of the rule of law cannot conceal the true nature of the national coup, and those parliamentarians who agreed to give up their rights betrayed the people's trust in them and abandoned the republic."

    The resolution continued: "The first action of the De Gaulle government was to agree to the position of the extreme colonialists demanding the merger of Algeria with France. In doing so, he violated basic historical facts—violated the wishes of the Algerian people. He completely disregarded the fatal consequences that the war has brought to the French economy and the living conditions of the working people."

    Regarding De Gaulle's plan to hold elections in Algeria, the plenary session emphasized that when a country is ravaged by war and forcibly controlled by the leaders of a French rebel group possessing five hundred thousand troops, only an "election farce" is possible.

    The plenary session pointed out that more and more French people hope to resolve the Algerian issue peacefully through negotiations, and that only by "recognizing Algeria's right to independence can such negotiations begin, and only then can France and Algeria establish a new relationship based on voluntarism, mutual respect for the interests of both parties, and the maintenance of friendship between the two peoples."

    The resolution said: "Now more than ever, it is necessary to resolutely fight for peace in Algeria, because war leads to dictatorship, creates the threat of fascism, and causes poverty."

    The resolution exposed the purpose of the French reactionary forces in demanding the establishment of a "strong government" free from the control of voters, which is to establish a dictatorial regime capable of forcing the masses to accept its policies through coercion and deception.

    The resolution pointed out that De Gaulle's proposed "constitutional amendment" is precisely pursuing this goal. The national referendum to be held on October 5th and the "constitutional amendment" are both aimed at strengthening the policies of war and poverty that have been implemented by successive French cabinets for eleven years.

    The plenary session condemned the anti-communist policy, which "disregards the voices of six million French men and women and prevents their representatives from participating in the work of national institutions." The plenary session emphasized the responsibility of right-wing socialists, especially Mollet, for frequently violating the will of the voters and undermining the principles of the parliamentary system, for refusing to support the working class, and for refusing to form an alliance with the Communist Party.

    The resolution said, "The way to overcome the government's confusion and helplessness is not to throw democracy out the door. On the contrary, we should guarantee the normal functioning of democracy, restore the country's independence, and allow the working class and its parties to occupy their due seats in parliament and government, just like other parties…

    "Millions of men and women have launched massive demonstrations to defend democracy. This movement is still going on and will continue to develop.

    "This movement has put forward these major tasks: to establish, through democratic elections, tens of thousands of committees to defend the republic, which will be able to immediately counter all intimidation and attempts to use violence by fascists; with these committees, millions of French people will be able to say on October 5th: 'No' to dictatorship, 'No' to fascism, 'No' to war and poverty!"

    "The guarantee of victory in this struggle is the unity of the working class, the basis of which is the unity of Communists and Socialists, and the union of all democratic and national forces around the working class."

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 11th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party passed a resolution calling on the French working people and democratic forces to take strong action on June 18th to oppose the fascist demonstrations that the De Gaulle faction intends to organize on that day.

    The resolution called on all workers, republicans, and resistance fighters to unite all French people whose freedom is seriously threatened in powerful and numerous rallies and demonstrations in various enterprises, cities, and villages on June 18th; demanded that all workers, republicans, and resistance fighters show vigilance and counter any attacks that fascists may launch on that day; and further strengthen the unity of workers and the union of all republican forces, form hundreds of thousands of committees to defend the republic throughout the country, and turn June 18th into a great day against personal power and for the defense of the republic.

    法共中央全会号召民主力量紧密团结
    击退个人独裁和法西斯威胁
    要求劳动人民在十八日举行示威反击法西斯分子
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社巴黎11日讯：10日闭幕的法国共产党中央委员会全体会议在讨论了法国局势和党的任务之后发表了一项决议。
    决议着重指出：“戴高乐使用阴谋获得了政权。戴高乐处在这一阴谋的中心。这个阴谋给了他以颁布法律、修改宪法、任免部长、使用军队和进行镇压的手段。他让议会休会，拒绝提供对社会权利的保证。他准备举行人民投票。这并不是简简单单的政府更替，问题是在于旨在消灭共和制度的一些措施，而且这些措施已经导致建立摆脱人民的民主监督的个人政权。在戴高乐政权的背后出现了法西斯主义的威胁。……
    “这一独裁政府是利用阿尔及利亚和阿耶佐政变、利用叛乱将领武装干涉的威胁和进行内战的恫吓而强加于法国的。法制的幌子掩盖不住国家政变的真正性质，而那些同意放弃权利的议员们辜负了人民对他们的委托并且背弃了共和制。”
    决议接着说：“戴高乐政府的第一个行动就是同意极端殖民主义分子要求使阿尔及利亚同法国合并的立场。这样，他就违反了基本历史事实——违反了阿尔及利亚人民的愿望。他完全不考虑战争给法国经济和劳动人民的生活条件带来的致命后果。”
    至于戴高乐打算在阿尔及利亚举行选举的事，全会强调指出，当一个国家战火弥天，被拥有五十万军队的法国暴乱集团首领强迫控制着的时候，只可能出现“选举丑剧”。
    全会指出，越来越多的法国人希望通过谈判途径来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，只有“承认阿尔及利亚的独立权，才能够开始进行这种谈判，法阿两国才能够建立起以自愿、互相尊重双方利益和两国人民保持友好为基础的新关系”。
    决议说：“现在比任何时候都更需要坚决地为阿尔及利亚的和平而斗争，因为战争会导致独裁，造成法西斯主义的威胁和贫困”。
    决议揭穿了法国反动势力要求建立一个摆脱选民控制的“强有力的政府”的目的就是要建立一个能够通过强制和迷惑人民的途径，来强迫人民群众接受它的政策的独裁政权。
    决议指出，戴高乐提出的“修改宪法”的主张所追求的正是这个目的。将于10月5日举行的全民投票和“修改宪法”的目的都是要加强十一年来法国各届内阁所执行的战争和贫困的政策。
    全会谴责了反共政策，这个政策“无视六百万法国男女的呼声，不让他们的代表参与国家机构的工作”。全会强调指出了右翼社会党人，特别是摩勒对经常违背选民意志和破坏议会制度原则、对拒绝支持工人阶级和拒绝同共产党缔结联盟所负有的责任。
    决议说，“要克服政府的混乱现象和束手无策的窘境，办法不是把民主抛出门外，相反地，应该保证民主的正常作用，恢复国家的独立，让工人阶级和它的政党同其他政党一样在议会和政府里占有它们应有的席位……。
    “千千万万的男女掀起了声势浩大的示威运动来捍卫民主。这个运动还在进行，并且将继续发展。
    “这个运动提出了这些重大的任务：用民主选举方式建立成千上万个捍卫共和制的委员会，它们要能够对法西斯分子的一切恐吓和使用暴力的企图立即给以回击；有了这些委员会，千千万万法国人10月5日就能够说：‘不要’独裁、‘不要’法西斯主义、‘不要’战争和贫困！”
    “在这个斗争中取得胜利的保证是：工人阶级的团结一致，这种团结一致的基础是共产党人和社会党人的团结一致，所有民主力量和民族力量联合在工人阶级周围。”
    新华社巴黎11日电　法国共产党中央委员会全体会议通过了一项决议，号召法国劳动人民和民主力量在6月18日以强有力的行动来反对戴高乐分子打算在那一天组织的法西斯示威。
    这项决议号召一切劳动者、共和人士和抵抗战士，在6月18日这一天，在各个企业、城市和乡村里把自由受到严重威胁的一切法国人团结在强有力的、众多的集会和示威中；要求一切劳动者、共和人士、抵抗战士表现出警惕性，回击法西斯分子在那一天可能发动的任何袭击；并且进一步加强工人的团结和一切共和力量的联合，在全国组成数以千百计的保卫共和国委员会，把6月18日变成反对个人权力和维护共和国的伟大日子。
