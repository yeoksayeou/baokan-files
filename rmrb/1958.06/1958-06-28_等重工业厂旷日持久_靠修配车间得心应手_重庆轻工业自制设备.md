Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 27th: Light industrial factories in Chongqing have changed their practice of solely relying on heavy industry to solve machine equipment problems and have begun to rely on their own efforts to manufacture their own equipment.

Under the principles of overall planning, division of labor, and cooperation, textile factories throughout the city are converting their original repair shops into machine manufacturing plants. The 610 Textile Dyeing Factory has converted one of its repair shops into a machine manufacturing plant and has begun to partially trial-produce machine parts. In the future, this factory will manufacture spindles, rollers, etc., for textile factories throughout the city, and will also gradually trial-produce complete sets of machines such as spinning machines, wire machines, and lathes. The China Wool Textile Factory has recently successfully trial-produced technically complex twisting machines and woolen fabric machines, and plans to use these machines soon to expand production.

Pharmaceutical, papermaking, and enamel factories have recently successfully trial-produced thirteen types of machines. The Daxin Pharmaceutical Factory, which produces large quantities of glucose, has doubled its production task this year and needs to add equipment, but cannot buy it. After five days of hard work, the factory's employees recently used wood instead of metal to make a glucose crystallization machine, completely solving the problem of insufficient equipment.

    等重工业厂旷日持久　靠修配车间得心应手
    重庆轻工业自制设备
    据新华社重庆27日电　重庆市各轻工业工厂已经改变单纯依靠重工业解决机器设备问题的做法，开始自力更生、自制设备。
    全市纺织工厂在统筹安排、分工合作的原则下，正在把厂内原来的修配车间改为机器制造厂。六一○纺织染厂已将一个修配车间改为机器制造厂，并且开始部分地试制机器零件；这个厂今后将为全市纺织厂制造锭子、罗拉等，同时还要逐步试制纺纱机、钢丝机、车床等成套机器。中国毛纺厂最近已经试制成功技术比较复杂的捻线机、制呢机等，准备很快使用这些机器来扩大生产。
    制药、造纸、搪瓷等工厂，最近试制成功了十三种机器。大量生产葡萄糖的大新药厂，今年生产任务增加了一倍，需要增添设备，但是又买不到。全厂职工经过五天苦战，在最近用木料代替金属料制成了葡萄糖结晶机，完全解决了本厂设备不足的问题。
