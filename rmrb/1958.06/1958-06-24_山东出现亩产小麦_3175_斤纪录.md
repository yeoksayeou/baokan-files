Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd. The twenty-second production team of the Taiqian Agricultural Cooperative in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, harvested 6,541.5 jin of wheat from 2.06 mu of high-yield farmland, averaging 3,175.5 jin per mu. Cadres from the Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chengguan Township Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, together with the cooperative members, carefully measured the land and participated in threshing and weighing, proving that the yield was completely accurate.

Shou Zhang County has historically been a low-yield wheat area. This high-yield farmland was cultivated as an experimental plot by resident cadre Gao Jinliang, Secretary of the Taiqian Cooperative Branch of the Communist Party of China, Liu Lunxi, and others. Their main experiences were: deep plowing the land more than two chi before sowing, harrowing finely eleven times, and sowing forty jin per mu; applying fertilizer seven times and watering seven times from planting to harvesting.

    山东出现亩产小麦3175斤纪录
    新华社济南22日电  山东省寿张县台前农业社第二十二生产队有二亩零六厘小麦高额丰产田，共收小麦六千五百四十一斤半，每亩平均三千一百七十五斤半。中共寿张县委、城关乡农业技术指导站的干部同社员们一起，仔细丈量了土地，并参加打场、过秤，证明产量完全确实。
    寿张县历来是小麦低产地区。这块高额丰产田是驻社干部高金良、中共台前社支部书记刘伦玺等共同培植的试验田。他们的主要经验是：播种前土地深翻二尺多，细耙十一遍，每亩播种四十斤；从种到收分期施肥七次，浇水七次。
