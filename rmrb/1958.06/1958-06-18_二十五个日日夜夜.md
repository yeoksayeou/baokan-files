Twenty-Five Days and Nights
By Our Correspondent

    A new "Construction" type locomotive was born on the 15th at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. From then on, this factory ended its sixty-year history of only repairing locomotives and not manufacturing them. People say that this factory, which once stirred up a red storm, is now stirring up a red storm in construction in the Great Leap Forward.

    The "Construction" type locomotive is a behemoth weighing over a hundred tons, with tens of thousands of parts. Two years ago, it took more than twenty days to repair such a locomotive. Now, under extremely incomplete manufacturing equipment conditions, the factory's employees have successfully trial-produced it in twenty-five days.

    These were twenty-five days of non-stop work, day and night. After the leaders of the relevant departments raised the issue of manufacturing locomotives to meet the needs of national economic construction to this factory, the workers analyzed the factory's equipment, technical strength, and other conditions, believing that it was possible to manufacture locomotives, but at the earliest, a successful trial production could only be achieved this year by "October 1st". The Party's General Line was announced, and it illuminated people's hearts like a bright light, dispelling those outdated concepts. Therefore, a decision was made: to produce the first locomotive before "July 1st", leaping forward three months compared to launching by "October 1st". However, many workers said: "Without waiting for 'July 1st', we will successfully trial-produce it by June 15th!" The workers did not hesitate at all, and immediately started working. Originally, only a portion of people directly participated in the locomotive trial production work, but all the factory's employees cared about it and wanted to contribute their share. The personnel of the planning and accounting departments could not directly participate in the trial production work, so they helped organize drawings and compile drawing catalogs; the employees' family members went to the workshops to deliver clothes and food to the employees, and also helped transport materials; and those white-haired, retired veteran workers also rushed to the factory to participate in the trial production work.

    Manufacturing a locomotive is not an easy task, and difficulties arose one after another. The drawings were incomplete, so all the technical personnel of the technology department went out of the factory to search for them everywhere. After two days and nights of hard work, they drew the drawings. There were no models, so all the factory's carpenters and model workers gathered together to operate in the open air, working in shifts day and night to rush to make them, and completed more than five hundred new types of parts models within fifteen days.

    Although some small parts had difficulties, the work proceeded relatively smoothly. When it came to making the arc of the new cylinder seat, it was not so easy. To manufacture this arc, a large lathe was required, but this factory did not have such a lathe at all, and using a slotting machine could not achieve the original design precision. What to do? Old worker Jia Fu couldn't eat or sleep because of this matter, and stayed in the workshop late at night, guarding the machine and contemplating. When he returned home, he didn't rest either, drawing and drawing with a pencil. On the fifth day, with the help of technical personnel, he finally successfully researched the slotting machine's arc slotting tool holder, solving the key problem of manufacturing the cylinder seat arc. The boiler shell of the locomotive was a part that this factory had never processed before, but this did not stump the daring and capable workers. They did not know how to process it, so they went to a small boiler factory to learn the operating methods of shell welding, and quickly learned the advanced shell welding method.

    Late at night on May 31st, someone spread the word that they were going outside the factory to fetch materials. Four or five people would have been enough to go, but as a result, more than thirty workers from the furnace yard came. The seven workers in the Luo Xun Labor Area finished their day shift, and the workshop director came to discuss with the foreman about assigning personnel for the next shift. The workers said: "Don't assign anyone, we brought all three meals with us, we'll keep working!" No amount of persuasion could get them to go back, and they worked until dawn the next day, their clothes soaked in sweat. In these twenty-five days and nights, the factory's procurement personnel traveled all over a dozen large and small cities. After getting off the train, they didn't go to hotels or restaurants, but went to the market to buy materials first. If there were materials, they immediately transported them to the station. If there were no materials, they immediately boarded the train and left again.

    People raced against time, not letting go of a single second. June 12th was the date scheduled to install the boiler, but at noon that day, the ash hopper seat and the large ash box suddenly broke down. Each process immediately mobilized urgently. The model workers immediately switched to sand casting, and the dispatching section chief ran back and forth throughout the factory, urging parts to be delivered to each process. But he discovered that he was not urging parts, but chasing parts. When he went to the annealing kiln, the workers told him that it had already been sent to the next process – the forging workshop. When he arrived at the forging workshop, the parts had already been transferred to the parts workshop. He chased to the parts workshop and finally caught up with the parts, finding that they were still hot. The workers fanned them with fans while wrapping the parts in grass paper for processing. Each worker was sweating profusely, and large beads of sweat dripped from their faces. Who had time to wipe the sweat?

    The factory director, the Party committee secretary, and other responsible persons had not left the workshop day and night from the beginning of the locomotive trial production to its success. The enthusiasm of the retired veteran workers was particularly touching. After the news of the preparation for the locomotive trial production spread, dozens of retired veteran workers came to the factory one after another, wanting to participate in the new locomotive manufacturing work. They formed a retired veteran workers' staff department to help the factory guide production. Seventy-one-year-old Qi Kebin came to the factory from Beijing and stayed for two weeks, going to the workshop every day. Sixty-eight-year-old Zhang Shun retired and returned to the countryside to help the agricultural cooperative run a factory, becoming a model agricultural laborer in Beijing. This time, he brought a few heads of garlic and wrapped a few steamed buns, and rushed to the factory. When he arrived at the forging workshop, the workers were trying to use a one-and-a-half-ton steam hammer to replace the three-ton steam hammer to make the tail beam. He put forward suggestions on increasing the steam hammer stroke and improving the bending method, which made the tail beam work proceed particularly smoothly. These older generation workers cared about the cause of their class in this way.

    The successful trial production of the "Construction" type steam locomotive has enabled this factory to enter a new historical era. Let us congratulate this factory with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "February 7th" strike, and write more glorious chapters in future production!

    二十五个日日夜夜
    本报记者
    一台新的“建设”型机车，15日在长辛店机车车辆修理工厂诞生了。从此，这个工厂结束了自建厂六十年来只修理机车不进行制造的历史。人们说，这个曾经掀起了红色风暴的工厂，在大跃进的今天，又在建设上掀起了红色风暴。
      “建设”型机车，是一个上百吨的庞然大物，有几万个零件。两年前修理这样一台机车，也需要二十多天，现在，这个厂的职工，在制车设备极不完备的条件下，却用二十五天的时间试制成功了。
    这是昼夜不分的二十五天。当领导部门的负责人向这个工厂提出制造机车满足国家经济建设需要的问题以后，职工们分析了本厂的设备、技术力量等条件，认为有可能制造机车，但最早今年“十一”才能试制成功。党的总路线公布了，它像一盏明灯，照亮了人们的心，驱散了那些陈腐的观念。于是就下了决心：在“七一”前制成第一台机车，比起“十一”出车来，向前飞跃了三个月。但许多工人说：“不等‘七一’，我们要在6月15日就把它试制成功！”职工们一点也不迟疑，说干就干了起来。本来直接参加机车试制工作的只有一部分人，但全厂职工都关心着它，都想为它贡献自己的一分力量。计划科、会计科的人员不能直接参加试制工作，就帮助整理图纸、编制图纸目录；职工家属们到车间里给职工们送衣送饭，还帮助运料；那些白发苍苍已经退休的老工人，也赶到工厂来参加试制工作。
    制造火车头，并不是那么容易的事，困难一个接着一个。图纸不全，工艺科的全体技术人员走出工厂四处寻找，经过两个昼夜的苦战，就把图纸绘制好了。没有模型，全厂的木工和模型工人就集中起来，在露天下操作，日夜轮流突击赶做，在十五天内就完成了五百多种新型配件的模型。
    一些小的配件虽然有困难，但进行得还算顺利，等到做新制汽缸安座的圆弧时，就不那么容易了。制造这种圆弧，要有大旋床，但是这个工厂根本没有这种旋床，用插床加工又达不到原设计的精密度。怎么办呢？老工人贾福为这件事吃不下饭，睡不着觉，深夜在车间里守着机器沉思，回到家里也不休息，拿着一支铅笔画来画去。到了第五天，在技术人员的帮助下，他终于研究成功了插床插圆弧的刀架，解决了制造汽缸安座圆弧的关键问题，机车锅炉的罐筒是这个工厂从来没有加工过的配件，但这也没难倒敢想敢干的工人们，他们不会加工，就到一家小锅炉厂去学习罐筒焊接的操作方法，很快就学会了先进的罐筒焊接法。
    5月31日深夜，不知是谁传出了要到厂外去拉料的消息，去四、五个人就够了，结果炉场工人就来了三十多个。装罗?领工区的七个工人，干完了白班，车间主任来和领工员商量配备下一班人员，工人们说：“别配了，我们早把三顿饭都带来了，我们接着干！”怎么动员他们也不回去，一直干到第二天黎明，汗水浸湿了他们的衣服。在这二十五个日日夜夜里，工厂的采购人员跑遍了十几个大小城市，下了火车，不进旅馆，也不进饭店，先去市场买材料，有材料，马上就运到车站，没有材料，立即登上火车再走。
    人们和时间竞走，一分一秒也不放过。6月12日是预计要安锅炉的日子，但这天中午灰吊座和大灰箱突然坏了，各个工序立刻紧急动员，模型工立即转去翻砂，调度科长在全厂来回奔走，到各个工序去催部件，但他发现他不是在催部件，而是在追部件，当他到焖火窑去的时候，工人告诉他已送到下道工序——锻工车间，到锻工车间时，部件又已转送到部件车间去了。他追到部件车间，终于赶上了这个部件，发现部件还烫手，工人们一面用扇子给它扇风，一面用草纸包着部件进行加工，工人个个挥汗如雨，豆大的汗珠从脸上一滴滴地往下滴，谁有时间顾得上擦汗呢。
    厂长、党委书记和其他负责人，从开始机车试制到成功，日夜没有离开过车间。退休老工人的热情特别使人感动。在准备试制机车的消息传出后，几十个已经退休的老工人纷纷来到了工厂，要参加新车制造工作，他们组成了退休老工人参谋部，帮助工厂指导生产。七十一岁的齐可斌从北京赶来工厂，住了两个星期，每天到车间去。六十八岁的张顺，退休回农村帮助农业社办工厂，成为北京市的农业劳动模范。这次，他又带着几头大蒜，包了几个馒头，赶来工厂。他到锻工车间时，工人们正在设法用一吨半重的汽锤来代替三吨重的汽锤做尾梁，他就提出了加大汽锤冲程和改进压弯方法的意见，使尾梁工作进行得特别顺利。这些老一代的工人，就是这样关心着本阶级的事业。
    “建设”型蒸汽机车的试制成功，使这个工厂进入了一个新的历史时代。让我们祝贺这个有着“二七”光荣革命传统的工厂，在今后的生产中，写下更辉煌的篇章！
