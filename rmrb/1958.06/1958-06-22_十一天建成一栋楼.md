    A Building Constructed in Eleven Days
    (Xinhua News Agency, 21st) Beijing has seen a four-story building constructed in eleven days. This was built by the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company using a rapid construction method. The building has a total area of 1,767 square meters, and was completed with lights and water in eleven days, ready for use. In the past, it would take this company at least thirty-nine days to build a building of the same size. Preliminary estimates indicate that due to the shortened construction period and reduced management costs, the total cost of this building can be reduced by 20%.

    十一天建成一栋楼
    据新华社21日讯  北京市出现了一座十一天建成的四层楼房。这是北京市第四建筑工程公司采取快速施工法建筑的。这座楼房面积共一千七百六十七平方公尺，施工十一天就做到灯亮水来，交付使用。而过去，这个公司兴建同样面积的一座楼房，最快需要三十九天。初步估算，这座楼房由于工期缩短，管理费用减少，总造价可降低20％。
