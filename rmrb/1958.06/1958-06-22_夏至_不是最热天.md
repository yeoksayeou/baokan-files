"Summer Solstice" is Not the Hottest Day
	Liu Youchun

	There is a saying among the Chinese people: "Cold is at the Third Nine, hot is at the Three Volts." This means that the coldest time of the year is not during the Winter Solstice, but around the Great Cold; the hottest time of the year is not during the Summer Solstice, but around the Great Heat. This saying is very true.

	Today (June 22nd) is the Summer Solstice. From an astronomical point of view, today the sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (i.e., 23.5 degrees north latitude, where Guangzhou, China, is located). The sun's position in the Northern Hemisphere reaches its northernmost point today (i.e., the Tropic of Cancer), making today the longest day and the shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Beijing today, the day is about sixteen hours long, and the night is only eight hours long. After this, the sun gradually moves southward, the length of the day gradually decreases, and the length of the night gradually increases.

	Since the sun is directly overhead on the Summer Solstice, and the radiation is strongest, and also because today is the longest day, the ground absorbs the most solar radiation heat, so the Summer Solstice should be the hottest day of the year, but it is not. The hottest time in China is generally not during the Summer Solstice, but around the Great Heat, a month after the Summer Solstice.

	Why is this?

	The temperature change of the near-surface air layer is not only determined by the amount of solar radiation heat absorbed by the ground, but also by the amount of heat dissipated by the ground (the ability of land, sea, forests, deserts, etc. to absorb and reflect solar radiation is different). In addition, because China is located in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, the changes in the four seasons are relatively obvious. In the half year or so before the Summer Solstice, as the sun moves from south to north, the days gradually lengthen, and the nights gradually shorten, so the ground in the Northern Hemisphere continuously increases heat absorption and reduces heat dissipation, and the ground "stores" a large amount of heat energy. After the Summer Solstice, although the nights begin to lengthen and heat consumption begins to increase, the ground's heat "income" is still greater than its "expenditure," and the temperature continues to rise, reaching its peak around the Great Heat, so it is also the hottest at that time. From China's historical meteorological data, the hottest days generally occur in mid-to-late July. For example, the highest temperature in Beijing on the Summer Solstice is often around 30 degrees Celsius, while the highest temperature in July can reach over 40 degrees Celsius.

	China's summer is not only hot, but also the rainfall is very concentrated, which is extremely beneficial to the growth and development of crops. However, the high temperature in summer also brings some difficulties to certain production departments. Therefore, it is very necessary for relevant units to prepare for cooling and heatstroke prevention as early as possible.

### “夏至”不是最热天

    “夏至”不是最热天
    柳又春
    我国民间有一句谚语：“冷在三九，热在三伏”。是说一年中最冷的时候不在冬至，而在大寒前后；一年中最热的时候不在夏至，而在大暑前后。这句话是很有道理的。
    今天（6月22日）正是夏至。从天文学方面讲，今天太阳直射北回归线（即北纬二十三度半的地方，我国广州约居于此纬度上）。太阳在北半球的位置，今天达到最北点（即北回归线），北半球今天白天最长，夜间最短。譬如北京今天白天长约十六小时，黑夜只有八小时。此后，太阳逐渐南移，昼长渐减，夜长渐增。
    夏至这一天既然太阳当顶直射，辐射最强，同时又因为今天白天最长，所以，地面吸收太阳辐射热量也就最多，那么夏至也就应该是全年最热一天了，其实不然。我国最热的时候，一般都不在夏至，而是在夏至一个月以后的大暑前后。
    这是为什么呢？
    近地面空气层的温度变化，不仅决定于地面吸收太阳辐射热量多少，而且也与地面散失热量多少有关（地面上陆、海、森林、沙漠等吸收、反射太阳辐射的能力是不一样的）。此外，也因为我国位居北半球中纬，一年四季变化比较明显，在夏至以前的半年左右时间里，由于太阳自南向北移动，白天逐渐增长，夜间逐渐减短，所以北半球地面吸热不断增加，散热愈来愈少，地面便“贮蓄”了大量热能。夏至以后，虽然夜间开始增长，耗热开始增多，但是地面热量“收入”仍然多于“支出”，温度继续升高，直到大暑前后达到最高峰，所以也就在那时候最热。从我国历史气象资料来看，最热天一般也都发生在7月中、下旬。譬如北京夏至日最高温度常在摄氏三十度上下，而7月里的最高温度可达摄氏四十度以上。
    我国夏天不但热，而且雨量也很集中，这对农作物的生长、发育是极为有利的，然而夏季高温也给某些生产部门带来一些困难，所以有关单位及早做好降温、防暑的准备工作是十分必要的。
