	Mobilizing the Masses to Implement Measures for Increasing Early Rice Production
	Jiangxi: 100,000 Cadres Go to the Countryside to Promote
	(Our report) In order to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice, an agricultural inspection team composed of 100,000 cadres from Jiangxi Province has been dispatched to various regions to begin work. At present, the 24 million mu of early rice in the province are mostly growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.
	This large-scale agricultural appraisal and inspection movement is based on this foundation to further mobilize the masses to take more and better measures to make the early rice grow even better and make the bumper harvest more reliable. At the same time, through this inspection, we will promote the summer harvest and summer planting work and strive to achieve the annual agricultural leap forward plan.
	The main contents of the inspection and appraisal are the growth of early rice and other crops, field management, preparation for summer harvest and summer planting, as well as issues related to water conservancy, fertilizers, and other production increase measures.
	The Provincial Party Committee requires that in this large-scale mass inspection and appraisal movement, the red flag of the General Line should be planted all over the fields, and the banners of the leap forward and the banners of bumper harvest should be erected on more and wider fields, pushing the province's agricultural production to a new high tide.
	The inspection work will start in mid-June and is expected to end by the end of July. (Li Jiuzhe)

    发动群众做好早稻增产措施
    江西十万干部下乡促进
    本报讯　为争取早稻大丰收，江西省由十万名干部组成的农业检查团已分赴各地开始工作。现在全省二千四百万亩早稻大都生长良好，丰收在望。
    这次大规模的农业评比检查运动，就是在这个基础上进一步发动群众，采取更多更好的措施，使早稻生长得更好，使大丰收更为可靠；同时通过这次检查，推动夏收夏种工作，争取实现全年农业大跃进计划。
    检查评比的主要内容是早稻及其他农作物的生长情况、田间管理情况、夏收夏种准备情况，以及水利、肥料等增产措施方面的问题。
    省委要求，在这次大规模的群众性的检查评比运动中，把总路线的红旗插遍原野，在更多更广的田地上树立起跃进的旗帜、丰收的旗帜，把全省农业生产推向一个新高潮。
    检查工作从6月中旬起，预计到7月底结束。　（李久泽）
