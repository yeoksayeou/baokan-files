Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 8th: The Jinhua Second Agricultural Cooperative in Jianyang County, Sichuan, and the Wusan Agricultural Cooperative in Renshou County, with their soaring enthusiasm and spirit of striving for the top, have created high-yield records for broad beans and peas, shattering the superstition that broad beans and peas have been considered low-yield crops for many years.

This year, the youth production team of the Jinhua Second Agricultural Cooperative planted 1.194 mu of broad beans, with an average yield of 870 jin per mu, an increase of more than eight times compared to last year. The Wusan Agricultural Cooperative planted 14.8 mu of peas, with an average yield of 670 jin per mu.

These two agricultural cooperatives have achieved high yields by boldly breaking superstitions, changing old production methods, and adopting advanced technologies. Starting from land preparation, they changed the sloppy farming habits of the past. The youth production team of Jinhua Second Cooperative implemented deep plowing of eight inches, making the soil loose and fine, and planted early in September when the temperature was higher. When sowing, they implemented dense planting, planting 4,510 nests per mu, which is double the number of ordinary broad bean nests. They also broke the past practice of farmers rarely fertilizing broad beans, applying more than 6,600 jin of fertilizer per mu, which is nearly four times more than the previous amount of fertilizer, and also carried out four weedings and soil loosening. Due to the change in production technology, the broad bean seedlings emerged quickly and took root deeply, enabling the bean stalks to absorb sufficient nutrients and water. These broad beans tillered quickly and abundantly during the growth period, with numerous pods, and the number of pods per plant was twice as many as in previous years. The youth production team also created a method of topping the broad beans, controlling the barren flowers at the top from consuming nutrients, so that the seeds could develop large and full. In addition to implementing timely sowing, applying more fertilizer, and selecting improved varieties, Wusan Cooperative also thickened the soil layer of the cultivated land in advance.

Broad beans and peas are one of the main food crops in Sichuan Province, but the yield per mu is only more than 100 jin, and farmers have always considered them to be low-yield crops. Because of the low yield, farmers do not pay attention to the production of broad beans and peas. In order to completely break the superstition, the agricultural department of Sichuan Province is preparing to promote the increased production experience of these two cooperatives throughout the province.

### 蚕豆豌豆也不是低产作物  四川两个农业社已经做出榜样

　　蚕豆豌豆也不是低产作物
    四川两个农业社已经做出榜样
    据新华社成都8日电　四川简阳县进化第二农业社和仁寿县五三农业社，以鼓足干劲，力争上游的气魄，创造了蚕豆和豌豆的高额丰产纪录，破除了多少年来人们认为蚕豆、豌豆是低产作物的迷信。
    进化第二农业社青年生产队，今年种植蚕豆一亩九分四厘，平均亩产八百七十斤，比去年增产八倍以上；五三农业社种植豌豆十四亩八分，平均亩产六百七十斤。
    这两个农业社由于大胆破除迷信，改变了旧有的生产方法，采用了先进技术，获得了高额丰产。从整理耕地开始，他们就改变了往年耕作粗放的习惯。进化二社青年生产队实行深耕八寸，把泥土整得又松又细，并提早在9月间气温较高的时节播种。在播种时实行密植，每亩种四千五百一十窝，比一般蚕豆窝数增加一倍。他们还打破过去农民对蚕豆很少施肥的常规，每亩施肥六千六百多斤，比过去施肥量增加近四倍，同时又进行了四次除草松土。由于改变了生产技术，因而蚕豆幼苗出土快，扎根深，使豆秆能吸收充分的养料和水分。这些蚕豆在生长期中分蘖快而多，结荚累累，每颗的荚数比往年多一倍。青年生产队还创造了蚕豆打尖的方法，控制了顶部不孕花不消耗养分，使籽粒结得大而饱满。五三社除实行适时播种、多施肥料、选用良种外，还在事先将耕地的土层加厚。
    蚕豆和豌豆是四川省主要粮食作物之一，但每亩产量只有一百多斤，一直被农民认为是低产作物。因为产量低，农民便对蚕豆豌豆生产不重视。为了彻底破除迷信，四川省农业部门准备在全省范围内推广这两个社的增产经验。
