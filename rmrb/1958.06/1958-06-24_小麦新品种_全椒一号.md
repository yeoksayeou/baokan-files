    New Wheat Variety - "Quanjiao No. 1"
    The members of the Nanping Agricultural Cooperative in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, have cultivated a new wheat variety, "Quanjiao No. 1," this year. This wheat has high yield, good quality, and strong adaptability, with a yield more than double that of local wheat.
    "Quanjiao No. 1" wheat is three to four feet tall, with spikes two and a half to three inches long. Each spike has thirteen to eighteen spikelets, with twenty-six to thirty-six grains per spike. The grains are full and the flour yield is as high as 90%. It is awnless, with strong stems and is resistant to fertilizer. This year, the cooperative planted "2905" wheat and "Quanjiao No. 1" in land with the same soil and fertilizer conditions. As a result, "2905" wheat lodged, while "Quanjiao No. 1" wheat remained standing. Last winter, "Quanjiao No. 1" showed vigorous growth, but it was not damaged by frost when the temperature dropped. This spring, when wheat rust and scab occurred, "2905" wheat was severely affected, while "Quanjiao No. 1" was only lightly infected. In 1956, when wheat rust occurred, "Quanjiao No. 1" was not infected.
    Since 1953, the Nanping Cooperative introduced this wheat variety. It did not grow well at the time. However, due to the cooperative's continuous selection and cultivation over the years, this wheat has now become the most adaptable wheat variety in the local area. The Quanjiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this variety and has named it "Quanjiao No. 1."

### 小麦新品种——“全椒一号”

    小麦新品种——“全椒一号”
    安徽全椒县南屏农业社的社员们，今年培育出小麦新品种“全椒一号”。这种小麦产量高、品质好、适应性强，比当地小麦增产一倍以上。
    “全椒一号”小麦株高三尺到四尺，穗长两寸半到三寸，每个麦穗上还有十三个到十八个小穗，每穗有二十六粒到三十六粒，籽粒饱满，出粉率高达90％。无芒、茎秆坚硬、耐肥。今年社里将“二九○五”小麦和“全椒一号”，种在土质、肥料条件相同的地里，结果“二九○五”小麦发生倒伏，而“全椒一号”小麦则屹立不动。去年冬季“全椒一号”有旺苗现象，但气温下降时，却没有受冻害；今春小麦生锈病和赤霉病时，“二九○五”小麦受害较重，而“全椒一号”感染很轻；1956年小麦发生锈病时，“全椒一号”没有发生感染。
    从1953年起，南屏社引进了这种小麦种，当时生长并不好，由于该社几年来不断选种和培育，现在这种小麦成了当地适应性最强的一种小麦。中共全椒县委非常重视这个品种，把它命名为“全椒一号”。
