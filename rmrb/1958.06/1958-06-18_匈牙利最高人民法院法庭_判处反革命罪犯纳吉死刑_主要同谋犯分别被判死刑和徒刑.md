Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 17th: According to reports in newspapers here today, Hungarian judicial authorities have concluded the trial of Nagy Imre and his accomplices' counter-revolutionary armed rebellion leadership group case. Based on the indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and extensive material and human evidence, the People's Court of the Hungarian Supreme Court confirmed the counter-revolutionary crimes of Nagy Imre and others, sentenced Nagy Imre to death, and sentenced his eight accomplices to death and imprisonment respectively.

In its indictment, the Hungarian Supreme People's Procuratorate accused Nagy Imre and his accomplices, Donáth Ferenc, Gimes Miklós, Tildy Zoltán, Maléter Pál, Kopácsi Sándor, Szilágyi József, Jánosi Ferenc, and Vásárhelyi Miklós, of organizing crimes to subvert the Hungarian People's Democratic state system. In addition, Nagy Imre was accused of treason, and Kopácsi Sándor and Maléter Pál of military rebellion. In the criminal case of Nagy Imre and his accomplices, the People's Court of the Supreme Court, based on the defendants' confessions, heard the testimonies of twenty-nine witnesses, listened to the prosecution and defense, and investigated extensive evidence, confirming that Nagy Imre and his closest henchmen, Losonczy Géza, Donáth Ferenc, Gimes Miklós, and Szilágyi József, conducted secret treasonous activities as early as December 1955 in order to seize power by violence and overthrow the Hungarian People's Republic. The People's Court of the Supreme Court confirmed during the trial that Nagy Imre and his accomplices played a leading role in preparing and launching the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956; Tildy Zoltán and Maléter Pál recognized the counter-revolutionary goals of Nagy and his accomplices in October 1956, agreed with these goals, and actively participated in the counter-revolutionary rebellion. These rebellious groups stood at the forefront of domestic reactionary forces in Hungary and colluded with foreign imperialist elements to carry out a coup aimed at overthrowing the Hungarian People's Republic.

As a result of the trial, the People's Court of the Supreme Court sentenced Nagy Imre, Gimes Miklós, Maléter Pál, and Szilágyi József to death, Kopácsi Sándor to life imprisonment, Donáth Ferenc to twelve years imprisonment, Jánosi Ferenc to eight years imprisonment, Tildy Zoltán to six years imprisonment, and Vásárhelyi Miklós to five years imprisonment.

Since the counter-revolutionary criminal Losonczy Géza had already died of illness, the Supreme Procuratorate withdrew the criminal prosecution against him.

The death sentences have been carried out.
