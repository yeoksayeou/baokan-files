    Uphold the General Line as the Guiding Principle and Launch a New Upsurge in the Rectification Campaign
    Hebei Prefecture and City Party Committee Conference Examines Rectification Work
    (Our Report) This reporter Zhang Hua and Gu Kedong report: The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a conference of prefecture and city Party committee secretaries and heads of propaganda and cultural education departments. In accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the conference examined rectification work and determined to uphold the general line of socialist construction as the guiding principle, launching a new upsurge in the rectification campaign.
    At present, the Hebei Province's government organs' rectification is gradually entering the stage of ideological examination. However, the development of the movement is uneven, and many units' rectification is not deep or thorough enough, with 10% of units still lagging behind. It is worth noting that, with the great victory achieved in the rectification and the emergence of a great leap forward in work, complacency and relaxation are quite widespread, with attempts to hastily conclude the campaign. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized this sentiment, determining to uphold the general line as the guiding principle and launch a new upsurge in the rectification campaign involving the entire Party and the entire people. It is necessary to organize a million-strong army to vigorously publicize and implement the general line, mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to carry out a mass ideological work review based on the spirit of the general line, launching an upsurge of greater scale in airing views freely, big-character posters, and great debates than in the past, striving for a complete victory in the rectification movement.
    Based on the spirit of the general line, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward four requirements for the province's rectification: 1. All cadres must have a profound understanding and comprehension of the general line. Ideologies and works should be reviewed in accordance with the general line. Those in line with the spirit of the general line should be summarized and promoted to implement the general line in all aspects of practical work. Those not in line with the general line should be criticized and corrected. 2. Emancipate the mind, break down superstitions, establish a bold and creative working style, and realize a great leap forward in work. 3. Master the correct methods for handling contradictions among the people, and adjust the relationship between leaders and the masses. 4. Change thinking and working methods, respect materialism, dialectics, and the mass line.

    以总路线为纲掀起整风新高潮
    河北地市委书记会议检查整风工作
    本报讯　记者张华、谷克东报道：中共河北省委近日召开地、市委书记和宣传、文教部长会议，根据党的“八大”二次会议精神检查整风，确定以社会主义建设总路线为纲，掀起新的整风高潮。
    目前河北省机关整风，已逐步转入思想检查的阶段。但是运动发展是不平衡的，有不少单位整风不够深透，而且还有10％的落后单位。值得注意的是，在整风取得巨大胜利、工作出现大跃进的情况下，较普遍地出现了自满和松劲情绪，企图草率收兵。中共河北省委批判了这种情绪，确定以总路线为纲，掀起全党全民整风的新高潮。要组织百万大军，大张旗鼓地宣传贯彻总路线，发动全党全民根据总路线精神，开展一个群众性的思想工作大检查，掀起一个比过去规模更大的大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的高潮，争取整风运动全胜。
    中共河北省委根据总路线的精神，对全省的整风提出四项要求：一、所有干部对总路线有深刻的认识和理解。根据总路线检查思想和工作，合乎总路线精神的，要总结经验，加以发扬，把总路线贯彻到各方面的实际工作中去；不合乎总路线的要批判纠正。二、解放思想、破除迷信，树立大胆独创的工作作风，实现工作大跃进。三、掌握正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，调整领导与群众的关系。四、改变思想和工作方法，尊重唯物论辩证法和群众路线。
