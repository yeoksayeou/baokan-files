    Grass Bricks and Grass Cakes: A Method of Utilizing Wild Green Manure
    The abundant grasses and leaves in the mountainous areas of Anhui are good raw materials for making compost and green manure. According to the practice of the Dingdong Agricultural Cooperative in Dingyuan County of this province, well-rotted grasses and leaves can be made into grass bricks and grass cakes that are easy to transport to other places. The fertilizer effect of these grass bricks and grass cakes is very good; four dan [approximately 400 lbs] can be equivalent to one dan of soybean cake.
    The method of making grass cakes is as follows: harvest green grass and leaves, then pile them up to rot. When the green grass and leaves are fermented to the point of being sticky and can be formed into a ball by hand, tofu dregs, sugar dregs, or distiller's grains can be used to press them into grass cakes, or a mud brick mold can be used to make grass bricks. Repeated experiments have proved that making bricks is better than making cakes. Its advantages are: one person can operate it, it is faster to make, smaller in size, easier to dry, and does not lose fertilizer juice.

    草砖和草饼利用野生绿肥的一种方法
    安徽山区盛产的青草和树叶，是制造堆肥、绿肥的好原料。根据这个省定远县定东农业社实践证明，经过腐熟的青草、树叶，可以制成便于运输外地的草砖、草饼。这种草砖、草饼的肥效很好，四担可抵一担豆饼。
    制草饼的方法是：收割青草、树叶，然后堆积腐烂，当青草、树叶沤得发粘，手握成团的时候，就可以用豆腐渣、糖渣或糟渣压榨成草饼或者用打土坯的模子制成草砖。经过多次试验证明，制砖的方法比制饼好。它的好处在于：一个人可以操作，制的快，体积小、易干，不流失肥料汁液。
