Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 19th: According to the calls of the French Communist Party, the French National Anti-Fascist Committee, the French General Confederation of Labor, and other democratic groups, a national day to oppose the establishment of a personal dictatorship and defend the republican system was held across France on June 18th. On this day, grand demonstrations were held throughout the country as a counterattack against the demonstrations planned by fascists for the same day.

In Paris, students in the Latin Quarter, united like brothers, held demonstrations. In factories and labor exchanges that had become fortresses of freedom, on squares, and in the ranks of marches, socialists, communists, and radicals demonstrated side by side. Former guerrilla fighters and former Free French armed forces fighters joined their ranks, ignoring the ranks of rioters.

De Gaulle himself participated in an anti-republican system "demonstration" organized in the name of commemorating the eighteenth anniversary of his speech resisting Hitler's occupation. Fascists also tried to disrupt the demonstrations of republican forces. In Breuvannes, a fascist parliamentarian, Becq, attempted to hold a public gathering but was immediately countered by republicans. They shouted slogans such as "Fascism must not succeed!" and "Long live the Republic!" Becq was unable to speak and had to flee in embarrassment amidst the jeers of the crowd.

In many enterprises and on construction sites, strikes were held. De Gaulle had issued instructions to the prefects and police authorities to prohibit demonstrations, but the workers rose up in resistance and finally achieved victory.

Anti-fascist rallies and demonstrations were also held in other parts of France.

Ajaccio, Corsica, also held a traditional demonstration on the 17th under the slogan of defending the Republic, commemorating two local patriots who sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the Hitlerite occupiers.

    保卫民主　反对个人独裁
    法国各地举行大示威
    据新华社巴黎19日电　根据法国共产党、法国全国反法西斯委员会、法国总工会和其他民主团体的号召，法国全国各地在6月18日举行了反对建立个人独裁和保卫共和制度的民族日。这一天，全国各地举行了盛大的示威游行，作为对法西斯分子预定在同一天举行的示威的反击。
    在巴黎，大学生们在拉丁区亲如兄弟团结一致，举行示威。在变成了自由堡垒的各工厂和劳动介绍所，在广场上以及在游行的行列里，社会党人、共产党人和激进党人并肩示威。前游击队战士以及前自由法兰西武装力量战士，参加了他们的行列，而不理睬暴乱分子的队伍。
    戴高乐本人参加了在纪念他发表反抗希特勒占领的演说十八周年的名义下组织的反共和制度“示威”。法西斯分子还力图破坏共和力量的示威。在布勒瓦，一名法西斯议员贝斯克试图举行公开集会，但是立即遭到共和人士的反击。他们高呼不能让法西斯主义得逞、共和国万岁等口号。贝斯克无法讲话，不得不在群众嘲骂下狼狈逃跑。
    在许多企业中，在建筑工地上，都举行了罢工。戴高乐曾经向省长们和警察当局发出指示，禁止示威游行，但是劳动者们起来反抗，终于取得胜利。
    在法国其他各地也都举行了反法西斯集会和示威游行。
    科西嘉岛的阿雅克济城17日也在保卫共和的口号下举行了传统的示威游行，纪念当地两个在反希特勒占领者斗争中牺牲的爱国者。”
