　　Tibetan Children Should Be Good Students of Chairman Mao
    More Than 1,500 Children Wear Red Scarves
    (Our dispatch) On the Tibetan Plateau, more than 1,500 children have already worn red scarves, and thousands more are enjoying their studies in schools across Tibet.

    "Always remember the kindness of Chairman Mao and be his good students!" Many children in Tibet expressed this determination on the eve of Children's Day on June 1st. Two years ago, Deputy Premier Chen Yi, head of the central delegation, brought gifts from Chairman Mao to the children from Beijing. Many children in Lhasa still remember two sentences Deputy Premier Chen Yi said when he met with them: "On behalf of Chairman Mao, I send my regards to you. You are all the future masters of the country." Deputy Premier Chen also presented the children with many experimental instruments, books, musical instruments, toys, and various souvenirs on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. Over the past two years, these gifts have been used and enjoyed by thousands of children in rotation. The children deeply feel Chairman Mao's care for them. Over the past few years, the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also been constantly concerned about the growth of the children.

    The Young Pioneers in Lhasa recently received a letter from the Young Pioneers of Shanghai Hangzhou Road No. 1 Primary School. The letter said that they would use practical actions to eliminate failing grades as a gift for this year's "June 1st". The letter also said that they often use their spare time to go to factories and rural areas to help workers and farmers with their labor, and their lives are very happy. The children in Tibet were extremely happy to see this letter. These days, the Young Pioneers of Lhasa primary schools are all saying that they must learn the good habits of their Shanghai friends in loving learning and loving labor. Most of the members in Lhasa have very good grades and are gradually developing the habit of loving labor. This spring, the 327 members of Lhasa No. 2 Primary School planted more than 1,000 saplings on campus with their teachers, and these saplings have now grown green leaves. (Guo Chaoren)

　　西藏儿童要做毛主席的好学生
    有一千五百多个孩子戴上了红领巾
    本报讯　西藏高原已有一千五百多个孩子戴上了红领巾，还有数千名孩子，正在西藏各地的学校里过着愉快的学习生活。
    “永远记住毛主席的恩情，做他老人家的好学生！”在“六一”儿童节的前夕，西藏许多孩子都表示了这样的决心。两年前，中央代表团团长陈毅副总理从北京带来了毛主席给孩子们的礼物。拉萨市的许多孩子们今天还记得陈毅副总理和他们会面时的两句话：“代表毛主席问你们好，你们都是国家未来的主人翁。”陈副总理还代表毛主席和中央人民政府送给孩子们许多实验仪器、图书、乐器、玩具和各种纪念品。两年来，这些礼物被几千名孩子轮流使用过、欣赏过。孩子们深深感到毛主席对他们的关怀。几年来，中共西藏工委也无时无刻不在关心着孩子们的成长。
    拉萨市的少先队员们最近收到上海杭州路第一小学的少先队员们写来的一封信。来信说，他们要用消灭功课不及格的实际行动，作为今年“六一”的献礼。信中还说，他们常利用课外时间到工厂、农村去帮助工人、农民叔叔们劳动，生活很愉快。西藏的孩子们看到这封信，高兴极了。这几天，拉萨市小学的队员们都说一定要学习上海朋友爱学习、爱劳动的好习惯。拉萨的大部分队员学习成绩都很好，并且逐步养成爱劳动的习惯。拉萨第二小学的三百二十七个队员在今年春天和老师一道在校园里栽了一千多棵树苗，这些树苗现在都长出了绿叶。　（郭超人）
