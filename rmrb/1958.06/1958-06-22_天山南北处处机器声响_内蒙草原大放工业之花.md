    According to Xinjiang Daily: In just a few months, a wave of developing local industries has emerged in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the roar of machines is heard everywhere north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.

    Since March, under the personal leadership of Party committees at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, all positive factors have been mobilized among the masses to develop local industries. The Aksu area has stirred up the enthusiasm of the whole people to invest in building factories. Many members of the Communist Youth League and young people are participating in various forms of labor in their spare time, investing their labor income in developing industry. In Aktau County, Kizilsu Autonomous Prefecture, the masses in just thirteen townships have automatically invested more than 464,000 yuan. The masses in the second district of Wuqia County, located on the Pamir Plateau, are very enthusiastic about developing industry, with more than 40 district and township cadres taking the lead in investing 12,000 yuan. The eighth township of the Cele District in Cele County has set up an artificial fertilizer factory through their own efforts. Herdsmen in the first district of Wuqia County are enthusiastically reporting mineral deposits, enabling the whole district to initially grasp the location, content, and reserves of 22 minerals such as copper, iron, lead, and zinc within a few days. Four iron and lead mines are now officially being mined.

    The various factories established in various parts of the autonomous region are all aimed at serving agricultural and pastoral production. Most of them are factories for agricultural tool repair and assembly, fertilizer manufacturing, electricity, and agricultural and pastoral product processing. These factories have already had a positive effect on local agricultural production. Four townships in the suburbs of Kashi City have agricultural tool repair and assembly plants, and fourteen agricultural cooperatives have granular fertilizer plants, which have basically solved the problem of agricultural tool repair and fertilizer supply. After the bone fertilizer factory was built in Yining, it immediately signed supply contracts with nearby agricultural cooperatives to meet the needs of farmers for fertilizer. The third agricultural cooperative of the seventh township of the third district of Hotan County has built a hydropower station, which not only supplies lighting for more than 300 cooperative members but also plans to install power machinery to replace some human and animal power.

    Many areas have adopted the policy of "relying on the mountains to eat mountains, relying on the water to eat water, and making use of what is available" when building factories. Many factories have been established on the basis of existing handicrafts, truly achieving small investment, fast speed, and great results. A bone fertilizer factory in Kashi City with an annual output of more than 100 tons was built without spending a penny. The raw material—bones—was also donated by the masses. The complete set of equipment for the Yining Bone Fertilizer Factory was also pieced together from old oil drums and old steel pipes. In order to rapidly promote the development of local industries, the Autonomous Region Construction Committee, the Industry Department, the Water Conservancy Department, the Engineering Department of the Production and Construction Corps, and the Geological Bureau have provided strong support to the townships and cooperatives in setting up factories and mines in terms of surveying, design, technical equipment, and technical forces.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 21st: In the vast pastoral areas, rural areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and desert areas of Inner Mongolia, industrial flowers are blooming everywhere, and setting up factories and mining is like a stampede of ten thousand horses.

    Zhaowuda League, which has always been at the forefront of developing local industries in the autonomous region, has already built and put into production 67 banner and county factories and mines and more than 1,100 township and cooperative factories and mines in April and May. Under the strengthened specific leadership of Party committees at all levels, the speed of industrial construction in this semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral, multi-ethnic area has been further accelerated. In early June, the league built more than 2,600 small factories and mines, of which Chifeng County has become a "thousand-factory county." At present, the Zhaowuda League Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward a new fighting slogan, organized a propaganda army to go deep into rural and pastoral areas to vigorously publicize the general line, and organized industrial, agricultural, and pastoral inspection groups to conduct comprehensive evaluations in various banners and counties to promote the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    Bayannur League, located in the desert area with a very weak industrial foundation, was inspired by the success of the Party Committee Secretary of Alxa Banner in helping herdsmen trial-produce milk powder manufacturing equipment. The enthusiasm of Mongolian herdsmen to set up factories has been stimulated. They are building small mobile dairy factories on the Gobi grasslands. In the past few days, various parts of Bayannur League have transferred a group of cadres to Baotou and other places to learn technology, preparing to establish salt electrolysis, power generation, wool textile, iron smelting, agricultural tool repair, and papermaking factories, as well as mining mica, asbestos, tin, lead, crystal, and other minerals throughout the league.

    In the vast grasslands and rural areas of Hulunbuir, Xilin Gol, Jerim, Chahar, and Ikzhao Leagues, a fervent scene of developing industries has also emerged. In the famous sand dune area of Inner Mongolia—the Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner of the Jerim League—120,000 Mongolian farmers and herdsmen are united and cooperating with local Han, Korean, Manchu, Hui, and other ethnic farmers, carrying out the work of transforming deserts and depressions, and actively preparing to develop industry. They are determined to build 1,440 factories and mines within this year, with an average of two or three small factories for each agricultural and pastoral cooperative. After the Chahar League expanded the planting area of ​​potatoes, in order to adapt to the surge in potato production, various banner, county, township, and cooperative units are preparing to set up hundreds of medium and small-sized starch factories. The cadres of all ethnic groups in the Evenk Autonomous Banner, which is under construction, have also decided to lead the herdsmen to set up 50 small factories before October after studying the general line.

    天山南北处处机器声响
    内蒙草原大放工业之花
    本报讯  据新疆日报消息：在短短几个月内，新疆维吾尔自治区出现了大办地方工业的热潮，天山南北到处传出了机器的轰鸣声。
    从3月份开始，新疆维吾尔自治区各地在党委亲自领导下，调动群众的一切积极因素，动手大办地方工业。阿克苏专区鼓起了全民投资办工厂的热情，许多共青团员和青年利用业余时间参加各种劳动，把劳动所得的报酬投入办工业。克孜勒苏自治州的阿克陶县，仅十三个乡的群众，就自动投资四十六万四千多元。远在帕米尔高原上的乌恰县二区的群众办工业的劲头很足，四十多名区乡干部就带头投资一万二千元。策勒县策勒区八乡三个社自己动手办起了人工肥料厂。乌恰县一区的牧民踊跃报矿，使全区在几天之内就初步掌握了铜、铁、铅、锌等二十二个矿的位置、含量和藏量，现在已有四个铁矿和铅矿正式开采。
    自治区各地兴办的各种工厂，都以服务农牧业生产为目的。其中大部分为农具修配、肥料制造、电力和农牧业产品加工等工厂。这些工厂已经对当地农业生产发生了良好的作用。喀什市郊区的四个乡都有了农具修配厂，十四个农业社都有了颗粒肥料厂，基本上解决了农具修配和肥料供应问题。伊宁建成了骨肥厂后，立即和附近的农业社订立了供应合同，以满足农民对肥料的需要。和阗县三区七乡第三农业社建成了水电站，不仅供应三百多户社员照明，而且准备安装动力机械，来代替一部分人力和畜力。
    许多地区在办工厂时，采取了靠山吃山、靠水吃水、因陋就简的方针。许多厂都是在原有手工业的基础上建立起来的，真正做到了投资小、速度快、收效大。喀什市的一座年产一百多吨的骨肥厂，没有另花一分钱就建立起来了，原料——骨头也是发动群众捐献的。伊宁骨肥厂的整套设备也是用旧油桶和旧钢管等拼凑而成的。为了迅速促进地方工业的发展，自治区建设委员会、工业厅、水利厅、兵团工程处、地质局等部门，分别从勘查设计、技术设备、技术力量等方面，给予了办厂开矿的乡社以有力的支援。
    新华社呼和浩特21日电  在内蒙古辽阔的牧区、农村、半农半牧区和沙漠地带，工业之花遍地盛开，办厂采矿势如万马奔腾。
    在发展自治区地方工业中一直走在前面的昭乌达盟，4、5月份建成投入生产的已有六十七座旗县厂矿和一千一百多座乡社厂矿。在各级党委加强具体领导下，这个半农半牧、民族杂居的地区的工业建设速度进一步加快，6月上旬全盟又建成了二千六百多个小型厂矿，其中赤峰县已成为“千厂县”。目前，中共昭乌达盟委员会又提出新的战斗口号，组织宣传大军深入农村牧区大张旗鼓宣传总路线，并组织工农牧业检查团到各旗县展开全面评比，促进工业和农牧业大跃进。
    原来工业基础很薄弱的位于沙漠地带的巴彦淖尔盟，在中共阿拉善旗旗委书记帮助牧民试制奶粉制造器成功后，蒙古族牧民办工厂的劲头被鼓起来了，他们正在戈壁草原上建设流动生产的小型乳品厂。这几天，巴彦淖尔盟各地已抽调一批干部到包头等地学习技术，准备在全盟创办食盐电解、发电、毛纺织、炼铁、农具修配、造纸等厂，和开采云母、石棉、锡、铅、水晶等矿。
    在呼伦贝尔、锡林郭勒、哲里木、察哈尔、伊克昭等盟的广大草原和农村中，也出现了大办工业的热烈景象。内蒙古著名的沙丘地带——哲里木盟科尔沁左翼后旗，十二万蒙古族农牧民和当地汉、朝鲜、满、回等民族农民团结合作，一面进行着改造沙漠、洼地的工作，一面积极准备兴办工业。他们决心在今年内建起一千四百四十座厂矿，平均每一农牧业社有两三个小工厂。察哈尔盟扩大马铃薯种植面积以后，为适应马铃薯产量的激增，各旗县乡社正在筹办几百座中小型淀粉厂。正在筹建中的鄂温克族自治旗的各族干部，学习总路线以后，也决定带动牧民在10月份以前办起五十座小型工厂。
