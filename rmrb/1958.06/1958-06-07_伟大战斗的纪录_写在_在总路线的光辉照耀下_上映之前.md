    A Record of a Great Battle
　　--Written Before the Release of "Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line"
　　Wang Xixi
    Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the people of the whole country have actively responded to the call of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and embarked on the path of socialist construction. First, more than 500 million farmers and workers have, for more than half a year, plunged into a great battle with overwhelming momentum. They want rivers to make way and mountains to bow their heads. They want to innovate, innovate, and innovate again; create, create, and create again! They have made half a year surpass three thousand years. They dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act! The wisdom of the masses has been liberated, and the "atomic explosion" of the laboring people's strength has occurred. This is truly an unprecedented and fierce battle! A great and courageous battle!
    The recently released film "Under the Brilliant Illumination of the General Line" is a true record of this great battle. Five short films, with representative facts, profoundly and specifically illustrate the infinitely rich content and infinite power of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results." "Ten Thousand Horses Galloping," "Splitting Mountains to Divert Water," and "The Scent of Wheat Extends for Miles, Celebrating a Bumper Harvest" are battle reports from the agricultural front, and "Striving to Go Upstream" and "A Factory Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results" are battle reports from the industrial front. From these films, we can see the peasants from the south of the Yangtze River, the Central Plains, to the Northwest, forming an irresistible force with their dauntless spirit, transforming nature, resisting and preventing natural disasters, striving for abundant agricultural harvests, wanting the heavens to obey man, and nature to obey man. They, the peasants, want to truly become the masters of the land and the masters of nature. They want the mountains to change, the land to change, the rivers to change, and the farmland to change, to become servants tamed by them. From the films, we can also see the workers from Shanghai to Chongqing, all under the slogans of "Catching up with Britain in Fifteen Years" and "Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results, Striving to Go Upstream," tapping potential, practicing diligence and thrift, and inventing and creating. In Shanghai, twenty-five kinds of products have surpassed Britain. In Chongqing, some production outputs have increased dozens of times. They, the workers, want to change machinery and equipment, reform technology, improve product quality, and build the motherland, which is still very backward in industry, into a powerful industrial country, surpassing capitalist Britain. The film illustrates that the liberated Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have changed, changed. They have become more courageous people, more intelligent people, and people with more infinite strength. They have noble styles, lofty ideals, and resolute actions. Therefore, from these films, we can gain strength, gain encouragement, and gain guidance for action.
    These films are all relatively successful, containing the efforts of newsreel filmmakers, but more importantly, it is due to this great era. Workers and peasants, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, created this era and also created the films, and our newsreel filmmakers only faithfully recorded a part of this great era. Our newsreel filmmakers have made many contributions in recording work, especially the directors in the filming process, trying to highlight the power and ideological activities of the people, and in the editing process, trying to clarify the theme, with a clear and smooth structure. In the narration, they also tried to select a part of folk songs, which are all efforts to create a new style of newsreel film. We must continue to move forward in the future and boldly try in practice.

    伟大战斗的纪录
　　——写在“在总路线的光辉照耀下”上映之前
　　王?西
    在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民都积极响应党的“八大”二次会议的号召，开始了社会主义建设的行动。首先是五亿多的农民和工人，半年多来，他们已经以排山倒海之势，投入了伟大的战斗，他们要：江河让路，高山低头；他们要革新革新再革新，创造创造再创造！他们已经使半年超过三千年，他们敢想、敢说、敢干！群众的智慧解放了，劳动人民力量的“原子爆炸”了。这真是一场空前的剧烈的战斗！伟大勇猛的战斗！
    最近上映的影片“在总路线的光辉照耀下”就是这个伟大的战斗的真实纪录。五个短片正以代表性的事实，深刻具体说明了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省”的无限丰富的内容和无穷的力量。“万马奔腾”、“劈山引水”、“麦香千里喜丰收”是从农业战线上来的战报，“力争上游”、“一个多快好省的工厂”是从工业战线上来的战报。从这些影片中，可以看到从江南、中原到西北的农民，他们以大无畏的精神形成不可抵御的力量，改造自然，抵抗和防止自然灾害，要农产丰收，要天服从人，要自然服从人，他们，农民们，要真正成为土地的主人，自然的主宰，要山变、要地变、要江河变、要农田变，变成为他们所驯服的仆役。从影片中也可以看到从上海到重庆的工人，他们都在“十五年赶上英国”、“多快好省、力争上游”的口号下，发挥潜力，勤俭节约，发明创造。在上海就有二十五种产品超过英国；在重庆有些生产产量增加数十倍。他们，工人们，要改变机器设备，改革技术，改善产品质量，要使在工业方面还很落后的祖国，建设成为强大的工业国家，超过资本主义的英国。影片说明了：解放了的中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，变了，变了。变成了更勇敢的人们，更有智慧的人们，更有无限力量的人们了。他们有高尚的风格、远大的理想和果敢的行动。因此，从这些影片中我们可以得到力量，得到鼓舞，得到行动的引导。
    这些影片都是比较成功的，其中包涵着新闻纪录电影工作者的努力，但更重要的是由于这个伟大的时代。工人、农民们在党和毛主席的领导下创造了这个时代，也创造了影片，而我们新闻纪录电影工作者只是忠实地纪录下了这个伟大的时代的一部分。我们的新闻纪录电影工作者在纪录工作中作出了很多的贡献，特别是导演在拍摄过程中尽量突出表现人们的力量和思想活动，在编辑过程中尽量明确主题思想，结构爽朗、流畅，在解说中也尝试选用了一部分民歌，这些都是企图创造新闻纪录电影的新风格所作的努力。以后还要继续前进，在实践中去大胆尝试。
