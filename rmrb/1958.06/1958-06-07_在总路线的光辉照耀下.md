The film "Under the Glorious Illumination of the General Line," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, includes the following five short films:

	"Striving for the Best" is a documentary of the countless miracles created by the working class of Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward. The working class of Shanghai is responding to the Party's call to "catch up with Britain in fifteen years" with practical actions: many factory directors, Party committee secretaries, chief engineers, and workers are working together to tackle technical fortresses; the workers' bold innovations in technology have multiplied production several times over. Heroes and heroic deeds are everywhere!

	"A Factory with More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results" This is the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. The factory's workshops have the most modern equipment, but the buildings of the factory's management organization are very simple, just some low thatched houses. The factory director not only insisted on running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, but he himself is also a very thrifty person. He gave the factory's only few楼房 dormitory buildings to the worker comrades to live in, but he himself lives in two thatched houses. The film also shows some of the factory's advanced innovations in the midst of the Leap Forward.

	"Splitting Mountains to Divert Water" Wushan County, Gansu Province, is full of tall loess mountains, and soil erosion is serious. In order to completely solve the water problem and turn the poor mountains into rich mountains, the Party led the people of Wushan County to do something that no one had ever done before:
	"Splitting mountains to open canals and diverting water up the mountains."
	Despite the thousands of difficulties, the people have the leadership of the Party, endless wisdom, and a fearless spirit. After more than three months of hard work, they finally diverted water up the mountain and turned more than 100,000 mu of arid land into paddy fields.

	"Ten Thousand Horses Galloping" In the era of the motherland's leap forward, Changshu County, like all parts of the country, has produced thousands of heroes.
	Sui Xingchu, Secretary of the CPC Changshu County Committee, made a resounding call to the people of the county at a rally of ten thousand people: "Cotton exceeds Macheng, rice and wheat exceed Xiaogan, government offices move to the countryside, and leaders learn from Hongan."
	After a hard battle, more than 10,000 li of dried river channels in Changshu County were completed, and more than 140 million dan of river mud were excavated; the third-class wheat was also transformed into first-class wheat according to the people's will.

	"Wheat Fragrance Travels Thousands of Miles, Celebrating a Bumper Harvest" Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, is mostly hilly and mountainous, and has historically been a well-known area with few people, much land, and low grain production. However, in the sound of the號角 agricultural Great Leap Forward, it has created a miracle of high-yield wheat production over a large area. Even an old member of the Dongsheng Cooperative in Gucheng County couldn't help but sing a mountain song when he saw the golden waves of wheat, praising cooperation and praising the leadership of the Party.

　　“在总路线的光辉照耀下”
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的影片“在总路线的光辉照耀下”，包括如下五部短片：
    “力争上游”是上海工人阶级在大跃进中创造出的无数奇迹的纪实。上海工人阶级正以实际行动响应着党的“十五年赶上英国”的号召：不少厂长、党委书记、总工程师和工人们一起钻研，攻破了技术堡垒；工人们在技术方面的大胆革新使产量翻了几翻。到处是英雄的人物，英雄的事迹！
    “一个多快好省的工厂”这是成都量具刃具工厂。这个厂的车间里有最近代化的设备，可是厂的管理机构的建筑却非常简陋，只是一些矮小的茅屋，厂长不仅坚持了勤俭办企业，而且他自己也是一个非常俭朴的人，他把全厂仅有的几座楼房宿舍给了工人同志住，自己却住在两间草房里。影片也表现了这个厂在跃进中间的一些先进创举。
    “劈山引水”甘肃省武山县到处都是高大的黄土山，水土流失严重，为了彻底解决水的问题，为了把穷山变富山，党领导着武山县的人民做了一件前人从来没做过的事
  “劈山开渠、引水上山。”
    仅管困难千万，人们有党的领导，有无穷无尽的智慧，有天不怕地不怕的勇敢精神，经过三个多月的苦战，终于把水引上了山，把十几万亩干旱的土地变成了水田。
      “万马奔腾”在祖国飞跃的年代里，常熟县就像全国各地一样，涌现出千千万万的英雄。
    中共常熟县委书记隋性初同志在万人誓师大会上向全县人民提出了“棉花超麻城，稻麦超孝感，机关搬下乡，领导学红安”的响亮号召。
    经过了一场苦战，常熟县车干的河道有一万多里长，挖出河泥一亿四千多万担强；三类麦也按照人们的意志，变成了一类麦。
    “麦香千里喜丰收”湖北省襄阳专区是多丘陵和山区地带，在历史上是著名的人少地多的粮食低产区。但是在农业大跃进的号角声中，这里却创造了大面积小麦高额丰产的奇迹。连谷城县东升社的一位老社员看到那一片片金黄色的麦浪时，也禁不住乐得唱起山歌，赞美合作化，颂扬党的领导。
