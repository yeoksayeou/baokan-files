    At today's meeting, Korean Premier Kim Il Sung delivered an important speech on Korea's first Five-Year Plan. Subsequently, all members of the Assembly unanimously passed the decree on the First Five-Year Plan (1957-1961) for the development of the People's Economy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    During the meetings on the 9th and 10th, twenty-four members of the Assembly, including Korean Deputy Premier Kim Il, spoke, unanimously supporting and endorsing the report on the First Five-Year Plan made by Li Jong-ok, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of Korea, on behalf of the Cabinet at the meeting on the 9th.

    The decree on the First Five-Year Plan passed by the meeting stipulates that the basic task of the First Five-Year Plan is to further consolidate the socialist economic foundation of the northern part of the Republic and basically solve the people's problems of food, clothing, and housing. Based on this basic task, it is necessary to firmly lay the foundation for socialist industrialization in order to completely eliminate the colonial nature of industry; to rapidly strengthen and develop light industrial production to provide the people with a variety of consumer goods; and to complete the socialist transformation of agricultural cooperatives and private industrial and commercial enterprises.

    The decree stipulates that in terms of industry, the focus of the First Five-Year Plan will be on developing the construction materials, ferrous metals, machinery manufacturing, and chemical industries; continuing to expand the fuel and power base; and rapidly developing the textile, food industry, and aquaculture. The decree stipulates that the total industrial output value will increase 2.6 times during the Five-Year Plan, with the production of means of production increasing 2.9 times and the production of consumer goods increasing 2.2 times. By 1961, it will be possible to produce 700,000 tons of pig iron, 670,000 tons of steel, more than 1,600 metal cutting machine tools, 10 million tons of coal, 9.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 630,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 2 million tons of cement, 200 million meters of textiles, and 22,000 tons of chemical fibers.

    The decree stipulates that in terms of agriculture, the focus of the First Five-Year Plan will be on developing grain production, while simultaneously rapidly developing cash crop production as well as animal husbandry, fruit tree cultivation, and sericulture; completing agricultural collectivization; correspondingly promoting agricultural technological transformation; and launching a nationwide campaign to build water conservancy projects, irrigation, and soil and water conservation, establishing dryland irrigation systems to create conditions for overcoming droughts and floods. The decree stipulates that 3.76 million tons of grain will be produced by 1961.

    The decree stipulates that during the Five-Year Plan period, the total investment in basic construction in the people's economy and social culture will be 147 billion Korean won, with the investment mainly used for heavy industrial construction, while also being used to vigorously expand housing construction in urban and rural areas.

    The decree stipulates that during the Five-Year Plan period, national income will increase 2.2 times. The actual income of workers and farmers will increase 1.5 times, and the total number of employees in the people's economic sectors will increase to 1.13 million by 1961, an increase of 300,000 compared to 1956.

    After passing the decree on the Five-Year Plan, the meeting, amidst warm applause, passed the draft letter of thanks from the Korean people to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the great Chinese people.

    The meeting then approved several decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly. As Song Bong-yuk had been appointed as Minister of Finance, the meeting decided to relieve him of his position as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and elected Jung Doo-hwan as Chairman of the Budget Committee.

    Since the formulation of the Korean Constitution, Korea's national construction has greatly developed, and some provisions of the Constitution need to be revised and supplemented. The meeting accepted the proposal made by Minister of Justice and Assembly member Heo Jeong-suk and elected a drafting committee for the revision and supplementation of the Constitution, headed by Kim Il.
