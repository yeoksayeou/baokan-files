Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: Starting July 1st, airplane fares on domestic civil aviation routes will be generally reduced, with an average reduction of 40%.

The principle behind this fare reduction is: passenger fares will be reduced more significantly for flights to regions not served by railways, or to remote border areas in the Northwest and Southwest where transportation is inconvenient. For some routes, fares will be reduced by almost half. The price reduction will be slightly smaller for flights to areas served by railways. To strengthen the connection between China's three largest cities, the price of plane tickets from Beijing to Shanghai and Beijing to Guangzhou will also be reduced more significantly.

After the fare reduction, the price of a plane ticket from Beijing to Shanghai will decrease from 128 yuan to 96 yuan, from Beijing to Guangzhou from 235 yuan to 158 yuan, from Beijing to Chengdu from 290 yuan to 158 yuan, from Beijing to Nanning from 280 yuan to 174 yuan, from Beijing to Kunming from 480 yuan to 260 yuan, from Beijing to Urumqi from 654 yuan to 364 yuan, from Shanghai to Guangzhou from 155 yuan to 103 yuan, and from Chongqing to Kunming from 190 yuan to 94 yuan.

After the reduction in air fares, the gap between airplane and train ticket prices will be greatly reduced. For example, from Beijing to Guangzhou, a soft sleeper berth on the train costs 102 yuan, while a plane ticket will only cost 158 yuan. From Beijing to Shanghai, a soft sleeper berth costs 73 yuan, while a plane ticket will only cost 96 yuan. From Beijing to Chengdu, a train ticket costs 100 yuan, while a plane ticket only costs 158 yuan. Passengers who purchase round-trip plane tickets on domestic routes can enjoy a 10% discount; foreign self-funded travelers can also enjoy a 25% discount.

At the same time as the reduction in passenger fares, the prices for various types of cargo on domestic routes will also be generally reduced by an average of 40%. For example, the air freight rate from Beijing to Chongqing was originally 2.40 yuan per kilogram, but will be reduced to 1.47 yuan after July 1st. From Beijing to Shanghai, it will be reduced from 1.70 yuan to 0.77 yuan, from Beijing to Kunming from 3.90 yuan to 2.08 yuan, from Beijing to Urumqi from 5.20 yuan to 2.91 yuan, from Beijing to Guangzhou from 2.30 yuan to 1.26 yuan, and from Shanghai to Chongqing from 2.30 yuan to 1.28 yuan. In this way, some goods that could not be shipped by air in the past due to freight costs can now be transported by air in large quantities.

In recent years, civil aviation has developed rapidly, but in the past, due to higher costs, the fare levels were also higher, which to some extent limited the expansion of aviation services. During the rectification movement, civil aviation workers conducted special discussions on the fare issue. After their minds were liberated and superstitions were broken, they boldly proposed a series of technical innovation measures and accomplished some things that were previously considered impossible. In the past, the lifespan of "Li-2" airplanes was only 13,000 hours, but now it can be extended to 15,000 hours. The lifespan of the "A-82" engine has been extended from 1,300 hours to 2,500 hours. The overhaul interval for "Ilyushin Il-14" airplanes has been extended from 1,300 hours to 1,700 hours, and the repair cost of this type of aircraft has also been reduced from 160,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan. In addition, in order to improve the utilization rate of airplanes, they have also made many improvements in dispatching, meteorology, communication and navigation, and landing equipment. Therefore, it is now possible to achieve a general price reduction based on significantly reduced costs.

### 民航运价“七一”起普遍降低  全国航线平均降价40％

    民航运价“七一”起普遍降低
    全国航线平均降价40％
    据新华社27日讯　从7月1日起，国内各民用航空线上的飞机运价将普遍降低，平均降低40％。
    这次降低运价的原则是：飞往不沿铁路的地区或西北、西南交通不便的边远地区，旅客票价降低的幅度比较大，有些航线的票价差不多降低一半；飞往沿铁路的地区，降价幅度稍小。为了加强我国最大的三个大城市之间的联系，从北京到上海、北京到广州的飞机票价降得也比较多。
    运价降低以后，北京到上海的飞机客票价将从一百二十八元降为九十六元，北京到广州由二百三十五元降为一百五十八元，北京到成都由二百九十元降为一百五十八元，北京到南宁由二百八十元降为一百七十四元，北京到昆明由四百八十元降为二百六十元，北京到乌鲁木齐由六百五十四元降为三百六十四元，上海到广州由一百五十五元降为一百零三元，重庆到昆明由一百九十元降为九十四元。
    航空运价降低以后，飞机票价和火车票价之间的距离大大缩小了。比如由北京到广州，坐火车软席卧铺要一百零二元，坐飞机只要一百五十八元；从北京到上海，火车软席卧铺票价是七十三元，坐飞机只要九十六元；从北京到成都，火车票一百元，飞机只要一百五十八元。购买国内各航线上的来回飞机票可以享受九折优待；国外自费旅行者，还可以享受七五折的优待。
    和旅客票价降低的同时，国内各航线、各种货物运价平均也要普遍降低40％。比如，北京到重庆由飞机运送的货物原来每公斤运价为二元四角，7月1日以后降为一元四角七分，北京到上海由一元七角降为七角七分，北京到昆明由三元九角降为二元零八分，北京到乌鲁木齐由五元二角降为二元九角一分，北京到广州由二元三角降为一元二角六分，上海到重庆由二元三角降为一元二角八分。这样，原来有些由于运费负担问题不能交给飞机托运的货物，以后也可以大量由飞机运送了。
    近几年来，民用航空事业发展很快，但是过去由于成本较高，所以运价水平较高，在一定程度上限制了航空服务面的扩大。整风运动中，民航职工曾就运价问题进行专题鸣放。他们在思想得到解放、破除迷信以后，大胆提出了一系列的技术革新措施，办到了一些过去认为根本办不到的事。过去“立二型”飞机的寿命只有一万三千小时，现在可以延长到一万五千小时；“阿式八二型”发动机的寿命由一千三百小时延长为二千五百小时；“伊尔十四型”飞机大修的间隔时间从一千三百小时延长为一千七百小时，这种飞机的修理价格也从十六万元降低为九万元。另外，他们为了提高飞机的利用率，在改善调度、气象、通讯导航、降落设备等方面也作了许多改进。因而这次才有可能在大大降低成本的基础上，做到普遍降价。
