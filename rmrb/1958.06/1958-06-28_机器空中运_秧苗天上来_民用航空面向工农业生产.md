    Machines Transported by Air, Seedlings Come from the Sky
    Civil Aviation Orients Towards Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Our country's civil aviation has opened up broad avenues for industrial and agricultural production, and has achieved new accomplishments in the first half of this year. The transportation volume of aviation trunk lines has risen month by month, and the operating areas of specialized aviation are rapidly expanding.
    From January to June this year, the total turnover volume of aviation trunk lines is expected to increase by 12.9% compared with the same period last year. New varieties such as beet seeds, sweet potato seedlings, pesticides, bees, and fish fry have appeared in air cargo, supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. Nanyang County, Henan Province, delivered 3.78 million sweet potato seedlings in May this year alone. On many trunk lines and local routes, farmers and rural cadres also take civil aviation planes to handle affairs. In the first half of the year, civil aviation planes also transported many urgently needed materials for industrial production. Some parts for "Changjiang" brand automobiles were rushed to completion in Nanjing and then airlifted to Chongqing the next day, allowing the first car to be produced twenty-five days ahead of schedule.
    The flight hours of specialized aviation in the first half of this year increased by nearly 100% compared with the same period last year, the workload of aerial chemical operations increased by about 90%, and new types of work such as exterminating tree insects have been added. This year, in addition to conducting large-scale pest control work in eight provinces including Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei, it is also planned to use airplanes to sow grass seeds in Shaanxi. In aerial photography work, new technical equipment such as radio leveling and radar have been adopted this year, which has significantly improved the quality of photography.
    In the first half of this year, four local routes were opened: Xining—Lanzhou, Hefei—Fuyang, Kunming—Baoshan, and Chengdu—Xichang, and the total turnover volume is expected to exceed the planned target by 27%. Since the freight rates of local routes are close to ground freight rates, and air transport is much faster than ground transport, the business of local routes has developed rapidly. The total transportation turnover volume in 1957 was 978.9% of that in 1950; the basic construction investment in 1957 increased fifteenfold compared with 1950. The current aviation trunk lines and local routes can reach forty-five cities at home and abroad, and the route mileage has increased more than tenfold compared with 1950.
    Specialized aviation only had forest patrol in 1952, and now it has developed into an important technical force capable of performing a variety of low-altitude complex operations.

    机器空中运　秧苗天上来
    民用航空面向工农业生产
    本报讯　我国民用航空为工农业生产广开门路，今年上半年已获得了新的成就。航空干线的运输量逐月上升，专业航空的作业地区在迅速扩大。
    今年1月到6月，航空干线的运输总周转量预计比去年同时期增长12.9％。在航空货物中出现了甜菜籽、红薯秧、农药、蜜蜂、鱼苗等新品种，支援了农业生产大跃进。河南省南阳县今年5月就交运了三百七十八万株红薯秧。在许多干线和地方航线上，农民和农村干部也乘坐民航飞机出门办事。民航飞机在上半年还运送了工业生产上的许多急用物资。“长江”牌汽车的一部分配件，在南京赶制出来后的第二天就空运到重庆，使第一辆汽车能够提前二十五天出厂。
    专业航空的飞行小时今年上半年比去年同期增长了将近一倍，航空化学工作量增长了90％左右，并且增加了灭树虫等新的工种。今年除了在山东、江苏、河北等八省进行大面积的灭虫工作以外，还准备在陕西用飞机撒播草种。在航空摄影工作中，今年采用了无线电抄平和雷达等新的技术设备，显著地提高了摄影质量。
    今年上半年开辟了西宁—兰州、合肥—阜阳、昆明—保山、成都—西昌等四条地方航线，总周转量预计可以超额27％完成计划指标。由于地方航线的运价接近地面运价，而空运速度比地面运输快得多，因此地方航线的业务发展得很快。1957年的运输总周转量为1950年的978.9％；1957年的基本建设投资比1950年增加了十五倍。目前的航空干线和地方航线可以通达国内外的四十五个城市，航线里程比1950年增加了十几倍。
    专业航空在1952年只有巡护森林一种，现在已经发展成为一支能够进行多种低空复杂作业的重要的技术力量。
