Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 12th: According to newspaper and radio reports, insurgent forces in central and northern Lebanon engaged in fierce fighting with government troops again on June 11th.

The reports state that the insurgent forces of the Druze tribes in central Lebanon have launched a counter-offensive, crossing the Shouf and mountainous regions of central Lebanon, and are advancing victoriously. According to the Beirut "Al-Telegraph," the fighting in the Shouf area is extremely fierce, with a significant number of casualties on both sides.

Western news agencies reveal that the Chamoun group is extremely fearful that insurgent forces in this area will control the highway east of Beirut, as this would affect the food supply to Beirut from the fertile eastern basin. Reports indicate that the Chamoun group has mobilized troops to organize a counter-offensive in this area and has deployed aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the insurgents.

In the north, fighting continues in the areas of Halba and Tripoli. Government forces have recently been striving to control the city of Halba, located approximately fifteen miles northeast of Tripoli near the Syrian border, but their offensives have repeatedly failed due to the determined resistance of the People's Army. Newspaper reports indicate that government forces at the Abdah stronghold near Halba have been isolated because the People's Army destroyed the only bridge connecting Abdah to other areas.

According to Damascus Radio's evening news on June 11th, fighting in Tripoli is still ongoing.

This newspaper provides a comprehensive report: The United States is intensifying its interference in Lebanon's internal affairs through various means, aiding the Lebanese government in suppressing insurgent forces.

U.S. State Department spokesman White announced on June 11th that the United States is transporting a batch of tanks and aircraft to Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan. White did not specify the exact number of aircraft and tanks, but it was revealed that the aircraft alone numbered fifty.

Increasingly, reports indicate that the United States is instigating Iraq to form a military alliance with Lebanon so that the United States can more openly use the Baghdad Pact organization to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. According to the Middle East News Agency on June 11th, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA Director Allen Dulles held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali, who is currently in New York. They discussed the Lebanese crisis and the proposal for Lebanon to conclude a so-called defense treaty with the Iraq-Jordan Federation.

The Cairo "Al-Ahram" revealed on June 11th that U.S. Ambassador to Beirut McClintock had exerted pressure on Lebanese Army Commander Shehab regarding the suppression of the Lebanese people's uprising. During the meeting, the U.S. Ambassador told Shehab that he believed the Lebanese Army had not fulfilled its responsibilities in suppressing the uprising and that the Army's attitude toward the uprising was unclear.

Reports indicate that the Lebanese government is primarily using the gendarmerie to suppress the people's uprising. There are also reports that the Lebanese Army later participated in suppressing the people's uprising, but many Lebanese Army officers and soldiers are Muslims, and they are not enthusiastic about fighting the people.

    黎起义人民同政府军展开激战
    美国运送飞机坦克给黎政府镇压起义人民
    据新华社大马士革12日电　据报纸和电台消息，黎巴嫩中部和北部的起义人民11日同政府部队又进行了激烈战斗。
    消息说，黎巴嫩中部德鲁斯部落的起义人民转入反攻，越过了舒弗和黎巴嫩中部的山区，胜利地向前推进。据贝鲁特“电讯报”说，舒弗地区的战斗十分激烈。双方死伤人数都相当多。
    据西方通讯社透露，夏蒙集团非常害怕这个地区的起义人民控制贝鲁特以东的公路，因为这样就会影响东部肥沃盆地对贝鲁特的粮食供应。消息说，夏蒙集团已经抽调军队在这个地区组织反攻，并且出动了飞机，滥肆轰炸起义者。
    在北部，战斗仍在哈勒巴和的黎波里地区进行。政府部队最近以来竭力想控制在的黎波里东北约十五英里、靠近叙利亚边境的城市哈勒巴，但是在人民军的坚决抵抗下，政府部队的进攻一再遭到失败。据报纸消息，在哈勒巴附近阿卜达据点的政府部队已经被孤立，因为人民军炸毁了阿卜达通往其他地区的唯一的一座桥梁。
    据大马士革电台11日晚间的消息说，的黎波里的战斗仍在进行中。
    本报综合报道　美国正在加紧用各种手段干涉黎巴嫩内政，援助黎巴嫩政府镇压起义人民。
    美国国务院发言人怀特11日宣布，美国正在运输一批坦克和飞机给黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦三国。怀特没有说明这批飞机和坦克的具体数目，但是据透露单是飞机一项就有五十架。
    越来越多的消息表明，美国正在策动伊拉克同黎巴嫩结成军事联盟，以便使美国可以更公开地利用巴格达条约组织来干涉黎巴嫩的内政。据中东通讯社11日报道，美国国务卿福斯特·杜勒斯和中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯同现在正在纽约的伊拉克外交大臣贾马利举行了会谈。他们同他讨论了黎巴嫩的危机和黎巴嫩同伊拉克—约旦联邦缔结一项所谓防御条约的建议。
    开罗“金字塔报”11日揭露，美国驻贝鲁特大使麦克林托克曾经就镇压黎巴嫩人民起义的问题向黎巴嫩陆军司令谢哈布施加压力。这位美国大使在会谈中对谢哈布说，他认为黎巴嫩陆军在镇压起义方面没有尽责，陆军对起义的态度不明确。
    有消息说，黎巴嫩政府主要是用宪兵来镇压人民的起义。还有消息说，后来黎巴嫩陆军也参加了镇压人民的起义，但是，许多黎巴嫩陆军官兵是穆斯林，他们对于同人民打仗并不热心。（附图片）
