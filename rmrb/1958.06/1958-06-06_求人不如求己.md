　　Seeking Help From Others Is Not as Good as Seeking Help From Oneself
　　Wu Lü
    Equipment shortages are a common problem in the development of local industries. Some places solve this problem by sending people to major cities to purchase or negotiate orders at full speed. This method is certainly necessary, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Although large cities are willing to cooperate, they are overwhelmed by purchasers and orderers from all over the country, making it difficult to fulfill every request.
    The most fundamental way to solve the equipment problem of local industries is for each province and autonomous region to build a batch of backbone industries. This is a long-term plan and needs to be considered now. But "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst," so how should the current equipment problem be solved?
    Today's news in this newspaper about Henan Province making its own machines provides a good experience: seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself, and self-reliance can solve the equipment problem. See how many methods and how much energy they have after they start doing it themselves? Using iron instead of steel, wood instead of iron parts, and wooden bellows instead of blowers, they built small blast furnaces in a few dozen days.
    Speaking of which, this is not a new experience. Self-reliance has always been an important spirit for developing local industries. Local industry, as the name suggests, is industry established by the local people themselves. If they don't rely on their own efforts, who else can they rely on? However, some comrades always feel that it is difficult for local areas to solve the equipment problem through self-reliance.
    When they talk about industrial equipment, they think of hundreds of raw materials, thousands of parts, tens of thousands of processes, and "a fraction of a hair's breadth of tolerance," and so on. And when they talk about running industries, they feel that they must use this type of heavy and precise equipment, so they are at a loss. This is probably also a kind of mystification.
    To solve the equipment problem of local industries through self-reliance, we must first break this mystification and believe in the creativity of the masses. Some industrial equipment is indeed quite complex in structure and requires high technical skills, but this is always a minority; most equipment does not require such high technical skills, or the requirements can be high or low. Let's not talk about this. Even equipment with very complex structures and high technical requirements has been developed on the basis of older equipment with relatively simple structures and low technical requirements. Blowers and wooden bellows cannot be compared, but the principles are the same; heating furnaces and small furnaces in blacksmith shops are also incomparable, but the principles are also the same. If the principles are the same, it is not difficult to grasp the manufacturing technology of these "advanced equipment." Not only can we master it, but we can also transform it according to the specific conditions of our country. For example, using ordinary materials instead of expensive materials, using simple structures instead of complex structures, and using rudimentary techniques instead of advanced techniques to manufacture equipment with the same or even better performance. Isn't the "single-cylinder gas water pump" manufactured in Tianjin an example?
    So, is there any equipment that local areas cannot solve on their own? I think there is. For example, in some key local industrial projects planned by the province and the special zone, there may be some equipment that local forces cannot solve immediately. But if county-run local industries encounter equipment problems that they cannot solve, I think we can also examine the idea of running local industries. County-run local industries should focus on small-scale, which is the policy. If the factories are small, the equipment should naturally be small-scale and simple. Such equipment, except for a few areas with very weak industrial foundations, can generally be solved locally through self-reliance. If it cannot be solved, perhaps the equipment standards used are too high? If we can "use equipment in an unconventional manner," it may not be so difficult.
    Believing in the creativity of the masses, breaking mystification, adhering to the policy of focusing on small-scale, and determining equipment standards realistically, the equipment problem of local industries is not difficult to solve through self-reliance. Of course, from a long-term perspective, it is also necessary to establish a batch of backbone industries. This has been said before.

　　求人不如求己
　　吴滤
    设备不足，是地方工业发展中普遍存在的问题。有些地方解决这个问题的办法，是火速派人分赴各大城市采购或接洽订货。这办法当然也是必要的，但结果常常并不尽如人意。因为大城市虽有协作之意，无奈各地采购者、订货者蜂拥而至，总难有求必应。
    解决地方工业的设备问题，最根本的办法，是各个省和各个自治区都建设一批骨干工业。这是长久之计，也是现在就需要考虑的。但“远水不解近渴”，当前的设备问题怎样解决呢？
    今天本报发表的河南省自己动手造机器的新闻，提供了一个很好的经验：求人不如求己，自力更生来解决设备问题。你看，他们自己动手之后，办法多么多，干劲多么足？以铁代钢、以木料代铁件，以木风箱代替鼓风机，几十天的时间就把小高炉建设起来。
    说起来，这也不是什么新鲜的经验了。自力更生，本来就是发展地方工业的一个重要的精神。地方工业，顾名思义就是地方上自己兴办的工业，不靠地方上自力更生又去靠谁呢？然而，有些同志总觉得要地方上自力更生解决设备问题很困难。
    一谈到工业设备，他们就想到几百种原材料、几千个零件、几万道工序，还有“一根头发丝的几分之一的公差”，等等。而谈到办工业，他们又觉得好像非采用这类重型的和精密的设备不可，于是就一筹莫展了。这恐怕也是一种神秘观点。
    自力更生解决地方工业的设备问题，先要打破这种神秘观点，相信群众的创造精神。工业设备，有些确实是结构相当复杂、技术要求很高的，但这总是少数；多数的设备技术要求并不那么高，或者是可高也可低的。这且不说。即便是结构非常复杂、技术要求非常高的设备，也无一不是从结构比较简单、技术要求比较低的老式设备的基础上发展起来的。鼓风机同木风箱当然不能相提并论，但原理却是一样的；加热炉同铁匠铺里的小炉子也不可同日而语，但原理也是一样的。原理相通，就不难由此及彼，掌握这些“高级设备”的制造技术。不但能掌握它，而且能根据我们国家的具体情况来改造它。例如用一般的材料代替贵重的材料，用简单的结构代替复杂的结构，用粗浅的技术代替高深的技术，制造出同样性能的、甚至性能更好的设备来。天津制造的“单缸燃气水泵”不是一个例子吗？
    那么，有没有一种设备，是地方上依靠自己的力量不能解决的呢？我看也是有的。例如省里和专区筹建的一些地方工业的重点工程中，可能会有一些设备是当地的力量一下子还不能解决的。但如果是县营地方工业遇到自己不能解决的设备问题，我看还可以从办地方工业的思想来检查一下。县营地方工业以小型为主，这是方针。工厂是小型的，设备当然相应地也应该是小型的、因陋就简的。这样的设备，除了少数工业基础十分薄弱的地区之外，一般来说，大都是可以自力更生，就近解决的。如果不能解决的话，恐怕有些是采用的设备标准过于高了吧？若能“不拘一格用设备”，也许不会这么困难。
    相信群众的创造精神，打破神秘观点；坚持小型为主的方针，实事求是地确定设备标准，地方工业的设备问题是不难自力更生求得解决的。当然，从长远来考虑，还必须建立一批骨干工业。这在前面已经说过了。
