Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 10th – Washington dispatch: Some U.S. government figures, in recent conversations, revealed unconcealed joy regarding the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia, the revisionist theories of the Yugoslav leadership group, and the Yugoslav Communist Party's vicious attacks on the socialist camp.

Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, Elbrick, during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 3rd, praised the Yugoslav leadership group's attacks on the socialist camp and its pandering to the United States. He said that Tito "is doing quite well."

According to a recent disclosure in the "New York Post," Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, Frederick Jandrey, in a memorandum to Secretary of State Dulles and congressional leaders, requested continued "aid" to Yugoslavia in order to support the Tito group. Jandrey said that the current stance adopted by the Yugoslav leadership group has "immense value to the West," and Yugoslavia has played an "influence exceeding its normal role" in Eastern Europe in the past. "Giving aid to Yugoslavia is very clearly in our (the United States) interests."

    南斯拉夫领导集团攻击社会主义阵营
    美政府人士喜出望外主张继续给赏钱
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国一些政府人士在最近的谈话中对美国和南斯拉夫的关系，对南斯拉夫领导集团的修正主义理论，对南共对社会主义阵营的恶毒攻击流露出情不自禁的喜悦。
    负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿埃尔布里克3日在参议院外交委员会作证时对南斯拉夫领导集团攻击社会主义阵营和逢迎美国的做法表示嘉许。他说：铁托“做得很不错”。
    据“纽约邮报”不久前透露，负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿帮办弗雷德里克·詹德里在一份给国务卿杜勒斯和国会领袖们的备忘录中要求继续对南斯拉夫进行“援助”，以便给铁托集团撑腰。詹德里说，南斯拉夫领导集团目前采取的立场对“西方有着极大的价值”，南斯拉夫过去在东欧已经发挥了“超过正常作用的影响”，“给予南斯拉夫援助非常明显地是符合我们（美国）的利益的”。
