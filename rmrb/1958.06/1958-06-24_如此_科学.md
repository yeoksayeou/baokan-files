    So "Scientific"
    Dr. Fashagil, a scientific advisor to the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said at the "Medical Civil Defense Conference" in the United States on June 21 that the United States could "effectively use germ warfare." His method is to "cultivate bacteria in women's face powder, non-alcoholic beverages, milk, medicines, and biological products." Once these things are used or eaten, the germs enter the body and cause death.
    Let's not discuss the effectiveness of this whimsical method for now. However, it can be clearly seen that the war clamored by the United States is aimed at peaceful people. Because only women, children, and the sick frequently use those things.
    A so-called doctor of science, at a medical conference, does not talk about rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, but talks with relish about his methods of killing. Truly: such American "science"! Such American "doctor"!

    如此“科学”
    美国陆军化学兵处的科学顾问法沙吉尔博士，6月21日在美国“医学民防年会”上说，美国可以“有效地利用细菌战”。他的办法是，“在妇女搽脸用的香粉中、不含酒精的饮料、牛奶、药品以及生物制品中培植细菌”，用了或吃了这些东西，病菌就进入身体，置人死命。
    这种异想天开的办法的效用究竟如何，姑且勿论。但是，可以清楚地看到，美国所叫嚣的战争是以和平人民为对象的。因为只有妇女、儿童和病人才会经常使用那些东西。
    号称科学博士，在有关医学的会议上，不谈救死扶伤，却津津有味地大大谈其杀人办法。真是：如此美国“科学”！如此美国“博士”！
