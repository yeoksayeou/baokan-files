    Irrigating Farmland with Petroleum Depot Fire Wells
    The Petroleum Trading Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce has many petroleum depots throughout the country, and each depot has its own water wells to ensure water for firefighting. However, fire wells are a backup facility and are usually idle for years without being used. During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, these reserve water resources should be fully utilized to irrigate farmland and support agricultural production. This way, fire wells can be used to irrigate farmland, and the wells can be kept flowing to prevent them from being blocked. Therefore, I suggest that all petroleum depots across the country should actively support nearby agricultural production if they have fire wells.

    用石油库消防井灌溉农田
    商业部石油贸易局在全国各地有很多石油库，每个石油库都自备水井保证消防用水。但是消防水井是一种备用设施，通常长年累月闲置着使用不上。在农业生产大跃进期间应当充分利用这些后备水量灌溉农田，以支援农业生产。这样既可以用消防水井灌溉农田，又可以使水井常出水，防止水井堵塞。因此，我建议全国各石油库如果有消防水井的话，应该主动支援附近的农业生产。
