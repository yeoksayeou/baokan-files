    Striving to Complete Socialist Construction
    —Notes on the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia
    By our correspondent Yang Yi
    The four-day 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC) successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 21st. This congress was rich in content and yielded great results. Participating in this congress were not only more than 1,400 delegates representing the CPC's more than 1.4 million members, but also delegations from more than fifty Communist and Workers' Parties from around the world. As CPC Political Bureau member Fierlinger said, "This congress demonstrated the ideological and action unity and solidarity of fraternal parties from various countries."
    The congress was permeated with a precious spirit of proletarian internationalism from beginning to end. The vanguard fighters of the working class of the whole world are consolidated and closely united, learning from each other and supporting each other. Every congratulatory message from the representatives of fraternal parties was greeted with warm cheers and applause. Every congratulatory message contained trust and respect for socialist Czechoslovakia.
    The congress adhered to and promoted the principled stance of Marxism-Leninism, expressed its heartfelt support for the two declarations of the Moscow meeting last year, unanimously safeguarded the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and firmly expressed its opposition to modern revisionist thought—the main danger in the current international workers' movement. The report by Novotný, the opening speech by Široký, the speeches by Hendrych and many other delegates, as well as the speeches by representatives of fraternal parties from various countries, all condemned in unison the South Communist revisionist leadership group's shameful betrayal of the proletarian cause, and condemned the South Communist leadership group's despicable actions as agents of imperialism. From these reports and speeches, one can also see the principled stance and firm determination of Communist Parties of various countries to fight modern revisionism to the end.
    The congress was convened under the inspiring slogan of Czechoslovakia "completing socialist construction." The reports and discussions during the four days fully demonstrated the firm confidence, full vigor, and courageous spirit of the Czechoslovak working people in realizing this great historical task. No one expressed any hesitation or doubt about this arduous mission. Everyone proudly talked about past achievements, seriously analyzed the problems facing them now and in the future, and bravely shouldered the sacred tasks assigned to them by the Party. Comrade Kopecký called on everyone in his speech to dare to think and dare to act. Indeed, most of the Party representatives from local factories and rural areas who stood on the podium used solemn promises to show that they were such a group of builders of the new world who dared to think and dared to act. The unprecedented achievements of the socialist labor competition held before the congress to welcome the congress also proved that they knew how to fulfill their guarantees.
    The great goal of communism makes the delegates in no way satisfied with the existing achievements. They strictly examined the problems and shortcomings in their work, and publicly criticized various malpractices and relevant departments and personnel at the congress. Criticism and self-criticism accounted for a large proportion of the delegates' speeches. The delegates attending the congress always responded to these sharp criticisms with warm applause. Because they knew that this was precisely the driving force for accelerating the completion of socialism.
    The delegates' speeches expressed a high degree of trust in the correct and strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, and demonstrated the complete consistency of thought and understanding of the entire Party. All speeches called for strengthening the Party's leadership in all aspects of national life, believing that this was the guarantee and prerequisite for doing all work well. Strengthening political and ideological work, strengthening communist education and cultural revolution work, were also given great importance at this congress. It can be expected that after the closing of the congress, a new upsurge of vigorous development will emerge in all aspects of work in Czechoslovakia.

    为完成社会主义建设而奋斗
    ——记捷共第十一次代表大会
    本报记者  杨翊
    进行了四天的捷共第十一次代表大会于21日下午胜利闭幕了。这次大会内容丰富，收获很大。参加这次大会的不仅有捷共一百四十多万党员的一千四百多名代表，还有来自世界各地的五十多个共产党和工人党的代表团。正如捷共政治局委员费林格所说：“这次大会显示了各国兄弟党思想和行动上的统一与团结”。
    大会自始至终洋溢着可贵的无产阶级国际主义气氛。全世界工人阶级的先锋战士巩固地亲密地团结在一起，互相学习，彼此支持。每个兄弟党代表的祝词，都受到热烈的欢呼和鼓掌。每篇祝词中都包含了对社会主义捷克斯洛伐克的信赖和尊敬。
    大会坚持和发扬了马克思列宁主义的原则立场，表明了对去年莫斯科会议两项宣言的衷心拥护，一致维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，也坚定地表示反对现代修正主义思潮——当前国际工人运动的主要危险。诺沃提尼的报告，西罗基的开幕词，亨德里赫和其他许多代表的发言，以及各国兄弟党代表的讲话，都同声斥责南共修正主义领导集团对无产阶级事业的可耻背叛，斥责南共领导集团充当帝国主义代理人的卑鄙行径。从这些报告和发言中，也可看到各国共产党决心同现代修正主义斗争到底的原则立场和坚定决心。
    代表大会是在捷克斯洛伐克“完成社会主义建设”的豪迈口号下召开的。四天中的报告和讨论，充分表现了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对实现这一伟大历史任务的坚定信心、充沛干劲和勇往直前的精神。没有人对这项艰巨使命表示任何犹豫和怀疑。大家都自豪地谈到过去的成绩，认真分析了现在和将来面临的问题，勇敢地担负起党交给他们的神圣任务。柯别茨基同志在发言中号召大家敢想敢做。的确，站在讲台上的大部分来自地方工厂和农村的党的代表，都用庄严的诺言，表明了他们就是这样一群敢想敢做的新世界的建设者。会前为迎接大会而举行的社会主义劳动竞赛的空前成就，也证明了他们是懂得怎样完成自己的保证的。
    共产主义的伟大目标使得代表们丝毫也不满足于现有的成就。他们严格地检查工作中的毛病和缺点，在大会上公开批评各种不良现象和有关的部门和人员。批评和自我批评在代表们的发言中占了很大比重。出席大会的代表对这些尖锐的批评总是报以热烈的掌声。因为，他们知道，这正是加速建成社会主义的动力。
    代表们的发言表现了对党中央正确而坚强的领导的高度信赖，表现了全党思想和认识上的完全一致。所有的发言都要求在国家生活的各个方面加强党的领导，认为这是做好一切工作的保证和前提。加强政治思想工作，加强共产主义教育和文化革命工作，也在这次代表大会上受到极大重视。可以预期，在大会闭幕后，捷克斯洛伐克各方面的工作将涌现出一个新的蓬勃发展的高潮。
