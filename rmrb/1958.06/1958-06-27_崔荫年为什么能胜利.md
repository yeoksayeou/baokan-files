Why Cui Yinnian Was Able to Succeed
    Chen Zhiyan
    After thousands of experiments, Cui Yinnian, an engineer at the Tianjin Daxin Enamel Insulated Wire Factory, successfully developed high-strength enamel insulated wire, a technologically complex product.
    If you ask how Cui Yinnian achieved this victory, a thousand experiments still cannot fully answer the question. The important thing is that Cui Yinnian overcame three mental hurdles.
    The first hurdle: If foreigners can do it, can we? Polymer chemistry is a profound and complex field of study in the world, and the factory's equipment is also very poor. Can it be done? Cui Yinnian's courage, coupled with the support of the Party, the administration, and the trade union, helped him to clear this hurdle. The answer is: If foreigners can do it, we can definitely do it too.
    The second hurdle: Should he blindly follow existing formulas, or should he solve problems creatively? Cui Yinnian also overcame this. Formulas are certainly useful, but there isn't only one formula forever. He moved away from the books and adopted a solvent that cost less than one yuan per kilogram.
    The third hurdle: Should he fight alone, or should he unite with ordinary technicians and workers? Cui Yinnian did not confine himself to the laboratory. As a result, a word from an old worker helped him solve a major problem and paved the way for the final completion of the high-strength enamel insulated wire trial production.
    Today's China is in an era of technological leap—an era of technological revolution. This leap is prominently manifested in the fact that millions of people have crossed the threshold of technology, and mass inventions and creations have greatly developed productivity. A British journalist—Frederick Ellis of the "Daily Express"—was shocked by this great change and said: "Almost overnight, all Chinese farmers have become highly skilled engineers and technicians." This may be his deliberate exaggeration, but it is true that the masses have infinite wisdom. This leap is also manifested in the fact that our scientists and technicians are advancing on the road to mastering all the world's cutting-edge technologies without fear of hardship. There is no need to doubt that we will certainly be able to understand everything that people in the world know. However, how can we muster enough energy to strive for the best? How can we understand it faster? How can we better meet the needs of the current reality? This requires us to overcome several ideological hurdles. Cui Yinnian overcame several hurdles, and as a result, he succeeded. Perhaps high-strength enamel insulated wire is not the latest cutting-edge technology in the world, but when we are determined to overcome these hurdles, what is there in the world of the latest technology that we cannot master? Please see, there is also a news item in today's newspaper reporting that three young technicians in Shanghai have developed the world's latest type of fertilizer—glass fertilizer, isn't that proof?

    崔荫年为什么能胜利
    陈之衍
    经过了上千次的试验，天津大新漆包线厂的工程师崔荫年制成了技术复杂的高强度漆包线。
    若问崔荫年如何取得这场胜利，一千次的试验还不能全部答复这个问题。重要的是崔荫年在思想上闯过了三关。
    第一关：外国人能干的，我们能不能干？高分子化学在世界上说来，也是一门高深复杂的学问，而这个厂的设备又很差。能行吗？崔荫年的勇气加上党、行政和工会的支持，这一关闯过去了。回答是：外国人能干的，我们一定也能干。
    第二关：是迷信现成的公式，还是独创地解决问题？崔荫年也闯过去了。公式当然有用处，然而不是永远只有一个公式。他离开了书本，采用了每斤成本不到一元的溶剂。
    第三关：是孤军奋战，还是和普通的技术员、工人结合？崔荫年不是老把自己关在实验室里，结果，老工人的一句话，帮他解决了大问题，为他最后完成高强度漆包线的试制铺平了道路。
    当前的中国，处在一个技术上飞跃的时代——技术革命的时代。这个飞跃，突出地表现在千百万群众，跨进了技术的门槛，群众性的发明创造，大大地发展了生产力。一个英国记者——“每日快报”的弗雷德里克·埃里斯由于这种大变化震惊地说：“几乎在一夜之间，全中国的农民变成了具有高度技术的工程师和技术人员。”这也许是他故作惊人之笔，然而群众具有无穷的智慧，这是确实的。这个飞跃，还表现在我国的科学家、技术人员，不畏艰苦，在掌握世界上的一切尖端技术的大道上前进。不需要怀疑，凡是世界上有人懂得的学问，我们都一定能懂。可是，怎样鼓足干劲，力争上游？怎样懂得更快些？怎样更切合当前实际的需要？这就需要在思想上过几关，崔荫年闯过了几关，结果胜利了。也许高
    强度漆包线还不是什么世界上最新的尖端技术，然而当我们立志要闯过这几关，又有什么世界上的最新技术我们不能掌握呢？请看，今天本报还有一条消息，报道上海三个青年技术员制成世界上最新型的肥料——玻璃肥料，不就是一个证明吗？
