    "Old Communist Youth League Member"

    "Old Communist Youth League Member" by Comrade Chang Fa is a story depicting the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the Anti-Japanese United Army and the Party's underground organizations in the cities against the enemy in the Northeast under the strict rule of the Japanese invaders after the "September 18th Incident." The author was a member of the Communist Youth League at the time and had been engaged in arduous struggle behind enemy lines for a long time. Therefore, in this book, he truthfully reflects the heroic struggle of the Communist Youth League members under the leadership of the Party at that time; simply portrays the image of the protagonist, Communist Youth League member He You; and narrates how an ordinary proletarian revolutionary fighter grows up under the cultivation of the Party and the tempering of struggle.

    “老共青团员”
    常发同志著的“老共青团员”，是一部描写“九一八”以后，中国共产党领导抗日联军和党在城市的地下组织，在日寇严密统治下的东北，同敌人作英勇斗争的故事。作者是当年的共青团员，曾经长时期在敌后进行艰苦的斗争，因而他在本书里，真实地反映了当时的共青团员在党的领导下所进行的英勇斗争；朴素地塑造了主人公共青团员何有这个形象；叙述了一个普通的无产阶级革命战士，在党的培养和斗争的锻炼中，如何成长起来。（工）
