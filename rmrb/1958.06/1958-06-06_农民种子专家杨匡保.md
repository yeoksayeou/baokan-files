　　Farmer Seed Expert Yang Kuangbao
　　By our reporter Yi Xintian
    In a few short years of practice, an ordinary farmer mastered the entire technology of rice seeds and became a seed expert. His advanced deeds are spreading throughout the country, and the improved rice varieties he cultivated are being promoted more and more widely in various places. People respectfully call him the Seed Champion and the Farmer Scientist. This farmer is Yang Kuangbao, director and Party branch secretary of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Luqiao Town, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province. People, from the fact that Yang Kuangbao became an expert, once again believe in this truth: science is not mysterious, and farmers who have not received higher education can also master science and technology and reach the level of experts.
    Yang Kuangbao is twenty-eight years old this year and has only studied for two years. He and the agricultural cooperative he leads have carefully selected and bred thirty-three improved rice varieties in recent years. Most of them have now been promoted. This year, the cooperative's planting area of improved varieties has increased from 15% three years ago to 98%. Not only has it achieved self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use, but in the past two or three years, it has also bred more than 550,000 jin of improved varieties to support local areas and other provinces, achieving the requirements of large breeding volume, rapid popularization, good quality, and low cost. Now the cooperative has established a sound seed selection organization and system. More than 400 male and female members of the cooperative have participated in seed research groups, seed professional teams, and seed selection shock teams. They can all recognize the characteristics of various varieties and identify rice ears that meet the standards. Yang Kuangbao and several cooperative cadres have mastered a complete set of seed selection techniques. They plant different varieties according to soil quality and fertility, adopt corresponding advanced farming techniques according to variety characteristics, and carry out reasonable variety matching—constantly replacing new varieties as fertility improves. Last year, the cooperative's more than 1,300 mu of rice averaged 1,081 jin per mu, nearly double the increase compared to before liberation. The selection of improved varieties is one of the main keys to increasing production. This year, after the cooperative planned to produce 1,550 jin per mu, 98% of the rice fields were sown with improved varieties that have the advantages of thick stalks, large ears, full grains, strong drought resistance, and no rice blast disease, and it is estimated that each mu can increase production by more than 140 jin.
    In the process of boldly breeding and promoting improved varieties, Yang Kuangbao has continuously been opposed by various conservative and backward ideas, suffered many sarcasms and blows, and encountered many difficulties. However, Yang Kuangbao is a farmer with this kind of character: when he believes that he is doing the right thing, he is not afraid of any obstacles or difficulties and will do it to the end. Therefore, all obstacles, blows, and difficulties were overcome by him one by one.
    When Yang Kuangbao was in his teens, he was very interested in rice varieties. However, at that time, his family had no fields or land, and there was no way to talk about breeding improved varieties for experimentation. After the land reform, Yang Kuangbao had his own land, and he began his seed research work. His home was full of bunches of rice ears hanging on the walls, piles of grains on the table, and plots of seedling fields enclosed in the fields, planting various varieties for comparative experiments. These activities never stopped. After the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, he proposed to establish seed fields and introduce and breed improved varieties such as 503 Nantao, but was opposed by many people. Some said: "Planting 503 will cause the water to flood to the bed; planting Nantao will eat away the food of future generations." Others satirized him for wanting to be a model and striving for glory. However, Yang Kuangbao did not waver because of this. He firmly believed in the experience of the older generation of farmers: "Good mother, good daughter, good seeds, good rice"; he remembered what the county cadres said that selecting improved varieties is an important measure to increase production. He thought: If you don't believe it, I will show you examples of increased production. He established the first seed experimental field in the cooperative and introduced improved varieties such as 503 Nantao and Dajingbai. At this time, old farmers Li Zanqing and Lin Sanmei did not agree. They said: "We have been farming all our lives, and we harvest grain every year without selecting seeds." They planted local varieties and competed with Yang Kuangbao. Unfortunately, shortly after Yang Kuangbao sowed the seeds, seedling rot and abnormal rice awns occurred. Some people were sneering at him. At this time, the higher authorities encouraged him, and most of the cooperative members supported him. Yang Kuangbao transplanted the seedlings and carefully cultivated them, and as a result, he harvested 182 jin more per mu than Li Zanqing and the others. The cooperative members then believed in the principle of increased production from improved varieties. Li Zanqing was also convinced and exchanged 150 jin of improved varieties from Yang Kuangbao. From then on, Yang Kuangbao realized that as long as the right thing is persisted in, it will surely overcome difficulties and achieve victory.
    After Yang Kuangbao persisted in seed selection and achieved great success, he and his agricultural cooperative have been successively rated as patriotic and high-yielding models in the county, province, and country for several years. Yang Kuangbao is not satisfied with his existing achievements. He is still constantly picking the best from the good and striving for perfection in selecting and breeding better improved varieties.

　　农民种子专家杨匡保
　　本报记者  伊心恬
    一个普通农民在短短几年的实践中，掌握了水稻种子的整套技术，成为种子专家。他的先进事迹在全国传播着，他培育出来的水稻良种正越来越广地在各地推广着。人们尊称他为种子状元、农民科学家。这位农民就是浙江省黄岩县路桥镇第一农业社主任、党支部书记杨匡保。人们从杨匡保成为专家这一事实，又一次相信了这样一个真理：科学并不神秘，没有受过高等教育的农民也能掌握科学技术，达到专家的水平。
    杨匡保今年二十八岁，只读过两年书。他和他领导的农业社，几年来精选繁育了三十三种水稻良种，现在大部分已推广，今年这个社良种种植面积已由三年前的15％增加到98％，不仅做到了自育自选自留自用，而且两三年来还繁育了五十五万多斤良种支援本地和省内外，达到了繁育多、普及快、质量好、成本省的要求。现在这个社已建立了一套健全的选种组织和制度。社里有四百多男女社员参加了种子研究小组、种子专业队和选种突击队，他们都能认识各种品种特性，辨别合乎标准的稻穗。杨匡保和几个社干部已掌握了一套完整的选种技术。他们根据土质、肥力看田种植不同品种，根据品种特性采用相适应的先进耕作技术并进行品种合理搭配——随着肥力提高不断更换新品种。去年这个社一千三百多亩水稻平均亩产一千零八十一斤，比解放前增加近两倍，选用良种是增产的主要关键之一。今年社里规划亩产一千五百五十斤后，98％的稻田都播种了具有株粗穗大、粒粒饱满、抗旱力强、无稻热病等优点的良种，估计每亩能增产一百四十斤以上。
    杨匡保在大胆繁育推广良种中不断受到了各种保守落后思想的反对，遭到许多讽刺打击，也碰到不少困难。但是杨匡保是具有这样性格的农民：当他相信是做对的事情，就不怕任何阻挠困难，一定要干到底。因此，一切阻挠、打击、困难都被他一一冲破了。
    杨匡保还在十多岁的时候，他就对水稻品种很感兴趣。可是那时他家没田没地，根本谈不到繁育良种试验。土改后，杨匡保有了自己的土地，也就开始了种子研究工作。他家里壁上挂满了一束束的稻穗，桌上放着一堆堆谷粒，田里围起一块块的秧田，播种各种品种对比试验，这些活动从不间断。农业社建立后，他就提出了建立种子田，引种繁育503南特号等良种，但受到很多人反对。有的说：种了503，大水满到眠床间；种上南特号，吃掉子孙饭。还有人讽刺他是想当模范，争光荣。可是杨匡保并没有因此动摇，他坚信老辈农民说的：娘好囡好种好稻好的经验；他记住县里干部说的选用良种是重要增产措施。他想：你们不信，我要拿出增产的实例给你们看。他在社里建立了第一块种子试验田，引种了503南特号、大荆白等良种。这时老农民李赞清、林三妹不赞成，他们说：种田种了一辈子，不选种也年年收谷。他们种了土种和杨匡保比高低。不巧得很，杨匡保播种不久发生了烂秧和变态稻芒。有些人在冷讽热嘲他。这时，上级鼓励他，大多数社员支持他。杨匡保插下秧，细心培育，结果每亩比李赞清他们多收了一百八十二斤。社员们从此相信了良种增产的道理。李赞清也口服心服了，他们向杨匡保调换了一百五十斤良种。从此杨匡保体会到：对的事情只要坚持下去，就一定会战胜困难，得到胜利。
    杨匡保坚持选种得到很大成就后，他和他的农业社几年来连续被评为县、省和全国的爱国丰产模范。杨匡保并不满足于已有成就，他仍然不断地好中挑好、精益求精地挑选、培育更好的良种。
