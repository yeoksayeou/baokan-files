Broad "Seeking of Scriptures"
　　
Tang Tao

The "People's Daily" published Comrade Zeng Zhi's "Talking about 'Seeking Scriptures'" on May 21st, page four. Based on the gains of the on-site meeting held by the Ministry of Metallurgy in Benxi, it advocated that leading cadres should step out of their offices, go deep into the grassroots, and "seek scriptures" from the masses, absorbing the wisdom and experience of the masses to enrich leadership thinking and solve practical problems. The Party has always adhered to the mass line, and following the mass line is the best leadership method. Therefore, "Talking about 'Seeking Scriptures'" is also a very good article.

Here, I am reminded of another matter, and I would like to expand on the topic.

In this intellectual self-examination movement, many people, like Tang Sanzang, have experienced the eighty-one tribulations in their inner world. Finally, they confided in the Party, felt relieved, and were full of energy. However, some people are not like this. They have not grasped the direction, their minds have not been liberated, and they are still "desolate, miserable, and forlorn." If we use "seeking scriptures" as a metaphor, the former group has already seen "Leiyin Temple," while the latter group cannot see it and cannot reach it. Hearing that others are feeling comfortable, they are still skeptical, muttering in their hearts: Is there really such a "scripture"? Is there really such a good state of mind?

Where exactly are the "scriptures"?

In fact, Wu Cheng'en had already answered this question in "Journey to the West." When Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Monk were helping Tang Sanzang to seek scriptures, they passed through the Flaming Mountains. The flames soared to the sky, and a great fire blocked their way. The master and disciples were hot and thirsty. Wukong burned his hair, and Bajie almost became roasted pork for others to eat. Tang Sanzang had no way to think, so he discussed solutions with his disciples to see if there were other routes to take in order to obtain the scriptures. It is said that there are many roads, but there is one point: where there are scriptures, there is fire; where there is no fire, there are no scriptures. If you are afraid of fire, then don't bother seeking scriptures!

I think this is the key to the problem.

The "scriptures" are in the raging fire, in the places that people think are the most difficult – difficult to say, difficult to think, difficult to do, and difficult to explain. If intellectuals in the self-examination movement are afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, afraid of water when crossing the Quicksand River, afraid of fire when encountering the Flaming Mountains, greedy for the ginseng fruit, and unable to maintain their chastity when entering the Spider Cave, then this is called impure desires. Those who have not cleansed their bourgeois individualism have numerous demons in their minds, including the Bull Demon King, the Black Wind Monster, and the Spider Demons. If they do not overcome these first, even if the "scriptures" are right in front of them, they will still not be able to see them, and naturally, there will be no question of a comfortable and lively situation.

Where there are scriptures, there is fire; where there is no fire, there are no scriptures. This is a sentence that is always worth pondering. This is the case for the intellectual self-examination movement, and it is also the case for leading cadres going deep into the grassroots. Moreover, I also believe that the glorious scene of "Leiyin Temple" is endless. For those who are feeling comfortable, under the situation of great ideological liberation, to muster up their energy and strive for progress, they must continue to "seek scriptures" and continue to "seek scriptures" in the places where the flames are most intense.

The "scriptures" can never be fully obtained. Where are the "scriptures"? In the raging fire.

    广“取经”
    唐弢
    5月21日“人民日报”四版发表了曾志同志的“谈‘取经’”，根据冶金部在本溪召开现场会议的收获，主张领导干部走出办公室，深入基层，到群众中去“取经”，吸收群众的智慧和经验，来丰富领导思想，解决实际问题。党始终坚持群众路线，走群众路线是最好的领导方法，因此，“谈‘取经’”也是一篇很好的文章。
    我这里却想起另一件事，也来借题发挥一下。
    在这一次知识分子交心运动中，许多人像唐僧一样，在内心世界里经历了九九八十一难，最后向党交了心，觉得心情舒畅，干劲十足；但也有一些人不这样，方向没有抓准，思想没有解放，依旧是“冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”。如果以“取经”为喻，前一种人已经望见了“雷音”，后一种人则看不见，到不了，听说别人心情舒畅，他还是将信将疑，在心底里嘀咕着：真有这样的“经”？真有这样的好境界吗？
    “经”，究竟在那里呢？
    这一问题，其实吴承恩在“西游记”里早已做出答案了。当孙行者、猪八戒、沙和尚帮着唐僧去取经时，路过火焰山，烈焰冲天，大火挡住了去路。师徒们走得又热又渴，行者给烧去毫毛，八戒差点儿让人吃了烤猪肉。唐僧无法可想，就和徒弟们商量办法，为了取经，看有没有别条路可走。据说：路多得很，只是有一点：有经处有火，无火处无经。如果怕火，那就干脆不必去取经！
    我看这就是问题的关键。
    “经”在烈火里，在人们认为最困难——难说，难想，难干，难交代的地方。知识分子在交心运动中，如果前怕狼，后怕虎，过流沙河怕水，遇火焰山怕火，见人参果而大动食指，入盘丝洞又难持色戒，这就叫六根未净。凡是资产阶级个人主义六根未净的人，他的思想里魔障重重，有牛魔王，有黑风怪，也有蜘蛛精，不先把这些克服，即使“经”在眼前，也还是一个看不见，自然更谈不到心情舒畅、生动活泼的局面了。
    有经处有火，无火处无经。这是一句永远值得我们思索的话。对知识分子交心运动是这样，对领导干部深入基层也是这样。而且，我还以为，“雷音”的胜境是无穷尽的，对心情舒畅的人来说，在思想大解放的形势下，要鼓足干劲，力争上游，也还得继续“取经”，向火焰最猛烈的地方去继续“取经”。
    “经”是取不完的。“经”在哪里？在烈火里。
