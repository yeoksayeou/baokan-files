Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 14th (Reporter Zhang Lizhong) -- Henan Province has another county with a wheat yield exceeding the Yellow River in a single season—Meng County. This year, the county's 258,000-plus mu of wheat achieved an average yield of 538 jin and 14 liang per mu. Among them, 500 mu yielded between 1,500 and 2,000 jin per mu, and 7,590 mu yielded between 1,000 and 1,500 jin per mu. The wheat yield of two townships and thirty agricultural cooperatives in the county exceeded the Yangtze River in a single season.

Meng County's wheat harvest is the result of the Meng County people, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, going all out, aiming high, and continuously criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking. In 1956, Meng County, like the rest of the country, experienced a production leap forward, with an average wheat yield of 230 jin per mu, and the average annual grain yield exceeded the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). However, in 1957, a counter-current of opposing "rash advances" emerged. The county was timid and lacked drive, focusing on difficulties, resulting in a sharp drop in wheat yield to 172 jin per mu. When formulating the 1958 wheat production increase plan, their thinking was initially not liberated, feeling that raising the yield from 172 jin to 270 jin was already significant. Later, under the situation of an overall great leap forward, and through continuous criticism of right-leaning conservative thinking, the wheat production increase plan was raised from 270 jin per mu to 300 jin, from 300 jin to 350 jin, and from 350 jin to 400 jin. Unexpectedly, the actual yield reached 538 jin and 14 liang. The yield situation over the past three years has formed a clear saddle shape. The saddle shape has educated the Party leadership of Meng County and the people of the entire county.

Because of the criticism of right-leaning conservative thinking, and the formulation of advanced targets and measures, the cadres and masses of Meng County have shown great enthusiasm. At the time of wheat sowing, they encountered a hundred days of drought without rain. However, the people of the county went all out, mobilizing 90,000 people, digging wells twenty zhang deep, and digging canals more than ten li long, fighting hard for twenty days and nights, and planting 220,000 mu of wheat while combating the drought. Immediately afterwards, they creatively launched activities to transplant wheat seedlings, ensuring full seedlings in 160,000 mu of land with missing seedlings. In between, they also overcame the wheat sucking bug, which severely harmed wheat seedlings. When the wheat reached the jointing and booting stage, they fought hard for four days and nights, mobilizing 30,000 people, lighting 80,000 smoke fires in the wheat fields, and overcoming four severe frosts. When the wheat was about to ripen, a major wind and rainstorm occurred. The best wheat in the county was all covered with nets and bundled into wheat sheaves to prevent lodging. In this way, although natural disasters this year were greater than in previous years, under the circumstances of people's soaring enthusiasm, the wheat finally had a bumper harvest.

(Editor's note: In 1957, the county with the highest wheat yield per mu in the country was Zhangye County, Gansu Province, with a total sown area of ​​360,000 mu and an average yield of 464.7 jin per mu.)

### 亩产538斤一季跨过黄河  孟县创小麦高产新纪录

    亩产538斤一季跨过黄河
    孟县创小麦高产新纪录
    新华社郑州14日电　记者张励中报道：河南省又出现了一个小麦一季过黄河的高产县——孟县。这个县今年的二十五万八千多亩小麦，平均每亩产量达到五百三十八斤十四两。其中亩产一千五百斤到两千斤以上的有五百亩，亩产一千斤到一千五百斤的有七千五百九十亩，全县有两个乡、三十个农业社的小麦一季跨过了长江。
    孟县的小麦丰收，是孟县人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，不断批判右倾保守思想得来的。1956年，孟县同全国一样，曾经来了一个生产跃进，每亩小麦平均产二百三十斤，全年粮食平均产量超过了全国农业生产发展纲要（修正草案）的指标。但是到1957年，却来了一股反“冒进”的逆流，这个县畏首畏尾，干劲不足，看困难多，结果小麦一下子降到亩产一百七十二斤。在制订1958年小麦增产计划的时候，开始思想也还没有解放，觉得从一百七十二斤提高到二百七十斤已经不算少了；后来在全面大跃进的形势下，不断批判右倾保守思想，小麦增产计划由亩产二百七十斤提高到三百斤，由三百斤提高到三百五十斤，由三百五十斤又提到四百斤。不想实际产量却达到了五百三十八斤十四两。三年来的产量情况，形成了一个明显的马鞍形。马鞍形教育了孟县党的领导和全县的人民群众。
    由于批判了右倾保守思想，订出先进的指标和措施，孟县干部和群众干劲很大。小麦播种时，曾碰到百日无雨的旱情，可是全县人民鼓足干劲，出动九万人，打下了二十丈深的井，挖了十来里长的渠，苦战二十昼夜，抗旱点种了二十二万亩小麦。紧接着，他们又创造性地展开移栽麦苗的活动，使十六万亩缺苗地得到全苗。中间还战胜危害麦苗严重的小麦吸浆虫。到了小麦拔节孕穗阶段，他们又苦战四昼夜，出动三万人，在麦田里点起了八万处火熏烟，战胜了四次严重的霜冻。麦子快熟的时候，发生了一场大风暴雨，全县最好的麦都架设了天网，缚成麦把，防止了小麦倒伏。就这样，今年自然灾害虽然比往年大，但是在人们干劲冲天的情况下，小麦终于丰收了。
    （编者注：1957年全国小麦亩产最高的县是甘肃省张掖县，全县播种面积三十六万亩，平均亩产四百六十四点七斤。）
