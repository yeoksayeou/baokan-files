    Carry out Production and Construction in the Spirit of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
    Shanxi Agricultural Cooperatives Expand Public Accumulation
    Hubei Agricultural Cooperatives are Conducting Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution Work
    This newspaper reports that the broad masses of peasants in Shanxi Province, after the socialist great debate and rectification movement of the past winter and spring, especially after the vigorous publicity of the general line, have experienced an unprecedented improvement in their socialist consciousness. "Hard struggle for three years to change the face of the land" has become the unanimous action of the peasant masses. The vast majority of cooperatives are prepared to accelerate the pace of accumulation on the basis of increased production in agricultural cooperatives and increased income for members, and to actively expand the proportion of public accumulation in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, so that the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives can also achieve a great leap forward to meet the needs of the comprehensive great leap forward in industry and agriculture.
    Many cooperatives have already organized members to conduct debates and make plans. According to the investigation and statistics of some different types of cooperatives, it is preliminarily estimated that the total public accumulation (including public reserve fund and public welfare fund) of more than 24,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province can reach a huge sum of 100 million yuan this year, accounting for 8% of the total income of agricultural cooperatives this year. This figure will be more than double the public accumulation of last year and more than 70% of the total accumulation during the first five-year period. The 4,890 cooperatives in the Changzhi area will use more than 60% of the increased production this year to expand accumulation. The accumulation of cooperatives that have reached or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants will reach more than 90%. In this way, the total public accumulation in the entire area this year can reach more than 30 million yuan, a fourfold increase compared with 6 million yuan last year. Lu'an and Gaoping counties classify and rank agricultural cooperatives according to the increase in production and the original production level and living standards of the members. They plan to allocate about 5% of the increase to members of the first-class cooperatives (cooperatives that have exceeded and reached the level of well-to-do middle peasants); about 10% to members of general cooperatives; and about 20% to members of weak cooperatives. In this way, after three years, all cooperatives can exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants. The Qianjin Cooperative in Langbi Township, Qinshui County, after accounting for accumulation and consumption, the total income of the entire cooperative this year can reach 390,000 yuan, twice as much as last year. After deducting production costs and taxes of 102,300 yuan (26%), the expanded accumulation is 212,300 yuan (54%), more than ten times more than last year. Although the part allocated to members accounts for only 20% of the total income, it is actually 12,800 yuan more than last year. Adding in the return on investment of more than 11,300 yuan, the average income per person for the 1,134 people in the entire cooperative can reach 80 yuan, an increase of 20% compared with 67 yuan last year. Therefore, the members happily said: "The agricultural cooperative has a large accumulation, which has planted a rich root for us. In another three to five years, our income will definitely increase greatly." After a debate among all members, the Xijintun Xichengnan Cooperative in Jiexiu unanimously recognized that the faster and more public accumulation, the more assured the increase in production will be, and the better life can be lived. They decided to extract 3,800 yuan (24.5% of the total summer income) from this year's summer harvest to expand public accumulation. This figure is more than the total accumulation in the previous three years. Each of the 90 members of the cooperative still received an average of 84.2 yuan, an increase of 9.2% over the previous year. (Guo Zengji)
    This newspaper, Wuhan Electric Dispatch: The summer harvest pre-distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province has been universally launched. Hubei Province has generally achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops, and the issue of correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption and the relationship between the state, cooperatives, and members is very prominent. To this end, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on doing a good job in the summer harvest pre-distribution work. It requires party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over the summer harvest pre-distribution, correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption, correctly handle the relationship between the state, cooperatives, and members, resolutely implement the distribution policy of "to each according to his work", and conscientiously deal with the problems existing in the "three guarantees", which is the basic guarantee for improving the labor enthusiasm and creativity of members. The instructions require: When dealing with the "three guarantees" of summer crops, each cooperative can negotiate a certain proportion to reduce the original generally high production targets; it is not necessary to increase the generally low production targets; and appropriate adjustments should be made to the unreasonable production targets between teams with the consent of the members. According to the spirit of the provincial party committee's instructions, agricultural cooperatives in various places, while formulating pre-distribution plans, promptly publish accounts and mobilize the masses to conduct debates on accumulation and consumption issues, so that the pre-distribution not only ensures the necessary accumulation, but also appropriately meets the requirements of members. In terms of the distribution ratio, in general, on the basis of last year's summer harvest pre-distribution, 40%-60% of the increased production is distributed to members, and the rest is retained for public accumulation.
    This year, due to the expansion of paddy field area in Hubei, the rush to harvest and rush to plant agricultural work is more intense than in previous years. Therefore, in the distribution method, attention is paid to being simple and easy to implement, and closely centered on production. Members produce in the fields during the day, combined with brewing pre-distribution work; in the evening, combined with arranging and inspecting production, they discuss the opinions brewed during the day and conduct debates to deal with them. At present, the pre-distribution plans of various agricultural cooperatives have been formulated, and some cooperatives have already distributed part of the summer harvest grain to members.

    以多快好省的精神进行生产建设
    山西农业社扩大公共积累
    湖北各农业社正在进行夏收预分工作
    本报讯　山西省广大农民群众，经过去冬今春的社会主义大辩论和整风整社运动，特别是经过大张旗鼓的宣传总路线以后，社会主义觉悟空前提高。“苦战三年，改变面貌”已成为农民群众的一致行动。广大合作社都准备在农业社增加生产，社员增加收入的基础上，加快积累的脚步，以多快好省的精神，积极地扩大公共积累的比例，使农业社的公共积累也来一个大跃进，以适应工、农业全面大跃进的需要。
    许多合作社已经组织社员进行了辩论，作出了规划。根据一些不同类型社的调查、统计，初步预计，全省二万四千多个农业社的公共积累（包括公积金和公益金），今年可达一亿元之巨，占今年农业社总收入的8％。这个数字，将超过去年公共积累的一倍以上，比第一个五年期间积累总数的70％还多。长治专区四千八百九十个社，今年将把增产部分60％以上作为扩大积累，已经达到和超过富裕中农水平的社积累部分将达到90％以上，这样全专区今年的公共积累可达三千万元以上，比去年的六百万元提高四倍。潞安、高平等县根据农业社的增产幅度和社的原有生产水平、社员生活水平，进行分类排队，准备在一类社（已经超过和达到富裕中农水平的社）社员分配占增产部分的5％左右；在一般社占10％左右；薄弱社占20％左右。这样，经过三年，所有的合作社都可以超过富裕中农的水平。沁水县郎必乡前进社，经过积累与消费的算账规划，全社今年的收入总值可达三十九万元，比去年增加两倍，除去生产费用和税收十万二千三百元（占26％）外，扩大积累二十一万二千三百元（占54％），比去年增加十倍还多。社员分配部分虽然只占总收入的20％，实际上比去年还增加一万二千八百元，再加上投资返还一万一千三百多元，全社一千一百三十四口人，每人平均收入可达到八十元，比去年的六十七元提高20％。因此社员们高兴的说：“农业社积累大，给咱们栽上富根啦，再过三年到五年，收入定会大增加。”介休西靳屯下城南社，经过全体社员辩论，一致认识了公共积累越快越多，增产才会越有把握，生活也才能过得更好的道理，决定从今年的夏收中抽出三千八百元（占夏季总收入的24.5％）扩大公共积累，这个数字比前三年积累总和还多，而全社九十个社员，每个还平均收入到八十四元二角，比上年增加9.2％。（郭增基）
    本报武汉电　湖北省各地农业社的夏收预分工作，已经普遍展开。湖北省夏收作物普遍获得大丰收，正确处理积累和消费，国家、合作社和社员三者关系问题就很突出。为此中共湖北省委发出了关于做好夏收预分工作的指示。要求各级党委加强对夏收预分的领导，正确处理积累和消费的关系，正确处理国家、合作社和社员三者的关系，坚决贯彻执行“按劳取酬”的分配政策，认真处理“三包”中存在的问题，是提高社员劳动积极性和创造性的基本保证。指示要求：各社在处理夏收作物的“三包”问题时，对于原来包产指标普遍偏高的，可以议定一定的比例降低；包产指标普遍偏低的，就不必再去提高，队与队之间包产不合理的，要征得社员的同意，进行适当的调整。根据省委指示精神，各地农业社在制定预分方案同时，一面及时公布账目，一面发动群众就积累和消费问题进行了辩论，使预分既保证必要的积累，又能适当满足社员要求。在分配比例上，一般是在去年夏收预分基础上，将增产部分的40％—60％分配给社员，其余留作公共积累。
    今年湖北因水田面积扩大，抢收、抢种的农活较往年更为紧张，因此在分配方法上，都注意到简便易行，密切围绕生产。社员白天在田间生产，结合酝酿预分工作；晚间结合安排检查生产，讨论白天酝酿的意见，进行辩论处理。目前各农业社预分方案都已制定好，有的社已经把部分的夏收粮食分到社员手里。
