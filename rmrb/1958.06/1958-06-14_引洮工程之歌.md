    With surging drive, the mountains tremble
    With surging drive, the mountains tremble,
    With a swing of the shovel, water ascends the mountain,
    Two shoulder-loads irrigate ten thousand mu of fields,
    Wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning obey our command.

    Rice flowers will bloom on the mountaintop
    Drawing the Tao River up the mountain is a rare feat,
    Arid regions are transformed into fertile land,
    The great water rushes up the mountain with a whoosh,
    Rice flowers will bloom on the mountaintop.

    Following in the footsteps of the Red Army
    Feet braced on the rocky cliffs,
    Hands gripping steel shovels,
    Splitting mountains and filling gullies,
    Fighting on the Min Mountains.

    Unafraid of wind and rain,
    Unafraid of the steep rocks,
    We must follow in the footsteps of the Red Army,
    And lead the Tao River onto the Min Mountains.

    引洮工程之歌
    鼓起干劲山动弹
    鼓起干劲山动弹，
    铁锹一挥水上山，
    两担挑起了万亩田，
    风云雷电听使唤。
    山顶要扬水稻花
    引洮上山多稀罕，
    干旱地区变良田，
    大水上山哗啦啦，
    山顶要扬水稻花。
    跟着红军的脚步
    脚蹬石崖，
    手拿钢铲，
    劈山填沟，
    战斗在岷山。
    不怕风和雨，
    不怕崖石坚，
    要跟着红军的脚步，
    把洮河引上岷山。
