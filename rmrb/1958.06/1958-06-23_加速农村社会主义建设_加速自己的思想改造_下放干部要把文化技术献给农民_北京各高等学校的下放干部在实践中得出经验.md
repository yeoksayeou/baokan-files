    Accelerate Socialist Construction in Rural Areas Accelerate Ideological Remolding
    Cadres Sent to Lower Levels Should Dedicate Culture and Technology to Farmers
    Experiences Gained by Cadres from Beijing Colleges and Universities Sent to Lower Levels in Practice
    (Our Reporter Zhu Bin reports) Cadres sent to lower levels should contribute culture and technology to farmers while participating in physical labor in the countryside. This will not only accelerate socialist construction in rural areas but also benefit their own ideological remolding. This is the experience gained by cadres from Beijing colleges and universities sent to lower levels from practice.
    The Higher Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee held a meeting of heads of cadres sent to lower levels from various schools last week. Cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Renmin University of China, and other schools introduced their achievements and experiences at the meeting.
    Helping farmers reform agricultural tools, build factories, and run schools will enable the countryside to rapidly realize industrialization and eliminate illiteracy.
    Three hundred and forty-five cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University arrived in Zhaizhai Township and Qingshui Township in Mentougou District in early January this year. While engaging in physical labor, they assisted farmers in reforming 41 agricultural tools and trial-produced products such as pigments, activated carbon, paper, rayon, insecticides, and white wine from green walnut skins, walnut shells, linden bark, reed leaves, and rotten sweet potatoes that local farmers had not utilized in the past. A granular fertilizer factory, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer factory, and a bone fertilizer factory have already been built. More than 30 factories, including an iron smelting plant, a cement plant, an activated carbon plant, a refractory material plant, a tannin extraction plant, a hydropower station, and a medicine processing plant, are now under construction or planned for construction. They use local materials and simple equipment to trial-produce these products and build these factories. The equipment used to trial-produce rayon, paper, and other products consists only of a briquette stove, two old washbasins, and several bottles. The bone fertilizer factory they built with the farmers consists of two pots and a stone mill set up on a hillside. In the activities of popularizing culture and scientific knowledge, in addition to everyone participating in literacy work, they also established 11 middle and primary schools and three red and expert schools, and also held various professional training classes. In the red and expert schools, they are teachers and also students of the old farmers. According to the secretary of the Mentougou District Committee, rapidly and more systematically bringing into play the role of farmers' assistants - the knowledge of intellectuals sent to lower levels, will enable the entire district to realize industrialization this year. One hundred and seventy-eight cadres from Beijing Normal University sent to Yongfengtun Township in Changping District helped local farmers popularize cultural knowledge, enabling 30% of the more than 2,300 illiterate people to recognize 1,500 characters, and the rest will basically be able to remove the hat of illiteracy before "October 1" this year. In addition to helping farmers run agricultural middle schools and red and expert universities, they also promoted farmers to carry out literary and artistic creation, singing, and drama activities, making this township a culturally advanced township. Cadres sent to lower levels from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology also helped local farmers build a chemical fertilizer factory and an agricultural tool repair factory using charcoal as raw material. The bulldozer and wheat harvester they and the farmers transformed from a double-wheeled double-furrow plow increased efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual labor. Now they are helping local farmers build an alloy steel plant.
    The meeting believes that although these tasks have not been carried out widely or universally in the past, the role they play in the economic and cultural construction of the countryside can already be seen. If more than 7,000 cadres from more than 30 colleges and universities take immediate action from now on, consciously dedicate all their cultural and technical knowledge to farmers while engaging in physical labor, it is conceivable that the socialist construction of the countryside will be greatly accelerated.
    It is not necessary to emphasize combining with individuals' original majors, but rather to first obey the needs of the current construction in rural areas.
    The meeting also believes that cadres sent to lower levels should not emphasize combining with individuals' original majors in assisting farmers in carrying out technological and cultural revolutions. They should first obey the needs of the current construction in rural areas. If they can combine with their majors, they should give play to their professional expertise; if they cannot combine with their majors, they should learn and do at the same time according to actual needs. The experience gained by cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University proves that this is entirely possible. Here, Song Shaobin, a female translator who used to specialize in foreign languages, has become a doctor who can treat sheep and pigs. A young teacher who used to specialize in history has become a modifier of automatic waterwheels. Young teachers who studied philosophy and mathematics have undertaken the entire design, construction, and installation of hydropower stations. There are also staff members who used to work in general affairs who have created cranes here.
    Carrying out cultural and technical activities while exercising through physical labor can accelerate ideological remolding.
    The meeting also believes that carrying out these cultural and technical activities while exercising through physical labor can accelerate ideological remolding. Cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University use many specific facts to illustrate that doing so is in itself a test of the sense of responsibility of cadres sent to lower levels to serve the farmers. And in the process of these activities, people will be promoted to break away from bourgeois individualism more quickly and establish the concept of serving the working people wholeheartedly. The work of cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University in using walnut shells to trial-produce activated carbon is a vivid example. Initially, they assigned this experimental work to a person who had no feelings for the countryside and who tried to avoid difficulties everywhere to make himself comfortable. This person lived in the city for a month and visited a regularized factory. Then he concluded that the work of producing activated carbon was too complicated and that there were no conditions in the countryside to do it, and thus ended this work. The second time, two people were sent. They saw in the book that walnut shells were too hard to make, and they also heard that a professor had this view, so they hastily did a few experiments and then concluded that this experiment was hopeless. The third time, everyone reassigned Liang Sicui, a Communist Party member who loved farmers and was determined to contribute her strength to rural construction, to continue this experiment, and the situation changed. She failed once, found the reason, and then experimented a second time, continuing more than 50 times until she found the production law for making activated carbon. The equipment she used was only three bottles and a stove. Now, according to the results she provided to build a factory, 100 pounds of walnut shells, which are worth only 30 cents, can be turned into 10 pounds of activated carbon worth more than 60 yuan by using some simple equipment. This fierce struggle educated the people who participated in this work and educated everyone that if they do not hurry up and make themselves "red," their original skills and knowledge will not be able to truly contribute to the people.
    Practical activities can greatly accelerate the overcoming of the common problem of knowledge and intellectuals being divorced from reality.
    The meeting believes that these practical activities can also greatly accelerate the overcoming of the common problem of knowledge and intellectuals being divorced from reality and establish a dialectical materialist epistemology. Many teachers among the cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University used to despise practice and loved to find research topics from literature. Some people even spent a year without finding a suitable research topic. When they came to the mountain villages in Mentougou District, as soon as they carried out cultural and technical activities, they found that research topics were waving to you everywhere. In more than two months, they used their spare time from labor to successfully study the methods of making wine from rotten sweet potatoes, activated carbon from walnut shells, and rayon from linden bark. These research results are of great value to the development of China's light industry and chemical industry. In addition, they also discovered blue-stem grass and green-green teeth that can be used to manufacture insecticides, providing two new research objects for botany. Now their research work, which starts from reality and serves production, has not only changed the views of reality of those who directly participated in these tasks, but also attracted the attention of many teachers on the Peking University campus to this mountainous area. Now Peking University has decided to establish a research institute here.
    The meeting also believes that the cultural and technical activities carried out by cadres sent to lower levels from various schools must be carried out under the unified leadership and unified planning of the local Party committee. At the same time, they must also cooperate with farmers and adopt various methods to quickly help farmers master this cultural and technical knowledge.
    This meeting was held at the location of the cadres sent to lower levels from Peking University. While discussing, they also conducted visits. Everyone who attended expressed that they would immediately convey the spirit after returning, mobilize and organize all the cadres sent to lower levels from various schools to contribute their cultural and technical knowledge to the farmers, establish a close relationship with the farmers in accelerating the socialist construction of the countryside, and leave their handprints and footprints permanently in the local construction.

    加速农村社会主义建设  加速自己的思想改造
    下放干部要把文化技术献给农民
    北京各高等学校的下放干部在实践中得出经验
    本报讯  记者朱彬报道：下放干部在农村参加体力劳动的同时，应当把文化和技术贡献给农民，这样做不但可以加速农村的社会主义建设，而且有益于自己的思想改造。这是北京各高等学校的下放干部从实践中得出的经验。
    中共北京市委高等学校委员会在上周举行各校下放干部负责人会议，北京大学、北京师范大学、人民大学等校的下放干部都在会上介绍了各自取得的成绩和经验。
    帮助农民改革农具，建工厂，办学校，将使农村迅速实现工业化和扫除文盲。
    北京大学三百四十五名下放干部，在今年1月初来到门头沟区斋堂乡和清水乡。他们在从事体力劳动的同时协助农民改革了四十一项生产工具，把当地农民过去没有利用起来的青核桃皮、核桃硬壳、椴树皮、芦叶子草、烂白薯等试制成了颜料、活性炭、纸张、人造棉、杀虫药、白酒等产品。已经建设了颗粒肥料厂、固氮菌肥料厂、骨肥厂，现在正在建设或计划建设的有炼铁厂、水泥厂、活性炭厂、耐火器材厂、单宁提取工厂、水电站、药品加工厂等三十多个工厂。他们试制这些产品、建设这些工厂，不仅原料就地取材，设备也因陋就简。试制人造棉、纸张等产品所用的设备就只有一个煤球炉子、两个旧洗脸盆和几只瓶子。他们和农民一起建设的骨肥厂就是在山坡上置起的两只锅和一个石磨。在普及文化和科学知识的活动中，他们除了人人参加扫盲工作外，还举办了十一所中学和小学，三所红专学校，还举办了各种专业的训练班。在红专学校里，他们是教师，也是老农的学生。据门头沟区委书记谈，迅速地更有计划地发挥农民的助手——下放知识分子的作用，就可使全区在今年内实现工业化。北京师范大学下放到昌平区永丰屯乡的一百七十八名干部协助当地农民普及文化知识，已使二千三百多名文盲中30％的人认识了一千五百字，其余的人在今年“十一”前也基本上可全部摘掉文盲的帽子。他们除了帮助农民举办农业中学、红专大学外，还推动农民开展文艺创作、歌咏、戏剧活动。使得这个乡已成为文化先进乡。北京钢铁学院的下放干部也帮助当地农民建设了用草木炭作原料的化肥厂和农具修理厂。他们和农民一起用双轮双铧犁改造成的推土机、小麦收割机比手工效率提高了十多倍。现在他们正在帮助当地的农民建设合金钢厂。
    会议认为这些工作过去开展的虽还不广泛不普遍，但已可看出对农村的经济和文化建设所起的作用。如果从现在起三十多个高等学校的七千多干部都立即行动起来，自觉地在从事体力劳动的同时把自己的所有文化、技术知识都贡献给农民，可以想像，农村的社会主义建设将会大大地加快。
    不应该强调结合个人原有的专业，要首先服从农村当前建设的需要。
    会议还认为下放干部在协助农民进行技术革命、文化革命的工作中不应强调结合各人原有的专业，应该首先服从农村当前建设的需要，能和专业结合的就发挥专业的特长，不能和自己的专业结合的，应该按照实际需要一面学一面做。北京大学下放干部所取得的经验证明这是完全可以做到的。在这里过去专长外语的女翻译工作者宋绍彬成了能治羊和猪的大夫。过去专长历史的青年教师成了自动水车的改装人。学哲学和数学的青年教师担任了水电站的全部设计、施工、安装的工作。还有过去担任总务工作的职员在这里也创造了起重机。
    下放干部在体力劳动锻炼的同时，开展文化技术活动，可以加速思想改造。
    会议还认为，下放干部在从事体力劳动锻炼的同时，开展这些文化技术活动，可以加速思想改造。北京大学下放干部以许多具体事实说明这样做的本身就是对下放干部为农民服务的责任心的考验。而在这些活动的过程中又会推动人们更快地破除资产阶级个人主义，树立全心全意为劳动人民服务的观点。北京大学下放干部利用核桃壳试制活性炭的工作就是一个生动的例子。最初他们把这项试验工作交给一个对农村还没有感情，而且处处图个人轻松逃避困难的人去做。这个人到城里住了一个月，参观了一个正规化的工厂，于是就下结论说，生产活性炭的工作太复杂，农村里没有条件搞，就此结束了这项工作。第二次派去了两个人，他们看到书本上说核桃壳太硬不易做成，又听到有位教授也有这种看法，草草地做了几次试验后也下结论说这项试验没有希望。第三次大家重派一位热爱农民决心为农村建设贡献自己力量的共产党员梁思萃来继续这项试验，情况就变了样。她一次失败了，寻找出原因再第二次试验，一直继续了五十多次，直到找到了制成活性炭的生产规律为止。她所用的设备不过三个瓶子和一个炉子。现在按照她所提供的结果来建厂，一百斤只值三角钱的核桃壳利用一些简单的设备加以制造就可变成十斤价值六十多元的活性炭。这一场激烈的斗争教育了参加这项工作的人，教育了大家：如果再不赶快使自己“红”起来，原有的那些技术和知识也不可能真正对人民有所贡献。
    通过实践活动可以大大加速下放的知识分子克服理论脱离实际的通病。
    会议认为通过这些实践活动还可以大大加速下放的知识分子克服理论脱离实际的通病，树立辩证唯物主义的认识论。北京大学下放干部中有不少教师过去轻视实际，爱从文献中找研究题目，有的人甚至花了一年时间还找不到一个适当的研究题目。他们来到门头沟区的山村里，一展开文化和技术活动就发现研究题目到处在向你招手。在两个多月时间里，他们利用劳动的空余时间就研究成功了用烂白薯制酒、核桃壳制活性炭和椴树皮制人造棉的方法，这些研究成果在我国轻工业和化学工业发展方面有很大价值。另外他们还发现了可以制造杀虫药的蓝茎草、绿绿牙，为植物学提供了两个新的研究对象。现在他们这些从实际出发为生产服务而开展的研究工作，不仅使他们直接参与这些工作的人改变了对实际的看法，而且还吸引了北京大学校内的不少教师对这个山区的注意。现在北京大学已决定在这里建立研究所。
    会议还认为各校的下放干部开展这些文化和技术活动必须在当地党委的统一领导和统一计划下进行。同时也必须和农民共同合作，采取各种方法迅速地帮助农民掌握这些文化和技术知识。
    这次会议是在北京大学下放干部所在地举行的，一面讨论一面进行了参观，到会的人都纷纷表示回去后马上传达，动员组织各校所有的下放干部把自己的文化和技术知识贡献给农民，从加速农村的社会主义建设中和农民结成血肉相联的亲密关系，使自己的手印和脚印永远地留在当地的建设中。
