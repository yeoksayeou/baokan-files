    Learning from Guan Hanqing and Surpassing Guan Hanqing
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Today we commemorate Guan Hanqing, our great playwright, and peace-loving people all over the world are also holding commemorations for him sooner or later. We commemorate him because his drama creations seven hundred years ago made a great contribution to progressive human culture.
    Guan Hanqing was a folk playwright in China in the 13th century. He was also an outstanding warrior who used artistic weapons to attack the feudal society fiercely.
    In Guan Hanqing's time, the ruling classes of Mongolia, Jurchen, and Han nationalities waged continuous wars for decades within China. In the flames of war, the originally highly developed feudal economy was severely damaged, and the people were displaced, died, or were captured as slaves. In his famous play "The Pavilion of Worshipping the Moon," Guan Hanqing profoundly condemned the rulers' wars. Through the complaint of the heroine Wang Ruilan, he used "dragons fighting and fish getting hurt" to summarize the people's rebellious emotions at that time.
    In Guan Hanqing's time, China was under the rule of slave-owning aristocrats, privileged classes ran rampant, and corrupt officials committed evil. The people were not only subjected to the most cruel exploitation, but even lost their most basic human rights. In that society, there was no justice, no righteousness. Therefore, it aroused the resistance of the broad masses of the people, and the flags of the Red Turban Army against the feudal ruling class were planted all over the mountains of China. It was at this time that Guan Hanqing used the artistic form of zaju (variety play) as a weapon to bravely and ruthlessly criticize the sinful ruling class. From emperors and imperial relatives to landlords and bullies, as long as they oppressed the good, they were all the objects of his criticism. But Guan Hanqing's vision did not stagnate on certain villains. His keen observation enabled him to touch upon many fundamental issues in the social life of the 13th century in his works. In many plays, he essentially opposed all aspects of the feudal system. The tyrannical patriarchal system and the inhumane prostitution system were his frequent targets of attack. In his famous tragedy "Dou E's Injustice," Guan Hanqing fiercely condemned the fact that the law could not protect the good and justice, that officials were just muddleheaded fools who accepted bribes and perverted the law, and even the heavenly gods and goddesses most revered by feudal society were accused of being blind by the wronged young widow Dou E. Guan Hanqing's thoroughness and ferocity in opposing the evil rule of feudalism are rare among classical writers.
    Guan Hanqing was a great warrior with a democratic spirit. This is not only manifested in his criticism of the feudal system, but also in the fact that what he sympathized with and praised in his works were the oppressed and humble figures, especially women who suffered from heavy oppression. For example, maids, wet nurses, prostitutes, and remarried widows were important positive characters in his plays, and sometimes they were written as heroic figures. He wholeheartedly praised the wisdom, bravery, kindness, vigor, and tenacity of these minor characters discriminated against by the ruling class. No matter how complex and arduous the struggle was, no matter how powerful the feudal oppression was, Guan Hanqing always depicted the optimism and confidence of these unfortunate people, and always allowed them to achieve victory in the end. In the excellent comedies "Saving the Prostitute" and "Looking at the River Pavilion," he convincingly depicted these oppressed women actually turning their hands to control the fate of the bullies. He had infinite sympathy for the unfortunate who suffered, and believed that they would definitely be able to find a good way out. Humanism and optimism are unified in Guan Hanqing. Realism and romanticism are also unified in Guan Hanqing's works.
    In that dark era, the law clearly stipulated that arbitrarily composing lyrics and songs, or making offensive remarks, would be punished by beheading or exile. However, in order to sympathize with the oppressed people, Guan Hanqing maintained the noble conscience of an artist and fearlessly inserted his pen into the chest of the feudal rulers.
    Zaju is the earliest dramatic form in our country with the most profound influence. This folk art loved by the people has been rendered and improved by Guan Hanqing and his Shuhui (book club) friends such as Yang Xianzhi and other progressive playwrights, and it has occupied a brilliant page in the history of drama and even in the history of literature in our country. At that time, people engaged in this artistic work were discriminated against, and their names were "not allowed to be ranked alongside celebrities." However, Guan Hanqing and his Shuhui friends were willing to serve the people and devoted their lives to folk art activities. Guan Hanqing's immortal plays were mostly written under the mutual discussion and revision of his Shuhui friends. Today, when we commemorate Guan Hanqing here, it should be said that we are also commemorating a group of progressive playwrights headed by Guan Hanqing seven hundred years ago.
    In the past, Guan Hanqing's achievements were underestimated. For example, Zhu Quan, a royal drama critic in the Ming Dynasty, said that he was "a talent that could be both high and low." Guan Hanqing's plays rarely had opportunities to be staged in the old society. He wrote sixty-six plays, but only eighteen original scripts have been preserved. But the people will never forget the artistic master who was the soul, the heart, the throat, the hands and feet of the people, who fought for the people, and sought a happy life for the people, like Guan Hanqing, and the contributions he made. After the founding of New China, the people mastered their own destiny and became the masters of the country. Guan Hanqing's existing works, which were previously only used as desk offerings by a few experts, are not only very active on the stage, but also several plays have been adapted into movies. Tonight, at least one hundred different forms of drama and one thousand five hundred professional theater troupes in China are simultaneously staging Guan Hanqing's plays. This is an unprecedented grand occasion. Furthermore, in terms of research on Guan Hanqing, the number of papers on Guan Hanqing published in our country's newspapers and periodicals in the year from May last year to May this year not only exceeds the total number in the forty years before liberation, but also exceeds the total number in the past seven hundred years. Such facts prove that in our country where the people are masters of their own affairs, progressive artistic heritage with a people's nature is being protected and promoted with all our strength.
    Guan Hanqing's creation is an unattainable peak in the history of human art. The reason why it is unattainable is that the era he lived in is gone forever, and he has perfectly reflected that era and cast a group of monuments of the old era. Guan Hanqing's unattainability is like Shakespeare's unattainability, but he was hundreds of years earlier. We are proud to have a playwright like Guan Hanqing, but the spiritual wealth created by Guan Hanqing should not be exclusively owned by the Chinese people. Guan Hanqing is not only the Guan Hanqing of China, but the Guan Hanqing of all mankind. We are very happy that peace-loving friends from all over the world are commemorating him and introducing his most valuable art to the people of the world. We are very happy that the labor creation of Guan Hanqing, our Chinese drama master, has gradually become the common spiritual wealth of progressive human beings in the world.
    Our country is currently in an era of great leap forward in socialist construction for the whole people. When we commemorate Guan Hanqing, we should learn from his spirit of serving the people, love what the people love, hate what the people hate, closely connect with the people, and fight tenaciously to implement the general line of socialist construction. What is the current international situation? Everyone knows that the people of the world demand peaceful coexistence and an immediate ban on weapons of mass destruction, while the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism are doing everything possible to plan new wars. They want to enslave mankind and use atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs to blackmail. But we believe that the imperialists are digging their own graves, the power of the people is invincible, and no one can reverse the wheels of historical development. Please see that the United States, Britain, France and other countries of the imperialist bloc are not struggling desperately under a serious economic crisis? When we commemorate Guan Hanqing here, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite, weighing one thousand three hundred and twenty-seven kilograms, is leisurely running in the sky day and night. What does this mean? It means the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. The productivity and creativity of the people are greatly liberated under the socialist system, and all undertakings are leaping forward at supersonic speed. The force of peace is bound to defeat war!
    Let us learn from Guan Hanqing and surpass Guan Hanqing; for the happiness of mankind and for lasting world peace, let us give full play to our high level of initiative and creativity in all posts, and leap forward forever, a great leap forward!

    学习关汉卿，并超过关汉卿
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席 中国文学艺术界联合会主席 郭沫若
    今天我们纪念我国伟大剧作家关汉卿，全世界爱好和平的人士也都或先或后地在为他举行纪念。我们纪念他，是因为在七百年前他的戏剧创作，对于进步的人类文化作出了巨大贡献。
    关汉卿是我国十三世纪的一位民间戏剧家。他也是拿着艺术武器向封建社会猛攻的杰出的战士。
    关汉卿的时代，蒙古、女真和汉族的统治阶级，在中国境内连续不断地进行了几十年的战争，在战火中，原有高度发达的封建经济遭到严重破坏，人民流离死亡，或者被俘为奴隶。关汉卿在他的名剧“拜月亭”中就对统治者们的战伐，作了深刻的谴责。他通过女主人翁王瑞兰的控诉，用“龙斗鱼伤”来概括了当时人民的反抗情绪。
    关汉卿的时代，中国处在奴隶主贵族统治下，特权阶级横行，贪官污吏作恶，人民不仅受着最残酷的剥削，甚至丧失了最基本的各项人权。在那个社会中，没有公理，没有正义。因此，激起了广大人民群众的反抗，反对封建统治阶级的红巾军旗帜，插遍了中国的山头。正是在这个时候，关汉卿用着杂剧这种艺术形式作武器，勇敢的、无情的抨击着罪恶的统治阶级。上至皇帝和皇亲国戚，下至地主恶霸，只要是欺压善良的，都是他抨击的对象。但关汉卿的目光，没有停滞于某些恶人身上，他深刻的观察力，使他在作品中触及十三世纪社会生活中的许多根本性的问题。他在许多剧本中，实质上反对了封建制度的各个方面。横暴的家长制度和惨无人道的娼妓制度，就是他经常攻击的目标，关汉卿在他有名的悲剧“窦娥冤”中，猛烈的谴责了王法不能保护善良和正义，官吏只是贪赃枉法的糊涂虫，连封建社会最尊奉的天地神祗，也被蒙冤的年轻寡妇窦娥斥为没有眼睛。关汉卿反对封建罪恶统治的彻底性和猛烈程度，在古典作家中是少见的。
    关汉卿是一位有民主主义精神的伟大战士。这不仅表现在他对封建制度的抨击上面，更表现在他的作品里所同情、所歌颂的都是被压迫的地位低微的人物，特别是受着重重压迫的妇女。例如，婢女、乳娘、妓女、再嫁的寡妇，更是他剧作中重要的正面人物，有时还被写成为英雄人物。他尽情的歌颂着这些被统治阶级歧视的小人物的机智、勇敢、善良、泼辣、顽强的品格。不问斗争是多么复杂、艰辛，不问封建压迫多么强大，关汉卿总是描写出这些不幸者的乐观和信心，总是让他们在最后获得胜利。在出色的喜剧“救风尘”、“望江亭”中，他令人信服的描写了这些被压迫的妇女，竟然翻手掌握了恶霸们的命运。他对受苦受难的不幸者有无限的同情，相信他们一定能够寻求到美好的出路。人道主义和乐观主义精神，在关汉卿身上是统一的。现实主义和浪漫主义精神，在关汉卿作品中也是统一的。
    在那黑暗的时代，法律明文规定，妄撰词曲，犯上恶言，是要被判杀头或流放的。但是，为了同情被压迫人民，关汉卿却保持了艺术家的高贵的良心，毫无畏惧地把笔锋插入了封建统治者的胸膛中去。
    杂剧是我国最有深远影响的早期戏剧形式。这种受人民喜爱的民间艺术经过了关汉卿和他的书会朋友们如杨显之等一批进步剧作家的渲染提高，在我国戏剧史乃至文学史中便占有了光辉灿烂的一页。在当时，从事这项艺术工作的人，是被歧视的，他们的名字竟“不得和名士并列”。但关汉卿和他的书会朋友们，却宁肯为人民服务，以毕生精力从事民间艺术活动，关汉卿的不朽剧作，大都是在他的书会朋友们互相讨论修改下写出来的。今天我们在这里纪念关汉卿，应当说，同时也是在纪念七百年前以关汉卿为首的一批进步戏剧家们。
    在过去，关汉卿的成就是被低贬的。例如，明代的皇族戏剧批评家朱权就说他是“可上可下之材”。关汉卿的剧本在旧社会中，很少有上演机会，他写了六十六个剧本，只保存下来十八部原本。但人民永远不会忘记像关汉卿这样做人民的灵魂、人民的心脏、人民的喉舌、人民的手足，为人民作斗争、为人民寻求美满生活道路的艺术大师和他所作出的贡献的。新中国成立以后，人民掌握了自己的命运，作了国家的主人，以前只为少数专家用作案头供奉的关汉卿的现存作品，不仅在舞台上十分活跃，而且有好几个剧本经过改编后已拍成电影。今天晚上，中国至少有一百种不同的戏剧形式，一千五百个职业剧团，都在同时上演关汉卿的剧本，这是亘古未有的盛况。再就关于关汉卿的研究方面来说，从去年5月到今年5月的一年中，我国报刊上所发表的研究关汉卿的论文数量，不仅超过了解放前四十年的总数，而且超过了七百年来的总数。这样的事实证明，在人民当家作主的我国，对于富有人民性的、进步的艺术遗产是在不遗余力地加以保护和发扬的。
    关汉卿的创作是人类艺术史上不可企及的一个高峰。其所以不可企及，是因为他所处的那个时代已经一去不复返了，而他却尽善地把那个时代反映了出来，铸造了一群旧时代的纪念碑。关汉卿的不可企及也就如莎士比亚的不可企及一样，而他却又更早几百年。我们以有关汉卿这样的戏剧家而骄傲，但关汉卿所创造的精神财富是不应当专为中国人民所有的。关汉卿不但是中国的关汉卿，而是全人类的关汉卿。我们非常高兴，全世界爱好和平的各国朋友们都在纪念他，并把他最宝贵的艺术介绍给世界人民。我们非常高兴，我国戏剧大师关汉卿的劳动创造已经逐步成为世界进步人类共同的精神财富了。
    我国目前正处在全国人民为建设社会主义大跃进的时代，我们纪念关汉卿，就应该学习他那种为人民服务的精神，爱人民之所爱，憎人民之所憎，和人民紧密联系，为实践建设社会主义的总路线而顽强战斗。目前的国际形势又是怎样呢？大家都知道，全世界的人民要求和平共处，立即禁止大量毁灭性的武器，而以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力，却正在千方百计的策划新战争，他们要奴役人类，用原子弹、氢弹来进行讹诈。但我们相信，帝国主义者是在自己挖掘自己的坟墓，人民的力量是不可战胜的，历史发展的车轮是谁也不能使它逆转的。请看帝国主义集团的美、英、法等国不是早在严重的经济危机之下拼命挣扎吗？当我们在这里纪念着关汉卿的时候，重量一千三百二十七公斤的苏联第三颗人造卫星，悠悠然，日日夜夜地在天上运行，这意味着什么？意味着社会主义制度的无比的优越性。人民的生产力和创造力，在社会主义制度下得到大解放，一切事业都在以超音速的速度飞跃前进。和平的力量是必然战胜战争的！
    让我们学习关汉卿，并超过关汉卿；为了人类的幸福，为了世界的持久和平，让我们在各个岗位上，全心全意地发挥高度的积极性和创造性，永远地跃进，大跃进！
