Chongqing, June 3rd (from our newspaper) Chongqing's newly built factories have universally implemented a relatively fixed labor contract system this year when recruiting new workers. These factories directly sign fixed-term labor contracts with agricultural cooperatives, scattered workers in the streets, and residents, stipulating that after the contract expires, a decision will be made based on the factory's production needs whether to continue working in the factory or return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, in order to more rationally utilize labor and further strengthen the relationship between workers and peasants.

The labor force of Chongqing's newly built factories mainly comes from the countryside, and there is a very close relationship between the use of labor and agricultural production. More than ten factories that have already signed contracts with agricultural cooperatives generally stipulate labor terms of six months or one year, and two and a half to three years for apprentices. After the contract expires, if the factory needs it for production, the labor contract will be renewed; if not, they will return to the agricultural cooperative. Some factories stipulate that during the busy farming season, the factory can also grant agricultural leave without affecting normal factory production. During the period when agricultural cooperative members participate in labor in the factory, they still retain the rights and obligations of cooperative members, and pay public accumulation funds and public welfare funds to the agricultural cooperative according to their wage income, so that the income of the agricultural cooperative will not be affected. After the workers return to the agricultural cooperative, they are still the factory's reserve labor force, and have priority to enter the factory in the future when the factory needs them.

The implementation of this new labor method is deeply welcomed by factories, agricultural cooperatives, and laborers. The Sanjiang Iron and Steel Plant plans to recruit more than 2,000 workers needed after the completion of the first phase of the project. In addition to the 500 to 600 major technical workers such as steelmakers and rollers, about 70% of the general workers, ordinary workers, apprentices, odd-job workers, etc. are all recruited by contract. The factory has now recruited nearly 300 apprentices. The factory feels that the implementation of the contract system ensures the source of labor, and when production changes require reducing workers, they can be properly安置 at any time, without wasting a single person. At the same time, there are fewer fixed workers, and most of the contract workers live in nearby rural areas, so they do not need to bring their families into the factory. Therefore, this factory needs to build more than 1,000 fewer family residences. Calculating only 1,000 households, at least 500,000 yuan of factory construction investment can be saved. When this factory discussed with the local agricultural cooperative, the agricultural cooperative believed that the factory did not fix the workers, and surplus people could return to the countryside at any time, which is very convenient for the rural areas to adjust the use of labor; at the same time, after the implementation of the contract system, farmers can also take turns in batches to the factory to learn industrial production, which is of great benefit to promoting the improvement of agricultural production technology and changing the political ideology of farmers. Cooperative members also feel that being both farmers and workers can not only learn two sets of production skills, but also engage in different labor according to their specific conditions, which is very beneficial to themselves and the country.

In terms of wage standards, welfare, and labor protection for newly recruited workers, these factories have also made some regulations suitable for the new urban-rural relationship and the worker-peasant relationship, starting from the worker-peasant relationship and the current actual situation. After discussion with the agricultural cooperative, the Beibei Iron Smelting Plant stipulated that the monthly wage income of general technical workers should be 30 yuan, which is lower than the current general wage level in Chongqing, but about 12 yuan higher than the monthly income of the stronger members of the local agricultural cooperative. The agricultural cooperative believes that this can encourage members to participate in industrial production without causing a blind influx into factories. In terms of labor protection, the labor contract stipulates that in addition to the necessary labor facilities related to safety and health, generally no excessive demands are made. For example, expenses for illnesses, injuries, and deaths caused by workers on duty are basically borne by the factory, and expenses for illnesses, injuries, and deaths not caused by work are basically resolved by the individuals themselves, without excessively exceeding the labor insurance benefits of agricultural cooperative members.

### 新工厂用新办法招新工人  重庆推行劳动合同制

　　新工厂用新办法招新工人
    重庆推行劳动合同制
    本报重庆3日电　重庆市新建工厂今年在招收新工人时，普遍实行了相对固定的劳动合同制。这些工厂和农业社、街道零散工人、居民等直接签订定期劳动合同，规定合同期满后再根据工厂生产需要决定继续留厂或回农村参加农业生产，以便更合理地利用劳动力和进一步密切工农关系。
    重庆市新建工厂的劳动力主要来自农村，在劳动力的使用上和农业生产有很密切的关系。目前已经和农业社签订合同的十多个工厂，规定的劳动期限一般是半年或一年，学徒工两年半到三年。合同期满后，如果工厂生产需要，就继续签订劳动合同，不需要时仍回农业社。有的厂规定，农忙时在不影响工厂正常生产的情况下，工厂还可以放农忙假。农业社社员在工厂参加劳动期间，仍保留社员的权利和义务，并根据工资收入情况向农业社缴纳公积金和公益金，使农业社收入不致受到影响。工人回到农业社后仍为工厂后备劳动力，将来工厂需要时有优先进厂的权利。
    实行这种新的劳动办法深受工厂、农业社和劳动者的欢迎。三江钢铁厂计划第一期工程完工后所需要的二千多名工人，除了五、六百名炼钢、轧钢等主要技术工人外，其余70％左右的一般工人、普通工、学徒工、勤杂工等全部都用合同方式招收，现在厂里已招收了近三百名学徒工。工厂感到，实行合同制劳动力来源既有保证，而在生产变动需要减少工人时又可随时得到适当安置，不至于浪费一个人。同时固定工人少，合同工人大多数家都住在附近农村，不必带家属进厂，因此这个厂就要少建一千多人的家属住宅。仅以一千户住宅计算，至少都可节约五十万元建厂投资。这个厂在和当地农业社讨论时，农业社认为，工厂不把工人固定下来，多余的人随时可以回到农村，对农村调剂劳动力的使用很方便；同时实行合同制后，农民还可分批轮换到工厂学习工业生产，对促进农业生产技术的改进和改变农民政治思想有极大好处。社员也感到亦农亦工，既可学会两套生产本领，又可根据自己具体条件从事不同的劳动，对自己，对国家都很有利。
    这些工厂在新招工人的工资标准、生活福利、劳动保护等方面，也从工农关系和当前实际情况出发作了一些适合新的城乡关系和工农关系的规定。北碚炼铁厂和农业社讨论后，规定一般技术工人每月工资收入为三十元，虽然比重庆市目前一般工资水平较低，但比当地农业社较强社员每月收入要高十二元左右。农业社认为，这样可以鼓励社员参加工业生产，又不致引起盲目流入工厂。在劳动保护方面，劳动合同规定除有关安全、健康等必需的劳动设施外，一般也不作过高要求。如工人因公造成的病、伤、死亡等开支费用基本上由工厂负担，非因公的病、伤、死亡费用基本上由本人解决，不过多地超过农业社社员的劳保待遇。
