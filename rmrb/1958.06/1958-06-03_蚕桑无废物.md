Silkworm Sericulture Has No Waste
　　Liu Tan

　　People often only know that mulberry planting is for silkworm rearing, and silkworm rearing is for the production of silk. In fact, the role of mulberry planting and silkworm rearing is more than that.

　　Silk is an important raw material for the silk industry, and it can be woven into colorful silk fabrics. It is not only loved by the vast majority of people in our country, but also welcomed by the international market, and can earn a lot of foreign exchange for the country every year. Secondly, silk also has important value in the defense industry: for example, parachutes, hand grenades, and land mine detonating cords all need to use it.

　　Silkworm pupae can be pressed for oil, which is a high-grade lubricant. Every hundred catties of silkworm pupae can yield ten catties of pupae oil, and the remaining oil cake is also a top-quality concentrated feed with considerable nutritional value. Silkworm pupae can also be eaten.

　　Silkworm excrement is a very good fertilizer. Each silkworm seed can produce about two hundred and fifty catties of silkworm excrement, which contains nitrogen fertilizer equivalent to 27.2 catties of ammonium sulfate; phosphorus fertilizer equivalent to 8.3 catties of superphosphate; and potassium fertilizer equivalent to 12.6 catties of potassium sulfate. In addition, silkworm excrement can also be used as medicinal material; if the silkworm excrement is dried, it can also be used to make pillow stuffing.

　　As for mulberry trees, they can not only provide food for silkworms, but also produce other items. If the mulberry leaves are ensiled, they can be used as pig feed.

　　Mulberry dates (mulberries) can be eaten, are juicy and delicious. They can also be used to brew fine wine or make jam. They are also suitable as animal feed.

　　The famous, thin, and strong mulberry bark paper is made from mulberry bark. After scientific processing, mulberry bark can also be made into "artificial cotton."

　　One mu of mature mulberry forest can yield 400 to 800 catties of mulberry branches after summer cutting. Mulberry branches can be used to weave baskets or as fuel.

　　The leftover mulberry residue from silkworm feeding is also useful. Mixing the dried and crushed mulberry residue with silkworm excrement to feed pigs makes it easier for the pigs to gain weight.

　　From this, we can see that planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms is indeed a good thing that achieves multiple goals. We should plant more mulberry trees and vigorously develop the silkworm industry.

　　蚕桑无废物
　　刘锬
    人们往往只知道栽桑是为了养蚕，而养蚕又是为了生产丝绸。其实栽桑和养蚕的作用不仅如此。
    蚕丝是丝绸工业重要的原料，它可以织成色彩鲜艳的绸缎。不仅为我国广大人民所喜爱，而且也受到国际市场的欢迎，每年可为国家换取大量的外汇，其次，丝绸在国防工业上也有其重要价值：如制降落伞、手榴弹及地雷的导火线等都必须用到它。
    蚕蛹可以榨油，是一种高级的润滑剂。每百斤蚕蛹可榨蛹油十斤，榨剩的油饼又是上等的精饲料，营养价值相当高。蚕蛹还可以食用。
    蚕粪是很好的肥料。一张蚕种大约可产蚕粪二百五十斤，其中含氮肥相当于二十七点二斤硫酸铵；含磷肥相当于八点三斤过磷酸钙；含钾肥相当于十二点六斤硫酸钾。除此之外，蚕粪还可以做药材；如果把蚕粪晒干之后，还可以用来做枕头芯子。
    至于桑树，不仅可以供给蚕以食料，同时还可以生产其他的物品。如果把桑叶青贮起来，可以作为猪的饲料。
    桑枣（椹）可以食用，多汁而味美。也可以用来酿成美酒或制成果酱。做动物的饲料也适宜。
    有名的又薄又牢的桑皮纸，就是用桑树皮制成的。桑皮经过科学加工之后，还可以制成“人造棉花”。
    一亩成林桑，夏伐之后可收桑条四百到八百斤。桑条可以编筐篓，也可以做燃料。
    蚕食剩的桑渣，也有用处。把桑渣晒干打碎后和蚕粪拌和起来喂猪，猪就容易上膘。
    从这里可以看出：栽桑、养蚕确实是一举数得的好事。应该多多栽植桑树，大力发展养蚕事业。
