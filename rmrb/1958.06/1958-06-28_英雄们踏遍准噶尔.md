Singing Xinjiang

　　Xinjiang is good, Xinjiang is good, Xinjiang has a priceless treasure. The mighty Junggar, truly has no shortage of gold, silver and treasures. Gold, silver and treasures are not the best, petroleum is the treasure of treasures. Not afraid of the cold, not afraid of the heat, not afraid of the risks of sandy beaches and the Gobi Desert. Heroes traverse the Junggar Basin, heroes are so full of spirit that they can swallow mountains and rivers. We must turn the basin into an ocean of oil, so that oil pipelines are like the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, watching the black petroleum surge forward one wave after another, transported to Beijing, transported to the whole country.

    英雄们踏遍准噶尔新疆好，新疆好，新疆有个无价宝。浩浩荡荡准噶尔，金银财宝真不少。金银财宝不算好，石油才是宝中宝。不怕冷，不怕热，不怕沙滩戈壁风险多。英雄们踏遍准噶尔，英雄们气壮吞山河。要把盆地变油海，叫输油管线像长江像黄河，看黑色的石油后浪追前浪，输送到北京，输送向全国。
             （刘萧无）
