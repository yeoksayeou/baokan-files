Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th. The Satellite Agricultural Cooperative in Suiping County, Henan Province, has achieved an average actual yield of 2,105 jin per mu on five mu of wheat this year. This is 565 jin more than the previous national record of 1,540 jin per mu set by the Shuanghe Agricultural Cooperative in Fang County, Hubei Province, last year. This remarkable achievement was created in the high-yield experimental field cultivated by Comrade Wang Bingyin, deputy secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the cooperative, and members of the Second Production Brigade's Second Team. The cooperative also has a 5.01 mu high-yield field in the Sixth Team of the Second Brigade that yielded over 2,000 jin of wheat per mu.

Recently, under the supervision of local county and township Party and government leaders, three production brigades of the Satellite Agricultural Cooperative harvested 96.79 mu of high-yield wheat, with a total output of 116,310 jin, an average actual yield of 1,201 jin per mu. In addition to the ten mu yielding over 2,000 jin per mu, there were also six mu averaging 1,567 jin per mu, eight mu averaging 1,541 jin and four liang per mu, and the rest were all above 1,000 jin. Zhao Guang, deputy secretary of the Suiping County Party Committee, cultivated a 6.13 mu wheat experimental field with the farmers in this cooperative, with an average yield of 1,204 jin of wheat per mu.

Suiping County used to be a low-yield wheat area in Henan Province, with an average yield of only a little over 100 jin per mu. The high-yield record created by the Satellite Agricultural Cooperative this year has powerfully shattered the erroneous view that wheat production cannot leap forward in low-yield areas. The Suiping County Party Committee is currently holding an on-site wheat production conference in this cooperative to earnestly summarize this experience. The Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Henan Provincial People's Committee have instructed agricultural departments to go to this cooperative to help farmers systematically summarize this experience.

In order to quickly spread the good news of this bumper harvest to the people of the entire province, Henan Daily also issued a special extra edition today. (Attached pictures)

    卫星社坐上了卫星五亩小麦亩产2105斤
    在过去亩产一百多斤的低产区创造了丰产新纪录
    新华社郑州7日电　河南省遂平县卫星农业社今年有五亩小麦每亩平均实产两千一百零五斤，它比去年湖北省房县双河农业社创造的全国小麦亩产最高纪录一千五百四十斤多五百六十五斤。这个奇绩是这个社中共党委副书记王丙寅等同志和第二生产大队二分队社员合作培育的丰产试验田里创造出来的。这个社亩产小麦二千斤以上的还有第二大队六分队的五亩零一厘丰产田。
    最近，卫星农业社有三个生产大队在当地县乡党政领导同志的监督下，单收单打丰产小麦九十六亩七分九厘，总产量达十一万六千三百一十斤，平均每亩实产一千二百零一斤。除了十亩亩产两千斤以外，其中还有六亩平均亩产一千五百六十七斤，八亩平均亩产一千五百四十一斤四两，其余都在一千斤以上。这个县的县委副书记赵光在这个社里和农民一起搞的六亩一分三厘小麦试验田，平均亩产小麦一千二百零四斤。
    遂平县过去是河南省小麦低产地区，一般每亩平均产量只有一百多斤。卫星农业社今年创造的小麦高额丰产纪录，有力地打破了人们认为低产地区的小麦不能大跃进的错误看法。中共遂平县委会目前正在这个社召开小麦生产现场会议，认真总结这一经验。中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会并责成农业部门前往这个社帮助农民系统总结这一经验。
    为了向全省人民迅速地传播这一大丰收的喜讯，河南日报今天还就此专门发出号外。（附图片）
