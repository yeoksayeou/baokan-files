    They are Students and Teachers
    Bali Township Solves Teacher Shortage Problem by Following the Mass Line

    (Our report from) This newspaper's reporter, Sun Chuanhao, reports: Bali Township in Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, has solved the problem of teacher shortage in the great development of universal education by following the mass line. This township adopts the method of "the higher-level teaching the lower-level," with junior high school students serving as teachers for senior primary school classes, and senior primary school students teaching literacy classes. The original number of teachers in Bali Township was less than twenty, and has now increased to more than one hundred and thirty.

    During the Great Leap Forward in Culture, the masses of Bali Township independently established one junior high school class, and developed senior primary school and literacy classes to twenty-eight locations. The number of students enrolled in the township increased sharply from eight hundred to more than one thousand three hundred. However, there were less than twenty teachers in the entire township. After research, they decided to use the junior high school class of Yingchun Agricultural Cooperative as the core, to act as a "teacher training class." The twenty students currently in the junior high school class also concurrently serve as teachers for the civil-run senior primary school classes in each cooperative; the senior primary school classes also selected one hundred relatively outstanding students to serve as teachers in the literacy classes. They are students and teachers.

    The township cultivates teachers in all aspects. Township head Chen Yizhi often goes to the civil-run schools in each cooperative to listen to classes, and jointly studies the curriculum content and improvement measures with the teachers. The township branch of the Chinese Communist Party sends people to give these teachers political classes on a regular basis. When the entire township holds Party and League classes, it also absorbs activist teachers to participate.

    In order to solve the problems of teachers' missed work, the entire township has launched a "respect teachers and love learning" campaign, with each person doing four more workdays per year to solve the problem of teachers' missed work and teaching expenses.

    Because this township has adopted a series of measures, the teachers' political consciousness and teaching proficiency have improved rapidly, and the teaching effect is good.

    他们是学生又是教师
    八里乡走群众路线解决师资问题
    本报讯　记者孙传镐报道：陕西省安康县八里乡走群众路线，解决了普及教育大发展中师资缺乏问题。这个乡采用“高的教低的”的办法，初中班学生当高小班教师，高小班学生教扫盲识字班。八里乡原有教师不到二十人，现已增加到一百三十多人。
    在文化大跃进中，八里乡群众自办初中班一处，高小班和扫盲识字班发展到二十八处，全乡入学人数由八百人激增到一千三百多人。但是全乡教师不到二十人。他们研究后，决定以迎春农业社的初中班为核心，作“师资训练班”。初中班现有二十个学员都兼任各社民办高小班的教师；高小班又抽出一百名比较优秀的学员，担任扫盲班的教员。他们是学生，又是教师。
    乡里对教师从各方面进行培养，乡长陈益志经常到各社民校听课，和教师共同研究课程内容和改进措施；中共乡支部派人定期给这些教师上政治课。全乡上党课和团课时，也吸收教师积极分子参加。
    为了解决教师们的误工等问题，全乡又展开了“尊师爱学”运动，每人每年多做四个劳动日，解决教师的误工和教学经费问题。
    由于这个乡采用了一系列办法，因此教师们的政治觉悟和教学业务水平提高很快，教学效果良好。
