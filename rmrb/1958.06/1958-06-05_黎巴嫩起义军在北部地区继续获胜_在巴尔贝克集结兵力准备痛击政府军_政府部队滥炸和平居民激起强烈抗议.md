According to the Middle East News Agency, insurgent people clashed with government forces on the 3rd in Shtaura, near the Syrian border, and the insurgent people defeated the government forces.

Sources say that a major battle is brewing between the insurgent people and government forces in the Baalbek region of central Lebanon. The government has sent reinforcements to the outskirts of the city. The insurgent people have also deployed a large number of armed forces around Baalbek, preparing to drive the government forces out of the area.

Baalbek, about forty miles northeast of Beirut, is an important city in the Bekaa Valley, known as the breadbasket of Lebanon.

According to Damascus Radio's broadcast on the evening of the 3rd, insurgent forces in the Basta, Mazraa, and Zaitouni districts of Beirut have strengthened their first line of defense, placing flammable materials and landmines to prevent government tanks from approaching these areas.

According to the Middle East News Agency, residents of the New Road district of Beirut decided on the 3rd to complain to the International Committee of the Red Cross about the government's barbaric act of using heavy artillery to bombard this residential area, which caused many casualties. They also decided to file a complaint with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

According to Damascus newspaper reports, as a result of the Lebanese government's indiscriminate bombing of Tripoli on the 3rd, forty-two peaceful residents were killed and three hundred were injured.

The news said that the government forces' barbaric bombing of residents of Tripoli and Beirut by planes and artillery has shocked even many members of parliament who originally supported the government. These members of parliament have decided to intervene. They have decided to collect signatures to demand the resignation of Chamoun.
