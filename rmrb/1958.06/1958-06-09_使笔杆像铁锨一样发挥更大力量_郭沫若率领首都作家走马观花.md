Xinhua News Agency, 8th – With the goal of making pens wield even greater power, just like shovels, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, led the first group of writers and artists from the capital on a "whirlwind tour" to experience life. Over half a month, they visited the rapidly progressing agricultural construction, local factories and mines, and reservoir projects on the grasslands of Zhangjiakou Prefecture in Hebei Province. They also paid respects to various advanced individuals. This team was jointly organized by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association. The writers and artists participating in this "whirlwind tour" included Guo Moruo, Ye Shengtao, Xiao San, Wu Zuoren, Ye Qianyu, Jin Ren, Shen Congwen, Jiang Zhaohe, Shao Yu, Zheng Jingkang, and twenty-three others, the majority of whom are older writers in their fifties or sixties.

The enormous changes in the countryside during the Great Leap Forward and the overwhelming revolutionary drive of the workers and peasants deeply inspired and encouraged the writers and artists, igniting creative enthusiasm in everyone. They composed over a hundred poems along the way, and the five painters created over four hundred works and sketches. When they saw newly opened rice paddies, lush orchards, and scenes of fishing and canal construction resembling the scenery of southern China in Huai’lai County's Garden Township, they eagerly began composing poems and painting. Guo Moruo wrote six or seven poems, including "Ode to Garden Township," praising the socialist construction there. After touring the Guanting Reservoir by boat from Garden Township, he excitedly wrote the following verses: "Northern output surpasses the South, the scenery here exceeds the Great Wall, the fish in Guanting Reservoir are three feet long, the lake and mountains are green on both banks." He also personally wrote wall posters in Garden Township. In Zhuolu County, seeing thousands of people constructing the eighty-li "Pishan Great Canal" with overwhelming force, forcing the Sanggan River to leap over 85 meters high, everyone was deeply moved. Guo Moruo and Ye Shengtao each wrote four poems. One of Guo Moruo's poems reads: "Splitting open Yellow Goat Mountain, raising the Sanggan River, throwing mountains down the riverbank, leading water up the hillside. Turning mountains and overturning seas is commonplace, today's Foolish Old Man is everywhere." One of Ye Shengtao's poems reads: "Come to see the Pishan Canal, its merit surpasses Yu the Great, following the Communist Party, people control nature."

In Zhuolu County's rural areas, the painters discovered many cartoons with socialist romanticism on the walls, including one depicting a large ear of corn being transported by six train cars, twisting the Dragon King's head to make it spit out water. This gave the painters great inspiration. They not only sketched many excellent works to take back for study and research, but also collectively created a large mural, "Calling Mountains to Offer Treasures, Calling Water to Obey Orders," as a gift to the people of Zhuolu.

During the tour, the writers and artists were greatly educated by witnessing the masses' selfless collectivist spirit, their hard work and diligent study, and the close relationship between local cadres and the masses. At the "Pishan Great Canal" construction site in Zhuolu County, Guo Moruo sincerely bowed to the peasants building the canal and said: "We who wield pens have very little power. We must learn from your drive and make our pens wield even greater power, just like your shovels." Ye Shengtao said excitedly at the farewell meeting in Zhuolu: "What we see here can be called workers and peasants splitting mountains together. We humans are also a mountain, and we must also split the mountain and open our hearts. This heart is still a kind of impure mineral, which needs to be smelted in a blast furnace to become a socialist heart that is fast, good, economical, and striving for the top." During the visit, Guo Moruo was moved by seeing the responsible comrades of some local Party organizations mingle with the masses without any distance and said: "The relationship between people here is truly unimaginable in the old society. The local Party committee comrades' frankness, hundredfold kindness, and integration with the masses is something we cannot achieve in a day or two and is worth learning from to transform ourselves." Ye Shengtao also said: "If we can learn one-tenth of the local cadres' style, it will be very good." Shen Congwen and others also expressed that what they had learned this time was more practical than what they had learned in many years in the past.

Through this tour, the writers and artists truly realized the truth that "life is the source of creation."

At the time of their departure from Zhangjiakou, Guo Moruo, on behalf of the visiting writers and artists, spoke freely about the feelings of this "whirlwind tour," saying: Although this was only a quick glance, they had seen many good flowers and many new things that they had never seen or heard before. It can be said that there were fragrant flowers everywhere, and these moving scenes could not be imagined while living in Beijing. He hoped that in the future there would be opportunities to "dismount and watch the flowers" and go deep into life to plant and bloom flowers.

During this visit, the writers and artists also had extensive contact and exchanges with local literature, drama, art, and folk art workers.

The writers returned to Beijing on the 7th.

　　使笔杆像铁锨一样发挥更大力量
    郭沫若率领首都作家走马观花
    新华社8日讯　首都第一批“走马观花”体验生活的作家、艺术家，在中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若率领下，以半个月的时间参观访问了河北省张家口专区正在一日千里向前跃进的农业建设、地方厂矿和草原上的水库工程，拜访了各种先进人物。这支队伍是由中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会共同组织的。参加这次“走马观花”的文学家、艺术家有郭沫若、叶圣陶、萧三、吴作人、叶浅予、金人、沈从文、蒋兆和、邵宇、郑景康等二十三人，其中大多数都是五六十岁以上的老年作家。
    大跃进中农村面貌的巨大变化和工农群众排山倒海的革命干劲，使作家、艺术家们受到强烈的感染和鼓舞，激发着每个人的创作热情，仅一路创作的诗歌即有一百多首，五位画家的作品和素材达四百多幅。当他们在怀来县花园乡看到新开的稻田、繁茂的果园和捕鱼修渠等一片江南景色，兴奋得纷纷兴诗作画。郭沫若写了“花园乡颂”等六、七首诗，歌颂这里的社会主义建设。从花园乡泛舟参观官厅水库之后他又激动地写下了“北方产量过长江南，方景物过长城，官厅水库鱼三尺，夹库湖山两岸青”的诗句，还亲笔在花园乡写了墙头诗。在涿鹿县看到数千群众以排山倒海之势修筑八十华里长的“劈山大渠”、迫使桑干河水跃上八十五公尺高山的壮举，大家都感动万分，郭沫若、叶圣陶各题诗四首，郭沫若题诗之一是：“劈开黄羊山，抬高桑干河，抛山下河岸，引水上山坡。翻山倒海寻常事，今日愚公天下多。”叶圣陶题诗之一是：“来观劈山渠，其功超大禹，跟着共产党，人作自然主。”
    画家们在涿鹿县农村的墙头上发现了许多富有社会主义浪漫主义色彩的漫画，其中有一幅画着一颗用六个车皮运载的大玉米、扭住龙王头要它吐水。给予画家们极大的启发。他们不但描下了许多优秀作品带回去学习研究，并集体创作了“叫山献宝、叫水听命”的大型壁画，献给了涿鹿人民。
    作家、艺术家在参观访问过程中，看到群众忘我的集体主义精神、苦学苦干的劲头及地方干部和群众的亲密关系，受到很大教育。在涿鹿县“劈山大渠”的工地上，郭沫若诚挚地向修建大渠的农民拜老师说：“我们拿笔杆的人力量小得很，我们要好好学习你们的干劲，使笔杆像你们的铁锨一样发挥更大的力量。”叶圣陶曾在涿鹿的告别会上激动地说：“我们在这里看到的可谓工农双劈山，我们人也是一个山，也要劈山交心。这个心还是一种不大纯的矿产，再放到高炉里去熔炼一下，才会变成为社会主义多快好省力争上游的一颗心。”在访问过程中看到一些中共地方党组织负责同志与群众打成一片毫无隔阂的作风，郭沫若曾感动地说：“在这里感受到的人与人之间的关系真是旧社会所梦想不到的，地方党委的同志那种推心置腹、亲切百倍与群众打成一片的作风，真不是我们一天两天能够做到的，值得我们很好学习来改造自己。”叶圣陶也说：“地方干部的作风，我们能学到十分之一就算很不错了。”沈从文等也都表示过去许多年学的东西都没有这次学的踏实。
    作家、艺术家们通过这次参观访问，切实地体会到“生活是创作的源泉”这一真理。
    在张家口临别之时，郭沫若代表参观访问的作家、艺术家畅谈这次“走马观花”的感受说：这次虽只是跑马看花，却已看到了许多很好的花，见到许多见所未见、闻所未闻的新事物，简直可以说是遍地香花，这些动人景象住在北京是想像不出的。他希望今后能有机会“下马观花”，深入到生活中来种花和开花。
    作家、艺术家在这次访问过程中，还与当地文学、戏剧、美术、曲艺工作者进行了广泛接触和交谈。
    作家们于7日回到北京。
