    Chao-Shan Plain Early Rice Yields Break Records
    Average Yield Exceeds 500 Jin Per Mu in Eight Counties and Cities

    (Our dispatch) China's famous high-yield rice area, the Chao-Shan Plain in Guangdong Province, has completed the harvesting of over 1.99 million mu of early rice. According to preliminary verified yields, the average yield per mu has reached over 500 jin, setting a historical record for large-area early rice production in China.

    In 1955, Chao-Shan Plain began to see Chao'an, Chenghai, and Chaoyang becoming thousand-jin grain counties. In 1956, the average yield per mu in the five counties (cities) of Jieyang, Puning, Nanao, Shantou, and Chaozhou in this plain also exceeded 1,000 jin. Since then, the Chao-Shan Plain has become a well-known thousand-jin high-yield plain. In the early crop of 1956, Chao'an County set the highest large-area yield record for early rice in this plain with an average yield of 423 jin per mu. This record, which was equivalent to twice the early rice yield of the county before liberation, had not been broken for several years. Therefore, some people began to think that the already high rice yield in the Chao-Shan Plain could no longer be greatly increased. In the future, it would be remarkable if the record could be maintained or slightly exceeded. However, the facts of this year's early crop have powerfully shattered this "wait-and-see" argument. Now, among the eight counties (cities) in the entire plain, six counties have increased the average yield of early rice by more than 100 jin per mu. Among them, Chao'an County, which originally had a higher yield, increased the average yield per mu by more than 130 jin compared to last year's early crop, reaching 557 jin. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives have achieved thousand-jin mu.

### 潮汕平原早稻产量刷新纪录  八个县市平均亩产五百斤以上

    潮汕平原早稻产量刷新纪录
    八个县市平均亩产五百斤以上
    本报讯　我国著名的水稻高产区——广东省潮汕平原的一百九十九万多亩早稻，已经收割完毕，根据已经初步核实的产量计算，平均每亩产量达到五百斤以上，创造了我国早造水稻大面积的历史最高产量纪录。
    潮汕平原在1955年开始出现潮安、澄海、潮阳三个粮食千斤县，1956年，这个平原的揭阳、普宁、南澳、汕头、潮州五个县（市）的粮食平均每亩产量也突破了一千斤。至此潮汕平原成了远近闻名的千斤丰产平原。1956年的早造，潮安县就以平均亩产四百二十三斤创造了这个平原的早稻大面积最高产量纪录。这个相当于该县解放前早稻产量的两倍的纪录，几年来一直未被突破。因此有人开始认为：潮汕平原已经很高的水稻产量不可能再大大提高了，今后要是能够保持住这个产量纪录不下降，或者略为突破一点，就是很了不起了。但是今年早造的事实却有力地粉碎了观潮派的这个论调。现在，整个平原的八个县（市）中，就有六个县的早稻平均每亩增产一百斤以上。其中原来产量较高的潮安县，平均每亩产量比去年早造增产一百三十多斤，即达到五百五十七斤。此外，还有许多农业社出现了千斤亩。
