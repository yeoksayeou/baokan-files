Today's heroes surpass all generations
　　The Great Wall of ten thousand li is built by the people,
　　The Grand Canal of a thousand li is opened up by the people.
　　Since ancient times, China has had many heroes,
　　Today's heroes surpass all generations.
　　With a wave of the hand, mountains upon mountains are pushed over,
　　With a stroke of the hand, the vast ocean is filled in.
　　　　　　　　(Shandong Folk Song)

    今朝英雄胜百代
    万里长城人民建，
    千里运河人民开。
    自古中国英雄多，
    今朝英雄胜百代。
    举手推倒重重山，
    落手填平茫茫海。
              （山东民歌）
