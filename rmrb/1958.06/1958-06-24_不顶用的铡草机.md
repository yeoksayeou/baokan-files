    Useless Chaff Cutter
    Our station purchased more than thirty chaff cutters from the Chaoyang County Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant in Liaoning Province and distributed them to various agricultural cooperatives. We discovered that not a single one of these chaff cutters was useful; they couldn't even chop cogon grass. The agricultural cooperatives returned the chaff cutters one after another. To resolve this issue, we have repeatedly written to the factory, requesting repairs or replacements, but they have consistently shirked responsibility. The relevant authorities should investigate and address this irresponsible attitude towards product quality on the part of the Chaoyang County Farm Implement Manufacturing Plant.

    不顶用的铡草机
    我站由辽宁省地方国营朝阳县农具制造厂买来三十多台铡草机，给各个农业社使用，发现这批铡草机中没有一台顶用，连茅草都铡不断。各农业社纷纷退回铡草机。为了解决这个问题，我们曾多次给这个厂去信，要求修理或换货，但是他们一味推辞。对朝阳县农具制造厂这种对产品质量不负责的态度，有关方面应检查处理。
