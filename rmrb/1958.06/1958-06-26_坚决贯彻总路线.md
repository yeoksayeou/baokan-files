    Resolutely Implement the General Line
    ·Mishan Farm·
  Put political work in command,
  Red flags planted all over Mishan,
  Engage in technical revolution in a big way,
  Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act.
  Work hard for forty days,
  Ten thousand people and a thousand horses mobilized,
  Two ten thousand hectares of wasteland reclaimed,
  Thirty-three thousand self-built houses,
  Hoe three times, weed three times,
  High-yield plots hoed one more time,
  Wheat harvest completed in three days with a blitz,
  Would not be satisfied without winning the advanced unit title.
  Leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again,
  Resolutely implement the General Line.

    坚决贯彻总路线
    ·密山农场·
  政治工作挂帅，
  红旗插遍密山，
  大搞技术革命，
  敢想、敢说、敢干。
  大干特干四十天，
  万人千马齐动员，
  开荒完成两万垧，
  自建房屋三万三，
  锄三遍来趟三遍，
  高产地号加一遍，
  麦收三天突击完，
  不获先进单位心不甘。
  跃进跃进再跃进，
  坚决贯彻总路线。
