Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, reports: According to Hong Kong newspapers, New Overseas Chinese Middle School in Hong Kong has protested against the unreasonable restrictions imposed by the British Hong Kong Education Authorities, which prohibited the school from hanging the national flag during the school's anniversary celebrations. The school pointed out that this is an unfriendly act by the British Hong Kong Authorities towards the Chinese people.

New Overseas Chinese Middle School originally planned to hold anniversary celebrations on May 10th. More than ten days before the anniversary, the school authorities submitted the proposed program of the celebration ceremony to the Education Department of Hong Kong in accordance with the regulations of the Hong Kong Education Department. In its reply on May 5th, the Hong Kong Education Department permitted the school to have a holiday on the anniversary day, but actually required the school to abide by conditions such as not hanging the national flag, not singing the national anthem, and not paying tribute to the head of state. Deng Naizheng, the principal of New Overseas Chinese Middle School, went to the Education Department to argue with reason, but the Hong Kong Education Department refused to withdraw these conditions.

Due to the unreasonable restrictions of the British Hong Kong Education Authorities, New Overseas Chinese Middle School has decided to postpone the anniversary celebrations in protest. Newspaper reports say that the entire faculty, staff, and students of the school have unanimously expressed indignation at this act by the British Hong Kong Education Authorities that infringes upon the patriotic rights of the Chinese people. They pointed out that hanging the Chinese national flag, singing the national anthem, and paying tribute to the head of state are rights that Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong absolutely cannot be deprived of. The Hong Kong Education Authorities have no reason to impose unreasonable conditions on schools that deprive the Chinese people of their due rights. They said that the Chinese people, including Chinese schools in Hong Kong, have been hanging the national flag in Hong Kong not just from today, but have always done so. The British Hong Kong Education Authorities' sudden adoption of unreasonable measures such as prohibiting schools from hanging the national flag is completely incompatible with the fact that Britain recognizes the People's Republic of China and is an unfriendly act towards the Chinese people. The result of this approach will not bring any benefits to Sino-British relations, nor will it be conducive to education in Hong Kong.

    香港当局侵犯中国人民爱国权利
    无理限制新侨等校悬挂国旗
    学校全体师生职工对香港当局的做法一致表示愤慨
    新华社香港电　据香港报纸报道，香港新侨中学对香港英国教育当局禁止这个学校在校庆典礼上悬挂国旗等无理限制提出了抗议。学校方面指出，这是香港英国当局对中国人民不友好的行为。
    新侨中学原定在5月10日举行校庆纪念活动，在校庆前十多天，学校当局按照香港教育司的规定，将拟定的庆祝仪式程序函报教育司。香港教育司在5月5日的答复中准许这个学校在校庆日放假，但竟然要校方遵守不得悬挂国旗、不得唱国歌和不得向国家元首致敬等条件。新侨中学校长邓乃正为此曾前往教育司据理力争，但香港教育司拒绝取销这些条件。
    由于香港英国教育当局的无理限制，新侨中学已经决定将校庆纪念活动延期举行，以示抗议。报纸消息说，这所学校的全体师生职工对香港英国教育当局这种侵犯中国人民爱国权利的做法一致表示愤慨。他们指出，悬挂中国国旗、唱国歌和向国家元首致敬是香港中国同胞绝对不容剥夺的权利，香港教育当局没有任何理由向学校提出剥夺中国人民应有权利的无理条件。他们说，中国人民包括香港的中国学校，在香港悬挂国旗，不自今天开始，而是向来都是这样的。香港英国教育当局现在突然采取禁止学校悬挂国旗等无理措施，是同英国承认中华人民共和国这一事实完全不相称的，是对中国人民不友好的行为，这种做法的结果，绝不会给中英关系带来什么好处，也绝不利于香港教育事业。
