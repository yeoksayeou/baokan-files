    Large Iron Ore Deposit Discovered in Jiangxi
    Reserves estimated at approximately 7 billion tons; sufficient to support a steel plant producing 30 million tons of steel annually for 50 to 60 years.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 22nd: A vast iron ore deposit has been discovered in the central region of Jiangxi Province. Preliminary surveys and explorations confirm that this Anshan-style sedimentary metamorphic iron ore deposit, spanning over 400 square kilometers across five counties including Xinyu, has reserves estimated at approximately 7 billion tons. If a steel plant with an annual output of 30 million tons of steel were built here, it could operate for 50 to 60 years.
    Currently, over 1,000 exploration personnel are conducting detailed surveys in the mining area, with plans to submit a report on 300 million tons of inferred reserves this year. The Wuhan Metallurgical Design Institute for Ferrous Metals and the Railway Design Institute have recently dispatched personnel to the mining area to gather design data, explore mine sites, and prepare the roadbed for railway construction.
    The chief engineer of the Jiangxi Provincial Geological Bureau told Xinhua reporters that Jiangxi was previously considered a region lacking in iron, but now a large iron ore deposit has been found in the pre-Sinian metamorphic rock series. Pre-Sinian metamorphic rock series are also distributed in central and northeastern Jiangxi, suggesting the possibility of discovering new iron ore deposits in Jiangxi in the future.

    江西发现大铁矿
    储量约70亿吨，如果在这里建设一个年产钢三千万吨的钢铁厂，可以生产50到60年
    新华社南昌22日电  江西省中部地区发现一个巨大的铁矿。经过普查和初步勘探证实：这个跨越新余等五县、面积达四百多平方公里的鞍山式沉积变质铁矿，储量约计有七十亿吨。如果在这里建起一个年产三千万吨的钢铁厂，可以生产五十到六十年。
    现在，这个矿区有一千多名勘探人员正在进行详细勘探，他们计划在今年提出三亿吨的中间性储量报告。武汉黑色冶金设计院、铁道设计院最近都已派人前来矿区收集设计资料、勘探矿址和准备兴修铁道的路基。
    江西省地质总工程师向新华社记者说，江西过去一向被认为是缺铁的地区，但是现在却从前震旦纪变质岩系找到了大铁矿。在赣中、赣东北地区也分布有前震旦纪变质岩系，因此今后江西还可能发现新的铁矿。
