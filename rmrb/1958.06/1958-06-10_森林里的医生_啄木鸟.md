　　The Forest Doctor - The Woodpecker
　　Wen Qing
　　When you stroll through lush woods, you often hear "tap!" "tap!" "tap!" ... sounds from the trees. That is the woodpecker catching insects to eat. Woodpeckers can rid trees of pests, so people call them "doctors" of the forest.
　　Woodpeckers do not perch on branches like ordinary birds; they always climb on upright tree trunks. To adapt to this special life, their bodies also have special structures. Their tongues are slender and long, and horny, capable of stretching and contracting freely. The front end has arrow-like short hooks, which are used to explore parasites on trees, or larvae that have not yet grown. Its four toes are two forward (the second and third toes) and two backward (the first and fourth toes). The toes have sharp claws, which are used to grab the tree trunk and can rotate upwards from the base of the tree trunk. The woodpecker also has a rigid and elastic tail feather as a support point for climbing.
　　There are often many parasitic insects on trees. They bore into the trees, affecting their development and growth, and in severe cases, they can even bore the tree to death. It is difficult for us to eliminate such insects. However, the woodpecker has the ability to eliminate this pest. It taps and pecks everywhere on the tree with its beak to detect the borers, larvae, and pupae lurking under the bark. Once discovered, it inserts its hooked tongue into the bark and uses its tongue, which can secrete mucus, to bring out the larvae or pupae. Woodpeckers have a special ability to eat insects, and they can truly be called "doctors" of the forest.
　　There are many types of woodpeckers, with more than 200 species worldwide and about 20 species in China. The common ones are mostly green woodpeckers. Its back feathers, wing feathers, and tail feathers are all green, its head is bright red, and its chest and abdomen are grayish-white with stripes. The female bird also has irregular blotches on its head.
　　Woodpeckers are produced in both the north and south of China, especially in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, so they can be seen wherever there are trees. (Attached picture)

　　森林里的医生——啄木鸟
　　文青
    当你漫步在葱郁的树林里的时候，常常会听到树上发出“哆”！“哆”！“哆”！……的声音，那是啄木鸟在捉虫吃。啄木鸟能为树木除虫害，所以人们称它为森林里的“医生”。
    啄木鸟不像一般鸟儿那样蹲在树枝上，它总是攀援在直立的树干上。为了适应这种特殊的生活，它的身体也具有特殊的构造。它的舌头细长，有角质，能伸缩自如，在前端生有箭头似的短钩，用这些钩子来探索树上的寄生虫、或尚未长成的幼虫。它的四个脚趾是两个向前（第二和第三两趾）、两个向后
  （第一和第四两趾），脚趾上生有锐利的爪，用来抓住树干，并能从树干基部回旋而上。啄木鸟还有一副刚硬而有弹性的尾羽作为攀援时的支撑点。
    在树上，常常有不少的寄生昆虫，它们蛀食着树木、影响树木的发育和生长，严重的甚至会把树蛀死。这类昆虫，我们很难把它们消灭掉。但是，啄木鸟却有消灭这种害虫的本领，它在树上用嘴到处敲敲啄啄，侦察潜伏在树皮下面的蠹虫、幼虫和蛹。一旦发现，即把有钩的舌头插入树皮，用能分泌粘液的舌，把幼虫或蛹带出。啄木鸟有着特殊的吃虫本领，真能称得上森林里的“医生”。
    啄木鸟的种类很多，全世界有二百多种，我国约有二十余种。常见的多为绿色啄木鸟。它的背羽、翼羽和尾羽均呈绿色，头部呈鲜红色，胸腹灰白色并带有斑纹。雌鸟头部还有不规则的块状斑点。
    我国南北方均产啄木鸟，广西僮族自治区尤多，所以只要有树木的地方，都可以看到它们。（附图片）
