Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 11th: According to TASS, representatives of several British social organizations advocating peace visited the Soviet Union from May 27th to June 11th at the invitation of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee. They exchanged views with the Soviet Peace Defense Committee on the current international situation and various issues concerning the struggle for peace. The British side participating in the talks included prominent figures from the scientific and cultural circles, representatives from religious groups, and other organizations.

After the talks, both sides issued a joint statement. The statement expressed satisfaction with the Soviet government's decision to unilaterally suspend nuclear testing and expressed the hope that "other countries possessing nuclear weapons will subsequently adopt similar decisions."

Participants in the discussion advocated a complete ban on all types of nuclear weapons. Both sides also expressed their hope that top-level talks would be held in the near future.

Both sides agreed that joint efforts must be made to strive for the cessation of the "Cold War" and war propaganda. When discussing the German question, the participants in the talks believed that "the future of their own country should be resolved by the Germans themselves, and in order to make such a solution possible, the two parts of Germany should be reunified under some form of administration acceptable to both parts of Germany." Both sides also unanimously stated that a broad neutral zone must be established in Europe, which should include as many countries as possible.

When discussing the situation in the Middle East, both sides believed that the governments of the countries concerned should not compete for political, economic, and military advantages, but should do everything possible to promote mutual understanding among the countries of the Middle East.

The statement expressed the hope that representatives of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee would visit Britain and that the talks begun in Moscow and the friendships established would continue.

    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：一些拥护和平的英国社会团体的代表应苏联保卫和平委员会的邀请在5月27日到6月11日访问了苏联。他们就当前的国际局势和争取和平的各种问题同苏联保卫和平委员会交换了意见。英国方面参加会谈的有科学和文化界的著名人士、宗教团体和其他组织的代表。
    会谈后双方发表了联合声明。声明对苏联政府单方面停止核试验的决定表示满意，并且表示希望“其他拥有核武器的国家随后也通过类似的决定”。
    参加讨论的人主张完全禁止各种核武器。双方还表示希望，在最近时期举行最高级会谈。
    双方一致认为，必须共同努力来争取停止“冷战”和战争宣传。在谈到德国问题时，会谈参加者认为，“应当由德国人自己来解决他们本国的前途问题，为了要使这种解决成为可能，德国两部分应当在为德国两部分都可以接受的某种管理形式下重新统一。”双方还一致声明必须在欧洲建立广阔的中立地区，其中应当包括尽可能多的国家。
    在谈到中东局势时，双方认为，有关国家政府不应当争夺政治、经济和军事优势，而应当想一切办法促进中东各国的相互了解。
