Hankou Shenxin Textile Factory Spins 230-count High-Grade Yarn

    (Our Dispatch) The jointly state-private owned Hankou Shenxin Textile Factory, on the 19th, used raw cotton and equipment originally for spinning 32-count yarn to spin 230-count high-grade yarn. This yarn is finer than a hair, has a strength of nine pounds, and is of uniform thickness and excellent quality.
    According to old technical theories, spinning high-grade yarn requires a combing machine; currently, no yarn factories in Wuhan have this equipment. Due to the constraints of this outdated theory, Wuhan previously only spun yarn up to 42 counts. However, inspired by the General Line, workers in Wuhan's cotton textile factories, since the beginning of June, have broken outdated theories with a daring and proactive communist spirit. In early June, engineering technicians at the jointly state-private owned Yuhua Yarn Factory, with the support of the leadership, boldly innovated the process design and successfully trial-spun 60-count and 80-count high-grade yarn from ordinary Hubei raw cotton on ordinary spinning machines, dispelling the aforementioned superstitions. On the 12th, this factory spun 100-count high-grade yarn. Subsequently, Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 spun 120-count yarn on the 15th, and Shenxin Yarn Factory spun 140-count yarn on the 16th, and then leaped to 190 counts. On the 19th, it continued to leap to 230 counts.

It can be used to weave high-grade poplin and stockings, and can save a lot of cotton. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Limen (faxed).

    汉口申新纺织厂纺出230支高级纱
    本报讯  公私合营汉口申新纺织厂19日用纺三十二支纱的原棉和设备纺出了二百三十支的高级纱。这是比头发丝还细的纱，强力达到九磅，条杆均匀，质量相当好。
    按照旧的技术理论纺高级纱必须有精梳机；目前，武汉各纱厂都还没有这种设备。由于这种陈旧理论的束缚，武汉过去最高只纺四十二支的纱。但是武汉各棉纺织厂的职工在总路线的鼓舞下，从6月上旬起，纷纷以敢想敢做的共产主义风格打破了过时的理论。6月上旬，公私合营裕华纱厂工程技术人员在领导方面的支持下，大胆革新工艺设计，首先用普通的湖北原棉、在普通的纺纱机上试纺成功了六十支和八十支的高级纱，破除了上述的迷信；12日，这个厂又纺出了一百支的高级纱。接着，武汉国棉一厂在15日纺出了一百二十支的纱，申新纱厂在16日纺出了一百四十支的纱，随后又跃进到一百九十支。19日又继续跃进到二百三十支。
    上图是武汉申新纱厂细纱车间工人在看一百九十支纱的条杆。一百九十支的细纱比头发还要细，肉眼看来和蚕丝差不多。可用它来纺织高级府绸、丝袜，并能节约大量棉花。 		  新华社记者  杨礼门摄（传真）
