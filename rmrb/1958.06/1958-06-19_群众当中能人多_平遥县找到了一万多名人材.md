	The Masses Have Many Talents
	Pingyao County Finds Over 10,000 Talents
	(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, June 18th, reporter Zhang Chao) Putting politics in command and letting talented people take the lead is a good experience created by Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, in solving the problem of insufficient technical strength in local industries.
	In March of this year, Pingyao County formulated a plan for industrial development: to build 616 factories of various kinds within this year and achieve electrification throughout the county. Completing this construction task required considerable technical strength. At first, Pingyao County asked the Yucheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for people, making countless trips, but only got one person. Later, they mobilized talented people in society, and the technical strength was quickly organized. Now, relying on these people with specialized skills, the county has built and put into production three county-run factories, two power stations, and 108 township-run factories.
	Pingyao County mobilized talented people in society through a combination of vigorous mobilization and individual visits. The county and various townships and agricultural cooperatives universally held discussions to mobilize talented people, discussing whether rural areas should run industries and what to do without technical personnel. During the discussion process, everyone recommended each other, and some talented people automatically signed up. Individual visits were made to scattered talented people, or talented people familiar with them were asked to mobilize them. Now, more than 10,000 talented people throughout the county have participated in the county's industrial construction. These talented people include: demobilized soldiers scattered in rural areas who had served as telephone operators in the army, driven cars, built roads, and repaired bicycles; rural blacksmiths, coppersmiths, small furnace smiths, carpenters, cement workers, and those who had opened small coal kilns; fitters, electricians, etc. who had worked in factories and returned to the countryside.
	The Pingyao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the various townships and agricultural cooperatives paid special attention to conducting political and ideological education for talented people. After the talented people were gathered together, they organized debates on the question of who they were working for. In order to ensure that the talented people participating in the construction received regular education and assistance, the county party committee held a construction situation report meeting once a month. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres from various townships and agricultural cooperatives, together with representative talented people, advanced figures, etc., formed organizations such as technical committees as permanent institutions for uniting and educating talented people. Pingyao County's water conservancy project was affected because oxygen welding could not keep up. After joint research by bicycle repairers Ma Yi, Li Shouzhi, Li Chunhe, Gao Zhenming, etc., they raised funds to buy an electric welding machine to help with welding everywhere, ensuring the progress of the county's water conservancy construction.
	Leaders at all levels in Pingyao County also adopted methods such as sending people to large factories and mines to learn, organizing visits, and holding advanced experience promotion meetings to help talented people improve their skills. The electrical talents originally only knew how to do small odd jobs, but now they have all learned how to erect high-voltage line projects. Many people have also learned multiple technologies.
	Leaders at all levels frequently put forward technical topics, pointed out research directions, and inspired the talented people to research and provide technical guidance. Because the talented people had a clear direction for research, even if their technical abilities were not high, they could all find ways to complete various tasks. Junzhai Village in this county wanted to build a coal mine with an annual output of 100,000 tons. The talented people quickly came up with a solution: without geological drilling or surveying tools, twenty native coal masters directed mining based on past experience in digging small kilns; without tunneling tools, two demobilized soldiers who had driven cars created a method of using air compressors to drive wind drills for tunneling. Now, 200 meters of tunnels have been excavated in this coal mine, and coal will be produced soon.
	The various talented people participating in industrial development do not separate themselves from agricultural production. They are both farmers and workers. During the busy farming season, they work with the farmers; during the slack season, they work with the farmers to run industries. This is very beneficial for developing local industry diligently and thriftily.
	Pingyao County has decided to regard the method of concentrating talented people to run industries as the main way to solve the technical strength for developing local industry. In order to adapt to the needs of local industry, the county recently opened a self-funded technical school, enrolling more than 100 high school and junior high school students to train new types of talented people.

### 群众当中能人多  平遥县找到了一万多名人材

    群众当中能人多
    平遥县找到了一万多名人材
    本报太原18日电　记者张超报道：政治挂帅、能人冲锋，这是山西省平遥县在解决地方工业技术力量不足时创造的一条好经验。
    今年3月，平遥县制定了发展工业规划：要在今年内建设各种工厂六百一十六个，实现全县电气化。完成这个建设任务需要相当的技术力量。开始，平遥县向中共榆次地委和中共山西省委要人，跑了无数趟，只要了一个人。后来，他们发动社会能人，技术力量很快组织起来。现在，这个县依靠这些一技之长的人，已经把三个县营厂两个发电站和一百零八个乡营工厂建成并投入生产。
    平遥县动员社会能人是采取大张旗鼓的发动和个别访问相结合的办法进行的。县和各乡、农业社为了发动能人，普遍召开了讨论会，讨论农村要不要办工业？没有技术人员怎么办等问题。在讨论过程中，大家就相互推荐，有的能人自动报了名；对分散的能人进行了个别访问，或请和他们熟悉的能人去动员。现在，全县已有一万多名能人参加了县的工业建设。这些能人们包括：分散在农村曾经在军队当过电话员的、开过汽车的、筑过路的、修过自行车的转业军人；农村中的铁匠、铜匠、小炉匠、木匠、水泥匠和开过小煤窑的；曾经在工厂作过工又回到农村的钳工、电工等。
    中共平遥县委和各乡、农业社特别注意对能人们进行政治思想教育，他们在能人集中起来以后，就组织辩论为谁劳动的问题。为了使参加建设的能人们经常得到教育和帮助，县委每月召开一次建设形势报告会。各乡和农业社的党、政、工、团干部，都同有代表性的能人、先进人物等，组成技术委员会等组织，作为经常团结教育能人的机构。平遥县的水利工程由于氧气焊接跟不上受到了影响，修自行车的马义、李守志、李春和、高振明等经过共同研究后，集资买了一部电焊机到处去帮助焊接，保证了这个县的水利建设进度。
    平遥县各级领导还采取派人到大厂矿学习、组织参观、召开先进经验推广会等办法，帮助能人提高技术。电气能人们原来大都只会干些小零活，现在，都学会了架设高压线工程。还有很多人学会了多种技术。
    各级领导经常提出技术课题，指出研究的方向，启发能人们研究，进行技术领导。能人们由于钻研的方向明确，即使自己的技术能力不高，也都能想办法完成各种课题。这个县的军寨村要建设一座年产十万吨的煤矿。能人们很快就想出了办法：没有地质钻探、测量工具，二十个土煤师就根据过去挖小窑的经验，看山形指挥开采；没有掘进工具，两个开汽车的转业军人就创造了用空气压缩机带动风钻进行掘进。现在，这个煤矿已开凿出二百公尺的巷道，很快就可出煤了。
    参加办工业的各种能人们，并不脱离农业生产。他们既是农民，又是工人，在农忙时，他们和农民一起干农活；农闲时就和农民一起办工业。这对勤俭发展地方工业有很大好处。
    平遥县已决定把集中能人办工业的办法，当作解决发展地方工业技术力量的主要办法。为了适应地方工业的需要，这个县最近开办了一所自费技术学校，吸收了一百多名高中、初中学生，培养新型的能人。
