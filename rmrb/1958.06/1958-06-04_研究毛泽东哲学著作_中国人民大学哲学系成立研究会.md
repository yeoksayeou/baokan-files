Xinhua News Agency, 31st. The "Mao Zedong Philosophical Works Research Society," established by the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China, has recently formulated a work plan for 1958-1960 and its first batch of research topics.

The establishment of the "Mao Zedong Philosophical Works Research Society" is to systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought, to study how Comrade Mao Zedong applied and developed Marxist philosophy in the practice of the Chinese revolution, and to study the experience of the Chinese revolution and construction from a philosophical perspective, so as to improve the school's philosophy teaching and scientific research work, and to correct the deviations of being divorced from reality, valuing the past over the present, and studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation. The first batch of special research plans proposed by the research society includes fifteen aspects. The research focuses include Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on contradictions among the people and his contribution to the theory of uninterrupted revolution, the general line for socialist construction, etc. All these topics will be completed by 1959. In the second half of this year, a "Lecture Series on the Study of Mao Zedong's Philosophical Works" will also be offered in the Department of Philosophy.

At the first meeting of the research society, the establishment of the executive committee was announced, with Hu Xikui, Vice President and Party Secretary, serving as the Director-General. Most of the members have now selected their research topics and are starting to formulate individual research plans.

    研究毛泽东哲学著作
    中国人民大学哲学系成立研究会
    新华社31日讯  中国人民大学哲学系成立的“毛泽东哲学著作研究会”，已在最近制定了1958—1960年的工作计划和第一批研究专题。
    “毛泽东哲学著作研究会”的成立，是为了系统地研究毛泽东同志的哲学思想，研究毛泽东同志怎样在中国革命实际中运用和发展马克思主义哲学；从哲学上研究中国革命和建设的经验，以便在这个基础上改进学校的哲学教学和科学研究工作，纠正脱离实际、厚古薄今和静止地、孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的偏向。这个研究会提出的第一批专题研究计划包括十五个方面。其中研究的重点有：毛泽东同志关于人民内部矛盾的学说和对不断革命论的贡献，社会主义建设总路线等。以上这些专题将在1959年内完成。在今年下半年，还将在哲学系开设“毛泽东哲学著作研究讲座”。
    这个研究会的第一次会议上，宣布成立了干事会，由副校长、党委书记胡锡奎任总干事。现在大部分会员已经选好研究题目，正在着手制定个人研究计划。
