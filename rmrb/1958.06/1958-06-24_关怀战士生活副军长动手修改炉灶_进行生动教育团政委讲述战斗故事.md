Concern for Soldiers' Lives: Deputy Army Commander Personally Modifies Stoves
Political Commissar of the Regiment Provides Vivid Education by Telling Combat Stories
The PLA unit’s guard company has been stationed on a certain island on the coastal defense front for more than twenty days, but the cooks are still not accustomed to using coal to cook rice. In addition, the stoves were poorly built, resulting in rice that was either undercooked or burnt, and the soldiers had not yet had a satisfactory meal.

After hearing about this situation, Deputy Army Commander Dong Mingchun, disregarding the high mountains and long roads, immediately led an inspection team to the guard company to study and resolve the problem. As soon as he arrived at the kitchen, he took off his coat, squatted in front of the stove, and carefully observed the situation under the pot. He found that the bottom of the pot was too close to the grate, the firebox was too small, and the grate was too flat, preventing the coal from igniting after it was added. Even if there was a fire in the front, it couldn't pass to the back, and the area where the coal fire rose was not large enough, so cooking rice was wasteful of coal and time, and the front was raw while the back was burnt. He asked the comrades of the inspection team to remove the pot, and he personally used his hands to remove the coal slag and coal ash from the stove chamber, cut away the bloated areas inside the stove, and appropriately raised the bottom of the pot. In less than two hours, the stove was preliminarily modified. After testing, the stove burned very well, the amount of coal burned was reduced by half compared to the past, the time was also shortened by half, and the cooked rice was fragrant, neither burnt nor raw.

On the training ground, the second comprehensive obstacle course exercise began. Political Commissar of the Regiment Deng Guizong proposed to compete with Chen Mingzheng. Chen Mingzheng was a second lieutenant ordnance assistant, a high school graduate, who became a soldier after the “Double-Anti” campaign. The fact that the political commissar wanted to compete with him caused surprise among the comrades.

The competition began. The first time, the two were neck and neck. But the second time, Chen Mingzheng felt flustered, sweat broke out on his forehead, and his limbs also became weak. At this time, someone suddenly shouted: "Learn from the Political Commissar!" Chen Mingzheng looked up and saw that the political commissar had begun the third exercise. He didn't know where he got the energy, and with a flip, he followed suit.

After the exercise, the soldiers and the political commissar sat together, one asking if the political commissar was tired, and another asking if the political commissar wanted to drink water. The political commissar said with a smile: "Let's not ask these questions first, shall I tell you a combat story?" Then he began to tell it. In 1940, when fighting the Japanese devils, Deng Guizong was a squad leader. In one battle, a new soldier panicked and threw a grenade without pulling the pin. As a result, the enemy threw the grenade back, and he himself was injured. The soldiers all laughed and said: "This new soldier suffered an unjust loss, he can only blame himself." The political commissar said: "Don't laugh at that new soldier, didn't some of us fail to pull the pin when we practiced throwing grenades just now?" One soldier said: "The ones we threw just now were practice grenades, there was no pin!" The political commissar said: "Even if there is no pin, you should seriously make the motion of pulling the pin. If you don't develop this habit in peacetime, you will suffer in wartime."

218 Hospital Director Meng Jiyue took off his major's uniform, put on an isolation gown, and went to the hospital's surgery department as a nurse.

As soon as he entered the ward, he became one with the nursing staff in life. He moved his luggage to the nurses' dormitory, ate in the staff canteen, and swept the floor, fetched water, emptied bedpans, wiped backs, and trimmed nails for seriously ill patients with the nurses, vying to do everything. In just over twenty days, he worked with the surgical medical staff to study and solve thirty-four problems. For example, the sitz bath water prepared for patients with anal problems used to have the medicine put in by the nurses, but the potassium permanganate content was less than one in ten thousand, which could not sterilize. Because the military doctor didn't pay attention, and the head nurse didn't check, the leadership never knew, but he discovered it this time.

Under the influence of Meng Jiyue, an unprecedented new situation appeared in the surgery department. Doctors diagnose during the day, perform surgery, and after meetings and study in the evening, they also have to write medical records and surgical records. Other medical staff also take very good care of patients.

### 关怀战士生活副军长动手修改炉灶  进行生动教育团政委讲述战斗故事

    关怀战士生活副军长动手修改炉灶
    进行生动教育团政委讲述战斗故事
    解放军某部守备连，进入海防前线某岛已经二十多天了，但炊事员同志还不习惯用煤煮饭。加上锅灶造得不好，做的饭不是生就是糊，战士们还没吃过一顿如意饭。
    董鸣春副军长听到这个情况后，不顾山高路远，立即带着检查组到这个守备连去研究解决。他一到伙房，就脱下衣服，蹲在灶门口，仔细观察锅底下的情况。他发现锅底离炉条太近，灶膛太小，炉条太平，添上煤后不起火；即使前面有火，后面的火过不去，煤火上升的面积不大，所以烧饭费煤费时间，前面生后面糊。他叫检查组的同志把锅拿掉，自己用手把灶腔内的炭渣、煤灰掏掉，把灶膛内臃肿的地方砍掉，把锅底适当抬高，不到两小时，就把灶初步改好了。经过试验，锅灶很好烧，烧煤量比过去降低一半，时间也缩短一半，做的饭香喷喷的，不糊又不生。
    教练场上，超越障碍第二综合练习开始了。团政委邓桂宗提出要和陈名正竞赛。陈名正是少尉军械助理员，高中毕业生，双反后才下班当战士的。政委要和他比赛，引起了同志们的惊讶。
    比赛开始了。第一次，两人不相上下。可是到第二次的时候，陈名正心里发慌了，满头冒汗，手脚也松软了下来。这时，忽然有人喊了一声：“向政委学习！”陈名正抬头一看，见政委又开始作第三次练习了。他不知从哪儿来了一股劲，一翻身，便跟了上去。
    练习完毕，战士们和政委坐在一起，这个问政委累不累，那个问政委要不要喝水。政委笑着说：“先别问这些吧，我给你们讲个战斗故事好不好？”接着他就讲起来了。1940年打日本鬼子的时候，邓桂宗当班长。在一次战斗中，一个新战士发了慌，手榴弹没有拉弦就投了出去。结果敌人又把手榴弹扔回来，他自己也受了伤。战士们听了都笑道：“这位新战士吃了冤枉亏，只能怨他自己。”政委说：“大家不要笑话那个新战士，刚才我们练习投弹时，不是也有人不拉弦么？”一个战士说：“我们刚才投的是教练弹，没有弦呀！”政委说：“没有弦，也应该认真地做出拉弦的动作来。平时不养成这个习惯，战时是会吃亏的。”
    218医院院长孟继曰脱下少校军服，穿上隔离衣，到该院外科当护理员了。
    他一下病室，在生活上就和护理人员打成了一片。他把行李卷搬到护士宿舍，在职工食堂吃饭，和护理员一块扫地、打水，给重病员倒便器、擦背、修指甲，事事都争着作。在短短的二十多天中，他就和外科医护人员一起研究解决了三十四项问题。比如为肛门部位患者配的坐浴水，过去由护士放药，过锰酸钾的含量不到万分之一，不能灭菌消毒。由于军医没注意、护士长不检查，领导上一直不知道，这次被他发现了。
    在孟继曰的影响下，外科室出现了前所未有的新局面。医生白天诊断，做手术，晚上开会、学习以后，还要补写病历和手术记录。其他医务人员，对病人的照顾也十分周到。
