Organize Technical Battalions to Attack Technical Fortresses
Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Large Quantities of Precision Instruments

　　This dispatch from our reporter Zhou Jingyu: Under the guiding ideology of "politics in command and technology as guarantee," the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory has planned and purposefully organized several technical battalions to march toward scientific and technological fortresses. It has found a concrete path that is both red and expert for the technical revolution of factory and mining enterprise workers.

　　Optical instruments are a new industry in China. Many existing products internationally are only being trial-produced for the first time in our country. Therefore, many new problems arise with each new product, forcing the vast number of workers and technicians to put in hard work on technology. In order to conquer many technical fortresses and clear the way for the great leap forward in production, the factory leadership, based on the factory's annual plan and current tasks, has established ten technical battalions according to the different properties of products and processes. Each battalion absorbs relevant personnel from technical departments, workshop technicians, and veteran workers. Each battalion has clear task targets and requirements. Some battalions are responsible for the trial production of new products, and others are responsible for the improvement of old products. All products undertaken by the battalions are technically responsible from product design to parts manufacturing to final assembly to inspection and qualification. Otherwise, it cannot be considered a completed task.

　　After the technical battalions were formed, the production outlook quickly changed. In April, the factory successfully trial-produced a total of seven new products with high precision, including an optical extensometer, a Class 3 precision level, a Type 18 biogas detector, a 1500x biological microscope, and three types of optical glass. The optical constants of this glass meet the Soviet national standard Class 1. At the same time, the production tasks of eight products were completed. Under the fierce attack of the technical battalions, many long-standing problems were also solved. For example, how to adapt the performance of optical instruments to the salty steam and hot climate of China's coastal areas to prevent the formation of deposits. This is a problem that has not been solved by international products. To solve this problem, ten solutions were tested over the past six months, but none were successful. This time, the technical battalion and the veteran workers worked together to find the cause of the failure, adopted effective measures, filled in dry air, and sealed it so that the rotating parts would never leak air under atmospheric pressure.

　　The reporter invited the engineering and technical personnel of this factory to hold a small discussion. Those who attended included comrades Lin Yuan, Wei Shushang, Li Shutang, and Zhou Lianshan. When they talked about the technical battalions, they simply saw endless benefits. To sum it up, there are the following points:

　　First, the organization of technical battalions has strengthened the unity and cooperation between engineering and technical personnel and their sense of production responsibility. In the past, technical personnel in departments only managed their own tasks, and few people cared about the problems in the production workshop. If a problem involved several departments, they often shirked responsibility and passed the buck. Now, a battalion has a common goal, and problems can be decided immediately and solved.

　　Second, the members of the technical battalions enriched their technical theory in practical labor and, at the same time, helped the workers improve their technical theory level. A young technician from the process department said that the members of the technical battalion participated in workshop labor and worked with the workers to carry out technical work, which can be regarded as killing three birds with one stone: First, it can cultivate a labor perspective and transform thinking. Second, it can improve relations with workers. Third, it can master practical knowledge and achieve both red and expert.

　　Third, as product tasks change, technical battalions can reorganize technical forces according to new tasks.

　　Now, the technical revolution activities in this factory have almost become everyone's instinct. The reporter visited several workshops and encountered engineering and technical personnel studying product technical problems with workers everywhere. The special columns of innovation platforms, contribution platforms, and leap forward palaces were filled with rationalization proposals and advanced people's deeds. This situation greatly encouraged the bold ideas of the vast number of workers and masses. The bold ideas of the broad masses and the special research of the engineering and technical battalions are combined, and the daily activities of the department personnel and the production activities of the production workshop are combined, producing a new production relationship and twisting into a new force that is invincible.

　　组织技术大队　攻打技术堡垒
    云南光学仪器厂试制成功大量精密仪器
    本报讯　记者周静宇报道：云南光学仪器厂在政治是统帅、技术是保证的指导思想下，有计划有目的地组织若干个技术大队，向科学技术堡垒进军，为厂矿企业职工进行技术革命，找到了一条又红又专的具体道路。
    光学仪器在我国是一种新的工业，国际上许多已有的产品，在我国只是初次试制。因此，每项新产品都会出现许多新问题，这种情况，逼使广大职工和技术人员不得不在技术上下苦工夫。为了攻下许多技术堡垒，为生产大跃进扫清道路，厂的领导方面根据工厂年度规划和当前任务，按照产品和工艺性质的不同，分别成立十个技术大队，每个大队吸收有关的技术科室人员、车间技术人员和老工人等参加，每个大队都有明确的任务指标和要求。有的大队担任新产品的试制，有的负责老产品的改进，凡是由大队承担的产品，从产品设计到零件制造到总装配到检验合格，在技术上统由大队负责到底，否则，就不能算完成任务。
    技术大队组成后，生产面貌很快就发生变化。4月份，全厂试制成功精密度很高的新产品共有七种，其中有光学引伸计、三级精度水平仪、18型沼气检定仪、一千五百倍生物显微镜，还有三种光学玻璃，这种玻璃的光学常数符合苏联国家标准第一类。同时，还完成了八种产品的生产任务。在技术大队的猛攻下，许多长期没有解决的问题也解决了。例如在光学仪器的使用性能上如何适应我国沿海盐蒸气和炎热的气候，不致产生附着物。这是国际产品上没有解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，半年来曾试验了十个方案，结果都没有成功；这次，技术大队和老工人一起找出了失败的原因，采取了有效办法，装进了干燥空气，加以密封，在大气压下转动部位永不漏气。
    记者邀请了这个厂的工程技术人员举行了一次小型座谈会，到会的有林渊、魏述尚、李树棠、周连山等同志，他们谈起技术大队，简直是好处无边；概括起来有如下几点：
    第一、技术大队的组织加强了工程技术人员之间的团结协作和生产责任感。过去，科室技术人员只管分内的任务，生产车间的问题很少有人过问，如果一个问题牵连到几个科室，常常互相推诿，踢来踢去，现在，一个大队有着一个共同的目标，遇有问题，立刻可以作出决定，求得解决。
    第二、技术大队的成员在实际劳动中丰富了自己的技术理论，同时，又帮助工人提高技术理论水平，工艺科有个青年技术员说，技术大队的成员参加车间劳动，同工人一齐去作技术工作，可算一举三得：一可以培养劳动观点，改造思想，二可以和工人搞好关系，三可以掌握实际知识，达到又红又专。
    第三、随着产品任务的改变，技术大队可以根据新的任务重新组织技术力量。
    现在这个厂的技术革命活动几乎成为每个人的本能活动，记者参观了几个车间，到处碰到工程技术人员同工人一起研究产品技术问题，革新台、献功台、跃进宫的专栏里，布满了合理化建议和先进人物事迹，这个情况大大鼓舞了广大职工群众的大胆设想。广大群众的大胆设想和工程技术大队的专题研究结合在一起，科室人员的日常活动和生产车间的生产活动结合在一起，产生了一种新的生产关系，扭成了一股新的力量，所向无敌。
