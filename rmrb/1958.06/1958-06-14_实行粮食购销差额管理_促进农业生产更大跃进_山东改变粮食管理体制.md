Implementing Grain Purchase and Sales Differential Management to Promote a Greater Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
Shandong Changes Grain Management System

(Our dispatch) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee recently issued a decision on changing the grain management system.

The decision stated that in order to further promote the great leap forward in agricultural production, to facilitate the further stabilization of the national grain purchase and sales situation, and to simplify the cumbersome procedures of annually verifying output and tasks, in accordance with the spirit of the recent National Grain Conference, it was decided to change the grain management system to a differential purchase and sales management method starting this year. Once the purchase and sales differential (surplus or deficit) for the province, special districts, and counties (cities) is determined, it will not be changed for five years. The differential stipulated by the province will be the responsibility of each special district and county (city) under contract. According to this method, the total grain procurement task for the province is set at 6 billion jin. This number is contracted to the communes in one go and will remain unchanged for five years, with no increase in procurement for increased production.

The decision, taking into account the severe disaster situation in Shandong Province in 1957 and the relatively weak foundation of the farmers, and considering the need to develop livestock and pigs on a large scale in the future, and to appropriately improve the consumption level of the farmers, also determined that in 1958 and 1959, the annual grain procurement task could be completed at 5.6 billion jin. In the following three years, from 1960 to 1962, with the greater leap forward in production, 6 billion jin must be completed annually to increase reserves and compensate for poor harvests with good ones.

Regarding the unified sale of grain in rural areas, it should be determined annually in the future. However, the decision pointed out that with the continuous development of production, the amount of grain sold in rural areas should be reduced year by year. Except for areas with disasters or areas with a particularly high concentration of cash crops, most areas should achieve "purchase only, no sale" within two to three years.

At the same time as the release of this decision, the Dazhong Daily of Shandong published an editorial entitled "Make the Policy of Fixed Grain Procurement for Five Years Known to Every Household." The editorial fundamentally clarified the timeliness and great significance of this decision based on the principle that the superstructure must adapt to and promote the development of the economic base. It also pointed out that the implementation of this decision can not only increase the country's grain reserves, but also increase the grain accumulation of agricultural cooperatives and their members. Because with the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, grain output will increase year by year, while the national procurement task is fixed once for five years, with no increase in procurement for increased production. In this way, the grain produced by agricultural cooperatives can be used partly as the public accumulation and reserves of the cooperative, and partly can be distributed to the members as reserves, gradually achieving a situation where the state has surplus grain, every cooperative has surplus grain, and every household has surplus grain. This is beneficial to the country, the cooperatives, and the members.

### 实行粮食购销差额管理　促进农业生产更大跃进  山东改变粮食管理体制

    实行粮食购销差额管理　促进农业生产更大跃进
    山东改变粮食管理体制
    本报讯  中共山东省委、山东省人民委员会最近发布了关于改变粮食管理体制的决定。
    决定说，为了进一步促进农业生产的大跃进，有利于国家粮食购销状况进一步稳定，并简化每年核定产量和任务的繁杂手续，根据最近举行的全国粮食会议的精神，决定从今年开始将粮食管理体制改变为购销差额的管理办法。省、专区、县（市）三级的购销差额（余额或缺额）确定后，五年内不再变动。省规定的差额由各专区、县（市）包干负责。根据这个办法，确定全省征购任务为六十亿斤。这个数字一次包到社，五年不变，增产不增购。
    决定考虑到山东省1957年灾情严重，农民底子较空；照顾到今后大量发展牲畜、毛猪的需要，和适当提高农民的消费水平，又确定1958年和1959年两年，每年可完成征购任务五十六亿斤。而后三年，即1960年至1962年，随着生产的更大跃进，每年则要完成六十亿斤，以增加储备，以丰补歉。
    关于农村粮食统销问题，今后要一年一定。但是决定指出，随着生产的不断发展，农村粮食统销量应当逐年减少，除遇有灾荒或经济作物特别集中的地区以外，一般地区应在两三年内做到只购不销。
    在这一决定发布的同时，山东大众日报特以“让粮食包购五年不变的政策家喻户晓”为题发表了社论。社论以上层建筑必须适应并促进经济基础的发展的原理，从根本上阐明了这一决定的适时和它的重大意义。并且指出，这一决定的实行，不仅可以增加国家的粮食储备，同时可以增加农业社、社员的粮食积累。因为随着农业生产的不断跃进，粮食产量年年增加，而国家征购任务则是一次定住五年不变，增产不增购。这样，农业社增产的粮食，一部分作为社里的公共积累和储备，一部分可以分给社员作储备，逐步做到国家有余粮、社社有余粮、户户有余粮。这对国家、合作社、社员都有好处。
