Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 27th: After the Enlarged Meeting of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which focused on opposing local nationalism, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Autonomous Region have held gatherings, discussions, and written letters to the Xinjiang Daily, expressing extreme anger at the reactionary words and deeds of local nationalists who attempt to split the unity of the motherland, undermine national unity, and oppose the leadership of the Party and socialist construction. They unanimously support the resolution of the Enlarged Meeting of the Autonomous Region Committee and are determined to fight local nationalists to the end.

    In Urumqi, local ethnic minority cadres, workers, and teachers in various organizations, groups, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools, during discussions, unanimously agreed that local nationalists are scum among ethnic minorities and enemies of all ethnic groups. Only by exposing and removing them from the ranks of the people can socialist construction be carried out smoothly in the Autonomous Region. Many people also cited facts to refute the reactionary remarks of local nationalists. Tuhuti Shanaer (Uygur), vice chairman of the trade union of the October Automobile Repair Factory, said: In our factory, in just a few years, from not having a single ethnic minority worker, we have trained more than 600 workers of Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, and Xibe nationalities. Some of these have even been promoted to be responsible cadres in the factory and workshops. This fully demonstrates that without the leadership of the Party and the help of Han workers, our ethnic minorities could not have achieved such great development in political, economic, and cultural undertakings today. Re Wufu, a cadre of the Autonomous Region Education Department, listed the fact that the number of middle school students in the Autonomous Region has developed from more than 5,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 60,000 at present, and from not having a single regular institution of higher learning to having five institutions of higher learning now, to refute the nonsense of local nationalists. He said: If it were not for the leadership of the Party and the help of the Han people, the education cause of the Autonomous Region could never have achieved such great results. Hejia Niyazi Aji (Uygur), vice chairman of the Islamic Association of the Autonomous Region, said: The relationship between ethnic minorities and the Han people and the motherland is like branches to a tree, and can never be separated. Xinjiang has always been, and will always be, an inseparable part of the motherland.

    People of all ethnic groups in various parts of the Autonomous Region have also held meetings one after another to denounce the crimes of local nationalists. Saimaiti Asimu, an ethnic minority responsible cadre of the Aksu Prefecture, said: We often receive letters from farmers praising the Production and Construction Corps for supporting local agricultural production. The relationship between the Production and Construction Corps and local farmers is like blood and flesh. We must never tolerate the slander of the Production and Construction Corps by local nationalists. Two hundred and sixteen representatives from religious circles in Hotan County unanimously believed that local nationalists are just a handful of bats, and can never block the immense light of socialism. They expressed that they will always follow the Communist Party.

    维护祖国的统一和民族的团结
    新疆各族人民声讨地方民族主义分子
    据新华社乌鲁木齐27日电　以反对地方民族主义为中心内容的中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会扩大会议闭幕以后，自治区各地的各族各界人民纷纷集会座谈和写信给新疆日报，对地方民族主义分子企图分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结，反对党的领导和社会主义建设等反动言行表示极大愤怒，一致拥护自治区党委扩大会议的决议，决心同地方民族主义分子斗争到底。
    在乌鲁木齐市，各机关、团体、厂矿企业和学校中的本地民族干部、职工和师生在座谈时，一致认为地方民族主义分子是少数民族中的败类，是各族人民的公敌，只有把他们从人民的队伍中揭露出来，清除出去，才能在自治区顺利地进行社会主义建设。许多人并列举事实驳斥了地方民族主义分子的反动言行。十月汽车修配厂工会副主席托乎地沙那尔（维吾尔族）说：我们厂在短短的几年中，从没有一个少数民族工人到今天已培养出维吾尔、哈萨克、回、锡伯等民族工人六百多人，其中有些人还被提拔成为厂和车间的负责干部，这充分说明没有党的领导和汉族工人的帮助，我们少数民族在政治、经济和文化事业上就不可能有今天这样巨大的发展。自治区教育厅干部热吾甫列举了自治区的中学生由解放初期的五千多名发展到目前的六万多名，由没有一所正规的高等学校发展到现在有五所高等学校的事实，来驳斥地方民族主义分子的谰言。他说：要不是党的领导和汉族人民的帮助，自治区的教育事业决不可能取得这样大的成绩。自治区伊斯兰教协会副主任禾加尼亚孜阿吉（维吾尔族）说：少数民族同汉族人民和祖国的关系，像树枝同大树一样永远不能离开，新疆历来就是、今后也永远是祖国不可分割的一部分。
    自治区各地的各族人民也都先后集会声讨地方民族主义分子的罪行。阿克苏专署民族负责干部赛买提阿西木说：我们经常收到农民表扬生产建设兵团支援地方农业生产的来信，生产建设兵团和当地农民的关系就像血和肉一样，我们决不能容忍地方民族主义分子对生产建设兵团的污蔑。和阗县宗教界二百一十六名代表一致认为地方民族主义分子不过是一小撮蝙蝠，永远遮不住社会主义的万丈光芒。他们表示要永远跟着共产党。
