Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: The Yangtze and Huaihe River basins have entered the flood season, and various regions are actively organizing flood prevention work. The Central Flood Control Headquarters officially began operations in mid-May.

	The flood season on the Yangtze River has arrived early this year, and Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and other places have already engaged in flood prevention efforts. What is different this year from previous years is that not only do the points and lines of embankments along the rivers and lakes need flood prevention, but also the large number of ponds, dams, reservoirs, canals and other water conservancy projects built in various places last winter and this spring have not been tested by floods, so flood prevention must be carried out comprehensively. In order to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest and avoid possible disasters, we must strengthen all flood prevention preparations before the flood season and promptly and vigorously strengthen flood prevention leadership.

	Since May, provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, and Jiangsu have successively held flood prevention meetings and started to establish flood prevention organizations. Most counties in Henan Province have established flood prevention headquarters, and some townships and communes have also established flood prevention organizations, and are actively preparing flood prevention materials and training flood prevention technicians. Hebei Province requires agricultural cooperatives to establish rain gauge stations, townships to establish observation stations, and riverside areas to establish water level and hydrological stations, so that every cooperative has a point and every township has a station. People have now been sent to various places to assist in the construction of stations.

	This year, the flood prevention work on the Yellow River is being carried out tightly and started early. From mid-April to early May, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and relevant local departments organized inspection teams to inspect important embankment sections of the Yellow River in Henan and Shandong. Riverside flood prevention agencies must resume operations in advance and re-inspect riverside dikes. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Huai River Harnessing Commission recently held flood prevention meetings for the Yellow River and Huaihe River basins respectively. The meetings repeatedly emphasized the need to further mobilize and prepare ideologically and organizationally. The Huai River Harnessing Commission specifically reminded provinces along the river to pay attention to the protection of small reservoirs, to seize the ending projects, and for reservoirs that cannot be completed before the flood season, open the spillways first, strengthen inspections, and remedy problems in a timely manner.

	The embankment repair project of the Songhua River has been almost uninterrupted from last autumn to now. In order to learn from past lessons, Heilongjiang Province has prepared a large number of grass bags for flood prevention from last winter to now, so that we are prepared for any eventuality.

	Since the beginning of summer, southern regions have been continuously raining. Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have experienced heavy rainfall, exceeding the rainfall in the same period in previous years. In May, the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers in Hunan Province successively experienced flood peaks. Thanks to the spirit of communist cooperation and concerted efforts, the people of the province have continuously overcome seven major floods. Now, every key section and project has someone responsible for protection. The people along the river in Jiangxi Province have also organized flood prevention and rescue teams to heighten, reinforce and strengthen the defense of the dangerous sections of the embankments, while strengthening the maintenance and management of water conservancy and irrigation projects, and appropriately deepened the spillways to facilitate flood discharge.

	According to meteorological forecasts, there will still be more rain in the Yangtze River basin in June. Hubei and other provinces have held emergency meetings to make arrangements for flood prevention.

    长江和淮河流域进入汛期
    点线面结合全力迎战洪水
    新华社4日讯　长江和淮河流域已经进入汛期，各地都在积极组织防汛工作。中央防汛总指挥部在5月中旬已正式办公。
    今年长江的汛期提早到来，湖南、江西、安徽等地已经投入防汛斗争。今年和往年不同的地方是，不仅江河湖滨堤段的点线要防汛，而且去冬今春各地兴修的大量塘坝、水库、渠道等水利工程大多没有经过洪水考验，都要全面进行防汛。为了保证农业大丰收，避免可能发生的灾害，必须在汛前加强一切防汛准备工作，及时大力加强防汛领导。
    5月以来，河北、河南、山东、湖北、江苏等省都陆续召开了防汛会议，着手建立了防汛机构。河南省大部分县都建立了防汛指挥部，部分乡社也建立防汛机构，并积极准备防汛器材和训练防汛技术人员。河北省要求农业社建立雨量站、乡乡建观测站、沿河建水位、水文站，做到社社有点，乡乡有站，现在已派人到各地协助建站工作。
    今年黄河的防汛工作抓得紧，动手早。在4月中到5月初，水利电力部和地方有关部门就组织了检查团，对河南、山东境内黄河重要堤段做了检查。沿河防汛机构都要提前恢复办公，并对沿河堤防进行复查。黄河水利委员会和治淮委员会最近还分别召开了黄河、淮河流域防汛会议。会议反复强调要从思想上、组织上做好进一步动员和准备。治淮委员会特别提醒沿河各省要注意小型水库的防护工作，抓紧结尾工程，汛前不能完工的水库要先开好溢洪道，加强检查，发现问题及时补救。
    松花江的堤防整修工程从去秋到现在几乎没有间断。为了接受以往教训，黑龙江省从去冬到现在准备了大批的防汛用的草袋，做到有备无患。
    入夏以来，南方地区不断降雨。湖南、江西等省雨量较大，超出了历年同期雨量。5月份湖南省湘、资、沅、澧四水相继出现了洪峰。由于发挥了共产主义协作精神和通力合作，全省人民连续战胜了七次较大洪水。现在每个重点地段、工程都有人负责防护。江西省沿江人民也组织了防汛抢险队伍，对圩堤险段进行了加高、加固和加强防守，同时加强了对水利灌溉工程的养护管理，适当的挖深了溢洪道以利洪水的宣泄。
    根据气象部门预报，6月份长江流域仍然多雨，湖北等省已召开了紧急会议，对防汛做了安排。
