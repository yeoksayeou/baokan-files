Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: People from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand farewell meeting this afternoon at the National Art Theater to bid farewell to the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea.

At 4:00 PM, Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, along with General Xiao Yingtang, representative of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Xie Zhenhua, head of the delegation of the second group of Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, and Deputy Head General Wang Yi, ascended the rostrum, and the audience burst into warm applause. A huge banner was hung at the top of the rostrum: "Glory Belongs to the Heroic Officers and Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army."

Korean Deputy Premiers Kim Il, Ri Joo-yeon, Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, members of the Presidium of the Fatherland Front Kim Dal-hyun, Hong Ki-hwang, cabinet ministers, ministers of various departments of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, and representatives of people from all walks of life in Pyongyang, more than a thousand people, attended the meeting.

Five hundred representatives of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, Cheng Wenjin, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and diplomatic envoys and embassy personnel from various countries in Korea were also invited to attend the meeting.

Chung Il-yong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean People's Welcome Committee for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a farewell speech at the meeting. He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all the Korean people, the Workers' Party of Korea, and the government of the Republic, to all the officers and soldiers of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, who had victoriously completed the glorious task of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" and were about to return to their motherland. He said that you shed noble blood in Korea to oppose the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the American aggressors—and to defend peace. Today, you are withdrawing from Korea to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. Your great achievements in Korea will be remembered forever in Korea.

Chung Il-yong said that the Korean and Chinese governments have made consistent efforts to guide the Korean armistice towards a consolidated peace and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. This time, they have taken even greater measures to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The first group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea has been completely withdrawn, and the second group is about to begin its withdrawal. However, the American imperialists are still attempting to continue to occupy South Korea by force and have recently transported atomic and rocket weapons into South Korea, attempting to turn South Korea into a criminal atomic war base and aggravate the tense situation in Korea and the Far East.

Chung Il-yong emphasized that the American aggressors should quickly withdraw from the land of Korea, and they have no excuse to continue to occupy South Korea by force. The Korean people must realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

Chung Il-yong's speech was interrupted from time to time by bursts of thunderous applause.

Then, Kim Yong-jin, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, presented flags and gifts on behalf of the working people of Pyongyang to the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea. General Xie Zhenhua and General Wang Yi accepted the gifts. There were more than 8,000 gifts in total.

Next, General Xie Zhenhua delivered a thank-you speech amidst warm applause. He first expressed his deep and sincere gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and all the Korean people, and said that he would definitely bring the deep friendship of the Korean people to the people of the motherland.

General Xie Zhenhua said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army have forged a combat friendship as high as the mountains and as deep as the sea in more than seven years of long-term struggle and life. The Korean people's heroic, tenacious, and indomitable revolutionary heroism and great internationalist spirit are examples for all the officers and soldiers of our Volunteer Army to learn from.

General Xie Zhenhua said that after the first group of troop withdrawals, the second group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, totaling 100,000 people, will also withdraw from Korea. However, the U.S. military has not only not taken measures to withdraw from Korea, but has instead turned South Korea into an American atomic base. This criminal act by the United States has become the only obstacle to achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. The United States must immediately withdraw its invading troops from South Korea; otherwise, it cannot escape the blame for obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

After the meeting, artists from various art groups in Pyongyang performed brilliant programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 26th: Korean Premier Kim Il-sung held a cabinet banquet tonight to welcome the representatives of officers and soldiers of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea.

Those attending the banquet included Korean Deputy Premiers Kim Il, Chung Il-yong, and Ri Joo-yeon, Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae and Park Kum-chul, members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front Kim Dal-hyun and Hong Ki-hwang, Korean cabinet ministers, ministers of various departments of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, and well-known figures from all walks of life.

General Xie Zhenhua, head of the delegation of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, Deputy Head General Wang Yi, and 500 representatives of officers and soldiers, as well as General Xiao Yingtang, representative of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, were invited to attend the banquet.

Cheng Wenjin, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and embassy personnel, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries in Korea, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Kim Il-sung first delivered a speech at the banquet. On behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and all the Korean people, he extended his deep gratitude and highest honor to the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers. He said that you, cultivated by the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have fully demonstrated to the people of the world that you are a true people's army, a true Marxist-Leninist party's army, and a true internationalist army. The merits you have established will forever radiate light along with our beautiful mountains and rivers. The deep friendship you have forged with the Korean people will forever remain in the hearts of the Korean people, generation after generation.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the People's Republic of China has consistently provided tremendous assistance both materially and spiritually for the freedom and happiness of the Korean people. At the same time, it has always made sincere efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completed the first phase of troop withdrawals and has now entered the second phase of troop withdrawals.

Premier Kim Il-sung said: It is the American imperialists who are obstructing the reunification of Korea and preventing our nation from embarking on a brighter tomorrow. The American imperialists should immediately withdraw from the land of Korea. The Korean people, as a glorious member of the powerful socialist camp, must drive the American imperialists out of the land of Korea and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

General Xie Zhenhua, head of the delegation of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, then spoke. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the second group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, the Korean people, and the comrades of the People's Army!

General Xie Zhenhua said that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples is truly higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea. The hearts of all the officers and soldiers of the second group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army withdrawing from Korea will forever be linked with the Korean people. We will always cherish the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. We will continue to work together for the cause of socialist construction and the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

General Xiao Yingtang, representative of the headquarters of the Volunteer Army, also spoke at the banquet.

During the banquet, the guests frequently toasted to the health of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

Korean artists from Pyongyang performed artistic programs at the banquet.

    中朝人民的战斗友谊山高海深
    平壤开大会欢送志愿军归国部队
    金日成首相举行内阁宴会送别志愿军官兵代表
    新华社平壤26日电　平壤市各界人民今天下午在国立艺术剧场举行盛大的欢送大会，欢送中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜的部队。
    下午四时，朝鲜内阁首相金日成同中国人民志愿军总部代表萧应棠将军、志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队代表团团长谢振华将军、副团长汪易将军等登上主席台，全场响起热烈的掌声。主席台的上端高悬着巨幅标语：“光荣属于英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵”。
    朝鲜内阁副首相金一、李周渊，劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲，祖国战线议长团成员金达铉、洪箕璜等，内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长，各民主政党社会团体的负责人，和平壤市各界人民代表等一千多人参加了大会。
    中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队代表五百人，中国驻朝大使馆临时代办程文津和各国驻朝使节、使馆人员也应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜欢送中国人民志愿军中央委员会委员长郑一龙在大会上致欢送词。他首先以全体朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的名义，向胜利完成了“抗美援朝”光荣任务、即将返回祖国的中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队的全体官兵表示衷心的感谢。他说，你们为了反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美国侵略者，为了保卫和平，在朝鲜洒下了高贵的鲜血。今天，你们为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决和巩固远东及世界和平，从朝鲜撤出。你们在朝鲜建立的丰功伟绩，将在朝鲜万古流芳。
    郑一龙说，朝中两国政府为了把朝鲜停战导向巩固的和平，促进朝鲜的和平统一进行了一贯的努力。这次又为和平解决朝鲜问题采取了更大措施。中国人民志愿军第一批撤出朝鲜的部队已经撤完，第二批又要开始撤退了。但美帝国主义者仍企图继续强占南朝鲜，并在最近把原子和火箭武器运进南朝鲜，企图把南朝鲜变为罪恶的原子战争基地，加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势。
    郑一龙强调说，美国侵略者应该迅速地从朝鲜的土地上撤出，他们没有任何借口继续强占南朝鲜。朝鲜人民一定要实现祖国的和平统一。
    郑一龙的讲话不时被一阵阵春雷般的掌声打断。
    接着，平壤市人民委员会委员长金容镇代表平壤市劳动人民向中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队献旗献礼。谢振华将军和汪易将军受礼。礼物共有八千多件。
    接着，谢振华将军在热烈的掌声中致答谢词。他首先向朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民致以深切诚挚的谢意，并表示一定把朝鲜人民的深情厚谊带给祖国的人民。
    谢振华将军说，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在七年多长期斗争和生活中结成了如同山高海深的战斗友谊。朝鲜人民英勇顽强、不屈不挠的革命英雄主义和伟大的国际主义精神，是我们志愿军全体官兵学习的榜样。
    谢振华将军说，中国人民志愿军继第一批撤军后，第二批部队共十万人，也即将撤出朝鲜。但美军不仅没有采取从朝鲜撤出的措施，反而把南朝鲜变为美国的原子基地。美国这种罪恶行为已成为争取朝鲜和平统一的唯一的障碍。美国必须立刻从南朝鲜撤出他的侵略军队，不然，他就不能逃避阻碍朝鲜和平统一的罪责。
    大会结束后，平壤市各艺术团体的艺术家们表演了精采的节目。
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成今晚举行内阁宴会，欢送中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队的官兵代表。

    中国人民志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队代表团团长谢振华将军、副团长汪易将军和五百名官兵代表以及中国人民志愿军总部代表萧应棠将军，应邀参加了宴会。
    应邀参加宴会的还有中国驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办程文津和使馆人员以及各国驻朝使节。
    金日成首相首先在宴会上致词。他代表朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民，向志愿军官兵同志致以深切的感谢和最大的荣誉。他说，由光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席培育下的你们，向全世界人民充分显示了你们是真正的人民军队，是真正的马克思列宁主义党的军队，是真正的国际主义的军队。你们建立的功勋，将和我国的美丽江山一起，永远放射着光芒。你们同朝鲜人民之间结成的深厚友谊，将永远留在朝鲜人民子子孙孙的心中。
    金日成首相说，中华人民共和国为了朝鲜人民的自由和幸福，一贯在物质上和精神上给予巨大的帮助。同时，为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，也始终一贯地进行着真挚的努力。中国人民志愿军已经完成第一批撤军，现已进入第二批撤军的阶段。
    金日成首相说：阻挠朝鲜的统一，阻挠我们民族走上更加繁荣的明天的道路的就是美帝国主义者。美帝国主义应当立即从朝鲜的土地上撤出。作为强大的社会主义阵营光荣成员的朝鲜人民，一定要把美帝国主义从朝鲜的土地上赶出去，实现祖国的和平统一。
    志愿军第二批撤出朝鲜部队代表团团长谢振华将军接着讲话。他代表中国人民志愿军第二批撤出部队全体官兵向金日成首相、朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、朝鲜人民和人民军同志，表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    谢振华将军说，中朝两国人民兄弟般的友谊，真是比高山还高，比大海还深。中国人民志愿军第二批撤离朝鲜的全体官兵的心，将永远和朝鲜人民联系在一起。我们将永远珍惜中朝人民之间的战斗友谊。我们为了社会主义建设和保卫远东及世界和平的事业，将继续共同努力。
