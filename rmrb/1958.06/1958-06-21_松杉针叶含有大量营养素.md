    The Dailing Forestry Bureau in the Xiaoxinganling forest area started raising more than 3,000 chicks in May of this year. They specially used spruce and pine needles mixed with feed. Now, the dozens of chickens being tested have grown to more than 1.4 jin in weight, which is larger than chickens raised with ordinary feed. This is because the needles contain a large amount of protein, carotene, valuable vitamin E, and phytoncides that can prevent gastrointestinal diseases in animals and poultry. The feeding method is to dry the needles and grind them into needle powder, mixing 3% to 10% into the feed.
    Now, the Dailing Forestry Bureau is preparing to feed all of its existing 3,000-plus chickens with this mixed feed and is also preparing to promote its use in cattle and sheep feed.

    松杉针叶含有大量营养素
    小兴安岭林区带岭林业实验局，从今年5月开始养了三千多只鸡雏，他们特意用云杉、松树的针叶混拌饲料。现在试养的这几十只鸡已长到一斤四两多重，比用一般饲料饲养的鸡都大。这是因为针叶中含有大量的蛋白质、胡箩卜素、珍贵的维他命E和能以预防动物、禽类肠胃病的植物杀菌素。饲养的方法是将针叶干燥后磨成针叶粉，在饲料中混拌3％到10％。
    现在带岭林业实验局准备将现有的三千多只鸡全部用这种混拌饲料饲养，并准备在牛羊饲料中也试行推广。
