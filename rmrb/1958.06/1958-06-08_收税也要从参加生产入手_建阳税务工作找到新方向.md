Tax Collection Should Also Start with Participation in Production
　　Jianyang Tax Work Finds New Direction

　　(Our report) Can tax work achieve a Great Leap Forward? This question has already been correctly answered in the practice of cadres at the Jianyang County Tax Bureau in Fujian Province. Their answer is: Raise more hens to lay more eggs; start with caring about production, participating in production, and leading production to cultivate tax sources and increase tax revenue. Before the rectification campaign, tax cadres pitted tax collection against production. Many tax cadres believed that tax collection was simply asking the masses for money and would conflict with the interests of the masses. Therefore, they could not use the mass line method to collect taxes and could only use administrative orders. This fostered a work style of coercion and command divorced from the masses among some cadres. At the same time, some of the masses believed that all cadres came to give money to the masses, and only tax cadres came to ask the masses for money. Therefore, during the Great Leap Forward in various tasks, tax cadres felt unjustified, lacking confidence, and unable to muster enthusiasm.

　　After the rectification campaign, these erroneous ideas were criticized, and Jianyang County tax cadres found a direction for a Great Leap Forward by starting with production to cultivate tax sources. Led by the bureau chief, they went to seven districts and four state-owned and joint state-private enterprises to work on experimental production plots and tax experimental plots. In Houshan, Mafu, Tangyuan, Ankou, and other four townships, they helped agricultural cooperatives solve many difficulties such as labor, capital, fertilizer, and pig feed. They also tried to help the masses connect various production, supply, and sales relationships, overcoming difficulties such as insufficient means of production and slow sales of agricultural and sideline products. With the help of tax cadres, the four townships newly cultivated tea gardens, raised pigs, etc., which can increase income by more than 90,000 yuan this year and increase national tax revenue by 25,000 yuan. More importantly, it changed the masses' view that tax cadres only care about collecting taxes and do not care about production. Now, using blackboards and big-character posters to publicize policies to tax evaders and tax defaulters, some even put big-character posters on the doors of tax evaders and tax defaulters to carry out criticism and education. After this series of work, the vast majority of the masses understood the tax policy and their relationship to it. Through self-reporting and whistleblowing, the county handled 552 cases of previously outstanding tax evasion and arrears.

　　Currently, Jianyang County has become the first "three-no's" (no errors, no omissions, no arrears) model county in Fujian for implementing tax policies. The county's tax plan has also increased by 36% compared to last year. Through the rectification campaign, the concept of who tax cadres serve has also been clearly established, and many unreasonable rules and regulations have been abolished. They are also actively establishing cooperative relationships with the industrial and commercial systems.

### 收税也要从参加生产入手  建阳税务工作找到新方向

　　收税也要从参加生产入手
    建阳税务工作找到新方向
    本报讯　税务工作能不能跃进，这个问题已经在福建省建阳县税务局干部的实践中得出正确的答案。他们的答案是：多养母鸡多生蛋，从关心生产、参加生产、领导生产入手，培养税源，增加税收。整风以前，税收干部把税收同生产对立起来。不少税务干部认为收税就是向群众要钱，就和群众利益发生矛盾，因而不能用群众路线的办法征税，只能用行政命令的办法来征税。在部分干部中滋生了强迫命令脱离群众的作风。同时在少数群众中也有认为什么干部来都是送钱给群众，只有税务干部是向群众要钱的看法。因此，在各项工作大跃进时，税务干部感到理不直、气不壮，鼓不起干劲。
    经过整风，批判了这些错误思想，建阳县税务干部找到了从生产入手培养税源的跃进方向。他们由局长带领，分头到七个区四个国营和公私合营企业搞生产试验田、税收试验田。他们在后山、马伏、塘源、庵口等四个乡帮助农业社解决了劳力、资金、肥料、养猪饲料等许多困难，并且设法帮助群众沟通各种产供销关系，克服了生产资料不足农副产品滞销等困难。在税务干部帮助下，四个乡新垦茶园、养猪等，今年可增加收入九万多元，也为国家增加税收二万五千元。更重要的是转变了群众认为税务干部只管收税不管生产的看法。现在利用黑板报、大字报对漏税、欠税户宣传政策，有的还把大字报送到漏税、欠税户的门上，进行批评教育。经过这一系列的工作，绝大部分群众了解了税收政策和自己的关系，通过自报检举，全县处理了五百五十二件过去遗留的漏欠税问题。
    目前建阳县已成为福建执行税收政策的第一个三无（无错无漏无欠）模范县，全县的税收计划也比去年增长36％，通过整风，税务干部为谁服务的观念也明确地树立起来，并取消了许多不合理的规章制度，积极和工商系统建立协作关系。
