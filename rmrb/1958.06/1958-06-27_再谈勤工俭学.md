    Re-discussing Work-Study Programs
    Xiang Nan
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call for work-study programs, such programs have been widely implemented in universities, colleges, and secondary schools throughout the country. However, like other work, work-study programs also involve a struggle between two paths.
    From the following two different poems, one can see two different attitudes toward work-study programs. A student from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wrote:
    Without spring breezes, flowers won't bloom,
    Without planting trees, fruits won't come,
    If not for diligence and frugality in work and study,
    How can one achieve both redness and expertise?
    A middle school student in Yunnan, however, expressed his feelings in this way:
    Since ancient times, raising the flag of study was esteemed,
    How could one abandon books for labor?
    Raising our heads, we sit steadily in tall buildings,
    Caring little whether the grain is shriveled or full.
    One side is the red flag, the other is the white flag, the distinction is very clear. It seems that to plant red flags on every position in the work-study program will require a struggle and a lot of persuasive work, but the majority of students are holding high the red flag. They not only understand theoretically that "combining productive labor with intellectual education is not only a method of increasing social production but also the only method of producing fully developed human beings" (Marx), and that "the ideal of the future society is unimaginable without combining the teaching of the younger generation with productive labor" (Lenin), but also see from their own practice that there are great gains from implementing work-study programs: First, it cultivates students' love for labor and the ideology and feelings of love for workers and peasants, and begins to establish a good atmosphere of hard work and plain living in schools. "All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior" has changed to "Hoe plus pen, labor is the most glorious." In the past, some were unwilling to admit that their parents were workers and peasants, but now they bring their parents to the school to visit. The atmosphere of washing clothes, mending, caring for public property, and cherishing food has begun to be established. Second, students learn production knowledge and labor skills, and improve the quality of learning. Many students have learned the skills of fitter, carpenter, fertilizer accumulation, rice transplanting, seedling cultivation, and plowing. Some students at Shenyang Machine Manufacturing School have reached the level of fourth or fifth grade workers. Because learning is combined with practice, it is easy to achieve thorough understanding and inspire students to think independently. Therefore, students' grades have generally improved, and school education has changed from "three separations" to "three diligences" – diligence and thrift in running schools, diligence in work-study programs, and diligence in production. Third, it enhances physical fitness. Headaches, stomach problems, colds, and other illnesses have significantly decreased. Students report that there are "two fragrances" and "three increases" after implementing work-study programs. "Two fragrances" are eating well and sleeping well; "three increases" are bigger hands, bigger arms, and greater strength. It is said that labor is the best way to cure neurasthenia. Fourth, it saves the country's expenses and solves some students' living difficulties. Students in Liaoning Province completed a total of six million workdays by the end of April. Students in Shenyang and Dalian alone can save the country nearly 20 million yuan throughout the year. These examples can illustrate that the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of reading while working and combining education with productive labor is completely correct. Work-study programs embody the fine tradition of our Party in running education in the old liberated areas and are indeed one of the fundamental measures for cultivating both red and expert intellectuals and reforming school education.
    But this does not mean that no one opposes or doubts the work-study program. It is not so easy to change the phenomenon of separation between education and production that has existed for thousands of years. In today's situation, the opposition just doesn't dare to adopt methods of open opposition. Whether it is opposition or doubt, it is nothing more than saying that work-study programs will reduce the quality of education; second, it will disrupt the normal order of the school and disrupt the teaching plan.
    Will it reduce the quality of education? To solve this problem, we must first clarify what is meant by quality of education, is it that the quality of education refers to reading well, or is it being able to read and labor? Does quality of education only refer to cultural and scientific knowledge in books, or does it include moral, intellectual, and physical education, to "become a worker with socialist consciousness and culture" as Chairman Mao said? We believe that the quality of education should be the latter, not the former. Our party has always believed that reading is learning, and labor practice is also learning, and more importantly learning. Work-study programs can enable students to use their hands and brains, be versatile, both red and expert, and develop in an all-round way to achieve the quality of education we require. Those with bourgeois educational viewpoints do not look at the quality of education in this way. They only want you to learn book knowledge well in the classroom and get 100 points, regardless of whether you get zero points in practice and labor. This method of only reading and not working is really the worst learning method. The result of training people under this bourgeois educational policy is that rice experts can't grow rice, students from agricultural colleges can't tell the difference between lint and seed cotton, or they are active in learning book knowledge but politically backward, and some students usually get 100 points in their homework but are rightists politically. Isn't this a profound lesson? Therefore, it is not the work-study program that reduces the quality of education. On the contrary, learning detached from production, detached from politics, detached from reality, and not implementing work-study programs is the fundamental reason for the poor quality of education. This is the case in theory, but what is the actual situation? A student at Zhengzhou Health School said: "In the past, we took notes in class, compared notes after class, memorized notes for the exam, and forgot them after the exam; now there is theory, practice, easy to understand, easy to remember, can speak, can use." Originally, when some graduates of textile schools went to factories to weave, the workers did not dare to let them touch the machines, fearing that they would produce defective products as soon as they intervened, but when they mastered the technology in actual operation, not only did they not produce defective products, but they also rapidly increased production, thus being welcomed by the workers. Of course, if classroom learning and production labor are not arranged well, they may also affect the quality of learning, so we must also pay attention to the method at the same time, implement comprehensive arrangements, carefully summarize the experience in this area, and constantly overcome shortcomings, but this does not affect the correctness of the work-study program.
    Another reason for opposing work-study programs is that they disrupt the normal order of the school and disrupt the teaching plan. We say that it depends on what normal order is disrupted and what teaching plan is disrupted. An important feature of our new socialist school is that learning life is closely integrated with the nationwide struggle to build socialism. We are opposed to reading behind closed doors and running schools behind closed doors. If we think that the work-study program has opened the school gates and guided students from books to the vigorous social life, and the original "quiet academic atmosphere" of the school has been destroyed, then we say that the destruction is too good, not only to be destroyed, but also to be greatly destroyed and especially destroyed, the more thorough the destruction, the better. If it is thought that work-study programs will disrupt the teaching plan, then the past teaching plan originally ignored productive labor and did not have labor courses. Now, labor courses are added to the plan and gradually fixed as a system. What is wrong with that? If it is said that the work-study program will increase the busyness in the school, and therefore there will be another "anti-busyness," it is wrong. The work-study program is a new thing, and it is coming on strong. It is impossible for there to be no problems in such a vigorous mass movement. But how big are the problems? It's nothing more than the problem of nine and a half fingers and half a finger. There have been too many lessons from anti-busyness in the past. Every time there is anti-busyness in the school, it is actually anti-political work, anti-movement, and anti-Party and League work. Of course, learning should have learning discipline and learning order, but it is by no means to maintain the isolated study life of the old education. The experience of the past few years since liberation shows that whenever a movement arises in society and the school education work is well integrated with this movement, the students' consciousness will be raised very quickly, otherwise, the school's political atmosphere will decline, like "a pool of stagnant water." Since the anti-rightist, the nationwide rectification, and the implementation of work-study programs, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of students has been unprecedentedly improved, once again showing that it is ridiculous to study, to make revolution, and to be afraid of engaging in movements. In the early stage of implementing work-study programs, individual schools excessively emphasized economic indicators, and some places had excessive labor volume, which made teachers and students feel a little tired, but the nature of this shortcoming is a matter of method. The method can be improved. At the same time, the emergence of certain shortcomings is also related to our lack of leadership and our failure to help solve specific problems in a timely manner. We should first see the extremely valuable revolutionary enthusiasm of these schools, and we should not pour cold water. Now, these shortcomings have been overcome under the leadership of the Party, and the current problem is that some places have relaxed their efforts, which is more worthy of attention.
    There is another wrong argument that work-study programs are suitable for rural areas, but not for urban areas; that rural conditions are good and urban conditions are poor. Facts have proved that urban schools also have very good conditions for carrying out work-study programs, such as many factories, many craftsmen, and strong support from all aspects. As long as they obtain factory support, they can quickly establish factories. It can be seen that the problem lies in whether they have the determination. Jilin City's fifteen ordinary middle schools have built a total of six small-scale integrated factories (including thirty-two workshops) and seven single-item factories, and almost every school has a factory. They are also linked to some other factories and cooperatives. This proves that things are man-made. As long as we are determined to do it, schools can definitely run factories. Since the Party Central Committee proposed to vigorously develop local industries, most of the cooperatives in the countryside have been able to run several factories. The conditions of schools are much better than those of cooperatives. Why can cooperatives run factories, but schools cannot? It is not only possible to carry out work-study programs in cities, but also particularly necessary. We say that some young students cannot distinguish between the five grains, which mainly refers to urban students. They usually have the least opportunity to work and have the worst work habits. They especially need labor training. At present, on the issue of work-study programs, some people think that cities are not as good as rural areas, large cities are not as good as small and medium-sized cities, and universities are not as good as middle schools, which shows that it is not a matter of conditions, but a matter of thought. As long as we exert our energy and strive for the upstream, urban schools can also carry out productive labor.
    In order to widely and persistently carry out work-study programs, the most important task at present is to continue to eliminate ideological obstacles. We must carry out resolute struggles against those who fundamentally oppose our Party's education policy. More people are not deliberately opposed, but because they have not fully seen the benefits of work-study programs, and we still lack experience and cannot come up with more and more mature models, so they are skeptical. For this kind of people, on the one hand, we must patiently persuade them, and on the other hand, we need to wait. We will make achievements, and they will be convinced. In short, work-study programs are also a struggle between two roads and two methods, and it will not be smooth sailing. In addition to eliminating ideological obstacles, we must also constantly summarize experience, discover problems, and properly and promptly solve the following problems.
    Regarding the issue of productive labor time. Many places have paid attention to distinguishing between the different situations of vocational schools and ordinary schools. Agricultural middle schools, technical schools, and technical schools can basically implement half-work and half-study, that is, half-day of studying and half-day of labor. In some schools, the amount of labor can be more than half a day or less than half a day; universities and ordinary middle schools mostly implement the "one, one, five" or "one, two, nine" method. "One, one, five" means one day of rest, one day of labor, and five days of class each week. "One, two, nine" means one month of vacation, two months of labor, and nine months of class a year. Many places have also paid attention to the different situations of various schools. For example, the labor time for the first grade of junior high school can be less, and the labor time for industrial and agricultural colleges can be more. Too short a time cannot enable students to get the necessary exercise in labor. Marx said that in a reasonable social system, all children should participate in productive labor without exception from the age of nine. As a middle school student or college student, the labor time should not be too short, because without a certain quantity, there will be no certain quality. Of course, the weight of labor and the length of labor time should also take into account the students' age, gender, and physical conditions.
    Regarding the issue of labor avenues. We should actively create conditions. Some places have dozens of types of labor in one school, which proves that there are many labor avenues. But the core issue is to set up farms and factories in rural and urban areas respectively. Urban schools mainly run factories, while rural schools run both farms and factories. In this way, students can not only receive labor training, but also have the opportunity to combine it with book knowledge, so that the school has a production base and that every student has the basic knowledge and skills of carpentry, metalworking, and agricultural production. Regarding the issue of production indicators, at the beginning of work-study programs, some schools overemphasized economic indicators, which needs to be improved, but we cannot completely fail to mention economic requirements or production indicators. Labor without certain economic requirements cannot better organize and exert the enthusiasm of the masses, cannot effectively improve students' skills, increase students' knowledge, and cannot well cultivate students' habit of abiding by labor discipline. Educational requirements and production requirements are consistent. It is difficult to achieve educational results to engage in labor without specific indicators. What is the difference between harvesting only ninety kilograms of rice per mu and a lazy person? The past school practice factories were only consuming materials and not engaging in production. This kind of labor education can hardly be said to be fake and formalistic. Under the premise of giving prominence to politics, as long as we do not reluctantly propose the slogan of self-sufficiency for several years, it is beneficial to put forward a realistic production requirement.
    Regarding the issue of combining students with workers and peasants. In addition to students practicing in school factories and farms, they should also eat, live, and work with workers and peasants for a period of time each year as much as possible. The methods are: on the one hand, use holidays to organize students to go to factories and the countryside to participate in some productive labor; on the other hand, link up with factories and cooperatives outside the school so that schools and production units can often support each other. In this way, workers and peasants can bring their ideas and technologies into the school and use the materials of factories and agricultural cooperatives to support the school; students can participate in the labor of factories and the countryside to help workers and peasants learn culture and carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. At present, special attention should be paid to combining work-study programs with technological revolution and tool improvement. After the great development of secondary and higher education, a team of tens of millions of people will emerge across the country, which is a very large force. After their book knowledge is combined with productive labor, it will not only benefit their own learning, but also greatly benefit the promotion of production and the improvement of tools. For example, Li Tongxiang of Zhengzhou Water Conservancy School worked hard in the rural water conservancy construction and created a wooden theodolite, which has now been widely promoted. Many schools have also played a great role in helping rural areas install small power stations, pot-camel machines, and run chemical factories.
    Regarding the issue of distribution. Except for private schools, according to the existing experience in most areas, there are roughly two methods: First, most of it goes to the public. This refers to the half-work and half-study schools run by the state. The students' expenses are all borne by the state, so the labor income should mostly belong to the school, and a small part should be used for labor bonuses; second, most of it is used for the school's collective undertakings, and a small part is given to students. This refers to the labor income of general ordinary middle schools and liberal arts and economics universities. The labor time of these schools is not long, and the income is limited. The distribution method should advocate the communist spirit and be uniformly distributed by the school. However, in addition to a part for poor students for subsidies and student bonuses, the rest should be mostly used for the school's collective welfare undertakings and production funds. And it is necessary to implement a system of periodic public announcement of accounts. Of course, these practices cannot be said to be mature experience. How should the distribution be done appropriately? We need to further accumulate experience.
    Whether education is combined with productive labor or separated is a watershed that distinguishes socialist education from bourgeois education. It can be said that implementing work-study programs is a major revolution in China's education work. All students and education workers who sincerely support the socialist education line should resolutely fight against the bourgeois educational viewpoint that separates from politics and separates from production, and hold high the red flag of reading and working, working hard and studying diligently, and moving forward.

    再谈勤工俭学
    项南
    从党中央提出勤工俭学的号召以后，勤工俭学已经在全国各个高等学校和中等学校中广泛开展起来。但是，如同其他工作一样，勤工俭学也存在两条道路的斗争。
    从下面两首不同的诗中，可以看出对勤工俭学两种不同的态度。一个内蒙古自治区的学生这样写道：
    春风不吹花不开，
    树木不栽果不来，
    若非勤工又俭学，
    哪得红专一齐来。
    一个云南的中学生却这样来发抒自己的感情：
    自古扬旗读书高，
    哪有劳动把书抛，
    举首稳坐高楼上，
    管它谷子瘪与饱。
    一面是红旗，一面是白旗，分得十分清楚。看来，要在勤工俭学这个阵地上都插上红旗，还会有一番斗争，还需要做很多的说服工作，但高举红旗的学生是多数。他们不只是从理论上懂得“把生产劳动和智育体育结合起来，这不仅是增加社会生产的方法，并且是唯一的生产一个全面发展的人类的方法。”（马克思）懂得“如果不把青年一代的教学和生产劳动结合起来，未来社会的理想是不能想像的。”（列宁）而且从自己的实践中看出，实行勤工俭学以后有了很大的收获：第一，培养了学生热爱劳动，热爱工农的思想感情，开始在学校中树立起艰苦朴素的好风气。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”变成了“锄头加笔杆，劳动最光荣”。过去不愿意承认自己的父母是工农的，现在却把父母带到学校里来参观了。自己洗衣服，缝补，爱护公物，爱惜粮食的风气开始树立起来了。第二，学习了生产知识和劳动技能，提高了学习质量。很多学生学会了钳工、木工、积肥、插秧、育苗、犁地的技术。沈阳机器制造学校有些学生已经达到四级或五级工人的水平。由于学习结合实际，就容易做到融会贯通，启发学生独立思考，因此学生的成绩一般都上升了，学校教育由“三脱离”变成了“三勤”——勤俭办学，勤工俭学，勤劳生产。第三，增强了体质。头痛、胃病、伤风感冒等病显著减少了。学生反映勤工俭学以后有“二香”，“三大”。“二香”是吃饭香，睡觉香；“三大”是手大、胳臂大、力气大。说劳动是治神经衰弱的最好的办法。第四，节约了国家的开支，解决了一部分学生生活的困难，辽宁全省的学生到4月底止共做了六百万个劳动日，仅沈阳、大连两市高等学校的学生全年就可以给国家节约近两千万元。这些事例都可以说明，党和毛主席所提出的一面读书一面劳动、实行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，是完全正确的。勤工俭学体现了我们党在老解放区办教育的优良传统，的确是培养又红又专的知识分子和革新学校教育的根本措施之一。
    但这并不等于说，对勤工俭学这件事情已经没有人反对、没有人怀疑了。要改变几千年来教育和生产脱节的现象，并不是那么容易的，反对派在今天这样的情况下，只是不敢采取公然反对的办法罢了。不管反对也罢，怀疑也罢，无非一是说勤工俭学会降低教育质量；二是说破坏了学校的正常秩序，打乱了教学计划。
    会不会降低教育质量呢？对于这个问题，首先要弄清楚什么叫教育质量，是不是教育质量就是指的要读好书，还是又会读书又会劳动？教育质量是单指书本上的文化科学知识，还是包括德育、智育、体育几个方面，像毛主席所说的“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，我们认为，教育质量应当是后者，而不是前者。我们党一向认为，读书是学习，劳动实践也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。勤工俭学，正可以使学生做到手脑并用，能文能武，又红又专，全面发展，达到我们所要求的教育质量。那些有资产阶级教育观点的人，却不是这样来看教育质量，他们只要你在课堂上学好书本知识，打上一百分，根本不管你在实践中、劳动中是不是打零分。这种只读书，不劳动的方法，实在是最坏的学习方法。在这种资产阶级教育方针下培养出来的人，其结果就是水稻专家不会种水稻，农学院出来的学生分不清什么叫皮棉什么叫籽棉，或者是学习书本知识是个积极分子，政治上是个落后分子，有些学生平时的功课是一百分，政治上却是个右派，这不是一个深刻的教训吗？所以不是勤工俭学降低教育质量，恰恰相反，学习脱离生产、脱离政治、脱离实际，不实行勤工俭学，才是教育质量不高的根本原因。理论上如此，实际情况又如何？郑州卫生学校一个学生说：“过去是上课记笔记，下课对笔记，考试背笔记，考完就忘记；现在是有理论、有实际、易懂、易记、会讲、会用。”原来有些纺织学校的毕业生到工厂织布的时候，工人不敢让他们动手碰机器，怕他们一插手就出废品，而当他们在实际操作中掌握了技术以后，不但不出废品，而且使生产迅速地提高，因而受到工人的欢迎。当然，课堂学习和生产劳动如果安排不好，也可能影响学习质量，所以必须同时很好注意方法问题，实行全面安排，认真地总结这方面的经验，不断地克服缺点，但这丝毫不影响勤工俭学这个方针的正确性。
    反对勤工俭学的另一个理由，是说勤工俭学破坏了学校的正常秩序，打乱了教学计划。我们说，这要看破坏了什么正常秩序，什么教学计划。我们社会主义新型的学校的一个重要的特征，就是学习生活是和建设社会主义的全民斗争紧密结合的。我们反对关门读书，关门办学校，如果认为勤工俭学起了打开校门的作用，把学生从书本引导到蓬勃的社会生活中去，原来学校的那种关门读书的“宁静的学府空气”被破坏了，那么我们说破坏得太好了，不但要破，而且要大破、特破，破的越彻底越好。如果认为勤工俭学会打乱教学计划，那么，过去教学计划中本来就忽视生产劳动，没有劳动课，现在在计划中加上劳动课程，并且逐渐把它固定下来，成为制度，有什么不好。如果说，勤工俭学一来，会增加学校忙乱，因而又要来一个“反忙乱”，那是错误的。勤工俭学是一件新事物，来势很猛，在这么轰轰烈烈的群众运动中不出一点问题，是不可能的。但是又有多大的问题呢？无非是九个半指头和半个指头的问题。过去反忙乱的教训太多了。学校中每一次反忙乱，实际上就是反政治工作，反运动，反党团工作。当然，学习应当有学习纪律，学习秩序，但决不是为了保持旧教育那种与世隔绝的书斋生活。解放几年来的经验说明，每当社会上兴起一个什么运动，而学校教育工作跟这个运动又结合得很好的时候，学生的觉悟就提高得很快，反之，学校的政治空气就下降，就像“一潭死水”。反右派、全民整风和实行勤工俭学以来，广大学生的社会主义觉悟空前提高，再一次说明搞学习，搞革命而又怕搞运动是可笑的。在实行勤工俭学的初期，个别学校过份强调了经济指标，有的地方劳动量过大，使得师生都感到有些疲劳，但这个缺点的性质是方法问题。方法是可以改善的。同时，某些缺点的产生，也与我们领导不够，及时帮助解决具体问题不够有关。我们首先应当看到这些学校极可宝贵的革命热情，而不应当泼冷水。现在，这些缺点，已经在党的领导下克服了，现在的问题是有些地方松了劲，倒是更值得注意的。
    还有另外一个错误论点，认为勤工俭学适合在农村搞，不适合在城市搞；说农村的条件好，城市的条件差。事实证明，城市学校开展勤工俭学，同样有很好的条件，如工厂多，工匠多，各方面支援的力量大，只要取得工厂支援，很快就能把工厂建立起来，可见问题在于有无决心。吉林市十五所普通中学一共搞了各种小型的综合工厂六所（其中车间有三十二个），单项工厂有七所，差不多每校都有一个工厂。他们还和其它的一些工厂、合作社挂了钩。这证明事在人为，只要决心搞，学校办工厂是一定能办起来的。从党中央提出大办地方工业以来，大部分乡村的合作社都能够办几个工厂，学校的条件比合作社好的多了，为什么合作社能够办，学校就不能办呢？城市搞勤工俭学不仅是可能，而且还特别需要。我们说有些青年学生五谷不分，这主要是指城市的学生，他们平时劳动机会最少，劳动习惯最差，特别需要进行劳动锻炼。目前在勤工俭学这个问题上，有人认为城市不如农村，大城市不如中小城市，大学不如中学，就可说明不是什么条件问题，而是思想问题。只要我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，城市学校同样能够进行生产劳动。
    为了使勤工俭学广泛地、持久地开展起来，目前首要的工作还是要继续破除思想障碍。对那些根本反对我们党的教育方针的，必须和他们进行坚决的斗争。更多的人倒并不是存心反对，而是因为他们还没有完全看到勤工俭学的好处，而我们也还缺乏经验，拿不出更多更成熟的典型来，所以心存怀疑，对这种人，一方面要耐心地加以说服，另一方面则需要加以等待，我们作出了成绩，他们才会信服。总之，勤工俭学也是两条道路和两种方法的斗争，不会是一帆风顺的。除了要破除思想障碍之外，还必须不断总结经验，发现问题，妥善地及时地解决如下一些问题。
    关于生产劳动的时间问题。许多地方已经注意区别专业学校和普通学校的不同情况。像农业中学、技工学校、技术学校，基本上都可以实行半工半读，即半天读书，半天劳动。有些学校，劳动量还可多于半天或少于半天；高等学校、普通中学，大都实行了“一、一、五”或“一、二、九”的办法。“一、一、五”，就是每个星期休息一天，劳动一天，上课五天，“一、二、九”，就是一年里放假一个月，劳动两个月，上课九个月。许多地方还注意到各种学校的不同情况，例如初中一年级的劳动时间还可少些，工、农学院还可多些。时间过短不能使学生在劳动中得到必要的锻炼。马克思说过，在合理的社会制度下，一切儿童从九岁起都应当毫无例外地参加生产劳动。作为一个中学生或大学生，劳动时间是不应当太短的，因为没有一定的数量，就不会有一定的质量。当然劳动的轻重，劳动时间的长短，也应该照顾到学生的年龄、性别和身体条件的。
    关于劳动的门路问题。应当积极创造条件，有些地方一个学校就有几十种，这证明劳动门路是很多的。但核心问题是要分别在农村、城市兴办农场、工厂。城市学校主要办工厂，农村则既办农场、也办工厂。这样，学生既能够受到劳动锻炼，又有可能做到和书本知识相结合，使学校有了一个生产基地，使每个学生都具备木工、金工和农业生产的起码的知识和技术。关于生产指标问题，勤工俭学开始的时候，有的学校过于强调经济指标，这是需要改进的，但是也不能完全不提经济要求，不要生产指标。没有一定的经济要求的劳动，就不能更好地组织和发挥群众的积极性，不能有效地提高学生的技术，增长学生的知识，同时也不能很好地培养学生遵守劳动纪律的习惯。教育要求和生产要求是一致的。搞劳动而又没有具体指标，是难于收到教育效果的，一亩田只收九十斤稻子，这和懒汉有什么区别？过去的学校实习工厂，就是只消耗材料，而不事生产，这种劳动教育很难说不是假的、形式主义的。在政治挂帅的前提下，只要不是勉强去提几年自给的口号，提出一个实事求是的生产要求，是有好处的。
    关于学生和工农结合的问题。学生除了在学校工厂、农场实习而外，每年还要尽可能和工农同吃同住同劳动一个时期。办法是：一方面要利用假期组织学生下工厂、下乡参加一些生产劳动；另方面还要和校外的工厂、合作社挂钩，使学校和生产单位经常互相支援，这样，既使工农的思想、技术进学校，用工厂、农业社的物质来支援学校；又可使学生参加工厂、农村的劳动，帮助工农学文化和开展文娱体育活动。目前特别要注意使勤工俭学和技术革命、改良工具相结合。中等以上的教育大发展以后，全国将要涌现一支拥有几千万人的队伍，这是一支很大的力量。他们的书本知识和生产劳动相结合以后，不但对自己的学习有好处 ，而且对促进生产、改进工具也有很大的好处。例如郑州水利学校李同祥在农村兴修水利劳动中，刻苦钻研，创造了木制经纬仪，现在已经普遍推广。许多学校帮助农村安装小型发电站、锅驼机，办化学工厂，也起了很大的作用。
    关于分配问题。除民办学校外，按照大部地区现有经验，大致有两种办法：一、大部归公。这是指国家所办的半工半读学校，学生的费用全部由国家负担了，所以劳动收入应该大部归学校，小部用作劳动奖金；二、大部用于学校集体事业，小部分给学生。这是指的一般普通中学和文法财经性质的高等学校的劳动收入，这种学校的劳动时间并不长，收入也有限，分配办法应该提倡共产主义精神，由学校统一分配。但统一分配除了一部分给贫苦学生作补助和学生的奖励金之外，其余大部应用于学校的集体福利事业和生产基金。而且要实行按期公布账目的制度。当然，这些做法，还不能说是成熟的经验，究竟应当怎样分配才恰当，还需要进一步积累经验。
    教育与生产劳动相结合还是相分离，这是区别社会主义教育和资产阶级教育的一个分水岭，可以说实行勤工俭学，是我国教育工作上的大革命，一切真心拥护社会主义教育路线的学生和教育工作者，应当坚决和资产阶级脱离政治、脱离生产的教育观点展开斗争，高举一面读书、一面劳动、勤工俭学的红旗前进。
