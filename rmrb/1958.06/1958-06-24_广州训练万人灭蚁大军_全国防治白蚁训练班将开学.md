    Guangzhou Trains a 10,000-Strong Army to Eradicate Ants
    National Termite Prevention Training Class to Open
    (Our Dispatch) Guangzhou is training a 10,000-strong army to eliminate termites, preparing everyone to take action and strive to basically eliminate termites throughout the city by the end of this month.
    For more than a week, in this large southern city of China with a population of over two million, all streets have been successively training termite elimination experts together with government offices, factories, and schools using a method of step-by-step technology transfer. It is required that each residential group in the streets, and each government office, factory, and school, should have at least one person who can basically master the complete set of knowledge and skills such as reconnaissance, applying poisonous drugs to kill, and carrying out prevention. This will ensure that more than 10,000 people throughout the city receive this training and act as commanders in the elimination of termites. The Xinhui City Termite Team, personally trained by termite expert Li Shimei, along with personnel from the Guangzhou Termite Company, are responsible for the training and guidance of this 10,000-strong army.
    According to the plan of the Guangzhou City Anti-“Four Pests” Headquarters, after completing the 10,000-person training work in the next few days, they will immediately and universally impart the technology to residents. It is required that each household should have one person who knows how to discover termites and is responsible for reporting the situation to the street residential group. This will create a mighty termite elimination force of over 400,000 people throughout the city, and then a comprehensive attack will be launched to encircle and annihilate termites, striving to basically eliminate termites throughout the city by the end of this month.
    The famous termite expert Li Shimei will be invited to participate in the key inspection work of street termite elimination during this period, and at the same time, will lecture people on the experience of eliminating termites.
    Termites are a historical and serious insect pest. Recently, it has been discovered that the number of buildings infested with termites in some streets in Guangzhou has reached more than 20%. After the city launched the Anti-“Four Pests” campaign this year, relevant parties, considering the seriousness of the harm caused by termites to national construction and people's welfare, decided to list them, along with cockroaches, bedbugs, and the "four pests," as the "seven pests" that must be eliminated. (Yang Shuqing, He Xing)
    (Our Dispatch) The vanguard of termite elimination from various southern provinces is gathering in Guangzhou to study in the National Termite Prevention Training Class, which will be lectured by termite expert Li Shimei. Currently, there are a total of seventy-three trainees from the National Termite Prevention Training Class who have arrived in Guangzhou. They come from provinces within the province and Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan and Shanghai. Nearly a hundred more trainees will arrive in the next few days.
    In addition to lecturing trainees on the theory of termite prevention and control, termite expert Li Shimei will spend most of his time leading them to the site to impart technical experience.
    This training class is organized by the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Association. The training class is scheduled for one month. Trainees from various provinces and cities are preparing to return and organize termite prevention and control training classes after graduation, organizing teams to launch an annihilation war against termites.

    广州训练万人灭蚁大军
    全国防治白蚁训练班将开学
    本报讯  广州市正在训练消灭白蚁的万人大军，准备人人动手，争取在本月底基本实现消灭全市白蚁。
    一个多星期来，这个拥有二百多万人口的我国南方大城市，全市各街道已陆续和机关、工厂、学校一起，用逐级传授技术的办法，积极训练消灭白蚁能手，要求街道每个居民小组和机关、工厂、学校，最少要有一个人能基本掌握侦查、施用药物毒杀和进行预防等全套知识和技术，使全市有一万多人受到这种训练，作为消灭白蚁的指挥员。由白蚁专家李始美亲自训练的新会城白蚁队，和广州白蚁公司人员一道，担任了这支万人大军的训练和辅导工作。
    根据广州市除“四害”指挥部的计划，在这几天内完成万人训练工作前后，将紧接着通过他们把技术普遍传授给居民，要求做到每户有一个人懂得发现白蚁和负责向街道居民小组报告情况，这样就使全市组成一个有四十万人以上的声势浩大的消灭白蚁队伍，然后全面出击围歼，争取在本月底基本消灭全市白蚁。
    著名白蚁专家李始美，将应邀在此期间参加街道消灭白蚁的重点检查工作，同时向人们讲授消灭白蚁的经验。
    白蚁是一种具有历史性的严重虫害。最近广州一些街道发现有白蚁为害的房屋幢数达到20％以上。今年市里开展除“四害”运动后，有关方面考虑到白蚁对国家建设和人民福利为害的严重性，决定把它和蟑螂、臭虫以及“四害”列为必须消灭的“七害”。（杨淑卿、河星）
    本报讯  南方各省消灭白蚁的尖兵正云集广州，以便在白蚁专家李始美主讲的全国防治白蚁训练班中进行学习。现在已抵广州的全国防治白蚁训练班的学员共有七十三人，他们来自省内和广西、湖南、湖北、福建、江苏、江西、云南、四川等省和上海市。还有近百名学员将在这几天到达。
    白蚁专家李始美除了为学员讲授防治白蚁的理论外，大部分时间将带领他们到现场传授技术经验。
    这个训练班是广东省科联举办的。训练班学习期间预定一个月。各省、市的学员准备结业回去后举办防治白蚁训练班，组织队伍向白蚁进行歼灭战。  （杨淑卿）
