Another deep exploratory well in the Ya'erxia new oilfield in the Jiuquan Basin has gushed a large amount of crude oil during the oil testing process.

This well is Exploratory Well No. 6. From May 31st to June 1st, within twenty-four hours, it continuously gushed 129.5 tons of crude oil from a depth of more than 2,300 meters underground. This is the exploratory well with the largest oil production in the Ya'erxia area to date. The large amount of oil gushing from this well further proves that Ya'erxia is an oilfield with abundant crude oil reserves.

　　鸭儿峡又一深井喷油
    酒泉盆地鸭儿峡新油田上又有一口深探井在试油过程中大量喷出原油。
    这口井是六号探井，它从5月31日到6月1日的二十四小时内，从两千三百多公尺深的地下连续喷出一百二十九点五吨原油，这是鸭儿峡地区到目前止喷油量最多的一口探井。这口井的大量喷油进一步证明了鸭儿峡是个原油储量丰富的油田。
