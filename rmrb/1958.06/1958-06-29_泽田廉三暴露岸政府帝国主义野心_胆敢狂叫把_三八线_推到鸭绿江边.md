Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party members today continued to question Renzo Sawada, the representative of the Kishida Nobusuke government attending the "Japan-South Korea Talks," at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee regarding his imperialist war cries made at the Korean issue symposium. This questioning exposed the imperialist ambitions of the Kishida Nobusuke government.

Sawada Renzo said at the Korean issue symposium held in Tokyo on June 11th that Japan had defeated its opponents on the Korean peninsula in the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. Today, the Kishida Nobusuke government's diplomatic mission is to push the current 38th parallel to the banks of the Yalu River. Sawada also said at the time to Takeo Tanaka, the former Director-General of Political Affairs of the Korean Governor-General's Office, and other criminals who had invaded and ruled the Korean people in the past, that Japan's third trip to Korea would be more meaningful than the current "Japan-South Korea talks."

Sawada Renzo's words are reminiscent of the Japanese imperialist policy after the "Meiji Restoration": to conquer the world, one must first conquer China; to conquer China, one must first conquer the Northeast; to conquer the Northeast, one must first conquer Korea. Under the guidance of this policy, Japan finally annexed Korea in 1910, and then gradually invaded the Northeast, invaded China, and even launched the Pacific War to invade the entire East Asia in 1941.

Socialist Party members Masamichi Onishi and Toshio Tanaka questioned Sawada Renzo today, saying: What do you mean by saying that the current 38th parallel should be pushed to the Yalu River? What do you mean by saying that the current situation in Korea threatens Japan's security? Although Sawada tried to cover up in his reply, his answer further exposed the imperialist face of the Kishida Nobusuke government. He said that because the so-called "communist forces threaten Japan's security," he wanted to "find a way to seek unification for Korea."

The Kishida Nobusuke government's imperialist ambitions have become increasingly apparent during this period. In order to regain its position as the "leader of Asia," it is actively engaged in piecing together a Northeast Asian military bloc. According to a report by the Tokyo correspondent of the Indian "Blitz" weekly, Dulles, Kishida Nobusuke, and Mandres had planned to establish a Northeast Asian military bloc. Kazuo Yatsugi, a confidant of Kishida Nobusuke, recently intensified collusion with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group after visiting the Syngman Rhee group some time ago. There are reports that Kishida Nobusuke may visit South Korea.

### 泽田廉三暴露岸政府帝国主义野心  胆敢狂叫把“三八线”推到鸭绿江边

    泽田廉三暴露岸政府帝国主义野心
    胆敢狂叫把“三八线”推到鸭绿江边
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员今天在众议院外务委员会上，继续就出席“日韩会谈”的岸信介政府代表泽田廉三在朝鲜问题恳谈会上发表的帝国主义的战争叫嚣进行质询。这次质询暴露了岸信介政府的帝国主义野心。
    泽田廉三在6月11日在东京举行的朝鲜问题恳谈会上说，日本曾经在日清、日俄两次战役中在朝鲜半岛上打败了对手。今天，岸信介政府的外交任务是把目前的三八分界线推进到鸭绿江边。泽田当时还对在座的前朝鲜总督府政务总监田中武雄等过去侵略和统治过朝鲜人民的凶犯们表示，日本要第三次去朝鲜，这比目前的“日韩谈判”还要有意义。
    泽田廉三的这段话令人想起了“明治维新”后日本帝国主义的侵略政策：欲征服世界必先征服中国，欲征服中国必先征服东北，欲征服东北必先征服朝鲜。在这项政策的指导下，日本终于在1910年吞并了朝鲜，随后又逐渐侵入东北、侵略中国、以至在1941年发动了侵略整个东亚的太平洋战争。
    社会党议员大西正道和田中稔男今天质问泽田廉三说：他说要把目前的三八分界线推进到鸭绿江边是什么意思？说朝鲜目前的情况威胁日本的安全是什么意思？泽田在答复中虽然力图掩饰，但是，他的回答进一步暴露了岸信介政府的帝国主义面目，他说，由于所谓“共产主义势力威胁日本的安全”，他想“设法使朝鲜求得统一”。
    岸信介政府的帝国主义企图在这一时期越来越明显。为了想重新成为“亚洲盟主”，它在拼凑东北亚军事集团问题上正积极进行活动。据印度“闪电”周报驻东京记者揭露，杜勒斯、岸信介和曼德列斯曾经策划建立东北亚军事集团。岸信介的亲信矢次一夫在不久前访问了李承晚集团后最近又同台湾蒋介石集团加紧勾结。有消息说，岸信介可能访问南朝鲜。
