Implementing the General Line, Defending the Realization of the General Line
PLA Troops Surge with Enthusiasm

    (Our report) The large-scale activities of the various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to publicize the general line of socialist construction have been fully launched. Its characteristics are: great momentum, rapid development, diverse forms, vigorous and enthusiastic, gradually achieving that everyone studies the general line, everyone publicizes the general line, and everything implements the general line.

    The PLA's large-scale campaign to publicize the general line set off a surge shortly after the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. Sailors patrolling and training at sea on the Fujian front launched activities to study the general line on gunboats. The leading organs of the garrisons in Beijing, Jinan, Chengdu and other places stipulated June as the General Line Propaganda Month, organized a large number of reporters, and went deep into various grassroots units to conduct universal propaganda to the vast number of officers, soldiers, workers, families, and domestic helpers, ensuring that no one was left out. As of June 3, officers and soldiers of the Fujian front, with the exception of troops stationed on islands and the front line, had generally heard the report on the transmission of the general line. The troops stationed in Nanjing dispatched a propaganda army of tens of thousands on the 4th and 5th, with generals and colonels as the basic backbone, going deep into the grassroots to explain the general line to the soldiers in simple terms. The propaganda army of more than 400 people organized by the leading organs of the land and navy stationed in Zhoushan is currently going deep into various islands and companies to conduct propaganda.

    In the propaganda activities, the troops made full use of a variety of propaganda tools such as wired broadcasting, cultural troupes, clubs, newspapers, and movies, making this propaganda lively, vivid, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The Fuzhou Military Region Cultural Troupe worked hard for two days and nights to create fifty-three programs publicizing the general line, and went to the troops to perform separately. The Vanguard Cultural Troupe of the Jinan Military Region conducted propaganda to more than 10,000 people in the People's Park, railway station, and department store in Jinan.

    The PLA's vigorous publicity of the general line has achieved good results. The slogan "Vigorously implement the general line and resolutely defend the realization of the general line" has become the common determination of all officers and soldiers. Many units and individuals have revised their work plans and personal red-expert plans in accordance with the spirit of the general line. Some have proposed to be "six-good" soldiers, and some have proposed to become "six-good" units. The officers and soldiers of a certain all-round artillery division proposed to implement the general line with practical actions to create a "dual-ability division" (technical experts, all-round artillerymen). After listening to the report on the general line, thirty-two cadres of a certain unit submitted a letter of determination to the Party committee, expressing their determination to throw away the ideological baggage of individualism, move forward lightly, and keep up with the leap forward situation in the socialist construction of the motherland. Railway soldiers who are building railways across the country have extensively carried out technical innovation movements in the activities of striving to complete various road construction projects ahead of schedule with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and advanced deeds of improving technology, modifying tools, and improving labor productivity have continued to emerge. By the end of last month, nine units had completed nine engineering tasks ahead of schedule according to the original plan. Under the encouragement of the general line, the construction efficiency of a certain engineering corps company under construction has rapidly increased by more than one time.

    贯彻总路线　保卫总路线的实现
    解放军各部队干劲冲天
    本报讯　中国人民解放军各军种、各兵种部队大张旗鼓宣传社会主义建设总路线的活动，已经全面展开。它的特点是：声势大，发展快，形式多样，轰轰烈烈，逐步作到人人学习总路线，大家宣传总路线，事事贯彻总路线。
    解放军各部队大规模宣传总路线的活动，在党的八大二次会议闭幕后不久就掀起了热潮。正在福建前线海上进行巡逻、训练的水兵们，在炮艇上就展开了学习总路线的活动。北京、济南、成都等地驻军领导机关规定6月份为总路线宣传月，组织了大批报告员，深入到各基层单位，向广大官兵、职工、家属和保姆进行普遍宣传，作到一人不漏。截至6月3日止，福建前线部队除驻海岛和前沿一线部队外，官兵们已经普遍听到了关于总路线的传达报告。驻南京部队在4、5两日出动了上万名以将军和校官为基本骨干的宣传大军，深入基层向士兵通俗讲解总路线。驻舟山的陆、海军领导机关组织的四百多人的宣传大军，目前正深入各岛屿和连队进行宣传。
    在宣传活动中，各部队充分利用了有线广播、文工团、俱乐部、报刊、电影等多种多样的宣传工具，使这一宣传生动活泼，深入人心。福州部队文工团苦战两昼夜，创作了五十三个宣传总路线的节目，分头到部队进行演出。驻济南部队前卫文工团在济南市人民公园、火车站、百货大楼等地，向一万多群众进行了宣传。
    解放军各部队大力宣传总路线已经收到良好效果。“大力贯彻总路线、坚决保卫总路线的实现”的口号，已成为全军官兵的共同决心。许多单位和个人都根据总路线的精神，重新修订了工作规划和个人红专规划，有的提出要当“六好”战士，有的提出要成为“六好”单位。某全能炮手师的官兵提出要以创造“双能师”（技术能手、全能炮手）的实际行动，贯彻执行总路线。某部三十二个干部听了总路线的报告后，向党委呈递了决心书，表示决心扔掉个人主义思想包袱，轻装前进，跟上祖国社会主义建设事业的跃进形势。正在全国各地修筑铁路的铁道兵官兵在争取多快好省地提前完成各项筑路工程的活动中，广泛地开展了技术革新运动，并不断出现改进技术、改制工具和提高劳动生产率的先进事迹。到上月底止，已有九个单位按原计划提前完成了九项工程任务。正在施工的工程兵某连，在总路线的鼓舞下，工程作业时效迅速提高了一倍多。
