　　Wheat New Variety Creator
    Soviet Scientist Academician Tsitsin
    In 1903, in the Saratov region during the Tsarist era, a washerwoman tearfully sent her five-year-old child, whom she could not afford to raise, to a nursing home. At that time, no one would have imagined that more than fifty years later, this child, after a long journey as a worker, telegraph operator, and Red Army soldier, would climb the peaks of science and become one of the pioneers of humanity in "extracting" wealth from nature. He is Academician Tsitsin, the internationally renowned creator of new wheat varieties.
    Tsitsin was born in 1898 in Saratov to a carpenter's family. He developed a strong character from an early age. The only method of education in the nursing home he entered was merciless beatings. He escaped three times, but was caught and beaten each time.
    At the age of thirteen, Tsitsin began to support himself independently. His first job was as a worker in a handicraft workshop, and later he became a telegraph operator, with no opportunity for education at all. After the October Revolution, he joined the Red Army and participated in the war against foreign invaders and the bourgeois landlord White Guards. In 1923, the Party sent him to study at the Saratov Agricultural Institute. Initially, he studied preparatory courses for workers entering university, overcoming various difficulties.
    In 1926, Tsitsin and a group of classmates from the Agricultural Institute visited the world-renowned botanist Michurin. The words of this great scientist ignited Tsitsin's creative enthusiasm. He said, "We cannot wait for the gifts of nature, but must extract them from nature." Michurin's words about researching new avenues for wheat were particularly inspiring to Tsitsin.
    In 1927, after graduating from the Agricultural Institute, Tsitsin went to work at a grain research institute and began his tenacious experiments to transform wheat.
    Humans have been planting wheat for more than four thousand five hundred years, but at that time, a perfect wheat variety had not yet been obtained. In Tsitsin's eyes, the existing wheat was like a coward, unable to withstand cold, heat, or drought; requiring fertile soil, yet powerless to resist the invasion of bacteria such as bunt and wheat rust. Tsitsin was determined to cultivate a new wheat variety that would break free from this fragile state.
    Inspired by Michurin, Tsitsin did not use the common method of hybridizing different wheat varieties, but instead took a bold approach: crossing wheat with a very resilient weed called "couch grass." In the experiment, he suffered many failures, but he was not discouraged. He finally cultivated many new wheat varieties with strong characteristics. The character of wheat changed. Among them were cold-resistant, high-yielding winter wheat, new types of spring wheat, and particularly noteworthy was a perennial wheat, a new creation in the plant kingdom. The wheat it produced was of good quality, and after each harvest, it could regrow like thatch.
    Later, Tsitsin also used a plant called "sand wheat" to cross with barley, wheat, rye, and other plants. The new wheat varieties cultivated produced more than a thousand grains per ear, with yields as high as two thousand catties per mu (Chinese acre).
    Due to his outstanding contributions to agriculture, Tsitsin served as the Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1938, was elected as an Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1939, and received the Stalin Prize in 1943. He was also awarded the Order of Lenin four times, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and other medals.

### 小麦新品种创造者  苏联科学家齐津院士

　　小麦新品种创造者
    苏联科学家齐津院士
    1903年，在沙俄时代萨拉托夫地方，一个洗衣妇含着泪水把自己养活不了的一个五岁的孩子送进了养育院。当时，谁也没有想到，五十多年后，这个孩子经过当工人、电报员、红军等漫长的道路，一直攀登科学的高峰，成了人类“向自然索取”财富的先锋之一。他就是国际知名的小麦新品种创造者齐津院士。
    1898年，齐津生于萨拉托夫一个木匠家里。从小就养成了坚强的性格。他所进的养育院唯一的教育方法是无情的鞭打。他曾三次逃跑，但三次都被抓回来，遭受鞭打。
    十三岁的时候，齐津便开始独立谋生。他的第一个职业是手工业作坊工人，后来当了电报员，根本没有受教育的机会。十月革命后，他参加了红军，参加了反对外国侵略者和资产阶级地主白卫势力的战争。1923年，党送他到萨拉托夫农业学院学习。开始时，他学着工人进大学的预备课程，克服了种种困难。
    1926年，齐津和农业学院的一群同学去访问世界闻名的植物学家米丘林。这位伟大的科学家的话激起了齐津的创造热情。他说，“我们不能等待自然的恩赐，而是要向自然索取。”米丘林关于研究小麦新途径的话对齐津特别有启发。
    1927年，齐津从农业学院毕业后就到一个谷物研究所工作，开始了他改造小麦的顽强的试验。
    人类种小麦已有四千五百多年的历史了，但当时，仍未获得一种完善的麦种。在齐津眼里看来，已有的小麦像个懦夫，它既不能耐寒，又不能忍受热和干旱；既需要肥美的土壤，又无力抵抗黑穗病和麦锈病等细菌的侵袭。齐津决心要培育出一种摆脱这种娇弱状态的新麦种。
    齐津得到米丘林的启示，不是用一般采取的使不同麦种杂交的方法，而是采取了一个大胆方法进行试验：用一种生命力极强的野草“蔓野麦”来与小麦交配。在试验中，他遭到多次失败，但他不灰心，终于培育出许多种性格坚强的新麦种，小麦的性格变了，它们中间有能耐寒、产量高的冬麦，有新种春麦，特别引人注意的是一种多年生的小麦，它是植物界的新创造。它出产的麦子质量很好，每次收割之后，像茅草一样能重新生长起来。
    后来，齐津还用一种叫“砂麦”的植物和大麦、小麦、黑麦等交配，培育出来的新麦种，每穗结的麦粒竟达一千多粒，每市亩产量高达二千市斤。
    由于他在农业方面的卓越贡献，齐津在1938年担任苏联农业科学院副院长，1939年被选为苏联科学院院士，1943年获得斯大林奖金，此后还四次得到列宁勋章、劳动红旗勋章和其他奖章。
