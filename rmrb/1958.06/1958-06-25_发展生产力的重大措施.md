    Major Measures for Developing Productivity
  Transferring the management of most of the enterprises, institutions, and technical forces originally managed by the central departments to the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions is a major reform in China's economic management system and a major measure for implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and developing productivity.
    The devolution of management authority over enterprises, institutions, and technical forces is determined based on the principle of combining centralism and localism. Our country is a socialist country. In our country, implementing the combination of centralism and localism means implementing democratic centralism, giving play to the initiative of localities and the people under the unified leadership of the central government, and developing social productive forces faster and better. In the past few years, in terms of industrial and financial management systems, there was more centralization. Almost all large and medium-sized enterprises, institutions, and major technical forces were directly managed by the central departments. This was also determined by the objective conditions at the time. During the three years of the recovery period, the entire national economy had not yet returned to normal, and everything was waiting to be done. Without more centralization, the national economy could not be quickly restored. When entering the first five-year plan, we also lacked experience. Without more centralization, we could not guarantee the smooth progress of construction. Looking at it now, the past concentration was necessary and correct, but there were also some shortcomings. That is, the central departments managed some specific work of enterprises and institutions too much, and the initiative and enthusiasm of localities and enterprises were not fully developed. Our country is a large country. The area of a province is larger than some European countries, and the population is larger than that of some countries. The economic development of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions is also very uneven. Some have relatively developed industries, while others are relatively backward. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to manage well by attempting to manage enterprises across the country in one format. In particular, the economic situation of our country has undergone great changes in the past nine years. More and more new factories and mines are being built, old industrial bases are constantly expanding, and new industrial bases are emerging. It is practically difficult for these factories and mines to be directly managed by the central departments. Even if they are managed reluctantly, it is difficult to provide specific leadership to each enterprise. Under such circumstances, the original industrial management system must be appropriately changed to further develop productivity.
    As early as April 1956, in his report on "Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the need to correctly resolve the combination of centralism and localism, pointing out that localities should be allowed to handle more affairs so that the construction work in all aspects of the country can develop more, faster, better, and more economically, and that the central departments can concentrate their efforts on handling the things that they should be responsible for handling. On November 15, 1957, the State Council, based on this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, promulgated the regulations on improving the industrial management system. On April 11 this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly made several decisions on the devolution of industrial enterprises, that is, the management rights of state-owned enterprises, except for a few special and experimental units, will be gradually delegated to provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The devolution of enterprise management rights will be more conducive to the combination of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises and the implementation of the principle of the whole party running industry and the whole people running industry, and will be more conducive to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, more than 180 special districts and autonomous prefectures, more than 2,000 counties and autonomous counties, more than 80,000 townships and towns, more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives, and more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives to run industry, and to accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country.
    After the devolution of enterprise management rights, the production potential of enterprises may be fully tapped. Because after the devolution of management rights, the relationship between the locality and the enterprise changes from indirect to direct, and the profits and losses of the enterprise directly affect the local government's financial income and directly affect the development of local economic and cultural undertakings. This makes the locality more concerned about the production and construction of enterprises, and more actively trying every means to develop the productive forces of enterprises. The construction of Mingshan Reservoir in Hubei Province is a prominent example. The scale of this reservoir project is slightly smaller than that of Guanting Reservoir. When the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power approved this project last year, it was feared that an investment of 18.16 million yuan would not be enough. However, after the management right of the reservoir construction was devolved to Hubei Province last winter, an investment of only 9.3 million yuan was enough. One Mingshan Reservoir became two reservoirs. Why is this? The main reason is that the local party committees are better able than the central departments to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and run enterprises diligently and thriftily according to the specific conditions of the locality. For example, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, considering the enthusiasm of the migrant workers for repairing water conservancy, changed the earth and stone works of the irrigation branch canals to be self-managed by the masses, saving investment and using it to build other water conservancy projects, which the farmers were very satisfied with. At the same time, after the resettlement work of this reservoir was contracted by Macheng County, Macheng County mobilized the masses in the beneficiary area to move houses and build houses for the relocated households, helping the relocated households to settle down, which was economical, practical, and more effective. As for the construction of external roads and non-productive buildings of this reservoir, the investment was also greatly reduced because the enthusiasm of the local people and other favorable conditions were fully utilized. These are difficult for enterprises directly managed by the central government to achieve.
    In his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "With the improvement of the management system, with the leap forward in production and construction undertakings and the improvement of the masses' awareness, we must earnestly and systematically improve the current rules and regulations on economic work and other work." The rules and regulations of economic work are the superstructure that reflects the economic base and serves the economic base, and it must meet the needs of the development of productive forces. Many of the current rules and regulations of economic work in our country were formulated according to the previous management system. Now, according to the principle of combining centralism and localism, according to the policy of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, and relying on the masses, it is very necessary to comprehensively review the current rules and regulations once. Those that are reasonable and can promote production should be preserved; those that are unreasonable and unfavorable to the development of production should be revised or abolished, and rules and regulations suitable for the new situation and needs should be formulated. In this way, we can further adapt the superstructure to the economic base, adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces, and further promote the high tide of production and construction.
    The distribution of existing enterprises and institutions in our country is very uneven. Provinces and municipalities with very developed industries originally take over more units and technical forces, while provinces and autonomous regions with very underdeveloped industries originally take over fewer units and technical forces. Therefore, after the devolution of enterprises, institutions, and technical forces, enterprises, institutions, and local party committees and people's committees, in addition to ensuring the completion of the planned tasks stipulated by the central government, should also adhere to the principle of old factories supporting new factories, areas with strong industrial foundations supporting areas with weak industrial foundations, and units with strong technical forces supporting units with weak technical forces, continue to carry forward the spirit of communist cooperation, actively complete the original cooperative tasks, accept new cooperative tasks, and help those industrially underdeveloped provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and localities to rapidly build up local industries. In this regard, the slogan put forward by the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry, "We would rather take fewer equipment ourselves, but also help other provinces and cities to develop industry faster," is worthy of promotion. According to this slogan, they supply more than 80% of the mechanical equipment produced by local industries to other provinces and cities this year. This spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation should be greatly promoted.
    After the devolution of enterprise management rights, will the responsibilities of the central departments in socialist construction be reduced? From the perspective of managing the affairs of enterprises, it is reduced, but from the perspective of the tasks undertaken in socialist construction, it is not reduced, but increased. In addition to managing a few special and experimental enterprises and institutions, the central departments must also concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in overall planning and organizing national-level large-scale collaboration and large-scale balance. The central departments must also summarize and promote the advanced experiences of various places by conducting experimental plots and grasping a few key enterprises; they must organize the research and adoption of new technologies and do a good job in technical guidance and improvement. These tasks are much more complicated and arduous than the work of specifically managing enterprises. The central departments must continue to improve their work style and work methods on the basis of rectification, go deep into the grassroots, and maintain close contact with localities in order to complete their tasks.
    The devolution of management rights of enterprises and undertakings only creates conditions for the development of productive forces. Even the best conditions must be utilized by people to produce practical results. Now, all localities have accumulated a lot of experience in leading and managing enterprises, and the enthusiasm of the workers is high. As long as we earnestly rely on the masses, we believe that this major improvement in the management system will surely greatly promote the development of productive forces and greatly accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country.

    发展生产力的重大措施
  把大部分原来由中央各部门管理的企业、事业单位和技术力量下放给省、市、自治区管理，这是我国经济管理体制的一大改革，也是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，发展生产力的一个重大措施。
    企业、事业单位和技术力量的管理权下放，是根据中央集权和地方分权相结合的原则确定的。我们的国家是社会主义国家，在我们国家里，实行中央集权和地方分权相结合，就是贯彻民主集中制，就是在中央的统一领导下，发扬地方和人民的积极性，更快更好地发展社会生产力。过去几年在工业和财经的管理体制方面，集中得多一些，差不多全国所有的大型、中型企业、事业单位和主要的技术力量，都由中央各部门直接管理。这也是当时的客观条件所决定的。因为在三年的恢复时期，整个国民经济还没有走上正轨，百废待举，没有比较多的集中就不能迅速恢复国民经济；在进入第一个五年计划建设的时候，我们也还缺少经验，没有比较多的集中，也就不能保证建设事业的顺利进行。现在来看，过去的集中是必要的正确的，但是也有一些缺点。这就是中央各部门对企业、事业单位的一些具体工作有的管得多了一些，发扬地方和企业的积极性和主动性不够。我国是一个大国，一个省的面积比欧洲的某些国家还大，人口比某些国家的还多。各省、市、自治区的经济发展也很不平衡，有的工业比较发达，有的则比较落后。在这种情况下，企图用一个格式把全国企业管理起来，是很难管得好的。特别是九年来我们国家的经济情况已经起了很大的变化。新建的厂矿越来越多，旧的工业基地在不断扩大，新的工业基地在不断出现。这些厂矿都由中央各部门直接管理，事实上是有困难的，即使勉强管起来，也很难对每一个企业进行具体的领导。在这种情况下，原来的工业管理体制就必须有适当的改变，使生产力得到进一步的发展。
    早在1956年4月，毛泽东同志在关于“十大关系”的报告中，就提出了必须正确解决中央集权和地方分权相结合的问题，指出要让地方办更多的事情，使全国各方面的建设工作能够又多又快又好又省地发展，也使中央各部门能够集中力量去办那些应当由自己负责办好的事情。1957年11月15日，国务院根据毛泽东同志的这个指示，公布了关于改进工业管理体制的规定，今年4月11日，中共中央、国务院又共同作出了关于工业企业下放的几项决定，就是把国营企业的管理权，除少数特殊的和试验性的单位以外，都逐步下放给省、市和自治区。企业管理权的下放，将更有利于大型企业和中小型企业相结合和全党办工业、全民办工业的方针的贯彻，更有利于把全国二十几个省、市和自治区，一百八十多个专区和自治州，二千多个县和自治县，八万多个乡和镇，十万多个手工业合作社和七十多万个农业合作社办工业的积极性充分发挥起来，加快我国社会主义建设的速度。
    企业管理权下放以后，企业的生产潜力就有可能充分挖掘出来。因为管理权下放以后，地方跟企业的关系就由间接的变为直接的了，企业的盈亏直接影响着地方财政的收入，直接影响着地方经济和文化事业的发展。这就使地方更加关心企业的生产和建设，更加积极地千方百计地发展企业的生产力。湖北省明山水库的建设，就是一个显著的例子。这个水库工程的规模比官厅水库稍小一点。去年中央水利电力部批准这项工程的时候，投资一千八百一十六万元还怕不够，但是，去年冬天，水库建设的管理权下放给湖北省以后，投资只要九百三十多万元就够了。一个明山水库变成了两个水库。这是为什么呢？主要的原因，就是地方党委比中央各部门更能根据地方的具体情况，发动群众，依靠群众，勤俭办企业。例如湖北省水利厅考虑到民工修水利的积极性，将灌溉支渠的土石方工程改由群众自办，节省了投资，用以兴修其他水利工程，农民都很满意。同时，这个水库的移民工作由麻城县包干以后，麻城县就发动受益区群众为迁移户搬家盖房，帮助迁移户安家，经济实用，效果更好。至于这个水库在修建对外公路和非生产性建筑方面，也都因为充分利用了当地群众的积极性和其他有利条件，投资也大大减少。这些都是中央直接管理的企业难于做到的。
    刘少奇同志在向“八大”二次会议的工作报告中指出：“随着管理体制的改进，随着生产建设事业的跃进和群众觉悟的提高，必须认真地、有系统地改进现行的关于经济工作以及其他工作的各种规章制度。”经济工作的规章制度是反映经济基础并为经济基础服务的上层建筑，它必须适应生产力发展的需要。我国现行的经济工作的各种规章制度，不少是根据以前的管理体制制订的。现在根据中央集权和地方分权相结合的原则，根据多快好省地建设社会主义的方针，依靠群众，全面审查一次现行的规章制度，十分必要。对其中合理的能够促进生产的部分，应当保存；对不合理的不利于发展生产的部分，应当进行修改或取消，制订适合于新情况和需要的规章制度。这样，我们才能使上层建筑进一步适应于经济基础，适应生产力发展的需要，更加推动生产建设的高潮。
    我国现有的企业和事业单位的分布很不均衡，原来工业很发达的省、市接管的单位和技术力量要多一些，原来工业很不发达的省、自治区接管的单位和技术力量则少一些。因此，在企业、事业单位和技术力量下放以后，企业、事业单位和地方党委、人民委员会，除了保证完成中央规定的计划任务以外，还应该本着老厂支援新厂、工业基础强的地区支援工业基础弱的地区、技术力量强的单位支援技术力量弱的单位的原则，继续发扬共产主义的协作精神，积极完成原来的协作任务，接受新的协作任务，帮助那些工业不发达的省、市、自治区和地方，迅速地把地方工业建设起来。在这一方面，辽宁省工业厅提出的“宁愿自己少拿些设备，也要帮助别的省市快点发展工业”的口号是值得推广的。根据这个口号，他们今年把80％以上的地方工业生产的机械设备供给别的省市。这种互助协作的精神，应当大大发扬。
    企业管理权下放以后，是不是中央各部门在社会主义建设中的责任就减轻了呢？从对企业的管理事务来说，是减轻了，但是，从在社会主义建设中所负担的任务来说，不是减轻了，而是加重了。中央各部门除了管理好少数特殊的和试验性的企业、事业单位以外，还要集中力量做好全面规划，组织全国大协作、大平衡的工作。中央各部门还要通过搞试验田的办法，抓几个重点企业，总结和推广各地的先进经验；要组织对新技术的研究和采用，做好技术指导和提高的工作。这些工作比起具体管理企业的工作来要复杂得多和繁重得多。中央各部门必须在整风的基础上继续改进工作作风，改进工作方法，深入基层，跟地方密切联系，才能完成自己的任务。
    企业和事业的管理权下放，仅仅是为生产力的发展创造了条件。再好的条件，也必须经过人们的利用才能生出实际的效果来。现在，各地方都积累了很多的领导和管理企业的经验，职工群众的干劲十足，只要认真依靠群众，我们相信，管理体制的这一重大改进一定能大大地促进生产力的发展，大大地加快我国社会主义建设的速度。
