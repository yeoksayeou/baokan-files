Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Moscow Dispatch: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev wrote a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower on June 11th, requesting the United States and other relevant Western countries to immediately indicate whether they sincerely hope to convene a summit meeting.

In the letter, Khrushchev said that the current situation in the preparation for the summit is: "Stagnant," and "in some issues, it is even regressing in substance." He pointed out that many people are asking whether the Western countries' proposal to hold preparatory talks through diplomatic channels is intended to create more difficulties on the road to convening a summit.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Western countries' suggestions regarding the agenda of the summit and other documents submitted to the Soviet Union by these countries have caused the Soviet Union to have serious doubts on this issue. He said that the drafters of these documents do not hope to find solutions that are most acceptable to all parties, but rather put forward issues for which the conditions for resolution are not yet ripe, "so that they can then declare that their predictions about the failure of the heads of government talks are correct."

When mentioning the issues that the Soviet government believes should be discussed at the summit, Khrushchev pointed out that there are now many people who dare to deny that reaching agreements on these issues is in the vital interests of every country and every country's people.

Khrushchev emphatically stressed, "If the Western countries are not prepared to resolve all the issues submitted by the Soviet government for discussion at the meeting now, then some issues can be selected from them and agreements can be reached on these issues, which will help us continue to move forward on the road to strengthening peace in the future."

However, in the documents of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France responding to the Soviet government's proposal of May 5th, those issues that do not increase the possibility of reaching an agreement but reduce this possibility were raised again.

Khrushchev refuted the new attempts by Western countries to force a discussion on the so-called situation in Eastern European countries. Khrushchev said that there is no object of discussion here. He emphasized, "Insisting on interfering in the affairs of other countries, insisting on third-party countries that do not have any such rights discussing their internal affairs, means embarking on the road of seriously undermining the United Nations Charter which prohibits such interference, and means mocking the principles of the United Nations." Khrushchev believes that the Western countries' position on this issue proves that they intend to bury the heads of government meeting in its embryonic state.

Khrushchev also refuted the practice of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France insisting on discussing the issue of German reunification at the summit. He pointed out that this issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of international conferences. The reunification of Germany can only be the result of the joint efforts of the two sovereign states currently existing on German territory.

Khrushchev said that the intention of the Western countries' proposals on European security issues is nothing more than: wanting to drag the whole of Germany into their military bloc, wanting to comfort the people of Europe with verbal "guarantees." He emphasized that if we consider that the country occupying a leading position in the North Atlantic military bloc assumes the role of "guarantor," then the contrived nature of the proposal to provide "guarantees" to the Soviet Union becomes very obvious.

Khrushchev emphasized that the current task is: to establish a situation that will no longer make Europe a battlefield for a new war. He said that the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the members of the North Atlantic Alliance will bring a much-needed element of stability and reassurance to the entire international situation.

When talking about the suggestions made by Western countries on the issue of disarmament, Khrushchev expressed that it is also doubtful whether they raised these issues in the way Western countries raise them in order to truly reach a unanimous agreement on these issues. He said that the Soviet Union has always advocated a thorough solution to the disarmament issue in the past and now, but the Western countries have not expressed their willingness to reach an agreement on a universal disarmament plan. The Soviet Union has proposed the only realistic path—first proposing and resolving those issues for which the conditions for resolution are already ripe, and then starting to resolve some of the most complex issues.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government wants to know clearly whether the Western governments truly intend to hold a summit, or whether they want to give the people the impression that contact has been established and negotiations are underway, while in fact they are raising issues that will not only undermine the preparations for the meeting but also prevent the summit from being held.

Identical letters have been sent to British Prime Minister Macmillan and French Prime Minister de Gaulle.

Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Moscow Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko successively received the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Union on the 16th, and discussed the issue of the highest-level meeting with them separately.

### 是否真诚愿意召开最高级会议  赫鲁晓夫促西方国家表明态度

    是否真诚愿意召开最高级会议
    赫鲁晓夫促西方国家表明态度
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在11日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，要求美国和西方其他有关国家立即表明它们是否真诚希望召开最高级会议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信里说：在高级会议的准备工作中，目前的情况是：
  “停滞不前”，而“在一些问题上实质上甚至是倒退了”。他指出，许多人在问：西方国家关于通过外交途径举行预备会谈的建议是不是想在召开最高级会议的道路上制造更多的困难。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西方国家关于高级会议议程的建议和这些国家交给苏联的其他文件使苏联对这个问题产生了严重的怀疑，他说：这些文件的起草人并不希望找寻各方最能接受的解决问题的办法，而是提出了那些解决条件尚未成熟的问题，“以便他们随后有可能声明，他们关于政府首脑会谈不会成功的预言是对的。”
    赫鲁晓夫在提到苏联政府认为应当在高级会议上讨论的那些问题时指出，现在有不少这样的人，他们竟敢否认，在这些问题上达成协议是符合每个国家、每个国家人民的切身利益的。
    赫鲁晓夫十分肯定地强调说，“如果西方国家现在不准备解决苏联政府提交会议讨论的全部问题，那么可以从中选择一些问题并且就这些问题达成协议，这将有助于我们以后在加强和平的道路上继续前进”。
    但是，在美、英、法三国政府回答5月5日苏联政府建议的文件中，重新又提出了那些不是使达成协议的可能性增加而是使这种可能性减少的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了西方国家强要讨论所谓东欧国家局势问题的新企图。赫鲁晓夫说，这里没有讨论的对象。他强调指出，“坚持干涉其他国家事务，坚持由没有任何这种权利的第三者国家讨论它们的内政，这就意味着走上严重破坏禁止这种干涉的联合国宪章的道路，意味着嘲弄联合国的原则”。赫鲁晓夫认为，西方国家在这个问题上的立场证明，它们打算在萌芽状态就把政府首脑会议埋葬。
    赫鲁晓夫同时也驳斥了美、英、法三国政府硬要在高级会议上讨论统一德国问题的做法，他指出，这个问题不属于国际会议的权限之内。德国的统一只能是目前在德国领土存在的两个主权国家共同努力的结果。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家关于欧洲安全问题的建议的用意不外是：想把整个德国拖进他们的军事集团，想用口头的“保证”来宽慰欧洲人民。他强调指出，如果考虑到，在北大西洋军事集团中居领导地位的国家承担“保证人”的角色，那么关于向苏联提供“保证”的建议的做作性质就很明显了。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，现在的任务是：建立一种不会再使欧洲成为新战争的战场的局面。他说，缔结华沙条约缔约国和北大西洋联盟成员国的互不侵犯公约将可以给整个国际局势带来十分必要的稳定与安定人心的因素。
    在谈到西方国家就有关裁军的问题所提出的建议时，赫鲁晓夫表示，按西方国家提问题的方式来看，它们提出这些问题是否是为了想真正就这些问题取得一致同意的解决，也是令人怀疑的。他说，苏联在过去和现在都一直主张彻底解决裁军问题，但是西方国家没有表示愿意就普遍裁军计划达成协议。苏联提出一条唯一现实的道路——首先提出和解决那些解决条件已经成熟的问题，然后再着手解决一些最复杂的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府想明确地知道，西方国家政府是真正打算举行高级会议呢，还是想给人民造成一种接触已经建立谈判正在进行的印象，而事实上却提出一些不仅会破坏会议的筹备工作而且会使高级会议不能举行的问题。
    内容相同的信件已送给英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯16日先后接见了美国、英国和法国驻苏联的大使，分别同他们谈了有关最高级会议的问题。
