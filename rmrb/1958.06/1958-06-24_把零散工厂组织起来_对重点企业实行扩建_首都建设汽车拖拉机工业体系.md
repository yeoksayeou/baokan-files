Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The construction of an automobile and tractor industrial system has begun in the capital and will be rapidly completed in a relatively short period.

The construction of this industrial system in the capital is being carried out under the guidance of the principles of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor, and cooperation. It involves organizing scattered factories for automobile repair, assembly, accessory manufacturing, and parts manufacturing, and expanding key enterprises appropriately on the basis of fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises and the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, thereby forming this modern industrial system.

According to the preliminary plan proposed by the special team designated by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this industrial system will be rapidly formed on the basis of existing enterprises in the following seven areas: First, build the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, with an annual output of tens of thousands of vehicles, based on factories such as the First Automobile Accessory Factory; Second, build a factory producing tens of thousands of tractors and combine harvesters annually, based on factories such as the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory; Third, establish a motorcycle manufacturing plant on the basis of the Handicraft Production Cooperative Motorcycle Factory; Fourth, establish a bus assembly plant on the basis of the trolleybus factory; Fifth, build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant based on factories such as the Transportation Bureau Repair Factory; Sixth, build more than ten specialized factories, such as accessory factories, gear factories, spring factories, electrical appliance factories, instrument factories, tire factories, plastic factories, seat cushion factories, vehicle tool factories, paint factories, and lock factories, on the basis of several existing state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private enterprises, and handicraft production cooperatives with similar characteristics; Seventh, better organize other repair factories and repair stations distributed throughout the city to meet the scattered and large-scale repair needs of industry and citizens. In this way, except for the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Agricultural Machinery Factory, which need to be significantly expanded, the remaining manufacturing plants and specialized factories only need to be slightly expanded and reorganized from the existing factories to be quickly built, which greatly saves the country's investment and wins the speed of construction, shortening the time for construction, trial production, and commissioning.

After the establishment of this system, it will not only mechanize transportation in the capital and agricultural mechanization in the suburbs, but also strongly support the whole country.

At present, this preliminary plan is being implemented and further studied and revised. Among them, the automobile and tractor production collaboration system has been initially formed, and the expansion projects of the automobile manufacturing plant and the tractor manufacturing plant are proceeding rapidly. With the successful trial production of the Hongqi brand universal chassis tractor, the universal tractor, the Julong brand tractor, and the Jinggangshan brand sedan, the automobile and tractor manufacturing in the capital will shift to mass production within a few months, and within two or three years it can grow into an automobile and tractor manufacturing center with an annual output of tens of thousands of vehicles.

In the past, Beijing only had an automobile accessory factory, an agricultural machinery factory, and some scattered automobile repair and assembly factories. In this year's Great Leap Forward in production, in view of the urgent need for large-scale production of automobiles and tractors in the capital, the broad masses of workers dared to think and act, and did what they said they would do. Eight factories simultaneously began trial production of automobiles and tractors, and repeatedly advanced the scheduled deadline for successful trial production.

Under the circumstances of urgent national needs, possible objective conditions, and unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the workers, how to shift from trial production to mass production has become an urgent problem for the development of the automobile and tractor industry in the capital. Now there are three methods that can be adopted in Beijing: One way is to build large-scale automobile factories and tractor manufacturing plants, but this requires an investment of several hundred million yuan and a construction period of several years. Another way is to let the factories currently engaged in trial production develop independently; but these factories can still carry out sample trial production and small-batch production, but they will encounter many difficulties such as funds, equipment, and technical strength if they switch to large-scale production, and because of the dispersed forces, the time for mass production will be delayed. After studying the needs of the country and the city's industrial production capacity, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to adopt the third method, that is, what is currently being implemented, under the guidance of the "centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor, and cooperation" policy, to organize the relevant old factories to implement comprehensive cooperation, while carrying out production, while carrying out reorganization and expansion, in order to rapidly develop the capital's automobile manufacturing industry and tractor manufacturing industry.

### 把零散工厂组织起来  对重点企业实行扩建  首都建设汽车拖拉机工业体系

    把零散工厂组织起来  对重点企业实行扩建
    首都建设汽车拖拉机工业体系
    新华社23日讯  一个汽车、拖拉机工业体系的建设已开始在首都进行，并且将在较短的时期内迅速完成。
    首都建设这种工业体系，是在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作方针的指导下，把一些零散的汽车修理、装配、附件制造和配件制造等工厂组织起来，在充分发挥旧有企业潜力和职工群众积极性和创造性的基础上，加以适当的重点扩建，从而组成这种现代化工业的体系。
    按照中共北京市委指定的专门小组提出的初步规划方案，这种工业体系将在下列七个方面的现有企业的基础上迅速组成：一、以第一汽车附件厂等工厂为基础，建成一个年产几万辆汽车的北京汽车制造厂；二、以北京农业机械厂等工厂为基础，建成一个年产几万辆拖拉机和联合收割机的工厂；三、在手工业生产合作社摩托车厂的基础上建立一个摩托车制造厂；四、在无轨电车厂的基础上建立一个公共汽车的装配厂；五、以运输局修理厂等工厂为基础建成电瓶车制造厂；六、在现有若干性质相近的国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂和手工业生产合作社的基础上，建成附件厂、齿轮厂、弹簧厂、电器厂、仪表厂、轮胎厂、塑料厂、座垫厂、随车工具厂、油漆厂、锁厂等十多个专业性的工厂；七、把分布在全市的其他修理厂、修理站更好地组织起来，以适应工业和市民零星的和大量的修理的需要。这样，除北京汽车制造厂和农业机械厂要进行较大的扩建外，其余的制造厂、专业厂只须在现有若干工厂中略加扩建和改组就可迅速建成，这就大大节约了国家的投资，并且争得了建设的速度，缩短了建设、试制和投入生产的时间。
    这个体系建立后，不但要使首都运输机械化、郊区农业机械化，还将有力地支援全国。
    现在，这个初步规划方案正在一面实施，一面在进一步研究和修正。其中汽车和拖拉机生产协作体系已经初步形成，汽车制造厂和拖拉机制造厂的扩建工程正在迅速进行。随着红旗牌万能底盘拖拉机、万能拖拉机、巨龙牌拖拉机和井冈山牌小轿车的试制成功，首都的汽车、拖拉机制造将在几个月内转入成批生产，两三年内就可以生长为一个年产几万辆以上的汽车拖拉机制造中心。
    北京过去只有一个汽车附件厂、一个农业机械厂和一些零散的汽车修理装配工厂。在今年的生产大跃进中，鉴于首都有大量生产汽车、拖拉机的迫切需要，广大职工群众敢想敢干，说干就干，有八个工厂同时开始试制汽车和拖拉机，并且把试制成功的预定期限一再提前。
    在这种国家迫切需要、客观条件可能和职工群众积极性空前高涨的情况下，怎样由试制转入成批生产，就成为首都发展汽车、拖拉机工业的一个迫切问题。现在在北京有三种办法可以采取：一种办法是新建大型的汽车厂和拖拉机制造厂，但这需要几亿元的投资，几年的建设期限。另一种办法是让现在搞试制的各厂各自独立发展；但这些工厂搞样品试制和小批生产还可以，要转入大量的生产就会碰到资金、设备、技术力量等很多困难，而且由于力量分散，会把成批生产的时间推迟。中共北京市委研究了国家的需要和全市的工业生产能力之后，决定采取第三种办法，即现在所实行的，在“集中领导，全面规划，分工协作”方针的指导下，把有关的旧厂组织起来实行全面协作，一面进行生产，一面进行改组和扩建，以迅速地发展首都的汽车制造工业和拖拉机制造工业。
