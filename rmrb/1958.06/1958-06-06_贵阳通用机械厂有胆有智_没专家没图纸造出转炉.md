Guiyang General Machinery Factory: Bold and Intelligent
Built Converter Without Experts or Blueprints

    (Our report) According to the Guizhou Daily, the Guiyang General Machinery Factory has manufactured Guizhou Province's first steelmaking converter. On the 22nd, the Guiyang Foundry used this converter for a steelmaking test, and the results proved it met the standards of a typical converter.

    A converter is a type of steelmaking furnace with a simple furnace body. The entire smelting process does not require any fuel; instead, it relies on air blowing. Therefore, the cost per ton of steel can be about 50% lower than open-hearth steelmaking. Converters can not only produce steel needed for construction and agricultural tool manufacturing but also produce high-quality steel.

    In April of this year, when the employees of the General Machinery Factory were studying how to trial-produce a converter, some technicians were not very confident, believing that it would be difficult to manufacture a converter in a factory without professional engineers. However, the workers believed they could definitely manufacture the converter. Subsequently, they calculated the number of machine tools available and assigned tasks. The design work of the converter was the responsibility of Zhao Juchuan, head of the General Factory's production section, and Bian Guozhang, a technician from the Foundry. Without formal converter blueprints, they referred to an incomplete schematic diagram from the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant in 1955 and, together with the workers, made more than twenty revisions. With the support and encouragement of the two factory Party committees, all employees worked hard for twenty-five days and finally succeeded in trial-producing the converter.

    贵阳通用机械厂有胆有智
    没专家没图纸造出转炉
    本报讯　据贵州日报报道：贵阳通用机械厂制出了贵州省第一座炼钢转炉。22日，贵阳翻砂厂用这座转炉进行炼钢试验的结果，证明合乎一般转炉标准。
    转炉是炼钢炉的一种，炉身构造简单，整个冶炼过程不需要加任何燃料，而是靠空气吹炼。因此，每吨钢的费用可比平炉炼钢低50％左右。转炉不仅能生产建筑和制造农具所需要的钢，还能生产优质钢。
    今年4月份，通用机械厂职工研究，如何试制转炉的时候，有的技术人员表现信心不高，认为在一个没有专业工程师的厂子里，要制造出转炉来是困难的。但是，工人们认为一定能够制造出转炉来。接着，他们算了车床账，进行了分工。转炉的设计工作，是由通用厂生产科长赵巨川和翻砂厂技术员卞国璋负责搞的，没有正式的转炉图纸，他们就参照昆明钢铁厂1955年的一张不完整的示意图，和工人们一道，经过二十多次的修改，在两个厂党委的支持与鼓励下，全体职工苦战二十五天，终于试制成功了。
