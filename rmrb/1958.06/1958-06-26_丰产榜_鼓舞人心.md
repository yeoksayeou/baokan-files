    "Bumper Harvest榜" Inspires People
    The People's Daily's practice of publishing the agricultural cooperatives with wheat yields of over 1,000 catties per mu on the "Bumper Harvest榜" is excellent. It gives people great inspiration and encouragement. The facts tell people that yields of over 1,000 catties per mu are no longer isolated phenomena. Judging solely from the "Bumper Harvest榜" in the People's Daily from June 12th to June 18th, more than forty cooperatives have already achieved wheat yields of over 1,000 catties per mu, exceeding the number of cooperatives achieving 1,000 catties nationally in 1957 several times over. (Editor's note: The 1957 figure for cooperatives with 1,000 catties mentioned in the People's Daily's "Brief Information" on June 12th is an incomplete statistic.) Shandong Sheng Qizhang

    “丰产榜”鼓舞人心
    人民日报把今年小麦亩产千斤以上的农业社登在“丰产榜”上，这样做法非常好。它给人们一个很大的启发和鼓舞。事实告诉人们亩产千斤以上的已不是个别的现象了。仅从人民日报6月12日到6月18日的“丰产榜”上计算，已有四十多个社小麦亩产千斤以上，超过1957年全国小麦千斤社数几倍。（编者注：本报6月12日“小资料”内介绍的1957年千斤社系不完全统计）　山东　盛奇丈
