Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Huang

On June 11th, a miracle occurred—the Satellite Commune in Suiping County launched its second high-yield "Sputnik," with a per-mu yield of 3,530 jin and seven liang and a half of wheat.

The reporter visited the Satellite Commune with excitement, and now I would like to share a few small things I saw and heard.

Not Harvesting Wheat, but "Chopping" Wheat

The thirty-five women and seven male commune members in the Second Production Team of the Second Brigade who were harvesting the wheat from that high-yield experimental plot were mostly experienced harvesters, and they all brought two sickles. They started harvesting at night when the weather was cool, but after only a few swings, they were exhausted and had to "chop" the wheat in small handfuls. They had to sharpen their sickles every fifteen minutes. In this way, forty-two men and women, sweating profusely, worked all night and the next morning to "chop" the wheat from the two mu and nine fen of land that created the miracle. On average, each person harvested a little more than half a fen of land. This is the slowest wheat harvesting record in the history of the farmers here!

Threshing for a Full Three Days

The fifty-three-year-old old breeder Chen Jiaxun was responsible for transporting the wheat from this high-yield plot. When talking about this matter, he beamed with joy and said, "In my life, I have never seen dozens of carts of wheat pulled from a plot of land as small as two mu and nine fen. Before liberation, one mu of wheat could be carried away with one load; in the best years after liberation, one mu of land only needed seven or eight loads. This time, I am convinced. These two mu and nine fen of land took forty-two loads!" Cao Tingzhang, Yang Linsheng, Zhao Guorong, Cao Yuming, and four other people transported the wheat from this plot with Chen Jiaxun. They harnessed five large carts and pulled them all night and half a day to transport all the wheat from the two mu and nine fen of land to the threshing ground.

Chen Gen, a young and strong lad and a member of the experimental group, was responsible for leading the stacking and threshing of the wheat. He described the scene to the reporter with great excitement: "The stacking ground was like a battlefield. Seven strong young men were specially responsible for stacking the wheat. The wheat straw from the two mu and nine fen of land occupied a whole side of the threshing ground, which was two mu in size. In order to save space, the wheat was stacked as high as the treetops of an old locust tree on the edge of the ground. One ladder was not high enough, so we joined two ladders together to stack the wheat." When threshing, the two-mu threshing ground was covered with more than two chi of wheat. Twelve strong animals were harnessed to pull six stone rollers. The first threshing took two full days, and the second threshing took another day, but it was still not finished.

A Storm

On the morning of the 10th, when the commune members were threshing the second crop of wheat, the reporter rushed to the scene after hearing the news. Dust flew everywhere on the threshing ground, and more than ten female commune members were turning the wheat from three tall stacks to spread it on the ground. When the reporters saw the three stacks of wheat, they were stunned. Could two mu and nine fen of land produce three large stacks of wheat that were more than two zhang high? For the sake of prudence, they asked Chen Shijun, the leader of the Second Production Team and the person in charge of the experimental field, who was on the ground, and suggested that he check again. He reluctantly asked the female commune members who were turning the stacks, but unexpectedly, this caused a storm. Before the captain could finish speaking, the female commune members started arguing like angry magpies. The female commune member Zhu Xiuying waved her pitchfork and shouted at the reporter across the threshing ground: "Comrade! Are you a bit 'conservative'? Don't you believe in the creativity of the masses! If you don't know how wheat grows, how can you know that there are no three stacks of wheat?" Other female commune members continued, "We are the ones who harvested, stacked, and threshed the wheat ourselves, believe us!" The reporter was silenced by their criticism and blushed.

The "Old Conservative" Has Changed

On the threshing ground, you could often see an old man with white hair and beard, wearing a blue cloth shirt, wandering around. People told the reporter that he was the seventy-year-old Cao Wenzhang. Cao Wenzhang used to be a well-known "old conservative" in the commune, but today, he has also become a promoter. Last year, when the team cadres chose this plot of land as an experimental field, Cao Wenzhang disagreed. He said, "This is a notorious piece of land where you sow one jin and harvest one ladle. It would be great if you could harvest one jin, let alone two thousand jin!" When he saw the cadres sowing thirty jin of wheat seeds per mu in the experimental field, he objected even more. He said, "I have been farming for dozens of years and have never seen so many seeds sown. You are really making a mess!" However, the wheat grew better and better. In March, when the wheat was jointing, it was already more than four chi tall, and the ears were fat and large. In other wheat fields, when the wind blew, the rows of wheat stalks swayed with the wind, but only the wheat in this high-yield experimental field swayed its ears in the wind, and the stalks did not move. At this time, Cao Wenzhang changed his attitude—in the past, he didn't even look at this wheat field, but from then on, he went there at least three times a day. When harvesting the wheat, he picked up a sickle and went to harvest the wheat; when the wheat was transported to the threshing ground, he followed it to the threshing ground. Cao Wenzhang once said to the commune director Zhong Qingde: "This old conservative of mine can't keep up with the 'Great Leap Forward'. It's rare for people to live to seventy years old, and such a good harvest has never happened before. I admire Chairman Mao's good ideas!"

    卫星社放“卫星”的故事
    新华社记者　方徨
    6月11日，奇迹出现了——遂平县卫星社放出了第二颗高产“卫星”，亩产小麦三千五百三十斤零七两半。
    记者怀着兴奋的心情访问了卫星社，现在只把亲眼看到和听到的几件小事介绍给大家。
    不是割麦是“砍”麦
    收割二大队二分队队长那块丰产试验田的麦子的三十五个妇女和七个男社员，大部分都是富有割麦经验的老手，而且每人都带了两张镰，又是趁夜晚天气凉爽开割的，可是没割几镰，就没力气了，大伙只好一小把一小把的“砍”，而且每隔十五分钟就得磨一次镰刀。就这样子，四十二个男女，汗流夹背的干了一夜，第二天又干了一上午，才把那创造奇迹的二亩九分地的麦子“砍”完，平均每个人割了半分多地。这是这儿农民史无前例的割麦最“慢”的纪录！
    整整打了三天场
    五十三岁的老饲养员陈甲勋负责运这块丰产地的麦子。一谈起这桩事，他就喜笑颜开地说：“我一辈子没见过在二亩九分大的一块地里，能拉出几十车麦子来。解放前，一亩小麦一担挑完；解放后这几年，最好的年成一亩地也只挑七、八担。这一回，我算服了，这二亩九分地一连运了四十二车！”和陈甲勋一起运这块地麦子的还有曹庭章、杨林生、赵国荣、曹玉明等四个人，他们套了五辆大车，也是拉了一夜搭半天，才把二亩九分地的麦子全部运到场上。
    负责领导垛麦和打场的是试验小组的组员陈根，他是个年青力壮的小伙子，他眉飞色舞地向记者描述当时的情景说：“垛麦场上像打仗一样，七个青壮年专门负责垛麦，二亩九分地的麦秸整整占了二亩地大的麦场一条边。为了节省地方，麦子垛得和场边一颗老槐树的树稍一样高，一个梯子不够高，就把两个梯子架接起来垛垛。”打场的时候，把二亩地大的麦场，整整铺了二尺多厚，套了十二头壮牲口，拉六个石磙，头场整整压了两天，二场又压了一天，还没有压完。
    一场风波
    10日上午，社员们正在压二场麦的时候，记者闻讯赶来。打麦场上尘土飞扬，十多个女社员正从三垛高大的麦堆上，把麦子翻下来铺场。记者们一看有三个麦垛，就惊住了，二亩九分地能有高到二丈多的三个大麦垛吗？为了慎重起见，便问正在场上的二分队队长、试验田负责人陈世俊，并且建议他再查对一下。他不很情愿地问了正在翻垛的女社员，没想到竟因此引起一场风波。队长话还没有落音，女社员们就像被激怒的喜鹊一样，吵闹开了。女社员朱秀英挥着忙杈，隔着麦场向记者叫喊着：“同志！你们是不是有点‘保守’？别不相信群众的创造呀！不知道小麦生长得啥样，你又咋会知道没有这三垛麦呢？”别的女社员也接着说：“我们是亲手割麦、垛麦和打场的人，相信我们吧！”记者让她们批评得哑口无言，面红耳赤。
    “老保守”变了
    在打麦场上，经常看到一个穿着蓝布衫，须发银白的老年人在转来转去。人们告诉记者，他就是七十岁的曹文章老人。曹文章过去是社里有名的“老保守”，今天，他也变成促进派了。去年，当分队干部选择这块地当试验田的时候，曹文章就不同意。他说：“这是块有名的种一斤打一瓢的地，你们能打一斤就算不错了，还想打双千斤呢？”他看到干部在试验田里一亩地下三十斤麦种，更是反对。他说：“我种了几十年的地，从来没见过下这么多种。你们真像胡闹！”可是，麦子长得越来越好。3月里，麦子拔节的时候，已经有四尺多高了，吐的穗儿又胖又大。别的麦地里，风一吹，行行麦秆随风摆倒，唯有这块丰产试验田的麦子只见风吹穗儿摇，不见麦秆动。这时候，曹文章才转变了态度——过去他连看都不看这块麦地，从那时起，他一天起码要转三次。割麦的时候，他拿起镰刀去割麦；麦子运到场上，他也跟到场上。曹文章有一次对社主任锺清德说：“我这个老保守，赶不上‘跃进啦’，人活七十古来稀，这样好的收成是古来没有的。我算佩服了毛主席的好主意！”
