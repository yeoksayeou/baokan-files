　　Hebei Agricultural Technology Revolution On-site Meeting Cuts Away Inferiority Complex
    Skilled Craftsmen Hold Their Heads High
    Proposes That Workers and Peasants Throughout the Province Break Superstitions, Seek Novelty, and Innovate Inventions
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd) Reporter Zhang Hua reports: The Hebei Province Agricultural Technology Revolution On-site Conference used various methods to help the more than 600 craftsmen participating in the meeting discuss and understand who is the smartest in agricultural tool reform and on whom does the agricultural technology revolution rely, leading these craftsmen to thoroughly break away from the inferiority complex of belittling themselves, and enhance the courage to think boldly, experiment boldly, and invent boldly.

    The more than 600 skilled craftsmen reforming agricultural tools who participated in the Hebei Province Agricultural Technology Revolution On-site Conference were mostly ordinary workers and peasants. In this year's agricultural tool reform movement, they invented and created, reformed agricultural tools, and achieved remarkable results, but due to the influence of oppression by successive ruling classes, they still had a traditional inferiority complex in their thinking. At the beginning of the conference, many people thought that they had no culture and did not understand science and technology. They thought that a little bit of innovation and invention was just a coincidence, and they did not believe in their own creative talents. Therefore, many people were busy drawing blueprints and making models, learning from other people's inventions and creations.

    In response to this situation, the conference immediately adopted various measures to help people liberate their minds. Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, conveyed the main spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to the craftsmen. During the transmission, he focused on introducing to the craftsmen the early fame and "humble" origins of many creators and inventors in politics, economics, science, and culture, both ancient and modern. He also cited many examples of local workers and peasants inventing and creating, to inspire the craftsmen to understand the principle that labor creates the world. Many groups also discussed ideological issues such as who is smarter, workers and peasants or intellectuals, and on whom does agricultural tool reform rely, in connection with making plans. At the same time, the conference also used the craftsmen's own inventions and creations as vivid teaching materials, allowing the inventors to perform and introduce their experiences on the spot, and conduct ideological education for everyone. In this way, the craftsmen saw with their own eyes that the vast majority of inventors of improved agricultural tools were ordinary workers and peasants. The facts dispelled their original superstitious belief that only people with culture and understanding of science could invent and create. At the meeting, an investigation and analysis was also conducted on the background, composition, and educational level of the major inventors. According to statistics, among the 298 inventions and creations in agricultural tool reform in the province, the inventions and creations of workers (including handicraft workers) accounted for about 70%, the inventions and creations of peasants accounted for about 24%, and the inventions and creations of cadres and teachers accounted for about 6%. The educational level of these inventors and creators was: illiterate accounted for 12%, primary school accounted for 82%, middle school accounted for 5%, and university accounted for 1%. This ranking by component origin also provided powerful facts for breaking the craftsmen's inferiority complex.

    Many craftsmen who originally had an inferiority complex, after discussing the past and present, meeting each other, and ranking by component, gradually realized the infinite wisdom of workers and peasants, realized their role and position in agricultural tool reform, boosted their spirits, and were determined to boldly and uniquely create various agricultural tools in an innovative way. Only the craftsmen from eight counties including Shulu and Hengshui who participated in the meeting, after visiting and thinking during the meeting, made plans to create 33 new agricultural tools at the meeting. Some craftsmen also made agreements to carry out competitions, comparing who invents and creates more, and who invents and creates faster. All the craftsmen participating in the meeting also jointly proposed to the workers and peasants of the province to break the inferiority complex, boldly invent and create, and set off a high tide of agricultural tool reform throughout the province.

　　河北农业技术革命现场会议砍掉自卑感
    能工巧匠扬眉吐气
    倡议全省工农破除迷信标新立异创造发明
    本报天津2日电  记者张华报道：河北省农业技术革命现场会议利用多种办法，帮助参加会议的六百多名工匠讨论认识农具改革当中谁最聪明、农业技术革命依靠谁的道理，领导这些工匠大破妄自菲薄的自卑思想，提高大胆想、大胆试验、大胆发明创造的勇气。
    参加河北省农业技术革命现场会议的六百多名改革农具的能工巧匠，绝大多数都是普通的工人和农民。他们在今年的农具改革运动中，发明创造，改革农具，成绩显著，但由于受历代统治阶级压迫的影响，思想上还存在着传统的自卑心理。会议初期，许多人都认为自己没文化，不懂科学技术，有点创造发明，也是偶然巧遇的，不相信自己的创造才能。因此，许多人忙着画图样作模型，学习别人的创造发明。
    针对这种情况，会议即采取多种措施，帮助人们解放思想。中共河北省委书记处书记阎达开，向工匠们传达了党的八大二次会议的主要精神，在传达时着重向工匠们介绍了古今中外许多政治经济科学文化上创造发明者少年成名和“卑贱”的身世。并举出许多当地工农群众发明创造的事例，启发工匠们认识劳动创造世界的道理。许多小组还结合着作规划，讨论了工农群众和知识分子谁最聪明，农具改革依靠谁等思想问题。同时，会议还以工匠们自己的发明创造作活教材，让发明创造者当场表演和介绍经验，向大家进行思想教育。这样，就使工匠们亲眼看到，绝大多数改良农具的发明创造者，都是普通的工人和农民。用事实破除了他们原来认为只有有文化懂科学的人才能发明创造的迷信思想。会上，还对重大的发明创造者的出身成份和文化水平，作了调查分析。据统计，全省在农具改革方面的二百九十八项发明创造当中，工人（包括手工业工人）的发明创造约占70％，农民的发明创造约占24％，干部和教员的发明创造约占6％。这些发明创造者的文化程度是：文盲占12％，小学占82％，中学占5％，大学占1％。这次成份出身的排队，也给打破工匠们的自卑思想，提供了有力的事实。
    许多原来存有自卑思想的工匠，经过比古论今的讨论、互相见面和成份排队，逐渐认识到工人农民的无穷智慧，认识到自己在农具改革当中的作用和地位，振奋了精神，决心标新立异地大胆独创各种农具。仅束鹿、衡水等八县参加会议的工匠，经过会议期间边参观边思考，会上就作出创造发明三十三种新农具的计划。还有些工匠订立协议开展竞赛，比发明创造多，比发明创造快，参加会议的全体工匠，还联名向全省工人农民倡议，打破自卑思想，大胆创造发明，在全省掀起一个农具改革高潮。
