　　Striving to Be Both Cultured and Skilled
　　Lin Mo
    During the Great Leap Forward in production, people realized that physical strength alone was not enough; new technology was also needed. To have new technology, one must study culture and become a laborer who is both cultured and skilled.
    Eliminating illiteracy is the beginning of a cultural revolution for 600 million people. To carry out a cultural revolution, people must first conquer this cultural fortress. The liberated people are ambitious, and millions of them have overcome difficulties and conquered this fortress.
    Ambitious people are constantly moving forward and must not stop after one battle. Learning is like sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you retreat. If we do not further consolidate the results of the literacy campaign, relapse into illiteracy will inevitably occur, leading to the phenomenon of "studying hard for literacy, only to abandon it after completing it." At the same time, we cannot be satisfied with consolidating our achievements; we must expand our achievements and continue to advance. Those who have already become literate must further improve their cultural knowledge.
    The practice of Heilongjiang Province, which has basically eliminated illiteracy, in running spare-time schools on a large scale and launching the "Read 100 Books, Write 10,000 Characters" campaign, provides a good experience for solving this problem.
    The value of this experience lies in the fact that the masses' cultural learning can be well integrated with real life and production, so that learning culture serves current production and politics. They put forward a resounding slogan that greatly encouraged the masses – "Read 100 Books, Write 10,000 Characters!" At the same time, they found a practical way to solve the problem of reading materials for the masses: on the one hand, mobilize cadres from government offices to send books; on the other hand, from the county party committee to the county's agriculture, forestry, water, industry, commerce, culture, education, and health departments, all compile books for the masses. The content of these books includes the county's long-term plans, specific measures, and relevant policies and guidelines. Some counties have even compiled these materials into songbooks and picture albums. Some counties have also specifically compiled scientific and technical reading materials such as "Agricultural Technical Knowledge" and "Agricultural Tool Improvement" according to local needs. Obviously, when the masses read such reading materials, they are learning culture, technology, and politics, which can inspire revolutionary enthusiasm and increase scientific and cultural knowledge.
    Revolution means to stand up. Not only to stand up politically and economically, to stand up ideologically, but also to stand up technologically and culturally. Eliminating illiteracy is only the beginning of cultural emancipation. In order to strive for a complete cultural emancipation, to cultivate an army for technological and cultural revolution, and to enable workers and peasants who have graduated from literacy classes to "Read 100 Books and Write 10,000 Characters" again, will greatly help consolidate the knowledge they have already learned and gradually improve it. With the full-scale development of the technological and cultural revolutions, they will be increasingly tempered and become an important mass force. "With enough perseverance, an iron rod can be ground into a needle." Gao Yubao can write literary creations, and Li Shimei can become a member of the Entomological Society, which shows us the way. As long as we work hard to learn culture and make culture serve current production, thereby improving technology and doing a good job in production, we can strive to become laborers who are both cultured and skilled.

### 要文武双全

　　要文武双全
　　林沫
    在生产跃进中，人们觉得只凭体力不行，还要有新技术。要有新技术，就要学文化，成为一个文武双全的劳动者。
    扫盲是六亿人民文化革命的开端。人们进行文化革命首先要攻克这个文化堡垒。解放了的人民是有志气的，数以千百万计的人们战胜了困难，攻克了这个堡垒。
    有志气的人民是不断前进的，决不能在一个战役以后，就不再前进。学习如逆水行舟，不进则退。如果我们不进一步巩固扫盲成果，就必然会回生复盲，产生“学习下苦工，扫完就算扔”的现象。同时，我们不能只满足于巩固战果，我们还要扩大战果，继续前进。已识字的人们，还要进一步提高文化知识水平。
    基本上扫除文盲的黑龙江省大办业余学校，开展“读百本书、写万个字”运动的作法，为解决这个问题提供了良好的经验。
    这个经验的可贵，在于群众的文化学习同生活实际和生产实际能够很好地结合起来，使学文化为当前的生产和政治服务。他们提出了响亮的、对群众有极大鼓舞性的口号——“读百本书、写万个字”！同时又为解决群众读物的问题，找到了切实的办法：一方面发动机关干部送书；一方面从县委到县的农、林、水、工、商、文教、卫生等有关部门，都为群众编书。这些书的内容包括县的远景规划、具体措施和有关的政策方针。有的县还把这些材料编成了唱本、画册。有的县还根据当地需要，专门编写了“农业技术知识”、“农具改良”等科学技术读物。很明显，群众阅读这样的读物，既是学文化，又是学技术，也是学政治，可以鼓舞革命干劲，增长科学文化知识。
    革命，就是要翻身。不但要在政治上经济上翻身，在思想上翻身，还要在技术上文化上翻身。扫除文盲仅仅是文化翻身的开始，为了争取文化彻底翻身，培养技术革命和文化革命的大军，使已经扫盲毕业的工人、农民，再来“读百本书，写万个字”，将大大有助于已经学得的知识的巩固，并且逐步有所提高。随着技术革命和文化革命的全面开展，他们将日益受到锻炼而成为一支重要的群众力量。“只要功夫深，铁杵磨成绣花针”。高玉宝能写文学创作，李始美可以成为昆虫学会会员，他们给我们指出了道路。只要我们努力学文化，并且使文化为当前的生产服务，从而提高技术，搞好生产，就能争取成为文武双全的劳动者。
