Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 31st. The Tianjin Machine Manufacturing School has produced a "single-cylinder, two-stroke" gas water pump, which is currently the simplest, most economical, and practical irrigation and drainage machinery. Its creation not only solves the urgent need for water lifting tools after China's rural water conservancy development, but also represents a significant technical revolution in the transmission structure of power machinery.

The most significant feature of this water pump is its simple construction. From the outside, its entire structure consists of only a "Y" shaped water pipe and a gas generator. Similar to the double-cylinder, four-stroke agricultural internal combustion water pump developed by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Research Institute not long ago, it is designed based on the principle of using the combustion and explosion power of gas in the water pipe and the inertia of water to directly propel the water to a higher place. Because the water pipe itself replaces the cylinder, it eliminates many complex components of the internal combustion engine and water pump sections found in ordinary irrigation and drainage machinery. Compared to the double-cylinder, four-stroke agricultural internal combustion water pump, it reduces one cylinder and many more complex control mechanisms. According to calculations, this water pump has only twenty-one parts besides the gas generator and screws on the water pipe, and most of them are standard parts. Therefore, as long as there is a sample, rural handicraft cooperatives can imitate it. Excluding the gas generator and cast iron pipe, various parts can be made in only about forty working hours. In the future, after testing, the cast iron pipe may also be replaced by bamboo, ceramic, or cement pipes; the gas generator can be built with bricks or adobe, making it extremely cheap, easy to manufacture, and widely promote.

This water pump has a wide range of fuels and can burn anthracite, charcoal, or biogas. It also uses a small hand stove to heat the red hot pipe for ignition, eliminating the need for electrical ignition, which is even more convenient for rural applications. After ignition, the pressure of the gas explosion propels gushes of water to a higher place. Three air valves also automatically exhaust and intake air in succession. The currently manufactured water pump has a standpipe diameter of six inches, and under a four-meter head, it sprays water an average of seventy-five times per minute, burning seven kilograms of charcoal per hour, and can drain about fifty tons of water. Similar to the one made in Beijing, this water pump can be used as irrigation and drainage machinery, and is expected to be modified into power generation, boat propulsion, and other power equipment. At the same time, because the water pump itself is a three-dimensional straight pipe, it can also be used for well irrigation.

This water pump was proposed by Peng Dingyi, an engineer at the Tianjin Machine Manufacturing School's practice factory, and was researched and trial-produced with the participation of veteran worker Zhu Deheng and with the full support of the school's Party organization. Inspired by the forty articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development, they began bold experiments in 1956, and with the greatest perseverance and determination, after more than ninety experiments, they finally broke through the complex machine structure of old irrigation and drainage equipment and successfully trial-produced it.

After the successful trial production of this water pump, it immediately received attention from the State Technological Commission, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee. On the 29th, Han Guang, Acting Director of the State Technological Commission, Zhang Youxuan, Deputy Director, Liu Zihou, Governor of Hebei Province, Wu Yannong, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, Wan Xiaotang, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and others visited the school to observe the experiment and inquired in detail about the structural principles of the water pump from veteran worker Zhu Deheng and others. Han Guang, Acting Director of the State Technological Commission, and Zhang Youxuan, Deputy Director, believe that this water pump, except for the relatively high fuel consumption, is simpler, easier to maintain and promote than the one made in Beijing. It is necessary to widely exchange the research and trial production experience from all over the country to improve together.

Currently, because some parts of the water pump are not flexible enough, the drainage time can only last for about two hours continuously. Therefore, Li Zhongyuan, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry, Pan Chengxiao, an internal combustion engine expert, and trial producers Peng Dingyi, Zhu Deheng, and others have formed a research team to intensify further improvements to this water pump.

The workers of the Tianjin Machine Manufacturing School's practice factory have decided to produce four of these water pumps within three days, and send two of them to the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition in the capital and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Research Institute and other places, in order to obtain assistance and make the water pump more perfect.

### 构造简单　经济实用  天津制成单缸燃气水泵

    构造简单　经济实用
    天津制成单缸燃气水泵
    新华社天津31日电　天津机器制造学校制成一种“单缸二冲程”燃气水泵，在目前这是排灌机械中最为简单、经济、实用的一种。它的制成不仅可以解决我国农村水利化以后对提水工具的迫切需要，而且从动力机械的传动结构上说，也是一个重大的技术革命。
    这种水泵最大的特点是构造简单。从外形上看来，它的全部结构，只有一个“丩”形的水管加上一个煤气发生炉。它和不久以前北京农业机械研究所制成的双缸四冲程农用内燃水泵，同样是利用煤气在水管中燃烧爆炸的力量和水的惯性直接把水冲向高处的原理设计成功的。由于水管本身代替了汽缸，它免去了普通排灌机械中内燃机和水泵部分许多复杂的机件。它比双缸四冲程农用内燃水泵，减少了一个汽缸和许多较为复杂的控制机构。据计算：这种水泵除了煤气发生炉和水管上的螺丝钉以外，只有二十一个零件，而且大都是采取标准件。因此，只要有了样品，农村的手工业社就可以仿造。除煤气炉和铸铁管外，各种零件只要大约四十多个工时就可制成。将来经过试验，铸铁管还有可能用竹管、陶瓷管或水泥管代替；煤气炉可用砖或土坯砌成，因而成本极其便宜，便于制造和大量推广。
    这种水泵的燃料很广泛，可以烧无烟煤、木炭或沼气，它还采用小手炉烤红火管点火，不用电力点火，更利农村应用。煤气经过点火后，爆炸的压力冲激着一股股地水汹涌地喷向高处。三个气阀也接连着自动地排气和进气。现在制成的这台水泵，立管直径为六英寸，在扬程四公尺条件下，每分钟平均喷水七十五次，每小时燃木炭七公斤，可排水五十吨左右。这种水泵和北京制成的一台相同，除可作排灌机械外，还可望改装成发电、行船和作其他动力的设备。同时，由于这种水泵的本身是一个立体的直管，还可用于井灌。
    这种水泵是天津机器制造学校实习工厂工程师彭定一提出，经过老工人朱德恒等人参加，在学校党组织的全力支持下，研究试制成功的。他们在农业发展纲要四十条的鼓舞下，于1956年开始大胆试验，并以最大的恒心和毅力，经过九十多次试验，终于突破了旧排灌设备中复杂的机器构造而试制成功。
    这种水泵试制成功后，立即受到国家技术委员会、中共河北省委、中共天津市委的重视。29日，国家技术委员会代主任韩光、副主任张有萱，河北省省长刘子厚，中共河北省委书记吴砚农、天津市委第一书记万晓塘等前往学校参观试验，并向老工人朱德恒等详细地询问了水泵的构造原理。国家技术委员会代主任韩光、副主任张有萱认为这台水泵，除燃料消耗尚较多外，比北京制成的一台，更简单、更易维护和推广，很需要把全国各地进行这种研究及试制经验，广为交流，共同提高。
    目前，因为水泵的部分零件尚不够灵活，排水时间只能连续两小时左右，因此，天津市机电工业局局长李中垣和内燃机专家潘承孝，试制人彭定一、朱德恒等组成了研究小组，加紧对这种水泵作进一步地改进。
    天津机器制造学校实习工厂的工人们决定在三天内生产四台这种水泵，并送两台到首都的全国农具展览会和北京农业机械研究所等地，以便取得帮助，使水泵改进得更加完善。（附图片）
