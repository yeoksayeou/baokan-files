Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 23rd. The famous Yang Dezhong plastering team of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works (WISCO) construction site has recently modified a mortar pump into a concrete pressure grouting machine for use in concrete pouring projects. This is an innovative breakthrough in China's concrete technology.

Traditionally, concrete projects involve mixing concrete in a mixing plant, transporting it to the construction site, filling it into the formwork of the structure, and then compacting it with vibrators by concrete workers. However, the concrete pressure grouting machine modified by Yang Dezhong's group fundamentally reforms the concrete construction process, greatly simplifying the construction process. It only requires placing the stones into the formwork of the structure first, and then using the pressure grouting machine to squeeze the pre-mixed cement mortar into the gaps between the stones.

After the successful modification of the concrete pressure grouting machine, two operational tests were conducted at the WISCO construction site. The results showed that using this machine to pour concrete has five advantages: (1) The equipment is simple and easy to move, eliminating the need for mixing plants and vibrators; (2) The pouring speed is fast, with each pressure grouting machine capable of pouring 40 to 50 cubic meters of concrete in eight hours, greatly exceeding the usual pouring speed; (3) It can save cement and operating platforms and scaffolding during concrete construction; (4) It greatly reduces the heavy physical labor of concrete workers; (5) It can ensure the quality of concrete projects.

Yang Dezhong is a Communist Party member who began as an apprentice at the age of fourteen and has been working for more than thirty years without having attended school for even a year. The most educated members of the plastering team he leads have only attended school for five or six years. Due to their infinite loyalty to the cause of socialist construction and their indomitable will, Yang Dezhong and his partners spent more than two years successfully researching and developing concrete pressure grouting. During the research process, the Party organization helped them overcome the ridicule of conservatives and various difficulties.

Yang Dezhong's plastering team is one of the earliest advanced teams to emerge in the national construction industry. From 1951 to the present, they have been selected as an advanced team forty-four times in Northeast China and Wuhan, creating and improving twenty-two kinds of advanced construction tools, and basically achieving the mechanization of plastering operations. Now, they are a shining banner on the WISCO construction site.

### 混凝土压力灌浆机改装成功  杨德重小组的创举使混凝土施工可以不用搅拌厂和震动器

    混凝土压力灌浆机改装成功
    杨德重小组的创举使混凝土施工可以不用搅拌厂和震动器
    新华社武汉23日电  武钢工地著名的杨德重抹灰工小组，最近把砂浆输送泵改装成了混凝土压力灌浆机，用在混凝土浇灌工程上。这是我国混凝土技术上的一项革新创举。
    历来，混凝土工程都是先在搅拌厂里把混凝土搅拌出来，然后运往施工现场，填进建筑物的模型板内，由混凝土工人用震动器进行捣固。而杨德重小组所改装的混凝土压力灌浆机，从根本上改革了混凝土工程施工程序，施工过程大大简化了，只需先把石子放进建筑物的模型板内，然后用压力灌浆机把事先配好的水泥砂浆压挤进石子的空隙中就行了。
    混凝土压力灌浆机改装成功以后，曾经在武钢工地作过两次操作试验；试验的结果表明，用这种机械浇灌混凝土，有五个好处：（一）设备简单，便于移动，搅拌厂、震动器都可以省去不用了；（二）浇灌速度快，每台压力灌浆机八小时可以浇灌四十到五十立方公尺混凝土，大大超过通常的浇灌速度；（三）可以节约水泥和混凝土施工时的操作台、脚手架；（四）大大减轻了混凝土工人繁重的体力劳动；（五）能保证混凝土工程质量。
    杨德重是共产党员，从十四岁开始当学徒，至今已经有三十多年工龄，没有念过一年书。他领导的抹灰工小组，受教育最多的人也只不过念过五、六年书。由于对社会主义建设事业的无限忠诚和百折不挠的意志，杨德重和他的伙伴们用了两年多时间，才研究成功混凝土压力灌浆。在钻研过程中，党组织帮助他们战胜了保守者的热讽冷潮和种种困难。
    杨德重抹灰工小组是全国建筑界最早出现的先进小组之一。从1951年到现在，他们在东北和武汉，已经连续四十四次被评选为先进小组，创造和改进了二十二种先进建筑工具，基本上实现了抹灰操作的机械化。现在，他们是武钢工地上一面光辉的旗帜。
