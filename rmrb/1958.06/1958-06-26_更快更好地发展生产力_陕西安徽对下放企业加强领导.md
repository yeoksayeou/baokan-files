To develop productivity faster and better
Shaanxi and Anhui Strengthen Leadership over Enterprises Delegated to Lower Levels
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th June: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee are strengthening leadership over enterprises delegated from the central government in all aspects, so that these large enterprises can play a greater role in socialist construction. From March this year to now, the ministries of the central government have successively delegated twenty-nine large factories, mines, and management organizations, both completed and under construction, to Shaanxi Province for direct leadership and management. The province's leading departments attach great importance to this, and Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, Shi Yizhi, Vice Governor, and others personally oversee the work of these enterprises.
    Due to the strengthened leadership, the problems existing in these enterprises can now be solved more promptly. For example, Tongchuan needed to recruit and train more than 1,200 workers in advance this year, and the relevant departments in Shaanxi Province quickly resolved this.
    The province has rationally adjusted and arranged the equipment and manpower of the delegated enterprises according to local needs, and organized close cooperation between various units, which is more conducive to the development of local industry. The distribution of the power industry in the Shaanxi area was originally uneven, but now Shaanxi Province has decided to make reasonable adjustments. The Northwest Textile Administration, which was delegated earliest and previously only managed several large state-owned textile factories, has now taken over the management of many small cotton, linen, silk, and other textile factories in Shaanxi Province. They have also planned this year's construction projects according to the needs of local industrial development. The Coal Mine Administration has also transferred many drilling rigs, diesel engines, and technicians to support the newly built small coal mines. The Metallurgical Bureau is actively leading the construction of iron smelting, steel smelting, coking, refractory materials, and non-ferrous metal factories and mines in various places.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 25th June: After the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine was delegated to Anhui Province for management, it will produce more coal to support national construction.
    Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recently convened a meeting to study the production situation of the Huainan Coal Mine and decided to complete the original production plan of producing 10 million tons of coal in 1962 ahead of schedule in 1959. Huainan Coal Mine has already begun to take measures to ensure the completion of this task.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also studied the preparatory work for the Huaibei Coal Mine, which contains a large amount of coking coal, and decided to increase the mine from the originally planned eleven pairs of mine shafts to fifteen pairs this year, increasing the design capacity from more than 6 million tons to 8 million tons.
    The Provincial Party Committee also decided to establish the Anhui Provincial Coal Industry Administration to strengthen leadership over the coal industry; at the same time, more than 100 cadres were transferred from the Huainan Coal Mine to establish the Huaibei Coal Mine Preparatory Office. The province has increased the number of demobilized military cadres by more than 60 to strengthen the leadership of the Huainan and Huaibei mines. The manpower, equipment, and materials needed for the construction of the two mines will also be given priority.

    更快更好地发展生产力
    陕西安徽对下放企业加强领导
    据新华社西安25日电　中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会从各方面加强对中央下放企业的领导，使这些大型企业在社会主义建设中发挥更大作用。从今年3月到现在，中央各部已陆续将建成和正在建设的二十九个大厂矿、管理机构都下放归了陕西省直接领导和管理。省的领导部门十分重视，中共省委第一书记张德生、副省长时逸之等，都亲自抓这些企业的工作。
    由于加强领导，这些企业存在的问题现在更能及时地得到解决。如铜川今年需要提前吸收一千二百多工人加以训练，陕西省有关部门很快就解决了。
    省里根据本地的需要，合理调整安排了下放企业的设备和人力，组织各单位之间的密切协作，更有力于地方工业的发展。原来陕西地区电力工业分布不平衡，现在陕西省已决定作合理调整。下放最早、过去只管几个大型国营纺织厂的西北纺织管理局，已把陕西省很多小型的棉、麻、丝等纺织厂管理起来了。他们还根据当地发展地方工业需要，规划了今年的建设项目。煤矿管理局也抽调出不少钻机、柴油机和技术工人支援各新建的小型煤矿。冶金局正在积极领导各地建设炼铁、炼钢、炼焦、耐火材料以及有色金属厂矿。
    据新华社合肥25日电　国营淮南煤矿下放给安徽省管理以后，将生产出更多的煤支援国家建设。
    中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣最近亲自召开会议，研究了淮南煤矿的生产情况，决定把原定1962年产煤一千万吨的生产计划提前在1959年完成。淮南煤矿已经开始采取措施，保证完成这个任务。
    中共安徽省委对于蕴藏着大量炼焦煤的淮北煤矿的筹建工作，也作了研究，决定把这个矿由原计划今年建设的十一对矿井增加为十五对，设计能力六百多万吨增加到八百万吨。
    省委还决定成立安徽省煤炭工业管理局，加强对煤炭工业的领导；同时，从淮南煤矿抽调一百多名干部建立淮北煤矿筹备处。省里已增派部队转业干部六十多人，来充实淮南和淮北两矿的领导力量。两矿建井工作所需的人力、设备和材料，也将得到优先满足。
