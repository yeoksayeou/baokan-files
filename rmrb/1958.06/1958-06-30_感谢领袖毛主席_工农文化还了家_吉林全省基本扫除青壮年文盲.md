Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 29th. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jilin Provincial People's Committee announced on the 27th that the province has basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. The Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee reported this good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao as a gift to the Party's birthday.

The basic elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in Jilin Province is a major achievement obtained by the people of the province after persisting in the eleven-year literacy campaign. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, an educational system for workers, peasants, and laborers, from elementary school and middle school to university, has basically taken shape in the province; the cultural revolution in the province has already begun! The people enthusiastically sing the praises of cultural emancipation:

	The ancient tree of a thousand years has blossomed,
	The frozen river of a thousand years has thawed;
	Thank Leader Chairman Mao,
	The culture of workers and peasants has returned home.

	The ancient tree of a thousand years has blossomed,
	The culture of a thousand years must return home;
	Since the Communist Party came,
	Workers and peasants read and learn culture.

According to statistics from the Jilin Provincial Literacy Association, illiteracy among young and middle-aged cadres in the province has been completely eliminated; among the 533,880 young and middle-aged workers, the number of non-illiterates has reached 466,611, accounting for 87.3%; among the 3,126,072 young and middle-aged farmers, the number of non-illiterates has reached 2,613,275, accounting for 83.5%; among the 967,193 young and middle-aged urban residents, the number of non-illiterates has reached 804,377, accounting for 83.1%, reaching the national standard for basic elimination of illiteracy.

Before liberation, Jilin Province was a culturally backward province, with illiteracy accounting for more than 80% of the province's population. After liberation, the revolutionary masses of workers and peasants, who had no opportunity to learn culture for generations, became increasingly eager to learn culture with the development of industrial and agricultural production. Under the leadership of the Party, in 1946, the province launched a large-scale winter literacy campaign for workers and peasants. Starting in 1948, the winter schools were changed to year-round people's schools, so that literacy work could be carried out regularly.

This cultural emancipation literacy movement was developed by inheriting and promoting the educational experience of the old liberated areas in combining politics, culture, and production. This teaching method, through a variety of lively forms, disseminates experience, promotes production, and achieves consistency between learning and application. When the high-yield experience of equidistant wide sowing in Zhaoyuan, Heilongjiang Province, appeared, people's schools in various parts of Jilin Province compiled this high-yield experience into teaching materials and first disseminated it in people's schools. When relevant departments issued flood prevention notices, people's schools organized study, and students not only learned characters but also understood the government's policies and actively participated in the flood prevention struggle. This teaching method is not limited by time, place, and other conditions. It can be learned in the fields, on the ground, on the kang, in the classroom, or in the morning, evening, or at noon. Therefore, the masses warmly welcome this teaching method.

At present, Jilin Province has established more than 30 spare-time universities, and the Gongzhuling Special District has an average of one and a half agricultural middle schools in each township. Every agricultural cooperative has a scientific and technological research group. These organizations are accepting more than one million literacy graduates and continuing their studies along this vocational education system.

### “感谢领袖毛主席　工农文化还了家”  吉林全省基本扫除青壮年文盲

    “感谢领袖毛主席　工农文化还了家”
    吉林全省基本扫除青壮年文盲
    据新华社长春29日电　中共吉林省委和吉林省人民委员会于27日宣布：全省已基本扫除青壮年文盲，省委和省人委将这一喜讯报告党中央和毛主席，作为向党的生日的献礼。
    吉林省基本扫除青壮年文盲是全省人民坚持了十一年扫盲运动所获得的重大成果。在扫除文盲的基础上，一个从小学、中学到大学的工农劳动群众的教育体系，已在全省基本形成；全省的文化革命已经开始了！人民群众热情地歌颂文化翻身：
    千年的古树开了花，
    千年的冻河开了化；
    感谢领袖毛主席，
    工农文化还了家。
    千年古树开了花呀，
    千年文化要还家呀；
    自从来了共产党，
    工农读书学文化。
    据吉林省扫盲协会统计，全省青壮年干部文盲已全部扫除；在五十三万三千八百八十名青壮年职工中，非文盲数已达四十六万六千六百一十一名，占87.3％；在三十一万二千六百零七十二名青壮年农民中，非文盲已达二百六十一万三千二百七十五名，占83.5％；九十六万七千一百九十三名青壮年市民中，非文盲已达八十万四千三百七十七名，占83.1％，达到国家规定基本扫除文盲的标准。
    解放以前，吉林省是一个文化落后的省份，文盲占全省人口80％以上。解放后，世代没有机会学文化的工农革命群众，随着工农业生产的向前发展，对学习文化的要求日益迫切。在党的领导下，1946年，全省开展了大规模工农冬学扫盲识字运动。从1948年开始，改冬学为常年民校，使扫盲工作能够经常进行。
    这个文化大翻身的扫盲运动，是继承和发扬了老解放区的政治、文化、生产三者合一的教育经验发展起来的。这种教学方法通过多种多样、生动活泼的形式，传播经验，推动生产，作到学用一致。当黑龙江省肇源等距宽播的丰产经验出现后，吉林省各地民校都以这个丰产经验编写成教材，首先在民校传播。当有关部门发出防汛通知后，民校就组织学习，学员既识了字，又了解了政府的政策，都踊跃参加防汛斗争。这种教学方法不受时间、地点等条件的限制，可以在田间、地头、炕头、课堂学，也可以在早上、晚间或晌午学。因此群众热烈欢迎这种教学方法。
    目前，吉林省已办起三十余所业余大学，公主岭专区平均每个乡已有一所半农业中学。每个农业社都有科学技术研究小组。这些组织，正接纳一百万以上的脱盲学员，沿着这个业余教育体系继续深造。
