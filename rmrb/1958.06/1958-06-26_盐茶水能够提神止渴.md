Why?

    Salt tea water can refresh and quench thirst.
    For people who work in high-temperature environments, and athletes who are often active in the hot sun, salt tea water is the most economical and ideal heat-prevention drink. It is made with one part salt to one hundred parts tea water. Salt can help the human body quickly eliminate harmful substances and replenish the sodium lost by the body due to sweating (excessive sodium loss can cause fatigue and weakness). Tea contains tannic acid and caffeine. The former can stimulate the increase of gastric juice, and the latter can improve the excitability of the central nervous system, reduce fatigue, clear the mind, and enhance mental and physical strength. Moreover, caffeine does not cause fatigue when it stimulates the central nervous system.

    盐茶水能够提神止渴
    对于在高温环境中工作的人们，以及经常在烈日当头下进行活动的运动员们，盐茶水是一种最经济、最理想的防暑饮料。它是用一百份茶水加一份盐作成的。盐能帮助人体迅速排除体内有害物质，补充人体因流汗而损耗掉的钠（钠的过度耗损会使人疲劳无力）。茶叶内含有鞣酸和咖啡因，前者能刺激胃液增生，后者能提高中枢神经的兴奋性，减轻疲劳，清晰神智，加健脑力与体力。而且，咖啡因在兴奋中枢神经的时候，不会使人发生疲劳现象。
