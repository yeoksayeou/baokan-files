    Education Must Serve Production
    Shanghai's Workers' Spare-Time Education Geared Towards Practicality, Teaching Quality Greatly Improved

    (Our reporter Lu Zuohua reports) Shanghai's workers' spare-time education, after the rectification campaign, has implemented the policy of serving production. Since the liberation of Shanghai, workers' spare-time schools have greatly developed. However, in the concrete implementation of the policy of serving politics and serving production, there were shortcomings. Among some cadres and teachers, there was a general existence of the idea of "improving culture for the sake of improving culture" and the so-called "regularization." The teaching plans and rules and regulations of spare-time education had many aspects that were divorced from production and reality. Some workers were not interested in this kind of learning, so they often did not come to class.

    During the rectification campaign, under the leadership of the Party, teachers, students, and cadres of workers' spare-time education in various schools debated the policy of workers' spare-time education in the form of big-character posters and discussion meetings, exposing serious shortcomings of being divorced from reality, production, and the masses. The educational leadership departments then took a series of measures to reform workers' spare-time education. Starting in March of this year, teachers were first organized to go to factories to participate in production labor, which not only enabled them to begin to acquire production knowledge and understand the political life and various activities of workers, but also found ways to serve production. Many teachers realized from actual labor that linking with production is an important key to improving teaching quality. One chemistry teacher, after working in a factory doing the work of ironing and drying wet towels with steam, used the method of steam ironing as a practical example when teaching the section on "the effect of steam" in class. Some teachers have begun to use workers' language in their lectures. Because the lectures are combined with actual production, classroom teaching has become lively and vivid.

    While mobilizing teachers to participate in production labor, all schools in the city put forward the slogan of self-compiling teaching materials. Because teachers went to factories to work and did some production surveys and research, they deeply felt that the teaching materials must be improved. After conducting in-depth investigations in several machine factories, the No. 42 Workers' Spare-Time Middle School found that the Pythagorean theorem and the preliminary knowledge of trigonometry were very useful for machine workers. These courses were originally to be learned in high school, but now they have been added to the junior high school textbooks. When chemistry teachers teach workers in printing and dyeing factories and paper mills about the knowledge of "water," they focus on supplementing the principles of soft and hard water, which are very important in production.

    In order to make workers' spare-time education meet the needs of production and make it more convenient for workers to enroll, schools throughout the city are further reforming the school system and curriculum, and adopting a variety of teaching plans, such as running technical classes, shortening the school system, and opening single-subject elective classes. The Shanghai Tool Factory has combined spare-time junior high school with technical studies in the factory, and in addition to teaching cultural knowledge, it also teaches workers the necessary blueprint reading, metal materials, and mechanical parts courses. In some regional workers' spare-time middle schools, classes such as fitter technology, lathe technology, and common sense of cotton spinning are also set up according to the students' work situation. The junior high school is shortened to three years, and the primary school is shortened to two years.

    Various schools have also adopted many flexible teaching forms to adapt to workers' production time and enable students to persist in learning. Now many schools have opened Sunday classes and "factory holiday" classes, specifically for busy cadres. Some schools have established a three-shift system according to the factory's production time; others have broken the conventional three-shift system and proposed "workers can attend classes whenever they are free," increasing the number of learning times from three to eight a day. These flexible organizational forms are generally welcomed by workers. According to preliminary statistics in April, the attendance rate of students at all levels of schools reached about 85%, and in many schools it was as high as 98% to 100%, eliminating the phenomenon of absenteeism without reason.

    Now, Shanghai has formed a workers' spare-time education network that serves production. There are 737 workers' spare-time schools at all levels distributed in various districts and large factories throughout the city, including 242 middle schools, with a total of 450,000 workers studying. In the past nine years, more than 200,000 people have graduated from workers' spare-time primary schools, junior high schools, and high schools. Now 25% of the city's workers have reached the level of secondary education.

### 教育必须为生产服务  上海职工业余教育面向实际，教学质量大大提高

    教育必须为生产服务
    上海职工业余教育面向实际，教学质量大大提高
    本报讯　记者陆左华报道：上海市的职工业余教育经过整风以后，已贯彻了为生产服务的方针。上海解放后，职工业余学校有了很大的发展。但是，在具体贯彻执行为政治、为生产服务的方针当中存在缺点，在部分干部和教师中，普遍地存在着“为提高文化而提高文化”和所谓“正规化”的思想。业余教育的教学计划和规章制度存在着不少脱离生产、脱离实际的情况。有些职工对这样的学习没有兴趣，因此常常不来上课。
    在整风中，在党的领导下，各校的教师、学生和职工业余教育的干部用大字报、座谈会等形式对职工业余教育的方针进行了辩论，揭露出脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离群众的严重缺点。教育领导部门接着采取了一系列的改革职工业余教育的措施。从今年3月开始，首先组织教师下工厂参加生产劳动，不仅使他们开始获得了生产知识，了解了工人的政治生活和各项活动，而且摸到了为生产服务的途径。许多教师从劳动实际中，体会到联系生产是提高教学质量的重要关键。有一位化学教师在工厂做过用蒸汽烫平和烘干湿毛巾的工作，她在课堂上就把蒸汽烘烫的方法作为讲“蒸汽作用”这一节课的实际例子。有些教师讲课中开始运用工人的语言。由于讲课结合生产实际，课堂教学开始生动活泼。
    在发动教师参加生产劳动的同时，全市各校提出了自编教材的口号。由于教师下厂劳动，作了一些生产的调查研究，他们深切地感到必须改进教材。第四十二职工业余中学深入几个机器厂进行调查后，发现勾股定理和三角的初步知识对机器工人很有用处，原来这些课程要等到高中再学，现在已补充在初中课本里了。化学教师对印染厂、造纸厂的工人讲“水”的知识时，就着重补充了生产上非常重要的软水和硬水的原理。
    为了使职工业余教育符合生产需要，更便利职工入学，全市的学校正在进一步改革学制课程，采取多种多样的教学计划，像开办技术班、缩短学制、开设单科选修班等。上海工具厂已把业余初中和工厂里的技术学习结合起来，除了讲授文化知识外，还教工人需要的识图、金属材料、机械零件等课程。在一些地区性的职工业余中学中，也根据学生工作情况设钳工工艺、车工工艺、棉纺常识等班级。并把初中缩短为三年，小学缩短为二年。
    各校还采取了很多灵活的教学形式，适应工人生产时间，使学生坚持学习。现在许多学校开设了星期日班，“厂礼拜”班，专收工作忙的干部。有的学校根据工厂的生产时间设立了三班制；还有的打破了三班制常规，提出“职工什么时候空，就什么时候上课”，从一天三个学习时间增加到八个学习时间，这些灵活的组织形式，普遍受到工人欢迎。据4月份初步统计，各级学校学生的上课出席率达到85％左右，不少学校高达98％至100％，消灭了无故旷课现象。
    现在，上海市已组成了一个为生产服务的职工业余教育网。分布在全市各区和大型工厂内的各级职工业余学校有七百三十七所，其中包括中学二百四十二所，在学职工总数达四十五万人。九年来，从职工业余小学、初中、高中毕业的已有二十万多人。现在全市有25％的职工达到了中学程度。
