Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st - Cement plants have been established in most provinces of our country, and the cement industry has begun to flourish nationwide.

Since the spring of this year, provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong have built 5,078 small cement plants. The cement produced has been widely used in small and medium-sized reservoirs, culverts, dams, canals, fish ponds, biogas digesters, and other projects, thus alleviating the tight cement supply in some areas. According to reports from various places, the quality of cement produced by indigenous methods is very good, generally with a grade of 100 or higher. In Mancheng and Tangshan in Hebei Province, and Yanshi in Henan Province, some cement reaches a grade of over 300. The cement raw materials discovered in various places are extremely abundant, such as red clay, chalky soil, porcelain clay, limestone, and gypsum, which are almost everywhere.

Through this period of development, the superstition that cement can only be produced by large factories and modern machinery has been shattered. In Xixian County, Henan Province, there are even two small cement plants run entirely by housewives, and the quality of the cement they produce is also very good.

    打破迷信  遍地开花
    全国建成五千多座小水泥厂
    新华社郑州21日电  我国大多数省份已举办了水泥厂，水泥工业开始在全国遍地开花。
    从今年春季以来，河北、江苏、山东、安徽、河南、湖北、江西、广东等省，已经建成小型水泥厂五千零七十八座，出产的水泥已广泛地运用到中小型水库、涵闸、水坝、渠道、鱼塘、沼气发生池等工程上，因而缓和了有些地区水泥供应紧张的状况。根据各地反映，用土法生产的水泥质量很好，一般标号在一百号以上。河北省满城、唐山，河南省偃师等地有的水泥达到三百多号。各地发掘的水泥原料极为丰富，如红粘土、白垩土、瓷土、石灰石、石膏等几乎到处都有。
    经过这段时期的发展，水泥只有大工厂和现代化机器才能生产的迷信已被打破。河南省息县甚至出现了两个完全由家庭妇女经营的小水泥厂，她们生产出来的水泥质量也很好。
