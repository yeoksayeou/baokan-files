Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The builders of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, after 140 days and nights of intense battle, completed the earthwork of the flood control dam at 3 p.m. today, ahead of schedule. The excavation of the spillway stonework and the installation of the intake tower and water diversion pipes have also been completed. This is a great leap forward, a great victory.

The flood control dam, eight or nine stories high, stands between the Mangshan and Hanbao mountains of the Ming Tombs, horizontally locking the Shahe tributary of the Wenyu River, which causes trouble every year.

Like a mandarin fish lying diagonally in the northern suburbs of the capital, the Ming Tombs Reservoir can block floods from a drainage area of more than 200 square kilometers, store 60 million cubic meters of water, irrigate more than 250,000 mu of land, and prepare important conditions for the construction of the Ming Tombs scenic area.

In the process of building this reservoir, the people of the capital fully demonstrated the communist spirit of breaking superstitions and daring to think and act. According to conventional practice, the construction of this reservoir would require several years of preparation and several years of construction. After the farmers of Changping District, where the reservoir is located, proposed that the Ming Tombs Reservoir must be built ahead of schedule, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee supported and approved this request, and decided to start construction ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of the Party, more than 20,000 farmers from Changping District who brought their own food and more than 10,000 farmers from fraternal districts started working immediately. Some troops stationed in Beijing and cadres from government organizations also poured in like a tide. Construction officially started on January 21 this year.

The flood control dam—the main body of the reservoir—was built through voluntary labor. Up to now, more than 300,000 people have come to the construction site to work, totaling 7 million workdays. These include workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, school teachers and students, shop assistants, religious believers, and street residents. Since the start of construction, there have been heroic collectives and model figures everywhere on the construction site within dozens of miles around. There are Eighteen Warriors, Seven Comrades-in-Arms, Nine Orchid Groups, Five Tiger Generals, Ye Ting Regiment, Huang Jiguang Company, Iron and Steel Youth Commando, and so on. According to statistics from the General Headquarters for Reservoir Construction, more than 2,872 advanced units and 20,409 special-class and first, second, and third-class model figures have emerged in the past four months.

Chairman Mao, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and responsible comrades from various provincial and municipal Party committees came to the construction site to participate in labor, which brought the enthusiasm of the voluntary laborers to a boiling point, and created the national record for transporting earth to the dam on that day.

Technological innovation and record-breaking are the biggest features of voluntary labor participating in the construction of the reservoir. These inventions have greatly accelerated the construction speed of the reservoir.

The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing are the backbone and main force in building this reservoir. They established a Support the Ming Tombs Reservoir Committee, sent leading cadres to directly participate in the leadership of the construction after the project started, successively transferred more than 40,000 officers and soldiers to undertake the most arduous tasks in the project, and transported many mechanical equipment at no cost to support the construction of the reservoir. The officers and soldiers regarded the construction site as a battlefield, and went wherever there were difficulties.

During the construction of the reservoir, many personnel from foreign embassies in China, foreign experts in Beijing, and foreign guests visiting our country also came to participate in voluntary labor and sweated for the construction of this reservoir.

After the basic completion of the dam project, the voluntary laborers on the construction site have fully entered the final stage of the project. (Photo attached)

    30万人的辛勤劳动　140个昼夜的紧张战斗
    十三陵水库主体工程基本完工
    新华社11日讯　十三陵水库的建设者，经过一百四十昼夜紧张的战斗，已在今天下午三时提前完成拦洪大坝的土方工程。溢洪道石方的开凿和进水塔、输水管的安装工程也都全部完工。这是一个巨大的跃进，巨大的胜利。
    有八九层楼高的拦洪大坝，耸立在明十三陵的蟒山和汉包山之间，横锁住每年为患的温榆河的沙河支流。
    像一条桂鱼斜卧在首都北郊的十三陵水库，能够拦住二百多平方公里流域面积内的洪水，蓄水六千万立方公尺，浇地二十五万多亩，并且为十三陵风景区的建设准备了重要条件。
    首都人民在修建这座水库过程中，充分表现出破除迷信、敢想敢干的共产主义风格。按照常规，修建这个水库，要几年准备，几年施工。水库所在地的昌平区农民提出了一定要提前修建十三陵水库的要求后，中共北京市委和北京市人民委员会支持并批准了这个要求，决定提前开工。在党的领导下，自带伙食的两万多昌平区农民和一万多兄弟区的农民说干就干，一部分驻京部队和机关干部也像潮水般涌来。今年1月21日正式开工。
    拦洪大坝——水库的主体工程，是用义务劳动修筑的。到目前为止，已经有三十多万人到工地上来劳动，共做了七百万个工作日。其中有工人、农民、解放军官兵、机关干部、学校师生、店员、宗教徒和街道居民。开工以来在周围几十里的工地上，到处有英雄的集体和模范人物。这里有十八勇士、七战友、九兰组、五虎将和叶挺团、黄继光连、钢铁青年突击队等等。据水库修建总指挥部统计，在四个多月中共出现了二千八百七十二个先进单位，二万零四百零九名特等和一、二、三等模范人物。
    毛主席、中共中央委员、各省市委的负责同志等到工地参加劳动，使义务劳动者们的劳动热情达到了沸点，当天创造了运土上坝的全国最高纪录。
    革新技术、刷新纪录，是义务劳动参加水库修建工程的最大特色。这些创造发明都大大加快了水库的建设速度。
    中国人民解放军驻京部队是建设这个水库的骨干力量和主要力量。他们成立了支援十三陵水库委员会，在工程开工以后派领导干部直接参加了施工的领导，陆续抽调了四万多官兵担负工程中最艰巨的任务，并且无代价地运来许多机械器材，支援水库的建设。官兵们把工地当作战场，哪里有困难，他们就到哪里去。
    在水库修建期间，很多国家驻中国大使馆人员、在北京的外国专家和访问我国的外宾，也来参加了义务劳动，为修建这个水库流了汗。
    在大坝工程基本完工以后，工地上的义务劳动者已全面进入结尾工程。（附图片）
