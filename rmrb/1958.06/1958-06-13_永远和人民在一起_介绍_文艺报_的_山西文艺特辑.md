Forever With the People
—Introducing the "Literary Gazette's" "Shanxi Literature Special Issue"
Shi Mei

The flowers of our country's literature and art are blooming everywhere. In various provinces and autonomous regions, the leadership of literary and artistic work has accumulated many successful experiences, writers have created many excellent works, and workers and peasants have sung millions of heroic songs. These should be given timely promotion and enthusiastic commentary. To this end, the "Literary Gazette" specially sent editors to Taiyuan, and with the help of the Shanxi literary and art circles, compiled the "Shanxi Literature Special Issue." This special issue was published in the eleventh issue of the "Literary Gazette" on the 11th of this month. The "Shanxi Literature Special Issue" includes Li Shuwei's "Forever With the People," Chen Xiaoyu's "Write the Newest and Most Beautiful Poems," Ba Ren's "Brief Discussion on Comrade Zhao Shuli's Creation," and reports such as "National Artistic Style, Strong Life Atmosphere – Symposium on Short Stories in 'Spark'," "Let Red Flags Be Planted All Over the Literary and Ideological Front in Shanxi Province!" as well as short story reviews, totaling fourteen articles. The "Literary Gazette" editor's note states: "We believe that the spirit of Shanxi literary and art workers and literary publications closely connecting with the masses is worth learning from." Many writers and young authors in Shanxi grew up in the liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Party, they participated in the struggle against the enemy, rent and interest reduction, land reform, and rectification movements, and had the experience of sharing weal and woe with the masses. After liberation, they often went deep into the countryside, and many took on work in the countryside. This is the foundation for them to create good works. Ba Ren's article discusses the aspects of life reflected in "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Li Youcai's Rhymes," "Changes in Li Family Village," and "Three Mile Bay," the pulse of the times, and the development of the themes expressed by the author. The author points out that Comrade Zhao Shuli is good at creating positive and active characters, "and always combines the fate of these positive and active characters with the pace of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, ending in victory." The author also discusses the national style of Zhao Shuli's works.

Shanxi writers and young authors are known for writing short stories. The characteristics of these short stories are: truly short, generally within seven or eight thousand words; creating realistic images of peasants, good at closely combining portrait descriptions and psychological portrayals; the language is simple, lively, and mass-oriented; the development of the story suits the tastes of the peasants, and it has a healthy, optimistic, and humorous style.

The advantages of the "Literary Gazette's" approach are: it strengthens the connection with local writers, publications, and readers; it also promotes the development of local literary review work.

    永远和人民在一起
    ——介绍“文艺报”的“山西文艺特辑”
    石美
    我国文学艺术的花朵开遍各地。在各省和自治区，文艺领导工作都积累了不少成功的经验，作家们创作了许许多多优秀的作品，工农唱出了千百万首豪迈的歌。对这些，应给予及时的推广和热情的评论。为此，“文艺报”特派了编辑人员到太原，在山西文艺界的帮助之下，编了“山西文艺特辑”。这个特辑发表在本月11日出版的第十一期“文艺报”上。“山西文艺特辑”共包括了李束为的“永远和人民在一起”、陈笑雨的“写下最新最美的诗篇”、巴人的“略谈赵树理同志的创作”和报道“民族的艺术风格，浓郁的生活气息——座谈‘火花’上的短篇小说”、“让山西省文艺思想战线上遍插红旗！”以及短篇作品评论等十四篇文章。“文艺报”编者按写道：“我们认为，山西文艺工作者和文艺刊物密切联系群众的精神，是值得学习的。”山西的许多作家和青年作者是在解放区土生土长的，在党的领导下，参加过对敌斗争，减租减息，土地改革和整风运动，有和群众同甘共苦的经历。解放后，经常深入农村，不少人在农村里担负了工作。这是他们能够创作出好的作品的基础。巴人的文章论述了“小二黑结婚”、“李有才板话”、“李家庄的变迁”、“三里湾”所反映的生活面貌，时代跳动的脉搏和作者所表现的主题思想的发展，作者指出赵树理同志善于创造正面的积极人物，“而且总是把这些正面的积极人物的运命，同中国人民革命斗争的步调相结合，以取得胜利为结局”，作者还论述了赵树理作品的民族风格问题。
    山西作家、青年作者以写短篇小说见长。这些短篇小说的特色是：名副其实的短，一般都在七、八千字以内；创造了真实的农民形象，善于把肖像描写和心理刻划紧密结合起来；语言通俗生动、群众化，故事展开适合农民的胃口，具有乐观主义的健康的情趣和幽默的格调。
    “文艺报”这样做法的好处是：加强了和地方作家、刊物、读者的联系；对地方文艺评论工作的发展，也起了推动作用。
