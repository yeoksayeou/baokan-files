Reports Compiled by Our Newspaper. Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Cairo News: The Algerian National Liberation Front issued a call on June 9th to the Algerian National Liberation Army and the people, demanding that they intensify the Algerian national liberation war.

    This call was issued by the military leaders of the Unified Guidance and Executive Committee of the Liberation Front, which is the highest body of the front, and has been holding meetings in Cairo for the past few days.

    In the call, the military leaders asked the Algerian people not to be deceived by the speeches made by De Gaulle during his visit to Algeria. He called on the army and the people to severely strike the enemy, closely monitor the enemy, and not let go of any opportunity to strike the enemy.

    He said that the only thing that can save France is to recognize the independence of Algeria, and the Algerian people are determined to strive for independence at any cost.

    On the same day, Abbas of the Algerian National Liberation Front told a reporter from the Cairo "Evening News" that "as long as De Gaulle pursues his imperialist policy, there will never be peace in the Middle East." He said that the Algerian National Liberation Army will continue its armed struggle against French imperialism until Algeria achieves freedom and independence.

    Abbas said that the Algerian question will be raised again at the next UN General Assembly, and the Algerian people will rely on the support of the delegations from Asian and African countries. He also said that Algeria does not need volunteer personnel, but only financial assistance.

    According to another New York dispatch: Yazid, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front to the United Nations, told a reporter from United Press International on June 9th that he vehemently condemned De Gaulle's conspiracy to "integrate" Algeria with France.

    Yazid emphasized that the Algerian National Liberation Front and all Muslim residents will resist any elections presided over by France in Algeria.

    He said that although the French have a few Algerian puppets, it seems that their puppet reserves are not enough. These puppets may be elected with the support of French paratroopers, but they will receive neither the respect of the Algerian people nor the respect of the French people.

    Yazid said that there will be elections in Algeria in the future, but those will be genuine elections organized by the Algerian government in an independent Algeria. French immigrants who have obtained Algerian citizenship will have full and equal rights and obligations, and they can also participate in elections.

    Yazid finally emphasized that "the French government must recognize this fact: the trend of the Algerian people striving for independence cannot be stopped. Only the independence of Algeria can end the war. If De Gaulle cannot face this reality, it will mean that the war will expand to the entire North Africa."

    Yazid said that Algeria will form a North African federation with Tunisia and Morocco. He said that consultations are underway regarding the establishment of an Algerian provisional government and a North African parliament.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线军事领导人
    号召军民狠狠打击法殖民军
    不惜代价争取独立　决不上戴高乐的当
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：开罗消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线9日向阿尔及利亚民族解放军和人民发出号召，要求他们加紧进行阿尔及利亚民族解放战争。
    这项号召是这个解放阵线的统一指导和执行委员会的军事领导人发布的，统一指导和执行委员会是这个阵线的最高机构，它在过去几天来一直在开罗举行会议。
    军事领导人在号召书中要求阿尔及利亚人民不要被戴高乐在访问阿尔及利亚期间发表的演说所欺骗。他号召军队和人民狠狠地打击敌人，密切注视敌人，不要放过任何打击敌人的机会。
    他说，唯一能够拯救法国的是承认阿尔及利亚的独立，阿尔及利亚人决心不惜以任何代价来争取独立。
    同一天，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的阿巴斯对开罗“晚报”记者说，“只要戴高乐奉行他的帝国主义政策，中东就永远不会有和平”。他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军将继续对法帝国主义进行武装斗争，直到阿尔及利亚获得自由和独立的时候为止。
    阿巴斯说，在下一届联合国大会上，阿尔及利亚问题将再一次提出来，阿尔及利亚人将依靠亚非各国的代表团的支持。他还说，阿尔及利亚并不需要志愿人员，而只需要财政援助。
    另据纽约消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻联合国代表雅齐德9日对合众国际社记者发表谈话，猛烈谴责戴高乐企图把阿尔及利亚同法国“合为一体”的阴谋。
    雅齐德强调指出，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线和全体穆斯林居民将抵制法国在阿尔及利亚所主持的任何选举。
    他说，虽然法国人拥有少数的阿尔及利亚傀儡，但是看来似乎他们的傀儡后备也不够用了。这些傀儡可能会在法国伞兵的支持下当选，但是他们将既得不到阿尔及利亚人民的尊重，也得不到法国人民的尊重。
    雅齐德说，将来在阿尔及利亚是会有选举的，但是那将是由阿尔及利亚政府在独立的阿尔及利亚所组织的真正的选举。凡是取得了阿尔及利亚公民籍的法国移民将有充分而平等的权利和义务，他们也可以参加选举。
    雅齐德最后着重指出，“法国政府必须认清这个事实：阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的潮流是阻挡不住的。只有阿尔及利亚的独立才能结束战争。如果戴高乐不能面对这个现实，那就将意味着战争将扩大到整个北非。”
    雅齐德说，阿尔及利亚将同突尼斯、摩洛哥结成北非联邦。他说，关于成立阿尔及利亚临时政府和北非议会问题的协商正在进行中。
