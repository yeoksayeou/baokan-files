　　Liberate Stagnant Materials in Warehouses
    Hunan Province's Industrial Enterprises Conduct Large-Scale Warehouse Clearance
    (Our report) According to the New Hunan Daily: In order to solve the problems of raw materials and mechanical equipment in the development of local industries, a mass movement to clear warehouses and utilize waste materials is being widely carried out in enterprises throughout Hunan Province.
    Various parts of Hunan Province have mobilized the masses to clear warehouses, so that stagnant raw materials and equipment can quickly participate in socialist construction. Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Changde and other regions have successively established warehouse clearing committees and leading groups, set up offices, and conducted detailed studies and deployments on the clearing targets, scope, time, and material allocation and handling. The Party committees of many enterprises personally took charge, vigorously mobilized the masses, organized warehouse clearing work teams and shock brigades, closely integrated with the rectification movement, and launched a warehouse clearing high tide. Many units have exposed many large and small, open and secret warehouses, cleared out a large number of useful equipment and materials, and also discovered many backlog and waste phenomena. Some units, under the influence of the thinking of "preparing more than needed" and departmentalism, caused many useful materials to sleep in the warehouse. For example, many materials in Hengyang Machinery Factory exceeded the reserve quota, and this year's inventory of steel and pig iron each exceeded 2,000 tons. Changsha Xinsheng Machinery Factory produced circular saws and four-wheeled trailers this year, and the amount of round steel needed was not large. The actual consumption in the first quarter was only 28 tons, but the inventory at the end of the quarter reached 148 tons, which could be used for 15 months. The total value of materials backlog in 21 basic construction and construction and installation enterprises in the province in the first quarter of this year also reached 3.39 million yuan. The Transportation Department's Ship Repair Factory has an inventory of more than 400 tons of steel plates, of which 20 tons of boiler steel plates are not needed for the time being. Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory produced gas generators this year. In addition to the shortage of a small number of materials, there are more than 90 tons of other types of steel that are not suitable or surplus.
    During the warehouse clearing movement, it was also found that the material management of many enterprises was very chaotic, the leaders were unclear about the "family property," the inventory materials did not match the books, the material requisition and return system was unsound, and the raw material consumption quota was too high. Many materials and equipment have deteriorated or been lost due to poor management. During the clearing of the Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory, it was found that there were 127 cases of steel exceeding 500 kilograms that did not match the books, and the total steel lost and gained reached 179 tons. Most of the waste materials of Shaoyang Automobile Repair Factory were stacked in the open field, and the waste steel balls and steel bowls fell into the puddles, unattended. In the past, this factory believed that the raw materials were insufficient. The raw materials and equipment cleared out by the masses this time, in addition to being sufficient for their own needs, had another 40 tons that could be transferred to other places.
    While clearing the warehouses, many units also widely carried out activities to save waste and use substitutes. The workers of Hunan Agricultural Machinery Factory established a waste collection patrol car, and often sent special personnel to push it to various workshops to collect waste and tail materials, and then classify and process them for utilization. The Changsha Water Pump Factory lacked machine tool equipment, and the workers proposed the slogan of "reviving waste machine tools and renovating old machine tools." One old machine tool was sawn into two, and the seat surface of the waste gantry planer was modified into a 1.75-meter large planer. A two-meter faceplate lathe, which used to take six months to complete, was made in two months. The factory basically overcame the difficulty of insufficient equipment.

### 解放仓库中的呆滞物资  湖南全省工业企业大清仓库

　　解放仓库中的呆滞物资
    湖南全省工业企业大清仓库
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：为了解决发展地方工业中的原材料和机械设备问题，一个群众性的清理仓库和利用废旧物资运动正在湖南省各企业中普遍开展。
    湖南省各地发动群众清理仓库，使呆滞的原材料和设备迅速参加社会主义建设。长沙、衡阳、邵阳、常德等地区先后成立了清仓委员会和清仓领导小组，设立了办公室，对清理对象、范围、时间以及物资的调配处理作了详细研究和部署。许多企业的党委亲自挂帅，大力发动群众，组织了清仓工作队和突击队，密切结合整风运动，掀起了清仓高潮。不少单位揭发出许多大大小小的、公开和不公开的仓库，清出了大量的有用器材和物资，同时也发现了不少积压和浪费现象。有些单位在“宽打窄用、有备无患”和本位主义的思想支配下，使许多有用物资在仓库里睡大觉。如衡阳机械厂许多材料都超过储备定额，今年库存钢和生铁各有二千多吨。长沙新生机械厂今年生产圆锯机、四轮拖车等产品，需用的元钢数量并不多，一季度实际耗用只有二十八吨，但季末库存量却达一百四十八吨，可供十五个月之用。全省二十一个基本建设和建筑安装企业，今年第一季积压的物资总值也达三百三十九万余元。交通厅船舶修理厂库存钢板四百多吨，其中有二十吨锅炉钢板暂时根本用不上。湖南农业机械厂今年生产煤气机，除少数物资材料供应不足外，其他根本不适用和多余的型钢就有九十多吨。
    清仓运动中，还发现许多企业的物资管理工作非常混乱，领导对“家底”不清，库存材料与账面不符，领料、退料制度不健全，原材料消耗定额偏高。许多材料和设备由于管理不善，有的变质了，丢失了。衡阳矿山机械厂清理中，查出在五百公斤以上的钢材与账面不符的有一百二十七笔，盘亏、盘盈的钢材共达一百七十九吨。邵阳汽车修理厂大部分废旧料堆放在露天场中，废旧钢珠、钢碗倒在水洼里，无人保管。过去这个厂认为原材料不够，这次群众清理出的原材料和设备，除足供自己需用外，还有四十吨可以外调。
    在清仓的同时，许多单位还广泛展开了节约利废和使用代用品的活动。湖南农业机械厂的职工建立了废料收集巡回车，经常派专人推到各车间收集废料、尾料，再分类整理，加工利用。长沙水泵厂机床设备不足，职工们提出让“废机床复活、旧机床翻新”的口号，用一部旧机床锯断做成两部，把废龙门刨床的座子面修改成一点七五公尺的大刨床，两个月制成了过去需要六个月才能完成的二米花盘车床。全厂基本上克服了设备不足的困难。
