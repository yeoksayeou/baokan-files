Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: "Resolutely implement the general line and become 'four-dare' youth who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to create." This was the common oath made by 25,000 youth from all walks of life in the capital at a rally held in Zhongshan Park tonight to promote and implement the general line.

Zhongshan Park was brightly lit tonight, and everyone was excited. The youth brought many reports of creation and innovation from various fronts. The corridors and woods were plastered with thousands of letters of determination and challenge, demonstrating the youth's efforts to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said at the meeting that the general line of socialist construction is the lighthouse for the advancement of Chinese youth. The youth across the country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and regard the realization of the general line as their most sacred duty. He said that the youth must break with all mysterious, conservative, and superstitious backward ideas. As long as it conforms to the general direction of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, they must be resolute and courageous, boldly create, and become new people who are both creative and disciplined, who charge forward for the truth, and who hold high the banner of revolution and advancement. They should use all their strength to completely change our country's backwardness and make it one of the richest and greatest socialist countries in the world.

Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, called on the youth of the city to take immediate action, everyone to be a propagandist, everyone to be educated, everyone to dare to create, and everyone to plant a red flag, and contribute all their strength to the socialist construction of the capital.

After Hu Keshi and Wang Zhaohua spoke, youth representatives attending the meeting, including worker Zhang Baifa, Liu Yugui, agricultural cooperative member Sun Ruidong, salesperson Zhao Weixin, and athlete Chen Jingkai, ran to the rostrum one after another to express their determination to implement the general line. Students from Peking University also recited poems.

After the speeches, the entire venue immediately boiled over. The songs of "Confide in the Party and plant red flags, dare to think, dare to do, and dare to create..." rose and fell. The young workers were vying to see the big-character posters, letters of determination, and good news reports around the Altar of Land and Grain, which became a stage for heroes to compete. The youth of the state-owned Beijing Radio Factory shouted that they would "use their brains, offer treasures, and be the vanguards of the technical revolution! Be the shock force for publicizing and implementing the general line!" Today, they reported to the conference the good news of the first high-speed electronic computer in China assembled two days ago.

The youth also performed more than 100 wonderful programs of various kinds, which they wrote and performed themselves to promote the general line, at the meeting. (Attached pictures)

    人人敢创造  个个插红旗
    首都青年誓师贯彻总路线
    新华社2日讯  “坚决贯彻执行总路线，做敢想、敢说、敢做、敢创造的‘四敢’青年。”这是首都各界两万五千名青年今晚在中山公园举行的宣传、贯彻总路线誓师大会上的共同誓言。
    中山公园今晚灯火辉煌，人人兴奋。青年们从各个战线带来了许多创造、革新的喜报。走廊和树林里张贴着表现青年们鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的数以千计的决心书和挑战书。
    共青团中央书记处书记胡克实在大会上说，社会主义建设总路线是我国青年前进的灯塔，全国青年热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，把实现总路线作为自己最神圣的义务。他说，青年们要和一切神秘、保守和迷信落后的思想实行决裂，只要符合多快好省的总方向，就要坚决勇敢，大胆创造，成为既有创造性又有纪律性，为真理冲锋陷阵、高举革命和先进旗帜的新人，用自己的全副力量，使我们的国家完全改变落后面貌，成为世界上最富强最伟大的社会主义国家之一。
    共青团北京市委第一书记王照华在讲话中号召全市青年立即行动起来，人人做宣传、人人受教育，人人敢创造，个个插红旗，为首都的社会主义建设贡献全部力量。
    胡克实、王照华讲话后，参加大会的青年代表，工人张百发、刘玉桂，农业社社员孙瑞东、售货员赵维新、运动健将陈镜开等人先后跑上主席台表示他们贯彻总路线的决心。北京大学学生还朗诵了诗歌。
    讲话结束后，全场立即沸腾起来。“向党交心插红旗，敢想敢做敢创造……”的歌声此起彼落。青年工人们，在社稷坛周围互相争看大字报、决心书和喜报，这里成了英雄的比武台。国营北京有线电厂的青年们，高呼要“人人动脑，个个献宝，做技术革命的尖兵！做宣传和贯彻总路线的突击手！”今天他们以两天前装配成功的我国第一台快速电子计算机向大会报喜。
    青年们在大会上还表演了他们自编自演的一百多个宣传总路线的各种精彩节目。（附图片）
