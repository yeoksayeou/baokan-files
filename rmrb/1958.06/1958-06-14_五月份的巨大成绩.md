Editorial: Great Achievements of May

    The National Bureau of Statistics' report on the implementation of the national economic plan for May is a very convincing material. This material is almost entirely composed of numbers, but these numbers are not boring, because they shine with the light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, indicating that human subjective initiative can produce magical powers like summoning wind and rain.

    This power was initially demonstrated in the actual production results of May: industrial production increased by 46% compared to the same month last year; investment in capital construction increased by 54.1% compared to the same month last year; according to incomplete statistics, more than 520,000 local industrial units have been built and put into production in twenty provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; this year's summer grain output is expected to increase by about 20 billion jin compared to last year. Anyone who pays attention to economic development and has some economic common sense understands that every 1% increase in industrial production represents a huge absolute figure, and we increased by 46% compared to the same month last year. Last year's total grain output increased by 5 billion jin (2.5 million tons) compared to the previous year, while this year's summer harvest alone will increase by 20 billion jin (10 million tons) compared to last year. And the sown area of summer grain only accounts for a little more than a quarter of the total grain sown area in our country.

    China is still the China of last year, the working class is still the working class of last year, the peasants are still the peasants of last year, and except for the newly born babies this year, the 600 million people are still the 600 million people of last year. Why is this year's production able to advance at a much higher speed than last year? The key lies in whether to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the 12 million industrial workers and the 500 million peasants, whether to strive for the upstream, and whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in everything. In 1957, there was no emphasis on boosting enthusiasm, no emphasis on striving for the upstream, and China also advanced, but not quickly. In 1958, emphasis was placed on boosting enthusiasm and striving for the upstream among the 600 million people, and China advanced at an unusually high speed, creating a prosperous situation of unprecedented development of productive forces. This shows how great a fundamental difference there is between whether to boost enthusiasm and whether to strive for the upstream.

    Marxists have always believed that material production is primary and human consciousness is secondary. But Marxists have always believed that human consciousness—human subjective initiative—can react on material production, and once this initiative is fully exerted, it can greatly promote the development of production. The soaring enthusiasm of the liberated 600 million people represents this enormous initiative. If the correct line and policies are adopted, this enthusiasm will become an inexhaustible material force.

    The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has opened up a broad road for fully exerting the enthusiasm of the 600 million people. As a result, it has begun to change and continues to change the face of our country in a short period of time, bringing us into the great era where "one day equals twenty years."

    Some people have not recognized this point, that is, they have not recognized the 600 million people, that is, they have not recognized the decisive factor of the 12 million industrial workers plus the 500 million peasants. Therefore, they always adopt a half-believing or skeptical "wait-and-see" attitude towards the Great Leap Forward and the high tide. Now let them take a look at the achievements of May this year. With the fact that industrial production has increased by 46% placed before them, they should change their views and boost their enthusiasm and leap forward with everyone! As for some "reckoning after the autumn harvest" factions, let them complain and blame others. Ruthless facts have thrown them far behind! No matter what the situation is after the autumn harvest, the 20 billion jin increase in summer grain production this year is always 5 billion jin more than the 15 billion jin increase in total grain production last year. This account is very clear.

    The huge production achievements in May this year are actually just the result of the efforts of the previous months. In the situation where the high tide is rising day by day, there is no doubt that the production records for the next seven months will continue to increase. Facts speak louder than words. We will continue to see that under the brilliant illumination of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, our country's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings will advance at a faster pace.

### 五月份的巨大成绩

    五月份的巨大成绩
    国家统计局公布的5月份国民经济计划执行情况报告，是一个很有说服力的材料。这个材料差不多全部是由数字构成的，然而这些数字并不枯燥，因为它闪耀着党的社会主义建设总路线的光芒，它表明人的主观能动性可以产生像呼风唤雨一样的神奇的力量。
    这个力量初步地在5月份的生产实绩中表现出来：工业生产比去年同月增长了46％；基本建设投资额比去年同月增长54.1％；据不完全统计，二十个省、市、自治区已经建成投入生产的地方工业单位有五十二万个以上；今年夏收粮食产量预计将比去年增加二百亿斤左右。稍为注意经济发展和有一些经济常识的人都懂得，工业生产每增加1％，它的绝对数字都是巨大的，而我们在上月份比去年同月增多了46％。去年全年的粮食产量比前年增加了五十亿斤（二百五十万吨），今年只夏收即比去年增加二百亿斤（一千万吨）。而夏收粮食的播种面积只占我国全部粮食播种面积的四分之一多一些。
    中国还是去年的中国，工人阶级还是去年的工人阶级，农民还是去年的农民，除了今年新生的婴儿以外，六亿人民还是去年的六亿人民，为什么今年的生产就能以比去年高得多的速度前进呢？关键就在于是不是把一千二百万产业工人和五亿多农民的干劲鼓足，是不是力争了上游，是不是处处多快好省。1957年没有强调鼓足干劲，没有强调力争上游，中国也前进了，但是前进得不快。1958年在六亿人民中强调了鼓足干劲，强调了力争上游，中国就以一种异乎寻常的高速度前进，就出现了一个前所未有的生产力大发展的兴旺局面。由此可见，是否鼓足干劲，是否力争上游，有着多么大的原则性的区别。
    马克思主义者从来认为物质生产是第一性的，人的意识是第二性的。但是马克思主义者从来也认为人的意识——人的主观能动性能够反作用于物质生产，这种能动性一旦充分发挥出来，就能够极大地推动生产的发展。解放了的六亿人民的冲天干劲就代表着这种巨大的能动性。如果采取正确的方针路线，这种干劲就会成为无穷无尽的物质力量。
    党的社会主义建设总路线，为充分发挥六亿人民的干劲开辟了宽阔的道路，结果在短短的时间里就开始改变了并且继续改变着我国的面貌，使我们进入了“一天等于二十年”的伟大时期。
    有一些人没有认识到这一点，也就是说没有认识到六亿人民、就是说没有认识到一千二百万产业工人加上五亿多农民这个决定性的因素。因而他们对于大跃进，对于高潮，总是采取一种半信半疑或将信将疑的“观潮”态度。现在就让他们来看看今年5月份的成绩吧。工业生产增长46％的事实摆在他们的面前，他们总应该改变自己的观点来鼓足干劲和大家一起跃进了吧！至于还有一些“秋后算账”派，就让他们去怨天尤人吧，无情的事实把他们远远地抛到后面了！不管秋后情况如何，今年夏收粮食增产二百亿斤总比去年全年粮食增产一百五十亿斤要多五十亿斤。这笔账是很清楚的。
    今年5月份的巨大的生产实绩，实际上还只是前几个月努力的成果。在高潮日日高的形势下，毫无疑问，今后七个月的生产纪录仍然会有增无减。事实胜于雄辩，我们还将继续看到在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的工农业生产和各项建设事业将以更快的速度前进。
