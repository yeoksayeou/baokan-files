    Contributions of a Kazakh Old Herdsman
    The Kazakh herder Abudu Alang of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's State-owned Gongnais Fine-Wool Sheep Farm, who grazed 352 ewes, produced 515 lambs, creating a new record of 147% lambing rate. Abudu Alang has 20 years of herding experience, and he has been a herder at the Gongnais Fine-Wool Sheep Farm for more than ten years. In 1954, the lambing rate of the sheep he herded reached more than 130%. This is the result of the combination of his 20 years of herding experience and new sheep management techniques. The sheep he herds can gain 100-130 grams of weight per sheep per day. For this, he has been repeatedly rated as a labor model of the Gongnais Fine-Wool Sheep Farm. Last year, he attended the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Conference of Advanced Agricultural, Forestry, Water Conservancy and Animal Husbandry Producers. This year he received an advanced producer medal, certificate, and bonus from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation.

    哈萨克族老牧人的贡献
    新疆维吾尔自治区国营巩乃斯种羊场的哈萨克牧工阿不都阿郎放牧的三百五十二只母羊，产了五百一十五只羊羔，创造了产羔率147％的新纪录。阿不都阿郎有二十年的放牧经验，他在巩乃斯种羊场担任牧工已有十几年了。1954年他放牧的羊群的产羔率达到了130％多。这是他二十年的放牧经验和新的羊群管理技术相结合的结果。他放牧的羊群每只羊每天能增加体重100—130克。为此他曾多次被评为巩乃斯种羊场的劳动模范，去年出席了新疆维吾尔自治区农林水牧先进生产者代表会议，今年获得农垦部颂发的先进生产者奖章、奖状和奖金。
