Iron Flowers Bloom, Molten Iron Flows
Hunan, Shanxi, and Shandong Widely Build Small and Medium-Sized Blast Furnaces

　　Changsha, June 6th (reported by our correspondent Luo Houren): Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, Hunan Province's local metallurgy industry has decided to abandon the ideology of "waiting for equipment" and pursuing modernization. It will adopt the method of starting small and growing large, combining indigenous and foreign methods to accelerate construction. This will increase the province's pig iron production this year by nearly two times compared to the original plan of over 300,000 tons. Currently, in addition to actively building over 300 small blast furnaces and medium-sized blast furnaces, the Hunan Provincial Department of Heavy Industry has decided to build another 2,000 small blast furnaces. Once these 2,300-plus blast furnaces of various sizes are all put into production, this year's pig iron production can reach 1 million tons, more than nine times the total pig iron production in 1957. Next year, it can reach 2 million tons.

　　More than half of the counties in Hunan Province have relatively abundant iron ore resources, and many places have a long history of indigenous iron smelting. The 300-plus iron smelting furnaces originally planned to be built this year in various places mostly use semi-mechanized or mechanized equipment, and this equipment must be manufactured by other provinces. Under the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in industries across the country, supply is facing difficulties and cannot meet the needs in time. Therefore, some places simply wait for machinery and equipment and are unwilling to think of other methods. After the Party Central Committee proposed the General Line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it illuminated everyone's eyes and it was decided to proceed from the current actual situation, abandon the plan of waiting for equipment, follow the route of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, focusing on small-scale indigenous iron smelting first, and appropriately develop medium-scale mechanized iron smelting. The two hundred-plus small blast furnaces under construction and the planned two thousand small blast furnaces will, in the absence of machinery and equipment at present, find ways to use water power and manpower to blow air, adopt indigenous smelting methods, and put them into production first. When equipment is available, machines will be installed to use power to blow air for production. This will greatly accelerate the construction speed.

　　According to Shanxi Daily: A massive, mass-based upsurge in the development of the iron and steel industry has emerged throughout Shanxi Province. A batch of small and medium-sized iron smelting blast furnaces and "indigenous blast furnaces" have been successively put into production, and a large number of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and "indigenous blast furnaces" are under construction.

　　This year, all sixty-nine counties and cities in Shanxi Province will build iron smelting plants. This year, 439 blast furnaces of various types will be built and put into production. Among these blast furnaces, there are fifteen 30- to 180-cubic-meter iron smelting blast furnaces, 141 small 3- to 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces, and hundreds of "indigenous blast furnaces" using indigenous smelting methods. The 30- to 180-cubic-meter iron smelting blast furnaces are directly responsible for construction and expansion by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry in various places. The 141 small blast furnaces are built by the counties themselves under the guidance of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry. The large number of "indigenous blast furnaces" are built by the counties and the handicraft system of each county under the guidance of the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Cooperative.

　　The total design capacity of these iron smelting blast furnaces (excluding indigenous blast furnaces) is 1 million tons of pig iron per year. It is estimated that 240,000 tons of pig iron can be produced this year. After all are built and put into production, they will not only basically meet the needs of the province's machinery manufacturing industry, but also create conditions for further large-scale development of the iron and steel industry and the construction of a strong iron and steel industrial network throughout the province.

　　Shanxi Province has a large iron ore reserve, which provides very favorable conditions for the development of the iron and steel industry. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, while comprehensively planning the province's local industrial development plan, have arranged the development of the iron and steel industry as an important part, and determined that the iron and steel industry should be developed on a large scale from this year onwards, and a strong iron and steel industrial network should be gradually built throughout the province.

　　Xinhua News Agency: Shandong Province, whose iron and steel industry foundation is extremely weak, strives to build more than 1,000 small blast furnaces and crucibles in more than 60 counties and cities with iron ore in June and July using various methods. This is the fighting goal put forward by the Shandong Provincial People's Committee at the small blast furnace iron smelting on-site meeting of 61 counties and cities held in the Lisheng Foundry Production Cooperative in Kouzhen, Laiwu County recently.

　　This year, while starting to prepare and build a batch of medium-sized iron and steel plants invested by the state, Shandong Province pays great attention to promoting and developing mass-based small blast furnaces and indigenous iron smelting funded by local self-raising. The advantages of developing this kind of small blast furnace are: less investment, simple equipment, and quick results. After the above-mentioned 1,000-plus small blast furnaces and indigenous furnaces are built, it is estimated that they can produce about 1,500 tons of pig iron per day, and a total of about 300,000 tons of iron can be produced by the end of the year.

　　The representatives of the counties and cities who participated in the Kouzhen on-site meeting, after visiting the production situation of a small blast furnace built by the Lisheng Foundry Cooperative with simple equipment that can smelt number two gray pig iron, unanimously believed that this method has set an example for the widespread development of small indigenous furnace iron smelting, thus dispelling the mystery of iron smelting for many people and reversing the ideas of "only wanting to do big things, not wanting to do small things," "reaching out to the top," and "watching and waiting." They said: They will immediately take action, mobilize all available manpower and material resources of the county, township, and commune, build furnaces as soon as possible and make them flow iron water, and ensure that small blast furnaces or indigenous furnaces bloom and bear fruit everywhere.

### 铁花怒放铁水奔流  湖南山西山东遍建中小型高炉

　　铁花怒放铁水奔流
    湖南山西山东遍建中小型高炉
    本报长沙6日电　记者罗厚仁报道：在总路线的光辉照耀下，湖南省的地方冶炼工业，决定抛弃“坐等设备”和追求现代化的思想，采取由小到大和土洋结合的办法，加快建设速度，可使今年全省的生铁产量比原计划的三十多万吨增长近两倍。现在各地除正在积极兴建三百多座矮小高炉和中型高炉外，湖南省重工业厅决定再建两千座矮高炉。这两千三百多座大小炼铁炉全部投入生产后，今年生铁产量就可达到一百万吨，将比1957年的生铁总产量增加九倍多，明年就可达到二百万吨。
    湖南省半数以上的县都有比较丰富的铁矿资源，很多地方对土法炼铁有悠久历史。今年各地原计划兴建的三百多座炼铁炉，大部分是用半机械或机械化的设备，而这些设备要靠外省制造。在目前全国各地工业都在大跃进情况下，供应发生困难，不能及时赶上需要。因此，有些地方就单纯坐等机器设备，不愿另想办法。这次党中央多快好省建设社会主义的总路线提出后，照亮了大家的眼睛，决定从当前的实际情况出发，抛弃坐等设备的打算，走多快好省的路线，着重先搞小型的土法炼铁，适当地发展中型的机械化的炼铁。正在兴建的两百多座矮小高炉和计划即着手兴建的两千座矮高炉，在目前没有机器设备的情况下，就设法利用水力和人力来鼓风，采取土法冶炼，先行投入生产；等有了设备的时候，再安装机器用动力来鼓风生产，这样即可大大地加快建设速度。
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：一个声势浩大的、群众性的发展钢铁工业的热潮，已在山西省各地普遍出现。一批中小型的炼铁高炉和“土高炉”陆续投入生产，大批的中小型高炉和“土高炉”正在加紧建设。
    今年山西全省六十九个县市都要建设炼铁厂，在今年内要建成并投入生产的各种类型的炼铁高炉就有四百三十九座。在这些高炉中有三十至一百八十立方公尺的炼铁高炉十五座，有三至十三立方公尺的小高炉一百四十一座，还有用土法进行冶炼的“土高炉”数百座。三十至一百八十立方公尺的炼铁高炉由山西省工业厅直接负责分别在各地新建和扩建；一百四十一座小高炉在山西省工业厅的指导下，由各县自建；大量的“土高炉”则在山西省手工业联社的指导下，由各县和各县的手工业系统负责建设。
    这些炼铁高炉（不包括土高炉）的设计能力总计是年产一百万吨生铁，预计在今年内就能够生产生铁二十四万吨，全部建成并投入生产后，不仅可以基本上满足全省机械制造工业的需要，而且将为进一步大规模地发展钢铁工业，在全省范围内建成强大的钢铁工业网创造条件。
    山西省的铁矿蕴藏量很大，发展钢铁工业有着非常有利的条件。中共山西省委和省人民委员会在全面规划全省地方工业发展计划的同时，把发展钢铁工业作为一项重要内容作了安排，确定今年起要大规模地发展钢铁工业，逐步地在全省范围内建设起强大的钢铁工业网。
    据新华社讯　钢铁工业基础极为薄弱的山东省，力争在6、7月间在六十多个有铁矿石的县、市内，采取多种多样的办法建起一千多个小高炉和坩埚。这是山东省人民委员会最近在莱芜县口镇利生翻砂生产合作社召开的六十一个县、市的小高炉炼铁现场会议上提出的奋斗目标。
    今年，山东省在着手筹建和兴建一批由国家投资的中型钢铁厂的同时，非常注意推广和发展由地方自筹资金开办的群众性的各式小高炉和土法炼铁。发展这种小高炉的好处在于：投资少、设备简单、收效快。上述一千多个小高炉和土炉建成后，预计每天可以生产生铁一千五百吨左右，到年底共可产铁三十万吨上下。
    参加口镇现场会议的各县、市的代表，在参观了利生翻砂社用简陋设备筑成的、能冶炼出二号灰口铁的一座小高炉的生产情况后，一致认为这种作法为普遍发展小土炉炼铁做出了样子，因此使不少人破除了对炼铁的神秘观念，扭转了“只想搞大的，不愿搞小的”、“伸手向上要”、“观望等待”等想法。他们表示：要立即行动起来，发动县、乡、社一切可以发动的人力和物力，尽速筑炉并使其流出铁水，务使小高炉或土炉遍地开花结果。
