Shandong's Anti-Drought Struggle Advances Victoriously
Mass Mobilization Ensures Timely Sowing of Wheat Stubble Land and Vigorous Growth of Spring Seedlings

Jinan, June 16th (Our Newspaper) – The heroic people of Shandong, who defied Heaven and defeated the Dragon King by wresting a good wheat harvest from the drought, are now advancing victoriously, launching a tenacious struggle against drought to rush planting and protect seedlings.

Since late May, Shandong Province has had an army of over fifteen million people fighting the drought every day. According to statistics, while irrigating over 12 million mu of wheat with grain-filling water and yellowing water, they have also planted over 10 million mu of spring fields with water, basically completing the sowing task; and irrigated over 4 million mu of spring seedlings. In the past ten days or so, the province has found more than 57,000 mountain springs, which is ten times the number of original springs. In the next short half-month to twenty days, the people of the province will go all out to launch a concentrated effort to fight drought, rush planting, and protect seedlings, to ensure that all 60 million mu of wheat stubble land are sown in a timely manner, and to ensure the vigorous growth of 80 million mu of spring seedlings. At the same time, due to the continuous development of the drought and the increasing difficulty of water sources, coupled with the urgency of time and the shortage of labor, the future anti-drought struggle will inevitably be more arduous. Will we bow our heads to Heaven and be overwhelmed by the drought? Or will we advance victoriously, overwhelm the drought, and seize a bumper harvest? This question has been sharply placed before the Party committees at all levels and the people of the province.

"The less it rains, the more motivated we are," "Ten parts drought, a hundredfold determination; guarantee the plan, not reduce a single jin!" Under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the broad masses of Shandong Province have adopted a heroic attitude in the face of severe tests. Many areas have proposed not only to ensure that they can be planted, but also to plant earlier and better than in previous years, and to standardize sowing. Now, this anti-drought movement, centered on rushing planting and protecting seedlings, is rapidly unfolding in various places. The Tai'an Special District has rushed to plant more than 1.1 million mu of summer corn, accounting for more than 70% of the planned planting area.

    山东抗旱斗争乘胜前进
    全民动员保证麦茬地适时播种春苗生长旺盛
    本报济南16日电　藐视天公，气死龙王，从干旱中夺得小麦丰收的英雄的山东人民，正乘胜挺进，展开了抗旱抢种保苗的顽强斗争。
  从5月下旬以来，山东省每天都有一支一千五百余万人的大军在同干旱斗争。据统计，在浇小麦灌浆水、麦黄水一千二百多万亩的同时，还水种春田一千多万亩，基本上完成了播种任务；浇春苗四百多万亩，全省在最近十多天内又找到五万七千多个山泉，等于过去原有山泉的十倍。在今后短短的半月到二十天之内，全省人民将全力以赴，突击抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗，以保证六千万亩麦茬地全部适时播种，保证八千万亩春苗生长旺盛。同时，由于旱情持续发展、水源日趋困难；加上时间紧迫，劳力紧张，今后的抗旱斗争也必将更为艰巨。是向天公低头、被干旱压倒呢？还是乘胜前进，压倒干旱夺取丰收呢？这个问题已尖锐地摆在各级党委和全省人民的面前。
      “越不下雨，干劲越足”、“十分旱情，百倍决心；保证计划，不减一斤！”在党的总路线振奋鼓舞之下，山东省广大群众在严重的考验面前采取了英雄的态度。许多地区提出不仅保证种得上，而且要比往年种得早、种得好，做到播种规格化。现在，这个以抢种保苗为中心的抗旱运动正在各地迅速展开。泰安专区已抢种夏玉米一百一十多万亩，占计划播种面积的70％以上。
