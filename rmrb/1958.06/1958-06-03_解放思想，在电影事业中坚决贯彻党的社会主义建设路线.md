After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, especially since the anti-waste, anti-Rightist conservatism movement and the nationwide leap forward in agriculture and industry, the film industry has seen new developments. Under the leadership of the Party, the 60,000-strong film workforce across the country, with unprecedented vigor, is closely coordinating with the political agenda to serve socialist construction. In film production, distribution, and mechanical production, they are all exerting their utmost efforts to achieve a great leap forward and realize the slogan of "changing the face of the industry in three years." The number of films produced this year will double or even more than double that of last year. The production of large-scale films (including art films) this year will reach 100, with costs reduced by more than 30%, and production time shortened by more than one-third. The number of screenings will increase significantly, with audience attendance reaching 3 billion (compared to 2 billion last year). The total output value of the machinery industry will increase by 60%, striving to add new products and improve existing ones to meet the needs of screening and production equipment. The broad masses of film workers are breaking through layers of restrictions and various limitations with unstoppable momentum, overcoming Right-leaning conservative thinking, and continuously setting new records and making new creations.

Recently, we conducted "theoretical discussions" and used "theory to guide practice" to further comprehensively examine the film work. Although the achievements of the film industry are primary, the shortcomings and errors are serious. These mainly include: the business being divorced from politics, weak ideological and political work, and serious bourgeois ideology in business and artistic creation. There is also dogmatism, a tendency to value foreign things over domestic ones, a failure to proceed from China's reality, and a slavish imitation of foreign things, lacking originality. The development of the film industry has a relatively serious Right-leaning conservative ideology, failing to implement the line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and to exploit all potential, instead opting for "less, slower, worse, and more expensive," which to a considerable extent hindered the enthusiasm of all parties and caused the film industry to lag behind the requirements of the Party, the state, and the broad masses of the people. In recent years, thanks to the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, although no major errors have been committed, the film industry has taken many detours due to the aforementioned shortcomings and errors, failing to fully play the role that film should have in promoting the Party's policies, socialist transformation, socialist construction, and the cultural life of the people. Recently, we have clarified that "politics is the commander, is the soul," strengthened political and ideological work, used politics to drive business, resolutely broken superstitions, emancipated the mind, resolutely overcome the errors of dogmatism, overcome bourgeois ideology in business, and strived to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the film industry. It is imperative that politics be the commander, that the film industry actively serve politics, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialist construction. It is imperative to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, mobilize all positive factors, and develop the film industry. It is imperative to proceed from the 600 million people, face the vast Chinese audience (especially the broad masses of farmers and workers), and create new films with communist ideological content and communist style in truly national forms that are loved by the audience. It is imperative to strengthen the leadership of the Party, and under the premise of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, combine central and local initiatives, combine large, medium, and small scales, and combine cultural departments with business departments and mass organizations, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties in the film industry and fully exert the tremendous role of film in the cause of socialist construction.

To mobilize all positive factors and run the film industry in a "more, faster, better, and more economical" manner, we must break all shackles, change the existing system, delegate authority, strengthen the Party's leadership over the film industry, and let the local areas be the main organizers of the film industry. The transformation of the film industry left over from old China was basically completed in 1953, but the active and vigorous development of the film industry has not progressed very quickly. We once mistakenly attempted to create a "large film village." Although this error was quickly and timely corrected by the Party, we did not pay attention to the fact that the film industry should also combine central and local initiatives, and combine large, medium, and small scales. We overemphasized the particularity and technicality of film, as if it could only be done well by a few "insiders." At the same time, we overemphasized vertical leadership and did not respect the leadership of local Party committees and governments, so that production, distribution, and screening were all excessively concentrated in the central government. In terms of equipment, we also excessively demanded large-scale, modern facilities, resulting in a waste of state investment. In short, we overemphasized business, art, and technology, while neglecting politics. This erroneous guiding ideology seriously hampered the development of the film industry. Of course, it was appropriate to be relatively centralized when transforming the film industry left over from old China, and the development of the socialist film industry should also be planned, and film has its own particularity, but the centralization time should not be too long, the centralized authority should not be too much, and the particularity of film should not be overemphasized. Now, we resolutely change this policy and practice of excessive concentration, and implement delegation to local areas and bloom everywhere. The film studios and machinery factories originally directly under the central government, except for the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, are all handed over to local areas. Film production advocates simplification and small scale, and large, medium, and small scales should be developed simultaneously. The centralized management of film distribution by the central government is changed, and it is handed over to provinces (cities) and autonomous regions. The investment in screening units by the state is changed to local investment, and the establishment of rural film projection teams by cooperatives themselves is promoted. In this way, all positive factors can be mobilized to accelerate the development of the film industry.

Film is a very powerful weapon for publicizing the Party's policies and encouraging the broad masses of people. It can use artistic images to publicize policies and ideas, promote science and technology, and even more realistically reflect the face of our great national construction and the noble spiritual outlook of the heroic people. The facts of the past few years have fully demonstrated the role of film. However, whether film can correctly shoulder such a task, whether it can correctly produce good and inspiring films, in addition to strengthening the Party's leadership over the film industry, and that politics should become the commander of the film industry, the key issue lies in whether the artists and technicians in the film industry team, especially the film production team, are both "red and expert." Over the past eight years, the film artists and technicians in our country have been educated through multiple political movements, especially through the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the criticism of Hu Feng's reactionary ideas under the personal leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and ideological transformation has been achieved. However, this ideological transformation work is far from being finally completed. Since the Party put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" the year before last and the Party carried out rectification last year, the bourgeois ideology exposed by film workers is relatively serious. After the anti-Rightist struggle, there has been a clear understanding in ideology and politics, but this issue has not been resolved in business ideology. Since most of the film artists and technicians are bourgeois intellectuals, due to their long-term neglect of politics and separation from the masses, their bourgeois world outlook is often stubbornly expressed through artistic images. Therefore, it is impossible to ask them to produce films with truly high ideological and artistic quality that educate the people with communist ideas, and it is impossible to ask them to quickly create films that reflect the great struggles, noble ideological qualities, bold and unrestrained emotions, and countless new people and new things of the broad masses of working people today. The construction of a new type of proletarian film team still depends on training and building an army, and still depends on them (the original and new ones) combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and absorbing nourishment from the life and struggle of the masses. Only when they are tempered in the magnificent life and struggle of the masses can good films be produced. Therefore, in order to better transform this team, we will, on the one hand, send personnel to go down to the grassroots and immerse themselves in life, and on the other hand, organize artists and technicians to adopt a relatively rapid working method to shoot films reflecting the current great life. Also, through the shooting of films, we will go deep into factories, rural areas, and companies, contact the workers, peasants, and soldiers, understand the life of the masses, and accelerate our own transformation. Strive to build a proletarian film team more quickly. At the same time, in film production, film artistic creation continues to resolutely implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," enrich the themes and styles of films, create the national forms of film art more boldly, and strive to implement the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism advocated by Chairman Mao, expressing our era and people, and expressing the working class and communist style.

Implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" to run the film industry. We believe that the production business should be decentralized, and each province (city) and autonomous region should run film studios. In addition to a small number of provinces and cities where film studios directly under the central government are transferred to local management, most provinces (cities) and autonomous regions without film studios should quickly realize the goal of "each province (city, autonomous region) has a film studio." Starting this year, under the principle of diligence and frugality in running enterprises, small and simple film studios should be established first, and some newsreels and scientific educational films mainly reflecting the socialist construction of the province should be started. Starting next year, film technology equipment should be quickly installed in batches, and starting next year, film studios in provinces (cities) and autonomous regions with conditions will gradually shoot art films. Strive to generally produce newsreels, scientific educational films, and art films during the second five-year plan period or more, except for individual regions. These films serve the construction business, these films may truly be films that are rich in local flavor and national characteristics, and are "a hundred flowers bloom" and "a myriad of purples and reds." On the other hand, the original film studios should be appropriately expanded and professional film studios established using existing conditions in the past few years to promote the upsurge of the film production business. In this way, in about ten years, the scale of the film industry can meet the needs of a strong motherland. The output of films each year will be greatly increased, and it will not be tens of art films and two or three hundred newsreels and other films, but hundreds of art films and more other films. There are three main problems in developing the film industry in this way: cadres, equipment, and film supply. The cadre problem can be cultivated and trained in large numbers. The equipment relies on the existing film machinery industry to produce and supply. As for the film problem, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is already actively preparing and arranging. Can the funding problem be solved? It is easier to solve it by decentralizing it like this. It is by no means without difficulties to develop the film production business in this way, with all-round development and blooming everywhere, but we believe that these difficulties can be overcome.

We believe that while developing the film production business, we should also vigorously develop the screening business to meet the requirements of the broad masses of the people. Although we have more than 10,000 screening units (only 700 before liberation), and the audience last year was 2 billion, 80% of the county towns do not have cinemas, and only a very small number of projection teams in the vast rural areas. On average, the rural population can only see movies less than twice a year, and film screenings are far from playing the role they should play. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop, and the development policy should be to have cinemas in counties and projection teams in townships in ten years or more. Strive to have cinemas in 90% of county towns and one projection team in three townships within five years. If this requirement is met, residents of small and medium-sized county towns can see movies ten times a year, and farmers can see movies six to eight times a year. Cinemas are run by local governments, and projection teams are mainly run by agricultural cooperatives or by themselves. In this way, the state's funds can be saved, and film can be gradually popularized. The specifications of cinemas can be reduced. Except for new cinemas in large and medium-sized cities, the existing auditoriums or old houses in general county towns can be renovated and used. If new ones must be built, simple and small ones should also be promoted. According to the screening income situation in recent years, the profit income of the screening business is relatively large, and small cinemas and projection teams can fully recover their costs in two to three years. And the propaganda and education role for the broad masses of the people, and the lively cultural life of the people, will all have a huge role.

We develop the film production and screening business with such a policy. In terms of production, more than 120 art films and a large number of newsreels and scientific educational films can be produced in three or four years, which can catch up with or exceed France, Britain, and Italy (of course, surpass them in the ideological content of the works). The number of domestic screening audiences this year can exceed the number of domestic audiences in the United States (the number of domestic audiences in the United States was 2.4 billion the year before last, and the number decreased last year).

As for whether we can catch up with the level of advanced countries in the world in film science and technology in ten years, it is entirely possible as long as we break superstitions and create boldly.

Now I will list a few examples of the film machinery industry to illustrate this problem. Before liberation, all film equipment relied entirely on imports. However, after several years of efforts, not only has the backward state been basically reversed, but also individual products have caught up with or exceeded the advanced level in the world. At present, China's film equipment production includes large and small film cameras, projectors, recorders, developers, and complete sets of projection equipment, including widescreen, which can not only be self-sufficient but also has begun to export. In the technical equipment we manufacture ourselves, some projects refer to foreign materials or receive help from foreign experts. However, in the past two years, several major film machines designed and manufactured by ourselves have surpassed the level of similar types of products in the United States, Britain, France, and other countries in terms of performance. There have been even more rapid developments since last year, the main achievements of which are:

(1) The "Shanghai Brand" large-scale synchronous film camera produced by Shanghai Film Machinery Factory. The performance has surpassed the French "Debril" and British "Newall" type cameras, which are recognized as the best in the world. Its characteristics are low noise, easy loading, and easy operation of the tripod.

(2) The "Peace Brand" portable film camera produced by Nanjing Film Machinery Factory. It is lighter in weight and has a thinner handle, which is suitable for Asians. Its performance exceeds the French "Camebcx" and West German "Ariblex".

(3) The "Friendship Brand" automatic developer has a large amount of chemical tank circulation, high accuracy, convenient use and maintenance, and a large output per unit time. Its performance has exceeded the level of the "Duc" type, which is recognized as the best in the world.

(4) The 35mm synchronous magnetic recorder, its stability of operation has exceeded the British "GBK" and Swiss "Pcrbcter". In addition, the "Heilongjiang Brand" widescreen projector produced by Harbin Film Machinery Factory (the carbon arc power supply of the French "Natioral" brand is 75A, and the "Heilongjiang Brand" can reach 90-120A) and the "Nanjing Brand" Type II mobile 35mm projector produced by Nanjing Film Machinery Factory (the original design brightness of the Soviet Union was 250 lumens, and the brightness of the "Nanjing Brand" has reached 600 lumens after the Great Leap Forward) greatly exceeds the level of 400 lumens in the United Kingdom and 525 lumens in the United States. In terms of washing and printing color copies, our trial-produced color film dyeing and printing method has been successful. This so-called "Technicolor" has always been a special license for the United States, and they have strictly kept it secret for more than 20 years. A few years ago, the Soviet Union mastered the technology of natural color dyeing and printing through different research paths. Now, this dyeing and printing method has also been successfully tested in our country.

What should also be particularly mentioned is the innovative initiative created by the Chinese working people themselves, which has attracted the attention of various countries. This is the automatic device for projectors invented and created by Yang Bingti, a film projectionist in Chongqing, and Yao Liang, a film projectionist in Shanghai. After using this device, the entire film screening process is fully automated except for loading and unloading the film. This is our country's first creation, and neither socialist countries nor capitalist countries have such an automated device. This creation attracted the attention of various countries at the socialist countries' technical conference held in Prague this year, and requested to introduce and promote it. What is particularly noteworthy here is that Comrades Yang Bingti and Yao Liang, who have made contributions to the world film industry, are neither professors nor experts, they are just ordinary projection staff. This matter is of great inspiration for breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and resolutely taking the mass line.

Seriously study Chairman Mao's ideological style, and vigorously implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results to run the film industry. We believe that in about ten years, the Chinese film industry can be developed into an advanced country in the world. In about ten years, we can catch up with or exceed the United States in terms of business scale and number of films, and appear on the international film scene with high film technology and communist content and national style films.

    解放思想，在电影事业中坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设路线
　　文化部部长助理兼电影事业管理局局长  王阑西
    电影事业经过整风和反右派斗争，特别是在反浪费、反右倾保守运动和全国农业、工业大跃进以来，出现了新的情况。全国六万人的电影工作者的队伍，在党的领导下，正在以空前无比的干劲，在密切配合政治、为社会主义建设服务的方针下，在摄制影片、放映发行、机械生产等方面，都在鼓足干劲，实现大跃进，实现“奋斗三年改变面貌”的口号。今年摄制的各种影片将较去年增产一倍，甚至一倍以上。今年生产的大型影片（包括艺术片）将达一百部，成本降低30％以上；摄制时间缩短三分之一以上；放映场次大大增加，观众人次将达三十亿人次，（去年为二十亿人次）；机械工业生产总产值将增加60％，争取增加新的产品和改进原有的产品，以满足放映和制片设备的需要。广大电影工作者正在以破竹之势，打破过去层层束缚和种种限制，克服右倾保守思想，不断地出现新的纪录和创造。
    最近我们进行了“务虚”，并“以虚带实”，进一步全面地检查了电影工作。虽然电影事业的成绩是主要的，但缺点和错误是严重的，主要是：业务脱离政治，思想政治工作非常薄弱，业务与艺术创作中的资产阶级思想严重；教条主义、重外轻中、不从我国实际出发，生搬硬套外国的东西，缺少独创精神；电影事业的发展存在较严重的右倾保守思想，没有贯彻多、快、好、省的路线，发挥一切潜力，而是少、慢、差、费，在相当大的程度上阻碍了各方面的积极性，使电影事业落后于党和国家和广大人民的要求。几年来，由于党中央的直接领导，虽然没有犯重大错误，但是，由于上述的缺点和错误，电影事业走了不少弯路，没有充分的发挥电影对党的政策的宣传、社会主义改造工作和社会主义建设事业及人民的文化生活中所应有的作用。最近我们明确了“政治是统帅、是灵魂”，加强政治思想工作，以政治带动业务，坚决破除迷信，解放思想，坚决克服教条主义的错误，克服业务中的资产阶级思想，在电影事业中努力贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。必须政治是统帅，电影事业积极为政治服务、为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务的方针；必须破除迷信，解放思想，动员一切积极因素，发展电影事业；必须从六亿人民出发，面向中国广大观众（特别是广大的农民和工人），创造出共产主义思想内容和共产主义风格的真正为观众喜闻乐见的民族形式的新电影；必须在加强党的领导，在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的前提下，中央举办与地方举办相结合，大中小型相结合，文化部门举办与业务部门、群众组织自办相结合，这样发挥所有各方面对电影事业的积极性，充分发挥电影在社会主义建设事业中的巨大作用。
    动员一切积极因素，多快好省地办电影事业，就必须打破一切束缚，改变现有的体制，将权限下放，加强党对电影事业的领导，以地方为主办电影事业。改造旧中国遗留下的电影事业，在1953年已基本上完成了，可是积极地大力发展电影事业却进展得不太快。我们曾经错误的企图搞“大电影村”。这种错误虽然由于党迅速而及时的纠正了，但是我们并没有注意到电影事业也应该中央与地方结合，和大中小并举的方针。我们过分强调电影的特殊性和技术性，似乎必须由少数“内行”才能办好。同时，我们又过多地强调垂直领导，不尊重地方党和政府的领导，因而不论是制片、发行、放映都过多地集中到中央。在设备方面，我们也过分地要求大规模、现代化，造成国家投资的浪费。总之，就是过分地强调业务、艺术和技术，而忽视政治。这种错误的指导思想严重地束缚了电影事业的发展。当然，在改造旧中国遗留下的电影事业时是应该比较集中的，发展社会主义电影事业也是应该有计划的，电影也有它的特殊性，但是集中的时间不应该太长，集中的权限也不应该太多，亦不应该过分强调电影的特殊性。现在，我们坚决改变这种集中过多的方针和作法，实行下放地方、遍地开花。原来中央直属的制片厂、机械厂，除中央新闻纪录电影制片厂外都下交地方；电影制片提倡简化、小型，并要大、中、小同时并举；改变影片发行一律由中央集中管理，下交省（市）、自治区；改变放映单位由国家投资为地方投资和推行农村电影放映队由合作社自办。这样就可以动员一切积极因素加速电影事业的发展。
    电影是宣传党的方针政策、鼓舞广大群众的非常有力的武器。它可以用艺术形象宣传政策思想，宣传科学技术，更可以真实地反映我们伟大国家建设的面貌和英雄人民的崇高的精神面貌。几年来的事实都充分证明电影的作用。但是，电影能否正确地担负起这样的任务，能否正确地摄制好的、激动人心的影片，除了加强党对电影事业的领导，和政治应成为电影事业的统帅外，关键的问题是在于电影事业的队伍，特别是电影制片队伍中艺术工作者和技术工作者是否又红又专。我国的电影艺术工作者和技术工作者，八年来，经过多次政治运动的教育，特别是经过党中央和毛主席亲自领导的对电影“武训传”的批判，对胡风反动思想的批判，思想改造是有成绩的。但是这个思想改造的工作还远远没有最后完成。从前年党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策和去年党进行整风以来，电影工作者暴露出来的资产阶级思想是比较严重的。经过了反右派斗争，在思想上和政治上已经有了明确的认识，但是，在业务思想上还远远没有解决这个问题。由于电影艺术工作者和技术工作者大都是资产阶级知识分子，由于他们长期的忽视政治，脱离群众，他们的资产阶级世界观常常顽强地通过艺术形象表现出来。因此，要求他们摄制真正有高度思想性和艺术性，以共产主义思想教育人民的影片，要求他们迅速创作反映今天广大劳动人民的伟大斗争、崇高的思想品质、豪迈奔放的情感和无数新人新事的影片是不可能的。一支新型的无产阶级的电影队伍的建成，还要依靠于练兵和建军，还要他们（原有的和新的）和工农兵群众相结合，从群众的生活和斗争中吸收滋养。只有他们在波澜壮阔的群众的生活和斗争中锻炼，才能产生好的影片。所以，为了更好地改造这个队伍，我们一面抽出人员下放深入生活，同时组织艺术、技术人员采取较迅速的工作方法拍摄反映当前伟大生活的影片，也通过影片的拍摄，深入工厂、农村和连队，与工农兵群众接触，了解群众的生活，加速自己的改造。争取较迅速地建成一支无产阶级的电影队伍。同时，在影片生产中，电影艺术创作继续坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，丰富电影的题材、样式，更大胆的创造电影艺术的民族形式，努力贯彻毛主席所提倡的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，表现我们时代和人民，表现工人阶级的、共产主义的风格。
    贯彻多快好省的办电影事业。我们认为：将制片事业下放，各省（市）、自治区举办电影制片厂。除少数省市由中央直属的制片厂下放归地方管理外，大多数没有制片厂的省（市）、自治区，要迅速实现“省（市、自治区）有制片厂”。从今年起，在勤俭办企业的原则下，先建立小型的、简易的制片厂，开始摄制一些以反映本省社会主义建设情况为主的新闻纪录片和科学教育片，并自明年起迅速地分批地安装制片技术设备，自明年开始再进一步将有条件的省（市）、自治区的制片厂逐渐拍摄艺术片，争取在第二个五年计划期间或更多的一些时间内除个别地区外，一般都能摄制新闻纪录片、科学教育片和艺术片。这些影片是为建设事业服务的，这些影片真正可能是富有地方色彩的和民族特点的影片，是“百花齐放”“万紫千红”。另一方面在这几年中适当扩建原有的制片厂和利用已有条件建立的专业性制片厂，以促成电影制片事业的高涨。这样在十年左右，电影事业的规模就可以适应强大的祖国的需要。每年影片的产量将大大增加，将不是艺术片几十部、新闻纪录等影片二三百部，而将是几百部艺术片和更多的其他影片了。这样发展电影事业主要的问题有三个：干部、设备和胶片供应。干部问题可以大批培养、训练。设备依靠已有电影机械工业厂生产供应。至于胶片问题，化学工业部已经在积极准备和安排。资金问题能不能解决呢？这样分散去办是较易解决的。这样全面发展、遍地开花的发展电影制片事业决不是没有困难的，但是，我们相信，这些困难是可以克服的。
    我们认为：与制片事业发展同时也大力发展放映事业，以适应广大人民的要求，虽然我们放映单位已有一万个稍多（解放前只有七百个），去年的观众已有二十亿人次，但，80％的县城还没有电影院，广大农村只有极少数的放映队，平均农村人口一年还看不到两次电影，电影放映还远远不能起到应有的作用，所以，必须大力发展，发展的方针应该是在十年或更多一些时间内达到县有电影院，乡有放映队。争取在五年内达到90％县城有电影院，三个乡有一个放映队。如果达到这个要求，则中小县城的居民每年看电影可以达到十次，农民每年看到电影六至八次。电影院由地方举办，放映队则以农业社联合举办或自办为主，这样就可以节约国家的资金，逐渐达到电影普及。电影院的规格可以降低。除大中城市新建外，一般县城均可以现有的礼堂或旧房子改用，必须新建的亦推行简易的、小型的。根据几年来放映收入的情况看，放映事业的利润收入是较大的，小型电影院和放映队，有二年至三年即可全部收回成本。而对广大人民的宣传教育作用，和活跃人民的文化生活，都将有巨大的作用。
    我们以这样的方针发展电影制片、放映事业，在制片方面三年或四年，即可生产艺术片一百二十部以上，和大量的新闻纪录片、科学教育片，可以赶上或超过法国、英国、意大利（在作品的思想内容上当然超过他们）；我们的国内放映观众人次今年就可超过美国国内观众人次（美国国内观众人次前年为二十四亿人次，去年的数字又下降）。
    至于我们在电影科学技术方面在十年内能否赶上世界的先进国家的水平呢？只要破除迷信、大胆创造，是完全可能的。
    现在我就电影机械工业列举几个例子来说明这个问题。解放前一切电影器材完全依靠进口，可是，经过几年的努力，不仅落后的状态已经基本扭转，而且在个别产品上已经赶上或超过了世界上的先进水平。目前我国电影器材生产包括大小型电影摄影机、放映机、录音机、显影机以及包括宽银幕在内的成套放映设备，不仅可以自给而且已经开始出口。在我们自己制造的技术设备中，若干项目参考了国外资料，或者得到国外专家的帮助。但是，这两年来，我们自己设计制造的几种主要电影机械，在性能上已经超过了美、英、法等国的相似类型产品的水平，去年以来更有了飞跃的发展，其中主要的成就有：
    （1）上海电影机械厂出品的“上海牌”大型同步电影摄影机。性能已经超过了世界上公认为最优良的法国“Debril”和英国的“Newall”型摄影机，它的特点是杂音少，装片方便，脚架便于操作。
    （2）南京电影机械厂出品的“和平牌”手提式电影摄影机，重量较轻，手柄较细，适合于东方人使用，性能超过法国的“Camebcx”和西德的“Ariblex”。
    （3）“友谊牌”自动显影机，药箱循环量大，准确性高，使用检修方便，单位时间的产量大，它的性能已超过世界公认为最好的“Duc”型的水平。
    （4）35毫米同步磁性录音机，它的运转稳定程度已经超过英国的“GBK”和瑞士的“Pcrbcter”。此外，还有哈尔滨电影机械厂出品的“黑龙江牌”宽银幕放映机（法国“Natioral”牌的炭精电源器高为75A，“黑龙江牌”可达90—120A）和南京电影机械厂出品的“南京牌”二型移动式35毫米放映机（苏联原设计的光亮度为250流明，大跃进后“南京牌”的光亮度已达到600流明）大大超过英国的400流明和美国的525流明的水平。就洗印彩色拷贝方面说，我们试制的彩色片染印法已经成功。这种所谓“天然色”（T Icbni Colour），一直是美国专卖特许的，他们严格保密了二十多年。几年前苏联经过不同的研究途径，掌握了天然色染印法的技术，现在，这种染印法在我国也已经试验成功了。
    还应该特别提出来的，是中国劳动人民自己创造，而已经引起各国重视的革新创举。这就是重庆市电影放映员杨秉悌和上海市电影放映员姚亮发明创造的放映机自动化装置。使用这种装置之后，放映员除装卸影片以外，整部电影放映过程就全部自动化。这是我国的首创，无论是社会主义国家或资本主义国家都还没有这种自动化的装置。这个创造在今年布拉格举行的社会主义国家技术会议上引起了各国的重视，要求介绍推广。这里特别值得注意的是对世界电影事业作出贡献的杨秉悌、姚亮同志，既不是教授，又不是专家，他们只不过是普通的放映人员。这一件事，对于破除迷信、解放思想、坚决走群众路线这个问题有很大的启发。
    认真学习毛主席的思想作风，大力贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线来办电影事业，我们认为：在十年左右的时间内，可以把中国电影事业发展成为世界上的先进国家。十年左右我们可以在事业规模、影片数量上赶上或超过美国，并以高度的电影技术和共产主义内容的、民族风格的电影出现于国际影坛。
