    "This is really a first!"
    The old granny quietly called to Sister Liu,
    Giving her a knowing look,
    That big girl feeding pigs,
    Heard she was a teaching assistant at a university,
    Yesterday she was sent down to our commune,
    This morning, she's already holding a pig-feeding ladle.
    Don't let her delicate skin and slender figure fool you,
    She's really good at her work.
    She feeds the sows in separate troughs,
    Boils the food and carries water,
    The pig troughs are overflowing with leftovers,
    She scoops it all into the slop bucket with her hands.
    She scrubs the pig troughs sparkling clean,
    And even scratches the pigs' itches.
    She doesn't mind the dirt or the hard work,
    Treating the pigs like precious treasures.
    I'm seventy-three this year,
    And I've seen my fair share of things,
    A cadre not being a cadre but a pig feeder,
    Heh heh!
    This is really a first!

    “这还真是头一遭”
    老奶奶悄悄叫刘嫂，
    使个眼色你瞧瞧，
    喂猪那个大姑娘，
    听说在大学当助教，
    昨天下放到咱社，
    今早就端猪食瓢。
    别看她细皮嫩肉挺苗条，
    干起活来可不孬。
    母猪克郎分槽喂，
    烧火温食把水挑，
    猪吃剩食满槽邦，
    用手搂进泔水筲。
    猪槽刷个溜干净，
    还替猪把痒痒挠。
    不嫌脏还不怕累。
    拿猪就当希罕宝。
    今年我活了七十三，
    经的事情不算少，
    干部不当当猪倌，
    嘿嘿！
    这还真是头一遭。
