Xinhua News Agency, June 1st – The "Red Flag" bi-monthly magazine, sponsored by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was published today, and readers across the country are vying to subscribe. As of today, the number of subscriptions requested from the Beijing Post Office by some provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country has reached 1.98 million copies.

In the capital, Beijing, today, at more than 140 retail locations selling "Red Flag" bi-monthly magazines throughout the city, people lined up to buy the inaugural issue. Nearly 196,000 copies were sold in less than a day. Due to the crowds of buyers, supply could not keep up with demand, and sales were temporarily suspended at 3:00 PM.

The enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens for subscribing to and reserving individual copies of "Red Flag" is also unprecedented. According to preliminary statistics, the number of subscriptions in the city has exceeded 200,000 copies. Many institutions, factories, and neighborhoods are subscribing for dozens or even more than a hundred copies. Clerks at post and telecommunications bureaus and newspaper and magazine outlets are overwhelmed. Many post and telecommunications bureaus have seen long lines of people waiting to subscribe. The director of the Tilanqiao Post and Telecommunications Bureau in the factory district also went to the counter to help with subscription work. Shanghai publishing and distribution units are preparing to print 260,000 copies of "Red Flag" magazine after the paper plates are airlifted from Beijing to Shanghai, and strive to print and supply all of them before the 5th.

The Tianjin Post Office today delivered the first batch of 9,400 copies of the inaugural issue of "Red Flag" bi-monthly magazine to subscribers. The faculty and staff of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's Intermediate Party School each received a copy. They said, "We must plant the red flag of the proletarian revolution in our minds." Many workers at the Tianjin Tractor Factory and the Tianjin Bicycle Factory also subscribed to "Red Flag." The workers said, "Chairman Mao's articles are very profound, but we workers can understand them. Reading Chairman Mao's articles fills us with confidence. Theory is not mysterious, and we workers can certainly master it!"

In Xi'an, according to incomplete statistics, the number of pre-orders has reached 100,000 copies. Early in the morning of the 31st, before business hours, people lined up in a long queue in front of the newspaper and magazine outlet of the Dongda Street Post Office. They repeatedly asked the clerks to deliver the inaugural issue to readers as soon as possible. All fifty-eight cadres of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League who remained in the office subscribed to a copy. Nearly 100 percent of the staff of units such as the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Xi'an Teachers' Continuing Education School also subscribed. Zhang Zhenke, a worker at the Xi'an Grain Station, jumped up with joy before he had even finished listening to the broadcast, and ran to the dispatch room to ask the newspaper and magazine promoter to subscribe.

Shortly after the Jiangsu Provincial Post Office issued a notice to all cities and counties at 5:00 PM on May 30 to accept subscriptions to "Red Flag," it received a large number of replies for pre-orders, and the number of orders from various places was repeatedly increased. At dawn on the 31st, people were already waiting at the entrance of the Nanjing Post Office. By the 31st, the number of pre-orders for "Red Flag" in Jiangsu Province had exceeded 180,000 copies.

　　争先恐后读“红旗”
    全国部分省、区、市已预订近二百万份
    新华社1日讯　中共中央主办的“红旗”半月刊今天出版，各地读者争相预订购阅。截至今日止全国部分省、市、自治区向北京邮局要求预订的，已达一百九十八万份。
    首都北京今天一天中，全市一百四十多个零销“红旗”半月刊的地点，群众排队购买创刊号，不到一天即售出十九万六千份，因购买者拥挤，供应不及，到下午三时即暂时停止销售。
    上海市民踊跃订阅和预约零购“红旗”的情况也空前热烈。据初步统计，全市预订数已在二十万份以上。很多机关、工厂、里弄都是一订几十份甚至一百多份。各邮电局和报刊门市部的营业员都应接不暇，很多邮电局门前出现了排队预订的盛况。工厂区的提篮桥邮电局局长也上了柜台帮助做收订工作。上海市出版、发行有关单位准备在“红旗”杂志的纸型由北京空运上海后印二十六万册，争取在5日前全部印就供应。
    天津市邮局，今天已把收到的第一批九千四百份“红旗”半月刊创刊号送到订户手里。中共天津市委所属中级党校的教职员人手一册，他们说：“一定要把无产阶级革命的红旗，插在自己的思想上。”天津拖拉机制造厂、天津自行车厂，许多工人也订了“红旗”，工人们说：“毛主席的文章，道理很深，可是我们工人能够看懂。看了主席的文章，充满了信心，理论是没有什么神秘的，我们工人一定能掌握它！”
    西安市据不完全统计，预订数已达十万份。31日清早，还没有到营业时间，人们就在东大街邮局报刊门市部门前，排起了长长的行列。他们再三要求营业员早些把创刊号送到读者手里。共青团西安市委留在机关的五十八名干部，每人都订了一份。陕西省农林厅和西安市教师进修学校等单位，订阅的人也几乎达到百分之百。西安市粮食站工人张震苛还没有听完广播，就高兴得跳了起来，一口气跑到收发室找报刊推行员要求订阅。
    江苏省邮局5月30日下午五时向各市、县发出接受订购“红旗”的通知后不久，就接到大批预订的回电，各地一再加码。31日天刚亮，南京市邮局门口就有人等候了。到31日止，江苏省预订“红旗”的数字即突破十八万份。（附图片）
