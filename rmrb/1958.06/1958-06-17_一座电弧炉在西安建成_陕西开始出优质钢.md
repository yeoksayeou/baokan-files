    An Electric Arc Furnace Completed in Xi'an
    Shaanxi Begins Producing High-Quality Steel
    (Our report) According to the Shaanxi Daily news: The first electric arc furnace in Xi'an, built by the Northwest Automobile and Machine Tool Repair Factory, successively produced two heats of high-quality steel on June 11th and 12th. According to pre-furnace testing, the steel's impurity content, tensile strength, elongation, and other properties all met the national standards. If the potential of this electric arc furnace is further developed and some equipment is added, it can meet the needs of machine factories in the Xi'an area for various high-quality steel castings.
    In the past, the high-quality steel castings needed by this factory to manufacture machinery were either ordered from the Shanghai Steel Plant or forged from steel materials themselves. This was both labor-intensive and material-wasting, and often could not meet the needs. In order to solve this problem, the factory sent people to Shanghai to learn steelmaking technology, and then began building the furnace in April of this year. Under normal circumstances, it would take six months to a year to build such a furnace, and the equipment costs would be more than 300,000 yuan. Thanks to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, who actively sought solutions and overcame various difficulties, the electric arc furnace was completed in only two months and ten days, at a cost of more than 100,000 yuan.
    From the very first heat of steel, this factory has adopted the latest technologies and methods, such as using high-voltage electric arcs to melt steel, and using rapid boiling methods. At the same time, due to good slag making and accurate control of the reduction operation method and time, the quality of the No. 35 steel produced was good, meeting the national requirements of phosphorus and sulfur content below 0.04%, tensile strength not less than 50 kg per square millimeter, and elongation not less than 19%.

    一座电弧炉在西安建成
    陕西开始出优质钢
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：西北汽车机具修配厂建成的西安第一座电弧炼钢炉，在6月11、12日接连炼出两炉优质钢。根据炉前检验，钢的含杂、抗拉能力、伸长率等都达到国家规定的标准。这座电弧炼钢炉的潜力如果进一步得到发挥并添设部分设备，就可满足西安地区机器厂对各种优质钢铸件的需要。
    这个工厂过去制造机械所需的优质钢铸件，不是到上海炼钢厂订货，就是自己用钢材锻造成型。这样，既费工、又费料，还经常赶不上需要。为了解决这个问题，这个工厂曾经派人到上海学习炼钢技术，随后在今年4月份开始建炉。按一般情况，建成这样一座炉子，需要半年到一年时间，设备费用需三十多万元。由于职工们发挥了革命干劲，积极想办法，战胜了种种困难。前后只用了两个月零十天的时间，花了十多万元，电弧炉就全部建成了。
    这个工厂从炼第一炉钢开始，就采用最新的技术和方法，如利用高电压的电弧来熔化钢铁，并采用了快速沸腾的方法等。同时，由于造渣造的好，准确地掌握还原的操作法和时间，炼出的三十五号钢质量良好，达到了国家含磷、硫在0.04％以下的要求，和每平方公厘的抗拉力不低于五十公斤、伸长率不低于19％的标准。
