Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, 35 million Young Pioneers and children across the country have responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League by extensively launching three activities—planting, eliminating the four pests, and speaking Putonghua—and various activities to help construction. The life of the Young Pioneers appears vibrant and rich through these activities.

"We will also support the Forty Articles," and "Help the motherland realize the Second Five-Year Plan," are the slogans of the Young Pioneers in carrying out various activities. The Young Pioneers in Beijing gloriously participated in the greening of the People's Heroes Monument site, and the Young Pioneers in each district built a Young Pioneers' Forest. The Young Pioneers in twenty-six counties and cities in Jilin Province built a total of 1,233 Young Pioneers' Forests and 1,342 Young Pioneers' nurseries, and planted tens of millions of oil crops such as sunflowers and castor beans. In the activities of greening the banks of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Songhua River, the Wujiang River, the Fen River, and the Northwest Plateau, the Young Pioneers, together with the members of the Communist Youth League, not only planted saplings on barren land, but also carried out forest protection activities to ensure the growth of the saplings. The Young Pioneers are active participants in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. While catching mice, killing sparrows, and digging pupae, they also organize activities such as "Young Hygiene Supervision Posts" and "Red Scarf Hygiene Streets." The children not only develop clean and hygienic habits in these activities, but also promote them everywhere.

Young Pioneers in various places have already established many small factories, small farms, Young Pioneers' agricultural cooperatives, etc., from which they have learned a lot of labor knowledge and skills. The Young Pioneers in Jiuba Township, Meitan County, Guizhou, participated in planting experimental fields, and learned the techniques of plowing, transplanting rice seedlings, weeding, threshing, and digging soil. The yield per mu of rice planted by them using advanced techniques was even higher than the local average yield. The adults praised them and said that these children will definitely be much stronger than the older generation when they grow up. Many rural children participated in the vigorously developing agricultural tool reform movement in various places, and demonstrated their wisdom. Ma Jiahe, a fourteen-year-old boy from Wuchang County, Hubei, created a "dog-head cart" that increased the efficiency of transporting earth by more than three times. After this earth-moving tool was promoted, it helped the county complete the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon Reservoir project ahead of schedule. Su Hongzhang, a boy from Enping County, Guangdong, made a lightweight handcart, which promoted the motorization movement in his agricultural cooperative.

Contributing to the socialist construction of the motherland is the general wish of the children. Since the winter of 1955, under the guidance of the Young Pioneers organization, children across the country have been extensively launching the "Small Five-Year Plan" activities, doing their best to help industrial and agricultural construction. In the "One Basket of Manure" campaign launched by children in Heilongjiang Province last winter, a total of 1.6 billion jin of manure was collected and sent to local agricultural cooperatives. This spring, they provided agricultural cooperatives with enough manure for 60,000 hectares of land. At present, "Red Scarf Reservoirs," "Red Scarf Hydropower Stations," and "Red Scarf Tractor Stations" have appeared in many provinces and cities. These reservoirs, hydropower stations, and tractor stations are all established by the Young Pioneers with the income from carrying out activities such as picking up grain, planting oil crops, and collecting scrap metal. Recently, the Young Pioneers in eighteen counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province, such as Wangkui and Fangzheng, are also preparing to use part of the income from participating in public welfare labor to buy forty-three tractors to support local agricultural mechanization.

　　爱文化爱劳动为大跃进出一分力
    少年儿童生气勃勃
    新华社31日讯　在社会主义建设大跃进的浪潮中，全国各地三千五百万少先队员和广大少年儿童响应共青团中央的号召，广泛地展开了种植、除四害、讲普通话三项活动和各种帮助建设活动。少先队的生活通过这些活动显得生气勃勃，丰富多彩。
    “我们也来支援四十条”，“帮助祖国实现第二个五年计划”，这是少先队员们开展各种活动的口号。北京市的少先队员们光荣地参加了人民英雄纪念碑场地的绿化工作，每个区的少先队员都营造了一个少年林。吉林省二十六个县、市的少先队员，共营造了一千二百三十三个少年林，建立了一千三百四十二个少年苗圃，并且种植了数以千万计的向日葵和蓖麻等油料作物。在绿化长江、黄河、松花江、乌江、汾河两岸和西北高原的活动中，少先队员们跟共青团员一起，不但在荒地上种上了树苗，而且展开护林活动，保证树苗的成长。少先队员们是除四害讲卫生运动的积极参加者，他们在捕鼠、打麻雀、挖蛹的同时，还组织“少年卫生监督岗”、“红领巾卫生街”等活动，孩子们不但自己在这些活动中养成清洁卫生的习惯，而且到处向人宣传。
    各地少先队员已经建立起不少小工厂、小农场、少年农业社等，从中学到不少劳动知识和本领。贵州湄潭县九坝乡的少先队员参加种试验田，学会了犁田、插秧、薅秧、打谷和挖土等技术，他们学习先进技术栽种的水稻，每亩产量甚至比当地的平均产量都高。大人们赞扬他们说，这些孩子长大了一定比老一辈强得多。不少农村的少年儿童参加了各地蓬勃发展的农具改革运动，并且表现了自己的智慧。湖北武昌县十四岁的少年马家和，创造了一种“狗头车”，提高运土效率三倍多，这种运土工具推广以后，帮助了这个县兴修的三潭印月水库工程提前完成。广东恩平县少年儿童苏洪章制作了一部轻便的手推车，推动了他所在的农业社开展车子化运动。
    为祖国社会主义建设出一分力，这是少年儿童们的普遍愿望。从1955年冬天以来，全国各地少年儿童在少先队组织的引导下，就一直在广泛地展开“小五年计划”活动，尽自己的力所能及来帮助工农业建设。黑龙江省少年儿童在去年冬天展开的“一筐粪”运动中，共拣了十六亿斤粪肥送给当地的农业社。今年春天他们又给农业社送了可供六万公顷地用的粪肥。目前，在许多省、市都出现了“红领巾水库”、“红领巾水电站”、“红领巾拖拉机站”，这些水库、水电站和拖拉机站都是由少先队员们用开展拣粮、种植油料作物、收集废金属等活动的收入建立起来的。最近黑龙江省的望奎、方正等十八个县、市的少先队员，还准备用参加公益劳动的一部分收入买四十三台拖拉机，来支援当地的农业机械化。
