Our Newspaper reports: Reporter Zheng Shiwen reports: Zhou Hanhua, a member of the Communist Youth League in Xinhui County, has created a successful experience in "distant hybridization" by using rice and sorghum hybridization. This has shaken the national agricultural science community, which believes that this initiative has opened up a new model for cultivating improved varieties. A national seed visiting group composed of more than 120 responsible cadres, professors, and experts from agricultural departments, who are currently visiting Guangdong, made a special visit on the 7th to this 23-year-old young farmer breeder who only attended elementary school for four and a half years.

On the afternoon of the 7th, representatives from all over the country lined up excitedly in the hot sun and visited in batches the five rice-sorghum hybrid varieties (Xingfu Nian, Xinong Nian, Mashan Lida, Xinnian, Aibai Nian) planted on two fen of land. The five rice varieties before hybridization were also excellent rice seeds cultivated by Zhou Hanhua in 1956 from natural hybrid strange ears of grain. The representatives observed each variety that was being filled. The best performing was Xingfu Nian, with stems as thick as a little finger, sword leaves that were long, hard, and wide, more than twice as wide as ordinary rice seedlings, and root systems that were particularly deep and developed. The ears of grain were more than nine inches long, with twelve to sixteen ear branches per ear, with large ears having more than four hundred grains, and an average of three hundred grains per ear. Before hybridization, this variety only had six-inch-long ears with only one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty grains per ear. The other four varieties also showed large ears and thick stems, exhibiting sorghum characteristics to varying degrees. Zhou Hanhua introduced that when the first generation was heading and flowering last year, it was attacked by a level 10 typhoon, but the grains were still full; this year, it also encountered a level 6 to 7 typhoon, and other rice seedlings fell, but it remained standing still. Each variety still shows some segregation this year, but still maintains the common characteristics: thick and strong stalks, very few empty grains, and very strong resistance to wind and disease. Even more strangely, regardless of the height of the seedlings, they all show large ears with many heavy grains, averaging three hundred grains, and the least having more than two hundred grains. Experts said that according to the number of grains per ear, each mu of land can yield 2,000 jin per crop.

Zhou Hanhua grew up in a poor peasant family and loved labor since he was a child. In 1955, after joining the cooperative, he participated in a technical class held by the county, and since then he became more interested in studying agricultural production technology. In 1956, he used the experimental field cultivated with grain-selected Jinshan Nian, and the yield per mu reached 1,625 jin. However, this was still not up to his ideal. He hoped to have a new rice variety that had large ears with many grains like sorghum, strong stalks, did not fall over, and was not afraid of pests and diseases. Could rice be hybridized with sorghum? He began to think boldly. Encouraged by the secretary of the township party branch, he painstakingly studied and observed the flowering period of sorghum and rice, and conducted bit-by-bit research. Hybridization requires a set of tools, but he only had a thermometer and a large pair of scissors. Accurate timing is required for warm soup emasculation during hybridization. What to do without a clock? He repeatedly counted five hundred times in advance against the agricultural cooperative's wall clock, which was exactly the required eight minutes. Without a kettle, he used a sealed teapot instead. In this way, he overcame the difficulties one by one.

Zhou Hanhua's successful experience has broken the long-term superstitions of the scientific community. The authoritative conclusion that varieties of distant hybridization are not easy to continue to maintain their original excellent traits and have many blank grains has been overturned by facts.

    青年农民周汉华的创举震动农业科学界
    水稻与高粱杂交良种培育成功
    本报讯　记者郑世文报道：新会县共青团员周汉华，采用水稻与高粱杂交创造出“远缘杂交”的成功经验，震动全国农业科学界，纷纷认为这一创举开辟了培育良种的新范例。正在广东参观的由一百二十多名农业部门的负责干部、教授、专家组成的全国种子参观团，7日特地拜访了这位仅念过四年半小学的二十三岁的青年农民育种家。
    7日下午，来自祖国各地的代表，在炎热的阳光下兴高彩烈的排着队，分批参观种在两分地的五个水稻—高粱杂交良种（幸福粘、新农粘、马山理达、新粘、矮白粘）。杂交前的五个水稻品种，也是由周汉华于1956年选出的自然杂交奇怪谷穗培育成的优良水稻种。代表们逐棵地观察了正在灌浆的各个品种。表现最好的是幸福粘，茎秆粗大得像小指那么大，剑叶又长又硬又阔，比普通禾苗宽一倍多，根群扎得特别深和发达，谷穗达九寸多长，一穗分十二至十六个穗枝，大穗达四百多粒谷，平均每穗也有三百粒。这个种在杂交前穗长只六寸，每穗仅一百二十至一百三十粒。其他四个品种也同样表现穗长大，茎秆粗大，不同程度的表现出高粱的性状。周汉华介绍说，去年第一代正在抽穗扬花时遭十级台风的袭击，结实仍然饱满；今年也遇上六至七级台风，旁的禾苗倒伏了，它依然站立不动。各个品种今年还略有分离现象，但仍保持着共同的特点：秆粗壮，穗很少空粒，抗风抗病力非常强。更奇怪的是，不论禾苗高矮，都表现出穗大粒多实重，平均有三百粒，最少的也有二百粒以上。专家们说，按照每穗的粒数计算，一亩田每造可达二千斤产量。
    周汉华生长在贫农家庭里，从小就热爱劳动。1955年入社后参加了县举办的技术班学习，从此对农业生产技术的钻研更感兴趣。1956年，他用经过粒选金山粘搞的试验田，每亩产量达一千六百二十五斤。可是，这还不合他的理想，他希望有一种像高粱一样的穗大粒多、秆壮、不倒伏、不怕病虫害的水稻新品种。水稻能否与高粱杂交？他开始大胆地想。在乡党支部书记的鼓励下，他苦心钻研，观察高粱、水稻的开花期，进行点滴研究。搞杂交需要有一套工具，但他只有一个温度计和一把大剪刀。杂交时温汤杀雄需要掌握准确的时间，没有时钟怎办呢？他就预先对着农业社的挂钟反复口数五百次，刚好是所需的八分钟。没有热水壶就用茶煲密闭代替。就这样，困难被他一个一个地克服了。
    周汉华的成功经验，破除了科学界的长期迷信。过去认定远缘杂交的品种，不易继续保持它原来获得的优良性状和谷粒空白多等权威结论，已被事实推翻。
