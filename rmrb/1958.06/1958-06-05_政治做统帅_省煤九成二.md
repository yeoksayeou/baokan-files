At the teaching demonstration of the horseshoe-shaped backdraft stove, being promoted throughout the People's Liberation Army, more than 150 engineers, quartermaster cadres, and cooks from various army, navy, and air force units surrounded a young soldier squatting by a stove. They carefully observed the structure of the horseshoe-shaped backdraft stove, following his instructions, while listening to his explanation: "When using this type of stove, the flames first go from under the pot to the back, then around the bottom of the pot to the front, and the smoke travels back to the front of the stove before exiting through the chimney. This allows the flames to heat the entire pot, fully utilizing the energy of the coal..."

This young soldier is Chen Ende, a private first class in the cooking squad of the Sixth Company of a certain PLA unit. The horseshoe-shaped backdraft stove he modified miraculously reduced the company's cooking coal consumption from an average of 28 ounces per person per day to 2.3 ounces. If this reduction could be universally achieved across the army, it would save the country hundreds of thousands of tons of coal annually. Therefore, representatives from all military branches and military regions came to learn from his experience.

Last winter, the Sixth Company's cooking coal consumption averaged 28 ounces per person per day, far exceeding the supply standard. The overage was deducted from the mess fund, resulting in poor meals. Soldiers complained a lot, with some mocking the cooking squad as the "sick ward." To change this situation, the company transferred Communist Youth League members like Chen Ende to the cooking squad as backbone personnel. Chen Ende and others worked very hard in the cooking squad, but because they continued to use the old backdraft stove and cooking methods, coal consumption remained around 28 ounces, frustrating Chen Ende. At this time, the cooking squad of the Sergeant Training Company invented a horseshoe-shaped stove that burned only eight ounces of coal per person per day. At the on-site meeting to promote this stove throughout the regiment, Chen Ende questioned himself: "We're all cooks, how come they can figure out how to modify a stove, and we can't?"

As soon as he returned to the squad, Chen Ende and group leader Li Zhicai put a lot of effort into modifying the original backdraft stove into a horseshoe-shaped backdraft stove. However, when they tried to light it, the coal wouldn't burn well, and the smoke was trapped in the firebox, delaying the company's mealtime. The cooking squad leader said angrily, "Stop messing around! I've been a cooking squad leader for so many years, and I've never seen this kind of stove."

Frustrated by this, Chen Ende felt a little discouraged. But he remembered what the regiment leader said at the on-site meeting: "There will always be some difficulties at the beginning of anything, as long as you don't lose heart, you can succeed." So, he plucked up his courage and continued to modify the stove with Li Zhicai. They modified it again and again, but still couldn't get it right. The cooking squad leader got angry and shouted at Chen Ende, "It's no use modifying it, tear it down! If you don't tear it down, you'll be responsible for delaying the meal!" With that, he rolled up his sleeves and was about to tear down the stove. Chen Ende's face turned red with anxiety. He said to the squad leader, "Modifying the stove is a task assigned by the leaders, you'll be responsible if you tear it down. If we were fighting at the front, would we stop if we didn't complete the task?" These words stopped the squad leader.

Only Li Zhicai continued to study with Chen Ende, helping him to light the fire. So as not to affect the company's meals, they modified it overnight after dinner. For three or four days in a row, they worked until after midnight every day, and got up again at 2:30 the next morning to make breakfast. Exhausted, Chen Ende and Li Zhicai still encouraged each other to persevere.

At this time, the company commander and political instructor came to the cooking squad. The company leaders encouraged them to continue modifying the stove, to study the reasons for the failure, and appointed the quartermaster to assist them. The company commander also severely criticized the cooking squad leader for not pouring cold water on them. With the support of the leadership, Chen Ende's enthusiasm increased even more, and he jumped into the firebox again to modify it. That afternoon, Chen Ende accidentally discovered that when the pot was lifted, the flames burned very strongly, and his mind suddenly lit up. It turned out that the horseshoe was built too high, the pot was pressing on the flue, and there was too little air in the firebox, so the coal couldn't burn. They immediately modified the horseshoe to make the flue unobstructed, and the flames immediately burned strongly, reducing coal consumption from 28 ounces to 12 ounces. The idea of catching up with the advanced motivated Chen Ende and Li Zhicai not to be satisfied with their existing achievements. After further research, they found that the stove was a bit too big, the flames were not concentrated, and the distance between the bottom of the pot and the grate was too far, so the small flames could not directly burn the bottom of the pot. They modified the stove again, and coal consumption was reduced to nine ounces.

This initial success convinced all the comrades in the squad. The cooking squad leader and Master Wang reviewed their mistakes at the squad meeting. With everyone's thinking unified, the squad meeting immediately became a brainstorming session, with everyone offering suggestions, such as making the firebox smaller. Chen Ende also came up with some ways to save both kindling and coal. As a result, coal consumption dropped to an average of only 6.7 ounces per person per day, and the Sixth Company cooking squad jumped from being the most backward unit in the regiment to the most advanced.

At the regiment's commendation meeting, Chen Ende and the Sixth Company cooking squad were commended, and their advanced experience was promoted. The regiment leaders called on them to continue to find tricks to save more coal for the country. Just then, complacency blocked their path forward like a mountain. "We've exhausted all the methods, we can't save any more," Chen Ende thought, but he still said to everyone, "The regiment leaders are calling on us to burn less, do you see any other ways?" At this question, the whole squad clamored, this one saying: "It's impossible, we've run out of ideas!" That one said: "If we want to reduce it further, then let's not burn coal!" No one seriously used their brains to study it.

The regiment leaders found that the Sixth Company cooking squad was stagnating. Director Xue of the Political Department specially came to the cooking squad and explained to them the benefits of saving coal, and how that saving can improve the whole company's food situation. He repeatedly explained that coal is the "grain of industry," and saving coal can support the country's industrial construction. These words hit Chen Ende and all the comrades in the squad like artillery shells. Seeing everyone getting excited, Director Xue directly exposed the root of everyone's ideological problems. He said: "Don't be complacent! You are advanced units now, but if you stop, others will walk ahead of you."

Next, the whole squad held several brainstorming sessions in a row, further focusing on saving coal from the cooking methods. Everyone came up with eight or nine methods. For example, when using coal to keep the fire going, mix one-third coal slag with two-thirds yellow earth; immediately pour cold water into the pot after putting the fire down, using the heat of the pot to warm the water, and use the warm water to cook rice and vegetables for the next meal; break the large pieces of coal, soak them in water, and the next day they will burn very strongly and the coal will be completely burned through; in order not to waste coal, watch the flames frequently, add coal frequently, and close the stove door frequently... After applying these methods comprehensively, coal consumption dropped in a straight line to an average of only 2.3 ounces per person per day, saving nearly 92% compared to before the stove was modified.

Chen Ende only attended school for two years, and then spent three years as a cowherd. The fact that he modified the stove and saved coal vividly illustrates the great truth that technology is not mysterious and everyone can innovate. Currently, he and his cooking squad have become the banner of saving cooking coal in the army. The unit leaders specifically issued a commendation order, deciding to give Chen Ende a promotion in rank and grade – from private to deputy squad leader, from private first class to corporal – as a reward. His companion Li Zhicai was awarded first-class merit, and the Sixth Company cooking squad was awarded collective second-class merit.

　　政治做统帅　省煤九成二
    新华社记者　于逢源
    在中国人民解放军全军推广马蹄形回风灶的教学现场上，来自陆海空军各部队的一百五十多名工程师、军需干部和炊事兵，都围着一个蹲在炉灶上的青年战士。他们一面随着他的指点仔细地观察着马蹄形回风灶的构造，一面听他介绍说：“使用这种炉灶，火苗先由锅底向后，再绕过锅底向前转，煤烟回游到炉灶的前边，从烟囱冒出去，这样，火苗就能烧遍全锅，煤的能量就被充分利用了……。”
    这位青年战士，是解放军某部六连炊事班上等兵陈恩德。他改造的马蹄形回风灶，像奇迹一样地使全连炊事用煤由每人每天平均消耗二十八两骤减到二两三钱。各部队如能普遍降低到这个数目，一年就能为国家节省几十万吨煤。因此，各军种、兵种和各军区的代表们，都来向他学习经验。
    去年冬天，六连炊事用煤平均每天每人烧二十八两，远远超过了供给标准。超支的煤要从伙食费中扣钱，伙食也就搞得很不好。士兵们意见很多，有人嘲笑炊事班是“病号班”。为了改变这种情况，连里把共青团员陈恩德等从战斗班调到炊事班做骨干。陈恩德等在炊事班里工作很积极，但是由于继续使用回风灶和旧的烧火方法，烧煤量仍然停留在二十八两左右，陈恩德只是干着急。正在这时候，军士教导连炊事班创造了一种马蹄式炉灶，每天每人只烧八两煤。在全团推广这种炉灶的现场会议上，陈恩德责问自己：“同样是炊事员，人家能想法改炉灶，我们为啥就不能？”
    一回到班里，陈恩德就和团小组长李志才花了好大力气，把原来的回风灶改成了马蹄形回风灶。但是，生起火来一试验，煤总是烧不旺，烟都闷在炉膛里，把全连开饭时间也给耽误了。炊事班长气愤愤地说：“快别瞎搞啦！我当了这么多年炊事班长，也没见过这种灶。”
    受了这一顿闷气，陈恩德有些灰心。但是他想起了团首长在现场会议上说的话：“什么事情开头总会遇到些困难，只要不灰心，就能办成功。”于是，他鼓起勇气，和李志才一起修改。反反复复改了好几次，还是没改好。炊事班长生气了，冲着陈恩德的脸叫起来：“改也是白搭，赶快拆掉！再不拆，耽误了开饭你们负责！”说着，他挽起袖子就要拆灶。陈恩德急得脸都涨红了，他对班长说：“改灶是首长交代的任务，你拆了你负责。如果在前方打仗，没完成任务能停止吗？”这一番话才把班长阻止住。
    只有李志才继续跟陈恩德一起研究，帮助他烧火。为了不影响连里开饭，他们就在晚饭后连夜进行修改。接连三、四天，他们每天都搞到夜里十二点钟以后，睡不一会，到次晨两点半又起来做早饭。疲倦极了，陈恩德和李志才还是互相鼓励着一定要坚持下去。
    正在这时候，连长、指导员到炊事班里来了。连首长鼓励他们继续修改，研究出失败的原因，并指定司务长来协助他们。连长还严肃地批评了炊事班长不该泼冷水。上级一支持，陈恩德的干劲更大了，当场又跳进灶膛里改起来。当天下午，陈恩德偶然发现锅子一提起来，火苗燃得很旺，他思想上豁然亮堂了。原来，马蹄砌得太高了，锅子压住了烟道，炉膛里空气少，所以煤燃烧不起来。他们马上把马蹄修改了一下，使烟路通畅，顿时煤焰就旺了，烧煤量也从二十八两降低到十二两。赶先进的思想使陈恩德和李志才并不满足现有成绩。经过进一步的研究，他们发现炉灶大了一点，火苗不集中，锅底和炉条的距离太远，小火苗不能直接烧到锅底上，他们把炉灶再次做了修改，烧煤量又降到九两。
    这一初步成功，使全班的同志都心服口服了。炊事班长和王师傅在班务会上检讨了自己的错误。全班的思想统一了，班务会马上变成了诸葛亮会，大家你一言我一语，又提出了把灶膛再改小些等等办法。陈恩德也想出一些既省引火柴又省煤的办法。结果，烧煤量又降到六两七钱，六连炊事班由全团最落后的单位一跃而成为最先进的单位。
    在全团评比大会上，陈恩德和六连炊事班受到了表扬，他们的先进经验也被推广起来。团首长号召他们继续找窍门，为国家节约更多的煤。就在这时，自满情绪却像一座大山挡住了他们前进的道路。“办法都想尽了，再也不能节约了。”陈恩德心里这样想，嘴里还是向大家说：“团首长号召再少烧一些，你们看还有什么办法？”这一问，全班都哄嚷起来了，这个说：“不行啦，点子都出完了！”那个说：“再要减少，那就不要烧煤了！”谁也没有认真动脑筋钻研。
    团首长发现六连炊事班停滞不前了，政治处薛主任就特地赶到炊事班里来，给他们算了两笔账：一笔是经济账，节省了煤，可以把钱用到伙食上，使全连的伙食搞得更好；一笔是政治账，他反复说明煤是工业的粮食，节约了煤就能支援国家的工业建设……这些话像炮弹一样轰击着陈恩德和全班同志的心。薛主任看到大家兴奋起来了，就一语道破了大家思想上的病根子。他说：“你们可别自满啊！你们现在是先进单位，可是一停下来，人家就会走到你们头里去。”
    接着，全班连续开了好几次诸葛亮会，进一步从烧煤方法上打主意，大家七凑八凑就想出了八、九样办法。譬如：压火煤用三分之一的煤渣、三分之二的黄土掺起来；压火后马上把冷水倒进锅里，利用锅的热度把水温热，下顿利用温水煮饭、烧菜；把大煤块打碎，用水泡过，第二天烧起来火苗很旺，煤能全部烧透；为了不浪费煤火，要勤看火苗、勤添煤、勤关炉门……这些方法综合运用以后，烧煤量就直线下降到每人每天平均只用二两三钱，比改灶前节约了将近92％。
    陈恩德只读过二年书，以后又过了三年放牛娃子的生活。他改炉节煤的事实，生动地说明了技术不神秘、人人能革新的伟大真理。目前，他和他的炊事班已成为全军节约炊事用煤的旗帜。部队首长特地发出嘉奖命令，决定给予陈恩德晋级晋衔——由列兵晋升为副班级，由上等兵晋升为下士——的奖励，他的同伴李志才荣立一等功，六连炊事班立了集体二等功。
