Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The National Local Metallurgical Industry Conference decided to build 2,000 small copper smelting furnaces in the coming year, with an annual output of more than 150,000 tons of blister copper.

Each of these small copper smelting furnaces has an annual production capacity ranging from 50 tons to 100 tons. The furnace manufacturing is relatively simple and the operation is also relatively easy, which is suitable for the current requirements of the local copper smelting industry.

This year, Hebei Province will utilize manual mining and indigenous smelting in mountainous areas to produce more than 60,000 tons of blister copper for the country. Forty-four counties in this province have discovered copper mines, and thirteen counties plan to produce more than 2,000 tons of blister copper this year. Among them, Pinggu County has decided to produce 5,000 tons of blister copper this year. In addition to the current 5,000 farmers in Pinggu County who are mining copper ore in the mountains, more than 10,000 farmers will participate in copper ore mining after the wheat harvest.

Indigenous copper smelting has also been very successful in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Various copper ores across the country can be smelted using indigenous methods.

Judging from the current trend of vigorously developing the local indigenous copper smelting industry in various places, it is possible to exceed the planned figures for the development of the local copper smelting industry as decided by the National Local Metallurgical Industry Conference in the coming year.

Such large-scale development of the local copper smelting industry will rapidly and rationally utilize the scattered small copper mine resources in various parts of our country and create favorable conditions for vigorously developing our metallurgical industry, electrical machinery industry, and electric power industry.

In Tongdongzi, Sixth District, Qian'an County, Hebei Province, three copper smelting furnaces have been set up, which can smelt 360 jin of blister copper every day. Four hundred such indigenous copper smelting furnaces are to be built here in 1958.

### 大力发展土法炼铜　争取年产粗铜十五万吨  一年内建设两千座小炼铜炉

    大力发展土法炼铜　争取年产粗铜十五万吨
    一年内建设两千座小炼铜炉
    新华社讯　全国地方冶金工业会议决定在今后一年内建成小炼铜炉二千座，年产粗铜在十五万吨以上。
    这些小炼铜炉每座年产能力从五十吨到一百吨不等。炉子制造比较简单，操作也比较容易，适合当前地方炼铜工业的要求。
    今年河北省山区利用手工开采、土法冶炼，要为国家生产粗铜六万多吨。这个省发现有铜矿的县有四十四个，今年计划生产粗铜二千吨以上的县就有十三个，其中平谷县决定今年要生产出五千吨粗铜。平谷县除了目前已有五千农民上山开采铜矿石以外，麦收后还将有一万多农民上山参加铜矿开采工作。
    土法炼铜在四川、云南和贵州等省也进行得很成功。全国各地不同的铜矿石都可以用土法冶炼。
    从目前各地大力发展地方土法炼铜工业的趋势看来，今后一年中有可能超过全国地方冶金工业会议所决定的发展地方炼铜工业的规划数字。
    这样大规模的发展地方炼铜工业，将能迅速地合理地使用我国各地分散的小铜矿资源，并为大力发展我国冶金工业、电机工业和电力工业创造良好的条件。（附图片）
    河北省迁安县在第六区铜洞子已经办起三个炼铜炉，每天可以炼粗铜三百六十斤。一九五八年要在这里建设四百个这种土法炼铜炉。
