Completing the Annual Grain Sales Task in One Go

安徽 Farmers in Feidong County, Anhui, Complete Summer Grain Purchase Plan in Four Days

    (From our newspaper) Buoyed by the Party's General Line and the policy of "five years of unchanged grain purchase," farmers in Shandong Province, having achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest, have swiftly launched an unprecedented, enthusiastic campaign to sell patriotic grain. According to statistics from relevant departments from the 1st to the 15th, the amount of wheat stored throughout the province has reached more than 170 million jin.

    This year, the sale of summer grain has been particularly active in various regions. Many areas and agricultural cooperatives have decided to complete the public grain task as quickly and efficiently as possible in the summer, and to sell more wheat to the state. Many townships and cooperatives in the Jining, Heze, and Liaocheng regions have proposed completing or exceeding the annual purchase task in one go during the summer. The Heze region plans to complete or exceed the annual purchase task in one go during the summer. Due to the unprecedented wheat harvest, Jinxiang County has decided to complete the annual purchase task in one go, after expanding agricultural cooperatives' production investment, increasing public accumulation, and appropriately considering the rations of cooperative members. According to the plans of various townships and cooperatives in Wenshang County, the county's annual purchase task of more than 59 million jin will also be exceeded by more than 2 million jin in one go during the wheat season.

    The scene of summer grain sales this year is very moving. Not only is the quantity large, but the time is also concentrated. On the roads leading to various grain stations, there is a constant flow of traffic, day and night. The earliest areas to store grain were even half a month earlier than in previous years. Many agricultural cooperatives are harvesting, threshing, drying, and cleaning the grain as they go, selling the best first-harvest grain to the state. In Liaocheng region, 17 counties and cities, and more than 2,400 cooperatives, sold more than 79 million jin of wheat in eight days. Among them, 1,567 cooperatives have completed the summer grain purchase task, and 247 cooperatives have completed the annual purchase task in one go.

    Grain departments in various regions have implemented comprehensive cooperation with supply and marketing cooperatives, commercial systems, banks, etc., to overcome the difficulties of tight schedules, few personnel, and insufficient tools. Grain purchase workers in various regions, proceeding from the convenience of the masses and serving production, have gone to the countryside in advance and delved into agricultural cooperatives to inspect and receive grain. Many grain stations have implemented the method of receiving grain as soon as it arrives, day and night, to prevent the masses from waiting in line. Each grain receiving station has also set up shelters and prepared boiled water to warmly receive the grain-delivering masses; some grain receiving stations have also set up medical and health institutions to ensure the health of the grain-delivering masses.

    (From our newspaper) Farmers in Feidong County, Anhui Province, completed the task of delivering public grain and selling surplus grain in the summer in four days. From June 1st to 4th, the amount of grain stored in the county reached 36.2 million jin, exceeding the county's summer grain purchase task by 3.43%. Farmers proudly said: "Delivering public grain and selling surplus grain to support national construction, we take the lead." According to inspection, the quality of this grain is very good.

    Feidong County has achieved a bumper harvest this summer, with grain and oil crops increasing by nearly double compared to last year. Just as farmers throughout the county were celebrating the harvest, the publicity of the General Line of Socialist Construction provided farmers with a universal socialist education. The slogan of "Quickly harvest, quickly thresh, quickly dry, quickly sell" became the practical action of agricultural cooperative members in supporting the General Line. Many townships and cooperatives exceeded their sales tasks overnight. In order to ensure that both production and grain delivery were not delayed, agricultural cooperatives rationally arranged their labor force, with some producing during the day and delivering grain at night, and others dividing into two teams, one for production and one for grain delivery. The task that used to take two months to complete was completed in four days this year.

    一次完成全年粮食交售任务
    山东许多农业社提前交公粮超额卖余粮
    安徽肥东县农民四天完成夏粮征购计划
    本报讯  获得小麦空前大丰收的山东省农民，在党的总路线和粮食包购五年不变的政策的鼓舞下，迅速展开了前所未有的踊跃交售爱国粮的活动。据有关部门1日到15日的统计，全省入库小麦已达一亿七千多万斤。
    今年各地交售夏粮显得特别活跃，许多地区和农业社纷纷决定在夏季要尽快尽好地完成公粮任务和多卖小麦给国家。济宁、菏泽、聊城等专区的许多乡、社都提出在夏季一次完成和超额完成全年的征购任务。菏泽专区准备把全年的包购任务在夏季一次完成或超额完成。金乡县由于小麦空前丰收，决定在扩大农业社生产投资、增加公共积累，并适当照顾社员口粮的情况下，一次完成全年征购任务。据汶上县各乡、社的计划，全县全年五千九百多万斤的征购任务，也将在麦季一次超额二百余万斤完成。
    今年各地交售夏粮的情景十分令人感动，不但数量大，而且时间集中，在通往各粮站的道路上，不分昼夜，车水马龙。入库最早的地区竟比往年提前了半个月。许多农业社都是随收随打，晒干扬净，把最好的头遍粮卖给国家。聊城专区十七个县市、二千四百多个社，八天内即交售小麦七千九百多万斤。其中有一千五百六十七个社已完成夏粮征购任务，有二百四十七个社已一次完成全年征购任务。
    各地粮食部门与供销社、商业系统、银行等实行全面协作，克服了任务挤、人员少和工具不足的困难。各地粮食征购工作人员一切从便利群众，服务生产出发，做到了提前下乡，深入农业社验粮接粮。许多粮站实行随到随收，昼夜不停的办法，不让群众排队等待。各个收粮站并搭了凉棚，准备开水，热情接待送粮群众；有些接粮站还设立了医疗卫生机构，以保证送粮群众的健康。
    本报讯  安徽省肥东县农民四天完成了夏季交公粮、卖余粮的任务。6月1日到4日的四天中，全县入库粮食达三千六百二十万斤，超过了全县夏粮征购任务的3.43％。农民自豪地说：“交公粮、卖余粮，支援国家建设，我们一马当先”。据检查，这些粮食质量很好。
    肥东县今年夏季大丰收，粮食作物和油料作物比去年增产近一倍。正当全县农民欢庆丰收时，社会主义建设总路线的宣传使农民受到了一次普遍的社会主义教育。“快收、快打、快晒、快交售”的口号成了农业社员们拥护总路线的实际行动。许多乡、社在一夜之间就超额完成了交售任务。为使生产、送粮两不误，农业社合理安排了劳力，有的白天生产晚上送粮，有的分成两套班子，一班生产一班送粮。往年要两个月才能完成的任务，今年四天就完成了。
