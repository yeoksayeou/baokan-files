Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to a comprehensive report by our newspaper, the special meeting of the Arab League Council held in Benghazi, the capital of Libya, to study the Lebanese government's "accusation case" against the United Arab Republic, convened on May 31, concluded on the morning of June 6.

The special meeting did not pass any resolutions because the Lebanese government rejected the draft resolution proposed by the Council. The draft resolution included four points: requiring the Lebanese government to withdraw its accusations against the United Arab Republic submitted to the Security Council; ceasing all actions that are detrimental to the friendly relations between Arab countries; appealing to all levels of people in Lebanon to stop bloodshed and resolve their disputes through peaceful and legitimate means; and dispatching an Arab League delegation to Lebanon to mediate.

Originally, the delegations of various countries attending the meeting had voted to approve this draft resolution on the 4th. The United Arab Republic and Lebanon, as the two parties in the dispute, did not have the right to vote, and the delegations of these two countries submitted the draft resolution to their respective governments for a decision. The United Arab Republic government authorized its delegation on the 6th to approve the four-point draft resolution. However, the Lebanese government notified its delegation on the evening of the 5th that it rejected the draft resolution. The heads of the Iraqi and Jordanian delegations also withdrew their previous approval of the draft resolution.

Subsequently, a suggestion from the head of the Sudanese delegation, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahgoub, urging the Council to appeal to members of both the Lebanese government and the insurgents to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, was also rejected by the Lebanese delegation.

The head of the United Arab Republic delegation, Fami, said at the meeting: "The Lebanese government has never been in favor of submitting the issue to the Arab League for resolution. It raised the issue here only as a routine step so that it could go to the Security Council and say that the Arab League, as a regional organization, cannot solve this problem."

At a press conference held after the meeting, Fami said that some foreigners insisted on turning Lebanon's internal affairs into an international issue.

The Director of the Information Bureau of the United Arab Republic, Afla, stated that the Lebanese government had prepared in advance to reject any resolutions that the Arab League Council might reach in order to make it possible to submit the Lebanese issue to the Security Council. Afla emphasized that the Lebanese issue could never be resolved in the Security Council, but only by the Lebanese people themselves on Lebanese territory.

Afla pointed out that foreign armed intervention had already taken place in Lebanon.

Many newspapers in Cairo published editorials on the 7th strongly condemning the actions of the current Lebanese government in Benghazi. "The Republic" said that the sole purpose of the Lebanese government was to create a situation where foreign countries had an excuse to intervene in its internal affairs and hoped to prolong the life of the current regime.

    黎巴嫩政府制造外国干涉口实
    顽拒撤回对阿联的诬告
    阿拉伯联盟理事会特别会议闭幕
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿拉伯联盟理事会在利比亚首都班加西召开的特别会议已经在6日上午闭幕。这次会议是为了研究黎巴嫩政府对阿拉伯联合共和国的“控诉案”而在5月31日召开的。
    特别会议没有通过任何决议，因为黎巴嫩政府拒绝了理事会提出的决议草案。决议草案包括四点：要求黎巴嫩政府撤回向安理会提出的对阿拉伯联合共和国的控诉；停止一切不利于阿拉伯国家之间的友好关系的行动；向黎巴嫩各阶层人民呼吁停止流血而通过和平合法的手段来解决他们的争端；派遣阿拉伯联盟代表团到黎巴嫩去进行调解。
    本来，与会的各国代表团已经在4日投票批准了这个决议草案。阿拉伯联合共和国和黎巴嫩作为争执的双方没有权利投票，这两个国家的代表团把决议草案提交它们的政府作决定。阿拉伯联合共和国政府6日授权它的代表团批准四点决议草案。但黎巴嫩政府5日晚上却通知它的代表团说，它拒绝这个决议草案。伊拉克和约旦的代表团团长也撤回了他们以前对这个决议草案的批准。
    随后，苏丹代表团团长、苏丹外交部长马哈古卜建议理事会呼吁黎巴嫩政府和起义者双方面的成员通过和平的办法解决他们的争端，也遭到黎巴嫩代表团的拒绝。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团长法米在会议上说：“黎巴嫩政府本来就不赞成把问题提交阿拉伯联盟来解决。它在这里提出这个问题，只是作为一个例行的步骤，以便它可以到安全理事会去，并且在那里说甚么作为区域性组织的阿拉伯联盟不能解决这个问题。”
    法米在会议结束后举行的记者招待会上说，有一些外国人坚持要把黎巴嫩的内政问题变为国际问题。
    阿拉伯联合共和国新闻局局长阿弗拉发表意见说，黎巴嫩政府事先就准备好了拒绝任何阿拉伯联盟理事会可能达成的决议，以便有可能把黎巴嫩问题提交安全理事会。阿弗拉强调说，黎巴嫩问题在安全理事会绝不能得到解决，而只有在黎巴嫩领土上由黎巴嫩人自己去解决。
    阿弗拉指出，现在在黎巴嫩已经发生了外国武装干涉的事情。
    开罗许多报纸都在7日发表社论强烈谴责黎巴嫩现政府在班加西的作法。“共和国报”说，黎巴嫩政府唯一的目的是要制造一个局面，使得外国有借口来干涉它的内政，并且希望以此来延长现政权的寿命。
