“What People Live By,” written by the 19th-century Polish socialist Dyksterhuis, has recently been reprinted by Popular Reading Publishing House in Chinese translation. This is a popular political economy booklet, mainly about a core issue in Marxist economics, namely the theory of surplus value. The author's writing method is from concrete to abstract, from shallow to deep, and is very engaging. For someone who has not studied political economy, it is a good introductory reading.

The author of this book was a 19th-century proletarian fighter, whom Plekhanov praised as a person who "did not live for his own life, but sacrificed himself to seek the happiness of the working class." This book has been translated into nine languages. The Soviet academic community has a very high evaluation of this book, believing that it still maintains cognitive value, and that it can serve as an example of the popularization of Marxist knowledge in many respects.

    “人依靠什么来生活”出版
    “人依靠什么来生活”是十九世纪波兰社会主义者狄柯司特因所写的，中译本新近已由通俗读物出版社重印出版。这是一本通俗政治经济学的小册子，主要是讲马克思主义经济学中的一个核心问题，即剩余价值理论的问题。作者的写作方法是从具体到抽象，由浅入深，引人入胜。对于一个没有学过政治经济学的人，它是一本很好的入门读物。
    这本书的作者是十九世纪一位无产阶级的战士，普列汉诺夫曾称赞他“不是为自己的生活，而是牺牲自己来求得工人阶级的幸福”的人。这本书先后曾译成九国文字。苏联的学术界对这本书有很高的评价，认为至今它还保持着认识上的价值，而且它在很多方面都可以作为马克思主义知识通俗化的范例。
