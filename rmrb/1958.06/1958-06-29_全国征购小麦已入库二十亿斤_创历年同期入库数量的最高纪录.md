Xinhua News Agency, 28th: This year's wheat procurement and storage is progressing rapidly. By June 15th, the nation had already stored 2.16 billion jin of wheat, an increase of 172.43% over the same period last year, creating the highest record for wheat storage in the same period since the founding of the country.

This year's agricultural production has seen a great leap forward, with an unprecedented wheat harvest. Inspired by the general line of socialist construction, the broad masses of farmers are filled with enthusiasm, delivering summer grain with gongs and drums, and rapidly setting off a high tide of wheat procurement and storage. At present, in some areas south of the Yangtze River, the procurement and storage work is nearing its end. In the provinces with bumper wheat harvests, such as Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui, the procurement and storage work will also successively enter a tense stage. Considering the busy agricultural production, the large amount of wheat procurement and storage, and the short time frame, most areas have properly organized large-scale labor cooperation, taking advantage of production gaps to rush the delivery of grain. Agricultural cooperative members in Xianning County, Hubei Province, produced during the day and delivered grain at night, vigorously organizing large-scale labor cooperation between cooperatives, and completed the county's summer grain procurement task in ten days, truly achieving no delay in both production and grain delivery.

The grain departments in various regions have also done a good job in procurement and storage. Many areas have achieved immediate acceptance upon arrival. Hubei Province has promoted the "five on-site" procurement method: on-site at the vehicle, on-site at the boat, on-site along the transportation route, on-site at the agricultural cooperative, achieving quick collection, quick transportation, and simultaneous collection and transportation. Grain departments in some areas have actively helped agricultural cooperatives organize transportation forces and solve difficulties such as packaging materials, which has been warmly welcomed by the masses.

However, according to reports from Zhejiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces, as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the procurement progress in some areas is currently relatively slow. One reason is that some grassroots cadres in some areas mistakenly believe that after the implementation of the grain purchase and sales method, there are no more problems with grain work, thus fostering complacency and relaxation, and relaxing the summer grain procurement work. Some cadres in other areas have feelings of fear and difficulty, and have been slow to allocate procurement tasks to the cooperatives. Another reason is that the arrangements for grain delivery and production have not been properly coordinated. These problems have attracted attention in various regions, and measures are being actively taken to solve them.

    全国征购小麦已入库二十亿斤
    创历年同期入库数量的最高纪录
    新华社28日讯　今年小麦征购入库进度很快。到6月15日，全国已入库小麦二十点一六亿斤，比上年同期增加172.43％，创建国以来各年同期小麦入库数量的最高纪录。
    今年农业生产大跃进，小麦空前丰收。广大农民在社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，热情高涨，敲锣打鼓送交夏粮，迅速掀起了小麦征购入库的高潮。目前，长江以南有些地区征购入库工作已接近尾声。小麦大丰收的河南、山东、江苏、安徽等省，征购入库工作也即将陆续进入紧张阶段。根据农业生产繁忙、小麦征购入库数量大、时间短等情况，大部分地区都妥善组织劳力大协作，利用生产空隙时间突击送粮。湖北省咸宁县的农业社员，白天生产，晚上送粮，大力组织社与社之间的劳力大协作，十天就完成了全县夏粮征购任务，真正做到生产、送粮两不误。
    各地粮食部门征购入库工作做得也较好。不少地区做到随来随收。湖北省推广了就车、就船、就公路线、就农业社的“五就”收购方法，做到快收、快运、边收边运。有些地区的粮食部门主动帮助农业社组织运输力量，解决包装器材等困难问题，受到群众热烈欢迎。
    但是，据浙江、云南、贵州等省和广西僮族自治区反映，目前也有部分地区征购进度比较迟缓。一个原因是部分地区的基层干部，错误地认为实行粮食购销办法以后，粮食工作没有什么问题了，因而滋长了麻痹松劲情绪，放松了夏粮征购工作。还有部分地区的干部存在着畏难情绪，迟迟没有把征购任务分配到社。另一个原因，是对送粮与生产没有统一安排好。对这些问题，各地已引起注意，正在积极采取措施解决。
