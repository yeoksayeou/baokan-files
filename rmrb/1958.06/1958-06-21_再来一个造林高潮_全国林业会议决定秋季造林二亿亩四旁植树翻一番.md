Another Afforestation Upsurge
National Forestry Conference Decides to Afforest 200 Million Mu in Autumn and Quadruple Sideline Tree Planting

(Our report) During the Second Five-Year Plan period, China will afforest 1.8 billion mu and plant 130 billion trees around houses and along roads and rivers. The country will be basically greened (except for border areas) in five years. We will strive to establish China's forestry production on a new technical foundation in five years or a little longer, in order to ensure socialist construction with abundant timber production. The Ministry of Forestry recently held a national conference of directors of forestry departments in Beijing. According to the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the general line of the socialist construction period, the conference summarized the forestry work of the past eight years, exchanged experiences, and initially determined the tasks in the Second Five-Year Plan and the planning indicators for 1959.

The meeting held that the forestry construction policy in the past eight years has been basically correct, and the achievements are the main aspect. In terms of greening, as of May this year, 500 million mu of afforestation has been completed, and more than 100 million cubic meters of timber have been harvested, which basically guaranteed the construction needs of the First Five-Year Plan. However, there are profound lessons in the "saddle-shaped" pattern of forestry work. In the production upsurge of 1956, more than 75 million mu of afforestation was completed; in 1957, only 58.5 million mu was afforested; and in the spring of 1958, afforestation reached 315 million mu, and sideline tree planting reached 13.3 billion trees. Under the influence of right-leaning conservative thinking, there was insufficient reliance on the masses and the mass line in developing forestry construction. There were also doubts about whether agricultural production cooperatives could supply the state with timber for construction; state-owned forest farms inappropriately emphasized the construction of single-purpose timber forests; and the management of forests was set against the utilization of forests, with one-sided forest protection, while insufficient attention was paid to the comprehensive utilization of forest resources. In timber harvesting and management, there was also a lack of boldness in technological innovation, and insufficient utilization of forest resources. Some rules and regulations were also excessively rigid, restricting the enthusiasm of the masses.

The conference listened to more than 30 typical reports, introduced advanced experiences, enriched forestry content, pointed out that forestry construction is related to the development of the entire mountainous area, and played a huge role in the future development of forestry.

The meeting held that forestry departments at all levels must, under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, implement the general line, combine it with the central tasks, and organize a new upsurge in forestry construction. This year is a new turning point in forestry construction, and the people of the whole country have shown great strength in the spring afforestation campaign. The meeting decided to launch a broader afforestation upsurge in the autumn, striving to afforest another 200 million mu and quadruple sideline tree planting again. In the large-scale afforestation movement, it is necessary to vigorously carry out tool reform and technological innovation, and universally promote the working method of planting experimental fields. Pay attention to the creativity and advanced experience of the masses, and summarize and promote them in a timely manner; hold on-site meetings, organize visits and comparisons, encourage the masses, and strive for progress. At present, it is necessary to focus on the tending of young forests, so that the new generation of seedlings can grow up healthily. (Attached picture)

### 再来一个造林高潮  全国林业会议决定秋季造林二亿亩四旁植树翻一番

    再来一个造林高潮
    全国林业会议决定秋季造林二亿亩四旁植树翻一番
    本报讯　我国在第二个五年计划期间要造林十八亿亩，完成四旁植树一千三百亿株，五年基本绿化全国（除边疆地区而外）；争取五年或者更多一点时间，把我国林业生产建立在新的技术基础上，以充裕的木材生产来保证社会主义建设。林业部最近在北京召开了全国林业厅局长会议，根据中共中央八大二次会议的精神和社会主义建设时期总路线，总结了八年来的林业工作，交流了经验，并初步决定了上述第二个五年计划中的任务和1959年的规划指标。
    会议认为，八年来林业建设方针基本上是正确的，成绩是主要的。在绿化方面，截至今年5月份，完成造林五亿亩，采伐木材一亿多立方公尺，基本上保证了第一个五年计划建设需要。但是，林业工作中存在着马鞍形的深刻教训。1956年生产高潮时，完成造林七千五百多万亩；1957年仅造林五千八百五十万亩；1958年春季造林已达三亿一千五百万亩，四旁植树达一百三十三亿株。在右倾保守思想的影响下，在发展林业建设中，依靠群众走群众路线也是不够的，对农业生产合作社造林也能供应国家用材，抱有怀疑态度；对国营林场不恰当地强调营造单一用材林；把经营森林和利用森林对立起来，片面地进行森林管护，而对全面利用森林资源则抓的不够。在木材采伐和管理上也不敢大胆革新技术，对森林资源的充分利用也不够。还有些规章制度过分死板，限制了群众积极性。
    会议听取了三十多个典型报告，介绍了先进经验，丰富了林业内容，指出了林业建设关系到整个山区发展的问题，对今后发展林业起了极大作用。
    会议认为，各级林业工作部门，必须在各级党委和政府的领导下，贯彻执行总路线，结合中心任务，组织林业建设新的高潮。今年是林业建设中的一个新的转折点，春季造林运动中，全国人民表现出了雄伟的力量。会议决定秋季再掀起一个更加广阔的造林高潮，争取再造林二亿亩，四旁植树再翻一番。在大规模造林运动中，要大力开展工具改革和技术革新运动，普遍推广种试验田的工作方法。重视群众的创造和先进经验，并且及时加以总结和推广；开好现场会议，组织参观评比，鼓舞群众，力争上游。目前要抓紧幼林抚育工作，让新生的一代幼苗健康地成长起来。（附图片）
