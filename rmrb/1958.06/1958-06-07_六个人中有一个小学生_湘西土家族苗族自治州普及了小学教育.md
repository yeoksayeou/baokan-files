Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 6th: In the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, where not a single child in mountain villages went to school before liberation, primary education has now been basically universalized, with 90.7% of school-age children of all ethnic groups attending primary school.

According to statistics from the autonomous prefecture's education department, there are currently 3,721 primary schools in the prefecture, averaging one to two schools per agricultural cooperative. The number of children of all ethnic groups enrolled in schools throughout the prefecture has reached 275,400, more than twenty times the number in the early days of liberation, averaging one primary school student for every six people.

Before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture lived in extreme poverty, making it impossible to attend school. The entire mountain area was almost entirely illiterate. After liberation, the Party and the state helped the Tujia and Miao farmers establish primary schools in the mountainous areas, enrolling a large number of minority children. Last year, the number of primary schools established in the villages throughout the prefecture reached 1,787, with 200,300 children enrolled, including nearly 100,000 Tujia and Miao students. This year, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups for running schools has reached unprecedented heights. In just one month, around the beginning of May, 1,934 new primary schools were established in the deep mountains, with 72,328 newly enrolled children of all ethnic groups. Currently, the education department of the autonomous prefecture is transferring 386 graduates of various ethnic groups from this year's summer middle and primary teacher training programs to the deep mountains to help consolidate these community-run primary schools.

　　六个人中有一个小学生
    湘西土家族苗族自治州普及了小学教育
    新华社长沙6日电　在解放前几十里山寨没有一个儿童上学的湘西土家族苗族自治州，现在已基本上普及了小学教育，90.7％的各族学龄儿童都进入了小学念书。
    据自治州教育部门统计，目前全州有小学校三千七百二十一所，平均每个农业社有一所到二所；全州入学的各族儿童达二十七万五千四百多人，比解放初期增加二十多倍，平均每六个人中就有一个小学生。
    解放前，自治州各族人民生活极端贫困，根本没有可能上学读书，整个山区几乎都是文盲。解放后，党和国家帮助土家族和苗族农民在山区普遍建立小学，吸收大批少数民族儿童入学念书。去年，全州在山寨里建立的小学校已达一千七百八十七所，入学儿童二十万零三百多人，其中土家族和苗族学生近十万人。今年，在大跃进的形势下，各族农民办学干劲空前高涨，仅在5月初前后的一个月中，就在深山中新建立了小学一千九百三十四所，新入学的各族儿童有七万二千三百二十八人。目前，自治州教育部门正在调派今年暑期中、初级师范三百八十六个各族毕业生赶赴深山，帮助巩固这批民办小学。
