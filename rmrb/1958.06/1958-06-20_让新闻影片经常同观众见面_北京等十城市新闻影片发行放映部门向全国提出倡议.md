Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 19th: The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture held an on-site conference on the work of news cinemas in Tianjin from the 15th to the 17th.

The heads of the newsreel distribution and projection departments of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and seven other cities participating in the meeting, put forward an initiative to all systems and types of cinemas and film projection teams across the country to strengthen the projection of news, documentary, and scientific education films, requiring timely, regular, universal, and in-depth projection, with every cinema projecting them, every team projecting them, and every screening including (added) them.

News documentaries are short, lively, and rich in content, and can promptly reflect the face of socialist construction, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people. Many viewers regard news documentaries as "textbooks" for improving their political awareness and ideological level, and call news cinemas "political classrooms and technical schools." In recent years, news documentaries and scientific education films have developed greatly. In February 1957, there were only thirteen news cinemas nationwide, but by the end of this year, this will increase to more than fifty. In 1954, Tianjin established China's first news cinema, with an average of only more than 3,000 viewers per day; this year, Tianjin has developed to three news cinemas and three branch cinemas, with an average of more than 10,000 viewers per day.

When exchanging experiences at the on-site meeting, the representatives of various regions unanimously affirmed that: distinct political and fighting characteristics are the characteristics of news documentaries, and it is a powerful weapon for the Party to conduct socialist education for the people. In recent years, it has achieved great success in coordinating political movements and inspiring the socialist construction enthusiasm of the broad masses.

Many people said at the meeting that the facts that newsreels powerfully cooperate with the Party's political tasks and are warmly welcomed by the audience have deeply educated them, reversed their past one-sided views of emphasizing feature films and neglecting newsreels, and strengthened their confidence in developing the news film industry. Many news cinemas have also paid attention to combining politics when holding "special screenings of science and technology films."

Representatives from various regions focused on exchanging experiences in news film projection work at the meeting.

    让新闻影片经常同观众见面
    北京等十城市新闻影片发行放映部门向全国提出倡议
    据新华社天津19日电　文化部电影事业管理局15日到17日在天津召开新闻电影院工作现场会议。
    参加会议的北京、上海、天津等十个城市的新闻影片发行、放映部门的负责人，向全国各系统、各类型的电影院和电影放映队提出了加强新闻、纪录、科学教育影片放映工作的倡议，要求及时、经常、普遍、深入地放映，院院放映，队队放映，场场放（加）映。
    新闻纪录电影短小活泼，内容丰富生动，能够及时地反映社会主义建设面貌，已经受到广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。许多观众把新闻纪录影片看作是提高他们政治觉悟和思想水平的“教科书”，把新闻影院称为“政治课堂，技术学校”。几年来，各地新闻纪录和科学教育电影有了很大发展。1957年2月全国还只有新闻影院十三所，今年年底将增加到五十多所。1954年，天津市成立了我国第一座新闻影院，平均每天只有观众三千多人次；今年天津市发展到三所新闻影院和三所分院，平均每天有观众一万多人次。
    各地代表在现场会议上交流经验时一致肯定：鲜明的政治性和战斗性是新闻纪录影片的特色，它是党对人民进行社会主义教育的有力武器。几年来，它在配合政治运动、鼓舞广大群众的社会主义建设热情等方面取得了很大成绩。
    许多人在会上说，新闻影片有力地配合党的政治任务、获得观众热烈欢迎这些事实深深教育了他们，扭转了他们过去轻新闻影片、重故事影片的片面观点，加强了他们对发展新闻电影事业的信心。不少新闻影院在举办“科学技术影片专场”时，也已注意结合政治。
    各地代表在会上着重交流了新闻电影放映工作的经验。
