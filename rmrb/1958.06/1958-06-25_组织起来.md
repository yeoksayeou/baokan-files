Beijing Daily Editorial, June 24th

    Chairman Mao's policy of "organize!" put forward in 1943 for the production movement in the liberated areas at that time, also has great practical significance for the current industrial development of Beijing. The policy of "organize!" is the policy of mobilizing all positive factors, that is, the policy of fully mobilizing the masses. Our establishment of an automobile and tractor industrial system in Beijing is carried out under the great slogan of "organize!". As long as we fully mobilize the masses, mobilize and organize all favorable factors, and implement comprehensive cooperation, we can double the results with half the effort and speed up the pace of the capital's industrial construction.

    In order to strive to build Beijing into a modern industrial base within five years, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is taking a series of major organizational and cooperative measures in accordance with the principles of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, including: launching a mass movement to support industrial construction; organizing old factories to build new factories by using the "laying eggs" method; turning many repair departments into manufacturing enterprises or repair-cum-manufacturing enterprises; allowing factories of all sizes to upgrade their product grades, scales, and enterprise nature level by level under the overall planning. Recently, the Municipal Committee has convened a series of cooperation meetings to organize automobile, tractor, machine tool, radio, chemical and other industrial systems one by one, determine their scale and product direction, and clarify the division of labor and cooperation between relevant large, medium and small factories, schools, and scientific research institutions. These measures have shown initial results. We can see that as long as we organize, production capacity will be improved, products that could not be made in the past can be made, and technical problems that could not be solved in the past can also be solved. It is true that "organization brings great strength."

    It is very important today to reorganize Beijing's existing industry according to the principles of "centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation."

    If we want to strive to turn Beijing into a modern industrial base in just five years, this means that we must establish a series of strong modern industrial systems, master the cutting-edge technologies of modern industry, and be able to manufacture heavy, complex, and precision high-end products. However, Beijing's current industrial base is quite weak compared with this task. Except for a few departments that have a certain foundation (such as coal, iron smelting, radio, textiles, etc.), most departments only have some scattered, small and medium-sized factories and cooperatives with low technical levels. How can we build Beijing into a modern industrial base in a short period of time on this rather weak foundation? Of course, we must build a large number of large, medium and small factories at the fastest speed and establish new industrial departments, especially the "brain" and backbone of modern industry. However, if we completely adopt the method of building from scratch to build those modern industrial systems we have planned, we will not be able to complete this huge task in a faster, better and more economical way. Because building a new modern factory requires millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of yuan in investment, thousands of technicians and workers, and hundreds and thousands of pieces of equipment. How much capital, equipment and technical strength will it take to build so many factories that we have planned! Obviously, we cannot come up with so much strength in the short term; at the same time, building everything from scratch also takes a considerable amount of time. What method can we use to solve this problem at the fastest speed? Only by adopting the policy of "organize!". Beijing has more than a thousand old factories of all sizes, as well as many handicraft cooperatives, especially many higher industrial schools, secondary technical schools, the Academy of Sciences, and research institutes and design institutes affiliated to the central industrial ministries. As long as we organize these forces, make overall plans, divide labor and cooperate, while building new industrial backbones, let those factories produce on the existing basis while carrying out necessary expansions, and ask scientific institutions, design institutions and universities to provide technical assistance, we may be able to achieve the goal with much less investment and several times faster speed.

    On the other hand, since the central government proposed the great development of local industry, Beijing's industry has presented a lively situation of blooming flowers. Factories are being built everywhere in urban and rural areas. Many factories, cooperatives and even schools are trying out new products day and night. The broad masses have given play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, creating many outstanding achievements and promoting the great leap forward in Beijing's industry. Under this situation, how can we most effectively give play to the enthusiasm of each unit and the broad masses? If we adopt a policy of letting it develop freely, industry will certainly develop, but some side effects will inevitably occur, such as: some factories are doing the same product, while some other products that the country urgently needs are not being done; two factories could have cooperated to manufacture more advanced products, but due to "going it alone," they can only produce relatively low-level products separately; some equipment and materials in one factory are idle and stockpiled, while another factory is shut down due to lack of these things, and so on. It may even form some blind development and free competition, thus causing waste, delaying the speed of industrial development, and dampening the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the policy of "organize!", organize the enthusiasm of the masses, organize the forces of all parties, concentrate leadership, make overall plans, divide labor and cooperate, so that all forces conducive to industrial development are fully utilized, and the high degree of enthusiasm of the masses is closely combined with the overall planning of the state, so that the enthusiasm of the masses can be most fully and sustainedly developed on a solid foundation. The initial formation of the automobile and tractor industrial system also proves this point. Originally, eight units were simultaneously trial-producing automobiles and tractors, but some of these models were not the most needed at present, some models were very similar, and due to insufficient equipment and technical strength, it was difficult for each factory to quickly produce in large quantities by itself; after organizing cooperation, the models were simplified, labor was divided, and mutual support was provided, so that they could switch to batch production in a short period of time.

    Reorganizing industry in accordance with the policy of "organize!" also has a more profound political and economic significance. In essence, industrial reorganization is a continuation of the socialist revolution in the relations of production. Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "socialist relations of production have been established in our country, and they are adapted to the development of productive forces; however, they are still very imperfect, and these imperfect aspects are contradictory to the development of productive forces." This analysis is also completely in line with the situation in Beijing's industry. In terms of ownership, calculated by the output value in 1957, 60% belonged to state-owned and local state-owned, 23% belonged to joint state-private ownership, and 17% belonged to handicraft cooperatives. In essence, although these are all socialist economies, there is a boundary between them due to different ownership systems, and a comprehensive direct plan and planning have not been implemented, which to some extent restricts the development of productive forces. On the other hand, in terms of the interrelationship between production and exchange in various economic sectors, it is also "gradually being established and gradually finding more appropriate forms in accordance with socialist principles." For example, as far as the division of labor and cooperation relationship between various state-owned enterprises in Beijing is concerned, although it has developed somewhat in recent years, it is still very imperfect and has not reached a high degree of organization. The industrial reorganization currently underway is precisely to continue to solve these problems. It includes three main contents: First, to continue to carry out socialist transformation of some joint state-private enterprises and handicraft cooperatives. For example, in recent months, 108 handicraft cooperatives in Beijing have been upgraded to cooperative factories, with a total of 16,000 employees, and the annual output value accounts for one-third of the total handicraft output value. After the transfer, the shares are returned, and labor dividends are changed to a wage system. Second, to turn some small enterprises into components of modern large-scale industry. Third, to divide labor among various similar factories and form a system of rational division of labor and close cooperation. Therefore, industrial reorganization is also a component of continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic front. Carrying out such a reorganization will make the socialist relations of production in industry more consolidated and more perfect, and social productive forces will inevitably be further liberated, and the superiority of the socialist system will also be further brought into play.

    Like all revolutions in the relations of production, industrial reorganization will also be reflected in the ideological field and bring about struggles on the ideological front. However, today in our country, the public ownership of the means of production occupies a dominant position in industry. Therefore, the struggle between the remnants of capitalist relations of production and socialist relations of production will mainly be reflected as an ideological struggle: one side of the struggle is the communist spirit of cooperation; the other side of the struggle is various forms of departmentalism and sectarianism. We can see that the vast majority of enterprise leading cadres and workers have a high degree of communist spirit of cooperation. This is in line with the interests of socialist production. One of the most fundamental characteristics of socialist society is a high degree of cooperative relations. It is different from capitalist cooperation. Capitalism also has cooperation, but it is cooperation built on the basis of profit relations, which is a relationship of mutual exploitation, deception, and fraud. Its basis is the private ownership of the means of production, and what plays a leading role is free competition, mutual annexation, and anarchy. In the final analysis, it is the exploitation and oppression of the working people by the capitalists, and the result is inevitably a huge waste of production capacity and stagnation of production development. In socialist society, the means of production are publicly owned, and the fundamental interests of the people are consistent. Therefore, there is a real basis for a high degree of cooperation, and everyone works together to promote the rapid development of production. The smooth progress of Beijing's industrial reorganization, the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers for this reorganization, and their close coordination and support for each other, even at the expense of partial interests to achieve the overall situation, is a vivid proof.

    However, we also see that in the initial stage of socialist society, as Lenin said, there are still many "fragments" of capitalist society. The departmentalism and sectarianism that exist in some people are part of these "fragments." Their manifestations in the process of industrial reorganization are that they are not active in cooperation and are unwilling to develop industry under the principle of "centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation." Some people want to be "individual households" in modern industry. Although there are very few or even no individual households in agriculture, there are still people in industry who are interested in "going it alone." They are always unwilling to cooperate with others, dislike the trouble of cooperation, and dislike the lack of "style" in cooperation. They want to make themselves an all-round factory, want to ask for nothing from others, and want to "become a system by themselves." What are the benefits of this "each doing his own thing" other than wasting funds, equipment, manpower, delaying construction progress, and creating artificial imbalances? There are also people who only want to play the leading role in cooperation and are unwilling to play the supporting role. That is to say, they are unwilling to engage in small products, and are willing to engage in important products with high output value, and are unwilling to engage in products with low output value, and so on. Of course, everyone wants to play a greater role in industrial construction and make greater contributions. This idea is natural and correct; however, the idea of only being able to play the leading role and not being able to play the supporting role is illogical. In fact, playing the leading role and playing the supporting role are relative. Those who play the leading role in a local area are supporting roles in the overall area; and those who play the supporting role in the overall area are the leading roles in the local area. In the entire industrial system, both the leading role and the supporting role are needed, just like a machine cannot do without screws. As for who plays the leading role and who plays the supporting role, it needs to be determined according to the specific conditions. The part must obey the whole. Everyone should take care of the overall situation.

    The various erroneous ideas mentioned above do not occupy a dominant position today, but they hinder the smooth organization of socialist cooperation, hinder the rapid reorganization of industry, and thus hinder the further development of industry. Therefore, we must use the communist spirit of cooperation as the commander and sweep away all ideas that are not conducive to cooperation.

    组织起来
    北京日报六月二十四日社论
    毛主席在1943年针对当时解放区生产运动提出的“组织起来”的方针，对于当前北京工业的发展，也有着巨大的现实意义。“组织起来”的方针，也就是调动一切积极因素的方针，也就是充分发动群众的方针。我们在北京建立汽车拖拉机工业体系，就是在“组织起来”的伟大口号下进行的。只要我们充分发动群众，把一切有利的因素调动起来，组织起来，实行全面大协作，就可以事半功倍地加快首都工业建设的速度。
    为了争取在五年内把北京建设成一个现代化工业基地，中共北京市委正在根据集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的方针，采取一系列重大的组织协作的措施，包括：发动一个全民支援工业建设的运动；组织老厂用下蛋的办法来建设新厂；把许多修理部门变成制造企业或者修理兼制造的企业；让大大小小的工厂在通盘的规划之下，在产品等级、规模和企业性质上层层升级等。最近市委召开了一系列的协作会议，来逐一组织汽车拖拉机、机床、无线电、化工等工业体系，确定它们的规模和产品方向，明确各有关大中小厂和学校、科学研究机关的分工和协作关系。这些措施已经显示出初步成效。我们可以看到，只要一组织起来，生产能力就提高了，过去不能做的产品能够做了，过去解决不了的技术问题也能够解决了，真是“组织起来力量大”。
    按照“集中领导、全面规划、分工协作”的原则来改组北京的现有工业，在今天显得十分重要。
    我们要在短短五年内争取把北京变成一个现代化工业基地，这就意味着要建立一系列强大的现代化工业体系，要掌握现代工业的尖端技术，要能够制造重型的、复杂的、精密的高级产品。而北京目前的工业基础，同这个任务对比起来，却相当薄弱。除了少数部门有了一定的基础（如煤炭、炼铁、无线电、纺织等）以外，多数部门只有一些零散的、技术水平不高的中小型工厂和合作社。怎样在这个相当薄弱的基础上在短期内把北京建成现代化工业基地呢？当然要以最快的速度，来建设一大批大中小型工厂，建立起新的工业部门，特别要建设起现代工业的头脑和骨干。但是，假如完全采取从头新建的办法来建设我们所规划的那些现代化的工业体系，我们就不可能多快好省地完成这个巨大的任务。因为，要新建一个现代化的工厂，就需要几百万、几千万以至几亿元的投资，几千个技术人员和工人，成百成千台的设备。要建设我们所规划的那么多的工厂，该需要多少资金、设备和技术力量呵！显然，在短期内我们不可能拿出这么多力量来；同时，样样都从头建设，也需要相当长的时间。我们用什么办法才能够用最快的速度解决这个难题呢？只有采取“组织起来”的方针。北京市有一千多个大大小小的老厂，还有很多手工业合作社，特别是有很多高等工业学校、中等技术学校，有科学院和中央各工业部所属的研究所、设计院。我们只要把这些力量组织起来，通盘规划，分工协作，在建设新的工业骨干的同时，让那些工厂在现有基础上一边生产，一边进行必要的扩建，并且请科学机关、设计机关和高等学校在技术上进行帮助，我们就可能用少很多的投资和快几倍的速度达到目的。
    另一方面，从中央提出地方工业大发展以来，北京的工业呈现了一种百花齐放的生动活泼的局面。城乡到处都在建工厂。很多工厂、合作社甚至学校都在日夜不停地试制新产品。广大群众发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，创造了很多优异的成绩，推动着北京工业的大跃进。在这种形势下，怎样才能最有效地发挥各个单位和广大群众的积极性呢？假如我们采取一种听其自由发展的方针，当然工业也会有发展，但是不可避免地会产生一些副作用，如：一些工厂都去做同一种产品，而国家急需的另一些产品又没有人去做；两个工厂合作起来本来可以制造比较高级的产品，但是由于“单干”，就只能分别生产比较低级的产品；一个工厂某些设备和材料在闲置和积压，而另一个工厂却因为缺乏这些东西而停工等等。甚至还可能形成一些盲目发展和自由竞争的现象，从而造成浪费，延缓工业发展的速度，挫伤群众的积极性。因此，我们必须坚决执行“组织起来”的方针，把群众的积极性组织起来，把各方面的力量组织起来，集中领导，全面规划，分工协作，使一切有利于工业发展的力量都充分发挥，使群众的高度积极性和国家的通盘规划紧密结合，使群众的积极性在一个巩固的基础上，得到最充分的持久的发展。汽车拖拉机工业体系的初步形成，也证明了这一点。原来有八个单位都在同时试制汽车、拖拉机，但是其中有一些型号不是当前最需要的，有一些型号又十分相似，而且由于设备和技术力量不足，每个工厂本身都很难迅速大量生产；在组织协作以后，简化了型号，互相分工，互相支援，就能够在短期内转入成批生产。
    按照“组织起来”的方针进行工业改组，还有更深刻的政治经济意义。在实质上，工业改组是在生产关系方面的社会主义革命的继续。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中指出，我国“社会主义生产关系已经建立起来，它是和生产力的发展相适应的；但是，它又还很不完善，这些不完善的方面和生产力的发展又是相矛盾的”。这种分析，同北京工业中的情况也完全相符。在所有制方面，按1957年的产值计算，有60％属于国营和地方国营，23％属于公私合营，17％属于手工业合作社。在实质上这些虽然都是社会主义经济，但是由于所有制不同，中间就有个界限，而没有实行全面的直接的计划和规划，这就在某种程度上束缚了生产力的发展。在另一方面，即在各经济部门中的生产和交换的相互关系方面，也“还在按照社会主义的原则逐步建立，逐步找寻比较适当的形式”。比如就北京的各个国营企业之间的分工协作关系来说，几年来虽然有所发展，但还是很不完善，还没有达到高度组织起来的程度。目前正在进行的工业改组，正是要继续解决这些方面的问题。它包括三个主要内容：一、对一些公私合营企业和手工业合作社继续进行社会主义改造。比如，几个月来，北京已经有一百零八个手工业合作社升级为合作工厂，共有职工一万六千人，年产值占全部手工业产值的三分之一，转厂以后，股金发还，劳动分红改成工资制。二、把一些小企业变成现代化大工业的组成部分。三、在各个同类工厂中进行分工，把一些分散的企业组成合理分工和紧密协作的工业体系。因此，工业改组也是继续完成经济战线上的社会主义革命的一个组成部分。进行了这样的改组，就将使工业中的社会主义生产关系更加巩固，更加完善，社会生产力必然要得到进一步的解放，社会主义制度的优越性也将得到更进一步的发挥。
    同一切生产关系的革命一样，工业改组也会反映到人们的思想领域上，带来思想战线上的斗争。不过，今天在我们这里，在工业中占统治地位的是生产资料的公有制，因此，资本主义残余的生产关系和社会主义生产关系的斗争，主要的将反映成一场思想上的斗争：斗争的一方是共产主义协作思想；斗争的另一方是形形色色的本位主义、宗派主义思想。我们可以看到，绝大多数企业领导干部和广大职工具有高度的共产主义协作精神。这是符合社会主义生产的利益的。社会主义社会最根本的特征之一，就是高度的协作关系。它跟资本主义协作不同。资本主义也有协作，但它是建筑在利润关系上的协作，那是一种互相利用、尔虞我诈的关系，它的基础是生产资料私有制，起主导作用的是自由竞争、互相吞并和无政府状态，归根结底是资本家对劳动人民的剥削和压迫，其结果必然是生产能力的巨大浪费和生产发展的停滞。而在社会主义社会里，生产资料是公有的，人们的根本利益是一致的，因而有着真正的高度协作的基础，人人同心协力，推动着生产一日千里地发展。北京工业改组的顺利进行，广大职工欢欣鼓舞地支持这个改组，互相紧密地配合和支援，甚至不惜牺牲局部利益来成全大局，就是一个生动的证明。
    但是我们也看到，在社会主义社会最初的阶段里，正如列宁所说的，还存在很多资本主义社会的“碎片”。在一些人们身上存在的本位主义、宗派主义的思想，就是这些“碎片”的一部分。他们在工业改组过程中的表现，就是对协作不积极，不愿意在“集中领导、全面规划、分工协作”的原则下来发展工业。有些人想做现代工业中的“单干户”。虽然在农业中单干户已经为数极少甚至没有了，但是工业中还有人对“单干”有兴趣。他们总不愿和人协作，嫌协作麻烦，嫌协作不够“气派”，想把自己搞成一个全能厂，要万事不求人，要“自成体系”。这种“各自为政”，除了浪费资金、设备、人力，延缓建设进度，造成人为的不平衡以外，还有什么好处呢？还有的人在协作中只愿意当主角，不愿意当配角。就是说，不愿意搞零碎产品，愿意搞重要的产值大的，不愿意搞产值小的等等，当然，人人都想在工业建设中发挥更大的作用，做出更大的贡献，这种想法是自然的，也是正确的；但是，只能当主角、不能当配角的想法是不符合逻辑的。其实，当主角和当配角是相对的。在局部范围里当主角的，在全面范围里都是配角；而在全面范围里当配角的，在局部范围里就是主角。在整个工业体系中，既需要主角，也离不开配角，就跟机器离不开螺丝钉一样。至于谁唱主角，谁唱配角，就需要根据具体条件来确定。局部要服从全局。任何人都应当照顾大局。
    上面所说的种种错误思想在今天并不占统治地位，但是有碍于顺利地组织社会主义协作，有碍于工业的迅速改组，因而也就有碍于工业的进一步的发展。因此，我们要用共产主义协作精神当统帅，扫除种种不利于协作的思想。
