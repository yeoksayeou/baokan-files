Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 20th: Since the rectification campaign, a new atmosphere has emerged in Urumqi's literary and art circles, closely integrating with the current political struggles and better serving the people.

　　In various bustling public places in the city, one can now see street poems, cartoons, and songs posted in Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and other languages everywhere. The Autonomous Region's National Song and Dance Troupe uses its evening rest time to create and rehearse seventeen song and dance, street drama, and ballad programs, performing on the streets every afternoon. Among them, the street drama "Building Socialism," which praises the achievements of the motherland's construction in various fields, the street drama "Learning Culture," which promotes the elimination of illiteracy, and the song and dance "Girls of the Collective Farm," which depicts the cotton production of farmers in the autonomous region, are all warmly welcomed by the audience. The song and dance "China-England Race," created by the Cultural Troupe of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, vividly reflects the speed of China's industrial development.

　　It has become a trend for theatrical troupes to leave the theater and go to rural areas and mining areas to participate in labor and tour at the same time. So far, eight of the twelve literary and art groups in Urumqi have gone to rural or mining areas. During Urumqi's concentrated sparrow eradication campaign, literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in the city braved the rain for two consecutive days. During the construction of the Urumqi Youth Canal, many leading actors from theatrical troupes and song and dance troupes took the lead in participating in voluntary labor.

    服务政治　面向群众
    乌鲁木齐文艺界气象一新
    新华社乌鲁木齐20日电　整风以来，乌鲁木齐市文艺界出现了紧密结合当前政治斗争和更好地为人民群众服务的新气象。
    在市内各个热闹的公共场所，目前到处都可以看到张贴着的汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古等文字的街头诗、漫画和歌曲。自治区民族歌舞剧团利用晚上休息时间，创作和排练出十七个歌舞、街头剧和说唱节目，每天下午到街头演出。其中歌颂祖国各方面建设成就的“建设社会主义”，宣传扫除文盲的“学文化”等街头剧，和表现自治区农民生产棉花情况的歌舞“集体农庄的姑娘”，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。新疆军区生产建设兵团文工团创作的歌舞“中、英赛跑”，生动地反映了我国工业发展的速度。
    剧团走出剧场，到农村和工矿区一边参加劳动一边巡回演出，已经形成一种风气。到目前止，乌鲁木齐的十二个文艺团体已有八个下到农村或矿区。乌鲁木齐市突击消灭麻雀时，全市的各族文艺工作者还冒雨连续出击两天。在修筑乌鲁木齐青年渠的时候，很多剧团和歌舞团的主要演员，都首先带头参加义务劳动。
