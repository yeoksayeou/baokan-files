U.S. Aggressor Troops Must Withdraw from South Korea

June 25th is a day that the Korean and Chinese people find hard to forget. On this day eight years ago, the U.S. imperialists launched the bloody Korean War of aggression. The flames of war quickly spread to the border of Northeast China, seriously threatening our country's security. U.S. imperialism妄想 tried to use force to strangle the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and then directed its aggression towards New China, opening a gap in the East of the socialist camp. However, the aggressors completely miscalculated. The Korean people, rising up to defend their homeland, with the support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, after three years of heroic struggle, finally drove the U.S. aggressor troops back to the place where they launched the aggression—the 38th parallel, and forced the United States to accept the armistice. This was the biggest military defeat of U.S. imperialism in its history.

The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people in the anti-aggression war punctured the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism in front of the people of the world, making people realize that U.S. imperialism is not terrible and can be defeated completely, and that people who fight for their independence, freedom, and national sovereignty are invincible. The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people in the anti-aggression war also proved a truth to the people of the world: in the face of any aggression by imperialism, a weak and timid attitude must not be adopted, but a resolute and courageous blow must be given. If you are weak and timid, the imperialist aggressors will take an inch and want a mile; if you resolutely strike hard, the imperialist aggressors will be forced to stop. The victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese people in the anti-aggression war not only disrupted the U.S. plan for world hegemony but also greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of the world, especially the anti-aggression and anti-colonialist people of Asia and Africa.

However, the U.S. imperialist forces are not reconciled to their failure in Korea and Asia. At the Geneva Conference, the United States stubbornly rejected all the proposals for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue put forward by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, bringing the negotiations on the Korean issue to a standstill, and continued to strengthen its colonial rule in South Korea. The U.S. policy of dividing Korea and obstructing and undermining the peaceful reunification of Korea is part of its overall conspiracy to create and maintain tension in Asia. Therefore, although the Korean armistice has been in place for five years, the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea remains unresolved, and the Korean people continue to suffer the pain of national division. Thirty million Korean people have become increasingly intolerant of the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism.

In order to break the deadlock on the Korean issue, after several years of efforts by the Korean and Chinese people, on February 5 this year, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward various proposals for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese government immediately issued a statement on February 7 supporting these timely and realistic proposals of the Korean government. After consultations between the Chinese and Korean governments, a joint statement on February 19 announced the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958. This proactive measure taken by the Chinese and Korean sides not only opened up a new and realistic way for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue but also greatly helped to ease the tension in the Far East and the world. This is a major contribution to the entire cause of peace.

The withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has become one of the central events attracting world attention and has won warm support and praise from many countries and peoples. The Chinese People's Volunteers have already withdrawn the first batch of troops from Korea before April 30 this year, a total of six divisions of 80,000 people. Now the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers has issued a second communique on the withdrawal of troops, deciding to withdraw another six divisions and other special forces, a total of 100,000 people, from Korea from July 11 to August 20. Peace-loving countries and people all over the world have once again seen the sincere desire for peace of the Chinese and Korean governments and peoples. Now they want to ask: When do the United States and the governments of other countries that invaded Korea intend to withdraw their troops from South Korea? The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is the primary prerequisite for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. While the Chinese People's Volunteers are withdrawing from Korea batch after batch, the United States absolutely cannot escape its obligations to the people of the world.

After the Chinese People's Volunteers began to withdraw from Korea, the United States continued to act perversely and stubbornly refused to withdraw its troops from South Korea. This has made the people of the world see who is committed to peace and who is continuing to create tension. The United States refuses to withdraw its troops from South Korea, openly transporting atomic weapons into South Korea, and continues to flaunt its "policy of strength." However, this cannot scare anyone at all. The U.S. "policy of strength" had already gone bankrupt in front of the Korean and Chinese people. Since the Korean and Chinese people were able to defeat the U.S. aggressors a few years ago, then when the strength of the Korean and Chinese people is even stronger and the international situation is more favorable to the peace camp, if the United States dares to re-launch aggression, it will definitely fail even more miserably. The United States' attempt to rely on bayonets to maintain its colonial rule in South Korea for a long time is also impossible. The desire of the South Korean people to peacefully reunify their motherland is as strong as that of the people in the North, and the bloody rule of the U.S. colonialists will increasingly arouse the resistance of the South Korean people. Now, colonialists cannot find any "paradise" in the world, but can only sit on a powder keg. The United States' insistence on maintaining its colonial rule in South Korea and its refusal to withdraw its troops from South Korea can only prove to the people of the world that it is the most reactionary aggressive force in the world.

The Korean and Chinese people have joined hands and made significant contributions to the common cause of stopping U.S. imperialism's aggression and maintaining peace. In the struggle against the aggressors, the Chinese people and the Korean people are comrades-in-arms who fought side by side. In socialist construction, the Chinese people and the Korean people are brothers who support each other. No force can prevent our common socialist cause and peace cause from forging ahead against the wind and waves. No force can destroy the great and immortal friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese and Korean people will use all their strength to continue to consolidate and develop our great friendship. The united strength of the Chinese and Korean people was, is, and will continue to be a reliable guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East.

### 美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜撤退

    美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜撤退
    6月25日这个日子，朝鲜人民和中国人民是难于忘记的。八年前的今天，美帝国主义者发动了血腥的侵略朝鲜战争。战火很快就蔓延到中国东北边界，严重地威胁了我国安全。美帝国主义妄想用武力扼杀年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，进而把侵略矛头指向新中国，在社会主义阵营的东方打开一个缺口。但是，侵略者完全失算了。奋起捍卫祖国的朝鲜人民，在中国人民志愿军的支援之下，经过三年的英勇战斗，终于把美国侵略军打退到它发动侵略的原地——三八线，并且迫使美国接受了停战。这是美帝国主义有史以来的最大的一次军事失败。
    朝中人民反侵略战争的伟大胜利，在全世界人民面前戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎，使人们认识到：美帝国主义并不可怕，是完全可以打败的，而为自己的独立、自由和民族主权而斗争的人民则是不可战胜的。朝中人民反侵略战争的伟大胜利，也在全世界人民面前证明了一条真理：对待帝国主义的任何侵略，决不能采取软弱畏缩的态度，而必须坚决地、勇敢地给以打击。如果软弱畏缩，帝国主义侵略者就会得寸进尺；如果坚决予以痛击，帝国主义侵略者就会被迫住手。朝中人民在反侵略战争中所取得的胜利，不仅打乱了美国称霸世界的侵略计划，而且大大地鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民尤其是反侵略反殖民主义的亚非各国人民。
    但是，美帝国主义侵略势力并不甘心于它在朝鲜和亚洲的失败。在日内瓦会议上，美国顽固地拒绝了朝鲜、中国和苏联等国提出的一切和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，使朝鲜问题的谈判陷于僵局，并不断加强它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。美国所执行的分裂朝鲜，阻挠和破坏朝鲜和平统一的政策，是它力图制造和保持亚洲紧张局势的整个阴谋中的一部分。因此，朝鲜停战实现虽然已经五年了，但是朝鲜和平统一问题仍然不能解决，朝鲜人民仍然遭受祖国分裂的痛苦。三千万朝鲜人民已经越来越不能容忍美国帝国主义的侵略政策。
    为了打开朝鲜问题的僵局，在朝中人民几年来作了许多努力之后，今年2月5日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府又提出了从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的各项建议。中国政府立即在2月7日发表声明，支持朝鲜政府的这些适时的和现实的建议。朝中两国政府经过磋商以后，又在2月19日的联合声明中宣布了中国人民志愿军决定于1958年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜的决定。朝中方面所采取的这一主动措施，不仅为朝鲜问题的和平解决开辟了新的现实的途径，而且大大有利于缓和远东和世界的紧张局势。这是对整个和平事业的重大贡献。
    中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退，成为世界注目的中心事件之一，博得了许多国家和人民的热烈支持和赞扬。中国人民志愿军已经在今年4月30日以前从朝鲜撤出第一批部队，共六个师八万人。现在中国人民志愿军总部又发表第二批撤军的公报，决定从7月11日开始到8月20日以前再从朝鲜撤出六个师及其他特种兵部队共十万人。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民又一次看到了中朝两国政府和人民对于和平的真诚愿望。现在他们要问：美国和侵朝的其他各国政府究竟打算什么时候从南朝鲜撤出他们的军队？一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，是和平解决朝鲜问题的首要前提条件。当中国人民志愿军一批又一批地撤出朝鲜的时候，美国绝对逃避不了它在世界人民众目睽睽之下所应负的义务。
    美国在中国人民志愿军开始从朝鲜撤退以后，仍然倒行逆施，顽固地拒绝从南朝鲜撤退它的军队。这就使全世界的人民看到，究竟谁在致力于和平，谁在继续制造紧张局势。美国拒绝从南朝鲜撤退它的军队，并且把原子武器公然运进南朝鲜，继续炫耀它的“实力政策”。但是，这是丝毫也吓唬不了人的。美国的“实力政策”早在朝中人民面前破产了。朝中人民既然能在几年以前打败美国侵略者，那么，当中朝人民力量更加强大、国际形势更加有利于和平阵营的时候，美国胆敢重新发动侵略，那就一定要失败得更惨。美国企图依靠刺刀长期维持在南朝鲜的殖民统治，也是不可能的。南朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望，同朝鲜北部人民一样强烈，而且美国殖民者的血腥统治，也将日益激起南朝鲜人民的反抗。现在，殖民者在世界上不可能找到什么“安乐乡”，而只能坐在火药桶上。美国坚持在南朝鲜维持它的殖民统治，拒绝从南朝鲜撤退军队，只能在全世界人民面前证明它是全世界最反动的侵略势力。
    朝中人民在制止美帝国主义的侵略和维护和平的共同事业中携手合作，共同作出了重大的贡献。在反抗侵略者的斗争中，中国人民同朝鲜人民是并肩作战的战友。在社会主义建设中，中国人民同朝鲜人民是互相支援的兄弟。没有任何力量能够阻挠我们共同的社会主义事业和和平事业乘风破浪地向前发展。没有任何力量能够破坏我们两国人民伟大的和不朽的友谊。中朝两国人民将用一切力量继续巩固和发展我们的伟大友谊。中朝两国人民的团结力量，过去是，现在是，将来仍然是维护远东和平的可靠保证。
