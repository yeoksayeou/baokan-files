　　Notes
	Golf Course Hero
	British Prime Minister Macmillan went to the United States on the 6th. According to British newspapers, Macmillan took a vacation in Scotland before his trip and used the opportunity to practice golf, because when he met with Eisenhower in the United States, he planned to take time to compete with this golfing buddy.
	Why does the British Prime Minister have such leisure and elegance when his official duties are so busy? It turns out that, according to British golf experts, Macmillan's golf skills are much better than Eisenhower's and he can be sure of victory. British cartoonists went on to explain: "In a game of golf, Macmillan will win back some of the glory lost by the British Empire."
	This statement by the British cartoonist profoundly depicts the current situation of the British Empire. Indeed, Macmillan has had many painful experiences in dealing with his American "allies." In Macmillan's view, losing at the negotiating table, but winning on the golf course, may save a little face! However, it is also pathetic that the Prime Minister of the dignified British Empire can only be a hero on the golf course.
	The Arsonist and Fire
	With the support of the armed coup by the French extremist colonial forces in Algeria, De Gaulle took over the French regime. However, only a few days after De Gaulle came to power, the French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" reported that he and the extremist colonial forces had begun a "battle of strength."
	What is the reason that suddenly turned De Gaulle against the extremist colonial forces? According to "Le Monde," the extremist colonial forces are trying their best to intervene in France itself, and even to put pressure on Paris (i.e., the De Gaulle regime), but De Gaulle is unwilling to accept this "pressure" and said to these people: "Don't continue the revolution."
	Describing the crazy actions of extremist colonialism as "revolution" is De Gaulle's true color. However, this "revolution" has now become a threat to De Gaulle. The arsonist is afraid of being burned by fire, which is why De Gaulle is engaged in a "battle of strength" with the extremist colonial forces that supported him to power.
	The French people are stepping up their unity to defend democracy and freedom, but on the other hand, the French reactionary forces are engaged in open and secret struggles, which foreshadows that the future of the reactionary forces is far from very bright.

　　札记
    球场英雄
    英国首相麦克米伦已于6日赴美国。据英国报纸报道，麦克米伦行前曾经在苏格兰休假，并利用这个机会大练高尔夫球，因为他到美国同艾森豪威尔会谈时，准备抽空同这位球友较量一番。
    这位英国首相在公务这么繁忙之际，为什么还有如此闲情逸致呢？原来，据英国的高尔夫球专家说，麦克米伦的球艺要比艾森豪威尔高明得多，可以稳操胜算。英国的漫画家接着解释说：“在一场高尔夫球赛中，麦克米伦将替大英帝国赢得一些失去了的光荣。”
    英国漫画家这段话，可谓深刻地描绘了今日大英帝国的处境。的确，在同美国“盟友”打交道中，麦克米伦是不乏惨痛的经验的。在麦克米伦看来，谈判桌上吃了败仗，球场上打个胜仗，也许可以挽留一点面子吧！但是，作为堂堂大英帝国的首相，仅仅在球场上才显英雄，也是足堪悲叹的了。
    玩火者与火
    依靠阿尔及利亚的法国极端殖民主义势力的武装政变的支持，戴高乐接管了法国的政权。但是，戴高乐上台才刚刚几天，法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”就报道说，他同极端殖民主义势力之间已开始进行一场“实力的较量”。
    究竟是什么原因忽然使戴高乐同极端殖民主义势力反目相向呢？据“世界报”的报道说，极端殖民主义势力竭力想要插足法国本土、甚至要对巴黎（即戴高乐政权）施加压力，而戴高乐却不愿意接受这种“压力”，并且对这些人说：“你们不要继续进行革命”。
    把极端殖民主义的疯狂行动说成是“革命”，这倒是戴高乐的本色。可是，这种“革命”现在却成为对戴高乐的威胁了。玩火者怕受到火烫，这正是戴高乐所以同支持他上台的极端殖民主义势力进行“实力较量”的原因。
    法国人民正在加紧团结来保卫民主和自由，然而另一方面法国的反动势力却发生了明争暗斗，这预示着反动势力的前途远不是十分美好的。
