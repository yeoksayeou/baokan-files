    Draw More Illustrations for Literary Works

    Recently published outstanding novels, such as "Red Flag Banner," "Red Sun," "Song of Youth," "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," and "Bitter Vegetable Flowers," are all good books that inspire us to move forward. However, among these books, only Feng Deying's "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" has a few relatively good illustrations, which make the images of the original work more specific, vivid, and distinct, helping readers to visualize the characters' personalities and appearances. This is a cause for celebration! The remaining works lack illustrations, which makes one feel it is somewhat incomplete.

    Dear artists, please draw more exquisite illustrations for these literary works that depict new heroic figures, so that these works, which are loved by the broad masses of readers, can become richer and more colorful, and exert greater artistic power!

    给文学作品多画些插图
    最近出版的一批优秀的长篇小说，如“红旗谱”、“红日”、“青春之歌”、“林海雪原”、“苦菜花”等，都是鼓舞我们前进的好书。但是在这些书中，只有冯德英的“苦菜花”附有几幅比较好的插图，它使原作的形象更加具体、生动、鲜明，帮助了读者形象地看到书中人物的性格和外貌。这是值得高兴的事！而其余几部作品却都没有插图，使人有美中不足之感。
    亲爱的画家们，请给我们这些描写新英雄人物的文学作品多画些精美插图，让这些为广大读者所热爱的作品变得更加丰富多采，发挥更大的艺术力量吧！
