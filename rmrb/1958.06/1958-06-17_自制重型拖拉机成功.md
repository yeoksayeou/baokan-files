Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th. China's first heavy-duty tractor - the "Red Flag" 80 heavy-duty crawler tractor, was recently born in the Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory in Anshan.

The "Red Flag" 80 heavy-duty crawler tractor has an engine power of 80 horsepower and a traction force of 9,000 kilograms. It can be widely used in industry and agriculture. In agriculture, it can drive two five-bottom plows to reclaim twelve mu of wasteland per hour, or pull seven twenty-four-row seeders to sow one hundred and fifty mu per hour. It can also harvest, ridge, and ditch. In the forest, it can transport timber and pull up tree roots. In the construction industry, it can bulldoze and open roads, compact roadbeds, and lay railway tracks. The tractor weighs more than eleven tons, but it is easy to operate. Because it uses tracks, the pressure on the ground is lighter than that of a horse, and it can travel on rugged mountain slopes, fields, and swamps.

This tractor has more than 12,000 parts and requires more than 40 kinds of steel. Many parts, such as gears and spline shafts, need to be processed with special machine tools. However, the workers improved slotting machines to replace gear slotters, planers to replace hobbing machines, and used domestically produced alloy steel to replace imported steel. Mechanical factories in Tianjin, Harbin, and Changchun, as well as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other units, also assisted them in processing various precision parts, and finally made the trial production of this tractor a success ahead of schedule.

    自制重型拖拉机成功
    据新华社鞍山16日电　我国第一台重型拖拉机——“红旗”八十号重型履带拖拉机，最近在鞍山市灵山农业机械厂诞生。
    “红旗”八十号重型履带拖拉机发动机的功率是八十马力，牵引力达九千公斤，能在工业和农业中广泛运用。在农业上，它能带动两台五铧犁每小时开垦荒地十二亩，或者牵引七台二十四行播种机每小时播种一百五十亩，还能收割和开垅挖沟；在森林中，它可以运输木材、拔树根；在建筑工业上，它能推土开路，镇压路基，铺设铁轨。拖拉机自重十一吨多，但操纵轻便，由于用履带行走，对地面的压力比马踩的还轻，而且能在崎岖不平的山坡、原野和沼泽地带行走。
    这种拖拉机共有一万二千多个部件，需要四十多种不同钢种的钢材，有很多齿轮、花键轴等部件都要用特殊的机床加工。但是职工们改进插床代替了插齿机，用刨床代替了滚齿机，用国产的合金钢代替了进口的钢材。天津、哈尔滨、长春的机械工厂和鞍山钢铁公司等单位也协助他们加工各种精密的部件，终于使这台拖拉机提前试制成功了。
