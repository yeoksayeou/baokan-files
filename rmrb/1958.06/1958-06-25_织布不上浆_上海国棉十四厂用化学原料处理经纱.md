    Weaving Without Sizing
    Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 14 Uses Chemical Raw Materials to Treat Warp Yarn
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 14 has successfully tested a method of treating warp yarn with chemical raw materials, which can fundamentally eliminate the sizing process that has been used in cotton textile factories for decades. This is a major technological innovation in the cotton textile industry.
    In the past, cotton yarn had to be sized before weaving. The main raw material for making sizing was starch from flour. After the cotton yarn was sized, its strength could be increased, it was not easy to break during weaving, and the woven cloth was smooth and crisp. These sizes would be removed with water once they were soaked, which was of no benefit to the quality of the cotton cloth. Printing and dyeing factories had to degum with steam and caustic soda before printing and dyeing the cloth. Each year, large cotton textile factories in Shanghai alone consumed more than 30 million catties of flour. After liberation, in order to save grain, factories tried every means to reduce sizing, and used cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, bletilla striata, lycoris radiata powder and other miscellaneous grains and other non-edible starches as substitutes, but they still had to consume more than 14 million catties of flour each year.
    The method successfully tested by Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 14 completely eliminates the use of starch for sizing. It only requires the cotton yarn to be treated with a 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (referred to as C·M·C·) solution before weaving, and the cotton yarn becomes smooth and wear-resistant, and will not break during weaving. The first batch of woven cloth has been tested by instruments and printing and dyeing processing, proving that it is completely qualified and the quality is not affected at all.
    Using this method can not only save a huge amount of flour, but also save the coal, electricity and chemical raw materials used throughout the sizing process, and simplify the production process. Cotton yarn treated with C·M·C· is not affected by the temperature and humidity of the workshop during weaving. Therefore, female workers can carry out production in natural air conditions, greatly improving labor conditions. C·M·C· is easy to dissolve in water, so there is no need to degum with steam and caustic soda during printing and dyeing.

### 织布不上浆  上海国棉十四厂用化学原料处理经纱

    织布不上浆
    上海国棉十四厂用化学原料处理经纱
    据新华社上海24日电　上海国棉十四厂试验成功了一种用化学原料处理经纱的方法，可以根本废除棉纺织厂几十年来沿用的浆纱工序。这是棉纺织工业中的一项重大的技术革新。
    过去，棉纱在织布之前都要经过上浆。制作浆料的主要原料是面粉中的淀粉。棉纱经过上浆以后可以增加强力，织造的时候不易断头，织出的布光滑挺括。这些浆料一经下水就随水脱去，对棉布质量并无好处，印染厂在印染布匹前，必须用蒸汽和烧碱退浆。每年单是上海大型棉纺织厂消耗的面粉就有三千多万斤。解放以后，各厂为了节约粮食，曾经千方百计减少上浆，曾经采用木薯、玉蜀黍、山芋、白芨、石蒜粉等杂粮和其他非食用的淀粉做代用品，但每年仍然要消耗一千四百多万斤面粉。
    上海国棉十四厂试验成功的这个办法，完全不用淀粉上浆，只须把棉纱在织造以前经过1％的羧基甲基纤维素（简称C·M·C·）溶液浸润处理，棉纱就变得光滑耐磨，用来织布不会断头。第一批织出的布已经经过仪器检验和印染加工，证明完全合格，质量丝毫不受影响。
    采用这个办法，不仅可以节约巨大数量的面粉，还可以节约整个浆纱过程中所使用的煤、电和化工原料，简化了生产过程。用C·M·C·处理过的棉纱，在织造的时候不受车间温湿度的影响，因此，女工可以在自然空气条件下进行生产，大大改善了劳动条件。C·M·C·易于溶解水中，因此印染的时候，不须再用蒸汽和烧碱退浆。
