    Jiao Zhen'an Develops High-Voltage Flaw Detector
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 15th: A high-voltage flaw detector for inspecting industrial enamel products has recently been developed by Jiao Zhen'an, a young electrician at the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. To check product quality with this instrument, one only needs to run an electrified copper brush over the enamel surface, and sparks will appear wherever there are defects.
    The industrial enamel produced by the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory this year is a rigorously tested acid-resistant product. Currently, most enamel factories use magnifying glasses to inspect quality, which is inefficient and cannot guarantee absolute reliability. Di Linjie, the Party Committee Secretary of the Enamel Factory, saw an electrified instrument being used to inspect pharmaceutical utensils during a visit to a pharmaceutical factory, and he thought about manufacturing a similar instrument to inspect industrial enamel products. After returning to the factory, he raised this idea, and Jiao Zhen'an succeeded in testing it in a very short time.

    焦振安制成高压探伤仪
    据新华社西安15日电　一种检验工业搪瓷品的高压探伤仪，最近由西安人民搪瓷厂青年电工焦振安制成。用这种仪器检查产品质量，只要把一只通电的铜刷在瓷面绕一下，有疵点地方就冒出火花。
    西安人民搪瓷厂今年开始生产的工业搪瓷，是一种要求严格的耐酸产品，目前一般搪瓷厂都用放大镜检查质量，效率低，也不能保证绝对可靠。搪瓷厂党委书记邸林杰参观制药厂时，看到用一种通电的仪器检查制药器皿，便想到制造类似的仪器检查工业搪瓷品。他回厂以后把这个想法提了出来，焦振安用很短的时间便试成了。
