    Among Gamblers

    Macmillan, in a speech to Johns Hopkins University in the United States on June 10, said: "The capitalist system is rather like a gamble. If one gambler gets all the money, the gamble is over."

    Why did the British Prime Minister, who has always been careful to conceal the ugliness of the capitalist system, actually compare the capitalist system to gambling this time? It turns out that this passage was not actually addressed to the students of Johns Hopkins University, but to Eisenhower. One of the main purposes of his visit to the United States to meet with Eisenhower was to obtain a loan from the United States to stabilize the position of the pound sterling. It seems that the United States is not interested in his request. Therefore, Macmillan took the opportunity to elaborate in a speech to the university students, and simply opened the skylight to speak frankly, making Eisenhower aware of the stakes. He immediately followed this passage by pointing this out. He said: "Even from a narrow, selfish point of view, creditor nations cannot stop the circulation of money."

    It is highly doubtful whether Macmillan's remarks will help him achieve his request. Because, to use his analogy, the relationship between capitalist countries is nothing more than a gambler's relationship, and every gambler wants to cheat his opponent out of everything and make a fortune for himself. Is it conceivable that the United States would violate the gambler's conventions and take money to help Britain for a purpose that only benefits Britain and not itself?

    赌徒之间
    麦克米伦在6月10日向美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学发表的演说里有这样一段话：“资本主义制度颇像一场赌博。如果一个赌徒把所有的钱都弄到手，这场赌博也就结束了。”
    一向小心翼翼地为资本主义制度遮丑的英国首相，为什么这次居然也把资本主义制度比成赌博了呢？原来，他这段话实际上不是说给约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的学生们听的，而是说给艾森豪威尔听的。这次他到美国来和艾森豪威尔会谈，重要目的之一是要从美国搞到一笔贷款以稳定英镑地位。看来，美国对他的要求并不感到兴趣。于是，麦克米伦就在向大学生发表的演说里借题发挥，并且索性打开天窗说亮话，对艾森豪威尔晓以利害。他在这段话以后紧接着就点穿了这一点。他说：“甚至从狭隘的自私观点来看，债权国也不能使货币停止流通。”
    麦克米伦的这番话是否有助于使他的要求如愿以偿，是大可怀疑的。因为，就用他的比喻来说，资本主义国家之间的关系不过是赌徒的关系，而每一个赌徒都是想把对手骗得精光而使自己大发其财的。难道可以设想，美国会违反赌徒常规，为了仅仅有利于英国而并不有利于自己的目的而拿钱来帮助英国吗？
