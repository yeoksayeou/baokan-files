Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th (Xinhua reporter Wang Yuzhang) Reports that people in northern Korea have enthusiastically launched a signature campaign on the letter of gratitude from the Korean people to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people.

Today in Pyongyang, workers from factories such as the Hwanghae Iron Works, the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory, and officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the Korean People's Army stationed in Pyongyang signed the letter of gratitude.

More than 800 workers from the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory held a gathering this afternoon before signing their names. Shin Bo-hyun, the Korean Workers' Party Committee Chairman of the factory, read the letter of gratitude amidst warm applause. Then, workers who had just finished their shifts and were still wearing their work clothes signed the letter of gratitude in the club and courtyard where the gathering was held. Workers who were still working signed their names next to the machines. Factory director Yuan Jintai signed the letter of gratitude first and then told reporters that every Korean person should write their name on this letter of gratitude, which will further deepen the friendship between the people of Korea and China. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people aided us in our most difficult times. For many years, we have overcome difficulties together and celebrated victories together. We feel immensely happy to have China as such a fraternal country.

Zhao Junlong, a model worker who had already completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule on June 7th, told reporters after signing his name that when American planes bombed Pyongyang during the war, one of my arms was injured. The Volunteers rescued me and treated my injuries for two months. I will use the arm that the Volunteers healed for me to work hard, complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Zhao Yuanfeng, an assembly worker who had interned at the China Shanghai Huasheng Machinery Factory for a year, said that when I signed my name, I thought of the help that Chinese workers gave me when I was in China. I learned how to make knitting machines for socks in China, and I will never forget the friendship of the Chinese people.

Republic Hero Woo Jong-chil, from a certain unit of the Korean People's Army stationed in Pyongyang, told reporters after signing his name that for more than seven years, we fought alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers. Today, we are saying goodbye to our comrades as if we were separating from our own brothers. We must work doubly hard for the peaceful reunification of the motherland to repay our comrades.

Kim Un-ryong, a third-class soldier of the People's Army who had fought alongside the Volunteers on the Five Holy Mountains front, said that during the war, the Volunteers fought with us against a common enemy. After the war, the Volunteers built schools for Korean children and helped farmers build reservoirs. Our close comrades, the Chinese People's Volunteers, are about to leave Korea, but their meritorious service on this land will last forever. Now, there is no reason for the U.S. military to remain in South Korea any longer and should withdraw immediately. We must drive the U.S. military out of our country.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th "Labor News" today published an editorial entitled "Korean-Chinese Friendship Will Last Forever," stating that the letter of gratitude from the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea's Third Session, on behalf of all the Korean people, to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the great Chinese people, is another glorious document worthy of pride in the immortal friendly relations between the peoples of Korea and China. The editorial said that the Korean people warmly welcome this letter, which is filled with the Korean people's heartfelt gratitude, fraternal respect, and trust towards the 600 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The editorial said that the friendly relations between the peoples of Korea and China have become a shining example of the fraternal friendly and cooperative relations between the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union under the eternal banner of internationalism.

The editorial said that the Chinese people's dispatch of volunteers to aid the Korean people will forever remain in the memory of the Korean people. The sincere assistance given by the Chinese people to the Korean people during and after the war, together with the great assistance given by the fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union to the Korean people, has become an incomparably great force inspiring the Korean people.

The editorial said that the Chinese People's Volunteers, after completing their noble mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, voluntarily withdrew from Korea in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. Although they will all leave Korea, the unbreakable friendship formed between the peoples of Korea and China in the struggle against a common enemy will be further consolidated and developed in the common cause of the victory of socialism and peace in the Far East.

    曾经在中国上海华盛机械制造厂实习了一年的装配工赵元奉说，在我签名的时候，我就想起了在中国时中国工人对我的帮助。我在中国学会了制造织袜子的针织机，我永远忘不了中国人民的情谊。
    驻平壤的朝鲜人民军某部共和国英雄禹锺七在签名后对记者说，七年多来，我们同中国人民志愿军一同战斗。今天我们像同亲兄弟分别一样同我们的战友告别。我们一定要为和平统一祖国加倍地努力，以此来回答我们的战友。

    社论说，中国人民志愿军在完成了抗美援朝的崇高使命以后，为了促进朝鲜的和平统一，主动撤出朝鲜。虽然他们将全部离开朝鲜，但是朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人斗争中结成的牢不可破的友谊，将在为社会主义的胜利和远东和平的共同事业中得到进一步的巩固和发展。
