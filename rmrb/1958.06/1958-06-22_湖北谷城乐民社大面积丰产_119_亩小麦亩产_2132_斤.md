Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st. The fourth production team of Leminshe in Shenwan Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, achieved a high-yield record on a large area of 119.8 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 2132 jin and 10 liang per mu, an increase of 1.63 times compared to the average yield of 810 jin per mu last year. Those who inspected this land included the inspection team of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee and Gucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as Hao Fengwu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Gucheng County Committee, and Qiu Hongxuan, Secretary of the Township Branch. After several days of actual investigation and repeated calculations, they finally proved that the bumper harvest record was completely true.

Last winter, when this team sowed, they plowed and harrowed five times horizontally and vertically, all implemented small kang ridge mulching, deep plowing reached seven inches, and all implemented wide and narrow row strip sowing with a sowing width of four inches and a blank row of two inches, with an average of 27 jin of seeds sown per mu, and 300 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu. After the wheat emerged, topdressing was applied four times in winter and spring, with each application of natural fertilizer reaching 100 dan per mu, in addition to chemical fertilizer. Furthermore, insects were controlled twice and weeds were hoed three times, so that by the time of maturity, the ears were large and the grains were full, with an average of more than 500,000 ears per mu and an average of 45 grains per ear. Now the members believe that if the technical committee member Ma Kaijin had not advocated hoeing out some wheat seedlings this spring, the yield might have been even higher.

Now this team is summarizing its experience and has decided to deep plow the land to one chi this year and increase fertilizer application to 1,000 dan, striving to achieve a wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu next year.

    湖北谷城乐民社大面积丰产
    119亩小麦亩产2132斤
    据新华社武汉21日电  湖北谷城县沈湾乡乐民社第四生产队一一九点八亩小麦，经过实打验收，每亩平均产量获得了二千一百三十二斤十两的大面积高产纪录，比去年每亩平均产量八百一十斤增产一点六三倍。验收这块地的人员，有中共襄阳地委、谷城县委验收组和谷城县县委书记处书记郝逢武、乡支部书记丘洪宣等同志。经过他们几天的实查和反复核算，最后证明了丰产纪录完全属实。
    这个队去年冬季播种时，都横直犁耙了五道，全部实行了小炕堡墒，深耕达到了七寸，同时又全部实行了播幅四寸、空行两寸的宽窄行条播，每亩下种平均二十七斤，每亩施底肥三百担。麦子出土后，冬春又追了四次肥，除化肥外，每次每亩自然肥都达一百担，并且治了两次虫，锄了三次草，因此到成熟时，穗大、籽粒饱满，每亩平均有五十万穗以上，每穗平均有四十五粒。现在社员们认为，今春要不是技术委员马开金主张锄掉一些麦苗，产量还可能要高一些。
    现在这个队正在总结经验，决定今年把地深耕到一尺，施肥增加到一千担，争取明年实现小麦三千斤队。
