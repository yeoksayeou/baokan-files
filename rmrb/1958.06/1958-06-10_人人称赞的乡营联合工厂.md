　　The Joint Township Factory Praised by Everyone
    By our reporters Chen Ji and Xu Jiazhu
    The joint factory run by the Daye Township in Jin County, Liaoning Province, has won the praise of farmers. The Jin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently requested that all township-run industries in the county adopt this form of joint factory.
    This joint factory has nine branches: ironwork, woodwork, leather making, wine making, oil pressing, plow making, grain and feed processing, vehicle repair, and cloth dyeing, with a total of seventy employees. The factory equipment includes diesel engines, large stone mills pulled by livestock, and wooden oil presses that require swinging sledgehammers.
    Established only a month ago, this factory has already improved a batch of new-style farm tools for agricultural production cooperatives. The double-wheel double-铧 plow used to require four animals to pull, but after improvement, only two are needed. Large carts, which previously had to be purchased in the county seat, can now also be produced by the joint factory. In the past, farmers had to carry corn to the county seat for processing, but now they only need to send it to the nearby joint factory, and the price is much cheaper.
    By concentrating seven industries together, the joint factory can achieve division of labor and cooperation in equipment, raw materials, and labor. Combining wine making and feed processing allows for the joint utilization of sorghum husks, peanut shells, and sweet potato vines for making wine, and the remaining distiller's grains are excellent pig feed. Currently, members who send one hundred jin of sorghum husks to this factory can get back eighty jin of distiller's grains without spending a penny. Currently, there is a shortage of power machinery in rural areas, and the factory's only two diesel engines can simultaneously drive the grain processing machine, feed grinder, and the fan for the iron smelting furnace. The joint factory can also uniformly adjust labor. Workers who are not engaged in year-round production can return to the agricultural production cooperative to work when there are no raw materials, or they can help with odd jobs in other trades.
    This factory can now make complete large carts and full sets of leather products for livestock. They will also expand their scale and undertake the task of repairing and assembling tractors.
    By concentrating the various branches together, the joint factory facilitates management, enabling township cadres to learn how to run a factory more quickly. The workers in the Daye Township joint factory were originally mostly skilled members of agricultural production cooperatives who had been working separately for many years. The division of labor and cooperation within the joint factory is relatively clear, and the organization and discipline are also stronger, which helps to cultivate the collective spirit of this group of new "farmer-workers" in the countryside.

　　人人称赞的乡营联合工厂
    本报记者　陈迹　徐家柱
    辽宁省锦县大业乡乡营的联合工厂，获得农民的好评。中共锦县委员会最近要求全县的乡营工业，多采取这种联合工厂的形式。
    这个联合工厂有铁工、木工、制革、制酒、制油、制铧、粮谷饲料加工、车辆修理和染布九个分厂，共有职工七十人。工厂设备有柴油机、有牲畜拉动的大石磨、也有需要抡动大锤的木头榨油机。
    这个工厂开办才一个月已为农业生产合作社改进了一批新式农具。双轮双铧犁过去要四头牲口才能拉动，改进后只要两头就够了。过去需要到县城去购买的大车，现在联合工厂也能生产了。农民过去要把苞米挑到县城里去加工，现在只要送到就近的联合工厂，而且价钱便宜得多。
    联合工厂把七个行业集中在一起，能够在设备、原料、劳动力等方面分工协作。制酒和饲料加工联合在一起，就可以共同利用高粱壳、花生壳和地瓜秧造酒，剩下的酒糟又是很好的喂猪饲料。现在，社员们送一百斤高粱壳到这个厂，不花一分钱，就能拿回八十斤酒糟。目前农村缺少动力机械，这个厂仅有的两台柴油机，能够同时带动粮谷加工机、饲料粉碎机和化铁炉子吹风用的风扇。联合工厂还能够统一调剂劳动力。不是常年生产的工人，没有原料时，可以回农业生产合作社劳动，也可以帮助其他工种干杂活。
    这个厂现在能做出整台大车和套牲口的全副皮革制品。他们还将扩大规模，担负起修配拖拉机的任务。
    联合工厂把各个分厂集中在一起，便于管理，使乡干部能较快地学会办厂。大业乡联合工厂的工人，原来绝大部分是农业生产合作社里有手艺的社员，多年来一直分散干活。联合工厂内部分工、协作关系较明显，组织性纪律性也较强，这就有助于在农村里培养这批“亦农亦工”的新工人的集体主义思想。
