Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. The National Exhibition of Achievements in Supporting the Military Dependents and Providing Relief and Social Welfare Production, organized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, opened today.

Lin Boqu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, He Long, Vice Premier, and others attended the opening ceremony.

Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke at the opening ceremony. Xie Juezai said that the exhibition mainly displays the production achievements of the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, other elderly, weak, and disabled people, as well as impoverished people in need of relief from all cities across the country, which are the achievements of social welfare production. He also said that the purpose of the exhibition is to exchange experiences, review achievements, and promote local areas to exert greater efforts, strive for the best, and develop social welfare production in a faster, better, and more economical way. Xiao Hua, in his speech, conveyed the greetings of all comrades in the People's Liberation Army to the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and others who have made outstanding achievements in production, and wished them even greater achievements in production.

The exhibition is located in Beihai Park and is divided into seven parts, providing a comprehensive introduction to the situation of social welfare undertakings in our country. In cities, social welfare production participated in by the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and households with living difficulties has achieved great results. According to statistics at the end of 1957, there were 8,009 social welfare production units nationwide, with more than 580,000 people participating in production. The exhibits show that vigorously developing social welfare production not only satisfies the desire of the dependents of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and other elderly, weak, and disabled people with some labor capacity to participate in socialist construction, but also enables them to move from poverty to prosperity and live a happy life with enough to eat and wear. In rural areas, more than 3.13 million households and more than 5.19 million widowed, orphaned, and childless cooperative members enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment from agricultural cooperatives. Since the high tide of agricultural cooperation, especially since the great leap forward in agricultural production this spring, new developments have taken place in rural social welfare undertakings, namely the emergence of many "Five Guarantees" elderly homes in rural areas. It better guarantees the lives of the "Five Guarantees" households, allowing them to live a happy old age without worries. The exhibition also introduced the welfare undertakings for the blind and deaf-mute, as well as the situation of disabled soldiers' sanatoriums, orphanages, homes for the disabled and elderly, as well as the artificial limb industry and the transformation of vagrants.

The exhibition is scheduled to close on July 25. (Attached picture)

　　社会福利生产事业成绩大检阅
    全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会开幕
    新华社6日讯　内务部举办的全国优抚救济社会福利事业生产展览会今天开幕。
    林伯渠副委员长、贺龙副总理等参加了开幕式。
    内务部部长谢觉哉和中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华在开幕式上讲话。谢觉哉说，这个展览会主要是展出全国各城市烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人和其他老弱残废者，以及需要救济的贫苦人民的生产成绩，也就是社会福利生产事业的成绩。他又说，这次展览会的目的，在于交流经验，检阅成绩，促进各地鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地发展社会福利生产。萧华在讲话中代表解放军全体同志向在生产中创造出优异成绩的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人等致意，并祝他们在生产中获得更大的成就。
    这个展览会设在北海公园，分七个部分，全面地介绍了我国社会福利事业的情况。在城市，有烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人和生活困难户参加的社会福利生产已取得了很大成绩。根据1957年底的统计，全国有社会福利生产单位八千零九个，参加生产的有五十八万多人。展览会的展品表明，大力发展社会福利生产，不仅满足了有部分劳动力的烈属、军属、残废军人和其他老弱残废者参加社会主义建设的愿望，并使他们由贫困走上富裕，过着吃得饱、穿得暖的愉快生活。在农村，有三百一十三万多户、五百一十九万多鳏寡孤独的社员享受着农业社的“五保”待遇。从农业合作化高潮以来，特别是从今春农业生产大跃进以来，农村社会福利事业有了新的发展，即在农村出现了许多“五保”户养老院。它更好地保证了“五保”户的生活，使他们无忧无虑地过着幸福的晚年。展览会还介绍了盲人、聋哑人的福利事业和残废军人教养院、孤儿教养院、残老教养院的情况，以及假肢工业和游民改造的情况。
    展览会预计在7月25日闭幕。（附图片）
