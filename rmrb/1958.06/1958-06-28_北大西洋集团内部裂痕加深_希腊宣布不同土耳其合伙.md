Xinhua News Agency, Athens: Due to the Turkish government inciting Turkish Cypriot rioters to commit atrocities against Greek Cypriot residents, the Greek government has announced its unwillingness to cooperate with Turkey within the framework of NATO any longer.

Greek Foreign Minister Averoff said on the 24th during the Greek Parliament's discussion of the Cyprus issue that Greece is unwilling to continue cooperating with Turkey within the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He requested that NATO consider "reorganizing" the NATO Southeastern European Command located in Izmir, Turkey. Eleven days earlier, the Greek government had already withdrawn all Greek personnel stationed at this command.

On the same day, the Greek government also announced the cancellation of a meeting scheduled to be held in Athens, convened by the NATO Southern European Command, because the delegates attending the meeting included four Turkish officers. A Greek government spokesperson announced that there would be no meetings "attended by both Greeks and Turks."

    北大西洋集团内部裂痕加深
    希腊宣布不同土耳其合伙
    新华社讯　雅典消息：由于土耳其政府煽动塞浦路斯岛土耳其族暴民对希腊族居民进行暴行，希腊政府宣布不愿再在北大西洋集团中同土耳其合作。
    希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫24日在希腊议会开始讨论塞浦路斯问题时说，希腊不愿意在北大西洋公约组织的范围以内继续同土耳其合作了。他要求北大西洋集团考虑“重新改组”设在土耳其的伊兹密尔的北大西洋集团东南欧司令部的问题。十一天以前，希腊政府已经撤回了驻在这个司令部的全部希腊籍工作人员。
    同一天，希腊政府还宣布取消了一次预定在雅典举行的由北大西洋集团南欧司令部召集的会议，因为参加这次会议的代表中有四个土耳其军官。希腊政府发言人宣布，将不会有任何“既有希腊人又有土耳其人参加的”会议。
