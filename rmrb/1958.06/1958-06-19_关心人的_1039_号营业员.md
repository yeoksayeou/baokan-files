    Caring Salesperson No. 1039
    My older brother, who was sent to work and temper himself in the rural areas of Hubei, wrote a letter asking me to send him rain boots. The next day, I sewed the rain boots into a package and took them to the Bamiancao Post Office in this city to mail.

    The comrade on duty at the parcel counter was a woman with a badge numbered 1039 on her chest. She smiled and took the package, placed it on the scale, and told me: "The total weight is one kilogram and eight grams. According to postal regulations, the postage is 60 cents per kilogram. If it exceeds one kilogram but is less than two kilograms, it is calculated as two kilograms." At this time, I hesitated a bit because it seemed not worth it to spend an extra 60 cents for just eight grams over.

    This salesperson guessed what I was thinking, so she asked me what I had used to wrap the rain boots. I replied that I had wrapped them in two layers of paper. She pondered for a moment and said she had a solution. Saying this, she found scissors, needle, and thread, and after asking for my consent, she opened the package, took out the newspaper inside, and then weighed it again. The weight dropped to exactly one kilogram. I smiled, and she smiled too. Finally, she even helped me sew up the package.

    I was very moved by this salesperson's enthusiastic service to the people, and I have not been able to forget this incident for several days.

    关心人的1039号营业员
    下放到湖北农村劳动锻炼的哥哥来信，要我把雨靴捎给他。次日，我就把雨靴缝了个包裹，拿到本市八面槽邮局去投寄。
    在包裹处值班的是一位胸前挂着1039号证章的女同志。她微笑地接过包裹放在天秤上一秤告诉我说：全重一公斤零八公分，根据邮章规定：每公斤邮费六角，超过一公斤不满两公斤的也按两公斤计算。这时，我有点犹豫，因为只超过八公分就要多花六角钱有些不值得。
    这位营业员猜透了我的心思，于是她问我雨靴是用什么包的？我回答说包着两层纸。她沉思了片刻说有办法。说着她找来剪刀、针线，征求我的同意后把包裹拆开，取出里面的报纸，然后再一秤，重量恰好降到一公斤。我笑了，她也笑了。最后她还帮助我把包裹缝上。
    这位营业员热情为群众服务的作风使我非常感动，几天来都不能把这件事忘掉。
