Press On to Scale the Summit

Heilongjiang Consolidates Literacy Achievements with “Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters” Campaign

(Our dispatch) This reporter Lin Mo reports: Heilongjiang Province, the first in the country to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, has launched a province-wide "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" campaign among workers and farmers to further consolidate literacy achievements and meet the technical and cultural revolutions. At the same time, many spare-time middle schools and spare-time primary schools are being established.

In a short period, more than 13,000 spare-time middle schools and more than 126,000 spare-time primary schools have been established throughout the province, with more than 1.1 million people participating in the study, most of whom are farmers, workers, and cadres who have graduated from literacy classes. The content of the study combines culture, technology, and politics. The instructors are local middle and primary school teachers, cadres sent to lower levels, and technical cadres. The subjects of study are tailored to local conditions and people. The situation of the Great Leap Forward in production is pressing, and after becoming literate, the masses are eager to further study scientific and technical knowledge and improve their political awareness. Township and commune cadres have seen the significant role of learning culture and technology in improving production and are very active in preparing spare-time schools.

Simultaneous with the establishment of various spare-time schools, the province has launched a "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" study campaign among the working class and peasantry who have graduated from literacy classes, to consolidate literacy achievements and popularize cultural and scientific and technical knowledge. The catchy slogan "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" came from the masses, and it was first started by the Fengtian Agricultural Cooperative in Jiejixiang Township, Tailai County, in this province. Fengtian Cooperative basically eliminated illiteracy a year ago. After the end of the literacy campaign, the Party branch of the cooperative noticed two different phenomena: One was that some people who had removed the label of illiteracy developed a slack and tired attitude towards learning. For example, female student Shao Shupu said, "These few months have tied me up. This time you can't control me, so don't look for me to study anymore." Due to the relaxation of study, some of the literacy graduates have regressed to semi-literacy. Some people were dissatisfied with the style of studying in this gust of wind, saying that it was "hard work to learn, and throw it away after finishing." The other phenomenon was that some people insisted on studying unremittingly after becoming literate, read many books, wrote many characters, and began to use them in production and work. After discussing and analyzing this situation, the Party branch believed that the achievements gained through hard work must not be discarded casually and that we must not climb halfway up the mountain and then roll down. We must continue to consolidate and improve and move forward. Therefore, it further proposed to read more, write more, and practice more, calling on each literacy graduate to "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters."

In the reading movement, they further summarized the experience of Chen Lu and others in persisting in reading: At first, reading technical books with many unfamiliar characters was boring and difficult to read. They started with story books and picture books, and the method was to stare at one book and read it repeatedly, seven or eight times to more than ten times, and gradually understood the content and developed interest. Later, each team carried a mobile library box when going to the fields. During breaks, the librarian would introduce favorite books to everyone; each team was equipped with tutors to answer unfamiliar characters, and everyone turned learning into entertainment. A reading atmosphere rose throughout the cooperative.

After everyone had a certain reading ability, the scope of reading also expanded accordingly. The leading cadres of the cooperative generally wanted to read books on the management of agricultural cooperatives and "experience in running large cooperatives"; production activists wanted to read books on improved technology and agricultural science knowledge; ordinary women wanted to read hygiene knowledge and how to raise children; young people needed books on youth cultivation. The masses' need for books and newspapers increased greatly. At present, the whole cooperative has subscribed to 160 copies of various newspapers, and the library has nearly a thousand books of various kinds.

Their "write ten thousand characters" began in conjunction with reading. They copied whatever they read, and wrote unfamiliar characters several times to become proficient. Soon, it quickly turned to "writing about reality," that is, writing and applying in connection with production and daily life, such as writing notes, keeping work records, writing letters, writing production plans, production experience, and so on. During the socialist debate last winter, students of the cooperative wrote more than 800 big-character posters.

The "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" campaign has achieved good results in Fengtian Cooperative. In less than a year, each of the 125 young and middle-aged people has read 30 or 40 books, and Zhou Chenfu, who has the best results, has read more than 100 books. The vast majority of students have completed the plan to write ten thousand characters. Due to the improvement of culture, the cooperative's implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines is faster, and new agricultural technologies are easier to promote. Several students of the cooperative, based on the introduction in newspapers and periodicals and referring to local agricultural tools, created a "double-ridge weeding harrow," which increased efficiency by two times compared with the old agricultural tools, while saving two horses and eight manpower.

After Tailai County triumphantly reported the victory of literacy at the beginning of April this year, it immediately introduced and promoted the experience of Fengtian Cooperative in "Reading One Hundred Books, Writing Ten Thousand Characters" throughout the county. After the reading and writing campaign was launched among the farmers of the county, more than 20,000 copies of popular reading materials in the bookstore were snapped up, but they still could not meet the needs of the masses. The county leaders immediately tried to find ways from many aspects to meet the needs of the masses. First, they mobilized all the county's organs, enterprises, and schools to donate books. They decided that seven systems, namely Party and government organs, culture and education, industry, railways, health, commerce, and joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises, should respectively contract for several agricultural cooperatives, and the cadres of each system should automatically donate reading materials suitable for farmers or voluntarily donate money to purchase books uniformly, and put these books into easy-to-store library boxes and send them to relevant agricultural cooperatives. Using this method, 25,000 copies of various books have been sent to farmers. At the same time, combined with Tailai County's long-term plan, they compiled books of this county by themselves. The county party committee has compiled a book "What Will Tailai County Become Like in Three Years"; in addition, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, health, culture and education, commercial and other departments have also compiled several articles based on their department's policies and plans. The Agriculture Bureau also specially compiled a textbook on agricultural technology.

Through such a reading movement, not only has the achievement of literacy been consolidated, but also the ideological realm of the peasants has been broadened, and the peasants have learned scientific and technical knowledge, which is closely linked to the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and to the technical revolution and cultural revolution.

A massive technical revolution and cultural revolution has begun to appear throughout the province. The "Read One Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" campaign has spread to the vast rural areas and factories and mines of Heilongjiang Province. The masses buy books themselves, organ cadres donate books, relevant departments of each county compile books themselves, and the province's publishing departments are working even harder day and night. In Longjiang County, in the month and more after the literacy campaign was triumphantly concluded, bookstores sold more than 180,000 books; the circulation of the county newspaper increased from 2,500 copies to 31,000 copies, an increase of more than eleven times.

　　一鼓作气  爬上山顶峰
    黑龙江巩固扫盲成果展开“读百本书、写万个字”运动
    本报讯　记者林沫报道：全国第一个基本扫除了青壮年文盲的黑龙江省，为了巩固扫盲成果，迎接技术革命和文化革命，在全省工人、农民中进一步展开了“读百本书、写万个字”的巩固扫盲成果运动，同时大办业余中学和业余小学。
    在短时期内，全省已建立业余中学一万三千多所，业余小学十二万六千多所，参加学习的有一百一十多万人，其中绝大部分是扫盲毕业的农民、工人和干部，学习内容是文化、技术、政治三者相结合。担任教学的是地方上的中、小学教师、下放干部和技术干部。学习的科目是因地、因人制宜。生产大跃进的形势逼人，群众在识字之后，迫切要求进一步学习科学技术知识，提高政治觉悟。乡、社干部看到了学习文化、技术对提高生产的显著作用，对筹办业余学校十分积极。
    和建立各种业余学校的同时，全省在扫盲毕业的工农群众中，展开了“读百本书、写万个字”的学习运动，以巩固扫盲成果，普及文化和科学技术知识。“读百本书、写万个字”这个响亮的口号来自群众，它首先是由这个省的泰来县街基乡的丰田农业社开始的。丰田社在一年前就基本上扫除了文盲。扫盲结束后，这个社的党支部觉察到两种不同的现象：一种是，部分摘掉文盲帽子的人，对学习产生了松劲和歇气情绪，如女学员邵淑铺说：“这几个月把我缠住了，这回你可管不着我了，别再找我学习了。”由于放松学习，在扫盲毕业的学员中，又有人回生到半文盲。有的人对这一阵风的学习方式不满，说这是“学习下苦功，扫完就算扔”。另一种现象是，有的人在扫盲后坚持不懈的学习，读了不少书，写了许多字，并开始用之于生产和工作。党支部讨论分析了这种情况之后，认为苦学得来的成绩，决不能随便扔掉，不能够爬到半山坡再滚下来，必须继续巩固提高向前迈进；于是进一步提出，要多读、多写、多练，号召每个扫盲毕业的学生要“读一百本书，写一万个字”。
    在读书运动中，他们进一步总结了陈禄等人坚持阅读的经验：起初读技术性的书，生字多，觉得枯燥无味，读不下去。他们就从故事书、画册读起，方法是：盯住一本返复阅读，读七八遍到十几遍，就逐渐理解了内容，产生了兴趣。后来各队下地都背上流动图书箱。休息时，图书员就给各人介绍喜爱的书；各队都配备了辅导员，解答生字，大家把学习变成了娱乐。全社兴起了读书之风。
    大家有了一定的阅读能力之后，阅读范围也就随之扩大。社队的领导干部一般愿看关于农业社的经营管理及“办大社的经验”的书；生产积极分子愿看改良技术和农业科学知识的书；一般妇女要读卫生常识、怎样带娃娃；青年则需要有关青年修养等书。群众对书刊报纸的需要大增，现全社共订了各种报纸一百六十份，图书馆有各种图书近千册。
    他们的“写万个字”，开始是结合阅读进行的，读什么就抄写什么；生字多写几遍，求其熟练。不久就很快转向“写实际”，即结合生产和日常生活进行写作，练习应用。如写便条、记工账、写信、写生产计划、生产经验，等等。去冬进行社会主义大辩论，全社学员共写了八百多张大字报。
    “读百本书、写万个字”运动在丰田社获得很好的效果，一百二十五名青壮年，不足一年，每人都已读了三、四十本书，成绩最好的周成富已读了一百多本。对写万个字，则绝大多数学员已完成计划。由于文化提高，该社对党的政策方针贯彻的快，农业的新技术容易推广。该社几个学员，根据报刊的介绍，参照本地的农具，创造了“双垅耲耙”，较旧农具提高效率两倍，同时节省两匹马和八个人力。
    泰来县在今年4月初全县扫盲胜利报捷之后，立即向全县介绍和推广丰田社“读百本书、写万个字”的经验。在全县农民展开了读写运动之后，书店的两万多册通俗读物被抢购一空，但仍不能满足群众的需要。县的领导上立即从多方面想办法，满足群众的需要。首先发动全县各机关、企业、学校献书。他们确定由党政机关、文教、工业、铁路、卫生、商业、合营工商业等七个系统，分别包干几个农业社，由各系统干部自动捐献适合农民的读物，或自愿捐款，统一购书，并把这些书装上便于保管的图书箱，送给有关农业社。用这个办法，已送给农民各种图书二万五千册。同时，还结合泰来县的远景规划，自己动手编本县的书。县委已经编写了一本“泰来县三年后变成什么样”；另外，农、林、水、卫生、文教、商业等部门，也都根据本部门的方针政策和规划远景，各编若干篇；农业局还专门编了一本农业技术教材。
    通过这样的读书运动，不仅巩固了扫盲成绩，同时，也开阔了农民的思想境界，使农民学得了科学技术知识，这就和农业生产大跃进，和技术革命和文化革命密切联系起来了。
    一个声势浩大的技术革命和文化革命已开始在全省出现。“读百本书、写万个字”的运动已扩展到黑龙江省广大农村和厂矿。群众自己买书，机关干部献书，各县有关部门自己动手编书，省的出版部门则更是日夜快马加鞭。龙江县在扫盲告捷后的一个多月中，书店售出书籍十八万多册；县报发行量由二千五百份上升到三万一千份，增加了十一倍多。
