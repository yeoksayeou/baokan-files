In the People's Liberation Army, the rectification movement must also be carried through to the end. The People's Liberation Army is the defender of the socialist cause and also the builder of the socialist cause. It has a glorious tradition of diligence, bravery, hard work, plain living, and close ties with the masses. Through the rectification movement, the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army has been further promoted, the relationship between officers and soldiers, between superiors and subordinates, and between the military and civilians has become closer, and the leadership of the party committees at all levels over the army has also been strengthened. These achievements of the rectification movement should be conscientiously consolidated.

　　在人民解放军中，同样必须把整风运动进行到底。人民解放军是社会主义事业的保卫者，又是社会主义事业的建设者。它具有勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的光荣传统。经过整风，人民解放军的光荣传统得到了进一步的发扬，军队的上下级之间、官兵之间和军民之间的关系更密切了，各级党委对军队的领导也加强了。整风运动的这些成果，应当认真地巩固起来。
