Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 24th: This reporter learned from the East China Region's Four Provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui) and One City (Shanghai) Agricultural Cooperation Conference currently being held in Hefei City: This year, not only have large numbers of high-yield wheat fields with yields exceeding 1,000 *jin* appeared everywhere, but also various summer-ripening crops such as rapeseed, broad beans, peas, spring potatoes, and red clover (*ziyunying*) have all set high production records.

    Jiangsu Province, where rapeseed production increased by 57%, saw four counties—Nanhui, Fengxian, Taicang, and Xinghua—achieve an average rapeseed yield of over 200 *jin* per *mu*. The common reasons for their achieving large-scale high yields were the adoption of improved varieties, close planting, and increased fertilizer application. In the Gaochao Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hefei City, Anhui Province, 3.217 *mu* of rapeseed yielded 758.15 *jin* of rapeseed per *mu*, with one *mu* yielding over 1,000 *jin* of rapeseed.

    A spring potato yield record of 20,000 *jin* per *mu* appeared in the QinJian Agricultural Cooperative in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province. This cooperative's 93.9 *mu* of spring potatoes adopted measures such as early planting, close planting, sufficient base fertilizer, timely topdressing, and diligent weeding, achieving an average yield of 7,000 *jin* per *mu*. Ten *mu* produced over 210,000 *jin* of potatoes, averaging 20,861 *jin* per *mu*.

    Broad beans and peas, which were previously considered low-yielding crops, have also achieved high-yield records. Du Shaoding, Du Aihe, and Du Renchun, cadres of the Fourth Production Team of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui Province, harvested 1,775 *jin* of broad beans from their 1.2 *mu* experimental field, averaging 1,478 *jin* per *mu*. The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in the same county recently harvested 7.5 *mu* of peas, which were supervised and checked by the township Party committee and the cooperative. The average yield was over 580 *jin* per *mu*, with 3.5 *mu* yielding 1,249 *jin* per *mu*, more than twice the local average pea yield.

    The green manure crop—red clover—in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, has also seen unprecedented high yields. Although Yanwu Township in this county is a barren mountainous area, the 163.25 *mu* of red clover trial-planted last winter, after being actually weighed and measured by the township Party committee and cadres of various agricultural cooperatives, averaged over 28,000 *jin* per *mu*. Among them, 28.375 *mu* averaged 55,500 *jin* per *mu*, about ten times higher than the red clover yield in general areas. Because this green manure crop can be planted in fields, mulberry gardens, tea gardens, and orchards, has a great fertilizer effect, and is rich in protein, making it a good concentrated feed, the representatives attending the meeting were very interested in the high yield of red clover.

### 低产作物挤进高产行列  华东地区各种夏收作物创丰产纪录

    低产作物挤进高产行列
    华东地区各种夏收作物创丰产纪录
    新华社合肥24日电　记者从正在合肥市举行的华东区四省（苏、浙、闽、皖）一市（上海）农业协作会议上获悉：各地今年不但大量地出现了千斤以上的小麦丰产田，而且油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、春马铃薯和红花草（紫云英）等各种夏熟作物，也都创造了高额的丰产纪录。
    油菜增产57％的江苏省，出现了南汇、奉贤、太仓、兴化等四个油菜平均亩产二百斤以上的县。采用良种、密植和增施肥料是它们取得大面积丰产的共同原因。在安徽省合肥市郊区的高潮农业社，有三亩二分一厘七毫油菜，每亩产菜籽七百五十八斤十五两，其中有一亩产油菜籽达千斤以上。
    春马铃薯亩产双万斤的丰产纪录出现在浙江省丽水县的勤俭农业社。这个社的九十三亩九分春马铃薯采取早播密植，施足基肥，适时追肥和勤除杂草等措施，平均亩产七千斤，有十亩一分共产马铃薯二十一万多斤。每亩合二万零八百六十一斤。
    过去被认为是低产作物的蚕豆和豌豆，也获得了高产纪录。安徽省肥东县曙光农业社第四生产队干部杜少顶、杜爱和、杜仁存三人种的一亩二分蚕豆试验田，共收蚕豆一千七百七十五斤，平均亩产一千四百七十八斤。这个县的红星农业社，最近收割的七亩五分豌豆，经乡党委和社里派人监收监打，每亩平均收了五百八十多斤，其中有三亩五分单产一千二百四十九斤，比当地一般豌豆产量高出两倍多。
    浙江省丽水县的绿肥——红花草，也出现了空前未有的高额产量。这个县的严乌乡虽然是土地瘠薄的高山区，去冬试种的一百六十三亩二分五厘红花草，经过乡党委和各农业社干部实称结果，每亩平均收二万八千多斤，其中有二十八点三七五亩，平均亩产达五万五千五百斤，比一般地区的红花草产量高出了十倍左右。由于红花草这种绿肥在田地里、桑园、茶园和果园里都能种植，肥效大，而且含蛋白质丰富，也是很好的精饲料，所以到会代表对红花草的丰产都很感兴趣。
