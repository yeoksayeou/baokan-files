In the technical revolution to create miracles

    Wang Fengqi: A Master of Technical Innovation
    Creating Seven New Farm Tools in Just Over a Month
    Recently, a sensational miracle occurred in the mountainous area of Chifeng County, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia: a young man successively created seven new farm tools in just over a month. The creator of these new farm tools is not a technician, nor an experienced carpenter, but Wang Fengqi, a 24-year-old member of the Communist Youth League and member of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative who only attended private school for three months.
    Not long ago, Wang Fengqi used wood to make models, without tools such as saws or drills, so he heated iron bars red hot to burn through the wood. With the help of local carpenters, he finally made a hand-cranked waterwheel. This waterwheel can irrigate five and a half mu of land a day, not only saving two manpower compared to the Liberation-type waterwheel, but also irrigating three and a half mu more land.
    Wang Fengqi did not become arrogant and complacent because of this success, and began to study and create a quick mill. With the support of the leadership and the cooperation of the cooperative members, on the basis of the old mill, using the cooperative's waste materials, piecing them together, a fast animal-powered mill was born, which increased the efficiency of the old mill by five times. Following that, this young man created five other tools: a foot-operated waterwheel, a Leap Forward waterwheel, a simple "foreign" well, a water press, and a soybean vortex plow. The new farm tools he made solved many difficult problems for the cooperative and improved production efficiency. It only cost the cooperative five yuan to manufacture this batch of tools. Currently, Wang Fengqi is continuing to research and create a manure spreader and new summer hoeing and thinning tools.
    Wang Fengqi's moving deeds of daring to think, dare to act, and dare to create quickly spread throughout Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded Wang Fengqi the title of "Youth Technical Innovation Master."

    王凤歧——技术革新的能手
    一个多月创造了七种新农具
    内蒙古昭乌达盟赤峰县山区，最近出现了一件轰动人心的奇迹：一个年轻人在一个多月里接连创造出七种新农具。这些新农具的创造者，不是技术人员，也不是富有经验的木匠，而是一个只念过三个月私塾的黎明农业社社员、二十四岁的共青团员王凤歧。
    不久以前，王凤歧用木料做模型，没有锯、钻等工具，便烧红了铁条烫。由于当地木匠的帮助，他终于制成了一台手摇水车。这水车一天能浇五亩半地，不但比解放式水车节省两个人力，还多浇三亩半地。
    王凤歧没有为这个成功骄傲自满，又开始研究创造快磨。在领导的支持和社员们的协作下，在旧磨的基础上，利用社里的废物废料，东拼西凑，一台快速畜力牵引磨又诞生了，它比旧磨的效率提高了五倍。接着，这位年轻人又创制出脚踏水车、跃进水车、简易洋井、压水机、大豆旋窝犁等五种工具。他制成的这些新农具，给社里解决了不少困难问题，提高了生产效率。制造这批工具只花了社里五元钱。目前，王凤歧还在继续研究创制出粪机、新的夏锄和间苗工具。
    王凤歧敢想、敢做、敢创造的动人事迹，很快地传遍了内蒙古各地。共青团内蒙古自治区委员会授予王凤歧以“青年技术革新能手”的称号。
