Let Opera Reflect Modern Life More and Better
By Renmin Ribao Commentator

    In the socialist Great Leap Forward, many operas reflecting the new people and new things of socialism have emerged in various places. These operas not only demonstrate the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in socialist construction, but also inherit and develop the tradition of opera, expressing it in a form that the people love to see and hear, and are therefore welcomed by the audience. This creative activity is very broad in scope, and many opera genres and troupes have boldly created under the inspiration of enthusiasm for building socialism. The goal that has been continuously strived for in opera reform work for many years has now been initially realized. Modern life has been successfully represented on many opera stages; the vivid images of Communists, cadres, and positive characters have been successfully created; traditional performance methods have been successfully used to express modern characters; and the music has been creative without breaking away from tradition. These achievements are, of course, inseparable from the efforts of opera reform work for many years, but the high enthusiasm and daring spirit of opera workers in this Great Leap Forward are indeed a direct driving force.
    In order to make this movement more popular, exchange advanced experiences in a timely manner, and further improve the level of creation, the Ministry of Culture convened a national symposium on opera reflecting modern life, and transferred several troupes with a longer history and more experience in reflecting modern life, and with more successful new creations in this Great Leap Forward, to Beijing to combine with the new programs of Beijing opera troupes for a joint performance for observation. This symposium and joint performance are very necessary and timely. The history of opera reflecting modern life cannot be considered short. Since the Revolution of 1911, every revolutionary movement has always set off a climax. Although these past climaxes could not be well continued for various reasons, they have left a wealth of experience each time. Since Chairman Mao published "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art", especially after liberation, there have been more successful experiences, but they have still not been seriously summarized. As a result, although its history is long and its experience is abundant, it is still in a state of being piecemeal and unsystematic, and has not been elevated to the height of theory. This makes opera in the aspect of reflecting modern life, sometimes inevitably repeats the mistakes it has made before, or goes to explore the problems that predecessors have already solved, which makes the pace of work that should be advanced faster, but is slowed down instead. This symposium and joint performance will undoubtedly achieve many results in summarizing and exchanging experiences, and play a role in promoting opera to reflect modern life.
    However, there are still some people who lack confidence in it, believing that modern opera is always inferior to traditional repertoires in terms of artistic level and cannot attract audiences; and that although modern opera is very sensational now, it is in the midst of a movement climax, and when the climax is over, it will no longer be popular, and so on. These views are very superficial, very wrong, and also very harmful.
    The development of opera in reflecting modern life, like any other movement, cannot be a straight line upward, but has a stage of vigorous development, and also a stage of consolidation and improvement. Since liberation, some people have not understood this principle. Seeing that modern opera was very popular among audiences at the beginning of liberation, they thought that traditional repertoires were useless and only wanted to stage 100% new repertoires, which resulted in shoddy work, greatly damaged the audience's enthusiasm for modern opera, and instead affected the progress of the movement. If we understand this law of movement and can do a good job of consolidation and improvement in a timely and appropriate manner on the basis of wide popularization, new modern repertoires that are welcomed by the audience will continue to emerge on the opera stage, and will gradually accumulate into a batch of retained repertoires.
    Does this mean that we should do less popularization and more improvement? No. We must go to the countryside and mountains more, send new repertoires to factories and rural areas, and assist the amateur opera activities in those factories and rural areas. Not only help them grow, but also absorb nutrients from their creations, so that the creations of our professional opera troupes will be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. To attach importance to the literature and art produced by the working people in the construction of socialism, and to exchange them with our professional creations, learn from them, and improve them, is the only way to ensure that our new opera never deviates from the audience and is always full of creativity.
    Another point is that: recognizing tradition is not just a matter of recognizing a certain proportion of traditional repertoires in the repertoire, but also a matter of having to start from tradition. Not starting from tradition means violating the audience's appreciation habits, which means deviating from the masses. But since it is "starting", we have to move forward. If we think that we cannot leave tradition even one step, then we cannot express the new people and new things that did not exist in the past, but only exist today, which is also deviating from the masses.
    In the Great Leap Forward, opera reflected the new life in many aspects, and also created a variety of techniques to reflect the new life. We should attach great importance to this liberated creativity and greatly promote it, so as to make our opera art gain new prosperity and development.

    让戏曲更多更好地反映现代生活
    本报评论员
    在社会主义大跃进中，各地出现了许多表现社会主义新人新事的戏曲。这些戏曲，既表现了广大人民在社会主义建设中的干劲，又继承和发展了戏曲的传统，用人民所喜闻乐见的形式表现出来，因此受到了观众的欢迎。这次的创作活动范围很广，许多剧种和剧团都在建设社会主义的热情鼓舞之下，大胆地进行了创造。多少年来戏曲改革工作上所不断努力以求达到的目标，现在初步实现了。在许多戏曲舞台上比较成功地表现了现代生活；成功地创造了共产党员、干部、和正面人物的有血有肉的形象；成功地运用了传统的表演方法来表现现代的人物；音乐上做到了又有创造又不脱离传统等等。这些成绩，当然和戏改工作多年的努力分不开，但这次在大跃进中戏曲工作者的高度热情和敢想敢干的精神，实在是直接的促进力量。
    文化部为了使这个运动更加普及，并且及时交流先进的经验，让创作水平能更加提高一步，召集了全国性的戏曲表现现代生活的座谈会，并调来了几个在表现现代生活上历史较长、经验较多，在这次大跃进中有较成功的新创作的剧团来京，结合北京各戏曲剧团的新节目进行联合公演，以作观摩。这次的座谈会和联合公演是很必要的，也是很及时的。戏曲表现现代生活的历史不能算短，从辛亥革命以来，每一次革命运动中总是掀起一个高潮，这些过去的高潮虽然因为种种原因而不能很好地继续下去，但每次都留下了丰富的经验。自从毛主席发表了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以来，特别是解放以后，成功的经验尤其多，但也仍然没有进行认真的总结。以致它的历史虽然长，经验虽然多，却仍旧在点点滴滴、不成系统的状态中间，没有提升到理论的高度。这使得戏曲在表现现代生活的方面，有时不免重犯以前犯过的毛病，或者重去摸索前人已经解决的问题，这样使得应当前进得快些的工作步调反而慢了。这次的座谈会和公演无疑地能在总结和交流经验上得到很多成绩，对戏曲表现现代生活起促进的作用。
    但是现在也还有些人对它缺乏信心，认为现代戏在艺术水平上总不及传统剧目，不能吸引观众；又认为现代戏现在虽然很轰动，但这是在运动高潮之中，当高潮一过去，它又要不吃香了等等。这些看法是很表面的，很错误的，也是很有害的。
    戏曲在表现现代生活的发展上，也和别的任何运动一样，不能是直线上升的，而是有蓬勃发展的阶段，也有巩固提高的阶段的。解放以来，曾经有些人不懂这个道理，看见解放之初现代戏在观众中很受欢迎，就以为传统剧目没有用了，只想上演百分之百的新剧目，这就形成了粗制滥造，大大损伤了观众对于现代戏的热情，反而影响运动的进展。如果我们懂得了运动的这种规律，能够在广泛普及的基础上及时地、适当地做好巩固与提高的工作，戏曲舞台上是会不断涌现为观众所欢迎的现代新剧目，并会逐渐积累成批保留剧目。
    这是不是说我们应当少搞些普及，多搞些提高呢？不是。我们必须多多下乡上山，将新的剧目送到工厂农村中去，并且多多协助那些工厂农村的业余戏曲活动。不仅仅帮助它们成长，而且从他们的创作中间吸取养料，这样，我们专业戏曲团体的创作才会得到取之不尽用之不竭的生命力。重视劳动人民在建设社会主义中间所产生的文艺，并且把它们和我们的专业创作互相交流，学习它们，提高它们，这是保证我们新戏曲永不脱离观众，永远创作力充沛的不二法门。
    另外一点是：承认传统，不只是承认传统剧目在上演剧目中的一定比例的问题，而且还是一个必须从传统出发的问题。不从传统出发，就是违背了观众的欣赏习惯，就是脱离群众。但既然是“出发”，就得往前走去，如果认为一步也不能离开传统，那就无法表现那些过去没有，只有今天才有的新人新事，这同样也是脱离群众。
    在大跃进中，戏曲反映了多方面的新生活，也创造了多种多样反映新生活的手法。我们应该十分重视这种被解放了的创造力，大大加以发扬，从而使我们的戏曲艺术获得新的繁荣和发展。
