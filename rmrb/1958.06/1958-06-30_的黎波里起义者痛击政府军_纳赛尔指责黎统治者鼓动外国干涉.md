Reported by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency: Fierce battles occurred between Lebanese rebel forces and Chamoun government armed forces on the 28th in Tripoli, Saida, Beirut, and other places.

According to a broadcast from the Voice of Free Lebanon radio station, the People's Army headquarters in Tripoli issued a statement on the 28th stating that the People's Army launched an offensive against Chamoun's armed forces in and around the city of Tripoli, forcing them to withdraw from some strongholds in the suburbs.

News from Beirut said that this offensive by the Tripoli rebels was the most intense in fifty days. The Chamoun government admitted in a communique issued on the 28th that the Tripoli rebels used heavy mortars to launch a fierce attack on the positions of the Chamoun troops; the battle continued throughout the night. Government forces dispatched rocket-launching aircraft in an attempt to stop the rebel offensive.

According to Cairo Radio, the important southern city of Mirjayoun has been surrounded by the insurgent people.

As the United States and Britain intensified their plans for armed intervention in Lebanon, British Labor Party leader Gaitskell stated in a radio address on the evening of the 28th that he opposed direct US and British intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs, advocating instead for intervention under the banner of the United Nations using troops from "neutral countries."

Gaitskell's perspective is purely from the standpoint of safeguarding Western interests. He believes that "if American and British troops land in Lebanon, it will cause serious repercussions throughout the Middle East," which would be detrimental to the West. Therefore, using the name of the United Nations and using troops from "neutral countries" for intervention is "much smarter."

On the US side, according to an article filed from New York by "Daily Herald" reporter Sampson on the 27th, some US military leaders oppose US and British intervention in Lebanon because it would mean indefinitely trapping US troops in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 29th: President Nasser said in an interview with "Al-Shaab" today that the Lebanese rulers' renewed accusations of larger-scale interference by the so-called United Arab Republic are aimed at inciting foreign powers to deal with the Lebanese people.

Nasser said that the Lebanese rulers have been accusing the United Arab Republic from the very beginning of the revolution, trying to use every means to turn the domestic crisis into an international crisis. They are asking the United States and Britain to occupy Lebanon, quell the revolution, and harm the Lebanese people.

    的黎波里起义者痛击政府军
    纳赛尔指责黎统治者鼓动外国干涉
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：黎巴嫩起义部队和夏蒙政府武装力量28日在的黎波里、赛伊达和贝鲁特等地都发生了激烈战斗。
    据自由黎巴嫩之声电台广播，的黎波里的人民军总部28日发表声明说，人民军在的黎波里城内和郊区向夏蒙的武装力量发动了进攻，并且迫使他们撤出郊区的一些据点。
    来自贝鲁特的消息说，的黎波里起义者的这次进攻是五十天来最猛烈的一次。夏蒙政府在28日发表的公报承认，的黎波里起义者使用重迫击炮向夏蒙部队的阵地发动了猛烈进攻；战斗彻夜进行。政府军出动了能够发射火箭的飞机，企图阻挡起义者的攻势。
    据开罗电台报道，南部重要城市米尔扎尤尼已被起义人民包围。
    在美英两国加紧策划武装干涉黎巴嫩的时候，英国工党领袖盖次克尔28日晚间在一篇广播演说中表示反对美英直接干涉黎巴嫩内政，而主张在联合国的招牌下利用“中立国家”的军队来进行干涉。
    盖次克尔是纯粹从维护西方的利益着眼的。他认为，“如果美国和英国军队在黎巴嫩登陆，就会在整个中东引起严重的反响”，从而对西方不利。因此，利用联合国的名义和利用“中立国家”的军队来进行干涉，就“聪明得多”。
    在美国方面，据伦敦“每日先驱报”在27日刊载的记者桑普森从纽约发回来的一篇文章说，美国有一些军事领袖反对美英干涉黎巴嫩，因为这将意味着使美国军队无限期地陷在中东。
    据新华社开罗29日电　纳赛尔总统在今天发表的对“人民报”的谈话中说，黎巴嫩统治者重新提出所谓阿拉伯联合共和国进行更大规模的干涉的指责，是为了鼓动外国对付黎巴嫩人民。
    纳赛尔说，黎巴嫩统治者从革命一开始就指责阿拉伯联合共和国，企图用一切办法把国内危机变成国际危机。他们要求美国和英国占领黎巴嫩，扑灭革命，残害黎巴嫩人民。
