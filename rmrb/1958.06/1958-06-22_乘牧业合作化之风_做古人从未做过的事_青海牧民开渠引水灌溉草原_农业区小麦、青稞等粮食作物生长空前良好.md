Riding the Wave of Pastoral Cooperativization, Doing What the Ancients Never Did
Qinghai Herdsmen Dig Canals to Divert Water to Irrigate Grasslands
Unprecedented Good Growth of Wheat, Highland Barley, and Other Grain Crops in Agricultural Areas
(Our Dispatch) Reporter Peng Xue reports: Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, herding masses in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, riding the wave of pastoral cooperativization, are vigorously constructing grassland water conservancy projects. Since this spring, they have newly built 635 canals of various sizes, more than 20 water storage ponds, and more than 60 dams, which can irrigate more than 4 million mu of grassland, exceeding the planned irrigated grassland area for this year by more than 1 million mu. In areas that can be irrigated, the pasture is now lush and green, and the problem of drinking water for people and livestock has been completely solved.

Qinghai's pastoral areas lack rainfall and are often threatened by drought, preventing full utilization of the grasslands. Some areas with good pasture cannot be grazed because of the lack of drinking water for people and livestock. However, constructing canals to irrigate grasslands in pastoral areas is unprecedented in Qinghai's history. This year, after the pastoral areas launched a high tide of cooperativization and production movement, the minds of the broad masses of laboring herdsmen were liberated, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. With the help of Han cadres, herdsmen in many places built canals, dug wells, and built dams during the day, and engaged in cooperativization in the evening. The Chaka District of Dulan County built an 8-kilometer canal, which the district originally planned to complete in 20 days, but was completed in two days and two nights. In the construction of water conservancy projects, herdsmen in various places "everyone thinks of a way, and everyone contributes ideas," giving full play to collective wisdom and overcoming many difficulties encountered in canal construction. Zongjia Township in this county did not have steel and cement to build a water-blocking dam in the construction of a canal more than 20 kilometers long, so they used local red willow, reeds, white thorns, and sandbags instead.

(Our Dispatch) After the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province basically realized pastoral cooperativization, they immediately launched an unprecedented high tide of production.

The broad masses of male and female herding masses and some pastoral owners who joined the joint state-private pastoral farms moved their tents to the construction sites, built canals during the day, discussed the establishment of various systems for societies and farms in the evening, and also drew some people to take turns day and night to receive and raise calves and foals. Due to the high morale of the masses and the good organization of labor, the survival rate of calves and foals this year is higher than in any previous year, averaging around 95%. Many societies and farms have reached 100%. A bumper harvest of calves and foals is a foregone conclusion. In order to keep the livestock strong and fat, the time to leave the winter pasture and go to the spring pasture for grazing this year has also been advanced by about half a month. Qilian County in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture also organized more than 300 people to go to the mountains to hunt wolves, bears, leopards, and other harmful animals to protect livestock.

At the same time, herdsmen in the two autonomous prefectures are making preparations for settlement and grassland planning. Herdsmen in the Haibei area can basically settle down completely within this year. Herdsmen in Haiyan, Weiyuan, and other pastoral areas have reclaimed wasteland at the settlement sites and planted wheat, highland barley, oats, potatoes, and other crops, striving to achieve partial self-sufficiency in grain and more abundant feed for livestock over the winter.

(Our Dispatch) Wheat, highland barley, and other grain crops on the Qinghai Plateau are growing unprecedentedly well this year. In the river valleys on both sides of the Yellow River and the Huangshui River, spring wheat three or four feet high is heading and flowering, and early-maturing highland barley is bowing its head with long-awned ears. In the mountainous areas where planting was later, wheat seedlings have also grown to about one foot high. Farmers of all ethnic groups are stepping up topdressing, weeding, and preventing frost, lodging, and pests.

Among the four million mu of wheat crops on the plateau, the wheat fields of more than 30 state-owned farms are growing best. The 20,000 mu of green wheat fields in Delingha Farm are like a brocade, with more than 400,000 original seedlings per mu, each dividing into two or three tillers. Wheat fields, broad beans, potatoes, and other crops in various counties in the agricultural area are all growing vigorously.

This year, grain crops on the Qinghai Plateau were generally sown earlier than in previous years, and at the same time, water conservancy, fertilizer, and field management were tightly grasped. The newly built water conservancy projects last winter and this spring have already benefited 640,000 mu. More than 10,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and more attention was paid to inter-tillage and weeding than in previous years.

### 乘牧业合作化之风  做古人从未做过的事  青海牧民开渠引水灌溉草原  农业区小麦、青稞等粮食作物生长空前良好

    乘牧业合作化之风  做古人从未做过的事
    青海牧民开渠引水灌溉草原
    农业区小麦、青稞等粮食作物生长空前良好
    本报讯  记者彭雪报道：青海省牧业区的牧民群众，在总路线的光辉照耀下，乘牧业合作化之风，大力兴修草原水利。今春以来，已经新修大小渠道六百三十五条，涝池二十多个，水坝六十多座，共可灌溉草原四百多万亩，超过今年计划灌溉草原面积一百多万亩。凡是能浇上水的地区，现在牧草油绿如茵，人畜饮水问题也已彻底得到了解决。
    青海牧区雨水缺少，经常受到旱象威胁，草原不能充分利用。有些牧草很好的地方，因为没有人、畜饮水，也不能在那里放牧。但是，在牧业区修渠灌溉草原，是青海自古以来没有的事。今年，牧业区掀起合作化和生产运动的高潮以后，广大劳动牧民思想解放，生产积极性空前高涨。在汉族干部的帮助下很多地方的牧民白天修渠、打井、筑坝，晚上搞合作化。都兰县茶卡区修了一条八公里的水渠，区里原计划二十天修成，结果两天两夜就完工了。各地牧民在兴修水利工程中“人人想办法，个个出主意”，充分发挥集体智慧，克服了在修渠中遇到的很多困难。这个县的宗家乡在修筑一条二十多公里长的水渠中，没有钢材水泥筑拦水坝，他们就用当地所产的红柳、芦苇、白刺和沙袋等代替。
    本报讯  青海省的海北藏族自治州和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州在基本实现了牧业合作化以后，紧接着掀起了空前未有的生产高潮。
    广大男女牧民群众和加入了公私合营牧场的部分牧主，把帐篷搬到工地上，白天修渠，晚上讨论建立社、场的各项制度，并抽出部分人昼夜轮流接育犊、驹。由于群众情绪高涨，劳力组织得好，今年牛犊、马驹的成活率比以往任何一年都高，平均在95％左右。有不少的社、场达到100％。牛犊、马驹的丰收已成定局。为了使牲畜保持体壮膘肥，今年离开冬季牧场到春季牧场放牧的时间也都提前了半月左右。海北藏族自治州祁连县还组织了三百多人上山去打狼和熊、豹等害兽，保护牲畜。
    和这同时，两个自治州的牧民正在进行定居的准备和草原规划。海北地区牧民今年一年内大体上可以全部定居下来。海晏、亹源等牧区的牧民，已在定居点上开垦了荒地，种植上小麦、青稞、燕麦和马铃薯等农作物，争取达到粮食部分自给和牲畜过冬的饲草饲料更加丰裕。
    本报讯  青海高原上的小麦、青稞和其他粮食作物今年生长空前良好。在黄河和湟水两岸的河谷地带，三四尺高的春小麦正在吐穗、扬花，早熟的青稞低下了带着长芒的穗头。播种较晚的山区，麦苗也长到了一尺来高。各族农民正在加劲追肥、除草和预防霜冻、倒伏、虫害。
    高原上的四百万亩麦类作物中，三十多个国营农场的麦田生长最好。德令哈农场的两万亩绿油油的麦田像一片锦绣，每亩原苗超过四十万棵，每棵又分蘖两三株。农业区各县的麦田、蚕豆、马铃薯等都生长旺盛。
    今年，青海高原粮食作物普遍较往年提前播种，同时抓紧了水利、肥料和田间管理三关。去冬今春新修的水利工程已经受益的有六十四万亩。每亩地都施肥一万斤以上，对中耕除草也比往年重视。
