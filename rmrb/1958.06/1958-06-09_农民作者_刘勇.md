　　Peasant Author—Liu Yong
　　By our reporter Kuàng Lù'ān
    Liu Yong is a typical Hunan peasant, now a member of the Qiaoxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiawan Township, Xiangxiang County. Over the past few years, this peasant has written more than ten essays, over forty plays, more than a hundred song lyrics, over a thousand folk songs, compiled six classical operas, over a thousand folk songs, over a hundred folk tales, and over three hundred jokes.
    People may be curious: how could a peasant go from being illiterate or semi-literate to learning to write?
    More than twenty years ago, Liu Yong had studied for three and a half years. However, because his family was poor, he had to put down his books and look after cattle for the landlord. At that time, ten-year-old Liu Yong's desire to study was so urgent that he often looked after cattle for the landlord while reading, or secretly read for a while at night, but the landlord always tried to torture him, making it impossible for him to study. After two years, what he had learned slowly deteriorated, and later he was dismissed by the landlord and returned home, immediately shouldering the burden of supporting his family, making it impossible for him to care about reading and writing. The few characters and words he had learned were almost forgotten. In the year of liberation, Liu Yong, except for still recognizing some numbers and being able to write his family's names, had almost forgotten everything else. In this way, he went from being a semi-literate back to being illiterate.
    After liberation, Liu Yong became a village cadre in 1951. From this time on, he began to pick up books again and attend night school. In night school, he saw many articles written by peasants, which inspired him greatly. He also tried to write folk songs and submit them to the Dazhong Bao (Masses Daily) in the province and the Zhijiang Peasant Newspaper in the special zone. The Party newspaper's cultivation of Liu Yong played a decisive role in his embarking on the path of creation. Those manuscripts he sent to the newspaper received concrete help from the editors of various publications. In order to cultivate him more specifically, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles also specially sent people to his home to help him, absorbing him to participate in relevant meetings and literary workshops, and also selected him to attend the National Youth Literary Creators Representative Conference, giving him a lot of knowledge and strength. The county party committee, township party committee, and cooperative party branch also often absorbed him to participate in various meetings, sending him books and documents to read, improving his political and ideological level. In this way, Liu Yong went from writing folk songs to writing song lyrics, Yu Gu (a type of folk storytelling), Kuaiban (clapper talk), to writing plays, novels, and essays. Over the past few years, he has written many substantial works. For example, "Common Rise" which reflects the class struggle in cooperativization, and several novels reflecting new people and new atmospheres such as "Zhangjiang Ferry" and "Happy Event," are all written very vividly and loved by the masses. However, in the concrete writing process, it was not smooth sailing. When Liu Yong started writing, he could not write five or six out of every ten characters. He learned Gao Yubao's method of using symbols to replace characters, and after writing, he would ask others, learning ten at a time, a hundred in ten times... In only half a year, he recognized many characters and solved the difficulty of not being able to write characters. If the sentences were not smooth, he would read them aloud to others after writing and ask if they could understand them, and revise them if they were not clear. After the manuscript was published, he would carefully compare it, and after doing this, the sentences became smooth. In addition, Liu Yong also paid attention to strengthening political study, actively participating in various political struggles, and observing the surrounding things to improve his ability to analyze problems. For example, in 1954, when Liu Yong's hometown was flooded, he actively fought against the flood with the masses, and after not sleeping for more than ten nights in a row, he wrote the song lyrics "Overcoming the Flood" and the Huaguxi Opera "People Who Are Not Afraid of Difficulties," which were welcomed by the masses after the performance and greatly encouraged flood prevention. Many viewers shouted slogans while watching: "Learn from the people in the play!"
    In order to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, go all out, strive for the top, and strive for a great leap forward in literary and artistic work, at the Second Representative Assembly of Literary and Art Workers held in Hunan Province this time, Liu Yong also put forward his plan for this year, planning to complete 1,567 works of various forms and genres this year, and cultivate more than 20 young authors. By May, he had written more than 600 articles. Now he also serves as a county people's representative, a member of the county political consultative conference, and deputy director of the county amateur literary and artistic creation committee. His work, labor, and creative tasks are very busy, but he is not afraid of fatigue. He said: "I work during the day and write at night. I make drafts in my mind when I work, and write them out when I rest. Only through labor can there be creation. Without labor, there is nothing to write about. Now I want to grab writing materials just like I pick up wild manure. After a turn outside, the basket is full."

专栏：力争上游的人们

　　农民作者——刘勇
　　本报记者　邝麓安
    刘勇是一位典型的湖南农民，现在是湘乡县下湾乡桥乡农业社社员。这个农民几年来已经写了十多篇散文，四十多个剧本，一百多个唱词，一千多首山歌，整理了六个古典戏，一千多首民歌，一百多个民间故事和三百多个笑话。
    人们会好奇：一个农民居然会从文盲、半文盲到学会写作呢？
    还是在二十多年以前，刘勇曾经读过三年半书。可是因为家里穷，以后就只好放下书本替地主家看牛了。当时，十岁的刘勇读书的心愿是那样迫切，他常常背着地主边看牛边看书，或者在晚上偷偷地看一会书，可是地主总是想些办法来折磨他，使他没法读书。这样过了两年，原来读了的书也慢慢地荒废了，以后他被地主辞退回家，又马上分担了一家人的生活担子，更顾不上读书写字，学到的一点生字和词语就忘得差不多了。解放那年，刘勇除了还认得一些数码、会写自己一家的姓名以外，其他的就几乎全忘了。就这样，他又从一个半文盲回到了文盲。
    解放后，刘勇1951年当上了村干部，从这个时候起，他又开始摸起书本上夜校了。在夜校里，他看见很多稿子都是农民写的，对他启发很大，他就也试着写山歌，向省里的大众报、专区的芷江农民报投稿。党报对刘勇的培养，对他走上创作的的道路起了决定性作用。他那些寄到报社的稿件，都得到各报刊编辑的具体帮助。为了更具体地培养他，省文联还专门派人到他家里去帮助他，吸收他参加有关会议和文学讲习班，还选送他出席了全国青年文学创作者代表会议，给了他很多知识和力量。县委、乡党委和社党支部也都经常吸收他参加各种会议，送书、送文件给他看，提高他的政治思想水平。就这样，刘勇从写山歌到写唱词、渔鼓、快板，到写剧本、小说、散文。几年来，写了不少有份量的东西。如反映合作化阶级斗争的“共同上升”，反映新人物、新气象的“张江渡口”、“喜事”等几篇小说，都写得很生动，为群众所喜爱。但是在具体写作中，并不是一帆风顺的。刘勇在开始写稿时，每十个字中就有五六个字写不出来。他就学习高玉宝的用符号代替字的办法，写好以后再去问别人，一次学十个，十次学百个……只有半年多就认识了很多字，解决了写不出字的困难。句子不通顺，写好就念给别人听，问别人是否听得清，不通的即修改。稿件发表后还要认真对照，这样做以后，句子也通顺了。此外，刘勇还注意加强政治学习，积极参加各种政治斗争，观察周围事物，来提高自己分析问题的能力。如1954年刘勇的家乡涨大水，他积极和群众向水灾作斗争，一连十多晚没睡觉，写出了“战胜洪水”的唱词和“不怕困难的人”的花鼓戏，演出后，受到群众欢迎，对防汛起了很大的鼓舞作用，很多观众边看边喊口号：“向剧中人学习！”
    为了多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游，争取文艺工作的大跃进，在这次湖南省召开的文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会上，刘勇又提出了他今年的规划，计划今年要完成各种形式体裁的作品一千五百六十七件，培养青年作者二十多名，到5月他已写出了六百多篇了。现在他还担任县人民代表、县政协委员、县业余文艺创作委员会副主任等职务，工作、劳动、创作任务都很忙，可是他并不怕劳累，他说：“我白天劳动，晚上写作，劳动时打腹稿，休息时就写出来，只有劳动才有创作，离开劳动就没什么东西可写的了。现在我要抓写作的材料就像我拾野粪一样，到外面一转，箢箕就装满了。”
