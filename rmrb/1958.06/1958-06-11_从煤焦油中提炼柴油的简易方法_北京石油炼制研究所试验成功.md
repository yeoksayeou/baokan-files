Simple Method for Extracting Diesel from Coal Tar
    Beijing Petroleum Refining Research Institute Successfully Tested

    (Our Dispatch) The Beijing Petroleum Refining Research Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has successfully tested a simple processing method for extracting diesel from low-temperature coal tar.

    Low-temperature coal tar is a brownish-black viscous oil obtained after the low-temperature carbonization of bituminous coal or lignite. Currently, all countries in the world use high-pressure hydrogenation to refine it into various high-grade light oil products. However, high-pressure hydrogenation refining equipment is very expensive, and the manufacturing and operation technology of the machines are very complex, making large-scale development impossible with China's current level of steel and machinery industries. Recently, due to the large-scale development of coal-to-oil industries in various regions, the Beijing Petroleum Refining Research Institute has successively conducted experiments on four simple processing methods: atmospheric and vacuum distillation centrifugal separation, solvent dilution precipitation, and distillation coking. The first three have already been completely successful, and the fourth is still under experimentation.

    These processing methods are all very simple to operate, and most of the required equipment can be supplied by local machinery factories. For the centrifugal separation method, a milk separator can be used as a substitute if there is no centrifuge. The kettle required for the atmospheric and vacuum distillation method can be manufactured with ordinary steel plates. Therefore, these simple processing methods can be widely adopted even by small-scale refineries run by counties, townships, or even cooperatives.

### 从煤焦油中提炼柴油的简易方法  北京石油炼制研究所试验成功

    从煤焦油中提炼柴油的简易方法
    北京石油炼制研究所试验成功
    本报讯　用简易的加工方法从低温煤焦油中提炼柴油，已经由石油工业部北京石油炼制研究所试验成功。
    低温煤焦油是烟煤或褐煤低温干馏后得到的一种棕黑色的粘稠油液，目前世界各国都用高压加氢的办法把它炼制成各种高级的轻质油品。但是高压加氢的炼油设备很贵，机器的制造和操作技术都很复杂，以我国目前的钢铁、机械工业水平还不可能大量发展。最近由于各地将大量地发展煤炼油工业，北京石油炼制研究所便先后进行了常减压蒸馏离心分离、溶剂稀释沉淀和蒸馏焦化四种简易加工方法的试验，其中前三种已经获得完全成功，第四种还在继续试验。
    这些加工方法操作都很简单，所需的设备大部分地方机械厂都能供应。离心分离法没有离心机用牛奶分离器也能代替。常减压蒸馏法所需的釜，用普通钢板就能制造。因此，这些简易加工法即使县乡甚至合作社办的小型炼油厂，也都可以广泛采用。
