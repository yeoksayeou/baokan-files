　　Intercropping Green Manure: Expanding Fertilizer Sources
    Anhui and Shandong Expand Green Manure Planting Area

    (This report) The area of green manure crops planted in Anhui Province has been continuously expanding in recent years. In 1954, the province only had 2.5 million mu of green manure. This year, it has increased to more than 8 million mu. Currently, various localities are carrying out seed retention and protection work, planning to expand the green manure area to more than 30 million mu next year. Completing this plan next year can basically solve the base fertilizer for about one-third of the cultivated land in the province.

    Large-scale intercropping of green manure is an important experience in planting green manure in Anhui Province in recent years. Intercropping green manure before planting medium rice and in fields of sorghum, corn, etc., not only does not occupy cultivated land, but also can increase soil organic matter, improve soil aggregate structure, and save labor for fertilizer application. Intercropping green manure is also not restricted by the season and can be intercropped all year round. At the same time, the cost is very low, with only a few jiao needed per mu for intercropping. Of the more than 30 million mu of green manure planned to be planted next year, intercropping accounts for 15 million to 20 million mu.

    The widespread promotion of chopping green manure and retting fertilizer is also a major feature of fertilizer accumulation work in Anhui Province. Now is the season when grasses and trees are flourishing, and farmers in mountainous and polder areas are cutting mountain grass and lake grass to retting green manure. In the past, there was very little retting fertilizer in the Huaibei area, but this year there has been new development. Bengbu Special District plans to dig a field head cellar for every five mu of land in the entire district this year to greatly retting green manure.

    (This report) The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a notice on May 24 on vigorously promoting the planting of green manure crops. The notice pointed out: Intercropping green manure crops in the late growth stage of various early autumn crops, and plowing them into the soil as base fertilizer for autumn planting when they grow to the initial flowering stage, is an important measure to develop fertilizer sources, improve soil, and ensure increased production. According to the experience of Anhui Province, intercropping mung beans between crops such as sorghum, and turning the mung beans into the ground as base fertilizer for wheat after the sorghum is harvested, can increase production by 32.6% under the same conditions. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that the experience of planting green manure crops as base fertilizer be vigorously promoted this year. The preliminary plan is to intercrop green manure crops on 20 million mu of large autumn crop land throughout the province.

### 套种绿肥　开拓肥源  安徽山东扩大绿肥种植面积

　　套种绿肥　开拓肥源
    安徽山东扩大绿肥种植面积
    本报讯  安徽省种植绿肥作物的面积几年来不断扩大，1954年全省只有绿肥二百五十万亩，今年已增加到八百多万亩，目前各地正进行留种保种工作，计划把明年绿肥面积扩大到三千多万亩。明年完成这一计划可基本上解决全省三分之一左右的耕地基肥。
    大面积套种绿肥，是安徽省几年来种植绿肥一个重要经验。在中稻栽种前和高粱玉米等地里套种绿肥，既不占用耕地，又可以增加土壤有机质、改善土壤团粒结构，可以省去用肥的人力。套种绿肥还不受季节限制，一年四季都可套种。同时，成本也很低，套种一亩只需几角钱。明年计划种植的三千多万亩绿肥，其中套种有一千五百万亩到二千万亩。
    普遍推广打青沤肥，也是安徽省积肥工作中的一大特点。现在正是草木繁茂的季节，山区、圩区农民正在割山草，打湖草沤制绿肥。过去淮北地区沤肥很少，今年也有了新的发展。蚌埠专区今年计划全区每五亩地就挖一个地头窖大大沤制绿肥。
    本报讯  山东省农业厅5月24日发出了关于大力推广种植绿肥作物的通知。通知指出：在各种早秋作物生长后期套种绿肥作物，在生长到初花时期耕翻作秋种基肥，是开拓肥源、改良土壤、保证增产的一项重要措施。据安徽省经验，在高粱等作物间套种绿豆，待高粱收获后把绿豆翻到地里作小麦基肥，同样条件下可增产32.6％。因此，中共山东省委要求今年要大力推广种植绿肥作物作基肥的经验。初步计划在全省大秋作物地套种绿肥作物二千万亩。
