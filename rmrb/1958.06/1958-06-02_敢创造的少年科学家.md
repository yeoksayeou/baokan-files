Young Scientists Who Dare to Create

    This newspaper reports: The Miqiulin (Michurin) group of Jiaokou Elementary School in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, which participated in the National Children's Science and Technology Craftwork Exhibition in 1955 with a sunflower the size of a broad bean and was praised by Premier Zhou, has new creations this year. In their experimental garden, they have cultivated multi-spike wheat with fourteen ears on one stalk, and branching barley with sixty-four branches grown from one barley seed.

    In the past few years, these daring and creative children have also cultivated corn with thirteen ears on one stalk, giant bamboo shoots weighing twenty-four catties, and large sweet potatoes weighing forty catties, as well as more than ten kinds of various fruits in the experimental garden.

    Now, the children have formulated a small five-year plan. They will continue to work hard on research, and in the future, they want rice to also have multiple ears, and corn to grow sixty ears on one stalk like bananas.

    敢创造的少年科学家
    本报讯　1955年以蚕豆大的向日葵参加全国少年儿童科学技术工艺作品展览会，受到周总理表扬的浙江省于潜县交口小学米丘林小组，今年又有新的创造。在他们的实验园地里培植出一根茎秆上长十四个穗的多穗小麦，和一粒大麦种子长出六十四根枝条的分枎大麦。
    几年来，这些敢想、敢创造的孩子们，在实验园地里还培养了一秆长十三个穗的玉米，二十四斤重的大笋瓜，一棵长四十斤重的大甘薯，各色各样的水果十多种。
    现在，孩子们已经订出了小五年计划。他们要继续努力研究，将来要让水稻也多穗，叫玉米像香蕉一样一秆长出六十个穗。
