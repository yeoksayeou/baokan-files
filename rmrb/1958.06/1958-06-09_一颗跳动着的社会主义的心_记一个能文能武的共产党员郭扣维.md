　　A Pulsating Socialist Heart
　　——Remembering Guo Kouwei, a Communist Party Member Skilled in Both Literary and Military Pursuits
　　By Our Reporters Shui Tiansheng and Fan Yinhuai
　　In Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, there is a forty-eight-year-old farmer and Communist Party member named Guo Kouwei. He is skilled in both literary and military pursuits, able to write and sing.
　　Guo Kouwei is the propaganda committee member of the Dazhong Han Village Party branch. When he carried out cultural propaganda work in the village, difficulties followed one after another. There were no gongs and drums, no backbone for cultural activities, and no propaganda materials. But Guo Kouwei had plenty of confidence and strength. He hollowed out wood to make a makeshift drum, which still made a loud bang when struck; he wrote his own propaganda materials. When he taught a few children to sing and perform, the children's parents were unhappy and didn't want their children to learn to sing with Guo Kouwei.
　　Once, Guo Kouwei and his family of three went to Mengxiannao Village to sing and perform. His younger aunt said, "How can you twist and turn at your age!" The more she said it, the more happily Guo Kouwei twisted and the higher he sang. Li Yumin, a farmer from Qianda Han Village, advised him, "If you want to perform, it would be better to have someone else accompany you. How can you perform with your own daughter?" Guo Kouwei ignored him and continued to perform.
　　The masses welcomed his singing and performance. People with children said, "Guo Kouwei's family of three go from street to street singing and performing, bringing joy and education to everyone. We should be more open-minded and let our children participate in singing and performing." Young people couldn't wait for their parents to say these words and eagerly participated in cultural activities. In this way, Guo Kouwei developed propagandists in five small mountain villages, forming a propaganda network.
　　Last year, there was a drought, and agricultural cooperatives reduced production. Some cooperative members became impatient. Some even said, "Joining the agricultural cooperative is not as good as working individually." Guo Kouwei heard these words. He knew that some cooperative members were not only panicked in the face of difficulties but, more importantly, capitalist ideology was rising. In addition to immediately mobilizing the masses for propaganda, Guo Kouwei himself wrote a clapper talk and sang it everywhere: "Last year, we turned to advanced cooperatives, the benefits of advanced cooperatives are endless; although we suffered disaster and reduced production, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations are catching up. In the old society, when disasters struck, we sold our children, now when disasters strike, we add to our possessions, buying pigs, buying sheep, and buying mules, building dams and reclaiming land to build terraces. Without advanced cooperatives, it would be difficult to improve production."
　　The clapper talk spread throughout the village. People talked about it at mealtimes; one said, "If it weren't for the advanced cooperative, we poor young men would have had to sell our children when disaster struck!" Another said, "Working individually is a dead end, cooperation is the path to survival."
　　A great debate began: should we take the capitalist road or the socialist road? The struggle between the two roads unfolded in Dazhong Han Village. The emancipated farmer Fang Xiaowu said that cooperation was bad in this way and bad in that way. Guo Kouwei couldn't sleep for several nights after hearing these words. The bitter days of the old society flashed before his eyes again, when he sold his daughter to others for a few pecks of grain with tears in his eyes. After liberation, the bitter days finally came to an end, and he and the masses fought against the landlords and were allocated land. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, he understood the truth and became a Communist Party member. He was deeply saddened to see that some people had forgotten the pain once the wound had healed! But being sad was not enough, he had to come up with a solution. The next day, Guo Kouwei brought out all his belongings from the old society: a basket filled with worn-out clothes, rags, pots, and bowls; and displayed all the clothes, shoes, socks, new cotton quilts, farm tools, and other utensils that filled several large boxes after liberation, along with a chart showing his rising standard of living year by year. He also wrote a clapper talk called "There Was Much Suffering in the Old Society" to sing to the masses.
　　The exhibition and singing educated the people. Guo Kouwei's different experiences in the old and new societies were vividly displayed before the people, and many shed tears. Fang Xiaowu said, "Guo Kouwei's exhibition is like a knife stuck in my heart. Without the new society, without cooperation, there would be no Fang Xiaowu."
　　Guo Kouwei was originally a farmer who didn't understand culture, but because he dared to think and act and studied culture diligently, he finally opened up a cultural propaganda front in a remote and backward village. In recent years, he has written more than two hundred singing and performance materials, becoming a well-known cultural figure in the village. And in agricultural production, he is an excellent production team leader and a production expert.

　　一颗跳动着的社会主义的心
    ——记一个能文能武的共产党员郭扣维
    本报记者　水天生　范银怀
    在山西省昔阳县，有一个四十八岁的农民、共产党员郭扣维。他能文能武，会写会唱。
    郭扣维是大中寒村党支部的宣传委员。他在村里开展文化宣传工作时，困难接踵而至。没有锣鼓，没有文化活动的骨干，没有宣传材料。但郭扣维有的是：信心和力量。他把木头掏空顶边鼓，敲起来照样梆梆响；自己编写宣传材料。他教几个小孩说唱时，小孩的父母亲不高兴，不让他们的孩子跟郭扣维学唱。
    有一次，郭扣维一家三口人到孟先堖村说唱，他的小姨说：“你那么大的年纪咋个能扭出来！”她越说，郭扣维越是扭的欢，唱的高。前大寒村农民李玉民劝他说：“你要演可以，配个旁人也好些，怎么跟自己的女儿一起演戏呢？”郭扣维却不理他这一套，照样演下去。
    群众倒底是欢迎他说唱的。有儿女的人说：“郭扣维一家三口人串街说唱，使大家欢乐，受到教育，咱们也得想开些，让儿女参加说唱。”年青人巴不得爹妈说这句话，纷纷参加文化活动。就这样，郭扣维又在五个小山庄分别发展了宣传员，形成了一个宣传网。
    去年天旱，农业社减了产。有些社员沉不住气了。个别社员甚至说“参加农业社不如单干好。”这话被郭扣维听见了。他知道，有些社员不只是在困难面前惊慌失措，更主要的是资本主义思想抬头了。郭扣维除了立即发动群众进行宣传外，自己还编了一首快板到处说唱：“去年转了高级社，高级社的好处说不完；虽然遭灾减了产，林牧副业往回赶。旧社会遭灾卖儿女，现在遭灾往回添，买猪买羊又买骡，闸沟开滩修梯田，如果没有高级社，生产提高难上难。”
    快板传遍了全村。人们在饭场上纷纷言讲；这个说，“如果不是高级社，遭了灾，咱这伙穷小子，早就该卖儿女啦！”那个说：“单干是死路，合作化是活路。”
    大辩论开始了，走资本主义的路，还是走社会主义的路？两条道路的斗争在大中寒村展开。翻身农民方小五说合作化这个不好，那个不好。郭扣维听到这些话，好几宵睡不着。旧社会的苦日子又闪在他的眼前，他含着眼泪把女儿卖给人家，换了几斗粮食。解放后，苦日子总算熬到了头，他和群众在一起斗倒了地主，分到了土地。在党的教育和培养下，他懂得了真理，成了一个共产党员。他看到如今有些人好了伤疤忘了痛，他的心里多么难受啊！但光难受不行，要拿出办法来。郭扣维第二天就把自己在旧社会的全部家当：一筐篮装不满的烂衣服、破絮、锅、碗拿出来；把解放后的装几大箱也装不完的衣服、鞋袜、新棉被、农具等用具一同展出来，同时把自己生活逐年上升的情况画成图表。他还编写“旧社会苦处多”的快板给群众说唱。
    展览会和说唱教育了人们。郭扣维新旧社会的不同经历活生生地展现在人们的眼前，不少人流泪了。方小五说：“郭扣维展览会像刀子一样扎在我的心里。没有新社会，没有合作化，也就没有我方小五。”
    郭扣维原先也是一个不懂文化的农民，但由于他敢想敢做，刻苦钻研文化，终于在偏僻落后的村庄开拓了文化宣传阵地。几年来，他编写了二百多个说唱材料，成为全村有名的文化人。而在农业生产中，他是一个优秀的生产队长，一个生产能手。
