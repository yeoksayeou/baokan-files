Spring Crops are not "Lazy Crops"
Yunnan Deploys Next Year's Spring Production Work in Advance

(Our report) Yunnan Province has started preparations for next year's spring production early this year, striving for a great leap forward in spring production.

Yunnan Province reaped a bumper harvest this spring. Spring grain production is expected to increase by 22.2%, and rapeseed production is expected to increase by 37.8%. However, the average yield of spring grain in the province is only more than 130 catties per mu, and the spring multiple cropping index has reached 137%. This is not commensurate with the province's superior conditions of short frost period, long sunshine hours, and suitability for overwintering spring crops in most areas. This also shows that Yunnan's spring production has great potential. To this end, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee required all localities to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results to carry out a great revolution and great leap forward in spring production. Not long ago, when the province was in the midst of an upsurge of drought resistance and transplanting of summer crops, the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial spring production conference in Chengjiang County in the form of an on-site meeting. This conference, in the spirit of breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, combining the virtual with the real, and integrating redness and expertise, solved the right-leaning conservative ideas that spring crops are "lazy crops," "unofficial crops," "delaying summer crops is a year's loss, delaying spring crops is only a season's loss," and that spring production cannot make a great leap forward; it visited and exchanged typical experiences such as 800 catties of broad beans per mu in Chengjiang County, 500 catties of rapeseed per mu in Jiangchuan County, and 500 catties of wheat per mu in Chenggong County; formulated a preliminary plan for the province's 1959 spring leap forward; and arranged and deployed various specific measures to ensure increased spring production next year, including water conservancy, fertilizer, selection of improved varieties, intensive cultivation and careful farming, rational close planting, prevention of diseases and pests, expansion of multiple cropping areas, and changes in farming systems. After the meeting, all localities have begun to prepare for next year's spring production, put forward preliminary plans for next year's spring leap forward, and carried out publicity among the masses. The Qujing County Party Committee also put forward three requirements: First, start immediately to reserve enough spring seeds; second, store 60 million cubic meters of water this autumn, striving to reach 100 million cubic meters to ensure spring irrigation; and third, work hard in July and August to accumulate fertilizer, reaching 500 loads per mu.

### 小春不是“懒庄稼”  云南提前布置明年小春生产工作

　　小春不是“懒庄稼”
    云南提前布置明年小春生产工作
    本报讯  云南省今年提早动手进行明年小春生产的准备工作，争取小春生产也来个大跃进。
    云南省今年小春获得丰收，小春粮食可增产22.2％，油菜籽可增产37.8％。但是全省小春粮食平均单产只有一百三十多斤，小春复种面积共达137％。这和全省大部分地区霜期短、日照长、适于小春作物越冬生长的优越条件不相适应。这也说明云南小春有巨大潜力。为此，中共云南省委要求各地在小春生产上必须贯彻多快好省的方针来个大革命、大跃进。不久前，正当全省处于大春作物抗旱栽插高潮时，省委农村工作部就在澄江县用现场会议形式召开了全省小春生产会议。这次会议本着破除迷信，解放思想，虚实并举，红专结合的精神，解决了认为小春是“懒庄稼”、“非正式庄稼”、“耽误大春是一年，耽误小春只一季”，以及认为小春生产不能大跃进等右倾保守思想；参观和交流了澄江县亩产八百斤蚕豆、江川县亩产五百斤油菜、呈贡县亩产五百斤小麦等典型经验；制定了1959年全省小春跃进初步规划；安排与布置了保证明年小春增产的水利、肥料、选用良种、精耕细作、合理密植、防止病害、扩大复种面积、改变耕作制度等各项具体措施。会后各地都已开始动手抓明年小春生产的准备工作，提出明年小春跃进的初步规划，在群众中开展宣传。曲靖县委并提出三个要求：一、马上动手，留足小春籽种；二、今秋蓄水六千万方，争取达到一亿方，保证小春灌溉；三，7、8两月苦战积肥，达到每亩五百挑。  （陈渭庚）
