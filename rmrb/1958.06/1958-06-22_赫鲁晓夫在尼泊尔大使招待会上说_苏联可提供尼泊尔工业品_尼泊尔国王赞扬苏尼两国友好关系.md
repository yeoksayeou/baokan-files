Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 21st: According to TASS, the Nepalese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Manandar, entrusted by the King of Nepal, Mahendra, who is visiting the Soviet Union, held a reception in Moscow on the evening of the 20th.

The leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, and others were invited to attend the reception. The King attended the reception with his wife, their entourage, and foreign diplomats.

At the reception, King Mahendra of Nepal and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev spoke successively.

King Mahendra of Nepal said that in the two years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Nepal and the Soviet Union, the friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries have been very satisfactory. He expressed his belief that his visit to the Soviet Union will help to further strengthen the relations between the two countries.

The King of Nepal praised the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in all aspects. On behalf of the Nepalese people, he congratulated the Soviet leaders and people on their achievements. He also expressed his belief that the Soviet people and government will certainly continue to work for world peace, international trust, and cooperation.

In his speech, Khrushchev said that we are very satisfied that our two countries have established cooperative and friendly relations, and we believe that this relationship will develop smoothly. Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union can provide Nepal with industrial products. Nepal's agricultural products and other products will also be useful to the Soviet Union. We are willing to make every necessary effort to develop and consolidate the friendly economic and cultural ties between our two countries.

Khrushchev then spoke about the characteristics of the current situation, saying that every effort must be made to ensure that science serves entirely the welfare of the people and the happiness of mankind, rather than being used to eliminate people and destroy material wealth.

Khrushchev emphasized that everything the Soviet Union and the Soviet people have done in the past and are doing now is precisely for the peaceful development of relations between countries. The Soviet Union has put forward many peace proposals to Western countries, and if Western countries accept these proposals, it would lead to disarmament and a halt to the arms race, and it would make nuclear weapons illegal.

The King of Nepal returned to Moscow on the 20th after visiting various parts of the Soviet Union. He recently visited Kiev, Stalingrad, Yerevan, and other cities in the Soviet Union.

    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：尼泊尔驻苏联大使马南达尔受在苏联访问的尼泊尔国王马亨德拉的委托，20日晚上在莫斯科举行了招待会。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫等人应邀出席了招待会。同国王一起出席招待会的有他的夫人、他们的随员以及外国的外交使节。
    在招待会上，尼泊尔国王马亨德拉和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫先后讲了话。
    尼泊尔国王马亨德拉说，尼泊尔和苏联建立外交关系两年来，两国之间的友好和互相了解一直是十分令人满意的。他表示相信，他这次访问苏联将有助于使两国的关系进一步加强。
    尼泊尔国王赞扬了苏联人民在各方面所取得的辉煌成就。他以尼泊尔人民的名义祝贺苏联领导人和人民取得这种成就。他同时表示相信，苏联人民和政府将一定继续为争取世界和平、国际信任和合作而努力。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中说，我们很满意，我们两国建立了合作和友好的关系，相信这种关系将会顺利地发展。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联可以向尼泊尔提供工业品。尼泊尔生产的农产品和其他制品对苏联也会有用处。我们愿意尽一切必要的努力，使我们两国间的友好的经济和文化联系得到发展和巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到当前局势的特点，他说，必须尽一切努力，使科学完全为人们的福利、为人类的幸福服务，而不是用它来消灭人和破坏物质财富。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联和苏联人民过去和现在所做的一切都正是为了和平地发展各国之间的关系。苏联向西方国家提出了很多和平建议，如果西方国家接受这些建议，那就会导致裁军和停止军备竞赛，那就会使核武器成为不合法。
