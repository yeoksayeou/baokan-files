Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 9th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is using domestically produced "An-2" aircraft for the first time this year to control locusts on the grasslands of the Barkol and Hejing pastoral areas.

Barkol and Hejing are both regions primarily engaged in animal husbandry, with large grassland areas. In the past, because aircraft locust control was mainly carried out in agricultural areas, pastoral areas were not covered. As a result, locusts often occurred in large numbers on the grasslands, devouring a large amount of pasture, which affected the grazing of livestock. To protect the pasture, these two regions decided to use aircraft to control locusts on 260,000 mu of grassland this year.

The temporary airport on the Barkol grassland has been repaired, and 150 tons of "666" insecticide powder for locust control has been transported to the grassland, and the aircraft have already been dispatched. Locust control work in Hejing will also begin in late June.

    新疆用“安二”型飞机为牧区治蝗
    新华社乌鲁木齐9日电　新疆维吾尔自治区今年第一次使用国产“安二”型飞机，在巴里坤、和靖牧区草原上防治蝗虫。
    巴里坤、和靖都是以畜牧业为主的地区，草原面积很大。过去由于飞机治蝗主要在农区，牧区没有进行，所以草场上常有大量蝗虫发生，很多牧草被吃掉，影响了牲畜的牧放。为了保护牧场，今年这两个地区决定在二十六万亩草原上使用飞机治蝗。
    巴里坤草原上的临时机场已经修理完毕，治蝗用的一百五十吨“六六六”药粉已运到草原上，飞机已经出动。和靖的治蝗工作在6月下旬也将开始。
