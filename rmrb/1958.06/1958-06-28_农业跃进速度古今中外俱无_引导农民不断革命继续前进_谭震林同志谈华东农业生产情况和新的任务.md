Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th: Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his summary at the East China Agricultural Cooperation Conference on the 25th: Based on the situation in Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shanghai, agricultural production is very promising. The task of averaging 2,000 jin of grain per person can be completed within three to five years.

He said that the four provinces and one city are increasing grain production this year at a leaping pace of 70%. The total grain output of these provinces and cities in 1957 was 71.5 billion jin. The summer grain output in 1958 has reached 20.3 billion jin. It is estimated that the autumn grain output can reach 102 billion jin, with a total annual output of more than 120 billion jin. This year, the goal of averaging 1,000 jin of grain per person can be achieved. From this, it can be seen that the task of averaging 2,000 jin of grain per person can be completed in less than five years. Cotton and oil crops are also growing as rapidly as grain. It is estimated that by 1959, the output of ginned cotton and oil crops will double or triple that of 1957. He said that such a high-speed leap forward is unprecedented in history. This is the victory of the general line of socialist construction, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. The argument that Marxism-Leninism cannot produce grain has been refuted. Marxism-Leninism can produce grain.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin then pointed out that the summer grain has already been harvested, but the output of autumn crops is still only an estimate. From estimate to realization, a great deal of effort is still needed. He called on all regions to first ensure the completion of the summer planting plan. Even if there is no rain, the plan must be realized. Without planting, there is no harvest to speak of. The second is to strengthen field management to ensure a bumper harvest in autumn, first the bumper harvest of early rice, followed by the bumper harvest of mid-season rice, late rice, cotton, oil crops, sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, millet, and other crops. We must strive for an all-round bumper harvest, so that all kinds of crops have "satellites" launched into the sky and "marshals" promoted. Third, conscientiously promote improved tools and new-style animal-powered farm implements, and strive to eliminate backward farm implements within the year, ensuring that labor efficiency is increased by more than two times. He said that this is a key to ensuring a bumper harvest, a basic measure for regulating work and rest, and a material foundation for consolidating and prospering morale. Any underestimation or neglect of this work is a manifestation of a weak mass viewpoint.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin said that doubling the summer harvest next year is the key to completing the grain and oil plan for next year. We must seize the time to prepare for autumn planting. The more complete and adequate the preparation, the more guaranteed the bumper harvest. He asked all regions to immediately check the preparation of autumn planting seeds, fertilizers, tools, and stubble arrangements at the end of the summer harvest. He also requested that the field management work after autumn planting be strict, diligent, and meticulous. He said that as long as these tasks are done well, the phenomenon of 1,000 jin per mu next year will not be a minority, and 1,000 jin per county will not be individual. "Satellites" with even greater weight will surely rise into the sky.

He reminded all regions that the agricultural capital construction this winter and next spring will be even larger than last winter and this spring: we must continue to build large-scale water conservancy projects, accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, and also deeply plow the land and improve the soil. At the same time, winter production tasks will also increase compared to last winter. For example, the field management of overwintering crops, the cultivation of various cash crops, and the development of diversified economies, which were not given much attention in the past, must now be managed. Therefore, the inevitable result is a great shortage of labor. Based on this situation, Comrade Tan Zhenlin asked all regions to make various preparations in advance, especially to vigorously grasp the work of reforming and promoting tools. He said that only by improving efficiency through the reform of tools can we overfulfill production tasks.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out that a comprehensive bumper harvest and great excitement in people's hearts will naturally generate new demands and new hopes. We should appropriately meet the demands of the masses and guide them to work hard to realize their new hopes. He said that the new demands refer to the masses' demands for improving their lives, which should be appropriately met along with the development of production. The new hope is that farmers yearn for mechanization and electrification. We must guide the masses to move in this direction. He demanded that all agricultural cooperatives have a machine this winter and next spring. He said that the sound of machines rumbling every day can open up the horizons of farmers, help them liberate their minds, and know the benefits of industrialization. When farmers have hope for industry, they will be guided to strive for new hopes, and our work must also work towards this direction, so that industry will develop faster under such pressure. He said that this is the foundation of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out: The so-called "hard work for three years to change the face of most areas in our country" is not only a change in the natural face, but also a change including the spiritual and material face, a change in industry and agriculture, culture, education, transportation.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin finally encouraged everyone: Comrades, Chairman Mao proposed "hard work for three years," and only half a year has passed! We must continue to grasp all work tightly and not relax.

    农业跃进速度古今中外俱无
    引导农民不断革命继续前进
    谭震林同志谈华东农业生产情况和新的任务
    新华社合肥27日电　中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志，25日在华东区农业协作会议上作总结说：根据安徽、江苏、浙江、福建和上海的情况看来，农业生产大有希望，平均每人二千斤粮食的任务，三年到五年内即可完成。
    他说，四省一市今年粮食增产是以70％的速度飞跃前进的。这些省市的粮食总产量1957年共七百一十五亿斤，1958年夏季粮食产量已达到二百零三亿斤，预计秋季粮食产量可达到一千零二十亿斤，全年总产量一千二百多亿斤，今年就可达到每人平均千斤粮的目标了。由此可以看出，每人平均二千斤粮食的任务，不需要五年即可完成。棉花和油料也和粮食一样的迅速增长，预计到1959年，皮棉和油料的产量，都要比1957年翻一翻到两翻。他说，这样高速度的跃进，是古今中外都没有过的。这是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，这是马克思列宁主义的胜利。认为马列主义不能出粮食的论调被驳倒了，马列主义是能出粮食的。
    谭震林同志接着指出，今年夏粮已收到手，但秋季的作物产量还只是一个预计，由预计到实现，尚须作很大的努力。他号召各地首先要保证夏种计划的完成，即使无雨也要实现计划，不种下，就谈不到收。第二是加强田间管理，保证秋季大丰收，首先是早稻的丰收，接着是中稻、晚稻、棉花、油料、红芋、玉米、高粱、谷子等等作物的丰收。要争取全面大丰收，作到各种作物都有“卫星”上天，都有“元帅升帐”。第三，认真推广改良工具和新式畜力农具，力争在年内消灭落后农具，保证劳动效率提高两倍以上。他说，这是保证丰收的一个关键，是调剂劳逸的基本措施，也是巩固兴旺的士气的一个物质基础。对这一工作的任何轻视和疏忽，都是群众观点不强的表现。
    谭震林同志说，明年夏收再翻一翻，是完成明年粮、油规划的关键，必须抓紧秋种前的准备工作。准备得愈完善愈充分，丰收就愈有保证。他要求各地在夏收结束时，立即检查一下秋种种籽、肥料、工具及茬口安排等准备工作的情况。他并要求在秋种后的田间管理工作，要严要勤要细。他说，只要作好这些工作，明年千斤亩将不是少数现象，千斤县将不是个别的，重量更大的“卫星”，必然会升上天空。
    他提醒各地，今冬明春的农业基本建设，将比去冬今春更大：要继续大兴水利，要大量积肥，还要深翻土地，改良土壤。同时冬季生产任务也会比去冬增加。如越冬作物的田间管理，各种经济作物的培育，以及发展多种经济等等，过去不大管的事，现在都要管起来了。因此，随之而来的必然是劳动力的大感缺乏。谭震林同志根据这种情况，要求各地从现在起，就要提早做好各种准备，特别要大力抓紧改革和推广工具的工作。他说，只有通过改革工具提高了效率，才能超额完成生产任务。
    谭震林同志指出，全面大丰收，人心大兴奋，自然会产生新的要求和新的希望，我们应适当满足群众的要求，引导群众努力奋斗，实现自己的新的希望。他说，新的要求就是指群众对改善生活的要求，应随着生产的发展，适当给以满足。新的希望，就是农民向往机械化和电气化。我们必须引导群众向这个方向迈进。他要求今冬明春所有农业社都要有一部机器。他说，机器每天冬冬冬地响，这就可以打开农民的眼界，帮助他们解放思想，知道工业化的好处。农民对工业有了希望，就会引导农民为新的希望奋斗，我们的工作也要向这方面努力，工业被这样一逼，也就发展得更快了。他说，这就是技术革命和文化革命的基础。谭震林同志指出：所谓“苦战三年，在我国绝大部分地区改变面貌”，不仅是自然面貌的改变，而且是包括精神、物质面貌的改变，是工农、文教、交通运输都改变。
    谭震林同志最后鼓舞大家说：同志们，毛主席提出“苦战三年”，现在才只过了半年啊！我们必须继续对各项工作抓得紧紧的，不要放松。
