Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 25th - Bulgarian newspapers published editorials on the 25th, further exposing the role played by Tito's revisionist clique in the anti-Soviet and anti-socialist propaganda movement organized by Western imperialists, regarding the attitude expressed by the Yugoslav revisionist group after the Hungarian government announced the verdict on the Nagy counter-revolutionary group. The "Workers' Cause" editorial pointed out that, both during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion and now, Yugoslav newspapers have carried out appalling slanders against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as their peaceful diplomatic policies. After the news of Nagy's verdict was published, Yugoslav newspapers surprisingly printed Nagy's photo and hastily echoed the reactionary clamor of the West, attempting to justify their shameful role in the Hungarian incident and fanatically praising the activities of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary bandits. The so-called "socialist" newspapers in Yugoslavia are no different from the notorious bourgeois newspapers.

The editorial said that it was not just Yugoslav newspapers that participated in this shameful collusion. The official spokesperson of the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs also hastily adopted this position, futilely attempting to deny the close ties established between Nagy and the South Communist leadership group. Not only that, but Yugoslavia also lodged a protest note with the Hungarian government regarding the Nagy group's verdict.

The editorial said that the true face of modern revisionism and its historical responsibility for the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident are now clearer than ever. Can history forgive the Yugoslav revisionists for this responsibility?

The "People's Youth News" editorial pointed out that Yugoslav revisionists are now shedding more tears for the traitors of the Hungarian people than the imperialists. After "Borba" published the news of Nagy's verdict, it also published Nagy's biography. The newspaper tried hard to emphasize Nagy's "achievements" for the working class. They also rushed to cite a London commentary in "Borba" saying that the execution of Nagy was a "shameless provocative action against Yugoslavia." Obviously, on this issue, the Yugoslav leaders are also acting according to the dictates of the imperialists. The purpose of Yugoslavia's recent protest note to the Hungarian government is clearly to help the so-called United Nations Special Committee on the Hungarian Question attempt to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs once again.

The "Agricultural Banner" editorial said that it is worth pondering that in the movement to oppose us, modern revisionists also echo the bankers in Washington and London, and the clericalists in Rome and Brussels. Just when all progressive public opinion, communist parties and workers' parties around the world condemned Nagy's criminal activities, Belgrade newspapers defended this traitor of the Hungarian people. When the imperialists slander socialist countries, Belgrade newspapers not only repeat their slanders, but even sing a tune higher than them. Doesn't all this prove once again the responsibility of the South Communist leaders for the Hungarian bloody incident?

    保加利亚各报发表社论指出
    南共修正主义者为纳吉哭丧
    更加证明南共应对匈牙利流血事件负责
    新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚各报25日分别发表社论，就铁托修正主义集团在匈牙利政府宣布判决纳吉反革命集团后所表示的态度，进一步揭露南共修正主义者在西方帝国主义者所组织的反苏、反社会主义的宣传运动中所充当的角色。“工人事业报”的社论指出，无论是在匈牙利反革命叛乱期间和现在，南斯拉夫报刊都对苏联和其他社会主义国家以及他们的和平外交政策进行了骇人听闻的污蔑。南斯拉夫报纸在纳吉被判决的消息发表后，竟然刊登纳吉的照片，并急忙反映西方的反动叫嚣，力图为自己在匈牙利事件中充当可耻角色辩解以及狂热地颂扬匈牙利反革命匪帮的活动。南斯拉夫所谓“社会主义”的报纸同臭名远扬的资产阶级报刊毫无差别。
    社论说，不只是南斯拉夫的报刊参加了这个可耻的勾当。南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的官方发言人也匆匆忙忙地采取了这种立场，他徒劳无益地企图抵赖纳吉同南共领导集团所建立的密切联系。不但如此，南斯拉夫方面还就纳吉集团的判决向匈牙利政府提出了抗议照会。
    社论说，现代修正主义的真面目和它对匈牙利反革命事件所负的历史责任现在比任何时候都暴露得更清楚。历史能够宽恕南斯拉夫修正主义者的这个责任么？
    “人民青年报”的社论指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者现在为匈牙利人民的叛徒流的眼泪比帝国主义者还要多。在“战斗报”刊登了判决纳吉的消息以后，又刊登了纳吉的传略。报纸竭力强调纳吉对工人阶级的“功绩”。他们还赶忙在“战斗报”上引证伦敦的评论说，处决纳吉是“对南斯拉夫的无耻挑衅行动”。很明显，在这个问题上南斯拉夫领导人也是看帝国主义者的脸色行事的。南斯拉夫最近给匈牙利政府的一项抗议照会的目的，很明显是为了帮助所谓联合国匈牙利问题特别委员会企图对匈牙利内政再度进行干涉。
    “农业旗帜报”的社论说，值得玩味的是，在反对我们的叫嚣运动中，现代修正主义者也同华盛顿和伦敦的银行家们，同罗马和布鲁塞尔的教权派们同声呼应了。正当全世界一切进步舆论、共产党和工人党谴责纳吉的罪恶活动的时候，贝尔格莱德的报纸却替匈牙利人民的这个叛徒辩护。当帝国主义者污蔑社会主义国家时，贝尔格莱德的报纸不仅重复他们的污蔑，甚至唱的调子比他们还要高。所有这一切不是再一次证明了南共领导人对匈牙利流血事件所负的责任吗？
