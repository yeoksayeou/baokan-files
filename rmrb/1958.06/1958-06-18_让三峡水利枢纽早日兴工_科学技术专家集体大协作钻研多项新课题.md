Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 17th. The Yangtze River Three Gorges Hydropower Project Scientific and Technological Research Conference was held in Wuhan from June 5th to 16th. This was a conference to liberate thought, break down superstitions, and strive for advancement; a conference that linked theory with practice to promote a great leap forward in science and technology; and also a conference for collective collaboration among relevant scientific and technological circles nationwide.

More than 260 scientific and technical experts and responsible personnel from 82 units across the country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, used emptiness to drive reality, promoted the spirit of breaking down superstitions, breaking conventions, and striving for advancement, and discussed and drafted more than 250 scientific and technological problems that needed to be studied. These problems involve many disciplines such as geology, hydrology, machinery, electrical engineering, civil engineering, mechanics, metallurgy, electronics, automatic control and remote operation, economics, geography, meteorology, seismology, agricultural science, and archaeology.

Due to the enormous scale and complexity of the Three Gorges Hydropower Project, many scientific and technological problems are yet to be solved in the world today. The scientific and technical workers participating in the conference put forward many new research topics. For example, electrical engineering experts are preparing to research and design hydro-generator units of 400,000 kilowatts, 600,000 kilowatts, and even larger. Power engineers proposed to study 500,000 to 600,000-volt high-voltage transmission technology, and some even proposed to study DC transmission. Mechanical experts proposed to study cranes that can lift 2,000 tons, which is twice the capacity of the world's largest crane. The Three Gorges has a particularly large flow and extremely high drop, and the dam gates need to withstand enormous water pressure, which is also a difficult problem that has not been encountered in water conservancy projects in various countries. A professor proposed to study changing the old-fashioned gate form and using a fish-shaped streamlined gate, like a stopper. A propeller is installed in front of this "fish" head, and an engine is installed in the belly of the fish. When the gate needs to be opened, the propeller is rotated, and the fish opens the gate hole, allowing water to pass through the hole. When it needs to be closed, the propeller is reversed to block the gate hole, which can solve the pressure problem. Hydraulic engineers proposed to use caisson cofferdams combined with dams. During rainstorms, the water volume changes in the Three Gorges area, which belongs to the subtropics, are greatly related. The problem of rainstorms is a problem that has not yet been solved in meteorology, and the problem of rainstorms in subtropical regions is particularly difficult. Meteorologists are preparing to overcome difficulties, study and solve this problem, and establish medium- and long-term weather forecasts to serve the Three Gorges Hydropower Project. The Three Gorges Hydropower Project needs to solve many complex mathematical problems related to differential equations and probability theory. The mathematicians participating in the conference immediately stated that they would contract all the mathematical problems.

The Chinese experts and responsible persons of relevant departments participating in the conference, after repeated discussions and debates during the twelve-day meeting, all believed that they had the confidence and certainty to solve this series of scientific and technological problems in the near future.

During the conference, all personnel went to the Three Gorges for on-site investigation. Elderly people in their fifties, like young people, braved the drizzle to crawl along the steep cliffs, observing the sinkholes in the limestone, and climbed over 200-meter-high mountains under the scorching sun, overlooking the entire dam area. During the voyage between Wuhan and the Three Gorges, they worked day and night in the dining rooms, bedrooms, and even on the decks of the ships, holding small group meetings. They often had no time to appreciate the beautiful scenery on both sides of the river because of the heated debates on scientific issues. Many people said that being able to do some work for the Three Gorges Hydropower Project is a great happiness in their lives.

This conference was presided over by Zhang Jingfu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Feng Zhongyun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and other responsible persons from relevant departments. Zhang Jingfu encouraged everyone at the meeting to break the mysterious concept of scientific research, break the "conditional theory" and "habit theory," rely on collective strength under the leadership of the Party, and work creatively and intensively to study and solve the scientific and technological problems of the Three Gorges Hydropower Project as soon as possible. Feng Zhongyun was full of confidence in the ability of Chinese scientists and technical experts to solve these complex and enormous scientific and technological problems. He said: The scientific and technological problems of the Three Gorges Hydropower Project are very profound and complex, and some difficulties will inevitably be encountered in the course of progress, but as long as we liberate our minds, put politics in command, and dare to think and dare to act under the leadership of the Party, any difficulties can be overcome, and Chairman Mao's verse "The Three Gorges will produce a lake" will definitely be realized.

Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. Lin Yishan, Director of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and Li Zhennan, Chief Engineer, respectively introduced the situation of the Yangtze River Basin and the Three Gorges Hydropower Project and put forward their opinions. More than ten Soviet experts who are helping with construction work in China also participated in the meeting and put forward brilliant insights.

The Chinese scientists and engineering technical experts participating in the conference all participated in this work with the attitude of masters and with great enthusiasm. The beginning of this large-scale scientific and technological research work is inseparable from the major victories on the political and ideological fronts and the all-round great leap forward in production and construction; it is also inseparable from the large amount of investigation, surveying, and data collection work carried out by Chinese and Soviet experts and technical personnel from the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office and other units over the past two years.

### 让三峡水利枢纽早日兴工  科学技术专家集体大协作钻研多项新课题

    让三峡水利枢纽早日兴工
    科学技术专家集体大协作钻研多项新课题
    新华社武汉17日电　长江三峡水利枢纽科学技术研究会议6月5日到16日在武汉举行。这是一次解放思想、破除迷信、力争上游的会议，是理论联系实际促进科学技术大跃进的会议，也是全国有关科学技术界集体大协作的会议。
    全国各地前来参加会议的八十二个单位的二百六十多个科学技术专家和负责人员，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，以虚带实，发扬了破除迷信、打破常规、力争上游的精神，讨论和拟订了需要研究的二百五十多项科学技术问题。这些问题牵涉到地质、水文、机械、电机、土木建筑、力学、冶金、电子学、自动控制和远距离操纵、经济、地理、气象、地震、农业科学和考古等许多学科。
    由于三峡水利枢纽工程的巨大和复杂，许多科学技术问题是现今世界上尚未解决的。参加会议的科学技术工作者提出了许多新的研究课题。例如电机专家们准备研究设计四十万瓩、六十万瓩甚至更大的水轮发电机组。动力学家们提出要研究五十万到六十万伏的高压输电技术，有人还提出要研究直流输电问题。机械专家提出要研究起重二千吨的起重机，比目前世界上最大的起重机的能力还大一倍。三峡的流量特别巨大，落差极高，水坝闸门需要承受巨大的水压，这也是各国水利工程中没有遇到过的困难问题。有位教授提出要研究改变老一套的闸门形式，改用鱼形的流线型闸门，等于一个塞子一样，在这个
  “鱼”头前面装置螺旋桨，鱼腹中装一架发动机，要启闸的时候，使螺旋桨转动，这条鱼就开出闸洞，水就可以从洞内通过；需要关闭的时候，就让螺旋桨倒转，堵塞闸洞，这样可以解决压力问题。水利工程师们提出用管柱围堰结合大坝的办法。暴雨时属于副热带的三峡地区的水量变化有很大关系。暴雨问题是气象学上还没有解决的问题，而副热带地区的暴雨问题尤其是一个难题。气象学家准备克服困难，研究解决这个问题，并且要建立中期、长期天气预报为三峡水利枢纽服务。三峡水利枢纽需要解决许多有关微分方程和概率论等方面复杂的数学问题，参加会议的数学家立即表示要把全部数学问题承包下来。
    参加会议的中国专家和有关部门负责人在十二天的会议中，经过反复讨论和辩论，都认为有信心、有把握在不远的时期内解决这一系列的科学技术问题。
    会议期间，全体人员都到三峡进行了实地勘察。五十多岁的老年人和青年人一样，冒着细雨在削壁上匍伏行进，察看石灰岩中的溶洞，顶着火伞攀登二百多公尺高的山峦，俯瞰坝区全貌。航行在武汉到三峡间的日子里，他们夜以继日地在轮船的饭厅、卧室以至甲板上开小组会。常常为了热烈辩论科学问题而无暇顾盼两岸美好风光。许多人表示能够为三峡水利枢纽做一点工作是一生极大的幸福。
    这次会议是由中国科学院副院长张劲夫和水利电力部副部长冯仲云和其他有关部门负责人主持的。张劲夫在会上勉励大家要打破科学研究的神秘观念，打破“条件论”和“习惯论”，在党的领导下，依靠集体力量，创造性地紧张劳动，把三峡水利枢纽的科学技术问题尽快的研究解决。冯仲云对中国科学家和技术专家解决这些复杂巨大的科学技术问题充满了信心。他说：三峡水利枢纽的科学技术问题是很高深复杂的，在前进途中一定会遇到一些困难，但只要解放思想、政治挂帅，在党的领导下敢想敢干，任何困难都是可以克服的，毛主席的诗句“三峡出平湖”是肯定要实现的。
    中共湖北省委第一书记王任重到会讲了话。长江流域规划办公室主任林一山和总工程师李镇南分别在会上介绍了长江流域和三峡水利枢纽情况，并提出了意见。在中国帮助建设工作的十多位苏联专家也参加会议，并且提出了精湛的见解。
    参加会议的中国科学家和工程技术专家，大家都以主人翁态度，以极大热忱参加这一工作。这次大规模的科学技术研究工作的开端，是和政治战线和思想战线上的重大胜利、生产建设的全面大跃进分不开的；也是和长江流域规划办公室以及其他单位的中苏专家技术人员两年来进行的大量调查勘察和资料收集工作分不开的。
