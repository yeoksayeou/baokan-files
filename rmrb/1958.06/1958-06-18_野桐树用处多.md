    *Mallotus japonicus* Has Many Uses
    In the vast plains, hills, and mountainous areas of Hunan Province, a wild *Mallotus japonicus* tree, commonly known as mountain tongzi, grows. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, highly adaptable, and grows vigorously even on dry and barren wastelands. It has a strong ability to sprout, produces many branches and leaves, and bears fruit early, producing a large amount of fruit in just two or three years. Around Grain Rain every year, many farmers trample its leaves into the fields as green manure, which is highly effective. The Hunan Provincial Forestry Experiment Station has conducted research on *Mallotus japonicus*. It has been found that the oil content of *Mallotus japonicus* seeds reaches 39.56%, and each mu can yield 200 to 300 jin of seeds. *Mallotus japonicus* oil is a drying oil that can be used to make soap, candles, for lighting, and for other purposes. The oil cake is a good fertilizer. Its leaves are also a good pig feed. *Mallotus japonicus* can grow on barren mountains, and even on severely eroded bare mountains, so it can be said to be a pioneer tree species for greening barren mountains and a tree species for maintaining soil and water. Due to its multiple uses, abundant seeds, and ease of cultivation, the forestry and other departments of Hunan Province have paid attention to protecting existing wild *Mallotus japonicus* trees and plan to collect a large number of seeds this autumn for artificial cultivation.

    野桐树用处多
    在湖南省的广大平原、丘陵和山区，野生着一种野桐树，俗名山桐子。它是落叶灌木或小乔木，适应性强，在干燥瘠薄的荒山上都长得茂盛。萌芽力强，枝叶很多，结实早，只要二、三年就大量结实。每年谷雨前后，许多农民就把它的叶子踩入田中当绿肥，肥效很高。湖南省林业试验场对野桐进行了研究。发现野桐的种籽含油率达39.56％，每亩可采籽二百至三百斤。野桐油是干性油，可制肥皂、蜡烛、点灯及其他用途。油饼是很好的肥料。它的叶子也是一种很好的猪饲料。野桐在荒山上，甚至在冲刷严重的光山上都能生长，因此，可说是绿化荒山的先锋树种和保持水土的树种。由于它的用途多、种子多、容易栽培，湖南省林业等部门已注意保护现有野生的桐树，并计划今秋大量采种，用人工培植。
