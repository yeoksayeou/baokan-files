Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 8th. Sofia's working people held a mass rally in Nine-Nine Square on the evening of the 7th to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

When the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and government, as well as the heads of delegations from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties, appeared on the platform of the Dimitrov Mausoleum, the attendees warmly applauded in welcome.

First, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Zhivkov, spoke.

He said that the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party vividly demonstrated the rock-solid and unbreakable unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party, its boundless loyalty to Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the principles of proletarian internationalism, and its determination to fully defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to stand at the forefront of the international communist and workers' movement under any circumstances.

He expressed his gratitude to the delegations of fraternal parties from various countries for participating in the congress. He called on all the people of Bulgaria to selflessly contribute all their strength; to strive to complete and over fulfill the tasks stipulated in the directives of the Third Five-Year Plan with lofty labor and creative enthusiasm, to rapidly develop the country's productive forces, improve the people's welfare, and make Bulgaria increasingly prosperous.

Next, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Khrushchev, spoke. He said that the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party once again demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties, their loyalty to the great and ever-victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, and their determination to further strengthen this unity and defend the revolutionary theory of scientific communism in the struggle against all manifestations of revisionism and opportunism.

He said that the Bulgarian Communist Party has won the love of its people and enjoys high prestige among fraternal parties because of its loyal struggle for the victory of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and for the interests of the people.

In his speech, Khrushchev emphasized the great role of the working people in socialist construction and in the development of Marxist-Leninist theory. He said that the working class and all working people in socialist countries are the masters of their own country. In socialist countries, the people are testing and confirming the principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding the theory of building a communist society with their entire lives and activities.

A worker in a socialist society, no matter what position he holds, even if it is an ordinary position, as long as he works sincerely, he is doing something beneficial to the whole society, and he is confirming and developing Marxist-Leninist theory with his own practice.

Khrushchev said that now, the further development of theoretical thought and social thought is not the merit of individual theorists or a small group of people sitting in offices. Now all the people are participating in this great cause, because shortening the transition from socialism to communism depends on the labor of the people and the efforts of the people.

The head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, Dong Biwu, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the victorious opening and victorious conclusion of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party showed from beginning to end that it was a congress of unity, a congress to accelerate socialist construction, and a congress against modern revisionism. This is not only a major event in the political life of the Bulgarian people, but also a major event in the international communist movement. The Chinese Communist Party delegation congratulates the successful success of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party with Bolshevik high enthusiasm.

Dong Biwu pointed out that the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party not only systematically summarized the experience of Bulgaria's socialist transformation and socialist construction, and formulated a grand plan for further socialist construction, which will greatly promote Bulgaria's further development in all aspects and guide the Bulgarian people from victory to victory.

After pointing out the brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, Dong Biwu said that the Chinese Communists and the Chinese people regard every achievement of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people as their own achievement, because these achievements not only consolidate the Bulgarian socialist system, but also strengthen the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Dong Biwu finally said that the program of the Yugoslav Communist Party is a thorough and thorough anti-Marxist-Leninist revisionist program. Criticizing modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Communist Party program is the sacred duty of Communist parties of all countries. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party has given due attention to criticizing modern revisionism, and the Chinese Communist Party will continue to work with the Bulgarian Communist Party to safeguard the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, adhere to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, thoroughly criticize modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Communist leadership group, and carry this struggle through to the end.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Hoxha, also spoke at the meeting.

He said that your Seventh Congress has once again forcefully shown that the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party is resolutely advancing along its own road with glorious revolutionary traditions, always adopting an irreconcilable attitude towards enemies and traitors of the working class; tirelessly fighting for the principles of proletarian internationalism.

Hoxha emphasized that there is only one way to eliminate the threat of war, and that is to strengthen the solidarity of our great socialist camp, strengthen the solidarity of the international communist movement; unite all democratic forces and peace-loving forces, and fight for peace; and raise the vigilance of our country's people so that they are not deceived by the lies of the imperialists.

He said that those who oppose the independence and freedom of all countries and the imperialists are trying to divide the socialist camp and the international communist movement with their cunning tricks. But they are bound to fail. In this regard, the subversive activities and anti-Marxist theories of the Yugoslav revisionists have given great help to the imperialists.

Hoxha said that maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism is the primary task of every Communist. There is no doubt that in this struggle, revisionism will be completely defeated.

The heads of the Italian, Argentine, and Sudanese Communist Party delegations also spoke at the meeting.

The speeches of Zhivkov and the heads of delegations from fraternal parties were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

This meeting vividly embodied the unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people, and showed their unity and friendship with fraternal parties from all countries.

　　索非亚群众集会庆祝保共七大闭幕
　　兄弟党领导人祝贺保共的伟大胜利
　　董必武同志说：保共第七次代表大会是一个团结的大会，是一个加速社会主义建设的大会，是一个反对现代修正主义的大会。
    据新华社索非亚8日电　索非亚劳动人民7日晚上在九九广场举行了群众大会，庆祝保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会胜利闭幕。
    当保加利亚共产党和政府领导人，苏联共产党、中国共产党和其他兄弟共产党和工人党代表团团长出现在季米特洛夫陵墓台上时，到会者热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    首先，保共中央第一书记日夫科夫讲了话。
    他说，保共第七次代表大会鲜明地显示了保加利亚共产党磐石般的牢不可破的团结，它对马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义原则的无限忠诚，以及它全力保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和在任何情况下都站在国际共产主义运动和工人运动最前列的决心。
    他对各国兄弟党代表团参加代表大会表示感谢。他号召保加利亚全体人民忘我地贡献出自己的全部力量；以崇高的劳动和创造热情来争取完成和超额完成第三个五年计划指示规定的任务，争取迅速发展国家的生产力，提高人民的福利和使保加利亚日益繁荣。
    接着，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫讲话。他说，保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会再一次表明了共产党和工人党队伍的牢不可破的团结，它们对伟大的无往不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜和无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，以及它们今后还要加强这种团结并在同修正主义和机会主义的一切表现的斗争中捍卫科学共产主义的革命理论的决心。
    他说，保加利亚共产党由于为争取马克思列宁主义伟大思想的胜利和为人民利益进行了忠诚的斗争，从而得到了本国人民的爱戴并在兄弟党当中享有很高的威信。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中强调指出劳动人民在社会主义建设中和发展马克思列宁主义理论中的巨大作用。他说，社会主义国家的工人阶级和全体劳动人民是自己国家的主人。在社会主义国家中，人民在以自己全部的生活和活动检验和证实马克思列宁主义关于建设共产主义社会的理论的原则。
    社会主义社会的劳动者无论他站在什么工作岗位上，即使是平凡的工作岗位上，只要他诚恳地劳动，他就是做了有益于整个社会的事，就是以自己的实践在证实和发展马克思列宁主义理论。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在，理论思想、社会思想的进一步发展，并不是坐在办公室中的个别理论家或一小批人的功绩。现在全体人民都参加这个伟大的事业，因为缩短从社会主义到共产主义的过渡路程取决于人民的劳动，取决于人民的努力。
    中国共产党代表团团长董必武也在会上讲了话。他说，保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的胜利召开和它的胜利闭幕，自始至终都显示了它是一个团结的大会，是一个加速社会主义建设的大会，是一个反对现代修正主义的大会。这不仅是保加利亚人民政治生活中的一件大事，而且也是国际共产主义运动中的一件大事。中国共产党代表团以布尔什维克的高度热诚祝贺保共七大的胜利成功。
    董必武指出，保共七大不仅系统地总结了保加利亚社会主义改造和社会主义建设的经验，并为进一步建设社会主义制定了宏伟的计划，将大大地推动保加利亚在各方面进一步的发展，引导保加利亚人民从胜利走向胜利。
    董必武在指出保加利亚人民在共产党领导下和在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营支持下所取得的辉煌成就之后说，中国共产党人和中国人民对于保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民的每一个成就都认为是自己的成就，因为这些成就不仅巩固了保加利亚社会主义制度，也加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和团结。
    董必武最后说，南共纲领是一个彻头彻尾的反马克思列宁主义的修正主义纲领。批判以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义是各国共产党的神圣义务。保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会对于批判现代修正主义给了应有的重视，中国共产党将继续与保加利亚共产党共同努力，维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，彻底批判以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义，并将这一斗争进行到底。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查也在会上讲了话。
    他说，你们的第七次代表大会再一次强有力地表明，光荣的保加利亚共产党坚决地沿着自己的具有光荣革命传统的道路前进，始终对敌人和工人阶级的叛徒采取不调和的态度；不倦地为无产阶级国际主义的原则而斗争。
    霍查强调指出，要消除战争威胁，只有一条道路，那就是加强我们伟大的社会主义阵营的团结一致，加强国际共产主义运动的团结一致；联合一切民主力量和爱好和平的力量，为争取和平而斗争；提高我们国家人民的警惕性，使他们不致受帝国主义者谎话的欺骗。
    他说，反对各国人民的独立和自由的人以及帝国主义者诡计多端地力图分裂社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动。但是他们必定失败。在这方面，颠覆活动和南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思主义理论给了帝国主义者很大的帮助。
    霍查说，维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁——是每一个共产党人的主要任务。毫无疑问，在这个斗争中，修正主义必将彻底失败。
    在大会上讲话的还有意大利、阿根廷和苏丹共产党代表团的团长。
    日夫科夫和各国兄弟党代表团团长的讲话受到到会者的热烈欢迎。
    这次大会鲜明地体现了保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民的团结，显示了他们同各国兄弟党的团结和友谊。
