Bulgaria Strides Forward
Bulgaria, Luo Petrov
    The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party opened on June 2nd. Guided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the congress will summarize the achievements of the Party's policies, formulate tasks for further advancing along the socialist road in political, economic, and cultural construction, and arm the Party and the people with a new grand program of socialist construction.
    For nearly fourteen years, the workers and peasants of Bulgaria have been freed from the oppression of the bourgeoisie. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have transformed Bulgaria from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial-agricultural socialist country. Thanks to the correct policies of the Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have built hundreds of new factories, power stations, reservoirs, and mines equipped with the latest technology; they have established industrial sectors unheard of in capitalist Bulgaria, such as non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy, machine manufacturing, shipbuilding, heavy chemical industry, and electric power industry. With the rapid development of heavy industry, the production of daily necessities has also greatly increased. Now, compared with the pre-war year of 1939, the total industrial output has increased sixfold.
    The Bulgarian Communist Party has successfully solved one of the most difficult tasks after the working class seized power, namely, the socialist transformation of agriculture. Based on the traditions and conditions of the Bulgarian countryside, the Party creatively applied Lenin's cooperative plan, organizing small, scattered individual farmers into large, mechanized agricultural production cooperatives on a voluntary basis. Now, more than 90% of the country's arable land has been cooperativized. Socialism has triumphed not only in the cities but also in the countryside.
    With the comprehensive assistance of the state, cooperatives are increasingly consolidated and prospering. In the past five years, agricultural output has increased by 25%.
    Due to the victory of the cooperative system in the countryside, the socialist mode of production has occupied a dominant position in the entire national economy. In 1957, the socialist sector of the national economy accounted for 98% of industrial output, about 90% of agricultural output, and more than 99% of the national commodity turnover.
    The socialist transformation of the economy has brought about fundamental changes in the class structure of our country's society. Exploiting classes and the phenomenon of exploitation have been eliminated. Now our society is composed of two friendly classes: workers and peasants—cooperative members—with whom the people's intellectuals are inextricably linked.
    The Party is most concerned about improving the people's material well-being and cultural level. The most striking sign of the continuous growth of people's welfare is the increase in national income and the actual income of working people. In the second five-year plan (1953-1957) alone, Bulgaria's national income increased by 46%, and the actual income of working people increased by 55%. During this period, residents' purchasing power doubled. The state, cooperatives, and individuals have built residential buildings on a large scale, and the state has provided long-term loans with an annual interest rate of two percent to help individuals build houses. More than 250,000 new houses have been built in cities and rural areas. Electricity, radio, and movies have penetrated the daily lives of farmers. In the seventy years of bourgeois rule, only 784 villages in Bulgaria were electrified, while in the era of people's power, 2,456 villages have been electrified.
    In addition, the amount of pensions has increased, the wages of low-income earners and the amount of family allowances have been expanded, a pension system has been implemented in agricultural production cooperatives, the cost of meals in workers' canteens has been reduced, and the prices of daily necessities are constantly decreasing.
    The people's government has allocated a large amount of funds for the health care of working people. Residents can enjoy free medical care, and the number of medical institutions has doubled compared with 1939. Before liberation from fascist rule, Bulgaria had only one maternity hospital, but now it has 710. In the course of the cultural revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party, a large number of intellectuals loyal to the people have grown up, the people's cultural level is rapidly improving, and progressive science and art are developing and flourishing.
    Contrary to the assertions of revisionists, our practice proves that the construction of socialist society is not a spontaneous process, but a planned and organized activity carried out by the socialist state under the leadership of the Communist Party. The reason why we have achieved success in socialist industrialization, agricultural cooperativization, and improving the people's living standards is that the Party resolutely implements the scientifically-based policies formulated by previous congresses, and constantly explains these policies to the masses of people, mobilizing the people to overcome various difficulties. The Party teaches its members to always stand at the forefront of difficulties, to give play to creative initiative in socialist competition, to drive workers and peasants with their heroic actions, and to always be vigilant against class enemies.
    Contrary to the claims of imperialists and revisionists, our practice fully proves that building socialism is only possible with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and close cooperation with other socialist countries. Therefore, the Bulgarian Communist Party considers its primary task to be to fight for the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and for the unity of the international workers' movement and the communist movement. The Party educates its members and all the Bulgarian people to be loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, loyal to the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, and to respect and unite all people who are fighting for peace and democracy.
    Our working people are very concerned about the convening of the Party's Seventh Congress. They will hear the Party's correct opinions on major international and domestic issues from the Congress platform, and they will receive the Party's instructions on the tasks of socialist construction. Through the Seventh Congress, the Bulgarian Communist Party will lead the Bulgarian people more unitedly and confidently towards the complete victory of socialism and communism.

　　阔步前进中的保加利亚
　　保加利亚　罗·彼得罗夫
    保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会于6月2日开幕。代表大会将以马克思列宁主义原则为指南，总结党的政策的成果，制定今后在政治、经济和文化建设方面进一步沿社会主义道路前进的任务，并以社会主义建设的新的宏伟纲领武装党和人民。
    保加利亚的工人和农民摆脱了资产阶级的压迫已将近十四年了，他们在共产党的领导下使保加利亚从落后的农业国变成了先进的工业一农业社会主义国家。由于共产党的正确的政策，保加利亚人民建成了数百个新的、拥有最新技术装备的工厂、发电站、水库和矿井；建立起资本主义的保加利亚从所未闻的工业部门，如有色和黑色冶金业、机器制造业、造船业、重化学工业、电力工业等。随着重工业的迅速发展，日用品生产也大大增加了。现在同战前的1939年相比，工业总产量提高了六倍。
    保加利亚共产党顺利地解决了工人阶级夺取政权以后最困难的一项任务，即农业社会主义改造的任务。党根据保加利亚农村的传统和条件，创造性地运用了列宁的合作化计划，在自愿的原则下把小的、分散的个体农户组织成大的机械化的农业生产合作社。现在全国90％以上的耕地都已合作化了。社会主义不仅在城市中，并且在农村中也取得了胜利。
    在国家全面的帮助下，合作社日益巩固和繁荣，最近五年间，农业产量增加了25％。
    由于合作社制度在农村的胜利，社会主义生产方式在整个国民经济中占据了统治地位。1957年，国民经济中的社会主义成分在工业产量中占98％，在农业产量中占90％左右；在全国商品周转额中占99％以上。
    经济的社会主义改造引起了我国社会阶级结构的根本变化。剥削阶级和人剥削人的现象消灭了。现在我国社会由工人和农民一合作社社员——这两个友好的阶级组成，人民的知识分子同他们不可分割地联系着。
    党最关心人民的物质福利和文化水平的提高。人民福利不断增长的最鲜明的标志，就是国民收入和劳动人民实际收入的增长。仅在第二个五年计划（1953年—1957年）中，保加利亚的国民收入就增加了46％，劳动人民的实际收入增加了55％。在这个期间居民的购买力增加了一倍。国家、合作社和个人建造的住宅规模很大，国家为了帮助个人建造住宅，发放了年利二厘的长期贷款。在城市和农村盖起了二十五万多幢新房屋。电力、无线电和电影已经深入到农民的日常生活之中。保加利亚在资产阶级统治的七十年中间仅有七百八十四个村子电气化了，而在人民政权的年代里，电气化的村庄达二千四百五十六个。
    此外，抚恤金的金额增加了，低工薪者的工资和家庭补助的金额都扩大了，在农业生产合作社里实行了养老金制度，工人食堂的伙食费减低了，日用必需品的价格也在不断降低。
    人民政权在劳动人民保健方面拨出的经费数量很大。居民可以享受免费医疗，同1939年相比，医疗机构增加了两倍。在摆脱法西斯统治以前，保加利亚总共只有一所产院，现在则有七百一十所。在共产党领导的文化革命过程中间，大批忠实于人民的知识分子成长起来，人民的文化水平在迅速提高，进步的科学和艺术在发展和繁荣中。
    同修正主义者的断言相反，我们的实践证明，社会主义社会的建设不是自发过程，而是共产党领导的社会主义国家进行的有计划、有组织的活动。我们在社会主义工业化、农业合作化和提高人民生活水平方面所以取得成就，是因为党坚决贯彻历次代表大会制定的有科学根据的政策，并且始终不懈地向人民群众解释这些政策，发动人民克服各种困难。党教导自己的成员永远站在困难的最前列，在社会主义竞赛中发挥创造积极性，用自己的英雄行为带动工人和农民，并对阶级敌人永远保持警惕。
    同帝国主义者和修正主义者的说法相反，我们的实践充分证明，建设社会主义只有在苏联兄弟般的帮助和同其他社会主义国家密切合作之下才有可能。因此，保加利亚共产党认为自己首要的任务是为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、为国际工人运动和共产主义运动的团结而斗争。党教育自己的成员和全体保加利亚人民忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，忠实于苏联和整个社会主义阵营，尊敬和团结所有为和平民主而斗争的人民。
    我国劳动人民非常关心党的第七次代表大会的召开，他们将听到大会讲台上发出的党对国际、国内重大问题的正确意见，他们将得到党对社会主义建设任务的指示。保加利亚共产党通过第七次代表大会，将更加团结地、满怀信心地领导保加利亚人民向社会主义和共产主义的全胜迈进。　（方译）（附图片）
