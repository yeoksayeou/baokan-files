　　Dare to Think Independently
　　Yi Mao
    In the past, someone wrote a poem mocking parrots, saying, "Though their teeth and tongues glean bits of wisdom, they should be ashamed of their parrot-like repetition." It also said, "Better to be the oriole with its hundred warbles, its natural voice a language of its own." This speaks to the importance of originality in writing, of not simply echoing others or repeating what they say. This principle, though small, can be applied to greater matters. If it is so for writing, how much more so for speaking, doing things, and making revolution?
    To be a good Marxist, one must be adept at combining the universal truths of Marxism with the realities of revolution, and one must dare to use the spirit of this theory, based on new historical conditions, to solve problems that the founders of Marxism did not solve. To achieve this, one must approach Marxism with a spirit of independent thinking.
    We communists have always opposed dogmatism and advocated independent thinking. Comrade Mao Zedong was the most outstanding master in independently thinking, in using the universal truth of Marxism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution, thus enriching and developing Marxism. He taught us: "...sniff at everything and distinguish its good from its bad before deciding whether to welcome it or resist it. Communists must ask 'why' about everything, and after careful consideration in their own minds, think about whether it is in accordance with reality and whether it is truly reasonable. They must never be blindly obedient, and they must never advocate slavishness."
    To oppose blind obedience and slavishness, one must first have the proletarian style of daring to break superstitions and daring to think independently. Because superstition is the opposite of independent thinking, with superstition, there is no independent thinking. Those who are superstitious of ghosts and gods dare not doubt ghosts and gods; those who believe in fatalism dare not resist fate; those who are superstitious of the ancients unconditionally praise the past and denigrate the present, always lamenting that each generation is worse than the last; those who are superstitious of foreigners even believe that the moon is rounder in foreign countries. All of these are manifestations of people losing confidence in controlling their own destiny, of surrendering and submitting to external pressures under the rule of irresistible natural or social forces.
    Today, in our land, the phenomenon of man oppressing man has been eliminated, but there are still many people who have not achieved liberation in the spiritual realm. For example, some people, in the face of bourgeois academic "authorities," are intimidated by their "knowledge" and "qualifications," as if they are fundamentally unworthy of discussing academic matters unless they have read tens of thousands of books and can write tens of thousands of words. From fearing them, they come to worship them, unconsciously becoming their prisoners, allowing reactionary academic thoughts to run rampant, and not daring to criticize them. For example, when studying Marxism and learning from the experiences of revolution and construction, some people also adopt a superstitious attitude, always believing that Chinese people are inferior to foreigners, later generations are inferior to previous generations, that Marxism cannot be developed, and that it is not the turn of Chinese people to develop it even if it could be. Therefore, when studying, they always blindly copy and apply things mechanically, which leads to the mistake of dogmatism. Strictly speaking, all of this is caused by a slave mentality, which is incompatible with the lofty and overwhelming style of the working people.
    The working people are the creators of history, and their initiative and creativity have always been very rich. It was only suppressed and not brought into play in class society. Today, once the lid is lifted and superstitions are broken, they show a style of daring to think and dare to act, daring to do and daring to be. We Marxists should be even more bold and fearless revolutionaries, and we should have even more heroic spirit of turning the world upside down. Our revolutionary teachers are models of this style. One hundred and ten years ago, Marx and Engels challenged the old world on behalf of the world's proletarians. Forty years ago, Lenin was not afraid of capitalist encirclement and firmly believed that the revolution could first achieve victory in one country. Thirty years ago, Chairman Mao declared to the people of the whole country on Jinggang Mountain: A single spark can start a prairie fire! Today, since the working people of our country have achieved revolutionary victory and have become the rulers of the real world, there is no doubt that they must also become the rulers of the spiritual world. As long as we break superstitions and invigorate our spirits, there are no fortresses that cannot be conquered, no enemies that cannot be overthrown, and no difficulties that cannot be overcome in the face of communists.
    Of course, to think independently, one must have the correct direction. I remember that the China Youth Daily once published an article on this issue, and the author made a very interesting analogy: if a group of navigators were to think independently and throw away the compass, and have a "hundred schools of thought contend" to argue for a direction of navigation, we would definitely laugh at them as fools. To do scholarship and think about things, one must also have a compass, without a compass, there is no direction. The issue of standpoint is the issue of direction. Therefore, to think independently, one must stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint.
    The proletariat is the most progressive class in history. The spirit of selfless devotion enables them to get rid of any prejudice, face objective reality squarely, and dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes. Therefore, the firmer people's class standpoint is, the more objectively they can analyze problems, the more they can discover objective laws, that is to say, the more independently they can think. On the contrary, the bourgeois rightists and all modern revisionists, although repeatedly flaunt "independent thinking" or brazenly proclaim themselves as "creative Marxism," but the things they think out do not have any "independent" or "creative" stuff. For example, Marxism is outdated, the whole world is growing into socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat creates bureaucracy, etc., may I ask which of these is not a verbatim copy of the old tunes that opportunists like old Bernstein sang decades ago? The reason why this is so is not simply the incompetence of these gentlemen, but mainly their class standpoint at work. They are actually parrots of capitalism, only imitating the tone of the bourgeoisie, viciously slandering the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the communist parties of various countries. Although they also hang Marxism on their lips and attack "dogmatism"; however, what they attack is precisely the basic principles of the revolutionary theory laid down by Marx and Engels and developed by Lenin and other great Marxists. Historical experience proves that whoever leaves Marxism is bound to fall into the reactionary quagmire. In the quagmire, there is only the freedom to wallow, there is no freedom of independent thinking.
    But to conduct independent thinking correctly, in addition to standing firm on our standpoint, it is also very important to correct our way of thinking.
    According to the Marxist theory of knowledge, first of all, we must solve the basic question of philosophy materialistically, and admit that our senses are a reflection of the outside world. That is to say, we must take the materials obtained from perceptual knowledge as the starting point for independent thinking; without perceptual knowledge, without seriously analyzing reality, what we think out can only be subjective. The thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods of any heroes and heroines can only be a reflection of the objective world, and their raw materials or semi-finished products can only come from the practice of the people or themselves. The reason why we make subjective mistakes in our work is because we do not understand this simple truth and violate materialism.
    Secondly, we must give full play to the active role of thinking ability in the process of cognition. Perceptual knowledge can only reveal the external relations of things. To understand the internal and essential connections of things, we must rely on thinking ability to refine the materials obtained from perceptual knowledge, removing the crude and retaining the essence, and going from the superficial to the deep, and then produce thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods. The reason why intellectual sluggards are undesirable is because they are unwilling to use their brains to analyze problems. They either rely only on past experience or only on book knowledge to deal with problems and carry out work. They do not understand that truth is concrete, and everything changes with time, place, and conditions. Experience and book knowledge are certainly valuable, but if they are not combined with local conditions, they will become dead dogmas. Using dead dogmas to deal with living reality, it is difficult not to make subjective mistakes!
    Thirdly, we must take practice as the highest standard for measuring the correctness of the thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods that are thought out independently. The human brain reflects objective things, and it is always subject to various subjective and objective conditions; objective circumstances change, and there are always unexpected things. Therefore, we must repeat the process many times to gradually achieve correctness. Our understanding of revolutionary laws was groped for after experiencing many failures. Today, thanks to Chairman Mao's correct leadership, the learning of advanced Soviet experience, and so on, our groping process for mastering the laws of construction has been greatly shortened. The general line for building socialism determined by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party was formulated based on the practical experience of the people's struggle in recent years and the development of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, and it is a correct reflection of the objective laws of socialist construction in our country. However, even so, this general line still needs to be continuously tested in future practice, and to be continuously developed and perfected.
    Practice, knowledge, re-practice, re-knowledge, this is the process of deepening human knowledge, and it is also the process by which we gradually learn to think correctly. As long as we stand firm on our standpoint, have the right way of thinking, and are willing to use our brains to think hard and think more, our thoughts can be greatly liberated. Liberated people plus liberated thoughts will exert an immeasurable force in building socialism!

### 要敢于独立思考

　　要敢于独立思考
　　易茅
    从前有人做诗嘲笑鹦鹉说：“齿牙余慧虽偷拾，那识雷同转可羞。”又说：“争似流莺当百啭，天真还是一家言。”说的是写文章贵有独创精神，不要人云亦云，拾人牙慧。此理虽小，可以喻大。写文章如此，说话、做事情、干革命又何尝不是如此？
    要做一个好的马克思主义者，就要善于以马克思主义的普遍真理和革命的实际相结合，就要敢于根据这个理论的精神，根据新的历史条件，解决马克思主义创始人不曾解决过的问题。要做到这一点，就必须以独立思考的精神来对待马克思主义。
    我们共产党人历来都是反对教条主义，提倡独立思考的。毛泽东同志正是最杰出的善于独立思考、善于运用马克思主义普遍真理来解决中国革命问题，从而丰富和发展了马克思主义的巨匠。他教导我们说：“……对于任何东西都用鼻子嗅一嗅，鉴别其好坏，然后才决定欢迎它，或者抵制它。共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”
    要反对盲从，反对奴隶主义，首先就要有敢于破除迷信，敢于独立思考的无产阶级的风格。因为迷信是独立思考的反面，有了迷信就没有独立思考。迷信鬼神者，对鬼神不敢怀疑；命定论者对命运不敢反抗；迷信古人者，无条件颂古非今，总叹息一代不如一代；迷信洋人者，甚至认为月亮也是外国的圆。如此种种，都是人们在不可抗拒的自然力量或社会力量统治下，丧失掌握自己命运信心、对外界压力屈服投降的表现。
    今天，在我们的国土上，人压迫人的现象已经消灭了，但是还有不少的人，在精神领域中没有获得解放。例如，有些人在资产阶级学术“权威”面前，被他们的“学问”“资格”吓倒了，好像不曾读破万卷书，不能下笔数万言，就根本不配谈学术似的，由惧怕他们到崇拜他们，无形中做了他们的俘虏，听任反动的学术思想泛滥，也不敢加以批判。又例如，学习马克思主义，学习革命和建设的经验时，有些人也是采取迷信态度，总认为中国人不如外国人，后代人不如前代人，马克思主义无法发展，要发展也轮不到中国人。因此，学习时总是不加分析地生搬硬套，以致犯了教条主义的错误。这一切，严格说来，都是奴隶心理在作祟，都是和劳动人民的高屋建瓴、势如破竹的风格不相容的。
    劳动人民是历史的创造者，他们的积极性创造性历来就是很丰富的。只是在阶级社会里受到压抑，没有发挥。今天，一揭开盖子，破除迷信，他们就表现出敢想敢干，敢作敢为的风格来了。我们马克思主义者更应该是大胆无畏的革命家，更应该具有翻天复地的英雄气概。我们的革命导师就是这种风格的楷模。一百一十年前马克思恩格斯代表全世界无产者向旧世界挑战。四十年前列宁不怕资本主义包围，坚信革命可以在一国首先取得胜利。三十年前，毛主席在井冈山上向全国人民宣布：星星之火，可以燎原！今天我国劳动人民既然取得了革命的胜利，已经成为现实世界的统治者，毫无疑义地也必须成为精神世界的统治者。只要破除迷信，振作精神，在共产党人面前是没有攻不破的堡垒，没有打不倒的敌人，没有克服不了的困难的。
    当然，要独立思考必须要有正确的方向。记得中国青年报上曾发表一篇关于这个问题的文章，作者打过一个非常有趣的比方：如果有一批航海者要独立思考而抛掉指南针，来一个“百家争鸣”，争出一个航行方向来，我们一定笑他们是傻子。做学问、想事情也要有指南针，不要指南针就没有了方向。立场问题就是方向问题。所以要独立思考，必须要站稳无产阶级立场。
    无产阶级是历史上最进步的阶级。大公无私的精神促使他们能够摆脱任何偏见，正视客观现实，敢于坚持真理和修正错误。因此，人们的阶级立场愈是坚定，就愈能够客观地分析问题，愈能够发现客观规律，也就是说，愈能够独立地进行思考。相反的，资产阶级右派以及一切现代修正主义者虽然一再标榜“独立思考”，或者大言不惭地自封为“创造性的马克思主义”，但是他们所思考出来的东西，并没有什么“独立”“创造”的货色。例如，马克思主义过时了呀，全世界都在长入社会主义呀，无产阶级专政造成官僚主义呀等等，试问哪一条不是照抄几十年前老伯恩斯坦之类的机会主义者早就唱过的滥调？其所以如此，不单纯是这些先生们的低能，主要的还是他们的阶级立场在作怪。他们实际上是资本主义的鹦鹉，才模仿资产阶级的口吻，恶毒地谩骂以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和各国共产党人。他们在口头上虽然也挂着马克思主义，也攻击“教条主义”；但是，他们所攻击的正是马克思、恩格斯所奠定的，经过列宁和其他伟大的马克思主义者加以发展的革命理论的基本原则。历史经验证明：谁要离开马克思主义，谁就必然要掉入反动的泥潭。在泥潭里只有打滚的自由，没有什么独立思考的自由。
    但是要正确地进行独立思考，除了站稳立场之外，端正我们的思想方法也是很重要的。
    按照马克思主义的认识论，首先，必须唯物论地解决哲学的基本问题，承认我们的感觉是外界的反映。就是说，我们必须以感性认识所获得的材料，作为独立思考的出发点；没有感性知识，不去认真分析实际，想出来的东西只能是主观主义的。任何英雄豪杰的思想、意见、计划、办法，只能是客观世界的反映，其原材料或半成品只能来自人民群众的或自己的实践中。我们之所以在工作中犯主观主义的错误，都是由于不明白这条简单的真理、违反了唯物论的缘故。
    其次，必须充分发挥思考能力在认识过程中的积极作用。感性认识只能揭发事物的外部关系。要认识事物内部的、本质的联系，就必须借助于思考能力，把感性认识所获得的材料予以去粗存精、由表及里的加工，然后产生出思想、意见、计划、办法来。思想懒汉之所以要不得，就因为他不肯用脑筋去分析问题。他们或者只凭过去经验，或者只凭书本知识去处理问题和进行工作。他们不懂得真理都是具体的，一切都是以时间、地点、条件为转移的。经验、书本知识固然宝贵，但是不和当地情况相结合，都会变成死教条。用死教条来对付活现实，要想不犯主观主义的错误，难矣哉！
    再次，必须以实践作为衡量独立思考出来的思想、意见、计划、办法的正确性的最高标准。人的脑子反映客观事物，总要受到种种主客观条件的限制；客观情况变化，总有预料不到的地方。因此，必须循环往复多次，才能逐步达到正确。我们对革命规律的认识，是在经历了多次失败之后，才摸索到的。今天，由于毛主席的正确领导，苏联先进经验的学习等等，我们掌握建设规律的摸索过程已经大大缩短了。党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议所确定的建设社会主义的总路线就是根据几年来人民斗争的实际经验和毛泽东同志的思想的发展制定出来的，它是我国社会主义建设客观规律的正确反映。但是，即使如此，这条总路线依然需要在今后的实践中继续考验，并且使它继续发展和完备起来。
    实践，认识，再实践，再认识，这是人类认识的深化过程，也是我们逐步学会正确思考的过程。只要立场坚定，思想方法对头，肯用脑筋苦想、多想，我们的思想就可以获得大解放。解放了的人民加上解放了的思想，在建设社会主义中将要发挥无法估计的力量！
