Guangzhou, June 7th (Reporters Zhang Shikui and Zheng Shiwen): Guangdong Province's 33 million mu of early rice is expected to have an unprecedented bumper harvest. The eastern region of Hainan Island, where the season started earlier, is nearing the end of harvesting; about six million mu of early-maturing varieties across the province have generally turned yellow and are beginning to be harvested. It is expected that the entire province will enter a busy summer harvest in late June.

Currently, the vast majority of rice crops in Guangdong Province are growing very luxuriantly. In the two major grain-producing areas—the Chaoshan Plain and the Pearl River Delta—the rice crops have many effective panicles, numerous grains, and are heavy. It is estimated that there will likely be an unprecedented high-yield record over a large area. The average yield of early rice per mu can reach 500 jin. The per-mu yield of early rice in the Pearl River Delta is almost equivalent to the average per-mu yield of the three seasons of last year. The Jianjiang Plain, which has historically suffered the most from drought, experienced the same minimal rainfall and severe drought during this early season as in the past, but the fields are filled with the best seedlings ever seen. The one million mu of cadre experimental fields distributed throughout the province are growing even more exceptionally well.

Based on the actual results of the already harvested areas and the examples of rice fields about to be harvested, the increase in early rice production in the province this year is very significant. In Hainan Island, a low-yield area with relatively backward cultivation in the past, this year's early rice has also shown great splendor. The 880-plus mu of early rice in the Yuguang Cooperative of Wanning County, which have been harvested, achieved an average yield of 640 jin per mu, an increase of more than 120 jin per mu compared to last year's early season. In the Pearl River Delta, which is about to be harvested, the Huangqi Township of Nanhai County in the Foshan Special Zone recently conducted a field appraisal of more than 20,520 mu of early rice in the township. The estimated yield of 700 jin or more accounted for more than 8,350 mu, or 40%; more than 9,000 mu with yields of 600 jin or more, accounted for 45%; and about 3,100 mu with yields of about 450 jin, accounted for only 15%. It is estimated that the average yield per mu in the township can reach more than 610 jin, an increase of nearly 80% compared to the same period last year. The Niuqitang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongguan County, Huiyang Special Zone, has already harvested ten mu of early-maturing rice planted in the most barren, low-lying, and waterlogged fields, with an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu. In the historically high-yielding Chaoshan Plain, only a few areas could achieve an average early rice harvest of 500 jin per mu in the past, but this year, early rice yields of 500 jin or more are almost ubiquitous throughout the region. The situation in the nationally famous thousand-jin counties of Chao'an and Chenghai is even more encouraging: Chao'an County is expected to achieve an average yield of 660 jin per mu throughout the county, an increase of 240 jin per mu compared to the same period last year; the Guanlong Cooperative in Sunan Township, Chenghai County, is expected to harvest 800 jin per mu throughout the cooperative. It is estimated that the per-mu yield of early rice in the one million mu of cadre experimental fields throughout the province will be 800 jin or even 1,000 jin or more. The two mu of experimental fields of the director of the Wanqun Cooperative in Beipo Township, Wanning County, Hainan Island, actually yielded an average of 1,200 jin per mu. The 30 mu of high-yield experimental fields of the Xindong Cooperative in Lianping County, Huiyang Special Zone, had more than 249,000 panicles per mu, with many panicles bearing more than 230 grains and some bearing more than 80 grains. Assuming an average of 100 grains per panicle, it is estimated that the yield per mu will be 1,250 jin. It is estimated that the yield of the 1.5 mu experimental field of the Guanlong Cooperative in Sunan Township, Chenghai County, will be as high as 1,700 jin.

The unprecedentedly good growth of early rice in Guangdong Province this year is inseparable from the arduous struggle and bold reform of cultivation techniques by the vast number of farmers in the agricultural Great Leap Forward. From last winter to this spring, farmers across the province continuously fought hard for more than four months, completing nearly ten billion cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, expanding the benefited area to more than 27 million mu; among them, the newly added irrigation area alone reached more than 11 million mu, equivalent to the sum of the benefited area of water conservancy projects built throughout the history of Guangdong Province. At the same time, large-scale soil improvement and manure accumulation were carried out, with manure accumulation alone reaching 20 billion dan, an average of 400 dan of manure per mu. All of these laid a good foundation for this year's early production.

However, the more important reasons for the bumper harvest of early rice are the promotion of early planting and close planting, especially close planting. The benefit of advancing spring plowing this year is that although we also encountered dozens of consecutive days of spring drought, various localities were able to have sufficient time to divert water for drought resistance and transplant rice seedlings. Instead of delaying agricultural seasons due to drought as in previous years, we advanced an agricultural season, and the entire province basically completed the transplanting of early rice before and after Qingming. When transplanting rice seedlings, we also generally changed the old habit of planting no more than 10,000 seedlings per mu in the past and widely promoted close planting, basically reaching about 20,000 seedlings per mu. Due to the widespread implementation of close planting, about 85% of the early rice in the province now generally has 160,000 to 200,000 panicles per mu, an increase of 30,000 to 40,000 panicles compared to last year. If each panicle has an average of 50 grains and every 20,000 grains are converted to one jin, then each mu will yield 75 jin to 100 jin more than last year.

The field management of early rice in Guangdong Province this year has also been done well. Generally, three to four times of cultivating, topdressing, weeding, and pest control have been carried out, and every effort has been made to conduct a concentrated rescue of the three types of rice with poor growth.

At present, although we are facing the harvest season, the second generation of rice stem borers is also in full bloom, rice blast has also begun to appear in some areas, and floods and typhoons will also occur from time to time during this period. In order to ensure the bumper harvest of early rice this year, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has repeatedly instructed various localities to overcome complacency and the idea of waiting for a bumper harvest, continue to strengthen field management, pay attention to drainage and irrigation, prevent lodging and control diseases and insect pests, and strengthen flood and typhoon prevention preparations, and strive to ensure that the fruits of hard work are returned to the family.

　　广东早稻大放异彩
    亩产量和丰产面积将创本省空前纪录
    一百万亩干部试验田估计亩产八百斤到一千斤
    本报广州7日电　　记者张仕楷、郑世文报道：广东省三千三百多万亩早稻可望空前大丰收。季节较早的海南岛东部地区接近收割完毕；全省约六百万亩左右的早熟种已普遍黄熟，开始收割。预计到本月下旬全省各地即将全面进入夏收大忙。
    目前，广东省各地绝大多数的禾稻都生长得非常繁茂。著名的两大粮产区——潮汕平原和珠江三角洲的禾稻，有效穗多，粒多实重，据估计，很可能出现本地区历史上从来没有过的大面积产量最高纪录。早稻每亩平均产量可达五百斤。珠江三角洲的早稻亩产量，差不多相当于去年全年三季的平均亩产量。历来受旱最严重的鉴江平原，虽然在今年早造期间和过去一样降雨极少、旱情不轻，但是田野上却是一片从没有过的好禾苗。分布在全省各地的一百万亩干部试验田，有很多更长得出类拔萃。
    根据目前已经收割的实绩和即将收割的稻田的实例看来，今年全省早稻的增产幅度是非常大的。在过去一向耕作比较落后的低产区海南岛，今年的早稻也放出了异彩。已经收割完毕的万宁县裕光社的八百八十多亩早稻每亩平均产量达六百四十斤，比去年早造每亩增产一百二十斤以上。在即将收割的珠江三角洲上，佛山专区南海县黄岐乡最近对全乡二万零五百二十多亩早稻进行田间鉴定的结果，估计产量在七百斤以上的有八千三百五十多亩，占40％；六百斤以上的有九千多亩，占45％；产量在四百五十斤左右的约三千一百多亩，仅占15％。预计全乡平均每亩可达六百一十斤以上，比去年同期增产将近八成。惠阳专区东莞县牛琦塘农业社已经收割的十亩种在土质最贫瘠的低洼积水田中的早熟稻，每亩平均产量也超过了五百斤。一向高产的潮汕平原，过去历年来只有个别地区可以达到早稻每亩平均收成五百斤，而今年全区预计早稻达到五百斤以上的几乎比比皆是。全国著名的千斤县潮安、澄海等县的情景更令人振奋：潮安县预计全县平均每亩可收成六百六十斤，比去年同期每亩增产达二百四十斤；澄海县苏南乡官陇社全社预计每亩可收割八百斤。全省一百万亩干部试验田中估计早稻每亩产量都将在八百斤以至一千斤以上。海南岛万宁县北坡乡万群社主任的两亩试验田，平均每亩实收一千二百斤，惠阳专区连平县新东社的三十亩丰产试验田每亩有二十四万九千多穗，每穗结谷多的达二百三十多粒，少的也有八十多粒。平均以一百粒计算，估计每亩可收成一千二百五十斤。澄海县苏南乡官陇社的一亩五分试验田，估计产量更可高达一千七百斤。
    广东省今年的早稻生长空前良好，是和今年广大农民在农业大跃进中艰苦奋战和大胆改革耕作技术分不开的。去冬今春，全省农民连续苦战了四个多月，完成了将近十亿土方的水利工程，使受益面积扩大到二千七百多万亩；其中仅新增加的灌溉面积达一千一百多万亩，相当于广东省有史以来历年所修水利的受益面积的总和。同时还进行了大规模的改良土质和积肥，其中仅积肥一项就达二百亿担，平均每亩积肥四百担。所有这些都为今年的早造生产打下了良好的基础。
    但是，促成早稻大丰收的更重要的原因，是推行了早插和密植，特别是密植的缘故。今年提早春耕的好处是，今年虽然也遇到连续好几十天缺雨的春旱，但是各地能够有比较充裕的时间引水抗旱插秧，不但不像往年那样因旱而延误农时，反而提早了一个农事季节，清明前后全省便基本完成了早稻的插秧工作。插秧时，又普遍改变了过去每亩插植不过一万科禾苗的老习惯，大面积地推广密植，基本上达到每亩插植二万科左右。由于广泛的实行密植，目前全省85％左右的早稻，每亩一般都结有十六万穗到二十万穗，比去年增加三万穗到四万穗。如果以每穗平均有五十粒谷，而每二万粒谷折合一市斤计算的话，则每亩将可比去年增产七十五斤到一百斤。
    广东省今年早稻的田间管理工作也做得好，一般都做到三次到四次的中耕、追肥、除草和除虫，并想尽千方百计对生长不好的三类禾进行突击抢救。
    目前，虽然已面临收获季节，但是第二代三化螟虫也正在盛放，稻热病也开始在部分地区出现，洪水、台风在这段期间也将会不时出现。为了确保今年早稻的大丰收，中共广东省委已一再指示各地，克服太平麻痹、坐待丰收的思想，继续加强田间管理，注意排灌、防止倒伏和防治病虫害，并加强防洪、防风的准备，务求做到苦战的果实颗粒还家。
