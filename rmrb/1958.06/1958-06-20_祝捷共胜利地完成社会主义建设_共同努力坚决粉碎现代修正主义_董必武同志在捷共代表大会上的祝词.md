Dear Comrades:
    On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, I extend fraternal and warm congratulations to your Congress, and through your Congress, to the Communist Party members and all working people of Czechoslovakia who are building socialism.
    Your Party's 11th Congress is being held on the tenth anniversary of your historic and glorious February Victory. For ten years, under the correct leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and thanks to the selfless labor of the Czechoslovak working people, your socialist construction has made tremendous achievements. Since 1948, your industrial output has tripled, making Czechoslovakia one of the most advanced countries in the world in terms of per capita industrial production; in agriculture, socialist relations of production have also achieved a decisive advantage in the last two years. The Czechoslovak Communist Party attaches importance to ideological work, tirelessly educating the people with Marxism-Leninism to raise their communist consciousness and transform intellectuals. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has also consistently cared for the people's lives. With the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production, the Czechoslovak people now enjoy a high material and cultural life.
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak Government have consistently pursued Lenin's foreign policy of peaceful coexistence, and have waged resolute struggles to defend European and world peace and to support the independence and liberation movements of oppressed nations, making significant contributions in this regard. The Czechoslovak Communist Party is faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, adheres to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has waged an irreconcilable struggle against the imperialist reactionaries who undermine the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and against modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Communist program. We, the Chinese people, are very pleased to see all the above-mentioned achievements you have made in building socialism and defending world peace, and regard these achievements as a sign of the growth of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the world's forces for peace.
    Your Congress, following the bold slogan put forward not long ago—to catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries in per capita industrial output in the shortest possible time—has put forward the historically significant slogan of completing socialist construction, and will formulate a series of tasks in political, economic, and ideological work to achieve the above-mentioned great goal. The Chinese Communist Party greatly admires your Party's infinite confidence in its cause and its spirit of courageously advancing, and firmly believes that you will surely be able to achieve the established goals victoriously.
    We, the Chinese people, who have a deep friendship with the Czechoslovak people, are also working hard to build our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. We have successively achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. Not long ago, our Party held its Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and defined the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism for our people. The basic points of this general line are: to mobilize all positive factors, correctly handle contradictions among the people; consolidate and develop the socialist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and proletarian international unity; while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, gradually realize the technical revolution and cultural revolution; under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, develop industry and agriculture simultaneously; under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, develop central industry and local industry simultaneously, and develop large, medium and small enterprises simultaneously. Under the illumination of such a general line, the Chinese people have the confidence to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years or a shorter period, and build our country into a great socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    The current international situation is entirely favorable to the socialist camp, to the people of all countries striving for peace, democracy, national independence and social progress, and unfavorable to the imperialist countries. The East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind, and will continue to prevail over the West Wind. Socialism is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the socialist camp's struggle to defend world peace and safeguard the national independence of all countries has further enhanced the prestige of the socialist camp among the people of the world. In contrast, the war policies of the imperialist camp headed by the United States are being resolutely opposed by the peace-loving people of the world; the economic crisis currently encountered by imperialism further exposes the dying face of imperialism before the people of the world. However, imperialism is by no means willing to withdraw from the stage of history automatically. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against imperialism's continued war threats; at the same time, we must not have the slightest neglect of imperialism's policy of using modern revisionism to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and undermine the cause of socialism from within. The anti-Marxist-Leninist program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia recently is a concentrated manifestation of this modern revisionism. It was put forward to split the international communist movement, and precisely when the general crisis of capitalism is deepening and the paralyzing effect of the revisionism of the right-wing social democrats on the working class and the working masses is weakening, this program serves imperialism, especially American imperialism, as much as "giving charcoal in snowy weather". In order to defend Marxism-Leninism and consolidate the unity of the international communist movement and the socialist camp, we must resolutely smash this modern revisionism that serves the policy of American imperialism. We firmly believe that in today's unprecedented unity of the international communist ranks and the unprecedented development of the world people's struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism will inevitably be abandoned by the international working class, just like the old Bernsteinism!
    Comrades, I sincerely congratulate you on the complete success of your Congress and congratulate you on the completion of socialist construction.
    Now allow me to read to you the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to your Congress:
To all comrades of the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:
    On the occasion of the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends heartfelt and warm congratulations to your Congress, and through your Congress, to all Communist Party members and the people of Czechoslovakia.
    Your Congress is being held at a time when the working people of Czechoslovakia are enthusiastically striving to complete socialist construction.
    Now the socialist relations of production in Czechoslovakia have achieved a decisive advantage, socialist industry has greatly developed, agricultural production has increased, and the people's living standards have been greatly improved. The series of correct policies adopted by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to implement Leninism's national policy, to improve the communist ideological consciousness of the people, and to consolidate the people's democratic regime have also achieved remarkable results.
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak people have made significant contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, defending world peace, and supporting the independence and liberation movements of oppressed nations.
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party has always been consistently faithful to proletarian internationalism and has demonstrated an unwavering stance in repelling the anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracies of imperialism and in the struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Tito leading group.
    The Chinese Communist Party congratulates the Czechoslovak Communist Party on the great victory achieved by the general line of the new period formulated since the Ninth Congress.
    The Chinese Communist Party is pleased to see that the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia will prescribe various correct tasks and policies for the completion of socialist construction, and firmly believes that the Czechoslovak Communist Party, relying closely on the people, will surely be able to successfully achieve its goals, thereby consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, defending the cause of world peace, democracy, and social progress, and making significant contributions in the struggle to smash modern revisionism and safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism.
                    Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    祝捷共胜利地完成社会主义建设  共同努力坚决粉碎现代修正主义
    董必武同志在捷共代表大会上的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    我代表中国共产党和中国人民，谨向你们的代表大会，并通过你们的大会，向正在建设社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克的共产党员和全体劳动人民致以兄弟般的热烈的祝贺。
    你们党的第十一次代表大会，是在你们的具有历史意义的光荣的二月胜利十周年召开的。十年以来，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的正确领导下，通过捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的忘我劳动，你们的社会主义建设事业，已经取得了巨大的成就。从1948年到现在，你们的工业产量提高到三倍，使得捷克斯洛伐克在按人口平均的工业品产量方面，已经成为世界上最先进的国家之一；在农业方面，最近两年以来，社会主义的生产关系也已经取得了决定性的优势。捷克斯洛伐克共产党重视思想工作，它不倦地用马克思列宁主义教育人民，来提高人民的共产主义觉悟和改造知识分子。捷克斯洛伐克共产党还始终如一地关怀着人民的生活。随着工农业生产的不断发展，捷克斯洛伐克人民现在已经享受着很高的物质文化生活。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和捷克斯洛伐克政府，一贯地奉行列宁的和平共处的外交政策，为了保卫欧洲和世界和平，为了支援被压迫民族的独立解放运动，曾经进行了坚决的斗争，并且在这一方面作出了重大的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克共产党忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则，坚持以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，同破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的帝国主义反动派和以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义，进行了不调和的斗争。我们中国人民怀着十分高兴的心情，看到你们在建设社会主义事业和保卫世界和平事业中所取得的上述的一切成就，并且把这些成就，看作是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界和平力量增长的标志。
    你们的这次代表大会继不久之前提出的豪迈口号——在最短时间内，工业产品产量按人口平均赶上和超过最先进的资本主义国家——之后，又提出了要完成社会主义建设这一具有历史意义的口号，并且将为实现上述的伟大目的而制订出一系列政治、经济和思想工作方面的任务。中国共产党对于你们党的这种对自己的事业具有无限的信心和勇往直前的干劲，表示很大的钦佩，并且深信你们一定能够胜利地达成既定的目标。
    同捷克斯洛伐克人民有着深厚友谊的我们中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，也正在努力建设着我们的国家。我们已经相继地取得了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的决定性胜利。不久之前，我党举行了第八届全国代表大会第二次会议，又为我国人民确定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这条总路线的基本点是：调动一切积极因素，正确处理人民内部矛盾；巩固和发展社会主义的全民所有制和集体所有制，巩固无产阶级专政和无产阶级国际团结；在继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命；在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举；在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举。在这样的总路线的照耀之下，中国人民有信心在十五年内或更短的时期内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    目前的国际形势，完全有利于社会主义阵营，有利于争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会进步的各国人民，而不利于帝国主义国家。东风已经压倒了西风，而且将继续压倒西风。社会主义日益地深入人心，社会主义阵营为保卫世界和平，维护各国民族独立而进行的斗争，更加增强了社会主义阵营在世界人民中的威望。与此相反，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的战争政策，正日益遭到全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对；现时帝国主义所遭遇到的经济危机，在全世界人民面前，更加暴露了帝国主义的日暮途穷的面貌。但是帝国主义是绝不甘心自动地退出历史舞台的，对于帝国主义还在继续进行战争威胁，我们必须保持高度的警惕；同时，我们对于帝国主义利用现代修正主义，从我们内部来破坏社会主义阵营的团结和破坏社会主义事业的政策，更不能有丝毫的忽视。最近南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的反马克思列宁主义的纲领，就是这种现代修正主义的集中表现。它是为了分裂国际共产主义运动而提出来的，是恰恰在资本主义总危机加深的时候，在右翼社会党人的修正主义对工人阶级和劳动群众的麻痹作用日益减弱的时候提出来的，因而这个纲领对于帝国主义特别是美国帝国主义的效劳，等于“雪中送炭”。为了保卫马克思列宁主义，巩固国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结，我们必须坚决地粉碎这种为美帝国主义政策服务的现代修正主义。我们深信在国际共产主义队伍空前团结和世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争空前发展的今天，现代修正主义必然会像老伯恩斯坦主义一样，被国际工人阶级所抛弃！
    同志们，我衷心地祝贺你们代表大会的圆满成功，祝贺你们完成社会主义的建设。
    现在请允许我向你们宣读中国共产党中央委员会给你们代表大会的贺电：捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会全体同志们：
    际此捷克斯洛伐克共产党召开第十一次代表大会的时候，中国共产党中央委员会谨向你们的大会，并通过你们的大会，向捷克斯洛伐克全体共产党员和捷克斯洛伐克人民致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    你们的大会是在捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民热情高涨地为完成社会主义建设而奋斗的时候召开的。
    现在捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义生产关系已经取得了决定性的优势，社会主义工业有了很大的发展，农业生产有了增长，人民生活水平也已经大大提高，捷克斯洛伐克共产党为实现列宁主义的民族政策，为提高人民的共产主义思想觉悟，为巩固人民民主政权而采取的一系列正确的政策，也已经取得了卓著的成效。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和捷克斯洛伐克人民，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义，保卫世界和平和支援被压迫民族的独立解放运动作出了重大的贡献。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党始终一贯地忠实于无产阶级的国际主义。在击退帝国主义反苏反共的阴谋活动中，在反对以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义的斗争中表现了坚定不移的立场。
    中国共产党祝贺捷克斯洛伐克共产党从第九次代表大会以来所制订的新时期的总路线所取得的伟大胜利。
    中国共产党高兴地看到，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会将为完成社会主义建设而规定各种正确的任务和政策，并且深信捷克斯洛伐克共产党紧紧地依靠人民，一定能够胜利地实现自己的目标，从而对于巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，保卫世界和平、民主、社会进步的事业，以及在粉碎现代修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的斗争中，作出重大的贡献。
                    中国共产党中央委员会
                            1958年6月15日
