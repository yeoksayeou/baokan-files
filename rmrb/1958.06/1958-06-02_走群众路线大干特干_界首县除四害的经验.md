　　Launch a Vigorous Mass Movement
　　——Jieshou County's Experience in Eliminating the Four Pests
　　Yang Liu

　　Since Anhui Province issued the general mobilization order for eliminating the four pests on January 14th this year, Jieshou County has launched a massive, nationwide patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. After two months of hard work, the "four pests" have been basically eliminated. The main experiences of Jieshou County in eliminating the four pests are introduced as follows:

　　Guided by the Great Leap Forward Thought

　　The first experience is that the elimination of the four pests must be guided by the thought of the Great Leap Forward, and we must constantly struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas. When the Jieshou County Party Committee initially proposed a Great Leap Forward in eliminating the four pests, not everyone agreed. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas believed that there was no need for a Great Leap Forward in eliminating the four pests, others believed that the elimination of the four pests could not achieve a Great Leap Forward, and still others believed that the elimination of the four pests and other tasks could not all achieve a Great Leap Forward. They said: "Why make such a fuss about eliminating the four pests?"; "The four pests have existed since ancient times. Sparrows fly fast, rats burrow fiercely, and flies and mosquitoes have grandchildren every day and night. Who can eliminate them? This is simply telling a myth"; "There are so many tasks now, we are extremely busy. Engaging in production makes it impossible to eliminate the four pests, and eliminating the four pests makes it impossible to engage in production. If everything is to have a Great Leap Forward, unless we grow three heads and six arms." At that time, many comrades were constrained by these ideas. At the county party representative conference held on January 11th this year, through great debates and on-the-spot discussions of advanced models, various right-leaning conservative arguments about eliminating the four pests were thoroughly criticized. This enabled the comrades attending the meeting to deeply understand that a Great Leap Forward in eliminating the four pests was not only completely necessary but also completely achievable. After the masses were mobilized, the facts proved that eliminating the four pests could greatly leap forward. Therefore, the Jieshou County plan for eliminating the four pests was revised three times in succession, initially from five years to two years, then from two years to one year, and then from one year to five months.

　　Talk Extensively, Work Vigorously

　　The second experience is that the elimination of the four pests must be talked about extensively and worked on vigorously. The "four pests" are large in number, reproduce quickly, and are good at hiding. To completely eliminate them, the broad masses must be fully mobilized so that everyone hates the "four pests" and everyone takes action to eliminate them. So how did Jieshou County do it?

　　First, there was extensive publicity, mobilization, and talk to make everyone understand why the four pests should be eliminated. In the first half month or so of the campaign, four wired broadcast meetings were held in succession, with a total audience of more than 423,000 people. Forty-nine exhibitions were held, displaying crops ruined by sparrows, grain stolen and clothing damaged by rats, cartoons and wall charts of diseases spread by mosquitoes and flies, as well as a large number of captured four pests. More than 132,500 people were educated. Townships organized mass parades and demonstrations to march on the "four pests," with gongs and drums beating and banners waving. Everyone held tools for eliminating the four pests and carried a large number of "four pests" corpses. More than 87,500 people participated in the parades and demonstrations. Communes and teams held cadre meetings, Party member and Communist Youth League member meetings, and commune member meetings. Towns held street resident meetings. More than 1,120,000 people attended the meetings and received education. Street publicity was carried out during market days, reaching more than 97,000 people. Lectures on scientific and health knowledge centered on eliminating the "four pests" were held 345 times in various parts of the county, with more than 93,000 people attending. Through various forms of extensive publicity, the enthusiasm of everyone for eliminating the four pests was greatly boosted, and a magnificent and powerful high tide of eliminating the four pests was quickly set off throughout the county.

　　In the extensive publicity and mobilization of the masses to eliminate the four pests, it was even more important to universally mobilize the masses to talk about the evils of the "four pests" and calculate four accounts, namely: the account of grain wasted by sparrows and rats; the account of clothing damaged by rats; the account of the benefits of eliminating the "four pests," reducing diseases, and enhancing physical health; and the account of increased production through sanitation and increased fertilizer accumulation. Calculating these four accounts came from the masses and returned to the masses. It was a mass self-education method that was very vivid and powerful, quickly arousing people's hatred for the "four pests" and further strengthening their determination to eliminate them.

　　Second, there was a large search and encirclement of the "four pests," with nets spread everywhere to leave the "four pests" with no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth. Because the broad masses were mobilized, the "four pests" were immediately surrounded. More than 200,000 troops for eliminating the four pests formed rat-catching teams, sparrow-catching teams, fly and mosquito extermination teams, pupa-digging teams, and various commando groups, using more than 480,000 tools for eliminating the four pests, spread throughout the rooms, roofs, fields, forests, grass stacks and other corners. They adopted unified action at the same time and comprehensive search and suppression, forcing the "four pests" to be unable to move and quickly suffer devastating blows. At the most tense moment, the county's party and government leaders and the people of the county jointly carried out fifteen whole nights of surprise encirclement and suppression of the "four pests." Mass marches and searches, coupled with the mobile cooperation of scouts, sharpshooters, and snipers, left the "four pests" no chance to breathe. Wherever the "four pests" ran, they were eliminated.

　　Third, a major cleanup, relocation, washing, and mud brushing were carried out in terms of sanitation to ensure that everything was clean and there were no dead corners. A comprehensive and thorough cleanup was carried out indoors and outdoors, up and down, and in all dark corners. All beds and furniture such as basins and jars were generally relocated and washed. More than 90% of the houses in the county were mud-brushed inside and out. Most of them were also whitewashed with lime or white clay powder, and many families also put up ceilings and painted doors and windows. At the same time, more than 7,400 public toilets were newly built in the county, more than 62,000 private outdoor toilets and manure ponds in family courtyards were abolished, and more than 14,200 livestock pens were built, completely changing the past phenomenon of people without toilets and pigs without pens. In the past, the uneven sheep intestines paths in the villages were generally renovated into fish-ridge-style "hygienic roads," sewage ditches were generally cleaned up, and sewage pits and depressions were completely filled. Well platforms were generally added to the wells, and they were provided with fences, covers, and public water buckets.

　　Establish Points to Lead the Way, Contract at All Levels, Check and Compare

　　The third experience is to set up points at all levels, establish banners, use points to lead the way, and let a hundred flowers bloom; to contract at all levels and establish a responsibility system; and to earnestly grasp inspection and comparison. At the beginning of the campaign, the Jieshou County Party Committee closely grasped the typical example of the advanced village of Yangxiaozhai. Through various forms of publicity such as meetings, wired broadcasts, and cartoons, especially through organizing on-the-spot visits and opening on-site meetings, the advanced deeds of Yangxiaozhai were universally deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and a wave of "learning from Yangxiaozhai and catching up with Yangxiaozhai" was universally set off throughout the county. In order to make the experience of Yangxiaozhai blossom and bear fruit throughout the county, the Jieshou County Party Committee successively organized more than 3,000 people, including representatives of the county party representative conference, commune directors, and representatives of key townships, communes, and villages, to visit Yangxiaozhai Village, and held on-site meetings in Yangxiaozhai. More than 2,000 representatives were automatically sent to Yangxiaozhai by various townships and communes. While the county party committee grasped Yangxiaozhai, the various townships and communes cultivated their own key villages, first turning the key villages into the local "Yangxiaozhai," and establishing a clear banner for their townships and communes. In this way, one point drove many points, and many points drove the overall situation.

　　In terms of establishing a responsibility system, the county party committee, under the unified leadership and unified plan, stipulated a system of contracting at all levels, that is, members of the county party committee contracted to townships, township cadres contracted to communes, commune cadres contracted to teams, team cadres contracted to areas, and Party and Communist Youth League members contracted to households.

　　In terms of grasping inspection and comparison, in addition to the members of the county party committee dividing their work to carry out key inspections in various townships and communes, the main method was to regularly organize commune-level inspection groups composed mainly of township cadres and participated by cadres from various teams to carry out inspections in turn, and to organize representatives from various townships and communes to inspect each other. In addition, more than ten large inspection groups were formed by drawing county-level cadres to go deep into townships and communes to help with work while carrying out inspections. In the inspection, on the one hand, the focus was on grasping the advanced, setting an example, and spreading experience in a timely manner. On the other hand, the focus was on grasping the backward, breaking through "dead corners," and vigorously helping the backward to catch up with the advanced units. Inspection and comparison were mostly closely combined, inspecting while comparing, and organizing mutual comparison when organizing mutual inspection. Wanglieqiao Township was originally slow in eliminating the four pests, but after ten inspections and ten comparisons throughout the township, it jumped to become an advanced unit.

　　Combine Pest Elimination with Benefit Creation

　　The fourth experience is to closely combine pest elimination with benefit creation, and to effectively eliminate the four pests to serve production and run sanitation work diligently and thriftily.

　　The Jieshou County Party Committee implemented these two principles from the beginning of the campaign in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. On the issue of eliminating the four pests to serve production, on the one hand, close attention was paid to combining pest elimination with benefit creation, and on the other hand, attention was paid to simultaneously leaping forward in eliminating the four pests and various tasks to ensure that production and sanitation were not neglected.

　　In order to enable the simultaneous leap forward in eliminating the four pests and various tasks, Jieshou County paid special attention to the arrangement of labor and time. In terms of labor arrangement, emphasis was placed on organizing elderly teams, youth teams, and children's teams to eliminate the four pests and clean up the sanitation. They served as the standing army for eliminating the four pests and carrying out sanitation work. Young and middle-aged people generally participated in the movement to eliminate the four pests on the principle of not occupying production time. Only a small number of sparrow-shooting shooters were assigned to young and middle-aged people. In terms of time arrangement, emphasis was placed on "squeezing time from busy schedules," mainly using the morning, the time before and after lunch, and the evening to eliminate the four pests and carry out sanitation work. Generally, production time was not occupied.

　　In terms of running sanitation diligently and thriftily, the main method was to mobilize the masses to come up with various ways to create tools for eliminating the four pests that were both effective and did not cost money. Among the more than 480,000 tools for eliminating the four pests used throughout the county, most of them were made by the masses themselves using local materials, and no money was used at all.

　　Pay Attention to Tactics and Improve Technology

　　The fifth experience is that the elimination of the four pests must pay attention to tactics and constantly improve technology.

　　Jieshou County paid attention to this issue relatively early. Not long after the campaign began, it focused on grasping tools, grasping organization, and grasping the exchange of experience. In terms of grasping tools, the main emphasis was on everyone starting together, everyone having tools, and nets spread everywhere. If one did not know how to make tools for eliminating the four pests, one would ask those who knew how to make them for help. If one did not know how to use tools for eliminating the four pests, one would ask those who knew how to use them to help learn. "Zhuge Liang meetings" and "expert meetings" were opened, with one person teaching ten people, and ten people teaching a hundred people. At the beginning, the Red Star Third Cooperative of Yanshi Township lacked tools for eliminating the four pests, so it specially drew twenty-six people to help the masses support the blanks for catching rats. Four hundred and fifty-two blanks were supported in one night, plus a total of 1,304 other tools. Within two days, an average of more than four tools per household was achieved. In terms of grasping organization, in addition to organizing various types of soldiers and combat teams according to the different ages and skills of each person and in response to the characteristics of the four pests, special attention was paid to equipping each combat group with experienced people in eliminating the four pests as the backbone, with veterans leading new recruits and training new recruits. Attention was also paid to selecting experts in eliminating the four pests and sharpshooters to form various commando groups. Therefore, a strong offensive was launched against the "four pests" from the very beginning.

　　Combine Surprise Attacks with Regularization

　　The sixth experience is that eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene must be closely combined with surprise attacks and regularization. In the process of campaign development, Jieshou County deeply realized that in order to completely eliminate the "four pests" and maintain regular cleanliness, in addition to carrying out surprise attacks, it is necessary to adhere to regularization and systematization. Leaders at all levels and grassroots units have generally paid attention to this issue. Their practices are: (1) Establish health groups of three to five people in street resident groups and production teams of agricultural cooperatives to be responsible for leading and promoting the regular sanitation work of their units. In some places, the production team leader or production group leader is the health group leader. (2) Establish inspection groups of three to seven people in townships, communes, production teams, and street resident committees to be responsible for regularly inspecting the elimination of the four pests and sanitation conditions, and to evaluate advanced units and backward units. (3) After deliberation and discussion, each unit and each household formulated their own patriotic health covenants. Many places also formulated individual health covenants. (4) Establish a system. The systems established by various grassroots units include a system of sweeping indoors and outdoors twice a day, a major cleanup every ten days or half a month, a small inspection by the production team every one or two days, and a major inspection by the township commune every seven to ten days. (5) Environmental sanitation and the cleanliness of public places are the responsibility of designated personnel, mainly elderly people and children who are assigned to take care of areas. (6) Provide reasonable labor remuneration. During the big surprise attack of the four pests elimination movement, there was generally no remuneration for the general mobilization of the people, but in the regular four pests elimination work after the surprise attack, a certain remuneration was given to encourage their enthusiasm. (7) Through various forms of publicity and education, regularly carry out in-depth education on eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, so that everyone consciously pays attention to eliminating the four pests at any time and develops the habit of being clean and hygienic. This is the main guarantee for adhering to regularization and systematization. In some places, medical workers from health clinics and joint clinics regularly give health lessons to publicize and explain health knowledge and basic knowledge of disease prevention, which has played a significant role in promoting the regularization and systematization of health work.

　　走群众路线大干特干
　　——界首县除四害的经验
　　杨柳
    安徽省界首县自今年1月14日省发布除四害总动员令起，在全县范围内展开了全民性的轰轰烈烈的以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，经过两个月的苦战，已基本上消灭了“四害”。现将界首县消灭四害的一些主要经验介绍如下：
    以大跃进为指导思想
    第一个经验，就是除四害要以大跃进为指导思想，不断同右倾保守思想作斗争。界首县委一开始提出除四害要大跃进，并不是每一个人都赞成，有右倾保守思想的人，一则认为除四害不必大跃进，二则认为除四害不能大跃进，三则认为除四害和其他各项任务不能全面大跃进。他们说：“像除四害这样的事情，何必兴师动众，大动干戈”；“四害自古以来就有，麻雀飞得快，老鼠钻得凶，苍蝇蚊子一天一夜见重孙，谁能把它消灭掉呢？这简直是在说神话”；“现在任务多，忙得要命，搞生产就不能除四害，除四害就不能搞生产，样样都要大跃进，除非长了三头六臂”。当时不少同志就是受了这些思想的束缚。在今年1月11日召开的县党代表大会上，通过大辩论和参观先进典型，就地展开讨论的方法，彻底批判了有关除四害的各种各样的右倾保守论调，使到会同志深刻地认识到除四害不仅完全有必要大跃进，而且也完全能够做到大跃进。当群众发动起来以后，事实说明了除四害可以大大飞跃前进。因此界首县的除四害规划连续修改三次，开始由五年改为二年，后又由二年改为一年，接着又由一年改为五个月。
    大讲特讲　大干特干
    第二个经验，就是除四害一定要大讲特讲，大干特干。“四害”数量大，繁殖快，并善于潜藏，要将其彻底消灭，就一定要将广大群众充分发动起来，做到人人仇视“四害”，人人动手消灭“四害”。这就要求把除四害当作一件大事来做，不能当作一件小事来做。界首县是怎样做的呢？
    首先是大宣传，大动员，大讲特讲，使人人懂得为什么要除四害。在运动开始的半个多月时间内，连续举行过四次有线广播大会，听众达四十二万三千多人次。举办了四十九处展览会，展览被麻雀糟蹋过的庄稼、老鼠偷盗的粮食和咬坏的衣物，蚊蝇传染疾病的连环画和挂图等以及捕获的大量四害，受教育的达十三万二千五百多人次。乡乡组织了群众性的向“四害”大进军的游行示威，锣鼓喧天，旗幡招展，人人手执除四害的工具，并抬着大批的“四害”尸体，参加游行示威的达八万七千五百多人。社社队队召开了干部会、党员、团员会、社员大会，城镇召开了街道居民大会，参加会议受教育的达一百一十二万余人次。在逢集时进行街道宣传，听到宣传的达九万七千余人。以消灭“四害”为中心的科学卫生常识讲座，在全县各地先后举办三百四十五次，听讲的达九万三千多人。通过各种形式的大宣传，鼓足了每一个人的除四害干劲，迅速在全县范围内掀起了一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的除四害高潮。
    在对群众进行除四害的大宣传大动员中，更重要的是普遍发动群众讲述“四害”的罪恶，算四笔账，即是：麻雀、老鼠糟蹋粮食账；老鼠损坏衣物账；消灭“四害”，减少疾病，增强身体健康的好处账；搞卫生多积肥的增产账。算这四笔账，是从群众中来到群众中去，是群众性的自我教育方法，非常生动有力，迅速激起了人们对于“四害”的仇恨心和更加坚定了除四害的决心。
    其次是对“四害”进行大搜索，大围剿，到处撒下天罗地网，要“四害”上天无路，入地无门。由于广大群众都被发动起来，“四害”立即陷入重重包围，二十余万除四害大军，分别组成了捕鼠队，捕雀队、灭蝇灭蚊队、挖蛹队和各种突击小组，使用着四十八万多件除四害工具，遍布在室内、屋顶、田野、树林、草堆等各个角落，并采取在同一时间内统一行动，全面搜剿，迫使“四害”寸步难行，迅速遭到毁灭性打击。在最紧张的时刻，县的党政领导同志和全县人民一道，曾先后对“四害”突击围剿十五个整夜。群众性的大进军、大搜剿，加上侦察兵、神枪手、狙击手的机动配合，就使得“四害”一点喘息的机会都没有，“四害”跑到哪里，即被消灭在哪里。
    第三是在清洁卫生方面进行了大扫除，大搬家，大洗刷、大泥刷，做到处处干净，没有死角。室内室外、上上下下和一切阴暗角落，都进行了全面的彻底的大扫除；室内所有的床铺和盆盆罐罐等家具，普遍进行了一次大搬家，大洗刷。全县90％以上的房屋，里里外外都泥刷了一遍。其中大部分并用石灰或白土粉了一次，许多人家还扎了顶棚，漆染了门窗。与此同时，全县还新建了七千四百多个公共厕所，取消了六万二千多个私人露天厕所和家庭院内的粪池，修建了一万四千二百多处牲畜圈栏，彻底改变了过去的那种人无厕所猪无圈的现象。过去村庄内高凹不平的羊肠小路，已普遍翻修成鱼脊式的“卫生大路”，污水沟已普遍进行清理，污水坑洼已全部填平。水井普遍加筑了井台，并做到有栏有盖有公用水桶。
    以点带面　层层包干　检查评比
    第三个经验，就是要层层设点，树立旗帜，以点带面，四面开花；要层层包干，建立责任制；要切实抓检查，抓评比。运动一开始时，界首县委即紧紧抓住了杨小寨这个先进村的典型，通过会议、有线广播、连环画等各种宣传形式，特别是通过组织实地参观访问、开现场会议等形式，使杨小寨的先进事迹，普遍深入人心，在全县范围内普遍掀起了“学习杨小寨，赶上杨小寨”的热潮。界首县委为使杨小寨的经验在全县开花结果，曾先后组织县党代表大会的代表，社主任、各重点乡社村的代表等三千多人到杨小寨村参观，并在杨小寨召开了现场会议，各乡、社自动派到杨小寨参观的代表达二千多人。在县委抓杨小寨的同时，各乡、社都培养了自己的重点村，首先使重点村变成当地的“杨小寨”，给本乡本社树立了鲜明的旗帜，这样就由一点带动了许多点，又由许多点带动了全面。
    在建立责任制方面，县委在统一领导统一计划下，规定了层层包干的制度，即县委委员分头包乡，乡干部分头包社，社干部分头包队，队干部包片，党团员包户。
    在抓检查评比方面，除了县委委员分工到各乡社作重点检查外，主要是定期组织以乡干部为主吸收各队干部参加的社一级检查组，分片轮番检查，组织各乡各社派代表互相检查。另外，还两次抽调县直机关干部组成十多个大检查组深入乡社边帮助工作边检查。在检查中一方面是抓先进，做样子，及时传播经验，一方面是抓落后，突破“死角”，大力帮助落后赶上先进单位。检查和评比，大多是密切结合进行，边检查边评比，组织相互检查时就组织相互评比。王烈桥乡原来除四害行动迟缓，经过全乡十查十比之后，就一跃而为先进单位。
    除害和兴利结合
    第四个经验，就是要除害和兴利密切结合，切实做到除四害为生产服务和勤俭办卫生工作。
    界首县委从运动开始即根据中央和省委指示精神，贯彻了这两个原则。在除四害为生产服务的问题上，一方面密切注意除害和兴利相结合，一方面注意除四害和各项工作同时跃进，做到生产、卫生两不误。
    为使除四害和各项工作同时跃进，界首县特别注意了劳力和时间的安排问题。在劳力安排上，强调组织除四害和打扫卫生的老年队、少年队、儿童队，由他们担任除四害和搞卫生的常备军，青年壮年一般地都是在不占用生产时间的原则下参加除四害运动，只有为数不多的打麻雀的射击手，才由青壮年担任。在时间安排上，强调“忙里抽闲”，主要是利用早晨、午饭前后和夜晚的时间除四害搞卫生，一般地都不占用生产时间。
    在勤俭办卫生方面，主要是发动群众想出各种办法创造出既有效又不要花钱的除四害工具。在全县使用的四十八万多件除四害工具中，绝大部分都是群众就地取材自制的，根本没有用到花钱。
    讲究战术　提高技术
    第五个经验，就是除四害要讲究战术，不断提高技术。
    界首县对这个问题注意得比较早，运动开始不久，即着重抓工具，抓组织，抓交流经验。在抓工具方面，主要是强调人人齐动手，个个有工具，到处撒下天罗地网。自己不会制除四害工具的，就请会的人帮助制，不会用除四害工具的，就请会的人帮助学会用，开“诸葛亮会”“能手会”，一传十，十传百。碾石乡红星三社一开始除四害工具很缺乏，就专门抽了二十六个人帮助群众支吊坯捕鼠，一夜就支了四百五十二个吊坯，加上其他工具一共搞了一千三百零四件，在两天内即做到平均每户有四件以上工具。在抓组织方面，除了根据各个人的年龄和技术的不同，针对四害的特点，分别组织各种不同的兵种和战斗队伍外，特别注意了在各个战斗小组内配备对除四害有经验的人为骨干，要老兵领带新兵，训练新兵。并注意挑选除四害能手和神枪手组成各种突击小组。因此，一开始对“四害”形成强有力的攻势。
    突击和经常化结合
    第六个经验，就是除四害、讲卫生要做到突击和经常化紧密结合。界首县在运动发展过程中深深体会到，要彻底消灭“四害”，并经常保持清洁卫生，除了搞突击运动外，还一定要坚持经常化、制度化。各级领导和各基层单位已普遍注意了这个问题。它们的做法是：（1）在街道居民小组和农业社的生产队内建立三人至五人的卫生小组，负责领导和推动本单位的经常性的卫生工作，有些地方生产队长或生产组长就是卫生组长。（2）在乡、社、生产队和街道居民委员会建立三人至七人的检查组，负责定期检查除四害和清洁卫生状况，并评定先进单位和落后单位。（3）经过酝酿讨论，由各单位和各户自己制订爱国卫生公约，许多地方还做到了制订单项卫生公约。（4）建立制度，各基层单位已建立的制度有室内外一天两扫制，十天或半个月一次大扫除，生产队一天或两三天一小查，乡社七天至十天一大查等各项制度。（5）环境卫生和公共场所的清洁卫生有专人负责，主要有老年人和少年儿童分片包干。（6）合理地给予劳动报酬。除四害运动在大突击时，一般的全民动员没有什么报酬，但在突击之后的经常性的除四害工作，则给予一定报酬，以鼓励其积极性。（7）通过各种宣传教育形式，经常地深入进行除四害讲卫生教育，使每个人都自觉地随时注意除四害，并养成爱清洁讲卫生的习惯，这是坚持经常化、制度化的主要保证。有些地方还由卫生所和联合诊所的医务工作者定期上卫生课，宣传讲解卫生常识和预防疾病的基本知识，对于推动卫生工作经常化、制度化起了很大作用。
