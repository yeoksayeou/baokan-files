Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st (TASS dispatch): A mass demonstration was held in Osaka, Japan's second largest city, on May 31st, protesting against the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal arrest of leaders of the All-Communications Industry Workers' Union. The demonstration was organized by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

Beginning at the end of April, the Kishi Nobusuke government has persecuted leaders and members of the All-Communications Industry Workers' Union who participated in the spring struggle through dismissals, suspensions, and large-scale arrests.

According to the "Asahi Shimbun," this was the first large-scale and combative demonstration in Osaka since 1952.
