    The Second International Revisionism
    Question: Recently, while reading articles criticizing the revisionism of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, I saw a sentence that said: Modern revisionism is a continuation and development of the Second International revisionism. Could you please explain how the Second International was established and how it was usurped by revisionists?
                Reader Gu Zumin
    Answer: The Second International was founded in Paris in 1889. The first congress was attended by 893 delegates from 22 countries in Europe and the Americas. At that time, it was a period of peaceful development of capitalism, and the historical task presented to the proletariat of all countries was to accumulate and prepare their strength. The historical mission of the Second International was to organize and educate the working class and develop the workers' movement in a broad way. Therefore, Lenin called the Second International "an international organization of the proletarian movement which is expanding widely."
    The establishment of the Second International was inseparable from the initiative and influence of Engels. In order to safeguard the revolutionary direction of the Second International, Engels carried out a resolute struggle against opportunism, enabling the Second International to "do the meaningful work that history demanded." (Lenin)
    After Engels' death (1895), the revisionist forces headed by Bernstein in the Second International greatly strengthened. As capitalism entered the stage of imperialism and the proletarian revolutionary movement developed increasingly, the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie tried their best to buy over the labor aristocracy and use the revisionist forces of the Second International to disintegrate the workers' movement. The revisionist forces of the Second International gradually gained a dominant position. They castrated the revolutionary content of Marxism, replacing the theory of proletarian revolution with the fallacies of class coordination and "peaceful growth of capitalism into socialism," denied the leadership of the proletariat in the revolution, threw the fundamental issue of proletarian political power to the winds, and openly embarked on the opportunist road of betraying the proletariat.
    However, Lenin founded a new type of truly Marxist party—the Russian Bolshevik Party, raised the clear banner against domestic and international revisionism, broke with the Second International revisionism, carried out great work in defending and developing Marxism, expounded the theory of imperialism and the strategy and tactics of revolution in the stage of imperialism, and practically guided the international proletarian revolutionary movement onto the correct track. Lenin attended the congresses of the Second International twice, in 1907 and 1910, and carried out a powerful struggle against revisionism. Lenin resolutely opposed the Second International revisionists' betrayal stance of supporting imperialist wars under the slogan of "defending the motherland." The resolution against war that he proposed and passed at the Second International Stuttgart Congress in 1907 became the core part of the anti-war declaration passed by the Second International Extraordinary Congress held in Basel in 1912. The leadership of the Second International—the revisionist forces—abandoned the Basel Declaration, openly threw themselves into the embrace of imperialism, became ardent supporters of the First World War, and thus caused the Second International to collapse in 1914. However, Lenin insisted on the revolutionary struggle of turning imperialist war into civil war, led the Russian socialist revolution, and finally achieved the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, and established the Third International in 1919. The Third International inherited the revolutionary traditions of the First International established by Marx and Engels and the positive achievements of the work of the Second International, and became the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism.

    第二国际修正主义
    问：最近在阅读批判南共修正主义的文章中，看到有这样一句话：现代修正主义是第二国际修正主义的继续发展。请问第二国际是怎样建立的？又怎样被修正主义者所篡夺的？
                读者　顾祖民
    答：第二国际，是1889年在巴黎成立的。出席第一次代表大会的有来自欧洲和美洲二十二个国家的八百九十三名代表。那时正是资本主义和平发展的时期，历史向各国无产阶级提出来的任务是储蓄和准备自己的力量，而第二国际的历史使命，就是组织和教育工人阶级，向宽广的方面发展工人运动。所以，列宁把第二国际称为“一个正在广泛扩大着的无产阶级运动的国际组织”。
    第二国际的成立，是同恩格斯的创议和影响分不开的。恩格斯为维护第二国际的革命方针，对机会主义进行了坚决的斗争，使第二国际“作了历史上必须的有意义的工作。”（列宁）
    恩格斯逝世（1895年）后，第二国际中以伯恩斯坦为首的修正主义势力大大加强了。随着资本主义转入帝国主义阶段，无产阶级革命运动日益发展，资产阶级反动势力竭力收买工人贵族，利用第二国际修正主义势力来瓦解工人运动。第二国际修正主义势力逐步取得了统治地位，他们阉割马克思主义的革命内容，以阶级协调和“资本主义和平长入社会主义”的谬论代替无产阶级革命的理论，否认无产阶级在革命中的领导权，把无产阶级当政的根本问题抛在九霄云外，公开地走上背叛无产阶级的机会主义道路。
    但列宁创建了真正马克思主义的新型政党——俄国布尔什维克党，高举了反对国内国际修正主义的鲜明旗帜，同第二国际修正主义决裂，进行了捍卫和发展马克思主义的巨大工作，阐明了关于帝国主义的理论和在帝国主义阶段的革命的战略和策略，并在实践上把国际无产阶级革命运动导向正确的轨道。列宁在1907和1910年两次出席了第二国际的代表大会，对修正主义进行了有力的斗争。列宁坚决反对第二国际修正主义在“保卫祖国”的口号下拥护帝国主义战争的背叛立场，他在1907年第二国际斯图加特代表大会上提出并获得通过的反对战争的决议案，成了1912年在巴塞尔举行的第二国际临时代表大会通过的反战宣言的核心部分。第二国际的领导力量——修正主义势力背弃了巴塞尔宣言，公开投入帝国主义的怀抱，成为第一次世界大战的狂热的支持者，从而使第二国际在1914年宣告崩溃。但列宁坚持变帝国主义战争为国内战争的革命斗争，领导了俄国社会主义革命，终于取得了十月社会主义革命的胜利，并在1919年建立了第三国际。第三国际继承了马克思、恩格斯所成立的第一国际的革命传统和第二国际工作的积极成果，成了马克思列宁主义的旗手。
