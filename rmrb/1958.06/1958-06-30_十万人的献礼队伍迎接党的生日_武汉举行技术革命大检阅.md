(Reported by our Wuhan correspondent on June 29th) The people of Wuhan launched a grand gift-giving activity to the Party today, using the new achievements of the rectification movement and the technical and cultural revolutions to welcome the Party's birthday.

At a little after six o'clock in the morning, a gift-giving procession of more than 100,000 people, holding red flags high, set out from all directions towards the gift-receiving platform in front of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Palace. Many units reported to the Party on the tremendous changes that had taken place after the rectification movement, using poems, cartoons, and various artistic forms. More units carried their new products, newly created objects, models, and charts to present as gifts to the Party.

The rectification movement of more than a year has transformed the work style of leading cadres in more than 80% of the units in Wuhan. Many factories and enterprises have also established a system for workers to participate in management, and the work outlook and social atmosphere have been completely renewed. Before the fourth quarter of last year, the Hongxing Weaving Factory suffered from confused thinking among its employees and lax labor discipline, resulting in serious production waste and monthly losses. In the rectification movement, they launched a campaign to compete in being advanced, thrifty, and hardworking, and implemented systems such as decentralization of power, cadres participating in production, and workers participating in management, which greatly changed the factory's appearance. From the first quarter, it began to turn from losses to profits. In the past, backward workers also entered the ranks of the advanced in batches. The number of backward masses in Wuhan Power Plant No. 2 has been reduced from 20% to 2%.

The various objects and models in today's gift-giving procession fully demonstrate that, encouraged by the general line of socialist construction, workers are liberating their minds, breaking superstitions, and bravely marching towards technology. A brand-new "Red Flag" car appeared in the gift-giving procession, which was just successfully trial-produced by the workers of the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory yesterday. Six months ago, the people of Wuhan did not dare to imagine that the city could produce cars, but in the second half of the year, the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory alone is preparing to produce 300 cars. Textile system workers, who in the past could only spin up to 42-count yarn, also successfully trial-produced 400-count high-grade yarn in less than a month without combing machines. The inventions, technical innovations, and improved operating methods of the city's workers have reached more than 20,000 items. Since June, there have been an average of 230 items every day. A new situation of everyone innovating and everything innovating has emerged in many factories and mining enterprises. Many factories and construction sites have leaped from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization. In the past six months, more than 1,000 new products have been successfully trial-produced in the city, and the quality of more than 90 of them has reached or exceeded the advanced level in the country. The total output value of Wuhan's local industry in the second quarter increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year.

Today, the gift-receiving platform received thousands upon thousands of letters of determination. The workers expressed to the Party: On the basis of this victory, we must further carry out the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, and march along the general line of socialist construction.

    十万人的献礼队伍迎接党的生日
    武汉举行技术革命大检阅
    本报武汉29日电　武汉市人民在今天开展了盛大的向党献礼活动，他们用整风运动和技术革命、文化革命的新成就迎接党的生日。
    清晨六点多钟，由十万多人组成的献礼队伍就高举着红旗，从四面八方向设在中苏友好宫前的献礼台进发。许多单位都用诗歌、漫画和各种文艺形式，向党汇报他们经过整风运动所起的巨大变化。更多的单位抬着他们的新产品、新创造的实物、模型和图表，来向党献礼。
    一年多的整风运动，使武汉市80％以上单位的领导干部都转变了作风。很多工厂企业还建立了工人参加管理的制度，工作面貌和社会风气都焕然一新。鸿兴织布厂在去年第四季度以前，职工思想混乱，劳动纪律松弛，因此生产浪费严重，月月赔本。他们在整风中展开了比先进、比勤俭、比干劲的运动，并实行权力下放、干部参加生产、工人参加管理等制度，使工厂的面貌大大改变，从第一季度就开始由赔本转向盈余。过去思想落后的工人也成批进入先进行列。武汉动力二厂的后进群众已经由20％降低到2％。
    今天献礼队伍中的各种实物和模型，充分表明了职工在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，解放思想，破除迷信，正在勇敢地向技术进军。在献礼队伍里出现了一辆崭新的“红旗”牌汽车，这是武汉汽车配件厂职工昨天才试制成功的。在半年前武汉人民还不敢想像本市能够生产汽车，但下半年只武汉汽车配件厂就准备生产三百辆。过去最高只纺过四十二支纱的纺织系统职工，也在没有精梳机设备的情况下，不到一个月就试制成功了四百支高级纱。全市职工的发明创造、技术革新和改进操作方法，已达两万多项。从6月份以来，平均每天就有二百三十项。很多厂矿企业都出现了人人革新、事事革新的新局面。很多工厂和工地都由手工操作跃进到半机械化和机械化。半年来，全市试制成功的新产品有一千多种，其中有九十多种的质量已达到和超过了国内的先进水平。武汉市地方工业第二季度总产值比去年同期增长了40％以上。
    献礼台上今天收到了千千万万的决心书。职工们向党表示：要在这胜利的基础上，进一步开展技术革命和文化革命，沿着社会主义建设总路线迈进。
