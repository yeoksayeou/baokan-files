    New Discovery on the Overwintering Habits of the Brown Planthopper
    ——A Record of the Creative Research Work of Young Technician Wang Zhihai
    By Our Correspondent Kuang Lu'an

    Wang Zhihai, a young technician at the Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, creatively discovered the overwintering stage of the rice pest, the brown planthopper, breaking the conventional idea of scientific and technical personnel who blindly believe in books, and solving a problem that a famous Japanese entomologist had been studying for fourteen years without solving. This has made a significant contribution to mastering the prediction and forecasting of this rice pest and carrying out large-scale prevention and control work.
    The brown planthopper is a common and devastating pest in the southern rice-producing areas. Farmers in Hunan sometimes call it "fire midge." Last year, in Yizhang County, swarms of brown planthoppers clustered at the lower part of the rice plants, causing entire fields of rice to fall and rot. The county's rice production decreased by more than 13 million jin, more than doubling the reduction caused by the unprecedented drought of 1956. Although there are methods for controlling this pest, the overwintering stage of the pest had not been determined in scientific research, making it impossible to carry out comprehensive and effective control work. The Japanese entomologist Tojichi Murata studied it for fourteen years and only concluded that it might be overwintering as an adult or a larva. This problem, which many scientists at home and abroad had not solved in books and laboratories, was finally solved by Wang Zhihai after two years of field searching, coupled with his own bold assumptions and research experiments.
    Wang Zhihai is now only a twenty-three-year-old young Communist Party member. He attended school for two years as a child, and from the age of twelve, he took care of cattle for landlords, and later worked as an apprentice and a hired worker for rich peasants. In 1953, he joined the animal husbandry team of the provincial farm as a worker, and in 1954 he was transferred to the Plant Protection Department of the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences as a technician. At first, Wang Zhihai really knew nothing about agricultural science and technology, and could not even understand ordinary agricultural books. When the department needed to investigate insects in the field, he carried a box and followed them to the fields and ditches to find them. In order to find a certain insect, he could go hungry without going home for dinner; he could kneel by the ditch or on the edge of the field, staring at the grass for half an hour without moving; on rainy days, he would bring a sack to pad himself and sleep on it to observe carefully; sometimes when looking for insects by the ditch, he would even soak his hair in the water.
    The Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences began its research on the brown planthopper in the winter of 1954. In that year, more than 100 mu of land in the third work area of the institute were damaged by the brown planthopper, resulting in serious production reductions, with some fields yielding nothing, with dozens to more than 100 brown planthoppers on one rice plant. Wang Zhihai witnessed the harm caused by this pest and felt extremely sad. Soon, the institute decided to investigate and study this pest. Lei Huizhi, the deputy director who had been engaged in plant protection scientific research for twelve years, led Wang Zhihai to take on this research task. However, this pest could not be found once the severe winter arrived. In order to find the brown planthopper, they searched every corner of the surrounding villages throughout the winter, until May 1955, when they caught a few larvae in the green rice paddies and established a fixed observation point. They observed this observation point every five days and conducted investigations. They found that there were still adults in December, but after several heavy snows and freezes from the end of December to the beginning of January 1956, the insects disappeared without a trace. At that time, Director Lei Huizhi still believed that the conclusion reached by the famous Japanese entomologist Tojichi Murata after fourteen years of research, that "it may overwinter as an adult or a larva," was correct, so she still asked Wang Zhihai to find the insects. Wang Zhihai searched for more than ten days in this snowy and icy world, coming and going in the wind and rain, but found nothing. One day, Wang Zhihai came to the place where he had found insects before, staring at the floating grass by the ditch in a daze. He thought to himself: These insects were there before the snow, but disappeared after the snow. If they overwintered as adults or larvae, they would have to have a place to settle down, right? He raised a new question for himself: Could it be that they overwinter as eggs? If so, where could he find the eggs? Adults are only as small as lice, so the eggs would be even harder to find.
    In order to answer the new question he raised, he believed that he could completely abandon the method of searching in the wild and adopt the method of doing experiments. He recalled that a few days before the snowfall, many adults were still in the floating grass, and this insect grew in the hot rice paddies. If he transplanted these floating grasses into the insect-rearing room and increased the temperature to allow the eggs to hatch, wouldn't he be able to see if they overwintered as eggs? Thinking of this, he ran to the office as if he had found a treasure and told Director Lei his thoughts. His suggestion was supported by the leadership, and everyone encouraged him to try it out according to his own ideas. Wang Zhihai pulled some floating grass from the original observation site and transplanted it into the greenhouse. He used many methods to increase the temperature and humidity of the greenhouse, and he stayed by its side to guard it. About ten days later, he discovered the first larva. Wang Zhihai was so happy that he called Director Lei to come and see. Director Lei said: "The books say that they overwinter as adults or larvae. Now there is only one insect, and there is no certainty that they overwinter as eggs." Three or four days later, a large number of larvae appeared. Only then was it confirmed that Wang Zhihai's idea was correct, and the secret of overwintering of this pest was revealed by Wang Zhihai.
    After observing the winter of 1957, Wang Zhihai continued to study his discovery in 1956, further confirmed that conclusion, and found the law of overwintering of this pest. After the harvest of the mid-season rice, they migrate to the weeds in the ditches and continue to reproduce. After the severe cold, they lay their eggs in the weeds to overwinter. The discovery of this overwintering pest provided a basis for fundamentally carrying out large-scale prevention and control work. At the Central China Rice Insect Professional Conference in February of this year and the National Rice Pest Prediction and Forecasting Conference in November of last year, Wang Zhihai's research findings were valued by scientists across the country, and a national brown planthopper prediction and forecasting plan was formulated at the meeting. Starting this year, the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has designated Yizhang County as the key area for further research on the prevention and control of the brown planthopper, and Plant Protection Department Director Lei Huizhi has led a working group to carry out large-scale prevention and control work there.
    Recently, someone asked Wang Zhihai: "Why did you think of things that experts didn't think of?" He said: "The main reason is that I was not confused by the conclusions of Japanese scientists. I spent a lot of time in the fields, and this method was inspired by the fields."

    “褐飞虱”越冬规律的新发现
    ——记青年技工王治海的创造性研究工作
    本报记者  邝麓安
    湖南省农业科学研究所的一位青年技工王治海，创造性地发现了水稻害虫褐飞虱的越冬虫态，打破了一般科学技术人员迷信书本的观念，解决了日本著名昆虫学家研究十四年还没有解决的问题。对掌握这种水稻虫害的预测预报和进行大面积的防治工作，作出重大贡献。
    褐飞虱是南方水稻产区普遍发生并带有毁灭性的一种害虫。湖南农民有的叫做“火蠓子”。去年宜章县就因褐飞虱群集禾丛下部为害，使成片的稻株倒伏烂掉。全县减产稻谷一千三百多万斤。比1956年百年未有的旱灾减产还增加一倍。对这种害虫的防治办法是有的，但过去在科学研究上一直没有掌握这种害虫的越冬虫态，因此不能进行全面有效的防治工作。日本昆虫专家村田藤七研究了十四年也只说可能是成虫或幼虫过冬。这一个为国内外许多科学家在书本上和实验室里没有解决的问题，现在却给王治海在两年的田间搜索，加上自己大胆设想进行研究实验以后，终于把它解决了。
    王治海现在只不过是一个二十三岁的青年共产党员。他小时候曾读过两年书，十二岁起就给地主看牛，以后又当过学徒、给富农当雇工。1953年才到省农场畜耕队里当工人，1954年调到省农业科学研究所植保系当技工。开始，王治海对农业科学技术可真是一窍不通，连普通的农业书籍都看不懂。系里要到野外调查虫子，他背着个箱子，跟着一起到田垅里、山沟里去找。为了找到某种虫子，他可以饿着肚子不回家吃饭；可以跪在沟边、田埂上望着草丛，呆上半小时不动；下雨天就带个麻袋子垫着，睡在上面仔细观察；有时在水沟边找虫时，竟把头发都浸到水里去了。
    湖南省农业科学研究所对褐飞虱的研究，是从1954年冬天开始的。就在这年，所里第三工区百多亩田被褐飞虱所害，严重减产，有的颗粒无收，一根禾有几十到百多个褐飞虱。王治海亲眼看到了这种虫害的危害性，心里难过极了。不久，所里就确定了要对这种害虫进行调查研究。干过十二年植保科学研究工作的雷惠质副主任领着王治海担起了这个研究的担子。可是这种害虫一到严冬就看不到了。他们为了找褐飞虱虫子，整个冬天走遍了周围几个乡的每个角落，直到1955年5月间在绿油油的秧田里，捉到了几个幼虫，建立了固定的观测点，在这个观测点里五天一看，进行调查，他们发现到12月还有成虫，但是经过12月底到1956年1月初的几场大雪冰冻后，这种虫子便消失得无影无踪了。当时雷惠质主任还是相信日本著名昆虫学家村田藤七研究十四年得出的“可能是成虫或幼虫过冬”的结论是正确的，因此她还是要王治海去找虫。王治海在这个冰天雪地里，风里来，雨里去的，找了十多天也没找到。有一天，王治海来到前一次发现有虫的地方，望着水沟边的游草出神，他心里想：这些虫，下雪前有，下雪后就没有了，如果是成虫或幼虫过冬的话，那总有个地方安身嘛？他给自己提出了一个新问题：莫不是卵过冬？如果是卵又到哪里去找呢？成虫都只有虱子那么小，卵就更加不容易找到了。
    为了解答自己提出的这个新问题，他认为完全可以抛弃这种死死地到野外去找的办法，而采取做实验的办法。他想起下雪前几天，很多成虫还在游草里，而这种虫又是在炎热的稻田里生长的，要是把这些游草移入养虫室中栽植，增加温度使卵孵化，不就可以看出是不是卵过冬吗？想到这里，他像得了宝似的飞脚跑到办公室里，把刚才的想法对雷主任说了一遍，他的建议得到了领导上的支持，大伙都鼓励他，要他照着自己想法试试看。王治海在原来观测的地方扯了一些游草移植到温室里，他用了许多办法增加温室的温、湿度，自己就一直在旁边守护着，大约十来天后，发现了头一个幼虫，王治海高兴得把雷主任叫来看，雷主任说：“书本上都讲是成虫或幼虫过冬，现在只有一个虫，没有把握是卵过冬。”又过了三、四天，大批的幼虫出现了。到这时才肯定王治海的设想是对的，这一种虫害的过冬秘密就这样给王治海揭露出来了。
    经过1957年冬天的观察，王治海又对自己在1956年的发现进行继续研究，进一步肯定了那个结论，找到了这种害虫过冬的规律，它们在中稻收割后，就迁向沟圳内杂草生活，继续繁殖后代，严寒以后，才产卵于杂草内过冬。这个越冬虫害的发现，为从根本上进行大面积的防治工作找到了根据。在今年2月华中稻虫专业会议和去年11月全国水稻虫害预测预报会上，王治海这项研究发现受到了全国科学家的重视，会上并订出了全国褐飞虱预测预报方案。从今年起，湖南农业科学研究所已经确定宜章县为进一步研究防治褐飞虱的重点，由植保系主任雷惠质带了一个工作组去进行大面积的防治工作。
    最近，有人问王治海：“为什么专家们没想到的事情，你却想到了？”他说：“我主要是没有被日本科学家的结论所迷惑，我在田土里转得多，我这个办法是从田土里得到启发的。”
