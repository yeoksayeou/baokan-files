Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 1st: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong: At the Secretary-Generals' meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held on May 31st, the Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side once again raised a serious protest against the U.S. side's continued dispatch of spies to conduct hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese side, despite the protests from the Korean and Chinese side.

The Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that, according to the confession of Kim Hak-kyong, a member of the U.S. side's spy agency "H-D" special task force who was arrested by the Korean and Chinese side, it was confirmed that the U.S. side had established a spy agency dispatch team in Hwajinpo, not far from the demilitarized zone, and sent impoverished South Korean people and displaced poor people from northern Korea to northern Korea to carry out various sabotage activities. According to Kim Hak-kyong's confession and the testimony and material evidence provided in the joint investigation by the Joint Observer Team, the U.S. side's provocative acts were confirmed.

The Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that, in order to cover up its crimes, the U.S. side also violated the provisions and practices of the armistice agreement, and hastily suggested holding a Secretary-Generals' meeting to accuse the Korean and Chinese side before exchanging special reports and even before the special report of the U.S. member of the Joint Observer Team was formally submitted. The Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side said that the U.S. side's actions violated the relevant clauses of the armistice agreement and further exposed the U.S. side's crimes.

The Secretary-General of the Korean and Chinese side demanded that the U.S. side severely punish the personnel involved in this incident and guarantee that such incidents would not occur again.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 1st: The Japanese trade union delegation currently visiting Korea issued a statement yesterday stating that it is the American troops occupying South Korea that are hindering the unification of Korea. The statement believes that the peaceful reunification of Korea should be realized in accordance with the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5 this year.

The Japanese trade union delegation arrived in Pyongyang on May 24 and has visited various places in northern Korea in recent days.

　　美方继续派遣特务进行敌对活动
    朝中方面再提严重抗议
    新华社平壤1日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在5月31日举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长对美方不顾朝中方面抗议继续派遣特务对朝中方面进行敌对行为这件事再一次提出严重抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，根据被朝中方面逮捕的美方特务机关“H—D”特务队队员金学京的口供，证实美方在离非军事区不远的花津浦设立特务机关派遣队，把生活无着的南朝鲜人民和朝鲜北部的失所贫民派往朝鲜北部，进行各种破坏活动。根据金学京的口供和在联合观察小组的共同调查中提供的人证物证，证实了美方的挑衅行为。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方为了掩盖它的罪行，还违反停战协定的规定和惯例，在没有互交特别报告以前，甚至在联合观察小组美方成员的特别报告还没有正式提出的时候，就慌忙建议召开秘书长会议，对朝中方面进行指责。朝中方面秘书长说，美方的这种做法违反了停战协定的有关条款，并且进一步暴露了美方的罪行。
    朝中方面秘书长要求美方严惩同这次事件有关的人员，并且保证不再发生这类事件。
    据新华社平壤1日电　正在朝鲜访问的日本工会代表团昨天发表声明说，妨碍朝鲜统一的就是强占南朝鲜的美国军队。声明认为，朝鲜的和平统一应该根据今年2月5日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明加以实现。
    日本工会代表团是在5月24日到达平壤的，他们连日来曾经到朝鲜北部各地访问。
