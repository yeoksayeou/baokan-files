    Old Form, New Content
    The industrial departments of Shanghai have adopted the form of "temple fairs" to carry out the technical revolution with great enthusiasm. This form demonstrates that, driven by the great rectification movement, the broad masses of workers have raised their communist consciousness, broken down the mystified views on technology, liberated their minds, and developed a spirit of bold innovation.
    "Temple fairs" are a popular national form welcomed by the working people of our country. Using them to exchange technical experiences is a new creation in carrying out mass technical revolution movements. This kind of technical revolution "temple fair" can not only exchange technical experiences and impart technology at any time, but also exchange materials and share resources. The "temple fair" has physical objects, explanations, things, and people, the form is free and lively, run by the masses themselves, watched by themselves, short time, fast exhibition, low cost, and great results. In the era of the masses making great efforts in technical innovation, the temple fair form of technical revolution quickly flourished in Shanghai and was generally welcomed by the masses, which is reasonable.
    Of course, the reason why the technical revolution "temple fair" is attractive, effective, and gives great inspiration and education is not just its lively form, but more importantly its communist ideological content. On-the-spot teaching and learning in the "temple fair" profoundly embodies the communist spirit of mutual assistance, mutual support, and complete selflessness, which guarantees the great leap forward in socialist construction.

    上海市工业部门采取“庙会”的形式，把技术革命搞得热火朝天。这种形式显示了：在伟大的整风运动推动下，广大职工提高了共产主义觉悟，打破了对技术的神秘观点，解放了思想，发扬了大胆创造的精神。
    “庙会”是我国劳动人民喜闻乐见的一种民族形式。用来交流技术经验，这是开展群众性技术革命运动的一个新的创造。这种技术革命的“庙会”，不仅可以交流技术经验，随时传授技术，而且可以通过庙会交流物资，互通有无。“庙会”上有实物，有说明，有物，有人，形式自由活泼，由群众自己办，自己看，时间短、展出快，花费少，收效大。在群众大闹技术革新的时代，技术革命的庙会形式很快在上海蓬勃开展，并且受到群众普遍欢迎，这是有它的道理的。
    当然，技术革命“庙会”之所以能吸引人，有成效，给人启发教育大，并不只是它的形式活泼，更重要的是它的共产主义的思想内容。“庙会”里当场包教包学，深刻地体现了互相帮助、互相支援、大公无私的共产主义精神，这种精神保证社会主义建设大踏步前进。
