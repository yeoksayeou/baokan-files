    Multispike Wheat
    Recently, multispike wheat was discovered in Wenjia Village, Xucun Township, Cheng'an County, Hebei Province. This type of wheat is 145 cm tall, towering over other wheat varieties. Each plant has 7 to 11 spikes, with spike lengths ranging from 8 to 10 cm and 2 to 3 effective tillers. The stems are thick and the stalks are strong, providing strong wind resistance and preventing lodging. This wheat is a hybrid variety of "Buddha's Hand Wheat" and other wheat varieties, with a later maturity period, suitable for planting in high-yield fields. (Attached picture)

    多穗小麦
    河北成安县徐村乡温家庄村，最近发现了多穗小麦。这种小麦株高一百四十五公分，比其它小麦高出一头。每株有穗七至十一个，穗长八至十公分，有效分蘖二至三个。秆粗秸壮，抗风力强，不倒伏。这种麦是“佛手麦”与其它小麦的杂交品种，成熟期较晚，适于种到丰产地里。（附图片）
