Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 21st: According to TASS, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, delivered a report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the 17th, regarding the abolition of mandatory deliveries and in-kind payments for the work of Machine Tractor Stations, as well as the new system, procurement prices, and conditions for procuring agricultural products. In his report, he emphasized that the implementation of the new system for procuring agricultural products and unified procurement prices, as well as other issues submitted for discussion at this plenary session, is of extremely important significance for realizing the great plan of communist construction. They concern the interests of the Soviet state and all Soviet people.

Khrushchev pointed out that the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in economic development have created new possibilities for a more rapid upsurge in the national economy. At present, with the collective farms consolidated and profound qualitative changes taking place in the development of their public economy, the possibility has matured to abolish mandatory deliveries and transition to collective farms selling products to the state at unified prices set by the state for each region. He said that the further growth of Soviet agricultural output will enable the state to procure only a portion of marketable agricultural products through planned procurement in order to ensure the timely supply of food to residents, supply raw materials to industry, and establish necessary agricultural product reserves and regulate agricultural product prices. Collective farms will have a great opportunity to sell a large quantity of products on the market, and due to a sufficient quantity of goods in state-owned trade, prices on the collective farm market will undoubtedly be lower than retail prices in the near future.

Khrushchev listed some statistics to compare the growth rate of the total agricultural output of the Soviet Union and the United States in recent years. He said that in the four years from 1950 to 1953, the average annual growth rate of total Soviet agricultural output was 1.6%, while the United States was 1.7%, while in the most recent four years, the average annual growth rate of Soviet agricultural products has risen to 7.1%, while the United States has fallen to 1.1%.

Khrushchev said that the imperialists are alarmed by the achievements we have made in economic construction. They openly admit that the danger to the capitalist system now lies in the fact that the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp are vigorously working to further develop industry, agriculture, science and technology, and to improve the welfare of the people. He said that the achievements of socialist countries in economic development provide irrefutable material to the working people of capitalist countries to fight against imperialism and for the victory of peace, democracy, and the great cause of socialism.

Khrushchev pointed out that from 1959, it is appropriate to implement agricultural production specialization in collective farms, some union republics, and states. For example, grain must be mainly procured in Kazakhstan, Western Siberia, the Volga River basin, and the Trans-Urals region. In the future, large amounts of grain will also be purchased from collective farms and state farms in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, the Central Black Earth Region, and other regions. Considering that the collective farms in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Armenia, as well as many regions of the Uzbek, Georgian, and Azerbaijani republics, are most suitable for developing the production of industrial crops, these regions will not deliver grain to the state in the future.

When talking about the new procurement system, Khrushchev proposed a system of advance cash payments by the state when collective farms sell products. He said that the seasonality of cash income often disrupts the plans of collective farms and hinders them from regularly paying their members in advance. It should be stipulated that advance cash payments be made on schedule for the products that collective farms are to sell, and that collective farms not be charged interest on the use of advance funds.

Khrushchev said that the new procurement system recommended for discussion by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU is based on the profound changes that have taken place in Soviet agriculture in recent years. He said that the new procurement system will not only ensure that the state obtains the necessary amount of grain, but also create the prerequisites for further development of agricultural production, and it will more broadly unleash the initiative of collective farm members in developing the public economy.

Khrushchev said that the pricing policy for agricultural products is one of the most important issues in the entire procurement system. The pricing policy must not only ensure the expanded reproduction of collective farms, but also create a certain accumulation for developing industrial capacity, especially heavy industry. He pointed out that under the current system, agricultural product prices are very uneven, and collective farms can sell the same product at different prices. He said that another principle of remuneration should now be established, under which unified prices should be set for various agricultural products separately. Of course, considering natural, climatic, and economic conditions, price differences will exist in various regions of the country. The prices currently stipulated should be stable and flexible, and these prices should be appropriately adjusted according to the conditions of each year.

Khrushchev emphasized that with the implementation of unified prices, the irrational phenomena in the existing agricultural product remuneration will be eliminated, and the vast majority of collective farms across the country will benefit from this.

Khrushchev emphasized the important economic significance of the above-mentioned measures submitted for discussion at the plenary session. He said that the issue is not limited to economic aspects. The central issue of communist construction was and still is the issue of the worker-peasant alliance. The reorganization of Machine Tractor Stations, the change in the agricultural product procurement system, and the elimination of the phenomenon of uneven procurement prices will further strengthen the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, and will further strengthen the ties between urban and rural areas. Khrushchev also said that it is necessary to rectify the work of selling technical equipment to collective farms, technical repair stations, and state farms. He said that it is necessary to change the practice of overpricing agricultural machinery, fuel, and other products when selling them to collective farms. At this stage, collective farms are fully socialist enterprises, and they play an important role in completing the communist construction plan. Under the current conditions, it is very important to determine unified and correct national prices for machinery, equipment, fuel, and mineral fertilizers, because in the future, machinery and other industrial products will account for a very large proportion of the collective farm economy, a proportion that is incomparable to when tractors and agricultural machinery were not sold to collective farms.

In his report, Khrushchev also talked about managing agriculture with new methods. He emphasized that the adoption of scientifically based agricultural management systems in production must be regarded as a matter of national significance.

    加强工农联盟促进共产主义建设
    赫鲁晓夫报告苏联实行新的农产品采购制度的意义
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫17日在苏共中央全体会议上作了关于取消义务交售制和对机器拖拉机站工作的实物报酬以及关于新的农产品采购制度、采购价格和条件的报告。他在报告中强调指出，提交这次全会讨论的实行新的农产品采购制度和统一的采购价格以及其他问题，对实现共产主义建设的伟大计划具有极其重大的意义。它们涉及苏维埃国家和全体苏联人民的利益。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联在经济发展方面取得的巨大成就，为国民经济更迅速的高涨创造了新的可能。目前，在集体农庄已经巩固，它们的公有经济在发展过程中发生了深刻的质变的情况下，取消义务交售制和过渡到集体农庄按国家为各个地区分别规定的统一价格把产品卖给国家的可能性便成熟了。他说，苏联农产品产量的进一步增长将使得国家可以通过计划采购的办法只收购一部分商品农产品，以便能够及时保证供应居民食品，供应工业原料，建立必要的农产品后备和调节农产品价格。集体农庄将有很大的可能在市场上出售大量产品，而由于在国营贸易方面有了足够数量的商品，在不久的将来，集体农庄市场上的价格无疑将低于零售价格。
    赫鲁晓夫列举了一些统计数字来比较最近几年来苏联和美国农业总产量的增长速度。他说，在1950 年到1953年的四年内，苏联农业总产量每年平均增长速度为1.6％，而美国为1.7％，而最近四年来，苏联农产品的每年平均增长速度已经上升到7.1％，而美国则下降到1.1％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义者对我们在经济建设方面所获得的成就感到惊慌。他们公开承认，现在对资本主义体系的危险在于，苏联、社会主义阵营各国正在大力进行工作来进一步发展工业、农业、科学和技术，来提高人民的福利。他说，社会主义国家在经济发展方面的成就，向资本主义国家的劳动人民提供了无可辩驳的材料去为反对帝国主义，为争取和平、民主和社会主义伟大事业的胜利而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，从1959年起，在集体农庄、一些加盟共和国和州实行农业生产专业化是适宜的。例如，必须主要在哈萨克、西西伯利亚、伏尔加河流域和外乌拉尔地区采购谷物。今后也要从乌克兰、北高加索、中央黑土地带和其他区的集体农庄和国营农场收购大量的谷物。鉴于塔吉克、土库曼、亚美尼亚的集体农庄以及乌兹别克、格鲁吉亚和阿塞拜疆共和国的许多区最适宜于发展技术作物生产，今后这些地区将不向国家交售谷物。
    谈到新的采购制度时，赫鲁晓夫提出了集体农庄出售产品时国家预付现金的制度。他说，现金收入的季节性往往破坏集体农庄的计划，妨碍它们定期向集体农庄庄员预付报酬。应当规定对集体农庄所要出售的产品按期预付现金，而不向集体农庄征收使用预付金的利息。
    赫鲁晓夫说，建议苏共中央全会讨论的新的采购制度是根据近几年来苏联农业中所发生的深刻变化而提出的。他说，新的采购制度不仅要保证国家获得必要数量的粮食，而且还要给进一步发展农业生产创造前提，它将更加广泛地发挥集体农庄庄员在发展公有经济方面的主动性。
    赫鲁晓夫说，农产品的价格政策是整个采购制度中最重要的问题之一。价格政策不仅要保证集体农庄的扩大再生产，而且还要给发展工业能力、特别是重工业的能力创造一定的积累。他指出，在现行的制度下，农产品价格十分不统一，集体农庄拿同样的产品可以卖不同的价格。他说，现在应该建立另一种报酬原则，在这个原则下，各种农产品应分别规定统一的价格，当然，考虑到自然、气候和经济条件，国内各个地区将存在差价。目前所规定的价格应当是稳定的和灵活的，这些价格应当根据每年的条件作适当的调整。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，随着统一价格的实行，现存的农产品报酬中的不合理现象就将消除，全国各地的绝大多数集体农庄都将会从这里面得到好处。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出了提交全体会议讨论的上述那些措施的重要经济意义。他说，问题不单单局限于经济方面。共产主义建设的中心问题过去是、现在仍然是工农联盟的问题。机器拖拉机站的改组、农产品采购制度的改变、采购价格不统一的现象的消灭，这些都会进一步加强工人阶级同集体农民的联盟，都会进一步加强城乡联系。赫鲁晓夫还说，必须整顿向集体农庄、技术修理站和国营农场出售技术设备的工作。他说，必须改变把农业机器、燃料和其他制品卖给集体农庄时售价过高的做法。在现阶段，集体农庄是十足的社会主义企业，它们在完成共产主义建设计划中起着重要的作用。在目前的条件下，确定机器、设备、燃料、矿质肥料的国家统一的正确的价格是非常重要的。因为，今后机器和其他工业品在集体农庄经济中将要占非常大的比重，这个比重是从前没有向集体农庄出售拖拉机和农业机器时所无法比拟的。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中还谈到用新方法经营农业的问题。他强调指出，必须把在生产中采用有科学根据的经营农业的制度看成是有全国性重大意义的事情。
