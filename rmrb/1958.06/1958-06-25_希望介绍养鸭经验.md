Hope to Introduce Duck Raising Experience

To the Editor:

I am a feeder who was sent to the No. 2 duck shed of Jinlian Cooperative in Qiaojiaqiao, Jinqiao Township, eastern suburbs of Shanghai, last year for labor training. The agricultural knowledge in the People's Daily has been of great help to me. After participating in duck-raising production labor, I naturally pay more attention to reports on animal husbandry. However, I feel that there are not many articles on this aspect in your newspaper, especially few introductions to duck-raising experience. I have also gone to Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore and other places to buy professional books, but the results are also very few.

From the current point of view, developing pig raising is the main direction, but raising laying ducks is also a component part of animal husbandry, so whether its output increases or not will affect national production and the interests of the commune members. For this reason, I suggest that in addition to frequently publishing articles on animal husbandry specialties, introducing advanced figures, deeds, and experiences in animal husbandry production, you also establish a special column to raise questions and introduce experiences to each other. For example, I raise the question of "How to raise laying ducks well" and raise it in the newspaper so that readers can promote the spirit of cooperation to help solve it. This will not only solve my problems, but also help comrades who have the same problems as me.　Feng Xin

    希望介绍养鸭经验
    编辑同志：
    我是去年下放在上海东郊金桥乡瞿家桥金联社二号鸭棚劳动锻炼的饲养员。人民日报上的农业知识，对我有不少帮助。参加养鸭生产劳动以后，很自然地对畜牧方面报道更注意了。但是我觉得你报上有关这方面的文章不多，尤其关于养鸭方面的经验介绍更少。我曾经去上海新华书店等地方买业务书籍，结果也很少。
    从现在来看，发展养猪是主要方向，但饲养蛋鸭既是畜牧业中的一个组成部分，那它的产量增长与否也会影响到国家生产和社员利益。为了这一原因，我建议你们除了经常刊登些畜牧专业方面的文章，介绍些畜牧业生产方面的先进人物、事迹和经验；同时建立一个专栏，互相提出问题，介绍经验，例如我提出“如何养好出蛋鸭”问题，在报纸上提出来，让读者发扬协作精神帮助解决。这样既解决了我的问题，也帮助了和我有同样问题的同志。　冯新
