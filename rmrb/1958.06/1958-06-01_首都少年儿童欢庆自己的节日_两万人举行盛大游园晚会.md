Xinhua News Agency, May 31st. This evening, Beijing's Zhongshan Park became a world of joy for children. Twenty thousand children held a garden party here to celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day. Many foreign children in Beijing were also invited to participate in the party and celebrate the festival together.

Peng Zhen, Xu Xiangqian, Cai Chang, Li Dequan, Liu Ren and others also rushed to congratulate the children. When the members of the Moscow City Workers' Soviet delegation, who are currently visiting our country, entered the venue, the children welcomed the distinguished guests with warm applause.

After the little chairman announced the start of the party, Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, extended festive greetings to the children. He said that the recent Second Session of the Eighth National Congress formulated the general line for our country's socialist construction. Although you are still young, you have actively participated in the cause of socialist construction. He praised the children for their contributions in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, planting trees, and increasing the production of oil crops. He concluded by saying that we must build our motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and build our society into a communist society, which cannot rely only on the older generation, but also on you. He hopes that you will study hard, exercise your bodies, actively participate in public welfare activities, and aspire to be successors to the cause of communist construction.

Tonight, Zhongshan Park was like a fairyland, with countless colored electric lights sparkling in the lush trees. The park was filled with laughter and songs. The children and the uncles from the Navy, Army, and Air Force who came to congratulate them on their festival danced together in group dances and played various interesting games. Many art troupes also performed wonderful artistic programs. Representatives of the "Jiulan Group," "Seven Sisters," and "Steel Youth Commando Team" from the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site were surrounded by children at the party. The children performed their own programs for these heroic working uncles and aunts. (Attached picture)

At the capital's children's garden party, Zhang Shuhua, one of the famous Seven Sisters, a representative from the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, is telling the children about the great leap forward at the construction site.

Children's radio worker Sun Jingxiu told the children a story - "Festival Gifts", encouraging the children to be healthy, study well, and have good morals.
