Small Converter Steelmaking Method is Good
Jinan Shengjian Machinery Factory Successfully Builds Bessemer Furnace

(Reported by our newspaper) According to the *Dazhong Daily*, Jinan Shengjian Machinery Factory in Shandong Province has broken the mystique surrounding steelmaking and successfully built its own 1.2-ton Bessemer small converter for steelmaking. This small converter now produces 1.5 tons of steel per batch, and can produce more than 5 tons of steel per hour. Based on an eight-hour day, it can produce more than 40 tons. If the province builds 100 such small converters, it could produce more than one million tons of steel per year. This opens up a new avenue for solving the province's steel supply and developing the local steel industry.

This small converter was built starting at the end of last year to solve the difficulty of insufficient steel supply. The benefits of building this type of small converter are:

First, low investment, quick results. When building the furnace, Jinan Shengjian Machinery Factory designed and constructed simultaneously, and put it into production in one month. The total equipment (including blowers, cranes, drying kilns, annealing kilns, hot blast stoves and other auxiliary equipment) cost only more than 29,000 yuan. Among them, the furnace body, chimney, transmission system and molten steel bucket cost only more than 3,500 yuan.

Second, simple operation, easy to master technology. The steelmaking personnel of this factory went to Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant to study for more than ten days, and they were able to control all aspects of smelting technology such as air pressure, blowing temperature, and flame changes. Now, they can not only smelt ordinary low-carbon steel, but also smelt medium-carbon steel with high wear resistance and tensile strength.

Third, wide application, high efficiency. The maximum steel tapping temperature of this small converter reaches 1700 degrees Celsius, and the molten steel has good fluidity. It can not only cast ordinary steel ingots, but also cast various thin, odd-shaped steel parts and large steel parts of more than two tons. The factory uses the "low-silicon rapid blowing method," which takes only 15 minutes from charging molten iron to tapping steel, and can produce more than five tons of pure steel per hour.

Fourth, it can be produced intermittently or continuously as needed. General open-hearth furnaces or electric furnaces must be produced continuously due to slow heating and complex operation. Otherwise, sudden starts and stops will affect the life of the furnace and increase fuel consumption. This small converter can be turned on and off at any time. It can heat up to 1,200 degrees Celsius in two hours and start smelting, and because the furnace shell is made of quartz sand refractory mud, it can withstand cold and heat.

Fifth, convenient source of raw materials, low cost. Most open-hearth furnaces or electric furnaces need to add some scrap steel as material, while this small converter can make steel entirely from blast furnace pig iron.

The factory's self-built small converter steelmaking, in addition to meeting the factory's production needs, can also supply other units. Now, the factory's employees have broken the past sense of inferiority that steelmaking is mysterious and that small factories cannot do great things. They plan to further improve small converter steelmaking, and this year they will build a 400-kilowatt electric furnace to smelt high-grade steel. They also plan to build a complete set of steelmaking equipment themselves, so that they can produce 7,000 tons of seamless steel pipes and 47,000 tons of medium and small steel products annually in the future.

    小转炉炼钢办法好
    济南生建机械厂自建贝氏炉成功
    本报讯　据大众日报消息：山东省济南生建机械厂打破炼钢的神秘观点，自建一点二吨贝氏小转炉炼钢成功。这种小转炉现在每炉炼钢一点五吨，每小时可炼钢五吨多，一天按八小时算可炼四十多吨。如果全省建设一百个这种小转炉，一年就可炼百余万吨钢。这就为解决省内钢材供应和发展地方炼钢工业开辟了新途径。
    这座小转炉是为解决钢材供应不足的困难，从去年年底动手兴建的。建设这种小转炉的好处是：
    第一，投资少，收效快。济南生建机械厂在建炉时，一面设计一面施工，一个月就投入生产。全部设备（包括鼓风机、行车、烘干窑、退火窑、热风炉等附属设备）共二万九千多元。其中炉体部分、烟筒部分、传动系统和盛钢水桶等用料仅三千五百多元。
    第二，操作简便，技术容易掌握。这个工厂的炼钢人员到上海中铸钢厂学习了十多天，就能控制压风量、吹炼温度、火焰变化等各方面的冶炼技术，现在不仅能炼出一般低炭钢，还能冶炼耐磨性强、拉力大的中炭钢。
    第三，应用广，效能高。这种小转炉的最高出钢温度达一千七百度，钢水流动性好，既可浇铸一般钢锭，又可浇铸各种薄形、奇型钢件和二吨以上的大型钢件。该厂采用的是“低硅快速吹炼法”，从装入铁水到出钢只需十五分钟，每小时能炼出纯钢五吨多。
    第四，根据需要可以间歇生产，也能连续生产。一般平炉或电炉炼钢，因升温慢、操作复杂，必须连续生产，否则忽停忽开要影响炉子寿命，增加燃料耗用，而这种小转炉可以随时开随时停，二小时能升温到一千二百度，就可开始冶炼，而且因炉壳用石英砂耐火泥制造，经得起冷热。
    第五，原料来源方便，成本低。一般平炉或电炉炼钢，多数需要掺一部分废钢作材料，而这种小转炉可以全部用高炉生铁炼出钢来。
    这个工厂自建小转炉炼钢，除了能满足本厂生产需要外，还能供应其他单位。现在，这个工厂的职工已经打破了以往认为炼钢神秘化和小厂不能办大事的自卑感，计划把小转炉炼钢再提高一步，今年要自建一座四百瓩的电炉来冶炼高级钢。还准备自建全套炼钢设备，今后可年产七千吨无缝钢管和四万七千吨中小型钢材。（附图片）
