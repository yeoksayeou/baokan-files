    Learn Some New Songs
    Li Daoping, Wuhan University

    Our class went to the suburbs to help the agricultural cooperative harvest wheat. In the wheat fields, the members enthusiastically asked us to sing. Old men and old women also applauded and insisted that we sing. However, because we hadn't practiced well usually, none of us in the whole class knew any new songs. What to do? Singing old songs didn't feel right, but not singing was even worse. So the classmates pushed me to sing a solo, because I was the one in the class who liked to sing the most. Although I usually love to sing, the songs I know are mostly love songs and lyrical songs, and mostly foreign songs. The only modern song I know is "Socialism is Good." After I sang this one new song I knew, the cooperative members wanted me to sing again. At that time, I really couldn't think of what to sing. Singing those soft, sentimental love songs wasn't appropriate in an atmosphere full of labor enthusiasm. I felt very uneasy in front of the farmers.

    Because of this lesson, I hope that comrades will usually learn some new songs, so that when we have the opportunity to go to factories and rural areas, we can serve the workers and peasants.

    学会一些新歌曲
    武汉大学　李道平
    我班到郊区帮农业社收割麦子。在麦田里，社员们热烈地拉我们唱歌。老大爷老大娘也鼓掌叫起来，非要我们唱不可。可是，由于我们平时没有好好练习，全班会唱的新歌一个也没有。怎么办？唱旧歌嘛觉得不好，不唱嘛更不好。于是同学们推我独唱，因为我是班上最喜欢唱歌的一个。我平时虽然爱唱歌，但会唱的都是些爱情歌、抒情歌，而且多是外国歌曲。现代歌曲只会唱“社会主义好”。我唱完这首唯一会唱的新歌，社员们又要再唱。当时，我真想不出要唱些什么才好。唱那些软绵绵的爱情歌曲，在充满着劳动热情的气氛下，哪里适合呢？在农民面前，我感到了十分不安。
    由于这个教训，我希望同志们平时必须学会些新歌曲，以便有机会到工厂到农村时，可以为工农服务。
