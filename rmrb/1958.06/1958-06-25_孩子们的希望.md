    Children's Hopes
    We really like the poem "Children's Section" published on the fourth page of the June 1st issue. A group of us children gathered together and read it over and over again, feeling more and more fond of it each time.
    We all know that Uncle Chen Yi, the author of "Children's Section," is the Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He is so busy with his work, yet he still takes the time to write such a good poem for us children. How happy and grateful we are! We sincerely hope that writers and poet uncles will also care more about us and write more short and good children's works for us to read and recite, to satisfy our urgent needs.

    孩子们的希望
    我们很喜欢6月1日第四版上刊登的诗——“儿童篇”。我们一群小朋友聚拢在一起，把它念了一遍又一遍，越念越觉得亲切。
    我们都知道，“儿童篇”的作者陈毅伯伯是副总理兼外交部长，他工作那么繁重，还抽空给我们小朋友写了这么好的诗，我们多么高兴和感激呀！我们很希望作家和诗人叔叔们也来多多关怀我们，多写些又短又好的儿童作品给我们阅读和朗诵，满足我们的迫切要求。
