Actively Strive for Increased Early Rice Production

This year, the total area sown with early rice across the country is approximately 160 million mu, an increase of about 40 million mu compared to last year, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total rice sown area in the country. In areas south of the Nanling Mountains, where temperatures are higher, some early rice has already begun to be harvested; in most areas of the Yangtze River basin, early rice will mature around the Great Heat (July 23rd). Therefore, it is now urgently necessary to strengthen field management and strive for a good harvest of early rice. This is also an important link in achieving a good harvest of rice throughout the year.

In the past, in many areas, because early rice was sown early and matured early, it could avoid disasters such as floods, droughts, and typhoons, ensuring stable yields. This often led to relaxed cultivation management, resulting in the national average yield of early rice remaining at the level of just over 300 jin per mu for several years, which is very regrettable. The numerous examples of high-yield early rice production in various regions over the years have proven that the potential for increasing early rice production is significant. Last year, the high-yield early rice of the Hekou No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, reached 1,290 jin per mu, which is about four times higher than the national average yield. Their experience proves that as long as early plowing, early sowing, early transplanting, close planting, and sufficient base fertilizer are implemented in the early stages, and field management is strengthened in the later stages, doing a good job of shallow irrigation, topdressing, inter-tillage, weeding, pest control, and careful harvesting, early rice can completely achieve high yields.

This year, leading departments and farmers in the Yangtze River basin and south of the Nanling Mountains have attached great importance to early rice production, grasped it tightly, started early, absorbed more advanced experience, boldly innovated technology, and highly exerted revolutionary drive, working hard day and night to expand the area sown with early rice, advance the transplanting date, and transplant more densely and well. Irrigation water and fertilizer application have also exceeded any year in history, so the growth of early rice is generally stronger than last year. However, in some areas, there has been more rain and lower temperatures after transplanting, and the seedlings have been slow to turn green and grow. Some areas have also rushed to transplant after drought relief or drainage, resulting in a longer transplanting period and very uneven early rice growth. In Hunan Province, third-class seedlings account for about 10%, and in Jiangxi Province, it is estimated that third-class seedlings also account for 15% to 20%; other provinces have similar situations. Therefore, all regions cannot be satisfied with the achievements made in the previous stage of early rice production, and must continue to make persistent efforts, seize every link, strengthen field management, and lead the masses to vigorously improve first and second-class seedlings and eliminate third-class seedlings. This is the key to determining whether this year's early rice harvest will be abundant or poor.

Based on the current seedling growth, the first step in strengthening early rice field management is topdressing and inter-tillage. For first and second-class seedlings, fertilizer should be replenished where there is a shortage, and fertilizer should be applied to key areas. Third-class seedlings should strive for two topdressings. Historically, Zhejiang has experience in applying panicle fertilizer, and Guangxi has experience in plucking rice shoots; in recent years, these experiences have been applied to early rice with significant yield increases. Therefore, in areas where early rice is in the stage of stem elongation and beginning to ear, the timing should be grasped, and a quick-acting fertilizer equivalent to 8 to 10 jin of ammonium sulfate should be applied per mu in a timely manner. At the same time as topdressing, inter-tillage and weeding should also be done well. After the seedlings close the rows, attention should be paid to removing barnyard grass to avoid diverting nutrients from the rice seedlings.

The second step is to strengthen irrigation management, use water rationally, and prevent lodging. This year, early rice has been transplanted more densely and fertilized more heavily. The experience of many high-yield areas has proven that under these circumstances, shallow irrigation and frequent irrigation must be implemented, the fields must be dried in a timely manner, and fertilizer must be applied rationally. This can not only guarantee a good harvest, but also more effectively prevent early lodging. Currently, rainfall is high in some early rice areas, and some rice fields have poor drainage and irrigation equipment and deep waterlogging. Waterlogging should be quickly drained and the drainage and irrigation system should be actively improved. Areas with low drought resistance should pay attention to water storage and conservation and water conservation early to prevent later drought.

The third step is to pay attention to preventing pests and diseases. Pests and diseases are formidable enemies of early rice production, especially rice stem borers, which are widespread and serious. According to news from Zhejiang Province, the general occurrence period of the two-generation rice borer and three-generation rice borer is five to ten days earlier than in previous years. Continuous cropping of early rice generally involves early transplanting, and most of the rice stem borer moths fly to the paddy fields to lay eggs. In addition, the low temperature and rainy weather in the previous period slowed down the growth of rice seedlings, which is conducive to the intrusion of ant borers. It is estimated that rice stem borer damage will be more serious than in previous years. In some areas of Hunan, Anhui and other provinces, rice stink bugs have also often harmed early rice in recent years, causing reduced yields. Rice blast has occurred on a large scale in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong Province, and has also occurred in some coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. Seriously affected rice fields often result in reduced yields. Currently, it is the key period for preventing and controlling early rice stem borers and panicle blast. It is best to spray 666 pesticide widely; when 666 pesticide is lacking, methods such as lighting lamps to attract moths and inserting tobacco stems can also be used. To prevent and control early rice panicle blast, spraying with a mixture of Xilaisheng or Saisansan and lime powder will also have good results.

The fourth step is to do a good job of harvesting. In most early rice areas, while harvesting early rice, it is also necessary to transplant late rice or plant late autumn crops, and some also have to take into account dry land crops. The time is short, the work is busy, and the labor is intense. In the past, due to improper arrangements in some areas, they often lost sight of one thing while attending to another. Either the early rice was not harvested in time, affecting the timely planting of late rice and late autumn crops, or the harvest was not meticulous, resulting in scattering. This year, we must learn from this lesson, fully prepare ideologically and organize and mobilize, help agricultural cooperatives make arrangements for labor and livestock, repair and replenish farm implements, actively improve farm implements, and improve efficiency. It is also necessary to organize necessary support and cooperation. It is necessary to harvest quickly and well, and truly ensure that all grains are stored in granaries. It is also necessary to not delay the planting of late rice and late autumn crops.

    积极争取早稻多增产
    今年全国早稻播种面积约一亿六千万亩，约比去年增加四千万亩，占全国水稻播种总面积四分之一以上。在气温较高的五岭以南地区，部分早稻已经开始收割；在长江流域大部地区，大暑（7月23日）前后早稻即可成熟。因此，目前急需加强田间管理，争取早稻丰收。这也是实现水稻全年丰收的重要环节。
    过去，在很多地区，由于早稻播种早，成熟早，可以避过水、旱、台风等灾害，稳产保收，往往就放松了栽培管理，以致几年来全国早稻平均亩产量始终停留在三百多斤的水平，这是很可惜的。历年来各地很多早稻高额丰产的事例证明，早稻的增产潜力是很大的。去年湖北省浠水县合兴第一农业社的丰产早稻，每亩达到一千二百九十斤，高出全国平均产量四倍左右。它们的经验证明，只要前期实行了早耕、早播、早插、密植、施足基肥，后期加强田间管理，做好浅灌、追肥、中耕、除草、除虫、细收细打等工作，早稻就完全可以高产丰收。
    今年长江流域和五岭以南地区的各级领导部门和广大农民，都非常重视早稻生产，抓得紧、动手早、吸取先进经验多，大胆革新技术，高度发挥革命干劲，日夜苦战，使早稻播种面积扩大，插秧提早，并且插得又密又好，灌溉水和施肥也都超过历史上任何一年，因而早稻生长一般都比去年强。但是，也有一些地区，插秧以后阴雨多，气温低，禾苗返青、生长缓慢。还有部分地区是在抗旱中或者排渍后抢插的，插秧期拖得较长，早稻生长很不平衡。湖南省三类苗约占10％左右，江西省估计三类苗也在15％到20％之间；其他各省也有类似情况。因此各地就不能满足于前一阶段早稻生产所取得的成绩，必须再接再厉，抓紧每一个环节，加强田间管理，领导群众大力提高一二类苗，消灭三类苗。这是决定今年早稻收成丰歉的关键所在。
    根据目前禾苗生长情况，加强早稻田间管理的第一个环节是追肥和中耕。对一、二类苗要做到缺肥补肥，重点施肥。对三类苗要争取追肥两次。历史上，浙江有施穗肥的经验，广西有拨禾胎的经验，近年来这些经验应用在早稻方面，增产效果显著。因此，凡早稻正在圆秆、开始孕穗的地区，应该掌握火候，及时每亩追施相等于八斤至十斤硫铵的速效肥料。在追肥的同时，还要做好中耕除草。当禾苗封行以后，要注意清除稗草，以免分散稻苗养分。
    第二个环节，是加强灌溉管理，合理用水，防止倒伏。今年早稻插得比较密、施肥比较多。很多丰产地区的经验证明，在这种情形下，必须实行浅灌勤灌，适期晒田，合理施肥。这不仅能够保证丰收，而且更能有效地防止早期倒伏。目前部分早稻地区降雨量较多，有些稻田排灌设备较差，渍水较深，应该迅速排除渍水，并积极改善排灌系统。抗旱能力较低的地区，为了预防后期干旱，则要及早注意蓄水保水和节约用水。
    第三个环节，是注意防止病虫灾害。病虫害是早稻生产上的劲敌，尤以螟虫的为害普遍而严重。据浙江省消息，今年二化螟、三化螟，一般发生期比往年提早五天到十天。连作早稻普遍早插，早稻的螟蛾绝大部分飞到本田产卵。加上前一段时间低温多雨，稻苗生长慢，有利蚁螟侵入，估计螟害将比往年加重。在湖南、安徽等省部分地区，稻椿象几年来也常为害早稻，造成减产。稻瘟病在广东潮汕地区发生范围较广，福建、浙江沿海局部地区也曾发生，受害严重的稻田，往往造成减产。目前正是防治早稻螟虫和穗颈稻瘟病的关键时期，最好是广泛地喷射六六六药剂；在六六六药剂缺乏时，也可以采用点灯诱蛾和插烟茎等办法。防治早稻穗颈稻瘟病，用西力生或赛力散与石灰粉混合喷射，效果也会很好。
    第四个环节，是做好收获工作。大部分早稻地区在收获早稻的同时，还要插好晚稻或种好晚秋，有的还要兼顾旱田作物，时间短，工作忙，劳动紧张。过去有些地区由于安排不当，常常顾此失彼，不是早稻收获不及时，影响晚稻和晚秋适时栽种，就是收获不精细，造成抛撒。今年必须接受这一教训，充分作好思想准备和组织动员，帮助农业社做好劳力和畜力的安排，整修添补农具，积极改良农具，提高效率。并且要组织必要的支援和协作。既要收得快收得好，切实做到颗粒归仓。又要不误晚稻、晚秋栽种。
