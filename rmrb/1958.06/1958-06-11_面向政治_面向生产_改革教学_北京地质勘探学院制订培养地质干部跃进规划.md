Orienting Towards Politics, Orienting Towards Production, Reforming Teaching
Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration Formulates Great Leap Forward Plan for Training Geological Cadres

(Our report) The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, when conveying and implementing the general line of socialist construction, put forward an outline for reforming teaching and scientific research centered on orienting towards politics and orienting towards production. It mobilized teachers and students to "break down superstitions, dare to think, dare to do, everyone contributes ideas, everyone is as wise as Zhuge Liang," and formulated a Great Leap Forward plan.

The overall goal of this plan is: "Work hard and diligently, and within five years, transform the Institute of Geological Exploration into an advanced institute in both teaching and scientific research." The specific indicators and measures emphasize in-depth ideological revolution, setting off a high tide of studying Marxism-Leninism, and everyone planting red flags. To train a large number of geological cadres for the country quickly, well, and economically, while ensuring quality, the five-year system will be changed to a four-and-a-half-year system, so that students graduate half a year earlier. This will meet the needs of geological departments to supplement cadres at the beginning of each year. Within five years, a set of teaching staff capable of enrolling two thousand students for the geological institute will be gradually delivered. At the same time, without increasing manpower and material resources, it will train 20,000 geological talents of all levels for the country through running training courses, correspondence courses, secondary technical schools, cadre refresher courses, and old cadre courses. In teaching and scientific research, it is emphasized that quality should be improved and world advanced levels should be caught up with through combining with production. In the past, students trained by this school often could not quickly participate in production work due to a lack of practical knowledge after arriving at geological departments. Now, the plan has decided that starting from this semester, the time students spend in field study and production will be increased. Students in the five-year system will spend two years in field production study. Now the school has accepted the tasks of general survey and prospecting in twelve provinces and cities, covering an area of more than 400,000 square kilometers, which is equivalent to walking all over the national area of two countries such as England. The geological survey task in Beijing, which was originally planned to be completed in five years, has now been changed to be completed this year. More than 4,000 students in the second, third, and fourth grades have organized production internship teams and are preparing to depart at the end of the month. In scientific research, it has also been determined that within a certain period of time, 50 research topics should catch up with or surpass the international level. This year, the production and research tasks of China's 1:200,000 geological map must be completed. It is also necessary to study the genesis, distribution patterns, and prospecting methods of large, medium, and small ore deposits, the utilization of peat, and groundwater in arid areas. These issues are urgently required to be resolved in the implementation of the central government's policy of simultaneously developing central industries and local industries, and simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises by the relevant industrial departments.

    面向政治　面向生产　改革教学
    北京地质勘探学院制订培养地质干部跃进规划
    本报讯　中共北京地质勘探学院委员会在传达贯彻社会主义建设总路线时，提出以面向政治、面向生产为中心的改革教学和科学研究的纲要，发动师生“破除迷信、敢想、敢做、人人献计策、个个赛诸葛”，制订了跃进规划。
    这个规划的总目标是：“大干苦干，五年内把地质勘探学院变为教学和科学研究方面都先进的学院”。在具体指标和措施中，强调深入思想革命，掀起学习马列主义的高潮，人人插红旗。多快好省地为国家培养大量的地质干部，在保证质量的前提下，把五年制改为四年半制，使学生提早半年毕业，适应地质部门每年年初需要补充干部的要求，五年内逐步输送出一套能招两千学生的地质学院的教学骨干。同时，在不增加人力物力的基础上，通过开办训练班、函授班、中等技术学校、干部进修班和老干部班等方式为国家培训两万名各级地质人才。在教学和科学研究上强调通过结合生产的途径提高质量，赶上世界先进水平。过去这个学校培养出来的学生到地质部门后往往由于缺乏实践的知识而不能很快地参加生产工作。现在规划中决定从这一学期开始，增加学生在野外学习和生产的时间，五年制的学生将有两年时间在野外生产学习。现在这个学校已经接受了十二个省市、四十多万平方公里面积的普查和找矿任务，等于要走遍两个英国的全国面积。原来计划在五年内完成的北京地质查勘任务，现在也改为在今年内完成。现在二、三、四年级的四千多学生已经组织了生产实习队，准备在月底出发。在科学研究上也确定在一定时间内要有五十项研究题目赶上国际水平或超过国际水平。今年内就要完成我国二十万分之一地质图的生产和研究任务。还要研究大、中、小矿床的成因、分布规律和找矿方法，泥煤的利用以及干旱地区地下水等问题。这些问题都是有关工业部门贯彻中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针中迫切要求解决的问题。
