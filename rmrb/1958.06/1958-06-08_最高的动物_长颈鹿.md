　　The Tallest Animal—The Giraffe
　　Jiang Shaozhong
    In the woods on the north bank of the Black Water Pond in the Beijing Zoo, there is a tall and spacious giraffe enclosure. This special building has doors that are over six meters high. Inside live three of the world's most famous tallest animals—giraffes. Two of the younger giraffes were transported to Beijing only in the middle of last month.
    The giraffe is a unique animal of Africa and is one of the most beautiful of the deer family. Giraffes have many characteristics. In addition to their long necks, their limbs, faces, and tongues are very long. The tallest of them can grow to about six meters. Both males and females have short horns on their heads, and some individuals even have three. They generally do not live in dense forests, preferring to live in groups on the edges of forests or in sparsely wooded grasslands. When they forage in the sparse woods, they use their long necks, which extend beyond the treetops, to look around and monitor for enemy attacks. If they have any defensive weapons at all, it would be the mottled patterns on their bodies, which look like shadows of leaves under the strong sunlight, making it difficult for enemies to spot them. In addition, they have strong limbs and are very good at running. When necessary, they can quickly run into the thickest and thorniest bushes to avoid enemy attacks.
    However, their tall stature also brings them many inconveniences: when they run fast, they sway from side to side, and it is quite difficult for them to eat food on the ground or drink water. However, they are very drought-resistant and can go without water for several months.
    The three young giraffes exhibited in the Beijing Zoo are already quite impressive, even though they are only about three meters tall now. When they eat, the keepers must first place the feed in a feed box that is seven or eight feet above the ground to make it easier for them to eat. Although they are native to hot Africa, they are also very cold-resistant and can exercise outdoors even in colder seasons. Therefore, they live very comfortably in the giraffe enclosure in Beijing. Even the two who have just arrived do not seem to be unaccustomed at all. (Attached picture)

### 最高的动物——长颈鹿

　　最高的动物——长颈鹿
　　蒋绍仲
    在北京动物园黑水洋北岸的树林里，有一座高大宽敞的长颈鹿馆。这座特殊的建筑，房门高达六米以上。里面住着三只世界著名的最高动物——长颈鹿。其中两只比较年幼的长颈鹿，是在上月中旬才运到北京的。
    长颈鹿是非洲的特产动物，是鹿科动物中最美丽的一种。长颈鹿的特点很多，除了它有很长的脖子外，四肢、面部和舌头都很长。它们的身体最高的可以长到六米左右。雌雄的头上都生有短短的两只角，个别的还生三只。它们一般不住在密林里，喜欢成群的生活在森林边缘或疏林草原区。它们在疏林寻食的时候，就用那超出树颠的长脖子来东张西望，监视敌人的袭击。如果说它们还有一点什么防御性的武器的话，那便是身上斑驳陆离的花纹，在强烈的阳光照耀下很像树叶的影子，因此不大容易被敌人发现。此外，它们有强健的四肢，十分善于奔跑，必要时会很快地跑到刺最多最密的灌木丛林中，躲避敌害的袭击。
    但是，它们这种高大的身躯也给自己带来了许多不便：当它快跑的时候，不住的左右摇摆，如果它要吃地上的食物或喝水的时候，也是相当费劲的。不过它们很能耐渴，可以几个月不喝水。
    北京动物园里展览的这三只幼年的长颈鹿，现在虽然才有一丈来高，但是已经是很可观了。当它们吃东西的时候，饲养人员须先把饲料放在高出地面七、八尺的饲料箱内，使它们取食方便。它们虽然产在炎热的非洲，但是也很能耐寒，即便是在较冷的季节，也可以到室外来运动。所以它们住在北京的长颈鹿馆里，非常怡然自得。连那新来不久的两只，也毫无不习惯的样子。（附图片）
