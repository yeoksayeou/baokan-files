(Reported by our newspaper) After a year of rectification, a new situation has emerged in the leadership style and working methods of cadres at all levels of the People's Liberation Army.

Many cadres have left their offices, gone deep into the grassroots, guided work, and lived, ate, worked, and operated alongside soldiers as ordinary soldiers. Since the beginning of this year, from the General Headquarters to the regimental organs, plans have been formulated for each person to spend at least four, five, or six months of the year in the troops. The proportion of leading cadres going down is the largest, and the time spent is the longest, reversing the previous situation where fewer leading cadres went down for shorter periods. All leading cadres going to the troops try to seize first-hand materials as much as possible, and some have even achieved the "five selfs" (seeing for themselves, hearing for themselves, thinking for themselves, writing for themselves, and doing ideological work for themselves); relying solely on the reports of assistants and lower-level organs no longer exists. Most of the cadres sent by the leading organs at all levels to the companies have changed the past situation of "glancing around, asking a few questions, and saying a few words," and now live, eat, work, and operate with the soldiers. The soldiers say: "In the past, cadres pointed fingers; now, they do it themselves, using both their hands and feet." In many units, from generals to lieutenants, they roll, crawl, grapple, drill, maneuver, and perform alongside the soldiers during training and construction. Now, touching stories are emerging in the army: a division commander goes down to serve as a company commander; a division political commissar goes down to a company as a soldier to follow training; a logistics department director goes down to a company as a cook to study how to save coal and grain and improve meals; a hospital director serves as a nurse; a military region commander repairs the grounds and cleans up alongside soldiers; and a division political department director stands guard for soldiers, allowing them to go to the movies. He Yunfeng, the division commander of a certain division, and Zhang Huamin, the deputy division commander, went to the company as soldiers to set up experimental fields. They wore soldiers' uniforms, wore the rank of private first class, and lived in the squad. At first, the soldiers were very surprised, and some were even a little scared, saying: "We have to take good care of them." However, they treated the soldiers equally and rolled around in the sun and dust with them during training. Their practical actions moved all the officers and soldiers, and fear quickly turned into love, and a close relationship was established. Not only did it inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the officers and soldiers, but it also allowed them to experience the thoughts and feelings of many soldiers and many problems that they had not understood in the past. Based on the experience of this company, they proposed solutions to the entire division and made many useful suggestions to the military region regarding training work. The action of leading cadres going deep into the squads and platoons deeply moved the soldiers, thereby greatly strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers. The soldiers praised: "Rectification's power is boundless, officers' style greatly changes, soldiers don't sleep, officers don't sleep, soldiers don't eat, officers don't swallow." Some soldiers who used to have opinions about the cadres and complained have now changed their understanding. They say, "It's not easy to be a cadre," "Cadres suffer first and enjoy later, caring about others and forgetting themselves."

Leading cadres go deep into the troops, providing on-the-spot guidance, solving problems, and summarizing experiences, which has powerfully promoted the work. In the past, the Second Military Medical University had a large organization and wasted a lot of funds, but during the "double-anti" campaign, personnel and funds could not be reduced. Hong Xuezhi, the General Logistics Minister, personally went to inspect and mobilized the masses to organize debates there. As a result, he set the target of reducing personnel by 42.8% and saving funds by 50%. Subsequently, he convened the leading cadres of various medical universities to the school to hold an on-site meeting, which immediately promoted the "double-anti" work of the various schools. After leading cadres went to the troops, they not only discovered and corrected some decisions and instructions that they had made in the office that were not in line with the actual situation, but also discovered many advanced experiences and creations that had been buried for a long time due to the lack of in-depth work, and summarized and promoted them, making them a force to promote the work. Before 1954, when the naval organs sent cadres to inspect the work, they found that the ship units had great potential for self-repair, and had orally and in writing put forward opinions on expanding the items and scope of self-repair. However, because they did not conduct a good investigation and research at that time, and could not put forward practical measures, they failed to implement it, and slowly no one mentioned it again. It was not until the 14th Squadron of the 5th Detachment of Landing Craft of the East China Sea Fleet proposed the initiative of not sending ships to the factory for minor repairs during the "double-anti" high tide that it received the attention of the leadership, and the deputy director of the repair department was dispatched to lead a working group to understand and conduct experiments, which proved that the suggestion was completely feasible.

With the transformation of the leadership style, there has also been a leap forward in working methods. During the rectification movement, cadres at all levels have successively learned a series of new mass line working methods such as dissecting "sparrows," planting experimental fields, holding on-site meetings, grasping both ends to bring along the middle, grasping typical examples to set up pacesetters, and conducting comparisons and competitions. These are now being implemented universally in the troops and have been initially mastered by the vast number of cadres, bearing fruit in many places. According to statistics from the Beijing Military Region and the Nanjing Military Region, as of now, there are 937 "experimental units"; in a certain army alone, 648 people at the army, division, and regimental levels have gone to the companies to conduct various experimental fields. The slogan of the people is: "Where there is difficulty, go there to experiment." On-site meetings have spread to every corner, and people describe it as: "Where there is advancement, there is an on-site meeting." In the second half of March alone, a certain division held 100 on-site meetings, at which experiences in saving oil, cloth, coal, teaching methods, technical operations, tool reforms, pig raising and vegetable growing, anti-championshipism, cadres living in squads and having four sameness with soldiers, and other issues were promoted. The widespread convening of on-site meetings has enabled many troops to have a situation of "where there is a problem in one place, attention is paid everywhere"; "where there is advancement in one place, it blossoms everywhere." Many troops have now established the first batch and even the second and third batches of pacesetters, achieving the goal of having their own pacesetters from the squad to the division and even various business systems. People call this situation "each has its own flag, each has its own goal." The "five-good" movement in the companies has been launched throughout the army, and cadres and units are conducting comparisons based on different characteristics and different content. The political departments of the Fuzhou and Nanjing Military Regions have decided to conduct 10 to 12 political work comparisons this year, and some even require the army and division to conduct a comparison for each training stage, and the battalion and company to conduct a comparison for each training topic. The implementation of these methods has greatly promoted the movement to compare with, learn from, and catch up with the advanced, creating a magnificent situation in the troops of "the waves behind push the waves in front, and each wave is higher than the last."

Another sign of the transformation of the leadership style is that the right-leaning conservative thinking of not trusting the masses has been reversed, and the thinking of many cadres has been liberated. Coupled with the improvement of the masses' awareness and internal relations, it has boosted the masses' unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm. Many things that were previously considered impossible are now being done. "What others can do, we must also do; what others cannot do, we will try," has become the common saying of the vast number of masses.

Now, it can be universally seen that for the same thing, before and after the rectification, many cadres have two different views and practices. In terms of training, in the past, some people always thought that "there is a lot of content, heavy tasks, and little time," which was difficult to do. This year, most troops have proposed that training tasks can be completed ahead of schedule, the training content can be increased, and the quality can be improved. In terms of tactical training content of the army troops, the tactical topics that some troops plan to carry out this year are more than 10% more than the total of 1956 and 1957. The number of troops planning to conduct joint training is also nearly doubled compared to last year. In the past, when some cadres accepted tasks, they always reached out to ask the higher authorities for people and money, thinking that the more people the better, the more money the better, so that things could be done well, thus causing a waste of a lot of manpower and material resources, but the things were not necessarily done well, and some were even done badly. The rectification and "double-anti" movement broke this view. People realized the profound significance of putting politics in command, and fully exploited the enthusiasm of people in various tasks, and things were done well with less money and fewer people.

In the past, some comrades attempted to rely solely on systems to do everything well, and did not understand the principle that systems should be formulated, revised, and even canceled according to work needs. This situation not only existed in high-level leading organs, but was also quite common in some lower-level organs. For example, in the past, a certain regiment implemented a collective outpatient system. The queues were very long during outpatient visits, and soldiers missed 20,000 class-times a year due to seeing a doctor. In the early stage of rectification, the masses posted big-character posters saying: "Doctors don't go out to see patients, but sit at home waiting for patients. Long queues form in front of the door. It's not treating diseases, it's treating people." However, some people thought that this system could not be changed. After the leadership launched a discussion: "Does the system serve people, or do people serve the system? Which method is better, collective outpatient visits or doctors going to the companies?" As a result, people's understanding changed, and the doctors went down to the companies, which reduced the absenteeism rate by more than 90%, reduced the incidence rate by 34%, and increased the cure rate by 35%.

    解放军经过整风进一步发扬了光荣传统
    领导干部深入连队  官兵关系更加亲密
    战士们说：整风效力大无边，军官作风大转变，兵不入睡官不眠，兵不吃饭官不咽
    本报讯  经过一年来整风运动的洗礼，人民解放军各级干部的领导作风和工作方法出现了一个崭新的局面。
    许多干部走出办公室，深入基层，指导工作，并以普通军人的身份与士兵同住、同吃、同劳动、同操作。今年以来，从各总部以至团的机关都分别订出了每人每年至少下部队四、五、六个月的规划。下部队人员中以领导干部比例最大，时间最长，一反过去领导干部下去少、时间短的状况。所有下部队的领导干部都尽可能利用时间去抓取第一手的材料，有的还作到了五亲
  （亲自去看，亲自去听，亲自去想，亲自去写，亲自去做思想工作）；仅仅依靠助手和下级机关汇报的情况已经不存在了。各级领导机关下连队的干部，大多数都已改变过去那种“溜溜看看，问问说说”的情况，而与士兵一起住宿，一起吃饭，一起劳动，一起操作了。战士们说：“过去干部是指手划脚，现在是亲自干，动手动脚了”。不少单位在训练和施工中，从将军到尉官，都同战士一起摸、爬、滚、打、抓、钻、操、演。现在部队出现了这样动人的故事：师长下去当连长；师政委下连当兵，跟班训练；后勤处长下连当炊事员，研究怎样节约煤粮改善伙食；医院院长当护理员；军区司令员同战士一齐修场地、打扫卫生；师政治部主任代士兵站岗值勤，换士兵去看电影。某师师长何云峰、副师长张华民以当兵的方式到连队搞试验田，他们着士兵服，带上等兵军衔住在班里。开始时士兵感到很惊奇，有的还有些害怕，说：“这要好好照顾才行”。但是他们完全以平等的态度和战士一起，在太阳下尘土里滚爬操练。实际行动感动了全体官兵，很快就由怕变成爱，并且建立了亲密的感情。不但鼓舞了官兵的革命干劲，而且从中体会许多士兵的思想感情和许多过去不了解的问题，并根据这个连的经验向全师提出了解决的办法，向军区提出了有关训练工作的许多有益建议。领导干部深入班、排的行动，使士兵深受感动，从而大大密切了官兵关系。战士们赞扬说：“整风效力大无边，军官作风大转变，兵不入睡官不眠，兵不吃饭官不咽”。有些过去对干部有意见，发牢骚的士兵现在也转变了认识，他们说“当干部真不容易”“干部吃苦在前，享受在后，关心别人，忘了自己”。
    领导干部深入部队，就地指导，解决问题，总结经验，有力地推动了工作。第二军医大学过去机构庞大，经费浪费较多，但在双反运动中人员、经费都减不下来。总后勤部长洪学智上将亲自前往检查，并在那里发动群众组织辩论，结果订出了削减人员42.8％，节约经费50％的指标；随后又召集各医大领导干部到这个学校去召开了现场会议，立即推动了各个学校的双反工作。领导干部下到部队后，不仅发现和纠正了过去坐在办公室中作出的一些不符合实际情况的决定指示，而且发现了过去由于工作不深入而长期被埋没的许多先进经验和创造，并加以总结推广，使之成为推动工作的力量。海军在1954年以前，机关干部下去检查工作时，发现舰艇部队自修潜力很大，曾经口头和书面提出过扩大自修项目和范围的意见。但由于当时没有很好地调查研究，提不出切实的措施来，因而未能执行，慢慢地也就没有人再提了。直到双反高潮中，东海舰队登陆艇五支队十四大队提出舰艇小修不进厂的倡议之后才得到领导的重视，并派出修造部副部长率领工作组前往了解，进行试验，结果证明这个建议完全可行。
    随着领导作风的转变，工作方法也来了一个跃进。在整风运动中，各级干部都纷纷学习了解剖“麻雀”、种试验田、开现场会议、抓两头带中间、抓典型立标兵、评比竞赛等一系列的新的群众路线的工作方法。这些现在都已在部队中普遍施行，并且已被广大干部初步掌握，在许多地方开花结果。据北京部队和南京部队统计，到目前为止，已有九百三十七个“试验单位”；仅某军，军、师、团三级就有六百四十八人到连队搞各种试验田。人们的口号是：“哪里有困难，就向哪里去试验”。现场会议已经遍及每个角落，人们形容说是：“哪里有先进，那里就有现场会”。仅某师在3月份下半月内就召开现场会一百次，会上推广的经验有节约油、布、煤炭，教学方法，技术操作，工具改革，养猪种菜，反锦标主义，干部住班与战士四同等等，各样问题都有。现场会议的普遍召开，使许多部队出现了“一处有问题，处处注意”；“一地有先进，遍地开花”的局面。许多部队现在都已树立了第一批乃至第二、第三批标兵，做到了从班到师以至各个业务系统都有自己的标兵。人们把这种情况叫做“各有旗帜，各有奔头”。连队中的五好运动已在全军范围内展开，干部之间，单位之间都根据不同的特点和不同的内容展开评比。福州和南京部队政治部已决定今年分别搞十至十二次政治工作评比，有的还要求军、师每一个训练阶段评比一次，营连每个训练课题评比一次。这些方法实行后大大促进了比先进、学先进、赶先进的运动，使部队出现了“后浪催前浪，一浪高一浪”的雄伟局面。
    领导作风转变的另一个标志，就是不相信群众的右倾保守思想得到了扭转，使许多干部的思想得到了解放。加上群众觉悟提高和内部关系的改善，就鼓起了群众的无比革命干劲。许多以前认为办不到的事情现在办到了。“人家能做到的，我们也要做到，人家做不到的，我们试试看”，已经成为广大群众的口头语。
    现在，人们可以普遍地看到，同是一件事情，在整风以前和整风以后，许多干部有着两种不同的看法和作法。在训练方面，过去有人总认为“内容多、任务重，时间少”，不好办；今年则多数部队都提出了训练任务可以提前完成，训练内容可以增多，质量可以提高。陆军部队战术训练内容，有的部队今年计划进行的战术题目，比1956年和1957年的总和还多10％以上。计划进行合训的部队也比去年多近二倍。过去有些干部接受任务时，总是伸手向上级要人要钱，认为人越多越好，钱越多越好办事，因而造成许多人力物力的浪费，而事情却办得不一定好，有的反而办坏了。整风、双反运动打破了这种看法。人们认识到政治挂帅的深刻意义，在各种工作中充分发挥了人的积极性，钱少人少反而把事情办好了。
    过去有些同志企图单纯依靠制度来办好一切事情，不懂得制度应当依据工作需要而制定、修改甚至取消的道理。这种情况不仅高级领导机关有，某些下级机关也相当普遍。例如某团过去实行集体门诊制度，门诊时排队很长，一年中士兵因看病而缺课的达二万人次。整风初期，群众贴出大字报说：“医生看病不出门，坐在家里等病人，门前排成长蛇阵，不是治病是治人”。但是有些人却认为这是制度不能改变。经过领导上发动大家辩论：“制度为人服务，还是人为制度服务？集体门诊与医生下连哪个办法好？”结果，人们的认识改变了，医生走下了连队，这样就使缺课率减少了90％以上，发病率降低了34％，治愈率提高了35％。
