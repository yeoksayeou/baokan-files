Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: To avoid "armchair strategizing" in production internships, the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration's more than four thousand teachers and students, organized into twenty-nine geological brigades (including three hundred and fifty geological teams), have contracted geological surveying and prospecting production tasks covering more than 400,000 square kilometers during this year's summer production internship.

Now, the geological teams, holding high the red flag, are successively departing for eighteen provinces and autonomous regions in the Northwest, North, Central South, and East China regions of the motherland.

Originally, the school only planned to organize geological surveying and prospecting teams for five regions including the Taihang Mountains and the Qinling Mountains. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the vigorous development of local industry and mass mineral reporting movements in various regions urgently require the support of geological personnel. The school changed its original plan and expanded to form twenty-nine geological brigades. Among them, thirteen geological teams have entirely contracted the production tasks assigned by the state to the school's teachers and students, to seek underground treasures.

This production internship is different from the past. Its characteristics are: First, in previous production internships, due to the lack of practical knowledge of the teachers, they could not solve practical problems such as prospecting for the business departments. Instead, they argued endlessly about so-called theoretical issues such as stratigraphy and structure. Therefore, most of the geological reports or papers written were "armchair strategizing." This time, they are truly undertaking production tasks, and the teachers and students will improve their most lacking practical skills through practice. Second, through production practice, it will provide many practical topics for graduation design and scientific research. Design and research whatever is needed in production. Third, it will provide experience and materials for carrying out work-study programs and the reform of teaching plans and teaching content in the next semester. Fourth, the field team will be used as a training class, and the local mineral geology will be used as teaching material to train a group of local geological cadres, striving to have geological cadres in every township in some provinces and regions within a few years.

### 生产实习不要“纸上谈兵”  北京地质勘探学院承包测量和找矿任务

    生产实习不要“纸上谈兵”
    北京地质勘探学院承包测量和找矿任务
    据新华社29日讯　北京地质勘探学院四千多师生组成的二十九个地质大队（包括三百五十个地质小队），在今年暑期的生产实习中，承包了四十多万平方公里的地质测量和找矿的生产任务。
    现在，各地质队正高举红旗，陆续分赴祖国西北、华北、中南、华东十八个省和自治区。
    这个学校原来只准备组织太行山、秦岭等五个区域的地质测量、普查队。在生产大跃进形势下，地方工业和群众性的报矿运动蓬勃开展，各地都迫切需要地质人员的支援，学校改变了原来计划，扩大编成了二十九个地质大队。其中有十三个地质队完全由这个学校师生承包了国家交给的生产任务，寻找地下宝藏。
    这次生产实习和过去不同，它的特点是：第一，以前历届生产实习中，由于教师缺乏实际知识，不能为业务部门解决找矿等实际问题。却对地层、构造等所谓理论问题争论不休，因此写成的地质报告或论文，多数是“纸上谈兵”。这次真正担负了生产任务，师生们将通过实践，提高最缺乏的实际本领。第二，通过生产实践，将为毕业设计、科学研究提供许多具有实际意义的题材。生产中需要什么，就设计、研究什么。第三，将为下学期开展勤工俭学，教学计划、教学内容的革新，提供经验和资料。第四，实习中将以野外队作为训练班，以当地矿产地质作为教材，培养一批地方地质干部，争取几年内在某些省、区作到乡乡有地质干部。
