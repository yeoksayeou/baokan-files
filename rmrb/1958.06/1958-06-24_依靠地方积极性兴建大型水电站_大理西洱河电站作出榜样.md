Xinhua News Agency report: The Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau has adopted a method of collaborating with the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture to build the large-scale Xier River Hydropower Station, providing new experience for relying on and leveraging local initiative to accelerate the pace of industrial construction.

Located at the exit of Erhai Lake, in the Xier River in the suburbs of Xiaguan City, the capital of Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, the river has a drop of over 600 meters. With Erhai Lake as a natural reservoir, a hydropower station with a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts can be built here, serving as one of the power hubs in western Yunnan.

On the basis of the rectification movement, the Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau boldly broke with conventions in the construction of this large-scale hydropower station, changing the past situation of "fighting alone" and adopting a method of full cooperation with the local authorities. According to the agreement: the investment, equipment, materials, and technical backbone are all the responsibility of the Hydropower Engineering Bureau, while all management personnel and labor required for the project are to be allocated by the Autonomous Prefecture. During the construction process, in addition to raising the general workers to the level of junior technicians, the Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau is also responsible for training more than 500 of them into intermediate technical workers, turning the construction site into a school for the Autonomous Prefecture to train power workers, and cultivating its own technical team. After the power station is completed, it will change the previous regulations of not supplying electricity to local areas and stipulate that the electricity required by the local industry in Xiaguan City, the capital of the Autonomous Prefecture, will be supplied by the power station to support the leap forward of local industry.

Because this cooperative approach is of great benefit to the local area, the local enthusiasm for building the power station has been greatly increased. The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture has selected a deputy governor to take on the position of director of the engineering department, and after unified arrangements by the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, all the more than 2,000 laborers required for the construction site can be fully resolved.

Yunnan Province plans to build six large-scale hydropower stations during the Second Five-Year Plan. The Yunnan Hydropower Engineering Bureau has decided to continue using this method of cooperation with local authorities to enable the capital construction and production of power stations to leap forward, catching up with the needs of the province's industrial and agricultural production development.

### 依靠地方积极性兴建大型水电站  大理西洱河电站作出榜样

    依靠地方积极性兴建大型水电站
    大理西洱河电站作出榜样
    据新华社讯  云南水力发电工程局采取同大理白族自治州协作兴建西洱河大型水力发电站的办法，为依靠发挥地方积极性加快工业建设速度提供了新的经验。
    位于大理白族自治州首府下关市郊的洱海出口西洱河，落差高达六百多公尺，有洱海作为天然水库，在这里可以建立发电量达二十万瓩的水电站，作为云南西部的电力枢纽之一。
    云南水力发电工程局在整风运动的基础上，在兴建这座大型水力发电站中大胆打破常规，改变过去“孤军作战”的状况，采取了同地方充分协作的办法。根据协议：工程的投资、设备、材料和技术骨干力量，由水力发电工程局全部负责，而工程需要的全部管理人员、劳动力，则由自治州负责调配。在施工过程中，云南水力发电工程局除为自治州把一般工人提高到初级技工水平外，还要负责将其中的五百多人训练为中等技术工人，使工地变为自治州培养电力工人的学校，为自治州培养起一支自己的技术队伍。电站建成后，将改变以往不向地方供应电力的规章，而规定自治州首府下关市地方工业所需的电力由电站供给，用以支援地方工业的跃进。
    由于这种协作的办法对地方大有好处，所以地方对兴建电站的积极性大大提高。大理白族自治州已选派副州长去担负工程处长的职务，并经过自治州党委统一安排以后，工地所需的二千多个劳动力可以全部得到解决。
    云南省在第二个五年计划内共要修六座大型水电站，云南水力发电工程局已决定继续运用这种同地方协作的办法，使电站的基建和生产得以跃进，赶上全省工农业生产发展的需要。
