Hen Lays an Egg
Shi Jing Shan Power Plant Worker Chen Jie

Comrade Secretary Li’s speech was nearly over. Finally, he said: "Comrades, catching up with England depends on following the General Line! With our soaring enthusiasm and the General Line, we can’t catch up with England without these two! Recently, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power decided to build a power station at Gaojing, four miles from our plant, that will be ten times larger than ours. This project is a big opportunity. Let’s figure out how to do it more, faster, better, and more economically. Let all the workers contribute ideas and become Zhuge Liangs!"

Secretary Li's words had barely landed when the meeting hall erupted. Hu, the representative from the expansion plant, flashed out from the crowd, ran to the stage in three steps, and shouted into the microphone: "I was sitting down there, and my feet were itching. I had to say something. I'll ask one question first: is the Gaojing power station still being contracted out to the construction team? If it is still being contracted out to them, it doesn't conform to the General Line! Our plant should take on the Gaojing power station ourselves! Power plants can not only generate electricity, but also install machines. Let the hen lay an egg! Is that okay?" This question caused the whole auditorium to boil over, "Okay! - Okay!"

The sound was so loud that people's ears were buzzing. In an instant, everyone felt like they had nowhere to use their energy, like an arrow on a string. As soon as you let go, it could be shot out immediately. Doing a good job in our own factory wasn’t enough to satisfy us, we needed to lay a big egg to be satisfied. Hu, on the stage, was so anxious that he kept touching his neck, waving his hands and shouting: "Comrades, don't be chaotic! I haven't finished yet!" When the venue quieted down, Hu continued: "Ever since our plant was expanded, I have been dealing with the construction team. You are Party A, and I am Party B, as if the words were engraved on our foreheads! So clearly divided, bickering all day long. … Now the expansion project is all messed up, and we can only stare with wide eyes, unable to exert our strength. If we take on the Gaojing power station ourselves, I guarantee we can do it faster, better, and more economically than the construction team. Whether it works or not depends on everyone, but I say it will!"

The audience was stirring again. Wang, the head of the repair team, quickly discussed with the others in his team. He scanned everyone with his sharp eyes: "Hu has proposed to take on the project ourselves, what do we do? Do we dare to propose 'We will take on the installation of all the machines'?"

"Dare!" everyone said in unison.

"Good! If everyone is serious, then let Little Tiger represent us on stage. Little Tiger, hurry!"

Little Tiger had just stood up when Master Gui from the repair shop had already stepped onto the steps with one foot. Little Tiger caught up, and the two of them went on stage side by side. After going on stage, they scrambled to say "Let me speak first!" "Let me speak first!" The loudspeakers were buzzing, making the audience laugh. When the chairman of the labor union saw this, he came to mediate: "Machines should be manufactured before they are installed!" Little Tiger glared at the chairman and had no choice but to remain silent. Master Gui walked to the microphone and said loudly: "I think there's no problem with the hen laying an egg. The power plant should become an installation company, and our repair shop should become a machine manufacturing factory, working in three shifts. Whatever the power station needs, we guarantee we can produce it, except for the generator. But there is one thing: the comrades who install the equipment must install it in time, don't drag your feet!"

Master Gui finished speaking and went down. Little Tiger sat behind him, his stomach bulging with anger. He strode to the microphone: "I say to the comrades in the repair shop, don't worry about others, think more about yourselves! Don't make us stop working and wait for materials when the time comes. I represent the repair team to assure the assembly: we will take on the installation of all the machines. If there are not enough crane workers, we will train them; if there are not enough welders, we will train them, that's all. We can do what we say! When the time comes, we'll see who's dragging their feet!"

Little Tiger had just left the microphone when Da Kang from the operations field stood in front of the microphone like a telephone pole: "No matter how great your skills are, you can't generate electricity without us. After the installation is complete, we guarantee that we will train a complete set of operations personnel to fire the boilers, open the main steam valves, open the water pumps, and close the switches to send the powerful current to Beijing. It's not that we're bragging, comrades, on the day of power generation, we guarantee that the operating level will reach the world's advanced level."

The meeting was over, but people's hearts could not be calmed down. The electric lights were particularly bright tonight, and the power was particularly strong, as if the Gaojing power station was already generating electricity.

    母鸡下蛋
    石景山发电厂工人  陈捷
    李书记的传达快完了。最后他说：“同志们，赶英国，只有总路线是正道。就凭我们冲天的干劲，就凭我们的总路线，没有这两条，就不能赶英国。最近水利电力部决定要在离我们厂四里地的高井，建设一个比我们厂大十倍的电站。这个工程油水大，怎样能多快好省就怎样干，全厂职工献计献宝，都来当诸葛亮吧！”
    李书记的话刚落地，会场里就轰起来了。从人群里闪出来扩建厂方代表胡师傅，他三步两步跑到台上，对着麦克风大声嚷：“我在台下坐着，脚心直痒痒，非说不行，我先问一句：高井那个电站是不是还由工程队承包？要是还由他们承包就不合乎总路线！高井电站咱厂自己包干啦，发电厂不光会发电，也能装机器，来个母鸡下蛋！行不行？”他这一问，整个礼堂沸腾了，“行！——行！”
    这声音震得人耳朵嗡嗡响，一刹那，大家觉得浑身是劲没处使去，像上了弦的箭，只要一松手，马上就可以射出去。光做好本厂的工作那能满足？不下个大蛋不过瘾。台上的胡师傅急得直摸脖子，一边挥手一边喊：“同志们别乱！我还没说完哪！”等会场静下来，胡师傅接着说：“打咱厂一扩建，我就跟工程队打交道。你是甲方的，我是乙方的，好像脑门子上刻着字！分得那个清啊，整天扯皮。……现在扩建工程正歪泥，我们只能瞪着大眼珠看，使不上劲。高井的电站要是我们自己包下来，保证比工程队干得又快、又好、又省。行不行看大家的了，我说行！”
    台下又骚动起来。检修班王班长赶紧和全班的几个人商量，他那锐利的眼光向大家一扫：“胡师傅提出包干，我们怎办？咱们敢不敢提出‘全部机器安装我们包’？”
    “敢！”大家异口同声的说。
    “好！要是大家真不含糊，就叫小老虎代表我们上台。小老虎，快！”
    小老虎刚站起来，修配厂的贵师傅一支脚已蹬上了台阶，小老虎赶上去，两个人并肩上了台，上台后又抢着说“让我先说！”“让我先说！”震的喇叭吵吵直响，逗的台下直笑。工会主席见了过来解围：“装机器也应该先制造，后安装啊！”小老虎瞪了主席一眼，只好不说什么。贵师傅一步走向麦克风前，大声说：“我看呀，母鸡下蛋没问题。发电厂要变安装公司，我们修配场要变成机器制造场，分三班干。电站需要什么，我们保证拿出什么来，除了发电机。可有一样，我们造出来的设备，安装的同志们可得及时装好，别扯后脚！”
    贵师傅说完下去了。小老虎坐在后面气的肚子鼓鼓的，他一个箭步就跨到麦克风面前来：“我说修配厂的同志们，别替别人耽忧啦，还是多想想自己吧！临阵别叫我们停工待料。我代表检修班向大会保证：我们包下全部机器安装。起重工不够，我们会培养；电焊工不够，我们也会培养，这都不在话下，我们说得到就办得到！到时候看到底谁是扯后脚的！”
    小老虎刚离开麦克风，运行场的大康就跟电线杆子似的立在麦克风前：“你们有天大的本事，没我们也发不了电。等安装好了，我们保证培养出全套的运行人材，去烧锅炉，去开大汽门，去开水泵，去合闸，把强大的电流送到北京。不是我们吹牛，同志们，到发电那一天，保证运行水平达到世界先进水平”。
    会散了，人们的心不能平静，今天晚上的电灯特别亮，电力特别强，好像高井电站已经在发电了。
