Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, when discussing the summit conference issue at a press conference on the 17th, admitted that the U.S. was employing obstructive tactics in the ongoing preparatory talks. He said that the U.S. believes various "major issues" should be discussed in the preparatory talks, "although it seems there is no possibility of reaching an agreement." "Therefore, we have raised these various issues and requested the Soviet Union to express its opinions on these issues." At the same time, he blamed the Soviet Union, insisting that Khrushchev's recent letter to the heads of Western countries, exposing the West's obstructive tactics, was "intended to interrupt the preparations [for the summit conference]." Dulles more explicitly than before disseminated pessimistic views about the summit conference. He said, "I don't want to predict whether such a meeting is possible this year."

Dulles indicated that the U.S. does not intend to undertake obligations to halt nuclear testing based on any agreement that may be reached in the technical negotiations on the supervision of nuclear tests. He stated that any agreement reached on inspection methods does not mean that the U.S. is obliged to stop nuclear testing; this will still depend on other factors in disarmament issues.

Dulles expressed regret and sadness over the execution of Hungarian counter-revolutionary leader Imre Nagy and others, and used this as an opportunity to maliciously slander the People's Republic of Hungary and the Soviet Union.

    杜勒斯谈最高级会议的预备会谈
    承认美国玩弄阻挠伎俩
    据新华社18日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯17日在记者招待会上谈到最高级会议问题时，承认美国在正在进行的预备会谈中玩弄阻挠策略。他说，美国认为在预备会谈中应该讨论各种“重大问题”，“尽管看来并没有达成协议的可能”。“因此，我们提出了这些各种各样的问题，并且要求苏联对这些问题表示意见”。同时，他又反咬一口，硬把苏联最近公布的赫鲁晓夫给西方国家首脑揭露西方这种阻挠策略的信说成是“想要中断（最高级会议的）准备工作”。杜勒斯比以前更露骨地散布对最高级会议的悲观论调。他说，“我不想预言到底今年是否可能举行这种会议。”
    杜勒斯表示美国不打算根据就监督核试验进行的技术谈判可能达成的协议承担停止核试验的义务。他表示，关于视察方法所达成的任何协议并不意味着美国有义务停止核试验，这还要取决于裁军问题中的其他因素。
    杜勒斯对匈牙利反革命首脑纳吉等人的被处决表示遗憾和伤心，他并且借此对匈牙利人民共和国和苏联进行恶毒的污蔑。
