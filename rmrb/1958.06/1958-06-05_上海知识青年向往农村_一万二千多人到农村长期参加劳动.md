　　Shanghai Intellectual Youth Aspire to the Countryside
    More Than 12,000 People Go to the Countryside to Participate in Long-Term Labor

    (Our newspaper reporter Liu Renjie reports) On the afternoon of May 16th, at the Shiliupu Wharf on the Huangpu River in Shanghai, more than 900 young people, determined to dedicate their youth to agricultural construction, happily bid farewell to their relatives and friends and boarded a ship to sail to Anhui. This was the last group of the 12,000 Shanghai intellectual youth volunteering to participate in agricultural construction in Hubei and Anhui to depart.

    Aspiring to the Countryside: A Trend Has Formed

    After the tempering of the rectification movement, people's spiritual outlook has changed. Previously, many young people in Shanghai were nostalgic for city life and looked down on agricultural labor, but now, with the improvement of their ideological awareness, loving labor and aspiring to the countryside has become a common trend.

    From the second half of last year to now, more than 20,000 intellectual youths have participated in agricultural labor. The number of young people volunteering to go to the countryside has increased each time. In August and September of last year, only more than 1,000 people signed up to participate in agricultural labor in the suburbs of Shanghai. This February, the number increased to more than 13,800 people who signed up to participate in the construction of the sea dike in Fengxian, Jiangsu. And this recent time, more than 22,000 people signed up to support agricultural construction in Hubei and Anhui within the first three days.

    Young people regard participating in agricultural labor as the greatest happy event. As soon as the news spread, gongs and drums were beaten everywhere, and people ran around to tell each other. Several days before the registration began, resolution letters and guarantees from intellectual youths were posted all over the street offices and neighborhood committees in the city. Many young people queued up as early as 11 o'clock the night before in order to fill in the number one registration form. Touching examples of sisters competing to be first and parents sending their children off emerged one after another.

    Not to Be Delicate Flowers, But to Be Pines and Cypresses

    During the upsurge of socialist transformation in 1956, the children of Shanghai capitalists issued oaths not to be successors of the bourgeoisie. Now they have put forward the slogan "Don't be flowers in a greenhouse, but pines and cypresses in wind and frost," not afraid of hardship, not nostalgic for enjoyment, determined to be cultured laborers. In Xuhui District, there is a high school graduate named Qi Daogeng. Her father is the private factory director of Youning Pharmaceutical Factory, and her mother is a medical worker. She is weak and often ill, and her mother often gives her tonics. Her parents dote on her and usually don't let her run around outside, always letting her read books and play chess at home, and even going to the movies requires her mother's consent. In recent months, Qi Daogeng participated in the rectification work in the neighborhood, writing big-character posters, taking notes, carrying soil, and planting trees, leaving early and returning late every day. After leaving home, Qi Daogeng became cheerful, and her family saw that her health was much better than before, and they were all very happy. This time, she actively requested to go to the countryside. At first, her mother was a little worried, so she inquired about several young people who had settled in the suburbs not long ago, one of whom was her cousin. These young people were not in good health before, but now they have become dark and strong, and are very happy. Qi Daogeng's mother said with emotion: "In the past, I kept my child at home. Now it seems that this method of education is wrong. She should be allowed to exercise and labor." On May 4th, Qi Daogeng's parents went to the dock together to see off their daughter, who had never been out of the house, and told her to overcome all difficulties and train herself well. Now Qi Daogeng has arrived in Hubei. In order to do more things in the countryside, she also learned injection and first aid techniques from her mother before leaving.

    The Countryside Is Lovely, Labor Is Pleasant

    The first few batches of Shanghai intellectual youths who participated in labor have not only initially developed the habit of labor after several months of labor training, but also began to change in their thoughts and feelings, and have deeply fallen in love with the countryside. They often write letters to their relatives and friends and classmates to report on their labor and living conditions. These letters not only brought joy and comfort to their parents, but also encouraged more young people to go to the countryside. Wu Xiuhua, the daughter of a capitalist who settled in Anhui last year, wrote to her friend Wei Songhua: "One and a half months of labor life can be said to be bitter and sweet. The bitterness is that we are not yet accustomed to labor, and the sweetness is that after hard labor, we have gained a lot. My hands have already grown a thick layer of calluses, but hands with thick calluses are always better than snow-white and tender hands. When I come back from work in the evening, I have a panoramic view of the green mountains, and I forget the fatigue of the day, and I can't help but sing the song I don't know: We work hard for a happy life... ." Now Wei Songhua has also gone to Anhui. A few days ago, she wrote enthusiastically to her parents to report on her new life.

    Now, tens of thousands of intellectual youths are still waiting for the countryside to summon them again. Those who have not been approved this time have repeatedly run to the street offices and the district committees of the Communist Youth League, asking to be approved next time. Many people have prepared their luggage, and some have also talked to the classmates who have already gone to the countryside, asking them to ask the local agricultural cooperatives to allow them to settle down.

### 上海知识青年向往农村  一万二千多人到农村长期参加劳动

　　上海知识青年向往农村
    一万二千多人到农村长期参加劳动
    本报讯　记者刘人杰报道：5月16日下午，上海黄浦江边的十六铺码头上，立志把青春献给农业建设的九百多个青年愉快地向亲友们告别，登上轮船乘风破浪地向安徽驶去。这是志愿参加湖北、安徽农业建设的一万二千个上海知识青年中最后出发的一批。
    向往农村　已成风气
    经过整风运动的洗礼，人们的精神面貌发生了变化。以前，上海青年中有不少人留恋城市生活，轻视农业劳动，而现在，随着思想觉悟的提高，热爱劳动、向往农村已经成为一种普遍的风气。
    从去年下半年到现在，已先后有两万多知识青年参加了农业劳动。志愿到农村去的青年一次比一次多，去年8、9月报名参加上海市郊农业劳动的只有一千多人，今年2月报名参加江苏奉贤修海塘劳动的增至一万三千八百多人，而最近这一次报名支援湖北、安徽农业建设的，头三天内就有二万二千多人。
    青年们把参加农业劳动看作最大的喜事，消息一传出就到处敲锣打鼓、奔走相告。在开始报名几天之前，全市各街道办事处和居民委员会就贴满了知识青年的决心书和保证书。不少青年为了要填第一号报名单，在前一天晚上十一点钟就去排队等候了。姐妹争先、父母送儿的生动事例层出不穷。
    不作娇花　要作松柏
    1956年社会主义改造高潮的时候，上海资本家的子女发出了不做资产阶级继承人的誓言，如今他们又提出口号，“不做暖房中的花朵，要做风霜中的松柏”，不害怕艰苦，不留恋享受，立志做一个有文化的劳动者。徐汇区有一个叫戚道赓的高中毕业生，她的父亲是友宁药厂的私方厂长，母亲是个医务工作者。她体弱多病，妈妈常常给她打补针，父母溺爱她，平时不放心她到外面去跑，总是让她在家里看书、下棋，连出去看一场电影也必须得到母亲的同意。近几个月来戚道赓参加了里弄整风工作，写大字报、做记录，挑土、种树，每天早出晚归。走出家门以后，戚道赓变得开朗起来，家里人看到她的身体反倒比以前健康多了，也都很高兴。这次她积极要求到农村去，起初妈妈有点放心不下，她去打听了几个不久前到市郊落户的青年，其中一个是自己的堂妹，这些青年原来的身体也不大好，现在变得又黑又棒，精神很愉快。戚道赓的妈妈感慨地说：“以前我把孩子关在屋里，现在看来这种教育方法是不对的，应该让她去锻炼，去劳动。”5月4日，戚道赓的爸爸妈妈一道到码头上来欢送他们从来没有出过门的女儿，嘱咐她克服一切困难，好好锻炼自己。现在戚道赓已经到达湖北了。她为了到农村多做点事情，在临走以前还向妈妈学会了注射和急救的技术。
    农村可爱　劳动愉快
    前几批参加劳动的上海知识青年，经过几个月的劳动锻炼，不但初步养成了劳动的习惯，而且在思想感情上也开始发生变化，深深地爱上了农村。他们经常来信向亲友和同学报告自己劳动和生活的情况。这些信件不但给家长带来了喜悦和安慰，而且也鼓舞着更多的青年走向农村。去年到安徽落户的资本家女儿吴秀华，给她的女友魏颂华的信上说：“一个半月的劳动生活可以说是有苦有甜，苦的是劳动还不习惯，甜的是经过艰苦的劳动，我们有了很多收获。我的手上已经磨出一层厚厚的老茧了，但是有厚茧的手总比雪白粉嫩的手要好得多。晚上收工回来，饱览山上的一片苍绿，我忘记了一天的疲劳，情不自禁地唱起了那支我不知名的歌：我们努力的工作是为了幸福的生活……。”现在魏颂华也已经到安徽去了。几天前热情洋溢地写信向爸妈报告了自己的新生活。
    现在，成千上万的知识青年，还在等待着农村的再一次召唤。这次没有被批准的人，都一再跑到街道办事处和团区委去，要求下次一定批准他们。不少人已经准备好行装，有的还和已经下乡的同学谈好，托他请求当地的农业社准许自己去安家落户。（附图片）
