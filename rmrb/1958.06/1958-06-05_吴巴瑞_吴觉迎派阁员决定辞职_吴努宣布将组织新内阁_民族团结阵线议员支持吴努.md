According to a report in today's "Nation" newspaper of Rangoon, prior to the cabinet members issuing their resignation statements, approximately one hundred and fifty members of the two houses of the Burmese Parliament met at U Ba Swe's residence to study the political situation since the split within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League between the U Nu-Thakin Tin faction and the U Ba Swe-U Kyaw Nyein faction. Sources say that those attending the meeting unanimously guaranteed their support for U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein.

At the same time, one hundred and twenty-nine members of the Burmese Chamber of Deputies met at U Nu's residence and signed their names to express their support for the U Nu-Thakin Tin faction. Among them, members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and ethnic minority deputies, in the signing ceremony, expressed their belief that U Nu could complete the work of rectifying the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League and realize national unity, peace, democracy, and friendly international relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 3rd: Members of Parliament of the Burmese National United Front issued a joint statement at a press conference on June 2nd, saying that they would support the U Nu-Thakin Tin faction at the upcoming meeting of the Burmese Chamber of Deputies.
