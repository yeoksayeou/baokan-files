Introduce More Experiences in Leading the Technical Revolution

People all over the country are responding to the call of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and are vigorously engaging in the technical revolution. It is hoped that the People's Daily will publish more experiences of local grassroots organizations in strengthening the organizational leadership, propaganda mobilization, and ideological and political work of the technical revolution, so as to learn from each other, draw on strengths, overcome weaknesses, and improve together.

    多介绍领导技术革命的经验
    全国各地人民正在响应党的“八大”二次会议的号召，大闹技术革命。希望人民日报多刊登各地基层组织如何加强技术革命工作的组织领导、宣传鼓动、思想政治工作的经验，以便作到互相学习，取长补短，共同提高。
