    (This newspaper) News: In Longyan County, Fujian Province, a famous old revolutionary base area with a long tradition of singing mountain songs, mountain songs have developed into dramas and been brought to the stage.
    The mountain song opera of Longyan County is a form of opera art that uses local popular mountain song tunes, plus music and makeup. Generally, people can compose, sing, and perform. It can also quickly reflect real life. Therefore, it is warmly welcomed by the local masses, and it also plays a significant role in enriching people's cultural life and carrying out political and production propaganda. The cultural departments of Longyan County have successively helped amateur mountain song opera troupes train a large number of key personnel, enriched the troupe's singing materials, continued to explore and sort out various new mountain songs, and absorbed the performing arts of other local opera types, so that this new opera type can be further improved on the basis of popularization.
