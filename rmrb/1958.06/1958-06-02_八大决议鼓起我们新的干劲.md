　　The Eight Great Resolutions Inspire Our New Drive
　　By our correspondent Sun Yuedong
    After the "Eight Great" resolutions were relayed to the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in Xincheng Township, Guanxian County, Sichuan Province, the cooperative members were greatly encouraged. They said: "After Chairman Mao visited our cooperative in March, we were greatly motivated; now, the Party's Eighth National Congress resolutions have inspired a new drive in us!"
    In the Fields Before Dawn, Night Battles After Dark: Rice Transplanting Speed Doubles
    Happiness Cooperative is Lotus First Cooperative, which Chairman Mao visited on his way back from inspecting the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. On the 30th, when I arrived at this cooperative, the female members were threshing wheat in various courtyards. Although the threshing was not yet complete, the members pointed to the wheat stacks in front of and behind the houses and told me that this was an unprecedented bumper harvest. One member told me that the wheat field that Chairman Mao estimated could yield 400 jin actually yielded 456 jin per mu, and this field was representative of the average. In the fields, male members were delivering fertilizer, plowing, and transplanting rice seedlings. Because the method of planting in rows with close spacing was widely adopted, the number of rice seedling nests per mu was more than double that of last year, making this year's transplanting work even more intense and busy. Inspired by the "Eight Great" resolutions, the members recently decided to complete the remaining 200-plus mu of rice transplanting in eight days through a concentrated effort. The members showed a new drive, going to the fields before dawn and launching a "night battle" after dinner, doing some work that did not require technical specifications by feeling their way in the dark, thus accelerating the planting speed by more than double. The transplanting time will be shortened by more than ten days compared to last year.
    Used to Roam the Streets, Now Roaming the Fields: Lazy People Become Diligent People
    On the ridge, I found cooperative member Ran Guiquan, who was irrigating and fertilizing. Other members had told me beforehand that if you want to know the changes in the members, just look at Ran Guiquan. He is a typical figure. Ran Guiquan is the young man who talked with Chairman Mao in the wheat field. He used to be known for his laziness, going to the market for tea every day and rarely doing any work. Since he met Chairman Mao that time, he has changed, vowing to be a diligent person, do a good job in production, and repay Chairman Mao's concern. Now, he is the irrigation manager of the seventh team, responsible for the water irrigation of more than 60 mu of land. Every day, he runs to the ridges to manage the water before dawn, and he has to go to the fields to check until midnight, making at least seven or eight rounds a day. Ran Guiquan said: "In previous years, I roamed the streets, but now I am roaming the fields!" In addition to managing water, he also actively participates in accumulating and transporting fertilizer. So far, he has earned more than 1,000 work points, while at this time last year, he had only earned 300 work points. He said: "Go all out, aim high, and I will definitely manage the water well, adopt advanced technology for shallow water irrigation in all areas, ensure a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu, and strive to become a model member."
    Meeting Chairman Mao Opens Up Thinking: Wang Jiafu Learns New Technology
    Speaking of technological innovation in the cooperative, the members like to cite the example of Wang Jiafu. Wang Jiafu, who has twenty years of plowing experience, originally had resistance to the new-style plow and was unwilling to change the old farm tools. Since the day he met Chairman Mao and shook hands with him, his thinking has broadened. When the cooperative discussed how to achieve a great leap forward in production, he took the initiative to try the new-style walking plow, because he knew that it was difficult to achieve deep plowing with the old-style plow. In order to learn to master the new-style walking plow, he went to the state-owned farm for advice for three consecutive days. Now, he is leading the members to use the new-style walking plow. When I visited him, he explained to me in great detail the principles and advantages of the new-style walking plow, which can plow deeper and more evenly. He told me that in order to be able to transplant rice seedlings in advance, he plowed the fields under the moonlight until midnight every day, and then leveled and harrowed the fields the next morning; this way, the work was done quickly and well. When I went to visit him, I waited a long time for him to come home. It turned out that after plowing the fields, he went to graze the cattle.
    Accumulate More Fertilizer, Harvest More Grain: Strive for a Yield of 2,000 Jin per Mu
    On the evening of the 30th, Happiness Cooperative held a meeting to review the current production situation in accordance with the "Eight Great" resolutions. The cooperative had already exceeded the plan of accumulating 120,000 jin of fertilizer per household, which was revised after Chairman Mao's visit. In order to prepare sufficient topdressing fertilizer for rice and to prepare early for fertilizer for next year's winter crops, a short-term concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign of 10,000 jin of green manure per household was launched immediately after transplanting. The cooperative is determined to achieve a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu as a specific target for implementing the "Eight Great" resolutions. The members swore: "Our determination is like that of the Foolish Old Man, our energy is like that of Wu Song, when we encounter difficulties, we think of the Long March (the spirit of the Red Army overcoming difficulties), and we offer plans and strategies like Zhuge Liang."

### 八大决议鼓起我们新的干劲

　　八大决议鼓起我们新的干劲
　　本报记者　孙跃冬
    “八大”决议传到四川省灌县新城乡幸福农业社以后，社员们受到很大的鼓舞。他们说：“3月间，毛主席来过我们社里以后，我们鼓起了很大的干劲；现在，党的八大决议，又鼓舞起我们新的干劲！”
    天亮前下田　天黑后夜战  插秧速度加快一倍
    幸福社就是毛主席参观都江堰归来的路上访问过的莲花一社。30日这天，我赶到这个社的时候，女社员们正在各个院坝里打麦子，虽然还没有打完，但社员指着屋前屋后的麦垛告诉我，这是从来没有过的丰收景象。一个社员告诉我，毛主席估计能收四百斤的那块麦田，每亩收了四百五十六斤，这块田能代表一般。在田野里，男社员们正在送肥料、犁田、插秧。由于普遍采用了条栽密植，每亩的秧窝比去年增加了两倍以上，因而今年的插秧活路更加紧张繁忙。在“八大”决议的鼓舞下，社员们最近决定以八天时间突击完成剩下的两百多亩田的插秧工作。社员们拿出新的干劲，天不亮就下田，吃了晚饭还要来一场“夜战”，摸索着干一些不讲究技术规格的活路，因而使栽插速度加快一倍多。比去年的插秧时间还缩短十多天。
    往年街上转　现在田里转  懒散人变成勤快人
    在田坎上，我找到了正在灌水施肥的社员冉贵全。事前别的社员告诉我，要想知道社员们的变化，只要看看冉贵全就行了，他是一个典型人物，冉贵全，就是曾和毛主席在麦田里谈过话的那个青年人。以前，他是以懒散著名的，天天赶场吃茶，很少作活路。自从那次见过毛主席以后，他就有了转变，发誓要作个勤快人，搞好生产，报答毛主席的关怀。现在，他当上了七队的灌溉管理员，负责六十多亩田的用水灌溉。每天天不亮就跑到田坎上去管理水，直到半夜还要到田边上去察看，一天至少要转七、八圈。冉贵全说：“往年是在街上转，现在我是在田里转了！”除了管理用水，他还积极参加积肥、运肥，到目前他已挣得一千多个工分，而去年这时他才得到三百个工分。他说：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，我一定把水管理好，全部采用先进技术进行浅水灌溉，保证每亩产粮双千斤，争取当上个模范社员。
    见到毛主席　思想开朗了  王嘉福学会新技术
    提起社里的技术改革，社员们就喜欢举社员王嘉福的例子。这个有二十年犁田经验的王嘉福，本来是对新式犁有抵触思想，不肯改变旧农具的。自从那天他见到毛主席，并和毛主席握了手以后，他的思想开朗了。在社里讨论如何使生产大跃进的时候，他主动来试一试新式步犁，因为他深知用旧式犁作到深耕是困难的。为了学习掌握新式步犁，他接连三天跑到国营农场去请教。现在，他带动社员使用新式步犁。当我访问他时，他很细致地向我谈了新式步犁能耕得深、耕得平整的道理和优点。他告诉我，为了能作到提前栽秧，他每天都在月亮下面犁田到半夜，第二天天明，再把田整平耙细；这样活路作得又快又好。当我去访问他的时候，等了许久他都不回家来。原来在犁完田以后，他又去放牛了。
    积更多的肥　收更多的粮  亩产要达到两千斤
    30日晚上，幸福社召开了会议，根据“八大”决议，检查了当前生产。全社在毛主席走后修订的每户积肥十二万斤计划已超额完成，为了准备充足的水稻追肥和为明年小春作物用肥提早作好准备，在栽秧之后，立即掀起一个每户积青草肥一万斤的短期突击积肥运动。全社决心实现每亩产粮双千斤，作为贯彻执行“八大”决议的具体指标。社员们宣誓说：“我们的决心像愚公，我们的劲头像武松，遇到困难想长征（红军长征克服困难的精神），谋策献计比孔明。”
