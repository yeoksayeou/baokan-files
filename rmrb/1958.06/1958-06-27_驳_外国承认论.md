    Refuting the "Foreign Recognition Theory"
    Zhou Chiguang

    Those who are superstitious about foreign countries have various arguments. The so-called "Foreign Recognition Theory" is one of them.

    In the midst of the cultural Great Leap Forward, teachers at a certain university planted red flags, vowing to catch up with or even surpass the world level in scientific research. This communist spirit of breaking down superstition and daring to think, speak, and act should be respected and encouraged. However, some so-called "Foreign Recognition Theory" advocates don't see it that way. They say coldly:

    "Humph! World level is not self-proclaimed. It only counts if it is recognized by foreigners." Some even say, "If your scientific research cannot solve world problems and doesn't help foreign countries, if they don't translate your books, or at least their libraries don't have your works, then you can't presumptuously claim to have reached world level."

    According to these people's logic, Li Shimei's discovery of the water absorption line of termites, which solved the problem of radically curing termites that foreign entomologists couldn't solve, and has achieved remarkable results in eliminating termite hazards in southern China, cannot be "self-proclaimed" as having reached world level because it has not yet been recognized by foreigners and has not solved foreign problems. Only when Li Shimei's research papers (I don't know if Comrade Li Shimei has written such papers?) are translated into foreign languages and foreigners give their approval, can it be considered valid.

    How absurd and ridiculous this logic is!

    Of course, world level is not self-proclaimed, but it should not be contingent upon foreign recognition. The world level of scientific research has its own objective standards. This standard is the practice of the people. The practice of millions of people proves to be the most correct, and that is the world's most advanced level. Our scientific research is not for "world level" for the sake of "world level," but to better serve socialist construction. Those scientific researchers are valuable not because of their self-proclamation, and they have not self-proclaimed in this way, but because they dare to take "world level" as the goal and requirement of their scientific research, and because of their indomitable revolutionary spirit. "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." Who dares to say that they will not achieve their goals!

    According to the logic of the "Foreign Recognition Theory" advocates, it would be difficult for our people not only to reach the world level in scientific research, but even to live on this earth. On September 21, 1949, Chairman Mao said in his opening address at the People's Political Consultative Conference: "The Chinese people have now stood up." Those "Foreign Recognition Theory" advocates would say: "Standing up" is also not "self-proclaimed," it only counts if it is "recognized" and approved by "foreigners." But what if the United States and its followers do not recognize China? Should we just lie back down?

    These so-called "Foreign Recognition Theories" mostly come from bourgeois "famous professors" and "old experts." This is originally understandable and not surprising. Because they were raised on foreign milk, they are superstitious about foreign countries, believing that the sky in foreign countries is higher than in China, and the moon in foreign countries is rounder than in China. However, a small part also comes from those who claim to be revolutionaries. The slavishness of these Jia Guis is the same. We should advise them to completely get rid of their own slavishness.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "Our country has suffered from the oppression of foreign invaders for more than a hundred years, resulting in backwardness in many aspects. Although it has now been liberated and has achieved rapid development in all aspects, many people's mental state still bears the imprint of the oppressed, and their minds are still filled with all kinds of superstitions, fears, and inferiority complexes." I think that Comrade Shaoqi's words perfectly illustrate the historical and ideological origins of these "Foreign Recognition Theory" advocates.

    驳“外国承认论” 
    周赤光
    迷信外国的，有各种各样的论调。所谓“外国承认论”者，就是其中的一种。
    在文化大跃进中，某大学教师们插红旗：要在科学研究上，赶上甚至超过世界水平。这种破除迷信，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义高尚风格，理应受到人们的尊敬和鼓舞。可是，有一种所谓“外国承认论”者，却不这样。他们冷言冷语地说：
    “哼！世界水平，不是自封的。要外国承认，才能算数。”有的还说：“如果你的科学研究，不能解决世界的问题，对外国没有帮助，人家不翻译你的书，至少图书馆里没有你的著作，就不能妄称达到世界水平。”
    按照这些人的逻辑，李始美发现白蚁的吸水线，解决了外国昆虫学家不能解决的根治白蚁的问题，并在我国南方消除白蚁危害的实践中，取得了显著的效果，但因为暂时还没有得到外国的承认，也没有解决外国的问题，就“不能自封”为已达到世界水平。只有当李始美的研究论文（不知李始美同志写过这种论文么？）被译成外国文，要外国人点了头，这才能够算数。
    这种逻辑，何等荒谬、何等可笑啊！
    当然，世界水平，不是自封的，但也绝不能依外国的承认与否为转移。科学研究的世界水平有它自己客观标准。这标准就是人民的实践。千百万人民的实践证明了是最正确的，它就是世界最先进的水平。我们的科学研究，不是为“世界水平”而“世界水平”，而是为了更好地为社会主义建设服务。那些科学研究者之所以可贵，不在于他们的自封，他们也没有这样自封，而在于他们敢于把“世界水平”作为对自己科学研究的目标和要求，在于他们那种势如破竹的革命气概。“天下无难事，只怕有心人。”谁敢断言，不会达到自己的目标呢！
    按照“外国承认论”者的逻辑，我国人民不但不能在科学研究上达到世界水平，就是要在地球上生活下去，都很困难了。1949年9月21日，毛主席在人民政协会议上的开幕词中说：“中国人民从此站立起来了。”那些“外国承认论”者就会说：“站立起来”也不是“自封的”，要“外国承认”、点头，才能算数。但是，美国和它的追随者不承认中国，怎么办呢？我们就只好仍旧躺倒么？
    这些所谓“外国承认论”，大部分来自资产阶级“名教授”、“老专家”。这原是可以理解不足为奇。因为，他们是靠外国的奶汁养大的，所以迷信外国，认为外国的天空要比中国的高，外国的月亮要比中国的圆。但是，也有一小部分出自自命为革命者之口。这些贾桂们的奴隶性是相同的。我们应该奉劝他们彻底革掉自己的奴隶性。
    刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议的报告中说：“我们的国家曾经遭受外国侵略者一百多年的压迫，造成许多方面的落后状态，现在虽然解放了，并在各方面有了飞跃的发展，但是不少人的精神状态还带着被压迫者的烙印，头脑里还装满了种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感。”我想，少奇同志的话，正好说明了这些“外国承认论”者的历史根源和思想根源。
