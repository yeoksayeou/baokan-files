To promote the rapid development of summer production, Guizhou province is launching a grand competition among townships and communes.

    (Based on a report from this newspaper) The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China discussed the current situation and problems in summer agricultural production on the 17th and decided to take four key measures to promote the rapid development of the summer agricultural production movement.

    These measures are: First, launch a red banner competition movement throughout the province, requiring every township and commune to organize advanced red banner competitions in a timely manner, with the province organizing a major crop evaluation before the autumn harvest. Second, launch a summer manure accumulation movement, including fermenting green manure, accumulating animal manure and compost, and manufacturing local fertilizers, partly for topdressing during the major growing season and partly in preparation for autumn plowing and planting. Third, actively increase the planting of tuber crops. Fourth, carry out deep plowing, land leveling, and terracing of sloping land to conserve water and soil and improve the soil. In addition, the meeting pointed out the need to pay attention to water storage and leverage the role of newly built water conservancy projects this year; it is necessary to check the growth of rice, corn, and other crops, and promptly replant or transplant where seedlings are missing.
