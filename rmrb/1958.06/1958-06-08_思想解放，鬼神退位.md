　　Ideological Emancipation, Gods and Spirits Retreat
　　Liu Di
    A struggle to break superstitions and liberate thought is surging into every corner of the country. This struggle is changing the face of nature and also changing people's ideological outlook. Many old customs and traditions that bound people's minds, and all kinds of "authorities" and "idols," are being rapidly swept away by the great torrent of communist thought.
    In the countryside, unheard-of deeds are appearing: Peasants in the Chao-Shan area of Guangdong, in order to level land, transform the soil, and expand the cultivated area, have begun to dig up the graves of their ancestors and bury them together in public cemeteries. Those coffins and steles are used to build bridges, pave roads, build melon sheds, and repair pigsties. The slightly sturdier coffins are excellent materials for making cartwheels. Advanced farmers no longer believe in ghosts and gods, and no longer bind themselves to various old habits and traditions. They say heroically: "Let our ancestors come and join us in construction!"
    This great transformation of customs and earth-shaking changes are rapidly spreading across the country. Members of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, built a "collective cemetery," with a couplet written on both sides of the archway: "The whole cooperative works together for production, and ancestors of different surnames are worshiped in the same hall." After rectification, 600,000 people in Nan'an County, Fujian Province, changed the superstitious and wasteful habit of celebrating the "Buddha's Birthday" that had existed throughout history, saving more than 3 million yuan, 5.6 million catties of grain, and 940,000 workdays a year. The Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou has a tradition passed down from generations of eating "bulls." People feed those "bulls" with wine and food every day. These "bulls" are not used for farming but are specially used for "bullfighting" and slaughter. Each agricultural cooperative has dozens or even hundreds of them, and a large number are slaughtered every three years. Now people swear not to eat "bulls" anymore. So on and so forth, new changes are rising in great numbers. According to superstition, rivers have river gods, mountains have mountain gods, heaven has the Jade Emperor, the earth has land gods, and the sea has the Dragon King. There is endless paper incense to burn, endless scriptures to recite, and old conventions and habits are layered upon each other, binding people's thoughts. However, with a cry of great leap forward, people suddenly broke free from these constraints, and ghosts and gods immediately abdicated.
    In the past, many people believed in ghosts, gods, and heaven, with "heaven" dominating everything. However, today people believe in people, in the labor and creation of the people themselves, truly believing that "man will conquer nature."
    Peasants in Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, composed a clapper rhyme that sings:
    There is no Jade Emperor in heaven, no Dragon King on earth;
    I am the Jade Emperor, I am the Dragon King.
    Commanding the mountains and ridges to open the way:
    Here I come.
    This not only reflects the heroic spirit of the working people in transforming nature, but also shows that people understand in the practice of labor that man is the master of nature, that the people are capable of liberating themselves, and that labor and creation are reliable forces for seeking liberation. Once superstition is broken, not only are people's thoughts liberated, but also unparalleled wisdom and strong productivity are liberated along with it.
    Speaking of superstition, of course, the number of people who burn incense, recite scriptures, pray to gods, and worship Buddha all day long is, after all, very small now. However, the old customs and almanacs left over from feudal superstition still bind people's thoughts. Don't we still hear people pointing fingers and talking loudly about this not conforming to the rules, that not conforming to tradition, and other old-fashioned arguments? These people dare not think, nor dare to do, they can only follow the old rules all day long, resigning themselves to fate, for fear of violating that "old" character. According to these people's old almanacs, we don't need to work hard and practically to make revolution, we just need to burn more incense and kowtow more, and socialism will fall from the sky.
    However, history always moves forward according to objective laws of development, and no forces of tradition and habit can stop it. Break superstitions, liberate thought, no longer believe in gods and ghosts, but believe in the power of people. This is a struggle between dialectical materialism and idealism, advanced thought and backward conservative thought. "Believing in ghosts and gods" is naturally wrong; "respecting ghosts and gods and keeping them at a distance" is an even more passive and compromising attitude. What we advocate is: a scientific mind, a style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, to thoroughly liberate ourselves from all kinds of superstitions.

### 思想解放，鬼神退位

　　思想解放，鬼神退位
　　柳地
    一场破除迷信、解放思想的斗争，正在汹涌到全国每个角落里。这场斗争，改变着自然界的面貌，也改变着人们的思想面貌。许许多多束缚人们头脑的旧风俗、老传统，各式各样的“权威”和“偶像”，被共产主义思想的巨大洪流迅速冲垮了。
    在农村中，出现了这样不曾听闻的事迹：广东潮汕地区的农民，为了平整土地，改造土壤，扩大耕地面积，动手把祖先的坟墓翻掘起来，合葬到公墓里去。那些棺木和石碑，用来筑桥、铺路、搭瓜棚、修猪圈，稍微坚固一点的棺木，更是造车轮子的好材料。先进的农民们，再也不迷信鬼神，再也不自缚于种种旧的习惯和传统。他们豪迈地说：“让祖先也来和我们一起进行建设吧！”
    这场移风易俗、翻天覆地的大变革，在全国各地迅速地蔓延开了。山西潞安县金星农业社的社员们修建了一所“集体坟园”，牌坊两侧写着“全社齐心搞生产，异姓一堂奉祖先”的对联。福建南安县六十万人民经过整风，改变了有史以来过“佛诞”的迷信浪费习惯，一年能节约三百多万元、粮食五百六十万斤、劳力九十四万个工日。贵州苗族、侗族自治州祖代相传就有吃“牯?牛”的习惯，人们每天用酒饭饲养那些不耕田而专门用来“斗牛”和宰杀的“牯?牛”，每个农业社都有数十头，甚至数百头，每隔三年就大量宰杀一次，现在人们宣誓不再吃“牯?牛”。如此等等，新的变革，正在风起云涌。按照迷信，河有河神，山有山神，天上有玉皇，地上有土地，海里有龙王，真是烧不完的纸香，念不完的经文，陈规旧习重重叠叠地束缚着人们的思想。但是，一声跃进，人们骤然摆脱了这种种束缚，鬼神也就立即退位。
    过去，许多人迷信的是鬼、是神、是天，“天”主宰着一切。然而，今天人们相信的却是人，是人民自己的劳动和创造，真正地“人定胜天”。
    陕西安康县的农民编了一首快板唱道：
    天上没有玉皇，地上没有龙王；
    我就是玉皇，我就是龙王。
    喝令三山五岭开道：
    我来了。
    这不仅是反映了劳动人民改造自然的英雄气概，而且表明了：人们在劳动的实践中懂得，人是自然的主宰，人民是能够自己解放自己的，而劳动和创造就是求得解放的可靠的力量。迷信一经破除，解放出来的不仅是人们的思想，无比的智慧和雄厚的生产力也随着解放出来。
    说起迷信来，当然，如今烧香念经，求神拜佛，整天祈祷上帝的人，终究是极少数了。但是，封建迷信遗留下来的旧风俗、老皇历，还束缚着人们的思想。我们不是也还听见有人指手画脚地高谈这不合乎规矩、那不合乎传统等等因循老套的论调吗？这些人不敢想，也不敢做，饱食终日只能照老规矩行事，听天由命，生怕违背那个“旧”字。按照这些人的老皇历，我们不必苦干、实干地闹革命，只需多烧香、多磕头，这社会主义就从天而降了。
    然而，历史总是按照客观发展规律前进的，任何传统和习惯的势力都不能阻拦。破除迷信，思想解放，不再信神信鬼，而要相信人的力量。这是一场辩证唯物主义和唯心主义、先进思想和落后保守思想之间的斗争。“信鬼神”自然不对；“敬鬼神而远之”，更是一种消极妥协的态度。我们提倡的是：科学的头脑，敢想、敢说、敢做的风格，从种种迷信中彻底解放出来。
