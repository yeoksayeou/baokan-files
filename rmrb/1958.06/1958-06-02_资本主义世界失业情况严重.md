Xinhua News Agency, Geneva Dispatch: The “International Labour Organization,” which began its meeting in Geneva on May 30th, stated in a report that in 1957-1958, the number of unemployed in the capitalist world is constantly growing.

This specialized agency of the United Nations said in the report that in the first quarter of this year, the number of unemployed in the United States and Canada has reached the highest record since the war. The number of unemployed in Australia, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden has also reached the highest record in the past five years, while Belgium and Denmark have reached the highest record in the past two years. The report pointed out that besides the United States, the unemployment situation in other countries is also very serious, which can be seen from the proportion of unemployed workers to the total number of workers: Denmark 17.1%, Puerto Rico 14.9%, Canada 10.2%, and Belgium 9.8%.

The report said that in Britain, although the proportion of unemployed people is only 2.1% on average, it is 7.6% in Northern Ireland and 6.7% in some parts of South Wales. Moreover, the number of unemployed workers in Britain has increased month by month this year, from 440,000 in January to 495,000 in April.

The report said that this increase in unemployment has caused concern in many countries, and many people are anxiously watching the development and impact of the economic recession in the United States. The report is worried that if the poverty, suffering, and frustration caused by severe and persistent unemployment develop, it will cause people to generally disillusion with the capitalist economic and social systems.

    资本主义世界失业情况严重
    据新华社日内瓦讯　5月30日开始在日内瓦举行会议的“国际劳工组织”在一份报告中说，在1957—1958年，资本主义世界的失业人数正在不断增长。
    这个联合国的专门机构在报告中说，今年第一季美国和加拿大的失业人数已经达到战后最高纪录，澳大利亚、英国、荷兰、挪威和瑞典的失业人数也达到了五年内的最高纪录，比利时和丹麦达到了两年来的最高纪录。报告指出，除了美国以外，其他一些国家失业情况也很严重，这可以从失业工人占全体工人的比重中看出来：丹麦17.1％，波多黎各14.9％，加拿大10.2％，比利时9.8％。
    报告说，在英国，虽然失业人数的比重平均只有2.1％，但是在北爱尔兰却是7.6％，在南威尔士一些地方是6.7％。而且英国失业工人今年逐月增加，从1月份的四十四万人增加到4月份的四十九万五千人。
    报告说，这种失业增加的情况已经引起许多国家的忧虑，许多人正在焦虑地注视着美国经济衰退的发展和影响。报告担心，如果严重而持久的失业所造成的人民的贫困、痛苦和颓丧发展下去，就会引起人们普遍对资本主义的经济制度和社会制度的幻想破灭。
