Following the criticism of the tendency to detach from reality and from the broad masses of Chinese psychologists during the Two Antis Campaign, the staff of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences changed their past method of grouping according to scientific systems. They re-established three research groups—educational psychology, labor psychology, and medical psychology—in line with the practical needs of China's leap forward in various fields.

After their establishment, each research group sent people to factories, mines, and educational and medical departments to understand the actual situation, and then formulated the research plans for each group. For example, the age characteristics of Chinese children are basic data urgently needed for education, childcare, and other work. In the past, no one in China had systematically studied this, and now they plan to organize national forces to conduct joint research. In medical psychology, they have selected one of the major medical problems that has not yet been solved—the effective prevention and treatment of neurasthenia—as an important research project within three years.

The institute's leap forward plan has already begun to be implemented. For example, the institute's factory has recently completed an attention allocation instrument. In the field of labor psychology, the institute has begun to conduct research on issues such as rationalizing labor production operations, reducing rejection rates, and preventing accidents. During the Two Antis Campaign, they cooperated with relevant units to complete a lecture on rationalizing labor operations in just over a month, and held a training course for industrial sectors. This is of great significance to the industrial sector in improving labor productivity.

　　研究实际生活中的心理问题
    在双反运动中，中国科学院心理研究所的工作人员批判了脱离实际和脱离中国心理学界广大群众的偏向以后，改变了过去按科学体系分组的办法，结合我国各方面跃进的实际需要重新成立了教育心理、劳动心理、医学心理三个研究组。
    每个研究组在成立以后，都曾派人到工厂、矿山和教育、医学等部门去了解实际情况，然后制订了各组的研究计划。例如，中国儿童年龄特征是教育、保育等工作所急需的基本资料，过去我国从没有人系统地研究过，现在他们准备组织全国力量共同进行研究。在医学心理方面，他们选择了医学上尚未解决的重大问题之一——神经衰弱的有效防治，作为三年内的重要研究项目。
    这个研究所的跃进计划已开始执行。例如，这个研究所的工厂最近已完成了一台注意力分配仪。在劳动心理方面这个研究所已就劳动生产操作合理化、降低废品率、防止事故等问题开展研究。他们在双反期间，以一个多月的时间，同有关单位合作完成了一本劳动操作合理化的讲义，并为产业部门举办了一个训练班。这对产业部门提高劳动生产率有着重要意义。
