Xinhua News Agency, June 24th – Among the personnel from Beijing municipal-level organizations and groups who participated in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, 77 people have received medals for constructing the Ming Tombs Reservoir, and more than 800 people have been commended by the brigades or teams in the labor army.

To date, more than 6,800 cadres from municipal-level organizations and groups have participated in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. Among them, approximately 4,000 people have worked for more than ten days. Leaders of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, as well as responsible cadres of their respective units, have mostly participated in voluntary labor.

After a period of vibrant construction site life, the cadres who participated in voluntary labor felt that they had "reaped a double harvest of labor and thought." Some said: "This is not only a good place to exercise the body, but also a good place to cure the 'three winds and five airs'."
