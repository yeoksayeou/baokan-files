    Performing Magic Should Not Promote Superstition
    Recently, when the Nanyang City Magic Acrobatic Troupe of Henan Province performed the programs "Head Exchange" and "One Person Divided into Three Sections" in Jianli County, Hubei Province, the actors boasted: "This is the highest level of Taoist magic in our troupe for decades. As long as the talisman water is sprayed, the human body can be cut off and the head can be reattached." After the performance, some elderly farmers and commune members with strong feudal and superstitious ideas actually believed it. Wu Xianjun, a farmer from Zoupu Township, whose neck was crooked, immediately went backstage to ask them to issue talisman water for treatment. Chen Jinzhi, a female commune member from Xianfeng Cooperative in Jiangwang Township, whose child was a cripple, also asked them to use magic to cure her child's limp. I hope that magic performances in the future will not promote superstitious ideas.

    表演魔术不要宣传迷信
    最近河南省南阳市魔术杂技团在湖北监利县演出“掉换人头”和“一人分成三截”节目时，演员吹嘘说：“这是我团几十年来最高的道法，只要将符水一喷，就能斩断人身，也能衔结人头。”表演后有些老年农民和封建迷信思想浓厚的社员就信以为真了。邹铺乡农民吴先均头颈不正，当即找到幕后求他们发符水诊治。姜王乡先丰社女社员陈金枝的小孩是个跛子，也要求使点法，把她的小孩的跛脚治好。希望今后表演魔术时不要宣传迷信思想。
