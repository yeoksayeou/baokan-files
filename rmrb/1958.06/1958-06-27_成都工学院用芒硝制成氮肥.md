Chengdu Institute of Technology, in implementing the policy of teaching serving production, has successfully experimented with using mirabilite to produce nitrogen fertilizer. This method of manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer is simple and easy to implement, suitable for adoption by the vast agricultural cooperatives.

The method of producing nitrogen fertilizer using mirabilite is as follows: Using mirabilite, coal, iron powder (iron powder as a catalyst, but also can use pyrite cinder or red soil, etc.), and limestone as raw materials, the materials are made into small spherical furnace charges. Then, under normal pressure and a temperature of 1000 degrees Celsius, air is passed through, allowing it to pass through the coal layer to obtain nitrogen gas. The obtained nitrogen gas enters a layer of furnace charge made of mirabilite, coal, and iron powder for nitriding. The nitriding product, sodium cyanide, is hydrolyzed to obtain ammonia gas and sodium carbonate two products. Ammonia can be used to manufacture nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonia water.

The characteristics of using mirabilite to produce nitrogen fertilizer are: the equipment is simple; in rural areas, easily found "pao sha" stone or refractory clay can be used to make the furnace, basically without the need for ironware; direct combustion using air eliminates the need to produce nitrogen gas, and it can be done in every cooperative. The manufactured raw materials are relatively common, such as mirabilite, which is produced in large quantities in Meishan, Sichuan, and is also available in Yunnan, the Northwest, and throughout the country. In the manufacturing process, the main raw material consumed is coal, and other raw materials can be recycled. In areas rich in mirabilite, soda ash can also be produced simultaneously. Calcium sulfide in the nitriding product can also be recovered and utilized. The entire production process and management are relatively simple and do not require any complex technology.

Currently, the school is in contact with industrial departments and preparing to conduct a medium-sized production experiment based on laboratory experiments, establishing a medium-sized production demonstration plant for production.

    成都工学院用芒硝制成氮肥
    成都工学院在贯彻教学为生产服务的方针中，试验成功了用芒硝制造氮肥，这种制造氮肥的方法简便易行，适合广大农业合作社采用。
    用芒硝制氮肥的方法是：利用芒硝、煤、铁粉（铁粉作触媒，也可用硫铁矿渣或土红等）、石灰石作原料，做成小球形的炉料，然后在常压及一千度温度的条件下通入空气，使其通过煤层得到氮气，得到的氮气进入用芒硝、煤、铁粉制成的炉料层进行氮化；氮化产物氰化钠，水解而得到氨气和碳酸钠两种产品，氨即可制造硫錏、硝錏、碳錏、氨水等氮肥。
    利用芒硝制氮肥的特点是：设备简便，在农村可用容易找到的泡沙石或耐火泥做炉，基本上不用铁器；直接用空气燃烧，不需要作氮气，可以在每个合作社做。制造的原料比较普遍，如芒硝在四川眉山等地产量很多，云南、西北及全国各地都有。在制造过程中，主要消耗原料是煤，其他原料还可循回再用。在盛产芒硝的地方，并可同时生产纯碱。氮化产物中的硫化钙也可设法收回利用。整个生产过程及管理都比较简便，不需要什么复杂技术。
    现在，该校正与工业部门联系，准备在实验室实验的基础上，进行中型生产实验，建立中型生产示范厂，进行生产。
