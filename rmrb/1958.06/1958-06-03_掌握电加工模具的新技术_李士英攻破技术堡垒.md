Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd: Worker-turned-technician Li Shiying, through a year of hard work, created seven types of electrical discharge machining tools, including the "Electrical Spark Drilling Machine," mastering the new technology of electrical discharge machining dies.

At the recent National Conference on Mechanization of Die Manufacturing, Li Shiying introduced the success of his research in electrical discharge machining technology, which surprised and impressed everyone. Unexpectedly, a task that engineers and university professors were researching without success was solved by a technician from a worker background with only an elementary school education.

The seven types of electrical discharge machining tools created by Li Shiying can perform a variety of processing operations such as drilling, cutting, grinding, abrasive cutting, welding, electrical engraving, and electrical spark surface strengthening, and the processed dies do not deform. In particular, the "Electrical Spark Drilling Machine" can drill holes of various shapes, ranging from as small as 25 square millimeters to as large as 10,000 square millimeters, in hard metals, and the processed hole walls are as bright and precise as those ground on a grinding machine. The emergence of this machine tool will have a far-reaching impact on the technical revolution of locksmiths who have long used files and hammers to chisel holes in hard alloys to make molds, and factories that rely on molds to process various instrument and electrical parts.

Li Shiying is a technician at the Shanghai Xincheng Electrical Appliance Factory, specializing in mold management. After their factory began producing various instruments and electrical appliances in batches, a large number of molds were needed in production. However, the molds meticulously filed by workers by hand often deformed into scrap during heat treatment, causing great anxiety. Therefore, he pondered day and night, wanting to solve this problem. At the beginning of last year, he saw a student reading a magazine on the bus that briefly mentioned the Soviet Union using "electrical machining" methods to manufacture molds, which could prevent mold deformation. He was extremely happy and, after many difficulties, finally found two books, "Electrical Spark Machining Method" and "Metal Electrical Machining Technology," in a small bookstore and immediately bought them. Based on the principles in the books and his twenty years of practical production experience, he used scrap materials to assemble an electrical spark perforation machine, but it was not working properly when used.

Li Shiying reported this matter to the factory leadership, and the leaders immediately encouraged him to continue his research, assigned people to assist him, provided him with a dedicated room, and supplied him with the necessary materials. With the support of the leadership, Li Shiying's confidence grew, and he looked for new materials everywhere. Finally, he found a Soviet book on electrical machining in the new book card at the International Bookstore and quickly bought it. However, he did not recognize even one Russian letter and could not find anyone who could translate scientific and technical books. Therefore, he resolved to translate it himself. He bought four Russian-Chinese dictionaries and used his spare time to translate it word by word. He first translated the table of contents, and then translated the sections he needed. When he started translating, he found that many sentences were unreadable and had to read the preceding and following sentences in reverse order. He asked others and was told that these were "inverted sentences," which he then understood. Soon, he translated the parts he needed and gained a lot of inspiration from it. However, there were still many problems, such as the iron core expansion problem and the electrolyte problem, which were not in the book, so he and his assistants came up with other solutions. With the strong support of the Party, after more than a year, at the beginning of this year, he finally created the "Electrical Spark Drilling Machine" and put it into production. At the same time, based on the principle of electrical spark machining, he also trial-produced an anodic mechanical tool grinding machine, which he used to sharpen knives, making the cutting edges smooth and fast. Later, he also made anodic abrasive cutting machines, electrical spark welding machines, electrical spark engraving machines, electrical spark surface strengthening machines and other electrical discharge machining tools.

    掌握电加工模具的新技术
    李士英攻破技术堡垒
    新华社上海2日电  工人出身的技师李士英苦干一年创造出“电火花钻孔机”等七种电加工机床，掌握了电加工模具这项新技术。
    在不久以前召开的全国模具制造机械化会议上，李士英介绍了自己研究电加工技术成功的情况，引起了大家的惊讶和重视。想不到这项工程师、大学教授正在研究还没有成功的课题却被一个只有小学文化程度的工人出身的技师解决了。
    李士英创制出来的七种电加工机床，能够担负钻孔、切削、磨削、磨割、焊接、电刻和电火花表面强化等多种工艺操作，加工出来的模具不变形。尤其是“电火花钻孔机床”，能够在硬质金属上钻出小到二十五平方公厘，大到一万平方公厘的各种各样形状的孔来，加工出来的孔壁像磨床上磨出来一样光亮和精确。这种机床的出现，对长期用锉刀、鎯头在硬合金上凿孔做模具的钳工，以及依靠模具来加工各种仪表、电器零件的工厂进行技术革命，将起深远的影响。
    李士英是上海新成电器厂的技师，专门管理模具。他们厂里在成批生产各种仪表电器以后，生产中要使用大量模具，但是由工人辛辛苦苦用手工锉出来的模具，在热处理时常常变形成了废品，使人十分发急，他于是日夜思索，想解决这个问题。去年年初，他在公共汽车上看到一个学生看的杂志上简单提到苏联用“电加工”的方法来制造模具，可以使模具不变形。他高兴极了，经过好多困难，好容易才在一家小书店发现了“电火花加工法”、“金属电加工工艺学”两种书，立即买了回来。他按照书上的原理，凭着他二十年的实际生产经验，用废料装成了一部电火花穿孔机，但是使用的时候却不灵。
    李士英把这件事向工厂领导上汇报，领导同志马上鼓励他继续钻研，并且派人给他做助手，专门给他一间房子，又供给他所需要的材料。李士英得到领导的支持，信心更足，又到处找新的资料，最后在国际书店的新书卡片里翻到了一本苏联出版的电加工方面的书，连忙买来。可是他连一个俄文字母也不识，请人翻译，也找不到能译科学技术书籍的人。于是他下定决心自己翻译。又去买了四本俄华词典，利用业余时间一个字一个字地翻译。他先把目录译出来，看那一节需要，再译那一节。开始译的时候，他觉得很多句子读不通，要把前面一句和后面一句颠倒过来读才行。他请教别人，别人告诉他这是“倒装句”，他才明白了。不久，他就把需要的部分译了出来，从中得到了不少启发。可是还有不少问题，比如铁心膨胀问题、电解液问题等等，书本上没有，他就和助手们另想办法。在党的大力支持下，经过一年多时间，在今年年初他终于把“电火花钻孔机”创造出来，投入生产。与此同时，他还根据电火花加工的原理，试制成阳极机械工具磨削机床，用它来磨刀，刀口光滑，磨得快。以后，他又制成了阳极磨割机、电火花接焊机、电火花电刻机、电火花表面强化机等电加工机床。
