    Soviet agricultural product procurement and purchasing
    The Soviet agricultural product procurement system adopted different methods during different periods of Soviet socialist transformation and construction. In the early days of the Soviet regime, methods such as the surplus grain appropriation system and the grain tax were adopted. After agricultural collectivization, collective farms were changed to sell agricultural products to the state as an obligatory task, while also paying machine tractor stations with in-kind remuneration.
    This obligatory sales system required farms to sell agricultural products to the state at lower state-prescribed procurement prices, based on state-stipulated quotas (quotas calculated according to agricultural land area). In addition to obligatory sales, the state also purchased agricultural products from farms at purchasing prices higher than procurement prices.
    After the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in September 1953, the Soviet Union greatly increased the prices for procuring and purchasing agricultural products, which played a significant role in stimulating the production enthusiasm of collective farmers.

    苏联农产品的征购和采购
    苏联的农产品采购制度，在苏联社会主义改造和建设的不同时期采取了不同的方式。在苏维埃政权初期，采取过余粮收集制和粮食税等方式。在农业集体化以后，改由集体农庄向国家义务交售农产品，同时集体农庄还付给机器拖拉机站以实物报酬。
    这种义务交售制是农庄根据国家规定的定额（定额按农业用地面积计算），以国家规定的较低的征购价格，把农产品卖给国家。除义务交售外，国家还按高于征购价格的采购价格，向农庄购买农产品。
    在苏共中央1953年9月全会以后，苏联大大提高了征购和采购农产品的价格，这对于刺激集体农民生产积极性起了很大的作用。
