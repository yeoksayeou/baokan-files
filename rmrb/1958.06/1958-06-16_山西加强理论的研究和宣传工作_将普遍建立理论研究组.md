Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 15th: The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to universally establish theoretical research groups in organs, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, universities, colleges, and troops above the county level throughout the province, and to establish current affairs political theory lecture stations in rural townships and towns, urban streets, factories, mines, enterprises, organizations, schools, and troops.

The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the heads of theoretical education sections of various local and municipal Party committees from the 9th to the 10th of June. In order to vigorously carry out Marxist-Leninist theoretical research and propaganda work, strengthen the guiding role of theory in practical work, criticize bourgeois ideology and bourgeois academic viewpoints, criticize modern revisionism, and strengthen guidance for cadres' theoretical study, the meeting, after research, made the above decision.

The establishment of theoretical research groups is aimed at closely combining cadres engaged in practical work with theoretical workers. Therefore, it has been determined that they should be composed of Party committee secretaries at all levels, heads of various departments, and theoretical workers or those who are interested in theoretical research. Each group will generally consist of five to seven people. The tasks of the theoretical research groups are to guide cadres' theoretical study, study theoretical issues raised in practical work, and regularly write articles for Party theoretical publications and Party newspapers. Local and municipal Party committees should also systematically delve into or organize several core groups in order to focus on creating experience and promoting the research work of general groups.

The current affairs political theory lecture stations established in rural townships and towns, urban streets, factories, mines, enterprises, organizations, schools, and troops mainly aim to regularly publicize major domestic and international events, the Party's lines and policies, and conduct popular theoretical propaganda to the broad masses. To enable the broad masses to understand what socialism is and how to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, so it can become a guide for the practical actions of the broad masses.

    山西加强理论的研究和宣传工作
    将普遍建立理论研究组
    新华社太原15日电　中共山西省委宣传部决定在全省县级以上的机关、团体、厂矿企业、大专学校和部队中，普遍建立理论研究小组，在农村的乡、镇，城市的街道以及厂矿企业、机关团体、学校和部队中建立时事政治理论讲演站。
    中共山西省委宣传部9日到10日召开了各地委、市委理论教育科长会议。为了大力开展马克思列宁主义理论研究和宣传工作，加强理论对实际工作的指导作用，批判资产阶级思想和资产阶级学术观点，批判现代修正主义，加强对干部理论学习的指导，会议经过研究，作出了上述决定。
    建立理论研究小组是为了使做实际工作的干部和理论工作者紧密结合起来，因此确定由各级党委书记、各部门负责人和理论工作者或爱好理论研究的人组成。每个小组一般五到七人。理论研究小组的任务是指导干部的理论学习，研究实际工作中提出的带有理论性的问题，定期为党的理论刊物和党报撰写稿件。各地委、市委还要有计划地深入或组织几个核心小组，以便有重点地创造经验，推动一般小组的研究工作。
    在农村的乡镇、城市的街道以及厂矿企业、机关团体、学校和部队中建立的时事政治理论讲演站，主要是定时地向广大群众宣传国内外大事、党的路线、政策和通俗地进行理论宣传。使广大群众都懂得什么是社会主义，以及如何多快好省地建设社会主义等问题，成为广大群众实际行动的指南。
