Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 4th: While France's political future is undergoing a severe test, its fiscal and economic situation is also rapidly deteriorating.

It is reported that France borrowed a huge foreign debt of 655 million US dollars at the beginning of this year, but in less than half a year, its treasury is almost empty again.

In May, France's deficit in the West European "Payments Union" reached 76.62 million US dollars, the most serious deficit since the 20% de facto devaluation of the French franc was implemented last August.

The colonial war in Algeria costs an average of 5 million US dollars per day.

The newly appointed Minister of Finance and Economy, Pinay, said at a press conference on the 3rd that in order to continue this colonial war, the government will further extort the people and levy more exorbitant taxes.

    殖民战争耗尽国库
    法国财政经济加速恶化
    新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：正当法国的政治前途经历着严重考验的同时，法国的财政经济状况也正在加速恶化。
    有消息说，法国在今年年初才借了六亿五千五百万美元的巨额外债，但是在不到半年的时间内，它的国库几乎又空了。
    5月份法国在西欧“支付同盟”中的赤字达到七千六百六十二万美元，是从去年8月采取法郎实际贬值20％的措施以来最严重的赤字。
    阿尔及利亚的殖民战争每天平均要消耗五百万美元的巨款。
    新上任的财政和经济部长比内3日在记者招待会上说，为了继续进行这场殖民战争，政府将进一步向人民勒索，征收更多的苛捐杂税。
