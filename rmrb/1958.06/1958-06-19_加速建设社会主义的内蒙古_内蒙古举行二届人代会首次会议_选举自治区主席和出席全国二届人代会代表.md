Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 18th: The first session of the Second People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was held in Hohhot from the 7th to the 16th. The meeting heard the government work report by Autonomous Region Chairman Ulanhu, entitled "Resolutely Implement the General Line of Socialist Construction, and Strive to Accelerate the Socialist Construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region!", as well as other reports; after discussion, it adopted six resolutions on government work, the Autonomous Region's Five-Year Plan for Socialist Construction, the Twelve-Year Plan for Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Development, court work, and the Autonomous Region's finances; by secret ballot, it elected Ulanhu (Mongolian) as Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Su Qianyi (Han), Yang Zhilin (Han), Kui Bi (Mongolian), Hafunga (Mongolian), Wang Zaitian (Mongolian), Sun Lanfeng (Han), Wang Yilun (Han), and Dali Zaya (Mongolian) as Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region, and Wang Zaitian (Mongolian), Li Jidong, Zhao Bin, Zhang Jiafu, Kui Bi (Mongolian), Ulanhu (Mongolian), Tan Zhenxiong, Su Qianyi, Liu Xiumei (female), Huhlete (Mongolian), Temur Ba Gen (Mongolian), Ulan (female, Mongolian), Jieergele (Mongolian), Gala Zang (Mongolian), Zhou Beifeng, and Dali Zaya (Mongolian) as delegates from the Autonomous Region to the Second National People's Congress, and Temur Ba Gen (Mongolian) as President of the Autonomous Region's Higher People's Court.

This meeting was a great leap forward report meeting for the more than nine million people of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and it was also a mobilization meeting to further liberate thinking, eliminate feelings of inferiority, and deeply implement the Party's general line of socialist construction.

In the government work report made at the meeting, Autonomous Region Chairman Ulanhu summarized the work of the Autonomous Region over the past year and more, explaining the extremely profound changes that have taken place in all aspects in the past year and more, and using a large number of facts to illustrate the new situation of great ideological liberation, great national unity, and great leap forward in production that has emerged in the region. When talking about accepting the lessons of the "saddle shape," Ulanhu once again criticized the "Inner Mongolia is backward" theory. He said that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is extremely rich in mineral and forest resources, which are superior conditions for developing various production and construction projects. More importantly, there are more than nine million liberated, awakened, united, and organized people of all nationalities who have created and are creating amazing miracles in socialist construction. For example, the first-class product rate of Hohhot Woolen Textile Factory No. 1 is approaching the level of the most advanced Shanghai China Woolen Textile Factory in the country, and the quality of cream produced by Hailar Dairy Factory has reached the advanced level in the world. Baotou Automobile Repair Factory, which has always been considered to have a low technical level, has successfully trial-produced tractors. There is no doubt that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the strong help of fraternal provinces and regions, as long as we actively implement the general line, the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will soon change. Ulanhu said that the facts are very clear, the thinking methods of skeptics and onlookers are metaphysical, seeing only things but not people, seeing only the backward aspects of Inner Mongolia's economy and culture, and not seeing or rarely seeing the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses. We must widely criticize this kind of thinking, liberate their thinking from the shackles of right-leaning conservatism and empiricism and dogmatism, eliminate feelings of inferiority, invigorate the spirit, and advance bravely together with the people of the entire region.

When the representatives discussed Ulanhu's report and other reports, their speeches were extremely enthusiastic. Many representatives excitedly talked about the significant achievements made by the people of the Autonomous Region in the Great Leap Forward. For example, the amount of water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring can expand the irrigated farmland and feed base by more than 11 million mu, plus the original paddy fields, the agricultural population has an average of more than three mu of paddy fields per person. The sown area of high-yield crops in the region has increased by more than one and a half times compared with last year, and the amount of fertilizer application has increased by more than two times compared with last year. The habit of extensive planting and low harvesting is rapidly changing. The broad masses of herdsmen have overcome severe droughts and snow disasters, and have achieved good results in lambing and lamb protection work. The flowers of local industry are also blooming all over the region. As of the end of May, nearly 4,000 new factories and mines have been built in the region. The timber production of the Greater Khingan Range forest industry in the first quarter of this year increased by nearly one time compared with the same period last year, and so on.

Many representatives mentioned that all these amazing achievements were achieved under the guidance of the Party's general line of socialist construction. Their common conclusion is that in order to better implement the general line of socialist construction and plant the red flag in all aspects, it is necessary to mobilize the masses more widely and deeply, break down superstitions, and establish a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to create. In the Autonomous Region, it is very important to continuously strengthen the unity of all nationalities. It is necessary to continue to criticize Han chauvinism and local nationalism, especially local nationalism, so that the relations between all nationalities can be firmly established on the common foundation of accelerating the socialist construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    加速建设社会主义的内蒙古
    内蒙古举行二届人代会首次会议
    选举自治区主席和出席全国二届人代会代表
    新华社呼和浩特18日电　内蒙古自治区第二届人民代表大会第一次会议7日到16日在呼和浩特举行。这次会议听了自治区主席乌兰夫题为“坚决执行社会主义建设总路线，为加速建设社会主义的内蒙古自治区而奋斗！”的政府工作报告，以及其他报告；经过讨论，通过了关于政府工作、自治区社会主义建设五年规划、农牧业发展十二年规划、法院工作、自治区财政等六项决议；以无记名投票方式选举乌兰夫（蒙）为内蒙古自治区主席，苏谦益（汉）、杨植霖（汉）、奎璧（蒙）、哈丰阿（蒙）、王再天（蒙）、孙兰峰（汉）、王逸伦（汉）、达理扎雅（蒙）为自治区副主席，王再天（蒙）、李继侗、赵斌、张稼夫、奎璧（蒙）、乌兰夫（蒙）、谭振雄、苏谦益、刘秀梅（女）、胡和勒泰（蒙）、特木尔巴根（蒙）、乌兰（女、蒙）、杰尔格勒（蒙）、噶喇藏（蒙）、周北峰、达理扎雅（蒙）为自治区出席全国第二届人民代表大会代表，特木尔巴根（蒙）为自治区高级人民法院院长。
    这次会议是内蒙古自治区九百多万各族人民的大跃进汇报大会，也是进一步解放思想，打掉自卑感，深入地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的动员大会。
    自治区主席乌兰夫在会上所作的政府工作报告，总结了自治区一年多来的工作，说明在过去一年多中各方面所经历的极其深刻的变化，用大量事实阐明全区出现的思想大解放、民族大团结、生产大跃进的新形势。乌兰夫在谈到接受马鞍形的教训时，又一次批判了“内蒙古落后论”。他说，内蒙古自治区的矿产和森林等资源极为丰富，这是发展各项生产建设的优越条件。更重要的是有解放了的、觉悟了的、团结和组织起来的九百多万各族人民，在社会主义建设中，他们创造了和正在创造着惊人的奇迹。例如呼和浩特市毛织一厂的一等品率已接近全国最先进的上海中国毛织厂的水平，海拉尔乳品厂的奶油质量已经达到世界的先进水平。一向被认为技术水平不高的包头汽车修配厂已经试制成功了拖拉机。毫无疑问，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在各兄弟省区的大力帮助下，只要我们积极贯彻执行总路线，内蒙古自治区的面貌必将很快改观。乌兰夫说，事实很明显，怀疑派和观潮派的思想方法是形而上学的，是只见物不见人，只看到内蒙古经济和文化落后的方面，看不到或很少看到群众的革命性和创造性。必须广泛地批判这种思想，使他们的思想从右倾保守和经验主义、教条主义的束缚下解放出来，打掉自卑感，振奋精神，和全区人民一道，勇敢前进。
    代表们在讨论乌兰夫的报告和其他报告时，发言极为热烈。许多代表兴奋地谈到了自治区人民在大跃进中取得的重大成就。例如在去冬今春期间兴修的水利工程量，可扩大灌溉农田和饲料基地一千一百多万亩，加上原有的水田，农业人口平均每人拥有水田三亩多。全区高产作物的播种面积比去年增加一倍半多，施肥数量比去年提高二倍以上，广种薄收的习惯正在迅速改变。广大牧民战胜了严重的干旱和风雪灾害，在接羔保羔工作上取得了良好的成绩。地方工业之花也在全区遍地开放。到5月底止，全区新建厂矿已近四千个。大兴安岭森林工业的木材生产量，今年第一季度比去年同期增加将近一倍等等。
    许多代表都谈到，所有这些惊人的成就，都是在党的社会主义建设总路线指引下取得的。他们的共同结论是：要想更好地贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，把红旗插到一切方面去，必须更加广泛深入地发动群众，破除迷信，树立起敢想、敢说、敢做、敢于创造的共产主义风格。在自治区，不断加强各民族的团结是很重要的，应当继续批判大汉族主义和地方民族主义，特别是地方民族主义，使各民族的关系巩固地建立在为加速内蒙古自治区社会主义建设的共同基础之上。
