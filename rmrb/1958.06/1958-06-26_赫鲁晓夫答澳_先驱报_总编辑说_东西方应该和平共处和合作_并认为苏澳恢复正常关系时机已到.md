Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 24th: TASS reports that the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said in response to questions from Australian "Herald" Editor-in-Chief Walters, that the time has come for the complete restoration of diplomatic relations between Australia and the Soviet Union. He said that if the Australian government hopes for the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Soviet Union is willing to do so.

Khrushchev recalled that as early as the autumn of 1956, the Australian and Soviet ambassadors to Washington reached an agreement on the content of a joint communique proposed by Australia regarding the resumption of activities of the diplomatic representative offices of the two countries, but until now, the Australian government has not indicated that it is prepared to publish this communique. Khrushchev emphasized that this issue depends on Australia.

Khrushchev said that if our relations with Australia can be normalized, trade between the Soviet Union and Australia will undoubtedly greatly develop.

Khrushchev expounded the Soviet Union's position on the nature of international relations between socialist and capitalist countries: First, any political form and social structure of each country should be decided by the people of these countries themselves; second, no country and no external force should force the people of other countries to accept their own way of life, political and social structure; third, the emergence of socialist systems is lawful, just as the emergence of capitalist countries was lawful in the past; and finally, in order to prevent humanity from war, socialist and capitalist countries should implement the principles of peaceful coexistence and cooperation in their mutual relations.

Khrushchev said that we believe that a meeting of leaders of various countries, with sincerity on both sides, can find ways to solve pressing international problems. However, Western countries have not yet shown a genuine desire to accelerate the convening of a high-level meeting. He pointed out that if even a few of the most pressing issues are resolved at the meeting, it will be a good foundation for further actions to ease international tensions, and will trigger a chain reaction of general normalization of international relations.

Speaking about the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, Khrushchev pointed out that it is not yet clear whether the United States and Britain will agree to a cessation of testing. The Soviet head of government said that we still hope that they will change their current position under the pressure of the people of all countries.

Khrushchev said that the reunification of Germany currently depends on the corresponding actions of the German people themselves. The Germans themselves should first resolve the issue of German reunification on the basis of mutual agreement between the existing two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

In response to the question of inviting the People's Republic of China to participate in high-level talks, Khrushchev said that the People's Republic of China has the most beneficial influence on the development of the international situation not only in the Far East, but also in the world. Khrushchev said that the main thing is not whether to invite the People's Republic of China to participate in high-level meetings, but whether the legitimate interests of such a large country will be taken into account. Any decision that undermines the interests of the People's Republic of China is untenable.

Regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Antarctic system issue, the Soviet head of government said: Antarctica has international significance because this area and the adjacent ocean are of great value to the economies of many countries (including the Soviet Union). Therefore, according to international practice, when discussing the system of a region of international significance, all relevant countries should be involved. The Soviet government believes that this international practice should also be followed when resolving the Antarctic system issue.

    赫鲁晓夫答澳“先驱报”总编辑说
    东西方应该和平共处和合作
    并认为苏澳恢复正常关系时机已到
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在回答澳大利亚“先驱报”总编辑华特斯的问题时说，完全恢复澳大利亚同苏联之间的外交关系的时候已经来到了。他说，如果澳大利亚政府希望两国外交关系的正常化，苏联愿意这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫回顾说，还在1956年秋天，澳大利亚和苏联驻华盛顿大使就对澳大利亚所建议的关于恢复两国外交代表机构活动的联合公报内容达成协议，可是直到现在，澳大利亚政府尚未表示它准备发表这个公报。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，这个问题取决于澳大利亚。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果我们同澳大利亚的关系能够正常化，苏联同澳大利亚之间的贸易无疑会得到很大的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫就社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间国际关系的性质问题阐述了苏联的立场：第一，每个国家的任何政治形式和社会结构应当由这些国家的人民自己来决定；第二，任何国家和任何外来力量都不应当强使别国人民接受自己的生活方式、政治和社会结构；第三，社会主义制度的国家的出现是合乎规律的，正像当年资本主义国家的出现是合乎规律的一样；最后，为了使人类避免战争，社会主义国家和资本主义国家在相互关系中应当贯彻和平共处和合作原则。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们相信，各国领导人的会议在双方具有诚意的情况下可以找到解决迫切国际问题的途径。但是西方国家直到现在仍未表现出加速召开高级会议的真正愿望。他指出，如果在会议上将解决那怕是最迫切问题中的几个问题，那么这也会成为缓和国际紧张局势的进一步行动的良好基础，也会引起国际关系普遍正常化的连锁反应。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到停止试验核武器时指出，目前还看不出美国和英国会同意停止试验。苏联政府首脑说，我们仍然希望，他们能够在各国人民的压力下改变他们现在的立场。
  赫鲁晓夫说，恢复德国统一目前取决于德国人民本身的相应行动。德国人自己应当在现存两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国互相达成协议的基础上首先解决恢复德国统一的问题。
    在回答邀请中华人民共和国参加高级会谈的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，中华人民共和国不仅对远东地区，而且对全世界国际局势的发展起着最良好的影响。赫鲁晓夫说，主要的不在于邀请不邀请中华人民共和国参加高级会议，而在于是否将考虑到这样一个大国的合法利益。任何破坏中华人民共和国利益的决定都是站不住脚的。
    在谈到苏联对南极制度问题的态度时，苏联政府首脑说：南极具有国际意义，因为这块地方和同它相毗连的海洋对于很多国家（其中也包括苏联）的经济，具有很大的价值。因此根据国际惯例，在讨论某个具有国际意义地区的制度时，应当吸收全体有关的国家参加。苏联政府认为，在解决南极制度的问题时也应当遵守这个国际惯例。
