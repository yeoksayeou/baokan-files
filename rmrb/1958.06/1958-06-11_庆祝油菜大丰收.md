    The rapeseed harvest is the first piece of good news in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. Preliminary estimates indicate that the national rapeseed production will increase by about 60% compared to last year, with a total output more than double that of 1949, exceeding the average annual growth rate since liberation by more than twenty-five times. The great leap forward in rapeseed production is the result of the broad masses of farmers, under the leadership of the Party, correctly implementing the Party's general line for building socialism. The bumper rapeseed harvest not only begins to change the backward state of China's oilseed crops and has significant implications for improving the people's edible oil levels, but more importantly, it powerfully shatters the right-leaning conservative ideas of some people who believe that rapeseed production is unstable and that the growth rate can only be slow, strengthening confidence for further increasing rapeseed production in the future. Facts have proven that the Party Central Committee's policy of advancing grain, cotton, and oil together is completely correct and completely achievable.
    This year's rapeseed production has seen the emergence of many large-area high-yield banners. The average yield per unit area in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, and Songzi County, Hubei Province, can reach about 250 jin, 180 jin, and 150 jin respectively. It is estimated that there are at least more than ten million mu of high-yield areas exceeding 100 jin nationwide. There are also many breakthroughs in historical high-yield records this year. The three mu of high-yield fields in the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, yielded an average of 806 jin of rapeseed per mu. The 23 mu of high-yield fields in the Deyang County Farm in Sichuan Province can yield 600 jin of rapeseed per mu. The Xiang, E, and Gan regions, which were once regarded as low-yield areas, have seen the fastest leap forward and the largest increase this year, with both unit area yield and total output generally increasing by more than double. Rapeseed itself has high-yield characteristics such as many branches, many flowers, dense pods, and many seeds, with enormous potential for increased production. A rapeseed plant cultivated in Zhong County, Sichuan Province, has more than 700 branches and more than 49,000 pods, capable of producing more than six jin of rapeseed. When developing rapeseed crops, all localities should pay attention to discovering and studying particularly well-growing high-yield single plants, harvesting and threshing them separately, and cultivating them, which is of great significance for improving rapeseed varieties and increasing rapeseed production. In the past, some areas had low yields, mainly because rapeseed was not cultivated as a single-season crop. Cultivation was extensive, with no fertilizer applied, no weeding, and harvest only if available, otherwise discarded, resulting in the failure of rapeseed production to increase rapidly. Facts have proven that as long as the Party committee strengthens leadership, applies fertilizer, and manages carefully, the face of low-yield rapeseed areas can be rapidly changed.
    Some may ask: Is this year's rapeseed harvest due to particularly favorable natural conditions last winter and this spring? The fact is not so. During the rapeseed sowing season last year, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River suffered from prolonged drought, and during the rapeseed growing period, there were frequent cold waves. In many areas such as East China and Southwest China, pests and diseases were also more serious than in previous years. Natural conditions were not better than in previous years. It was only because Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over oilseed production and fully mobilized the masses' enthusiasm for oilseed production that they overcame natural disasters and won the harvest. Jiangxi Province is the best example: After the rectification movement and the rural great debate, the province clarified the policy of an all-round leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil. The provincial Party committee put forward the slogan "Whip the horse and leap forward in all directions...", and promptly revised the original agricultural production policy, which focused on increasing grain and cotton production, to a policy of "all-round development of grain, cotton, and oil," making specific plans and arrangements for rapeseed production, and putting forward leap forward targets and specific measures. Therefore, rapeseed production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This proves that the rapeseed bumper harvest this year is not due to particularly favorable natural conditions compared to previous years, but to the strengthening of leadership over oilseed production by Party committees in various localities. Many district Party secretaries personally took command, set up experimental fields, organized visits and learning, conducted mutual evaluations, and implemented methods such as "three guarantees," striving for high yields everywhere and encouraging everyone to strive for the top. In terms of technical measures, they particularly focused on promoting improved varieties, timely and careful sowing, increasing base fertilizer application, seedling transplanting, rational close planting, ditching and draining waterlogging, preventing cold and frost, applying multiple top dressings, and heavily applying flower fertilizer. Many areas organized great debates on drought resistance and early sowing to increase production, effectively reversing the passive waiting mentality of some people and establishing the masses' confidence in increasing production. In the face of drought, they not only overfulfilled the rapeseed sowing task, but also advanced the sowing period by ten to fifteen days compared to the past.
    It should be pointed out that although various localities have achieved bumper harvests this year, the yield per unit area is still not high, and the potential for increased production is still enormous. There is still great potential for planting rapeseed in winter fallow fields in the southern production areas. In order to further implement the Central Committee's policy of advancing grain, cotton, and oil together, and to achieve the agricultural development program's rapeseed production targets ahead of schedule, in accordance with the spirit of seizing the present to prepare for the future and turning passivity into initiative, Party committees at all levels in rapeseed production areas should seize the time to summarize experiences after the rapeseed harvest, formulate leap forward targets for next year and specific measures to ensure the realization of these targets, and earnestly do all the preparatory work, advance victoriously, and strive for an even greater bumper rapeseed harvest in 1959.

### 庆祝油菜大丰收

    庆祝油菜大丰收
    油菜丰收是今年农业生产大跃进中第一个捷报。初步估计全国油菜将比去年增产60％左右，总产量相当于1949年二倍以上，超过解放以来历年平均增长速度的二十五倍。油菜生产的大跃进，是广大农民在党的领导下，正确贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线的结果。油菜大丰收不仅开始改变我国油料作物落后的现象，在提高人民食油水平上有重大意义，更重要的是有力地打破了一些人认为油菜生产不稳定、增长速度只能慢慢来的右倾保守思想，为今后进一步提高油菜生产增强了信心。事实证明党中央提出的粮、棉、油一起跃进的方针是完全正确的，也是完全可以实现的。
    在今年油菜生产上涌现了很多大面积丰产旗帜，江苏省兴化县、陕西省南郑县、湖北省松滋县等的全县平均单位面积产量，可分别达到二百五十斤、一百八十斤和一百五十斤左右。一百斤以上的大面积丰产区，全国估计最少达一千多万亩以上。今年突破历史上高额丰产纪录的也特别多，湖北省应城县先锋农业社三亩丰产田，平均每亩产菜籽八百零六斤。四川省德阳县农场二十三亩丰产田，每亩可收菜籽六百斤。过去一向被视为低产的湘、鄂、赣地区，今年跃进最快，增产最多，不论单位面积产量或总产量，一般均增产一倍以上。油菜本身具备着分枝多、开花多、结荚密、子粒多等丰产性状，有着巨大的增产潜力。四川省忠县培植的一棵油菜就有七百多分枝，四万九千多角果，可产六斤多菜籽。各地在发展油菜作物时，注意发现和研究生长特别良好的高产单株，单收单打，加以培育，对改良油菜品种，提高油菜产量有重要的意义。过去有些地区产量低，主要原因是没有将油菜作为一季作物来栽培，耕作粗放，不施肥、不锄草，有则收无则丢，以致使油菜生产不能迅速地提高。事实证明，只要党委加强领导，加工施肥，精心管理，油菜低产区的面貌是可以迅速改观的。
    有人要问：今年油菜丰收，是不是因为去冬今春自然条件特别优越呢？事实并不是这样。去年油菜播种季节，长江中游受着长期干旱，油菜生长期间，又遭寒流频袭；在华东、西南等很多地区病虫害也比往年严重；自然条件并不比往年好，只是由于各级党委加强了对油料生产的领导，充分发挥了群众对油料生产的积极性，才战胜了自然灾害，赢得了丰收。江西省就是一个最好的例子：该省经过整风运动及农村大辩论，明确了粮、棉、油全面跃进的方针后，省委提出“快马加鞭，全面跃进……”口号，及时将原来以增产粮棉为主的农业生产方针修改为“粮棉油全面发展”的方针，将油菜生产作了具体规划和安排，并提出了跃进指标和具体措施，因此，使油菜生产获得了空前的丰收。由此证明取得今年油菜丰收，并不是自然条件比往年特别优厚，而是由于各地党委加强了油料生产的领导。不少地区党委书记亲自挂帅，大搞试验田，组织参观学习，互相评比，贯彻三包等办法，处处搞丰产，人人争上游。在技术措施上，特别抓紧了推广良种、适时细播、增施底肥、育苗移栽、合理密植、开沟排渍、抗寒防冻、多次追肥、重施花肥。不少地区组织抗旱早播增产大辩论，有效扭转了一些人的消极等待情绪，树立了群众增产信心，在干旱情况下，不仅超额完成了油菜播种任务，播种期还比以往提前十到十五天。
    应当指出，今年各地虽然获得丰收，但是单位面积产量还不算高，增产潜力仍十分巨大，南方产区利用冬闲田种植油菜还大有可为。为了进一步贯彻中央提出的粮、棉、油一齐跃进的方针，提前实现农业发展纲要对油菜生产指标的要求，根据今年抓明年，变被动为主动的精神，油菜产区的各级党委应该在油菜收获后，抓紧时间总结经验，制订明年跃进指标及保证指标实现的具体措施，认真作好一切准备工作，乘胜前进，力争1959年油菜生产获得更大的丰收。
