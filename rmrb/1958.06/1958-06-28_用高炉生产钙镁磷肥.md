Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do!
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: Xu Yilun, a young technician at the Hangzhou Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, broke with superstition and successfully experimented with producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer using a blast furnace.
    Producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer with a blast furnace requires little investment and yields great results. Simply put the raw materials and coke into the furnace, and after being melted at high temperatures for more than ten minutes, the ore flows out like molten iron. After cooling, drying, and grinding, it becomes calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer. This fertilizer has a low cost, and the selling price is about half the price of ordinary synthetic ammonium nitrogen fertilizer.
    Xu Yilun, a 24-year-old Communist Party member, graduated from a secondary technical school and has only five years of work experience. After being transferred to the Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Factory as a technician last November, he began trial-producing calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer using olivine, apatite, dolomite and other minerals. According to documents, Poland has adopted the blast furnace method to produce calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer at a lower cost, but there is no technical data available. With the strong support of the Party organization, he constantly studied and experimented diligently. Finally, based on the blast furnace principle of steel plants, he designed a blast furnace and put olivine, apatite, coke and other materials into the blast furnace. When heated to 1400 degrees Celsius, the ore melted and eventually fused into an alkaline fertilizer.
    Currently, the Hangzhou Calcium-Magnesium Phosphate Fertilizer Factory has adopted the method created by Xu Yilun for small-scale production, with a daily output of about twelve tons of phosphate fertilizer.

    用高炉生产钙镁磷肥
    据新华社杭州27日电　杭州钙镁磷肥厂青年技术员徐一仑打破迷信，试验成功用高炉生产钙镁磷肥。
    用高炉生产钙镁磷肥，投资小、效果大，只要把原料和焦炭放入炉内，经过十多分钟高温熔化以后，矿石就像铁水一样奔流出来；然后经过冷却、干燥、磨细，就成为钙镁磷肥。这种肥料成本低，售价比一般合成铵氮肥要便宜一半左右。
    二十四岁的共产党员徐一仑是中等技术学校毕业的，只有五年工作经验。去年11月，他调到钙镁磷肥厂当技术员以后，便开始用橄榄石、磷灰石、白云石等矿石试制钙镁磷肥。根据文件记载，波兰已采用高炉法生产钙镁磷肥，成本较低，但是没有技术资料。在党组织的大力支持下，他不断刻苦钻研、试验。最后，他根据钢铁厂的高炉原理，设计了一只高炉，将橄榄石、磷灰石和焦炭等放入高炉内。当加温到摄氏一千四百度的时候，矿石熔解了，最后融合成为一种碱性肥料。
    目前，杭州钙镁磷肥厂已经采用徐一仑创造的办法，进行小批生产，每天能生产磷肥十二吨左右。
