　　Talking About Watermelons in Early Summer
　　Lü Xuyong
　　During the Five Dynasties period in China, a man named Hu Qiao brought back some melon seeds from the Uyghur region to plant. This melon came from the Western Regions, so it was called "watermelon." Later, it spread to various places and was widely cultivated and distributed. Now, the famous producing areas in China include Xinjiang, Shandong, Henan, Gansu and other provinces.
　　The profit from growing watermelons is considerable. Because its growing period is short, from sowing to harvesting it only takes three months; the yield per unit area is also high, with one mu (Chinese unit of area, approx. 1/6 acre) usually yielding four to five thousand catties (Chinese unit of weight, approx. 1.1 lbs), and sometimes more than ten thousand catties; and it is resistant to storage, thick-skinned watermelons can be stored in a cool and ventilated place for two or three months without spoiling.
　　Among the fruits that quench thirst and relieve heat in summer, watermelon is the most ideal. Its juice content is particularly high, accounting for about 90%. In addition, it contains about 7% sugar, 3% fat, minerals, vitamins and other substances. This sugar is a mixture of glucose and sucrose. White watermelon pulp contains more glucose and less sucrose; red watermelon pulp contains less glucose and more sucrose. Therefore, red-fleshed watermelons are generally sweeter than white-fleshed ones.
　　There are many kinds of watermelons, including Lama melon, Sanbai melon, Bin melon, Zhuyeqing melon, Zhusha Hong melon, White-skinned watermelon, and Maling melon.
　　For watermelons bought for immediate consumption, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the melon is ripe. A simple way to identify this is: hold the melon in your left hand and gently pat it with your right hand. If your left hand feels the vibration, it means the melon is ripe. Unripe melons, even if they are good varieties, do not taste good. In addition, a good watermelon also has three characteristics: (1) Appearance: the skin is shiny, the bottom is yellow, and the melon butt is deeply concave, but the surrounding area is very plump. (2) The melon can float when placed in water. (3) It makes a crisp sound when tapped with a finger, and feels elastic when pressed with the thumb.

　　初夏谈西瓜
　　吕绪庸
    我国五代时候，有个名叫胡峤的人，从回纥带回一种瓜子来种植。这种瓜来自西域，所以称为“西瓜”。以后，流传到各地大量栽培，分布很广。现在国内著名的产地有新疆、山东、河南、甘肃等省。
    种西瓜的收益很大。因为它的生长期短，从播种到收获不过三个月；单位面积产量又高，一亩地通常可收四、五千斤，多的在万斤以上；而且耐贮藏，皮厚的西瓜放在阴凉通风处，两、三个月也不会变坏。
    在夏天解渴消暑的水果中，西瓜是最理想的一种。它的汁水特别多，约占90％。另外约有7％的糖份，3％的脂肪、矿物质、维生素等物质。这糖份是葡萄糖和蔗糖的混合物。白色瓜瓤含的葡萄糖较多，蔗糖较少；红色瓜瓤所含葡萄糖较少，蔗糖较多。因此，一般红瓤的西瓜较白瓤甜。
    西瓜的种类很多，有喇嘛瓜、三白瓜、滨瓜、竹叶青、朱砂红、白皮西瓜、马铃瓜等。
    买来即时吃的西瓜，必须注意到瓜是否已经成熟。鉴别的简易方法是：把瓜放在左手，右手在上面轻拍，如下边的左手感到振动，即说明瓜已成熟。未成熟的瓜，即使是良种，也不好吃。此外，一个好的西瓜还有三种表现：（一）外观：皮面发亮，底面发黄，瓜屁股凹入得较深，但四周很肥大。（二）把瓜放入水中能够上浮。（三）用手指弹打时发松脆的声音，大拇指压着时感觉它是有弹性的。
