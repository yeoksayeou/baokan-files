Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 12th:  Nobusuke Kishi, the former Prime Minister of Japan, relying on the majority of seats held by the Liberal Democratic Party in the Diet, was elected Prime Minister today. After Kishi Nobusuke made every effort to adjust the factional struggles within the party in recent days, he finally formed a new cabinet tonight.

Fujiyama Aiichiro remains as Foreign Minister. Aichi Kiichi, the former Chief Cabinet Secretary, was reassigned as Minister of Justice. Other cabinet members include Finance Minister Sato Eisaku, Minister of International Trade and Industry Takasaki Tatsunosuke, and Ikeda Hayato, Miki Takeo, and Yamaguchi Kikujiro, who will serve as Ministers of State. Among all twenty cabinet members, nearly half are from the Kishi Nobusuke faction and the group of his younger brother Sato Eisaku.

Kishi Nobusuke and the Liberal Democratic Party also insisted on refusing to reasonably allocate various leadership positions in the House of Representatives to the Socialist Party. Relying on their majority vote, they monopolized all the positions of Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairmanships of the sixteen standing committees of the House of Representatives. Hoshino Jiro of the Kishi Nobusuke faction and Shiikuma Saburo of the Ishibashi Tanzan faction were elected as Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today pointing out that the reactionary nature of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet has become even more blatant after the general election. In the statement, the Socialist Party stated that it would wage a resolute struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke group both inside and outside the Diet in order to overthrow the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    岸信介组成日本新内阁
    日本社会党指出新阁反动性更加露骨
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本前首相岸信介依恃自由民主党在国会中把持的多数议席，今天当选为首相。岸信介并且在最近几天竭力调整了党内派系的斗争后，总算在今天晚上组成了新内阁。
    藤山爱一郎留任外务相，原任内阁官房长官爱知揆一改任法务相，内阁其他成员包括藏相佐藤荣作，通商产业相高碕达之助，池田勇人、三木武夫、山口喜久一郎等担任国务相。在全部二十名阁员中，岸信介派和他的弟弟佐藤荣作的集团的人士将近一半。
    岸信介和自由民主党并且坚持拒绝和社会党合理分配众议院的各种领导职务，依靠它们的多数票，全部霸占了众议院正副议长和众议院十六个常任委员长的职位。岸信介派的星野二郎和石桥湛山派的椎熊三郎被选为众议院正副议长。
    日本社会党今天发表声明指出，岸信介内阁的反动性在大选以后表现得更加露骨。社会党在声明中表示它要在国会内外同岸信介集团进行坚决的斗争，来打倒反动的岸信介内阁。
