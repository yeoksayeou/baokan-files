Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 14th. The example of youth worker Zhou Nanxing from Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, writing books and establishing theories once again proves the truth that theory comes from practice and technology comes from labor.

Zhou Nanxing is a fourth-grade inspector at the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory. He is only twenty-five years old, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a young worker who originally only had a junior high school first-grade education. However, he broke superstitions, dared to act, and over the past three years, he has concentrated his technical experience from on-site operations and written three scientific and technical theory books. Among them, the already published "Steel Spark On-Site Inspection Method," because this book starts from reality, refers to the principles of metallography, and summarizes specific experiences in the language of workers, has received attention from all sides. Engineer Shen Qian, head of the Wuxi Mechanical Engineering Society, said: "This book is very well written, integrating scientific theoretical knowledge and practical production experience into one, which is difficult for general engineering technicians to do." Wen Zongmeng, an inspector at the diesel engine factory, evaluated the book as: easy to understand, very practical. According to this book, the error in identifying steel components by workers in various machinery factories has been reduced from about 2% to about 0.2%. With this book as teaching material, the time for each factory to train apprentices in this area can also be shortened by more than half. His other two books have also been completed, titled: "Steel Element Spotting Method" and "Classification and Uses of Steel."

Zhou Nanxing entered a smelting plant as an apprentice at the age of fifteen and has now been working for ten years. His father and brothers are all railway workers. After Zhou Nanxing entered the machine tool factory in 1953 as a steel material inspector, he liked to study production. Every day he used an electric grinding wheel to rub steel, generate sparks, and inspect the components, always recording the different shapes of the sparks exploding from various steels, and analyzing and studying them. In his spare time, he often read theoretical books and periodicals on metallography, physics, and chemistry. After more than two years of day and night study, he studied the spark characteristics of more than sixty kinds of steel and explored the scientific laws of spark generation by steel elements. In 1955, he participated in the technical exchange group organized by workers in the forging and heat workshop. The operating experience and principles he introduced for identifying steel composition were praised by the master craftsmen. Later, after reading the book "Gao Yu Bao," he was inspired to write a book himself.

In the process of writing the book, he received the support of the Party and the masses, and with soaring energy, he overcame numerous difficulties. The first thing he encountered was discussions from all sides. In the face of this hurdle, he underwent a test of whether he dared to break through and whether his will to break through was firm. Some people were very surprised to hear that a young worker was going to write a book! Some people even satirized: "If you write a book, your nephew will be eight years old." Some technicians said: "A crude fellow can't write a book, let alone copy one." Zhou Nanxing was a little shaken by these words, but the Party supported him, and Party Branch Secretary Lu Huanjin encouraged him, saying: "Write boldly, as long as your purpose in writing the book is to spread experience, not for personal fame and gain, you can write it with confidence." Workshop director Xie Wenxun, master craftsman Zhou Dalai, Wang Xintian and others all constantly encouraged him, strengthening his confidence in writing the book. He not only mustered the courage to continue writing, but also boldly overturned the Japanese's erroneous conclusion about the spark characteristics of molybdenum elements based on practical experience.

The second hurdle he encountered was the cultural hurdle. In the process of writing the book, the biggest difficulty was the lack of mechanical drawing knowledge. He first asked a photographer to take pictures, but because the sparks exploded quickly, they were not captured. So, he joined the factory's amateur mechanical drawing study class, learning and drawing at the same time. One-third of the eighty-one illustrations in the book were successfully drawn only after drawing them dozens of times. In order to overcome the difficulty of lacking language knowledge, he also studied grammar, writing and reading to himself at the same time to see if the text was smooth.

The third hurdle was the time hurdle. He had to work during the day, so he could only squeeze time to write every night and on Sundays. Except for a few holidays, he did not stop writing for a day, regardless of severe cold or scorching heat. After spending more than a year, he finally finished writing the first book.

    理论来自实践　技术出于劳动
    青工周南兴大胆著书立说
    阐明了钢铁元素发生火花的科学规律
    新华社南京14日电　江苏省无锡市青年工人周南兴著书立说的事例，又一次证明了理论来自实践、技术出于劳动的真理。
    周南兴是无锡机床厂的四级检查工，今年才二十五岁，共青团员，是一个原来只有初中一年级文化程度的青年工人，但是他破除迷信，敢作敢为，三年多来集中了现场操作的技术经验，写成三本科学技术理论书。其中已经出版的是“钢铁火花现场检查法”，由于这本书从实际出发，参照金属学原理，用工人的语言总结了具体经验，受到各方面的重视。无锡市机械工程学会负责人沈潜工程师说：“这本书写得很好，把科学理论知识和实际生产经验融化为一，这是一般工程技术人员所难以做到的”。柴油机厂检查工温宗孟对这本书的评价是：容易懂，很实用。各机械厂工人根据该书鉴别钢铁成份的误差从2％左右减少到0.2％左右。有了这本书作教材，各厂培养这方面徒工的时间也可缩短一半以上。他的另外两本书也已脱稿，书名是：“钢铁元素点滴法”、“钢铁的分类和用途”。
    周南兴十五岁进冶炼厂当学徒，到现在已有十年工龄。他的父兄都是铁路工人。周南兴从1953年进机床厂当钢铁材料检查工后，在生产上喜欢钻研，每天用电动砂轮机摩擦钢材，发生火花，检验成份，总要记下各种钢材火花爆裂的不同形状，加以分析研究。工余时间，他常常阅读金属学、物理学、化学等理论书刊，经过两年多的日夜钻研，研究了六十多种钢材的火花特征，摸索到钢铁元素发生火花的科学规律。1955年他参加锻热车间工人组织的技术交流组，他介绍的鉴定钢铁成分的操作经验和原理，受到老师傅们的称赞。后来，他读到“高玉宝”一书，启发了自己写书的念头。
    他在写书的过程中，得到了党和群众支持，以冲天的干劲，突破了重重难关。他首先碰到的是来自各方面的议论。在这一关面前，他经受了敢不敢闯关和闯关的意志是否坚定的考验。有些人听说一个年轻工人要写书，非常惊讶！有的人还讽刺说：“你写成了书，你的外甥也有八岁了”。有的技术员说：“大老粗不用说写书，就是抄书也抄不好。”周南兴听了这些话有点动摇，但是党撑他的腰，党支书陆焕金鼓励他说：“大胆写，只要你写书的目的是为了传播经验，不是为了个人名利，你就理直气壮写下去。”工长谢文循、老师傅周大来、王莘田等人都不断的鼓励他，坚定了他写书的信心。他不但鼓足勇气写下去，而且大胆地根据实际经验推翻了日本关于钼元素火花特征的错误论断。
    他碰到的第二关是文化关。他在写书的过程中，最大困难是缺乏机械绘图知识，他先请照相馆摄影师来照，结果因为火花爆裂快，没有照成。于是，他自己就参加厂内业余机械画图学习班，一边学，一边画，全书八十一张插图，有三分之一是画了几十遍才画成功的。为了克服缺乏语文知识的困难，他又学习语法，一边写，一边念给自己听，看文字通顺不通顺。
    第三关是时间关。他白天要做工，因此只能在每天晚上、星期日挤时间写。除了几个节日外，不论严寒或酷暑，他没有停笔一天。花了一年多时间，他终于把第一本书写好了。（附图片）
