　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 4th. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, at its meeting on the 3rd, read out a congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. The telegram stated that the Central Committee of the French Communist Party warmly congratulates the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and sincerely congratulates the Congress on its major achievements. We were unable to send a delegation led by Comrade Duclos to participate in the Congress as planned. As you know, our Party is currently fully engaged in a major struggle to defend the Republic and the nation against the conspiracy orchestrated by De Gaulle. De Gaulle and other generals, as well as those keen on civil war, relying on the support of reactionary and colonial forces in France and Algeria, are attempting to overthrow the republican system and establish a fascist dictatorship. In the current struggle, our Party and the working class stand firmly at the forefront of the struggle to defend the Republic.

　　The telegram said that faced with the threat of fascism, our Party is working even harder to unite socialist workers and communist workers to overcome divisions in the ranks of the working class and strengthen the unity of the French people.

　　The will to defend the Republic is constantly strengthening. During the historic demonstration on May 28th this year, the residents of Paris showed their unwavering determination to crush the conspiracy of rebellion as they passed in front of the leaders of various republican parties and trade union organizations. At this critical juncture, the French Communist Party cherishes the solidarity and assistance of fraternal parties to it.

　　The telegram went on to say that the struggle on the ideological front carried out by the communist and workers' parties of various countries has achieved results. This struggle made it possible to repel the frantic attacks of international reactionaries in 1956. This struggle has made the communist and workers' parties of various countries more united in the face of the insidious attacks of revisionism. Our Party followed the line of the Fourteenth Congress and launched a struggle against revisionism.

　　The correctness of this struggle, which is still going on, has been confirmed by the Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto of Sixty-Four Communist and Workers' Parties adopted in Moscow last November. Our Party has expressed its full agreement with the Moscow Declaration because it reflects the fighting unity of the fraternal parties linked by proletarian internationalism.

　　The telegram concluded by saying that the actions and achievements of the socialist camp, with the Soviet Union as its model and beacon, help the French Communist Party in its tireless struggle against fascism, colonialism, and the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and for the victory of democracy and socialism in our country.

　　法共中央致电保共代表大会表示
    社会主义阵营的行动和成就  有助于法共反法西斯的斗争
    新华社索非亚4日电　保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会3日会议上宣读了法国共产党中央委员会的贺电。贺电说，法国共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，衷心地祝贺大会获得重大成就。我们没有能够像预定的那样派遣由杜克洛同志所率领的代表团参加代表大会。你们知道，目前我们党正在全力进行重大的斗争，保卫共和国和民族，反对戴高乐所策划的阴谋。戴高乐和其他将军以及热衷于内战的人依靠法国和阿尔及利亚的反动势力和殖民主义势力的支持，企图推翻共和国制度和建立法西斯专政。在当前斗争中，我们党和工人阶级坚决站在保卫共和国斗争的最前列。
    贺电说，面临着法西斯的威胁，我们党在更加努力地团结社会党工人和共产党工人，来克服工人阶级队伍中的分裂和加强法国人民的团结。
    保卫共和国的意志在不断加强。今年5月28日有历史意义的示威游行时，巴黎居民在走过各共和党派和各种工会组织的领导人前面时表明了他们粉碎叛乱阴谋的不可动摇的决心。在这严重的关头，法国共产党很珍视兄弟党对它的声援和帮助。
    贺电接着说，各国共产党和工人党所进行的思想战线上的斗争已经取得了成果。这个斗争使得在1956年击退了国际反动派的猖狂进攻。这个斗争使各国共产党和工人党在修正主义阴险的进攻面前更加团结一致。我们党遵循第十四次代表大会的路线对修正主义展开了斗争。
    直到现在还在进行的这一斗争的正确性，已为去年11月在莫斯科所通过的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言以及六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言所证实。我们党曾经表示完全赞同莫斯科宣言，因为它反映了由无产阶级国际主义所联系起来的各兄弟党的战斗团结。
    贺电最后说，以苏联为模范和灯塔的社会主义阵营的行动和成就，有助于法国共产党反对法西斯主义、殖民主义，反对北大西洋公约组织的侵略计划，争取民主和社会主义在我国取得胜利的不倦斗争。
