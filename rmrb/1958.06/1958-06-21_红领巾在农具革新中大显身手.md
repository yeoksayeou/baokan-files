The Communist Youth League Committee of Lintao County, Gansu Province

    Recently, Lintao County held a special district-wide conference to promote technological revolution, with over 3,000 representatives exhibiting more than 10,000 innovative production tools. This was truly a grand gathering of heroes, a flourishing of a hundred flowers. A new feature of this conference was that, among the exhibited tools, 2,336 were created and invented by the county's children. Particularly noteworthy were the wind-powered rice mill, wind-powered waterwheel, water-powered gunpowder grinder, channel pulley soil lifter, lever soil lifter, and solar stove created by twelve-year-old Young Pioneer Song Xihong and fourteen-year-old Zhang Yufu. These children, wearing their red scarves, were also seen everywhere seeking advice and learning from the attending uncles and elders. The Party and League organizations and the conference gave great support to their actions. Several tools they created have been technically appraised and are to be promoted and used throughout the special district.

    For these children, their knowledge and experience are still very immature; they are still in a period of growth and learning. However, they have made achievements in the technological revolution movement. This is mainly because their direction is correct and they have grasped the truth. Their young hearts are closely linked to the general line of socialist construction in the motherland. Zhang Yufu, the son of a printing worker, was so excited upon hearing the Party's great decision to divert the Tao River over 2,000 meters to the high mountains and completely change the arid landscape of central Gansu that he couldn't sleep for several nights. In April, in preparation for the special district's technological revolution promotion conference, the streets of Lintao County were plastered with reports of workers and peasants creating tools. Teachers also gathered in groups of three or five to study tools, and the Young Pioneer brigade headquarters invited people to give reports to the members, calling on them to participate in the county's technological revolution movement. Zhang Yufu thought, "What can I contribute to the Party?" He recalled participating in voluntary labor on the Linkang Canal last year with his classmates. Each person could only carry twenty or thirty pounds of soil at a time from the deep ditches, causing people to gasp for breath and sweat, and the efficiency was very low. How could they do it better, faster, more efficiently, and more economically, to reduce labor? How could they bring the water of the Tao River to the arid land as soon as possible and increase grain production for the country? Using some of the mechanical principles he learned in natural science class, and referring to the local lifting poles and the school's flagpole pulley, he repeatedly pondered, drew diagrams, and made models with bamboo poles and paper. Finally, he created two types of soil lifting tools: a pulley and a lever. The channel pulley soil lifter can lift 500 pounds of soil at a time, and the lever soil lifter can be operated by four people to lift 1,000 pounds of soil at a time. The height can also be adjusted according to the depth of the channel. His uncle's family had a grinding stone that was used by a factory to grind gunpowder for blasting rocks on the mountain. He thought, how slow this is! How much gunpowder is needed for the Tao River project? If the efficiency of grinding gunpowder could be improved, it would also be a good thing for the Tao River diversion project. He imitated the principle of a water-powered mill and created a water-powered gunpowder mill. After appraisal, it was found that using this water-powered mill to grind gunpowder could increase efficiency by five to eighteen times. These three tools he created have already been promoted in the Tao River diversion project. The Party, League, and team organizations gave great support to Zhang Yufu's creations, helping him to correct and test the models and affirming the results. The League and team organizations widely publicized Zhang Yufu's deeds throughout the county, and soon a mass movement took shape. Thirteen-year-old team member Cai Zongli saw that many people in the agricultural cooperative were following behind double-wheeled double-furrow plows to break up soil clods every day, so he designed a model of a soil clod breaking machine that could replace human labor. As the summer harvest break approached, the children linked wheat harvesting and hairdressing together and were jointly designing a wheat harvesting machine. While cleaning the school with watering cans, the children thought of making a machine for artificial rainfall. In short, the children's hearts were closely linked to the country's production and construction.

    Another characteristic of these children is that their thinking is open, they dare to think and dare to do, they fear nothing, they have no worries, they do not worry about gains and losses, they have no superstitions, and they earnestly work on anything they grasp, "investigating to the very end." That is how Zhang Yufu thought. Because people wanted to go to the sky, airplanes were created; because people wanted to go to the moon, rockets and satellites were created. Zhang Yufu envisioned that in the future, a chain could be built from Earth to the moon. After creating the solar stove, Song Xihong is envisioning further increasing the temperature to be used for steelmaking. With the help of teachers, the temperature of the solar stove has now reached around 500 degrees.

    Some people also worry that if children engage in these activities, it will affect their studies and health. In fact, quite the opposite. Because the children have a lofty ideal of contributing more to the socialist motherland, they are grasping their studies even more tightly. Zhang Yufu gets almost all five points in exams. Song Xihong is reading Ilin's "100,000 Whys." They are more concerned about the things around them, and their studies are more serious. By making models, they also learned simple carpentry skills such as sawing and planing. Their feelings for the working people have become closer, they have experienced the greatness and loveliness of labor, and they have become more protective of public property. Through mutual learning, visits, encouragement, and inspiration between teachers and students, especially with the specific leadership and help of the League and team organizations, the relationships between students, between high and low grades, between the League and the team, and between counselors and team members have become closer and more united. The team members also love the League and team organizations even more. In short, after this month-long activity, the children have grown by leaps and bounds in all aspects.

    Through this practically significant activity, we deeply feel that, in addition to school education, the education and training of children must closely link their activities with the Party's policies, lines, national social activities, revolutionary struggles, and production struggles. We must lead the children into social life, let them do what they can, and influence, cultivate, and educate them in all aspects through social activities. Practice has proven that linking children's educational activities with the Party's line, policies, and the cause of socialist construction from an early age, and attracting them to participate in work and labor within their capabilities, will more quickly and healthily cultivate them into communist successors with a communist spirit. This year, the children of Lintao County not only carried out activities in the technological revolution, but also did a lot of work in national movements such as greening the motherland, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating the four pests. These specific activities also educated those "anti-rash advance" factions in juvenile work, broke the taboo that team activities must be centered around regular classes, and shattered the superstition that engaging in off-campus activities would lead to chaos, that children would become unruly, and that it would affect their healthy growth. Another inspiration from this activity is that we must trust children and let them carry out independent activities. Our responsibility lies in better guiding and promoting their simple and precious qualities of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, having no superstitions, grasping the truth, persisting to the end, fearing nothing, and daring to charge forward. We must not take over and do things for them, and we must not distrust the children. This time, after discovering Zhang Yufu's story, the Lintao County League and team organizations vigorously supported and widely publicized it. On the stage of juvenile heroes in the county, Zhang Yufu was not the only solo hero. Twelve-year-old Song Xihong then jumped up, thirteen-year-old Cai Zongli jumped up, and fourteen-year-olds Song Xinyi, Wang Xiaoming, Wang Yulan, Luo Dahui, etc., all jumped onto the hero's stage one after another, team after team. In less than a month, in just one school, Second Junior High, with 1,330 students, 342 Young Pioneers created 621 tools and models. Mr. Kang, the homeroom teacher of Song Xihong's class, originally did not believe that children could do anything, and even vowed, "If these teenagers can invent tools, I'll walk backwards!" In the face of a large number of facts, he lost, and he admitted defeat. Mr. Kang took the initiative to examine his thoughts and practices of not believing in children, looking down on children, and doing things for them. These vivid facts are a most profound education for all of us who work with children in the county.

    红领巾在农具革新中大显身手
    共青团甘肃省临洮县委书记　杨炳武
    最近，在临洮县召开了全专区的技术革命促进大会，三千多名代表，展出一万多件创造发明的生产工具，这真是一次英雄云集，百花齐放的盛会。这次会上一个新的特点是：在展出的一万多件新工具中，有二千三百三十六件是全县少年儿童创造发明的。特别引人注意的是十二岁的少先队员宋希宏和十四岁的张裕福所创造的风力碾米机、风力水车、水力碾火药盘、渠道滑轮起土机、杠杆起土机和太阳能灶等。这些带着红领巾的小朋友，也到处向到会的叔叔伯伯们请教、学习。党团组织和大会对他们的行为给了很大的支持。他们创造的几种工具已经过技术鉴定，决定在全专区推广使用。
    对于这些少年儿童来说，他们的知识和经验都还是极不成熟的，他们还正处在成长和学习的时期，但是，在技术革命运动中他们作出了成绩，这主要是他们的方向正确，抓住了真理，他们幼小的心和祖国的社会主义建设总路线紧密地联系在一起了。印刷工人的儿子张裕福，当他听到党提出要把洮河引上两千多公尺的高山，彻底改变甘肃中部干旱面貌的伟大决定后，兴奋得几夜睡不安稳。4月，临洮县为了迎接专区召开的技术革命促进会，大街上贴满了工人农民创造工具的喜报，老师们也三、五个人聚在一起研究工具，少先队大队部还请人给队员们作了报告，号召队员们参加全县的技术革命运动。张裕福想：“我能给党贡献些什么呢？”他回想去年和同学们一道去参加临康渠的义务劳动，从几丈深的沟中一个人一次只能背二、三十斤土，把人挣得气喘汗流，效率还很低。怎样才能做得好些、快些、多些、省些，减轻人的劳动呢？怎样才能早日将洮河的水灌上干旱的土地，为国家增产粮食呢？他用在自然课中学习到的一些机械原理知识，参照当地提水用的扬杆和学校升旗用的滑轮，经过反复琢磨，画图，用竹竿和纸片制模型，终于制成了滑轮和杠杆两种起土工具。渠道滑轮起土机一次可起土五百斤，杠杆起土机四人操作，一次可起土一千斤，使用时还可以按渠道深浅调整高低。他伯父家中有一盘碾子给工厂承碾炸石山的火药，他想，这多么慢呀！洮河工程需要多少火药，如果能提高碾火药的效率，这对引洮工程也是一件好事情。他模仿水力磨的原理，制成了水力碾火药碾，经过鉴定，用这种水力碾碾火药，可以提高工效五倍到十八倍。他所创造的这三种工具，已经在引洮工程中推广。党团和队的组织对张裕福的这些创造，给了很大的支持，帮助他校正试制模型肯定效果。团和队的组织，在全县广泛宣传张裕福的事迹，不久就形成了群众性的活动。十三岁的队员蔡宗礼看见农业社每天许多人跟在双轮双铧犁后面打土块，设计了一种能代替人力的打土块机模型。夏收放忙假的日子近了，孩子们把割麦和理发连想在一起，正共同设计着一种割麦机。在打扫学校卫生用洒壶的时候，孩子们就想到做人工降雨的机器。总之，孩子们的心和祖国的生产建设紧紧地连在一起了。
    这些小朋友的另一个特点是：他们的思想开阔，敢想敢干，天不怕，地不怕，他们没有什么顾虑，不患得患失，没有迷信，抓住一点就认真的干下去，“打破沙锅问到底”，张裕福就是这样想的。因为人想上天才有了飞机，人想上月球，才有了火箭、卫星，张裕福设想，将来可以在地球到月球上搭一条链子。宋希宏在搞出太阳能灶之后，正在设想进一步提高温度用来炼钢，在老师的帮助下，现在太阳能灶的温度已经达到五百度左右。
    也有人担心，儿童们这样搞，会不会影响他们的学习和健康。事实上，恰恰相反，由于孩子们有了立志为社会主义祖国多做一些事的远大理想，他们对学习抓得更紧了。张裕福在考试中几乎全是五分。宋希宏在读着伊林的“十万个为什么”。他们对周围的事物更关心了，学习也更加认真了。由于试制模型，他们还学会了拉锯、刨光等简单的木匠活。他们和劳动人民的感情进一步密切了，他们体会到劳动的伟大和可爱，对公共财产也更加爱护了。通过老师、同学们互相学习、访问、鼓励、启发，特别是团、队组织的具体领导、帮助，同学们之间的关系，高、低年级之间的关系，团和队的关系，辅导员和队员的关系，都更加密切、团结了，队员也更加热爱团、队的组织。总之，经过这一个多月的活动，儿童们在各方面都飞跃地成长起来了。
    通过这一有现实意义的活动，使我们深深地感到：对儿童的教育培养，除了通过学校教育外，一定要把儿童的活动和党的政策、路线、全民的社会活动、革命斗争和生产斗争紧密地连系起来，把孩子们引到社会生活中去，让他们做力所能及的工作，通过社会活动从各方面影响、培养和教育儿童。实践证明，从小就把儿童的教育活动同党的路线政策和社会主义建设事业连在一起，吸引他们参加力所能及的工作和劳动，就会更迅速、更健康地把他们培养成为具有共产主义精神的共产主义接班人。今年临洮县的儿童不仅在技术革命中开展了活动，同样在绿化祖国、讲卫生、除四害等全民性运动中也干了很多工作，通过这些具体活动，也教育了那些在少年儿童工作中的“反冒进”派，打破了那种队的活动一定要围绕正课开展的清规戒律，打破了搞校外活动会出乱子、儿童会惯野、会影响儿童健康成长的迷信。这次活动给我们的另一个启示是，要相信儿童，放手让他们开展独立活动。我们的责任，在于更好地引导发扬他们敢想敢说，敢作敢为，没有迷信，抓住真理，坚持到底，天不怕，地不怕，敢于冲锋陷阵的那种朴素而又十分可贵的品德。而不能去包办代替，不相信儿童。这次，临洮县团、队组织，发现张裕福的事情后，就大力支持，广泛宣传。在全县少年英雄擂台上，不仅是张裕福一个单干英雄，十二岁的宋希宏接着跳了上来，十三岁的蔡宗礼跳了上来，十四岁的宋新义、王晓明、王玉兰、罗大慧等等，都一个接一个，一队接一队的跳上了英雄的擂台。不到一个月的时间，仅二初中一个学校一千三百三十个同学中，就有三百四十二个红领巾创造了六百二十一件工具的实物和模型。宋希宏所在班的班主任康老师，原来不相信儿童能作什么，还发誓说：“他们十几岁的娃娃能发明创造工具，我就倒着走路哩！”在大量的事实面前，他输了，也认输了，康老师主动地检查了自己不相信儿童，看不起儿童，包办代替的思想和作法。这些生动的事实，对我们全县作少年工作的人来说，都是一个最深刻的教育。
