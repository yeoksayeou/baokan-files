    Supporting the Great Development of the East China Steel Industry
    Shanghai Rushes to Produce Large Quantities of Smelting Equipment
    According to Xinhua News Agency, faced with the new situation of the rapid development of the East China steel industry, Shanghai is rushing to produce a large quantity of steel smelting equipment.
    The development of the steel industry in East China will establish a solid foundation for the development of industrial and agricultural production in this region, which has a population of over 190 million, and will accelerate our great cause of surpassing Britain.
    In order to realize the great development of the East China steel industry, most of the steel smelting equipment will be manufactured in Shanghai, and it must be rushed out before the second quarter of next year. This equipment includes complete sets of equipment for mining, ore dressing, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling. Among them, there are a large number of blast furnace equipment sets with an annual output of 125,000 tons of pig iron each, a large number of converter equipment sets with an annual output of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tons of steel each, and a large number of complete sets of steel rolling equipment for rolling seamless steel pipes, medium plates, and thin plates. Most of this equipment has never been manufactured in Shanghai before, and it needs to be manufactured and completed under the condition of ensuring the completion of this year's production leap forward plan.
    These days, industrial, construction, and design departments in Shanghai are taking various emergency measures. Manufacturing such a large amount of equipment requires a large amount of steel materials, so the Shanghai steel industry must first develop at a high speed.
    The city's mechanical manufacturing forces have been organized in a unified manner. Many factories of the General, Power, Rotating Electrical Machinery and other seven specialized companies under the Municipal Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau, factories of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai, and even the machine repair departments of light industry, textile industry, shipping and other systems, are successively manufacturing equipment to support the development of the East China steel industry. The power industry department is preparing to take measures to increase power generation to ensure the supply of electricity. The construction department has taken urgent action, and many major capital construction projects in the city must be started and completed ahead of schedule. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, including the army, navy, and air force, has also dispatched a large number of people to participate in the construction of the steel industry.
    Secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee, mayors, and leaders of various industrial departments have gone down to factories these days to understand the situation and help factories overcome specific difficulties. Some factories have established command headquarters, and some factories have assigned three of the four factory directors to specifically lead and implement this task. Designers have changed the design speed, which used to be calculated in years and months, to be calculated in days. Some designers guarantee to shorten the design tasks that used to take one or two quarters to complete to ten days. Workers at the Red Flag Machine Manufacturing Factory couldn't wait for the new factory buildings and bamboo sheds to be built, so they started manufacturing converter steelmaking equipment in the open-air site. Without a seven-ton crane, they used two three-and-a-half-ton cranes to replace it. The large machine frame required for the new thin plate workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant weighs as much as 26 tons each. Placing it on any machine tool in the factory for processing would crush the machine tool; however, the factory's mechanical workers came up with a good way to break the routine: they stood the large machine frame (workpiece) on the ground without moving, and used two improved small planers to cut around it.

### 支援华东钢铁工业大发展  上海赶制大量冶炼设备

    支援华东钢铁工业大发展
    上海赶制大量冶炼设备
    据新华社讯　面临着华东钢铁工业飞跃发展的新形势，上海正在赶制大量钢铁冶炼设备。
    华东地区发展钢铁工业，将为这个拥有一亿九千多万人口的地区发展工农业生产建立巩固的基础，并且加速我国赶过英国的伟大事业。
    为了实现华东钢铁工业大发展，大部分钢铁冶炼设备都由上海制造，而且要在明年第二季度以前赶制出来。这些设备包括开矿、选矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢到轧钢的各种成套设备。其中，有大批的每套年产十二万五千吨生铁的高炉设备，大批的每套年产几万吨到十几万吨钢的转炉设备，大批轧制无缝钢管、中板、薄板的成套轧钢设备。这些设备的大部分，上海过去都没有制造过，需要在保证完成今年生产跃进计划的条件下制造完成。
    这几天，上海各个工业、建筑、设计部门都在采取各种紧急措施。制造这样大量的设备需要大量的钢铁材料，上海钢铁工业就首先以高速度进行大发展。
    全市的机械制造力量已统一组织起来。市机电工业局所属通用、动力、旋转电机等七个专业公司的许多工厂，第一机械工业部在上海的工厂，甚至轻工业、纺织工业、海运等系统的机修部门，都在陆续为发展华东钢铁工业突击制造设备。电力工业部门准备采取措施，增加发电量，来保证电力的供应。建筑部门已紧张行动起来，全市有许多项主要基本建设工程都要提前开工、提前完工。中国人民解放军驻上海的陆海空三军，也抽调出大批人马来参加钢铁工业的建设。
    中共市委书记们、市长们，以及各个工业部门的领导人员，这几天接连下到工厂，了解情况，帮助工厂克服具体困难。有的工厂已成立指挥部，有的工厂在四个厂长中抽出三个厂长来具体领导执行这个任务。设计人员们把过去以年、月计算的设计速度，改为以日计算。有些设计人员保证把过去要一两个季度才能完成的设计任务，缩短到十天完成。红旗机器制造厂的工人们等不及新盖厂房和搭竹棚，就先在露天场地上开始制造转炉炼钢设备，没有七吨的吊车设备，他们就用两台三吨半的吊车来代替。上海第三钢铁厂新建薄板车间所需要的大机架，每只重达二十六吨，放在厂里的任何一台机床上去加工，都要把机床压垮；可是厂里机械工人却想出了打破常规的好办法：把大机架（工作物）立在地上不动，用两台改进过的小刨床围绕着它切削。（附图片）
