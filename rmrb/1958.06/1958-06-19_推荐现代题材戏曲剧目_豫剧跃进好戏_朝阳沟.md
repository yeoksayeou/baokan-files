Recommending Modern Theme Opera
Henan Opera's Great Leap Forward Masterpiece "Chaoyanggou"
Lin Hanbiao

    "Chaoyanggou," which the Henan Henan Opera Troupe No. 3 has brought to Beijing for this performance, is a large-scale modern drama created during the Great Leap Forward. It tells the story of two middle school graduates participating in agricultural production to transform their thinking, mainly focusing on the ideological changes of middle school graduate Yinhuan after arriving in Chaoyanggou. It also reflects, to a certain extent, the new style and new outlook of the socialist rural working masses. Due to the authors, directors, and actors' familiarity with rural life and their love for the working people, the characters in this play are written quite vividly. The image of Suanbao's mother, another middle school graduate, is also very lovable. She is kind-hearted, warm and cheerful towards others, and loves the new society and the Communist Party. Such women are not uncommon in contemporary rural areas. The Party Branch Secretary doesn't appear much, but the image is also very vivid. Yinhuan is also written well. She has personal fantasies and ambitions but does not love agricultural labor and is unwilling to be a farmer for the rest of her life. After Yinhuan reluctantly arrives in Chaoyanggou, she fears hardship and is uneasy. Coupled with her mother, who runs a cigarette stall in the county town, holding her back, she naturally wants to sneak away. Later, under the education and help of the Party Branch Secretary and the masses, she transforms and is willing to contribute her youth to socialism. This character is written quite realistically and has typical significance. Yinhuan's path shows that it is most glorious and pleasant for young intellectuals to participate in physical labor to transform themselves and dedicate their youth to the cause of socialism. Using opera to express the current great socialist revolution, to express the great socialist construction, and to create typical images of contemporary people is an urgent task. The efforts made by the Henan Henan Opera Troupe No. 3 in this regard are very valuable, and we need a large number of such new operas!
    "Chaoyanggou" also has many advantages in its performance. The author has fully utilized the Henan Opera's characteristic of being good at singing. The play has beautiful tunes that can express character, and the lyrics are also very vivid and expressive. The director is talented, and he used farce techniques to make the whole play lively and colorful, highlighting the characters in many comedic performances. Like Suanbao's mother, every song, every line, every action can deeply express her character traits. Several scenes involving Yinhuan and Suanbao's younger sister are also very clever. For example, after Yinhuan transforms, she shares a quilt with Suanbao's younger sister and they talk. The two take turns singing and lying down together, vividly expressing the mental state of young girls. The scene of learning to read in the fields is also handled very well. Through beautiful question-and-answer style leading vocals and choruses, and through dance, the play vividly expresses the vigorous spirit of the socialist new rural working masses and the leap-forward spirit of the peasants.
    This play also has shortcomings, mainly the lack of depiction of real-life conflicts, and the characters' personalities are not fully displayed in real conflicts. The contradiction between Yinhuan and Suanbao exists, but we rarely see Suanbao's struggle and help for Yinhuan. Suanbao seemed too impatient before going to the countryside, and lacked sincere help for Yinhuan after going to the countryside. Because the contradictions are not fully developed, Yinhuan's transformation seems a bit flimsy, and Suanbao's character also seems unclear, making the main line of the second half of the play blurred.

    推荐现代题材戏曲剧目
    豫剧跃进好戏“朝阳沟”
    林涵表
    河南豫剧院三团这次来京公演的“朝阳沟”，是他们在大跃进中创作的大型现代戏。它写的是两个中学毕业生参加农业生产改造思想的故事，主要写中学毕业生银环到朝阳沟后的思想变化，也在一定程度上反映出社会主义农村劳动群众的新风格新面貌。由于作者、导演、演员们对农村生活的熟识，对劳动人民的热爱，这出戏的人物是写得相当生动的。剧中另一个中学毕业生拴宝的娘的形象也十分可爱，她心地慈善，对人热情爽朗，热爱新社会，热爱共产党。在当代的农村中，这样的妇女是不少见的。党支书出场不多，但形象也很生动。银环也写得不错。她有个人的幻想和抱负，但不爱农业劳动，不甘心一辈子当农民。当银环勉强到朝阳沟以后，怕吃苦，不安心，加上她那个在县城里摆香烟摊的妈妈拖后腿，她便自然地想偷偷溜号。后来，她在党支书和群众的教育帮助下转变了，她愿意为社会主义贡献自己的青春。这个人物写得相当真实，有典型意义。银环的道路表明了青年知识分子参加体力劳动改造自己，把青春献给社会主义事业，才是最光荣最愉快的事。以戏曲来表现当前的伟大社会主义革命，表现伟大社会主义建设，创造出当代人的典型形象，是刻不容缓的任务，河南豫剧院三团在这方面所作的努力是很可贵的，我们需要大量的这种新戏曲！
    “朝阳沟”在演出上也有许多优点。作者充分地发挥了豫剧善唱的特点，剧中有优美而能表现性格的唱腔，唱词也很生动形象。导演是有才能的，他运用了闹剧的手法把整个戏搞得有声有色，使人物在许多喜剧性的表演当中突出了。像拴宝娘，一唱一白一举一动都能深刻地表现她的性格特征。银环和拴宝的妹妹有几段戏也很巧妙。例如银环转变后和拴宝妹妹睡在一个被窝里谈心，两个人轮流着一起一卧，抒情对唱，生动地表现了年轻姑娘的精神状貌。田间识字一场，也处理得很好。通过优美的问答式的领唱和合唱，通过舞蹈，鲜明地表现了社会主义新农村劳动群众朝气勃勃的精神面貌，表现了农民的跃进气概。
    这出戏也有不足之处，主要是缺少真正的生活冲突的描写，人物性格不能在真正的矛盾冲突中充分展示出来。银环与拴宝之间的矛盾是存在的，但我们很少看到拴宝对银环的斗争与帮助。下乡前拴宝显得太暴躁，下乡后拴宝对银环也缺乏真诚的帮助。矛盾展不开，银环的转变就有点轻飘，拴宝的性格也因此显得不鲜明，后半部的戏也就主线模糊了。
