Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 15th. Rare large mica sheets have been discovered in Yunnan. Some individual pieces weigh more than forty jin and are as large as four square feet.

These mica sheets are sparkling, transparent, and free of impurities, with high toughness. They are rare insulating materials for large-scale telecommunications equipment. The larger the area of the mica sheet, the more valuable it is, and such large mica sheets have rarely been found domestically.

These large mica sheets were recently discovered by dozens of cadres who were sent to work in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture while mining quartz.

    四十多斤重的云母片
    新华社昆明15日电　云南发现罕见的大云母片，其中有的一块重达四十多斤，片大达四平方尺。
    这些云母片晶莹闪光、透明无杂质，韧性很强，是大型电讯器材上难得的绝缘材料。云母片面积越大越珍贵，国内还很少发现这样大的云母片。
    这些大云母片是德宏傣族景颇族自治州的几十名下放干部最近在挖掘水晶石时发现的。
