    Engineers Lose the Competition
    By our reporters Ji Qun and Yang Ying

    Recently, an unusual piece of news has been widely circulating in the state-owned Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory: in a competition to improve diesel engine design, highly skilled engineers lost.

    Not long ago, the factory leadership adopted an improved design plan jointly formulated by young technicians and veteran workers. According to this plan, by modifying only four parts, the original 40-horsepower diesel engine could be turned into a 60-horsepower engine, and the original 60-horsepower diesel engine could be turned into a 90-horsepower engine. Moreover, fuel consumption would also be greatly reduced. The 40-horsepower to 60-horsepower diesel engine, after a small batch trial production, has begun mass production, with an estimated 600 units to be produced this year.

    With the leaps forward in industry, agriculture, fisheries, and transportation, the demand for diesel engines has greatly increased. How to improve the function of the diesel engine itself is an important issue. For example, if each cylinder on the original diesel engine could only generate ten horsepower, if it could be improved to generate fifteen horsepower, without increasing equipment or adding personnel, diesel engine horsepower output could be increased by 50%, saving a large amount of metal materials. The engineers of the Diesel Engine Factory's Design Department, under the direction of Chief Design Engineer Xu Zhengyi, conducted six months of research on this issue in the office, starting in the third quarter of last year. They finally proposed an improved design that required changing more than twenty kinds of parts and over two hundred kinds of processing tools, almost completely overturning the current process route, in a word, equivalent to developing a new product. However, a 60-horsepower diesel engine made according to this improved design plan, after repeated testing, its horsepower consistently hovered around 85, failing to reach 90, and its fuel consumption was as high as the original diesel engine. When the workers offered improvement suggestions to the engineers, they not only didn't accept them but blamed the failure of the experiment on poor worker operation.

    The workers, having gone through the rectification movement, not only dared to offer opinions to the engineers but also dared to bring out their own improved diesel engine designs to compete with the engineers. The workers posted big-character posters questioning the leadership: "Why not adopt the testing workshop's plan?" It turned out that young technician Zhou Chao and veteran workers Guo Junfu, Ren Haiyun, Zhang Maojin, and others in the testing workshop had already studied this issue in the spring of 1957. During six months of intense work, they conducted hundreds of tests, constantly learning from failures, and finally concluded that by improving the cylinder head and piston, the fuel consumption per horsepower per hour could be reduced from 205 cubic centimeters to 197 cubic centimeters. They also discovered that because the diesel fuel burned more fully in the cylinder, even without increasing the speed, a 40-horsepower diesel engine could produce 48 horsepower. From this experiment, it could be deduced that if the speed were increased from 1,200 rpm to 1,500 rpm, the horsepower could be further increased. Zhou Chao and others excitedly wrote these findings in a written summary and sent it to the Design Department, hoping that the engineers would use it as a reference for improved design. However, the engineers in the Design Department, without even visiting the testing workshop beforehand, and after reading their written summary, considered it "lacking technical basis." In a word, they simply looked down on the experiment and insisted on developing their own plan behind closed doors.

    Zhou Chao and veteran worker Guo Junfu, with the support of the workshop Party branch and the workers, decided to compete with the engineers. They borrowed a 40-horsepower diesel engine from the assembly workshop, found the improved cylinder head and piston parts from last year's experiments in the warehouse, and modified the governor flyweights and governor spring. They conducted experiments day and night in three shifts. After the experiment was successful on the 40-horsepower diesel engine, they switched to the 60-horsepower diesel engine for testing. On the day before New Year's Eve, they were busy until late at night. All the parts had been modified and were ready to be installed on the 60-horsepower diesel engine for the final test. Zhou Chao, Guo Junfu, and others felt both nervous and happy, as if they were awaiting the birth of a new life. The experiment was unexpectedly smooth. When the machine started, the pointer on the instrument measuring horsepower quickly went from 60 horsepower to 90 horsepower, then 99 horsepower. Zhou Chao and Guo Junfu were overjoyed, indicating that this 60-horsepower diesel engine could be used as a 90-horsepower engine.

    To improve the efficiency of diesel engine horsepower, there were two different plans before the people: the plan of young technician Zhou Chao and the veteran workers involved fewer part changes, had better results, and could be put into production immediately; while the engineers' plan involved more part changes, could not be put into production this year, and had relatively poor results. Which plan was more in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results? Wasn't the matter clear? However, the engineers, especially the person in charge of this improved design work, were unwilling to admit defeat. On the one hand, they worked day and night to intensify the experiment, determined to compete with the young technician and the workers, and on the other hand, they nitpicked the other party's improved design plan.

    The Diesel Engine Factory's Party Committee saw that the time was ripe and decided to hold a debate to discuss and decide which plan to adopt.

    The debate began on February 26. The participants included engineers, technicians, veteran workers, and the Party Committee Secretary, the factory manager, etc. At the meeting, both sides brought a large stack of materials. The meeting implemented the spirit of presenting facts and reasoning things out. First, the content, test results, advantages, and disadvantages of the two programs were introduced. And on the two test benches, the two improved designed diesel engines were performed on the spot, and then a comprehensive comparison and debate was launched. Some people who originally suspected that the improvement design plan of the young technicians and old workers was not feasible were completely convinced in the face of facts. But some engineers proposed that technical research should not consider economic effects, and the improvement design plan of young technicians is not perfect and other views. These arguments could not stand up to refutation. In the end, everyone believed that according to the Diesel Engine Factory's task of tripling production this year and starting from the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, the plan of the young technicians and the old workers was obviously good, and the engineers' plan was both slow and expensive. Although theoretically speaking, this plan might extend the life of the machine, it had not been verified by testing. At the same time, some of the reasonable parts of the plan were pointed out that the plan could be continued in the future. Finally, the factory director publicly decided to adopt the improved design plan jointly formulated by young technicians and workers.

    工程师比输了
    本报记者　季群　杨瑛
    最近，国营上海柴油机厂盛传着一件不寻常的新闻：在改进柴油机设计的一场竞赛中，技术高明的工程师们比输了。
    不久以前，这个厂的领导采纳了青年技术员和老工人们合作制定的一个改进设计方案。按照这个方案，只要改动四个零件，就能使原来是四十马力的柴油机变为六十马力；原来是六十马力的柴油机可以变成九十马力。而且耗油量也大为降低。现在四十马力变六十马力的一种柴油机，经过小批试制以后，开始成批生产，预计今年要生产六百台。
    随着工业、农业、渔业、交通运输业的跃进，柴油机的需要量大大增加了，如何提高柴油机本身的功能是一个重要的课题，譬如原来柴油机上的每一个汽缸只能发出十马力，如果改进一下，让它发出十五马力，这样，不增加设备，不添人，就可以增产柴油机50％的马力，节省大量金属材料。柴油机厂设计科的工程师们在主任设计工程师许正义主持下，从去年三季度开始在办公室里对这个问题进行了六个月的研究，最后提出了一个改进设计方案，一共需要改变二十多种零件，要改变二百多种加工工具，几乎全部推翻了现在的工艺路线，一句话等于搞一个新产品。但是，按照这个改进设计方案做出来的一台六十马力柴油机，试来试去，马力始终在八十五上下，达不到九十，耗油量也和原来的柴油机一样费油。工人们对工程师提出改进意见，他们不但不接受，反把试验不成功的原因，归之于工人操作不好。
    经过整风运动的工人们，不但敢于向工程师提意见，而且还敢于拿出自己改进设计的柴油机来与工程师们比赛。工人们贴出大字报责问领导：“为什么不采用试验车间的方案？”原来试验车间的青年技术员周超和老工人郭君福、任海云、张茂金等早在1957年春天，就研究过这个问题，他们在六个月的紧张劳动中作过几百次试验，不断从失败中吸取教训，最后得出了结论：只要对汽缸头和活塞加以改进，每小时每马力的耗油量便能从二百零五公分降低到一百九十七公分，并且也发现因为柴油在汽缸里燃烧得充分，即使不增加转速，四十马力的柴油机就可以发出四十八马力。从这试验，可以推算出如果每分钟转速从一千二百转增加到一千五百，马力还可以往上提。周超等兴奋地把这些写成书面总结，送给设计科，等待工程师们作改进设计的参考。而设计科的工程师们，事前既没有到试验车间去看一下，在读了他们的书面总结后，又认为“缺乏技术根据”。一句话，根本看不上这个试验，硬是要关起门来另搞一套。
    周超和老工人郭君福等在车间党支部和工人们的支持下，决心和工程师们赛一赛。他们向装配车间借了一台四十马力的柴油机，到仓库里找出去年试验中改进过的汽缸头和活塞等零件，又改制了调速器飞铁和调速弹簧，日夜三班的进行试验，在四十马力柴油机上试验成功了，又换到六十马力柴油机上去试验。除夕前一天，他们几个人一直忙到深夜，一切零件都改好了，只待装到六十马力柴油机上去作最后的试验，周超和郭君福等的心情是又紧张又愉快，仿佛在期待着一个新生命的降生似的。试验出乎意外的顺利，当机器发动以后，仪表上测定马力功能的指针迅速地从六十马力指向九十马力、九十九马力时，周超、郭君福的心花怒放了，这说明这台六十马力的柴油机可以作为九十马力使用了。
    为了提高柴油机马力的效能，摆在人们面前的是两个不同的方案：青年技术员周超和老工人们的方案是零件改得少，效果比较好，马上就可投入生产；而工程师们的方案呢，零件改得多，今年不可能投入生产，效果也比较差。究竟那一个方案更加符合多快好省的原则呢？事情不是清清楚楚的吗？可是，工程师们，尤其是主持这项改进设计工作的人心里不服输，一方面自己夜以继日地加紧试验，决心要和青年技术员和工人较量一番，另方面又对对方的改进设计方案加以挑剔。
    柴油机厂的中共党委会看到时机已经成熟，决定召开辩论会由大家来讨论决定究竟采纳那一个方案好。
    2月26日辩论会开始了，参加这次会的有工程师、技术员、老工人和党委书记、厂长等。会上，双方都带来了一大叠资料，会议贯彻了摆事实，讲道理的精神，首先介绍了两个方案的内容、试验结果和优缺点。并且在两个试验台上对两台改进设计后的柴油机当场作了表演，然后展开全面的比较和辩论。有些原来怀疑青年技术员和老工人的改进设计方案不行的人，在事实前面也完全信服了。但是有些工程师提出：从事技术研究，就不能考虑经济效果，青年技术员们的改进设计方案并不是十全十美等等看法。这些论点都是经不起辩驳的。最后，大家认为根据柴油机厂今年生产任务翻三番和从多快好省原则出发，青年技术员和老工人们的方案显然是好的，而工程师们的方案是既慢又费，虽然从理论上来说，这方案可能使机器延长寿命，但是还未经试验证实，同时，也指出这个方案的某些合理部分，今后可以继续试验。最后，厂长当众决定了采纳青年技术员和工人们合作制定的改进设计方案。
