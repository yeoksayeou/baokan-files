    China's rice
    Rice is one of China's important food crops. Among grain crops, it has the highest yield per unit area and accounts for the largest proportion of total grain output. According to 1957 statistics, the average yield per unit area was 358.8 *jin*, and rice production accounted for 46.9% of total grain production.
    China has a warm climate and abundant rainfall. Rice has been cultivated for about 5,000 years. It is a world-renowned rice-producing country and one of the countries with the longest history of rice cultivation.
    Based on natural conditions, China's rice-producing areas can be divided into: Southern rice region (including Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, and Taiwan provinces and regions), where rice paddy fields account for more than 32% of the total rice paddy field area; Central rice region (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, etc.), accounting for 61% of the total rice paddy field area in the country; and Northern rice region (including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, etc.), accounting for approximately 6% of the total rice paddy field area.
    In terms of the timing of cultivation and the length of the growing season, rice cultivated in southern China is generally divided into early rice, mid-season rice, and late rice. Early rice refers to rice that is sown in early spring and has a total growing season of less than 120 days from sowing to harvesting. Mid-season rice refers to rice that is sown in the spring and has a total growing season of less than 150 days. Late rice includes single-season late rice and double-season late rice. Single-season late rice is sown in the spring and takes 150 to 180 days from sowing to harvest. Double-season late rice is generally sown in early summer, transplanted during "Great Heat," and harvested during "Frost's Descent."
    Since liberation, rice production has developed rapidly. From 1949 to 1952, production increased by 40.7%. By the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, rice production had increased to 173.5 billion *jin*, an increase of 78.5% compared to 1949 and an increase of 51.4% compared to the highest pre-war year (1936).
    With the change in cropping systems, the cultivated area of double-season rice has been expanding year by year. According to the planned figures from various provinces, the area of double-season rice this year will reach more than 130 million *mu*, nearly double the increase from 1955. This is a major change in rice production in recent years.

    我国的水稻
    水稻是我国重要粮食作物之一，在谷类作物中单位面积产量最高，在粮食总产量中所占比重也最大。据1957年统计，平均单位产量三百五十八点八斤，稻谷产量占粮食总产量的46.9％。
    我国气候温暖，雨量充沛，种稻已有五千年左右历史，是世界上著名的产米国家和栽稻最悠久的国家之一。
    从自然情况区分，我国的水稻产区有：南方稻区（包括广东、广西、云南、贵州、福建和台湾等省区），稻田的面积占稻田总面积的32％多；中部稻区（包括江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南、四川等），占全国稻田总面积的61％；北方水稻区（包括辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河北、山西、陕西、甘肃、山东、河南、内蒙古、新疆等省区），约占稻田总面积6％多。
    从栽培季节早晚和生长时间长短说，我国南方地区栽培的水稻一般分早稻、中稻和晚稻。早稻是指早春下种，由播种到收割，整个生长期在一百二十天以内的水稻。中稻是指春季下种，整个生长期在一百五十天以内的水稻。晚稻有一季晚稻和双季晚稻两种。一季晚稻春季下种，由播种到收获需要一百五十天到一百八十天。双季晚稻一般在初夏下种，“大暑”插秧，“霜降”收获。
    解放以后，稻谷生产发展的很快，自1949到1952年，产量增长40.7％。到第一个五年计划的最后一年，稻谷产量提高到一千七百三十五亿斤，比1949年的产量增加78.5％，比战前最高年（1936）的产量增加51.4％。
    随着耕作制度的改变，双季稻栽培面积逐年扩大。根据各省计划数字，今年双季稻面积将达一亿三千多万亩，比1955年增加近一倍。这是近年来水稻生产上一个重大的变化。
