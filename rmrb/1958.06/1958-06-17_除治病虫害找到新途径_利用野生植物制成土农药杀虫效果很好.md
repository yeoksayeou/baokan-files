    New Ways Found to Prevent and Treat Pests and Diseases
    Using Wild Plants to Make Indigenous Pesticides Has Good Insecticidal Effects
    (Our dispatch) To ensure the healthy growth of crops and strive for a bumper harvest, farmers in various regions are actively fighting against pests and diseases by using indigenous methods and medicines, as well as a large supply of chemical pesticides from the state.
    The battle to prevent and control crop pests and diseases started long ago. According to the characteristics of this year's pests and diseases occurring earlier due to the warmer winter last year, resulting in a low mortality rate for overwintering pests, the leading organs in various regions have already deployed the work of preventing and controlling pests and diseases; the vast number of farmers, full of energy in the Great Leap Forward, have also made preparations. Therefore, as soon as pests and diseases appeared in the fields, they were put into battle. In April and May, the battle against wheat spider mites, wheat midges, and wheat stem rust in various wheat-producing areas had already achieved victory, guaranteeing a bumper wheat harvest. Since mid-May, some rice paddy areas in the south have launched an encirclement against rice stem borers, rice planthoppers, leafhoppers, and rice blast; the cotton-producing areas have successively launched campaigns to control cotton aphids. At present, the main cotton-producing areas have universally treated cotton aphids about ten days earlier than in previous years; in the locust areas of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, as a result of the encirclement and suppression of locust nymphs, the main force of summer locusts in the main locust areas has been annihilated, preventing the summer locusts from taking flight.
    Many regions have broken with superstition, relied on the masses, and widely used indigenous methods and medicines. The combined use of indigenous methods and medicines with chemical pesticides is one of the main characteristics of this year's pest and disease control, and also an important reason for the significant achievements in pest and disease control in recent months. This year, due to the wide and early occurrence of pests and diseases, the phenomenon of pesticide supply falling short of demand has appeared in various regions. In order to solve this problem, the leading organs in many regions have summarized and promoted the experience of the masses in using indigenous methods and medicines, and have mobilized the masses to boldly think and act, relying on their own wisdom to overcome pest and disease disasters. As a result, dozens of indigenous methods and medicines have been discovered and widely promoted, achieving significant results. For example, in Anhui Province, when preventing and controlling wheat stem rust, in addition to using chemical pesticides, the area treated with indigenous methods and medicines accounted for 42%, with good results. Dancheng County in Henan Province has already stored hundreds of thousands of catties of indigenous medicines, which can be used to treat cotton aphids twice on more than 85,000 mu of cotton fields in the county, fundamentally solving the difficulty of insufficient pesticides.
    The most prominent of the indigenous methods and medicines from the masses in various regions is the extensive use of herbaceous or woody wild plants. The eighteen kinds of indigenous medicines provided by farmers, doctors, and herbal medicine practitioners in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, are all made using wild plants, including: *huangteng* (yellow vine), *haotongqing*, *dahuanghua* (large yellow flower), bayberry bark, poisonous garlic, *matiao*, *faxiazi*, poisonous cocklebur, blood *danggui*, mountain lacquer, *qianjinba*, etc. Sinan County in Guizhou Province, Santai County in Sichuan Province, and other places have used dozens of wild plants to make indigenous medicines. These indigenous medicines are made from local materials, with simple methods, requiring no money or very low cost, and have significant insecticidal effects. Therefore, they are very popular among farmers and are rapidly promoted once advocated. In addition, some employees of the supply and marketing departments in some regions, in order to solve the shortage of urgently needed pesticide varieties or to fundamentally achieve pesticide self-sufficiency, have, with the spirit of daring to think and act, reformed chemical pesticides using indigenous methods after research, or have successfully tested methods of making chemical pesticides using indigenous methods. Employees of the Fengjie County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province, after research, are able to manufacture pesticides such as copper sulfate, egg oil emulsion, lime sulfur mixture, cotton oil soap, and rosin mixture. At present, the supply and marketing department of this county has established nine pharmaceutical factories, and after teaching the pharmaceutical methods to the farmers, the agricultural cooperatives have also established thirty pharmaceutical factories, so that the problem of insufficient pesticides has been basically solved.
    The use of indigenous methods and medicines to prevent and control pests and diseases, especially the use of wild plants to make medicines to control insects, has received the attention of relevant central departments. The person in charge of the relevant departments believes that this is a direction and an important way to solve the current shortage of pesticides. Therefore, they requested that all regions pay attention to it and promote it. In the three months of June, July, and August, which are the peak periods for the successive outbreaks of rice stem borers, rice leaf rollers, rice blast, cotton aphids, cotton bollworms, as well as armyworms, corn borers, potato late blight, and other pests and diseases, the demand for pesticides will increase. In the case of insufficient supply, the relevant departments in various regions must immediately reverse the viewpoint of looking upwards and simply relying on supply, and should immediately face the masses, summarize the experience of the masses in using indigenous medicines and methods, and promote them. The person in charge of the relevant departments believes that the key to the widespread use of indigenous medicines and methods lies in whether or not they can liberate their minds. Chemical pesticides of course have significant effects in preventing and controlling pests and diseases, but believing that only chemical pesticides can solve the problem is a kind of superstition, and this superstition must be broken. Leaders must lead farmers to manufacture indigenous medicines, and then combine them with the continued supply of chemical pesticides for reasonable use.

    除治病虫害找到新途径
    利用野生植物制成土农药杀虫效果很好
    本报讯　为了保证农作物健壮生长，力争大丰收，各地农民使用土法土药和国家供应的大量化学农药向病虫害展开了积极的斗争。
    防治农作物病虫害的战斗早就开始了。各地领导机关根据去冬气候温暖越冬害虫死亡率低，今年病虫害要提早发生的特点，早就部署了防治病虫害的工作；在大跃进中干劲十足的广大农民也都作了准备。因此，田间病虫害刚一发生就投入了战斗。在4、5月间，各小麦产区，对麦蜘蛛、小麦吸浆虫和小麦秆锈病的战斗已经获得了胜利，保证了小麦丰收。从5月中下旬以来，南方部分水田地区向稻螟虫、稻飞虱、浮尘子和稻瘟病展开了围攻；各产棉区相继展开了防治棉蚜的战役，目前，主要棉区已比往年提前十天左右普遍治了一遍棉蚜；河北、河南、山东、江苏和安徽等省的蝗区，对蝗蝻围剿的结果，主要蝗区的夏蝗主力已被歼灭，使夏蝗未能起飞。
    很多地区破除迷信，依靠群众，广泛的使用土法土药。土法土药和化学农药一齐使用，是今年防治病虫害的主要特点之一，也是几个月来防治病虫获得重大成绩的重要原因。今年，由于病虫害发生的范围较广、较早，各地都出现了农药供不应求的现象，为了解决这个问题，很多地区的领导机关，总结群众利用土法土药的经验加以推广，并且发动群众大胆的想，大胆的干，依靠自己的智慧，战胜病虫灾害。结果，几十种土法土药被发掘出来了，大量推广使用以后，获得了显著的成效。例如，安徽省在防治小麦秆锈病时，除使用化学农药外，使用土法土药防治的面积就占42％，效果很好。河南省郸城县已经贮备了几十万斤土药，可供全县八万五千多亩棉田治蚜两遍之用，根本上解决了农药不足的困难。
    各地从群众中来的土法土药，最突出的是大量的利用了草本的或木本的野生植物。湖南省平江县的农民、医生、草药郎中等提供的十八种土药都是利用野生植物制造的，它们是：黄藤、蒿桐青、大黄花、杨梅树皮、毒大蒜、马条、法夏子、毒苍子、血当归、山漆、千斤拔等等。贵州省思南县、四川省三台县等地都利用几十种野生植物制成了土药。这些土药就地取材，制法简单，不须花钱或成本很低，治虫效果显著，因此，大受农民欢迎，一经提倡，就迅速地推广。此外，还有些地区供销部门的职工，为了解决急需的农药品类不足或从根本上做到农药自给，以敢想敢干的精神，经过钻研，用土办法改制了化学农药，或者试验成功了用土法制成化学农药的办法。四川省奉节县供销社的职工经过研究，就自己能够制造硫酸铜、蛋油乳剂、石灰硫磺合剂、棉油皂和松脂合剂等农药。目前，这个县的供销部门已建立九个制药厂，把制药办法传授给农民以后，农业社也建立了三十个制药厂，这样，农药不足的问题，便基本上获得了解决。
    采用土法土药防治病虫害的作物，特别是利用野生植物制药治虫，受到了中央有关部门的重视。有关部门负责人认为：这是一个方向，也是解决当前农药不足的重要途径，因此，要求各地重视起来，加以推广。在6、7、8三个月中，正是稻螟虫、稻苞虫、稻瘟病和棉蚜虫、棉铃虫以及粘虫、玉米螟、马铃薯晚疫病等病虫害相继盛发时期，农药需要量还会增加，在货源不足的情况下，各地有关部门必须立即扭转眼睛向上单纯依赖供应的观点，应该立即面向群众，总结群众利用土药土法的经验加以推广。有关部门负责人认为，能否广泛利用土药土法的关键，在于能不能解放思想。化学农药在防治病虫害上当然有显著的作用，但是认为只有化学农药才解决问题就是一种迷信，必须破除这种迷信，领导农民制造土药，再和继续供应的化学农药配搭起来，合理使用。
