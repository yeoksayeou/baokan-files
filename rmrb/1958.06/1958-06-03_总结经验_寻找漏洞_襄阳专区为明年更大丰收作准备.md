This newspaper reports: The Xiangyang Special District in Hubei Province, which has achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year, is seeing millions of farmers and workers joyfully and busily harvesting wheat while actively preparing for winter sowing, laying a solid foundation for striving for an even greater summer harvest next year.

As early as more than a month before the wheat harvest, the counties, townships, and communes in Xiangyang Special District organized cadres and the masses to visit and assess the wheat fields on the ground, summarizing high-yield experiences and identifying shortcomings. They overcame conservative thinking and studied winter sowing measures for this year. Some cadres in Zaoyang County originally believed that the county had many upland areas, making comprehensive and high-yield harvests impossible. By summarizing the field inspections, they identified typical examples of high yields in upland areas, thus refuting this view. Xiangyang County, where summer grain crops doubled this year compared to last year, conducted on-the-spot investigations and research in the fields at the end of April, led by the First Secretary of the County Party Committee along with the secretaries of various district committees. They concluded that it was entirely possible for summer grain crops next year to double again compared to this year. Gucheng County, renowned for achieving large-scale balanced yield increases in wheat, focused on summarizing the high-yield experience of wheat yielding more than 1,500 jin per mu in different areas throughout the county; it also conducted research on the problem of wheat lodging, identifying the causes and preventive measures. Zhuxi County, located in a large mountainous area, discovered more than ten wheat "thousand-jin communes" during the summary evaluation, breaking the conservative thinking that large-scale wheat production could not be achieved in mountainous areas.

In summarizing their experiences, all localities unanimously agreed that in order to achieve a large-scale bumper wheat harvest next year, it is imperative to earnestly implement yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, strip planting, close planting, uniform sowing, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and timely sowing during this year's winter sowing. To ensure the large-scale promotion of wide-row strip planting, cross strip planting, and equidistant strip planting, various localities have begun manufacturing roller seeders and ordering and transporting ten-row seeders. In the five counties of Xiangyang, Guanghua, and Gucheng alone, 80,000 ten-row seeders have already been purchased or ordered. The Xiangyang County Farm Implement Factory is modifying the purchased ten-row seeders according to the different row spacing requirements of upland and river areas. After determining that a 7-inch sowing width was appropriate for wide-row strip planting, Gucheng County mass-produced seeders according to this specification. To achieve deep plowing, various counties are also further promoting double-wheeled double-bottom plows. All 200,000 mu of wheat in the river area of Yicheng will be plowed using double-bottom plows. Guanghua County is currently conducting "five modifications" on its existing 1,000-plus double-bottom plows and plans to install double-bottom plowshares on all 2,000 old plows. In all winter sowing preparations, all localities have paid attention to the preparation of winter sowing fertilizer and seed selection. The entire special district's 7,800-plus agricultural cooperatives have newly built tens of thousands of field manure pits. Some counties have one large manure pit for every 20 to 30 mu of land. During the wheat harvest, many cooperatives designated seed-retaining plots and conducted block selection or ear selection.

### 总结经验  寻找漏洞  襄阳专区为明年更大丰收作准备

　　总结经验  寻找漏洞
    襄阳专区为明年更大丰收作准备
    本报讯  今年小麦获得大丰收的湖北省襄阳专区，数百万农民、工人在满怀喜悦紧张地进行麦收同时，积极进行冬播准备工作，为争取明年夏季更大丰收打下好基础。
    早在麦收前一个多月，襄阳专区各县、乡、社便组织干部和群众到麦田里实地参观鉴定，总结高产经验，寻找漏洞。克服保守思想，研究今年冬播措施。枣阳县有些干部原来认为这个县岗地多，不可能做到全面高额丰收。通过田间检查总结，找出岗地丰产典型，便否定了这种看法。今年夏收作物在去年基础上翻了一翻的襄阳县，在4月底由县委第一书记率领各区委书记在田间实地调查研究后，得出了明年夏收作物完全可能比今年再翻一翻的结论。以获得小麦大面积平衡增产著名的谷城县，着重总结了全县不同地区亩产一千五百斤以上的小麦高产经验；并对小麦的倒伏问题进行了研究，找出原因和预防办法。位于大山区的竹溪县，在总结评比中发现了十多个小麦千斤社，打破了山区小麦不能大面积丰产的保守思想。
    各地在总结经验中，一致认为：若要明年小麦大面积丰收，必须在今年冬播中，认真贯彻深耕、条播、密植、匀播、施足底肥和适时播种等增产措施。为了保证大面积推广宽幅条播、交叉条播和等距条播，各地已在着手制造滚播器，订购、赶运十行播种机，仅襄阳、光化、谷城等五个县，已买回或定购了的十行播种机有八万部。襄阳县农具厂，正根据岗地和河地的不同行距，把已买回的十行播种机进行改装。谷城县确定宽幅条播播幅以七寸为宜后，就根据这个规格大量生产。为了达到深耕，各县也都进一步地推广双轮双铧犁。宜城河地二十万亩小麦要全部用双铧犁犁。光化县正对现有的一千多部双铧犁进行“五改”，并准备把二千部旧犁全部安上双铧犁犁面。在各项冬播准备中，各地都注意了冬播肥料的准备和选种。全专区七千八百多个农业社新修的田头粪坑数以十万计。有的县达到二十到三十亩地有一个大粪坑。在麦收中许多合作社都确定了留种地，进行块选或穗选。
