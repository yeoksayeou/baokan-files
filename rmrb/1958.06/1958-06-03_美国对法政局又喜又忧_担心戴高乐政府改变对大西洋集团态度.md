Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 2nd: The White House issued a statement after the French National Assembly authorized De Gaulle to form a cabinet, saying that the United States was "very pleased" that the French crisis was "gradually being resolved," and that the United States "expects" the "close and friendly relations that have always existed in the long-term association" between the United States and France to continue.

According to American news agencies, American officials felt a mixture of relief, hope, and anxiety upon hearing that the National Assembly had voted to bring De Gaulle to power. Some officials said that the United States still does not know De Gaulle's attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European "integration." However, they were encouraged to see that three figures who are enthusiastic advocates of France's continued participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and support for European "integration" are important cabinet members in De Gaulle's cabinet. These three people refer to the Socialist Mollet, De Gaulle's predecessor Pflimlin, and the Independent Party's Pinay.

Defense Secretary McElroy said that he believes De Gaulle's rule in France "will be beneficial" to the United States' efforts to strengthen West German defense. At the same time, he also stated that because France has an important military position in the Atlantic Group, the United States will "very carefully" watch any actions taken by the De Gaulle government toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　美国对法政局又喜又忧
    担心戴高乐政府改变对大西洋集团态度
    据新华社2日讯  华盛顿消息：白宫在法国国民议会授权戴高乐组阁后发表声明说，美国因为法国危机“正在逐渐获得解决”感到“很高兴”，美国“期望”美国同法国的“长期结合中一向存在的亲密友好关系会继续下去”。
    据美国通讯社指出，美国官员们在听到国民议会表决戴高乐上台后的心情是：松了一口气，怀着希望同时又掺杂着忧虑。一些官员说，美国到今天还不确知戴高乐对北大西洋公约组织和欧洲“整体化”的态度。但是，看到有三个热心主张法国继续参加北大西洋公约组织和拥护欧洲“整体化”的人物是戴高乐内阁中的重要阁员，他们就振奋起来了。这三个人指的是社会党的摩勒、戴高乐的前任弗林姆兰和独立党的比内。
    国防部长麦克耳罗伊说，他相信戴高乐在法国执政对美国加强西德防御的努力“将是有利的”。但同时他又表示，由于法国在大西洋集团中具有重要的军事地位，美国将“非常关切地”注视戴高乐政府对北大西洋公约组织采取的任何行动。
