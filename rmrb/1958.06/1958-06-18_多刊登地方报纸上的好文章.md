    Publish More Good Articles from Local Newspapers
    After reading the abstract of the Hebei Daily's May 31st editorial "Is the Drive Sufficient?" which was reprinted in the People's Daily on June 5th, I felt that this article was very good. This article closely links the theory of materialist dialectics with the most practical current issues. It tells us that "exerting full effort and striving for the top" is endless, and if we want to stand at the forefront of history and always maintain the glory of being advanced, we must first always maintain vigorous revolutionary drive, continuously innovate technology and improve work, and push science and technology to infinite peaks.
    We do not have the means to read newspapers from all over the country, but we hope to gain more enlightenment from the newspaper. In order to solve this contradiction, I sincerely hope that the People's Daily will publish as many abstracts or full texts of excellent articles from local newspapers as possible.

    多刊登地方报纸上的好文章
    读了6月5日人民日报转载的河北日报5月31日的社论“干劲鼓足了吗？”的摘要，感到这篇文章很好。这篇文章把唯物辩证法的理论和当前最实际的问题紧紧地联系起来了。它告诉我们：“鼓足干劲，力争上游”是无止境的，我们要站在历史的前面和永远保持先进者的光荣，首先应该永远保持旺盛的革命干劲，不断地革新技术和改进工作，把科学与技术推向无限的高峰。
    我们没有条件阅读各地报纸，但希望从报纸上获得更多的教益。为了解决这个矛盾，非常希望人民日报尽可能多刊登一些地方报纸上优秀篇章的摘要或全文。
