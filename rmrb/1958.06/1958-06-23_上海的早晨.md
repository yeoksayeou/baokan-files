    "Shanghai Morning"
    Zhou Erfu's novel mainly reflects the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and bourgeois elements under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class. It also reflects the process of the continuous growth and development of the Chinese working class. Through this, it reflects the historically significant and profound changes in our country's transition from bourgeois democratic revolution to socialist revolution.
    The book consists of four parts. The first part was published in "Harvest" and has now been published as a separate edition by the Writers Publishing House. (Jing)
