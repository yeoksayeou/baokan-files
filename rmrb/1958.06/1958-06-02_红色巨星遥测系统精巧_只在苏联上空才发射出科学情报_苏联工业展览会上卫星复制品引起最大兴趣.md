Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st – The three full-scale replicas of Soviet artificial satellites displayed at the 1958 Soviet Industrial Exhibition, which opened today, attracted tremendous interest.

On this day, before the exhibition was even declared open, crowds of people were already standing in front of the "Science Pavilion," waiting to visit. As soon as the doors opened, the crowds surged into the pavilion, vying to see the three dazzling satellites. Although the first satellite was much smaller in size than the second and third satellites, against the backdrop of the blue sky, it appeared like a petrel flapping its wings, ready to take flight. The second satellite was a huge cone, and people could clearly see where the dog Laika had lived and where the instruments were placed.

The most eye-catching was the replica of the third artificial satellite. It was placed on a pedestal in the center of the "Science Pavilion" hall, visible from all sides. The third satellite was a huge cone shimmering with silver light. The cone-shaped fairing on top of it was even larger than the second satellite. The exhibition guide told everyone that in terms of carrying capacity, this satellite could hold a Victory car.

This satellite was equipped with many antennas of different lengths and shapes. One of them was used to transmit radio signals, which could be received by all radio stations on Earth, and the other antennas were used to transmit scientific information. According to the guide, the satellite was equipped with a telemetry system used to record and "memorize" the results of high-altitude observations. Each time the satellite passed over Soviet territory, a programmed timer would connect the telemetry system and the radio transmitter, and the transmitter would then send scientific information to various Soviet scientific stations. When the satellite flew outside Soviet territory, the transmitter would stop working. This was done partly to save electricity and partly because only the Soviet Union possessed the equipment to receive and decipher these radio codes. The guide emphasized that this equipment was extremely complex and valuable, and other countries were far from being able to manufacture it at present.

The front of the third satellite was equipped with various instruments, which were very delicate and small in size, while the rear was equipped with sensors for recording micrometeorites and solar batteries, four of which were specifically for the needs of the radio transmitter.

The satellite's antennas were made of steel, and its outer shell was made of aluminum alloy. We saw that in several places on the outer shell, aluminum plates opened and closed like small windows, which were used to adjust the temperature of the instruments.

The exhibition hall also displayed the first liquid-fueled rocket launched by the Soviet Union in 1933, which was about two and a half meters long. In addition, it also displayed a model of the world's first rocket glider, flown by pilot Fedorov in 1940.

The exhibits at the exhibition showed that the Soviet Union had already developed a liquid-fueled rocket engine as early as 1930, began using rockets to study the upper atmosphere in 1949, and launched rockets carrying animals for high-altitude experiments in 1951. These exhibits aroused great interest.

### 红色巨星遥测系统精巧  只在苏联上空才发射出科学情报  苏联工业展览会上卫星复制品引起最大兴趣

　　红色巨星遥测系统精巧
    只在苏联上空才发射出科学情报
    苏联工业展览会上卫星复制品引起最大兴趣
    新华社莫斯科31日电　陈列在今天开幕的1958年苏联工业展览会中的三个苏联人造卫星全真复制品吸引了人们巨大的兴趣。
    这天，在展览会还未宣告开幕之前，展览会“科学馆”门前早就站着一队队等候参观的人群了。大门一开，人群便涌入馆内，争看三个辉煌夺目的卫星。第一个卫星的体积比起第二、第三个卫星虽然小得多，但在蓝天背景的衬托下，却显得好像一只振翼欲飞的海燕，就要凌空飞去。第二个卫星是一个巨大的圆锥体，人们可以清楚地看到小狗莱伊卡居住过和放置仪器的地方。
    最惹人注目的是第三个人造卫星的复制品。它被安放在“科学馆”大厅中央的一个台座上，四方八面都可看到它。第三个卫星是一个闪耀着银色光辉的庞大圆锥体。装在它顶部的圆锥形护套比第二个卫星还要大。展览会讲解员对大家说，就载重量而言，这个卫星足可以装进一部胜利牌汽车。
    这个卫星装有很多根长度、形状不同的天线。其中有一根是用来发射无线电讯号的，地球上所有无线电台都可以收到它，其余的天线则用来发射科学情报。据讲解员说，卫星上装有用来记录和“记忆”高空考察结果的遥测系统，当卫星每次经过苏联上空的时候，程序时间装置就把遥测系统和无线电发射机接通，发射机于是就向苏联各个科学站发出科学情报，当卫星飞出苏联上空之外的时候，发射机便停止工作。这样做一方面是为了节约电能，另一方面，也因为只有苏联才拥有接受和译解这些无线电密码的装置。讲解员强调说，这种装置是极为复杂和珍贵的，现在，别的国家还远没有能力制造这种装置。
    第三个卫星的前部装备着各种各样的仪器，这些仪器都很精巧、体积不大，后部则装有记录微流星的传感器和太阳能电池，其中有四个太阳能电池是专门供给无线电发射机的需要的。
    卫星的天线用钢制成，它的外壳则用铝合金制成。我们看到这个外壳有几处地方的铝板像小窗户一样一开一合，原来这是用来调节仪器温度的。
    展览馆还陈列着1933年苏联发射的、长约二公尺半的第一枝液体燃料火箭。此外，还陈列着于1940年由飞行员费多罗夫驾驶的，世界第一架火箭滑翔机的模型。
    展览会上的展品表明，苏联早在1930年就制成液体燃料火箭发动机，1949年开始用火箭研究大气高层，1951年便发射载有动物的火箭进行高空试验。这些展品都引起人们极大的兴趣。
