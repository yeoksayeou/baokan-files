Doing it Yourself is the Best Policy
Henan Province Comes up with Many Good Ideas

(By our reporter) After the widespread blooming of local industry in Henan Province, a common problem has been the lack of equipment. To overcome this difficulty, they put forward the battle cry of self-reliance and making industrial equipment themselves. Encouraged by this slogan, many enterprises throughout the province have come up with many good ideas.

　　Wooden Materials Made into Blowers
    Linru County sent people all over Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Hankou, Xi'an, Beijing and other places to buy blowers for iron smelting and cement production, but they couldn't buy them. Under the encouragement and support of the Party and the government, Wu Benshan and two other members of the Chengguan Wood Industry Cooperative decided to try to make a wooden blower to replace the blower. After a week of painstaking research, they finally succeeded in trial production on May 3.

    This blower is mostly made of wood, with a simple structure and low cost, and its effect is equivalent to a three-horsepower electric blower.

　　Firebrick Builds Hot Blast Stove
    The Maxshankou Iron Smelting Plant in Neixiang County invested 40,000 yuan and spent 40 days to build a small blast furnace with a capacity of eight cubic meters. They boldly used substitutes, using one ton of steel and fourteen tons of white pig iron instead of cast iron to cast hot blast pipes, rubber pipes instead of steel pipes to transport cooling water, wooden bellows instead of blowers, and the outer skin of the furnace and the hot blast stove were all built with firebricks.

    The original plan was to build this small blast furnace on an open space, but it was later changed to be built close to a loess cliff, saving feeding machines, inclined ladders, feeding platforms, water towers, etc., which could save more than 40,000 yuan in investment.

　　Self-Made Cement Equipment is Good and Saves Money
    The Wuliang Township Party Committee in Yu County, relying on the wisdom of the masses in developing the cement industry, created an automatic suction vertical furnace and a double-roller quick mill, which solved the difficulties of not having a blower, pulverizer, or a number 130 fine sieve, greatly improving the output and quality of cement and reducing costs. The investment is small, the returns are quick, and the operation is easy. The cost of establishing an automatic suction vertical furnace and a double-roller quick mill is only more than 60 yuan per ton of cement. It is expected that after mass production, it can be further reduced to about 36 yuan; while the cost of cement produced by general indigenous methods is as high as more than 80 yuan per ton.

    In late May, the Henan Provincial Department of Industry held a cement industry conference in this township to promote their experience.

### 自己动手是上上策  河南省想出许多好办法

　　自己动手是上上策
    河南省想出许多好办法
    本报讯　河南省地方工业普遍开花以后，设备不足是普遍性的问题。为了克服这个困难，他们提出了自力更生、自己动手制造工业设备的战斗口号。在这个口号的鼓舞下，全省不少企业想出了许许多多的好办法。
    木料制成鼓风机
    临汝县为了买炼铁和生产水泥的鼓风机，曾派人跑遍上海、天津、沈阳、汉口、西安、北京等地，都没买到。在党和政府的鼓励和支持下，城关木业社社员吴本善等三人，决心试制木制鼓风炉代替鼓风机，经过一个星期的苦心钻研，终于5月3日试制成功。
    这部鼓风炉大部是木制的，构造简单，成本低廉，效果相当于三马力的电动鼓风机。
    青砖砌起热风炉
    内乡县马山口炼铁厂用四万元投资，四十天时间，建成一座八立方公尺的小高炉。他们大胆使用代用品，用一吨钢材、十四吨白口铁代替铸造生铁铸造热风管，胶皮管代替钢管输送冷却水，木风箱代替鼓风机，炉外皮及热风炉都用青砖围砌。
    这座小高炉原计划建在空场上，后来改成紧靠黄土陡崖修建，省去了送料机、斜梯、送料台、水塔等，共可节省投资四万多元。
    自造水泥设备又好又省
    禹县无梁乡党委会，在发展水泥工业中依靠群众智慧，创造了自动吸风立炉和双磙快碾，解决了没有鼓风机、粉碎机及一百三十号细罗的困难，大大提高了水泥的产量与质量，降低了成本，而且投资少、收效快、操作容易。建立一座自动吸风立炉和一部双磙快碾，每吨水泥成本只合六十多元，预计大量投入生产后，可进一步降到三十六元左右；而一般土法生产的水泥高达八十多元一吨。
    5月下旬，河南省工业厅在这个乡召开了水泥工业会议，推广了他们的经验。
