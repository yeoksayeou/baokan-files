(This article was transmitted by our reporter in Hohhot) The Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Hohhot from May 29 to June 4. The meeting conveyed and earnestly discussed the various reports and resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and finally made a resolution on implementing the general line of socialist construction.

During the discussion, the attending committee members, league committee secretaries, and heads of various departments cited a large number of facts from various aspects such as large-scale water conservancy construction, massive accumulation of fertilizer, large-scale industry, improvement of agricultural tools, early cooperation in animal husbandry, afforestation and greening, and elimination of illiteracy to prove the correctness of the general line of socialist construction. As long as we follow this general line, the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will soon be completely changed. During the discussion, everyone believed that the lesson of the saddle shape mentioned by Comrade Shaoqi in his report also conformed to the situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The meeting particularly emphasized that lessons must be learned from the saddle shape, and in the future, we must closely connect with the masses, connect with reality, and thoroughly follow the mass line. The meeting called on every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre to plant red flags on their own ideological fronts. Only in this way can we better implement the general line.

Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that in order to correctly implement the general line, it is necessary to launch a heat wave of studying Mao Zedong Thought, especially leading cadres at all levels must systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding Marxist of our time. Historical facts have proved that those who listen to Chairman Mao are right. To emphasize the present over the past means mainly studying the works and thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong. He said that those who lack this lesson must make up for it, and those who have not studied deeply and thoroughly in the past must study deeply and thoroughly this time.

The meeting finally made a resolution on how to implement the general line of socialist construction. The resolution said that it is necessary to immediately organize cadres throughout the region to study the general line, and to organize 100,000 cadres to go deep into the grassroots to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. Through the publicity of the general line, a greater upsurge of production and construction and cultural construction will be launched. In addition, the resolution also made specific instructions on how to concentrate greater strength on socialist construction while continuing to strive for a complete victory in the rectification campaign, how to lead the current movement for reform of production tools in rural and pastoral areas and the technical innovation movement in industrial and mining enterprises, studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and studying dialectical materialism.

    内蒙古自治区党委扩大会议号召
    认真学习毛主席著作  在思想阵地上插红旗
    本报呼和浩特电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会全体委员会议（扩大），从5月29日到6月4日在呼和浩特举行。会议传达并认真讨论了中共八大二次会议各项报告和决议，最后作出关于贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的决议。
    讨论中，到会的委员、盟委书记和各部门负责人，从大修水利、大量积肥、大办工业、改良农具、牧业提前合作化、造林绿化、扫除文盲等各个方面列举大量事实，来证明社会主义建设总路线的正确性。只要遵循这条总路线前进，内蒙古自治区的面貌就将很快完全改观。在讨论中，大家认为少奇同志在报告中所说的马鞍形的教训，也符合内蒙古自治区的情况。会议特别强调，要从马鞍形中得到教训，今后必须密切联系群众，联系实际，彻底走群众路线。会议号召每一个共产党员和革命干部，都要在自己的思想阵地上插红旗。只有这样，才能更好地贯彻执行总路线。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫在会上讲了话。他说，为了正确贯彻执行总路线，必须掀起一个学习毛泽东思想的热潮，特别是各级党的领导干部必须系统地学习毛泽东同志的著作。毛泽东同志是当代的杰出的马克思主义者。历史事实证明，凡是听毛主席话的，都对了，厚今薄古，主要就是学习毛泽东同志的著作和思想。他说，凡缺这一课的必须补上，过去学得不深不透的这次要学深学透。
    会议最后就如何贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线问题作出决议。决议说，要立即组织全区干部学习总路线，并且组织十万干部深入基层组织传达“八大”二次会议的精神。通过总路线的宣传，掀起一个更大的生产建设和文化建设高潮。此外，决议对在继续争取整风全胜的同时，如何集中更大力量进行社会主义建设、如何领导当前农村牧区的生产工具改革运动和工矿企业的技术革新运动、学习马列主义和毛泽东同志的著作以及学习唯物辩证法等问题，也作了具体指示。
