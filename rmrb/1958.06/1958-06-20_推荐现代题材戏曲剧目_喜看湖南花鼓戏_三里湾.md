Recommending Modern Theme Opera

A Joyful Look at the Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan"

Hu Sha

The Hunan Flower Drum Opera Troupe has achieved great success by creatively adapting and performing Comrade Zhao Shuli's "Sanliwan." During the performance, the theater was filled with a lively and joyous atmosphere.

Why do I feel particularly sensitive to the originality of this play by the Flower Drum Opera Troupe? Probably because I participated in the directing of the Pingju opera "Sanliwan." When I saw the Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan," I was particularly pleased to see that the scriptwriting, directing, and characterization were different from the Pingju opera, yet each had its own characteristics and merits. Because we can learn many good things from the Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan."

If we compare Zhao Shuli's novel of the same name to a mirror, it can be said to be a large mirror. It reflects the faces of many characters in the rural cooperative movement. These diverse characters did many things, and a lively and interesting struggle unfolded between them, which, in summary, is a struggle between two lines. The Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan" skillfully brought the complicated stories of the novel to the stage and vividly expressed this struggle.

The director skillfully used and developed the traditional expressive forms of Flower Drum Opera. Anyone who has seen "Liu Hai Chopping Wood" knows that traditional Hunan Flower Drum Opera is known for its singing and dancing. However, because "Sanliwan" has many characters, complicated threads, sharp conflicts, and a long story, pure singing and dancing are not enough to express it. The director inherited the traditional Flower Drum Opera's technique of expressing folk life comedy to deal with this play, and paid great attention to the characterization of the characters in the play, so that it matched the appearance of the new characters in the new countryside. Because the director and actors have made efforts in both of these aspects, the play has both the bright, concise, and exaggerated techniques of opera, and a strong color of new life.

Many characters in this play are performed very well, such as Zhang Leyi, Hutu Tu, Chang Youli, Fan Denggao, Yuan Tiancheng, etc. The outlines of these characters are relatively clear. These belong to the older generation or middle-aged people in the play. There are also a large number of young people in the play. For example, the League branch secretary Fan Lingzhi, League members Wang Yumei, Ma Youyi, Wang Yusheng, militiaman Wang Manxi, Yuan Xiaojun, etc., are even more energetic in their performances, leaving a deep impression on the audience. In particular, Wang Yusheng played by Jiang Xiaohu, Wang Manxi played by Zhang Jianjun, and Wang Yumei played by Gong Guyin can be said to have created quite complete images of rural youth. Their performances are constantly developing with the development of the plot, and the levels are relatively clear. It is especially valuable that their inner emotions and external actions are closely combined. For example, in the two scenes where Lingzhi proposes to Yusheng and Manxi and Xiaojun get along well, Yusheng and Manxi's performances are very moving. The audience seemed to hear their hearts beating.

In order to make this play even better, I would like to offer a few immature opinions for the reference of the comrades of the Hunan Flower Drum Opera Troupe. From the script point of view, it seems that the first few scenes are not as good as the later ones. I feel that the beginning is not clear enough. Some scenes can be handled more beautifully, such as the scene where Manxi is sleeping, with two bare feet facing the audience, and Yusheng tickling his feet, but another way can actually be used to express this. Furthermore, Fan Denggao's transformation, Zhang Leyi taking out a piece of broken clothing worn by Fan for three generations to enlighten Fan's awakening, does not seem natural enough. According to the current script structure of the Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan," is it more appropriate to delete this paragraph and express Fan Denggao according to the attitude of the original work?

    推荐现代题材戏曲剧目
    喜看湖南花鼓戏“三里湾”
    胡沙
    湖南省花鼓戏剧团以自己的独创性编演了赵树理同志的“三里湾”，得到了很大的成功。演出时，剧场充满了活泼和欢愉的空气。
    我为什么对于花鼓戏剧团这出戏的独创性特别感觉敏锐呢？大概因为我曾参加过评剧“三里湾”的导演工作。当我看到湖南花鼓戏“三里湾”，从剧本编写，导演处理，人物刻划都和评剧不相同，又各有特色和妙处时，我感到格外的喜欢。因为我们可以从花鼓戏“三里湾”中，学习到许多好东西。
    如果我们将赵树理的这部同名小说比作一面镜子，可以说是一面大镜子。它照出了农村合作化运动中许多人物的面貌。这些形形色色的人物做了许多事情，他们之间又展开了生动活泼趣味横生的斗争，总起来说，就是两条路线的斗争。花鼓戏“三里湾”将小说中头绪纷繁的故事巧妙的搬上了舞台，并且鲜明的表现了这个斗争。
    导演熟练的运用和发展了花鼓戏传统的表现形式。看过“刘海砍樵”的人都知道，传统的湖南花鼓是以表现歌舞见长的。由于“三里湾”中的人物多，头绪繁，斗争尖锐，故事长，纯用歌舞形式就不足以表现了。导演继承了传统花鼓戏表现民间生活喜剧的手法来处理这出戏，并且十分注意剧中人物形象的刻划，使他和新农村的新人物的面貌相吻合。由于导演和演员在这两方面都作了努力，使这出戏既具有戏曲的明快、简捷、夸张的手法，又具有浓厚的新的生活的色彩。
    这出戏中的许多人物都演得很好，比方张乐意、糊涂涂、常有理、范登高、袁天成等，这些人物的轮廓都较鲜明。这是属于剧中的老一辈的人或中年人。剧中还有一大批青年人。如团支书范灵芝，团员王玉梅，马有翼，王玉生，民兵王满喜，袁小俊等，更是表演得生气勃勃，给观众留下了深刻的记忆。特别是蒋啸虎扮演的王玉生，张建军扮演的王满喜，龚谷音扮演的王玉梅，可以说是创造得相当完整的农村青年的形象。他们的表演，随着剧情的发展不断的发展着，层次较鲜明。特别可贵的是，他们的内在情绪和外部动作结合的紧凑。比方灵芝向玉生求爱及满喜和小俊相好的两个场面中，玉生和满喜的表演是十分动人的。观众好像听见了他们的心的跳动。
    为了使这出戏加工得更好，我想提几点不成熟的意见，供湖南花鼓戏剧团的同志们参考。从剧本上说，似乎头几场不如后面的好，我感觉开头的头绪不够清楚。有些场面的处理，还可以美一些，如满喜睡觉那场，露出两支赤脚冲着观众，玉生又搔他的脚心，其实可以换一个别的方式来表现。再就是范登高的转变，张乐意拿出范的一件三代穿过的破衣，来启发范的觉悟，好似也不够自然，根据花鼓戏“三里湾”目前的剧本结构来看，删去这一段，按照原作的态度来表现范登高，是否更合适？
