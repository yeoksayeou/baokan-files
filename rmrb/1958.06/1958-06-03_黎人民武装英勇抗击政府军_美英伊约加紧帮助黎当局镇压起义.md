Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 2nd: The Lebanese people's struggle against the pro-Western ruling clique has continued for nearly four weeks. In various places, the insurgent people are valiantly fighting back against the brutal attacks of government troops supported by imperialism.

Large-scale clashes have occurred between insurgents and government forces in the Tripoli area in the past two days. The insurgents' positions in this area have been subjected to intense artillery fire.

According to the "Voice of Free Lebanon Radio" broadcast on the evening of June 1, government troops attacked Hasbaya, southeast of Sidon, and Beit El Dine, southeast of Beirut. Most of the city of Sidon remains in the hands of the insurgents.

Imperialists, led by the United States, are intensifying their intervention activities.

According to the "Today's News" report, another US aircraft of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Air Force arrived in Beirut on June 1, carrying a large amount of ammunition. The Lebanese authorities immediately distributed this ammunition to the members of the National Socialist Party.

According to newspapers, Glubb Pasha, the former British commander of the Arab Legion, arrived in Beirut on June 1 and was received by Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. The newspapers said that Glubb was formally commissioned by the British government to come to Lebanon to implement a plan to suppress the Lebanese people's uprising.

"Today's News" also reported that a group of Iraqi troops had been airlifted to Lebanon to participate in the suppression of the insurgent people. More than 1,000 Iraqi officers and soldiers have arrived in Lebanon in the past two weeks.

According to the "Al Anwar" report on June 2, Jordanian Commander-in-Chief Haza'a al-Majali, Director of Military Intelligence Mohammed Sadi, and other Jordanian officials decided at a meeting on June 1 to send "volunteers" to Lebanon to help suppress the people's uprising. The newspaper said that each "volunteer" would be prepaid three months' salary and issued a Lebanese identity card.

    据新华社大马士革2日电  黎巴嫩人民反对亲西方统治集团的斗争已经持续了将近四个星期，各地起义人民在英勇还击在帝国主义支援下的政府部队的残暴进攻。

    据“自由黎巴嫩之声电台”1日晚间广播，政府部队袭击了赛伊达东南的哈斯贝亚和贝鲁特东南的贝特丁。赛伊达城市的大部分仍旧掌握在起义者手中。
    以美国为首的帝国主义者仍在加紧它们的干涉活动。
    据“今天报”报道，又有一架北大西洋公约组织空军的美国飞机在1日载着大批军火到达贝鲁特。黎巴嫩当局立即把这些军火分发给国家社会党党徒。
    据报纸透露，前阿拉伯军团英国司令格拉布在1日抵达贝鲁特，并且受到黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的接见。报纸说，格拉布受英国政府正式委命前来黎巴嫩执行镇压黎巴嫩人民起义的计划。
    “今天报”还报道，一批伊拉克军队已经空运到黎巴嫩，参加镇压起义人民。近两周来已经有一千多名伊拉克官兵来到了黎巴嫩。
    据“光明报”2日报道，约旦总司令哈扎·马加利和陆军情报处处长穆罕默德·萨迪以及其他约旦官员在1日举行的一次会议上决定派“志愿军”到黎巴嫩去帮助镇压人民起义。报纸说，对每一名“志愿人员”都将预付三个月的薪金，并且将发给他们黎巴嫩的身份证。
