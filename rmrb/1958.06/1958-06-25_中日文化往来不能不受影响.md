    Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchanges Cannot Be Unaffected
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people has aroused boundless indignation among the Chinese people and has also met with resolute opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people and people of integrity. In order to obscure the vision of the Japanese people and extricate itself from its predicament, the Kishi Nobusuke government is playing new tricks. It is trying its best to spread the idea that the Chinese people have "misunderstood" the Chinese flag incident in Nagasaki; in order to eliminate this "misunderstanding," "mutual understanding" should be "enhanced through cultural exchanges between the two peoples." The Kishi Nobusuke government attempts to use the word "misunderstanding" to lightly gloss over its hostility and insult to the Chinese people, and instead, turn around and blame the Chinese people, who are being subjected to hostility and insult, for the deterioration of relations between China and Japan. Not only that, the Kishi Nobusuke government is also trying its best to pretend that it is really concerned about Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, so as to more insidiously deceive the Japanese people and provoke friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan.
    It is true that developing friendly cultural exchanges is the common desire of the peoples of China and Japan. Since the Kishi Nobusuke government destroyed the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and condoned the rioters' insult to our national flag in Nagasaki, causing the interruption of Sino-Japanese economic exchanges, many people in Japan have indeed been worried: Will the friendly cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan be affected? Is it possible that the joint efforts made by the peoples of China and Japan since the founding of New China to promote mutual understanding and friendly exchanges will be destroyed by the Kishi Nobusuke government? The Kishi Nobusuke government has seized on this point and deliberately released a smokescreen of so-called cultural exchanges in an attempt to continue to play its double-dealing tricks. The Kishi Nobusuke government's wishful thinking is: if cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan can continue as usual without changing the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, it can say that this is a sign of weakness on the part of the Chinese people, and more stubbornly adhere to its reactionary anti-China policy; if cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan are affected as a result, it can blame the Chinese people and use this to arouse dissatisfaction among the Japanese people towards China.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government should be warned that this kind of conspiracy is futile. It can neither deceive the Japanese people nor fool the Chinese people. The Japanese people and those in Japan who have a little rationality will recognize from the facts of the past nine years that the Chinese people have always cherished the desire for friendly exchanges with the Japanese people and have done their best in this regard. They will realize that the Chinese people have in the past and still do today distinguish between militarists such as Kishi Nobusuke and the broad masses of the Japanese people, as well as those who are willing to get along with China in a friendly manner. The Japanese calligraphy delegation and the Hanayagi Tokubei dance troupe, which recently paid friendly visits to our country, unanimously expressed their firm opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to be hostile to the Chinese people and play the "two Chinas" game, and expressed their hope to develop friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan and restore normal relations between China and Japan. The Chinese cultural and art circles still treat them as sincere friends as in the past and give them a warm reception, which is the best illustration. There is no so-called "misunderstanding" of the Japanese people by the Chinese people. There is also no "misunderstanding" of the Kishi Nobusuke government. The Chinese people have long seen through its latent imperialist ambitions and the ugly face of militarism. It is the Kishi Nobusuke government that is undermining and obstructing the friendly cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.
    However, it must be pointed out that unless the Kishi Nobusuke government fundamentally corrects its mistakes, continues to be hostile to the Chinese people, continues to create "two Chinas," and continues to obstruct the normalization of relations between China and Japan, the friendly cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan cannot but be seriously affected. The Kishi Nobusuke government's actions against the Chinese people in the past few months have seriously undermined the achievements made jointly by the peoples of China and Japan in friendly exchanges over the past few years. Under such circumstances, it is impossible for the Chinese people to maintain the past mode of communication under a more friendly atmosphere. If this is done, it will not only be of no benefit to the cause of cultural friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, but will also be used by Kishi Nobusuke as capital to deceive the Japanese people. Similarly, the Japanese people and all those who truly wish to carry out cultural friendly exchanges with the Chinese people cannot imagine that while carrying out cultural friendly exchanges with the Chinese people, they can tolerate the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people without waging a resolute struggle against it.
    This shows that in order to realize the desire to develop friendly cultural exchanges between each other, the peoples of China and Japan must wage a resolute struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to be hostile to the Chinese people, create "two Chinas," and obstruct the normalization of relations between China and Japan. We believe that Japanese friends will understand that carrying out this struggle is also to safeguard the vital interests of the Japanese people. Because if Kishi Nobusuke government's latent imperialist ambitions are allowed to succeed, it will first mean a new disaster for the Japanese people. The Chinese people have always despised imperialism. Thirteen years ago, under such historical conditions, the Chinese people were able to defeat Japanese militarism, which dared to invade China. Today, the great Chinese people who are vigorously advancing in the cause of building socialism will certainly not take a handful of Japanese militarists into their eyes. The Chinese people will always be reliable friends of the Japanese people in their struggle against American control and for democracy and peace. The Chinese people will always distinguish between friends and enemies at any time. We welcome friends like Mr. Hanayagi Tokubei. As for a two-faced and ill-intentioned person like Kishi Nobusuke, the Chinese people have always known how to treat them.

### 中日文化往来不能不受影响

    中日文化往来不能不受影响
    岸信介政府敌视中国人民的政策，引起了中国人民的无限愤慨，同时也遭到了日本广大人民和正直人士的坚决反对。岸信介政府为了模糊日本人民的视线和摆脱自己的困境，正在玩弄新的阴谋。它竭力散布这样的空气：中国人民对在长崎发生的中国国旗事件产生了“误解”；为了消除这一“误解”，应当“通过两国人民的文化交流”来“增进相互了解”。岸信介政府企图用“误解”这样的字眼，把它对中国人民的敌视和侮辱，轻描淡写地遮盖过去，并且反过来倒打一耙，把中日两国关系恶化的责任推到遭受敌视和侮辱的中国人民身上。不仅如此，岸信介政府还竭力想把自己装扮成好像真是关心中日文化交流的样子，以便更阴险地欺骗日本人民和挑拨中日两国人民的友好关系。
    不错，发展文化友好往来是中日两国人民的共同愿望。自从岸信介政府破坏中日第四次贸易协定，在长崎纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗，使中日经济往来中断以来，在日本人民中确实有不少人存在着这样的耽心：中日两国人民之间的文化友好往来是不是会受到影响呢？难道说从新中国成立以来，中日两国人民对于促进相互了解、友好往来的共同努力，就这样被岸信介政府毁于一旦吗？岸信介政府正是抓住了这一点故意放出所谓文化交流的烟幕来，企图继续玩弄它两面三刀的阴谋手法。岸信介政府的如意算盘是：如果在岸信介政府敌视中国人民的政策没有改变的情况下，中日两国人民的文化往来还可以照旧进行，它就可以把这说成是中国人民示弱的表现，并且更加顽固地坚持它的反动的对华政策；如果中日两国人民间的文化往来竟因此而受到影响，它就可以把责任推到中国人民身上，借此挑起日本人民对中国的不满。
    应当正告岸信介政府，这种阴谋是心劳日拙的，它既欺骗不了日本人民，更愚弄不了中国人民。日本人民和日本稍有理性的人士，都会从九年来的事实，认识到中国人民一直怀着同日本人民友好往来的愿望，并且在这一方面竭尽了自己的力量。他们会认识到中国人民过去和现在，都是把岸信介等军国主义分子同日本广大人民以至愿意同中国友好相处的人士区别开来对待的。最近来我国进行友好访问的日本书法代表团和花柳德兵卫舞蹈团一致表示他们坚决反对岸信介政府敌视中国人民、玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，希望发展中日两国人民间的友好往来和恢复中日两国的正常关系。中国的文化艺术界仍旧同过去一样，把他们当做真诚的朋友，并且给予热诚的接待，这就是最好的说明。中国人民对日本人民，并不存在所谓“误解”。就是对岸信介政府也不存在什么“误解”，中国人民早就看透了它的潜在的帝国主义野心和军国主义的丑恶面目。破坏和阻挠中日两国人民文化友好往来的，正是岸信介政府。
    但是必须指出，在岸信介政府没有根本改正它的错误，而且继续敌视中国人民，继续制造“两个中国”，继续阻挠中日两国关系正常化的情况下，中日两国人民间的文化友好往来不可能不受到严重的影响。岸信介政府几个月来对中国人民的所作所为，已经使中日两国人民几年来在友好往来方面共同努力所取得的成果，遭受到严重的破坏。中国人民不可能在这样的情况下，照旧维持过去在比较友好的气氛下的交往方式。如果这样做，那不但对中日两国人民文化友好的事业毫无利益，而且只会被岸信介利用来作为欺骗日本人民的资本。同样，日本人民和一切真正愿意同中国人民进行文化友好往来的人士，也不可能设想，一方面同中国人民进行文化友好往来，而另一方面却可以容忍岸信介政府敌视中国人民的政策，而毋须同它进行坚决的斗争。
    这就说明，中日两国人民为了要实现相互间发展文化友好往来的愿望，就必须同岸信介政府敌视中国人民、制造“两个中国”和阻挠中日两国关系正常化的阴谋进行坚决的斗争。我们相信，日本的朋友会懂得，进行这一斗争，也正是为了保卫日本人民的切身利益。因为如果让岸信介政府的这种潜在的帝国主义的野心一旦得逞，那就首先意味着日本人民的新的灾难。中国人民从来就是藐视帝国主义的。十三年前，在那样的历史条件下，中国人民就能够打败胆敢侵略中国的日本军国主义，今天正在建设社会主义的事业中奋勇跃进的伟大中国人民，当然更不会把一小撮日本军国主义分子看在眼下。中国人民将始终是日本人民在反对美国控制和争取民主、和平的斗争中的可靠朋友。中国人民在任何时候都会分清谁是朋友，谁是敌人。我们欢迎像花柳德兵卫先生这样的朋友。至于像岸信介这样一个两面三刀、不怀好意的人物，中国人民历来是懂得怎样对待他们的。
