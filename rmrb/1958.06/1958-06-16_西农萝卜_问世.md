    "Xinong Radish" is Born

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Electric Dispatch  Lecturer Li Hongyuan of Northwest Agricultural College, in close cooperation with vegetable farmers, has cultivated a new variety of radish, the "Xinong Radish," after several years of experimentation. This radish is sweet, can be eaten raw or cooked, has high water content, matures early, and has a high yield, making it very popular among farmers.

    In the winter of 1953, Li Hongyuan discovered naturally hybridized plants with huge roots in the Daqing radish field and the Wugong vegetable radish field of the teaching experimental farm. In the spring of 1954, he and the workers at the vegetable experiment station studied and planted these two naturally hybridized, superior individual plants together for hybridization. From 1954 to 1956, they strictly selected superior individual plants with huge roots for seed retention and strengthened cultivation each year. By 1956, the root shape was basically consistent. They then adopted an improved mixed selection method and conducted radish variety comparison tests in 1956. In 1957, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted production demonstrations at a total of nine locations in seven counties and cities in Guanzhong. The results showed that using the same cultivation method, the "Xinong Radish" averaged 8,000 jin per mu, 66.6% higher than the local radish varieties.

    "Xinong Radish" has heat resistance. Under the higher temperature conditions of August and September, the fleshy roots can still quickly grow large, and it also has strong disease resistance. It matures early, sown in early August each year, and can be harvested in late September. One radish can grow to about one and a half jin in weight. The maturity period of local farmhouse radishes generally requires one hundred days.

    This year, this variety will be expanded and promoted to many places in northern Shaanxi, southern Shaanxi, and Guanzhong.

    “西农萝卜”问世
    据新华社西安电　西北农学院讲师李洪元和蔬菜工人密切合作，经过几年试验，培育出一种新品种萝卜——“西农萝卜”。这种萝卜味甜，生吃熟吃都可以，水分大，成熟期早，产量也很高，很受农民欢迎。
    1953年冬，李洪元在教学试验农场的大青萝卜地和武功菜萝卜地中发现有根部巨大的天然杂交植株。1954年春，他就和蔬菜试验站工人研究，把这两种天然杂交的优良单株种植在一起，进行杂交。1954年到1956年，每年严格选择根部巨大的优良单株留种，并加强培育。到1956年，根部形态已基本一致。他们又采用改良混合选种法，在1956年进行萝卜品种比较试验。1957年经过陕西省农林厅在关中的七个县、市共九个点，进行生产示范。结果采用同样培育方法，“西农萝卜”平均亩产八千斤，比当地各种品种的萝卜亩产高出66.6％。
    “西农萝卜”具有抗热性，在8、9月较高温度条件下，肉质根部仍可迅速肥大，而且抗病性也强，成熟期早，每年8月初下种，9月下旬就可收获，一个萝卜就可长到一斤半重左右。而各地农家萝卜成熟期一般需要一百天。
    今年，这一品种将扩大推广到陕北、陕南和关中许多地方。
