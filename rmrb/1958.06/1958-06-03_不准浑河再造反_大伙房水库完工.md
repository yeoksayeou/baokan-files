Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. The first giant reservoir in Northeast China - the Dahuo房 Reservoir has been basically completed. On May 31st, the reservoir builders held a grand celebration at the foot of the newly completed dam. Leading organs of Liaoning Province and Fushun City, as well as representatives from other water conservancy construction units and local farmers, sent congratulations.

The Dahuo房 Reservoir began construction in November 1953 in Dahuo房 Village, Fushun City, to fundamentally control the water disasters of the Hun River, one of the largest tributaries of the Liao River. Over the past four and a half years, thousands upon thousands of builders have worked diligently here day and night. Now, only the finishing works remain, such as part of the revetment of the dam, part of the concrete of the spillway, and the road and decoration works on the dam surface. These projects will all be completed by August this year.

The reservoir has a storage capacity of 2 billion cubic meters. Among the large reservoirs already built in China, its storage capacity is second only to the Guanting and Meishan Reservoirs.

In the past, the Hun River caused enormous harm, and residents downstream suffered disasters of varying degrees almost every flood season, seriously threatening the safety of the two major industrial cities of Shenyang and Fushun. Now that the reservoir is completed, even if a catastrophic flood that occurs once in a thousand years were to happen, the downstream areas can be basically guaranteed to be free from harm. After the completion of the reservoir, the industrial water supply of Shenyang and Fushun will be more fully guaranteed; 90,000 hectares of paddy fields can be added downstream of the Hun River; and hydropower stations can be built and freshwater fish farming can be developed using the reservoir.

### 不准浑河再造反  大伙房水库完工

    不准浑河再造反
    大伙房水库完工
    据新华社沈阳2日电  东北地区第一座巨型水库——大伙房水库基本建成。5月31日，水库建设者们在刚完工的拦河大坝脚下，举行了盛大的庆祝大会。辽宁省和抚顺市的领导机关以及其他水利建设单位和当地农民，都派代表祝贺。
    大伙房水库是1953年11月1日在抚顺市的大伙房村，为根治辽河最大的支流之一——浑河的水患动工兴建的。四年半来千千万万建设者在这里日夜辛勤劳动。现在只剩下拦河大坝的部分护坡、溢洪道的部分混凝土以及坝面马路、装饰工程等收尾工程，这些工程到今年8月份也将全部结束。
    水库容水量为二十亿公方，在我国目前已经建成的大型水库中，蓄水量仅次于官厅、梅山两座水库。
    过去浑河为害巨大，下游居民几乎每年一到汛期都要受到程度不同的灾害，并且严重威胁着沈阳、抚顺两大工业城市的安全。现在水库建成了，即使遇到千年一遇的特大洪水，下游也基本上可以保证不受害了。水库建成以后，沈阳、抚顺两市的工业用水将得到更充分的供应；浑河下游可以多开九万公顷水田；还可以建设水电站和利用水库发展淡水养鱼事业。
