Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 4th: Shandan County, Gansu Province, now has eleven county-run factories and mines, and fourteen townships and thirty-seven communes each have two or more factories and mines. The county has already built seven backbone factories. This small county with a population of more than 120,000, shows once again that as long as minds are liberated and the masses are firmly relied upon, not only can small factories bloom everywhere, but backbone factories and mines can also be quickly established.

"First use indigenous methods, then mechanize," is a distinct characteristic of Shandan's vigorous development of local industry. All seven backbone factories and mines in the county that have already begun production have adopted indigenous methods. The cement factory uses indigenous methods to produce cement. More than forty workers, some water mills, stone rollers, and earthen kilns make up four workshops. The factory operates day and night in three shifts and can currently produce 30 tons of low-grade cement (150 to 200 grade) per day. They also plan to widely use water power for crushing and grinding, and to produce a total of 10,000 tons by the end of the year. Now, they plan to improve the cement grade. The refractory material factory is also "rustic," using donkeys to pull rollers for grinding, manually hammering to form blanks, and using earthen kilns to fire. This year, the output can reach 8,000 tons. This kind of refractory brick can withstand temperatures up to 1,780 degrees Celsius and can be used for iron smelting and general boilers. The factory has no thermometers for firing kilns, so the employees study the more than 500 years of experience accumulated by ceramic workers in mastering the firing process, and use glaze clay to make mud sticks to replace them. The small blast furnace in the iron smelting factory that produces two tons per day was built with local materials. There is no crushing machinery, no testing equipment, the workers are not very familiar with the grade of iron ore, and there is only a 7-horsepower blower, but they have also smelted gray cast iron. The other backbone factories and mines are the same, without engineers and technicians, without decent factory buildings, and without much mechanical equipment, using indigenous methods for production. The coal mine's planned output for this year is 300,000 tons, and the cost per ton of coal already produced is about 10 yuan lower than that of the state-owned Shandan Coal Mine. The coking plant has no equipment, but it will produce 6,000 tons of coke this year, which has already been used in iron smelting and can be fully supplied. The slogan put forward by the employees of the ceramic factory is: coarse and fine porcelain products should learn from Jingdezhen, catch up with Tangshan, and surpass Ankouyao. Due to the adoption of indigenous methods and the simplification of factory construction, the investment for these seven backbone factories and mines is only a few hundred yuan to more than 10,000 yuan, with an average investment of only 9,000 yuan each. The cement factory earned back all its investment of more than 310 yuan in just a few days. The 15,000 yuan investment in the iron smelting factory can also be fully earned back in just one or two months. These factories and mines have all formulated preliminary plans, and in two to three years, they can use their own surplus to achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization. Currently, among the thirty-two factories and mines in the county that need machinery and equipment, the machinery and equipment for four factories and mines have already been purchased, the complete sets of machinery and equipment for fifteen factories and mines have been ordered and can be purchased in the third quarter, and the main equipment for four other factories and mines has also been ordered. The rest are actively looking for clues.

Shandan County plans to establish a total of twelve backbone factories and mines this year. In addition to the above seven, the remaining five factories for glass, charcoal refining, oil refining, papermaking, etc., are being prepared and can all be put into production before the end of September. There will be new increases in industries run by townships and communes. The planned total number of factories to be built this year will be 557, with an output value of more than 9.5 million yuan. The slogan put forward by the county party committee is: "Brave the wind and waves, grasp the backbone; develop the general in a widespread manner." (Attached picture)

### 土办法先上马　再来机械化  山丹很快办起七个骨干厂

    土办法先上马　再来机械化
    山丹很快办起七个骨干厂
    本报兰州4日电　甘肃山丹县现有十一个县办厂矿，十四个乡和三十七个社都有厂矿两个以上，全县已建起七个骨干厂。这个有十二万多人口的小县，大办地方工业的进度再次说明，只要思想解放，坚决依靠群众，不但小型工厂可以遍地开花，骨干厂矿也可以很快地办起来。
    “土法先上马，再来机械化”，是山丹大办地方工业的一个鲜明特点。全县已投入生产的七个骨干厂矿，都采用了土办法。水泥厂用土法制水泥，四十多个工人，一些水磨、石碾子和土窑，组成了四个车间。这个厂日夜三班，目前每天可产低标号水泥（一五零到二零零号）三十吨。还准备广泛利用水力粉碎碾磨，到年底共生产一万吨。现在，他们计划要提高水泥标号，耐火材料厂也是“土里土气”，驴拉碾子研磨，人工捶打成坯，用土窑来烧，今年产量可以达到八千吨，这种耐火砖耐温可达一千七百八十度，能用于炼铁和一般锅炉。这个厂烧窑没有温度计，职工就学习陶瓷工人积累五百多年的掌握火候的经验，用釉土做成泥棒来代替。炼铁厂日产两吨的一座小高炉是用当地材料建成的，没有粉碎机械，没有化验设备，工人不大熟悉铁矿石的品位，只有一部七马力的鼓风机，但也冶炼出了灰口铁。其他几个骨干厂矿也是这样，没有工程师和技术员，没有像样的厂房，也没有什么机械设备，用土法进行生产。煤矿今年计划是三十万吨的产量，已经生产出的煤炭，每吨成本比国营山丹煤矿低十元左右。炼焦厂没有什么设备，今年要生产焦炭六千吨，它已用到炼铁上，可以充分供应。陶瓷厂职工提出的口号是：粗细瓷品要学习景德镇、赶上唐山，超过安口窑。由于采用土办法，建厂因陋就简，这七个骨干厂矿，投资只要几百元到一万多元，平均每个投资只有九千元。水泥厂几天就赚回了全部投资三百一十多元，炼铁厂的一万五千元投资，也只要一两个月就可以全部赚回。这几个厂矿都已订出初步规划，两年到三年就可以用自己的盈余实现半机械化和机械化。现在，全县需要机器设备的三十二个厂矿，有四个厂矿的机器设备已经进货，十五个厂矿的全套机器设备已经订妥，第三季度可以进货，还有四个厂矿的主要设备也已订妥，其余正在积极寻找线索。
    山丹县计划今年共办骨干厂矿十二个，除上述七个外，其余玻璃、炭炼油、造纸等五个厂正在筹建，9月底前可以全部投入生产，乡和社办的工业又有新的增加，计划今年办厂总数要在五百五十七个，产值要达到九百五十多万元。县委提出的口号是：“乘风破浪，抓骨干；遍地开花搞一般”。（附图片）
