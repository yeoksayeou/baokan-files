Relying on the Central Government, Relying on Local Authorities, Relying on Experts, Relying on the Masses
The Nation's Scientific Undertakings are Flourishing Vigorously

    (Report from this newspaper) Relying on the central government, relying on local authorities, relying on experts, and relying on the masses, a nationwide upsurge in large-scale scientific undertakings and all-people learning of science and technology has emerged in various regions. A scientific research network covering all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, special zones, counties, townships, and communes is gradually taking shape.
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences originally had four branches, established in Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang; it originally had three offices, located in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Kunming. Starting this year, in less than half a year, the Shaanxi Provincial Branch was born as early as the end of April, and the Zhejiang Provincial Branch was established successively on June 17. At present, most provinces have contacted and consulted with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and are actively preparing to establish branches of the Academy of Sciences or relevant scientific research institutions. It can be expected that the establishment of these provincial, municipal, and autonomous region scientific research centers will greatly promote the development of the national scientific undertaking.
    Under the illumination of the general line of socialist construction, all parts of the country are breaking down the mysterious concepts of science and technology, and many counties, townships, and communes have established scientific research institutions and launched activities to learn and apply science. These research institutions are established according to the needs of local production development, including agriculture, forestry, industry, health, and so on. Acheng County in Heilongjiang Province was the first to establish a Science and Technology Research Committee in early April, and successfully researched and trial-produced more than a dozen new-style agricultural tools such as wind turbines and water turbine generators, which were supplied to agricultural production in a timely manner. Xiangtan County in Hunan Province, on the basis of cadre experimental fields, established an Agricultural Science Experimental Research Institute, which widely conducted research on cash crops, wild feed, new agricultural tools, animal husbandry, meteorology, and paddy and dryland crops. Wugang County in this province also established an industrial research institute to conduct experiments on artificial petroleum and rice bran wine brewing. After the Lixian County Agricultural Science Research Institute in Shaanxi Province was established in May, more than 20 agricultural research institutions were successively established in Gaoling, Zhashui, Luochuan, Danfeng and other counties and agricultural cooperatives, and research work has also been widely carried out. In addition, Xiushui County in Jiangxi Province established an Agricultural Science Research Institute, Huangzhong County in Qinghai Province established a Science and Technology Research Committee, and Haining County in Zhejiang Province established two scientific research institutes for agriculture and health. The Minhou County Science Research Institute in Fujian Province has also recently been born. The establishment of scientific and technological organizations in townships and communes is even more like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In Lai'an County, Anhui Province, all agricultural cooperatives and production teams have established amateur technical schools and technical research groups. In Minhou County, Fujian Province, every township has a technical night school and every cooperative has a technical research group. These thousands upon thousands of mass scientific research organizations, driven by the county's scientific research institutions, are conducting research work very actively.
    These newly established scientific research institutions at the provincial, county, township, and commune levels have widely absorbed "local experts," technical innovators, veteran farmers, and veteran workers as researchers, and have taken the creations and inventions, advanced experiences, and various problems in industrial and agricultural production as research objects. All research work proceeds from reality, faces production, and serves production. In this way, scientific research work is pushed to the forefront of production, which will play an extremely significant role in improving production and promoting technological innovation. At the same time, it will also promote the rapid, better, and more economical development of my country's scientific undertakings and catch up with the world's most advanced levels more rapidly.

    靠中央  靠地方  靠专家  靠群众
    全国科学事业轰轰烈烈
    本报讯　靠中央、靠地方、靠专家、靠群众，全国大办科学事业和全民学习科学技术之风，已经在各地兴起。一个遍布全国各省、市、自治区、专区、县、乡、社的科学研究网正在开始逐步形成。
    中国科学院原有四个分院，建立在兰州、武汉、广州和新疆四地；原有三个办事处，分设在上海、南京和昆明。今年开始，不到半年的时间内，陕西省分院已经早在4月底诞生，浙江省分院相继在6月17日成立。目前绝大部分省份已经和中国科学院取得了联系和进行了商谈，积极筹备建立科学院分院或有关科学研究机构。可以预期，这些省、市、自治区科学研究中心的建立，将大大促进全国科学事业的发展。
    在社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，全国各地大破对于科学技术的神秘观念，很多县、乡、社都办起科学研究机构，展开了学科学、用科学的活动。这些研究机构都是根据当地生产发展的需要办起来的，有农业的、林业的、工业的、卫生的等等。黑龙江省阿城县第一个在4月初成立了科学技术研究委员会，研究试制成功了风动机、水轮发电机等十多种新式农具，适时供应了农业生产的需要。湖南省湘潭县在干部试验田的基础上，建立了农业科学实验研究所，广泛对经济作物、野生饲料、新式农具、畜牧业、气象和水旱田作物等进行了研究。这个省的武冈县也建立一个工业研究所，进行人造石油和稻糠酿酒的试验。陕西省醴泉县农业科学研究所在5月间成立以后，高陵、柞水、洛川、丹凤等县和农业社相继建立了二十多个农业研究机构，研究工作也已普遍展开。此外，江西省修水县成立了农业科学研究所，青海省湟中县成立了科学技术研究委员会，浙江省海宁县成立了农业、卫生两个科学研究所。福建省闽侯县科学研究所也在最近诞生。乡社的科学技术组织的成立更如雨后春笋，安徽省来安县各农业社和生产队都成立了业余技术学校和技术研究小组。福建省闽侯县乡乡都有技术夜校，社社都有技术研究小组。这些成千成百的群众性的科学研究组织，在县的科学研究机构的带动下，研究工作十分活跃。
    这些省、县、乡、社的新建立的科学研究机构，广泛吸收了“土专家”、技术革新者、老农、老工人等作为研究员，把工农业生产中的创造发明、先进经验和各种问题作为研究对象。一切研究工作都从实际出发，面向生产，为生产服务。这样，就把科学研究工作推到了生产最前线，对于提高生产、推动技术革新，将起着极为显著的作用。同时，也将促进我国的科学事业多快好省地发展，更加迅速地赶上世界最先进的水平。
