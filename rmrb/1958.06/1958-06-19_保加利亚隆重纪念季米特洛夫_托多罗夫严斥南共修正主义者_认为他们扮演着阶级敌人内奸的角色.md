Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 17th: The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the National Committee of the Fatherland Front, and the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a solemn rally here on the evening of the 17th to commemorate the 76th anniversary of the birth of Dimitrov, the leader and mentor of the Bulgarian people.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and others attended the commemoration meeting.

Todorov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, he spoke in detail about Dimitrov's spirit of boundless loyalty to the people, to socialism, and to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and sternly criticized the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He said that imperialists are very hostile to the great achievements of the socialist camp and the international workers' movement, and they are trying every possible means to undermine our unity and weaken our ranks. In the international workers' movement, modern revisionists play the role of class enemies and traitors. Modern revisionism is most clearly manifested in the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Todorov said that our party, educated and trained by Blagoev and Dimitrov, is always irreconcilable with any revisionists and any attempts to distort Marxism. To this day, the history of our party has confirmed this, and the recently concluded Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party has demonstrated this particularly powerfully.

    保加利亚隆重纪念季米特洛夫
    托多罗夫严斥南共修正主义者
    认为他们扮演着阶级敌人内奸的角色
    新华社索非亚17日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会、祖国阵线全国委员会和保加利亚共产党索非亚市委员会17日晚在这里举行隆重集会，纪念保加利亚人民的领袖和导师季米特洛夫七十六周年诞辰。
    保加利亚党政领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫等出席了纪念会。
    保共中央书记托多罗夫在会上作了报告。他在报告中详细地谈到了季米特洛夫无限忠于人民、忠于社会主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的精神，并且严正地批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领。他说，帝国主义分子非常仇视社会主义阵营和国际工人运动所取得的巨大成就，他们正在千方百计地企图破坏我们的团结和削弱我们的队伍。在国际工人运动中，现代修正主义者扮演着阶级敌人内奸的角色。现代修正主义在南共第七次代表大会所通过的纲领中得到了最明显的表现。
    托多罗夫说，我们的党是由布拉戈耶夫和季米特洛夫教导和锻炼出来的，它同任何修正主义分子和任何歪曲马克思主义的企图始终是不调和的。到目前为止，我们党的历史证实了这一点，不久前闭幕的保共第七次代表大会又特别有力地表明了这一点。
