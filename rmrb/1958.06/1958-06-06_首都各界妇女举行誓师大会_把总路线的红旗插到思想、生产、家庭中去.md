Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Women from all walks of life in the capital held a swearing-in rally today to publicize and implement the General Line. The rally called on all women in the city to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and participate in socialist construction in greater, faster, better, and more economical ways, contributing all their strength to building the capital into a modern industrial base within five years.

More than 1,300 women representatives from all walks of life participated in the meeting. Many women representatives reported on the situation of women in their units in implementing the General Line. Han Chaxian, a female worker from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, said that breaking superstitions and liberating minds have become the practical actions of all the female workers in the factory. Now a wave of technical innovation has been set off throughout the factory. After the eight procedures of the roving section were reduced to four, the output of yarn doubled. He Baolan, chairman of the Women's Federation of the Da Dongliu Township, said that the township's childcare organizations have taken in more than 80% of the children in the township, liberating more than 1,100 women from housework to participate in production. Women representatives from 15 units, including the Beijing Woolen Textile Factory, also carried large "Double Happiness" characters and various slogan signs onto the stage to report good news to the meeting. The women in these units have made contributions in various positions.

Zhang Xiaomei, chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, and Wu Qing, secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting successively. In her speech, Wu Qing listed a large number of moving deeds of women heroes in socialist construction. She said that the era of "women can't do it" has passed. Today is a new era in which women can do everything, know how to do everything, and can do everything well. She called on women to cut off their sense of inferiority, give full play to their creativity and initiative, and actively participate in the technological revolution and cultural revolution. In addition to planting the red flag in thought and production labor, they should also plant the red flag in family and life. (Attached picture)

　　首都各界妇女举行誓师大会
    把总路线的红旗插到思想、生产、家庭中去
    新华社5日讯　首都各界妇女今天举行宣传贯彻总路线誓师大会。大会号召全市妇女破除迷信，解放思想，多快好省地参加社会主义建设，为争取在五年内把首都建设成一个现代化的工业基地贡献一切力量。
    参加大会的各界妇女有一千三百多人。许多妇女代表在会上报告了本单位妇女贯彻执行总路线的情况。清河制呢厂女工韩茶仙说，破除迷信、解放思想，已经成为这个工厂全体女工的实际行动。现在全厂已经掀起技术革新的热潮，粗纱工段的八道工序改为四道后，纱的产量增加了一倍。大东流乡妇联主任何宝兰说，这个乡的托儿组织已收托了全乡80％以上的孩子，把一千一百多名妇女从家务中解放出来参加了生产。北京市毛纺织厂等十五个单位的妇女代表还抬着大喜字和各种标语牌到台上向大会报喜。这些单位的妇女都在各种不同的岗位上作出了贡献。
    北京市妇女联合会主席张晓梅和全国妇联书记处书记吴綪先后在大会上讲了话。吴綪在讲话中列举了大批妇女英雄在社会主义建设中的动人事迹。她说，“妇女不行”的时代已经成为过去。今天是妇女一切都能做，一切都会做，一切都能做得好的新时代。她号召妇女们砍掉自卑感，充分发挥创造性、主动性，积极参加技术革命和文化革命，除了在思想上和生产劳动方面插上红旗外，还要把红旗插到家庭和生活中去。（附图片）
