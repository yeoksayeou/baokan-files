Hardworking and Meticulous Changshu Farmers
By our reporters Gu Ping, Sun Zhen, Zhou Zhesheng

The heroic people of Changshu, having overcome the severe rice blast and stem rust diseases unseen in over twenty years, have achieved a doubled bumper harvest of summer crops this year, with an average yield of 310 jin. Their enthusiasm is growing, and they are even more daring to think, speak, act, and achieve. Recently, when our reporters accompanied the county party secretaries of Jiangsu Province to visit Changshu County, we and all the visitors were deeply inspired by this new summer situation.

Loads Packed Grain by Grain into Storage

When we arrived at the Nanbei Agricultural Cooperative in Tangqiao Township, we saw various colors of old and new bedsheets,麻袋 (ma dai) sacks, and bamboo sieves in the wheat fields, a scene we had never witnessed before. We asked, "Why bring the bedsheets to the fields?" Fifty-year-old female cooperative member Pang Abao proudly told the reporters, "This is a method we all came up with." At the beginning of the summer harvest, many cooperatives mobilized their members to contribute ideas on how to achieve high yields and ensure that every grain is stored. Many members proposed "packing by the load," using bedsheets and sacks to wrap the wheat ears, packing one load and carrying one load. The women of the Nanbei Agricultural Cooperative searched for sacks and sewed bedsheets overnight, some even taking apart the linings of their cotton quilts. Pang Abao said, "If we can think of it, we can do it. Even the new bedsheets of the brides have been brought out." The bride Tang Rongdi, who was cutting wheat nearby, raised her head and happily said, "New bedsheets are nothing special. If we harvest more grain, we'll have everything. If the bedsheets get old, we can buy new ones." They said that using bedsheets to wrap the wheat can increase the yield by five jin per mu. We also saw an elderly woman sweeping wheat grains on the ridges with a broom. She carefully used her fingernails to pick out the wheat kernels embedded in the mud, one by one, and placed them in a basket. The team leader told us that she is a "five-guarantee household" in the cooperative, and she washes the wheat she picks up clean every day and hands it over to the team.

Everywhere in Changshu County, one could see various novel and moving scenes of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing. Many agricultural cooperatives this year have achieved "no cracks on the threshing ground, no wheat ears on the ground, and no grains on the ears." Before harvesting, they meticulously filled in every crack on the threshing ground. Some cooperatives placed many bamboo sieves in the fields, putting a handful of wheat in each sieve to avoid scattering the grains. Some cooperatives did not bundle or tie the wheat, but placed it on stretchers made of bamboo poles, carrying it gently across the field banks and small bridges as if carrying a sedan chair.

The joy of the harvest excited everyone. Not only farmers, but also more than 100,000 urban residents, workers, cadres, school teachers and students, and soldiers all participated in the summer harvest campaign. During the day, there were no idle people at home, and at night, the fields were full of lights. Everyone who could wield a sickle competed to contribute to the summer harvest. In the Bixi Township Second Agricultural Cooperative, eighty-year-olds Yin Laodie and Wu Laotai also challenged each other. The challenge condition proposed by Yin Laodie was to guarantee daily attendance during the summer harvest. Wu Laotai responded by saying, "Daily attendance is nothing special. We must also ensure that the summer harvest work is done quickly and well." On the first day of the competition, Yin Laodie went to the field with a sickle before dawn, thinking that Wu Laotai would fall behind this time. But when he arrived at the field, he saw that Wu Laotai had already cut a large patch of wheat. Wu Laotai straightened her back and said with a smile, "Yin Laodie, you've lost, haven't you?" Yin Laodie shook his head and said, "Wait and see!" Early the next morning, when Wu Laotai arrived at the field, Yin Laodie had already worked for half the night.

Deep Plowing One Inch Increases Production by Ten Percent

The fact that the three wheat crops have yielded a bumper harvest has further boosted the enthusiasm of the people of Changshu. The targets for increasing rice production have been further accelerated, and various measures are being intensified. The Xinzhuang Township First Cooperative originally planned for a rice yield of 800 jin per mu, but later raised it to 1,000 jin, then 1,300 jin, and recently put forward the slogan of guaranteeing 1,500 jin and striving for 2,000 jin. As a result, the requirements for deep plowing and close planting have also been increased. The original requirement was for plowing five inches deep, but now it is seven inches. To ensure deep plowing on every mu, the cooperative organized strong laborers to form a deep plowing brigade, divided into three teams. Forty head of cattle were distributed among the three teams. The cooperative members said that even without tractors, old cattle and new plows could outperform tractors. They named the teams "Tractor Stations," and the cattle sheds were all hung with signs reading "No. × Tractor Station" to ensure the completion of the deep plowing task. If the cattle power was not enough, human power was added. In one week, they plowed 520 mu of land, of which 350 mu were plowed twice, mostly exceeding the standard of seven inches.

In the fields, everywhere one could see farmers shouting at the plowing cattle, with the cattle pulling double-wheeled double-share plows or new-style walking plows to turn the soil. The plowing hands sang plowing songs: "Plow deep, the rice roots will be strong, absorb enough nutrients, guaranteeing double thousands of jin."

Walking into Xinzhuang First Cooperative, a large red flag with the words "Deep Plowing Shock Brigade" written on it fluttered high in the sky. Young and strong lads vigorously raised their rakes under the red flag, sinking them five inches deep with one stroke, then eight inches with another, some even reaching more than a foot deep. The shock brigade members constantly used rulers to measure the depth of the soil, checking and supervising each other.

"Deep plowing one inch increases production by ten percent, work harder!" The team members happily responded to each other.

Rice Transplanting Better Than Embroidery

Every meter in the paddy field was marked with a string. Male and female cooperative members wearing large red "Rice Transplanting Combatant" badges meticulously transplanted rice seedlings. Like skillful "embroidery girls," they embroidered neat green patterns in the black and shiny paddy fields. Each person also had a one-meter-long ruler at hand, which they used to measure from time to time whether the prescribed number of plants had been planted. After transplanting one row, they would insert a bamboo stick with their name written on it at the end of the row, so that the inspectors could check it. The cooperative members called this bamboo stick the "responsibility sign." The four things—responsibility sign, string, ruler, and red badge—were the glorious certificates for every rice transplanter after graduating from training and internship.

The teenagers liked to compete to do the work of moving the strings. They measured and measured, not letting go of even a fraction of a millimeter. The old farmers constantly praised on the edge of the field: "Now planting rice! It's really like embroidery, how can the yield not increase!"

All preparatory work was done before transplanting. To ensure that every mu received 300担 (dan, a unit of dry measure) of basal fertilizer and that the specification of deep plowing six to eight inches was implemented in every field, the townships organized inspection, evaluation, and acceptance brigades. After inspection and acceptance, certificates were issued to those that met the standards, and those that did not meet the standards were immediately reworked. The irrigation stations only provided water for transplanting with the acceptance certificate. After transplanting, the cooperative's water controllers inserted water level markers with white bottoms and red lines in the paddy fields and checked the water level in the fields every day. If there was too little water in the field, they immediately opened the gate to draw water from the irrigation canal; if there was too much water in the field, they drained it in time, achieving shallow water and frequent irrigation. We saw that the water depth in many rice fields was between six and seven centimeters on the scale.

The county's 400,000 mu of early rice is full of seedlings, and 700,000 mu of late rice is being transplanted intensely. Changshu farmers want to increase rice production by one to three or four times compared to last year.

Fully Utilize the "Ten Edges"

During the busy season, in Changshu County we saw some old people and children wearing "Ten Edges Administrator" badges, planting and cultivating melons and vegetables on the roadsides, ditch sides, canal banks, and around their homes. Seedlings that had already sprouted, such as pumpkins, soybeans, sunflowers, and sesame, were protected by ropes, with signs next to them indicating the number of plants and the name of the administrator. The people of Changshu County have realized the grand ideal of the ancient sages, "making full use of the land's advantages," and fully utilized the idle land and gaps in the "ten edges" such as threshing ground edges, pit edges, field ridge edges, and mountain foot edges to extract more grain from the land. Their battle slogan is: "Not an inch of land is missed, not a point is left empty." Achieving "melon vines and bean pods everywhere, sorghum and corn forming shade, sunflowers and castor beans adding color, and sesame and millet competing for glory." The masses have handed over miscellaneous grains used as non-staple foods to the cooperative as seeds for the "ten edges" planting. Members of the Zhizhang Township Second Cooperative took out more than 7,000 jin of soybean seeds, saying, "Save a bite now, and eat a斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure) in the future." On the eve of the summer harvest and planting, thousands of members of eight agricultural cooperatives such as Zhaiqian and Dongzhen in Liantang Township spent a day and a half planting two million corn, soybean, and sorghum plants on the 40-华里 (hua li, a unit of distance) long and three-尺 (chi, a unit of length) wide wasteland on both sides of the highway. Many agricultural cooperatives built frames several miles long on both sides of the road, allowing the climbing melons and beans to grow into the air. In the past month or so, the people of the county have utilized the "ten edges" and intercropping and replanting areas of more than 200,000 mu. This year, the area of "ten edges" and intercropping and replanting will reach 800,000 mu. Once this plan is realized, it can increase the production of grain, feed, and vegetables by more than 1 billion jin, which will greatly enrich people's lives and increase livestock feed.

After the bumper harvest of summer crops, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of Changshu County has become even more vigorous. Riding the wave, they are advancing victoriously towards the higher reaches.

    实干细作的常熟农民
    本报记者　古平　孙振　周哲生
    英雄的常熟人民，今年战胜二十多年未有的严重的赤霉病和秆锈病，获得夏熟作物翻一番的大丰收，平均产量三百一十斤。他们的干劲越来越大，越加敢想敢说敢作敢为了。记者最近随中共江苏省各县县委书记到常熟县参观，这种夏季新形势深深地感染了我们，感染了所有到这里参观的人们。
    担担包装颗粒到仓
    我们到了塘桥乡南北农业社，麦田里放了各色新旧被单、麻袋、竹匾，这是我们从来没有看到的新景象。我们就问“为什么把被单拿到田里来了？”五十多岁的女社员庞阿宝骄傲地告诉记者说：“这是我们大家想出来的办法。”在夏收开始的时候，很多社发动社员献计，如何丰产丰收，颗粒归仓，许多社员提出“担担包装”，他们拿出被单、麻袋包住麦穗，包一担挑一担。南北农业社妇女们连夜找麻袋，缝被单，有的把棉被里子拆下来。庞阿宝说：“我们想得出就做得到，连新娘子的新被单也拿来了。”正在旁边割麦的新娘子唐荣娣抬起头来高兴地说：“新被单有什么稀奇，多收粮食，什么都有了。被单用旧了再买新的。”他们说用被单包麦，每亩可以多收五斤粮食。我们还看到一个老年妇女拿着扫帚在田埂上扫麦粒，她仔细地用指甲把嵌在泥里的麦子一粒一粒剔出来，放在淘箩里。队长告诉我们，她是社里的五保户，每天她把拾到的麦子淘洗干净交给队里。
    在常熟县到处可以看到多种多样新颖的精收细打的动人情景。很多农业社今年做到“场上不见缝，地上不见穗，穗上不见粒”。在收割前，他们细心地填平场地上的每一条裂缝，有些社在田里放了很多竹匾，割一把放一把，避免麦粒抛撒。也有的社不捆不扎，把麦子放在用竹竿做的担架上，像抬轿子似的轻轻地走过田岸和小桥。
    丰收的喜悦激动着每一个人。不仅农民，十多万城镇居民、工人、机关干部、学校师生、部队，也都投入了夏收运动。白天家里无闲人，夜晚田野遍是灯。凡是拿得动镰刀的人都争着为夏收出力。碧溪乡第二农业社，八十高龄的殷老爹和吴老太，也相互挑战比高低。殷老爹提出的挑战条件是：保证在夏收中天天出工。吴老太应战说：“天天出工不稀奇，还要保证夏收农活做得快，做得好。“竞赛第一天，天刚亮，殷老爹拿了镰刀下田，心想这下子吴老太该落在后面了。等到走上田头一看，吴老太已经割了一大片麦子。吴老太直了直腰，笑盈盈地说：“殷老爹，你输了吧。”殷老爹摇摇头说：“等着瞧哟！”第二天一早，吴老太赶到田里时，殷老爹已干了半夜。
    深耕一寸增产一成
    三麦获得丰收的事实，进一步鼓舞了常熟人民的干劲。水稻增产指标进一步跃进，各项措施都在加码。辛庄乡一社原计划水稻单产八百斤，后来上升到一千斤，一千三百斤，最近又提出保证一千五百斤争取二千斤的行动口号。这样，深耕、密植等要求也随之提高了，原要求深耕五寸，现在要七寸了。为了保证亩亩深耕，社里组织强劳力成立了深耕大队，下分三个中队。四十头耕牛分配在三个队里。社员们说现在没有拖拉机，老牛加新式犁，也要干过拖拉机。他们自己命名成立了三个“拖拉机站”，牛棚门口都挂上了“第×拖拉机站”的牌子，保证深耕任务的完成。牛力不够，就加上人力。一星期中，他们翻耕了五百二十亩田，其中三百五十亩耕过两遍，大都超过了七寸的标准。
    在田野里，到处看到农民吆喝着耕牛，耕牛牵引着双轮双铧犁或新式步犁在翻犁土地。耕田手们高唱耕田歌：“耕地耕得深，稻根扎得稳，养分吸得足，双千斤有保证”。
    走进辛庄一社，写着“深耕突击队”字样的大红旗在田野上空高高飘扬。年青力壮的小伙子们在红旗下面使劲地举起钉耙，一耙下去五寸深，再加一耙，八寸，有的竟深达一尺有余。突击队员们不时地用尺量一量土的深度，互相检查督促。
    “深耕一寸，增产一成，加油干啊！”队员们彼此欢快地呼应。
    插秧赛过描龙绣凤
    秧田里每隔一公尺拉一根绳。身上配着“莳秧战斗员”大红胸章的男女社员们在精心地栽秧。他们像灵巧的“绣花姑娘”一样，在乌光发亮的秧田里绣上了整齐的绿色图案。每人手边还有一根一公尺长的尺，他们不时地量一量，是否栽足了规定的株数。栽完一趟，就在田头插上一根写有自己名字的竹签，让验收员来验收。社员们把这竹竿叫做责任牌。责任牌、绳、尺、红色胸章这四样东西是每一个莳秧手经过训练、实习毕业后的光荣证件。
    少年们最喜欢抢着做移绳的工作了。他们量了又量，一分一厘也不放松。老农们在田岸边不断地赞叹：现在种田啊！真是描龙绣凤，产量怎能不提高！
    插秧以前都做好了一切准备工作。为了保证每亩基肥三百担，深耕六寸到八寸的规格贯彻到每一块田，各乡组织了检查评比验收大队。经过检查验收，合标准的发给验收证，不合标准的立即再行加工。戽水机站凭验收证才给打水栽秧。在插秧以后，社里的放水员就在稻田里插上白底红线的量水标尺，并每天到田间检查水位。田里水少了，立即开闸从灌溉渠里进水；田里水过多了，及时排水，做到浅水勤灌。我们看到许多稻田，水深都在标尺的六公分到七公分之间。
    全县四十万亩早稻满田秧禾，七十万亩晚稻正在紧张栽插。常熟农民要把水稻产量比去年提高一倍以至三、四倍。
    充分利用“十边”
    在紧张的大忙季节里，我们在常熟县看到一些老人和少年儿童，身上配着“十边管理员”的胸章，在路边、沟边、渠道两岸和家前屋后栽种和培植瓜菜。已经出苗的南瓜、黄豆、向日葵及芝麻等作物，都用绳子拦护起来，旁边插有写着各项作物的株数及管理人姓名的牌子。常熟县人民实现了古圣先贤“尽地利”的远大理想，把场边、坑缸边、田埂边、山脚边等“十边”的闲土隙地充分利用起来，向土地索取更多的粮食。他们的战斗口号是：“寸土不漏，一点不空”。达到“瓜藤豆夹遍地，高粱玉米成荫，葵花蓖麻衬色，芝麻小米争艳”。群众纷纷把用作副食品的杂粮交给社里，作为“十边”种植的种子。支塘乡二社社员拿出豆种七千多斤，他们说：“现在省一口，将来吃一斗。”练塘乡宅前、东镇等八个农业社的上千个社员，在夏收夏种前夕，突击一天半，在境内长达四十华里长、三尺宽的公路两旁荒地上种植两百万棵玉米、黄豆和高粱。很多农业社在大路两旁搭上几里路长的架子，让蔓藤的瓜豆向空中发展。全县人民近一个多月来利用“十边”和田间套种复种面达二十多万亩。今年利用“十边”和套种复种面积要达到八十万亩，单这一计划实现后，可增产粮食、饲料和蔬菜十亿多斤，这将大大丰富人民生活，增加牲畜饲料。
    夏熟作物丰收以后，常熟县人民的革命干劲越加旺盛，他们在以水涨船高之势，乘胜而进，奔向更上游。
