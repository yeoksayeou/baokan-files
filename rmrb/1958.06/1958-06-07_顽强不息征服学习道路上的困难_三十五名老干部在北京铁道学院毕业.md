Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. Thirty-five veteran cadres on China's railway transportation front, after three and a half years of arduous effort, have completed courses at the Beijing Railway Institute that ordinary students would take seven or ten years to complete. These days, they are gradually taking up their work posts with college diplomas.

In just three and a half years, these thirty-five veteran cadres have made up for or reviewed junior and senior high school courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and have completed the main courses of all the professional courses in the Railway Transportation Department. According to the person in charge of the Railway Institute, this group of cadres has now mastered the scientific and technical knowledge necessary to be expert leaders in the socialist railway construction cause.

This is an extraordinary learning speed. When they first entered the gates of the Beijing Railway Institute in October 1954, most of them only had a junior high school education, and eight of them had not even finished elementary school in the past. How were the various difficulties in front of them overcome? Before graduation, they summarized their learning experiences and unanimously believed that the central issue was to both despise difficulties and conscientiously overcome specific difficulties with an indomitable fighting will. Some people who had not even finished elementary school originally felt like they were "sitting on a spinning wheel, dizzy and not knowing what the teacher was talking about" when listening to lectures. Some people saw that the distance between their original foundation and the content to be learned was too great and advised them to transfer.

Gu Liangyu and Jin Yucheng, who had only studied in private schools for four or five years, were both the objects of people's advice to transfer at that time. Jin Yucheng is forty-eight years old this year and is a veteran cadre with twenty-nine years of revolutionary history. During the Long March, he crossed the grasslands twice and was wounded three times in various battles. He never wavered or retreated in any battle. However, his brain nerves were injured in the war, so his memory was very weak. When people advised him to drop out of school, he said without hesitation:
	"If this is an organizational decision, I will obey; if it is the suggestion and advice of comrades, I will not accept it." He believes that he has experienced so many difficulties in the past twenty years of combat and has overcome them victoriously. Can he be intimidated by the difficulties in front of him? He said to people: "If others use one hour to study, I will use two hours. If that's not enough, I will use three hours. I must study it." In these three and a half years, he has consistently gotten up early and gone to bed late, even on holidays. He did not get discouraged because he failed a few exams. He often visited teachers to ask for advice and regarded every classmate in the class as a teacher, asking them for advice anytime, anywhere. Now, he has finally graduated with a passing grade.

Before 1945, Gu Liangyu was a station worker on the Beijing-Baotou Railway. After joining the revolution, he fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries with the troops in the Jin-Sui area. After the national liberation, he worked as the vice chairman of the district trade union in the Beijing Railway Administration. He believes that as an ordinary worker, he was able to complete many tasks assigned to him by the Party and the people in the past, and he can even more complete the task of learning this time. He did not waver at all when people advised him to transfer. In the learning process, like in other work, he always constantly researched and improved learning methods, and compiled a scientific assignment schedule according to the daily learning program. Each program specified the main methods to be adopted and the basic requirements to be met. For things that had to be memorized, he wrote them in a small notebook and carried them with him, taking them out to read whenever he had time. He not only quickly eliminated the phenomenon of failing grades in learning, but also obtained a score of five in most subjects. This time, he graduated with honors.

On the eve of graduation, Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao held a forum with these veteran cadres, encouraging them to return to their work posts and combine the classroom knowledge they have learned with practice, to go all out and aim high, to rely on the masses, and to make greater achievements in the technical revolution and cultural revolution that have already arrived.

### 顽强不息征服学习道路上的困难  三十五名老干部在北京铁道学院毕业

　　顽强不息征服学习道路上的困难
    三十五名老干部在北京铁道学院毕业
    新华社6日讯　我国铁路运输战线上有三十五名老干部，经过三年半时间的艰苦努力，在北京铁道学院学完了一般学生在七年或十年时间里才能学完的课程。这几天，他们正在带着高等学校的毕业证书，陆续走上工作岗位。
    这三十五名老干部在短短三年半的时间里，补习或复习了初中和高中的数学、物理、化学课程，读完了铁道运输系的所有专业课的主要课程。据铁道学院负责人谈，现在这批干部已经掌握了作为社会主义铁路建设事业内行领导者必需具备的科学技术知识。
    这是个不平常的学习速度。他们在1954年10月刚跨进北京铁道学院的大门时，多数人只具有初中的文化水平，有八人过去小学也没有念完。横在他们面前的种种困难是怎样克服的？毕业前他们总结了自己的学习经验，一致认为中心的问题是既要藐视困难，又要以顽强不息的战斗意志勤勤恳恳地来克服具体困难。原来小学也没有念完的一些人，最初听课时就像“坐在旋盘上那样眼花头眩，不知老师在讲些什么”。有些人看他们原有的基础和要学的内容相距太大，曾劝他们转学。
    只在私塾里念过四、五年书的谷良玉和金玉成，都是那时人们劝告转学的对象。金玉成现年四十八岁，是一个有二十九年革命历史的老干部。在长征中他曾经两次过草地，在各种战斗中负过三次伤，每次战斗他都没有动摇或退却过。但是在战争中他的脑神经被震伤，因此记忆力很弱。当人们劝告他退学的时候，他毫不犹疑地说：
  “如果这是组织上的决定，我就服从；如果是同志们的建议和劝告，我就不接受。”他认为在过去二十多年的战斗中经历了那么多的困难都胜利地克服了，眼前的这一点困难就能被吓退吗？他对人说：“在学习上别人用一个小时，我用两个小时，如果还不行，我就用三个小时，也一定要学下去。”在这三年半的时间里，他始终如一地早起晚睡，假日也不例外。他并不因为有几次考试不及格就灰心。他常常登门请教老师，并且把全班的每个同学也都当作老师，随时随地向他们请教。现在，他终于以学业及格毕业了。
    谷良玉1945年前是京包线上一个车站的站工，参加革命后，他随部队在晋绥地区同国民党反动派作过战。全国解放后，他在北京铁路管理局担任区工会副主席的工作。他认为像自己这样一个普通工人，过去既能完成党和人民交给的许多任务，这次也更加可以完成学习的任务。人们劝告他转学，他一点也不动摇。在学习过程中，他像从事其他工作一样，总是不断地研究改进学习方法，按照每天的学习程序编了一个科学的作业表，每一个程序里规定了应该采取的主要方法和达到的基本要求。对于一些必须记忆的东西，他写在一个小本子上，随身带着，一有空就拿出来阅读。他在学习上不但迅速消灭了不及格的现象，而且多数功课都获得五分。这次以优等总分毕业了。
    毕业前夕，铁道部副部长吕正操同这些老干部进行了座谈，勉励他们回到工作岗位上把所学的课堂知识同实践结合起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，依靠群众，在已经到来的技术革命、文化革命中做出更大的成绩来。
