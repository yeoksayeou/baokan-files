Using Local Materials, Making Do With What Is Available
Hunan Builds Two More Private Institutions of Higher Learning

(Our Newspaper, Reporter Kuang Luan) reported: Shortly after the establishment of the Zhuzhou Industrial College in early May, two more private institutions of higher learning emerged in Hunan: one is the Liling Agricultural College, and the other is the Liuyang Guandu Township Spare-time University. To date, there are three private institutions of higher learning in Hunan Province.

These two schools were established to prepare technical forces as early as possible for the continuous leap forward in agricultural production in the future, and based on the principles of using local materials and making do with what is available.

The Liling County Agricultural College has enrolled more than 110 students, many of whom are staff members of agencies and enterprises with equivalent high school qualifications, and members of agricultural cooperatives with junior high school education and considerable work experience. The teaching staff is temporarily composed of an associate professor, two lecturers, and six fourth-year students from Hunan Agricultural College who have been assigned to the county for labor training. The county party committee has also drawn several technicians from the Agricultural Bureau to participate in the school's work, teaching and learning at the same time. The curriculum temporarily includes agronomy and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, both of which are offered according to the needs of Liling's agricultural production development. The county party committee has also assigned scientific research topics to the school, such as how to improve Liling's soil.

The Liuyang Guandu Township Spare-time University has two classes of agricultural machinery specialty, etc., and is attached with one junior high school and one high school class. The subjects of study include Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and agricultural machinery, etc. Students can choose several according to their own aspirations and educational level. The teachers are cadres assigned to the township for training by the First Ministry of Machinery Industry. The students number 110 and are all cadres from nearby agencies and enterprises, primary school teachers, and workers and farmers.

    就地取材　因陋就简
    湖南又建两所民办高等学校
    本报讯　记者邝麓安报道：5月上旬，株洲工业专科学校成立不久，湖南又出现了两所民办高等学校：一所是醴陵农业专科学校，一所是浏阳官渡乡业余大学。至此，湖南省已有三所民办的高等学校。
    这两所学校都是为今后农业生产不断的跃进，及早准备技术力量，并根据就地取材、因陋就简的原则办起来的。
    醴陵县农业专科学校，共收有一百一十多个学生，其中有许多是具有高中同等学力的机关、企业工作人员和农业社具有初中文化水平、并经过相当时期劳动锻炼的社员。教师暂由湖南农学院下放到该县劳动锻炼的一位副教授、二位讲师和六位四年级学生担任，县委还从农业局抽了几个技术人员参加学校工作，边教边学。课程暂设农学和畜牧兽医两学科，都是根据醴陵农业生产发展的需要开设的。县委还给学校出了科学研究题目，如醴陵土壤如何改良等。
    浏阳官渡乡业余大学，有农业机械专科等二班，附设有初中、高中各一班，学习科目有语文、数学、物理、化学、生物及农业机械等，学员可根据自己志愿和文化水平选择几种。教师由中央第一机械工业部下放到该乡锻炼的干部担任，学员有一百一十人，都是附近机关、企业干部，小学教师和工人农民。
