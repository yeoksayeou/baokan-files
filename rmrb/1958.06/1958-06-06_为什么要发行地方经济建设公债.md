The State Council's proposal to discontinue the issuance of national economic construction bonds and allow local governments to issue local economic construction bonds has been approved by the 97th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This is a new measure taken by the state based on the unprecedented production and construction upsurge that has emerged throughout the country this year, in order to better solve the funding problems needed by various regions in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, and to further implement the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the unified leadership of the central government, developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously.

Issuing public bonds is one of the important methods for the state to raise construction funds. During the First Five-Year Plan period, starting in 1954, the state uniformly issued a certain amount of economic construction bonds every year. With the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country, the bond issuance plan was over-fulfilled every year, which played a certain role in raising construction funds and ensuring the smooth realization of the national economic construction plan. Continuing to issue economic construction bonds during the Second Five-Year Plan period to concentrate idle social funds to support economic construction is still of great significance. However, the work of issuing public bonds during the Second Five-Year Plan period will face a new situation. Since our country achieved a basic victory in terms of ownership in 1956, we have achieved great victories in the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement since last year, and the productive forces have been unprecedentedly liberated. On the other hand, the State Council has taken measures this year to improve the management system of industry, commerce, and finance, further resolving the division of labor between the central and local governments, greatly giving play to local initiative, and thus a high tide of production leaps forward has emerged across the country this year. In particular, the development of agriculture and local industry is even more prominent. For example, many provinces and cities have proposed to realize the tasks stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule in five or six years, and many provinces have proposed to make the total output value of local industry catch up with or exceed the total output value of agriculture in about five years. With the formation of a high tide of production and construction, it will inevitably bring further requirements for local governments to solve construction funds. Considering this new situation, the state has decided to stop issuing national bonds from 1959 and instead let local governments issue a type of local economic construction bond with smaller denominations and relatively shorter terms. This is very timely.

Issuing local economic construction bonds can raise funds according to local construction needs and the people's ability to purchase bonds, adapting measures to local conditions, without the need for the central government to set targets, avoiding situations where the allocated amount is too much or too little. For example, in areas where more funds are needed and the people have a higher ability to purchase bonds, more bonds can be issued appropriately, and in areas where less funds are needed, fewer bonds can also be issued; if construction funds have already been resolved by other methods (such as fiscal revenue, savings, personal investment, etc.), and there is no need to issue bonds for the time being, it can also be considered not to issue them temporarily. In this way, local governments are given greater maneuverability and flexibility, and construction funds can be arranged and used more rationally. Secondly, the funds raised through the issuance of local economic construction bonds will be mostly used for local industrial construction serving agricultural production. The characteristics of these local industrial constructions are that they require less investment and yield quick results. With small investments and very short periods of time, building small fertilizer plants, iron-smelting blast furnaces, coal-to-oil plants, farm tool repair and manufacturing plants, coal mines, and other industrial enterprises can directly promote the development of local industry and agriculture and meet the needs of the vast people for production and consumption, closely linking the issuance of public bonds with the economic interests of the local people. At the same time, it also specifically strengthens the concern and sense of responsibility of the masses of the people for the development of agriculture and the development of local industry. It is not difficult to see that if economic construction bonds are issued by local governments, it will better give play to local production enthusiasm and the enthusiasm of the masses of the people, which is also a good way to promote the development of socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Regarding the interest rate of local economic construction bonds, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has made new provisions in its decision: the annual interest rate should generally not exceed 2%, and interest-free bonds can also be issued. Perhaps some people will ask: Why is the interest rate of local public bonds lower than the interest rate of national public bonds (4% annual interest rate)? This is because the amount of public bonds purchased by most people each year is not large, and the repayment period of local economic construction bonds is also relatively short. Whether the interest rate is set higher or lower will not have any impact on their economic lives. For local governments, lowering the annual interest rate of public bonds can save some funds for paying interest and develop local industry faster, which is what the people are happy to see. In fact, in the past few years, people in various regions have continuously reflected that the interest rate of national economic construction bonds is set too high and advocated lowering it. This shows that the people across the country have clearly realized that subscribing to public bonds is a patriotic act and is in line with the long-term interests of the people.

The issuance of local economic construction bonds should also adhere to the principle of combining rational allocation with voluntary subscription. The issuance of local public bonds should be appropriate, and workers and peasants must not be made to suffer difficulties in their lives because of excessive subscription of public bonds. To this end, the relevant departments of each province, city, and autonomous region should strengthen investigation and research work as soon as possible, and formulate long-term plans for issuing public bonds based on the funds required for local economic construction and the people's ability to purchase public bonds. And at an appropriate time, conduct in-depth publicity to people of all strata, so that they understand the benefits and significance of issuing local economic construction bonds, and lay a solid foundation for the smooth progress of next year's public bond issuance work.

　　为什么要发行地方经济建设公债
    国务院关于停发国家经济建设公债允许地方政府发行地方经济建设公债的议案，已经全国人民代表大会常委会第九十七次会议通过。这是国家根据今年在全国范围内出现了一个规模空前的生产建设高潮，为了更好地解决各地在社会主义建设大跃进中所需要的资金问题，进一步贯彻执行在中央统一领导下发展工业和发展农业同时并举、发展中央工业和发展地方工业同时并举、大型企业中型企业和小型企业同时并举的方针而采取的一项新的措施。
    发行公债是国家筹集建设资金的重要方法之一。在第一个五年计划期间，从1954年开始，国家每年都统一发行了一定数量的经济建设公债，在全国人民爱国主义的热情支持下，年年都超额完成了公债发行计划，这对于筹集建设资金，保证国家经济建设计划的顺利实现，起了一定的作用。在第二个五年计划期间继续发行经济建设公债，以集中社会闲散资金支援经济建设，仍然具有重要意义。但是第二个五年计划期间的公债发行工作将面临着一个新的形势。我们国家自从1956年在所有制方面取得基本胜利以后，去年以来又在反右派斗争和全民整风运动方面取得了伟大的胜利，生产力得到空前解放；另一方面，国务院今年又在改进工业、商业、财政的管理体制方面采取了措施，进一步解决了中央和地方分工问题，大大发挥了地方积极性，因而今年在全国出现了生产大跃进的高潮。其中特别是农业和地方工业的发展更为突出，例如许多省、市都提出用五、六年的时间提前实现农业发展纲要规定的任务，不少省份提出要在五年左右的时间内使地方工业总产值赶上或超过农业总产值。随着生产建设高潮的形成，必然会给地方带来进一步解决建设资金的要求。国家考虑到这一新的形势，决定自1959年起停止发行全国性的公债，改由地方政府发行一种票额较小的、比较短期的地方经济建设公债，这是非常适合时宜的。
    发行地方经济建设公债，可以根据当地建设需要和人民购买公债的能力，因地制宜地筹集资金，而不必由中央规定指标，避免造成分配数额过多或过少的情况。例如在需要资金较多、人民购买公债能力较高的地区，就可适当多发行一些公债，在对资金需要较少的地区也可以少发行一些；如果用其它方法（如财政收入、储蓄、个人投资等）已经解决了建设资金问题，而一时还不需要发行公债的地方也可以考虑暂不发行。这样，就给地方以较大的机动性和灵活性，可以更加合理地统筹安排和使用建设资金。其次，通过发行地方经济建设公债筹集的资金，将大部分用于当地为农业生产服务的工业建设。进行这些地方工业建设的特点是投资较少，收效很快。用不大的投资和很短的时间，建设一些小型的化肥厂、炼铁高炉、煤炼油厂、农具修造厂、煤矿等工业企业，就能直接促进当地工农业的发展和满足广大人民生产和消费的需要，使公债的发行和当地人民的经济利益紧密结合起来。同时也就具体地加强了人民群众对发展农业和发展地方工业的关心和责任感。不难看出，经济建设公债由地方政府发行，就会更好地发挥地方的生产积极性，发挥人民群众的积极性，这也是多快好省地促进社会主义建设事业发展的一个好方法。
    关于地方经济建设公债的利率问题，人大常委会在决定中作了新的规定：年利一般不宜超过2％，也可以发行无息公债。也许有人会问：为什么地方公债比国家公债的利率（年利率4％）低了呢？这是因为大多数群众每年购买公债的数额都不算多，而且地方经济建设公债偿还期限也比较短。利率定得高一些或低一些对他们的经济生活根本不会发生什么影响。而对地方政府来说，把公债年利定低一些，就可以剩出一部分用于支付利息的资金，更快地发展地方工业，这是人民所乐意的。事实上，过去几年来各地人民已经不断反映国家经济建设公债利率定得高了，主张降低一些，这说明全国人民已经认识清楚，认购公债是一种爱国行为，是符合人民长远利益的。
    发行地方经济建设公债，同样应该掌握合理分配与自愿认购相结合的原则。地方公债的发行量应该适当，绝不能让工人、农民因为认购公债过多而造成他们生活上的困难。为此各省、市、自治区有关部门应该及早加强调查研究工作，根据本地区经济建设所需资金情况和人民购买公债能力，作出发行公债的长远规划。并且在适当时候对各阶层人民进行深入的宣传，使他们懂得发行地方经济建设公债的好处和意义，为明年的发行公债工作的顺利进行打好基础。
