　　Introducing Gu Yuan's Murals
　　Guo Jun

　　Eighteen years ago, the artist Gu Yuan was sent to Nianzhuang in Yan'an. In the countryside, he created many woodcuts, such as "The People's Liu Zhidan" and "Brother's Vacation," whose profound and vivid images are still etched in our minds. Now, the artist Gu Yuan has been sent to the countryside of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, where, in addition to actively participating in labor, he has painted dozens of murals. These murals have greatly encouraged the farmers in their local production Great Leap Forward. Recently, the Tianjin Fine Arts Publishing House compiled and selected thirty-two of these murals, entitled "Rural Mural Templates," for publication, which should be said to be a joyous event in the art world.

　　The people of Hebei Province, in the midst of the socialist Great Leap Forward, have issued the bold slogan "We must turn our hometowns into mural provinces, mural counties, and mural villages!" Some of these aspirations have already been realized. Huai'an County in Hebei Province alone has 9,990 murals, with an average of one mural for every five households. This kind of mass artistic creation activity is truly an unprecedented miracle. But how can this artistic movement be promoted to rural areas across the country? How can professional art workers participate in this work to help farmers improve the quality of their creations? These are all urgent problems to be solved. Gu Yuan's mural creation is an example of how to solve these problems. He uses the greatest political enthusiasm to depict the reality of today's countryside. Look! The vigorous technological and cultural revolutions have begun in the countryside. The farmers are fighting against nature. In the twentieth picture, "The mountains are rushing, the river is overflowing, but we still have the final say. Tell it to rise, it dares not lower; tell it to go, it dares not stop; tell it to generate electricity, it generates electricity," Gu Yuan depicts a farmer locking up a "dragon" and leading it away (see attached picture). The image on the screen can give people a strong confidence to overcome difficulties and conquer nature. "Dragon" is a familiar legend to the masses for thousands of years. Its appearance on the screen does not make us feel stiff or uncoordinated with real life. On the contrary, the interesting image on the screen gives us an optimistic mood.

　　These murals reflect a wide range of life, from accumulating fertilizer to electrification, from opposing conservative thinking to the communist style. In each painting, Gu Yuan has created very vivid images. Looking at the characters he paints, one feels very親切. The entire mural maintains its decorative and folk characteristics, and each one is accompanied by a folk song-style slogan, making it a true "pastoral poem painting." For example, the lyrics of the fifteenth picture are "A piece of green forest, a piece of flowers, the most beautiful place in the world is our home. Not afraid of wind and sand, not afraid of drought, we harvest good crops every year." The tenth picture says "Thousands of pounds per mu depends on three things: sweet potatoes, corn, and sorghum. Three harvests will make a good year, crossing the Yellow River and crossing the Yangtze River." These poems and paintings vividly introduce the farmers' wishes to the audience. They can not only be used for copying murals, but also serve as an educational work of art for appreciation.

　　介绍古元的壁画
　　郭钧
    十八年前，画家古元曾下放到延安的念庄。在农村，他创作了许多木刻，如“人民的刘志丹”、“哥哥的假期”等，那些深刻而鲜明的形象，至今还嵌在我们心里。现在，画家古元又下放到河北省遵化县的农村中去了，他在乡下除了积极参加劳动外，并画了几十幅壁画。这些壁画在配合当地的生产大跃进上，给农民很大的鼓舞。最近由天津美术出版社编选了其中的三十二幅订名为“农村壁画范本”出版了，这应该说是美术界一件喜事。
    河北省人民在社会主义大跃进中，都曾发出豪迈的口号“要使自己的家乡变成壁画省，壁画县，壁画乡！”这些志愿有的都已实现了。河北省怀安县一县就有壁画九千九百九十幅，平均五户就有壁画一幅，这种群众性的美术创作活动真是史无前例的奇迹。但如何把这种美术运动推广到全国农村中去？专业的美术工作者如何参与这项工作，以帮助农民提高创作的质量？这些都是急待解决的问题。古元的壁画创作，就是解决这些问题的范例。他用最大的政治热情去描绘今天农村的现实。请看吧！蓬勃的技术革命和文化革命在农村中开始了。农民们在向大自然进行斗争，在第二十图“山水急，河水漫，还得咱们说了算，叫他高，不敢低，叫它走，不敢站，叫它发电就发电，”一画里，古元画着一个农民把“龙”锁起来牵着走（附图）。画面上的形象能使人产生一种能够战胜困难征服自然的坚强信心。“龙”是几千年来群众熟悉的传说，它出现在画面上，我们并没有感到生硬或与现实生活不协调，正相反画面上有趣的形象给我们一种乐观主义的情绪。
    这些壁画反映的生活很广泛，从积肥到电气化，从反对保守思想到共产主义的风格，古元在每一幅画里大都创造出很生动的形象。看了他所画的人物，使人感到很亲切。整个壁画保持着装饰性和民间特色，加上每幅都配上一首民歌式的标语，真是一本“田园诗画”。如第十五图的词是“一片绿林一片花，天下最美是咱家，不怕风沙不怕旱，年年收割好庄稼”，第十图的“亩产千斤靠三样，白薯玉米和高粱，三样丰收年景好，渡过黄河跨长江”，这些诗画把农民的愿望形象地介绍给观众，不但可作临摹壁画之用，同时也是一本有教育意义的美术欣赏品。
