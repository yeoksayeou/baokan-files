Actively Solve the Vegetable Consumption Problem in Small Towns, New Industrial and Mining Areas, and Construction Sites
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

In recent years, the vegetable supply work in major cities and industrial and mining areas has achieved great success due to the attention of local Party and government leading organs and the correct implementation of the policy of "local production, local supply, city-wide zoning, and basic self-sufficiency." Vegetable production has increased significantly. The replanting area of vegetables in 100 large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas across the country reached 4.45 million mu last year, and the vegetable planting area this year will increase by 35% compared to last year. The increase in vegetable production has greatly improved the supply situation, and retail prices have generally fallen compared to last year. The majority of urban residents are generally satisfied with being able to regularly eat fresh and inexpensive vegetables. Therefore, it can be said that the vegetable supply problem in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas has been basically solved.

However, a new situation worthy of attention has emerged in the current vegetable supply work. It is prominently manifested in the fact that the vegetable supply in some small county towns, new industrial and mining areas, and new construction sites is more strained than in large and medium-sized cities, and vegetable prices are generally higher than in large cities. For example, in some county towns in the Yichang Special District of Hubei, the supply of Chinese cabbage was insufficient in the first quarter of this year. In Yidu County, Shandong Province, a vegetable-producing province, the retail price of Chinese cabbage this spring was 50% higher per jin than in large cities. An abnormal phenomenon of vegetables flowing from cities to market towns has occurred in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province. On some water conservancy construction sites, people have even been unable to eat vegetables for long periods. The insufficient vegetable supply in small towns has affected the lives of the masses and also affected their labor efficiency. It can be seen that solving the vegetable supply problem in small towns and construction sites is a major problem that needs to be solved urgently.

Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, a vigorous upsurge in agricultural and industrial production is sweeping the country. Countless inspiring construction projects are emerging every day; local industries are blooming everywhere; and local farmland water conservancy projects are developing vigorously at an unprecedented speed. This situation has led to a rapid concentration of population in small towns, and the large concentration of labor has inevitably raised the issue of supplying vegetables to commercial departments. These are all new situations that have emerged after the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and they are also the root cause of the tight vegetable supply in small towns and construction sites.

Faced with this new situation, the vegetable supply work cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas. A new requirement and a new task must be put forward, that is, "wherever there is a construction site, there are vegetables to eat," and "wherever a factory is opened, vegetables are planted." In the past, people said: "Before the troops move, food and fodder go first." Now our proposition is, "Before the project moves, vegetables go first." All construction undertakings in our country must be done by people, and the necessary material basis for ensuring people's production and labor is grain and vegetables. This is a principle that many people easily understand, and it is obviously not feasible to only pay attention to construction without solving people's necessary material needs. Therefore, the problem of vegetable supply in every small county town, construction site, and new industrial and mining area must be solved quickly.

Experience has shown that solving the vegetable supply is not a very difficult task. As long as the Party and government leaders in various places seriously arrange vegetable production while planning various construction projects, the problem can be quickly solved. Therefore, the problem is not how difficult it is to solve the vegetable supply itself, but that many small county towns or emerging industrial and mining areas often neglect the "radish and cabbage" problem when they are busy with various central tasks, or believe that the population is small in small county towns and the demand is small, so they have not been concerned about it in the past, and have not put this issue on the agenda it deserves. This understanding is obviously far behind the development of the situation. Some emerging industrial and mining areas have already achieved great success in this regard. The Pangjiabao mining area in northern Zhangjiakou was unable to meet local needs with its vegetable production last year, and had to transfer large quantities of vegetables from other places every year, which was not only an unreliable supply but also very expensive. At the end of last year, the local Party and government leaders tackled this issue, so that even though the area is located more than 1,000 meters above sea level and the conditions for growing vegetables are very poor, vegetable production has rapidly expanded more than tenfold, and this year it can achieve self-sufficiency. The "National Agricultural Development Program" basically adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China stipulates: "Cooperatives and state-owned farms in urban suburbs and near industrial and mining areas should plant vegetables according to the state plan to fully ensure the supply of vegetables in cities and industrial and mining areas." The cities mentioned here refer to large, medium, and small cities, not just large cities; the industrial and mining areas mentioned here refer to all industrial and mining areas, not just old industrial and mining areas; the cooperatives and state-owned farms mentioned here planting vegetables according to the state plan means to fully guarantee the supply, not a small amount of supply. We hope that Party and government leaders, commercial departments, and agricultural departments in various places will conscientiously plan and arrange the vegetable production and supply issues in small towns and new industrial and mining areas in accordance with this spirit, and strive to change the tight vegetable supply situation in small towns and new industrial and mining areas in the shortest possible time, so that the broad masses of working people can eat fresh, delicious, and inexpensive vegetables, and so that millions of the labor army can be healthy and energetic in carrying out socialist construction.

    积极解决小城镇、新工矿区和建设工地的吃菜问题
    本报评论员
    近年来，各大中城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应工作，由于各地党、政领导机关的重视和正确地贯彻了“就近生产，就近供应，按城划片，基本自给”的方针，取得了很大成绩。蔬菜的生产有了显著的增长，全国一百个大中城市和工矿区去年蔬菜复种面积已达四百四十五万亩，今年的蔬菜种植面积还要比去年增加35％。蔬菜产量的增加，就使得供应情况有了很大的改善，零售价格也比去年普遍下降。广大城市居民能够经常吃到新鲜而又价格便宜的蔬菜，都普遍感到满意。因此，大中城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应问题可以说基本上是解决了的。
    但是，当前蔬菜的供应工作却也出现了值得注意的新情况。突出地表现在若干小县城、新的工矿区和新的工地上蔬菜的供应却比大中城市来得紧张，蔬菜价格一般也都比大城市偏高。例如湖北宜昌专区某些县城今年一季度大白菜都供应不足；在产菜省的山东益都县，今春大白菜的零售价格每斤却要高于大城市50％；辽宁省辽阳县已经发生蔬菜从城市倒流集镇的不正常现象；在一些兴修水利的工地上，人们甚至长时期吃不到蔬菜。小城镇蔬菜供应不足的情况影响了广大群众生活，也影响了他们的劳动效率。可见解决小城镇和工地蔬菜供应问题，是当前急待解决的一个重大问题。
    在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，一方面举国上下正在掀起一个热火朝天的工农业生产大跃进的建设高潮。数不清的振奋人心的各项建设工程每天都在大量涌现出来；地方工业遍地开花；地方兴修农田水利的工程更是以空前的速度蓬勃发展。这种情况使得小城镇的人口迅速集中了，而劳动力的大量集中，也必然向商业部门提出了供应蔬菜的问题。这些，都是工农业生产大跃进以后出现的新情况，也是造成小城镇和工地蔬菜供应紧张的根本原因。
    面临着这个新的形势，蔬菜供应工作就不能只满足于大中城市工矿区已有的成绩。还必须提出这样一个新的要求，新的任务，这就是“那里有工地，那里有菜吃”，“那里开工厂，那里就种菜”。过去人们说：“兵马未动，粮草先行”，现在我们的主张是，“工程未动，蔬菜先行”。我们国家的各项建设事业，都必须是要人来做，保证人们生产劳动的必须的物质基础是粮食和蔬菜，这是许多人容易了解的道理，只注意搞建设而不解决人们必需的物质需要显然是不行的。因此，必须迅速地解决每个小县城，工地，新的工矿区蔬菜供应的问题。
    经验证明：解决蔬菜供应不是什么十分困难的事。只要各地党政领导认真的在规划各项建设的同时，对蔬菜的生产加以安排，问题就可以很快的得到解决。因此，问题不在于解决蔬菜供应的本身有多少困难，问题在于许多小县城，或新兴工矿区常常在忙于各项中心工作时，把“萝卜白菜”的问题忽视了，或者在小县城里认为人口少，需要数量小，过去一直是没有管过的，而没有把这个问题摆到应有的议事日程上来。这种认识，显然是远远落后于形势发展的后面了。有些新兴工矿区在这方面已经取得了很大的成绩。张家口北部的庞家堡矿区，去年的蔬菜生产远不能满足当地的需要，每年要从外地调入大批蔬菜，不仅供应没有保证而且价格很高。去年年底，当地党政领导抓了这件事，因而虽然地处海拔一千公尺以上，种植蔬菜的条件很不好，但蔬菜生产还是迅速地扩大了十倍以上，今年就可做到自给。最近中共八大第二次会议基本上通过的农业发展纲要中规定：“城市郊区和工矿区附近的合作社和国营农场，应当按照国家的计划种植蔬菜，充分地保证城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应。”这里说的城市是指大、中、小城市而不是只限于大城市；这里所说的工矿区是指一切的工矿区而不是只限于老的工矿区；这里讲的合作社和国营农场按照国家计划种蔬菜，说的是要充分保证供应而不是少量供应。我们希望各地党政领导、商业部门、农业部门都要根据这一精神认真地规划和安排小城镇和新工矿区的蔬菜生产和供应问题，争取在最短的时间内，改变小城镇和新工矿区蔬菜供应紧张的局面，让广大劳动群众吃到新鲜可口而又价格低廉的蔬菜，让千百万劳动大军能够身体健康，精神百倍地进行社会主义建设。
