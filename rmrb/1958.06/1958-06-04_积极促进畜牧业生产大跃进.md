　　Actively Promote a Great Leap Forward in Livestock Production
　　Deputy Minister of Agriculture Cai Ziwei
    Under the glorious illumination of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, China's industrial and agricultural production and various construction projects have seen an unprecedented new situation of leaping forward. With the vigorous development of the agricultural production upsurge, China's animal husbandry must also develop greatly and leap forward, in order to support agricultural production more powerfully with power and fertilizer, and to rapidly increase livestock products such as meat, oil, eggs, milk, and fur, to support socialist industrial construction and meet the needs of the continuous improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of people.
    Livestock Production Growth
    Since liberation, China's livestock production has grown significantly. The number of various livestock compared with each period is as follows: (Comparison table attached after the article)
    From the comparison table, in terms of large and small livestock, both have exceeded the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan; compared with before liberation, the increase is even greater, especially the rapid development of pigs from last summer to the present. Taking the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan as an example, large livestock increased by 9.7% in 1957 compared to 1952. The net increase rate of draft animals in these years is very low, which cannot meet the needs of agricultural production development. Especially after 1954, large livestock once declined. Except for pigs, large livestock and sheep did not complete the targets of the First Five-Year Plan.
    In terms of livestock improvement, since liberation, 350,000 improved hybrid horses and 2.7 million improved sheep have been produced. This speed is also too slow for China's agricultural development and national economic needs.
    Since last year, due to the strengthening of leadership by the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, this situation has changed greatly. Livestock production is showing a significant improvement and moving towards a climax. Except for individual areas, the abnormal mortality of large livestock has basically stopped, the physique of livestock has improved, and the management system of cooperatives for livestock has been sound and strengthened. In particular, this year's breeding work has seen a more prominent transformation than last year. Many places have established improved breeding bases, added artificial insemination stations, and many cooperatives have increased breeding sires and established breeding stations. As a result, many livestock-rich counties and livestock-rich societies have emerged in various places. Weinan County in Shaanxi Province, Dongliu in Anhui Province, Pu County in Shanxi Province, Pingxiang in Hebei Province, Changtu in Liaoning Province, and Hailun in Heilongjiang Province all achieved basic full pregnancy of eligible breeding females last year. This year, more than 100 counties have proposed full pregnancy of breeding females, striving to achieve "four completes" (i.e., all eligible breeding females are bred, all are pregnant, all give birth, and all foals survive). The number of pigs increased by more than 50 million in one year last year. By the end of March this year, it had reached more than 163.3 million, an increase of more than 19 million compared to the end of 1957. These facts are all exciting. However, the development is uneven. Some places are still deserted, and they do not grasp livestock production enough and lack due attention.
  To have high-yield agriculture, there must be high-yield animal husbandry
    Originally, animal husbandry and agriculture are interdependent and mutually supportive. To have stable and high-yield agriculture, there must be stable and high-yield animal husbandry. Just taking fertilizer as an example, Zunhua County in Hebei Province raised 400,000 pigs in 1957, more than double the number in 1952. Due to the increase in pig raising and manure accumulation, the unit area yield of grain has correspondingly increased. In 1957, the average yield per mu was 430 jin, an increase of 96% compared to 1952. In the future, the supply of chemical fertilizers will greatly increase. But this does not reduce the importance of farm manure. The experience of all countries proves that chemical fertilizers must be combined with farm manure at any time, and the effective way to increase farm organic fertilizer is to vigorously develop animal husbandry. Some places and some cadres have the idea of simply waiting for mechanization and not paying attention to breeding draft animals, so the current breeding work for draft animals has not been carried out well. As Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out in his explanation of the Agricultural Development Program at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, "If mechanization is overemphasized in the countryside now, it may attract the attention of the masses to waiting for mechanization, and they may relax their efforts on the improvement of agricultural tools, semi-mechanization, and breeding and improving draft animals, which are the quickest to take effect. This should also be noted." At present, China mainly promotes the improvement of agricultural tools and implements semi-mechanization; the large-scale promotion of double-wheeled double-share plows urgently requires vigorous breeding and improvement of draft animals; especially after the great leap forward in agriculture, water conservancy, a large increase in fertilizer, and an increase in grain output, the demand for livestock in water carts and transportation has greatly increased. Even in some places where mechanization can be implemented in advance, due to the original lack of draft animals, the simultaneous development of machinery and animal power is needed for a considerable period of time to meet the needs of agricultural production. In addition, fur animals and poultry provide raw materials such as leather and wool for industry, which especially need to adapt to the development of industry. At present, about 80% of the raw materials for China's wool textile industry depend on imports, which shows that China's sheep urgently need to be greatly improved and bred in order to catch up with the needs of the existing industrial level.
    From the perspective of the comprehensive development of agriculture and animal husbandry, as well as the requirements of industry for livestock production, China's animal husbandry is indeed a relatively weak link in the entire national economy. Since the new upsurge of agricultural production was launched last winter, livestock production has begun to show a rising trend, which is a good start. We must continue to go all out and make unremitting efforts to accelerate and massively breed large livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys, as well as small livestock such as pigs, sheep, and rabbits, and various poultry, and strive to achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program for the development of animal husbandry ahead of schedule.
  Livestock breeding rate can be greatly improved
    Can the current breeding rate of livestock be greatly improved? The answer is affirmative. As long as we overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, strengthen leadership, and take various specific measures, the breeding rate of livestock can be greatly improved. Countless advanced examples in various places have fully proved this point. Taking yellow cattle as an example, in 1957, 182 of the 855 agricultural societies in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, had a 100% breeding rate of breeding females, 17 societies achieved a 100% conception rate for each breeding, 433 societies achieved a 100% survival rate for each birth, and 32 societies achieved "four completes." The breeding rate of water buffaloes was generally considered to be low in the past, but the Xinjian Agricultural Society in Dongliu County, Anhui, created a very high record. In 1956, the society had 84 breeding females, giving birth to 51 calves, with a breeding rate of 60%; in 1957, it had 95 breeding females, giving birth to 87 calves, with a breeding rate of 90%. Taking Longjiang County in Heilongjiang Province as an example for horses, in 1957, the county had a total of 19,061 breeding mares, of which 12,910 were conceived, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of eligible breeding mares, and the conception rate increased by 16% compared to 1956. In terms of sheep, the net increase rate of sheep and goats in Zhidan County, Shaanxi Province in 1957 was 22%. Yanshan County in Hebei Province had only more than 30,000 sheep in 1953, but reached 104,000 by the end of 1957. The increase of more than two times in four years is not slow. As for pig production, due to the Party's vigorous efforts, there has been a leap forward from last year to the present. The above all show that the potential for livestock development is great, and it is entirely possible to accelerate the increase in the net breeding rate and increase the number of heads on a large scale. We must overcome right-leaning conservative thinking in livestock production, resolutely implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and organize a great leap forward in livestock production to launch a comprehensive upsurge in agricultural and animal husbandry production.
        Four Fundamental Measures
    In order to realize the great leap forward in livestock production, work hard for three years to change the face of China's animal husbandry, overfulfill the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan, and realize the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program for animal husbandry ahead of schedule, and truly establish a socialist animal husbandry in China with a large number, good quality, many varieties, high breeding rate, and high livestock products, we must focus on the following fundamental measures:
    1. Actively carry out livestock breeding and improvement work: First of all, we must vigorously carry out this year's spring breeding campaign. Only by breeding more this year can we produce more next year, and lay the foundation for great development in the next few years. While breeding, we must grasp the improvement of livestock breeds and improve livestock physique. This requires that all male and female livestock must be well-fed and not overused, so as to promote normal estrus in female livestock and enhance the breeding performance of sires. In addition, it is necessary to solve the current problem of insufficient breeding livestock. The most economical and effective method is to rely on the masses and agricultural societies to select seeds locally and breed locally, and mobilize each agricultural society to retain breeding livestock to ensure the completion of the livestock breeding plan. Only in this way can we achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It is necessary to introduce foreign or foreign high-quality breeding livestock in a planned way, but it can only play an auxiliary role. Relying solely on imported breeding livestock will inevitably result in less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. All localities should establish improved breeding stations to guide agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives to do a good job in seed selection and breeding. At the same time, breeding bases should be established in a planned way in the existing breeding livestock producing areas, such as the Nanyang cattle, Sanhe horse, Ili horse, Dingxian pig, Jinhua pig, and Xinjiang wool-meat dual-purpose fine-wool sheep producing areas, which can be vigorously developed and become bases for supplying breeding livestock to various places. These excellent varieties can be vigorously promoted, but these excellent varieties alone are not enough. The work of selecting and retaining breeding livestock and cultivating improved varieties must also be carried out by everyone, blooming everywhere. In addition to relying on improved breeding bases and state-owned breeding farms, the more important thing is to implement the policy of self-breeding, self-raising, and self-improvement, relying on cooperatives to cultivate breeding livestock themselves and carry out cross-breeding improvement of livestock. The necessary adjustment work between regions is extremely necessary in the current situation of unbalanced livestock development. We must closely cooperate with the Second Commercial Department to make overall arrangements and do a good job in livestock adjustment in a planned way.
    2. Seriously and systematically develop feed production. Forage and feed are the material basis for ensuring that livestock are numerous and of good quality. To put livestock development on a solid foundation, we must give great importance and serious arrangements to these fundamental measures. While formulating livestock production development plans, we must make corresponding feed production plans, so that for every livestock bred, a portion of feed will be produced at the same time. First of all, we must use substitute feed in large quantities, use less concentrate and more roughage; vigorously promote silage corn stalks, peanut vines, wild grass, as well as the preparation of various fermented feeds, alkalized wheat straw, rice straw and other methods. At the same time, to make livestock feed well and grow fast, a certain amount of concentrate is indeed needed. It is necessary to make full use of grain by-products, and organize agricultural societies in various places to make full use of barren slopes, vacant land, summer and autumn fallow land, and reserve a certain area of cultivated land under possible conditions to plant high-yield feed crops in a planned way. Pastoral areas should vigorously manage grasslands, actively develop water sources, develop grassland water conservancy, solve the problem of water for people and animals, and achieve abundant water and grass; implement zonal rotational grazing and sealing beach to cultivate grass, actively eliminate pests and animal hazards, remove miscellaneous wood and harmful grass, fertilize in necessary places, and supplement grass sowing to expand the utilization rate of grasslands and increase the carrying capacity of grasslands. And we must do a good job in settling nomadic work, establishing feed bases, and planting concentrate feed.
    3. Actively prevent and control livestock diseases. During our First Five-Year Plan period, we have basically eliminated rinderpest, which is a great victory in China's livestock disease prevention and control work. During the Second Five-Year Plan, we must use the greatest force to first eliminate hog cholera, and at the same time, we must also basically eliminate or control the spread of serious epidemic diseases such as chicken plague, bovine pleuropneumonia, equine glanders, foot-and-mouth disease, porcine cysticercosis, sheep pox, bovine mange, and livestock schistosomiasis, so as to achieve the provisions of the Agricultural Development Program. The most fundamental way is to rely on the masses and implement the policy of prevention over treatment into the livestock production activities of each cooperative. At present, many cooperatives have established their own veterinary clinics, trained pig doctors and cattle doctors, and established a rational feeding management system, which has laid a good foundation for the prevention and control of livestock diseases. Hog cholera attenuated live vaccine is simple to manufacture, has great effect, and is cheap. Many regions have adopted the method of manufacturing on-site and supplying it in time, which is very popular among the masses and should be vigorously promoted. Chicken plague vaccine is also a reagent that is simple to manufacture and has a quick effect. Many provinces and regions are training a large number of vaccine manufacturing personnel and proposing plans to eliminate chicken plague in three to five years, which is very good. The current task in this regard is to actively promote advanced experiences in various places, help agricultural societies train epidemic prevention personnel, effectively organize the use of folk veterinarians, strengthen the production and supply of veterinary medicines and equipment, and do a good job in quarantine work.
    4. Strengthen scientific research in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. China has a long tradition of operating animal husbandry, and has accumulated many valuable experiences among the masses. The scientific heritage of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine in the motherland and the experience of the masses must be actively systematically sorted out and summarized, so that it can shine in the development of China's socialist animal husbandry; at the same time, it must also be further developed on the basis of modern science. Our work in this area is still very weak. The animal husbandry and veterinary medicine departments of various higher agricultural colleges should be established and enriched, and the teaching of animal husbandry specialty courses in various secondary agricultural schools should also be strengthened. Animal husbandry and veterinary medicine scientific research institutions should strengthen experimental research work. In cultivating and improving varieties, preventing and controlling epidemic diseases, manufacturing biological drugs, etc., we must seriously summarize the advanced experiences of the masses, combine them with China's actual situation, absorb foreign scientific research results, and boldly create, and overcome the serious bourgeois ideology and dogmatism existing in some animal husbandry and veterinary medicine scientific research units and personnel who only study foreign countries and not their own countries, pay attention to ostentation, seek grandeur, and are divorced from the countryside and reality, so as to rapidly develop China's animal husbandry and veterinary medicine science and make it a powerful weapon to promote the great leap forward in livestock production.
    Adapting to the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and developing animal husbandry at high speed, China has extremely favorable conditions. China is located in the temperate zone, with vast grasslands and mountainous and water areas, which are excellent natural conditions for the most extensive feed base and the growth of rich and diverse forage and feed. With the leap forward in grain production, the increase in unit area yield and total output of grain and feed crops, and the growth of all agricultural and sideline products, feeding conditions will be greatly improved, giving animal husbandry a solid and reliable foundation. China's large and small livestock, poultry and various fur animals have many excellent and rare varieties, which makes our livestock improvement work exceptionally superior conditions. China has a large population, both with sufficient labor and a vast domestic market. Chinese farmers have a historical tradition and habit of operating animal husbandry and have accumulated many valuable experiences. Especially after cooperativization, under the incomparably superior socialist production relations and social system, the productive forces have been unprecedentedly liberated. With the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production, the masses' demands and enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry have also increased unprecedentedly. We fully believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and earnestly implementing the general policy and general line of socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, China's animal husbandry can break with convention and develop at high speed. Within the Second Five-Year Plan, we have full confidence in realizing the requirements stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. After another ten years or so, China's livestock production will surpass the level of all capitalist countries like agriculture, and become a country with the most and best livestock and livestock products in the world with highly developed animal husbandry.

　　积极促进畜牧业生产大跃进
　　农业部副部长  蔡子伟
    在党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国工农业生产及各项建设都出现了史无前例的飞跃前进的崭新形势，随着农业生产高潮的蓬勃发展，我国畜牧业也必须大发展大跃进，以便从动力和肥料上更有力地支援农业生产，并迅速增加肉、油、蛋、奶、皮毛等畜产品，支援社会主义工业建设和满足广大人民生活水平不断提高的需要。
    畜牧业生产增长情况
    解放以来，我国畜牧业生产有了很大的增长，各种牲畜数与各时期比较有如下情况：（比较表附文后）
    从比较表来看，在大小牲畜方面，都超过了抗日战争前最高水平；如与解放前比较，增加的数量更大，特别是生猪由去年夏季到现在，更有飞跃的发展。以第一个五年计划执行情况来看，1957年比1952年大牲畜增加9.7％。这几年耕畜的净增率很低，不能适应农业生产发展的需要。尤其在1954年以后，大牲畜曾经有一度下降，除生猪外，大牲畜和羊都未完成第一个五年计划指标。
    在牲畜改良方面，解放以来改良的杂种马三十五万匹，羊二百七十万只。以我国农业发展及国民经济的需要来说，也显得速度太慢了。
    这种情况，由去年到现在，由于中央及各级党委加强了领导，已起了很大变化，畜牧业生产正在出现一个显著好转和走向高潮的局面。除个别地区外，大牲畜不正常死亡现象基本停止了，牲畜体质好转，合作社对牲畜的管理制度健全和加强了，特别今年配种繁殖工作比去年更有突出的转变。不少地方建立了良种基地，增设了人工授精站，很多合作社增加了种公畜，建立了配种站，因而各地出现了不少牲畜丰产县、丰产社。陕西省渭南县、安徽省东流、山西省蒲县、河北省平乡、辽宁省昌图、黑龙江省海伦等县，去年都达到了适龄母畜基本满怀。今年有一百多个县提出母畜满怀，争取作到“四全”（即适龄母畜全部配种，全部怀胎，全部产仔，幼驹全部成活）。生猪去年一年内增加五千余万头。到今年3月底已达一亿六千三百多万头，比1957年底又增加一千九百多万头。这些事实都是令人兴奋的。但发展情况是不平衡的，有的地方仍然是冷冷清清，对畜牧业抓的不够，缺乏应有的重视。
  要有高产的农业，必须有高产的畜牧业
    本来畜牧业与农业是互相依存、互相支援的，要有稳定高产的农业就必须有稳定高产的畜牧业，仅就肥料一项举个例子来说，河北省遵化县1957年养猪四十万头，比1952年增加一倍以上，由于养猪多，积肥多，粮食单位面积产量相应提高，1957年每亩平均四百三十斤，比1952年增加96％。今后化学肥料的供应量将要大大增加。但这并不减少农家肥料的重要性。各国的经验都证明，任何时候化学肥料都要和农家肥料结合施用，而增加农家有机质肥料的有效方法，就是大力发展畜牧业。也有的地方、有的干部，有单纯等待机械化，不注意繁殖耕畜的想法，因而目前耕畜配种工作开展得不好。诚如谭震林同志在党的八大二次会议上关于农业发展纲要的说明中所指出的“现在在农村中如果过多强调机械化，可能把群众的注意力吸引到等待机械化，而对于眼前见效最快的农具改良、半机械化和繁殖改良耕畜放松了努力，这也要注意。”我国目前主要是推行改良农具，实行半机械化；双轮双铧犁的大量推广，迫切需要大力繁殖和改良耕畜；尤其在农业大跃进、水利化、肥料大量增加和粮食产量增加以后，在拉水车、运输方面牲畜的需要量，更大大的增加了。就是在某些可以先一步实行机械化的地方，由于原来役畜就不充足，在相当长的时期内，也需要机械和畜力同时发展，才能满足农业生产的需要。此外，皮毛兽和家禽为工业提供皮革、毛绒等原料，尤其需要与工业的发展相适应。目前我国毛纺工业的原料，有80％左右依赖进口，这说明我国的羊只极需大力进行改良和繁殖，才能赶上现有工业水平的需要。
    从农牧业全面发展，以及工业对畜牧生产的要求来看，我国的牧畜业在整个国民经济中的确是一个比较薄弱的环节，自从去冬掀起新的农业生产高潮以来，畜牧生产开始出现了高涨的形势，这是一个良好的开端。还必须继续鼓足干劲，坚持不懈地努力，加速地大量地繁殖牛、马、骡、驴等大家畜和猪、羊、兔等小家畜以及各种家禽，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要关于发展畜牧业的要求。
  牲畜繁殖率能大大提高
    目前牲畜的繁殖率能否大大的提高呢？答复是肯定的，只要克服右倾保守思想，加强领导，采取各项具体措施，牲畜的繁殖率即可大大的提高，各地无数先进的事例都充分证明了这一点。以黄牛来说，陕西省渭南县1957年全县八百五十五个农业社中，有一百八十二个社的母畜配种率达百分之百，有十七个社做到配一头准一头，有四百三十三个社做到产一头活一头，有三十二个社做到“四全”。水牛的繁殖率，过去一般都认为是低的，但安徽东流县新建农业社却创造了很高的纪录，该社1956年有能繁殖母牛八十四头，生小牛五十一头，繁殖率达到60％；1957年有能繁殖母牛九十五头，生小牛八十七头，繁殖率达90％。在马匹方面，以黑龙江省龙江县为例，1957年全县共有一万九千零六十一匹可繁殖的母马，受胎一万二千九百一十匹，达适龄母马总数的60％以上，受胎率比1956年提高16％。在羊只方面，陕西志丹县1957年全县绵、山羊净增殖率为22％，河北盐山县1953年仅有羊三万多只，1957年底已达到十万四千只。四年共增加二倍多，速度是不慢的。至于生猪生产，由于党大力抓了一下，去年到现在就有了飞跃的发展。以上都说明牲畜发展的潜力是很大的，加速提高净增殖率、大量增加头数是完全可能的。必须在畜牧业生产方面，克服右倾保守思想，坚决贯彻多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，组织畜牧业生产大跃进，以掀起农牧业生产的全面高潮。
        四项根本措施
    为了实现畜牧业生产的大跃进，苦战三年，改变我国畜牧业的面貌，超额完成第二个五年计划指标，提前实现农业发展纲要对畜牧业的要求，真正建立起我国数多、质好、种类繁多、具有高度增殖率和高额畜产品的社会主义畜牧业，必须抓紧以下几项根本措施：
    一、积极开展牲畜繁殖和改良工作：首先要把今年春季配种运动大力开展起来。只有今年配的多，明年才能生的多，并给今后几年内大发展打下基础。在繁殖配种的同时，必须抓紧改良牲畜品种，提高牲畜体质。这就必须把所有公、母牲畜饲养好，不要使役过度，这样才能促使母畜正常发情，增强种公畜配种性能。此外，要很好地解决目前种畜不足问题，最经济最有效的办法：是依靠群众，依靠农业社就地取材，就地选种，发动每个农业社自留种畜，保证牲畜配种计划的完成。只有这样才能多快好省。有计划地引进外国的或外地的优良种畜是必需的，但只能起辅助作用。单纯依靠外来的种畜，其结果必然是少慢差费。各地要建立良种培育站，指导农牧业合作社做好选种配种工作。同时应有计划地在现有良种牲畜的产区建立良种基地，如南阳牛、三河马、伊犁马、定县猪、金华猪、新疆毛肉兼用细毛羊等的产地，都可以大力发展，成为供应各地种畜的基地。这些优良品种可以大力推广，但只有这些优良的品种还是不够的。选留种畜，培育良种的工作，也必须大家动手，遍地开花。除了依靠良种基地，依靠国营种畜繁殖场以外，更主要的是贯彻自繁自养自改良的方针，依靠合作社自己培育种畜并进行牲畜的杂交改良工作。地区之间必需的调剂工作，在目前牲畜发展不平衡的情况下，是极为必要的，我们要与第二商业部门密切协作，统筹安排，有计划地作好牲畜调剂工作。
    二、认真地有计划地发展饲料生产。饲草饲料是保证牲畜数多质好的物质基础。要把牲畜发展放在稳固的基础上，就要对这些根本性的措施给以极大的重视和认真的安排。在制定畜牧生产发展规划的同时，要做出相应的饲料生产的规划，做到每繁殖一头牲畜就同时生产一份饲料。首先，必须大量采用代用饲料，少用精料多用粗料；大力推广青贮玉米秸、花生藤、野草，以及调制各种发酵饲料，碱化麦秸、稻草等办法。同时要使牲畜喂得肥，长得快，确实需要有一定的精料。要充分利用谷物副产品，要组织各地农业社充分利用荒坡，隙地，夏秋休闲地和在可能条件下留出一定面积的耕地，有计划的种植高产饲料作物。牧区要大力经营草原，积极开发水源，发展草原水利，解决人畜用水，做到水草丰茂；实行分区轮牧和封滩育草，积极消灭虫害和兽害，剔除杂木害草，在必要的地方施肥，补播牧草等办法，扩大草原利用率，提高草原的载畜量。并且要做好定居游牧工作，建立饲料基地，种植精饲料。
    三、积极防治牲畜疫病。我们在第一个五年计划期内，对于牛瘟已经做到基本消灭，这是我国畜疫防治工作的一个大胜利。在第二个五年计划内应用最大力量首先消灭猪瘟，同时对鸡瘟、牛肺疫、马鼻疽、口蹄疫、猪囊虫、羊痘、牛疥癣及牲畜血吸虫病等严重疫病，也须基本消灭或控制蔓延，以实现农业发展纲要的规定。最根本的办法是依靠群众，把防重于治的方针贯彻到每个合作社的畜牧生产活动中去。目前有不少合作社建立了自己的兽医诊所，培养了猪医生，牛医生，建立了合理的饲养管理制度，这些办法为防治牲畜疫病打下了良好的基础。猪瘟免化弱毒疫苗，制造简单、效果大、价钱便宜，很多地区都采取了现地制造、及时供应的办法，很受群众欢迎，应大力推广。鸡瘟疫苗也是制造简单、收效很快的药剂。许多省区都在大量训练制造疫苗的人员，提出三、五年内消灭鸡瘟的规划，这是非常好的。当前在这方面的任务是积极推广各地的先进经验，帮助农业社培养防疫员，切实组织利用民间兽医的力量，加强兽医药械的生产和供应，并做好检疫工作。
    四、加强畜牧兽医的科学研究工作。我国有悠久的经营畜牧业的传统，在群众中积累了许多宝贵的经验。祖国的畜牧兽医科学遗产和群众经验，要积极进行系统的整理和总结，让它在我国社会主义畜牧业的发展中放出光辉；同时，也必须让它在现代科学的基础上得到更大的发展。我们在这方面的工作还是很薄弱的，要把各高等农业院校的畜牧兽医系建立和充实起来，各中等农校也要加强畜牧专业课的教学。畜牧兽医科学研究机构要加强试验研究工作，在培育和改良品种、防治疫病、生物药品制造等方面，认真总结群众先进经验，结合我国实际情况，吸取外国科学研究成果，大胆进行创造，克服目前某些畜牧兽医科学研究单位和人员中存在着的只研究外国、不研究本国，讲排场，图阔气，脱离农村，脱离实际的严重的资产阶级思想与教条主义，以便把我国畜牧兽医科学迅速发展起来，使之成为促进畜牧业生产大跃进的有力武器。
    适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，高速度地发展畜牧业，在我国具备着极为有利的条件。我国地处温带，有广大的草原和山区、水区，这是最广阔的饲料基地和生长丰富多样的饲草饲料的优良自然条件。随着谷物生产的跃进，粮食及饲料作物单位面积产量的提高和总产量的增加，一切农副业产品的增长，将会大大改善饲养条件，使畜牧业有着稳固可靠的基础。我国大小牲畜、家禽及各种皮毛兽，有很多优良的珍奇的品种，这就使我们牲畜改良提高工作有着异常优越的条件。我国人口众多，既有充足的劳力，又有广大的国内市场，我国农民有经营畜牧业的历史传统和习惯，积累了不少宝贵的经验，特别在合作化以后，在无比优越的社会主义的生产关系和社会制度下，生产力得到空前解放，随着工农业生产的高潮，群众发展畜牧业的要求和积极性也空前地增高了，我们完全相信，在党的英明领导下，认真贯彻鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地社会主义建设的总方针总路线，我国的畜牧业是可以打破成规，高速度发展的。在第二个五年计划内，我们完全有信心提前实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的要求，再经过十年左右，我国畜牧业生产，将和农业一样超过一切资本主义国家的水平，成为世界上牲畜和畜产品最多最好的具有高度发展的畜牧业的国家。（附图表）
