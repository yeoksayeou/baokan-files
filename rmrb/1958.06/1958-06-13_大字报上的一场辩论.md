A Debate on Big-Character Posters

The members of the Chefu Cooperative in the Xiasuai Township, Huaiji County, Guangdong Province, posted a big-character poster criticizing the First Production Team:

	The seedlings of the First Team cry "woe is me,"
	All are shouting that they're hungry;
	Yellow faces and skinny bones, hard to bear,
	Dense planting starves them into fine-toothed combs.

	I am a seedling of the First Team,
	Who knows if I live or die of hunger;
	Weeds grow tall and wild,
	Passersby feel pity, tears wetting their clothes.

The members of the First Production Team, seeing the criticism on the big-character poster, felt unconvinced and immediately wrote a big-character poster explaining the reasons:

	The First Team lags behind for a reason,
	Few people are engaged in formal labor,
	Thin fields many, fertile fields few,
	Any technique is difficult to cultivate.

	The First Team has the most hilly fields,
	How many people know the hardship;
	Night battles see some people showing up,
	Thousands of catties of base fertilizer are also applied;
	The seedlings are bad because the fields are poor,
	Why so many complaints against people?

The members of other teams, seeing that the First Team did not accept criticism and instead tried to justify and refute it, wrote another big-character poster:

	The First Team lags behind for a reason,
	The reason is not diligent enough;
	When it rains, they say the road is slippery,
	When the sky clears, they say they are dizzy from the sun.

	Saying thin fields are many is false,
	Right-leaning conservatism is true.
	The First Team's leadership is truly different,
	Three types of seedlings sprout and sprout;
	They are unwilling to do early cultivation;
	They don't apply fertilizer, but leave it at home;
	We are all led by the same cooperative,
	But our thoughts are not the same.

The new big-character poster spoke to the hearts of the First Team members, convincing them and making them admit their mistakes, and they expressed their determination:

	The First Team admits it is poor,
	Everyone helps and laughs;
	We will immediately improve,
	And in the future, we will be excellent.

	The First Team lagging behind is true,
	Few people are actively producing;
	Thank you for helping us,
	We are determined to correct our mistakes and become new people.

	Although today's production is behind,
	In the future, we will catch up and be champions.

### 大字报上的一场辩论

    大字报上的一场辩论
    广东怀集县下帅乡车福社的社员贴了一张批评第一生产队的大字报：
    一队禾苗哭呵呵，
    纷纷叫喊肚饥饿；
    面黄骨瘦真难抵，
    密植饿成细头梳。
    我是一队慨（的）禾苗，
    饿生饿死有（无）人知；
    杂草横生高又大，
    行人痛惜泪湿衣。
    第一生产队的社员看到大字报上的批评，心中不服，马上写了一张大字报申述原因：
    一队落后有原因，
    正式劳动无几人，
    瘦慨（的）田多肥田少，
    任何技术难耕耘。
    一队山田多第一，
    不知辛苦几多人；
    夜战出勤有人去，
    基肥亦落几千斤；
    禾苗不好是田瘦，
    何必诸多埋怨人？
    其他队的社员见到一队不接受批评，还转弯抹角的来辩解和反驳，于是又写了这样一张大字报：
    一队落后有原因，
    原因就是不出勤；
    下雨之时讲路滑，
    天开又话头晒晕。
    讲话瘦田多是假，
    右倾保守却是真。
    一队领导实不同，
    三类禾苗涌又涌；
    提早中耕唔（不）愿做；
    有肥唔（不）落放家中；
    大家同个社领导，
    原来思想不相同。
    新的大字报句句说到一队社员的心里，使他们口服心服，承认了错误，并表示决心：
    一队禾苗自认差，
    大家帮助笑哈哈；
    我们立即来改进，
    将来做到顶呱呱。
    一队落后实是真，
    积极生产无几人；
    多谢你们来帮助，
    决心改过做新人。
    今天生产虽落后，
    将来赶上做冠军。
