Who is the Interventionist?
　　By a commentator of this newspaper

    On June 6th, the United Nations Security Council held a meeting to discuss Lebanon's so-called accusation that the United Arab Republic was "interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs." At the meeting, Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik insisted that the United Arab Republic had carried out "large-scale, illegal, and unwarranted interference" in Lebanon's internal affairs. U.S. Representative Barco openly demanded that "all relevant parties" take measures to "maintain" Lebanon's independence and sovereignty. British Representative Dixon also chimed in. They obviously wanted to use the so-called "accusation" against the United Arab Republic to portray Lebanon's internal affairs as an international issue, in order to further interfere in the situation in Lebanon.

    The purpose of the armed uprising launched by the Lebanese people this time is to oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the pro-Western Chamoun government. This struggle is a struggle to defend Lebanon's national independence. Therefore, from the beginning, the Lebanese people opposed foreign interference. The National Front, composed of major opposition parties, also issued a statement and submitted a memorandum to the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, protesting against U.S. interference in internal affairs. After the Lebanese authorities filed a false accusation against the United Arab Republic with the Security Council, many opposition parties in Lebanon sent telegrams to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, pointing out that the accusation was false and aimed at creating an excuse for further foreign interference. However, the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and others, and their agents, have not stopped their conspiracy activities because of this, which further exposes their ferocious face of resolutely opposing the Lebanese people.

    The U.S. representative paid lip service to "maintaining" Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. But who is it that has damaged Lebanon's sovereignty and independence? The United States and its agents slander the United Arab Republic for "interfering" in Lebanon's internal affairs, but they have not presented any sufficient evidence. Even U.S. diplomats privately have to admit this. On the contrary, the evidence of U.S. interference in Lebanon's internal affairs is obvious to all. Just as the Security Council was discussing the Lebanese authorities' false accusations, the leader of the Lebanese opposition parties publicly displayed the weapons recently supplied by the United States to the reactionary National Socialist Party thugs to massacre the Lebanese people. Are these weapons not ironclad evidence of the United States undermining Lebanon's independence and sovereignty?

    While the Security Council was meeting to discuss the Lebanese authorities' false accusations, the activities of the United States and its agents in Lebanon intensified. Senior military officers from the United States, Britain, and Jordan are in frequent contact with the Lebanese authorities to discuss how to strengthen the suppression of the Lebanese people. This is clearly coordinated with the U.S. activities in the Security Council. This deserves the vigilance of the Lebanese people and all peace-loving people.

    The situation in Lebanon is a matter of internal affairs. No foreign country has the right to interfere. The U.S. trick of instigating the Lebanese authorities to make false accusations against the United Arab Republic cannot distort the essence of the problem, nor can it cover up its own crimes. The Lebanese people can see clearly who is the interventionist, and they are fighting against the interference of the United States and its followers.

    谁是干涉者？
　　本报评论员
    6月6日，联合国安理会举行会议，讨论黎巴嫩提出的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政”的控告。在会上，黎巴嫩外交部长马利克硬说阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩内政进行了“大规模的、非法的和无端的干涉”。美国代表巴尔斯更公然要求“一切有关方面”采取措施，“维护”黎巴嫩的独立和主权。英国代表狄克逊也跟着帮腔。他们显然是想通过对阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓“控告”，把黎巴嫩的内政问题说成是国际问题，以便于进一步干涉黎巴嫩的局势。
    黎巴嫩人民这次发动武装起义，目的在于反对“艾森豪威尔主义”和亲西方的夏蒙政府。这个斗争是保卫黎巴嫩民族独立的斗争，因此，斗争一开始，黎巴嫩人民就反对外国干涉。由主要反对党派组成的民族阵线也曾发表声明，并向美国驻黎巴嫩大使提出备忘录，抗议美国干涉内政。黎巴嫩当局向安全理事会提出对阿拉伯联合共和国的诬告以后，黎巴嫩许多反对党曾打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指出这个控告是虚伪的，目的是要为外国进一步干涉制造借口。但是，美、英等帝国主义者及其代理人并未因此停止它们的阴谋活动，这就更加暴露了它们坚决和黎巴嫩人民为敌的凶恶面目。
    美国代表口口声声要“维护”黎巴嫩的主权和独立。然而究竟谁损害了黎巴嫩的主权和独立呢？美国及其代理人诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”黎巴嫩内政，但是，它们并没有举出任何充分证据。甚至，连美国外交官私下里也不得不承认这一点。相反地，美国干涉黎巴嫩内政的证据，却是人所共见的。就在安理会讨论黎巴嫩当局的诬告时，黎巴嫩的反对党领袖，便公开展出了美国最近供给反动的国家社会党党徒屠杀黎巴嫩人民的武器。这些武器难道不是美国损害黎巴嫩独立和主权的铁证么？
    在安理会开会讨论黎巴嫩当局诬告的同时，美国及其代理人在黎巴嫩国内的活动也加紧了。美国、英国和约旦的高级军官，正和黎巴嫩当局进行频繁接触，讨论如何加强镇压黎巴嫩人民问题。这同美国在安理会的活动显然是互相配合的。这值得黎巴嫩人民和一切和平人民提高警惕。
    黎巴嫩的局势，是一个内政问题。任何外国都无权过问。美国唆使黎巴嫩当局对阿拉伯联合共和国进行诬告的伎俩，歪曲不了问题的实质，也掩饰不了它们自己的罪行。谁是干涉者，黎巴嫩人民是看得清清楚楚的，他们正为反对美国及其追随者的干涉而斗争。
