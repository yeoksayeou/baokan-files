    福建建成羽毛球练习馆
    据新华社福州22日电  福建羽毛球练习馆，今天在福州市举行落成典礼。
    这个羽毛球练习馆是去年年底动工的，面积达八六六点七七平方公尺，室内设有四个羽毛球场，可以同时进行练习或比赛。球场高度达十公尺，地板用硬木铺成，四周共有五十一个玻璃窗，光线充足，并有足够的灯光设备。
    新的练习馆是为了进一步提高福建省羽毛球运动的水平而兴建的。福建省是我国羽毛球运动水平较高的一个省份，拥有一支实力雄厚的羽毛球队，在国内外球坛上获得了很好的声誉。福建省运动健将陈福寿和王文教都曾代表我国参加过1957年莫斯科第六届青年联欢节、第三届国际青年友谊运动会羽毛球表演赛，荣获男子单打第一、二名和男子双打第一名。1957年全国十三城市网球、羽毛球锦标赛，在羽毛球比赛项目中，男子单打前五名、双打一、二、三名，女子单打前四名、双打一、三名分别为福州、厦门两市羽毛球代表队所夺。
