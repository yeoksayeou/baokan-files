    Planting Red Flags All Over the Ground and in the Sky
    —After Watching the Performance of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers in Sichuan Province
    Guo Moruo
    We are called revolutionary soldiers,
    Truly feeling the pinnacle of honor.
    Our limbs may be incomplete,
    But we are firm in our revolutionary ambition.
    Difficulties cannot break the heroic men,
    With full energy, anything can be done.
    For the revolution, losing ten fingers,
    But we still have two arms.
    We can compete in table tennis,
    We can play the harmonica.
    We can dance the Ordos dance,
    We can be the conductor of the orchestra.
    Yesterday, we held guns to fight the enemy,
    Today, we play music for peace.
    The music of peace has great power,
    Inspiring the revolution of culture and technology.
    Yesterday, we charged fiercely into battle,
    Today, we play "The East is Red" magnificently.
    Although US imperialism has atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs,
    It is only knocking on its own funeral bell.
    Building socialism is everyone's responsibility,
    Everyone must strive to be upstream and exert full energy.
    The brilliance of the General Line illuminates us,
    We must also compete to be more, faster, better, and more economical.
    Revolutionary heroism is like this,
    Everyone must dare to contend, dare to speak out, dare to do, and dare to think.
    There will be no useless people under the socialist system,
    Look at us, aren't we a good example?
    Revolutionary optimism is like this,
    Everyone must play music and sing and dance.
    Singing until we far surpass Britain and catch up with America,
    Planting red flags all over the ground and in the sky!

    把红旗插遍在地上和天上
    ——看了四川省革命残废军人演出
    郭沫若
    我们被称为革命军人，
    真真感受着荣誉的绝顶。
    我们的肢体虽然不全，
    我们坚定着革命的雄心。
    困难磨折不了英雄汉，
    鼓足干劲，什么都可以干。
    为革命，失掉了十个指头，
    但我们还有着两只手杆。
    我们可以比赛乒乓球，
    我们可以把口琴吹奏。
    我们可以跳舞鄂尔多斯，
    我们可以做乐队的指挥手。
    昨天手拿枪杆打敌人，
    今天演奏音乐为和平。
    和平的音乐具有大威力，
    鼓舞着文化技术的革命。
    昨天猛烈地陷阵冲锋，
    今天雄壮地吹奏东方红。
    尽管美帝有原子弹、氢弹，
    只是在敲撞自己的葬钟。
    建设社会主义，人人都有份，
    谁都要力争上游，鼓足干劲。
    总路线的光辉照耀着我们，
    我们也要比赛着多快好省。
    革命的英雄主义就是这样，
    谁都要敢争、敢鸣、敢做、敢想。
    社会主义制度下不会有废人，
    请看我们，不就是好榜样？
    革命的乐观主义就是这样，
    谁都要吹吹打打，跳跳唱唱。
    唱到远远地超英并超美呵，
    把红旗插遍在地上和天上！
