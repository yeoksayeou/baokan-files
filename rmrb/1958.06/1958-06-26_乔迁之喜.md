One afternoon, five or six of us went to the first newly built residential area of the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs of Chengdu to congratulate the members who had just moved in on their new homes.

This residential area is called Yuejin Village. It has a total of twenty-one brick buildings, and 183 households have already moved in. It was built recently after more than eighty days of intense labor, starting this Spring Festival. Not far from Chadianzi, you can see rows of buildings towering among the bamboo forests and trees, with green tiles and red walls, surrounded by a continuous expanse of green rice paddies.

We had neither a letter of introduction nor knew any of the members, but after crossing the small stream at the entrance of the village, we started to take action, shaking hands and congratulating everyone we met. Unexpectedly, the hosts treated us, these uninvited guests, even more warmly than we had imagined. These days, everyone is busy transplanting mid-season rice, and those who can transplant have gone to the fields, leaving behind almost all children and the elderly. Therefore, we could ask whatever we wanted without hindering production.

Next to a flower bed in the street, we met an old man with a white beard, named Zhong Qingrong, who was already seventy years old. He told us, "When Premier Zhou came to our cooperative in March, I said to him, 'People have been talking about upstairs and downstairs for years. I thought I'd be buried with soil up to my chin before I had that luck! I never imagined it would happen now!' Look, everything is bright and spacious!" Holding his pipe, he turned around to look at the buildings in front and behind. "You haven't seen my grandchildren yet!" he continued, "Going up and down the stairs, they always stomp loudly, like doing drills! Well, that's understandable. From the old houses, even if you climbed on the roof, you couldn't see this far!"

Soon, this old man became our guide, leading us to see the deputy director, Zhang Xirong. The deputy director was not at home, so he searched everywhere and finally found a production team leader named Xie Huili, who was lean and energetic, only in his twenties. This production team leader introduced us to the cooperative's entire construction plan, as well as some of the main situations during the construction of Yuejin Village. The cooperative has more than 1,400 households. In addition to Yuejin Village, they plan to build three larger residential areas, to be completed before the autumn of next year, and all residents will be centralized.

The production team leader told us enthusiastically that after the four residential areas are completed, the cooperative can expand its cultivated land by more than 1,200 mu and increase grain production by 2.16 million jin per year. He also introduced us to the many other benefits brought about by this pioneering initiative, saying, "Originally, there were courtyards everywhere. When the tractor was driven, it just had to turn and turn, fearing to hit the houses. Now it's better, it can drive straight through!" Zhong Qingrong interjected, "This is good for meetings too! Before, if you held a meeting at night, you'd have to shout until your throat was hoarse! You'd always hear people answering 'Coming!' but you'd never see their shadows!..."

When talking about the source of funds, the production team leader told many touching stories in one breath. They strictly followed the principle of "self-raised and self-built," neither borrowing from the state nor using the cooperative's public accumulation, but relying entirely on the investment of the members. And in order to invest, many members took out the scrap metal they usually didn't care about from under their beds and from the ash heaps to sell. Moreover, all the members voluntarily handed over their annual cloth coupons to the cooperative, preparing not to make new clothes, and saving money to invest. "Of course!" the production team leader continued, "Without the support of all parties, it wouldn't work. Even a mental hospital over there mobilized some patients with mild conditions to help us move wood!"

We all couldn't help laughing. Two or three children next to us also laughed; however, the reason they laughed was obviously somewhat different from ours. Because then they went upstairs together, stomping their feet loudly. Just like Grandpa Zhong described his grandchildren, like they were doing drills. And as they walked down again in the same loud way, the production team leader was telling us how they built a road overnight to facilitate the transport of bricks by truck. "The enthusiasm for production is even greater!" he continued, "Last year, with twenty mu of double-cropping rice, the team members all complained they were too busy. Isn't it strange? This year, they're doing eighty mu, and they're still doing it!..."

Because we heard that the team was cutting sweet potato vines, we said goodbye and asked Grandpa Zhong to lead us to see a few more families. However, many members of the families were not there; they had gone to the fields, and the small red doors were locked with padlocks. Through the glass windows, you could see the brightly washed wooden furniture, picture frames, and colorful paintings. Every time we passed a house, the old man would introduce us to the family's past living conditions. He described them saying, "If you planted a pumpkin next to the eaves, you'd have to worry about it leaking from the roof!"

Finally, we arrived at Feng Guanghua's house. Feng Guanghua himself had gone to the fields, and only his mother was at home. She was a widow in her fifties, very thin, suffering from severe bronchitis, and was mending clothes under a locust tree. Apart from the kitchen, she had two rooms upstairs. As soon as we explained our purpose, she brightened her eyes, stood up, and exclaimed with a smile, "Okay! Please sit upstairs!" While busy collecting clothes, she was also busy with us, leading us upstairs. She was out of breath all the way.

She hardly stopped talking. But her words were a bit disjointed, obviously she wanted to say too much, and didn't have time to sort them out. She asked us to sit down for a moment, and then ran to the window, smiling, "Look, how far can you see from here!" Then she turned back, pointing to the old furniture and complaining, "It's just that these things don't match this room!"

Grandpa Zhong interjected with a smile, "You haven't seen the house she used to live in. It was the worst in our area!" This hint was good. Then we got Feng Da Niang's permission to go and see her old house together. This old house was in a bamboo grove, with a total of five rooms, which were indeed dilapidated and a bit scary! Leaning to one side, the surrounding tree supports were more numerous than the pillars.

Feng Da Niang was still busy with us, "Comrades! This pillar is still held up with wire!" We looked in the direction of her gesture: two strands of wire tightly wrapped around the most severely leaning pillar, one end tied to a chinaberry tree outside the house.

It was truly unimaginable that the Feng family had lived in this house for three generations!

"You ask how we lived here in the past?" Because someone asked this, the old woman replied with a smile, "We ran into the bamboo forest whenever there was a big wind. It was much better after liberation, and we had more money to support it with a few more trees. Before liberation, whenever there was a little wind at night, we always felt we couldn't sleep!"

"Now it's better!" one of my companions said with a smile, "You can sleep peacefully at night!"

Feng Da Niang sighed with a smile, "I still can't sleep well these days!..."

Grandpa Zhong joked, "It's because you're too happy!"

"That's right! When I think about living in such a bright and spacious house, how can I sleep!..."

Feng Da Niang admitted and laughed heartily, as if she had become younger.

In fact, everyone we met that day was in high spirits. When I went back at night, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep well, repeatedly thinking about the profound historical significance of this bold initiative of the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative.

    乔迁之喜
    沙汀
    一天下午，我们五六个人，一同到成都市西郊友谊农业社的第一个新建的居民点去，向那些新搬进去的社员祝贺乔迁之喜。
    这个居民点叫跃进村，一共有二十一幢砖砌楼房，已经迁入社员一百八十三户。是今年春节开始，经过八十多天的紧张劳动，最近修建成的。走出茶店子不远，就可以望见那一排排高耸在竹林树丛间的楼房，青瓦红墙，四面全是一片连着一片的碧绿的稻田。
    我们既没有介绍信，也不认识任何一个社员，但是，跨过村口那条小溪，我们便开始活动起来，见了人就握手祝贺。出乎意外，对于我们这批不速之客，主人们招待得比我们想像的还热烈。这几天正忙着栽中稻，凡是能够栽插的人，都到田里去了，留下来的几乎全是小孩和老人，因此我们可以随便问东问西，不致妨碍生产。
    在街道中一个花坛旁边，我们碰见一个胡须花白的老人，叫锺清荣，已经七十岁了。他告诉我们：“3月间周总理到我们社里来，我向他说，‘早几年就在闹楼上楼下，我想，我土巴都埋到下巴了，没有这个福啊！那里想到现在就干起来了！’你看，到处都亮堂堂的！”扶着叶子烟竿，他打了一个转身，瞧瞧前前后后的楼房。“你们还没看到我那些孙娃子啊！”他接着说：“上楼下楼，总是把楼梯踏得冬冬冬响，跟下操一样！本来也是，从前住的房子，你就爬上屋顶，也望不到这么远呀！”
    很快，这个老人就成了我们的向导，领我们去看副社长张锡荣。副社长不在家，他又四面八方去找，结果找来了一个生产队长，叫谢惠礼，精干瘦削，只有二十多岁。这个生产队长向我们介绍了全社的修建计划，以及跃进村修建过程中的一些主要情况。这个社一共有一千四百多户，除开跃进村外，他们还准备再建三个更大的居民点，明年秋前完成，全部集中起来居住。
    这个生产队长兴致勃勃地告诉我们，四个居民点建成后，全社可以扩大耕地面积一千二百多亩，每年增产粮食二百一十六万市斤。他还向我们介绍这个创举带来的其他许多好处，说道：“原来到处都是院子，拖拉机开起来只顾倒拐，怕把房子撞倒。现在好了，可以笔直开过去了！”这中间锺清荣插嘴道：“这个对开会也好呀！原早么，晚上开它个会，不把你的喉咙吼破！老听见在答应‘来了！’老是人影子也不见！……”
    在谈到经费来源时，生产队长一气说了不少动人的故事。他们是严格按照“自筹自建”的原则办事的，一不向国家贷款，二不动用社的公共积累，完全依靠社员投资。而为了投资，不少社员，把平日毫不在意的破铜烂铁，都从床脚下、灰堆里掏出来卖了。而且，所有的社员都自动把全年的布票交到社上，准备不要添制衣服，把钱节约起来投资。“当然啊！”生产队长接下去道，“没有各方面的支援，也不成的，就连那边一个经神病院，都动员了一些轻病号帮我们搬过木料！……”
    我们全都忍不住大笑起来。旁边两三个小孩子，也跟着笑起来；但是，他们笑的原因，显然和我们多少有点不同。因为接着他们就乒乒乓乓，一起大踏步上楼去了。正跟锺大爷形容他的孙娃那样，像在下操。而当他们同样乒乒乓乓走下来时，生产队长正在告诉我们，他们怎样在一夜之间修成一条便于卡车运砖的公路。“生产的劲头更加大啊！”他接着道，“去年二十亩双季稻，队员都叫唤忙不过来，你看怪吧，今年一搞就八十亩，还是搞下去了！……”
    因为听说队上正在剪接苕藤，我们就告别了出来，请锺大爷领我们再找几家看看。但是，好些社员全家人都不在，下田去了，红漆的小门上挂着洋锁。透过玻璃窗子，可以看见洗刷得透亮的木器、像片框和五彩图画。每每走过一家，那个老年人总要为我们介绍一番这家人过去的居住情况。他形容它们说，“屋檐边栽窝南瓜，都得担心从房顶上漏下来啊！”
    最后，我们到了冯光华家里。冯光华本人下田去了，只有他妈一个人在家。这是个五十多岁的寡妇，人很瘦小，患着严重支气管炎，正在一株洋槐下面补连衣服。除开灶屋，她有两间楼房。才一说明来意，她就亮着眼睛，站起来笑嚷道，“好呀！请到楼上坐吧！”一面忙着收捡衣服，一面忙着张罗我们，把我们领上楼了。一路不住喘气。
    她几乎很少停嘴。但是她的话语有点零乱，显然她想说的话太多了，而又来不及理出一个头绪。她一时要我们坐下来，一时又一头奔到窗子边去，笑道，“你们看吧，这要望多远呀！”接着却又回过头来，指着那些破旧家具诉苦，“就是这些东西摆在这屋里太不称了！”
    锺大爷插进来笑道，“你们还没有看过她从前住的房子啊，在我们这一带要考头名！”这个提示很好，接着我们就得到冯大娘的同意，一道去看她的老屋。这座老屋在个竹林盘里，一共五间，的确破烂得有些吓人！东倒西歪的，周围撑的树料比柱子多。
    冯大娘照样忙个不停地张罗我们，“同志！这根柱头还是用铁丝拉住的啊！”我们顺着她的手势望去：一根歪斜得最厉害的柱子上面，紧紧绕着两股铁丝，一头套在屋外一根苦莲树上。
    这真有些不可想像，冯家已经在这个屋子里住了三代人了！
    “你问过去我们怎么住下来的？”因为有人问起这个，老太婆笑嘻嘻回答道，“一吹大风就往竹林里边跑呀，解放后好多了，还有钱多撑几根树子，解放前么，晚上起一点风，总是觉得睡不着啊！”
    “现在好了！”我的一个同伴笑道，“晚上可以安安心心睡了！”
    冯大娘笑着叹了口气：“这两天还是睡不好啊！……”
    锺大爷打趣道：“这是太高兴了！”
    “就是这个话啊！一想到会住那么亮堂堂的房子，哪里还有啥瞌睡呀！……”
    冯大娘一面满口承认，一面畅快地笑起来，好像一下变年青了。
    其实，这天我们碰见的每一个人，精神都很振奋。晚上回去，就连我也激动得没有睡好，反复思索着友谊农业社这个大胆创举的深刻历史意义。
