“Entomology” Goes to the Fields

“The professor came to the countryside to help us control pests!” The villagers of Dazhongsi Agricultural Cooperative in Haidian District said with smiles as they welcomed Professor Lin Changshan from Peking University to the fields.

In the May fields of the Beijing suburbs, everything was lush and green. Lin Changshan and his colleagues from the Invertebrate Entomology Teaching and Research Section brought some diagrams and specimens to the field to explain to the villagers the process of cotton aphid growth and control methods. After several investigations and visits, they had a comprehensive understanding of the pest situation here and formulated a plan to help this agricultural cooperative become a "pest-free agricultural cooperative" in three to five years.

In the past, students' production internships were only done in the insect research institute for indoor experiments. They believed that using production problems as research paper topics was "low level" and "without theoretical value." But the result was that students didn't even recognize the "eight major pests" after graduation; and graduate students' papers could not solve practical problems.

Now, Professor Lin Changshan realizes that cadres who study entomology must be able to solve practical problems, and must go into actual production. Therefore, he took the initiative to contact the Dazhongsi Agricultural Cooperative and decided to bring entomology from the classroom to the fields.

The Gospel for Dental Patients

The outpatient department of the Department of Stomatology at Beijing Medical College has recently received many letters of praise from patients. Patient Xia Weixia wrote that for more than ten years, she had consulted Chinese and foreign dentists in Suzhou, Guangzhou, and other places, but had never encountered a doctor as meticulous and patient as Hu Biqiong, saying she was a good doctor educated by the Communist Party.

This stomatology outpatient department previously had consultation hours of only five hours. Patients had to wait two or three weeks to have a tooth extracted. During the "Double-Anti" movement, the enthusiasm of the teachers, students, and nurses working in this outpatient department greatly increased. They unanimously requested to work eight hours a day to the end and at the same time changed the consultation hours to twelve hours. Some old professors who previously thought that going to the outpatient department was beneath their dignity also personally consulted patients. In less than a month, through the concerted efforts of doctors, nurses, and technicians, more than 400 backlogged cases were treated in a concentrated manner. In the past, it took patients up to half a year to get a notification whether dentures could be made, but now they can get a model of their dentures in a week.

He is Getting Younger and Younger

Recently, every morning and afternoon, people often see Professor Liu Kaixiang, who is nearly fifty years old, doing labor-hygiene exercises or practicing Tai Chi on the sports field of the Beijing Mining Institute.

Those who have worked with Professor Liu Kaixiang know that he never liked sports. Why has he suddenly become an activist on the playground recently? It turns out that after making a self-examination in the ideological revolution movement, he became more confident in the future. He often says to people with a smile: "Now I am getting younger and younger!" He is determined to "work for the motherland for another thirty years!" This is the reason why he has been actively exercising recently. (Fu Jun)

Now the Pipa is Enjoyed Together

One evening, from the room of Professor Wang Shuxian of Beijing Medical College, there came a burst of pipa music, laughter, and applause... People passing by the window couldn't help but stop and listen. It turned out that Professor Wang Shuxian was a skilled pipa player, but in the past, he often buried himself in his study alone and never played his pipa for others. Some people wanted to hear him play the pipa, but he declined, saying, "I am not a street performer."

Why is this professor now playing the pipa in front of so many people? Wang Shuxian said to people: "In the great ideological revolution movement, I threw away the baggage of bourgeois individualism. Now I am heading towards socialism with a light load, how can I not be happy!"

Teachers' Choir

Not long ago, more than fifty professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Peking University formed a "Teachers' Choir." The loud singing of "The East Wind Prevails over the West Wind..." often resounds through Yanyuan.

There are eight or nine professors in this choir. Hou Renzhi, director of the Department of Geology and Geography, and Chu Shengling, director of the Department of Physics, are both active members of the choir. Hou Renzhi happily said to people: "Singing, in my past view, was a matter for young people. Now, aren't we singing just as well as young people?" (Fu Jun)

Small Statistics

In the "Double-Anti" movement, the 120,000 teachers, students, and staff of Beijing's 34 institutions of higher learning posted a total of 7,724,700 big-character posters from March 5th to April 18th. An average of 227,197 posters were posted per school, and an average of 64 posters were posted per person. The school with the most big-character posters was Tsinghua University, with a total of 2,700,000 posters. The school with the least was the Central Academy of Fine Arts, with a total of 9,000 posters. (Attached images)

    丢掉个人主义心情舒畅  北京高等学校面貌一新
    “昆虫学”下田
    “教授下乡帮我们治虫子来了！”海淀区大钟寺农业社老乡们边说边笑地欢迎北京大学林昌善教授来到田间。
    五月的京郊田野，一片青葱翠绿。林昌善和无脊椎昆虫教研室的同事们带着一些图样和标本在地头给老乡们讲解棉蚜虫成长的过程和防治办法。经过好几次的调查、访问，他们对这里的虫害情况有了全面了解，并且订出规划，要帮助这个农业社在三、五年内成为“无虫害农业社”。
    过去学生们的生产实习，只在昆虫研究所做室内实验。他们认为把生产上的问题作为研究论文题目，“水平低”、“没有理论价值”。但结果是，学生毕业后连“八大害虫”也不认识；研究生的论文则不能解决实际问题。
    现在，林昌善教授认识到，研究昆虫学的干部要能解决实际问题，一定要到生产实际中去，因此他主动同大钟寺农业社联系，决定把昆虫学从课堂带到田间去。

    牙病患者的福音
    北京医学院口腔学系的门诊部最近收到不少病人的表扬信。患者夏蔚霞来信说，十多年来，她曾在苏州、广州等地请中外牙医治疗牙病，但还没有遇到像胡碧琼那样细致、耐心的大夫，这是共产党教育出来的好大夫。
    这个口腔门诊部以前门诊的时间只五个小时。病人来院拔牙，要等两三个星期。双反运动中，在这个门诊部工作的师生和护士的热情大大提高，一致要求八小时一班顶到底，同时将门诊时间改成了十二小时，以前认为下门诊有失身份的一些老教授也亲自应诊了。在不到一个月内，经过医生、护士和技工的通力合作，将积压下的四百多个病例突击诊治完毕。以前病人镶牙最长要半年才能得到通知能不能作，现在一个礼拜就能取到假牙模型了。

    他越活越年轻了
    最近，每天清晨和下午，在北京矿业学院的运动场上，人们常常看到年近半百的刘开祥教授，不是在做劳卫操，就是在打太极拳。
    同刘开祥教授一起工作过的人都知道，他从来不爱运动。为什么最近他突然成了操场上的积极分子？原来，他在思想革命运动中做了自我检查以后，对未来更充满了信心，他常笑着对人说：“现在我才是越活越年轻了！”他立志要“再为祖国工作三十年！”。这就是他最近积极锻炼身体的原因。（傅军）
    如今琵琶又共赏
    一天晚上，从北京医学院王叔咸教授的屋子里传出了一阵阵的琵琶声、笑声和掌声……。路过窗外的人不禁要停下来听听。原来，王叔咸教授是一个弹琵琶的能手，但过去他常常一个人埋头书斋，从来没有把自己的这一手擅长的琵琶弹给别人听过。有些人很想听听他弹琵琶，但是他谢绝说：“我又不是卖艺的。”
    如今，这位教授为什么在许多人面前弹起琵琶来呢？王叔咸对人们说：“在伟大的思想革命运动中，我丢掉了资产阶级个人主义包袱。现在正轻装走向社会主义，我的心情怎能不愉快呢！”
    教师合唱团
    不久前，北京大学五十多位教授、讲师、助教组成了一个“教师合唱团”。“东风压倒西风……”的嘹亮歌声经常响彻燕园。
    在这个合唱团里有八、九位教授，地质地理系主任侯仁之教授和物理系主任褚圣麟教授都是合唱团的积极分子。侯仁之高兴地对人说：“唱歌，用我过去的眼光来看，那是年轻人的事了，现在，我们不是和青年人唱得一样好听？”　（傅军）
    小统计
    北京三十四个高等学校十二万师生员工在双反运动中，从3月5日到4月18日，共贴出大字报七百七十二万四千七百张。平均每校贴二十二万七千一百九十七张，平均每人贴六十四张。贴大字报最多的学校是清华大学，共贴出二百七十万张，贴得最少的学校是中央美术学院，共贴出九千张。（附图片）
