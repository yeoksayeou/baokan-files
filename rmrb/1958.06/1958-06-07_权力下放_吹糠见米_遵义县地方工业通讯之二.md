Decentralization of Power, Seeing Rice When Blowing Chaff
　　——Zunyi County Local Industry Communication Two
　　Our reporters Zhou Jingyu Guo Longchun
    Comrades in Zunyi County like to use the four characters "Seeing Rice When Blowing Chaff" to describe the development speed and effect of local industries. If you ask: Why can we achieve the effect of "Seeing Rice When Blowing Chaff" so vigorously and enthusiastically? Their answer is: "Decentralization of power."
    Unleash the Ropes That Bind Us
    When comrades from the County Party Committee's Industry and Transportation Department talk about the benefits of decentralization, they are truly eloquent. Comrade Liu Shaoqian of the County Party Committee said: In the beginning, the county always wanted to keep many projects in its own hands, and dared not boldly hand them over to the districts and townships for fear that they would not be able to handle them well and waste funds. As a result, we were in a mess, unable to make progress; we had no raw materials, no labor, and no cadres. However, some district and township cadres had light burdens, and some were enthusiastic about industries run by agricultural cooperatives, but not very concerned about industries run by the county. The county repeatedly asked districts and townships to help solve the problem of raw materials and labor, but the districts often put the county's tasks in a secondary position.
    The County Party Committee studied this situation, examined the leadership's suspicion that district and township cadres could run industries, and believed that this idea was conservative and would constrain the enthusiasm of district and township cadres to run industries. Therefore, it determined a firm policy of decentralization, transferring twenty-nine enterprises with larger investments and more complex technologies to be directly managed by the county, and the remaining three hundred and forty-nine to the districts and townships. The specific methods are: 1. The county uniformly arranges projects and determines the investment amount for each project; 2. Limits the time to complete the infrastructure construction tasks; 3. Cadre allocation, worker mobilization, and raw material supply are all the responsibility of the districts and townships; 4. The profit sharing is stipulated as follows: 95% for the county and 5% for the district; for the excess, 60% goes to the district and 40% goes to the county, or all goes to the district and township; 5. The profits obtained by the districts and townships are only used for expanding and building new enterprises and shall not be used for other purposes.
    A Magic Pill with Many Benefits
    Sure enough, decentralization of power is like a magic pill, curing the disease and immediately taking effect. The cadres who were originally lacking were quickly replenished, the raw materials that were originally lacking were quickly solved, and those who originally had to run to the county to solve problems no longer ran to the county. This is a big change. According to statistics from the County Party Committee's Industry and Transportation Department: Before the decentralization of power, only thirteen factories and mines had completed infrastructure construction and put into production; within fifty days after decentralization, the number of factories and mines put into production increased to two hundred and six. Mao Po district, without any national investment, used the surplus labor of agricultural cooperatives and local raw materials to set up twenty-one factories and mines, which can produce more than 100,000 yuan worth of wealth for the country by the end of the year. The Nanbai Town People's Committee mobilized the masses to build a granular fertilizer factory in one night. A thatched house can shelter from the wind and rain and accommodate six or seven people to work.
    Decentralization of power has many benefits, which can be summarized as at least the following points:
    First, it can give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of districts and townships in running industries, and mobilize the financial and human resources of districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives to invest in local industries;
    Second, it can give full play to the role of "local technicians" and "local technology" to tap local material resources;
    Third, it can be closely integrated with the rural economy, serving agricultural production. Produce more of what is needed for agricultural production, and less of what is not needed. Produce more during slack farming seasons, and less or none during busy farming seasons;
    Fourth, it can save more funds. Generally speaking, the lower the level of the unit, the lower the requirements for factory buildings and non-productive construction, and the more economical it is to run factories and mines;
    Fifth, the county leadership can free up their hands to focus on key projects.
    Speaking of these benefits, the comrades of the County Party Committee's Industry and Transportation Department have a lot of feelings. They said that decentralization of power is indeed a way to liberate productive forces. As long as we boldly hand over some industrial projects to the districts and townships, the cadres of the districts and townships can not only run industries, but also run them very well.
    Good to Rest Under the Thatched Roof Under the Tree
    Another important experience to achieve "Seeing Rice When Blowing Chaff" is to adopt the method of simultaneous production and infrastructure construction, and first production and then infrastructure construction, carefully calculating and simplifying things to maximize the effectiveness of limited funds.
    In Zunyi, we visited several factories, some with forty or fifty people, and some with only five or six people. Compared with factories in big cities, these factories really don't look like factories. A thatched house with a stone mill, plus an ox and one or two workers to manage the flour sifting, is a flour mill; a pit dug on a hillside, opening up limestone, piled into the pit and burned into lime, is a lime factory. This kind of factory has no factory building at all. Some larger factories try to operate in the open air as much as possible, and those that cannot operate in the open air build a shed. Comrades in Shangji District put it well, "It's good to rest under the thatched roof under the tree, and good to build factories in broken houses." This sentence truly reflects their spirit of simplifying things when running factories.
    Patching and Mending "Snake Shedding Skin"
    The problem of funds was originally a difficult problem in running a factory. Because many factories adopted the method of patching and mending, "snake shedding skin" - simultaneous construction and production, the original difficult problem became relatively easy to solve. Example 1: There is a defluorinated phosphate fertilizer plant in Songlin District, which plans to build 40 kilns and requires an investment of 120,000 yuan. How can a district come up with 120,000 yuan? They adopted the method of simultaneous production and infrastructure construction, putting one kiln into production after it was built, and then immediately investing the profits from production into new construction. In this way, they only took out 20,000 yuan of capital to build ten kilns, producing 2,000 tons of defluorinated phosphate fertilizer, worth 50,000 yuan. Example 2: There is a sulfur factory in Sancha Township, with the infrastructure task of 40 stoves, requiring an investment of 100,000 yuan. They adopted the same method, spending 3,000 yuan to build six stoves, producing three tons of sulfur, worth more than 1,100 yuan.
    It can be seen from this that adopting the method of simultaneous production and infrastructure construction, expanding the capital accumulation of industry itself, and accelerating capital turnover is a way to solve the problem of financial difficulties. Zunyi County needs an investment of 6 million yuan this year. The county finance can provide 2.7 million yuan, the non-industrial system can provide 400,000 yuan, and 1.3 million yuan can be borrowed from the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. The shortage, in addition to requesting a portion of subsidies from higher authorities and borrowing a portion of savings deposits from banks, can be largely solved by relying on the accumulation of industry itself.
    Does borrowing 1.3 million yuan from the accumulation of agriculture have any impact on agriculture? Comrade Liu Shaoqian of the County Party Committee replied affirmatively: No impact. Every agricultural cooperative in Zunyi County has a public accumulation of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Today, the funds drawn by the county are less than 10% of the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. This year, the county is expected to increase grain production by 150 million jin, an increase of 47% compared to last year, and the number of hogs will increase to 800,000, an increase of 166% compared to last year. This is a very large income. Currently, all aspects are tightening up to support the development of industry. Next year, the county's key industries can be put into production to equip agriculture and further promote the development of agriculture.
    In general, there are difficulties and solutions. Decentralization of power is a solution, and simultaneous production and infrastructure construction is another solution. On the road to progress, as long as we resolutely rely on the masses, there will be more and better solutions.

　　权力下放  吹糠见米
　　——遵义县地方工业通讯之二
　　本报记者　周静宇　郭龙春
    遵义县的同志喜欢用“吹糠见米”四个字来形容地方工业的发展速度和效果。若问：为什么能够这样蓬蓬勃勃、轰轰烈烈收到“吹糠见米”之效？他们的答复是：“权力下放”。
    解开束缚自己的绳索
    县委工业交通部的同志谈起权力下放的好处时，真是滔滔不绝。县委刘绍乾同志说：开始，县里总想把许多项目揽在自己手里，不敢大胆地交给区、乡去办，唯恐他们办不好，浪费资金。结果，弄得自己手忙脚乱、踢打不开；要原料没有原料，要劳力没有劳力，要干部没有干部。而有些区、乡干部的担子却很轻松，有些人热中于农业社办工业，对于县办工业不大关心。县里多次要求区、乡帮助解决原料和劳动力问题，区里常常把县里的任务放在次要地位。
    县委研究了这个情况，检查了领导上怀疑区、乡干部能办工业的思想，认为这种思想是保守的，它会约束区、乡干部办工业的积极性，于是确定了坚决下放的方针，把投资较大、技术较复杂的二十九项企业由县直接管理，其余三百四十九项，全部放到区、乡。具体办法是：1、县统一安排项目，确定每个项目的投资额；2、限定时间完成基建任务；3、干部配备、工人调动以及原料供应，统由区、乡包干负责；4、上缴利润规定按比例分成：县95％，区5％；超额部分，60％归区，40％归县，或者全部归区乡；5、区乡所得利润只限于扩建和新建企业，不得移作他用。
    灵丹妙药好处很多
    果然，权力下放真像灵丹妙药，药到病除，立刻奏效。原来缺干部的很快就补上了，原来缺原料的很快就解决了，原来处处要县里解决问题的，现在不再跑县了，这是一个很大的变化。据县委工业交通部统计：权力下放以前，完成基建投入生产的厂矿只有十三个；下放后五十天时间内，投入生产的厂矿增加到二百零六个。茅坡区有七个乡不用国家投资一文钱，利用农业社多余劳动力和地方原料，办起了二十一个厂矿，到年底可为国家生产财富十多万。南白镇人民委员会动员群众力量在一个晚上就修建起一座颗粒肥料厂，一间茅草房能遮风蔽雨，容纳六、七个人工作。
    权力下放的好处很多，归纳起来至少有以下几点：
    第一、可以发挥区、乡办工业的主动性和积极性，动员区、乡和农业社的财力、人力投进到地方工业里来；
    第二、可以充分发挥“土技师”、“土技术”的作用，挖掘当地物质资源；
    第三、可以和农村经济紧密结合起来，为农业生产服务，农业生产上需要的就多生产，不需要的就不生产，农闲时多生产，农忙时少生产或者不生产；
    第四、可以更加节省资金。一般说，越是基层单位，对厂房和非生产性建设的要求就越低，办起厂矿来就越加节省；
    第五、县的领导方面可以腾出手来抓骨干项目。
    谈起这些好处，县委工业交通部的同志感想颇多。他们说，权力下放，确实是解放生产力的办法。只要大胆地把部分工业项目交给区、乡去办，区、乡的干部不仅能够办工业，而且办得很好。
    茅屋树下好息凉
    做到“吹糠见米”的另一条重要经验就是采取边生产、边基建，先生产、后基建的办法，精打细算，因陋就简，使有限的资金发挥最大的效能。
    在遵义，我们参观了好几个工厂，大的有四、五十人，小的有五、六个人。这些工厂如果同大城市的工厂比起来，实在不像工厂的样子。一间茅草屋安上一块石头磨子，加上一条牛和一两个管筛粉的工人就是面粉厂；一个山坡上挖上一个土坑，打开石灰岩，堆到坑里烧成石灰，这就是石灰厂。这种厂根本没有厂房。有些较大的厂子，凡是能够露天作业的尽量露天作业，不能露天作业的就搭个草棚。尚稽区的同志说得好，“茅屋树下好歇凉，破房旧屋好建厂”。这句话，确实反映了他们因陋就简的办厂精神。
    东拉西补“蛇脱皮”
    资金问题本来是办厂当中的一个困难问题。由于许多工厂采取东拉西补、“蛇脱皮”——边基建边生产的办法，原来困难的问题也就比较好办了。例子之一：松林区有个脱氟磷肥厂，计划建四十个窑，要投资十二万元。一个区怎么能拿出十二万元？他们采取了边生产、边基建的办法，建成一个窑就投入生产，接着把生产出来的利润，又立即投入到新的建设上去。这样，仅仅拿出两万元本钱建成十个窑，生产了脱氟磷肥二千吨，价值五万元。例子之二：三岔乡有个硫磺厂，基建任务是四十个炉子，要投资十万元。他们采取同样的办法，花了三千元就建成了六个炉子，生产了硫磺三吨，价值一千一百多元。
    由此可见，采取边生产、边基建的办法，扩大工业本身的资金积累，加速资金周转，是解决资金困难的一个门路。遵义县今年投资需要六百万元，县财政方面可拿出二百七十万元，非工业系统可拿出四十万元，从农业社的公共积累中可借用一百三十万元，不足的数字，除了请求上级补助一部分，向银行借一部分储蓄款外，依靠工业本身的积累，大体上可以解决。
    从农业的积累中借用一百三十万元对农业有无影响呢？县委刘绍乾同志肯定地回答：没有影响。遵义县的农业社那个都有公共积累五、六万元。今天，县里抽用的资金还不到农业社积累的10％。今年，全县预计粮食可增产一亿五千万斤，比去年增加47％，毛猪发展到八十万头，比去年增加166％，这是一笔很大的收入。目前各方面紧一点，支援办工业，明年县的骨干工业投入生产就可以装备农业，进一步促进农业的发展。
    总的说来，有困难也有办法，权力下放是个办法，边生产、边基建又是一个办法。在前进的道路上，只要坚决地依靠群众，还将会出现更多更好的办法。
