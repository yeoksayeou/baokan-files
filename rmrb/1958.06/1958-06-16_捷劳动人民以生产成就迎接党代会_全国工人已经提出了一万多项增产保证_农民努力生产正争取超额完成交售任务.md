Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The laboring people of Czechoslovakia are greeting the upcoming 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which will open on the 18th, with practical production achievements.

Since the beginning of this year, the laboring people in various regions have enthusiastically launched a mass socialist labor emulation campaign. To date, workers across the country have proposed more than 11,000 increase-production guarantees. For example, coal miners have proposed to overproduce more than 1.7 million tons of coal and reduce costs by approximately 40 million crowns (Czech currency). Power workers in 118 enterprises have proposed to overproduce 42 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, save 3,000 tons of fuel, and reduce costs by more than 12.8 million crowns. Many of these guarantees have already been realized. For instance, coal miners had already overproduced more than 1.65 million tons of coal by the end of May. The workers of the Spis iron mine in Slovakia originally guaranteed to increase production by 3,000 tons of iron ore. Due to everyone's hard work, they later raised the guarantee target to 9,000 tons, and this target was overfulfilled by the end of May.

Farmers in various regions are also working hard to increase production and have guaranteed to greatly overfulfill the sales tasks of agricultural products. As of June 11th, the farmers in the Banská Bystrica region of Slovakia had already fulfilled and overfulfilled the milk sales plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. Many agricultural cooperatives are actively taking various specific measures to strive to reach the 1960 production increase targets within this year. Farmers in various regions have also guaranteed to donate 1.5 million hours of voluntary labor to build agricultural projects and improve the appearance of towns and villages.

In the labor emulation campaign to welcome the Party Congress, young people are an active force. The savings movement they initiated is also being carried out very effectively in various places. On the eve of the opening of the Congress, many youth organizations also launched "Model Work Month" and "Model Work Week" campaigns, and attracted many veteran workers to participate. University students have also guaranteed to engage in voluntary labor in rural areas and mining areas during the summer vacation. Students from the Prague Agricultural College alone have guaranteed to complete 170,000 work hours of voluntary labor this year.

The preparations for the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party have significantly improved the political consciousness of the laboring people. In recent months, tens of thousands of people have been accepted into the Party, exceeding the total number of Party members developed throughout last year. Among the new Party members, the proportion of outstanding workers, agricultural cooperative members, and technical personnel has greatly increased. (Attached picture)

    捷劳动人民以生产成就迎接党代会
    全国工人已经提出了一万多项增产保证
    农民努力生产正争取超额完成交售任务
    新华社布拉格14日电　捷克斯洛伐克全国劳动人民正在以实际的生产成就迎接将在18日开幕的捷共第十一次代表大会。
    从今年年初以来，各地劳动人民就热情地展开了群众性的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。到目前为止，全国工人已经提出了一万一千多项增产保证。例如，煤矿工人提出要超额生产一百七十多万吨煤和降低成本约四千万克朗（捷币）。一百一十八个企业的动力工人提出要超额生产四千二百万度电、节约燃料三千吨和减少成本一千二百八十多万克朗。目前许多保证已经实现，例如煤矿工人在5月底就已经超额采煤一百六十五万吨以上。斯洛伐克的斯皮斯铁矿的工人们原先保证增产三千吨铁矿砂，由于大家发挥干劲，后来又把保证指标提高到九千吨，而这个指标还在5月底就已超额完成。
    各地的农民也努力增产，并且纷纷保证大大超额完成农产品的交售任务。到6月11日为止，斯洛伐克的班斯卡比斯特里查州的农民已经提前和超额完成了上半年的牛奶交售计划。许多农业合作社积极采取各种具体措施，力争在今年年内达到1960年的增产指标。各地农民还保证捐献一百五十万个小时的义务劳动来修建农业工程和改善乡镇面貌。
    在迎接党代表大会的劳动竞赛中，青年们是一支活跃的力量。他们发起的节约运动还在各地极有成效地开展。在代表大会开幕前夕，许多青年组织还发起了“模范工作月”和“模范工作周”运动，并且吸引了许多老工人参加。大学生们也保证在暑期去农村和矿区从事义务劳动。仅布拉格农学院的学生就保证要在今年内完成十七万个工时的义务劳动。
    捷共第十一次代表大会的准备工作显著地提高了劳动人民的政治觉悟。近几个月来，已经有成万的人被接受入党，超过了去年全年的发展党员数字。在新党员中，优秀的工人、农业合作社社员和技术人员的比重大大增加。（附图片）
