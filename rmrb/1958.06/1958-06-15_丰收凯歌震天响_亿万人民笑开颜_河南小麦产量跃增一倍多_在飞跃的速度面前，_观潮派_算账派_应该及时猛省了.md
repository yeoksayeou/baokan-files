Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th. Our correspondent reports: Henan Province's summer harvest has set a record of leaping forward at a rate of 123.6%, drawing a long and glorious red line on the production achievement comparison chart for the first season of the first year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan. The harvest of 20.6 billion jin of grain in one season, an increase of 11.4 billion jin compared to the same period last year, is the abundant fruit cultivated by the 48 million people of Henan under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction with a spirit of hard struggle.

Let the "Accounting Faction" do the math! According to statistics from the Henan Provincial Bureau of Statistics: last year, the total output of summer harvest crops in the province covering 80.9 million mu was 9.2 billion jin, with an average yield of 114 jin per mu. This year, both the total output and the yield per unit area have more than doubled. This year's summer harvest area is 83.35 million mu, with a total output of 20.6 billion jin and an average yield of 248 jin per mu. This year's total output increased by 123.6% compared to last year, and the yield per unit area increased by 117.5%. Let the "Accounting Faction" calculate the increase in production of the previously so-called "low-yield crop" wheat! Last year, the wheat harvest area in the province was 66.42 million mu, with a total output of 7.5 billion jin and an average yield of 113 jin per mu. This year, the wheat harvest area is 67.65 million mu, with a total output of 17.1 billion jin and an average yield of 254 jin per mu. This year's total output increased by 9.6 billion jin compared to last year, with an average yield increase of 141 jin per mu. May we ask, "Accounting Faction" and "Wait-and-See Faction," what else do you have to say in the face of the people's leap forward account, with a growth rate of more than 100 percent?

Facts prove that liberated productive forces can leap forward at a rocket-like speed. The fact that 122 counties and cities in Henan Province have universally achieved rapid growth records this year eloquently illustrates this point. Among them, 66 counties and cities increased production by one to two times compared to last year. The average yield of Meng County, Yanshi, Bo'ai, and the cities of Anyang and Shangqiu jumped over 500 jin in one fell swoop. The unit area yield in Anyang, Hui County, Lushan, Xiangcheng, and the cities of Luoyang and Nanyang also reached more than 400 jin. In the province, 76 townships and 1,778 agricultural cooperatives achieved the production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule in one season's harvest. Forty-one counties and cities increased production by 50% to 100%, and fifteen counties and cities increased production by 20% to 50%. There is not a single county in Henan Province that has not increased production.

High-yield and bumper harvest miracles are everywhere. According to surveys, every county has fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. In Xinxiang and Luoyang prefectures alone, there are more than 31,000 mu of such fields. During these days of celebrating bumper harvests, good news is constantly pouring in from all over Henan, with high-yield records exceeding one another. In the Si Gao Village Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County, north of the Yellow River, 1.7 mu of wheat yielded an average of 3,259 jin and 12 liang per mu. In Suiping County, Xinyang Prefecture, the agricultural cooperative named "Satellite" released three high-yield "satellites" in a row: one with a yield of over 2,000 jin per mu on ten mu, one with a yield of 3,248 jin per mu on three mu, and another with a yield of 3,530 jin and 7.5 liang per mu on 2.94 mu. This is the highest record found so far. These miracles are the starting point for people with soaring enthusiasm to create even greater miracles. These miracles have caused a sensation among hundreds of millions of people.

Please, dear reader, open a map of Henan Province, and let me answer another question. Under what natural conditions were these increased production facts and high-yield records achieved? Meng County and Bo'ai, with yields of over 500 jin per mu in the whole county, are located at the southern foot of the Taihang Mountains north of the Yellow River. The output of these two counties crossed the Yellow River in one season. In Lushi County, with thin soil and many rocks, the average yield increased by 2.3 times compared to last year. In Minquan County, a sandy area with very poor soil in the old course of the Yellow River in eastern Henan, the yield per unit area also jumped by more than one time. Last year, the Chongzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Changyuan County had 40 mu of alkaline land with a yield of 100 jin per mu, but this year, each mu harvested 600 jin, and two mu yielded 1,387 jin per mu. Xiangcheng County, which has suffered from disasters for several years, has also become a high-yield county this year, with an average yield increase of more than one time throughout the county. Last year, the lowest yield in the province was in Mianchi County, with an average yield of only 57 jin per mu, but this year's yield increased by 2.6 times.

Now, more than 48 million people in Henan Province are joyfully continuing to leap forward. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee held a "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest and Advancing in Victory" broadcast meeting on the evening of the 13th. At the meeting, Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor of the Province, made a report, comprehensively summarizing the great achievements of the people of the province in working hard throughout the winter and spring under the illumination of the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. He systematically analyzed the reasons for the bumper harvest, pointing out that Henan's wheat harvest was a victory for the general line and a failure for the "Wait-and-See Faction." In his report, he called on the people of the province to advance in victory, continue to go all out and aim high in the spirit of "looking at next year this year" and "continuous revolution," and strive for greater production achievements in the autumn and next year. He represented the people of the province in paying tribute to the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and expressing gratitude to the fraternal provinces that supported Henan Province. After listening to the broadcast, more than 20 million people in the province were even more motivated. Many prefectures and counties discussed the broadcast on the spot, and all expressed their determination to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, make persistent efforts, advance in victory, and strive for greater harvests in the autumn and next year. After listening to the broadcast, cadres and people in Luoyang Prefecture proposed ten measures to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn. (Attached image)

    丰收凯歌震天响　亿万人民笑开颜
    河南小麦产量跃增一倍多
    在飞跃的速度面前，“观潮派”“算账派”应该及时猛省了
    新华社郑州14日电　本社记者报道：河南省夏收以增产123.6％的跃进速度的纪录，在我国第二个五年计划第一年第一个季节的生产成绩比较表上，划上了一条长长的光荣的红线。一季收获二百零六亿斤粮食，比去年同期增产一百一十四亿斤，这是河南四千八百万人民，在社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，以苦战精神培育出来的丰盛果实。
    让“算账派”来算账吧！据河南省统计局的统计：去年全省八千零九十万亩夏收作物，总产量是九十二亿斤，单位面积平均亩产量是一百一十四斤；今年总产量和单位面积产量都翻了一翻以上，今年夏收面积是八千三百三十五万亩，总产量是二百零六亿斤，平均单位面积亩产量是二百四十八斤。今年总产量比去年的增长速度达到123.6％，单位面积产量增长速度是117.5％。再让“算账派”算一下过去所谓“低产作物”小麦的增产账吧！去年全省小麦收获面积是六千六百四十二万亩，总产量七十五亿斤，平均亩产一百一十三斤；今年小麦收获面积是六千七百六十五万亩，总产量一百七十一亿斤，平均亩产二百五十四斤。今年比去年总产量增加九十六亿斤，平均每亩产量增产一百四十一斤。请问“算账派”“观潮派”们，你们在人民的这笔以百分之一百以上的增长速度的跃进账面前，还有什么话可说呢？
    事实证明：解放了的生产力是能够以快似火箭的速度向前跃进。河南省有一百二十二个县、市，今年普遍获得快速度的增产纪录，就雄辩地说明了这个问题。其中，有六十六个县、市比去年增产一倍到两倍以上。这里面有孟县、偃师、博爱三个县和安阳、商丘两个市的平均产量，一蹴跳过了五百斤；安阳、辉县、鲁山、襄城四县和洛阳、南阳两市单位面积产量也达到四百斤以上；全省有七十六个乡和一千七百七十八个农业社，一季收获的粮食就提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的生产指标。增产五成到一倍的有四十一个县、市，增产二成到五成的有十五个县、市，没有增产的县，在河南省找不到一个。
    高额丰产的奇闻奇迹，处处皆有。据调查，每个县都有了亩产千斤田。仅新乡、洛阳两个专区千斤田就有三万一千多亩。这些在喜庆丰产的日子里，河南各地捷报频传，高额丰产纪录一个高一个。黄河北边的安阳县四高村农业社，一亩七分多小麦，平均亩产三千二百五十九斤十二两。信阳专区的遂平县以“卫星”命名的农业社，连续放出了三个高产“卫星”：一个是十亩单产在两千斤以上，一个是三亩多地每亩产量三千二百四十八斤，另一个是二亩九分四每亩产量三千五百三十斤七两半。这是到现在为止所发现的最高纪录。这些奇迹，是干劲冲天的人民将创造更大的奇迹的起点。这些奇迹轰动了亿万人民。
    请读者最好打开河南省的地图，让记者再回答一个问题。这些增产事实和高产纪录的出现是在什么自然条件取得呢？全县单位面积产量在五百斤以上的孟县、博爱位于黄河以北的太行山南麓，这两个县的产量一季就跨过了黄河。土薄石厚的卢氏县，平均亩产比去年增产二点三倍。豫东黄河故道土质很差的沙区民权县，单位产量也跃进一翻多。长垣县冲寨农业社去年有四十亩碱地每亩产量一百斤，今年每亩收获了六百斤，其中有二亩每亩产量达到一千三百八十七斤。几年来连年受灾的项城县，今年也变成了丰产县，全县平均产量增加一倍多。去年全省产量最低的是渑池县，平均亩产只有五十七斤，今年产量增加了二点六倍。
    现在，河南省四千八百多万人民，正欢欣鼓舞地继续跃进，中共河南省委和河南省人民委员会，于13日晚举行了“庆祝丰收，乘胜前进”的广播大会。会上，省委第一书记、省长吴芝圃做了报告，他全面地总结了全省人民在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线灯塔照耀下，苦战一冬，大干一春，获得空前丰收的伟大成果。他系统地分析了丰收的原因，指出河南的小麦丰收是总路线的胜利，是“观潮派”的失败。他在报告中号召全省人民，乘胜前进，本着“今年看明年”和“不断革命”的精神，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游为争取今年秋季和明年更大的生产成绩而奋斗。他代表全省人民向中共中央、毛主席、国务院的英明领导致敬，向支援河南省的兄弟省致谢。全省两千多万人听了广播以后，干劲更足了。好多专区和县，听完了广播当场讨论，各地在讨论中都表示要响应省委的号召，再接再厉，乘胜前进，争取秋季和明年更大的丰收。洛阳专区的干部和人民，在收听广播后，就提出十项争取秋季丰收的措施。（附图片）
