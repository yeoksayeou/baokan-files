    Wooden Machine Shows its Might, Foot-powered Becomes Electric
    (Our Newspaper, reporter Li Jiuzhe) Workers at the Nanchang Jianye Dyeing and Weaving Factory, such as Hu Youshui, overcame all difficulties and obstacles to transform the manually operated, foot-powered wooden looms into electric looms, turning "waste" that was about to enter a museum into modern machines.
    Hu Youshui, in his thirties, had been working on manually operated wooden looms for ten years. He deeply understood the heavy workload of this operation. In order to alleviate this heavy physical labor, he proposed twice, in 1951 and 1956, to convert the foot-powered looms into electric looms. However, some leaders of the superior authorities at the time said: "Don't you do that; if you use electricity on this kind of machine, it will fly into the sky." "This kind of wooden machine is about to be eliminated and enter the museum; there is no need to modify it."
    This year, the Party's instructions to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results gave him tremendous strength. He was no longer constrained by these rigid rules and conservative ideas. With the support of the factory's Party and government leaders, Hu Youshui and Luo Weicheng, Hu Jinqiu and several others first modified two looms. The effect was unexpectedly good. The wooden machine was steadily operated by the motor, and the shuttle ticked at a speed of 160 times per minute. The two pedals originally operated by foot under the wooden frame now automatically moved up and down. Several workers stood proudly next to the machine, issuing commands to it. Hu Youshui's confidence increased greatly when he saw this situation. The three of them modified eight more machines in one go.
    There were considerable difficulties in converting the manually operated wooden machine into an electric one. Several major machine parts required for the modification, such as pulleys, V-belts, short shafts, and balls, were not readily available in the factory. The workers searched everywhere for old materials to modify, or used wooden products instead, or ran to relevant factories to borrow them. Without a lathe, they borrowed one from the Xinhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Hu Youshui and others used it at night while others used it during the day. They had the shaft, but no copper bushings to install the shaft, so they made wooden bushings, which worked very well.
    Not long ago, the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on technological revolution at the Jianye Factory, calling on all workers in the city to learn from the fearless communist style of the Jianye Dyeing and Weaving Factory workers. Hu Youshui spoke at the meeting. He said that foot-powered wooden looms do not need to be sent to the museum; we have fully utilized them.

### 木机抖威风　脚踏变电动

    木机抖威风　脚踏变电动
    本报讯　记者李久泽报道：南昌建业染织厂工人胡佑水等，冲破一切困难和阻挠，把用手工操作的脚踏木头织机改装成了电动织布机，使快进博物馆的“废物”变成了现代机器。
    三十多岁的胡佑水在手工操作的木头织布机上已经工作了十年。他深知这种操作的繁重。为了减轻这种繁重的体力劳动，1951年和1956年他曾两次提出把脚踏织布机改装成电动织布机的建议。但是，当时上级机关有的领导人说：“你们不要搞，这种机子用电一带就会飞上天的。”“这种木机子就要被淘汰，快进博物馆了，用不着改装了。”
    今年，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的指示给了他巨大的力量，他再不受这清规戒律和保守思想的束缚了；胡佑水和罗维城、胡金秋几个人在工厂党政领导的支持下，首先改装了两台织布机，效果是出乎意外的好，木头机子被马达带动着稳稳当当地操作着，梭子以每分钟一百六十次的速度滴滴答答的响动着，木机身底下原来用脚踏的两块踏板现在自动地一上一下。几个工人神气活现地站在机旁对机器发号施令。胡佑水看到这种情况，信心倍增。三个人一气又改装了八台。
    把手工操作的木头机子改成电动的，困难相当多。改装用的几项主要机料，如皮带盘、三角皮带、短轴、弹子等，厂里都没有现成的，工人们就到处寻找旧材料来改制，或者是以木制品代替，或者是跑遍有关的工厂求借。没有车床，他们就到新华染织厂借用，人家白天用，胡佑水等几个人就晚上用。轴有了，但没有安装轴的铜婆司，他们用木头做木婆司，结果很好。
    不久以前，中共南昌市委在建业厂召开了技术革命的现场会议，号召全市职工学习建业染织厂职工这种大无畏的共产主义风格。胡佑水在会上讲了话。他说，脚踏木头织布机用不着送进博物馆了，我们已经充分把它利用起来了。
