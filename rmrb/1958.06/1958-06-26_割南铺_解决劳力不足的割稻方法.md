	"Ge Nanpu": A Rice Harvesting Method to Solve Labor Shortages

	The Yueyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province is promoting a mass-created "Ge Nanpu" rice harvesting method throughout the county.

	The characteristic of this harvesting method is that when the rice matures to 90%, it is harvested, bundled, and transported back to be stacked. It is then threshed with stone rollers or threshing machines during slack farming seasons, instead of using threshing barrels. Yueyang County has more than 420,000 mu of early rice this year. If this method is promoted and tools are vigorously reformed, the county will be able to save and transfer more than 200,000 workdays.

	The "Ge Nanpu" harvesting method is a harvesting method that farmers in Xujiapai Township, Yueyang have used for more than a thousand years. According to folk tales, during the Huang Chao uprising, some farmers settled here. Due to a severe lack of labor and the inability to rush harvest the ripened rice, the "Ge Nanpu" method was adopted. Later, it gradually became a common harvesting habit for local farmers.

	It has a complete set of operating methods. When harvesting, use a large sickle to cut evenly, without lodging ears, with neat cuts, and uniform stubble, making it easy to spread for drying. The bundles of rice stalks are dried and laid out in a fish-scale pattern for easy bundling and transportation. The size of the bundle is about thirty catties. During transportation, use ox carts or hand carts. Manual transportation uses shoulder poles. Stacking is generally divided into large, medium, and small stacks. Large stacks have more than 4,000 bundles, are 18 chi high, and 6-7 chi in diameter; medium stacks have 2,000 bundles, are 15 chi high, and 5-6 chi in diameter; small stacks have more than 1,000 bundles, are about 10 chi high, and 4-5 chi in diameter. This standard has a certain scientific basis, otherwise the stack will collapse. Before stacking, a location must be selected and an earthen platform of the same size as the stack must be made, about 1.5 chi high, and covered with a layer of straw before stacking. When stacking, the center of the stack should be filled and compacted, one layer at a time, and it must be tamped flat. When finishing the stack, the rice ears of the top two layers should face outwards, and the place where the bundles are tied should press down on the stack, forming a pot-bottom shape, and cover with straw. Then, dig ditches around the base of the stack to drain water and prevent the stack from collapsing and rotting. The threshing method is also quite special. Four general laborers and two oxen can thresh 5,000 catties of grain in one day using a stone roller, which is twice as efficient as threshing with threshing barrels.

	This harvesting method has always been popular among the masses. They believe that it has the following advantages: high efficiency, able to adjust busy and slack periods, and guarantee timely transplanting of late rice; both full and semi-able-bodied laborers can be involved in harvesting, without being restricted by the labor required for threshing barrels; it can thoroughly achieve careful threshing and harvesting; the rice can be stored for a long time, which can solve the difficulty of insufficient grain storage; and the rice straw, after being stacked, has sufficient nutrients and a fragrant taste, making it good feed for cattle.

### “割南铺”解决劳力不足的割稻方法

    “割南铺”解决劳力不足的割稻方法
    中共湖南岳阳县委正在全县推广一种群众创造的“割南铺”的收割稻谷方法。
    这种收割方法的特点是，在稻谷成熟到九成时，割后束成捆子，运回来垒成堆，等到农闲时再用石滚或打稻机打，不用扮桶打。岳阳县今年有四十二万多亩早稻，如果推行这个办法，并大力改革工具，全县将可以节省和调剂出二十多万个工。
    “割南铺”的收割方法，是岳阳许家牌乡农民一千多年来沿用的一种收割方法。据民间传说，是黄巢起义时，部分农民在这里安家落户后，由于劳力非常缺乏，稻谷成熟了，不能抢收回来，才采用了“割南铺”的办法，以后逐渐成为当地农民一种普遍的收割习惯。
    它有一套完整的操作方法。在收割时用大镰子割，做到割得齐，不倒穗，刀口齐，禾蔸齐，便于铺晒。禾把晒干，放成鱼鳞行铺，便于打捆装运。捆的大小约三十斤左右。运时以牛车或人力车拉，人运以架子挑。垒堆一般分大、中、小三种垒法，大垒四千捆以上，堆高一丈八尺，直径六——七尺；中垒两千捆、堆高一丈五尺，直径五——六尺；小垒一千捆以上，堆高一丈左右，直径四——五尺。这个标准有一定的科学根据，否则就要倒堆。垒堆以前，还要选好地方，做成同堆大小一样的土墩，高一尺五寸左右，铺上一层稻草再堆。垒堆时，堆心要填满踩紧，垫一层，垫一层，要踩得平。收堆时，堆尖两层禾尾朝外，齐打捆的地方压堆，收成锅底顶，盖上稻草，然后在堆脚四周抽沟撇水，防止倒堆烂堆。打晒的办法也较特别，用四个一般劳动力和两条牛，用石滚打一天能打五千斤谷，比扮桶打的工效高两倍。
    这种收割方法，一直受到群众欢迎。他们认为有如下好处：工效高，能调剂忙闲，保证及时插晚稻；全劳动力和半劳力都可以投入收割，不受扮桶等使用劳力的限制；能够彻底做到细打细收；稻谷贮藏的时间久，可解决谷库不足的困难；稻草经过垒堆，养分足，味道清香，是耕牛的好饲料。
