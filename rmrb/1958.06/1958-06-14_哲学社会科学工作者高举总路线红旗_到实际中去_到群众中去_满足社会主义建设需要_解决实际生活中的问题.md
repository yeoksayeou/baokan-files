(Xinhua News Agency, 13th) To plant the red flag of the General Line in every corner of philosophy and social science research, and to strive to complete the leap forward targets of various research tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them - this is the main spirit of the second standing committee enlarged meeting held by the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the 11th. More than 50 people attended the meeting, including members of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences and heads of affiliated research institutions.

Pan Zinian, deputy director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, spoke at the meeting on the issue of implementing the General Line in the field of philosophy and social sciences. He pointed out that in order to implement the General Line and fulfill and overfulfill the established leap forward targets, every researcher must first further emancipate their minds in conjunction with the rectification campaign, break superstitions, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Pan Zinian said that in philosophy and social science research, it is also necessary to resolutely implement the policy of linking theory with practice, so that research work is tempered by actual life, meets practical needs, and does not deviate from actual struggles. The view that going down to the grassroots to deepen one's understanding of life contradicts research work is superficial, or even wrong. Every philosophy and social science researcher should conduct research according to the needs of the country and socialist construction. Satisfying the needs of socialist construction and solving the problems raised in actual life is the basic link in implementing the General Line in the field of philosophy and social sciences. Pan Zinian said that it is also necessary to strengthen theoretical criticism in philosophy and social sciences, and to constantly and consciously struggle against revisionism, dogmatism and other incorrect ideas and writing styles. To achieve more, faster, better and more economical results in research work, it is also necessary to follow the mass line, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and open up a new and broad road for philosophy and social science research. The method of combining senior, intermediate, and junior research work can also be applied in philosophy and social science research.

Liu Daosheng, deputy director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, and department members Jian Bozan, Yu Guangyuan, Feng Zhi, and others also spoke at the meeting. Liu Daosheng and Jian Bozan mainly talked about how to relate to reality and emphasize the present over the past in the study of history and other disciplines that are far from reality. Liu Daosheng said that the further the research object is from real life, the more easily the issue of linking with reality is overlooked. Linking with reality in the research of these disciplines mainly refers to what viewpoint and purpose to use for research, and how to make the past serve the present. Only by using the Marxist-Leninist and people's mass viewpoint to study history can we correctly understand history and make the past serve the present. Jian Bozan said that some bourgeois historical scholars pride themselves on historical materials and textual research. Marxist-Leninist historians do not despise historical materials, but we oppose using historical materials to scare people. The important thing is that the bourgeois ideology must be opposed. In his speech, Yu Guangyuan pointed out that the so-called "backwardness of China's philosophy and social sciences" is without any basis. In recent years, China's philosophy and social sciences have developed greatly. On a national scale, the formation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction is a major development of Marxism-Leninism. The source of philosophy and social sciences lies in the people. Philosophy and social science researchers should also go to the people to "collect folk songs" like literary and art workers, study the advanced deeds emerging from the masses, maintain close contact with advanced figures among the masses, and promote the advanced ideas among the masses. Only in this way can the thinking of scientists be advanced.

Guo Moruo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke before the meeting concluded. Guo Moruo said that every scientific worker should implement political leadership, plant red flags and pull out white flags, and exert their greatest efforts in order to contribute to the realization of the General Line. It is necessary to constantly and consciously revolutionize oneself; only being red can guarantee expertise. Guo Moruo pointed out that the decisive factor for the self-transformation of scientific workers is labor training. He said that his "cursory tour" of the rural areas of Huailai this time was truly something he had never seen or heard before. He was surprised to see farmers using cow dung to feed fat pigs, and wrote the poem "Science is not far away, it is right next to the pigsty" to praise this. He said that for us, the most important thing is to learn from the people's spirit of hard work and selflessness. The best way for scientists to break superstitions and emancipate their minds is to go down and take a look. Guo Moruo also pointed out that in order to implement the General Line and achieve the leap forward targets, a series of specific measures must be taken in terms of organization and systems to ensure it. He suggested formulating systems and specific methods for scientific personnel to deepen their understanding of life.

Based on everyone's speeches, the meeting decided to formulate various specific measures and study and resolve issues such as cooperation and the combination of senior, intermediate, and junior research work with relevant departments. The meeting also passed a resolution suggesting that the Chinese Academy of Sciences revoke the membership of rightists Xiang Da and Shen Zhiyuan in the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and all responsible positions they previously held.

    哲学社会科学工作者高举总路线红旗
    到实际中去  到群众中去
    满足社会主义建设需要  解决实际生活中的问题
    据新华社13日讯  把总路线的红旗插遍哲学社会科学研究工作的各个角落，争取提前和超额完成各项研究工作的跃进指标，这是中国科学院哲学社会科学部11日举行的第二次常委扩大会议的主要精神。出席这次会议的有哲学社会科学部委员和所属各研究机构负责人共五十多人。
    哲学社会科学部副主任潘梓年在会上就哲学社会科学领域中贯彻总路线问题发了言。他指出，为了贯彻总路线，完成和超额完成已经制定的跃进指标，每个研究工作人员首先必须结合整风进一步解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢讲、敢做的共产主义风格。潘梓年说，在哲学社会科学研究工作中，还必须坚决贯彻理论联系实际的方针，要使研究工作受到实际生活的洗炼，满足实际的需要，不脱离实际斗争。那种认为到下边去深入生活同研究工作有矛盾的看法是肤浅的，甚至是错误的。每个哲学社会科学研究人员应当根据国家和社会主义建设的需要来进行研究。满足社会主义建设的需要，解决实际生活中提出的问题是在哲学社会科学领域中贯彻总路线的基本环节。潘梓年说，还必须加强哲学社会科学方面的理论批判工作，经常自觉地同修正主义，同教条主义等不正确的思想和文风进行斗争。要在研究工作中实现多快好省，还必须走群众路线，充分发挥群众的智慧，为哲学社会科学研究开辟一条新的广阔的道路。在哲学社会科学研究中同样可以运用高级、中级、初级研究工作相结合的方法。
    哲学社会科学部副主任刘导生，学部委员翦伯赞、于光远、冯至等都在会上发了言。刘导生和翦伯赞主要谈到了在同现实距离较远的史学等学科的研究中如何联系实际和厚今薄古的问题。刘导生说，研究的对象离现实生活越远，联系实际的问题就越容易被忽视。在这些学科的研究中联系实际，主要是指用什么观点、为什么目的进行研究，如何使古为今用。只有用马克思列宁主义的、人民群众的观点来研究历史，才能正确认识历史并使古为今用。翦伯赞说。有些资产阶级历史学者以史料、考据而自恃。马克思列宁主义的历史学家并不轻视史料，但是我们反对拿史料来吓唬人，重要的问题是资产阶级的思想观点必须反掉。于光远在发言中指出，所谓“中国的哲学社会科学落后论”是没有任何根据的。几年以来，中国的哲学社会科学有了很大的发展。就全国范围来说，党的社会主义建设总路线的形成就是马克思列宁主义的一个重大发展。哲学社会科学的源泉在于人民群众。哲学社会科学研究工作人员也应当像文艺工作者那样，到人民群众中去“采风”，要研究群众中涌现的先进事迹，同群众中的先进人物密切联系，发扬群众中的先进思想，只有这样，科学家的思想才能先进。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在会议结束以前发了言。郭沫若说，每个科学工作者都要实行政治挂帅，插红旗拔白旗，拿出最大的力量，以期对实现总路线有所贡献。要不断地自觉革命，只有红才能保证专。郭沫若指出，对于科学工作者的自我改造具有决定意义的事情是劳动锻炼。他谈到，他这次到怀来地区农村“走马观花”真是见所未见，闻所未闻。他看到农民用牛粪喂肥猪，惊诧不止，便写了“科学不在远，就在猪圈旁”的诗来歌颂这件事。他说，对于我们来说，最重要的是要学习人民群众那种实干精神和忘我精神。科学家们要破除迷信，解放思想，最好的办法就是下去看看。郭沫若还指出，为了贯彻总路线，实现跃进指标，还必须在组织、制度上采取一系列的具体措施保证。他建议制定科学人员深入生活的制度和具体办法。
    根据大家的发言，会议决定制定各项具体措施，并同有关部门研究解决协作和高级、中级、初级研究工作的结合等问题。这次会议还通过一项决定，建议中国科学院撤销右派分子向达、沈志远的中国科学院哲学社会科学部委员和他们以前担任的一切负责职务。
