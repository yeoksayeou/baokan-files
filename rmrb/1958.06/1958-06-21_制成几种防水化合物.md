    Several Waterproof Compounds Developed

    How to protect buildings from moisture, how to keep carved monuments vibrant and beautiful for decades, and how to give glass and metal strong corrosion resistance are all questions of interest to people. Several waterproof compounds recently developed by Soviet scientists have solved these problems. The waterproof capabilities of these compounds are extremely strong. For example, if an item made of waterproof material is placed in water and removed after twenty-four hours, it will still be as dry as it was before being submerged. If waterproof compounds are used to impregnate building materials, paper, leather, various fabrics, fishing ropes, nautical charts, etc., these items will have water resistance and their service life will be extended.

    制成几种防水化合物
    如何使楼房不受潮湿影响，如何使雕刻的纪念碑在数十年内仍然保持它原有的鲜艳和美观，如何使玻璃和金属具有很强的抗腐蚀性，这是人们所感兴趣的问题。苏联科学家最近研究出的几种防水化合物把这些问题解决了。这些化合物的防水能力是非常强的。如将用防水物质制成的物品放在水内，二十四小时后取出，它仍然和未下水时一样干燥。如用防水化合物来浸润建筑材料、纸张、皮革、各种织物、捕鱼缆索、领航图等，这些物品就具有抗水性，使用时间也得到延长。
