    Pakistan's Economic Situation
    Duo Sheng
    According to materials disclosed by Pakistani newspapers, the current financial and economic situation of this young republic is indeed very difficult. Especially in the last six months, under the influence of the deepening American economic crisis, Pakistan's economy has further deteriorated.
    Main Problems Existing in Recent Years
    The main problems in Pakistan's economy in recent years have been: huge fiscal deficits, inflation, severe food shortages, rising prices, and the impoverishment of the broad masses of working people.
    Since the Pakistani government signed the US-Pakistan military treaty in 1954 and joined military blocs such as the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact, its military spending has increased year by year. According to official Pakistani figures, in the "treasury budget" of the Pakistani central government, military spending accounted for 639 million rupees in 1954-1955, 769 million in 1955-1956, 790 million in 1956-1957, increased to 793 million in 1957-1958, and further increased to 808 million rupees in 1958-1959 (plus the openly declared "national defense construction" expenditure in the "capital budget," this year's military spending will exceed 1 billion rupees). The percentage of military spending in the "treasury budget" also increased from 56% in 1954-1955 to about 59% in recent years. One of the bad consequences of huge military expenditures, plus hundreds of millions of administrative expenses and other non-productive expenditures, is a huge fiscal deficit. According to Pakistani newspaper reports, of the 3.3 billion rupees in total revenue in the 1958-1959 fiscal budget, about 22.5% relied on foreign aid (including foreign debt), and 27% was solved by various forms of domestic debt. This means that the actual deficit in the new budget accounts for about 49% of its total revenue.
    In order to make up for the fiscal deficit, in addition to relying on foreign aid and domestic debt, the Pakistani government has also continued to issue currency. In the past three or four years, about 300 million rupees (or slightly less) of currency was issued each year, but last year 454 million rupees were issued, exceeding any previous year. It is worth pointing out here that from 1947 to the end of 1957, currency growth was about doubled, but during the same period, Pakistan's total national economic income only increased by about 7%.
    Pakistan is an agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for 90% of the country's total population, and agricultural output accounting for about 90% of the total national economic income. However, feudal relations of production seriously hinder the development of agricultural productivity. In addition, past governments have implemented a policy of military expansion and have not achieved much in terms of economic construction, especially in flood control and water conservancy. In recent years, there have been successive water and drought disasters. Therefore, since 1953, Pakistan has needed to import large quantities of food almost every year. In 1956 and 1957 alone, it imported two million tons of grain, using 450 million rupees of its own foreign exchange and gold reserves, and also using 650 million rupees of foreign aid.
    Due to insufficient supply of materials and inflation, coupled with the stimulation of food shortages and artificial factors such as hoarding and smuggling, the prices of daily necessities in Pakistan rose by about 60% in 1957 compared with 1956. This year, after the Pakistani central government announced an increase in taxes, prices rose by another 20% within a few days. According to Pakistani newspaper reports, from 1947 to the end of 1957, prices rose by an average of three times (the market price of grain rose by about four times), but during the same period, the wages of the vast majority of Pakistani workers only increased by about 20%. Therefore, the semi-official Pakistani newspaper also admitted that the continuous rise in prices has seriously affected the lives of the people, "has made the Pakistani people increasingly impoverished" and has promoted an increase in strike incidents and "the turbulence of social order."
    The Impact of the American Economic Crisis
    Just as Pakistan's financial and economic problems were becoming increasingly difficult, the United States experienced an economic crisis. Many senior Pakistani officials and business people have recently repeatedly pointed out that the American economic crisis "has brought new difficulties to Pakistan," first and foremost "seriously hitting Pakistan's foreign trade."
    In Pakistan's national economy, foreign trade occupies a very important position. Foreign trade income accounts for about 10% of Pakistan's total national economic income. Moreover, about one-third or more of the Pakistani government's "treasury budget" relies on tariffs each year. When foreign trade shrinks and tariff revenue decreases accordingly, it often leads to fiscal deficits. Pakistan mainly relies on exporting agricultural cash crops such as cotton and jute to earn foreign exchange, which it exchanges for the machinery it needs (including parts replenishment), various industrial raw materials, industrial fuels, and many light industrial products. When export trade encounters difficulties, the Pakistani government often takes measures to restrict imports in order to reduce the deficit in international payments. But one of the consequences is to aggravate the shortage of materials, thereby stimulating price increases and causing insufficient operation and shutdowns of domestic industrial enterprises.
    Therefore, Pakistani business people and many newspapers believe that the impact of the current American economic crisis on Pakistan's foreign trade is a very serious problem. They particularly resent the fact that in order to export the economic crisis, the United States "is dumping American cotton and other 'surplus' materials at extremely competitive prices" and "is subsidizing countries that purchase American goods by providing subsidies, aid, and loans, etc.," "without considering the serious damage these measures bring to other countries that rely on trade."
    According to Pakistani newspaper reports, the American economic crisis has already had the following effects on Pakistan: (1) After the United States adopted the means of providing subsidies and dumping "surplus" materials, "countries that have always purchased Pakistani cotton, such as France, Japan, West Germany, and the United Kingdom, have greatly reduced the quantity of Pakistani cotton purchased," resulting in 400,000 bales of Pakistani cotton still "waiting for export" by May this year, but no one is interested. (2) More than one million bales of jute (as of May) originally planned for export have not been able to find customers. (3) The export trade volume in January this year decreased by 26% compared with the same period last year, and in February this year, it decreased by another 37% compared with January, of which tea exports decreased by 80% compared with January this year, leather and other exports decreased by 72%, and cotton cloth decreased by 70%. (4) Due to market problems and competition, the prices of Pakistani export commodities continue to fall. For example, wool prices have fallen by about 50%, tea has fallen by 20%, and cotton has fallen by 10%-20%. In the past, Pakistan's wool exports to the United States accounted for about 55% of Pakistan's total annual wool production (wool exports to the United Kingdom accounted for another 27%). However, given that the United States and the United Kingdom have greatly reduced the quantity of Pakistani wool purchased this year, the Pakistan Wool Merchants Association submitted a memorandum to the government in April, pointing out that wool exports earned 100 million rupees in foreign exchange last year, but may decrease to less than 40 million rupees this year. The Pakistan Tea Exporters Association also recently estimated that the foreign exchange that can be earned from tea exports this year may decrease by 50% compared with last year.
    Pakistan's "Today's News" recently wrote in a commentary after reviewing the situation in recent months that the facts in recent times have proved that due to the American economic crisis and the subsequent economic recession in other Western countries, "Pakistan's economy has fallen into an extremely embarrassing situation."
    Demands of Various Parties and Public Opinion
    Faced with the above situation, all parties and all strata in Pakistan believe that "it is necessary to get rid of the current economic difficulties." They are all demanding that the government change its domestic and foreign policies to varying degrees. The National People's Party advocates that externally, it should withdraw from all military treaties, "liberate itself from the rule of American aid," implement an independent foreign policy of peace and neutrality, develop trade with Eastern and Western countries on the same conditions, and strive to obtain unconditional assistance from both sides; internally, it should drastically reduce military spending, concentrate its efforts on economic construction, abolish the land ownership of landlords, and take effective measures to improve the lives of the broad masses of people. Bashani, chairman of the National People's Party, told reporters on May 15 that past governments "had assured us that forming an alliance with Western countries and joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact would help reduce the burden of military spending" and enable Pakistan "to put more money into economic construction"; but "in fact, military spending has been constantly increasing," and much of the foreign aid "promised for economic construction" has not yet been兑现.
    Although parties such as the Pakistan People's League and the Muslim League have not put forward more complete proposals in this regard, many of their leaders also spoke in parliament during the parliamentary debate on the fiscal budget in March this year, demanding "getting rid of dependence on American aid," "expanding trade with communist countries," "reducing military and administrative expenditures," and "reforming" the land system, etc.
    Pakistani business people are more sensitive to the impact of the American economic crisis. They have successively requested the government to "adjust" its foreign policy and take effective measures to "minimize the impact of the Western economic recession on Pakistan." Among them, more and more people believe that "the way out of the current situation is to maximize the expansion of trade relations with all countries and abandon the policy of national militarization."
    It is worth noting that more and more Pakistani newspapers have been openly discussing "what are the benefits of joining military blocs?" Moreover, many newspapers that actively supported the government's foreign policy in the past have now come to a negative conclusion on this issue. "The Pakistan Observer" wrote, "It is becoming clearer day by day that the regional treaties we have joined are of no benefit. These treaties only serve the interests of great powers, and this is now clearer than ever." "The Dawn" wrote that American "aid" cannot compensate for "the sacrifices Pakistan has made for American interests."
    According to the materials successively disclosed by Pakistani newspapers since the National Assembly of Pakistan discussed the fiscal budget in March this year, the Pakistani government still places its main hope on American "aid" in solving the problems of fiscal deficits, food shortages, and sources of construction funds. However, years of experience have led Pakistani domestic public opinion to the conclusion that American "aid" is "more harmful than beneficial." Although Pakistan receives American "aid" every year, its financial and economic situation has not improved, but has deteriorated. The calls against relying on American "aid" and demanding self-reliance have increased in the last year or two.
    In order to obtain American "aid," the Pakistani Minister of Finance visited the United States again in May this year. Foreign news reports that he requested the US government to lend Pakistan 180 million US dollars, but the United States only agreed to lend 15.5 million US dollars first. Pakistan's "Achievement News" published an editorial on this, saying, "Currently, Pakistanis generally complain that due to reliance on the West, we have been chained by military treaties; but facts have proven that the Soviet Union is more consistent in word and deed in terms of friendship than the United States and Britain." Indeed, this is a question worth pondering by Pakistan.

    巴基斯坦的经济情况
    铎生
    根据巴基斯坦报纸所披露的材料来看，这个年青的共和国当前的财政经济情况的确是十分困难的。特别是最近半年来，在美国经济危机加深的影响下，巴基斯坦经济更进一步地恶化了。
    几年来存在的主要问题
    近几年来，巴基斯坦经济的主要问题是：财政赤字庞大，通货膨胀，缺粮严重，物价上涨和广大劳动人民生活贫困。
    自1954年巴基斯坦政府签订美巴军事条约和参加马尼拉条约、巴格达条约等军事集团以来，它的军费开支与年俱增。根据巴基斯坦官方数字，在巴基斯坦中央政府的“国库预算”中，1954至1955年度军费占六亿三千九百万卢比，1955至1956年占七亿六千九百万，1956至1957年占七亿九千万，1957至1958年增至七亿九千三百万，1958至1959年进一步增至八亿八百万卢比（加上“资本预算”中已公开的“国防建设”费用则今年军费开支达十亿卢比以上）。军费在“国库预算”中所占的百分比亦由1954至1955年度的56％上升到最近几年的59％左右。庞大的军费开支，加上数以亿计的行政费等非生产开支，所造成的恶果之一就是巨额的财政赤字，据巴基斯坦报纸消息，在1958至1959年财政预算总收入的三十三亿卢比中，约有22.5％靠外援（包括外债）、27％靠各种形式的内债解决。这意味着新预算的实际赤字占其总收入的49％左右。
    为了弥补财政赤字，除靠外援和内债以外，巴基斯坦政府还不断增发通货。最近三、四年来，每年约增发通货三亿卢比（或稍少一点），但去年增发了四亿五千四百万卢比，超过以往的任何一年。这里值得指出的是，自1947年到1957年年底，通货增长约二倍，但同一时期巴基斯坦的国民经济总收入仅增长了7％左右。
    巴基斯坦是一个农业国，农村人口占全国人口的90％，农业产值约占国民经济总收入的90％，但是封建的生产关系严重地阻碍着农业生产力的发展。加上过去几届政府执行扩军政策，在经济上，特别是在防洪和水利灌溉等方面建树不多，近几年又接连发生水、旱灾，因此从1953年以来，巴基斯坦几乎每年都需要进口大量粮食。仅在1956和1957两年中，它便进口了二百万吨粮食，用去了它本国的外汇、黄金储备四亿五千万卢比，同时还用去了六亿五千万卢比的外援。
    由于物资供应不足和通货膨胀，加上缺粮问题的刺激以及囤积走私等等人为因素，巴基斯坦日用必需品的价格1957年较1956年上涨了60％左右。今年巴基斯坦中央政府宣布增加税收后，几天之内物价又上涨了20％。据巴基斯坦报纸报道，1947至1957年底，物价平均上涨了三倍（粮食的市价约涨四倍），但同一时期巴基斯坦广大职工的工资仅增加了20％左右。因此，巴基斯坦半官方报纸也承认，物价的不断上涨，严重影响了老百姓的生活，“已使巴基斯坦人民愈来愈贫困”并且促使罢工事件增加和“社会秩序的动荡”。
    美国经济危机的影响
    正当巴基斯坦的财政经济问题日趋困难的时候，美国发生了经济危机。巴基斯坦不少高级官员和工商界人士最近一再指出，美国的经济危机“给巴基斯坦带来了新的困难”，首先是“严重地打击了巴基斯坦的对外贸易”。
    在巴基斯坦的国民经济中，对外贸易占有很重要的地位。对外贸易收入占巴基斯坦国民经济总收入的10％左右。而且巴基斯坦政府的“国库预算”每年的收入约有三分之一以上依靠关税。对外贸易萎缩、关税收入相应减少时，经常会酿成财政赤字。巴基斯坦主要依靠出口棉花、黄麻等农业经济作物赚取外汇，换回它所需的机器（包括零件的补充）、多种工业原料、工业燃料和许多项轻工业产品。在出口贸易发生困难时，巴基斯坦政府为了减少国际收支的逆差，经常采取限制进口的措施。但其后果之一就是使物资缺乏的现象加剧，从而刺激物价上涨并引起本国工业企业开工不足和停工。
    因此，巴基斯坦的工商界人士和许多报纸都认为目前美国经济危机对巴基斯坦对外贸易的打击是一个十分严重的问题。他们特别表示反感的是这样一个事实：美国为了输出经济危机，“正在以极大的竞争性价格”倾销美棉和其他“剩余”物资，并且“以向外国提供津贴、援助和贷款等手段来资助购买美国商品的国家”，“而不考虑这些办法给其他依靠贸易的国家带来了何等严重的损害”。
    根据巴基斯坦报纸消息，美国经济危机已经给巴基斯坦带来了以下的影响：（1）在美国采取了提供津贴，倾销“剩余”物资的手段后，“一向购买巴基斯坦棉花的国家，如法国、日本、西德和英国都大大减少了购买巴棉的数量”，致使巴基斯坦棉花到今年5月份仍有四十万包“等待出口”，但无人问津。（2）原计划出口的黄麻（到5月份）尚有一百余万包未能觅得顾主。
  （3）今年1月份的出口贸易额较去年同一时期减少26％，今年2月份又较1月份减少37％，其中茶叶出口较今年1月减少80％，皮革等减少72％，棉布减少70％。（4）由于市场问题和竞争的影响，巴基斯坦出口商品价格不断下跌，例如羊毛价格已下降了50％左右，茶叶下降了20％，棉花下降了10％—20％。过去，巴基斯坦向美国出口的羊毛约占巴基斯坦全年羊毛产量的55％（向英国出口的羊毛又占27％）。但鉴于美英今年大大削减了购买巴基斯坦羊毛的数量，巴基斯坦的羊毛商协会4月份向政府提出了一项备忘录，指出：去年羊毛出口赚得了一亿卢比的外汇，今年可能减少到四千万卢比以下。巴基斯坦茶叶出口商会不久前也估计今年茶叶出口所能赚得的外汇，可能较去年减少50％。
    巴基斯坦的“今天报”最近在一篇评论中回顾了近几个月的情况后写道，最近一个时期的事实证明，由于美国的经济危机和随之而来的其他西方国家的经济衰退，“已经使巴基斯坦的经济陷入极为窘迫的境地”。
    各党派和舆论的要求
    面对着上述形势，巴基斯坦各党派、各阶层都认为“必须从目前的经济困难里摆脱出来”。他们都在不同程度上要求政府改变其内外政策。民族人民党主张：对外应该退出一切军事条约，“从美援的统治下解放出来”，执行和平中立的独立外交政策，和东、西方国家在同样的条件下发展贸易，并且争取从双方取得无条件的援助；对内应该大量裁减军费开支、集中力量进行经济建设，废除地主的土地所有制，并且采取有效措施改善广大人民的生活。民族人民党主席巴沙尼5月15日向记者发表谈话时指出，过去几届政府“曾向我们保证说，与西方国家结成联盟并参加东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约后，有助于减轻军费负担”，并使巴基斯坦“可以把更多的钱用于经济建设”；但“事实上军费开支却在不断增加”，外援“答应用于经济建设的款项”还有很多未兑现。
    巴基斯坦的人民联盟、穆斯林联盟等政党在这方面虽然没有提出比较完整的主张，但在今年3月国会辩论财政预算时，它们的许多领导人物也在国会发言要求“摆脱对美援的依赖”、“扩大和共产党国家的贸易”、“削减军费和行政开支”、“改良”土地制度等。
    巴基斯坦工商界人士对美国经济危机的打击是比较敏感的。他们纷纷要求政府“调整”对外政策，采取有效措施去“尽量减轻西方国家经济衰退对巴基斯坦的打击”，在他们当中，愈来愈多的人认为“目前局势的出路就是最大限度地扩大同一切国家的贸易关系并且放弃国家军事化的政策”。
    值得注意的是，愈来愈多的巴基斯坦报纸已在公开议论“参加军事集团究竟有何好处？”而且，不少在过去积极支持政府外交政策的报纸，目前在这个问题上作出了否定的结论。“巴基斯坦前哨报”写道，“一天比一天明显，我们所参加的地区性条约没有什么好处。这些条约只替大国的利益服务，这一点现在已经是再明显不过的了”。“晨报”写道，美“援”不能补偿“巴基斯坦为了美国利益而作出的那种牺牲”。
    根据巴基斯坦国民议会今年3月讨论财政预算以来巴基斯坦报纸所陆续披露的材料来看，巴基斯坦政府在解决财政赤字、缺粮问题和建设资金的来源等问题上，仍然把主要希望寄托在美“援”上。但是几年来的经历已使巴基斯坦国内舆论得出这样一个结论：美“援”是“利少害多”，巴基斯坦虽然每年都在接受美“援”，但财政经济情况不但没有好转，反而日趋恶化。反对依赖美“援”和要求自力更生的呼声，最近一、二年来有了增长。
    今年5月巴基斯坦的财政部长为了取得美“援”，曾再次访问了美国。外电报道，他要求美国政府贷给巴基斯坦一亿八千万美元，但美国仅答应先贷给一千五百五十万美元。巴基斯坦的“成就报”为此发表社论说，“目前巴基斯坦人普遍埋怨，由于依赖西方，我们被套上了军事条约的锁链；但事实证明，苏联在友谊方面，比美英更言行一致”。的确，这是值得巴基斯坦深思的一个问题。
