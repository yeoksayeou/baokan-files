　　Little poplar tree, little poplar tree, a foot long, plant it beside the highway. You plant willows, I plant poplars, as long as the highway, plant as long as it is. A row of willows, a row of poplars, growing taller year after year. Riding in a car, looking at willows and poplars, willow trees and poplar trees shade the sun. Don't thank the willows, don't thank the poplars, a thousand thanks, ten thousand thanks to the Communist Party, a good proposition for greening the whole country.

    小杨树小杨树，尺把长，把它栽到公路旁。你栽柳，我栽杨，公路多长栽多长。一行柳，一行杨，一年一年往上长。坐汽车，看柳杨，柳树杨树遮太阳，别谢柳，别谢杨，千谢万谢共产党，绿化全国好主张。
                （安徽）
