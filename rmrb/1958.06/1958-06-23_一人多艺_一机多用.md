One person waiting for work, work waiting for people – this phenomenon hindering production exists in old factories, and also in new factories, in production departments, and also in construction units. In the past, it was generally believed that this was a problem of planning and scheduling. Now, more and more facts prove that although this phenomenon is related to planning and scheduling, it is not entirely, or even mainly, a planning and scheduling problem. An important reason is: the multiple talents of production personnel have not been brought into play, and the multiple capabilities of machinery and equipment have not been utilized.

If everyone learns to be a versatile worker, or is called a person with multiple skills, and machines can do a variety of jobs, or are called one machine with multiple uses, this problem can be solved. Not only can the tense situation in production be resolved, but also the situation of work stoppages waiting for materials, or materials being ready but personnel not, can be improved. There will be a greater certainty of achieving the leap forward targets.

To require a person to specialize in one field, be proficient in three, and understand five, is not something that can be achieved simply by saying it. In addition to the individual's dedication to research, it is very important for leaders to provide planned guidance. The Qinghai Provincial Petroleum Exploration Bureau has actively formulated a system for training versatile workers, which is to help employees quickly master multiple technologies. This is a good method and is worth introducing to other regions.

    一人多艺  一机多用
    人等工作，工作等人，这种阻碍生产的现象，老厂有，新厂也有，生产部门有，建设单位也有。过去，总认为这是计划调度方面的问题，现在，越来越多的事实证明：这种现象固然和计划调度有关，但也不全是甚至主要不是计划调度问题。一个重要原因是：没有发挥生产人员的多种才能，没有发挥机器设备的多种效能。
    人人学会多面手，或者叫做一人多艺，机器能干多种活，或者叫做一机多用，就能解决这个问题。不仅生产上紧张局面可以解决，而且停工待料、料齐人不齐的情况，也就有可能得到改善。实现跃进指标把握就会更大。
    要一个人专一门、会三门、懂五门，并不是一件说到就可以做到的事情。除了本人的钻研精神外，领导上有计划地加以指导这是很重要的。青海省石油勘探局积极制定培训多面手的制度，就是帮助职工尽快地掌握多种技术。这是个好办法，值得向各地介绍。
