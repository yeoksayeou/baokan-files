    At Jiayuguan
    The ancient Jiayuguan—the westernmost point of the Great Wall—has also undergone tremendous changes in this era of the Great Leap Forward. Surveying teams searching for treasures for the motherland, after surveying the treasures under the Qilian Mountains and the Jingtieshan Mountains, planted red flags on and around the Jiayuguan Fortress and set up drilling rigs. The beacon towers on the Great Wall have become good places to set up surveying station markers. Tents were erected in the vast Gobi Desert, and drilling rigs were set up.

    在嘉峪关
    古老的嘉峪关——万里长城的最西点，在这个跃进的时代里，也发生了巨大的变化。为祖国找宝的勘测队员们，勘察了祁连山和镜铁山地下的宝藏以后，又在嘉峪关城堡上下插上了红旗，架起钻机。长城上的烽火台成了架设勘测站标的好地方。在大戈壁滩上搭起帐篷，架起钻机。　　　　新华社记者　李基禄摄
