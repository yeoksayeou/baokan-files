　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 1st. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the northern Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang are bravely confronting the sudden attack of summer gales, snowstorms, and frost, the likes of which have not been seen in decades.

　　Starting May 29th, northern Xinjiang was fiercely attacked by cold air currents from the Arctic, causing temperatures to plummet. Urumqi, Qitai, Changji, and the Manas River basin reclamation area all experienced snowfall. According to Urumqi meteorological history records, this is the latest snowfall in the Urumqi area since 1906 (no records exist prior to that). At the same time, areas such as Yining, Altay, and the Bukesair Mongol Autonomous County experienced gale-force winds of around level ten. Frost also occurred in the northern Tianshan region.

　　On May 30th, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed local Party committees to take immediate action, with Party secretaries taking the lead in mobilizing the masses to protect crops and livestock in the fight against the disaster. Now, farmers and herdsmen in various regions have been urgently mobilized to launch a tenacious struggle against wind, snow, and frost. On the morning of the 30th, before the heavy snow stopped, five or six thousand farmers of all ethnic groups in the suburbs of Urumqi, led by Guo Xuewen, the district Party secretary, went to the fields to rescue crops. Several thousand mu of vegetables in various agricultural cooperatives were covered with wheat straw and reed mats to shield them from frost and cold. The farmers moved hundreds of thousands of tender seedlings, one by one, from the snowy ground into houses, to be moved back out after the weather cleared. Tens of thousands of soldiers in various military reclamation farms in the Manas reclamation area, in order to protect cotton, lit bonfires around the cotton fields before the frost, increasing the air temperature above the cotton fields to prevent frost damage. Herdsmen in the Altay Mountains are vacating large numbers of yurts to house newly shorn sheep and young livestock, to prevent them from freezing to death.

　　新疆天山北部农牧民
    迎战夏季大风霜
    新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　新疆天山北部地区各族农牧民正以大无畏的英雄气概，迎战几十年未有过的夏季大风雪和霜冻的突袭。
    新疆北部地区从5月29日开始，受到从北极吹来的冷气流的猛烈侵袭，气温急剧下降，乌鲁木齐、奇台、昌吉和玛纳斯河流域垦区都下了雪。据乌鲁木齐气象历史记载，这是乌鲁木齐地区从1906年（以前无记载）以来降雪时间最迟的一次大雪。同时，伊宁、阿勒泰和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县等地还刮了十级左右的大风。天山北部地区还发生霜冻。
    5月30日，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会指示各地党委立即行动，党委书记挂帅，动员广大群众，保护农作物和牲畜的抗灾斗争。现在，各地农牧民已经紧急动员起来，向风雪和霜冻展开顽强斗争。30日早晨大雪未停，乌鲁木齐市郊区五、六千名各族农民就在区委书记郭学文的带领下，到地里抢救庄稼，各农业社几千亩蔬菜都用麦草、苇箔复盖起来，挡霜抗寒。农民们把几十万株嫩弱菜苗一株一株从雪地里移到屋子里，待天晴后再移出来。玛纳斯垦区各军垦农场几万名战士，为了保卫棉花，在霜降之前，在棉田周围燃起篝火，增加棉田上空气温，预防霜冻。阿勒泰山区的牧民们正腾出大批人住帐篷，让刚剪了毛的羊群和幼畜住到里面，以免冻死牲畜。
