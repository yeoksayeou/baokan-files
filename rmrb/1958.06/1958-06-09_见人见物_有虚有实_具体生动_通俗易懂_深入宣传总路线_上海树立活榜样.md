Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. Shanghai mobilized 500,000 propaganda personnel today, using various forms to vigorously publicize the general line of socialist construction. Many people and events with the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and accomplish have become living examples for the whole people to implement the general line and liberate their minds through propaganda.

　　Today, hundreds of propaganda stations were set up on the main streets of the city. Thousands of workers, students, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and all kinds of artistic groups were performing their newly compiled programs. Many of these programs were based on real people and events in the implementation of the general line. The story of Li Shiying, an old worker with only elementary school education, who created an electro-spark drilling machine and broke the superstitions and mysteries of science, was one of the most popular programs in street performances. Writers wrote a large number of "poetry leaflets" and printed more than 100,000 copies to be posted on streets and alleys. Propaganda teams from a large number of factories took to the streets with new products they had created with full energy. The newly trial-produced universal tractor was also driven out. The tractor attracted a large number of people wherever it went, and they listened excitedly to the workers' ballads and explanations. The workers said: "As long as we resolutely implement the general line, things that we dared not think or do in the past can be completely achieved. This tractor was made by more than a dozen small factories working closely together in sixteen days." The staff of the Runhua Dye Factory, which surpassed the United Kingdom in manufacturing reactive dyes and jumped to the world's first place, brought samples of reactive dyes and silk floral fabrics dyed with them. In Hongkou Park and many neighborhoods, they publicized the process of making this dye, which the United Kingdom had only invented two years ago, and explained that the production varieties had surpassed the United Kingdom, so that the masses could specifically understand that as long as they resolutely implement the general line, break superstitions, dare to speak, and dare to act, surpassing the United Kingdom is not difficult.

　　The activities of publicizing the general line in factories are even more enthusiastic. Many factories have held exhibitions to publicize the general line, using various real people and events and objects to carry out propaganda. The workers have written tens of thousands of singing materials to publicize the achievements of advanced figures and major inventions in stations, clubs, and workers' residential areas. Many factories immediately compiled singing programs to publicize any creations, so that everyone could quickly see the achievements of implementing the general line. The first fast drying machine in China, trial-produced by the staff of the Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory yesterday, and the foundry workshop built with waste materials in a few days, which only cast the first furnace of molten iron yesterday, have become the content of today's propaganda. The propaganda of the general line has become a huge force to promote technological innovation in this factory. Zhao Gengxin, the deputy director of the factory, after hearing the report of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, decided to change the work of engraving printing rollers from manual to automatic. Now he has started to trial-produce the first electronic engraving machine. Chen Jichao, a worker-born duty director of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, who created the "flat steel reverse enclosing plate" a week ago, also participated in the general line propaganda team today. He took the model of the "flat steel reverse enclosing plate" to many steel plants to introduce how he worked hard, strived for the best, and created this new, faster, better, and more economical equipment in the steel rolling industry. He said that in the past, the reverse enclosing plate invented by Zhang Mingshan, a famous model worker of Anshan Iron and Steel, could only be used to roll round steel and rebar, but not flat steel. He had wanted to create it for a long time, but because his cultural level was not high, he dared not do it. Moreover, the factory had spent 10,000 yuan to test this reverse enclosing plate two years ago, but it was not successful. Later, the workers also made several suggestions, but the technicians always thought that it was unthinkable to study the reverse enclosing plate for rolling flat steel. After the launch of the technological innovation movement, Chen Jichao decided to try boldly, and he was supported and cooperated by the leaders and the masses of workers. After five days of hard work, he finally succeeded in the trial production on June 1. The workers changed from manual operation to automatic operation, and the output increased by about 20%. Chen Jichao's personal propaganda of the spirit of the general line gave great inspiration to many experienced steel rolling technicians and workers. The staff of the Shanghai No. 7 Steel Plant and the Xinhu Steel Plant are determined to learn Chen Jichao's spirit of daring to act, not being afraid of difficulties, and increasing production faster.

　　Scientists and professors also participated in the propaganda of the general line. The Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association used many instruments and objects in the Daxin Amusement Park and Huangpu Park to explain to the masses the principles of advanced science and technology such as jet engines, power supplyless radios, thermistors, and selenium photocells, explaining that as long as they go all out and aim high, everyone can master science and technology, which is not out of reach. Professors and teachers from the Foreign Languages Department of Fudan University performed a living newspaper in People's Park, publicizing the fact that the carpenter Xu Agui made the "Leap Forward" rotary sieve. Many professors in the Chemistry Department who had studied in the United Kingdom and the United States also sang a chorus of "Breaking Superstition Song": "Breaking superstition and catching up with the UK, we are not afraid of foreigners. Foreigners are people, and so are we..."

　　Extensive propaganda was also launched in the neighborhoods. Eighteen elderly women over sixty years old on Changping Road who are working hard to learn culture formed a propaganda team today to go to eleven neighborhood committees to explain the content of the general line in plain language by comparing the old and new societies, and use their experience of learning culture in their old age to encourage everyone to go all out and aim high, get rid of illiteracy as soon as possible, and build socialism better.

    见人见物　有虚有实　具体生动　通俗易懂
    深入宣传总路线　上海树立活榜样
    本报上海8日电　上海今天出动五十万宣传大军，用各种形式大张旗鼓宣传社会主义建设总路线。许许多多具有敢想敢说敢做敢为共产主义风格的人物和事迹，通过宣传成为全民贯彻总路线、思想大解放的活榜样。
    今天，全市的主要街道设了几百个宣传站，成千上万工人、学生、解放军和所有文艺团体都在这里演出他们新编的节目，其中不少是根据贯彻总路线中的真人真事编写的。只有小学文化水平的老工人李士英创造电火花钻孔机，打破了科学神秘迷信等事迹，都是街头演出中最受欢迎的节目，作家们写了大量的“诗传单”，印了十多万份分贴到大街小巷。大批工厂的宣传队伍带着他们鼓足干劲创造出来的新产品上街宣传。不久前试制成功的万能拖拉机也开出来了。拖拉机所到之处吸引了大批群众，他们兴奋地听着工人们的说唱和解释。工人们说：“只要坚决贯彻总路线，以往不敢想、不敢做的事情也完全可以做到；这台拖拉机便是十多家小厂紧密协作，在十六天中制成的。”以制造活性染料超过英国跃居世界第一的润华染料厂的职工宣传队，今天带了活性染料的样品和染出的丝绸花布，在虹口公园和许多里弄内，宣传制成这种英国在两年前才发明的染料的经过，而且说明生产的品种已经超过英国，使群众具体地理解到只要坚决贯彻总路线，打破迷信，敢说，敢为，超过英国并不是难事。
    工厂里宣传总路线的活动更是热火朝天。许多厂都举办了宣传总路线展览会，用各种真人真事和实物来进行宣传。职工们编写了数以万计的演唱材料，在车站、俱乐部以及工人住宅区中宣传先进人物和重大创造发明的成就。许多工厂都是一有创造，马上编成演唱节目进行宣传，使大家迅速看到贯彻总路线的成就。上海第二印染厂职工昨天试制成的国内第一台快速烘燥机，昨天才铸出第一炉铁水的、在几天时间内用废旧料建成的铸工车间，都成了今天的宣传内容。总路线的宣传在这个厂里已经成为推动技术革新的巨大力量。这个厂的副厂长赵庚辛听了“八大”二次会议的传达后，决心把雕刻印花滚筒的工作由手工变为自动化，现在已经动手试制第一台电传雕刻机。一星期前创制成“扁钢反围盘”的上钢三厂工人出身的值班主任陈纪潮，今天也参加了总路线宣传队。他带着“扁钢反围盘”的模型，到许多钢铁厂去介绍他怎样鼓足干劲，力争上游，创造这种轧钢工业上多快好省的新设备。他说，过去鞍钢著名劳模张明山发明的反围盘只能用来轧圆钢和螺纹钢，不能轧扁钢。他早就想创造，但因自己文化水平不高，不敢动手，而且厂里前两年也花过一万元试验这种反围盘，没有成功。后来工人们也提过几次建议，可是技术人员始终认为研究轧扁钢的反围盘想也不要想。技术革新运动开展后，陈纪潮决心大胆尝试，并且得到了领导和工人群众的支持和配合，经过五天的苦钻苦研，终于在6月1日试制成功了。工人由手工操作变为自动操作，产量提高20％左右。陈纪潮现身说法的宣传总路线的精神，给许多有经验的轧钢技师和工人很大启示。上钢七厂、新沪钢铁厂的职工都决心学习陈纪潮敢作敢为，不怕困难的精神，更快地提高产量。
    科学家和教授们也参加了总路线的宣传。上海市科学技术普及协会在大新游乐场和黄浦公园，用许多仪器和实物向群众解释喷气式发动机、无电源收音机、热敏电阻、硒光电池等先进科学技术的原理，说明只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，科学技术人人均能掌握，并非高不可攀。复旦大学外文系的教授和教师们在人民公园内表演了活报剧，宣传木匠徐阿桂制成“跃进式”转动机筛。化学系许多曾经留学英美的教授，还合唱了“破除迷信歌”：“破除迷信赶英国，我们不怕洋人。洋人是人，我们也是人……。”
    里弄中也展开了广泛的宣传。昌平路正在努力学文化的十八位六十多岁的老妈妈，今天组成了宣传队到十一个居民委员会，用新旧社会对比，通俗地讲解总路线的内容，并用自己老年学文化的体会，鼓励大家鼓足干劲，力争上游，早日摘掉文盲帽子，更好地建设社会主义。（附图片）
