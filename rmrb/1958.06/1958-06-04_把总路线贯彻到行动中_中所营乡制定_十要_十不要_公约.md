Carry Out the General Line in Action
Zhongsuoying Township Formulates "Ten Musts" and "Ten Must Nots" Covenant

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Party organization of Zhongsuoying Township in Xushui County, Hebei Province, used the facts of the production and life of the peasant masses to conduct propaganda and education on the general line of socialist construction to the peasants, and rapidly changed the ideological and productive outlook of the entire township.

    A part of the peasants in Zhongsuoying Township, due to a lack of comprehensive and systematic understanding of the general line, had negative emotions of weariness and fear when faced with drought and tight and arduous farm work. Some people believed that investing in canals and wells time and again, the movement seemed like the "golden hoop curse", tightening more and more. Some people, seeing that there was a lot of farm work and little labor, were greedy for quantity and speed when working, neglecting quality. These one-sided understandings and erroneous ideas contradicted the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, affecting the in-depth development of the production movement.

    In view of the above situation, starting in late April, the Party organization of Zhongsuoying Township, in addition to continuing to explain the content and significance of the general line to the peasants in a popular and systematic way, focused on summarizing representative examples of the production and life of the peasant masses, mobilizing the peasants to discuss, and helping the peasants deepen their understanding of the general line. During spring plowing, sowing, and wheat field management, a production team leader in the "Five-Five" Cooperative only wanted to save labor. After the wheat had jointed, he actually let the commune members use a harrow instead of hoeing to cultivate the wheat fields, causing some damage to the wheat seedlings. The Party organization of Zhongsuoying Township seized this example of only seeking speed and disregarding quality and conducted a special discussion on greater, faster, better, and more economical results among the commune members of the entire township. During the discussion, some people said that fast work leads to rough work, and if you want speed, you cannot guarantee quality. Most people advocated that labor is not only for completing tasks, but mainly for producing more grain, so speed and quality must be combined.

    After several discussions and studies combining examples, the peasants gradually realized the great significance of the general line to their personal lives and urgently demanded to use the spirit of the general line to guide their actions. Based on this, the Party organization of Zhongsuoying Township, according to the main content of the general line and the ideological situation of the peasants in the township, formulated a covenant for socialist construction. The main spirit of this covenant is: Must pursue greater, faster, better, and more economical results; do not pursue lesser, slower, worse, and more wasteful results; must be full of energy; do not be discouraged and relax; must leap forward; do not proceed gradually; must be pragmatic; do not shout empty slogans; must abide by labor discipline; do not be absent from work or delay work; must ensure quality; do not cut corners or be careless; must follow the mass line; do not give compulsory orders; must support each other; do not be selfish and localistic; must pursue socialism; do not pursue capitalism; must listen to the Party; do not disobey the leadership of the Party.

    After a relatively specific and in-depth publicity of the general line in this township, the thinking of the masses has undergone great changes. The atmosphere of striving to be advanced and catching up with the advanced has been formed. In just over half a month, more than 500 activists have emerged in the township.

### 把总路线贯彻到行动中  中所营乡制定“十要”“十不要”公约

　　把总路线贯彻到行动中
    中所营乡制定“十要”“十不要”公约
    本报讯  中共河北省徐水县中所营乡党组织利用农民群众生产生活事实，向农民进行社会主义建设总路线的宣传教育，迅速改变了全乡的思想，生产面貌。
    中所营乡有一部分农民，由于对总路线缺乏全面系统的认识，在遇到旱灾农活紧张艰巨的时候，曾发生过厌倦畏惧的消极情绪。有些人认为，开了渠又打机井，投资一次又一次，运动好像“金箍咒”，越勒越紧。有些人见农活多劳力少，干活时便贪多求快，忽视质量。这些片面认识和错误思想，和多快好省的建设总路线相抵触，影响着生产运动的深入开展。
    根据上述情况，中共中所营乡党组织从4月下旬开始，除继续向农民通俗系统的讲解总路线的内容意义外，着重总结农民群众生产生活中有代表性的事例，发动农民进行讨论，帮助农民加深对总路线的理解。在春耕播种和管理麦田时，“五五”一社一个生产队长只图省工，在小麦拔节后竟让社员用耙代替人锄中耕麦田，使麦苗受到一定损失。中共中所营乡党组织就抓住这个只求快不顾好的事例，在全乡社员当中进行了一次多快好省的专题讨论。讨论时，有人说快工出粗活，要快就不能保证质量。多数人则主张，劳动不是只为完成任务，主要还是为多打粮食，因此必须快好结合。
    经过几次结合实例的讨论学习，农民逐渐认识到总路线对个人生活的巨大意义，迫切要求用总路线的精神来指导自己的行动。据此，中所营乡党组织又根据总路线主要内容和本乡农民的思想情况，制订出一个社会主义建设公约。这个公约的主要精神是：要多快好省，不要少慢差费；要鼓足干劲，不要泄劲松气；要跃进，不要渐进；要实干，不要空喊；要遵守劳动纪律，不要缺勤误工；要保证质量，不要偷工粗糙；要群众路线，不要强迫命令；要互相支援，不要自私本位；要社会主义，不要资本主义；要听党的话，不要不听信党的领导。
    这个乡经过比较具体深入的总路线宣传，群众的思想已有很大转变。争先进、赶先进已形成风气。半个多月的时间，全乡即涌现出五百多名积极分子。
