　　Taiyuan兴建Seamless Steel Tube Plant

　　Another large-scale seamless steel tube plant in our country has recently commenced construction in Taiyuan.

　　This seamless steel tube plant, with an annual output of 100,000 tons of various caliber pipes, is expected to be put into production by January next year.

　　This plant is an integral part of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The entire design is undertaken by the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the complete set of production equipment will be manufactured by the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant.

　　After this plant is put into production, it can use locally sourced materials, directly utilizing the steel and rolled billet equipment of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant for production, thus greatly reducing product costs.

　　太原兴建无缝钢管厂
    我国又一座大型无缝钢管厂最近在太原动工兴建。
    这座年产各种口径管材十万吨的无缝钢管厂，预计到明年1月即可以投入生产。
    这个厂是太原钢铁厂的一个组成部分，全部设计是由冶金工业部黑色冶金设计总院担负的，全套生产设备将由太原重型机器厂制造。
    这个厂投入生产以后，可以就地取材，直接利用太原钢铁厂的钢材和轧坯设备进行生产，因而，产品成本可以大大降低。
