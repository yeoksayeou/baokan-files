Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: All provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country will build two hundred medium and small-sized steelmaking converters within the next year, with a total annual production capacity of ten million tons. The charging capacity of these converters ranges from 0.5 tons to 12 tons. This decision was made at the recent National Local Metallurgical Conference held in Beijing.

Following the large-scale development of local iron and steel industries, the establishment of these medium and small-sized converters nationwide is a pioneering undertaking in China's local metallurgical industry. Complete sets of equipment for medium and small-sized steelmaking converters are being designed and manufactured domestically.

After these medium and small-sized converters are built and put into production, they will not only rapidly increase the steel production of local metallurgical industries, strongly support the development of local machinery manufacturing industries, but more importantly, they will cultivate a large number of technicians who can operate converters, providing technical conditions for the greater development of local steelmaking industries in the future.

Converter slag, after being crushed, can become a fertilizer with similar effectiveness to superphosphate. Therefore, the large-scale development of medium and small-sized steelmaking converters also provides a large amount of fertilizer for rural areas, and the cost of steelmaking is correspondingly reduced.

Shandong, Jiangsu, Hebei, Anhui, Henan, and Sichuan provinces will each build ten to fifteen medium and small-sized converters with charging capacities of 0.5 to 12 tons. Some newly built medium and small-sized converters in Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Beijing, and other places have already been put into production. Other provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are constructing or planning to construct medium and small-sized converters.

Due to the commissioning of some newly built medium and small-sized converters, the steel production of local metallurgical industries this year will reach more than one million tons, which is three to four times the steel production of local metallurgical industries last year.

A large number of technicians and skilled workers required for local converter steelmaking are being trained in the original converter steel plants across the country. In order to support the establishment of steelmaking industries in various localities, the original converter steel plants have also sent some veteran technicians and technical personnel to help provinces, cities, and autonomous regions build converters and begin production.

    一年内建成二百座中小型转炉
    钢产量将猛增一千万吨
    新华社18日讯　全国各省、市、自治区将在今后一年内建成年产总量达一千万吨的中小型炼钢转炉二百座，这批转炉的装炉量从○点五吨到十二吨。这是最近在北京召开的全国地方冶金会议上决定的。
    继大规模发展地方炼铁工业之后，在全国范围内建立这批中小型转炉是我国地方冶金工业的创举。中小型炼钢转炉的全套设备正由国内设计制造。
    这批中小型转炉建成投入生产后，不仅能迅速增加地方冶金工业的钢产量，有力地支援地方机器制造工业的发展，更重要的是将会培养出大批能操作转炉的技术力量，为将来地方炼钢工业更大发展提供技术条件。
    转炉炼钢的炉渣，破碎后可以成为与过磷酸钙的效用相仿的肥料。因此，大量发展中小型炼钢转炉，又为农村提供了大量的肥料，炼钢的成本也相应降低。
    山东、江苏、河北、安徽、河南和四川等省将各建十座到十五座装炉量为○点五到十二吨的中小型转炉。浙江、山西、山东和北京等地部分新建的中小型转炉已投入生产。其他各省、市、自治区正在建设或筹建中小型转炉。
    由于部分新建中小型转炉投入生产，今年地方冶金工业的钢产量将达一百万吨以上，为去年地方冶金工业钢产量的三至四倍。
    地方转炉炼钢所需大批技术工人、技术员正在全国各原有转炉钢厂训练中。为了支援地方兴建炼钢工业，原有的各转炉钢厂还派了一些老技术工人和技术人员帮助各省、市、自治区建设转炉和开工生产。
