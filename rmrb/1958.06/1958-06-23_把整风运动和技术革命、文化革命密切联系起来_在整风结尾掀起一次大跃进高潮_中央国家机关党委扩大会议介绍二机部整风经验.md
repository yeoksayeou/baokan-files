Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The Central State Organs Party Committee held its 24th Enlarged Party Committee Meeting on the 20th. At the meeting, the experience of the rectification movement in the Second Ministry of Machine Building was introduced. Finally, Comrade Xi Zhongxun spoke at the meeting, discussing the future arrangements for the rectification movement in the Central State Organs and several issues that should be noted.

The information and issues provided at this meeting touched on how to persevere in the rectification movement to the end, how to connect the rectification movement with the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and how to implement the spirit of the rectification into future daily work. These issues inspired various organs.

Empiricism is the most blindly practical. Only by continuously strengthening learning, breaking down superstitions, and liberating thinking can we get rid of empiricism.

The leaders of the Second Ministry of Machine Building first introduced the situation of their ministry studying and implementing the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, criticizing dogmatism and empiricism in the "On Vacuity" discussions. Because the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism were broken, superstitions were eliminated, and thinking was liberated, the wisdom and creativity of the masses were fully utilized. Recently, this ministry launched a vigorous leap forward climax to offer gifts to "July 1st." Launching such a climax at the end of the rectification movement naturally connected the rectification movement with the technological revolution and cultural revolution.

The Second Ministry of Machine Building has already conducted Red and Expert debates. At the beginning of "On Vacuity," they focused on criticizing dogmatism, and later further criticized empiricism. The ministry believes that empiricism is the main tendency in their current leadership work. The leadership backbone of the ministry is basically an empiricist "old guard." Because in the face of new things, the "old experience" of empiricism was exhausted, the result was to worship experts and worship foreigners, often becoming supporters and peddlers of dogmatism. Empiricism is relatively stubborn. If dogmatism has been discredited within the Party, then empiricism has not yet been discredited. People who suffer from this problem seem to be busy all day long, working hard and bearing hardships, which is easy for others to understand, and they themselves seem to be "clear of conscience." In fact, empiricism is detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from politics. Empiricism is the most unprincipled pragmatism, the most hopeless, and the most blindly practical.

The Second Ministry of Machine Building analyzed the main manifestations of empiricism in the rectification movement as: one low (low level of political theory, very poor learning); two lazy (ideological laziness, complacency); three airs (old airs, bureaucratic airs, arrogant airs are prominent manifestations of empiricism); and four none. The so-called four none are, first of all, "no radio in the brain," lacking clear guidelines and policies in work, manifesting as busy transactionalism, dealing with matters on a case-by-case basis, not good at using the Party's guidelines and policies to mobilize the masses, and then driving all work, not good at analyzing the situation and starting from the overall situation. As a result, they grasped the small and lost the big, only caring about picking "sesame seeds" busily, but not paying attention to holding the "big watermelon" in work. Because of "no radio in the brain," the leadership work has great blindness and lacks consciousness. Secondly, empiricism is manifested as "no one in sight," only seeing things and not seeing people, worshiping systems and orders, worshiping technology and experts, not believing in the masses, and not relying on the masses. As a result, although a large number of advanced figures and advanced experiences have emerged in the work of this ministry, the leadership has not discovered them. Because they do not believe in the masses, it is easy to create a slow, lethargic, and deserted situation in work. Third, "no number in the heart," not paying attention to investigation and research, not paying attention to dissecting "sparrows," not paying attention to summarizing experience. Although some work has been successfully done, the leadership is still without number in heart and lacks systematic experience. Fourth, "no roots under the feet," because the leadership work is detached from the masses and detached from reality, they cannot see the primary and secondary in work, cannot take root among the masses, and as a result, they lack confidence, cannot make up their minds, and are prone to wavering when encountering difficulties.

How to get rid of the shackles of empiricism? The Second Ministry of Machine Building believes that the only way out is to continuously strengthen learning, break down superstitions, and liberate thinking. The ministry proposed that in the future, they should strengthen theoretical study, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works, and at the same time go to the masses, learn from the masses, and learn from practice, requiring learning while doing and learning by doing. The method is to rely on consciousness and assistance. Now the Second Ministry of Machine Building has formulated some systems, such as leading cadres regularly going to the grassroots level, each leading cadre summarizing several experiences every year, dissecting several "sparrows" every year, and Party members talking about one or two new problems and new situations every day when they meet, etc., to supervise and guarantee through these systems.

After criticizing empiricism, the comrades of the Second Ministry of Machine Building were full of enthusiasm. They were determined to "everyone insert a red flag, every section has a gift, fight hard for three to five years, and catch up with England."

After criticizing empiricism, the leading cadres and the masses of the Second Ministry of Machine Building felt confident in their work, everyone was in a good mood, and they were full of enthusiasm. Recently, the ministry held a leap forward conference for all staff members, and then held a leap forward conference for all young people. The two conferences formed two conferences to compare leap forwards, compare enthusiasm, compare upstream, and compare ideological liberation. At the meeting, everyone offered suggestions and treasures, and immediately after the meeting, a heat wave of hard work and hard work was launched in the entire scope. In particular, the youth had the greatest enthusiasm and the most active performance. In order to manufacture new products to offer gifts to "July 1st," many people recently moved their bedding to the office and worked day and night. Many people did not rest at noon and worked overnight in the evening. Some units were busy in the office for twenty-four hours, with no distinction between day and night. In order to realize the leap forward plan, the young people did not calculate time by month or day, but by hour. They held Zhuge Liang meetings every two hours to exchange experiences and solve difficulties, and checked work results every day or three days.

According to the current situation, due to the enthusiasm of the masses, this ministry will have dozens of inspiring and weighty new achievements and new creations to offer gifts to "July 1st" this year. Many things that originally took ten to fifteen years to accomplish can now be done in three to five years, or even a few months. Some things that were unimaginable due to the low level of technology in our country now have the confidence to exceed the level of capitalist countries on "July 1st" or "October 1st" this year. At present, this ministry has successfully trial-produced five important technical creations ahead of schedule. These five technical creations have all reached or exceeded the international level. This kind of leap forward has dealt a blow to the "watching the tide" faction, and has profoundly educated all the so-called "conditional theory," "basic theory," "habit theory," and "grasp theory" people. People proposed, "Hard work produces clever work, busy work produces clever craftsmen." From practical and hard work, people's thinking has been further liberated. They said, "The more you do, the less you are afraid, the less you do, the more you are afraid, not afraid of failure, and come back again after failure." Some said: "At the beginning, there was no 'bottom' in my heart, and I had no confidence, but the 'bottom' was found from doing it, and there was nothing great about it." These fully reflect their spirit of learning while doing.

Not only engineering and technical personnel are full of enthusiasm, but all units of this ministry are like a whole, jointly involved in the leap forward wave. The supply units proposed: "What is needed, supply what, when is it needed, when is it supplied." Translators proposed: "Russian is taught and learned, and is available on call." The library implemented the regulations of "borrowing books by phone, delivering them to the door, and opening the library for twenty-four hours a day." Medical staff took the initiative to go to the departments to work and ensure the health of the staff. Even the cooks were mobilized, and they guaranteed "food within twenty-four hours, and hot soup and noodles delivered to the office." This vivid situation fully demonstrates the high degree of communist consciousness of all personnel and the strengthening of the spirit of unity and cooperation.

Launching a climax of the Great Leap Forward at the end of the rectification movement is a major review of the rectification movement. The person in charge of the Second Ministry of Machine Building said that in order to prevent the restoration of normalcy after the rectification and the restoration of the old habit of "handling official affairs" as before the rectification, they are prepared to retain the revolutionary spirit brought about by the rectification movement, the set of working methods and organizational forms (such as the rectification office) of leading the rectification movement, and apply them to daily work, using the method of mass movement to lead the regular work of the organs. They affirmed the form of the leap forward conference, and according to the requirements of the masses, they are prepared to hold leap forward gift-giving conferences every year on "May 1st," "July 1st," "October 1st," "New Year's Day," and "March 8th" (proposed by women cadres). That is to say, every two or three months there will be a wave of leap forward, one wave following another, constantly revolutionizing and constantly leaping forward to new levels. According to the words of the masses, this is "everyone inserting a red flag, every section has a gift, fighting hard for three to five years, and catching up with England."

Ending the rectification movement does not mean returning to old habits, not sleeping soundly, but constantly revolutionizing after the rectification.

Xi Zhongxun finally spoke at the meeting. He said that after the great rectification movement, all departments should see a new situation like the Second Ministry of Machine Building. Everyone should foresee that ending the rectification does not mean returning to old habits, not sleeping soundly, but constantly revolutionizing after the rectification. It is necessary to use the spirit and methods of rectification to form a vigorous mass movement to implement the general line, the technological revolution, and the cultural revolution. For example, the form of the leap forward conference can be adopted. Some units hope to end the rectification sloppily and then return to "normal," which is wrong. The rectification must be thorough. After the rectification, it is still a mass movement, not "handling official affairs" behind closed doors.

Therefore, he said, it can be expected that a good set of working methods and organizational forms in the rectification movement will be retained. After the guiding principles and tasks are determined, appropriate organizational forms and working methods are extremely important.

Regarding the issue of technological revolution and cultural revolution, Xi Zhongxun said that the tasks of each department are different, but there is a common point, that is, to launch a movement for all personnel to study theory, study philosophy, especially study Chairman Mao's works, and to learn to apply materialist dialectics to practical work. This issue itself contains the issues of continuing to break down superstitions, liberate thinking, and improve leadership methods; it requires launching a movement of theory linking practice, theory linking the masses, and launching a movement to improve theoretical level and improve communist style through study.

Xi Zhongxun said that the current situation is very good, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. However, the leadership is still behind the masses and cannot keep up with the development of the situation. Many people are still in an unconscious state. For example, how to launch a new leap forward after the rectification, and how to connect the rectification movement with the technological revolution and cultural revolution. The leaders of some units have not yet paid attention to these issues.

In order to persevere in the rectification to the end and strive for complete victory, Xi Zhongxun emphasized that the closing work of the rectification is very important. He proposed that the current priority is to check the situation of "dealing with vacuity," and check according to the three "combinations," that is, whether it is combined with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, whether it is combined with the ideological reality of the unit, and whether it is combined with criticism and conducting major debates to clarify right and wrong and unify understanding. The three "combinations" are for one purpose, that is, whether they have solved the leadership thinking, policy thinking, and business thinking, eliminated dogmatism and empiricism, and clarified the guiding principles, tasks, and practices. In addition to checking the "dealing with vacuity," it is also necessary to review the rectification and reform, check the general rectification and reform, especially check the key rectification and reform, especially the problems within the scope of the Party group. If some problems become obstacles to the future Great Leap Forward, they must be resolutely and thoroughly resolved in the rectification. Secondly, each unit must do a good job in the Red and Expert debates, and first of all, do a good job in the exchange of hearts and thoughts movement. In this conscious ideological revolution movement, the main goal is to fight against bourgeois individualism, and the focus is on leading cadres above the section level and engineering and technical personnel and senior intellectuals.

    把整风运动和技术革命、文化革命密切联系起来
    在整风结尾掀起一次大跃进高潮
    中央国家机关党委扩大会议介绍二机部整风经验
    新华社22日讯  中央国家机关党委20日召开了第二十四次党委扩大会议，会上介绍了第二机械工业部整风运动的经验，最后习仲勋同志在会上讲了话，谈到了中央国家机关今后整风运动的部署和应注意的几个问题。
    这次会议所提供的情况和问题，涉及到如何把整风运动坚持到底，如何把整风运动同技术革命和文化革命衔接起来，如何把整风的精神贯彻到今后日常工作中去等问题，这些问题使各机关受到了启发。
    经验主义是最盲目的实际主义者。只有不断地加强学习，破除迷信，解放思想，才能摆脱经验主义。
    第二机械工业部的负责人首先介绍了他们部里学习和贯彻中共“八大”第二次会议的精神，在“论虚”中批判教条主义和经验主义的情况。由于打破了教条主义和经验主义的束缚，破除了迷信，解放了思想，群众的智慧和创造性充分地发挥出来，这个部最近掀起了向“七一”献礼的轰轰烈烈的跃进高潮。在整风运动的结尾掀起这样一个高潮，很自然地就使整风运动同技术革命和文化革命衔接起来。
    二机部已经进行过红专辩论，在“论虚”开始，他们着重批判了教条主义，后来进一步批判经验主义。这个部认为，经验主义是他们当前领导工作上的主要倾向，他们部的领导骨干基本上是个经验主义的“老底子”，由于在新事物面前，经验主义的“老经验”卖光了，结果便去迷信专家，迷信外国，往往成为教条主义的支持者和贩卖者。经验主义比较顽固，如果说教条主义在党内已经搞臭了，那么经验主义还并没有搞臭。犯有这种毛病的人看来整天忙忙碌碌，任劳任怨，别人容易谅解，而自己似乎也“问心无愧”。其实经验主义脱离群众，脱离实际，脱离政治，经验主义是最无原则的实际主义，是最没前途、最盲目的实际主义者。
    二机部在整风中分析了经验主义的主要表现是：一低（政治理论水平低，学习很差）；二懒（思想懒惰、安于现状）；三气（暮气、官气、骄气是经验主义的突出表现）；四无。所谓四无，首先是“脑中无线”，工作中缺乏明确的方针路线，表现为忙忙碌碌的事务主义，就事论事，不善于用党的方针路线来发动群众，进而把一切工作带动起来，不善于分析形势，从全局出发，结果抓了小的，丢了大的，只顾忙忙碌碌地拣“芝麻”，却不注意抱工作中的“大西瓜”。由于“脑中无线”，使领导工作存在很大的盲目性，缺乏自觉性。其次，经验主义表现为“目中无人”，只见物不见人，迷信制度和命令，迷信技术和专家，不相信群众，不依靠群众。结果这个部在工作中虽然涌现了大批的先进人物和先进经验，领导上却并没有发现。由于不相信群众，这就容易使工作造成慢慢腾腾、疲疲沓沓、冷冷清清的局面。第三是“心中无数”，不注意调查研究，不注意解剖“麻雀”，不注意总结经验，有些工作虽然做成功了，领导上却仍旧心中无数，缺乏系统的经验。第四，“脚下无根”，由于领导工作脱离群众、脱离实际，在工作中看不到主次，在群众中不能扎根，结果缺乏信心，下不了决心，遇到困难便容易摇摆不定。
    如何摆脱经验主义的束缚，二机部认为唯一的出路就是不断地加强学习，破除迷信，解放思想。这个部提出，今后要加强理论学习，特别是学习毛主席的著作，同时到群众中去，向群众学习，向实际学习，要求边干边学，干成学会。办法就是一靠自觉，二靠帮助。现在二机部已制定了一些制度，例如领导干部定期深入下层，每个领导干部每年要总结几篇经验，每年要解剖几个“麻雀”，党组成员每天开会或碰头时，都要谈一二个新问题、新情况，等等，通过这些制度来加以督促和保证。
    经过批判经验主义后，二机部的同志干劲冲天。决心“人人插红旗，节节有献礼，苦战三五年，赶过英吉利”。
    经过批判经验主义以后，二机部的领导干部和群众都感到工作有了信心，大家心情舒畅，干劲冲天。最近这个部召开了一次全部的工作人员跃进大会，随后又召开了全部的青年跃进大会。两次大会形成了两次比跃进、比干劲、比上游、比思想解放的大会，会上人人献计，个个献宝，会后立即在全部范围内掀起了大干、苦干的竞赛热潮。特别是青年的干劲最大，表现最活跃，他们为了制造新产品向“七一”献礼，最近许多人把铺盖搬到办公室去，夜以继日地工作。许多人中午不休息，晚上连夜工作，有的单位办公室里二十四小时内忙碌不停，白天黑夜无区别。为了实现跃进的规划，青年们不是按月按日来计算时间，而是以小时来计算，他们每隔两小时便开一次诸葛亮会，交流经验，解决困难，每天或三天检查一次工作成绩。
    按照目前的情况看来，由于群众的干劲，今年这个部将会有几十件鼓舞人心的有分量的新成就和新创造向“七一”献礼。许多原来要十年到十五年才能办到的事情，现在只要三、五年，甚至有的只要几个月就办成了。有的由于我国原来的技术水平低，不敢想像的事情，现在有把握在今年的“七一”或“十一”就超过资本主义国家水平。目前这个部已经有五项重要的技术创造提前试制成功，这五项技术创造都已经达到或超过国际水平。这种跃进使观潮派受到打击，使一切所谓“条件论”、“基础论”、“习惯论”、“把握论”者受到了深刻的教育。人们提出，“硬干出巧活，忙工出巧匠”，从实干苦干中，人们的思想得到了进一步的解放，他们说，“越干越不怕，越不干越害怕，不怕失败，失败了再来”。有的说：“开始心里没有‘底’，没把握，但是‘底’是从干中摸到的，干起来就没有什么了不起。”这些都充分体现了他们边干边学的精神。
    不仅工程技术人员鼓起了干劲，这个部所有单位都像一个整体一样共同卷入了大跃进的浪潮中。供应单位提出：“需要什么，供应什么，什么时候要，什么时候供应到”。翻译人员提出：“俄文包教保学，随叫随到”。图书馆实行了“电话借书，送上门去，一天开馆二十四小时”的规定。医务人员主动下科室，进行工作，保证工作人员的健康。甚至炊事员也动员起来，他们保证“二十四小时内有饭吃，热汤热面送到办公室”。这种生动的局面，充分地表现了全体人员共产主义觉悟的高涨，表现了团结协作精神的加强。
    整风运动结尾掀起一次大跃进的高潮，是对整风运动的一次大检阅。二机部的负责人说，为了防止整风后恢复常态，恢复整风以前那样“办公事”的老习惯，他们准备把整风运动所带来的革命精神，把领导整风运动的一套工作方法和组织形式（例如整风办公室）保留下来，运用到日常工作中去，以群众运动的方法来领导机关的经常工作。他们肯定了跃进大会的形式，根据群众的要求，准备在今后每年的“五一”、“七一”、“十一”、“元旦”和“三八”（妇女干部提出的）等节日，都要召开跃进献礼大会。这就是说每隔二、三个月便有一个跃进的浪头，一浪跟一浪，不断革命，不断向新的水平跃进。按照群众的话来说，这就是“人人插红旗，节节有献礼，苦战三五年，赶过英吉利”。
    整风结束以后不是要恢复到老习惯，不是睡大觉，整风以后要不断革命。
    习仲勋最后在会上讲了话，他说，经过伟大的整风运动，各部门都应该出现像二机部这样的新局面。大家应该预见到，整风结束以后不是要恢复到老习惯，不是睡大觉，整风以后要不断革命。要以整风的精神和方法把贯彻总路线、把技术革命和文化革命形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动，例如跃进大会的形式就可以采用。有的单位希图草率地结束整风，然后恢复到“常态”，这种想法是不对的。整风必须搞彻底，整风以后仍旧是群众运动，不是关起门来“办公事”。
    因此，他说，可以预料整风运动中一套好的工作方法和组织形式，将会保留下来。方针任务确定了以后，适当的组织形式和工作方法极为重要。
    关于技术革命和文化革命的问题，习仲勋说，各部门的任务不同，但是有一个共同点，这就是要在全体人员中掀起一个学理论、学哲学、特别是学习毛主席著作的运动，要学会把唯物辩证法运用到实际工作中去。这个问题本身就包含着继续破除迷信，解放思想，改进领导方法的问题；要求通过学习，掀起一个理论联系实际、理论联系群众的运动，掀起一个提高理论水平、提高共产主义风格的运动。
    习仲勋说，现在形势很好，群众的劲头很大，可是，领导现在还落后于群众，还赶不上形势的发展，不少人还是处于不自觉的状态。例如如何在整风以后掀起新的跃进，如何把整风运动同技术革命和文化革命衔接起来，有的单位领导上还并没有注意到这些问题。
    为了把整风坚持到底，争取全胜，习仲勋强调整风的收场工作十分重要。他提出目前首先要检查“务虚”的情况，按照三个“结合”来检查，这就是是否结合了“八大”第二次会议的精神，是否结合了本单位的思想实际，是否结合了批判，进行大争大辩，把是非弄清了，把认识统一了。三个“结合”为了一个目的，这就是是否解决了领导思想、政策思想和业务思想，破除了教条主义和经验主义，而且把方针、任务和作法弄清楚了。除了检查“务虚”以外还要复查整改，要检查一般整改，尤其要检查重点整改的情况，特别是党组范围以内的问题，如果有些问题成为今后大跃进的障碍，就必须在整风中坚决彻底地解决。再其次，各单位必须把红专辩论搞好，而首先要把交心、谈心运动搞好。在这个自觉的思想革命运动中，主要的目标是同资产阶级个人主义作斗争，而重点是科级以上的领导干部及工程技术人员和高级知识分子。
