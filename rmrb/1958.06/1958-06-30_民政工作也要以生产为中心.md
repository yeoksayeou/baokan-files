Civil Affairs Work Must Also Center on Production

The Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference has concluded. This conference summarized some policy and guideline issues that sparked debate within the civil affairs sector since the rectification campaign. It liberated the minds of civil affairs cadres, making everyone understand that to implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction in civil affairs work, it is necessary to firmly grasp three key issues in guiding ideology: ideological and political work, starting from production and serving production, and believing in and relying on the masses. Among these three issues, starting from production and serving production is the central issue. The purpose of ideological and political work is to develop production; believing in and relying on the masses is the mass line for developing production.

Ideological and political work must be placed at the forefront of civil affairs work, becoming the commander and soul of civil affairs work. The targets of civil affairs work number over 80 million nationwide, including families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled veterans, demobilized soldiers, disaster victims, the poor, vagrants, etc. Only by strengthening ideological and political work can the strength of all these people be mobilized, inspiring them to work hard, strive for the upper reaches, and contribute the greatest possible strength to socialist construction. However, some people in the past did not understand it this way. They said, "Civil affairs departments get things done with money. As long as there is money, the demands of the work targets can be met, and the problem will be solved." Is this really the case? Of course not. For those receiving preferential treatment, demobilization assistance, disaster relief, and social relief who do not have financial difficulties, the main focus is on ideological and political work. Even for those who do have financial difficulties, we must not only pay attention to solving their various life problems but also not neglect conducting ideological and political work on them. Due to their circumstances, the targets of civil affairs work often do not fully understand the overall situation of socialist construction. Their demands on the state may inevitably conflict with the limits of the assistance the state can provide. If ideological and political work is not strengthened, this contradiction cannot be resolved well. For example, in the past, some rural demobilized soldiers constantly demanded that the government arrange work for them outside of agricultural production, but from the perspective of the overall socialist construction, this demand was difficult to fulfill. Later, according to the central government's instructions, after strengthening ideological and political work on them, especially after the great debate in the countryside, this contradiction was basically resolved. Some demobilized soldiers who were once uneasy about agricultural production stated that they would "be in the countryside, have their hearts in the countryside, build in the countryside, and take root and blossom in the countryside."

Only by constantly paying attention to promoting socialist ideology and eliminating capitalist ideology in practical work can we correctly implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction in civil affairs work. For example, if a debate on the two roads is launched among disaster victims, it will enable them to rely on the collective, produce locally, eliminate the disaster, and consolidate the cooperatives. If ideological and political work is not carried out, a situation will arise where disaster victims seek their own livelihood and go their separate ways, which will not only fail to overcome the disaster but will also cause the cooperatives to fall into disarray.

Ideological and political work should be strengthened so that all targets of civil affairs work can fully play an active role in the upsurge of socialist construction. Those who are in good political condition and physical condition, especially demobilized soldiers, have not only become activists and shock forces on all fronts of socialist construction, but even the elderly, the weak, the disabled, and those whose ideological and political situation was not very good originally, after strengthening ideological and political work on them, many disabled veterans have also shown the heroic spirit of "being disabled but not lacking in ambition," making their greatest possible contribution to socialist construction. Even severely disabled veterans who are cared for by the state for life in sanatoriums have actively participated in productive activities or literary and artistic propaganda activities within their capabilities. Their noble communist style and revolutionary optimism have deeply moved the people. Many vagrants who have been taken in and reformed by civil affairs departments have also become self-reliant working people. Among them, there have been touching stories of picking up money and not pocketing it, and risking their lives to save people. Many production models have emerged, and some people have honorably joined the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League after being thoroughly reformed. All of this shows the great significance of ideological and political work in mobilizing all forces to serve socialism.

Civil affairs departments should solve social welfare problems through production. All civil affairs work should also start from production and serve production. Some people once believed that the task of civil affairs departments was not to engage in production, saying that developing socialist welfare production undertakings was "not doing proper business." Now, facts have powerfully refuted this erroneous view. The civil affairs department in Xuzhou City vigorously launched social welfare production undertakings. Since April this year, two or three million urban poor people who used to rely on relief have no longer needed state relief, and many people have reached the living standards of ordinary residents. This policy of turning passive subsidies and relief into active self-sufficiency through production can not only be promoted in cities and towns but also in rural areas. In fact, many rural areas have already done so.

If we do not start from production but adhere to a purely relief-oriented viewpoint, then even disaster relief work cannot be done well, and disaster relief work can only solve the temporary difficulties of disaster victims, but cannot promote the leap forward in agricultural production and cannot enable farmers to permanently get rid of the threat of disasters. Conversely, wherever disaster relief work is combined with agricultural production and disaster prevention construction, a new situation has emerged in the disaster area, realizing the great ideal of changing the natural features of the disaster area and turning it into a high-yield area. In individual places, because disaster relief work was divorced from disaster prevention construction and agricultural production, many difficulties were increased, creating a passive situation. Only after resolutely changing this passive disaster relief policy was this passive situation reversed. This experience and lesson should be firmly remembered.

Developing production in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way is the core of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and also the regular central task of Party committees at all levels. Civil affairs departments must arrange their various tasks around this central task so that all civil affairs work can well serve the Party's central task.

Then, should the people's living difficulties be completely solved by relying on the strength of the state, or mainly by relying on the strength of the people themselves? Of course, it should be the latter, not the former. In civil affairs work, we should believe in and rely on the masses and follow the mass line. In practical work, some people often ignore this most basic principle. They say that preferential treatment and relief work must be done by the state or the collective spending money. Without money, nothing can be done, and with little money, things cannot be done well. Facts have proved that this statement is completely wrong. As long as we follow the mass line and implement the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical, the state does not spend money or only spends very little money, and relies on the organized masses to completely solve their own living difficulties very well. In disaster relief work, relying on the collective strength of the cooperatives, giving full play to the revolutionary vigor and communist spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance of the disaster victims, the state does not allocate a lot of relief funds, or even does not need state funding at all, and the disaster can also be overcome.

Although the service targets of urban preferential treatment and relief work are all the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, organizing the majority of them who have a certain labor capacity to participate in social welfare production, they are an extraordinary production team, which can not only save themselves but also create a lot of wealth for society. Recently, in many places, under voluntary conditions, the rural "five guarantees" targets have been organized in the form of "production and education homes," and they have exerted greater strength in production. In this way, not only can the burden of the cooperatives on the "five guarantees" households be reduced, but also their income can be increased and their lives can be improved. Therefore, in civil affairs work, as long as the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and following the mass line is implemented, it is possible to rely on the strength of the preferential treatment and relief targets themselves to enable them to move from poverty to prosperity. In this way, in civil affairs work, a situation will emerge where the state's preferential treatment subsidies and relief expenditures are increasingly reduced, while the lives of tens of millions of preferential treatment and relief targets are increasingly improved, and various welfare undertakings in urban and rural areas can be developed more and faster.

Although the content and specific policies of various civil affairs work are different, we must firmly grasp the above three issues in the overall guiding ideology, and take production as the center, as the red line running through various specific tasks. In this way, civil affairs work can be illuminated by the beacon of the Party's General Line, go all out, aim high, leap forward in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and fully play its role in promoting socialist construction.

### 民政工作也要以生产为中心

    民政工作也要以生产为中心
    第四次全国民政会议闭幕了。这次会议把整风以来民政部门引起辩论的一些政策方针问题作了总结，解放了民政干部的思想，使大家懂得在民政工作中要贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，必须在指导思想上紧紧抓住三个关键性的问题，即：思想政治工作问题，从生产出发、为生产服务的问题；相信群众、依靠群众的问题。在这三个问题当中，从生产出发、为生产服务的问题是个中心问题。思想政治工作的目的是为了发展生产；相信群众和依靠群众是发展生产的群众路线。
    思想政治工作必须放在民政工作的首位，成为民政工作中的统帅和灵魂。民政工作对象在全国有八千多万，其中包括烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、灾民、贫民、游民等等。只有加强思想政治工作才能很好地把所有这些人的力量都调动起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为社会主义建设贡献最大的力量。但是，过去有些人并不是这样认识的。他们说：“民政部门是靠钱办事的，只要有钱就能满足工作对象的要求，就算解决了问题。”事情果真是这样吗？当然不是的。对优抚、复员、救灾、社会救济工作的服务对象中生活没有困难的，当然主要是做思想政治工作；就是对那些生活有困难的，也不能只注意为他们解决这样那样的生活问题，而忽视对他们进行思想政治工作。民政工作对象，由于他们所处的地位，常常不大了解整个社会主义建设的全部情况，他们对于国家的要求有时难免有同国家所能提供的帮助的限度发生矛盾，如果不加强对他们的思想政治工作，就不能很好地解决这种矛盾。例如，过去有些农村复员军人不断地要求政府给他们安排农业生产以外的工作，但是从整个社会主义建设的情况来说，他们这种要求是难于实现的。后来，根据中央的指示，加强了对他们的思想政治工作以后，特别是经过农村的大辩论以后，这种矛盾基本解决了。部分曾经不安心于农业生产的复员军人表示，要“人在农村，心在农村，建设在农村，在农村生根开花”。
    只有在实际工作中时刻注意兴社会主义思想，灭资本主义思想，才能正确地在民政工作中贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线。例如，在灾民中如果开展两条道路的辩论，就能够使灾民依靠集体，就地生产，既消灭了灾荒，又巩固了合作社；如果不进行思想政治工作，就会出现灾民自谋生活，各奔前程的局面，这样，不但不能战胜灾荒，而且会使合作社陷于涣散状态。
    应当通过加强思想政治工作，让民政工作对象都能在社会主义建设跃进高潮中充分发挥积极作用。政治情况、身体条件都好的人特别是复员军人，不但大多数已经成为社会主义建设各个战线上的积极分子和突击力量，就是老弱残废和原来思想政治状况不大好的人加强对他们的思想政治工作以后，许多残废军人也都表现了“人残志不残”的英雄气概，在社会主义建设中做出了自己所能做到的最大贡献。甚至在教养院中休养的由国家供养终身的重残废军人，也都积极地参加了力所能及的生产活动或文艺宣传活动。他们的这种高尚的共产主义风格和革命的乐观主义精神，使人民群众深受感动。民政部门收容改造的游民，不少也已经变成了自食其力的劳动人民，在他们中间还出现了拾金不昧，舍命救人的感人事迹，出现了不少生产模范，有的人在经过彻底改造之后已经光荣地参加了共产党或共青团。这些都说明了思想政治工作，对调动一切力量为社会主义服务具有如何重大的意义。
    民政部门应该通过生产解决社会福利问题。各项民政工作也都要从生产出发，为生产服务。曾经有些人认为民政部门的任务不是搞生产，说发展社会主义福利生产事业是“不务正业”。现在，事实已经有力地批驳了这种错误观点。徐州市的民政部门大力开展了社会福利生产事业，从今年4月开始，两三万过去靠救济为生的城市贫民，已经不需要国家救济，许多人已经达到了一般居民的生活水平。这种变消极的补助救济为积极的生产自给的方针不但可以在城镇推行，而且也可以在农村推行，实际上许多地方的农村已经这样做了。
    如果不从生产出发，而抱定单纯救济观点，那末，连救灾工作也不可能做好，而使救灾工作只能解决灾民的临时困难，不能促进农业生产的跃进，不能使农民永远摆脱灾荒的威胁。反之，凡是把救灾工作同农业生产和防灾建设结合进行的地方，就使灾区出现了新局面，实现了改变灾区自然面貌、变灾区为丰产区的伟大理想。个别地方因为救灾工作同防灾建设和农业生产互相脱节，增加了许多困难，造成被动局面。在坚决改变了这种消极的救灾方针之后，才把这种被动的局面扭转过来。这种经验教训应该牢牢记住。
    多快好省地发展生产是党的社会主义建设总路线的核心，也是各级党委的经常的中心任务。民政部门必须围绕这一中心任务去安排自己的各项工作，使各项民政工作都能很好地为党的中心任务服务。
    那末，群众的生活困难是应该完全依靠国家的力量来解决，还是主要依靠群众自己的力量去解决？当然应当是后者而不应当是前者。在民政工作中应当相信和依靠群众，走群众路线。在实际工作中有些人却往往忽视了这条最基本的原则。他们说优抚救济工作是必须由国家或集体花钱的工作，没钱是不能办事的，钱少也不能把事办好。事实证明，这种说法是完全错误的。只要走群众路线，贯彻多快好省的方针，国家不花钱或者只花很少的钱，依靠组织起来的群众完全可以把他们本身的生活困难解决得很好。在救灾工作上，依靠合作社的集体力量，发挥灾民的革命干劲和共产主义的协作互助精神，国家不拨很多救济款，甚至根本不用国家拨款，灾荒也能够被克服。
    城镇优抚救济工作的服务对象虽然都是老弱残废，但是把其中大多数有一定劳动能力的人组织起来，参加社会福利生产，他们就是一支不平凡的生产队伍，不但能够自救，而且能够为社会创造大量财富。近来，不少地方在自愿的条件下，把农村的“五保”对象，用“生产教养院”之类的形式组织起来，他们在生产上就发挥出更大的力量。这样，不但可以减轻合作社对“五保”户的负担，而且增加了他们的收入，改善了他们的生活。因此，在民政工作中，只要执行放手发动群众、走群众路线的方针，就能够依靠优抚救济对象本身的力量，使他们由贫困走向富裕。这样，在民政工作中就会出现这样的局面：国家的优抚补助和救济支出日益缩减，而几千万优抚救济对象的生活却日益改善，城乡的各项福利事业得以更多更快的发展起来。
    各项民政工作的内容和具体政策虽然不同，但是在总的指导思想上紧紧抓住以上三个问题，并且以生产为中心，作为贯串在各项具体工作中的红线。这样，就可以使民政工作在党的总路线灯塔照耀下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地向前跃进，充分发挥它对社会主义建设的促进作用。
