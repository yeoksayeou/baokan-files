New Achievements

	Creation of Young Teachers and Students

	The First TV Station for Teaching Purposes
	China's first TV station for teaching and scientific research has been successfully built by the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. It includes a complete set of equipment such as cameras, microphones, transmitting antennas, and television sets.

	Self-manufacturing a complete set of TV station equipment is a scientific research project of the Postal and Telecommunications Institute in line with television courses. Initially, it was the responsibility of the Broadcasting Teaching and Research Group. Due to the lack of equipment, the work progressed slowly. Last year, with the Soviet Union’s donation of super-iconoscope tubes and other equipment, and the full cooperation of other teaching and research groups, the research work made faster progress. Recently, all the teachers, students, and workers of the internship factory gave full play to their revolutionary vigor. Under the guidance of Soviet expert Sorenzhong, after seven days and nights of hard work, the TV station was initially completed at the end of May.

	One Furnace of Steel in One Hour and Twenty-Seven Minutes
	The workers and students of the metallurgical factory of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, who participated in work-study programs, created an excellent achievement of smelting a furnace of tool carbon steel in one hour and twenty-seven minutes on June 8.

	In the past, they only produced four furnaces of steel per day using this electric arc furnace, with an average smelting time of two hours and fifty-four minutes per furnace and a power consumption of 863 kilowatt-hours. Some people wanted to adopt new technical measures, but were afraid that it would affect the quality of the steel as stated in some "theoretical" documents, so they hesitated.

	The teachers of the Metallurgical Teaching and Research Group, the workers of the metallurgical factory, and the students were determined to break superstitions and adopt new technical measures such as calcium carbide ferrosilicon forced deoxidation. In addition, the production organization and coordination were well done, which shortened the smelting time by half, creating a new achievement of producing eight furnaces of steel per day, ensuring quality, and reducing power consumption to 460 kilowatt-hours.

	Two Tsinghua Students Improve Power Plant Design
	While interning at the Fengman Power Plant, Xie Xingjian and Gong Hua, members of the Communist Youth League from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, proposed an improved plan for the main problems of the plant's system and made a design that minimized the amount of construction work required. The installation costs alone could save 720,000 yuan, and also save a set of power generation equipment capable of generating 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.

	When Xie Xingjian and Gong Hua accepted this special project, they immediately began collecting data, went deep into the workshops, consulted with workers and technicians, and worked with them on shifts to understand the power consumption situation. They conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and studies on the original eight improvement plans, and made bold improvements in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    青年师生的创造
    第一套教学用的电视台
    我国第一座教学和科学研究用的电视台，已经由北京邮电学院自制成功。它包括有摄象机、传声器、发射天线和电视机等一整套设备。
    自制整套电视台设备是邮电学院配合电视课程的一个科学研究项目。起初由广播教研组负责，由于缺乏器材，工作进展很慢。去年，得到了苏联赠送的超电子象管等器材，其他各教研组也通力协作，因此研究工作有了较快的进展。最近全院师生和实习工厂工人发挥了革命干劲，在苏联专家索伦仲指导下，经过七昼夜苦战，终于在5月底初步建成了电视台。
    一时二十七分炼一炉钢
    北京钢铁工业学院冶金工厂工人和参加勤工俭学的学生，在6月8日创造了一小时二十七分炼出一炉工具碳素钢的优异成绩。
    过去，他们利用这座电弧炉每天只出四炉钢，平均每炉钢的冶炼时间是二小时五十四分，耗电量是八百六十三度。有的人虽然也想采用新的技术措施，但又怕像某些“理论”文献上所说的会影响到钢的质量，因而裹足不前。
    冶金教研组的教师、冶金工厂的工人和学生们决心破除迷信，采取了电石矽铁强制脱氧等新的技术措施，加上生产组织和配合工作做得好，因而使冶炼时间缩短了一半，创造了每天出八炉钢的新成绩，并且保证了质量，耗电量也降到四百六十度。
    清华两学生改进电厂设计
    清华大学电机系学生共青团员谢行健、贡华在丰满电厂毕业实习时，对厂用系统的主要问题，提出了改进方案，并且作出设计，使施工量达到了最小限度，仅安装费一项就可节约七十二万元，并且节约了一套每年可发一千万度电的发电设备。
    谢行健、贡华在接受这个专题时，立即着手收集资料，深入到车间，向工人和技术人员请教，并同他们一起值班，了解用电情况。他们对原有的八个改进方案，进行深入而细致的调查研究，根据多快好省的方针，作了大胆的改进。
