　　National Summer Athletics Meet Begins
　　Five Athletes Break National Records

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 1st. The 1958 National Summer Athletics Meet began in Shanghai today. In the ten events that concluded today, five athletes broke five national records.

　　The famous female high jumper, Zheng Fengrong, broke the national record of 2,169 points with a score of 2,405 points in the women's triathlon (100 meters, shot put, high jump) all-around competition. This score improved upon her previous record of 2,339 points, which she set in Guangzhou in February of this year, by another 66 points.

　　This afternoon, the sky was covered with dark clouds. When Zheng Fengrong participated in the last event of the women's triathlon, the high jump, it had already started to rain. She easily cleared 1.70 meters. At this point, the rain had become heavy, but thousands of spectators standing on the south side of the high jump stand remained steadfast. Zheng Fengrong attempted 1.75 meters three times in the rain, but was unsuccessful.

　　The men's pole vault was particularly eye-catching. This competition started at 3:30 PM and lasted until around 7:30 PM. Guangdong athlete Cai Meicheng cleared 4.33 meters, which, although 7 centimeters lower than Cai Yishu's record of 4.40 meters set in Shanghai in March of this year, broke the national record of 4.32 meters. After clearing 4.33 meters, Cai Meicheng then attempted 4.42 meters, but was unsuccessful in three attempts. The second place in this event was Ouyang Zaihuang (4.22 meters), and the third place was Xu Tiquan (4.10 meters). Famous athlete Cai Yishu did not participate in the competition due to illness.

　　In the hammer throw final, Shandong athlete Bi Hongfu broke his own national record of 50.68 meters with a throw of 52.28 meters. Today's men's and women's long jump competitions were both very exciting. In the men's pentathlon long jump competition, People's Liberation Army athlete Zhang Qishan exceeded the national record in two attempts, once with 7.43 meters and once with 7.53 meters.

　　Female long jumper Liu Xingyu refreshed the national record of 5.54 meters today with a jump of 5.77 meters.

　　全国夏季田径运动会开始
    有五名运动员打破全国纪录
    据新华社上海1日电　1958年全国夏季田径运动会今天开始在上海举行。在今天进行的十个项目的决赛中，有五名运动员打破了五项全国纪录。
    著名女子跳高选手郑凤荣，在参加女子三项（一百公尺、铅球、跳高）全能比赛中，以二千四百零五分的成绩打破了二千一百六十九分的全国纪录，这个成绩比她今年2月间在广州创造的二千三百三十九分的成绩又提高了六十六分。
    今天下午天空黑云密布，当郑凤荣参加女子三项全能的最后一项——跳高比赛时，已经下起雨来。她轻松地跳过了一点七○公尺，这时，雨已下得很大，但是紧靠在跳高架南面的看台上，上千名观众毅然屹立不动。郑凤荣冒雨三次试跳一点七五公尺都没有成功。
    男子撑竿跳高特别引人注目。这项比赛从下午三时半开始，一直进行到七点半左右。广东选手蔡美成跳过了四点三三公尺，这个成绩虽比蔡艺墅今年3月在上海创造的四点四○公尺的成绩低七公分，但已打破四点三二公尺的全国纪录。蔡美成跳过四点三三公尺后接着试跳四点四二公尺，但三次都没有成功。这个项目的第二名是欧阳载黄（四点二二公尺），第三名是徐体权（四点一○公尺）。著名选手蔡艺墅因病没有参加比赛。
    在链球决赛中，山东选手毕鸿福以五十二点二八公尺的成绩打破了他自己保持的五○点六八公尺的全国纪录。今天的男女跳远比赛都非常精彩，解放军选手张启山在男子五项的跳远比赛中，两次试跳都超过了全国纪录，一次是七点四三公尺，一次是七点五三公尺。
    女子跳远运动健将刘兴玉，今天以五点七七公尺的成绩，刷新了五点五四公尺的全国纪录。
