Where Does Consistent Understanding Come From?
Song Zheng

    During the rectification movement, the cadres of one department posted a big-character poster titled "It's Really Difficult!" to their leaders. This poster stated that one leading comrade of the department, upon returning from abroad, instructed the subordinates to catch up with the world's advanced level, requiring higher technical equipment standards. Another leading comrade, also returning from abroad, instructed to simplify things as much as possible. The main leading comrade of the department, however, claimed to be a "moderate" on the matter. Three leading comrades with three different views truly made things difficult for the subordinates! This poster indeed reflected a significant problem that existed in the leadership of this department in the past. Previously, the differing opinions among the leaders of this department were not debated among the leadership members to seek a consistent understanding. Instead, these differing opinions were avoided, or compromises were made, diluting the differences in understanding. Now, the leaders of this department have changed this situation, and when discussing issues, they can put all kinds of different opinions on the table for debate, finally seeking a consistent understanding.
    During the rectification movement, many units learned how to recognize and treat the problem of differences in opinion among comrades. After the rectification movement, this problem will still be frequently encountered in daily work. How to draw on the experience of the rectification movement to achieve consistency in everyone's thinking and action is crucial to ensuring solidarity among comrades and strengthening the collective fighting power.
    As the saying goes, ten fingers are never of equal length. Although our comrades all want to act according to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies, because each person has different experiences, different knowledge of the situation, and their ways of thinking may not be fully in line with Marxist-Leninist principles, everyone will have their own views on implementing the Party's policies and formulating certain plans, just like the aforementioned department's leading comrades having different views on technical equipment issues. This is very natural and normal. It is unreasonable and impossible to demand that comrades have a consistent view on issues before they have been collectively discussed and decided. Comrades not only have different views on things, but also, because everyone's cultivation and work style are not entirely the same, they will inevitably have some opinions of each other. Therefore, consistency of opinion among comrades is relative, and inconsistency is frequent and absolute.
    Denying inconsistency is unacceptable, and there is no need to fear inconsistency. This does not mean that everyone can have their own views and act in their own way regarding the work that is currently being or is about to be carried out, without seeking consistency. The reason why we need leadership and why we need to hold meetings to discuss issues is precisely to ensure consistency in everyone's thinking and action on major issues. Without this consistency, any organization will fall into a state of disunity and weakness. Is it not a contradiction to say that inconsistency is absolute, and yet emphasize the need for consistency? Actually, it is not. The most basic principle of dialectics tells us that contradictions can be unified through struggle. Inconsistency can be resolved through debate and discussion to achieve consistency. However, never hope for a permanent solution. One meeting and one debate can resolve the inconsistency on this issue and achieve consistency. However, before long, inconsistency arises again on another issue. Things are constantly developing and changing, and with development and change, new inconsistencies will constantly arise. Therefore, leaders need to constantly pay attention to the new inconsistencies that are constantly occurring in their team, constantly organize debates, and carry out criticism to solve these problems. The idea of ​​seeking a permanent solution without constantly paying attention to this issue is a metaphysical idea that denies the development and change of things and denies the absoluteness of contradictions.
    The key to achieving consistency lies in conducting serious and earnest debates. To start a debate, we first need to present different opinions to clarify the contradictions. Some comrades have a vague understanding of this point. They are not only unwilling to establish opposing viewpoints, but even afraid to face them squarely, and even more afraid to let the opposing viewpoints engage in struggle. These comrades often make a fuss when they hear that some people's opinions are inconsistent, thinking that this is a very abnormal phenomenon. On the contrary, these comrades are treating a normal phenomenon as an abnormal phenomenon. If everyone's views are completely consistent on issues that have not been collectively discussed and decided, if several comrades have been together for a long time without any opinions of each other, then that is truly an abnormal phenomenon! Demanding that everyone's views have no differences is just like demanding that ten fingers are of equal length, hoping that things have no contradictions or differences. This does not conform to the objective laws of the development of things. In fact, inconsistency is the basis of consistency. The two are contradictory and interdependent. Without inconsistency, there is no such thing as consistency. If you are unwilling to admit that everyone has different views, it is impossible to discuss and debate different views and obtain consistent views. Whether you admit it or not, whether you are afraid or not, inconsistency is an objective reality. If you do not unify them through struggle, they will still exist. In this way, comrades cannot have a common language and consistent actions.
    Some comrades avoid struggle because they are afraid of harming the solidarity among comrades. The Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party has long pointed out that Party unity is unity based on Marxism-Leninism, unity based on correct political and organizational principles. Fearing struggle, fearing criticism, failing to distinguish between right and wrong, and failing to distinguish between correctness and fallacy can only result in vulgar harmony, not the unity required by the Party. In fact, if conflicting opinions are not unified, and ideas do not meet and clash, it is difficult for everyone to cooperate comfortably. The leading comrades of the aforementioned department originally had no personal grievances. It was only because their views on some issues were inconsistent and had not been resolved that they were a little unnatural and unpleasant with each other. Recently, after more debates, inconsistent opinions have been unified through debate, and leading cadres have become more harmonious with each other. Although they blushed during the debate, they all felt relaxed and comfortable after the debate. Conversely, if a lot of inconsistent opinions accumulate, there will inevitably be disharmony in the work and even mutual restraint. Over time, misunderstandings will occur between comrades, and unprincipled disputes will be mixed with principled debates, and even serious disunity will occur. Before the rectification movement, this kind of lesson was not isolated. Although these types of problems have recently been resolved, the lessons must be firmly remembered.
    There is also such a situation: the opposing viewpoint has already appeared, and the person presiding over the meeting also asks everyone to start a debate, but everyone is silent. What is the reason? The main reason is that many comrades still lack the habit of debating issues with others, and lack the courage to think and speak, and not be afraid of making mistakes. Some comrades are always embarrassed to refute other people's opinions and defend their own opinions in a tit-for-tat manner, as if doing so has a bit of a "demeaning others to elevate themselves" flavor. Of course, we are resolutely opposed to demeaning others to elevate themselves from an individualistic standpoint. However, in ideological matters, it is okay to "demean" others a little and "elevate" yourself a little. What needs to be "demeaned" and "elevated" here are naturally arguments, not people; and the so-called "demeaning" and "elevating" are nothing more than arguing with reason rather than anything else. The reason for saying this is to hope that a atmosphere of independent thinking and daring to argue, that is courageous in upholding the truth and does not easily agree with other people's views, can be formed. Of course, this does not mean that a person can be stubborn and unwilling to listen to good advice. The debate mentioned here is for upholding the truth, and is carried out after fully considering the other party's opinions, and feeling that they are indeed incorrect. If the other party's opinions are not repeatedly and calmly considered, or if one has already discovered that one is wrong but is unwilling to admit the mistake, and still wants to debate endlessly, then it can only be said to be sophistry and quarrel, not the debate that we advocate.
    Debate itself is not the purpose. After a decision is made through debate, everyone's responsibility is to ensure consistency of action and ensure the thorough implementation of the resolution. At this time, if someone still does not implement or violates the collective decision because they personally retain different opinions (which is allowed), then that is not daring to think, speak, and argue, but is acting in an undisciplined and anarchistic way. Before the issue is decided, let go and organize the opposing viewpoints to conduct a debate; after the issue is decided, resolutely maintain the seriousness of the resolution. This point is very important. Otherwise, an organization cannot be united and combat-effective.

### 一致的认识从哪里来？

    一致的认识从哪里来？
    宋琤
    在整风运动中，有一个部门的干部曾经给领导上贴了一张以“真难呀”为题的大字报。这张大字报说：这个部门的一位负责同志从国外回来指示下边要赶上世界先进水平，技术装备标准要高些；另一位负责同志也是从国外回来，却指示要尽量因陋就简；而这个部门的主要负责同志说在这个问题上他是“中间派”。三位负责同志有三种看法，真使下边的同志难办！这张大字报的确反映出过去这个部门领导上存在的一个重要问题。过去，这个部门的领导之间的不同意见，长期未能在领导成员之间展开争论，求得一致认识，而是避开这些不同意见，或者是调和折衷，冲淡了认识上的分歧。现在这个部门的领导已经改变了这种状况，讨论问题的时候，能够把各种不同的意见都摆到桌面上进行辩论，最后求得一致的认识。
    整风运动中，很多单位都学会了怎样认识对待同志之间意见不一致的问题。整风运动结束后，在日常工作中仍然会经常碰到这个问题。如何吸取整风运动中的经验，求得大家思想和行动的一致，这对于保证同志之间的团结一致，增强集体的战斗力量，有着决定的意义。
    俗话说：十个指头伸出来不会一般齐。我们的同志们虽然都是想按照马克思列宁主义的原则和党的方针政策办事，可是，因为每个人的经历和经验不同、所掌握的情况不同、思想方法也不一定都完全符合马克思列宁主义原则，因此，对于贯彻党的方针政策，以及制定某些方针计划的时候，各个人都会有各自的看法，正像上述那个部门的几位负责同志对技术装备问题看法不一致一样，这是很自然很正常的事情。要求同志们在问题没有经过集体讨论和决定以前就有一致的看法，是不合理的，也是不可能的。同志之间不但对事物会有不同的看法，而且因为各人的修养、作风不尽相同，彼此之间便不免会经常有些意见，因此，同志之间的意见一致是相对的，不一致则是经常的、绝对的。
    不能否认不一致，不必害怕不一致，决不是说大家对于当前正在或即将进行的工作可以各有各的看法和各行其是，而不必去求得一致。所以要有领导，所以要开会来讨论问题，正是为了保证在重大问题上大家思想和行动的一致。没有这种一致，任何组织都会陷于涣散无力状态。既说不一致是绝对的，又强调需要一致，这不是自相矛盾吗？其实并不。辩证法的最基本原理告诉我们，矛盾经过斗争就可以达到统一。不一致经过争辩讨论就可以达到一致。但是，决不要希望一劳永逸。开一次会议经过一次辩论，可以解决在这个问题上的不一致而达到一致。可是，过不多久，在另一个问题上的不一致就又发生了。事物是不断发展变化的，有发展有变化，就会不断有新的不一致产生。因此，领导者就需要经常地注意自己的队伍中不断发生的新的不一致，不断组织辩论，开展批评来解决这些问题。那种企图一劳永逸而不经常注意这个问题的想法，是一种否认事物的发展变化否认矛盾的绝对性的形而上学的想法。
    求得一致的关键在于认真严肃地展开辩论。要展开辩论，首先需要把不同的意见摆出来，让矛盾明朗化。有些同志恰恰在这一点上认识模糊，不但不愿意树立对立面，甚至害怕正视对立面，更不敢放手让对立面进行斗争。这些同志往往一听到有些人的意见不一致，就大惊小怪起来，以为这是很不正常的现象。恰恰相反，倒是这些同志把正常的现象当成了反常现象，如果大家对于未经集体讨论决定的问题，看法都完全一致，如果几个同志长期相处而彼此没有任何意见，那才真是反常现象！要求大家的看法没有分歧，这正像要求十个手指一般齐，希望事物没有矛盾差异一样，是不符合事物发展的客观规律的。其实，不一致正是一致的基础，这二者是互相矛盾又互相依存的，没有不一致也就无所谓一致了。不愿意承认大家有不同的看法，就不可能对不同的看法进行讨论和争辩，而得到一致的看法。不管你承认不承认，害怕不害怕，不一致是客观存在，不经过斗争使它们统一起来，它们就依然存在。这样，同志们之间就不可能有共同语言和一致行动。
    有些同志所以回避斗争，是害怕伤害同志之间的团结。党的七届四中全会关于增强党的团结的决议中早已指出，党的团结是在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，是在正确的政治原则和组织原则的基础上的团结。害怕斗争、害怕批评，不分清是非，不辨别正确和谬误，所得到的只能是庸俗的一团和气，而不是党所要求的团结。实际上，分歧的意见不统一起来，思想没有见面和交锋，大家就很难心情舒畅地合作共事。上述的那个部门的领导同志之间本来没有任何个人嫌隙，就只是因为对有些问题的看法不一致而又没有得到解决，彼此之间就有点不够自然、不够愉快。最近，争论多了，不一致的意见经过争论一致起来了，领导干部彼此之间反而更加融洽了，尽管争论时弄得面红耳赤，争论后却都轻松舒畅。相反地，如果不一致的意见积得很多，工作中不免有不谐调以至互相掣肘，久而久之就使同志之间发生误会，在原则争论之中夹杂上无原则纠纷，甚至发生严重的不团结现象。这种教训在整风运动以前并不是个别的。尽管这类问题最近已经得到解决，但是，教训却不可不牢牢记取。
    也还有这样的情况：对立面已经出现了，主持会议的人也要求大家展开争论，但是，大家却沉默了。原因何在呢？主要在于不少同志还缺乏和别人争论问题的习惯，还缺少敢想敢说、不怕错误的气魄。有些同志总不大好意思针锋相对地去批驳别人的意见，辩护自己的意见，好像这样做多少有点“打击别人抬高自己”的味道。当然，我们是坚决反对从个人主义的立场出发去打击别人抬高自己的。但是，在思想问题上却不妨“打击”一下别人，“抬高”一下自己。这里要“打击”的要“抬高”的自然都是论点，而不是人；而所谓“打击”和“抬高”也无非是据理争辩而不是其他。所以要这样说，是希望能够形成一种勇于维护真理，不轻易苟同别人看法的独立思考、敢于争论的风气。当然，这决不是说一个人可以固执己见而不从善如流。这里所说的争论是为了坚持真理，在充分地考虑了对方的意见以后，而确实感到它是不正确的情况下进行的。如果不反复地冷静地考虑对方的意见，或者是已经发现了自己不对而不愿承认错误，而还要无休止的辩论，那就只能说是诡辩争吵，而不是我们所提倡的争论了。
    争论本身并不是目的。经过争论作出决定以后，大家的责任就是保证行动的一致，保证切实贯彻执行决议。这时候如果还有人因为个人保留有不同意见（这是允许的），就不执行或者违背集体的决定，那就不是敢想敢说敢争，而是无组织无纪律和分散主义的行为了。在问题未决定前放手组织对立面进行争论；在问题决定以后，就坚决维护决议的严肃性。这一点非常重要，否则，一个组织仍然不可能团结一致和富有战斗力量。
