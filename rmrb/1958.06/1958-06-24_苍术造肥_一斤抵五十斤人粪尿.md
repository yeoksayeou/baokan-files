    One Jin is Equivalent to Fifty Jin of Human Manure
    (Our dispatch) 社员 members of the Liaoyuan Second Commune in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, have actively learned from the advanced experiences of Hubei Province and have also successfully trial-produced Cangzhu fertilizer. One jin of Cangzhu fertilizer concentrate is equivalent to fifty jin of human manure, and the fertilizing effect is truly astonishing.
    The main raw materials for Cangzhu fertilizer are Cangzhu (a medicinal plant), ammonium sulfate, and water. The method is as follows: First, take one jin of Cangzhu, dry it, grind it into powder, add ten jin of ammonium sulfate and fifty jin of water, mix thoroughly, then put it into a clay jar or bucket, seal it for twelve to eighteen days, and then take it out for use. When using, mix two jin of Cangzhu fertilizer concentrate with one hundred jin of water for spot application or spreading.

    苍术造肥的主要原料是苍术（药用植物）、硫酸铵和水。作法是：先用苍术一斤，烘干研碎，加入十斤硫酸铵、五十斤水，充分捣拌，再盛入瓦缸或水桶中，封闭十二至十八天，取出使用。使用时，每两斤苍术造肥原液掺水一百斤，进行点施或泼施。
