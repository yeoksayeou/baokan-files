Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 15th: According to TASS, the Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Science and Technology, Maksarev, recently stated that in 1957, the average steel production per square meter of production area in Soviet steelmaking workshops was 7.5 tons, while in American steelmaking workshops, the average steel production per square meter of production area was only 5.6 tons.

Maksarev made these remarks at an evening event held by the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge. During the event, he also compared labor productivity in the Soviet and American ironmaking industries. He said that workers at the Magnitogorsk blast furnace workshop in the Soviet Union produced an average of 7,138 tons of pig iron per person per year. The Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Combine and the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Plant achieved 6,816 tons and 5,530 tons, respectively, in this area. In contrast, workers at the Harris Corporation's blast furnaces, a leading American steel industrial enterprise, could only produce an average of 4,900 tons of pig iron per person per year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 15th: According to TASS, the Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Science and Technology, Maksarev, told a group of American steel industry experts on the 11th that the Soviet Union is currently designing some unprecedentedly huge blast furnaces. Each such blast furnace will have a volume of 2,200 cubic meters and can produce 4,000 tons of pig iron per day, which is 50% to 100% higher than the production of the largest blast furnaces in the Soviet Union and the United States.

He said that the efficiency of Soviet blast furnaces is already the highest in the world, and the efficiency of the giant blast furnaces being designed will be 10% to 20% higher than that of existing Soviet blast furnaces.

Maksarev recently met with a delegation of American steel industry experts visiting the Soviet Union. After he spoke about the achievements of the Soviet steel industry and the giant blast furnaces currently being designed, the deputy head of the delegation, Stevens, admitted that the American steel industry still needs to make great efforts to reach the production targets that the Soviet steel industry has already achieved. A member of the delegation, Jenks, an expert from "United States Steel Corporation," believes that due to the use of highly refractory chrome-magnesite bricks, the service life of Soviet open-hearth furnaces is much longer than that of American open-hearth furnaces.

Maksarev also told the American experts that in the Soviet steel industry, the production process of directly reducing pig iron from ore will soon be realized. Moreover, the construction of electric furnaces also has great development prospects in the Soviet Union.

    苏联炼钢技术远远超过美国
    现正设计空前巨大的高炉每昼夜产铁四千吨
    比目前苏美最大高炉生产量高半倍到一倍
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国家科学技术委员会主席马克萨烈夫最近说，1957年苏联钢铁工业炼钢车间每平方公尺生产面积平均生产七点五吨钢，而在美国的炼钢车间中，每平方公尺生产面积只平均产钢五点六吨。
    马克萨烈夫是在全苏政治和科学知识普及协会举行的晚会上这样说的。他在这次晚会上还把苏联和美国炼铁工业中的劳动生产率作了比较。他说，苏联的马格尼托哥尔斯克高炉车间的工人每人每年平均炼出七千一百三十八吨生铁，库兹?茨克钢铁联合工厂和新塔吉尔钢铁工厂在这方面的成绩分别为六千八百一十六吨和五千五百三十吨；而美国的先进的钢铁工业企业哈里公司的高炉工人每人每年平均只能生产四千九百吨生铁。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国家科学技术委员会主席马克萨烈夫11日对一批美国钢铁工业专家说，苏联现在正在设计一些空前巨大的高炉。每座这样的高炉的容积达两千二百立方公尺，每昼夜可以生产四千吨生铁，这比目前苏联和美国最大的高炉的生产量还高50％到一倍。
    他说，苏联的高炉的效率现在已经是世界上最高的，而正在设计的巨型高炉的效率还要比苏联现有的高炉高10％到20％。
    马克萨烈夫最近接见了正在苏联访问的美国钢铁工业专家代表团。在他谈到苏联钢铁工业的成就和现在正在设计的巨型高炉的情况以后，代表团副团长斯蒂文斯承认：美国钢铁工业还要作很大努力才能达到苏联钢铁工业现在已经达到的生产指标。代表团团员、“美国钢铁公司”的专家詹克斯认为，由于采用了高度耐火的铬镁砖，苏联的平炉使用年限要比美国的平炉的使用年限长得多。
    马克萨烈夫还告诉美国专家，在苏联钢铁工业中，很快就可以实现从矿石直接还原生铁的生产过程。而且，电炉建设在苏联也有很大的发展前途。
