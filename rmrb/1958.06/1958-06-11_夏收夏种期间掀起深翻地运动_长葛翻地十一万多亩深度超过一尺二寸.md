Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th: Farmers in Changge County, Henan Province, known throughout the country for their deep plowing of land, have deeply plowed more than 117,000 mu of land during the intense summer harvest and planting season (from May 30th to June 6th), all to a depth of more than 1.2 chi. This year, this county's 500,000 mu of summer-sown farmland will be universally deep-plowed before sowing, creating conditions for an even greater autumn harvest.

During the spring plowing this year, Changge County had universally deep-plowed more than 300,000 mu of spring-sown land. Before the summer harvest and planting, the county's Party and government organizations at all levels led agricultural cooperatives in launching a large-scale debate on deep plowing and the issue of how plowing guarantees increased autumn production; at the same time, they rationally arranged labor, established 2,241 plowing groups, and implemented a system of ensuring quality, quantity, and time, taking responsibility to the end, ensuring the specifications and quality of plowing.

In order to overcome the shortage of tools for deep plowing, iron and woodworking workers in various places rushed to produce and modify more than 31,990 double-layered double-share plows, basically achieving the goal of each production team having a deep-plowing plow.

As soon as the summer harvest and planting began, a mass movement of comparing drive, comparing measures, comparing efficiency, and comparing quality in deep plowing land quickly unfolded throughout the county. Many agricultural cooperatives braved the rain and fought through the night, achieving simultaneous harvesting, fertilization, and deep plowing. The vast majority of the land that has already been deep-plowed has been sown in a timely manner.

With the development of the deep plowing movement, new developments have also emerged in deep plowing methods. From the plowing situation of various agricultural cooperatives, there are basically four types: First, front plow and rear set. Using four animals and two people, the front plough uses a 7-inch plough, and the back plough uses a heavy plow with only a plowshare and no moldboard. Each day it can plow four mu, with a depth of 1.2 chi. The second is to use the Zengfumiao Township double-layered double-share deep plowing plow to plow the land. One person and two animals can deep plow three mu per day. The advantage is that it is faster than manual plowing, deeper (1.2 chi of pure soil, 1.5 chi with plow ridge), and more thorough, with no unmixed soil. The third is front plow and rear excavation. The front is plowed with a 7-inch plow, and the back is excavated with a grab hook. Plowing and fertilizing are carried out simultaneously. Each furrow is separated by 8 inches, and when plowing the second furrow, the topsoil is turned into the first furrow. Two animals and nine people (including fertilization) can plow five to six mu per day, with a depth of between 1 chi and 1.2 chi. The advantage is that it is deeply plowed, plowed at intervals, and has high efficiency, which can increase efficiency by 30% compared to general deep plowing. The fourth is medium-deep and two shallow staggered plowing. The method is to use a double-layered double-share deep plowing plow in the middle, apply fertilizer after plowing, and use a 7-inch plow to shallow plow on both sides, turning the topsoil on both sides to the deep-plowed area in the middle to seal it into a ridge. Four people and four animals can plow five to six mu per day, with a depth of 1.2 chi in the middle and 7 inches on both sides. The advantage is that it is suitable for ridge planting of crops, and is suitable for wide-ridge crops such as corn, tobacco, and sweet potatoes. It is twice as fast as manual general plowing, solving the contradiction of insufficient labor and animal power.

### 夏收夏种期间掀起深翻地运动  长葛翻地十一万多亩深度超过一尺二寸

    夏收夏种期间掀起深翻地运动
    长葛翻地十一万多亩深度超过一尺二寸
    新华社郑州10日电　以深翻土地闻名全国的河南省长葛县农民，在紧张的夏收夏种期间（自5月30日到6月6日）又深翻了十一万七千多亩土地，深度都在一尺二寸以上。今年，这个县五十万亩夏播农田，都要在播种前普遍进行一次土地大翻身，为秋季作物更大丰收创造条件。
    长葛县在今年春耕中，曾把全县三十多万亩春播土地普遍进行了深翻。到夏收夏种以前，这个县的各级党政组织，又领导农业社展开深翻土地和翻地对保证秋季增产等问题的大辩论；同时合理地安排劳力，建立了二千二百四十一个翻地组，实行包质、包量、包时间，负责到底，保证翻地的规格和质量。
    为了克服深翻地的工具不足困难，各地铁木业工人赶造和改制了三万一千九百九十多部双层双铧犁，基本上达到每个生产队都有深翻犁。
    夏收夏种刚开始，一个群众性的比干劲、比措施、比效率、比质量的深翻土地运动，就在全县迅速展开了。不少农业社冒雨挑灯夜战，作到了边收割、边施肥、边深翻。已经深翻过的土地，绝大部分都进行了适时播种。
    随着深翻土地运动的发展，深翻地的方法也有了新的发展。从各农业社犁地情况来看，基本上有四种：一是前犁后套。用四头牲口、两个人，前边七寸步犁犁，后面光犁铧不带犁面的笨犁犁，每天能犁四亩，深度一尺二寸。二是用增福庙乡双层双铧深翻犁犁地，一个人、两头牲口，每天可深翻三亩，优点是比人工翻的快，犁的深（净土一尺二寸，带犁垈一尺五寸），翻的透，没有夹生现象。三是前犁后掘。前边用七寸步犁犁，后边用抓钩掘，边犁、边施肥，每犁隔八寸，犁第二犁时将熟土翻入第一犁沟内。两个牲口、九个人（连施肥），每天可犁五亩到六亩，深度在一尺到一尺二寸之间，好处是翻的深，隔垅翻，效率高，比普遍深翻可提高效率30％。四是中深两浅隔格翻。方法是中间用双层双铧深翻犁犁，犁后施肥，两边用七寸步犁浅犁，将两边熟土翻到中间深犁处封成脊，四个人、四头牲口，每天能犁五亩到六亩，中间深度一尺二寸，两边深七寸，好处是适合作物埂栽，适应玉米、烟叶、红芋等宽垅作物，比人力普遍翻地快两倍，解决劳畜力不足的矛盾。
