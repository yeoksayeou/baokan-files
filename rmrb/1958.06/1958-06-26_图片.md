Recently, a private industrial middle school was opened in Zhanjiaxi, Chongqing. This school has adopted a work-study program. Students study in the morning and participate in labor at the Jialing Machine Factory in the afternoon, using the income from their labor as school funding. This method of running the school is very popular with students' parents. This is a picture of the students studying drafting together.
