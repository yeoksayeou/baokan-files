Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 18th: The 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party solemnly opened at 9:00 AM today in the famous Julius Fučík Park Congress Hall in Prague.

This congress is being held four years after the 10th Congress of the CCP, under the grand slogan of "Completing Socialist Construction." The venue was decorated solemnly and simply, with a serious yet enthusiastic atmosphere. A banner reading "Completing Socialist Construction" was hung on the rostrum.

Over a thousand delegates and representatives from fifty-six fraternal parties attended today's opening ceremony. When the CCP leaders, headed by Comrade Novotný, as well as the heads and members of fraternal communist and workers' party delegations, including Kirichenko and Dong Biwu, walked towards the rostrum, prolonged and enthusiastic applause erupted, along with cheers of "Long Live Peace!", "Long Live the Czechoslovak Communist Party!", and "Long Live the Soviet Union!". This fully demonstrated the delegates' heartfelt love for the party leaders and the strong unity of socialist countries and the international workers' movement.

Comrade Široký, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, delivered the opening speech. He reviewed the glorious path traversed by the CCP and the Czechoslovak people and analyzed the current situation. He said that this congress is being held under the banner of the great task of "Completing Socialist Construction." The main task of this congress is to assess the achievements in realizing the general line of building socialism as stipulated by the 9th Congress of the CCP and to determine the future direction for completing the cause of socialist construction. At his proposal, the entire assembly stood in silent tribute to the party leaders, including Zápotocký, who passed away during the period between the two congresses, as well as the outstanding representatives of the international workers' movement, such as Bierut and Gheorghiu-Dej.

Široký announced a welcome to the representatives of communist and workers' parties from various countries to attend the congress, and the atmosphere at the venue reached a climax. The names of the delegations from the Soviet Union, China, France, Algeria, Indonesia, and other countries received the most enthusiastic applause. When welcoming the CPSU delegation, Novotný and Kirichenko tightly clasped their raised hands together.

Comrade Široký, in his opening speech, referred to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and the recent Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party as proof of loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and loyalty to the ideas of proletarian internationalism. He said that, on the other hand, the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia openly opposed the Moscow Declaration of November of last year and adopted a program that absolutely violates Marxism-Leninism. Široký recounted the enormous efforts made by communist and workers' parties to eliminate the mistakes of 1949 and subsequent years and to help the League of Communists of Yugoslavia adopt a Marxist position. He said, however, that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have been continuously spreading their revisionist views.

He said that because the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are now launching an attack on the common interests of the entire international communist movement, we and all other communist and workers' parties believe we have the right and the responsibility to expose such a program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that betrays Marxism-Leninism. He added that all revisionist attacks on Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the unity of the socialist camp are doomed to failure, and the international working-class movement will further strengthen its ideological and political unity.

Široký finally formally announced the opening of the 11th Congress of the CCP.

Subsequently, the assembly sang "The Internationale." The congress unanimously adopted the agenda and elected the presidium and various committees. The main items on the agenda of the congress are: the report on the work of the Central Committee of the CCP and the current main tasks, to be delivered by Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CCP; the work report of the Central Auditing Commission of the CCP, to be delivered by Šťítka, Chairman of the Central Auditing Commission of the CCP; the election of the Central Committee of the CCP; and the election of the Central Auditing Commission of the CCP. Then, amid warm applause, Novotný began to deliver his report to the congress on the work of the Central Committee of the CCP and the current main tasks.

The morning session ended after Novotný delivered his report, and the delegates discussed the report in the afternoon.

    捷共第十一次代表大会隆重开幕
    西罗基致开幕词综述捷共的光荣道路
    五十六个兄弟党的代表团和代表应邀参加大会
    新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会今天上午九时在布拉格著名的伏契克公园国会大厦隆重开幕。
    这次代表大会是在捷共第十次代表大会召开四年之后、在“完成社会主义建设”的雄壮口号下举行的。会场布置庄严朴素，气氛严肃而热烈。主席台上悬挂着“完成社会主义建设”的横幅。
    一千多名代表和五十六个兄弟党的代表团和代表参加了今天的开幕式。当以诺沃提尼同志为首的捷共领导人以及基里钦科、董必武等兄弟共产党和工人党代表团团长和团员走向主席台时，爆发了长时间的热烈鼓掌和“和平万岁！”、“捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁！”、“苏联万岁！”的欢呼声。这充分显示了代表们对党的领导人的衷心爱戴，也显示出社会主义阵营各国和国际工人运动的坚强团结。
    捷共中央政治局委员西罗基同志致开幕词。他综述了捷共和捷克斯洛伐克人民所走过的光荣道路，分析了当前的形势。他说，这次代表大会是在“完成社会主义建设”的伟大任务的标志下举行的。这次代表大会的主要任务是估计在实现捷共第九次代表大会所规定的建设社会主义总路线方面的成就和规定今后完成社会主义建设事业的方针。在他提议下，全场起立为在两次代表大会期间逝世的萨波托斯基等党的领导人和国际工人运动的杰出代表贝鲁特、加香等默哀。
    西罗基宣布欢迎各国共产党和工人党代表参加大会时，会场气氛达到了高潮。苏联、中国、法国、阿尔及利亚、印度尼西亚等代表团的名字得到最为热烈的掌声。在欢迎苏共代表团时，诺沃提尼和基里钦科两只高举的手紧紧地握在一起。
    西罗基同志在他的开幕词中称中国共产党第八届代表大会第二次会议和最近举行的保加利亚共产党代表大会是忠于马克思列宁主义和忠于无产阶级国际主义思想的证明。他说，另一方面，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会公开反对去年11月的莫斯科宣言，并且通过了绝对违背马克思列宁主义的纲领。西罗基追述了共产党和工人党为消除1949年和以后几年的错误和为帮助南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟采取马克思主义立场而作的巨大努力，他说，但是，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人一直在继续散布他们的修正主义观点。
    他说，由于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导现在向整个国际共产主义运动的共同利益发动进攻，我们和其他所有共产党和工人党认为我们有权利和责任揭露南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟这样一个背叛马克思列宁主义的纲领。他又说，对马克思列宁主义学说和社会主义阵营的团结进行的一切修正主义的攻击都是注定要失败的，国际工人阶级运动将进一步加强它的思想上和政治上的团结。
    西罗基最后正式宣布捷共第十一次代表大会开幕。
    随后，大会高唱“国际歌”。大会一致通过了大会议程，选举出大会主席团和各种委员会。大会主要议程有：捷共中央委员会工作和目前主要任务的报告，报告人是捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼；捷共中央检查委员会工作报告，报告人是捷共中央检查委员会主席什蒂特卡；选举捷共中央委员会；选举捷共中央检查委员会。接着，诺沃提尼在热烈掌声中开始向大会作捷共中央委员会工作和目前主要任务的报告。
    上午会议在诺沃提尼作了报告后结束，下午代表们就这个报告进行讨论。
