Explanation on the Draft of the Agricultural Tax Regulations of the People's Republic of China
Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance of the People's Republic of China

　　After the basic completion of agricultural cooperation in the country, the relations of production in rural areas have undergone fundamental changes. The "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in 1950, although some revisions were made after 1952 based on the reform of the land system, the development of agricultural production, and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, these regulations were still based on the individual economy and were no longer compatible with the new production relations after agricultural cooperation. Similarly, the agricultural tax collection methods in the old liberated areas were generally formulated before 1952, and they are no longer applicable now. Since 1956, we have started drafting new agricultural tax regulations. Over the past two years, we have solicited opinions from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and central departments, held professional meetings for discussion and revision many times, and passed them through the 71st plenary meeting of the State Council. Now, this draft regulation is submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.
　　What are the main contents of the new Agricultural Tax Regulations (Draft)? What is the burden on farmers after the implementation of these regulations? How will the adjustment of normal annual output and tax rates be carried out? Now, I will explain these issues as follows.

　　Main Contents of the New Agricultural Tax Regulations

　　First, let's talk about the main contents of the new Agricultural Tax Regulations (Draft).
　　The new Agricultural Tax Regulations (Draft) are formulated based on the principles of promoting the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and in accordance with the policy of combining unified leadership with adapting to local conditions, and the spirit of simplifying the taxation system as much as possible. On the one hand, we have made several important changes to the original agricultural tax system based on the rural economic situation after agricultural cooperation; on the other hand, we have summarized past experiences and retained some of the effective provisions in the original collection methods that are still applicable in the future.
　　Compared with the current agricultural tax collection methods, the new Agricultural Tax Regulations (Draft) have the following important changes:

　　Regarding the issue of tax-paying units. Before agricultural cooperation, the method of paying agricultural tax based on individual households was implemented, which was suitable for the situation of the individual economy. After agricultural cooperation, the land and other main means of production of farmers have been transformed into collective ownership, production is uniformly managed by the cooperatives, and income is also uniformly distributed by the cooperatives. Adopting the method of paying agricultural tax based on individual households is no longer compatible with this new production relationship. In fact, all advanced cooperatives now pay agricultural tax on a cooperative basis. Most of the elementary cooperatives also pay taxes on a cooperative basis, and only a small part still pays taxes on a household basis. However, the production and distribution of these cooperatives are also carried out on a cooperative basis. The method of paying taxes on a household basis is no longer meaningful, only increases administrative trouble, and is not conducive to strengthening the collective concept of cooperative members. Therefore, Article 5 of the draft stipulates that agricultural production cooperatives shall pay agricultural tax on a cooperative basis. After the original elementary cooperatives that paid taxes on a household basis are changed to paying taxes on a cooperative basis, land remuneration should be reduced accordingly in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Model Charter of Elementary Agricultural Production Cooperatives.

　　Regarding the unified implementation of the proportional tax system. The current situation is: the later liberated areas implement the progressive tax system, and the earlier liberated areas implement the proportional tax system. Article 2 of the draft stipulates that a proportional tax system shall be implemented uniformly throughout the country. This is a major reform. Before agricultural cooperation, the use of a progressive tax system in the later liberated areas could not only reflect a reasonable burden policy, but also help to limit the development of the rich peasant economy and regulate the income of various strata of residents in rural areas. But at present, the rich peasant economy has been eliminated, and the individual agricultural economy has basically been transformed into a collective agricultural economy. Under this circumstance, it is no longer necessary to continue to implement a progressive tax system. In the old liberated areas, although a proportional tax system has been implemented in the past, some regions deduct a certain amount of tax-free quota according to the population of each household, while others do not deduct the tax-free quota. The method of deducting the tax-free quota makes households with more land, more income, and fewer people bear more burden, while households with less land, less income, and more people bear less burden. It has a certain regulatory effect on the income of various strata of residents in rural areas. After agricultural cooperation, this method is no longer necessary. Therefore, Article 2 of the draft stipulates that a proportional tax system shall be implemented uniformly throughout the country, and the provision of deducting tax-free quota according to population is cancelled. This change in the agricultural tax system can adapt to the economic situation after agricultural cooperation, further encourage farmers to develop production, and simplify the current relatively complex tax system.

　　Regarding how individual farmers pay taxes. Article 13 of the draft stipulates: The agricultural tax that individual farmers should pay shall be calculated at the same tax rate as the agricultural production cooperatives in the area, and an additional tax of 10% to 50% shall be levied separately according to different economic conditions. This is because: (1) Most of the current small number of individual farmers are well-to-do middle peasants. In areas where the progressive tax system was originally implemented, the tax rate was relatively high because these well-to-do middle peasants owned a relatively large amount of land per capita. After changing to a proportional tax system, if the tax is levied at the same tax rate as the local agricultural production cooperatives, their burden will generally be lighter than before, and some will be much lighter. Therefore, taking the method of levying additional tax on the agricultural tax payable by individual farmers so that their burden is not lighter than in the past is beneficial to the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives and the transformation of individual farmers. (2) The income distribution situation of individual farmers and agricultural production cooperatives is also different. In addition to paying agricultural tax to the state, agricultural production cooperatives also have to deduct public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and cooperative management fees from their total income. Public accumulation funds are used to expand reproduction, and public welfare funds are used to implement "Five Guarantees" and handle other rural social welfare undertakings. The public welfare funds deducted by agricultural production cooperatives from their total income across the country are a considerable figure. Taking 1957 as an example, it is roughly equivalent to about 10% of the national agricultural tax collection amount (regular tax and surcharges) in the same year. Although individual farmers also need to have a certain amount of accumulation to expand reproduction, they do not bear the public welfare funds spent on handling the "Five Guarantees" and other social welfare undertakings. Therefore, it is reasonable and necessary to levy a portion of additional tax on individual farmers in terms of agricultural tax. Of course, for some households among individual farmers who lack labor force and have difficulties in life, additional tax should not be levied. This has been stipulated in the draft regulations. On the issue of tax payment by individual farmers, some comrades also advocate still adopting a progressive tax system for individual farmers. We believe that the number of individual farmers is currently very small, and in order to simplify the tax system, it is not necessary to formulate another set of progressive tax rates. Taking the method of levying additional tax can not only achieve the purpose of restricting the spontaneous forces of rural capitalism and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, but also the specific percentage of additional tax stipulated by the local people's committees is more flexible and can better meet the actual conditions of various regions than the method of uniformly stipulating progressive tax rates.

　　Regarding the unification and adaptation to local conditions of agricultural tax rates. The original agricultural tax rates in various regions were stipulated by the former Government Council or approved by the administrative committees of the greater administrative areas after reporting to the former Government Council. In the past, emphasis was placed on unifying agricultural tax rates. Practice has proved that it is not feasible to implement a uniform tax rate throughout the country due to China's vast territory, complex conditions, and uneven economic development in various regions, as well as differences in historical burden bases. Therefore, the result of implementing it for several years is that some provinces jointly implement one tax rate, some provinces implement one tax rate, and some provinces implement several tax rates. At present, there are more than 30 tax rates combined nationwide, but they still cannot adapt well to the different economic conditions of various regions. In order to further implement the policy of combining unified leadership with adapting to local conditions, the draft regulations stipulate that the national average tax rate is 15.5% of the normal annual output (normal annual output is the taxable output, which remains unchanged within a certain period of time after one assessment. This output is lower than the actual output, so the actual burden ratio of farmers is lower than the agricultural tax rate. This will be explained later). The tax rates in various regions are either lower than this average tax rate or higher than this average tax rate, but the highest shall not exceed 25% of the normal annual output. Within this range, the average tax rates of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government shall be stipulated by the State Council; the tax rates below the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government shall be stipulated separately by the provincial, county, or autonomous prefecture people's committees based on the average tax rate stipulated by the higher authorities and according to the different economic conditions of each region under their jurisdiction. This approach is more flexible than in the past and can make the tax rates more realistic. The average tax rates of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government are authorized to be stipulated separately by the State Council instead of being stipulated separately in the regulations. This is because, according to past experience, after the tax rates are determined, necessary adjustments will still be made between regions based on the development of production and under the principle that the overall burden level remains unchanged. Therefore, it is more flexible for the average tax rates of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government to be stipulated separately by the State Council than to be stipulated in the regulations. As for the highest tax rate, it was stipulated as 30% in areas where the progressive tax system was implemented in the past, mainly to restrict the development of the rich peasant economy. After agricultural cooperation, the rich peasant economy has been eliminated, and it is no longer necessary to retain such a high tax rate for agricultural production cooperatives. But it is also not appropriate to be lower than 25%, because in some wealthy areas, farmers have more income and the original average tax rate is high. Even after they pay taxes, their lives are still relatively wealthy. If the tax rates in these areas are reduced too much, the burden on wealthy areas will be reduced, affecting the completion of agricultural tax collection tasks, or the burden on other areas will be increased, which is not appropriate.

　　Regarding the agricultural tax issue in economic crop areas. In the past, it was stipulated that economic crops should be assessed based on the normal annual output of grain crops planted on the same land; the tax rates of economic crops and grain crops were the same, and the surcharge ratio was also the same. However, because the income from planting economic crops is greater than the income from planting grain crops, the actual agricultural tax burden ratio of economic crops (the percentage of regular tax and surcharges combined to the actual output) is lower than the burden ratio of grain crops. From the national average estimate, in 1952, the burden ratio of grain crops was 14.2%, and the burden ratio of economic crops was 8.3%; in 1957, the burden ratio of grain crops was 12.2%, and the burden ratio of economic crops was only 6.4%. This has played a good role in encouraging farmers to actively develop the production of economic crops and ensuring the supply of raw materials for light industry. However, with the rapid development of economic crop production, the phenomenon of imbalance in the burden between economic crops and grain crops has been expanding, making farmers in grain crop areas feel that the agricultural tax burden is not reasonable enough. Therefore, Article 6 of the draft stipulates: "The income from planting cotton, hemp, tobacco leaves, oil crops, and sugar crops shall be calculated with reference to the normal annual output of grain crops," and it is no longer mandatory to calculate it according to the normal annual output of grain crops planted on the same land. In this way, local authorities can assess the normal annual output of various economic crops separately with reference to the size of the profits obtained. For economic crops with higher profits, the normal annual output can be set slightly higher than that of grain fields. Even after this increase, it will still be lower than the actual output of the economic crops themselves. Article 40 of the draft also stipulates that in areas where the planting of economic crops and horticultural crops is relatively concentrated and the profits exceed those of grain crops by a large margin, the local surcharge ratio may be higher than 15% of the regular tax, but the highest shall not exceed 30%. These provisions will allow for a more reasonable adjustment of the burden between economic crops and grain crops. Of course, when adjusting the burden ratio between economic crops and grain crops, all localities must also pay attention to the state's requirements for developing various economic crops. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, various economic crops are required to develop more and faster than in the First Five-Year Plan period. Therefore, it must be ensured that the burden ratio of economic crops is still lower than that of grain crops after the adjustment, and the profits are still greater than those of grain crops, so as to continue to encourage farmers to increase the production of economic crops. As for areas where economic crops are planted sporadically, areas where the planting of economic crops is relatively concentrated but the profits do not exceed or only slightly exceed those of grain fields, and areas where economic crops have just begun to develop, the normal annual output should still be assessed with reference to the equivalent grain fields, and the surcharge ratio should not be increased. In addition, Article 16 of the draft also stipulates that "taxpayers who newly reclaim or newly restore mulberry gardens, tea gardens, orchards, and other economic trees on mountain land shall be exempt from agricultural tax for three to seven years from the year of income." This can better encourage farmers to develop production and construction in mountainous areas.

　　The above are several important changes to the agricultural tax regulations. In addition, many of the original effective provisions, especially those that are conducive to the development of agricultural production, have been retained in the new agricultural tax regulations. For example, agricultural income is still calculated based on normal annual output, not actual output. This not only encourages farmers to actively increase production, but also is relatively simple and easy to implement, avoiding the trouble of assessing output every year. When assessing normal annual output, Article 8 of the draft stipulates that for land that has increased the unit area yield due to the construction of farmland water conservancy projects or soil and water conservation projects, the normal annual output shall be assessed with reference to the output of normal years before the benefit for less than three years. Article 9 of the draft also stipulates: "After the normal annual output is assessed, the normal annual output shall not be increased within five years due to diligent cultivation and improved management; the normal annual output shall not be reduced due to negligent cultivation and reduced unit area yield." These provisions have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in many years of practice and have been supported by the broad masses of farmers. Obviously, in the future, it will continue to play a good role in promoting the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program. For example, various preferential treatments in the original tax collection methods that are conducive to the development of agricultural production, such as rewards for reclaiming wasteland, rewards for planting economic trees on mountains, and rewards for agricultural scientific experiments, as well as the original care for ethnic minority areas, old revolutionary base areas, and barren mountainous areas, and the reduction and exemption for taxpayers who have difficulties in paying taxes due to natural disasters, lack of labor force, or other reasons, have all been retained. These provisions are of great importance for developing agricultural production, strengthening national unity, and helping poor farmers solve production and life difficulties.

　　Farmers' Burden After Implementation of the New Agricultural Tax Regulations

　　Now, let's talk about the issue of farmers' burden after the implementation of the new Agricultural Tax Regulations.
　　How much burden farmers bear is the fundamental issue of agricultural tax and also the issue of the distribution relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. Whether this issue is handled correctly is related to the speed of socialist construction and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

　　During the First Five-Year Plan period, we not only implemented the policy proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to stabilize the agricultural tax collection target at the level collected in 1952 for three years without change in the first three years; but in the actual implementation results, the farmers' burden was basically stable in the following two years. That is to say, the farmers' burden has been basically stable for five years since 1953. The agricultural tax collection amount (including regular tax and local surcharges) in each year from 1953 to 1956 did not exceed the level of 38.8 billion catties of fine grain actually collected in 1952 (fine grain refers to rice, millet, wheat, and sorghum rice. Various grains and economic crops collected for agricultural tax are converted into fine grain for calculation, and the normal annual output for calculating and levying agricultural tax is also the conversion of various grains and economic crops into fine grain). The agricultural tax burden in 1957 increased by about 600 million catties compared with 1952, but what increased was the local surcharge, and this increased part was mainly used to host local production construction and public welfare undertakings. The ratio of agricultural tax collection amount to actual agricultural output has gradually decreased from 13.2% in 1952 to 11.3% in 1957 due to the development of agricultural production. In other words, although the agricultural tax rate remains unchanged, the actual burden ratio of farmers is gradually decreasing. This has greatly encouraged farmers to develop production, and the lives of farmers have gradually improved, which has played a good role in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Practice has proved that the policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on stabilizing the farmers' burden is completely correct.

　　Under the inspiration of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and the slogan of catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom in fifteen years or in a shorter period of time, a great leap forward situation has emerged on the agricultural front since last winter. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, agricultural production in our country will have high-speed development. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of more than 500 million farmers and realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, in terms of farmers' burden, according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we plan to continue to adopt the policy of increasing production without increasing taxes after the burden has increased slightly and some reasonable adjustments have been made between regions. The agricultural tax regulations (draft) now proposed are formulated in accordance with this policy.

　　According to the above policy, we plan to collect 36.2 billion catties of regular tax in 1958, plus local surcharges totaling 41.2 billion catties. This figure is an increase of 1.8 billion catties, or 4.6%, compared to the 39.4 billion catties collected in 1957. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the agricultural tax collection amount for each year will basically be stable at the level of the 1958 collection amount and will not be increased. According to the current great leap forward situation in agricultural production, if agricultural production increases by an average of 10% per year during the Second Five-Year Plan period, then it will increase by more than 60% by 1962 compared with 1957. Because the agricultural tax collection amount basically remains unchanged, the ratio of agricultural tax to actual output will gradually decrease from 11.3% in 1957 to about 7% in 1962. In addition, farmers have to pay a small portion of other taxes in addition to agricultural tax; farmers' income also includes sideline income in addition to agricultural income. If we add the other taxes paid by farmers in terms of the farmer's burden and add the value of sideline production in terms of the farmer's income, then the ratio of the total farmer's burden to the total output value of agriculture and sideline production will also gradually decrease from 6.1% in 1957 to about 4% in 1962. Under the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, why continue to adopt the policy of stabilizing the farmers' burden instead of collecting a little more agricultural tax? Will this affect the accumulation of national construction funds and the speed of socialist construction? Our answer is no. On the contrary, this is precisely to accelerate the speed of socialist construction. Because after the agricultural tax burden is stabilized, a large part of the increased agricultural production will be used to increase the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives, so as to rely on the cooperatives' own financial and material resources, under the leadership of the Party and the support of the state, to go all out, aim high, and build rural socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, so as to rely on the endless strength and wisdom of the farmers across the country, work hard for three years, and accelerate the change of the rural appearance. Only in this way can we better implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, and simultaneously developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, so as to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture as soon as possible.

　　Of course, the stability of the agricultural tax burden is for the country as a whole. After the implementation of the new Agricultural Tax Regulations, if there are still significant unreasonable phenomena in the burden between regions, necessary adjustments can be made. Moreover, because some years may be bumper harvests and some years may be poor harvests in the future, necessary adjustments will also need to be made between years.

　　Adjustment of Normal Annual Output and Tax Rate Issues

　　Here, I will talk about the adjustment of normal annual output and tax rate issues.

　　The current normal annual output is generally assessed before 1952. With the development of production, the normal annual output is becoming increasingly lower than the actual output, and the distance between the agricultural tax rate stipulated by the state and the actual burden ratio of farmers is becoming increasingly larger. For example, in 1957, the national average tax rate of the regular agricultural tax was 16.5%, while the actual burden ratio of farmers was only 10% based on the regular tax portion (even with the surcharge portion, it was only 11.3%). At the same time, due to the unbalanced production development in various regions in recent years, continuing to levy taxes based on the originally determined normal annual output has also resulted in several unreasonable phenomena. In order to appropriately reduce the distance between the tax rate and the actual burden ratio of farmers, and to change some unreasonable situations between regions, the approach taken this time is: on the one hand, appropriately increase the originally determined normal annual output and make necessary adjustments based on the actual situation; on the other hand, reduce the tax rate somewhat on the basis of increasing the normal annual output. This is beneficial for balancing the burden between regions and ensuring the completion of agricultural tax collection tasks. The national average tax rate stipulated in the draft regulations is designed according to this method.

　　The current national normal annual output converted into fine grain is 240 billion catties, while the actual agricultural output in 1957 converted into fine grain is 348.1 billion catties (of which: various grains are 370 billion catties, converted into fine grain 275.8 billion catties; soybeans are 19.9 billion catties, converted into fine grain 20.2 billion catties; various economic crops are converted into fine grain 52.1 billion catties), the normal annual output is only equivalent to 69% of the actual agricultural output in 1957. After researching with provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, it is planned to increase the normal annual output to about 270 billion catties, an increase of about 12%. The increased normal annual output is only equivalent to about 78% of the actual output in 1957. Of course, the proportion of increase in the normal annual output of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should be different. At the same time, necessary adjustments need to be made to some unreasonable phenomena in the originally determined normal annual output between regions within a province. If the originally determined normal annual output of individual regions is too high, it must be appropriately reduced. If the originally determined normal annual output is too low, the increase can be larger. Is the workload of adjusting the normal annual output this time very large? We believe it is not large. Because: (1) The adjustment can be carried out by using the previously assessed normal annual output as a basis, and there is no need to carry out a new field survey to determine output like in the past. (2) After agricultural cooperation, the land is uniformly managed by the cooperatives, and the agricultural tax is uniformly paid by the cooperatives. The adjustment of the normal annual output can also take the method of proportionally increasing it by township or by cooperative, and there is no need to assess it plot by plot like in the past. (3) The actual output of the agricultural production cooperatives has records in the account books, and there is no need to spend a lot of time conducting investigations and evaluations like in the past. These are all favorable conditions for carrying out this work. People's committees at all levels can make full use of these favorable conditions and adopt simple and effective methods to carry out the work. For example, the county people's committee can designate some cadres to do research on the normal annual output in conjunction with other rural work, propose adjustment plans after trial calculations, and then convene meetings of township and cooperative cadres to discuss and pass them. With such an approach, the effort and time spent will not be too much.

　　Since the increased normal annual output is only equivalent to about 78% of the actual output in 1957, can the normal annual output be increased a little more, thereby reducing the tax rate a little more? After repeated research with comrades in various places, everyone believes that this is not appropriate. Because: (1) Preferential treatment needs to be given to those who increase the unit area yield by building farmland water conservancy, and the normal annual output cannot be increased to the level of the actual output. In order to encourage increased production, the normal annual output of advanced production units and regions should not be increased too much. (2) The normal annual output of economic crops is not assessed according to the output of economic crops, but with reference to the output of grain crops. Although the normal annual output of economic crops with higher profits can be set slightly higher than that of grain fields, it is still much lower than the actual output of the economic crops themselves. (3) The actual agricultural output includes a portion of tax-free output (such as the output of newly reclaimed wasteland, etc.), and this portion of output cannot be included in the taxable normal annual output. (4) According to the current situation, the larger the distance between the original normal annual output and the actual output, the more it is mainly in the poorer areas, while the higher the original tax rate, the more it is mainly in the richer areas. If the normal annual output is increased too much and the tax rate is reduced, the burden on the poorer areas will be increased and the burden on the richer areas will be reduced.

　　The draft regulations stipulate that the national average tax rate is 15.5%, which is about 1% lower compared with the national average tax rate of 16.5% in 1957. This reduction ratio is an average figure, and it is not consistent for each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government. The average tax rates of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government formulated by the State Council are either reduced more, not reduced, or slightly increased in a few areas. This is because most areas still use the tax rates stipulated before 1952, and there are already some unreasonable phenomena in the farmers' burden between regions. In addition, the unbalanced production development in various regions in recent years has also produced some new unreasonable phenomena. Therefore, when we formulated the tax rates this time, we made appropriate adjustments to the average tax rates of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government, which is necessary.

　　Because the average land area per farmer varies from region to region, and the unit area yield varies from high to low, the average tax rates in each region are still high or low after adjustment. However, if we look at the surplus grain per farmer after collecting agricultural tax, it is more reasonable. For example, the average tax rates in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are 2.5%-3.5% higher than the national average tax rate, and the surplus grain after paying agricultural tax, taking 1957 as an example, averages as high as 730 catties to 1,500 catties per person, exceeding the national average of about 580 catties. This situation shows that it is appropriate for the average tax rates in these three provinces to be slightly higher. After this adjustment of the average tax rates in each region, the farmers' burden will be more balanced and reasonable than in the past. However, this balance and rationality can only be relative and temporary. After the great leap forward in agricultural production, new imbalances will appear in various regions across the country, and these new imbalances need to be continuously adjusted after a period of time.

　　Finally, I would also like to explain that this draft fully embodies the flexibility of adapting to local conditions under the unified principles and policies. On the one hand, unified provisions have been made in the draft for major policy issues that must be unified. On the other hand, due to China's vast territory, complex conditions, and unbalanced economic development in various regions, it is also completely necessary to give local people's committees greater discretionary power, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the local governments under the unified leadership of the central government, so that the implementation of the agricultural tax regulations can better adapt to the different conditions of various regions. Therefore, many clauses in this draft have made flexible provisions. For example, the agricultural tax rates in various places, the specific percentage of additional tax levied on individual farmers, the ratio of local surcharges, the calculation standards of certain agricultural income, the preferential treatment methods related to rewarding production, and the tax reduction and exemption methods for taking care of disaster areas, etc., are all authorized to be specifically stipulated by the local people's committees within the scope stipulated in the draft regulations. Issues that are temporary, regional, and related to implementation are all authorized to be stipulated by the local governments. All these provisions are necessary and in line with the actual situation in rural China.

　　The above is the explanation on the new Agricultural Tax Regulations (Draft), please submit it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

　　关于中华人民共和国农业税条例（草案）的说明
　　中华人民共和国财政部副部长　吴波
    全国农业合作化基本完成以后，农村的生产关系起了根本的变化。1950年中央人民政府颁布的“新解放区农业税暂行条例”，在1952年以后，虽然根据土地制度的改革、农业生产的发展和互助合作运动的开展等情况，作了一些修改，但这个条例仍然是以个体经济为基础的，和农业合作化以后新的生产关系已经不相适应了。同样的，各个老解放区的农业税征收办法，一般也是在1952年以前制定的，现在也已经不适用了。从1956年起，我们就开始起草新的农业税条例。两年来曾先后向各省、自治区、直辖市和中央各部门征求了意见，多次召开专业会议进行了讨论和修改，并且经过国务院第七十一次全体会议讨论通过。现在把这个条例草案提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。
    新的农业税条例（草案）的主要内容是什么呢？实行这个条例以后农民负担的情况怎样呢？调整常年产量和调整税率的工作如何进行呢？现在，就这些问题作如下说明。
    新农业税条例的主要内容
    首先说新的农业税条例（草案）的主要内容。
    新的农业税条例（草案）是本着促进农业生产的发展和农业生产合作社的巩固，兼顾国家、集体和个人利益的原则，并且根据统一领导同因地制宜相结合的方针，和尽量简化征税制度的精神来拟定的。我们一方面从农业合作化以后的农村经济情况出发，对原来的农业税收制度作了若干重要的改变；另一方面总结了过去的经验，把原来征收办法中行之有效而且今后仍然适用的一些规定都保留下来。
    新的农业税条例（草案）同现行的农业税征收办法相比较，有以下的重要改变：
    关于纳税单位问题。在农业合作化以前，实行以农户为单位交纳农业税的办法，这是适合于个体经济的情况的。农业合作化以后，农民的土地和其他主要生产资料已经转变为集体所有，生产由合作社统一经营，收入也由合作社统一分配了，再采用以农户为单位交纳农业税的办法，就不能和这种新的生产关系相适应了。事实上，现在所有的高级社都已经以社为单位交纳农业税了。初级社中也大部分已经以社为单位纳税，只有一小部分仍然以农户为单位纳税。但是，这些社的生产和分配也是以社为单位进行的，以农户为单位纳税的办法已经没有意义，徒然增加事务上的麻烦，并且也不利于加强社员的集体观念。因此，草案第五条规定农业生产合作社一律以社为单位交纳农业税。原来以农户为单位纳税的初级社，改为以社为单位纳税以后，应当根据初级农业生产合作社示范章程第十九条的规定，相应地减少土地报酬。
    关于统一实行比例税制问题。目前的情况是：解放较晚的地区实行累进税制，解放较早的地区实行比例税制。草案第二条规定，全国一律实行比例税制。这是一个重大的改革。在农业合作化以前，晚解放区采用累进税制，这不仅能够体现合理负担政策，而且也有利于限制富农经济的发展和调节农村各阶层居民的收入。但是目前富农经济已经消灭，个体的农业经济已经基本上转变为集体的农业经济。在这种情况下，已经没有必要继续实行累进税制了。在老解放区，过去虽然都实行比例税制，但有的地区还按各户的人口扣除一定数量的免税额，有的地区则不扣除免税额。扣除免税额的办法，使土地多、收入多、人口少的农户负担多、土地少、收入少、人口多的农户负担少，它对农村各阶层居民收入起着一定的调节作用。在农业合作化以后，这种办法也没有继续实行的必要了。因此，草案第二条规定，全国一律实行比例税制，并且取消了按人口扣除免税额的规定。农业税制的这种改变，可以适应农业合作化以后的经济情况，可以进一步鼓励农民发展生产，并且可以把目前比较复杂的税制加以简化。
    关于个体农民如何纳税问题。草案第十三条规定：个体农民应当交纳的农业税，除了与所在地区的农业生产合作社按照同一税率计算以外，根据不同的经济情况，另行加征税额的一成到五成。这是因为：（1）目前已经为数不多的个体农民，大部分是富裕中农。在原来实行累进税制的地区，由于这些富裕中农每人平均占有土地的数量比较多，因而税率也比较高。改行比例税制以后，如果和当地农业生产合作社按照同一税率计征，他们的负担一般都会比以前减轻，有的会减轻很多。因此，对个体农民应纳的农业税采取加征的办法，使他们的负担不至于比过去减轻，这对于农业生产合作社的巩固和个体农民的改造都是有利的。（2）个体农民和农业生产合作社收入的分配情况也有所不同。农业生产合作社除了向国家交纳农业税以外，还要从总收入中扣除公积金、公益金和社务管理费等项支出。公积金是用于扩大再生产的，公益金是用来实行“五保”和办理农村其它社会福利事业的。全国农业生产合作社从总收入中扣除的公益金，是一个不小的数字。以1957年为例，大约相当于同年全国农业税征收额（正税和附加）的10％左右。个体农民为了扩大再生产虽然也需要有一定的积累，但是，他们却不负担为办理“五保”和其它社会福利事业而支出的公益金。因此，在农业税方面对个体农民加征一部分，是合理的，必要的。当然，对于个体农民当中某些缺乏劳动力、生活上有困难的户，应当不予加征。这一点在条例草案中已经规定了。在个体农户的纳税问题上，也有的同志主张对个体农民仍然采用累进税制。我们认为，目前个体农民为数很少，为了简化税制，不必另订一套累进税率。采取加征的办法，不但同样可以达到限制农村资本主义自发势力和巩固农业生产合作社的目的，而且由地方人民委员会规定加征的具体成数，比统一规定累进税率的办法更为灵活，更能切合各地的实际情况。
    关于农业税税率的统一和因地制宜问题。原来各地区的农业税税率，是由前政务院规定或者由大区行政委员会规定报经前政务院批准的。过去曾一度强调过统一农业税税率。实践证明，由于我国幅员广大，情况复杂，各地的经济发展很不平衡，历史上的负担基础也有差别，要想在全国实行统一的税率是行不通的。因此，几年来执行的结果，有的几个省共同实行一种税率，有的一个省实行一种税率，还有的一个省实行几种税率。现在全国综合起来共有税率三十多种，但是还不能很好地适应各地区不同的经济情况。为了进一步贯彻统一领导同因地制宜相结合的方针，在条例草案中规定了全国的平均税率为常年产量的15.5％（常年产量即计税产量，在一次评定以后，一定时间内不变。这种产量低于实际产量，所以，农民实际负担比例要低于农业税的税率。后面再作说明）。各个地区的税率，有的低于这个平均税率，有的高于这个平均税率，但最高不得超过常年产量的25％。在这个范围内，各省、自治区、直辖市的平均税率，由国务院规定；省、自治区、直辖市以下的税率，则由省级、县级或者自治州人民委员会根据上级规定的平均税率，按照所属各地区不同的经济情况，分别加以规定。这样做法比过去更灵活了，可以使税率更加切合实际了。各省、自治区、直辖市的平均税率，授权国务院另行规定而不在条例上分别规定，这是因为根据过去的经验，税率确定以后，在执行过程中，还要根据生产发展的情况，在总的负担水平不变的原则下，在地区之间作一些必要的调整。因此，各省、自治区、直辖市的平均税率，由国务院另行规定比规定在条例上要灵活一些。至于最高税率，在过去实行累进税制的地区，规定为30％，主要是为了限制富农经济的发展。农业合作化以后，富农经济已被消灭，对于农业生产合作社已经没有必要保留那么高的税率了。但是再低于25％也不合适，因为在某些富庶地区，农民的收入较多，原来的平均税率就高，他们在纳税以后，生活仍然比较富裕，如果将这些地区的税率降低过多，就要使富庶地区的负担减少，影响农业税征收任务的完成，或者就要转而加重其他地区的负担，这是不恰当的。
    关于经济作物　地区的农业税问题。过去规定，对于经济作物都是按照同等土地种植粮食作物的常年产量来计征的；经济作物和粮食作物的税率是相同的，附加比例也是相同的。但是由于种植经济作物的收入大于种植粮食作物的收入，因此，实际上经济作物的农业税负担比例（正税和附加合计占实际产量的百分比），低于粮食作物的负担比例。从全国平均估算，1952年粮食作物的负担比例为14.2％，经济作物的负担比例为8.3％；1957年粮食作物的负担比例为12.2％，经济作物的负担比例仅为6.4％。这对于鼓励农民积极发展经济作物的生产、保证轻工业原料的供应，起了良好的作用。但是，随着经济作物生产的迅速发展，经济作物和粮食作物之间，负担不平衡的现象日益扩大，使粮食作物地区的农民感到农业税负担不够合理。因此，草案第六条规定：“种植棉花、麻类、烟叶、油料和糖料作物的收入，参照种植粮食作物的常年产量计算”，不再硬性规定按照同等土地种植粮食作物的常年产量计算。这样，地方上就可以参照各种经济作物获利的大小，分别评定它们的常年产量。对于获利较大的经济作物，可以比粮田的常年产量定得稍高一些。这样提高以后，仍然要低于经济作物本身的实际产量。草案第四十条还规定，在种植经济作物、园艺作物比较集中而获利又超过种植粮食作物较多的地区，地方附加比例，可以高于正税的15％，但最高不得超过30％。这些规定，将使经济作物和粮食作物之间的负担得到比较合理的调整。当然，各地在调整经济作物和粮食作物之间的负担比例的时候，还必须注意到国家对于发展各种经济作物的要求。在第二个五年计划期间，要求各种经济作物比第一个五年有更多更快的发展，因此，必须做到在调整以后，经济作物负担比例仍然低于粮食作物，获利仍然大于粮食作物，以便继续鼓励农民增产经济作物的积极性。至于对零星种植经济作物的地区，对种植经济作物虽然也比较集中但获利不超过粮田或者超过粮田很少的地区，以及对刚开始发展经济作物的地区，常年产量仍然应当比照同等粮田来评定，也不提高附加比例。此外，草案第十六条还规定了“纳税人在山地上新垦植或者新垦复的桑园、茶园、果园和其他经济林木，从有收入的那一年起，免征农业税三年到七年”。这就可以更好地鼓励农民去发展山区的生产建设。
    以上是农业税条例的几点重要变更。此外，许多原来的行之有效的规定，特别是有利于发展农业生产的各项规定，在新的农业税条例中都保留下来了。比如农业收入仍然按常年产量计算，不按实际产量计算。这样作，不但可以鼓励农民积极增加生产，而且比较简便易行，可以避免年年评定产量的麻烦。在评定常年产量的时候，对于兴修农田水利工程或者水土保持工程而提高单位面积产量的土地，草案第八条规定：受益未满三年的，应当参照受益前的正常年景的产量评定常年产量。草案第九条还规定：“常年产量评定以后，在五年以内，因勤劳耕作、改善经营而提高单位面积产量的，常年产量不予提高；因怠于耕作而降低单位面积产量的，常年产量不予降低”。这些规定在多年的实践中已经深入人心，得到广大农民群众的拥护。很显然，今后对于促进全国农业发展纲要的实现将要继续发生良好作用。比如原来征税办法中关于奖励开垦荒地、奖励经济林木上山、奖励农业科学试验等有利于发展农业生产的各项优待，比如原来对于少数民族地区、革命老根据地和贫瘠山区的照顾，以及对于因遭受自然灾害、缺乏劳动力或者其他原因而纳税确有困难的纳税人的减免等等，都全部保留下来了。这些规定对于发展农业生产、加强民族团结和帮助贫苦农民解决生产和生活上的困难，是有重要作用的。
    实行新农业税条例以后农民负担的情况
    下面讲一讲新的农业税条例实施以后农民负担的问题。
    农民负担多少是农业税的根本问题，也是国家、集体和个人三方面的分配关系问题。这个问题处理的正确与否，关系到社会主义建设的速度和工农联盟的巩固。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们不但在头三年贯彻执行了中共中央提出的将农业税征收指标稳定在1952年征收的水平上三年不变的方针；而且实际执行结果，以后的两年，农民负担基本上也是稳定的。这就是说，从1953年开始，农民负担已经基本上稳定了五年。1953年到1956年各年的农业税征收额（包括正税和地方附加），都没有超过1952年实际征收额三百八十八亿斤细粮的水平（细粮是指的大米、小米、小麦和高粱米。农业税征收的各种粮食和经济作物都折合细粮计算，计征农业税的常年产量，也是把各种粮食和经济作物都折合细粮计算）。1957年农业税负担比1952年增加了六亿斤左右，但是增加了的是地方附加，这个增加的部分主要是用来举办当地的生产建设和公益事业。而农业税征收额占农业实际产量的比例，则由于农业生产的发展，已经由1952年的13.2％，逐渐下降到1957年的11.3％。也就是说，尽管农业税的税率不变，农民的实际负担比例是逐渐减轻的。这就大大鼓励了农民发展生产的积极性，使农民的生活逐渐得到了改善，对巩固工农联盟起了良好的作用。实践证明，中共中央关于稳定农民负担的方针，是完全正确的。
    在中共中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和十五年或者在更短的时间内赶上和超过英国的口号的鼓舞下，从去年冬季以来，在农业战线上出现了大跃进的形势，第二个五年计划期间，我国农业生产将有高速度的发展。为了发挥五亿多农民的积极性和创造性，提前实现全国农业发展纲要，在农民负担方面，根据中共中央和毛主席的指示，我们打算在负担稍有增加并且在地区间进行某些合理调整之后，仍然采取增产不增税的方针。现在提出的农业税条例（草案），就是按照这个方针拟定的。
    根据上述方针，我们计划1958年征收正税三百六十二亿斤，加上地方附加共为四百一十二亿斤。这个数字比1957年征收额三百九十四亿斤，增加十八亿斤，即增加4.6％。第二个五年计划期间，各年的农业税征收额，即基本上稳定在1958年征收额的水平上，不予提高。根据目前农业生产大跃进的形势，按照最低的估计，在第二个五年计划期间的农业生产，如果每年平均递增10％，那么，到1962年将比1957年增长60％以上。而由于农业税征收额基本不变，农业税占实际产量的比例将由1957年的11.3％，逐渐下降到1962年的7％左右。此外，农民除了交纳农业税，还要交纳一小部分其他税款；农民的收入除了农业收入，还有副业收入。如果在农民负担方面加上他们所交纳的其他税款计算，在农民收入方面加上副业产值计算，那么，农民负担总额占农业和副业总产值的比例，也将由1957年的6.1％，逐渐下降到1962年的4％左右。在农业生产大跃进的形势下，为什么继续采取稳定农民负担的方针，而不多征收一点农业税呢？这样会不会影响国家建设资金的积累和社会主义建设的速度呢？我们的回答是不会的。而且恰恰相反，这正是为了加速社会主义建设的速度。因为，农业税负担稳定以后，农业增产部分，将有很大一部分是用来增加农业生产合作社的公共积累，以便依靠合作社自己的财力和物力，在党的领导和国家的支援之下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行农村社会主义建设，以便依靠全国农民无穷无尽的力量和智慧，苦战三年，加速改变农村的面貌。只有这样，才能很好地贯彻在重工业优先发展的条件下工业和农业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，从而尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    当然，农业税负担的稳定，这是就全国范围来说的。在新的农业税条例实施后，如果继续发现地区之间的负担有显著不合理的现象，还可以进行必要的调整。而且由于今后有的年度可能丰收，有的年度可能歉收，在年度之间也还需要进行必要的调节。
    调整常年产量和税率问题
    这里再讲一讲调整常年产量和调整税率问题。
    目前的常年产量一般是在1952年以前评定的，随着生产的发展，常年产量越来越低于实际产量，国家规定的农业税税率同农民实际负担比例之间的距离，也就越来越大。例如1957年农业税正税的税率全国平均为16.5％，而农民的实际负担比例，按正税部分计算，只有10％（加上附加部分也不过11.3％）。同时，由于几年以来各地生产发展的不平衡，继续按原定的常年产量征税，也出现若干不合理的现象。为了适当缩小税率同农民实际负担比例之间的距离，而且改变地区间若干不合理的情况，这次采取的作法是：一方面把原定的常年产量适当提高一些，并且根据实际情况作必要的调整；一方面在提高常年产量的基础上，把税率降低一些。这样作，对于平衡地区之间的负担和保证农业税征收任务的完成，都是有好处的。条例草案规定的全国平均税率就是根据这个办法设计的。
    目前全国常年产量折合细粮计算为二千四百亿斤，而1957年的农业实际产量折合细粮计算为三千四百八十一亿斤（其中：各种粮食三千七百亿斤，折合细粮二千七百五十八亿斤；大豆一百九十九亿斤，折合细粮二百零二亿斤；各种经济作物共折合细粮五百二十一亿斤），常年产量只相当于1957年农业实际产量的69％。经与各省、自治区、直辖市研究，打算把常年产量提高到二千七百亿斤左右，即提高12％左右。提高后的常年产量，也只相当于1957年实际产量的78％左右。当然，各省、自治区、直辖市常年产量提高的比例是应当有所不同的。同时，在一省之内对所属地区之间某些原定常年产量不合理的现象，也需要加以必要的调整。个别地区原定的常年产量过高的，必须适当降低。原定的常年产量过低的，提高的幅度可以大一些。这次调整常年产量的工作量，是不是很大呢？我们认为是不大的。因为：（1）可以利用过去评定的常年产量作基础来进行调整，用不着像过去那样重新来一次查田定产。（2）在农业合作化以后，土地由合作社统一经营，农业税由合作社统一交纳，常年产量的调整也可以采取以乡或者以社为单位按比例提高的方法，不需要像过去那样逐丘逐块地评定了。（3）农业生产合作社的实际产量有了帐簿的记载，不需要像过去那样花费很多的时间去进行调查评议。这些都是进行这个工作的有利条件。各级人民委员会可以充分利用这些有利的条件，采取简单而有效的方法来进行。比如县人民委员会可以指定一部分干部，结合农村其他工作做好有关常年产量的调查研究，经过试算，提出调整方案，然后，召集乡、社干部会议，讨论通过。像这样的做法，花费的力量和时间是不会很多的。
    既然提高后的常年产量只相当于1957年实际产量的78％左右，能不能再多提高一些常年产量，从而多降低一点税率呢？经过同各地同志反复研究，大家认为这是不适宜的。因为：（1）对于兴修农田水利而提高单位面积产量的，需要给予优待，不能提高到实际产量的水平。对于先进的生产单位和地区，为了鼓励增产，常年产量也不能提高过多。（2）经济作物的常年产量，并不是按照经济作物的产量来评定的，而是参照粮食作物的产量来评定的。虽然对获利较大的经济作物可以比粮田常年产量订得稍高一些，但比经济作物本身的实际产量还是低得很多。（3）在农业实际产量内，包括着一部分免税的产量（如新垦荒地的产量等），这部分产量是不能计入征税的常年产量的。（4）按照目前的情况，原来的常年产量同实际产量距离较大的，主要是在比较贫瘠的地区，而原来税率较高的，主要是在比较富庶的地区。如果过多地提高常年产量和降低税率，就会加重贫瘠地区的负担，减轻富庶地区的负担。
    条例草案规定全国平均税率15.5％，同1957年全国平均税率16.5％比较，降低了1％左右。这个降低的比例，是一个平均数字，具体到各省、自治区、直辖市就不一致了。国务院拟定的各省、自治区、直辖市的平均税率，有的降低较多，有的没有降低，少数地区还稍有提高。这是因为目前各地一般仍是沿用1952年以前规定的税率，各个地区之间的农民负担原来就存在着某些不够合理的现象，再加上几年来各地生产发展的不平衡，又产生了一些新的不合理现象。因此，我们这次拟定税率的时候，对各省、自治区、直辖市的平均税率进行了适当的调整，这是必要的。
    由于各地区每个农民的平均土地数量有多有少，单位面积产量有高有低，因此，各地区的平均税率经过调整以后，仍然是有的高、有的低。但是，如果从征收农业税以后每个农民的余粮来看，则是比较合理的。如辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省的平均税率虽然比全国平均税率高2.5％—3.5％，而交纳农业税以后的余粮，以1957年为例，每人平均高达七百三十斤——一千五百斤，超过全国平均五百八十斤左右的水平。这种情况说明，这三个省的平均税率稍高一些是适当的。各地区的平均税率经过这一次调整以后，农民负担将比过去进一步平衡和合理。但是，这种平衡和合理，只能是相对的、暂时的，在农业生产大跃进之后，全国各地又将出现新的不平衡，这种新的不平衡，经过一个时期，需要继续加以调整。
    最后，我还要说明一下，这个草案在统一的方针、政策下充分体现了因地制宜的灵活性。一方面，对于必须统一的重大政策问题，在草案中都作了统一的规定。另一方面，由于我国幅员广大，情况复杂，各地经济发展很不平衡，也完全有必要给予地方人民委员会以较大的机动权力，以便在中央统一领导之下，充分发挥地方的积极性和主动性，使农业税条例的实施能够更好地适应各地区的不同情况。因此，这个草案中有许多条文，都作了灵活的规定。例如各个地方的农业税的税率、对个体农民加征的具体成数、地方附加的比例、某些农业收入的计算标准、有关奖励生产的优待办法和照顾灾区的减税和免税办法等，都授权地方人民委员会在条例草案规定的范围以内加以具体规定。属于临时性、地区性的问题和执行方面的问题，则全部授权地方规定。所有这些规定，都是必要的，也是符合我国农村的实际情况的。
    以上是关于新的农业税条例（草案）的说明，请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。
