Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 16th - The French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labour have called for a grand "Day to Defend the Republic" to be held on June 18th. Many local vigilance committees for the defense of the Republic have also proposed holding demonstrations on that day to oppose dictatorship.

June 18th is a day of commemoration for the French people in defense of the Republic. On this day in 1936, the Popular Front government dissolved the rebel leagues of the time, thereby defending the Republic. The rioters organized in the so-called "Committee of Public Safety" are preparing to usurp this anniversary to organize fascist demonstrations against the Republic.

The National Association of Former Resistance Fighters, at its congress held in Paris on the 14th, issued a letter to resistance fighters, condemning the already established so-called "Committees of Public Safety" and demanding their dissolution. The communique also called on all resistance fighters and Republicans to unite and take action in order to forcefully counter all attempts by rioters to impose their laws on the people.

The French Veterans' Federation also issued a communique calling on former resistance fighters, veterans, and war victims to respond to the call to hold demonstrations to defend the Republic.

The call of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labour has been widely echoed. The Brest Committee for the Defense of the Republic, composed of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and fourteen other organizations, will convene a mass meeting on June 18th; miners in Denain have also decided to hold a short strike on June 18th to express their will to maintain freedom.

    法国共产党和总工会号召
    6月18日举行保卫共和日
    新华社巴黎16日电　法国共产党和法国总工会号召在6月18日举行盛大的保卫共和日。许多地方的保卫共和警惕委员会也倡议在那一天举行示威游行反对独裁制。
    6月18日是法国人民保卫共和的纪念日，在1936年的这一天，人民阵线政府解散了当时的叛乱分子联盟从而保卫了共和。组织在所谓“救国委员会”中的暴乱分子准备盗用这个纪念日来组织反对共和的法西斯示威。
    14日在巴黎举行的前抵抗战士全国协会代表大会发表了告抵抗战士书，谴责已经成立的所谓“救国委员会”，并要求解散它们。公报还号召所有的抵抗战士和共和人士团结一致采取行动，以便有力地反击暴乱分子想把他们的法律强加于人的一切企图。
    法兰西退伍军人联盟也发表公报号召前抵抗战士、退伍军人和战争受害者响应举行示威保卫共和的号召。
    法国共产党和法国总工会的号召已经获得了广泛的响应。由共产党、社会党等十四个组织组成的布勒斯特保卫共和委员会将在6月18日召开群众大会；登隆西纳的矿工们也决定在6月18日举行短时间的罢工以表示他们维护自由的意志。
