Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th: The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting on the 10th to discuss the Lebanese government's so-called "complaint" against the United Arab Republic.

The representative of the United Arab Republic, Loutfi, spoke first. He refuted the false accusations made by Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik against the United Arab Republic at the previous Security Council meeting.

Lebanese representative Malik further slandered the United Arab Republic, insisting that the United Arab Republic's "interference" in Lebanon was "intensifying."

Swedish representative Jarring put forward a proposal requesting the United Nations to "immediately dispatch" an observation committee to Lebanon to investigate and "ensure that there is no illegal infiltration of personnel into Lebanon or illegal transportation of weapons or other materials into Lebanon."

United States representative Lodge and British representative Dixon supported the Swedish proposal. Lodge said that his government had reached a "clear conclusion" that the "interference" in Lebanon came from the United Arab Republic. Dixon also chimed in, saying that he believed Lebanon should receive the Security Council's "assistance."

Soviet representative Sobolev, in his speech, exposed the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs and demanded that the Security Council reject Lebanon's "complaint" against the United Arab Republic.

Sobolev pointed out that Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik's accusations against the United Arab Republic were groundless, and that what Malik said was actually the words of the US-British ruling clique.

Sobolev pointed out that Lebanon is indeed threatened by foreign interference, but this threat does not come from the United Arab Republic but from the West. Western imperialist blocs consider Lebanon an important base in the Arab East. The United States and Britain have agreed to jointly interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, and their armed forces are increasingly approaching the Lebanese coast, and the United States has also transported heavy weapons to Lebanon. Now the United States and Britain are trying to use the so-called "interference" of the United Arab Republic in Lebanon as a pretext for their real interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

Sobolev emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that any intervention by any country or the Security Council in Lebanon's internal affairs is intolerable.

The Security Council finally decided to continue the meeting on the 11th to allow representatives to continue speaking and to vote on the Swedish proposal.

    苏联代表在安理会会议上揭露
    美英同谋干涉黎巴嫩内政
    要求拒绝黎巴嫩对阿联的诬告
    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会10日继续举行会议，讨论黎巴嫩政府对阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓“控诉”。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲首先发言。驳斥黎巴嫩外交部长马利克在安理会上次会议上对阿拉伯联合共和国的诬告。
    黎巴嫩代表马利克进一步诽谤阿拉伯联合共和国，硬说阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩的“干涉”正在“加紧”。
    瑞典代表雅林提出了一项提案，要求联合国“立即派遣”一个观察委员会到黎巴嫩进行调查，以“确保并没有人员非法渗入黎巴嫩或者没有武器或其他物资非法运入黎巴嫩”。
    美国代表洛奇和英国代表狄克逊支持瑞典的提案。洛奇说，他的政府已经得出“明确的结论”：对黎巴嫩的“干涉”来自阿拉伯联合共和国。狄克逊也帮腔说，他认为黎巴嫩应该得到安全理事会的“援助”。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言时揭露美英两国打算干涉黎巴嫩内政的阴谋，并要求安全理事会拒绝黎巴嫩对阿拉伯联合共和国的“控诉”。
    索波列夫指出，黎巴嫩外交部长马利克对阿拉伯联合共和国的指责是毫无根据的，马利克所说的实际上是美英统治集团的话。
    索波列夫指出，黎巴嫩目前确是受到外来干涉的威胁，但是这个威胁不是来自阿拉伯联合共和国而是来自西方。西方帝国主义集团认为黎巴嫩是它们在阿拉伯东方的一个重要基地。美英两国已经协议要共同干涉黎巴嫩内政，它们的武装部队正在越来越逼近黎巴嫩海岸，美国还把重型武器运到黎巴嫩去。现在美英两国正试图以所谓阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩的“干涉”作为它们真正干涉黎巴嫩内政的借口。
    索波列夫强调说，苏联认为，任何一个国家或者安全理事会对黎巴嫩内政的干预都是不能容忍的。
    安全理事会最后决定在11日继续举行会议，以便让代表们继续发言和就瑞典的提案进行表决。
