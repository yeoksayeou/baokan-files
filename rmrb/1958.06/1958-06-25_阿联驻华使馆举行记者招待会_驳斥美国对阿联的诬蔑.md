Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The Counselor of the Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China, Shebinni, today sternly condemned the United States' slanderous rumors about the United Arab Republic "interfering" in Lebanon's internal affairs. At a press conference held this afternoon for Chinese and foreign journalists, he said that, in fact, it is the United States and the Baghdad Pact countries that are interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs.

Shebinni said that the US government is supplying fascist organizations in Lebanon with various weapons, including aircraft. The jets currently in use in Lebanon are being flown by experienced pilots from the United States, Britain, and Jordan. The fact that some Jordanian troops have surrendered to the people's armed forces further proves that the Baghdad Pact countries have participated in the war.

Shebinni said that due to the Anglo-American intervention in Lebanon, even some NATO countries have expressed their disgust and unease.

He said: "If the situation deteriorates due to Anglo-American interference in Lebanon, the opposition party may therefore seek assistance from volunteer forces from all Arab countries, and the subsequent situation will be difficult to control."

Shebinni also said that the US's diplomatic strategy of supporting Chamoun against the Lebanese people "is pushing the Middle East to the brink of war."

Shebinni concluded by saying that the current situation in Lebanon is entirely an internal affair and should be resolved by the Lebanese people themselves, and no other country should interfere.

    阿联驻华使馆举行记者招待会
    驳斥美国对阿联的诬蔑
    新华社24日讯　阿拉伯联合共和国驻华大使馆参赞谢宾尼今天严词谴责美国关于诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”黎巴嫩内政的谰言。他在今天下午举行的中外记者招待会上说，事实上正是美国和巴格达条约国家在干涉黎巴嫩的内政。
    谢宾尼说，美国政府正以包括飞机在内的各种武器供应黎巴嫩的法西斯组织。目前黎巴嫩使用的喷气机都是由美国、英国和约旦的有经验的驾驶员驾驶。一部分约旦军队已向人民武装部队投降，这更证明巴格达条约国已经参加了战争。
    谢宾尼说，由于英美在黎巴嫩进行的干预，甚至一些北大西洋集团的国家都表示了他们的厌恶和不安。
    他说：“情况若因英美在黎巴嫩的干涉而发生恶化，反对党可能因此要向所有阿拉伯国家征求志愿军的援助，往后的局势则将难以控制。”
    谢宾尼又说，美国支持夏蒙来对抗黎巴嫩人民的外交策略“正将中东引向战争的边缘”。
    谢宾尼最后说：黎巴嫩目前的情况完全是内政问题，应该由黎巴嫩人民自己来解决，任何别的国家都不应该进行干涉。
