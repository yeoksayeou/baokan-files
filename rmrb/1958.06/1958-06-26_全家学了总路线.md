    The Whole Family Has Studied the General Line
  Mom studied the General Line,
  And put down her spatula to go to the fields;
  Women must compete with men,
  To seize the red flag and plant it at the door!
  Older brother studied the General Line,
  Asked the captain to contract more land,
  Boldly innovate and diligently delve,
  Determined to double the grain yield!
  Younger brother studied the General Line,
  Carrying a schoolbag and a carrying pole.
  Picking up manure on the way to and from school,
  Guaranteed to collect two loads a day!
  Dad studied the General Line,
  His eyes narrowed into a line with laughter.
  He dashed to the commune,
  Requesting to plant experimental fields!
  Grandma's heart itched when she heard,
  Her toothless lips smiled brightly.
  Listen to the words of our benefactor Chairman Mao,
  Each year is sweeter than the last.
      Hubei, Li Zuming

    全家学了总路线
  妈妈学了总路线，
  放下锅铲就下畈；
  妇女要和男子比，
  夺取红旗插门前！
  哥哥学了总路线，
  要求队长再包产，
  大胆革新苦心钻，
  坚决把粮食翻一番！
  弟弟学了总路线，
  挂着书包扛扁担。
  上学放学都拾粪，
  一天保证捡两担！
  老爹学了总路线，
  两眼笑得一条线。
  拔腿就往社里跑，
  要求去种试验田！
  婆婆听得心里痒，
  没牙的嘴唇笑得闪。
  要听恩人毛主席的话，
  一年才比一年甜。
