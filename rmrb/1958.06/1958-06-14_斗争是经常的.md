    Struggle is Constant
    Wu Lü
    In the past few months, the right-leaning conservative thinking in the industrial sector has been defeated by the masses of workers and staff who used countless big-character posters and tens of millions of new records and creations to launch fierce attacks. The promoters are triumphantly singing praises, the plans are becoming more and more magnificent, and the indicators are becoming more and more advanced. Millions of laborers are putting plans and indicators into practice. Under this victorious situation of galloping horses, some comrades believe that right-leaning conservative thinking no longer exists, and that "the situation forces people," so who would dare to be associated with right-leaning conservatism again?
    We say: things are not entirely like this. Not to mention that even when the promoters are triumphantly singing praises and right-leaning conservative thinking is declared defeated, there are still doubtful "watchers of the tide" and people who "follow the crowd"; even in places where the red flag of the promoters is flying high, new right-leaning conservative thoughts will constantly emerge with the development of the movement and the emergence of new difficulties. If anyone doesn't believe it, please read today's news in this newspaper about the major industrial inspections in Chongqing and Guangzhou.
    Thinking that right-leaning conservative thinking has been overthrown and can be "done once and for all" and will never arise again is, from a methodological point of view, a metaphysical viewpoint. We are dialectical materialists, and dialectical materialists are proponents of "continuous revolution." In our view, there is no such thing as "done once and for all" in the world. Permanent projects seem to be "done once and for all," but in fact all permanent projects require constant maintenance and have only a certain warranty period. The same is especially true of matters in the ideological field. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out as frequently as washing one's face. Right-leaning conservative thinking is defeated in this round, but will rise again in the next round, and it is absolutely impossible to "do it once and for all." This requires us to continuously revolutionize and constantly struggle against it.
    Why is right-leaning conservative thinking so stubborn? This is because right-leaning conservative thinking is not something "external," and it is by no means something that you can "immunize" yourself from by being afraid to be associated with it and staying far away from it. Right-leaning conservative thinking is the inevitable result of subjective understanding lagging behind the development of objective things. We know that existence determines consciousness, the subjective is a reflection of the objective, the development of social material conditions always precedes the development of ideology, and people's subjective understanding is often behind objective reality. The objective world is constantly developing, and old things are constantly being replaced by new things. In this endless movement of objective things, some people strive to make their subjective understanding conform to the development of objective reality, understand the laws of objective things, and use these laws to transform the objective world and make the objective world serve the people. This is "striving to go upstream," this is the promoting faction. However, in the development of objective things, there are always some people whose subjective understanding cannot fully reflect the objective changes, "looking at new things with the old calendar," and right-leaning conservative thinking will involuntarily attach itself to them. No matter how unwilling these people are, no matter how firmly they deny it, once their thinking lags behind reality and the subjective contradicts the objective, they will inevitably fall into the quagmire of right-leaning conservatism.
    Thinking lagging behind reality and the subjective contradicting the objective are eternal phenomena in social life. We promote dialectical materialism, hoping that more people can establish this most scientific worldview and methodology, so that thinking conforms to reality and the subjective conforms to the objective. To struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking is to help comrades with right-leaning conservative thinking catch up with the development of the objective situation through specific struggles, and to ensure that our construction cause continues to leap forward. However, at any time, people's understanding cannot be completely consistent, especially in the alternation of old and new things, and when objective things develop from quantitative change to qualitative change, there will always be some people whose subjective understanding will lag behind, and there will always be right-leaning conservative thinking; therefore, our struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking is always constant. Whoever does not understand this cannot continue to leap forward.

    斗争是经常的
    吴滤
    过去几个月里，工业部门的右倾保守思想，经不住广大职工群众用无数张大字报和千万个新纪录、新创造的猛攻猛打，已经宣告败北了。促进派高奏凯歌，规划一次比一次更宏伟，指标一次比一次更先进，千万人的劳动大军正把一个个规划、一项项指标付诸实现。在这种万马奔腾的胜利形势下，有些同志以为右倾保守思想再也不存在了，“形势逼人”，谁还敢再沾右倾保守的边？
    我们说：事情并不完全是这样了。且不谈即便是在促进派高奏凯歌，右倾保守思想宣告败北的时候，也还有半信半疑的“观潮派”和“随大流”的人；就是在高插促进派红旗的地方，随着运动的发展，随着新的困难的出现，也会不断地出现新的右倾保守思想。谁若不信，请看今天本报发表的重庆市和广州市工业大检查的新闻。
    以为右倾保守思想既经打倒，就可以“一劳永逸”，再也不会产生，从思想方法上说，是一种形而上学的观点。我们是辩证唯物主义者，辩证唯物主义者是“不断革命”论者。在我们看来，世界上并没有“一劳永逸”的事情。永久性的工程看来是“一劳永逸”的，其实一切永久性的工程都需要不断维修，而且都只有一定的保险期。思想领域的事情更是如此。批评和自我批评要像洗脸一样地经常进行。右倾保守思想在这一回合中败北，在下一回合中还会再起，绝不可能“一劳永逸”，这就需要我们不断革命，不断同它作斗争。
    为什么右倾保守思想这样顽强呢？这是因为右倾保守思想不是什么“身外之物”，决不是你不敢沾边，离得远远的，因而就可以“免疫”的。右倾保守思想是主观认识落后于客观事物发展的必然结果。我们知道，存在决定意识，主观是客观的反映，社会物质条件的发展总是先于意识形态的发展，人们的主观认识也常常是落后于客观实际的。客观世界不断地发展着，旧的事物不断地为新的事物代替，在这种永无休止的客观事物的运动中，有些人努力使自己的主观认识符合客观实际的发展，洞察客观事物的规律，利用这种规律来改造客观世界，让客观世界为人民服务。这就是“力争上游”，这就是促进派。但是，在客观事物的发展中，也总有一些人的主观认识不能完全反映客观的变化，“用老皇历看新事物”，右倾保守思想就不由自主地附在他们身上。不管这些人多么的不情愿，多么坚决的否认，一旦思想落后于实际，主观同客观发生矛盾，就不可避免地陷到右倾保守的泥坑中去。
    思想落后于实际，主观同客观矛盾，是社会生活中永远的现象。我们宣传辩证唯物主义，希望能有更多的人能够树立这个最科学的世界观和方法论，从而使思想符合于实际，主观符合于客观。同右倾保守思想作斗争，就是通过具体的斗争，帮助有右倾保守思想的同志赶上客观形势的发展，保证我们的建设事业不断地跃进。但是，在任何时候，人们的认识也不可能完全一致，特别是在新旧事物的交替中，在客观事物由量变向质变发展的时候，总有些人的主观认识会落在后面，总会有右倾保守思想；因而我们同右倾保守思想的斗争总是经常的。谁不了解这一点，谁就不能不断地跃进。
