    Daming Typewriter Shop Was Originally an Illegal Business
    After seeing Sun Qilian’s letter published in your newspaper’s “Letters” column on May 5th criticizing the Daming Typewriter Shop in the Qianmen District for not refunding the balance, it was verified that this shop was originally a self-employed business. Last year, due to illegal activities, the manager of this shop was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment by the Qianmen District Court. The criminal was not satisfied with the verdict and has now appealed to the Municipal Intermediate People's Court for review. We are specifically informing Sun Qilian of this situation and hope that he will file a complaint with the Qianmen District Court.

    大明打字机行原来是个违法户
    见到5月5日你报“来信”栏内刊登孙其连批评前门区大明打字机行余款不退的来信后，经查明这户原来是个体经营户，去年因有违法行为，这个行的经理已被前门区法院判处有期徒刑十年，该犯不服判决，现已上诉到市中级人民法院审理。我们特将这个情况转告孙其连，并希望他向前门区法院提起控诉。
