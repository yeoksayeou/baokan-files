Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 25th: Glass fertilizer, which can only be manufactured by a few countries in the world such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and West Germany, has recently been successfully trial-produced by three young technicians from the Shanghai Glass Factory.

The glass fertilizer successfully researched by Wu Jiaxin, Fan Zhenxian, and Wu Zhenqun, three young technicians from the Shanghai Glass Factory, is a new type of fertilizer that has only been developed in recent years in foreign countries. This fertilizer contains many trace elements necessary for plant growth, such as copper, zinc, manganese, boron, and molybdenum. After the salts of these elements are mixed and sintered with glass powder and then ground into particles, they can be well absorbed directly by the roots of plants. Because it dissolves slowly in the soil, one application can last for several years, and because it is solid, it will not be washed away by water, making it particularly suitable for paddy fields. According to Soviet experiments on certain crops, the use of glass fertilizer can increase crop yields by 21% to 59%.

Wu Jiaxin and the other two technicians are only twenty-four or five years old this year and have only been working for three or four years. At the beginning of this year, seeing the great development of agricultural production, they wanted to research glass fertilizer. However, although they read a lot of foreign literature, they were not very confident whether the experiment would succeed. In mid-June, they studied the general line of socialist construction, and their daring spirit was greatly liberated. They were determined to break away from books and first seek a manufacturing method from practice. At this time, they also found Soviet technical data on glass fertilizer, which was very rich and specific. They worked hard for three days and three nights, experimenting more than twenty times, and finally trial-produced the first batch of glass fertilizer on the 16th. On the 24th, the factory received a report from the Shanghai Institute of Materials Application Science stating that after analysis and testing, the quality of the glass fertilizer they trial-produced fully met the requirements. At present, the Shanghai Glass Factory is conducting further research and preparing for mass production.

    青年技术员制成玻璃肥料
    这种新型肥料，世界上还只有苏联、美国、西德等几个国家能够制造；这种肥料施肥一次，肥效可以长达几年。
    据新华社上海25日电　世界上只有苏联、美国、西德等少数几个国家能够制造的玻璃肥料，最近由上海玻璃厂三个青年技术员试制成功。
    上海玻璃厂吴家欣、范震先、巫振群三个青年技术员所研究成功的玻璃肥料，在国外也是近年来才发展起来的一种新型肥料。这种肥料包含着植物生长所必需的铜、锌、锰、硼、钼等许多种微量元素。这些元素的盐类和玻璃粉末混合烧结以后，再磨成颗粒，就能很好地被植物的根所直接吸收。由于它在土壤中是慢慢地溶解，因此施一次肥，肥效可以长达几年之久，并且因为是固体，不会被水冲走，特别适用于水稻田。根据苏联在某些农作物上的试验，使用玻璃肥料，农作物产量可以提高21％到59％。
    吴家欣等三个技术员今年都只有二十四、五岁，参加工作也只有三、四年。今年年初，他们看到农业生产的大发展，就想研究玻璃肥料。但是当时尽管看了许多国外文献资料，能否试验成功，信心不高。6月中旬，他们学习了社会主义建设总路线，敢作敢为的思想大大解放，决心跳出书本，先从实践来求得制造方法。这时候，他们还找到了苏联在玻璃肥料方面的技术资料，内容非常丰富具体。他们连续苦干了三天三夜，试验了二十多次，终于在16日试制出第一批玻璃肥料。24日，厂里接到上海材料应用科学研究所的报告，经过分析化验，他们试制的玻璃肥料质量完全符合要求。目前，上海玻璃厂正在进一步研究，准备大量生产。
