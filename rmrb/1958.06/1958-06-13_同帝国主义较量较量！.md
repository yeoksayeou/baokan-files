Let's Compete with Imperialism!
    Wen Shan
    In the People's Daily on May 29th this year, on the third page, a large-character headline was used to publish an article by Comrade Peng Tao, Minister of Chemical Industry: "We must compete with all capitalist countries in the chemical industry." This title and the content of the article invigorate people, build up our ambition, and deflate the enemy's arrogance. It is truly the bold voice of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward.

    The article states: Our steel and coal will certainly catch up with all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time, and even in the chemical industry, we do not have to compete with them in everything, because in terms of chemical fertilizers, it is possible to surpass the United States by 1962. Where do we choose our arena? It is in the field of organic synthetic industry (plastics, etc.) and basic chemical industry (inorganic salts, etc.). This is the weakest front in our entire economic front, and our plastics industry is still a blank slate. The United States, however, is currently the most developed country in the world in the organic synthetic industry, with a production of more than three million tons of various plastics, synthetic rubber, and synthetic fibers.

    What does this mean? This means that we are competing with the strongest in their strongest area, using our weakest; we are not comparing ourselves with the opponent's small fry, but with the number one imperialist.

    Heroes and good men who compete in the ring must choose the most evil to fight. This is the traditional spirit of the Chinese people.

    To say "compete" is to give them some credit. But it must be made clear that in many areas, imperialism is simply not worthy of competing with us. The capitalist economy that suffers from malaria; the rotten and stinking capitalist politics; the low-level and vulgar bourgeois "literature"; the "surrealism" of apes and donkeys... What kind of competition can we have with these things? Our lofty communist ideals, the ever-improving national morality—which an Indian friend called "the purity of spirit and soul"—and the prospect of a "four-without country"... Unless the filthy bourgeoisie are all dead, none of these can exist in their country, nor is there anything to compete with. As for the battlefield, American imperialism, leading its many capitalist lackeys, has already competed with us in Korea. Truman and Dulles remember this account very well, so there is no need to repeat it.

    However, having said that, imperialism and its partners still have something to comfort themselves with; in some areas, they are destined to always be at the "forefront," and we are truly "unable to catch up." For example, the number of cases of corruption, murder, rape, and theft, the number of parasites, prostitutes, and unemployed people, etc., for us, these will become blank spots, or are already blank spots, and we will never compete with them.

    These are all facts. We are humble and never speak rashly. But the imperialists may not be convinced when they hear this. A few months ago, when they heard that our "Hero" gold pen was catching up with "Parker," wasn't there a bourgeois journalist who couldn't stand it and actually questioned our workers, "What makes you think you can catch up with Parker!" But, we are not only going to catch up with Parker, closely following, the "Changjiang" accordion proposed to catch up with the famous Italian brand "Soprani" within a year, the tires of the Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory are catching up with "Dunlop," the "Forever" and "Flying Pigeon" bicycles are catching up with and even surpassing the famous British "Raleigh," and "Beijing," "Ostrich," and "Hongyan" inks have surpassed or are catching up with Parker "51" and "21." Shanghai alone already has more than 20 products (including grinding machines) that have surpassed British famous brands. These now seem to be "small matters," but if we go back to the Kuomintang ruling era more than ten years ago when even light bulbs could not be made, all of this would be dreams!

    Now, from heavy industry to light industry, from steel to ink, in all areas where we need to catch up with and overwhelm imperialism, we must compete with them, and we will never be falsely modest!

    "What makes you think you can?" That's a good question!

    We rely on the leadership of the Communist Party, on the "decisive factor" of 600 million people; on the "vigorous development of the communist spirit throughout the country"; on the "rapid improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses, and the backward strata of the masses are striving to catch up with the advanced strata"; on the fact that "we have never seen the people so invigorated, with such high morale, and in such high spirits"; on the fact that "the working people on the 9.6 million square kilometers of the People's Republic of China are now truly beginning to rule this land," and if that's not enough, we can add another sentence—relying on "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind!"

    It is because of these that within a few months, on this "poor and blank" land, more than a hundred various types of tractors, large and small, will suddenly emerge from all directions; in this field that has "relied on agriculture for thousands of years," batches of iron smelting furnaces will grow like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. It is because of these that in Fengshugang Village in Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province, which has only ten households, the farmers themselves, based on drawings and a "Simplified Electrical Handbook," installed water turbines and generators, and the electric lights were turned on during the "March 8th" International Women's Day. If you go to Yongchun County, Fujian Province, you can see slogans everywhere saying "Achieve preliminary rural electrification in 1958!" and find that the peasants' couplets have changed the words related to cooperativization to words related to electrification. A single spark will start a prairie fire, and nationwide electrification is not far off! When peace-loving people all over the world see these bright pearls in the mountains and fields, who can fail to be filled with joy and full of faith in the future!

    Decades ago, Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, who launched World War I, predicted in his famous "Kaiser's Plan to Unify the World" that China was a "sleeping lion"; now, British newspapers are calling the new China a "giant dragon of the East," saying that this "giant dragon" has followed behind the aging British Empire. Imperialism is uneasy about China and imagines it to be very terrible, but in the minds of peace-loving people all over the world, in the minds of our comrades and friends, China is so beautiful! As Neruda said: "From ocean to ocean, from plain to snow mountain, all the nations of the world are looking at you, ah, China! They say: 'What a strong brother has appeared among us!'" At the 7th Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on June 2, Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said: We can imagine what the world will be like in ten to fifteen years, when the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in terms of per capita output of the most important industrial and agricultural products, when China leaves Britain behind in industrial production, and when other socialist countries have also achieved new and significant achievements in their economic and cultural development!

    Yes, what will the world be like then? What will our great motherland become like? Although imperialist elements such as Dulles are dead and opposed to us, "willing to meet God with a granite head," what does it matter! The dust raised by hundreds of millions of people marching towards communism can cover the broken tombs and lonely graves of this small handful of imperialist diehards. Let our talented poets wield their giant pens and speed up the depiction of the "newest and most beautiful picture" of our communist world!

    同帝国主义较量较量！
    闻山
    人民日报今年5月29日第三版上，用大字标题登了化学工业部部长彭涛同志的一篇文章：“我们要在化学工业上同一切资本主义国家较量较量”。这个标题和文章的内容，使人精神奋发，长自己志气，灭对手威风，真是大跃进的中国人民的豪迈声气。
    文章里说：我国的钢铁和煤炭，肯定能够在较短的时间内赶上一切资本主义国家，而且，就是在化学工业方面，也不是全都要和他们较量，因为在化学肥料方面，到1962年，也有可能超过美国。我们挑选的比武场在哪里呢？是在有机合成工业（塑料等）和基本化学工业（无机盐等）方面。这是我们整个经济战线中最薄弱的一个战线，我们的塑料工业还是个空白点。而美国却是目前世界上有机合成工业最发达的国家，各种塑料、合成橡胶、合成纤维，生产量已达三百多万吨。
    这是什么意思呢？这是说，我们是拿自己最弱的和人家最强的较量；我们要比的不是对方的小伙计，而是头号的帝国主义。
    英雄好汉打擂台，要挑最恶的打。这是中国人民传统的气概。
    说较量，是看得起他们。但要说清楚，在许多地方，帝国主义根本不配和我们较量。发疟疾的资本主义经济；腐烂发臭的资本主义政治；低级下流的资产阶级“文学”；猩猩和驴子的“超现实主义”……这些东西和我们谈什么较量？我们崇高的共产主义理想，日益提高的国民道德——一位印度友人称之为“精神与灵魂的洁净”——还有“四无国”的前景……除非一身脏污的资产阶级通通死绝，这一切在他们的国度里就不能存在，也没有可以较量的。至于在战场上，美帝国主义率领着那许多资本主义国家的喽罗，早就在朝鲜和我们较量过，这笔账杜鲁门和杜勒斯都记得很清楚，就用不着再说了。
    但是，话说回来，帝国主义和他的伙伴们还是有其可以自慰之处；在某些领域里，他们注定了要永远走在“最前面”，我们真是“望尘莫及”的。例如贪污、凶杀、奸淫、盗窃的案件，寄生虫、娼妓、失业者的数目等等，在我们，这些将要成为空白点，或者已经是空白点，我们永远不会和他们竞赛。
    这都是事实。我们是谦虚的，绝不口出妄语。但是帝国主义分子们听了，却不见得会服气。前几个月，刚听说我们的“英雄”金笔要赶上“派克”，不是有一个资产阶级的记者就受不住了，居然去质问我们的工人“你们凭什么赶派克”么！可是，我们不但要赶派克，紧跟着，“长江”牌手风琴就提出，要在一年内赶上意大利名牌“索勃拉尼”，上海正泰橡胶厂的轮胎，要赶“邓禄普”，“永久”牌、“飞鸽”牌自行车，正在赶上甚至超过英国著名“凤头”牌，“北京”、“鸵鸟”、“红岩”墨水已经超过或正在赶上派克“五一”、“二一”。光是上海，就已经有二十多种产品（包括磨床）压倒了英国名牌货。这些现在看来已经是“小意思”了，但如果回到十几年前连电灯泡都做不了的国民党统治年代，这一切就都是梦想！
    现在，从重工业到轻工业，从钢铁到墨水，在一切需要赶上并且压倒帝国主义的地方，我们都要和他们较量较量，我们决不假谦虚！
    “你们凭什么？”问得真好！
    我们，凭共产党的领导，凭六亿人口这个“决定的因素”；凭“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展”；凭“广大群众的政治觉悟迅速提高，群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层”；凭“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”；凭“中华人民共和国九百六十万平方公里上面的劳动人民，现在真正开始统治这块地方”，如果还嫌不够的话，还可以加一句——凭“东风压倒西风”！
    就是凭这些，所以几个月之内，在这块“一穷二白”的土地上，会有一百多种各式各样、大大小小的拖拉机，忽然从四方八面涌将出来；会在这几千年“以农立国”的原野里，像春笋一样，长出了一批批的炼铁炉。就是凭这些，所以在江西定南县只有十户人家的枫树岗村，农民自己根据图样和一本“电工简易手册”，就安装了水轮机和发电机，“三八”节时电灯亮了。如果你到福建永春县，你就到处可以看到“1958年实现农村初步电气化！”的标语，发现农民的门联已经把有关合作化的字眼改成了有关电气化的字眼。星星之火，即将燎原，全国电气化为期不远了！全世界爱好和平的人民看到这些山村，原野里的夜明珠，谁能不满心欢喜，对未来充满信念！
    几十年前，发动第一次世界大战的德皇威廉第一，曾在他那本著名的“德皇统一世界策”中预言，中国是一头“睡狮”；现在，英国的报纸又管新中国叫做“东方的巨龙”；说是这条“巨龙”已经跟在衰老的大英帝国背后了。帝国主义对中国不放心，而且想像得非常可怕，可是在全世界爱好和平的人们的心目中，在我们的同志和朋友的心目中，中国，却是多么美丽！正像聂鲁达说的：“从海洋到海洋，从平原到雪山，世界各民族一起望着你，啊，中国！他们说：‘我们当中出现了一个多么坚强的兄弟啊！’”保共中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫同志6月2日在保共第七次代表大会上说：我们可以设想一下，再过十年到十五年以后，当苏联在最重要的工农业产品按人口计算的产量方面超过美国的时候，当中国在工业生产方面把英国抛在后面的时候，当其他社会主义国家在自己的经济和文化的发展方面也取得了新的显著成就的时候，那时的世界将成为什么样子！
    是啊，那时的世界将成为什么样子？我们伟大的祖国又将变成什么样子？尽管帝国主义分子如杜勒斯之流死和我们作对，“愿意带着花岗岩头脑去见上帝”，那又有什么关系！亿万人朝共产主义大踏步前进扬起的尘土，就能盖过这一小撮帝国主义顽固派的破墓孤坟。让我们的天才诗人们挥起如椽巨笔，加速描绘我们共产主义世界“最新最美的画图”！
