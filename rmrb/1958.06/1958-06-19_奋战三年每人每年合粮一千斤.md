Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 18th: Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently gave important instructions on current agricultural production at the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee in Anhui Province. He urged all localities to deeply recognize the great political significance of this year's agricultural leap forward, to forge ahead courageously under any circumstances, and to strive to increase the nation's grain production by more than 20% this year. He said that based on his recent inspection of more than 20 counties in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, it is not only possible to achieve this production target, but there is also hope of exceeding it.

He first praised the people of northern Anhui for their ambition to build water conservancy projects last winter and this spring, to transform northern Anhui into a network of waterways and paddy fields. He said that the fact that Fuyang and Bengbu prefectures in northern Anhui were still able to convert millions of mu of land to rice cultivation this year, despite the particularly severe drought, proves that the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's policy of water-netting northern Anhui is correct and proves that the implementation of this policy has achieved great success.

He said that water-netting is very good. With many large ditches and deep ponds, there is plenty of water, and more rice can be planted. Every village and commune can be connected by boat. Plant three rows of trees along the ditches, and with water and trees, the entire climate of northern Anhui will change. With trees, not only can they prevent wind, but the large amount of timber needed by the northern Anhui coalfields in the future, and the timber used by the masses to build houses, can be solved locally. With a water network in northern Anhui, several new Huai River channels will all be connected to Hongze Lake, which will fundamentally solve the problem of flooding in the Huai River, and it can be announced that the work of permanently controlling the Huai River has been completed.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin expressed his impressions of agricultural production in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and other places. He believes that the masses in these areas are very enthusiastic, and the leading organs and cadres are mostly working hard and competing with each other, and have already figured out a set of experiences in leading agricultural production. This is a major feature of this year. He said that among the twelve measures of the National Agricultural Development Program, the following points seem particularly important now: water conservancy, fertilizer, deep plowing, improved varieties, close planting, field management, and tool reform. He said that the issue of increasing the multiple cropping index should be carried out according to specific circumstances. Regarding the issue of planting various high-yield crops, some crops that were originally considered low-yield (such as wheat) have now also seen large-scale high-yield production, so there should be no fixed views on high-yield crops. He said that we should strive to turn low-yield crops into high-yield crops.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin believes that the following three issues should be urgently addressed in current agricultural production: first, the issue of early planning; second, the issue of tool reform; and third, the issue of improving labor organization. Regarding the issue of early planning, he said that from now on, the work of building water conservancy projects this winter should be planned. How much water needs to be stored in this area, how many culverts should be built, and how many roads should be repaired should all be considered so that large-scale water conservancy projects can be carried out quickly in October. He said that many railways will be built in the Second Five-Year Plan. When planning water conservancy, we must study where trains and heavy trucks will run and where ships will sail, based on these new circumstances. At the same time as the above planning, land should also be planned early. Each commune should plant a certain amount of cash crops to avoid imbalances in income between agricultural cooperatives that grow cash crops and those that grow grain crops. To carry out these tasks, it is also necessary to study the issue of merging cooperatives. Roads, cultivated areas, villages, and graves should all be planned. This kind of planning will greatly benefit land conservation.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin said that what needs to be particularly focused on at present is the issue of tool reform and improving labor organization. He said that now, some places are still not paying enough attention to the promotion of tool reform work. This work should also be prepared early. Some places started preparing tools late before the wheat harvest this year, so not many new agricultural tools were used. To increase grain production even more in the future, it will be even more necessary to reform tools. It is certainly good to apply tens of thousands of jin of fertilizer per mu, but how to transport the fertilizer to the field also requires tool reform. In order to quickly carry out this work, localities should not wait to try to manufacture their own. They should take the tools that others have successfully manufactured and copy them. The special zone should take them back to manufacture them and issue a model to each county. Each county should then manufacture them and issue a model to each commune so that each county and commune can manufacture as much as they need. Reform should be carried out in the course of use, so that it will be faster. All new tools should be promoted in this way. He said that the work of tool reform seems to be becoming more and more important, and localities should attach great importance to it. Regarding the issue of labor organization, he believes that some places are good and some places are not. He especially praised the labor organization work of the Sanba Agricultural Cooperative in Sixian County, Bengbu Prefecture. He said that this cooperative organizes production in a very orderly manner, like a factory, without any confusion. Now agricultural production should also be divided into workshops like a factory. There should be those who specialize in corn and those who specialize in rice. Cadres and members should strive to specialize. This is also an important way to speed up the increase in production because specialization allows for constant research, and operations are easy to become skilled in. Field management is contracted to teams, some to groups, and some to households, also for the purpose of dividing labor and doing a better job of field management.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin finally pointed out that if this year's great leap forward in agricultural production can increase China's grain production by more than 20%, then many high yields will eliminate the concept of low yields. The rapid increase in total output will not only frustrate the expectations of the "wait-and-see faction" and the "autumn reckoning faction" at home, but will also make the imperialists tremble in the face of this fact. It can be seen that this is not just a simple economic issue, but also a major political issue, necessary not only for domestic political struggle but also for international political struggle. This rate of increase in production more fully demonstrates the superiority of socialism and the correctness of the general line. This is the application of dialectics, materialism, and the mass line to production and construction, and is a new development of Marxism on the issue of socialist construction. Comrade Tan Zhenlin said that we must bravely move forward and not retreat in the face of difficulties. The leaders of individual places, in the fight against drought, did not try every possible way to fight the drought, but bowed their heads to difficulties, wanting to change paddy fields to dry land and turn high yields into low yields, which is very wrong. He said that as long as we work hard for three years and increase grain production to one thousand jin per person per year nationwide, the grain problem will be solved. Judging from the current situation, some areas can achieve this requirement this year, and the vast majority of areas will achieve this requirement next year. We must be determined to ensure a bumper harvest even if it does not rain for a year; we must also ensure a bumper harvest even if there is a flood like in 1954. We must prepare for the worst and strive for the best.

    今年全国粮食增产二成的指标大有超过的希望
    奋战三年每人每年合粮一千斤
    谭震林同志谈农业跃进的重大意义，对当前农业生产作了重要指示
    要使观潮派秋后算账派的等待落空  要使帝国主义在这个事实面前发抖
    新华社合肥18日电　中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志最近在中共安徽省阜阳地委对当前农业生产作了重要指示。他要求各地深刻认识今年农业大跃进的重大政治意义，在任何情况下都要奋勇前进，力争今年全国粮食增产20％以上。他说，根据他最近在苏北、淮北二十多县视察的情况看来，实现这一增产目标不但可能，还有超过的希望。
    他首先赞扬了淮北人民去冬今春兴修水利，要把淮北水网化，水稻化的雄心。他说，淮北阜阳、蚌埠两专区今年在特别干旱的情况下，仍然能够改种数百万亩水稻，这就证明安徽省委提出的淮北水网化的方针是正确的，证明实行这一方针已经取得很大成绩。
    他说，水网化很好，大沟深塘多，水多，能多改种水稻，庄庄社社能通船，沟沿上再栽三排树，有水有树，整个淮北气候都要改变了。有了树不但能够防风，淮北煤田将来所需要的大量木材，和群众盖房屋用的木材，都能就地解决。淮北有了水网，以后几条新淮河都通到洪泽湖，即可根本解决淮河的水害问题，即可宣布根治淮河的工作告成了。
    谭震林同志发表了他对于淮北、苏北等地农业生产的观感，他认为这些地区群众的干劲很大，领导机关和干部也大都在埋头苦干，彼此竞赛，并且已经摸到了一套领导农业生产的经验，这是今年一个很大的特点。他说，农业发展纲要十二项措施中，现在看来，以下几点特别重要，这就是：水利，肥料，深翻地，改种良种，密植，田间管理，工具改革。他说，关于增加复种指数的问题，要看具体情况进行。关于多种高产作物的问题，现在有些原来认为是低产的作物（如小麦），也已出现了大面积的高额丰产，所以对高产作物也不应该存有固定的看法。他说，要力求把低产作物变成高产作物。
    谭震林同志认为，目前农业生产中应该抓紧解决以下三个问题：一、及早规划的问题，二、工具改革的问题，三、改善劳动组织的问题。关于及早规划的问题，他说，从现在起，就应该规划今年冬天的兴修水利工作了，究竟在这个地区需要蓄多少水，作多少涵闸，修多少道路，都要考虑到，以便10月份很快就可以大干水利。他说，第二个五年计划中要修许多铁路，规划水利时，就要根据这些新情况，研究那些地方要走火车、载重汽车，什么地方要行船。和以上规划同时，对土地也要早作规划，每一个社都要种一定的经济作物，避免种经济作物和种粮食作物农业社之间收入的不平衡。要进行这些工作，还要研究并社的问题。要把道路、耕作区、村庄、坟墓等都作出规划，这种规划，对节省土地将有很大好处。
    谭震林同志说，当前特别要抓的，是工具改革和改善劳动组织的问题。他说，现在，有些地方对工具改革推广工作还是抓得不够紧。这项工作也要及早准备，今年有些地方收麦前，对工具的准备就动手迟了，所以新的农具用的不多。以后要增产更多粮食，就更需要改革工具，每亩要施几万斤肥料当然很好，但是怎样把肥料运到地里，也需要改革工具。为了迅速进行这项工作，各地不应该等待自己试制，应该把别人已试制成功的工具拿来仿制，专区拿回来制造，给每县发一部样子，各县再制造，给每社发一部样子，让各县、社自己需要多少就制造多少，在用的当中再进行改革，这样就快起来了。所有新的工具都应该这样推广。他说，工具改革的工作，看来是愈来愈重要，各地应该把它十分重视起来。关于劳动组织问题，他认为有的地方好，有的地方不好。他特别赞扬了蚌埠专区宿县三八农业社的劳动组织工作。他说，这个社组织生产很有秩序，像工厂一样，一点不乱。现在农业生产，也要像工厂一样分车间了，要有专管玉米的，专管水稻的，干部和社员都要力求专业化。这也是加快增产速度的重要办法。因为专业化，经常研究，操作容易熟练。田间管理有的包到队，有的包到组，有的包到户，也是为了分工，把田间管理工作做得更好。
    谭震林同志最后特别指出，今年农业生产的大跃进，如果能使我国粮食生产提高20％以上，那末，许多高额产量将把低产观念消灭掉，总产量的迅速提高，不但使国内观潮派、秋后算账派的等待落空，而且将使帝国主义在这个事实面前发抖。可见，它不仅仅是简单的经济问题，而且是重大的政治问题，不仅仅是国内政治斗争所必需，而且是国际政治斗争所必需。这种增产速度，就更加充分证明了社会主义的优越性，和总路线的正确性。这是把辩证法、唯物论和群众路线运用到生产建设上，是马克思主义在社会主义建设问题上的新的发展。谭震林同志说，我们要勇敢前进，不要在困难面前退却。有个别地方的领导人，在抗旱斗争中，不是千方百计地想办法和干旱斗争，而是向困难低了头，要把水田改旱地，把高产变低产，这是十分错误的。他说，只要我们苦干三年，粮食增产到全国每人合一千斤，粮食问题就解决了。照现在看来，今年有一部分地区就可以达到这个要求，明年绝大多数地区将达到这个要求。我们要下定决心，一年不下雨也要保证丰收；来了1954年的大水，也要保证丰收。要从最坏的情况作准备，要向最好的目标努力。
