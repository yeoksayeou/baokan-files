Building a Railway on the Qinghai Plateau

The construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway is progressing rapidly. The section from Hekou in Gansu Province to Xining in Qinghai Province will be completed six months ahead of schedule. The Datong River Bridge, one of its key projects—China's largest 213-meter long-span reinforced concrete arch bridge—has completed the concrete pouring of the No. 1 pier, and the No. 2 pier has also started concrete pouring. In Laoya Gorge in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, the railway will pass through six tunnels of various sizes, and this project is also under intense construction.
