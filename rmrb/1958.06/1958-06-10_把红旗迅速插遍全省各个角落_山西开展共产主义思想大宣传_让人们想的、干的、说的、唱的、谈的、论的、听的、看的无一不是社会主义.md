    Quickly Plant Red Flags in Every Corner of the Province:
    Shanxi Launches Large-Scale Propaganda of Communist Ideology
    To ensure people's thoughts, actions, words, songs, discussions, arguments, listening, and seeing are all socialist
    Taiyuan, June 9th (Reporter Feng Jianwei) – The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site conference on propaganda work in Yuncheng Town, Anyi County, in late May. According to the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the spirit of the Eighth National Congress's Second Session, it was decided to carry out large-scale propaganda of communist ideology to quickly plant the red flag of socialism in every corner of the province. At the same time, political and ideological work will be further strengthened to cooperate with the advancement of the technological and cultural revolutions, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of the rectification campaign.

    In order to carry out propaganda work effectively, the conference also summarized and promoted the organizational activity experience of the "Three Schools (Night Party School, Night Communist Youth League School, Spare-time Political School), Three Days (Party Day, League Day, Three Loves Day), One Club (Club), One Room (Exhibition Room)" created by Wuting Village in Wanrong County and Sanluli in Anyi County.

    After conveying and discussing the spirit of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the conference further clarified it, proposing to launch a large-scale movement to universally and deeply carry out propaganda and education work, so that from urban to rural areas, from cadres to the masses, everyone is happy and everyone strives to be the first, to greatly eliminate capitalism and greatly promote socialism, to make capitalism stink and make socialism deeply rooted in people's hearts. People's thoughts, actions, words, songs, discussions, arguments, listening, and seeing, without exception, should be socialist, without exception, should be more, faster, better, and more economical, in order to eliminate classes ideologically and liberate productive forces spiritually. The conference believes that to achieve this, propaganda cadres must first liberate their minds, truly achieve a combination of the abstract and the concrete, using the abstract to drive the concrete, and also correct the direction of work, regularly study the laws of industrial and agricultural production development, regularly gather and study the ideological situation and changes of the people, so that propaganda and education can better serve the central tasks of the Party and serve production and construction. In terms of propaganda and education methods, we must also be good at grasping the political situation, grasping key issues, grasping ideological opposites, grasping good and bad examples, grasping the propaganda team, and grasping motivational slogans, truly achieving accurate grasp, fast response, no omissions in major events, timely promotion of advanced experiences and new things, and fully exerting the role of propaganda and education.

    In order to ensure the proper implementation of the General Line's propaganda and political-ideological education, the conference specially organized an on-site visit to promote the experience of the "Three Schools, Three Days, One Club, One Room" created by Wuting Village in Wanrong County and Sanluli in Anyi County. By adopting this method, the nine propaganda and education organizations can be combined into a whole, and under the guidance of the Party, political-ideological education can be carried out in coordination. It has five major advantages: First, because the "Three Schools" have regular teaching plans and systems, political-ideological education is more systematic and frequent, improving the quality of education and ideology. Second, because the nine organizations are combined into a unified whole, forming a "net" of socialist thought, it facilitates the launch of propaganda movements, so that new ideologies and consciousness quickly form a social atmosphere. Third, because the "Three Schools" and "Three Days" are combined, political-ideological education and daily life inspections and evaluations are closely linked, fully exerting the role of ideological work in promoting central work. Fourth, it is convenient to train and cultivate various talents. Both villages have more than one hundred political instructors, propagandists, writers, art, music, and drama backbone personnel. Fifth, it is simple and easy to implement, does not require spending money on investment, and does not delay production time. It can be promoted in general rural areas, factories, and mines.

    More than 400 people attended the conference, including heads of propaganda departments from local and county Party committees and factory and mine Party committees, as well as news, broadcasting, and publishing cadres. They all learned this set of organizational experience from on-site visits and summary discussions, and immediately formulated plans and arranged promotion steps. Counties such as Xiaxian, Xinjiang, and Anyi have organized thousands of cadres and farmers to visit and study, preparing for widespread promotion.

    把红旗迅速插遍全省各个角落
    山西开展共产主义思想大宣传
    让人们想的、干的、说的、唱的、谈的、论的、听的、看的无一不是社会主义
    本报太原9日电　记者冯建伟报道：中共山西省委5月下旬在安邑县运城镇召开宣传工作现场会议，根据党的社会主义建设总路线和八大二次会议精神，决定开展共产主义思想大宣传，把社会主义的红旗迅速插遍全省各个角落；同时进一步加强政治工作和思想工作，以配合推进技术革命和文化革命，巩固和扩大整风成果。
    为了很好地开展宣传工作，会议还总结推广了万荣县乌停村、安邑县三路里创建的“三校（夜间党校、夜间团校、业余政治学校）、三日（党日、团日、三爱日）、一部（俱乐部）、一室（展览室）”组织活动的经验。
    会议经过传达讨论，进一步明确党的社会主义建设总路线精神，提出开展一个大规模的运动，普遍而深入地进行宣传教育工作，达到从城镇到乡村，从干部到群众，人人心情舒畅，个个奋勇争先，大灭资本主义，大兴社会主义，使资本主义臭不可闻，使社会主义深入人心。人们想的、干的、说的、唱的、谈的、论的、听的、看的，无一不是社会主义，无一不是多快好省，以便从思想上消灭阶级，从精神上解放生产力。会议认为，要做到这一点，宣传工作干部首先要解放思想，切实做到虚实并举，以虚带实，并且端正工作方向，经常研究工农业生产发展规律，经常汇集研究人民群众的思想情况和变化，使宣传教育更好地服务于党的中心任务，服务于生产建设。在宣传教育方法上，还要善于抓政治形势、抓关键问题、抓思想对立面、抓好坏典型、抓宣传队伍、抓鼓动口号，真正作到抓的准、转的快，大事不漏，及时推广先进经验和新的事物，充分发挥宣传教育的作用。
    为了保证作好总路线的宣传和政治思想教育，会议特别组织一次现场参观，推广万荣县乌停村、安邑县三路里创建的“三校、三日、一部、一室”的经验。采用这种办法，可以把九种宣传教育组织结合成一个整体，在党的指导下，协同进行政治思想教育。它有五大好处：一、由于“三校”有正规的教学计划和制度，使政治思想教育更加系统和经常，提高了教育质量和思想性。二、由于九种组织结合成统一的整体，形成一个社会主义思想的“天罗地网”，便利掀起宣传运动，使新的思想意识很快形成一种社会风气。三、由于“三校”、“三日”结合进行，使政治思想教育和日常生活的检查评比紧密联系起来，充分发挥思想工作推动中心工作的作用。四、便于锻炼和培养各种人材。两个村都拥有一百多名政治教员、宣传员、编写、美术、音乐、戏剧工作骨干。五、简单易行，既不需要花钱投资，也不耽误生产时间，一般农村、厂矿都可以推广。
    出席会议的地委、县委、厂矿党委会宣传部负责人和新闻、广播、出版干部四百多人，都从实地参观和座谈总结中学会这套组织经验，当场纷纷制定计划，安排推广步骤。夏县、新绛、安邑等县已组织数千干部和农民前去参观学习，准备普遍推广。
