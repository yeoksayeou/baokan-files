    Indigenous Methods for Preventing Rice Blast
    Recently, continuous rain in the southern rice-growing areas has led to the occurrence of rice blast in some early rice crops. To ensure a good harvest, prevention and control measures must be taken promptly. Currently, the supply of Ceresan, Xilisheng (likely a similar fungicide), and copper sulfate is insufficient. Under these circumstances, utilizing various indigenous methods and local remedies is very important. According to experiences from various regions, the following indigenous methods and local remedies are currently effective:

    I. Cut off the source of pathogens. Rice straw from fields that experienced disease last year must be processed quickly to prevent the dispersal of pathogenic spores.

    II. Mix one part lime powder with two parts wood ash, and sprinkle the mixture on the affected rice paddies at a rate of 50 to 100 jin per mu.

    III. Sprinkle 3 to 5 jin of gypsum powder per mu, or 20 to 40 jin of lime powder per mu. This can prevent rice blast and also improve cold soaked fields.

    IV. Advance the time of field drying and improve irrigation methods. Lianhua and Baishui townships in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, are using the method of drying affected rice fields earlier to control ineffective tillering, strengthen rice stems, and enhance resistance to rice blast.

    土法防治稻热病
    近来南方稻区阴雨连绵，部分早稻已发生稻热病，为保证丰收，必须抓紧防治。目前赛力散、西力生和硫酸铜供应不足。在这种情况下，利用各种土法土药是很重要的。据各地经验，目前行之有效的土法土药有以下几种：
    一、堵绝病菌来源。去年发过病害的稻草，必须赶快进行处理，以免病菌孢子飞散为害。
    二、用石灰粉一份，掺草木灰两份，混合撒在被害稻田里，每亩撒五十至一百斤。
    三、每亩撒石膏粉三斤到五斤，或石灰粉二十斤到四十斤。既能防治稻热病，又能治好冷浸田。
    四、提早烤田和改进灌溉方法。福建省海澄县莲花、白水等乡采用受害稻田提早烤田的办法，控制无效分蘖，使稻茎粗壮，增强对稻热病的抵抗力。
