Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Bonn: The broad masses of the West German public, defying obstruction and persecution by the West German authorities, are continuing to launch a movement against the atomic armament of West Germany.

    Recently, a mass rally protesting atomic armament was held in Duisburg. The well-known West German religious activist, Pastor Niemöller, spoke at the rally, saying that West German atomic armament would lead to an increase in the danger of a new war. He also emphasized that the government's attempt to obstruct a referendum on the issue of atomic armament proves that West Germany has become a police state.

    Six thousand women in Westphalia also held a rally in Münster on the 28th to protest atomic armament. Helene Wessel, a female member of the Social Democratic Party in the Federal Parliament, spoke at the rally, condemning West German militarists and politicians. She said: West German generals and politicians should visit the hospitals in Hiroshima, not the rocket factories in the United States. She also called on the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia to vote in the recent state parliamentary elections to express their opposition to atomic armament.

    In many cities, including Hanover, Braunschweig, Oldenburg, Salzgitter, and Wilhelmshaven, the local organizations of the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom" have requested municipal authorities to hold referendums on the issue of atomic armament. They also called for active opposition to the establishment of atomic weapons and missile bases in West Germany.

    In Hamburg, preparations are actively underway for a referendum on the issue of atomic armament to be held on June 8th.

    Many prominent West German scientists have also published articles and launched signature campaigns against arming West Germany with atomic weapons. Karl Bechert, a famous scientist in Mainz, has already collected more than 13,000 signatures for a petition against atomic armament.

    On the other hand, the Adenauer government is persecuting those who oppose atomic armament. According to reports, a total of 102 citizens in West Germany were arrested in April and May for opposing the Adenauer government's atomic armament policy. Fifty-one of them were sentenced to a total of forty years in prison. Nevertheless, this still cannot prevent the continuous upsurge of the people's movement against atomic armament.

    西德公众不顾政府阻挠和迫害
    继续反对原子武装
    新华社31日讯  波恩消息：西德各地广大群众不顾西德当局的阻挠和迫害，继续展开反对西德原子武装的运动。
    最近在杜伊斯堡举行了抗议原子武装的群众大会，西德著名宗教活动家尼穆勒牧师在大会上发言说，西德的原子武装将会导致新战争危险的增加。他并且着重指出，政府想要阻挠就原子武装问题举行公民投票的企图，证明西德已经变成警察国家。
    威斯特伐利亚的六千名妇女28日在明斯特也举行了抗议原子武装的大会。社会民主党联邦议院女议员海伦妮·威塞尔在大会上讲话，谴责西德军国主义分子和政客。她说：西德的将军和政治家们应当访问的是广岛的医院，而不是美国的火箭制造厂。她并且号召北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的公民们，在最近的州议会选举中投票表示他们反对原子武装的意志。
    在许多城市，其中包括汉诺威、不伦瑞克、奥登堡、萨尔斯吉特、威廉港，“德国人争取统一、和平和自由联盟”的地方组织纷纷要求市政当局就原子武装问题举行公民投票。它们并且呼吁积极反对在西德设置原子武器和建立导弹基地。
    在汉堡，关于在6月8日就原子武装问题举行公民投票的筹备工作正在积极进行。
    西德的许多著名科学家也纷纷发表文章和发起签名运动，反对用原子武器武装西德。仅美因兹的著名科学家卡尔·贝歇尔特就已经为反对原子武装的呼吁书收集了一万三千多人的签名。
    另一方面，阿登纳政府正在迫害反对原子武装的人。据报道，在4、5两个月西德共有一百零二个公民因为反对阿登纳政府的原子武装政策而被捕。其中五十一人被判了总数为四十年的徒刑。尽管如此，仍然不能阻止人民反对原子武装的运动不断高涨。
