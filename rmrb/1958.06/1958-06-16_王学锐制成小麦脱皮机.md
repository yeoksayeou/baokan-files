Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th. Wang Xuerui, a 57-year-old worker in Jinan City, has made a wheat peeling machine, pioneering an advanced flour milling method of removing bran first. This is a major technological innovation in the wheat milling industry.

　　Wang Xuerui is a worker at the Jinan Chengji Flour Mill, a joint state-private enterprise. After the wheat peeling machine he trial-produced was put into production, the wheat flour yield increased from an average of 87+ jin of flour per 100 jin of wheat to 92+ jin; moreover, the flour color is whiter than that of unpeeled wheat, and the nutritional content is also higher. What is even more valuable is that it can make production free from the limitations of natural conditions.

　　Wang Xuerui had heard that a flour mill in Zhangjiakou had experimented with grinding wheat after peeling it, so he requested a trial, which was supported by the factory's Party organization and the public representative. However, to peel the wheat first, there must be a peeling machine, but such a machine did not exist, and everything had to be explored by himself. At that time, the factory's technicians believed that "this is unthinkable." But Wang Xuerui insisted on experimenting. In April 1954, he and some other workers, with the support of the Provincial Cooperative, installed five wheat peeling machines for continuous production trials, but the large amount of wet bran produced was not only prone to mold but also prone to fire. The original "wait-and-see faction" said: "I don't think it will work. The United States has been researching it for more than ten years without success." Wang Xuerui disagreed with this statement. He believed: If foreigners don't succeed in their research, does that mean we can't succeed? He was determined and, with everyone's help, after more than fifty large and small trials, he finally succeeded in the trial production.

### 王学锐制成小麦脱皮机

    王学锐制成小麦脱皮机
    新华社济南15日电　济南市一位五十七岁的老工人王学锐，制成小麦脱皮机，首创小麦先出麸皮的先进制粉法。这是小麦制粉业中一项重大的技术革新。
    王学锐是公私合营济南成记面粉厂的工人，他试制的小麦脱皮机投入生产以后，小麦出粉率由平均每百斤出八十七斤多面粉提高到九十二斤多；而且粉色比不脱皮的洁白，营养成份也高。更可贵的是，它能使生产不受自然条件的限制。
    王学锐过去听说张家口一个面粉厂曾经试验过小麦脱皮后磨粉，于是他提出要求试验，得到了工厂党组织和公方代表的支持。但是要小麦先脱皮，就必须有脱皮的机器，而这种机器现在还没有，要全靠自己摸索。当时厂里的技术人员认为“这是不能设想的事情”。但王学锐坚持试验。1954年4月，他和其他一些工人在省合作总社的支持下，安装了五部小麦脱皮机进行连续性的生产试验，但生产出来的大批湿麸皮，不仅容易霉烂，而且容易起火。原来的“观潮派”就说：“我看就是不行，美国研究了十几年还没有成功。”王学锐不同意这种说法，他认为：外国人研究不成功，我们就不能成功吗？他抱定志气，在大家的帮助下，经过五十多次大小试验，最后终于试制成功。
