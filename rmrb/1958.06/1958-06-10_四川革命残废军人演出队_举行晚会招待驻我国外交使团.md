Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The spare-time performance troupe of the Sichuan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Convalescent Institute held an evening performance at the CPPCC Auditorium tonight to entertain various diplomatic missions to China.

The nineteen programs performed by the disabled veterans today were warmly welcomed by the guests. The guests especially loved the table tennis performance by Huang Tianran, who had both hands amputated, and Yi Ruyuan, who had only one hand. Huang Tianran used the stumps of his amputated arms to hold the racket and play with Yi Ruyuan. He could continuously smash and block with exceptional bravery. During the performance, Yi Ruyuan often could not withstand Huang Tianran's continuous offensive and lost the ball. The result of the performance was twenty-one to eighteen, Huang Tianran winning over Yi Ruyuan.

After the performance, the diplomatic missions presented flower baskets to the disabled veterans and gifted them an accordion.

    四川革命残废军人演出队
    举行晚会招待驻我国外交使团
    新华社9日讯　四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队今晚在政协礼堂举行演出晚会，招待驻我国各外交使团。
    残废军人们今天演出的十九个节目，都受到了客人们的热烈欢迎。客人们特别喜爱切去双手的黄天然和独手易如元的乒乓球表演。黄天然用切去双手的残肢夹着球拍和易如元打球，他能连抽连扣，异常勇猛。在表演中，易如元常抵挡不住黄天然的连续进攻而输了球。表演结果是二十一比十八，黄天然胜了易如元。
    演出结束后，外交使团向残废军人们献花篮，并赠送手风琴。
