Cowherd and Fitter-Turned-College Student Dong Tingzong

Creates Centripetal Oscillating Lapping Machine

Dong Tingzong, a Tsinghua University student who was a cowherd and a fitter, created the "centripetal oscillating lapping machine" during his internship at the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory, solving the old problem of the inner sleeve grinding accuracy of tapered bearings failing to meet requirements. On June 14, the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory had already manufactured nine lathes based on Dong Tingzong's design and put them into production.

This semester, Dong Tingzong was assigned to the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory for graduation practice. The factory's inner sleeve grinding accuracy had long failed to meet national standards, affecting the life of the bearings, and many experts felt it was "tricky." They had also proposed many methods, but none had solved the problem. Dong Tingzong was immediately attracted to this problem. After observation and research, he boldly proposed to improve the machine, replacing the original polishing machine with a centripetal oscillating lapping machine, and replacing the emery cloth with an oilstone. This suggestion received the active support of the workshop leadership. Therefore, he further carefully studied the grinding machine pressure, lubrication level, and machine running round-trip time, etc. During the day, production tasks were very tight and various tests could not be carried out, so he used the production gaps at night to test. Dong Tingzong was a fitter and had a particularly close relationship with the workers. During his experiment, he received the most enthusiastic support and help from his worker comrades. After two months of hard work, Dong Tingzong finally created the "centripetal oscillating lapping machine." After testing, the new machine has the following advantages: First, the physical properties of the inner sleeve of the ground bearing fully meet the requirements; Second, the surface finish is increased from the past eight or nine grades to eleven grades, meeting national requirements; Third, the grinding speed is reduced from one minute and forty-five seconds to forty seconds, improving efficiency by more than one time; Fourth, the past rework rate was 30%–50%, but now there is no rework; Fifth, the state no longer has to use foreign exchange to buy machines from abroad.

    放牛娃和车工出身的大学生董廷宗
    创造向心式摆动精研机
    放牛娃和车工出身的清华大学学生董廷宗，在哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂实习中，创造了“向心式摆动精研机”，解决了圆锥型轴承内套研磨精度上达不到要求的老问题。6月14日，哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂已根据董廷宗的设计，制造出九台车床，投入生产。
    这学期，董廷宗被分配到哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂进行毕业实习。这个厂轴承内套研磨精度长期达不到国家的标准，影响轴承的寿命，许多专家都感到“棘手”，他们也提出过不少办法，但都没有解决问题。董廷宗一开始就被这个问题吸引着。他经过观察研究后，就大胆提出要改进机器，用向心式摆动精研机代替原来的抛光机，用油石代替砂布，这个建议得到了车间领导上的积极支持。于是他进一步细心地研究了磨床压力、润滑程度，机床运行往返时间等。白天生产任务很紧张，不能进行各种试验，他就利用夜间生产空隙去试验。董廷宗是车工出身，和工人的关系特别密切，在他试验过程中，得到工人同志们最热心的支持和帮助。经过两个月的艰苦奋斗，董廷宗终于创造出“向心式摆动精研机”，经过试验，新机器有下面几个优点：一，研磨后的轴承，内套物理性能完全合乎要求；二，表面光洁度由过去的八、九级提高到十一级，达到国家的要求；三，研磨速度由一分四十五秒缩短到四十秒，提高效率一倍多；四，过去返修品有30％—50％，现在没有返修；五，不再用国家外汇向国外买机器。
