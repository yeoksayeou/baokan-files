    Do a Good Job of Planting Rice After Wheat
    This year, among the newly developed rice crops in northern provinces, rice planted after wheat accounts for a large proportion.

    Rice planted after wheat can only be transplanted after the wheat harvest. The early frost in the north means that the timing of transplanting has a decisive impact on yield. Striving for early transplanting, without violating the farming season, is the primary link in planting rice after wheat well.

    Because rice planted after wheat can only be transplanted after the wheat harvest, and the growing period in the paddy field is shorter, applying more base fertilizer and early top dressing to promote early and rapid growth is another important link in planting rice after wheat well. Last year, the Xin Yuanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, applied more fertilizer to improve the soil fertility in the previous crop field on its 553 mu of rice planted after wheat. Before transplanting, 2,000 jin of base fertilizer were applied per mu, and 20 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied as top dressing 7 or 8 days after transplanting, resulting in an average yield of 690 jin per mu. If more fertilizer is applied, the yield can obviously be greatly increased.

    Another important link in planting rice after wheat well is to achieve rational close planting. Last year, the Wangzhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County, Hebei Province, achieved a yield of more than 700 jin per mu, which was not lower than the yield of spring rice. One of the main experiences was to implement close planting. Because rice planted after wheat is transplanted relatively late, and the tillering in the paddy field is less, implementing close planting can make up for the lack of tillering and ensure yield. Therefore, as long as we firmly grasp the key points of close planting, early transplanting, and sufficient fertilizer application, the bumper harvest of rice planted after wheat is completely assured.

    Doing a good job of planting rice after wheat requires all localities to strengthen specific organizational leadership, make reasonable arrangements for labor and livestock, determine plots, and make plans for repairing small hills, canals, and field ridges. When the wheat is yellow and the grains are full, harvest one or two ridges in advance and build the larger field ridges first. The fertilizer required for the paddy fields should be delivered to the edges of the fields before the wheat harvest. After the wheat is harvested, spread manure, plow the land, build ridges, release water, level the ground, and transplant the seedlings immediately, so as to harvest one piece and transplant one piece, and strive to transplant one mu as early as possible. Every day earlier is a good day.

### 种好麦茬稻

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

    种好麦茬稻
    今年北方各省新发展的水稻中，麦茬稻比重很大。
    麦茬稻要在麦收后才能插秧。北方霜期较早，插秧迟早对产量有决定性影响。力争早插，不违农时，是种好麦茬稻的首要环节。
    由于麦茬稻在麦收后才能插秧，本田生育期较短，因此，多施基肥，早施追肥，促使早发快长，是种好麦茬稻的另一个重要环节，去年河北省宁河县新袁庄农业社五百五十三亩麦茬稻，在前作田中，多施了肥料，培养了地力；插秧前每亩施用了基肥二千斤，插秧后七、八天，随即又追施硫酸铵二十斤，就获得了平均亩产六百九十斤的产量。如果进一步增施肥料，显然还可以大大提高产量。
    种好麦茬稻的再一个重要环节是必须要做到合理密植。去年河北省文安县王庄子农业社得到了亩产七百多斤的收成，不低于春稻产量，主要经验之一就是实行密植。因为麦茬稻插植较迟，本田分蘖较少，实行密植就可补分蘖之不足，保证产量。所以，只要紧紧抓住密植、早插、施足肥料几个关键，麦茬稻的丰收是完全有把握的。
    种好麦茬稻要求各地加强具体的组织领导，作好劳畜力的合理安排，确定地块，作好修整田间小丘、毛渠、田埂等计划，到麦黄粒实的时候，提前收割一二垅，把比较大的田埂先行筑好。稻田所需肥料，应在麦收前就送到田边地角。小麦收获后，应即铺粪，耕地，筑埂，放水，平地，插秧，做到收一块，插一块，争取早插一亩是一亩，早插一天好一天。
