How the "Rape King" is Cultivated
    Tian Kang

    A "Rape King" was discovered in the high-yield rapeseed field of the Baishuitang Cooperative, Dalukou Township, Songzi County, Hubei Province. Its stalk was as thick as a wine glass, bearing more than 4,160 robust and full pods, yielding at least four liang of rapeseed. This "Rape King" has aroused great interest. However, amidst the good news of a widespread rapeseed harvest this year, reports of "Rape Kings," "Rape Trees," and "Rape Emperors" have emerged from various locations. Judging by the number of pods and the yield per plant, these "Rape Kings" seem to be competing with each other. A "Rape King" in Xinghua had 4,700 pods; a "Rape King" in Zhenfeng County, Guizhou, had over 18,400 pods; and a large rapeseed plant in Zhong County, Sichuan, far exceeded the previous two, reaching over 50,000 pods. Naturally, there was also competition in yield: 8.3 qian, 15.8 qian, 1 jin, 1.2 jin, and 6.13 jin.

    The abundance of "Rape Kings" appearing this year is unprecedented. It is rare for a plant of the cruciferous family, such as rapeseed, to yield so many seeds from a single plant. Although the origins of these "Rape Kings" differ, they share some common characteristics: generally, more attention is paid to planting techniques. The owner of the Songzi "Rape King" said, "I applied more fertilizer when topdressing it." The "Rape King" in Yilong, Sichuan, which yielded 1.2 jin of rapeseed, was sown ten to fifteen days earlier than ordinary rapeseed; the land for planting was dug deep, harrowed finely, and had sufficient base fertilizer applied; topdressing, inter-tillage, and weeding were also well-managed. The "Rape King" in Zhong County, Sichuan, grew on a garbage heap next to the Jinji Township Grain Station and sprouted more than half a month earlier than ordinary rapeseed. In terms of field management, when this rapeseed plant grew to over a chi tall, the cadres of the grain station topdressed it every twenty days or so and cultivated and earthed it up, doing this five times in total.

    What do these facts tell us? They tell us that only careful cultivation can fully unlock the potential for increased rapeseed production. In cultivating this crop, can it also be said: there are no bad rapeseed plants, only bad cultivation techniques.

    The high yield per plant of these "Rape Kings" is inseparable from their numerous branches and pods. Ordinary rapeseed plants only have three to four branches, with no more than twenty pods on each branch, yielding just over 1.6 qian of seeds, requiring one hundred plants to yield one jin of rapeseed. In contrast, "Rape Kings" have at least fifty branches or more, with thousands of pods. Therefore, the yield per plant of some "Rape Kings" can equal the yield of a hundred ordinary rapeseed plants.

    "Rape Kings" not only bring us many rapeseeds but also provide us with valuable experiences in achieving high yields. Summarizing the experience of cultivating "Rape Kings" is something that every region where "Rape Kings" appear should seize upon.

### “油菜王”是怎样培育的

    “油菜王”是怎样培育的
    田康
    湖北松滋县大路口乡白水淌社的油菜丰产田中发现了一株“油菜王”，它的茎秆有酒杯粗，生有四千一百六十多个粗壮饱满的荚果，至少能收四两菜子。这株“油菜王”引起了人们极大的兴趣。但在今年油菜普遍丰收的喜讯中，各地又传来不少出现“油菜王”“油菜树”以及“油菜大王”的消息。从这些“油菜王”的果荚数目、单株产量看，它们之间似乎在比赛。兴化一株“油菜王”有四千七百个果荚；贵州贞丰县一株“油菜王”有一万八千四百多个荚果；四川忠县一株大油菜的荚果又远远超过前面的两个，达到五万多个。在产量上自然也有一番竞争：八两三钱，十五两八钱，一斤，一斤二两，六斤十三两。
    今年各地出现的“油菜王”如此之多是从来没有过的。像油菜这种十字花科的植物，单株收获这样多的种子，确是少有的现象。尽管“油菜王”的出处不同，但是却有一些共同的特点：在种植技术上一般比较讲究。松滋油菜王的主人说：“在追肥的时候给它多施了肥料”。四川仪陇收一斤二两菜籽的“油菜王”的播种期比一般油菜早十到十五天；种油菜的地挖得深、耙得细、施足了底肥；追肥、中耕、除草也搞得很好。四川忠县的“油菜王”是生长在金鸡乡粮站旁的垃圾堆上，比一般油菜早出土半个多月。在田间管理上，这棵油菜长到一尺多高的时候，粮站的干部每隔二十多天就追肥一次，中耕培土一次，前后进行了五次之多。
    这些事实告诉我们什么呢？它告诉我们，只有精细的培植，才能充分挖掘油菜增产的潜力。在培育这项作物上，是不是也可以这样说：没有不良的油菜，只有不良的栽培技术。
    这些“油菜王”的单株产量高，是和它们的分枝多、荚果多分不开的。一般油菜只有三到四个分枝，每个分枝上不过二十多个果荚，种子不过一钱六，这样就要一百株油菜才能收一斤菜子。而“油菜王”，最少有五十个以上的分枝，几千个荚果。因此有些“油菜王”的单株产量，能顶百株一般油菜的产量。
    “油菜王”不仅给我们带来很多的菜子，而且给我们带来宝贵的丰产经验。总结培育“油菜王”的经验，是每个出现“油菜王”地区应当抓紧的事情。
