Promote Collectivism to Solve Key Production Problems
Guangzhou's Three Districts Hold Production Collaboration Conference

(Our dispatch) Guangzhou City's North, Central, and South districts recently held district-wide production collaboration conferences in the form of "Chèn Xū" (similar to Northern China's country fair or temple fair) for industrial and commercial enterprises. Through these conferences, the spirit of collectivism of mutual support was further promoted, solving many practical difficulties and key production problems that had been difficult to resolve for a long time in many units, and achieving more extensive and closer collaboration than in the past.

In the previous period, the factories and enterprises in these three districts had organized various forms of collaboration, which played a positive role in the common Great Leap Forward. However, because the scope of this collaboration was small, many problems that could have been solved could not be resolved satisfactorily. At the same time, many units cleared out a lot of stockpiled and surplus materials during the Double-Anti Movement, a large part of which could not be handled by the unit itself or the industry. However, some units urgently needed these materials. Therefore, general collaboration meetings could no longer meet the needs of various units, and it was necessary to create a more lively and dynamic district-wide production collaboration. "Chèn Xū" is a good way to achieve this grand collaboration.

The method of the "Chèn Xū" collaboration conference is led by the district committee, requiring all units to promote the communist spirit of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me," and to set up "market stalls" with physical samples, charts, material lists, or big-character posters of their stockpiled and surplus materials and things that can support other units. Those requesting support also make proposals in the "market stalls" with big-character posters or broadcasts. After seeing these samples and big-character posters, the people "Chèn Xū" will register and link up according to the needs of their units. Then, through borrowing, giving, lending, and exchanging, they achieve the purpose of mutual exchange, mutual support, and making the best use of everything. The district committee has a management agency in the "market stalls" to be responsible for the leadership.

The characteristics of this "Chèn Xū" collaboration conference are short time and great results, which enabled the relevant units to establish more extensive collaborative relationships. The North District's "Chèn Xū" conference lasted only two days, and 498 factories (communes, stores) established collaborative relationships. The Central District opened for four days, and more than 200 units had 463 collaborations. In the South District, more than 100 factories and many units outside the district were also involved in the collaboration boom.

Through this widespread collaboration, many units were helped to solve many practical difficulties and key production problems that had been unresolved for a long time. The Victory Toothbrush Factory in the North District had a 7.5 horsepower motor that had been unused for a long time, while the Guangzhou Wire Factory had stopped three machines due to lack of power. This "Chèn Xū" solved the problem. Many units supported others and solved their own difficulties; some units exchanged stockpiled materials for urgently needed equipment, solving production difficulties; some units purchased more than a dozen or twenty kinds of goods in one "Chèn Xū"; and some units found a way out for goods that had been stockpiled for a long time and considered hopeless.

This "Chèn Xū" collaboration conference was warmly welcomed by all units. It deeply embodies the communist spirit of mutual help and mutual support. (Yang Wenquan)

### 发扬集体主义精神　解决生产关键问题  广州三个区开生产协作大会

    发扬集体主义精神　解决生产关键问题
    广州三个区开生产协作大会
    本报讯　广州市北区、中区和南区的工业、商业企业最近分别以“趁墟”（即北方的赶集、庙会）的形式，举行了全区性的生产协作大会。通过这种大会，进一步发扬了互相支援的集体主义精神，解决了许多单位长时间难以解决的实际困难和生产关键问题，实现了比过去更广泛更密切的协作。
    这三个区的工厂企业在前一时间曾组织过多种形式的协作，对共同大跃进起了良好作用。但是，由于这种协作范围较小，许多可能解决的问题不能得到圆满的解决。同时，许多单位在双反运动中清理出不少积压和多余的物资，有很大一部分本单位、本行业无法处理，可是，有些单位却正迫切需要这种物资。因此，一般的协作会议已不能满足各单位的需要，必须创造一种更生动更活泼的全区性生产大协作，“趁墟”正是这种大协作的好办法。
    “趁墟”协作大会的作法，是由区委领导，要求各单位发扬“我为人人、人人为我”的共产主义精神，将本单位积压、多余的物资和能够支援其他单位的东西，用实物样品、图表、物资清单或大字报组成“墟场”，要求支援的也用大字报或广播等办法在“墟场”上提出。“趁墟”的人们看了这些样品、大字报之后，根据本单位的需要，进行登记挂钩，然后，通过借用、赠送、借让和交换使用等办法，达到互通有无、互相支援、物尽其用的目的。区委在“墟场”设有管理机构，负责领导。
    这种“趁墟”协作大会的特点是时间短、收效大，使有关单位建立了更加广泛的协作关系。北区“趁墟”大会只开了两天，便有四百九十八个厂（社、店）建立了协作关系。中区开了四天，有二百多单位发生了四百六十三次协作关系。南区也有一百多家工厂和区外的许多单位卷入了协作的热潮。
    经过这种广泛的协作，帮助不少单位解决了许多长期无法解决的实际困难和生产关键。北区胜利牙刷厂有一部七匹半马力的马达长期用不上，而广州电线厂却因缺乏动力停了三部机器，这次“趁墟”解决了这个问题。许多单位既支援了别人，又解决了自己的困难；有些单位还用积压物资换回了自己急需的设备，解决了生产困难；有的单位“趁墟”一次就认购了十几二十样的货物；还有些单位长期积压认为没有出路的货物，这次也找到了出路。
    这种“趁墟”协作大会受到了各单位的热烈欢迎，它深刻的体现了互相帮助、互相支援的共产主义精神。　（杨文全）
