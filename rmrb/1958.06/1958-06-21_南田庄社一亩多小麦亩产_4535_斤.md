Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th: Eight production teams from six agricultural cooperatives – Mengzhuang Township, Nantianzhuang, Xixiafeng, Liangcun, Xucun, and Houcun – in Huixian County, Henan Province, have all set high yield records for wheat. These eight teams have a total of 9.69 mu of high-yield wheat fields, with an actual yield of 42,341.25 jin of wheat, averaging 4,369.9 jin per mu. Among them, the No. 3 team of the Nantianzhuang Agricultural Cooperative had the highest yield, averaging 4,535.25 jin per mu on its 1.59 mu of wheat field, surpassing the high-yield record of the Shuanglou Cooperative in Shangqiu County by 123 jin. The Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and the Huixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent people to these high-yield areas several times to measure the land, verify the yield, and convened symposiums with the workers and commune members who were involved in the harvesting, transportation, threshing, weighing, and storage processes, proving the yield to be accurate. Gu Zhanxi, Secretary of the Huixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Deputy Secretaries Dong Sixiao and Lin Ziyu, and County Head Xi Guanghua personally went to congratulate them and helped summarize the experience of achieving high yields.

    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省辉县孟庄乡、南田庄、西夏峰、梁村、徐村、侯村等六个农业社的八个生产队，都创造了小麦高额丰产纪录。这八个队共有高额丰产小麦九点六九亩，实产小麦四万二千三百四十一斤四两，平均亩产四千三百六十九斤九两。其中，南田庄社第三队一点五九亩麦田的产量最高，平均亩产四千五百三十五斤四两，比商丘县双楼社的丰产纪录高出一百二十三斤。中共新乡地委、辉县县委都曾经分别派人到这些丰产地数次丈量土地，核算产量，并召开了收割、运麦、打场、过秤、保管等工序经手人和社员座谈会，证明产量属实。中共辉县县委书记谷占喜，副书记董思孝、林子玉，县长席光华等亲自前往祝贺，并帮助总结了丰产经验。
