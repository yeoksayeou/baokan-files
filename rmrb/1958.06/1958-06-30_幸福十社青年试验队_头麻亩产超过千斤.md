Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The ramie high-yield field of the Youth Experiment Team of the Happiness Tenth Commune in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, harvested 1,510 jin from one mu and four fen and six li of first-season ramie, averaging over 1,034 jin per mu. This is more than 225 jin more than the national ramie record of 808.8 jin per mu for the total yield of the first, second, and third harvests achieved last year by the Changjiang First Commune in Daye County, Hubei.

When the first harvest of ramie was reaped from this one mu, four fen, and six li high-yield plot, the work teams from the Huanggang Prefectural Committee and the Yangxin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party participated in the actual yield verification. According to measurements, the ramie stalks in this high-yield field were 6.5 to 7.4 feet tall, with a waist circumference of 2 to 2.5 inches. There were 1,450 clumps per mu, averaging 21.2 roots per clump, with the largest clumps having more than 40 roots. Under normal circumstances, about 70 roots are needed to produce one jin of hemp, but in this plot, only 28 to 30 roots are needed to produce one jin of hemp, with the highest and thickest roots yielding 1.04 taels of hemp each.

This high-yield plot is located in the small hills of white clay soil and is an old hemp field. The commune members of the Youth Experiment Team achieved this high-yield record under the guidance of Cheng Baoguo, a model agricultural worker in Hubei Province, and after learning from the advanced experience of Chen Senmao, a national model worker in ramie cultivation.

Recently, this Youth Experiment Team, through studying the General Line and summarizing the experience of the first ramie harvest, has become even more motivated and is striving to double the yield of the second harvest compared to the first. Inspired and spurred on by them, the local masses are also striving to realize a "thousand-jin ramie township."

    头麻亩产超过千斤
    据新华社讯　湖北阳新县幸福十社青年试验队的苎麻丰产田里，有一亩四分六厘头季苎麻收了一千五百一十斤，平均亩产一千零三十四斤多。这比去年湖北大冶县长江一社头、二、三麻总计亩产八百零八点八斤的全国苎麻最高产量还多二百二十五斤多。
    这一亩四分六厘高额丰产苎麻，在收割头麻时，中共黄冈地委和阳新县委工作组参加了实打验收。据测量，这块丰产地里苎麻秆高六点五尺到七点四尺，秆的腰围粗达二寸到二寸半。每亩有一千四百五十蔸，平均每蔸二十一点二根，最大的蔸有四十多根。通常情况，要七十根左右才能打一斤麻，但这块地只二十八根到三十根便能打麻一斤，最高最粗的每根打麻一点零四两。
    这块丰产地是白泥土质的小丘陵地，是老麻地。青年试验队的社员们是在湖北省农业劳动模范程保国指导下，又学习了全国苎麻劳动模范陈森茂的先进经验后，才获得这个高额丰产纪录的。
    最近，这个青年试验队通过学习总路线，总结了头麻丰产经验，干劲更大，争取二麻产量比头麻翻一番。当地群众在他们的鼓舞和带动下，也正在力争实现苎麻千斤乡。
