Creating New Farm Tools: Shoulder Pole Transformed into Cableway, Fertilizer Flies by Plane
Hunan's 70,000 Handicraft Workers Vigorously Engage in Tool Reform
Shanghai's Handicraft Industry Marches Towards Mechanization, Becoming a Powerful Assistant to Large-Scale Industry

(By our reporter Huang Yubai) Hunan Province's more than 3,000 iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft cooperatives and groups that directly serve agricultural production have become an important force in the agricultural technology revolution.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the province had more than 72,000 handicraft workers who provided more than 7,500 creations and inventions for farm tool reform, trial-produced and modified more than 400 kinds of new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, and also supplied rural areas with more than 24.6 million pieces of various new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools.

Since the first quarter of this year, iron, wood, and bamboo cooperatives in various parts of Hunan that directly serve agricultural production have launched a new upsurge of creating new farm tools and reforming old farm tools on the basis of deeply carrying out rectification and consolidation. Pingjiang County, by adopting methods such as technical exchanges, visiting old farmers, on-site visits and appraisals, and training technical workers, has produced 87 kinds of new-style plows, 18 kinds of fertilizer-making tools, 30 kinds of farm tools such as manure spreaders and rice planting boxes, 24 kinds of agricultural and sideline product processing tools, and 16 kinds of rain-proof tools—almost everything that runs on the road, is used in the fields, moves in the water, or drills in the mountains. It is estimated that the promotion of these new products can save farmers 6 million labor days throughout the year, and also save more than 2.4 million yuan in investment in farm tools and fertilizers. The Jianjiang sheet metal production group in Dao County trial-produced a simple water pump, which is simple in structure and suitable for irrigating high-slope fields, increasing efficiency by two times compared with ordinary water pumps. Zhou Yunjie, a member of the Longxi Woodware Cooperative in Xinshao County, relying only on a saw and axe, and after five experiments and modifications, successfully trial-produced an aerial fertilizer transport cableway. This cableway, operated by two people, can transport 500 dan of fertilizer down the mountain from a height of 500 meters every day. During the busy spring plowing and fertilizer transport period, all twelve counties in the entire area widely promoted this new creation. The masses reflected: "The People's Government is really good, fertilizer flies by plane, the shoulder pole is replaced by a cableway, and the fertilizer that our ancestors never got their hands on has now been taken down."

At present, while seizing the opportunity to support the great leap forward in agriculture, handicraft workers across the province are carrying out technological innovation in the handicraft industry itself. Some handicraft cooperatives and groups have initially realized the transition from manual operation to semi-mechanized and mechanized production in the reform of old tools and the creation of new tools.

(By our correspondent) In Shanghai, more than 75% of the 220 hardware, ironware, and other handicraft cooperative organizations have achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of the production process. At present, they are manufacturing more than 1,000 kinds of machine parts, equipment, and small machine tools for large factories, becoming a powerful assistant to large-scale industry.

These handicraft cooperative members were mostly individual handicraft laborers such as coppersmiths and blacksmiths in the past, and generally only had small tools such as hammers and files. After collectivization, relying on the funds accumulated through their own production and development, the cooperative organizations have more than 4,800 machine tools and electrical equipment, transitioning from manual operation to machine production. Most of the machine equipment they own was replaced by large factories.

Handicraft workers are very enthusiastic about realizing the mechanization of production. Some cooperatives use old tools and old materials to piece together and assemble machines. Sand casting, iron forging, and machine manufacturing cooperatives cooperate with each other to produce simple machine equipment; if there are no drawings, they go to factories to copy and imitate. Many old machines that were originally scrapped by industrial departments have also been transformed into useful equipment through their skillful hands.

Due to the improvement of the degree of mechanization, the production appearance of these handicraft cooperative organizations has greatly changed. The cooperatives in the sheet metal and black iron industries have changed from manufacturing ordinary household watering cans to producing blowers, machine guards, and transformer iron shells needed by industrial departments, and some have also undertaken the production of small boilers. This year, some cooperatives and cooperative factories with stronger technical strength and larger scale have also begun to manufacture more than ten kinds of machinery with higher technical requirements, such as small lathes, sawing machines, planers, electric drills, and electric motors, for small and medium-sized factories and handicraft cooperatives in Shanghai and other places.

### 创造新农具　扁担改索道　肥料坐飞机  湖南七万手工业工人大搞工具改革  上海手工业向机械化迈进成为大工业的有力助手

    创造新农具　扁担改索道　肥料坐飞机
    湖南七万手工业工人大搞工具改革
    上海手工业向机械化迈进成为大工业的有力助手
    本报讯　记者黄驭白报道：湖南省三千多个直接为农业生产服务的铁、木、竹手工业社、组，已成为农业技术革命中的一支重要力量。
    据不完全统计，今年第一季度全省即有七万二千多个手工业工人为农具改革提供了七千五百多项创造发明，试制、改制新式农具、农械和农副产品加工工具等四百多种，同时还供应了农村各种新式农具、农械和农副产品加工工具等二千四百六十余万件。
    今年第一季度以来，湖南各地直接为农业生产服务的铁、木、竹业合作社在深入开展整风、整社的基础上，掀起了一个创造新农具、革新旧农具的新高潮。平江县由于采取技术交流、访问老农和实地参观评比以及培训技术工人等办法，制成了各种新式犁八十七种，造肥工具十八种，散粪、插秧箱等农具三十种，农副产品加工工具二十四种，避雨工具十六种，几乎是路上跑的，田里使的，水里动的，山上钻的，应有尽有。据估计，这些新产品的推广，全年可为农民节省六百万个劳动日，还能节约农具和肥料投资二百四十余万元。道县道江白铁生产小组试制的简易抽水机，结构简单，适用于高坡田的灌溉，较一般水泵工效提高二倍。新邵县龙溪木器社社员周云阶只凭锯子斧头，经过五次试验修改，试制空中运肥索道成功。这种索道用两个人操作，可以从五百公尺的高山上，每天运五百担肥料下山。在春耕运肥紧张时期，全专区十二个县都普遍推广了这个新的创造。群众反映：“人民政府真正好，肥料坐飞机，扁担换索道，祖辈手上没拿到手的肥料，这次也取下来了。”
    目前全省手工业工人正在抓住支援农业跃进的同时，进行手工业本身的技术革新。部分手工业社、组在改革旧工具、创造新工具中，已经初步实现了由手工操作到半机械化、机械化的生产。
    本报讯　上海市二百二十个五金、铁器等手工业合作组织，生产过程机械化和半机械化的已经占到75％以上。目前，他们正在为大工厂制造一千多种机器零件、设备和小型工作母机，成为大工业的有力助手。
    这些手工业社的社员，过去大都是铜匠、铁匠等个体手工业劳动者，一般只有一些鎯头、锉刀等小工具。合作化以后，他们依靠自己生产发展积累起来的资金，使合作组织拥有四千八百多台机床和电机设备，从手工操作走向机器生产。他们拥有的机器设备中，大部分是大工厂替换下来的。
    手工业工人对实现生产机械化的劲头很大。有些社利用旧工具、旧材料拼拼凑凑装配机器。翻砂、锻铁和机械制造等合作社相互协作，生产简单的机器设备；没有图样，就到工厂中去描摹仿造。许多旧机器原来在工业部门已经超龄报废，经过他们巧妙的双手，也变成了有用的装备。
    由于机械化程度的提高，这些手工业合作组织的生产面貌大大改变。白铁和黑铁行业的合作社，由原来制造普通家庭用的洒水壶，改变为生产工业部门需要的鼓风机、机器防护罩、变压器铁壳，有的还承制小型的锅炉。今年，部分技术力量较强和规模较大的合作社和合作工厂，还开始为上海和外地的中小型工厂与手工业社制造小型车床、锯床、刨床、电钻和电动机等十多种技术要求较高的机械。
