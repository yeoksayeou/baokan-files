Twenty Years Later: Ode to the Reservoir
——Finale Interlude from "The Ballad of the Miyun Reservoir"
Tian Han

    I
  　The East is Red, the sun rises, we drive to visit the Thirteen Tombs. Twenty years ago, this was just a village, the Wenyu River overgrown with weeds, rocks, and withered vines. Since Chairman Mao built the reservoir, a hundred thousand leaping heroes rival the roc. During the day, they sweat under the sun like rain, at night, they rely on a network of mercury lamps. They compete tirelessly with the floods, completing the highest layer of the dam in just a few months. Even though the age-old dragons are disobedient, they cannot resist this copper-sinewed, iron-boned binding rope, giving us this wind-blown lake with rippling silk. Oh, rippling silk.
    II
  　Midday, the shade is dense, young men and women and children have arrived. In the past, the Shou Mountain was the emperor's tomb in spring, but today we visit the cherry valley and the Youth Palace. And the spring wine in the vineyard is ripe, the wine banners are red beside the apricot blossom village. (Spoken) Have you heard the old grandpa say? (Sung) The old man bound the blade to slay the evil python, the village woman drew her knife to kill the monstrous dragon, but how can they compare to the hundred thousand heroes, who moved mountains and seas to seize the work of heaven, one hundred and twenty kilowatts of electricity is a great achievement, three hundred thousand mu of fertile land yields an abundant harvest. One million two hundred thousand catties of fish and shrimp are inexhaustible, and there is also the moon and clear breeze that cost not a penny, we are all endlessly happy here. Oh, endlessly happy.
    III
  　Around the lake, there are several roads, ten thousand trees of weeping willow, ten thousand peach trees. The peach blossoms are as red as the cheeks of youth, the willow leaves flutter like the waist of a young girl. Suddenly a gust of wind and rain, falling red petals become a cloud of green mist. Bai Niangzi has a nylon raincoat and doesn't need to borrow an umbrella, and Yuan Qiao's steamboat ferry doesn't need to pole. Crossing several lake dikes as long as belts, we can't finish admiring the surrounding mountain scenery as green as waves. I still want to brave the rain to visit the Reservoir Bridge. Oh, Reservoir Bridge.
    IV
    When building the reservoir, the weather was cold, the ground was hard and the rocks were like iron. But the heroes' determination was even harder than steel, with courage, what is there to worry about stubborn stones! Baskets were carried to create the twenty-nine meter high dam, picks were used to dig out the half-mile long spillway. Glazed tiles were used to build a lakeside pavilion, granite was piled up to create a small solitary mountain. Rose Valley is fragrant for ten miles in the spring, and the original Three Springs have also been changed. Chairman Mao also wrote an inscription for the bridge, and there are "Dragon-Taming Warriors" standing at the end of the bridge. In those days, tents covered the ground to shield from wind and rain, and cornbread was eaten as a delicious meal. Without their united effort and bloodshed, how could we have today's Jiangshan scenic spot where we can lean on the railing? This is truly understanding the bitterness of planting trees when enjoying the shade, and not forgetting the difficulty of digging a well when drinking water. Oh, digging a well is difficult!
    V
    After the new rain, the evening is cool, the setting sun turns ten thousand mountains orange. The lights are already shimmering on the lake, the sounds of strings and pipes begin along with the returning birds. Our country has been built into socialism, we are ordinary soldiers marching towards communism. Mental labor is combined with physical labor, and we no longer distinguish between countryside and city. Our country fully possesses modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture, catching up with the United States and surpassing England. We have launched passenger rockets to the moon, not just leaning on the white jade railing waiting for the moon to rise. Chang'e does not regret stealing the elixir, she will soon visit Beijing with the Jade Rabbit by her side. Oh, visit Beijing!

    二十年后的水库颂歌
    ——“十三陵水库歌功记”末场插曲
    田汉
     一
  　东方红，太阳升，我们开车来访十三陵。二十年前还是一片村庄地，温榆河荒草乱石外带枯藤。自从毛主席修水库，十万个跃进英雄赛大鹏。白天在太阳底挥汗如雨，黑夜里靠着纵横交错的水银灯。他们跟洪水竞赛不知疲倦，几个月就完成大坝的最高层，尽管积世的蛟龙不听话，挡不住这铜筋铁骨的捆仙绳，才有这风吹湖水皱吴绫，哎呀呀，皱吴绫。
    二
  　日方中，树影浓，来了青年男女与儿童。以前春天寿山头皇帝墓，于今访樱桃沟上少年宫。还有那葡萄园里春醪熟，杏花村畔酒旗红。（白）你听见老爷爷说过吗？（唱）回翁缚刃诛妖蟒，村妇抽刀斩孽龙，怎及得英雄人十万，移山造海夺天工，一百二十瓩电力功劳大，三十万亩良田产量丰。一百二十万斤鱼虾吃不尽，还有那一钱不费的明月清风，俺这儿是家家户户乐无穷。哎呀呀，乐无穷。
    三
  　绕湖边，路几条，万树垂杨万树桃。桃花红似青年颊，柳叶翩如少女腰，忽然一阵风和雨，落红成阵绿烟飘。白娘子有尼龙雨衣无须借伞，那袁樵汽船摆渡也不用撑篙。穿过了几道湖堤长似带，赏不尽四围山色碧如涛。我还要冒雨来游水库桥。哎呀呀，水库桥。
    四
    修库时，天气寒，地硬岩坚像铁一般。可是英雄们决心更比钢铁硬，有勇气何愁石块顽！一筐筐挑成二十九公尺的拦河坝，一镐镐挖出半里长的溢洪湾。琉璃瓦盖出个湖心亭子，花岗岩堆就个小孤山。玫瑰谷春来香十里，当日的三泉也改了观。毛主席还给大桥题过字，还有“降龙勇士”矗立在桥端。当日是帐篷满地遮风雨，啃着窝窝头当美餐。没有他们万众一心流血汗，那有今日这江山胜处倚栏杆？这才是乘凉要知种树苦，饮水休忘凿井难，哎呀呀，凿井难！
    五
    新雨后，晚凉生，夕阳西下万山橙。华灯已颤湖波影，弦管初同归鸟鸣。我国已建成社会主义，我们是向共产主义迈进的普通兵。脑力劳动结合了体力劳动，早已不分什么乡来论什么城。我国完全具有现代工业、农业和科学文化，赶上了美来超过了英。我们向月球射出了旅客火箭，岂止是斜倚着白玉栏杆待月明？嫦娥也不悔偷灵药，她不久就要玉兔随身访北京，哎呀呀，访北京！
