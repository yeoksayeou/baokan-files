    The "Wanbao Mountain" of Mass Wisdom
    ——A Record of the Technical Innovation "Temple Fair" in Shanghai's Industrial Sector
    By our reporter Gao Jie
    Recently, the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, and some district workers' clubs have hosted many technical innovation temple fairs.
    This is an unprecedented mass technical innovation movement grand review and advanced experience exchange.
    Everyone Can Innovate, Everyone Can Create
    More than two thousand factories in the city concentrated and massively displayed their technical innovation achievements since the Great Leap Forward in production this year at the temple fairs. More than 30,000 vivid facts specifically and clearly tell people: technical innovation is not mysterious, everyone can innovate, everyone can create.
    Among the projects exhibited at the temple fairs, there are creations by engineers and senior technicians; however, a larger number are creations by technical workers, general workers, young technicians, and odd-job workers. Many major innovations are the result of these ordinary laborers' bold imagination and painstaking research. In the heavy industry system, the Shanghai Electric Meter Factory is noteworthy. In the past, the manufacturing of various precision instruments was mostly done by hand. This time, during the Great Leap Forward in production, the employees proposed "eleven -izations" such as equipment automation, drill press multi-heading, fitter mechanization, and multi-tool cutting as the direction of their struggle, and the entire factory engaged in technical innovation on a large scale. In the past three months, more than 300 tools and equipment have been improved, most of which were proposed by workers. The temple fair exhibited an adjustable ten-head drill press modified by Zhu Lifeng, an old worker at the factory, which can drill ten holes simultaneously, and the size and position of the holes can be adjusted at will. Such a drill is very suitable for many machine factories and instrument factories; since the exhibition, it has received about a thousand "want to buy orders" requesting the supply of technical data. The most popular innovation experience of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, "casting lathe tools from waste high-speed steel," was successfully researched and developed by Jin Weimin, an ordinary clerk in the factory, Zhang Huanda, a workshop deputy director from a worker background, and Zhu Peiyu, a young technician. It allows the frequently scrapped tools in the machine factory to be re-smelted and made into new lathe tools, which can save the machine tool factory 20,000 yuan a year.
    At the temple fairs of the textile and light industries, the experience of adding a licker-in roller to the carding machine, which is currently being widely promoted by cotton textile factories and increases production capacity by 50%, was successfully modified by Ma Dekang, an engineer from a worker background at the Anda Textile Factory No. 2, after eight years of research. An automatic kiln exhibited at the enamel industry temple fair was jointly manufactured by four old workers with low levels of education - Chen Peiyuan, a kiln worker from the Huafeng Enamel Factory, Xu Jianmin, a fitter, Sun Weicai, and Hong Guowen, a technician from a worker background. In addition, the semiconductor fiber counter exhibited by State-owned Cotton Mill No. 8, the selenium semiconductor controller of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, and the photoelectric tube-controlled lights of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17, etc., are all things that some senior researchers did not do in the past or did not dare to do.
    Eliminate Superstition and Inferiority Complex
    A large number of facts fundamentally eliminated the inferiority complex and the idea of foreign superstition of some people. The most representative are female textile workers. In the past, they always thought that they had low levels of education and were manual operators, so there was nothing to innovate. When Ju Cainv from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 was testing a semi-automatic cleaning device in the factory, many female workers sarcastically said to her: "Want to be a female innovator!" "Engineers and technicians haven't been successful, can you do it?" This time at the temple fair, she exhibited four types of semi-automatic cleaning devices that she improved, and also exhibited an automatic joint cleaner collectively created by eleven roving frame female workers and technicians from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 9. Many female workers were greatly moved after seeing them and immediately promoted these experiences after returning.
    In the printing and dyeing industry, there used to be a superstition: to trial-produce high-end products, it is necessary to import machines and raw materials from foreign countries first. The facts of the temple fair completely destroyed this superstition. In just two or three months, employees of various factories successfully trial-produced many high-end products that have reached the world's advanced level, such as plastic film printing, electrostatic flocking printing, permanent rainproof cloth, and anti-shrink and anti-wrinkle cloth, as well as scented flower cloth, mosquito-repellent cloth, and luminous cloth that are rarely produced abroad. In order to trial-produce and produce these high-end products, various factories have manufactured dozens of modern equipment and instruments such as anti-shrink machines, resin finishing high-temperature baking machines, automatic temperature and humidity controllers, and semiconductor automatic regulators for dye solution temperature, and have innovated hundreds of processes and operating methods.
    One Factory Blossoms Red Flowers, Every Factory Bears Golden Fruit
    The technical innovation temple fair is full of the communist spirit of cooperation among employees, and the spirit of everyone helping each other, which has been greatly improved.
    The factories set up "stalls" at the temple fair, not only introducing technical innovation experiences without reservation, but also helping foreign factories solve difficult problems in production through "cooperation platforms," "talent recruitment lists," "topic platforms," and "small teahouses."
    The technical innovation temple fair has been warmly welcomed by employees for more than twenty days because it adopted the traditional national forms loved by the working people. Workers call the technical innovation temple fair "Wanbao Mountain," visiting the exhibition temple fair is "opening Wanbao Mountain to find the golden key," is "treasure hunting"; praising this temple fair is "one factory blossoms red flowers, every factory bears golden fruit." Many factories have 70%-80% of their workers coming to visit, and some workers come whenever they have time, regardless of whether it is early or late. A worker from Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory visited the meeting seven times in three days.
    The exhibition has adopted the method of being organized, managed, and viewed by the employees themselves from beginning to end. When many temple fair organizers talked about their experience in holding technical innovation temple fairs, they unanimously believed that this is a good method of using the mass line to summarize and promote advanced experiences, which completely changed the conventional practice of industrial departments in the past of summarizing experiences by leading agencies and holding meetings to exchange advanced experiences.
    Currently, industries such as textile and printing and dyeing are further systematically organizing, summarizing, and improving the technical innovation experiences obtained at the temple fair based on mass opinions, and then printing and distributing them to factories. At the same time, preparations are being made to guide the mass technical innovation movement of the previous stage in a new direction in a purposeful manner, so that Shanghai's industry will develop in the direction of large-scale, precision, and high-end.

    群众智慧的“万宝山”
    ——记上海工业部门的技术革新“庙会”
    本报记者　高洁
    最近时期，上海中苏友好大厦、上海工人文化宫、中山公园和一些区的工人俱乐部，举办了好多起技术革新的庙会。
    这是一次史无前例的群众性技术革新运动大检阅和先进经验的大交流。
    人人可以革新，人人可以创造
    全市二千多个工厂在庙会上集中、大量地展出了今年生产大跃进以来的技术革新成就。三万多件活生生的事实，具体、鲜明地告诉人们：革新技术并不神秘，人人都可以革新，人人都可以创造。
    庙会展出的项目中，有工程师、高级技术员的创造；但是，更大量的是技术工人、一般工人、青年技术员和勤杂工等的创造。很多重大的革新都是这些平凡劳动者的大胆想像、刻苦钻研的结果。重工业系统引人注意的是上海电表厂，以往制造各种精密仪表大部分是手工操作。这次在生产大跃进中，职工们提出了设备自动化、钻床多头化、钳工机械化、切削多刀化等“十一化”作为奋斗方向，全厂大闹技术革新。三个月来，改进了三百多项工具和设备，其中绝大部分是工人提出的。庙会上展出了该厂老工人朱立凤改装的一台活络十头钻床，可以同时钻十个眼孔，钻孔的大小、位置还可以随意调节。这样的钻头对很多机器厂和仪表厂都非常适用；展出以来，收到了约一千张“看中单”，要求供给技术资料。上海机床厂一项最受欢迎的革新经验“废高速钢铸造车刀”是厂里一个普通办事员金伟民、工人出身的车间副主任张焕大和青年技术员朱培瑜合作研究成功的，它使机器厂里经常大量报废的刀具可以回炉再制成新的车刀，单是机床厂一年就可以节省二万元。
    在纺织和轻工业的庙会上，目前棉纺织厂正在大量推广的在梳棉机上加装刺辊，使生产能力提高50％的经验，就是安达纺织二厂一个工人出身的工程师马德康经过八年研究，改装成功的。搪瓷工业庙会展出的一台自动窑炉，是由四个文化很低的老工人——华丰搪瓷厂的烧窑工陈佩元、钳工徐建民、孙维才和工人出身的技术员洪国文等合作制造的。此外，还有国棉八厂展出的半导体纤维计数器、国棉四厂的硒半导体控制仪；国棉十七厂的光电管控制电灯，等等，都是某些高级研究人员过去没有做或是不敢做的。
    打掉迷信和自卑心理
    大量的事实，从根本上打掉了某些人的自卑心理和迷信外国的思想。最有代表性的是纺织女工。过去她们总认为自己文化低，又是手工操作，没有什么好革新的。国棉一厂居财女在厂里试验半自动清洁装置的时候，还有不少女工讽刺她：“想当女革新家啦！”“工程师、技术员都没有搞成，你行吗？”这次庙会上，展出了她改进的四种半自动清洁装置，同时还展出了国棉九厂十一个挡车女工和技术人员集体创造的自动联合清洁器。很多女工看了以后，大为感动，回去后立即推广了这些经验。
    印染行业中，过去有一种迷信：要试制高级产品，必须先从外国进口机器和原料。庙会的事实，彻底摧毁了这种迷信。为时仅两三个月，各厂职工就试制成功许多达到世界先进水平的高级产品，如塑料薄膜印花、静电植绒印花、永久性防雨布、防缩防皱布等，还有国外很少生产过的香味花布、防蚊布、夜光布等。为了试制和生产这些高级产品，各厂制成了防缩机、树脂整理高温烘焙机、温湿度自动控制器、染液温度半导体自动调节器等几十种现代化的设备和仪表，革新了上百种的工艺和操作方法。
    一厂开红花，厂厂结金果
    在技术革新庙会上，充满了职工中共产主义的协作精神，一人有事大家帮忙的精神，是大大提高了。
    各厂在庙会上设立“摊头”，不仅毫无保留地介绍技术革新经验，他们还通过“协作台”、“招贤榜”、“课题台”、“小茶馆”等等，帮助外厂解决生产中的困难问题。
    技术革新庙会因为采用了劳动人民喜爱的民族传统形式，二十多天来，受到职工们热烈的欢迎。工人称技术革新庙会是“万宝山”，参观展览庙会是“打开万宝山，找到金钥匙”，是“觅宝”；赞扬这种庙会是“一厂开红花，厂厂结金果”。很多工厂70％—80％的工人都来参观了，有的工人不分早晚，有空就来。同丰印染厂一个工人三天之内到会看了七次。
    展览会自始至终采取了由职工群众自己办、自己管、自己看的方式。很多庙会主持人在谈起举办技术革新庙会的体会时，一致认为：这是运用群众路线总结和推广先进经验的好方法，它完全改变了过去工业部门普遍采取的由领导机关总结经验和召开会议交流先进经验的常规。
    目前，纺织、印染等行业正在进一步将庙会上获得的技术革新经验，根据群众意见加以系统的整理、总结和提高，然后印发到厂。同时，准备有目的地把前一阶段群众性的技术革新运动引向新的方向，使上海工业向大型、精密、高级方向发展。
