　　Trampling Over the Yandang, Kuocang, and Tiantai Mountains:
    Zhejiang Casts a Prospecting Net

    Hangzhou Dispatch from our newspaper reporter Liu Fan: In order to provide a large number of iron, coal, pyrite, alunite, phosphorus, and several non-ferrous metal mineral resources to meet the needs of great industrial development, the Zhejiang Provincial Geological Bureau is vigorously organizing the masses to report mineral discoveries.

    Zhejiang has always been regarded as a province with scarce mineral resources, but now, people have discovered fifty-seven kinds of minerals. Bourgeois scholars once asserted: "Zhejiang has no phosphate mines," but now a phosphate mine with a considerable reserve has been discovered in Pujiang County, Zhejiang.

    The Zhejiang Provincial Geological Bureau has expanded the existing thirteen specialized geological teams into eighteen regional, comprehensive prospecting and exploration teams. Each team is assigned to a fixed area to thoroughly investigate the mineral resources of the region, changing the past practice of geological teams flying all over the place, only looking for large mines, and not paying attention to medium and small mines. At the same time, the province's eighteen prospecting and exploration teams are combined with the newly established three-person geological groups (or geologists) in each county, and the mineral reporting work of the masses in the townships, forming a province-wide mass geological work network. Now, more than 3,000 employees of the province's prospecting and exploration teams are working hard, crossing mountains and ridges with soaring enthusiasm. Their slogans are: "Advance thousands of miles, ride the wind and waves, and trample over the North and South Yandang (Mountains)"; "Ride the East Sea wind, find the treasures of Kuocang (Mountain), ride the waves of the Lingjiang River, and break the minerals of Tiantai (Mountain)."

　　踏破雁荡、括苍、天台三大山
    浙江撒下勘探网
    本报杭州讯记者刘凡报道：为了提供大量的铁、煤、黄铁矿、明矾石、磷及若干有色金属矿产资源，以适应工业大发展的需要，浙江省地质局大力组织群众报矿。
    浙江素来被人认为是矿产贫乏的省份，可是现在，人们已发现了五十七种矿产。资产阶级学者曾断言：“浙江无磷矿”，而现在在浙江浦江县发现了一个储量不小的磷矿。
    浙江省地质局把现有十三个专业性的地质队，扩充为十八个区域性、综合性的普查勘探队，各队固定一个地区，深入查清本地区的矿产资源，改变了过去地质队满天飞，只找大矿，不注意中小型矿的做法。同时使全省十八个普查勘探队与各县新建立的三人地质小组（或地质员）、和乡里的群众报矿工作结合起来，构成了一个全省群众性的地质工作网。现在全省普查勘探队的三千多职工正以冲天的干劲，翻山越岭进行紧张的劳动。他们的口号是：“前进千里，乘风破浪，踏破南北雁荡（山名）”；“乘东海之风，找括苍（山名）之宝，踏灵江之浪，破天台（山名）之矿”。
