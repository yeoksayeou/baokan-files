Two Concepts of Relief and Welfare Work
Song Qingling

The Chinese Welfare Institute is commemorating its twentieth anniversary. These twenty years coincide with two eras in China's long history. We can say that the Chinese Welfare Institute was born in one era and grew up in another. We began our work amidst the dying agony of the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, and used our meager efforts to accelerate its collapse; we witnessed the birth and early growth of the new socialist China, and participated in its construction with all our strength. Therefore, we can easily make comparisons and draw certain conclusions about relief and welfare work in two different types of societies.

I

Relief and welfare work is a necessary adjunct to the political system of every modern country. Nature knows no national boundaries, and it is often fickle and uncontrollable, so relief work is generally needed. Similarly, welfare work is not exclusive to any particular political system. The state itself contains the meaning of serving society as an institution, and it was established in a specific period of history. As society develops from lower to higher forms, welfare facilities also develop, serving a wider range of people and becoming an undeniable responsibility of the state to its members.

However, the political system arises from the economic basis necessary for all of people's lives. Therefore, relief and welfare work cannot but reflect this foundation. In every society, relief and welfare work is governed by general social laws, which in its environment determine the relationship between people.

Therefore: In the process of protecting people from natural disasters, and in providing relief and comfort to people through various welfare measures of modern civilization, the concept of this service differs due to the different nature of society, and the difference is significant. The inherent characteristics of various political systems are directly reflected in their attitude towards relief and welfare work and the way they control relief and welfare work.

II

In the case where the means of production are privately owned, the striking feature of human society is its fragmentation, with each person independently seeking a livelihood. The highest purpose of life is to obtain the means of producing wealth; without the means of producing wealth, the individual is inevitably controlled by the possessor of the means of production. This forms an irreconcilable contradiction between the individual and society: by nature and need, he must exist as a social being, but society forces him to live in isolation. This creates a fatal conflict between man and society. This irreconcilable contradiction leads to hostile relations between people and the brutal struggle for personal possession, which is the "lawlessness" struggle between society and production. Those who possess the instruments of production automatically take the deprivation of others as their goal, in order to obtain the highest profits from people, land, and machines. "Everyone for himself," this is the social law of feudalism and capitalism. It is also the law of the jungle.

Of course, those who advocate this social system always want to make it look better. Especially recently, you can hear many claims about "people's capitalism" or "welfare states." These are attempts to deceive the people, to make them believe that the philosophy and structure of the old society have undergone fundamental changes, that in the economic and political life of the country, the possessors and the deprived of the means of production are actually partners, and that the state has become a kind protector of the people standing above class interests.

Throughout history, reality has shattered this clever propaganda more than once. Human social life shows that under private ownership of the means of production, there will inevitably be an accelerated concentration of capital, land, and machinery; and when this polarization occurs, the government and the owners of large means of production form a strong alliance, which serves the interests of the few and opposes the welfare of the majority. The vast majority of the people suffer severe restrictions; due to the extreme inequality of wealth distribution, they suffer spiritual and physical devastation on a large scale. In fact, even when the chronic economic crisis that destroys this social system is at a low ebb, there is exploitation of the vast majority of the population.

This is the case in all stages of capitalist society, even when production and technology are most advanced, even in places where the working class and the trade union movement are most developed. Because the structure of society makes it impossible for the worker to recover the full value of his labor. He may be able to temporarily share a larger portion of the wealth he produces through the power of organization, through wages and "trimmed" welfare, but the ever-increasing profits of the owners of the means of production show where the bulk of the value created by the worker has gone. This situation is several times more serious in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

The economic status of the people directly affects their access to cultural education. The less a person earns, the lower his level of education, and the less opportunity he has for cultural development. And culture itself suffers, because the means of transportation and learning are controlled by the possessors of the means of production. They are afraid of knowledge and use it as a weapon of class antagonism. The impression is left in the public's mind that a person who thinks well and reads a lot is somewhat "eccentric" and therefore not suitable for contact with "ordinary" people. Intellectuals are openly insulted, discriminated against in life and work, and considered untrustworthy and unable to hold public office. It is not surprising that this situation has caused concern among the leading figures of upright intellectuals in those societies. An eminent American educator recently wrote in the New York Times with obvious trepidation: "Perhaps the most serious failure of the American education system is that it has created a trend of passivity among intellectuals."

But we should see that behind this situation, there is a hand at play. In a welfare program in a modern industrial society, cultural and educational undertakings must be included; but its content is subject to strict restrictions. Political and business leaders believe that workers should concentrate on mastering increasingly complex machines, while being content with "pure entertainment," but should not be encouraged to think. If they want to think, it is best to bind them in the embrace of idealism, so that it is easy to make people content with the status quo, to make them believe that everything is static, and even the clear contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production is unchanging. Wouldn't it be great if they could regard the cruel exploitation between people as a "natural reaction" and accept it as a code of life?

The fact is obvious: in the old society, most of the people did not enjoy the blessings of the "welfare state." Their so-called "freedom" can only be explained as being isolated and dispersed by all means, and therefore only able to depend on land and machines that do not belong to them. They are insecure because the owners of the means of production can drive them away at will. They are subjected to all sorts of exploitation, forced to "speed up" their work, devastated by corruption in social life, lacking education and medical facilities, and in many countries, persecuted by heinous racial discrimination.

In a social environment where some people live off the labor of others and some people's labor is exploited by others, how can one talk about "social sympathy"? In such a society, where all its political, philosophical, religious, legal, artistic, and other ideas and institutions are designed to perpetuate the system of exploitation, can we still talk about concern for the individual?

In that society, relief and welfare work is also part of the great effort to sanctify this system. The purpose of their plans and facilities is nothing more than to use human sympathy and goodwill to divert attention from the enormous damage and devastation to people caused by the old society. Therefore, so-called relief and welfare work is used to do some "make-up" work for societies that have not fulfilled their duties to the people. At its worst, this relief and welfare work taints the name of "charity." At best, they are only some benefits that the people have won through arduous struggle, and the people must continue to struggle to prevent these plans from being written off in the name of "opposing socialist tendencies" or in a frenzy of arms expansion.

In fact, in the old society, most of the relief and welfare work was done as another big business. First, society itself creates problems, expanding and promoting the urgent need for "charity." Second, because that country does not have sufficient conditions to formulate and implement the relief and welfare work needed by the people, a large number of private charities have been cultivated. However, there is a limit to the amount of money squeezed from the people. (According to statistics published in the "Nation Weekly" in the United States on January 18, 1958, in the United States, about 70% of donations to non-governmental relief and welfare undertakings come from private individuals, only 7% come from large enterprises, and the rest come from organized workers and other groups.) In this way, in order to obtain a larger sum of money, a chaotic struggle unfolds between various organizations and management agencies. The article in "Nation Weekly" mentioned this billion-dollar "industry," but it is a "jungle of competition, where the time, money, and energy spent on 'raising' charitable dollars are often as much as when using these charitable dollars." Even in countries where the government bears more of this expense, welfare undertakings are often infamous for their bloated institutions, the prevalence of "bureaucracy," and incompetence. This waste and chaos that often occurs in welfare undertakings provides fertile ground for all kinds of sinecures, self-dealing, and even direct corruption, and the money actually used for relief and welfare undertakings is minimal.

In this case, the needs of society can only be met intermittently and in small amounts, the problem cannot be fundamentally solved, and the end result is that the majority of the people continue to suffer. Due to the very nature of this system, after some effort in "charity," the general attitude simply regards this suffering as an "inevitable" misfortune and treats it as a private matter of the sufferer.

This is relief and welfare work under the capitalist system. In the case of feudal and semi-feudal systems, the responsibilities assumed by the state are even smaller, social sympathy is even worse among those who can donate to "charity," and therefore the people suffer many times more, because that society has reached its final dying stage.

III

Socialism is completely different in essence from all other social systems. The means of production for supplying people's economic and cultural needs are owned by the public or cooperatives. The needs of the entire society determine how these means are used. The purpose of using them is to meet the growing needs of all the people in all aspects through planned and rational use of manpower.

Only forty years of history have proven that this scientific method of managing the country is the most effective, it mobilizes all the country's resources and manpower to complete its goals, and eliminates unnecessary duplication and waste. This not only makes the speed of industrial development far exceed other types of society, but also makes social stability that people have never imagined possible. The cyclical laws of panic encountered by other economic forms no longer apply under the socialist system. The periodic large-scale unemployment and general misery caused by unplanned and unbalanced development no longer occur. Therefore, the large amount of relief work necessary in the old society is no longer necessary.

Of all social forms, socialism is also the most humanitarian in all other respects. Because private ownership of the instruments of production no longer exists, social progress is no longer achieved through the exploitation of working people. The fruits of human labor are reasonably distributed according to each person's contribution to society.

In addition, the socialist system also marks a high degree of social sympathy that is expressed every day. In the history of human development, for the first time there has emerged a society in which there are no vested interests of individuals or groups, and therefore there is no longer a situation of being torn apart by the rampaging desires of people.

Under the socialist system, because the situation of pursuing personal interests as the sole motivation for life has lost its economic and social basis, the antagonistic contradictions between people and between people and society, which characterize feudalism and capitalism, have been resolved and eliminated. Individual interests and public interests have basically merged. The customs of mutual care and cooperation arising from the production process and human nature are expressed in society itself. The individual and his companions reach an agreement, and more and more they fulfill their responsibilities to society from a higher premise, rather than merely from personal desires. He realizes that he must first serve society, which is actually serving himself. Therefore, the happiness of each person becomes equally important to every other person. This is the main law of socialism.

The implementation of this law is not limited to the purpose of striving for survival, as in primitive communes. The socialist system reflects the greatest social development of mankind, and its level is much higher, which is to supply all the people with abundant necessities of life.

At the same time, the purpose of people's lives is by no means merely the "mad pursuit" of commodities, as under capitalism. Similarly, the standards of people's social behavior are also higher. In this society, "the most valuable of all wealth" is people, not profits, so what is important is the development of people.

The organization and production of socialist society require people to be broadly educated, and at the same time they provide opportunities for continuous progress for everyone. On the basis of continuous and rapid growth in production, the state makes the physical and mental well-being of the people a right for all citizens. A variety of welfare undertakings have been expanded, including educational facilities that continuously improve people's intelligence. Only socialism can give people such guarantees, and open up the broadest prospects for developing wisdom to everyone, regardless of their ethnicity or race.

The central idea of Marxism-Leninism guiding socialist construction is to closely combine the ever-increasing knowledge power of the masses of the people with their practical work of collectively improving public welfare, so as to promote the progress of the entire society.

IV

Pre-liberation old China was under the heavy pressure of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial system. The burden on the people's backs was so heavy that they simply could not hold their heads up in poverty. The old system was actually just a huge disaster.

During that period, perhaps no country or people in the world had been the object of international concern as much. Enthusiastic friends from almost every part of the planet participated in this great humanitarian work and helped the Chinese people in their historic struggle against internal and external oppression. This was especially true when we desperately resisted Japanese imperialist aggression. The Chinese people will never forget these friends and their help.

We will also never forget another kind of people and organizations, who also came with "gifts." They pretended to do relief and welfare work. But they turned this work into a worthless "showcase," completely unable to solve the problems at the time. Their intention was to paralyze and deceive our people, and undermine our revolutionary spirit and national will. But these "philanthropists" failed because they, along with their allies – the Chinese reactionaries – represented only what was dying and irreparable. They were "too late" because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, had decided to overthrow the old society and replace it with a new society that could defend and revitalize the Chinese nation.

Since this was the key to our national survival, it inevitably affected every aspect of our lives, including relief and welfare work. From the beginning, this aspect had its representatives participating on the side of the people, jointly carrying out this great struggle. The China Defense League – now known as the Chinese Welfare Institute – is one of them. We are very proud to have this glorious record.

Due to the great victory in the struggle to win the people's power, establish the People's Republic of China, and transform our country into a socialist society, the face of our country has been completely renewed. This has also brought about tremendous changes in our relief and welfare work. Under the socialist system, our work has achieved a recognized status, they are a part of our national functions, they are related to the interests of all the people, and therefore they are closely concerned by all the people.

In today's China, it is impossible for a person or a region to be isolated and helpless in difficulty. The whole society feels responsible and will therefore take action. The whole society has been mobilized to fight against the economic and cultural backwardness we inherited from the past, so as to give all of our people a better and more stable life.

We are also waging a resolute struggle against nature, because it sometimes still causes disasters in some areas of our country. You only need to recall how we fought against the floods of 1950, 1954, and 1957. These serious threats have been resolutely overcome by us, and the effectiveness has been higher than ever seen in our history. Similarly, we have also launched struggles against drought, locusts, and the elimination of plant and animal diseases and pests, etc. Famine can no longer run rampant on our land.

All this has become possible because of the socialist nature of our country, because of the leadership with the Chinese Communist Party at its core, which has insisted on mobilizing the people and relying on their social consciousness to strive for progress and implement the principle of self-reliance. Under the test of several major disasters in our country, we have discovered the concept of socialist relief and welfare work, which gives us a method to overcome all difficulties. Moreover, we have moved forward and started a series of construction plans of various scales to change the face of nature, eliminate disaster areas, and adorn our country with many sluices, power stations, irrigation systems, and huge industrial bases.

All this shows the new strength that socialism has given us. It also shows that China will never be like it used to be, a country where the people are deeply trapped in the clutches of misfortune, helpless and dependent everywhere. A truly new China has stood up in the world.

We have also made the same progress in welfare undertakings. The right to work, the right to education, medical benefits, care for the elderly, rest and recreation, all of this is clearly stipulated in our constitution, giving guarantees to every citizen. This is the truth: Although we have done a lot of work, we have only just begun to realize these guarantees, and we still have a long way to go to be fully satisfied. This is because our long-term backwardness cannot be completely eliminated overnight. First of all, huge amounts of money must be invested in the basic construction projects of the industrial economy. However, this type of investment has already begun to bring benefits to the people, and will bring more benefits. Therefore, when our country is performing this task, although it is only gradual and not perfect for the time being, as our entire national construction moves forward, it will achieve greater achievements and be more satisfied.

We often have the Soviet Union as our example. We see how amazing its achievements have been, despite the fact that the Soviet Union has gone through twenty years of war and post-war recovery. For many years, the education, medical care, and other welfare benefits enjoyed by the Soviet people have not been possible in any capitalist country, even the most advanced capitalist country. Some experts in Western countries now have to admit this fact very frankly. The Soviet Union's industrial base has been established extremely solidly, so it has been able to take some extremely bold measures to catch up with or surpass capitalist countries in all aspects of production and life.

We Chinese people firmly believe that this is also our future. However, we are not waiting, we are working hard and striving for the top, which our people have never experienced in thousands of years of history. As time goes by, our ability to be self-sufficient will grow several times according to the laws of development of socialist society.

In addition, the Chinese people today are not only able to solve our own problems, but we also have the strength to help friends in the world who are in difficulty for various reasons. We have started doing this since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and we will continue to do so in the future. The reason why the Chinese people have adopted such cooperation is not as a "reward" for the help that friends gave us in our "years of suffering," but to extend the humanitarian principles that guide our thinking and actions at home to foreign countries. In fact, it is to share the fruits of our socialism with more people. We help others with sincere friendship and wholeheartedness, without any conditions. A socialist country can only treat other countries in this way.

    救济福利工作的两种概念
    宋庆龄
    中国福利会正在纪念它的二十周年。这二十年恰当中国漫长历史中的两个时代。我们可以说，中国福利会是在一个时代里诞生，而在另一个时代里长成的。我们在半封建半殖民地的旧中国垂死的痛苦中开始了工作，并曾用我们棉薄的微力来加速它的崩溃；我们看见了新的社会主义中国的诞生和它初期的生长，并用我们的全力参加了它的建设。因此，我们便于进行比较，能够就两种不同类型社会的救济福利工作，得出某些结论。
    一
    救济福利工作是每一个现代国家政治制度的必需的附带物。自然界并无国界之分，它常常是变幻多端，无法控制的，因此一般都需要有救济工作。同样，福利工作也并不是任何特殊的政治制度所专有的。国家本身就含有作为一个机构来为社会服务的意义，它是在历史上某一特定的时期中建立起来的。当社会从低级发展到更高级的形式，福利设施也随之而发展，为更广大的人群服务，成为国家对它的成员不可推诿的一种职责。
    然而，政治制度是从人民一切生活的必需的经济基础上产生出来的。因此，救济福利工作也就不能不成为这种基础的反映。在每一个社会里，救济福利工作都受到一般社会法则的支配，这种社会法则在它的环境中也就决定了人与人之间的关系。
    因此：在保护人民免受自然灾害的过程中，在使人民获得现代文明的各项福利措施的救助和慰籍的工作中，由于社会性质的不同，这种服务的概念也有所区别，而且有很大的区别。各种政治制度的内在特征，也就直接反映在它们对待救济福利工作的态度上，和它们掌握救济福利工作的方式上。
    二
    在生产手段属于私人所有的情况下，人类社会显著的特点是它的分散性，每个人都孤立地自谋生活。生活的最高目的是获得生产财富的手段；没有生产财富的手段，个人便必然为生产手段的占有者所左右。这就形成了个人与社会之间的不可解决的矛盾：从人的天性和需要来说，他必需作为一个社会的人而存在，但社会却迫使他孤立地生活。这便造成了人与社会的致命冲突。这种不可解决的矛盾导致了人与人之间的相互敌对关系，与追求个人占有的残酷斗争，也就是社会与生产中间的“无法无天”的斗争。那些占有了生产工具的人，就自动地把剥夺他人作为目标，以便从人、土地和机器取得最高的利润。“人人为己”，这句话乃是封建主义与资本主义的社会法则。它也就是弱肉强食中的法则。
    当然，主张这种社会制度的人们总想装得好看一点。特别在最近，你可以听到许许多多关于“人民资本主义”或“福利国家”的说法。这些都是企图欺骗人民，使他们认为旧社会的哲学和结构已经有了根本的变化，认为在国家的经济生活和政治生活中，生产手段占有者和被剥夺者实际上乃是伙伴的关系，认为国家已成为站在阶级利益之上的人民的慈祥的保护者了。
    在整个历史中，现实已经不止一次地粉碎了这种巧妙的宣传。人类社会生活说明：在生产手段私人所有制的情况下，必然会发生资本、土地、机器的加速集中；而当这种两极化发生的时候，政府和大的生产手段所有者便形成了坚强的同盟，这一同盟为少数人的利益服务，反对大多数群众的福利。绝大多数的人民遭受了严酷的限制；由于财富分配的极度的不平等，他们大批地发生了精神上和肉体上被摧残的现象。事实上，即使当破坏这个社会制度的慢性经济危机处于低潮的时期，也存在着对广大人群的剥夺。
    这种情况，在资本主义社会的各个阶段，即使当生产和技术最为先进的时候，即使在工人阶级和工会运动最发展的地方，都是如此。因为社会的结构使劳动者根本不能收回他的全部劳动价值。他也许可能以组织的力量，通过工资和“镶了边”的福利等，暂时分得他所生产的财富中较大的一分，然而生产手段所有者的利润不断增加，却说明了劳动者所创造价值的大部分，究竟到哪里去了。在殖民地和半殖民地国家里，这种情况更要严重好几倍。
    人民的经济地位直接影响着他们获得文化教育的机会。一个人的收入越少，他受到教育的水平也越低，他获得文化发展的机会也越少。而文化本身也受到了损失，因为交通工具和学习的方便都被控制在生产手段占有者的手中。他们害怕学问，而且把它作为阶级对立的一种武器。在公众头脑里留下了这样的印象，认为一个人善思考，好读书，那末这个人便有些“古怪”，因而也就不适宜和“普通”老百姓接触。知识分子受到公然的侮辱，在生活和工作上被歧视，而且被认为不可信赖，不能担负公职。这种情况，已经在那些社会的正直的知识分子主要人物中间引起忧虑，这是并不奇怪的。美国一位卓越的教育家，最近在纽约时报上用着明显的惊慌的笔调写道：“也许美国教育制度最严重的失败，就是它在知识界中产生了消极性的趋向。”
    不过我们应该看见，在这种情况的后面，却有一只手在摆布着。在一个现代工业社会的福利事业计划中，必须包括文化教育事业；但是它的内容却要遭受严格的限制。政界和大企业的首脑认为，劳动者应集中精力来掌握日益复杂的机器，同时应满足于获得一些“纯粹的消遣”，但是却不能鼓励他们思考。万一他们要思考，那么最好是把他们束缚在唯心主义的包围中，这样就容易使人们安于现状，使他们相信一切都是静止的，连生产的社会性质与生产手段的私人占有制度之间的鲜明矛盾，也是千古不变的。让他们把人与人之间的残酷剥削看作一种“自然的反应”，接受它作为生活的准则，这不是再好也没有的办法了吗？
    事实很明显：在旧社会里，大多数的人民是享受不到“福利国家”的恩赐的。他们所谓“自由”，只能解释为被用一切方法隔离开来，处于分散状态，因而仅能依附于不属于他们自己所有的土地和机器。他们是无保障的，因为生产手段所有者可以随意把他们赶走。他们受到各种各样的剥削，被迫着“加快”赶工，在社会生活中受到贪污腐化的糟蹋，缺乏教育和医疗设施，在许多国家里还受到可恶的种族歧视的迫害。
    在一个有些人依靠他人劳动为生和有些人的劳动却为他人所剥削的社会环境里，怎么还能谈到“社会同情”呢？在这样一个社会里，它所有的政治、哲学、宗教、法律、艺术等观念和制度都是为了用尽办法使剥削制度永存，难道还能谈到对个人的关怀吗？
    在那种社会里，救济福利工作也正是为了使这种制度神圣化的巨大努力中的一部分。他们的计划和设施的目的，不外是利用人类的同情和善意，来转移人们对于旧社会中所造成的对人的巨大损害和糟蹋的注意力。因此，所谓救济福利工作，也就被用来给那些没有对人民尽职的社会，作一些“弥补”的工作。最坏的时候，这种救济福利工作玷污了“慈善”的名义。最好的时候，它们也只不过是人民经过艰苦斗争才能获得的一些利益，而且人民必须继续斗争，以免这些计划被人以“反对社会主义倾向”为名，或者在疯狂的扩张军备中，一笔勾销。
    实际上，在旧社会里，大部分的救济福利事业正是被当作另一种大买卖来做的。首先，社会本身制造了一些问题，扩大和促进了“慈善”的急迫需要。其次，由于那种国家没有足够的条件来制定和实施人民所需要的救济福利工作，于是就培养了大量的私人慈善事业。然而从人民身上榨取的金钱究竟有一个限度。（根据1958年1月18日美国出版的“民族周刊”上所刊载的统计，在美国，对于非官方的救济福利事业的捐款，约有70％来自私人，而仅有7％来自大企业，其余则来自有组织的工人和其他团体。）这样，为了得到较大的一笔钱，在各个不同的组织和经办机构之间，就展开了一场混乱的争夺。“民族周刊”里的文章提到了这一种亿万金元的“工业”，不过是一座
  “角逐的林莽，在这里，为了‘募集’慈善金元所花的时间、金钱与精力，常常和使用这些慈善金元时一样多。”即使在政府承担这笔费用较多的国家里，福利事业也往往因为机构臃肿，“文牍主义”的流行和不能称职而声名狼籍。这种在福利事业中通常出现的浪费与混乱，给各种各样的尸位素餐、营私舞弊以至直接的贪污提供了肥沃的土壤，真正用于救济福利事业的金钱，是微乎其微的。
    在这种情况下，社会的需要只能间歇地和小量地得到满足，问题不能获得根本解决，最后的结果是大部分人民继续遭受苦痛。由于这种制度的本身性质，经过在“慈善”事业上的一番效力之后，一般的态度就干脆把这种苦痛看作“不可避免”的不幸遭遇，而且当作苦难者的私人事情来对待了。
    这就是在资本主义制度下的救济福利工作。在封建和半封建制度的情况下，国家承担的责任就更小了，在那些有能力捐助“慈善”事业的人们中间，社会同情也更差了，因而人民受苦痛也要大上许多倍，因为那种社会已到了最后的垂死阶段。
    三
    社会主义和所有其他社会制度在本质上完全不同。供给人们经济和文化需要的生产手段，是属于公有或合作社所有的。整个社会的需要，决定了如何使用这些手段。使用它们的目的是，通过有计划的和合理的人力使用，来满足全体人民在各方面的不断增长的需要。
    仅仅四十年的历史，已经证明了这种科学的管理国家的方法是最有效能的，它动员了国家的全部资源和人力，来完成它的目标，消除了不必要的重复和浪费现象。这样不仅使工业发展速度远远地超过其他类型的社会，同时也使人们从来没有想像到的社会稳定成为可能。他种经济形式所遭到的周期恐慌的循环法则，在社会主义制度之下，不再发生作用了。由于无计划和不平衡的发展而造成的周期性大规模的失业，和普遍的悲惨生活，不再发生了。因此，在旧社会里所必需的大量救济工作，也就不必要了。
    在所有的社会形态中，社会主义在其他各方面也都是最具有人道主义精神的。因为生产工具私人所有制不复存在了，社会进步的取得，不再有对于劳动人民的剥削了。人类劳动的成果，按照每个人对社会贡献的大小而得到了合理的分配。
    此外，社会主义制度也标志着每天都在表现着的高度的社会同情。在人类发展的历史中，第一次出现了这样一个社会，其中既没有个人既得利益的集团，因而也不再有被人欲横流的相互倾轧搞得支离破碎的情况了。
    在社会主义制度下，由于以追求个人利益为生活唯一动力的情况已经失去了它的经济基础与社会基础，因此标志着封建主义和资本主义的人与人之间、人与社会之间的敌对矛盾，已得到解决，而且消灭了。个人利益和公共利益基本上已经融合在一起了。从生产过程中以及人类天性中所产生的相互关怀和合作的风尚，在社会本身中表现出来了。个人和他的同伴达到了一致，而且越来越多地从一个更崇高的前提，而不是仅仅从个人的欲望来执行他对社会的责任。他觉悟到必须首先为社会服务，而这实际上就是为自己服务。因此，每个人的幸福对其他每一个人，都成为同样重要的事实。这就是社会主义的主要法则。
    这一法则的实施，并不像在原始公社里那样，只限于以争取生存为目的。社会主义制度反映着人类最远大的社会发展，它的水平要高得多，就是供给全体人民以丰富的生活必需品。
    同时，人们生活的目的，也决不是像在资本主义之下，仅只是对于商品的“疯狂追求”。同样地，人们社会行为的标准也更提高了。在这个社会里，“一切财富中最宝贵的”是人，而不是利润，因而重要的是关于人的发展。
    社会主义社会的组织和生产，要求着人们受到广博的教育，同时它们也对每个人提供了不断进步的机会。在生产不断地和迅速地增长的基础上，国家使人民的身心安泰，成为全民的一种权利。扩大了多种的福利事业，其中包括不断提高人们才智的教育设施。只有社会主义能够给予人们这样的保证，并且给每一个人都开辟了发展智慧的最广阔的远景，不管他属于何种民族，何种种族。
    指导社会主义建设的马列主义中心思想，就是使人民群众不断增强的知识力量与他们集体提高公共福利的实际工作密切结合起来，以推动整个社会的前进。
    四
    解放前的旧中国，是处在半封建、半殖民地制度的重压之下的。人民背上的负担是那样沉重，他们在贫困中简直抬不起头来。旧的制度实际上只是一个巨大的灾难。
    在那个时期里，也许世界上没有哪一个国家或人民曾经那样地成为国际关怀的对象。差不多在地球上各个地方的热心朋友们，都参加了这一个伟大的人道主义工作，在中国人民反对内外压迫的历史性斗争中，给与了帮助。当我们不顾一切地抵抗日本帝国主义侵略的时候，情况更是如此。中国人民将永远不会忘记这些朋友和他们的帮助。
    我们也永远不会忘记另外一种人和组织，他们也是带着“赠物”而来的。他们装扮着来做救济和福利工作。但是他们却把这工作变成了毫无价值的一只“展览箱”，完全不能解决当时的问题。他们的意图是麻痹和欺骗我国人民，破坏我们的革命精神和民族意志。可是这些“慈善家们”失败了，因为他们和他们的同盟者——中国的反动派一起，只代表着垂死的和无可挽救的东西。他们已经“太迟了”，因为中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，已经决定了要把旧社会推翻，而把一个能够保卫和复兴中华民族的新社会建立起来代替它。
    由于这是我们民族生存的关键，它必然影响了我们生活的各个方面，包括救济福利工作在内。从开始的阶段，这一方面就有它的代表参加在人民的一边，共同进行了这个巨大的斗争。保卫中国同盟——现名中国福利会——就是其中的一个。我们因为能有这个光荣的纪录而感到十分自豪。
    由于在争取人民的政权、建立中华人民共和国和把我国改造成为社会主义社会的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利，我们国家的面貌已经完全更新了。这也使我们的救济福利工作有了巨大的改变。在社会主义制度下，我们的工作已经取得了一种公认的地位，它们是我们国家职能中的一个部分，它们关系到全体人民的利益，因此也为全体人民所密切关心。
    在今天的中国，一个人或一个地区在困难中孤立无援的情况，已经不可能发生了。整个社会都感到有责任，因而就会采取行动。整个社会都已经动员起来，向我们从过去继承下来的经济和文化的落后状态进行斗争，这样来使我们全体人民得到一种更美好和安定的生活。
    我们同样地在向自然界进行坚决斗争，因为它有时还在我们国家的某些地区造成灾害。你只要回想一下我们怎样和1950年、1954年和1957年的水灾进行斗争就够了。这些严重的威胁，都被我们坚决地克服了，而且其效能之高，又是在我们历史上所从未见过的。同样，我们也展开了抗旱、灭蝗和消灭动植物的病、虫害等等的斗争。灾荒已经不能在我们的国土上横行了。
    这一切所以成为可能，是由于我们国家的社会主义性质，由于以中国共产党为核心的领导，它坚持了动员人民，依靠他们的社会觉悟的力量，来争取进步和贯彻自救的原则。在我们国家遭遇到几次巨大灾难的考验下，我们发现了社会主义的救济福利工作的概念，给予我们以克服一切困难的方法。而且，我们已经迈步前进，开始了一系列的包括各种规模的建设计划，来改变自然面貌，消灭灾害地区，并且把许多水闸、电站、灌溉系统和巨大的工业基地，点缀在我们的国土上面。
    这一切显出了社会主义所给予我们的新力量。这也说明了中国再也不会像过去那样，成为一个人民深陷在不幸的魔掌中绝望无依、因而到处伸手求援的国家了。一个真正的新中国，已经在世界上站起来了。
    我们在福利事业方面，也已有了同样的进展。劳动的权利、受教育的权利、医疗享受、对老年人的关怀、休息和娱乐，这一切在我们的宪法上都已有明文规定，给每个公民以保证。这是实情：虽然我们已经做了许多工作，可是我们还只是刚刚开始来实现这些保证，而且还要走很长的一段路，才能得到完全满足。这是因为我们长期的落后状态，不是一朝一夕就能完全消除的。首先必须把巨额款项投资在工业经济的基本建设项目里。不过，这一类的投资已经开始给人民带来了好处，而且还要带来更多好处。因此，当我们国家在执行这种任务的时候，虽然暂时还只是渐进的，而且不能算完美的，但是随着我们整个国家建设的前进，将会越来越取得更大的成就，得到更大的满足。
    在我们面前经常有苏联作我们的榜样。我们看到，尽管苏联曾经过二十年的战争和战后恢复的时间，它已经有了多么惊人的成就。许多年来，苏联人民所享受到的教育、医疗和其他种种的福利，是任何一个资本主义国家，甚至最先进的资本主义国家，都不能做到的。西方国家的一些专家现在也不得不很坦率地承认这个事实了。苏联的工业基础已经建立得极其巩固，因而它已能采取一些极其大胆的措施，在生产和生活的各个方面，来赶上或者超过资本主义国家。
    我们中国人民深信，这也就是我们的未来。然而我们并不是在等待，我们正鼓足干劲，力争上游，这是我国人民在数千年来历史中从未经历过的事情。随着时间的前进，我们的自给自足的能力，将按照社会主义社会的发展规律而几倍地增长。
    此外，中国人民今天不仅已经能够解决我们自己的问题，同时我们也已有力量来帮助世界上由于各种原因而处于困难中的朋友。自从中华人民共和国建立以来，我们就开始这样做了，今后还将继续这样做。中国人民所以采取这样的合作，并不是作为对于在我们“苦难的年代”中朋友们曾经给予我们帮助的一种“报偿”，而是把在国内指导我们思想和行动的人道主义原则，扩大到国外去。事实上，也就是使更多的人分享到我们社会主义的成果。我们以真诚的友谊，全心地帮助别人，不附带任何条件。一个社会主义国家，只能采取这样的方式来对待别的国家。
