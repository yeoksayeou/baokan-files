Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd. According to TASS, New York, June 1st: The famous American commentator Drew Pearson published an article in the "News Journal" of York, Pennsylvania, describing how the American industrialist Eaton was persecuted for criticizing the aggressive line of American foreign policy and the domestic police surveillance system.

Pearson said that since Eaton talked about the US intelligence agency FBI using Gestapo methods in a television broadcast, Edgar Hoover's close friend, Ohio Republican Congressman Hiller, distributed a letter to all members of the Congressional "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee," requesting that Eaton be summoned. Although Hiller denied that Hoover himself directed him to write this letter, he admitted that the FBI was pleased with his "initiative."

Pearson pointed out that, at the request of Walter, Chairman of the "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee," television broadcasts have now been organized to attack Eaton. In addition, Walter has also assigned people to "excavate" and "supplement facts" in order to persecute Eaton. According to Pearson, Eaton will be accused of the following crimes: he once organized an economic conference to discuss the idea of developing unimpeded trade between East and West. In addition, Eaton's crimes also include: he "organized a scientists' conference in the 'Pugwash' organization, and Dr. Pauling, a scientist who advocated stopping the testing of hydrogen bombs, participated"; Eaton criticized American foreign policy, saying that the Soviet Union does not want war, etc.

    美著名评论员皮尔逊透露
    美国当局在设法陷害伊顿
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社纽约1日讯：美国著名评论员德鲁·皮尔逊在宾夕法尼亚州约克市的“新闻日报”上发表一篇文章，叙述了美国工业家伊顿因抨击美国外交政策的侵略路线和国内的警察监视制度而遭到迫害的情况。
    皮尔逊说，自从伊顿在电视广播演说中谈到美国特务机关联邦调查局正在采用盖世太保的方法以后，联邦调查局局长埃德加·胡佛的密友、俄亥俄州共和党众议员希勒便向国会“非美活动调查委员会”全体委员分发一封信件，要求传讯伊顿。尽管希勒否认他写这封信是由胡佛本人指使的，但是他承认，联邦调查局对他这种“主动精神”感到高兴。
    皮尔逊指出，根据“非美活动调查委员会”主席华尔特的要求，现在已经组织电视广播来抨击伊顿。此外，华尔特还委派人“发掘”“补充事实”，以便对伊顿进行迫害。据皮尔逊说，伊顿将被控告的罪名是：他曾经组织了一次经济会议，讨论关于发展东西方之间通畅无阻的贸易的主张。此外，伊顿的罪名还有：他在“帕格沃希组织了一次科学家会议，并且有拥护停止试验氢弹的科学家保林博士参加”；伊顿抨击美国外交政策，说苏联不要战争等。
