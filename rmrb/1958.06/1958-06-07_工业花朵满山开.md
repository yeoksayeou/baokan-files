　　Industrial Flowers Bloom All Over the Mountains
　　Jin Jin
　　The First Electric Light
　　The first electric light in our village has shone! This is a bud of the entire village's electrification, like the earliest blooming flower in spring. Following this, thousands upon thousands of such flowers will bloom.
　　When this first electric light initially lit up, it was like a cigarette ember, dim, and a reddish-black color that didn’t provide much light. The deputy secretary of the township general branch, who was in charge of industry, personally sought out the cause, and with several carpentry comrades, dismantled the wooden machinery and belts, meticulously studying them. They worked through the night, and after reassembling them the next day, they were able to light up all ten of the 15-watt light bulbs they had purchased until they shone brightly! Just as bright as the electric lights in the city.
　　Every member of the agricultural cooperative wanted to see it. They came to visit in batches. Some old ladies, who had never seen what an electric light looked like, asked their young grandchildren to support them as they came to see. Elementary school students were happy that they no longer had to use oil lamps for homework at night. The cooperative director thought about using hydroelectric power to set up a flour mill, and he even wondered if they could start construction this month.
　　However, the generator that the township had ordered had not yet arrived. The one they were using now was borrowed from the county. Furthermore, they needed to buy a large quantity of electrical wire and light bulbs. If every household in the cooperative were to install electric lights and the flour mill were to officially start operating, it would still take half a month. Waiting half a month wouldn't normally be anything, but now it felt like waiting half a year. The secretary of the township general branch had already called to urge them, and the reply was that many townships had ordered generators, and it was difficult to deliver them all at once, but they would definitely be delivered in due course.
　　The construction of this hydroelectric power station is very simple. A small stream flows into the water turbine, and the cooperative members usually come to this small house by the stream to hull rice. Now, several carpentry comrades have made a set of wooden machinery, with a shaft and blades. The rotation can strengthen the power of the water. They made this set of machinery, but they don't know what to call it yet, because the carpentry comrades designed and created it themselves. Some say they should call it a water turbine. That doesn't matter. The important thing is whether it can generate electricity. Now that they have seen it generate electricity with their own eyes, they are as happy as if they had given birth to their first child. A county committee sent an engineer to take a look, who said that it could power seventy electric lights and also drive machinery to grind flour. In the past, one person would spend a whole day grinding dozens of kilograms of wheat. Once the machine is installed, with the flip of a switch, several hundred kilograms can be ground in less than a day.
　　According to the industrial plan in the township, four more hydroelectric power stations are to be built, one of which is large and can transmit electricity all the way to the county. By then, the thermal power plant in the county can be converted to other factories.
　　The Mess Hall Becomes a Factory
　　In our township, there is a cooperative that originally wanted to set up a mess hall. One day, the deputy secretary of the county committee had just been transferred to this cooperative. After taking a look, he decided not to set up a mess hall but to convert it into a factory.
　　The cooperative director felt a little strange. He asked:
　　"Secretary Huang, the mess hall only has two large iron pots and one stove. There are no machines or workers. Is it really possible to set up a factory? I don't quite believe it."
　　The county committee deputy secretary smiled and said calmly:
　　"We just need two large iron pots and one stove. As for workers, you can be one, and I can be one too."
　　So what kind of factory should they set up? The county committee deputy secretary said they should set up a factory to extract turpentine. He said that turpentine can be used as a medicinal ingredient. In the past, it was imported from foreign countries. Now, we need to make more ourselves. One tael of turpentine costs six jiao. The raw material is pine needles, which are everywhere in our mountainous area. In the past, they were burned as firewood, but now they are becoming treasures. One hundred jin of pine needles can be used to extract six taels of turpentine, and two large iron pots can extract thirty-six taels a day.
　　The county committee deputy secretary and the cooperative director agreed that they would definitely set it up within ten days. The cooperative director also assigned the workers, asking Uncle A-Tu, who was originally going to cook in the mess hall, to manage the boiler and extract the oil. In addition, he found another worker to go up the mountain to pick pine needles. They can learn the technology they don't understand. The county committee deputy secretary wrote a note to the cooperative director. He said:
　　"Ask Uncle A-Tu to go to the township to collect six jin of rice coupons and go to Xindeng to visit. Xindeng set it up the day before yesterday."
　　Uncle A-Tu carried a simple backpack and an umbrella and went off in a hurry.
　　The cooperative director accompanied the county committee deputy secretary to the accounting office. They calculated a detailed account with the accountant and decided to set up a paper mill. The raw materials would be rice straw and dead bamboo from the bamboo mountain. They selected several papermaking workers from among the cooperative members and went to look for a factory building, preparing to start construction next month.
　　Sweet Crisp Candy and Fertilizer Powder
　　Township General Branch Secretary Yu returned from attending the county and township cadre conference in the county and told the directors of the four agricultural cooperatives that a certain township grinds the yellow strips split from mao bamboo into powder and makes pastries that are fragrant and sweet. Our township can also set up a food factory. Other factories can also be set up, but we must make use of waste materials. The cooperative directors all went back to figure out how to do it.
　　On the third morning, Deputy Secretary Yu, who was in charge of industry for the township general branch, brought two packages of samples. He spread out one of the packages. It was a yellow powder. He asked everyone to grab some and taste it. This was made by Yangling Cooperative. Everyone licked their lips and said it was sweet and very delicious. He asked everyone to guess what it was made of. Some said it was made of brown rice, and others said it was made of soybeans. Deputy Secretary Yu shook his head and said it was made of peanut shells ground into powder. With some more improvements, it can be made into crisp candy. How interesting that peanut shells can also be eaten!
　　There was also a package of fertilizer powder made by Jinzhou Cooperative. This chemical fertilizer factory had been set up for less than two days, and the sample had already come out. The raw materials for the fertilizer powder are human manure, salt, alum, saltpeter, gypsum, and bone meal. This small package of fertilizer powder sample is very good. It is a white, fine powder, and there are also small, transparent particles like crystals shining with silver light. There is no difference between this and the fertilizer powder bought from the supply and marketing cooperative. The deputy secretary of the general branch was still a little worried and sent it to the county for testing, but he was very confident that this factory would definitely be successful.

　　工业花朵满山开
　　金近
    第一盏电灯
    我们乡里第一盏电灯发光了！这是全乡电气化的一个花苞，像春天里最早开放的一朵鲜花，接着还要开出千千万万朵这样的鲜花来。
    这第一盏电灯开头发光的时候，像一颗香烟火，暗淡的，红得有点发黑，照不亮。负责管工业的乡总支副书记亲自动手找原因，和几个木工同志把木头机器和皮带重新拆下来，细细的研究，忙了一个夜晚，第二天再装上去，把十只已经买到的十五支光的灯泡，都点得雪亮雪亮了！就像城里的电灯一样明亮。
    农业社里每个社员都想看一看，他们一批一批的来参观，有的老太太从来没有见过电灯是个什么样子的，也叫小孙子扶着她来看。小学生高兴的是晚上做功课不要再点油灯了，社长想到的是利用水力发电，可以办个麦粉加工厂，他还想到这个月能不能开工。
    不过，乡里订的一架发电机还没有到，现在用的一架是从县里借来的，还有电线，电灯泡都要大量的买起来，要是全社家家户户都装上电灯，麦粉加工厂正式开工，还要半个把月日子呢。等半个月日子，平时算不得什么，可是现在等起来比等半年还急。乡总支书记早就打电话去催过了，回答说是有好多乡订了发电机，一下子都送来有困难，反正到时候一定送到。
    这个水力发电站的构造很简单，有一条小溪流冲到水椎里来，社员们平时就到这所通溪流的小屋子里去椎米。现在几个木工同志做了一套木头机器，有轴头，有叶子板，转动起来可以加强水的力量，他们做了这套机器，还不知道该叫它什么名字呢，因为木工同志自己设计创造出来的，有的说，就叫它水轮机吧。这个不去管它，要紧的是能不能发出电来，现在亲眼看到发电了，他们就像生下第一个孩子那样的高兴。县委派一个工程师来看看，说是能装七十盏电灯，还能带动机器磨麦粉。过去一个人磨几十斤麦子，就要一天的时间，等装好机器，机关一扳，磨几百斤也要不了一天的时间了。
    在乡里办工业的计划表上，还要办四个水力发电站，其中有一个是大的，发出来的电一直可以通到县里去，到那时候，县里那个火力发电站就可以改办别的工厂了。
    食堂变了工厂
    我们乡里有一个社，原来想办个食堂，那天县委副书记刚下放到这个社里，他去看了一下，就决定不办食堂，要改办一个工厂啦。
    社长觉得有点奇怪，他问：
    “黄书记啊，食堂里只有两口大铁锅，一座炉灶，没有机器，也没有工人，好办工厂？我倒有点不大相信。”
    县委副书记笑了笑，不慌不忙地说：
    “就是只要两口大铁锅，一座炉灶。工人么，你可以当，我也可以当。”
    那末到底要办一所什么工厂呢？县委副书记说，要办一所提炼松节油的工厂。说是松节油可以做药料，从前是外国来的，现在我们自己要多做。一两松节油要六毛钱，原料就是松针，在我们山区里到处都是，过去是当柴烧的，现在要变成宝贝啦，一百斤松针可以炼六两松节油，两口大铁锅一天能炼三十六两。
    县委副书记和社长说好，十天里面一定办起来，社长把工人也派好了，叫原来要在食堂里烧饭的阿土伯管锅炉、提油，另外再找个工人上山摘松针，技术不懂可以学的。县委副书记写了个字条给社长，他说：
    “你叫阿土伯到乡里去领六斤米票，到新登去参观，新登前天就办起来啦。”
    阿土伯背了个简单的背包，还有一把雨伞，跨着急步去了。
    社长陪着县委副书记到会计室里，他们跟会计算了一笔细账，决定再办一所造纸厂，原料就是稻草和竹山上的枯竹。他们从社员当中挑选了几个造纸工人，就去找厂房，准备下个月开工。
    甜酥糖和肥田粉
    乡总支俞支书从县里参加县乡干部大会回来，跟四个农业社的社长说，有个乡用毛竹里劈下来的黄篾磨成粉，做出糕饼来又香又甜。我们乡里也可办个食品工场，别的工厂也可以办起来，不过一定要利用废物，社长都回去想办法去了。
    第三天早上，乡总支管工业的余副支书带来两包样品来，他把其中一包摊开，是黄色的粉末，叫大家抓一些尝尝味道，这是杨岭社做的。大家的舌头舔着嘴唇，都说甜甜的很好吃。他叫大家猜猜看，是用什么做的，有的说是用糙米做的，有的说是用黄豆做的。余副支书摇摇头，他说，是花生壳磨了粉做的，再改进一些，就可以做酥糖了。这多么有趣，花生壳也能吃啦。
    还有一包，是金宙社做的肥田粉，他们这个化学肥料厂开办起来还不到两天，样品就出来了。肥田粉的原料是人粪、盐、白矾、土硝、石膏和骨粉。这一小包肥田粉的样品很好，白白的细粉末，还有像水晶一样透明的细末子闪着银光，这跟供销社里买来的肥田粉没有什么两样。总支副书记还有点不放心，自己送到县里去化验了，不过他很有信心，这个厂是一定办得成的。
