Yixing Dingshu Town Workers Boldly Innovate Technology
    Changing the Backward Production Methods of Pottery

    (Our report) In April this year, over ten thousand pottery workers in Dingshu Town, Yixing, Jiangsu, launched an unprecedented mass technical innovation movement. A technological revolution is being carried out in key operations such as clay refining, shaping, and firing, replacing the backward production methods of hand-patting and kneading, and shoulder-carrying with slip casting, molds, potter's wheels, and machines.

    During the technical innovation movement, veteran workers Yang Yaosheng and Qin Lin Da devoted themselves to research and reduced the original four-step process for making large vats to a one-time process, increasing efficiency fivefold. Young workers at the Zisha Craft Workshop formed technical innovation shock teams, switching entirely to slip casting production in one day, greatly increasing output. Wu Fengbao's team at Pottery Cooperative No. 2 used potter's wheels for production, increasing output from 70 pieces per person per day to 800 pieces. Before June, more than one hundred potter's wheel lathes will be in production throughout the town, with all production using molds and slip casting. In the second half of the year, production will be further transformed into mechanized and electrified production.

    "Half gone with the wind, all gone with the rain." This reflects the backward state of pottery production in Yixing in the past, which "relied on the weather." This situation will be fundamentally changed this year. In May, all fifteen pottery factories and cooperatives in the town will have drying rooms to solve the problem of drying damp blanks. From now on, kiln loading and production can continue as usual even on rainy days. At the same time, eight factories will have eight modern electric clay refining workshops put into production. The remaining factories and cooperatives will also use stone rollers for crushing, completely replacing the method of manual clay pounding and sieving.

    宜兴鼎蜀镇工人大胆革新技术
    改变陶器的落后生产方法
    本报讯　江苏宜兴鼎蜀镇，今年4月间，万余陶器工人群众开展了规模空前的群众性的技术革新运动。在炼泥、成形、煅烧等主要操作上进行技术大革命，将以注浆、模型、辘轳车和机器代替用手拍拍捏捏、脚踏肩挑的落后的生产方法。
    在技术革新运动中，老工人杨耀生、钦林大同志刻苦钻研，把原来制造龙缸需要四道工序改为一次做成，提高工效五倍。紫砂工艺工场青年工人们，组成了技术革新的突击手，一天就全体使用注浆模型生产，产量大大提高。陶业二社吴风保小组使用辘轳车生产，每人由日产七十件，提高到八百件。在6月份以前，全镇将有一百多台辘轳车床生产，全部使用模型和注浆生产，下半年将进一步改变成为机械化电动化生产。
    “风吹一半，雨落全无”。这是反映过去宜兴陶业生产“靠天吃饭”的落后面貌，今年将从根本上改变这一状况，全镇十五个陶器厂、社，在5月份将做到厂厂有烘房，解决潮坯的干燥问题，今后雨天可以照常装窑生产。同时，八个厂将有八个现代化的电动炼泥车间投入生产。其余各厂、社也用石碾粉碎，完全代替用人力捶泥筛的方法。
