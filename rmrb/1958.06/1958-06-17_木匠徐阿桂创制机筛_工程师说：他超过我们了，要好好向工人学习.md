    Carpenter Xu Agui Creates a Mechanical Sieve
    Engineer Says: He Has Surpassed Us, We Must Learn Diligently from the Workers

    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai Huaheng Dye Factory carpenter Xu Agui recently created the "Great Leap Forward Rotary Sieve," fundamentally solving the problem of flying dust, improving workers' labor conditions, and increasing production by more than six times. The quality has also improved, and electricity consumption has been reduced by four-fifths. The material cost of this rotary sieve is only one-tenth of that of the engineer's design, truly meeting the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    Xu Agui is illiterate, 37 years old this year. He has been a carpenter since he was 14. Two years ago, the Huaheng Factory hired him as a permanent worker to do carpentry work in the factory.

    When he went to the "Oil Black" workshop to repair machines, he saw black powder filling the workshop, and every operator looked like a black Zhang Fei, covered in black on their body and face. Even wearing two layers of masks, the spit they coughed up still looked like ink. The operators also told him that becoming a black Zhang Fei was a small matter; the important thing was that the sieve's production efficiency was low and could not "swallow" the semi-finished products from the previous stage. In addition, "Oil Black" is a relatively high-grade dye, and the flying dust could not be used, resulting in significant waste. After listening, Xu Agui thought about how to change this situation. He carefully looked for the cause and found that the "reciprocating sieve" being used reciprocated very slowly and vibrated too much, causing the Oil Black to fly out. Moreover, it required manual feeding, which was very laborious. After finding the root cause, he remembered seeing rotating sieves in a flour mill when he repaired machines there before, and the outside was sealed. He wanted to improve the sieve based on this principle, first solving the problem of flying dust. He boldly told an engineer his idea. This engineer was an American returnee who obtained a master's degree from the University of Illinois in the United States in 1927. After hearing the suggestion from this illiterate A Xu Gui, he said dismissively: "How to change it? If it were easy to change, we would have changed it long ago." At that time, Xu Agui still had faith in those who had "eaten foreign food," and he dared not mention it again after being told that.

    During last year's rectification movement, workers in the Oil Black workshop posted big-character posters criticizing the leadership for not caring about improving the sieves in the Oil Black workshop. Only then did the factory leaders and engineering technicians pay attention to this issue. The engineers believed that the only solution was to use a vacuum cleaner to suck up the flying dust. However, a set of dust removal equipment would cost more than 3,500 yuan, and its only function was to suck up the dust.

    The Two-Anti movement educated Xu Agui. He quickly posted big-character posters and made a model of the "rotary sieve" he had been considering for a long time in his spare time. This sieve uses centrifugal force to hit the powder blocks onto a copper mesh with 120 eyes per inch. The powder passing through the copper mesh is the finished product, and the quality is good. The outside of the copper mesh is sealed with wooden boards, so the dust will not fly out, which can improve the workers' labor conditions. The original sieve required manual feeding, but this sieve is automatically fed, reducing labor intensity. Because this sieve rotates faster than the reciprocating sieve, production can be greatly increased. The factory leaders supported Xu Agui's initiative and told him to quickly make the "rotary sieve."

    Xu Agui was very happy to receive support. He immediately drew a diagram on plywood; he also studied the technical problems in the structure for two consecutive nights; he found some waste materials and, with the cooperation of relevant personnel, quickly assembled the "rotary sieve," spending only more than 300 yuan. When it was officially put into production, its various advantages were immediately displayed! The operators were all very happy. Old worker Song Yuanshun said: "Since I entered the factory, I have been looking forward to this day, and it has finally been realized in the Two-Anti movement." The engineers said: "We admit that Master A Gui has surpassed us. I originally thought that an engineer like me had been studying for several years without success. How could a worker who had not yet removed the label of being illiterate succeed? Now, the facts have taught me that I must learn diligently from the workers in the future."

    The factory's employees excitedly named the sieve the "Great Leap Forward Rotary Sieve."

### 木匠徐阿桂创制机筛  工程师说：他超过我们了，要好好向工人学习

    木匠徐阿桂创制机筛
    工程师说：他超过我们了，要好好向工人学习
    本报讯　上海华亨染料厂木工徐阿桂，最近创造了“跃进式转动机筛”，从根本上解决了粉尘飞扬问题，改善了工人劳动条件，并且使产量提高六倍以上，质量也有提高，节约用电五分之四。这个转动机筛的材料费用只有工程师设计的十分之一，真正符合多快好省的要求。
    徐阿桂是个文盲，今年三十七岁，从十四岁起做木匠，前年，华亨厂吸收他为固定工人，在厂里做木工。
    他到“油黑”车间修理机器时，看到车间里黑粉弥漫，操作工人个个像黑张飞，身上、脸上都沾上黑色，带上两层口罩，吐出来的唾沫还是像墨汁似的。操作工人还告诉他：工人弄成个黑张飞还是小事，重要的是机筛生产效率低，“吃不下”前部分的半制品；另外，“油黑”是一种比较高级的染料，粉尘飞出来，就不能用，浪费很大。徐阿桂听了，他就想，怎样来改变这个状况呢？他仔细地找了找原因，发现是使用的“颠复式机筛”颠复很慢，震动太大，使油黑向外飞，而且需要人工加料，很吃力。他找到根源后，想起了以前给一个面粉厂修机器时，曾看到面粉厂机筛是转动式的，外面是密封的。他想根据这个原理来改进机筛，先解决粉尘飞扬问题。他把自己的想法，大胆告诉一位工程师。这位工程师是美国留学生，1927年在美国依利诺大学获硕士学位。他听了阿徐桂这个文盲的建议满不在乎地说：“怎么改？好改我们老早改了。”徐阿桂当时对“吃过洋饭”的人还有迷信，被他一说，就不敢再提了。
    去年整风运动中，油黑车间工人贴大字报，批评领导对油黑车间机筛的改进不关心。这时，厂的领导人员和工程技术人员才对这个问题重视起来。工程师们认为唯一的办法是用吸尘器把飞出来的粉尘吸掉。可是一套吸尘设备，要花三千五百多元，而且它的作用仅仅是吸粉尘。
    双反运动教育了徐阿桂。他连忙也贴了大字报，同时在业余时间把他经过很长时间考虑好的“转动式机筛”做了一只模型。这种机筛是运用离心作用，把粉块打到每寸一百二十眼的铜网上，通过铜网的粉尘就是成品，质量好；在铜网的外面，用木板密封着，粉尘就飞不出来，可以改善工人的劳动条件。原来的机筛是人工加料，这种机筛是自动加料，减轻劳动强度。由于这种机筛旋转速度比颠复式机筛快，产量可以大大提高。厂的领导人员支持徐阿桂的创举，叫他快一点把“转动式机筛”做出来。
    徐阿桂得到支持，心里很高兴。他立即在三夹板上画了图样；又用两个通宵研究了构造中的技术问题；找了些废料，在有关人员配合下，很快的就把“转动式机筛”装配起来，只花了三百多元。当它正式投入生产时，它的各种优越性立即显示出来了！操作工人们都非常高兴，老工人宋元顺说：“我从进厂就盼望有今朝一日，终于在双反中实现了”。工程师们说：“我们承认，阿桂师傅压倒我们了。我原来以为，像我这样一个工程师，研究了好几年都没有成功，难道一个文盲帽子还未摘掉的工人能成功吗？现在，事实教育了我，今后要好好向工人学习。”
    全厂职工兴奋地把这部机筛命名为“跃进式转动机筛”。
