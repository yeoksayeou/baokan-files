　　Transforming a Repair Workshop into a Medium-Sized Machine Manufacturing Plant Without Spending a Penny or Adding a Single Person
    We are workers from the repair workshop of a textile factory. This year, however, we have undertaken a significant manufacturing task: to produce four thousand boiler-tractor units and twenty-five rubber presses by the end of June. After hearing the communication of the General Line, on May 28th, all comrades in our workshop immediately began to march towards technical revolution, deciding to complete the assembly of this batch of tasks, due by the end of June, twenty days ahead of schedule.
    In the struggle to complete the task ahead of schedule, we boldly reformed technology, setting new records one after another. Drilling workers originally took more than two minutes to drill a hole, but now it only takes a few seconds. Originally, parts were forged manually, producing three or four per furnace per day. Now, using machine forging, we can produce more than seven hundred per furnace per day. Originally, small shafts were made by hand, with a lathe operator making only seventy or eighty per day. Now, using a milling machine, we have increased production to more than eight hundred. Sand molders originally used sand molds, with four or five people turning out one piece a day. Now, using hardwood glue molds, one person can turn out one piece a day. Because everyone's enthusiasm is particularly high, by June 5th, the twenty-five rubber presses were assembled twenty-five days ahead of schedule, and we are certain that the four thousand boiler-tractor units will also be completed by June 10th.
    Moreover, all employees of our General Machinery Department have put forward an even bolder ideal—to establish a medium-sized machine manufacturing plant in a year or a little more, without spending a penny or adding a single person, to manufacture combers, cloth inspection machines, dust collectors, and waste cotton textile machines needed by cotton spinning factories.

　　不花一文钱　不添一个人
    要使一个修理车间变成中型机器制造厂
    我们是纺织厂修机车间的工人，但是今年我们承担了很大的制造任务，6月底就要做好四千台锅驼机和二十五台橡胶压力机。在听了总路线的传达之后，5月28日，我们车间的全体同志立即开始向技术革命进军，决定把6月底要交货的这批任务，提前二十天全部装配完成。
    在争取提前完成任务的斗争中，我们大胆改革技术，新纪录一个接着一个。钻孔工人原来钻一个孔，要用二分多钟，现在只用几秒钟。原来用手工锻造零件，一炉一天制造三、四个，现在改用机器锻造，一炉每天可以制造七百多个。原来用手工造小轴，一个车工一天只能做七、八十个，现在改用铣床做，增加到了八百个以上。翻砂工人原来用砂模翻砂，四、五个人一天翻一块，现在改用硬木胶模，一个人一天就可以翻一块。因为大家的干劲特别大，到6月5日，二十五台橡胶压力机已提前二十五天装配完，四千台锅驼机到6月10日也一定能保证完成。
    不仅如此，我们总机械部全体职工还提出了一个更大胆的理想——决心在一年或者多一点的时间内，不花一文钱，不增加一个人，建立一个中型机器制造厂，制造棉纺厂所需要的精梳机、验布机、吸尘器和废棉纺织机器。　　北京棉纺织联合厂修机车间车工  斯章明
