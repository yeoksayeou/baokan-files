Women's Work in Hejian County Leaps Forward
Tian Xiujuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation

Hejian County is located in the central part of the Hebei Plain. In the nine years since the founding of the country, it has suffered from floods and droughts many times, which seriously threatened the improvement of the people's production and living standards. In order to eradicate natural disasters, the Hejian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its plan for a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, put forward the resounding slogan of "water conservancy throughout the county, only half a pig per person, 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, output crossing the Yellow River, and 1,000 jin of grain per person." This slogan inspired the mobilization of all men and women in the county, creating miracles for history wave after wave. After a winter and spring of fierce fighting, the county basically achieved water conservancy, greening, and a "four-free and three-clean" county by the beginning of April. Hejian has become one of the advanced counties in the province. In these glorious years, the women's work in Hejian County has also created unprecedented achievements with full heroic spirit.

Carry Out the Movement of Diligence and Frugality in Managing Households to Support the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production

In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, the county women's federation first launched a large-scale publicity and education campaign on diligence and frugality in building the country and managing households among the masses, publicizing three mores and three lesses: more going to the fields and less going to the market; more active people and fewer lazy people; more buying of production tools and less selling of consumer goods. Three increases and three decreases: the new atmosphere of increased attendance, increased income, increased investment, less grain consumption, less money consumption, and less food consumption.

This movement was launched under the direct leadership of the county party committee. The county party committee first criticized the erroneous views of some cadres who believed that diligence and frugality in managing households contradicted the central work and should be done by women, promoted the involvement of the whole party, and established a county steering committee. Townships and communes also established corresponding organizations, with the party committee appointing a secretary or standing committee member to take specific leadership. According to the development of the movement, the county party committee conducted four inspections and discussions. At the same time, it organized a publicity force of more than 30,000 people, including county-level reporters, party and Youth League propagandists, women cadres above the team and group leader level, and experts in diligence and frugality in managing households, to contract at each level and launch a vigorous publicity offensive. The general public received an average of five to ten education sessions during the movement.

The county women's federation systematically grasped the development of this movement. In particular, in summarizing the advanced, making breakthroughs in the backward, and changing old customs, it explored and used the following methods, which achieved certain results: (1) Going deep into Huanliu Village and Longwang Village to find out the potential for diligence and frugality, summarize the masses' experience in diligence and frugality in managing households, and hold on-site meetings, where advanced figures shared their experiences to educate the masses. At the meeting, women's work logbooks were also displayed to compare who had more attendance and earned more work points, who raised bigger chickens and laid bigger eggs, who braided more and better straw hats, and whose mixed noodles were both grain-saving and delicious. The masses were very interested in this vivid and flexible publicity and were deeply impressed. (2) Combining socialist education and using debate methods improved the masses' awareness and changed the face of backward people and backward villages. For example, in Xiliuzhuang Village, Shijingcun Township, the attendance rate of women was very low, extravagant waste was practiced for weddings and funerals, and some women had the bad habit of gambling. During the movement, combined with socialist education, the village selected two families, Ding Guizhi and Liu Zhaoyou, with similar populations, labor forces, and incomes, for comparison. The Ding Guizhi family had enough to eat and wear every year, and their life was comfortable, while the Liu Zhaoyou family lacked food and clothing every year and was worried. At the meeting, a debate was launched on why the Liu Zhaoyou family did not have enough grain, and the women looked for loopholes and exchanged experiences in saving grain. After 35 large and small debates, the women's awareness was greatly improved, and the women's attendance rate increased from 20% to 80%. (3) Before the Spring Festival, publicity was carried out among young women to save money during the Spring Festival in response to the old customs of extravagance and waste among the masses. After publicity and education, Shijia Village, Lizikou Township, saved about 1,000 yuan on New Year's Eve. After these methods were tested and experienced, they were promoted throughout the county by using various publicity methods such as county radio stations, Hejian Farmer's Daily, village broadcasting stations, blackboards, and street poetry. In addition to using various publicity tools to spread experience, visits and evaluations were also organized, and two county-wide evaluations were conducted. After the movement turned deeper, a competition boom was formed throughout the county between people and people, teams and teams, and communes and communes, making every township advanced, every commune a model, and every team a typical example. More than 12,000 activists from villages, 1,239 activists from townships, and 114 activists from the county emerged. Zhou Yuxiang, Ma Xiunu, and Li Yuqin, three model cadres who led diligence and frugality in managing households, were selected as banners for the whole county.

Through the efforts of the whole party and the active implementation of women's federations at all levels, the idea that diligence and frugality are glorious and waste is shameful has been widely established among the masses. They call "diligence is a money tree, and frugality is a cornucopia." 89,861 households in the county have formulated plans for diligence and frugality in managing households, accounting for 97% of the total number of households in the county. During the winter water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaign, 88,339 women participated in labor, accounting for 108% of the original 81,722 semi-able-bodied women.

Dare to Think and Dare to Act, Give Play to the Role of Women in the Production Leap Forward

In the great leap forward in agricultural production, how to give full play to the labor efficiency and expertise of women, and at the same time pay attention to solving the special problems of women, is a problem that needs to be further studied in the great leap forward. The county women's federation paid attention to exploring this aspect of experience in mobilizing women to participate in construction, raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and learning farming techniques.

During the winter water conservancy construction, the county women's federation analyzed the potential of women, combined with the publicity of diligence and frugality in managing households, and proposed to women to invest, invest materials, and invest labor, and actively mobilized women to respond to the "three investments." Among the "three investments," investing labor is a central issue. According to the fact that most women had not participated in this kind of heavy labor, the county women's federation proposed that attention should be paid to women's labor protection and safe production in completing the task of water conservancy construction. At the same time, the county women's federation office went deep into the site and summarized the experience of division of labor between men and women on the canal digging site. The specific division of labor was that men beat the frozen soil on the ground. After the frozen soil was dug up, the women dug the loose soil under the frozen soil, dug to a depth of two meters, and then the men continued to dig deeper. Women were responsible for transporting soil on the ground, and some women participated in logistical work such as boiling water and cooking on the construction site. Through the rational division of labor between men and women, women were responsible for the work they could do, and they produced more work and could protect women's safe labor. After this experience was summarized, it was promoted throughout the county. As a result, women actively participated in water conservancy construction and completed the task of completing three main canals, 291 branch canals, 39,678 ditch channels, and digging and repairing 11,100 water wells with men, which could irrigate 1.45 million mu of land, basically achieving water conservancy.

"A flower in the crops depends entirely on manure." Raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer is one of the main measures to increase production and leap forward. In 1957, Hejian County was a leaping county with nine times the number of pigs, from more than 20,000 pigs in the spring to 180,000 pigs by the end of the year. In the leap from 20,000 to 180,000, women gave full play to their expertise and played the glorious role of the main force in raising pigs. At that time, the county party committee proposed a plan to expand the number of pigs to 180,000 and produce 18 carts of fertilizer per pig. The masses had concerns in their minds, believing that there was a lack of feed for raising pigs, the source of piglets was lacking, and swine fever could not be cured. In order to realize the target of raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer proposed by the county party committee, the county women's federation actively went deep into the masses to summarize women's pig-raising experience, and took Beizhongyuan Village, Yaotiangong Township as a pilot to summarize the experience of feeding pigs with substitutes, preventing and controlling swine fever, mating and protecting fetuses, and dividing labor between men and women in collective pig farms, and promoted it to the whole county in a timely manner. In May, it cooperated with relevant departments to convene a county-wide meeting of pig-raising activists. At the meeting, the representatives fully exchanged and reported their years of accumulated pig-raising experience, and proposed more than 150 kinds of coarse feed substitutes. In order to solve the problem of pig breeding, Jin Baoguo and Geng Sannv, pig-raising experts, specially introduced their created double-pig mating method, which can produce about 20 piglets per litter. This experience was welcomed by the masses. On strengthening feeding management to prevent swine fever, Ma Xiunu and Yang Xiuzhi made special introductions. In terms of feeding methods, they can mainly achieve feeding on time and in quantity, eating cold food in hot weather, and eating warm food in winter. In terms of management methods, attention should be paid to the cleanliness and hygiene of the pigsty. Facts are the most persuasive. Through these experience introductions and promotions, the masses' concerns were gradually dispelled. Because the county women's federation was able to collect and summarize the years of creation among the masses in a timely manner and promote it to the masses, it guaranteed the realization of the pig-raising plan proposed by the county party committee, which also showed the talents of women in pig-raising. In 1958, in order to reach the target of raising more than 600,000 pigs, according to the principle of collective breeding as the main and family breeding as the auxiliary, on the basis of the original 701 pig farms (including 196 women's pig farms) and 508 women pig breeders, communes and teams were required to establish pig farms, and women pig breeders reached more than 60%. While developing pig raising, women actively participated in the fertilizer accumulation movement through "three grabs." The three grabs are: (1) Raising more pigs and diligently matting the pens; (2) Pressing green manure in summer and autumn, and proposing the slogan "Labor goes to the depression (field), carrying manure baskets, and coming back with green grass full"; (3) Combining with the health campaign, moving toilets and furniture, accumulating urine separately, storing small ashes separately, and doing a good job of family hygiene. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, women became the main force in accumulating fertilizer. This year, in order to ensure 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, women, in addition to actively participating in collective fertilizer accumulation, also explored fertilizer sources from various aspects to ensure that women's fertilizer accumulation accounted for 60% of the total fertilizer accumulation.

In order to solve the contradiction between women's participation in production and taking care of children, the county women's federation mobilized the masses to generally establish childcare organizations. As of mid-April, the county had taken in more than 47,000 children, accounting for 97.6% of the children who should be taken care of, ensuring the attendance of more than 38,000 mothers, making the attendance rate of women's labor in the county reach 98%.

In order to improve women's labor efficiency, the county party committee has put forward the issue of women marching towards technology. This will make women in the great leap forward in production make a leap from quantity to quality. Women said heroically: "Daizi Mountain, drill it, even if it is a stone, we will hit it half a side." In the spring ploughing and sowing of crops such as sweet potatoes, cotton, and corn, they have begun to learn to sow according to the new operating procedures. With the development of the season, they will learn more new technologies and achieve results and gain experience in actual production.

Promoting Birth Control and Late Marriage Improves the Enthusiasm for Production

In promoting family planning, the county women's federation learned that 18,208 women in the county (accounting for 29% of the total number of women of childbearing age) could not participate in production due to excessive childbearing. This fully shows that without vigorously promoting birth control and late marriage among the masses, it will directly affect the improvement of the people's production and life.

The county party committee leadership discussed this work many times, with the secretary taking the lead, the whole party mobilized with the spirit, and with the energy of implementing the Marriage Law publicity campaign, launched a vigorous publicity. A resolution was made at the county people's congress, and the county established a birth control committee, with the county magistrate as the director, and townships and communes also established birth control organizations. At the same time, a publicity force of more than 60,000 people was organized to conduct large-scale publicity on the benefits of birth control through various types of meetings, which went deep into the hearts of the people. At the complaint meeting of 65 elderly women in Jinghe Township, Wang Renshan's mother tearfully told about her pain of having too many children. After they heard the director of the health center explain the benefits of birth control, 12 old women bought condoms for their daughters-in-law to use on the spot. At the symposium of multi-child couples held in Wang Yayi Village, the method of comparison and accounting was adopted to educate the masses. The Li Shuxiu family of three has only one child. Both husband and wife participate in labor and receive a dividend of 300 yuan throughout the year, and their lives are rich. The Liu Xingen family of six has four children. Only Xingen participates in labor and receives a dividend of 156 yuan throughout the year. Their lives are difficult and they have to rely on national relief.

At the symposium of unmarried young men and women, the disadvantages of early marriage and the advantages of late marriage were debated. After publicity and education at various types of meetings, the masses not only eliminated their concerns and reversed the sayings "People will have wealth, and a large population will make life prosperous" and "Having children early will get help early," but also welcomed the birth control and late marriage policy from the bottom of their hearts.

Following the widespread and in-depth development of publicity work, technical guidance and tool supply must also keep up. After training teachers level by level from the county to the township, more than 8,100 married men and women who were supported by the masses were selected from each production team. The county divided them into 174 areas to train them to serve as three staff members (publicity, technical guidance, and tool sales). Men teach men, and women teach women, which has a very good effect. On this basis, 166 technical guidance groups were established, and 61 technical guidance clinics were added to form a county-wide birth control guidance network.

The Key Lies in Leadership

The Hejian County Committee of the Communist Party of China has always attached importance to women's work. They regard mobilizing women as part of the party's cause, while also taking into account the characteristics of women and the special role of the women's federation. Therefore, in terms of practice, on the one hand, they implement the simultaneous mobilization of men and women, the whole party does women's work, and incorporates the important work related to women proposed by the women's federation and higher levels into the party's work, unified deployment, unified inspection, and teaches women's federation cadres to carry out women's work in conjunction with the central work. For example, the above-mentioned diligence and frugality in managing households, birth control, and the development of childcare organizations to ensure women's attendance are all incorporated into the party's work and promoted by the whole party. On the other hand, in view of the special role of the women's federation and the characteristics of the women, in the central movement, the women's federation is given key points, and the women's federation is allowed to create experience in mobilizing women to complete the central task in combination with solving women's special problems, so that the women's federation becomes the core force for the whole party to do women's work, and also enriches the experience of the central work and promotes the development of the central work. The county party committee also stipulates a system of regular inspection and discussion of women's work every month. For example, the county party committee has conducted four discussions in the movement of diligence and frugality in managing households. Party committees at all levels have given great support and encouragement to women's work in terms of political leadership, organizational promotion, and human and material resources.

    跃进中的河间县妇女工作
    中华全国妇女联合会书记处书记　田秀涓
    河间县位于河北省平原的中部，建国九年来曾多次经受水旱灾害的袭击，严重地威胁着群众生产和生活水平的提高。为了根治自然灾害，中共河间县委在1958年全县农业生产大跃进的规划中，提出了
  “全县水利化，每人只半猪，亩施万斤肥，产量跨黄河，每人千斤粮”的响亮的号召，这个号召鼓舞了全县男女总动员，一浪推一浪地为历史创造了奇迹。经过鏖战一冬一春，4月初全县已基本实现水利化、绿化和四无三洁县。河间成为全省先进县之一。在这光辉岁月里，河间县的妇女工作，同样以十足的英雄气概，创造了空前的战果。
    开展勤俭持家运动  支持农业生产大跃进
    为支援农业生产大跃进，县妇联首先在群众中展开了规模壮阔的勤俭建国、勤俭持家的宣传教育运动，宣传了三多三少：即下地多，赶集少；积极人多，懒人少；买生产工具多，消费品销售少。三增三减：即出勤增，收入增，投资增，用粮少，用钱少，吃粮少的新风气。
    这一运动是在县委直接领导下展开的。县委首先批判了某些干部认为勤俭持家与中心工作矛盾，应该由妇女来作等错误观点，推动全党动手，同时，建立了县指导委员会，乡、社也建立了相应的组织，由党委确定书记或常委一人具体领导。县委根据运动的发展，曾进行了四次检查和讨论，同时还组织了一支包括县级报告员、党团宣传员、队、组长以上妇女骨干和勤俭持家能手，共三万多人的宣传大军，逐级层层包干，展开了声势浩大的宣传攻势。一般群众在运动中平均受到了五至十次的教育。
    县妇联有步骤地掌握了这一运动的发展，特别在总结先进，突击落后，改变旧习俗方面，摸索和运用了以下几种方法，收到了一定的效果：（一）深入到欢留村和龙王村，摸清勤俭潜力，总结群众勤俭持家的经验，并召开现场会议，由先进人物现身说法，教育群众。会上还展览了妇女记工手册，比比谁出勤挣工多，比比谁养鸡生蛋大，比比谁的草帽辫编得又多又好，比谁家的杂面条既省粮又好吃。群众对这样生动灵活的宣传，感到莫大的兴趣，印象很深刻。（二）结合社会主义教育，运用辩论的方法，提高了群众的觉悟，改变了落后人、落后村的面貌。例如诗经村乡西刘庄村，妇女出勤率很低，红白喜事铺张浪费，部分妇女还有赌钱的恶习。运动中该村结合社会主义教育，选择了丁桂枝和刘兆有两户人口、劳力和收入相近似的家庭，进行了对比。丁桂枝家年年有吃有穿，日子过得挺舒畅，刘兆有却年年少吃没穿，愁眉不展。会上，展开了为什么刘兆有家粮食不够吃的辩论，妇女们一方面找漏洞，一方面也结合着交流了节约粮食的经验。这样经过大、小三十五次辩论，妇女们的觉悟大大提高了，妇女出勤率由20％提高到80％。（三）春节前针对群众铺张浪费的旧习俗，向青年妇女宣传节约过春节。经过宣传教育以后，李子口乡石家村，在除夕这一晚就节省了一千元左右。以上几种方法，经试验取得经验后，即运用县广播站、河间农民报、村广播台、黑板报、街头诗等各种宣传方式，向全县推广。除了运用各种宣传工具，传播经验外，还组织了参观、评比，全县规模的评比进行了两次。运动转向深透后，全县形成了人和人、队与队、社与社的竞赛热潮，作到了乡乡有先进，社社有模范，队队有典型。全县涌出村的积极分子一万二千余名，乡的积极分子一千二百三十九名，县的积极分子一百一十四名。并评出领导勤俭持家的模范干部周玉香、马秀女、李玉琴等三人为全县旗帜。
    经过全党动手，各级妇联的积极贯彻，勤俭光荣、浪费可耻的思想已普遍地在广大群众中树立起来。他们称“勤是摇钱树，俭是聚宝盆”。全县已有八万九千八百六十一户订了勤俭持家计划，占全县总户数的97％。在冬季兴修水利和积肥运动中有八万八千三百三十九名妇女投入劳动，占原有妇女整半劳力八万一千七百二十二名的108％。
    敢想敢干，发挥了妇女  在生产跃进中的作用
    在农业生产大跃进中，如何充分发挥妇女的劳动效能和特长，又能注意解决妇女的特有问题，这是大跃进中需要进一步研究的问题。县妇联在发动妇女投入建设，养猪积肥和学习耕作技术等项工作中，注意摸索了这方面的经验。
    冬季兴修水利中，县妇联分析了妇女的潜力，结合勤俭持家的宣传，向妇女提出了投资、投料、投劳力的号召，积极发动妇女响应“三投”。“三投”中投劳力是个中心问题。县妇联根据绝大部分妇女没有参加过这种重劳动的情况，提出了在完成水利建设的任务中要注意妇女的劳动保护和安全生产，同时，县妇联办公室深入现场，在挖渠工地上总结了男女分工分业的经验。具体的分工是男人打地面上的冻土，冻土挖开后，就由妇女挖冻土下面的松土，挖至两米深，再由男人继续深挖，妇女担任地上运土，部分妇女参加工地上烧水作饭等后勤工作。经过男女的合理分工，妇女担任着自己能胜任的工作，出活又多，还能保护妇女安全劳动。这个经验总结后，就向全县推广。因而妇女都积极投入水利建设，与男人一起完成了干渠三条，支渠二百九十一条，斗毛渠三万九千六百七十八条，打修水井一万一千一百眼的任务，共可浇地一百四十五万亩，基本上达到了水利化。
    “庄稼一枝花，全靠粪当家”养猪积肥是增产大跃进的主要措施之一。河间县在1957年就是猪只翻九番的跃进县，由春季二万余头猪到年底发展到十八万头。从二万到十八万这个数字的跃进中，妇女是充分发挥了自己的特长和作用，名副其实地担负养猪主力军的光荣任务。当时县委提出了扩大猪只十八万头，每只猪造肥十八车的计划，群众思想上是有顾虑的，认为喂猪缺乏饲料，小猪娃没有来源；猪瘟无法治。为了实现县委提出的养猪积肥的指标，县妇联针对群众存在的这种顾虑，积极地深入群众总结妇女的养猪经验，以姚天宫乡北中原村为试点，总结了代食品喂猪、防治猪瘟、配种保胎、集体养猪场中男女分工分业等经验，及时向全县推广。5月份配合有关部门召开了全县养猪积极分子大会。会上代表们充分交流和汇报了她们多年积累的养猪经验，提出一百五十余种粗饲料代食品。为了解决猪只的繁殖问题，特别由养猪能手金保国和耿三女介绍了她们创造的双猪配种方法，一胎能生二十只左右小猪娃，这个经验得到群众的欢迎。在加强饲养管理防止猪瘟问题上，由马秀女、杨秀治专门作了介绍，她们在饲养方法上，主要能做到按时按量，热天吃冷食，冬天吃温食，管理方法上注意猪圈的清洁卫生。事实是最能说服人的，通过这些经验介绍与推广，群众的顾虑逐渐打消。由于县妇联能及时地搜集总结了群众中多年的创造又推广到群众中去，保证了县委提出的养猪计划的实现，这里也显示了妇女在养猪上的才能。1958年为了达到养猪六十余万头的指标，根据集体饲养为主、家庭饲养为辅的方针，在原有七百零一个养猪场（其中妇女养猪场一百九十六个），妇女饲养员五百零八名的基础上，要求社社队队建立养猪场，妇女饲养员达到60％以上。在发展养猪的同时，妇女们通过“三抓”，积极投入积肥运动。三抓是：（一）多养猪勤垫圈；（二）夏秋季压绿肥，并提出“劳动下洼（田），背粪筐，回来青草满当当”的口号；（三）结合卫生运动，厕所、家具大搬家，小便单积，小灰单存，搞好家庭卫生。在积肥运动中，妇女成为积肥的主要力量。今年在保证亩施万斤肥中，妇女除积极参加集体积肥外，还从多方面挖掘肥源，保证妇女积肥占总积肥量的60％。
    为了解决妇女参加生产与带孩子的矛盾，县妇联发动群众普遍建立了托儿组织，截止4月中旬，全县已收托了四万七千余名孩子，占应受托儿童的97.6％，保证了三万八千余名母亲出勤，使全县妇女劳力的出勤率达到98％。
    为了提高妇女的劳动效能，县委已经提出了妇女向技术进军的问题。这样将使妇女在生产大跃进中从量到质来个飞跃。妇女们豪迈地说：“刀子山，钻一钻，是块石头也要碰它半个边。”在春耕播种山芋、棉花、玉米等作物中，她们已开始学会按新的操作规程播种，随着季节的发展，她们将会学会更多的新技术，在实际生产中取得成绩，获得经验。
    推行节育晚婚  提高了生产干劲
    在推行计划生育的工作中，县妇联了解到全县有一万八千二百零八个妇女（占生育年龄妇女总数的29％）因生育过多，不能参加生产。这充分说明：不在群众中大力推行节育、晚婚工作，将直接影响到群众的生产和生活的提高。
    县委领导上多次讨论了这一工作，以书记挂帅，全党动手的气魄，以贯彻宣传婚姻法运动的劲头，开展了大张旗鼓的宣传。在县人代会上作出决议，县成立了节育委员会，由县长任主任，乡、社也建立了节育组织。同时组织了六万余人的宣传大军，利用各种宣传工具，通过不同类型的会议，进行了大规模的宣传节育的好处，深入人心。在景和乡六十五名老年妇女诉苦会上，王仁山的母亲痛哭流涕地诉说了自己生养过多的痛苦，当她们听到卫生所长讲明了节育的好处以后，当场就有十二个老婆婆买了避孕套给儿媳用。在王雅义村召开的多子女夫妇座谈会上，采取了对比算账的办法，向群众进行了教育。李淑秀三口之家只有一个孩子，夫妇俩都参加劳动，全年分红三百元，生活富裕。刘兴恩六口之家有四个孩子，只有兴恩一人参加劳动，全年分红一百五十六元，生活困难，还要依靠国家救济。
    在未婚青年男女的座谈会上辩论了早婚害处和晚婚的好处。经过各种不同类型会议的宣传教育，群众不但消除了顾虑，扭转了“有人就有财，人多日子旺”“早生儿女早得济”等说法，而且她们从心眼里欢迎节育晚婚政策。
    紧随着宣传工作的普遍深广的发展，技术指导、工具供应也要跟上去。经过县乡逐级训练师资后，又由各生产队选拔群众拥护的已婚男女八千一百多名，全县分一百七十四片训练他（她）们，担任了三员（宣传、技术指导和工具推销），实行男教男，女教女，效果很好，并以他们为基础，建立了一百六十六个技术指导组，增设六十一个技术性指导门诊，形成全县节育指导网。
    关键在于领导
    中共河间县委是一贯重视妇女工作的。他们把发动妇女列为党的事业的一部分，同时又照顾到妇女群众的特点和妇联特殊作用的发挥。因此，在作法上，一方面贯彻男女一齐发动，全党作妇女工作，将妇联及上级提出有关妇女的重大工作纳入党的工作中，统一布置，统一检查，并教导妇联干部，结合中心工作进行妇女工作。如上述的勤俭持家、节育、开展托儿组织，保证妇女出勤等工作，都是纳入党的工作内容，推动全党动手贯彻的。另方面，又针对妇联的特殊作用和妇女群众的特点，在中心运动中，给妇联提出重点，放手地推动妇联创造发动妇女完成中心任务结合解决妇女特殊问题的经验，使妇联成为全党作妇女工作的核心力量，同样也丰富了中心工作的经验，促进中心工作的开展。县委并规定每月定期检查讨论妇女工作的制度，如勤俭持家运动中县委曾作过四次讨论。各级党委在政治领导，组织推动，人力物力方面对妇女工作都给予很大的支持与鼓舞。
