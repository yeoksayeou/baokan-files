New Children's Song

	Brother pushes the mill, sister makes the cake,
	I light the fire to entice the little ones;
	Dad is busy with production in the fields,
	Making a big cake for Dad.
	Dad is doing good work this year,
	Planting more grain and cotton.
	Wearing a medal, with a red flower pinned on,
	Everyone praises Dad,
	Mom's face turns rosy,
	And she just keeps kissing my little mouth.

    送个大粑给爸爸哥推磨，姐做粑，我来烧火引细伢；爸爸畈里忙生产，做个大粑给爸爸。爸爸今年劳动好，多种粮食和棉花。戴奖章，挂红花，人人都把爸爸夸，妈妈见了脸绯红，光是亲我的小嘴吧。
