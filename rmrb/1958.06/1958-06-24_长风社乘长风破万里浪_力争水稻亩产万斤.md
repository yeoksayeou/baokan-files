The Changfeng Cooperative Rides the Wind and Waves: Striving for 10,000 Jin Per Mu of Rice

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Hubei Daily, in the 200,000 mu high-yield rice demonstration area in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative, led by the famous agricultural labor model Guan Musheng, is striving to create a record of 10,000 jin per mu of rice this year. On the afternoon of the 17th, Comrade Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, inspected the production in this demonstration area and praised their daring and communist style.

The early rice and single-season late japonica rice of the Changfeng Cooperative are growing very well. The early rice is already more than two feet tall, dense and strong, and some have begun to bud and head, promising a great harvest. The cooperative members are also conducting bold experiments in the experimental fields to strive for high yields. Guan Musheng's experimental field plans to yield 10,060 jin per mu for the whole year; Zhao Cuiyun and Yu Xiaoying, known as the rice girls and cotton girls, plan to yield 10,160 jin per mu in their experimental field; the plan of youth captain Guan Mutang's experimental field is even higher: 5,000 jin per mu for Early Rice No. 16, 6,000 jin per mu for double-season late rice, plus 610 jin of previously harvested wheat, for a total of 11,610 jin. Zhao Cuiyun and Yu Xiaoying's cotton experimental field is also located here, with a target of 1,500 jin of seed cotton per mu. These fields are not far apart, and the large signs with production plans written on them face each other. They compete with each other on this battlefield every day, learning from each other, catching up with each other, and trying to surpass each other. The rice seedlings grow equally well and uniformly, and it is difficult to tell which is superior until the harvest and threshing.

When Comrade Wang Renzhong saw these experimental fields, he said: "A yield of 10,000 jin of rice per mu, this is the communist style of daring to think and daring to do. Since wheat can yield more than 4,000 jin per mu, why can't rice yield 10,000 jin per mu? Things are always like this: what you can imagine, you can achieve. Of course, this 'imagining' is not wild fantasy, but starting from reality, that is, so-called ideals. These young people and girls' 'imagining' are guaranteed by concrete measures. If these measures are earnestly implemented, it is entirely possible to yield 10,000 jin of rice per mu."

Before leaving, Comrade Wang Renzhong also said to Comrade Guan Musheng: "Old Guan, you must guide the young people and girls so that the crops in their experimental fields grow better than the crops in your own experimental field. It's not good if only your experimental field in the Changfeng Cooperative has a high yield. It is good only if the fields of the entire cooperative have high yields, or even higher yields than your experimental field, that is when it is considered you have led well." Comrade Guan Musheng replied: "Yes, I will definitely follow your advice. Not only will our cooperative achieve a large-scale balanced increase in production, but we will also carry out communist cooperation with other cooperatives and make progress together."

After inspecting the rice production in this demonstration area, Comrade Wang Renzhong and others believe that as long as they continue to work hard, overcome drought, and vigorously accumulate fertilizer, the plan of 2,000 jin per mu in this 200,000 mu high-yield demonstration area can be fully realized.

    长风社乘长风破万里浪
    力争水稻亩产万斤
    本报讯  据湖北日报消息：在湖北省孝感县二十万亩水稻高产示范区，著名农业劳动模范官木生领导的长风农业社，正在力争创造今年稻谷亩产万斤的高额丰产纪录。17日下午，在这个示范区查看生产的中共湖北省委第一书记王任重同志，称赞了他们这种敢想敢做的共产主义风格。
    长风社的早稻和一季晚粳都长得很好。早稻已经有两尺多高，密而且壮，有的开始打苞出穗，丰收大有希望。社员们还在试验田中进行争取高额丰产的大胆尝试。官木生的试验田规划全年亩产一万零六十斤；被称为水稻姑娘兼棉花姑娘的赵翠云和余小英的试验田规划亩产一万零一百六十斤；青年队长官木堂的试验田规划更高，早稻16号亩产五千斤，双季晚稻亩产六千斤，加上已经收割了的前茬大麦六百一十斤，共为一万一千六百一十斤。赵翠云和余小英的棉花试验田也在这里，指标是亩产籽棉一千五百斤。这几块田相距不远，写着生产规划的大牌子也脸对着脸。他们天天在这片战场上比武，你学我，我学你，你赶我，我赶你。稻苗长得一样好、一样齐，不到收割打场，很难分高低上下。
    王任重同志看到这些试验田时说：稻谷亩产万斤，这就是敢想敢做的共产主义风格。既然小麦能够亩产四千多斤，为什么稻谷不能够亩产万斤呢？事情总是这样：想得到就能做得到。当然，这“想”，并非胡思乱想，而是从实际出发，即所谓理想。这些青年、姑娘们的“想”，都有具体措施作保证，认真实行这些措施，就完全有可能亩产万斤稻谷。
    临别的时候，王任重同志还向官木生同志说：“老官哪，你要指导那些青年、姑娘们的试验田的庄稼都比你自己的试验田的庄稼长的好。长风社光你一个人的试验田高产，不能算好，全社的田都高产，甚至都比你的试验田高产，那才算你领导的好。”官木生同志回答说：“对，我一定照着你的意见办。不但我们社要大面积平衡增产，我们还要和别的社开展共产主义大协作，大家一同跃进。”
    在查看这个示范区水稻生产情况以后，王任重同志等认为，只要继续努力，战胜干旱，大搞积肥，这二十万亩高产示范区亩产二千斤的规划是完全可以实现的。
