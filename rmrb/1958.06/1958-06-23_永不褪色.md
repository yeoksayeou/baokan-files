    Never Fading

    The Shanghai Runhua Dyestuff Factory has successfully trial-produced reactive dyes. Currently, only the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and West Germany are capable of manufacturing this type of dye. This celebratory event demonstrates that under the wise leadership of the Party, China's dye industry is catching up with advanced international levels.

    The colorful and vibrant fabrics we use in our daily lives are created by distributing colors or patterns onto the fabric (cotton, linen, silk, wool, and rayon) through dyeing or printing with dyes. In other words, the dyeing or printing of fabrics is due to the bonding between the dye and the fiber.

    Regardless of the type of fiber or the type of dye, the bonding between them, with a few exceptions, is generally not strong. After exposure to sunlight, rain, washing with soapy water, or mechanical friction, the dye will come off the fiber. Therefore, after wearing clothes for a considerable period, fading will occur, often resulting in "the color fades before the clothes wear out."

    Is it possible to make clothes that never fade? People have been painstakingly exploring this for sixty years.

    If you place a small piece of chalk (calcium carbonate) in water and take it out after a while, then bake it in the fire or expose it to the sun, or even treat it with alkaline solution, its weight and properties will not undergo any major changes. The chemical explanation for this phenomenon is that the atoms that make up the molecules of matter have a strong attraction to each other, thus maintaining the inherent properties of the substance. Many substances in nature have this property.

    Suppose it were possible to create a strong and unchanging compound between the dye and the fiber, and this compound was insoluble in water, then it would withstand sunlight, rain, soap washing, and mechanical friction. Wouldn't that be a dye that never fades? This scientific hypothesis is the basic starting point for people to manufacture reactive dyes.

    Reactive dyes contain a crucial ingredient called a reactive chlorotriazine group. Its chemical properties are very active and can chemically react with hydrogen atoms in other molecules. The name "reactive dye" comes from this. Reactive dyes also contain a sulfonic acid group, which allows the dye to dissolve directly in water.

    According to some chemists, although the physical, chemical structure, and composition of cotton, linen, silk, wool, and rayon are not entirely the same, and there are many differences in properties, they all contain hydrogen atoms. In this way, the reactive chlorine atoms in the reactive dye can pull out the hydrogen atoms in the fabric, thereby forming a strong chain between the dye and the fiber, bringing them closely together and creating a fairly stable complex compound.

    The process of dyeing and printing fabrics with reactive dyes is quite simple and can be carried out at room temperature (30-50 degrees Celsius). After the fabric is dyed, it is treated in a sodium carbonate solution to neutralize the hydrochloric acid produced during dyeing. Other than that, no other chemical agents are needed. Finally, the excess dye is washed away, and it is done.

    If you put clothes dyed with reactive dyes in boiling soapy water, and also put in a white piece of clothing, after half an hour, take them out. The color on the dyed clothes has not come off at all, and the white fabric has not been stained with any color. This shows that the wash fastness of reactive dyes has reached an astonishing level. Other properties such as resistance to sunlight and mechanical friction also have the same fastness.

    In 1956, sixty years after people envisioned producing dyes that never fade, the United Kingdom was the first to successfully trial-produce reactive dyes. Subsequently, twenty-one varieties were produced. However, this old-牌 (established brand) imperialist country not only heavily promoted the excellent performance of this dye but also maintained absolute secrecy about the manufacturing method, attempting to monopolize the international dye market. However, the awakened Chinese people can accomplish anything. Two years later, in early 1958, under the Party's call to "catch up with Britain," Xi Xiangyun, a technician at the Shanghai Runhua Dyestuff Factory, after repeated explorations, finally produced reactive dyes. Within just a few months, we have produced thirty-five varieties, and the quality of these varieties has exceeded the quality of reactive dyes from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and West Germany. The never-fading printed fabrics dyed and printed with reactive dyes in our country will soon be sold in domestic and international markets.

    永不褪色
    寰元
    上海润华染料厂试制成功了活性染料。这种染料目前只有英国、瑞士、西德能够制造。这一值得庆贺的事件表明，我国的染料工业在党的英明领导下，正在赶上国际先进水平。
    我们生活中使用的五光十色、万紫千红的衣料，都是由染料通过染色或印花的手续，使色彩或花纹分布在织物（棉、麻、丝、毛及人造纤维）上而成的。换句话说，织物的染色或印花是由于染料和纤维之间的结合作用。
    不管是哪一种纤维，也不论是哪一类染料，它们之间的结合作用除了个别的以外，一般是并不牢固的。经过日晒、雨淋、肥皂水洗或机械摩擦后，染料就会从纤维上掉下来。所以衣服穿用一个相当时期之后，就会发生褪色现象，往往“衣服未烂色先消”。
    能不能使衣物永不褪色呢？人们为此苦苦探索了六十年。
    把一小块白垩（碳酸钙）放在水中，隔相当时间后取出，再把它放在火上烤或者阳光下去晒，甚至用碱液去处理，结果它的重量和性质不会发生什么重大的变化。这一现象从化学上解释是：构成物质分子的各原子之间具有强大的吸引力，因而能保持物质的本性不变。自然界里有不少的物质具有这种性质。
    假使能使染料和纤维之间也生成一种牢固不变的化合物，并且这种化合物不溶于水，那么不论是日晒、雨淋、皂洗、机械摩擦都能经得起，不就是永不褪色么？这一合乎科学的设想就是人们制造活性染料的基本出发点。
    活性染料中含有一个最重要的成份，叫做活性氯基。它的化学性质非常活泼，能和其他物质分子中的氢原子发生化学作用。活性染料的名称也是由此而来的。活性染料中还含有一个磺酸基团，它的作用是能使染料直接溶解于水。
    根据有些化学家的研究，棉麻丝毛及人造丝的物理、化学结构及成份虽然不尽相同，性质也有很多区别，但里边都含有氢原子。这样活性染料中的活性氯原子就能把织物中的氢原子拉出来，从而在染料和纤维之间形成了一根坚固的链索，使它们紧密地靠在一起，产生一种相当稳定的复杂化合物。
    用活性染料染印织物，手续相当简单，并且在常温（摄氏30度—50度）下即能进行。织物染色后再放在碳酸钠溶液中处理，以中和染色时产生的盐酸。除此以外，不需要其他的化学药品。最后洗去多余的染料就成了。
    如果把用活性染料染成的衣物，放在滚烫的肥皂水中，同时还放入一件白色的衣服，经过半个小时以后再把它们拿出来，染色衣物上的颜色一点都没有掉下，而白色织物也是一点颜色也没沾上去。这说明活性染料的水洗坚牢度已达到惊人的程度。其他如日晒、机械摩擦也具有同样的坚牢度。
    1956年，也就是人们设想生产永不褪色染料的六十年以后，英国第一个试制成功了活性染料。以后陆续生产了二十一种品种。但这个老牌的帝国主义国家一方面大肆吹嘘这种染料的优良性能，一方面却对制造方法保守绝对秘密，企图垄断国际染料市场。然而觉醒了的中国人民没有什么事情是做不到的，两年以后，1958年初，上海润华染料厂的技术员奚翔云在党的“赶上英国”的号召下，经过了多次的摸索，终于制成了活性染料，并在短短几个月内我们已生产了三十五种品种，而且这些品种的质量都已超过了英国、瑞士和西德的活性染料的质量。我国用活性染料染印的永不褪色的花布，不久即将行销于国内外市场了。
