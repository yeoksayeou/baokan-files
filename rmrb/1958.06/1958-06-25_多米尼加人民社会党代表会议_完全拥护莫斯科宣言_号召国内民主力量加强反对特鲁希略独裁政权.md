　　Xinhua News Agency, June 24th Dispatch from Buenos Aires: According to the Argentine weekly "Our Word," the first congress of the Dominican People's Socialist Party (Communist Party), recently held, expressed its complete endorsement of the Moscow Declaration.

　　The congress considered the Moscow Declaration to be "a declaration of historic significance, which, on an unshakable ideological basis, guarantees the strong unity of the international communist movement and determines the universal laws for building socialism in all countries." In reviewing the international situation, the congress pointed out that the bankruptcy of the Cold War policy pursued by large monopoly capital organizations and their governments is conducive to the development of the democratic cause in the Dominican Republic.

　　In discussing the domestic situation in the Dominican Republic, the congress pointed out that U.S. imperialism's control over the Dominican Republic has been further strengthened through new mining investments and the Trujillo regime's extensive concessions of military bases. The Trujillo regime, fostered and maintained by the United States, is implementing autocratic oppression. The congress called on the democratic forces in the Dominican Republic to expose the nature of the relationship between the Trujillo tyrannical regime and imperialism, and to expose and oppose the U.S. State Department's measures in supporting the dictatorial regime.

　　The congress welcomed the signs of democratic awakening appearing in the Dominican Republic. This awakening is occurring among university students and in the actions of some workers defending their rights. The congress believes that this is of great significance under the conditions of autocratic oppression enveloping the Dominican Republic. Only along this path can the poverty and terror policies implemented by the tyrannical regime be defeated. The congress called on all Dominican exiles and democratic forces in all countries to strengthen their support for the Dominican people's movement, contribute to its struggle, and stop the ever-increasing wave of terror of the Trujillo regime.

    多米尼加人民社会党代表会议
    完全拥护莫斯科宣言
    号召国内民主力量加强反对特鲁希略独裁政权
    新华社24日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：据阿根廷“我们的话”周报报道，最近举行的多米尼加人民社会党（共产党）第一次代表会议表示完全拥护莫斯科宣言。
    这次会议认为，莫斯科宣言是“具有历史意义的宣言，这个宣言在不可动摇的思想基础上保证了国际共产主义运动的坚强团结和确定了在一切国家中建设社会主义的普遍规律”。会议在审查国际局势的时候指出，大垄断资本组织和它们的政府所执行的冷战政策的破产有利于多米尼加的民主事业的发展。
    会议在讨论多米尼加的国内局势时指出，美帝国主义对多米尼加共和国的控制通过新的矿业投资和特鲁希略政权大量租让军事基地而更加强了，美国一手扶植起来并加以维持的特鲁希略政权实行专制压迫。会议号召多米尼加的民主力量揭露特鲁希略暴君政权同帝国主义之间的关系的性质，揭露和反对美国国务院支持独裁政权的措施。
    会议欢迎在多米尼加出现的民主觉醒的象征。这种觉醒产生在大学生中间以及一些保卫权利的工人的行动当中。会议认为，在笼罩着多米尼加的专制压迫的条件下，这件事具有重大意义。只有沿着这条道路才能击败暴君政权所执行的贫困和恐怖政策。会议号召一切多米尼加流亡者和世界各国的民主力量加强支援多米尼加人民的运动，为它的斗争作出贡献，制止特鲁希略政权有加无已的恐怖浪潮。
