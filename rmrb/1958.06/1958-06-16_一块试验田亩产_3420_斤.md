Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 14th: The Kongcun Agricultural Cooperative of Xili Township, Nanhe County, Hebei Province, planted 1,086 mu of wheat this year, with a total output of over 1.39 million jin, averaging 1,280 jin per mu. Among them, the 3.435 mu experimental plot planted by Guo Shuren, Secretary of the Nanhe County Party Committee, and Wang Youren, Director of the Kongcun Agricultural Cooperative, produced a total of 11,749 jin and 14 liang of wheat, with an average yield of 3,420 jin and 10 liang per mu.

When the wheat from these three-plus mu experimental plots was harvested, the County Party Committee sent special personnel to supervise the separate harvesting and threshing. During the harvesting and threshing period, Zhi Yigeng, Director of the Wheat Cultivation Office of the Hebei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wei Yunrui from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Guo Shuren, Secretary of the County Party Committee, Zheng Yingfan, Director of the County Public Security Bureau, Li Ping, Deputy Director of the County People's Court, Yao Wan’yin, Director of the County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, Han Jinting, Secretary of the Township Party Committee, and others weighed and inspected the yield.

The wheat harvest greatly boosted the morale of the cooperative members. They reflected that the experimental plot yielding over 3,000 jin per mu proves that the land has great potential. The wheat in the experimental plot was severely lodged, yet it still yielded so much, indicating that it is entirely possible to learn from this experience, strengthen management, and strive for even greater harvests next year. All five production teams in the cooperative have planned to cultivate several mu of experimental plots.

    一块试验田亩产3420斤
    新华社天津14日电　河北省南和县西里乡孔村农业社今年种的一千零八十六亩小麦，总产量一百三十九万多斤，平均亩产达到一千二百八十斤。其中，中共南和县委书记郭树仁和孔村农业社主任王友仁二人种的三亩四分三厘五试验田，共产麦一万一千七百四十九斤十四两，平均亩产达到了三千四百二十斤十两。
    这三亩多试验田的麦子在收割时，县委派专人监督进行单收单打。在收打期间，河北省农业科学研究所麦作室主任智一耕、省农林厅魏云瑞、县委书记郭树仁、县公安局长郑英凡、县法院副院长李平、县农林局长姚万银、乡党委书记韩金廷等作了过秤验收。
    小麦丰收，社员们情绪非常高涨。他们反映，这亩产三千多斤的试验田，证明土地潜力还很大。试验田麦子倒伏了很多，还收了这么些麦子，说明了明年接受教训，加强管理，争取更大的丰收是完全可能的。全社五个生产队，每队都已计划搞几亩试验田。
