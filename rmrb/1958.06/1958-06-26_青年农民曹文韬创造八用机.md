    Young Farmer Cao Wentao Creates Eight-Use Machine

    In the agricultural product processing hall of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, there is a light and ingenious machine that can shred sweet potatoes, slice sweet potatoes, grind sweet potato flour, chop pig feed, thresh rice, thresh wheat, thresh sorghum, and pick peanuts. The inventor of this eight-use machine is an ordinary young farmer—Cao Wentao. He has now been hired as a member of the Science Work Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Committee.

    Cao Wentao is only twenty-four years old this year. He is the deputy secretary of the Communist Party branch of the Leyu Agricultural Cooperative in Hengshi Township, Anhua County, Hunan Province, and also the deputy secretary of the township's Communist Youth League general branch. He was recently transferred to the Anhua Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing and Repair Factory as a technician.

    In the past, because his family was very poor, Cao Wentao only studied for four years before dropping out of school to participate in agricultural production at home. In August 1957, with the support of the Party, he spent fifteen days creating the eight-use machine. Before this, he also created a water-lifting machine, a lime-spreading device for paddy fields, a suction-pressure water pump, a two-use harrow, a bamboo tube sprayer, an animal-powered tea kneading machine, and a rice combined transplanter.

    青年农民曹文韬创造八用机
    在全国农具展览会的农产品加工馆里有一部轻便灵巧的机器，既能刨薯丝、切薯片、磨薯粉、铡猪草，又能打稻、打麦、打高粱、摘花生。发明这部八用机的是一个普通的青年农民——曹文韬。他现在被聘为湖南省人民委员会科学工作委员会委员。
    曹文韬今年只二十四岁，是湖南省安化县横市乡乐余农业社中共支部的副书记，又是乡里共青团总支的副书记，最近调安化农业机械制造修配厂当技术员。
    曹文韬过去因为家里很穷，只读四年书就失了学，在家参加农业生产。1957年8月，他在党的支持下，用十五天时间创造了八用机。在这以前，他还创造了升水机、水田撒石灰器、吸压式抽水筒、两用耙、竹筒喷雾器、畜力揉茶机和水稻联合插秧机。
