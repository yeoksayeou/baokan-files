Article 2 The agricultural tax shall be levied using a proportional tax system.

Article 3 The following units and individuals engaged in agricultural production and having agricultural income are taxpayers of agricultural tax and shall pay agricultural tax in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations:

(3) Individual farmers and other citizens with agricultural income;

(4) State-owned farms, local state-owned farms, and joint state-private farms;

(3) Income from horticultural crops;

(4) Other income subject to agricultural tax as stipulated or approved by the State Council.

Article 5 Agricultural production cooperatives and other cooperatives engaged in agriculture shall pay agricultural tax as a unit; other taxpayers shall pay agricultural tax according to their operating units.

Chapter II Calculation of Agricultural Income

Article 6 The calculation standards for agricultural income are as follows:

(1) Income from planting grain crops shall be calculated based on the normal annual yield of grain crops;

(2) Income from planting tuber crops shall be calculated based on the normal annual yield of grain crops on equivalent land;

(3) Income from planting cotton, hemp, tobacco leaves, oil crops, and sugar crops shall be calculated with reference to the normal annual yield of grain crops;

(4) The calculation standards for income from horticultural crops, other cash crops, and other income subject to agricultural tax as stipulated or approved by the State Council shall be determined by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

All kinds of agricultural income listed in items (1), (2), and (3) of the first paragraph of this article shall be converted into the local staple grain, calculated in jin (市斤); the conversion ratio shall be determined by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

Article 7 The normal annual yield shall be assessed based on the natural conditions of the land and the general management situation in the area, according to the yield in normal years. The assessment of normal annual yield should not be too high for those who have significantly increased production by actively adopting measures to increase production and using advanced experience.

Article 8 When assessing the normal annual yield, for land where the unit area yield has been increased by the taxpayer through the construction of farmland water conservancy projects and soil and water conservation projects, the normal annual yield shall be assessed with reference to the normal yield before the improvement, if the benefit has not been realized for three years.

Article 9 After the normal annual yield is assessed, it shall not be increased within five years if the unit area yield is increased due to diligent cultivation and improved management; it shall not be decreased if the unit area yield is reduced due to negligent cultivation.

Chapter III Tax Rate

Article 10 The national average tax rate is stipulated as 15.5% of the normal annual yield; the average tax rates for each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government shall be separately stipulated by the State Council based on the national average tax rate, combined with the different economic conditions of each region.

Article 11 The People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government shall, based on the average tax rate stipulated by the State Council, combine with the economic conditions of the various regions under their jurisdiction to separately stipulate the average tax rate for autonomous prefectures and the tax rates for counties, autonomous counties, and cities under their jurisdiction; the tax rates for counties, autonomous counties, and cities under the jurisdiction of autonomous prefectures shall be separately stipulated by the People's Committees of autonomous prefectures based on the average tax rate stipulated by the People's Committee at the next higher level, combined with the economic conditions of the various regions under their jurisdiction.

If the economic conditions of the various regions under the jurisdiction of a county, autonomous county, or city vary greatly and it is not appropriate to levy tax according to a single tax rate, the People's Committee of the county, autonomous county, or city may separately stipulate the tax rates for the various regions under its jurisdiction based on the average tax rate stipulated by the People's Committee at the next higher level, and implement it after reporting it to the People's Committee at the next higher level for approval.

Article 12 The tax rate stipulated by the People's Committee at the county level or above for the regions under its jurisdiction shall not exceed 25% of the normal annual yield.

Article 13 In addition to being calculated at the same tax rate as agricultural production cooperatives in the area, the agricultural tax payable by individual farmers shall be subject to an additional tax ranging from 10% to 50% based on different economic conditions. No additional tax shall be levied on individual farmers who lack labor and have difficulties in life.

Article 14 The People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government may, with the approval of the People's Congress at the same level, levy local surcharges along with the agricultural tax in order to handle the needs of local public welfare undertakings.

The local surcharge shall generally not exceed 15% of the agricultural tax payable by the taxpayer; in areas where the planting of cash crops and horticultural crops is relatively concentrated and the profits are higher than those from planting grain crops, the proportion of the local surcharge may be higher than 15%, but shall not exceed 30%.

Chapter IV Preferences and Reductions/Exemptions

Article 15 Agricultural income obtained by taxpayers who legally reclaim wasteland or expand cultivated land area by other methods shall be exempt from agricultural tax for one to three years from the year of income.

Agricultural income obtained by immigrants who reclaim wasteland shall be exempt from agricultural tax for three to five years from the year of income.

Article 16 Newly planted or newly restored mulberry gardens, tea gardens, orchards, and other economic forests on mountain land by taxpayers shall be exempt from agricultural tax for three to seven years from the year of income.

(1) Land used for agricultural experiments by agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural schools;

(2) Scattered small plots of land beside houses where crops are grown.

Article 18 If a taxpayer's crops are reduced due to floods, droughts, wind, hail, or other natural disasters, the agricultural tax shall be reduced or exempted according to the degree of reduction. The methods for reduction and exemption shall be stipulated by the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

Article 19 The following areas may have their agricultural tax reduced with the decision of the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government:

After review and verification by the People's Committees of counties, autonomous counties, and cities, the tax amount shall be calculated according to the tax rate, and a tax payment notice shall be issued to the taxpayer as proof of tax payment.

Article 23 Agricultural tax shall be collected in two seasons, summer and autumn.

For mileage exceeding the mandatory transportation mileage, transportation costs shall be paid for the exceeded mileage according to the local general freight rate.

When stipulating the taxpayer's mandatory transportation mileage, appropriate consideration should be given to mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation.

Article 27 If a taxpayer finds that there are inaccurate investigations, unfair evaluations, miscalculations, or incorrect collections in the work of collecting agricultural tax, they may request a review and reconsideration from the People's Committees of townships, ethnic townships, and towns. If the taxpayer still disagrees with the results of the review and reconsideration, they may request a review from the People's Committee at the next higher level.
