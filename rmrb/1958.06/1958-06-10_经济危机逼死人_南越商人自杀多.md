Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 9th: The deepening economic difficulties and market slump in South Vietnam are causing many businessmen and entrepreneurs to commit suicide.

According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, citing Saigon newspapers, a South Vietnamese construction contractor, Chen Tinghe, recently drove his private car into the Pingli River near Saigon and committed suicide due to business difficulties.

Saigon newspapers also reported many other suicide cases of South Vietnamese businessmen this year, including an import and export merchant who jumped from a building, a shoemaker who committed suicide by taking poison, and a silk merchant who burned himself to death with gasoline.

South Vietnam's film industry is on the verge of collapse due to the heavy taxes levied by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and the exclusion by foreign, especially American, films.
