    The Washington "Saturday Evening Post" recently published a lengthy dispatch from Belgrade by its editor, Elser Hauser, after the Seventh Congress of the South Communist Party, entitled "Is Our Bet on Yugoslavia Paying Off?" It reveals how the Tito group's behavior suits the policy needs of U.S. imperialists.

    This American bourgeois newspaper editor, who visited Yugoslavia more than a decade ago, found that Yugoslavia has changed now, "everything is in turmoil." He said: "Western tourists still find this place a bit monotonous, the people are poorly dressed, and the stores don't have many varieties of goods." "...Although the living standards of the general masses are not high, Western tourists will praise the shops full of all kinds of valuable and pleasing goods, and finally they call Yugoslavia 'Little America'." In Belgrade, "there is no feeling of being closed off at all. The mass rallies that used to make people uneasy are gone. There is no sound of trumpets and drums, and no one intends to make your head dizzy. Tito himself often spends a lot of time on the remote Brioni Island, enjoying the Adriatic sun with his family, friends, dogs and horses."

    The American editor then asked: "What value does Tito have for us (the United States)?"

    He then answered this question: "The United States has so far invested nearly $1.5 billion in Tito's 'independence': about $700 million in economic aid, plus $780 million in military aid." In recent years, U.S. "aid" "has been almost entirely our surplus agricultural products, such as wheat, cotton, fats, etc. This year, seven-tenths of the flour in every loaf of bread consumed in Yugoslavia comes from the United States."

    Hauser recounted that since Tito's break with the Cominform, the United States has "quietly intervened" and "has been helping him survive." "From the beginning, the United States made it quite clear that it did not expect direct repayment. But in the first few years after the war, Tito gave the United States generous rewards. He closed the southern border, prohibiting the Greek Communist army from taking refuge and reorganizing on his territory, thereby accelerating the defeat of the Greek Communists; he agreed to resolve the thorny Trieste issue; he released Archbishop Stepinac, which was clearly a gesture of friendship towards the West. In 1954, he signed the Balkan Pact with Greece and Turkey (both countries are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization)," thus establishing a "connection between Yugoslavia and the Western defense system."

    The editor said that Tito "used back pain as an excuse to refuse for the first time to go to Moscow to attend the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Lenin Revolution." At the same time, a resolution was to be signed during the celebration, "Yugoslavia is the only one of the thirteen communist countries in the world that refused to sign." "Tito is so deeply disgusted with merely suggesting the signing of this kind of document, because it betrays the basic principles he advocates. Soon after, he let the Central Committee of the South Communist Party call the Moscow resolution 'wrong,' which is a militant word in Marxist language. Then came the firecracker set off at the congress last month."

    The editor said: The Yugoslav state has made concessions to certain things that seem to him to be more in line with "human nature," that is, in line with capitalism. For example, in 1953, Yugoslav farmers were allowed to leave collective farms. Today, about 90% of the arable land is cultivated by individual farmers, who can own no more than twenty-five hectares of land.

    Hauser wrote: "Although the Yugoslav leaders have increased their aversion to dialectics," "they also have to quote Marx and Lenin to justify what they are doing when necessary."

    The editor said: "Tito himself is very aware of his appeal and is skillfully using it." "Tito is consciously exporting Titoism, with the aim of turning the consolidated Soviet bloc (the socialist camp in the eyes of the West) into a loosely coupled federal organization, in which the leadership of the Kremlin (the role of the Soviet Union as the center of unity of the socialist camp in the eyes of the West) will be reduced to nothing." A senior Yugoslav official told him, "Don't forget, we have to play a role in Eastern Europe, which no one can replace."

    The editor said: Yugoslavia "today the climate has changed, and the breeze is coming from the West." Yugoslavs "are the object of American propaganda programs, which move them through speeches, documentaries, and short television programs. They eagerly devour the works of our major writers. They meet and talk with our experts and technicians." Therefore, this "cannot but make people feel that this is a Cold War victory on our side."

    The editor concluded: "Is this a marriage of convenience? Of course it is. But it seems that Tito's interests are consistent with the interests of the United States for a long time to come. As long as we maintain a good relationship with him, we (referring to the United States and Yugoslavia) are the only secret partner whose purpose is to undermine the Kremlin's control over Eastern Europe (referring to undermining the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union). As an American observer said, 'As long as we are here, we are moving forward.' Judging from Tito's method of condemning Moscow last month, that is correct."

### 美“星期六晚邮报”评美南关系  美国的赌注是上算的

    美“星期六晚邮报”评美南关系
    美国的赌注是上算的
    本报讯　华盛顿“星期六晚邮报”最近刊载了它的编辑埃尔?斯特·豪塞尔在南共召开七大后从贝尔格莱德写的一篇题为“我们对南斯拉夫的赌注是否上算？”的长篇通讯，透露了铁托集团的行为怎样适合美帝国主义者的政策的需要。
    这位十多年前到过南斯拉夫的美国资产阶级报纸的编辑，发现现在南斯拉夫变样了，“一切都在动荡中。”他说：“西方来的旅客仍旧发现这个地方有点单调，人民穿得很不好，商店里货物品种也不多。”“……尽管一般人民群众的生活水平并不高，西方的旅客会赞扬摆满了各种贵重的、令人赏心悦目的商品的商店，最后他们管南斯拉夫叫‘小美国’。”在贝尔格莱德，“丝毫也不使人感到闭塞。旧日不能使人们安宁的群众大会没有了。没有喇叭铜鼓的声音，也没有人打算吵得你头昏脑胀。铁托本人常常在老远的布里俄尼岛上消磨很多时间，和他的家属、朋友、狗和马一起欣赏亚得里亚海上的太阳。”
    这位美国编辑接着问道：“铁托对我们（美国）有什么价值呢？”
    他接着又回答了这个问题：“美国到现在为止，对铁托的‘独立’，投资了将近十五亿美元：约七亿美元的经济援助，加上七亿八千万美元的军事援助。”近几年来，美“援”“几乎全是我们的剩余农产品，例如小麦、棉花、脂肪等。今年南斯拉夫消费的每一块面包中有十分之七的面粉是来自美国。”
    豪塞尔追述道：从铁托和共产党情报局决裂时起，美国就“悄悄地干预”，“一直帮助他能过下去。”“从一开始美国就相当明确地表示美国并不期望直接的偿还。但是在战后最初几年内，铁托给了美国优厚的报答。他封闭了南希边境，禁止希腊共产党的军队在他的领土上避难和整顿，从而加速了希腊共产党人的失败；他同意解决辣手的的里雅斯特问题；他释放了斯提皮纳奇大主教，这明显地是一个对西方友好的姿态。1954年他和希、土签订了巴尔干条约（这两个国家都是北大西洋公约成员国）”，从而使得南斯拉夫“和西方防御体系之间建立了联系”。
    这位编辑说，铁托“以背痛为借口第一次拒绝到莫斯科去参加纪念列宁革命的四十周年的邀请。”同时在庆祝的时候要签署一项决议，“南斯拉夫是世界上十三个共产主义国家中的唯一拒绝签署的国家。”“对于仅仅建议签署这一类文件，铁托是这样地深恶痛绝，因为这样就背弃他所主张的基本原则。不久以后，他就让南共中央把莫斯科决议说成‘错误’的，这是马克思主义语言中一个具有战斗意义的字眼。然后接着就是上个月在代表大会上放了一个鞭炮。”
    这位编辑说：南斯拉夫国家已经向某些在他看来比较符合“人性”也就是符合资本主义的东西作了让步。例如，1953年，允许南斯拉夫农民脱离集体农庄。今天大约90％的可耕地是由个体农民耕种，个体农民可以拥有不超过二十五公顷的土地。
    豪塞尔写道：“虽然南斯拉夫的领袖们增加了他们对于辩证法的厌恶”，“但是在必要的时候，他们也要引用马克思和列宁来为他们做的事情辩护。”
    这位编辑说：“铁托自己很清楚地意识到他的吸引，并且很巧妙地在利用它。”“铁托是在有意识的输出铁托主义，目的是想把巩固的苏联集团（西方眼里的社会主义阵营）变成一种松弛结合的联邦组织，在那样的组织中将把克里姆林宫的领导（西方眼里的苏联作为社会主义阵营团结中心的作用）减为乌有。”一位南斯拉夫高级官员对他说，“不要忘记，我们要在东欧起作用，这是任何人不能代替的”。
    这位编辑说：南斯拉夫“今天气候起了变化，微风是来自西方”。南斯拉夫人“是美国的宣传节目的对象，这些节目通过演说、纪录影片和简短的电视节目等感动他们。他们迫切地吞食着我们主要作家的作品。他们和我们的专家、技术人员会面，谈话。”因此，这“不能不使人感觉到这是我们方面的一个冷战胜利。”
    这位编辑最后说：“这是一次利害的结合吗？当然是的。但是，看来是，铁托的利益在将来很长时期内与美国的利益是一致的。只要同他保持良好的关系，我们（指美国和南斯拉夫）就是那个目的在于破坏克里姆林宫对东欧的控制（指破坏以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结）的唯一的秘密的伙伴。正如一个美国观察家所说，‘只要我们在这里，我们就在前进。’从上月铁托谴责莫斯科的方法上来判断，那是对的。”
