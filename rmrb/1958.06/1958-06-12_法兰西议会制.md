    French Parliamentary System
    Q: How many houses does the French parliament have? What are the powers of the parliament? How many seats do the Communists hold in each house? Reader Jia Wen
    A: The French parliament has two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate of the Republic. There is also the Parliament of the French Federation, elected by overseas colonies and member states of the Federation.
    The National Assembly, or lower house, has the power to: vote on declarations of war, legislate and ratify treaties, pass budgets, authorize the formation of cabinets, overthrow cabinets, and jointly elect the President with the Senate of the Republic. Members are directly elected by universal suffrage by region. The National Assembly currently has 584 seats, of which the Communist Party and the Republican Union for Progress hold 148, ranking first.
    The Senate of the Republic, or upper house, has the power to: jointly elect the President with the National Assembly, review, pass, reject or amend bills initially passed by the National Assembly, but the National Assembly can still make the final decision. Members are indirectly elected by electoral colleges in each province and city. It currently has 320 seats, of which the Communist Party holds 15.
    The Parliament of the French Federation only has the right to make proposals and is practically a mere formality. The parliament has a total of 175 seats, of which the French Communist Party and progressives hold 12.

    法兰西议会制
    问：法国的议会分几院？议会权限如何？共产党在各院中占几席？　读者　贾文
    答：法国议会分两院，即国民议会和共和国参议院。另有由包括海外殖民地和联邦成员国选举产生的法兰西联邦议会。
    国民议会，即下院，其权限为：表决宣战，立法及批准条约，通过预算，授权组阁，推翻内阁，与共和国参议院会同选举总统。议员是按区域直接由普选产生的。国民议会中现有席位五百八十四席，共产党和进步共和联盟拥有一百四十八席，占第一位。
    共和国参议院即上院，其权限为：与国民议会会同选举总统，审查、通过、否定或修改国民议会初读通过的议案，但国民议会仍可作出最后决定。议员由各省市选举团间接选出。现共有三百二十个席位，共产党占十五席。
    法兰西联邦议会只有提议权，实际上形同虚设。该议会共有议席一百七十五席，法国共产党及进步分子占十二席。
