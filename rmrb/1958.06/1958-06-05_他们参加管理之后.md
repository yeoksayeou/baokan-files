    Nanjing Machine Tool Factory—In the processing workshop, in the less than half a month since the workers began participating in management, an unprecedented vigorous and upward-looking atmosphere has emerged in production.

    Having a Clear Picture and Knowing What’s What
    The workers in the grinding machine group were the first in the entire workshop to participate in management. The group leader, Wang Cailin, is also a capable and meticulous group planner. He breaks down the plan all the way to each machine and each worker, first letting them develop their own individual plans and raise their own difficulties. Before work every day, Wang Cailin's first task is to inspect each machine. He knows which grinder is progressing quickly, which grinder has insufficient tasks, which grinder has problems, and who has difficulties in their work, even before the workers report it to him. For example, the tool grinder was planned to complete 801 work hours in May, which was impossible to achieve based on the machine's capability. Zhou Huaguang and Chen Xigui, who were responsible for this grinder, discussed it and came up with several tricks to improve efficiency, but they could only complete 700 hours. Wang Cailin, knowing they had real difficulties, decided to transfer a worker from the group to support them, changing the two shifts to three shifts, making up for the shortfall of 100 hours. The group also had a newly assigned grinder with only 142 planned work hours in May. Wang Cailin, knowing that this machine had insufficient tasks, actively contacted other workshops and received 135 hours of collaborative work, which not only supported others but also fulfilled the machine's task. It was also on this grinder that a highly precise processing part, the "boring row," was received last week. This part was thin and long, making it difficult to handle. The young worker Ma Kangxiang was responsible for processing this part. He explored it for a long time but couldn't manage it well. Wang Cailin discovered this during inspection and quickly transferred the technician Feng Huasheng from his shift to organize a three-person technical mutual aid group. After working on it for half a day and a night, they finally completed it, and the quality was fully qualified.

    Red and Black Characters on the Progress Chart
    In the milling machine group, the most eye-catching things are the production progress chart posted on the wall and the dozens of work hour record cards hanging along the wall. Every day, after work, the workers record their daily work on their record cards. The group statistician then registers each person's performance on the production progress chart. Whoever completes or exceeds the quota is written in red, and whoever falls short is written in black. It is these red and black characters that attract the attention of all the workers in the group and stimulate their sense of responsibility for completing the plan. In the less than ten days since this chart was posted on the wall, several touching events have already occurred:

    Jin Suying is a first-level apprentice in the group. Because her operation was not skilled enough, her work hours were always in deficit in the past. On the first day the chart was posted, she challenged Hou Shiying, who was more technically skilled than her, and secretly resolved to catch up with her. That night, she worked hard for six hours and finally completed 33 hours of work. The next day, her achievement was recorded in conspicuous red characters on the chart. She stood in front of the chart and stared at it for a long time, her heart feeling warm. Back at the machine, she thought of a way to change the angle of the milling cutter and reduce the wear of the cutter. A week later, one night, she completed 55 hours of work in eight hours, and the quality was also 100% qualified. Now she is the new record creator with the most excess work hours in the entire group.

    Those who have black characters recorded on the chart also receive cordial care from everyone in the group. Liang Zhenghai and Jing Guanghua have not completed their quota for several days, and the black characters on the chart have formed a line. Li Yongshun and two other workers in the same group posted a big-character poster for them, which read:

    "Liang Zhenghai and Jing Guanghua, the owners of 03-102, you are the main key to the group and the production group leaders. How can you have such a large deficit in work hours (more than 100 hours)? Please find the reasons quickly and take urgent measures. We believe you will not fall behind, catch up quickly!" This big-character poster was both a spur and an encouragement. The two production group leaders felt particularly cordial after reading it. Liang Zhenghai thought to himself, "When workers participate in management, they are really serious about running the house. In the past, they would not have known how much we did at all, and even if they knew there was a deficit, they would not have criticized us so frankly."

    Friendship Between Brother Groups
    "Consistent external action planning, consistent internal unity and mutual assistance." This is the common language and aspiration of the shaft grinding and sleeve grinding brother groups in the grinding machine group. In order to ensure that everyone has work to do and that parts are delivered to the warehouse on time, they have launched a comprehensive friendly cooperation activity. Whoever completes the delivery task quickly will help others complete the delivery task. Which machine is waiting for work, help other machines work. Recently, the sleeve grinding group had a batch of 6041 hollow shafts. This type of hollow shaft has three processes, and only one grinder can do it. The workshop assigned a quota of 15 pieces to be delivered to the warehouse every day, but the capacity of this grinder is only 11 or 12 pieces per day at most. In the past, they had to postpone the task if they couldn't complete it. Now, the shaft grinding group helps them process it, and they quickly completed the delivery task. The assemblers no longer nag them from behind. Zhou Huaguang of the grinding machine group used to prefer to sit and chat. He never wanted to do the extra work assigned to him by the section chief, but now it's different. When he has free time, he also takes the initiative to help comrades on neighboring grinders with preparatory work.

    There are many more such fresh things that can be found. The workers almost unanimously said, "What moved us the most about decentralizing management power is the Party's trust in us workers. The Party fully believes that we have this awareness and this ability to manage our factory even better." (Attached picture)

    After the workers of the Fifth Group of Turners in the Third Workshop of the Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory participated in management, they successively created and improved more than 20 kinds of advanced tools.

　　他们参加管理之后
　　本报记者　张竞
    南京机床厂——加工车间的几个小组，在工人参加管理还不到半个月，生产上已经出现了从来没有过的蓬勃向上的气象。
    眼里有数，心里有底
    磨床小组的工人是全车间最早参加管理的。小组长王才林也是一个能干而且细心的小组计划员。他把计划一直分到每部机床每个工人身上，先让他们自己订出个人规划，也提出自己的困难。每天上班前，王才林的第一件工作就是到每部机床去检查一次，那一部磨床进度快，那一部磨床任务不足，谁的磨床出了毛病，谁的工作有困难，不等工人向他反映，他都眼里有数，心里有底。像工具磨床上，5月份计划要完成八百零一个工时，如果按这部床子的能力是无论如何达不到的。负责这部磨床的周华光和陈锡贵两人接到计划后，商量了一番，找了好几个提高效率的窍门，还只能完成七百小时。王才林知道他们确有实际困难，就决定在本小组抽调一个工人去支援，把两班改成三班，补足了一百小时的缺额。小组还有一部新排的磨床，5月份的计划工时只有一百四十二小时，王才林知道这部床子任务不足，就主动跑到别的车间去联系，接到了一百三十五小时的协作件，既支援了别人，也满足了机床的任务。也就是在这部磨床上，上星期接到了一件精密度很高的加工件——“搪排”，这个零件又细又长，很不容易掌握。负责加工这个零件的是青年工人马康祥，他一个人摸索了好久，怎么也摆弄不好，王才林在检查时发现了，赶紧把自己对班的技工冯华生调去，组织了一个三人技术互助组，整整琢磨了半天一夜，终算做好了，而且质量完全合格。
    进度表上红黑字
    在铣床组，最引人注目的是墙上贴的一张生产进度表和沿墙挂着的十几块工时记录牌。每天，工人下班后，在自己的记录牌上记下自己一天的工作情况。小组统计员再把每个人的成绩登记到生产进度表上去，谁完成或超额都写上红字，谁差额就写上黑字。就是这些红字黑字，吸引了全小组工人的注视，激发了他们的完成计划的责任心。这张图表贴上墙还不到十天，已经出现了好几件动人的事情：
    金素英是小组的一个一级学员，因为操作不够熟练，过去工时总是有差额，图表上墙的第一天，她就和技术比她高的侯世英挑战，暗自下了决心非赶上她不可。那天晚上，她苦苦干了六小时，终于完成了三十三小时的工作量，第二天，图表上就用显目的红字记下了她的成绩，她站在图表面前，凝视了好久，心里热呼呼的，回到机床上，她又想办法改变了铣刀的角度，减少了刀子的磨损，一星期以后的一个晚上，她又在八小时内完成了五十五小时的任务，质量也是百分之百的合格。现在她已是全组工时超额最多的新记录创造者了。
    在图表上记下黑字的，在小组里同样受到大家亲切的关怀。梁正海和经光华已经好几天没有完成定额了，图表上的黑字联成了一条线。同组的李永顺等三个工人就给他们贴出了一张大字报，上面写着：
    “03—102的主人梁正海、经光华，你们是小组的主要关键，又是生产小组长，你们竟差额这么多工时（一百多小时）怎么办？请你们迅速找原因，采取紧急措施。相信你们是不会落后的，快迎头赶上吧！”这张大字报又是鞭策，又是鼓励，两个生产组长看了心里感到格外亲切。梁正海心里想：“工人参加管理，当家可认真。要是过去，他们根本就不会知道我们做了多少，即使明知有差额，也不会这样直率地批评我们的。”
    兄弟小组的友谊
    “对外行动规划一致，对内团结互助一致”。这是磨床组的轴磨和套磨两个兄弟小组共同的语言和心愿。为了做到人人不等工，零件如期交库，他们已经展开了一个全面的友谊的协作活动。谁交库任务完成的快，谁就去帮助别人完成交库任务。那一部机床等工，就帮助别的机床工作。最近套磨小组有一批6041空心轴，这种空心轴有三道工序，只有一部磨床做，车间下达指标每天需要交库十五件，但这一部磨床的能力每天最多做十一、二件，过去完不成只好拉任务，现在，轴磨组帮他们加工，很快就完成了交库任务，装配工再也不钉在屁股后面催了。磨床组的周华光，过去宁可坐着聊天，工段长分配给他的外活他是从来不愿干的，现在可不同了。他有空还主动帮助邻近磨床上的同志做准备工作。
    像这样新鲜的事，还可以找到很多，工人们几乎异口同声地说：“管理权下放使我们最感动的是党对我们工人的信任。党完全相信我们有这份觉悟，有这份能力把自己的工厂管理得更加好。”（附图片）
