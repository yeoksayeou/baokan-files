The China Welfare Institute's twentieth anniversary falls on June 14, 1958. From its establishment as the China Defense League in Hong Kong in 1938, through the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and after liberation to the present, the China Welfare Institute, under the leadership of its founder and leader, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, has been closely linked to the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people, contributing its strength to the Chinese people's revolutionary struggles and socialist construction.

The twenty-year history of the China Welfare Institute can be divided into four stages:

(1) The period of the China Defense League in Hong Kong from June 1938 to December 1941:

In 1938, the flames of aggression of Japanese imperialism raged fiercely. After the rapid retreat of Chiang Kai-shek's army, they frantically attacked the central and southern regions, and the national crisis was profound.

In order to win national independence and resolutely support the War of Resistance, Ms. Soong Ching Ling organized the China Defense League in Hong Kong. Its main work was to support the War of Resistance, report the situation of the Chinese people's War of Resistance to the world, win the sympathy of international peace-loving and just people, and raise funds and materials to provide assistance to medicine, children's welfare, industrial cooperatives, etc., in order to support the War of Resistance. In particular, the funds and materials raised were vigorously sent to the Eighth Route Army and the liberated areas behind enemy lines.

At that time, medical work in the liberated areas was very difficult, and Western medicines and surgical equipment were very scarce. The "League" introduced medical cadres to go there, such as the Canadian Dr. Bethune and the Indian Dr. Kotnis. They dedicated their lives to the cause of liberation with internationalist spirit and selflessness. On the other hand, and more importantly, it supported the medical and material supplies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, tetanus serum, quinine, various vaccines, as well as various surgical equipment, laboratory equipment, a large number of stretchers, blankets, bedding, etc., to the liberated areas which were in dire need of medical treatment.

International Peace Hospitals were established in Yan'an, Wutai Mountain, Southeast Shanxi, and North and Central China in the liberated areas; and the New Fourth Army hospitals were supported. Dr. Bethune played a great role in the development of the International Peace Hospital by training medical cadres and establishing medical work systems in the liberated areas.

While carrying out medical work, attention was also paid to childcare, supporting several children's welfare homes in northern Shaanxi, as well as the Anti-Japanese University and the Lu Xun Academy of Arts.

The "League" supported the War of Resistance, advocated a united front, and advocated democracy in order to defeat Japanese imperialism. Transporting supplies to the liberated areas was not only subject to looting by enemy and puppet troops and obstruction by the Kuomintang, and even confiscation; it also had to go through tortuous and difficult transportation lines. But it always took manpower and financial resources, carefully planned cover, and continuously transported to the liberated areas. All of these involved political and concrete struggles against the enemy and the Kuomintang.

On December 8, 1941, the Pacific War broke out, and the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong. Ms. Soong Ching Ling left Hong Kong for Chongqing on the last plane. After Hong Kong was occupied by Japanese imperialism, some foreign staff members of the "League" were persecuted by the enemy.

(2) The period of the China Defense League in Chongqing from 1942 to 1945:

In the summer and autumn of 1942, with the support of friends of the "League" in China, it resumed its work.

The task of the "League" was the same as in the previous period, but the environment was even worse. The Kuomintang reactionaries' collusion to oppose the Communist Party and the people became more blatant, colluding with the enemy and puppet troops, blockading the liberated areas, and not allowing supplies to be transported. Later, they even openly robbed the supplies that the "League" transported to the liberated areas.

At the same time, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the international situation changed. It was more difficult for Chongqing to contact and work with foreign countries. At that time, foreign fund-raising organizations such as the United China Relief, the British United Aid to China Fund, etc., also had close relations with the Kuomintang. Therefore, on the one hand, the "League" had to do its best to raise funds and materials and try to transport them to the liberated areas. On the other hand, due to Ms. Soong Ching Ling's international status and the complete records of handling funds and materials, the "League" was able to state internationally the needs of the people who insisted on resisting Japan—the people and anti-Japanese army in the liberated areas—and refute the slanderous remarks of the domestic reactionaries. These reactionaries advocated that donations should not be transported to the liberated areas. The work was more arduous than in the previous period, and the struggle was more intense.

During this period, the "League" seized every opportunity to carry out its work. For example, it continued to transport various surgical equipment to the International Peace Hospital, supported the teaching work of Bethune Medical College with the books, materials and equipment it needed, and allocated funds to support the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's pharmaceutical factories (according to records, in 1942, donations from the "League" accounted for more than 12% of the total expenditure of the Eighth Route Army Pharmaceutical Factory).

For example, it also assisted 21 nurseries in the Border Region Government, the most famous of which was the Los Angeles Nursery. It also assisted schools for children of anti-Japanese soldiers, juvenile technical schools, etc. It also continued to help the Northwest Industrial Cooperative's Yan'an Office to support production for self-salvation.

In 1943, there was a major famine in Henan. Many people starved to death in the enemy-occupied areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and were also subjected to heavy conscription and taxation. The "League" raised a large amount of funds and materials in China and went to provide relief.

(3) The period of the China Welfare Fund in Shanghai before liberation from 1945 to 1949:

After the victory of the War of Resistance, in November 1945, Ms. Soong Ching Ling returned to Shanghai and announced the continuation of her work, changing the name of the China Defense League to the China Welfare Fund. At the same time, she announced that the China Welfare Fund would expand and develop its work, and devote itself to the restoration and construction work after the war wounds.

At that time, the work was to continue the work of the China Defense League, that is, to support the International Peace Hospitals, medical colleges, nurseries, orphanages, experimental farms, pharmaceutical factories and other undertakings in the border areas and liberated areas, and to plan to assist poor and sick writers in Shanghai, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu and other places.

At that time, eight International Peace Hospitals and forty-two branch hospitals, and eight medical colleges received assistance in medicines, equipment, and teaching materials. Ten nurseries and orphanages with 2,500 children received support. Experimental farms and pharmaceutical factories received agricultural tools, pharmaceutical raw materials, and technical support.

After 1946, children's work was developed in Shanghai. A children's reading room was established next to Jiaozhou Park, which was changed to the First Children's Welfare Station in the spring of 1947. In October 1947, the Second Welfare Station was established in Tongbei Park (now Hudong Labor Park), and the Third Station opened in Kunshan Park in November. At the same time, the children's theater troupe began to be founded in the Third Station. The children's welfare stations were located in factory slums, carrying out literacy education, medical and health care work, and hygiene education for the surrounding poor children.

The work of children's culture and health care in Shanghai, on the one hand, was to cover up the work of the China Welfare Fund to support the border areas and liberated areas; especially after American imperialism supported Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas, the political environment in Shanghai became more unfavorable to the China Welfare Fund. But on the other hand, the Shanghai work was also extremely meaningful. At that time, in the areas under Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, the people's lives were in dire straits, and a large number of children were starving, sick, and out of school. Through the work of welfare stations, etc., children were rescued, and certain revolutionary education was carried out for children through cultural and educational activities.

At that time, there was also a War Disaster Children's Adoption Association, which was a cooperation between the China Welfare Fund and foreign relief organizations, providing financial assistance to more than 30 institutions and supporting the lives and education of more than 5,000 children. These institutions and children were able to survive the extremely difficult period under the dark rule.

During the entire War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation after the establishment of the "League", while carrying out various support for the border areas, guerrilla areas behind enemy lines, liberated areas, and women and children's welfare work in Shanghai, it continuously reported the true situation of the Chinese people's arduous struggle for the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to foreign countries. This played an important role in smashing the imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek's rumors and slanders against the people, in establishing contact between the people in the border areas and liberated areas and progressive people abroad, and in winning the support of international friends for the Chinese people's struggle.

(4) The period of the China Welfare Institute in Shanghai from liberation in 1949 to the present:

Since the liberation of Shanghai, the work of the China Welfare Fund has entered a new period. In a brand-new era of the people, without oppression and persecution, the new environment has brought broad prospects for the China Welfare Fund to serve the people.

In 1949, on the one hand, it still helped the Temporary Relief Joint Association to carry out refugee relief and send refugees back to their hometowns; on the other hand, it studied new work guidelines and tasks. At this time, a nursery was opened (at No. 369 North Shaanxi Road, the predecessor of the current kindergarten), and the children's theater troupe was expanded. At that time, a large number of staff members participated in the People's Government and the Southbound Working Group, and therefore new staff members were absorbed.

In the spring of 1950, after a study, the work of the three children's welfare stations ended, and they were changed to the Children's Work Research Office (the predecessor of Children's Era Magazine), the Juvenile and Children's Library, the Juvenile and Children's Cultural Station, and the Maternal and Child Health Station. They started working one after another in the second quarter.

On August 15, Ms. Soong Ching Ling officially announced that the China Welfare Fund would be renamed the China Welfare Institute, and determined that the task of the China Welfare Institute was to engage in experimental and demonstrative work in women and children's health and culture, and to carry out international propaganda work on the new China.

Regarding the work of the International Peace Hospital in the old areas, etc., since the whole country was liberated, the various undertakings were directly led by the People's Government to carry out the work, and the task of support has been completed; the work of the adopted children of the original War Disaster Adoption Association also ended at the same time.

At the end of 1950, there were eight business units: Children's Theater Troupe, Children's Era Magazine, Juvenile and Children's Library, Juvenile and Children's Cultural Station, Maternal and Child Health Station, Nursery (now changed to Kindergarten), Infant Nursery (now changed to Nursery), and Huxi Female Workers' Maternal and Child Health Station.

In 1951, a new house was built at the original site of the Juvenile and Children's Cultural Station, expanding its scale and renaming it the Juvenile and Children's Cultural Palace, which initially had the prototype of a children's palace. It took over the three business units of the American Church World Service, and the nursery was merged into the China Welfare Institute Nursery, and the two welfare stations were changed to the reading rooms of the China Welfare Institute Juvenile and Children's Library.

In January 1952, "China Reconstructs" was founded and published; in mid-August, the two health stations were merged, and the International Peace Maternal and Child Health Hospital officially opened.

In the spring of 1953, the original Juvenile and Children's Cultural Palace and the library were merged to create the Children's Palace, which opened on June 1.

After 1954, with the development of national economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings, the quality of work of the various undertakings of the China Welfare Institute has been improved to varying degrees, and certain experience has been accumulated. The staff has also improved in terms of business level and politics. At the same time, the business of each unit has been expanded to varying degrees. For example, "China Reconstructs" was changed from a bimonthly magazine to a monthly magazine; the International Peace Maternal and Child Health Hospital moved to a new site, expanded its premises, and added beds; the Children's Theater Troupe has accumulated certain experience and trained cadres through continuous performances and adherence to training, and has the conditions for a theater. On April 10, 1957, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the troupe, the Children's Art Theater was officially established. In 1958, the Yan'an Cinema was rebuilt into the Children's Art Theater.

    中国福利会二十年
    1958年6月14日，是中国福利会的二十周年，中国福利会从1938年在香港成立保卫中国同盟开始，经过抗日战争时期、解放战争时期、和解放后到现在，二十年来，在它的创办人和领导人宋庆龄先生领导下，与中国人民的革命斗争紧紧联系在一起，为中国人民革命斗争和中国人民的社会主义建设事业，贡献了自己的力量。
    中国福利会二十年的历史，可以分为四个阶段：
    （一）1938年6月至1941年12月保卫中国同盟在香港的时期：
    1938年，日本帝国主义的侵略凶焰，在蒋介石军队迅速溃退后，疯狂向中南地区进攻，民族危机深重。
    宋庆龄先生为了争取民族独立，坚决支援抗战，在香港组织保卫中国同盟。它的主要工作是支援抗战，向全世界报道中国人民抗战的情况，争取国际爱好和平正义人士的同情，并筹募款物，进行对医药、儿童保育、工业合作社等援助，以支援抗战。尤其是将筹得的款物，大力送往八路军和敌后解放地区。
    当时，解放区医疗工作很困难，西药及手术设备很缺乏。“保盟”一方面介绍医务干部前去，如加拿大人白求恩大夫，印度人柯棣华大夫等。他们以国际主义精神，忘我地为解放事业献出了自己的生命。另一方面，也是主要的一种支援，就是医药物资的支援，将当时伤病员极需要的药物，如消炎剂、破伤风血清、奎宁、各种疫苗等，以及各种手术设备、化验设备，大批担架、毛毯、被服等，运往解放区。
    在解放区的延安、五台山、晋东南、及华北、华中等地，设立国际和平医院；并支援新四军医院。白求恩大夫在解放区训练医务干部，建立医务工作制度，对国际和平医院的发展有很大作用。
    在进行医药工作同时，也注意儿童的保育工作，支援陕北几个儿童保育院，也支援抗日大学和鲁迅艺术学院。
    “保盟”支援抗战，主张统一战线，主张民主，以战胜日本帝国主义。运送物资到解放区去，一方面要遭到敌伪抢劫和国民党的阻挠，甚至没收；另一方面要经过曲折困难的交通线。但总是花了人力财力，周密计划掩护，源源不断地运往解放区。这些都包含着要在政治上、具体工作上同敌人和国民党进行斗争。
    1941年12月8日，太平洋战争爆发，日军侵占香港，宋庆龄先生乘最后一架飞机离香港到重庆。香港为日本帝国主义占领后，“保盟”有一部分外国工作人员，受到敌人的迫害。
    （二）1942年至1945年保卫中国同盟在重庆时期：
    在1942年夏秋间，“保盟”在国内的友人支持下，重新投入工作。
  “保盟”的任务与前一时期相同，但环境更恶劣。国民党反动派反共反人民的勾当更加明目张胆，与敌伪勾结，封锁解放区，不让物资运送，后来甚至公开抢劫“保盟”运送到解放区的物资。
    同时太平洋战争爆发后，国际情况有变化，重庆和国外联系和进行工作较困难，当时外国捐募款物机关如美国援华救济会、英国援华会等，又与国民党关系密切。因此，“保盟”一方面要尽力争取募得款物，设法运往解放区，一方面“保盟”由于宋庆龄先生的国际地位，以及处理款物的完整记录，得在国际间陈述坚持抗战的人民——解放区人民和抗日军队的需要，并驳斥国内的反动派的毁谤言论。这些反动派是主张捐款不要运到解放区去的。工作比前一个时期更艰苦，斗争也更紧张。
    在这时期中，“保盟”抓紧一切机会进行工作。例如继续运送各种手术设备给国际和平医院，支援白求恩医学院教学工作所需要的书籍资料和设备，拨款支援八路军和新四军的制药厂（据资料记载，1942年八路军制药厂全年开支中，“保盟”捐款占12％以上）。
    又如援助边区政府的托儿所二十一处，其中著名的为洛杉矶托儿所。又援助抗属子弟学校、少年技术学校等。并继续帮助西北工合延安办事处，支持生产自救。
    1943年，河南大灾荒，在敌伪统治区和国民党统治区很多人饿死了，还遭到抽丁、捐税重重压迫。“保盟”在国内筹募了大批款物，前往救济。
    （三）1945年至1949年解放前中国福利基金会在上海的时期：
    抗战胜利后，1945年11月，宋庆龄先生回到上海后便宣布继续她的工作，将保卫中国同盟的名称改为中国福利基金会。同时，她宣布中国福利基金会将扩大和发展工作，致力战争创伤的恢复和建设工作。
    当时的工作，是继续保卫中国同盟的工作，就是支援边区和解放区的国际和平医院、医学院、托儿所、孤儿院、实验农场、制药厂等事业，并计划在上海、重庆、昆明、成都等地援助贫病作家。
    当时有八所国际和平医院和四十二所分院、八所医学院得到医药器材和教学材料的援助，有二千五百名儿童的十所托儿所和孤儿院得到支持，实验农场和制药厂得到了农具、制药原料和技术上的支援。
    1946年后，在上海开辟了儿童工作。在胶州公园旁设立儿童阅览室，1947年春改为第一儿童福利站。1947年10月在通北公园内（现在沪东劳动公园）设立第二福利站，11月在昆山公园的第三站开幕，同时儿童剧团在第三站内开始创立。儿童福利站设在工厂贫民区，对周围贫苦儿童进行识字教育、医药保健工作和卫生教育工作。
    在上海的儿童文化和保健卫生工作，一方面是掩护中国福利基金会支援边区和解放区的工作；特别在美帝国主义支持蒋介石向解放区进攻后，上海政治环境更加不利于中国福利基金会的时候。但另一方面，上海工作也极有意义，在当时蒋介石反动统治地区，人民生活陷于水深火热中，大批儿童饥饿疾病失学，通过福利站等工作，挽救儿童，并通过文化教育活动，给儿童进行一定的革命教育。
    当时还有个战灾儿童义养会，是由中国福利基金会与国外救济团体合作，在经济上帮助了三十多个机构，支持了五千多个儿童的生活和教育。使这些机构和孩子，在黑暗统治下度过了极度困难的时期。
    “保盟”成立以后的整个抗日战争和解放战争时期里，在进行各项支援边区、敌后游击区、解放区以及在上海进行妇女儿童福利工作的同时，不断地将中国人民在中国共产党领导下，进行抗日战争和解放争战的艰苦斗争的真实情况，向国外报道，这对粉碎帝国主义和蒋介石对人民的造谣诬蔑，对建立边区解放区人民与国外进步人士的联系，对争取国际朋友对中国人民的斗争的支持，都起了重要的作用。
    （四）1949年解放后至现在，中国福利会在上海的时期：
    从上海解放后开始，中国福利基金会的工作进入一个新的时期。在一个崭新的人民时代，没有压迫和迫害，新环境给中国福利基金会带来了为人民服务的广阔前途。
    1949年内，一方面仍旧帮助临时救济联合会进行难民救济和遣送难民还乡工作；一方面在研究新的工作方针和任务。这时开办了一所托儿所（在陕西北路三百六十九号，即现在幼儿园的前身），扩大了儿童剧团。当时有大批工作人员参加了人民政府和南下工作团，因之又吸收了新的工作人员。
    1950年春季，经过一次学习，三个儿童福利站工作结束了，改变为儿童工作研究室（即儿童时代社前身）、少年儿童图书馆、少年儿童文化站、妇幼保健站。在二季度内陆续开始工作。
    8月15日，宋庆龄先生正式宣布，将中国福利基金会改称为中国福利会，并确定中国福利会的任务是从事妇女儿童保健文化方面的实验性示范性工作，并进行关于新中国的国际宣传工作。
    关于老区国际和平医院等工作，由于全国解放了，各事业由人民政府直接领导进行工作，支援工作任务已完成；原来的战灾义养会的义养儿童的工作，也同时结束。
    1950年底，共有八个业务单位：儿童剧团、儿童时代社、少年儿童图书馆、少年儿童文化站、妇幼保健站、托儿所（现改为幼儿园）、婴儿托儿所（现改为托儿所）、沪西女工妇幼保健站。
    1951年内，在少年儿童文化站原址建筑了新屋，扩大规模，改称少年儿童文化馆，初步具备了少年宫的雏形。接办了美国教会世界服务会的三个业务单位，托儿所并入中国福利会托儿所，二个福利站改为中国福利会少年儿童图书馆阅览室。
    1952年1月，“中国建设”创刊出版；8月中，二个保健站合并，国际和平妇幼保健院正式开幕。
    1953年春，将原来少年儿童文化馆和图书馆合并，创立少年宫，于6月1日开幕。
    1954年后，随着国家经济建设和文教事业的发展，中国福利会各事业单位工作质量有不同程度的提高，积累了一定的经验，工作人员在业务水平和政治上都有所提高。同时，各单位的业务仍有不同程度的扩展，如：“中国建设”由双月刊改为月刊；国际和平妇幼保健院迁移新址，扩大院舍，增设了床位；儿童剧团几年来经过不断演出和坚持训练培养干部，积累了一定的经验和培养了干部，具备了剧院的条件，在1957年4月10日剧团成立十周年纪念时，正式成立儿童艺术剧院。并于1958年将延安电影院改建为儿童艺术剧场。（新华社）
