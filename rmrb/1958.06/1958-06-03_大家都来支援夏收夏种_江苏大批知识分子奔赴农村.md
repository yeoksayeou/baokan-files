Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 1st: A shock force of one million people in Jiangsu Province, composed of teachers and students, is rushing to the countryside to support the summer harvest and planting. Among them, Yancheng, Wujin, Yixing and other counties have mobilized more than 330,000 primary and secondary school teachers and students to join this battle.

During the labor, teachers and students showed great enthusiasm and high morale. The 1,200 teachers and students of Taixing County Middle School spent only half a day to cut, bundle, and stack all 145 mu of barley on the county farm. The 356 teachers and students of Zezhuang Middle School in Hai'an County helped Zezhuang Agricultural Cooperative with the summer harvest after an evening of self-study. Under the moonlight, they cut more than 100 mu of wheat in four hours. Teachers and students in Yancheng County, the earliest to take action in the province, have been participating in wheat harvesting, rice transplanting, and fertilizer accumulation since May 21, with an average of more than 76,000 people participating in labor every day, accumulating more than 700,000 workdays.

Students from secondary agricultural schools and privately run agricultural middle schools in various regions are the most active members of this million-strong shock force. One hundred percent of the students at Jurong Agricultural School have joined the battle. Xuzhou Agricultural School decided to transfer 600 teachers and students to support agricultural cooperatives in harvesting, including 200 people who went to Weishan Lake to carry out a five-day harvesting blitz. After receiving political and technical education on summer harvesting and planting, more than 2,000 students from agricultural middle schools in Songjiang County have all been released for a busy holiday to participate in labor. University students are also actively supporting the summer harvest and planting. More than 10,000 university students in the Nanjing area have joined the labor force. Fourth-year students majoring in agricultural machinery at Nanjing Institute of Technology drove combine harvesters, tractors, and other large agricultural machines to Baguazhou in the suburbs to participate in harvesting, threshing, and land cultivation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 2nd: The medical and health circles in Jiangsu Province have organized a large number of mobile medical teams to go deep into the countryside to carry out field labor protection and support the summer harvest and planting.

Hospitals, epidemic prevention stations, joint clinics, pharmacies, and other units in various counties in Jiangsu Province have taken action. Taicang County organized 112 mobile medical teams to ensure that every township has a clinic and medical station, and every cooperative has a mobile medical point. In order to facilitate the masses, the Liuhe Township Central Joint Clinic in the county not only set up five clinics but also established more than a dozen mobile medical points and five field mobile medical teams in the production teams of the agricultural cooperative. 138 medical personnel in Danyang County adopted the method of "setting up points in every cooperative, making rounds in every team, treating diseases when there are diseases, and participating in production when there are no diseases" to participate in busy season medical work. Employees of many pharmacies also actively cooperated with doctors to go to the fields, ensuring that medicines are delivered wherever there are patients.

These organized mobile medical teams supporting the summer harvest and planting include doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, internal medicine, surgery, midwives, and laboratory technicians. Many leading cadres of medical and health units also took the lead in going to the countryside. The mobile medical team organized by Lianshui County People's Hospital was led by the vice president of the hospital, who carried medical equipment and sufficient first-aid medicines to go deep into the countryside. The vice president personally went to the door to diagnose and treat patients with serious illnesses. This medical team treated 243 patients in three days.

These mobile medical teams conduct medical work while working in the countryside, and are warmly welcomed by the masses. Many commune members reflected that in the past, when they got sick during the busy farming season, they had to find a boat and someone to go to town to see a doctor, which cost labor and delayed production. Now, doctors come to the fields to support the summer harvest and planting, which is really a good doctor under the leadership of the Communist Party.
Title: Let the Film Industry Blossom Everywhere - Commentator of This Newspaper

Every province has a film studio, every county has a cinema, and every township has a projection team. This is an inspiring slogan, and also an ideal that the people of our country have looked forward to in the past. However, in today's situation of a great leap forward in the film industry, the ideal is becoming a reality, and more than 600 million people in our country, especially the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will be able to see movies more and faster from now on.

In the nine years since liberation, China's film industry has been established and developed from a backward foundation and has achieved great success. However, compared with the development of socialist economic construction, the number of films we have produced is not large enough, and the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers are not sufficiently reflected. Some films are still incomprehensible to workers and peasants. Despite the great efforts made by filmmakers, especially in recent years, there has been great progress in quantity and quality, but it is still far from meeting the needs of 600 million viewers. In order to improve and develop China's film industry, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, it is very timely and necessary to carry out "overall planning, change the system, decentralize power, and let local authorities take the lead in running the film industry." This new measure will be more conducive to the "more, faster, better, and more economical" development of China's film industry, and will also be more conducive to the film industry serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism.

The history of the film industry in our country is not long, but it is not something mysterious and unattainable. At present, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, as well as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other autonomous regions, have established film studios with the specific leadership of the Party committees and the help of fraternal factories, and have produced many newsreels, special news issues and other documentaries, with good results. This shows that as long as we fully rely on the Party committees, trust the masses, and mobilize all positive factors, film factories can be established and managed very well. The idea of blindly believing in experts and not believing in our own strength is unacceptable.

After the provinces have established film studios, they should adhere to the policy of film serving politics and serving socialism, and shoot more films reflecting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the early stage of construction, it should be advocated to mainly shoot news documentaries with local characteristics and reflecting the great leap forward of the people in this region. When conditions are ripe, we should strive to shoot feature films and other artistic films.

It can be said that the establishment of film factories in many provinces and regions is starting from scratch. Therefore, during the construction period, we should also pay attention to "more, faster, better, and more economical." All resources that can be utilized in the province, such as old warehouses, old factory buildings, and old machinery and equipment, should be fully utilized. We must resolutely oppose all ideas of seeking newness, seeking largeness, and seeking completeness.

The establishment of local film studios marks that China's film industry has entered a new era. In the future, under the unified leadership and overall planning of the Ministry of Culture, China's film industry will inevitably strengthen the publicity of the general line of socialist construction, more comprehensively and rapidly reflect the face of our times and boost the enthusiasm of the people across the country, and continuously create new socialist films with national characteristics that are loved by 600 million viewers.

　　大家都来支援夏收夏种
    江苏大批知识分子奔赴农村
    新华社南京1日电  江苏省由教师学生组成的一支拥有百万人的突击队，正浩浩荡荡地奔赴农村支援夏收夏种。其中盐城、武进、宜兴等县，投入这一战斗的中小学师生即有三十三万多人。
    在劳动中，师生干劲大，热情高。泰兴县中学师生一千二百人，只花了半天时间，就将县农场的一百四十五亩大麦全部割好、捆好、堆好。海安县迮庄中学师生三百五十六人，一个晚上自修后，在月光下帮助迮庄农业社夏收，四小时中共割了一百多亩麦子。全省行动最早的盐城县的教师学生，从5月21日开始，平均每天有七万六千多人参加割麦、栽秧、积肥等劳动。已做了七十多万个劳动日。
    各地中等农业学校与民办农业中学的学生，是这支百万人突击队中最活跃的成员。句容农业学校的学生，百分之百投入战斗。徐州农业学校决定抽调师生六百人支援农业社收割，其中有二百人远征微山湖，突击收割五天。松江县各乡农业中学，二千多学生受了夏收夏种的政治和技术教育后，已全部放忙假投入劳动。高等学校的学生也同样积极支援夏收夏种。南京地区的高等学校投入劳动的学生已超过一万人。南京工学院农业机械专业四年级学生驾驶了联合收割机、拖拉机等大型农业机器，前往市郊八卦洲参加收割、脱粒与耕地工作。
    新华社南京2日电  江苏省医药卫生界组织大批巡回医疗小组，深入农村开展田间劳动保护，支援夏收夏种。
    江苏省各县的医院、卫生防疫站、联合诊所、药店等都已行动起来。太仓县组织了一百一十二个巡回医疗组，做到乡乡有诊所和医疗站，社社有巡回医疗点。该县浏河乡中心联合诊所为便利群众，除分设五个诊疗所外，还在农业社的生产队设立了十几个巡回医疗点，五个田间流动医疗组。丹阳县一百三十八名医务人员采取“社社设点、队队巡回，有病治病、无病参加生产”的办法参加农忙医疗工作。很多药店的职工也都积极配合医生一起下田，做到哪里有病人，药品就送到哪里。
    这些组织起来支援夏收夏种的巡回医疗小组中，有中医、西医、内科、外科，还有助产士、化验员等。很多医疗卫生单位的领导干部也都是亲自带头下乡。涟水县人民医院组织的巡回医疗组，由该院副院长率领，携带了医疗器械与足够的急救药品深入农村，重病人都由副院长亲自上门诊疗。这个医疗组在三天中就为二百四十三个病人看了病。
    这些巡回医疗小组在农村一面劳动，一面开展医疗工作，受到了广大群众热烈的欢迎。许多社员反映说：过去农忙时生病，要弄船找人上镇去看，既花费劳力，又耽误生产；现在医生到田头来支援夏收夏种，真是共产党领导的好医生。祝电影事业遍地开花本报评论员
    省省都有电影制片厂，县县都有电影院，乡乡都有放映队这是一个振奋人心的口号，也是我国人民过去所企望着的一个理想，然而在今天电影事业大跃进的形势下，理想正变为事实，我国六亿多人民首先是广大工农群众从此可以更多更快地看到电影了。
    解放九年来，我国电影从一个落后的基础上建立发展起来，已经获得很大成绩，但是同社会主义经济建设的发展相比，我们拍制的影片的数量还不多，反映工农兵生活不够，有的影片工农群众还看不懂。尽管电影工作者作了很大的努力，特别是近年来在数量和质量上都有大的进展，但是总还远远不能满足六亿观众的要求。为了改进和发展我国电影事业，在社会主义建设总路线光辉的照耀下，进行“全面规划、改变体制、下放权限，以地方为主来办电影事业”是非常适时和必要的。这项新的措施，能够更有利于我国电影事业“多、快、好、省”地发展，也能够更有利于电影事业为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务。
    电影事业在我国的历史不长，但它也并不是什么神秘和高不可攀的事情，目前浙江、安徽、江苏等省和内蒙、新疆等自治区，在党委具体领导和兄弟厂的帮助下，已经运用了本地区的力量建立了制片厂，并已拍出了许多新闻简报、新闻专号等纪录片，成绩很好。这就说明只要充分依靠党委，相信群众，调动一切积极因素，电影厂是完全可以办起来而且办得很好的。那种迷信专家、不相信自己力量的思想，是要不得的。
    各省建立了制片厂以后，应该坚持电影为政治服务、为社会主义服务的方针，多拍反映工农兵生活题材的影片。在初建时期，应该提倡以拍富有地方特色，反映本地区人民大跃进的新闻纪录片为主，等条件具备，再争取拍故事片及其他艺术片。
    在许多省区办电影厂，可以说都是平地起家的。因此，在建厂期间，也要注意到“多、快、好、省”，本省一切可以利用的资源，如旧仓库、旧厂房、旧机器设备等，都应该充分地利用起来，坚决反对一切求新求大求全的思想。
    地方办电影制片厂，标帜着我国电影事业进入一个崭新的时期，今后，我国电影事业在文化部统一领导和全面规划下必然会加强对社会主义建设总路线的宣传，更全面、迅速地反映我们时代的面貌和鼓足全国人民的干劲，并不断地创造出社会主义的、具有民族风格的、为六亿观众所喜爱的新电影。
