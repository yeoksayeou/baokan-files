    Talking About Habits
    Ding Shan

    Habits are produced under certain social and natural conditions. Taking the influence of natural conditions as an example, different geographical and climatic conditions will lead to different farming systems and methods. For example, in northern and southern China, in mountainous areas and plains, there are sets of farming methods and systems tailored to local conditions. However, some "condition theorists" exaggerate the influence of this aspect, believing that natural conditions are the only factor determining farming habits, and since natural conditions have not changed, farming habits cannot be changed either. "Habit theorists" also conclude from this: generations have farmed according to this habit, so of course it cannot be changed.

    Some people emphasize the characteristics of Heilongjiang: abundant land, sparse population, and a short frost-free period, believing that intensive cultivation is impossible. They also emphasize farming habits such as "one application of fertilizer every three years" and "a quick weeding three times is enough to eat," believing that it has always been the case, and there is no need to apply more fertilizer or weed more often.

    In fact, natural conditions have only a certain influence on the formation of farming habits, and the decisive factor is the level of development of the productive forces. Productive forces are the most active and revolutionary; they are constantly developing, and therefore there are different levels of development in different historical periods, which will correspondingly produce different farming habits. Still taking Heilongjiang as an example, not to mention hundreds of years ago, even a few decades ago, were their farming habits exactly the same as they are now? Was it also the habit of "one application of fertilizer every three years" or "a quick weeding three times is enough to eat"? No, the farming methods at that time were even more extensive. In different historical periods, it would be "one application of fertilizer every five years," "one application of fertilizer every ten years," and in earlier periods, it was even "no fertilizer at all." Habits have always been developing and changing, but in the old society, because the productive forces were subject to various obstacles and constraints, their changes were very small. Today, the natural conditions in Heilongjiang have not changed much, but all the large fields have been weeded three times, and one-quarter of the land has begun to be weeded a fourth time. This fact shows that after the realization of the collective ownership economy, after the great ideological liberation of the nationwide rectification campaign, and under the encouragement of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the productive forces have already had and will have even greater development, and farming systems and methods will inevitably change accordingly.

    "Condition theorists" and "habit theorists" always look at problems with a fixed and unchanging perspective, and always like to do things according to old habits. They dare not break with convention, and therefore are shackled by "habits."

    Marxism teaches us to look at problems from a developmental point of view. Everything is changing with the change of conditions, and all habits, including farming habits, are also changing with the change of conditions.

    谈习惯
    丁山
    习惯是在一定社会条件和自然条件下产生的。以自然条件的影响为例，在不同的地理和气候条件下，会有不同的耕作制度和耕作方法。例如，在我国的北方和南方，在山区和平原，就各有一套因地制宜的耕作方法和耕作制度。可是，有些“条件论”者，夸大了这一方面的影响，认为自然条件是决定耕作习惯的唯一因素，自然条件既然没有改变，耕作习惯也就不能改变。“习惯论”者也由此得出结论：祖祖辈辈都是按照这种习惯耕作的，当然无法改变。
    有些人就是强调了黑龙江地多、人少、无霜期短的特点，认为无法精耕细作；他们还强调了“三年一槎粪”“毛撸三遍吃饱饭”等耕作习惯，认为历来都是如此，无需多施肥，多锄草了。
    其实，自然条件对耕作习惯的形成仅仅只有一定的影响，决定性的条件却是生产力的发展水平。生产力是最活跃、最革命的，它总是不停地在发展着，因此在不同的历史时期有不同的发展水平，也就会相应地产生不同的耕作习惯。仍然以黑龙江为例，不用说在几百年以前，就是几十年以前，他们的耕作习惯是不是和现在一模一样呢？是不是也是“三年一槎粪”或“毛撸三遍吃饱饭”的习惯呢？不是的，那时的耕作方法更加粗放。在不同的历史时期会是“五年一槎粪”，“十年一槎粪”，在更早的时期甚至是“根本不上粪”。习惯从来就是发展和变化的，不过在旧社会的时候，由于生产力受到了种种的阻碍和束缚，它的变化很小罢了。如今，黑龙江的自然条件并没有什么大改变，但是全部大田已经锄完了三遍，四分之一的地又开始锄四遍了。这个事实说明，在实现了集体所有制的经济以后，在经过全民整风运动思想大解放以后，在多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线鼓舞下，生产力已经有了并且还会有更巨大的发展，耕作制度和耕作方法也必然随着有所改变。
    “条件论”和“习惯论”者总是用固定不变的眼光看问题，总是喜欢按照老习惯办事，他们不敢打破常规，因而被“习惯”束缚着了手脚。
    马克思主义教导我们，要从发展的观点看问题。一切事情都是随着条件的变化在变化，一切的习惯，包括耕作习惯在内，也是随着条件的变化在变化。
