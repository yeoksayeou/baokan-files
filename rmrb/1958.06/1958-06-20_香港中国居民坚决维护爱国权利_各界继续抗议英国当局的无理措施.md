    More than 1,000 workers in the Hong Kong textile dyeing industry held a gathering on the evening of the 16th to condemn the Hong Kong Director of Education's interference with Chinese residents' hanging of the Chinese national flag. Many female workers from yarn factories, who braved the rain to attend the meeting from the suburbs, eagerly went on stage to speak. They expressed their firm support for the protest lodged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the British authorities, thanked the people of the motherland for their concern for the interests of Hong Kong compatriots, and expressed their determination to safeguard their patriotic rights, demanding that the Hong Kong authorities immediately cease their provocative actions against Chinese residents. On the 15th, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions convened a full council meeting on the incident of the Hong Kong authorities interfering with the patriotic rights of Hong Kong Chinese residents. Representatives of various trade unions reported the enthusiastic mood of workers in various industries in Hong Kong in supporting the note of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To date, workers belonging to 52 trade unions have held gatherings to protest the Hong Kong authorities' unreasonable measures, believing that the statement made by the Hong Kong authorities' spokesperson on this incident, which distorts the facts, only further increases the anger of Hong Kong workers.
