    The story of Liu Hulan's glorious sacrifice is almost universally known throughout the country. The performance of the new opera "Liu Hulan" was welcomed by the broad masses, who received profound education from it.

    The members of the Henan Yuju Opera Troupe No. 3 are mostly from cultural work troupes. In order to inherit and develop the tradition of opera, they devoted themselves to learning Yuju opera. The "Liu Hulan" performed by the troupe shows that these young actors have not only mastered the essence of this local opera genre well, but also made some innovations. The Yuju opera "Liu Hulan" is a modern opera with vivid educational significance.
