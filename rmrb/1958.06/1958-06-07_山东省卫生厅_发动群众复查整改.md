    Shandong Provincial Health Department
    Mobilizes the Masses to Review and Rectify
    (Our dispatch) According to the Dazhong Daily news: The Shandong Provincial Health Department's Rectification Leadership Group has currently mobilized all cadres to conduct a major review of the rectification process, and requires rectification to be carried out alongside the review, to ensure the quality of the rectification and to achieve thorough and in-depth change, while also preparing for the transition to the fourth stage of the rectification campaign.
    During the "Double-Anti" campaign's airing of views and debates, cadres of the Health Department and its affiliated units posted nearly 200,000 big-character posters, exposing a large number of problems in their work. Subsequently, a mass-based major rectification and change was carried out, with over 90% of the items that needed to be changed in each unit being quickly changed. However, the leadership initially had no idea about the quality of the rectification. After spot checks, it was discovered that while the units had generally rectified well, there were still many problems. This was prominently manifested in the fact that some problems appeared to be rectified on the surface but were not actually rectified; some problems were rectified from the perspective of one unit, but when brought up with the relevant units, those units did not rectify them; some problems were initially rectified, but not fundamentally; and, more importantly, some rectifications only remained on the planning stage, lacking practical action.
    The Health Department put forward the purpose and requirements of this major review of rectification: (1) To discover problems that have not been rectified or have not been rectified thoroughly through the review of rectification, and to rectify them alongside the review, supplementing what is lacking. (2) To commend units and individuals who have rectified well through the review, to boost their drive, and to prepare for the transition to the fourth stage of the rectification campaign. (3) Through this review, to lay the foundation for long-term implementation of the spirit of rectification and regular inspections and evaluations in the future.
    Currently, this major review of rectification by the Health Department has been fully launched. The masses in each unit have launched discussions and airing of views and debates, from opinions on the leadership's rectification to issues of individual ideology and work style. There are commendations, criticisms, and suggestions.

    山东省卫生厅
    发动群众复查整改
    本报讯　据大众日报消息：山东省卫生厅整风领导小组目前已发动全体干部，对整改进行一次大复查，并要求随复查随整改，以确保整改质量，做到改深改透，同时为转入整风第四阶段做好准备。
    该厅和所属单位干部在双反鸣放中，贴出了近二十万张大字报，揭发出了工作中大量的问题，随即又进行了群众性的大整大改，各个单位凡是应改的，迅速地改到了90％以上。但是，整改质量如何，开始领导上心中无数。在抽查之后，始发现各单位基本上改得好，但还存在着不少问题。突出地表现在有些问题从表面看是改了，而实际上并没有改；有些问题在这个单位来看是改了，但是提到有关单位之后，有关单位并没有改；还有些问题，做了初步地改，而没有从根本上改；更重要地是有些整改只停留在规划上，缺乏实际行动。
    该厅提出这次整改大复查的目的与要求是：（一）通过整改复查发现没有整改或整改不彻底的问题，并随复查随整改，缺什么补什么。（二）通过复查表扬整改好的单位和个人，鼓足干劲，并为转入整风第四阶段做好准备。（三）通过这次复查，为今后长期贯彻整风精神，经常检查评比打下基础。
    目前该厅的这种整改大复查已全面展开。各单位的群众从对领导上整改的意见到个人的思想作风上的问题，都已展开了讨论、鸣放，其中有表扬、有批评、有建议。
