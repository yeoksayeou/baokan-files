Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th Dispatch from TASS: Former U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson stated on the 8th at the University of Michigan during a foreign policy speech that the Western world is currently facing “unprecedented political fragility and crisis.” In this regard, he cited signs such as: “the weakening of our alliance, Russia’s great achievements, the increasingly chaotic economy [of Western countries], the nationalist revolution sweeping the world, and the increasingly widespread unfriendliness and distrust towards the United States.”

Referring to the global economic situation, Stevenson said: "I believe that a new crisis is threatening us (i.e., the capitalist world) today." Just as the recession is affecting the United States, "the Russians are striding forward. They propose expanding trade with Europe. They attract surrounding countries with long-term loans at low interest rates. In addition, the production of Russia and China is expanding. The possibility of them taking out more capital and more goods for exchange is increasing year by year."

Stevenson suggested that the U.S. authorities show "bolder political and economic initiative" and "long-term efforts in defense."

Stevenson advocated for "taking a small step towards disarmament," after which "a second step can be stipulated, and then a third step, while trust will naturally grow." He advocated concluding an agreement to stop testing nuclear weapons as the first step, and pointed out: "Russia has shown this initiative."

Stevenson believes that the strength of "Soviet power" should be acknowledged. He said that the current policy of the United States "does not seem to have achieved any effective results." "The complacent idea that we (the United States) are not afraid of retaliation and they (the Soviet Union) are afraid of retaliation has been completely shattered by the launch of satellites."

    史蒂文森承认
    西方陷于政治和经济危机
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社纽约9日讯：美国前民主党总统候选人史蒂文森8日在密执安大学发表外交政策演说时说，目前西方世界存在着“史无前例的政治脆弱和危机”。在这方面他说到的一些迹象是：“我们联盟的削弱、俄国的伟大成就、（西方国家）日益混乱的经济、席卷全世界的民族主义革命以及对美国越来越广泛的不友好和不信任”。
    史蒂文森在谈到世界经济状况时说：“我认为，今天一种新的危机在威胁着我们（即资本主义世界）。”正当衰退影响美国的时候，
  “俄国人在大踏步前进。他们建议同欧洲扩大贸易。他们以利息很低的长期贷款吸引周围的国家。此外，俄国和中国的生产在扩大。它们拿出更多的资本和更多的商品去进行交换的可能性一年比一年增加。”
    史蒂文森建议美国当局表现“更大胆的政治和经济的主动性”和“在国防方面作长期的努力”。
    史蒂文森主张“向裁军方面迈进一小步”，在这一步以后“可以规定第二步，以后第三步，同时信任也就会自然增长”。他主张把缔结停止试验核武器的协定作为第一步，并且指出：“俄国表现了这种主动”。
    史蒂文森认为应当承认“苏联实力”的强大。他说，美国现在的政策“看来没有得到丝毫有效的成果”。“那种认为我们（美国）不怕回击而他们（苏联）害怕回击的自满的观念已经由于卫星的发射而彻底破灭了”。
