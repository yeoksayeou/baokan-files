Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 17th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers are assisting the Korean people in production and construction with soaring enthusiasm. From January to the present, they have accumulated over 1,030,000 workdays participating in friendship labor.

    During this period, the Volunteer Army units have collectively constructed 819 water conservancy projects of various sizes, including reservoirs, dikes, and pools; planted over 4.4 million trees; sowed and transplanted seedlings on more than 28,000 mu; accumulated and transported over 37 million jin of fertilizer; reclaimed over 490 mu of wasteland; leveled over 6,300 mu of land; built a total of over 84,000 meters of roads; constructed 51 bridges; built over 30,000 square meters of houses; and transported over 16 million jin of materials.

    In their labor, Volunteer Army officers and soldiers displayed soaring enthusiasm for "Troops withdrawing, friendship enduring." Volunteer Army leaders General Yang Yong, General Wang Ping, and Lieutenant General Liang Biye, among others, participated in tree planting and the construction of the People's Committee office building in a certain county. Soldiers participating in the construction of the Dingzhou Reservoir braved the sub-zero temperatures at the start of the project, standing in 50-centimeter-deep icy water to dig the dam foundation. Some soldiers wore out their shoulders carrying earth, yet persisted in their labor. Many officers and soldiers participating in the construction of the Gusan Reservoir often arrived at the construction site before dawn to dig and carry earth. Soldier Cao Xianbi injured his leg at the Shizidong dam construction site but insisted on working. He said, "Before returning home, there won't be many more opportunities to work for the Korean people. If I can't run while working (carrying earth and stone), I'll stand and do it (digging earth, ramming)." To support Korean farmers in completing the spring sowing and summer harvesting plans ahead of schedule, the soldiers of the 5th Squad of a certain tank repair company worked hard for seventeen days and nights, imitating and manufacturing two corn planters, and producing and distributing 2,300 screws and nuts to local farms.

    In the friendship labor, the Volunteer Army units received great care and support from the Korean government and people. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Korean Cabinet and the People's Governments of North Pyongan Province and Dingzhou County sent the troops constructing the Dingzhou Reservoir a large number of work clothes, long water boots, eggs, vegetables, apples, fattened pigs, ginseng wine, and dried fish oil, and dispatched art troupes and film projection teams to provide over 200 performances for the troops. Korean Deputy Prime Ministers Hong Myong-hui and Li Zhouyuan also personally visited the construction site of the Gusan Reservoir to express their regards to the construction troops. Many elderly people boiled tea and delivered water to the troops, and even the "Young Pioneers" gathered wild vegetables to send to the Volunteer Army. This care and support brought great encouragement to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army.

    帮助朝鲜人民生产建设
    志愿军干劲冲天参加友谊劳动
    据新华社平壤17日电　中国人民志愿军广大官兵以冲天干劲协助朝鲜人民进行生产建设。从1月到目前为止，他们参加友谊劳动的劳动日已达一百零三万多个。
    在这段时间里，志愿军各部队共计修筑水库、堤坝、水池等大小水利工程八百一十九项，植树四百四十多万棵，播种插秧二万八千多亩，积肥送粪三千七百多万斤，开荒四百九十多亩，整理土地六千三百多亩，修筑公路共长八万四千多公尺，修桥五十一座，修盖房屋三万多平方公尺，运送物资一千六百多万斤。
    在劳动中，志愿军官兵为“军队撤出、友谊长存”发挥了冲天的干劲。志愿军首长杨勇上将、王平上将、梁必业中将等，都分别参加了植树和修建某地郡人民委员会办公大楼的劳动。参加修建定州水库的战士们，在工程开始时冒着零下十几度的严寒，站在五十公分深的冰水里挖坝基。有些战士抬土磨破了肩膀，仍坚持劳动。修建谷山水库的许多官兵时常在拂晓赶到工地，挖土抬土。战士曹鲜碧在狮子洞拦水坝工地把腿碰伤了，仍然坚持出工，他说：“回国前，为朝鲜人民劳动的机会不多了，我不能跑着干（运土石），就站着干（挖土、打夯）。”为了支援朝鲜农民提前完成春播夏收计划，某坦克修理连五班的战士们苦战十七昼夜，仿造了两台玉米播种机，制配了两千三百个螺丝钉、螺丝帽送给当地农场。
    志愿军各部队在友谊劳动中，得到了朝鲜政府和人民极大的关怀和支援。朝鲜内阁农业省和平安北道、定州郡政府，送给修建定州水库部队大批工作服、长统水靴、鸡蛋、蔬菜、苹果、肥猪、人参酒和鱼干油等礼品，并派艺术团和电影队给部队进行了二百多场慰问演出。朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹和李周渊还亲临谷山水库工地慰问施工部队。许多老人为部队烧茶送水，连“红领巾”也拣野菜送给志愿军。这些关怀和支援，给志愿军官兵带来极大的鼓舞。
