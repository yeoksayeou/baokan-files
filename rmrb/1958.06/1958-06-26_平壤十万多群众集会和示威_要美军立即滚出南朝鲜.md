Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: More than 100,000 people in Pyongyang held a rally and demonstration in Kim Il-sung Square this afternoon, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

Today is the Korean people's "Anti-American Struggle Day." Eight years ago today, US imperialism launched the Korean War.

The mass rally began at 6:00 PM. Kim Il, Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, and leaders of the Party, government, and Fatherland Front participated in the rally.

Park Kum-chol, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, spoke at the rally. He said that although the second group of the Chinese People's Volunteers is about to withdraw from Korea, the US military has so far refused to withdraw from South Korea, thus hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. Park Kum-chol then sternly denounced the various crimes of the US military in undermining the armistice agreement and creating various provocations to intensify the tense situation in Korea and the Far East. He pointed out that the US military's occupation of South Korea is the root of all the misfortunes of the South Korean people. The entire Korean people hate the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique. The United States has no further excuse to continue its occupation of South Korea. The Korean people will never allow their country to be divided forever. The people of North and South Korea will surely drive out the US imperialists and realize the peaceful reunification of Korea. Park Kum-chol finally joined the 100,000 people participating in the rally in chanting the slogan "US Aggressor Troops Get Out of Korea Immediately!"

Representatives of workers, peasants, students, and cultural figures from Pyongyang spoke at the rally. They unanimously condemned the crimes of US imperialism in invading Korea and obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and unanimously demanded that the US military immediately get out of the Korean land. They also expressed their determination to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland with practical actions.

After the rally, 100,000 people held a demonstration. At the front of the line, railway workers carried a huge banner that read "US Aggressor Troops Get Out of Korea Immediately." The demonstrators also carried huge banners with slogans such as "Long Live the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland," "Korea Belongs to the Korean People, US Troops Get Out," and "Glory Belongs to the Chinese People's Volunteers." The huge caricatures held high by the masses depicted the various crimes of US imperialists in invading Korea and implementing war policies. The angry cry of "US Troops Get Out" emanating from the crowd shook the entire city of Pyongyang. The demonstration ended at 7:30 PM. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Korea and the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers headed by Major General Xiao Yingtang participated in today's meeting.

    平壤十万多群众集会和示威
    要美军立即滚出南朝鲜
    据新华社平壤25日电　平壤市十万多群众今天下午在金日成广场举行集会和示威游行，要求美军立即从南朝鲜撤退。
    今天是朝鲜人民“反美斗争日”。八年前的今天，美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争。
    群众大会在下午六时开始，朝鲜内阁副首相金一等党、政府和祖国战线的领导人参加了大会。
    祖国战线中央委员会常务委员朴金哲在大会上讲话。他说，虽然中国人民志愿军的第二批部队即将撤出朝鲜，但是美军却至今拒绝从南朝鲜撤退，因而阻挠了朝鲜的和平统一。朴金哲接着严正地指责了美军破坏停战协定，制造各种挑衅来加剧朝鲜和远东的紧张局势的各种罪行。他指出，美军对南朝鲜的强占是南朝鲜人民一切不幸的根源。全体朝鲜人民都痛恨美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国集团。美国再没有任何借口继续强占南朝鲜。朝鲜人民决不能容许自己的祖国永远分裂下去，南北朝鲜人民必将把美帝国主义赶出去，实现朝鲜的和平统一。朴金哲最后和参加大会的十万群众一起高呼“美国侵略军立即滚出朝鲜！”的口号。
    平壤市的工人、农民、学生和文化界人士的代表都在大会上讲了话。他们一致谴责美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪行，一致要求美军立即从朝鲜的土地上滚出去。他们并表示要用实际行动促进祖国的和平统一。
    大会结束后，十万名群众举行了示威游行。在行列的最前面，铁道工人们抬着“美国侵略军立即从朝鲜的土地上滚出去”的巨幅标语。游行群众还抬着写着“祖国和平统一万岁”、“朝鲜是朝鲜人民自己的，美军滚出去”、“光荣属于中国人民志愿军”等口号的巨幅标语。群众高举着的巨幅漫画上，描画着美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜、实行战争政策等种种罪行。从群众中发出的“美军滚出去”的愤怒呼声，震撼着平壤全城。游行到下午七时半结束。参加今天大会的有各国驻朝使节和以萧应棠少将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团。
