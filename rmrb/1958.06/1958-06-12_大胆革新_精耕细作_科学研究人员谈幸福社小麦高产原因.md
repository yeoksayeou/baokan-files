Bold Innovation, Meticulous Cultivation
Scientific Researchers Discuss the Reasons for High Wheat Yields at the Happiness Cooperative

(Our Correspondent Tian Zhuang) This reporter interviewed Zhang Wenchang, an assistant researcher at the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, who personally participated in the wheat acceptance work at the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in Guanghua County, Hubei Province. Zhang spoke freely about the cooperative’s glorious achievement of an average yield of 3,215 jin per mu across eleven mu of wheat.

From June 7th to 9th, Zhang Wenchang participated in the acceptance work at the Happiness Cooperative, which set the highest record for wheat yield per unit area. During these days, in addition to generally measuring the land and verifying the area, he focused on understanding the cultivation process of the eleven mu of wheat, especially conducting investigations into the soil, roots, ears of wheat, and grains. After preliminary observation and analysis, Zhang Wenchang believes that this is not just a matter of yield; it demonstrates the infinite creativity of farmers under the leadership of the Party, and is particularly worthy of study by scientific workers.

How did this cooperative achieve this? According to this scientific researcher's preliminary analysis, the reasons are multifaceted, but fertile soil is a very important factor. This wheat was planted on a newly silted alluvial layer in the Han River. This type of soil has a high fertilizer content, and because it has been accumulating year by year, each layer is fertile, and various fertilizers, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are uniformly and rationally distributed. Preliminary analysis shows that this soil is not only highly effective but also has a good granular structure. The soil is loose yet firm, and microorganisms are very active in the soil layer, which is particularly suitable for the growth and development of crops. According to the inspection of some wheat stubble, the roots of this wheat generally developed very strongly, and were largely distributed in the soil layer about seven inches deep, in an umbrella shape. In places seven inches to one foot above the ground, there were also many root distributions, some reaching more than five feet deep. Precisely because the wheat roots are deep and wide, the area for wheat to absorb nutrients is large, which greatly benefits the growth of the crops. The result of this is many effective ears and large grains.

However, Zhang Wenchang believes that although good soil conditions and many effective ears of wheat are important factors in the cooperative achieving high yields, in the past, that is, in 1957, the yield of the same land was not high, averaging only more than 500 jin per mu. What is the reason for this? He said that this is mainly due to the farmers' bold innovations in agricultural production. The land was plowed three times and harrowed three times, with a plowing depth of about six inches. At the same time, because this is an alluvial layer, the general ground temperature is low. Therefore, when winter sowing last year, they also changed their late sowing habits, starting twenty-one days earlier than the previous year. Moreover, according to the characteristics of the fertile soil, they boldly increased the sowing amount from eighteen jin to thirty-two jin. All seeds were selected with mud water and mixed with cyanamide. In terms of sowing methods, they adopted a direct and horizontal cross-sowing method according to local conditions, thus achieving uniform and dense planting. All of this demonstrates the new style of the masses in daring to innovate.

Zhang Wenchang believes that the reason why the Happiness Cooperative was able to create the highest wheat yield record still needs further analysis and research by scientists. However, the facts have already proven that wheat is not a low-yield crop but has great potential. He said that, from this point of view, the educational significance for agricultural scientific workers is great, because in the past, in their view, high wheat yields were impossible, but now this view is untenable. At the same time, and more importantly, it also points out the direction for agricultural scientific research: it must be closely linked to reality, go to the masses of farmers, and learn from the masses of farmers. Only in this way can we better serve the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    大胆革新　精耕细作
    科学研究人员谈幸福社小麦高产原因
    本报讯　记者田庄报道：曾经亲自参加湖北省光化县幸福农业社小麦验收工作的科学研究人员张文畅，应记者的要求，畅谈了这个社十一亩小麦平均亩产三千二百一十五斤的辉煌成就。
    张文畅是华中农业科学研究所助理研究员。从6月7日到9日，他参加了创造小麦单位面积产量最高纪录的幸福社的验收工作。在这些日子里，他除了一般地进行了土地测量，核实了面积以外，着重地了解了这个社十一亩小麦的耕作栽培经过，特别是进行了有关这块土地的土壤以及根部、麦穗、籽粒等方面的调查工作。经过初步观察、分析以后，张文畅认为这不仅是产量问题，它说明了农民在党的领导下的创造力是无穷的，特别值得科学工作者学习。
    这个社是怎样创造出来的呢？根据这位科学研究人员初步的研究分析，认为，原因是多方面的，但是土壤肥沃是其中很重要的因素。这块小麦是种在汉水中新淤积起来的冲积层上的。这种土质含肥量很大，又由于是逐年淤积起来的，因此层层有肥，而且各种各样的肥料例如氮、磷、钾等都配合得均匀、合理。初步分析的结果，这种土壤不仅肥效高，而且团粒结构很好，土质松而又实，同时土层里微生物也很活跃，特别宜于农作物的生长发育。根据部分麦蔸的检查，这块小麦的根须一般发育很健壮，大量分布在土层七寸左右，呈伞状，离地面七寸到一尺多的地方，根须分布也很多，有的竟达到五尺多深。正是由于麦根扎得深，扎得广，小麦吸收养分的面积就大，大大有利于作物的成长。这样的结果是有效穗多，籽粒大。
    但是，张文畅认为，尽管土壤条件好，有效麦穗多，是这个社获得高产的重要因素，然而在这以前，也就是在1957年，同是这块土地的产量却不高，平均每亩只有五百多斤，这是什么原因呢？他说，这主要是因为农民群众在农业生产方面大胆革新的结果。这块地一共犁过三次，耙过三次，耕深达六寸左右，同时，由于这里是冲积层，一般地温较低，因此，去年冬播时，他们又改变了迟播习惯，比前一年提早了二十一天。而且，根据土壤肥沃的特点，他们大胆地把下种量从十八斤增加到三十二斤，全部经过泥水选种，并用赛力散药剂拌过，在播种方法上，他们因地制宜地采取了直横交叉撒播的方法，因而做到了匀播密植。所有这些都表现了群众勇于革新的新风格。
    张文畅认为幸福社之所以能够创造小麦最高产量纪录，还有待于科学家进一步分析、研究。不过，事实却已经证明了小麦不是低产作物，而是大有搞头。他说，从这一点来说，对农业科学工作者的教育意义是很大的，因为过去在他们看来，小麦高产是办不到的事，而现在这种看法站不住脚了。同时，更重要的，还为农业科学研究工作指出了方向，这个方向是：必须密切联系实际，到农民群众中去，向农民群众学习。只有这样，才能为农业生产大跃进服务得更好。
