Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 22nd: The workers of the steelmaking workshop of the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, breaking the mysterious notion of refining high-grade steel, successfully refined Guangdong Province's first batch of silicon steel and welding rod steel, and tinplate steel on the 20th and 19th respectively. The quality of these high-grade alloy steels is very good.

The steelmaking workshop of the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory has always refined ordinary high-quality steel. In the past, the factory had proposed refining alloy steel, but they believed that the technology for refining alloy steel was complex and they lacked experience, so they were afraid to try. Recently, with the encouragement and support of the responsible comrades of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and Guangzhou Municipal Committee, the workers of this factory gave full play to the spirit of daring to think and act, and boldly tried to refine alloy steel. After a day of preparation, they successfully refined one ton of silicon steel using the original steelmaking furnace on the afternoon of the 19th. With the help of the Jiehe Steel Plant, it was pressed into silicon steel sheets with good quality. Welding rod steel and tinplate steel were also successfully refined on the afternoon of the 20th.

    广东炼出第一炉合金钢
    据新华社广州22日电  广州通用机器厂炼钢车间的职工，破除炼高级钢的神秘观念，分别在20日和19日成功地炼出了广东省第一炉硅钢和电焊条钢、马口铁皮钢。这几种高级合金钢的质量都很好。
    广州通用机器厂的炼钢车间一直是炼普通优质钢。过去厂里曾提出过要炼合金钢，但认为炼合金钢的技术复杂，没经验，一直不敢尝试。最近，这个厂的职工在中共广东省委和广州市委的负责同志鼓励和支持下，发挥敢想敢做的精神，大胆试炼合金钢。经一天的准备工作后，19日下午利用原有的炼钢炉，顺利地炼出了一吨硅钢，由捷和钢铁厂帮助压制成硅钢片，质量良好，电焊条钢和马口铁皮钢也在20日下午胜利炼成。
