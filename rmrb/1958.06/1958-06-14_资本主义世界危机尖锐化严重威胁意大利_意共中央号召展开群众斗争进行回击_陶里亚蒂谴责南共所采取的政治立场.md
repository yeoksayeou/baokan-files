Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 13th: The plenary session of the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission of the Italian Communist Party concluded in Rome on the 11th. The meeting discussed the report on the election results made by Deputy General Secretary Longo.

The party's General Secretary Togliatti spoke in the discussion. He emphasized that the great victory achieved by the Italian Communist Party in the parliamentary elections refuted the bourgeoisie's nonsense propaganda that the Italian Communist Party was in a "crisis."

Togliatti said that the victory of the Communist Party in the election proved that the political line formulated by the Party's Eighth Congress was correct. It is precisely because the party has formulated a political line that conforms to the domestic situation that we have continued to move forward even under unfavorable and difficult conditions. He said that in order to achieve new achievements, new and serious struggles must be carried out, and the goals we have set for ourselves are fully achievable.

Togliatti went on to say that the current situation requires extensive political and mass actions, and requires the unity of democratic forces. There is no doubt that unity with the Socialists is the most important part, but it cannot be limited to this and the relationship of unity needs to be expanded. We believe that weakening the ties between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party is wrong under the current conditions in Italy. We believe that the relationship between the two parties should be consolidated as the basis for the development of the entire democratic struggle. Togliatti criticized some people in the Socialist Party for adopting policies and actions that hinder the unity of the two parties.

In the final part of his speech, Togliatti pointed out that the current international situation requires the close unity of all countries in the socialist camp and the entire international workers' movement, because the characteristic of current international life is the existence of the deepest crisis in the imperialist system. He then condemned the ideology of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the political stance it has adopted.

The plenary session passed a resolution approving Longo's report. The resolution stated that vigorous mass struggles and parliamentary struggles must be carried out to reform the social structure of Italy, to repel the serious threats of a slide towards reaction and the outbreak of war, which come from the intensification of the capitalist world crisis; to this end, people of all strata, democratic political groups and left-wing political organizations must act in unison. The Communist Party is a decisive vanguard force in the struggle for new democratic unity and the transformation of our country's political situation.

The resolution said that the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission extend fraternal greetings to the French Communist Party and all the French people who resolutely defend the Republic.

    资本主义世界危机尖锐化严重威胁意大利
    意共中央号召展开群众斗争进行回击
    陶里亚蒂谴责南共所采取的政治立场
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社罗马12日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会和中央监察委员会全体会议11日在罗马闭幕。会议讨论了副总书记隆哥所作的关于选举结果的报告。
    党的总书记陶里亚蒂在讨论中讲了话。他强调指出，意大利共产党在议会选举中所获得的巨大胜利驳斥了资产阶级宣传的意大利共产党发生了“危机”的胡说。
    陶里亚蒂说，共产党在选举中获得的胜利证明党的第八次代表大会所制定的政治路线是正确的。正因为党制定了符合国内局势的政治路线，才使我们甚至在不利和困难的条件下还是继续向前推进。他说，为了取得新的成就，必须进行新的严重的斗争，我们给自己提出的目标是完全能够达到的。
    陶里亚蒂接着说，当前局势要求采取广泛的政治行动和群众行动，要求民主力量团结一致。毫无疑问，同社会党人的团结是最重要的一部分，但是不能只限于这一点而需要把团结的关系加以扩大。我们认为在意大利现在的条件下削弱共产党同社会党的联系是错误的。我们认为应该巩固两党之间的关系，把它作为发展整个民主斗争的基础。陶里亚蒂对于社会党某些人采取妨碍两党团结的政策和行动提出了批评。
    陶里亚蒂在讲话的最后一部分指出，现在已经形成的国际局势要求社会主义阵营各国和整个国际工人运动紧密地团结一致，因为当前国际生活的特点是帝国主义体系存在着最深刻的危机。他接着谴责了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的意识形态和它所采取的政治立场。
    全会通过了批准隆哥的报告的决议。决议说，必须进行声势浩大的群众斗争和议会斗争来革新意大利的社会结构，来击退向反动方向倒退和爆发战争的严重威胁，这种威胁来自资本主义世界危机的尖锐化；为此，必须使各阶层人民、各民主政治团体和左翼政治组织一致行动起来。共产党在争取新的民主团结和我国政局的转变的斗争中是具有决定性的先锋力量。
    决议说，中央委员会和中央监察委员会向坚决保卫共和的法国共产党和全体法国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼。
