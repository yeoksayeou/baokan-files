    Strange Field Growing Strange Things
    The Story of Farmer Chen Leibao's Improvement of Vegetable Varieties
    In the Xianfeng First Cooperative of Tangnan Township, North Suburb District of Shanghai, there is a strange field where many strange things grow. There is something that, at first glance, looks exactly like a tomato plant; but on closer inspection, it is not quite the same. The lower half of its leaves are purple, and the stem is also purple. It is more like an eggplant plant. There is a climbing crop that is clearly a cucumber vine, but its rootstock is sometimes particularly thick, as thick as a pumpkin vine; and sometimes particularly thin, as thin as a loofah vine. What is going on? It turns out that these things are all made by grafting two different crops together. The head of a tomato plant is grafted onto the root of an eggplant plant, resulting in something strangely shaped with the upper half being a tomato and the lower half being an eggplant.

    This field is the experimental field of Chen Leibao, the leader of the Third Team of Xianfeng First Cooperative. Chen Leibao grafts one crop onto another, thereby cultivating a new variety. He calls this method "giving milk."

    Chen Leibao is an ordinary farmer, thirty-three years old this year. He began experimenting with grafting to improve vegetable varieties two years ago, and it has been almost three years now.

    His first experiment was to graft the head of a cucumber plant onto the root of a pumpkin plant. At that time, the cucumbers grown in their cooperative often suffered from bacterial wilt, resulting in significant losses. He wanted to cultivate a new variety of cucumber resistant to bacterial wilt through this experiment. According to his observation, pumpkins are resistant to bacterial wilt among solanaceous plants, so he had the cucumber "drink the milk" of the pumpkin.

    Since last year, he has widely applied the grafting method. Tomatoes are susceptible to heat, so he grafts tomato plants onto heat-resistant eggplant plants; long eggplants are of good quality but slow-growing, so he grafts them onto fast-growing milk eggplants. This year, he discovered that loofah has stronger disease resistance than pumpkin. In addition to continuing to experiment with grafting cucumbers onto pumpkins, he also grafted cucumbers onto loofah. Currently, he is experimenting with a total of five varieties, some of which have already produced new seeds, but further experimentation is needed; some only started this year.

    Recently, he has been constantly observing the growth of various crops in his strange field. This year, he wants to make those tomato plants produce two crops a year. The tomato plants are already bearing fruit, and it is estimated that the first crop can be harvested in July and August. Because eggplants have a long growing season, the growing season of the tomato plants grafted on top can be extended accordingly, and it is estimated that the second crop of tomatoes can be harvested in September.

### 怪田长着怪东西  农民陈雷宝改良蔬菜品种的故事

    怪田长着怪东西
    农民陈雷宝改良蔬菜品种的故事
    上海市北郊区塘南乡先锋一社有一块怪田，在这块田里生长着很多怪东西。有一种东西，你粗粗一看，和番茄秧完全一个样；再细看一下，却又不完全这样了，它下半截的叶子是紫色的，茎也是紫色的，倒不如说它是茄子秧。有一种爬藤作物，明明是黄瓜秧，但它的根茎有的特别粗，粗得像南瓜秧；有的特别细，细得像丝瓜秧。这是怎么一回事呢？原来这些东西都是由两种不同的作物嫁接起来的。把番茄秧的头接在茄子秧的根上，就成了上半截是番茄、下半截是茄子那样奇形怪状的东西。
    这块田是先锋一社三队队长陈雷宝的试验田。陈雷宝把一种作物嫁接在另一种作物上，从而培育出一种新品种来。他把这种方法叫做寄奶。
    陈雷宝是个普通农民，今年三十三岁，他从前年起开始用嫁接法作改良蔬菜品种的试验，至今快三年了。
    他的第一次试验是将黄瓜秧的头接在南瓜秧的根上。那时，他们社里种的黄瓜常患青枯病，损失很大。他想通过这种试验，给黄瓜培育出一种不怕青枯病的新品种来。据他的观察，在茄果类中南瓜是不怕青枯病的，他就叫黄瓜去吃南瓜的奶。
    从去年起他把嫁接方法广泛应用起来。番茄怕热，他就把番茄秧接在不怕热的茄子秧上；条子茄子质量好，但成长慢，他就把它接在成长较快的牛奶茄子上。今年他发现丝瓜的抗疫能力比南瓜还强，他除了继续将黄瓜接在南瓜上作试验外，并把黄瓜接到了丝瓜上面。现在他正在试验的共有五个品种，其中有的已培育出新的种子来，但还须进一步试验；有的今年才开始。
    最近他不断在他的那块怪田里观察各种作物的生长情况。今年他要使那些番茄秧一年两熟，现在番茄秧已在结实了，估计在7、8月份可收到第一熟。因为茄子的生长期长，嫁接在上面的番茄秧的生长期也可相应延长，估计在9月份还可收到第二熟的蕃茄。
