Returning to Sanbian

Green-feathered rooster, don't crow,
White-necked dog, don't bite,
Don't you see who this is?
This is one of our own returning home.
Wearing a worn-out sheepskin coat,
With a white towel wrapped around his head.
Seeing me from afar, I thought,
Judging by the clothes, he looks like someone from Sanbian.
From afar, I dared not recognize you,
My mind asked my mouth, and my mouth asked my mind:
Could it be a relative who left home ten years ago returning?
Could it be an unrelated passerby?
Your voice sounds like you, but I fear my eyes deceive me,
You called me "Auntie," but I dared not answer;
I heard you all went to work in big cities,
Who would have thought you'd be coming home today.
Come quickly into the cave dwelling to warm up,
Sit on the warm kang and have a cup of tea.
Don't stare around with wide eyes,
These past few years have been wonderful.
Look at the new felt and quilts on the kang,
The cave dwelling is full of new furniture.
You haven't had a chance to see the village yet,
I'll take you to the commune headquarters later.
Why did you choose such a cold day to return?
You don't know how beautiful our village is in the summer.
Green trees shading the yellow sand,
The dry land you knew has all become irrigated fields.
People for generations had no way to change it,
But in recent years, we've controlled the old yellow sand.
When the sky was dry and the land barren, it bullied us,
So we dug canals and wells to fight back.
Chairman Mao called for the Great Leap Forward,
A roar erupted from the yellow sand hollows.
Men and women, young and old, are all like tigers,
Never in my life have I seen such a sight.
Don't mind the cold weather,
We're digging wells day and night.
Don't think your Auntie is old,
They even elected me as a tea and water delivery heroine.
You still haven't changed your old habit,
You can't sit still when something's on your mind.
Wait for Auntie to cook you a meal of yellow millet,
Then we'll both go to the well to report for duty.
You've returned at just the right time,
No year has had more energy than this one.
If you had come back three years earlier, the changes wouldn't have been so great,
If you come back three years later, you won't even recognize the road.
Strangers become relatives when they're familiar,
I just love my comrades.
Pick up your chopsticks and eat quickly,
Look how delightful this yellow millet dry rice is!
A big bowl of mutton and glass noodles,
Eat your fill if you want to.
If you're hungry when you're working later,
Everyone will say I didn't take good care of you.
You carry the iron shovel, I'll carry the tea jug,
Let's go to the well and meet the villagers.
In the past, we defeated Hu Zongnan,
Now we're using that same spirit to build a new Sanbian.

    回三边
    李季绿花公鸡不要叫，白脖子狗娃不要咬，你们没看看这是谁？这是咱们家里人回来了。身穿没面子的老羊皮，头上蒙了块白手巾。远远了见我心里想，看穿戴就像咱三边人。远看像你我不敢认，心问口来口问心：莫不是离家十年的亲人回来了？莫不是一个不相干的过路人？听声音像你又怕我眼花，你叫大娘我也不敢答；听说你们都到大地方工作了，谁想到你今天又回家。快进窑里暖一暖，坐到热炕上喝口茶。不要瞪着眼睛四下瞧，这几年的日子可过美啦。你看炕上新毡新被子，满窑洞尽是新家具。你还没顾上看村里，等会我引你到社里去。你回来怎么选了个大冷天？夏天里你不知道咱村有多好看。黄沙绿树一片荫，你们在时的旱地都成了水浇田。人老几辈都没办法，这几年咱们可把老黄沙治住啦。天旱地干欺负人，我们就挖渠打井对付它。毛主席号召大跃进，黄沙窝里一哇声。男女老少都像活老虎，活了一辈子还没见过这光景。不要看天气这么冷，没明没夜打水井。不要看你大娘年岁大，人家还要选我当送茶送水的女英雄。你那个老毛病还没改掉，心里一有事就坐不住了。等大娘烧火给你做顿黄米饭，咱们俩一路到井上去报到。你回来赶的真是巧，哪一年也没有今年干劲高。早回来三年变化还不大，迟回来三年你连路也找不到。自来人熟就是亲，我心里就爱同志们。拿起筷子快吃吧，你看这黄米干饭多爱人！一海碗羊肉和粉条，要吃你就吃个饱。等下劳动时你肚子饿，众人要说我没有招呼好。你扛铁铣我提茶水罐，到井上去跟乡亲们见见面。过去咱们打败了胡宗南，就用那股子干劲建设新三边。
