Female Warriors on the Desert "Ocean"

The Kara Kum Desert in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic is the largest desert in the Soviet Union, covering an area of 300,000 square kilometers. The climate there is extremely variable, with temperatures rising to 50 degrees Celsius at noon and dropping below zero at night. Sand and gravel storms are also frequent visitors there. The Soviet Union has established dozens of weather stations in this vast desert, one of which is called the "Female Garrison Headquarters" because it is staffed by four fearless female warriors.

    沙漠“海洋”上的女将
    土库曼加盟共和国的卡拉库姆沙漠，是苏联最大的沙漠，面积达三十万平方公里。那里的气候变化多端，中午温度上升到五十度（摄氏），而夜里却又降到零下。飞沙走石的风暴更是那里经常的客人。苏联在这个大沙漠上设立了数十个气象站，其中有一个站，人们把它叫做“女卫戍司令部”，因为那里工作的是四名不怕艰难的女将。
