Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 27th: Anhui Province has achieved an unprecedentedly bountiful summer harvest, with a total output of 8.52 billion catties, an increase of over 62% compared to last year. Among them, more than 39.7 million mu of wheat yielded a total of 6.52 billion catties, an increase of 2.52 billion catties compared to last year; the yield per mu increased by over 60%. Many models of high-yield wheat have emerged on both sides of the Huai River, shedding the label of low wheat production. The Paidong No. 1 Cooperative in Liu'an County, with 2,200 mu of wheat, averaged 800 catties per mu, of which 94 mu averaged 1,051 catties per mu. In Funan County, seven agricultural cooperatives achieved an average wheat yield of over 500 catties per mu, with the Hongguang Cooperative's 2.098 mu of wheat fields averaging 2,645 catties and 11 liang per mu. Cadres of the Tonghe Cooperative in Feidong County cultivated 1.2 mu of wheat, which actually yielded 3,648 catties, averaging 3,040 catties per mu. The youth team of the Zhouyi No. 1 Cooperative in Huaiyuan County achieved an even higher yield record, harvesting 2,209 catties and 13 liang of wheat from six fen of land. Even in the polder areas along the Yangtze River, which mainly produce rice, wheat has generally had a good harvest this year. In the Wuhu area alone, there are more than 220,000 mu of wheat fields with a yield of over 500 catties per mu.
    The bumper wheat harvest in Anhui is the result of the people of the province's ideological leap forward, meticulous farming, and persistent struggle against natural disasters.
    Inspired by the general line of socialist construction, Anhui farmers have completed this year's summer harvest quickly and well. In previous years, the summer harvest took half a month, but this year it was completed in just over seven days. At the most intense moment of the summer harvest, more than 8.5 million people across the province worked day and night to rush the harvest, creating a magnificent scene of "people filling the fields during the day and ten thousand lights at night" everywhere. The bountiful harvest has invigorated the people, and the fields are filled with songs of the Great Leap Forward.
    Now, the production focus of Anhui Province has shifted from the busy summer harvest to the urgent task of drought-resistant sowing and drought-resistant seedling protection. The great summer harvest has further encouraged the farmers of the province to strive for a great autumn harvest.

    安徽农民七天完成夏收
    总产量跃增62％
    据新华社合肥27日电　安徽省夏收作物空前丰收，总产量达八十五亿两千万斤，比去年增产62％强。其中三千九百七十多万亩小麦，共收六十五亿两千万斤，比去年增产二十五亿两千万斤；亩产量提高60％强。淮河两岸出现了许多小麦高额丰产典型，摘掉了小麦低产的帽子。六安县渒东一社二千二百亩小麦，平均亩产八百斤，其中九十四亩平均亩产一千零五十一斤。阜南县有七个农业社全社小麦平均亩产五百斤以上，其中红光社二点零九八亩麦田平均亩产二千六百四十五斤十一两。肥东县同合社干部培育的一亩二分小麦，实收三千六百四十八斤，平均亩产三千零四十斤。怀远县周易一社青年队丰产纪录比这还高，六分地就收小麦二千二百零九斤十三两。就是在以生产水稻为主的沿江圩区，今年小麦也普遍丰收。仅芜湖专区亩产五百斤以上的麦田即有二十二万多亩。
    安徽小麦大丰收，是全省人民思想跃进，精耕细作，与自然灾害作顽强斗争的结果。
    在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，安徽农民今年的夏收又快又好。往年夏收要半个月，今年只七天多就完成了。在夏收最紧张的时刻，全省有八百五十多万人不分日夜地突击抢收，到处出现了“白天满地人，夜晚万盏灯”的宏伟图景。丰收使人们精神焕发，田野里到处是跃进的歌声。
    现在，安徽省的生产中心已经由繁忙的夏收转入紧张的抗旱播种、抗旱保苗。夏季大丰收更加鼓舞着全省农民争取秋季大丰收的干劲。
