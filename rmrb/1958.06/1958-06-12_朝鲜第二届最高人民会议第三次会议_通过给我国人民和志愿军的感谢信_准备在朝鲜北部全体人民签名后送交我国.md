Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 11th: The Korean Central News Agency reported today that the Third Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea unanimously passed, at today's meeting, a letter of thanks in the name of all the Korean people to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the great Chinese people.

The entire Korean people, filled with friendship and deep affection for the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the great Chinese people, express unanimous support and approval for this letter of thanks passed by the Supreme People's Assembly, and fully support and welcome this decision of the Supreme People's Assembly, which reflects their common will. The entire Korean people, who will never forget the sincere assistance given by the Chinese people to the Korean people and the meritorious deeds left by the volunteer soldiers, all hope to sign their names on this letter passed by the Supreme People's Assembly. All the people of North Korea are about to begin signing this letter.

This letter will be submitted to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese people after it has been signed by all the people of northern Korea. The full text of the letter of thanks is as follows:

To the Officers and Soldiers of the Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Great Chinese People:

Today, the Korean people bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have established immortal and great merits in the just struggle against the common enemy of the people of North Korea and China—the American imperialist aggressors.

When bidding farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with whom we have shared life and death amidst the smoke and fire of battle, we cannot help but express our greatest gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the fraternal Chinese people.

Dear Chinese Brothers:

The friendship between North Korea and China, which is rooted in the hearts of the people, has a long tradition and has been passed down through history.

The people of the two countries, who have maintained good neighborly relations for a long time, have close ties in culture and have been engaged in a common struggle against foreign imperialist aggressors who have extended their aggressive claws towards the East.

In particular, in those difficult days when Japanese imperialist aggressors annexed Korea and ravaged Chinese territory, revolutionary fighters from both countries, inspired by the ideas of the great October Revolution, fought side by side on the anti-Japanese front.

In the long-term common struggle, a blood-linked friendship and unity was forged between the people of the two countries.

The Korean people were liberated by relying on the great Soviet army; the Chinese revolution achieved victory. In this way, the painful history of oppression and discrimination by foreign aggressors came to an end, and the people of the two countries became masters of their own destiny.

The era of the people's flags flying over the Asian continent has begun, and the people of the two countries are further strengthening their unity on the path of socialism and peace. When the Korean people rose up to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland and launched a just struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, you gave fraternal support without reservation.

In particular, when the Korean people faced the most arduous test, the Chinese people sent the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, composed of their precious sons and daughters, to assist us with their blood.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean people, overcame all kinds of difficulties, launched a heroic struggle, and inflicted devastating blows on the enemy. The soldiers of North Korea and China defeated the American imperialist aggressors and achieved a brilliant victory, which not only gloriously defended the independence and freedom of our country, but also brilliantly defended peace in the Far East and the world.

The Korean armistice, realized by the victory of the people of North Korea and China, is an epoch-making event in which Western imperialist aggressors, for the first time in history, bowed to the people of the East and admitted defeat, and it is also a sign of the arrival of a new era in the East.

In the arduous struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, the brilliant heroism displayed by the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army together with the Korean people has become the pride of all peace-loving and righteous people in the world.

The great merits established by heroes such as Huang Jiguang and Yang Gensi, and thousands of other meritorious individuals, make the ranks of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shine with immense glory.

The mountains and plains, cities and villages, nameless rivers and trees of our country, where the smoke of war has dissipated, all record the merits established by the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting alongside the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army to defend every inch of land, and stories about the noble moral qualities of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are circulating like legends everywhere.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have consistently and faithfully implemented the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong: "Cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree in Korea."

The righteous act of internationalist martyr Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed his life to save a Korean child, is a concrete manifestation of the love of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the Korean people.

The Chinese people sent such benevolent soldiers and also helped us spiritually and materially, and nurtured our war orphans who had suffered misfortune with flesh-and-blood affection.

Your struggle under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to assist the Korean people is a vivid example of proletarian internationalism.

Dear Chinese Brothers!

Since the guns of war ceased in Korea, for more than four years, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, we have achieved great success in the socialist construction of restoring and building the country after the war.

On the ruins of yesterday, modern cities are being built today, and in places where there were piles of scrap iron yesterday, factories have been restored today and are producing nearly three times as much as before the war.

The collectivized countryside is becoming richer year by year. Now, our country's socialist construction has entered a climax.

When the Korean people were carrying out restoration and construction in difficult circumstances after the war, the Chinese people, together with the fraternal people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet people, extended a warm hand of assistance to the Korean people. You gave us 800 million RMB in free aid and sent many technicians to help us. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, before dusting off the war dust, rushed to the construction sites of our restoration, and sweated for our construction with the mindset of building their own hometown and their own houses.

The magnificent socialist construction of North Korea is a victory for the Korean people, a victory for proletarian internationalism, and also a victory for peace over war.

We are exerting creative enthusiasm to build a permanent peace and a socialist home on this land.

The brilliant victory of the Chinese people who are making great strides in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party gives us infinite encouragement in our ongoing struggle.

We rejoice at every achievement of the Chinese people as if it were our own.

The Chinese people have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan and are striving to complete the Second Five-Year Plan, which is advancing by leaps and bounds in socialist construction.

In this way, the People's Republic of China is transforming into a great socialist power.

This is a victory for the Chinese people, and also a victory for socialist forces and peaceful forces.

Dear Chinese Brothers!

The greatest national aspiration of the Korean people is the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The People's Republic of China has always consistently supported the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and maintains that no foreign interference in Korea is allowed, and that the Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

Moreover, according to the joint measures taken by the governments of North Korea and China, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is withdrawing from Korea.

This measure, which has made a great contribution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the consolidation of peace in the Far East, has won unanimous welcome from all kind-hearted people around the world.

The American imperialists, who are occupying South Korea, are today undergoing a severe test before the people of the world.

The American imperialist aggressors must quickly get out of our territory.

Today, the root cause of the suffering of the South Korean people and the misfortune of the entire nation is the American imperialists' occupation of South Korea. The American imperialists have turned South Korea into a living hell unprecedented in history, and the people are trapped in deep water and fire.

The American imperialists are plotting to continue the division of Korea, are frantically manufacturing conspiracies to provoke a new war, and are turning South Korea into a base for the evil atomic war.

Now, the voices of the whole world are ruthlessly judging the evil conspiracy of the American imperialists, and the aggressors and their running dogs are increasingly isolated by the people. Its colonial rule is crumbling.

With the support of peace-loving people around the world, the Korean people will definitely force the American imperialists to withdraw and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

No force can stop the Korean people from advancing.

No matter how mad the enemy is, the Korean people will firmly defend the eastern outpost of peace and the socialist camp.

Today is a historical period in which socialism is achieving a decisive victory on a worldwide scale, and it is a period in which the people of all countries are in charge of their own destiny.

Dear Chinese Brothers!

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which participated in the Korean War to oppose aggressors and safeguard peace, is returning to its motherland to promote the consolidation of peace and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The many great achievements they have made on this land will become immortal epics, passed down forever, and move our descendants.

The stories of the soldiers who came to Korean soil with internationalist aspirations and the poems of friendship will flow endlessly with the Yalu River water that flows through the borders of the two countries; the peaks of Shangganling will stand there for generations as a monument inscribed with the glorious merits of the warriors of peace.

When bidding farewell to our dear brothers, our close comrades-in-arms—the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—we once again express our sincere thanks from the entire nation to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all the Chinese people.

We must strive to further consolidate the friendship between North Korea and China, a friendship forged by the blood of the martyrs of the two countries in the common struggle to safeguard the liberation of the people and the fruits of socialism, a friendship consolidated and developed through close cooperation in hardships, a friendship that has withstood severe tests.

Under the lofty banner of proletarian internationalism, in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we will always forge ahead with the Chinese people.

We wish the Chinese people even more brilliant victories in the struggle to defend the socialist construction and peace of the motherland!

May the fraternal country prosper forever!

Glory belongs to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean people and the Chinese people!

Long live the rock-solid unity of the world socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

The Korean People

    朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第三次会议
    通过给我国人民和志愿军的感谢信
    准备在朝鲜北部全体人民签名后送交我国
    新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜中央通讯社今天报道，朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第三次会议在今天的会议上，一致通过了以全体朝鲜人民的名义给英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵和伟大的中国人民的感谢信。
    对英雄的中国人民志愿军和伟大的中国人民怀着友谊和热爱的深情的全体朝鲜人民对最高人民会议通过的这封感谢信表示一致的支持和赞同，同时完全支持和欢迎反映他们的共同意志的最高人民会议的这一决定。对中国人民给予朝鲜人民的真诚援助和志愿军勇士们所留下的功勋铭志不忘的全体朝鲜人民都希望在最高人民会议通过的这封信上签上自己的名字。全体朝鲜人民即将开始在这封信上签名。
    这封信将在朝鲜北部全体人民签名后送交中国人民志愿军和中国人民。感谢信的全文如下：
    英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵和伟大的中国人民：
    今天，朝鲜人民同在反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争中建立了不朽伟大功勋的中国人民志愿军官兵告别。
    当送别在硝烟弹雨中生死与共的中国人民志愿军官兵的时候，我们情不自禁地对中国人民志愿军官兵和兄弟般的中国人民表示最大的感谢。
    亲爱的中国兄弟们：
    在人民心中生根的朝中友谊具有悠久的传统，在历史上一直绵延相承。
    在悠久的岁月中一直保持着善邻关系的两国人民在文化上有着紧密的联系，并且一直进行了反对向东方伸出侵略的魔掌的外国帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争。
    特别是，在日本帝国主义侵略者吞并朝鲜并且蹂躏中国领土的那些苦难的日子里，两国的革命战士为伟大的十月革命的思想所鼓舞，在抗日战线上并肩作战。
    在长期的共同斗争中，两国人民之间结成了血肉相连的友谊团结。
    朝鲜人民依靠伟大的苏联军队得到解放；中国革命取得了胜利。这样一来，受外国侵略者压迫和歧视的苦难历史便告结束，两国人民成了掌握自己命运的主人。
    亚洲大陆上飘扬着人民的旗帜的时代开始了，两国人民在社会主义和和平的道路上进一步坚强地团结起来。当朝鲜人民奋起捍卫自己祖国的自由与独立，展开反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争的时候，你们就不遗余力地给以兄弟般的声援。
    尤其是，在朝鲜人民面临着最艰苦的考验的时候，中国人民就派遣由自己的宝贵的儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，以鲜血援助了我们。
    中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民一道，克服了种种困难，展开了英雄的斗争，给予敌人以毁灭性的打击。朝中两国人民的战士们打败了美帝国主义侵略者，取得了光辉的胜利，这样不仅光荣地捍卫了我国的独立和自由，而且光辉地保卫了远东和世界和平。
    由于朝中人民的胜利而实现的朝鲜停战，是西方帝国主义侵略者在历史上第一次在东方人民面前屈膝而承认战败的划时代的事件，也是东方的新时代到来的标志。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略者的艰苦斗争中，中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民一起表现出的光辉的英勇精神，成为热爱和平和正义的世界上所有善良人们的骄傲。
    黄继光、杨根思等英雄们和千百名功臣建立的伟大功勋，使中国人民志愿军的队伍发出万丈光芒。
    硝烟已经消散的我国的山峰和平原，城市和村庄，无名小河和树木都记载着中国人民志愿军官兵同朝鲜人民军官兵一道为守卫每一寸土地进行战斗而建立的功勋，无论是什么地方，都像传奇一样流传着关于中国人民志愿军官兵的高贵道德品质的各种故事。
    中国人民志愿军官兵始终一贯忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东主席的指示：“要爱护朝鲜的一山、一水、一草、一木”。
    为抢救朝鲜儿童而献出自己生命的国际主义烈士罗盛教的义举是中国人民志愿军官兵热爱朝鲜人民的具体表现。
    中国人民派来了这样仁义的战士，还在精神上物质上帮助了我们，以骨肉般的情谊扶养了遭到不幸的我们的战争孤儿。
    你们在抗美援朝的旗帜下，为援助朝鲜人民而进行的斗争就是无产阶级国际主义活生生的榜样。
    亲爱的中国兄弟们！
    自从朝鲜的炮声停止以后，四年多来，我们在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在战后恢复建设国家的社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。
    在昨天的废墟上，今天建立起现代化的城市，在昨天还是一堆废铁的地方，今天有工厂恢复起来了，并且生产出将近等于战前三倍的产品。
    实现了合作化的农村一年比一年富饶。现在，我国的社会主义建设已经进入了高潮。
    当朝鲜人民在战后艰难的环境中进行恢复建设的时候，中国人民同以苏联人民为首的社会主义阵营国家的兄弟人民一道，又向朝鲜人民伸出温暖的援助的手。你们给予我们八亿人民币的无偿援助，还派来许多技术人员帮助了我们。中国人民志愿军官兵还没有拂掉身上的战尘，就奔向我们的恢复建设的工地，以建设自己的家乡、自己的房屋的心情，为我们的建设流了汗。
    朝鲜的宏伟的社会主义建设是朝鲜人民的胜利，是无产阶级国际主义的胜利，同时也是和平对战争的胜利。
    我们为了在这块土地上建设永久的和平和社会主义的家园，发挥着创造的热情。
    在中国共产党的领导下在社会主义建设中大跃进的中国人民的辉煌胜利，给予我们正在进行的斗争以无限的鼓舞。
    我们把中国人民的每一个成就当作自己的成就一样而感到高兴。
    中国人民已经胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，并且为完成在社会主义建设中大步前进的第二个五年计划而斗争。
    这样，中华人民共和国正在转变为伟大的社会主义强国。
    这是中国人民的胜利，也是社会主义力量和和平力量的胜利。
    亲爱的中国兄弟们！
    朝鲜人民最大的民族愿望是祖国的和平统一。中华人民共和国始终一贯地支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争，并且主张不容许任何外国干涉朝鲜，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己解决。
    不仅如此，根据朝中两国政府采取的共同措施，中国人民志愿军正在从朝鲜撤出。
    对朝鲜的和平统一和巩固远东和平作出巨大贡献的这一措施，博得了全世界善良人们的一致欢迎。
    强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义者，今天在世界人民面前正受着严重的考验。
    美帝国主义侵略者要赶快从我们的疆土上滚出去。
    今天，南朝鲜人民所遭受的痛苦和全民族的不幸的根源，就是美帝国主义者对南朝鲜的强占。美帝国主义把南朝鲜变成千古未闻的活地狱，人们陷于水深火热之中。
    美帝国主义者策划继续分裂朝鲜，正在疯狂制造挑起新战争的阴谋，并且正在把南朝鲜变为罪恶的原子战争的基地。
    现在，全世界的呼声在无情地对美帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋进行审判，侵略者及其走狗日益被人民孤立起来。它的殖民统治正在土崩瓦解。
    朝鲜人民在世界爱好和平人民的声援下，一定要迫使美帝国主义者撤走，达成祖国的和平统一。
    没有任何力量能够阻挡朝鲜人民前进。
    不管敌人怎样疯狂，朝鲜人民也将坚强地保卫和平和社会主义阵营的东方前哨阵地。
    今天是社会主义在全世界范围内取得决定性胜利的历史时期，是各国人民自己掌握自己命运的时期。
    亲爱的中国兄弟们！
    为了反对侵略者和维护和平而参加朝鲜战争的中国人民志愿军，为了促进和平的巩固和朝鲜的和平统一，返回自己的祖国。他们在这块土地上立下的许许多多的伟大功勋，将成为不朽的史诗，永远地流传下去，感动着我们的子孙后代。
    怀着国际主义的志向来到朝鲜土地上的战士的故事和友谊的诗歌，将同穿流在两国边境上的鸭绿江水一起长流不息；上甘岭的峰峦将作为一个铭刻着和平战士辉煌的功勋的纪念塔而世世代代耸立在那里。
    当欢送我们的亲兄弟、亲近的战友——中国人民志愿军官兵的时候，我们再一次向中国人民志愿军官兵和全体中国人民致以全民的衷心的感谢。
    我们要努力进一步巩固朝中友谊，这种友谊是两国烈士在为维护人民的解放和社会主义果实的共同斗争中所流的鲜血结成的，这种友谊是在千辛万苦中通过亲密的合作而巩固发展起来的，这种友谊是经过了严峻的考验的。
    我们在无产阶级国际主义崇高的旗帜下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭里，要始终不渝地同中国人民一起勇往直前。
    祝中国人民在保卫祖国社会主义建设和和平的斗争中取得更加辉煌的胜利！
    兄弟的国家，祝您永远繁荣！
    光荣属于英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵！
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界社会主义阵营的坚如磐石的团结一致万岁！
                          朝鲜人民
                    一九五八年六月十一日
