    Actor Who Rescued State Property

    On May 12th, after the second performance team of the Jiangxi Provincial Drama Troupe finished their performance in Shanggao County, a flash flood suddenly occurred. The water in the Jin River rose sharply and was about to flood the department store's warehouse. At this time, the actors of the drama troupe, disregarding the fatigue from their consecutive performances, rushed to the warehouse to salvage materials in order to rescue state property. The seven actresses were no less capable than the male comrades, carrying bags of cement weighing over a hundred pounds on their backs, and running very fast. After moving all the goods in the warehouse to a safe place, they busied themselves with moving other things.

    抢救国家财产的演员
    5月12日，江西省话剧团第二演出队在上高县演完戏以后，突然山洪暴发，锦河里的水猛涨，很快就要淹进百货公司的仓库里面去了，这时话剧团的演员们，为了抢救国家的财产，顾不得连日来演出的疲劳，就跑去仓库里抢运物资。七个女演员，并不亚于男同志，一百多斤一包的水泥压在背上，还跑得飞快。把仓库里的货物都搬到安全的地方以后，他们又忙着去搬别的东西了。
