　　Character Introduction

　　The Bold Visionary
　　Soviet Scientist Tsiolkovsky
　　A memorial statue of Tsiolkovsky, the founder of jet propulsion technology and interplanetary travel theory, was solemnly unveiled on June 1 in the ancient Soviet city of Kaluga. This memorial was built at the initiative of the Soviet government to commemorate the centenary of the birth of this great Soviet scientist. A four-meter-high bronze statue stands on a five-meter-high, polished granite pedestal. Next to the memorial stands a seventeen-meter-high rocket shining with silvery-white light, as if about to soar into the sky, symbolizing the scientist's scientific ideal of flying to the universe.
　　Standing in front of the bronze statue of this scientific giant, one cannot help but think of the three Soviet artificial satellites launched not long ago, representing the brilliant achievements of mankind, and the scientist's arduous struggle and imaginative life.
　　Tsiolkovsky was born in 1857 in the village of Izhevsk, Ryazan Province, Russia, to a forester's family. At the age of nine, he unfortunately contracted scarlet fever and became completely deaf in both ears. Deafness and poverty made it impossible for him to attend school. This lonely child had to rely on self-study to acquire knowledge.
　　Thanks to his diligent study, Tsiolkovsky began working as a mathematics teacher at the age of twenty. During his long teaching career of forty years, in addition to sincerely and diligently doing his job as a teacher, he also squeezed time to study astronomy, chemistry, and especially aviation science. He loved to fantasize since he was a child. When he was only eight years old, he received a toy hydrogen balloon from his mother. This balloon sowed the seeds of scientific fantasy of flying into the sky and the infinite universe in his little mind. These seeds germinated and grew vigorously during his time as a mathematics teacher.
　　One day, Tsiolkovsky saw several swallows skimming across the overcast sky before a thunderstorm, and countless fantasies boiled in his mind: people must be able to fly faster than swallows, and airships like sharks appeared before him. This wonderful ideal drove him to conduct day and night research and calculations. Neighbors called him a "bold visionary." Soon, he wrote an article on metal airships and went to Moscow with excitement and shyness. The famous physicist Stoletov received this middle school teacher from a remote town, read his work, and invited this modest, even somewhat shy, teacher to give a report to thousands of famous physicists in Moscow. Scientists expressed admiration and admiration for his highly scientific work written without expert guidance and complete instruments. Zhukovsky, the "father of Russian aviation," gave his work a high evaluation.
　　The day after Tsiolkovsky returned to his hometown with a victorious mood, his house caught fire, and the books, manuscripts, and simple instruments left in the house were all reduced to ashes. He fell ill due to the blow of this disaster. However, his indomitable spirit made him stubbornly continue his research. In 1892, Tsiolkovsky published a paper: "Controllable Metal Balloon." In 1895, he published another book - "Aircraft - a Machine Like a Bird." In this book, he described the theory and calculation of flight, and the aircraft he designed almost had all the characteristics of modern aircraft.
　　While studying metal airships, Tsiolkovsky paid attention to the rocket problem. The idea of flying to the vast universe was always in his heart. As he himself said: "In the beginning, it is inevitable to have: thinking, fantasy, speculation, followed by scientific calculation, and in the end, fantasy will always be realized." Yes, his ideals are gradually being realized. In 1903, he published a paper entitled "Exploring the Universe with Jet Propulsion" in the "Science Review" magazine, and for the first time in scientific history, he put forward the principle of jet propulsion. In this article, he elaborated on the ideal of space flight and the possibility of its realization, and called himself a "citizen of the universe."
　　It was the Soviet regime that truly enabled Tsiolkovsky's genius to be fully developed and his ideals to be realized. After the October Revolution, thanks to the care and help of the Party and the government, he built giant spacecraft models and a batch of jet propulsion engines, and published important scientific works such as "Cosmic Rocket Train," which elaborated on the principle of multi-stage rockets.
　　In 1935, this great scientist of the Soviet people passed away, but his ideals have been inherited and developed by the Soviet working people. The invention of high-speed jet aircraft, intercontinental missiles, and artificial satellites are inseparable from Tsiolkovsky's achievements. The era predicted by this scientist, in which mankind "will first cautiously step out of the atmosphere, and then boldly conquer the entire solar system," has arrived!

### 大胆的幻想家  苏联科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基

　　大胆的幻想家
    苏联科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基
    喷气技术和行星际交通理论的奠基人齐奥尔科夫斯基的纪念像于6月1日在苏联古老的卡卢加城隆重揭幕了。这个纪念像是根据苏联政府的倡议，为纪念这位伟大的苏联科学家诞生一百周年而建成的。一座高四公尺的铜像屹立在高达五公尺的光亮的花岗石台座上。纪念像旁立着一支闪耀着银白色光辉的十七公尺高的火箭，它像要凌空飞去，象征着这位科学家的飞向宇宙的科学理想。
    站立在这个科学巨人的铜像面前，使人不禁想起不久以前发射的三个代表人类辉煌成就的苏联人造卫星，想起这个科学家艰苦奋斗和富有幻想意味的一生。
    齐奥尔科夫斯基于1857年生于俄国列山省伊柴夫斯克村一个守林人的家里。他在九岁的时候，不幸患了猩红热，两只耳朵完全变聋了。耳聋和家境贫困使他没法进学校读书。这个孤苦的孩子于是只得靠自学来求得学问。
    由于自己的刻苦钻研，齐奥尔科夫斯基二十岁便开始当数学教师。在漫长的四十年的教学生活中，他除了诚恳努力做好一个教师外，还挤时间自学天文学、化学、特别是航空科学。他从小就爱幻想。当他只有八岁的时候，他从母亲那里得到一个氢气球的玩具，这个气球在他小小的头脑中撒下了飞向天空和无穷的宇宙的科学幻想的种子。这些种子在他当数学教师时期，由萌芽而至茁壮成长起来了。
    一天，齐奥尔科夫斯基看见窗外有几只燕子在雷雨前的阴霾密布的天空中疾掠而过，无数的幻想在他脑中沸腾起来：人一定能够比燕子飞得更快，他的面前出现了像鲛鱼一样的飞艇。美妙的理想驱使他去进行日以继夜的研究和计算。邻人们都称他为“大胆的幻想家”。不久，他写好一篇有关金属飞船的文章，怀着兴奋而腼腆的心情去到莫斯科。著名的物理学家斯托列托夫接见了这个来自偏僻小镇的中学教师，读了他的著作，并且邀请这个谦虚、甚至有些怕羞的教师给莫斯科成千的著名的物理学家们作报告。科学家们对他这个在没有专家指导和完备仪器条件下写成的具有高度科学水平的著作表示赞叹和钦佩，“俄国航空之父”茹科夫斯基对他的著作给予很高评价。
    当齐奥尔科夫斯基带着胜利的心情回到故乡的第二天，他家里失了火，留在家里的书籍、原稿、简单的仪器都化为灰烬。他因受到这个灾难的打击而病倒了。然而，不屈不挠的精神又使他顽强地继续进行研究。1892年，齐奥尔科夫斯基发表了一篇论文：“可操纵的金属气球”。1895年，他又出版了一本著作——“飞机——像飞鸟的机器”。在这本书里他叙述了飞行的理论和计算，他所设计的飞机已差不多具有现代飞机的一切特点了。
    齐奥尔科夫斯基在研究金属飞艇的同时就注意到火箭问题。飞向广大宇宙空间去的思想，永远存在他的心上。正如他自己所说的：“开始的时候免不了是：思索、幻想、臆测，紧跟着就是科学计算，到头来幻想总会实现的。”是的，他的理想在逐步实现了。1903年，他在“科学评论”杂志上发表了一篇题为“利用喷气机来探测宇宙”的论文，在科学史上第一次提出了喷气推进的原理。在这篇文章里，他阐述了宇宙飞行的理想及其实现的可能，并且自称为“宇宙的公民”。
    真正使齐奥尔科夫斯基的天才得到高度发挥、理想得到实现的是苏维埃政权。十月革命后，由于党和政府的关怀与帮助，他制造了巨型飞船模型和一批喷气推进机，并且发表了阐明多级火箭原理的“宇宙火箭列车”等重要科学著作。
    1935年，苏联人民这位伟大科学家逝世了，然而他的理想却被苏联劳动人民所继承和发展着。高速度的喷气式飞机、洲际导弹、人造卫星的发明都是与齐奥尔科夫斯基的功绩分不开的。这位科学家所预言的人类“起初会小心翼翼地越出大气层的范围，然后大胆地征服整个太阳系”的时代已经到来了！
