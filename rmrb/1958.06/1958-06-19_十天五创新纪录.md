    Ten Days, Five New Records
    As soon as the Party's General Line and the call to surpass Britain ahead of schedule were announced, the workers of our small blast furnace were full of energy and immediately took action, launching a new high tide of production leap forward. In the past ten days, our manganese iron production has leaped again and again, continuously creating five new records. The daily output increased from the May high of 43 tons to 53 tons, and the recovery rate of manganese iron reached 88.3%.
    In May, the highest utilization coefficient of our small blast furnace only reached 0.763%. This time, we boldly broke with conventions, reducing the material line in the furnace from the past 800 mm to 2.2 meters, making the utilization coefficient reach 0.54%. We increased the number of batches of charging per hour from the past five batches to seven batches, further exploiting the iron tapping capacity of the small blast furnace.
    Because the number of batches of charging increased, loading became difficult. So everyone contributed ideas and came up with solutions to improve the material bin. This not only ensured the needs of the blast furnace but also saved labor and reduced labor intensity.
    Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. We must continue to exert our efforts, catch up with the advanced, strive for the upstream, and never give up until we surpass Britain ahead of schedule.

    十天五创新纪录
    党的总路线和要提前赶过英国的号召一公布，我们小高炉的工人就满身是劲，说干就干，掀起了一个新的生产跃进高潮。近十天内，我们的锰铁产量就一跃再跃，连续创造五次新纪录。日产量由5月份最高纪录四十三吨提高到五十三吨，锰铁的回收率达到88.3％。
    5月份我们的小高炉利用系数的最高纪录才达到0.763％。这次我们大胆打破了陈规，把炉内的料线由过去的八百米毫降低到两公尺二，使利用系数达到0.54％。我们把每小时下料的批数由过去的五批增加到七批，进一步发挥小高炉出铁的能量。
    由于下料批数增加，上料发生困难。我们就人人献计策，个个想办法，改进了料仓，这样不仅保证高炉的需要，还节省了人力，减轻了劳动。
    当然，我们不能满足现有的成绩，还要继续鼓足干劲，赶先进，争上游，不提前赶过英国，誓不罢休。石景山钢铁厂炼铁部　郭会堂
