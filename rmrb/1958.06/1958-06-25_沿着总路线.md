    Following the General Line, Following the General Line, the whole Party is working hard. A thousand catties per mu of grain must be realized. Zeal and persistence surpass diamond drills. Even hard steel plates must be drilled through.

    沿着总路线沿着总路线，全党拚命干。亩产千斤粮，一定要实现。干劲和钻劲，赛过金钢钻。就是硬钢板，也要把它钻。
          （山东广饶）
