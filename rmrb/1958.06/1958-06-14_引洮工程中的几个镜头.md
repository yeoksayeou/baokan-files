Several Scenes from the Water Diversion Project
By our reporters Zhang Ming and Zhai Qiyin

	On the newly built roads leading to various work areas, the migrant workers, carrying red flags and luggage, streamed in an endless flow; trucks, horse-drawn carts, and oxcarts loaded with construction materials and supplies raced forward. On the stone walls and tree trunks near the construction site, inspiring slogans were posted: "We must make the Guan Mountain give way and the Huajia Ridge bow its head!" "We vow not to return home until the Tao River project is completed!"

	In January of this year, route surveying began. The Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, the Zhouzhou Hydroelectric Survey and Design Institute, and the Dingxi Special District Party and government departments dispatched more than 100 cadres to form three survey teams. Braving the heavy snow and wind, they traversed mountains and valleys, completing the surveying task of over a thousand kilometers in less than a month.

	Following the surveying was measurement and design. More units participated this time, with the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Yellow River School also sending personnel to assist. This measurement and design team of more than 800 people, with the same enthusiasm as during the surveying, waded back and forth in the icy river water and selected the best routes in the mountains. In just over two months, they completed the fixed-line measurement of more than 300 kilometers, enabling the early start of the Water Diversion Project.

	The more than 300 kilometers of canals to be built this year are estimated to require more than 14 million yuan. Apart from the state investment of 2 million yuan, the rest will be resolved through mass fundraising. A county party secretary in Yuzhong County took the lead by donating 700 yuan. Longxi County raised 1.5 million yuan. An elementary school teacher contributed all 300 yuan he had saved to the Water Diversion Project. Many people expressed that "hardship for one year brings happiness for ten thousand years," so they contributed as much money as they could to this water conservancy project.

	To support the Water Diversion Project, provincial-level agencies, as well as counties, townships, and communes, launched large-scale material collection campaigns. Provincial-level agencies extracted a total of more than 250 types of materials, approximately 8,000 pieces, from their warehouses and offices and handed them over to the Water Diversion Project Bureau. This allowed the bureau to get started without spending a single penny.

	After the Water Diversion Project was widely mobilized, agricultural cooperatives launched an enrollment upsurge. Some cooperatives saw almost 100% of their members sign up. With a large number of laborers being drawn to build water conservancy projects, what about the crops? The women proposed to be able to plow the land, fertilize, sow seeds, and use seeders, taking on the crop work.

    引洮工程中的几个镜头
    本报记者  张鸣  翟其寅
    在通往各个工区的新修的公路上，扛着红旗、背着行李的民工们，络绎不绝；满载各种建筑器材和给养的汽车、马车和牛车，争先恐后地疾驶着。在工地附近村庄的石壁上和树干上，都张贴着激动人心的标语：“要叫关山让路，让华家岭低头”！“不修完洮河工程誓不还家！”            
    今年1月间开始踏勘线路，甘肃省水利局、铁道部第一设计院、辵州水电勘测设计院、定西专区党政部门，就抽出一百多个干部，组成了三个踏勘队。他们冒着大风雪，翻山越岭，不到一个月，千余公里的踏勘任务就完成了。        
    踏勘以后，接着是测量设计。这次参加的单位更多，黄河水利委员会、黄河学校也派人来支援。这支八百多人测量设计队伍，和踏勘时一样，热情奔放，在冰冷的河水里涉来涉去，在万山丛中选择最好的线路，仅仅两个多月，就完成了三百多公里的一段定线测量，从而使引洮工程提前开工。
    今年动工兴建的三百多公里的渠道，估计需要一千四百多万元，除国家投资二百万以外，其余全由群众集资解决。榆中县一位县委书记带头拿出七百元，陇西全县集资一百五十万元，有一位小学教师，把自己节省下来的三百元全部投入引洮工程。很多群众表示，“困难一年，幸福万年”，因此能够拿出来的钱，都尽量投到这个水利工程上。                                                        
    为了支援引洮工程，省级各机关，以及县、乡、社都展开了大规模的筹集物资运动。省级各机关从自己的仓库中、办公室里共抽出二百五十多种约八千多件物资，交给引洮水利工程局，这个工程局没花一文钱就把摊子铺开了。
    当引洮工程进行普遍动员以后，各农业社就展开了报名热潮，有的社几乎是100％的社员报了名。抽出大批劳动力修水利，庄稼怎么办呢？妇女们便提出要做到能耕地、撒肥、溜籽、使用播种机，把庄稼活包下来。
