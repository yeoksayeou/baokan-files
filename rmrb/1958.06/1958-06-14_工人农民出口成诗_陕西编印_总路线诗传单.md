    Workers and Peasants Spontaneously Compose Poetry
    Shaanxi Publishes "General Line Poetry Leaflet"
    Since the announcement of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Writers Association and the Shaanxi Provincial Folk Song Compilation Group immediately compiled and printed the "General Line Poetry Leaflet." It is the size of an octavo newspaper, published every three days, with a print run of over 50,000 copies per issue. In addition to some writers, the majority of contributors are workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres, with most works adopting the form of folk songs and ballads, which is why it has been enthusiastically welcomed by the working people. In the past two weeks alone, more than 1,200 poems have been received from workers and peasants. Three issues have already been published.
    The "General Line Poetry Leaflet" has spread to countless villages and factories in the 800-li Qin Chuan plain. In the fields and in the factories, peasants and workers enthusiastically recite the poetry leaflet and write their own creations for publication. Workers at the Xianyang No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill rush to read the poetry leaflet after work. Li Yusen, a worker in the machine repair workshop, wrote a poem for the poetry leaflet: "The General Line, shining bright, is like the sun, moon, and stars in the sky, shining day and night; illuminating the land red all over, making the ocean boil together, everyone united and rushing forward, surpassing lame old England in fifteen years." Bridge worker Zhang Youcai also wrote a poem: "Bridge workers fear no hardship, traveling all over the mountains and rivers, fighting north and south to be heroes, building bridges across the rivers of the motherland."
    The poetry leaflet has published many works by members of agricultural cooperatives. Li Qianghua, a member of the Five-Star Fourth Cooperative in Hu County, wrote: "Eight hundred li of Qin Chuan, a golden yellow, eight hundred li of Qin Chuan, full of fragrance; Qinling and Ba Mountains wear yellow pythons, covering the sky and earth with golden light. Millions of sickles shining bright, millions of carts lined up in rows, millions of people singing the Great Leap Forward, millions of wheat fields busy harvesting. Teams of red flags fluttering in the wind, stacks of wheat piled like mountain ridges; strings of stone rollers tightly threshing, carts of wheat entering the granary." After reading reports of Chairman Mao and central leaders participating in labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir, Guo Wenhua, a peasant from Tongguan County, immediately wrote a poem: "People's leader Mao Zedong, with a good style of diligence and thrift; leading the central committee members, going to labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir, Chairman Mao digging soil busily, shoveling each shovelful into the basket; millions of eyes watching him together, millions of people feeling more strength."

    工人农民出口成诗
    陕西编印“总路线诗传单”
    据新华社讯  社会主义建设总路线公布以后，中国作家协会西安分会和陕西省民歌整理组立即编印了“总路线诗传单”。它的篇幅有八开报纸那么大，三天一期，每期印数五万多份。写稿的除一些作家外，绝大部分都是工人、农民和一些基层干部，作品大部采用民歌民谣形式，因此受到劳动人民热烈欢迎。最近半月多来，收到来自工农群众中的诗歌就有一千二百多首。现已出刊三期。
    “总路线诗传单”已经传到了八百里秦川无数的村庄和厂矿。在田间，在工厂，农民和工人热情地朗诵着诗传单，并把自己的创作写给它发表。咸阳国棉二厂的工人们下工后，纷纷找诗传单来读。修机车间工人李余森给诗传单写了一首诗：“总路线，亮晶晶，好比天上日月星，昼夜不停放光明；照得大地红通通，照得海洋齐沸腾，万众一心奔前程，十五年越过跛狮英。”桥梁工人张佑才也写了一首：“桥梁工人不怕难，千山万水要跑遍，南征北战当好汉，桥梁架满祖国河川。”
    诗传单上刊载了许多农业社社员的创作。鄠县五星四社社员李强华写道：“八百里秦川一片黄，八百里秦川一片香；秦岭巴山穿黄蟒，铺天盖地闪金光。千万把镰刀明晃晃，千万辆马车排成行，千万人歌唱大跃进，千万片麦田里收麦忙。一队队的红旗随风扬，一垛垛麦堆像山梁；一串串碎碡紧碾场，一车车麦子进了仓。”潼关县农民郭文华看了报载毛主席和中央负责同志到十三陵参加劳动的消息后，立刻写了一首诗：“人民领袖毛泽东，勤劳俭朴好作风；率领中央众委员，十三陵水库去劳动，毛主席挖土忙，一锨一锨送进筐；千万人眼睛齐看他，千万人身上添力量。”
