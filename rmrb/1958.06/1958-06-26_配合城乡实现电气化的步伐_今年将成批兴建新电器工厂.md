Xinhua News Agency, June 25th. To meet the needs of urban and rural electrification, the First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to add twenty to thirty new factories for manufacturing electrical equipment this year, in addition to the original plan.

These newly built factories are distributed in seventeen provinces and cities, including Yunnan, Sichuan, Anhui, and Beijing. Once they are all put into production, their annual capacity for manufacturing complete sets of power generating equipment alone will reach over 10 million kilowatts, equivalent to seventeen times the total power generator production capacity this year. In addition, they can also produce many electrical products, such as electric motors, transformers, switches, and various wires and cables.

Currently, the design drawings for these new factories are mostly ready, and materials and construction teams have begun to be mobilized. Some have already started construction. Except for a few large factories, efforts will be made to complete them by next year.

"Decentralized and regional distribution, achieving widespread implementation" is the construction policy adopted by China's motor industry to rapidly meet the needs of national electrification. Following this first batch of newly added projects this year, the First Ministry of Machine Building also plans to establish thousands of electrical factories of various types across the country. In this way, by 1962, each economic cooperation region and province will have a set of large and medium-sized electrical bases.

    配合城乡实现电气化的步伐
    今年将成批兴建新电器工厂
    新华社25日讯　配合城乡实现电气化的需要，第一机械工业部决定在今年原订计划以外，再增加建设二、三十个制造电器设备的新工厂。
    这批新建工厂分布在云南、四川、安徽、北京等十七个省市。它们全部投入生产以后，每年仅制造成套发电设备的能力，就将达到一千万瓩以上，相当于今年全部发电机生产能力的十七倍。此外，还能生产许多电器产品，如电动机、变压器、开关和各种电线、电缆等。
    目前，这批新工厂的设计图纸已经大部分准备就绪，材料和施工队伍也都已经开始调集，有的已经开始施工。除个别大型工厂，明年都可以争取建成。
    “分级分区布点，做到遍地开花”，这是我国电机工业为迅速满足全国电气化的需要而采取的建设方针。继今年增加的第一批新建工程以后，第一机械工业部还准备在全国各地建立起千百个各种类型的电器工厂。这样，到1962年，各个经济协作区域和省都将有一套大中型的电工基地。
