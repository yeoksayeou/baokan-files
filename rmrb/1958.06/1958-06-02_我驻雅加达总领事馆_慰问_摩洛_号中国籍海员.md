Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 31st. The Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta yesterday sent representatives to express their condolences to the twenty-two Chinese seamen from the "Moro" ship, which was sunk by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek planes. These Chinese seamen, who have arrived in Jakarta successively, expressed their deep gratitude for the care shown by the Chinese Consulate General.

The "Moro" was a vessel of the Hong Kong Da Hing Shipping Company. It was sunk on April 28 in the waters off Langara Port in Central Sulawesi by U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek planes that were aiding the Indonesian rebel group.

The seamen described the circumstances of the sinking to the representatives of the Consulate General in detail and condemned the atrocities of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek planes. When they saw the news in the newly republished Jakarta Chinese newspapers that the Indonesian government had captured American pilots who were helping the Indonesian rebels, they expressed extreme anger at the atrocities of the American pilots who were helping the Indonesian rebels slaughter innocent people and demanded that the captured American pilots be brought to trial. They also pointed out that the United States and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique must be held responsible for the incident of bombing and killing and injuring Chinese seamen and must compensate them for their losses.

    我驻雅加达总领事馆
    慰问“摩洛”号中国籍海员
    据新华社雅加达31日电　中国驻雅加达总领事馆昨天派遣代表，慰问了被美蒋飞机炸沉的“摩洛”号轮船上的二十二名中国籍海员。陆续到达雅加达的这些中国籍海员对中国总领事馆的关怀表示非常感激。
    “摩洛”号是香港大兴轮船公司的船只，它是在4月28日在中苏拉威西的浪加拉港海面被帮助印度尼西亚叛乱集团的美蒋飞机炸沉的。
    海员们向总领事馆的代表详细叙述了船只被炸沉的情况。并且谴责美蒋飞机的暴行。当他们从刚刚复刊的雅加达中文报纸上看到印度尼西亚政府俘获帮助印度尼西亚叛军的美国飞行员的消息以后，对美国飞行员帮助印度尼西亚叛军屠杀无辜人民的暴行表示非常愤怒，并且要求把被俘的美国飞行员提交审判。他们还指出，美国和台湾蒋介石集团必须对炸死、炸伤中国海员的事件负责，并且赔偿他们损失。
