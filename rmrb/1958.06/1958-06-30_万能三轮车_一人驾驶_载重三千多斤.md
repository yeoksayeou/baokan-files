    All-Purpose Tricycle
    One Person Operation, Carries Over 3,000 Jin
    Chen Yuda and other members of the Hemo Agricultural Cooperative in Cenxi County, Guangxi, have successfully created an "all-purpose automatic tricycle".
    This tricycle only needs one person to operate it like a bicycle, and it can carry 3,000 to 5,000 jin, travelling at ten *li* per hour. This vehicle can also travel on slopes of about 30 degrees. It can also pull plows and other tools for farming in the fields. Therefore, it is called the "all-purpose automatic tricycle".
    The body of the vehicle is made of thirty wooden pillars, two to five *chi* long. Under the body are three wooden wheels, one in the front and two in the back. There is also an iron lever axle, with a lever wheel on the axle. On each side of the vehicle is an iron flywheel. There are five gears of various sizes connecting the lever wheel, the flywheel, and the wooden wheels respectively. When driving, a person sits on the seat and pedals the pedals connected to the lever axle, pushing the lever wheel. The lever wheel then drives the flywheel through the gears. The flywheel drives the two rear wooden wheels through the gears. The rear wooden wheels push the front wooden wheel, and the vehicle moves forward. The front wheel is also equipped with a steering wheel (also known as the front wheel handle) to control the direction of travel. If the flywheel is pushed backwards, the vehicle can also move backwards.

    万能三轮车
    一人驾驶　载重三千多斤
    广西岑溪县河木农业社社员陈裕达等创造“万能自动三轮车”成功。
    这部三轮车只需用一个人像驾驶一架单车那样，就可载重三千斤到五千斤，每小时运行十华里。这车还可以走三十度左右的斜坡路。又可牵引犁耙等工具在田里耕作。所以它叫做“万能自动三轮车”。
    车身是用三十条二尺到五尺长的木柱架成，车身下面有三个木车轮，一个在前，两个在后。另有一个铁制的杠杆轴，轴上有杠杆轮，车的两傍各装一个铁制的飞轮，另有五个大大小小的齿轮分别连着杠杆轮、飞轮和木车轮。开车时，一个人坐在坐板上，用脚踩动连着杠杆轴的脚踏板，推动杠杆轮，杠杆轮再通过齿轮带动飞轮，飞轮通过齿轮带动后面的两个木车轮，后木车轮推动前木车轮，车子就前进了。车的前轮上还装有驾驶盘（又名前轮把手），可以控制行车方向。如将飞轮往后推动，车身又可后退。
