　　"June 25th" – Korean People's Day of Struggle Against America
　　Li Yong-ho, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China

　　Eight years ago today, American imperialism launched a barbaric war of aggression in order to enslave our country and our people, and subjected our people to the ravages of war for three years. Today, all the Korean people greet the eighth anniversary of "June 25th" with incomparable national indignation. We want to expose and denounce to the world the policy of national division and the heinous atrocities committed by American imperialism in Korea, and we are determined not to rest until the peaceful reunification of our country is achieved.

　　From the very first day it set foot in Korea, American imperialism embarked on a path of blatant crime in order to strangle the freedom and independence of the Korean people. After the Japanese fascist army was crushed in Korea by the Soviet army in August 1945, the American imperialist aggressor troops landed in South Korea in September without firing a single shot, and immediately implemented military rule, suppressing and disbanding the people's power organs organized by the Korean people according to their own free will, and suppressing democratic parties, people's organizations and democratic figures. American imperialism frantically directed pro-Japanese national traitors and local bullies to organize so-called national defense guard units, coast guard units, and puppet armies under its wings, while frantically establishing military bases in South Korea.

　　After the signing of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution in December 1945 regarding the future establishment of a provisional democratic government in Korea, American imperialism, in order to undermine this resolution signed by its own government, instructed its loyal lackey Syngman Rhee to actively launch a movement against the resolution, openly imprisoning parties, people's organizations, and individuals who supported the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, illegally suppressing the people's forces, and disregarding the opposition of the Korean people, using guns and knives to protect pro-Japanese national traitors and pro-American factions. On May 10, 1948, it conducted a separate election in South Korea, and illegally created a South Korean puppet government in August of the same year. On the 24th of the same month, the "Korean-American Provisional Military Agreement" was signed, increasing the puppet army to eight divisions by the end of 1949; in January 1950, the "Korean-American Military Assistance Agreement" and the "Advisory Group Agreement" were signed, completely seizing control of the puppet army. After that, from April to May 1950, the puppet army was gathered around the 38th parallel, further creating provocative incidents and waiting for an opportunity to carry out aggression.

　　Faced with such a national crisis, the Korean people launched a nationwide struggle against the "May 10th" treasonous separate election that attempted to turn the temporary division of our country into a permanent one. The Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland proposed twice in 1949 and June 1950 to achieve the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland through general elections in the North and South. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representing the will of the entire Korean people, presented a plan for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland to the South Korean "National Assembly" on June 19, 1950.

　　Despite this, American imperialism, which had been frantically attempting to launch a Korean civil war to make Koreans slaughter each other, directly dispatched Dulles to South Korea in June and instigated the Syngman Rhee gang to suddenly launch a war against the area north of the 38th parallel in June 1950. Two days later, American imperialism sent the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, armed aggression against China's territory Taiwan.

　　Therefore, our people had to suspend the democratic construction undertaken in North Korea after being liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism with the help of the Soviet army, and unanimously rose up to conduct the Fatherland Liberation War to resist the enemy and defend the freedom and independence of their Fatherland.

　　During this just and great Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean people and their armed forces, the Korean People's Army, resolutely supported the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, and joined hands with the fraternal Chinese people, who raised the banner of proletarian internationalism and sent the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers composed of their outstanding sons and daughters during our most difficult times, and with the continuous support and solidarity of the people of the socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, severely attacked the American imperialist aggressors who boasted of being the "strongest in the world," won a glorious victory, and defended our precious Fatherland – the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – from the armed invasion of imperialism.

　　In those three years, in order to overthrow our young republic, American imperialism mobilized two million and several hundred thousand troops from the United States and its vassal states, and even used bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, poison gas and high-explosive bombs in violation of human morality, wantonly massacred more than two million innocent peaceful residents with unprecedented bestial atrocities in human history, and forcibly dragged millions of residents to South Korea; at the same time, it burned and destroyed more than 8,700 factories and enterprise buildings, 28 million square meters, and 6 million households of housing. In addition, through indiscriminate bombing, it left 370,000 cho of farmland desolate and reduced 39,000 cho of land; it destroyed and looted more than 5,000 schools, more than 1,000 hospitals and clinics, more than 260 theaters and cinemas, and several thousand other cultural and welfare facilities.

　　During the Korean War, American imperialism attempted to subdue the Korean people by inhumane methods of execution, but instead spent $20 billion in military expenses and 73 million tons of military supplies, with more than 1.09 million casualties (including more than 380,000 American soldiers), and was finally driven back to the south of the 38th parallel. The armistice negotiations, which had dragged on for two years, finally reached an agreement due to the unremitting efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides for peace, and American imperialism had to sign the armistice agreement.

　　After the armistice, in the face of the heavy difficulties of war-torn devastation, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government began the Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the post-war people's economy, organizing and mobilizing all the people to invest in the creative labor struggle of rapidly restoring and developing the devastated people's economy.

　　In this arduous struggle, the Korean people received the Soviet Union's gratuitous assistance of 1 billion rubles and the People's Republic of China's gratuitous assistance of 800 million yuan, as well as the huge economic and technical assistance given by the people of other fraternal people's democratic countries in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and were encouraged by this, overcame all difficulties, and successfully completed the Three-Year Plan of 1954-1956, basically restoring the war wounds of our people's economy, making the people's economy far exceed the pre-war level.

　　Marking a new development in our people's economy, the First Five-Year Plan, which has the task of basically solving the problems of food, clothing and housing for our people, stipulates that in terms of industry, the production of means of production will increase by 1.9 times; the production of consumer goods will increase by 1.2 times; the total value of industrial output will increase by an average of 21.5% per year, an increase of 1.6 times. By 1961, pig iron production will reach 700,000 tons, steel production will reach 670,000 tons, power generation will reach 9.7 billion kWh, coal production will reach more than 10 million tons, chemical fertilizer production will reach 630,000 tons, cement production will reach 2 million tons, textile production will reach an average of more than 20 meters per person, and the total catch of fish will reach 650,000 tons.

　　In terms of agriculture, by 1961, the total harvest of grain will reach 3.76 million tons, cotton production will reach 30,000 tons, and the total harvest of fruit will reach 150,000 tons.

　　The realization of the First Five-Year Plan with this kind of prospect will transform our country from a backward agricultural country into a self-reliant industrial and agricultural country, making great progress in the socialist north.

　　However, the situation of the people in the southern half today is completely the opposite. Due to the crazy expansion of armaments and the construction and expansion of military facilities by the United States in South Korea, the South Korean economy has been reorganized into a subordinate, military economic system.

　　The proportion of direct military expenditure in the South Korean puppet government's budget was 66.4% in the 1955 fiscal year; with 1953 as the base, it increased to 2.6 times in 1957.

　　Therefore, the puppet government's budget has a huge deficit every year, and last year's deficit reached 54 billion won, which is equal to 226% of 1953. Last year, the taxes borne by small and medium-sized enterprises were equal to more than 160% of 1956, so South Korean enterprises could not even maintain simple reproduction. In 1956, 1,176 factories went bankrupt and closed down, while only 20% of small businesses started operations last year. At present, there are 3.8 million completely unemployed people in South Korea, while the taxes of the South Korean people have increased sharply to 4.1 times that of 1953. In addition, in order to expand military bases and military equipment, they have also plundered 100,000 cho of land from South Korean farmers. Every year, more than 200,000 young people are conscripted into the army, and the South Korean people have to bear more than 50 kinds of taxes. Because of this, South Korea has become a famine zone that must import 6 to 7 million stones of grain every year.

　　Obviously, the tragic scene in South Korea today is the result of the US military's occupation of South Korea.

　　American imperialism's barbaric atrocities against the Korean people are not limited to the above. American imperialists massacred more than 93,000 innocent Korean people before the war; massacred at least more than 2 million people during the war; and from the armistice to April of this year, according to South Korean newspapers alone, there have been more than 200 incidents of American military atrocities.

　　The insults of American imperialism to the Korean people and the barbaric atrocities of the American military are increasing day by day. They openly act as robbers in broad daylight, wantonly massacre and beat innocent children and women, and attack villages and cities to plunder property.

　　The struggle of the South Korean people against the colonial plundering of the American imperialist aggressors and their contempt for the Korean nation, against the tyranny and exploitation of the Syngman Rhee gang, for survival and freedom, for democratic rights, and for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland, is rising day by day.

　　The Korean Armistice Agreement must be strictly observed, the armistice should be transformed into a solid peace, and the American imperialist aggressor troops must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible. However, only about ten days after the armistice, American imperialism signed the "Korean-American Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee gang on August 8, 1953, completely seizing control of the puppet army and creating an excuse for "legalizing" its occupation of South Korea.

　　They have also carried out provocative violations on the military demarcation line, and by May 31, 1957, there were 554 cases pointed out in the Military Armistice Commission alone. In addition, they have repeatedly sent spies and special agents to invade the northern half of the Republic to carry out sabotage and assassination work, and to kidnap peaceful residents.

　　In order to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, American imperialism also instructed the Syngman Rhee gang to unilaterally suspend the legitimate activities of the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the South Korean region in June 1956. American imperialism has also expanded the Syngman Rhee gang from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to twenty-one active divisions, totaling 720,000 people, and established ten "reserve divisions," arming them with American weapons.

　　On the other hand, it has also built and expanded military bases and airfields for the American and Rhee gangs in various parts of South Korea, and even sent large air squadrons equipped with F-100 jet fighters and atomic bombs to South Korea. On June 21, 1957, it unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which prohibits the illegal import of combat weapons; on July 1, it moved the notorious "United Nations Command" to Seoul, and then on October 15, it transferred the US First Cavalry Division from Japan to South Korea, and merged it with the US 24th Division, along with the US 7th Division, into "atomic divisions."

　　In January of this year, it conducted a provocative "atomic assault exercise"; on the 29th of the same month, it transported 280-millimeter atomic artillery pieces into South Korea, and then transported "Honest John" rockets from Japan into South Korea.

　　The crimes committed by American imperialism in turning South Korea into an "outpost assault base" for aggression against the mainland are not limited to these, but the above facts alone are enough to make people fully understand the magnitude of the conspiracy contained in the war preparations carried out by American imperialism in South Korea.

　　These provocative acts by the American imperialist aggressors in Korea that threaten peace must be stopped unconditionally, and all foreign troops headed by the United States military must immediately get out of South Korea.

　　As everyone knows, the statement of our government on February 5 and the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on February 7 regarding this statement are the most reasonable and correct plan that is practical and feasible for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the maintenance of peace in the Far East.

　　Precisely for this reason, the statements of the Korean and Chinese governments have aroused strong support and solidarity from the people of the world. The past four months have shown that the proactive measures taken by the two governments are wise and correct.

　　The Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to withdraw completely from Korea in batches within this year, and have already completed the first phase of the troop withdrawal. This is a decisive measure to open up a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

　　Fair-minded public opinion around the world, along with the Korean people, strongly demands that the United States and all other countries participating in the so-called "United Nations forces" also withdraw their aggressor troops from South Korea like the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　Faced with the serious fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers are withdrawing troops, today the American imperialism and the aggressor troops of other countries participating in the "United Nations forces" have no reason and no basis to remain on the land of South Korea.

　　At present, the most important and most urgent issue in resolving the Korean question is the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

　　However, as pointed out in the replies of the Korean and Chinese governments to the governments of the US imperialism and all other countries participating in the "United Nations forces" on May 6: The US imperialism and all other countries participating in the "United Nations forces" have not only failed to take any positive measures regarding the issue of withdrawing aggressor troops from South Korea to this day, but have instead requested so-called "clarification" on the issue of supervising elections through the British government on April 9. This can only further expose the sinister intentions of the American imperialist aggressors. However, no conspiracy or trick can ever legalize the continued occupation of South Korea by the US aggressor troops.

　　If there had been no American interference in Korea, the reunification of Korea would have been achieved long ago. Therefore, all the Korean people, with an unwavering belief, are determined to make the American imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible, and are determined to peacefully reunify the Fatherland.

　　No conspiracy or instigation by American imperialism can suppress the Korean people's will to fight for the peaceful reunification of their Fatherland, or stop the international trend towards the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

　　The Korean people, because they clearly know the aggressive nature of American imperialism through their own history, resolutely and thoroughly reject the attitude of modern revisionists who beg for the crumbs of American imperialist dollars, flatter and depend on American imperialism.

　　The Korean people, because they clearly realize how brilliant the results of their political and moral unity with the fraternal Chinese people have been in the struggle against American imperialist aggression, are all the more determined to safeguard the friendship and unity among the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union like the pupils of their eyes, and to further strengthen their ties with the people of all countries who are launching anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles, and to fight to the end to make the American imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea and to strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea!

    “六·二五”——朝鲜人民抗美斗争日
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华特命全权大使　李永镐
    八年前的今天，美帝国主义为了奴役我们祖国和我国人民，发动了野蛮的侵略战争，并且把我国人民置于战争残祸之中达三年之久。今天，全体朝鲜人民怀着无比的民族激愤迎接“六·二五”八周年。我们要向全世界揭露和痛斥美帝国主义在朝鲜实行的民族分裂政策和令人发指的野兽暴行，并且下定决心，不实现自己祖国的和平统一，决不罢休。
    美帝国主义为了扼杀朝鲜人民的自由和独立，从它插足朝鲜的第一天起，就走上了露骨的犯罪道路。1945年8月，日本法西斯军队在朝鲜被苏联军队粉碎以后，美帝国主义侵略军队没费一枪一弹，9月里就登陆南朝鲜，并且马上实行军事统治，镇压并解散了朝鲜人民根据自己的自由意志组织起来的人民政权，镇压了民主政党、人民团体和民主人士。美帝国主义一面疯狂地指使亲日派民族叛徒、恶霸地主在它的卵翼下组织所谓国防警备队、海岸警备队和傀儡军，一面疯狂地在南朝鲜建立军事基地。
    1945年12月关于将来要在朝鲜建立临时民主政府的莫斯科三外长会议决议签字以后，美帝国主义为了破坏这个有它自己政府签字的决议，就指使它的忠实走狗李承晚，积极开展反对这个决议的运动，公开把拥护莫斯科三外长会议的政党、人民团体人士和人民关进监狱，非法镇压人民力量，并且不顾朝鲜人民的反对，用枪刀庇护亲日派民族叛徒和亲美派，在1948年5月10日进行了南朝鲜单独选举，又在同年8月非法制造了南朝鲜傀儡政府。同月24日，签订了“韩美临时军事协定”，在1949年底以前把傀儡军增加到八个师；1950年1月，签订了“韩美军事援助协定”和“顾问团协定”，完全掌握了傀儡军的统辖权。此后，又在1950年4月到5月期间，把傀儡军集结到三八线一带，进一步制造挑衅事件，伺机进行侵略。
    面临着这样的民族危机，朝鲜人民掀起了全民性的斗争，反对企图把我国的临时性分裂变为永久性分裂的“五·十”亡国单独选举。祖国统一民主主义战线在1949年和1950年6月先后两次提出通过南北普选实现祖国和平统一的建议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会更在1950年6月19日代表全体朝鲜人民的意志，向南朝鲜“国会”提出了和平统一祖国的方案。
    尽管如此，一直疯狂地企图发动朝鲜内战使朝鲜民族互相残杀的美帝国主义，却在6月直接派遣杜勒斯到南朝鲜，唆使李承晚匪帮在1950年6月突然向三八线以北地区发动了战争。两天以后，美帝国主义并且把第七舰队派往台湾海峡，武装侵略中国的领土台湾。
    因此，我国人民不得不中止由于苏联军队的帮助从日本帝国主义殖民统治桎梏下获得解放以后在北朝鲜进行的民主建设事业，而一致奋起进行祖国解放战争，抗击仇敌，保卫自己祖国的自由和独立。
    在这一正义的、伟大的祖国解放战争期间，朝鲜人民和自己的武装力量朝鲜人民军坚决拥护以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的英明领导，同兄弟的中国人民在我们最艰苦的时期高举无产阶级国际主义抗美援朝的旗帜派遣的、由自己优秀的儿女组成的英雄的中国人民志愿军并肩携手，在以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的不断支持和声援下，沉重地打击了自我吹嘘为“世界最强”的美帝国主义侵略者，取得了光荣的胜利，从帝国主义的武装进犯下捍卫了我们宝贵的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    三年当中，美帝国主义为了推翻我们年青的共和国，动员了二百几十万美国及其仆从国家的军队，甚至违反人类道德，使用了细菌武器、化学武器、毒气和烈性炸弹，以人类历史上空前的野兽暴行恣意屠杀了二百多万无辜的和平居民，并且把几百万居民强拉到南朝鲜去；同时，烧毁和破坏了八千七百多座工厂和企业建筑，二千八百万平方公尺、六百万户的住宅。此外，还通过狂轰滥炸，使三十七万町步的农地荒芜，并减少了三点九万町步田地；破坏和掠夺了五千多所学校，一千多所医院和诊疗所，二百六十多座剧院和电影院以及其它几千处文化福利设施。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战争当中，企图用惨无人道的刽子手方法使朝鲜人民屈服，但是它们反而耗费了二百亿美元的军事费用和七千三百万吨的军事物资，死伤一百零九万多人（其中美国兵死伤三十八万多人），并终于被赶回三八线以南。而拖了两年的停战谈判也由于朝中方面对和平的不懈努力终于达成了协议，美帝国主义不得不在停战协定上签了字。
    停战以后，在惨遭战争破坏的重重困难条件下，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府开始了战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划，组织并动员全体人民投入迅速恢复和发展遭受破坏的人民经济这一创造性的劳动斗争中。
    在这一艰苦的斗争中，朝鲜人民得到了苏联十亿卢布的无偿援助和中华人民共和国八亿元的无偿援助以及其它各人民民主兄弟国家人民本着无产阶级国际主义而给予的巨大的经济和技术援助，并为此而受到鼓舞，克服了一切艰难困苦，胜利地完成了1954—1956三年计划，基本上恢复了我国人民经济的战争创伤，使得人民经济大大超过了战前水平。
    标志着我国人民经济的新的发展，负有在基本上解决我国人民衣食住问题这一任务的第一个五年计划规定：工业方面，生产资料生产将增长一点九倍；消费品生产将增长一点二倍；工业生产总值每年将平均增加21.5％，增长一点六倍。到1961年，生铁生产将达到七十万吨，钢生产将达到六十七万吨，发电量将达到九十七亿度，煤炭生产将达到一千万吨以上，化学肥料生产将达到六十三万吨，水泥生产将达到二百万吨，纺织品生产将达到每人平均二十公尺以上，捕渔总量将达到六十五万吨。
    农业方面，到1961年，粮谷总收获量将达到三百七十六万吨，棉花生产将达到三万吨，水果总收获量将达到十五万吨。
    实现具有这种远景的第一个五年计划，将会把我国由落后的农业国变成自立的工农业国家，使得北半部的社会主义取得巨大的进展。
    但是，今天南半部人民的处境却完全相反。由于美国在南朝鲜疯狂地扩充军备，新建和扩大军事设施，因此南朝鲜经济业已被改编成为隶属性的、军事性的经济体系。
    南朝鲜傀儡政府预算中，直接军事费所占的比重1955会计年度为66.4％；以1953年为基数，1957年则增加为二点六倍。
    因此，傀儡政府的预算，每年都有庞大的赤字，去年的赤字即达五百四十亿圜，等于1953年的226％。去年，中小企业负担的税款等于1956年的160％以上，因此南朝鲜的企业连单纯再生产都维持不住。1956年有一千一百七十六座工厂破产倒闭了，而去年小企业开工的不过20％。现在南朝鲜有三百八十万完全失业者，而南朝鲜人民的赋税却急遽增加为1953年的四点一倍。此外，为了扩大军事基地和军事设备，它们还掠夺了南朝鲜农民十万町步土地。每年有二十多万青年被抓去当兵，南朝鲜人民还要负担五十多种税。正因为这样，南朝鲜已经变成了每年必须进口六、七百万石粮食的饥馑地带。
    显然，今天南朝鲜的这种凄惨景象，正是美军强占南朝鲜的后果。
    美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的野蛮暴行不止上述这一些。美帝国主义者在战前屠杀了无辜的朝鲜人民九万三千多人；在战争期间至少屠杀了二百万人以上；从停战到今年4月，只根据南朝鲜报刊报道，就发生了二百多件美军暴行事件。
    美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的侮辱和美军的野蛮暴行正在日益加剧，他们在光天化日之下公开做了强盗，恣意屠杀和打死天真的儿童和妇女，袭击村庄和城市掠夺财物。
    南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的这种殖民地掠夺和对朝鲜民族的卑视，反对李承晚匪帮的暴压和榨取，争取生存和自由，争取民主权利，以及争取祖国的和平统一的斗争，正在日益高涨。
    朝鲜停战协定必须严格遵守，停战应当转变为巩固的和平，美帝国主义侵略军队必须早日撤出南朝鲜。然而，停战还不过十天左右，美帝国主义就在1953年8月8日同李承晚匪帮签订了“韩美共同防御条约”，完全掌握了傀儡军的统率权，为霸占南朝鲜“合法化”制造了借口。
    它们还在军事分界线上进行了挑衅性的侵犯，到1957年5月31日为止，只是在军事停战委员会上指出的就达五百五十四件。此外，它们还接二连三地派遣间谍和特务分子侵入共和国北半部，进行破坏和暗害工作，拉走了和平居民。
    为了破坏中立国监察委员会，美帝国主义还指使李承晚匪帮在1956年6月片面停止了中立国监察委员会视察小组在南朝鲜地区的合法活动。美帝国主义还把李承晚匪帮从停战当时的十六个师扩大到二十一个现役师共七十二万人，并建立了十个“后备师”，用美国武器把它们武装起来。
    另一方面，还在南朝鲜各地新建和扩建了军事基地和美李匪帮的飞机场，甚至把配备有F—100型喷气机和原子弹的大型飞行队开到南朝鲜。1957年6月21日，又片面宣布废除朝鲜停战协定第十三款关于禁止非法运入作战武器的条款；7月1日即将臭名昭彰的“联合国军司令部”迁到汉城，接着又在10月15日把美军第一骑兵师从日本调到南朝鲜，并把它和美军二十四师混编在一起，同美军第七师一道改编为“原子师”。
    今年1月，进行了挑衅性的“原子突击演习”；同月29日又把二百八十毫米口径的原子炮运入南朝鲜，接着从日本把“诚实的约翰”式火箭运入南朝鲜。
    美帝国主义为了把南朝鲜变为侵略大陆的“前哨突击基地”而犯下的罪行，虽然并不仅仅是这一些，然而只是上述事实就能充分使人了解美帝国主义在南朝鲜所进行的战争准备，包含着多么大的阴谋。
    美帝国主义侵略者在朝鲜威胁和平的这种挑衅行为必须无条件地停止，以美国军队为首的一切外国军队必须立即滚出南朝鲜。
    大家知道，我国政府2月5日的声明和中华人民共和国政府2月7日关于这一声明的声明，是和平解决朝鲜问题、维护远东和平的切实可行的最合理、最正确的方案。
    正因为如此，朝中两国政府的声明引起了全世界人民强有力的支持和声援。过去的四个月说明了两国政府所采取的主动措施是英明的、正确的。
    中国人民志愿军已经决定在今年之内分批全部撤出朝鲜，并且已经结束了第一阶段的撤兵工作。这是打开和平解决朝鲜问题新局面的决定性的措施。
    全世界公正的舆论同朝鲜人民一道强烈主张美国和参加所谓“联合国军”的其它一切国家也要像中国人民志愿军一样把自己的侵略军队撤出南朝鲜。
    面对着中国人民志愿军正在撤兵这一严肃的事实，今天美帝国主义和参加“联合国军”的其它国家的侵略军队没有任何理由也没有任何根据再留在南朝鲜土地上了。
    目前，在解决朝鲜问题方面，最首要也是最迫切的问题是美军撤出南朝鲜。
    但是，正像5月6日朝中两国政府在给美帝国主义和参加“联合国军”的其它一切国家政府的复照中所指出的：美帝国主义和参加“联合国军”的其它一切国家，直到今天，对于从南朝鲜撤出侵略军队问题，不仅没有采取任何积极措施，反而在4月9日通过英国政府要求对监督选举问题进行所谓“澄清”。这只有更加暴露美帝国主义侵略者居心叵测。然而，任何阴谋诡计也绝对不能够使美国侵略军继续霸占南朝鲜合法化。
    如果没有美国干涉朝鲜，朝鲜的统一早就会实现。因此，全体朝鲜人民怀着坚定不移的信念，决心一定要使美帝国主义侵略军早日撤出南朝鲜，一定要和平统一祖国。
    美帝国主义的任何阴谋和策动也抑止不住朝鲜人民争取自己祖国和平统一的斗争意志，阻挡不住国际上和平解决朝鲜问题的趋势。
    朝鲜人民由于通过自己的历史清楚地知道美帝国主义的侵略本质，因此坚决彻底地反击乞食美帝国主义美元牙慧、谄媚和依附美帝国主义的现代修正主义者的态度。
    朝鲜人民由于清楚地认识到，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，自己同兄弟的中国人民在政治和道义上的团结业已获得了多么辉煌的成果，因此更加以充沛的战斗意志，像保卫自己的眼珠一样保卫以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家之间的友好和团结，进一步加强同掀起反帝反殖民主义斗争的各国人民的联系，为使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，为争取朝鲜的和平统一而斗争到底！
