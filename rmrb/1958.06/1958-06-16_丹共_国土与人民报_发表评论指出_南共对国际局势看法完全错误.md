Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: The Danish Communist Party's newspaper "Land and People's Newspaper" published a commentary on May 20 criticizing the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The commentary pointed out: The criticism of the LCY program "concerns profound political issues of great significance to the entire working class." The commentary wrote: The LCY has adopted completely wrong viewpoints in some extremely important aspects. For example, their views on the international situation and the struggle for peace.

The commentary said: Judging from all the materials of the LCY congress, the LCY has not yet started from such a basic view that the most important symbol of our era is the existence of two opposing social systems, and the entire development process actually depends on the outcome of the competition between the two systems. The commentary then wrote: It is no accident that the LCY has not made the same assessment of the development of the world situation as other communist parties have unanimously agreed upon. According to Yugoslavia's opinion, the reasons for the establishment of military blocs should be found in the "erroneous foreign policy" of the Soviet Union during and after the war.

The commentary continued: "The Yugoslav side seems unwilling to see that after the Second World War, when they still had a monopoly on the atomic bomb and thought they could continue to monopolize it for a while, American imperialism hurriedly put away Roosevelt's policy and announced an undisguised expansionist line demanding world hegemony." The commentary wrote: The LCY also failed to notice that these aggressive imperialist forces have led the world to the edge of the abyss more than once in their efforts to implement their policies. The establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an integral part of the Western imperialists' war policy.

The commentary pointed out: "Attempts to cover up the actual situation regarding the establishment of military blocs are of no benefit. First of all, when the military blocs of capitalist countries are already a fact, the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union believed that it was necessary to conclude the Warsaw Pact for their own interests, and also for the interests of all peace-loving people, and there was no other way. The experience of the two world wars should make every communist and socialist understand that in order to save mankind from a new and terrible war, it is not enough to just hope for peace. The forces of peace must maintain their strong position so that the aggressors, fearing the consequences that their own criminal policies will bring them, dare not 'press the button'."

The commentary said: "The unity of the socialist camp and the communist parties in opposing the aggressive forces of imperialism should not be bargained in any case. The conditions for guaranteeing peace and the continuous development and strengthening of the position of socialism remain to strengthen the unity between all socialist countries on the basis of the principle of socialist internationalism, and to resolutely maintain the unity and fraternal cooperation between the communist parties on the basis of the political foundation of Marxism-Leninism."

### 丹共“国土与人民报”发表评论指出  南共对国际局势看法完全错误

    丹共“国土与人民报”发表评论指出
    南共对国际局势看法完全错误
    新华社12日讯　丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”5月20日发表评论，批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领。
    评论指出：对南共纲领的批判“是有关对整个工人阶级具有重大意义的深远的政治问题”。评论写道：南共在一些极其重要的方面，采取了完全错误的观点。例如他们对国际局势和对争取和平的斗争的看法。
    评论说：从南共代表大会目前所有的材料看来，南共还没有从这样一个基本看法出发，即认为我们时代的最重要的标志是两个对立的社会制度的存在，整个发展的进程实际上取决于两个制度竞赛的结果。这篇评论接着写道：对于世界局势的发展，南共没有作出与其他共产主义政党一致同意的相同的估计，这并不是偶然的。根据南斯拉夫的意见，造成建立军事集团的原因，应当从苏联在战时及战后的“错误的外交政策”中去寻找。
    评论接着说：“南斯拉夫方面好像不愿看到，美帝国主义在第二次世界大战后，在他们还掌握着原子弹的垄断，并且认为可以继续垄断一时的时候，就匆匆地收拾起了罗斯福的政策，宣布了明目张胆的要求取得世界霸权的扩张路线”。评论写道：南共也没有注意到，这些侵略的帝国主义势力在力图实现他们的政策时，曾不止一次地把世界引向深渊的边缘。北大西洋公约组织的建立是西方帝国主义者战争政策的一环。
    评论指出：“掩盖关于军事集团建立的实际情况的企图是没有任何好处的。首先，当资本主义国家的军事集团已经是一个事实的时候，以苏联为首的社会主义国家才为了自己的利益，同时也是为了所有爱好和平的人民的利益，认为缔结华沙条约是必要的，除此而外没有其他任何办法。两次世界大战的经验应该使每一个共产主义者和社会主义者懂得，为了使人类免于新的可怕的战争，仅是希望和平是不够的。和平力量必须保持其强大的地位，使侵略者因为害怕他们自己的罪恶政策会给他们带来后果，而不敢‘按电钮’。”
    评论说：“对于社会主义阵营以及共产主义政党在反对帝国主义侵略势力中的团结，在任何情况下都是不应当讲价钱的。和平得到保证和社会主义的地位不断发展和加强的条件仍然是，在社会主义国际主义原则的基础上加强所有社会主义国家之间的团结，在马列主义的政治基础上坚决保持共产主义政党间的团结和兄弟般的合作。”
