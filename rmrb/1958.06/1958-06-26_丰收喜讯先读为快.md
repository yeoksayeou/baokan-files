    Eager to Read Good News of Harvests First

    The miracle of high wheat yields created by farmers in various regions, as reported in the People's Daily recently, is truly inspiring and joyful news. Whenever I read these reports, I feel an indescribable joy and pleasure, and I always finish reading them in one go. Therefore, I look forward to the arrival of the newspaper every day like waiting for a loved one, and I first check these miracles. Such a rate of increase in production has never existed before, and it was simply impossible in the old society. Only today, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have the working people brought into play the creative spirit of daring to think and daring to act, thus achieving such an unprecedented harvest miracle. These facts more powerfully encourage hundreds of millions of farmers across the country to continue to create even more brilliant achievements and build a new socialist countryside in a faster, better, and more economical way. Therefore, I request the newspaper to continue to report on these harvest achievements with greater coverage.　Liu Yifeng

    丰收喜讯先读为快
    近来人民日报登载的，各地农民创造的小麦丰产奇迹，真是振奋人心的大喜事。当我看这些消息时，心中总是有说不出来的高兴和愉快，总是一口气把它看完。因此我每天像盼亲爱的人一样盼着报纸的到来，先看一下这些奇迹。像这样的增产速度是从来没有的，也是旧社会根本办不到的。只有今天在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，劳动人民发挥了敢想敢干的创造精神，才获得了这样史无前例的丰收奇迹。这些事实更有力地鼓舞全国亿万农民继续创造出更辉煌的成就，多快好省地建设社会主义新农村。因此要求报纸以更大的篇幅继续报道这些丰收成果。　刘一峰
