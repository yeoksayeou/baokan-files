Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: After deeply publicizing the General Line, the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory, without increasing manpower, equipment, or capital, has transformed from a factory solely producing white cloth to one producing a variety of printed fabrics. The original machine repair workshop has also transformed into a medium-sized machine manufacturing factory, self-reliantly manufacturing various new types of machinery needed for the factory to increase product varieties.

During the Rectification Campaign, the class consciousness and revolutionary drive of the factory's workers greatly increased. However, some people, constrained by "the theory of conditions as the sole factor" and "the airs of a large factory," would reach out to the state for personnel, money, and equipment whenever technical innovation and production leaps were mentioned, or they would raise other issues, emphasizing difficulties. They believed that "if we are allocated white cotton, we can only weave white cloth"; "producing diverse printed products is a matter for small factories; large factories can only produce 'mass-produced goods.'"

After hearing the report on the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the members of the factory's Party Committee immediately studied these several ideological obstacles that were hindering the implementation of the General Line. They put forward the slogan "Large factories do small things, small things accumulate into large things, break with conventions, do whatever can be done," as a guideline for mobilizing the masses to implement the General Line. The Party Committee also called on all employees not to be content with the status quo, to adhere to the principle of simultaneously developing coarse and fine yarns and fabrics, simultaneously developing large and small reforms, simultaneously developing new and old machines, and simultaneously developing raw cotton and waste cotton. They should work hard, diligently, and cleverly under the existing conditions, actively expand varieties, improve quantity and quality, manufacture machines themselves, and open waste cotton factories. Many employees debated with those who had a sense of inferiority, using stories and news about "local experts" and "minor intellectuals doing great things" published in the newspapers. They said: "The brain and hands are two treasures. If others can use these two treasures to create inventions, why can't we?"

The workers put words into action. Within ten days, more than a thousand cases of inventions and technical innovations emerged throughout the factory. They have now trial-produced more than forty kinds of printed fabrics, and have trial-spun high-count 102 yarn and colored yarn without spinning machines. After the workers in the machine repair workshop proposed the slogan of transforming the repair workshop into a machine manufacturing factory on the condition of ensuring the completion of repair and assembly tasks, the workload immediately increased several times. The workers told the leading cadres: "Don't worry about us, we have ways! Take on as many manufacturing tasks as you can." After this machine repair workshop was transformed into a textile machine manufacturing factory, the factory could manufacture its own combers, dobby looms, raising machines, and other machines needed for the mass production of printed fabrics and high-count yarns. The waste cotton mill, which had not been established in the past due to the inability to purchase machines, has also started construction because the machine repair workshop is capable of undertaking the manufacture of machines.

In order to fully automate the cleaning work in the fine yarn workshop, they established an automation research institute, which created three automated cleaning tools in five days. The technicians and workers of the second weaving branch combined efforts, and within two weeks created a combined winding, warping, and sizing machine, which does not currently exist in the world, merging the existing winding, warping, and sizing processes into one process. On the basis of technical innovation, the labor efficiency of workers in various trades has generally increased by 20% to 100%. Therefore, it is possible to extract a large number of workers from the existing workforce to organize two branches for three-shift production, so that the daily output of yarn and cloth will be increased by 16% and 20% respectively compared with the present.

### 反对安于现状　放下大厂架子  北京棉纺织厂不增加人力资金，生产多种花布  机修车间变成机器厂，自力制造各种新型设备

    反对安于现状　放下大厂架子
    北京棉纺织厂不增加人力资金，生产多种花布
    机修车间变成机器厂，自力制造各种新型设备
    据新华社18日讯　北京棉纺织联合厂深入宣传总路线后，在不增加人力、设备和资金的条件下，由只生产白布的工厂变为生产多种花布的工厂；原来的机修车间也转变为中型机器制造厂，制造全厂增加产品品种所需要的各种新型机器。
    整风运动中，这个厂的职工阶级觉悟和革命干劲大大提高。但也有一部分人在“唯条件论”和“大厂架子”的束缚下，一提到技术革新和生产跃进，就伸手向国家要人要钱要设备，或者另出题目，强调困难。他们认为“配来白棉花就只能织白布”；“生产多样花色品种的产品是小厂的事，大厂就只能生产‘大路货’”。
    这个厂的党委委员们在听了关于“八大”二次会议的传达后，立即研究了这些不利于贯彻总路线的几种思想障碍。提出了“大厂办小事，小事积大事，打破常规，能搞啥就搞啥”的口号，作为发动群众贯彻执行总路线的方针。党委会还号召全体职工不要安于现状，本着粗细纱布并举，大小改革并举，新老机器并举，原棉和废棉并举的原则，在现有的条件下穷干苦干巧干，积极扩大品种，提高产量质量，自己动手制造机器，开办废棉工厂。许多职工拿着报纸上登载的“土专家”“小知识分子做大事”的故事和消息同有自卑感的人进行争辩。他们说：“脑和手是两件宝，别人能用这两个宝进行创造发明，我们为什么不能？”
    工人们说干就干，在十天内，全厂就涌现出上千个创造发明、技术革新的事例。现在他们已经试制出了四十多种花布，并且在没有精纺机的条件下试纺出一百零二支的高级纱和有色纱。机修车间工人提出在保证完成修配任务的条件下变修配车间为机器制造厂的口号后，工作量立即增加了好几倍。工人们对领导干部说：“你们不要为我们发愁，我们有办法！有多少制造任务尽管接过来。”这个机修车间改为纺织机器制造厂以后，工厂因大批生产花布、高级纱所需的精梳机、格子机、拉绒机等机器都可由本厂自己制造。过去因买不到机器所以没有设立的废棉工场，也因机修车间能够承制机器而开始建厂了。
    为了使细纱车间的清洁工作全部自动化，他们成立了一个自动化研究院，五天内就创制了三项自动化的清洁工具。第二织布分场的技术人员和工人相结合，两周内就创造了目前世界上还没有的络经、整经、浆纱联合机，使现有络经、整经、浆纱三道工序合并成一道工序。在技术革新的基础上，各工种工人的劳动效率普遍提高了20％到100％，因而可以在现有人力中，抽出大批工人组织两个分场进行三班生产，使纱和布的日产量比现在分别提高16％和20％。
