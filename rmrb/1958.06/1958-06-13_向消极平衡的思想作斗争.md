    Struggle Against the Ideology of Passive Equilibrium
    Lin Liang, First Secretary of the CPC Gejiu City Committee, Yunnan Province

    Gejiu City, Yunnan Province, is a tin production base in our country. Since liberation, tin production tasks have been tight. The 1957 output was 3.75 times that of the time of liberation, making it the world's largest tin mine. Over the years, production, geological, and infrastructure work have been successful.

    Encouraged by the Party Central Committee's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and especially after Chairman Mao put forward the call to catch up with the UK in fifteen years, the city's workers were greatly encouraged and their enthusiasm was high. Seeing the active agricultural production and the rapid catching-up of local industry, they felt that the previous achievements were nothing and that large state-owned enterprises must advance at full speed.

    Dare to Boldly Imagine
    This year, the original production tasks were set, and during the Great Leap Forward, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry increased the production task by 6.3%. Under the supervision of the Provincial Party Committee, everyone discussed and increased the production task by another 7.1%. Finally, the city guaranteed that this year's production task would be increased by 26% compared to the original plan.

    The original Five-Year Plan calculated the investment amount. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry proposed to reduce investment by 42% while increasing production tasks. Now it seems that investment can be reduced by another 15%, and output can be increased by another 33%.

    Is it possible to achieve the above ideas? Judging from the recent leaps forward in geology, infrastructure, and other aspects of work, it is entirely possible. In terms of production, the tasks arranged according to the annual output of 20,000 tons have been completed and exceeded from January to April, exceeding the state plan even more. Although the development of tin production in the past was not slow, it has never been as rapidly advanced as it is this year. Why is this possible this year? From the perspective of enterprise management, breaking the ideology of passive equilibrium is an important reason.

    Conservative Ideas Gave Rise to the Ideology of Passive Equilibrium
    The organization that manages tin production in Gejiu City is called Yunnan Tin Corporation. The enterprise is large, there are many production plants and mines, and the problems are complex. Therefore, some comrades see more difficulties and fewer positive aspects in enterprise management, resulting in conservative ideas:

    1. Seeing more unfavorable factors and fewer favorable factors. For example, they emphasize that the changing factors in non-ferrous metal mines are too great, such as the size of the ore body and the high or low grade, which change very quickly. Therefore, the plan must be very conservative. However, they do not see that Gejiu's tin reserves are abundant. As long as we actively look for most of the mineable ore bodies and make adjustments, we can turn unfavorable factors into favorable factors.

    2. Looking at plan numbers more and seeing the role of people less. All production, geological, and infrastructure problems excessively believe in so-called quotas, such as the capacity of mineral processing, smelting, and cableway transportation, and do not believe that the efforts of workers can break through them and greatly improve them.

    3. Looking at problems statically more and seeing less from changes. For example, various recovery rates and actual recovery rates have changed with the improvement of technology, but in the face of facts, they still do not believe that the actual recovery rate and processing volume can be improved simultaneously.

    Due to the above conservative ideas, the ideology of passive equilibrium is generated. When the production links of prospecting, mining, transportation, mineral processing, and smelting are unbalanced, instead of breaking through the weak links to catch up, the production situation of the weak links is used as the standard to balance the entire production. For example, the mines are now backward, and plans have been formulated to accommodate the mines for several years. When production reaches a temporary balance, they try their best to maintain the status quo and are afraid that the leap forward in a certain production link will bring "trouble" and "difficulties" of imbalance. The solution to this imbalance is completely placed on capital construction instead of finding ways from existing production.

    Therefore, the plan formulated is a backward plan, the measures taken do not include the active factors of the masses, and the arrangement of production is the arrangement method that is led by the backward links of production. Therefore, for a long time, it has not been possible to break the ideology of passive equilibrium with a revolutionary spirit and make a big leap forward.

    Leap Forward Should Not Be Hindered by Taking Care of Balance
    In order to encourage everyone to make bold leaps forward, we propose: only talk about leaps forward, not about balance; only allow learning from advanced units, and not allow taking care of balance to hinder leaps forward; each production plant and mine should not be constrained by the company's plan, and each plant and mine can develop freely. Don't think too much about the problems of upper and lower processes, neighbors. The plant or mine that can make the upper, lower, left, and right sides lag behind due to the leap forward is considered to have won, otherwise it is considered to have lost; power can be decentralized, all unreasonable rules and regulations can be broken, as long as the quality and safety are guaranteed, and the tasks are overfulfilled.

    The Enthusiasm of the Masses is Rising
    Look! After letting go of enterprise management and the enthusiasm of the masses rises, how do they treat production?

    The first to propose to break the status quo was the mines, which were determined to change the backward state. In order to solve the problem of production ore volume, in addition to stepping up the work of the prospecting team, they proposed that everyone should prospect and everyone should attack small ore leads. Everyone "finds melons along the vines" to find mineable ore bodies, thus solving the shortage of production ore volume.

    After having the production ore volume, they reasonably reorganized the labor organization, exerted the potential of the groups, and improved the scheduling work and filling work in the pits. After several months of efforts, the ore output in the pits almost doubled. One mine increased from 650 tons per day to 1,100 tons, reaching the planned level for 1961.

    The massive ore output from the pits caused tension in transportation. The transportation capacity of several cableways in the plant and mine has quota regulations. However, they were not willing to show weakness. Cableway workers with several years of experience used experimental methods to continuously improve the cableway's carrying capacity. First, they tried to increase the load of the ore bucket, and second, they tried to shorten the distance between the ore buckets, and then they tried to speed up the wheel speed. Finally, they tried all three together. After the experiment was successful, a cableway with a daily transportation volume of 1,300 tons was increased to 2,050 tons, ensuring safe production.

    After the sudden increase in raw ore, the mineral processing capacity of the concentrator was insufficient. However, there has long been a superstition in the concentrator - that the mineral processing volume and the metal recovery rate are contradictory and cannot be unified. If the processing volume is increased, the metal recovery rate will inevitably decrease, just like people cannot digest if they eat too much. But is this the case in production practice? Many workers believe that this superstition can be broken, but it must be tested. So the factory director, the party secretary, and the workers worked day and night on the production line and held seminars on the spot to compare the shifts with the same production but different effects, and explore experience. After more than half a month of hard work, they succeeded. A concentrator with a daily processing volume of 1,500 tons was increased to 2,400 tons, and the metal recovery rate was not reduced. Another concentrator with a daily processing volume of 500 tons was increased to 850 tons, and the metal recovery rate was increased by 1%. The concentrator workers were overjoyed, and those who originally thought this was impossible were also convinced.

    The smelting capacity of the smelter was sufficient last year, but if the production task is increased this year, the capacity will be insufficient. In the plant-wide debate, some people advocated asking other smelters for help, but were immediately opposed by everyone, who unanimously agreed to solve it themselves. The current problem is to improve efficiency and shorten the smelting time, changing three furnaces of tin smelting per day and night to four furnaces. They also used experimental methods, guarding a furnace day and night. Although they failed several times, they were not discouraged. After a quarter, they finally succeeded in the experiment, which can not only complete this year's tin smelting task, but also greatly improve the technology.

    Achieving a New Balance in the Production Leap Forward
    From raw ore to finished tin, it is in this mutual competition that the leap forward has been achieved. Originally, it was proposed not to talk about balance, but the result of the leap forward was to solve the unbalanced state of prospecting, mining, transportation, mineral processing, and smelting for many years, and to achieve a new balance in the production leap forward. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report: There must be imbalance, and there is no absolute balance. The question is what method to take to balance, and in what direction to balance. To make the imbalance between various production departments balanced, the positive method is to make the backward catch up with the advanced, and the passive method is to make the advanced accommodate the backward. This is absolutely true.

    The balanced state achieved is also temporary. Recently, the production capacity of the concentrator has been improved again, which will force the mines and smelters to make corresponding improvements and further progress. The development of prospecting and mining work is also developing rapidly, and a new unbalanced situation led by a mine may also appear in the future. By moving forward like this, the speed of overall production development will be changed.

    The Enthusiasm of Workers and Cadres Converges
    Why has the atmosphere in the plant and mine changed so much this year? This should be attributed to the rectification campaign last year. The change in the ideological style of the cadres is an important reason.

    After the rectification campaign last year, the relationship between cadres and workers has changed greatly. At the beginning of the great blooming and contending, the workers put forward many criticisms to the cadres, and the cadres also gave answers, but most of them belonged to the issue of attitude and method, and many fundamental issues were not involved, and the workers were dissatisfied, especially the old workers. In the rectification, the work style of all the cadres has changed. They often go to the workshops and visit the workers' homes to talk, exchange opinions, and help the workers solve problems. The workers are more satisfied than before, but there are still opinions, because the cadres have still failed to truly grasp the production situation. After further rectification, a large number of cadres were sent to production, and the cadres in office spent most of their time in the work section groups and engaged in labor, ran "experimental fields," managed, produced, studied, and did political and ideological work at the same time. The production meeting was held on the spot, and rationalization proposals, advanced experiences, and many technical issues were also handled, promoted, and resolved on the spot as much as possible. When leading cadres such as the factory director and the party secretary work on the production line, they follow not only the advanced shifts, but also the backward shifts, not only the day shifts, but also the night shifts. If the production is not done well, everyone will think of a way together. The cadres also participate in the labor competition, and the cadres also have production tasks, which must guarantee quality and quantity. This is completely integrated with the workers. In addition, the cadres promoted the work style of hard work and perseverance, refused to leave the front line with minor injuries, and went to the battlefield with illness, which encouraged and moved the workers. The workers also automatically corrected many shortcomings and actively engaged in production and research on production technology issues. After the cadres seriously participated in production, they gradually found out the bottom line: For example, how much potential does a work section group have? Which of the many rules and regulations are not in line with the needs of the site? How can the workers and technicians of this factory give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in the technological revolution? They gradually became good at using production practice to vividly publicize the central government's instructions to the workers, changing the previous preaching method. The cadres had a bottom line in their hearts, on the one hand, they showed more humility, learning then knowing their own shortcomings, and consulted the masses on matters that they were not sure about. They said: "If you don't know if it will work, let's talk about it first. Should it be done or not, let's argue about it first." On the other hand, they showed boldness, daring to affirm and deny things that they did not dare to do in the past. Their attitude towards many revolutionary measures in this leap forward is firm. The workers said: "The cadres are different now, they correct their mistakes immediately, and they grasp the problems very accurately."

    The enthusiasm of the workers has been improved, the ideas of enterprise management have been liberated, and the ideological style of the cadres has been changed. The enthusiasm of the workers and cadres has converged and unified in production practice, advancing together and firing at the forces that hinder the development of productive forces, and has become an irresistible force.

    向消极平衡的思想作斗争
    中共云南省个旧市委第一书记　林亮
    云南省个旧市是我国的一个产锡基地。自从解放以来，锡的生产任务一直是紧张的，1957年的产量相当于解放时产量的三点七五倍，成为世界最大的锡矿。历年来，生产、地质、基建各方面工作都是有成绩的。
    在中央鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，特别是毛主席提出十五年赶上英国的号召后，全市职工得到很大的鼓舞，情绪沸腾；看到农业生产的活跃，地方工业也在急起直追，认为过去的一点成绩算不得什么，国营大企业必须跑步前进。
    敢于大胆地设想
    今年原定了生产任务，在跃进中冶金部给增加生产任务6.3％，在省委督促之下，大家讨论又增加生产任务7.1％。最后全市保证今年的生产任务比原定计划增加了26％。
    五年计划原计算了投资数，冶金部提出要压缩投资42％，生产任务还要增加，现在看来投资还可以压缩15％，产量可再增加33％。
    以上的设想是否能实现呢？就最近地质、基建各方面工作的跃进情况来看是完全可能的。就生产来说，一至四月份按年产两万吨计划所安排的任务已经完成和超过，较国家计划超过更多了。以往锡的生产的发展虽然不算慢，但是从来没有像今年这样跃进的发展。为什么今年能够如此呢？从管理企业上来说，打破消极平衡思想是一个重要原因。
    保守观念产生了消极平衡思想
    管理个旧市锡的生产的机构叫做云南锡业公司，企业大了，生产厂矿多了，问题是错综复杂的，因而有些同志在管理企业中看困难多，看积极方面少，产生了保守思想：
    1、看不利因素多，看有利因素少。例如强调有色金属矿山变化因素太大，如矿体的大小，品位的高低变化得都很快，因而做计划要十分保险。但是他们看不到个旧锡的蕴藏丰富，只要积极寻找多数可采的矿体，加以调整安排，便可以化不利因素为有利因素。
    2、看计划数字多一些，看人的作用少一些。一切生产、地质、基建的问题都是过分相信所谓定额，如选矿、冶炼的能力，索道运输能力等，不相信职工努力能够打破它，并且能大量提高。
    3、静止地看问题多一些，从变化中看得少一些。例如各项回采率、实收率已经随着技术提高而发生变化，但是在事实面前还是不相信实收率与处理量可以同时提高。
    由于以上的保守观念，便产生了消极平衡思想。当探矿、采矿、运输、选矿、冶炼等生产环节不平衡的时候，不是突破薄弱环节跟上去，而是以薄弱环节生产情况为标准，来平衡全部生产。例如现在矿山落后，几年来都是迁就矿山制定计划。当生产达到暂时平衡的时候，又极力维持现状害怕某一个生产环节跃进，带来不平衡的“麻烦”与“困难”。把这种不平衡状况的解决完全寄托于基本建设上，而不从现有生产中想办法。
    因此，制定的计划是一个落后的计划，采取的措施，是不包括群众积极因素在内的措施，安排生产是被生产落后环节牵着鼻子走的安排法。所以长期以来就不能以革命精神打破消极平衡思想来一个大的跃进。
    不许因照顾平衡而妨害跃进
    为了鼓励大家大胆跃进，我们提出：只讲跃进，不讲平衡；只许向先进单位看齐，不许因照顾平衡而妨害跃进，各个生产厂矿不要受公司的计划的约束，各个厂矿可以自由发展，不要多考虑上下工序左邻右舍的问题，那个厂矿能够因跃进而使上下左右都落后了就算赢，反之算输；权力可以下放，一切不合理的规章制度可以打破，只要能保证质量、安全，超额完成任务就行。
    群众的劲头起来了
    看吧！管理企业放手，群众的劲头起来之后，他们是如何对待生产的。
    首先提出要打破现状的是矿山，它们决心要改变落后状态。为了解决生产矿量问题，除了加紧探矿组的工作外，他们提出人人探矿，人人向小矿引子进攻，大家“沿藤找瓜”，寻找可采矿体，因而解决了生产矿量的不足。
    有了生产矿量之后，他们合理的改组了劳动组织，发挥小组潜力，改善了坑下调度工作与充填工作。经过几个月努力，坑下出矿几乎增加一倍，一个矿山由日出六百五十吨提高到一千一百吨，达到了1961年的计划水平。
    坑下大量出矿之后，引起了运输的紧张。厂矿几条索道的运输能力都有定额的规定。但是他们不甘示弱，有了几年经验的索道工人用试验的方法不断地提高索道运载能力。首先试验加大矿斗的载重，其次试验缩短矿斗与矿斗之间的距离，进而试验加速开动轮的速度，最后将三者一齐试验，试验成功后，一条每日运量为一千三百吨的索道提高为二千零五十吨，并且保证了安全生产。
    原矿突然增加之后，选矿厂的选矿能力不够了。可是在选矿厂却又长期存在着一个迷信——就是选矿处理量与金属实收率是对抗性的矛盾，不能统一，若是加大了处理量，就必然使得金属实收率下降，好比人吃多了就不能消化是一样的。但是在生产实践中是不是这样呢？许多工人认为这个迷信是可以打破的，但是要经过试验。于是厂长、党委书记和工人一起，日夜跟班生产，在现场开研究会，将生产相同而效果不同的班与班之间进行比较，摸索经验，经过半个多月的苦战之后成功了。一个每日处理量为一千五百吨的选矿厂提高到二千四百吨，而金属实收率并未降低。另外一个每日处理量为五百吨的选矿厂提高到八百五十吨，而金属实收率反而能增加1％。选矿厂职工欢欣鼓舞，原来认为这是不可能的事的人也心服口服了。
    冶炼厂的能力去年有余，今年若是生产任务增加，则能力不足。在全厂职工的大辩论中，有人主张请其他炼厂帮忙，当即遭到大家的反对，一致愿意自己解决。当前问题是要提高效率，缩短冶炼时间，将一昼夜炼锡三炉改为四炉。它们同样以试验方法，守着一个炉子日夜不离，虽然几次失败但并不灰心，经过一个季度终于试验成功，既能够完成今年炼锡任务，又在技术上大大提高一步。
    在生产跃进中达到新平衡
    从原矿到精锡出厂就是在这样互相争长中跃进起来的，原先提出是不讲平衡，而跃进的结果是解决了多年探、采、运、选、炼的不平衡状态，在生产跃进中达到了新的平衡。诚如少奇同志报告所指出的：不平衡一定是会有的，绝对的平衡是没有的，问题在于采取什么方法去平衡，向什么方向去平衡，要使各生产部门之间不平衡得到平衡，积极的方法是使落后的赶上先进的，消极的方法是使先进的迁就落后的。这是千真万确的。
    达到的平衡状态也是暂时的。最近，选矿厂的生产能力又提高了，这将迫使矿山与炼厂要作相适应的提高与更加前进。探采工作的发展也有一日千里之势，将来也可能出现一个矿山带头的新的不平衡的局面。如此前进不已，就将整个生产发展的速度改观了。
    工人和干部的积极性汇合起来
    厂矿的风气为什么今年能够如此大变呢？这应该归功于去年的整风，干部思想作风的转变是重要的原因。
    去年整风之后，干部与工人的关系有很大的变化。在大鸣大放开始时，工人向干部提出很多批评，干部也作了答复，但是多数是属于态度方式问题，许多根本性问题没有涉及，工人是不满意的，特别是老工人。在整改中所有的干部的作风都有转变，经常下车间及到工人家中访问谈心，交换意见，帮助工人解决问题，工人是比以前满意了，但是还有意见，就是因为干部仍然未能真正切实掌握生产情况。经过进一步整风之后，大批干部下放生产，在职干部以大部分时间在工段小组并从事劳动，办“试验田”，边管理，边生产，边学习，边做政治思想工作。把生产会议放在现场，把合理化建议、先进经验，许多技术问题，也尽可能在现场处理、推广与解决。厂长党委书记等领导干部跟班劳动时，既跟先进的班，也跟落后的班，既跟日班，也跟夜班，生产搞不好，大家一起想办法，干部也参加劳动竞赛，干部也同样有生产任务，既要保质还要保量。这就与工人完全打成一片。加上干部发扬了勤劳艰苦的作风，轻伤不下火线，带病赴战场，鼓舞和感动了工人，工人也自动改正许多缺点，积极从事生产与钻研生产技术问题。干部认真参加生产之后，也逐渐摸到了底：例如一个工段小组究竟有多大潜力？许多规章制度那些是不切合现场需要？本厂工人与技术人员在技术革命中如何发挥其积极性与创造性？逐渐善于通过生产实践，生动地向工人宣传中央的指示，改变了以往的说教式的办法。干部心中有了底，一方面表现更虚心，学然后知不足，没有把握的事即与群众商量。他们说：“不知行不行，先来鸣一鸣，该办不该办，先来辩一辩”。一方面表现大胆，敢于肯定和否定以往不敢做的事。对于这次跃进中许多革命的措施，他们的态度是坚决的。工人说：“现在干部不一样了，有错即改，抓问题抓得很准。”
    工人积极性提高了，管理企业的思想解放了，干部的思想作风转变了，工人与干部的积极性汇合起来，统一在生产实践中，一齐前进，一齐向束缚生产力的势力开火，就成为一支不可抗拒的力量。
