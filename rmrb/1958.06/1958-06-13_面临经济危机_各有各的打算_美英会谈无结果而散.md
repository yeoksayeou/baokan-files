Facing Economic Crisis, Each Has Their Own Plans
US-UK Talks End Without Result
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 12th: The three-day talks between British Prime Minister Macmillan and US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles ended on the 11th without any joint communique being issued. Macmillan has already left Washington on the same day to visit Ottawa, the capital of Canada.

The news indicates that the leaders of the two governments discussed a wide range of international issues during the three-day talks, with a particular focus on the "economic and financial" difficulties of the capitalist world. No agreement was reached on how to deal with this problem.

While peddling the theory of "economic interdependence," the British Prime Minister expressed great concern about the vigorous development of the socialist countries' economies, demanding "some new economic ideas" to deal with what he called a "threat," in order to "prevent the (Western) military defenses from being surrounded on the economic front," and to extend the "ideals" of the "free world" to "uncommitted countries." On the other hand, the British government's anxious mood regarding the US economic crisis that is impacting the capitalist world is also impossible to completely conceal. Reports in the British bourgeois press indicate that Britain wanted to obtain a so-called "standby loan" from the United States through this negotiation to support the economies of the Commonwealth countries affected by the US reduction in raw material imports, and to gain some leverage for Britain at the Commonwealth Economic Conference to be held this autumn.

However, the three days of talks showed that, although Macmillan displayed "unexpected vigor" in the talks, his negotiating counterparts were not so "vigorous."

News reports indicate that the two countries finally agreed "in principle" to strengthen the "development" of underdeveloped countries, and to this end, they studied the expansion of the scope and capital of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the possible establishment of a credit institution with one billion US dollars. However, it was not possible to "make policy decisions" on this point.

According to reports, further discussions on this issue will be left to experts to conduct later.

The leaders of the two governments also discussed the issue of a summit meeting, disarmament, the cessation of nuclear tests, the situation in France, and other issues.

### 面临经济危机　各有各的打算  美英会谈无结果而散

    面临经济危机　各有各的打算
    美英会谈无结果而散
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：英国首相麦克米伦同美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯举行的为时三天的会谈在11日结束，会谈结束后没有发表任何公报。麦克米伦已经在同一天离开华盛顿到达加拿大首都渥太华访问。
    消息表明，两国政府领导人在三天会谈中讨论了广泛的国际问题，尤其是着重讨论了资本主义世界的“经济和财政”困难问题。在如何处理这个问题上没有取得协议。
    在兜售“在经济上互相依靠”这个理论时，英国首相对社会主义国家经济的蓬勃发展甚表不安，要求采取“某种新的经济方面的想法”来对付他所谓的“威胁”，以“防止（西方的）军事防御在经济战线上受到包围”，要把“自由世界”的“理想”扩大到“未承担义务的国家去”。另一方面英国政府对于正在冲击着资本主义世界的美国经济危机的一片焦急心情，也是无法完全掩饰的。英国资产阶级报纸的报道表明，英国想通过这次谈判，从美国弄到一笔所谓“备用贷款”，以支持因为美国削减原料进口而受到影响的英联邦国家的经济，替英国在今年秋天举行的联邦经济会议上搞点资本。
    但是，三天的会谈表明，尽管麦克米伦在会谈中表现了出乎美国政府人员“意料之外的劲头”，而他的会谈对手却“劲头”不大。
    消息报道表明，两国最后在“原则上”同意要加强“开发”不发达国家，并且为此研究了扩充世界银行和国际货币基金组织的经营范围和资本的问题以及可能成立一个有十亿美元资金的信贷机构的问题。可是，对于这一点并没有能够“作出政策性决定”。
    据报道，关于这个问题的进一步讨论将留待以后由专家们去进行。
    两国政府领导人还讨论了最高级会议问题、裁军问题、停止核试验问题、法国局势以及其他一些问题。
