Conquer wind and sand and bitter cold,
Drill through the Gobi and high mountains,
Let all treasures be utilized for the country,
We want chimneys to stand tall on the sandy beach.
Leaving the Qilian Mountains,
Climbing the Tianshan Mountains,
Urging our horses to catch up with Sichuan,
Quickly find a large oil field.
The continuous high mountains are majestic,
What are eight mountains and seven gullies?
With an iron will, we must open the road,
Heroes raise their pickaxes,
The mountains tremble and the sky wants to hide.

　　柴达木工人之歌
　　战胜风砂严寒，
　　钻透戈壁高山，
　　让万宝为国利用，
　　要烟筒林立沙滩。
　　出祁连，
　　登天山，
　　快马加鞭追四川，
　　迅速找到大油田。
　　连绵高山巍峨峨，
　　八山七沟算什么，
　　志如铁，要通车，
　　英雄举镐，
　　山颤天欲躲。
