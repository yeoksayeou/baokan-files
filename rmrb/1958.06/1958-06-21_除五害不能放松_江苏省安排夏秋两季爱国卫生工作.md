Eliminating the Five Pests Cannot Be Relaxed
Jiangsu Province Arranges Patriotic Health Work for the Summer and Autumn Seasons

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Zhu Xueke reports: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee recently convened a meeting of the persons in charge of the Leading Group Offices for the Elimination of the Five Pests (Four Pests plus Schistosomiasis) Patriotic Health Movement of the Prefectural (City) and County Party Committees. This meeting further implemented the spirit of eliminating the five pests to serve production, and discussed and arranged the work for the summer and autumn seasons in light of the characteristics of agricultural production during these periods.

Since the past winter and spring, the patriotic health movement to eliminate the five pests in Jiangsu Province has achieved tremendous results. According to statistics, by the end of April, the province had eliminated more than 77.9 million rats, more than 69.7 million sparrows, more than 25,900 *jin* of mosquitoes, more than 3.2 million *jin* of flies (pupae), and more than 124 million square meters of snails. More than 2.2 million sewage ditches and ponds were filled in, toilets were universally built and renovated, manure was managed, and more than 125,700 schistosomiasis patients were treated. The incidence of infectious diseases has also decreased significantly. Comparing from January to April this year with the same period last year, typhus decreased by 78.9%, dysentery decreased by 13.3%, and typhoid and paratyphoid decreased by 67.22%.

However, since the start of the busy farming season, some rural work cadres, due to a lack of deep understanding of the purpose of eliminating the five pests to serve production, and a failure to grasp the characteristics of summer agricultural production, exaggerated the difficulties and believed that the five pests could not be eliminated during the busy farming season, setting the elimination of the five pests in opposition to production, and relaxing the work of eliminating the five pests; some people were undecided about whether to eliminate the five pests during the busy farming season, and were also standing still waiting for higher-level task assignments, affecting the development of the movement to eliminate the five pests.

In response to the above problems, the meeting, after affirming the achievements of the health movement in the past winter and spring, adopted the method of first focusing on ideological understanding, then on practical matters, first discussing ideological issues, and then discussing methods and tasks, mobilizing the attendees to discuss their ideological situations and launch discussions. Through discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that production must come first, and the elimination of the five pests must be carried out on the premise of obeying production, combining with production, and ensuring the completion of current production tasks. During the meeting, everyone criticized the erroneous ideas of setting the elimination of the five pests against production, and of engaging in the elimination of the five pests divorced from current production tasks. Many people also reviewed their own erroneous ideas in connection with the discussion. Some people reviewed that their neglect of the elimination of the five pests in favor of production was due to an insufficient understanding of the significance of doing a good job in eliminating the five pests to create conditions for developing production, and therefore, they did not muster enough energy to find ways to overcome various difficulties and persist in eliminating the five pests.

When discussing and arranging the work for the summer and autumn seasons, after everyone lined up the main farm work for the two seasons, they unanimously agreed that although this year's rural work in Jiangsu is very busy, there are still gaps of varying lengths. As long as the Party Committee arranges the elimination of the five pests in a unified manner when arranging the production plans for each season and each stage, and organizes various activities, both intensive and regular, according to different situations, those that can be combined with the current production can be combined, and those that cannot be combined should not be forced to be combined, and full use should be made of the gaps in busy farming to carry out the work, so that the healthy development of the movement to eliminate the five pests is guaranteed without affecting production. The persons in charge of the Leading Group Offices for the Elimination of the Five Pests of the various Prefectural (City) and County Party Committees immediately put forward preliminary plans for the elimination of the five pests in the summer and autumn seasons.

### 除五害不能放松  江苏省安排夏秋两季爱国卫生工作

    除五害不能放松
    江苏省安排夏秋两季爱国卫生工作
    本报讯　记者朱学科报道：中共江苏省委于最近召开地（市）、县委除五害（四害加血吸虫病）爱国卫生运动领导小组办公室负责人会议。这个会议进一步贯彻除五害为生产服务的精神，针对夏秋两季农业生产的特点，讨论安排两季工作。
    去冬今春以来，江苏全省的除五害爱国卫生运动获得了巨大的成绩。据统计，到4月底止，该省共消灭老鼠七千七百九十多万只，麻雀六千九百七十多万只，蚊子二万五千九百多斤，蝇（蛹）三百二十多万斤，钉螺一亿二千四百多万平方公尺，填平污水沟塘二百二十多万条，普遍修建、改建了厕所，对粪便进行了管理，治疗血吸虫病人达十二万五千七百多人。传染病的发病率也有显著的下降，从今年1月到4月份和去年同时期比较，斑疹伤寒下降78.9％，痢疾下降13.3％，伤寒、副伤寒下降67.22％。
    但是从农忙季节开始以来，有部分农村工作干部，因对除五害为生产服务的目的缺乏深刻的认识，没有掌握夏季农业生产的特点，夸大了困难，认为农忙季节不能除五害，把除五害和生产对立起来，放松了除五害工作；有些人对农忙时要不要除五害拿不定主意，也按兵不动地等待上级布置任务，影响除五害运动的开展。
    会议针对以上问题，在肯定了去冬今春卫生运动的成绩以后，即采取先务虚、后务实，先谈思想问题，后谈方法和任务的办法，发动到会的人摆思想情况，展开讨论。通过讨论，大家一致认识到必须生产一马当先，除五害，要在服从生产、结合生产、保证当前生产任务完成的前提下进行。会议中大家批判了把除五害与生产对立起来，以及脱离当前生产任务去搞除五害工作等错误思想。不少人在讨论中还联系检讨了自己的错误思想。有的人检讨自己顾了生产丢了除五害，是由于对搞好除五害为发展生产创造条件的意义认识不足，因之，没有鼓足干劲地去想办法克服多种困难，把除五害坚持下去。
    在讨论安排夏秋两季工作的时候，大家把两季的主要农活进行排队以后，一致认为，今年江苏的农村工作虽然十分繁忙，但仍有长短不等的空隙，只要党委在安排每季和每阶段的生产计划的时候，统一安排除五害的活动，分别情况，组织突击性的和经常性的各种活动，对能和当前各项生产结合的就结合，不能结合的就不勉强结合，充分利用农忙空隙进行工作，这样就以可既不影响生产，又保证了除五害运动的健康发展。各地（市）、县委除五害领导小组办公室负责人当即提出了夏秋两季除五害的初步计划。
