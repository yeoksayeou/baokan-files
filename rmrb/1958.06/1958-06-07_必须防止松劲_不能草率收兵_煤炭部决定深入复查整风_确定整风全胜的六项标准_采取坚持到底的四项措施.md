Xinhua News Agency report: Our reporter Yuan Mu reports: The Ministry of Coal Industry is persisting in carrying the rectification movement through to the end, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In order to prevent complacency and hasty conclusions, the ministry recently proposed six criteria for a successful conclusion to the rectification movement, adopted four organizational measures to ensure the rectification is carried through to the end, and decided to conduct a mass-based, in-depth review of the progress of the entire rectification movement.

Since the documents and resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress were successively published, the Party Group and the Rectification Leadership Group of the Ministry of Coal Industry convened several meetings of directors of various departments, focusing on discussing the issue of carrying the rectification movement through to the end, as mentioned in the third part of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. After repeated discussions, they unanimously agreed that under the circumstance that the "discussion of what is imaginary" has basically ended in this ministry, the current rectification movement must take the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress as the guiding principle. Through the ongoing Red and Expert debate and the personal examination in the fourth stage of rectification, thoroughly discredit bourgeois individualism among all staff, break down superstitions, further emancipate minds, and establish the communist ideological style, so as to better meet the tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. For leading cadres at all levels, it is required to participate in and lead the Red and Expert debate, and to conduct serious personal ideological examinations, focusing on summarizing and examining the ideological methods, the application of socialist democratic methods in the rectification movement, and the working methods of the mass line. The Party Group of the ministry stipulated that such personal examinations by leading cadres, including the minister, must be carried out without exception.

As to how to carry the rectification movement through to the end, the ministry's leading group put forward six specific criteria: First, all cadres, especially leading cadres at or above the level of bureau directors, must have a clear understanding of the general line of socialist construction; and, based on the specific circumstances of each unit, have found specific paths, guidelines, and methods for implementing the general line. On this issue, it is required to make a serious examination and summary of the past erroneous practices and shortcomings that violated the general line in various business policies and specific work, based on the "discussion of what is imaginary" by the masses in the previous stage. Second, all staff, especially leading cadres, must have the courage to break down superstitions and emancipate their minds, and initially establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Third, a new atmosphere of a comprehensive great leap forward must truly emerge in various tasks and in the thinking of cadres in each unit. Fourth, whether a new political situation has been formed or is gradually forming. On this issue, it is first required to revitalize the socialist democratic life of the organization, requiring leading cadres to follow the mass line in everything, and requiring leaders and the masses to use criticism and self-criticism as a weapon to promote various tasks and solve ideological problems of cadres. Fifth, the strength of the left wing must have increased significantly compared to before the rectification movement began, and a team that is both Red and expert must begin to form. Sixth, a serious summary of the experiences of the rectification movement must be made. This summary must have both viewpoints and specific materials, and combine theory with practice; at the same time, it must also be tailored to the specific circumstances of each unit, and propose practical and feasible measures to implement the spirit of the rectification into daily work, especially to propose concrete measures on how to strengthen Party leadership and political and ideological work in various tasks. The method of summarizing the rectification should also implement the mass line and earnestly mobilize the masses to participate in discussions.

In order to ensure that each unit successfully concludes the rectification movement in accordance with the above requirements, the Ministry of Coal Industry has adopted the following four organizational measures: First, the top leader of each unit must take command to the end. There should be no change of personnel unless there are special circumstances. The leading force and working bodies of the rectification movement should not be weakened in the slightest, until the rectification movement is successfully concluded. In addition to concentrating efforts to do a good job in the current Red and Expert debate, they must be responsible to the end, including the review and summary work of the rectification. Second, after the Red and Expert debate is over, immediately organize a review of the progress of the entire rectification movement. For individual dead corners and backward units, earnestly mobilize the masses to make up for the missed lessons. When necessary, manpower can be transferred to help eliminate dead corners and enable backward units to catch up quickly. Third, the top leaders and leading comrades of each unit must personally prepare the summary report of the previous stage of "discussing what is imaginary." This report should be based on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, combined with the specific circumstances of the unit, grasp the key issues, and conduct an in-depth examination of the past work, and propose measures on how to implement the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" in the future. Fourth, the issue of comprehensively summarizing the experiences of the rectification and how to regularize the spirit of the rectification should be quickly put on the agenda. The leading comrades of each unit should currently consider how to implement the spirit of the rectification into daily work, and should organize mass discussions at an appropriate time.

Currently, the Ministry of Coal Industry is both launching the Red and Expert debate in its entirety and the leadership is actively preparing for the rectification review work, so as to quickly carry it out immediately after the Red and Expert debate. The ministry requires that this review be conducted with the personal involvement of leaders, layer-by-layer inspection, and the earnest mobilization of the masses to participate. The review should be conducted from three aspects: people, things, and units. All problems of certain individuals that should have been touched upon but were not touched upon in this rectification movement, things that should have been resolved but were not resolved, and dead corners and backward units whose work and thinking have not fundamentally changed, must be resolutely made up for.

    必须防止松劲　不能草率收兵
    煤炭部决定深入复查整风
    确定整风全胜的六项标准　采取坚持到底的四项措施
    本报讯　记者袁木报道：煤炭工业部正根据中共“八大”二次会议的精神坚持把整风运动进行到底。为了防止松劲情绪和草率收兵的现象，这个部最近提出了如何才算胜利结束整风运动的六项标准，采取了保证把整风进行到底的四项组织措施，并且决定要对全部整风运动的进展情况进行一次群众性的深入复查。
    自从“八大”第二次会议的各项文件和决议陆续发表以后，中共煤炭部党组和整风领导小组召集各司局长开了多次会议，着重讨论了刘少奇同志报告第三部分中有关把整风运动进行到底的问题。经过反复讨论，他们一致认为在这个部“论虚”基本结束的情况下，当前的整风运动必须以“八大”第二次会议的精神为纲，通过正在进行的红专辩论和整风第四阶段的个人检查，在全部工作人员中彻底搞臭资产阶级个人主义，破除迷信，进一步解放思想，树立共产主义的思想风格，以便更好地迎接技术革命和文化革命的任务。对各级领导干部来说，要求通过参加与领导红专辩论，认真进行个人的思想检查，着重在思想方法上以及对整风运动中社会主义民主方式的运用和群众路线的工作方法加以总结检查。部党组规定，领导干部的这种个人检查，包括部长在内无例外都要进行。
    怎样才算把整风运动进行到底，这个部的领导小组提出了六项具体标准：第一、在全体干部中，特别是在司局长以上的领导干部中，已经对社会主义建设总路线都有了明确的认识；根据各单位的具体情况，找到了贯彻总路线的具体道路、方针和方法。在这个问题上，要求一定要做到有破有立，对于过去在各项业务方针和具体工作中违背总路线的错误做法和缺点，要在前阶段群众“务虚”的基础上做出认真的检查和总结。第二、在全体工作人员特别是领导干部中，已经有了敢于破除迷信和解放思想的勇气，初步树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。第三、各单位的各项工作上和干部思想上真正出现了全面大跃进的新气象。第四、新的政治局面是否已经形成或者逐渐形成。在这问题上，首先要求做到活跃机关的社会主义民主生活，要求领导干部事事走群众路线，以及领导和群众能够以批评与自我批评作为推动各项工作和解决干部思想问题的武器。第五、左派的力量比整风运动开始以前有了十分显著的增长，一支又红又专的队伍开始形成。第六、认真地做出了整风运动的经验总结。这个总结必须既有观点又有具体材料，做到理论与实际相结合；同时，还必须针对各单位的具体情况，提出把整风的精神贯彻到日常工作中去的切实可行的措施，特别要提出如何在各项工作中加强党的领导和政治思想工作的具体措施。在进行整风总结的方法上，也要贯彻群众路线，认真地发动群众进行讨论。
    为了保证各单位按照上述要求胜利结束整风运动，煤炭部已经采取了以下四项组织措施：第一、各单位的第一把手必须挂帅到底，没有特殊情况不换班，整风运动的领导力量和办事机构不能有丝毫削弱，直到整风运动胜利结束，除了集中力量搞好当前的红专大辩论外，包括对整风的复查和总结工作，都要负责到底。第二、在红专大辩论结束后，立即组织对全部整风运动的进展情况进行一次复查，对于个别死角和落后单位，要认真发动群众进行补课。必要时可抽调力量帮助消灭死角，使落后单位迅速赶上。第三、各单位第一把手和领导同志要亲自动手，做好前一阶段“务虚”的总结报告。这个报告要根据“八大”第二次会议的精神，联系本单位的具体情况，抓住关键问题对过去的工作进行一次深入检查，并且要提出今后如何贯彻“八大”会议精神的措施。第四、把全面总结整风经验和如何把整风精神经常化的问题迅速提到议事日程上来。各单位的领导同志目前就应该考虑如何把整风精神贯彻到日常工作中去的问题，并且要在适当时机组织群众讨论。
    目前，煤炭部一方面在展开全部范围的红专大辩论，一方面领导上正积极准备整风复查工作，以便紧接红专大辩论后迅速开展起来。这个部要求这次复查要做到领导亲自动手，层层检查，并且要认真发动群众参加。复查要从人、事和单位三个方面进行，凡是在这次整风运动中应该触动而没有触动的某些人的问题，应该解决而没有解决的事，以及工作和思想没有根本转变的死角和落后单位，都必须坚决进行补课。
