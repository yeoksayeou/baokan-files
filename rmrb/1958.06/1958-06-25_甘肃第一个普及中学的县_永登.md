    Yongdeng, Gansu - The First County to Universalize Middle School Education
    Yongdeng County in Gansu Province, with the entire population mobilized to develop education, has now achieved a middle school in every township, becoming the first county in Gansu Province to universalize middle school education.
    In 1949, Yongdeng County only had one junior middle school with 79 students. Many townships couldn't find a single middle school student, making it one of the most culturally backward areas in Gansu Province. In 1956, a public middle school was added, bringing the total number of middle school students to 1,302 including the original one. Many graduates from senior primary schools in the county could not continue their education. During the Great Leap Forward in production, the peasant masses urgently demanded a great transformation in culture. In April, primary school education was universalized. In May, the first county-run university was established. At this time, the masses' enthusiasm for running schools became even higher. All twenty-two townships in the county established thirty-six middle schools of various types, including the mountainous, 7,000-person township of Qishan, which established ten middle schools. When this township established its first agricultural middle school, peasants throughout the township celebrated by raising colorful flags and beating gongs and drums. At the same time, they also donated land, flags, and sheep to the school.
    These middle schools include professional schools specializing in industry, agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, forestry, water conservancy, hygiene, and teacher training. In running the schools, the masses demonstrated a high degree of initiative, readily vacating houses or donating labor and materials to build houses. Some peasants voluntarily fired bricks and lime for the schools. Qingshui Township Agricultural Middle School had no classrooms, so the peasants built thatched sheds themselves. They had no desks or stools, so the peasants replaced them with mud platforms. The establishment of these middle schools did not cost the state a single penny, and the peasants themselves did not spend much money.
    In order to solve the problem of teachers for the people-run middle schools, the Yongdeng County People's Committee also selected 24 graduates of secondary normal schools and senior high schools from among the county's more than 900 primary school teachers, gave them short-term intensive training, and then assigned them to various middle schools as full-time teachers to teach cultural subjects such as language and mathematics. At the same time, outstanding commune members, doctors, cadres who graduated from professional technical schools, and technicians from factories, coal mines, and geological teams were hired as part-time teachers to teach technical courses. The general branch secretaries of each township served as political instructors. For textbooks, general middle school textbooks are temporarily used for cultural courses, and technical teachers compile teaching materials to teach technical theory in conjunction with practical training.
    These schools generally graduate in two years and practice a half-work, half-study system. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 甘肃第一个普及中学的县——永登

    甘肃第一个普及中学的县——永登
    甘肃省永登县全民动手发展教育事业，目前已经实现乡乡有中学，成为甘肃省第一个普及中学教育的县。
    永登县1949年时只有初中一所，学生七十九人，很多乡找不到一个中学生，是甘肃省文化落后地区之一。1956年增加了一所公办中学，连原有的一所，总共有中学生一千三百零二人，县里有许多高小毕业生都不能升学。在生产大跃进中，农民群众迫切要求文化上大翻身。4月间，普及了小学教育。5月间，第一所县办大学成立。这时，群众办学的热情更加高涨。全县二十二个乡就办起各类中学三十六所，其中位于山区的七千人的大乡——七山乡办起了十所中学。这个乡成立第一所农业中学时，全乡农民高举彩旗、敲锣打鼓地表示庆祝，同时还给学校献地、献旗、献羊。
    这些中学有工业、农业、园艺、牧业、林业、水利、卫生和师范等专业学校。办学中群众发挥了高度积极性，纷纷腾房子，或献工献料盖房，有的农民自动给学校烧砖、烧石灰。清水乡农业中学无教室，农民们自己搭起草棚；没有桌凳，农民们就泥上土台代替。这些中学的兴办没有花国家一分钱，农民自己也花钱不多。
    为了解决民办中学师资问题，永登县人民委员会还从全县九百多名小学教员中挑选中等师范毕业和高中毕业的二十四名，进行了短期集训，然后分配到各中学担任专职教师，教授语文、数学等文化课；同时聘请优秀社员、医生、专业技术学校毕业的干部以及工厂、煤矿、地质队的技术人员为兼职教员，讲授技术课；政治教员由各乡的总支书记担任。课本问题，文化课暂时采用一般中学的课本，技术教材由技术教员编写讲义，结合实习讲授技术理论。
    这些学校一般是二年毕业，实行半工半读。　（新华社）
