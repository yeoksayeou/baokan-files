　　Children's Friendship
　　By our correspondent  Chen Jiabao
    One morning in May, I came to the "Home for the Children of Martyrs" in the suburbs of Hanoi. A group of innocent Vietnamese children surrounded me. Some held pencils, others raised dolls and told me, "Uncle, these are gifts from German children." Ten-year-old Phạm Hải Việt told me that he not only received gifts from German friends, but also had a very good German "brother" in Berlin, introduced by his sister who was studying in Berlin. He said, "I know that Germany has the Elbe River, and our motherland has the Bianhai River. On both sides of the two rivers, workers and peasants are masters on one side, and reactionaries oppress the people on the other." He said, "German children like us, and we like German children too." He then told me in detail how the children had been carrying water and applying fertilizer themselves for several months, planting several acres of corn, and using the money they received to buy fishing rods and bamboo baskets to send to their friends in Berlin. Their innocent friendship has made the children of these two countries, separated by vast oceans, as close as siblings.
    How did the upsurge of Vietnamese and German children exchanging gifts and making friends begin? It turned out that at the end of last year, when the children in Berlin were celebrating Christmas, some of them asked the Radio of the German Democratic Republic to help forward gifts to Vietnamese children and suggested that the radio station launch a gift-giving campaign among all German children. The radio station agreed to their request. From then on, a "self-reliance" gift-giving movement unfolded enthusiastically throughout the German Democratic Republic. The children used the money they earned from their own labor to buy gifts. Elementary school students in Berlin collected more than ten tons of scrap iron in three weeks and used the money to buy dolls, vests, harmonicas, and other items to send to Hanoi. Some children saved their pocket money and bought wool to knit sweaters and embroider handkerchiefs for Vietnamese children. In just over a month, the radio station received a total of 170 tons of gifts. Some gifts were also sent by children from West Germany.
    While giving gifts, German children also wrote hundreds of letters to Vietnamese children. A five-year-old child enclosed his own photo in a letter. He wrote: "This is a gift bought with my pocket money. How much I want to see your smile. Please remember my appearance, and when we grow up, we may have the opportunity to meet. This letter was written for me by my mother because I can't write yet."
    In January of this year, a silver plane flew to Hanoi, and representatives of the Radio of the German Democratic Republic delivered the first batch of gifts from German children to Vietnam. More than 100,000 children in northern Vietnam then launched a movement to "further consolidate our friendship." So far, this movement is still continuing. Children in Hanoi and other cities enthusiastically participated in the
  activities of "Understanding the German Democratic Republic." The children went through the libraries of various schools, looking for books about the German Democratic Republic to read and learn about German history, geography, and people. Guangzhong Elementary School in Hanoi held the game "Pigeons Fly to Berlin." On a large world map, they drew the major cities along the route from Hanoi to Berlin. The child with the best academic performance was able to move his pigeon forward, and the winner was the one who reached Berlin the fastest. Some children dressed up as learned old men from Germany and reported to the children about the life and study of the German people. In addition, more than 1,000 children participated in a quiz on the German Democratic Republic organized by the "Young Pioneers Newspaper." These lively and meaningful activities enhanced their understanding and friendship with the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, many children in Vietnam also collected waste materials everywhere and used the money they received to buy gifts. Young Pioneers in Nam Dinh and other places also launched a movement to "Plant Vietnam-Germany Friendship Trees" and engraved the word "Friendship" on the trees.
    The divided state of Vietnam and Germany has left a deep impression on the children's hearts. A little girl from the Haiphong Southern Children's Camp handed a bamboo hat left to her by her mother, who still lived in the South, to a representative of the Radio of the German Democratic Republic, asking him to help send it to a child in West Germany. She said to the representative, "Our hearts all desire the reunification of the motherland."
    Children in northern Vietnam entrusted the Vietnam Red Cross to send five tons of gifts from German children to children in South Vietnam, but these gifts could not be sent due to the obstruction of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.
    In a letter to the children in the South on this year's "June 1st" Children's Day, the children in Hanoi said, "German children can send so many gifts from a distant place, but we are so close, yet it is so difficult to send gifts." (Attached photo)

　　孩子们的友情
　　本报记者  陈家宝
    5月的一个清早，我来到河内郊外“烈士儿女教养院”。一群天真烂漫的越南小朋友把我围住，他们有的拿着铅笔、有的举起洋娃娃告诉我：“叔叔，这是德国小朋友送给我们的礼物。”十岁的范海越告诉我，他不但收到德国朋友的礼物，而且在柏林还有一个很要好的德国“兄弟”，这是他的在柏林读书的姐姐给介绍的。他说：“我知道德国有易北河，我们祖国有边海河，两条河的两岸一边是工人农民当主人，一边是反动派欺压人民。”他说“德国的小朋友喜欢我们，我们也喜欢德国的小朋友。”他接着一五一十地告诉我，几个月来孩子们怎样自己挑水下肥，种了几亩玉米，把收到的钱买了鱼竿和竹篮送给远在柏林的小朋友。他们这种天真无暇的友情已使这两个远隔重洋的国家的儿童亲如手足了。
    越德两国小朋友互赠礼物交朋友的热潮，是怎样开始的呢？原来去年年底，当柏林的小朋友欢度圣诞节的时候，他们有人要求德意志民主共和国广播电台协助把礼物转寄给越南儿童，并且建议广播电台在全德国儿童中间发起赠礼运动，电台答应了他们的要求。从此以后，一个“自力更生”的赠礼运动在民主德国各地热烈展开。小朋友们以自己劳动得来的钱购买礼物。柏林小学生在三个星期内拣到了十多吨废铁，把得到的钱买了洋娃娃、背心、口琴等寄到河内来。有的小朋友把零用钱节省下来，买毛线给越南少年织毛衣、绣手绢。仅仅一个多月，广播电台共收到礼物一百七十吨。其中也有西德小朋友寄来的礼物。
    在赠礼的同时，德国少年还给越南少年们写了成百封信，一位五岁的小朋友在信里附来了自己的相片。他写道：“这是我的零用钱换来的礼物。我多么想看见你的笑容。请你记住我的相貌，将来长大了，我们也许有机会见面。这封信是我告诉妈妈代写的，因为我还不会写字。”
    今年1月间，一架银色的飞机飞到河内，民主德国广播电台的代表把德国少年的第一批礼物送到了越南。越南北方十多万少年儿童从此掀起了一个“让我们的友谊更加巩固”的运动。到目前为止，这个运动还在继续开展。河内和其他城市的少年儿童热烈地参加了
  “了解民主德国”的活动。孩子们走遍各个学校的图书室，寻找关于民主德国的书籍来阅读，了解德国的历史、地理、人物等。河内光中小学举办“鸽子飞到柏林”的游戏，在一张大幅的世界地图上，他们画下了从河内到柏林途中的各个重要城市，参加比赛的小朋友，谁的学习成绩好，谁的鸽子就向前飞一程，最后看谁最快飞到柏林。有的小朋友化装成从德国来的博学老人，向小朋友们报告德国人民的生活和学习。此外，还有一千多个少年参加了“少年先锋报”举办的关于民主德国常识的测验。这些生动和富有意义的活动增进了他们对民主德国的了解和友谊。同时，越南许多小朋友也到处拣废物，用得到的钱买礼物。南定等地的少先队员还发动了“种植越德友谊树”的运动，而且在树上刻上了“友谊”的字样。
    越南和德国国家被分裂的状态，在孩子们的心里留下了深刻的印象。海防南方儿童营的一个小女孩把还住在南方的妈妈给她留下的笠帽，亲手交给民主德国广播电台代表团的一位代表，请他帮助送给一位西德的小朋友。她对这位代表说：“我们的心都要求祖国统一”。
    越南北方的儿童委托越南红十字会把五吨来自德国少年的礼物送给南越儿童，但是由于吴庭艳当局的阻挠，这些礼物一直寄不出去。
    河内少年在今年“六一”寄给南方少年的信里说：“德国的小朋友能够从遥远的地方寄来那么多的礼物，可是我们离得这么近，寄礼物却是这样困难。”（附图片）
