Xinhua News Agency, 15th. 1,900 graduates from the affiliated Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools of six universities in the capital, including Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Beijing Railway Institute, held a joint celebration in Tsinghua Garden today. Dong Chun-cai, Vice Minister of Education, responsible personnel from relevant departments in Beijing, heads of relevant universities, and faculty members from various Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary Schools also attended the celebration. A huge couplet at the venue expressed the determination of these worker-peasant students: "Break down superstitions, liberate the mind, and welcome the high tide of the technological and cultural revolution"; "Plant the red flag, uproot the white flag, and aspire to be proletarian intellectuals."

At the celebration, Hao Jianxiu, a national model worker in the textile industry, delivered a speech on behalf of all the graduates. She said that workers and peasants were the oppressed in the old society and had very low levels of education, and it was the Party that cultivated us. In order to master the weapons of class struggle and the struggle against nature, and for the sake of the Party's glorious cause, the students have demonstrated a tenacious and hardworking fighting spirit and overcome unexpected difficulties over the past four years. Today, everyone can proudly say that we have finally successfully completed the tasks given to us by the Party and the state. She expressed on behalf of all the graduates that they will continue to actively respond to the Party's call as in the past, act as pioneers in the technological revolution and cultural revolution, become people with a communist style, overcome obstacles, and bravely climb to the peak of science.

Dong Chun-cai, Vice Minister of Education, then spoke. He encouraged the worker-peasant students, whether in their new learning positions or work positions, to aspire to great things, capture the cultural fortress, and climb to the peak of science, so that everyone can become a staunch and proficient soldier loyal to communism. To achieve this, efforts must be made in two aspects: First, earnestly study Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's policies and guidelines; in particular, study Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works that combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Second, work hard to master cultural and scientific knowledge.

At the celebration, a congratulatory letter from Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education, was also read to them.

After the meeting, teachers, students, leaders, and guests toured the garden together.

    立大志攻下科学文化堡垒
    首都六大学附设工农速成中学毕业生联欢
    新华社15日讯　中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、北京工业学院、北京铁道学院等六校附设的工农速成中学毕业生一千九百人，今天在清华园举行联欢大会。教育部副部长董纯才和北京市有关部门、各有关高等学校的负责人和各工农速成中学的教职员也参加了联欢。会场上的巨幅对联表达了这些工农学生们的决心：“破除迷信，解放思想，迎接技术与文化革命高潮”；“插上红旗，拔掉白旗，立志做无产阶级知识分子”。
    在联欢大会上，全国纺织工业劳动模范郝建秀代表全体毕业生致词。她说，我们工人和农民在旧社会是被压迫者，文化程度都很低，是党培养了我们。为了掌握阶级斗争和向自然作斗争的武器，为了党的光辉事业，四年来，同学们发挥了顽强刻苦的战斗精神，克服了意想不到的困难。今天，大家可以自豪地说，我们终于胜利地完成了党和国家给我们的任务了。她代表全体毕业生表示：今后要像过去一样积极响应党的号召，作技术革命和文化革命的急先锋，成为具有共产主义风格的人，斩荆披棘，英勇地攀登上科学的高峰。
    教育部副部长董纯才接着讲话。他勉励工农学生不论在新的学习岗位上或工作岗位上，一定要立大志攻下文化堡垒，登上科学高峰，人人成为红透专深的忠于共产主义的战士。这样必须从两方面努力：第一、认真学习马列主义理论和党的政策、方针；特别要学习毛泽东同志将马列主义普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的理论著作。第二、要刻苦努力掌握文化科学知识。
    联欢会上，还宣读了教育部部长杨秀峰给他们的一封贺信。
    会后，师生们和首长、来宾们一起游园。
