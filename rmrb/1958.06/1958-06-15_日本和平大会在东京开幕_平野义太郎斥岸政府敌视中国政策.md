Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: The Japanese Peace Congress opened in Tokyo today. More than 500 representatives from local areas and organizations across the country participated in the congress.

　　The congress, presided over by a presidium composed of Kazami Akira, Matsumoto Jiichiro, Yamamoto Kumaichi, Fujima Miga, and Matsumoto Shichiro, will be held for two consecutive days.

　　“Strengthening International Peace” Lenin International Prize winner Ikuo Yasui first addressed the congress today. He said that he believed the real recipients of the Lenin Prize were the Japanese people who were resolutely fighting to ban nuclear weapons. He pointed out that the most important task for the Japanese people at present is to strive to prevent Japan from implementing nuclear armament and to urge the Japanese government to change its hostile policy towards China.

　　Socialist Party representative Inejiro Asanuma, Communist Party representative Yoshio Shiga, and Japan Teachers Union representative Miyoji Hiragaki successively addressed the congress. Next, Yoshitaro Hirano delivered a report entitled "Characteristics of Recent Domestic and International Situations and the Direction of the Future Peace Movement." Senroku Uehara and Shigeto Tsuru then made supplementary reports respectively.

　　In his report, Yoshitaro Hirano pointed out that in the current situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, but imperialism is still frantically preparing to launch an atomic war, it is very important to strive for peace. The movement to safeguard peace should also be strengthened in Japan. Hirano strongly condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government for yielding to the United States, currying favor with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and adopting a hostile policy toward China. He said that a powerful mass movement must be launched to urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to fundamentally change its policy and normalize relations between Japan and China. This is also one of the most important tasks of Japan's peace, friendship, and trade normalization movement at present.

　　Hirano also pointed out that the Japanese peace movement should strive to achieve the following goals: to designate Japan and Asia as nuclear-free zones; for the United States and Britain to immediately stop testing nuclear weapons and hold East-West summit talks; to withdraw all US troops and remove all US military bases from Japan and Korea; to withdraw nuclear weapons from Okinawa and return Okinawa to Japan.

　　Tomorrow, the congress will hold group discussions on issues such as opposition to nuclear armament, Japan-China relations and international cooperation, and the peace movement, and will also decide on the proposals submitted by the Japanese Peace Congress to the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference. Finally, Japanese representatives to this conference will also be elected.

    日本和平大会在东京开幕
    平野义太郎斥岸政府敌视中国政策
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本和平大会今天在东京开幕。来自全国各地的地方和团体代表五百多人参加了大会。
    大会由风见章、松本治一郎、山本熊一、藤间身加荣和松本七郎组成的主席团主持，将连续举行两天。
    “加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金获得者安井郁在今天的大会上首先致词。他说，他认为列宁奖金真正的受奖者是为禁止核武器进行坚强斗争的日本人民。他指出，日本人民目前最重要的任务是争取使日本不实行核武装和促使日本政府改变敌视中国的政策。
    社会党代表浅沼稻次郎、共产党代表志贺义雄、日本教职员工会代表平垣美代司相继在大会上致词。接着，平野义太郎在会上做了题为“最近国内外形势的特征和今后和平运动的方向”的报告。上原专禄和都留重人接着分别做了补充报告。
    平野义太郎在报告中指出，在现在东风压倒西风但是帝国主义还在疯狂准备发动原子战争的形势下，为争取和平进行努力是非常重要的。在日本也应该加强维护和平的运动。平野强烈谴责了岸信介政府屈从美国、取悦台湾蒋介石集团，采取敌视中国的政策。他说，必须展开强大的人民群众的运动，促使岸信介政府根本改变政策，使日中两国关系趋向正常。这也是日本的和平、友好与贸易正常化运动的当前最重要任务之一。
    平野还指出，日本的和平运动应当为争取实现以下目标而努力：把日本与亚洲划为非核武装地区；美英两国立即停止试验核武器和举行东西方首脑会谈；从日本境内和朝鲜撤出全部美军和撤除全部美军基地；从冲绳撤出核武器并把冲绳归还日本。
    大会明天将分组讨论有关反对核武装、日中关系与国际合作、和平运动等问题，并且决定日本和平大会向裁军和国际合作大会提出的议案，最后还将选出参加这个大会的日本代表。
