    On the occasion of the first "Soviet Youth Day," we, on behalf of all Chinese youth, extend our fraternal greetings and warmest congratulations to you and, through you, to all members of the Komsomol and youth of the Soviet Union.
    We are happy for the achievements of the Soviet youth in the cause of building communism and defending world peace, and we sincerely wish you even greater victories in realizing the magnificent program adopted by the 13th Congress of the Soviet Komsomol for youth to participate in the construction of communism, and in realizing the great task put forward by the Soviet Communist Party to the Soviet people of surpassing the United States in industrial and agricultural production in a short period of time.
    The great friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union is being consolidated day by day with the rapid development of our common cause. Today, in the struggle against modern revisionism, the rock-solid unity and unbreakable friendship between the people and youth of our two countries has once again been demonstrated. Let us hold hands even more closely and advance bravely under the red banner of Marxism-Leninism.
