    Extracting Germanium from Coal Ash
    Changchun Finds a New Way to Refine Rare Metals

    (Report from our newspaper) The Changchun City Gas Company has recently successfully experimented with extracting the rare metal germanium dioxide from flue dust, opening up a simple and easy new way to produce germanium in large quantities.

    Germanium is a rare and dispersed element with valuable semiconductor properties. This element has been widely used in the electrical, radio and other industrial sectors.

    At present, the alloy method is generally used to extract germanium from the ash after coal is burned. The Ministry of Metallurgy had experimented with this method, but found that the loss of germanium during the extraction process was too great, so it abandoned the experiment. Later, the workers of the Changchun City Gas Company used large flue dust as raw material and began to explore and experiment with a new method starting in June of last year. The experiment was successful, and the purity of the product was good. The company is now preparing to expand production.

    This method is simple and easy to implement, and can be used wherever there is flue dust from burning coal.

    向煤灰要锗
    长春找到提炼稀有金属的新途径
    本报讯　长春市煤气公司最近试验从烟道灰中提取稀有金属二氧化锗试验成功，它为大量生产锗开辟了简便易行的新途径。
    锗是一种稀有而又分散的原素，具有半导体性能极为贵重。这种元素在电气、无线电等工业部门中已广泛应用。
    目前一般都采用合金法从煤燃烧后的灰尘中提取锗，这种方法是冶金部曾经试验过，发现这样在提取过程中锗的损失太大，就放弃了试验。后来长春市煤气公司职工们利用大烟道灰作原料，从去年6月开始采用一种新的方法摸索试验。结果试验成功，而且产品的纯度好。现在这个公司正准备扩大生产。
    这种方法简单易行，凡是有烧煤的烟道灰的都可以采用。
