Fuzhou Match Factory Vigorously Establishes "Satellite" Factories
Fujian Provincial Party Committee Calls on All Old Factories in the Province to Work Hard for a Month to Set Up More Factories

(By Our Newspaper) The Fuzhou Match Factory, within twenty days, without increasing equipment or manpower, established ten "satellite" factories in one go: wild fiber, sandwich board, motor repair, farm tool repair, phosphate fertilizer, battery separator, plywood, toothpick popsicle sticks, soundproof board, and monosodium glutamate.

The Fuzhou Match Factory is an old factory with more than 700 employees. Because match production is determined by sales, the production task is only one-third of the factory's total production capacity. In the great leap forward, the workers used a lot of brains and wanted to build an accessory factory, but because of professional thinking, they didn't succeed. For example, the repair workshop made two water pumps, and the workers asked the factory director if they could accept orders from outside. The factory director said: "The match factory makes matches, how can it do this kind of thing?" Therefore, the workers' wishes were not realized.

Later, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee put forward the call for "the whole people to run factories, focusing on small scale and widespread blooming," and the workers in each workshop, according to their own equipment and technical conditions, proposed to fully utilize the existing potential and set up factories themselves. The factory Party committee also strongly supported the workers' suggestions and called on all factory workers to set up new factories by whatever means possible, self-financing and self-constructing. The workers' enthusiasm and drive to set up factories greatly increased. At a symposium, everyone offered suggestions, and on the spot, they proposed the idea of ​​setting up "satellite" factories. For example, the old worker Chen Zhonglang suggested setting up a battery separator factory, saying that setting up such a factory has four major benefits: less manpower, high output, low cost, and utilization of existing equipment without investment.

Of course, there are many difficulties in opening ten factories in a short period of time. However, because they implemented the factory-building policy of "hen laying eggs, from small to large, from less to more, from indigenous to foreign," the difficult problems were solved more smoothly.

In terms of equipment: first indigenous then foreign, first wood then iron, everything is simple. For example, the wild fiber factory originally needed a steaming sphere to cook the fiber, so they used an old cooking pot that had been shelved for a long time to replace it; the old cooking pot was not big enough, so they found old iron plates to weld together; the workers did not know welding technology, so they went to brother factories to learn; without a welding machine, the electrician team, which had only one technician and one apprentice, made a simple welding machine. Most of the machinery and equipment of the fiber factory, such as the cotton loosener and the washing pool, are made of wood.

In terms of technology: learning while doing, doing while learning, master teaching apprentice, apprentice teaching apprentice. When encountering difficult and complex problems, they hold "Zhuge Liang meetings" to solve them. The farm tool repair factory has a total of five technicians from machine shops and four apprentices. When they encounter technical problems they don't understand, they go to brother factories to learn. The technology of the fiber factory is relatively complex. The workers experimented, learned, produced, and innovated technology and improved tools, and quickly mastered the technology.

In terms of raw materials: mainly using the factory's old materials and scraps. In the past, the match factory used to burn wood chips, sawdust, etc. Now that the small factories are set up, they have become treasures. For example, soundproof boards are made of wood chips, sawdust, etc. The workers' slogan is: "Every piece of wood must be 100% utilized."

As for cadres, apart from a few people transferred from the municipal party committee for the fiber factory, the other nine factories were not equipped with full-time cadres. All the workers themselves acted as factory directors, and they were responsible for planning all construction tasks, with the leadership providing support and assistance. These worker directors are full of energy. The worker Huang Zongjin was appointed as the director of the motor repair factory at noon, and he drew up the plan in the afternoon, went to the street to buy materials in the evening, and climbed up the electric pole early on Sunday morning to dismantle waste copper wires to make materials.

On June 8, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee issued a call to party committees at all levels and workers throughout the province, requiring them to earnestly study the Fuzhou Match Factory's method of using existing equipment and technical forces, adopting the method of "hen hatching chickens," one factory for multiple uses, one machine for multiple uses, one material for multiple uses, and one person for multiple uses. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee requested all 1,800 old factories in the province, wherever conditions permit, to work hard for a month to set up more "satellite" factories. (Attached photo)

### 一厂多用  一机多用  一物多用  一人多用  福州火柴厂大办“卫星”厂  福建省委号召全省老厂苦战一月办起更多的工厂

    一厂多用  一机多用  一物多用  一人多用
    福州火柴厂大办“卫星”厂
    福建省委号召全省老厂苦战一月办起更多的工厂
    本报讯  福州火柴厂在二十天内，不增加设备和人力，一鼓作气办起了野生纤维、夹立板、电机修配、农具修配、磷肥、电池隔离片、胶合板、牙签冰棒条、隔音板、味精十个“卫星”工厂。
    福州火柴厂是一个有职工七百多人的老工厂，由于火柴生产以销定产，生产任务仅及全厂生产能力的三分之一。大跃进声中，工人们用了不少脑筋，想搞个附件工厂，因为专业思想在作怪，终于没有搞成。如修配车间做出了两台抽水机，工人们问厂长能不能对外接受订货。厂长说：“火柴厂是做火柴的，怎么能干这玩艺儿。”因此，工人的愿望没有实现。
    后来中共福建省委提出了“全民办工厂，小型为主、遍地开花”的号召，各车间工人根据自己的设备和技术条件，纷纷提出要充分发挥现有潜力，自己动手办工厂。工厂党委也大力支持了职工们的建议，并且号召全厂职工会什么办什么，自筹自设新工厂。工人们办厂热情和干劲大为高涨。在一次座谈会上，人人献策，当场就提出了办“卫星”厂的建议。如老工人陈钟朗提议办电池隔离片厂，并说办这样个厂子有四大好处：用人少；产量高；成本低；利用原有设备，不用投资。
    当然在短时间内开办十个厂，有许多困难。但由于他们贯彻了“母鸡下蛋、从小到大、从少到多、从土到洋”的办厂方针，困难问题就比较顺利地解决了。
    在设备方面：先土后洋，先木后铁，一切因陋就简。如野生纤维厂蒸煮纤维本来要用蒸球，他们就利用搁置很久的旧煮锅来代替；旧煮锅不够大，就找旧铁板来焊接；工人不会电焊技术，就到兄弟厂去学习；没有电焊机，就由只有一个技工和一个学徒的电工组做了一部简便电焊机。纤维厂的松棉机、漂洗池等大部分机器设备都是木头做的。
    在技术方面：边做边学，边学边做，师傅带徒弟，徒弟又带徒弟。遇到困难、复杂的题题，就开“诸葛亮会议”来解决。农具修配厂共有五个机器店出身的技工和四个学徒，他们碰到不懂的技术，就到兄弟厂去学习。纤维厂的技术是比较复杂的，职工们边试验，边学习，边生产，边革新技术改进工具，迅速掌握了技术。
    在原料方面：主要是利用本厂旧料和残料。过去，火柴厂把木片、锯糠等等拿去烧火。现在小工厂一办起来，它们都成了宝贝。如隔音板就是用木屑、锯糠等做出来的。职工们的口号是：“每一根木头都要百分之百地利用。”
    至于干部，除了纤维厂由市委调来了几个人外，其他九个工厂都没有另外配备专职干部，全由工人自己当厂长，一切建厂任务由他们筹办，领导给予支持和协助。这些工人厂长干劲很足。工人黄宗锦，中午被委为电机修配厂厂长，下午就把计划订出来，晚上就上街买材料，第二天星期天清早就爬上电杆拆废铜线做材料。
    6日8日，中共福建省委向各级党委和全省工人发出号召，要求他们认真学习福州火柴厂利用原有设备、技术力量，采取“母鸡孵小鸡”、一厂多用、一机多用、一物多用、一人多用的办法。福建省委要求全省一千八百个老厂，凡是有条件的，都要苦战一月，办起更多的“卫星”工厂。（附图片）
