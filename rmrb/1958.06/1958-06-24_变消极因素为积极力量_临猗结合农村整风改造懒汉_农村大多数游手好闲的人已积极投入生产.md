Turning Negative Factors into Positive Forces
Linyi Combines Rural Rectification with Reforming Loafers
Most Idlers in Rural Areas Have Actively Engaged in Production

(Our Taiyuan Dispatch) Reporter Feng Jianwei, Yang Yi, report: In the rural rectification movement, Linyi County, Shanxi Province, concentrated on carrying out a movement against laziness, establishing socialist labor views and attitudes, so that some people infected with laziness and rogue habits were basically reformed, turning the negative factors left over from the old society into a positive force for the current agricultural leap forward.

Currently, the vast majority of such idlers in the county's rural areas have undergone obvious changes. According to statistics from 27 townships including Nan Yao and Meiyang, among more than 500 relatively lazy and idle people, 80% to 90% have participated in agricultural labor and actively engaged in production, and a new atmosphere of "everyone likes to work, and there are no idle people in every cooperative" has begun to emerge. This spring, the county's labor attendance rate has reached a consistent full attendance, up from the previous high of 88%. At the same time, because loafers and good-for-nothings have been reformed, agricultural cooperatives have become more consolidated. In the past, cooperative cadres and advanced cooperative members were very dissatisfied with loafers and good-for-nothings. Now, cooperative members happily say: "Loafers have undergone a great change, production will definitely develop, and agricultural cooperatives will definitely be run well." Some said that reforming loafers and good-for-nothings is a four-benefit policy that benefits the country, the family, the cooperative, and themselves. In the past, disputes between cooperative members caused by unbalanced labor and equal distribution of food, and family discord caused by laziness and idleness, have also been resolved.

After the rural rectification movement in Linyi County was launched, many cooperative members requested in criticism meetings and big-character posters that people who were infected with laziness and rogue habits and did not actively engage in agricultural cooperative production be educated and reformed. Based on the opinions of the farmers, the Linyi County Committee of the Communist Party of China investigated and analyzed the situation in the county. It was found that loafers and good-for-nothings currently account for about 5% of the total labor force in the county. The investigation proved that in the rural areas after land reform and the realization of agricultural cooperation, loafers, rogues, and other idle people are rare, and they are no longer a social class, but only a small number of people are infected with this bad habit to varying degrees, mainly left over from the old society and have not been completely reformed. However, the existence of such people has brought many new problems to the countryside. That is the contradiction between insufficient labor in the Great Leap Forward in production and the fact that loafers and good-for-nothings eat without working. If loafers and good-for-nothings can be reformed, this contradiction can be resolved. Therefore, it was decided to launch a mass movement against laziness throughout the county.

In the process of launching the anti-laziness movement and reforming loafers, all localities have focused on socialist labor education of labor being glorious and laziness being shameful through cooperative member meetings, people's schools, and political night schools; and in response to the fact that a few people have been lazy and have rogue habits for a long time, they have used the facts of comparing diligence and thrift with laziness to explain the significance of diligent and thrifty labor and the harm of laziness and rogue behavior. In particular, some places pointed out sharply that laziness is relying on exploitation to live, and there are no parasitic conditions after cooperation. If they are not reformed, they will inevitably harm the country, the cooperative, the family, and themselves. Many loafers were shocked. They originally thought that diligence and thrift and laziness were personal matters. Now they have improved their understanding and deeply felt the seriousness of their mistakes, and consciously demanded reform.

On the basis of ideological education, mass ideological debates have been widely carried out in various places to enable the vast number of farmers to further understand the importance of reforming loafers and good-for-nothings and the attitudes that should be adopted, so that the vast number of farmers have changed from despising, ignoring, and satirizing loafers and rogues to caring, helping, and actively criticizing and supervising them, and paying attention to the reform work anytime and anywhere. In response to the different psychology and temperament of loafers and good-for-nothings, the Xusheng Agricultural Cooperative in Beimacun mobilized cadres and relatives to persuade them, and also helped them in their lives, assigning them appropriate farm work according to their physical strength, and patiently imparting technology to them. Any slight change was promptly commended and encouraged. As a result, all 13 loafers and good-for-nothings in the cooperative, except for two who were sick, were reformed, and their labor quantity reached the level of ordinary cooperative members, and their income was equal to the average amount of all cooperative members. Many people jumped to become people with surplus money, and these people and the cadres who helped reform them became close friends and still maintain contact.

The Linyi County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently sent people to inspect the work of reforming loafers in seven townships and summarized the anti-laziness movement in the county. The County Committee believes that opposing laziness is a long-term task of changing customs and transforming people's ideology and style, and this reform is only the beginning. In order to consolidate the reform results, continue to help loafers and good-for-nothings establish socialist labor concepts, and completely transform into a new type of farmer who loves labor and the collective, the following systems are being promoted throughout the county based on the successful experiences of various places: Listing reform work as part of the "three loves" pact, regularly checking the implementation and assigning special personnel to regularly conduct labor education to them in combination with production, regularly checking and evaluating the transformation, and promptly criticizing and commending. A labor plan is set for each quarter and month for a small number of people with more serious laziness and rogue habits, which is supervised by the cooperative and team to complete on schedule, and youth supervision posts are set up to observe their transformation for a long time. Some cooperatives also stipulate methods of rewarding diligence and thrift and spurring laziness in the distribution system. In this way, the work of reforming loafers is kept regularized.

    变消极因素为积极力量
    临猗结合农村整风改造懒汉
    农村大多数游手好闲的人已积极投入生产
    本报太原电  记者冯建伟、杨义报道：山西省临猗县在农村整风运动中，集中地进行了一次反对懒气、树立社会主义劳动观点和态度的运动，使一部分染有懒惰、流氓习气的人得到基本改造，把旧社会遗留下来的消极因素，变成当前农业大跃进的积极力量。
    目前，全县农村这种游手好闲的人，绝大部分已经有了明显的转变。据南姚、嵋阳等二十七个乡统计，在五百多个比较懒惰和不务正业的人中，已经有80％到90％的人参加了农业劳动，积极生产，开始出现“人人劳动好，社社无闲人”的新气象。今年春季全县劳动出勤率，已由过去最高的88％达到了经常满勤。同时，由于懒汉、二流子得到改造，使农业社内部更加巩固。过去社干部和先进社员对懒汉、二流子非常不满，现在社员高兴地说：懒汉大转变，生产一定能发展，农业社一定能办好。有的说改造懒汉二流子是利国、利家、利社、利己的四利政策。过去由于劳动不平衡而分配食粮相等引起的社员之间的纠纷，因为懒惰、不务正业引起的家庭不和现象，也随着解决。
    临猗县农村整风运动开展以后，许多农业社社员在鸣放会议和大字报中，要求对染有懒惰、流氓习气而不积极从事农业社生产的人，进行教育改造。中共临猗县委根据农民的意见，调查分析了全县的情况。发现当前农村懒汉、二流子等，大约占全县劳动力总数的5％左右。调查证明，在经过土地改革和实现农业合作化后的农村里，懒汉、流氓等不务正业的人，已经很少见，已经不是属于一种社会阶层，而仅是一少部分人染有轻重不等的这种恶劣习惯，主要是旧社会遗留下来没有得到彻底改造。但是，由于这种人的存在，已经给农村带来许多新的问题。这就是在生产大跃进中劳力不足和懒汉、二流子不劳而食的矛盾。如果把懒汉、二流子改造过来，这个矛盾就可以得到解决。因此，决定在全县范围内开展一次群众性的反懒气运动。
    在开展反对懒气、改造懒汉的过程中，各地都通过社员大会、民校和政治夜校等，着重进行了劳动光荣、懒惰羞耻的社会主义劳动教育；并且针对少数人懒惰和流氓习气时间较久的情况，用勤俭和懒惰对比的事实，讲明勤俭劳动的意义，懒惰和流氓行为的危害。特别是有些地方一针见血地指出，懒惰是靠剥削生活，合作化后已无寄生条件，再不改造就必然害国、害社、害家、害己的时候，使许多懒汉大吃一惊，原来认为勤俭和懒惰是个人问题，现在认识提高，深感自己错误的严重性，自觉地要求改造。
    在思想教育的基础上，各地普遍开展了群众性的思想大辩论，使广大农民进一步认识改造懒汉、二流子等的重要意义和应该采取的态度，使广大农民对懒汉、流氓由卑视、冷淡、讽刺，到关怀、帮助和积极批评监督，随时随地注意改造工作。北马村旭升农业社针对懒汉、二流子的不同心理和脾性，发动干部和亲友上门规劝，并且在生活上帮助，根据体力分配适当农活，耐心传授给他们技术。稍有转变，就及时表扬鼓励。结果，全社十三名懒汉、二流子，除两人有病外，都得到改造，劳动数量达到一般社员水平，收入也和全社社员平均数量相等。许多人一跃而成了有余钱的人，这些人和帮助改造的干部成了知心朋友，至今还保持联系。
    中共临猗县委会最近派人检查了七个乡改造懒汉的工作，并且总结了全县反懒气运动的情况。县委认为反对懒气是一项移风易俗、改造人们思想作风的长期任务，这次改造仅仅是个开始。为了巩固改造成果，继续帮助懒汉、二流子等树立社会主义劳动观点，彻底改变为热爱劳动、热爱集体的新型农民，根据各地成功经验，正在全县推广以下几种制度：把改造工作列为“三爱”公约的内容，经常检查执行情况和确定专人，经常结合生产向他们进行劳动教育，定期检查评比转变情况，及时批评表扬。对少数懒惰、流氓习气较重的人，实行每季每月订劳动计划，由社、队监督按期完成，并且设立青年监督岗，长期考察他们转变情况。有的社还规定在分配制度上奖励勤俭、鞭策懒惰的办法。这样，使改造懒汉的工作保持经常化。
