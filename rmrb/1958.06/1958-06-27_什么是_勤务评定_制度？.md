What is the "Performance Rating" System?

The so-called "Performance Rating" system is a measure used by the reactionary Japanese government to strengthen its control over the political ideology of school faculty and staff and the entire education system. Under the guise of "performance evaluation," it stipulates that school principals must report in detail to local education authorities on the situation of each teacher, even including the clothes they wear. It also stipulates that the words and deeds of teachers and staff must be recorded in "performance books," and then, based on the "performance" in the "performance books," teachers and staff can be arbitrarily threatened and dismissed. This is, in effect, a blacklist for persecuting teachers and staff. The purpose of this system is to deprive teachers and staff of their freedom and rights, to suppress the democratic and progressive ideas of teachers and staff, and to suppress the struggle of teachers' and staff unions to safeguard and fight for the legitimate rights of teachers and staff.

This reactionary measure by the Japanese government has aroused strong opposition from the Japanese people. Since the Ministry of Education issued the implementation rules of this system in July last year, educational workers across Japan have launched a struggle. After this system came into effect in late April this year, protest movements across Japan reached a new high. (Ru Hou)

    什么是“勤务评定”制度？
    所谓“勤务评定”制度，是日本反动政府加强控制学校教职员的政治思想和整个教育事业的一种措施。它以“考绩”为名，规定各学校的校长要向当地的教育当局详细报告每个教员的情况，甚至包括他穿的什么衣服。并规定要把教职员的言行记在“成绩簿”上，然后根据“成绩簿”的“成绩”任意威胁和开除教职员。这实际上是迫害教职员的黑名单。这个制度的目的，是用来剥夺教职员的自由权利，打击教职员的民主进步思想，并且打击教职员工会维护和争取教职员正当权利的斗争。
    日本政府的这一反动措施，激起了日本人民的强烈反对，从去年7月文部省发布这项制度的实施规定时起，日本全国教育工作者便展开了斗争。今年4月下旬这项制度生效后，日本全国各地的抗议运动达到新的高潮。　（汝厚）
