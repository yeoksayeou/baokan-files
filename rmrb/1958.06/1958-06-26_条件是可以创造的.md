    Conditions Can Be Created
    Jin Wen
    The members of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Ye County, Shandong Province, in the process of technical revolution, adhering to the principle of "everyone learns technology, everyone understands science," have enabled agricultural scientific research to take root there and greatly promoted production. People who hear this news are encouraged. But some people also believe that the scientific research achievements of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative have its special conditions. The implication is that other agricultural cooperatives may not be able to do it.
    What are the conditions of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative? They, like the members of agricultural cooperatives across the country, are extremely ordinary farmers. Among them, there are only eight young people who graduated from higher primary school and junior high school. In the technical innovation movement, the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative first cultivated these young people into small, local experts who mastered certain scientific and technical skills. In addition, they equipped themselves with a little "research instrument" worth no more than twenty yuan and lectures from junior agricultural schools. That's all! The conditions of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative are not special at all, and every agricultural cooperative in the country can do it.
    The conditions for carrying out scientific research are indeed indispensable. But some conditions can be created. The farmers of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative, based on their realistic possibilities, created the conditions for carrying out scientific research at present and achieved good research results; the next step is inevitably that, based on the current new conditions, they will create better conditions and will achieve greater research results. Creation after creation, the conditions for them to conduct scientific research will become more and more and better and better.
    If people deviate from realistic possibilities and make excuses that the conditions are not enough without making down-to-earth efforts, then time waits for no one. When farmers in many agricultural cooperatives are making great strides in scientific research, those agricultural cooperatives waiting for conditions will still be blank and still have to sigh in vain.
    The technical revolution is pressing, and the road of scientific research must be taken. To take this road, one cannot be superstitious, nor can one fantasize and wait in vain. Every agricultural cooperative can learn from the experience of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative, learn from the experience of agricultural cooperatives that have already carried out scientific research, and take the first step to embark on the road of scientific research in a simple way, creating conditions for further scientific research.

    条件是可以创造的
    金文
    山东省掖县先锋农业社的社员们在技术革命的进程中，本着“人人学技术，人人懂科学”的方针，使农业科学研究工作在他们那里生了根，对生产起了很大的推动作用。听到这一消息的人们，都为之鼓舞。可是也有人认为，先锋农业社的科学研究成就是有它的特殊条件的。言下之意，别的农业社未必能够做到。
    先锋农业社的条件如何？他们和全国农业社的社员一样，都是极为平凡的农民。他们之中只有八个高小毕业的和读过初中的青年，先锋农业社在技术革新运动中首先把这几个青年培养成了掌握一定科学技术的小土专家。此外，他们置备了价值不超过二十元的一点“研究仪器”和初级农业学校的讲义。如此而已！先锋农业社的条件，丝毫不特殊，全国每一个农业社都是办得到的。
    进行科学研究工作的条件，确实不可少。但是有些条件是可以创造的。先锋农业社的农民们根据他们现实的可能性，创造了目前开展科学研究的条件，取得了很好的研究成果；下一步必然是，他们在目前新的条件的基础上创造出更好的条件，并将取得更大的研究成果。创造复创造，他们进行科学研究的条件会越来越多也越来越好。
    如果人们脱离现实可能，借口条件不够而不作踏实的努力，那么时间不等人，当许多农业社的农民们在科学研究上大步跃进的时候，那种等待条件的农业社将会仍然是空白，仍然只好空叹息。
    技术革命在逼人，科学研究之路非走不可。走这条路，不能迷信，也不能空想空等待。每个农业社都尽可以学习先锋农业社的经验，学习已经开展了科学研究的农业社的经验，迈开步子因陋就简地走上科学研究之路，为进一步的科学研究创造条件。
