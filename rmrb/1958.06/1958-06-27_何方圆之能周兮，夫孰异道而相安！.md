    "How can the square and circle be reconciled? How can those with different paths coexist peacefully!"
    Yesterday (June 26th), the People's Daily published a "Commentator" article on the front page entitled "Trying to Cover Up," commenting on Tito's speech on June 15th. It mentioned that the struggle between Marxists-Leninists and revisionists is inevitable. Because Marxists-Leninists and revisionists cannot coexist, it is not surprising that Tito attacked China madly in his speech. In the article, the commentator quoted two lines from Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" in the Chu Ci: "How can the square and circle be reconciled? How can those with different paths coexist peacefully!"
    These two lines of poetry are from the "Li Sao" in the Chu Ci and serve as a metaphor. They mean that a square and a circle are fundamentally different, so how can they be reconciled? Just as one is straight and the other is curved, how can they live together peacefully?
    The Chu Ci Collection Commentary explains: "Reconciliation means coming together. A round tenon and a square mortise cannot be joined because they have different paths and therefore cannot coexist peacefully." To reconcile means to come together. If we drill a round hole and try to insert a square piece of wood, how can we do that? Because their paths are different, they cannot coexist peacefully. This is an ancient Chinese saying that first appeared in Zhuangzi. Qu Yuan was an upright and pure person. In the preceding passage, he said that he could not abandon principles to accommodate mistakes, and he could not violate the rules to agree with distortions. Therefore, these two sentences express his firm determination to fight against treacherous and evil people (Qu Yuan said these people were "good at debauchery" and "skilled"). So he said indignantly: Who can coexist peacefully with those who have different paths! He sternly condemned these "depraved" people and insisted on his upright position.
    In the "Nine Arguments" chapter of the Chu Ci, there is also the line, "A round mortise and a square tenon, I knew it would be awkward and difficult to insert." This also means the same thing, saying that the square and the circle are incompatible. (Non)

### “何方圆之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安！”

    “何方圆之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安！”
    昨日（6月26日）人民日报一版刊登“本报评论员”评论，以“欲盖弥彰”为题，评铁托6月15日的演说，后面谈到马克思列宁主义者同修正主义者的斗争是不可避免的。因为马克思列宁主义者同修正主义者不能共处，所以铁托在演说中疯狂地攻击中国也就不足为奇。评论员在文章中引了两句屈原的楚辞：“何方圆之能周兮，夫孰异道而相安！”
    这两句诗出在楚辞“离骚”中，是一个比喻，意思是方形与圆形根本不同，又怎么能够互相通融，正如一个是直的、一个是曲的，又怎么能够彼此相安？
    楚辞集注解释道：“周、合也、圆凿方柄不能相合，以其异道故不能相安。”合，是合在一起，假如我们凿一个圆孔，而要把一块方的木头塞进去，那又怎么办得到？因为彼此的道路不同，也就不能相安，这是中国一句古语，最早见于庄子。屈原是一个正直而纯洁的人，在前面一段里，他说他不能舍弃规矩而迁就错误；他不能违背绳墨而附和歪曲，所以这两句话，就是他坚决地要与奸邪之徒（屈原说这些人是“善淫”，是“工巧”）作斗争，所以他愤慨地说：谁能同异道在一起相安！他严厉谴责这些“邪淫”的人，坚持他正直的立场。
    在楚辞九辩一章中，又有“圆凿而方枘兮，吾固知其钼鋙而难入。”也是这个意思，也是说方与圆是格格不入的。（非）
