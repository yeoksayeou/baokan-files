　　The Specific Application of the "Grasp Both Ends" Working Method in Xiangdong Township
　　Li Shujia, First Secretary of the Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangxi Province

    With the deepening development of the rectification campaign and the agricultural production movement, many new topics have been put forward for rural workers. In particular, how the working methods should adapt to the current new situation of the Great Leap Forward has become the central topic that all rural working cadres think about day and night. The vigorous advancement of the agricultural production movement in Xiangdong Township last winter and this spring is the result of adopting various forms of the "grasp both ends" working method, and applying it to all aspects of work along with the deepening development of the rectification campaign and the agricultural production movement.

    Comparison, visits, and on-site meetings are the best forms for the specific application of the "grasp both ends" working method.

    Past working methods were mostly top-down, dealing with matters in isolation, and generally leading. Therefore, the enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses could not be fully utilized. As a result, leaders were distressed and lacked vitality, the masses were dispirited and lacked drive, and the work of the whole township was in a stagnant state. Since the "grasp both ends" working method has been implemented in comparisons, visits, and on-site meetings, cadres have found a way to lead the masses forward, and the masses have found a model for building a new socialist countryside, thereby setting off a revolutionary drive to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and strive to be advanced.

    The specific and systematic application of the "grasp both ends" working method in Xiangdong Township began when the Tuanjie Cooperative completed the "four clean-ups" of winter plowing (plowing the winter water fields clean, clearing the weeds on the field ridges, pulling out the rice stubble, and bagging the deep mud fields) in three days, promoting the completion of the township's "four clean-ups" of winter plowing in seven days, and from the change of the long-standing backward Xingfu Cooperative. Therefore, the "grasp both ends" working method aroused great interest among all members of the Xiangdong Township grassroots Party committee. Then they applied this method to various tasks such as accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects. Just as many township and cooperative cadres in the township lacked the confidence to complete the task of accumulating 140 dan of fertilizer per mu before the Spring Festival, the Xincun Cooperative put forward the slogan of "mountains of people during the day, brightly lit at night," setting off a wave of digging pond mud and topsoil. In just over ten days, 100,000 dan of pond mud were dug, and in just four days, 70,000 dan of topsoil were dug. The township seized this example and immediately organized all township and cooperative cadres to visit the Xincun Cooperative and held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the Xincun Cooperative: "Cadres take the lead (first dig their own fields), make key breakthroughs (concentrate on doing a good job in one team first), and each team emulates (that is, fully promote it)." At the same time, it also analyzed the right-leaning conservative thinking of the Rixin Cooperative, which claimed "no fertilizer can be accumulated" and that "it is not worth the effort." Immediately, a competition between cooperatives was launched. Xingyuan, Shuimei, Wusi, and other seven cooperatives put forward the action slogan: "Fear neither heaven nor earth, determined to surpass the Xincun Cooperative." Since then, a mass campaign of "learning from Xincun, catching up with Xincun, and accumulating 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu" has been launched. Driven by this movement, 500 ponds were completely cleaned out, 5.8 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated, 2.9 million dan of topsoil were dug, and a total of 28 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated, including household fertilizer and other fertilizers, reaching 1,400 dan per mu, more than sixteen times the total fertilizer accumulated in 1957. The Rixin Cooperative, which said that no fertilizer could be accumulated, also basically achieved the target of accumulating 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. The cadres of the Rixin Cooperative said: "Fertilizer sources are everywhere, if you are not afraid to take action." The work of building water conservancy, improving soil, reforming the farming system, and eliminating the four pests has also done many things that predecessors had never done.

    The work of grasping backward cooperatives and weak links is carried out simultaneously with grasping the advanced in the gradual deepening of the production movement. For example, for the Xingfu Cooperative, which was almost collapsing, and the six cooperatives such as the Zhangli Cooperative and the Jimin Cooperative, which lacked drive, their specific situations were studied at the beginning of the movement, the reasons for their backwardness were analyzed, and the method of mass airing of views, mass debates, and major debates was adopted to carry out major debates on the two roads, clarifying why to engage in the Great Leap Forward and what kind of Great Leap Forward to engage in, so that the production progress and ideological awareness of these cooperatives approached the level of advanced cooperatives, changing the previous backward state. The transformation of the Xingfu Cooperative was carried out in this way. This cooperative had sent cadres to rectify it several times, but because the cadres did not go deep enough and did not rely on the majority of the masses, they did not discover the fundamental reason for its backwardness—the production direction was unclear, so it was always in poor condition. At the beginning of the winter production movement last year, Ye Nanliang, the third secretary of the township Party committee, came to this cooperative with two comrades. On the first day they arrived at the cooperative, not a single farmer went to the field (they all went to transport foot fertilizer, make adobe bricks, and engage in individual household sideline occupations), so the three of them worked in the winter plowing field together with two cooperative cadres. They continued like this for three days, and on the fourth day, they led more than 100 farmers to work in the field with them. In this way, they gradually established a relationship with the farmers, and the farmers told the truth. After mass airing of views, mass debates, and major debates, they found that the fundamental reason for the backwardness of the Xingfu Cooperative was that a wealthy middle peasant became the cooperative director and led the farmers on the capitalist road. Once the root cause was found, all problems were easily solved. In addition, the comparison, visits, and on-site meetings spread advanced examples, and the Xingfu Cooperative quickly approached the level of advanced cooperatives under the encouragement of the comparison and competition movement carried out in the township.

    At the beginning of the winter production movement, the low attendance rate of women affected the progress of the entire movement. At this time, the Shuimei Cooperative put forward the slogan of mobilizing "female soldiers" to fight, and the attendance rate of women increased from 30% to more than 70%, which set off a climax in the fertilizer accumulation movement at that time. The township seized this example, summarized and promoted its experience (organized temporary nurseries to solve the problem of unreasonable remuneration), and thus broke through this weak link, making the township's fertilizer accumulation movement quickly set off a climax, increasing from an average of 440 dan of fertilizer per mu to more than 1,200 dan in just over ten days, and at the same time building a water canal three meters wide, two meters deep, and eight li long.

    Through the forms of comparison, visits, and on-site meetings, each cooperative grasps the advanced, and everything has a model, organizing various cooperatives to compete upstream.

    Xiangdong Township's "each cooperative grasps the advanced, and everything has a model" means that no matter whether advanced examples are found in advanced cooperatives, general cooperatives, or backward cooperatives, even if they are small, they are seized as examples and spread and promoted through the forms of comparison, visits, and on-site meetings. This is a fundamental issue of whether a broad mass comparison and competition movement can be launched, and whether various types of cooperatives can be organized to compete upstream—the issue of the mass line. In the past, it was because this fundamental issue was not grasped or not grasped enough, so it often formed a situation where advanced cooperatives were isolated, backward cooperatives were unattended, and general cooperatives could not be managed. Therefore, a deformed state of advanced cooperatives being unconsolidated and backward cooperatives being old and backward appeared. Of course, grasping key points and cultivating the advanced cannot fully exert its due positive role.

    Launching a broad mass comparison and competition movement, organizing all types of cooperatives into the ranks of competing upstream, and consciously taking action, is actually a process of deeply mobilizing the masses and the principle of the mass line must be applied. When the first comparison of the red flag competition in the township was held, the broad masses and most cadres were not very interested, thinking that the Xincun Cooperative was famous in the province, had a case in Beijing, Cooperative Director Peng Guangxian was a famous national model worker, and had met Chairman Mao, so whether it was evaluated or not, the red flag was anyway for the Xincun Cooperative. However, the result of the first comparison was that the first red flag in the township was won by the Tuanjie Cooperative, which was not outstanding in the past, because it did a fast and good job in the "four clean-ups" of winter plowing. The Jimin Cooperative, which had never stood out, improved its production enthusiasm due to the good "five-to-the-hill" work (excavating 32 kinds of fertilizer sources). The Wusi Cooperative, which lacked production experience, was awarded the title of Red Flag Cooperative because of its outstanding sanitation, fertilizer accumulation, and elimination of the four pests, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the general cooperatives to compete upstream. In particular, Daotian Cooperative, whose production had always lagged behind, was praised by the township Party committee for its particularly outstanding work in saving grain, and visits were organized and an on-site meeting was held, which further encouraged the confidence and determination of the backward cooperatives to "catch up with the advanced and strive to be advanced." Zhou Huicai, the secretary of the cooperative's branch, said excitedly: The leadership's actions have made our cadres more active, and the masses are more motivated. Because Xiangdong Township has carried out a comparison and competition movement that takes the mass line and uses living people and living things as models, it not only encourages advanced cooperatives to be more advanced, but also backward cooperatives are secretly trying to show their skills in order to get rid of backwardness. In this way, a high tide of a broad mass socialist great production movement has been launched under the comradely friendship competition of mutual learning and mutual promotion. The words of scolding and jealousy "Down with Peng Guangxian, restore intercropping fields" are no longer heard, but the fighting slogans of "Learn from Xincun, catch up with Xincun" and "Thousands of hearts, thousands of hearts, every heart is towards double thousand jin" are shouted everywhere.

    The Xincun Cooperative, which has always been advanced, is also working diligently and making doubled efforts under the pursuit of other cooperatives to make itself more advanced. In the past, because other cooperatives did not dare to compete with it, the cooperative cadres and members thought that the red flag would not run away anyway, but after the Xincun Cooperative fell behind the Tuanjie Cooperative in the first comparison, Comrade Peng Guangxian, the cooperative director, did not sleep well all night. Especially under the pursuit of Xingyuan and other five cooperatives, it further promoted the enthusiasm of the Xincun Cooperative to learn from others. Comrade Peng Guangxian, the cooperative director, said: There is a change every day now, and I don't know the situation of others in three days. If you walk a little slower, you will fall behind. Under such a situation, the members are not complacent either. Once, the Xincun Cooperative dug 170,000 dan of pond mud, thinking that it was almost enough, but the neighboring Xingyuan Cooperative had already dug 200,000 dan. Only then did they realize that they were behind. But at this time, the pond mud was cleaned out. What should they do? Comrade Peng Guangxian immediately held a forum for old farmers, and everyone came up with ideas. As a result, they found a way to exchange garden soil (replace barren soil with fertile soil). In a few days, they exchanged 870,000 dan of garden soil. In this way, the Xincun Cooperative won the title of Red Flag Cooperative for the fourth comparison. The Xincun Agricultural Cooperative has thus driven all types of cooperatives in the township from imbalance to balance, promoting the great leap forward in socialist production in the process of repeated development.

　　抓两头的工作方法在湘东乡的具体运用
　　中共江西省萍乡县委第一书记　李树家
    随着整风运动和农业生产运动的深入发展，对农村工作者提出了很多新的课题，特别是工作方法如何适应目前大跃进的新形势，就成为所有农村工作干部日思夜虑的中心题目。湘东乡去冬今春农业生产运动的勇猛前进，就是由于它把抓两头的工作方法，采用了多种多样的形式，偕同整风运动和农业生产运动的深入发展，运用到各项工作中去的结果。
    评比、参观、现场会，是具体运用抓两头的工作方法的最好形式。
    过去的工作方法多是上支下派，就事论事的一般化的领导方法，因此广大群众的积极性和智慧不能得到充分发挥，因此领导者苦闷而缺乏生气，群众消沉而干劲不足，致使全乡工作处于停滞不前的局面。自从抓两头的工作方法贯彻到评比、参观、现场会中去后，干部找到了领导群众前进的门路，群众找到了建设社会主义新农村的榜样，从而掀起了学先进、赶先进、争先进的革命干劲。
    湘东乡抓两头的工作方法，具体的系统运用，是从团结社三天完成了冬耕四光（冬水田耕光、田身上的杂草铲光、禾蔸拔光、深泥田包光），推动了全乡冬耕四光七天完成，是从两年来老落后的幸福社改变了落后面貌时开始的。从而抓两头的工作方法，引起了湘东乡基层党委所有成员的很大兴趣，接着他们把这个方法运用到积肥、修水利等各项工作中去了。正当全乡许多乡社干部没有信心在春节前完成每亩一百四十担积肥任务时，新村社提出了“白天人山人海，夜晚灯火通明”的口号，掀起了挖塘泥、挖地皮泥的热潮，仅十几天工夫挖塘泥十万担，仅四天工夫挖地皮泥七万担。乡里就抓住了这个榜样，立即组织了全乡、社干到新村社参观，并举行了现场会，推行了新村社的经验：“干部带头（先挖自己家里的）重点突破（集中先搞好一个队）、各队仿效（即全面推开）”。同时也分析了日新社“无肥可积”和“花不来”的右倾保守思想。当即掀起了社与社之间的竞赛，星源社，水美社，五四社等七个社提出了：“天不怕，地不怕，决心赛过新村社”的行动口号。从此掀起了一个群众性的“学新村，赶新村，每亩积肥十万斤”的评比竞赛运动热潮，在这个运动的推动下，担光挖净了池塘五百口，积肥五百八十万担，挖地皮泥二百九十万担，加上家肥和其它各种肥料共积肥二千八百万担，每亩达到一千四百担，超过了一九五七年全年积肥的十六倍。说无肥可积的日新社，也基本达到了每亩积肥十万斤的指标，日新社的干部说：“肥源到处有，怕你不动手”。兴修水利，改良土壤，改革耕作制度，除四害等方面的工作，也同样地作出了很多前人所从未作到的事情。
    抓落后社、抓薄弱环节的工作，是在生产运动的逐步深入过程中与抓先进的同时进行的，例如几乎垮台的幸福社和干劲不足的樟里社集民社等六个社，在运动的开始就研究了他们的具体情况，分析了他们的落后原因，采取了大鸣大放大辩论的方法，开展了两条道路的大辩论，明确了为什么搞大跃进，搞什么样的大跃进，从而使这些社的生产进度和思想觉悟接近了先进社的水平，改变了以往的落后状态。幸福社的转变，就是这样进行的。这个社曾几次派干部去整顿，都因为干部不深入，没有依靠群众的大多数，而没有发现落后的根本原因——生产方向不明，所以老是搞不好。去年冬季生产运动开始时，该乡党委第三书记叶南良带了两个同志来到了这个社，到社的第一天没有一个农民下田（都去推脚，打土砖，搞个人家庭副业去了），于是他们三个就同两个社干一同下田冬耕，这样连续了三天，到第四天就带动了一百多个农民同他们一起下田了，就这样逐步与农民建立了感情，农民群众说出了真心话，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论之后，找到了幸福社落后的根本原因是：富裕中农当了社主任，引导农民走资本主义道路。根本原因找到了，一切问题迎刃而解，再加上评比、参观、现场会传播了先进事例，幸福社在全乡开展的评比竞赛运动的鼓舞下，很快接近了先进社的水平。
    在冬季生产运动的开始时期，由于妇女出勤率低，影响到整个运动的进展，就在这时水美社提出了发动“娘子兵”上阵的口号，妇女出勤率由百分之三十几，提高到百分之七十以上，使当时的积肥运动掀起了高潮，乡里抓住了这个榜样，总结和推广了他的经验（组织临时托儿所，解决了计酬不合理现象），就这样突破了这个薄弱环节，使全乡的积肥运动迅速地掀起了高潮，由平均每亩四百四十担肥料，十几天的工夫增到一千二百多担，同时修好了一条三米宽、二米深、八华里长的水圳。
    通过评比、参观、现场会的形式，社社抓先进，事事有榜样，组织各类社竞争上游。
    湘东乡的“社社抓先进，事事有榜样”就是：不论在先进社、一般社或后进社中发现了先进的事例，那怕是微小的，都把他抓起来作为榜样，通过评比、参观、现场会的形式把他传播推广出去。这是能否开展起广泛的群众性的评比竞赛运动，能否组织各类社竞争上游的一个根本问题——群众路线问题。过去就是因为对这个带有根本性的问题没有抓住或抓的不够，因此往往形成先进社被孤立、后进社无人管、一般社又管不来的局面，因此呈现出先进的不巩固，后进的老落后的畸形状态。当然抓重点培养先进也就不能充分发挥其应有的积极作用。
    发动起一个广泛的群众性的评比竞赛运动，各种类型的社都组织到竞争上游的行列中去，并自觉地行动起来，这实际上是个深入发动群众的过程，必须运用群众路线的原则。当全乡红旗竞赛的第一次评比时，广大群众和多数干部是不太感兴趣的，认为新村社省里有名，北京有案，社主任彭光贤同志是著名的全国劳模，又见过毛主席，评不评反正红旗是新村社的。但是第一次评比的结果，全乡的第一面红旗被过去并不出色的团结社由于冬耕四光搞的既快又好而得去了，向来不出头露面的集民社因“五到丘”搞的好而提高了生产积极性（挖掘了三十二种肥源），缺乏生产经验的五四社因卫生积肥除四害较为突出而分别获得了红旗社的称号后，大大地鼓舞了一般社竞争上游的积极性。特别是生产一贯落在后面的道田社，仅因节约粮食工作特别出色而受到了乡党委的表扬，并组织了参观和召开了现场会，更鼓舞了后进社“赶先进，争先进”的信心和决心，该社的支部书记周会才兴奋地说：领导上这样做我们干部的积极性更高了，群众的干劲也更大了。湘东乡由于开展了走群众路线的以活人活事为榜样的评比竞赛运动，所以他不仅鼓舞着先进社更先进，就是后进社也在暗中使劲，竭力想露一手以便摆脱落后。这样一来一个广泛的群众性的社会主义大生产运动的高潮，就在互相学习，相互推动的同志式友谊比赛下开展起来了。过去那种谩骂和嫉妒“打倒彭光贤，恢复间作田”的话再也听不到了，而是到处高喊“学新村，赶新村”和“千条心、万条心，条条心向双千斤”的战斗口号。
    历来先进的新村社，在其它社的追赶下也兢兢业业加倍努力，努力使自己更加先进。过去因为别的社不敢和它竞赛，因此社干和社员认为红旗反正跑不掉，但在第一次评比中新村社却落后于团结社之后，社主任彭光贤同志一夜没有睡好，特别是在星源等五个社与他齐头并进的追赶下，更加促进了新村社向别人学习的积极性，社主任彭光贤同志说：现在一天一个变化，三天不知别人的情况，走的稍为慢一点就要落后。在这样一种形势下社员也不自满了。有一次新村社挖塘泥十七万担，认为差不多了，但近邻的星源社已挖了二十万担，这时才知道自己落后了，但这时塘泥挖净了，怎么办呢？彭光贤同志马上召开了老农座谈会，大家想办法，结果找出了换园土（瘦土换肥土）的办法，几天中就换园土八十七万担，这样新村社才又获得了第四次评比的红旗社称号。新村农业社就这样带动了全乡各类社由不平衡到平衡，在反复发展的过程中推动了社会主义生产大跃进。
