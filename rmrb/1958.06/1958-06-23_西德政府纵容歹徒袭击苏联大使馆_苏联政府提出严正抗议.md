Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: According to a TASS report: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko summoned the West German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kroll, on June 21st, to lodge a protest with the West German government regarding the hostile provocation carried out by a group of thugs (approximately 400 people) in Bonn against the Soviet Embassy in Bonn on June 20th with the connivance of the West German authorities.

The Soviet government's protest statement pointed out that the West German official authorities could not have been unaware of this premeditated provocation, because on the eve of the incident, some West German newspapers reported on the planning of a hostile provocation against the Soviet Embassy. The newspapers even published the time of the attack. The Soviet Embassy had drawn the attention of the West German Foreign Ministry to these reports. The West German Foreign Ministry promised to take measures to prevent this hostile attack. However, this was not done in reality. Furthermore, the entire action of the police who came to maintain order showed that the activities of the organizers of the provocation were in fact openly condoned by the police. The statement said that the Soviet government firmly demands that the organizers of the provocation be held accountable and hopes that the West German authorities will take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.

    西德政府纵容歹徒袭击苏联大使馆
    苏联政府提出严正抗议
    新华社22日讯    据塔斯社报道：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯21日召见了西德驻苏大使克罗尔，就波恩一群（约四百人）歹徒在西德当局纵容下于20日对苏联驻波恩大使馆进行敌意挑衅一事，向西德政府提出抗议。
    苏联政府的抗议声明指出，西德官方当局不可能不知道这次预谋的挑衅，因为在事件前夕，一些西德报纸就报道了对苏联大使馆将进行敌意挑衅的策划情况。报纸甚至还公布了这次挑衅袭击的动手时间。苏联大使馆曾经提请西德外交部注意这些消息。西德外交部答应将采取措施防止这种敌意袭击。然而，事实上并没有这样做。此外，前来维持秩序的警察的全部行动表明，挑衅组织者的活动实际上是受到了警察公开的纵容。声明说，苏联政府坚决要求追究挑衅组织者的责任，并且希望西德当局采取必要措施，防止将来再发生类似事件。
