Yongkang Peasants' New Creation
    Using Small Ponds to Brew Artificial Urine

(Reported by this newspaper) Since the spring fertilizer accumulation movement, Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, has vigorously promoted the production of artificial urine. Up to now, a total of 444,821,000 *dan* have been brewed, accounting for 60% of the county's total fertilizer accumulation.

The artificial urine was first successfully trial-produced in Qianhuang Cooperative, Qiaoxia Township, in this county. The method is very simple: small ponds on the edges of fields and corners of the land are used as urine pools, and tree leaves, green grass, green manure, manure, lime, or ferrous sulfate are placed in the pool to make it rot. In hot weather, it can all rot into liquid quick-acting fertilizer in twenty days. The fertilizer efficiency is as high as that of human urine, and the general fertilizer efficiency is more than one-third that of human urine. The proportion of ingredients is 100 *dan* of water plus 10 *dan* of tree leaves, green grass, or green manure, 1 *dan* of manure, 1 *dan* of human manure, and 1.5 *jin* of ferrous sulfate. After the raw materials are placed, they are sealed to prevent fertilizer dispersion and rainwater from entering. Artificial urine is used in rice paddies with good results. In Lidian Cooperative, Lidian Township, this county, there were four *mu* of backward seedlings. After applying 80 *dan* of artificial urine, the seedlings grew tender, green, and vigorous in ten days, improving to first-class seedlings. In Rongfeng Cooperative's small farm, Gushan Town, there were two and a half *mu* of third-class seedlings that had been flooded. After applying 300 *dan* of artificial urine, they turned green in five days.

The Yongkang County Party Committee recently comprehensively summarized the experience of manufacturing artificial urine, believing that the following points should also be noted in future promotion: ① Small ponds, high-banked ponds, and stagnant water ponds can be used to brew artificial urine, while large ponds, ponds near streams, and ponds with flowing water are not suitable for brewing artificial urine; ② Combine fertilizer production with fertilizer application to prevent production without use, wasting raw materials; Rationally select the location of artificial urine ponds to save fertilizer transportation labor; ③ Promote artificial urine pits to improve fertilizer quality.

    永康农民新创造
    利用小塘沤制人造尿
    本报讯  浙江省永康县从春季积肥运动当中就大力推广制造人造尿，到目前为止，一共沤制了四亿四千八百二十一万担，占全县积肥总数的60％。
    人造尿是这县桥下乡前黄社首先试制成功的。制法很简单，利用田边、地角的小塘当尿池，把树叶、青草、绿肥、栏肥、石灰或绿矾放在池里使它腐烂。天热二十天就能全部发烂成为液体速效肥料。肥效高的相当于人尿，一般的也有人尿三分之一以上的肥效。配料比例是一百担水加树叶、青草或绿肥十担，栏肥一担，人粪一担，绿矾一斤半。原料放好后就进行封闭，防止肥分散失和雨水冲进。人造尿用到水稻田里，效果比较好。这县李店乡李店社有四亩落后苗，施上八十担人造尿，十天后秧苗就长得嫩绿旺盛，提高为一类苗。古山镇荣丰社小农场有被水淹过的二亩半三类苗，施上三百担人造尿，五天就转青。
    永康县委最近又全面总结了制造人造尿的经验，认为今后推广中还要注意以下几点：①小塘、高沿塘、死水塘可以沤制人造尿，大塘、靠溪的塘、有流水的塘不宜沤制人造尿；②造肥与用肥结合，防止造而不用，浪费原料；合理选定人造尿塘的地点，节省运肥劳动力；③推广人造尿坑，提高肥料质量。
