Column: Singing the General Line

    Short Song
    Li Guangtian
    Sing "Red Flag" Where is the red flag? The red flag is here, the red flag is in hand, the red flag is in the heart. Who holds the great banner? The Chinese Communist Party. The flag bearer walks in front, and the masses follow. The red flag opens the avenue, the sun shines in the sky, realizing the general line, leaping again and again. Boost your energy, always strive for the top, more, faster, better and more economical, a sea of ​​happiness flows.
    Compare and see how narrow-minded intellectuals are, "zhī hū zhě yě" obscures the sky, conceited and inferior, twisting and turning with a sour taste. If you have knowledge, you must be capable. If knowledge is useless, it is in vain. Separating from reality is foolish, and separating from the masses is lonely. Try comparing with workers and peasants, who takes the lead in creation and invention? Champions emerge from labor, one day is better than twenty years. Open your eyes and look carefully, work together with workers and peasants, don't be blind, don't stand by idly!
    Eradicate Capitalism and Promote Socialism, Look at the heroes of today, today you should understand: Collectivism has many methods, individualism is terrible! Chairman has long taught that intellectuals must be reformed. The fundamental problem lies in the stand, and contact with workers and peasants is good medicine. Overcoming one hurdle after another, the most important hurdle now is, anti-rightist, anti-corruption, hand over your heart, the road to being both red and expert is just one. Eradicating capitalism and promoting socialism starts from the heart, burning the idea of ​​fame and profit from the root, from now on take a firm new stand, and plant deep roots that cannot be shaken.

专栏：歌唱总路线

    短歌
    李广田
    歌“红旗”红旗在哪里？红旗在这里，红旗在手里，红旗在心里。大旗谁执掌？中国共产党。旗手前边走，万众齐跟上。红旗开大道，太阳当空照，实现总路线，飞跃再飞跃。干劲要鼓足，永远争上游，多快又好省，幸福大海流。
    比比看知识分子眼不宽，“之乎者也”遮了天，自高自大又自卑，扭扭捏捏滋味酸。有了知识要能干，知识无用是枉然，脱离实际大傻瓜，脱离群众孤单单。试和工农比比看，创造发明谁占先？劳动之中出状元，一天胜过二十年。睁开大眼仔细看，要和工农一齐干，不要有眼看不见，不要袖手旁边站！
    灭资兴无英雄人物看今朝，今朝总该明白了：集体主义办法多，个人主义真糟糕！主席早已有教导，知识分子须改造，根本问题在立场，接触工农是良药。一关一关闯过了，当前一关最重要，反右，双反，把心交，红专大路只一条。灭资兴无从心起，名利思想从根烧，从今站定新立场，扎下深根莫动摇。
