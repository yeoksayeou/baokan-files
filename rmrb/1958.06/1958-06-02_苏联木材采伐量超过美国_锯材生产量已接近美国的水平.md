Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet Union's timber logging volume has surpassed that of the United States. As early as 1956, the Soviet Union's timber logging was already 8% higher than the U.S. Sawn timber production in the Soviet Union is also rapidly approaching U.S. levels.

The Soviet Union possesses the largest reserves of harvestable timber in the world. Its forest area covers 1,131,000,000 hectares, averaging more than 5.6 hectares per person. The forest resources of Siberia, the Far East, and the northern regions account for 90% of the Soviet Union's total forest resources, while the timber logging in these areas currently only accounts for 42% of the Soviet Union's total timber logging volume.

According to the seven-year plan currently being formulated, the timber logging volume in the Siberian, Far Eastern, and northern regions of the Soviet Union will greatly increase between 1959 and 1965. The new logging enterprises built in these regions during this period will be able to log at least 120 million cubic meters of timber annually.

    苏联木材采伐量超过美国
    锯材生产量已接近美国的水平
    据新华社讯　苏联的木材采伐量已经超过美国。苏联的木材采伐量还在1956年就已经比美国多8％。苏联的锯材生产量目前也正在迅速接近美国的水平。
    苏联可采伐的木材的蓄积量居世界第一位。它的森林面积达十一亿三千一百万公顷，按人口平均计算为五点六公顷以上。西伯利亚、远东地区和北部地区的森林资源占全苏联森林资源的90％，而这些地区的木材采伐量目前只占到苏联全国木材总采伐量的42％。
    根据目前正在制订的七年远景计划，在1959年到1965年期间，苏联西伯利亚、远东地区和北部地区的木材采伐量将大大增加，这些地区在这个期间新建的伐木企业每年最少可以采伐一亿二千万立方公尺的木材。
