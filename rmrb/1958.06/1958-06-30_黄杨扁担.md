    Yellow Yang Handle
    Liang Shangquan
    A yellow yang handle gleams,
    Carrying white rice down to Fuzhou;
    Everyone says white rice is good,
    White rice comes from mountain gullies—
    This year, barren slopes are turned into terraced fields,
    The carrying pole has moved several mountains;
    Several great mountains have all been moved,
    The white rice produced is inexhaustible!
    Thousands are mobilized to carry it out,
    Thousands of carrying poles form a line;
    Today, white rice is carried into the city,
    Tomorrow, cars will drive into the mountains!

    黄杨扁担
    梁上泉黄杨扁担闪悠悠，挑挑白米下涪州；人人都说白米好，白米出在山沟沟——今年荒坡改梯田，扁担挑走几座山；几座大山都挑走，出的白米运不完！千人出动往外搬，千条扁担一条线；今天白米挑进城，明天汽车开进山！
