Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: Just as the Chiang Kai-shek clique was being discredited in Indonesia for its involvement with the Indonesian rebel groups, the United States has directed the Liao Wenyi group of the so-called "Taiwan Independence League," which it keeps in Tokyo, to send people to Indonesia to carry out activities, attempting to undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and taking the opportunity to promote the US plot to legalize the occupation of Taiwan.

A member of the Liao Wenyi group named Chen Zhixiong publicly appeared in Jakarta on June 5th. He claimed to be the "special envoy" of the Liao Wenyi group stationed in Southeast Asia and was ordered to open an "office" in Jakarta.

Chen Zhixiong said that he was surprised that no one in Indonesia knew about the so-called "Free Taiwan Movement" promoted by the Liao Wenyi group. He said that Japan, the United States, and Britain had "already" known about this "movement." He particularly pointed out that the fact that the headquarters of the Liao Wenyi group is located in Tokyo shows that it has already received the support of the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi.

The Liao Wenyi group is a tool used by the United States in a conspiracy to undermine China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan. The head of this group, Liao Wenyi, has long surrendered to American imperialism and Japanese militarism, acting as their running dog and special agent. Liao Wenyi was originally a large landlord in southern Taiwan. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, he colluded with the Japanese authorities to oppress the Taiwanese people. At the same time, Liao Wenyi had early relations with the United States, studied in the United States, married an American wife, and participated in the American intelligence agency. When the Chinese People's Liberation War was victoriously developing, the United States directed Liao Wenyi to carry out activities to demand that the United Nations "trusteeship Taiwan." When the United States launched the Korean War in 1950, Liao Wenyi became more active in coordinating with the US action to occupy Taiwan. Under the manipulation of the US government and the protection of the Japanese government, the Liao Wenyi group, composed of a small group of scum, established the so-called "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" in Tokyo on February 28, 1956, to create a basis for the long-term US occupation of Taiwan. At the end of 1957, the US-Japanese reactionaries smuggled members of the Liao Wenyi group to Cairo through the Japanese delegation attending the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, attempting to create "two Chinas" in the conference. After this shameful act was exposed, members of the Liao Wenyi group were driven out of Cairo in disgrace.

    美国指使廖文毅集团分子到雅加达活动
    为美国侵占台湾合法化阴谋作宣传
    新华社8日讯　正当蒋介石集团因为参与印度尼西亚叛乱集团的活动在印度尼西亚已经被搞臭了的时候，美国竟然指使设在东京的为它豢养的所谓“台湾独立同盟”的廖文毅集团派人到印度尼西亚去进行活动，企图破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系，竟乘机为美国侵占台湾合法化的阴谋作宣传。
    一个名叫陈志雄的廖文毅集团分子6月5日公开在雅加达出现。他自称是廖文毅集团派驻东南亚的“特使”，并且受命在雅加达开设“办事处”。
    陈志雄说，他听到在印度尼西亚没有人知道廖文毅集团搞的所谓“自由台湾运动”，觉得很奇怪。他说，日本、美国和英国早已“知道”这个“运动”了。他特别指出，廖文毅集团的总部设在东京这一事实表明，它已经得到日本岸信介政府的支持。
    廖文毅集团是美国阴谋用来破坏中国对台湾的领土主权的工具。这个集团的首脑廖文毅很早以前就投靠美帝国主义和日本军国主义，充当它们的走狗和特务。廖文毅本来是台湾南部的大地主，在日本统治台湾时期，和日本当局勾结，欺压台湾人民。同时，廖文毅在早期就和美国发生关系，曾到美国“留学”，娶了美国老婆，并且参加了美国的间谍机关。当中国人民解放战争胜利开展的时候，美国指使廖文毅进行了要求联合国“托管台湾”的活动。当美国在1950年发动侵朝战争的时候，廖文毅更加积极活动，来配合美国侵占台湾的行动。在美国政府的操纵和日本政府的包庇下，由一小撮败类组成的廖文毅集团在1956年2月28日在东京成立了所谓“台湾共和国临时政府”，为美国长期占领台湾制造根据。1957年底，美日反动派通过日本出席亚非人民团结大会的代表团把廖文毅集团分子挟带到开罗，企图在大会中制造“两个中国”的活动。这种可耻的行径遭到揭露后，廖文毅集团分子狼狈地被赶出了开罗。
