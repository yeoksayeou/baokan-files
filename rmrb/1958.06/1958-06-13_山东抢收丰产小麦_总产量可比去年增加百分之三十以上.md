    Shandong Rushes to Harvest Bumper Wheat Crop
    Total Yield Expected to Increase by More Than 30% Compared to Last Year
    Jinan, June 12 (reporter Ai Yun) -- Shandong province's sixty million mu of wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, and the entire province is mobilized to fully engage in the rush harvest.
    Currently, the wheat harvest is in full swing in the Lu-Northwest Plain and the Yimeng Mountain area of central and southern Shandong, where the wheat matures earlier. The wheat harvest has also begun in the western part of the Laiyang area, where the wheat matures later. By the 11th, nearly twenty million mu of wheat had been harvested throughout the province. According to actual threshing results from various places, the total wheat yield of the province this year is expected to increase by more than 30% compared to last year, and in some areas it may increase by 50% or even double. The yield increase is even more significant in the twenty million mu of high-yield wheat fields, which account for one-third of the province's total wheat area. Among them, 2.69 million mu can achieve an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu, and more than 100,000 mu can achieve a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. The four areas of Jining, Heze, Linyi, and Tai'an, which suffered severe drought and flood disasters last autumn, have achieved a historically rare bumper harvest this year. According to various analyses, the total output of more than seven million mu of wheat in the entire area this year can reach 1.4 billion jin. The wheat yield in the entire area increased by about 65% compared to last year's 118 jin per mu. Linyi Prefecture, which overcame several instances of frost damage and insect pests, has achieved its largest harvest in fifty years and will see a new record of 1,000 jin per mu for the first time in the prefecture.
    In order to ensure a fast and good harvest, party secretaries at all levels in the province took the lead, and the party, government, army, and people went all out to engage in the rush harvest struggle. On the 8th, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, and Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Secretariat, and other responsible persons harvested the wheat from their own experimental fields. They estimate that their experimental fields can produce about 1,000 jin per mu. Units in Shandong Province and Jinan City, as well as troops stationed in Jinan, have dispatched 10,000 to 20,000 people daily to help the masses with the rush harvest. People in various places have demonstrated the spirit of socialist cooperation during the wheat harvest. Farmers in areas where the wheat matures later and areas with less land and more people have taken the initiative to organize themselves to support the wheat harvesting work in areas with more land and fewer people. Teng County, a mountainous area with little wheat planting, organized more than 1,000 laborers and more than 100 small carts to support the plain areas with more wheat planting. In addition, industrial and commercial departments have also actively supported the wheat harvest.
    During the rush harvest, agricultural cooperatives in various places paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain returns home. In the case of labor shortages, many townships and cooperatives have come up with many specific methods, such as collective milling, collective cooking, and widespread organization of childcare organizations, to solve the problem of labor shortages.

### 山东抢收丰产小麦  总产量可比去年增加百分之三十以上

    山东抢收丰产小麦
    总产量可比去年增加百分之三十以上
    本报济南12日电　记者艾蕴报道：山东省六千万亩小麦今年获得空前大丰收，全省总动员全力投入抢收。
    目前，小麦成熟期较早的鲁西北大平原和鲁中南的沂蒙山区收割已进入高潮；小麦成熟较晚的莱阳专区西部麦收也已开始。到11日，全省收割小麦已近两千万亩。根据各地打场的实际结果来看，今年全省小麦总产量可比去年增产30％以上，有的可增产50％甚至一倍左右。占全省麦田总面积三分之一的两千万亩小麦丰产田，产量提高得更加显著。其中有二百六十九万亩平均亩产可达五百斤以上，有十万余亩亩产可达一千斤以上。去秋遭受严重水旱灾害的济宁、菏泽、临沂、泰安等四个专区的小麦，今年获得了历史上罕见的大丰收。据各方分析，今年全区七百多万亩小麦，总产量可达十四亿斤。全区小麦比去年每亩一百一十八斤增产65％左右。战胜数次冻害和虫灾的临沂专区，今年获得了五十年来未有的大丰收，并将在全区内第一次出现亩产千斤的新纪录。
    为了保证收快收好，全省各级党委书记挂帅，党政军民全力以赴地投入抢收斗争。8日，中共山东省委第一书记舒同和书记处书记谭启龙等负责人收割了自己试验田的小麦。他们种的试验田，估计每亩可产千斤左右。山东省、济南市各单位和驻济南部队连日出动一万到两万多人帮助群众抢收。各地人民在麦收中发扬了社会主义的协作精神。成熟较晚和地少人多的地区的农民，主动组织起来支援地多人少的地区的麦收工作。滕县种麦少的山区组织一千多个劳动力和百余辆小车，支援种麦多的平原地区。此外，工业和商业部门也积极主动支援麦收。
    在抢收中，各地农业社都注意了精收细打，保证颗粒还家。在劳力不足的情况下，不少乡、社都想出了许多具体办法，如集体磨面、集体做饭烧水、广泛组织托儿组织等，以解决劳动力不足的问题。（附图片）
