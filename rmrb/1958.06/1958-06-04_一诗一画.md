    A Poem and a Painting
　　Poem by Zuo Hai, Painting by Huang Zhou
　　Stars fill the sky, their reflections crisscrossing, traveling north of the mountains and east of the river at midnight.
　　Far and near, people praise the girl on the donkey's back, a youth team leader and a doctor as well.

    一诗一画
　　左海诗  黄胄画
　　满天星斗影纵横，岭北河东夜半行。
　　远近争夸驴背女，青年队长又医生。
