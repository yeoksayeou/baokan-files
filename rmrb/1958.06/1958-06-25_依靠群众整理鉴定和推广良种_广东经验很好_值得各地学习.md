Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 24th: The national seed work visiting delegation organized by the Ministry of Agriculture has decided to launch a nationwide campaign to learn from and promote Guangdong Province's successful experience in popularizing improved varieties by adopting the mass line.

From the beginning of sorting out and utilizing farmers' varieties to the regional variety identification and large-scale propagation and promotion carried out to determine which areas the varieties were suitable for planting, Guangdong Province has relied on the masses at every step. When sorting out rice varieties began in 1956, the province trained more than 60,000 farmer seed technicians and organized a team of more than 500,000 people to evaluate good varieties. Within that year, the province sorted out more than 6,700 varieties, of which 169 were identified as excellent varieties. While sorting out varieties, they simultaneously investigated and evaluated good varieties, and mobilized agricultural cooperatives to formulate improved variety promotion plans, launching a large-scale seed selection, seed retention, and seed exchange movement, thus achieving basic popularization of improved varieties throughout the province in 1957. On the basis of completing the sorting of the main variety—rice—in 1957, they then carried out mass sorting of sweet potato, wheat, peanut, and other varieties.

In carrying out regional variety identification work, the relevant departments in Guangdong Province boldly handed the work over to the agricultural cooperatives and also formed a regional identification network to quickly grasp the adaptability and characteristics of new varieties. Now, all key agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have experimental farms and experimental plots. In addition to conducting high-yield experiments, these experimental plots also conduct regional variety identification and variety comparison. They also have specially designated seed retention fields as their own seed selection bases, and they have formed professional seed teams specifically responsible for the cooperative's improved variety propagation work.

When the national seed work visiting delegation proposed promoting Guangdong Province's seed work experience nationwide, it also requested that all regions do the following to adapt the improved variety promotion work to the development of the current agricultural leap forward.

One, conduct a general variety evaluation and review. Before the summer and autumn harvest season this year, all provinces and cities should conduct a general variety evaluation and review to identify variety distribution, superior and inferior varieties, field types, and cultivation techniques, and promptly utilize the good varieties after evaluation. Two, learn from Guangdong's experience and carry out mass regional variety identification work. Each county can choose three to five representative agricultural cooperatives to set up experimental points, and each point can set up one or two sub-points, to achieve "many points, wide coverage." During the trial period, it is even more important to organize the masses to visit and evaluate, and to conduct reviews at the county level. Three, do a good job in farm propagation of improved varieties. According to the principle of "propagating improved varieties and demonstrating increased production," farms should truly become improved variety propagation bases and play a core role for agricultural cooperatives. Four, improve the agricultural cooperative's seed selection and retention system. Agricultural cooperatives should establish seed organizations to take charge of the cooperative's seed work. Generally, it is required to establish seed teams to be specifically responsible for seed retention fields and other work. It is required that the seeds used for planting in seed retention fields be selected from ears before sowing as much as possible. Cooperatives with the conditions should establish experimental farms within the cooperative this year. Five, actively cultivate farmer seed selectors. As much as possible, their materials should be compiled into booklets of farmer seed selectors by province.

    依靠群众整理鉴定和推广良种
    广东经验很好　值得各地学习
    据新华社广州24日电　由农业部组织的全国种子工作参观团决定在全国掀起学习和推广广东省采取走群众路线的工作方法普及良种的成功经验。
    广东省从开始整理和利用农家品种到为摸清品种适应种植地区而进行的品种区域鉴定和大量繁殖推广工作，都是一环扣着一环地依靠群众进行的。1956年开始整理水稻品种时，这个省就训练出六万多农民种子技术员，并组织了五十多万人的评选良种工作队伍。在这一年内，全省整理出六千七百多个品种，其中发掘出一百六十九个优良品种。整理品种时，一面调查评选良种，一面发动农业社制订良种推广计划，开展了大规模的选种、留种和换种运动，因而在1957年全省基本做到良种普及。在完成整理主要品种——水稻的基础上，1957年接着又进行了群众性的整理甘薯、小麦、花生等品种的工作。
    在进行品种区域鉴定工作时，广东省有关部门放手地交给农业社去做，还组成区域鉴定网，迅速掌握了新品种的适应性和特性。现在，广东省内各个重点农业社都有了试验场和试验田，这些试验田除了作丰产试验外，还进行品种区域鉴定和品种比较。他们还特别设有留种田，作为自己的选种基地，并且组成专业种子队，专门负责全社的良种繁殖工作。
    全国种子工作参观团提出在全国推广广东省的种子工作经验时，还要求各地做好下列几项工作，使良种推广工作适应当前农业大跃进形势的发展。
    一、普遍进行一次品种评比复查工作。各省市在今年夏秋收获季节之前普遍开展一次品种评选复查工作，查清品种分布、优种劣种、田类和栽培技术，评选良种后及时加以利用。二、学习广东省的经验，开展群众性的品种区域鉴定工作。各县可以选择三、五个有代表性的农业社设立试验点，各点再设一二个附点。做到“点多、面广”。试验期中，更要组织群众参观评选，以县为单位进行审定。三、做好农场繁殖良种工作。根据“繁殖良种、增产示范”的方针，使农场真正成为良种繁殖基地，对农业社起核心作用。四、健全农业社选种留种制度。农业社建立种子组织，掌握全社的种子工作，一般要求能建立起种子队，专责搞留种田等工作。留种田播用的种子尽可能在播种前提倡穗选。要求有条件的合作社今年在社内建立试验农场。五、积极培养农民选种家。尽可能把他们的材料，以省为单位，编印农民选种家的小册子。
