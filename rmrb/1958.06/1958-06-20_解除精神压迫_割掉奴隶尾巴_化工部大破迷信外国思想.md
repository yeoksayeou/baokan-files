Eliminate Spiritual Oppression, Cut off the Tail of Slavery
Ministry of Chemical Industry Breaks Down Superstition of Foreign Thought

(Our newspaper reporter Yuan Mu reports) Using the general line of socialist construction as its ideological weapon, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has mobilized all personnel in the rectification movement to resolutely break down superstition and vigorously liberate thought. After a month of debate, the ministry has begun to see a new situation in which everyone is involved in summing up the creative experiences of the working masses, and everyone is offering advice and suggestions.

This great debate shows that if the slavish ideology of worshipping foreign countries is not eliminated among the staff, especially the technical staff, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses cannot be further brought into play. Prior to this, in order to rapidly promote the blooming of chemical plants everywhere, the Ministry of Chemical Industry had asked various design institutes to produce standard designs for various types of small chemical plants as soon as possible. At that time, some technical personnel believed that the development trend of the chemical industry in various countries was "from small to large, from decentralized to centralized." Now, they were being asked to bring concentrated modern technology to the countryside, which was "unthinkable." Based on this situation, during the "Eighth National Congress" meeting, the leaders of the ministry, in accordance with the main spirit of the "Eighth National Congress," promptly made an in-depth mobilization report on rectification to all personnel, calling on everyone to liberate themselves from the ideological shackles of blindly believing in foreign countries and belittling themselves.

The mass in-depth exposure fully shows that the slavish ideology of worshipping foreign countries and despising one's own is a serious ideological obstacle to further promoting the great leap forward in production and construction. Some veteran technical personnel are submissive to Western capitalist countries, almost to the point of idol worship. Last year, Chinese chemical researchers successfully developed a new method of manufacturing phosphoric acid using the "semi-water process." Although the Basic Chemical Design Institute of the ministry had sent people to see it in person and witnessed that the phosphoric acid produced by this method was of high quality and could reduce a production section, some key engineers of the design institute still expressed doubts about this new technology. Their only reason was that other countries had not used this method. There is also this incident: The Chemical Research Institute needed a grinding wheel. Someone sent a high-quality domestic grinding wheel, but the technical personnel of the institute repeatedly shook their heads, believing that domestic products could not be used and insisted on replacing it with a foreign product. The person who sent the grinding wheel sent the original item again a few days later, claiming it was an "imported product." As a result, after they used it, they repeatedly praised it, believing that "imported products" were still the most effective.

People whose minds are poisoned to such an extent will inevitably despise the creations of the working masses. Although the quality and material consumption quota of 666 insecticide powder made in China have jumped to the world's top level, some engineers of the Production Department and Nitrogen Fertilizer Design Institute of the ministry believe that this is impossible under the conditions of backward production equipment in China. They even suspected that the factory had made a wrong assessment. Not long ago, a chemical plant in Shanghai proposed a production method that could greatly reduce the cost of fertilizer. When the Ministry of Chemical Industry assigned an engineer to study this issue, the engineer rarely consulted with the masses, but only consulted many reference books from capitalist countries. From there, he concluded that "foreign countries have not done this," so he believed that "there is no scientific theoretical basis." Even after the factory had successfully tested it and put it into production, the engineer had not completely dispelled his doubts.

In this ideological struggle, the Leading Group for Rectification of the Ministry of Chemical Industry emphasized further eliminating the bourgeois stand and national inferiority complex politically, and eliminating the mystical viewpoint technologically, so as to combine establishment and elimination, and promote the combination of politics and technology. In one month, the ministry, combining the mass in-depth exposure and criticism, organized all personnel to discuss the long-term plan for the chemical industry to quickly catch up with all capitalist countries, and deeply publicized the leap forward situation that is currently appearing in all aspects. In order to break down the mystical viewpoint on technology, all personnel also visited the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, listened to the report of termite expert Li Shimei, organized technical personnel from various units to participate in the summary of experience in running the chemical industry with indigenous methods in various places, and at the same time, in various units, typical examples of technically building cars behind closed doors, being divorced from the masses and reality, were deeply criticized. This has raised the awareness of the masses and inspired their courage to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. An engineer who had received many years of education in Germany in his early years confessed that he had regarded himself as a "German faction" for many years. When German fascists failed in World War II, he actually believed that he had lost his "backer" and expressed regret. When he recently talked about the residual influence of this kind of thinking that completely lost the stand of the Chinese people, he felt very painful. After many technical personnel deeply discussed the industrial construction policy of combining large, medium and small sizes in the spirit of the general line, they began to criticize the erroneous view that "foreign" methods were advanced and "indigenous" methods were backward. The inorganic salt industry plays an important role in the development of cutting-edge science and technology. At present, China is still very backward in this area. Many technical personnel in the ministry originally lacked confidence in quickly catching up with capitalist countries in the inorganic salt industry. Recently, after investigation and understanding, they found that the metal sodium and metal calcium produced by indigenous methods in Beijing have reached the international level, and the country has been able to produce certain varieties of inorganic salts. This situation has enhanced their confidence. Recently, they are searching for indigenous methods to strengthen research to ensure that factory designs for the production of eighty-five varieties of inorganic salts are provided from mid-June to the end of July.

In the past month, the slavish ideology of worshipping foreign countries has been discredited. Everyone has risen up to cut off the tail of slavery, and a new atmosphere of everyone respecting the experience of the masses, attaching importance to "indigenous methods," and daring to boldly conceive has begun to appear throughout the ministry. At the beginning of this month, more than 40 engineering and technical personnel from four departments and three design institutes, with a revolutionary spirit of shock attack, spent only two days summarizing 61 kinds of mass experiences in using indigenous methods to produce chemical fertilizers, acids and alkalis, inorganic salts, organic chemical products, rubber and pharmaceutical products in various places, and published a "Reference Materials for the Whole People to Run the Chemical Industry" for various places to promote according to specific circumstances. Since late May, more than 100 important technical innovation initiatives have been proposed by various units, many of which were previously unthinkable, and even problems that other countries in the world have not solved. The engineers of the Rubber Department are studying the use of high-frequency current to vulcanize rubber, so that the original vulcanization time of 140 to 160 minutes is shortened to 7 to 15 minutes. Someone in the Pharmaceutical Department proposed to use solid fermentation to produce livestock antibiotics for use by agricultural cooperatives. More than a dozen young technical personnel from the Chemical Research Institute are studying how to establish small factories in counties and townships to produce synthetic fibers such as perchloroethylene using indigenous methods. For the standardized design of various small chemical plants that provide conditions for the rapid development of the local chemical industry, people have now generally established a new guiding ideology of "if you want to be fast, you must use less steel, and if you want more, farmers must be able to do it and villages must be able to run it," and are striving to carry out various designs that are more in line with actual needs based on this ideology. The Basic Chemical Design Institute spent three days designing a small factory for producing sulfuric acid by indigenous methods, with an annual output of 80 tons of sulfuric acid, which can be used to make 200 tons of phosphate fertilizer. This design uses pottery jars and wooden foot-operated blowers exhibited at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition to completely replace steel equipment. The total investment is only 1,600 yuan, and the investment can be recovered in about 40 days as long as it is put into production. The designers of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Design Institute are also designing a small nitrogen fertilizer plant that can be run by agricultural cooperatives. This design will strive to use local materials and reduce investment to ensure that all investment can be recovered several months after the factory is put into production. The technical personnel responsible for the design of the alkali-making industry spent three days rushing to produce four "indigenous" designs including six kinds of products. These designs do not use electricity, and the investment is only one-third to one-hundredth of that of "foreign" methods. (Attached picture)

    解除精神压迫　割掉奴隶尾巴
    化工部大破迷信外国思想
    本报讯　记者袁木报道：化学工业部以社会主义建设总路线作为思想武器，在整风运动中动员全部人员坚决破除迷信，大力解放思想。经过一个月的辩论，这个部已开始出现了人人动手总结劳动群众的创造经验，人人出谋划策的新局面。
    这一场大辩论表明，如果不在工作人员特别是技术人员中破除迷信外国的奴隶思想，就不能更进一步发挥群众的积极性和创造性。在这以前，化工部为了迅速促进化工厂遍地开花，曾向各个设计院提出尽快做出各类小型化工厂的定型设计，当时有些技术人员就认为世界各国化学工业的发展趋势都是“由小到大，由分散到集中”，现在却要求集中现代化技术的化学工业下乡，这是“不能设想的事情”。根据这种情况，这个部的领导人在“八大”会议期间，就根据“八大”的主要精神及时向全部人员作了一次深入整风的动员报告，号召大家从迷信外国妄自菲薄的思想束缚中解放出来。
    经过群众性的深入揭发，充分表明迷信外国鄙视自己的奴隶思想，是进一步促进生产建设大跃进的严重思想障碍。有些老技术人员对西方资本主义国家甘拜下风，几乎到了偶像崇拜的程度。我国化工研究人员在去年已经研究成功用“半水法”制造磷酸的新方法，这个部的基本化学设计院虽已派人实地看过，亲眼见到利用这种方法所生产的磷酸质量高，并且可以减少一个生产工段，但设计院的一些主要工程师仍然对这种新技术表示怀疑，他们唯一的理由就是别的国家还没有用过这种方法。还有这样一件事情：化工研究院需要一个砂轮，有人把一个国产的质量很高的砂轮送去，这个院的技术人员连连摇头，认为国产的不能使用，定要换外国货，送砂轮的人过了几天又将原物送去，推说是“进口货”，结果他们使用之后便连声称赞起来，认为还是“进口货”顶用。
    思想中毒到如此程度的人，必然鄙视劳动群众的创造。我国制造的666药粉的质量和材料消耗定额虽都已跃居世界头等地位，但这个部的生产司和氮肥设计院的一些工程师，却认为在我国生产设备落后的条件下这是不可能的事情，他们甚至还怀疑是工厂里鉴定错误。不久前，上海一个化工厂提出一种可以使化肥成本大大降低的生产方法，当化工部指定一位工程师去研究这个问题时，这位工程师很少同群众商量，只去翻阅许多资本主义国家的参考书籍，从那里，他得出的结论是“外国没有这样做过”，因此认为“没有科学理论根据”。直到工厂里已经试验成功进行生产以后，这位工程师还没有完全打消他的怀疑态度。
    在这场思想斗争中，化工部整风领导小组强调进一步从政治上破除资产阶级立场和民族自卑感，从技术路线上破除神秘观点，做到边立边破，以立带破，进一步促进政治与技术的结合。一个月中，这个部结合着群众的深入揭发和批判，同时组织全体人员讨论了化学工业迅速赶上一切资本主义国家的远景规划，深入地宣传了目前在各方面出现的跃进形势。为了打破技术上的神秘观点，全部人员还参观了全国农具展览会，听取了白蚁专家李始美的报告，组织各单位技术人员参加对各地土法办化学工业的经验总结，同时在各个单位对一些在技术上闭门造车脱离群众脱离实际的典型事例，进行了深入的批判。这样就提高了群众的觉悟，激发了群众敢想敢说敢做的勇气。有一位早年在德国受过多年教育的工程师，检查出他多年来就以“德国派”自居，德国法西斯在第二次世界大战中失败时，他居然认为自己失去了“靠山”，因而表示惋惜。当他最近谈到这种完全丧失中国人民立场的思想的残余影响时，他感到十分痛心。许多技术人员根据总路线的精神深入地讨论了大中小型相结合的工业建设方针以后，开始批判了“洋”法先进，“土”法落后的错误观点。无机盐工业对发展尖端科学技术有着重要作用，目前我国在这方面还很落后，这个部的不少技术人员原来对于在无机盐工业方面迅速赶上资本主义国家缺乏信心，最近他们经过调查了解，发现北京用土法生产的金属钠和金属钙已经达到国际水平，全国已能生产无机盐的一定品种，这种情况使他们增强了信心。最近他们正在搜索土法加强研究，保证在今年6月中到7月底提供出生产八十五种无机盐品种的工厂设计。
    一个月来，迷信外国的那种奴隶思想已被搞臭，大家起来割掉奴隶尾巴，整个部里开始出现了一个人人尊重群众经验，重视“土法”，敢于大胆设想的新风气。这个月初，四个司和三个设计院的四十多位工程技术人员，就以革命的突击精神，只用了两天的时间，总结出各地运用土法生产化学肥料、酸碱、无机盐、有机化学产品、橡胶和医药产品的群众经验六十一种，出版了一本供各地根据具体情况加以推广的“全民办化学工业参考资料”。从5月下旬以来，各单位提出的重要技术革新倡议已有一百多项，其中有不少是过去根本不敢设想，甚至是世界其他国家都没有解决的问题。橡胶司的工程师们正研究采用高频率电流硫化橡胶，使原来需要一百四十到一百六十分钟的硫化时间缩短为七到十五分钟。医药司有人提出要用固体发酵的方法制造畜用抗生素，以便农业社采用。化工研究院的十多位青年技术人员，正在研究如何在县乡建立用土法生产过氯乙烯等合成纤维的小工厂。对于为迅速发展地方化学工业提供条件的各种小型化工厂的定型设计，人们现在已普遍树立“要想快就要少用钢材，要想多就必须农民能干村村能办”的新的指导思想，并且根据这种思想，努力进行着各种更加切合实际需要的设计。基本化学设计院用三天时间设计出土法制硫酸的小型工厂，年产硫酸八十吨，可用来制成磷肥二百吨，这个设计采用了瓦缸瓦罐与全国农具展览会上展出的木制脚踏式鼓风机，完全代替了钢铁做的设备，全部投资只需一千六百元，只要投入生产，四十天左右就可以把投资收回。氮肥设计院的设计人员，也正在设计一座可以由农业合作社举办的小小型氮肥厂，这个设计将尽可能做到就地取材，降低投资，保证在工厂投入生产几个月以后，就可以收回全部投资。负责制碱工业设计的技术人员，三天内突击出包括六种产品的四种“土”法设计，这些设计不用电力，投资只及“洋”法的三分之一到百分之一。（附图片）
