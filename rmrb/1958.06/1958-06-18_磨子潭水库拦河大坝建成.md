    Mozitan Reservoir Dam Completed
    Our country's first hollow gravity dam—the Mozitan Reservoir dam—was completed on June 9. This dam is located in the eastern source of the Pi River, upstream of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir in Huoshan County, Anhui Province, in the Dabie Mountains. The dam crest elevation is 204 meters, the length is 330 meters, with a total of 300,000 cubic meters of concrete poured, and it can hold 287 million cubic meters of floodwater. At the same time, the reservoir can also be used to generate 16,000 kilowatts of electricity to supply the development of industry and agriculture in the Dabie Mountains.

    磨子潭水库拦河大坝建成
    我国第一座空心重力坝——磨子潭水库拦河大坝于6月9日建成。这座拦河大坝，位于大别山区安徽省霍山县佛子岭水库上游的淠河东源。坝顶高程为二百零四公尺，长三百三十公尺，总计浇混凝土三十万公方，可拦蓄洪水二点八七亿公方。同时还可利用这个水库的水发电一万六千瓩，供应大别山区发展工、农业需要。　曹克林摄（新华社稿）（附图片）
