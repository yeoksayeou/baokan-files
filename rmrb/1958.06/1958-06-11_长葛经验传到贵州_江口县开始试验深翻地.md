Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 10th: Jiangkou County, known in Guizhou Province for promoting new agricultural tools and advanced farming techniques, is applying the deep plowing experience of Changge County, Henan Province, to its own land. Some representatives attending the county's four-level cadre ideological emancipation conference conducted an experiment on June 3rd on a plot of uncultivated land in the suburban commune, using four sets of plows.

The representatives plowed, measured with rulers, and studied. Using a double-wheeled double-moldboard plow, one plowing reached a depth of seven inches; plowing twice reached over nine inches; only plowing the third time reached a depth of more than one foot and three inches. Using a wheel-less single-moldboard plow three times could reach a depth of one foot and five inches, but people had to follow behind with hoes to push the soil, which was too labor-intensive. More than a hundred people followed the four sets of plows, repeatedly studying them for more than two hours. A technician suggested adding a soil-pushing device to the back of the double-wheeled double-moldboard plow to solve the problem of topsoil being covered. Someone said: As long as a way can be found to plow twice to a depth of one foot and five inches, the topsoil can be turned upwards. Someone said: Just dig it by hand; a dozen workers can dig one mu. Yao Hongxian, the first secretary of the county party committee who attended the Eighth National Congress of the Party, second session, and more than twenty people formed a circle, studying deep plowing methods and saying, "Deep plowing the land to a depth of one foot and five inches is definitely not an easy task. Whether we can do it depends on our determination. Changge County has 1.12 million mu of land and more than 500,000 people. Our county has 100,000 people and 200,000 mu of land. Compared, the average arable land area per person is even less than theirs. If they can do it, why can't we!"

From the evening of June 4th to 5th, after dinner, the representatives continued to test-plow twice. They replaced the iron wheels of the double-wheeled double-moldboard plow with wooden wheels half the size of the iron wheels. The cattle pulled more lightly, and one plowing could reach a depth of nine inches, and two plowing could reach a depth of one foot and five inches. If a double-wheeled single-moldboard plow is used, it can plow one foot deep in one go. With repeated plowing methods, the topsoil can be turned upwards.

The conference initially determined that the 20,000 mu of dry land that has not yet been cultivated should be deep-plowed first, and the experience should be summarized and comprehensively promoted after the autumn harvest. How to make the paddy fields both deep-plowed and leak-proof will require additional careful test-plowing and research. A few people believe that deep plowing should be up to seven inches at most. They say: "Deep plowing an inch of soil is worth a layer of fertilizer. Every farmer knows the benefits of deep plowing, but they are afraid that deep plowing one foot and five inches cannot be done." Therefore, the conference decided to conduct a debate on this issue and further study deep plowing methods that are more, faster, better, and more economical, in conjunction with agricultural technology reforms.

### 长葛经验传到贵州  江口县开始试验深翻地

    长葛经验传到贵州
    江口县开始试验深翻地
    新华社贵阳10日电　以推广新式农具和先进耕作技术而闻名贵州省的江口县，正在把河南省长葛县深耕经验运用到自己的土地上。参加全县四级干部思想解放大会的部分代表，6月3日在城郊社一块未耕种的土地上，套四副犁作了试验。
    代表们边犁边用尺量边研究。用双轮双铧犁犁一次深七寸，犁二次深九寸多，犁第三次，才深一尺三寸多。用无轮一铧犁犁三次，深可达一尺五寸，但犁后边得跟着人用锄推土，太费工。一百多人跟着四副犁，反复地研究了两个多小时。一位技术人员建议在双轮双铧犁后边加个推土设备，解决熟土被盖的问题。有人说：只要能设法犁两次即深一尺五寸，就能把熟土翻到上边。有人说：干脆用人挖，十几个工也能挖一亩。列席党的八大二次会议的县委第一书记姚洪显和二十多个人围成一个圈，一边研究深耕的方法，一边说，“把土地深耕一尺五寸，肯定不是件容易事，办到办不到，就看我们的决心了。人家长葛县有一百一十二万亩土地，五十多万人口。我们县十万人，二十万亩土地，一比，我们每个人的平均耕地面积还比人家少。人家能办到，我们为什么办不到！”
    6月4日到5日晚饭后，代表们又连续试耕了两次，他们把双轮双铧犁的铁轮换成比铁轮小一半的木轮，牛拉起来比较轻，一次即能犁九寸深，两次犁一尺五寸深。如果用双轮一铧犁，一次就能犁一尺深。用反复犁法，都能把熟土翻在上边。
    这次大会初步确定，目前先深耕那还没有耕种的二万亩旱地，秋收后总结经验全面推广。如何使水稻田既深耕又不漏水，还要另外进行仔细的试耕和研究。有少数人认为，深耕最多到七寸，他们说：“深耕一寸土，顶上一层粪，深耕的好处每个农民都晓得，就是深耕一尺五寸怕办不到。”因此，大会决定就此问题进行一次辩论，并结合农业技术改革进一步研究多快好省的深耕办法。
