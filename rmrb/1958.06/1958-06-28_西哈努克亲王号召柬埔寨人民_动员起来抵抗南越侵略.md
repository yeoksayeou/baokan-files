Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 26th: Prince Sihanouk called on all Cambodian people and militia on the evening of the 25th to mobilize and resist South Vietnamese aggression. He said that Cambodia cannot allow others to put it to death, and all Cambodian people should rise up to resolutely crush all aggression.

Sihanouk said on the radio that he had ordered the army to make full preparations and take necessary measures in Stung Treng province. At the same time, he expressed his hope that all people and political figures would unite around the royal family to resist aggression. He said that in the face of the current situation, we are not desperate, and Cambodia can rely on its neutral policy to defend its territorial integrity. He said that victory belongs to the people who love peace and justice.

He also asked the United States to persuade South Vietnam to stop its aggression and immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Cambodia. He said this is the responsibility of the U.S. government.

The Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, began to show a tense atmosphere from the 25th. Military trucks carrying soldiers passed by on the streets from time to time, and some private trucks have been requisitioned by the government.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 27th: The Cambodian National Assembly and the Royal Council held a joint meeting this morning. The meeting adopted a declaration requesting the parliaments of all countries in the world to find ways for their governments to quickly send observers to the scene to investigate the South Vietnamese aggression. The declaration firmly stated that if the United States cannot stop the South Vietnamese aggression, Cambodia will take all measures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Prior to this, Cambodian King Suramarit issued a statement on the 25th condemning South Vietnamese troops for invading Cambodia and asking countries friendly to Cambodia to support Cambodia, especially requesting the United States, "the common friend of Cambodia and South Vietnam," to stop the South Vietnamese aggression. The statement also pointed out that since the beginning of last year, South Vietnam has violated Cambodian territory 29 times and moved boundary markers deep into Cambodian territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 26th: According to Cambodian National Radio broadcast on the 26th, the Cambodian King has appointed Pho Proeung to organize a new cabinet. Pho Proeung is scheduled to request authorization from the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 26th.

Pho Proeung (formerly translated as Phuong Proeung) was the Minister of National Education, Labor and Social Welfare of the recently resigned Sim Var cabinet.
