Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th. Many rural middle schools in the Soviet Union have organized student production teams to participate in labor in collective farms. Currently, there are thousands of such teams nationwide. This approach has played a significant role in closely integrating students' theoretical knowledge with production practice. Many middle school graduates who have participated in these teams have performed excellently in collective farms. The work content of student teams includes field work, as well as planting fruit trees, raising livestock, participating in the construction of rural clubs and sports grounds, and so on. Many teams have also established technical learning groups to learn how to drive cars, agricultural machines, and electric sheep shearing, etc.

This method of closely integrating teaching with labor production has achieved good results. As a result of labor education, the academic performance of many students has improved, the sense of collectivism has been strengthened, and instances of indiscipline have been greatly reduced. The students have great enthusiasm for labor. At present, new student teams are constantly being organized. In Ukraine, Krasnodar Krai, Stalingrad, and Rostov Oblast, some teams have already been organized. Urban middle schools are also beginning to organize teams to participate in urban greening and construction work.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th. Many higher agricultural schools in the Soviet Union have successively moved from cities to rural areas in order to more closely integrate teaching with production practice.

Currently, agricultural colleges in Latvia, Lithuania, and Gorky have moved to rural areas, and the Irkutsk Agricultural College and the Kharkov Animal Husbandry College will also be moving to rural areas soon. The state has built well-equipped teaching buildings, laboratories, and dormitories for schools moving to rural areas. After the schools move to rural areas, each agricultural college will have a teaching and experimental farm with a considerable area. Students can directly master agricultural machinery and work in livestock farms and field work teams during their studies. In this way, students can acquire production skills through practice and rapidly grow into comprehensive agricultural experts.

    使书本上的知识同生产实践相结合
    苏联农村中学生参加农庄劳动
    许多高等农业学校从城市迁到农村
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联许多农村的中学都组织学生生产工作队到集体农庄去参加劳动。现在，全国已经有数千个这样的工作队。这种办法已经在使学生的理论知识同生产实践密切结合方面起了很大作用。许多参加过这种工作队的中学毕业生在集体农庄里都工作得很出色。学生工作队的工作内容除了田间工作以外，还有种植果树、饲养家畜、参加建设农村俱乐部和运动场等等。许多工作队还成立了技术学习小组，学习驾驶汽车、农业机器、电气剪羊毛等。
    这种教学同劳动生产紧密结合的方法已经取得了很好的效果。劳动教育的结果使得许多学生的学习成绩提高了，集体观念加强了，不守纪律的现象大为减少。学生们的劳动干劲很大。目前，新的学生工作队还在不断地组织起来。在乌克兰、克拉斯诺达边疆区、斯大林格勒和罗斯托夫州，都已经组织了一些工作队。城市的中学校也在开始组织工作队，它们参加城市的绿化工作和建筑工作。
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联许多高等农业学校陆续从城市迁往农村，以便使教学和生产实际更密切地结合。
    现在，拉脱维亚、立陶宛和高尔基等农学院已经迁到农村，伊尔库茨克农学院和哈尔科夫动物饲养学院最近也将迁往农村。国家为迁往农村的学校修建了设备完善的教学大楼、实验室和宿舍等。学校迁入农村以后，每所农学院都拥有一块面积相当大的教学实验农场，学生在学习期间可以直接掌握农业机器，在畜牧场和田间工作队工作。这样学生就可以通过实践获得生产技能，迅速成长为全面的农业专家。
