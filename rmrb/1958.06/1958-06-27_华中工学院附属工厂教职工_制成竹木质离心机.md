Faculty and staff of the Attached Factory of Huazhong Institute of Technology
    Manufacture Bamboo and Wood Centrifuge

The faculty and staff of the Attached Factory of Huazhong Institute of Technology, after working hard for four days and three nights, successfully trial-produced China's first bamboo and wood centrifuge at 2:00 PM on June 15th, opening up a new path for the mechanization of the sugar industry.

In May of this year, the Attached Factory of the Institute of Technology accepted the task assigned by the Provincial Planning Commission to manufacture 500 centrifuges, with a very tight schedule, requiring all deliveries to be completed in August.

The trial production work started on the 12th, and it only took four days and three nights from start to successful trial production. On the 12th, Director Huang dictated, and a teacher drew the drawings. A simple drawing was made in one day, and the intensive trial production stage began that evening. During the trial production process, the branch secretary, factory director, teachers, technicians, and apprentices worked together, and the Party committee secretary also came to the site to study for six hours. During the first trial run, the lower mandrel was installed too tightly and became a little hot. Everyone promptly made corrections, and this bamboo and wood centrifuge was successfully trial-produced.

The production efficiency of the bamboo and wood centrifuge is about the same as that of the iron centrifuge, and its cost is very low. The main body of an iron centrifuge costs more than 1,300 yuan, while the bamboo and wood centrifuge only costs 160 yuan. The successful trial production of this bamboo and wood centrifuge broke the mystery of manufacturing centrifuges, making it possible for general small factories in rural areas to manufacture them.

On the day the bamboo and wood centrifuge was successfully trial-produced, Comrade Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the institute to congratulate them. He highly praised the new initiative of the faculty, staff, and students of the institute.

    华中工学院附属工厂教职工
    制成竹木质离心机
    华中工学院附属工厂的教职工，苦战了四天三夜，于6月15日下午二时，试制成功了我国第一台竹木质离心机，给制糖工业机械化开辟了新途径。
    今年5月，工学院附属工厂接受了省计委分配的五百台离心机的制造任务，时间非常紧迫，要求在8月份全部交货。
    试制工作从12日开始，一直到试制成功只花了四天三夜，12日当天，由黄厂长口述，教师绘图，一天就绘出了一个简易图纸，当天晚上就投入了紧张的试制阶段。在试制过程中，支部书记、厂长、教师、技工、学徒一起干，党委书记也到现场研究了六个小时。在第一次试运转时，下边的心轴装的太紧有点发热，大家及时的进行了修正，使这台竹木质的离心机试制成功了。
    竹木质离心机的生产效能和铁质离心机差不多，它的成本很低，一台铁质离心机本体要一千三百多元，竹木质离心机只要一百六十元一台。这种竹木质离心机试制成功后，打破了制造离心机的神秘，使农村里一般小型工厂也能制造了。
    在竹木质离心机试制成功的这天，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重同志到该院祝贺，他十分赞扬该院教职工和学员的新创举。
