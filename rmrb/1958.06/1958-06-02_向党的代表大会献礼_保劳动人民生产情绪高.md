Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 31st – Bulgarian newspapers reported that the working people of Bulgaria have launched a massive labor upsurge to welcome the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which will open on June 2nd.

The construction workers and installation workers of the sintering plant of the Lenin Steel Plant near Dimitrovgrad worked heroically in the wind and rain for many days, overcame various difficulties, and finally completed the sintering plant on May 29 and started trial production. The completion of the sintering plant will improve the labor productivity of Bulgarian iron smelting and the quality of pig iron.

During the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a new reservoir will appear on the map of Bulgaria - the "Toshkov Chark Reservoir," where the last few cubic meters of concrete are now being poured. This is a gift from all the builders of the reservoir to the Congress. A factory in Razgrad that produces canned fruits and vegetables will also be put into production during the Congress.

On the eve of the Party Congress, forty-seven locomotive teams of the Ruse Railway Locomotive Depot transported more than 900 tons of cargo in excess of the quota.

To welcome the Party Congress, the Bulgarian National Conservatory of Music sent many cultural groups to factories to hold musical performances for the workers. Painters have created many works reflecting the heroic labor of the Bulgarian people and are now striving to create works of higher artistic level to more fully reflect the new face of socialist construction.

    向党的代表大会献礼
    保劳动人民生产情绪高
    新华社索非亚31日电　据保加利亚报纸报道，保加利亚全国劳动人民为迎接将在6月2日开幕的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，掀起了巨大的劳动热潮。
    季米特洛夫市附近的列宁钢铁厂的烧结厂的建筑工人和安装工人在风雨中英勇地工作了很多天，克服了种种困难，终于在5月29日使烧结厂完工并开始试验生产。烧结厂的建成将提高保加利亚炼铁的劳动生产率和生铁的质量。
    在保共第七次代表大会开会期间，保加利亚的地图上将出现一个新的水库——“托什可夫·查尔克水库”，这里现在正在浇灌最后几立方公尺的混凝土。这是水库的全体建设者对代表大会的献礼。拉士格拉德市的一个生产水果和蔬菜罐头的工厂也将在代表大会期间投入生产。
    在代表大会前夕，鲁西城铁路机务段的四十七个机车组超过定额多运输了九百多吨货物。
    为迎接党的代表大会，保加利亚国立音乐学院派出了许多文化小组到各工厂为工人们举行音乐演奏会。画家们已经创作出许多反映保加利亚人民英勇劳动的作品，现在正努力创作艺术水平更高的作品，以更充分地反映社会主义建设的新面貌。
