Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 27th: John Teasdale, Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, accused the United States on the 26th of engaging in unscrupulous wheat dumping practices that are damaging Australia's traditional wheat markets.

Teasdale specifically condemned the U.S. practice of selling wheat through long-term loans. He also accused the U.S. of selling wheat exports during 1956-1957 at prices lower than those in the U.S. domestic market. He said that this has almost completely destroyed Australia's wheat market in India and Pakistan, and has also seriously damaged its market in Europe.

    美国倾销小麦
    澳大利亚吃不消
    新华社27日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚小麦委员会主席约翰·特萨戴耳26日指责美国不择手段倾销小麦的行为，破坏了澳大利亚的传统小麦市场。
    特萨戴耳特别谴责美国以长期贷款方式来出售小麦的手段。他还指责美国在1956—1957年期间输出的小麦都以比美国国内价格还低的价格抛售。他说，这样就差不多完全破坏了澳大利亚在印度和巴基斯坦的小麦市场，并且也严重地破坏了它在欧洲的市场。
