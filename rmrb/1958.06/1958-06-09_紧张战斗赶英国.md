　　Fighting Tensely to Catch Up with England

　　At noon on May 31st, the factory was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, just as I had expected: our first blooming mill was successfully assembled! I didn't even bother to have lunch, and with excitement, I ran to the extraordinarily lively assembly workshop. I saw the new blooming mill, in which I also had a hand, standing like a giant among the crowd. The words "Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory" on the frame shone brightly under the strong light of the photographic lamps. I felt extremely happy. At this moment, comrades from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio wanted to shoot a news documentary. I quickly changed into my work clothes. Although they were very dirty, I had to wear them, because I had been wearing them throughout the process of assembling the blooming mill.

　　The blooming mill is the throat of the steel rolling plant, and it plays a decisive role in increasing steel production. In the past, our factory had not assembled a blooming mill before, and the comrades lacked confidence in being able to produce such a machine in a short period of time. Since the Party put forward the great call to catch up with England in fifteen years, we were inspired by the magnificent spirit of this call and were eager to contribute all our strength to our beloved Party and our beloved motherland. Thus, in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in production, we accepted the task of assembling this blooming mill.

　　On May 28th, when we erected the frame of the blooming mill, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party victoriously closed. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism was officially announced, and the timeframe for catching up with and surpassing England was changed from fifteen years or a "little more" to within fifteen years or even a "shorter" time. This call from the Party and Chairman Mao further boosted our enthusiasm, and we were determined to complete the assembly of this blooming mill in May. Then, the tense battle began. Our assembly workers stood on the front line of the battle. The workshop director, the Party branch secretary, and engineers all came to the front to command the operations. After more than two days of hard work, this arduous and glorious task was finally completed victoriously. In a few days, this blooming mill that we assembled will be sent to Beijing for exhibition, so that our beloved Chairman Mao and the dear people of the capital can inspect our achievements.

　　紧张战斗赶英国
    5月31日中午，厂内锣鼓喧天，正如我所想的：是我们的第一台初轧机装配成功了。我顾不得吃午饭，怀着激动的心情跑到异常热闹的装配工段，见到那台也有我的劳动在里边的新初轧机，像巨人一样的站在人群当中，机架上“沈阳重机厂”的字样在光度很强的摄影灯下闪烁着光辉，心中万分高兴。这时，新影制片厂的同志要拍新闻纪录片了，我急忙换上工作服，虽然它很脏，但一定要穿，因为在装配初轧机的过程中，我一直穿着它。
    初轧机是轧钢厂的咽喉，它对提高钢材产量起着决定性的作用。过去我们厂没有装配过初轧机，同志们也缺乏信心在短期内能生产这种机器。自从党提出十五年赶上英国的伟大号召后，我们为这个号召的雄伟气魄所鼓舞，急于要把自己的全部力量贡献给亲爱的党和亲爱的祖国。于是，在生产大跃进的高潮中，我们接受了装配这台初轧机的任务。
    5月28日，当我们把初轧机机架竖立起来时，党的“八大”二次会议胜利闭幕后，正式公布了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，并把要在十五年或更“多”一点的时间改成了要在十五年内或更“短”的时间赶上和超过英国。党和毛主席的这个号召，更鼓舞了我们的干劲，坚决要在5月份完成这台初轧机的装配任务。接着紧张的战斗开始了。我们装配工站在战斗的最前线，车间主任、党总支书记、工程师等都亲临阵地指挥作战，经过两天多的苦战，这个艰巨而光荣的任务终于胜利的完成了。几天以后，我们装配成的这台初轧机就要送到北京展览，请我们敬爱的毛主席、亲爱的首都人民检阅我们的成绩。　　　　沈阳重型机器厂钳工　潘平
