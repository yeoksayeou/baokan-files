　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Washington News: U.S. President Eisenhower openly stated at a press conference on the 18th that the United States would strengthen its subversive and disruptive activities against socialist countries. He stated that the United States is willing to do anything that helps weaken the unity of the socialist camp. He said that “anything that would help force” socialist countries “to break away” from the socialist camp is “good,” and he is willing to provide “assistance.”
　　Eisenhower said this when reporters asked whether the United States should provide economic assistance to socialist countries. He also said that "what the United States needs to do now" is to "establish centrifugal forces, not centripetal forces" within the socialist camp. He went on to say, "The United States has already done a lot of work in this regard."
　　In this way, Eisenhower, in the capacity of a head of state, elevated the shameless act of carrying out subversive and disruptive activities against socialist countries to the level of national policy.
　　Precisely because of this, Eisenhower expressed great annoyance at the Hungarian government's execution of counter-revolutionary leaders Nagy and others at a press conference. He viciously slandered the Soviet Union and the Hungarian People's Republic, and forcibly linked such a purely Hungarian internal affair with the issue of holding a summit meeting, saying that the execution of Nagy and others had "frustrated" his hopes for holding a summit meeting. Eisenhower, like Dulles, also stated that the United States was prepared to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon.

### 艾森豪威尔公然发出无耻的叫嚣  妄图加强对社会主义阵营的颠复活动

    艾森豪威尔公然发出无耻的叫嚣
    妄图加强对社会主义阵营的颠复活动
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔18日在记者招待会上公开表示，美国要对社会主义阵营国家加强它的颠复破坏活动。他表示，美国愿意做任何有助于削弱社会主义阵营的团结的事情。他说，“任何会有助于迫使”社会主义国家“脱离”社会主义阵营的东西是“好的”，他愿意加以“援助”。
    艾森豪威尔在记者询问美国是否应当向社会主义国家提供经济援助的时候说了这番话。他还说，“美国现在要做的”是在社会主义阵营“内部建立离心力量，而不是向心力量”。他接着说，“在这方面，美国已经做了许多工作”。
    这样，艾森豪威尔就以一个国家首脑的身分，把对社会主义国家进行颠复破坏活动的无耻勾当，提到了国家政策的水平。
    正因为这样，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上对于匈牙利政府处决反革命首脑纳吉等人表示十分恼怒。他对苏联和匈牙利人民共和国进行了恶毒的诬蔑，并且把这样一个纯属匈牙利内部事务的事情同举行最高级会议问题硬拉扯在一起，说什么纳吉等人的处决使他对举行最高级会议所抱的希望“受到挫折”。艾森豪威尔同杜勒斯一样，还表示美国准备对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。
