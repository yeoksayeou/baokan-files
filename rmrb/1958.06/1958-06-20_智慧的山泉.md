    The Wisdom of the Mountain Spring
    Yan Ling
    Is this really the County Committee, or a woodworking factory? The sign at the gate clearly reads "The Chinese Communist Party, Yanchang County Committee"; however, the yard is full of shavings and sawdust, and everywhere are busy hammers and drills, everywhere are craftsmen and technicians discussing as they work...

    A foot-operated stone mill, converted from a Liberation-style waterwheel's reversing gear and a cotton gin's large wheel and crankshaft. The two millstones are so big, but they whirl around with a booming sound when you step on the pedals.

    A handcart, seemingly an ordinary handcart; however, it can automatically dump soil. After pulling the soil to the destination, pull the handbrake, and the soil will automatically slide down.

    In the north courtyard, a piston-style water pump is being tested on a well. Press the lever a few times, and water is lifted from the well, five or six zhang deep, and flows out with a splash.

    In the south courtyard, two kinds of tamping machines are being installed. One is a small, portable rammer made of wood, for small-scale construction sites; the other is a semi-mechanized "automatic rammer" for larger construction sites. The small one can save half the manpower compared to the original rammer; the large one can save two-thirds of the manpower.

    Although it is drizzling, people's enthusiasm is very high, and they keep busy and running around in the rain. Many people are gathered around these machines. Some are trying this, some are trying that, all with smiles on their faces. Some are carefully observing how the various parts of each machine are rotating, some are enthusiastically suggesting how to improve them to the creators, and some are silently contemplating - are they perhaps conceiving the prototype of new machines in their minds?

    Who are these craftsmen and technicians? There are county party secretaries, heads of county propaganda departments, directors and members of the woodworking production cooperatives and ironware production cooperatives, ordinary carpenters from the countryside, and general cadres of the county party committee... Today, they are drawn to one place by a common interest.

    I walked into a stone cave dwelling, where the printing press of the "Yanchang Daily" is located. Next to the printing press, the printing worker Liu Jianshi is busy drawing. He worked at the "Liberation Daily" printing factory in Yan'an from 1941, after coming from Northwest Shanxi, until the "Liberation Daily" ceased publication in 1947. After Yan'an was recovered, he continued to work at the Yan'an printing factory. With the great development of the people's newspaper work, each county was running its own newspaper, and he followed his beloved printing press from Yan'an to Yanchang. Here, he not only prints the newspaper, but also works as a distributor. Now, what is he quietly thinking about drawing? He said: I'm trying to see if I can design a straw cutter. - In his mind, the printing press and the straw cutter are connected.

    In the county party secretary's cave dwelling, Zhang Hanwu, from the Yan'an regional sub-group of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee inspection team, is temporarily staying while inspecting work in Yanchang. This United Front Minister of the Provincial Party Committee has recently been very enthusiastic about the new "united front" - the "united front" of large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, the "united front" of new, improved, and old agricultural tools, the "united front" of expert, craftsman, and farmer technological reforms. In his inspection work, he energetically runs around on water conservancy construction sites, in the countryside, in towns, in valleys, on plains, and on plateaus, enthusiastically introducing the various new technologies, new tools, and new knowledge he knows to rural cadres and the masses; at the same time, he is absorbing fresh things from the masses. This day, he is also drawing drawings in the stone cave dwelling, making models, and thinking of new ideas...

    The most attractive thing is still the "automatic rammer." It was born on the Xinzhuangkou water conservancy construction site in Guoqi District.

    The dam project must be completed before the flood season arrives. At the same time, soil and water conservation, afforestation, and spring plowing, none of them can be relaxed. The labor force in the mountainous area is already insufficient, and this spring it seems particularly tight. What to do? County Party Secretary Zhang Tan, who often lives on the water conservancy construction site, and other cadres came up with many good ideas together with the masses. They adjusted the labor organization, carried out political work on the construction site, and then focused their attention on improving tools.

    First, earth drag boards were used instead of iron shovels to shovel earth. Then, the "automatic earth transport vehicle," modeled after the winches in coal mines, appeared. Then, the wooden frame portable rammer appeared.

    They still felt that this portable rammer was not strong enough. Comrade Zhang Tan came up with an idea: to build a larger, high-frame rammer with greater force. He called together Ge Chengsheng, the secretary of the construction site branch, and Liu Yanchang, the engineering captain, and each of them made a model using gaoliang stalks; after they were finished, they compared them together, drawing on each other's strengths and merging them into one. When making the wooden frame, Zhang Shanxian, a carpenter in his twenties, came up with another good idea: install two gears to make it walk by itself. This was even better! However, there were still shortcomings: the overall weight was very heavy, and it was very inconvenient when turning. What to do? Yan Zhongren, a township party secretary working on the construction site, came up with another good idea: install a support column under the wooden frame, plus a lever; when turning, press the lever, and this behemoth can easily turn around.

    That shy young carpenter, Zhang Shanxian, is now next to the foot-operated mill designed by Zhao Zhenxing, the head of the County Propaganda Department, silently watching the mill turn. He saw that some parts were not working well, and he silently intervened and helped to modify it.

    Looking at the clusters of people in the yard, the new machines, and then looking at the ridges and valleys in the misty drizzle. A lively picture appeared before my eyes: the riverbank, the construction site, the fields, the streets, the factory, the office, the classroom... everywhere is a laboratory for new technologies, and everyone is a creator of new technologies. After the rain, the water in the Yan River became noisy again. I seemed to see the spring of the people's wisdom, gushing out from countless deep mountain gorges, converging into a huge river, and roaring towards the vast ocean...

    智慧的山泉
    燕凌
    这究竟是县委会，还是木工厂？大门口的牌子上明明写着“中国共产党延长县委员会”；可是，院子里，到处是刨花、锯末，到处是忙忙碌碌的锤子、钻子，到处是一边动手一边议论的工匠、技师……
    一座利用解放式水车的变向齿轮和轧花车的大轮、曲轴改装成的脚踏石磨。那么大的两扇磨石，脚踏着踏板就轰轰隆隆转动起来了。
    一个架子车，看来是普普通通的架子车；可是，它能自动倒土。把土拉到了目的地，把手闸一扳，土就自动溜下去了。
    北边院子里的井上，正在试验一个唧筒式的抽水器械。手扳着杠杆压几下，水就从五六丈深的井下提了上来，哗哗地流。
    南边院子里，正在安装两种打夯器械。一个是小规模工地用的木架轻便硪；一个是较大的工地用的半机械化的“自动硪”。小的比原先用的硪可节省一半人力；大的可节省人力三分之二。
    虽然细雨蒙蒙，人们的兴致却很浓，在雨里忙个不停，跑个不停。在这些器械旁围了许多人。这个试试，那个试试，个个面带笑容。一些人细心地观察着各种器械各个部分是怎样在转动，一些人热心地向创造者提出该怎样改进，一些人在默默地沉思——在他们的脑子里，是不是正孕育着新的器械的雏型？
    这些工匠和技师是谁？有县委书记，有县委宣传部长，有木业生产合作社、铁业生产合作社的主任和社员，有农村里普通木匠，有县委机关的一般干部……今天，他们被一种共同兴趣吸引到一个地方来了。
    我走进一个石窑洞，那里放着“延长报”的印刷机。在印刷机旁边，印刷工人刘建世正在忙着绘图。他是1941年由晋西北到延安“解放日报”印刷厂工作的，直到1947年“解放日报”停刊。延安光复以后他仍然在延安印刷厂工作。随着人民的报纸工作的大发展，各个县都在办自己的报纸，他就跟随着自己心爱的印刷机从延安到了延长。在这里，他不光印报，还兼做发行工作。现在，他在静静地思索着画些什么呢？他说：我在试试看，想设计一个铡草机。——在他的脑子里，印刷机和铡草机联系了起来。
    在县委书记的窑洞里，临时住着正在延长检查工作的陕西省委检查团延安地区分团的张汉武同志。这位省委统战部长最近很热中于新的“统一战线”——大型的、中型的、小型的水利工程的“统一战线”，新式的、改良的、旧式的农业工具的“统一战线”，专家的、工匠的、农民的改革技术的“统一战线”。他在检查工作中，精力充沛地在水利工地上、农村里、市镇上、山谷里、川地上、塬地上到处奔走，热情地把他知道的各种新技术、新工具、新知识介绍给农村干部和群众；同时，又在群众中吸取着新鲜的事物。这一天，他也在石窑洞里画着图样，做着模型，想着新主意……
    最有吸引力的还是那个“自动硪”。它是在郭旗区新庄科水利工地上诞生的。
    大坝工程要赶在洪水期到来以前完工。同时，水土保持、造林、春耕，哪一样也不能放松。山区劳动力本来就不充足，今年春天就分外显得周转不灵。怎么办？经常住在水利工地的县委书记张檀同志和别的干部同群众在一起想出了许多好办法。他们把劳动组织作了调整，开展了工地政治工作，接着就把注意力集中到改进工具上了。
    先是用土拉板代替铁锨铲土。接着，仿效煤矿上的绞车做的“自动运土车”出现了。接着，木架轻便硪出现了。
    他们还嫌这轻便硪不够劲。张檀同志出了个主意：造一个力量更大的高架大硪。他把工地支部书记葛成生、工程队长刘彦昌找来，几个人各自用?黍（高粱）秆做了一个模型；做好了以后，放在一起比较，取长补短，合而为一。在做木架子的时候，二十多岁的木匠张善贤又出了个好主意：装上两个齿轮，叫它自己会走路。这就更妙了！可是，还有美中不足的地方：整个重量很沉，需要转弯扭头的时候很不灵便。怎么办？在工地工作的一个乡支部书记阎忠仁又想了一个好办法：在木架下边装上一根支柱，再加上一根杠杆；需要转弯的时候把杠杆一压，这个庞然大物很轻便地就能扭过身子来了。
    那个靦靦覥覥的年轻木匠张善贤，现在他正在县委宣传部长赵振兴设计的脚踏磨子旁边，不声不响地看着磨子转动。他看出有些地方不大得劲，就不声不响地插上了手，帮助修改起来。
    望着院子里一簇簇人群，一个个新器械，又望望蒙蒙细雨中的冈峦和山谷。我眼前出现了一幅热闹的图画：河边，工地，田野，街头，工场，办公室，课堂……处处都是新技术的实验室，人人都是新技术的创造者。下了雨，延河里的水又喧闹起来了。我仿佛看见群众的智慧的泉水，从无数深山狭谷中奔流而出，汇合成巨大的河流，又在呼啸着向汪洋大海奔腾而去……
