    Capital Automobile Company: Do you still want the transportation fee?
    On April 27th, our association organized members to visit the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing and rented three large buses from the Beijing Capital Automobile Company. After use, we asked the drivers to tell their company's business department to settle the transportation fee account as soon as possible so that we could make the payment. However, it has been more than a month, and we have inquired several times, but the company still has not settled the account or responded. Because this transportation fee is borne by each participating unit, we cannot settle the account with the units if it is delayed. As a result, the units have opinions and criticize our work as being slow and dragging.
    We ask the Capital Automobile Company: Do you actually want this transportation fee or not?

    首都汽车公司：你们还要不要车费？
    4月27日，我会组织会员前往北京参观十三陵水库，租用北京首都汽车公司大型客车三辆，用后，就请司机同志回去告诉他们公司业务部门尽速结算车资账目，我们好付款。但是到现在已一个多月，我们几次催问，这个公司仍没结算也不答复。因为这项车费由各参观单位负担，迟迟不结算我们就无法和各参观单位算清这笔账，结果各单位有意见，批评我们工作拖拉。
    我们问首都汽车公司：你们到底还要不要这笔车费？
