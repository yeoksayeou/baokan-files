Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 2nd: TASS reports from Moscow on June 2nd: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, said in a letter on May 30th to Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker that the Canadian government's attitude towards the general cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, despite many reservations with which the Soviet Union cannot agree, is in many respects consistent with the aims pursued by the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of further testing of such weapons.

Khrushchev, in reply to Mr. Diefenbaker's letter of May 9th, pointed out that some of the reservations and concerns contained in Diefenbaker's letter are due to distrust of the Soviet Union, which was fostered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Canadian Prime Minister artificially insisted that the Soviet government's opposition to US aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs flying towards the Soviet border undermined the significance of the Soviet decision to stop nuclear weapons testing. Khrushchev said in the letter that these are two fundamentally different things in essence. At the same time, Canada's assessment of the US government's actions is extremely one-sided.

The letter emphasized that there is no reason for US bombers to fly towards the Soviet border, because the Soviet side has not taken any action that could be considered a threat to the security of the United States or any other country.

The letter went on to say that since US aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs are flying over Canadian territory, and bases and technical service equipment for these aircraft are set up there, the Canadian leaders should not be indifferent to these flights, which also pose a serious danger to Canada itself.

Khrushchev said that we very much regret that the Canadian government is willing to share responsibility for these flights with the US government to a large extent, as confirmed by the recent agreement signed between the United States and Canada on the unification of the air force command of the two countries.

Given Mr. Diefenbaker's support for the idea of ​​air surveillance to prevent surprise attacks, Khrushchev said that the Soviet government's proposal last year to establish air surveillance zones in Central Europe, the Far East, and corresponding regions of the United States (which takes into account the interests of the security of all parties concerned) is still valid. The letter said that since this proposal has not been positively treated by the US side, "we cannot regard the proposal to establish air surveillance in the Arctic region as anything other than a deliberate attempt to divert public attention from the threat to peace caused by the provocative actions of the US Air Force."

Khrushchev emphasized that no steps by the United States and other participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have so profoundly exposed these countries' poor stance on the fundamental issues of easing international tensions and ending the "Cold War" as the proposal on establishing surveillance in the Arctic region.

### 赫鲁晓夫写信给加拿大总理说  美国空军挑衅行动威胁了和平

　　赫鲁晓夫写信给加拿大总理说
    美国空军挑衅行动威胁了和平
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在5月30日给加拿大总理约翰·迪芬贝克的信中说，加拿大政府对普遍停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的态度，尽管有许多苏联所不能同意的保留条件，但是在许多方面同苏联单方面停止继续试验这种武器所追求的目的是一致的。
    赫鲁晓夫在答复迪芬贝克先生5月9日的信时指出，迪芬贝克信中所包含的一些保留条件和疑虑是由于对苏联的不信任而产生的，这种不信任是北大西洋公约组织培植起来的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，加拿大总理人为地硬说苏联政府反对载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行的做法削弱了苏联关于停止试验核武器这个决定的意义。赫鲁晓夫在信中说，这是本质上根本不同的两件事。同时，加拿大对美国政府的这种行动的评价是极为片面的。
    信中强调指出，美国轰炸机朝苏联边境飞行是没有任何理由的，因为苏联方面根本没有采取任何行动可以被人认为是威胁美国的安全和其他任何国家的安全。
    信件接着说，载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机在加拿大领土上空飞行，并且在那里设置了这些飞机的基地和技术服务设备，因而加拿大的领导人就不应该漠不关心地对待这种对加拿大本国也具有严重危险的飞行。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们非常遗憾的是，加拿大政府不惜在很大程度上同美国政府分担这种飞行的责任，最近美国和加拿大签定的关于两国空军司令部统一的协议就证实了这一点。
    鉴于迪芬贝克先生支持那种为防止突然袭击而进行空中监察的主张，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府去年提出的关于在中欧、远东和美国的相应地区建立空中监察的建议（这个建议考虑到一切有关方面的安全的利益）仍然有效。信件说，但是由于这项建议没有得到美国方面的积极对待，“我们就不能把关于在北极地区建立空中监察的建议看作是别的，只能看作是故意企图使公众不去注意那种由于美国空军挑衅行动所引起的对和平的威胁”。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，美国和北大西洋公约组织其他参加国方面的任何步骤都没有像关于在北极地区建立监察的建议这样极深刻地揭露了这些国家在缓和国际紧张局势和停止“冷战”的根本问题上的恶劣立场。
