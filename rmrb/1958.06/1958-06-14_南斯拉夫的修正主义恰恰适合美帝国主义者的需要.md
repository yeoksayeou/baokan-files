The attack launched by the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) against the Soviet Union and the international communist movement through the LCY's revisionist program and the Seventh Congress of the LCY has been met with a stern response from communist and workers' parties of various countries. Now, a major struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism is unfolding. This struggle is of paramount importance to the international communist movement and the just cause of defending world peace.

The leading group of the LCY has so far been unable to offer any tenable answers to the criticisms raised by the communist parties of various countries, nor is it possible for them to offer such answers. Their so-called answers are merely sophistry, such as portraying their ugly behavior of serving U.S. imperialists as "seeking common factors in the direction of peace and international cooperation," and even claiming that this behavior is consistent with the goals of Soviet foreign policy. They even forcibly link Yugoslavia's economic dependence on the United States with the Soviet Union's proposal to expand U.S.-Soviet trade, two completely different things in nature. On the other hand, they describe the stern criticisms made by Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries as "interference in internal affairs," "unprincipled struggle," and "detrimental to world peace." But facts cannot be concealed by lies. Any objective observer can see that it is precisely the leading group of the LCY, with its policy of serving the U.S. imperialists, the planners of a new war, while wearing a socialist mask, that plays a particularly harmful role in the just cause of defending world peace. It is precisely for this reason that the U.S. imperialists, who hate the socialist camp and peace, greatly admire Yugoslavia.

The emergence of Yugoslav revisionism is not accidental. After the end of World War II, socialism has become a new world system. In order to save the increasingly profound general crisis of capitalism, U.S. imperialists, in addition to continuing to use the old revisionism, namely social democracy, as a tool, always wanted to find new tools from within socialist countries. They believed that it would be most ideal if there could be a "socialist" country, bearing the banner of Marxism-Leninism, to split the socialist camp from within. Dulles was quite confident that the policies of the Yugoslav leadership could suit the needs of the United States. When he talked about Yugoslavia at a press conference on August 6 last year, he said: "It is possible to have a Communist regime that is not controlled by what we call 'international communism' or Soviet-style communism." Dulles's statement included the following: First, the new tool needed by U.S. imperialism should not be called "international communism" by them, that is, it should be labeled as so-called "communism," but it should be opposed to international communism. Second, this new tool cannot be "Soviet-style communism," that is, it must abandon the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, abandon the path of the October Revolution, and be opposed to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Third, this new tool is a "regime" controlled by "communism" that has the above two characteristics. This is especially important, because in today's world where socialism has become a world system, only revisionists who have seized power in the original socialist countries can serve imperialism more effectively. In Dulles's view, it must have such "specifications" to be an ideal tool, and Yugoslav revisionism precisely meets Dulles's ideal.

American capitalists are willing to invest huge sums of money in cultivating such a tool as Yugoslav revisionism. According to U.S. Senator Nolan, the United States has given the Tito government nearly 1.5 billion dollars in aid (Associated Press, Washington, March 20 this year). Everyone knows that in the LCY's draft program of more than 150,000 words, the term "U.S. imperialism" is never used even once, just like avoiding the "sacred name" of the emperor. This situation is also reflected in the speeches of the LCY leaders. For example, in his report to the Seventh Congress of the LCY, Tito described the U.S. aggression against Syria last year as follows: "The consequences of the pressure exerted on Syria last year accelerated the union of Egypt and Syria..." Regarding the U.S. aggression against Indonesia, he said: "Indonesia replayed a similar history. Due to the conspiracies of certain Western groups and interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, a civil war broke out in the young, unified Republic of Indonesia." In short, it seems that U.S. imperialism does not exist in the world at all! May I ask: How can a party that claims to be Marxist-Leninist dare not point out the existence of U.S. imperialism when analyzing the current world situation? If this is not the result of the influence of the U.S. dollar, what other explanation can there be? It should be known that in many capitalist countries that advocate peace and neutrality, such as India, Indonesia, and the United Arab Republic, many of their politicians and political commentators do not call themselves Marxist-Leninists, but they dare to condemn the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism!

The leading group of the LCY is trying its best to deny that their program precisely meets the needs of the imperialists—especially the U.S. imperialists. However, facts speak louder than words. We might as well briefly review a few major historical facts in recent years to see clearly the ugly face of Yugoslav revisionism and how they adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialists.

First, during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, the leading group of the LCY played the role of a provocateur and interventionist. They openly called the counter-revolutionary rebellion a revolution and supported it. They encouraged and supported the "workers' councils" controlled by counter-revolutionaries to carry out activities against the revolutionary government of workers and peasants, maintained close ties with the traitor Nagy group, and openly protected the counter-revolutionaries such as Nagy. The Yugoslav embassy in Hungary became a haven for these counter-revolutionaries. It was only because the leading comrades of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party consistently adhered to a correct and principled stand in suppressing the rebellion and after quelling the rebellion that their conspiracy did not succeed, and they had no choice but to support the Hungarian government headed by Kadar on the surface. However, to this day, the position taken by the leading group of the LCY on this issue is still echoing that of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly tried to list the so-called "Hungarian question" as an agenda item for discussion by the United Nations, vainly attempting to "break through" Hungary, this "gap," through the United Nations controlled by the U.S. imperialists. And Tito also stated in his report to the Seventh Congress of the LCY that "Yugoslavia advocates resolving this issue in the United Nations." Is this not enough to show that the propositions of the leading group of the LCY precisely meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists?

Second, in November 1956, Tito delivered a speech in Pula, participating in the anti-Soviet and anti-communist upsurge stirred up by the imperialists using the Hungarian incident. Tito's speech attacked almost all socialist countries and the communist parties of many countries, and declared that Yugoslavia would strive in all aspects, attempting to make the "line started by Yugoslavia" victorious in the communist and workers' parties of various countries, in order to overcome the so-called "Stalin line." They also attacked the leaders of many communist and workers' parties in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged revisionists to carry out divisive activities. The U.S. imperialists greatly appreciated these activities. The spokesman of the American bourgeoisie, Lippmann, said at the time that allowing the so-called "Titoism" to "prevail" in socialist countries was the "real interest" of the United States ("Washington Post," October 30, 1956). Richards also believed in a secret meeting held by the leaders of the U.S. Senate that "encouraging Tito and other communist opposition like this is beneficial to our country and the entire free world" ("New York Post," December 31, 1956). May I ask the leaders of the LCY: The U.S. imperialists say that your "ism" is its real interest. Does this not mean that your "ism" meets its needs? You say that the words of the Americans are not credible, but why don't you consider this an "insult" to you and refute it?

Third, in November 1957, the leaders of the LCY abandoned the agreement reached at the Soviet-Yugoslav talks held in Romania and refused to participate in the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and sign the declaration. They declared that this was because the Moscow Declaration "contains some viewpoints that contradict the views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and are considered incorrect by the LCY." This action immediately won the praise of the U.S. imperialists. According to a report by Agence France-Presse on November 22, 1957, "There are clear indications that Yugoslavia's attitude has aroused great interest in the State Department. The general impression in Washington is that Yugoslav President Tito has once again firmly stated that he is independent from the Communist bloc." And after Tito received U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Liddell Berg on December 8, the "New York Times" published an article the next day saying that Tito "indeed mentioned that Yugoslavia's refusal to sign this declaration is further proof that it continues to maintain independence." Immediately afterwards, the United States gave Yugoslavia another huge loan and signed an agreement to supply 62.5 million dollars worth of American surplus agricultural products. Regarding the LCY's refusal to participate in the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and refusal to sign the declaration, the U.S. Information Agency's magazine "Problems of Communism" published an article in its first issue this year by I. Pompon, a bourgeois political commentator who has "quite a lot of contact" with the leading group of the LCY, in which many views are very noteworthy. This article analyzed the real reasons why they refused to participate in the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and refused to sign the declaration based on the remarks of the leading group of the LCY. He said: "Belgrade cannot agree with the two basic theories put forward in the declaration, namely, that the continued tension in the international situation should be entirely blamed on the West, and that the only way to prevent a world catastrophe is for all countries under communist rule to be strongly united to support Moscow's policies and leadership." This estimate made by Pompon, judging from the draft program of the LCY and the remarks made by the leaders of the LCY at the Seventh Congress of the LCY, is consistent with the actual situation. Pompon's article also said: "It is of great significance that when Moscow is trying to strengthen its control over other parts of the communist world again, at least one country that admits to being a disciple of Lenin refuses to yield." The LCY's firm "independence from the Communist bloc" is precisely what U.S. imperialism needs; the two "basic theories" opposed by the leading group of the LCY are precisely what the U.S. imperialists firmly oppose. Does not this position of the leading group of the LCY precisely meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists?

Fourth, at a time when the East wind is prevailing over the West wind and the United States is experiencing a serious economic crisis, the leading group of the LCY has put forward a thorough revisionist program to oppose the Moscow meeting declaration. At the Seventh National Congress of the LCY, they tried their best to defend and fawn on U.S. imperialism, while wantonly attacking the socialist camp; on a series of issues, they spread absurd remarks that violated the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and suited the needs of U.S. imperialism. This is the case both in the analysis of the modern international situation, in the issues of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, in the issue of the leading role of the Communist Party, and in the so-called issue of "anti-dogmatism."

For example, Eisenhower slandered the Soviet Union as "a powerfully armed imperialist dictatorship" (1957 State of the Union Address); the draft program of the LCY also attacked the Soviet Union as "hegemonism." Dulles attacked the Soviet Union's and the socialist camp's foreign policy as a "major threat" to the world (U.S. "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," October 1957); Tito also slandered the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp in his report to the Seventh Congress of the LCY as proceeding from "power politics" and "great power principles." He even slandered that "it was because Stalin implemented a stubborn and unnecessarily threatening foreign policy" that the United States expanded its armaments and established military blocs, and instigated the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Eisenhower and Dulles attacked the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements at all times; the draft program of the LCY also openly opposed the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements.

For another example, in order to paralyze the revolutionary consciousness of the working class, the imperialists always deliberately confuse the fundamental differences between socialism and capitalism. Eisenhower said: Because the government of the capitalist countries "controls" a part of the "economic life" of the bourgeoisie, "this kind of thing will eventually lead to communism, but in our form of government, this kind of thing has been inherent for many years" (June 5, 1957, answer to a reporter of the "New York Herald Tribune"); the draft program of the LCY also emphasized that there are so-called "socialist factors" in capitalist countries. "The special form of state capitalist relations in such countries can be the last effort of capitalism to preserve itself, or it can be the first step towards socialism, or it can be both the former and the latter at the same time."

For another example, the imperialists especially hate the proletarian dictatorship. Dulles cursed the proletarian dictatorship as "tyranny" in his speech at the annual meeting luncheon of the Associated Press on April 22, 1957, and nonsensically claimed that "the vast majority of the people under its rule hate this system and yearn for the establishment of a free society"; the draft program of the LCY also attacked the state of the proletarian dictatorship as the so-called "bureaucracy" and "bureaucratic state totalitarianism," as the so-called "monopolist," saying that it has "changed from the servant and executor of society to the master of society," emphasizing the "antagonistic contradictions" between socialist countries and the masses of the people, and vigorously touting a crudely distorted "theory of the withering away of the state" to undermine the proletarian dictatorship regimes of socialist countries.

For another example, in order to suppress the domestic workers' movement, the imperialists often slander the communist parties of various countries as being "controlled by international communism acting under the guidance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" (Dulles' speech at the Baghdad Pact Council on January 27, 1958); and Tito also slandered in his report to the Seventh Congress of the LCY that the Marxist parties of various countries "implemented a subordinate policy" and "are accustomed to accepting and implementing foreign instructions." The draft program of the LCY even induced workers in the United States and some capitalist countries not to want a Communist Party, nonsensically claiming that "in countries where there is virtually no typical working-class party, such as the United States, the greatest possibility is to organize the working masses in trade unions," believing that this can achieve some kind of "leading role in the political system."

For another example, the imperialists often use the so-called "anti-dogmatism" to attack Marxism-Leninism, nonsensically claiming that "international communism has been plagued by dogmatic difficulties" and slandering communism as "rigid" (Dulles' speech at the annual meeting luncheon of the Associated Press on April 22, 1957); the leading group of the LCY also tried its best to attack the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as "dogma" and absurdly believed that "in recent decades, Marxist thought has lagged behind the development of modern society," saying that some people "attempt to turn it into a simple sum of outdated dogma and abstract truths." The leaders of the LCY also called themselves "irreconcilable enemies of dogmatism" and vigorously touted the so-called "paths to socialism are different," attempting to use this to deny the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and the common laws by which the communist parties of various countries have achieved victory in revolution and construction.

What is especially absurd is that in today's world, when the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism has been thoroughly exposed, Tito praised the United States at the Seventh Congress of the LCY. According to him, the basis of the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia is: "Mutual respect, equal cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs. If there is any attempt that does not conform to this principle, it usually comes from certain individuals or groups, not from the U.S. government." Tito praised in a very grateful tone how U.S. aid helped Yugoslavia overcome huge difficulties. It is really an unprecedented "initiative" for a person who calls himself a communist and revolutionary to support the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, the U.S. imperialists, at his own party's congress. This is probably the "creative contribution" that the leading group of the LCY often boasts about to the cause of international communism!

U.S. imperialism has enthusiastically cheered for the draft program of the LCY and the Seventh Congress of the LCY. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Elbrick testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 3rd of this month that Tito "is doing very well." After seeing the recent actions of the LCY, the imperialist newspapers of the United States said with great elation: "This event once again illustrates Yugoslavia's supreme value as an attractive independent center in the communist world" ("Christian Science Monitor," April 24, 1958, editorial). "Tito's recent explosive actions will certainly have a destructive effect on Soviet foreign policy. The West will benefit from all of this" (U.S. "Newsweek," May 5, 1958).

The Yugoslav revisionists are very unwilling to be said to be serving U.S. imperialism. Of course, if they really turn to the revolutionary position of opposing U.S. imperialism, that is what we welcome. But although they think that the people who tell the truth are "scolding" and "insulting" them, they do not intend to change their position at all. Recently, Yugoslav newspapers have repeated Tito's attitude expressed at the LCY Congress of stubbornly adhering to the revisionist position, saying that "anyone who expects us to give up our principled position on international and domestic issues is just wasting time." It is with this reactionary stubbornness that modern revisionists win the favor of U.S. imperialists!

The struggle against modern revisionism has just begun. In this serious struggle, we must have a clear-cut banner, we must firmly stand on a principled position, we must carry this struggle to the end, and we must not allow the leading group of the LCY to undermine the great cause of Marxism-Leninism!

    南斯拉夫的修正主义恰恰适合美帝国主义者的需要
    康生
    南共领导集团经过南共的修正主义纲领和南共七大向苏联和国际共产主义运动所发动的进攻，已经遭到各国共产党和工人党严正的回击。现在，一场保卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的重大斗争，正在展开。这个斗争，对于国际共产主义运动和保卫世界和平的正义事业，都具有极其重要的意义。
    对于各国共产党提出的批评，南共领导集团至今提不出任何站得住脚的答复，也不可能提出这种答复。他们的所谓答复只是诡辩，例如，把自己为美帝国主义者效劳的丑恶行为说成是“寻找和平和国际合作方针的共同因素”，甚至把这种行为说成同苏联外交政策的目的相一致。他们把南斯拉夫经济对于美国的依赖同苏联关于扩大美苏贸易的建议这两件性质完全不同的事也硬扯在一起。另一方面，他们又把各国马克思列宁主义政党对他们所作的严正的批评，说成是“干涉内政”、“无原则斗争”和“不利于世界和平”。但是事实不是谎言所能够掩盖的。任何一个客观的观察者都能够看出，正是南共领导集团，以它戴着社会主义的面具而替新战争的策划者美帝国主义效劳的政策，对保卫世界和平的正义事业，起着特别有害的作用。也正因为这样，仇视社会主义阵营和仇视和平的美帝国主义者，才会对南斯拉夫大加赞赏。
    南斯拉夫修正主义的出现并不是偶然的。第二次世界大战结束以后，社会主义已经成为一个新的世界体系，美帝国主义者为了挽救资本主义更加深刻的总危机，除了继续利用旧修正主义即社会民主主义这个工具以外，总想从社会主义国家里面寻找新的工具。他们认为，如果能够有一个挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的“社会主义”国家，从内部来分裂社会主义阵营，那是最合乎理想的了。杜勒斯对于南斯拉夫领导集团的政策能够适合美国的需要，是颇具信心的。去年8月6日他在记者招待会上谈到南斯拉夫的时候说：“有一个不被我们叫做‘国际共产主义’或苏联式牌子共产主义所控制的共产党政权，这是可能的。”杜勒斯这句话包括这样的内容：第一，美帝国主义所需要的新工具，应该是不被他们叫做“国际共产主义”的，也就是既要以所谓“共产主义”作标榜，但又是和国际共产主义相对抗的。第二，这个新工具不能是“苏联式牌子共产主义”，也就是要抛弃掉马克思列宁主义的基本原理，抛弃十月革命的道路，并且是和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营相对抗的。第三，这个新工具是要具有以上两个特点的“共产主义”所控制的“政权”。这一点尤其重要，因为在社会主义已经成为世界体系的今天，只有在原先的社会主义国家中取得了政权的修正主义者，才能更有效地为帝国主义效劳。在杜勒斯看来，必须要有这样的“规格”，才是合乎理想的工具，而南斯拉夫修正主义恰恰是符合于杜勒斯的理想的。
    美国大资本家对于培植南斯拉夫修正主义这样一个工具，是不惜巨额投资的。据美国议员诺兰说，美国已经给了铁托政府将近十五亿元的援款（今年3月20日美联社华盛顿电）。大家知道：在长达十五万余言的南共纲领草案中，竟一次也不敢使用“美帝国主义”这个名词，正像回避皇帝的“圣讳”那样。这种情况同样表现在南共领导人的言论中。比方说，铁托在南共七大的报告中这样描写去年美国侵略叙利亚的阴谋：“去年对叙利亚施加压力的后果，加速了埃及和叙利亚的联合……”。关于美国对印度尼西亚的侵略，他说：“印度尼西亚重演了类似的历史。由于某些西方集团的阴谋和对印度尼西亚内政的干涉，年轻的统一的印度尼西亚共和国发生了内战。”总之，好像美帝国主义这个东西在世界上根本不存在！试问：自称为马克思列宁主义的政党可以在分析目前世界形势的时候，连美帝国主义的存在都不敢指出，这如果不是美元起了作用，又能有什么别的解释呢？要知道，在许多主张和平中立的资本主义国家，例如印度、印度尼西亚和阿拉伯联合共和国，它们的许多政治家和政论家并不自称为马克思列宁主义者，但是他们却敢于指责美帝国主义的侵略政策！
    南共领导集团竭力否认他们的纲领恰恰是符合帝国主义者——特别是美帝国主义者的需要。但是，事实胜于雄辩。我们不妨简单地回顾一下近几年来的几件主要的历史事实，就可以看清南斯拉夫修正主义的丑恶面目，看清他们是如何适应美帝国主义者的需要的。
    第一、在匈牙利反革命叛乱事件当中，南共领导集团扮演了一个挑拨者和干涉者的角色。他们公然把反革命叛乱称为革命而加以支持，他们鼓励和支持反革命分子所掌握的“工人委员会”进行反对工农革命政府的活动，并且同叛徒纳吉集团保持密切的联系，对纳吉等反革命分子公开加以庇护，南斯拉夫驻匈大使馆成为这些反革命分子的避难所。只是由于匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导同志在镇压叛乱中和平定叛乱后一贯地坚持了严正的正确的立场，才使他们的阴谋没有得逞，他们才不得不在表面上支持卡达尔为首的匈牙利政府。但是，直到今天，南共领导集团在这个问题上所采取的立场，依然是跟帝国主义、特别是跟美帝国主义互相呼应的。美帝国主义者再三想把所谓“匈牙利问题”列为联合国讨论的议题，妄想经过美帝国主义者所控制的联合国来“突破”匈牙利这个“缺口”。而铁托在南共七次代表大会的报告中，也表示“南斯拉夫主张在联合国解决这个问题”。这难道还不足以说明南共领导集团的主张恰恰符合美帝国主义者的需要吗？
    第二、1956年11月，铁托在普拉发表演说，参加了帝国主义者利用匈牙利事件所掀起的反苏反共高潮。铁托的演说，攻击了几乎所有的社会主义国家和许多国家的共产党，并且宣称南斯拉夫要从各方面努力，企图使“南斯拉夫开始的路线”在各国共产党和工人党内取得胜利，以克服所谓“斯大林路线”。他们还在报刊上攻击许多共产党和工人党的领导，鼓励修正主义分子进行分裂活动。美帝国主义者对于这些活动是十分赞赏的。美国资产阶级代言人李普曼在当时就说，让所谓“铁托主义”在社会主义国家中“普遍流行”，乃是美国的“真正利益”（1956年10月30日“华盛顿邮报”）。理查兹在美国参议院领袖们举行的一次秘密会谈中，也认为“鼓励铁托和其它像这样的共产党反对派对我们国家和整个自由世界是有利的”（1956年12月31日“纽约邮报”）。请问南共领导者们：美帝国主义者说你们的“主义”是它的真正利益，这难道不就是说你们的“主义”适合它的需要吗？你们说美国人的话不足为凭，但是为什么你们并不认为这是对你们的“侮辱”而加以反驳呢？
    第三、1957年11月，南共领导人背弃在罗马尼亚举行的苏南会谈的协议，拒绝参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议和在宣言上签字。他们宣布这是因为莫斯科宣言“包含一些与南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的观点相矛盾并为南共认为不正确的观点和估计”。这一行动马上博得了美帝国主义的赞扬。据法新社1957年11月22日的报道，“有清楚的迹象表明，南斯拉夫的态度在国务院引起了很大兴趣。华盛顿人士普遍的印象是，南斯拉夫总统铁托再一次坚决表示他是脱离共产党集团而独立的。”而在铁托于12月8日接见美国驻南大使李德尔柏格以后，“纽约时报”在次日即发表文章说：铁托“确是提到南斯拉夫拒绝签署这项宣言，是它继续保持独立的又一明证。”紧接着，美国就又给了南斯拉夫一笔巨额贷款，并签订了供给价值六千二百五十万美元的美国剩余农产品的协定。关于南共拒绝参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议和拒绝在宣言上签字，美国新闻署出版的“共产主义问题”杂志在今年的第一期中，发表了一个同南共领导集团“颇多接触”的资产阶级政论家伊·彭庞的文章，其中许多看法是很值得注意的。这篇文章根据南共领导集团的言论，分析了他们拒绝参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议和在宣言上签字的真实原因。他说：“贝尔格莱德对于宣言中提出的两个基本理论不能同意，即国际局势之继续紧张应该全部归咎于西方，以及，唯一防止世界性灾难的办法是所有共产党统治下的国家坚强团结一致支持莫斯科的政策和领导”。彭庞所作的这一估计，从南共纲领草案和南共领导人在南共七次大会上的言论中看来，是和实际情况相符的。彭庞的文章还说：“有重大意义的是：当莫斯科正企图再次加强控制共产主义世界的其它部分时，至少有一个承认是列宁的门徒的国家拒绝屈服。”南共坚决“脱离共产党集团而独立”，正是美帝国主义所需要的；南共领导集团反对的这两个“基本理论”，也正是美帝国主义者所坚决反对的。南共领导集团的这种立场，不正是恰恰符合美帝国主义者的需要么？
    第四、在东风压倒西风、美国正在经历着严重经济危机的时候，南共领导集团又提出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，来同莫斯科会议宣言相对抗。他们在南共第七次全国代表大会上，对美帝国主义竭力辩护和逢迎，而对社会主义阵营则肆意攻击；在一系列的问题上，散布违背马克思列宁主义基本原理、适合于美帝国主义所需要的荒谬言论。不论在关于现代国际形势的分析上，在关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的问题上，在关于共产党的领导作用问题上，在所谓“反对教条主义”的问题上，都是如此。
    例如，艾森豪威尔诬蔑苏联是“一个有力地武装起来的帝国主义独裁政权”（1957年国情咨文）；南共纲领草案也攻击苏联是“霸权主义”。杜勒斯攻击苏联和社会主义阵营的对外政策是全世界的“重大威胁”（美国“外交季刊”，1957年10月号）；铁托在南共第七次代表大会的报告中也诬蔑苏联和社会主义阵营的对外政策是从“实力政策”“大国原则”出发的。他甚至诬蔑说什么“由于斯大林执行顽固的和不必要的威胁性外交政策”，才是美国扩军备战和建立军事集团、策动签订北大西洋公约的原因。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯时时刻刻都在攻击雅尔塔和波茨坦协议；南共纲领草案也公开反对雅尔塔和波茨坦协议。
    又如，帝国主义者为了麻痹工人阶级革命意识，总是故意混淆社会主义和资本主义两种制度的根本区别。艾森豪威尔说：由于资本主义国家的政府“控制”了一部分资产阶级的“经济生活”，“这种事情最后会导向共产主义，但是，在我们的政府形式中，这种东西也是许多年以来所固有的”（1957年6月5日答“纽约先驱论坛报”记者）；南共纲领草案也强调在资本主义国家中有所谓“社会主义因素”，这种国家中的“国家资本主义关系的特殊形式可以是资本主义保全自己的最后努力，也可以是走向社会主义的第一步，也可以同时既是前者也是后者。”
    又如，帝国主义者特别仇恨无产阶级专政，杜勒斯在1957年4月22日美联社年会午宴会上的演说中咒骂无产阶级专政是“暴政”，胡说什么“受它统治的绝大多数人民都憎恨这种制度，渴望建立一个自由的社会”；南共纲领草案也攻击无产阶级专政的国家是所谓“官僚主义”和“官僚主义的国家极权主义”，是所谓“垄断者”，说它已经“由社会的公仆和执行人变为社会的主子”，强调社会主义国家和人民群众之间的“对抗性矛盾”，并且大肆鼓吹一种被粗暴地歪曲了的“国家消亡论”，来破坏社会主义阵营各国的无产阶级专政的政权。
    又如，帝国主义者为了镇压国内的工人运动，常常诬蔑各国共产党受到“根据苏联共产党指导行事的国际共产主义的控制”（1958年1月27日杜勒斯在巴格达条约理事会上讲话）；而铁托在南共七大的报告中也诬蔑各国的马克思主义政党“执行了从属性的政策”，“习惯于接受和贯彻外来的指示”，南共纲领草案甚至还劝诱美国和某些资本主义国家的工人不要共产党，胡说什么“在实际上不存在什么典型工人阶级政党的国家里，譬如美国，最大的可能就是把工人群众组织在工会里，”认为这样就可以取得什么“政权制度中的领导作用”。
    又如，帝国主义者常常利用所谓“反对教条主义”来攻击马克思列宁主义，胡说什么“国际共产主义已经被教条方面的困难所缠扰”，诬蔑共产主义是“呆板的”（杜勒斯在1957年4月22日在美联社年会午宴会上的演说）；南共领导集团也竭力攻击马克思列宁主义基本原理为“教条”，并且荒谬地认为“近几十年来马克思主义思想落后于现代社会的发展了”，说有人“企图把它变为陈腐的教条和抽象真理的简单总和”，南共领导人还自称为“教条主义的不可调和的敌人”，竭力鼓吹所谓“走上社会主义的道路是各不相同的”，企图借此否定马列主义的普遍真理，否定各国共产党取得革命和建设胜利的共同规律。
    尤其荒谬的，是在美帝国主义者的凶恶面目已经彻底暴露的今天，铁托却在南共第七次代表大会上对美国歌功颂德。据他说，美国同南斯拉夫的关系的基础是：“相互尊重，平等合作和互不干涉内政。如果有某种不符合这一原则的企图的话，那通常是来自某些个人或集团，而不是来自美国政府。”铁托用十分感激的语调，歌颂美援如何帮助南斯拉夫克服了巨大的困难。自称为共产主义者、革命者的人竟在自己党的代表大会上替全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义者捧场，这实在是一件史无前例的“创举”。这大概就是南共领导集团常常夸说的他们对于国际共产主义事业的“创造性贡献”了！
    美帝国主义已经热烈地为南共纲领草案和南共第七次代表大会喝彩了。美国负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿埃尔布里克本月3日在参议院外交委员会作证时说：铁托“做得很不错”。美国的帝国主义报刊，在看到南共的最近的行动以后，兴高彩烈地说道：“这一事件再度说明，南斯拉夫在共产主义世界内作为一个有吸引力的独立中心的无上价值”（“基督教科学箴言报”，1958年4月24日社论）。“铁托最近爆炸性的行动肯定会对苏联外交政策发生破坏作用。西方会从所有这一切当中得到好处”（1958年5月5日美国“新闻周刊”）。
    南斯拉夫的修正主义者非常不愿意别人说他们是为美帝国主义效劳。当然，如果他们真的转到反对美帝国主义的革命立场上来，那是我们所欢迎的。但是他们尽管认为说实话的人们是“谩骂”、“侮辱”了他们，却又丝毫不打算改变他们的立场。最近南斯拉夫报刊重复了铁托在南共代表大会上所表明的顽固地坚持修正主义立场的态度，说什么“任何人如果指望我们放弃我们在国际问题和国内问题上的原则性立场，那只是浪费时间”。现代修正主义者就是以这种反动的顽强性博取美帝国主义者的欢心的！
    对现代修正主义的斗争方才开始。我们在这一场严肃的斗争中，必须旗帜鲜明，必须坚定地站在原则性的立场上，必须把这一斗争进行到底，不容许南共领导集团来破坏马克思列宁主义的伟大事业！
