	Fishing Island Storm
	—The Struggle of the Maldivian People Against British Bases
	Gao Liang
	The waves of the Indian Ocean roar day and night. The Maldives Islands stand firm in the wind and waves, like countless solid bunkers. Hundreds of thousands of fishermen on the islands are engaged in an unyielding struggle against imperialists building military bases on their land.

	Located 417 miles southwest of Ceylon, the Maldives Islands, composed of thousands of islands of various sizes, are scattered like a string of pearls on the chest of the Indian Ocean. They are 470 miles long from north to south and 70 miles wide from east to west. For more than two thousand years, fishermen who gradually migrated from Ceylon, India, and Arab countries have thrived on the islands, relying on their hard work and the gifts of nature. The sea is rich in fish, and the islands are densely covered with tall coconut trees. It is said that Mulaku Island in the archipelago is entirely made of magnetic ore, and passing ships will be attracted to it and unable to move if they get too close.

	As early as more than two thousand years ago, magnificent Buddhist temples were built on the Maldives Islands. The remains of these buildings still radiate the brilliance of Eastern civilization. The islanders are skilled in handicrafts, and they weave various exquisite crafts from grass. The beautiful black-skinned girls, wearing robes embroidered with colorful lace, are as crystal clear as sea pearls. The fishermen, hardened by storms, can build and sail large ships dozens of feet long, navigating smoothly on the sea. They speak different languages such as Sinhalese, Urdu, and Arabic. Most people believe in Islam, and a few believe in Buddhism, but for generations, they have lived together peacefully.

	Like other small and weak nations in the East, the Maldivian people have been subjected to barbaric aggression and cruel exploitation by Western colonialists in modern times. As early as the mid-16th century, Portugal invaded and occupied the archipelago. At the end of the 18th century, British colonialists occupied it again. The inhabitants of the archipelago have long been regarded as worthless "savages" by Western colonialists. Although they worked hard, they lived a slave-like life. However, the Maldivian people were never willing to be slaves. They waged a long and heroic struggle against the colonialists for independence and freedom, even forcing the British to refrain from stationing people on the islands for long periods and entrusting the rule of the archipelago to the British Governor in Ceylon. After the Second World War, with the independence of Ceylon, the people of the Maldives Islands were freed from British enslavement.

	British colonialists have always been unwilling to give up their control over the archipelago. They took advantage of the natural and excellent terrain of Gan Island in the archipelago to establish a naval and air force base. After the Trincomalee naval base was taken back by the Ceylonese government last year, Britain strengthened its military presence on Gan Island and even attempted to expand the military base to other islands.

	For eight hundred years, the Maldives Islands were ruled by the Didhi royal family hereditarily. About thirty years ago, when King Hassan Izzadin Didhi was in power, two pro-British ministers, Mu Farid and Amin Didhi, killed the king and made themselves king and prime minister. Soon, the fishermen on the island killed Amin Didhi, and the British immediately supported another Ibrahim Didhi as prime minister. They took advantage of his reign to build and expand the base on Gan Island. The fishermen watched with hatred as the colonialists dug up their ancestral graves while building the base. At the end of last year, while people were celebrating the festival under the moonlight in the palace with wild drinking and dancing, angry fishermen secretly gathered, disguised themselves, and infiltrated the palace under the leadership of their chiefs. They captured the pro-British king and prime minister and immediately elected Nasir, a member of the Didhi royal family in his twenties, as prime minister. With the support of the masses, Nasir bravely led the people in the struggle against the British construction of bases until now.

	Throughout Ceylon, there are many moving stories circulating about the Maldivian people's struggle against the establishment of British bases. According to people from the island, whenever British soldiers stationed on Gan Island wanted to land on other islands to establish military bases, the fishermen, even the elderly, women, and children, would come to the seaside in formation with knives, axes, and stones, shouting: British soldiers are not allowed to land. If they land, we will fight to the death. There are also reports that the British sent some priests to the island to give the fishermen sweets and "relief supplies," but the fishermen threw these things on the ground and rejected such "charity."

	In March of this year, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held a meeting in Manila, claiming to link the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty and the Baghdad Pact. In this way, the Maldives Islands became an ideal springboard in the eyes of the British and Americans. They colluded with each other and decided to expand the base on the island.

	Soon, the British High Commissioner to Ceylon went to the Maldives Islands in an attempt to use force to compel Prime Minister Nasir to recognize the treaties previously signed between the pro-British authorities of the Maldives Islands and Britain, allowing Britain to expand the base on the island. It is said that this High Commissioner came to the shore of Male Island, the capital of the Maldives Islands, on a warship, ordered the warship to fire a cannon in a show of force, and used a loudspeaker to shout to the island, demanding that Prime Minister Nasir come to negotiate.

	At this time, the fishermen on Male Island immediately gathered and demonstrated with black flags, and the angry cries were like surging waves, shaking the heavens and the earth. Prime Minister Nasir sent a representative to tell this "majestic" British High Commissioner that they should not think of using threats to subdue them. The Maldivians would never sign a treaty selling their territory, never recognize the right of the British to establish a military base on Gan Island, and even more would not allow Britain and the United States to expand bases on other islands.

	Faced with such firm resistance, the High Commissioner did not even dare to go ashore and returned to Ceylon in disappointment.

	The struggle of the Maldivian people has received the support of the people of Ceylon and the people of Asian countries. At a mass rally held by the Colombo Peace Committee, the reporter personally heard a speech from a representative from the Maldives, who used infinitely sad and angry words to describe the past suffering of the fishermen on the island and their determination to fight to the end. He called on people all over the world to give their support. The conference unanimously passed a resolution condemning the British and American establishment of military bases on the Maldives Islands, believing that this was a serious threat to Ceylon and peace-loving countries in Southeast Asia. The meeting firmly demanded an immediate cessation of this act of aggression.

	The struggle against British and American aggression launched by hundreds of thousands of fishermen in the Maldives is as turbulent as the waves in the Indian Ocean. It declares to the world that even on such small islands, the people have awakened, and they dare to stand up to defend peace and sovereignty, and will never allow their land to become a military base for imperialists.

    渔岛风暴
    ——马尔代夫人民反对英国基地的斗争
    高梁
    印度洋的海浪日夜呼啸着。马尔代夫群岛挺立在风浪之中，犹如无数坚固的碉堡。岛上的几十万渔民，为反对帝国主义者在他们的土地上建筑军事基地，进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    在锡兰西南四百一十七英里，由成千成百个大小岛屿组成的马尔代夫群岛，像一串珍珠，散列在印度洋的胸膛上。它南北长四百七十英里，东西宽七十英里。两千多年以来，从锡兰、印度、阿拉伯国家逐渐迁徙而来的渔民，靠着辛勤的劳动和自然的赋予，在岛上繁殖生息。大海里有着丰富的鱼产，岛上密生着高大的椰林。群岛之中的毛拉都岛，据说全是磁性矿石，过往的轮船如果靠近该岛，就会被它吸住而行动不得。
    早在两千多年前，马尔代夫群岛上便建立了壮丽的佛教庙宇，这些建筑物的遗迹，至今仍放射着东方文明的异彩。岛上居民手艺精巧，他们用草编出各种精美的工艺品。美丽的黑皮肤的姑娘，穿着绣有五彩花边的长袍，像海珠一般晶莹。久经风暴的渔民，能够制造和驾驶十几丈长的艨艟大船，在海上平稳地航行。他们操着僧伽罗语、乌尔都语和阿拉伯语等不同的语言，多数人信奉回教，少数人信奉佛教，但世世代代以来，他们都在一起和平地生活着。
    像东方其他弱小民族一样，马尔代夫人民近代以来遭到西方殖民者野蛮的侵略和残酷的剥削。早在十六世纪中叶，葡萄牙便侵占了这个群岛。十八世纪末，英国殖民者又占领了它。群岛的居民，长久以来被西方殖民者当成一钱不值的“野蛮人”，虽然辛勤劳动，却过着奴隶般的生活。但是，马尔代夫人民决不甘心做奴隶，他们为争取独立自由，同殖民者进行了长期的英勇搏斗，甚至使英国人不敢派人久留岛上，而把群岛委托给英国驻锡兰的总督统治。第二次世界大战后，随着锡兰的独立，马尔代夫群岛的人民也就从英国的奴役下解脱出来。
    英国殖民者一直不愿放弃它对这个群岛的控制。它利用群岛中“干恩”岛的天然优良地势，建立了海空军基地。在亭可马里海军基地去年被锡兰政府收回后，英国便在“干恩”岛上增强军事力量，并且还企图把军事基地扩建到其他岛屿上去。
    八百年来，马尔代夫岛原是由迪地国王家族世袭地统治着。大约三十年前，当哈桑·依扎丁·迪地国王执政时，两个亲英的大臣，穆·法里德和阿明·迪地，杀死了这位国王，自己作了国王和首相。不久，岛上的渔民把阿明·迪地杀死，英国人即刻扶植了另一个伊布拉辛·迪地作首相，并且趁他执政期间，修筑和扩充了“干恩”岛上的基地。渔民用仇恨的眼睛，看着殖民者在修筑基地时挖掉他们的祖坟。在去年底，当人们在王宫的月夜下欢度节日狂饮狂舞的时候，愤怒的渔民暗暗集合起来，在自己首领的率领下，化装混进宫来，擒了亲英的国王和首相，立即推选了迪地王室的家族、二十几岁的纳希尔为首相。纳希尔在群众的拥护下，英勇地领导人民进行着反对英国修建基地的斗争，直到如今。
    在锡兰，到处传布着马尔代夫人民在反对建立英国基地斗争中涌现的许许多多可歌可泣的故事。据岛上来的人叙述，每当驻扎在“干恩”岛上的英国兵要在其他岛屿上登陆建立军事基地时，岛上的渔民，甚至老人、妇女和孩子，都拿着刀子、斧头和石块，列队来到海边，呐喊着：决不允许英国兵上岸，如果上岸，就要拚命。还有消息说，英国人曾派一些神甫来到岛上向渔民施舍糖果、“救济品”，但渔民把这些东西丢在地上，拒绝了这样的“慈善”。
    今年3月间，东南亚条约组织在马尼拉举行会议，扬言要把东南亚条约和巴格达条约成员国连在一起。这样，马尔代夫群岛就成了英美心目中理想的跳板，他们互相勾通，决定扩大岛上基地。
    不久，英国驻锡兰的高级专员去到马尔代夫岛，企图用武力迫使纳希尔首相承认以前马尔代夫岛亲英当局同英国签订的条约，允许英国在岛上扩建基地。据说，这位高级专员乘军舰来到马尔代夫群岛首都马里岛的岸旁，命令军舰鸣炮示威，并用扩音器向岛上喊话，要纳希尔首相前来谈判。
    这时，马里岛上的渔民立即打着黑旗集会示威，愤怒的呼声像海浪汹涌，震动天地。纳希尔首相派代表来告诉这位“威风十足”的英国高级专员说：休想用威胁的手段使我们屈服，马尔代夫人决不签定出卖自己领土的条约，决不承认英国人在“干恩”岛建立军事基地的权利，更不允许英国和美国在其他岛屿上扩充基地。
    面对着这样坚决的抵抗，这位高级专员连岸也不敢上，扫兴地转回锡兰。
    马尔代夫人民的斗争得到锡兰人民和亚洲各国人民的支持。在科伦坡和平委员会举行的一次群众集会上，记者亲自听到来自马尔代夫的一位代表的发言，他用无限悲愤的词句述说岛上渔民过去的苦难和他们斗争到底的决心。他呼吁全世界人民给以支持。大会一致通过了决议，谴责英美在马尔代夫岛上建立军事基地，认为这是对锡兰和东南亚爱好和平国家的严重威胁。会议坚决要求立即停止这种侵略的行为。
    马尔代夫几十万渔民掀起的反对英美侵略的斗争，正像印度洋里的波涛一样汹涌澎湃，它向全世界宣告：即使在这样小小的岛屿上，人民也已经觉醒，他们敢于起来维护和平与主权，决不让自己的土地成为帝国主义者的军事基地。
