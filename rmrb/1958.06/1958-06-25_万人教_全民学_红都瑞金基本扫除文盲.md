    Ten Thousand People Teach, All People Learn
    Ruijin, the Red Capital, Basically Eliminates Illiteracy
    The people of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, through sixteen days of hard study and hard work, have basically eliminated illiteracy.

    Before liberation, the people of Ruijin suffered under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, lacking food and clothing. Ninety percent of the young and middle-aged population were illiterate, and many villages could not find a single literate person. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people's economic lives improved, and they had the desire to learn culture. In a few years, more than 10,000 young and middle-aged people in the county shed their illiterate status. Last winter and this spring, with the great leap forward in production, the people felt an even greater need for culture. The Ruijin County Party Committee seized on the masses' urgent need for culture and launched a vigorous mass literacy campaign throughout the county in May. In the movement, a scene of "ten thousand people teaching, all people learning" emerged throughout the county. All literate people in the county were organized to be teachers, and all young and middle-aged illiterate people participated in learning. Many veteran Red Army soldiers also joined the literacy movement. They learned in the fields, in their homes, in the morning, at night, and before and after meetings. The content of learning was to learn what characters related to what agricultural work they were doing. Many places adopted the method of recognizing characters through objects, which was not only easy to learn but also made a deep impression and was easy to remember. In this way, in the sixteen days of the second half of May, 83% of the young and middle-aged people in the county learned 1,500 characters, basically eliminating illiteracy throughout the county.

    万人教　全民学
    红都瑞金基本扫除文盲
    江西瑞金县人民苦学苦战十六天，基本上扫除了文盲。
    解放前瑞金人民由于受国民党反动派的摧残，衣食无着，有90％的青壮年是文盲，许多村庄找不到一个识字的人。解放后，人民在党的领导下，经济生活改善了，有了学习文化的要求，几年内全县有一万多青壮年摘下了文盲帽子。去冬今春，生产大跃进，人民更感到了对文化的需要。中共瑞金县委抓住了群众对文化的迫切要求，5月份在全县范围内掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的扫盲运动。在运动中全县出现了“万人教、全民学”的景象，全县所有识字的人都组织起来当教师，所有青壮年文盲都参加学习，许多红军老战士也投入识字运动。他们利用田间学，屋里学，早晨学，夜晚学，会前会后学。学习内容是做什么农活，学什么字。不少地方采用见物识字的方法，不仅易学，而且印象深、记得牢。这样，在5月下半月的十六天内，全县83％的青壮年都认识了一千五百个字，基本上扫除了全县的文盲。
