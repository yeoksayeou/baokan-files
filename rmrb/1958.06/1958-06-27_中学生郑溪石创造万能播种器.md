Middle school student Zheng Xishi, from Zhangzhou Second Middle School in Fujian, is only seventeen years old. While participating in peanut planting, he felt that he could only plant a little over two fen of land per day, which was too slow. He started thinking hard and diligently researching. With the support of the school's Party branch, he finally created a universal seeder that can automatically dig soil, sow seeds, and cover the soil, suitable for planting rice, wheat, corn, and peanuts. It improves efficiency by thirty times compared to manual sowing. At the same time, he also created a mountain wheelbarrow, which is easy to use and suitable for transportation in mountainous areas. A person who can carry more than seventy jin can use the mountain wheelbarrow to transport more than four hundred jin.

    中学生郑溪石创造万能播种器
    福建漳州二中学生郑溪石，只有十七岁。他在参加生产播种花生时，感到一天只能播种二分多土地，速度太慢，就开动了脑筋，刻苦钻研，在学校党支部的支持下，终于创造一种既能自动挖土，又能播种、埋土，适合于播种稻、麦、玉米、花生的万能播种器，比人工播种提高效率三十倍；同时还创造一架上山独轮车，使用轻便，适合山区运输。一个能挑七十多斤的人，使用上山独轮车就能推运四百多斤。
