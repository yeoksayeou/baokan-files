Relying on Farm Workers to Develop Wastelands Extensively
		Lin Jinzhang

Since liberation, the state has reclaimed many wastelands into fertile fields. The agricultural reclamation system alone has established more than 700 large state-owned farms, producing many commodities such as cotton, grain, soybeans, meat, and dairy products.

This year, the leap forward targets of state-owned farms are equivalent to the total of the past eight years. The leap forward targets for land reclamation, agriculture, and animal husbandry production in 1958 were continuously revised and increased by the farm workers of the national agricultural reclamation system under the surging enthusiasm for the leap forward. For example, the planned reclamation area of 20 million mu is equivalent to the total area reclaimed in the past eight years, and the cotton production target (total output) is also equivalent to the total of the past eight years. The production targets for grain and meat have both increased by one to two times compared to 1957. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps plans to reclaim about one million mu more this year than in the past eight years. The land reclamation and cotton planting area of various state-owned farms in Hubei Province will be several times more than the total of the past eight years. The Mishan Reclamation Area in Heilongjiang Province originally planned to reclaim 3.3 million mu this year, but now it has been increased to 5 million to 6 million mu. The leap forward in land reclamation and production of state-owned farms and ranches in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, Hebei, Shandong, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions is basically the same.

In previous years, the period before the end of April was generally the preparation stage for spring plowing and land reclamation. This year, except for Heilongjiang Province, where the thaw was late and land reclamation started later, other regions have already reclaimed a large amount of wasteland. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, national farms had reclaimed more than 3 million mu of wasteland, equivalent to the reclamation area of the past year. Judging from the actual leap forward effect of spring land reclamation and production, this year's leap forward target is reliable. As long as various effective measures are followed up in a timely manner and new difficulties are constantly overcome, the leap forward target can be completed, and many farms can overfulfill it.

This year, more wasteland has been reclaimed, but investment has decreased, with investment being more than half less compared to the reclamation area. Moreover, a lot of these investment expenditures are still used for the basic construction of agricultural and livestock product processing industries run by the farms. This year, state-owned farms generally asked the state for less investment. For example, the newly built Guangming Farm in Guangdong only asked for a small amount of investment and reclaimed a large amount of wasteland. The Xinjiang and Mishan Reclamation Areas plan to reclaim about 20 million mu from next year to 1962, and all investment will rely on the farms' own accumulation and will not be requested from the state.

This year, the increase in tractors in the national agricultural reclamation system is not proportional to the increase in land reclamation area as in the past. This year, the land reclamation area exceeded the total of the past eight years, but the increase in tractors is less than 40% of the total in the past eight years.

Another aspect of the leap forward in state-owned farms this year is the leap forward in production and management, which has changed the long-term losses of some state-owned farms. This year, state-owned farms have greatly strengthened their production measures. Farm water conservancy is better constructed than in the past, and irrigation and drainage have been further guaranteed; the application of fertilizers has generally increased by about one time compared to the past; and the intensive cultivation and fine farming in land preparation and sowing have been strengthened compared to the past. More importantly, this year, in order to properly arrange labor and better exert the strength of equipment, various farms have greatly developed diversified operations, and built and expanded a considerable number of large and small processing plants. Some reclamation areas have built dozens or hundreds of processing plants. There is no doubt that with the development of diversified operations, the output value of state-owned farms has increased accordingly, and the productivity of each mu of land and each laborer on the farm has been improved even higher.

In the past, some farms had long-term losses or unstable profits and losses, mainly due to poor management, insufficient output due to not implementing the policy of intensive cultivation and fine farming, and less operation and production, which meant labor and equipment were not fully utilized. This situation has changed during the leap forward. For example, the Xijiang Farm in Guangxi, the Guangbei Farm in Shandong, the Chahayang Farm in Heilongjiang, and the Lingwu Farm in Ningxia, which had almost annual operating losses, are confident of turning losses into profits this year and becoming high-profit farms with more products, higher output, and higher output value due to increased production measures, improved operating methods, and diversified operations. As for the profitable farms that originally implemented the policy of running farms diligently and thriftily and had better management, such as the farms in the Mishan Reclamation Area in Heilongjiang, the Xiaoguai Farm and the Maigaiti Farm in Xinjiang, the Xidongting Lake Farm in Hunan, the Fengxian Farm in Jiangsu, the Zhanyu Farm in Jilin, and the Andong Farm in Liaoning, they will achieve higher profits this year by further developing diversified operations and strengthening production increase measures.

In the leap forward of land reclamation and production of state-owned farms, the role of the masses was particularly emphasized. Facts have proved that the revolutionary drive of the vast number of employees of state-owned farms has soared after ideological liberation and breaking with conventions, and things that were considered impossible in the past have been achieved this year. For example, in the past, it was believed that land reclamation and farm construction could not be carried out without complete surveying and mapping and land reclamation and farm construction design task books; this year, the method of surveying, designing, and building the farm at the same time was adopted, and the wasteland was also reclaimed and planted with grain and cotton. In some places, where there was no surveying and design force, they also overcame difficulties and started land reclamation and production while surveying and designing themselves. In the past, it was believed that land reclamation could not be carried out without tractors. This year, some newly established farms in the south borrowed tractors that were idle during the winter slack season in the north and also reclaimed a lot of wasteland. In the past, the right-leaning conservative thoughts of being overwhelmed by insufficient objective conditions and insufficient subjective strength were powerfully criticized in the practice of land reclamation and production leap forward this year.

Under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the vast number of employees of state-owned farms will go all out, aim high, and reclaim wasteland, build farms, and produce more, faster, better, and more economically, develop the vast wasteland of the motherland, and build a powerful socialist state-owned agricultural and pastoral industry.

    依靠农场职工大量开发荒原
    林锦章
    解放以来国家已经把不少荒地垦成了良田，仅农垦系统就建立了七百多个大型国营农场，生产了很多商品棉花、粮食、大豆、肉类、乳酪等产品。
    今年国营农场的跃进指标有的相当于过去八年的总和。1958年的开荒、农业、畜牧业生产跃进指标，是全国农垦系统农场职工在高涨的跃进热情下不断修正提高的。如计划开荒面积二千万亩就相当于过去八年所开荒地的总和，棉花的生产指标（总产）也相当于过去八年的总和，粮食、肉类的生产指标都比1957年增加一倍到两倍。新疆生产建设兵团今年计划开荒面积要比过去八年开的荒多一百万亩左右。湖北省各国营农场的开荒、植棉面积要比过去八年总和多好几倍。黑龙江省密山垦区原计划今年开荒三百三十万亩，现在增加到五百万亩到六百万亩。江西、湖南、广西、云南、甘肃、青海、河北、山东、内蒙古等省区国营农、牧场开荒生产跃进情况，基本上都是这样的。
    往年4月底以前一般还是春耕和开荒的准备阶段，今年除了黑龙江省开冻较晚才开始开荒外，其他各地都已经开出了大量荒地。根据不完全的统计，到5月底，全国农场已经开垦出荒地三百万亩以上，相当于过去一年的开荒面积。从春季开荒和生产实际跃进效果来看，今年的跃进指标是可靠的。只要今后各种有效措施不误农时地跟上去，不断克服各种新的困难，跃进指标是可以完成的，许多农场可以超额完成的。
    今年开荒多而投资却减少了，与开荒面积相比较投资少了一半以上。而且这些投资支出中很多还是用于农场兴办农畜产品加工工业的基本建设上。今年一般国营农场都向国家少要了投资，如广东新建的光明农场只要了很少的投资就开了大量的荒地。新疆、密山垦区拟从明年起到1962年开荒二千万亩左右，全部投资依靠农场本身积累，都不向国家要了。
    今年全国农垦系统的农场增加的拖拉机也不是像过去按开荒面积的比例增加的。今年开荒面积超过过去八年的总和，而拖拉机增加不到过去八年总数的40％。
    今年国营农场跃进的另一个方面，就是生产上的跃进，经营管理方面的跃进，其结果，改变了有些国营农场长期亏损的局面。今年国营农场在生产措施方面大大加强了。农场的水利比过去建设得更好，排灌都得到了进一步的保证；肥料的施用，一般都比过去增加一倍左右；整地、播种的精耕细作方面都比过去加强了。更重要的是今年各农场为了妥善安排劳动力与更好发挥设备力量，多种经营有很大的发展，增建和扩建相当数量的大小型加工厂，有的垦区增建几十个几百个加工厂。毫无疑问，随着多种经营的发展，国营农场的产值相应地增加了，农场每亩土地每个劳动力的生产率因而提得更高。
    过去有些农场长期亏损或者盈亏不稳定，除了管理不善外，主要是没有贯彻精耕细作的方针，产量不够高，和经营生产少，劳动力和设备得不到充分的发挥。跃进中这个局面已经改变了。比如几乎历年经营亏损的广西西江农场、山东广北农场、黑龙江查哈阳农场、宁夏灵武农场等等，由于增强了生产措施，改善了经营方法，实行了多种经营后，都有把握在今年变亏损为盈利，成为产品多、产量高、产值高的高额盈利农场。至于原来就贯彻勤俭办场方针较好、经营较好的盈利的农场，如黑龙江密山垦区各农场，新疆小拐农场和麦盖提农场，湖南西洞庭湖农场，江苏奉贤农场，吉林瞻榆农场等，辽宁安东农场，它们今年进一步开展了多种经营，加强了增产措施，就将取得更高的盈利。
    国营农场开荒和生产的跃进中，特别强调了群众的作用。事实证明：国营农场广大职工思想解放打破陈规后革命干劲高涨，过去认为做不到的事情，今年做到了。比如过去认为在开荒前没有完整的勘测与开荒建场设计任务书，就不能进行开荒建场；今年采取边勘测、边设计、边建场的办法也把荒开了，并且种上了粮食、棉花。有的地方没有勘察设计力量，也克服困难自己动手边勘察设计边开荒生产了。过去认为没有拖拉机就不能开荒，今年南方有些新办农场借用北方冬闲时闲着的拖拉机也开了不少荒地。过去慑于客观条件不够，主观力量不足等裹足不前的右倾保守思想，在今年开荒生产跃进的实践中，受到了有力批驳。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，国营农场的广大职工将鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地开荒、建场和生产，开发祖国的辽阔荒原，建设社会主义的强大的国营农牧业。
