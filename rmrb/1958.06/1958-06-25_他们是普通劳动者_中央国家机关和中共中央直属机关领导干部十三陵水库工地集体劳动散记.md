They Are Ordinary Laborers
——A Brief Record of the Collective Labor of Leading Cadres from Central State Organs and Directly Subordinate Organs of the CPC Central Committee at the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site
By our correspondent Yuan Mu
The scorching sun beats down, the hot wind scorches, and the sand grains underfoot are burning hot. Comrade Zhou Enlai, leading the way with a bright red flag, led a labor team composed of leading cadres from central state organs and directly subordinate organs of the CPC Central Committee, heading towards their labor site at the flood-control dam of the Ming Tombs Reservoir.

This is a red flag symbolizing the lofty communist style. For more than a week, more than five hundred leading comrades have been working hard here in the guise of ordinary laborers, shedding their sweat.

Every day at 3 p.m., at the sound of a silver whistle, people immediately leap up from their adjacent beds, line up and set off. Whether it's the Premier, ministers, vice ministers, bureau chiefs, or even the site technicians, health workers, or administrative staff, everyone walks eight li to work together, chatting and laughing along the way. It is not until 11 p.m. that people return to their residence, carrying the myriad lights of the reservoir dam. Sometimes, this team meets the young reservoir builders on the road, and the mischievous young people deliberately provoke a battle: "Team Huang Zhong, sing a song!" The "old men" are not to be outdone, and seeing the young people from afar, they strive to take the initiative: "Young lads, let's have one!" In this enthusiastic call and laughter of mutual challenge, cheerful songs ripple in the hot wind.

Here are no Leaders

On the first day, Bai Shou Kang, political commissar of the Shaxi section of the reservoir headquarters, was invited to assign tasks and give instructions. He had just uttered the first sentence, "We welcome the leaders..." when Comrade Zhou Enlai immediately corrected him: "There are no leaders here, no positions of Premier, ministers, or bureau chiefs. Everyone here is an ordinary laborer." Comrade Wang Zhen immediately added to Bai Shou Kang: "Now you are the leader, and we are your subordinates."

It is very difficult to express truthfully the joyful and boiling atmosphere on the construction site, the loving feelings of our respected leading comrades for labor, and their drive. The scorching sun makes the stones hot to the touch, but people not only ignore it, but also happily call the big stones "watermelons" and the small stones "cantaloupes," while rhythmically shouting such slogans: "Hey! Here comes a big watermelon!" "Here comes a small cantaloupe!" and quickly transport the stones to the stockpile. Dozens of wheelbarrows loaded with stones move nimbly on the construction site, and people carry stone baskets as they stride swiftly. Almost everyone in this labor team, with an average age of over forty-five, wants to compete in labor.

Comrade Zhou Enlai practiced pushing a cart alone before the collective labor began. Our respected Premier broke his right arm in a fall from a horse during the past revolutionary war, and even now his arm cannot be fully straightened. Although people repeatedly dissuaded him, he insisted on pushing a few carts of stone after doing loading, pulling carts and other work, wanting to learn this kind of labor. Comrade Luo Ruiqing repeatedly told everyone to pay attention to safety, work according to their ability, and move forward steadily. But as soon as he arrived at the construction site, he forgot his own admonitions to others and worked harder and harder. The captains of the first and second detachments, Comrades Chen Guodong and Yu Guangsheng, are strong and healthy, wearing shorts and sneakers. They are the "young and strong faction" on the construction site. They not only command well, but also take the lead in laboring well. Gong Zirong, secretary of the Party Committee of the Central State Organs, serves as the political commissar of the detachment here. He and Lian Guan are a famous pair of "short and fat guys" on the construction site. They have always insisted on carrying stone baskets, never slacking, and people praise their perseverance in labor. Li Baohua's hand was broken by a stone and bled, but he insisted on not leaving the front line with minor injuries, and after bandaging it, he worked even harder.

Unforgettable images

There are several images on the construction site that people will never forget: Comrade Wang Xingrang, who lost an arm in his early years, sometimes lifts a stone basket weighing dozens of pounds with one hand, loading and unloading materials with others without stopping; sometimes he carries a pair of stone baskets, quickly and steadily; sometimes he helps others pull carts, moving forward bravely. Sweat soaked his clothes. While working, he talked and laughed loudly with others, or hummed songs in a low voice. How much joy does ordinary labor bring to this tireless person! Everyone on the construction site respectfully calls him the "one-armed hero." Comrade Zhang Yibai was wounded in the joints of both legs by the troops of the warlord Sun Chuanfang when he participated in the Northern Expedition in Jiangxi in 1926. Later, when he was engaged in underground party work under the arduous white terror, he was arrested by the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1931 and lived in the enemy's prison for a long time, thus leaving him with the disability of not being able to bend his legs for many years. This time, Comrade Zhang Yibai not only ignored the repeated dissuasion of others, but insisted on coming to the construction site and insisted on walking to work on crutches, working as hard as everyone else in the labor. Jin Ming suffered from pleurisy in his childhood and was not able to receive good treatment. Later, many years of arduous revolutionary life damaged his health, so now half of his lung has atrophied, and his left chest is obviously sunken. It was he who not only always held one of the highest cart-pushing records in the entire team, but also when many people needed someone to help pull the cart, he pushed it alone and ran back and forth quickly. Many younger bureau chiefs and division chiefs have repeatedly said to me: "In front of these heroes, what does it matter if we work a little more!"

I stared for a long time at the Premier and many long-tested leading comrades, at their approachable and infinitely radiant images in labor, and could not calm my excited mood for a long, long time.

The Hero of Old Age

Many elderly people also showed the heroic spirit of "old age is strong," and they seemed younger in their common labor and life. Chen Qiyuan, the 72-year-old vice minister, is the oldest member of the team. He is not only full of energy, but also almost doubled his appetite after two days. Shi Liang, nearly 60 years old, would pick up a few small stones and then send a large one to others. People praised her for "knowing how to hold watermelons and pick sesame seeds." Vice Minister Pan Zhenya and Vice Director Zhuang Xiquan are the same age and are both over seventy this year. I often found them pouting and sulking on the construction site, because others always "interfered" with them and persuaded them to rest. Vice Minister Ye Shengtao, Vice Minister Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Director Hu Yuzhi and others, although they are also nearly 60 or over 60, have shown full of energy and perseverance. Li Dequan has always been known as "old age but not old mind," and on the first day she arrived at the construction site, she loudly urged everyone to pay attention to their health, and issued three "prohibitions" against overwork, but she herself was tireless and became more and more happy. Meng Xianmin of the Ministry of Geology heard others say he was old, and he said angrily: "What, do you dislike my beard?" The next day, he had shaved his face clean and was even more radiant.

There is a poem on the construction site praising the elders, which vividly embodies the entire spirit of this collective labor of leading cadres: "The construction site is full of tales of Huang Zhong, his cart is loaded with stubborn stones and his spirit soars, his face is youthful and his hair is white but his body is still healthy, and countless heroes are at his command."

Drawing "Nourishment" from Labor

The more I paid attention to observing, the more I was moved by the spirit of the leading comrades treating labor with the attitude of genuine ordinary laborers. Although they could not spare more time because they were too busy with work, they still seriously did not miss any details in the labor even in a short week, and drew rich leadership ideas and improved leadership style from the labor. In the first two days of arriving at the construction site, people were originally lined up in three long lines, passing stones by hand. Later, the transportation line was lengthened, and the physical strength of each person was uneven, which reduced the efficiency of individual transmission. The amount of stone completed on the third day dropped from more than 130 cubic meters on the second day to more than 90 cubic meters. At this time, many people immediately proposed implementing cart-ization, and immediately piloted it in two brigades, and then widely promoted it after success. Many people also wrote big-character posters, pointing out that this was "two methods, two effects," saying that they "deeply realized from their own labor experience that in leading production in the future, they must always pay attention to adjusting labor organization and vigorously promoting technological innovation." I also saw a big-character poster written by a leading comrade under the name "Peasant" on the construction site. He used "doggerel" to summarize the experience of pushing carts: "Hold the cart shaft straight, legs should be straight and waist should not be bent, be careful not to tip over to one side when walking, two lines of struggle, correctness depends entirely on good control, swaying left and right is not right, all the heroes are statesmen, be good at resolving contradictions and seeking balance." I think, if one were not wholeheartedly devoted to one's labor, who could summarize the experience of pushing carts so specifically, and glean one's understanding from such a high ideological and principled level?

When eating dinner, everyone grabbed a few pieces of pickled vegetables and a head of garlic on the construction site and ate dry food with relish. This is also the most active time for Rong Gaotang, the "director of the construction site club." While people were chewing on sweet and delicious pieces of cake, they could enjoy his poetry recitation, Beijing ballad drumming, and Shaanxi folk songs. One day, Minister Shi Liang also imitated chicken calls, cat calls, and dog calls in front of more than 300 people. Some people who were familiar with her in her early years heard her wonderful ventriloquism for the first time! Wang Zhen, who led the great production movement in Nanniwan, Shaanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, is not only still a labor expert, but also his story of satirizing Confucius for committing doctrinism made everyone laugh. During the rest period every morning, people sometimes hold a small meeting, sometimes wash their sweat-soaked clothes in small groups. Some people were inspired to write big-character posters in various forms such as folk songs, new poems, and ancient poems to express their feelings and emotional changes in common labor and common life. Comrade Lian Guan wrote a long poem of 104 lines in one breath. In this intimate atmosphere, many old people have become much younger.

Labor, Ideology, and Health Achieve a Triple Harvest

"Eating, living, and laboring together" not only profoundly changes the relationship between people, but also profoundly changes the thinking of many people. Some people say that this is a "double harvest of labor and ideology," and some people say that "labor cures all diseases" should also be added, and everyone's health has improved, so it is a "triple harvest of labor, ideology, and health." Everyone said that they received labor education at "Thirteen Tombs University" this time, and they felt very honored, and they all called each other "classmates" when they parted. Comrade Ma Xiwu, nearly 60 years old, wrote a big-character poster, saying that people who have not been tempered by labor should transform their thinking in labor, and even those who have been tempered by war and labor should "return to the furnace" after a long time to avoid "rusting their bodies and minds." Many people proposed to institutionalize this collective labor system, organizing it several times a year to further promote the Party's glorious traditions today. One day, Lu Ming, a director of the Foreign Cultural Commission, quietly pulled me to a resting shed on the construction site. His attitude was serious and earnest, but he could not restrain his excited feelings. He said to me: "The most profound impression that a week of eating, living, and laboring together has given me is that many of our leading comrades originally came from the working people, or even if they did not come from working families, they established flesh-and-blood ties with the working people in the long revolutionary struggle. As long as the Party's glorious traditions are earnestly carried forward, you can see that in today's labor, which is completely out of high consciousness, you can see how perfectly they show the ordinary and noble qualities of laborers!" After hearing his words, I turned back to stare at the labor team composed of leading comrades, and I was both excited and uneasy. How can I understand the feelings of the working people that are bred in their hearts, and express them appropriately? !

"Please check through the five thousand years of history, where have you seen a minister and a vice minister laboring together?" This is a line written by Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Textile Industry. Indeed, regardless of ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, who has ever seen such a team of "ordinary laborers"? Those who falsely claim that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a new totalitarian state, those who falsely claim that the socialist system will inevitably produce bureaucracy, they dare not raise their heads and face this team squarely!

    他们是普通劳动者
    ——中央国家机关和中共中央直属机关领导干部十三陵水库工地集体劳动散记
    本报记者　袁木
    烈日当空，热风炙人，脚下的砂粒都被晒得发烫。周恩来同志领先打着一杆鲜艳的红旗，一支由中央国家机关和中共中央直属机关领导干部组成的劳动队伍，这时正在迎着十三陵水库的拦洪大坝，向着他们的劳动现场进发。
    这是一面标志着崇高的共产主义风格的红旗。一个多星期以来，五百多位领导同志完全以普通劳动者的姿态，在这里紧张地劳动，流下了他们的汗水。
    每天下午三时，银笛一响，人们立刻从比比相连的地铺上一跃而起，列队出发。不论总理、部长、副部长、司局长以至工地技术员、卫生员或行政管理人员，大家一起徒步八里去上工，一路上谈笑风生。直到夜间十一时，人们才背着水库大坝上的万盏灯火，回到驻地。有时，这支队伍在路上同青年水库建设者们迎面相遇，调皮的年轻人就故意高声地挑起战来：“黄忠队，唱一个吧！”“老头儿”们也不示弱，老远地看到年轻人就争取主动：“小伙子们，来一个！”在这互相挑战的热情的呼唤声和欢笑声中，愉快的歌声就在热风中荡漾起来。
    这里没有首长
    第一天，水库指挥部沙西工段政治委员白寿康同志被请来向大家分配任务，指示工作。他刚刚说出“我们欢迎首长们……”的第一句话，周恩来同志立刻纠正他说：“这里没有首长，没有总理、部长、司局长的职务。在这里大家都是普通劳动者。”王震同志紧接着对白寿康同志补充说：“现在你是首长，我们是你的部下。”
    要想如实地表达出工地上愉快欢乐的沸腾气氛，表达出我们敬爱的领导同志们热爱劳动的感情和他们的干劲，那是一件十分困难的事情。炎热的太阳晒得石头烫手，人们不但不加理会，反而快乐地把大石头称做“西瓜”，把小石头称做“香瓜”，一面有节奏地高喊着这样的呼号：“嘿！来了一个大西瓜！”“又来一个小西瓜！”一面飞快把石块运向料堆。几十辆独轮车装着石块在工地上轻捷地转动，人们担起石筐健步如飞，这支平均年龄在四十五岁以上的劳动队伍，几乎个个都想在劳动中赛一赛干劲。
    周恩来同志在大家的集体劳动还没有开始时，就一个人推起一辆小车练习起来。我们敬爱的总理在过去的革命战争中骑马摔坏了右臂，至今他这支胳臂还不能完全伸直，虽然人们一再劝阻，他在干了装料、拉车等活儿以后，还是坚持推了几车石料，要学一学这种劳动。罗瑞卿同志再三告诉大家要注意安全，干起活来要量力而行，稳步前进，而他自己一到工地就忘记了自己对别人的告诫，越干越猛。第一、二两大队的队长、陈国栋同志和余光生同志身体健壮，穿着短裤，脚登球鞋，是工地上的“少壮派”，他们不仅指挥得好，并且带头劳动得好。中央国家机关党委书记龚子荣同志在这里担任着支队政治委员的职务，他同连贯同志是工地上出名的一对“矮胖子”，他们俩人一直坚持抬石筐，始终不懈，人们都称赞他俩坚持劳动的毅力。李葆华同志被石头砸破了手，流了血，但他坚持轻伤不下火线，包扎一下以后，干得越发起劲。
    永不忘怀的形象
    有几个在工地上使人们永远不能忘怀的形象是：早年就失去了一支胳臂的王兴让同志，他一会儿用一只手提着几十斤重的石筐，同别人一起装车卸料，一刻不停；一会儿担起一副石筐，又快又稳；一会儿又帮助别人拉车，一往直前。汗水湿透了他的衣衫，他一面劳动还一面同别人大声谈笑，或者低声哼起歌曲。平凡的劳动给这位不知疲倦的人带来了多大的乐趣啊！工地上大家都尊敬地称他是“独臂英雄”。章夷白同志1926年在江西参加北伐战争时，被军阀孙传芳的部队打伤了两腿的关节，后来他在艰苦的白色恐怖下从事党的地下工作时，又曾在1931年被国民党反动派逮捕，长期生活在敌人的监狱里，因而多年来留下了双腿不能弯曲的残疾。章夷白同志这次不仅不顾别人的多次劝阻，一定要来工地，并且拄着一根拐棍坚持徒步上工，在劳动中和大家一样干得起劲。金明同志幼年得过肋膜炎症，没有能很好医治，后来，许多年革命的艰苦生活又损害了他的健康，因而他现在半边肺已经萎缩，左边的胸脯显然地塌陷下去。就是他，却不仅始终是全队保持推车最高纪录中的一个，并且当不少人推车还需要一个人帮着拉时，他却一个人推着往来快跑。有不少比较年轻的司局长同志曾经一再地对我说：“在这些英雄们的面前，我们多劳动一些又算得了甚么呢！”
    我久久地凝视着总理和许多久经考验的领导同志，凝视着他们在劳动中那样平易近人而又闪耀着无限光辉的形象，好久好久不能平复自己的激动心情。
    老当益壮的英雄
    许多年老长者也都表现了“老当益壮”的英雄气概，他们在共同的劳动和生活中显得年青了。七十二岁的陈其瑗副部长是全队的长者，他不仅干劲十足，并且两天之后饭量就几乎加了一倍。年近六十的史良部长拣几块小石头以后，就要给别人送一块大的，人们称赞她是“既会抱西瓜，又会拣芝麻”。潘震亚副部长和庄希泉副主任同岁，今年都已过七十。我在工地上时常发现他们天真地堵着嘴在生气，原因就是别人老去“干涉”他们，劝他们休息。叶圣陶副部长、郑振铎副部长、胡愈之副主任等人，虽也已年近六十或者六十开外，他们都表现出始终不懈的十足干劲。李德全部长一向是有名的“人老身心不老”，她在一到工地的头一天就大声疾呼地让大家注意健康，三申“禁令”，不要猛干，而她自己却不知疲劳，越干越欢。地质部的孟宪民同志听说别人说他老，他赌气地说：“怎么，是不是你们嫌我胡子多？”第二天，他已经把脸刮得精光，精神更加焕发。
    工地上有一首颂扬长者的诗，它实际上也生动地体现了这次领导干部集体劳动的整个气概：“工地争传老黄忠，日车顽石气吞虹，童颜鹤发身犹健，无数英雄指顾中”。
    从劳动中吸取“养料”
    我越是留神观察，领导同志们以真正的普通劳动者的态度对待劳动的精神，就越加使我感动。他们虽然因为工作太忙抽不出更多的时间，但即使在短短一星期内，还是那样认真地不放过劳动中的任何细节，并且从劳动中吸取丰富领导思想和改善领导作风的养料。刚来到工地的第一、二两天，人们本来是排成三条长龙，徒手传递石头。后来运输线拉长了，并且各人体力强弱不均，挨个儿传递使效率降低，第三天完成的石方由第二天的一百三十多方降到九十多方。这时，马上就有不少人提出实行车子化的建议，并且立即在两个大队试行，成功后又普遍推广。有不少人还写了大字报，指出这是“两种方法，两种效果”，说是他们“从切身的劳动经验中，深刻地认识到在今后领导生产时，要时时注意调整劳动组织和大力推行技术革新。”我在工地上还曾看到一位署名庄稼汉的领导同志写的大字报，他用“顺口溜”总结了推车的经验：“手把车辕端的正，腿要蹬直腰不弓，走路谨防一边倒，两条路线作斗争，正确全凭掌握好，左右摇摆可不中，众英雄都是治国经纶手，要善化矛盾求平衡。”我想，假如不是全心倾注于自己的劳动，谁能这样具体地总结出推车的经验，又从如此思想原则高度悟出自己的体会呢？
    吃晚饭的时候，大家就在工地上抓起几块咸菜，一头大蒜，津津有味地吃起干粮。这时，也是工地“俱乐部主任”荣高棠同志最活跃的时候。在人们正咀嚼着香甜的大块丝糕时，就可以欣赏到他的诗歌朗诵、京韵大鼓和陕北民歌。史良部长有一天也在三百多人面前学起鸡叫、猫叫和狗叫来，有些早年同她熟悉的人，也还是第一次听到她的绝妙口技呢！抗战时期在陕北南泥湾领导过大生产运动的王震同志，不仅至今还是劳动能手，他讲的讽刺孔夫子犯教条主义的故事，也逗得大家捧腹大笑。每天上午的休息期间，人们有时开个小会，有时三三两两去洗自己那浸满汗渍的衣裳。有的人诗兴大作，就用民歌、新诗和古体诗词等各种形式来写大字报，抒发自己在共同劳动和共同生活中的体会与感情变化。连贯同志一口气就写了一首一百零四行的长诗。在这种亲密无间的生活气氛中，许多老年人都变得年青多了。劳动思想健康三丰收
    “同吃同住同劳动”，不仅深刻改变着人们之间的关系，许多人的思想也在发生着深刻变化。有人说这次是“劳动思想双丰收”，有人说还应加上“劳动医百病”，大家健康都有增进，因此是“劳动思想健康三丰收”。人们都说这次是在“十三陵大学”受了劳动教育，并且认为十分光荣，临别时都互称“同学”。年近六十的马锡五老同志写了一张大字报，他说没有经过劳动锻炼的人应该在劳动中改造思想，就是经过战争和劳动锻炼的人，日子久了也应该“回炉”，以免“身心生锈”。许多人都提出要把这种集体劳动制度化，每年组织几次，使党的光荣传统在今天更加发扬光大。对外文委的一位司长鲁明同志有一天悄悄地把我拉到工地上一个休息用的席棚里。他态度严肃认真，但又抑制不住激动的感情。他对我说：“一星期的同吃同住同劳动给我最深刻的印象是，我们有许多领导同志原来就出身于劳动人民，或者即使不是劳动家庭出身，也在长期的革命斗争中同劳动人民建立了血肉联系。只要党的光荣传统认真发扬起来，你就可以看到，像在今天这样完全出于高度自觉的劳动中，你可以看出他们是多么完美地显示出平凡而又高尚的劳动者本色！”听了他的这番话，我再回过头来凝视那支由领导同志组成的劳动队伍，我是又激动而又不安，我怎么样才能体会到孕育在他们心里的那种劳动人民的感情，而又确当的把它表达出来呢！？
    “凭君查遍高史五千载，那见尚书侍郎同劳动”。这是纺织部副部长陈维稷同志写下的诗句。的确，不论古今中外，有谁见过这样一支“普通劳动者”的队伍？那些胡说无产阶级专政是新的极权国家的人，那些胡说甚么社会主义制度将不可免地产生官僚主义的人，他们决不敢在这支队伍面前抬头正视！
