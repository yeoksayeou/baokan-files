Sanmenxia Night
The Sanmenxia Hydroelectric Project on the Yellow River has entered a peak period of staggered construction involving excavation, pouring, and the construction of cofferdams. Inspired by the Party's General Line, all employees of the Engineering Bureau are working day and night to achieve the goals of flood control one year ahead of schedule, power generation six months ahead of schedule, and river closure in the dry season this winter.

    三门峡之夜
    黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程已经进入开挖、浇筑、修围堰交错施工的高峰。工程局全体职工在党的总路线的鼓舞下，正在夜以继日为提前一年拦洪、提前半年发电和今冬枯水季节截流的目标而奋斗。
