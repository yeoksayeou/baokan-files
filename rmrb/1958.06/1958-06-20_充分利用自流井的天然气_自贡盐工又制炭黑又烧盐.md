By Our Correspondent in Chengdu, June 19th: Workers in the Seventh Work Section of the Zigong City Salt Factory No. 1 have successfully produced carbon black on a gas-fired salt boiling stove.

In order to fully utilize the natural gas from Zigong, on May 4th, Wang Liangsheng, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee, led relevant personnel from the Salt Factory No. 1 to visit the Longchang Gas Mine to learn about carbon black production methods. After returning, it was decided to conduct experiments in the Seventh Work Section of the factory, using "local methods" to produce both carbon black and salt. The workers expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and complete the trial production task. Lacking the mechanized equipment of the Longchang Gas Mine, they used some discarded steel plates, iron pipes, and waste bricks to create a set of makeshift equipment costing 140 yuan. However, some people worried that reducing the gas flame on the stove would make it difficult to control and could lead to explosions. Worker Feng Senbo boldly experimented and successfully ignited the flame safely. On May 14th, the first experiment produced only carbon black and no salt. The workers made improvements, and Wang Liangsheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department, went to the site to provide specific assistance. On the 15th, the second experiment produced carbon black, but the quality was poor. The workers then went to the Longchang Gas Mine twice to "learn from experience." Engineers at the gas mine helped them identify the shortcomings in the trial production, and the workers exchanged production experiences. Technicians also helped with testing. The workers of the Seventh Work Section repeatedly studied and improved the equipment, and finally, on May 27th, they successfully produced carbon black from natural gas and also boiled salt.

The carbon black was tested by the Longchang Gas Mine and found to be basically qualified. The Chongqing Chemical Raw Materials Industrial Company has agreed to purchase the carbon black produced by the factory. At the same time, the quantity and quality of salt production can be guaranteed.

If this experience is promoted in all Zigong gas fields, the annual production of carbon black will be close to the output of the Longchang Gas Mine.

### 充分利用自流井的天然气  自贡盐工又制炭黑又烧盐

    充分利用自流井的天然气
    自贡盐工又制炭黑又烧盐
    本报成都19日电　四川省自贡市制盐一厂七工段工人在瓦斯制盐灶上制成炭黑。
    为了充分利用自流井的天然气，5月4日，市委工业部王联升副部长就率领制盐一厂有关人员到隆昌气矿参观制炭黑方法。回来后，即确定在一厂七工段试验用“土办法”既制炭黑又烧盐。职工们表示要克服一切困难完成试制任务。他们没有隆昌气矿那样的机械化设备，就用一些废旧钢板、铁管和废砖，花一百四十元作一套土设备。但是有人说灶上瓦斯火分小以后不好控制，怕爆炸。工人冯森伯大胆试验，到底平安的把火引燃了。5月14日，第一次试验只产炭黑、不产盐。职工们作了改进，市委工业部王联升副部长又到现场具体帮助。15日第二次试验就制出了炭黑，但质量不好。工人们又先后两次到隆昌气矿“取经”，气矿的工程师帮助他们找试制的缺点，工人们就交流生产经验，技术员又帮助化验。七工段的职工一再研究改进设备，终于在5月27日用天然气制出炭黑，又烧了盐巴。
    这些炭黑经隆昌气矿化验结果，基本上合格。重庆化工原料工业公司已同意收购一厂所产的炭黑。同时，盐的产量质量都能得到保证。
    自贡市所有瓦斯如果都推广这一经验，每年生产的炭黑，将接近于隆昌气矿的产量。
