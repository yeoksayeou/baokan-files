Liberating Thought Knows No Bounds, Eradicating Superstition Has No Bottom
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Meeting Filled with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Eighth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was held in Nanjing from the 9th to the 13th. After listening to the report by Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the meeting held four days of group discussions and plenary speeches. Finally, Jiang Weiqing gave a summary.
    The participants deeply appreciated the correctness of the general line for socialist construction. Everyone believed that since the great leap forward in various tasks since last winter and the bumper harvest of summer crops, thoughts had been initially liberated, but today it seems that this was only a "small liberation." Only after studying the general line this time did they further realize that "liberating thought knows no bounds, and eradicating superstition has no bottom."
    The entire meeting was filled with vigorous revolutionary spirit and the heroic courage to dare to think and dare to act. Party committees of various regions, cities, and counties throughout the province, as well as various provincial departments, put forward new leap forward plans. On the agricultural front, it was proposed to strive for even greater harvests in this year's autumn crops and next year's summer crops. Chu Jiang, First Secretary of the Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee, said: The Suzhou Prefecture originally planned to become an 800-jin prefecture this year and strive to become a 1,000-jin prefecture. Now, many counties, townships, and communes have expressed to the prefectural party committee their determination to strive for a rice yield of 1,500 jin or even 2,000 jin per mu. Dai Xinshi, First Secretary of the Jiangyin County Party Committee, said that their slogan is "Double thousand jin per mu of rice, rank first in the province, and strive for county, township, and commune levels to go to Beijing at the same time." Sun Zhenhua, First Secretary of the Huaiyin Prefectural Party Committee, proposed that in addition to comprehensively catching up with the advanced, each county in the prefecture should strive for surpassing the advanced in the yield of individual crops. Siyang County should win the provincial cotton championship, Suqian County should win the provincial sweet potato championship, Guanyun County should win the provincial soybean championship, and Lianshui County should win the peanut championship. Each county also stipulated that the first secretary would take charge of the leading crops. Xie Kedong, First Secretary of the Nantong Prefectural Party Committee, proposed that Nantong Prefecture should strive to be the province's leading cotton producer this year.
    On the industrial front, many secretaries of regional, municipal, and county party committees proposed to grasp agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, and for the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop local industry. Liang Ruren, Deputy Secretary of the Xuzhou Prefectural Party Committee, said that local industry in Xuzhou Prefecture should establish five networks, namely, an agricultural tool machinery manufacturing and repair network, a local fertilizer network, a cement manufacturing network, a food processing network, and a power network. The agricultural tool repair network has now been basically completed. Chen Xiguang, First Secretary of the Zhenjiang Prefectural Party Committee, said that Zhenjiang Prefecture should not only have factories in every county, township, and commune, but also production teams of agricultural cooperatives should also have industrial smoke rising, from small to large, blooming everywhere. Everyone agreed that local industry should closely serve agricultural production, and first of all, it should serve the large-scale water conservancy projects, fertilizer production, soil improvement, deep plowing, and autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting.
    On the scientific, cultural, and educational fronts, the participants unanimously expressed that they should break conventions, eradicate superstition, mobilize the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, adapt to the needs of the technological revolution, and serve industrial and agricultural production. Each prefecture, city, and county will establish new universities this year and establish scientific research institutes. Many secretaries of regional, municipal, and county party committees are prepared to accept the position of director of scientific research institutes and accept invitations from schools to lecture. Each county plans to vigorously run amateur cultural and technical schools to absorb adult farmers who have reached the standard of literacy graduation to continue learning cultural and scientific knowledge. In the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, all localities plan to organize several major shock actions in the next few months.
    The meeting unanimously agreed that in order to promote the realization of the province's great leap forward plan, it is first necessary to combine rectification and production to carry out a movement to publicize the general line and study the general line. At present, to publicize the general line, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to speak out and debate: Is it necessary to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Can we build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Dare we build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? How can we build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? At the same time, a wave of seriously studying Chairman Mao's works should be launched among all Communist Party members. Second, the fundamental problem of realizing the great leap forward plan lies in vigorously carrying out mass movements, and to vigorously carry out mass movements, we must truly believe in the masses. There are three criteria for believing in the masses: Can we consult with the masses when things happen? Can we appear as ordinary laborers? Can we treat the masses equally and participate in labor? Third, strengthen the unified leadership of the Party Committee. Party organizations at all levels must firmly implement the principle of "politics in command, with production as the center, driving all tasks forward together." Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, all tasks should be properly arranged around the center. As long as the above three points are achieved, there must be a great leap forward this year, and there will be an even greater leap forward next year.

    解放思想没有边　破除迷信没有底
    江苏省委会议充满不断革命精神
    本报讯　中共江苏省委第八次全体会议（扩大）9日到13日在南京举行。会议听取了省委第一书记江渭清所作的关于“八大”二次会议精神的传达报告后，进行了四天的小组讨论和大会发言，最后由江渭清作了总结。
    参加会议的人深深体会到社会主义建设总路线的正确性。大家认为：去冬以来各项工作大跃进，夏熟作物丰收，思想已经初步解放，但今天看来这还是“小解放”，这次学习了总路线，才进一步体会到“解放思想没有边，破除迷信没有底”。
    整个会议洋溢着蓬蓬勃勃的革命朝气，敢想敢作的英雄胆略。全省各地、市、县委和省级各部门提出了新的跃进规划。在农业战线上，提出要力争今年秋熟和明年夏熟更大的丰收。苏州地委第一书记储江发言说：苏州专区原来规划今年成为八百斤专区，力争成为千斤专区。现在不少县、乡、社向地委表示力争稻子亩产一千五百斤甚至二千斤。江阴县委第一书记戴心思说，他们的口号是“水稻亩产双千，名列全省第一，争取县乡社三级同时上北京”。淮阴地委第一书记孙振华提出这个专区各县除了全面赶先进外，力争各单项作物产量超先进，泗阳县要夺取全省棉花冠军、宿迁县要夺取全省山芋冠军、灌云县要夺取全省大豆冠军、涟水县要夺取花生冠军，各县并规定挂帅作物由第一书记挂帅。南通地委第一书记谢克东提出南通专区今年要力争棉花产量全省第一。
    在工业战线上，许多地、市、县委书记都提出要一手抓农业，一手抓工业，全党全民大办地方工业。徐州地委副书记梁如仁说，徐州专区地方工业要建立五个网，即农具机械制造修配网、土化肥网、水泥制造网、食品加工网和动力网。现已基本建成农具修配网。镇江地委第一书记陈西光说，镇江专区不仅要县县、乡乡、社社办工厂，而且农业社的生产队也要冒起工业烟来，由小到大，遍地开花。大家一致认为地方工业要紧密为农业生产服务，首先要为大兴水利、大搞肥料、大搞土壤改良、深翻土地和秋收秋耕秋种服务。
    在科学文教战线上，参加会议的人一致表示要打破常规，破除迷信，发动全党全民大办科学文化教育卫生事业，适应技术革命的需要，为工农业生产服务。各专区、各市和县，今年都要办新的大学，并建立科学研究所。许多地、市、县委书记都准备接受担任科学研究所所长的职务，接受学校的邀请，到学校讲课。各县都计划大办特办业余文化技术学校，吸收达到扫盲毕业标准的成年农民继续学习文化和科学知识。以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，各地都计划在今后几个月内组织几次大的突击行动。
    会议一致认为，要促进全省大跃进规划的实现，首先要结合整风和生产，开展宣传总路线、学习总路线的运动，目前宣传总路线，要发动群众鸣放辩论：要不要多快好省？能不能多快好省？敢不敢多快好省？怎样才能多快好省？同时在全体共产党员中掀起一个认真学习毛主席著作的热潮。第二、实现大跃进规划的根本问题在于大搞群众运动，而大搞群众运动，必须真正相信群众。相信群众的标准有三：能不能遇事和群众商量？能不能以普通劳动者的面貌出现？能不能以平等态度对待群众和参加劳动？第三、加强党委的统一领导，各级党组织要紧紧贯彻“政治挂帅，以生产为中心，带动各项工作一道前进”的原则，在党委的统一领导下，围绕中心，妥善安排各项工作。只要做到上述三点，今年就一定要出现大跃进，明年就会出现更大的跃进。
