Learn and Apply, Stir Up a Technical Revolution
The Experience of Scientific Popularization Work in Lai'an County Begins to Be Promoted

(Our reporter Qin Yuzhen reports) The broad masses of peasants in Lai'an County, Anhui Province, have broken the mysterious concept of science and have created a new situation in which everyone learns science, uses science everywhere, and vigorously carries out the technical revolution. Now, amateur technical schools and technical research groups in various agricultural cooperatives and production teams are combining lectures, joint research, and experimental field cultivation to learn, experiment, and promote science and technology simultaneously.

In order to summarize the experience of carrying out popular science work in rural areas and promote a great leap forward in national popular science work, the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization convened an on-site meeting in Lai'an County from May 29 to June 2. More than 80 representatives from 12 provinces and cities, including Anhui, Shandong, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Sichuan, Hebei, Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin, as well as 14 counties and cities, including Sixian, Lu'an, and Hefei in Anhui Province, attended the meeting. At the meeting, Yao Zhen, Secretary of the Lai'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Lai'an County Association for Science and Technology Popularization, introduced the county's scientific and technological popularization work to the representatives. Peng Qingzhao, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, made a summary.

Under the situation of the great leap forward in production, cadres and masses in Lai'an County urgently felt the need to study science and technology. They put forward the slogan of the whole party running science, everyone learning science, and production using science, and launched a debate on the mysterious concept of science, criticizing the bourgeois ideology of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Immediately afterwards, they boldly absorbed more than 2,500 people with production experience, including peasants, teachers, and students engaged in production in their hometowns, as members, lecturers, and propagandists, ensuring that every township, cooperative, team, and village had popular science workers. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the cooperation of various departments, this huge scientific popularization team carried out a vigorous popular science propaganda campaign. They closely combined it with agricultural production, explained various scientific and technological knowledge based on the local production reality, and ensured that they taught what the farmers did and what the farmers used. In the recent two months, they gave 150,000 lectures, with 3,960,000 listeners. After listening to the lectures, the farmers said, "Ah, so this is science. We have such science here. Not only can we learn it, but we can also use it." They broke the superstition that uneducated people cannot learn science and quickly learned various scientific techniques such as crop selection, seed soaking, seed mixing, pest and disease control, close planting of rice, raising rice and sweet potato seedlings in warm beds, artificial pollination of corn, and pruning and topping of cotton.

Farmers who have learned science and technology not only immediately applied science and technology to production, but also created new inventions in an endless stream. When wheat was affected by stem rust, the masses immediately used scientific methods to control it, and the disease was basically eradicated throughout the county within five days. Shiguang Township alone reduced losses by 800,000 jin. Soaking rice seeds broke the old habit of "don't move forward before the second month of Qingming, and don't move backward after the third month of Qingming," and it was generally advanced by about a month, and more than 80% of rice seeds were selected with salt water or muddy water, so the seedlings grew strong and fat. All 30,000 mu of double-cropping early rice planted in the county adopted close planting of large plants with a spacing of 3.6 inches. The masses in the county all contributed ideas and carried out a tool innovation movement. The whole county realized the use of vehicles within four days, and the efficiency of water conservancy construction alone increased from 3 cubic meters per person per day to 23 cubic meters. Popular science workers also explained common sense of hygiene and scientific methods of feeding livestock to the masses, and used the promotion of scientific knowledge to eliminate superstition.

Through on-site visits and debates, this meeting powerfully dispelled the mysterious concept of science among scientific and technological popularization workers, made scientific and technological popularization workers believe that science is the accumulation of labor experience, and believed in the wisdom and strength of the masses, and realized that they must believe in the masses and follow the mass line in order to do a good job in scientific and technological popularization.

    又学又用  大闹技术革命
    来安县科学普及工作的经验开始推广
    本报讯　记者秦聿震报道：安徽省来安县广大农民群众打破了对科学的神秘观念，出现了人人学科学，处处用科学，大闹技术革命的新局面。现在，各农业社和生产队的业余技术学校和技术研究小组，正用听讲、共同研究和种试验田结合的办法，边学、边试验、边推广科学技术。
    中华全国科学技术普及协会为了总结农村开展科普工作经验，推动全国科普工作大跃进，从5月29日到6月2日在来安县召开了现场会议。参加会议的有安徽、山东、云南、浙江、江苏、辽宁、四川、河北和北京、上海、青岛、天津等十二个省、市，以及安徽省宿县、六安、合肥等十四个县、市的代表共八十多人。会上，中共来安县委书记、来安县科学技术普及协会主席姚震，向代表们介绍了本县开展科学技术普及工作的情况。中华全国科学技术普及协会副秘书长彭庆昭作了总结。
    在生产大跃进的形势下，来安县的干部和群众迫切地感到要研究科学技术。他们提出全党办科学，人人学科学，生产用科学的口号，并对科学神秘观念展开了辩论，批判了脱离群众、脱离实际的资产阶级思想。紧接着，他们大胆地吸收了有生产经验的农民、教师、在乡生产的学生等二千五百多人为会员、讲解员、宣传员，做到乡乡、社社、队队、村村都有科普工作人员。这支庞大的科学普及队伍，在各级党委领导下，在各部门的配合下，开展了轰轰烈烈的科普宣传活动。他们紧密结合农业生产，从当地的生产实际出发，讲解各种科学技术知识，做到了农民做什么讲什么，农民用什么讲什么。在最近二个月来，讲演十五万次，听众达三百九十六万人次。农民们听过讲解后说：“呵，原来这就是科学，像这样的科学，我们这里有，我们不但能学，而且能用它。”他们打破了大老粗不能学科学的迷信，很快学会了各种农作物的选种、浸种、拌种、防治病虫害、水稻密植、水稻和山芋用温床育苗、玉米人工授粉、棉花整枝打杈等科学技术。
    学会了科学技术的农民，不但把科学技术立刻用在生产上，而且新的创造发明层出不穷。当小麦发生秆锈病时，群众立即用科学方法防治，在五天内，全县基本上全部扑灭了。仅施官乡就可减少损失八十万斤。水稻泡种打破了“二月清明不上前，三月清明不退后”的旧习惯，普遍提前了一个月左右，而且有80％以上稻种经过盐水或泥水选种，因此秧苗长的又壮又肥。全县栽的三万多亩双季早稻，全部采用了三六寸大棵密植。全县群众人人献计谋，进行工具革新运动。全县四天内实现了车子化，仅兴修水利的工效，就由每天每人三公方提高到二十三公方。科普工作者还向群众讲解了卫生常识、喂养家畜等科学方法，并用宣传科学知识来破除迷信。
    这次会议经过现场参观和辩论，有力地破除了科学技术普及工作人员对科学的神秘观念，使科学技术普及工作人员相信了科学是劳动经验的积累，相信了群众的智慧和力量，认识到必须相信群众，走群众路线，才能搞好科学技术普及工作。
