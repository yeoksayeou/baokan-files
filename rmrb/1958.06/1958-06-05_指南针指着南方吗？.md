　　Does the Compass Point South?
　　Shigong
    The name "compass" tells us that it points south. However, things are much more complicated than you know. On the map, the southernmost point of the Earth is the South Pole, and the compass should point there. But the compass has its own "South Pole." This "South Pole" is located at approximately 73 degrees south latitude and 156 degrees east longitude. Opposite this is a "North Pole," located at approximately 71 degrees north latitude and 96 degrees west longitude. We call them the geomagnetic South Pole and the geomagnetic North Pole. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic needle intersects the true south at a certain angle, and the south end of the magnetic needle tilts when it is near the geomagnetic South Pole; the north end tilts when it is near the geomagnetic North Pole; and it even stands upright at the geomagnetic poles.
    These changes are very complex and vary from place to place, but there are also patterns to be found: for example, within a certain area, the size of the angle formed by the direction of the magnetic needle and the south, as well as the size of the tilt angle of the magnetic needle, are often fixed.
    However, sometimes special phenomena occur, and it can be clearly seen that the magnetic needle does not point south, and even stands upright as if it were at the geomagnetic poles, indicating that the intensity of the magnetic force has changed dramatically.
    What causes these changes? We can think of the effect of bringing an iron hammer close to a compass: the magnetic needle is attracted to it and changes direction. In the mid-nineteenth century, when shipbuilding technology advanced and the amount of iron used on ships increased, this caused compass errors, leading to shipwrecks. So, if a significant compass anomaly is found somewhere now, is it because there are some minerals underground that are affecting the magnetic needle? According to current understanding, magnetite has a strong magnetism and can have a strong effect on the magnetic needle. Therefore, a huge magnetite deposit was discovered in Kursk, Soviet Union, because the compass malfunctioned.
    Changes that can be clearly reflected by the magnetic needle are generally rare. However, if there is a place that can cause the compass to malfunction significantly, it is truly worthy of attention: perhaps there is a large iron ore deposit underground here.
    Our country has already used the study of changes in underground magnetic force with compasses to find minerals. The expansion of the Daye Iron Mine ore body was found by exploring for mineral deposits using this method, and later this method was used to find new iron ore deposits in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
    However, sometimes there are abnormal changes but no minerals are found. What is the reason for this? Also, the geomagnetic poles are not fixed and their positions often change. Why is this? The most fundamental question is why does the Earth have magnetism? These are still mysteries. These problems will be solved in the near future. The third artificial satellite recently launched by the Soviet Union is equipped with instruments to study this issue, so let us wait for the good news from her.

　　指南针指着南方吗？
　　石工
    指南针这个名称就告诉我们它指着南方。然而，事情远比你所了解的要复杂得多。在地图上，地球南端的顶点是南极，按说，指南针应该指向这里。可是指南针有它自己的“南极”。这个“南极”约在南纬七十三度、东经一百五十六度处。与此相对的还有一个“北极”，约在北纬七十一度、西经九十六度处，我们叫它地磁南极和地磁北极。因此磁针的方向与真正的南方相交成一定的角度，而磁针在靠近地磁南极时南端倾侧；靠近地磁北极时北端倾侧；在地磁极上甚至直立起来。
    以上这些变化非常复杂，各地不尽相同，但也有规律可寻：如在一定地区内，磁针方向与南方相交所成角度的大小，以及磁针倾侧角度的大小，往往也是有一定的。
    但是，有时会发生特殊的现象，磁针可以显著地看出来不指南方，甚至像在地磁极上一样直立起来，表示磁力的强度有了剧烈变化。
    什么原因引起变化呢？我们可以想到将一把铁锤靠近指南针所引起的效果：磁针和它相吸引而转移了方向。十九世纪中，当造船技术进步，船上所用的铁增加时，曾因此引起指南针发生错误，使船舶遇了险。那末现在如果在某处发现了指南针的显著失常，是不是因为地下有某种矿产而影响了磁针呢？据目前了解，磁铁矿的磁性很强，可以对磁针发生强烈的作用。因此在苏联库尔斯克就因为指南针失灵而发现了一个巨大的磁铁矿。
    磁针能明显地反映出的变化，一般是少有的。不过要是有某个地方居然能引起指南针显著地失常，那可是真正值得注意了：说不定这儿地下有个大铁矿。
    我国已经利用指南针对地下磁力的变化的研究来找矿了。大冶铁矿矿体的扩大，就是用这种办法探矿而找到了线索，以后又用这种方法在长江中下游找到了新的铁矿。
    不过，有时候虽然有异常的变化但是也找不到矿，这是什么原因呢？还有，地磁极也不是很固定的，位置常常变更，这又是为什么呢？最根本的问题还是地球为什么会具有磁性？目前这些都还是谜。这些问题不久的将来就能解决。最近苏联发射的第三颗人造卫星中，就装有研究这方面问题的仪器，让我们等待着她传来的好消息吧。
