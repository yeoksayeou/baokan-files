The People's Daily report: Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory, on the basis of a great emancipation of communist ideology, is planting red flags everywhere, shouting loudly for new things, and vigorously carrying out a mass technological revolution movement, resulting in major changes in the factory's production.

By June 12th, the factory's employees had put forward more than 1,280 suggestions for technological innovations, of which more than 70% have been implemented. Products that were originally the best in the country can still maintain the top position nationwide; An'an blue cloth, which was originally second to Shanghai, has surpassed Shanghai; the quality of bleached poplin has exceeded that of Japan. The product cost in May was reduced by 21% compared with last year. The first half of the year is expected to complete 53% of the annual output value plan.

The Textile and Dyeing Factory has a total of more than 1,100 employees, only four technicians, and no engineers. In the technological revolution movement, there are sixteen people with significant creations and inventions. The educational level of these sixteen people is: seven with primary school education, three with junior high school education, and six with secondary vocational school education. Their length of service is: five with one to five years, seven with six to ten years, and four with more than ten years. Their ages are: eight each for those aged twenty-one to twenty-four and those aged twenty-five and above. This fact shows that those who can innovate technology and invent are a group of workers, technicians, and petty intellectuals who have grown up in production practice.

The vigorous development of the technological revolution in the Textile and Dyeing Factory is mainly due to the fact that the factory's leading cadres, after putting politics in command and greatly emancipating their minds, have a high degree of sensitivity to new things, attach importance to the active role of people, and adopt a strong supportive attitude towards the technological innovation suggestions put forward by the masses.

While paying attention to the budding of advanced ideas, the leading cadres of the Textile and Dyeing Factory are also good at grasping the signs of advanced things, whether it is a clue to a technological innovation mentioned in a group meeting, an improved technical problem raised in a big-character poster, advanced technology seen in newspapers and books, or advanced experience introduced by fraternal factories. Even if it is just a little sign or an immature idea, they attach great importance to it and actively give it support. For example, at a meeting at the end of March this year, someone mentioned in passing that Liang Shukai had said a "myth" - he wanted to dye silk without dye. Dyeing things requires color, which has been the case since ancient times. However, Zhang Tianhe, the deputy director of the factory, did not think so. He attached great importance to this idea, thinking, "This is a bold idea and worth trying." So he immediately found Liang Shukai and gave him various experimental conditions, so that this young man's bold idea quickly became a reality.

When new things first show their signs, they realistically and fully affirm them politically and economically, which is a great support and encouragement for the technological innovation activities of the masses. When the workers created the first automated equipment - the automatic control of a triple-effect distilled water distiller - after research, they determined that this was one of the directions of the technological revolution in the printing and dyeing industry, so at a mass meeting, they greatly praised the benefits of "automation." The person who created the "automation" equipment was very excited after hearing this, and immediately put forward new "automation" suggestions, and others also started to do it, and soon twenty-two "automation" items appeared in the factory. Subsequently, the old worker Yuan Ende suggested that the elimination of the stretching machine was successful, and the leadership conducted research and then convened a conference to praise the cancellation of the stretching process. This approach promoted the emancipation of workers' minds.

The leading cadres of the Textile and Dyeing Factory are always full of enthusiasm and fully support the suggestions put forward by employees to innovate technology, and help employees realize them. Their main methods are as follows:

First, take responsibility and let employees experiment boldly. The leadership's expression of taking responsibility is not only when the suggestion for technological innovation is first put forward, but also when major twists and turns occur during the experiment, the leadership is the first to take responsibility, encouraging employees to continue the experiment.

Second, provide convenience and let employees experiment with peace of mind. To realize a technological innovation, especially a major innovation, requires some time, equipment, and manpower. The leaders of the Textile and Dyeing Factory gave them various conveniences. The innovators in the factory all said: "As long as our suggestions are known to the factory, all kinds of support will come! We only have one thing on our minds: how to make the experiment successful."

Third, grasp it personally. One is to grasp ideology. When experimenting with coke burning instead of copper plate burning, the experiment failed many times in a row, and even Liu Enting, the worker who made the suggestion, was discouraged. The factory director who participated in the experiment told all the people participating in the experiment: Experiments are often not smooth sailing. If the experiment fails, lessons can be learned, so that continued experiments can avoid detours. One cannot be discouraged after only a few experiments. Liu Enting continued to experiment and finally succeeded. The other is to grasp collaboration. Some major technological innovations involve various departments within the factory, so strengthening collaboration, especially between auxiliary departments and production departments, and between workers and technicians, is very important. Zhang Yanwen, a young worker in the factory, proposed that caustic soda should not be used for cloth practice, which was successfully researched and tested with the assistance of technicians Wang Yaoting and Wang Shuxi.

The leading cadres of the Textile and Dyeing Factory also used the method of planting red flags and establishing models to promote technological innovation. Yao Guoliang, a worker in the iron workshop of the motor vehicle workshop, saw that workers used files to file the screws on the large shuttle sticks, which was slow and tiring, so he used the method of "double-knife flattening" to make the machine replace manual operation, and the output immediately increased by six and a half times. This is not a remarkable creation, but the leading cadres of the factory believe that it has important significance for the current movement. It represents a new direction for workers to use their brains and improve technology, so they decided to raise it as a banner. Yao Guoliang's deeds were announced in conspicuous places, and the whole factory was a sensation at the time. Many workers realized that Yao Guoliang's technological innovation was the direction that every employee should strive for in the future, and they put forward the slogan "Effort must be added to drilling, and everyone should use their brains." The workers in the electrical workshop ran to the dyeing workshop that day to ask the dyeing workers if there were any problems in production that needed the help of electricians to improve. After returning from the visit, they studied day and night and successively realized more than ten technological innovations, such as eliminating mottled sub-cloth. The workers composed such a ballad to praise technological innovation: "People rely on wisdom and tigers rely on mountains, to ensure quality and quantity in large-scale production. It is easy and fast without effort, and the plan exceeds the quota." In this way, the factory has successively emerged innovations with significant economic value and originality.

The leading cadres of the Textile and Dyeing Factory have a strong sense of revolutionary cause. They are wholeheartedly striving for the upper reaches and are determined to run the factory well. They adopted the method of comparing with similar factories and products on a monthly and quarterly basis to find competition opponents. When they saw that others had a little advanced place, they compared, learned, and caught up. They believe that in this era of great leap forward, even if they are advanced, there will be backward places, and backward units will also have advanced places, just like "sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat." In this way, they always look at the advanced places of others, see their own shortcomings, prevent complacency and conservatism, and the revolutionary drive is getting stronger and stronger.

The factory, based on the spirit of continuous revolution, constantly puts forward new goals and promotes the continuous development of technological revolution. At the beginning of this year, they put forward the slogan: "Effort plus research, thousands of innovations, hard work for twenty days, quality catches up with the state-owned cotton, colored cloth surpasses Shanghai on May 1st, and the daily output reaches 250,000 meters (meters)." After the quality exceeded Shanghai and the daily output of dyed cloth reached 255,000 meters, they put forward the slogan "Dare to think and dare to do, strive for the upper reaches, quality surpasses Changzhou (the first in the country) on July 1st, the annual output value is 80 million, and the cost is reduced by 19%." Recently, the factory summarized the development of the previous stage of technological revolution, raised the banner of technological revolution even higher, put forward long-term goals for carrying out technological revolution, and required that ways be found to increase the strength of the cloth, further shorten the process, automate, and adopt new technologies. Several major innovations such as "wash-resistant slurry", "low-temperature refining" and "loose flat washing" are currently being researched. In order to further improve quality, the factory also put forward nine topics such as "resin sizing", which have all been snatched up by employees. Now new technological innovations are emerging in the factory every day, and the sound of gongs announcing good news is rising one after another, and a high tide of technological revolution is being set off in this factory.

    职工敢想敢干  领导全力支持
    天津织染厂掀起技术革命高潮
    新建议新创造大胆试验大部成功  新产品新技术不断超过国内外先进水平
    本报讯  天津市织染厂在共产主义思想大解放的基础上，到处大插红旗，为新生事物大喊大叫，轰轰烈烈地开展了群众性的技术革命运动，使工厂生产面貌发生重大变化。
    到6月12日为止，这个工厂的职工提出了一千二百八十多项革新技术的建议，其中70％以上已经实现。原来是全国第一流的产品，仍可保持全国的首位；原来次于上海的安安蓝布已经越过上海；漂白府绸的质量已经超过了日本。5月份的产品成本比去年降低了21％。上半年可完成全年产值计划53％。
    织染厂共有职工一千一百多人，只有四个技师，没有一个工程师。在技术革命运动中，有重大创造发明的十六人。这十六个人，在文化程度上是：小学七人，初中三人，中等专业学校六人。他们的工龄是：一到五年的五人，六到十年的七人，十年以上的四人。他们的年龄是：二十一到二十四岁、二十五岁以上的各八人。这一事实说明，能够革新技术，发明创造的就是这样一群在生产实践中成长起来的工人、技术人员、小知识分子。
    织染厂技术革命的蓬勃开展，主要是由于这个厂领导干部在政治挂帅，思想大解放后具有高度的对新鲜事物的敏感，重视人的能动作用，对于群众提出的革新技术建议采取了大力支持的态度。
    织染厂领导干部在重视先进思想的萌芽的同时，也善于抓先进事物的苗头，无论是小组会上谈到的一条革新技术的线索，无论是大字报上提出的改进技术问题，也无论在报纸书刊上看到的先进技术，或者是兄弟工厂介绍的先进经验。那怕是一点点苗头，一个不成熟的想法，他们都十分重视，积极给以支持。如今年3月底的一次碰头会上，有人在发言中顺便提到说梁树楷讲了句“神话”，他想不用染料染丝绸。染东西要用颜色，自古以来就是如此，可是，这个厂的副厂长张田和却不这样看，他十分重视这个想法，认为“这是一个大胆的设想，值得试试”。于是他马上找到梁树楷，给他各种试验条件，使这个青年的大胆设想，很快地成为现实。
    他们在新事物刚一露苗头的时候，就实事求是而又十分充分地从政治上、经济上给以肯定，这对于群众的技术革新活动，是一个很大的支持和鼓舞。当工人创制出第一个自动化设备——三效蒸馏水自动控制的时候，他们经过研究，认定这是印染行业技术革命的方向之一，于是在群众大会上，大大地夸奖了一番“自动化”的好处。创制 “自动化”设备的人听了以后很兴奋，马上又提出新的“自动化”建议，别人也动手搞起来，很快地在全厂出现了二十二项“自动化”。接着，老工人袁恩德建议取消拉宽机成功，领导上又作了研究，于是又召开大会，夸奖取消拉宽工序。这种作法，推动了工人们的思想解放。
    织染厂的领导干部，对于职工提出革新技术的建议，总是满腔热情，全力支持，帮助职工实现。他们的办法主要有以下几种：
    一、担责任，让职工大胆试验。领导上表示担责任，不仅是在技术革新的建议刚提出来的时候，在试验过程中发生了重大波折的时候，领导上也是首先把责任担当下来。鼓励职工继续进行试验。
    二、给方便，让职工安心试验。实现一项技术革新，特别是一项重大的革新，是需要一些时间、设备和人力等等条件的，织染厂的领导上给了他们种种方便。厂里的革新者都这样说：“只要我们的建议被厂里知道了，种种支持就都来了！自己就只剩下一个心思，如何使试验成功。”
    三、亲自抓。一是抓思想。在试验焦炭烧毛代替铜板烧毛的时候，连续试验了多少次都没有成功，连提意见的工人刘恩亭也泄了气。参加试验的厂长就跟所有试验的人讲了：试验往往不是一帆风顺的，试验失败了，可以找到教训，使继续试验少走弯路，不能才试验几次就泄气。刘恩亭接着又试验起来，终于成功了。一是抓协作，有些重大的技术革新，牵涉到厂内的各个部门，因此加强协作、特别是辅助部门与生产部门、工人与技术人员之间的协作非常重要。这个厂青工张彦文提出的练布不用火碱，是在技术员王耀庭、王树熙两个人协助下共同研究试验成功的。
    织染厂的领导干部，还用插红旗，树标兵的办法推动技术革新。机动车间铁工部的工人姚国良，看到工人用锉刀锉大梭棍上的螺丝，又慢又累，他就用“双刀车扁”的办法，使机器代替了人工操作，产量立刻提高了六倍半。这并不是一件了不起的创举，但是这个厂的领导干部认为它对当前的运动有着重要的意义，它代表着工人们开动脑筋、改进技术的新方向，就决定把它当作一面旗帜高高举起。在引人注目的地方公布了姚国良的事迹，当时就轰动了全厂。不少工人体会到姚国良革新技术是每个职工今后努力的方向，他们提出了“干劲必须加钻劲，人人都来动脑筋”的口号。电工部的工人们当天就跑到染色车间去问染布工人生产上有没有需要电工帮助改进的问题，访问回来以后，他们就日夜研究，陆续实现了消灭磨白次布等十多项技术革新。工人们编了这样的歌谣歌颂技术革新：“人凭智慧虎凭山，保质保量大生产，不费力气轻又快，计划超额往上翻。”厂里就这样接二连三的出现了具有重大经济价值和富有独创性的革新。
    织染厂的领导干部具有强烈的革命事业心，他们一心一意，力争上游，决心要把工厂办好。他们采取按月按季和同类型工厂和产品进行比较的办法，寻找竞赛的对手，看到别人有一点先进的地方，就比，就学，就赶。他们认为在这个大跃进的时代，自己再先进也会有落后的地方，落后的单位也会有先进的地方，恰如“逆水行舟，不进则退。”这样，他们总是看着别人先进的地方，看到自己不够的地方，防止了自满和保守，革命的干劲越来越足。
    这个厂根据不断革命的精神，不断提出新的奋斗目标，推动技术革命不断向前发展。今年初，他们提出，干劲加钻研，革新千千万，苦战二十天，质量赶国棉，色布“五一”越上海，产量日产廿五万（公尺）的口号。在质量超过上海，染布日产量达到二十五万五千公尺以后，他们又提出“敢想敢干争上游，质量‘七一’越常州（全国第一），产值全年八千万，成本降低19％”的口号。最近，这个厂总结了前一段技术革命开展的情况，更高地举起了技术革命的大旗，提出了开展技术革命的长远目标，要求设法增加布的强力，进一步缩短工序、自动化和采用新技术，目前已有“耐洗浆料”、“低温精炼”、“松式平洗”等几项重大革新正在进行研究。为了进一步提高质量，这个厂还提出了“树脂上浆”等九个课题，已全部被职工抢去，现在这个厂每天都有新的技术革新出现，报捷的锣鼓声此起彼伏，一个技术革命的高潮正在这个工厂中掀起。
