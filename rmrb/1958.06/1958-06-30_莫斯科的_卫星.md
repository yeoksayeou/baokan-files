    Moscow's "Satellite"

    The Moscow satellite we are talking about here is not a satellite in the sky, but a small city that will soon be built near Moscow.

    The "satellite city" is designed according to the instructions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on using the method of building small cities near large cities to disperse the population of large cities. The city is planned to be built near the Kryukovo station, 35 kilometers from Moscow.

    In many countries, small cities near large cities are only used as residential areas, and people still have to go to large cities to work. However, the Soviet "satellite city" is different. It has both residences and factories. Some factories in Moscow will be moved here, so that the working people can save time commuting to and from work, and avoid the fatigue of traveling back and forth.

    The surveying work of the satellite city has now begun (see the picture below), and construction will begin in 1959. This small city will cover an area of 600 hectares and can accommodate 65,000 residents. The residences here will be four-story buildings, with a garden for planting flowers, plants and fruit trees next to each residence. For the convenience of residents, public utility buildings such as schools, kindergartens, shops, theaters, and hospitals will be planned and located near the residences. The "satellite city" also has sports fields, boarding schools, and nursing homes. In addition, a beautiful cultural rest park will be built utilizing the large forests and rivers here.

    This future small city, Moscow's first satellite, does not yet have a name, but people naturally call it "satellite" when talking about it.

### 莫斯科的“卫星”

    莫斯科的“卫星”
    这里说的莫斯科的卫星，不是天上的卫星，而是即将在莫斯科近郊兴建的一座小城市。
    “卫星城”是根据苏联共产党关于利用在大城市近旁建设小城市的办法把大城市人口疏散开的指示而设计的。这个城计划建在离莫斯科三十五公里的克留科沃车站附近。
    在许多国家中，大城市附近的小城只是当作住宅区，人们工作还要跑到大城市里去，苏联的“卫星城”则不同，这里既有住宅，也有工厂，莫斯科市内的一些工厂将迁到这里来，这样，劳动人民可以节省上下班的时间，又可以免去往返途中的劳累。
    现在卫星城的测量工作已经开始了（见下图），1959年即将动工兴建。这个小城将占地六百公顷，可容居民六万五千人。这里的住宅将是四层楼的，每一幢住宅旁边都有一块栽植花草果树的园地。为了居民的方便，学校、幼儿园、商店、剧院、医院等公共事业建筑物，将有计划地分设在住宅近旁。“卫星城”里也有运动场、寄宿学校、养老院，此外还要利用这里的大片森林和河流修建一个美丽的文化休息公园。
    这个未来的小城市，莫斯科的第一颗卫星，现在还没有名字，不过人们在谈论它的时候很自然地都管它叫“卫星”。
