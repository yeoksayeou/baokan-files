Promote the Great Leap Forward in Work Related to Providing Preferential Treatment to Servicemen and Veterans and Social Relief
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Wang Ziyi
The main tasks of the civil affairs departments are preferential treatment, demobilization, disaster relief, and social relief. Apart from disaster relief work, in terms of preferential treatment, demobilization, and social relief work, there are 21.52 million family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of soldiers, and disabled soldiers nationwide, 5.58 million demobilized soldiers, and 8.7 million people receiving social relief, totaling 35.8 million people. The work of providing preferential treatment and relief to these people is a regular task. Among these people, very few are completely incapable of working, about one million, who are provided with material guarantees by the state and cooperatives respectively. The vast majority are capable of working or still have some ability to work. There are two central links to doing a good job with these people: one is how to give full play to the role of demobilized soldiers in the socialist construction, and the other is how to help people with difficult lives solve their problems and create conditions for them to participate in socialist construction. By organizing production, we can develop social security undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Among the family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and socially disadvantaged households, about 13 million people have difficult lives but have some ability to work. Relying on relief alone can only maintain their lives. They are not content with sitting idle and receiving relief. They demand to participate in socialist construction and want to change from poverty to prosperity. How to solve this problem? In the work of providing preferential treatment and relief in both urban and rural areas, there have been two opposing viewpoints for several years: one is pure relief by the state or collective, and the other is solving the problem through organizing production.

In the early days of liberation, the gates of urban civil affairs departments were often lined with queues of people asking for relief. Relief was given every day, and it was always the same. It was difficult to completely solve their problems by relying on pure relief. In 1952, some cities began to organize them to engage in handicrafts or small-scale industrial production. All those who participated in production fundamentally solved their livelihood problems. Therefore, the Second National Civil Affairs Conference in 1953 affirmed this approach in terms of policy. By 1954, this welfare production of a social security nature had developed in all cities and towns across the country, with 3,300 production units and 470,000 people participating in production. However, during the upsurge of the Three Great Transformations at the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956, some of our comrades, after hearing the announcement that our cities had entered socialist society, believed that there would not be much relief work in the future. Even if there were still some households in difficulty, they could just issue relief funds. They believed that civil affairs departments no longer needed to organize social welfare production. At this time, some people advocated stopping organizing production and trying to hand over the already organized production units separately.

Such a small trend pushed out more than a thousand formed factories and cooperatives without distinguishing the circumstances. Some of them were composed entirely of able-bodied labor, which should have been handed over, but there were also a number that should not have been pushed out. More importantly, this approach affected the cessation of social welfare production development in many cities and towns. Subsequently, relief recipients came to the door asking for relief, and the work fell into a passive state. After some production units were handed over, because those disabled, elderly, and semi-able-bodied workers did not meet the economic accounting and staffing quota regulations of regular enterprises, the relevant departments returned them as they were, or dismissed some of the disabled, elderly, and semi-able-bodied workers, forcing these people to return to the old path of sitting idle and receiving relief. Although this twist caused some losses to this work, it gave us beneficial lessons. It helped us to further affirm the policy put forward by the Second National Civil Affairs Conference. Most comrades acknowledged that organizing social welfare production was a correct way to solve the problems of preferential treatment and relief in urban areas. Therefore, from the second half of 1956, especially in 1957, this production undertaking was further developed. By the end of 1957, the number of production units had increased to more than 8,000, and the number of people participating in production reached 580,000.

After the rectification campaign, especially after the Party put forward the great call for the whole Party to run industry and the whole people to run industry, the minds of civil affairs cadres were liberated, and the enthusiasm of people enjoying preferential treatment and relief to participate in socialist construction was unprecedentedly high. This situation led to another leap forward in this production undertaking. This upsurge of organizing production has spread from large and medium-sized cities to all cities and towns. Everywhere, people are taking action at all levels, and flowers are blooming everywhere. Rural areas have also begun to organize this kind of welfare production. Many cities, after half a month of hard work, organized all the recipients of preferential allowances and social relief into production. Many cities, such as Dalian, Qingdao, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Xuzhou, Nanchang, Shashi, Huangshi, Yichang, Anyang, and Hohhot, have achieved full self-sufficiency in preferential allowances and social relief funds through organizing production, and no longer receive these two funds from the state. Some cities, such as Shenyang, Dalian, and Fushun, have also used production income to establish new social welfare undertakings such as nursing homes and mental sanatoriums. The Party and government leaders in various places have strongly supported this development, and the masses with difficult lives have cheered, "Every household is busy with production, and no household has idle people." This has played a huge role in promoting the transformation of consumer population into production population and the transformation of consumer cities into production cities. Organizing production is the best way to turn uselessness into usefulness and poverty into prosperity.

Organizing social security-oriented welfare production is the best form of implementing the Party and the state's policy of "overall planning and appropriate arrangement" for the elderly, weak, and disabled people with only some ability to work. It is the fundamental way for these people to go from poverty to prosperity. This path has gradually formed and gradually become clear.

Some people once thought that these disabled, elderly, and semi-able-bodied workers could not solve much problem through production. The facts have given a positive answer. They were useless people in the old society, but they have become useful people in the new society. They are useless people in a scattered state, but once they are organized, they become useful people and become an extraordinary production force. Before participating in production, they could only receive four or five yuan of relief or subsidies from the state every month. Although they had a certain guarantee in life, it was only to maintain a low standard of living. After participating in production, they could receive fifteen yuan, thirty yuan, or even forty or fifty yuan of wages every month, changing from poverty to prosperity. For example, the Shenyang Waste Recycling Plant picks up waste from garbage dumps for processing and production. More than 90 people participating in production are all disabled and elderly people who used to receive relief. Now their lowest monthly wage is 15 yuan, and the highest is more than 60 yuan, with an average of 39 yuan per person. The Qingdao Blind Rattan Production Group, with 29 people, also used to be relief recipients. Now their lowest monthly wage is 20 yuan, and the highest is 45 yuan, with an average of about 30 yuan. Seven people have gotten married, and in their spare time, some sing, some learn Braille, and they live a happy and joyful life. The wages paid by general urban production units are many times higher than the urban preferential treatment and relief expenses. In 1957, the production units in Zhangjiakou City paid a total of 1.43 million yuan in wages, which is 22.4 times the city's annual preferential treatment and relief expenses. That is to say, if production is not organized and only relief is given, to guarantee these people's lives to the current level, it would be necessary to increase the urban preferential treatment and relief budget by several times or even dozens of times. Therefore, urban residents with difficult lives say, "Relief is limited, production is infinite." They are extremely supportive of organizing social welfare production and are very grateful to the Party. Many people in cities who originally received relief have become activists in various street work after participating in production, and a group of new technical personnel and enterprise management personnel have emerged.

Some people also believe that China has plenty of labor, and organizing these people to participate in production is insignificant. This is certainly not right. In the past, China felt that there was a lot of labor because production was not fully developed. Once production and construction leap forward, it feels insufficient. Organizing these people to participate in production can allow some strong laborers to be drawn from some less labor-intensive positions and used in production and construction positions that need them more, so that "everyone can use their talents." At the same time, organizing these semi-able-bodied workers to engage in auxiliary production for industrial and mining enterprises and to produce daily necessities for the masses can supplement the shortcomings of large-scale industrial production and create wealth for society. Wenzhou City organized a total of 187 production units, with 13,812 people participating in production. Only 22 of the large production units had a total output value of 9.22 million yuan in 1957, accounting for 64% of the city's total local state-owned industrial output value. There are also 32 kinds of products that are exported to the Soviet Union, East Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The Nanjing Social Welfare Steel Galvanizing Plant successfully trial-produced 13 kinds of products that are indispensable for industry during the Great Leap Forward, such as fan ears, Klasses, ten-character joints, steel caps, steel bowls, joints, plum drills, wood screw drills, special bright screws, water pipes, connections, elbows, and tees. Among them, the plum drill has exceeded the Japanese level and caught up with the British level, and the wood screw drill has exceeded the British level and is close to the American level, while these two products used to rely on imports. Vice Mayor Jia of Nanjing City said: "You are really not simple. I thought you were just self-help production units. I never expected that you could manufacture such advanced products with handicrafts."

Social security-oriented welfare production can be organized in both urban and rural areas.

Can rural areas organize this kind of social security-oriented welfare production? Some rural areas are already doing this. In Jianping County, Liaoning Province, all 38 townships and one town have established 98 welfare production units, one of which is county-run, and the others are commune-, township-, and town-run. These units mainly serve agricultural production, are small and diverse, use local materials, require little investment, yield great returns, and accommodate many people. They mainly rely on everyone's efforts and provide necessary support with preferential treatment and relief funds. After they are established, most people with difficult lives can quickly achieve self-sufficiency in production. The county has already put forward the slogan "Self-sufficiency in production in 1958, no need for state relief in 1959." The county Party committee of Ji County, Hebei Province, decided that this social welfare production should achieve "every township has a factory, and every commune has a workshop." Most counties in Anhui Province have generally implemented the method of organizing the "Five Guarantees" households (childless and infirm old persons who are guaranteed food, clothing, fuel, medical care, and burial expenses by the people's commune) to engage in collective production. For example, the Liyu Commune in Wuhu County organized 30 "Five Guarantees" households who still had some ability to work and could be concentrated to engage in collective production. In 1956, after returning the investment of the agricultural cooperative, each person's average income was 66.7 yuan. In 1957, each person's average income was 75 yuan, exceeding the living standard of ordinary commune members, and there was also public accumulation. This year, they plan to grow vegetables, melons, lotus roots, water chestnuts, raise chickens, raise rabbits, raise silkworms, and paste matchboxes, etc., and it is estimated that they can earn 5,500 yuan. In addition to promoting their experience of centralized production throughout the county, the county Party committee also named this production team the "Happy Elderly Team."

We originally thought that it would be difficult to organize social welfare production in rural areas, but the facts prove that it can be organized. The disabled, elderly, and semi-able-bodied workers with difficult lives cannot solve their problems by relying on participating in agricultural production with high labor intensity, in addition to the regular rural sideline production. Light agricultural work is not frequent, and the income is very low. Now, with the whole people running industry and every township and commune running industry, there are broad avenues for rural areas to organize social welfare production.

Does it cost a lot of money? No. Urban areas have organized production to such a large scale, and generally no money has been allocated specifically. Their production funds are solved in three ways: first, starting a business with diligence and frugality, starting from scratch, gradually accumulating, and growing from small to large; second, borrowing from banks and repaying regularly; third, using part of the preferential treatment and relief funds as production investment. Most of the production units that have been organized in various places started from scratch. Such production units account for more than 90% of all production units. For example, the Glorious Flax Knife Factory in Bengbu City started with a kitchen knife and a wooden pier, and has now developed into a factory with more than 240 workers, 140,000 yuan in capital, and an annual output of 3 million kilograms of flax knives, equipped with electric machinery. Shenyang City recently organized 2,730 people in one and a half months, and the 39 welfare production units that were built did not cost the government a penny. The Martyrs' and Soldiers' Family Service Agency in Wangqing County, Jilin Province, was established in 1951 by five disabled soldiers with 45 yuan of disability money. They used this money to buy four hens and 1,007 eggs. After raising the hatched chicks, they sold them to buy machines. By the end of 1957, it had developed into 13 production units, including cotton ginning, sewing, food, and iron factories, with 130,000 yuan in capital, absorbing 407 poor families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, etc. to participate in production. It not only fundamentally solved the livelihood problems of the people participating in production, but also bought and built a number of houses, named "Glory Street," and provided them free of charge to the families of martyrs and soldiers without houses in the whole town, and also provided 14 orphans of martyrs to go to school, with a total expenditure of more than 8,000 yuan for orphan education and upbringing over the years. All of the above examples fully illustrate that as long as the masses are mobilized and relied on, they will be able to come up with various methods.

Now the slogans in various cities and towns are "Achieve full self-sufficiency in preferential allowances and social relief funds through production within one year." Although the conditions in rural areas are a little worse, it is also possible to achieve self-sufficiency in production within two years by doing so. This shows that it is wrong to think that social welfare undertakings cannot be done without money, and cannot be done well with little money. As social welfare production develops, the wealth created can not only fundamentally solve the livelihood problems of the people participating in production, but also make it entirely possible to provide the state and collectives with a large amount of expenditure for carrying out other social welfare undertakings. In this way, a new situation will emerge in social welfare undertakings: the lives of the people being served will go from poverty to prosperity, the burden on the collective will be reduced, and the state's expenditure will be reduced. This will actually reflect the principles pointed out in Comrade Shaoqi's report on solving welfare problems: "Reasonably balance the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," "Be conducive to consolidating and developing socialist ownership," and "Be conducive to the development of social production."

The number of preferential treatment, relief recipients, and blind and deaf-mute people who have been organized and will be organized this year in urban areas will reach about 1.3 million. Rural social welfare production will also be greatly developed. In the future, we plan to gradually organize the old, weak, and disabled workers in enterprises who do not meet the retirement conditions and cannot engage in general factory production into this kind of welfare production to solve their livelihood problems through production, so as to reduce the burden on enterprises. We can also gradually organize family members of cadres and workers in organs and enterprises who have labor but have difficult lives.

The social welfare production undertaking has actually formed a part of the local economy and must be included in the local overall economic plan, unifiedly arranged under the leadership of the Party, and closely cooperated with relevant departments. Many places have done this in the past, and must do so in the future.

Organizing social security-oriented welfare production is not a temporary expedient, especially organizing disabled people and blind and deaf-mute people to carry out production, which is a long-term welfare undertaking, because there are many causes of disability, and it is impossible to completely avoid them. When organizing these people to carry out production, it must be carried out under the principle of not affecting their health. At the same time, scientific and technological research work should also be strengthened, and efforts should be made to use scientific and technological achievements to provide them with better conditions for participating in production. This requires:

First, establishing research work on medical labor appraisal, that is, studying what kind of disability and how much loss of labor ability is suitable for engaging in what kind of production, so as to gradually realize the scientific division of labor in production.

Second, gradually improving the working conditions of disabled people, researching and improving production tools and mechanical equipment suitable for them, from semi-mechanical to realizing mechanization, so as to reduce their labor intensity.

Third, establishing a scientific research institution for the prosthetic limb industry, so that the quality of prosthetic limbs in our country can catch up with the international level in three to five years, so as to assist disabled people in engaging in productive labor.

Fourth, gradually carrying out vocational training for disabled people to help disabled people quickly switch to new production and construction positions after disability.

Better Give Play to the Assault Role of Demobilized Soldiers in Construction

The Party Central Committee has pointed out that "Demobilized soldiers are a valuable active force." In the anti-Rightist struggle and in the grass-roots socialist debate, it has indeed proved their ideological and political reliability. In the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, it has once again proved that they are shock workers in production and construction.

After the Party issued the call for a Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demobilized soldiers were energetic, high-spirited, and rushed to formulate personal leap forward plans and wrote letters expressing their determination. From urban to rural areas, thousands and tens of of thousands of people gathered to hold meetings, and the sounds of challenges and reports of victory resounded everywhere. They issued a common oath: to be the vanguards of the Great Leap Forward. Then, they threw themselves into the high tide of the leap forward in their respective positions with a fighting attitude. The advanced became more advanced, and the backward also caught up. Wu Senfu, a people's hero who twice won special merit in the war, completed 53 days of work in 17 days at the Shanghai Datong Iron Factory. Yi Ergui, from Chengguan Township, Hequ County, Shanxi Province, was not very advanced at first. After participating in the county's mobilization meeting, he served as the leader of the commune's shock team. During the day, he led more than 90 women to cultivate 1,900 zhang of dike, and at night he led 220 shock team members to "Great War Jiu Niang Tan." In seven nights, they built 100 mu of paddy fields, planted 4 mu of reeds, and planted 18,000 trees. He has now been rated as a first-class model shock team leader.

In such a great era, demobilized soldiers are not satisfied with just completing their own production tasks. They demand to "go wherever there are difficulties." Therefore, they have formed 40 Warriors, Hero Companies, Steel Companies, Sharp Knife Companies, Meng Hu Companies, Flying Tiger Teams, etc. The organization of this kind of production shock team appeared everywhere. The demobilized soldiers in Funing County, Hebei Province, dug a 30-li long canal. There was a mountain ridge in the middle. The plan proposed by the county Party committee was to dig through it in seven days, but the sharp knife company formed by the demobilized soldiers dug through it in one day and one night. The Hero Company of demobilized soldiers in Dongling Township, Zunhua County, completed a reservoir and fish pond in six days to realize the "Four Goods in Dongling Township." Then, they accepted the task of expanding the channel. The township planned to complete it in half a month, but they completed it in only six days. Now the production shock team in Zunhua County has strung together 2,760 militiamen through 1,634 demobilized soldiers, forming five hero battalions, 17 hero companies, and 11 hero platoons, undertaking the construction projects of 26 reservoirs, two hero dams, and a "10,000-pig farm." It is like this in rural areas, and it is also like this in factories. More than 500 demobilized soldiers in the Beijing Radio Factory organized 16 shock teams, vanguard teams, and leap forward teams, overfulfilling the leap forward production tasks for the first quarter and ensuring that they will save 10,000 taels of gold for the country throughout the year.

Demobilized soldiers are not only an active force in construction, but also a shock force.

Many people understand the active role of demobilized soldiers in socialist construction, but some people did not understand it, and even seized on individual cases of poorly performing demobilized soldiers to negate the active role of the vast majority of demobilized soldiers. The facts have thoroughly criticized the views of these people. Demobilized soldiers are not only an active force in construction, but also a shock force.

Whether demobilized soldiers can become a shock force depends on whether they are fully trusted, constantly educated, and boldly used. Only in this way will they feel the Party's concern for them and their enthusiasm will become greater and greater; only in this way will they always maintain a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and vigorous fighting spirit.

To educate them, rely on them, and use them, it is necessary to adopt certain forms. Without certain forms, it is not possible to meet their requirements by simply educating them in the same way as the general masses, and it is not enough to give play to their role. Now many places strengthen their education through forms such as demobilized soldiers' study stations, study groups, forums, and representative meetings. Experience has proved that this is a necessary form for them to carry out self-education and for the Party to educate and mobilize them to play an active role in various tasks. The Funing County Party Committee in Hebei proposed to "grasp the demobilized soldiers as if they were grasping Party and League members." Therefore, when carrying out various tasks, in addition to conveying and implementing them among Party and League members, they also convey and implement them among demobilized soldiers and put forward specific action requirements to them. The reason why the demobilized soldiers in Funing County and Zunhua County were able to play a huge role in the Great Leap Forward in production is that the Party committees at the county, district, and township levels attached great importance to the education and use of demobilized soldiers.

Organizing various forms of demobilized soldiers' shock teams in special times of need is suitable for their characteristics, because they all have a high degree of organization and a tenacious spirit of hard work, and our Party often encounters "strong fortresses" on the road of production and construction, which require a large number of shock workers. In peacetime, they should be organized and educated to frequently move among the general masses and play a leading and backbone role. Zunhua and Funing in Hebei adopt a combination of decentralization and centralization for the demobilized soldiers' shock teams. They are usually broken up and integrated to lead the masses in production, and when particularly necessary, they are integrated to complete the most arduous production tasks.

Some places have pointed out that attention should be paid to preventing the tendency of only using demobilized soldiers without educating them, which is right. However, their socialist education must avoid empty preaching. Only by organizing and helping them to participate in actual work and production struggles can they become the backbone force of socialist construction and can the best and most practical political education be carried out on them.

Comrade Shaoqi's report at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the whole country to launch a "technical revolution" and a "cultural revolution." This is the great task of socialist construction for the people of our country in the future.

The political and ideological education of demobilized soldiers should become the central task of resettlement work in the future.

The situation in various places shows that demobilized and retired soldiers are also an active force in the current upsurge of technical and cultural revolutions. Mi Hengfu and Zhang Xueling of the spray painting section of the state-owned Beijing Radio Factory changed the individual dry process division of labor to a cooperative assembly line operation method, increasing production efficiency by more than four times. Mi Boxian of the transportation company's auto repair factory created and improved eight kinds of tools for assembling auto parts, and using these tools, he can complete two and a half years of production tasks in one year. Yang Xian of the Third Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building changed the specific gravity analysis method to a combined specific gravity meter and liquid transfer tube analysis method, shortening the operation time from four hours to ninety minutes. He also led everyone in trial-producing a dual-purpose bottle washing machine, which increased work efficiency by eight times. Wang Peiying, a maintenance worker at the Hangzhou Post and Telecommunications Bureau, improved the operation method and broke the record ten times in a row, shortening the time for repairing a telephone from 250 minutes to 35 minutes. Li Zhengbiao and his comrades in the Nanjing Electronic Tube Factory worked hard for two days and nights to produce "vacuum baked grease" and "vacuum sealing paste." According to a report from Nanjing, the quality has caught up with the United States, and the cost is only one-thirty-fifth of that of the United States, leaving the United Kingdom behind. The electrical repair team in Xuzhou, mainly composed of demobilized soldiers, created a five-in-one radio (radio, recording, broadcasting, playback, and turntable). In Qin Jialiang Village, Louziying Township, Hequ County, Shanxi Province, only one person out of 11 households was literate, and Liu Cunhou, a demobilized soldier, turned this illiterate village into a model literacy village.

The majority of the 5.58 million demobilized soldiers in the country have a certain level of education, including more than 600,000 technical personnel, such as automobile drivers, aircraft pilots, bulldozer and crane drivers, marine engineers, tank drivers, telecommunications personnel, medical personnel, meteorological personnel, radar personnel, designers, surveyors, machinists, fitters, welders, riveters, lathe operators, electricians, and various other technical personnel. Demobilized soldiers not only have drive, but also have a spirit of drilling. Under the encouragement of the Party's call for a "technical revolution" and a "cultural revolution," as long as they are paid attention to and used and cultivated in a planned way, they will certainly be able to become active members of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution.

Political mobilization and ideological education for demobilized soldiers should become the central task of future resettlement work. However, care for the small number of elderly, infirm, and needy people must not be relaxed. Only by doing this well can we better give play to their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction.

    促使优抚复员和社会救济工作的大跃进
    内务部副部长　王子宜
    民政部门的主要业务是优抚、复员、救灾和社会救济工作。除救灾工作以外，在优抚、复员和社会救济工作方面，全国烈属、军属、残废军人有二千一百五十二万人，复员军人有五百五十八万人，社会救济工作对象有八百七十万人，共计三千五百八十万人，对这些人的优待、救济工作，是属于经常性的工作。这些人当中完全没有劳动能力的是很少数，大约有一百余万人，是由国家和合作社分别给予物质保证的。而绝大多数是有劳动能力和尚有一部分劳动能力的，要做好这些人的工作有两个中心环节：一个是如何发挥复员军人在社会主义建设中的突击作用问题，一个是如何帮助生活有困难的人解决困难，为他们创造参加社会主义建设的条件问题。通过组织生产，多快好省地开展社会保障事业
    在烈属、军属、残废军人和社会困难户中大约有一千三百万人是生活有困难但有一部分劳动能力的。这些人依靠救济只能是维持生活，他们不安于坐食救济，要求参加社会主义建设，要求由贫困变富裕。怎样解决这个问题呢？不论在城镇或者在农村的优抚救济工作中，几年来都有两种观点对立着，一种是由国家或集体单纯救济，一种是通过组织生产解决问题。
    在解放初期，城市民政部门的大门口，经常排列着要求救济的队伍，天天救济，天天如此，依靠单纯救济很难彻底解决他们的问题。1952年有些城市开始组织他们搞手工业或小型工业生产，凡是参加生产的人都从根本上解决了生活困难问题，因此1953年第二次全国民政会议从方针上肯定了这种作法。到1954年，这种社会保障性质的福利生产发展到全国所有的城镇，生产单位达到三千三百个，参加生产的达到四十七万人。可是到1955年底和1956年初的三大改造高潮中，我们有些同志在听到宣布我们的城市已进入社会主义社会的声音之后，就认为今后不会有多少救济工作了，即使还有一部分困难户，发发救济款就行了，认为民政部门不需要再组织社会福利生产了，这时就有人主张停止组织生产，并要把已组织起来的生产单位设法分别交出去。
    这样一股小风，将一千多个成型的厂、社不分情况的推出去了。其中有的是全部整劳动力组成的，那是应当交的，但也有一批是不应当推出去的，更重要的是那种做法影响到不少城镇的社会福利生产停止发展了，随之而来的又是救济户上门要求救济，工作陷于被动。有些生产单位交出后，因为那些残老半劳动力，不符合正规企业的经济核算和定员定额的规章制度，有关部门又把它们原封退回来了，有的是把部分残老半劳动力给辞退出来了，使这些人又不得不重新走上坐吃救济的老路。这一个曲折，虽然使这项工作受到一些损失，但是却给了我们以有益的教训。它帮助我们把第二次全国民政会议提出的方针，进一步地肯定下来，大多数同志承认了组织社会福利生产是解决城镇优抚、救济问题的一条正确的道路。因而从1956年下半年起，特别是在1957年，这项生产事业又得到了进一步的发展，到1957年年底生产单位发展到八千多个，参加生产的人达到五十八万。
    整风以后，特别是党提出全党办工业、全民办工业的伟大号召以后，民政干部的思想得到了解放，享受优待救济的人们，要求参加社会主义建设的热情空前高涨，这种形势使这项生产事业又来了一个飞跃的发展。这个组织生产的高潮，已经由大中城市遍及所有城镇，到处是层层动手，遍地开花，农村也开始了举办这种福利生产。许多城市苦战半月，就把优抚补助和社会救济对象全部组织到生产中来，许多城市如旅大、青岛、南京、郑州、张家口、唐山、徐州、南昌、沙市、黄石、宜昌、安阳、呼和浩特等，已经通过组织生产，达到优抚补助费和社会救济费的全部自给，而不再向国家领取这两项费用了；有的城市如沈阳、旅大、抚顺等，并且运用生产收益，举办了养老院、精神病疗养院等新的社会福利事业。对于这一发展，各地的党政领导大力支持，生活困难的群众欢呼雀跃，“家家忙生产，户户无闲人”，这对变消费人口为生产人口、变消费城市为生产城市，起了巨大的促进作用。组织生产是变无用为有用，变贫苦为富裕的最好道路组织社会保障性质的福利生产，是我们党和国家对只有一部分劳动能力的老、弱、残废人们，实行“统筹兼顾，适当安排”方针的一个最好的形式，是使这些人从贫困到富裕的根本道路。这条道路是逐步形成也是逐步明确的。
    曾经有人认为这些残老半劳动力，不能通过生产解决多大问题。事实已经作了肯定的答复。他们在旧社会是无用的人，但在新社会就成了有用的人；他们在分散的状态下是无用的人，一旦被组织起来，就成了有用的人，并且成了一支不平凡的生产大军。他们在参加生产以前每月只能从国家领到四、五元的救济或补助，虽然在生活上得到了一定的保障，也只是维持较低生活而已，参加生产以后，每月就可以拿到十五元、三十元乃至四五十元的工资，变贫苦为富裕。例如，沈阳市废品再生厂，从垃圾堆里拣废品，进行加工生产。参加生产的九十多人，都是过去享受救济的残老人员，现在他们最低的月工资是十五元，最高的是六十多元，平均每人三十九元。青岛市盲人藤器生产组，二十九人过去也都是救济户，现在他们最低的月工资是二十元，最高的是四十五元，平均三十元左右，已有七人结了婚，业余时间有的拉唱，有的学盲文，过着幸福愉快的生活。一般城市生产单位开支的工资，等于城市优抚、救济费的好多倍。张家口市1957年各生产单位共开支工资一百四十三万元，等于张市全年优抚、救济费的二十二点四倍。这就是说，假若不组织生产而单纯救济，要把这些人的生活保障到现在的水平，就需要把城市优抚救济费预算增加几倍以至几十倍。因此，城市生活困难者都说：“救济有限，生产无穷”，对于组织社会福利生产极为拥护，对党非常感激，许多城市原来享受救济的人，参加生产以后，成了街道各项工作中的积极分子，并且出现了一批新型的技术人员和企业管理人员。
    也有人认为我国有的是劳动力，组织这些人参加生产无足轻重。这当然也是不对的。我国劳动力过去感到多，那是生产没有得到充分发展的缘故，生产建设一经跃进，就感到不足了。组织这些人参加生产，可以使一些壮劳动力从一些劳动强度较轻的岗位上抽出去，用到更需要他们的生产建设岗位上去，做到“人尽其才”。同时，组织这些半劳动力从事为工矿企业加工辅助性的生产，从事群众日常生活用品的生产，可以补助大工业生产之不足，又为社会创造了财富。温州市共组织了一百八十七个生产单位，参加生产的有一万三千八百一十二人。仅其中二十二个大型生产单位，1957年的产值即达九百二十二万元，占全市地方国营工业总产值的64％，还有三十二种产品远销苏联、民主德国、英国和日本。南京社会福利钢铁镀锌厂，在大跃进中，试制成功了凡耳、克拉丝、十字节、钢帽、钢碗、接头、梅花钻、木螺丝钻、特光螺丝、自来水管、连结、湾头、三通等十三种工业必不可少的产品，其中梅花钻已超过日本水平，赶上英国水平，木螺丝钻已超过英国水平，接近美国水平，而这两种产品过去都是依靠进口的。南京市贾副市长说：“你们真不简单，我以为你们只是生产自救单位，真想不到你们能用手工业制造出这样高级的产品。”
    还有些人提出这样的问题，为什么不要这些人参加一般工业生产而要组织社会福利生产呢？所以要组织社会福利生产是由于这些人的特点决定的。正规工业生产要求工人具备一定强度的劳动能力，并有一定的年龄限制，在一定的时间内完成一定的生产定额，而这些人都是老弱残疾和有子女牵累的家庭妇女，没有参加一般厂矿生产的条件。据长春、济南、青岛、张家口、徐州等城市的统计，社会福利生产单位内孤老残废和半劳动力占70％—80％。临清市社会福利麻绳生产合作社一百名生产人员中，拐子、聋哑人、盲人、五十岁以上的老人和十八岁以下的流浪儿童占90％。徐州市社会福利席箔厂三百名生产人员中有二十一个盲人、六个白痴、七个神经病患者、二十个流浪儿童，三十九个青壮年残废，八十个老年残废，两个哑子，其余都是老弱妇女。因此，社会福利生产的经营管理方法，必须适应这些人的具体情况，与一般工厂有很大的不同。赚钱多的要生产，赚钱少的也要生产，只要比单纯救济强，就可以生产；能够集中起来的人，就集中生产，不能集中生产的人，就把原料送到家里去生产；在集中生产的单位内，能够站着生产的就站着生产，不能站着生产的就坐下来生产，能整日生产的就整日生产，不能整日生产的就半日生产；在生产上又要根据盲、聋哑、残老等不同的情况进行分工。如果要一般工厂接收安排这些人参加生产，对它们的生产是不利的。
    不论城镇农村，都能组织社会保障性质的福利生产
    农村能不能组织这种社会保障性质的福利生产呢？有些农村已经在这样做了。辽宁省建平县全县三十八个乡一个镇，已建立起福利生产单位九十八个，其中有一个是县营的，其他都是社、乡、镇营的。这些单位主要是为农业生产服务的，小型多样，就地取材，投资少，收益大，容人多，主要依靠大家动手用优抚、救济费给以必要扶持。建立起来以后，生活困难的人大部分很快就可以达到生产自给。该县已经提出“1958年生产自给，1959年不用国家救济”的口号。河北省蓟县县委决定这种社会福利生产要做到“乡乡有工厂、社社有作坊”。安徽省多数县普遍实行了组织五保户集体生产的办法，如芜湖县鲤鱼社组织尚有一部分劳动能力并可以集中的五保户三十人集体生产，1956年除归还农业社的投资外，每人平均收入六十六点七元，1957年每人平均收入七十五元，超过了一般社员的生活水平，并且有了公共积累，今年打算种菜、种瓜、栽藕、栽菱角、养鸡、养兔、养蚕、糊火柴盒等，预计可收入五千五百元，县委除在全县推广他们集中生产的经验以外，并把这个生产队命名为“幸福老年队”。
    我们原来认为农村组织社会福利生产有困难，事实证明是可以组织的。生活困难的残老半劳动力，除了经常性的农村副业生产以外，依靠参加劳动强度很大的农业生产不能解决问题，轻微的农业活计又不经常，而且收入很少。现在在全民办工业、乡乡社社办工业的情况下，农村组织社会福利生产有了广阔的门路。
    要不要花很多钱呢？不需要。城镇组织生产发展到这样大的规模，一般的没有专门拨过钱。它们的生产资金是用三种办法解决的：第一，勤俭创业，白手起家，逐步积累，由小到大；第二，从银行贷款，定期偿还；第三，用一部分优抚、救济费作为生产投资。各地已经组织起来的生产单位大多数是白手起家的，这样的生产单位占全部生产单位的90％以上。例如蚌埠市光荣麻刀厂是由一把菜刀，一个木墩子起家，现在已发展为有工人二百四十多人，资金十四万元，年产麻刀三百万斤，并有电动机械装备的工厂。沈阳市最近一个半月组织起来二千七百三十人，建成的三十九个福利生产单位，政府未花一文钱。吉林汪清县烈军属服务社是1951年由五名残废军人用四十五元残废金建立的。他们用这些钱买了四只母鸡和一千零七个蛋，把孵出的小鸡养大以后卖了买机器，到1957年底已经发展为轧棉、缝纫、食品、铁工厂等十三个生产单位，拥有十三万元的资金，吸收了贫困的烈属、军属、残废军人等四百零七人参加生产。它不仅从根本上解决了参加生产人员的生活困难问题，还买了和修建了一批房屋，命名为“荣军街”，无代价地供给全城关镇无房的烈属、军属居住，而且还供给十四名烈属孤儿上学，几年来共开支孤儿教养费八千多元，以上这些事例，充分地说明，只要发动群众，依靠群众，他们是能够想出各种各样的办法来的。
    现在各城镇的口号都是“一年内实现优抚补助费和社会救济费全部生产自给”，农村虽然条件差一点，但这样办，两年内达到生产自给也是可以办到的。这说明，认为社会福利事业没钱不能办，钱少不能办好，是错误的。社会福利生产发展下去，所创造的财富不仅能够从根本上解决参加生产人员的生活困难问题，而且完全可能为国家和集体，提供大量开展其他社会福利事业的支出。这样，就会在社会福利事业上出现一种新局面：服务对象的生活由贫困走向富裕，集体的负担减轻了，国家的支出减少了。这就会在实际上体现少奇同志报告中所指出的关于解决福利问题的这些原则：“合理地兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面的利益”，“有利于巩固和发展社会主义的所有制”，“有利于社会生产的发展”。
    城镇已经组织起来的和今年内将要组织起来的优抚、救济对象和盲、聋哑人，将达到一百三十万人左右。农村的社会福利生产也将得到很大的发展。以后，我们准备逐步地把企业内既不够退休条件，又不能从事一般厂矿生产的老、弱、残废的职工，组织到这种福利生产中去，通过生产解决他们的生活问题，以减轻企业的负担；还可以逐步把机关、企业职工家属有劳动力而生活困难的人也组织起来。
    社会福利生产事业实际上已经形成地方经济的一个组成部分，必须纳入当地整个经济规划之中，在党的领导下统一安排，同有关部门密切协作。许多地方过去就是这样作的，今后也必须这样作。
    组织社会保障性质的福利生产不是一时的权宜之计，特别是组织残废者和盲聋哑人进行生产，更是一项长期的福利事业，因为致残的原因很多，完全避免是不可能的，在组织这些人进行生产的时候，必须在不影响他们身体健康的原则下进行。同时还应该加强科学技术的研究工作，力求运用科学技术成就为他们提供更好的参加生产的条件。这就要：
    第一，建立医务劳动鉴定的研究工作，即研究什么样的残废、丧失多少劳动能力的人，适合从事什么样的生产，以便逐步实现生产上的科学分工。
    第二，逐步改善残废者的劳动条件，研究改良适合他们的生产工具、机械设备，从半机械到实现机械化，以减轻他们的劳动强度。
    第三，建立假肢工业科学研究机构，使我国假肢质量在三、五年内赶上国际水平，以便辅助残废者从事生产劳动。
    第四，逐步开展残废人员的职业训练工作，帮助残废者在残废后能够迅速转入新的生产建设岗位。更好地发挥复员军人在建设中的突击作用
    党中央曾经指出过，“复员军人是一批值得宝贵的积极力量”。在反右派斗争中，在基层社会主义大辩论中，确实证明了他们在思想上和政治上的可靠性，在工农业生产大跃进中，又一次证明了他们是生产建设中的突击手。
    在党发出工农业生产大跃进的号召以后，复员军人精神奋发，斗志昂扬，争先恐后地制定个人跃进规划，上书表示决心。从城镇到农村，数千人，数万人，纷纷集会，挑战声，报捷声，响遍各地，他们发出共同的誓言：决心当大跃进的尖兵。接着，他们就在各自的岗位上，以战斗的姿态投入了跃进的高潮。先进的更先进，落后的也赶上来了。在战争中两次立下特等功的人民功臣吴森福，在上海大同铁工厂，以十七天的时间完成了五十三天的工作量。山西省河曲县城关乡奕二贵，原来不很先进，参加过县的誓师大会以后，担任了社的突击队长，白天领导九十多名妇女培地埂一千九百丈，夜间领导二百二十名突击队员“大战九娘滩”，七个夜间就修水田一百亩，种苇子四亩，植树一万八千株，现在已被评选为甲等模范突击队长。
    在这样伟大的时代里，复员军人对于只是完成自己的生产任务是不满足的，他们要求“那里困难到那里去”，因此，纷纷组成四十勇士、英雄连、钢铁连、尖刀连、猛虎连、飞虎队等等，这种生产突击队的组织到处出现。河北省抚宁县复员军人挖了一条三十里长的水渠，中间有一条山岭阻挡，县委提出的计划是七天凿通，而复员军人组成的尖兵连一天一夜就凿通了。遵化县东陵乡的复员军人英雄连，为了实现“四好东陵乡”，首先用六天的时间完成了一个畜水库和养鱼池。接着又接受了一个扩修渠道的任务，乡计划半月完成，他们也只用六天的时间就完成了。现在遵化县的生产突击队已由一千六百三十四名复员军人串连二千七百六十名民兵，组成了五个英雄营，十七个英雄连，十一个英雄排，担负了二十六个水库、两个英雄坝和一个“万猪场”的修建工程。农村是这样，工厂也是这样。北京有线电厂五百多名复员军人组织了十六个突击队、尖兵队、跃进队，超额完成了第一季度的跃进生产任务，并且要保证全年为国家节约一万两黄金。
    复员军人不只是建设中的积极力量，而且是一支突击力量
    对于复员军人在社会主义建设中的积极作用，许多人是了解的，但也有过一些人不了解，甚至他们抓住个别复员军人表现不好的事例来否定绝大多数复员军人的积极作用。事实对这些人的观点作了彻底的批判。复员军人不只是建设中的积极力量，而且是一支突击力量。
    复员军人能不能成为突击力量，关键在于是否充分地信赖他们，经常地教育他们，放手地使用他们。只有这样，他们才会感到党对他们的关怀，干劲愈来愈大；也只有这样，他们才会永远保持高度的革命热情和旺盛的斗志。
    要教育他们，依靠他们，使用他们，就要通过一定的形式。没有一定的形式，只是把他们和一般群众进行一样的教育，那是不能满足他们的要求的，也不足以发挥他们的作用。现在许多地方都是通过复员军人学习站、学习小组、座谈会、代表会等形式加强对他们的教育。经验证明，这是他们进行自我教育，是党教育、动员他们在各项工作中发挥积极作用的必要形式。河北抚宁县委提出“抓复员军人要像抓党团员一样”，所以他们在进行各项工作的时候，除了在党团员中传达贯彻以外，还要在复员军人中传达贯彻，并向他们提出具体的行动要求。抚宁县、遵化县的复员军人，在生产大跃进中，其所以能够发挥巨大的作用，决定关键就在于县、区、乡各级党委，对教育和使用复员军人这一点非常重视。
    在特别需要的时候，组织各种形式的复员军人突击队，是适合他们的特点的，因为他们都具备高度的组织性，顽强的苦干精神，而我们党在生产建设的道路上又常常碰到“坚固堡垒”，需要大量的突击手；在平时则应该组织教育他们经常活动在一般群众之中，起带头骨干作用。河北遵化、抚宁对复员军人突击队是采取分散和集中相结合的办法，平时化整为零，带动群众生产，特别必要时化零为整，突击完成最艰巨的生产任务。
    有的地方提出要注意防止对复员军人只使用不教育的偏向，这是对的。但是，对他们的社会主义教育必须避免空洞的说教，只有组织和帮助他们参加实际工作和生产斗争，才能使他们成为社会主义建设的骨干力量，才能对他们进行最好的也是最实际的政治教育。
    少奇同志在八大二次会议上所做的报告向全国人民响亮地提出了“技术革命”和“文化革命”的号召，这是我国人民今后社会主义建设的伟大任务。
    对复员军人的政治思想教育工作应成为今后安置工作的中心任务
    各地的情况表明，复员退伍军人在当前的技术革命和文化革命高潮中也是一批积极力量。国营北京有线电厂喷漆工段的米恒福、张学龄，改变单干工艺分工为合作流水作业法，提高生产效率四倍多。运输公司汽车修理厂糜伯先，创造、改良八种配装汽车零件的工具，使用这些工具一年能完成二年半的生产任务。第一机械工业部第三设计院杨铣，把比重分析法改为比重计和液移管联合分析法，使操作时间由四小时缩短为九十分钟。他还领导大家试制成功了一种双式洗瓶器，使工作效率提高八倍。杭州市邮电局机务员王培英改进操作方法，连续十一次刷新纪录，将整修一部电话机的时间从二百五十分钟缩短到三十五分钟。南京市电子管厂的李正标和他的战友们，苦干两昼夜制成“真空烤克脂”和“真空密封膏”，据南京报告，质量赶上了美国，成本仅相当于美国的三十五分之一，把英国抛在后边了。徐州市主要由复员军人组成的电器修理小组，创造了五用收音机（收音、录音、播音、放音并带唱盘）。山西省河曲县楼子营乡秦家梁村，十一户，只一人识字，退伍军人刘存厚把这个文盲村搞成了扫盲模范村。
    全国五百五十八万复员军人大部分都有一定的文化程度，其中还有六十多万技术人员，如汽车司机，飞机驾驶，推土起重司机，航海轮机手，坦克手，电讯人员，医务人员，气象人员，雷达人员，设计人员，测绘人员，车工，钳工，焊工，铆工，旋工，电工等等各种各样的技术人员。复员军人不仅有干劲，而且都有一股子钻劲，在党的“技术革命”和“文化革命”号召的鼓舞下，只要重视使用和有计划地培养，他们也一定能够成为技术革命和文化革命的积极分子。
    对复员军人的政治鼓动工作和思想教育工作应该成为今后复员安置工作的中心任务。但是对于年老病弱而有困难的少部分人的照顾也是绝对不能放松的，做好这一点才能更好地发挥他们参加社会主义建设的积极性。
