Why?

    Bread Hardens
    Fresh bread is soft and delicious, but bread that has been left for a long time becomes hard, sometimes even difficult to cut with a knife.
    At first glance, the reason is simple: the moisture in the bread evaporates, so it hardens. In fact, this explanation is not complete. If it were only due to the loss of moisture, then putting the bread in humid air should make it soft again, right? But no, the bread still becomes hard and brittle, and a layer of mold grows on the outside.
    Bread is a colloidal substance. The molecules that make up bread are interwoven to form a network, and moisture is in the gaps of the network and in the pores after the baking soda ferments. Molecules attract each other at every moment. Therefore, these gaps gradually shrink. At this time, the moisture remaining in them is expelled to the outside as they become tight and shrink. Therefore, the longer the bread is left, the more moisture is expelled from it, and the harder the bread becomes.

专栏：为什么？

    面包会变硬
    新鲜的面包松软可口，放久了的面包就发硬，有时连用刀子都不容易切割了。
    粗看起来，原因很简单，因为面包里的水分蒸发了，所以就发硬。其实这种解释并不全面。如果说仅是失掉水分的缘故，那么，我们把面包放在潮湿的空气里，就应该不硬了吧！不然，面包仍然变得硬崩崩的，在外面还多了一层霉。
    面包是一种胶体状的物质，组成面包的分子之间相互交织地形成一个网状，水分就在网的空隙中和小苏打发酵后的孔隙中。分子和分子之间，每时每刻都在相互吸引。因此，这些空隙就逐渐缩小。这时留在其中的水分就随着它们的紧密和缩小被排斥到外面。因此，面包放得越久，里面被排斥出来的水分就越多，面包也就越硬。
