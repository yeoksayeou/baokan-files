Xinhua News Agency Composite Report: According to a report in Damascus' "Victory" newspaper on the 20th, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oueidat summoned the US Ambassador to Lebanon on the 19th and formally notified him on behalf of the Lebanese Parliament that "the war in Lebanon is Lebanon's internal affair, and any foreign intervention, even if it is carried out at the request of the Lebanese government, will be regarded by the Lebanese people as aggression against them."

The newspaper said that Oueidat also issued a statement on the 19th condemning the conspiracy to send international forces or American and British troops to Lebanon in an attempt to turn Lebanon's internal problems into international issues. He announced that if imperialist countries attempt to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs or land troops in Lebanon, he will join the people in fighting the imperialists.

The newspaper also said that the Lebanese National Front has prepared a memorandum for Hammarskjöld, which will state that any intervention will be regarded as an interference in Lebanon's freedom and sovereignty.

According to newspaper reports, Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt announced on the 19th that once foreign forces intervene in Lebanon, the People's Army Headquarters will request all brotherly and friendly countries to send volunteers. He also said that the People's Army will use all tools and weapons to fight foreign troops entering Lebanon.

According to TASS Beirut on the 19th, Adnan Hakim, leader of the Supporters Party, said regarding the UN Secretary-General's visit to Beirut: "If Hammarskjöld comes to Lebanon preparing to send international police forces to Lebanon, then we can tell him: ...we do not want anyone to interfere in our country's internal affairs, and we will fight against all those who attempt to send foreign troops to our country."

At the same time, after United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld arrived in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on the morning of the 19th, he immediately held a five-hour meeting with senior members of the United Nations Observer Group who had arrived earlier, listening to their reports on the situation in Lebanon and the work of the Observer Group.

That afternoon, Hammarskjöld met with Lebanon's pro-Western President Chamoun for forty-five minutes. The content of the meeting was not disclosed. It was reported that as Hammarskjöld arrived at the Presidential Palace, US Ambassador McClintock left there.

As of the 19th, thirty-nine United Nations observers had entered Lebanon. It is estimated that this will increase to fifty by the end of the week.

The headquarters of the United Nations Observer Committee is located in Beirut. It is reported that UN observers have gone to the fiercely contested second largest city of Tripoli and some areas near the Syrian border to observe and establish observation posts there. The observation team is trying to advance to other border areas of Lebanon. According to observers, half of Lebanon's border is in the hands of the insurgents.

On the other hand, the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to intervene militarily in Lebanon is becoming increasingly obvious.

US Secretary of Defense McElroy said at a press conference held in Quantico, Virginia on the 19th that he had been discussing with Secretary of State Dulles the issue of "the ability to cope with a limited war" in the Middle East. He said that if US troops "need" to intervene in Lebanon, he will "not hesitate" to use B-47 bombers, which can carry ordinary bombs and can also use atomic weapons in any "limited war."

In the British House of Lords, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Holm, speaking on behalf of the government, said that the British government would "fully support" the United Nations' activities in Lebanon.

At the same time, the British government continued to airlift troops to Cyprus on the 19th. It is reported that Cyprus has become a large military camp, just like during the Suez Crisis. After the arrival of the First Guards Brigade, Britain will concentrate fifteen infantry battalions, three paratrooper battalions, one cavalry regiment, one artillery regiment, and a Royal Marine Corps on the island.

In Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, sources close to the British Army Headquarters pointed out that there are strong indications that Britain's major troop deployments to Cyprus are to carry out missions unrelated to Cyprus.

The arrival of Lieutenant General Bower, Commander-in-Chief of British Land Forces in the Middle East, in London from Cyprus on the 19th, added to the growing signs that military intervention in Lebanon is being stepped up. British newspapers made it clear that Bower's arrival in London was actually to discuss planned armed intervention in Lebanon.

    黎巴嫩议长警告美国大使
    外国干涉将被认为侵略
    琼布拉特宣布人民军将同外国干涉者作战
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：大马士革“胜利报”20日报道，黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰19日召见了美国驻黎巴嫩大使，并且代表黎巴嫩议会正式通知他：“在黎巴嫩进行的战争是黎巴嫩的内政，任何外国干涉，那怕是应黎巴嫩政府的要求而进行的干涉，都将被黎巴嫩人民认为是对他们的侵略”。
    这家报纸说，奥塞兰19日还发表声明，谴责那种企图派遣国际部队或者美国和英国部队到黎巴嫩，把黎巴嫩的内政问题变为国际问题的阴谋。他宣布，假如帝国主义国家试图干涉黎巴嫩内政或者派兵在黎巴嫩登陆，他将加入人民的行列同帝国主义者斗争。
    这家报纸还说，黎巴嫩的民族阵线已经准备好了一份给哈马舍尔德的备忘录，备忘录将表示，任何干涉都要被认为是对黎巴嫩自由和主权的干涉。
    据报纸消息，黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特19日宣布，一旦外国对黎巴嫩进行干涉，人民军司令部将要求所有兄弟国家和友好国家派遣志愿军。他还说，人民军将要用所有的工具和武器来同进入黎巴嫩的外国军队作战。
    另据塔斯社贝鲁特19日讯：支持者党领袖阿德南·哈基姆就联合国秘书长访问贝鲁特发表谈话说：“如果哈马舍尔德到黎巴嫩来是准备向黎巴嫩派遣国际警察部队，那我们可以告诉他：……我们不希望任何人干涉我们国家的内政，我们将同一切企图向我国派遣外国军队的人作斗争。”
    与此同时，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在19日清晨到达黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特后，随即同先期到达的联合国观察委员会的高级成员举行了五小时会议，听取他们关于黎巴嫩局势和观察组工作的汇报。
    当天下午，哈马舍尔德同黎巴嫩的亲西方总统夏蒙会谈了四十五分钟。会谈内容没有透露。据报道，正在哈马舍尔德抵达总统府时，美国大使麦克林托克离开那里。
    到19日止，已经有三十九名联合国观察员进入黎巴嫩。估计到本周末将增加到五十人。
    联合国观察委员会总部设在贝鲁特。据悉，联合国观察员已经前往战况激烈的第二大城的黎波里市和靠近叙利亚边境的一些地区观察，并在那里建立了观察站。观察小组正在设法向黎巴嫩的其它边境地区前进。据观察员说，黎巴嫩的一半边界是在起义者手中。
    另一方面，美英两国准备武装干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋已越来越明显。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊19日在弗吉尼亚州康特戈举行的一次记者招待会上说，他一直在同国务卿杜勒斯商讨在中东“应付一场有限战争的能力”的问题。他说，如果美国军队“需要”干涉黎巴嫩，他将“毫不犹豫地”使用B—47型轰炸机，这些轰炸机可以携带普通炸弹，也可以在任何“有限战争”中使用原子武器。
    在英国上院，代表政府发言的联邦关系大臣霍姆说，英国政府将“充分支持”联合国在黎巴嫩的活动。
    同时，英国政府19日还源源不断向塞浦路斯空运军队。据报道，塞浦路斯已经同苏伊士事件时期一样成了一个大兵营，在第一近卫旅到达后，英国在这个岛上将集中有十五个步兵营、三个伞兵营、一个骑兵团、一个炮兵团和一支皇家海军陆战队。
    在塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚，接近英国陆军司令部的人士指出，有种种强烈迹象表明，英国大事调兵遣将到塞浦路斯，是为了执行同塞浦路斯毫无关系的任务。
    英国驻中东地面部队总司令鲍尔中将19日从塞浦路斯到达伦敦，这件事增加了正在不断加强的迹象，就是对黎巴嫩的军事干涉正在加紧策划中。英国报纸明白指出，鲍尔来伦敦实际上是要讨论计划中的对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。
