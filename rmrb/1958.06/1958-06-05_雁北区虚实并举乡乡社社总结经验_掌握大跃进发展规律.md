Yanbei District Summarizes Experiences by Combining the Real and the Virtual at Every Level to Grasp the Laws of the Great Leap Forward

(Reported by this newspaper) The Yanbei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province recently decided to launch a summary movement in every county, township, and commune during the "intermission" period when spring plowing and sowing have basically ended and summer production has not yet fully started. This summary aims to review the victory of the Great Leap Forward in Yanbei District this spring; to gain experience and lessons to guide future work; and to promote cadres to learn the working methods of combining "virtual" and "real," and linking theory with practice.

This spring, 1.6 million farmers outside Yanmen Pass, with soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, unveiled the most glorious page in the history of the frontier, overturning the long-standing "Yanbei is backward" theory, the complaints about heaven (frequent disasters), the complaints about earth (barren land), and the complaints about poor natural conditions. The cowardly spirit was replaced by the heroic spirit inspired by the all-people rectification. Under the encouragement of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, Yanbei farmers accomplished in one spring what could not be done in the past many years. In less than half a year from last winter to this spring, 1.46 million mu of irrigated land were developed, equal to three times the amount in the more than 2,000 years before liberation. The water conservancy projects under construction can irrigate another 1.55 million mu, which is also equal to three times the amount in more than 2,000 years. Adding the achievements of water conservancy construction in the past eight years, the 7 million mu of basic farmland in the district will basically be irrigated before "July 1st" this year. In history, the vast forest area accumulated over more than 2,000 years was only 500,000 mu, but 1.18 million mu were afforested in one spring this year, which is equal to twice the amount in more than 2,000 years. The backward habit of extensive planting and low yield, and extensive cultivation has also been completely changed. The quality of spring sowing, the speed of progress, and the amount of fertilizer application are all unprecedented. According to statistics in the first half of May, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu in the district reached 9,000 jin, an increase of 5.5 times compared with last year. The amount of fertilizer applied in one year is equal to the total amount of fertilizer applied in the past eight years. Driven by the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, great achievements have also been made in industry, culture, education, health, and the elimination of the four pests.

Because Yanbei District has achieved these great achievements, the Yanbei District Committee decided to seriously summarize the work this spring to greatly promote the prestige of socialism, boost the morale of the people; further liberate people's minds and broaden their horizons; and further promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, being unstoppable, and being invincible.

In the Great Leap Forward this spring, Yanbei District also exposed many new problems and new contradictions in the process of advancement, and at the same time, many new creations and new experiences in solving these problems and contradictions emerged. The infinite wisdom of the vast number of cadres and masses has made many problems that were originally considered difficult to solve, easily solved. Of course, due to the large scale of the movement, the rapid momentum, and the rapid progress, some individual and partial shortcomings are inevitable. Therefore, the Yanbei District Committee decided to seriously summarize the work this spring, so that people can gradually grasp the laws of the Great Leap Forward – how to solve what problems, how to deal with what contradictions, what is right to do, and what is wrong to do; and correctly understand all the phenomena that occur in the leap forward – what is the mainstream, what is the tributary, what is the essence, what is the non-essence, what are the nine fingers, and what is one finger. In this way, those who feel that the more they leap forward, the more problems there are, and who are overwhelmed by the problems, can get methods and wisdom; and at the same time, those who feel that they are "almost there" and therefore cannot see the problems can see that there are still problems in the process of advancement. Thus, we can prepare for commanding the second, third… battle from the perspective of guiding ideology, working methods, and leadership style, and ensure that we move from victory to greater victory.

The Yanbei District Committee also decided to promote cadres to learn the working methods of combining "virtual" and "real" and linking theory with practice through this summary, and to change the current atmosphere of cadres not engaging in "virtual," not knowing how to "virtual," and not daring to "virtual." To this end, the Yanbei District Committee requires all localities to attach great importance to this summary movement, and to oppose perfunctory and careless work. The county party committees should make a more comprehensive and systematic summary; each township and commune should summarize what they feel most deeply and what is most meaningful based on their specific circumstances; in addition to summarizing their own business work, all departments should especially focus on summarizing their support for the Great Leap Forward in agriculture.

Regarding the specific methods of summarizing, the Yanbei District Committee proposed to oppose closed-doorism and fabricating things out of thin air. As with any work, the District Committee believes that making a summary must also follow the mass line, consult and research with the masses, and hold symposiums. Townships and communes can also launch mass debates when summarizing. Free debates should be launched within the leadership core at all levels, expressing their own opinions, advocating independent thinking, and promoting the spirit of originality. The responsible comrades of the county party committees should personally write articles. After such a summary, it is required to: raise practical work to the level of theoretical understanding, and in turn use the summarized theory to guide future practice.

### 雁北区虚实并举乡乡社社总结经验  掌握大跃进发展规律

　　雁北区虚实并举乡乡社社总结经验
    掌握大跃进发展规律
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：中共山西省雁北地委最近决定，在春耕播种已经基本结束、夏季生产还未全面开始的“间歇”时间内，开展一次县县乡乡社社的总结运动，通过这次总结来检阅雁北区今春大跃进的胜利；来取得指导今后工作的经验教训；并促进干部学会“务虚”和“务实”相结合、理论和实际相联系的工作方法。
    今年春天，雁门关外一百六十万农民，用冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧，揭开了塞外历史上最光辉的一页，打翻了由来已久的“雁北落后论”，怨天（灾害频繁）怨地（土地瘠薄）怨自然条件不好的懦气，为全民整风后所鼓起的豪迈气概所代替。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，雁北农民以一个春天的时间，办了过去多少年办不到的事。去冬今春不到半年的时间发展了一百四十六万亩水浇地，等于解放前两千多年的三倍。正在施工的水利工程还可浇地一百五十五万亩，又等于两千多年的三倍。加上过去八年来的水利建设成绩，今年“七一”前全区七百万亩基本农田将可基本上实现水利化。历史上两千多年来遗留下的大片林不过五十万亩，而今年一个春天就造林一百一十八万亩，等于两千多年的两倍。历史上广种薄收、耕作粗放的落后习惯也完全改变。春播质量之高，进度之快，施肥之多，都为前所未有。到5月上半月的统计，全区每亩施肥量平均达到九千斤，比去年增加了五点五倍。一年的施肥量等于过去八年的施肥总和。在农业大跃进的带动下，工业、文教、卫生、除四害等也都取得了很大的成绩。
    由于雁北地区取得了这些巨大的成就，雁北地委决定认真地总结一下今春的工作，来大大地扬社会主义的威风、长人民群众的志气；进一步解放人们的思想、开阔人们的眼界；进一步发扬人们敢想敢说、敢作敢为、势如破竹、所向披靡的共产主义风格。
    今春的大跃进中，雁北区也暴露了许多前进中的新问题和新矛盾，同时出现了许多解决这些问题和矛盾的新创造、新经验。广大干部和群众的无穷无尽的智慧，使得许多原来认为难以解决的问题，一一迎刃而解。当然，由于运动规模大、来势猛、进展快，免不了发生一些个别的局部的缺点。因此，雁北地委决定认真地总结今春的工作，使人们逐步摸到大跃进的发展规律——什么问题怎解决，什么矛盾怎处理，怎么办就对，怎么办不对；并正确理解跃进中发生的一切现象——什么是主流、什么是支流，什么是本质、什么是非本质，什么是九个指头、什么是一个指头。这样就可以使那些感到越跃进问题越多，因而被问题压得挺不起腰来的人，得到办法和智慧；同时也可以使那些感到已经“差不多”了，因而看不到问题的人，看到前进中还有问题。如此，就为指挥第二个、第三个……战役，从指导思想上、工作方法上、领导作风上，作好准备，保证由胜利走向更大的胜利。
    雁北地委还决定通过这次总结，促进干部学会“务虚”和“务实”相结合、理论和实际相联系的工作方法，改变当前干部中不去“务虚”、不会“务虚”、不敢“务虚”的风气。为此，雁北地委要求各地十分重视这次总结运动，反对敷衍塞责，潦草从事。县委要作出比较全面、系统的总结；各乡社要根据本乡本社的具体情况，总结出那些感受最深和最有意义的东西；各部门除了总结自己的业务工作外，特别要着重总结一下对农业大跃进的支援。
    在总结的具体作法上，雁北地委提出，要反对闭门造车，向壁虚构。同进行任何工作一样，地委认为作总结也必须走群众路线，和群众商量、研究，开座谈会。乡和社在总结时还可以发动群众大鸣大放大辩论。在各级领导核心中要展开自由争辩、各抒己见，提倡独立思考，发扬独创精神，县委负责同志要亲自动笔写文章。经过这样总结之后，要求作到：把实际工作提高到理论上去认识，反过来再用总结出来的理论指导今后的实际。
