    A Note

    In de Gaulle's activities to usurp power, the right-wing leader of the French Socialist Party, Mollet, is playing an extremely important role. This Socialist leader, in order to persuade Socialist Party members to support de Gaulle's coming to power, specifically went to see de Gaulle once. Mollet described this meeting to reporters, saying: "I spent a great moment in my life in the company of a truly great figure." The obsequiousness of this Socialist leader towards the great figure in his mind is truly sickening.
    Mollet's obsequiousness is not just an infatuation with de Gaulle personally, but also a service to fascism. People know that this Socialist leader has praised de Gaulle in parliament more than once, and has even ordered Socialist Party members to be prohibited from taking united action with Communists in the anti-fascist struggle. Furthermore, according to Western news agency reports, he will also serve as Deputy Prime Minister in de Gaulle's future military dictatorship government. Therefore, the true face of this Socialist leader is nothing more than an agent of the fascist forces.

    代理人
    在戴高乐篡夺政权的活动中，法国社会党的右翼领袖摩勒正充当着一个极其重要的角色。这位社会党的领袖为了劝说社会党的议员支持戴高乐上台，特地去参见了一次戴高乐。摩勒对记者们形容他的这一次参见说：“我在跟一个真正伟大的人物的相处中度过了我一生中的一个伟大时刻。”这位社会党领袖对他心目中的伟大人物的媚态真可以令人作呕了。
    摩勒的这种媚态，不只是对戴高乐个人的倾倒，而且也是对法西斯的效劳。人们知道，这位社会党领袖曾不止一次地在议会中赞扬过戴高乐，并且还曾下令禁止社会党人在反法西斯斗争中同共产党人采取一致行动，甚至据西方通讯社的报道，他还将在戴高乐未来的军事独裁政府中担任副总理之职。所以，这位社会党领袖的真正面目不过是法西斯势力的一个代理人而已。
