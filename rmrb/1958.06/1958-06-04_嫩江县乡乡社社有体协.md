　　Nenjiang County: Every Township and Commune Has a Sports Association
    (By our newspaper) After twenty-two days of effort, Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, has established 136 sports associations in factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and rural areas throughout the county, with more than 8,000 members. This has resulted in a central sports association in every township and a grassroots sports association in every commune.
    In the process of establishing the sports associations, the Nenjiang County Sports Commission received active support from Party and government leaders. The County People's Committee promptly issued instructions and sent cadres to form a sports association establishment task force to provide guidance in various townships. In grassroots units, cadres from the communes and elementary school teachers served as the backbone for establishing the sports associations, led by leading cadres from the communes. Due to the importance attached by leaders and the efforts of the masses, the sports associations were established rapidly and smoothly in Nenjiang County.
    Currently, all sports associations have begun activities.
    In order to consolidate the grassroots sports associations in rural areas, Nenjiang County also plans to conduct a training session for sports activists from various communes in June, with physical education teachers from central schools in each township serving as instructors, to cultivate them as the backbone of the sports associations.
