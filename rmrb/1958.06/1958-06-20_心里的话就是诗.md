    Words from the Heart are Poetry
    Kang?
    Moving Jiangnan to North China
    Carrying mountains and lifting water, pushing lakes,
    To move Jiangnan to North China;
    Rushing to build ships and hoist sails,
    With the wind, North China crosses to Jiangnan.
    A Thousand Jin of Grain, Ten Thousand Jin of Sweet Potatoes
    A thousand jin of grain, ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes,
    Spare plots of land for planting melon seeds,
    Four fertilizers, four waterings, seven hoeings for the wheat,
    Effort surpassing an embroidery girl.
    Water, Soil, Fruit Trees to Nurture the Mountain Slopes
    Chipping stones, cutting mountain tops,
    Opening springs, digging wells, excavating ditches;
    On the mountain slopes, fish-scale pits,
    Fruit trees, peppers, and willows.
    Cover the "Tortoise Back" with a Flower and Fruit Mountain,
    To keep the mountain slopes from losing water and soil;
    Rain from the sky and springs from the earth are under our control,
    Fruit trees will have great harvests every year.
   (Note) "Tortoise Back" is the name of a mountain in Dawangdian Township, which the people here have now renamed "Flower and Fruit Mountain."

    心里的话就是诗
    康?
    要把江南搬华北
    担山抬水推湖泊，
    要把江南搬华北；
    赶造轮船赶挂帆，
    顺风华北过江南。
    千斤粮食万斤薯
    千斤粮食万斤薯，
    空闲片地点瓜子，
    四肥四水七锄麦，
    功夫赛过绣花女。
    水土果木养山坡
    锛石头，砍山头，
    开泉凿井挖渠沟；
    山坡上，鱼鳞坑，
    果木花椒和杨柳。
    龟背盖起花果山，
    山坡水土不流走；
    天雨地泉咱们管，
    果木年年大丰收。
   （注）“龟背”是大王店乡一座山的名字，如今这里人民已给改名叫“花果山”。
