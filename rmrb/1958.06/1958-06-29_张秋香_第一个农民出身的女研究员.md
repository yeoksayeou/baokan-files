Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th: Zhang Qiuxiang, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model and deputy director of the Balidian Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has been hired as a special researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences. She is the first female researcher from a peasant background in our country.

Zhang Qiuxiang is an ordinary rural woman from a poor peasant family and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. With the support of the Party, she conducted various bold experiments in cotton planting techniques and finally achieved a high-yield record of producing over 500 kilograms of seed cotton per mu for three consecutive years. Based on the growth characteristics of cotton at various stages, she has developed ten major cotton planting experiences, from land preparation and sowing to picking cotton and sweeping fallen leaves, including hoeing Meng Hua (shallow hoeing when cotton seedlings first emerge), appropriately delaying seedling setting time, hand-operated thinning, giving vaccinations (also called washing the face, for drought prevention), five-step pruning and topping, and draining flower boxes and rainwater after rain, totaling more than one hundred techniques. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee pointed out in its instructions on promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience: Zhang Qiuxiang's experience of producing 500 kilograms of seed cotton per mu is a relatively complete, scientific, and advanced cotton planting experience that combines technology and farmers' experience. Now, Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting technology has blossomed all over Shaanxi Province. The 15,000 "Qiuxiang Fields" (high-yield cotton fields) named after Zhang Qiuxiang are operated entirely according to Zhang Qiuxiang's experience. This year, Zhang Qiuxiang is also leading a cotton farming group to conduct high-yield experiments on a 4.5 mu cotton field, aiming for a yield of 500 kilograms of ginned cotton per mu.

    张秋香——第一个农民出身的女研究员
    据新华社西安28日电　全国著名农业劳动模范、陕西省渭南县双王乡八里店农业社副主任张秋香，已应聘任陕西省农业科学研究所特约研究员。这是我国第一个农民出身的女研究员。
    张秋香是一个贫农出身的普通农村妇女，是中国共产党党员。在党的支持下，她在植棉技术方面经过各种大胆的试验，终于获得了连续三年亩产千斤籽棉的高额丰产纪录。她根据棉花各个时期的生长特征，研究出了从整地、播种到拾花、扫落叶等十大植棉经验，包括锄梦花（棉苗刚现行时节进行浅锄）、适当推迟定苗时间、手摇间苗、打防疫针（也叫洗脸，目的在于防旱）、五步整枝打卡、以及雨后倒花盒雨水等一百多种技术。中共陕西省委在决定推广张秋香植棉经验的指示中指出：张秋香亩产千斤籽棉的经验，是一个比较完整的、科学的、先进技术与农民经验相结合的植棉经验。现在，张秋香的植棉技术已经在陕西省遍地开花。以张秋香命名的一万五千块“秋香田”（棉花高额丰产田），完全按照张秋香的经验进行操作。今年，张秋香又在领导着一个务棉小组，在一块四亩五分大的棉田里，进行亩产千斤皮棉高额丰产试验。
