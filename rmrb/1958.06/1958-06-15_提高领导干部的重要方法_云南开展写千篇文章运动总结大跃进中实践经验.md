    An Important Method for Improving Leading Cadres
    Yunnan Launches Movement to Write Thousands of Articles, Summarizing Practical Experience in the Great Leap Forward
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a movement throughout the province, among leading cadres at and above the county Party secretary level, to write thousands of articles, focusing on summarizing practical experience from the Great Leap Forward.

    The Provincial Committee pointed out: The content of these articles can reflect the situation in ideological work and in various aspects such as industry, agriculture, culture, education, finance and trade. Leading cadres at all levels should select the aspects or issues about which they have the deepest feelings and the most experience during the Great Leap Forward as their themes. The articles should not be limited to discussing specific events, nor should they be empty pronouncements, striving for the unity of material and ideas. The Provincial Committee believes that theory comes from practice and must serve practice; it is necessary to break the cadres' mystical or confused notions about theory, and to use practical work to explain dialectics. Any understanding that can explain and solve practical problems and conforms to objective laws is theory. It is necessary to break down superstitions and promote ideological liberation. As long as the direction is correct and everything is for the realization of the General Line, we should be bold and develop our ideas, so the articles can have their own language and be lively.

    The Provincial Committee requires that: Secretaries should personally take action, and Party committees and propaganda departments should provide specific organization, to ensure that the articles are written and submitted to the Provincial Committee in batches according to the specified quantity within the next three months. In addition to being selectively given by the Provincial Committee to theoretical publications that will be published and publicly published in the Yunnan Daily, these articles will also be compiled into a book. The Provincial Committee believes that leading cadres at all levels should make timely summary of experience and writing articles into a habit and system, and regard this work as an aspect of work leap forward and an important method to improve their leadership ability.

    提高领导干部的重要方法
    云南开展写千篇文章运动总结大跃进中实践经验
    据新华社讯　中共云南省委决定在全省县委书记以上的各级领导干部中，开展一个以总结大跃进中实践经验为中心的写作千篇文章运动。
    省委指出：这些文章的内容，可以反映思想工作和工业、农业、文化教育、财经贸易等各个方面的情况。由各级领导干部选择自己在大跃进中感受最深、体会最多的方面或问题作为主题。文章既不要局限于就事论事，也不要空发议论，力求材料与观念的统一。省委认为：理论来自于实践，又要服务于实践；必需打破干部中对理论的神秘观念或糊涂观念，要通过实际工作来讲辩证法。凡是能够说明和解决实际问题、并符合于客观规律的认识，就是理论。要破除迷信，提倡思想解放，只要方向正确，一切为着实现总路线，就应放开胆量，加以发挥，文章也就可以有自己的语言，生动活泼。
    省委要求：书记要亲自动手，党委和宣传部门应加以具体组织，保证在今后三个月内，按规定的数量，分批把文章写给省委。这些文章除由省委有选择地交给将出版的理论刊物和在云南日报上公开发表外，并将汇编成册。省委认为：各级领导干部要把及时总结经验、写作文章形成一种习惯和制度，把这项工作看作是工作跃进的一个方面，一个提高自己领导能力的重要方法。
