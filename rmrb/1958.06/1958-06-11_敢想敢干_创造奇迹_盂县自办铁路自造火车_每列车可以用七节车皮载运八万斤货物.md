    Daring to Think and Act, Creating Miracles
    Yu County Self-Manages Railway and Self-Manufactures Trains
    Each Train Can Use Seven Cars to Carry 80,000 Jin of Goods
    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, 10th dispatch) The nation's first county-run railway has successfully undergone a trial run. This is a bold and original undertaking led by Comrade Zhang Runhuai, Secretary of the Yu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province. This three-mile-long railway, from the Fifth and Fifth Iron Industry United Processing Factory outside Yu County to the Shidian Coking Plant, was test-run on June 6th.
    This railway uses pig iron produced by newly built small blast furnaces in the area. The rails were cast by the Iron Industry Processing Factory, recently formed by the union of handicraft cooperatives. They bought a used gasoline engine track maintenance car from the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, converted it into a locomotive, and manufactured their own cars for trial transport. They now plan to lay four railways totaling twenty-three kilometers between the county's major factories and mines this year.
    Yu County was originally a mountainous area with almost no industry. This year, it has established 307 factories and mines, leading to a sudden increase in freight volume. Each day, the newly built mines need to transport about 1,000 tons of ore to the factories, and the quantity of products shipped to other places is also very large. To complete such a large transportation task, it would be necessary to buy 400 cars, which is impossible. The Yu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party originally planned to use horse-drawn carts and handcarts for transportation. After calculation, this would not only require a lot of manpower and animal power, but also the county's roads would be completely blocked by vehicles. Therefore, the transportation problem became a major obstacle to the industrial development of Yu County.
    Comrade Zhang Runhuai, the County Committee Secretary responsible for leading industry, was so anxious that he could not sleep at night. He thought that if there were trains, the problem would be solved. So he convened the County Committee and put forward his idea: to build railways and manufacture trains with their own hands. After research, everyone agreed to give it a try. Comrade Zhang Runhuai was originally an agricultural labor model, only had primary school education, and had only ridden a train in his life, never understanding railway technology. However, he boldly surveyed the terrain, planned the route, and rushed to the Fifth and Fifth Iron Industry United Processing Factory to encourage the workers to boldly imitate the railway and cast iron rails using pig iron. The factory specially established a committee, and everyone studied together. The foundry workers made a rail model and cast the one-meter-long rails using molten iron. Subsequently, the County Committee mobilized more than 280 people (including government cadres) and completed all the roadbed, sleepers, and track laying for the first railway from the Iron Industry United Processing Factory to the Coking Plant within a few days. The track is as wide as a regular railway, but because the pig iron rails are relatively brittle, the sleepers are spaced closer together.
    On June 6th, they converted the track maintenance car bought from Taiyuan into a locomotive and conducted a trial run. The farmers along the route were very excited when they saw it. According to estimates after the trial run, each train can carry 80,000 jin of goods with seven cars. Five cars have already been rushed into production.
    The workers of the Iron Industry United Processing Factory are now designing and trial-producing steam boiler locomotives to increase traction. (Attached picture)

    敢想敢干　创造奇迹
    盂县自办铁路自造火车
    每列车可以用七节车皮载运八万斤货物
    本报太原10日电　全国第一条县办铁路已经试车成功。这是中共山西省盂县县委书记张润槐同志领导群众的大胆独创。这一条从盂县城外孙家庄五五铁业联合加工厂到石店炼焦厂的三里长的铁路，是在6月6日进行了试车的。
    这条铁路是用当地新建的小高炉出产的生铁，由新近从手工业社联合组成的铁业加工厂浇铸的铁轨铺设的，他们从太原铁路局买来一部废旧的汽油机压道车改装成机车，自己制造车皮进行试运。现在他们计划今年在县里几个主要厂矿之间铺设四条铁路，全长二十三公里。
    盂县是原来几乎没有什么工业的山区，今年已经办起了三百零七个厂矿，货物运量突增，每天各个新建采矿场要运送一千吨左右的矿石给工厂，运往外地的产品数量也很大。完成这样大的运输任务，需要买四百辆汽车，而这是作不到的。中共盂县县委原计划用马车和小手车运送，计算以后，不仅要有很多人力、畜力，而且县里的道路会全被车辆堵塞。因此，运输问题成了盂县工业发展中的很大障碍。
    负责领导工业的县委书记张润槐同志急得夜不成眠。他想，要是有火车，就解决问题。于是他召开了县委会，提出了自己的想法：自己动手办铁路、造火车。大家经过研究，同意试试看。张润槐同志本来是农业劳动模范，只念过小学，平生只坐过火车，从来不懂得铁路技术，但是他大胆地去踏看地形，规划线路，又赶到五五铁业联合加工厂去鼓动职工，大胆地仿照铁路的样子，用生铁浇铁轨。厂里专门成立了委员会，大家一起研究，翻砂工人制成了铁轨模型，用铁水浇铸了每段一公尺长的铁轨。接着，县委动员了二百八十多人
  （包括机关干部），在几天内就完成了从铁业联合加工厂到炼焦厂的第一条铁路的全部路基、枕木和铺轨工程。轨道和正规的铁路一样宽，只是因生铁铁轨较脆，枕木排得密些。
    6月6日，他们把从太原买来的压道车改装了火车头，进行试车，沿线农民看了后，群情振奋。根据试车后的估算，以后每列车可以载运八万斤货，用七节车皮。现在已经赶造了五节。
    现在铁业联合加工厂的职工们正在设计和试制蒸汽锅炉的火车头，以便加大牵引力。（附图片）
