To the Editor of People's Daily,

Since the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued a notice on collecting folk songs and ballads on April 20, we have now received approximately 15,000 songs. I participated in the selection and editing of folk songs and have read several thousand of them. I am extremely excited! I deeply understand the meaning of "a generation of poetic style." I finalized the draft of the folk song selection, and after finishing it, I couldn't help but write four lines:

With a momentum like rivers and seas, and a spirit like a rainbow,
The singing of the masses creates a poetic style of a generation.
Even Li Bai and Du Fu would be envious,
The leading figures are the workers and peasants.

My impression of these folk songs and ballads is that they are magnificent and colorful. When I say magnificent, it's not just about the bold statements and heroic feats of "holding the universe in our hands" and "commanding the river to climb the mountains," but also: "Thousands of dragons, tens of thousands of dragons, connecting head to tail to climb the peaks. Opening their mouths to spout the waters of the river, the sound of rushing water echoes throughout the mountains and fields." What a majestic scene!

When I say colorful, look, the construction of terraced fields makes "Venus" exclaim: "Ah, the terraced fields have been built to the South Heaven Gate!" What rich imagination!

There is so much more to say. I want to recommend a few to the readers of the People's Daily, so I am copying them for you now. Li Yaqun

Thousands of Dragons Tens of Thousands of Dragons
Thousands of dragons, tens of thousands of dragons,
Connecting head to tail to climb the peaks.
Opening their mouths to spout the waters of the river,
The sound of rushing water echoes throughout the mountains and fields.
Even in drought, we will have enough to eat,
We hold the universe in our hands.

Commune Members Are Even Fiercer Than Zhang Fei
At Changban Bridge, Zhang Fei roared,
Three loud roars caused the water to flow backward;
Commune members are even fiercer than Zhang Fei,
Commanding the river to climb the mountains.

Enough for the Sun to Shine for Three Days
Our commune has several thousand people,
With many people and great strength, we are bound to conquer nature,
Each person wiping away a drop of sweat,
It is enough for the sun to shine for three days!

Otherwise, the Old Man Will Frown
Don't think the old man is sixty-three,
I can handle any kind of work,
Call me for drought resistance at night,
Otherwise, the old man will frown.

Alarming the Heavenly Venus
The sound of hoeing rolls into the clouds,
Alarming the Heavenly Venus,
Parting the clouds to look down:
"Ah, the terraced fields have been built to the South Heaven Gate!"

The White Clouds Don't Want to Leave
The barren hills put on green clothes,
Becoming a beautiful maiden,
The white clouds don't want to leave when they see it,
Hovering around her all day long.

The Fields Are Full of the Sound of Flowing Water
After the rain, the green mountains are even greener,
Commune members go home to manage the water:
"This rain is so good,
The fields are full of the sound of flowing water."

Hard to Tell Heaven from Earth
The blue sky is impossible to see through,
The green rice fields have no end,
One piece connected to another,
Hard to tell heaven from earth.

Leap Forward Red Flag Flying in the Air
The leap forward red flag is flying in the air,
The Yangge drums are like waves.
The grain carts squeak,
Mighty and grand, crossing the bridge.

The Oriole Still Follows the Old Rules
In previous years, we waited for Qingming to plow the fields,
This year, we are busy transplanting rice seedlings at Qingming;
The oriole still follows the old rules,
Sleeping soundly in the mountains and not opening its mouth.

Swallows, Don't Fly to the Fields
Swallows, don't fly to the fields,
The fields are stationed with pest control teams;
If you fly there again,
I'm afraid there will be misunderstandings in the midst of busyness.

### 给人民日报读者  介绍几首四川民歌

    给人民日报读者
    介绍几首四川民歌
    中共四川省委宣传部副部长　李亚群
    编辑同志：
    中共四川省委于4月20日发出搜集民歌民谣的通知后，现在我们已经收到约一万五千多首。我参加了民歌的选编工作，读了好几千首民歌民谣。我兴奋极了！深切地体会到“一代诗风”的含义。民歌选集是由我订稿的，订稿后不禁写了四句：
    势如江海气如虹，万众歌声一代风。
    羡煞谪仙惊杜老，风流人物数工农。
    这些民歌民谣给我的印象是：气势磅礴，色彩缤纷。我说气势磅礴，其中不单是有“乾坤掌在人手中”、“命令江水上山头”的豪语和壮举，而且：“千条龙，万条龙，首尾衔接上高峰。张口喷出江海水，满山遍野响淙淙。”这又是多么雄伟的画面！
    我说色彩缤纷，你看，修造梯田，使得“太白星”惊叫：“啊，梯田修上了南天门！”这又是多么丰富的想像力！
    诸如此类，真是说不完。我要推荐几首给人民日报的读者，现在抄写给你们。　李亚群
    千条龙　万条龙千条龙，万条龙，首尾衔接上高峰。张口喷出江海水，满山遍野响淙淙。天干也要吃饱饭，乾坤掌在人手中。
    社员更比张飞猛长板桥头张飞吼，大吼三声水倒流；社员更比张飞猛，命令江水上山头。
    也够太阳晒三天社里人口好几千，人多力大定胜天，每人挥下一滴汗，也够太阳晒三天！
    不然老汉把脸翻别看老汉六十三，样样活儿吃得干，晚上抗旱要叫我，不然老汉把脸翻。
    惊动天上太白星一阵锄声卷入云，惊动天上太白星，拨开云头往下看：“啊，梯田修上了南天门！”
    白云看见不想走荒山穿起绿衣裳，变成一个美姑娘，白云看见不想走，整天盘绕在身旁。
    田野一遍流水声雨后青山青更青，社员整水回家门：“这场大雨下得好田野一遍流水声。”
    难分天上与人间蓝蓝天空望不穿，绿绿秧田不见边，一片一片连一片，难分天上与人间。
    跃进红旗空中飘跃进红旗空中飘，秧歌锣鼓像浪潮。运粮车儿叽叽叫，浩浩荡荡过了桥。
    阳雀还守老规矩往年耕田等清明，今年清明忙插秧；阳雀还守老规矩，死睡山林不开腔。
    燕儿莫往田间飞燕儿莫往田间飞，田间驻有除害队；你若再往那里飞，恐怕忙中有误会。
