　　Dyeing Silk Without Pigments

    Liang Shukai, a young technician at the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory, successfully dyed silk into eighteen colors, including coffee and sky blue, in April this year by using the chemical components of the silk fiber itself in conjunction with metal salts, without using any pigments. This is something not found in books and that many experts had not considered. He had heard that it was possible to dye wool without pigments. He thought: Silk is also an animal fiber, why not give it a try? With the support of the leadership, he persisted in experimenting and finally made a valuable contribution to the science and technology of silk dyeing. Using this method to dye silk can reduce costs by 99% compared to using dyes.

    Wang Baoshu, a twenty-three-year-old young laboratory technician at the Tianjin Lihe Textile Company, upon hearing about Liang Shukai's creation of dyeing silk without pigments, thought: If Liang Shukai can dye silk without pigments, why can't I try dyeing cotton cloth without pigments? He began experimenting that very evening after hearing the news. After several attempts that did not produce any color, he did not lose heart. He continued to study and experiment. From April 18th to May 9th, he spent his spare time experimenting ninety-six times and finally succeeded in developing a method of dyeing cotton using only an intermediate of one pigment, called a base powder, to produce more than twenty colors, including yellow, green, purple, and brown. The color fastness reached the standards of high-grade dyes. This victory encouraged him to continue his research. According to technical books, aniline can only dye black cloth. However, Wang Baoshu broke this superstition and on May 21st, he used domestically produced aniline to dye seven new colors, including red, pink, apricot yellow, and purple. The color fastness is equivalent to that of indanthrene cloth.

    The daring and proactive spirit of Liang Shukai and Wang Baoshu has been encouraged and supported by factory leaders, experts, workers, and relevant departments. (Li Ping)

### 染丝绸不用颜料

　　染丝绸不用颜料
    天津织染厂青年技术员梁树楷，今年4月份用丝绸纤维本身的化学成份和金属盐偶合的方法，不用颜料，染出了咖啡色、天蓝色等十八种颜色的丝绸。这是书本上找不到、许多专家都没有想过的事情。他曾听人说过，染羊毛不用颜料可以染出色来。他想：丝也是动物纤维，为什么不能试试看呢？在领导的支持下，坚持不懈地进行了试验，终于为丝绸染色的科学技术，做出了有价值的贡献。采用这种方法染丝绸，比用染料可以降低成本99％。
    天津市利和织物公司二十三岁的青年化验员汪宝树，听到梁树楷不用颜料染丝绸的创造以后，心想：梁树楷不用颜料能染丝绸，我为什么不可以试一下不用颜料染棉布呢？在听到消息后的当天晚上就进行试验。试验了几次，没有染出颜色来；但他不灰心，又研究试验，从4月18日到5月9日，他利用业余时间试验了九十六次，终于研究成功了只用一种颜料的中间体——打底粉，染出了黄、绿、紫、棕等二十多种颜色，而且颜色的坚牢度达到高级染料的标准。这一次的胜利，鼓舞着他继续钻研，据技术书籍上记载，安尼林只能染黑布。但是汪宝树破除了这个迷信，在5月21日，他用国产的安尼林染出红、粉红、杏黄、紫等七种新颜色，颜色的坚牢度相当于阴丹士林布。
    梁树楷、汪宝树敢想敢做的精神，曾得到工厂领导上、专家、工人和有关部门的鼓励和支持。（李萍）
