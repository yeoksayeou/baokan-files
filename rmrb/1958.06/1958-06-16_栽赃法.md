    A Note

    After the Soviet government agreed to hold a meeting of experts in Geneva on July 1 to study methods for detecting nuclear explosions, the U.S. State Department began making excuses, claiming that the Soviet memorandum contained "inaccurate descriptions" of certain points already agreed upon by both sides.

    What exactly were these points that were "inaccurately described"? The U.S. side believes that one point is the composition of the two expert groups, with the U.S. demanding the right to allow experts from countries other than the U.S., Britain, and France to participate in the meeting if necessary. The other point is the task of the meeting, with the U.S. advocating that it should only be responsible for studying the technical issues of detecting nuclear tests without affecting each side's respective attitudes. This is contrary to what the Soviet memorandum hoped for, which would cause the expert meeting to be bogged down in disputes and unable to reach an agreement on the issue of stopping nuclear tests, which the people of the world urgently desire.

    In fact, the U.S. government's attitude "accurately" demonstrates to the world that the U.S. is deliberately creating obstacles for technical negotiations on stopping nuclear tests, seeking excuses to continue nuclear tests, and attempting to shift the responsibility for failing to reach an agreement onto the Soviet Union. Of course, the clumsy "frame-up" of the American atomic maniacs cannot deceive anyone.

    栽赃法
    在苏联政府同意于7月1日在日内瓦举行研究发现核爆炸方法的专家会议以后，美国国务院又在制造借口，说什么苏联的备忘录对双方已经商定的某些点“说明得不确切”。
    究竟哪些点“说明得不确切”呢？美国方面认为，一点是两个专家组的组成问题，美国要求保留在必要情况下让美英法以外的其他国家专家参加会议的权利；另一点是会议的任务问题，美国主张只负责研究发现核试验的技术问题而不影响任何一方各自的态度，也就是同苏联备忘录中所希望的相反，使这个专家会议争吵不休，而不能就世界人民所迫切希望的停止核试验问题达成协议。
    其实，美国政府的这种态度，倒是向全世界非常“确切”地说明了这一点，那就是美国存心为停止核试验的技术谈判制造障碍，为坚持核试验寻找借口，并妄图把不能达成协议的责任推到苏联身上。当然，美国原子狂人的这种拙劣的“栽赃法”是骗不了任何人的。
