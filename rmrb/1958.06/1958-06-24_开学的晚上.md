    The Evening of the School Opening
    Li Keng

    In the twilight, I finished hauling the last two loads of rotten mud for the flower and vegetable plots and came back from work. Without even washing my face, I hurriedly drank three bowls of barley porridge, stuffed the temporary textbook into my pocket, and rushed towards Hedong. In the distance, muffled thunder rumbled a few times; the sky was low and heavy, and the road was very dark.

    As soon as I entered the room that used to be the agricultural society's accounting office, the twenty-odd young people sitting around two square tables suddenly stood up and greeted me warmly, "Hello, teacher!" I suddenly felt a rush of heat on my face and immediately replied, "Hello, comrades—students!" From now on, I will be a farmer by day and a teacher by night.

    Just as they opened their textbooks, I looked around at my students. Here were Little Zhu, who taught me work songs in the fields; Guanglin, who called me "Big Watermelon" (I once sang this Northeast folk song for them); Little Yuan, who deliberately wrote my name as "Mud Pit"... They were all my teachers during the day, carefully teaching me how to dig mud, carry soil, tie cotton stalks, tread waterwheels... And now, they were all sitting upright, eyes wide open, looking at me. Their hands and faces still had mud on them. They were surprisingly quiet, even a little restrained, but their eyes fully revealed the excitement in their hearts—from now on, they were middle school students!

    Our small village of only two hundred households had actually established an agricultural middle school, and tonight was the first class. Four of us transferred cadres were in charge of teaching. Half a month ago, Xinghua County only had two ordinary middle schools, but in just a few days, our township alone established nine agricultural middle schools!

    The school's equipment was very simple. Needless to say, there was no auditorium, no sports field, no education affairs office… there wasn't even a proper classroom. Our middle school had only one small room. A portrait of Chairman Mao was hung on the newly whitewashed wall, along with a paper national flag and an eye-catching slogan: "Leap Forward in Production and Learning, Double Harvest in Grain and Culture." Next to it was a small, paint-peeled blackboard, and two kerosene lamps hung from the roof beams. The square tables and benches in front of me were all brought by the students themselves.

    The lesson began. The students didn't understand Mandarin very well, so I tried to speak more slowly. The first lesson I taught was: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." -- I told the story of a new commune member who overcame various difficulties and created a three-purpose seeder. When I talked about him doing research and experiments late into the night and being obstructed by his mother, suddenly, a low voice came from behind me: "Hmm, his mother is wrong!" The students couldn't help but burst into laughter. I turned around and found that there were many "auditors" standing at the "classroom" door, including old grandfathers, old grandmothers, middle-aged farmers, and young pioneers. The person who had just interjected was a grandmother with graying temples. Little Zhu in front of me introduced her to me in a low voice: She is Shen Ruilong's mother. Ah, I immediately remembered that Shen Ruilong had written in his entrance exam composition a touching passage about his father being brutally beaten by the landlord in the past and his mother holding him and crying bitterly. I asked her, "Grandma, why did you come to class too?" She smiled: "Hmm, to see Ruilong in class and listen to your lecture." I said, "Ruilong is in agricultural middle school now, is that good?" "Good! It's an honor!" she replied excitedly: "Our family has a shortage of labor. Ruilong went home to work in production before he finished primary school by a year. Now that there is an agricultural middle school, he passed the exam and became a middle school student, it's really an honor!" She said the words "honor" twice. The villagers standing next to her also chimed in and said, "That's right, it's an honor! Who would have dared to think about going to middle school back then!" These "auditors'" interjections made the atmosphere in the classroom lively.

    We had two Chinese lessons tonight. After only half of the first lesson, the light of lightning flashed across the dark night sky, and a series of thunderclaps drew everyone's attention to the outside of the window. It was about to rain heavily. I knew that everyone had not brought rain hats or ponchos. "What to do?" I asked for everyone's opinions. "It doesn't matter, you go on with the lecture, learning is important!" they replied in unison. The only female student among them—seventeen-year-old Zhou Anfen—looked anxiously out the window and muttered softly, "My home is in Hexi, and I have to walk half a mile!" But two young men immediately responded, "It doesn't matter, I'll take you home."

    Sure enough, the torrential rain poured down, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Rainwater splashed in through the cracks in the windows. The students moved the tables forward again and again. In this room with good "ventilation equipment," the kerosene lamps flickered in the wind, and red light danced on the students' faces. But their emotions were always so focused and so full. At this time, I found that I was not as nervous as I was when the class first started. I felt particularly comfortable in my heart, and I explained the text with particular enthusiasm.

    开学的晚上
    黎铿
    暮色苍茫中，我给花草田挑完最后两担烂泥收工回来，脸也没洗，匆匆地喝了三碗元麦粥，把临时课本揣在口袋里，便赶忙往河东跑去。远处，打了几声闷雷；天，压得低低的，路也很黑。
    我刚一走进原是农业社会计室的房间，围坐在两张方桌旁的二十多个小伙子，倏的一下站起来，热情地向我喊道：“老师好！”我脸上忽然感到一阵热，立刻回答：“同志们——同学们好！”从现在起，我将白天是农民，晚上当教师了。
    就在他们把课本打开的瞬间，我环视了我的学生们。这里有在田里教我打号子的小祝、见了我就叫我“大西瓜”（我曾给他们唱过这支东北民歌）的广林、把我的名字故意写成“泥坑”的小袁……他们，白天都是我的老师，细心地教给我挖泥、挑土、捆棉杆、踩水车……，现在呢，一个个都端端正正地坐着，睁大眼睛看着我。他们的手上脸上还有泥巴。他们出奇地安静，甚至有些拘束，但他们的眼神里，充分流露出心底的兴奋——从现在起，他们当上中学生了！
    我们这仅有两百来户的小庄子，居然成立了农业中学，今晚正式上课。由我们四个下放干部包教。半个月前，兴化县才只有两所普通中学，但，经过几天功夫，光我们一个乡，就一下子成立了九所农业中学了！
    学校的设备十分简单。不用说，这里还没有礼堂，没有球场，没有教务处……甚至没有正规的课堂。我们的中学，总共就只有一个不大的房间。新刷的白墙上挂着毛主席的画像，纸制的国旗，一条醒目的标语：“生产、学习齐跃进，粮食、文化两丰收”。旁边挂着一块褪了漆的小黑板，屋梁上吊着两盏煤油灯，在我面前的两张方桌和板凳，全是学生们自己带来的。
    开始讲课了。学生们不太懂普通话，我尽量说得慢一些。我讲的第一课是：“天下无难事，只怕有心人。”——写一个新社员战胜了种种困难，创造了三用播种机的经过。讲到他每天深夜做研究试验，受到母亲的阻挠时，忽然，从我背后传来了低低的一声：“唔，他妈妈不对！”学生们忍不住一阵哄笑。我转过头去，发现“教室”门口站了好些个“旁听生”，有老爹爹、老奶奶，有中年农民，还有红领巾。刚才插嘴的，是一个鬓发斑白的奶奶。在我面前的小祝轻声地给我介绍：她是沈瑞龙的母亲。呵，我马上想起沈瑞龙在入学考试的作文中，写他父亲过去遭到地主的毒打、他母亲抱着他痛哭那感人的一段。我问她：“老奶奶，怎么你也来上课了？”她笑了：“唔，来看瑞龙上课，听你讲课。”我说：“瑞龙上农业中学了，好不好？”“好哇！光荣啊！”她兴奋地回答：“我们家劳动力不足，瑞龙小学还差一年没念完，就回家生产了，现在有了农业中学，他考上了，当了中学生，真是光荣啊！”“光荣”这两个字她说了两遍。站在她身旁的老乡们也都插嘴说：“对啊，光荣啊！我们那时候谁敢想进中学！”这些“旁听生”的插话使课堂的气氛活跃了。
    今晚连上两节语文课。才上了一半，闪电的光亮划破了漆黑的夜空，一连几声霹雷把大家的视线都引向窗外。马上要下大雨了。我知道大家都没带斗笠或雨蓬来。“怎么办？”我征求大家的意见。“不要紧，你讲下去，学习重要啊！”他们异口同声地回答。其中唯一的一个女同学——十七岁的周安芬，她用焦虑的目光看着窗外，轻轻地嘀咕了一句：“我家在河西，要走一里地呢！”但立刻有两个小伙子答了腔：“没关系，我送你回去。”
    果然暴雨哗哗地倒下来，天骤然变冷了。雨水透过窗户的缝隙往里泼打。学生们把桌子往前移动了一次又一次。在这有着良好的“通风设备”的房间里，煤油灯被风吹得一眨一眨的，红光在学生们的脸上跳动着。但他们的情绪却始终那么贯注，那么饱满。这时候，我发觉我也不像刚上课时那么紧张了。我心里显得特别舒畅，课文也讲解得特别有劲儿了。
