    This year, 31 combine harvesters participated in the wheat harvest. Thanks to the workers' all-out efforts and striving for excellence, work efficiency has been unprecedentedly improved, with many machines exceeding their work quotas by more than double during the summer harvest.
    Processed wheat is continuously bagged at the field, ready to be handed over to the state.
    On the farm's vast threshing grounds, workers are seizing the time to winnow the wheat.

    今年有三十一台联合收割机参加麦收。由于工人们鼓足干劲，力争上游，工作效率空前提高，许多机器在夏收中超过了工作定额的一倍。
    在场上加工好的麦子陆续装袋，准备上缴国家。
    在农场广大的晒场上，工人们正在抓紧扬场。
