The East Wind Brings Timely Rain
"Living Luban" Creates Deep-Plowing Plow
(Our report) According to the Shaanxi Daily: Just as a great upsurge in deep plowing land is underway in rural Shaanxi, the East Wind has brought timely rain. "Living Luban" Liu Hengjie has created a deep plowing tool—a double-moldboard single-row deep-plowing plow.

This plow is modified from a double-wheeled double-moldboard plow. One person and two head of livestock can plow 3.2 mu of land in one day and two half-days of work. This is 12 times faster than using an iron shovel to turn the soil. It can plow to a depth of one chi to one chi two cun, the same depth as generally achieved with an iron shovel. The pulling force is also one-third lighter than the original plow.

When the summer crops in the Luo Liu Agricultural Cooperative of Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, had just entered the field, Liu Hengjie pondered how to improve the tools for deep plowing land. He thought that although using an iron shovel to turn the soil was simple, convenient, and of high quality, one person could only turn more than two fen of land per day, which was too inefficient. Therefore, he tried to modify the double-wheeled double-moldboard plow. He removed parts such as the furrow wheel, right plowshare, drawbar, and drawbeam of the double-moldboard plow, and installed a single-moldboard plow that could plow four cun deep on the left plow beam, seven cun away from the original left plow point, in a straight line. As a result, this deep-plowing plow was successfully created in two days, and the test results were very good.

### 东风送来及时雨  “活鲁班”制成深翻犁

    东风送来及时雨
    “活鲁班”制成深翻犁
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：正当陕西农村中大闹深翻土地运动的时候，东风送来及时雨，“活鲁班”刘恒杰创造了一种深翻土地的工具——双铧单行深翻犁。
    这种犁是用双轮双铧犁改装成的。一天两晌一个人、两头牲畜可耕地三亩二分，比人用铁锨翻地快十二倍，可耕一尺至一尺二寸深，和一般用铁锨翻地深度一样。拉力也比原来的轻三分之一。
    当渭南县双王乡罗刘农业社的夏田作物刚一上场，刘恒杰就苦苦思索如何改进深翻土地的工具。他想铁锨翻地虽然简单便利、质量很高，但是一个人一天只能翻二分多地，效率太低。因此，他就试用双轮双铧犁改装。把双铧犁原来的沟轮、右犁铧、牵引杆、牵引梁等零件卸掉，在左犁梁上安装一个可耕四寸深的单铧犁，和后面原来的左犁尖相距七寸，成一直线。结果用了两天时间这部深翻犁创造成功了，经过试验效果很好。
