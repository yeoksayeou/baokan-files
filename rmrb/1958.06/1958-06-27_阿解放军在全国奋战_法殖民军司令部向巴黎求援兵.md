Xinhua News Agency, June 25th, Algiers: According to an announcement from the headquarters of the French colonial army stationed in Algeria, the Algerian National Liberation Army and the French army continue to engage in fierce battles throughout Algeria.

A strong unit of the Algerian National Liberation Army clashed with the French army south of Lamoriciere yesterday. The French army had to send air force reinforcements.

Over the past weekend, Algerian patriots have been very active. They attacked railways and other French military transportation lines throughout the country.

Prior to this, on the evening of the 21st, the Algerian National Liberation Army also attacked Menerville, about forty-five miles east of Algiers, successfully breaking into the city. This was the second time in a week that the Algerian people's forces had attacked the town.

The severely battered French colonial army had to resort to the air force. In the past week, the French air force has carried out 2,090 combat flights. The fighting was particularly fierce in the provinces of Kabylia, Aumale, and Constantine.

Due to heavy casualties, the French colonial army headquarters in Algeria has had to request reinforcements from Paris in order to continue the war against the Algerian people.

Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, Algiers: On the evening of June 24th, the Algerian National Liberation Army ambushed a unit of the French colonial army near Tablat. The French army suffered seventeen casualties, and two more were "missing."

In the Kabylia mountains, the Algerian National Liberation Army and the French army have been engaged in fierce battles for days. In the intense fighting, a French helicopter and a fighter plane collided, resulting in the deaths of eleven French military personnel. At the same time, the French colonial authorities have intensified their bloody suppression of Algerian patriots. Yesterday, two more leaders of the Algerian national movement, Youssef Saadi and Hamdi Omer, were sentenced to death by the French military tribunal in Algiers.

    阿解放军在全国奋战
    法殖民军司令部向巴黎求援兵
    新华社25日讯　阿尔及尔消息：据驻阿尔及利亚法国殖民军司令部宣布，在阿尔及利亚全国各地，阿尔及利亚民族解放军和法军继续在激烈战斗。
    一支强大的阿尔及利亚民族解放军部队昨天在拉莫里济埃以南同法军发生冲突。法军不得不出动空军增援。
    在上周周末，阿尔及利亚爱国者非常活跃。他们在全国各地向铁路及法军的其他运输线进行了攻击。
    在这以前，阿尔及利亚民族解放军还在21日晚上进攻了阿尔及尔以东约四十五英里的梅内尔维尔，成功地突入市内。这次是阿尔及利亚人民的部队在一周之内第二次进攻这个市镇。
    受到严重打击的法国殖民军不得不求助于空军。在过去一个星期里，法国空军就进行了两千零九十次战斗飞行。在卡比利亚、阿兰和君士坦丁等省，战斗尤其激烈。
    由于伤亡惨重，法国驻阿尔及利亚殖民军司令部已经不得不向巴黎方面要求增援部队，以便继续进行反对阿尔及利亚人民的战争。
    据新华社26日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军24日晚上在塔卜拉特附近使一支法国殖民军部队中了埋伏。法军伤亡十七人，还有二人“失踪”。
    在卡比利亚山区，阿尔及利亚民族解放军和法军连日激战。在紧张的战斗中，法军方面的一架直升飞机和一架战斗机互撞，造成十一个法国军事人员的死亡。与此同时，法国殖民当局加紧了对阿尔及利亚爱国者的血腥镇压。昨天又有两个阿尔及利亚民族运动领袖被阿尔及尔法国军事法庭判处了死刑，他们是：优素福·萨迪和汉姆迪·欧默尔。
