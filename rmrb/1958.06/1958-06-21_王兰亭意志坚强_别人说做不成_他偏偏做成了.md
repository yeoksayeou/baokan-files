    Wang Lanting Has a Strong Will; He Succeeded Where Others Said It Couldn't Be Done
    Wang Lanting, a fitter at the state-owned Nanjing Radio Factory, with his strong will, broke down superstitions and obstacles and recently improved a method of processing parts, which can save 37 tons of steel annually, eliminate more than a dozen processes, and save 138 labor units per month.
    In the process of this improvement, Wang Lanting encountered resistance from engineering and technical personnel three times. One evening, he remembered that the factory had a material pulling machine that could roll thick iron ingots into thin wires. "Could this method also be used to make 'board boots'?" He discussed this idea with an engineer, but the engineer did not support it, saying, "In the past, someone wanted to use a punch press to make them, but it was not successful." Wang Lanting thought, can't something that wasn't successful in the past be successful today? He mustered his courage and decided to give it a try. He designed a sketch of a mold and showed it to the workshop process group, but the process group technician was not enthusiastic, thinking that the hope was not great. The second setback did not deter Wang Lanting. He used his Sunday time to find some materials, draw his own drawings, scribe lines, drill holes, and then asked the process section mold management group to entrust the tool workshop to make it. However, the process section mold group poured cold water on him again, saying, "We guarantee 100% that it will not succeed." Wang Lanting, who has a strong will, was not shaken by this, and he decided to make the mold himself. With the help of the workers, he used the time after his evening shift every day to make the mold. After the factory leaders learned about it, they gave him great support and encouragement, and with the help of the chief engineer to modify it, he finally succeeded in test rolling.

### 王兰亭意志坚强  别人说做不成　他偏偏做成了

    王兰亭意志坚强
    别人说做不成　他偏偏做成了
    国营南京有线电厂钳工王兰亭以坚强的意志破除迷信和障碍，最近改进一项加工零件的方法，全年可以节约三十七吨钢，而且取消了十几道工序，每月可以节约一百三十八个劳动力。
    王兰亭在这项改进的过程中，曾经三次遇到工程技术人员的阻挠。一天晚上，他想起厂里有一部拉料机，能把粗的铁元轧成细的铁丝，“板靴能不能也用这个方法制造呢？”他把这意见和一位工程师商量，但是工程师并不支持，还说：“过去有人想改用冲床制，结果没有成功”。王兰亭想，过去不成功的事，难道今天就不能做成功吗？他鼓起勇气，决定试一试。他设计了一个模具草图，让车间工艺组看，但工艺组技术员也不热心，认为希望不大。第二次挫折并没有吓退王兰亭。他利用星期天的时间，找了块材料，自己画图、划线、钻孔，然后请工艺科模具管理组委托工具车间做，但是工艺科模具组又当头泼了一盆冷水，说：“保证百分之百的不成功”。有着坚强意志的王兰亭，并不因此动摇，他决定自己做模子。他在工人们的帮助下，利用每天晚班后的时间把模具做好了。厂领导知道以后，给予他极大的支持和鼓励，加上总工程师帮助他修改，最后终于试轧成功。
