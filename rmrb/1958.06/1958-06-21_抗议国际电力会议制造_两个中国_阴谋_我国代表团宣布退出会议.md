Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 20th: The Chinese delegation attending the International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems (CIGRE) issued a statement at the plenary session on June 14th, strongly protesting the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" at the conference and announcing the withdrawal of the Chinese delegation from the conference.

The International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems opened in Paris on June 4th. The International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems had long recognized the National Committee of the People's Republic of China as a participant in the organization. The organization stipulates that a country can only have one National Committee. However, at this conference, the conference host violated the charter and illegally invited members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to participate in the conference and admitted them as members. At the plenary session on the 14th, when the Chinese delegation once again demanded that the conference host respect the charter and expel the Chiang gang elements, the conference host attempted to prevent the Chinese delegation from speaking and put to a vote the motion proposed by the conspirators to expel the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

Li Yan, head of the Chinese delegation, stated at the meeting: The National Committee of the People's Republic of China participating in the International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems is the only legitimate national organization. The International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems, while recognizing the Chinese National Committee, actually allows Chiang Kai-shek elements to participate in the conference, which is completely illegal. The Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is spurned by the Chinese people, has no right to attend the conference in any capacity.

    抗议国际电力会议制造“两个中国”阴谋
    我国代表团宣布退出会议
    据新华社20日讯　巴黎消息：出席国际大电力系统会议的中国代表团在6月14日的全体会议上发表声明，严正抗议会议上制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且宣布中国代表团退出会议。
    国际大电力系统会议这次会议是6月4日在巴黎开幕的。国际大电力系统会议早已承认参加这一组织的中华人民共和国国家委员会。这个组织规定一个国家只能有一个国家委员会。但是，在这次会议中，会议主持人竟违背会章，非法邀请台湾蒋介石集团分子参加会议，并且吸收其为会员。在14日大会全体会议上，当中国代表团再次要求会议主持人尊重会章，驱逐蒋帮分子时，会议主持人竟然企图阻止中国代表发言，并且将阴谋分子在会上提出的要求驱逐中华人民共和国代表团的动议交付表决。
    中国代表团团长李岩在会议上声明：中华人民共和国参加国际大电力系统会议的国家委员会是中国唯一合法的全国性组织，国际大电力系统会议在承认中国国家委员会的同时而竟然又容许蒋介石分子参加会议，这是完全非法的，被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石集团根本没有任何权利以任何名义出席会议。
