    Blatant Lies
    In a speech on June 27th, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke said that in the Middle East, Indonesia, and the Far East, high-speed military mobility is "essential if the United States hopes to take effective action to help a friend under siege."
    Burke's remarks completely expose the U.S. imperialism's fear of the easing of international tensions today, as well as its ambition to instigate aggressive conspiracies in Asia and Africa. However, to say that the United States is adopting high-speed military mobility to "help a friend under siege" is a monstrous lie. People all over the world can see clearly the questions of who is besieging and who is being besieged. In the Middle East, the United States and Britain and their vassal states are "besieging" the Lebanese people who are unwilling to sell out their national independence and sovereignty. In Southeast Asia, the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization it controls have long colluded with Indonesian rebels to "besiege" the Indonesian people who are defending national independence and national unity. This fact once again proves that in the "political dictionary" of U.S. imperialism, every word must be interpreted in reverse.

### 露骨的谎言

    露骨的谎言
    美国海军作战参谋长阿莱·伯克海军上将，于6月27日发表的一次讲话中，说在中东、印度尼西亚和远东这些地区，高速度的军事机动性是“必不可少的，如果美国希望采取有效行动来帮助一个遭到围攻的朋友的话”。
    伯克的这番话完全暴露了今天美帝国主义害怕国际紧张局势的缓和，以及它企图在亚非地区策动侵略阴谋的野心。但是，说美国采取高速度的军事机动性是为了“帮助一个遭到围攻的朋友”，却是弥天大谎。谁在围攻和围攻谁这两个问题，全世界人民都看得一清二楚。在中东，美国和英国及其仆从国家正在“围攻”不愿出卖民族独立和主权的黎巴嫩人民。在东南亚，美国和它控制的东南亚条约组织早就勾结印度尼西亚叛乱分子向为保卫民族独立和国家统一的印度尼西亚人民进行“围攻”。这一事实再次证明：在美帝国主义的“政治辞典”中，每个词儿都须用反面话来解释。
