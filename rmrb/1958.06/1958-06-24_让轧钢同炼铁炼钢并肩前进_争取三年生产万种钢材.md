Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd—After the great leap forward in iron and steelmaking, how can steel rolling catch up quickly? The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry foresaw this important issue and recently convened a national steel rolling production promotion meeting in Shanghai.

The meeting held that steel rolling should catch up at the fastest speed and advance shoulder to shoulder with iron and steelmaking. It is necessary to rapidly expand the output and variety of steel, strive to produce tens of thousands of kinds of steel in China within three years, and especially to rapidly expand the varieties urgently needed for national construction, such as seamless steel pipes, steel plates, steel rails, and wire rods. Through adding a large number of new equipment and tapping the potential of existing factories, the output of seamless steel pipes, medium and heavy plates, thin plates, and heavy steel rails in China should have a significant increase next year.

The meeting pointed out that some regions have not paid enough attention to the development of steel rolling production; some regions have considered developing steel rolling, but only considered developing ordinary steel of square, round, and flat shapes. People have fears about varieties such as seamless steel pipes, steel plates, and steel rails, thinking that the technology is complex and they do not know how; they are superstitious about rolling mills only being manufactured with large equipment, and the equipment conditions of local industries are poor, making it difficult to build. Representatives attending the meeting exchanged experiences and discussed, criticizing these mysterious concepts. They visited the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant's major innovation of processing large frames for thin plate machines with small machine tools, and visited the Shanghai Yongxin Hardware Factory's use of indigenous methods to roll seamless steel pipes, which greatly inspired and encouraged them, and dispelled superstition.

The meeting required all regions to conduct an overall plan for the development of steel rolling in their regions under the unified leadership of the central government. The meeting especially studied the issue of vigorously developing relatively special varieties such as seamless steel pipes, steel plates, and steel rails, and put forward the scale of development.

The key to developing steel rolling production and expanding varieties is manufacturing rolling mills. The meeting held that this is a very urgent task, and the principle of solving it is to rely on the combination of the machinery industry and the steel industry relying on their own efforts. All regions should organize the machine repair forces of the machinery industry and non-machinery industry departments for large-scale collaboration, just as Shanghai is currently rushing to manufacture equipment for the great development of the East China steel industry. The machine repair force of the steel industry itself is a force that cannot be ignored and can manufacture rolling mills and electric motors. Representatives of Anshan Iron and Steel Company stated that they can squeeze out machine repair forces to manufacture equipment for various regions.

Fully tapping the potential of existing factories is also an important aspect of increasing steel production. Existing factories should organize appraisal competitions, compare with advanced factories and catch up with advanced factories; they should try to adopt all new technologies in the world, such as economical steel, cold-formed steel, extruded steel, and periodic section steel. Anshan Iron and Steel Company's replacement of the forging steel rolls of the roughing mill with ductile iron rolls is very worthy of promotion throughout the country.

### 让轧钢同炼铁炼钢并肩前进  争取三年生产万种钢材

    让轧钢同炼铁炼钢并肩前进
    争取三年生产万种钢材
    新华社上海23日电  炼铁、炼钢跃进以后，轧钢如何赶快跟上去？冶金工业部预见到这个重大问题，最近在上海召开了全国轧钢生产促进会议。
    会议认为，轧钢应该用最快的速度跟上去，同炼铁、炼钢并肩前进。要迅速扩大钢材的产量和品种，争取三年内我国能够生产上万种钢材，特别要迅速扩大无缝钢管、钢板、钢轨、线材等几类国家建设迫切需要的品种。通过增添大量的新设备和原有工厂挖潜力，要使我国无缝钢管、中厚钢板、薄板和重型钢轨的产量明年有一个很大的增长。
    会议指出，目前有些地区对发展轧钢生产，还未引起足够的重视；有些地区也考虑到发展轧钢，但只考虑到要发展一些方、圆、扁形状的普通钢材。人们对无缝钢管、钢板、钢轨等品种存在有畏惧情绪，认为技术复杂，自己不会；迷信轧钢机只有大设备才能制造，地方工业的设备条件差，造起来很困难。参加会议的代表通过交流经验和讨论，批判了这些神秘观念。他们参观了上海第三钢铁厂用小机床加工薄板机大机架的重大创造，参观了上海永鑫五金厂用土办法轧制无缝钢管，得到了很大的启发和鼓舞，破除了迷信。
    会议要求各地要在中央统一领导下，对本地区轧钢的发展进行全盘的规划。会议特别研究了大力发展无缝钢管、钢板、钢轨等比较特殊的品种的问题，提出了发展的规模。
    发展轧钢生产和扩大品种的关键问题是制造轧钢机。会议认为，这是一个很迫切的任务，解决的原则是依靠机械工业和钢铁工业自力更生相结合。各地应该像目前上海为华东钢铁工业大发展赶制设备那样，组织机械工业和非机械工业部门的机修力量进行大协作。钢铁工业本身的机修力量是一支不可忽视的力量，可以制造轧钢机和电动机。鞍钢的代表表示，他们可以挤出机修力量来为各地制造设备。
    现有工厂充分发挥潜力，也是增产钢材的重要环节。现有工厂要组织评比竞赛，互相比先进、赶先进；要尽量采用世界上一切新技术，如经济型钢、冷弯型钢、挤压钢材、周期断面钢材等。鞍钢用球墨铸铁轧辊代替初轧机的锻钢轧辊，很值得在全国推广。
