Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: The railway construction army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps will complete all the railway projects it is undertaking ahead of schedule.

The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has brought tremendous encouragement to the officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps fighting on the northern and southern lines. Construction units on all lines have broken through the original plans with overwhelming momentum, and the construction progress has been greatly accelerated. Judging from the current progress, the Baotou-Yinchuan section of the Baolan Railway, the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway, the Wuhan hub station, and the Bisezhai-Hekou line undertaken by the Railway Corps construction units can be completed or basically completed three to ten months ahead of schedule.

In the effort to complete the work ahead of schedule, the railway construction heroes of the Railway Corps have displayed soaring drive, and construction efficiency has been continuously improved, breaking the targets hundreds of times.

The officers and soldiers of the construction units on all lines have demonstrated the heroic spirit of not fearing any hardship or difficulty in the construction. They have launched a competition craze of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. New records are like waves of the spring tide, each higher than the last. In the water jetting and pile sinking project of the Huanghe (Yellow) River Bridge pier at Sanshenggong on the Baotou-Lanzhou line, the Jiaqiao (Bridge Building) unit, Du Linyou's work team, pioneered the record of sinking 36 meters of piles in eight hours. This record was then broken by Li Benfu's work team with a record of 48 meters. Soon, Zhang Shuangfa and Liang Jiwen's work team surpassed Li Benfu's work team with 56 meters; however, Du Linyou's work team, which pioneered the record, once again left other work teams behind with a new record of sinking 40.7 meters of piles in five hours and twenty minutes. The road construction heroes have displayed the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to create, and have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals and inventions. Not only striving for more and faster, but also achieving good and economical results. The Seventh Company of the bridge force solved the difficulty of insufficient technical strength by having one person learn multiple technologies and one person use multiple machines, which reduced construction costs. The Fourth Company, which was constructing the Nie Kou earth-borrowing site in Wuhan, increased the soil loading efficiency from an average of 2,880 cubic meters per day to 3,840 cubic meters per day while reducing five machines and thirty drivers and assistants, which enabled the project, originally scheduled to be completed in September this year, to be completed in June.

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: The Second Congress of Youth Socialist Construction Activists of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps was held in Beijing from the 14th to the 20th.

There were one hundred and five representatives of young activists attending this conference. Among them were Hu Yonghua, a young soldier who learned riveting in ten days and reached the third-grade technical level; Xie Pusheng, a young soldier known as "Little Zhuge," who designed five tools, including a "rail-spiking machine" and a "tamping machine," in the past two months; and Xu Jicheng, a member of the Communist Youth League who studied for three months to become a third-level carpenter and six months to become a fourth-level carpenter, and other advanced figures. They represent the tens of thousands of young activists who have emerged from the Railway Corps in recent years.

At the meeting, the leaders of the Railway Corps made a report on the general line and the future railway construction tasks, calling on the young soldiers to be the vanguards of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. Twenty-one representatives of young activists made reports on typical deeds at the meeting. The representatives exchanged experiences and discussed the instructions of the leaders. They unanimously expressed that they would resolutely implement the Party's general line, devote themselves to the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, and strive to build the motherland's railways in a faster, better, and more economical way.

During the meeting, Zhang Jiming, a representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, came to the meeting to congratulate and encourage the youth of the Railway Corps to take the lead in the technical revolution.

The conference elected seven young soldiers as representatives to attend the Second National Congress of Youth Socialist Construction Activists.

    铁道兵筑路英雄干劲冲天
    南北各铁路工程将提前建成
    第二次青年积极分子代表会在京举行
    据新华社21日讯  中国人民解放军铁道兵筑路大军所担负的各条铁路工程都将提前建成。
    党的社会主义建设总路线给奋战南北各线的铁道兵筑路部队官兵带来了巨大的鼓舞。各线施工部队都以排山倒海的气势突破原订计划，施工进度大大加快。从目前进展情况看来，铁道兵施工部队担负修建的包兰铁路包（头）银（川）段、南（平）福（州）铁路、武汉枢纽站、碧（色寨）河（口）线等工程，都可以比原计划提前三个月到十个月铺轨完成或基本完工。
    在争取提前完工中，铁道兵筑路英雄们发挥了冲天干劲，施工效率不断提高，成百次地突破了指标。
    各线筑路部队官兵在施工中表现了不怕任何艰苦困难的英雄气概。他们掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛热潮。新纪录如春朝一浪赶过一浪，一浪比一浪更高。在包（头）兰（州）线三盛公黄河大桥桥墩射水沉桩工程中，架桥部队杜林友工作班首创八小时沉桩三十六公尺的纪录。这个纪录接着被李本富工作班以四十八公尺的纪录突破，不久，张双发、梁吉文工作班，又以五十六公尺超过李本富工作班；可是，首创纪录的杜林友工作班又以五小时二十分沉桩四十点七公尺的新纪录重新把其他工作班抛在后面去了。筑路英雄们发挥了敢想、敢干、大胆创造的精神，提出了大批的合理化建议和发明创造。不仅争取多、快，而且做到了好、省。桥梁部队七连，用一人学会多种技术、一人使用多种机械的方法，解决了技术力量不足的困难，降低了施工成本。在武汉聂口取土场施工的四连，在减少了五台机械和三十名司机与助手的情况下，装土效率由每天平均二千八百八十公方提高到三千八百四十公方，使原来要在今年9月完成的工程，到6月就提前完成了。
    新华社21日讯  中国人民解放军铁道兵14日到20日在北京举行第二次青年社会主义建设积极分子代表大会。
    出席这次大会的有一百零五名青年积极分子代表。他们中有用十天时间学会铆工、并达到三等技术水平的青年战士胡永华，有在最近两个月设计出“钉道机”、“打夯机”等五件工具的、被称为“小诸葛”的青年士兵谢普生，有学习三个月成为三级木工、六个月成为四级木工的共青团员徐吉成等先进人物。他们代表着铁道兵部队几年来涌现出来的成千上万的青年积极分子。
    会上，铁道兵部队首长作了总路线和今后铁路修建任务的报告，号召青年战士们做技术革命和文化革命的尖兵。有二十一名青年积极分子代表在会上作了典型事迹报告。代表们互相交流了经验，讨论了首长的指示，一致表示今后坚决为贯彻执行党的总路线、投入技术革命和文化革命，为多快好省地建设祖国铁路而奋斗。
    会议期间，共青团中央代表张继明曾到会祝贺，勉励铁道兵青年在技术革命中一马当先。
    大会选出了七位青年战士为出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。
