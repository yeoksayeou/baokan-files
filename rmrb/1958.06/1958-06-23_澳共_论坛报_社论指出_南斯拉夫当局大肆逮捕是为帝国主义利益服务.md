Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Sydney: The Australian Communist Party's organ "Tribune" recently published an editorial on the arrests of people opposing the current policies by the Yugoslav authorities, saying that this matter "exposed the essence of revisionism."

The "Tribune" said that these arrests also exposed the absurdity of the claims made by Tito, Kardelj, and all revisionists that the state in Yugoslavia is "withering away."

"The Tribune" said, "It is absurd to talk about the state in Yugoslavia withering away when the first stage of communism has not been reached and there are still remnants of capitalism."

The editorial said: "The mass arrests by the security police not only prove that the state continues to exist, but also sharply raise the question – in whose class interests is the state being used? Is it being used to deal with the enemies of socialism as it should be… or is it being used to deal with the opponents of capitalism, the protectors of socialism?"

"Tribune" concluded: "The arrest of citizens in Yugoslavia who are loyal to the principles of socialism demonstrates more clearly than ever that revisionism is an anti-working class, anti-communist trend that only benefits the interests of the imperialist bourgeoisie."

    澳共“论坛报”社论指出
    南斯拉夫当局大肆逮捕是为帝国主义利益服务
    新华社21日讯  悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛报”最近就南斯拉夫当局逮捕反对现行政策的人一事发表社论说，这件事情“暴露了修正主义的本质”。
    “论坛报”说，这些逮捕事件也暴露了铁托、卡德尔和所有修正主义者提出的在南斯拉夫国家“正在消亡”的说法是荒谬的。
    “论坛报”说，“在共产主义的第一阶段还没有达到，还有资本主义残余存在的时候就谈什么国家在南斯拉夫正在消亡，这是荒谬的”。
    社论说：“保安警察大肆逮捕一事，不仅证明国家继续存在，而且很尖锐地提出了一个问题——国家正在被用来为谁的阶级利益服务？它是像它原来应当的那样被用来对付社会主义的敌人……或是被用来对付资本主义的反对者、社会主义的保护者？”
    “论坛报”最后说：“在南斯拉夫忠于社会主义原则的公民遭到逮捕这件事情，比任何时候都更加清楚地表明，修正主义是一股反工人阶级、反共的趋势，它只是有利于帝国主义资产阶级的利益”。
