    Modern Small Operas Are Worth Watching
    In the current joint performance of modern-themed operas in Beijing, some small operas, such as the Wuhan Chu Opera Troupe's "Three Shoulder Changes," "Two Brothers," "Conquering the Dongzi Dike," and the Fujian Min Opera Experimental Troupe's "The Persuader," "Returning," and "Song of the Sea Fishermen," are all very worthwhile. It's true: a play's value isn't in its size, but in how well it's performed.
    The themes of these small operas are novel, reflecting the people's full enthusiasm in production and construction, as well as new styles in daily life from many perspectives. For example, "Three Shoulder Changes" tells the story of farmers delivering public grain, where the masses want to help military families, but the military families actively take the lead everywhere. Such a small story is performed with great interest and is particularly popular with soldier audiences. "The Persuader" depicts a small episode in the patriotic health campaign in the city, showing that individuals with bad habits can consciously correct themselves under the supervision and help of the masses. What is exciting is the performance of the actors in these small operas, which shows great skill in inheriting traditional performance techniques. We can especially see this achievement in the Min Opera "Song of the Sea Fishermen" and the Chu Opera "Conquering the Dongzi Dike," and the audience even applauded the actors' dance. (Tree)

    现代小戏有看头
    正在北京举行的现代题材戏曲联合公演中，有一些小戏，如武汉市楚剧团的“三换肩”、“两兄弟”、“征服洞子堰”，福建省闽剧实验剧团的“劝导员”、“归来”、“海上渔歌”等，都大有看头。真是：戏不在大小，就看演得好不好。
    这些小戏的题材新颖，从多方面反映了人民群众在生产建设中的十足干劲，和日常生活中的新风格。如“三换肩”写的是农民送公粮时，群众要帮助军属，军属却处处积极带头。这么一个小故事，演的富有情趣，特别受到战士观众的欢迎。“劝导员”写的却是城市里搞爱国卫生运动中的小插曲，表现了个别有不良习惯的人，在群众的监督和帮助下，也能自觉改正的生动场面。令人兴奋的是这些小戏演员的表演，在继承传统的表现技巧上很看得出功夫。我们从闽剧“海上渔歌”和楚剧“征服洞子堰”中，尤其能看到这方面的成绩，观众甚至为演员的舞蹈叫起好来。　（树）
