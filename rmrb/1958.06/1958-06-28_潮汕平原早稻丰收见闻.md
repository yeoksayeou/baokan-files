A Glimpse of the Early Rice Harvest in the Chao汕 Plain
By our reporter

    Good News
    These days, the Chao汕 Plain is immersed in the joy of an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice. Jinpu Township is an ordinary village in Chaoyang County, at the southern end of the Chao汕 Plain. On the 18th, when the reporter arrived at the cultivation area of the 17th team of Nanmen Cooperative in Jinpu Township, team leader Zheng Taoxi was busy weighing the newly harvested rice next to the field, and the statistician was fiddling with the abacus. A field in the team yielded only 580 jin per mu last year, and this year's early crop was estimated to yield only 650 jin. Now, Zheng Taoxi and Zheng Yunyi say it yields 847 jin per mu. As soon as a team member heard the news, he ran to the field without waiting for the captain's instructions and loudly announced the good news to the rice harvesters. The entire production team couldn't help but cheer and laugh. Zheng Yinbo proudly said, "Just wait and see! Even higher yields are yet to come!"
    Cooperative cadres told reporters that Zheng Taoxi's team was so excited, and other teams were the same. The average yield of 10,000 mu of early rice in the township reached 656 jin per mu, an increase of 20% over last year, creating a historical record!
    Harvest on the Burial Grounds
    The Chao汕 area carried out a land leveling campaign last winter and spring. Was the rice harvest good on the burial grounds? In order to find answers for readers, the reporter rushed to Guanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Chenghai County, the birthplace of land leveling, on the 19th. Guanshan Cooperative put the most effort into the 334 mu of land in Xipan Yang during the land leveling. Now, the rice fields here are vast, the irrigation and drainage channels are neat and tidy, and the roads are wide and straight, which is very spectacular; the cooperative members are rushing to harvest the early rice. The cooperative members said that this area of early rice can yield more than 600 jin per mu, which is more than 100 jin per mu more than the unlevelled Dongpan Yang, adding 200,000 jin of rice to the agricultural cooperative's income.
    A few months ago, when the reporter arrived at Xipan Yang in Guanshan Cooperative, there were tombs standing everywhere, and the mounds were uneven. The land between the mounds and tombs was called "salty gardens" and "salt fields" by the farmers. Sweet potatoes grew as big as beans, and rice simply couldn't grow. However, after more than two months of hard work by the cooperative members, expending 120,000 labor days, moving more than 13,000 tombs to the mountains, removing more than 6,000 mounds, and covering each mu of cultivated land with 1,100 dan of pond mud, these "salty gardens" and "salt fields" were transformed into a "high-yield ocean." However, now cooperative director Zhou Qiubo said to the reporter again: "The cooperative members are also determined to further transform this 'high-yield ocean' into a 'high-yield ocean' in the late crop."
    Provincial Party Secretary and Farmers
    In the rice fields of Yunguang Cooperative in Jieyang County, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, led some members of the Provincial Party Committee's production inspection team and was harvesting rice with the farmers. The scorching sun was in the sky, and the sickles were waving, sometimes advancing in a straight line, and sometimes breaking through in the middle to form a "human" shape. Comrade Tao Zhu was working side by side with veteran farmer Lin Yancheng, a national model for high yield, with the girls and young men from the cooperative next to them. Everyone was working happily, and in the blink of an eye, a large area of golden rice was harvested.
    The rice threshing machine was humming behind the rice harvesters. Then, Comrade Tao Zhu turned around to participate in threshing. Lin Yancheng praised the Provincial Party Secretary's good labor with a smile.
    Comrade Tao Zhu's short-sleeved knit shirt was soaked with sweat, but like an old farmer who was used to hard work, he picked up the scattered grains of rice as soon as he stopped threshing.
    The Story of Counting Rice Ears
    Two days ago, the Junmin Friendship Cooperative in Binhai, Chenghai County, took more than 30 officers and soldiers sent by the People's Liberation Army to help with rice harvesting to that large field in Weizai. It was really strange, Deputy Instructor Feng Defu took off his shoes and bent down to count the grains in the field. The newly recruited soldiers were baffled. The old soldiers told them the origin of the Deputy Instructor's counting of the grains.
    This spring, it was also this Deputy Instructor Feng Defu who led more than 110 soldiers to level the land here day and night, personally removing the large earth dam that originally lay in the middle of the field, filling in the original large mud pit, and building a large ditch 150 meters long. How many soldiers had dripped sweat and cut their hands and feet here. Now, the Deputy Instructor and the old soldiers came again with the hands that had been blistered during land leveling, but this time, they came to harvest the fruits of their blood and sweat. The Deputy Instructor naturally wanted to count the grains. The new soldiers listened and worked even harder to cut the rice.
    Night Business
    Stepping into Anbu Town in Chao'an County, many shops were closed, and strips of paper were posted at the entrance of the shops, writing "Went to the countryside to harvest rice" and other words. People in the town said that in order to support the summer harvest, the market order was rearranged, with harvesting in the countryside during the day and opening the market at night. Schools were also closed, and doctors went to the agricultural cooperatives.
    In the rice fields of Guo Long Agricultural Cooperative, the reporter ran into a group of cadres from Anbu Town shops. Although they were not skilled at cutting, they were very enthusiastic. They said that when they returned to the town at night, they would leave one or two people to open the shop, and the rest would carry the goods and sell them to the cooperative members' homes. If the cooperative members wanted anything that was not available temporarily, they would register it and send it tomorrow. They said that they had supported the summer harvest and also exercised themselves.
    In the evening, the reporter returned to Shantou along the Chao汕 Highway and saw that the highway was crowded with people. It turned out that they were all workers, citizens, cadres, students, and shop assistants from Shantou who had gone to the countryside to help the agricultural cooperatives harvest rice and were returning home.

    潮汕平原早稻丰收见闻
    本报记者
    报喜
    这几天，潮汕平原沉浸在早稻空前大丰收的喜悦里。金浦乡是潮汕平原南端潮阳县的一个普通乡村。18日记者到金浦乡南门社第十七队耕作区的时候，队长郑桃溪正在刚收获的稻子旁边忙着过秤，统计员拨弄着算盘。队里的一块田，去年亩产不过五百八十斤，今年早造也只估产六百五十斤。现在郑桃溪和郑允怡却说它亩产八百四十七斤。一个队员一听到这个消息，不等队长吩咐，撒腿向田里奔去，对收割稻子的人高声宣布这个喜讯。全个生产队禁不住欢呼大笑。郑银波骄傲地说：“等着瞧吧！更高的产量还在后头哩！”
    社干部告诉记者说：郑桃溪队是这样兴高彩烈，别的队也一样。全乡一万亩早稻平均亩产达到六百五十六斤，比去年增产二成，都创造了历史纪录呢！
    坟地上的收成
    潮汕地区去冬今春进行了土地平整运动。坟地的稻子收成好吗？记者为了替读者找寻答案，19日赶到平整土地的发源地——澄海县冠山农业社。冠山社平整土地的时候，在西畔洋这三百三十四亩土地上下的功夫最多。现在这里稻田一片，排灌渠道整整齐齐，道路宽坦笔直，非常壮观；社员们正在抢收早稻。社员们说，这一片早稻每亩可收六百多斤，比未平整的东畔洋每亩多收一百多斤，共给农业社增加了二十万斤稻谷的收入。
    几个月前，记者到冠山社西畔洋的时候，这里边坟墓林立，土堆凸凹。土堆和坟墓间隙的土地，农民把它叫做“咸园”、“盐场”，甘薯长得像豆子大，水稻根本长不出来。但经过社员们苦战了两个多月，付出十二万个劳动日，把这里一万三千多个坟墓移上山，搬掉六千多个土堆，在每亩耕地覆盖上一千一百担塘泥后，才使这些“咸园”、“盐场”换来了一个“丰产洋”的美名。可是，现在社主任周秋波又对记者说：“晚造社员们还决心进一步把这块‘丰产洋’改变为‘高产洋’”。
    省委书记与农民
    在揭阳县云光社的稻田里，中共广东省委第一书记陶铸率领省委生产检查团的一些人员正和农民在一起割稻。骄阳当空，镰刀挥动处，时而“一”字儿排开地前进，时而中间突破成为“人”字形。陶铸同志和老农——全国丰产模范林炎城并肩地操作着，旁边还有社里的姑娘们和小伙子们。大伙干的欢，转眼间金黄的稻子收割了一大片。
    打谷机达达响在割稻的人们背后。跟着，陶铸同志转过身来参加打谷。林炎城笑眼眯眯地赞美省委书记的好劳动。
    陶铸同志身上的短袖线衣被汗水湿透了，但他像一个勤快惯了的老农一样，打谷刚停手，又随手拣起零落的谷穗来。
    数谷穗的故事
    前两天，澄海县滨海的军民友谊社，把解放军派来帮助割稻的三十多个官兵，带到围仔那一大片田里。真怪，副指导员冯德富脱下鞋子，就到田里弯下腰细数谷粒。刚入伍的战士莫名其妙。老战士向他们叙述了副指导员数谷粒的来历。
    今年春天，也是这个副指导员冯德富，带领了一百一十多个战士日日夜夜在这里平整土地，亲手把原来横在田中间的大土坝搬走，填平了原来的大泥坑，还修了一条一百五十公尺长的大水沟。多少战士在这里滴过汗刈破过手脚。现在，副指导员和老战士，带着平整土地时曾经磨过血泡的那双手又来了，不过，这回是来收获血汗的果实。副指导员自然要数谷粒了。新战士听了，割禾的劲头更大了。
    夜间营业
    踏进潮安县庵埠镇，很多商店关上门，店门口贴着一张张纸条，上写“下乡割稻去了”等字样，镇里的人说，为了支援夏收，市场的秩序作了重新安排，白天下乡收割，夜里才开市。学校也放假了，医生分别到了农业社。
    在郭垅农业社的稻田里，记者碰见庵埠镇商店的一群干部，他们割得虽然不够熟练，可是干劲很大。他们说，晚间回到镇上，就留一二人开店，其余的挑起货担到社员家里售卖。社员要什么，临时没有的，就登记起来明天送去。他们说，支援了夏收，也锻炼了自己。
    傍晚，记者沿着潮汕公路回汕头，只见公路上挤着人，原来都是汕头的工人、市民、干部、学生、店员，他们也都是下乡帮助农业社割稻回家的人。
