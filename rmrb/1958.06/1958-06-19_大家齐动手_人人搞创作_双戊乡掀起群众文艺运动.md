Everyone Pitches In, Everyone Creates
Shuangwu Township Launches Mass Literary and Art Movement

    (Reported by this newspaper) A mass literary and art movement of "everyone pitches in, everyone creates, writes about the advanced, creates the advanced" is vigorously developing in Shuangwu Township, Jiangdu, Jiangsu. Of the township's population of over 26,000, more than 8,300 people are actively participating in creation, mostly farmers, grassroots cadres, teachers, students, and backbone members of mass culture. Every agricultural cooperative has established an amateur writing group. In the past five months of this year, the number of written and oral works has reached more than 79,000.

    The works created by the masses of farmers themselves have very broad themes, and the content and form are also very lively. There are impassioned slogans reflecting the Great Leap Forward in production, poems and ditties praising the advanced and commending the advanced, as well as various popular literary and artistic pieces reflecting the masses' struggle against natural disasters and promoting technological innovation.

    The mass literary and artistic creation of the township has become an assistant to promote production and various movements, and a weapon for the masses to educate and entertain themselves. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production, tens of thousands of wall posters written by the farmers themselves were painted on the walls of villages throughout the township: "If fertilizer accumulation does not reach 10,000 dan, you can't be considered a hero," ..., magnificent poems were everywhere. After many agricultural cooperatives achieved success in production, they compiled their deeds into good news reports in the form of clapper talks, ditties, short poems, etc., to report the good news to the township Party committee; the Sandang Agricultural Cooperative described the spirit of all its members to achieve the increased production target: "People fill the fields during the day, every house locks its doors; lights fill the fields at night, better than Nanjing City." Some cooperatives even used this literary and artistic form to write down the conditions for competitions and challenges, and sent out proposals for competition to each other. Recently, they compiled the deeds of Chen Xiuyun, director of Chen Dian Agricultural Cooperative and a Communist Party member in this township, who discovered the danger of the embankment and led more than 400 people to bravely rescue it, saving more than 500 mu of wheat fields and more than 40 mu of small seedlings from damage, into stories and spread them everywhere. After the start of summer harvesting and planting, literary and artistic creation became more active, with blackboards full of inspiring poems, and even farm tools were inscribed with them.

    The reason why mass creation in this township can be carried out so extensively is mainly that the Shuangwu Township Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a representative meeting of mass creation in a timely manner to understand the creative potential; put forward the requirements of a great leap forward in creation, write about what you do, and write about what you are engaged in; according to the characteristics of the creative team, it separately put forward creative indicators, formulated an annual creative plan, and determined that the township slogan is: create 100,000 pieces throughout the year, everyone creates and writes every day, the quantity and quality leap forward together, and cooperate with production to lead the way.

### 大家齐动手　人人搞创作  双戊乡掀起群众文艺运动

    大家齐动手　人人搞创作
    双戊乡掀起群众文艺运动
    本报讯　一个“大家动手、人人创作、编写先进、创作先进”的群众文艺运动，在江苏江都的双戊乡蓬勃地开展起来。全乡二万六千多人口就有八千三百多人积极参加创作，他们大都是农民、基层干部、教师、学生和群众文化骨干。每个农业社都成立了业余创作组。今年五个月以来，编写和口头创作的作品，已达七万九千多件。
    农民群众自己编创的作品，题材非常广阔，内容和形式也很生动活泼。有反映生产大跃进的豪言壮语，有歌颂先进表扬先进的诗歌小调，也有反映群众向自然灾害斗争、宣传技术革新等内容的各种通俗文艺小品。
    该乡的群众文艺创作，已经成为推动生产和各项运动的助手，成为群众自我教育自我娱乐的武器。在生产大跃进的高潮中，全乡各地村庄的墙壁上，都刷写数以万计的农民自己编写的墙头诗：“积肥不达万担，不算英雄好汉”，……，雄壮的诗篇到处皆是。很多农业社在生产取得成绩后，都把自己的事迹用快板、小调、短诗等的格式编成喜报，向乡党委报喜；三荡农业社在表述全体社员为实现增产指标的干劲时，作了这样描写：“白天满地人、家家锁大门；晚上满地灯，赛过南京城”。有的社，还用这种文艺形式写着比赛和摆擂台的条件，互相传送倡议竞赛。最近他们把本乡陈甸农业社主任、共产党员陈修云发现圩堤危险，带领四百多人奋勇抢救，使五百多亩麦田四十多亩小秧未受损失的事迹，编成故事到处传颂。夏收夏种开始后，文艺创作更加活跃，在小黑板上布满了鼓动诗，有的农具上都写上了。
    该乡群众创作能这样广泛开展起来，主要是中共双戊乡党委适时地召开群众创作代表会，摸清创作潜力；提出创作大跃进、干什么写什么、做哪行就写哪行的要求；按照创作队伍的特点，分别提出了创作指标，制订了全年的创作规划，确定全乡口号是：全年创作十万件，人人创作天天编，数量质量齐跃进，配合生产走在先。（人伟）
