Agriculture Cooperatives Run Industry
——Communication No. 4 on Local Industry in Zunyi County
By our reporters Zhou Jingyu, Guo Longchun

Among the local industries in Zunyi County, the fastest-growing and largest in number are those run by agricultural cooperatives. According to statistics from the Zunyi County Party Committee, as of April 25th, among the factories and mines already in production, 206 were projects at or above the township level, and 8,294 were run by agricultural cooperatives, indicating a rapid development speed of industries run by agricultural cooperatives. How were so many industries established? How are they managed and led? How are wages calculated? These are questions of concern to everyone.

To seek answers to these questions, we visited the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative and the Great Storm Agricultural Cooperative. The former is an experimental cooperative of the Zunyi Prefectural Party Committee, and the latter is an experimental cooperative of the Zunyi County Party Committee. Usually, many people from various places visit these two cooperatives, some to see water conservancy construction, some to see agricultural technology reforms, and some to see industries run by the cooperatives. When we arrived at these two cooperatives, a delegation from the ethnic minorities in Yunnan had just left.

Renaming and Riding the Tide

The branch secretary of the Red Star Cooperative and the director of the Great Storm Cooperative briefed us on their respective cooperatives' situations and led us to visit their hydropower stations, farm implement factories, and brick and tile factories.

Speaking of the development of industry, as early as 1955, when agricultural cooperation began, sporadic industries appeared in rural areas. However, at that time, they were not called industries but sideline occupations. With the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives, the operation of sideline occupations also expanded.

From 1955 to 1957, the industrial development of the Red Star Cooperative was as follows:

(Omitted chart)

In 1958, to meet the requirements of the great leap forward in agriculture, under the leadership of the Party, this cooperative planned to build and expand more than 40 projects, including 19 lime kilns, 5 tile kilns, 2 sulfur factories, 3 flour mills, several granular fertilizer factories, and one each of tobacco curing, potassium sulfate, paper mill, earthenware jar, crude alkali, saltpeter, and artificial cotton factories. In addition, a new 90-kilowatt power station was built (the original power station was only 25 kilowatts). By the end of this year, it is planned to have 113 production units, with an industrial income of 445,000 yuan, accounting for 40.5% of the cooperative's total income of 1.1 million yuan.

Studying the situation of the Red Star Cooperative, we found that the cooperative's industry has the following three characteristics:

First, it developed on the basis of developing sideline occupations. The industrial funds are basically not a problem. The various workshops and brick and tile factories operated by the agricultural cooperative in the past, except for the animal husbandry part, are essentially the primary stage of industry. In the case of underdeveloped mechanical industry, it is bound to rely on the various workshops in the primary stage to produce.

Second, it started from the needs of agricultural production. Whatever is needed is produced. For example, lime kilns and coal kilns have developed in response to the need for water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and some industrial and daily needs. 70% of the land in the Red Star Cooperative is acidic soil, and there are also some rotten paddy fields, cold water fields, and yellow mud fields, which greatly limit agricultural production. According to research and experiments by agricultural scientists, using 6,000 catties of lime per mu as fertilizer in acidic soil resulted in an average yield of 860 catties per mu, proving that lime is a good fertilizer for improving acidic soil. As a result, the demand for lime has increased, and the demand for coal has also increased. At the same time, as agricultural output increases, workshops suitable for processing agricultural products also increase.

Third, most of it is self-produced and self-supplied, and only individual products are sold as commodities under contract with state-owned factories, such as crude alkali and sulfur.

The situation of the Great Storm Agricultural Cooperative is roughly the same as that of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative. Each of their production teams has a lime kiln and a granular fertilizer factory, all of which are directly aimed at meeting the production needs of the agricultural cooperative. Only the brick and tile factory and the rice milling factory attached to the power station, in addition to self-use, have surplus capacity to process grain and produce bricks and tiles for the state.

Leadership Through to the End

So how are so many factories managed? Speaking of production management, it is not unfamiliar to agricultural cooperatives. In the past, when agricultural cooperatives ran sideline occupations, they had a deputy director responsible for sideline occupations. Now that the scale of production has expanded, based on past experience, they have established a unified organization to manage industry from top to bottom. The agricultural cooperative has a deputy director in charge of industry, and the production team also has a deputy captain in charge of industry. Except for individual larger factories to which the cooperative management committee sends full-time or semi-full-time factory directors, most factories appoint workers to serve as factory directors (production units of two or three to five or six people are called team leaders). These small factories are led by the cooperative director in business and managed by the production team leader in daily labor arrangements. The products produced are all handed over to the cooperative management committee for distribution or disposal. Because some factories have very few people, a factory director often holds several positions, being both a worker and a factory director, a technician and an accountant. This set of organizational management, in their words, is called unified leadership from start to finish.

Will the arrangement of labor affect agricultural production with so many industrial production units established? Generally speaking, it will not. Because most of the factories run by agricultural cooperatives are directly managed by the production team, although members have relatively fixed professional divisions of labor in industrial and agricultural production, they can also be adjusted at any time according to the specific situation when agricultural production requires it. The Great Storm Agricultural Cooperative has a total labor force of 2,460 people, of which 404 people participate in industrial production (including sideline occupations), accounting for more than 16% of the total labor force. Basically, it has no impact on agricultural production. The situation of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative is roughly the same. However, because there is a state-owned sulfur factory near this cooperative, it has absorbed part of the labor force, and the cooperative has also sent some people out to learn technology, so that individual production teams have shown signs of insufficient labor. For example, the third team of the first branch of Red Star originally had 43 laborers. Due to various transfers, only 20 people are left now. The fourth team of the second branch of Red Star originally had 25 laborers, and 8 people were transferred to engage in industry, leaving 17 people. In response to this situation, the leaders of the Red Star Cooperative plan to take two measures to solve it: first, adhere to the policy of serving agricultural production. During the busy farming season, resolutely obey the needs of agricultural production, temporarily suspend industry to support agriculture, and any projects that can be postponed or not done will not be done. Second, vigorously improve production tools and save labor. In the past, the Red Star Brick and Tile Factory needed three cows and three people to tread mud every day. Recently, a wooden mud-treading machine has been adopted, which only requires one person to manage, without the need for cattle, and the work efficiency has increased by six and a half times. We believe that the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative's guiding ideology is correct. Agricultural cooperatives must not put industry in the main position and agriculture in the secondary position. If the primary and secondary are not distinguished and the importance is reversed, then this kind of agricultural cooperative may lose its direction and cannot be regarded as an agricultural cooperative.

Payment by Output, Rewards for Overproduction

How should agricultural cooperatives calculate wages for members participating in industrial production to be reasonable? This is also a major issue related to the direction of development of agricultural cooperatives.

In 1956, the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative adopted the method of separating agricultural and industrial remuneration. As a result, those engaged in agriculture did not care about industry, and those engaged in industry did not care about agriculture. In 1957, they delegated the factories to the team, and work-point remuneration was calculated on the average of the total income of agriculture and industry. In this way, the quality of industrial production affected the income of those engaged in agriculture, and the quality of agricultural production also affected the income of those engaged in industry. Agricultural production and industrial production became one, and those engaged in agriculture and those engaged in industry also cared about each other.

Now, they still use the agricultural "payment by output, rewards for overproduction" work-point accounting method in labor remuneration, keeping it the same as agriculture. This is the most basic accounting method. In addition, there is a form called stipulating quotas and fixed wages. This form is rarely used except for a few technicians.

According to the specific situation of this cooperative, the income of each labor day in agriculture is about ten work points, while the labor force in industry is slightly higher than that in agriculture. For example:

It is stipulated that 200 catties of rapeseed are used for each oil extraction, with an oil yield of 34.5%. Each extraction is 36 work points, and three people work for one day, with each labor day earning 12 work points;

The lime kiln is calculated according to output, with ten work points for every 200 catties.

The Great Storm Agricultural Cooperative stipulates three methods of accounting for work points: one is payment by output, for example, 350 bricks or 600 tiles can each earn ten work points. One is piece-rate, such as a table counting as 30 work points. The other is fixed-work production, fixed quota subsidies, stipulating that each full-time cadre and part-time cadre must participate in a part of the cooperative's labor production every month and earn a certain number of labor work points. Those who exceed the stipulated labor days can earn more work points; those who cannot complete the stipulated labor days will have it deducted from their due subsidy work points.

In terms of overproduction awards, different bonus ratios are determined according to different production conditions. The Red Star Cooperative stipulates: for coal mining, 10% of the cash income of the excess part is awarded; for tile burning and oil extraction, 20% is awarded. If the production plan is not completed, 10% of the work points of the uncompleted income will be deducted.

The above-mentioned regulations not only take into account the characteristics of various different types of work, but also take into account the relationship between agriculture and industry. At the same time, they also prevent the bias of some cadres from deviating from the reality of labor. This has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses to study technology and improve production. Therefore, these regulations are in line with the interests of agricultural cooperatives.

The issue of agricultural cooperatives running industry is a relatively complex issue, and what we have come into contact with is only a part of the issue. As for the proportion of agriculture and industry in agricultural cooperatives, what is the appropriate ratio? What should be done if the proportion of industry is too large? Usually, what is the appropriate number of the agricultural cooperative's labor force participating in industrial production? These issues need to be studied and resolved by everyone.

    农业社办工业
    ——遵义县地方工业通讯之四
    本报记者　周静宇　郭龙春
    遵义县地方工业中发展最快、数量最大的是农业社办的工业。根据遵义县委统计：截至4月25日止，已经投入生产的厂矿中，乡以上的项目有二百零六个，农业社办的有八千二百九十四个，这说明农业社的工业发展速度是很快的。这么多的工业是怎么办起来的？怎样管理、怎样领导？怎样计算工资？这是大家关心的问题。
    为了寻求问题的答案，我们访问了红星农业社和大风暴农业社，前者是中共遵义地委的实验社，后者是中共遵义县委的实验社。平时，各地到这两个社参观的人很多，有参观水利建设的，有参观农业技术改革的，也有参观社办工业的，当我们到达这两个社的时候，来自云南的民族参观团刚刚离开。
    改名换姓，顺水推舟
    红星社的支部书记和大风暴社的主任分别向我们介绍了社内的情况，并领我们参观了他们的水电站、农具制造厂、砖瓦厂。
    谈到工业的发展，早在1955年开始搞农业合作化的时候，农村就出现了零星的工业，不过，当时不叫做工业，叫做副业。随着农业社的发展和巩固，副业的经营也日益扩大。
    从1955年到1957年，红星社的工业发展情况如下：
    （图表略）
    1958年，这个社为了适应农业大跃进的要求，在党的领导下有计划地新建和扩建了四十多个项目，包括：石灰窑十九个、瓦窑五个、硫磺厂两个、粉厂三个、颗粒肥料厂若干个、烤烟、硫酸钾、纸厂、砂罐、土碱、土硝、人造棉厂各一个，另外，新建九十瓩的电站一处（原有电站只有二十五瓩），到今年年底计划达到一百十三个生产单位，工业收入四十四万五千元，占全社总收入一百一十万元的40.5％。
    我们研究红星社的情况，觉得这个社的工业有以下三个特点：
    其一、它是从发展副业的基础上发展起来的，工业资金基本上不成问题，原来农业社所经营的副业，除了畜牧部分外，各种作坊、砖瓦窑厂，实质上就是工业的初级阶段。在机械工业还不发达的情况下，就必然要依赖那些处于初级阶段的各种作坊来生产了。
    其二、它是从农业生产需要出发的。需要什么，就搞什么。像石灰窑和煤窑就是在兴修水利改良土壤以及部分工业和日用需要的情况下发展起来的。红星社有70％的田地是酸性土壤，还有一些烂包田、冷水田、黄泥田，农业产量受到很大的限制。据农业科学人员研究试验，在酸性土壤里每亩用六千斤石灰作肥料，结果，平均每亩产量达八百六十斤，证明用石灰是改良酸性土壤的良好肥料。于是，石灰的需要量增加了，煤炭的需要量也增加了。同时，农业的产量增加了，适应于农产品加工的作坊也增加了。
    其三、绝大部分是自产自给，只有个别产品同国营工厂签立合同作为商品出卖。如土碱、硫磺。
    大风暴农业社的情况和红星农业社大致相同。他们每个生产队都有个石灰窑和颗粒肥料厂，都是直接为农业社生产需要出发的，只有砖瓦厂和电站附设的打米厂除了自用以外，还有多余力量替国家加工粮食、生产砖瓦。
    领导一竿子到底
    那么多的工厂究竟怎样管理呢？谈到生产管理对农业社来说也不是生疏的事情。过去，农业社办副业的时候，曾经设有副业主任，专门负责。现在，生产规模扩大了，他们根据过去的经验，从上到下建立了管理工业的统一组织。农业社有个副主任管工业，生产队里也有个副队长管工业。除了个别较大的厂子由社管会派去专职厂长或半专职厂长以外，绝大部分厂子都是指派工人兼任厂长（两、三人到五、六人的生产单位叫组长）。这类小厂在业务上归社主任领导，在日常劳动安排上由生产队长管理。生产的产品统交社管会决定分配或处理，有些厂子因为人手很少，一个厂长常常身兼数职，是工人又是厂长，是技术员又是会计员。这套组织管理，用他们的话来说，叫做一鞭到底的统一领导。
    办起这么多工业生产单位，在劳动力的安排上会不会影响农业生产呢？一般地说，还不会。因为农业社办的工厂绝大部分由生产队直接管理，社员们在工业和农业的生产上虽然有比较固定的专业分工，但是在农业生产需要的时候，也可以根据具体情况随时调节。大风暴农业社共有劳动力二千四百六十人，其中参加工业生产的（包括副业）四百零四人，占整个劳动力的16％多。基本上对农业生产没有影响。红星农业社的情况也大体相同，不过，这个社的附近有个国营硫磺厂吸收去了一部分劳动力，社内又输送了一些人出去学技术，以致个别生产队出现劳力不足的苗头。例如红星一分社三队原有劳动力四十三人，因各方面抽调，现在只剩下二十人。红星二分社四队原有劳动力二十五人，抽去八个人搞工业，剩下十七人。针对这个情况，红星社的领导方面打算采取两个办法来解决：一、坚持为农业生产服务的方针，在农忙季节坚决服从农业生产的需要，把工业暂时停下来支援农业，某些可以缓办和不办的项目就一律不办。二、大力改进生产工具，节省劳动力。红星砖瓦厂过去每天要三条牛三个人踩泥巴，最近，采用了一种木制踩泥机，只要一个人管理，不用耕牛，工作效率提高六倍半。我们觉得红星农业社的领导思想是对头的，农业社决不能把工业放在主要地位，把农业放在次要地位，如果主次不分，轻重倒置，那么，这种农业社就有可能走失方向，不能算做农业社了。
    按产计酬，超产有奖
    农业社对于参加工业生产的社员究竟怎样计算工资才算合理？也是关系到农业社发展方向的一个大问题。
    红星农业社在1956年曾经采取农业和工业分开计酬的办法，结果，搞农业的不关心工业，搞工业的又不关心农业。1957年他们把工厂下放到队，工分报酬按农业和工业的总收入平均计算，这样，工业生产的好坏影响到搞农业的收入，农业生产的好坏也影响到搞工业的收入，农业生产和工业生产变成一家了，搞农业和搞工业的也相互关心了。
    现在，他们在劳动报酬上仍然采用农业上的“按产计酬，超产奖励”的记工分办法，和农业保持一家。这是最基本的记分办法。另外，有一种形式，叫做规定定额，固定工资。这种形式除了少数技术人员采用以外，一般很少采用。
    根据这个社的具体情况，现在，农业的每个劳动日的所得大约十个工分，工业的每个劳动力则稍高于农业。例如：
    规定每榨油用菜子二百斤，出油率34.5％，每榨三十六工分，三人工作一天，每个劳动日得十二工分；
    石灰窑按产量计，每二百斤十个工分。
    大风暴农业社规定三种记工分的方法：一种按产计酬，譬如，打砖三百五十块，打瓦六百片可各得十个工分。一种按件记分，如一张桌子算三十个工分。再一种是定工生产，定额补助，规定每个专职干部和兼职干部每月必须参加一部分社内劳动生产，收入一定的劳动工分。超过规定的劳动日可以多得工分；不能完成规定劳动日的，就在他应得的补助工分中扣算。
    在超产奖励上，根据不同的生产情况确定不同的提奖比例。红星社规定：挖煤，按超额部分的现金收入提奖10％，烧瓦、榨油按20％，如果完不成生产计划，则扣完不成收入部分10％的工分。
    上述这些规定，既照顾到各个不同工种的特点，又照顾到农业和工业之间的关系，同时，又防止了部分干部脱离劳动实际的偏向。这就大大促进了群众钻研技术和提高生产的积极性。所以，这些规定都是符合农业社利益的。
    农业社办工业的问题，是一个比较复杂的问题，我们所接触到的只是问题的一部分。至于农业社的农业和工业比重到底控制在多大的比例数上才算合适？工业的比重过大了怎么办？平时，农业社参加工业生产的劳动力究竟占多少才算合适？这些问题，需要大家来研究解决。（附图表）
