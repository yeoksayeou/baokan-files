    Research Combined with Practice, Experts Combined with the Masses
    Shaanxi Scientific Research Sweeps the Province
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, June 17th, reporter Sun Chuanhao reports:) The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, breaking with the conservative conventions of the academy style, has adopted a working method of combining scientific research with practice and experts with the masses. It actively organizes collaboration and, in the short period of just over a month since its establishment, has seen scientific research work develop vigorously throughout the province, achieving the requirements of doing scientific undertakings in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.
    After the establishment of the Shaanxi Branch and its seven new research institutions at the end of April, they immediately devoted themselves to practical work in a down-to-earth manner. The Shaanxi Branch first helped Liquan County and the Fenghuo, Mingxing, and Baige agricultural cooperatives in the county to establish agricultural science research institutions, and also hired labor model Wang Baojing as a special researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute. Immediately afterwards, a batch of more than twenty similar research institutions were established successively in Gaoling, Zhashui, Luochuan, Danfeng and other counties and agricultural cooperatives, in order to gradually promote counties running science and cooperatives carrying out experiments.
    The newly established scientific research institutes (offices) for agricultural implements, geology, and power, although they only have one or two full-time researchers, or mainly rely on professors from universities, have also started work, breaking with the conservative idea of ​​waiting for everything to be ready before engaging in scientific research. The most active Agricultural Implements Research Institute currently has only one assistant researcher and one intern as full-time cadres. With the help of the Agricultural Machinery Department of Northwest Agricultural College, the Industry Department, and the Agricultural Implements Factory, they have conducted scientific research, analysis, and identification of more than 100 new types of agricultural implements for various places within a month. Since its establishment, this Agricultural Implements Research Institute has been deeply loved by the masses, and has received more than 400 letters from various places so far. One day, eight county party secretaries went to visit and ask for advice. The personnel of the Geological Research Office attached to Northwest University are all part-time. Recently, they have completed the compilation of six materials investigated in the past, including the Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, the Manas area in Xinjiang, and the northern Shaanxi basin, and written them into papers. The Power Research Institute has also achieved initial success in experimenting with biogas. The Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Sciences has changed its previous academy-style working routine. In the case of very few personnel and equipment, they do what they say. This innovative approach has been praised by representatives from scientific units in Jiangsu, Jilin and other provinces who came to visit. They unanimously believe that it is worthy of emulation by various places.
    The reason why scientific research in Shaanxi Province can be carried out rapidly is first and foremost that the research institutions at all levels are headed by the local party committees, who serve as the principal leaders. Zhao Shouyi, alternate secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and minister of propaganda, serves as the president of the Shaanxi Branch. The county and township party secretaries of some other county and agricultural cooperative research institutes (offices) also personally serve as the principal leaders.
    In the process of implementing the policy of combining experts and the masses, the Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Sciences also provides four effective ways of combining. First, scientific units or universities and colleges are linked with agricultural cooperatives and factories for cooperation. Northwest Agricultural College and Fenghuo Cooperative in Liquan County, which created high-yield corn production on a large area, have established this long-term liaison system. At present, Jiaotong University, Northwestern Polytechnical University and others in the Xi'an area have also generally established this cooperative relationship of scientific research with nearby factories. Second, scientific research units or universities and colleges establish comprehensive regional cooperation with special zones and counties. The Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute has been responsible for contracting Qian County and Yongshou County to cultivate banners for large-scale, high-yield production. It is necessary to enable the average cotton yield of the Qian County dryland to reach sixty catties this year, and to produce four townships with 100 catties of cotton. Northwest Agricultural College has long cooperated with Wugong and Liquan counties to comprehensively guide and help these areas in agricultural scientific research. Northwestern Polytechnical University has also recently sent a delegation to the Shangluo Special Zone to assist in running local industries. Third, scientific units hire well-known labor models and "scholars" from the masses as special researchers. In addition to hiring Wang Baojing as a special researcher, there are also plans to hire Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton planting expert from Weinan County, and Ma Tinghai, a production expert from Dali County, as special researchers. These researchers who do not leave production can participate in relevant technical meetings of scientific units and report on high-yield experience. Scientific units can also entrust tasks to them for research, and provide them with human and material support and assistance as much as possible when they encounter difficulties and problems in their work. Fourth, unfixed mobile cooperation, in the form of work teams (groups), organizes experts and the masses to combine. Recently, agricultural scientists such as Zhu Xiangshan and Xie Qingguan have led a working group to Suide and Qingjian to work with the local masses on comprehensive research on issues such as cultivation and moisture conservation, rational crop rotation, selection and breeding of drought-resistant crop varieties, improvement of cultivation techniques, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. The working group investigates and visits, helps the local area discover and sort out successful yield-increasing experiences, helps the masses improve, and promotes and introduces them.
    Shaanxi Province has adopted a variety of combinations of experts and the masses, and has taken the mass line to run scientific undertakings. Practice has proved that there are many benefits: First, it pushes scientific research to the forefront of production, which can solve the contradiction that science and technology are always catching up with current production needs to a certain extent. Second, after this combination, the scientific and technological level of the general public can be quickly improved, and their interest in scientific research can be cultivated, achieving both popularization and improvement. Third, the work process is actually a process of transforming the thinking of some scientific researchers, which can gradually guide them to establish the correct concept that scientific research must serve production, and vigorously overcome the purely academic work tendencies of the past that deviated from production and started from personal interests and hobbies. Fourth, it can greatly reduce the promotion procedures of various advanced science and technologies, and quickly blossom everywhere, achieving the effect of spreading without promotion.

    研究结合实际　专家结合群众
    陕西科学研究风行全省
    本报西安17日电　记者孙传镐报道：中国科学院陕西分院，打破学院式的守旧常规，采取科学研究与实际结合、专家和群众结合的工作方法，积极组织协作，在成立起后的短短一个多月中，科学研究工作就在全省蓬勃地开展起来，作到了多快好省办科学事业的要求。
    陕西分院和所属七个新的研究机构，在4月底建立以后，立即踏踏实实投入了实际工作。陕西分院首先帮助醴泉县和这个县烽火、明星、白鸽三个农业社，建立了农业科学研究机构，又聘请了劳动模范王保京为陕西省农业科学研究所特约研究员。紧接着又在高陵、柞水、洛川、丹凤等县和农业社先后建立了一批二十多个同类的研究机构，以逐步促进县县办科学、社社搞试验。
    初创的农具、地质、动力等七个科学研究所（室），虽然只有一、二个专职研究人员，或者主要靠高等学校的教授兼任，照样也展开了工作，打破了那种等待万事具备才能搞科学研究的保守思想。工作最活跃的农具研究所，目前只有一个助理研究员和一个实习员是专职干部。他们依靠西北农学院农业机械系、工业厅、农具厂等单位的帮助，一个月内已为各地一百多种新式农具，作了科学的研究分析和鉴定。这个农具研究所成立以来，深得群众爱戴，迄今共收到各地来信四百多件。有一天，八个县委书记不约而同去登门求教。附设在西北大学的地质研究室人员，全部是兼职。最近，他们已把过去调查的山西中条山、新疆玛纳斯地区、陕北盆地等六篇材料整理完毕，写成论文。动力研究所试验沼气也已初步成功。科学院陕西分院一变以往学院式工作常规，在人员设备极少的情况下，说干就干，这种革新的作法，得到了前来参观的江苏、吉林等省科学单位的代表的赞扬，他们一致认为值得各地仿效。
    陕西省科学研究工作能够迅速开展的原因，首先是各级研究机构都由当地党委挂帅，担任正职领导，陕西分院的院长由中共陕西省委候补书记兼宣传部长赵守一担任。其他一些县、农业社的研究所（室），也都是县、乡党委书记亲自担任正职。
    科学院陕西分院在贯彻专家和群众结合的方针过程中，还提供了四种有效的结合方式。第一，科学单位或大专学校同农业社、工厂挂钩协作。西北农学院和创造大面积高额玉米丰产的醴泉县烽火社，长期建立了这种联系制度。目前，西安地区交通大学、西北工业大学等，也都普遍和附近工厂建立了这种科学研究的协作关系。第二，科学研究单位或大专学校同专区、县建立地区性的全面协作。陕西省农业科学研究所已负责包干乾县、永寿两个县，培养大面积高额丰产的旗帜。要使乾县旱原今年皮棉平均达到六十斤，并出现四个百斤皮棉乡。西北农学院长期和武功、醴泉两个县合作，全面指导和帮助这些地区农业科学研究工作。西北工业大学也在最近派出代表团，到商雒专区协助办地方工业。第三，科学单位聘请著名劳动模范、群众中的“秀才”为特约研究员。目前除聘请了王保京为特约研究员外，还计划聘请渭南县植棉能手张秋香、大荔县生产能手马廷海等人作为特约研究员。这些不脱产的研究员，可参加科学单位有关的技术会议和作丰产经验报告外，科学单位也可委托任务，交给他们负责研究，在他们工作发生困难和问题时，尽量予以人力物力的支持和帮助。第四，不固定的流动性协作，以工作队（组）的形式，组织专家和群众结合。最近，朱象山、谢庆观等农业科学工作者，已率领一个工作组赴绥德、清涧一带，同当地群众一起，就耕作保墒、合理轮作、选育抗旱作物品种、改进栽培技术和防治病虫害等问题，作全面的综合研究。工作组一边调查访问，一边协助当地发现和整理成功的增产经验，一边帮助群众改进，一边推广和介绍。
    陕西省采取专家和群众多种多样结合，走群众路线办科学事业，实践证明已有不少好处：一、使科学研究工作推向到生产最前线，一定程度上可以解决科学技术老赶不上当前生产需要的矛盾。二、通过这样结合后，能够很快提高一般群众的科学技术水平，培养起他们对科学研究的兴趣，既达到普及，又有了提高。三、工作过程实际也是一些科学研究人员改造思想的过程，能够逐步正面引导他们建立起科学研究必须为生产服务的正确观念，大力克服过去脱离生产，凭个人兴趣爱好出发的纯学院式工作倾向。四、可以大大减少各类先进科学技术的推广程序，迅速遍地开花，达到不推而自广。（附图片）
