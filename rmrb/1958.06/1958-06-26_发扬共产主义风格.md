    Promoting the Communist Style
    Hou Tieping
    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party called on proletarian and people's warriors to "promote the noble style of resolutely believing in the truth, resolutely relying on the masses, and fearing no authority." This is the communist style. The daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and the unstoppable, invincible spirit shown by the Chinese people in the surging great leap forward of socialist construction is precisely this style.
    Every era and every class has its own style. The communist style is a manifestation of proletarian Party spirit. In the long dark night, when the capitalist system was still on the rise, Marx and Engels pointed out that the capitalist system was bound to perish and the proletariat would surely gain the whole world. When the darkest reactionary rule weighed like a mountain on the Chinese people, the Chinese Communists raised the red flag of victory. The vanguard of the proletariat, regardless of the darkness of the night, unafraid of cruel persecution and slaughter, thoroughly broke with all traditional concepts, carried out revolutionary criticism of various idols and authorities, despised all seemingly无比强大的corrupt systems, and fought tenaciously for the victory of the proletarian revolution with the spirit of "making mountains bow their heads and rivers give way."
    Now, the communist style is being promoted and developed into a style for the whole people. This is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, the spiritual flower of the socialist revolution. Bourgeois ideology, views, and habits are shackles that bind the people's spirit. The pursuit of fame and profit ties people up mentally, makes them short-sighted, weakens their revolutionary will, and makes them listless, passive, and passive all day long; a little bit of achievement makes them arrogant and unable to "climb to a higher level"; in the face of right and wrong, they stammer, have an ambiguous attitude, are timid as mice, and are full of vulgar habits. Anyone who does not remove the root of these evil winds cannot talk about communist style; if the poisonous cancer of individualism is not cut off, communist thought cannot take root and blossom. To have a communist style, one must thoroughly break with bourgeois ideas and views, destroy bourgeois ideology, promote proletarian ideology, pull down the white flag, and raise the red flag, and guide one's actions with a communist outlook on life. All those who have a noble style are those who have a firm communist outlook on life and wholeheartedly serve the people.
    The promotion of the communist style of the people is not only the result of the victory of proletarian ideology over bourgeois ideology, but also the result of materialism and dialectics overcoming subjectivism and metaphysics. According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, objective things are always developing and changing, new things will always defeat old things, and the development of history is always later than first. All science and theory are the result of summarizing the practice of the people's production struggle and class struggle. The rich and outstanding struggles currently being carried out by our 600 million people have created and will inevitably create countless miracles, and will surely surpass the past in science and technology, "the blue is better than the blue." However, dogmatists and empiricists deviate from reality and the masses, and treat the original face of the development of the objective world subjectively and metaphysically. Observing problems in life from a static and one-sided point of view, understanding lags behind the development of practice, seeing static but not dynamic, seeing gradual change but not sudden change, and treating China's socialist cause with a conservative attitude, creating various superstitions. Superstition of the dead, superstition of foreigners, superstition of bourgeois scholars, superstition of book knowledge or narrow experience, mystification of science and technology, failure to see the infinite creative ability of the liberated Chinese people, and disbelief in the revolutionary initiative of the people. Various superstitions bind their minds, filling them with endless fear and inferiority, they dare not say what the ancients, foreigners, and scholars have not said, they dare not do what they have not done, their minds are blocked, they belittle themselves, and they willingly surrender. Therefore, to have a noble style, we must thoroughly abandon the various inferiority complexes and superstitions that block people's minds, break subjectivism, empiricism, and dogmatism, resolutely rely on the masses, fully trust the creative ability of the masses, and guide our actions with materialism and dialectics. Only in this way can we be ambitious, boldly innovate and create, write down what is not in the books, create what is not in foreign countries, say what experts have not said, create what does not exist in the world, and dare to climb the peaks of science and technology.
    To have a communist style, on the one hand, one must have ardent revolutionary enthusiasm, revolutionary courage, and boldness, and dare to despise difficulties strategically, so that one can dare to imagine things that predecessors did not dare to imagine and do things that predecessors did not dare to do. Being afraid of wolves and tigers before and after, and being indecisive, one cannot move forward. On the other hand, it is also necessary to have a spirit of seeking truth, study hard, practice bravely, and work in a down-to-earth manner, that is, to pay attention to difficulties tactically. Only with revolutionary enthusiasm, without a spirit of seeking truth, being flashy but not practical, rough but not meticulous, superficial but not deep, beautiful ideals will become empty fantasies, only flowering but not bearing fruit. We despise imperialism strategically, regarding it as a paper tiger, because although it is temporarily powerful and scary, this is only temporary, it is bound to perish, and a paper tiger is its essence. Without such courage, being timid and demeaning ourselves, we cannot win the battle. However, when conducting a specific struggle with imperialism, we must pay attention to it tactically; every battle must be carefully considered, otherwise, we will be defeated. The same is true when attacking the fortress of science and technology. The secrets of nature will surely be revealed, and we will surely be able to climb the peaks of science and technology; but when solving each technical problem specifically, we must go through hard study and thousands of experiments. Therefore, we must promote revolutionary enthusiasm while promoting the spirit of seeking truth, preventing both short-sightedness and flashiness. The communist style is the unity of revolutionary enthusiasm and the spirit of seeking truth.
    Some people are afraid of promoting the communist style, advocating bold innovation and creation, and will make "showing off." "Showing off" cannot be opposed in general, it depends on what new things are shown and what different things are established. Separating from the leadership of the Party, deviating from the proletarian standpoint, showing bourgeois novelty and establishing capitalist differences to counter the spirit of the times, and dragging the development of history, is what we have always opposed. However, truth and error, advanced and backward, have always filled the history of human struggle, and revolutionaries must show communist novelty and establish communist differences, must establish advanced banners, strive for the upstream, and distinguish themselves from bourgeois ideology and from backward things, in order to lead the masses forward. This kind of showing off is what we need. Not holding high the revolutionary and advanced banner, clearly showing off, but with a vague direction, seeming right and wrong, will surely increase the enemy's spirit and destroy our own prestige. Struggle is inevitable, and the proletariat must show off. In the face of principled struggle, being hesitant, ambiguous, vague, or acting according to the wind, "following the crowd," and not daring to adhere to principles, is nothing more than fear of harming personal interests. Communists must thoroughly sweep away this kind of decadent vulgar habit, and in the face of right and wrong, have a clear-cut stand, clear love and hatred, and dare to hold high the revolutionary and advanced banner; in order to adhere to the truth, they have the spirit of daring to排众议, resist the countercurrent, and顶歪风, and even if they are temporarily isolated or even attacked, they will not be discouraged.
    Some people ask, is advocating daring to think and speak, daring to do and dare to do, breaking superstitions, and boldly creating, in opposition to believing in Marxism-Leninism and obeying organization and discipline? We say that they are consistent. Breaking superstitions does not mean not believing in anything or not obeying anything. Superstition is blindness based on ignorance of the laws of objective things, and it is anti-scientific. Breaking superstitions is precisely to establish a scientific attitude and truly believe in science and truth. The mistake of dogmatism does not lie in reading Marxism, but in turning Marxism into an unchanging dogma, abandoning the soul of Marxism, and violating the fundamental principle of combining Marxist theory with practice. Our breaking of the superstition of dogmatism is precisely to combine the universal truth of Marxism, which is applicable to all over the world, with the practice of China, and to summarize the experience of the masses and creatively develop Marxism. Breaking superstitions and abandoning dogmatism is truly respecting Marxism, not its opposite. Therefore, we must never confuse believing in truth and believing in science with superstition. To truly dare to say and dare to do, we must first guide our actions with Marxism, unswervingly obey the leadership of the Party, grasp the truth, and have the correct direction.
    Breaking superstitions, boldly innovating and creating, and obeying organization and observing discipline are also consistent. We communists have always opposed superstition. The Party has consistently adhered to the principle of closely combining the universal truth of Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution in its activities, and opposes dogmatism and empiricism; it has always taught communists and the people to treat their work with a creative attitude, contribute all their wisdom to their work, and give play to their revolutionary subjective initiative. Fully developing democracy and giving play to the creativity of the masses is not only not weakening but precisely consolidating discipline and consolidating centralized and unified leadership. In the great leap forward of socialist construction, the fact that the Party led 600 million people to give play to their creativity fully proves that bold creation is consistent with obeying the organization. As far as individual communists are concerned, guiding their actions with materialism and dialectics, they must respect the masses, respect the creativity of the masses, and work with the masses to obey the collective, so that individual wisdom can blossom and bear fruit in the great common cause. True communist heroes are collectivists. This, of course, requires obeying organization and observing discipline. Revolutionary discipline is precisely the condition for ensuring that communists are united and transform the world with collective power. Therefore, revolutionary heroism precisely requires a high degree of organization and discipline. The communist style requires being good at combining courageous innovation and creativity with a high degree of discipline. It is impossible to have true creation without being separated from the masses or from the collective.

    发扬共产主义风格
    侯铁萍
    党的八大二次会议，号召无产阶级和人民的战士“提倡坚决相信真理、坚决依靠群众、对于任何权威都无所畏惧的崇高风格”。这就是共产主义风格。我国人民在汹涌澎湃的社会主义建设大跃进浪潮里所表现的敢想敢说、敢做敢为、势如破竹、所向披靡的气概，也正是这种风格。
    每个时代，每个阶级都有自己的风格。共产主义风格是无产阶级党性的表现。在长夜漫漫，资本主义制度还处于上升阶段的时候，马克思和恩格斯就指出：资本主义制度必然灭亡，无产阶级一定要获得整个世界。当最黑暗的反动统治像大山一样压在中国人民头上的时候，中国共产党人就高举了胜利的红旗。无产阶级的先锋队，始终不管黑夜茫茫，不怕残酷的迫害和屠杀，彻底地同一切传统观念决裂，对各种偶像权威进行革命的批判，藐视一切表面上似乎无比强大的腐朽制度，以“让高山低头、河水让路”的气概，为无产阶级革命的胜利而顽强地战斗。
    现在，共产主义风格正在发扬光大为全民的风格。这是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是社会主义革命的精神之花。资产阶级思想、观点和习惯，是束缚人民的精神的锁链。唯名营利的追求，使人在精神上被捆住手脚，眼光短浅，革命意志衰退，整天无精打彩，消极被动；偶有点滴成绩，就骄气重重，不能“更上一层楼”；在是非面前，吞吞吐吐，态度暧昧，胆小如鼠，一片庸俗习气。任何人不去掉这种种歪风邪气的根子，就谈不上什么共产主义风格；不割掉个人主义这个毒癌，共产主义思想就不能扎根开花。要具有共产主义风格，就必须彻底同资产阶级的思想、观点决裂，灭掉资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，拔掉白旗，插上红旗，以共产主义人生观指导自己的行动。一切具有崇高风格的人，都是具有坚定的共产主义人生观、全心全意为人民服务的人。
    人民群众的共产主义风格的发扬，不但是无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想的结果，而且是唯物论和辩证法战胜主观主义和形而上学的结果。按照辩证唯物论的观点看来，客观事物永远在发展变化，新事物总要战胜旧事物，历史的发展永远是后来居上。一切科学、理论，都是概括人民群众生产斗争和阶级斗争实践的结果。当前我国六亿人民所进行的丰富卓绝的斗争，已经创造出了而且必然还会创造出无数奇迹，在科学和技术上一定会超越以往，“青出于蓝，更胜于蓝”。教条主义和经验主义者却脱离实际、脱离群众，主观主义和形而上学地对待客观世界发展的本来面目。以静止的、片面的观点观察生活中的问题，认识落后于实践的发展，见静不见动，见渐变不见突变，以保守的态度对待我国的社会主义事业，造成了种种迷信。迷信死人，迷信洋人，迷信资产阶级学者，迷信书本知识或狭隘的经验，把科学、技术神秘化，看不到解放了的中国人民蕴藏的无限创造能力，不相信人民群众的革命能动性。种种迷信束缚着他们的头脑，使他们充满无穷的恐惧和自卑，古人、洋人、学者没有说过的不敢说，没有做过的不敢做，头脑闭塞，妄自菲薄，甘拜下风。因此要具有崇高的风格，必须彻底抛弃那些闭塞人们头脑的各种自卑心理和迷信，破主观主义、经验主义和教条主义，坚决依靠群众，充分信任群众的创造能力，用唯物论、辩证法指导自己的行动。只有这样，才能志气昂扬，大胆地革新创造，把书上没有的我们写上，外国没有的我们创造出来，专家没有说过的我们说出来，世界上没有的东西我们创造出来，敢于攀登科学和技术的顶峰。
    具有共产主义风格，一方面，必须有炽烈的革命热情、革命勇气和胆量，在战略上敢于藐视困难，才能敢于设想前人所不敢想的事，做前人不敢做的事情。前怕狼后怕虎，扭扭捏捏，就不能前进。另一方面，还需要有求实的精神，刻苦钻研，勇敢实践，脚踏实地的干，也就是在战术上重视困难。只有革命热情，没有求实精神，华而不实，粗而不细，浮而不深，美好的理想就会变成空想，只开花不结果。我们在战略上藐视帝国主义，把它看做纸老虎，是因为它虽然暂时强大吓人，但这只是暂时的，它必然要灭亡，纸老虎正是它的本质。没有这样的勇气，怯敌自贬，就不能战而胜之。但是，和帝国主义进行具体斗争时，战术上必须重视它；每个战斗都要周密地考虑，否则，就会打败仗。在进攻科学、技术堡垒的时候，也是这样，自然的秘密一定会被揭开，我们在科学技术上一定能够攀登顶峰；但具体解决每个技术问题时，又必须经过刻苦钻研、千百次试验。因此，必须在发扬革命热情的同时，发扬求实精神，既防止眼光浅短，又防止华而不实。共产主义风格是革命热情和求实精神的统一。
    有人怕发扬共产主义风格，提倡大胆革新创造，会闹“标新立异”。“标新立异”是不能笼统反对的，要看标什么新、立什么异。脱离党的领导，脱离无产阶级立场，标资产阶级之新、立资本主义之异以与时代精神相抗衡，拖历史发展的后腿，是我们历来反对的。但是，真理和错误，先进和落后，始终充满人类斗争的历史，革命者必须标共产主义之新、立共产主义之异，必须树立先进的旗帜，力争上游，同资本主义思想区别开来，同落后的东西区别开来，才能率领群众前进。这种标新立异是我们需要的。不高举革命的先进的旗帜，鲜明地标新立异，而方向模糊，似是而非，就一定长敌人的锐气，灭自己的威风。斗争是不可避免的，无产阶级是必须标新立异的。在原则斗争面前，吞吞吐吐，摸棱两可，含糊敷衍，或看风办事，“随大流”，不敢坚持原则，无非是害怕伤害个人利益。共产主义者必须彻底扫除这种陈腐的庸俗习气，在是非面前，立场鲜明，爱憎分明，敢于高举革命的先进的旗帜；为了坚持真理，有敢于排众议，抗逆流，顶歪风的精神，即使暂时受到孤立甚至打击，也毫不灰心丧气。
    有人问，提倡敢想敢说，敢做敢为，破除迷信，大胆创造，同相信马克思列宁主义，同服从组织、服从纪律是否对立呢？我们说，这是一致的。破除迷信，并不是不相信任何东西，不服从任何东西。迷信是以对客观事物规律无知为基础的盲目性，是反科学的。破除迷信正是为了树立科学的态度，真正相信科学、相信真理。教条主义的错误并不在于读马克思主义，而是他们把马克思主义变成了万世不变的教条，抛弃了马克思主义的灵魂，违背了马克思主义理论同实践相结合的根本原则。我们破除教条主义的迷信，正是为了使马克思主义这一放之四海皆准的普遍真理同中国的实践结合起来，并总结群众的经验，创造性地发展马克思主义。破除迷信、抛弃教条主义是真正地尊重马克思主义，而不是它的反面。因此，决不能把相信真理、相信科学同迷信混同起来。要做到真正地敢说敢做，首先要以马克思主义指导自己的行动，坚定不移地服从党的领导，抓住真理，方向正确。
    破除迷信、大胆革新创造同服从组织、遵守纪律也是一致的。我们共产主义者历来是反对迷信的。党一贯在自己的活动中坚持马克思主义的普遍真理同中国革命实践密切结合的原则，反对教条主义和经验主义；始终教导共产党员和人民以创造性的态度对待自己的工作，在工作中贡献自己的一切智慧，发挥革命的主观能动性。充分发扬民主、发挥群众的创造性，不仅不是削弱而且正是巩固纪律、巩固集中统一领导的条件。在社会主义建设大跃进中，党领导六亿人民发挥创造性的事实，充分证明大胆创造同服从组织是一致的。就共产主义者个人说，以唯物论、辩证法指导自己的行动，就必须尊重群众，尊重群众的创造性，和群众一道，服从集体，才能使个人的智慧在伟大的共同事业中开花结果。真正的共产主义英雄，是集体主义者。这当然要服从组织、遵守纪律。革命的纪律正是保证共产主义者团结一致、以集体力量改造世界的条件。因此，革命的英雄气概，恰恰要求有高度的组织性纪律性。共产主义风格，正要求善于把勇敢革新的创造性同高度的纪律性结合起来，脱离群众、脱离集体是不可能有真正的创造的。
