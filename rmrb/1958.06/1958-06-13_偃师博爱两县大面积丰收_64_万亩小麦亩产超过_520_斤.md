    People's Daily, Zhengzhou, June 12th. (Reporter Qu Mingzhen) Reports: Yanshi and Bo'ai, two counties north and south of the Yellow River in Henan Province, have achieved large-scale bumper harvests of wheat, with yields exceeding 500 jin per mu. In Yanshi County, out of 368,547 mu of wheat, based on the actual yield of 50% of the harvested wheat and the categorized estimation of unharvested wheat, the total output can reach 196.8 million jin, with an average yield of 534 jin per mu, including 7,000 mu of high-yield fields producing over 1,000 jin. In Bo'ai County, located north of the Yellow River and east of the Taihang Mountains in Henan Province, the average yield of 273,915 mu of wheat this year is 520 jin per mu, with over 100,000 mu yielding 800 jin per mu.

    The common characteristics of this year's wheat in these two counties are large and long ears, numerous and plump grains, and dense and uniform distribution. Many experienced veteran farmers underestimated the yield. Yanshi County originally estimated the county's wheat yield to be 400 jin per mu, but after threshing, the actual yield exceeded the estimate by 134 jin. In the Danhe Irrigation Area of Bo'ai County, 105,000 mu of wheat was estimated to yield only about 500 jin per mu before the wheat harvest, but the actual yield reached 800 jin. At the same time, this county also saw two wheat production teams reaching 1,000 jin per mu and many large-scale high-yield records that people here had never dared to imagine in the past. According to statistics, the wheat high-yield fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu in the Chengnanguan, Daxindian, and Longwangmiao agricultural cooperatives alone amount to 1,320 mu. In the Xuwan Agricultural Cooperative of the Third District, a mountainous cooperative with barren land, the 1.4 mu wheat high-yield experimental plot cultivated by Comrade Cui Dequan, the district party committee secretary, together with the masses, completely exceeded people's expectations. The average yield per mu reached 1,450 jin, which is 1,200 jin more than last year's yield on this plot.

    Yanshi and Bo'ai are high-yield wheat counties in Henan Province. This year, the yield per unit area of wheat here has more than doubled. Among them, Yanshi County's production growth rate is the most prominent. Since liberation, wheat production in this county has increased year after year: in 1952, the average yield was 157.3 jin per mu, in 1955 it was 185 jin per mu, and in 1956 it was 262.4 jin per mu; last year, although it suffered a severe drought, the average yield per mu was still 228 jin, making it the county with the highest wheat yield in Henan. It still continues to lead the province.

    The important reason for the bumper wheat harvest in Yanshi and Bo'ai is the result of the hard work of the broad masses throughout the winter and spring after the nationwide rectification campaign and socialist great debate in the countryside. In terms of yield-increasing measures, they closely grasped timely and phased watering, applied sufficient base fertilizer and topdressing, deeply plowed the land, evenly sowed and densely planted, and waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, especially drought, wind, frost, and insects, to win an unprecedented bumper harvest. These facts and experiences of high yield once again prove that wheat production in high-yield areas can continue to leap forward.

### 偃师博爱两县大面积丰收  64万亩小麦亩产超过520斤

    偃师博爱两县大面积丰收
    64万亩小麦亩产超过520斤
    本报郑州12日电　记者曲明振报道：河南省黄河南北两岸出现了偃师、博爱两个亩产小麦五百斤以上的大面积丰产县。偃师全县三十六万八千五百四十七亩小麦，根据已打50％小麦的实产和未打小麦的分类估产，总产量可达一亿九千六百八十万斤，平均每亩产五百三十四斤，其中千斤以上的高额丰产田，共有七千亩。位于黄河以北、太行山以东的河南省博爱县今年二十七万三千九百一十五亩小麦平均亩产五百二十斤，并有十万多亩单产八百斤。
    这两个县今年小麦共同的特点，是穗大且长，籽多饱满，稠密均匀。许多有经验的老农在估产中都输了眼力。偃师县原来预计全县小麦亩产四百斤，经过打场，实际产量超过估产一百三十四斤。博爱县丹河灌溉区十万五千亩小麦，麦收前估计单产只五百来斤，结果达到八百斤。同时，这个县还出现两个小麦千斤社和许多过去这里人们连想都没有人敢想的大面积高额丰产纪录。据统计，仅城南关、大辛店和龙王庙三个农业社亩产千斤以上的小麦丰产田，就有一千三百二十亩之多。三区许湾农业社是一个土地瘠薄的山区社，今年当地区委书记崔德全同志在这社和群众一起搞的一亩四分小麦丰产试验田，收打情况完全出乎人们意料之外，平均亩产一千四百五十斤，比去年这块地每亩多收一千二百斤。
    偃师、博爱是河南省小麦高产县。今年这里的小麦单位面积产量都又增加了一倍以上。其中，偃师县产量增长速度最突出。这个县从解放以来，小麦连年增产：1952年平均每亩产一百五十七斤三两，1955年亩产一百八十五斤，1956年亩产二百六十二斤四两；去年虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，但平均每亩仍产二百二十八斤，成为河南小麦单产最高县。目前还是继续在全省领先。
    偃师、博爱小麦丰收的重要原因，是由于农村经过全民性的整风和社会主义大辩论，广大群众苦干一冬、大干一春的结果。在增产措施上，都是紧紧抓住了适时分期浇水，施足底肥、追肥、深翻土地，匀播密植，向自然灾害，特别是向旱、风、霜、虫进行了顽强的斗争，才赢得空前大丰收。这些丰产事实和经验再一次证明：高产地区小麦产量完全可以连续跃进。
