    Non-Venomous Snakes and Venomous Snakes

    Snakes are not as terrible and hateful as people imagine. Snakes eat field mice, sparrows, and insects. Although some venomous snakes can harm people, their venom is used to treat difficult diseases.
    According to investigations, there are over one hundred species of snakes in China, the majority of which are in the south of the Yangtze River. Not all of these snakes are venomous. The obvious difference between non-venomous and venomous snakes is that the head of a venomous snake is triangular and it has particularly long fangs in its mouth; the head of a non-venomous snake is oval and it does not have long fangs in its mouth.
    Common snakes can be identified by their shape and color to determine which are non-venomous and which are venomous.
    The *Dinodon rufozonatum*, also known as the red banded snake or red-spotted snake, has a black oval head, slightly flattened, with a very smooth body, dark red on the back and white on the abdomen. There is a "Y"-shaped pattern behind its head. This type of snake lives in fields and near villages, is fierce in nature, and often preys on frogs, lizards, and fish. In the past, medicine peddlers would use this snake as a venomous snake, letting it bite their arms to test the efficacy of the medicine they were selling. In fact, the *Dinodon rufozonatum* is a non-venomous snake.
    There is also a type of snake that opens its mouth and makes a "whooshing" sound when touched; this is the *Elaphe taeniura*, also known as the yellow long snake. Its back is olive-colored with four black longitudinal stripes, the back of the tail is yellow, the head is brownish-yellow, and there is a black eyebrow-like stripe on its cheek. This is also a non-venomous snake.
    In damp places in the mountains and forests, one can often see a green snake. This snake has large eyes, a smooth body, grass-green on the back, and light yellowish-green on the abdomen. This snake eats earthworms and insects, is non-venomous, and has a gentle temperament, and does not bite people.
    Venomous snakes include the *Bungarus multicinctus*, the *Deinagkistrodon acutus*, the cobra, the *Gloydius shedaoensis*, and the green bamboo viper, etc. The *Bungarus multicinctus* has a black body, a white abdomen with a grayish-black tinge, a smooth body, a prominent row of scales in the center of the back, small eyes, and a slender, pointed tail. Some places call this snake the "silver retribution" or "white chrysanthemum." The mortality rate after a person is bitten by it is over 25%.
    The *Deinagkistrodon acutus*, also known as the five-step snake, has a large, triangular head. The back is grayish-brown, with inverted "V"-shaped large spots on both sides, and the abdomen is yellowish-white. This snake is extremely venomous, and if a person is bitten carelessly, it can be life-threatening.
    There is a type of snake that often lives in caves in walls near the water and is often active at night. The head and neck of this snake are about the same size, and its most obvious characteristic is a pair of black-centered, white-edged spectacle-like markings on its neck. This is the most dangerous venomous snake—the cobra, also known as the "flat-headed wind."
    The *Gloydius shedaoensis* is also a venomous snake. In some places, it is also called the "seven-inch snake" or "earth father snake." The head is triangular, the back is dark brown, with a row of blackish-brown circular spots on each side of the body, the top of the head is grayish-brown, and there is a thick black band from behind the eye to the corner of the mouth.
    People who live in mountainous forests often encounter the green bamboo viper (also called the bamboo leaf green snake). This snake has a grass-green back, a greenish-green head, and a light yellow abdomen, and lives in mountainous and forested areas. This snake's tail can wrap around tree branches and is suitable for living in trees; it is also a venomous snake.
    Once you know the venomous snakes, you must take precautions against snake bites. If you are bitten by a venomous snake, you should see a doctor immediately. Before the doctor arrives, you should give first aid, immediately tying the area of the wound closest to the body tightly to prevent the venom from flowing through the whole body, and opening the wound to apply some potassium permanganate for disinfection. People who work in the countryside should carry some snake medicine with them in case of emergency.

    无毒蛇与有毒蛇
    胡声
    蛇并不如人们所想像的那样可怕可恨。蛇会吃田野的老鼠、麻雀和昆虫，有些毒蛇虽然会伤害人，但是它的毒液却被人们利用来治疗难治的疾病。
    据调查，我国有一百多种蛇，绝大部分都在江南。这些蛇并不都是有毒的。无毒蛇和有毒蛇明显的区别是：毒蛇的头部是三角形，口里有特别长的毒牙；无毒蛇的头部是椭圆形，口里没有长的毒牙。
    常见的蛇，可以从它的形状、体色来识别哪些是无毒，哪些是有毒的。
    火赤链蛇，又叫赤链蛇、红斑蛇。它的头是黑色椭圆形，稍扁一点，身体很光滑，背上是暗红色，腹面是白色。头后面有个像“丫”字形的纹。这种蛇生活在田野和村庄附近，性情凶暴，常捕食青蛙、蜥蜴和鱼。过去走江湖卖药的人，把这种蛇当作毒蛇，使它咬伤自己的手臂，来检验自己所售药的灵效。其实，火赤链蛇是一种没有毒的蛇。
    还有一种蛇，一触动它，就张开嘴巴，发出“呼呼”的声音，这就是黑眉锦蛇，又叫黄长虫。它的背面呈橄榄色，有四条黑色纵纹，尾巴的背面是黄色，头部褐黄色，面颊上有一条像黑眉状的黑色斑纹。这也是一种无毒蛇。
    在山林阴湿的地方，常常可以见到一种青蛇。这种蛇的眼睛很大，身体光滑，背面是草绿色，腹面淡黄绿色。这种蛇吃蚯蚓和昆虫，是无毒蛇，性情温顺，不会咬人。
   毒蛇有眼环蛇、百步蛇、眼镜蛇、腹蛇、青竹蛇等。眼环蛇，身体黑色，腹面白色而又带灰黑色，全身光滑，背中央有一行显著的鳞片，眼睛细小，尾巴细长而尖。有些地方把这种蛇叫银报应、白菊花。人被它咬伤后，死亡率达25％以上。
    百步蛇，也叫五步蛇，头大，呈三角形。背面灰褐色，两侧有倒“V”字形的大斑纹，腹面黄白色。这种蛇毒性非常剧烈，人不慎被咬有生命危险。
    有一种蛇常栖息在水边墙垣洞穴中，常在夜晚出来活动。这种蛇的头和颈大小差不多，它最明显的标志是颈部有一对白边黑心的眼镜状斑纹，这就是顶厉害的毒蛇——眼镜蛇，又叫“扁头风”。
    腹蛇也是毒蛇。也有的地方叫七寸子、土公蛇。头部呈三角形，背面暗褐色，身体两边各有一行黑褐色圆形斑纹，头顶灰褐色，从眼后到口角处有一条很粗的黑带。
    住在山区森林里的人，常常会遇到青竹蛇（也有叫竹叶青蛇）。这蛇的背面草绿色，头部青绿色，腹面淡黄色，栖息在山野及森林地带。这种蛇的尾巴可以缠绕树枝，适于树上生活，也是一种毒蛇。
    认识了毒蛇，就要注意防备毒蛇咬伤。如果不慎被毒蛇咬伤，要马上请医生，在医生没来以前要进行急救，立即将伤口近身体的那一边缚紧，不让毒液流串全身，并且把伤口拨开，涂上些高锰酸钾消毒。在农村工作的人，到野外工作时最好带上一点蛇药，以防万一。
