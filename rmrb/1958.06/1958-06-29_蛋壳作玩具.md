Eggshells as Toys
Many people, when cooking, crack eggshells on the edge of a bowl and throw them away, which is a pity. Actually, eggshells can be made into small toys for children.

(1) Fake Egg: If you carefully drill a small hole at the pointed end of the egg, vigorously pour out the egg white and yolk. Wash the inside of the eggshell with water, then put in fine sand. Then seal the small opening with paper and glue, and you have a fake egg.

(2) Tumbler: After making the eggshell as described above, if you only put in a small amount of sand and mud, seal the opening, and use colors to paint the face of a child or an old man on the pointed end of the egg, it can become an interesting tumbler. (Figure 1)

(3) Small Bucket: Break the eggshell at the slightly pointed end, making a hole with a diameter of about 1.5 centimeters. After pouring out the yolk and white, smooth the edges. Then tie a string to the center of a matchstick of suitable length, insert it vertically, and then place the matchstick horizontally inside the eggshell. You can then lift it up, and it becomes a delicate small bucket. (Figure 2)

(4) Small Vase: Put a little soil inside the eggshell, insert a paper flower, and place it on a desk, and you have a precious small vase. (Figure 3)

    蛋壳作玩具
    许多人做菜的时候，噼啪一声就把鸡蛋壳在碗边敲碎了，真是可惜。其实可以把鸡蛋壳做成小玩意给小孩子玩。
    （一）假鸡蛋　如果小心地在鸡蛋的尖端钻一个小孔，把鸡蛋清和鸡蛋黄用力倒出来。用水洗净蛋壳里面，然后放进细砂子。再用纸和胶水把小口封上，就是一个假鸡蛋了。
    （二）不倒翁　照上述作成的鸡蛋壳，如果只放进少许砂泥，封上口，用颜色在蛋尖端画上小孩或老太爷脸谱等，就可以成为一个有趣的不倒翁。（图一）
    （三）小水桶　从鸡蛋稍尖的一端敲破，洞口直径长约1.5厘米，把蛋黄蛋清倒出后，把边缘修整。然后用线绑在一根长短合适的火柴棍中央，垂直放入，然后把火柴棍横在蛋壳内就可以提起来，便成为一个玲珑的小水桶了。（图二）
    （四）小花瓶　鸡蛋壳内装一点泥土，插上一枝纸花，放在书桌上，就是一个名贵的小花瓶了。（图三）
