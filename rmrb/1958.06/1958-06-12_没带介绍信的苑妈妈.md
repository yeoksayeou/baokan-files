    Mother Yuan Without an Introduction Letter
    Lieutenant of the People's Liberation Army Zeng Dehe
    May 27th, noon. The sun baked the ground until it was scorching. The tents on the construction site were as hot as steamers.
    "Is this the headquarters?" Suddenly, an old woman, panting, stepped into the construction site office. She was not tall, had a plump body, and was covered in sweat.
    "This is the political department of the headquarters. Do you need something, madam?" I replied while inviting her to sit down and have a drink of water.
    "I'm here to do labor. Assign me a place!"
    "You're old, just take a look around!"
    "Don't you believe me because I don't have an introduction letter?" As she spoke, she wrote in my notebook:
    "Former Deputy Director of the Beijing Acupuncture Clinic, Communist Party member, fifty-seven years old, retired last year, residing at No. 55, Beierlizhuang, Dongzhimen Outer - Yuan Mo'an."
    Seeing that I was a soldier, Mother Yuan kindly told me that her eldest daughter was an active-duty soldier. Her second daughter had recently transferred from the army to work at the Datong Municipal Health Bureau and was currently participating in the construction of the Yunih River Reservoir in Datong.
    "Why did you come alone, Mom?" It turned out that this was a military family member, which made me respect her from the bottom of my heart.
    From Mother Yuan's narration, the story was like this:
    Not long after the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir began, Mother Yuan, who loved labor, requested to come and work several times. The leadership, in order to take care of her health, did not agree. Later, her second daughter sent a letter back from the Datong Yunih River Reservoir, with a newspaper attached. Mother Yuan opened the newspaper and was so excited that she almost shed tears. It turned out that she was working very well at the reservoir construction site and was praised by the Datong Daily.
    On May 26th, the news that Chairman Mao had come to the Ming Tombs Reservoir to participate in labor spread, and Mother Yuan became even more excited. She thought, "Our beloved leader Chairman Mao is going to work! How can I stay at home? The world-famous Ming Tombs Reservoir, and I haven't even shoveled a shovelful of soil, how can I live with myself?"
    The next day, Mother Yuan came to the construction site.
    I helped Mother Yuan cross three light railways and walked closer to the dam. As I was introducing her to Bi Shumo, a squad leader of a certain PLA unit, Mother Yuan had already picked up a shovel and was shoveling gravel with the soldiers.
    Five o'clock. I repeatedly persuaded Mother Yuan to go back earlier, but she always said, "It's still early, let me work a little longer!" On the way back, she also took the time to shovel soil with the female soldiers.
    The public bus slowly disappeared in the distance of the construction site. Mother Yuan Mo'an left an indelible impression on the hearts of the Ming Tombs Reservoir builders.

    没带介绍信的苑妈妈
    人民解放军中尉　曾德和
    5月27日中午，太阳晒得地皮发焦。工地的帐篷里，热得像蒸笼一样。
    “是指挥部吗？”忽然一个老妈妈气喘喘地跨进工地办公室。她个子不高，身体胖胖的，满头大汗。
    “是指挥部政治部。老妈妈有事吗？”我边答复着边请她坐下来喝水。
    “我是来劳动的，指给我个地方吧！”
    “你老人家这么大年纪，就参观参观吧！”
    “没有介绍信，你不相信我吗？”说着她就在我的笔记本上写着：
    “原北京市针灸门诊部副所长，共产党员，五十七岁，去年退休，住东直门外北二里庄五十五号——苑默庵。”
    苑妈妈见我是军人，亲切地告诉我，她的大女儿是现役军人。二女儿不久从部队转业到大同市卫生局工作，现在正在大同参加修建淤泥河水库。
    “妈妈你为什么自个儿来呢？”原来这是位军属妈妈，使我从心眼里对她尊敬起来。
    从苑妈妈的叙述里，事情原来是这样：
    十三陵水库开工不久，热爱劳动的苑妈妈几次请求来劳动。领导上为了照顾她的身体，没有同意。后来，她的二女儿从大同淤泥河水库寄回来一封信，信里附了一张报纸。苑妈妈打开报纸一看，兴奋得几乎掉下泪来。原来她在水库工地上劳动很好，受到大同日报的表扬。
    5月26日，毛主席到十三陵水库参加劳动的消息传开了，苑妈妈更加激动起来，她想：“我们敬爱的领袖毛主席都去劳动啦！我怎么能老呆在家里？名扬世界的十三陵水库，我连一锹土都没铲，问得过心吗？”
    第二天，苑妈妈就到工地来了。
    我搀着苑妈妈穿过三条轻便铁道，走近拦河大坝。当我正向解放军某部班长毕书模介绍时，苑妈妈早已拿起铁锹和战士们一起铲开砂砾料了。
    五点钟了。我几次劝苑妈妈早些回去，她总是说：“还早，再劳动一会儿！”回来的路上，她又抽空和女战士们一块拿着锹，铲起土来。
    公共汽车慢慢地在工地的远方消失了。苑默庵妈妈在水库建设者们的心上留下了不可磨灭的印象。
