From Farmhand to Welding Expert

Kenska was awarded the title of Socialist Labor Hero for his work in constructing the Marx Hydroelectric Station on the Mati River. He is a well-known welding expert in Albania.

This welding expert came from a peasant background. His journey from poor peasant, farmhand to welding expert and labor hero has been a long and arduous one of struggle. It was back in 1935 when Kenska's family was forced to leave their small plot of land in the Korçë region and flee to the vicinity of Tirana. There, Kenska became a farmhand. Several years later, when the fascist invaders occupied his homeland, he joined the guerrillas and engaged in a staunch struggle to defend his country.

In 1945, the Albanian people gained their freedom and began to build a new socialist life. At this time, Kenska was determined to learn a professional skill and contribute more to the construction of his country. He chose welding. In the beginning, people said to him: "You don't even understand the slightest technical knowledge, and your education is so low. It won't be easy to master welding." Kenska ignored these remarks. He brought out the drive he had in the guerrilla war and persisted in learning for three years. Afterwards, he learned while working, and quickly surpassed ordinary workers, becoming a renowned and skilled welder.

Kenska's wish was realized: Albania's famous major projects, such as the Tirana Stalin Textile Factory and the Marx Hydroelectric Station, all have his contribution. Moreover, during the construction of the Marx Hydroelectric Station, his outstanding achievements made him a hero on the labor front. His spirit of diligent study and selfless labor for socialist construction has won the respect of his comrades. Many young workers take him as an example. They say that Kenska's life is a battle. He treats learning and work like fighting a war, holding a belief in certain victory and fearing no difficulties. As a result, some seemingly impossible things have been accomplished by him, and accomplished excellently.

    从雇农到电焊能手
    肯斯卡在建筑麦蒂河上的马克思水电站时，荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号，他是阿尔巴尼亚著名的电焊能手。
    这位电焊能手是农民出身。他从贫农、雇农到电焊能手和劳动英雄，走过了一段艰苦斗争的漫长的道路。那还是1935年的事，那时，肯斯卡一家人被迫离开了在科尔奇州的一小块土地，逃荒到了地拉那附近。在那里，肯斯卡就当了雇农。几年以后，当法西斯侵略者占领了他的祖国的时候，他加入了游击队，为保卫祖国而进行了坚强的斗争。
    1945年，阿尔巴尼亚人民获得了自由，开始建设社会主义的新生活。这时，肯斯卡就一心想学会一种专业技术，为建设自己的国家贡献更大的力量。他选择了电焊。开始时人们说他：“你连一点技术知识都不懂，文化又那么低，想掌握电焊可不容易。”肯斯卡不管这些，他拿出打游击战的干劲，坚持学习了三年。以后就边作边学，很快地超过了一般工人，成为有名的熟练电焊工。
    肯斯卡的愿望实现了：阿尔巴尼亚著名的大工程，像地拉那斯大林纺织厂和马克思水电站，都有他的一份劳动。而且在建设马克思水电站时，他的优秀成绩使他成为了劳动战线上的英雄。他这种刻苦钻研、为社会主义建设忘我劳动的精神，博得了同伴们的敬爱。许多青年工人都拿他作为榜样。他们说，肯斯卡的生活就是战斗，他对待学习、对待工作，都像打仗一样，抱着必胜的信心，不怕任何困难。结果，一些看来办不到的事都被他办成了，而且办得很出色。
