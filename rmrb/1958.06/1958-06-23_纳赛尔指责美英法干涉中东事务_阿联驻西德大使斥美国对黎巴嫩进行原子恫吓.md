Xinhua News Agency dispatch: President Nasser accused the United States, Britain, and France on the evening of the 21st of interfering in Middle Eastern affairs. Nasser said, "In the past few weeks, we have been subjected to accusations by certain major powers, accusations from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The purpose of their accusations is merely to justify their interference; they want to re-enter this region in order to carry out conspiracies and rule those countries that wish to complete their independence and have their own independent policies." He was clearly referring to the Lebanese crisis.

Speaking of the efforts needed to defend freedom, Nasser said that conspiracies would only strengthen resistance and strengthen the ability to safeguard hard-won independence.

The Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to Bonn, Farid Zeineddine, issued a statement at a press conference on the 21st, urging world public opinion to pay attention to the serious situation in the Middle East caused by the Western countries' interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

He said he had evidence to prove that pilots from the United States, Britain, Iraq, and Jordan were involved in the internal conflict in Lebanon and that their planes had bombed Beirut, Tripoli, and southeastern Lebanon.

Zeineddine accused Western countries, especially the United States, of pushing the situation in Lebanon to the "brink of war," possibly on a large scale, in order to support Chamoun, who is opposed by the Lebanese people.

Zeineddine said that the participation of American military aircraft in the war would trigger a global atomic war. He said this was in response to a statement made by U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy, who had said that if the United States were "forced" to intervene in Lebanon's internal affairs, it would send atomic bombers to Lebanon.

The statement emphasized that, given the increasingly serious situation, the Lebanese people would ask all Arab countries to send volunteers, and in this case, it would be difficult for the Arab people not to help their Lebanese brothers.

The Undersecretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic, Khalil and Fahmy, received on the 21st diplomatic envoys of all countries stationed in the United Arab Republic except the United States and Iraq, expressing the Arab Republic's views on the development of the situation in Lebanon. During the meeting, they told the diplomatic envoys that any foreign interference in Lebanon's internal affairs would cause extremely serious consequences.

Cairo and Damascus newspapers published editorials on the 21st condemning the U.S. Secretary of Defense's remarks about using atomic bombs in the Middle East.

Cairo's "Al-Gomhouria" said that this shows that the United States is openly and seriously threatening world peace with its imperialist policy towards the Middle East. This approach by the United States is not only a challenge to the Lebanese people and the Middle Eastern people, but also a challenge to the people of the world and world peace. "Al-Shaab" said that this threat is intended to intimidate the Lebanese people and the Arab people, as well as all free people. However, this threat cannot influence the people of the Arab countries, just as similar threats in the past have not deterred the Korean people and the Indochinese people's struggle against imperialism.

Damascus's "Sawt al-Arab" said in its editorial: "The U.S. Secretary of Defense's intimidation can only prove that the United States has gone mad and that it has no way to maintain its influence in the Middle East except by using force."

### 纳赛尔指责美英法干涉中东事务  阿联驻西德大使斥美国对黎巴嫩进行原子恫吓

    纳赛尔指责美英法干涉中东事务
    阿联驻西德大使斥美国对黎巴嫩进行原子恫吓
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：纳赛尔总统21日晚上指责美英法三国干涉中东事务。纳赛尔说，“过去几星期中，某些大国对我们滥加指责，我们受到美国、联合王国和法国的指责。它们指责的目的只是要说明他们的干涉有理；它们想重新进入这个地区，以便施展阴谋，统治那些希望完成他们的独立和有着他们自己独立的政策的国家”。他这番话指的显然是黎巴嫩危机。
    纳赛尔讲到保卫自由所需要进行的努力，他说，阴谋只会加强抵抗，加强保障得来不易的独立的能力。
    阿拉伯联合共和国驻波恩大使法里德·宰尼丁21日在记者招待会上发表声明促请世界舆论注意由于西方国家干涉黎巴嫩内政在中东引起的严重局势。
    他说，他握有证据，足以证明美国、英国、伊拉克和约旦的驾驶员卷入了黎巴嫩的内部冲突，他们的飞机轰炸了贝鲁特、的黎波里和黎巴嫩东南部。
    宰尼丁指责西方国家，特别是美国，为了支持黎巴嫩人民所反对的夏蒙，正在把黎巴嫩局势引向可能是大规模的“战争的边缘”。
    宰尼丁说，美国军用飞机参战将会触发一场世界性的原子战争。他说他这是针对美国国防部部长麦克耳罗伊发表的声明说的。麦克耳罗伊曾经说，如果美国“被迫”干预黎巴嫩内政的话，美国将把原子轰炸机派到黎巴嫩去。
    声明着重指出，鉴于局势日趋严重，黎巴嫩人民会要求所有的阿拉伯国家派遣志愿军，而在这种情况下，阿拉伯人民将很难不给予他们的黎巴嫩弟兄以帮助。
    阿拉伯联合共和国外交部次长哈利勒和法米21日接见了除美国和伊拉克以外的所有国家的驻阿拉伯联合共和国外交使节，表达阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩局势发展的看法。他们在会见中对外交使节们说，对黎巴嫩内政的任何外国干涉都将会引起极其严重的后果。
    开罗和大马士革报纸21日都发表社论，谴责美国国防部长表示要在中东使用原子弹的谈话。
    开罗“共和国报”说，这表明美国正在公然以它对中东的帝国主义政策严重威胁世界和平。美国这种做法不仅是向黎巴嫩人民和中东人民挑战，而且也是向全世界人民和世界和平挑战。“人民报”说，这种威胁的目的是要威吓黎巴嫩人民和阿拉伯人民以及一切自由人民。但是，这种威胁并不能影响阿拉伯各国人民，正像过去的类似威胁并没有吓倒朝鲜人民和印度支那人民的反对帝国主义的斗争一样。
    大马士革“阿拉伯之声报”在它的社论中说：“美国国防部长的恐吓只能证明美国已经神经错乱，证明它除了使用武力以外已经没有办法在中东保持它的影响了。”
