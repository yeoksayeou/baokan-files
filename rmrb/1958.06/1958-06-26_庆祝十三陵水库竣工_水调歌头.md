    Celebrating the Completion of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir
    "Shui Diao Ge Tou"
    Li Jishen

    Red flags are planted everywhere, planted on the Thirteen Tombs.
    Building a reservoir to prevent floods, eliminating harm and enriching people's lives.
    Irrigating tens of thousands of acres of fertile land, expanding the famous scenic spots of the capital, everyone expresses sympathy;
    Volunteering to work, leaders share the glory.
    Citizens, students, workers, peasants, and soldiers, gather into a sea of people, foreign envoys participate in the project.
    Following the glorious route, with soaring energy, celebrating the success in May.
    Leap forward and create miracles, to teach the world to be amazed!

    庆祝十三陵水库竣工
    水调歌头
    李济深遍地红旗插，插上十三陵。兴筑防洪水库，除害裕民生。灌溉良田万顷，扩展首都名胜，个个表同情；义务争劳动，领袖与光荣。市民们，员生队，工农兵，汇成人海，友邦使节预工程。循着辉煌路线，鼓足冲天干劲，五月庆功成。飞跃创奇绩，从教举世惊！
