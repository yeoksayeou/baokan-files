Saifudin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Autonomous Region, Dabashen, Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, and Soviet experts who assisted Xinjiang in developing its petroleum industry attended the opening ceremony.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Museum is the most magnificent building in Karamay. Inside the museum is a club that can accommodate 1,200 people. The first and second floors have recreation and reading rooms for employees, and the third floor is an exhibition hall displaying the deeds of Soviet experts in helping Xinjiang develop its petroleum industry over the past seven years. In the past seven years, Xinjiang has used more than 240,000 tons of equipment and materials supplied by the Soviet Union to equip geological exploration, drilling, oil extraction, and refining departments. The Soviet Union has also sent more than 500 experts to help Xinjiang petroleum workers find more than 120 oil-bearing structures in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, discovered the Karamay oil field, and trained more than 900 technical cadres and more than 1,000 technical workers. This sincere and selfless assistance from the Soviet government and people has enabled Xinjiang's petroleum industry construction to achieve tremendous achievements in just a few years.

    纪念苏联对新疆石油工业的援助
    克拉玛依建立中苏友谊馆
    新华社克拉玛依电　为纪念苏联对新疆石油工业的巨大援助而在克拉玛依兴建的中苏友谊馆23日下午隆重举行开馆典礼。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记、自治区主席赛福鼎，苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事达巴申，以及帮助新疆发展石油工业的苏联专家，都前来参加开馆典礼。
    中苏友谊馆是克拉玛依最宏伟的一座建筑物。馆内有能容纳一千二百人的俱乐部，一楼和二楼设有职工游艺室和阅览室，三楼是陈列苏联专家七年来帮助新疆发展石油工业事迹的展览馆。在过去七年中，新疆用苏联供应我国的二十四万多吨设备和器材，装备了地质勘探、钻井、采油和炼油部门。苏联还先后派来五百多名专家，帮助新疆石油职工在天山南北找到了一百二十多个储油构造，发现了克拉玛依大油田，并培养了九百多名技术干部，一千多名技术工人。苏联政府和人民对我国这种真诚无私的援助，使新疆石油工业建设在短短的几年内取得了巨大的成就。
