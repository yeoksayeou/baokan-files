Everywhere the Sound of Gurgling Water
    ——Talking about the Xiangyang Special District's Muskmelon Vine-style Self-Flow Irrigation Network
    By our reporters Fang Di, Luo Chongzhang

The attendees of the Southern Region Water Conservancy Work Conference were very interested in the muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network established in Xiangyang Special District during their visit to the area's water conservancy construction. People generally believe that this is a creative measure in water conservancy construction and represents a direction for water conservancy construction in mountainous and hilly areas.

What is the muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network? Simply put, it is an irrigation network that primarily utilizes river water, "drawing water from afar to irrigate fields nearby," and "storing water in slack times to irrigate fields during busy times." The method of establishing this irrigation network is as follows: After comprehensive surveys and unified planning, mobilize the masses to build dams section by section along the rivers, carve channels around the mountains, and build ponds, weirs, and reservoirs around the channels, connecting them together to draw river water to irrigate the channels, channel water to irrigate the ponds, weirs, and reservoirs, and pond water, weir water, and reservoir water to irrigate the fields. Because this irrigation network irrigates the fields using self-flow methods, and its shape resembles a muskmelon vine with a large number of muskmelons – the dams are like "melon roots," the irrigation channels are like "melon vines," and the ponds, weirs, and reservoirs are like the "melons" that grow – people call it the muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network.

This kind of muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network can be seen almost everywhere in Xiangyang Special District, and it is constantly developing towards a more perfect stage. Many such examples can be given: Along the Guanshan River in Jun County, fourteen crisscrossing channels have now been built. Around them are many ponds, weirs, and reservoirs, and these ponds, weirs, and reservoirs are connected to the main channels and fields through many small channels, forming a very large network. But people are still adding channels, ponds, weirs, and reservoirs to continue expanding the network. People use "Vines climbing throughout the township, melons growing all over the land" to describe the scale of this network. The masses in various places are very interested in this irrigation network and have written many poems to sing its praises and commend it. Members of the Huohua Cooperative in Hualishu Township, Jun County, sang: "Reservoirs connected to channels, channels connected to ponds, paddy fields changed to barren slopes; rivers diverted, embankments built, thousand-year river beaches transformed into fertile fields." A poem by farmers in Shangshi Township, Sui County, reads: "A great breakthrough in vision, a great innovation, centuries of drought swept away; channels like dragons across the fields, the sound of gurgling water everywhere."

The biggest feature of the muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network is that, because it combines channels and rivers, and combines ponds, weirs, reservoirs, and channels, it can achieve a reliable water source, regulation, and a high utilization rate. In the past, there were also a considerable number of ponds, weirs, and reservoirs here, but they were isolated from each other and did not have a reliable water source. Often, in times of drought, within a few days of the fields drying up, the ponds, weirs, and reservoirs would also quickly run out of water. The muskmelon vine-style irrigation network completely avoids this shortcoming because: it can use the constant flow of river water to irrigate ponds, weirs, and reservoirs. When it rains, the runoff from the catchment area can also irrigate ponds, weirs, and reservoirs; at the same time, because the channels and ponds, weirs, etc., are connected to each other, it can also expand the catchment area. In this way, it can store the water that is not used, making it possible to "store water in slack times and use it during busy times," allowing small ponds, weirs, and reservoirs to play a big role.

Another major feature of this new type of irrigation network is that its construction is simple, the technology is easy, the investment is small, and it can be built quickly. Because the so-called damming of rivers, except for a very small number of larger rivers, is mostly very easy to do. Some streams with higher water levels can even draw water from the riverbank by opening channels without building dams. The construction of channels and small ponds, weirs, and reservoirs is also simple and easy; especially channels, which are very labor-saving, and a channel can be dug in a few days. Wherever the channel is dug, water can flow. At the same time, with such a network, existing abandoned ponds and weirs can also be repaired and utilized. As for surveying and design, except for some larger channels and river dams, it is generally relatively easy.

What do these situations illustrate? It shows that establishing a muskmelon vine-style irrigation network can fully achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. And the facts in this special district last winter and this spring can fully prove this point. According to statistics, this special district, with just over five million people, completed more than 130,000 projects of various sizes during the aforementioned period, of which the total length of the channels reached 130,000 li, as long as a dozen Yangtze Rivers. Numerous dams have been built on hundreds of rivers of various sizes throughout the district; the channels on both banks are as dense as spider webs; and various ponds, weirs, and reservoirs are like stars in the sky. It is precisely because these projects are highly effective that this special district increased its paddy fields from the original three million mu to more than seven million mu in a few months, and also expanded the irrigated land by 1.6 million mu; and these paddy fields and irrigated land were previously low-yielding mountain slopes, river beaches, and uncultivated wasteland. In addition to these newly added paddy fields and irrigated land, the irrigation conditions for 2.7 million mu of cultivated land in the district have been improved. Whether viewed from the amount of work completed or the area benefited, last winter and this spring increased many times compared to the previous winter and spring, but the investment decreased by more than one-third compared to the previous winter and spring. Many projects were built with only a few cents to a few yuan of kerosene lamp expenses.

The muskmelon vine-style self-flow irrigation network in Xiangyang Special District is the product of the district's leaders at all levels grasping the masses' demands for increased production and the key to achieving increased production, and leading the masses to launch a large-scale water conservancy construction campaign. At the same time, it is also the product of the district's leaders at all levels vividly implementing the water conservancy construction policy of "storage as the main focus, small-scale as the main focus, and cooperative management as the main focus." Countless facts prove that establishing such a water conservancy irrigation network is only possible with a large-scale mass movement; and only by grasping the masses' demands for increased production and the key to achieving increased production, while also adopting the "three main focus" policy that is easily accepted by the masses, can a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement be formed.

Xiangyang is a low-yielding area. Before liberation, the average grain yield per mu in the entire district was only over 200 jin, and only over 100 jin in the large mountainous areas. At that time, the masses lived a hard life, "half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain"; some areas were still "eight months of sweet potatoes, four months of pumpkins." After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, a large-scale production movement was launched, and grain yields increased year by year, reaching an average of over 300 jin per mu last year. However, compared with most special districts in the province, it is still low-yielding. This is mainly because there is more dry land and less paddy land. Of the 15 million mu of cultivated land in the district, only 2 million mu were paddy fields at the time of liberation, and most of them were not guaranteed harvests; after several years of expansion, it only reached 3 million mu last year. Facts over the years have proved that after converting dry land into paddy fields, the yield can be increased by more than half, and the masses say that "one irrigation is worth three droughts." Converting to paddy fields is the key measure to increase production, and the key to converting to paddy fields is to build water conservancy projects. In this way, the leaders of Xiangyang Special District firmly grasped this key, mobilized the masses to build large-scale water conservancy projects, and conscientiously implemented the "three main focus" policy; they vigorously promoted the experiences and creations of the masses in implementing this policy by means of visits and comparisons, and criticized conservative ideas. Thus, a large-scale water conservancy movement was launched. And the muskmelon vine-style irrigation network was summarized and promoted throughout the district based on the creations of the masses in the movement.

    到处潺潺流水声
    ——谈襄阳专区的西瓜秧式自流灌溉网
    本报记者　方堤　罗重璋
    南方地区水利工作会议的与会者在参观襄阳专区的水利建设的时候，对那里建立起来的西瓜秧式自流灌溉网很感兴趣。人们普遍地认为这是水利建设中的一项创造性的措施，是山区和丘陵区进行水利建设的方向。
    什么是西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网呢？简单地说，这是一种以利用河水为主，“远处引水，近处灌田”，“闲时蓄水，忙时灌田”的灌溉网。建立这种灌溉网的方法是：经过全面勘测，统一规划后，发动群众节节拦河筑坝，盘山开渠，在渠道周围修建塘、堰、水库，并使它们相连结起来，以便引河水灌渠，引渠水灌塘、堰、水库，引塘水、堰水、库水灌田。因为这种灌溉网是用自流的方法灌田的，而外形又很像结有大量西瓜的西瓜秧——拦水坝好比“瓜根”，引水渠好比“瓜秧”，塘、堰、库好比结的“西瓜”，所以人们就叫它是西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网。
    这种西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网在襄阳专区几乎到处都能看到，而且它们还在不断地向着更完善的阶段发展着。可以举出许多这样的例子：沿着均县官山河，现在已经建起纵横交错的十四条渠，它们的周围有许许多多塘、堰、水库，而这些塘、堰、水库又通过许多小渠与干渠和田连在一起，已形成为一个十分庞大的网了。但人们还在加渠、加塘、加堰、加库，使网继续扩大。人们用“秧爬全乡，瓜结满地”来形容这个网的规模。各地群众对这种灌溉网很感兴趣，曾作了大量的诗来歌颂、赞扬它。均县花栗树乡火花社的社员们歌唱道：“库连渠，渠连塘，水田改到荒坡上；移河道，筑堤岸，千年河滩变良田。”随县尚市乡农民的诗歌中有这样一首：“大破眼界大革新，百年旱灾一扫清；渠道如龙横遍野，到处潺潺流水声。”
    西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网的最大特色是：由于它把渠道和河结合了起来，把塘、堰、水库、渠道结合起来，因而能作到有水源、有调节、有很高的利用率。以往，这里也有相当数量的塘、堰、水库，但它们是彼此孤立的，没有可靠的水源，往往在天旱时，田里水干了不几天，塘里、堰里、水库里也很快就没有水了。西瓜秧式的灌溉网却完全避免了这种缺点，因为：它可以用常流的河水灌塘、灌堰、灌库，而下了雨时，承雨面积里的径流同样还可以灌塘、灌堰、灌库；同时，由于渠和塘、堰等是彼此相通的，还可扩大承雨面积。这样，它就可以把用不完的水蓄起来，作到“闲时蓄水忙时用”，使小型塘、堰、库能发挥大作用。
    这种新型的灌溉网还有一个重大特色是，它的施工简便，技术简单，投资少，建起来也很快。因为所谓拦河筑坝，除了很少的较大河流外，绝大多数都是很容易办的，有些水位较高的溪流，甚至可以不必筑坝就能从河边开渠引水。而修渠道和小型塘、堰、水库等，这也是简单易行的；特别是渠道，非常省工，几天就可挖一条，渠挖到哪里，水就可流到哪里。同时，有了这样的网后，原有的废塘、废堰，也可以略加整修后加以利用。至于勘测、设计，除了一些较大的渠道和河坝外，一般也是比较容易的。
    以上这些情况说明了什么呢？说明了建立西瓜秧式的灌溉网，完全可以作到多、快、好、省。而这个专区去冬今春的事实是可以充分地证实这点的。据统计，这个仅有五百多万人口的专区，在上述这段时间内共完成了大小工程十三万多处，其中渠道的总长度共达十三万华里，有十几条长江那样长。全区已在几百条大小不等的河上建起了众多的拦水坝；两岸的渠道密如蛛网；而各种塘、堰、水库，像是满天星斗。正是由于这些工程效益大，才使得这个专区在几个月的时间内就使水田由原来的三百多万亩增加到七百多万亩，还扩大了水浇地一百六十万亩；而这些水田和水浇地，几个月以前还是一些产量很低的山坡地、河滩地和无人耕种的荒地。除了这些新增的水田和水浇地外，全区还有二百七十万亩耕地的灌溉条件得到了改善。无论是从完成的工程量或受益面积来看，去冬今春都比前冬去春增加了许多倍，但投资却比前冬去春减少了三分之一以上。有许多工程，只用了几角钱到几块钱的灯油费就建起来了。
    襄阳专区的西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网，是这个专区各级领导抓住了群众的增产要求和实现增产的关键，领导群众开展了大规模的兴修水利运动的产物，同时又是这个专区的各级领导生动地贯彻执行了“蓄水为主、小型为主、社办为主”的水利建设方针的产物。无数的事实证明：建立起这样的水利灌溉网，只有大规模的群众运动才有可能；而只有抓住了群众的增产要求和实现增产的关键，同时又采取了易为群众所接受的“三主”方针，才能形成大规模的群众性的兴修水利运动。
    襄阳是个低产区，解放前全区的粮食产量平均每亩只二百多斤，大山区还只有百多斤。那时，群众生活很苦，“半年糠菜半年粮”；有些地区还是“八个月红薯，四个月南瓜”。解放后，在党的领导下，开展了大生产运动，粮食产量逐年提高，到去年达到了平均每亩三百多斤了。但是，和省内大多数专区比较起来，还是低产的。主要是因为旱地多水田少。全区原有耕地一千五百万亩中，解放时只有水田二百多万亩，而且大部还是不保收的；经过几年的扩充，到去年也只三百多万亩。几年来的事实证明，把旱地改成水田后，产量可以提高一倍半以上，群众说是“一水顶三旱”。改水田，这是增产的关键性措施，而改水田的关键，是兴修水利。就是这样，襄阳专区的领导方面紧紧地抓住了这个关键，发动群众大兴水利，又认真地贯彻了“三主”方针；采用参观评比的办法大力推广了群众在贯彻这个方针中出现的经验和创造，批判了保守思想。于是，一个大规模的水利运动开展起来了。而西瓜秧式的灌溉网，正是根据运动中群众的创造总结出来和在全区推广的。
