    Joyful Farmers' Poetry Contest

    The Bai Miao Agricultural Cooperative in the Huangsangpu Township, Baqiao District, Xi'an City, held a "Farmers' Poetry Contest" to praise the General Line of Socialist Construction and celebrate this year's bumper wheat harvest. At the poetry contest, Liu Zhicheng, the director of the agricultural cooperative, composed a poem on the spot as an opening remark: "Everyone please sit down and listen to my words. Today's meeting is extraordinary, reciting poems and performing clapper talks. We sing of this year's great harvest, we sing of the Party's General Line. Whoever has composed good poems, please come out and recite them now." Then, poets stood up one after another, vying to recite their own poems. Young cooperative member Hu Zhifu recited his new work: "A dragon flashes from the East, Mao Zedong is the dragon's head. Soaring through the clouds as swift as the wind, surpassing the British (England) and overwhelming the West Wind." Hu Haiming followed by saying: "Not afraid of heaven, not afraid of earth, what does a little sweat count for? In order to realize the General Line, I will work even if it costs my life." At this time, Qian Zhongliang, a cadre who had been sent to work at the grassroots level, also immediately composed a poem entitled "Immortals Yearning for the Mortal World": "In the past, the Third Sister descended to the mortal world, envying only the human world, not the immortals. In the future, when the General Line is realized, the celestial fairies will yearn for the mortal world even more. Seven jade maidens rush to the human world, each marrying a farmer. It's not that the immortals have lost their minds, the human world is ten thousand times better than heaven."

    Hu Gailan and her daughter Li Lingqiao from the Second Production Team of the Bai Miao Agricultural Cooperative brought the poetry contest to a climax. Thirteen-year-old Li Lingqiao recited three poems she had composed herself to celebrate the harvest. One of them read, "Dad and Mom go to production, I take care of my younger siblings; This year's grain is a great harvest, selling the surplus grain brings pocket money; Dad and Mom are very happy, sewing a set of floral clothes for me." Everyone in the audience cheered and applauded for this thirteen-year-old girl.

    In mid-March this year, the Bai Miao Agricultural Cooperative held a poetry contest to celebrate the victory of water conservancy construction. Since then, the cooperative members have created more than 250 new poems. All ninety-one households in the cooperative have new poems. This "Farmers' Poetry Contest" was held at the request of the masses. In the future, this agricultural cooperative will continue to hold such poetry contests to encourage the labor enthusiasm of all cooperative members. (Xinhua News Agency)

    欢乐的农民赛诗会
    西安市坝桥区黄桑圃乡白庙农业社，举办了一次“农民赛诗会”，歌颂社会主义建设总路线，歌颂今年的小麦丰收。在赛诗会上，农业社主任刘志诚当场编了一首诗，当作开场白：“大家都坐下，听我把言发，今天会议不一般，念诗又要说快板。歌唱今年大丰收，歌唱党的总路线。谁的诗歌编的好，现在就请出来念。”接着，赛诗者一个接着一个地站了起来，争着朗颂自己的诗歌。青年社员胡致富朗颂他的新作：“东方闪出一条龙，龙首就是毛泽东。腾云驾雾快如风，压倒西风超过英（英国）。”胡海明接着说：“天不怕，地不怕，流点汗水算个啥，为了实现总路线，拚上生命我也干。”这时，下放干部钱中良也马上编了一首题为“神仙思凡”的诗：“昔日三姐下凡间，只羡人间不羡仙。将来实现总路线，天上仙女更思凡。七个玉女奔人间，个个嫁给庄稼汉。不是神仙迷了心，人间比天上好万分。”
    白庙农业社第二生产队的胡改兰和她的女儿李玲巧把赛诗会引到了高潮，十三岁的李玲巧在会上接连朗颂了她自己创作的三首庆祝丰收的诗，有一首写道“爸爸妈妈去生产，弟弟妹妹我照管；今年粮食大丰产，卖了余粮有零钱；爸爸妈妈心喜欢，给我缝套花衣衫。”全场的人都为这个十三岁的小姑娘欢呼鼓掌。
    今年3月中旬，白庙农业社为了庆祝兴修水利的胜利，曾经举办过一次赛诗会。从那时起，社员们又创作了二百五十多首新诗歌。全社共有九十一户社员，家家户户都有新的诗歌。这次“农民赛诗会”，就是在群众要求下举办的。今后，这个农业社将不断地举办这种赛诗会，鼓舞全体社员的劳动热情。（新华社）
