New Technology New Products

A New Page in the History of the Foundry Industry: Shell Molding

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: Shell molding, used to replace sand molding, has recently been successfully tested at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. This major technological innovation has opened a new page in the history of China's machine foundry industry.

Using formaldehyde resin and other binders and sand to bake a light yellow thin-shell mold, and then pouring molten iron into the mold, various castings can be produced. Compared with sand casting, castings produced by this shell molding method have no pores or sand holes, and can be assembled without machining, which can also save a lot of metal materials. Recently, the staff of Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory used the shell molding method to recast six parts of the combine harvester, such as chain links and sprockets. After technical appraisal, they were all precise and did not need further processing. In this way, labor productivity has been greatly improved. In the past, it took 162 minutes to cast a sprocket, but now it only takes 50 minutes, and the cost is also reduced by 39%.

Shell molding is easy to operate and easy to master. It also improves the working conditions of workers. It is suitable for all metal castings.

Important Equipment for the Fertilizer Industry: High-Pressure Reaction Vessel

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Luda, June 14th: The high-pressure reaction vessel has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory. It is an important equipment for the production of synthetic ammonia (raw material for manufacturing ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, urea and other chemical fertilizers), and used to rely on imports. Now that the trial production has been successful, it is of great significance for the development of China's chemical fertilizer industry. The technical requirements for manufacturing high-pressure reaction vessels are very high. The cylinder is made of fourteen layers of steel plates wrapped and welded, and must be able to withstand 320 atmospheres of pressure. The steel plates used to produce this product must first undergo ultrasonic flaw detection, and after welding, they must also be subjected to X-ray inspection and heat treatment.

New Technology in the World of Rubber Tires: Steel Wire Tires

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 14th: Steel wire tires, a new technology in the world of rubber tires, have been successfully trial-produced by the Rubber Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

With the increase in the capacity of automobile engines and the continuous increase in driving speed and load capacity, more solid and durable tires are required to equip automobiles. Using metal cords instead of textile cords to make tires can increase the strength by four to five times, and the load-bearing capacity can be increased by more than 20%. A tire only needs two to four layers of metal cords, while eight to fourteen layers of textile cords are needed. This can not only save a lot of rubber, but also extend the life of the tire due to the thinning of the cord layer.

China's steel wire tires were made by technicians and workers of the Rubber Industry Research Institute on the 12th. The trial production time only took one month.

    新技术　新产品
    铸造工业史上新的一页　壳型铸造
    据新华社14日讯　用壳型铸造代替砂型铸造，最近在北京农业机械厂试验成功。这项重大的技术革新揭开了我国机器铸造工业史上新的一页。
    用甲醛树脂等粘结剂和砂子烧成淡黄色的薄壳模，然后把铁水倒在模里，就能铸出各种铸件。采用这种壳型铸造方法铸出来的铸件同砂型铸造比较，没有气孔和砂眼，不必进行机械加工就能装配，还能节约大量金属材料。最近北京农业机械厂职工用壳型铸造法翻铸联合收割机的链环、链轮等六种部件，经过技术鉴定，都很精密，不需再加工。这样，就大大提高了劳动生产率。过去铸一个链轮需要一百六十二分钟，现在只要五十分钟就够了，成本也降低了39％。
    壳型铸造法操作方便，容易掌握。还改善了工人的劳动条件。它对一切金属铸造都适用。
    化肥工业的重要设备　高压反应筒
    据新华社旅大14日电　高压反应筒最近在大连工矿车辆厂试制成功。它是生产合成氨（制造硫铵、硝铵、尿素等化学肥料的原料）的重要设备，过去都依靠进口。现在试制成功，对于发展我国化学肥料工业有很大意义。制造高压反应筒的技术要求很高。筒体是由十四层钢板包扎焊接成的，要能够承受三百二十个大气压。生产这项产品用的钢板，首先要经过超音波探伤，焊好后还要进行X光透视和热处理等。
    世界橡胶轮胎的新技术　钢丝轮胎
    新华社天津14日电世界橡胶轮胎的新技术——钢丝轮胎，已由化学工业部橡胶工业研究所试制成功。
    随着汽车发动机能力的增大，行驶速度和载重量的不断提高，要求有更坚固、耐用的轮胎来装备汽车。采用金属帘线代替纺织帘线制成轮胎，强力可以增加四倍到五倍，负重能力可以提高20％以上。一条轮胎采用金属帘线只要两层到四层，而采用纺织帘线却要八层到十四层，这不仅可以节省大量橡胶，还由于帘线层减薄，可以延长轮胎的寿命。
    我国钢丝轮胎是由橡胶工业研究所的技术人员和工人在12日制成的。试制时间只用了一个月。
