Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 28th: China's first electric locomotive was recently manufactured at the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant. It has already been transported to Beijing on the 24th of this month as a gift to celebrate "July 1st."

    The successful trial production of this medium-sized electric locomotive, weighing eighty tons and suitable for use in mines, marks a major step forward in the technical level of China's machinery industry. It was designed independently by the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant, with the guidance of Soviet experts and in cooperation with the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant and others. This type of electric locomotive can automatically unload and can pull seven to eight freight cars, each carrying sixty tons of coal, on a 20‰ gradient, traveling at 23.6 kilometers per hour. If running on a level track, the maximum speed can reach 75 kilometers per hour.

    The main advantages of electric locomotives are their high traction power, durable operation, ability to climb gradients of 35‰, and an efficiency twice that of steam locomotives, saving the country high-quality coal. Secondly, they are clean and hygienic, with no smoke or dust, easy to manage, and relatively safe, and can operate in water-scarce and cold regions.

    The Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant plans to produce thirty such electric locomotives this year. In addition, the plant also plans to design and trial-produce 138-ton electric locomotives for railway trunk lines.

    第一台电气机车诞生
    据新华社长沙28日电　我国第一台电气机车最近在湘潭电机厂制成以后，已经在本月24日运往北京，作为向“七一”的献礼。
    这台八十吨重、适合于矿山上用的中型电气机车的试制成功，标志着我国机械工业的技术水平又向前迈进了一大步。它是在苏联专家的指导之下，由湘潭电机厂自行设计，同山西机床厂等协作制造的。这种电气机车能自动卸载，可以牵引七到八个载重六十吨煤的车皮在千分之二十的坡道上行驶，一小时能跑二十三点六公里；如果在平道运行，最高速度可达七十五公里。
    电气机车的主要优点，是拉力大，运行持久，能爬行千分之三十五的坡道，效率比蒸气机车大两倍，能为国家节省优质煤炭；其次，是清洁卫生，没有烟砂飞扬，管理方便，又较安全，在缺水和寒冷地区一样可以行驶。
    湘潭电机厂准备在今年内生产这种电气机车三十台。此外，这个厂还准备设计和试制供铁路干线用的一百三十八吨重的电气机车。
