    Give Full Play to the Role of Civil Aviation and Better Serve Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Kuang Rennong, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
    Civil aviation is a modern means of transportation. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, it has crossed over from the transportation field into the field of direct production, becoming a modern and cutting-edge scientific and technological production tool. Now, with its characteristics of speed, economy, and flexibility, civil aviation is being widely used in industry, agriculture, scientific research, atmospheric exploration, and other fields.
    After more than eight years of hard work, China's civil aviation industry has now taken initial shape. At present, there are 33 routes nationwide, with a total route length of more than 26,000 kilometers. The basic business of civil aviation can be roughly divided into two categories: one is specialized aviation that directly serves industrial and agricultural production, including aerial photography, aerial prospecting, pest control, foliar fertilization, forest surveys, and forest fire prevention; the other is transport aviation, which involves transporting passengers, cargo, and mail on regular or irregular routes.
    In industry, the use of aircraft for aerial photography is faster and cheaper than ground surveying, and it is also more accurate and reliable. In 1957, an aircraft completed the topographic surveying of 9,000 square kilometers around the Sanmenxia Reservoir in one month. If ground measurements were to be carried out, it would require the mobilization of several large survey teams, and it would take a considerable amount of time to survey it section by section. Aircraft can also conduct large-scale mineral surveys in the inaccessible Gobi deserts and mountains. In 1957, civil aviation aircraft conducted oil surveys in the Gobi Desert of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The workload of one aircraft in one day was equivalent to the workload of a ground survey team of eighty people and eighty camels for 460 days. In the past four years, civil aviation prospecting aircraft have discovered more than 100 mineral deposits, providing important geological data for the development of China's industry.
    In agricultural production, the use of aircraft to control locusts, cotton bollworms, wheat midges, rice borers, and other pests can achieve significant economic results. In 1957, civil aviation aircraft controlled locusts in 18 counties including Linqing in Shandong. One An-2 aircraft could spray 30,000 mu per day, with a kill rate of over 90%. Moreover, crops did not suffer any losses, changing the situation of "locusts eating up everything, crops being trampled" that had existed since ancient times.
    In terms of transportation, civil aviation has greatly facilitated economic and cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges between countries, and shortened the distance between remote areas and the inland. Civil aviation aircraft have promptly transported various industrial equipment, precision instruments, and improved breeds of sheep, silkworms, and fish fry, vigorously supporting the development of industrial and agricultural production. This year, in order to solve the difficulties of inconvenient transportation in some areas, some short-distance local routes have been newly opened. Due to the low fares on local routes, farmers, herdsmen, and ordinary residents can now afford to fly.
    The development of civil aviation is closely linked to the development of industrial and agricultural production. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, civil aviation has received attention from all sides. However, at present, China's civil aviation industry, whether in terms of development speed or service scope, is far from meeting the needs of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production.
    To enable civil aviation to better serve industrial and agricultural production, we must, under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, implement a dual leadership system of the central government and local governments. International trunk lines, domestic trunk lines, and specialized aviation serving industrial production require greater centralization, so a dual leadership system with the central government as the main focus must be implemented; local routes and specialized aviation serving agricultural production require greater flexibility, so a dual leadership system with local governments as the main focus must be implemented, so as to better integrate with local production according to local conditions and times. Implementing a management method that combines the central government and local governments can give fuller play to the role of civil aviation. Of course, as a modern means of transportation and a production tool, civil aviation has its own special requirements in terms of technical arrangements, business management, and aircraft use. However, as long as we clarify the division of labor under the conditions of central and local management, and take various active and flexible measures according to the specific circumstances, any difficulties can be overcome. We believe that, under the conditions of centralized leadership, division of labor and cooperation, China's civil aviation will be able to join hands with other transportation undertakings to strive to "establish a well-connected transportation network based on modern tools throughout the country as soon as possible."
    In overall planning, we must place the development of specialized aviation in an important position. Specialized aviation is unprecedented in China's history. It has only been gradually established since liberation, and has completed various tasks in the past six years. However, the current new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has put forward more and more new demands on specialized aviation, which must be vigorously developed to catch up. In addition to being applied on a large scale in prospecting for mineral deposits, surveying the land, forest surveys, railway alignment, and factory site selection, industrial aviation must also gradually expand to various scientific research aspects. In addition to large-scale control of crop pests and diseases, the service scope of agricultural aviation will gradually carry out aerial fertilization, sowing, weeding, rainfall, and other operations on large areas of cultivated land according to needs and possibilities, and vigorously develop special cargo transportation to meet the needs of local industrial and agricultural production.
    While developing specialized aviation, we must pay attention to the construction of aviation trunk lines and local routes: open up a large number of new domestic and international trunk lines centered on the capital to form a well-connected trunk line network; and actively develop local routes centered on provincial capitals to form a local route network connected to aviation trunk lines.
    To give full play to the role of civil aviation, we must improve business management, improve aircraft utilization, improve service quality and work efficiency, strive to reduce costs, and continuously reduce air fares. Civil aviation is a new undertaking, and we lack experience in business management. In the past, we mechanically circled around balancing income and expenditure, so fares were too high and transport tonnage could not be fully utilized. Through the rectification movement, we have made detailed calculations and tapped internal potential, and believe that we can completely break the old balance and reduce costs and fares a lot. In the future, on the basis of continuously improving business management, with the continuous development of China's aviation science, aircraft manufacturing industry, and petroleum industry, the transportation cost of China's civil aviation can continue to decrease, and air fares will be able to generally approach the price of soft sleeper tickets on trains.
    In order to give full play to the role of civil aviation, all civil aviation personnel must overcome conservative thinking, vigorously carry out technological and cultural revolutions, strengthen scientific research, gradually adopt the latest types of aircraft, improve and strengthen communication and navigation equipment, and ensure that all types of aircraft can fly safely day and night under various complex weather conditions. At the same time, we must take active measures to accelerate the training of various types of civil aviation cadres to change the current situation of insufficient technical strength. We must launch a learning upsurge among on-the-job cadres, learn everything that is good and beneficial to us from other countries, eliminate feelings of inferiority, diligently study and practice with full confidence, and train a cadre team that is both highly politically conscious and proficient in technical business within three to five years.

    发挥民用航空的作用  更好地为工农业生产服务
    中国民用航空局局长　邝任农
    民用航空是一种现代的运输工具，随着现代科学技术日新月异的发展，已经从运输领域跨入直接生产的领域，成为一种现代最新科学技术的生产工具。现在，民用航空已经以它快速、经济、灵活的特点，而被广泛使用于工业、农业、科学研究、大气探索等方面。
    经过八年多的努力经营，我国民用航空事业现在已经初具规模。现在全国共有三十三条航线，航线总长度达二万六千多公里。民用航空的基本业务大致可以分为两类：一类是直接为工农业生产服务的专业航空，包括航空摄影、航空探矿、防治虫害、根外追肥、森林调查、护林防火等；一类是运输航空，就是在定期的或者不定期的航线上运送旅客、货物和邮件。
    在工业方面，利用飞机进行空中摄影比地面测绘的速度快、费用省，而且正确可靠。1957年，一架飞机在一个月当中就完成了三门峡水库周围九千平方公里的地形测绘。如果进行地面测量，至少要动员好几个庞大的测量队，用相当长的时间才能分区分段地测绘出来。飞机还可以在人迹难到的戈壁荒滩和崇山峻岭地带进行大规模的矿产普查。1957年民航飞机在新疆塔里木盆地的戈壁滩上进行石油普查，一架飞机一天的工作量相当于一个由八十个人和八十只骆驼组成的地面普查队四百六十天的工作量。四年来民航探矿飞机已经发现了一百多处矿藏，为我国工业的发展提供了重要的地质资料。
    在农业生产方面，利用飞机除治蝗虫、棉虫、小麦吸浆虫、稻螟虫等可以收到显著的经济效果。1957年民航飞机在山东临清等十八个县除治蝗虫，一架安二型飞机一天能够喷治三万亩，杀虫率达到了90％以上。而且农作物没有受到任何损失，改变了自古以来“蝗虫打光，庄稼踩光”的情况。
    在交通运输方面，民用航空大大地便利了经济、文化交流和国际间的友好往来，缩短了边远地区和内地之间的距离。民航飞机及时地运送了各种工业器材、精密仪器和优良羊种、蚕种、鱼苗等，有力地支援了工农业生产的发展。今年为了解决某些地区交通不便的困难，新开辟了一些短程的地方航线。由于地方航线的运价低廉，农民、牧民和一般居民现在也坐得起飞机了。
    民用航空的发展和工农业生产的发展是密切联系的。随着工农业生产的大跃进，民用航空已经受到各方面的重视。但是目前我国民用航空事业无论在发展速度方面或者在服务范围方面都还远不能适应工农业生产飞跃发展的需要。
    要使民用航空更好地为工农业生产服务，我们必须在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，实行中央和地方双重领导的办法。国际干线、国内干线和为工业生产服务的专业航空要求较大的集中性，因此必须实行以中央为主的双重领导；地方航线和为农业生产服务的专业航空要求较大的灵活性，因此必须实行以地方为主的双重领导；以便因时因地制宜，更好地同地方生产结合起来。实行中央和地方相结合的管理方法，就可更充分地发挥民用航空的作用。当然，民用航空作为现代化的交通工具和生产工具，在技术安排、经营管理、飞机使用等方面有自己的特殊要求，但是只要我们在中央和地方分管的条件下明确分工，根据具体情况采取各种积极而灵活的措施，任何困难都是可以克服的。我们相信，在集中领导、分工协作的条件下，我国的民用航空一定能够同其他交通运输事业一起，争取尽快地“在全国范围内建立一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网”。
    在全面规划中，必须把发展专业航空放在重要的地位。专业航空在我国历史上是从来没有过的，解放以后才逐步建立起来，六年来完成了各项任务。但是当前工农业生产大跃进的新形势向专业航空提出了愈来愈多的新的要求，必须大力发展，迎头赶上。工业航空除了大规模地应用于探测矿藏、测量大地和森林调查、铁路选线、工厂选址等方面以外，还必须逐步地扩大到各种科学研究方面。农业航空的服务范围除了大规模地除治农作物病虫害以外，将根据需要与可能，逐步地在大面积的耕地上进行航空施肥、播种、除草、降雨等作业，并且大力发展特种货物运输，以适应地方工农业生产的需要。
    在发展专业航空的同时，必须注意航空干线和地方航线的建设：大量开辟以首都为中心的新的国内干线和国际干线，组成四通八达的干线网；并且积极发展以省会为中心的地方航线，组成与航空干线相连接的地方航线网。
    要充分发挥民用航空的作用，就必须改善经营管理，提高飞机利用率，提高服务质量和工作效率，努力降低成本，不断地降低航空运价。民用航空是一项新的事业，我们在经营管理上缺乏经验，过去曾经机械地在收支平衡上打圈子，因此运价偏高，运输吨位不能得到充分的利用。通过整风运动，我们算了细账，挖掘了内部的潜力，认为完全可以打破旧的平衡，使成本和运价降低很多。今后在不断地改善经营管理的基础上，随着我国的航空科学、飞机制造业和石油工业的不断发展，我国民用航空的运输成本还可以继续降低，航空运价将能够普遍地接近于火车软席卧铺的票价。
    为了充分发挥民用航空的作用，全体民航工作人员，必须克服保守思想，大力进行技术革命和文化革命，加强科学研究，逐步采用最新型的飞机，改进和加强通信导航设备，保证各型飞机能够在各种复杂的天气条件下昼夜安全飞行。同时，必须采取积极的措施加速培养各类民航干部，以改变目前技术力量不足的状况。掀起在职干部的学习热潮，学习其他国家的一切好的、对我们有利的东西，打掉自卑感，信心百倍地勤学苦练，在三、五年内培养出一支既有高度的政治觉悟又通晓技术业务的又红又专的干部队伍。
