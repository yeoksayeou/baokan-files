Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Our reporter Li Nan reports: Thousands of Soviet industrial enterprises and design institutions are making their greatest efforts to support China's production Great Leap Forward, completing China's various orders ahead of schedule.

    The head of the Socialist Countries Enterprise Construction Department of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Kolopolov, and the chief expert of this department in charge of Chinese affairs, Milotnichenko, recently told reporters that since almost all regions of the Soviet Union are manufacturing orders for China, it is no exaggeration to say that factories and enterprises throughout the Soviet Union are working hard to support the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people.

    Kolopolov and Milotnichenko said that Soviet experts returning from China reported to the workers in factories and enterprises about the enthusiasm of Chinese comrades and the situation of the Great Leap Forward, which greatly encouraged the Soviet workers who were producing orders for China. They also said that we are very aware of China's important tasks in construction. As soon as we learned that Chinese comrades had put forward the grand plan of the Great Leap Forward, we notified the various enterprises and design institutions, mobilizing them to strive to complete China's orders ahead of schedule.

    The two responsible comrades said that almost all economic zones in the Soviet Union now have the task of producing orders for China (of which eighty-six economic zones bear particularly heavy tasks), and thousands of industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet Union are manufacturing orders for China. Hundreds of design institutions are helping China with design work. At present, factory workers in famous Soviet industrial areas such as Moscow, Leningrad, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Rostov, Kiev, Stalino, Tomsk, and Dnepropetrovsk are working day and night to rush production of orders for China. They have taken many measures to support China's Great Leap Forward and supply machinery and equipment in a timely manner. In factories and workshops manufacturing equipment for China, one can often see slogans such as "Complete orders for People's China ahead of schedule." Factory administration and Party organizations also regard checking the production of machinery and equipment shipped to China as a part of checking the entire production situation.

    Kolopolov and Milotnichenko said that it is now an important and glorious task for us to support the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise to produce iron before October 1 this year. The triple crane coupling machine produced by the Ural Electrical Equipment Factory for Wuhan Iron and Steel was originally scheduled to be delivered in the fourth quarter of this year, but now the workers are preparing to complete the manufacturing in June and ship it to China.

    Some orders are outside this year's order plan, but Soviet factories have decided to produce them ahead of schedule this year. For example, a large material bell boom, 14 meters long, an important component manufactured by the Ural Machinery Factory for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace, was requested from the Soviet factory in May this year. Although this was outside the Ural Machinery Factory's order plan, the factory still decided to manufacture and ship this equipment in August this year, that is, in two months. In addition, the sintering machine, the "1150" type primary rolling mill, and the "2800" type plate rolling mill manufactured by this factory for Wuhan Iron and Steel are also prepared to be manufactured and shipped to China ahead of schedule. The latter two machines weigh a total of 20,000 tons.

    For China's other important construction projects, such as the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project, the Fengman Hydropower Station, and the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, the relevant Soviet enterprises are also preparing to complete orders ahead of schedule. For example, the factory manufacturing vertical pumps for Baotou Iron and Steel was originally scheduled to deliver the goods at the end of 1959, but now it is preparing to deliver the goods ahead of schedule in early 1959. The first two water turbines with a generating capacity of 137,500 kilowatts each, manufactured by the Soviet factory for the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project, were originally planned to be built in 1963, but in order to support China's early power generation in this water conservancy project, the Soviet factory is now preparing to manufacture and ship the two machines ahead of schedule in 1960-1961.

    Soviet design institutions have also decided to complete many design tasks undertaken for China's industrial construction ahead of schedule.

    In terms of transportation, machinery and equipment sent to China are mainly transported by rail. Soviet railway workers always try to transport machinery and equipment to China as soon as possible. When China urgently needs machinery and equipment, sometimes freight cars are attached to passenger trains for transportation in order to transport them quickly and in a timely manner.

    苏联人民发挥高度国际主义精神
    加紧赶制订货支援我国大跃进
    新华社莫斯科18日电　本社记者李楠报道：苏联数以千计的工业企业、设计机关正以最大的努力支援中国的生产大跃进，提前完成中国的各项订货。
    苏联部长会议国家对外经济委员会社会主义国家企业建设部主任科洛波洛夫和这个部负责中国事务的总专家米罗特尼钦科最近对记者说，由于苏联各地区几乎都在为中国制造订货，所以可以毫不夸张地说，全苏联的工厂企业都在努力支援中国人民的大跃进。
    科洛波洛夫和米罗特尼钦科说，从中国回来的苏联专家在工厂企业中向职工们报告了中国同志的干劲和大跃进的情况，给为生产中国订货的苏联职工带来极大的鼓舞。他们又说，我们非常了解中国在建设方面的重大任务。当我们一知道中国同志提出了大跃进的雄伟计划之后，我们就通知了各个企业和设计机关，动员他们努力提前完成中国的订货。
    这两位负责同志说，苏联几乎所有经济区现在都有为中国生产订货的任务（其中有八十六个经济区承担的任务特别多），全苏联为中国制造订货的有数以千计的工业企业，帮助中国进行设计工作的有上百的设计机关。目前，莫斯科、列宁格勒、车里雅宾斯克、斯维德洛夫斯克、罗斯托夫、基辅、斯大林诺、托木斯克、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克等苏联著名工业区的工厂职工都在日以继夜地为中国赶制订货。他们为支援中国的大跃进、及时供应机器设备，采取了许多措施。在为中国制造设备的工厂和车间里，常常可以看到“提前为人民中国完成订货”的鼓动标语。工厂行政和党组织也把检查运往中国的机器设备的生产情况作为检查整个生产情况的一项内容。
    科洛波洛夫和米罗特尼钦科说，现在，支援中国武汉钢铁联合企业提前在今年10月1日前出铁，是我们的一项重要的光荣任务。乌拉尔电气设备工厂为武钢生产的三重式起重联动机原定在今年第四季度交货，现在工人们准备在6月份就制造完成并运到中国去。
    有些订货是今年订货计划以外的，但是苏联各工厂决定在今年就提前生产。例如，乌拉尔机器工厂为武钢一号高炉制造的一个重要部件——长达十四公尺的大料钟吊杆，是在今年5月份提出请苏联工厂制造的，这虽然是在乌拉尔机器工厂订货计划以外的，但是这个工厂仍然决定在今年8月、就是说要以两个月的时间，把这个设备制造好并运到中国去。此外，这个工厂为武钢制造的烧结机、“一一五○”型初轧机和“二八○○”型轧板机也准备提前制成并运往中国，其中后两部机器共重两万吨。
    对于中国的另外一些重要建设，如包头钢铁联合企业、三门峡水利枢纽工程、丰满水电站、北京热电站等，苏联有关的企业也准备提前完成订货。例如，为包钢制造立式泵的工厂按计划是在1959年底交货，而现在准备在1959年初就提前交货。苏联工厂为三门峡水利枢纽工程制造的头两部发电能力各为十三万七千五百瓩的水轮机原计划要在1963年造好，但是为了支援中国这一水利工程提前发电，苏联工厂现在准备提前在1960—1961年内就把两部机器制造好并运往中国。
    苏联的设计机关也决定提前完成为中国工业建设担负的许多设计任务。
    在运输方面，送往中国的机器设备主要是用铁路运输的。苏联铁路工人总是努力设法尽快地把机器设备运往中国。遇有中国需用很急的机器设备，有时就把货车挂在客车列车上运送，以便运送得迅速及时。
