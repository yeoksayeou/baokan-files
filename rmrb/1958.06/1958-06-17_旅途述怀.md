Thoughts on a Journey
Xiao Xiangrong

Two Poems on the Northeast

Recalling the past, coming east amidst the flames of war,
The land scarred and devastated, smoke filled the air.
The bitter struggle at Siping, the loss of Changchun,
Soldiers cold in their uniforms, yet resolute in spirit.
Three battles at Songjiang in the snow,
Spring returned, the old fortresses regained.
Sweep away the court, exterminate the vile hordes,
To liberate the whole region, take the initial lead.

Today, twelve years since coming east,
A hundred flowers bloom, vying in brilliance.
Workers and peasants leap forward, singing new songs,
Soldiers return to cultivate the old fields.
The Heilong River meanders, connecting to the northern friendship,
The Changbai Mountains stretch, forging southern bonds.
Forever safeguarding world peace,
Join hands and ascend together to the ninth heaven.

Two Poems on the Badaling Great Wall

The Great Wall, ten thousand li, through endless time,
Stands majestically among the peaks, enduring many autumns.
The city towers faintly retain their ancient traces,
Accommodating honored guests who delight in leisurely excursions.
"He who has not been to the Great Wall is no true man,"
Today, the spring colors descend the mountain peaks.
Millennial great deeds leave behind signs and symbols,
The entire nation united, sharing a common defense.

Two Poems on Guangzhou

A plum blossom bud has not yet opened,
Twice the Eastern Expeditions (note) came with the rain.
Today, the morning sun brings good tidings of spring,
Lingnan flowers bloom, filling the Jade Terrace.
(Note) Refers to the two Eastern Expeditions launched by the Guangdong Nationalist Government in March and November of 1925.

From the Pearl River's edge, gazing towards the Han River,
Thousands of miles away, I faintly smell the fragrance of spring wheat.
If you ask what I think of Meizhou,
Beyond the white clouds lies my hometown.

    旅途述怀
    萧向荣
    东北二首
    忆昔东来烽火悬，疮夷满地遍狼烟。
    四平苦斗长春失，战士襟寒志气坚。
    雪里松江三战伐，春归旧垒复重圆。
    犁庭扫穴歼群丑，解放全区先着鞭。
    今日东来十二年，群芳竞放斗鲜妍。
    工农跃进歌新曲，战士归来垦旧田。
    黑水自萦连北好，白山绵亘结南缘。
    长将世界和平保，携手同登上九天。
    八达岭二首
    长城万里历悠悠，屹立群峰几度秋。
    城阙依稀留故迹，修来佳客喜遨游。
    “不到长城非好汉”，今朝春色下峰峦。
    千年伟迹垂征象，举国同心共枕干。
    广州二首
    一枝梅蕊未曾开，两度东征（注）带雨来。
    此日朝阳春信好，岭南花放满瑶台。
    （注）指一九二五年三月和十一月，当时广东国民政府举行的两次东征。
    珠江眼底望韩江，千里遥闻春麦香。
    若问梅州何所思？白云天外有家乡。
