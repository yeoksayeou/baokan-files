Six Discourses on Formal Logic and Dialectics
—A Brief Reply to Ma Te
    In the People's Daily, April 15, 1958, seventh edition, Ma Te published an article entitled "Discussion on Logical Issues," posing as a concluding summary, commenting on many people, and also placing me in the ranks of revisionism, demanding criticism. I have carefully studied this article and found it problematic from beginning to end.
    Here, I will briefly discuss a few prominent issues.
    I. The Material Basis of Logic Is Not Equivalent to Logic Itself
    Since its inception, formal logic has never faced the issue of whether it has a material basis. Its objective material basis has never been opposed by anyone, and it does not require any advocacy or introduction from any materialist. In the September 1956 issue of New Construction, I said: "The laws of formal logic, or the laws of thought, or logical laws have origins and outcomes; they have a foundation and an effect. I said that the laws of formal logic only regulate the process of inference, and do not add any explanation or interpretation to things themselves. This refers to the outcome or effect of logical laws... No one doubts that the laws of thought have a material basis, and it does not require any advocacy or introduction from any materialist." In the June 1957 issue of New Construction, I also said: "The logical rules taught in formal logic textbooks, such as 'the extension of a term in the conclusion must be no greater than its extension in the premise,' 'no conclusion can be drawn from two particular affirmative premises,' 'the middle term in each syllogism must be distributed at least once in the two premises,' 'if one premise is particular, the conclusion must also be particular,' 'if one premise is negative, the conclusion must also be negative,' 'no conclusion can be drawn from two negative premises,' etc., only require the regulation of the thought process. Since the emergence of formal logic, this has been very clear and has never raised the issue of whether it has a material basis." The reason is very simple: because the material basis of logic is not equivalent to logic itself. Therefore, clarifying the application of logical laws, rules, etc., without involving its foundation, still does not detract from formal logic. Conversely, if the unproblematic foundation is discussed extensively, and the application of laws, rules, etc., is set aside, even if a flower is grown, it is irrelevant to the essence of formal logic. Therefore, all formal logic textbooks, whether from the Soviet Union or from capitalist countries, after presenting the laws and rules, immediately discuss their application; the material basis is left untouched. Not discussing it does not mean denying it, only because it is not a problem.
    Not only that, even if the unproblematic material basis is discussed very well, as Mr. Li Zhicai does, it is still irrelevant to the purpose and requirements of formal logic. I once said: "Formal logic has a basis and an object. Axioms such as 'affirming the whole also affirms its part' are the basis that formal logic must adhere to; facts such as whether Zhang San and Li Si are alive or dead are the objects that formal logic wants to infer. I said that the rules of formal logic only regulate the thought process and do not add any explanation or interpretation to things themselves. This refers to the object. Mr. Li Zhicai immediately replied that the 'axiom' of 'affirming the whole also affirms its part' 'specifically reflects the necessary connection between the general and the particular in objective things.' That's absolutely right, this axiom reflects the necessary connection between the general and the particular in objective things and can be used as the basis of a syllogism. But the problem lies here: the indispensable basis of formal logic is not equivalent to the object to be inferred. The two are distinctly different and cannot be confused. The axiom of 'affirming the whole also affirms its part' is what countless syllogisms have had to follow since the emergence of formal logic. Does that mean that countless different objects that syllogisms want to infer have only one meaning? Is there only one single significance? Giving all these different objects one single axiom that 'affirming the whole also affirms its part' can be considered adding any explanation or interpretation to the nature of objective things themselves?" Mr. Jiang Tianji put it well: "The premise of inference logically contains the conclusion." Since the conclusion is already logically contained in the premise, what is added through the inference form? The answer is, nothing is added. The material basis of logic does not affect the purpose and requirements of logic. It can be seen that the material basis of logic is not equivalent to logic itself.
    II. Laws and Rules Are Indispensable for Formal Logic
    Although the material basis of logic is not equivalent to logic itself, laws and rules are indispensable for formal logic. Any logic textbook studies the thought process; to make thinking correct, one must abide by the laws and rules that should be followed. For example, the "Logic" edited by Gorsky and Tavanets states: "Logic only studies our thoughts (concepts, judgments, inferences) from the structural aspect of thought, that is, from the logical form of thought. It reveals some laws and rules. Abiding by these laws and rules is a necessary condition for achieving truth in the process of obtaining inferred knowledge." It also states: "We study logical laws and rules because abiding by these laws and rules is a necessary condition for achieving truth in the process of obtaining inferred knowledge." Ma Te, on the other hand, says: "Wang Fangming... believes that people's social constraints are the objective basis of logical laws, which actually denies that logical laws are the reflection of the relationships of objective external things in human thinking. This violates the principle of reflection of Marxism, and in essence, it is a replica of the conventionalism in modern bourgeois logic theory." I am not interested in knowing what Wang Fangming said. But once logical laws and rules are reflected from the relationships of objective things into laws and rules, do they have a regulating or constraining effect on the thought process? If the answer is yes, should all textbooks that study logical laws and rules, including Soviet textbooks, be uniformly referred to as "replicas of conventionalism in modern logic theory"? If the answer is no, then what exactly is formal logic supposed to study? Mr. Jiang Tianji denies logical laws and rules. He published a lengthy article in the March and April 1957 issues of New Construction, saying: "Inference rules... are not the basis for determining whether an inference is correct." Second, he said: "Inference rules are only standards for checking whether an inference conforms to logical laws, but they are not the basis for determining whether an inference is correct." Third, he said: "An inference that does not violate the rules is a sign of its correctness; but it cannot be said that this inference is correct because of these rules." No one objects to the material basis of the laws and rules of formal logic; however, in order to emphasize the objective material basis, even the role of the laws and rules reflected from the basis is canceled out, which is a completely different issue. Adhering to materialism is good; canceling the role of logical laws and rules is, in my humble opinion, unacceptable. Ma Te and Mr. Jiang are on the same path, claiming to be "adhering to the principles of Marxist logic theory." Does adhering to the principles of Marxist logic theory mean denying the role of the laws and rules of formal logic? Are Soviet logic textbooks all anti-Marxist or do not adhere to the principles of Marxist logic theory?

    III. To Make Cognition and Practice Relate
    A thought process that conforms to the rules can become a correct syllogism. A syllogism in which there is no contradiction between the premise and the conclusion is called correctness, which belongs to the scope of inference; the premise that is consistent with the facts is called truthfulness, which belongs to the scope of practice. Whether cognition is true or not is the matter of each subject; whether inference is wrong or not is the matter of formal logic. Ma Te does not agree, saying that I have separated cognition and argumentation, and "will fall into the quagmire of formalism and idealism." He said:
    Zhou Gucheng believes that formal logic "focuses on inferring existing knowledge or understanding."
    "Whether cognition is true or not is the matter of each subject; whether inference is wrong or not is the matter of formal logic."
    This means that formal logic only manages the expression of argumentation and does not care about the cognition of reality... Although there are differences between argumentation methods and cognition methods, there are also connections. The two are unified in formal logic. Argumentation is based on cognition, and without cognition, there is no way to argue. Separating cognition and argumentation will lead to the quagmire of formalism and idealism.
    Here, I would like to discuss this in slightly more detail to see who will fall into the quagmire.
    First, what does it mean that argumentation methods and cognition methods "have differences"? I said that whether cognition is true or not is the matter of each subject, meaning that cognition relies on the practice of each subject; whether inference is wrong or not is the matter of formal logic, meaning that argumentation relies on logical inference. If you think this distinction is wrong, please tell me what your correct distinction is; if you cannot explain it, then the so-called "have differences" is empty talk and nonsense, and it has already fallen into the quagmire of formalism.
    Second, what does it mean that argumentation methods and cognition methods "have connections"? I said that the task of formal logic is to "infer existing knowledge," meaning to infer based on existing knowledge; you said that "argumentation is based on cognition," which is also inferring based on existing knowledge. May I ask, Mr. Ma Te, where exactly is the difference between you and me? If there is no difference, why is what you say called the two have connections, and what I say is called the two are separated?
    Third, what does it mean that argumentation and cognition are "unified" in formal logic? Since it is said that argumentation is based on cognition, it is clear that the two can be separated. If it is also said that they are "unified," then what is the significance of saying that argumentation is based on cognition?
    Fourth, if argumentation based on cognition is correct, then what is cognition based on? If it is based on practice, then it is clearly what you oppose; if you turn around and still base it on argumentation, then you will fall into the dead end of circular argumentation: argumentation is based on cognition, cognition is based on argumentation; repeating endlessly, cycling without end!
    People who claim to adhere to Marxism at every turn are afraid of touching practice when they talk about cognition, and as soon as they hear that whether cognition is true or not depends on the practice of each subject, they think that others are wrong, saying that they have separated cognition and argumentation. Please forgive me for saying, is there even a hint of Marxist spirit here? Chairman Mao said in On Practice: "If anyone wants to know something, there is no other way to solve it except to contact that thing, that is, to live (practice) in the environment of that thing." Ma Te simply does not believe in practice! If he does not believe in practice, he will believe in inference, he will believe in formal logic. However, if formal logic is not combined with each subject, what exactly can it enable us to know? Can it enable us to know animals? Plants? Astronomy? Geography? History? Society? It can enable us to know nothing. If you do not believe it, please check any logic textbook and see what else it can give us besides laws, rules, thought processes, and inference forms. Conversely, if it is combined with practice and serves each subject, inferring based on existing knowledge to ensure that there is no contradiction between the beginning and the end, the effect is obvious. Any scientist, when conducting research or pursuing truth, must ask himself on the one hand whether what he knows is consistent with objective reality, and on the other hand whether what he knows is contradictory between the beginning and the end. The former belongs to the scope of practice, and the latter belongs to the scope of argumentation. Cognition can be obtained from practice, and argumentation can be made based on cognition. For example, "people will suffocate to death in a room without air" is a cognition derived from practice; based on this, the inference can be made that "this room has no air, so people may suffocate to death," so that practice can be relaxed slightly. If from the beginning, only argumentation is allowed to relate to cognition, but cognition is not allowed to relate to practice, does this conform to Marxist theory? Please tell me who has fallen into the quagmire of idealism.
    IV. Do Not Create Reasons to Oppose Dialectics
    The correctness of inference can be achieved by following logical rules. As for the truthfulness of cognition, that is, sufficient reason, it is completely different. It cannot be achieved by following some immutable rules and doing it immediately, but it is gradually achieved through practice. Although there is an old saying called "sudden enlightenment," which means suddenly understanding something; but before "sudden enlightenment," there must be so-called "gradual enlightenment," which means gradually understanding through practice. In the process of seeking knowledge, human beings always demand truthfulness and always demand obtaining sufficient reason. However, limited by historical conditions, what is known is sometimes not completely true and does not always have sufficient reason. Precisely because of this, they constantly strive and constantly practice in order to obtain true knowledge and obtain sufficient reason. In the September 1956 issue of New Construction, I said: "Sufficient reason is indispensable for seeking true knowledge, but those who use it as a basis for inference do not necessarily have sufficient reason. This is an ironclad fact throughout history, both in China and abroad, and cannot be erased. Since ancient times, those who have used formal logic to promote their own views have not necessarily had sufficient reason for their views. Even Aristotle himself, the founder of formal logic, is no exception. Aristotle used formal logic to promote his own views; his works are still visible. May I ask what percentage of his views had sufficient reason? Since then, the scholastic scholars of the Middle Ages, the bourgeois scholars of modern times, and the imperialist scholars of recent times have used formal logic to promote their own views, and there are countless of them. Did their views all have sufficient reason? Not only that, even we ourselves use formal logic to promote our own views every day, can we guarantee that our own views all have 100% sufficient reason? For example, in the periodization of ancient history, each holds a different view, and all use formal logic to promote their own views, and their views do not necessarily have 100% sufficient reason either." Otherwise, what is the point of studying and researching? What is the point of free debate? What is the point of critically studying the history of philosophy and the history of thought? What is the point of talking about the transition from relative truth to absolute truth? Ma Te does not agree, saying that I have separated correctness and truthfulness, completely opposing the two, which will lead to idealism and formalism. He said:
    Regarding the relationship between the correctness of thinking form and the truthfulness of thinking content, there are also two different views. One view is that formal logic only manages the correctness of thinking form and does not care about the truthfulness of thinking content. Zhou Gucheng is the most determined and clearest in expressing this view. He believes that formal logic has no opinion on anything. It can serve correct views, and it can also serve wrong views. Views have correct and incorrect ones, but the syllogisms deduced from the views themselves can all be correct. Whether a view is correct or not depends on whether it conforms to the facts; and whether a syllogism is correct or not depends on whether it contradicts itself between the beginning and the end... Separating correctness and truthfulness and completely opposing the two will lead to idealism and formalism.
    What is called "separation"? What should be correct is correct, what should be truthful is not truthful, but the two are linked together. We seek truth from facts, pointing out the facts as they are, is this called "separation"?
    The bourgeoisie says: "All means of production should be privately owned, large factories are means of production, so large factories should be privately owned." Which of the formal logic's rule does this syllogism violate? It violates no single rule. Where is the mistake? The mistake is that it should not be advocated that means of production should be privately owned. Then is the one who opposes private ownership Marxism, or formal logic? If it is formal logic, then formal logic has become an absolutely supreme thing that can replace Marxism! It has been heard that some people want to absolutize formal logic, believing that everything that conforms to formal logic is correct. That's great, Marxism is not necessary, dialectical materialism can be put away, and there is no need to mention materialistic dialectics. If that is the case, then the world has really changed, and I will have to change with it. But in fact, the world has not changed, formal logic has not been absolutized, Marxism cannot be dispensed with, dialectical materialism cannot be put away; as for formal logic, it needs the leadership of materialistic dialectics even more. Absolutizing formal logic, believing that the inference is correct if it conforms to logic, the view is correct, is only an excuse to oppose dialectics, and it is only a reason that is created subjectively to oppose materialistic dialectics. Mr. Ma! Correctness and truthfulness are not always consistent. Even Mr. Jiang Tianji once said in his article "Summary of Logical Issues" in the March and April 1957 issues of New Construction: "Inference is by no means a purely formal deduction, but a process of logically deriving conclusions from premises that are true or assumed to be true... Reasoning generally does not start from premises that are determined to be false. If the premise is false, it is always determined or assumed to be true in the reasoning process." Mr. Jiang probably does not want to oppose materialistic dialectics, so he has left this way out: even if the premise is false, it is sometimes okay to assume it to be true. This makes sense. Mr. Ma does not agree, clinging to correctness and truthfulness together, not allowing them to be distinguished clearly, on the one hand, claiming that the two have differences, and on the other hand, canceling out this difference. There is no other reason for this except to insist on opposing the leadership of materialistic dialectics.
    V. Formal Logic Should Rely on Materialistic Dialectics
    If the premise is not true, it can only be assumed to be true sometimes, which is a last resort, not something that is satisfying to the heart. Then what can be done? The answer is: adhering to Marxist materialistic dialectics and practicing it in the environment of what you want to know is a better way. Of course, if you read Marxist books well without any practice, you may know nothing except Marxist books. But people who value practice can use Marxist materialistic dialectics as leadership, and cognition can always be gradually truthful. Therefore, I have ventured to say more than once that formal logic should take materialistic dialectics as its leadership: dialectics is the master, and formal logic is the servant; although there is a distinction between master and servant, they cannot be separated at any time. Especially when we are engaged in polemics with the enemy, we must adhere to this point. Formal logic is a common weapon for both the enemy and us; with the addition of materialistic dialectics as leadership, the situation is different, and the power of the weapon in our hands can be better brought into play. Otherwise, if we use formal logic to fight formal logic, and use syllogisms to fight syllogisms, we will often fall into the enemy's encirclement or even stand on the enemy's side without realizing it.
    For example, Mr. Shen Bingyuan opposes the U.S. imperialism establishing military bases in various countries, which is originally a very good intention that everyone should support. However, he does not use materialistic dialectics, but still begs for pity from the syllogisms that the enemy also masters, talking about the axioms of syllogisms, talking about the whole including the part, talking about the principle of a schoolbag including a photo and a pocket including money; as a result, he stands on the enemy's side without realizing it. What a pity! He has a debate in the July 1956 issue of New Construction:
    Why is it that the same kind of inference... the latter inference (imperialism establishes military bases in foreign countries for the safety of its own country; then, U.S. imperialism has established military bases around the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries; therefore, U.S. imperialism is also for the safety of its own country.) is absurd? This is still determined by the inference itself. The emergence of syllogisms has its objective basis; to clarify this point, we must start from the axiom of syllogisms. The axiom of syllogisms is: what is affirmed for the whole is also affirmed for its part. What is denied for the whole is also denied for its part. This axiom can be expressed in another way, that is, the attribute of the attribute of things is also the attribute of the thing itself. This axiom of syllogisms is summarized from people's countless life practices, just like a photo is clipped in a book, the book is placed in a schoolbag, so the photo is in the schoolbag. Another example is that money is put in a wallet, and the wallet is put in a pocket, so the money is also in the pocket. People summarize the axiom of syllogisms based on these most common and most common relationships of things, and people use these most common and most common axioms to reason and seek new knowledge.
    What is the difference between affirming the whole and also affirming the part, the schoolbag including the photo in the book, and the pocket including the money in the wallet, etc., and the U.S. imperialism wanting to establish military bases in foreign countries, and thus also wanting to establish military bases around the people's democratic countries? To support U.S. imperialism, this passage is sufficient; to oppose U.S. imperialism, materialistic dialectics must be added on top of the syllogisms. Ma Te said that the path of Shen and Ma, etc., is correct. I don't know if he has read this passage. If he has not read it, arbitrarily commenting is, if I may say so, not faithful to scholarship; if he has read it and has not understood it, please forgive me for saying that he is too careless with scholarship. Ma Te has placed me in the ranks of revisionism and wants to criticize me; I think this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, which is not worth it. It is better to consider another target for criticism!
    (Editor's note: In 1956 and 1957, Professor Zhou Gucheng published articles five times in "New Construction" magazine to discuss the issue of formal logic and dialectics.)

    六论形式逻辑与辩证法
    ——略答马特
    周谷城
    1958年4月15日人民日报第七版上，马特发表了“关于逻辑问题的讨论”一文，俨然作总结，评论了许多人，而且把我也排在修正主义之列，要进行批判。我仔细地研究了这篇文章，感到它从头到尾都成问题。
    这里且就几个突出的问题略论如下。
    一、逻辑的物质基础并不等于逻辑本身
    形式逻辑自成立以来，从不发生有无物质基础的问题，其客观物质基础也从来没有人反对，更不劳任何唯物论者的宣传和介绍。我在1956年新建设9月号里曾说：“形式逻辑的规律或思维规律或逻辑法则有来历，也有出路；有基础，也有作用。我说形式逻辑的法则只是规定推论过程的，对于事物自身并没有增加什么说明或解释。所指的是逻辑法则的出路或作用。……思维规律之有物质基础，并没有人怀疑，更不须任何唯物论者的宣传和介绍。”在1957年新建设6月号里我又说：“形式逻辑教科书里所讲的逻辑规则如‘名词在结论中的外延不得大于前提中的外延’，‘由两个特称前提不能得结论’，‘每一论式中的中名词在两个前提中至少必须周延一次’，‘前提有一为特称结论亦必为特称’，‘前提有一为否定结论亦必为否定’，‘由两个否定前提不能得结论’等等，都只要求规定思维过程；自有形式逻辑以来，就很明确，从不引起有无物质基础的问题”。原因很简单，只因逻辑的物质基础不等于逻辑本身，故把逻辑规律规则等的应用讲清，不涉及其基础，仍不失为形式逻辑。反之，若把不成问题的基础大讲特讲，把规律规则等的应用搁在一边，即讲出一朵花来，亦与形式逻辑的本身无关。所以一切形式逻辑教科书，无论是出自苏联的还是出自资本主义国家的，揭举规律规则后，即讲应用；物质基础，搁而不谈。不谈，并不等于否认，只因不成问题。
    不独止此，就是把不成问题的物质基础谈得很好，像李志才先生所谈的那样，仍与形式逻辑的目的要求不相干。我曾说：“形式逻辑有根据，有对象。肯定了全体亦必肯定其部分等公理，是形式逻辑所必须遵守的根据；张三李四有死无死等事实，是形式逻辑所要推知的对象。我说形式逻辑的规则只是规定思维过程的，对于事物自身没有增加什么说明或解释，所指的是对象。李志才先生便连忙曰，肯定了全体亦必肯定其部分的‘公理就是具体的反映着客观事物所具有的一般与个别的必然联系。’一点不错，这条公理是反映了客观事物之一般与个别的必然联系，可作论式的根据。但问题就在这里：形式逻辑所不可少的根据并不等于所要推知的对象。两者截然有别，不能混为一谈。肯定了全体亦必肯定其部分的公理，是自有形式逻辑以来，千千万万的论式所必遵。难道千千万万的论式所要推知的对象只有一个？意义只有一条吗？对千千万万不同的对象一律赠送它们一条公理曰：肯定了全体亦必肯定其部分，能算对客观事物自身的性质增加了什么说明或解释吗？”江天骥先生说得好：“推论的前提是逻辑地包含结论的”。结论既已逻辑地包含在前提中，请问经过推论形式，究竟增加了什么？答曰，什么也没有增加。逻辑的物质基础对逻辑的目的要求并不发生作用。可见逻辑的物质基础并不等于逻辑本身。
    二、规律和规则等却为形式逻辑所不能少
    逻辑的物质基础虽不等于逻辑本身，但规律规则等却为形式逻辑所不能少。任何一本逻辑教科书都是研究思维过程的；要使思维正确，必须遵守应该遵守的规律和规则。例如，高尔斯基和塔瓦?茨主编的“逻辑”便曰：“逻辑学只是从思想的结构方面，也就是说从思想的逻辑形式方面来研究我们的思想（概念、判断、推理）。它揭示出一些规律和规则。遵守这些规律和规则乃是在获得推出的知识过程中达到真理的必要条件”。又曰：“我们之所以研究逻辑规律和规则，是因为遵守这些规律和规则乃是在获得推出的知识的过程中达到真理的必要条件。”马特则曰：“王方名……认为人们的社会制约性是逻辑规律的客观基础，实际上就是否认逻辑规律是客观外界事物关系在人的思维中的反映，这是违反马克思主义的反映论原理的，而实质上这是现代资产阶级逻辑理论中约定论的翻版”。王方名如何讲，不是我要知道的。但逻辑规律和规则一经由客观事物的关系反映为规律和规则了，对于思维过程，是否具有规定作用或制约作用？如曰有，则一切研究逻辑规律和规则的教科书，包括苏联教科书在内，是否要一律称之为“现代逻辑理论中约定论的翻版”？如曰无，则形式逻辑究竟要研究什么东西？江天骥先生是否定逻辑规律和规则的，他在1957年新建设3月号和4月号里发表长文，一则曰：“推论规则……不是决定推理正确与否的根据”。再则曰：“推论规则只是检查一个推理是否符合逻辑规律的标准，而并不是决定推理正确与否的根据”。三则曰：“一个推理不违反规则，是它正确性的标志；却不能说：这个推理之能够正确，就靠有这些规则”。形式逻辑的规律和规则有物质基础，没有任何人反对；然而为着要强调客观物质基础，竟把从基础反映出来的规律和规则的作用，一并取消，却完全是另一问题。坚持唯物论，是很好的；取消逻辑规律和规则的作用，窃期期以为不可。马特与江先生是同一路线的，自称为“坚持马克思主义逻辑理论的原则”的。难道坚持了马克思主义逻辑理论的原则，就要否定形式逻辑的规律和规则的作用吗？难道苏联的逻辑教科书都是反马克思主义或不坚持马克思主义逻辑理论原则的吗？
    三、要使认识与实践发生关系
    思维过程合乎规则，可以成为正确论式。一个论式的前提与结论间不相矛盾，叫作正确性，属推论范围；前提与事实相一致，叫做真实性，属实践范围。认识的真不真，是各科的事；推论的错不错，是形式逻辑的事。马特不以为然，说我把认识和论证割开了，“要陷于形式主义和唯心主义的泥坑”。其言曰：
    周谷城认为：形式逻辑“的任务重在推论已有的认识或了解”。
    “认识的真不真，是各科的事；推论的错不错，是形式逻辑的事”。
    这就是说，形式逻辑只管表述论证，不管对现实的认识。……论证方法和认识方法虽然有区别，但是又有联系，这两者在形式逻辑中是统一的。论证以认识为依据，离开认识便无从论证。割裂认识和论证，便要陷于形式主义和唯心主义的泥坑。这里我愿稍稍详细讨论一下，看到底谁要陷入泥坑。一，论证方法和认识方法“有区别”云云，是什么意思？我说认识的真不真，是各科的事，意即谓认识要靠各科的实践；推论的错不错，是形式逻辑的事，意即谓论证要靠逻辑的推论。这区别您如认为错了，请把您那对的讲点给我听；如果讲不来，那末所谓“有区别”云云，便是空谈，便是废话，那便是已陷入了形式主义的泥坑。二，论证方法与认识方法“有联系”云云，是什么意思？我说形式逻辑的任务在“推论已有的认识”，意即依据已有的认识作推论；您说“论证以认识为依据”，也是依据已有的认识作推论。请问马特，您我的差别到底在哪里？如果没有差别，为什么您说的就叫两者有联系，我说的就叫两者割开了？三，论证与认识两者在形式逻辑中是“统一的”云云，是什么意思？既曰论证以认识为依据，是两者明明分得开。又曰是“统一的”，则论证以认识为依据云云，还有什么意义？四，论证以认识为依据如果是正确的，那末认识又以什么为依据？如果以实践为依据，明明是您所反对的；如果回转头来，仍以论证为依据，则将陷入循环论证的绝境：论证以认识为依据，认识以论证为依据；周而复始，环循无端！
    口口声声自命为坚持马克思主义的人，一谈到认识，就怕触及实践，一听说认识的真不真要靠各科的实践，就以为人家错了，说是把认识与论证割开。请恕我一句，这里有没有半点马克思主义气息？毛主席在实践论中说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”马特偏不相信实践！不相信实践，便肯相信推论，便肯相信形式逻辑。然而形式逻辑若不与各科结合，究竟能使我们认识什么？认识动物？植物？天文？地理？历史？社会？什么也认识不了。如不相信，请查一查任何逻辑教科书，看它除了规律规则、思维过程和推理形式等，还能给我们什么？反之，若与实践相结合，为各科服务，据已有的认识，进行推论，使前后不矛盾，效用却是显明的。任何科学家在进行研究时，或求真过程中，必须一面问自己所认识的，与客观实在符合不符合，另一方面问所认识的，内容前后矛盾不矛盾。前者属实践范围，后者属论证范围。从实践可得认识，依据认识可作论证。例如“房子里无空气会要闷死人”，这是由实践得出的认识；依此作推论曰，“这间房子无空气，也许要闷死人”，才可以稍稍放松实践。若自始就只许论证与认识发生关系，却不许认识与实践发生关系，这符合马克思主义的理论吗？请问谁陷入了唯心主义的泥坑。
    四、不要制造反对辩证法的理由
    推论的正确，按照逻辑规则做，就可做到。至于认识的真实，亦即充足理由，则完全不然，它不是按照什么一成不变的规则，一动手就做得到的，而是从实践中逐渐做到的。旧话虽有所谓“顿悟”，意即忽然一下晓得；但“顿悟”之前亦必有所谓“渐悟”，意即经过实践逐渐晓得的。人类在求知的过程之中，永远要求真实，永远要求获得充足理由。但为历史条件所限，所知者有时未必完全真实，未必都有充足理由。正因如此，才不断努力，不断实践，以期获得真知，获得充足理由。我在1956年新建设9月号里说：“充足理由为求得真知所不可少，但据以为推者未必都有充足理由。这是古今中外铁一般的事实，不能抹煞。自古至今，凡用形式逻辑宣传自己的主张的人，其主张未必都具备了充足理由。就是首创形式逻辑的亚里士多德本人，也不能例外。亚里士多德是用形式逻辑宣传自己的主张的；他的著作还看得见。请问他的主张有百分之几十具备了充足理由。此后，中世纪的经院学者，近代的资产阶级学者，最近的帝国主义学者，用形式逻辑宣传自己的主张的，更不知有多少人。他们的主张都具备了充足理由吗？不仅如此，就是我们自己，天天用形式逻辑宣传自己的主张，我们能保证自己的主张都具备了百分之百的充足理由吗？例如古史分期，各执一说，都用形式逻辑在宣传自己的主张，他们的主张也未必都具备了百分之百的充足理由咧。”否则学习研究还有什么意义？自由辩论还有什么意义？批判地研究哲学史、思想史等还有什么意义？由相对真理到绝对真理云云还有什么意义？马特不以为然，说我割裂正确性和真实性，把两者完全对立起来，就要导致唯心主义和形式主义。其言曰：
    在思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性的相互关系问题方面，也存在着两种不同的见解。一种见解认为形式逻辑只管思维形式的正确性，而不管思维内容的真实性。在这方面，表示得最坚决、最明确的是周谷城。他认为形式逻辑对任何事物都没有主张。它可以为正确的主张服务，也可以为错误的主张服务。主张有对的和不对的，但是依主张所演出的论式，其自身却可以都是正确的。主张的对和不对，要看它和事实符合不符合；而论式的正确与否，却要看它自身前后矛盾不矛盾。……割裂正确性和真实性，把两者完全对立起来，就要导致唯心主义和形式主义。什么叫“割裂”？应该正确的正确了，应该真实的没有真实，然而两者却联在一块。我们实事求是，如量指出，这叫“割裂”吗？资产阶级曰：“凡生产资料应该私有，大工厂是生产资料，所以大工厂是应该私有的。”这论式违反了形式逻辑的哪一条？曰：任何一条也不违反。错在哪里？曰：不应主张生产资料私有。然则反对私有的是马克思主义，还是形式逻辑？如果是形式逻辑，那末形式逻辑竟成了绝对无上的东西，可以代替马克思主义了！颇闻有人想把形式逻辑绝对化，认为凡合乎形式逻辑的，都是正确的。那好了，马克思主义不必要了，辩证唯物论可以收起了，唯物辩证法更不用提了。果如是者，那世界真的变了，我也要跟着变。但事实上，世界并没有变，形式逻辑还没有绝对化，马克思主义还不能少，辩证唯物论还不能收起；就形式逻辑而论，更需唯物辩证法的领导。把形式逻辑绝对化，认为推论合乎逻辑的，主张就是正确的，那只是反对辩证法的一种借口，只是凭主观愿望制造出来反对唯物辩证法的一种不成理由的理由。马先生！正确性与真实性未必经常是一致的，就是江天骥先生，也曾在1957年3月号和4月号的新建设里“逻辑问题综述”一篇文章中说：“推论决不只是纯形式的推演，却是从真的或假设为真的前提合逻辑地得出结论的过程。……推理一般地不是从断定为假的前提出发的。如果前提是假的，在推理过程中总是被断定或被假设为真”。江先生大概不想反对唯物辩证法，所以还留下这一手：前提就是假的，有时亦无妨假定为真。这就通了。马先生不然，把正确性与真实性死缠在一起，不许分辨清楚，一方面扬言两者有区别，另一方面却又取消这区别，那除坚持反对唯物辩证法的领导外，找不出其他任何理由。
    五、形式逻辑要靠拢唯物辩证法
    前提不真，有时只能假设为真，这是迫不得已，并非心所谓安。然则如何而后可呢？曰：坚持马克思主义的唯物辩证法，实践于所要知道的东西的环境中，比较有办法。当然，熟读马克思主义的书，毫无实践，则除马克思主义的书籍以外，可能一无所知。但重视实践的人，能用马克思主义的唯物辩证法作领导，认识总是可以逐渐真实的。所以我曾不揣冒昧，不止一次地说，形式逻辑要以唯物辩证法为领导：辩证法是主，形式逻辑是从；主从虽有区别，时刻不能分离。尤其是我们同敌人进行论战时，必须坚持这点。形式逻辑，是敌我共同的武器；加上唯物辩证法作领导，情形就不同了，掌握在我们手里的武器的威力，更能好好地发挥。否则以形式逻辑斗形式逻辑，以三段论法斗三段论法，往往陷入了敌人的重围或竟站在敌人一边，而不自觉。例如，沈秉元先生反对美帝在各国建立军事基地，原是一片很好的心肠，人人应该拥护。可是他不用唯物辩证法，仍只乞怜于敌人所同样掌握了的三段论法，大谈三段论法的公理，大谈整体包括部分，大谈书包包括像片、衣袋包括钱的道理；结果他站在敌人一边而不自觉。多么可惜呵！他在1956年新建设7月号里有一段辩论曰：
    为什么同样一种推论，……后一推论（帝国主义在外国建立军事基地是为了本国的安全；那末，美帝国主义在苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的周围建立了军事基地；因此，美帝国主义也是为了本国的安全。）就是荒谬的呢？这还是由于推论本身决定的。三段论法的产生是有它的客观根据的；要阐明这一点，必须从三段论法的公理谈起。三段论法的公理就是：凡是对于整体所肯定的东西，那末对于其部分也是肯定的。凡是对于整体所否定的东西，那末对于其部分也是否定的。这一公理可以作另一种表述，即事物的属性的属性，也就是事物本身的属性。这一三段论法的公理，是由人们千万次的生活实践中总结起来的，好比像片夹在书里，书放在书包里，所以像片就在书包里。再如钱放钱包里，钱包又放在衣袋里，所以钱也在衣袋里。人们根据这些事物的最普通、最常见的关系，总结了三段论法的公理，人们就是根据这些最普通、最常见的公理来进行推理，寻求新知的。所谓肯定了整体，也肯定了部分；所谓书包包括了书里的像片，所谓衣袋包括了钱包里的钱等等，究竟与美帝要在外国建立军事基地，从而也要在人民民主国家周围建立军事基地，有什么不同？拥护美帝，这段文章是足够的；反对美帝，则必于三段论法之上加上唯物辩证法。马特说，沈马等的路线是正确的。不知对这段文章看过没有。如果没有看，就任意下论评，请恕我一句：这对学问未免不忠实；如果看过了，而没有看懂，请再恕我一句：这对学问未免太粗心。马特把我排在修正主义之列，要进行批判；我看这是割鸡用牛刀的办法，殊不值得。还是另行考虑批判对象吧！
