The Story of Big-Character Posters

Like a garden blooming with a hundred flowers, the walls of the Wanglou Agricultural Cooperative Club in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, are covered with red and green big-character posters. The content of these big-character posters includes criticisms and suggestions from the cooperative members towards the cadres, major issues involving the cooperative's production and management, as well as mutual criticism and self-criticism among the masses, even between fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The following are two stories about big-character posters.

Mother's Criticism Was Right

One day, several big-character posters were put up in the agricultural cooperative, all written by the women's production team leader, Yang Shaowen. They read: Yang Sijin, my son, everyone else is in the Great Leap Forward, but you're just wandering around aimlessly....

Yang Sijin went to Hubei as a migrant worker for three months and only recently returned. The cooperative is busy with farm work and needs labor. Unexpectedly, after eating rice for several months outside, Yang Sijin complained that the sweet potato and coarse flour buns at home were not good, and mentioned several times that he wanted to go to Hubei again. One evening, Yang Shaowen returned from the fields and found that her son had already left with his luggage. This made her angry: This child only knows how to enjoy himself, ignoring the needs of the cooperative. I have to expose him so everyone can educate him. So she wrote several big-character posters overnight.

Yang Sijin regretted it halfway there: His performance in labor in the past was not bad; now that everyone is busy with production, he left without a word, what's that about. After struggling with his thoughts several times, he finally turned back.

Yang Shaowen was preparing breakfast when she suddenly stood up when she saw her son return and waved her hand angrily and said, "Don't rush to eat, let's have a small meeting first." Soon, she gathered the team members, and everyone criticized Yang Sijin one after another. Yang Shaowen spoke the most. At this time, someone brought Yang Shaowen's big-character poster. Yang Sijin blushed as he read the big-character poster and immediately expressed his attitude: "Mother, I admit I was wrong; I will definitely not be afraid of hardship or fatigue in the future."

Yang Sijin did not disappoint his mother. At a production team meeting, Yang Shaowen summarized the work and specifically pointed out: "Yang Sijin corrected his mistakes quickly. Now his thinking is stable, his work is enthusiastic, and the quality is high. I hope he will leap forward again." Yang Sijin happily stood up and said, "I will definitely continue to leap forward!"

Accepting Son's Opinion

In the morning, the Eighth Production Team held a meeting at the club. Everyone found a new big-character poster on the wall, which showed a person pushing a small cart with a middle-aged man sitting on it, with a line of words next to it. According to the usual practice, when a new big-character poster was seen, someone would read it aloud to everyone. Today, the accountant read the big-character poster, his voice seemed particularly high: "Wang Jiaxin, as the production team leader, does not take the lead and is always lethargic. Is he still riding a small cart on the road to socialism?! - Wang Zhifa."

Wang Jiaxin was originally the leader of the Eighth Production Team, but he had never been very energetic in his work. Every day, when others got up, he didn't get up; when others went to work, he was still dawdling at home; and he would rest after working for a short time. His son, Wang Zhifa, knew his father's thoughts: There are many people in the family but few laborers, and the income is not as good as others, so he is unhappy; and he thinks being a production team leader is too troublesome and doesn't want to do it well. "What's the use of complaining about others if you don't work hard yourself!" Wang Zhifa often nagged his father, but Wang Jiaxin never took his son's words to heart. Later, Wang Jiaxin was criticized by the team and was also removed from his position as leader. The son thought that his father should correct himself this time; but Wang Jiaxin was still the same, instead saying: "Not being a team leader can save me some worry." In order to help his father make progress, Wang Zhifa posted a big-character poster to let all the commune members help him.

Wang Jiaxin was also present when the big-character poster was read. His face flushed when he heard his son's criticism. At that time, the people next to him patiently gave him some advice. He didn't say anything, but his heart was churning: Everyone's opinions are right, I really haven't worked hard, even my son is criticizing me, I must hurry up and correct myself.

The next day, when Wang Zhifa woke up, it was not yet dawn, but his father had already gone to the fields. (Attached picture)

### 大字报的故事

    大字报的故事
    像百花盛开的园圃一样，河南商丘县王楼农业社俱乐部的四壁，贴满了红红绿绿的大字报。这些大字报的内容，有社员对于干部的批评、建议，有涉及到社内生产和经营管理等方面的重大问题，也有群众之间，以至父子、夫妻、婆媳、兄弟之间的相互批评与自我批评。下面就是两段关于大字报的故事。
    妈妈批评得对
    一天，农业社里贴出了几张大字报，都是妇女生产队长杨少文写的。上面写着：杨思金，我的儿，人家都在大跃进，你却到处乱流窜……。
    杨思金到湖北当民工去了三个月，最近才回来。社里农活忙，正需要劳动力。不料杨思金在外面吃了几个月大米饭，就嫌家里红薯干、粗面馍不好吃，几次提到还要到湖北去。一天晚上，杨少文从地里回来，发觉儿子已经带着行李走了，这一下她可恼了火：这孩子，只知道自己享受，不管社里需要，非揭发他一下不行，让大家来教育他。就这样她连夜就写出了几张大字报。
    杨思金走在半路上，心里又后悔起来：自己过去在劳动中表现并不算坏；现在人家都在忙着生产，自己却不声不响走掉了，像什么话。他思想斗争了几次，最后还是拐了回来。
    杨少文正在准备早饭，一见儿子回来就猛地站了起来，挥挥手生气地说：“别忙着吃饭，先开一个小会再说。”不一会，她就把队里的人都找来了，大家你一句我一句的向杨思金展开了批评。发言最多的还是杨少文。这时，有人把杨少文写的大字报也拿来了，杨思金红着脸看了大字报，当场表示态度：“娘，我承认自己做错了；今后一定不怕苦，不怕累。”
    杨思金没有辜负他母亲的期望，在一次生产队的会议上，杨少文总结了工作，还特别提出：“杨思金改正错误快，现在思想安定，干活热火，质量又高，希望他跃进再跃进。”杨思金高兴得马上站起来说：“一定继续跃进！”
    接受儿子的意见
    早晨，第八生产队在俱乐部开会，大家发现墙上新贴了一张大字报，上面画着一个人推一辆小车，车上坐着一个中年男人，旁边还写了一行字。按照平时的习惯，见了新的大字报就由一个人念一遍给大家听听。今天会计念大字报，声音似乎提得特别高：“王家信当生产队长不带头，整天暮气沉沉，他还在坐小车走社会主义呢！——王治法”。
    王家信本来是第八生产队的队长，干起活来一直劲头不大，每天别人起床了，他不起来；别人上工了，他还在家里磨蹭；干活也是干不大一会儿，就休息了。他的儿子王治法知道父亲的思想：家里人多劳力少，收入不如人家，心里有些不乐意；又嫌当生产队长太麻烦，不想好好干。“自己不好好劳动，尽埋怨别人有什么用呢”！王治法常常钉着他父亲嘟哝，王家信却从来没有把儿子的话放在心上。后来王家信被队里批评了一次，还撤销了他队长的职务。儿子以为父亲这下子可该改正了；可是王家信还是老样子，反而说：“不当队长倒可以少操一些心。”王治法为了父亲进步，贴了一张大字报，让全体社员来帮助他。
    念大字报的时候王家信也在场。他听到儿子的批评，脸上一阵通红。那时旁边的人也耐心地给他提了一些意见。他嘴里不吭气心里却在翻腾：大家提的意见都对，我确实没有好好劳动，连儿子都批评我了，我还不赶快改正。
    第二天，王治法醒来的时候，天还没有亮，他父亲却早已下地去了。（附图片）
