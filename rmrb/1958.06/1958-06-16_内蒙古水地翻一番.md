With Soaring Enthusiasm to Conquer the Bitter Cold
    Inner Mongolia's Irrigated Land Doubles
    Averaging Three Mu of Irrigated Land Per Agricultural Resident
    Now, Utilizing the Lulls in Farm Work to Launch a New High Tide of Water Conservancy Construction

    (Reported by our correspondent Zhao Yongxi) The farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in the water conservancy construction movement of last winter and this spring, have mustered revolutionary enthusiasm and worked hard. By the end of May, they had completed the expansion of irrigated farmland by 10.5 million mu. Together with the original 12 million mu of irrigated land, the region's 6.85 million agricultural residents now have an average of more than three mu of irrigated land per person. The irrigation area for fodder bases and pastures in pastoral areas has also expanded from 30,000 mu to 520,000 mu, and the number of livestock supplied with water has increased from 3.1 million head to 4.6 million head.

    Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: Starting this year, regardless of drought or flood, we can have surplus grain to hand over to the state to support the socialist construction of the motherland.

    From October last year to the end of May this year, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia contributed nearly 100 million labor days and completed over 230 million cubic meters of earthwork. They built more than 32,000 large and small canals, dug and renovated more than 48,000 new and old wells, built more than 2,200 various small reservoirs, more than 5,300 pond and dam projects, dug more than 1,200 springs, and many other projects such as through-river wells and submerged rivers, which can expand the clean water irrigation area by 10.5 million mu. This represents an early completion and a 5% overfulfillment of the annual plan (10 million mu). The irrigated area completed in eight months from one winter to one spring is equivalent to more than 87% of the total irrigated area in the two hundred years before 1957. At the same time, various places have also expanded the flood irrigation area by more than 1.64 million mu, improved the original irrigation area by more than 3.11 million mu, completed the drainage area of more than 770,000 mu, and initially controlled an area of soil and water conservation of more than 4,300 square kilometers. In pastoral areas, more than 2,900 water wells have been dug and 30 springs have been excavated, which can solve the drinking water problem for 1.5 million head of livestock and expand the irrigation area of fodder bases and pastures by 480,000 mu.

    Inner Mongolia is located in the northern border of our country, and the winter is cold and frozen. Can we carry out comprehensive construction? No one had ever dared to think about it in the past. Last winter, before the high tide of water conservancy construction, the Party and government leading organs in various places, through the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, adopted various forms of meetings to organize the masses to launch a great airing of views, a great debate, and thoroughly implemented the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the principle of "storage as the main focus, small-scale projects as the main focus, and community-run projects as the main focus" for farmland water conservancy to the production teams of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. This greatly liberated the thinking of the masses. The Party committee secretaries in various places took the lead personally, with one heart and one mind from top to bottom, and the broad masses of people bravely put forward combat slogans such as "Heavy snow cannot stop the ambitious, and the frozen ground cannot catch up with firm determination" and "The frozen ground is as hard as a rock, and the hearts of the people are like steel," and universally adopted methods such as "Using iron hammers to break frozen blocks, and using wooden rammers to soften the soil" and "People are free, but tools are not idle, working day and night in shifts, not letting the soil freeze solid." They launched a tenacious struggle against the severe cold of minus thirty or forty degrees, and everywhere there was a scene of "a sea of red (flags) in the daytime and a sea of light (lamps) at night." In the arid areas of Zhaowuda League, there is no surface water, so the masses dug wells and built flood storage reservoirs to use snow water for irrigation. In some mountainous areas without water sources, the masses tried every means to bring water to the high mountains. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Jerim League, there are many sand dunes, so the masses cut off the sand dunes, dug canals to divert water, and greatly developed paddy fields. In pastoral areas where livestock lack drinking water, herdsmen dug wells and excavated springs. On both banks of the Xiliao River, flood control was carried out every year before liberation, and floods occurred every year. Flood control began after liberation, and since last year, the masses have no longer been afraid of floods. They joined forces to build a very large flood detention reservoir between Tongliao and Kailu, and they want to store floods for use and divert floods for irrigation. The Hetao Irrigation Area of the Yellow River has abundant water sources, but the irrigation methods are backward, causing soil salinization and low grain yields. Under the leadership of the Party and government leading organs, the local masses launched a large-scale leveling and dam-building campaign, finally enabling the entire region to achieve ridge irrigation and furrow irrigation, changing the phenomenon of flood irrigation.

    Originally, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Department formulated the target of expanding the irrigated area by 2 million mu in 1958, but the soaring enthusiasm of the masses repeatedly broke through this, from 2 million mu to 3 million mu, 5.7 million mu, 6.6 million mu, and finally leaped to 10 million mu, striving for 12 million mu. Now the plan of 10 million mu has been broken through again. Recently, the person in charge of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Department told reporters: Under the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction of the Party, a new high tide of water conservancy construction has recently appeared in the rural areas of Inner Mongolia. Since the end of May, from the Ordos Grassland to the mountainous areas north and south of the Yin Mountains, and to the Songliao Plain on the southeastern foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, hundreds of thousands of farmers of all ethnic groups, using the gap of about forty days from spring sowing to summer hoeing, continue to march towards water conservancy with greater enthusiasm. It is estimated that by the end of September this year, the agricultural areas of the region can complete the expansion of the irrigated area by 15 million mu, of which the area benefiting in the current year can reach about 12 million mu. When talking about the development prospects of water conservancy construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the person in charge said: It now seems that by 1960, farmland water conservancy will be developed to 45 million mu to 50 million mu, basically realizing water conservancy; in pastoral areas, all livestock water supply will be solved in five years, and waterless pastures will be eliminated, which is completely achievable.

It diverts the flow of water and removes sediment, which can reduce the amount of sediment in the diverted water.

    冲天干劲征服天寒地冻
    内蒙古水地翻一番
    农业人口平均每人已拥有水地三亩
    现正利用农忙间隙掀起新的水利建设高潮
    本报讯　记者赵永西报道：内蒙古自治区各族农牧民在去冬今春兴修水利运动中，鼓足革命干劲，大干特干。到5月底止，已经完成农田扩灌面积一千零五十万亩，连同原有一千二百万亩水地，全区六百八十五万农业人口平均每人已经有三亩多水地；牧区饲料基地和牧场的灌溉面积也由三万亩扩大到五十二万亩，解决牲畜供水头数由三百一十万头增加到四百六十万头。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫说：从今年开始，无论天旱雨涝，我们都可以有余粮向国家上缴，支援祖国社会主义建设。
    从去年10月开始到今年5月底，内蒙古农业区各族农民共付出将近一亿个劳动工日，完成土方二亿三千多万公方，共修成大小渠道三万二千多条，打新井和整修旧井四万八千多眼，修建各种小型水库二千二百多座，塘坝工程五千三百多处，挖泉一千二百多眼，以及其他许多透河井、伏流水等工程，共可扩大清水灌溉面积一千零五十万亩，提前并超额5％完成了年度计划（一千万亩）。一冬一春八个月时间所完成的灌溉面积等于1957年以前二百年来的灌溉面积总和的87％强。与此同时，各地还扩大洪水灌溉面积一百六十四万多亩，改善原有灌溉面积三百一十一万亩，完成排涝面积七十七万多亩，水土保持初步控制面积四千三百多平方公里。牧区，打水井达二千九百多眼，掏泉三十个，可以解决一百五十万头牲畜饮水，并扩大饲料基地和牧场的灌溉面积四十八万亩。
    内蒙古地处我国北部边疆，冬季天寒地冻，能否全面施工？过去从来没人敢想过。去年冬季，在水利建设高潮以前，各地党政领导机关通过全民整风和社会主义教育运动，采取各种会议形式，就这个问题组织群众展开大鸣大放大辩论，把中共中央八届三中全会精神和农田水利的“以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主”方针一直贯彻到农业社和牧业社的生产队，大大解放了群众的思想，各地党委书记普遍亲自挂帅，上下一条心，拧成一股绳，广大群众勇敢地提出：“雪大挡不住有志人，地冻赶不上决心硬”、“地冻坚如石，人心似钢铁”等等战斗口号，普遍采用“铁锤打冻块，木夯夯化土”和“人闲工具不闲，日夜轮班干，不让土冻坚”等办法，与零下三、四十度的严寒展开了顽强的搏斗，到处出现“白天一片红（旗），夜晚一片明（灯）的日夜施工景象。昭乌达盟干旱地区没有地表水，群众就打井，修蓄洪库，利用雪水灌溉；有些山区没有水源，群众想尽一切办法把水引上了高山；哲里木盟半农半牧区，沙垛子多，群众就砍断沙垛子，开渠引水，大量发展了稻田。牧区牲畜饮水不足，牧民就打井、掏泉。西辽河两岸，解放前年年防洪，年年被淹，解放后开始治洪，而从去年开始，群众不再怕洪了，他们联合起来，在通辽到开鲁间兴修一个规模很大的滞洪库，他们要蓄洪用洪，引洪灌溉。黄河后套灌区水源充足，可是灌溉方法很落后，引起土地碱化，粮食产量不高，当地群众在党政领导机关领导下展开大规模的平地打堰活动，终于使全区实现畦灌和沟灌，改变了大水漫灌的现象。
    原来内蒙古自治区水利部门制订的1958年扩大灌溉面积指标是二百万亩，结果被群众的冲天干劲一再突破，由二百万亩到三百万亩、五百七十万亩、六百六十万亩，最后跃进到一千万亩，争取一千二百万亩。现在一千万亩的计划又被突破了。最近，内蒙古自治区水利部门负责人对记者说：在党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，一个新的水利建设高潮，最近又在内蒙古各地农村出现了。从5月下旬开始，从鄂尔多斯草原到阴山南北山区，直到大兴安岭东南麓的松辽平原，数十万各族农民，利用春播后到夏锄前约四十天的空隙，以更大的干劲继续向水利进军。估计到今年9月底，全区农业区可以完成扩灌面积一千五百万亩，其中当年受益面积约可达到一千二百万亩。谈到内蒙古自治区水利建设发展远景时，这位负责人说：现在看来，到1960年，农田水利发展到四千五百万亩到五千万亩，基本实现水利化；牧区五年全部解决牲畜供水，消灭无水草场，是完全可以做到的。（附图片）
