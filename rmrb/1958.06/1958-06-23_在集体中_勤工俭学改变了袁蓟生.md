    In the Collective
    ——Work-Study Changes Yuan Jisheng
    By Our Reporter Lin Mo
    
    The students of Shenyang Building Materials Industry School feel that teacher Yuan Jisheng has become a different person during the work-study program.
    
    In the past, Mr. Yuan would grab his books and go home as soon as class was over. At home, he had his own little world, and he was interested in listening to music, playing mahjong, and playing with his camera... When he first left school a few years ago, Yuan Jisheng still had some youthful energy. When he first became a teacher, he also wanted to teach well, but he quickly regarded teaching as a plain and ordinary profession, losing his sense of novelty towards things. He didn't pay much attention to politics, rarely participated in collective activities, and had nothing to say at meetings. He lived a somewhat listless life.
    
    The school enthusiastically launched a work-study program, and Yuan Jisheng and another teacher were assigned to be technical instructors in the school's mechanical factory, responsible for arranging and planning the entire factory's production and solving equipment and various technical problems. The factory's production, like a transmission belt, pulled Yuan Jisheng into the vortex of a tense collective life. Students constantly came to him, and problems poured in front of him one by one. If he didn't pay attention somewhere, loopholes would immediately appear, affecting production. He had to work hard and go all out. When the students worked, they were in high spirits and full of energy, overjoyed to see the products they made for the first time. A warm and boiling atmosphere of life surrounded and infected Yuan Jisheng. When problems arose in production, he suffered with everyone; when achievements were made, he rejoiced with everyone. The factory lacked a sawing machine and couldn't cut materials, which threatened to affect production. A new sawing machine would cost 2,000 yuan, which the school couldn't afford. Yuan Jisheng was troubled by this and couldn't sleep all night. The next day, he found some waste materials everywhere, bought a belt for only a few dozen yuan, and made a simple sawing machine. This solved the problem, and the students congratulated him warmly. He lived in this collective with excitement, feeling that his thoughts were connected with everyone. In the past, when he was teaching, he would be unhappy if students sometimes asked him for extra tutoring, as it would affect his listening to music. But now when he worked, he didn't care about the time at all. The factory produced for sixteen hours a day, with students working in two shifts. Yuan Jisheng, however, worked until the end of one shift, often not returning home until late at night, spending almost all his time in the factory except for eating and sleeping. The school leaders, to take care of his health, did not allow him to do this. But he felt that there were many things that needed to be done, and he couldn't bear to leave the factory. He gradually developed a great interest in production, feeling very happy when he saw the things being produced. Sometimes he felt like he was missing something if he didn't go to the factory on Sundays. Yuan Jisheng also did a side job when he was teaching – translating books in cooperation with others. At that time, he felt that staying up late to do this was meaningless, and he never wanted to do it again after he had done it once. But now when he worked, he was full of energy, not feeling tired even working late at night, and wanting to do more after finishing one thing.
    
    In the factory, he specifically learned the fine qualities of the working class from some veteran technicians. The most impressive person was Master Hu from the casting workshop. Master Hu always did the hardest and heaviest work himself, and always stood in front of dangerous things. He was wholeheartedly for production and never considered personal gains or losses. Master Hu said to the students: When lifting iron pots to pour castings, if the molten iron splashes on you, don't panic or drop the iron pot, otherwise it will hurt others. Sometimes, when casting problems occurred, Master Hu would step on the hot sand with one foot. The students talked about this with amazement, but Master Hu thought it was very common. He said: "If my shoes are burned, they can be repaired, and if my feet are burned, they can be treated, but if the casting is ruined, it will be destroyed."
    
    Sometimes when Yuan Jisheng was tired from working at night, and he would doze off somewhere, the selfless and fearless image of Master Hu would appear before his eyes. Yuan Jisheng said that in the past he often talked about strengthening collectivist ideology and learning the fine qualities of the working class, but at that time, these words were empty. Only through practice and experience did these words have practical meaning.

### 在集体中——勤工俭学改变了袁蓟生

    在集体中
    ——勤工俭学改变了袁蓟生
    本报记者  林沫
    沈阳建筑材料工业学校的同学，在勤工俭学活动中觉得袁蓟生老师变成了另外一个人。
    过去呢，袁老师一下课就夹起书本走回家去了。在家里有他自己生活的小天地，他感到兴趣的是听听音乐，打打雀牌，玩玩照像机……。几年前刚出学校时，袁蓟生总还有些青年气，初当教师时，他也曾想要把书教好，但是很快地，他就把教书当成了一种平平淡淡的职业，对事物失去了新鲜的感觉。他不大关心政治，很少参加集体活动，开起会来也没什么言可发。生活着，有些暮气沉沉。
    学校热烈地开展了勤工俭学活动，袁蓟生同另外一个教师被分配作校内机械工厂的技术指导员，负责安排筹划全厂的生产，解决设备和各种技术问题。工厂的生产像一条传动带一样，把袁蓟生卷进紧张的集体生活的漩涡里。同学们不断地来找他，问题一个个涌到他面前；什么地方注意不到，就马上出现漏洞，影响生产。他不得不紧张地工作，全力以赴。同学们干起活来，情绪高，劲头大，见到自己初次制造的产品欢欣若狂。一种热烈沸腾的生活气氛包围和感染着袁蓟生。生产出了问题，他和大家一起苦恼；创造出成绩，他和大家共同欢乐。工厂里缺少锯床，没法下料，眼看要影响生产。一台新锯床要两千元，学校买不起，袁蓟生为这事苦恼着，一夜没睡着。第二天，他到处找来些废料，只花几十元钱买了一条皮带，就作出了一架简单的锯床。这一下问题解决了，同学们热烈地祝贺他。他以激动的心情生活在这个集体里，感到自己同大家心思相通。过去教书时，同学有时在课外找他辅导，影响他听音乐心里就不乐意。但是现在工作起来，根本不计较时间。工厂每天生产十六小时，同学们是两班倒换。袁蓟生却是一班干到底，经常深夜才回家，每天除吃饭、睡觉，差不多把全部时间都放在工厂里。学校领导上为照顾他的健康，不允许他这样作。但他感到有许多事需要作，自己总舍不得走出工厂。他渐渐对生产发生了极大的兴趣，看到生产出的东西满心愉快。有时星期天不到工厂去，就感到好像丢了什么东西。袁蓟生过去教书时也搞过副业——同人合作翻译书。那时他觉得熬夜干这件事没有意思，干过之后就再也不愿干了。但是现在工作起来，却劲头十足，干到深夜不觉累，干完一件还想干。
    他在工厂里，从一些老技工那里具体领会到了工人阶级的优良品质。给他印象最深刻的是铸造车间的胡师傅。胡师傅对最苦最重的活总是自己干，遇到危险的事总是自己站在前面。他一心为了生产，从不考虑个人得失。胡师傅对同学们说：在抬起铁罐浇铸件的时候，万一铁水点洒在自己身上，千万不要着慌或撩下铁罐，不然就要伤害别人。有时当浇铸发生毛病的时候，胡师傅就一脚踏在火热的沙子上。同学们谈起这事惊叹不止，但胡师傅却认为这事很平常。他说：“自己的鞋子烧坏了可以补，脚烧坏了可以医好，铸件闹坏可就毁了。”
    袁蓟生有时夜里工作得累了，歪在什么地方睡一会，胡师傅那种大公无私、奋不顾身的忘我的形象就会出现在他的眼前。袁蓟生说，过去也常讲加强集体主义思想，学习工人阶级的优良品质，但那时讲这话是空洞的，只有在实践中有所体会，这话才有实际意义。
