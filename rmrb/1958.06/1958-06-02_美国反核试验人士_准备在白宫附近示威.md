Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 31st - According to TASS: Many American peace activists are preparing to hold a demonstration near the White House on June 1st to protest the U.S. government's continued nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. They are heading towards Washington D.C., the American capital, from states such as Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, and from New York and Chicago, some on foot, others by car. Along the way, they are collecting signatures on petitions to U.S. President Eisenhower. The petition demands an immediate end to the testing and production of nuclear weapons.

Ordinary Americans are increasingly and strongly demanding an end to nuclear weapons testing. They are writing letters to members of Congress to express their views.

Mrs. Mosner of Litchfield, New Jersey, requested in a letter that the U.S. government seek an agreement to halt nuclear weapons testing.

Roland and Carolina Olum of Oakridge, Oregon, wrote: "The United States should unconditionally stop nuclear weapons testing... Do we have the moral right to risk the health and lives of future generations because of our current imprudence?"

    美国反核试验人士
    准备在白宫附近示威
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国许多和平人士准备在6月1日在白宫附近举行示威游行，抗议美国政府在太平洋继续试验核武器。他们正在从马里兰、弗吉尼亚、特拉华等州，从纽约和芝加哥向美国首都华盛顿进发，有的步行，有的乘汽车。他们沿途征集人民在给美国总统艾森豪威尔的请愿书上签名。请愿书中要求立刻停止试验和停止生产核武器。
    普通的美国人正在日益强烈地要求停止核武器试验。他们纷纷给国会议员写信表达自己的意见。
    新泽西州利支菲尔德的莫斯纳女士在信中要求美国政府谋求达成停止核武器试验的协议。
    俄勒同州奥克里治的罗兰和卡罗莉娜·奥鲁姆写道：“美国应当无条件地停止核武器试验……我们是否在道义上有权因为我们现在的不明智而拿子孙后代的健康和生命来冒险呢？”
