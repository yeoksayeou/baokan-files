    Red Flowers Bloom on the 05 Line
    Yan Ming
    Propaganda Activist
    Under the blazing sun,
    In the storm,
    She puts down the carrying pole,
    And picks up the pen.
    She spreads the good news,
    Throughout our construction site,
    Writes good poems,
    And also writes witty clappertalk.
    Under the blazing sun,
    In the storm,
    She puts down the pen,
    And picks up the carrying pole.
    Red flowers bloom on the 05 Line
    Red flowers bloom on the 05 Line,
    A hero is right before our eyes,
    Communist Party member Li Zhaoxian,
    Shovels dirt, ah, as fast as flying,
    Carries dirt, ah, as light as a swallow.
    On the loading platform
    Basket after basket of gravel,
    Basket after basket of fresh flowers,
    Gravel piled high on the four branch lines,
    Fresh flowers bloom in our hearts.
    Basket after basket of gravel,
    Basket after basket of fresh flowers,
    Load the gravel into the dump trucks,
    Offer the fresh flowers to the dam.

    红花开在○五线
    晏明
    宣传鼓动员
    在烈日下面，
    在暴风雨里，
    她放下扁担，
    又举起笔杆。
    她把好消息，
    传遍咱工地，
    写完好诗篇，
    又写小快板。
    在烈日下面，
    在暴风雨里，
    她放下笔杆，
    又扛起扁担。
    红花开在○五线
    红花开在○五线，
    好汉就在咱眼前，
    共产党员李兆先，
    铲土呵，快如飞，
    挑土呵，轻似燕。
    在装料台上
    一筐一筐砂石，
    一篮一篮鲜花，
    砂石堆满四支线，
    鲜花怒放在心间。
    一筐一筐砂石，
    一篮一篮鲜花，
    把砂石装满斗车，
    把鲜花献给大坝。
