Xinhua News Agency, June 26th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. government continues to resort to massively increasing military orders in an attempt to alleviate the economic crisis.

According to this month's issue of "U.S. News & World Report," in the third quarter of last year, U.S. government military orders, calculated at an annual rate, were $8.6 billion; in the fourth quarter, $15.6 billion; in the first quarter of this year, $18.7 billion; and currently, they have increased to $22 billion.

In the 1958 fiscal year ending June 30th, U.S. Department of Defense expenditures will reach $39.7 billion, an increase of more than $1 billion over the original plan. According to U.S. newspapers on the 23rd, the Department of Defense now intends to increase military spending to approximately $41 billion next year and to $42 billion by 1960. Defense Secretary McElroy said that the U.S. military budget may increase to $60 or $70 billion annually in the next ten years.

Although an important purpose of the U.S. government's massive increase in military spending and military orders is to stimulate the economy and alleviate the crisis, according to U.S. newspapers, the U.S. economy has not shown any real signs of improvement so far, and a "sluggish period" will appear in the summer, with unemployment rising to nearly six million people (referring to official figures), the highest peak in more than a decade.

    企图用扩军备战办法缓和经济危机
    美国政府军事订货激增
    美报承认今年夏季失业人数将达六百万人
    据新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府继续乞灵于大量增加军事订货，企图以此来缓和经济危机。
    据本月份一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，在去年第三季，美国政府的军事订货以年率计算是八十六亿美元，第四季是一百五十六亿美元，今年第一季是一百八十七亿美元，而目前已增加到二百二十亿美元。
    在今年6月30日结束的1958财政年度内，美国国防部的开支将达到三百九十七亿美元，比原定计划增加了十多亿美元。据美国报刊23日说，国防部现在还打算把明年的军事开支增加到约四百一十亿美元，到1960年再增加到四百二十亿美元。国防部长麦克耳罗伊说，美国的军事预算在今后十年中还可能增加到每年六百或七百亿美元。
    尽管美国政府大量增加军事开支和军事订货的一个重要目的是刺激经济，缓和危机，但是据美国报刊报道，美国经济迄今并没有真正好转的迹象，在夏季还将出现一个“呆滞时期”，失业人数将上升到近六百万人（指官方数字）的十多年来的最高峰。
