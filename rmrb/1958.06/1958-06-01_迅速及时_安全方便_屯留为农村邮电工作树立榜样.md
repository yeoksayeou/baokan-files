Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 31st. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently held an on-site symposium in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, to exchange experiences in rural postal and telecommunications work. At the meeting, representatives from five provinces and autonomous regions focused on studying how to make rural postal and telecommunications work adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and achieve "prompt and accurate, safe and convenient," and fully exchanged experiences in this regard.

The representatives from various regions were greatly interested in the experience of the staff of the Tunliu County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, located in the Taiyue Mountains, who, with the revolutionary spirit of bold thinking, bold action, mutual cooperation, and relying on the masses, overcame the difficulties of high mountains, long roads, and inconvenient transportation, and made the collection and delivery work "prompt, accurate, safe, and convenient." At present, in the rural areas of Tunliu County, which covers more than 1,200 square kilometers, more than 300 postal and telecommunications offices, agency offices, receiving and dispatching stations, letter and newspaper collection points, mailboxes, etc. have been established, and mail and newspapers can arrive in the townships and cooperatives on the same day. The county is also generally establishing a system of agricultural cooperative postmen, and direct delivery of mail and newspapers to households will be realized before the end of June. The masses praised: "It is possible to deposit and withdraw parcels and remit funds in the market towns, send letters without leaving the village, and have letters delivered to the door. Subscribing to newspapers and periodicals in townships and cooperatives saves labor and money." In order to solve the contradiction between the small number of rural postal workers and the expanding scope of business, the staff, on the one hand, launched a competition among internal and external staff in the spirit of mutual cooperation to "everyone learns to do a variety of labor," and on the other hand, entrusted the accountants, feeders, and custodians of agricultural cooperatives to serve as collectors and deliverers, and widely solicited the opinions and requirements of the masses through various forms of visits such as door-to-door visits, letters, and counters. They also established a card inspection system. In this way, they not only ensured prompt and accurate collection and delivery, but also had no backlog or loss in more than three years, and were repeatedly selected as advanced units in the country and the province by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Shanxi Provincial Post and Telecommunications Bureau.

At the meeting, the representatives unanimously proposed to take the Tunliu County Post and Telecommunications Bureau as a learning model, and formulated a leap forward plan, and put forward a proposal to fraternal post offices across the country to carry out friendship competitions.

More than 40 representatives from five provinces and autonomous regions, including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hebei, participated in this meeting.

    迅速及时　安全方便
    屯留为农村邮电工作树立榜样
    新华社太原31日电　邮电部最近在山西省屯留县举行了农村邮电工作经验交流现场座谈会。会上，五个省、自治区的代表，着重研究了如何使农村邮电工作适应当前工农业生产大跃进新形势，做到“迅速准确，安全方便”等问题，并充分交流了这方面的经验。
    各地代表对地处太岳山区中的屯留县邮电局职工们以大胆想、大胆干、互相协作、依靠群众的革命精神，克服了山高路远、交通不便的困难，使收递工作做到了“迅速准确，安全方便”的经验，感到极大的兴趣。目前，在屯留县一千二百多平方公里的农村里，已经建立了三百多处邮电所、代办所、收发站、信报代收点、信箱等，邮件报刊当日就可到达乡、社。全县还正在普遍建立农业社邮递员制度，6月底以前将实现邮件报刊直投到户。群众赞扬说：“集镇寄取包裹又能汇兑款，邮信不出村，来信送上门，乡、社订报刊，省工又省钱。”为了解决乡邮人员少和业务范围日渐扩大的矛盾，职工们一方面以互相协作的精神在内勤和外勤人员之间展开了“人人学会做多种劳动”的竞赛，一方面委托农业社的会计、饲养员、保管员兼任收投工作，并通过登门、写信、柜台等多种访问形式，广泛征求群众的意见和要求，还建立了卡片检查制度。这样他们不仅保证了收投迅速、准确，而且三年多来没有发生过积压和丢失等现象，曾连续三次被邮电部和山西省邮电局评选为全国和全省的先进单位。
    会议上，各地代表一致提出要以屯留县邮电局为学习榜样，并制订了跃进计划，向全国兄弟邮局提出了开展友谊竞赛的倡议。
    参加这次会议的有山西、内蒙古、陕西、河南、河北等五个省和自治区的代表，共四十多人。
