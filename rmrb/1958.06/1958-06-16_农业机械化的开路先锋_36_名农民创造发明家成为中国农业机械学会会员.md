Xinhua News Agency, June 15th.贺 He Ting and 35 other farmer inventors have been admitted as members of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. On the morning of June 15th, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery held an admission ceremony for the new members in Beijing. This is another piece of good news for the development of the agricultural science team, following the hiring of "native experts" as special researchers by the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The 36 farmer inventors who were admitted to the Agricultural Machinery Society this time are: Mao Qichang, Gong Peizhi, Bian Weixiang, Zhang Fulai, Yang Shouyi, Sun Fengqian, Hu Xiuqing, Xia Wanyou, Zhang Hongbin, and Zhang Wusheng from Anhui Province; He Ting, Chen Fatian, Wang Shujin, Ma Faxi, Wang Yuzhen, Gong Yunchang, Ma Lianchen, Yue Yongchao, Zhang Guangyi, and Wang Yushun from Henan Province; Zhang Hongtang and Wang Jianmin from Hebei Province; Wang Shenggui, Chen Shengguo, and Meng Zhaolin from Shanxi Province; Zhu Yuankai from Heilongjiang Province; Xiang Guangzhang, Xu Zhenwu, and Gong Guangyan from Hubei Province; Peng Zongshun from Sichuan Province; Wang Keshu, Chen Jinru, and Xu Chuanqian from Yunnan Province; Zhou Shengxin from Fujian Province; Tang Xieneng from Guangdong Province; and Wei Li from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They have all achieved success in creating and inventing agricultural tools during the agricultural tool reform movement.

At the admission ceremony for the new members, Chen Bochuan, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery, and Wu Juenong, member of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered speeches respectively. Chen Bochuan said that the admission of He Ting and others as members is an important page in the history of the Agricultural Machinery Society. The Agricultural Machinery Society has very few personnel, but there are many people actually engaged in agricultural machinery work. The Council of the Agricultural Machinery Society has decided to change its past conservative style and extensively absorb workers and peasants who have made creative contributions to agricultural technological innovation to participate in this organization, in order to expand the ranks of agricultural machinery workers. He hoped that new and old members would unite to promote the development of agricultural mechanization faster and better. Wu Juenong said in his speech that only by breaking superstitions and combining agricultural science and technology with the broad masses of workers and peasants can the cause of agricultural mechanization develop well. He hoped that agricultural science workers would learn from farmer inventors and that everyone would improve together.

The new members He Ting, Zhang Fulai, Bian Weixiang, Mao Qichang, Gong Peizhi, and Chen Fatian attended today's admission ceremony. After receiving their membership certificates, they spoke, expressing their great joy at being absorbed into the ranks of agricultural science. They said that this honor was given by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They unanimously expressed that they would study culture and technology well in the future, study diligently, and continue to reform and create more and better agricultural tools.

Some members of the Agricultural Machinery Society – experts, professors, and technicians in agricultural machinery in Beijing – who attended the admission ceremony for the new members congratulated the farmer experts on joining the society and congratulated the Agricultural Machinery Society on increasing its new strength. They also expressed that they would learn from the farmer experts and learn from the masses, so that our country's agricultural mechanization cause could leap forward faster.

    农业机械化的开路先锋
    36名农民创造发明家成为中国农业机械学会会员
    新华社15日讯　贺亭等三十六名农民创造发明家被中国农业机械学会筹备委员会吸收为会员。15日上午，中国农业机械学会筹委会在北京举行了新会员的入会仪式。这是中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所聘请“土专家”为特约研究员后，农业科学队伍发展的又一喜讯。
    这次被吸收参加农业机械学会的三十六名农民创造发明家是：安徽省的毛其昌、龚培芝、卞维祥、张福来、杨守义、孙凤钱、胡秀清、夏万友、张洪彬、张五生，河南省的贺亭、陈法田、王书金、马发喜、王玉振、巩云长、马连臣、岳永朝、张广义、王玉顺，河北省的张鸿堂、王建民，山西省的王盛贵、陈盛国、孟兆麟，黑龙江省的朱元开，湖北省的向光章、徐祯武、龚光炎，四川省的彭宗顺，云南省的王克书、陈金如、徐川前，福建省的周盛新，广东省的唐协能和内蒙古自治区的卫立。他们都是在农具改革运动中创造发明农具有成绩的。
    在新会员入会仪式上，中国农业机械学会筹备委员会秘书长陈伯川和全国科联全国委员吴觉农分别讲了话。陈伯川说，吸收贺亭等为会员，是农业机械学会历史上重要的一页。农业机械学会人员很少，而目前实际参加农业机械工作的人却很多。农业机械学会理事会决定改变过去的保守作风，大量吸收对农业技术革新有创造贡献的工农群众参加这一团体，来扩大农业机械工作人员的队伍。他希望新旧会员团结起来，更快更好地促进农业机械化事业的发展。吴觉农在讲话中说，只有破除迷信，使农业科学技术与广大工农群众结合起来，农业机械化事业才能很好的发展，他希望农业科学工作者向农民创造发明家学习，大家共同提高。
    新会员贺亭、张福来、卞维祥、毛其昌、龚培芝、陈法田参加了今天的入会仪式，他们在接受了会员证后，分别讲了话，对他们被吸收成为农业科学队伍中的一员，表示十分高兴。他们说这荣誉是共产党和毛主席给的，他们一致表示，今后要好好学习文化和技术，苦钻苦学，继续改革和创造更多更好的农具。
    参加新会员入会仪式的一些农业机械学会会员——北京农业机械方面的专家、教授和技术人员等在发言中祝贺农民专家入会，祝贺农业机械化学会增加了新生的力量。他们也纷纷表示，要向农民专家学习、向群众学习，让我国的农业机械化事业更快地跃进。
