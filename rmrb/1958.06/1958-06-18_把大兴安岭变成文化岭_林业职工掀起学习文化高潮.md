Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 16th: Forestry system workers in the Greater Khingan Range of Inner Mongolia have launched a high tide of "thousands teaching ten thousands to learn," marching towards culture, aiming to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people before National Day, turning the Greater Khingan Range into a "Range of Culture" as a gift to National Day.

Currently, more than 17,000 workers are studying in literacy classes, higher primary school classes, junior high school, and senior high school classes. Among them, more than 10,000 are studying in literacy classes, and 95% of young and middle-aged illiterate people have enrolled. According to preliminary statistics, more than 500 former semi-literate individuals from two bureaus have actively studied in the short term and recently obtained literacy graduation certificates and have been promoted to higher primary school classes.

In addition to six hours of concentrated classes per week, the students in each study class also organized many "mutual teaching and mutual learning" groups based on the spirit of being a teacher for one word learned and a student for one word not known; in addition, there are many small "package teaching and package learning" groups for learning anytime, anywhere.

The Xiniqi Workers' Children's Primary School organized a children's literacy team. The children set up "cultural posts" at key intersections. When worker uncles came along, they would stop them to recognize characters and immediately teach them any unfamiliar characters. Some students also made agreements with illiterate people around their residences, delivering character blocks or going to their kangs at home to teach them every day.

    把大兴安岭变成文化岭
    林业职工掀起学习文化高潮
    据新华社牙克石16日电　内蒙古大兴安岭林业系统职工们，掀起了“千人教万人学”的向文化进军的高潮，要在国庆节以前基本扫除青壮年文盲，把大兴安岭变成“文化岭”，向国庆节献礼。
    目前，一万七千多名职工正分别在扫盲班、高小班、初中和高中班学习。其中在扫盲班学习的有一万多人，青壮年文盲已有95％入学。据初步统计，有两个局的五百多名过去的半文盲，在短期内积极学习，于最近获得了识字毕业证书，并升入了高小班学习。
    各学习班的学员们，除每周有六小时的集中上课以外，并本着识一个字就做一个字的先生、一个字不会就当一个字的学生的精神，组织了许多两人以上的“互教互学”小组；此外还有许多小型的包教包学小组，随时随地学习。
    西尼气职工子弟小学组织了儿童扫盲队，儿童们在要路口设了“文化岗”，来了工人叔叔叫住识字，对不认识的字立即教会。还有的学生和住宅周围的文盲订了公约，每天送字块或到家里炕头去教。
