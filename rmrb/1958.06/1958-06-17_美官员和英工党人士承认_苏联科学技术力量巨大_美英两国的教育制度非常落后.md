Xinhua News Agency, June 15th - According to TASS, Washington, June 14th: US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Wilcox, delivered a speech at the University of Iowa, and had to admit the enormous achievements of the Soviet Union in science and economics.

Wilcox said that the Soviet Union's launched artificial satellite "clearly demonstrates the Soviet Union's enormous potential in science and technology. This potential is also manifested in the military, in the manufacturing of long-range rockets, including intercontinental ballistic missiles."

Wilcox said that the Soviet Union currently has a strong scientific and technological strength, which is "largely a product of the Soviet education system," and this system poses a "challenge" to the American education system.

When talking about the situation of Soviet university students learning foreign languages, Wilcox said: "The Soviet Union has ten million students learning English, which is an astonishing number. However, half of our high schools do not teach any foreign languages at all. I cite these unpleasant facts to illustrate that the Soviet education system is a tremendous force that cannot be ignored."

Wilcox said: "It is clear that a fundamental change in Americans' attitude towards academics and knowledge is absolutely necessary." He said that people engaged in science have never received the proper status in American social life. In the United States, the spirit of being studious and inquisitive is even often equated with disloyalty or subversive activities.

Xinhua News Agency, June 16th - According to TASS, London, June 15th: Britain's per capita education spending is two-thirds less than the Soviet Union's. Due to insufficient funding, the construction of British schools is being scaled back, teaching staff is insufficient, and the entire education system lags behind the requirements of modern science and technology. These situations were mentioned by British Labour MP, Mr. Kim, in a speech.

The Labour Party's plan on education, published in London, also touched on similar situations. Britain is now implementing a so-called "child talent assessment" system, which unreasonably deprives many children of the working people of the opportunity to receive higher education. The plan said that Britain's situation in training technical experts is also unsatisfactory. Britain lags far behind the Soviet Union in this regard, with the Soviet Union training four times more experts than Britain each year. The plan believes that one of the most important reasons for Britain's backwardness in educational development is insufficient funding: education funding currently only accounts for 3% of national income, the same as in 1938. Another major obstacle to developing education is the shortage of teachers.

### 美官员和英工党人士承认  苏联科学技术力量巨大  美英两国的教育制度非常落后

    美官员和英工党人士承认
    苏联科学技术力量巨大
    美英两国的教育制度非常落后
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿14日讯：美国助理国务卿维尔科克斯在衣阿华州大学发表了一篇演说，不得不承认苏联科学和经济的巨大成就。
    维尔科克斯说，苏联发射的人造卫星“清楚地表明苏联在科学和技术上的巨大潜力。这种潜力也同样表现在军事上，表现在远程火箭，包括洲际弹道火箭的制造方面。”
    维尔科克斯说，目前苏联在科学和技术上实力雄厚，这“在很大程度上是苏联教育制度的产物”，这种制度对美国教育制度提出了“挑战”。
    维尔科克斯在谈到苏联大学生学习外国语方面的情况时说：“苏联有一千万学生在学习英语，这是一个惊人的数目。然而，我们有半数中学根本不教授任何外国语。我列举这些不愉快的事实是为了说明，苏联的教育制度是不可等闲视之的巨大力量。”
    维尔科克斯说：“很明显，完全需要从根本上改变美国人对学术和知识的态度。”他说，从事科学的人在美国社会生活中从来得不到应有的地位。在美国好学爱问的精神甚至往往被视为同不忠诚或颠复活动等同的东西。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社伦敦15日讯：英国按人口平均的教育开支比苏联少三分之二。由于经费不足，英国学校的建设正在缩减，教学人员不足，整个教育制度落后于现代科学技术水平的要求。这些情况是英国工党议员金在一次发言中提到的。
    工党在伦敦公布的有关教育方面的计划也谈到类似情况。英国现在正推行所谓“检查儿童才智”的制度，这项制度使英国许多劳动人民的子弟不合理地被剥夺了受高等教育的机会。计划说，英国在培养技术专家方面的情况也是不能令人满意的。英国在这方面远远落后于苏联，苏联每年培养出的专家比英国多四倍。计划认为，英国在教育发展方面落后的最重要原因之一是经费不足：现在教育经费仅占国民收入的3％，同1938年的经费一样。另一个发展教育事业的重大障碍是教师不足。
