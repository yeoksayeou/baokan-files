Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 23rd: Du Benzheng, a young mechanical engineer at the Hohhot City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, recently successfully modified the line finder of an automatic telephone exchange. This eliminated the serious obstacle of a single machine failure causing the entire line finder to fail to start, and also greatly shortened the time for troubleshooting.

The serious obstacle of a single machine failure causing the entire line finder to fail to start has been a problem that Chinese postal and telecommunications technicians have been unable to solve for a long time. After the leaders of the Hohhot City Postal and Telecommunications Bureau issued a call to eliminate this obstacle last November, Du Benzheng, a 24-year-old Communist Party member and mechanical engineer, began to study diligently, repeatedly drawing diagrams and experimenting. This line finder, which was successfully modified with the help of veteran workers, not only eliminated the above-mentioned serious obstacle, but also shortened the time for discovering and locating obstacles from the past 40 to 50 seconds to about one second, greatly improving call efficiency.

    消除电话故障方便了
    都本正改装自动电话交换机寻线机
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电  呼和浩特市邮电局青年机务员都本正最近改装成功自动电话交换机的寻线机，消灭了因一部机器发生故障而造成全台寻线机不能起动的严重障碍，并且大大缩短了消除故障的时间。
    一部机器发生故障而造成全台寻线机不能起动的严重障碍，是我国邮电技术人员长期以来没有解决的问题。去年11月呼和浩特市邮电局领导人员提出消灭这种障碍的号召以后，共产党员、二十四岁的机务员都本正便开始苦心钻研，反复绘图试验。在老工人帮助下改制成功的这架寻线机，不但消除了上述严重障碍，并且在发现和寻找障碍的时间上，也由过去的四、五十秒钟缩短到一秒钟左右，大大提高了通话效率。
