    The Pearl of Russian Ballet Shines on the Chinese Stage
    ——Before the Performance of "Swan Lake" at the Beijing Dance School
    Soviet Expert, Honored Artist　Bi·An·Guxiefu
    The ballet "Swan Lake," performed by teachers and students of the Beijing Dance School, is a bold attempt.
    In the history of ballet, no dance school has ever performed the entire ballet "Swan Lake." This ballet by Tchaikovsky is recognized as the pinnacle of European classical ballet. It is the foundation of the repertoire of ballet theaters in various countries around the world. The success of a "Swan Lake" performance is a measure of whether a troupe is mature.
    Precisely for this reason, the leadership of the Beijing Dance School proposed to all teachers and students to rehearse this ballet in order to lay the foundation for establishing the first ballet theater in China in the future.
    The rehearsal of this ballet began on February 20th of this year, and it reached the performance level after only four short months. The two fifth-grade female students, both eighteen years old, who play the lead roles of Odette and Odile, and the young ballet teacher who plays the prince are also recent graduates of the dance school. Chinese choreographers Li Chengxiang, Li Chengliang, Zhang Xu, and Wu Fukang actively participated in the rehearsal. Students from the training class attached to the dance school also participated in the rehearsal as interns.
    The ballet "Swan Lake" was first performed at the Bolshoi Theater in 1877. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote it at the request of German ballet choreographer Reisinger. According to contemporary reviews, the performance of this ballet was unsuccessful because Reisinger was a very poor choreographer.
    Progressive cultural figures in Russia supported Tchaikovsky, viewing his first ballet as a work of fundamental significance to music and dance.
    The libretto was co-authored by ballet dancer Geltzer and theater director Bekichev. It is clearly based on the myth "Swan Lake" written by the German writer Musäus (1735-1787). However, Musäus's myth lacks the basic dramatic conflict - the contradiction between the swan maiden, the prince, and the evil sorcerer in the form of an evil bird. Tchaikovsky, however, reveals one of the central themes: the yearning for sincere happiness and love in the struggle of desperate souls, thereby affirming the theme of the whole play: the power of love surpasses death.
    Tchaikovsky began the struggle for those dramatic principles that would later become the tradition of Russian ballet with "Swan Lake." The failure of the first performance in 1877 saddened Tchaikovsky greatly. Later, this ballet was rarely performed, and the audience did not welcome it. In 1880, ballet choreographer Gorsky tried to make some revisions, but failed again in 1884. Since then, the ballet "Swan Lake" has not been performed.
    However, people did not forget the musical score of this ballet. Ballet theaters also slowly approached Tchaikovsky. Ten years later, his ballets "Sleeping Beauty" and "The Nutcracker" achieved great success, and his creations became the pride of Russian musical culture.
    At a memorial evening for Tchaikovsky, the second act of "Swan Lake," choreographed by Lev Ivanov, was performed and achieved great success. (This act still uses Ivanov's choreography.) Therefore, people wanted to restore the entire ballet; this ideal was realized in St. Petersburg in 1895, and the choreographers were Lev Ivanov and Marius Petipa.
    The libretto underwent major revisions, and therefore the music was also arranged and adapted by Drigo (composer and conductor). This revised score was used until 1952.
    The new choreography of "Swan Lake" was realized in the Soviet ballet world under the initiative of the Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre. This revision was due to the following reasons.
    The great Russian ballet music reformer Tchaikovsky was not understood by his contemporaries at the time, and on the stage of Soviet ballet, this founder of realistic ballet music, a fighter for ideologically sound and rich ballet and ideologically emotional dance, should be allowed to sound loudly. "Swan Lake" became a moving script that promoted moral ideals and a paean to the victory of love over death. The Moscow Music Theatre strived to reveal Tchaikovsky's intentions and realize the composer's own ideals as much as possible. To this end, it was necessary to listen to and carefully study the composer's first manuscript. This was not done to blindly follow it. Due to the initial choreographer Reisinger, there were also some errors in Tchaikovsky's score. In order to understand Tchaikovsky's intentions and his unique musical and dramatic structure, it was only possible to follow his structure, because Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" is very rich in content, and the music is full of imagery everywhere.
    The Music Theatre strived to reveal the ideological content of the music of this storyteller's moral ideals, a person who is infinitely loyal to vows and love, a strong and unyielding person who believes that the power of love and truth overcomes death. The choreographers strived to make the dance in this play full of content, which is exactly what Tchaikovsky demanded. Tchaikovsky added dramatic content to each piece, despite the poor quality of the ballet's libretto.
    In the new performance of "Swan Lake," the theatre tried as much as possible to eliminate anything that was incompatible with Tchaikovsky's spirit and imposed on him, so that everyone participating in the performance could truly live and act on the stage, in order to help realistically display the ideas of the work. The new performance achieved great success. At present, "Swan Lake" is increasingly being handled on the stages of various theatres in the Soviet Union, basically according to the new performance method of the Music Theatre.
    It is correct for the leadership of the Beijing Dance School to take this performance method as the basis for the performance. Of course, not all the plots of this play can be handled by the students of the dance school. In any case, this pearl of Russian ballet, namely "Swan Lake," which requires profound dance techniques and performing skills, and a complex and unique performance style, will appear in Beijing. The audience in Beijing will be eagerly awaiting the premiere of this ballet.
    We wish the Beijing Dance School success in this bold initiative and continue to rehearse other classical ballets, organize the first ballet theater in China, and even establish a Chinese Dance Research Institute.

    俄国芭蕾舞剧的明珠闪耀在中国舞台上
    ——写在北京舞蹈学校上演“天鹅湖”之前
    苏联专家、功勋演员　彼·安·古谢夫
    北京舞蹈学校由教员和学生演出的芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”，是一个大胆的尝试。
    在芭蕾舞历史上，从来没有一所舞蹈学校演出过整个舞剧“天鹅湖”。柴可夫斯基的这个舞剧被公认为是欧洲古典芭蕾舞剧的顶峰。它是世界各国芭蕾舞剧院上演剧目的基础，“天鹅湖”演出的好坏是衡量一个剧团是否成熟的标志。
    正因为如此，北京舞蹈学校的领导上在全校师生面前提出了排演这部舞剧，为今后在中国建立第一所芭蕾舞剧院打下基础。
    这部舞剧是在今年2月20日开始排演的，经过四个多月短促时间就达到了演出水平。扮演“天鹅湖”主角奥杰塔、奥奇利雅的是两位十八岁的五年级女学生，扮演王子的是年青的芭蕾舞教员，他们也是刚刚从舞蹈学校毕业的。中国的编导李承祥、栗承廉、张旭和邬福康积极参加了排演工作。舞蹈学校附设的导训班同学也作为实习演员参加排演。
    “天鹅湖”这部舞剧第一次是1877年在大剧院上演的。当时柴可夫斯基是应德国芭蕾舞编导列伊金格尔之请而写作的。据当时的评论说，因为列伊金格尔是个很蹩脚的编导，所以这个芭蕾舞剧的演出没有成功。
    俄国的进步文化人士支持了柴可夫斯基，把他的第一个芭蕾舞剧看成是对音乐和舞蹈具有原则性意义的作品。
    这一个台本是芭蕾舞演员格里采尔和剧院指导别基切夫合编的。它显然是取材于德国作家穆泽乌斯
  （1735——1787）写的神话“天鹅池”。然而，在穆泽乌斯的神话中缺乏基本的戏剧性冲突——天鹅姑娘、王子和以恶鸟的形象出现的魔王之间的矛盾。而柴可夫斯基却揭示出中心的主题之一：在绝望的心灵的斗争中渴求真诚的幸福和爱情，从而肯定了全剧的主题：爱情的力量胜过死神。
    柴可夫斯基通过“天鹅湖”开始了争取以后成为俄国舞剧的传统的那些戏剧性原则的斗争。1877年初次演出的失败使柴可夫斯基感到很伤心。以后这部舞剧很少上演，观众也不欢迎它。1880年芭蕾舞剧编导冈津曾经想作些修改，但是在1884年又遭到失败。从此舞剧“天鹅湖”就不再上演了。
    然而，人们并没有忘掉这部舞剧的音乐总谱。芭蕾舞剧院也慢慢和柴可夫斯基接近起来。十年以后，他的舞剧“睡美人”和“胡桃夹子”获得了很大成功，他的创作也成了俄国音乐文化的骄傲。
    在一次悼念柴可夫斯基的晚会上，演出了里夫·伊凡诺夫编导的“天鹅湖”的第二幕，获得了极大的成功。（这一幕至今还是采用伊凡诺夫的排演方法）。因此，人们就想恢复整个舞剧；1895年在彼得堡实现了这一理想，担任该剧编导的是里夫·伊凡诺夫和马里乌斯·彼季帕。
    台本经过了很大的修改，因此，音乐也由德里戈（作曲家兼乐队指挥）作了整理和改编。这个改编的总谱一直沿用到1952年。
    “天鹅湖”的新台本编排是在莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦柯音乐剧院的倡导下，在苏维埃的芭蕾舞界实现的。这一修改，是有下列原因的。
    伟大的俄国舞剧音乐改革家柴可夫斯基在当时没有为同代人所理解，而在苏联芭蕾舞的舞台上应该让这位现实主义舞剧音乐的奠基人，为争取有思想性和丰富内容的芭蕾舞和富有思想情感的舞蹈而奋斗的战士发出响亮的声音。“天鹅湖”成了一个激动人心的宣扬道德理想的剧本和爱情战胜死神的凯歌。莫斯科音乐剧院力求揭示柴可夫斯基的意图，尽可能实现作曲家本人的理想。为此必须倾听和仔细研究作曲家的第一次手稿本。这样做并不是为了盲目地遵循它。由于最初的编导列伊金格尔的缘故，柴可夫斯基的乐谱中也有一些错误的地方。为了理解柴可夫斯基的意图以及他独特的音乐戏剧结构，只能遵循他的结构，因为柴可夫斯基的“天鹅湖”内容十分丰富，而且音乐处处富有形象性。
    音乐剧院力求揭示出这个叙述人的道德理想的音乐的思想内容，这个人无限忠诚于誓言和爱情，他是一个坚强不屈的人，在他看来，爱情和真理的力量胜过死亡。编导者努力使本剧的舞蹈富有充实的内容，这正是柴可夫斯基所要求的。柴可夫斯基在每个曲目中都加进了戏剧性的内容，尽管舞剧的台本很贫乏。
    在“天鹅湖”的新演法中剧院尽可能地消除同柴可夫斯基精神格格不入的强加给他的一些东西，使得一切参加演出的人都能真实地在舞台上生活和行动，以便有助于现实主义地展示作品的思想。新的演法获得了巨大的成功。目前，在苏联各家剧院的舞台上“天鹅湖”越来越多地基本上按音乐剧院的新演法来处理了。
    北京舞蹈学校的领导上采取这种演法作为演出的基础，是正确的。当然，并非这个剧的一切情节，都是舞蹈学校学员所能胜任的。但不论怎样说，俄国芭蕾舞剧的这颗明珠，即要求艰深舞蹈技术和表演技巧、同复杂而又特殊的演法表演的“天鹅湖”将出现在北京。北京的观众将怀着兴奋的心情等待着这部舞剧的公演。
    我们预祝北京舞蹈学校在这次大胆的创举中取得成绩，并且继续排演其他古典芭蕾舞剧，组织中国第一所芭蕾舞剧院，以至成立中国舞蹈研究院。
