    "Wang Baojing Style" Thought Formula
    Min Yi

    When people contemplate any issue, they can employ two different thought formulas. One is: "Cannot be done – won't do it – cannot be accomplished." The other is: "Can be done – do it immediately – can be accomplished." In the eyes of the former, things that predecessors couldn't do cannot be done, and therefore they don't even want to try, and ultimately, of course, it cannot be accomplished. This is the thought formula of the retreatist faction. In the eyes of the latter, anything can be accomplished, they actively pursue it, and as a result, they succeed. This is a thought formula with a communist style.

    Wang Baojing, the director of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Shaanxi Province, is a typical representative of the latter thought formula.

    In Wang Baojing's eyes, nothing is impossible. Why couldn't one mu of land grow one crop of wheat and one crop of cotton in a year in the past? What were the difficulties? After he experimented, he found the reasons, overcame the difficulties, and two crops a year were accomplished. In Wang Baojing's mind, there is not a trace of superstition. Things are all done by people, so why can university professors do it, but farmers cannot? Sure enough, some things that ordinary people didn't dare to think about were accomplished in his hands!

    Our peasants are diligent and brave peasants, and once their minds are liberated, they will create miracles that even university professors and experts cannot create!

    “王保京式”的思想公式
    敏宜
    人们在思考任何问题时，可以有两种不同的思想公式。一种是：“不能办——不去办——办不到。”另一种是：“能够办——马上办——办得到。”在前一种人的眼里，前人办不到的事情就不能办，因而也就不想去办，最后当然办不到。这是促退派的思想公式。在后一种人眼里，任何事情是能够办到的，他们积极去办，结果办成功了。这是具有共产主义风格的思想公式。
    陕西省烽火农业社主任王保京，是后一种思想公式的典型代表。
    在王保京的眼里，没有什么是办不到的。一块地里，一年种一料麦子一料棉花，过去为什么办不到？有什么困难？经他一试验，找出了原因，困难克服了，一年两熟就办到了。在王保京的思想里，没有半点儿迷信成分。事情都是人作的，为什么大学教授能作，农民就不能作？果然，一些原是普通人不敢想的事，在他手里作出来了！
    我们的农民是勤劳勇敢的农民，他们的思想一经解放，便会创造出连大学教授、专家们也无法创造的奇迹！
