Starting from Scratch, Opening the Door to Production
    Shenyang Building Materials Industry School Actively Carries Out Work-Study Programs

    (Our dispatch) Reporter Lin Mo reports: In carrying out work-study programs, Shenyang Building Materials Industry School has made use of whatever was available, starting from scratch, gradually creating conditions, and vigorously developing production, opening up a path for realizing the combination of education and production, theory and practice, intellectuals and workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor.

    The school's work-study program has been carried out under the political command of the leadership, with the Two-Anti Campaign as the key, and in the continuous struggle against the erroneous view that teaching and production are opposed, various conservative ideas, extravagance and waste, and purely economic viewpoints. The school has a total of more than 1,100 people, and the production equipment in the school is relatively poor. Originally, there was only one internship factory including twenty-three lathes. When the work-study program was first proposed, some people thought that the school had little production equipment, and the proportion of theoretical and basic knowledge courses was large, so it was impossible to engage in production on a large scale like some industrial technical schools. On the one hand, the school leadership criticized the erroneous view that teaching and production were opposed, and on the other hand, it mobilized teachers and students to find ways to produce.

    Teachers and students went out in all directions, almost running all over the city's factories, mines, enterprises and relevant units, and brought back a batch of work. However, after research by the technicians of the internship factory and relevant professional teachers, it was believed that nothing could be done. They believed that the technical level of the students was too low and the production equipment was insufficient, so doing this work would only lose money. Is the students' technology really completely useless? In order to change the conservative ideas of these people, the leadership selected several students with different technical levels to test on the lathe. The results proved that as long as there is correct guidance and help from experienced masters, the technical ability of students can quickly meet the requirements. Subsequent practice has more fully proved this point.

    When the Two-Anti movement reached its climax, the leadership organized all teachers and students to work hard for three days and three nights. The power of the masses broke through the gate of conservative thought. After three days of hard work, the factory officially started operation; the long-running trial production of glass wool and low-grade cinder cement was also successfully completed. Two hundred and forty students went to the brick factory to participate in labor, forty students drew blueprints for construction units, and one hundred and seventy students went to the school's mechanical factory. Some teachers and students participated in agricultural labor around the school. The school leadership further made a comprehensive plan and arrangement for the school's production. The principle of the arrangement is: starting from the viewpoint of development, try to combine production with teaching as much as possible. They have signed a contract with relevant departments to produce 30,000 tons of low-grade cement, and the school is using the original incomplete parts to independently design and install a cement mill.

    白手起家　打开生产之门
    沈阳建筑材料工业学校积极开展勤工俭学活动
    本报讯　记者林沫报道：沈阳建筑材料工业学校在开展勤工俭学活动中，因陋就简，白手起家，逐步创造条件，大力发展生产，为实现教育结合生产、理论结合实际、知识分子结合工农、脑力劳动结合体力劳动开辟了道路。
    该校的勤工俭学活动是在领导上实行了政治挂帅，以双反为纲，在不断同教学与生产相对立的错误观点、各种保守思想、铺张浪费和单纯经济观点等进行斗争中开展起来的。该校共有一千一百多人，校内生产设备较差，原只有一个包括二十三部车床的实习工厂。初提出勤工俭学的时候，有些人就认为学校生产设备少，理论和基础知识课占的比重大，不可能像某些工业技术学校那样大搞生产。学校领导上一面批判这种教学和生产对立的错误观点，一面就发动师生寻找生产门路。
    师生四出活动，几乎跑遍了全市厂矿企业和有关单位，揽回一批活。但经实习工厂的技工同有关专业教师研究的结果，认为样样都不能作。他们认为同学的技术水平太低，生产设备不足，干这些活只会赔钱。同学的技术真的完全不行吗？领导上为改变这些人的保守思想，就挑选了几种不同技术水平的同学上车床试验。结果证明，只要有老师傅的正确指导和帮助，同学的技术能力是可以很快达到要求的。以后的实践更充分的证明了这一点。
    在双反运动达到高潮的时候，领导上组织全体师生苦战了三昼夜。群众的力量冲破了保守思想的闸门。经过三天苦干，工厂正式开工了；进行已久的玻璃棉和低标号煤碴水泥也同时试制成功了。有二百四十个同学到烧砖厂参加劳动，四十个同学给建筑单位描绘图纸，一百七十个同学到校内机械工厂，一部分师生在学校周围参加农业劳动。学校领导上进一步对全校的生产作了全面的规划和安排。安排的原则是：从发展观点着眼，尽量使生产同教学相结合。他们已经同有关部门签订了生产三万吨低标号水泥的合同，学校正在利用原有残缺部件，自行设计和装置水泥磨。
