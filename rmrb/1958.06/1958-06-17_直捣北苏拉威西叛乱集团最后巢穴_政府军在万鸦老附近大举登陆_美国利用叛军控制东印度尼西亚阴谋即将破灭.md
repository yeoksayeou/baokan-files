Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 16th: Indonesian naval authorities announced today that Indonesian government Marine Corps and Army troops launched a large-scale landing at Gema in North Sulawesi at 6:00 AM local time today. Gema is located on the east coast of the Minahasa region, east of the rebel stronghold of Manado.

It was announced that this landing is the largest amphibious landing to be conducted in order to finally eliminate the rebel group. Prior to this, government forces had already landed at Bitung Port and the coast north of Manado on June 9th and 13th respectively, and occupied important islands surrounding the Minahasa region. Minahasa is the center of the area seized by the North Sulawesi rebel group.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 16th: This reporter reports: The news of the large-scale landing by Indonesian government forces near Manado shows that the conspiracy of the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) to use the Sulawesi rebels to control the East Indonesian region will burst like a soap bubble.

Antara News Agency revealed that the first step in the US and rebel plan to occupy East Indonesia was to defeat the government forces in the Maluku-West Irian defense area and control this region. Therefore, they first occupied Morotai and Jailolo north of Maluku, preparing to attack Ambon in southern Maluku, and then launch from Ambon to occupy Timor. The rebels also planned to capture Tarakan Island, which is rich in oil, and Balikpapan in East Kalimantan. Former Air Force Major Muharto, one of the rebel leaders, once guaranteed that the US and SEATO air forces would cover the aforementioned rebel operations. He also said that Chiang Kai-shek's troops and SEATO troops would become the source of troops for the rebels when they take the next step in seizing East Indonesia.

Indonesian newspapers have repeatedly pointed out that the North Sulawesi rebels regard the realization of the US conspiracy to drag Indonesia, and first East Indonesia, into the scope of SEATO as their primary task.

The bold military operations launched by the North Sulawesi rebels also prove that they are supported by the United States and SEATO. The North Sulawesi rebels once sent an "expeditionary force" to occupy Morotai and Jailolo, and also sent a group of soldiers to Parigi in eastern Central Sulawesi. The rebel troops sent out were far away from the rebel base; maritime traffic between them could not be guaranteed without air cover. Lieutenant Colonel Piet, commander of the Maluku-West Irian defense area, said some time ago when he landed in Jailolo that the rebels were covered by Dutch warships. There are some reports that when the rebels landed on Morotai, they were also covered by foreign warships. At that time, American planes coordinated with the rebels' military operations and carried out a series of inhuman bombings in East Indonesia.

Thanks to the resolute actions of the Indonesian people and government forces, the Indonesian government forces have now not only recovered all the areas in the Maluku region previously occupied by the rebels, but also landed near Manado, the last nest of the rebels. The conspiracy of the United States and SEATO to control East Indonesia will fail, whether they like it or not.

    直捣北苏拉威西叛乱集团最后巢穴
    政府军在万鸦老附近大举登陆
    美国利用叛军控制东印度尼西亚阴谋即将破灭
    据新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚海军当局今天宣布，印度尼西亚政府军的海军陆战队和陆军部队今天上午当地时间六时在北苏拉威西的格马大规模登陆。格马在叛乱集团巢穴万鸦老以东米那哈沙地区的东海岸。
    据宣布，这次登陆是为了最后消灭叛乱集团而进行的最大规模的一次两栖登陆。在这以前，政府军在这地区已经分别在6月9日和13日在比东港和万鸦老北面的海岸登陆，并且占领了米那哈沙地区周围的重要岛屿。米那哈沙是北苏拉威西叛乱集团窃据地区的中心。
    据新华社雅加达16日电　本社记者报道：印度尼西亚政府军在万鸦老附近大规模登陆的消息表明，美国和东南亚条约组织利用苏拉威西的叛乱分子控制东印度尼西亚地区的阴谋将像肥皂泡一样破灭。
    安塔拉通讯社揭露，美国和叛乱分子占据东印度尼西亚的计划的第一步是击破在马鲁古—西伊里安防区的政府军并且控制这个地区。因此，他们首先占据了马鲁古北面的摩罗泰和济罗罗，准备进攻马鲁古南面的安汶，然后从安汶出动占领帝汶。叛乱分子还策划攻占盛产石油的打拉根岛和东加里曼丹的巴厘巴板。前空军少校、叛乱分子首脑之一穆哈托曾经保证说，美国和东南亚条约组织的空军将掩护上述叛乱分子的作战。他又说，蒋介石的军队和东南亚条约组织的部队在叛乱分子采取攫取东印度尼西亚的下一个步骤的时候将成为叛乱分子的兵源。
    印度尼西亚报纸一再指出，北苏拉威西的叛乱分子把实现美国将印度尼西亚，首先将东印度尼西亚拖入东南亚条约组织范围的阴谋当作他们的首要任务。
    北苏拉威西叛乱分子发动的大胆的军事行动也证明他们是得到美国和东南亚条约组织的支持的。北苏拉威西叛乱分子曾经派遣“远征军”占领摩罗泰和济罗罗，此外还派遣一批士兵到中苏拉威西东部的巴里吉去。派遣出去的叛军部队都是远离叛乱分子基地的；他们之间的海路交通如果没有空军的保护是不能保证的。马鲁古—西伊里安防区司令皮埃特斯中校前些时候在济罗罗登陆时说，叛乱分子是得到荷兰军舰的掩护的。有一些消息说，当叛乱分子在摩罗泰登陆时，他们也得到外国军舰的掩护。那时美国飞机配合叛乱分子的军事行动，在东印度尼西亚进行一系列的残无人性的轰炸。
    由于印度尼西亚人民和政府军的坚决行动，印度尼西亚政府军现在已经不仅收复了马鲁古地区以前被叛乱分子占领的全部地方，而且也在叛乱分子的最后巢穴万鸦老附近登陆。美国和东南亚条约组织企图控制东印度尼西亚的阴谋将告失败，不论他们愿意不愿意到此为止。
