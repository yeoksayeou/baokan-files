    Notes
    "Santa Claus"
    The American magazine "The Nation" recently, in reporting on American financial and political "support" for South Vietnam, praised it as "one of the biggest Santa Claus operations ever."
    Indeed, in the past few years, the "gifts" that the United States has sent to South Vietnam cannot be considered few – with "aid" totaling more than ten billion dollars. The United States bears all the expenses of the South Vietnamese army and about 80% of all other government expenditures. In addition, the United States has sent thousands of "advisors" to South Vietnam.
    But what results have these American "gifts" caused in South Vietnam? "The Nation" also admits that anti-American sentiment is growing among the South Vietnamese people. For example, the American library was bombed in 1955; the ambassador's residence was bombed in 1956, and a hotel and an American library were bombed again in 1957...
    "The Nation" does not explain this phenomenon. But the South Vietnamese people know very well that America's "gifts" are great disasters. The United States uses military, political and economic means to divide Vietnam for a long time, puts South Vietnam under its control, implements colonial enslavement, and makes the lives of the South Vietnamese people more and more painful. The so-called "Santa Claus" is just a jackal in beautiful clothes!

    "Scapegoat"
    Johnston, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, is equally disturbed by the anti-American sentiment of the South Vietnamese people. In a public report, he admitted that throughout South Vietnam, "American jeeps, American uniforms, and American faces" are "disproportionately overabundant."
    However, this American business leader has a different view on the fundamental reason why the anti-American wave in South Vietnam is rising due to the United States turning South Vietnam into a colony.
    He said: "We (the United States) will inevitably become scapegoats, held responsible for dereliction of duty or shortcomings in which we have almost no part or no part at all."
    That's strange. The "American presence" in South Vietnam is ubiquitous, and it is still forced to say "almost no part or no part at all," which can only be the tone of a colonialist. Therefore, saying that the United States is a "scapegoat" is just as fabricated as saying "Santa Claus".

    札记
    “圣诞老人”
    美国“民族”周刊最近在报道美国对南越的财政和政治“支持”时，把它誉为“有史以来最大的圣诞老人的行动之一”。
    的确，在过去的几年中，美国送给南越的“礼物”不能算少——“援助”共达十亿多美元。美国承担了南越军队的全部费用和所有其他政府开支的80％左右。此外，美国还向南越派出了数以千计的“顾问”。
    但是，美国的这些“礼物”在南越引起什么结果呢？“民族”周刊也承认南越人民的反美情绪正在增长。例如，美国图书馆在1955年被炸；大使的寓所在1956年被炸，一家旅馆和美国图书馆在1957年又被炸……。
    “民族”周刊没有解释这种现象。可是南越人民是知道得很清楚的，美国的“礼物”就是大灾大难。美国利用军事、政治和经济的种种手段，长期分裂越南，把南越放在它的控制之下，实行殖民奴役，使南越人民的生活越来越痛苦了。所谓“圣诞老人”不过是一只披着漂亮衣裳的豺狼！
    “替罪羊”
    美国商会主席约翰斯顿，也同样对南越人民的反美情绪感到不安。他在一份公开报告中承认：在南越各地，“美国吉普车、美国军服和美国的面孔”“是不相称地过多了”。
    不过，对于美国把南越变成殖民地因而南越的反美浪潮日益高涨这一根本原因，这位美国商界头子却持另一种观点。
    他说：“我们（美国）将不可避免地成为替罪羊，而我们对之几乎没有份或完全没有份的失职或缺点负责”。
    这就奇怪了。在南越的“美国存在”无处不在，还要强说“几乎没有份或完全没有份”，这只能是殖民主义者的口吻。所以，说美国是“替罪羊”，也同说“圣诞老人”一样，完全是捏造。
