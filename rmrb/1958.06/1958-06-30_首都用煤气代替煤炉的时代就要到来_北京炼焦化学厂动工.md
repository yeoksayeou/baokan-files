Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The era of comprehensive coal utilization in the capital, replacing coal stoves with gas, is approaching. The Beijing Coking Chemical Plant, marking this giant leap forward, has recently begun construction and will start supplying gas by National Day next year.

Using coal stoves for cooking only utilizes one-fifth to one-half of the coal's energy. However, the coal smoke, containing dozens of chemical raw materials, is entirely wasted. Moreover, harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and sulfur monoxide in the coal smoke are arbitrarily diffused into the air, affecting the health of citizens and the cleanliness of the city.

After the Coking Chemical Plant under construction is put into production, it will begin to rationally and comprehensively utilize coal in the capital. The plant will build a workshop with 240 coke ovens. These coke ovens will use one million tons of raw coal annually, producing 400 million cubic meters of gas annually, which can meet the living needs of 800,000 to 1 million people, and can also meet the production needs of more than 30 factories. The 700,000 tons of coke left over after one million tons of raw coal generate gas can be used as fuel for nitrogen fertilizer plants, thermal power plants, and residents. In the gas production process, many industrial raw materials can also be recovered: benzene for manufacturing plastics, artificial fibers, solvent oils, etc.; ammonium sulfate for fertilizer; phenols for manufacturing disinfectants and plastics; asphalt for manufacturing preservatives and road construction, etc. Among them, the recovery of benzene alone, 6,000 tons, can produce the same weight of capron, which can replace the raw cotton needed to weave two million bolts of cotton cloth.

### 首都用煤气代替煤炉的时代就要到来  北京炼焦化学厂动工

    首都用煤气代替煤炉的时代就要到来
    北京炼焦化学厂动工
    新华社28日讯　首都综合利用煤炭，以煤气代替煤炉的时代就要到来，标志着这一巨大跃进的北京炼焦化学厂最近开工兴建，它将在明年国庆节开始供应煤气。
    使用煤炉生火作饭，只能利用煤的能量的五分之一到二分之一，而包含着几十种化学原料的煤烟，却全部浪费掉，而且煤烟中的一氧化碳、一氧化硫等有害气体在空气中任意扩散，影响市民身体健康和城市清洁。
    兴建中的炼焦化学厂投入生产以后，就将开始在首都合理地综合利用燃煤。这座厂将兴建拥有二百四十个炼焦炉的车间。这些炼焦炉每年使用原煤一百万吨，年产四亿立方公尺的煤气，可满足八十万到一百万人口生活上的需要，还可以满足三十多个工厂生产上的需要。一百万吨原煤发生煤气以后留下来的七十万吨煤焦，可以供氮肥厂、热电厂和居民作燃料。在煤气生产过程中，还可以回收许多工业原料：制造塑料、人造纤维、溶剂油等的苯类，作肥料用的硫铵，制造消毒剂和塑料的酚类，制造防腐剂和筑路用的沥青等。其中光是苯类一项，回收六千吨就能制造同等重量的卡普龙，可以代替纺织二百万匹棉布所需要的原棉。
