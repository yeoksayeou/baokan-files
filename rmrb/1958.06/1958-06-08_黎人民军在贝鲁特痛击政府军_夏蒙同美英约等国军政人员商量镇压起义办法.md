Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th – According to a broadcast from the “Voice of Free Lebanon” radio station, Lebanese government troops in Beirut attempted on the 6th, under the cover of tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery, to break into areas controlled by the People's Army, but were defeated by the resolute resistance of the People's Army.

The radio station said that three government tanks were destroyed, and one was set on fire.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Lebanese Prime Minister Solh, in his dual capacity as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, ordered the bombing of areas in Beirut controlled by the insurgent people on the 6th, but this was rejected by the Army Headquarters. The “Voice of Free Lebanon” radio station said that government troops once again attempted to enter Tripoli on the 6th, but failed, with twelve government soldiers killed in the battle.

According to the "Al-Hayat" newspaper in Damascus, Lebanese President Chamoun and Prime Minister Solh held a four-hour meeting on the 6th with the ambassadors of the United States and Britain, Jordanian Royal Court Chief of Staff Talhouni, Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Majali, senior British military officers in the Middle East, and senior officers of the US Sixth Fleet, to discuss how to suppress the Lebanese uprising.

According to the "Sawt al-Arab" newspaper, Sabri Hamadeh, a leader of the Lebanese opposition party, held a press conference on the 6th in the village of Nabi Othman in the Hermel region, which was recently occupied by the People's Army, exposing the fact that the United States is supplying weapons to the supporters of the National Socialist Party to massacre the Lebanese people. Hamadeh showed everyone the American weapons recently seized by the People's Army during the capture of Nabi Othman, and pointed out that these weapons are part of the weapons recently shipped by the United States to Lebanon.

According to the "Al-Hayat" newspaper on the 7th, an Iraqi officer who was sent to Lebanon to assist Chamoun in suppressing the uprising defected to the Lebanese People's Army for political asylum in Tripoli. The Iraqi officer said that he arrived in Beirut two days ago with some Iraqi and Jordanian troops via Israel.
