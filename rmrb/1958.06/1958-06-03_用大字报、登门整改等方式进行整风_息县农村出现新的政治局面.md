Using Big-Character Posters, Door-to-Door Rectification, and Other Methods to Carry Out Rectification Campaign
A New Political Situation Emerges in Rural Xixian County
(Our report) Xixian County, Henan Province, taking rectification as the key and production as the theme, launched a mass rectification movement of the Party and communes. In the movement, methods such as exhibitions, big-character posters, door-to-door rectification, and mutual visits between higher and lower levels and left and right sides were widely adopted, with great results. The entire county's vast rural areas have seen a new political situation where everyone feels happy.
The county's rectification began in late February. On February 23, the county party committee convened an expanded meeting attended by township party committee secretaries, conveyed the provincial and prefectural committee's instructions on carrying out an anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in rural areas, and conducted discussions. In early March, the county party committee convened a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader to mobilize the full-scale launch of the "Two-Anti" movement. Then, discussions were carried out at the township level. By organizing cadres to visit the "Two-Anti" exhibition of county-level directly affiliated organs and carrying out large-scale debates, the ideological problems of some cadres who believed that "organs have waste and conservatism, but rural areas do not," some who said "production is busy, there is no time for 'Two-Anti'," and others who were afraid of getting burned were resolved, and the necessity of the "Two-Anti" was clarified. In late March, the prefectural committee convened a frontline meeting in Baoxin Township, affirmed and summarized the county's experience, and further promoted the in-depth development of the movement. After such a series of ideological mobilizations, a mass upsurge of anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparing with the advanced, and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results was immediately launched throughout the county. From March 23 to April 11, the county's 293 communes posted a total of more than 1.8 million big-character posters, more than 170,000 cartoons, and more than 2.4 million opinions. More than 260,000 people participated in airing their views, accounting for more than 90% of adults.
In the movement, township and commune cadres generally felt that the method of using living people and living events to educate the masses in the exhibition was very effective. After returning, they all launched exhibitions one after another. Currently, a total of 362 exhibition halls have been established. The exhibition generally includes four parts: the superiority of cooperativization; problems in progress; new people and new things after rectification; and long-term plans. Among them, there are big-character posters, pictures, cartoons, and real objects, with comparisons between good people and good deeds and bad people and bad deeds. The content is rich and enlightening to everyone. The county organized more than 220,000 people to visit, and the masses generally reflected: "Seeing the achievements is really happy, seeing the waste is very distressed, and seeing the long-term plan fills the whole body with energy."
In this county's "Two-Anti" campaign, the form of big-character posters was also widely adopted. The masses are very enthusiastic about writing big-character posters. Those who can write write themselves, and those who can't write ask others to write. Teachers, students, rural intellectuals, and transferred cadres all acted as scribes for farmers to write big-character posters. In Yanzhai Commune, 150 households of commune members took out more than 600 land certificates and old contracts to write big-character posters. One commune member wrote on the land certificate: "Joining the commune should be wholehearted, handing over the land should be to the root." Problems that had not been discovered and resolved for a long time in the cooperative over the years were solved easily through big-character posters.
The characteristics of Xixian County's rectification movement are: airing views and rectifying simultaneously, airing views and rectifying on the spot, integrating airing views with rectification, and promoting each other, promoting the movement forward in waves, achieving thorough airing and rectification, and especially the method of door-to-door rectification is deeply praised by the masses. Among the county's more than 9,500 cadres above the level of production team leader, about 6,700 people conducted door-to-door rectification. Zhang Shaofang, director of the Women's Federation of Yanzhai Commune, was squeamish. At first, the masses were unwilling to give her opinions. She personally visited the masses' homes and repeatedly expressed her attitude. The masses gave her more than 20 opinions. The cadres' door-to-door rectification moved the masses very much. They said: "Only the cadres educated by Chairman Mao can do this."
In addition, for major issues of the commune, a meeting of commune member representatives was held for rectification, and opinions aired at the construction site were rectified at the construction site. Through the above methods, basically thorough airing and quick rectification were achieved.
In the midst of the great airing and great blooming, agricultural cooperatives also put forward many criticisms and suggestions to the township and county leaders and various departments directly under the county. For the opinions raised by the masses on waste and conservatism, the methods of combining the upper and lower levels and left and right sides of the county, township and commune, and going down and coming up were adopted to carry out large-scale rectification. In mid-March, 93 people from the county-level directly affiliated organs, including the county party committee, the county people's committee, the bank, the supply and marketing cooperative, and the hospital, led by leading comrades such as Li Zongjian, member of the county party committee, Jia Xueyi, director of the Commercial Bureau, and Lin Changhuan, chief of the Health Section, formed six groups respectively, brought their own production tools to the township and commune, participated in production on the one hand, and explained the rectification plan to the masses and sought their opinions on the other.
After the movement of anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparing with the advanced, and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, the face of the countryside has been renewed. All aspects of rural work have undergone a leap in development. All the original third-class communes in the county have leaped to become first-class or second-class communes. The original first-class and second-class communes have also made significant improvements. Of the 48 original third-class party branches in the county, after rectification, 31 were upgraded to first-class and 17 were upgraded to second-class; of the 55 original third-class youth league branches, they have also been improved to varying degrees. The ideology and work style of party members and cadres have also undergone great changes. Among the more than 15,000 commune and team cadres in the county, more than 2,200 people did not participate in production in the past, but now they have all participated in production. A new relationship is being established between people and between families. Mutual love, unity and harmony, and diligent production have become a common social atmosphere.
Because the principle of taking production as the theme has always been implemented in the process of rectifying the party and the communes, the labor attendance rate of the vast masses has increased from 80% before the movement to 100%. Labor efficiency has generally increased by more than two times. In water conservancy construction, the county has completed more than 110 million cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for 108% of the original plan. More than 500 million dan of manure has been accumulated, and a mass technological revolution and agricultural tool improvement movement has also emerged. The large number of tools invented, created, imitated, and improved by the masses generally increased efficiency by five times, and the highest increased by 30 times.

　　用大字报、登门整改等方式进行整风
    息县农村出现新的政治局面
    本报讯  河南省息县以整风为纲，以生产为主题，开展了群众性的整党整社运动。运动中普遍采用展览会、大字报、登门整改和上下左右互相参观等方法，收效很大，使全县广大农村出现了人人心情舒畅的政治局面。
    这个县的整风，从2月下旬开始。2月23日县委召开了有乡党委书记参加的扩大会议，传达了省、地委关于在农村开展反浪费反保守运动的指示，进行了讨论研究。3月初，县委就开全县生产队长以上干部的大会，动员全面开展双反运动。然后以乡为单位开展了讨论。用组织干部参观县直属机关双反展览会和开展大辩论的办法，解决了有的干部认为“机关有浪费保守，农村没有”，有的说“生产忙，没有时间搞双反”，还有的怕引火烧身等思想问题，明确了双反的必要性。3月下旬，地委在包信乡召开了战地会议，肯定和总结了县的经验，进一步促进了运动的深入发展。经过这样一系列的思想发动，随即在全县范围内掀起了一个群众性的反浪费，反保守，比先进，比多、快、好、省的大整大改高潮。全县二百九十三个社，从3月23日到4月11日，共贴出大字报一百八十多万张，漫画十七万多张，鸣放意见二百四十多万条，参加鸣放的群众有二十六万多人，占成年人的90％以上。
    在运动中，由于乡、社干部普遍感到展览会用活人活事教育群众的办法，效果很好。回去后都纷纷举办展览会，目前共已建立展览馆三百六十二个。展览会一般包括有：合作化的优越性；前进中的问题；整改后的新人新事和远景规划四部分。其中有大字报，有图片、漫画、实物，有好人好事和坏人坏事对比，内容丰富，对大家启发很大。全县共组织了二十二万多人进行了参观，群众普遍反映是：“看了成绩真高兴，看了浪费很心疼，看了远景规划浑身是劲。”
    这个县双反中，还普遍采用大字报的形式。群众写大字报的劲头很足，会写的自己写，不会写的请人写，教师、学生、农村知识分子和下放干部都当了农民写大字报的代笔人。阎寨社还有一百五十户社员拿出六百多张土地证和老契约写大字报，有一社员在土地证上写着：“入社要入心，交地要交根”。合作社几年来没有发现的问题和长时期没有解决的问题，经过大字报迎刃而解。
    息县整改运动的特点是：边鸣放，边整改，就地鸣放，就地整改，放中有改，改中有放，密切结合，相互推动，一波一波地促进运动前进，达到鸣深放透，改的快，特别是登门整改的方式深受群众赞扬。全县生产队长以上干部九千五百多人中登门整改的约有六千七百人左右。阎寨社妇联主任张少芳有娇气，开始群众不愿给她提意见，她便亲自到群众家登门访问，再三表示态度，群众给她提出意见二十多条。干部登门整改，群众很受感动，他们说：“只有毛主席教养的干部才能做到这条。”
    另外，有关社内集体的重大问题，召开社员代表会进行整改，工地放的意见就在工地改。经过上述方法，基本上达到了鸣深放透改的快。
    农业社在大鸣大放中，对乡县领导和县直各个部门也提出了许多批评和建议。对于群众所提出的浪费和保守等方面的意见，采取了县乡社上下左右互相结合和下去上来的办法，进行大整大改。县直机关3月中旬有县委、县人委、银行、供销社、医院等部门共九十三人，由县委委员李宗建、商业局长贾学义、卫生科长林长桓等负责同志带领，分别组成了六个组，自带生产工具到乡社，一面参加生产，一面向群众讲解整改方案，征求群众意见。
    经过反浪费、反保守和比先进、比多快好省运动，农村面貌为之一新。农村的各项工作都有了飞跃的发展。全县原有的三类社都跃进为一类社或二类社。原来的一、二类社也有显著的提高。全县原有三类党支部四十八个，经过整顿，提高为一类的三十一个，提高为二类的十七个；原有三类团支部五十五个，也都有了不同程度的提高。党员和干部的思想作风也有很大转变。全县社、队干部一万五千多人中，过去不参加生产的有二千二百多人，现在已全部参加生产了。人与人之间，家庭之间，正在建立着一种新的关系。相亲相爱、团结和睦、勤劳生产已成了普遍的社会风气。
    由于在整党整社过程中始终贯彻了以生产为主题的方针，广大群众的劳动出勤率由运动前的80％提高100％。劳动效率一般提高两倍以上。兴修水利，全县已完成土方一亿一千多万公方，占原计划108％。完成积肥五亿多担，一个群众性的技术改革和农具改良运动也已经出现。群众发明创造和仿造改良的大批工具，一般提高效率五倍，最高的提高三十倍。
