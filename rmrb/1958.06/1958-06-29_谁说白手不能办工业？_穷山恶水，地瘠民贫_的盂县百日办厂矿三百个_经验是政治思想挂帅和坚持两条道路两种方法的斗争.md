Title: Who Says Industry Can't Be Started From Scratch? The "Poor Mountains and Bad Waters, Barren Land and Impoverished People" of Yu County Establish 300 Factories and Mines in 100 Days.

(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 28th) In just over a hundred days, the people of Yu County, Shanxi Province, built 307 factories and mines, and on June 6th, they completed China's first county-run small railway. These factories and mines include sulfur factories, cement factories, fertilizer factories, iron and wood farm tool processing plants, agricultural and sideline product processing plants, as well as asbestos mines, copper mines, iron mines, manganese mines, phosphate mines, and crystal mines.

Yu County is a poor mountainous area. When people talk about Yu County, they use the phrase "poor mountains and bad waters, barren land and impoverished people" to describe it. In the past, the county's industrial base was very weak; even broken plows had to be sent elsewhere for repair. Therefore, when the county party committee proposed to vigorously develop industry, many people said: "We have no money, no people, and no technology. What kind of industry can we start?" Many cadres and masses simply did not believe that Yu County could start any industry. In response to these ideas, the county party committee convened three meetings attended by party branch secretaries of townships and factories and mines, and directors of agricultural cooperatives, to debate whether Yu County could develop industry, whether it should develop industry, and how to develop industry. During the debate, some people calculated the relationship between industry and agriculture: if industry were developed, the fertilizer and tools needed for this year's agricultural leap forward could be self-sufficient; otherwise, agriculture could not leap forward either. They realized that walking on one leg was not acceptable, and it was necessary to vigorously develop industry and promote both industry and agriculture. However, some people could not understand, saying that although developing industry was important, it could not be done from scratch! After the debate, Zhang Runhuai, the secretary of the Yu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, concluded: "We have no money and no technology, but we have one thing – boldness, drive, and we'll just start doing it, we can't wait!" The county party committee immediately transferred more than 40 cadres and established a comprehensive office for running industry. Each of the county's 31 townships and 339 agricultural cooperatives also assigned a secretary and director to manage industry. At the same time, the county party committee organized four work teams, carrying tools, to go deep into various districts to carry out propaganda, mobilize the masses to report on and investigate mines. Whenever a work team arrived in a village, they either held a mass meeting or conducted individual interviews, explaining the benefits and significance of mining and running factories, and teaching the masses how to identify ores. Through mass mineral exploration, more than 60 kinds of minerals, including asbestos, copper, iron, phosphorus, and coal, have been discovered. Most of these mines are now being mined.

After the masses were mobilized, all difficulties were easily solved. If there were no tools, they brought their own tools; if there were no raw materials, they tried using local materials as substitutes. The county was originally most worried about not having funds to develop industry, but once mobilized, the peasants took out their savings, and some units took out temporarily unused party dues, administrative medical expenses, and trade union dues. In a few days, the county raised more than 2.4 million yuan, solving the funding needs for industrial construction. There were also difficulties with labor, but the Yu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that the potential of rural labor was still very large, and manpower could be tapped as long as a solution was found. They experimented with factories and mines to find out how many people were needed for indigenous mining and factory operations, and how much work a laborer could do in a day. Afterwards, they helped agricultural cooperatives calculate the workload of the agricultural cooperatives, the male and female labor force of the agricultural cooperatives, the full labor force and the half labor force. After comprehensive planning, each agricultural cooperative could extract 8%, 10% to 16% of the people. The problem of labor for developing industry was also solved.

Learning from the masses, and then guiding the masses, not only enabled the leaders to provide production leadership and technical guidance to the numerous new factories and mines, but also enabled many difficult problems to be solved in a timely manner. Yu County is rich in asbestos, which the state currently needs very much, but the efficiency of mass mining is very low, and the mined ore cannot be processed. Some people are unwilling to mine. When the work team was anxiously at a loss, the county party committee instructed them to conduct pilot research on solutions at the Shitou Asbestos Mine, which produces a large amount of asbestos. After the work team discussed with the masses, the masses created a mining tool and improved the millstone used for grinding flour to process asbestos, greatly improving efficiency and boosting morale. Women who had never participated in labor in the past were also vying to grind asbestos.

Recently, Yu County further studied the issue of consolidating and improving the new factories and mines, and decided to establish seven comprehensive farm implement repair and assembly stations throughout the county, with the farm implement repair and assembly stations and existing large factories and mines as the center, responsible for technical guidance to the new factories and mines and helping to trial-produce new products that the new factories and mines could not manage. Now, many new factories and mines have established contact with large factories and mines.

### 谁说白手不能办工业？  “穷山恶水，地瘠民贫”的盂县百日办厂矿三百个  经验是政治思想挂帅和坚持两条道路两种方法的斗争

    谁说白手不能办工业？
    “穷山恶水，地瘠民贫”的盂县百日办厂矿三百个
    经验是政治思想挂帅和坚持两条道路两种方法的斗争
    本报太原28日电　山西省盂县人民在一百多天里，建成三百零七个厂矿，并且在6月6日建成了我国第一条县办小铁路。这些厂矿中有硫磺厂、水泥厂、肥料厂、铁木农具加工厂、农副土产加工厂和石棉矿、铜矿、铁矿、锰矿、磷矿、水晶矿等。
    盂县是个贫穷的山区，群众一谈起盂县，就用“穷山恶水，地瘠民贫”的话来形容它。过去，这个县的工业基础很薄弱，山地犁坏了都得到外地去修理。因此，当县委提出大办工业时，很多人说：一没钱，二没人，三没技术，办什么工业！不少干部和群众根本不相信盂县能办起什么工业来。针对这些思想，县委召开了三次有乡和厂矿的党支部书记、农业社主任参加的会议，辩论盂县能不能办工业、要不要办工业、如何办工业等问题。在辩论中，有些人算了工农业关系账：如果办起工业，今年农业跃进需用的化肥和工具就可以自给，反之，农业也不能跃进。他们认识到，一只脚走路是不行的，必须大力发展工业，工农业并举。但是有些人想不通，他们说办工业虽然重要，总不能白手办工业啊！经过辩论以后，中共县委书记张润槐总结说：我们没钱没技术，但是我们有一条——胆大，有干劲，干起来再说，不能等待！县委立即抽调了四十多名干部，成立了办工业的综合办公室。全县三十一个乡、三百三十九个农业社，也各抽一个书记和主任管工业。同时，县委组织了四个工作组，携带工具，分头深入各区进行宣传，发动群众报矿查矿。工作组每到一村，不是开大会就是进行个别访问，讲开矿办厂的好处和意义，教群众识别矿石。经过群众性的查矿找矿，先后已查出石棉矿、铜矿、铁矿、磷矿、煤炭等六十多种矿。现在，这些矿已大部分在开采。
    群众发动起来以后，什么困难都迎刃而解。没有工具他们自带工具，没有原料就试用土料代替。这个县原来最耽心的是办工业没有资金，可是一经动员，农民们就纷纷取出存款，有的单位把暂时用不到的党费、行政医药费、工会会费都拿了出来。不几天，全县就筹集了二百四十多万元，建设工业需要的资金得到了解决。劳动力也有困难，但是，中共盂县县委认为农村的劳动力潜力还很大，只要想办法就能挖出人力来。他们试办了工厂和矿，摸清土法开矿办厂要多少人，一个劳力一天能干多少活。以后又帮助农业社计算，算农业社的工作量，农业社的男女劳动力，整劳动力和半劳动力，经过全面规划以后，每个农业社都可以抽出8％、10％到16％的人来。办工业的劳动力的问题也得到了解决。
    向群众学习，再去指导群众，这不仅使领导对为数众多的新厂矿都能进行生产领导和技术指导，而且使很多疑难问题及时得到了解决。盂县境内石棉矿很丰富，目前国家很需要，但是群众开采的效率很低，采出来的矿又没法加工。有些人就不愿开采。当工作组正急得没办法的时候，县委指示他们在产石棉量较大的石塘石棉矿试点研究解决办法。工作组和群众商量后，群众就创造了一种采矿工具，并将碾面的碾子加以改进，用来加工石棉，效率大大提高，情绪马上高涨起来。过去从不参加劳动的妇女也都争着碾石棉。
    最近，盂县进一步研究了巩固和提高新厂矿的问题，决定在全县建立七个综合农具修配站，以农具修配站和已有的大厂矿为中心，负责新厂矿的技术指导和帮助试制新厂矿力不能及的新产品。现在，很多新厂矿已和大厂矿建立了联系。
