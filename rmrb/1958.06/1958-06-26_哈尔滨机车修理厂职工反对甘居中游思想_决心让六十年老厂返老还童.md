Harbin, June 25th (By our reporter) – The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is earnestly implementing the Party's General Line, examining, in light of the factory's actual conditions, the long-standing conservative thinking of "old factory, old equipment," that things are now "good enough," and "content with the status quo, settling for mediocrity." After several enlarged meetings of the factory's Party committee for criticism and self-examination, a factory-wide competition to surpass advanced levels has begun.

The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has seen a new atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward in production this year. The factory's total output value plan has increased by 121.7% compared to last year. Various production indicators are steadily rising; however, compared with the nation's advanced rolling stock repair factories, it still ranks in the middle to lower levels. In the first quarter of this year, among thirty-seven production indicators, it ranked first in only eight and last in sixteen. The main root cause of this situation is the one-sided view that "old factory, old equipment," and the complacent feeling that things are "good enough" as they are, which unconsciously fostered a conservative ideology of "content with the status quo, settling for mediocrity."

The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is exactly sixty years old this year. Old machine tools used for more than thirty years account for 36% of all machine tools in the factory, and only twelve new machine tools have been added in recent years. Therefore, some people, after seeing modern factories, developed a sense of inferiority and the erroneous idea that "external factors" determine everything. In response to this situation, leading cadres pointed out in their self-criticism: Emphasizing objective difficulties is essentially wanting to do things slowly. Workshop cadres criticized the factory leadership for not seeing the nation's advanced indicators, and only thinking their own production indicators were constantly rising, resulting in blind complacency.

Through self-examination, everyone realized that emphasizing the objective difficulties of "old factory, old equipment" and the idea of "content with the status quo, settling for mediocrity" was a manifestation of not exerting enough effort and striving for the top. Everyone analyzed: "Old factory, old equipment" are indeed unfavorable conditions, but old factories have many old workers; old workers with more than ten years of service account for 65% of the total number of employees, and Party and League members account for 45% of the employees. 85% of the factory's leadership cadres at all levels are native to the factory. Su Guangming, an old milling worker in the mechanical workshop with twenty-eight years of service, reformed an old German-made milling machine, increasing the number of revolutions from more than two hundred to more than six hundred. However, in the past, the factory did not pay enough attention to the role of the old workers, holding the view of "seeing things but not people."

While examining and criticizing conservative ideas, the factory has also been exerting great effort and striving to reach the top. Leading cadres in each workshop, in the spirit of the General Line, announced the production indicators of the nation's advanced rolling stock factories and compared them with their own workshop's indicators; those lagging behind must catch up, and those already advanced must become even more advanced.

As a result of the self-examination conducted in the spirit of the General Line, leading cadres at all levels throughout the factory are full of confidence and striving for the top; and are filled with the great ambition of transforming the repair factory into a manufacturing factory. The sixty-year-old outdated repair factory will be transformed into a modern new factory capable of manufacturing tens of thousands of freight cars and producing more than one hundred thousand tons of cast steel. Now, the fighting slogan of all employees in the factory is: Work hard for three years to rejuvenate the sixty-year-old factory, and work hard for three months, strive to be the best, and change the current production situation.

    哈尔滨机车修理厂职工反对甘居中游思想
    决心让六十年老厂返老还童
    本报哈尔滨25日电　哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂，认真贯彻党的总路线，结合本厂的实际情况，检查了长期存在的：“老工厂、设备旧”现在搞得“差不多”的“安于现状，甘居中下游”的保守思想。经过工厂党委几次扩大会的批判检查，一个全厂性的比上游的竞赛已经开始。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂今年在生产上出现了大跃进的新面貌。全厂的生产总产值计划已比去年增长了121.7％。各项生产指标都在步步上升；但是与全国各先进的车辆修理厂比较，还是属于中下游。今年第一季度在三十七项生产指标中，占第一的只有八项，属最末的有十六项。这种状况的形成，主要根源是片面认为“老工厂、设备旧”，搞到现在这个样子已经“差不多”的自满情绪，使人们不自觉地滋长了一种“安于现状，甘居中下游”的保守思想。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂今年整整六十年。全厂用过三十年以上的老机床占全部机床的36％，几年来增添的新机床只有十二台。所以，有的人看了现代化工厂后，产生自卑感，有了“外因”决定一切的错误思想。针对这一情况，领导干部在检查中指出：强调客观困难的实质是想慢慢腾腾地干。车间干部批判工厂的领导看不到全国的先进指标，只认为自己的生产指标在不断上升，产生了盲目自满情绪。
    经过检查，大家认识到过去强调“老工厂、设备旧”的客观困难和“安于现状，甘居中下游”的思想，是没有鼓足干劲，力争上游的表现。大家分析：“老工厂、设备旧”固是不利条件，但是老工厂老工人多，十年以上工龄的老工人占职工总数的65％，党、团员占职工总数的45％，工厂各级领导干部有85％是本厂土生土长的。这个厂机械车间有二十八年工龄的老铣工苏广铭，他用的一台德国制的旧铣床，经过改革，将这台铣床的转数由二百多转增加到六百多转。但是，过去厂里对老工人的作用重视不够，有“见物不见人”的思想。
    这个厂在检查批判保守思想的同时，就鼓足干劲，力争上游。各个车间的领导干部以总路线的精神，公布全国先进的车辆厂的生产指标和本车间的指标对比，落后的要赶上去，先进的要再先进。
    以总路线精神进行检查的结果，全厂各级领导干部都信心百倍，力争上游；而且在实现变修理厂为制造厂的雄心大志。六十年的陈旧修理厂将要变成一个能够制造成万台货车，铸钢产量达十万吨以上的现代化新工厂了。现在，全厂职工的战斗口号是：苦战三年，使六十年的老厂返老还童，苦战三月，力争上游，改变现在的生产面貌。
