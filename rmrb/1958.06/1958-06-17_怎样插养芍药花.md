    How to Propagate Peonies in Vases
    These days, there are large quantities of peony buds for sale on the streets of Beijing. For those who don't know how to grow flowers themselves, or don't have the conditions to do so, buying a bunch to put in a vase in the room, although not as naturally graceful as a whole plant, can still be enjoyed for ten days or so if cared for properly.
    To make all the bought flower branches bloom and last, you need to pay attention to the different characteristics of each flower. Take peonies, for example. Before putting them in a vase, it is best to char the ends of the flower stems with a candle flame (do not use a stove fire to avoid scorching the leaves), and then insert them into clear water. This prevents the sap from draining out and promotes water absorption. At night, take the flower branches out of the vase and put them in a deep bucket of water, submerging the branches and leaves, leaving the flower heads exposed. Put them back in the vase in the morning. This will ensure that all the buds bloom and last longer.
    If the bought flower branches already show signs of wilting, you can char the ends of the flower stems and immediately soak them in alcohol for about a minute, then rinse them in clear water, which can revive them.
    Lilacs, roses, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks, and other flowers can all be propagated in vases using the above method. The flower vase should be placed in a bright and ventilated place indoors, not in a dead corner, and should not be exposed to sunlight or direct wind. (Fang You)

    怎样插养芍药花
    这几天北京街上有大批芍药花苞出售，自己不会种花，或者没有条件种花，买一把回去插在房间里，虽然不如整棵的天然多姿，但是养好了也可以观赏十来天。
    要使买来的花枝全部盛开并且耐久，按照各种花性不同颇有点讲究。以芍药来说，在插入瓶中之前，最好用腊烛火将花梗末端烧焦成炭（不要用炉火以免将花叶灼伤），然后插入清水中。这样一面阻止了滋浆下泄，一面能促进水分上升。晚上，将花枝从瓶中取出，放入深水桶中，浸没枝叶，露出花头，清晨再回插瓶中。这样就能使花苞全放而且耐久。
    如果买回来的花枝已有枯萎的现象，可在花梗末端烧焦后，立即浸入酒精中约一分钟，再放入清水中漂清，可以使它回苏。
    丁香、蔷薇、菊花、秋葵等花都可用上法插瓶。花瓶宜放在室内明亮通风处，不要摆在死角，也不要在日光下曝晒和直接吹风。（芳友）
