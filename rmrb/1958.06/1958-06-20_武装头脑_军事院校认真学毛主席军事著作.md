    Arming the Mind
    Military Academies Conscientiously Study Chairman Mao's Military Writings
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th – Military academies of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have begun to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's military writings. Many units and schools have already designated the study of Chairman Mao's military writings as an important task, determined to arm their minds with Mao Zedong's military thought and accelerate their journey towards becoming excellent, modern, and revolutionary armed forces.
    The upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works in military academies and units is unfolding vigorously in conjunction with the rectification movement. The General Senior Infantry School began on March 24th to concentrate on-the-job cadres in batches for short-term study of works such as "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" and "On Protracted War." They also required students to comprehend the spirit and essence of the works during the study, closely integrate theory with practice, write study心得 [xīndé, notes and thoughts gained through study or work], and ensure a combination of thinking, reading, discussing, reading aloud, and writing. The Political Academy decided to immediately establish a Research Committee on Chairman Mao's Works, with the Party's resolutions and Chairman Mao's works serving as the main content of future teaching. A naval aviation school, while stipulating that cadres at or above the level of section and department heads complete the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" this year, has formulated a long-term plan for all cadres to complete the study of Chairman Mao's military writings within three years. While universally organizing officers at all levels to study Chairman Mao's works, many air force units have also decided that leading cadres should take the lead in learning, in order to prepare guidance resources for the widespread展开 [zhǎnkāi, to launch; to develop] of study.
    Studying Chairman Mao's military writings has liberated people's thinking and greatly improved the combat effectiveness and teaching quality of the troops. In combat, a certain air defense unit, based on the enemy aircraft's activity patterns, researched and developed some combat methods, quickly expanding the results of the battle, and continuously shooting down or damaging seven enemy aircraft in four months. After the battle, the commanders said that this was a victory for Mao Zedong's military thought. After studying Chairman Mao's military writings, military academies such as the Senior Engineering Corps School actively implemented the mass line in teaching and promoted the spirit of originality, resulting in an unprecedentedly vibrant new situation in teaching work. The professorial committees and research institutions of the General Senior Infantry School also used Mao Zedong's military thought as the commander in chief, actively inspected and improved work, and a new atmosphere of focusing on reality, emphasizing political factors, and Party leadership emerged in teaching.

    武装头脑
    军事院校认真学毛主席军事著作
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军各军事院校开始认真学习毛主席的军事著作。不少部队和学校已经把学习毛主席军事著作列为一项重要任务，决心以毛主席的军事思想武装自己的头脑，加速向优良的现代化革命军队目标兼程迈进。
    各军事院校和部队学习毛主席著作的热潮，是结合着整风运动蓬勃展开的。总高级步兵学校自3月24日就开始分批短期集中在职干部，学习“中国革命战争的战略问题”和“论持久战”等著作，并且要求学员在学习中领会著作的精神和实质，紧密联系实际，写出学习心得，作到想、看、谈、读、写并举。政治学院决定立即着手成立毛主席著作研究委员会，以党的决议和毛主席的著作作为今后教学的主要内容。海军某航校在规定处、科长以上干部今年学完“实践论”、“矛盾论”的同时，为全体干部三年之内学完毛主席军事著作制定了长远规划。空军部队在普遍组织各级军官学习毛主席著作的同时，不少部队还决定领导干部先学一步，为普遍展开学习准备辅导力量。
    学习毛主席军事著作，解放了人们的思想，大大提高了部队的战斗力和教学质量。空防部队某部在作战中，根据敌机活动规律，研究出一些作战方法，很快扩大了战果，四个月内连续击落击伤敌机七架。战斗结束后，指挥员们说，这是毛主席军事思想的胜利。高级工程兵学校等军事院校学习毛主席军事著作后，在教学中积极贯彻群众路线，发扬独创精神，使教学工作出现了空前活跃的新局面。总高级步兵学校各教授会和研究机构，还以毛主席军事思想为统帅，积极检查改进工作，在教学中出现了注重实际、重视政治因素和党的领导的新气象。
