Overnight Construction of a Dam
By our reporter Shi Zhengzhang

In one night, a dam was built on the "ten-foot silt" of the Wo River, serving summer planting. This miracle happened in Dongmiao Cooperative in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province. Before the cooperative consolidation, this cooperative was a backward, third-class cooperative with only a little over 190 households.

The Huaibei Plain has not had a thorough rain for a long time, and fighting drought and seizing planting has become the most urgent task at present. Dongmiao Cooperative suffers severely from drought because of its high terrain, and most of the ditches and ponds are shallow and not connected to the groundwater.

More than 1,000 mu of paddy fields that the cooperative planned to convert have been prepared, but there is no water for transplanting rice seedlings; more than 1,300 mu of sweet potatoes also cannot be planted due to lack of water. After four days and nights of hard work, the cooperative members rushed to harvest more than 2,000 mu of wheat and immediately concentrated their labor force to fight drought and seize planting. All the children who could lift water cans were also mobilized. Despite this, due to the lack of water sources, the limited water in the few deep ditches and the almost exhausted well water were only enough to keep the rice and sweet potato seedlings alive. Originally, it was thought that digging a water diversion ditch by the Wo River would solve the problem, but the river water kept dropping. After the cooperative members dug for six days and six nights, and were about to finish the water diversion ditch, the river water had dropped sharply and could not enter the ditch.

This was an emergency for the entire cooperative. On June 11, the cooperative held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The Party branch proposed continuing to repair the water diversion ditch on the one hand, and building a dam across the river on the other hand to raise the water level for irrigation. This proposal was supported by the cadres and the masses. The decision was made in the afternoon, and work began that night.

When this reporter arrived at the Wo River dam construction site, it was already past 10 p.m. Gas lamps illuminated the river beach brightly. Ox carts brought the grass bags and wooden stakes for dam construction, and male and female cooperative members also rushed to the construction site one after another. Some of them had just finished the last batch of wheat (threshing three batches a day) and came here specifically; others came after watering the sweet potato seedlings and putting down their water cans. At the upper reaches of the dam site, sixty cooperative members were still digging the water diversion ditch overnight. The silt here is very thick, and it collapses as soon as it is dug, but everyone is not discouraged. They have entered the seventh night of the ditch digging battle, and no one has complained of fatigue. Jin Kaiying, the seventeen-year-old female youth leader, was covered in mud, but she was still singing folk songs to encourage everyone to work harder. The cooperative members all proposed to learn from Jin Kaiying. No matter how much silt there is, if it collapses quickly, we will dig even faster. We will not withdraw from the front line until the water diversion ditch is completed.

At 11 o'clock, the dam construction project began as tensely as flood prevention and rescue. Hundreds of people carrying earth, hummed labor chants in response to each other, and baskets of earth were poured into the river. In their ranks, some people were still hesitant about cooperativization before the cooperative consolidation, and a few even clamored to withdraw from the cooperative. Cooperative member Pan Mingfu only cared about private sideline business after joining the cooperative and even applied to withdraw from the cooperative. Tonight, he came the earliest and carried soil baskets back and forth with full energy. Zhang Genfu, the newly elected production team leader after the cooperative consolidation, was the first to jump into the water and led the cooperative members to undertake the most arduous task - driving piles.

The dam body extended from both sides of the river to the center at the same time. Every foot of progress brought several times the tension to the cooperative members. Everyone dared not relax, fearing that the smaller the gap in the middle when the two sides were built closer and closer to the center, the greater the impact of the water would be. A slight carelessness would cause it to be washed away and all previous efforts would be wasted. Every time a grass bag was thrown into the river, more than a dozen people jumped down and pressed the grass bag with their bodies until dozens of loads of earth had subdued the grass bag before they dared to leave. In this way, they fought without a break all night. At dawn, the dam body had closed and had been built out of the water. The river water had risen by more than a foot and was flowing along the newly dug water diversion ditch. At this time, the cooperative members cheered. Some said: The slogan "Fight hard all night, let the river serve us" has been realized! Some said: "We can still plant rice without relying on the heavens." Cooperative members Qiu Yusheng and Zhang Heyun composed folk songs on the spot to sing about the victory: "Cooperative members are making a great leap forward in fighting drought, everyone is very happy; don't sleep all night until dawn, the dam is completed at sunrise; rice and sweet potatoes are all planted, and each mu can yield tens of millions of catties..."

    一夜筑成拦河坝
    本报记者  石正章
    一夜功夫，就在“淤泥十尺”的涡河上打起了拦河坝，叫河水为夏种服务。这个奇迹出在安徽省怀远县的东庙社。这个社只有一百九十多户，在整社前还是个落后的三类社。
    淮北平原长久没有下过透雨了，抗旱抢种成了当前最迫切的任务。东庙社因为地势高，多数沟塘挖得浅，没有接上地下水，旱象特重。
    社里一千多亩改种水稻的田已经整好，但没有水插秧；一千三百多亩山芋也因缺水栽不下去。社员们苦战了四昼夜，抢先把二千多亩小麦收到家后，立即集中劳力投入了抗旱抢种。所有能提得起水罐的小孩，也都被动员了起来。尽管这样，但由于水源缺乏，仅有的几条深沟的积水和几乎枯竭的井水，只够用来保活水稻秧苗和山芋秧苗的命。本来以为在涡河边挖条引水沟就可解决问题，但河水又老是往下跌。当社员们挖了六天六夜，快要把引水沟挖好时，河水已猛降得不能进沟了。
    这是全社的一件紧急大事。6月11日，社里便开会商量对策。党支部提出了一面继续修引水沟，一面拦河打坝，抬高水位，以便引水灌田。这个建议得到了干部和群众的拥护，下午作出决定，晚上就动手。
    记者赶到涡河筑坝工地时，已是晚上十点多钟了。汽油灯把河滩照得通明，一辆辆牛车把打坝用的草包、木桩运来了，男女社员也陆续赶到工地。他们有的是刚打完最后一场小麦（一天要打三场）又特地赶来的；有的是趁夜浇了山芋秧刚放下水罐就来的。在坝址的上首，六十个社员仍然在连夜挖引水沟。这里的淤泥很大，前边挖后边就塌，可是大家都不灰心。他们已进入第七个夜晚的挖沟战斗了，谁也没有叫一声累。十七岁的女青年队长金开英，一身都成了“泥人”，她还是唱着山歌，鼓励大家加油干。社员们都提出要向金开英学习，不管淤泥有多大，它塌得快，我们挖得更快，不开好引水沟，誓不下火线。
    十一点钟了，筑坝工程一开始，就和防汛抢险一样紧张。成百个抬土的人，一呼一应地哼着劳动的号子，一筐筐的土往河里倾泻。在他们的行列里，有些人在整社前对合作化还是三心二意的，少数人还闹着要退社。社员潘明福入社后只顾搞私人副业，还申请退社。今晚他来得最早，劲头十足地抬着土筐来回快跑。整社后被社员新选出的生产队长张根福，他第一个跳下了水，带领社员担负了最艰苦的任务——打桩。
    坝身从河的两边同时向中央伸展着，每前进一尺，就给社员带来几倍的紧张，个个都不敢松劲，怕两边越筑越往当中靠拢时，当中的缺口越小，水的冲力越大，稍一大意，就会被水冲毁而前功尽弃。每当一个草包投入河中时，就有十几个人跳下去用身体压住草包，一直等几十担土把草包压服才敢离开。就这样没有间隙地战斗了一夜，天亮时，坝身已合拢而且已筑出水面了，河水提高了一尺多，正顺着新挖的引水沟流去。这时，社员们欢腾起来了。有的说：“苦战一夜，叫河水为我们服务”的口号实现了！有的说：“不靠天也能照样种水稻了”。社员丘玉盛和张和云当时就编出山歌来歌唱胜利：“社员抗旱大跃进，个个干得真高兴；一夜到亮不睡觉，大坝日出就完成；水稻山芋都栽上，每亩能收千万斤……。”
