Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th June: The Minister of Industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Le Thanh Nghi, announced that many small industrial research stations will be established in the deltas and some mountainous areas of Vietnam. He pointed out that the purpose of establishing these research stations is to bring scientific and technological research work closer to the masses and to give full play to the initiative and creativity of the masses to solve problems in scientific research.

Le Thanh Nghi made the above remarks at a conference where various industrial sectors jointly discussed the development of science and technology. This conference is currently being held in Hanoi.

Le Thanh Nghi pointed out that while making full use of the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, it is necessary to develop scientific and technological research into a mass movement.

Le Thanh Nghi said that the policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the development of science and technology can only be a socialist policy. This policy is: to continuously expand and improve production on the basis of advanced technology, to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing needs of society, to continuously improve the lives of the people, and to give scientists and technical workers full opportunities to improve their abilities.

Le Thanh Nghi said that the current task is to gradually improve the technology, equipment and tools of production in order to increase labor productivity, ensure the quantity and quality of products, and reduce production costs. He also said that in order to meet the needs of agricultural production, it is necessary to improve agricultural tools and establish processing industries for agricultural, forestry and fishery products.
