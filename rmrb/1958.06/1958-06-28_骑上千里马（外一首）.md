    Riding the Steed
      Zang Kejia
    Riding the steed, riding the steed, chasing John Bull, the crackling dust and smoke soar to the sky, the horse in front, the bull behind.
    The Songs Can't Be Finished
    I
    One glance at the wall, poetic lines illuminate the eye; walking on the street, recitation sounds spread; opening the envelope, poetic leaflets fly; the east wind stirs the heart, the songs can't be finished.
    II
    Past poets, wearing long hair, wearing laurel wreaths; today's singers, holding axes, holding hoes; in the past, those who read poetry, only numbered hundreds and thousands, today those who read poetry, already number hundreds of millions, the working people have opened up new horizons in life, the working people have created new gardens of poetry.
    III
    Creative enthusiasm surges from the heart, turning into song at the lips, the song grows with life, more and more each day.

    骑上千里马
    （外一首）
      臧克家
    骑上千里马骑上千里马，追赶约翰牛，噼啪尘烟冲天起，马儿在前牛在后。
    歌儿唱不完
    一举目望墙头，诗句照人眼；行走在街头，朗诵声音传；拆开来信封，飞来诗传单；东风撩人心，歌儿唱不完。
    二过去的诗人，披着长发，戴着桂冠；今天的歌手，拿着斧头，拿着锄镰；过去读诗的人，只有几百几千，今天读诗的人，已经上亿上万，劳动人民开辟了生活的新天地，劳动人民创造了诗歌的新田园。
    三创造热情冲心窝，到了嘴边化成歌，歌儿随着生活长，一天比着一天多。
