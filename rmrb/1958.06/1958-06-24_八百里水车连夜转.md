Eight hundred li of waterwheels turning all night,
Eight hundred li of waves reaching to the horizon,
Eight hundred li of bright moon like a lamp,
Eight hundred li of shadows like flying arrows.
Liberation-style waterwheels like bugles,
Iron-bucket waterwheels like drumbeats,
Songs from the east surge out of Tong Pass,
Whistles from the west fly over Zhongnan Mountain.
Pushing the waterwheel is pushing the era,
We have subdued nature;
Pushing it makes the moon fall behind,
Pushing it makes the sun glare!

    八百里水车连夜转
    李晓白八百里水车连夜转，八百里浪花向天边，八百里明月一盏灯，八百里人影似飞箭。解放式水车如号角，铁斗子水车像鼓点，东边的歌声涌出潼关外，西边的口哨飞过终南山。推水车就是推时代，我们降服了大自然；推得那月儿掉了队，推得那日头瞪起眼！
