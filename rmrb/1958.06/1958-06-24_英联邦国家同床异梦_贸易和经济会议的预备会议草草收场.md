Xinhua News Agency, London, June 23rd: (By our correspondent Peng Di) The preparatory meeting for the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference, scheduled to be held in Montreal, Canada, in September this year, concluded here last week. No concrete agreements were reached at the preparatory meeting.

　　The preparatory meeting lasted for three weeks. Officials from eleven Commonwealth countries participated in the preparatory meeting, and they discussed many economic issues. However, no one was prepared to undertake any specific obligations, and no one was prepared to take measures to solve these problems.

　　Many of the issues they discussed involved conflicts of interest between Britain and other Commonwealth countries. For example, regarding the issue of providing funds for the economic development of Commonwealth countries, most Commonwealth countries expect capital investment or assistance from Britain. However, Britain, whose own economy is still in difficulty, is looking to the United States and West Germany for assistance and capital investment. In fact, one of the main purposes of Macmillan's visit to Washington was to ask the United States for more economic aid, but the United States, bogged down by its own economic crisis, is not enthusiastic about "defending the Sterling Area."

　　On the issue of "Imperial Preference," there are also conflicting interests. Commonwealth countries that produce raw materials have been harmed by the decline in raw material prices in the capitalist world, and they expect to maintain their traditional, protected markets in Britain. However, Britain, which has benefited greatly from the decline in raw material import prices, is not interested in the above-mentioned demands of Commonwealth countries.

　　Regarding the establishment of the so-called "European Free Trade Area," everyone's ideas are also different. Britain's eagerness to link up with the "Common Market" of the six "Little Europe" countries has caused serious concern and fear among some Commonwealth agricultural countries. These countries are very worried that their interests in exporting agricultural products and other items will be damaged as a result. According to the "Sunday Observer," at the preparatory meeting, some countries expressed the hope that some of the products they produce would not be included in the scope of "European Free Trade." The newspaper said that the British government is naturally very unwilling to tie its hands by accepting lists of non-negotiable items before holding decisive negotiations with Western Europe.

### 英联邦国家同床异梦  贸易和经济会议的预备会议草草收场

    英联邦国家同床异梦
    贸易和经济会议的预备会议草草收场
    据新华社伦敦23日电  本社记者彭迪报道：定在今年9月在加拿大的蒙特利尔召开的英联邦贸易和经济会议的预备会议，上星期已经在这里闭幕。在预备会议上并没有达成什么具体的协议。
    预备会议举行了三个星期。参加预备会议的有十一个英联邦国家的官员们，他们讨论了许多经济问题。但是，谁也没有准备承担任何具体的义务，谁也没有准备采取措施来解决这些问题。
    他们讨论的许多问题都牵涉到英国同其他英联邦国家的利益冲突。例如，关于为英联邦国家提供发展经济的资金问题，大多数英联邦国家都指望英国的资本投资或援助。而自己的经济也还处在困难之中的英国，却正在指望美国和西德给予援助和资本投资。事实上，麦克米伦访问华盛顿的主要目的之一就是要求美国给予更多的经济援助，但是，被它自己的经济危机缠住的美国，对于“保卫英镑地区”并不热心。
    在关于“帝国优惠制”的问题上，同样存在着利害冲突。生产原料的英联邦国家由于资本主义世界原料价格下跌而受到损害，它们指望在英国保持它们传统的、受到保护的市场。但是，由于原料进口价格下跌而得到很大好处的英国，对于英联邦国家的上述要求并不感兴趣。
    在关于建立所谓“欧洲自由贸易区”的问题上，各人的想法也不一样。英国急于要同“小欧洲”六国的“共同市场”联系起来，这一点引起了英联邦某些农业国家严重的忧虑和恐惧。这些国家非常担心它们在出口农产品等方面的利益会因此而遭到损害。据“星期日观察周报”报道，在预备会议上，一些国家表示希望它们所生产的某些产品将不包括在“欧洲自由贸易”的范围以内。这家报纸说，英国政府自然非常不愿意在同西欧举行决定性的谈判之前接受那些不能谈判的项目的名单，这样来绑住自己的手足。
