    深入宣传总路线
    志愿军干劲大增
    新华社平壤13日电　中国人民志愿军各部队最近掀起了一个群众性的宣传社会主义建设总路线的热潮。
    这些天来，许多部队都出动了由大批将军、校官、尉官、士兵和职工组成的宣传队伍，运用各种各样的宣传形式，深入部队宣传总路线。6月8日，志愿军政治部副主任丁莱夫少将参加了宣传队伍，并且向一千五百多名官兵和职工宣传了总路线。许多部队的军政首长还深入伙房和理发室读报、说快板，讲解总路线。在医院里，护士和病人，病人和病人之间，也都展开了生动活泼的宣传总路线的活动，真正作到了人人宣传，个个皆知。志愿军各部队文工团在宣传活动中更是活跃，他们带着大批新创作的宣传总路线的文艺节目，连日爬山越野演给战士们看。
    总路线给志愿军广大官兵带来了巨大的鼓舞。在定州水库工地上，官兵们提出要把鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的精神，贯彻到帮助朝鲜人民进行水库工程建设中去。单推土的施工效率，这几天就由两人日推十立方提高到了十六立方。在总路线的鼓舞下，各部队群众性的发明创造和技术革新运动也频传捷报。不少部队正以总路线的精神，发挥冲天干劲，把密切中朝友谊的活动推向新的高潮。
