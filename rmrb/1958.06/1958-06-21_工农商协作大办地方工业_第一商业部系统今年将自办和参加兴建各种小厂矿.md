Industry-Agriculture-Commerce Collaboration Vigorously Develops Local Industries
The First Ministry of Commerce System Will Self-Operate and Participate in the Construction of Various Small Factories and Mines This Year

(Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Commerce system is collaborating with various sectors to vigorously develop small-scale local industries. According to plans submitted by commercial departments in various regions, this year they will self-operate and participate in the construction of 3,800 small-scale iron smelting furnaces, over 1,400 small-scale chemical raw material plants, 30 bearing factories, 5 silicon steel sheet factories, and various wild fiber processing plants, pharmaceutical factories, medical equipment repair and assembly plants, etc.

These factories will largely be built or expanded using indigenous methods. Once put into production, they are expected to produce 3 million tons of pig iron, 250,000 tons of steel, 100,000 tons of copper, over 2.2 million sets of bearings, 69 types of chemical raw material products annually.

Since the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, commodities operated by commercial departments such as hardware, transportation, electrical engineering materials, and chemical raw materials have experienced a serious situation of supply falling short of demand. To reverse this situation, commercial departments are striving to move forward, changing the situation of reaching out to the state for sources of goods, and adopting the method of increasing sources of goods by starting from production to meet supply. The Tianjin Transportation Electrical Engineering Materials Purchasing and Supply Station independently and in a short period of time successfully trial-produced the main raw material for the electromechanical industry - silicon steel sheets. The Yunyang County Nanxi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province rapidly built 88 small factories by means of self-operation, joint operation with agricultural cooperatives, etc., and massively produced iron ore, sulfur, coal, lime, sodium nitrate, rayon, starch, sugar, wine and other products.

The issue of whether there are conflicts between commercial departments participating in production and organizing production and the industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as specific practices, were discussed at a series of supply meetings recently convened by the First Ministry of Commerce. The meetings held that commercial departments participating in production is not taking care of everything, let alone abandoning commerce to engage in industry, but rather using the many favorable conditions of commercial work to actively promote the development of industrial and agricultural production through various means. For example, commercial departments can provide assistance to industrial departments in terms of funds and equipment; they can use the characteristics of a wide range of work contacts to widely disseminate typical experiences in production from various regions, especially the experience of indigenous production methods that are easy to promote. The meeting held that commercial departments themselves can also run some demonstrative small factories when necessary. However, the principle of running these factories is not to compete with state-owned industrial departments for raw materials, markets, or profits, and it is necessary to cooperate with all parties, especially with industrial departments. Anything that industrial departments can do should be done by industrial departments, and commercial departments can help them do it; if industrial departments do not plan to do it now but it is urgently needed, commercial departments can do it themselves, and in the future, when industrial departments need it, they can transfer it to industrial departments for unified management. Commercial departments should also cooperate with agricultural cooperatives to help or cooperate with agricultural cooperatives to run some small processing and mining factories and mines. Therefore, commercial departments organizing production and participating in production will not only not conflict with the industrial and agricultural sectors, but will also become a powerful assistant in promoting production.

In order to do a good job in organizing and participating in production, the First Ministry of Commerce has made specific arrangements for issues such as sources of funds and cultivation of technical forces.

    工农商协作大办地方工业
    第一商业部系统今年将自办和参加兴建各种小厂矿
    本报讯　第一商业部系统和各方面协作，大办小型地方工业。根据各地商业部门提出的规划，今年将自办和参与兴建各种小型炼铁炉三千八百座、小型化工原料厂一千四百多个、轴承厂三十个、硅钢片厂五个和各种野生纤维加工厂、制药厂、医疗器械修配厂等等。
    这些工厂将大量采用土法兴建或扩建，投入生产后预计可年产生铁三百万吨、钢二十五万吨、铜十万吨、轴承二百二十多万套、化工原料产品六十九种。
    工农业大跃进以来，商业部门经营的五金交通电工器材和化工原料等商品出现了严重的供不应求的局面。为了扭转这种局面，商业部门力争上游，改变伸手向国家要货源的情况，采取了从生产入手增加货源以满足供应的办法。天津市交通电工器材采购供应站自己动手在很短的时间内试制成功了机电工业的主要原料——硅钢片。四川省云阳县南溪供销社采取自办、与农业社合办等方式，迅速建成了小型工厂八十八个，大量生产铁矿、硫磺、煤炭、石灰、土硝、人造棉、淀粉、糖、酒等产品。
    商业部门参与生产和组织生产与工农业部门有没有矛盾以及具体的作法的问题，在第一商业部最近召开的一连串的供应会议上进行了讨论。会议认为，商业部门参与生产并不是包办一切，更不是丢开商业去搞工业，而是利用商业工作的许多有利条件，积极地通过各种方式来促进工农业生产的发展。例如商业部门可以在资金和设备方面给工业部门以帮助；可以利用工作接触面较广的特点，广为传播各地生产中的典型经验，特别是易于推行的土法生产的经验。会议认为，商业部门本身在必要时也可以举办一些示范性的小型工厂。但是在办这些工厂时以不与国营工业部门争原料、争市场、争利润为原则，并且要和各方面协作，首先要和工业部门协作。凡是工业部门能办的都由工业部门去办，商业部门可以帮助他们办；工业部门现在不打算办而又迫切需要的，商业部门自己办，将来工业部门需要时可以转交给工业部门统一管理。商业部门也要同农业合作社协作，帮助或者同农业社合作办一些小型的加工、采矿的厂矿。因此，商业部门组织生产和参与生产，不但不会和工农业部门发生矛盾，而且会成为推动生产的有力的助手。
    为了做好组织和参与生产的工作，第一商业部已对资金来源和培养技术力量等问题作了具体安排。
