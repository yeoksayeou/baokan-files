Is it Coercive or Suitable?

Shu Jun

    The ideological remolding movement of intellectuals in various universities and colleges in the capital has come to an end and achieved great success. The ideological outlook of many teachers has been completely renewed. The new task now facing the vast number of teachers is to implement the general line of socialist construction, thoroughly uproot the white flag of the bourgeoisie in teaching and scientific research, plant the red flag of the proletariat, and strive for a great leap forward in the work of universities and colleges.

    The key to a great leap forward in the work of universities and colleges is, first and foremost, ideological liberation. It must be understood that the ideological remolding movement in the previous stage mainly focused on the struggle against individualism and the two roads in terms of political ideology. Although bourgeois educational and academic thoughts have been hit to a certain extent, they have not been thoroughly criticized. Many old teachers are still carrying the two heavy burdens of superstition in Western capitalist decadent culture and the feudal culture of old China. They believe in foreigners, believe in ancient people, despise the modern, and despise practice. For many years, they have been holding onto the old and refusing to let go. Their vision is short-sighted, and they cannot critically use their knowledge to serve the people, but instead, they act as slaves and propagandists of bourgeois academic thought. This has caused the teaching and scientific research work in universities and colleges to stagnate and remain conservative in many areas.

    Bourgeois ideology in teaching and scientific research still reflects the struggle between the two roads and the two methods. If it is not thoroughly criticized, not only will teaching and scientific research not be able to achieve a great leap forward, but ideological remolding will also not be able to achieve a complete victory.

    Not all teachers understand this principle. Although some people feel that the old ways are no longer working and that the situation is pressing, they are full of worries and lack the courage and confidence to move forward. There are also a few people who are resistant to teaching reform and cling to bourgeois viewpoints. Obviously, this hesitation and antagonism cannot uproot the bourgeois white flag in teaching and scientific research, plant the socialist red flag, nor can it develop education and scientific research in a faster, better, and more economical way. This runs counter to the general line of socialist construction. What will happen if it cannot adapt to the needs of the development of the situation, and even hinders the development of the situation, under today's situation of the great leap forward in socialism? It will only be eliminated. This is the reason for the so-called "coercive situation." If one can adapt to the development of the situation, then one will not feel "coerced by the situation," but will feel that "the situation is suitable." Will they be eliminated? Or will they strive to move forward with the development of the situation? It should be said that everyone will consciously take the latter path.

    Under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the working people of the whole country are making a comprehensive leap forward in the construction of industry, agriculture, and other aspects. Teaching and scientific research must catch up. Therefore, all teachers in universities and colleges must continue to work hard to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, dare to break through conventions on the basis of establishing the critical and revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, promote the spirit of hard work and solid work, implement great rectification and great changes in teaching and scientific research, make great destruction and great establishment, do everything possible to serve the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, implement the educational policy put forward by Chairman Mao, and strive to run communist universities well. We must go all out, aim high, accelerate self-remolding at the fastest speed, let the red flag be planted in the minds of every teacher, and in the teaching and scientific research work of the school, and carry out the ideological remolding of intellectuals to the end!

    是逼人还是宜人？
    树俊
    首都各高等学校的知识分子思想改造运动已经告一段落，获得了巨大的成绩。许多教师的思想面貌，已经焕然一新。现在摆在广大教师面前的新任务是贯彻社会主义建设总路线，在教学和科学研究工作中彻底拔掉资产阶级的白旗，插上无产阶级的红旗，争取高等学校工作的大跃进。
    高等学校工作大跃进的关键首先是思想大解放。要了解，前一阶段的思想改造运动，主要是从政治思想上搞臭个人主义的两条道路的斗争，至于资产阶级教育思想和学术思想，虽然受到了一定的打击，但是还没有受到彻底的批判。不少老教师还背着迷信西方资本主义没落时期的文化和旧中国封建文化这两个沉重的包袱。迷信洋人，迷信古人，轻视现代，轻视实践。多年来抱残守缺。眼光短浅，不能够批判地运用自己的知识为人民服务，却作了资产阶级学术思想的奴隶和宣传员。这就使高等学校的教学和科学研究工作在很多地方陷于停滞保守状态。
    在教学和科学研究中的资产阶级思想，仍然反映着两条道路和两种方法的斗争。如果不彻底批判，不仅教学和科学研究不能大跃进，思想改造也不可能取得彻底胜利。
    这个道理，并非所有教师都了解。有些人虽然感到老一套不行时了，感到形势逼人，可是顾虑重重，缺乏前进的勇气和信心。也还有少数人对教学改革有抵触情绪，死抱着资产阶级观点不放。显然，这种犹豫和对立的思想情绪，不可能拔掉教学和科学研究中的资产阶级白旗，插上社会主义的红旗，也不可能多快好省地发展教育事业和科学研究事业。这是和社会主义建设总路线背道而驰的。不能适应形势发展的需要，甚而阻碍形势的发展，在今天的社会主义大跃进的形势下，会怎么样呢？只有被淘汰了。这就是所谓“形势逼人”的道理。如果能适应形势的发展，那就不会有“形势逼人”之感，而会觉得“形势宜人”了。是被淘汰呢？还是力争上游，随着形势的发展一同前进呢？应该说，大家是会自觉地走后一条道路的。
    全国劳动人民，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，工农业和其他方面建设事业都在全面大跃进。教学和科学研究必须迎头赶上去。因此，高等学校中的全体教师要继续努力彻底破除资产阶级思想，在树立马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的精神的基础上，敢于冲破陈规，发扬苦干实干的精神，在教学和科学研究方面实行大整大改，大破大立，千方百计地为工农业大跃进服务，贯彻执行毛主席提出的教育方针，为办好共产主义大学而努力。我们必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，以最快的速度，加速自我改造，让红旗插在每个教师的思想上，插在学校的教学和科学研究工作上，把知识分子的思想改造进行到底！
