Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: TASS Moscow, 5th: On June 3rd, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Menshikov handed a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to the US State Department to be forwarded to President Eisenhower.

The full text of this letter was published in the "Pravda" on June 6th. The full text of the letter is as follows:
Respectable Mr. President:

I am writing this letter to you in order to once again address an issue on which our two governments have recently exchanged certain opinions, and which the Soviet government considers to be of great importance. This is the issue of ways to improve and develop Soviet-American relations. In my opinion, it should be considered that the possibility of solving this problem is very great, and it has not been well utilized so far.

The Soviet-American agreement on cultural, technical and educational exchanges that was signed not long ago, we believe, is a good practical step to bring us closer to each other. We are pleased to see that the signing of this agreement has been supported by broad social strata in the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries. I think the reason why it is so welcomed is primarily because people of all countries believe that this agreement specifically proves that Soviet-American relations can be truly improved, and it gives rise to a hope that the current unstable and disturbing international situation may also have an overall improvement.

If we want to live up to these hopes of millions upon millions of people, we should work together to resolve urgent common international problems through peaceful negotiations – we believe the summit meeting of national leaders proposed by the Soviet Union would help with this; at the same time, we should also jointly devote ourselves to developing direct relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

After carefully considering the further measures that could be taken in this regard, the Soviet government has come to the conclusion that existing conditions make it possible for us to take important and far-reaching steps in developing trade relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, so that both countries can obtain great benefits and promote universal peace.

There is no need to talk much about the benefits of developing economic ties between countries, especially trade ties. The importance of this connection is obvious, and both the national leaders of the Soviet Union and the national leaders of the United States have emphasized this importance more than once. For example, we still remember the words of the late US Secretary of State Cordell Hull, who said: "Trade and intercourse can become the antidote to war." I think you will agree that the world needs this antidote now more than ever.

Extensive trade between the Soviet Union and the United States is not new to our two countries. It should be known that there was a period when mutually beneficial economic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States developed extremely smoothly. However, in the past ten years, trade between the Soviet Union and the United States has not only failed to develop further, but has been reduced to a negligible level, and the responsibility for this does not lie with the Soviet Union. Now the United States is the only major country that has not signed a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The individual trade contracts signed by American companies with Soviet foreign trade organizations are extremely insignificant and cannot at all meet the economic potential of the two countries.

We believe that the time has come for the Soviet and American governments to take concerted action to broadly develop and normalize Soviet-American trade relations. Such actions by our two governments would be in the mutual interest of both countries and would be welcomed by the people of both countries.

Based on the sincere desire to improve relations between our two countries, the Soviet government proposes that the US government jointly take resolute measures to expand trade.

As the two most economically powerful countries, the Soviet Union and the United States have the potential to conduct extensive trade. In the past ten years, the US production institutions have greatly expanded. Of course, American businessmen are concerned about vigorously expanding foreign trade. At the same time, the Soviet Union, which has reached a modern and high level of economic development, now has far greater possibilities and resources than before to trade with other countries, including the United States.

Mr. President, I would like to specifically emphasize that the Soviet government's proposal to expand Soviet-American trade does not refer to arms or equipment for military production.

The Soviet Union is now implementing a new and extensive plan to further increase the production of daily necessities. In addition to increasing the production of natural raw materials, this plan also stipulates a substantial increase in the production of synthetic materials - fibers, plastics, leather, fur, and products made from these materials. This plan is only for peaceful purposes, and it aims to further improve the welfare of residents.

The Soviet Union has all the conditions and resources to successfully implement the above plan. However, in order to accelerate the implementation of this plan, the Soviet government can purchase a large number of relevant equipment and materials from the United States. In this way, the United States will be able to increase the operating rate of its industrial enterprises and the employment rate of residents, while the Soviet Union will be able to more quickly realize the production plan for consumer goods.

The Soviet government believes that our two countries' cooperation in the production of synthetic materials and their products can develop in the following directions:

	The Soviet Union purchases industrial equipment from the United States, including complete sets of equipment for entire factories;
	Sign contracts with American companies for the following: obtain licenses in individual cases, invite American experts to work as consultants in Soviet enterprises on the production of certain synthetic materials, and Soviet experts learn about the production of these materials and their products. The Soviet side is prepared to provide American experts with the opportunity to understand the achievements of the Soviet Union in this regard;
	Organize meetings between American and Soviet scientists and experts to discuss the production of synthetic materials, organize exhibitions of samples of synthetic materials and their products, etc.;
	Soviet scientists participate in the work of American scientific research institutions, and American scientists participate in the work of Soviet scientific research institutions, in order to exchange experience, jointly study new synthetic materials and formulate technological regulations.

At the same time, the Soviet Union can propose to the United States a broad plan for ordering the production of consumer goods and other equipment needed for housing and public utilities construction. Orders can include refrigeration equipment, air conditioning equipment, fiber papermaking and wood processing equipment, textile, footwear and food industry equipment, television equipment, equipment for the production of packaging materials, automatic machines for packaging and trade, pumps and compressors, mining processing machinery, machinery for the production of building materials and mechanization of construction, lifting and transportation and other equipment.

In addition, a large number of industrial materials and manufactured products can also be ordered, including black metal rolled products, gas pipes for urban gasification, various chemical products, medical equipment and medicines, and certain consumer goods.

The Soviet government believes that, based on corresponding agreements between the two parties, the equipment and various materials purchased in the United States in recent years may reach tens of billions of US dollars.

Naturally, the question arises of clearing accounts for such a large number of American goods purchased. The Soviet Union can supply the United States with Soviet goods that are of interest to them as payment, including: manganese ore, chromium ore, ferroalloys, platinum, palladium, asbestos, potash, wood, fiber, paper, certain chemical products, fur and other goods. If American companies are interested, the Soviet Union can also consider developing iron ore mining to supply the United States. At the same time, the Soviet Union can also provide the United States with a number of modern machines and equipment that American companies may be interested in.

We understand that due to the interruption of trade ties between our two countries, American companies will have certain difficulties in resuming large-scale purchases of Soviet goods in a short period of time. For this reason, a certain amount of time is obviously needed. On the other hand, American companies are now interested in receiving orders. If this is the case, then we can purchase more American goods and sell less of our own goods in the first few years.

To this end, the question arises of possible installment payments and long-term loans under normal conditions.

Of course, trade can begin to develop on the basis of mutual supply, but due to the above circumstances, loans and installment payments will create conditions for the United States to immediately receive a larger number of Soviet orders and purchases.

It is very clear that in order to arrange Soviet-American trade, it is necessary to establish the necessary contractual legal basis. The issue of establishing this basis, as well as the issue of implementing the plan for purchasing American goods and providing Soviet goods and clearing accounts between the two parties, can be discussed by the two governments if the US government agrees. Reaching an agreement on these issues will create favorable conditions for extensive trade transactions between relevant institutions in the United States and the Soviet Union.

We also believe that the smooth development of Soviet-American trade will be a genuine contribution to the universal activation of international trade. This will be a good example for the normalization and expansion of economic relations between other countries. Everyone will benefit from this development of the situation, including the United States, which will not only be able to obtain a large number of favorable orders from the Soviet Union, but also from many other countries.

Mr. President, this is the Soviet government's consideration of the possibility of developing trade between the United States and the Soviet Union. We hope that the US government will treat the suggestions made in this letter with due attention. The successful resolution of the Soviet-American trade issue will also be an important step in bringing our two countries closer together.

With sincere respect,
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union
N. Khrushchev

### 就发展苏美两国贸易关系问题  赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信

    就发展苏美两国贸易关系问题 
    赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的信
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日电：6月3日苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫把苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的一封信交给美国国务院转交艾森豪威尔总统。
    这封信的全文已经在6月6日的“真理报”上发表。信件的全文如下：尊敬的总统先生：
    我给您写这封信，是为了再一次涉及一个问题，关于这个问题最近期间我们两国政府间已经交换了某些意见，而苏联政府认为它有十分重要的意义，这就是关于改善和发展苏美关系的途径问题。照我看来，应当认为解决这个问题的可能性是很大的，而且直到目前为止还没有很好地加以利用。
    不久以前所签定的苏美文化、技术和教育交流协定，我们认为就是使得我们相互接近的很好的实际步骤。我们高兴地看到，这个协定的签定受到苏联、美国和其他各国广大社会阶层人士的拥护。我想，它之所以受到这样欢迎，首先是因为，各国人民认为这个协定具体地证明了苏美关系是可以真正改善的，并且使人产生一个希望：当前不稳定的和令人不安的国际局势也可能有总的改善。
    如果我们想要不辜负千千万万人的这些希望，我们就应当共同努力通过和平协商来解决迫切的共同的国际问题——我们相信苏联所建议的国家领导人的高级会议有助于此；同时也要共同致力于发展苏联同美国的直接关系。
    苏联政府周密地考虑了这方面可能采取的进一步措施后得出一个结论：现有条件使我们有可能在发展苏美两国间的贸易关系方面采取重要的、意义深远的步骤，使两国都能够获得巨大利益并促进普遍和平。
    没有必要去多谈发展国与国之间的经济联系、首先是贸易联系的好处。这种联系的重要意义是明显的，不论是苏联的国家领导人还是美国的国家领导人都不止一次地强调指出过这种意义。例如，我们还记得已故的美国国务卿科德尔·赫尔的话，他说：“贸易和交往可以成为战争的抗毒素。”我想，您会同意，世界现在比以前任何时候都更需要这种抗毒素。
    苏联同美国广泛地进行贸易对我们两国来说并不是新事情。要知道曾经有过一段时期，苏美双方互利的经济关系发展得极为顺利。可是最近十年来，苏联和美国的贸易不仅没有得到进一步的发展，反而已经缩减到微乎其微的地步，而这个责任不在苏联。现在美国是唯一没有同苏联签订贸易协定的大国。美国公司同苏联对外贸易组织所签订的个别的一些贸易合同是极其微不足道的，而且丝毫不能符合两国的经济潜力。
    我们认为，苏联和美国政府采取一致的行动来广泛发展苏美贸易关系并使其正常化，这样的时间已经来到了，而我们两国政府的这种行动会符合两国间的相互利益，并且会受到我们两国人民的欢迎。
    苏联政府本着改善我们两国关系的真诚愿望，建议美国政府共同采取坚决措施来扩展贸易。
    苏联和美国作为两个经济实力最雄厚的国家，有可能进行广泛的贸易。最近十年来，美国的生产机构大大扩展了，当然，美国的商界人士是关心大力扩大对外贸易的。同时，在经济上达到现代化高度水平的苏联，现在拥有较以前大得无比的可能性和资源来同其他国家、其中包括同美国进行贸易。
    总统先生，我想特别强调指出，苏联政府提出扩大苏美贸易的建议，决不是指军火或是供军事生产用的设备。
    苏联现在正在实现进一步提高日用品生产的新的广泛计划。除增加天然原料产品外，这个计划还规定大大增产合成物质——纤维、塑料、皮革、皮毛以及这些物质的制品。这个计划只是为了和平的目的，它以进一步提高居民的福利为目标。
    苏联有一切条件和资源来胜利执行上述计划。但是，苏联政府为了加速这个计划的实现，可以向美国大量购买有关的设备和材料。这样一来，美国就有可能提高自己工业企业的开工率和居民的就业率，而苏联就能够更加迅速地实现消费品的生产计划。
    苏联政府认为，我们两国在生产合成物质及其制品方面的合作可以按照下列方向发展：
    苏联向美国购买工业设备，其中包括整个工厂的全套设备；
    同美国公司签订下列合同：在个别情况下获得特许证、邀请美国专家来苏联企业担负生产某些合成物质问题的顾问工作、苏联专家了解这些物质及其制品的生产。苏联方面准备给美国专家提供了解苏联这方面成就的机会；
    组织美苏科学家和专家会见来讨论生产合成物质的问题，组织合成物质及其制品样品展览会等；
    苏联科学家参加美国科学研究机构的工作，美国科学家参加苏联科学研究机构的工作，以便交流经验，共同研究新的合成物质和制定工艺规程。
    同时，苏联可以向美国提出订购生产消费品以及住房和公用事业建设所需要的其他设备的广泛计划，订货可以包括冷藏设备、调节空气装置、纤维造纸业和木材加工业设备、纺织业、皮鞋业和食品工业的设备、电视设备、生产包装材料的设备、包装和贸易的自动机器、泵浦和压缩机、矿业加工业机器、生产建筑材料和使建筑机械化的机器、起重运输及其他设备。
    此外，还可以大量订购一系列工业物资和制成品，其中包括黑色金属轧材、城市煤气化的煤气管、各种化学制品、医疗设备和药品以及某些消费品。
    苏联政府认为，根据双方相应的协议在美国购买的设备和各种物资在最近一些年内可能达到数十亿美元。
    自然，产生一个对如此大量购买的美国商品清账的问题。苏联可以供给美国所感到兴趣的苏联商品来作为偿付，这些商品包括：锰矿、铬矿、铁合金、铂、钯、石棉、钾盐、木材、纤维、纸张、某些化学产品、毛皮和其他商品。如果美国公司感兴趣，苏联还可以考虑发展铁矿开采量以供应美国的问题。同时，苏联还可以向美国提供美国公司可能感到兴趣的若干现代机器和装备。
    我们明白，由于我们两国贸易联系的中断，美国公司在短时期内重新大规模购买苏联商品是有一定的困难的。为此，显然需要一定时间。从另一方面讲，美国公司方面现在就对得到定货感到兴趣。如果是这样的话，那么我们可以在最初几年多购买美国的货物而少出售自己的货物。
    为此，其中就产生根据正常条件可能分期付款和提供长期贷款的问题。
    当然，可以在相互供应的基础上开始发展贸易，但是由于上述情况，贷款和分期付款会创造条件，使美国立即就得到更大量的苏联订货和购货。
    很显然，为了安排苏美贸易，就需要建立必要的合同法律基础。关于建立这种基础的问题，以及关于实现购买美国商品和提供苏联商品的计划和双方清账的问题，如果美国政府同意，就可以由两国政府会商。在这些问题上达成协议，就会为美国和苏联两国的有关机构间的广泛贸易交易创造有利条件。
    我们还认为，顺利发展苏美贸易在普遍活跃国际贸易方面将是一个真正的贡献。这对其他国家经济关系的正常化和扩大将是一个很好的范例。大家都会从事态的这种发展中得到好处，其中包括美国，它不仅能从苏联，而且也能够从许多其他国家获得大量有利的订货。
    总统先生，苏联政府关于发展美国和苏联之间贸易的可能性的考虑就是这样。我们希望美国政府以应有的注意对待这封信中所提出的建议。圆满解决苏美贸易问题，在我们两国相互接近方面也将是一个重要步骤。
    致真挚的敬意
    				苏联部长会议主席		 			                   尼·赫鲁晓夫
