Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st. At a press conference on May 31st, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Ung Van Khiem distributed the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of the continued retention of the International Commission for Laos, and also answered some questions raised by reporters.

Ung Van Khiem said that although peace in Indochina has been maintained under many difficult circumstances in the past four years, the situation in South Vietnam is unstable due to the US imperialists' actions in strengthening military equipment in South Vietnam, illegally transporting military personnel and military materials into South Vietnam, and attempting to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. The cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam is suffering serious threats. In Laos, thanks to the goodwill of the Lao Royal Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and thanks to the active efforts of the International Commission for Laos, the situation in Laos has improved recently, such as the realization of national harmony and national unity, the establishment of a coalition government, and the holding of supplementary elections. However, due to the conspiracy of US imperialism, the situation in Laos is not completely normal, which is related to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and causes them common concern.

Ung Van Khiem pointed out that peace in Indochina is indivisible. In this case, it is very necessary to continue to retain the International Commission for Laos. The existence of the International Commission for Laos has an extremely important role: it will strictly supervise and monitor the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Agreement on political issues in Laos, and especially it will supervise and monitor Articles 6, 7, and 9 of the Geneva Accords on the Lao Question, which prohibit the entry of troops, military personnel, weapons, and ammunition into Laos, and prevent the US interference in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a military base and drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

Ung Van Khiem emphasized that if the International Commission for Laos ceases its activities, it is a violation of the spirit and provisions of the Geneva Agreements.

    越南外交部副部长雍文谦指出 
    必须保留老挝国际委员会
    以制止美国干涉老挝的阴谋
    新华社河内1日电　越南民主共和国外交部副部长雍文谦，5月31日在记者招待会上分发越南民主共和国政府就老挝国际委员会必须继续保留的问题的声明同时，还回答了记者们提出的一些问题。
    雍文谦说，四年来，印度支那的和平虽然能够在许多困难情况下维持下来，但是，由于美帝国主义在南越加强军事装备、把军事人员和军事物资非法运进南越、企图把南越拉入东南亚侵略集团等行动，南越的局势不稳定。和平统一越南的事业正在遭受严重威胁。在老挝，由于老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队的善意，由于老挝国际委员会的积极努力，老挝最近一个时期的局势有了好转，例如实现了民族的和睦的国家的统一，成立了联合政府，举行了补充选举。但是由于美帝国主义的阴谋活动，老挝的局势还不是完全正常，这是同老挝、柬埔寨、越南三国有关，并且为他们共同感到忧虑的事情。
    雍文谦指出，印度支那的和平是不能割裂的。在这种情况下，老挝国际委员会非常有必要继续保留。老挝国际委员会的存在具有极其重要的作用：它将严格地监督和监察日内瓦协议关于老挝的政治问题的条款的执行，而且特别重要的是它将监督和监察日内瓦会议关于老挝问题的协定第六、第七和第九条关于禁止把军队、军事人员、武器和弹药进入老挝的条款的执行，制止美国干涉老挝、企图变老挝为军事基地和把老挝拖入东南亚侵略集团的阴谋。
    雍文谦强调指出，如果老挝国际委员会停止活动，这是违反日内瓦会议各项协定的精神和条文的。
