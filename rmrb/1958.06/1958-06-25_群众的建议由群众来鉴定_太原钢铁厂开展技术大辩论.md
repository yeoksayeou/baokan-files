    The Masses' Suggestions Judged by the Masses:
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Launches Technical Debates
    (Our reporter Ma Ming reports) Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, in its technical innovation campaign, is employing mass technical debates to process the growing number of technical innovation suggestions made by its workers.
    The plant’s technical debate campaign unfolded following the deepening of the technical innovation movement. In May, the plant's technical innovation movement flourished, with workers submitting over 35,000 technical innovation proposals. Many workers drew diagrams of equipment, tool, and operational method improvements on big-character posters, accompanied by detailed written explanations. These technical reform suggestions were inextricably linked to solving the key production issues for achieving this year's Great Leap Forward plan. This urgent desire among the workers to realize a technical revolution prompted the leadership to consider that the processing of rationalization proposals and technical reforms in the Great Leap Forward could no longer be handled slowly. The power to process rationalization suggestions and technical reforms, with the exception of some major technical issues, should be delegated to the work sections. Following this change, many grassroots units established technical innovation committees and technical innovation teams. After conducting preliminary research on the technical innovation suggestions put forward by the workers, they selected technical topics requiring debate and convened technical debate meetings to mobilize the masses to discuss them.
    Looking at the 209 larger technical topics debated across the plant recently, over 3,000 people participated. The format of the technical debate meetings generally falls into three categories: first, specialized debates on significant technical reform proposals are hosted by the technical innovation committees of middle-level production units, with the participation of relevant management cadres, technicians, and both new and veteran workers; second, the leadership proposes technical topics related to the shared needs of various units and crucial to fulfilling this year's production targets, initiating debates among all workers; third, grassroots production teams adopt a "propose, discuss, and solve" approach to promptly address the numerous daily operational methods and small tool reform suggestions put forward by workers within their respective units.
    The topics of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's technical debate meetings largely involve modifications to technical management systems and operational procedures, as well as improvements to equipment and tools. Moreover, there are often several different plans and opinions on a single technical reform. Holding technical debate meetings, where collective wisdom is gathered, is an excellent method for relying on the masses to carefully address these complex technical problems both quickly and effectively. For example, the Thin Plate Department previously had two slab heating furnaces, each supplying one rolling mill. To ensure increased production of silicon steel sheets, urgently needed nationwide, without increasing or minimally increasing the number of slab heating furnaces after adding rolling mills, workers and technicians submitted over 20 suggestions. After debate, accounting, and comparison, it was determined that simply extending the original slab heating furnace by one meter and adding some temporary, simple equipment could increase silicon steel sheet production by 30%. This debate also criticized those viewpoints that pursued increased automation equipment and demanded massive state investment.
    Many technical reform suggestions, after being evaluated through mass debates, not only implemented the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but also fully promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers in realizing technical reforms during the discussions, providing a solid mass foundation for the realization of the production leap forward plan. After discussing proposals to strengthen equipment maintenance and extend maintenance time, the workers of the six-ton furnace in the Power Department changed the past phenomenon where maintenance personnel were overwhelmed during six-ton furnace maintenance, while operations personnel had nothing to do. Operations personnel proposed that they should learn multiple skills and actively participate in maintenance work in the future. Through technical debates, workers also gained knowledge of many scientific and technical principles and became enthusiastic about mastering new operating techniques, changing the previous phenomenon where some technical reforms were only tested by a few technicians.
    Technical debate meetings have also enabled the plant's leadership at all levels to discover many unexpected and valuable technical reform suggestions, which are being gradually studied and tested and will be included in the plant's technical measures for achieving the leap forward plan and implemented.

### 群众的建议由群众来鉴定  太原钢铁厂开展技术大辩论

    群众的建议由群众来鉴定
    太原钢铁厂开展技术大辩论
    本报讯　记者马明报道：太原钢铁厂在技术革新运动中，采取群众性的技术大辩论，处理广大职工提出的越来越多的技术革新建议。
    这个厂的技术大辩论，是在技术革新运动深入开展以后展开的。5月份，这个厂的技术革新运动蓬勃开展，职工们提出了三万五千多项技术革新建议。许多工人在大字报上绘画改进设备、工具和操作方法的图样，并且有详细的文字说明。这些技术改革的建议和解决实现今年跃进计划的生产关键是休戚相关的。广大职工这种为实现技术革命的迫切心情，促使领导上考虑到，目前已经不能慢腾腾地处理大跃进中的技术改革合理化建议了。把处理合理化建议和技术改革的权力，除了一些重大的技术问题以外，应该下放到工段。这样做以后，许多基层单位成立了技术革新委员会和技术革新小组。他们对职工提出的技术革新建议在进行初步的研究以后，从这些建议中再挑选需要辩论的技术课题，分别召开技术辩论会，发动职工群众讨论。
    从最近全厂经过辩论的二百零九个较大的技术课题来看，参加辩论的人达三千人以上，技术辩论会的形式，大体分三种类型：第一是由中层生产单位的技术革新委员会主持，吸收有关管理干部、技术人员和新老工人参加对某一项较大的技术改革建议的专题辩论；第二种是由领导上根据完成今年生产任务的需要和遇到的技术问题，提出关系到各个单位之间共同性的技术课题，发动全体职工展开辩论；第三种是以基层生产小组为单位，对本单位职工提出的大量日常具体操作方法和小工具改革建议，采取“边提出、边讨论、边解决”的办法随时加以处理。
    太原钢铁厂技术辩论会的课题，绝大部分涉及到对技术管理制度、工艺规程的修改和对设备、工具的改进，而且往往在一项技术改革上存在有几种不同的方案和见解。召开技术辩论会，可以集思广益，是依靠职工群众又快又好地慎重处理这些复杂的技术问题的良好办法。如薄板部过去有两个板坯加热炉，每个炉供应一个轧机使用，为了保证增加轧机后在不增加或少增加板坯加热炉的情况下增产全国急需的硅钢片，工人和技术人员提出了二十多种建议。经过争辩、算账、比较，确定只要把原来的板坯加热炉延长一公尺，另增加一些临时的简易设备，便可以提高硅钢片产量30％。在这次辩论中并且批判了那些追求增加自动化设备、要求国家增加巨额投资的观点。
    许多技术改革建议，经过群众性的辩论鉴定后，不仅贯彻执行了多快好省建设社会主义的方针，而且在讨论中充分发扬了职工群众对实现改革技术的积极性和创造性，使生产跃进计划的实现也有了雄厚的群众基础。动力部六吨炉工人在讨论加强设备养护延长检修时间的建议以后，改变了过去六吨炉检修时检修人员忙不过来，而运行人员却没有事干的现象。运行人员提出今后要学习多种技术，积极参加检修工作。经过技术辩论，还使工人们增长了许多科学技术原理知识，并且使工人热心掌握新的操作技术，改变了过去有些技术改革仅由少数技术人员试验的现象。
    技术辩论会又使这个厂的各级领导部门发现了许多预想不到的宝贵技术改革建议，正在逐步研究试验，并将列入全厂实现跃进计划的技术措施以内付诸实现。
