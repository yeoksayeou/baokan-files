　　The History of the Cart
　　Wang Xieshan
    Currently, "cartification" has become a resounding slogan in China's agricultural technological revolution. Using carts to replace manpower can reduce farmers' physical labor and improve work efficiency. In fact, the country that invented the cart earliest in the world was China. About 4,500 to 3,500 years ago, our ancestors invented the cart. It is said that at that time, people were inspired by "seeing the tumbleweed turn and knowing it could be a cart" ("Huainanzi"). "Tumbleweed" is a kind of grass that turns when blown by the wind, thus giving people inspiration and leading them to associate it with the needs of production at the time, thereby inventing the cart.
    Pottery from the Xia Dynasty already has patterns of cart wheels painted on it. From the models of carts unearthed from Yin Ruins (1400 to 1100 BC) and the records on oracle bones, it can be seen that carts were already very well-developed at that time; spoked wheels were already being used to replace 辁 (wheels without spokes).
    By the Zhou Dynasty, the types and styles of carts had increased a lot, including the "yu" pulled by animals; the "nian" pushed by manpower; military vehicles specially used for combat; agricultural vehicles specially used for farming; and road vehicles used by nobles.
    During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, due to the widespread use of metals such as copper and iron, copper or iron bearings (called "gang") began to be used on carts to replace those made of wood. During this period, animal oil was already used as a lubricant for mechanical parts.
    The adoption of spokes, metal bearings, and the application of lubricants were the most advanced technologies in the world at that time.
    Due to the high development and division of labor of handicraft industry, and due to the accumulation of rich experience, research on the design and manufacturing process of carts began to appear in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. There is a passage in Mozi's "Lu Wen" chapter that says: "...Mozi said to Gongshuzi: 'Your 鲁? is not as good as 翟's axle, which can bear the weight of fifty "shi" with three inches of wood in a short time.'..." The axle is a part that connects the wheel and the axle of the cart; the axle made of three inches of wood can bear a heavy load of fifty "shi." This is a formula summarized by the great scientist Mozi after the experience of many craftsmen. This empirical formula can be said to be the first empirical formula for strength in the history of mechanical design. It is of great significance in the history of cart design and component design. In the "Kaogong Ji," which is slightly later than the book "Mozi," a large part of it is about the design and manufacturing technology of carts, and there are detailed descriptions of the design and production of wheels, axles, spokes, carriages, and other parts. This is China's and the world's first specialized book on cart design.
    Carts originally had two wheels. The invention of the unicycle was another step forward in the development of the cart. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang invented the "wooden ox and flowing horse" during the Three Kingdoms period. "Wooden ox" and "flowing horse" may be a special kind of unicycle. To this day, unicycles are still commonly used in rural areas. What is called "Jigong cart" in Sichuan and "Yangjiao cart" in Jiangnan. According to the research of the British "Nature" magazine, unicycles and sailing carts were once introduced to the West from China in ancient times.
    Carts equipped with special machinery were also invented earliest in China. The south-pointing chariot and the mile-recording drum cart of the Han Dynasty are this type of cart.
    In the more than one thousand years since then, because it has never gotten rid of using manpower or animal power as the prime mover, the structure and form of this means of transportation, the cart, has hardly undergone any major innovations.
    The history of using natural energy to propel carts, allowing them to break away from their primitive state, is less than one hundred and fifty years. In 1813, the Englishman Stevenson invented the train using Watt's steam engine, bringing the cart into a new historical stage. In 1882, the Russians Putilov and Hlopov made a kind of cart equipped with a gasoline engine—the automobile. However, these modern carts still need people to drive and operate them.
    Recently, "automatic trains" and "automatic automobiles" have been successfully tested in the Soviet Union. The emergence of these carts, which are completely controlled by automatic devices, will bring this means of transportation, the cart, into a new era of complete automation. (Attached picture)

　　车的历史
　　王燮山
    目前，“车子化”已成为我国农业技术革新中的一个响亮口号。用车子代替人力，可以减轻农民的体力劳动，可以提高工作效率。其实，世界上最早发明车的国家就是我国。大约在距今四千五百到三千五百年前，我们的祖先就发明了车。据说，那时候人们因“见飞蓬转而知为车”（“淮南子”）。“飞蓬”是一种草，当它被风吹动时就转动，因此给人们一种启发，联想到当时生产上的需要，发明了车子。
    夏代的陶器上，已画有车轮的花纹。从殷墟（公元前一千四百到一千一百年）出土的车的模型和甲骨文的记载，可以看出车在那时已很完善；那时已经采用有辐条的车轮来代替辁（无辐条车轮）。
    到了周代，车的种类和型式增加很多，有用兽力拉的舆；有用人力推的辇；有专门用来作战的兵车；有专门用在农事上的田车；还有贵族所用的路车。
    春秋战国时代，由于铜、铁等金属的广泛使用，在车上也开始采用铜或铁制的轴承（叫做釭）以代替木头作的。在这个时期中，已采用动物油来作机件的润滑剂。
    辐条的采用、金属轴承和润滑剂的应用，在当时都是世界上最先进的技术。
    由于手工业的高度发展和分工，由于丰富的经验积累，春秋战国时代已开始出现有关车的设计和制作工艺的研究。墨子“鲁问”篇上有一段话说：“……子墨子谓公输子曰：‘子之为?也，不如翟之为车辖，须臾（刘）斲三寸之木而任五十石之重’。……”辖是联接车轮和车轴的一个零件；用三寸之木作成的车辖，能承担五十石的重载，这是经过多少工匠的经验，才由墨子这位伟大科学家总结得到这样一个公式。这个经验公式，在机械设计史上，可以说是第一个强度经验公式。在车的设计和机件设计史上，都具有莫大的意义。比“墨子”这本书稍后的“考工记”上，其中有很大一部分是有关车的设计和制造工艺的，对于轮、轴、辐、车厢等各部分的设计和制作都有详细的记述。这是我国和世界的第一部有关车的设计的专门著作。
    车在最初都是两个轮子的，独轮车的发明在车的发展上又进了一步。传说三国时，诸葛亮发明了“木牛流马”。“木牛”和“流马”可能就是一种特殊的独轮车。至今，乡间仍普遍使用独轮车。四川称为“鸡公车”，江南叫做“羊角车”的便是。据英国“自然”杂志的考证，独轮车和有帆车在古代曾由中国传入西方。
    装有特殊机械的车子，也是由中国最早发明的。汉代的指南车和记里鼓车，就是这种类型的车子。
    在这以后的一千多年，由于一直没有摆脱使用人力或兽力作为原动力，所以车这种交通工具在结构上和形式上几乎没有重大的革新。
    利用自然界的能量来推动车，使车脱离原始状态的历史还不到一百五十年。1813年，英国人史蒂文生利用瓦特的蒸汽机发明了火车，使车进入了一个新的历史阶段。1882年，俄国人普契洛夫、赫洛波夫制成了一种装有汽油发动机的车子——汽车。可是这些近代化的车子仍旧需要人来驾驶和操纵。
    最近，“自动火车”、“自动汽车”已在苏联试验成功。这些完全由自动装置操纵的车子的出现，将使车子这种交通工具进入完全自动化的新世纪。（附图片）
