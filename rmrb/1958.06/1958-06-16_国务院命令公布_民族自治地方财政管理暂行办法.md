Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The 97th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has approved in principle the "Provisional Measures for Financial Management in National Autonomous Areas." These measures have been promulgated by order of the State Council on June 13, 1958, and are to be implemented from 1958 onwards. This is a major improvement in the financial management system of our country's national autonomous areas and is an important link in implementing the national policy. The promulgation and implementation of these measures will further enhance the initiative and enthusiasm of the national autonomous areas in managing their finances, in order to adapt to the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, central industry and local industry, and large and small enterprises, to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. The main content of the measures is to delineate the scope of financial revenue and expenditure of the national autonomous areas and expand their financial management authority, so as to take into account the characteristics and needs of the national autonomous areas. The main points of these measures are as follows:

    (1) The financial revenue of national autonomous regions includes the income from existing local enterprises, income from local undertakings, seven types of local taxes (stamp tax, interest income tax, slaughter tax, livestock transaction tax, urban real estate tax, cultural and entertainment tax, vehicle and vessel usage license tax), income from central enterprises designated for revenue sharing with the local areas, and various miscellaneous local income. In addition to these revenues, the entire income from commodity circulation tax, goods tax, business tax, income tax, agricultural tax, animal husbandry tax, and salt tax will also be allocated to the autonomous regions as their revenue. In general provinces and cities, these revenues are used as central government's adjustment and sharing income to the local areas. For autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties, more revenue items are also allocated as local income compared to general special districts and counties. The purpose of this is to enable these areas to have a larger scope of financial flexibility and to better arrange their local revenue and expenditure.

    (2) The financial expenditure of national autonomous areas includes all economic construction expenditures of the national autonomous areas, such as expenditures on industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, post and telecommunications, commerce, salt industry, and urban construction, all social, cultural, and educational expenditures, such as appropriations for culture, education, science, communications, broadcasting, sports, health, preferential treatment, and relief, as well as administrative management expenditures of the national autonomous areas.

    The aforementioned financial expenditures, including the autonomous region's capital construction investment, are different from the general provinces and cities where capital construction investment is specifically appropriated by the central government. Therefore, the scope of financial expenditure of the national autonomous areas is also larger than that of general provinces and cities.

    (3) After the scope of financial revenue and expenditure of the national autonomous areas is divided according to the above items, the portion of revenue exceeding expenditure will be subjected to a fixed quota to be remitted to the higher level, fixed for five years. Within the five years, all the increased income due to economic development will belong to the local areas. After the scope of financial revenue and expenditure is divided according to the above items, if the revenue is less than the expenditure, the higher level will allocate subsidies. The amount of subsidies from the higher level will be adjusted annually according to the needs of the development and expansion of the construction undertakings in the national autonomous areas. The above practice can enable the national autonomous areas to have more revenue and more expenditure on the basis of production development, which is conducive to expanding the sources of income of the local areas and comprehensively arranging the development of the local economic construction and cultural construction undertakings.

    (4) If the budget of the national autonomous areas encounters major disasters during the implementation process, the higher-level authorities can allocate funds for relief. In addition, for new undertakings designated by the higher-level authorities or construction projects proposed by the local authorities and approved by the higher-level authorities, the higher-level authorities will also allocate subsidies.

    (5) In order to adapt to the economic and cultural development of autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties, the central government can appropriately increase their base figures when calculating the expenditure base figures for the provinces that govern autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties. That is, in addition to the total expenditure of the entire province, the total expenditure of the autonomous prefectures can be increased by 7% to 8%, and the total expenditure of the autonomous counties can be increased by 4% to 5%. This will be conducive to the provinces making necessary considerations for the special needs of the autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties.

    (6) In terms of tax management, the national autonomous areas are also given more flexibility in handling matters. When implementing national tax laws, the autonomous organs of the national autonomous areas may reduce or exempt taxes for certain matters that require tax considerations or incentives. When necessary, they can also formulate local tax measures based on the basic principles of tax law and in combination with the specific conditions and ethnic characteristics of the local areas.

    In addition, the measures also stipulate that the autonomous organs of the national autonomous areas should strengthen financial management, gradually improve the financial system, and earnestly cultivate ethnic cadres who manage local finances. The higher-level authorities should also regularly understand the financial management situation of the national autonomous areas and provide necessary assistance and supervision.

### 国务院命令公布  民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法

    国务院命令公布
    民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法
      新华社13日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十七次会议原则批准了“民族自治地方财政管理暂行办法”。这个办法已经由国务院于1958年6月13日命令发布，确定自1958年起开始实行。这是我国民族自治地方财政管理制度上的一项重大改进，是贯彻执行民族政策的重要环节之一。这个办法的发布和实行，将进一步发挥各民族自治地方管理财政的主动性和积极性，以适应工业和农业、中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，多快好省地建设社会主义。办法的主要内容是：划分民族自治地方的财政收支范围，扩大他们的财政管理权限，以照顾民族自治地方的特点和需要。这个办法的要点如下：
    （一）民族自治区的财政收入，包括原有地方企业的收入、地方事业收入、七种地方税收（印花税、利息所得税、屠宰税、牲畜交易税、城市房地产税、文化娱乐税、车船使用牌照税）、中央指定与地方实行分成的中央企业的收入和地方各种零星收入。除了这些收入以外，还将商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税、农业税、牧业税、盐税等收入全部划给自治区，作为自治区的收入，而这些收入在一般省市是作为中央对地方的调剂分成收入的。对自治州、自治县，也比一般专区和县划给较多的收入项目，作为地方收入。这样做的目的，是为了使这些地方的财政能够有较大的机动范围，能够更好地安排本地区的收支。
    （二）民族自治地方的财政支出，包括民族自治地方的全部经济建设支出如工业、农、林、水利、交通、邮电、商业、盐业、城市建设等支出，全部社会文教支出如文化、教育、科学、通讯、广播、体育、卫生、优抚、救济等拨款，以及民族自治地方的行政管理支出。
    上述财政支出，包括自治区的基本建设投资在内，这和一般省市的基本建设投资由中央专案拨款是有不同的。因此，民族自治地方财政支出的范围，也比一般省市要大一些。
    （三）民族自治地方的财政收入和支出的范围，按照上述项目划分以后，收多于支的部分，采取定额上解的办法，五年固定不变，五年以内，经济发展收入增多的部分全部归地方。按照上述项目划分以后，收少于支的，由上级拨款补助。上级补助的数额，按照民族自治地方建设事业发展和扩大的需要，每年予以变动。上述做法，可以使民族自治地方在生产发展的基础上，多收多支，有利于扩大本地方的收入来源，统筹安排本地方经济建设和文化建设事业的发展。
    （四）民族自治地方的预算，在执行过程中，如果遇到重大灾荒，可以由上级机关拨款救济。此外，凡由上级指定新办的事业或者由地方提出经过上级批准的建设项目，也由上级拨款补助。
    （五）为了适应自治州、自治县的经济和文化的发展，中央对辖有自治州、自治县的省，在计算支出基数的时候，可以适当地提高他们的基数，即是，在全省的支出总额以外，对自治州的支出总数增加7％至8％，对自治县的支出总数增加4％至5％。这样，就有利于省对自治州和自治县的某些特殊需要作必要的照顾。
    （六）在税收管理上，也给予民族自治地方较多的灵活处理的权限。民族自治地方的自治机关，在执行国家税法的时候，对于某些在税收上需要加以照顾或者奖励的，可以减税或者免税，并且在必要的时候，还可以根据税法的基本原则，结合本地方的具体情况和民族特点，制定本地方的税收办法。
    此外，办法中还规定了民族自治地方的自治机关应该加强财政管理，逐步健全财政制度，认真培养管理地方财政的民族干部。上级机关也要经常了解民族自治地方的财政管理情况，给予必要的帮助和监督。
