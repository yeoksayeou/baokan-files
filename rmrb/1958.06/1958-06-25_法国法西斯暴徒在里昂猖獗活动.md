Xinhua News Agency, June 24th dispatch from Paris: On the evening of the 22nd, Poujade, the leader of the political organization with fascist leanings, "Union for the Defense of Small Businessmen and Artisans," Antier, a right-wing member of the National Assembly, and Lefebvre, a representative of the Algerian "Committee of Public Safety," attempted to hold a rally of their partisans in Lyon. However, supporters of democratic republicanism in Lyon gathered to fight back against the fascists.

The police and the "Republican Security Forces" rushed to help Poujade and his accomplices. They used batons and tear gas to deal with the democratic republicans, resulting in seven people being injured. The police also brutally beat Beren, a journalist from the local democratic newspaper "République."

With the connivance of the police authorities, the ferocity of the fascist thugs grew increasingly rampant. On the same night they held their fascist rally, they attacked the office of a local organization of the Communist Party in Lyon, throwing a bottle of flammable mixture inside, causing a fire. However, the fire was quickly extinguished.

    法国法西斯暴徒在里昂猖獗活动
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：22日晚上，法西斯色彩浓厚的政治组织“保障小商人和手工业者联盟”领袖布热德、国民议会右翼议员安提埃和阿尔及利亚“救国委员会”代表勒菲弗尔企图在里昂举行他们的党羽的集会。但是，里昂拥护民主共和的人士集合起来回击法西斯分子。
    警察和“共和国保安部队”急忙赶来帮助布热德和他的同伙。他们用木棍和催泪弹来对付民主共和人士，结果有七人受了伤。警察还毒打了当地的民主报纸——“共和国报”的记者贝雷恩。
    在警察当局纵容下，法西斯暴徒的凶焰越来越高。他们在举行法西斯集会的同一天晚上袭击了共产党在里昂的一个地方组织的办事处，向里面扔掷了一瓶易燃的混合物，从而引起失火。但是火头很快就被扑灭了。
