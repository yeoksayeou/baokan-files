Editorial Note:

    Vigorously Establish "Satellite" Factories
    "Hens laying eggs" – old factories vigorously establishing "satellite" factories – is a good way to develop local industry more, faster, better, and more economically. This has once again been proven by the practice of the Fuzhou Match Factory.
    To achieve the goal of local industries blooming everywhere, there are many paths. Transferring personnel and starting from scratch is one path; upgrading handicraft cooperatives is one path; "Hens laying eggs" – old factories establishing "satellite" factories – is also one path. The "hens laying eggs" path can fully utilize the potential of old factories' equipment, capital, and technical strength. This is a relatively easy way to solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment and lack of technical personnel in the development of local industry.
    The Fujian Provincial Party Committee has called on all 1,800 old factories in the province to learn from the Fuzhou Match Factory's approach. All those with the conditions should work hard for a month to establish more "satellite" factories. This mobilization order has vigor and is in the style of "striving for the upstream." We wish Fujian Province victory in advance!

    大办“卫星”厂
    “母鸡下蛋”，老厂大办“卫星”厂，是多快好省地发展地方工业的一种好办法。这一点，为福州火柴厂的实践再一次证明了。
    要做到地方工业遍地开花，道路很多。调兵遣将平地起家，是一条路；手工业社升级是一条路；“母鸡下蛋”，老厂办“卫星”厂，也是一条路。而“母鸡下蛋”这条路，能够充分利用老厂的设备、资金、技术力量等潜力，对于发展地方工业中设备不足、技术人员缺乏等困难，都比较容易解决。
    福建省委号召全省一千八百个老厂学习福州火柴厂的做法，凡是有条件的，都要苦战一月，办起更多的“卫星”厂。这个动员令有气魄，是“力争上游”的风格。我们预祝福建省的胜利！
