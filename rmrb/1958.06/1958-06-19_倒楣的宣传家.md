    Unlucky Propagandists
    Since late January of this year, British newspapers have been constantly promoting to the world that Britain has completed a major scientific device - the "ZETA" equipment. It was said that this equipment could achieve a temperature of 5 million degrees Celsius and produce thermonuclear reactions, thus solving the problem of using thermonuclear energy for power generation. However, recently, a group of scientists from the renowned Harwell Atomic Research Establishment in Britain admitted in the journal "Nature" that the "ZETA" equipment did not actually produce a true thermonuclear reaction as initially claimed.

    Scientific setbacks and failures are unavoidable. What is unlucky are those British bourgeois propagandists who originally wanted to elevate Britain's status by hyping up this matter, and even wanted to "compensate" for Britain's backwardness in artificial satellites, but the result was a scandal. Now these propagandists have to dejectedly admit that this is a major blow to Britain's prestige. This lesson should make those unlucky propagandists a bit more honest!

    倒楣的宣传家
    今年1月下旬以来，英国报纸不断向全世界宣扬，英国已完成一项重大的科学装置——“泽塔”设备。据说利用这种设备可以达到摄氏五百万度的高温，产生热核子反应，也就能解决利用热核能发电的问题。但是，最近英国著名的哈威尔原子研究机构的一批科学家在“自然”杂志上承认：“泽塔”设备原来并没有像当初所说的那样产生真正的热核反应。
    科学上遭到挫折和失败是难免的。倒楣的是那些英国资产阶级的宣传家们，原想从对这一事情的大吹大擂来抬高英国的地位，甚至想“抵偿”英国在人造卫星方面的落后，但是结果却出了丑。现在这些宣传家不能不垂头丧气地承认：这对英国的威信是一个重大打击。这个教训应该使那些倒楣的宣传家们老实一点了吧！
