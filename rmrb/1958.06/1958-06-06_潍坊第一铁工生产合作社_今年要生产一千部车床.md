Weifang First Ironworkers Production Cooperative
To Produce One Thousand Lathes This Year

(Our dispatch) The Weifang First Ironworkers Production Cooperative in Shandong Province has successfully trial-produced a six-foot horizontal belt lathe using indigenous methods. They plan to produce one thousand lathes this year.

This cooperative originally produced Liberation-style waterwheels. This spring, due to the great development of local industry, the demand for lathes from industries and handicrafts in various counties and cities of the Changwei Special District became very urgent. The Industry Department of the Changwei Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Weifang Municipal Committee encouraged the Ironworkers First Cooperative to manufacture lathes, and provided assistance in various aspects, allowing them to break away from other tasks and concentrate their efforts on lathes. The cooperative members, having received such support and understanding the important role of lathe manufacturing in the development of local industry, mustered their energy and worked diligently to begin trial-producing this new product.

The transition from manufacturing waterwheels to manufacturing lathes presented many difficulties. They had no blueprints, nor a single technician from a professional school, and only two old and worn-out lathes as tools. However, the cooperative members were not intimidated by the difficulties. Old technician Zhao Defu used the old lathe as a sample, drawing each component; not understanding mathematics, he arranged the drawn blueprints together, comparing them to calculate the size; if that didn't work, he modified them during the trial production process. They worked hard like this for more than twenty days, finally completing the design.

They also lacked experience in construction, so they still used indigenous methods, advancing one step at a time. For example, no one in the cooperative understood how to mill helical gears, so Zhao Defu and Tan Xuxi, two old technicians, had to try it themselves. Neither of them understood trigonometry, so they followed a ready-made formula from a book they found, spending three days and three nights, and finally succeeded.

At the end of March, the first six-foot horizontal belt lathe was successfully trial-produced, and they immediately received orders from various county industrial bureaus and handicraft cooperatives. Therefore, they boldly proposed a plan to produce one thousand lathes throughout the year.

Currently, all cooperative members are continuing to make equipment themselves, launching a vigorous technical innovation movement. They will strive to produce five to seven lathes per day from July onwards, to ensure the realization of the annual production plan of one thousand units. (Xue Zhi)

    潍坊第一铁工生产合作社
    今年要生产一千部车床
    本报讯　山东省潍坊市第一铁工生产合作社用土办法试制成功六呎卧式皮带车床。他们计划在今年生产车床一千部。
    这个社本来是生产解放式水车的，今年春季由于地方工业大发展，昌潍专区各县市工业和手工业对车床的需要非常急迫，中共昌潍地委工业部和潍坊市委都鼓励铁工一社制造车床，并且在各方面给予帮助，让他们摆脱其他任务，集中力量搞车床。社员们得到这样的支持，又知道了制造车床对发展地方工业的重大作用，就鼓足干劲，狠干猛钻，开始试制这个新产品。
    由制造水车转到制造车床，困难是很多的。他们没有图纸，也没有一个从专业学校出来的技术人员，工具只有二台破旧的车床。但是，社员们没有被困难吓倒。老技工赵德富拿旧车床做样本，把各个部件绘下来；他不懂数学，就把绘下来的图纸摆在一起，比方比方， 计算大小；还不行，就在试制过程中边制边改。就这样硬干了二十多天，终于完成了设计。
    施工也没有经验，他们仍旧用土办法，摸到一步前进一步。如铣斜齿轮，全社没有一个懂得的人，只好由赵德富和谭绪西两个老技工自己试。他们两个人都不懂三角，照着找到的一本书上现成的公式，费了三天三夜，终于成功了。
    3月底，第一部六呎卧式皮带车床试制成功了，马上接到各县工业局和手工业联社订货的要求。于是，他们大胆提出了全年生产车床一千台的计划。
    现在，全体社员正在继续自制设备，掀起了热火朝天的技术革新运动。他们要争取从7月份起，日产车床五部到七部，保证实现全年生产一千部的计划。　（薛至）
