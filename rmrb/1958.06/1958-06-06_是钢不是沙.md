　　Steel, Not Sand
　　Yimo
    Sand and steel are fundamentally different. Even when comparing their attributes, they are polar opposites. Steel is a metal with extremely high density, hardness, and toughness, while sand cannot be bound together even with water. However, sometimes things with completely different attributes become confused in the minds of some people.
    For example, in the past, some "well-meaning" scholars, when the nation was being invaded from the outside and oppressed from within, always lamented that the Chinese people were like a heap of loose sand. As Lu Xun said, they "attributed the responsibility for misfortune to everyone." They forgot that even sand "is successfully managed by the rulers." Moreover, since ancient times, the common people have not been sand; there have been many popular uprisings and rebellions, uniting to deliver heavy blows to the reactionary rulers of the time.
    The people are steel, not sand. This is the truth of history. It was precisely because our great leader Chairman Mao had this historical materialist confidence in the masses of the people that he could discern the imminent arrival of the revolutionary high tide even in 1930, when it seemed to be at a low ebb: "It is a ship standing on the shore, looking out to sea, with the tip of its mast already visible; it is a round of morning sun standing on the summit of a high mountain, looking eastward, already visible with radiant light about to burst forth; it is a baby about to mature, restlessly moving in the womb." ("A single spark can start a prairie fire.")
    But now, when 600 million people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are building a new motherland with their iron will and have already achieved tremendous construction achievements, there are still some "ancient" gentlemen who are flipping through "old ledgers" in front of us, spreading arguments that lack confidence in our socialist construction cause. Among these ancient gentlemen, some only see our country's poverty and blankness. They are afraid of the vigorous Great Leap Forward. As long as there is a slight disturbance in the work, they shout and make a fuss, losing confidence; others, in the ocean of the mass Great Leap Forward, only see some negative dark spots in the work. Although they do not shout, they silently wait and see with fear, and therefore, they are hesitant and dare not boldly mobilize the masses.
    These ancient gentlemen are unwilling to believe that this poor and blank country can leap forward like a giant dragon, flying like a meteor; they dare not believe even more that a backward country that has been poor and blank for centuries can catch up with and surpass old-brand imperialist Britain, which has a fairly developed productive force, in a short period of time. They do not see that behind this poverty and blankness stand 600 million powerful people who can turn the world upside down. The roots of poverty have cultivated their steel-like invincible revolutionary will, and the blank land has encouraged them to have the courage to paint the most beautiful pictures with a spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers. Just cite a few figures: From October of last year to April of this year, the national irrigated area was expanded by 350 million mu, which is 80 million mu more than the total irrigated area increased in the eight years after liberation, and 110 million mu more than the irrigated area achieved in the thousands of years before liberation. During the same period, the national farmers accumulated 310 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average of more than 18,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, which is more than twice as much as the 1956 fertilizer accumulation, which was a very good year. From January to April of this year, more than 290 million mu of afforestation was carried out nationwide, which is equal to one and a half times the total afforestation area in the past eight years.
    Unprovoked inferiority and belittling oneself are the feelings of dwarfs, definitely not the feelings of the people in the Great Leap Forward. These ancient gentlemen who are flipping through old ledgers, like the "loose sand theory" people of the past, only see one side of history. They do not see that the people with revolutionary consciousness are the decisive key to everything. Revolutionary people can change history and create amazing miracles. If one clings to history and cannot see living people, then he can only be thrown into the trash can along with his history.

　　是钢不是沙
　　伊默
    沙和钢，这本来是两种完全不同的东西。就从它们的可以比较的属性来看，也是完全对立的两极。钢，是密度极高又坚又韧的金属，而沙则是用水都不能把它粘合在一起的东西。但是，有时候两种完全不同属性的事物，在一些人的头脑里，却也混淆不清。
    例如过去一些“好心”的读书人，在国家处于外被侵略，内受压迫的时期，总是慨叹中国人好像一盘散沙，如鲁迅所说：“将倒楣的责任，归之于大家。”他们忘记了，即使是沙，也“是统治者治成功的”，更何况自古以来，小民就不是沙，有过多次的民变，造反，团结起来共同给予当时的反动统治者以沉重的打击。
    人民是钢不是沙，这是历史的真实。我们伟大的领袖毛主席正因为对于人民群众有这种历史唯物主义的高度信心，才能在即使表面看来是革命低潮的1930年，洞察到了革命高潮的即将到来：“它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿。”（“星星之火，可以燎原”）
    而现在，当六亿人民在共产党的领导下用他们的钢铁意志建立起新的祖国，并且已经取得巨大建设成绩的今天，却还有些“古久”先生，在我们面前翻着“陈年流水账”，对于我们的社会主义建设事业散播着缺乏信心的论调。这些古久先生中间，有的人只看到了我们国家的一穷二白，他们害怕蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进，只要工作中稍微有些风吹草动，他们就大呼小叫，丧失信心；有的人在全民性的大跃进的海洋里，是只看到了工作中的一些消极黑点，他们虽然不叫喊，却怀着恐惧的心情默默地等待和观望，因此，束手束脚，不敢大胆放手地发动群众。
    这些古久先生不愿意相信，这穷和白的国家，能够像巨龙一样的星飞电掣地跃进；更不敢相信，几世纪以来一直是穷和白的落后国家，能在短时间内赶上和超过那生产力相当发达的老牌帝国主义英国。他们没有看到，在这穷和白的后面，还站立着可以翻转乾坤的强大的六亿人民。穷的根子培养了他们钢铁般的无敌不摧的革命意志，白的大地鼓舞了他们更有气吞山河的勇气画出最美丽的画幅。仅仅举出几个数字吧：从去年10月到今年4月，全国扩大了灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，比解放后八年内增加的灌溉面积总和还多八千万亩，比解放以前几千年间所达到的灌溉面积还多一亿一千万亩。在同一时期，全国农民积肥三千一百亿担，平均每亩可施肥一万八千多斤，按肥效计算比积肥成绩很好的1956年还多两倍以上。从今年1月到4月，全国造林二亿九千万余亩，等于过去八年造林总面积的一倍半。
    无端的自卑感和妄自菲薄，是侏儒的感情，决不是大跃进中人民的感情。这些翻着陈年流水账的古久先生，像过去的“一盘散沙论”者一样，他们只看到了历史的一面，没有看到，有了革命觉悟的人民，是一切决定性的关键。革命的人民可以改变历史，也可以创造惊人的奇迹。如果死抱着历史，看不见活人，那么，他就只能跟着他的历史一起被抛到垃圾箱里去。
