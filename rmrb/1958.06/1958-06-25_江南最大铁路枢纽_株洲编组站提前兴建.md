    Largest Railway Hub in Jiangnan
    Zhuzhou Marshalling Station Begins Construction Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 24th: The largest railway hub south of the Yangtze River – the Zhuzhou Marshalling Station – has recently begun construction.
    This project is one of the state's Second Five-Year Plan projects above the quota, designed by the Fourth Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways based on the actual conditions of China's railways and with reference to Soviet railway hub standards. The project is massive in scale and technically complex, with a total earthwork volume of more than 6 million cubic meters, a total track laying length of more than 100 kilometers, more than 200 sets of turnouts, and three main operating yards for arrival, marshalling, and departure. It also includes the technical transformation of Baima Long, Yijiawan, Zhuzhou and other stations, as well as parts of the Xiangqian Line and the Beijing-Guangzhou Line. After the marshalling yard is put into use, it will not only improve the marshalling capacity of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, but also be able to undertake the tasks of other marshalling stations, enabling railway transportation to further adapt to the requirements of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    The project was originally scheduled to begin construction on July 1st this year. However, thanks to the fact that all employees of the Fourth Engineering Team of the Guangzhou Railway, responsible for the construction, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, especially after studying the Party's general line for socialist construction, mustered their energy, broke with conventions, and worked closely with the design department, adopted the method of "designing while constructing" and started construction early. This year, it will complete 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and 15 kilometers of track laying tasks.

### 江南最大铁路枢纽  株洲编组站提前兴建

    江南最大铁路枢纽
    株洲编组站提前兴建
    新华社长沙24日电　长江以南最大的铁路枢纽——株洲编组站，最近动工兴建。
    这项工程是国家第二个五年计划限额以上工程之一，由铁道部第四设计院根据我国铁路实际状况并参照苏联铁路枢纽的标准设计的。工程规模巨大，技术复杂，全部土石方工作量为六百多万公方，铺轨总长度为一百多公里，道岔二百多组，有到达场、编组场、出发场三个主要作业场，并包括白马垅、易家湾、株洲等站及部分湘黔线、京广线的技术改造工作。编组场开始使用以后，不仅能提高广州铁路局的编组能力，并且可以负担其他编组站的任务，能使铁路运输进一步适应工农业生产大跃进的要求。
    这项工程原计划在今年7月1日动工，但由于负责施工的广州铁路第四工程队的全体职工，经过反右倾保守思想，特别是学习了党的社会主义建设总路线以后，鼓足了干劲，打破了常规，同设计部门密切配合，采取了“边设计、边施工”的办法，提早施工。今年将完成土石方一百二十万公方和发车线十五公里的铺轨任务。
