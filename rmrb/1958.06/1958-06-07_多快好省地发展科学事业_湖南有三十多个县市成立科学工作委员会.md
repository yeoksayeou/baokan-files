To unite and organize scientific and technological forces from all aspects with inventors and innovators among the masses, to better promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and to further promote the mass-based technological and cultural revolution—these are the new tasks and topics proposed to the scientific community of Hunan Province by the recent Hunan Provincial Science Work Conference and the inauguration of the Science Work Committee.

Hunan Province recently convened a conference on the great leap forward in scientific work, attended by 625 people, including scientific workers, production technology innovators, and leaders from various fields and universities. At the closing ceremony, an enlarged meeting of 2,600 people was held, where Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a speech, encouraging everyone to liberate their thinking, establish a communist style, and develop socialist scientific undertakings with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The conference focused on discussing the issue of scientific work serving production, criticizing the bourgeois individualistic ideology and work style of scientific workers who pursue personal fame and fortune, detach themselves from production, reality, and the masses; it gave great encouragement to the inventions and innovations of the working class and peasants in technological innovation and conducted serious research on them. Many folk inventors gave vivid reports at the meeting.

The convening of the Hunan Provincial Science Work Conference greatly promoted the development of scientific undertakings. In less than a month after the conference closed, more than 30 counties and cities across the province had established Science Work Committees, and many counties and cities had established scientific research institutions. Some research institutions have already made significant achievements, such as the Wugang County Comprehensive Science Research Institute, which has conducted experiments on artificial petroleum and rice bran wine brewing. Jin’gang Township in Liuyang has established an agricultural technology research institute, which has conducted a series of experiments on more than ten varieties of close-planted rice and various cash crops.

In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of scientific work, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee established the Science Work Committee on May 18, with Zhou Hui, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, concurrently serving as director. In addition to the heads of various departments and well-known scientists, several young scientific workers, three peasant inventors (Cao Wentao, Li Xingyong, and Yang Xixian), and Ma Youqing, a technician from the Xiangjiang Machine Factory, were also invited as members.

On the third day of the conference, 45 scientific workers were organized to visit Wengjiang Township in Pingjiang County to see the achievements of the production upsurge and technological innovation. Since this spring, this township has created and modified 49 kinds of tools such as automatic harrows and ditching machines, saving more than 280,000 workdays. Through this visit, the scientists saw the infinite wisdom and revolutionary heroic spirit of the masses of peasants, and felt that they must go all out, learn from the masses, so that scientific research can have rich creativity and vigorous vitality.

　　多快好省地发展科学事业
    湖南有三十多个县市成立科学工作委员会
    本报讯　把各个方面的科学技术力量与群众中的创造发明家统一组织起来，更好地促进工农业生产大跃进和进一步推动群众性的技术革命与文化革命，这是最近召开的湖南省科学工作会议和科学工作委员会成立大会给全省科学界提出的新任务和新课题。
    湖南省最近召开了科学工作大跃进的会议，参加会议的有科学工作者、生产技术革新者、各方面和各高等学校的负责人共六百二十五人。闭会时还召开了二千六百人的扩大会议，省委书记周小舟同志讲了话，鼓励大家解放思想，树立共产主义的风格，多快好省地发展社会主义的科学事业。
    会议集中讨论了科学工作为生产服务问题，批判了科学工作者追求个人名位、脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的资产阶级个人主义思想作风；对工农群众在技术革新方面的发明创造给予很大的鼓励，并认真地进行了研究。许多民间发明家在会上作了生动的报告。
    湖南省科学工作会议的召开，大大地推动了科学事业的发展，在会议闭会后不到一个月的时间，全省已有三十多个县市成立了科学工作委员会，不少县市成立了科学研究机构。有些研究机构并已作出了不少成绩，如武冈县的综合科学研究所已经进行了人造石油、稻糠酿酒的试验。浏阳金岗乡已成立了一个农业技术研究所，进行了十多种水稻密植品种试验和多种经济作物等一系列的试验。
    为了加强科学工作的组织领导，湖南省人民委员会在5月18日成立了科学工作委员会，由中共湖南省委书记周惠兼任主任，委员除各厅局负责人、知名的科学家外，还聘请了若干青年科学工作者、三位农民发明家曹文韬、李性永、阳希贤和湘江机器厂的技工马佑清。
    大会的第三天还组织了四十五位科学工作者到平江县瓮江乡参观生产高潮和技术革新的成绩。这个乡在今年春天以来创制和改制了自动耙、翻氹机等工具四十九种，节约了二十八万多个劳动日。通过这次参观，科学家们看到农民群众的无穷智慧和革命英雄气概，感到自己必须鼓足干劲，向群众学习，科学研究才会有丰富的创造性和活泼的生命力。
