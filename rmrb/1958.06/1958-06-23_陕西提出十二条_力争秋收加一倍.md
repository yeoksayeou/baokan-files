Shaanxi Proposes Twelve Articles
Striving to Double the Autumn Harvest

(Our dispatch) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, in order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest and lay a solid foundation for a greater wheat harvest next year, have formulated twelve requirements on June 20th. They call on the whole party to mobilize, the whole people to mobilize, to exert full effort, and to do everything possible to achieve the production increase plan. These twelve requirements are:

(1) Exert full effort, fight hard for four months, and do everything possible to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, exceeding the annual production increase plans of each county and commune.

(2) Double the corn yield per mu. It is necessary to grasp six measures: seize the time, grab the soil moisture, deep plowing and early sowing, three applications of fertilizer (one base fertilizer, two top dressings), six irrigations (sowing, jointing, tasseling, silking, hanging silk, and grain filling), and ditch irrigation. Dry land that can be spot watered must be spot watered, applying 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Vigorously promote close planting, keeping 3,000 seedlings in irrigated fields and generally 2,000 seedlings in dry fields. Cultivate finely three or four times, and promptly mound soil. Move shoots, remove smut, and completely eliminate corn borers. Artificially pollinate two or three times to ensure that every ear has no missing grains and no empty tops.

(3) Double the total rice output. It is necessary to grasp weeding rice, fertilizing, and insect prevention; weed each rice field three times (tillering, jointing, heading). Ensure four fertilizer applications per mu (one base fertilizer, three top dressings), applying at least 20,000 jin. Eliminate rice stem borers and rice leaf rollers, and prevent rice blast early. Irrigate frequently and shallowly, rationally dry the fields, and drain the water completely in the early stage of yellow ripening.

(4) Double the yield of millet per mu. Transplant and replant seedlings to ensure full stands, eliminate millet borers, weed three or four times, and topdress 10,000 jin of fertilizer.

(5) Both sweet potatoes and potatoes must double their yield per mu. Apply fertilizer twice, 10,000 jin per mu each time, weed five or six times, thoroughly prevent potato late blight, turn sweet potato vines to change lifting vines (or build frames), and cut and plant vines to strive for more planting.

(6) Double the cotton yield per mu. Cotton field management is key: quickly set seedlings, universally check seedlings, transplant and replant seedlings to ensure full stands. Spray medicine for prevention when there are no insects, and treat immediately when there are insects. Prevention is more important than treatment. Treat universally, treat continuously, treat thoroughly, treat early, treat well, and treat completely. Four irrigations and three fertilizations. Fine furrow irrigation, use well irrigation for all those with well irrigation equipment, and spot water where possible in dry land. Topdress 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, topdress according to seedling condition, and eliminate third-class cotton. Cultivate six or seven times, and hoe promptly after rain and irrigation. After heavy rains during the peak flowering period, shake off water to prevent waterlogging of flowers. The five-step pruning (strip the "trouser legs", break off buds, remove side shoots, top the apex, and remove old leaves) must be timely.

(7) All kinds of autumn fields must be checked for seedlings and replanted to preserve all seedlings as much as possible; or intercrop and replant beans and vegetables to fully utilize the land fertility.

(8) To double the wheat yield per mu next year and strive for a greater bumper harvest, it all depends on starting early this year. Water (water conservancy), fertilizer, soil (soil improvement), close planting, and seed (improved varieties), lacking any one of these will not work. All wheat fields should be deep plowed once, to a depth of at least eight inches. Fallow land must be plowed by July, using shovels, plows, and mechanized farming, and all methods should be used as much as possible. Harrow and roll in a timely manner to preserve moisture, harrowing and rolling at least two or three times. For returning fields, irrigate and store moisture before the previous crop is harvested, achieving one plowing, two harrowings, and three rollings to eliminate hard stubble planting and strive for early planting. Apply all base fertilizer, 20,000 jin per mu, with layered application for fallow land. Use all improved varieties, implement improved variety combinations, expand the planting area of other improved varieties as much as possible, appropriately reduce the planting area of Bima No. 1, and generally no longer plant Bima No. 1 in low-lying and wet areas. All seeds must be sunned, treated with chemicals, and mixed with fertilizer. All should implement close planting, increase the seeding rate (ensuring 30 jin per mu for irrigated land, 20 jin for dry land, and 15 jin for mountain land), use seed drills, and universally mechanize strip planting. Before sowing, all soil must be treated with chemicals to eliminate underground pests.

(9) Vigorously carry out a shock fertilizer accumulation movement, mobilize the masses, make plans, and carry out competitions. Search for fertilizer, accumulate fertilizer, plant green manure, and every township should produce local chemical fertilizer. Strive to achieve an average of two pigs per household this year. For fertilizer accumulation work, party and government at all levels should designate a main responsible comrade to manage it.

(10) Water conservancy construction must be intensified. Before the end of September, the province will newly increase irrigated land by another 5 million mu. Water storage projects that have already started construction must be completed before the flood season. Repair canals, level land, improve and utilize various water absorption equipment, and fully exert the benefits of irrigation. Require that 90% of the water conservancy projects newly built last winter and this spring be put into summer irrigation, striving to build one mu and use one mu. The people of the whole province must have the determination to win a bumper harvest this autumn even if there is a prolonged drought.

(11) To achieve various production increase measures, solving the shortage of labor is a key. Before the end of September, improved farm tools should be universally used in major farm work and transportation. Try every possible way to save labor, free up women, and participate in production. Every commune should have nurseries, kindergartens, and farm-busy season mess halls, and every commune should have grain processing plants, sewing groups, supply and marketing departments, and credit stations. Every large township commune should have maternity hospitals. Improve the labor management of agricultural cooperatives and overcome the phenomenon of wasting labor. Promote the communist spirit of mutual support and mutual cooperation.

(12) Put politics in command, emancipate the mind, and break down superstitions. Every commune should engage in experimental fields, and every team should cultivate high-yield demonstration fields. Widely carry out mass-based appraisals and competitions, comparing enthusiasm, comparing measures, and comparing results. Plant red flags everywhere, and everyone strives to win the red flag.

    陕西提出十二条
    力争秋收加一倍
    本报讯  中共陕西省委会和陕西省人民委员会，为了争取秋田大丰收和打好明年小麦更大丰收的基础，已经在6月20日制定了十二条要求，号召全党动员，全民动员，鼓足干劲，千方百计地实现增产规划。这十二条要求是：
    （1）鼓足干劲，大战四个月，千方百计力争秋田大丰收，超额完成各县各社全年增产计划。
    （2）玉米亩产加一倍，要抓紧六项措施：抓时间，抢地墒，深耕早播，三肥（底一、浮二）六水（播种、拔节、孕穗、抽雄、吊线、灌浆）开沟灌，旱地能够点浇的必须点浇，每亩施肥两万斤，大力推广密植，水地留苗三千株，旱地一般两千株；细锄三、四次，及时拥好土；搬芽子，去灰包，彻底消灭玉米螟；人工授粉两三次，达到穗穗不缺颗粒不空顶。
    （3）水稻总产加一倍。要抓紧捞稻、施肥和防虫；块块稻田都捞三遍（分蘖、拔节、抽穗）；每亩保证施肥四次（底一、浮三），最少要施两万斤；消灭稻螟虫、稻苞虫，及早防治稻瘟病；勤浇、浅灌，合理晒田，黄熟初期水要落干。
    （4）谷糜亩产加一倍。移栽补苗、保证全苗，消灭蛀谷虫、锄草三、四遍，追肥一万斤。
    （5）红苕洋芋亩产都要加两倍。施肥两次每亩一万斤，锄草五、六遍，彻底防治洋芋晚疫病，红苕翻蔓改提蔓（或搭架），剪蔓插植争取多栽。
    （6）棉花亩产加一倍，棉田管理是关键：快定苗、普遍查苗，移栽补苗，保证全苗；无虫喷药防，有虫立即治，防重于治。普遍治、连续治、彻底治，治早、治好、治了；四水三肥。细流沟灌，有井灌设备的都用井灌，旱地能点浇的都点浇。每亩追肥一万斤，看苗追肥，消灭三类棉；中耕六、七遍，雨后灌后及时锄；盛花大雨后，摇水防灌花；五步整枝（捋裤腿、扳芽子、去旁心、打顶尖、摘老叶）要及时。
    （7）各类秋田都要查苗补苗，尽量保全苗；或套种补种豆类、蔬菜，充分利用地力。
    （8）明年小麦亩产加一倍，争取更大丰收全靠今年早动手。水（水利）、肥（肥料）、土（改良地壤）、密（密植）、种（良种），缺少一样都不行；小麦田全部深翻一遍，深度最少八寸，歇茬地7月要翻完，锨翻、套犁和机耕，所有办法都应尽量采用；及时耙耱、保墒，最少耙耱两三遍；回茬地，前作物收获以前灌水蓄墒，做到一犁二耙三耱，消灭硬茬播种，争取早播；全部施底肥，每亩两万斤，歇茬分层施；全部用良种，实行良种组合，尽量扩大其他良种种植面积，适当压缩碧玛一号种植面积，低湿地区一般不再种碧玛一号。全部实行晒种籽、药剂拌种籽，肥料拌种籽；全部实行密植，加大播种量（保证水地每亩三十斤、旱地二十斤、山地十五斤），使用条播机、普遍条播化；播种前，全部土壤用药剂处理，消灭地下虫害。
    （9）大力开展突击积肥运动，发动群众，作出规划，开展竞赛。搜肥、积肥、种绿肥，乡乡都制土化肥。争取今年实现平均每户两头猪。积肥工作，各级党政都应指定一位主要负责同志管理。
    （10）兴修水利要劲上加劲，9月底前全省再增修水地五百万亩。已动工的蓄水工程，一定要在汛期以前建成。整修渠道，平整土地，改良和利用各种吸水设备，充分发挥灌溉效益，要求去冬、今春新修的水利工程90％投入夏灌，力争修一亩、用一亩。全省人民要有今秋即使久旱无雨也要赢得大丰收的决心。
    （11）实现各项增产措施，解决劳力不足是一关。9月底以前，主要农活和运输都要普遍使用改良农具。想尽一切办法，节省劳力，腾出妇女，参加生产。社社要有托儿所、幼儿园、农忙食堂，社社要有粮食加工厂、缝纫组、供销部、信用站，乡乡大社要有产院。改善农业社的劳动管理，克服浪费劳力现象。发扬互相支援、互相协作的共产主义精神。
    （12）政治挂帅，解放思想，破除迷信。社社都搞试验田，队队培育高额丰产田。广泛开展群众性的评比竞赛，比干劲，比措施，比战果，处处插红旗，人人夺红旗。
