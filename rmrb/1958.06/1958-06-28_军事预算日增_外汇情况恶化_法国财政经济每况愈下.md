Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 26th (by our reporter Yang Xiaonong): Despite the French bourgeois newspapers' repeated efforts to tout the "success" of the de Gaulle government's gold bond issuance in recent days, the worsening financial and economic situation in France is still causing anxiety among the ruling class. The "Echo" newspaper said in a low tone on the 26th that the bond is not a panacea for solving the entire problem.

    This newspaper admits that France's budget expenditures this year far exceed the estimated amount. The main reason for this situation is the Algerian colonial war. In order to step up this war, the de Gaulle government has decided to add 264 billion francs to the military budget. Salan, the commander of the French forces in Algeria, who came to Paris yesterday to meet with de Gaulle, also made a request for reinforcements. At the same time, de Gaulle also expressed his determination to intensify the atomic arms race. All this means that military spending will continue to increase further. Newspapers here believe that the 600 billion franc budget deficit limit will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, French Finance Minister Pinay is already considering new "savings" in so-called secondary sectors, which are actually civilian sectors.

    Another problem that is giving the French ruling group a headache is the foreign trade deficit. According to official statistics, France's foreign trade deficit in May reached 58.5 billion francs, of which 55.7 billion francs were with non-franc zones and 2.8 billion francs with franc zones; while the deficit in April was 39.4 billion francs; and last May it was 44.2 billion francs. In the first five months of this year, France's foreign trade deficit with non-franc zones has reached 222.7 billion francs. Moreover, exports to non-franc zones in May this year accounted for only 65% of imports.

    The sharp increase in the foreign trade deficit has further exacerbated France's predicament of depleting foreign exchange. There are reports that the de Gaulle government is preparing to cut import plans for the second half of the year, reduce imports of raw materials and semi-finished products, and prepare to beg for new loans.

    Recently, Pinay also announced that he is trying to stabilize prices. Prices in France, especially food prices, are still rising continuously. Among them, vegetables, fruits, eggs, etc. have risen by 13% to 22% in the past few days. According to "Echo," prices have risen by an average of 18.8% in the past year.

    It is pointed out that Pinay, who is one of the big capitalists who obtain illegal profits from price gouging, is not really concerned about price stability. The reason he said this is only to resist the increasingly high tide of the French workers and staff demanding wage increases.

    There are reports that the de Gaulle government will soon discuss financial and economic issues. It intends, like previous governments, to take attacking the living standards of the working people, tightening domestic consumption to expand exports, and compressing non-military expenditures as a solution to the difficulties. However, as progressive newspapers here point out, unless the financial bleeding wound of the Algerian colonial war is stopped, France's financial difficulties will only deepen day by day.

    Observers here also point out that compressing domestic consumption, compressing civilian investment, and compressing the raw materials and semi-finished products on which French industry relies are actually stopgap measures, because doing so will inevitably shrink French industrial production, which in turn will further increase the difficulty of exports and reduce fiscal revenue. This vicious cycle will accelerate the process of France's financial depletion and economic recession.

### 军事预算日增　外汇情况恶化  法国财政经济每况愈下

    军事预算日增　外汇情况恶化
    法国财政经济每况愈下
    新华社巴黎26日电　本社记者杨效农报道：尽管法国资产阶级报纸连日来竭力吹嘘戴高乐政府黄金公债发行的“成绩”，法国财政经济状况的每况愈下却仍然使统治阶级苦恼不安。“回声报”26日声调低沉地说，公债并不是解决整个问题的万应灵丹。
    这家报纸承认，法国今年的预算支出远远超过了预计的数目。造成这种情况的主要原因是阿尔及利亚殖民战争。为了加紧进行这个战争，戴高乐政府已经决定追加军事预算二千六百四十亿法郎。昨天来巴黎同戴高乐会谈的驻阿尔及利亚法军司令萨兰，又提出了增援的要求。同时，戴高乐还表示决心加紧原子军备竞赛。这一切就意味着军费仍然要进一步增加。这里的报纸认为，六千亿法郎的预算赤字限额绝难保持。因此，法国财政部长比内已经考虑要在所谓次要部门，其实就是民用部门中，进行新的“节约”。
    使得法国统治集团头痛的另一个问题，是对外贸易逆差的问题。据官方统计，法国5月份对外贸易逆差达五百八十五亿法郎，其中对非法郎区是五百五十七亿法郎，对法郎区是二十八亿法郎；而4月份逆差是三百九十四亿法郎；去年5月是四百四十二亿法郎。今年前五个月，法国对非法郎区的对外贸易逆差已经达到二千二百二十七亿法郎。而且，今年5月份对非法郎区的出口只占进口的65％。
    对外贸易逆差的大大增加使法国外汇枯竭的窘境进一步恶化。有消息说，戴高乐政府准备削减下半年的进口计划，减少原料及半制成品的进口，并且准备乞求新的贷款。
    最近比内还宣布说，他正在设法稳定物价。法国的物价，首先是食品价格，仍然在不断上涨。其中蔬菜、水果、鸡蛋等近几天之内就涨价13％到22％不等。据“回声报”说，一年来物价平均已经上涨了18.8％。
    人们指出，本人就是从哄抬物价中获得非法利润的大资本家之一的比内，其实并不真正关心物价的稳定。他所以这样说，只不过是为了抗拒越来越高涨的法国广大工人和职员要求增加工资的运动罢了。
    有消息说，戴高乐政府不久就要讨论财政经济问题。它打算像过去历届政府一样，把向劳动人民的生活水平进攻、紧缩国内消费以扩大出口和压缩非军事开支等，作为解决困难的办法。然而，正如此间进步报纸指出，阿尔及利亚殖民战争这个财政出血口一天不堵住，法国财政困难就只有一天天加深。
    这里的观察家还指出，压缩国内消费、压缩民用投资以及压缩法国工业所仰赖的原料和半制成品其实是饮鸩止渴的办法，因为这样做就必然会使法国工业生产萎缩，反过来更加增加出口的困难，并且造成财政收入的减少。这种恶性循环将加速法国财政枯竭和经济衰退的过程。
