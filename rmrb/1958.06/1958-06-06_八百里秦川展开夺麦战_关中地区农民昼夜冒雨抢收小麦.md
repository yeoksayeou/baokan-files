    The Eight Hundred Li Qin Chuan Unfolds a Wheat Seizing Battle
    Farmers in the Guanzhong Region Seize and Harvest Wheat Day and Night in the Rain
    (Our dispatch) Since the past few days, farmers in the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi have been fully mobilized, fighting against the overcast and rainy weather, and seizing and harvesting wheat day and night. As of now, the counties where wheat matured earlier, such as Tongguan and Chaoyi, have basically completed the rush harvest. In Weinan, Lintong, and the Xi'an area, the rush harvest army is working hard. Xingping, Wugong, Mei County, Baoji and other counties west of Xi'an have also begun to harvest.
    Now, a battlefield has been set up in the eight hundred li Qin Chuan area, and millions of farmers are wielding sickles, racing against the rain for grain. Tens of millions of cadres, workers, soldiers, and students in various cities and towns are also helping to cut wheat, braving the wind and rain. Thousands of various vehicles are shuttling back and forth from all directions, transporting the newly cut wheat back to the fields. In the past two days alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than five million mu of wheat have been cut and transported back in various places.
    Since May 26, the Guanzhong area has been continuously overcast and rainy, and some early-maturing wheat has shown signs of mold and sprouting. In order to rush the harvest in time, the Party and government leading organs of various counties have held emergency meetings, and many cadres have gone to the countryside overnight to mobilize the masses to launch a comprehensive movement to overcome the wind and rain and rush the wheat harvest.
    Various places have given full play to the spirit of communist cooperation in the rush harvest, helping each other. Members of agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Hu County have come down the mountain to help farmers in the plains with the rush harvest. As of June 2, more than 40,000 mu of mature wheat have been harvested in the county. Farmers in the late harvest areas of Xingping County also supported the early harvest areas with the rush harvest of wheat. More than 400 mountain management and construction teams in the Ziwu District of Chang'an County have been converted into rush harvest commando teams, going down the mountain to help farmers with the rush harvest.

    八百里秦川展开夺麦战
    关中地区农民昼夜冒雨抢收小麦
    本报讯　连日以来，陕西关中地区的农民全体总动员和阴雨战斗，昼夜抢收小麦。截至目前，小麦成熟较早的潼关、朝邑等县已基本抢收完毕。渭南、临潼和西安地区，抢收大军正在紧张抢收。西安以西的兴平、武功、郿县、宝鸡等县也已开始搭镰抢收。
    现在，八百里秦川地区大摆战场，千百万农民群众挥动镰刀，与雨争粮。各地城镇有数以千万计的干部、工人、战士和学生，也不避风雨，帮助抢割麦子。成千上万的各种车辆，从四面八方、穿梭不停地把新割的麦子运回场上。仅近两天不完全统计，各地割倒拉回的麦子已有五百多万亩。
    5月26日以来，关中地区阴雨连绵，部分地区的早熟小麦，已出现发霉和出芽现象。为了及时抢收，各县的党、政领导机关，分别召开紧急会议，许多干部连夜下乡，发动群众全面掀起战胜风雨的抢收小麦运动。
    各地在抢收中发挥了共产主义协作的精神，互相帮助。鄠县山区各农业社的社员纷纷跑下山来，帮助平原地区农民抢收。截至6月2日，全县已收回成熟的小麦四万多亩。兴平县迟收地区的农民也支援早收地区抢收小麦。长安县子午区四百多个治山基建队，已转为抢收突击队，下山帮助农民抢收。（王永）
