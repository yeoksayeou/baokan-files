　　Construction of the Hefei Aluminum Plant has recently commenced. This is a modern non-ferrous metal smelting plant. By breaking with convention and adopting the method of simultaneously collecting data, designing, and ordering equipment, the preparatory work, which originally required one year, was completed in two months.
    Now, inspired by the general line of socialist construction, the plant's construction workers have proposed striving to complete the plant and put it into production by June 1st of next year.

　　合肥铝厂动工兴建
    合肥铝厂在最近动工兴建。这是一座现代化的有色金属冶炼厂。由于打破了常规，采用边搜集资料、边设计、边订购设备的办法，原来需要一年的准备工作，两个月就完成了。
    现在，建厂职工们在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，又提出争取在明年6月1日把厂建成并投入生产。
