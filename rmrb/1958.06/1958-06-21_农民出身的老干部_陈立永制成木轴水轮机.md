    Old Cadre From Peasant Background
    Chen Liyong, Makes Wooden-Axle Water Turbine
    Fujian Province has successfully trial-produced a wooden-axle water turbine. After installation and transportation, its efficiency has proven to be roughly the same as that of water turbines with steel bearings, making it very suitable for small-scale hydropower stations. This creation will not only save the country a large amount of steel but will also greatly accelerate the construction of hydropower stations.
    Chen Liyong, the creator of the wooden-axle water turbine, is an old cadre from a peasant background who received a total of three years of schooling. He is currently a member of the Pinghe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province and the Director of the County Industry Bureau.

    陈立永制成木轴水轮机
    福建省试制成功一种木轴水轮机，经过安装转运证明，效能跟钢铁轴承的水轮机大致相同，很适用于小型水力站。这个创造，不仅可以为国家节约大量钢材，而且将大大加速水力站的建设。
    创造木轴水轮机的陈立永是个农民出身的老干部，共念过三年书，现任中共福建省平和县委委员、县工业局局长。
