New Situation of Water Conservancy Movement
Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power

    The Masses Have Created Miracles

    Since last winter, a new situation has emerged in water conservancy construction. This is not only manifested in the unprecedented speed, scale, and momentum of farmland water conservancy, becoming the vanguard of the great leap forward in agriculture, but also in the fact that the power and wisdom of the masses have broken the old conventions of water management, established the correct line for water conservancy work in China's socialist construction period, and will fundamentally change China's natural landscape within a few years.

    The experience of Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai in Shanxi Province in building barren mountains in Daquan Mountain has developed into a mass, nationwide mountain management movement in many places. The people of Yuxian County, Henan Province, with a large-scale mobilization in mountainous areas and large-scale support in the plains, managed 913 mountain tops throughout the county in one winter and one spring. In the past, it was believed that soil and water conservation would take a long time to take effect. Now it seems that relying on the power of the masses, changing the face of barren mountains can be expected to be achieved in a short period of time.

    The people of Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, have adopted the policy of "adapting, restricting, utilizing, and transforming" to turn five million mu of low-lying, waterlogged alkaline land into paddy fields with a yield of 300 to 400 jin to 1,200 jin per mu. The people of Anhui Province excavated 5 billion cubic meters of earth last winter and this spring, and began to realize the water network of the Huaibei Plain. This provides the correct answer to the treatment of waterlogging: not simply establishing a drainage system to drain the water away, but establishing a water network system to store as much water as possible.

    The people of Wushan County, Gansu Province, overcame numerous difficulties and diverted water to Dongliang Mountain. The people of Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, adopted the method of "comprehensive survey, unified planning, step-by-step damming, mountain opening and canal digging, diverting water from afar, irrigating fields nearby, connecting canals and weirs, and storing water all year round" to connect the previously scattered canals, weirs, ponds, and reservoirs into a complete and comprehensive self-flowing irrigation system, diverting the perennial flow of rivers and streams to the mountain slopes, completely controlling them, and utilizing them. They solved the problem of water conservancy in mountainous and hilly areas, and created a good example for the full utilization of water resources.

    The people of Jiyuan County, Henan Province, have initially successfully managed the Mang River basin. In Henan, the experience was absorbed and developed, resulting in the planning for the management of the Sha and Ying River basins, tributaries of the Huai River, which clarified the policy of "small-scale as the main focus, storage as the main focus, and mass participation as the main focus." Xushui County, Hebei Province, created an engineering system in the plains that combines flood control, waterlogging control, and drought prevention, and integrates surface water and groundwater. The province further proposed a plan to manage the Sha River basin, a tributary of the Daqing River. These plans broke the old idea of mainly relying on point-line engineering control to manage and develop rivers, and determined to carry out large-scale land transformation in mountainous areas, hills, plains, and low-lying areas over a wide area of the basin, supplemented by point-line engineering control on the basis of comprehensive control. That is, adopting the method of "small-scale as the foundation, medium-scale as the backbone, combined with necessary large-scale projects" to carry out river management and development. The plans they made broke the cumbersome procedures of the past and vividly summarized the experience of the masses, thus more closely guiding the struggle of the masses. This planning content and planning method have inspired a new direction for the planning of various river basins.

    A leaping forward situation has also emerged in projects undertaken by the state. The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, with a state-approved budget of more than 400 million yuan, can reduce investment by more than 100 million yuan and generate electricity one year ahead of schedule by carefully calculating, adopting measures such as lowering overly high design standards, improving work efficiency, reducing unit prices, and reducing management costs. The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub, originally scheduled to block floods in 1961 and be completed in 1962, is now also planned to block floods one year ahead of schedule and generate electricity half a year ahead of schedule.

    This movement broke the idea that things can only be done with state funding. Examples in many places show that in the past, waiting for state investment, nothing was accomplished. Now, resolutely relying on the masses has solved the problems left over for thousands of years. In the eight years of managing the Huai River, the state invested a total of 1.45 billion yuan and completed more than 1.6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. This year, in Anhui Province alone, relying mainly on the strength of the masses, more than 5 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work was completed. In the past eight years, Changning County, Hunan Province, only built 60 small reservoirs and one medium-sized reservoir. This year, investment was reduced compared with last year, and relying mainly on self-raised funds by the masses, more than 700 reservoirs were built. In the past, it cost more than 20 yuan per mu to build water conservancy in Laibin County, Guangxi. This year, mainly relying on the masses, the average cost per mu is less than one yuan. This shows that once the masses are mobilized, they can create amazing miracles.

    This movement has also broken the mysterious view of technology and greatly promoted the development of water conservancy technology. The enormous labor of the masses will change the hydrological laws in some places. The various water conservancy plans created by the masses, such as "long vines bearing melons," "white horse parting its mane," "grape bunches," and "stars all over the sky," have greatly enriched the experience of their predecessors. After the engineering technology of dam construction and sluice gate construction was mastered by the masses, various engineering forms have developed. Not only have various places built a large number of earth dams, but they have also begun to build various types of dams such as rockfill dams, masonry dams, and earth-rock mixed dams. Not only have they successfully built a large number of dams 20 to 30 meters high, but they also dare to build dams 40 to 50 meters and even higher. Under the needs of the project, soil cement has been made in many places, and various improved and semi-automated tools have appeared. All this shows that after the broad masses master technology, an endless sea of wisdom is formed, and water conservancy technology will leap forward on the basis of popularization.

    This movement has also broken the old concept of "who benefits, who pays" and demonstrated the people's socialist consciousness and heroic spirit. Water conservancy construction has not only broken the boundaries of individual households long ago, but has also begun to break the boundaries of societies, townships, and even districts and counties, becoming a nationwide socialist construction movement. The awakened people have changed the face of water conservancy construction, and the achievements of water conservancy construction have further promoted the improvement of the people's communist ideology.

    This situation is of course not accidental. Without the comprehensive victory of cooperation in the countryside, without the victory of the rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and anti-waste, anti-conservatism struggle nationwide, the new situation in water conservancy construction would certainly not have been possible. With all these general favorable situations, without the direct leadership of the Central Committee and the party committees at all levels, the new situation in water conservancy construction would not have been possible either. This nationwide water conservancy movement under the direct leadership of the Party is a profound rectification for all comrades in our water conservancy department. Some old concepts left over from water conservancy books and some old ideas fixed in past work have been broken one by one in this movement. Many comrades in the water conservancy department have barely kept up with the movement in the process of both breaking and establishing. Many comrades only gradually realized the importance of relying on the masses to build water conservancy after going to the countryside for investigation.

    The Struggle Between Two Roads

    Now it can be clearly seen that the correct path for water conservancy construction should be: focusing on water storage, focusing on small-scale projects, and focusing on self-management by the masses. On this basis, combined with necessary drainage, large and medium-sized projects, and projects undertaken by the state, to achieve water conservancy by the whole party and water conservancy by the whole people, turning water disasters into water conservancy in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, in order to meet the needs of socialist industrial and agricultural development. This path correctly embodies the general line of socialist construction, which is the mass line in water conservancy construction.

    There is also another line that is opposed to the above-mentioned line, which is the line of focusing on drainage, focusing on large-scale projects, and focusing on projects undertaken by the state. Implementing this line will inevitably lead to less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. Obviously, this line does not conform to the general line of socialist construction. The basic issue of the two lines lies in: who to rely on to build water conservancy? What spirit to use to manage water? Is it to rely on a few people and have the state undertake some projects to solve the water conservancy problem? Or to rely more on the localities, mobilize 600 million people, and have the whole party and the whole people build water conservancy? To use a negative spirit to manage water? Or to use a positive spirit to manage water? Past work has proved that the struggle between the two lines exists. However, in our past leadership work, the understanding of this struggle was not clear. In many issues, it was the thinking of "drainage, large-scale, and state-run" rather than the thinking of "storage, small-scale, and mass-run."

    In the past, in our water conservancy construction policy, we once proposed the policy of giving equal importance to large, medium, and small projects, and giving equal consideration to storage and drainage, but we did not emphasize the policy of focusing on storage and small-scale projects. Among many water conservancy cadres, there was once the idea of emphasizing large-scale projects and neglecting small-scale projects. On the issue of developing irrigation and soil and water conservation, everyone agreed on the point of mainly relying on the masses and small-scale projects, and this is what we did in the past. However, there were different views on how much effect the construction of a large number of small water conservancy projects could have on floods. In the past, in the Huai River and Hai River basin plans, the role of mass small-scale projects was not taken into account in solving the flood problem; in solving the waterlogging problem, the method of storage was often not considered, but the method of drainage was adopted. For example, the waterlogging removal work in the past in the Huai River management was like this. The method of dredging and digging rivers was always adopted, resulting in more money spent and slower results, and the water was also drained away. The more drainage, the more disputes between the upstream and downstream. This year, northern Anhui and Henan are advocating solving the waterlogging disaster in the Huai River basin mainly by storage, and many places in northern Anhui have even proposed a plan to universally dig ditches and create a water network. It is estimated that after the implementation of these plans, the waterlogging disaster can be fundamentally solved, and a large number of paddy fields can be developed at the same time. In the past, the main idea of building water conservancy was to rely on state investment, and the enormous power of the masses was greatly underestimated.

    On technical issues, we have both empiricism and dogmatism. In the water conservancy experience passed down in China for thousands of years, drainage has always been considered the correct path. Because the water systems of the Huai River and the Hai River were damaged by the Yellow River, the dream of water management for many years was to restore the previous drainage system, which seemed to be a ready-made path. Changing drainage to water storage is a completely new idea. This idea has caused a series of concerns: Can so much earthwork be done? Is it worthwhile to dig up so much land? Will blocking water cause disputes? In short, people are afraid to imagine new problems, dare not try them out, and even do not seriously study what the masses have created. Since 1955, our basin planning work carried out on many rivers has played a certain role in comprehensively collecting data and studying the layout of large-scale projects, but there is also a large amount of dogmatism. Technicians copied the Yellow River plan without modification. Although we have also tried to break the superstition several times, it has only stayed at general discussions in thought, and we have not been able to grasp the specific arguments in the plan and attack them. The Hai River basin plan was made under our direct leadership. Although the plan was written in several large volumes, it failed to solve the essential problem of managing the Hai River, that is, mainly relying on the masses to manage the Hai River. In terms of irrigation projects, although China's irrigation area was already the first in the world in 1952, it should be said that the masses have very rich experience, but we have not seriously summarized these experiences, but have stipulated many unnecessary rules and regulations, requiring excessively high and detailed data, which have tied the hands and feet of local authorities and the masses. Even slightly larger irrigation projects were not allowed to "act rashly." In 1952, the Dayuzhang project of Yellow River irrigation in Shandong Province, which was originally scheduled to start construction, was stopped. In 1953, the Han River irrigation project in Guangdong Province, which was originally scheduled to start construction, was stopped. The design of irrigation projects done after this probably required more than a dozen large volumes of data. Many Yellow River irrigation projects that started construction last year broke this superstition. According to the old specifications, it would take three years to complete such a large-scale irrigation area design. But this time, all the design rights were delegated to the special zones, counties, and districts, which were responsible for consulting with the masses to determine the canal routes themselves, and the design and construction were completed in less than half a year.

    The above situation shows that in order not to commit right-leaning conservative errors, it is necessary to be both red and expert, and first of all to be red. Therefore, in the leadership work of our business departments, we must first focus on the abstract, and if the political thought is correct, the business can be correct. In the past, our leadership methods did not grasp this point well. We paid close attention to specific issues, but we could not sit down and talk about the ideological problems of cadres and the issues of the guidelines and lines in the work. This is our biggest lesson in this rectification and great leap forward.

    In the nine years after liberation, from 1950 to 1955, the irrigated area was expanded by a total of 140 million mu. From the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, in one upsurge, the irrigated area was expanded by 120 million mu, close to the total of the past five years. From the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957, after the anti-rash advance, only more than 36 million mu were completed. From the winter of 1957 to the present, in the situation of the great leap forward, the irrigated area has been expanded by 400 million mu, not only exceeding the total area expanded in the eight years after liberation, but also exceeding the accumulated irrigated area in the thousands of years before liberation. On the issue of water conservancy, it can be clearly seen whether it is better to "rush forward" or "anti-rush forward." However, after the upsurge in 1956, the water conservancy movement was subjected to many unwarranted attacks. Some people exaggerated the individual shortcomings that occurred in well-drilling and said that the entire well-drilling was wrong, and even that the entire water conservancy movement was wrong. In fact, the shortcomings in well-drilling were only isolated phenomena that occurred in Hebei, Henan, Shandong and other provinces. Taking Henan Province as an example, according to the 1957 inspection, among the wells drilled in the upsurge in 1956, 48% were very good, 47% were slightly worse and could expand benefits with slight repairs, and only 5% were abandoned wells. We cited the materials from Henan at that time to refute this attack. However, due to our low political level and lack of style, during the low ebb from 1956 to 1957, although we wanted to do more things ideologically, we showed insufficient enthusiasm in arranging work.

    The upsurge this year is not that everyone's views are consistent. The "watchers" are waiting for the arrival of autumn to have another "anti-rush forward", or are looking for individual shortcomings to attack. Therefore, we should strive to do our work better, especially before the arrival of the flood season, we should carefully check the medium-sized projects to avoid major problems. However, in such a vigorous movement involving hundreds of millions of people, individual shortcomings and errors are always unavoidable. Our analysis of the projects done this year is as follows:

    From last winter to the present, the projects done nationwide have completed 33 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, which can expand the irrigation area by 400 million mu, improve the irrigation area by 160 million mu, control waterlogging by 220 million mu, and complete the initial control of soil and water conservation over 200,000 square kilometers.

    Among the 400 million mu of irrigation area projects that have been completed, approximately 50% to 60% have already yielded benefits. A considerable number of water storage projects can play a role after storing water during the flood season. A portion of the projects, due to insufficient water sources or unresolved water lifting tools, or the land has not yet been leveled, can currently play a partial irrigation or drought resistance role, and need to continue to develop water sources, resolve water lifting tools, and level the land before they can fully play a role. A portion of the irrigation areas need to level the land and divert water for irrigation after the wheat harvest. There are also a few projects that may find some problems in the actual test of water storage and diversion, and need to be repaired before they can be used.

    In the completed waterlogging control and soil and water conservation projects, we should also estimate the imbalance of work. A portion of the projects are completely up to standard and can achieve the expected benefits; a portion are not completely up to standard and can currently yield partial benefits, and need to be properly repaired to achieve the predetermined benefits.

    In addition, we must also estimate the possibility that special flood and drought disasters will occur in local areas across the country every year. In fact, since last winter, severe drought conditions have formed in the North China region. If it were not for the continuous and vigorous drought resistance from last winter to this spring, the historical drought disaster may have already replayed. Although the drought conditions have been initially relieved, we still need to estimate the possibility of the recurrence of drought conditions. At the same time, we also need to estimate that there is still a possibility of particularly heavy rainstorms occurring in local areas during this year's flood season. Under the attack of particularly heavy rainstorms, some newly completed projects may suffer some damage, and at least a few may be washed away. This should also be expected, and we should try our best to prevent it.

    Among the large number of projects that have been completed, more than half have already produced benefits, a portion will play a role in a few months, and a portion will play a role after repairs. A very small number may suffer damage and failure due to special reasons. It should be said that this is in line with the laws of work development. This shows that the development of the movement is healthy, and cadres and the masses have learned from the experience of the 1956 water conservancy upsurge and have improved their work a step further.

    Current Tasks

    The current tasks of the water conservancy movement are: to continue to work hard to ensure that the vast majority of projects pass the flood season test and play a role; at the same time, we are also prepared to meet the attack of unexpected disasters, so that cadres and the masses establish the determination to make persistent efforts, be indomitable, and repeatedly fight against nature.

    The south has begun to enter the flood season, and the north will gradually approach the flood season. We hope that all localities will pay special attention to this year's flood prevention work, seize the time to complete unfinished projects, strengthen inspections before the flood season and make preparations, strengthen protection during the flood season, and strive for each project to store water and be protected from collapse. We should also be highly vigilant against the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Hai River, Huai River, Liao River, Songhua River, Pearl River and other important rivers, and prevent the attack of particularly large floods.

    Transforming nature is a long-term struggle. In order to fully grasp the situation and continuously verify and revise the original plans and designs, we have made arrangements for scientific research work. At the same time, we also hope that all localities will universally carry out observation and research work, especially to concentrate efforts on studying the impact and role of various mass water conservancy projects in overcoming floods, and strive to draw conclusions within two or three years. In the Yellow River basin, we should pay special attention to reducing the impact and role of sediment. We advocate that each society and each township carry out simple hydrological and meteorological observations, lay the foundation this year, and continue to develop in the future. In areas in the north threatened by salinization, we should also pay attention to the testing of soil salinity at any time.

    In the coming winter and spring, and even in the next few years, in addition to developing a large number of small water conservancy projects, there are many things to do for the completed small water conservancy projects. The completed small projects need to be continuously repaired and strengthened to improve standards. Projects that have been raised in standards also need to be frequently protected and maintained every year to ensure benefits. Fish scale pits need to be planted with trees and maintained well until the hillside is greened. The edges of fields in mountainous and hilly areas need to be continuously processed until they are terraced. Water wells and ponds need to solve water lifting tools, and each irrigation project must be able to divert water for irrigation.

    Some areas have begun to build medium-sized projects, and this type of medium-sized projects will continue to increase. After mastering the technology of small-scale projects, the masses are fully qualified to further master the technology of medium-sized projects. Since medium-sized projects are generally larger in scale and technically more complex, and in case of accidents, the stakes are also greater. During the initial period of mass-run medium-sized projects, we should actively strengthen technical guidance and strive to ensure the safety of medium-sized projects.

    While developing various small-scale projects, we should also advocate the large-scale construction of small hydropower stations. In planning ideas, we should advocate using water energy to generate electricity as much as possible. If the conditions for power generation are not yet available, we can and should advocate directly using water energy for agricultural and sideline product processing and irrigation. To build hydropower stations, we must first solve the problem of manufacturing water turbines and generators. We propose that medium and small water turbines and generators should be manufactured by the masses and local authorities as much as possible.

    Need for a Greater Leap Forward

    On the basis of the current new situation in water conservancy construction, in the Second Five-Year Plan, water conservancy construction should and can have a greater leap forward. Our country is a country with abundant water resources and very serious water and drought disasters. The experience of the past few years has proved that water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and to ensure agricultural production increases, we must do a good job in water conservancy. Under the requirements and efforts of the broad masses of people, it is entirely possible to basically eliminate ordinary water and drought disasters in the Second Five-Year Plan and complete the requirements in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. China's hydropower resources rank first in the world and have superior development conditions. While eliminating ordinary water and drought disasters, the development of hydropower resources should become an important aspect of water conservancy construction. It can be expected that on the basis of large-scale water conservancy construction, a large-scale hydropower construction upsurge will inevitably arrive. We should promote the arrival of this upsurge from all aspects, vigorously change the backward state of hydropower resource development, and strive to achieve basically equal installed capacity of hydropower and thermal power by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, in order to quickly realize the central government's policy of hydropower as the main and thermal power as the auxiliary in power construction, and lay the foundation for catching up with Britain in electricity within fifteen years.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we have made the following arrangements for river management and development, power construction, and irrigation:

    For the management and development of the Songhua River, Liao River, Hai River, Yellow River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River, we should absorb the experience of water conservancy construction in the past few years, especially the experience of the mass water conservancy construction upsurge from last winter to this spring, and adopt a method that combines tributaries and main streams, upper, middle and lower reaches, large, medium and small projects, points, lines and surfaces, and comprehensively develops flood control, power generation, irrigation, and shipping. Under the conditions of close combination of the central and local governments and more reliance on the local governments, we will strive to basically eliminate the disasters of ordinary floods during the Second Five-Year Plan period and develop irrigation and hydropower more. Other small and medium-sized rivers across the country will be managed separately by each province, and we will also strive to eliminate ordinary flood disasters during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

    For the management and development of the Yangtze River, we will resolutely follow the central government's decision, actively study and solve various problems of building the Three Gorges Hub, and submit the design on schedule. For the tributaries of the Yangtze River basin, wherever the conditions are ripe, we should actively build reservoirs and hydropower stations. For the particularly large floods of the Yangtze River, before the construction of the Three Gorges Project, we should actively find various ways to prevent them.

    In terms of developing irrigation, relying mainly on the mass water conservancy movement, combined with necessary large and medium-sized projects, we will expand the irrigation area by 700 million mu. By 1962, we will have 1.2 billion mu of paddy fields and irrigated land, accounting for more than 70% of the cultivated land area, basically realizing water conservancy and eliminating ordinary drought disasters. The distribution of water in China is uneven. The Yangtze River basin and the areas south of the Yangtze River have abundant water, and there is a surplus for irrigation; the Huai River basin, especially the areas north of the Yellow River and the Northwest region, have insufficient water, and the development of irrigation is limited, especially the large-scale development of rice is limited. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should seriously study the problem of diverting water from the Yangtze River and Han River to the north. The problem of groundwater and artesian wells should also be studied.

    In terms of soil and water conservation, it is required to complete an area of ​​1 million square kilometers. By 1962, 1.2 million square kilometers of soil erosion area will be under initial control, accounting for approximately 80% of the soil erosion area (the national soil erosion area is approximately 1.5 million square kilometers).

    In terms of waterlogging control, combined with the large-scale development of rice, it is required to complete 330 million mu. By 1962, a total of 420 million mu of waterlogging control area will be completed, basically solving the problem of waterlogging.

    In the power stations to be added during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should strive to have hydropower account for approximately half of the total. In rural hydropower, we will strive to develop hydropower stations with an installed capacity of more than 3 million kilowatts. To achieve this goal, we must implement the policy of small-scale as the main, society-run as the main, serving production as the main, and combining lighting.

    To realize the above tasks of water conservancy construction, the key issue is to conscientiously study and implement the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Central Committee, and take the road of "storage, small-scale, and mass-run" as the main focus of water conservancy construction. From the past work lessons, we deeply realize that our ideological level is still very low, we have blindness in implementing the Central Committee's guidelines and lines, and we are ideologically bound by many dogmatisms and empiricisms. Therefore, conscientiously studying Mao Zedong's thought, conscientiously studying dialectics and materialism, and seeking communist ideological liberation are the main keys to doing a good job in future work. In terms of working methods, we must conscientiously engage in experimental fields, discover typical examples, summarize typical examples, use typical examples, and organize visits to guide work.

    To take the mass line, we must rely more on the local governments and resolutely implement the policy of combining the central and local governments. Everything that can be done by the local governments should be handed over to the local governments; everything that can be done by the masses should be handed over to the masses; they will do it more, faster, better, and more economically. This year's water conservancy movement is proof of this. In order to enable local authorities to do more things, we must also help local authorities and the masses solve difficult problems, mainly helping local authorities solve the problem of technical strength, so that each province can design and construct its own general water conservancy and hydropower projects. We are preparing to adjust the design and construction forces belonging to the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power in the near future, delegating a large part of them to support areas with weak technical strength and particularly heavy tasks, and actively helping each province to formulate a plan for developing and enriching water conservancy and hydropower forces.

    In order to implement the spirit of further relying on local governments and relying on the masses, we must also break some unreasonable rules and regulations. In the past, we stipulated too much content for basin planning and design documents, which should be streamlined. We also grasped too much the approval of design documents. We hope that the State Planning Commission and the Economic Commission will revise the regulations on the quota for capital construction projects and delegate more approval work to the provinces. In addition, there are many financial systems that are also stipulated too strictly and rigidly, making it impossible for grassroots units to work proactively, and even making it impossible for each province and each department to proactively solve problems, which limits the enthusiasm of all parties. These unreasonable rules and regulations should be reformed.

    We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it is entirely possible to achieve the requirements of the Forty Articles of the Water Conservancy Plan ahead of schedule, and for power construction to catch up with Britain ahead of schedule.

    水利运动的新形势
    水利电力部副部长  李葆华
    群众创造了奇迹
    去年冬季以来，水利建设出现了新形势。这不仅表现在农田水利以史无前例的速度、规模和声势开展起来，成为农业大跃进中的前浪，而且表现在群众的力量和智慧打破了治水的陈规，为我国社会主义建设时期的水利工作确定了正确的路线，并将在几年之内基本上改变我国的自然面貌。
    山西省大泉山张凤林、高进才建设荒山的经验，在很多地方发展成为群众性、全民性的治山运动。河南省禹县人民以山区大动员、平原大支援的方式，一冬一春治理了全县九百一十三个山头。过去认为，水土保持需要很长的时间才能生效，现在看来，依靠群众力量，改变荒山面貌，可以期望在不长的时间内实现。
    河北省天津专区的人民，采取“适应、限制、利用、改造”的方针，使五百万亩洼涝碱地变成亩产三、四百斤到一千二百斤的水稻田。安徽省人民去冬今春挖土五十亿公方，开始实现淮北平原水网化。这样就给治理内涝找到正确的答案：不是单纯地建立排水系统，把水排走，而是建立水网系统，尽可能地把水蓄起来。
    甘肃省武山县人民，克服重重困难，把水引上东梁山。湖北省襄阳专区人民，采取“全面勘察、统一规划、节节拦河、盘山开渠、远处引水、近处灌田、渠堰相连、常年蓄水”的办法，把过去分散的渠、堰、塘、库，连结成为一个完整的全面的自流灌溉系统，把河、溪的常流水引上山坡，全部控制起来，并且利用起来。他们解决了山区和丘陵区的水利化问题，并且为充分利用水利资源创造了良好的范例。
    河南省济源县人民初步成功地治理了漭河流域。在河南吸收与发展了这个经验，产生了治理淮河支流沙、颍河流域的规划，明确了“小型为主、以蓄为主、群众举办为主”的方针。河北省的徐水县创造了平原地区防洪、治涝、防旱结合并使地上水、地下水互相结合的工程系统。该省并进一步提出了治理大清河支流沙河流域的规划。这些规划打破了主要依靠点线的工程控制来治理和开发河流的老思想，确定了在流域广大面积上进行山区、丘陵、平原、洼地的大地改造，在全面控制的基础上辅以点线的工程控制。也就是采取“以小型为基础、中型为骨干、结合必要的大型工程”的作法进行河流治理与开发。他们做的规划，打破了过去繁琐的程式，比较生动活泼地概括了群众经验，因而更密切地指导了群众的斗争。这种规划内容和规划方法，为各河的流域规划启示了一个新的方向。
    在国家举办的工程中，也出现了跃进的形势。新安江水电站，国家核准的预算是四亿多元，经过精打细算，采用降低过高的设计标准、提高工作效率、降低单价、缩减管理费用等措施后，可以减少一亿多元的投资，并且提前一年发电。三门峡水利枢纽，原定1961年拦洪，1962年完成，现在也计划提前一年拦洪，提前半年发电。
    这次运动打破了只有国家花钱才能办事的思想。许多地方的例子说明：过去等国家投资，什么事也没办成，现在坚决依靠群众，就把千年留下的问题解决了。治淮八年，国家共投资十四亿五千万元，作了十六亿多方的土石方，今年仅安徽一省，主要依靠群众力量，就做了五十多亿方的土石方。湖南省常宁县八年来只修了六十座小型水库和一座中型水库，今年，投资比去年减少了，主要依靠群众自筹，却修建了七百多座水库；广西来宾县过去修水利一亩要花二十多元，今年主要依靠群众，每亩平均还用不到一元钱。这说明群众一旦发动起来，就可以做出惊人的奇迹来。
    这一运动也打破了技术的神秘观点，并大大推动了水利技术的发展。群众的巨大劳动在某些地方将改变水文的规律。群众所创造的“长藤结瓜”、“白马分鬃”、“葡萄串”、“满天星”等多种多样的水利规划，大大地丰富了前人的经验。筑坝修闸的工程技术为群众掌握后，各式各样的工程型式发展起来了。各地不仅大量修建土坝，而且开始修建堆石坝、砌石坝、土石混合坝等各种型式的坝；不仅成功地大量修建了二、三十公尺高的坝，而且敢于修建四、五十公尺和更高的坝。在工程需要下，土水泥在许多地方制成，各式各样改良的、半自动化的工具出现了。这一切说明，在广大群众掌握技术之后，就形成了无尽的智慧的海，水利技术将在普及的基础上飞跃提高。
    这一运动也打破了“谁受益，谁负担”的老观念，表现了人民的社会主义觉悟与英雄气概。水利建设不仅早已打破了一家一户的界限，而且开始打破社、乡以至区、县的界限，成为全民的社会主义建设运动。觉悟了的人民改变了水利建设的面貌，水利建设的成果也进一步推动了人民共产主义思想的提高。
    这种形势当然不是偶然出现的。如果没有合作化在农村的全面胜利，如果没有整风、反右派斗争和反浪费、反保守主义斗争在全国范围内的胜利，水利建设的新形势当然不可能出现。有了这一切总的有利形势，如果没有中央和各级党委的直接领导，水利建设的新形势也不可能出现。这个在党直接领导下的全民性的水利运动，对我们水利部门的全体同志，是一次深刻的整风。水利书本上留传下的一些旧概念，过去工作中所固定起来的一些旧思想，在这次运动中一个个被打破。水利部门的许多同志，是在又破又立的过程中，才勉强跟上了运动。有不少的同志，经过下乡考察以后，才逐步认识依靠群众兴修水利的重要性。
    两条道路的斗争
    现在可以明显地看出，水利建设的正确道路应当是：以蓄水为主、以小型为主、以群众自办为主，在这个基础上，结合必要的排水、大中型和国家举办的工程，达到全党办水利，全民办水利，多、快、好、省地把水患变为水利，以适应社会主义工农业发展的需要。这条道路正确地体现了社会主义建设总路线，也就是水利建设中的群众路线。
    和上述路线相对立的也存在着另外一条路线，这就是：以排水为主、以大型为主、以国家举办为主的路线。实行这条路线，必然是少、慢、差、费。很明显，这条路线是不符合社会主义建设总路线的。两条路线的基本问题在于：依靠谁办水利？用什么精神来治水？是依靠少数人员，由国家举办若干工程来解决水利问题？还是更多地依靠地方，发动六亿人民，全党全民办水利？用消极的精神来治水？还是用积极的精神来治水？过去工作证明，两条路线的斗争是存在的。但是在我们过去的领导工作中，对这个斗争的认识是不明确的，在许多问题上，是“排、大、国”的思想，而不是“蓄、小、群”的思想。
    过去我们在水利建设方针上，曾经提出过大中小并重、蓄泄兼筹等方针，没有强调以蓄为主、小型为主的方针。在不少水利干部中，曾经有过重大型轻小型的思想。在发展灌溉与水土保持问题上，主要依靠群众与小型这一点大家意见是一致的，而且过去也是这样做了的，但是对于兴建大量的小型水利工程对洪水能起多大作用，就有各种不同的看法。在过去编制的淮河及海河流域规划中，在解决洪水问题上，没有将群众小型工程的作用考虑进去；在解决内涝问题上，时常不考虑采取蓄的办法，而是采取排的办法。例如过去治淮工作中的除涝工作就是这样，总是采用疏浚挖河的办法，结果是花钱多、收效慢，把水也排走了，越排水，上下游的纠纷就越多。今年皖北及河南都提倡以蓄为主解决淮河流域的涝灾，皖北许多地方更提出普遍挖沟洫、水网化的规划。这些规划实现后，估计可以根本解决涝灾问题，同时可以大量地发展水稻田。过去办水利，主要的思想是依靠国家投资，对于群众的巨大力量的估计是很不够的。
    在技术问题上，我们有经验主义，也有教条主义。在我国几千年传下来的水利经验中，排水一直被认为是正确路线。由于淮河、海河的水系是被黄河破坏的，多少年来治水的梦想是恢复以前的排水系统，似乎这是一条现成的道路。改排水为蓄水，这是一个完全新的想法，这个想法引起了一系列的顾虑：能否做这么多的土方？挖压许多土地是否上算？堵水拦水是否会造成纠纷？总之，对新的问题不敢设想，不敢试办，甚至群众创造了也不去认真研究。1955年以来，我们在许多河流上进行的流域规划工作，在全面搜集资料、研究大型工程的布置上虽然起了一定作用，但是也存在大量的教条主义。技术人员照搬照套黄河规划，虽然我们也几次企图破除迷信，但是只停留在思想上的泛论，没有能抓住规划中的具体论点攻破。海河流域规划是在我们直接领导下做的，虽然规划写了几大本，但是没有能解决治理海河的本质问题，即主要依靠群众治理海河的问题。在灌溉工程方面，虽然我国的灌溉面积在1952年就已居世界第一位，应该说在群众中有极丰富的经验，但我们没有认真地总结这些经验，却规定了许多不必要的规章制度，要求资料过高过细，束缚了地方与群众的手脚，稍大的灌溉工程都不让“轻举妄动”。1952年，将原定开工的山东省引黄灌溉的打渔张工程停下来，1953年，将原定开工的广东省的引韩灌溉工程停下来。在这以后所做的灌溉工程设计，大概都要十几大本的资料。去年开工的许多引黄灌溉工程就打破了这种迷信。如果按照老的规格，三年也完成不了这样大规模的灌区设计。但是这次将设计权统统下放，由专区、县、区负责和群众商议自定渠线，在不到半年时间内连设计带施工都完成了。
    以上情况说明，要不犯右倾保守错误，必须又红又专，而且首先要红。因此，在我们业务部门的领导工作中，首先必须务虚，政治思想搞对了，业务才能对头。过去我们的领导方法，正是没有抓好这一条。对具体问题很注意，但是对于干部的思想问题，对工作中的方针路线问题，不能经常地坐下来谈谈。在这次整风与跃进中，这是我们的最大的教训。
    解放后九年来，从1950年到1955年共扩大灌溉面积一亿四千万亩；从1955年冬到1956年春，在一个高潮中，扩大灌溉面积即达一亿二千万亩，接近过去五年的总和；从1956年冬到1957年春，在反冒进之后，只完成了三千六百多万亩；从1957年冬到现在，在大跃进的形势中，扩大了灌溉面积四亿亩，不但超过了解放后八年扩大面积的总和，而且超过了解放前几千年累积的灌溉面积。在水利问题上，可以鲜明地看出，是“冒进”好呢？还是“反冒进”好。但是在1956年高潮之后，水利运动受到了很多不应有的攻击。有些人夸大打井中发生的个别缺点，说成整个打井都错了，甚至说成整个水利运动都错了。其实打井中的缺点只是在河北、河南、山东等省发生的个别现象。以河南省为例，根据1957年检查，在1956年高潮中所打的井中，48％是很好的，47％差些，稍加整修即可扩大效益，废井只有5％。我们当时引用了河南的材料驳斥了这种攻击。但是由于我们政治水平低，风格不高，在1956年到1957年低潮时期，虽然思想上想多做些事情，但是在布置工作时却表现了干劲不足。
    今年的高潮，也不是所有的人的看法都是一致的，“观潮派”正在等待秋季的到来，再来一个“反冒进”，或者在寻找个别缺点加以攻击。因此，我们应当努力把工作做得更好些，特别是在洪水到来前，应将中型工程认真进行检查，不要出大乱子。但是，在这样一个几亿人民参加的轰轰烈烈的大运动中，个别的缺点、错误总是不可避免的。对于今年所做的工程，我们的分析是这样：
    去冬到现在全国所做的工程，完成土石方三百三十亿公方，共可扩大灌溉面积四亿亩，改善灌溉面积一亿六千万亩，治涝二亿二千多万亩，完成水土保持初步控制二十万平方公里。
    在已完成的四亿亩灌溉面积的工程中，大约有50％到60％已经发挥了效益。有相当数量的蓄水工程，在汛期蓄水后，就可以发生作用。有一部分工程，由于水源不够或者提水工具没有解决，或者土地还没有平整，目前可以起部分灌溉或抗旱作用，需要继续开辟水源、解决提水工具、平整土地后才能完全发挥作用。有一部分灌区需要在收麦后才能平整土地，引水浇地。也有少数工程，在蓄水、引水的实际考验中，可能发现一些问题，需要经过整修才能使用。
    在已完成的治涝和水土保持工程中，也应当估计到工作的不平衡性。有一部分工程是完全合乎规格，可以起到预期效益的；有一部分不完全合乎规格，目前可以起部分效益，需要适当整修才能达到预定效益。
    此外，还必须估计到全国每年都会有局部地区发生特殊水旱灾害的可能。事实上，从去冬以来，华北地区已经形成严重旱象，如果不是去冬到今春不断地大力抗旱，历史上的旱灾可能已经重演。现在旱象虽然初步解除，还需要估计到旱象再度发生的可能。同时，也需要估计到今年汛期仍会有局部地区发生特大暴雨的可能，在特大暴雨的袭击下，部分新成的工程受一些损伤，以至少数被冲垮，这也是应该预计到的，我们应该尽量加以预防。
    在已完成的大量工程中，半数以上已经发生效益，一部分在几个月以后发挥作用，一部分经过整修以后发挥作用，很少数可能由于特殊原因受到损伤和失效。应当说，这是合乎工作发展的规律的。这说明，运动的发展是健康的，干部和群众吸取了1956年水利高潮的经验，将工作提高了一步。
    当前任务
    水利运动的当前任务是：继续努力，争取绝大多数的工程通过汛期考验，发挥效益；同时，也准备迎接意外灾害的袭击，使干部和群众确立再接再厉、百折不挠、与大自然反复搏斗的决心。
    目前南方已开始进入汛期，北方也将逐步接近汛期，我们希望各地特别注意今年的防汛工作，抓紧完成未了工程，在汛前加强检查做好准备，汛期加强防护，争取每个工程都蓄住水，保住不垮。对黄河、长江、海河、淮河、辽河、松花江、珠江等重要河流也要提高警惕，防备特大洪水的袭击。
    改造自然是个长期斗争。为了充分掌握情况，不断验证、修订原有的规划设计，我们对科学研究工作已经作了布置，同时也希望各地普遍展开观测、研究工作，特别要集中力量研究各种群众性水利工程战胜洪水有多大的影响和作用，力求在两三年内得出结论；在黄河流域要特别注意减少泥沙的影响和作用。提倡各社、各乡自搞简易的水文、气象观测，今年打下基础，以后继续发展。在北方有盐渍化威胁的地区，还要随时注意土壤盐分的测验工作。
    在今冬明春，以至今后几年内，除了还要大量发展小型水利工程以外，对已完成的小型工程，还有许多事情要做。已成的小型工程，需要继续整修、加固，提高标准。已经提高标准的工程，也要经常防护，每年维修，保证效益。鱼鳞坑需要种上树，维护好，一直到山坡绿化为止。山区、丘陵区地边埂需要继续加工，一直到梯田化为止。水井水塘需要解决提水工具，每个灌溉工程都要做到引水浇地为止。
    有些地区已开始修建中型工程，这类中型工程将会继续加多。群众在掌握了小型工程的技术以后，完全有条件进一步掌握中型工程的技术。由于中型工程一般地规模较大，技术较复杂，万一出事，利害关系也较大，在群众初办中型工程时期，我们应当积极加强技术指导，力求保证中型工程的安全。
    在发展各种小型工程的同时，还要提倡大量举办小型水力发电站。在规划思想上，要提倡尽量利用水能来发电。如果发电条件还不具备，可以而且应当提倡直接利用水能进行农副业产品加工和灌溉等等。建设水电站首先要解决水轮机和发电机的制造问题。我们提议，中小型水轮机和发电机尽量由群众和地方自造。
    需要更大的跃进
    在当前水利建设新形势的基础上，在第二个五年计划中，水利建设应当也可能有一个更大的跃进。我国是一个水利资源丰富而水旱灾害又很严重的国家。几年来的经验证明，水利是农业的命脉，要保证农业增产，必须搞好水利。在广大人民的要求和努力下，第二个五年计划之内基本上消灭普通水旱灾害，提前完成农业发展纲要中的要求，这是完全可以做到的。我国水力资源居世界第一位，并且有优越的开发条件，在消灭普通水旱灾害同时，水力资源的开发，应当成为水利建设中的重要方面。可以预期，在大规模水利建设的基础上，一个大规模的水电建设高潮必会到来。我们应当从各方面促进这个高潮的到来，大力转变水电资源开发落后的状态，在第二个五年计划末，争取做到水火电装机容量基本相等，以便尽快实现中央提出的电力建设中以水电为主、火电为辅的方针，并为十五年内在电力方面赶上英国打下基础。
    在第二个五年计划期间，我们对江河治理与开发、电力建设、灌溉等方面作了以下的安排：
    对于松花江、辽河、海河、黄河、淮河、长江、珠江的治理与开发，应该吸取几年来水利建设的经验，特别是去冬今春群众性水利建设高潮的经验，采取干支流、上中下游、大中小型结合，点线面结合，防洪、发电、灌溉、航运综合开发的办法进行规划与治理。在中央地方密切结合并更多地依靠地方的条件下，争取在第二个五年计划期间基本上消灭普通洪水的灾害，更多地发展灌溉与水电。全国其他中小河流由各省分别进行治理，也争取在第二个五年计划期间消灭普通的洪水灾害。
    长江的治理与开发，我们将坚决根据中央决议，积极研究与解决修建三峡枢纽的各种问题，并按期提出设计。对于长江流域的各支流，凡是条件成熟的，都应积极兴建水库与水电站。对于长江的特大洪水，在三峡工程兴建以前，应积极找出各种办法加以防止。
    在发展灌溉方面，主要依靠群众性水利运动，结合必要的大中型工程，扩大灌溉面积七亿亩，这样到1962年我们将有十二亿亩的水田和水浇地，约占耕地面积的70％以上，基本实现水利化，消灭普通旱灾。中国的水量分布是不平衡的，长江流域及长江以南地区水量丰富，用在灌溉上是有剩余的；淮河流域特别是黄河以北及西北地区水量不足，发展灌溉受到限制，特别是大量发展水稻受到限制。因此，在第二个五年计划期间应认真研究长江汉水向北引水的问题。地下水和自流井问题，也要进行研究。
    在水土保持方面，要求完成一百万平方公里的面积，到1962年将有一百二十万平方公里水土流失面积得到初步控制，约占水土流失面积的80％（全国水土流失面积约一百五十万平方公里）。
    在治涝方面，结合大量发展水稻，要求完成三亿三千万亩，到1962年共完成治涝面积四亿二千万亩，基本上解决沥涝问题。
    在第二个五年计划增建的电站中，应争取水电占总数的一半左右。在农村水电方面，争取发展装机容量达到三百万瓩以上的水电站，实现这一指标，必须贯彻小型为主、社办为主、为生产服务为主、结合照明的方针。
    要实现水利建设的以上任务，关键问题是认真学习和贯彻中央提出的社会主义建设总路线，走水利建设的“蓄、小、群”为主的道路。从过去的工作教训中，我们深深体会到，我们的思想水平还很低，在执行中央的方针路线上带有盲目性，在思想上受到很多教条主义和经验主义的束缚。因此，认真学习毛主席的思想，认真学习辩证法与唯物论，求得共产主义的思想解放，这是做好今后工作的主要关键。在工作方法上，要认真搞试验田，发现典型，总结典型，运用典型以及组织参观来指导工作。
    要走群众路线，就必须更多地依靠地方，坚决贯彻中央与地方相结合的方针。凡是地方能办的事，应该交给地方办；凡是群众能办的事，应该放手交给群众办；他们会办得更多、更快、更好、更省。今年的水利运动就是证明。为了使地方能多办一些事情，还必须帮助地方和群众解决困难问题，主要是帮助地方解决技术力量问题，做到一般的水利、水电工程，各省都能自己设计、自己施工。我们准备在最近将属于水利电力部的设计、施工力量加以调整，下放一大部分支援技术力量薄弱和任务特别重的地区，并且积极帮助各省订出发展和充实水利、水电力量的方案。
    为了贯彻进一步依靠地方、依靠群众的精神，还必须打破一些不合理的规章制度。我们过去对流域规划和设计文件，规定的内容过多，应该精简。对设计文件的审批也抓得太多。我们希望国家计委和经委修改基建工程限额的规定，将审批工作更多地下放到省。另外，还有许多财务制度，也规定得过严过死，使基层单位无法主动工作，甚至各省、各部也无法主动解决问题，限制了各方面的积极性，这些不合理的规章制度应该加以改革。
    我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，水利事业提前实现四十条纲要的要求，电力建设提前赶上英国是完全可以办到的。
