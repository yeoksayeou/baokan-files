Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: Shandong Province's million-strong army of locust eradicators is engaged in a fierce battle day and night in all locust-affected areas.

Due to the impact of last year's drought and flood disasters and the climatic conditions of last winter and this spring, Shandong Province is experiencing particularly severe outbreaks of insect pests this year, including locusts, cotton aphids, and corn borers, the likes of which have not been seen in over a decade. With the state providing substantial support in the form of drugs and equipment and continuously dispatching aircraft to assist, by early June, the province had eliminated summer locusts on more than 4,140,000 mu of land.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee believe that while the achievements in pest control in most parts of the province are significant, some areas are still paralyzed in the face of the major enemy, the investigation of insect conditions is not keeping up, and pest control actions are not forceful enough. To this end, an urgent notice was issued on June 16: First, all areas where insect pests have occurred must be immediately mobilized, led by the secretary, with dedicated personnel in charge, to strengthen investigation. All locust-affected areas should strive to completely eliminate locusts within a week, and the locust nymphs that have emerged must be resolutely prevented from taking flight and causing harm. Second, fully unleash the creativity of the masses, continuously summarize the masses' inventions and creations of pesticides and agricultural machinery, and new pest control methods, and promptly convene on-site meetings to promote them; promote the spirit of communism, break down the boundaries of townships and communes, organize joint prevention and control, and leave no safe haven for insect pests. Third, promptly do a good job in the supply and repair of pesticides and agricultural machinery, and pay attention to summarizing and promoting the masses' local experiences and methods to overcome the difficulties of lacking drugs and equipment. Fourth, through this year's pest control campaign, establish a network of pest control intelligence and research, and focus on studying effective methods to completely eliminate pests and diseases.

    山东百万灭蝗大军日夜激战
    省委要求在一周内全部消灭蝗虫
    据新华社济南19日电　山东省百万灭蝗大军，日夜在各蝗区展开激战。
    由于去年水旱灾害和去冬今春气候条件的影响，山东省今年发生蝗虫、棉蚜、玉米螟等虫害的现象特别严重，为近十余年来所未有。在国家以大量药物、药械支援和连续派飞机协助下，到6月上旬，全省已在四百一十四万余亩土地上消灭了夏蝗。
    中共山东省委和省人民委员会认为，全省大部地区防治虫害的成绩是很大的，但仍有部分地区面临大敌而思想麻痹，对虫情的侦查工作跟不上，防治行动尚不够有力。为此，特于6月16日发出紧急通知：一、凡已发生虫害的地区，需立即动员起来，由书记挂帅，专人负责，加强侦查。所有蝗区应争取在一周内全面消灭，已发生的蝗蝻，坚决保证使之不起飞，不为害。二、充分发挥群众的创造性，随时总结群众对农药、农械的发明创造和防治的新办法，及时召开现场会议加以推广；发扬共产主义精神，打破乡、社界线，组织联防联治，不给虫害以任何安全落脚的余地。三、及时做好农药、农械的供应和修配工作，并注意总结推行群众的土经验和土办法，克服药械缺乏的困难。四、通过今年防治虫害的运动，建立一个防治虫害的情报和研究网，集中研究彻底消灭病虫害的有效办法。
