Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: "Rural Sichuan has been poeticized." Today, no matter where you go, you can see a dazzling array of poetic verses along the edges of fields, on walls, between mountain rocks, and on tree trunks. Farmers in Gulin County alone have created as many as 100,000 folk songs of various kinds.

There aren't just dozens, or even hundreds, of talented folk singers like "Li Youcai." In Yibin and Gulin counties alone, there are more than 8,000 folk song teams and mountain song creation groups formed by farmers. In many places, not only can farmers compose and sing, but many district and township cadres, CCP district committee secretaries, and county committee secretaries are also active participants in folk song creation. Among these singers are young adults, old farmers, women, and children. The Old Farmer Mountain Song Team, organized by ten old farmers in the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative of Hedong Township, Suining County, has a history of more than four years. They have written hundreds of mountain songs, and they compose songs for almost every task the cooperative undertakes.

Closely integrating with production and various central tasks, and possessing a strong ideological and militant nature, is an important feature of Sichuan farmers' poetry creation. They create on a wide variety of subjects, singing about whatever they are currently doing; not only expressing emotions and determination to fight against nature, but also praising good people and good deeds, and criticizing backwardness. They write poetry on field ridges, mountain rocks, and all other eye-catching places. In many areas such as Neijiang and Guanghan, farmers also insert many production mobilization signs in the fields, writing newly composed poems on the mobilization signs, and some even write songs on farm tools.

    田埂边，墙壁上，诗句琳琅满目
    四川农村已经诗化了
    据新华社成都电　“四川农村已经诗化了。”今天，无论走到哪个地方，田埂边，墙壁上，山岩间，树干上都可以看见琳琅满目的诗句。仅古蔺县农民创作的各种歌谣，就有十万首之多。
    像“李有才”那样有才能的民间歌手，不是几十人，甚或几百人。只是宜宾、古蔺两县，农民组成的民歌队和山歌创作小组就在八千个以上。许多地方不仅农民能编会唱，不少区乡干部、中共区委书记和县委书记也是创作民歌的积极分子。这些歌手中，有青壮年，有老农民，有妇女，也有儿童。遂宁县河东乡红光农业社十个老农组织的老农山歌队，已有四年多历史，他们编写的山歌数以百计，几乎社里开展每一项工作，他们都编成山歌唱起来。
    紧密结合生产和各项中心工作，具有强烈的思想性和战斗性，是四川农民诗歌创作的一个重要特色。他们创作的题材多种多样，当前作什么就唱什么；不仅抒发情感，表示同自然作斗争的决心，还表扬好人好事，批评落后。他们把诗歌写在田埂、山岩等一切惹人注目的地方。内江、广汉等不少地区农民还在田间插上许多生产鼓动牌，把新作的诗歌写在鼓动牌上，有的还把歌谣写在农具上。
