Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th. China's first modern Harbin Electrical Carbon Factory officially started production yesterday.

The completion and start of production of the Harbin Electrical Carbon Factory will fundamentally change the situation of China's dependence on foreign imports for electrical carbon products. It marks another major victory for China's industry in moving towards independence, self-reliance, and comprehensive development.

At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the State Acceptance Committee held a signing ceremony for the acceptance. Guo Weiren, the director of the committee, read out the acceptance appraisal of the construction project, stating that the overall quality of the entire factory's project was rated as excellent, and all production preparation conditions were ready for official production. In the afternoon, a grand celebration of the opening ceremony was held. At the meeting, Deputy Director Lü Jike presented banners and souvenirs to the Soviet experts stationed at the factory on behalf of all the employees, expressing their gratitude.

The Harbin Electrical Carbon Factory was built in two phases. The first phase of the project officially started on March 8, 1956, and was completed six months ahead of schedule. By adopting the method of simultaneous construction, trial production, and production, it has successfully trial-produced 18 kinds of products during the construction process, supplying many factories and mining enterprises.

The second phase of the factory's expansion project will officially start in early next year and will be completed in 1960.

The Harbin Electrical Carbon Factory received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in terms of design, construction, and production. The Soviet government sent excellent experts in construction, installation, and production preparation to the factory to help and guide, and also trained a large number of engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers for the factory.

    电碳制品依赖进口的局面将根本改变
    新建哈尔滨电碳厂投入生产
    据新华社哈尔滨29日电　我国第一座现代化的哈尔滨电碳厂昨天正式开工生产。
    哈尔滨电碳厂的建成和开工生产，将根本改变我国在电碳制品方面依赖国外进口的局面，它标志着我国工业走向独立自主、全面发展的又一重大胜利。
    昨天上午九时，国家验收委员会举行了验收签字仪式。主任委员郭伟人宣读了建设工程验收鉴定书，认为全厂工程质量总评为优，各项生产准备条件已经具备，可以正式投入生产。下午，举行庆祝开工生产典礼大会。会上，副厂长吕纪柯代表全厂职工向驻厂苏联专家献锦旗和纪念品，表示感谢。
    哈尔滨电碳厂分两期建成。第一期工程在1956年3月8日正式开工，提前半年建成。由于采取了边建设、边试制、边生产的办法，它已经在建设过程中试制成功十八种产品，供给许多厂矿企业。
    这个厂的第二期扩建工程将在明年初正式开工，1960年建成。
    哈尔滨电碳厂从设计、施工到生产，都得到了苏联全面的、无私的援助。苏联政府派来了优秀的建筑、安装、生产准备等专家驻厂帮助和指导，并且为这个厂培养了大批工程技术人员和技术工人。
