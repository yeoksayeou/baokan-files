Agricultural Cooperatives Must and Can Run Science
Yexian Xianfeng Cooperative Popularizes Scientific Research

(This newspaper dispatch) The question of whether agricultural production cooperatives should engage in scientific research, whether they can engage in scientific research, and how they should engage in scientific research has been given clear and affirmative answers by the on-site conference held by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yexian Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative.

Representatives from Shandong Province and other provinces attended this on-site conference. Representatives from central government agencies such as the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, the Academy of Sciences, and the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization also attended the conference.

Many representatives said that arriving at the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative was like entering a natural science palace. In the fields, the representatives discovered that the land here was being utilized very fully, treating each mu of land as if it were several mu. In the universally densely planted wheat fields, it was difficult to see the ground unless one used both hands to separate the dense wheat stalks. In a spring field of just over two mu, ten kinds of crops, including corn, sweet potatoes, millet, potatoes, peanuts, and sesame, were growing simultaneously. According to reliable calculations, the yield of grain per mu could reach 3,710 jin, and an additional 2,000 jin of vegetables could also be harvested.

What marks the level of scientific research of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative is their series of experimental fields. The various experiments on wheat are quite systematic and complete, and the experimental methods and procedures are up to standard. When representatives from various places came to visit, two young women under the age of twenty carefully introduced to everyone the purpose and method of these experiments and their effect on the production of the entire cooperative. A representative of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization said that he had traveled to several provinces and had not seen such a formal experimental field. Hua Shan, vice president of Shandong Agricultural College, the head of the provincial agricultural science research department, and other experts and professors gave a fairly high evaluation of the level of agricultural scientific experimental research work of this cooperative. Qin Xican, director of the Biology Department of Shandong Normal College, believed that the in-depth and systematic explanation of the experimental fields by several young female technicians was like a valuable and vivid scientific report.

In the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative, the representatives also saw things that some people in the past thought should not be done and could not be done in agricultural cooperatives. In terms of wheat hybridization, they not only studied and solved the problem of wheat lodging from the aspects of seeds, fertilizers, and watering, but also from the aspect of soil. The courageous exploration and research of this agricultural cooperative on these complex problems has begun to achieve significant results.

The representatives generally praised the more than thirty kinds of tools created and improved by the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative. Particularly fascinating were the machine mill and feed grinder researched and created by the cooperative director Zhang Yongmao and the cooperative members. The stone and wood machine mill they created is equipped with lifting equipment, and the entire production process is mechanized. It can grind 10,000 jin of flour per day and night, freeing up a large number of female laborers and livestock to be invested in agricultural production.

The representatives also visited the rich and colorful exhibition room. This concentrates on the achievements of this agricultural cooperative's scientific research work over the past few years. Various specimens of crops, pests and diseases, and soil collected locally, systematic records reflecting changes in natural conditions such as climate, plus various self-made technical diagrams and materials, constitute a vivid textbook that combines applicable agricultural scientific research with production practice.

When it comes to scientific research, people often think of experts, a large amount of data, and complete sets of instruments and equipment. Several special reports clearly show that the people of Xianfeng Cooperative do not believe in this set of things. As long as production needs it, they are determined to do it and try their best to make it happen. They have not received higher education, but under the leadership of the Party, they have worked hard and studied hard. Since 1954, they have trained a technical team of nearly 200 people, which has become the basic force for research and promotion of new technologies in the entire cooperative. Among them, 27 technicians have reached the level of graduation from a junior agricultural school in theory. They do not have a large number of books, research materials and textbooks, so they combine the lectures of junior agricultural schools, the replies to their questions from relevant research departments, articles in newspapers and magazines, the experience of local old farmers, and their own experiences in practice, learning, doing, and researching. For a considerable period of time, they only had a few thermometers, a wet and dry bulb hygrometer, an ordinary balance, a small magnifying glass, and a few wooden folding rulers, with a total value of no more than twenty yuan.

The spirit of the people of Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative, their vigorous spirit, their high fighting spirit, and their daring to think and do, gave the entire staff a great inspiration and infection. Wang Shuntong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Science Planning Commission of the State Council, spoke at the meeting. Finally, Wang Zhongyin of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China delivered a concluding report on behalf of the Provincial Committee. He pointed out that the practice of Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative is in line with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction. He said that the experience of Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative demonstrates the following basic issues of principle: First, the development of production inevitably brings about the development of science and technology; and only the development of science and technology can further promote and improve production. Second, agricultural cooperatives can and must engage in science. The experience of Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative eloquently proves that with the leadership of the Party and the guidance and help of scientific departments, all agricultural cooperatives have the possibility and conditions to carry out scientific research work quickly, in large quantities, well, and economically. Third, to carry out the technical innovation movement, we must continue to struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas. Fourth, scientific and technological work must adhere to the mass line and be closely integrated with the broad masses of the people. Fifth, scientific research must be combined with production practice and technical education. The agricultural technology night school of Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative is a model of complete integration of theory and practice, popularization and improvement, production and research, cadres and masses, red and expert, etc. Sixth, the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command are the decisive key to the successful realization of the technological revolution.

    农业社必须办科学，能够办科学
    掖县先锋社普及科学研究工作
    本报讯　农业生产合作社要不要搞科学研究？能不能搞科学研究？怎样搞科学研究？中共山东省委最近在掖县先锋农业社召开的现场会议给这几个问题找到了明确、肯定的答案。
    参加这次现场会议的有山东省和其他省的代表、中共中央宣传部、国务院科学规划委员会、科学院、全国科学技术普及协会等中央机关，也都派代表出席了这次会议。
    许多代表说，到了先锋农业社如同进入一座天然的科学宫。在田野里，代表们发现这里的土地被人们利用得非常充分，把每一亩地都当作好几亩来种。普遍密植的麦田，如果不用双手把稠密的麦棵分开，就很难看见地皮。在一块二亩多地的春田里，同时生长着玉米、地瓜、谷子、土豆、花生、芝麻等十种作物，据可靠的计算，每亩粮食产量可以达到三千七百一十斤，另外还可以收获蔬菜二千斤。
    标志着先锋农业社的科学研究水平的，是他们的一系列的试验田。其中关于小麦的各种试验，都做得相当系统、完整，而且在试验方法上、程序上都合乎标准。各地代表前来参观时，由两个不满二十岁的姑娘向大家仔细地介绍了进行这些试验的目的、方法以及它对全社生产所起的作用。全国科学技术普及协会的一位代表说，他跑了好几个省，还没有见过这么正规的试验田。山东农学院副院长华山、省农业科学研究部门的负责人，以及别的专家、教授们，对这个社的农业科学试验研究工作的水平，都给予相当高的评价。山东师范学院生物系主任秦西灿认为，几位女青年技术员对试验田深入系统的讲解，宛如一篇有价值的生动的科学报告。
    在先锋农业社里，代表们还看到了过去有些人认为在农业社不应该办、也没法办的事情。在小麦的杂交方面，他们不仅从种子、肥料、浇水等方面，而且从土壤方面来研究解决小麦倒伏问题等等。这个农业社对于这些复杂问题的勇敢的探索和研究，已经开始取得显著的成效。
    代表们对先锋农业社创造、改良的三十多种工具普遍加以赞扬。特别令人神往的是社主任张永茂同社员们研究创造的机器磨和饲料粉碎机。他们用石头加木头创造的机器磨，装有升降设备，整个生产过程机械化了，它每昼夜可磨粉一万斤，解放出大批的妇女劳力和牲口投入农业生产。
    代表们还参观了丰富多采的展览室。这里集中地表现了这个农业社几年来进行科学研究工作的成果。采自当地的各式各样的农作物、病虫害、土壤等实物标本，反映气候等自然情况变化的系统记录，加上各种自制的技术图解、资料，构成了一部适用的、农业科学研究同生产实践结合的生动的教材。
    一提起科学研究工作，人们往往就想到专家、大量的资料和成套的仪器设备等等。几个专题报告都清楚地表明，先锋社的人们不迷信这一套。只要生产需要，他们就坚决地干，千方百计地把它干成。他们没有受过高等教育，可是他们在党的领导下，自己苦钻、苦学，从1954年到现在已经培养出近二百人的一支技术队伍，成为全社研究和推广新技术的基本力量。其中有二十七名技术员在理论上都达到了初级农业学校毕业的程度。他们没有大批的图书、研究资料和教材，就把初级农业学校的讲义、各有关研究部门对他们所提问题的答复信件、报刊杂志的文章、当地老农的经验和他们自己在实践中的体验综合起来，边学、边做、边研究。在相当长的时间内他们仅有几只温度表、一个干湿球湿度表、一架普通用的天秤、一个小的放大镜，还有几支木制的折尺，总共价值最多不超过二十元。
    先锋农业社的人们这种精神奋发、斗志昂扬、敢想敢做的共产主义风格，给到会的全体人员以极大的启示和感染。国务院科学规划委员会副秘书长王顺桐在会议上讲了话。最后，中共山东省委宣传部王众音代表省委作了总结报告。他指出先锋农业社的做法是合乎党的社会主义建设总路线的精神的。他说，先锋农业社的经验说明了以下几个带有方针性的基本问题：第一，生产的发展必然带来科学技术的发展；也只有科学技术的发展才能进一步推动和提高生产。第二，农业社可以办科学，而且必需办科学。先锋农业社的经验雄辩地证明，有党的领导，有科学部门的指导和帮助，所有的农业社都有可能、有条件把科学研究工作又快、又多、又好、又省地办起来。第三，要开展技术革新运动，就必须继续不断地同右倾保守思想作斗争。第四，科学技术工作要坚持群众路线的方针，同广大群众密切结合。第五，科学研究必须同生产实践、技术教育相结合。先锋农业社的农业技术夜校就是理论与实践、普及与提高、生产与研究、干部与群众、红与专等各方面完全结合起来的典范。第六，党的领导，政治挂帅是技术革命胜利实现的决定关键。
