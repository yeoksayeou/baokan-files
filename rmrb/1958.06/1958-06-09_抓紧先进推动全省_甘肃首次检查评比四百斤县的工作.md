　　Seize the Advanced to Promote the Whole Province
    Gansu Conducts First Inspection and Comparison of Work in Counties Aiming for 400 Jin per Mu
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, 8th) “Victory is in sight, advance bravely, continue to exhaust all means to strive to over fulfill the 400 jin target.” This is the battle cry put forward by the Gansu Provincial Party Committee's recent inspection and comparison group for counties (cities) aiming for 400 jin per mu, during its first inspection and comparison meeting.
    This inspection and comparison lasted for ten days, starting on May 21st and ending on May 30th. Participating in the comparison were the responsible comrades from the Party committees of fifteen counties, including Gangu, Qin'an, Zhuanglang, Linxia, Yumen, and Gangyuan. The meeting adopted a method combining observation, listening, questioning, visiting, and comparison. It listened to reports from the Zhangye Special District, the Linxia Autonomous Prefecture, and the aforementioned fifteen counties. It conducted on-site observations of first, second, and third-class agricultural production cooperatives in seven counties and cities including Qin'an, Zhangjiachuan, Qingshui, Tianshui, Tianshui City, Li County, and Xihe. It inspected mountainous and flat land, as well as upper, middle, and lower-grade crops. It visited more than twenty agricultural production cooperatives and over a hundred peasant households. Finally, a forum and comparison were held in Yanguan, Li County.
    Based on the inspection and reports, the implementation of the plan of the province's thirty-eight counties and cities that plan to achieve 400 jin per mu this year is going well. As long as the work continues to be done well and as long as no major natural disasters are encountered, the 400 jin target can be achieved, and some will even exceed it. In the past few months, cadres and the masses in various counties have done a lot of work to achieve this target and have achieved remarkable results. Taking water, fertilizer, cultivation, and improved agricultural implements and tools as examples, the fifteen counties participating in the comparison had a total of 1.58 million mu of waterlogged land last year, and this year they newly built more than 4.9 million mu, an increase of 210%, and more than half of them have already been irrigated with water. Most areas have generally achieved the application of 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and some areas have applied 20,000 jin, 30,000 jin, or even 50,000 jin, and in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation, renovation of old houses and basic fertilizer construction work have been carried out. Cultivation measures are rich and varied. Generally, good varieties have been widely promoted, seed dressing with pesticides has been carried out, and various new seeding methods have been promoted, such as wide and narrow row dense planting, triangular nest planting, three-layer fertilizer seeding, double-row intercropping, deep plowing and shallow seeding, intercropping, and intercropping again. In particular, the development of "hundred melons, thousand vegetables, and ten thousand bean plants" and the implementation of agroforestry intercropping have been particularly successful. All counties have done a lot of work in improving agricultural implements and tools, and some counties have basically achieved transportation vehicleization and high-lineization, and have basically used walking plows for cultivation. Tianshui County purchased more than 10,000 rubber tubes and many rainmaking devices to solve the problem of artificial rainfall. Judging from the current crop growth, wheat is generally growing well. Preliminary estimates indicate that the yield per mu in Pingliang, Tianshui, and Dingxi counties can reach about 200 jin, and the yield per mu in Linxia and Zhangye counties can reach about 400 jin, greatly exceeding the output of any year since liberation. Autumn crops generally have neat emergence and strong seedlings. A small number of missing seedlings and sparse seedlings have been transplanted, replenished, and intercropped. At present, the first weeding has been completed in most areas, and some have started the second weeding. Many places have transported fertilizer to the fields, and some have built thin manure pits on the edges of the fields, accumulating a large amount of thin manure to prepare for top dressing. The plans of the counties are generally "three irrigations, three fertilizations, and three weedings" for autumn crops, and some are "four irrigations, four fertilizations, and four weedings." 70%-80% of the wheat fields in Tianshui Special District are preparing for replanting, and they are currently actively preparing fertilizer and irrigation facilities. All of this has laid a good foundation for successfully completing or over fulfilling the target of 400 jin per mu.
    The current problem is to overcome the麻痹 complacent and slackening ideology and bureaucracy in leadership, strengthen inspection and comparison, change the phenomenon of insufficient measures and efforts, and continue to encourage cadres and the masses to earnestly do a good job in future irrigation, top dressing, weeding, and field management, expand first-class fields, and reduce or even eliminate third-class fields.
    The meeting believes that the realization of the 400 jin per mu high-yield plan in thirty-eight counties has significant political and economic significance. The cultivated land area of the thirty-eight counties accounts for 41.47% of the total cultivated land area of the province. As long as the 400 jin per mu plan is realized on such a large area, the task of "hard work for three years to change the face of Gansu; struggle for six years to realize the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program" will be realized ahead of schedule, and the dream of the "autumn reckoning faction" will be shattered by brilliant achievements. Therefore, the party leadership at all levels must pay special attention to this struggle task, conscientiously implement the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's Zhuanglang Conference of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort," continue to exhaust all means, and strive to overfulfill the target of more than 400 jin per mu.

　　抓紧先进推动全省
    甘肃首次检查评比四百斤县的工作
    本报兰州8日电　“胜利在望，奋勇前进，继续想尽一切办法，力争超额完成四百斤”。这是中共甘肃省委最近组织的全省四百斤县（市）首次检查评比团进行评比会议提出的战斗口号。
    这次检查评比，从5月21日开始到30日结束，共进行了十天。参加评比的有甘谷、秦安、庄浪、临夏、玉门、港源等十五个县委的负责同志。会议采取看、听、问、访、比相结合的方法，听取了张掖专区、临夏自治州和上述十五个县的汇报，实地观看了秦安、张家川、清水、天水、天水市、礼县、西和等七个县市一、二、三类社，山地川地，上、中、下各类庄稼，访问了二十多个农业生产合作社和一百余户农民，最后在礼县的盐官举行了座谈和评比。
    根据检查和汇报的情况看，全省三十八个今年计划亩产四百斤的县市，执行良好，只要继续作好工作，只要不遭遇特大自然灾害，四百斤指标都可以完成，有些还会超过。在过去几个月里，为了实现这个指标，各县的干部和群众做了很多工作，取得了显著成绩。拿水、肥、耕作和改良农具工具来说，参加评比的十五个县，去年共有水涝地一百五十八万亩，今年新修成四百九十多万亩，增加了210％，并且有一半以上已经灌上了水；多数地区普遍做到了亩施万斤肥，有些地方施肥量达到二万斤，三万斤甚至五万斤，并且又结合积肥进行了翻修旧房和肥料基本建设工作；耕作措施丰富多彩，一般地都普遍推广了良种，进行了药剂拌种，推广了各种新的掠种方法，如宽窄行密植、三角窝种、三层施肥掠种，双行间种、深翻浅种、间种、套种再套种，特别是开展了“百瓜千菜万株豆”，实行林粮间种，成绩很突出。各县在改良农具和工具方面都作了很多工作，有些县已经基本实现了运输车辆化和高线化，实现了耕地基本使用步犁。天水县为了解决人工降雨问题，购买了一万余条胶管和很多降雨器。从目前作物生长情况来看，小麦普遍生长良好，初步估算，平凉、天水、定西各县亩产可达二百斤左右，临夏、张掖各县可达四百斤左右，大大超过了解放以来任何一年的产量。大秋作物一般出苗整齐、幼苗茁壮，少数缺苗和苗稀的都进行了移苗、补苗和间种，目前多数地方头遍草已经锄过，有些已开始锄二遍，不少地方肥料已经运到地头，有的地边修了稀粪坑，积攒了大量稀粪，准备施追肥，各县的计划都是大秋作物“三水三肥三锄”，有的是“四水四肥四锄”。天水专区麦田70％—80％准备复种，目前正在积极准备肥料和灌溉设施，所有这一切就为胜利完成或超额完成亩产四百斤奠定了良好的基础。
    现在的问题是克服领导上的麻痹松劲思想和官僚主义，加强检查评比，改变有些措施和干劲不足的现象，继续鼓足干部与群众的干劲认真作好今后的灌水、追肥、锄草和田间管理工作，扩大一类田，减少以至消灭三类田。
    会议认为：实现三十八个县的亩产四百斤高产计划，有着重大的政治和经济意义。三十八个县的耕地面积占全省总耕地面积的41.47％，只要在这样大的面积上实现亩产四百斤的计划，那么“苦战三年，改变甘肃面貌；奋斗六年，实现农业发展纲要四十条”的任务就将提前实现，“秋后算账派”的梦想，也将会被辉煌成就捣得粉碎。因此，各级党的领导必须特别抓紧这个斗争任务，认真贯彻执行省委庄浪会议十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲的精神，继续想尽一切办法，为超额完成亩产四百斤以上而奋斗。
