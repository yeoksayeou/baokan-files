　　Marx, Engels, and Lenin pointed out many times that the battle cry of the working class should be "continuous revolution." To put forward new revolutionary tasks in a timely manner, so that the revolutionary struggle of the people does not stall midway, so that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people does not cool down due to the interruption of the revolution, and so that the staff of the Party and the state do not become arrogant and senile because they are satisfied with the achievements they have already made.

　　马克思、恩格斯和列宁曾经多次指出，工人阶级的战斗口号应当是“不断革命”。及时地提出新的革命任务，使人民群众的革命斗争不致在中途发生停顿，使人民群众的革命热情不致因为革命的间断而冷却，使党和国家的工作人员不致因为满足于既得的成就而生长起骄气和暮气。
