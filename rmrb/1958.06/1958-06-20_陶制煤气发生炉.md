    Ceramic Gas Generator
    (By our newspaper) The Yixing Ceramics Experimental Workshop in Jiangsu Province has successfully trial-produced a ceramic gas generator.

    The ceramic gas generator is 143 centimeters high and has an inner diameter of 65 centimeters. After being tested by the state-owned Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, the effect is good, with 30 horsepower. It is also easy to ignite and consumes less coal. Each steel gas generator requires more than 1,000 jin of metal materials such as steel, costing more than 900 yuan, while the ceramic gas generator only costs 95 yuan.

    This ceramic gas generator has low shrinkage and fast heat transfer. It will not expand or crack due to sudden changes in temperature. It can completely replace the steel gas generator.

    陶制煤气发生炉
    本报讯　江苏宜兴陶瓷实验工场试制陶器煤气发生炉成功。
    陶制煤气发生炉，高一百四十三公分，内直径六十五公分。经国营无锡柴油机械厂试用，效果良好，有三十马力，而且容易发火，耗煤量也较少，钢铁煤气炉每只要用钢铁等金属材料一千多斤，成本达九百多元，而陶瓷煤气发生炉只要九十五元。
    这种陶制煤气发生炉，收缩性小，传热快，不会因冷热急变发生膨胀、破裂，完全可以代替钢铁煤气发生炉。
