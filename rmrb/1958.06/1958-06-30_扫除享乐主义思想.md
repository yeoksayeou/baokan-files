Sweep Away Hedonistic Thoughts
Sha Ying

    In the heart-to-heart movement among university students, various bourgeois worldviews have been exposed. Among them, a small number of university students have revealed a hedonistic ideology, believing that the purpose of life is to eat, drink, be merry, pursue enjoyment, and just muddle through life. For example, a student at the Postal and Telecommunications Institute said: "A person's life is short, and youth is fleeting, so you should enjoy yourself while you are young." A student at the Petroleum Institute wrote the following poem: "How many years does a person live? Good if you pass seventy; it's really not easy, you should enjoy yourself more." Another student at the Petroleum Institute fantasized about: a comfortable and pleasant living environment in the future, an elegant small house, and a car, sofa, radio, and a beautiful lover, walking in the fields at sunset, leisurely musical dances... A female student at Tsinghua University yearned for: wishing to be an 18th-century aristocratic lady, with white curtains, red roses, reading novels on the balcony, living a gentle and comfortable life. A student at Beijing Normal University fantasized about a life: a room, a pot of tea, an ancient book, a fishing rod. Admiring peach blossoms in March, peonies in May, lotuses in July, and red leaves in August, also appreciating snow and listening to rain. He said: "When I look back on the past when I am about to die, I can say: there is nothing I regret in this life, I have enjoyed all the joys of the world." Some even pursue a dissolute, decadent, and depraved life, they openly say: happiness is "money plus fine wine," "fame and fortune plus love," "material enjoyment plus spiritual pleasure," and so on.
    Although this is not the mental state of most university students today, but only the thoughts of a few university students; but we cannot ignore this kind of thinking, and we must criticize it, because it not only corrodes the souls of some young people, but it also spreads its influence everywhere.
    Hedonistic thinking was nothing strange in the old society. All exploiting classes, whether landlords, bureaucrats, or capitalists, oppressed and exploited the broad masses of working people for the enjoyment of themselves, their families, their descendants, and a small number of people. The source of their happiness was rent and profit, the blood and sweat and tears of the working people; their wealth and glory was the hunger and cold of the poor, the gluttony of a few of them was the bone-sucking of the majority, their "meat rots behind vermillion gates," while on the other hand "frozen bodies lie on the road." At the same time, they regarded this enjoyment as a "sacred right" and tried their best to promote this taken-for-granted idea, constantly spreading their influence, thus infecting many people. But now it is a new society, and the new society does not allow this reactionary thought to exist. As a youth of the new society, if you still miss the old world, preserve the hedonistic thoughts of the exploiting class, let it gnaw at your soul and corrode your life, then that is very wrong.
    We believe that the purpose of life is to serve the people wholeheartedly and strive to realize the great cause of communism. As a university student in the new society, one should be determined to be a servant of the people and a communist fighter. Now in school, we should study hard, strengthen our training, and cultivate ourselves into a person who is both virtuous and talented, both red and expert, so that we can better serve the people in the future. If you are full of these decadent thoughts now, and let your best years be immersed in this spiritual poison, hindering your progress and wasting your precious time, it is such a pity! Especially now, thousands of laboring people, under the slogan of "a few years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness," are actively and selflessly building socialism with the heroic spirit of communist self-sacrifice, they subordinate individual interests and current interests to collective interests and long-term interests, and subordinate individual happiness to the realization of the lofty socialist ideal of all the people. As a university student in the new society, in the face of this great communist torrent, one is indifferent to the soaring energy and heroic spirit of the people, and only dreams of personal enjoyment day and night, thinking that the purpose of life is only to eat, drink, and be merry, only "a room" and "a pot of tea," etc., in contrast, this is simply too pitiful! Too small! Too vulgar!
    The socialist principle of distribution is "to each according to his work," and the state and the people pay each person the remuneration he deserves based on the results of his labor. Of course, everyone can freely dispose of the remuneration they receive to meet the needs of their own and their family's life and spiritual needs. However, bourgeois hedonists are not like this, the enjoyment they pursue, the happiness they fantasize about, is naturally not obtained by their own labor, they hope to rely on others to provide it for nothing, they plan to build their own enjoyment on the suffering of others, that is to say, they still want to be a parasite, and still hope to rely on exploitation, relying on extracting the blood and sweat of the working people to live a leisurely life. This is not only extremely shameful, but also fundamentally impossible today. Because the world today belongs to the working people, the private ownership of all means of production has been basically eliminated, and bourgeois hedonism has no basis for existence. Today, anyone who still fantasizes about that kind of unearned enjoyment, using the blood and sweat of the people to nourish themselves until they are white and tender, is no different from daydreaming.
    Of course, it is not strange that a small number of university students have this kind of thinking now. Because we are still in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, many university students mostly come from exploiting class and petty-bourgeois families, they have been greatly influenced by the old way of life, the old ideology, and the old traditional habits, so they have produced various bourgeois worldviews. The elimination of these various bourgeois worldviews is not so easy, nor can it be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, the ideological remolding of university students is a serious task. However, as a university student, if you do not resolutely carry out self-remolding, seriously criticize and correct those wrong views, accept socialist education, and truly establish a communist worldview, then the future is very dangerous.
    In addition to heart-to-heart talks, criticism, and ideological struggle, reading Marxist-Leninist books and studying socialist education courses are of course also very important for the ideological remolding of bourgeois intellectuals. Only in this way can there be destruction and construction, destruction and prosperity, so that they can realize the reactionary nature of the bourgeois worldview ideologically and theoretically, and thus be determined to abandon this thing and establish a communist worldview. But more importantly, it is necessary to use all opportunities to let them go to practice more, go to the masses more, and temper themselves in the crucible of the class struggle and production struggle of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." (See "The May Fourth Movement") For those who hold a hedonistic worldview, if they can be allowed to go to practice more, to train more among the masses, especially to participate in some labor training, they will gradually feel how ugly their thoughts and feelings are, and how pure and healthy the thoughts and feelings of the working people are; the energy and spirit of the working people will smash their fantasies and dreams like a torrent rushing against stubborn rocks and withered grass.
    Our university students today live in a great era and a happy country. Internationally, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and will continue to prevail over the West Wind in the future. In our country, the socialist revolution has achieved basic victories in the economic, political, and ideological fields. Now China's 600 million people are devoting their main efforts to socialist construction, gradually realizing the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Under the shining of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country are launching a great leap forward in various tasks with unparalleled ambition and overwhelming momentum. We will soon turn our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. In short, the situation both internationally and domestically is bright. Under these circumstances, as a university student—the youngest, most enthusiastic, and most sensitive person—can you not feel encouraged and excited? History has given university students extremely important tasks. Everyone knows that in order to build socialism, in order to realize the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, it is impossible without an army of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals, without a large number of red and expert teams. Today's university students are tomorrow's soldiers and commanders on various construction fronts. Our Party and the people of the whole country place unlimited hopes on them, and wish them to cultivate themselves into people needed by the motherland! Therefore, every university student, under this bright situation, should not fail the expectations of the Party and the people for them, should not waste their time and life, should resolutely sweep away that hedonistic and other various bourgeois worldviews, thoroughly transform their own thinking, cheer up, study diligently, cultivate a noble communist style, and strive to master business and technology, so that they can do more things for the people and contribute more to socialism in the future.

    扫除享乐主义思想
    沙英
    在高等学校学生的交心运动中，暴露了形形色色的资产阶级人生观。其中有少数大学生暴露了一种享乐主义思想，他们认为生活的目的就是吃喝玩乐，追求享受，马马虎虎过一辈子了事。例如：邮电学院有一个学生说：“一个人的生命是短促的，青春一去不复返，要趁年青时代好好享受一番。”石油学院有一个学生写了这样一首诗：“人生年几何，好者七十过；实在不容易，应该多享乐。”石油学院另一个学生的幻想是：将来有一个安逸舒适的生活环境，雅致的小洋房，还有汽车、沙发、收音机和漂亮的爱人，夕阳斜照时的田间散步，音乐悠闲的舞会……。清华大学的一个女学生所向往的是：愿作一个十八世纪的贵族小姐，白窗帘、红玫瑰，在阳台上看小说，过着温柔舒适的生活。北京师范学院有一个学生所幻想的生活是：一间房，一壶茶，一本古书，一个钓鱼竿。三月看桃花，五月看牡丹，七月看荷花，八月看红叶，还要赏雪、听雨。他说：“当我临死前回首往事时，我可以说：这一生对我来说是没有什么遗憾的了，人间一切欢乐我都享受了。”甚至还有人追求一种放荡、糜烂、颓废的生活，他们公开地说：幸福就是“金钱加美酒”，“名利加爱情”，“物质享受加精神快乐。”如此等等。
    虽然这不是今天大多数大学生的精神状态，而仅是少数大学生的思想情况；但是对于这种思想我们不能忽视，不能不加以批判，因为它不仅腐蚀着一部分青年人的灵魂，而且它还四处散布着它的影响。
    享乐主义思想，在旧社会中那是没有什么希奇的。所有的剥削阶级，不问地主、官僚和资本家，都是为了他们个人、家族、后世子孙和一少部分人的享乐，而压迫着、剥削着广大的劳动人民。他们幸福的源泉，是地租和利润，是劳动人们的血汗和眼泪；他们的荣华富贵就是穷人的饥寒交迫，他们少数人的脑满肠肥就是大多数人的被敲骨吸髓，他们的“朱门酒肉臭”，另一方面就是“路有冻死骨”。同时，他们把这种享受看作是“神圣的权利”，并且极力宣传着这种视为当然的思想，不断地散播着他们的影响，因此也就使许多人受了感染。可是现在是新社会了，新社会是不容许这种反动思想存在的。作为一个新社会的青年，如果仍然留恋着旧的世界，保存着剥削阶级的享乐主义思想，让它啃啮着自己的灵魂，腐蚀着自己的生命，那就是很错误的了。
    我们认为，人生的目的就是全心全意为人民服务，为实现伟大的共产主义而奋斗。作为一个新社会的大学生，立志要做一个人民的勤务员，做一个共产主义的战士。现在在学校中应当努力学习，加强锻炼，把自己培养成为一个才德兼备的、又红又专的人，将来才能更好地为人民服务。如果现在满脑子装着这些腐朽的思想，让大好年华浸沉在这种精神的毒剂之中，阻碍自己的进步，浪费宝贵的光阴，那是多么可惜！特别是现在，千千万万的劳动人民，在“几年辛苦，万年幸福”的口号下，正以共产主义的自我牺牲的英雄气概，积极地、忘我地建设着社会主义，他们把个人利益和目前利益依存于集体利益和长远利益，把个人幸福依存于全体人民的社会主义崇高理想的实现。作为一个新社会的大学生，在这种伟大的共产主义洪流面前，对于人民群众的这种冲天干劲和英雄气概竟然无动于衷，而日夜梦寐以求的仅仅是个人的一点享受，认为生活的目的只是吃喝玩乐，只是“一间房”、“一壶茶”等等，相形之下，这简直是太可怜了！太渺小了！太庸俗了！
    社会主义的分配原则是“按劳取酬”，国家和人民根据每一个人的劳动成果而付给他应得的报酬。当然，每一个人对于所得的报酬，可以自由支配，来满足自己、家庭的生活需要和精神需要。但是，资产阶级的享乐主义者却不是这样，他们所追求的享受，他们所幻想的幸福，自然是不以自己的劳动而得来的，是希望靠别人白白供给的，是打算把自己的享受建筑在别人的痛苦之上的，这就是说他们还要当一个寄生虫，还企望依靠剥削、依靠榨取劳动人民的血汗来过着优哉游哉的生活。这不仅是极为可耻的，而且在今天也是根本不可能的了。因为今日之天下已是劳动人民的天下，一切生产资料的私有制已经基本上消灭了，资产阶级的享乐主义已没有存在的基础了。在今天谁如果还幻想着那种不劳而获的享受，用人民的血汗把自己养得又白又嫩，那无异是白日做梦。
    当然，现在有少数大学生存在着这种思想也不是什么奇怪的事情。因为我们现在还处于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，许多大学生大都出身于剥削阶级和小资产阶级的家庭，他们从旧的生活方式、旧的意识形态和旧的传统习惯中受到了很大的影响，所以便产生了各种各样的资产阶级的人生观。这些各种各样的资产阶级人生观的扫除，并不是那么容易的，也不是短时期内就可以完成的。因此，对于大学生的思想改造，便是一个严重的任务。可是，作为一个大学生来说，如果不坚决地进行自我改造，认真批判和改正那些错误观点，接受社会主义教育，真正树立起共产主义的人生观，那末前途是非常危险的。
    资产阶级知识分子的思想改造，除了交心、开展批评、开展思想斗争以外，当然阅读马克思列宁主义书籍、学习社会主义教育课程也是很重要的。只有这样，才能有破有立，有灭有兴，使他们从思想上、理论上认识到资产阶级人生观的反动性，从而下决心抛弃这种东西和树立共产主义的人生观。但是更重要的，是要利用一切机会，让他们多到实际中去，多到群众中去，在群众的阶级斗争和生产斗争的熔炉中锻炼锻炼。毛泽东同志说：知识分子如果不与工农群众相结合，则将一事无成。“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”（见“五四运动”）对于那些抱有享乐主义人生观的人来说，如果能让他们多到实际中去看看，多到群众中锻炼一下，特别是能多参加一些劳动锻炼，他们就会逐渐感到他们的思想感情是如何的丑恶，劳动人民的思想感情是如何的纯洁和健康；劳动人民的那种干劲和气概，就会像汹涌的洪流冲击顽石和枯草一样，把他们的那些幻想和梦呓打得粉碎。
    我们的大学生，今天是生活在一个伟大的时代和幸福的国度里。在国际上是东风压倒西风，而且今后将继续压倒西风。在我们国内，社会主义革命不论在经济上、政治上和思想上，都已经取得了基本的胜利。现在我国六亿人民正以主要的力量从事社会主义建设，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀之下，全国人民，正以无比的雄心和排山倒海之势，掀起了各种工作的大跃进。我们将很快地把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。总之，不论国际国内的形势，都是一片光明。在这种情况下面，作为一个大学生——最年轻最热情而又最富于敏感的人，能不感到鼓舞和振奋吗？历史赋予大学生的任务是极其重大的。大家都知道，为了建设社会主义，为了实现技术革命和文化革命，没有一支千万人的工人阶级的知识分子大军，没有一大批红色专家的队伍，那是不行的。今天的大学生，就是明天的各个建设战线上的战士和指挥员。我们党和全国人民对于他们寄予无限的希望，愿他们把自己培养成一个祖国所需要的人！因此，每一个大学生，在这一片光明的形势之下，不应辜负党和人民对于他们的期望，不应浪费自己的光阴和生命，要坚决扫除那种享乐主义以及其他形形色色的资产阶级的人生观，彻底改造自己的思想，振作起来，刻苦钻研，培养崇高的共产主义的风格，努力掌握业务和技术，以便将来为人民多做一些事情，为社会主义多贡献一点力量。
