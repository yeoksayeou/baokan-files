	Notes
	The Lie Exposed
	Macmillan once again harped on the old tune of "mutual dependence" in the United States this time, even saying, "The understanding and friendship between Britain and the United States has reached a very high level today."

	But unfortunately, the day before Macmillan's speech, the British "Daily Mail" revealed a piece of news: the United States and Britain had a dispute over the exchange of atomic intelligence, and the differences were quite "serious." It is said that the United States wanted Britain to provide information on atomic power stations, but Britain felt that providing such secret information to the United States without getting "royalties" would be "breaking its promise" and refused to hand it over.

	In the beginning, when the United States and Britain were touting their "mutual dependence," they used the exchange of atomic secrets as a remarkable sign of this, but after more than half a year of blowing their own horns, no intelligence was exchanged, and it turned into a "mutual struggle" between the United States and Britain. In fact, "cooperation" between imperialists is inherently deceitful and exploitative. However, this matter is a good satire of Macmillan's words.
	Weapons and Evidence
	At a press conference on the 10th, Dulles falsely accused the United Arab Republic of "interfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon." He also said pretentiously, "There is increasing evidence that this riot (Dulles's false accusation against the Lebanese uprising) is also aided by the actual supply of military equipment and ammunition."

	Dulles is accustomed to distorting the facts, and this time is no exception. The Chamoun government in Lebanon is completely isolated among the Lebanese people, and what sustains its life is the real intervener - the United States itself.

	It is certainly very reasonable for the Cairo "Al-Ahram" to ask this question: Why doesn't Dulles provide these evidences to Chamoun, but instead provides him with various light and heavy weapons?

    札记
    牛皮戳穿
    麦克米伦这次在美国又一次大弹“互相依靠”的老调，还说什么：“英美之间的谅解和友谊今天已达到了很高的水平”。
    可是事不凑巧，在麦克米伦演说前一天，英国“每日邮报”却透露了一则消息：美英在交换原子情报问题上发生了争吵，而且分歧还相当“严重”。据说是因为美国要英国提供原子发电站的情报，但是英国感到提供给美国这样秘密的情报却捞不到“特许权使用费”，因此“背弃诺言”不肯拿出来了。
    想当初美、英大吹大擂他们的“互相依靠”时，曾经把交换原子秘密情报当作这方面的一个了不起的标志，但是，吹了半年多，结果情报一个也没交换，而且变成了美英的一场“互相角斗”。其实帝国主义间的“合作”本来就是尔虞我诈，互相利用而已。不过这件事情对于麦克米伦的话倒是一个很好的讽刺。
    武器和证据
    杜勒斯在10日的记者招待会上，诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国“对黎巴嫩内政进行了干涉”，他还像煞有介事地说，“还得到越来越多的证据证明，这次暴乱行动（杜勒斯对黎巴嫩起义人民的诬称）还由于实际供应军事装备和弹药而得到帮助”。
    杜勒斯惯于颠倒黑白，这次也不例外。黎巴嫩的夏蒙政府在黎巴嫩人民中间已经完全孤立，维系它的生命的是真正的干涉者——美国自己。
    开罗“金字塔报”提出这样的问题当然是十分有道理的：杜勒斯为什么不向夏蒙提供这些证据，反而向他提供各种轻重武器呢？
