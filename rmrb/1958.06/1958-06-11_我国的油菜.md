Data:

    Rapeseed is one of China's major oil crops. The national planting area is about 40 million mu, accounting for about 30% of the total area of oil crops (excluding soybeans).

    Except for the Northeast region, rapeseed is cultivated in other provinces and regions of China. Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi are more concentrated in planting. According to the cultivation season, the area south of the Yellow River Basin is the winter-sown rapeseed area, and most areas of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces (regions) are spring-sown rapeseed areas. Winter-sown rapeseed areas account for more than 90% of the total rapeseed area.

    Winter rapeseed is sown in autumn and winter and harvested in summer, which can make full use of idle winter land and increase the multiple cropping index. Spring rapeseed is sown in spring and summer and harvested in autumn, once a year.

    Rapeseed has extremely high utilization value. Rapeseed oil is mainly used for edible purposes, and can also be used as paint, synthetic rubber, and other industrial raw materials. The oil cake left over from oil extraction is a very good fertilizer and can also be used as feed.

    Calculating one mu of rapeseed to produce 100 jin of rapeseed, in addition to extracting about 35 jin of oil, 65 jin of oil cake can also be obtained. These oil cakes, combined with other fertilizers, can also meet the fertilization needs of one mu of land.

    From the perspective of yield per unit area, rapeseed also has great potential for increased production. In 1957, the average yield of rapeseed was about 50 jin per mu, which is only half of the common high yield in large areas. A large area yield of 100 jin of rapeseed per mu has been achieved in the past, and even more so this year. Taking Hunan Province as an example, there are 119 townships and 1,340 agricultural cooperatives in the province with a rapeseed yield of over 100 jin per mu.

    我国的油菜
    油菜是我国主要油料作物之一，全国播种面积约达四千万亩，占油料作物总面积30％左右（不包括大豆）。
    除东北地区以外，我国其他省区都有油菜的栽培，四川、贵州、云南、湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏、浙江、陕西等省种植比较集中。按照栽培季节区分，黄河流域及其以南的地区是冬播油菜地区，内蒙古、青海、新疆和甘肃、山西、河北等省（区）大部分地区为春播油菜区。冬播油菜区占油菜总面积90％以上。
    冬油菜，秋、冬播种，夏季收获，可以充分利用冬闲土地，增加复种指数。春油菜，春、夏季播种，秋季收获，一年一熟。
    油菜子的利用价值极高。菜油主要作为食用，也可以作为油漆、人造橡胶和其他工业原料。榨油剩下的油饼，是很好的肥料，也可以作为饲料。
    一亩油菜以产菜子一百斤计算，除榨油三十五斤左右外，还可得六十五斤油饼。这些油饼，配上别的肥料，又可以满足一亩田的施肥需要。
    从单位面积产量看，油菜的增产潜力也是很大的。1957年油菜子的平均亩产量五十斤左右，只及常见的大面积较高产量的一半。大面积亩产菜籽百斤，过去有过，今年更多。以湖南一省说，全省有一百一十九个乡、一千三百四十个社亩产菜籽百斤以上。
