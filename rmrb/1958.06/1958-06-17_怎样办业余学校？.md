How to Run a Spare-Time School?
    Lin Mo

    One steel factory's spare-time school did not closely integrate education with production. Students learned "ratio," but when they needed to use ratio to convert gears in production, they still didn't know how to apply it. This is the result of teaching being divorced from practical production. Another steel plant's spare-time school, on the other hand, integrated teaching with the actual steelmaking production, teaching chemistry. Steelworkers then applied chemical principles to grasp the chemical changes inside the steelmaking furnace, improving production. The same schools, the same time spent, but the results of the two teaching methods are vastly different.

    Different teaching methods come from different teaching ideologies: the former teaches for the sake of teaching, or to make the spare-time school catch up with regular middle schools. In short, they pay little attention to what workers urgently want to learn and what needs to be taught in conjunction with practical production needs. The latter clarifies that education should serve production and teaches what is needed for the job. Therefore, they can closely integrate with production at any time.

    Shanghai's vocational spare-time education is beginning a major reform to eliminate the past educational ideology and teaching methods that were divorced from reality and production, and to establish educational ideologies and teaching methods that proceed from reality and serve production. The result of this reform will inevitably bring about a new leap forward in vocational spare-time education there.

    Currently, two things being done in Shanghai's vocational spare-time education are very important. First, they are working on compiling teaching materials that are combined with production, making it easier for workers to understand and apply in practice. Modern industrial production is based on scientific principles. In the past, the working class lacked the conditions to learn culture. They have repeatedly practiced various production operations thousands of times, but only knew what to do but not why. If the various production processes of the workers' actual operations are thoroughly explained with scientific principles, the workers will suddenly understand and infer other things from one instance. This will arouse a strong interest in learning. Second, they are working on adjusting study time and study forms. The flexibility and diversity of learning organizations will facilitate the absorption of more workers to participate in various learning organizations that suit them for learning.

    Teaching combined with production and serving production, so that workers use the scientific culture they have learned to improve production, greatly contributes to technological revolution and cultural revolution, promoting the great development of productive forces. This approach greatly increases the enthusiasm of workers to learn and the enthusiasm of factories and mines to run schools, and more spare-time schools that meet the needs of production and workers will be further developed on a large scale.

    Serving production through teaching is the fundamental principle of education work. Any school that implements this principle can achieve a vigorous development, otherwise, it will be run in a deserted manner.

    怎样办业余学校？
    林沫
    有一个钢铁工厂的业余学校，教育和生产没有密切结合，学员学了“比例”，但是在生产中换算齿轮用到比例的时候，仍然不会运用。这是教学脱离生产实际的结果。另一个炼钢厂的业余学校，教学结合炼钢生产实际，教了化学，炼钢工人就根据化学原理，掌握炼钢炉内的化学变化，改进和提高了生产。同样办学校，同样花时间，两种教学方法，其结果，悬殊很大。
    不同的教学方法，来自不同的教学思想：前一种是为了教学而教学，或者是为了使业余学校赶上正规中学而教学。总之，他们对工人迫切希望学什么，结合生产实际需要教什么，是不大过问的。另一种是明确了教育要为生产服务，作什么教什么，因此，能够随时密切结合生产。
    上海的职工业余教育开始进行大改革，要革掉过去那种脱离实际、脱离生产的教育思想和教学方法，树立从实际出发、为生产服务的教育思想和教学方法。这样改革的结果，必然会给那里的职工业余教育带来一个大跃进的新局面。
    目前，上海职工业余教育所进行的两件事，是很重要的。第一，他们正着手结合生产编写教材，使职工学习起来容易理解，能够实际运用。现代化的工业生产，是以科学原理为依据的。过去工人阶级缺乏学习文化的条件，他们在生产操作中，自己千百次地反复作过了，但只知其然而不知其所以然。如果把工人实际操作的各种生产过程用科学原理加以透彻的讲解，工人就会豁然贯通，举一反三。学习的时候就会引起浓厚的学习兴趣。第二，他们正着手调整学习时间和学习形式。学习组织的灵活多样，就便利于吸收更多的职工，参加各种适合自己的学习组织进行学习。
    结合生产进行教学，为生产服务，职工把所学的科学文化用之于提高和改进生产，这又大大有助于技术革命和文化革命，促使生产力的大发展。这种作法，工人学习的积极性，厂矿办学的积极性都会大大提高，更多的适应生产和工人需要的业余学校就会进一步大量发展。
    教学为生产服务，是教育工作的根本方针。任何学校，贯彻这个方针，就能得到轰轰烈烈的发展，否则，就会办得冷冷清清。
