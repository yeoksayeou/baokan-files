　　Lebanese War Situation and Geographical Situation
    The Lebanese people's uprising against imperialism and its agent, the Chamoun regime, began on May 9th and has now persisted for more than twenty days. Initially, the struggle took the form of mass demonstrations, general strikes, and general market strikes; under the suppression of the Lebanese government, the struggle quickly turned into an armed uprising by the people. U.S. imperialism openly interfered in Lebanon's internal affairs, shipping weapons to the pro-Western Lebanese government in a steady stream. Americans took on the task of piloting aircraft to bomb the insurgents. U.S. and British fleets sailed to intimidate the Lebanese people. Iraqi and Jordanian military personnel, under the direction of the United States, also went to Beirut to aid the Chamoun government. But all of this cannot intimidate the heroic Lebanese insurgents and cannot stop the vigorous development of the Lebanese people's struggle.
    From the beginning, the Lebanese people's struggle has erupted universally throughout the country. Lebanon is basically divided into five regions: Beirut, the Northern Region, the Eastern Beqaa Valley, the Central Region, and the Southern Region. Almost all major cities in these regions have seen numerous insurgents rising up to wage heroic struggles. After three weeks of sustained struggle, the insurgent people have seized control of the entire Northern Region and many areas of the Eastern, Central, and Southern Regions.
    The capital, Beirut, is the political center of Lebanon. More than 500,000 of the country's 1.5 million people live in Beirut. The fuse of this uprising, the assassination of nationalist leader Matni, occurred in Beirut on May 8th. The next day, nearly 20,000 people in Beirut attended his funeral and held demonstrations. The general strike and general market strike in Beirut began on the 12th. The Basta district, a Muslim-populated area of Beirut, has become one of the main bases for Lebanese opposition leaders leading the struggle. Opposition "National Front" leaders, former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, and others are reportedly active here. Despite the government's frenzied attacks, the insurgent people have always held this position.
    The Northern Region is one of the regions where the struggle started earliest and on the largest scale. After the people of Tripoli, the most important city here, launched a struggle on May 9th, the tide of struggle quickly spread northward. The insurgent people formed armed forces and launched offensives in various places, achieving great results.
    Tripoli is 87 kilometers from Beirut, has a population of 80,000, and is the second largest city in Lebanon and a center for trade and shipping. The Iraq Petroleum Company, mainly funded by U.S. and British capital, has a pipeline running from Iraq to the Tripoli terminal. Tripoli masses launched demonstrations and a general strike on the 9th, the masses burned down a U.S. Information Service building and launched an armed struggle with attacking military police. After several fierce battles, the insurgent people's army has been controlling the old city of Tripoli. Leading the Tripoli insurgent people's battle are the Arab Liberation Party and Popular Front leader, former Prime Minister Rashid Karami. On May 17th, Karami and others also established a "Public Committee" to manage local civil affairs.
    Another important city in the Northern Region is Halba, about 25 kilometers northeast of Tripoli. After changing hands several times, it was also controlled by the insurgent people on May 23rd, along with another stronghold, Jaba. Currently, there are reports that, with the exception of a few small areas, insurgent forces control the entire Northern Region.
    The fertile Eastern Beqaa Valley is the agricultural center of Lebanon. The main city here is Zahle. Its transportation to the Southern Region has been cut off by the insurgent people. The focus of the struggle for the insurgents in this region is Baalbek, a scenic center northeast of Zahle. This city, named after the ancient Phoenician sun god, is famous for its Greek and Roman ruins. It is 85 kilometers northeast of Beirut, located on the Beirut-Aleppo (in Syria) railway line. This time, the people's uprising in the area was led by opposition leader, former Speaker of Parliament Sabri Hamadeh. On May 13th, there were reports that the insurgent people attacked the government building and gendarmerie headquarters here. After fierce armed struggles and changing hands several times, the insurgent people occupied the entire city of Baalbek and controlled the areas east and north of it.
    In the Chouf Mountains of the Central Region is the base of the Druze tribal forces led by Socialist Progressive Party leader Jumblatt. Government forces have launched large-scale offensives against the Chouf Mountains under the cover of aircraft and artillery, but they have all been repelled by the insurgent people.
    An important city in this region is Beit ed-Dine. It is about 50 kilometers southeast of Beirut. It is the hometown of Lebanese President Chamoun, who is widely opposed by the Lebanese people. Insurgents briefly occupied Beit ed-Dine on May 13th and burned Chamoun's summer residence.
    The most important city in the Central Region is Babda. It is about ten kilometers from Beirut. On May 22nd, news of fighting also came from there.
    The Southern Region borders Syria and Israel, and its main cities are Sidon, Tyre, Marjayoun, etc. There are also strong insurgent people's forces active here.
    Sidon, anciently known as Sidon, is 45 kilometers from Beirut, has 20,000 residents, and is an important port in southern Lebanon. It and Tyre to the south are ancient cities built in the Phoenician era, and they are both strongholds of the opposition. Sidon is also the terminal of Aramco's oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia. It started strikes and disturbances very early, and since May 25th, it has turned from strikes to armed struggle.
    Further southeast, the main city of Marjayoun has a famous ancient castle and is about 100 kilometers from Beirut. It is reported that the insurgent people's forces have surrounded the garrison there.
    There are reports that another leader of the National Front, Ahmed al-Assad, leading an army active in the Southern Region, has also launched an offensive against government forces. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　黎巴嫩战局和地理形势
    黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义及其代理人夏蒙政权的起义斗争，从5月9日开始，现在已经坚持二十多天了。最初斗争采取群众大示威、总罢工和总罢市的形式；在黎巴嫩政府方面的镇压之下，斗争很快就转入了人民武装起义。美帝国主义公开干涉黎巴嫩内政，把武器源源不绝运给黎巴嫩亲西方政府，美国人担任了驾驶飞机轰炸起义者的任务，美国和英国的舰队开去恫吓黎巴嫩人民，伊拉克和约旦军事人员也在美国的指使下开往贝鲁特援助夏蒙政府。但是所有这些，都不能吓倒英勇的黎巴嫩起义人民，不能阻止黎巴嫩人民斗争的蓬勃发展。
    黎巴嫩人民的斗争，从一开始，就在全国各地普遍爆发。黎巴嫩基本分为五个地区，即贝鲁特、北部地区、东部贝卡盆地、中部地区和南部地区。这些地区的主要城市差不多都有众多的起义者起来进行英勇的斗争。经过坚持三星期的斗争，起义人民已经控制了整个北部以及东部、中部和南部的许多地区。
    首都贝鲁特是黎巴嫩的政治中心。全国一百五十多万人口中有五十多万人住在贝鲁特。这次起义斗争的导火线，民族主义领袖马特尼惨遭暗杀的事件，就是5月8日在贝鲁特发生的。第二天，贝鲁特近两万群众参加他的葬礼，举行了示威。贝鲁特的总罢工、总罢市在12日开始。贝鲁特的穆斯林聚居的巴斯塔区成为领导斗争的黎巴嫩反对党领袖们的主要根据地之一。反对党“民族阵线”领袖、前总理赛义卜、萨拉姆等人据悉就在这里活动。在政府方面疯狂进攻之下，起义人民始终坚守这个阵地。
    北部地区是斗争发动最早和规模最大的地区之一。这里最主要的城市的黎波里的人民在5月9日发起斗争以后，斗争浪潮就迅速向北蔓延。起义人民组成了武装部队，在各地发起攻势，取得巨大的战果。
    的黎波里距贝鲁特八十七公里，人口八万，为黎巴嫩第二大城市以及贸易和航运的中心。主要是美英资本的伊拉克石油公司有输油管从伊拉克通到的黎波里终点站。的黎波里群众在9日发起示威运动和总罢工，群众烧毁了美国新闻处的一所建筑物，并和进攻的军警展开武装斗争。经过几次激烈的战斗以后，起义人民军一直控制着的黎波里的旧城。领导的黎波里起义人民作战的是阿拉伯解放党和人民阵线领袖、前总理拉希德·卡拉米。5月17日，卡拉米等还建立了“公众委员会”管理当地民政。
    北部地区的另一重要城市是哈勒巴，在的黎波里东北约二十五公里。它在经过数度易手后，也在5月23日和另一据点贾巴因同被起义人民控制。目前，有消息说，除个别小地区外，起义部队控制了整个北部地区。
    土地肥沃的东部贝卡盆地是黎巴嫩的农业中心。这里的主要城市是扎赫莱。它和南部地区之间的交通已被起义人民切断。这个地区的起义者的斗争焦点是扎赫莱东北的名胜中心巴尔贝克，这座以古代腓尼基人的日光之神而命名的城市以希腊和罗马的废墟而驰名。它在贝鲁特东北八十五公里，位于贝鲁特——阿勒颇（在叙利亚）的铁路线上，这次该地区的人民起义是由反对党领袖、前议长萨布里·哈马德率领。5月13日就有消息说，起义人民袭击了这里的政府大厦和宪兵司令部，经过激烈的武装斗争和数度易手后，起义人民占领了巴尔贝克全城，并控制了它的以东和以北地区。
    在中部地区的舒弗山区是社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特所率领的德鲁斯部落人民部队的根据地。政府军队曾在飞机和大炮的掩护下向舒弗山区大举进攻，但是均被起义人民击退。
    这个地区的重要城市贝特丁在贝鲁特东南五十公里。它是受到黎巴嫩人民普遍反对的黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的故乡。起义者在5月13日曾一度占领贝特丁，焚烧了夏蒙的避暑官邸。
    中部地区最主要的城市是巴布达。它距贝鲁特约十来公里。5月22日，那里也传出了战斗的消息。
    南部地区同叙利亚和以色列接邻，主要城市有赛伊达、特尔、马贾荣等。这里也有强大的起义人民部队在活动。
    赛伊达古称西顿，距贝鲁特四十五公里，有两万居民，为黎巴嫩南部的重要港口。它与南面的特尔同是腓尼基时代兴建的古老城市，它们都是反对党的据点。赛伊达又是阿美石油公司的来自沙特阿拉伯的油管终点站。它很早就开始罢工和发生骚动，5月25日开始，又从罢工转入武装斗争。
    更往东南的主要城市马贾荣，有著名的古代城堡，距贝鲁特约一百公里。据报道，起义人民部队曾经包围了那里的驻军。
    有消息说，在南部地区活动的民族阵线另一领袖艾哈迈德·阿萨德率领的一支军队，也向政府部队发动了攻势。（新华社）
