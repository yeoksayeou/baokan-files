Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Breaking with Superstition and Inferiority Complexes: Beijing's Young Scientific Personnel Launch a New Leap Forward Tide

    Beijing's youth from various research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Association for Science Popularization, inspired by the general line of socialist construction, have launched a new wave of the Great Leap Forward. Overcoming various superstitions, they boldly proposed research plans that had not been considered in the past at the Second Congress of the Communist Youth League of the Beijing Area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held in late May, and presented many scientific and technological achievements completed ahead of schedule as a gift to the congress.
    The youth of the Polymer Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry synthesized a piece of organosilicon rubber during the congress. They aim to solve the production problem of this rubber by this year's National Day. Silicone rubber does not crack in cold regions and does not become sticky in hot regions. The most difficult part of making this silicone rubber is the filler. The youth engaged in this work had studied in Japan, and he saw that the fillers used in Japan were also imported, so in the past, he always thought that China could not solve the filler problem either. Now his thinking has leaped forward, he has broken with superstition, and finally used his own filler to make the first piece of silicone rubber in China. The youth of the affiliated factory of the Institute of Electronics, in cooperation with veteran workers, fought for five days and nights to produce a three-centimeter band standing wave measuring instrument, which is an extremely precise instrument that has not been produced in China before. Young scientific and technical personnel of the Earthquake Group of the Institute of Geophysics, disregarding the opposition of some older scientists, absorbed foreign experience recorded in literature and created through their own research, and produced the most modern electronic seismograph in the world today. The youth of the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent instruments for copying documents to the congress, which have not been produced in China before. The youth of the Institute of Psychology made an instrument for testing the distribution of attention, and some of its performances exceeded the level of the United States. The youth of the Institute of Automation and Remote Control presented more than 30 gifts to the congress, one of which was an automatic model car, which was demonstrated at the venue: through the control equipment, the car could be commanded to move forward, backward, turn, and brake at will. Among the gifts presented by the youth to the congress, there were seven items that reached the international level, and eleven new products that had not been manufactured in China before.
    Young scientific and technical personnel have put forward many research plans that they did not dare to think about in the past. The small factory of the Beijing Planetarium has only three young workers and one young designer, but they will make China's first small planetarium by the end of May this year; they will complete a medium-sized planetarium by the end of May next year; and they plan to complete a German planetarium as large as the one currently on display in the planetarium within five years. The German Zeiss factory spent more than five years on the parts design alone for this kind of planetarium. The entire young staff of the model repair group of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology is determined to transform the manual operation that has been used for twenty years into mechanization. The highest technical personnel in this group have only a junior high school education, but they have used their brains to liberate their minds and found the key to mechanization, so they dare to propose to implement full mechanization by the end of this year. Several young people with only elementary and junior high school education in the Microbiology Research Office have reached the international level in the manufacture of microbial culture media, and they will also compile a culture medium manual before this year's National Day, which was previously considered to be compiled only by senior researchers. The youth of the Beijing Botanical Garden will provide 300 kinds of rare flowers and trees before next year's National Day to green, aromatize, and beautify the capital. Not long ago, some leap forward plans were formulated by various research institutions, and now the youth will also realize them ahead of schedule. For example, the youth of the Polymer Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry proposed to deliver the photoelastic plastic, which was originally scheduled to be made by next year's "May 1st", before this year's National Day. Photoelastic plastic is a necessary material for making dam models. To build dams, especially dams as large as those in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, models must be made first to test the pressure of the water flow on the dam before they can be designed. This plastic cannot be manufactured in China, and foreign literature does not provide detailed information on its manufacturing method; import is also very difficult. The youth saw that this work was so important to national construction and were determined to complete it as soon as possible. However, several scientists in the group did not approve of their advanced indicators because the difficulties were not small. The youth also saw the difficulties, but after careful calculation, they came up with ways to overcome the difficulties, concentrating manpower; changing the one-shift work system to a three-shift system, so that the experiments that had to be interrupted every day in the past could be carried out continuously, so that the reaction that originally took two months to complete could be shortened to five days, and the trial production period could be greatly shortened, so they were confident that they could deliver the goods on schedule for this year's National Day.

### 同迷信、自卑感决裂  北京青年科学人员掀起新的跃进浪潮

　　同迷信、自卑感决裂
    北京青年科学人员掀起新的跃进浪潮
    新华社3日讯  中国科学院北京各研究机构和全国科普协会的青年，受到社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞，掀起了新的跃进浪潮。他们破除各种迷信，在5月下旬举行的中国科学院北京区共青团第二届代表大会上，大胆地提出了过去没有作过的研究计划，并且以许多提前突击完成的科学技术成果，作为向大会的献礼。
    化学研究所高分子化学组的青年在大会期间试制出了一块有机硅橡胶。今年国庆节要解决这种橡胶的生产问题。硅橡胶在寒冷的地区不会裂；在炎热的地区不会粘。做这种硅橡胶最困难的是填料问题。从事这项工作的青年过去在日本念过书，他看到日本用的填料也是进口的，所以过去他总以为中国也不可能解决填料问题。现在他思想跃进了，破除了迷信，终于用自己的填料做出了国内第一块硅橡胶。电子学研究所附属工厂的青年，在老工人的合作下奋战五昼夜，制成了三厘米波段驻波测量器，这是国内没有生产过的极精密的仪器。地球物理研究所地震组的青年科学技术人员，不顾某些老科学家的反对，吸取文献上记载的国外经验和经过自己的钻研创造，制成了目前世界上最新式的电子地震仪。中国科学院图书馆的青年给大会送来了复制文献的仪器，这些仪器是国内还没有生产过的。心理研究所的青年制成了一架测验注意力分配情况的仪器，有些性能超过了美国的水平。自动化和远距离操纵研究所的青年献给大会的礼物有三十多项，其中有一项是自动模型汽车，在会场上作了表演：通过操纵设备，可以随意指挥这辆汽车前进、后退、转弯和煞车。青年们献给大会的礼物中，达到国际水平的共有七项；过去国内没有制造过的新产品共有十一项。
    青年科学技术人员们提出了许多以往不敢想的研究计划。北京天文馆的小工厂只有三个青年工人和一个青年设计师，但是他们要在今年5月底制成我国第一架小型天象仪；明年5月底要完成中型天象仪；计划在五年内要完成像现在放在天文馆里表演的那样大的德国天象仪，德国蔡司工厂作这种天象仪仅零件设计就花了五年多。古脊椎动物研究所修模组全体青年人员决心要使沿用了二十年的手工作业变成机械化。这个组内的技术人员最高的只有初中文化程度，但是他们开动脑筋解放思想，找到了机械化的窍门，所以他们敢于提出在今年年底实行全面机械化。微生物研究室的几个只有初小、初中程度的青年，在微生物培养基的制造上已经达到了国际水平，他们还要在今年国庆前编制过去认为高级研究人员才能编的培养基手册。北京植物园的青年要在明年国庆节前提供三百种稀见的花木，用来绿化、香化、美化首都。不久以前各研究机构订出的一些跃进计划，现在青年们也要把它们提前实现。例如化学研究所高分子化学组的青年，提出要把原定明年“五一”制成的光弹性塑料，提前到今年国庆节交货。光弹性塑料是作水坝模型必需的材料。建造水坝，尤其像长江三峡中那样大的水坝，必须先作好模型来试验水流对水坝的压力，然后才能设计。这种塑料国内不能制造，外国文献也没有详细介绍它的制造方法；进口也很困难。青年们看到这件工作对国家建设如此重要，决心要尽速完成。但是组内几位科学家都不赞成他们的先进指标，因为困难不小。青年们也看到困难，然而他们经过仔细的核计，想出了克服困难的办法，把人力集中起来；把一班工作制改为三班制，使往常每日必须间断的实验连续不断地进行，这样，原来要两个月才能作完的反应可以缩短到五天，试制期限可以大大缩短，所以他们有信心在今年国庆节如期交货。
