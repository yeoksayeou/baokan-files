    Technical Talent Is Right Before Your Eyes
    Chen Zhiyan
    The great development of local industry has been underway for several months, and the achievements are so great that there's no need to elaborate. If you ask what difficulties remain, people can list several, but when it comes down to it, there are mainly two: one is machinery—technical equipment, and the other is people—technical strength.
    The machine problem will not be discussed here for the moment. Speaking of technical talent, this is indeed a headache for comrades engaged in local industry. You see, in order to obtain technical talent, comrades in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, ran countless times to the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the CPC and the Shanxi Provincial Committee, and in the end, they only managed to get one person. Is it that these higher-level Party committees are not concerned about the difficulties of their subordinates? Of course not. The problem is that more than 180 special districts, more than 2,000 counties, and more than 80,000 townships across the country are all running industries and all need people.
    What to do? Support from large cities, support from state-owned factories and existing factories, accelerated training by schools and training classes, etc., are all methods, but they still cannot meet the current needs. Well, now more than 100 counties in Sichuan Province and Pingyao County in Shanxi Province have good methods (please read today's report in this newspaper), and they have all found the technical talent they need. However, these talents were neither requested from Shanghai or Tianjin, nor were they requested from the Provincial Committee or the Prefectural Committee, but were found among the masses.
    It seems that to solve the problem of technical talent, we must start by solving ideological problems. Looking upwards and waiting for the higher authorities to send down technical talent is one kind of thinking; looking downwards and searching among the masses for the five types of soldiers (retired tank soldiers, mechanical soldiers, engineering soldiers, communications soldiers, and automotive soldiers) and the five types of craftsmen (blacksmiths, coppersmiths, silversmiths, carpenters, and stonemasons) is another kind of thinking. Believing that only those with high levels of education, extensive knowledge, and specialized school training, or those who have worked in modern factories for five or ten years are technical talent, is one kind of thinking. Believing that as long as people have rich experience in productive labor and possess general technical knowledge, they can still run factories, is another kind of thinking. Which kind of thinking best fits the current reality is obvious at a glance.
    The mass line is a panacea, and the solution to the problem of technical talent in local industry must also follow the mass line.
    Discard that kind of unrealistic thinking, and technical talent is right before your eyes!

    技术人材就在你的眼前
    陈之衍
    大办地方工业已经几个月了，成绩之大，那是不用说了，若问其中究竟还有些什么困难，人们也可以举出若干条，可是说来说去，主要的不外是两条：一个是机器——技术装备，一个是人——技术力量。
    机器问题，这里暂且不谈。说到技术人材，这确是当前办地方工业同志一件伤脑筋的事。你不见为了要技术人材，山西平遥县的同志到中共榆次地委、山西省委跑了无数趟，最后只要到一个人。难道是这些上级党委对下级的困难不关心吗？当然不是。问题在于全国一百八十多个专区、二千多个县、八万多个乡都在办工业，都在要人。
    怎么办？大城市支援、国营工厂和原有工厂支援、学校、训练班加紧培养等等都是办法，然而都还不能满足当前的需要。好了，现在四川省的一百多个县和山西省的平遥县都有了好办法（请读今天本报的报道），都找到了他们所需要的技术人材。不过这些人材既不是从上海、天津要来的，也不是从省委、地委要来的，而是从群众中找来的。
    看来，要解决技术人材问题，还是要从解决思想问题着手。眼睛向上，等待上级将技术人材派下来，这是一种思想；眼睛向下，到群众中去找五兵（退役的坦克兵、机械兵、工程兵、通讯兵、汽车兵）和五匠（铁匠、铜匠、银匠、木匠、石匠），这又是一种思想。认为只是那些文化高、知识多、受过专门学校训练的人或者是在现代工厂里干过五年十年的人才是技术人材，这是一种思想。认为只要有丰富的生产劳动的经验具有普通技术知识的人也一样能够办工厂，这又是一种思想。那一种思想最切合当前的实际，这是一看便知的。
    群众路线是百应灵丹，解决地方工业的技术人材也要走群众路线。
    丢掉那种不切实际的思想，技术人材就在你的眼前！
