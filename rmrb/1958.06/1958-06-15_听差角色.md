    The Role of a Lackey
    According to the Associated Press, Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik recently ran to Washington to meet with Dulles and gave a "first-hand report" on the Lebanese situation in Dulles' office. Then, he told reporters that he believed the United States "meant well" towards Lebanon.
    Malik, as the Foreign Minister of Lebanon, went to the U.S. State Department to deliver intelligence. All patriotic Lebanese people are opposing the aggressive policies of the United States, but Malik is covering up for the United States. What does this look like? If Malik is not the Foreign Minister of Lebanon, but Dulles' lackey, wouldn't that be more in line with the facts?

    听差角色
    据美联社报道，黎巴嫩外交部长马利克最近跑到华盛顿去见了杜勒斯，并且在杜勒斯的办公室里作了关于黎巴嫩局势的“第一手报告”。然后，他就对记者说，他相信美国对黎巴嫩是“抱有好意”的。
    马利克身为黎巴嫩的外交部长，却要向美国国务院送情报。所有的黎巴嫩爱国人民都在反对美国的侵略政策，马利克却要为美国打掩护。这像个什么样子呢？如果说马利克并不是黎巴嫩的外交部长，而是杜勒斯的听差，不是更符合事实吗？
