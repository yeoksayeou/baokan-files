Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: The thirty-four universities and colleges in the capital, which are home to a large number of senior intellectuals, have carried forward the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary and critical spirit in the "Double-Anti" movement over the past two months. A vigorous ideological transformation and conscious revolution movement has been launched among 12,000 teachers to uproot the white flag of bourgeois individualism and plant the red flag of proletarian communism. Now, the movement is advancing victoriously, criticizing bourgeois academic thought in teaching and scientific research.

The "Double-Anti" movement in the capital's universities and colleges began as a massive mass movement. More than seven million big-character posters revealed shocking facts, exposing that the biggest waste and the biggest conservatism in schools was that many of the talents cultivated were unqualified, or not both red and expert, or only expert but not red. At the same time, the limited scientific research strength could not serve the socialist cause effectively with a realistic and cooperative spirit. The big-character posters thoroughly exposed the teachers' ugly thoughts in this regard. A large number of facts pointed out that most professors not only followed the path of being expert but not red themselves, but also tried to guide young people to follow them.

After patient help from the Party and the masses, most people felt that they must change their positions. They saw that socialism was advancing rapidly, and their knowledge and skills would therefore be further improved and developed. They were full of confidence in the future. Therefore, many people called the "Double-Anti" movement a great movement to save people. So far, an average of more than 80% of the teachers in each school have expressed their determination to transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class who are both red and expert.

Once intellectuals jump out of the bourgeois cage and have a sincere desire to devote themselves to socialism, their thinking begins to be liberated. After examining their mistakes, many people have moved closer to the Party organization. They thanked the Party for loving people with virtue, requested the Party to strengthen its leadership over them, and took the initiative to talk to the Party's grassroots organizations. They also had new views on labor. On average, about half of the teachers in each school participated in various voluntary labor activities. Professor Wang Shu-xian of Beijing Medical College, who had never read newspapers much in the past, now reads newspapers for an hour every day and also cuts out editorials and articles on ideological transformation and pastes them in a notebook. Many professors have also absorbed communist ideas from pamphlets such as "Fang Zhimin's Prison Notes," "Dedicate Everything to the Party," and "The Communist Worldview." While preparing to criticize their bourgeois academic thoughts, some professors have already begun to reform their teaching work. Professor Lin Changshan of Peking University led students and young teachers to move the classroom to agricultural cooperatives, learning from farmers while carrying out research on eliminating several major pests. Teachers of the Water Conservancy Department of Tsinghua University, based on the general line of socialist construction of developing large, medium and small enterprises simultaneously, contracted several small-scale water conservancy projects, guiding students to do graduation designs so that students can adapt to the actual needs of the country after graduation.

These teachers have lived in the old society for decades. Through this ideological revolution, they have made great strides in politics and ideology. But they also believe that this is only the beginning of the revolution and that long-term and continuous efforts are needed. Teachers who have already formulated red and expert plans generally put ideological transformation as the first priority, and believe that the upcoming major rectification and major reform of teaching and scientific research is a good opportunity for them to further transform their thinking and a touchstone to test their determination to transform themselves.

    首都高等学校上万教师开始解放思想
    立志继续改造　迎接教学改革
    据新华社12日讯　集中着大批高级知识分子的首都三十四个高等学校，在过去两个多月的“双反”运动中，发扬了马克思列宁主义的革命的批判的精神，在一万二千名教师中展开了一场轰轰烈烈的思想改造、自觉革命运动，拔资产阶级个人主义的白旗，插无产阶级共产主义的红旗，现在运动正乘胜而下，在教学和科学研究方面批判资产阶级的学术思想。
    首都高等学校的双反运动，一开始就是一个声势浩大的群众运动，七百多万张大字报以触目惊心的事实，揭露了学校里的最大的浪费和最大的保守是培养出来的许多人才不合规格，或者不红不专，或者只专不红；同时，有限的科学研究力量不能实事求是地和通力合作地为社会主义事业进行有效的服务。大字报把教师们这方面的丑恶思想揭发得淋漓尽致。大量的事实指出了大多数教授不但自己走着专而不红的道路，而且力图引导青年跟着他们走。
    多数人经过党和群众耐心的帮助后，感到必须改变立场。他们看到社会主义正日跃千里，自己的知识和技能将因此得到更多的长进和发挥，对未来充满信心，因此，许多人把双反运动称作伟大的救人运动。到目前为止，各校平均80％以上的教师已表示决心要把自己改造成为又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
    知识分子一旦跳出了资产阶级的囚笼，有了投身社会主义的真诚愿望，他们的思想就开始得到解放。在检查了自己的错误以后，很多人向党组织进一步靠拢了。他们感谢党爱人以德，请求党对他们加强领导，并且主动地找党的基层组织谈心。他们对劳动也有了新的看法，各校平均半数左右的教师都参加了各种义务劳动。过去从来不大看报的北京医学院王叔咸教授，现在每天阅报一小时，还把有关思想改造的社论、文章剪下来贴在一个本子里。不少的教授还从“方志敏狱中记”“把一切献给党”“共产主义人生观”等小册子中吸取共产主义的思想武装自己。许多教授在准备批判自己的资产阶级学术思想的同时，有的已着手进行改革教学的工作。北京大学林昌善教授带领学生和青年教师把课堂搬到了农业合作社，一面向农民学习，一面开展消灭几种主要害虫的研究工作。清华大学水利系的教师根据社会主义建设总路线大、中、小企业同时并举的方针，承包了几项小型水利工程，指导学生作毕业设计，以便学生毕业后能适应国家的实际需要。
    这些教师都是在旧社会里生活了几十年的人，通过这次的思想革命，他们在政治上思想上大大跃进了一步。但他们也认为这仅仅是革命的开始，还需要长期不断努力。已经制订了红专规划的教师，一般都把思想改造列为第一项，并且认为在即将到来的教学和科学研究的大整大改，是他们进一步改造思想的好机会，也是考验自己改造决心的试金石。
