Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th – "Peace 28," China's second-largest ocean freighter designed and manufactured independently, was launched at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai on the 19th. The ship's hull is 115.5 meters long and 16 meters wide, with a deadweight of 5,000 tons and a displacement of 8,730 tons.

The construction speed of this ship is unprecedented in the history of shipbuilding in China. According to conventional shipbuilding practices, the Jiangnan Shipyard originally scheduled 18 months for the construction of this 5,000-ton ocean freighter. However, the enthusiastic workers, under the battle cry of "Everything for more, faster, better, and more economical results, everything to shorten the ship repair and construction cycle," repeatedly revised the original plan, eventually shortening it to three and a half months, aiming to launch the ship by the end of June to welcome the "July 1st" Party Day. The shipbuilding workers kept their word, and without waiting for three and a half months, they advanced the schedule by another eleven days, pushing the ship into the rising tide of the Huangpu River. The actual construction time for the entire ship, from material input to launching, was only eighty-three days, and the construction time on the slipway was only seventy days, thirty-five days shorter than the slipway construction period of the Dalian Shipyard, which builds similar ships in China.

Not only was the construction speed of this ship unprecedented, but it also saved 158 tons of steel compared to the plan, saved 96,000 man-hours, reduced the total cost by 15.5%, and the structure and welding quality of the hull were excellent.

    上海造船工人三个月完成一年半的工作
    五千吨海轮提前下水
    据新华社上海20日电　我国自行设计制造的第二艘最大的海洋货轮——“和平28号”，19日在上海江南造船厂下水。这艘货轮船身全长一百一十五点五公尺，宽十六公尺，载重量为五千吨，排水量为八千七百三十吨。
    这艘船的建设速度在我国造船史上是史无前例的。根据历年造船的常规，江南造船厂原订这艘五千吨海轮的建造时间为十八个月。但是干劲冲天的职工们在“一切为了多快好省，一切为了缩短修造船周期”的战斗口号下，再三修改原订计划，最后缩短到三个半月，要在6月底就使船下水迎接“七一”党的生日。造船工人们说到做到，没有等到三个半月，又抢先了十一天，迎着黄浦江高涨的午潮，把船推下了水。整个船从投料到下水的实际施工时间只有八十三天，在船台上的建造时间只有七十天，比国内建造同样船只的大连造船厂的船台建造期缩短了三十五天。
    这艘船不仅建造速度空前，而且使用钢材比计划节约一百五十八吨，工时节约九万六千个，总成本节约15.5％，船壳的结构和焊接质量优良。
