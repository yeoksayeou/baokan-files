　　A Single Character's Change
　　Zhong Huai
    A few months ago, our slogan was: Strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years, or in a little more time. Now, the resolution of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China reads: "Strive to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years, or in a shorter time."
    With only half a year in between, "more" has been changed to "shorter," which seems like just a difference of one character.
    However, this one-character change was not easy to achieve. It is the result of the six hundred million people fighting hard through one winter and one spring. It is the result of the heroic spirit of striving for the upper reaches greatly defeating the crawling mentality of being content with the lower reaches. It is the result of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results being grasped by more and more of the masses.
    Did the representatives of the Eighth National Congress make this change with a stroke of their pens? No, this is a modification made by thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, and other laborers with their own actions.
    The working people are the masters of history. They can write history as they wish, and they can modify it as they wish.
    Some people will say: "This is terrible! Your original formulation was already 'impatient for success and eager for quick profits.' Wouldn't this change make it even more 'impatient for success and eager for quick profits'?"
    We answer: Yes. Now that everything is ready, and the east wind is blowing. Is there anything wrong with being even more eager for the success of socialism and even closer to the interests of the six hundred million people?

　　一字之改
　　钟怀
    几个月以前，我们的口号是：争取在十五年，或者在更多一点的时间内，在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。现在，中共“八大”二次会议的决议这样写着：“争取在十五年，或者在更短的时间内，在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国”。
    时间相隔不过半年，“更多”改成了“更短”，看起来好像是一字之差而已。
    但是这一个字的改动却不是轻而易举的。这是六亿人民苦战一冬一春的结果。这是力争上游的英雄气概大破甘居下游的爬行思想的结果。这是多快好省的建设方针掌握了越来越多的群众的结果。
    是“八大”的代表们大笔一挥，作出了这样的修改吗？不，这是千千万万的工人、农民和其他劳动者以自己的行动作出的修改。
    劳动人民是历史的主人。他们要怎样写历史就怎样写，要怎样修改就怎样修改。
    有人会说：“这还了得！你们原来的提法已经‘急功近利’。这样一改，岂不更加‘急功近利’了吗？”
    我们回答：是的。现在是万事具备，又刮东风。更加急社会主义之功，更加近六亿人民之利，又有什么不好呢？
