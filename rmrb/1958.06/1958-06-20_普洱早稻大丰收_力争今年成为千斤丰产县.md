(Reported by Huang Changlu, our correspondent) Kunming, June 19th: The 100,000 mu of first-season rice in Pu'er County, Yunnan Province, inhabited by the Hani, Dai, Kucong, and Han ethnic groups, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

　　These ethnic minorities, living in the border regions of the motherland, originally had very backward production techniques, generally did not apply fertilizer, and mountainous residents even retained the primitive slash-and-burn cultivation methods. Last year, the average yield of paddy fields in the county was only 409 jin per mu. However, in just a few months this year, agriculture has undergone a major transformation. According to a pre-harvest inspection and measurement of early rice, the average yield per mu is estimated at 724 jin, 77% higher than the annual yield last year. The actual results of the recent harvest from ten agricultural cooperatives show that the estimated production was generally underestimated. One cooperative in Qian'gang Township has completed harvesting 2.7 mu of land, with a yield of 1,670 jin per mu. Most cooperatives have yields above 600 jin per mu. With the addition of the second-season rice and replanting of other crops, the county’s average yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year is a certainty.

　　The main reason why Pu'er County has been able to leap from a historically backward, low-yield county to a thousand-jin high-yield county this year is the result of striving for progress in the spirit of the General Line and constantly opposing right-leaning conservative thinking. Last year, the so-called "at the end of its resources" and "planting two seasons is not as good as one season" arguments emerged among the cadres and masses in the county. This adverse current hindered the promotion of double-cropping rice, resulting in a grain increase of only 4.6% compared to 1956. Since last winter, a large-scale debate has been continuously unfolding in the county's rural areas. The spirit of the General Line was used to criticize various right-leaning conservative ideas, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the ethnic farmers. More than 90,000 people in the county fought day and night, completing the construction of more than 90,000 mu of water conservancy projects in one winter, ensuring the timely planting of early rice. An average of 25,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu of early rice, an increase of twenty-four times compared to the fertilizer application per mu last year. The ethnic farmers also carried out a series of major reforms in farming techniques, and new technologies such as deep plowing and fine harrowing, rational close planting, fertilizer-wrapped seedlings, and triangular cluster seedlings were widely promoted in early rice fields.

　　While harvesting early rice, ethnic farmers are also rushing to plant the second-season rice. As second-season seedlings have been cultivated in advance and labor has been arranged, the Malishu Township planted the second-season rice six days after the early rice harvest. The agricultural cooperatives have decided that the second-season rice should be planted before the end of July, ensuring the realization of the target of more than 1,000 jin per mu this year.

　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Qicai photographed cadres of the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Shidong, Luxian County, checking the full grains on the rice ears in the early rice fields. The 17.8 million mu of early rice planted in Sichuan Province this year has generally headed and is growing better than any other year.

### 普洱早稻大丰收  力争今年成为千斤丰产县

    普洱早稻大丰收
    力争今年成为千斤丰产县
    本报昆明19日电　记者黄昌禄报道：云南省普洱县的哈尼、傣、苦聪、汉等民族十万亩第一季稻获得空前大丰收。
    地居祖国边疆的这些少数民族原来生产技术十分落后，普遍不施肥料，山区居民甚至还保留着刀耕火种的原始耕作方法。到去年全县平均每亩水田产量也只有四百零九斤。但在今年几个月内，就在农业上翻了一个大身。据早稻收割前的一次检查测定，平均每亩可产七百二十四斤，比去年全年产量还高77％。最近十个农业社收获的实绩说明估产还普遍偏低，谦岗乡一社已收完的二亩七分田，每亩产量达一千六百七十斤，多数社亩产在六百斤以上。加上第二季稻及复种其它作物，全县今年平均亩产千斤已成定局。
    普洱县今年能从历史上的落后低产县一跃而为千斤丰产县，主要是按照总路线精神力争上游不断反掉右倾保守思想的结果。去年，在县里的干部和群众中，曾出现所谓“山穷水尽”和“种两季不如一季”等论调，这股逆流影响双季稻推广不开，结果去年粮食只比1956年增产4.6％。去冬以来，全县农村中不断地展开了大辩论，用总路线精神批判了种种右倾保守思想，使各族农民的干劲得到空前发扬，全县九万多人民昼夜苦战，在一个冬天里修好九万多亩水利，保证早稻按时栽插。每亩早稻田平均施肥二万五千斤，比去年每亩施肥量增加了二十四倍。各族农民还在耕作技术上进行了一系列的重大改革，早稻田里普遍推广了深耕细耙、合理密植、粪包秧、三角丛秧等新技术。
    各族农民在紧张收割早稻的同时，又在抢栽第二季稻谷。由于事先已育好第二季秧和安排了劳动力，麻栗树乡早稻收割六天后，即栽下了第二季稻，各农业社已讨论决定，第二季稻要在7月底以前全部栽下，保证实现今年亩产一千斤以上的指标。（附图片）
