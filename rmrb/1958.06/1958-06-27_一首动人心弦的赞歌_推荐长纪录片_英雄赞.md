    A Soul-Stirring Anthem
    ——Recommending the Feature Documentary “Ode to Heroes”
    Ding Qiao
    I have watched "Ode to Heroes" no fewer than five or six times, from the rough cut to the finished print. Every time I watch it, even if it's just a few unrelated shots from the raw footage, I am always deeply moved, sometimes even to tears. The magnificence of life itself has an incomparably touching power. "Ode to Heroes" is so soul-stirring and deeply moving precisely because it accurately, faithfully, and unassumingly reflects life.
    "Ode to Heroes" is a soul-stirring anthem. It allows us to see again the moving scenes of the revolutionary heroism and internationalist feelings that permeate the relationship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and the heroic spirit of the Korean people under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung, who did not flinch in the face of a powerful enemy. When the dark clouds of war had already loomed over the Yalu River, and the bombs of American imperialism had already exploded on our territory, threatening our security and the peace of the Far East, 600 million people raised an angry voice: "We cannot stand idly by!" In order to resist America and aid Korea, to protect our homes and defend our country, and for the peace of the Far East, the heroic people's soldiers – the Chinese People's Volunteers – resolutely marched towards the war-torn other side of the Yalu River. The film shows the Chinese People's Volunteers marching valiantly and spiritedly across the Yalu River; scenes of them launching assaults on the enemy with storm-like fury; and also scenes of Korean people in white national costumes, disregarding life and death in the smoke of battle to rescue wounded Chinese People's Volunteers; Korean women braving the hail of bullets and shells, delivering water and food to the Chinese People's Volunteers along the trenches. How deeply moving this is!
    "Ode to Heroes" is a soul-stirring anthem. It sings the praises of the joy of victory of the heroic Chinese and Korean peoples after stubbornly defeating the frenzied aggressors; it sings the praises of the heroic character of the Korean people who are neither afraid of the hardships of war nor the burden of construction; it sings the praises of the proposal by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to realize the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea and the practical actions of our government in supporting this peaceful proposal, powerfully illustrating the profound and sincere desire for peace of the Chinese and Korean peoples. How inspiring this is!
    "Ode to Heroes" is indeed a soul-stirring anthem. It truthfully and movingly depicts the close-as-flesh-and-blood friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. On the eve of the Chinese People's Volunteers' return home, Korean families stayed up all night making souvenirs for the Volunteers, saying goodbye with great reluctance: the family of Park Jae-geun, the internationalist fighter who sacrificed himself to shield wounded Volunteers, made memorial albums for the Volunteers after their children fell asleep; Gu Fuli, a support-the-front model who lost her husband and three sons during the war, led the residents near Shangganling, holding flowers and carrying sweet rice wine on their heads, walking the small paths they had become familiar with during the war, going up the mountain to say goodbye to the Volunteers; Choi ?, at the grave of internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao; Li Chunhuan, the Korean child rescued by the "living Luo Shengjiao" – Huang Zhifu, clutching tightly to Huang Zhifu's waist belt, unwilling to let him leave; the Korean people, giving a plant of the famous Korean flower – Mugunghwa – to the returning Volunteer soldiers, repeatedly urging them to take it to Huang Jiguang's mother, asking her to plant it at the door so that it could greet the hero's mother on behalf of the Korean people every day. The Korean people bidding farewell to the returning Chinese People's Volunteers, the Chinese People's Volunteers bidding farewell to the Korean elders, grandmothers, brothers, and sisters – it was truly embrace after embrace, urging again and again, sending them off for one stretch after another, crying once and then again. The close-as-flesh-and-blood friendship forged between the Chinese and Korean peoples in the battles of sharing life and death is all the more profoundly moving!
    The heroic deeds and close-as-flesh-and-blood friendship of the Chinese and Korean peoples cannot be fully written in a thousand sheets of paper and ten thousand lines of poetry. "Ode to Heroes" concentrates and summarizes the most magnificent and moving fragments in six film reels to convey them to the audience. At the same time, the film also manages to prominently express the theme of the Chinese and Korean peoples striving for peace with political enthusiasm. After watching "Ode to Heroes," I was excited for a long time and could not calm down. In this great era illuminated by the brilliance of the General Line, let the deeds of the heroes, let the noble qualities and vast spirit of the heroes, further inspire us to move forward!

    一首动人心弦的赞歌
    ——推荐长纪录片“英雄赞”
    丁峤
    我看“英雄赞”不下五、六次，从样片到完成拷贝，每次看的时候，那怕是素材中的互不关联的几组镜头，也总是十分激动，有时甚至掉下泪来。壮丽的生活本身就具有无比感人的力量。“英雄赞”之所以动人心魄，感人肺腑，正因为它准确地、忠实地、朴素无华地反映了生活。
    “英雄赞”是一首动人心弦的赞歌。它使我们重新看到中朝两国人民浸透着革命英雄主义和国际主义感情的动人的情景，和英雄的朝鲜人民在金日成首相领导下，在强敌面前毫不退缩的英雄气魄。当战争的乌云已经压过了鸭绿江边，美帝国主义的炸弹已经在我国领土上爆炸，我国安全受到了威胁，远东的和平受到了威胁时，六亿人民发出了一个愤怒的声音：“不能置之不理！”为了抗美援朝，为了保家卫国，为了远东的和平，英雄的人民子弟兵——中国人民志愿军，毅然向战火弥漫的鸭绿江彼岸进发。影片中出现了中国人民志愿军雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江的镜头；怀着风暴般的愤怒向敌人发起冲锋的镜头；也出现了穿着白色民族服装的朝鲜人民，在硝烟中不顾生死抢救中国人民志愿军伤员的镜头；朝鲜妇女冒着枪林弹雨、沿着战壕给中国人民志愿军送水送饭的镜头。这是何等地动人心弦！
    “英雄赞”是一首动人心弦的赞歌。它歌颂了英雄的中朝人民在顽强地击败了疯狂的侵略者后的胜利的欢乐；它歌颂了朝鲜人民的既不怕战争的艰难，又不怕建设的重担的英雄性格；它歌颂了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出实现南北朝鲜和平统一的建议和我国政府支持这个和平建议的实际行动，有力地说明了中朝人民的深刻、真诚的和平意愿，这又是何等地激动人心！
    “英雄赞”确是一首动人心弦的赞歌。它真切动人地描写了中朝人民的亲骨肉般的友谊。中国人民志愿军归国前夕，朝鲜人民家家连夜为志愿军赶制纪念品，难舍难分地和志愿军话别：用身体掩护志愿军伤员而牺牲的国际主义战士朴在根的家属，等孩子熟睡以后，为志愿军做纪念册；在战争时期失去了自己丈夫和三个儿子的支前模范具富力，带领上甘岭附近的居民，手拿鲜花，头顶甜米酒，走着战时走熟了的小路，上山和志愿军话别；国际主义战士罗盛教墓前的崔?；被“活的罗盛教”——黄治富救出的朝鲜儿童李春焕，紧抓着黄治富的腰间皮带不愿让他走；朝鲜的人民，把一株朝鲜的名花——无?花交给归国的志愿军战士，再三叮嘱带给黄继光的妈妈，请他老人家把这株花栽在门口，好让它代替朝鲜人民每天向这位英雄的母亲问候。朝鲜人民送别中国人民志愿军归国，中国人民志愿军向朝鲜父老、阿妈妮、兄弟姐妹们告别，那真是拥抱再拥抱，叮嘱又叮嘱，送过一程又一程，哭了一次又一次，中朝人民在同生共死的战斗中所结成的亲骨肉般的友谊，更是何等深切动人！
    中朝两国人民的英雄事迹和骨肉般的友情，是千张纸万行诗写不完的，“英雄赞”以六本影片集中地、概括地把最壮丽最动人的片段传达给观众；同时影片也做到富有政论热情地突出地表现了中朝两国人民为了和平的主题思想。看完了“英雄赞”，我激动得久久不能平静，在这总路线光辉照耀下的伟大年代，让英雄的业迹，让英雄的高贵品质和浩荡的气魄，更鼓舞着我们前进吧！
