A New Atmosphere of Scientific Research Serving Production
    Off-Campus Collaboration Promotes On-Campus Collaboration
    Shanghai Universities and Colleges Establish Extensive Ties with Production Units

    (Our reporter Chen Xiangdong reports) Shanghai universities and colleges, while universally implementing work-study programs, have also established extensive cooperative relationships with production units in scientific research, actively serving production. The scope and number of projects in the established cooperative relationships are unprecedented. Taking Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an example, the Shanghai portion of Jiao Tong University's research plans for this year includes more than 150 topics, and cooperative relationships have been established with more than 50 off-campus units, covering areas throughout the country. For example, the cooperative relationships established in the research on substitute steel for ball bearings include Fushun Steel Plant, Luoyang Bearing Factory, Harbin Bearing Factory, Shanghai Applied Science Research Institute, and several other units.
    Due to the connection with production units, the vast majority of the selected topics, except for a few theoretical explorations in basic disciplines, are key issues that urgently need to be resolved in production development, with a large proportion of them arising from the great leap forward in production. For example, in metallurgy, there are intensified smelting and alloy steel; in machinery and electrical engineering, the expansion of the use of ductile iron; in chemical engineering, coal tar fractionation, rare element compounds, organic and inert analysis, and plastics; in textiles, chemical fiber pure spinning, blending, interweaving, dyeing, and finishing, and research on high-yield cotton combers; high-pressure equipment and processes in the chemical industry, basic problems in machine tool equipment and mechanical manufacturing processes, germanium extraction and utilization from semiconductors, high-voltage power transmission networks, and so on. These are all important topics for collaborative research between Shanghai universities and colleges, other scientific research institutions, and production departments.
    Helping production units to trial-produce new products is also an important part of cooperation. Fudan University has undertaken the task of trial-producing 150 new varieties of chemical reagents. The physics department of the university has successfully trial-produced four types of advanced research instruments, including an atomic nucleus calculator, a new type of cathode ray oscilloscope, a vacuum voltmeter, and a low-frequency oscillator, with good quality. It is now working with Shanghai Glass Factory to research and produce complete sets of advanced glass instruments. The Chemical Engineering College has successfully trial-produced four or five new products, including ion exchange resins, reactive green, and reactive blue dyes. The Chemical Engineering College is also the national research center for nylon (6-6), and the trial production of this new product is nearing success. The Physics Department of East China Normal University trial-produced a radio oscilloscope for Shanghai Communications and Electrical Company, which was completed in May. East China Textile Institute of Science and Technology has recently handed over the trial-produced new compound of o-nitroethylbenzene (4)-nitro-(2) aminoethylbenzene (dye) to printing and dyeing factories for trial use.
    These universities and colleges also directly provide design, surveying, construction, and even installation work for many production departments through cooperative relationships. Some also fully utilize their equipment capabilities, accept processing tasks, and share some urgent production tasks. Jiao Tong University designed a small tractor for Luoyang Tractor Factory and manufactured 200 eight-foot lathes for Wuxi Machine Tool Factory. Tongji University will assist 14 factories and enterprises in designing and surveying 150,000 square meters of factory buildings. Both of these schools have undertaken many production tasks from the First Ministry of Machine Building, Shanghai Communications and Electrical Company, and the Mechanical and Electrical Bureau.
    The establishment of cooperative relationships not only enables the scientific research of schools to find the correct way to closely integrate with production, but also brings many good influences to other aspects of the schools, such as enriching teaching content, strengthening the enthusiasm and drive of teachers and students, and improving internal cooperative relationships. The steam engine teaching and research group of Jiao Tong University cooperated with the locomotive section of the Shanghai Railway Bureau to study the water tank pressure problem when the train speed is increased, and brought the materials obtained in the actual investigation and research to the classroom. The teachers spoke with great interest, and the students listened with great interest. In the past, the lack of coordination and cooperation in the scientific research work of various schools was quite serious, and there were frequent disputes over the main characters, supporting roles, top hands, and subordinates, and even some teachers had disunity over the signing of papers and the distribution of royalties. Now, through the double-anti movement and the criticism of bourgeois individualism, under the influence of developing cooperation, this bad phenomenon has been basically overcome, and the spirit of collectivism has been brought into play. Whether it is between members of teaching and research groups, between teaching and research groups, or between departments, there have been great improvements in cooperative relationships. Comrades from the Scientific Research Department of Jiao Tong University compare this change in relationship to the change in rural production relations from individual farming—mutual aid teams—cooperatives.
    Due to the strengthening of internal and external cooperative relationships of schools, manpower is concentrated and research efficiency is also improved. For example, the casting teaching and research group of Jiao Tong University conducted a series of experiments on the "black spot slag problem" based on production needs in the recent study of "ductile iron", and has achieved good results.

    科学研究为生产服务的新气象
    校外协作推动校内协作
    上海高等学校同生产单位建立广泛联系
    本报讯　记者陈向东报道：上海市高等学校在普遍实行勤工俭学的同时，又在科学研究方面，同生产单位建立了广泛的协作关系，积极为生产服务。已经建立起来的协作关系，范围之广，项目之多，都为过去所未有。以交通大学为例：今年交大上海部分科研计划题目共一百五十余项，建立协作关系的校外单位在五十个以上，地区遍及全国。如在滚珠轴承代用钢的研究方面建立的协作关系就有抚顺钢厂、洛阳轴承厂、哈尔滨轴承厂、上海科学应用研究所等好几个单位。
    由于同生产单位挂上了钩，选题计划除基础学科有少数理论探讨性的课题外，绝大多数是生产发展中急需解决的关键性问题，其中由于生产大跃进所提出的问题又占很大比重。如冶金方面有强化冶炼、合金钢；机电方面关于球墨铸铁扩大使用范围；化工方面有煤焦油精馏，稀有元素化合物，有机及惰性分析，塑料；纺织方面有化纤纯纺混纺交织染整，高产量梳棉机的研究；化学工业中高压设备和工艺，机床设备和机械制造工艺中的基本问题，半导体锗的萃取和利用，高压输电网等等。这些都是上海市高等学校和其他科学研究机关同生产部门协作研究的重要课题。
    帮助生产单位试制新产品，也是协作的重要内容之一。复旦大学承接了试制一百五十种化学试剂新品种的任务，该校物理系已试制成功了原子核计算器、新式的阴极射线示波器、真空电压表、低频震荡器等四种高级研究仪器，质量良好，现正同上海玻璃厂研究生产成套的高级玻璃仪器。化工学院已试制成功的有：离子交换树脂、活性绿、活性蓝染料等四五种新产品，化工学院并且是全国对尼龙（6—6）研究的中心，对这种新产品的试制已接近成功。华东师范大学物理系为上海市交电公司试制无线电示波器，已于5月内制成。华东纺织工学院最近已将试制成功的邻硝基乙苯的新化合物（4）—硝基—（2）氨基乙苯（染料）交印染厂试用。
    这些高等学校还通过协作关系，直接为许多生产部门进行设计、测绘、建筑以至安装等工作，有的还充分利用自己的设备能力，接受加工，分担一些紧迫的生产任务。交通大学为洛阳拖拉机厂设计小型拖拉机，为无锡机床厂制造二百台八尺车床，同济大学将帮助十四个工厂企业进行十五万平方公尺的厂房设计、测绘工作，这两个学校都承接了中央第一机械工业部、上海交电公司和机电局等部门很多生产任务。
    协作关系的建立，不仅使学校的科学研究找到了密切结合生产的正确途径，也给学校其它方面带来很多好的影响，如教学内容丰富了，师生的积极性和干劲加强了，校内的协作关系也改善了。交大蒸汽机教研组同上海铁路局机务段协作研究火车提高速度时的水箱压力问题，把在实际的调查研究中所得的材料带到课堂上，教师们讲得津津有味，学生们听得也很有兴趣。过去各校科研工作中不协调和不协作的情况相当严重，经常发生主角、配角、上手、下手之争，甚至有的教师为了论文的署名和稿酬的分配而闹不团结。现在，通过双反运动，通过对资产阶级个人主义的批判，在开展协作这个风气的影响下，基本上克服了这一不良现象，发挥了集体主义精神。不论教研组成员之间、教研组之间、系与系之间，在协作关系上都有很大的改进。交通大学科学研究部的同志比喻这种关系的改变就像农村的生产关系由单干—互助组—合作社的变化一样。
    学校由于内外协作关系的加强，人力集中，研究的效率也提高了。如交通大学铸工教研组对“球墨铸铁”的研究，最近根据生产需要“黑点浮渣问题”进行了一系列的试验，已获良好效果。
