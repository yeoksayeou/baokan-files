　　Manure Doesn't Smell Anymore
　　Li Feng
    One morning, I finished plowing the barley field, sowed the seeds, and then started fertilizing.
    The movements of the people fertilizing in the neighboring field told me that the tool for applying manure was just two hands. So I put down the wooden plow and, like the other commune members, filled a basket with manure, slung it diagonally over my shoulder, with the basket containing more than twenty pounds of manure pressed tightly against my chest. I grabbed the manure with both hands and spread it evenly on the ground. A young commune member teased me, "Old Li, how does it smell?" I replied, "It's fragrant." Actually, I didn't dare look closely at how much manure I was holding in my hands, or what it looked like, especially when my hands felt something a little soft and wet instead of hard and dry chunks. The wind also came to make trouble at this time. We used our hands to throw the manure out, and it blew the manure spray back in our faces. The sensitive nose made the contradiction of being afraid of dirt and odor more acute; the nose uncontrollably ran due to the cold weather. But how to deal with it with my hands?
    In these less than a month, manure has become a valuable asset in our minds. "We have developed feelings for manure," even the female comrade who was once called "the standard young lady" said so. Indeed, when we saw rows of manure piles stacked in the fields of other communes and teams by the roadside, we were so envious and a little jealous! What a tremendous leap forward in emotion! This emotional leap was beyond our own and the villagers' expectations. Young commune members had bet with us, saying, "Spreading manure for one day, stinking for three days," they were sure that we wouldn't be able to eat after spreading manure. As a result, we ate more and more sweetly. One comrade discovered after eating that his hands were not washed clean before the meal, and there was still that thing he had feared in his fingernail crevices. The villagers who bet with us lost.
    For more than a month, the word "delicate" has also stumbled in people's feelings. In the past, some people, especially those who were called "young ladies," secretly believed that the three parts of daintiness on their bodies (maybe even a little more!) were cultivation, style, and elegance... the best flower in emotion. The more you said she was delicate, the more proud she was, and the more she tried to show herself as smaller, weaker, more wasteful, more arrogant, and useless than others. She tried to show that she spent more than others, had less practical knowledge, had a bigger temper, and had less strength... As if the more delicate she was, the more flavorful and standard she was. So peeling the skin off steamed buns became fashionable. Now, holding a large iron shovel, with the ropes of the plow and waterwheel on their shoulders and arms, and with the smell of manure and mud filling the air, surrounded by the masses, they couldn't be delicate anymore. Of course, there were also individuals who were resolutely delicate, but the result proved that this daintiness was not as good as manure in the eyes of the masses. Because farmers like manure, which can produce more grain; but they hate daintiness, which cannot satisfy hunger or thirst, and is not beautiful. Not only farmers feel this way, but people who used to be dainty now also hate that daintiness. In rural labor, you can see that the mental outlook of those with that daintiness is even older than that of the eighty-year-old men who work with us in the fields. Now, she and they (I am also one of them), compare who carries more, pulls faster, and has more strength; compare who dresses more like the masses; compare whose hands are rougher, and compare who is more tanned (some want to compete with Indians for beauty)...
    Things that were beautiful a month ago began to become ugly, and things that were ugly began to become beautiful.

### 粪不臭了

　　粪不臭了
　　李峰
    一天上午，我耕完大麦地，撒上种子，接着就施肥。
    邻地里施肥的人的动作告诉我，施大粪的工具就是两只手。于是我放下了木犁，也学着别的社员，把大粪装满筐，把筐斜挂在肩头上，装着二十多斤大粪的筐头紧靠着胸前。我两手抓起大粪，均匀地撒在地上。年轻的社员来打趣我：“老李，味道怎么样？”我回答：“很香。”其实，我不敢细看手里抓的大粪有多少，什么样。尤其在两手感到抓着的不是干硬块而是感到有点湿软的时候。风在这时也来捣蛋，我们用手把大粪撒出去，它又把粪沫迎面吹回来。嗅觉灵敏的鼻子把怕脏怕臭的矛盾闹得更尖锐；鼻子因为天冷而不能自制地向外流东西。可是，怎么用手把它处理掉呢？
    在这不到一个月的日子里，粪在我们脑子里变成了宝贵的财富。“我们同粪有了感情”，连那位曾被人称为“标准的小姐”的女同志也这样说。不错，当我们在路旁田边看到别的社和队的地里堆着一行行的粪堆时，我们是多么羡慕而又有点眼红啊！这是感情上多么巨大的跃进啊！这种感情上的跃进，出乎我们自己和老乡们的意料。年轻的社员曾和我们打赌，他们说“撒一天大粪三天臭”，他们认定我们撒完大粪一定吃不下饭。结果，我们吃得又多又香甜。有一个同志吃完饭以后，才发现他的手在饭前没有洗干净，手指甲缝里还有那过去他曾惧怕的东西。同我们打赌的老乡输了。
    一个多月来，“娇”字在人们的感情中也跌了跤。从前，有些人，特别是那些被人称为“小姐”的人，暗自认为自己身上的三分娇气（也许还多一点吧！）是教养，是风格，是优美……是感情中最好的花朵。你愈说她娇，她就愈得意，愈鼓足娇劲，努力表现自己比别人小、弱、费、傲、无用。努力表现自己比别人挥霍的多一点，实践知识少一点，脾气大一点，力气小一点……。好像愈这样娇愈够味，愈标准。所以吃馒头剥皮也就成了时髦。现在，手拿着大铁锨，肩臂套着拉犁耙和水车的绳索，粪和泥土味熏着，周围的群众看着，于是，娇不起来了。当然也有个别娇得坚决的人，结果证明，这娇气在群众中还不如粪好。因为农民喜欢粪，它能多打粮食；而厌恶娇，它不能充饥解渴，又不美。何止农民如此呢？曾经有娇气的人现在也厌恶那娇气了。在农村劳动中可以看到，有那种娇气的人的精神面貌，比和我们一起下地干活的八十多岁的老头还苍老。现在，她和他们（我也算一个吧），比谁担得多，拉得快，力气大；比谁打扮得群众化；比谁的手粗大，比谁晒得黑（有人要和印度人比美）……。
    一个月前美的东西开始变丑了，丑的东西开始变美了。
