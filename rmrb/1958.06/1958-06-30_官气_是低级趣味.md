"Official Air" is a Low-Level Interest
Wang Wendao

Chairman Mao, in his article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," praised Bethune as "a man who was of value to the people, a man who is of value to the people." To receive such an evaluation is a very high reward.

Some people view "breaking away from low-level interests" very simply. They think that so-called low-level interests seem to be nothing more than the corrupt and unbearable lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. As long as there are no habits like "eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and smoking," it seems that one is very upright and of high moral character.

In fact, the problem is not that simple. The scope encompassed by low-level interests is much broader. For example, "official air" is one such thing. The officials of the old society were slaves of the exploiting classes, nourished by the saliva of parasites who sucked the blood and sweat of the people. This was so ugly and base; yet they acted pretentiously, lording over the people, and regarded this as supreme glory, boasting about it in front of others, with talk of "returning home in silken robes, returning in glory." Isn't this the epitome of low-level interests?

Today, this set of things has been overthrown by us, and everything has become illegal. The distinction between officials and the people no longer exists. However, some cadres who should be diligent servants of the people, especially those of intellectual origin, still have official air. For example, they put on airs in front of the "common people," look down on those who "suffer," and believe that "only studying is noble." They think they are the best in the world. They put their hands in their pockets and swagger like "young masters" in front of the masses. They are unwilling to go among the masses for a stroll throughout the year, only sitting in the office issuing orders and instructions. They like to act as teachers, lecturing and directing others, always wanting to climb higher, intolerant of criticism, behaving tyrannically, favoring flattery and praise, and liking to show off themselves… In short, they everywhere demonstrate that they are some kind of cadre, different from ordinary people. They cannot appear in the guise of ordinary laborers. We also call all of these low-level interests; it is actually the remnant of the bureaucratic airs of the old society. However, it manifests itself in different forms in different eras. People's servants, this is a glorious identity and a glorious title, but in some people, it is distorted by these low-level styles so that its brilliance is not revealed. Therefore, we must also "overthrow everything" and establish a noble style of the working people.

There are two ways to overthrow it: one is for those with official air to make a thorough break with their own official air, appearing in the guise of ordinary laborers. Regardless of what kind of work they do, how high their position is, or how much power they have, they should appear as citizens in front of the people. In state organs, they should appear as ordinary staff members. If they are Party members, they should appear as ordinary Communist Party members. In this way, you will have largely broken away from that "official" low-level interest and risen to the height of a human being. The second is that we, the general public, should give a blanket rejection to those with official air, no matter who they are. Don't be superstitious about officials. If it is not the truth, then don't obey them. Whether I am a worker, a farmer, an ordinary staff member, a night-soil carrier, a street sweeper, a speaker, or a singer, as long as you use official air to oppress people, I will struggle against you. Put up big-character posters and debate with you. In this way, even if there is official air, it will not become a trend. Even if a few people cannot change for a while, it will eventually be eliminated over time.

### “官气”是低级趣味

    “官气”是低级趣味
    王文刀
    毛主席在“纪念白求恩”一文中，称赞白求恩是“一个脱离了低级趣味的人”。一个人能受到这样的评价，那是一种很高的奖赏。
    有些人把“脱离低级趣味”看得很简单。他们以为，所谓低级趣味，似乎只不过是资产阶级的腐烂不堪的生活方式。只要没有“吃、喝、嫖、赌、抽”等等嗜好，好像就算是很正派，人品高尚了。
    其实，问题并不这么简单。低级趣味所包涵的范围要广得多。比如“官气”就是一种。旧社会的官，是剥削阶级的奴仆，是由吸食人民的血汗的寄生虫的唾液来养活的，这是多么的丑陋和卑贱；但他们却装模作样，骑在人民头上作威作福，而且把这看作是无尚光荣，拿到人前夸耀，还有什么“衣锦还乡，荣归故里”之说。这岂不正是低级趣味到极点了么？
    今天这一套被我们打倒了，一概成了不合法。官和民的区别本来已不存在。但是，一些实质上应是人民勤务员的干部，特别是知识分子出身的那些人，官气还是有的，例如对“老百姓”摆架子、看不起“受苦”人，“唯有读书高”。老子天下第一。把手插在裤兜里，“相公”一样的在群众面前摇来摆去。一年四季不肯到群众中去走走，只会坐在办公室里下命令、发指示。好为人师、教训别人、指挥别人，总想向上爬，别人批评不得，态度蛮横，好人奉承、抬举、好表现自己……总之处处表现出自己是什么什么干部、和一般人不同。不能以普通劳动者的姿态出现。对于这些我们也一概叫作低级趣味，它其实是旧社会的官僚架子的余孽。不过在不同的时代表现出来的形式不同罢了。人民勤务员，这是一个光荣的身份，也是一种光荣的称号，但在一些人身上却被这些低级的风格歪扭得显不出它的光辉来。所以我们也要“一概打倒”，另去树立一种劳动人民的高尚风格。
    打倒的办法有二，一是有官气的人自己和自己的官气实行彻底的决裂。以普通劳动者的姿态出现。不管自己是作的什么工作，职位有多高，权力有多大，在人民面前要以一个公民的姿态出现。在国家机关要以一个普通工作人员的姿态出现。是党员要以一个普通的共产党员的姿态出现。这样你就大体上脱离了那种“官”的低级趣味，上升到了人的高度了。二是我们一般人，对于有官气的人不管他是谁，给他来个一概抵制。不迷信官。不是真理就不服从他，不管我是工人、农民、普通工作人员、挑大粪的、扫街道的、说的、唱的，只要你用官气压人，我就斗争你。出大字报，和你辩论。这样就是有官气，也就成不了气候，有少数人，一时改不了，久之，也终于要灭绝的。
