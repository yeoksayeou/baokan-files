　　Ideological Leap Forward: Wheat Yields Double
    Liaoyuan Cooperative Breaks with "Condition Theory" and "Habit Theory"
    (Our report) According to the Hubei Daily: Whether a low-yield area can be transformed into a high-yield area depends decisively on the subjective initiative of the people. The fact that the Liaoyuan Cooperative in Huopai Township, Xiangyang, Hubei, has repeatedly doubled its summer harvest crops powerfully proves this point.

    Consider the rate of yield increase in the Liaoyuan Cooperative: Before liberation, this area was desolate. The masses described the situation at that time as follows: "When people are unlucky, the land is burning, crops don't grow, but wormwood does. Rabbits in packs bite people, and the thorns are as tall as the wheat sprouts." The soil was also extremely poor, described as "a knife when dry, a mess when wet," and there was very little labor, with one person responsible for more than four mu of land. Consequently, wheat yields were very low. In 1956, the wheat yield was only 63 jin per mu. In 1957, the wheat yield reached 163 jin per mu, doubling the yield. This year, the average wheat yield is 400 jin per mu, and the highest yield reached 1,150 jin per mu. The total output of wheat and beans can reach more than 8 million jin, which is 1 million jin more than the total grain output of the previous two years combined.

    Deep plowing is a crucial measure for achieving a bumper wheat harvest. In the past, the masses here believed that the upland could not be deeply plowed, because deep plowing would turn up yellow soil (dead yellow soil), and crops would not grow. However, after an experiment the year before last, all the wheat that had been deeply plowed had increased yields. For example, a piece of land behind the kiln was plowed eight inches deep, turning up a layer of dead clods. But after warming the soil and applying more fertilizer, it yielded more than 300 jin per mu last year, more than doubling the yield. Last year during the summer harvest, a mass visit was organized, and a great debate was launched. Faced with the facts, many people with conservative ideas were persuaded. Even old man Li Dacheng, who still wears a queue, had his thinking changed. To ensure the quality of deep plowing, in addition to the part plowed by tractors, the party and youth league members with technical skills were designated to hold the plow for the part not plowed by machines. If they didn't have deep plowing tools, they used tandem plows and wall-less plows. As a result, more than 90% of the land increased from being plowed three inches deep to being plowed five inches deep or more.

    Another crucial measure is close planting. In the past, the masses believed that if wheat was planted too densely on the upland, it would "sit in the nest" and not grow, and even if it did, it would be like a dragonfly's head. However, after last year's experiments, visits, summaries, and debates, the old habits of the masses were also changed. The seeding rate increased from six to ten jin to more than twenty jin, and from an average of 130,000 plants per mu last year to more than 200,000 plants per mu this year. In the past, the masses planted wheat for three months and harvested for one month. Last year, due to early preparation, all preparations, including ideological, technical, and material preparations, were completed before winter sowing. All efforts were concentrated, and the wheat was sown in ten days from Cold Dew to Frost's Descent. This greatly shortened the sowing period and avoided yield reduction due to sowing too late or too early.

    In addition, this cooperative also launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign last year, increasing the base fertilizer from one and a half carts per mu last year to six carts this year, and the top dressing from three carts to fourteen carts. To solve the problem of insufficient labor, they paid attention to increasing public accumulation and adding and improving tools last year. Now, the entire cooperative has one truck, seven tractors, twelve rubber-tired carts, one hundred and fifty-nine ox carts, more than nine hundred handcarts, as well as water pumps, flour mills, and cotton gins. Plows, harrows, and hoes have also been repaired, and some have been replaced with new and improved agricultural tools. This has increased labor productivity four to five times.

    This cooperative is preparing to create even greater miracles, taking various specific measures to strive for a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu next year, doubling it again. They are now actively preparing for winter sowing.

    The Hubei Daily published an editorial for this. The editorial believes that some outdated concepts and habitual forces still bind people's minds, hindering the leap forward in low-yield areas. The main ones are "condition theory" and "habit theory." "Condition theory" one-sidedly emphasizes the poor natural conditions of low-yield areas, using this to comfort oneself and be satisfied with the status quo. "Habit theory" one-sidedly emphasizes the inherent farming habits of the masses, and does not dare to boldly implement technical reforms. The editorial uses the facts of the Liaoyuan Cooperative to prove that: there are only low-yield ideas, not low-yield areas; there are only poor farming systems, not poor land. As long as people's subjective initiative is fully utilized, natural conditions and farming habits can be changed. "Condition theory" and "habit theory" must be broken.

    The editorial believes that liberating thought and changing work style are the keys to transforming low-yield areas into high-yield areas. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the favorable opportunity of the summer harvest, deeply discover high-yield models in low-yield areas, carry out mass visits, evaluations, acceptances, and summaries, use facts to educate people, liberate thought from top to bottom, change work style, summarize experience, find out the key measures for each area to change from low-yield to high-yield, and vigorously promote them.

### 思想大跃进　小麦加一翻  燎原社打破了“条件论”和“习惯论”

　　思想大跃进　小麦加一翻
    燎原社打破了“条件论”和“习惯论”
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：低产区能不能变成高产区，人的主观能动性是一个决定的因素。湖北襄阳伙牌乡燎原合作社连年使夏收作物翻上加翻的事实，有力地证明了这一点。
    请看燎原社的增产速度：解放前，这里一片荒凉，群众形容那时的情况说：“人背时，地发烧，不长庄稼长燎蒿，兔子成群都咬人，刺葛芽和麦子比低高。”土质也是顶坏的，“天干一把刀，下雨一团糟”，劳力也很少，一个人合四亩多地。因而那时小麦产量很低。1956年小麦单产还只六十三斤，1957年小麦单产达到一百六十三斤，翻了一翻，今年小麦平均单产四百斤，最高亩产达到一千一百五十斤，麦、豆总产可达八百多万斤，一季比去年和前年两年的粮食产量总和还多一百万斤。
    深耕是争取小麦丰收的关键性的措施。过去，这里的群众认为岗地不能深耕，深耕了翻黄（把死黄土翻起来），不长庄稼。经过前年试验，凡是深耕的小麦都增了产。如窑后的一块地犁了八寸深，掀起一层死垡子，可是经过炕地，又多施了肥料，去年一亩地就收了三百多斤，增产一倍多。去年夏收时，组织了群众性的参观，开展了大辩论。在事实面前，许多有保守思想的人都被说服了。连至今头上还留有个小辫子的李大成老汉的思想也通了。为了保证深耕的质量，除了拖拉机深耕的部分外，对没用机器耕种部分，都指定有技术的党、团员掌犁。没有深耕工具，他们就用套犁、无壁犁。结果，90％以上的地都由耕三寸深增加到耕五寸深以上。
    另一个关键性的措施就是密植。过去群众认为岗地小麦种密了“坐蔸”长不起来，就是长起来也是蜻蜓脑壳。可是经过去年的试验、参观、总结、辩论，也改变了群众的老习惯，下种量由六至十斤增加到二十多斤，由去年的平均每亩十三万株增加到今年的二十万株以上。过去群众种小麦是三个月种一个月收。去年由于准备早，在冬播前就做好了思想、技术、物资等一切准备，集中全力从寒露到霜降十天时间就把小麦全部播种下地了，这样就大大缩短了播种期，避免了因播种太迟或太早而减产。
    此外，这个社在去年还开展了大规模的积肥运动，使每亩底肥由去年的一车半增加到今年的六车，追肥由三车增加到十四车。为了解决劳力不足的困难，去年他们就注意了增加公共积累，添置和改进工具。现在全社已有汽车一部、拖拉机七台、胶轮马车十二辆、牛车一百五十九辆、人推车九百多部，还有抽水机、磨面机、轧花机等，犁耙锄头也进行了修整，部分换上了新式和改良农具。这样就提高劳动生产率四到五倍。
    这个社准备创造更大奇迹，采取各项具体措施，争取明年小麦亩产一千斤，再来个翻一翻。现在，他们已经在积极准备冬播。
    湖北日报为此发表了社论。社论认为：至今还有些陈旧观念和习惯势力束缚着人们的思想，障碍着低产地区的跃进，主要的就是“条件论”和“习惯论”。“条件论”片面强调低产地区的自然条件不好，以此来安慰自己，满足现状。“习惯论”片面强调群众的固有耕作习惯，不敢大胆地实行技术改革。社论用燎原社的事实证明：只有低产思想，没有低产地区；只有不良的耕作制度，没有不良的土地。只要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，自然条件和耕作习惯都是可以改变的。“条件论”和“习惯论”必须予以打破。
    社论认为，解放思想，转变作风，是变低产地区为高产地区的关键。因此，应当抓住夏季丰收这个有利时机，深入发现低产地区的高产典型，开展群众性的参观、评比、验收、总结，用事实教育人们，从上到下地解放思想，转变作风，总结经验，找出每一个地区低产变高产的关键性措施，而加以大力推广。
