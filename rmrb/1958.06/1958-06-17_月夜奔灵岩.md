　　Moonlit Run to Lingyan
　　Ge Bizhou

　　April 3rd was my first day as the Deputy Party Branch Secretary of the New City Township.

　　The Party Committee Secretary assigned to the branch was a female comrade. She came back very late last night, and I hadn't met her yet. Just as dawn broke, I ran into her at the gate. She was about to go out with a straw hat in her hand, and she asked me to go with her to weed the corn.

　　After dinner, the Lingyan First Cooperative sent good news: they had overfulfilled the task, accumulating 210,000 jin of fertilizer per household! The Party Committee Secretary was very excited. Her short stature was as solid as a small cannon; her words were like whistling bullets. She shouted: "Tomorrow, organize all the township's cooperative leaders to go to the Lingyan First Cooperative to visit and learn!" Someone suggested: "It's best to check it out first, then organize the visit." She thought it made sense and wanted to go immediately. It was getting dark, and it was a twenty li round trip, and it was also in the mountains, so everyone advised her to go tomorrow. She shouted: "What are you afraid of! We'll be back before dawn!" I was infected by her fighting spirit and went to Lingyan with her.

　　Leaving the city through the north gate, the sun set, and Mount Lingyan put on a deep blue cloak, rushing towards us! On the Chengdu-Aba highway, cars were still dragging yellow dust, speeding towards the ten thousand snow-capped mountains. The black, dense forests on both sides of the high mountains were like two huge arms, embracing us warmly. In this vast twilight mountain road, it was filled with the sound of wind, the roar of trees, and the chirping of birds.

　　The Party Committee Secretary's hurried footsteps were so powerful and so firm. She was not walking on the road, she was walking ahead of tens of thousands of peasants, she had walked from the dark road: fighting landlords, she was in the front; opposing bandits and local bullies, she was in the front; the great march of peasants, she was in the front; now heading straight to socialism, she is still in the front. Her short body looked tall in the twilight!

　　At the foot of the mountain at the bend of the road, there was a stone archway with the four characters "Lingyan Scenic Spot" on it. I then remembered that this was one of Guanxian's famous scenic spots - "Lingyan Victory Lights". Because on clear dark nights, from this hilltop, you can see the flying phosphorescent sparks.

　　We climbed the stone steps and entered the dim forest. The fifteenth moon, understandingly shone through the dense branches, illuminating the moss-covered stone steps. In a mountain depression, we heard the sound of rocks exploding on the opposite mountain, and the sound of trees falling down in front of us. Not far away, we saw three or five farmers felling trees. A tall, thin man with a white turban welcomed the Party Committee Secretary. He was Chang Shibing, the accountant of the Lingyan First Cooperative. He and the cooperative members were very happy and competed to lead us to visit.

　　The Party Committee Secretary stretched her voice and shouted to the opposite mountain:

　　"Sister-in-law Xie! Sister-in-law Xie!..."

　　"Party Committee Secretary! Come over here!" a woman shouted back: "Have dinner here! Rest here!" The Party Committee Secretary said there were too many people. But the other party replied:

　　"Invite everyone together!" This forced the Party Committee Secretary to agree to go after work was done. Several shouts, like several birds suddenly taking flight. The Party Committee Secretary asked:

　　"What are you doing?"

　　"We are making soil blocks!" a woman replied.

　　"Can you see?"

　　"We can see, the moon is lighting our way!"

　　"How many of you are there?"

　　"There are more than ten of us!"

　　"How many women are there?"

　　"There are five women!"

　　"What about the children?"

　　"The older ones are left at home, the younger ones are carried on our backs."

　　"Are you tired?"

　　"We're building socialism, we're not afraid of being tired!" This last sentence sounded particularly loud. It made Accountant Chang, who was leading the way, laugh excitedly.

　　We walked on the dark, shady mountain road, and as we walked, more people led the way. Three production team leaders came. Under the moonlight, we were no longer walking on the road: we were walking in the woods, and there were piles of fertilizer everywhere in the woods; we were walking on the barren slopes, and there were piles of fertilizer everywhere on the barren slopes; we were walking on every field edge, and every field edge was also filled with fertilizer. In the moonlight, we climbed the cliffs. On the edge of a field, a black shadow was wriggling and making a clattering sound. The Party Committee Secretary asked what it was? I shined the flashlight on it, and it was a bright red figure, a young man wearing a red velvet jacket, making soil blocks. Accountant Chang said it was the Zhao's son, studying in the city, coming back to work at night. In the moonlight, we climbed the cliffs. Walking on the loose soil of the steep slope, the sod was removed from every field; the cliffs were scraped clean. The moon shone on them, like bluish-white scalps. They affectionately called this giving the field scalps a shave and giving the cliff walls a facial. In the moonlight, we climbed the cliffs. One by one, the fertilizer piles were like small mountains. The Party Committee Secretary walked along the edge of the fertilizer piles, like a deer, running so fast that I couldn't keep up even with the flashlight. Fortunately, it was dark, and we couldn't see the deep valleys below the cliffs, nor could we see the mountain peaks above the cliffs; if it were daytime, we would definitely be dizzy and weak. Accountant Chang said that two big characters were scraped out on this steep cliff, hung up with ropes. I shined the flashlight on them, and they were the stone-carved characters "Lingyan." As we walked, we saw the pagoda tips and temples revealed in the dark, dense forest. The Party Committee Secretary said:

　　"We have reached the Lingyan Temple on the top of the mountain!"

　　We went in from behind the temple, the door of the main hall was closed, the tree shadows swayed on the "Reception Hall" plaque, and the moonlight was like a sea of ​​water. We held a temporary small meeting in front of the hall of the bright moon ancient temple. The Party Committee Secretary sat on a stone bench recording, and I held the flashlight.

　　The sixth team, led by Zhou Taihua, had accumulated the most fertilizer. In the past, he did not believe that sod could be used as fertilizer; after visiting the Qingcheng First Cooperative, he thought that people used sod as fertilizer and grew good crops, so why couldn't we? He immediately launched a four-day and four-night blitz of fertilizer accumulation, like the accumulated water in a deep pool, opening a gap and pouring out thousands of miles. The Party Committee Secretary whispered to me:

　　"It proves once again: even if you wear your lips out a thousand times, it is better to show a practical example once!"

　　The night was deep, and the stone bench was cold. We carried the enthusiasm of victory, bathed in moonlight, stepped on the stone steps, and walked down the mountain lightly. In the open space on the mountaintop, the Party Committee Secretary pointed to the four big rivers below the mountain, winding and rushing, shimmering and flying in the moonlight, like silver giant pythons. She said excitedly:

　　"Lao Ge, look! That is the Puyang River, the upper reaches of the Puyang River are all ours; Lao Ge, look! That is the Baitiao River, the upper reaches of the Baitiao River are all ours; Lao Ge, look! That is the Zouma River, the upper reaches of the Zouma River are all ours; Lao Ge, look! That is the Jiang'an River, the upper reaches of the Jiang'an River are all ours." She loves to say "ours!" The new world, in her eyes, is all ours.

　　As we were about to go down the mountain, dark clouds covered the moon, and the wind and rain shook the trees. The Party Committee Secretary shouted like a little girl:

　　"Let it rain harder, so that after we finish making soil blocks on the mountain tomorrow, we can plant the early corn!" She likes to say "Give me..." how, such as "Give me to do the work well!" "Give me plant the seedlings densely!" Whatever she asks people to do that is beneficial to the people, in her mouth, she says "Give me" how.

　　Returning to the township government in the rain, it was already past two o'clock in the morning.

　　Plant seedlings at Qingming,
　　Good news comes from the high mountains!
　　New City's female Party Secretary,
　　Moonlit run to Lingyan.

戈壁舟

    月夜奔灵岩
    戈壁舟
    4月3日，我第一天担任新城乡副总支书。
    党委包支书是个女同志。昨夜她回来得很晚，还未见面。天刚亮在大门口碰上了她，正拿着草帽要出去，她就叫我跟她去薅玉米。
    晚饭后灵岩一社送来捷报：超额完成任务，每户积肥二十一万斤！包支书很兴奋。她矮小的身材，结实得像小钢炮；说话像呼啸着的炮弹。她喊道：“明天组织全乡社长，到灵岩一社去参观学习！”有人提出：“最好先去检查一下，再组织参观。”她觉得很有道理，马上就要去。天快黑了，来回有二十里路，又在大山里，都劝她明天再去。她喊道：“怕啥子！要不到天亮就回来了！”我被她的战斗精神感染，同她一起去灵岩。
    穿城出北门，太阳落山了，灵岩山披上深蓝色的大氅，迎面扑来！成阿公路上，还有汽车拖着黄尘，向那万重雪山飞驰。两面高山黑??的森林，像两只巨大的手臂，亲切地向我们拥抱。在这苍茫暮色的山中公路上，充满着风声、树啸和鸟鸣。
    包支书急促的脚步，那样有力，那样坚定。她不是走在公路上，她走在几万农民的前头，她从黑暗的道路上走了过来：斗争地主，她走在前头；反匪反霸，她走在前头；农民大进军，她走在前头；现在直奔社会主义，她仍然走在前头。她矮小的身躯，在暮色中显得高大！
    在公路弯处的山脚下，有一座石牌坊，上有“灵岩胜地”四个大字。我才想起这是灌县名胜之一——“灵岩胜灯”。因为在天晴的黑夜里，从这座山头上，可以看见飘飞着的万星磷火。
    我们爬着石梯，进入昏暗的森林。十五的月光，知趣地透过茂密的树枝，照亮着长满苍苔的石梯。在一个山洼里，听见对山有崩石头的爆炸声，听见前面有树木倒下的喘息声，走不多远，见三五农民正在伐树。一个包白布帕的瘦高个子，欢迎着包支书，他是灵岩一社的会计常师炳。他和社员都很高兴，争着引我们前去参观。
    包支书拉长嗓子向对山喊着：
    “谢大嫂！谢大嫂！……”
    “包支书！快过来！”一个女人回喊着：“就在这里吃晚饭！就在这里歇！”包支书推说人多。人家却回答道：
    “人多就一齐请！”弄得包支书只得答应工作完毕就去。几处喊声，像几只鸟儿突然飞起。包支书问道：
    “你们在做啥子？”
    “我们在培地（打土块）！”是一个女人在回答。
    “你们看得见不？”
    “看得见，有月亮给我们点灯！”
    “你们有几个人？”
    “我们有十多个人！”
    “有几个女的？”
    “有五个女的！”
    “娃娃怎样办？”
    “大娃放在家里，小的背在背上。”
    “你们累不累？”
    “搞社会主义嘛，还怕累！”这最后的一句话，听来特别响亮。引得带路的常会计，也兴奋地笑了。
    我们在黑暗的山阴道上走着，走着走着，带路的人多了。有三个生产队长来了。我们在月光下，走的已经不是道路：我们走在树林里，树林里到处都是肥料堆；我们走在荒坡上，荒坡上到处都是肥料堆；我们走在每个地边，每个地边也堆满着肥料。我们在月光下，攀登着悬岩。在一个地脑壳边，一团黑影在蠕动，并且发出咄咄的响声。包支书问那是啥？我用电棒一照，鲜红的一团，是一个青年穿着红绒衣在培地，常会计说是赵家的娃儿，在城里上学，晚上回来劳动。我们在月光下，攀登着悬岩。走在陡坡的松土上，每个地脑壳，都铲掉了草皮；悬岩陡壁上，都刮光了。月亮照着，像青白色的头皮。他们亲切地把这叫做给地脑壳剃头，给岩壁修面。我们在月光下，攀登着悬岩。一个个肥料堆，像一座一座的小山。包支书走在肥料堆的岩边，像小鹿一样，跑得风快，我打着电棒也赶不上。幸好是在黑夜里，看不清岩下的深谷，也看不清岩顶上的山头；要是在白天的话，一定会眼花腿软。常会计说这个陡岩上刮出两个大字来，是吊着绳子上去的。我用电棒一照，是石刻的“灵岩”两字。走着走着，望见了在黑森森的丛林中，露出了塔尖和庙宇了。包支书说：
    “我们已经到了山顶的灵岩寺了！”
    我们从庙后进去，大殿的门已经关了，“接引殿”大匾上摇曳着树影，月光像水波万里。我们就在明月古刹的殿前，开了一个临时的小会。包支书坐在石凳上记录着，我打着电棒。
    积肥最多的是六队，队长周泰华。从前他不相信草皮能够作肥料；去青城一社参观后，想到人家用草皮作肥料，种好了庄稼，我们为啥子不能作呢？马上展开了四昼夜的突击积肥运动，像那深潭的积水，打开了缺口，就一泄千里。包支书悄悄地向我说道：
    “又一次证明：哪怕你一千次把嘴皮说烂，还不如拿一次实际出来看！”
    夜深了，石凳清冷。我们带着胜利的热情，披着月光，踏着石梯，轻快地走下山去。在山头上的开朗处，包支书遥指着山下的四条大河，蜿蜒奔腾，在月光下闪耀飞舞，像银色的巨蟒。她兴奋地说道：
      “老戈，你看！那是蒲阳河，蒲阳河的上流头，都是我们的；老戈，你看！那是柏条河，柏条河的上流头，都是我们的；老戈，你看！那是走马河，走马河的上流头，都是我们的；老戈，你看！那是江安河，江安河的上流头，都是我们的。”她爱说“我们的！”新世界在她的眼中，都是我们的。
    快下山时，乌云遮着月亮，风雨摇着树林。包支书像一个小姑娘似的喊叫着：
    “给我下大些，明天山上培完地，就好点早玉米了！”她爱说“给我……”怎样，如“给我把工作作好！”“给我把秧子栽得密密的！”凡是叫人作对人民有利的事情，在她的口中，都说成“给我”怎样了。
    冒雨回到乡政府，已经半夜过两点钟了。
    清明把秧栽，
    高山捷报来！
    新城女支书，
    月夜奔灵岩。
