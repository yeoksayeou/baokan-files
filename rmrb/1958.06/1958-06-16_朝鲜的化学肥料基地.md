Brotherly Nation Construction

    North Korea's nitrogen fertilizer plant, built in the industrial city of Hungnam, has recently been put into production.
    This factory will supply 136,000 tons of high-quality nitrogen fertilizer to the vast rural areas every year. It undertakes an important task for the development of North Korea's agricultural economy.
    Just two years ago, this place was full of broken walls, rubble, and weeds. Today, the sweat and creativity of the North Korean working class, coupled with the selfless assistance of the Soviet people, have borne fruit on this ruin—the fertilizer plant has been built.
    Various equipment in this factory is automated, and automatic signal lights indicating the operation of important equipment are installed in each workshop. The operators of each machine can understand the operating status of the entire machine through automatic instruments. Communication between the workshops is also done by automatic signal devices. In this way, only thirty or so machine operators are needed for production in a shift. If machine repair workers are included, only sixty-five people in total are enough to participate in the operation.
    After the factory started operation, it overproduced more than 50 tons of fertilizer than planned in the first five days alone. Now, workers and technicians are launching a selfless labor competition to achieve the task of producing 630,000 tons of chemical fertilizer in the final year of the first five-year plan proposed by the first congress of the Korean Workers' Party.

    朝鲜的化学肥料基地
    在民主朝鲜工业城市兴南建设起来的氮肥工厂，已在不久前投入生产了。
    这个工厂每年将向广大农村供应十三万六千吨优质氮肥。它为发展朝鲜的农业经济，担负着重要的任务。
    仅在两年以前，这里满地都是断垣残瓦和杂草。今天，朝鲜工人阶级的汗珠和创造，加上苏联人民的无私援助，在这个废墟上结了果实——肥料厂建成了。
    这个工厂的各种设备都是自动化的，各个车间里安装着标志重要设备操作的自动信号灯。各个机台的操纵工，通过自动仪表就能够了解整个机器的运转状态。各个车间之间的联络也是靠自动信号装置。这样，一班只用三十多名机器操纵工人就能进行生产，如果把机器修配工人也包括在内，一共只有六十五人参加作业就够了。
    工厂开工以后，仅头五天就超计划多生产了五十多吨肥料。现在工人和技术人员，正为实现朝鲜劳动党第一次代表大会提出的在第一个五年计划的最后一年生产六十三万吨化学肥料的任务，展开忘我的劳动竞赛。
