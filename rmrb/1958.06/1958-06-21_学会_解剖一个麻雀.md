    Learn to "Dissect a Sparrow"
    Li Fanfu

    Our leading cadres at all levels must learn to "dissect one or several sparrows." This doesn't mean that we want all these comrades to become biologists, but that we should value and be good at conducting investigations and research. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to respect materialism and dialectics. How do we respect them? Not by making them sound very profound and mysterious, making people feel they are out of reach, but by using this theory to solve practical problems and by using popular language to publicize it, so that people understand it as soon as they hear it. To apply materialist dialectics in practical work, we must proceed from reality, conduct investigations and research, and have analytical work. How do we start investigations and research? To investigate, we must conduct typical investigations. To understand the sparrows of the world, we don't have to dissect all the sparrows, dissecting one or several is enough. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

    "For those who are responsible for guiding work, it is the most basic method of understanding the situation to grasp a few cities, a few villages in a planned way, and use the basic viewpoints of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis, to conduct several thorough investigations. Only in this way can we have the most basic knowledge of Chinese social problems.
    To do this, first, look downward, don't just look up to the sky. Without the interest and determination to look downward, one will never truly understand China's affairs.
    Second, hold investigation meetings. Wandering around, listening to rumors, will definitely not yield complete knowledge." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" - 1953 first edition, Volume III, pages 809-810)

    These instructions made by Comrade Mao Zedong seventeen years ago still have practical significance today and in the future. Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached importance to investigation and research, and used this to guide the Chinese revolution and educate cadres.

    Comrade Mao Zedong saw the development direction of 500 million farmers from the cooperative of three "poor sticks" precisely because he did the "dissection" work on this cooperative, had a deep understanding of the cooperative and the emotions of the farmers, knew that the cooperative would definitely increase production, and knew that most farmers agreed to set up cooperatives. Therefore, when the wind of anti-"rash advance" blew up, Comrade Mao Zedong was good at discerning the wind direction and was able to point out the correct direction for the people of the whole country. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong can achieve such correct leadership, I think, is primarily because he is good at conducting systematic and thorough investigations and research, good at using Marxism-Leninism to analyze problems, and good at dissecting one or several sparrows. Investigating one or several units is to solve general and specific problems. From the perspective of the cognitive process, it "always expands from recognizing individual and special things to recognizing general things. People always first recognize the special essence of many different things, and then it is possible to further carry out generalization work to recognize the common essence of various things." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" - 1953 first edition, Volume II, page 776) After we recognize the common essence of things, we use this understanding as a guide to further study the various special things that have not yet been recognized. Comrade Mao Zedong made an extremely comprehensive and profound analysis of the dialectical relationship between the general and the special, the commonality and the individuality in "On Contradiction," and believes that this is "the essence of the question of the contradiction of things, and not understanding it is tantamount to abandoning dialectics." Our emphasis on dissecting typical things is guided by this principle of dialectics.

    I myself have been doing theoretical education work for a not short time, but my achievements are few, and my work of integrating theory with practice is very poor, precisely because of the lack of frequent investigation and research work, especially the lack of typical investigation and research, and I have not learned to dissect one or several sparrows.

    I recently went to the countryside for more than a month and received a great education. I preliminarily investigated the leadership methods and leadership style of some county party committees, and in particular, investigated the experimental fields planted by cadres in Hong'an, Macheng, Sui County, and Zaoyang, which gave me great inspiration. My experience from going to the countryside for investigation and visits is as follows:

    First, we must combine cursory observation with in-depth investigation, but we should focus on in-depth investigation. Because to conduct systematic investigation and research, cursory observation is not enough. For in-depth investigation, we must stay in one place, look downward, and learn from the masses with extremely high enthusiasm. Without this step, the investigation will not be done well. Only by mastering typical key materials and then comparing and combining them with the general materials obtained from cursory observation, can we have a comprehensive and profound understanding of the problem. In-depth investigation and cursory observation are a unity of opposites. Under certain conditions, the results obtained from these two transform into each other, and the experience of points and areas are combined with each other. This is dialectics.

    Second, we must combine listening with seeing. The main method of investigation and research is to hold investigation meetings. When I investigated experimental fields, I mainly conducted investigations with three groups of comrades: first, leading cadres; second, the masses; and third, technical cadres. The experimental field is a combination of the three, and the investigation should also be a combination of the three. Before or after the investigation meeting, go to the fields to see the experimental fields. Listening and seeing are often contradictory. We cannot be careless. There are often differences between what we hear and what we see. The difference is the contradiction. We must clarify them, resolve the contradiction, unify what we hear and what we see, and draw correct conclusions.

    Third, we must unify the layman and the expert. I am a layman in rural work. Therefore, this time when I went to the countryside, I went to investigate with local experienced comrades. When I inspected work in Xiangyang, I went with the secretary of the prefectural party committee. They have rich practical knowledge and helped me a lot. And the experts, because they are used to seeing many things in the countryside, sometimes do not feel that things that we think are very fresh are fresh. We laymen highlight the problems, which is helpful to them. The expert and the layman are also a unity of opposites. This is also dialectics.

    Fourth, we must unify analysis and synthesis. When we study problems, we must grasp as much material as possible. But faced with a pile of materials, a pile of phenomena of things, how to recognize its essence requires analytical work. The analysis must be systematic and thorough. We must have a clear understanding of all parts of things. From the analysis, we must expose the internal connections of things, and then synthesize them to point out the nature and development direction of the problem. In this way, we will have an essential understanding of this thing.

    To respect materialism and respect dialectics, we must conduct investigation and research, we must use materialist dialectics to observe problems, analyze problems, and learn to "dissect one or several sparrows." The "sparrow" is an objective existence, and it is also a unity of opposites with our subjective understanding. If we do not dissect it, it cannot be unified with our subjective understanding. "Dissecting the sparrow" is to make the subjective correctly reflect the objective, that is, to make the subjective consistent with the objective. When the subjective is consistent with the objective, we can correctly guide the work, otherwise we will commit subjectivism. Therefore, when we implement the general line of building socialism stipulated by the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party, we must not underestimate the work of "dissecting one or several sparrows."

### 学会“解剖一个麻雀”

    学会“解剖一个麻雀”
    李凡夫
    我们各级领导干部都要学会“解剖一个或几个麻雀”，这并不是要我们所有这些同志都当生物学家，而是要我们重视和善于作调查研究。毛泽东同志教导我们要尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法。如何尊重呢？不是要把它说得非常深奥神秘，使人觉得高不可攀，而是要运用这个理论来解决实际问题，并且要用通俗的语言进行宣传，使人一听就懂。要在实际工作中运用唯物辩证法，就得从实际出发，就得作调查研究，就得有分析工作。调查研究又从何着手呢？要调查，必须作典型的调查。要了解天下的麻雀，不是要解剖所有的麻雀，只解剖一个或几个就够了。毛泽东同志说：
    “对于担负指导工作的人来说，有计划地抓住几个城市、几个乡村，用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，作几次周密的调查，乃是了解情况的最基本的方法。只有这样，才能使我们具有对中国社会问题的最基础的知识。
    要做这件事，第一是眼睛向下，不要只是昂首望天。没有眼睛向下的兴趣和决心是一辈子也不会真正懂得中国的事情的。
    第二是开调查会。东张西望，道听途说，决然得不到什么完全的知识。”（“毛泽东选集”——1953年第一版，第三卷，八○九—八一○页）
    毛泽东同志在十七年前所作的这些指示，现在和今后都有现实意义。毛泽东同志历来都重视调查研究，并依此来指导中国革命和教育干部。
    毛泽东同志从三个“穷棒子”的合作社看到了五亿农民的发展方向，就因为他对这个合作社做了“解剖”工作，对合作社和农民情绪有了深刻的了解，知道合作社一定能够增产，知道大多数农民赞成办合作社。因此，当反“冒进”的风吹起来以后，毛泽东同志善于辨别风向，能够给全国人民指出正确的方向。毛泽东同志能作到这样的正确的领导，我觉得首先就是由于他善于作系统周密的调查研究，善于用马克思列宁主义分析问题，善于解剖一个或几个麻雀。调查一个或几个单位，这是为了解决一般和特殊的问题。从认识过程来说，“总是由认识个别的和特殊的事物，逐步地扩大到认识一般的事物。人们总是首先认识了许多不同事物的特殊的本质，然后才有可能更进一步地进行概括工作，认识诸种事物的共同的本质。”（“毛泽东选集”——1953年第一版，第二卷，七七六页）当我们认识了事物的共同本质之后，就以这种认识为指导，进一步去研究尚未认识的各种特殊事物。毛泽东同志关于一般与特殊、共性与个性的辩证关系，在“矛盾论”中作了极为全面和深刻的分析，并认为这是“关于事物矛盾的问题的精髓，不懂得它，就等于抛弃了辩证法”。我们重视对典型事物加以解剖，就是根据这一辩证法的原理为指导的。
    我自己做理论教育工作时间不算短，但成就很少，理论联系实际的工作做得很差，就是由于缺乏经常的调查研究工作，特别是缺乏典型的调查研究，没有学会解剖一个麻雀或几个麻雀。
    我最近下乡一个多月，受到的教育很大。我初步地调查了一些县委的领导方法和领导作风，特别调查了红安、麻城、随县和枣阳等地干部种的试验田，这给我很大的启发。下乡调查访问，我的体会是这样的：
    第一、要做到走马看花与下马看花相结合，但应当以下马看花为主。因为要作系统的调查研究，光走马看花是不行的。下马看花，就得在一个地方住下来，眼睛向下，以极高的热情向群众学习。没有这步工夫，调查是搞不好的。只有掌握了典型的重点的材料，再与走马看花所得的面的材料相比较相结合，对问题才会有全面而深刻的了解。下马看花与走马看花是对立面的统一，在一定条件下，这两者所得就互相转化，点与面的经验互相结合，这就是辩证法。
    第二、要做到听与看相结合。调查研究的主要方式，是开调查会。我调查试验田，主要向三部分同志作调查，一是领导干部；二是群众；三是技术干部。试验田是三者结合，调查也应该三者结合。开调查会之前或之后，到田间去看试验田。听与看往往有矛盾，不能粗心大意，听到的与看到的往往有差别，差别就是矛盾，就要把它们弄清楚，解决矛盾，使听到的与看到的统一起来，得出正确的结论。
    第三、要做到外行与内行的统一。我对农村工作是外行。所以这次下乡，我是与当地有经验的同志一起去调查，我在襄阳检查工作时是与地委书记一起去检查的。他们有丰富的实际知识，对我帮助很大。而内行的人，因为他们对农村的许多事物看惯了，在我们觉得很新鲜的事情，他们有时并不觉得新鲜，我们这些外行人，把问题加以突出，对他们是有帮助的。内行与外行也是矛盾的统一，这也是辩证法。
    第四、要做到分析与综合的统一。我们研究问题，要尽可能掌握大量材料，但面对着一大堆材料，一大堆事物的现象，如何认识它的本质，就须要作分析的工夫。分析必须是系统周密的分析，对事物的各个部分都要有清楚的了解，从分析中暴露出事物的内部联系，然后综合起来，指明问题的性质和发展方向，这样我们对这个事物才会有本质的了解。
    要尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法，必须作调查研究，必须运用唯物辩证法观察问题、分析问题，学会“解剖一个或几个麻雀”。“麻雀”是客观存在，它与我们的主观认识也是对立面的统一，如果我们不去解剖它，是不能与我们的主观认识统一起来的。“解剖麻雀”，就是使主观正确反映客观，就是使主观与客观相一致。主观与客观相一致，就能正确指导工作，不然就会犯主观主义。因此，我们在贯彻执行我党八届二次会议所规定的建设社会主义的总路线时，千万不要轻视“解剖一个或几个麻雀”的工作。
