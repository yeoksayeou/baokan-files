Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, the "Red Flag" newspaper, published an article today calling on the Japanese people to launch a national movement to thoroughly investigate the Nobusuke Kishi government's anti-China policy, in order to break the deadlock in current Sino-Japanese exchanges.

The article pointed out that currently, in Sino-Japanese relations, not only has trade come to a complete standstill, but exchanges in other areas have also been completely halted. Under these circumstances, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party continue to adhere to their anti-China policy, and their frequent statements about maintaining a so-called "wait-and-see" attitude are a concrete manifestation of this policy.

The article pointed out that the complete standstill in Sino-Japanese trade has already brought serious consequences to all sectors. Therefore, simply petitioning to demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade cannot solve the problem. It is necessary to unite and launch a broad national movement to mobilize public opinion and urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to thoroughly change its anti-China policy. Only in this way can the deadlock in Sino-Japanese exchanges be broken.

On the same day, the "Red Flag" also published an interview with former Japanese Communist Party Diet member Kanichi Kawakami by a reporter from the newspaper. He pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party should actively explain to the Japanese people the reasons for the complete standstill in Sino-Japanese exchanges, expose the reactionary anti-China policy adopted by the Nobusuke Kishi government, and strive to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, which insists on being an enemy of the 600 million Chinese people, is intensifying its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to reports, Nobusuke Kishi met with Huang Shao-gu, the "Vice President of the Executive Yuan" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who had long been spurned by the Chinese people, on the 3rd. During the meeting, Kishi expressed "positive and definite indications" regarding the future of the so-called Japanese-Chiang "diplomatic relations." At the same time, Huang Shao-gu expressed "respect and gratitude" for Kishi's "firm stance" in undermining the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

On the same day, Nobusuke Kishi also met with Tani Masatsugu, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's delegation to the third meeting of the Chiang-Japanese "Cooperation Promotion Committee" in Tokyo. Kishi reiterated to Tani Masatsugu his guarantee to support the Chiang-Japanese "Cooperation Promotion Committee," which is the greatest insult to the Chinese people, and vigorously expressed his desire to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia.

The "Cooperation Promotion Committee," composed of Chiang-Japanese reactionaries, has been holding its third meeting in Tokyo since the 4th to discuss issues related to the intensified collusion between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Nobusuke Kishi government in political, economic, and cultural fields. The first and second meetings of this committee were held in Tokyo and Taipei in April and October 1957, respectively.

    “赤旗报”号召日本人民
    追究岸政府敌视中国的政策
    岸信介加紧同蒋介石集团狼狈为奸
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表文章，号召日本人民展开国民运动，彻底追究岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，以打开目前日中往来陷入全面停顿的局面。
    文章指出，目前，在日中关系中，不仅贸易陷于全面停顿，在其他一些方面的往来也都陷入全面停止的状态。在这种情况下，岸信介政府和自由民主党仍然坚持敌视中国的政策，它们经常说要保持所谓“静观”的态度就是这种政策的具体表现。
    文章指出，日中贸易全面停顿已经为各方面带来严重的影响。因此，仅仅通过进行请愿来要求恢复日中贸易是不能解决问题的，而必须团结一致展开广泛的国民运动来动员舆论，促使岸信介政府彻底改变它的敌视中国的政策，只有这样才能打开日中往来陷入全面停顿的局面。
    同一天的“赤旗报”还刊登了日共前国会议员川上贯一向这家报纸记者发表的谈话。他指出，日本共产党今后要积极向日本人民阐明导致日中往来陷入全面停顿的原因，揭露岸信介政府采取敌视中国的反动政策，努力促使打开日中关系的僵持局面。
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：坚持同六亿中国人民为敌的日本岸信介政府，正在加紧同蒋介石集团进行勾结。
    据报道，岸信介在3日接见了早为中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团的“行政院副院长”黄少谷。在接见时，岸信介曾经对所谓日蒋“邦交”前途问题，有“积极而确切的表示”。同时，黄少谷对岸信介在破坏日中贸易协定问题上所采取的“坚定立场”表示“尊重和感谢”。
    同一天，岸信介还接见了到东京参加蒋日“合作策进委员会”第三次会议的蒋介石集团的代表团团长谷正纲。岸信介向谷正纲重申保证支持对中国人民最大侮辱的蒋日“合作策进委员会”，并且极力表示要勾结蒋介石集团在东南亚进行经济扩张。
    由蒋日反动派组成的“合作策进委员会”已经从4日起在东京举行第三次会议，讨论蒋介石集团和岸信介政府在政治、经济、文化等方面加紧勾结的有关问题。这个委员会的第一、二次会议是在1957年4月和10月分别在东京和台北举行的。
