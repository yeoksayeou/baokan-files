Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: The general line for propagating socialist construction in the capital reached its climax today. Today, over 20,000 report speakers were dispatched throughout the city, and the entire propaganda force numbered over 70,000. More than two million people have already heard reports on the general line. In the Xuanwu, Chongwen, and Xicheng districts of the city, the general line has been basically made known to every household. Cadres from all government agencies, workers from factories and mines, and teachers and students from universities and middle schools have basically all received education on the general line.

The reports on the general line have inspired the heroic spirit and creative power of the working class in the capital a hundredfold. At a rally to implement the general line, workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant requested to undertake all preparatory work for a giant power station to be built in the outskirts of Beijing. They said that although the new power station is more than ten times larger than their current plant, under the glorious guidance of the general line, they have the strength and means to overcome those difficulties. Workers at the Beijing Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 1, who have worked hard and diligently to produce the world-renowned "Feili Silk," planned to increase the number of varieties they produce from seven to fifty after hearing the report.

After hearing the report on the general line, cadres at the district and township levels broadened their horizons and further clarified their ideas for vigorously developing district and township industries. The Zhoukoudian District Committee originally planned to increase the number of district and township factories and mines from 76 to 247 this year. After hearing the report, Xie Deyuan, the Party Branch Secretary of Nanzhao Township in this district, said that he now had twelve times the enthusiasm. Based on the specific conditions of his township, before the wheat harvest, all twenty agricultural cooperatives in the township must establish a plant for processing roughage.

Propaganda activities in the rural areas near the capital have blossomed everywhere today. The general line has greatly encouraged farmers who are fighting drought to ensure a good harvest. After hearing the report from Wang Jingming, the District Party Secretary representing the district at the "Eighth National Congress," more than 2,000 members of the Junmin Youyi Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Fanjiacun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District were even more determined to fight the drought. The members go to the fields at five o'clock in the morning and work until one o'clock in the morning, saying, "The heavens cannot scare us; we must ensure a good harvest no matter how dry it is!" The district has begun to organize a comprehensive inspection of work throughout the district to conscientiously implement the general line.

After hearing the report, many teachers and students in universities and colleges conducted discussions in connection with their teaching and learning. At the discussion meeting, Gao Wentai, the old professor and director of the Coalfield Geology Department of the Beijing Mining College, spoke on behalf of all the teachers and students in the department, saying, "We must plant the red flag of the general line throughout the department and turn the entire department into a red department."

　　首都宣传总路线进入高潮
    人民的创造精神百倍焕发
    新华社31日讯　首都宣传社会主义建设总路线今天进入高潮。今天全市出动的报告员有两万多人，全部宣传大军有七万多人，已有二百多万人听到了总路线的传达报告，城区的宣武、崇文、西城等三个区，已经基本上做到家喻户晓。全市各机关的干部、厂矿企业的职工、大、中学校的师生基本上全部受到了总路线的教育。
    总路线的传达报告，使首都工人阶级的英雄气概和创造精神百倍焕发。石景山发电厂职工在贯彻执行总路线的誓师大会上，要求包下即将在京郊兴建的一个巨型电站的全部筹建工作，他们说：新建的电站虽然比他们的电厂大十几倍，但在总路线的光辉照耀下，他们有力量有办法克服那些困难。穷干苦干，制造出闻名国外的“飞利绸”的北京染织一厂职工，听到报告后，计划把现在生产的品种由七种增加到五十种。
    各个区乡干部听到总路线的报告后，眼界更加开阔，大办区乡工业的思想更加明确了。周口店区委会今年原计划把区乡厂矿由七十六个发展到二百四十七个。这个区的南召乡党支部书记谢德园听了传达后说：他现在有了十二分的干劲，根据本乡的具体条件，在麦收前，全乡二十个农业社，一定要做到每个社都建立起一个粗饲料加工厂。
    首都近郊农村的宣传活动，今天已经普遍开花。总路线大大鼓舞了正在抗旱保丰收的农民。丰台区军民友谊农业生产合作社和樊家村农业生产合作社的两千多名社员，听了“八大”代表该区区委书记王景铭的传达报告后，与干旱斗争的决心更强了。社员们清晨五点钟下地，一直干到深夜一点才回家，他们说：“老天爷吓不住我们，再旱也得保丰收！”这个区已开始着手组织全区工作大检查，切实贯彻总路线。
    许多高等学校的师生，在听了报告后，纷纷结合自己的教学和学习进行了讨论。北京矿业学院煤田地质系主任高文泰老教授在讨论会上代表全系师生发言说：“一定要把总路线的红旗插遍全系，把全系变成一个红系。”
