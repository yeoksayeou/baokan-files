　　On the "Earthiness" of "Native Experts"
　　He Ming
　　"Native" is in contrast to "Foreign." In the old days, there were terms like "foreign-style bun" and "native bun." The term "native bun" carried a sense of disparagement, and the "native bun" himself felt a little inferior. Now, there are so-called "native experts" (which naturally implies "foreign experts"), like Li Shimei, who invented a new method for preventing and controlling termites. The newspaper calls him a "native expert." I think this term no longer carries a sense of disparagement, at least in the minds of many people. However, I feel it is necessary to discuss the "earthiness" of "native experts" further.
    What does it mean to call an "expert" "native"?
    Is it because he has inventions and creations, but has not attended university, has not studied abroad, has not entered a research institute, and has no degree, that he is called a "native expert"? There is such an understanding: he has not attended university, has not studied abroad... he is unsophisticated, so a "native" character must be added before "expert." While acknowledging him as "expert" and "authority," he is still "native," "expert" but "unsophisticated," "authority" but "parochial" (never seen the world); this is still disparaging. Li Shimei, a "native expert," has not attended university, has not studied abroad... this is an objective fact. However, I believe this is not the essential characteristic of a "native expert," nor should it be regarded as the essential difference between "native experts" and "foreign experts."
    "Native expert" is an honorable title. "Native" refers to "foreign experts" who are foreignized and don't understand China's reality. The "earthiness" of "native experts" lies in their being rooted in the "soil." Timber, cotton, grain... grow out of the soil, gold, silver, copper, iron, tin... are dug out of the soil. Their knowledge comes from delving into these earthy matters, and they serve these earthy matters. How can they not be "native"? Therefore, they should rightly be called "native experts." Would it be alright if they didn't have this "earthiness"? Here, I have no intention of disparaging "experts" who have studied abroad. Scientific knowledge has nothing to do with being foreign or native. Studying abroad and systematically learning scientific knowledge is a good thing, isn't it? Returning and rooting oneself in the soil of China, serving production according to China's conditions, and conducting research based on production practice, what is foreign about that? If one has studied abroad, or has not studied abroad, but only remembers the foreign formulas and foreign dogmas in foreign books, disregards China's reality, only reads foreign books, and cannot even conduct experiments without foreign equipment, that is a great pity. In such people, only foreignness remains. What about "expertise"? Because "heroes have no opportunity to display their prowess," they will rust over time; as for those who were only foreign and not expert in the first place, there is even less to say.
    Li Shimei's invention of a new method for preventing and controlling termites is said to have exceeded international standards—at least there is no doubt that his method is particularly effective!—this matter is worth our careful consideration. Li Shimei does not have much book knowledge, but he has made such an invention with scientific and practical value, mainly because he has no foreignness but has earthiness, and has rooted himself in the soil of China. Foreigners, in our eyes, are "foreign people"; foreign experts, in our eyes, are "foreign experts." In fact, "foreign experts" who truly have inventions and creations also have some earthiness of their own country, and their roots are also in the soil.
    I am not belittling book knowledge. "Native experts" who lack book knowledge also need to make up for their lack of scientific theoretical knowledge. However, they have no need to learn foreignness and abandon earthiness. The "earthiness" of "native experts" is a great advantage. "Experts" who do not have enough "earthiness" need to learn more "earthiness" and firmly root themselves in the soil of production practice. "Foreignness" must be removed. "Native experts" should not feel inferior because of "earthiness." Whether in China or abroad, in the past or present, it has been proven: "Long live 'native experts'!"

### 论“土专家”之“土”

　　论“土专家”之“土”
　　何明
    “土”对“洋”而言。老早以前就有“洋包子”、“土包子”的称呼。“土包子”的称呼含有卑薄之意；而“土包子”本人也有点自卑。现在又有所谓“土专家”（当然也即有“洋专家”了），发明防治白蚁的新方法的李始美，报上就称呼他是“土专家”。我想，这个称呼是没有卑薄的意思了，至少在不少人的心目中是这样。但是，我觉得对“土专家”之“土”，还有议论一番的必要。
    “专家”而名之曰“土”是什么意思呢？
    是因为他有发明创造，但没有进过大学、没有留过洋、没有进过研究院、没有什么学位，而称之曰“土专家”吗？有这样一种理解：没有进过大学、没有留过洋……土里土气，所以要在“专家”之上加一个“土”字。承认其为“专”为“家”，然而却“土”，“专”而“土气”，“家”而“家乡气”（未见过大世面也）；这还是卑薄的意思。像李始美这样的“土专家”没有进过大学，没有留过洋……，这是客观事实。然而，我以为这不是“土专家”的本质特征；也不应该把这当作“土专家”和“洋专家”的本质区别。
    “土专家”是一个光荣称呼。“土”者，针对洋里洋气不懂中国实际的“洋专家”而言也。“土专家”之“土”，在于他生根于“土”。木材、棉花、粮食……是从土里长出来的，金、银、铜、铁、锡……是从土里刨出来的。他就是从这等土事里边钻出来的学问，而且就是为这些土事服务的。怎么不“土”？所以理应叫作“土专家”。如果没有这么一点“土”气还行？这里，我丝毫也没有卑薄留过洋的“专家”的意思。科学知识没有什么洋的、土的？留过洋，系统的学习了科学知识，这还不是好事？回来，把根生在中国的土壤上，根据中国的条件为生产服务，在生产实践的基础上进行研究，这有什么洋气？如果留过洋，或者是没有留过洋，但是只记住了洋书本上的洋公式、洋教条，不问中国实际，单读洋书，甚至没有洋设备连试验也不能做，那是大可悲哀的。在这种人身上大抵只剩下了洋气，“专”呢？因为“英雄不肯用武”，久而久之也锈了；至于原本就只洋而不专者，就更不用说了。
    李始美发明防治白蚁的新方法，据说超过了国际水平——至少他的方法特别有效，是没有疑义的吧！——这件事是值得我们很好地加以思索的。李始美书本知识不多，而作了这样有科学价值和实用价值的发明，主要地就在于他没有洋气，而有土气，把根生在了中国的土壤上。外国人，在我们看来是“洋人”；外国的专家在我们看来是“洋专家”。其实，真正有发明创造的“洋专家”，他们也是有他们本国的一些土气的，他们的根也是生在土上的。
    我并非轻视书本知识。缺乏书本知识的“土专家”也是需要补习科学理论知识的。但是，他们却完全没有必要学洋气，去土气。“土专家”的“土气”是极大的优点。“土气”还不多的“专家”，倒是需要多学点“土气”，把根结结实实地扎在生产实践的土上。“洋气”非得去掉不可。“土专家”不要因为“土”而自卑，不论中国还是外国，过去还是现在，都在证明：“土专家”万岁！
