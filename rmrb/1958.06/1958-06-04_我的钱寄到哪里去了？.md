    Where Did My Money Go?
    On September 15th of last year, I sent 30 yuan in RMB to my home in Shengzhuang Village, Yanshi County, Henan Province, through the Qin County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Shanxi. It has been more than eight months, and my family has not yet received it. Because of this matter, I have repeatedly inquired with the Qin County Post Office, and the Qin County Post Office has also repeatedly inquired with the Yanshi Post Office for investigation, but so far there is still no news. Where exactly did my money go? I hope the above two post offices will quickly investigate and find it.

    我的钱寄到哪里去了？
    去年9月15日，我通过山西沁县邮电局往河南省偃师县省庄村家中寄去人民币三十元，到现在已八个多月，家中还没有收到。为这件事，我曾多次催问沁县邮局，沁县邮局也多次向偃师邮局询问追查，但到目前仍然没有下落。我的钱究竟寄到哪里去了呢？希望上述两邮局迅速给查到。
