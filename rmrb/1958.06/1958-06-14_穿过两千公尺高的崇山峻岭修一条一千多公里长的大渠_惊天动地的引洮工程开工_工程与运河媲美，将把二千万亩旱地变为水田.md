This newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch on the 13th: Reporter Zhai Qiyin reports: The 引洮 (Yǐn Táo - Directing the Tao River) irrigation project in Gansu Province, comparable to China's great Grand Canal, has recently commenced ahead of schedule. This is a brilliant banner for the people of Gansu in actively implementing the general line of socialism, breaking superstitions, daring to think and act, and fearlessly conquering nature and transforming mountains and rivers.

The 引洮 project starts from Gucheng Village, 20 kilometers north of Minxian County in southern Gansu Province, diverting the waters of the Tao River up the Minshan Mountains, passing through towering mountains and ridges such as the Benzhai Ridge, Jiudian Gorge, Nanping Mountain, Guanshan Mountain, Huajialing Mountain, Yueliang Mountain, and Quwu Mountain, which are over two thousand meters above sea level. The height difference of the canal is between 250 and 400 meters. It extends north to Xingrenbao in Jingyuan County and east to the Dongzhi Plateau in the mountainous area of eastern Gansu. The main canal is 1,130 kilometers long, and the 19 branch canals total 2,500 kilometers. The main canal is 40 meters wide and has a flow rate of 150 cubic meters per second, with a maximum of 170 cubic meters per second. It can transform 15 million to 20 million mu of arid land in 23 counties and cities into paddy fields, and can also accommodate boats and rafts for 500 kilometers. Therefore, it is not only a huge irrigation canal, but also a mountain canal.

Building such a magnificent water conservancy project was unimaginable even half a year ago. Two years ago, although some people in individual counties had proposed the "引洮济渭 (Yǐn Táo Jì Wèi - Directing the Tao River to Aid the Wei River)" suggestion, it did not receive widespread support. Last year, the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was widely disseminated throughout the province, liberating people's minds and setting off a high tide of water conservancy construction. In February of this year, the Second Provincial Party Congress of Gansu Province thoroughly eliminated the influence of the "Gansu is Backward" theory, criticized the right-leaning views of the "skeptics" and "wait-and-see" individuals who claimed "there is no money, no labor force, no technical personnel, and large-scale construction cannot be carried out," aroused the revolutionary spirit of the people of the entire province, and held high the red flag of communism to march towards nature. At this time, in Gansu, where droughts and disasters were frequent and barren mountains and ridges crisscrossed, more than 5,000 mountain-climbing irrigation canals appeared, expanding the water area by more than 12 million mu, which is more than twice the amount of water area built in the thousands of years before liberation.

Under this revolutionary situation, the Dingxi Special Zone proposed the 引洮 (Yǐn Táo - Directing the Tao River) plan, which immediately received the support of the province and various special zones related to this project. Subsequently, the province immediately organized technical forces from all aspects to conduct reconnaissance work in the face of the severe cold before the Spring Festival. After preliminary design, this project was originally scheduled to start construction at the end of June, but under the encouragement of the general line of socialist construction proposed at the Second Session of the Eighth Party Congress, it started ahead of schedule in early June.

The 引洮 project is located in the most arid central and eastern regions of Gansu, with little rainfall and deep water levels. Droughts have been continuous for two thousand years, and the cycles are becoming increasingly frequent, with "nine droughts in ten years." After the high tide of water conservancy construction this year, only the 4 million people and more than 20 million mu of land here cannot finally get rid of the threat of drought. After the completion of the 引洮 project, all the land in this area will be water conservancy. The 15 million to 20 million mu of land irrigated by this project, calculated at an increase of 300 jin of grain per mu, can increase grain production by 4.5 billion to 6 billion jin per year, which is more than half of the total grain output of Gansu Province in 1957. At the same time, this will also cause a series of changes: the drinking water problem of more than 4 million people and tens of millions of livestock along the route will be completely solved; the speed of greening can be accelerated; the grassland can be expanded by 11 million mu, increasing the number of livestock by more than 200,000; the water storage project can also be used to develop aquaculture on a large scale; and the head difference of the canal can be used to build hydropower stations, which can generate 400,000 kilowatts of electricity, accelerating the electrification of the region. Therefore, the 引洮 project is not an ordinary construction, but the last siege of drought by the people of Gansu, and a huge material guarantee for realizing the forty articles of the agricultural development program and enabling farmers to live a happy life.

The entire canal project is very difficult and complex. The canal has to pass through 100 tunnels and 1,400 bridges across rivers and ditches. For example, the Guanshan Xinzhai Tunnel is 4.9 kilometers long, which is rare in China's tunnel history. Regarding the series of technical difficulties that will be encountered in the construction process, such as the seepage of the loess layer of the entire canal, the people of Gansu Province will rely on the wisdom of the masses to solve them. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also sent an engineering and technical team in late May to cooperate with the 引洮 Project Bureau to mobilize the masses and adopt the principle of experimenting, working, and learning at the same time, in order to quickly solve this technical problem that has not yet been completely solved nationwide.

In order to speed up the construction of the 引洮 project, the entire project adopts the method of comprehensive survey, unified planning, segmented measurement, segmented design, and segmented construction. At the same time, in accordance with the principle of "民办公助 (mín bàn gōng zhù - people-run and government-assisted)", the masses are fully mobilized to use their own manpower, materials, and financial resources to build. The section under construction this year is the 330-kilometer section from Gucheng in Minxian County to Dayingliang in Longxi County, with a planned investment of 14 million yuan, of which 12 million yuan is raised by the masses. At present, tens of thousands of laborers from various beneficiary counties in the Dingxi Special Zone have rushed to ten construction sites for intense labor, and the number will gradually increase to 200,000 in July to ensure the completion of this project within two years.

    穿过两千公尺高的崇山峻岭修一条一千多公里长的大渠
    惊天动地的引洮工程开工
    工程与运河媲美，将把二千万亩旱地变为水田
    本报兰州13日电　记者翟其寅报道：可与我国伟大运河媲美的甘肃引洮（河）上山水利工程，最近提前开工。这是甘肃人民积极贯彻社会主义总路线，破除迷信，敢想敢干，不畏困难地征服自然、改造山河的一面光辉的旗帜。
    引洮工程，从甘肃省南部岷县城北二十公里处的古城村开始，把洮河的水引上岷山，穿过海拔两千多公尺的本寨岭、九甸峡、南屏山、关山、华家岭、月亮山、曲雾山等崇山峻岭，渠道的比高为二百五十到四百公尺，北到靖远的兴仁堡，东到陇东山匿区的董志塬。总干渠全长一千一百三十公里，十九条干渠总长二千五百公里，总干渠渠面宽四十公尺，引水量一百五十秒公方，最大时可达一百七十秒公方，可把二十三个县市的一千五百到二千万亩旱地变为水田，同时可以通行船筏五百公里。因此，它不仅是一条巨大的灌溉渠道，也是一条山上运河。
    建设这样规模宏伟的水利工程，在半年以前还是没有人敢于想像的。两年以前，在个别县里虽曾经有人提出“引洮济渭（河）”的建议，但是得不到广泛的支持。去年，全省广泛传达了八届三中全会的精神，解放了人们思想，在全省内掀起了修水利的高潮。今年2月间，甘肃省地方二届党代表大会，彻底清除了“甘肃落后论”的影响，批判“怀疑派”、“观潮派”者所谓“没有钱，没有劳动力，没有技术人材，不能搞大建设”的右倾观点，鼓起了全省人民的革命干劲，高举起共产主义的红旗向大自然进军。这时，在干旱多灾、童山秃岭纵横的甘肃，出现了引水上山的渠道五千余条，扩大水地一千二百余万亩，等于解放前几千年修水地的两倍多。
    在这个革命形势下，定西专区提出了引洮方案，立即得到省里和与这一工程有关的各专区的支持。接着，省里立即组织各方面技术力量，冒着春节前的严寒进行勘查工作。经过初步设计，这一工程原计划6月底开工，但在党的八届二次大会提出的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，提前在6月初开工了。
    引洮工程沿线是甘肃最干旱的中东部地区，雨水少，水位深，两千年来旱灾连续不断，周期愈来愈密，“十年九旱”。经过今年的兴修水利的高潮后，全省唯有这里的四百多万人口、二千余万亩土地还不能最后摆脱干旱的威胁。引洮工程竣工后，就能把这一带的土地全部水利化。这项工程灌溉的一千五百至二千万亩地，以每亩增产粮食三百斤计算，每年可增产四十五至六十亿斤粮食，等于甘肃全省1957年粮食总产量的一半多。同时这里还将引起一系列的变化：沿线四百多万人口和千万头牲畜的饮水问题将得到彻底解决；可以加速绿化的速度；可以扩大草原一千一百万亩，增养牲畜二十多万头；利用蓄水工程还能大量发展水产；利用渠道落差建设水电站，可发电四十万瓩，加速这个地区的电气化。因此引洮工程不是一项寻常的建设，而是甘肃人民向干旱最后的一次围剿，是实现发展农业纲要四十条，使农民过幸福生活的巨大物质保证。
    整个渠道工程是十分艰巨复杂的，渠道要穿越一百座隧道，要建筑越河跨沟的建筑一千四百座。像关山新寨隧洞，长达四点九公里，在我国隧道史上也是少有的。对于施工中将遇到技术上的一系列困难，例如整个渠道的黄土层渗漏等问题，甘肃省人民将依靠群策群力来解决。中国科学院也在5月下旬派了一个工程技术队，协同引洮工程局发动群众，采取边试验，边干，边学习的原则，以求迅速解决这个全国尚未全部解决的技术问题。
    为加快引洮工程的建设速度，整个工程采取全线查勘，统一规划，分段测量，分段设计，分段施工的方法。同时按照“民办公助”的原则，充分动员群众用自己的人力、物力、财力去兴建。今年施工的地段是岷县古城到陇西大营梁的一段三百三十公里，计划投资一千四百万元，其中群众集资一千二百万元。现在定西专区各受益县，已有几万劳动大军赶至十个工程地段进行紧张劳动，7月份将逐渐增加到二十万人，保证在两年内完成这项工程。
