    Don't Absolutize
    Xiao Zhe
    In the article "Don't Understand Thriftiness One-Sidedly" (see May 4th edition of this paper), I once said: "Some people mention 'don't buy what can be bought or not bought.' I think if there is such a need in personal life, but it is not very urgent, it can be bought or not bought. If you have extra money and the supply of such goods is currently sufficient, you can buy it; otherwise, don't buy it. ... Absolutely not buying what can be bought or not bought may not be beneficial to social production." Some people disagree with this view. The main difference between us lies in the word "absolute." I do not advocate "absolute" non-buying, but rather decide "to buy" or "not to buy" according to the actual situation of needs and possibilities. They advocate absolute non-buying. Do you have money? It's best to deposit all of it in the bank or buy government bonds, which is more beneficial to production; is the supply of goods sufficient? That can also be saved, they say, "isn't a reservoir for storing water"?
    I first doubt how this "absolute" non-buying can be achieved in general. What we call "can be bought or not bought" is of course based on need as the main standard. Otherwise, besides contraband, you can't find anything that can't be bought. Then, the problem comes. Is it possible to wait until a piece of clothing is completely unwearable before buying another one? I don't think many people go to the store naked to buy clothes. The so-called "can be bought or not bought" means that there is a flexibility in this need: it is needed with it, and it can be without it temporarily; but it is not absolutely unnecessary. Absolute unnecessity belongs to the category of resolutely not buying. Then, in this case, with ample money at hand and ample goods in the store, why can't you buy one at any time?
    Thrift and frugality are originally good things that should be vigorously promoted, but the problem is that some people have absolutized them and used this absolutized principle to judge others, saying that buying another piece of clothing when "the clothes can still be worn" is a waste. This may not be correct. My previous opinion was precisely aimed at this situation. Of course, this is not to say that if you have one, you must "absolutely" buy another one.
    Accumulation and savings cannot be absolutized either. Thinking that all money should be 100% accumulated and saved is a too naive idea. Reservoirs can store water, but storing water is a means, not an end. The purpose is for the water to be used by people and be beneficial to people. Otherwise, why is building reservoirs also called water conservancy construction? If it is only stored and not used, there will always be a day when it "overflows," and it will not be able to be stored "absolutely." Just assuming it can be stored, the water will eventually become a stagnant pool, mildew and rot, breed mosquitoes, and spread diseases, which is turning water conservancy into water damage. Let's imagine: if there is a large reservoir on the left, storing all the money; and a large reservoir on the right, storing all the goods. Both reservoirs are full, but neither generating electricity nor irrigating, leaving the crops drought-stricken, what an absurd thing this is. Therefore, accumulation and savings should be promoted, and everyone should participate. But overemphasizing savings, neglecting necessary consumption, and affecting production development is not good. Of course, we cannot therefore accept the principle that life is above all else. In short, don't make it too absolute.
    I say it again, the policies of building the country through diligence and thrift, running communes through diligence and thrift, and managing households through diligence and thrift cannot be doubted and must be resolutely implemented; the bourgeois ideology of pursuing personal enjoyment among young people and the bourgeois lifestyle they express must be criticized. This is something that cannot be conceded or wavered in the slightest. But a clear line should be drawn to tell everyone how to treat life with the correct attitude. I think that from a local perspective, occasional tightness and looseness in living supplies are inevitable, but from a global and whole-process perspective, maintaining a situation that can both establish a frugal atmosphere and allow people to purchase consumer goods according to personal needs and possibilities is possible. Maintaining the constant activity of social purchasing power will be a good thing for the country and for individuals. As long as we can consciously restrain demand and work harder when supplies are tight, and not squander and waste when supplies are abundant. And this requires careful ideological education, not interference in daily life.

### 不要绝对化

    不要绝对化
    萧哲
    在“不要片面理解勤俭持家”（见5月4日本版）一文里，我曾经说过：“有人提到‘可买可不买者的不买’。我倒认为，如果个人生活上有这种需要，但又不是十分紧迫的话，可以买也可以不买。如果手边有多余的钱，而这种商品当前的供应量又很充足，就可以买；否则，就不买。……可买可不买的绝对不买，未必就对社会生产有利。”有人不同意这种看法。我们之间的主要分歧在“绝对”二字上。我不主张“绝对”的不买，而是依照需要和可能两个方面的实际情况决定“买”或“不买”。他们则主张绝对的不买。你有钱吗？全部存入银行或购买公债好了，这对生产更为有利；商品供应量很充足吗？那也可以存起来，他们说，“水库不是可以储水的吗”？
    我首先怀疑，在一般情况下，这“绝对”的不买，怎样能作到。我们所说的“可买可不买”，当然是以需要作为主要标准的。否则除了违禁品以外，再也找不到不可买的东西。那末，问题就来了。可不可能，非等一件衣服穿得完全不能遮体的时候才去买另一件？我看很少有人光着屁股到商店去买衣服的。所谓“可买可不买”，是说对这种需要有一个伸缩性：有了也需要，暂时没有也可以；而并不是绝对的不需要。绝对的不需要是属于坚决不买之列的。那末，在这种情况下，手边有宽裕的钱，商店里有宽裕的货，为什么不可以随时去买一件？
    勤俭节约本来是一件应该大力提倡的好事，问题就在于有人把它绝对化了，而且拿这种绝对化了的原则，又去套别人，说他“衣服还能穿，又买了一件”是浪费了。这就未必是正确的了。我上次的意见正是针对这种情况的。当然这不是说，有了一件，非“绝对”的再买一件不可。
    关于积累和储蓄，也不能绝对化。认为所有的钱百分之百的积累和储蓄起来才算好，是一种过于天真的想法。水库是可以把水储起来的，但是水库储水是一种手段，并不是一种目的。目的是要这水为人所用，对人有利。不然为什么把修水库又叫作兴修水利呢？倘只是储而不用，总会有“满则溢”的一天，哪里能“绝对”的储得住。就假设能储住吧，那水久之也会变成一洼死水，发霉生腐，孳生蚊虫，传染疾病，这又是变水利为水害了。试来设想一下：如果左边一个大水库，把钱都储存起来；右边一个大水库，把商品都储存起来。两个水库都是满荡荡的，可是既不发电也不灌溉，一任那庄稼干旱着，这是多么荒唐的事。所以积累和储蓄应该提倡，也应当人人动手。但过分强调储蓄，忽略必要的消费，影响生产发展，那就不好了。当然，我们不能因此就接受那种生活高于一切的原则。总之不要弄得太绝对化。
    我再说一遍，勤俭建国，勤俭办社，勤俭持家的方针不能怀疑，必须坚决贯彻；对于青年中的追求个人享受的资产阶级思想，以及他们所表露的资产阶级生活方式，必须批判。这是丝毫不能让步和动摇的。但是应该鲜明地划清界限，告诉大家如何去用正确态度对待生活。我想，从局部看，生活供应上的有时紧有时松，虽是不可避免的，但从全体和全程看，保持一个既能树立勤俭的风气，又能按照个人需要和可能去购买消费品，是可能的。保持社会购买力的经常活跃，这对国家对个人都会是一件好事。只要我们能够在供应较紧时，自觉克制需求，而勤奋倍加；在供应充裕时，又不挥霍浪费奢侈就行了。而这需要的是细致的思想教育，绝不是对日常生活的干涉。
