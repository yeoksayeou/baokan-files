Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 25th: The location of the Soviet Antarctic scientific base "Mirny" is not on the coast of the Antarctic continent, but on an island 400 kilometers away from the real Antarctic coastline, according to an article published today in the Soviet newspaper "Pravda."

The "Pravda" article summarized some of the major achievements of the Soviet Antarctic Comprehensive Expedition. The article pointed out that preliminary survey results obtained in the area adjacent to the Indian Ocean in Antarctica showed that at the 27th kilometer, the ice layer was about 1,000 meters thick, while at the 375th kilometer, the thickness reached about 3,500 meters. Whether Antarctica is a continent or an archipelago has not yet been definitively resolved. What can be confirmed at present is that if the continent exists, its area is not equal to the area of the Antarctic ice sheet, but is much smaller than what is stated in modern geography books.

Another conclusion can now be drawn. At the beginning of the 20th century, Antarctic explorer David believed that the average thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet was 550 meters, so if the Antarctic ice sheet were to melt completely, the Earth's ocean surface would rise by 15 meters. According to current data calculations, the ocean surface would rise by approximately 45 meters.

Interesting data has also been obtained regarding Antarctic temperatures. On June 19 this year, the Soviet Antarctic "Vostok" scientific station recorded a minimum temperature of minus 81.2 degrees Celsius. Never before has anyone lived under such low-temperature conditions.

The latest high-altitude meteorological surveys show that the total amount of solar heat reaching the surface of Antarctica in summer is almost twice as much as in mid-latitude regions. This data refutes the notion that the total radiation in the polar regions in summer is less than in temperate regions.

The expedition's zoologists' investigations into the distribution patterns of local animals and birds have shown that the number of animals in certain areas of Antarctica is very large. On Haswell Island, approximately 20,000 various birds inhabit each square kilometer.

The data obtained by the Soviet expedition refutes past concepts that considered the ocean floor surrounding Antarctica to be a flat or gently undulating area. The data proves that this ocean floor is an ancient Gondwana continent that has sunk into the sea, a continent that once connected eastern Antarctica with Africa and western Australia.

### 苏联南极考察队成就重大  探明南极周围洋底原是下沉的古代大陆

    苏联南极考察队成就重大
    探明南极周围洋底原是下沉的古代大陆
    据新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联南极科学基地“和平村”的所在地并不是南极大陆的海岸，而是离南极大陆真正的海岸还有四百公里的一个海岛，这是苏联“真理报”今天发表的一篇文章说的。
    “真理报”文章对苏联南极综合考察队所取得的重大成就作了某些总结。文章指出，在南极大陆邻近印度洋一带地区获得的初步考察结果表明，在第二十七公里处，冰层厚度约为一千公尺，而在第三百七十五公里处厚度就达到了三千五百公尺左右。至于南极洲究竟是大陆还是群岛，这个问题还未最后解决。目前可以肯定的是，如果大陆是存在的，那末它的面积并不等于南极冰层的面积，而是比现代地理书上所说的要小得多。
    现在还可以作出另一个结论。二十世纪初，南极考察家戴维认为，南极冰层的平均厚度是五百五十公尺，因此，如果南极冰层全部溶化，地球的洋面将升高十五公尺。而根据目前材料计算，洋面大约要升高四十五公尺。
    在南极气温方面也获得了有趣的材料。今年6月19日，南极“苏维埃”科学站纪录到了零下八十一点二度的最低温度。在过去还从来没有一个人在这样低的温度条件下生活过。
    最新的高空气象考察表明，夏天到达南极大陆表面的太阳热能总和比中纬地区几乎多一倍。这些材料驳斥了两极地区夏天总辐射量少于温带地区的意见。
    考察队的动物学家对当地的动物和鸟兽分布的规律所作的考察表明，在南极某些地区，动物的数量很大。在哈斯威尔岛上，每一平方公里的面积内就栖居了各种各样的鸟约二万只。
    苏联考察队所获的材料驳斥了过去的概念，过去认为南极周围的洋底是一片平坦的或起伏不大的地区。而材料证明，这块洋底乃是一块业已沉入海底的古代冈德万纳大陆，这个大陆曾经把南极洲东部同非洲和澳大利亚西部联接起来。
