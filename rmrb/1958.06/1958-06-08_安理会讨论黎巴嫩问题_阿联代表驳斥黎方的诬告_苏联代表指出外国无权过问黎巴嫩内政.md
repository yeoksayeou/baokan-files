Xinhua News Agency, June 7th Dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 6th to discuss Lebanon's accusation of the United Arab Republic's "interference in Lebanese internal affairs."

　　The Council heard statements from representatives of both Lebanon and the United Arab Republic.

　　Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik, in his speech, tried his best to slander the United Arab Republic, insisting that the United Arab Republic was carrying out "large-scale, illegal, and unwarranted interference" in Lebanese internal affairs. Malik demanded that the Security Council take measures to stop the United Arab Republic's so-called interference.

　　United Arab Republic representative Lutfi refuted Malik's slander. Lutfi said: The United Arab Republic has not interfered in Lebanese internal affairs, and will not threaten Lebanon's independence, because Lebanon's independence is important to all Arab countries, including the United Arab Republic. He pointed out that the current domestic turmoil in Lebanon is an internal affair, and its cause is President Chamoun's intention to amend the constitution so that he can be re-elected. The Lebanese government's current accusation against the United Arab Republic is aimed at adding an international dimension to a purely internal problem in order to confuse world opinion and deceive the Lebanese people.

　　Lutfi pointed out that at the special meeting of the Arab League Council, Lebanon rejected a draft resolution supported by six Arab countries, which stipulated the necessary measures and the establishment of a fact-finding committee. He said that the Lebanese government did not take the Arab League Council's opinions seriously.

　　British representative Dixon, in his speech, tried to create the impression that Lebanon's "accusation" was well-founded.

　　United States representative Barco, the behind-the-scenes supporter of Lebanon's "accusation," said that the United States advocates that "all relevant parties" take measures to "maintain" so-called "respect" for Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.

　　Soviet representative Sobolev expressed preliminary views. He said that the Lebanese representative had not presented convincing evidence to prove that the United Arab Republic was interfering in Lebanese internal affairs.

　　Sobolev said that the Soviet Union believes that the right to solve the Lebanese issue belongs to the Lebanese people, and no other country has the right to interfere. He said that any attempt to use Lebanon's domestic events to interfere from the outside could cause serious consequences, not only for the fate of Lebanon and its independence, but also for the fate of peace in the Middle East.

　　Iraqi representative Jamali requested that the meeting be adjourned until the 10th so that national representatives would have the opportunity to study the statements of both parties. This suggestion was eventually adopted.

　　安理会讨论黎巴嫩问题
    阿联代表驳斥黎方的诬告
    苏联代表指出外国无权过问黎巴嫩内政
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会6日举行会议，讨论黎巴嫩提出的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉黎巴嫩内政的”控诉。
    理事会听取了黎巴嫩和阿拉伯联合共和国双方代表的发言。
    黎巴嫩外交部长马利克在发言时竭力诽谤阿拉伯联合共和国，硬说阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩内政进行“大规模的、非法的和无端的干涉”。马利克要求安全理事会采取措施来制止阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓干涉。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲驳斥了马利克的诽谤。卢特菲说：阿拉伯联合共和国没有干涉黎巴嫩内政，而且也不会威胁黎巴嫩的独立，因为黎巴嫩的独立对包括阿拉伯联合共和国在内的所有阿拉伯国家来说，都是重要的。他指出，黎巴嫩目前国内的动乱是一个内政问题，它的起因是总统夏蒙打算修改宪法以便他能够连任。黎巴嫩政府现在控诉阿拉伯联合共和国的目的是要给一个纯粹内部的问题加上国际色彩，以便混淆世界视听，欺骗黎巴嫩人民。
    卢特菲指出，在阿拉伯联盟理事会特别会议上，黎巴嫩拒绝了六个阿拉伯国家所支持的一项决议草案，这项决议草案规定了必要的措施以及设立一个事实调查委员会。他说，黎巴嫩政府对待阿拉伯联盟理事会的意见很不认真。
    英国代表狄克逊在发言中力图造成这样的印象：似乎黎巴嫩的“控诉”是有根据的。
    黎巴嫩“控诉”的幕后支持者美国的代表巴尔斯说，美国主张“一切有关方面”采取措施来“维护”所谓对黎巴嫩的独立和主权的“尊重”。
    苏联代表索波列夫表示了初步的意见。他说，黎巴嫩代表没有提出使人信服的证据来证明阿拉伯联合共和国是在干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    索波列夫说，苏联认为，解决黎巴嫩问题的权利属于黎巴嫩人民，其他任何一个国家无权过问。他说，任何打算利用黎巴嫩的国内事件来从外部进行干涉的企图，都可能引起严重的后果，这不但对黎巴嫩的命运和它的独立来说是如此，对中近东和平的命运来说也是如此。
    伊拉克代表贾马利要求会议休会到10日再开，以便各国代表有机会研究双方代表的发言，这个建议最后得到通过。
