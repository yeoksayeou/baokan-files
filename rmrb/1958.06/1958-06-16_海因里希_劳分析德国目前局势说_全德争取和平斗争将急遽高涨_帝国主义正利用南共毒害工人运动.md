Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 15th: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 13th the report on the work of the Political Bureau delivered by Heinrich Rau, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the party which closed on the 11th, according to a TASS report from Berlin on June 13th.

After analyzing the situation in Germany, Heinrich Rau emphasized that the party's program for peace, security, and the restoration of German unity to make it a peaceful and democratic country is gaining increasing support from the broad masses of the West German people. He said that the West German people's desire to oppose atomic armament is in profound contradiction with the revanchist military policy of the West German ruling group. He affirmed that there is currently a great possibility in West Germany to carry out the struggle for peace, and there is also the possibility of reaching agreements and taking joint action with Social Democratic comrades.

Heinrich Rau then talked about the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. He said that industrial production in the first four months of 1958 increased by 11.2% compared with the same period in 1957, which provides the possibility for overfulfilling the 1958 national economic plan.

Regarding the socialist transformation of agriculture, he mentioned that 675 new agricultural production cooperatives were established in the first quarter of 1958, with more than 27,800 new farmers joining the cooperatives.

Heinrich Rau finally talked about the issue of opposing modern revisionism. He said that, as shown in the program of the Yugoslav Communist League, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia adheres to a revisionist position on the most basic issues of Marxism-Leninism. He said that the revisionism of the Yugoslav leaders is being used by imperialist forces to poison the international workers' movement. Therefore, all Marxist-Leninist parties have spoken out. This is not only to denounce revisionist views, but also to strike back.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 14th: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 14th the report by Neumann, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, on the preparations for the Fifth Party Congress at the party's 36th Central Plenary Session, according to a TASS report from Berlin on June 14th.

Neumann said that the preparations for the Party Congress have gone far beyond the scope of the party and have become an important event for the working class and the masses of the people. He pointed out that the party's prestige among the working people is increasing day by day.

The reporter talked about the achievements made by party organizations at all levels across the country in re-electing leading bodies and holding party congresses. Party organizations at all levels unanimously supported the policies of the Central Committee.

Neumann said that during the meetings of primary party organizations, 310,000 party members were elected into the party's grass-roots leading organs.

The reporter analyzed in detail some of the shortcomings in the work that were exposed during the meetings and representative meetings of party organizations at all levels. He pointed out that there are still serious shortcomings in the party's work in trade unions. He warned against the tendency to underestimate the significance of the party's work in mass organizations. He called for a thorough improvement of the party's work in these organizations.

    海因里希·劳分析德国目前局势说
    全德争取和平斗争将急遽高涨
    帝国主义正利用南共毒害工人运动
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社柏林13日讯：“新德意志报”13日刊载了德国统一社会党中央政治局委员海因里希·劳在11日闭幕的统一社会党中央全会上所作的政治局工作报告。
    海因里希·劳在分析了德国的形势之后，着重指出，党所制定的关于和平、安全和恢复德国统一使它成为一个和平民主国家的纲领正越来越得到西德广大人民的支持。他说，西德大多数人民反对原子武装的意愿同西德统治集团的复仇主义军事政策有深刻的矛盾。他肯定地说，目前在西德存在着开展争取和平斗争的巨大可能性，同时也存在着同社会民主党同志达成协议和采取共同行动的可能性。
    海因里希·劳接着谈到了民主德国国民经济发展的情况。他说，1958年头四个月的工业生产比1957年同期增加了11.2％，这就为超额完成1958年国民经济计划提供了可能性。
    在农业的社会主义改造方面，他提到1958年第一季度新成立了六百七十五个农业生产合作社；新入社的农民有二万七千八百多人。
    海因里希·劳最后谈到反对现代修正主义的问题。他说，正如南共纲领所表明的那样，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在马克思列宁主义最基本的问题上是坚持修正主义立场的。他说，南斯拉夫领导人的修正主义正被帝国主义势力用来毒害国际工人运动。所以，所有马克思列宁主义政党都讲了话。这不仅是为了斥责修正主义观点，而且是为了给以回击。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社柏林14日讯：“新德意志报”14日发表了德国统一社会党中央政治局委员诺伊曼在党的第三十六次中央全会上关于第五次党代表大会筹备工作的报告。
    诺伊曼说，党代表大会的筹备工作已经远远越出了党的范围而成了工人阶级和人民群众的重要事件。他指出，党在劳动人民中间的威望正在日益提高。
    报告人谈到了全国各级党组织在改选领导机构和举行党代表会议中所取得的成果。各级党组织一致拥护中央委员会的政策。
    诺伊曼说，在初级党组织举行会议期间，有三十一万党员被选入了党的基层领导机关。
    报告人详细分析了各级党组织在举行会议和代表会议的过程中所暴露的一些工作缺点。他指出，党在工会中的工作还存在着严重缺点。他警告说，要防止那种对党在群众组织中的工作的意义估计不足的倾向。他号召彻底改进党在这些组织中的工作。（附图片）
