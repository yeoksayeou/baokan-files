    Liberate Thinking, Resolutely Implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction in Scientific Undertakings
　　Zhang Jingfu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    In his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, when discussing the goals of the technological revolution and cultural revolution, put forward a great task for scientific work: "On the basis of fulfilling the 'Twelve-Year Science Development Plan,' catch up with the world's most advanced levels as soon as possible." From recent reports of agricultural tool improvements and many inventions in production and construction across the country, we see that a new revolutionary movement of a national technological and cultural revolution is unfolding on the vast land of the motherland. Faced with such a new revolutionary situation and great struggle task, we are both very excited and deeply feel that the responsibility of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is becoming increasingly important.

    To successfully complete the enormous tasks assigned to the Chinese Academy of Sciences by the Party and the people of the whole country, we believe that the most fundamental guarantee is to resolutely implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific undertakings. The most important issue at present is to further launch a major ideological liberation within the scientific ranks on the basis of the rectification movement over the past year. Only by breaking through the various ideological obstacles and superstitions that hinder the implementation of the general line for socialist construction can the Party's general line for socialist construction truly become a beacon for the advancement of all scientific workers. Only with a great leap forward in ideology can a real great leap forward in scientific undertakings be achieved. What are some of the ideological obstacles and superstitions that hinder the implementation of the general line for socialist construction in the natural science ranks? Judging from the current situation in the various institutes of the Academy of Sciences, the following are some of the main ideological issues that still need to be further resolved in depth.

    (1) To further resolve "promoting the proletarian ideology and eliminating the bourgeois ideology," it is necessary to continue to deeply eliminate the harmful influence of bourgeois ideology on scientific work and firmly establish the socialist direction. After the anti-Rightist struggle, the vast majority of people have clarified the socialist direction in politics, but the bourgeois ideology in scientific work has not been thoroughly resolved by many people. "Taking the socialist road in politics, taking the capitalist road in business," "I listen to you in politics, you listen to me in business," many people have this kind of thinking. We demand that all work must have a clear purpose of serving socialist construction, and on this premise, combine national needs with individual expertise to carry out work in a planned way. However, people with bourgeois individualism as their main purpose take personal fame and gain as their main purpose, or ignore national tasks to pursue unimportant topics that they think can bring fame and profit. Or they play tricks, using the method of "holding an umbrella," the umbrella is the national task, and under the umbrella, they do things that they think are beneficial to themselves; the masses' big-character posters criticize this as "selling dog meat under the guise of a sheep's head." Or they tell lies, exaggerating the importance of unimportant work to fool the "country bumpkins." Or they are worried about gains and losses, "picking fat and abandoning thin" in research topics. Changing this today and that tomorrow, swaying back and forth, they have not carried out work for a long time, let alone results. Some people oppose collective cooperation, emphasize working alone, and even attack and exclude others, forming "internal friction." What is even worse is to "occupy territory," not allowing others to get involved in their "scope," and even keeping good "materials" for themselves, not allowing others to see them. They can criticize others, but they are not allowed to criticize themselves. What is even worse is to steal the fruits of others' labor and claim them as their own; suppress new forces and not allow others to go ahead, and so on. Although these problems have been gradually changing through previous movements and years of ideological education, only in this double-anti movement, when the flood-like mass big-character posters were ignited, did many scientists further realize that it is necessary to break the bourgeois ideology in business and establish socialist ideology, and proposed: "Not only be a leftist in politics, but also be a leftist in business," setting off a wave of "heart-to-heart talks," formulating red and expert plans, and launching an ideological transformation movement that is far more profound than any previous movement. From well-known scientists to every young person, all have undergone a mass fiery trial without exception. The movement is still deepening, the situation has changed greatly, and the outlook has been renewed. However, to completely solve this problem, it is estimated that there will be some repetitions in the future, and long-term hard work will still be needed in the future.

    (2) To break the "academic" viewpoint and establish the mass viewpoint. Scientific undertakings are the common cause of the masses, and without exception, must also follow the mass line, combining experts and the masses, and combining popularization and improvement. To implement the mass line, it is necessary to break some of the erroneous arguments that are quite popular at present. One is to render science too mysterious, making people feel that it is profound and unpredictable. One is the "special theory," believing that other work can follow the mass line, but scientific work cannot. There is also an outdated "specification theory," using old frameworks to look at people, only those who fit the framework can do research work, otherwise they are rejected, making scientific undertakings "out of reach." All of these hinder greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and must be broken. Facts have also proven that it can be broken. Two examples can be given below:

    One thing is the research on "establishing an alloy structural steel system." Originally, this work was only being researched by relevant research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and it was expected that it would only be initially resolved by the end of the second five-year plan. However, because various machine manufacturing plants had to complete production tasks, the failure to solve alloy structural steel became a prominent difficulty. Therefore, relevant departments later held two special meetings to arrange for various plants to do it together. Because it was a matter of their own interests, many plants actively mobilized their technical personnel and skilled workers to think of ways to solve it. After more than a year of efforts, according to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, this year, there are seventy-eight types of substitute nickel-chromium steel; it is estimated that all of them can be solved in another two years, which is two years ahead of the original plan.

    Another thing is soil survey work. In order to solve the problem of soil improvement and rational land use in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, the State Council transferred more than 100 college students, and two senior researchers and four intermediate researchers presided over this work. More than 400 people from various provinces participated in the work. After more than two years in the North China Plain, very good results were obtained. This year, the work was transferred to the Yangtze River basin, and the working methods have been greatly improved, implementing the combination of experts and the masses. The method adopted is: "Divide the work into areas, contract for surveys, summarize the experience of the masses, trace the theoretical basis, organize materials on site, make plans locally, and concentrate on summarizing them upon return." It is expected that this approach will be more greater, faster, better, and more economical than the work in the Yellow River basin. Some people criticized this work a lot in the past, saying that only two senior personnel leading so many young people is simply "nonsense." What was the result? It broke the old rule that a senior person can only lead five or at most ten people, broke the academic corruption, and proved that this approach is good.

    (3) To force ourselves to solve problems independently, establish self-confidence; break the dependency thinking, break the superstition of England and the United States. Practice has proven that things need to be forced, and forcing often leads to results. For example, water gas synthesis of petroleum, forcing ourselves to do it, and the Petroleum Research Institute did it. This work is a new work from scratch in our country. After six years of efforts, the Petroleum Research Institute has initially achieved results that far exceed those of the United States. The United States can synthesize more than 140 grams of petroleum and chemical products from one cubic meter of gas, while our result is more than 190 grams, and the operation is convenient and stable, and it can be widely developed. In the process of carrying out this work, we encountered many difficulties. The most important difficulty was to eliminate the superstition of England and the United States and establish self-confidence. Some people once ridiculed: After World War II, about 20 enterprises in the United States invested a lot of manpower in this research, and it took more than ten years to get unsatisfactory industrial results. A British authority has concluded that it is not easy to solve. Can you do it? The result is that it was done, and the results exceeded those of the United States.

    (4) To attach importance to learning and mastering existing foreign achievements, but also to attach importance to the development of new creations, and especially to attach importance to creative work that combines the natural characteristics of China. At present, there are two incorrect attitudes regarding the relationship between learning and mastering foreign achievements and our own creations. One is that they are not enthusiastic about mastering existing foreign achievements and are not active in learning from the Soviet Union. They have not deeply realized that quickly mastering the existing achievements of others can enable us to develop faster and have new creations. Advancing on the basis of the achievements of others is the closest path to catching up with the world's advanced levels. Many countries that have come from behind have mostly adopted this method. The other attitude is to emphasize learning and mastering, but not dare to mention creation. They do not dare to do what others have not done, and they have a serious sense of inferiority. Practice has proven that we not only have creations in the process of learning and mastering, but also can develop and have new creations. In natural science, there are two types of creative work with world-class levels. One type is creative work with common characteristics in various countries, such as some basic theoretical work in mathematics and atomic physics. The other type is creative work obtained in connection with the specific characteristics of various countries. Our country has particularly good conditions for this type of work. For example, the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River, the extraction and utilization of rare earth elements, and the production of organic synthetic raw materials according to the characteristics of our country's resources, will produce significant creative results. In the past two years, the Geological Research Institute's investigation and research in the Qilian Mountains have opened up 14 geological survey routes in a large area of 1,000 kilometers from east to west and 500 kilometers from north to south, and conducted 12 special studies, initially clarifying the geological structure and mineral distribution laws in the Qilian Mountains. They also put forward the heroic aspiration to further conquer the Kunlun Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau. And this type of alpine region is a unique geological area in the world. If such work can further achieve results, it will not only support national construction, but also be a world-class work in geological science research. As for some unique achievements left by our ancestors, such as the rich experience of traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, agriculture, and handicrafts production, if they can be summarized and raised to become scientific theories, wouldn't they be creative work with world-class levels? In addition, some disciplines in which our country originally had a certain foundation, and some work has already shown signs, have the possibility of producing creative research results in a relatively short period of time.

    (5) To boldly use young people and break the conservative thinking of not letting go of young people. We must give full play to the role of old scientists, which is certain. But there are too few of them, far from meeting the needs. To open up many new scientific fields, we must rely more on the growth of new forces. As long as we overcome conservative thinking and boldly use young people, new forces will grow very quickly. One example is the theoretical research work on the structure of atomic nuclei at the Institute of Physics. At the beginning, there was a lack of personnel, and two plans were considered: Should the old scientists cultivate young people in their familiar areas, and then have the young people change careers to open up this new field? Or should the young people be allowed to directly break ground in this field with the encouragement of the old scientists? In the end, the approach was to let the young people break ground directly. At that time, many people doubted it; now it has been proven that the road was opened up by the young people, and the results are very good. Another example is the young people at the Institute of Geophysics. The electronic amplification seismograph they developed is better and more economical than the old ones. This work was done "underground" because the mentor did not support it.

    Recently, on the basis of the great leap forward in ideology, the research units of the Academy of Sciences have set off a new upsurge of the great leap forward in work. From the young to the old, they have shown vigorous vitality. Not only can more tasks be done, but also the progress is greatly accelerated; they enthusiastically support the technical reforms of the masses, learn from the masses, raise the experience of the masses to the scientific level, and popularize science to the masses; at the same time, some problems that they did not dare to think, mention, or do in the past, they now dare to think, mention, and do. I will now give some examples of the great leaps forward resolutions and major initiatives that scientists have excitedly put forward at the leap forward meetings recently held by the research units in the Beijing area of the Academy of Sciences. For example, the Institute of Chemistry and the Institute of Mechanics proposed to cooperate in researching the application of new fluid mechanics methods to chemical reactions. The application of this method can enhance the activity of the reactants, so that the chemical reaction can be carried out in a few thousandths of a second, and due to the effect of shock waves, the reactants can be raised from low temperature to high temperature in an instant, and then quickly reduced to low temperature, and the process of the reaction can be effectively controlled without any catalyst. If this work is successful, it will bring about a major innovation in the chemical industry. The original plan of the small blast furnace research project of the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy was to be completed in five years, but now it will be completed in three years, two years ahead of schedule. The Institute of Geophysics proposed to study the problem of artificial rainfall and regulating the melting of glaciers and snow in high mountain areas to solve the drought in the Northwest and change the climate in the Northwest. The Institute of Applied Mycology proposed that effective measures should be studied within three years to basically eliminate several severely harmful diseases that have not been solved for decades, such as rice blast, wheat rust, cotton wilt and wilt disease, potato degeneration disease and late blight. The Institute of Entomology proposed that measures should be taken within three years to basically eliminate rice borers and other insect pests. Compiling the National Flora is a very heavy task. Some botanists originally estimated that it would take five or six decades to compile it, but now it is proposed to basically complete it within ten years. The above examples are only a small part of the materials introduced by a few units. Although some initiatives and resolutions are only put forward as plans, the spirit is good, and some of them are things that they did not dare to think, mention, or do in the past, but now they dare to think, mention, and do. After mass discussion, they were extremely excited, thinking that this is the thought of going upstream, this is going all out.

    From this, it can be seen how profound the significance of Chairman Mao's instruction that we should liberate our minds and break superstitions is. We believe that as long as the Party strengthens its leadership over scientific undertakings and resolutely implements the Party's general line for socialist construction in scientific undertakings, and goes all out, instead of only going all out to 70% or 80%; and strives for upstream, instead of midstream; we are fully confident and have the possibility to make our country's scientific undertakings catch up with the world's advanced levels as soon as possible.

    解放思想，在科学事业中坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线
　　中国科学院副院长　张劲夫
    刘少奇同志代表党中央向八大二次会议的报告中，在讲到技术革命和文化革命的目标时，对科学工作提出了“在实现‘十二年科学发展规划’的基础上，尽快地赶上世界上最先进的水平”这样一个伟大的任务。从最近各地改良农具和许多生产建设方面创造发明的报道中，我们看到，一个全民性的技术革命和文化革命的波澜壮阔的新的革命运动，正在祖国广大的土地上开展起来。面对着这样一个新的革命形势和伟大的斗争任务，我们一方面非常兴奋，一方面深感科学院的责任日益重大。
    要胜利地完成党和全国人民所交给中国科学院的巨大任务，我们认为，最根本的保证，是要在科学事业中坚决地贯彻党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线，而当前最首要的问题，是在一年来整风运动的基础上，进一步在科学队伍中来一个思想大解放，只有把妨害社会主义建设总路线贯彻的种种思想障碍和迷信冲破了，才能使党的社会主义建设总路线，真正成为全体科学工作人员前进的灯塔。只有在思想上有了大跃进，才能够实现科学事业上真正的大跃进。在自然科学队伍中有哪一些妨害社会主义建设总路线贯彻的思想障碍和迷信呢？从目前科学院各研究所的情况来看，有以下一些主要思想问题还需要进一步深入解决。
    （一）进一步解决“兴无灭资”，要继续深入清除资产阶级思想给予科学业务的危害影响，巩固地确立社会主义的方向。经过反右派斗争以后，在政治上绝大多数人是明确了社会主义的方向，但在科学业务上的资产阶级思想，许多人并未得到彻底解决。“政治上走社会主义道路，业务上走资本主义道路”，“政治上我听你的，业务上你听我的”，有这种思想的人相当不少。我们要求不管什么工作，都要有为社会主义建设服务的明确目的性，在此前提下把国家需要和个人专长结合起来，有计划地开展工作。但是具有资产阶级个人主义思想的人，却以个人名利为主要的目的，或者不顾国家任务，去追求个人认为能够出名得利的无关紧要的题目。或者玩弄手段，用“撑一把伞”的办法，伞是国家任务，伞下边做自己认为有利的事；群众大字报批评说这是“挂羊头，卖狗肉”。或者说假话，把不重要的工作，硬说成很重要的工作，来哄“土包子”。或者是患得患失，对研究题目“拣肥弃瘦”。今天换这，明天换那，摇摇晃晃，许久未开展工作，更谈不到结果。有些人反对集体协作，强调单干，甚至打击排斥别人，形成“内耗”。更不好的是要“霸占地盘”，他的“范围”不允许别人插脚，甚至把好的“资料”据为己有，不允许别人看。自己可以批评别人，但不许别人批评自己。更坏的是窃取别人劳动果实，据为己有；压制新生力量，不许别人走在前边等等。这些问题，经过历次运动和几年来的思想教育，虽然是在逐步改变的过程中，但只有到了这次双反运动，山洪暴发式的群众大字报烧起来了，许多科学家才进一步觉悟起来，认识到要破业务上的资产阶级思想，立社会主义思想，提出：“不仅要做政治上的左派，并要做业务上的左派”，掀起了“交心”热潮，订立红专规划，开展了比以往历次运动都远为深刻的思想改造运动。从知名科学家到每一个青年，都毫无例外地经受一次群众烈火的锻炼，现在运动还在深入，形势已经大变，面貌为之一新。但要彻底解决这一问题，估计今后还会有些反复，还需要经过今后长期的艰苦工作。
    （二）要打破“学院式”的观点，树立群众观点。科学事业是群众共同的事业，毫无例外地也要走群众路线，使专家和群众结合起来，使普及和提高结合起来。要贯彻群众路线，就要打破目前相当流行的一些错误论调。一种是把科学渲染得过于神秘化，使人感到高深莫测。一种是“特殊论”，认为别的工作可以走群众路线，科学工作不能走群众路线。还有一种是陈旧的“规格论”，以旧的框子看人，合了框子才可做研究工作，否则拒之门外，把科学事业搞得“高不可攀”。所有这些，都妨碍多快好省，一定要打破。事实证明也是可以打破的。下边可举两个例子：
    一件事是“建立合金结构钢系统”的研究。原来这一工作只是中国科学院和冶金工业部的有关研究单位在研究，预计到第二个五年计划末才能初步解决。但各机器制造厂因要完成生产任务，合金结构钢不能解决就成为突出困难，因此后来就由有关部门开了两次专门会议布置各厂一起来做。许多厂因为是切身问题，就积极动员自己的技术人员和技术工人，大家来想办法解决。经过一年多的努力，据冶金工业部统计，今年代用镍铬钢种可达七十八种；估计再有两年即可全部解决，比原订计划可以提前两年完成。
    再一件事是土壤调查工作。为了解决黄河、长江流域土壤改良和土地合理利用问题，国务院调了一百多大学生，由两位高级研究人员和四位中级研究人员主持了这项工作，前后各省来参加工作的有四百多人。在华北平原经过二年多时间，获得了很好的结果。今年转到长江流域工作，工作方法大有改进，实行专家和群众相结合。采取：“分片包干调查，总结群众经验，追索理论依据，现场整理资料，当地作好规划，回来集中汇总”的方法。预计这样的做法，将会比黄河流域工作更为多快好省。有些人过去对这件工作批评很多，说只有两个高级人员带这么多青年，简直是“胡闹”。结果怎样呢，打破了一个高级人员只能带五个人至多十个人的陈规，打破了学院式的腐臭气，证明这样的做法是好的。
    （三）要逼着自己独立解决问题，树立自信心；打破依赖思想，打破对英美的迷信。实践证明，事情要逼，一逼往往能出货。例如水煤气合成石油，逼着自己搞，石油研究所也就搞出来了。这项工作在我国是从无到有的一项新工作。石油研究所经过六年来的努力，初步得到的结果，是远远超过了美国。美国一立方公尺的煤气，可合成石油和化学产品一百四十多克，我们的结果是一百九十多克，而且操作方便稳定，可以遍地开花。在进行这项工作中，曾经遇到了许多难关，最重要的一关是破除对英美的迷信，树立自信心。有的人曾经讽刺：美国人在二次大战后，约有二十多个企业投入大量人力从事这项研究，花了十多年时间才得出并不理想的工业结果。英国一位权威已做结论说不易解决。你们能做成吗？结果是做成了，成果超过美国。
    （四）既要重视学习掌握国外现有的成就，又要重视发展新的创造，特别要重视结合中国自然特点的创造性工作。目前在学习掌握国外成果和自己创造的关系上，有两种态度是不正确的。一种是对掌握现有国外成就不热心，向苏联学习不积极。没有深刻认识到迅速掌握别人现有的成果，可以使我们更快地发展，有新的创造。在别人已取得成就的基础上前进，这是追赶世界先进水平最近的道路。许多国家后来居上，大都是采取了这种办法。另一种态度是强调学习掌握，而不敢提创造，别人未做过的就不敢做，有严重的自卑感。实践证明，我们不仅在学习掌握的过程中就有创造，而且能够发展，有新的创造。在自然科学上具有世界水平的创造性工作，有一类是世界各国带有共同性的创造性工作，像数学、原子物理学等的一些基础理论性工作。有一类是联系各国具体特点而得到的创造性工作，这类工作在我们中国条件特别好。比如长江三峡枢纽工程，稀土元素的提取和利用，按照我国资源特点采取和国外不同途径来制取有机合成原料等，都会产生重大创造性的成果。地质研究所两年来对祁连山区的考察研究，在东西一千公里、南北五百公里的大面积上，开辟了十四条地质测量路线，进行了十二个专题研究，初步地把祁连山区地质构造和矿产分布规律搞清楚了。他们并提出豪迈的志愿，要进一步去征服昆仑山区和西藏高原。而这类高山地区是世界上特有的地质区域，像这样的工作如能进一步得到成果，就不仅是支持了国家建设，同时也就是在地质科学研究上具有世界水平的工作。至于我们祖先遗留下来的一些独特成就，像中医、中药和农业、手工业生产的丰富经验，如能总结提高到成为科学理论，难道不是具有世界水平的创造性工作吗？此外，原来我国有一定基础的学科，有些工作，已露苗头，更有着在较短的时间内产生创造性研究成果的可能。
    （五）要大胆放手使用青年，打破对青年不放手的保守思想。我们要充分发挥老科学家的作用，这是肯定的。但他们为数太少，远远不能适应需要。要开辟许多新的科学领域必须更多地要依靠新生力量的生长。只要我们克服保守思想，大胆放手使用青年，新生力量生长是很快的。一个例子是物理研究所原子核结构的理论研究工作，开始是缺门，曾考虑两个方案：由老科学家在他自己熟悉的范围，培养出青年，再由青年来转业去开辟这一新领域呢？还是在老科学家鼓励下，放手让青年人直接就在这领域来闯开局面。最后采取让青年人直接闯。当时有许多人怀疑；现在证明，路是被青年人闯开了，而且结果很好。再一个例子是地球物理研究所的青年人员，他们研究制成的电子放大式地震仪，比老式的又好又节省。这件工作因导师不支持，是在“地下”做出来的。
    最近科学院各研究单位在思想大跃进的基础上，掀起了工作大跃进的新高潮，从年青的到年老的，都表现了蓬勃的活力。不仅任务可以做的更多，而且进度大大加快；热心支持群众的技术改革，向群众学习，把群众的经验提高到科学水平上来，把科学普及到群众中去；同时有些过去不敢想不敢提不敢做的问题，也敢想也敢提也敢做了。我现在举一些最近在科学院北京地区各研究单位召开的跃进会议上，科学家们都兴奋地提出跃进决心和重大的创议。例如：化学研究所和力学研究所提出，要合作研究把新的流体力学的方法应用到化学反应中来。应用了这种方法，可以加强反应物的活性，使化学反应能够在几千分之一秒的时间内进行，并且由于冲激波的作用，可以把反应物在一刹那间从低温升到高温，然后又迅速降为低温，不需要任何催化剂即可有效地控制反应的进程。这件工作如获成功，就会使化学工业发生重大的革新。化工冶金研究所的小高炉研究计划原定五年完成，现在要提前二年，在三年内完成。地球物理研究所提出要研究人工降雨、调节高山区冰川积雪的溶化的问题，来解决西北干旱和改变西北地区气候。应用真菌学研究所提出，对于几十年来没有解决的稻瘟、麦锈、棉花黄萎病和枯萎病、马铃薯退化病和晚疫病等几种为害严重的病害，三年内要研究出有效措施，基本上消灭这些病害。昆虫研究所提出，三年内要解决基本上消灭稻螟和其他虫害的措施。编写全国植物志是件很繁重的工作，原来有些植物学家估计要五、六十年时间才能编写好，现在提出要在十年内基本上完成。上述这些例子，仅是介绍了少数单位的一小部分材料。有些创议和决心，尽管只是作为计划提出，但精神是好的，而且有些是过去不敢想不敢提不敢做的事，现在敢想敢提敢做了。经过群众讨论，异常兴奋，认为这才是上游的思想，这才是鼓足了干劲。
    由此可见，毛主席指示我们要解放思想，打破迷信，该具有多么深刻的意义。我们认为，只要党加强对科学事业的领导，坚决地把党的社会主义建设总路线贯彻到科学事业中去，鼓足干劲，而不是只鼓起七、八成劲；力争上游，而不是中游；我们完全有信心有可能使我国科学事业尽快地赶上世界先进水平。
