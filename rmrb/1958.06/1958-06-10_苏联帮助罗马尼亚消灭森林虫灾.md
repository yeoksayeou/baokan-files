Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 9th: Recently, forest pest infestations occurred in areas of Romania, including Paul Sec, Topritzio, and Torchesti. Romania received assistance from the Soviet Union in eliminating the pest infestations.

The Soviet Union supplied Romania with a batch of aircraft capable of spraying insecticide powder from the air. Currently, Romania has used these aircraft to eliminate pest infestations in 15,000 hectares of forest. An average of over 15,000 insect eggs were killed on each fir tree.

Romania has abundant forest resources, with forests accounting for 25.8% of the country's total area. The aforementioned regions of Romania experienced pest infestations last year. Last winter, Romanian experts, along with experts from the Soviet Union, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia, jointly studied and formulated a plan to eliminate forest pests. The Soviet Union's assistance to Romania in eliminating forest pests this year is being carried out according to this plan.

    苏联帮助罗马尼亚消灭森林虫灾
    据新华社布加勒斯特9日电最近，罗马尼亚的保尔塞克、托普里椒、托尔契什蒂等地的森林发生了虫灾。在消灭虫灾的时候，罗马尼亚得到了苏联的帮助。
    苏联供给了罗马尼亚一批能在空中喷撒灭虫药粉的飞机。目前，罗马尼亚已经用这些飞机消灭了一万五千公顷森林中的虫灾。在每株枞树上杀死的虫卵平均达一万五千个以上。
    罗马尼亚的森林资源丰富，森林面积占全国总面积的25.8％。去年，罗马尼亚的上述地区就曾经发生过虫灾。去年冬季，罗马尼亚的专家和苏联、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克的专家一起，共同研究和制定了消灭森林虫灾的计划。今年苏联帮助罗马尼亚消灭森林虫灾就是根据这个计划进行的。
