The scientific workers of the Semiconductor Laboratory of the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have greatly improved their ideological awareness after the Rectification Campaign. At present, many research projects in their leap forward plan have been completed ahead of schedule, and some of them have caught up with international standards.

The "65 MHz Semiconductor Transistor" has been successfully developed. This is a type of tube used in telecommunications equipment and national defense to replace vacuum tubes. The original plan was to complete this research by the end of 1958, with a frequency of 20 MHz. Now, it has not only been completed half a year ahead of schedule, but the frequency is also 65 MHz.

The "High-Frequency Power Transistor" has been successfully developed. This is also a type of tube used in telecommunications equipment and national defense to replace vacuum tubes. The original plan was to complete this research in 1959.

"N-type" and "P-type" germanium single crystals have been successfully developed. This is a type of crystal needed for high-frequency and medium-frequency semiconductor transistors in the telecommunications industry. At present, the lifespan of the minority "mobile electrons" of these two types of germanium single crystals internationally is generally "100 microseconds" (i.e., one-thousandth of a second). The highest value of the germanium single crystals made in China is 300 microseconds, and the lowest is above 100 microseconds. Therefore, it has exceeded international standards.

"Low-Dislocation Density Germanium Single Crystal" has been successfully developed. This is a crystal that is essential for certain semiconductor transistors used in national defense. The current international level for this type of germanium single crystal is 100 to 1000 dislocations per square centimeter. The one developed in China has 300 dislocations, so it has also reached international standards.

"Germanium Grown Junction Single Crystal" has been successfully developed. This is a crystal needed to manufacture general high-frequency semiconductor transistors.

"Photosensitive Diode Semiconductor Transistor" has been successfully developed. This is an essential component for electronic computers. This research was completed by a young intern researcher and a young trainee.

The scientific workers of the Semiconductor Laboratory have also successfully researched and developed a method for measuring short lifespans using steady-state photoconductivity comparison, which is used to measure the electronic activity of germanium. In addition, they have also researched and developed two instruments: the "Maximum Oscillation Frequency Tester" and the "Busy Tone Generator."

These research achievements have laid the foundation for China's semiconductor science and have also created conditions for the application of semiconductors in industry and national defense in our country.

The scientific workers of the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, using leap forward actions, broke through the leap forward plan and successfully made sparkling rubies on the night of the 14th.

Artificial ruby is a necessary hard crystal for clock bearings, bearings for many precision instruments, and as a lead wire in the man-made fiber industry. Its hardness is second only to diamond. Therefore, it is indispensable in industry and national defense.

Before the Rectification Campaign, some scientific workers believed that China simply did not have the conditions to make rubies. Therefore, they were unwilling to consider making rubies because making it would not produce any papers. After this kind of thinking was criticized, they were determined to make rubies. The initial plan was to send people to study abroad and planned to make it by October 1, 1959. Later, they felt that this was too slow, so they wanted to obtain information from abroad without going abroad to study, striving to make it by May 1, 1959. Later, after "seeking truth," they took another leap forward and decided not to ask for information anymore, but to do it themselves, deciding to make it by October 1 this year. After the promotion of the workers in the Institute's affiliated factory, it was decided to make rubies by July 1. From June 3rd to 5th, the Beijing area research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a leap forward conference. The factory comrades rushed to make a gift for the conference, and the furnace was made on June 5th. The scientific workers of the Crystallography Group of the Institute of Applied Physics, who were responsible for this work, were therefore encouraged to work even harder and made rubies for our country at twelve o'clock late at night on June 14.

The scientific workers of the Crystallography Group told reporters that they were able to realize the leap forward plan so early mainly because of: the support and care of the Party organization in the institute; the cooperation of all relevant comrades in the institute; and when encountering difficulties, everyone held "Zhuge Liang meetings" to solve problems.

    应用物理研究所突破跃进计划
    完成半导体的许多研究项目
    人造红宝石已经提前制造成功
    本报讯　中国科学院应用物理研究所半导体室的科学工作者们，经过整风运动，思想觉悟大大提高。目前，他们的跃进计划中的许多研究项目已经提前完成，其中有的研究项目已经赶上国际水平。
    “六十五兆周半导体晶体管”制成功了。这是电讯设备上和国防上用以代替真空管的一种管子；这项研究原计划在1958年底完成，频率是二十兆周，现在不仅提前半年完成，而且频率是六十五兆周。
    “高频功率晶体管”制成功了。这也是电讯设备上和国防上用以代替真空管的一种管子。这项研究原计划在1959年完成。
    “N型”和“P型”的锗单晶制成功了。这是电讯工业上高频率的和中频率的半导体晶体管需要的一种晶体。目前国际上这两种锗单晶的少数“可移电子”的寿命一般是“一百微秒”（即千分之一秒），我国做出的锗单晶，最高是三百微秒，最低的也在一百微秒以上，因此，已经超过国际水平。
    “低位错密度锗单晶”制成功了。这是国防上某种半导体晶体管必用的晶体。目前国际上的水平，这种锗单晶每一平方厘米是100到1000个位错，我国制成的是300个位错，所以也已经达到国际水平。
     锗生长结单晶体”制成功了。这是制造一般的高频率半导体晶体管需要的晶体。
    “光敏二极半导体晶体管”制成功了。这是电子计算机上必用的构件。这项研究是一个年轻的实习研究员和一个年轻的见习员负责完成的。
    半导体室的科学工作者们还研究成功了用定态光电导比较法测短寿命，这是用来测锗的电子活动用的。此外，他们还研究制成了“最高振荡频率测试仪”和“忙音发生器”两种仪器。
    这些研究成果，为我国半导体科学事业打下了基础，也为我国在工业上和国防上应用半导体创造了条件。
    本报讯　中国科学院应用物理研究所的科学工作者们，用跃进的行动突破了跃进的计划，在14日夜做成功了闪闪发光的红宝石。
    人造红宝石，它是钟表轴承、许多精密仪器轴承以及在人造纤维工业上用作引线的一种必需的硬质晶体；它的硬度仅次于金刚石。所以它是工业上和国防上都不可缺少的东西。
    整风运动以前，有的科学工作者，认为中国根本没有条件做红宝石。因此，也不愿考虑做红宝石，因为做它不能出什么论文。这种思想经过批判后，他们决心做红宝石了。首先计划派人到外国去学，打算1959年10月1日做出来。后来觉得这样太慢，又想不去留学而去外国要资料，争取1959年5月1日做出来。后来他们经过“务虚”，又跃进一步，决定不去要资料了，自己想法干，决定今年10月1日做出来。经过研究所附属工厂工人们的促进，又决定7月1日做出红宝石。6月3日到5日中国科学院北京区研究单位开跃进大会，工厂同志赶着为大会献礼，6月5日就做出了炉子。负责这项工作的应用物理研究所晶体学组的科学工作者们，因而鼓起了更大的干劲，在6月14日深夜十二时，为我国做出了红宝石。
    晶体学组的科学工作者对记者说，他们能这样提前实现跃进计划，主要是：研究所里党组织的支持和关怀；全所有关同志的协作；遇到困难时，大家就开“诸葛亮会”解决问题。（附图片）
