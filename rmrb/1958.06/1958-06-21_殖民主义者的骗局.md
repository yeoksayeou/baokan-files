    The Colonialists' Deception
    By the People's Daily Commentator
    On June 19th, the British government announced a "new plan" for resolving the Cyprus issue. The main content of this "new plan" is: Cyprus's international status will remain unchanged for seven years; the residents of Greek descent and Turkish descent on the island can enjoy autonomy in ethnic affairs; while defense, diplomacy, and internal security will still be solely controlled by the British Governor.
    The British government says it wants to use this "new plan" to solve the Cyprus issue, but this is clearly a non-workable deception. This is because what the people of Cyprus urgently demand is the right to self-determination. Now, the British "new plan" is merely playing with the so-called "autonomy" trick that the people of Cyprus have repeatedly rejected in the past, while leaving the issue of self-determination aside. This is, of course, unacceptable to the people of Cyprus. Archbishop Makarios, the Cypriot national leader, has clearly replied to the British government that the people of Cyprus oppose this so-called "new plan" that violates their will. For the same reason, the Greek government has also declared its rejection of this "new plan."
    The Turkish government also opposes the British "new plan." However, this is a different situation. The Turkish government advocates "partition" in Cyprus. This proposition is fundamentally unachievable. On the island of Cyprus, there are about 400,000 residents of Greek descent and only about 80,000 residents of Turkish descent; and these two ethnic groups live scattered and intermingled throughout the island. If "partition" is implemented, it would mean a large-scale relocation of hundreds of thousands of families, plunging the island into chaos and planting the seeds of long-term discord between the two ethnic groups. It is worth noting that this "partition" proposal was originally put forward by the British, and only later picked up by the Turkish government. The British government is using this unreasonable attitude of the Turkish government to obstruct the resolution of the Cyprus issue, in order to use the island as a military base to suppress the national liberation movement and to maintain British colonial interests in the Mediterranean coastal region.
    This point can be seen very clearly at present. Starting in early June, under the instigation of the British authorities, Turkish-blooded thugs in Cyprus continuously attacked Greek-blooded residents, causing large-scale bloodshed. After this, Britain has been constantly sending troops to Cyprus, increasing the garrison on the island to more than 30,000. According to the British government, the purpose of increasing troops is merely to "maintain order" in Cyprus. However, according to Reuters, the real purpose of the British government is "to have troops that can be quickly sent to Lebanon."
    The people of Cyprus will never allow their land to be used by British colonialists as a military base for suppressing national independence movements. They will use more resolute struggles to fight for their independence. Moreover, if Britain pursues an adventurous policy and carries out military intervention in Lebanon, it will certainly not end well. Labor MP Stansgate raised the "experience on the Suez issue" when speaking in the House of Lords, which is indeed worth considering by the Macmillan government.
    The British government's use of the "new plan" deception to delay the resolution of the Cyprus issue will not only further intensify the struggle between the people of Cyprus and the British colonialists, but will also further deepen the contradictions within the North Atlantic Group. Recently, the Permanent Representatives Council of the North Atlantic Group held an emergency meeting under the direction of the United States, attempting to ease the quarrel between Britain, Turkey, and Greece in order to avoid weakening the military bloc, but the result was unsuccessful. Of course, another purpose of the United States in taking this action is to attempt to use the current situation in Cyprus to "North Atlanticize" the island, that is, to place it under the control of the United States in order to expand its colonial power in the Mediterranean region. This is bound to sharpen the contradictions between the United States and Britain, and arouse stronger anti-American sentiment among the Greek people.
    The Cypriot people's demand for self-determination cannot be stopped. They will surely shatter the shackles of colonialism and move towards the road of national independence. The British colonialists' "new plan" deception, as well as the American colonialists' double-dealing tactics, will not succeed in the face of their struggle.

    殖民主义者的骗局
    本报评论员
    6月19日，英国政府宣布了解决塞浦路斯问题的“新计划”。这个“新计划”的主要内容是：七年内塞浦路斯的国际地位保持不变，岛上的希腊血统居民和土耳其血统居民在民族事务上可以享有自治权，而防务、外交和内部安全仍然由英国总督独揽大权。
    英国政府说要用这个“新计划”来解决塞浦路斯问题，但这显然是一个行不通的骗局。因为，塞浦路斯人民所迫切要求是自决的权利。现在，英国的“新计划”只是玩弄过去已经早被塞浦路斯人民一再拒绝的所谓“自治”的花招，而对自决问题撇开不谈，这当然是塞浦路斯人民所不能接受的。塞浦路斯民族领袖马卡里奥斯大主教已经明确地答复英国政府，塞浦路斯人民反对这个违反他们意志的所谓“新计划”。由于同样的理由，希腊政府也已经声明拒绝这个“新计划”。
    土耳其政府也反对英国的“新计划”。但是，这却是另外一种情况了。土耳其政府主张在塞浦路斯实行“分治”。这种主张是根本无法实现的。在塞浦路斯岛上，有四十万左右希腊血统的居民，土耳其血统的居民只有八万左右；而这两种血统的居民又是在岛上各地分散杂居的。假如实行“分治”，就意味着要成千上万个家庭进行一次大搬家，使这个岛屿陷入混乱状态，并且埋下使两种血统的居民长期不和的种子。值得注意的是，这种“分治”的主张原来是英国提出的，以后才被土耳其政府拣起来了。英国政府就利用土耳其政府的这种无理态度，来阻挠塞浦路斯问题的解决，以便把这个岛屿作为镇压民族解放运动的一个军事基地，来维护英国在地中海沿岸地区的殖民利益。
    这一点，在目前可以看得十分清楚。从6月上旬开始，在英国当局的怂恿下，塞浦路斯的土耳其血统的暴徒连续对希腊血统的居民进行袭击，造成了大规模的流血事件。在这以后，英国就不断向塞浦路斯派遣军队，使这个岛屿的驻军增加到三万名以上。据英国政府说，增兵的目的仅仅是为了在塞浦路斯“维持秩序”。然而，据路透社透露，英国政府的真正目的是“要有军队可以迅速开往黎巴嫩”。
    塞浦路斯人民决不允许他们的土地被英国殖民主义者利用来作为镇压民族独立运动的军事据点。他们将用更坚决的斗争来争取自己的独立。而且，如果英国执行冒险政策，对黎巴嫩进行军事干涉，肯定也是得不到好结果的。工党议员斯坦斯盖特在上院发言时提出了“在苏伊士问题上的经验”，这的确是值得麦克米伦政府好好考虑的。
    英国政府用“新计划”的骗局来拖延塞浦路斯问题的解决，不但将使塞浦路斯人民和英国殖民主义者之间的斗争进一步加剧，也将使北大西洋集团内部的矛盾进一步加深。最近北大西洋集团常任代表理事会在美国指使下举行紧急会议，企图缓和在英国、土耳其和希腊三国之间的争吵，以免削弱这个军事集团，结果并没有成功。当然，美国采取这个行动的另一个目的还在于企图利用目前塞浦路斯的局势，把这个岛屿“北大西洋化”，也就是放在美国的控制下，以便扩大它在地中海区域的殖民势力。这势必使美英矛盾尖锐化，并且激起希腊人民更强烈的反美情绪。
    塞浦路斯人民的自决要求是不能遏止的。他们一定要粉碎殖民主义的枷锁而走向民族独立的道路。英国殖民主义者“新计划”的骗局也好，美国殖民主义者的两面手法也好，在他们的斗争面前都是不能得逞的。
