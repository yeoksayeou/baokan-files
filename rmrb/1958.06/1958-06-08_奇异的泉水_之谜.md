　　The Mystery of the "Strange Spring Water"
　　Xie Chaofan
    On May 14th, the People's Daily, on its second page, published information about the Wuni'er Mountain spring water on the Hulunbuir grassland of Inner Mongolia. This water has a strange odor and can emit a gas; people drink it and it can even cure diseases, seeming very mysterious.
    From what we understand, there are many other kinds of "strange spring water" near Wuni'er Mountain. We call this kind of water "mineral water," and the spring that produces this water is called a "mineral spring."
    We call the water on the ground "surface water" or "above-ground water," such as river water and lake water; the water underground is called "groundwater," such as well water. Surface water is constantly flowing day and night, and groundwater is also constantly flowing. If we put salt in water, we can't see the salt particles after a while. The previously salt-free water becomes salty water containing salt. Similarly, water can dissolve other salts and minerals to a greater or lesser extent over time. Therefore, when groundwater flows underground (in rock fissures and pores), it gradually contains various minerals. Generally speaking, the minerals contained in groundwater are closely related to the rocks it flows through.
    It is now known that groundwater contains more than seventy different kinds of chemical elements. However, the types and amounts of elements contained in different waters are not the same.
    There is a type of groundwater that contains elements rarely found in ordinary groundwater, such as iodine, boron, fluorine, and radioactive elements. When this water emerges from the ground, many small bubbles often constantly rise, and the water is often warm or hot. This is a "hot spring," "warm spring," or "thermal spring." Because this groundwater has a special chemical composition and gas composition, and its temperature is relatively high, it can be used to treat certain diseases, so people call them "mineral water" or "medicinal mineral water."
    The source of the gaseous components in mineral water may be the rocks near the mineral spring, generated by chemical reactions due to external influences, or it may be due to air dissolving into the groundwater. When spring water flows out of the ground, it indicates that the pressure on the surface is less than the pressure it was subjected to underground. Therefore, the dissolved gas also rises with the upwelling mineral water, which is the bubbles we see.
    Miners know that the deeper the mine, the hotter the bottom of the mine (sometimes this feeling is not significant due to ventilation equipment). This is because the temperature generally increases by one degree Celsius for every thirty-three meters (ninety-nine Chinese feet) of depth below the surface. Therefore, spring water deeply hidden underground is often hot. If this groundwater flows along rock fissures to the surface, it becomes a "hot spring." Groundwater near volcanoes is also usually hot.
    Mineral water can cure diseases because certain elements contained in mineral water, such as boron, have a bactericidal effect, or the biochemical effect of certain chemical elements in the water on substances in the human body, as well as the various reactions caused by the water temperature and dissolved gases on the human body. Our ancestors knew about the therapeutic effect of mineral water long ago, and many mineral springs in our country have long been used for medical treatment.
    When we understand the above principles, we will know that the "Wuni'er Mountain" spring water is not some magical water. Their secrets, like all phenomena in nature, are constantly being recognized and utilized by people. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than seven hundred known mineral springs in our country, which are our country's valuable natural resources. In the Soviet Union and other countries, the use of underground springs is currently not limited to medical treatment; they also use their high temperature and steam pressure to generate electricity, heat, and extract chemical industrial raw materials. Our country is also currently studying the gradual expansion of their utilization. If any so-called "strange spring water" is discovered in various places, it should be reported to the local government in a timely manner and protected.

　　“奇异的泉水”之谜
　　谢超凡
    5月14日人民日报第二版上，刊登了内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上乌尼阿尔山泉水，有一股奇怪的气味，能够散发出一种气体，人们喝了它，还能够治病等，似乎很神秘。
    据我们了解，乌尼阿尔山附近还有很多其他各种“奇异的泉水”。这种水我们称为“矿水”；涌出这种水的泉，称为“矿泉”。
    我们把地面上的水叫“地面水”或“地表水”，如河水、湖水等；地面下的水叫“地下水”如井水等。地表水在日夜不停地流动，地下水也在不停地流动。我们把盐放在水里，隔了一会儿就看不见盐粒了。而原先不含盐的水变成了含盐的咸水。同样，水对其他的盐类和矿物质来说，时间长了都能或多或少地溶解它们。因此，地下水在地下（岩石的裂缝和孔隙）流动时，也就逐渐地含有了各种不同的矿物质。一般说来，地下水中所含的矿物质与它们所流经的岩石是密切相关的。
    目前已经知道，地下水中含有七十种以上不同性质的化学元素。但各种水所含的元素种类和量的多少是不相同的。
    有一种地下水，含有普通地下水中少有的元素：如碘、硼、氟和放射性元素等。这种水在涌出地表时，往往有很多小汽泡不断地冒上来，同时，水还常常是温的或热的，这就是“汤泉”、“暖泉”或“温泉”。由于这种地下水具有特殊的化学成份和气体成份，温度又较高，所以可以用来治疗某些疾病，人们就把它们叫作“矿水”或“医疗矿水”。
    矿水中气体成份的来源，可能是矿泉附近的岩石，由于外界的影响而发生的化学反应所生成的，或者可能是空气溶解到地下水中的缘故。泉水流出地表，就表明地表的压力比它们在地下所受的压力小，所以，溶解的气体也随着上涌的矿水冒上来，这就是我们见到的汽泡。
    矿工们都知道：矿井越深，井底越热（有时因有通风设备，这种感觉不显著）。这是因为一般地表下每增加三十三公尺深（九十九市尺），温度就增高摄氏一度。所以，深藏在地下的泉水，往往是热的。如果这地下水沿着岩石的裂缝跑到地面上来时，就成了“温泉”。通常在火山附近的地下水，也是热的。
    矿水能治病，就是因为矿水里所含的某些元素如硼等有杀菌作用，或是水中某些化学元素对人身上的物质所起的生物化学作用，以及水的温度和溶解的气体所引起人体上的各种反应的结果。矿水的治疗作用，我们的祖先早就知道了，我国很多矿泉都早已用来治病。
    当我们了解了上述道理时，我们就知道了“乌尼阿尔山”泉水并不是什么神奇的水。它们的秘密也同自然界的一切现象一样，在不断地被人们所识破，并被人们利用。据不完全统计，我国已知的各种矿泉已有七百多个，这是我国宝贵的天然资源。在苏联和其他国家，目前对地下泉的利用，已不只限于治病，还利用它们的高温和蒸气压力来发电、取暖和从中提取化学工业原料。我国现在也正在研究逐步地扩大对它们的利用。如果各地发现有所谓“奇异的泉水”的话，应该及时报告当地政府，并且加以保护。
