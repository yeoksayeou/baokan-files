Since opening the "Letters" column on this page in April, we have received care from our broad readership. You often write to give our work enthusiastic encouragement and help, for which we are very grateful. In order to make the "Letters" column better and to enrich and diversify the content, we hope that readers will frequently write about the problems, opinions, requests, and moving deeds encountered in their work and life. In addition to letters, the style can also take the form of poetry and paintings.

专栏：读者编者往来

　　寄读者
    4月份本版开辟“来信”专栏后，受到广大读者的关怀，经常来信对我们的工作给以热情的鼓励和帮助，我们非常感谢。为了把“来信”栏编得更好，使内容丰富多样，我们希望读者经常把工作与生活中所遇到的问题、意见、要求以及动人的事迹写来，体裁除了来信以外，还可以用诗和画等形式。
