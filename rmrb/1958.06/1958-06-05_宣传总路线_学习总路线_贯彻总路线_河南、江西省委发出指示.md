Henan and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committees Issue Instructions

(This dispatch from our newspaper in Zhengzhou) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on June 2nd to the local, city, and county committees regarding vigorously publicizing the general line of socialist construction. The instructions require party committees at all levels to launch a broad and in-depth publicity campaign, in conjunction with the dissemination of the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.

The instructions state: It is necessary to combine the dissemination of the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, organize all cadres above the district and township levels to immediately study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and list these documents as the main content of the fourth stage of the rectification campaign. Combined with the study of the documents, further examine and criticize various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking.

The instructions state: A publicity campaign should be quickly launched among the broad masses. Leading party and government cadres at all levels and summer harvesting and planting work teams should personally report to the masses, and quickly organize active elements from cadres, party members, and the masses into a massive publicity force to carry out in-depth publicity and explanation, conveying the general line of socialist construction to every township, cooperative, factory, mine, street, school, and store, so that it is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Special attention should be paid to closely linking it with current work and production, using the general line as a weapon, and using the methods of big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters to review and summarize work, affirm achievements, promote advanced experiences, criticize various ideological tendencies that are not conducive to the realization of the general line, and revise the leap forward plan.

(This dispatch from our newspaper in Nanchang) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions to party organizations at all levels throughout the province to vigorously launch a publicity campaign on the general line of socialist construction, requiring all localities to mobilize and organize millions of publicity troops to carry out a deep, lively, and vivid publicity and education movement on the general line of socialism throughout the province, so that everyone knows and understands it, and that the people of the whole province unite under the red banner of the general line and bravely advance along the road of socialist construction.

The instructions require that leading personnel at all levels and all cadres deeply study the general line in conjunction with the rectification campaign and the review of work; and that a nationwide discussion be launched among the broad masses in conjunction with production and various tasks on "Why do we need the general line? What are the benefits of the general line? Who do we rely on to realize the general line? Why should we liberate our thinking? What are our tasks?"

The Provincial Party Committee requires leading cadres of party organizations at all levels to write a lively and vivid understanding and essay on studying the general line in July and August, based on the actual situation of their region and department.
