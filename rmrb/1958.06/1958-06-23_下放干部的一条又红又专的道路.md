    A Red and Expert Path for Cadres Sent to Lower Levels
    By Our Own Commentator
    The cadres from Beijing's various universities who have been sent to lower levels have done something very meaningful. They have actively participated in the rural technical and cultural revolutions, helping farmers to vigorously develop local industries and schools. This not only provides technical and cultural support for the vigorous development of technical and cultural revolutions in rural areas, but also provides a red and expert path for general intellectual cadres who go to the countryside and mountains to participate in labor training.
    Speaking of "red," some comrades may feel that we have always emphasized the importance of labor in transforming ideology. Now, if we also emphasize participation in technical and cultural revolutions, will this lead people to neglect the significance of labor training? It will not. The cadres from Beijing's universities who have been sent to lower levels are participating in these activities while also engaging in agricultural labor. Moreover, participating in cultural revolution, especially technical revolution, is an activity that involves both mental and manual labor. Currently, the development of local industries and the innovation of farm tools in rural areas include a considerable amount of physical labor. It is not like conducting experiments and designs in a university laboratory or design institute, where one only uses the brain and rarely uses the hands. Of course, the main significance of participating in technical and cultural revolutions for "redness" lies not only in the fact that these activities are not completely detached from physical labor, but also in the fact that technical and cultural revolutions are revolutions, and those who participate in such revolutions must have revolutionary will. Although technical and cultural revolutions are different from social revolutions, they also require arduous struggles, including arduous ideological struggles. On the other hand, technical and cultural revolutions are carried out on the basis of backward technology and culture, and even start from scratch. For example, to build a factory, one has to run around to find materials and resources, build factory buildings and install equipment with one's own hands, and solve countless technical problems without sufficient technical guidance and established rules to follow... Without a high degree of responsibility and enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside and serving the working people, one will be timid and retreat in the face of these difficulties. The experience of the cadres from Peking University who were sent to lower levels in using walnut shells to trial-produce activated carbon well illustrates this point. Those who have no affection for the countryside and only seek personal ease will either be deterred by difficulties before they even start, or give up after a few perfunctory experiments. Only in the hands of those who love the peasants and are determined to contribute their strength to the construction of a new countryside can this experiment finally succeed after more than fifty failures. This is a good test of the degree of "redness" of the cadres sent to lower levels, and also an exercise for them to strive to be even redder and more thorough. Engaging in cultural and technical revolutions will inevitably enable the cadres sent to lower levels to further contact the peasants and understand the countryside. Doing these things requires not only the cultural and technical knowledge of the cadres sent to lower levels, but also the rich practical experience of the peasants. Only when the two are closely combined can something be achieved. This will prompt the cadres sent to lower levels to learn more modestly from the peasants, study together with the peasants, first be students of the masses and then be teachers of the masses, truly integrate with the masses, and have common thoughts and feelings with the masses.
    When the slogan of being "red in the countryside and expert in the countryside" was put forward, it caused a debate. Some people believed that since one should be "red in the countryside," one should be "expert in the countryside"; others believed that as long as one is "red in the countryside," it is not necessary to be "expert in the countryside." Those who hold the latter view do not understand that "expertise" includes two aspects: social sciences and natural sciences. For cadres sent to lower levels who study social sciences, the countryside is a very broad field of "expertise." They can conduct investigations of the political and economic situation in rural areas; they can learn how to correctly handle contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy from rural cadres handling problems and personally participating in some practical struggles in rural areas; they can study the issue of agricultural cooperation... For those who study natural sciences, the countryside is also a good place to make a difference. Because the current countryside is different from the countryside of the past, it requires both physical labor and mental labor. It is wrong to regard agricultural labor as simply repetitive physical labor. There is now a lot of creative labor in agricultural labor that combines physical and mental labor, and this creative labor contains a certain amount of wisdom and technology. For example, in the past, a yield of 200 jin per mu was considered very high, but now it is required to reach 300 jin, 500 jin, or even 1,000 jin, 2,000 jin, or 3,000 jin. It is impossible to achieve such high standards with simple repetitive labor. More importantly, a technical revolution has now been launched in rural areas, and in the near future, tractors, harvesters, seeders, and various new types of agricultural tools will be everywhere in the countryside. If the cadres sent to lower levels do not have certain specialized agricultural knowledge and agricultural technology, they will not be able to engage in agricultural production labor. The intellectuals from Beijing's universities who have been sent to the countryside have already come into contact with this problem.
    The rural technical and cultural revolutions have a wide scope, including not only agriculture but also industry; they require not only general cultural knowledge but also specialized knowledge, such as mechanics, power, chemistry, and so on. This makes it relatively easy to combine with the original specialties of some cadres sent to lower levels, allowing them to give full play to their expertise in a certain field, and to further enrich and deepen their professional knowledge in the practice of jointly carrying out technical and cultural revolutions with the masses, so that they can become more specialized and more profound.
    However, in the work of assisting peasants in carrying out technical and cultural revolutions, there are also some people whose work cannot be combined with their original specialties. In this case, as long as these people learn while doing, they can quickly master specialized knowledge and technology in one or several aspects, and this knowledge cannot be learned from books in the past. Of course, specializing in something new is not an easy task, and one will certainly encounter many difficulties. However, cadres sent to lower levels generally have a certain amount of cultural and technical knowledge, and as long as they have determination, perseverance, and a heart that loves the countryside and the peasants, and are good at learning from the peasants, they will definitely be able to learn and do at the same time, doing well and learning well.
    May all the intellectuals who have been sent to the countryside learn from the cadres of intellectuals who have been sent to lower levels by Beijing universities, actively participate in technical and cultural revolutions, and take the path of being both red and expert.

    下放干部的一条又红又专的道路
    本报评论员
    北京各高等学校的下放干部做了一件十分有意义的事情。他们积极参加农村的技术革命和文化革命，帮助农民大办地方工业和学校。这样做，不仅使农村大闹技术革命和文化革命有了技术力量和文化力量的支援，而且给下乡上山劳动锻炼的一般知识分子干部找到了一条又红又专的道路。
    提起红，有些同志可能会觉得我们一向强调劳动对于改造思想的重要，现在又强调参加技术革命和文化革命，这是不是会使人忽视劳动锻炼的意义呢？不会。北京各高等学校的下放干部是在参加农业劳动的同时又参加这些活动的。而且，参加文化革命特别是技术革命又是手脑并用的活动，目前农村里兴办地方工业进行农具革新都包括有相当多的体力劳动，并不像坐在大学的试验室或设计院里搞试验和设计那样只动脑而很少动手。当然，参加技术革命和文化革命对于红的意义，主要的还不在于这些活动并不完全脱离体力劳动，而在于技术革命和文化革命是一个革命，参加这种革命的人，就要有革命的意志。技术革命和文化革命虽然不同于社会革命，但是同样要进行艰苦的斗争，其中包括思想方面的艰苦的斗争。另一方面，技术革命文化革命都是在落后的技术、文化基础上进行的，甚至是白手起家。比如办工厂，要东奔西跑地去找材料寻资源，要自己动手修盖厂房安装设备，要在没有足够的技术指导和成规可循的情况下解决无数技术上的疑难问题……，没有对于建设社会主义新农村和为劳动人民服务的高度的责任心和热情，就会在这些困难面前胆怯和退却。北京大学下放干部利用核桃壳试制活性炭的经过，就很好地说明了这个问题。那些对农村没有感情只图个人轻松的人去搞试验，不是没有动手就被困难吓退，就是草草试验几次就打退堂鼓。只有到了热爱农民决心为建设新农村贡献自己力量的人手里，这一试验才在五十多次失败后终于成功。这是对下放干部红的程度的很好的考验，也是对他们力求红得更深更透的一种锻炼。从事文化革命和技术革命，还必然要使下放干部进一步地接触农民了解农村。做这些事情，既需要下放干部的文化技术知识，又需要农民丰富的实际经验，只有二者密切结合，才能有所作为。这就促使下放干部更加虚心地向农民学习，同农民一块研究，先做群众的学生后做群众的先生，真正同群众打成一片，和群众具有共同的思想感情。
    在提出红在农村专在农村的口号的时候，曾引起一场争论，一部分人认为既然要红在农村就应当专在农村；一部分人认为只要红在农村，不必专在农村。持后一种意见的人是不了解“专”包括了两方面的内容，一是社会科学，一是自然科学。对于研究社会科学的下放干部来说，农村是“专”的十分广阔的园地。可以做农村政治、经济情况的调查；可以从农村干部处理问题，和亲身参加农村的一些实际斗争中，学会如何正确处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾；可以研究农业合作化问题……。对于研究自然科学的人，农村也是大有可为的好天地。因为现在的农村，已不同于从前的农村，既需要体力劳动，又需要脑力劳动。把农业劳动当做只是简单的重复的体力劳动，那是不对的。现在的农业劳动中，有不少是体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的创造性的劳动，这种创造性的劳动，都包含着一定的智慧和一定的技术。例如过去一亩地收二百斤已是很高的产量，现在不是要求三百斤、五百斤，而是要求一千斤、两千斤、三千斤，用简单的重复的劳动，无论如何是达不到这样高的标准的。更重要的，现在农村又掀起了技术革命，在不久的将来农村将到处是拖拉机、收割机、播种机和各种各样的新式农具。下放干部如果没有一定的专门的农业知识和农业技术，是无法从事农业生产劳动的。北京各高等学校的下放到农村的知识分子，已经接触到了这个问题。
    农村技术革命、文化革命，范围很广，不仅有农业，还有工业；不仅需要一般的文化知识，还需要专门的知识，如机械、动力、化学等等。这就比较容易和有些下放干部原有的专业结合起来，可以发挥自己对某一方面的专长，而且可以在和群众共同进行技术革命、文化革命的实践中更加充实更加丰富自己的专业知识，使自己专得更好更深。
    但是，在协助农民进行技术革命、文化革命的工作中，也有一部分人和自己原有的专业结合不起来的。在这种情况下，这些人只要一面学一面做，很快可以掌握某一方面或几方面的专门知识和技术，而且这知识还是过去书本上学不来的。当然，要专一门新的东西，并不是那么容易的事情，一定会遇到很多困难。但是，下放干部一般都有一定的文化技术知识，只要有决心、有毅力，有一颗热爱农村和农民的心，再加上善于向农民学习，就一定可以边学边做，既做得好也学得好。
    愿全体下放到农村的知识分子，都来学习北京高等学校的下放的知识分子干部，积极参加技术革命和文化革命，走又红又专的道路。
