    A Good Example of Technical Revolution and Cultural Revolution
    ——Introducing the Experiences of Yexian Xianfeng Cooperative in Technical Revolution and Cultural Revolution
    Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee
    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China established the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," and timely proposed the great historical tasks of technical revolution and cultural revolution to the Party and the people of the whole country. This has made the entire Party and the people of the whole country more clearly see the direction and specific path of their advancement. In order to achieve this great historical task, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us: we must resolutely eliminate the sense of inferiority, chop away the psychology of underestimating ourselves, being content with backwardness, break superstitions, liberate our minds, and establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. That is to say, in the new period of great socialist construction, we must have the great revolutionary spirit of soaring enthusiasm, fearing no difficulties, daring to break and daring to establish, and the fearless creative spirit, just as we did in the past revolutionary periods.
    With the development of the rectification movement and the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings, Shandong Province, like all fraternal regions in the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the main leadership of the Party at all levels is turning to the technical revolution and cultural revolution. A large number of creations and inventions have emerged among the workers and peasants, and a vigorous and large-scale upsurge of technical revolution and cultural revolution is taking shape. The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiyou Township, Yexian County, Laiyang Prefecture, starting from the needs of production and life in its own cooperative, pooled its efforts, worked hard, and marched towards technology and culture, making good achievements. It is a banner for all agricultural production cooperatives in our province, under the leadership of the Party, to carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and a good example of technical revolution and cultural revolution in our province.
    This cooperative has a total of 813 households and 4,700 mu of cultivated land. In 1957, the average yield per mu was 721 jin of grain. In order to bring agricultural production to a new and higher level, Zhang Yongmao, the director of the cooperative, under the leadership of the Party branch, adopted a series of specific measures for the technical revolution and cultural revolution according to the actual situation of the cooperative. First, they established specialized agricultural technology research organizations mainly composed of young people; second, they allocated large tracts of land and set up 46 various experimental fields and large-scale high-yield fields; third, they established a spare-time technical night school with 194 students, divided into four classes: advanced, intermediate, elementary, and breeding; fourth, they set up an agricultural technology exhibition room with physical objects as the main content and accompanied by various specimens, charts, and instruments; fifth, they also established a small machinery manufacturing factory to manufacture various machines themselves. In this cooperative, they are engaged in studying the growth of various crops under various soil, climate, and other natural conditions; studying the water and nutrients required by various crops; studying the varieties of various crops and carrying out artificial hybridization and breeding of new varieties; studying the prevention of wheat lodging, the development laws and prevention methods of various diseases and insect pests, and various technologies of cultivation and close planting; studying the feeding, management, breeding, and epidemic prevention of livestock; and detailed records are also made of daily climate changes. In their spare-time technical night school, the director of the cooperative serves as the principal, and the secretary of the Party general branch serves as the political instructor. They adopt the method of "self-study and self-teaching, learning and teaching at the same time, and mutual learning and mutual teaching," cultivating eight members with higher cultural levels (junior high school and higher primary school graduates) as teachers, forming a teaching and research group, collecting materials from textbooks, newspapers, pamphlets, and other aspects, and combining them with the actual experience of the cooperative to compile their own teaching materials. Now all eight of their teachers can teach independently. Students are divided into groups for crops, horticulture, farm tools, and plant diseases and insect pests according to their strengths and interests, attending six classes a week in the evening, and adopting a method that combines listening to lectures, discussions, and practical production activities. Therefore, the students' interest in learning is getting higher and higher. Their small machinery manufacturing factory has reformed and trial-produced more than 30 kinds of farm tools. They have not only boldly reformed various old-fashioned farm tools, but also designed and manufactured machines themselves, such as flour mills that can produce 10,000 jin of flour per day, feed crushers that can produce 4,000 jin per day, and horse-drawn ten-row seeders. These machines are low in cost, highly efficient, and suitable for use. In their collective pigsties, the breeders, based on the principle of conditioned reflexes, adopted the method of using whistles to command urination and defecation, and all the pigs were tamed by them. Therefore, all comrades who have visited this cooperative have praised their achievements and their fearless creative spirit.
    It should be pointed out that the achievements made by the Xianfeng Cooperative are not due to any special conditions or secrets. They have neither university students nor technical experts. Like all other agricultural production cooperatives, the members are ordinary farmers, carpenters, and blacksmiths, and their cultural and technical levels are not very high. However, starting from the actual needs of their own cooperative, they resolutely eliminated the sense of inferiority, chopped away the psychology of underestimating themselves and being content with backwardness, broke superstitions, believed in their own strength, and established the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Therefore, they have made extraordinary achievements in the technical revolution and cultural revolution. The facts of this cooperative once again vividly illustrate that the working people are the creators of history, and that the working people have boundless and great wisdom and creative ability. At the same time, it powerfully refutes various special theorists. Some comrades always think that others have good conditions and they have poor conditions, using this as an excuse to cover up the essence of their right-leaning thinking. This fact vividly illustrates that as long as we boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and believe in the masses, and earnestly study, there is no problem that cannot be solved and no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Their experience is not only of great significance to a cooperative in carrying out the technical revolution and cultural revolution, but also provides good experience for the entire Party on how to lead this revolution.
    However, there are still many comrades who do not fully realize this. They always regard science, technology, and culture as very mysterious, as if they are out of reach, and believe that only intellectuals and scientists can invent and create, while the workers and peasants are powerless. When it comes to technical revolution and cultural revolution, and scientific research, they always feel that there are many difficulties and that it is impossible to break through. They are superstitious about the ancients, superstitious about foreigners, superstitious about intellectuals, superstitious about experts, superstitious about the ideological habits left over from the old society, and superstitious about their own old experiences. These superstitions are all things that bind our minds and are extremely harmful ideas. In fact, countless historical facts have repeatedly shown that all inventions and creations in the world mostly come from the oppressed classes, from the working people, from those who are in lower positions, have less knowledge, have poorer conditions, and are always looked down upon at the beginning, and even suffer blows, torture, and executions. This is how it has been in history, and today, when the working people have been unprecedentedly and thoroughly liberated, when enthusiasm is soaring everywhere, and the buds of technical revolution are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the incomparable heroic spirit of the working people is appearing everywhere, what difficulties cannot be overcome? It seems that the key issue lies in leadership. Therefore, I propose that all levels of Party and government leading cadres in the province should attach importance to and earnestly study and promote the experience of the Xianfeng Cooperative in Yexian County, and thoroughly break superstitions. We must, like the Xianfeng Cooperative, believe in ourselves, earnestly study, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, believe in the masses, not bow our heads in the face of difficulties, and bravely march towards the great goals of technical revolution and cultural revolution, so that the flowers of technology and culture will bloom all over our province. In order to, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, ensure the realization of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and ensure the historical task of completing the great technical revolution and cultural revolution in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.

    技术革命和文化革命的好榜样
    ——介绍掖县先锋社技术革命和文化革命的经验
    中共山东省委书记处书记　谭启龙
    党的第八届全国代表大会第二次会议确定了党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，并适时地向党和全国人民提出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大历史任务，这就使全党和全国人民更加清楚地看见了自己前进的方向和具体道路。为了实现这个伟大历史任务，党中央和毛主席曾反复地教导我们：一定要坚决地打掉自卑感，斫掉妄自菲薄、自甘落后的心理，破除迷信，解放思想，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。这就是说，要我们在伟大社会主义建设的新时期，必须和过去各个革命时期那样，具有干劲冲天，不怕一切困难，敢破敢立的伟大革命气概和大无畏的创造精神。
    随着整风运动的开展和工农业生产及各项事业大跃进的新形势，山东省和全国各兄弟地区一样，在党中央的正确领导下，各级党的主要领导精力都正在转向技术革命和文化革命方面来。在工农群众中已经出现了大量的创造发明，一个蓬蓬勃勃、规模壮阔的技术革命和文化革命的高潮正在形成。莱阳专区掖县西由乡先锋农业生产合作社，从自己社里的生产、生活需要出发，群策群力，刻苦钻研，向技术和文化进军，作出了很好的成绩。它是我省所有农业生产合作社在党的领导下，进行技术革命和文化革命的一面旗帜，是我省技术革命和文化革命的一个好榜样。
    这个合作社共计八百一十三户，耕地四千七百亩，1957年平均亩产粮食七百二十一斤。他们为了把农业生产提到一个新的更高的水平，社主任张永茂同志在党支部的领导下，根据该社的实际情况，对技术革命和文化革命采取了一系列的具体措施。第一，他们以青年人为主建立了分科分类的农业技术研究组织；第二，他们拨出了大片土地，设立了四十六项各种各样的试验田和大面积丰产田；第三，他们设立了有一百九十四人的业余技术夜校，并分高、中、初、饲养四个班；第四，他们设立了以实物为主并附有各种标本图表仪器的农业技术展览室；第五，他们还建立了一个小型机械制造工厂，自己制造各种机器。在这个合作社里，他们正从事研究各种农作物在各种土壤、气候等自然条件下的生长情况；研究各种农作物所需要的水量和营养；研究各种农作物的品种以及进行人工杂交、培育新品种的工作；研究预防小麦倒伏、各种病虫害的发展规律防治办法和耕作、密植各项技术；研究牲畜的饲养、管理、繁殖和防疫工作；对每日气候变化亦作了详细纪录。他们的业余技术夜校，社主任兼校长，党总支书记任政治教员，采取“自学自教、边学边教和互学互教”的办法，培养了八名文化程度较高的（初中、高小毕业）社员作教员，组成教学研究组，从课本、报刊、小册子等各方面收集材料，结合本社的实际经验，自己编写讲义，现在他们八个教员都能单独开课了。学员根据自己的长处和兴趣，分作物、园艺、农具、病虫害等小组，每周凑晚上的时间上六次课，并且采取听课、讨论和实际生产行动相结合的办法，因此学员的学习兴趣越来越高。他们的小型机械制造工厂，改革试制了三十多种农具，他们不仅对各种各样旧式农具进行了大胆的改革，而且自己设计制造机器。如日出万斤面的磨粉机，日产四千斤的饲料粉碎机，以及马拉十行播种机等，这些机器成本低，效率高，而且适用。在他们的集体猪栏里，饲养员根据条件反射的原理，采取吹哨子指挥大小便的办法，所有的猪都被他们驯服了。因此，凡是到过这个社参观的同志们，都无不纷纷赞扬他们的成绩和那种大无畏的创造精神。
    应该指出，先锋社做出的这些成绩，并没有什么特殊条件和秘诀，他们既无大学生，也无技术专家，他们和所有其它农业生产合作社一样，社员都是普通农民、木匠和铁匠，文化水平技术水平也不很高，可是他们从自己社的实际需要出发，坚决的打掉自卑感，斫掉妄自菲薄的自甘落后的心理，破除迷信，相信自己的力量，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，因而，他们就在技术革命和文化革命方面做出了不平凡的事迹。这个社的事实，又一次生动地说明了劳动人民是历史的创造者，在劳动人民中蕴藏着无穷无尽的伟大的智慧和创造能力。同时有力地驳倒了各种各样的特殊论者。有些同志总是认为人家的条件好，自己的条件差，以此为借口来掩盖自己的右倾思想本质。这一事实，生动地说明了任何事情，只要放手发动群众，依靠群众，相信群众，认真的钻研，就没有解决不了的问题，没有克服不了的困难。他们的经验不仅对一个合作社进行技术革命和文化革命有重大意义，而且对全党如何领导这个革命提供了很好的经验。
    可是，现在还有好多同志，并不完全认识到这一点，他们总是把科学、技术、文化看得很神秘，好像高不可攀，认为只有知识分子、科学家才能发明创造，而工农劳动群众是无能为力的。提起技术革命和文化革命，提起科学研究，他们总是感到困难重重，不可冲破。他们迷信古人，迷信外国人，迷信知识分子，迷信专家，迷信旧社会遗留下来的思想习惯，迷信自己老一套的经验。这些迷信，都是束缚我们头脑的东西，是极为有害的思想。其实，无数历史事实一再说明，世界上的所有创造发明，大都出于被压迫阶级，出于劳动人民，出于那些地位较低、学问较少、条件较差、在开始时总是被人看不起、甚至受打击、受折磨、受刑戮的那些人。历史上如此，而在劳动人民已经空前彻底解放了的今天，到处都在干劲冲天，技术革命的萌芽已如雨后春笋，劳动人民的无比英雄气概到处出现，还有什么困难不可以克服的吗？看来，关键的问题在于领导。因此，我提议：全省各级党政领导干部，都要重视和认真地学习和推广掖县先锋社的经验，彻底破除迷信。要和先锋社一样，相信自己，认真钻研，充分发动群众，依靠群众，相信群众，不在困难面前低头，勇敢地向技术革命和文化革命的伟大目标进军，使技术和文化的花朵在我省遍地开放。以便在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，保证党的社会主义建设总路线的实现，保证多快好省地完成伟大的技术革命和文化革命的历史任务。
