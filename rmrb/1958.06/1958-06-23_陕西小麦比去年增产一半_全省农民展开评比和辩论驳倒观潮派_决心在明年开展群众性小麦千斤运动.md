    Shaanxi Wheat Production Increased by Half Compared to Last Year
    Farmers Throughout the Province Conducted Assessments and Debates, Refuting the "Wait-and-See" Faction
    Determined to Launch a Mass Wheat Thousand-Jin Movement Next Year
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 22nd dispatch, reporter Wang Yong) The question of whether wheat production can be rapidly increased has been discussed by cadres and farmers in Shaanxi Province recently. Through the fact of this year's bumper wheat harvest, they have implemented the spirit of the general line for socialist construction, widely held on-site observations and assessments of wheat high-yield fields, and debated this issue. The masses in various localities visited the large number of high-yield fields that emerged this year, summarized the experiences of high-yield, strengthened their belief that man can conquer nature, and swept away conservative ideas such as "wait-and-see" and "settling accounts after the autumn harvest," laying the ideological foundation for accelerating wheat production next year.
    This year, Shaanxi Province has achieved a bumper wheat harvest. The total estimated output of wheat in the province's more than 24 million mu can reach about 5 billion jin, an increase of 51.5% compared to last year, and 6.8% higher than the largest bumper harvest year since liberation – 1956.
    This year, Shaanxi Province's wheat harvest was a great success, with large-scale high-yield becoming a common phenomenon. According to preliminary investigations: Zhouzhi, Hu County, Gaoling, Chang'an and Xi'an, Xianyang, Hanzhong and other seven counties and cities, the average yield per mu reached more than 400 jin; more than 100,000 mu yielded more than 500 jin per mu; more than 20,000 mu yielded more than 800 jin per mu; the bumper harvest of 1956 only had 24 mu reaching 1,000 jin, but this year, with a leap forward, 1,560 mu all yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu. High-yield fields are no longer sporadic small plots, but have appeared in blocks and pieces. The Weinan Heping Agricultural Cooperative has 2,565 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 573 jin per mu. Among them, 75 mu yielded more than 1,000 jin. In the gully area of the Weibei Plateau, 40 mu of wheat in the Pucheng County Huifeng Cooperative exceeded 1,000 jin. Since late May, the province has organized large-scale on-site observations and evaluations. Various localities used the method of visiting, evaluating, and debating to discuss how the bumper harvest came about, summarize the experiences of the wheat bumper harvest, and criticize "wait-and-see" and other conservative ideas, using the facts of the local wheat bumper harvest.
    Cadres and the masses in various localities unanimously agreed during on-site visits, evaluations, and debates that this year's wheat harvest came from overcoming various natural disasters. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province launched large-scale anti-drought wheat planting and watering campaigns last autumn and this spring, and also launched an unprecedented large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement, applying four to five large carts of fertilizer to wheat fields, exceeding 50% to 100% of previous years. This year, in the prevention and control of wheat sucking bugs, various localities, under the slogan of "treat when there are bugs, prevent even when there are no bugs," also did a better job than in previous years, spraying pesticides once or twice in areas with insect pests, and many places even reached three times. Therefore, this year the spread and harm of wheat sucking bugs was stopped. Because this year's wheat grew particularly well, the masses of farmers also fought against lodging in the later stages of wheat field management. One by one, various natural disasters were overcome, and an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. After visits and debates, the broad masses of cadres and people further established the idea that "man can conquer nature," and refuted the "wait-and-see" and passive wait-for-heaven ideas. In the past, some people doubted that wheat yields in the dry land of the plateau could not be rapidly increased. This year, the 13 mu of dry land wheat planted by the Nanwu Village Agricultural Cooperative in Dazhao Yuan, Chang'an County, used iron shovels to turn the land, and after three harrows and seven rollings after the rain, water was stored and moisture was conserved, and after topdressing, insecticidal and other processing management, the average yield per mu was more than 800 jin, more than doubling the yield of ordinary dry land wheat in the area. In the past, some people were worried about the replanting of stubble wheat, because the previous crop had exhausted the fertility of the land, and they were afraid that it could not increase production. This year, the stubble wheat in Tongguan County's Tongqiao Township grew as well as the regular wheat. More than 4,000 mu of stubble wheat in the township yielded an average of more than 300 jin per mu in irrigated land and 180 jin per mu in dry land, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. In the past, some agricultural technicians and the masses believed that many wheat varieties in the province were not resistant to fertilizer, and too much fertilizer would cause the wheat to lodge and reduce production. Therefore, they believed that the current wheat varieties were not high-yield crops, and it was difficult to produce 1,000 jin per mu. However, the more than 400 mu of 1,000-jin wheat that appeared in various places this year did not show any lodging. The eight mu of "1,000-jin mu" wheat in the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, had particularly thick stalks and did not lodge. Many agricultural technicians visited and inquired about the farming methods of the cooperative's farmers to prevent lodging, and believed that the farmers' production practice gave them a vivid lesson.
    After large-scale on-site visits, evaluations, and debates, Shaanxi Province also gained a great ideological harvest on the basis of obtaining a bumper wheat harvest. Cadres and the masses in various localities realized that high wheat yields are entirely possible, and the key depends on human effort. After summarizing the wheat production experience of this year, cadres and the masses in various localities were full of confidence and energy, and formulated plans for high-speed wheat production increase next year. They strive to make Gaoling and other three counties in the Guanzhong area 1,000-jin counties next year, and Wugong and other thirteen counties strive to become 500-jin counties, with a speed 60% to one time faster than this year. Now various localities are proposing specific measures to change natural conditions and strive for a bumper wheat harvest according to local natural conditions. These measures are: 1. Deep plowing. Five million mu of fallow wheat land in Guanzhong will be turned over with iron shovels to a depth of eight inches to one foot, and generally five to eight inches. 2. Increase the application of base fertilizer. Strive to reach 8,000 to 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and more than 20,000 jin for high-yield fields. 3. Promote superior varieties, implement variety combinations, actively explore disease-resistant and high-yielding local varieties, cooperatives should reserve enough seeds, teams should establish seed fields, and everyone should carefully select superior varieties. 4. Narrow row uniform sowing, reasonable close planting. 5. Strengthen field management. In areas with water conservancy conditions, four fertilizations and four waterings should be done. Dry land should be topdressed at least once or twice. Winter hoeing, winter harrowing (rolling), insect prevention, frost prevention, and disease prevention are universally promoted. It is required that the Party Committee secretaries in various localities personally take command, the whole Party should get involved, and launch a mass wheat 1,000-jin movement.

    陕西小麦比去年增产一半
    全省农民展开评比和辩论驳倒观潮派
    决心在明年开展群众性小麦千斤运动
    本报西安22日电  记者王永报道：小麦产量能不能迅速增长？最近，陕西省各地干部和农民，通过今年小麦大丰收的事实，贯彻社会主义建设总路线的精神，广泛地举行了小麦丰产现场观摩、评比，并对这个问题展开了辩论。各地群众参观了今年涌现的大量高额丰产田，总结了丰产经验，坚定了人定胜天的信念，扫荡了“观潮”和“秋后算账”等保守思想，为明年加快小麦增产速度，打下了思想基础。
    今年，陕西省小麦获得大丰收。全省两千四百多万亩小麦估计总产量可以达到五十亿斤左右，比去年提高了51.5％，比解放以来最大的丰收年——1956年的产量还高了6.8％。
    今年陕西省小麦获得大丰收，大面积丰产成普遍现象。据初步调查：盩厔、鄠县、高陵、长安和西安、咸阳、汉中等七个县市，平均亩产都达到四百斤以上；亩产五百斤以上的，有十万多亩；亩产八百斤的有两万多亩；大丰收的1956年还只有二十四亩达到千斤，今年一个飞跃，有一千五百六十亩地都亩产千斤以上。高额丰产田，已不再是零星小块，而是成块成片地出现了。渭南和平农业社，全社二千五百六十五亩小麦，平均亩产五百七十三斤。其中七十五亩都是千斤以上。渭北高原沟壑地区的蒲城县会丰社四十亩小麦都超过了千斤。从5月下旬以来，全省组织了大规模的现场观摩、评比。各地用边参观、边评比、边辩论的办法，以当地小麦丰收的事实，讨论了丰收是怎样来的，总结了小麦丰收经验，批判了“观潮”以及各种保守思想。
    各地干部、群众在现场参观、评比和辩论中，一致认为今年小麦的丰收，是从战胜各种自然灾害中得来的。全省人民在党的领导下，去年秋季今年春季先后掀起了声势浩大的抗旱种麦和浇地运动，还开展了空前规模的积肥运动，给麦田施肥四至五大车，超过往年50％到100％。今年在防治小麦吸浆虫方面，各地在“有虫即治，无虫也防”的口号下，防治工作也比往年作得好，有虫害的都喷药一至两次，不少地方还达到三次，因此今年制止了吸浆虫的蔓延和危害。由于今年麦子生长的特别好，在后期的麦田管理上，农民群众还和倒伏现象进行了斗争。一一战胜了各种自然灾害，获得空前丰收。经过参观、辩论，广大干部群众进一步树立了“人定胜天”的思想，驳斥了“观潮”和消极等待的靠天思想。过去有些人怀疑高原旱地小麦产量不能迅速增长，今年，长安县大兆原南五村农业社种的十三亩旱地小麦，采用铁锨翻地，又经过雨后三耙、七耱，蓄水保墒，又经过追肥、杀虫等加工管理，平均亩产八百多斤，比当地一般旱地小麦增产一倍还多。过去有些人还担心复种的回茬小麦，因为前茬作物把地力拔尽，怕不能增产。今年潼关县同桥乡的回茬小麦和正茬小麦长得一样好。全乡四千多亩回茬小麦，水地平均亩产三百斤以上，旱地平均亩产一百八十斤，比去年提高30％还多。过去有些农业技术干部和群众以为本省的许多小麦品种耐肥力不强，施肥太多，就会使小麦倒伏减产。因此，他们认为当前的小麦品种不是高产作物，亩产千斤有困难。但今年各地出现的四百多亩千斤小麦，大都没有倒伏现象。西安市坝桥区五星农业社的八亩“千斤亩”小麦，秆茎特别粗壮，没有倒伏，许多农业技术人员参观时，访问了该社农民防止倒伏的耕作方法，认为农民的生产实践给自己上了生动的一课。
    经过大规模的现场观摩、评比和辩论，陕西省在获得小麦大丰收的基础上，也获得了思想上的大丰收。各地干部和群众认识到小麦高产是完全可能的，关键决定于人的作务。各地干部和群众在总结了今年的小麦生产经验后，信心百倍，干劲十足，纷纷制定明年高速度增产小麦的计划。争取关中地区的高陵等三个县明年成为千斤县，武功等十三个县争取成为五百斤县，速度比今年加快60％至一倍。现在各地正根据当地自然条件，提出改变自然条件争取小麦丰收的具体措施。这些措施是：一、深耕。关中歇茬麦地用铁锨翻地五百万亩，深达八寸到一尺，一般都深翻五至八寸。二、增施底肥。每亩施底肥量争取达到八千至一万斤，丰产田要达到两万斤以上。三、推广优良品种，实行品种组合，积极发掘抗病、丰产的农家良种，社社留足种子，队队建立种子地，人人精选良种。四、窄行匀播、合理密植。五、加强田间管理，有水利条件的地区要做到四肥四水，旱地至少要施一二次追肥，普遍提倡冬锄、冬耙（耱）、防虫、防霜冻、防病工作。要求各地党委书记亲自挂帅，全党动手，开展一个群众性的小麦千斤运动。
