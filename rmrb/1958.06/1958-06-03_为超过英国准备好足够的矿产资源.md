To prepare enough mineral resources to surpass Britain

He Changgong, Vice Minister of Geology

Recently, based on the general line of "go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" proposed by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the spirit of the Nanning and Chengdu Conferences, we have repeatedly studied the second five-year plan for geological work. We believe that it is entirely possible to prepare sufficient mineral resources for China's industry to surpass Britain within the second five-year plan. China is a vast country with many mountains, and the conditions for mineralization and prospecting are extremely favorable. We have explored 49 kinds of mineral raw materials during the first five-year plan. The reserves of various major minerals have basically guaranteed the needs of the second five-year plan. Among them, the proven reserves of tungsten, molybdenum, and tin rank first in the world, and iron, manganese, copper, lead, aluminum, coal, and phosphorus also rank among the top countries in the world. The geological team has grown to 230,000 people, including 5,100 geological personnel who graduated from universities and colleges after liberation, more than 12,000 students in geology departments of various geological colleges and comprehensive universities, and more than 3,000 more students will be enrolled this year. Students studying in the Soviet Union are also constantly returning home after completing their studies. This is a geological team equipped with modern technology, possessing more than 4,000 drilling rigs and a large number of precision instruments for geophysical, geochemical, rock and mineral identification, and chemical analysis. All of these are necessary material foundations for the continued great development of geological work.

Must Walk Ahead of Industrial Construction

During the second five-year plan, geological work must walk ahead of industrial construction, so that the various mineral resources needed for China's industrial construction can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. We have preliminarily planned to prove iron ore reserves of 9.4 billion tons in the second five-year plan. Together with the 5.6 billion tons proven in the first five-year plan, the cumulative industrial reserves of iron ore nationwide can reach 15 billion tons by the end of 1962, which can guarantee the needs of an annual output of 100 million tons of steel for about 50 years. The resources of the five large-scale steel plants in Anshan, Baotou, Daye, Xichang, and Jiuquan, and a number of small and medium-sized steel plants have been resolved during the first five-year plan. In the second five-year plan, we also plan to submit raw material bases for more than a dozen large-scale steel plants with an annual output of 1.5 million tons to 4 million tons, and a number of medium-sized steel plants, and provide reserves for the construction of more small-scale steel plants.

The proven industrial reserves of coal are 60 billion tons, which, together with the 54.4 billion tons proven in the first five-year plan, can guarantee the needs of an annual output of 1 billion tons of raw coal for about 50 years. In the second five-year plan, coal exploration should focus on the southern provinces to quickly change the situation of insufficient industrial and civilian coal in these areas.

In order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the cumulative proven reserves of mineral raw materials such as phosphorus, sulfur, limestone, and potassium by the end of 1962 will guarantee the construction scale of chemical fertilizer plants with an annual output of 60 million tons to 80 million tons.

Although more than 500 oil-bearing and potentially oil-bearing structures have been found in the oil prospecting work in the first five-year plan, and some promising oil prospects have been discovered, and some structures have been explored for petroleum with industrial value, the situation of oil resources is still very tight. During the second five-year plan, we must continue to vigorously strengthen work in the promising Sichuan Basin, Xinjiang area, Qaidam Basin, Songliao Plain, Jianghuai Plain, Jiangzhe area, and Guizhou area, closely combining prospecting, exploration, and scientific research, and quickly ascertain the oil prospects in the above areas. We believe that as long as all parties work together and closely cooperate, it is possible to find China's "Baku" during the second five-year plan. In order to implement the central government's policy of simultaneously developing natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum, we will also explore 4 billion tons of oil shale. Together with the 6.9 billion tons that have been explored in the first five-year plan, this can guarantee the needs of an annual output of 10 million tons of synthetic petroleum for about 30 years. At the same time, we can also propose a large number of reserves of oil refining coal.

"The development of the iron and steel industry should not only be reflected in quantity, but also strive for a simultaneous leap forward in quality." In order to strive to occupy the entire field of non-ferrous metals and rare metals in industry, we will submit all non-ferrous, rare metal, and dispersed element mineral reserves and necessary information.

The most critical chromium and nickel in the first five-year plan will improve the seriously insufficient situation during the second five-year plan.

After the above plan is realized, each economic cooperation zone in the country will have an iron ore base for one to four large-scale steel plants, and one to several large-scale non-ferrous metallurgical raw material bases; each province and autonomous region will have at least one medium-sized steel plant mineral raw material base and many small-scale mineral raw material bases. This can not only ensure that China's great leap forward in industry becomes possible, but also make China's industrial distribution more reasonable, and enable the policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry to be better realized.

It is difficult to complete the above plan, but we have the determination and courage to overcome all difficulties, and we firmly believe that the above plan can be completed and exceeded. The key is to implement the policy of the whole party running geology and the whole people running geology, and to liberate from the shackles of dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thinking.

The Whole Party Runs Geology, the Whole People Runs Geology

The whole party running geology, the whole people running geology, and thoroughly implementing the mass line in geological work is a fundamental issue to ensure the leap forward development of geological work. However, in a considerable period in the past, our understanding of this issue was insufficient. We had inappropriately emphasized the scientific and technical nature of geological work, and to some extent, mystified it, as if geological work was unattainable and could only be done by geological "experts." This has fostered the development of non-political tendencies in some people, limiting geological work to a narrow circle, and affecting the failure of geological work to develop faster. Some comrades underestimated the leading role of party committees at all levels, mistakenly believing that the development of geological work depended on the growth of geological technical forces, and that party committees could only lead political and ideological work and not geological work. For example, when geological bureaus were established in provinces and autonomous regions in 1956, some comrades believed that this would disperse the technical forces and affect the development of geological work. This was obviously a tendency to ignore the leadership of the party. Although we had launched mass reporting of mines, we lacked organizational measures and failed to help special districts and counties gradually establish geological institutions in a timely manner. We did not check the reported mineral deposits enough, and failed to give full play to the role of mass reporting of mines.

There are also such situations in the work methods within the geological department. Although some comrades "agreed" with the mass line in words, they often forgot the excellent mass work methods of our party when they encountered practical problems. For example, the captain of Yongxin Team, which belonged to the former Central South Geological Bureau, adopted the "three togethers" method of "eating, living, and working together" with the workers in order to mobilize the masses. Some people wrongly criticized this method as "old-fashioned," "empiricism," and "rural work method." Not enough attention was paid to the inventions, creations, and advanced experiences of workers and masses. Many of them were not summarized and promoted. The production efficiency between advanced units and backward units varied greatly. In the past few years, a number of advanced drilling rigs with a monthly progress of more than 1,000 meters have appeared, but there are still many backward drilling rigs with a monthly progress of 100 meters. In the use of technical cadres, we "emphasize the old and despise the young," underestimate the role of young technical cadres, and do not use them boldly enough. We look at geological work very mysteriously, as if only those who have received higher education can intervene. Due to this wrong thinking, a sense of inferiority has been created among the old cadres, who are in awe of geological science and dare not boldly lead geological work; among the technical cadres, it has fostered the wrong tendency of "technology first," "you rely on me for food," ignoring politics, ignoring the leading role of the party, and being only specialized but not red.

The facts fully prove that if we want to make a great leap forward in geological work, we must jump out of the narrow world, rely on the party committees of various places, and rely on the broad masses of the people. Since the establishment of geological bureaus in provinces and autonomous regions, the party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over geological work. Especially since 1957, due to the great impetus of the nationwide rectification movement and the impact of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the geological team has also experienced a high tide of production leap forward on the basis of in-depth rectification. New mining areas have been continuously discovered, production efficiency has been continuously improved, quotas have been continuously broken, and mineral reserves have been greatly increased. The chromium and nickel mines that have been most lacking in recent years have also greatly improved recently. The central Jiangxi iron ore has been confirmed as a large iron ore with reserves of more than 1 billion tons after only three months of work. Huge sand titanium iron ore and zircon stone deposits were discovered on Hainan Island. Drilling rigs with a monthly progress of 1,000 meters continue to appear. In April, a drilling rig with a monthly progress of 2,000 meters appeared, breaking the highest record of drilling efficiency in China. Especially after the Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy of combining the construction of large, medium, and small industrial enterprises and the policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, all localities have attached more importance to geological work, and a high tide of the whole party running geology and the whole people running geology has appeared in many places. Some provinces have begun to establish geological institutions in special districts and counties, and have transferred a group of cadres and students to run geological training classes for training; some counties have set up full-time mine reporting inspectors; many special districts and counties have set up mineral specimen exhibition rooms, and the responsible comrades of some county party committees personally led the masses to explore treasures in the mountains. A handicraft cooperative in Datong, Shanxi, in order to find minerals, crushed a 350-kilogram granite block, panned out heavy sand and sent it to the Ministry of Geology for testing. These moving deeds are now countless. It can be imagined that after the mass line is implemented, the face of geological work in China will change quickly.

Break Down Superstition, Decentralize the System

How can we realize the policy of the whole party running geology and the whole people running geology? We believe that the following issues must be resolved:

(1) Thoroughly break down superstition, eliminate the mysterious view of geological work, resolutely struggle against the tendency to ignore the leading role of the party and ignore politics, and ensure the absolute leadership of the party over geological work; in work methods, carry forward the party's mass work tradition and implement the mass line.

(2) Thoroughly change the current management system of geological work, decentralize the geological prospecting and exploration forces to provinces and autonomous regions, and the provincial and autonomous region party committees should comprehensively plan and uniformly arrange the geological work of the province according to needs and existing technical forces, under the principle of ensuring key points. The central competent department is mainly responsible for "overall planning, coordination and balance, technical assistance, inspection and summary."

(3) Gradually establish geological institutions in special districts and counties to bear the resources needed by small-scale industries in special districts and counties, and the hydrogeological and engineering geological work of small-scale farmland water conservancy. The technical forces needed to establish geological institutions in special districts and counties can be solved by running short-term crash courses, in addition to transferring a small number of technical personnel from the geological institutions of the geological, metallurgical, and coal departments of the existing provinces as technical backbones.

(4) Mass-produce and print popular geological books and small booklets of prospecting knowledge, carry out mass mine reporting and prospecting campaigns, strengthen the guidance of mass mine reporting and prospecting, and promptly inspect and evaluate the mine reporting points of the masses.

In short, the basic approach of geological work in the future should be the combination of professional departments and the broad masses, and the combination of popularization and improvement.

Another key issue to ensure the leap forward in geological work is that we must liberate ourselves from the shackles of dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thinking.

Many geologists left over from the old society worship the United Kingdom and the United States, are divorced from reality, do geology for geology's sake, do research for research's sake, and do not understand exploration and production at all. In the early days of liberation, there were almost no mineral reserves available for construction; cadres transferred from the party, government, and military to the geological department, except for a few who had studied geology in the past, most of them did not understand it at all. In the past few years, with the efforts of comrades and the help of Soviet experts, we have accumulated experience and achieved results. However, there are still serious phenomena of being divorced from China's actual situation when learning from foreign advanced experience. Too many rules and regulations have been copied and implemented too mechanically, resulting in great waste of manpower, material resources, and time.

During the "double anti" campaign, we organized a special group to review the old rules and regulations and formulate new rules and regulations, combined with the large-scale airing of views, debates, and arguments of the organs under the ministry, and revised and formulated new rules and regulations that are suitable for China's situation. According to this approach, we can achieve double the results with the same manpower and material resources.

China's geological conditions are good, and various mineral resources are very rich. We believe that under the illumination of the party's general line of building socialism, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the party committees at all levels, under the impetus of the nationwide rectification movement, as long as we break the shackles of dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thinking, break out of the narrow circle, mobilize all positive factors, and with the determination to swallow mountains and rivers, high morale, and riding the wind and waves, inspired by the national leap forward, we will be able to explore all the mineral resources needed for China's socialist construction.

　　为超过英国准备好足够的矿产资源
　　地质部副部长  何长工
    最近，我们根据中央和主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和南宁会议、成都会议的精神，反复研究了地质工作的第二个五年规划，认为在第二个五年内，为我国工业超过英国准备好足够的矿产资源是完全可能的。我国地大山多，成矿和找矿条件极为有利。我们已在第一个五年期间勘探了四十九种矿物原料，各种主要矿产储量已基本上保证了第二个五年建设的需要，其中钨、钼、锡的探明储量已居世界首位，铁、锰、铜、铅、铝、煤、磷等也已居世界各国的前列；地质队伍已发展到二十三万人，其中解放后大专毕业的地质人员五千一百人，各地质学院、各综合大学地质系在校学生一万二千余人，今年还将招生三千余人，赴苏留学生也不断学完回国。这是一支用现代化的技术装备起来的地质队伍，拥有钻机四千多台和大批地球物理、地球化学、岩矿鉴定、化学分析的精密仪器。所有这些，都是地质工作继续大发展的必要的物质基础。
　　必须走在工业建设的前面
    在第二个五年期间，地质工作必须走在工业建设的前面，使我国工业建设所需要的各种矿产资源得到最大限度的保证。我们初步规划，在第二个五年探明铁矿储量九十四亿吨，连同第一个五年探明的五十六亿吨，到一九六二年底，全国铁矿累计工业储量可达到一百五十亿吨，可以保证年产一亿吨钢铁的五十年左右的需要，鞍山、包头、大冶、西昌、酒泉等五个大型钢铁厂和若干中小型钢铁厂的资源已在第一个五年期间解决了。第二个五年还准备提交十几个年产一百五十万吨到四百万吨的大型钢铁厂和若干中型钢铁厂的原料基地，并为建设更多的小型钢铁厂提供储量。
    探明煤的工业储量六百亿吨，连同第一个五年探明的五百四十四亿吨，最少可以保证年产原煤十亿吨五十年左右的需要。第二个五年，煤的勘探应着重放在南方各省，以迅速改变这些地区的工业用煤和民用煤不足的情况。
    为了农业生产大跃进的需要，到一九六二年底累计探明的磷、硫、石灰岩、钾等矿物原料，将保证年产六千万吨到八千万吨化学肥料厂的建设规模。
    石油普查工作，虽然在第一个五年已经找到了五百多个储油和可能储油的构造，发现了一些有希望的含油远景地区，有些构造已探到了具有工业价值的石油，但至今石油资源情况仍然非常紧张。第二个五年内，对于有希望的四川盆地、新疆地区、柴达木盆地、松辽平原、江淮平原、江浙地区、贵州地区，必须继续大力加强工作，普查、勘探和科学研究密切结合，迅速查明上述地区的含油远景。我们相信只要各方面共同努力，密切配合，在第二个五年期间找到中国的“巴库”是有可能的。为了贯彻中央提出的天然石油与人造石油同时并举的方针，还将探明油页岩四十亿吨，连同第一个五年已探明的六十九亿吨，可以保证年产一千万吨人造石油三十年左右的需要。同时还可以提出大批炼油煤的储量。
    “钢铁工业的发展不仅应当表现在数量方面，而且应当争取在质量方面同时跃进”。为了争取在工业上占领有色金属、稀有金属的全部领域，将提交全部有色、稀有金属和分散元素的矿产储量和必要的资料。
    第一个五年最紧张的铬、镍，在第二个五年期间将会改善严重不足的情况。
    以上规划实现后，在全国的每一个经济协作区都有可供一个到四个的大型钢铁厂的铁矿基地，一个到几个的大型有色冶金原料基地；在每省、自治区至少有一个中型钢铁厂的矿物原料基地和许多小型的各种矿物原料基地。这样不仅可以保证我国工业大跃进成为可能，而且可以使我国的工业分布更为合理，使中央工业与地方工业同时并举的方针能更好地实现。
    完成上述规划是有一定困难的，但我们具有战胜一切困难的决心和勇气，深信是可以完成和超过上述规划的。关键是贯彻全党办地质、全民办地质的方针和从教条主义和右倾保守思想束缚下解放出来。
    全党办地质  全民办地质
    全党办地质、全民办地质，彻底实行地质工作的群众路线，是保障地质工作飞跃发展的一个根本性的问题。但是在过去一个相当时期内，我们对这个问题是认识不足的，我们曾不适当地强调过地质工作的科学性和技术性，在某种程度上把它神秘化起来，似乎地质工作高不可攀，非靠地质“专家”不行。这就助长了一些人的非政治倾向的发展，把地质工作局限在狭小的圈子里，影响地质工作未能更快的发展。有的同志对各级党委的领导作用估计不足，错误的以为地质工作的发展取决于地质技术力量的成长，党委只能领导政治思想工作，不能领导地质工作。例如一九五六年在省、自治区建立地质局的时候，有些同志认为这样作就会分散了技术力量，会影响地质工作的发展，这显然是忽视党的领导作用的倾向。我们虽曾发动过群众报矿，但缺乏组织措施，没有及早地帮助专区、县逐步建立起地质机构，对报来的矿点检查的少，未能充分发挥群众报矿的作用。
    在地质部门内部工作方法上，也有这种情况，有些同志虽然口头上“赞成”群众路线，但一遇到实际问题时，就往往把我党优良的群众工作方法忘记了，如前中南地质局所属永新队队长为了发动群众，曾采取了与工人群众“同吃、同住、同劳动”的三同方法，有些人竟错误地把这种方法批评为“老一套”，“经验主义”，“农村工作方法”。对工人群众发明创造和先进经验重视不够，很多没有总结与推广，先进单位与落后单位生产效率悬殊很大，几年来出现了若干台月进千公尺以上的先进钻机，但仍有许多月进百公尺的落后钻机。在技术干部使用上“重老轻青”，对青年技术干部的作用估计不足，使用不够放手，把地质工作看得很神秘，似乎非受过高等教育的人就不能插手。由于这种错误思想，在老干部中造成了一种自卑心理，对地质科学望而生畏，不敢大胆地领导地质工作；在技术干部中助长了“技术第一”，“你靠我吃饭”，忽视政治，忽视党的领导作用，只专不红的错误倾向。
    事实完全证明了，要想使地质工作大跃进，必须跳出狭小的天地，依靠各地党委，依靠广大群众。自从在省、自治区建立了地质局以后，由于各级党委加强了对地质工作的领导，特别是自一九五七年以来，由于全民整风运动的伟大推动作用和全国工农业生产大跃进的影响，地质队伍在深入整风的基础上，也出现了生产大跃进的高潮，新的矿区不断发现，生产效率不断提高，定额不断被突破，矿产储量大量增加。几年来最感缺乏的铬矿和镍矿最近也有了很大的好转。江西中部铁矿仅仅经过了三个多月的工作，就肯定了是一个拥有十亿吨以上储量的大铁矿。在海南岛发现了巨大的砂钛铁矿和锆英石矿。月进千公尺的钻机不断出现，四月份更出现了月进两千公尺的钻机，打破了我国钻进效率的最高记录。尤其是在中央和主席提出大、中、小型工业企业建设相结合的方针和中央工业与地方工业同时并举的方针以后，各地对地质工作更加重视，在很多地方已经出现了全党办地质，全民办地质的高潮。有些省已开始在专区、县建立地质机构，抽调了一批干部和学生举办地质训练班进行训练；有些县设置了专职报矿检查员；很多专区、县设置了矿物标本陈列室，有些县委的负责同志亲自带领群众深山探宝。山西大同一个手工业合作社，为了找矿，把一块三百五十公斤重的花岗岩捣碎后，淘洗出重砂送地质部化验，这些动人的事迹，现在已是举不胜举。可以想像，在贯彻了群众路线以后，我国地质工作的面貌将会很快改变。
    破除迷信，体制下放
    怎样实现全党办地质、全民办地质的方针呢？我们认为必须解决以下几个问题：
    （1）彻底破除迷信，打掉地质工作的神秘观点，坚决向忽视党的领导作用、忽视政治的倾向作斗争，保证党对地质工作的绝对领导；在工作方法上发扬党的群众工作传统，贯彻群众路线。
    （2）彻底改变目前地质工作的管理体制，把地质普查勘探力量下放到省、自治区，由省、自治区党委根据需要和现有技术力量，在保证重点的原则下，全面规划统一安排本省地质工作。中央主管部主要负责“全面规划，协作平衡，技术帮助，检查总结”。
    （3）逐步建立专区、县的地质机构，以负担专区和县的小型工业所需要的资源和小型农田水利的水文地质和工程地质工作。建立专、县地质机构所需要的技术力量，除从现在各省的地质、冶金、煤炭三部的地质机构中抽调少数技术人员作为技术骨干外，可以用举办短期速成班的办法来解决。
    （4）大量编印通俗的地质书籍和找矿常识小册子，开展群众性的报矿找矿运动，加强对群众报矿找矿的指导，及时对群众报矿点进行检查评价。
    总之，今后地质工作的基本作法，应该是专业部门与广大群众相结合，普及与提高相结合。
    保证地质工作跃进的另一个关键问题，是必须从教条主义和右倾保守思想束缚下解放出来。
    旧社会遗留下来的地质人员，不少人崇拜英美，脱离实际，为地质而地质，为研究而研究，对勘探生产根本不懂。解放初期，几乎没有可供建设的矿产储量；由党、政、军转业到地质部门来的干部，除了少数几个人过去学过地质，绝大多数完全不懂。几年来，在同志们的努力和苏联专家的帮助下，我们积累了经验，取得了成绩。但是在学习国外先进经验时，还存在着严重的脱离我国实际情况的现象，搬用的规章制度过多，执行过于机械，以致造成人力物力和时间上的很大浪费。
    在双反期间，我们组织了审查旧的规章制度和制订新的规章制度的专门小组，结合部属机关的大鸣大放、大争大辩，修改和制订出适合我国情况的新的规章制度。照这样的做法，就可以用同样的人力和物力，取得加倍的成果。
    我国地质条件是好的，各种矿产资源是十分丰富的。我们相信在党的建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，在党中央、毛主席和各级党委的正确领导下，在全民整风的推动下，只要打破教条主义和右倾保守思想的束缚，冲出狭小的圈子，调动一切积极因素，以气吞山河的决心，高昂的斗志，乘风破浪，在全民大跃进的鼓舞下，我们是能够探明我国社会主义建设所需要的一切矿产资源的。
