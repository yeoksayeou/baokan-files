Anhui, Sichuan, and Henan provinces are focusing on the key to developing local industries: vigorously producing raw materials such as steel, iron, coal, refractory materials, and cement; accelerating the construction of backbone mechanical industries to solve the current difficulties of lacking raw materials and equipment as soon as possible, and preparing for the future development of local industries. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee decided to first increase pig iron production. In addition to accelerating the construction of 102 blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more and striving to put some into production, it mainly relies on indigenous methods of iron smelting. It was decided that the number of small blast furnaces with a volume of 3 cubic meters or less in the province would be increased from the original planned 411 to more than 2,000. After all these blast furnaces are completed, they can produce more than one million tons of indigenous iron annually. Steel production will be increased from the original planned 3,000 tons this year to 20,000 tons. The Anhui Steel Plant, which is currently under construction with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel, will be increased fivefold and developed into an iron and steel complex, striving to produce 1,400 tons of steel this year. The construction of steel plants in Wuhu, Bengbu, Huainan, Tongguanshan and other cities will also be accelerated, striving for the Wuhu and Bengbu steel plants to produce 6,000 tons of steel this year. In terms of cement production, the Provincial Party Committee requires that communes establish low-grade cement plants to achieve self-production and self-use. At present, 214 low-grade cement plants have been built in the province, and each county will also build one or two medium-grade cement plants. Anhui Province is also building machine tool plants, forging and casting plants, water turbine plants, motor manufacturing plants, mining machinery plants, and three general machinery plants, which are decisive for future industrial development.
    In terms of the coal industry, in addition to expanding the Huainan Coal Mine, Anhui Province will also develop the Zhahe Coalfield and build eleven pairs of mine shafts. Thirty-three small coal kilns have also been opened in seventeen counties in southern Anhui.
    Sichuan Province will build more than 500 small blast furnaces for iron smelting this year, striving to achieve a production capacity of 1.21 million tons. The original preliminary production plan for this year has been increased to 600,000 to 670,000 tons. Four medium-sized steel plants with an annual output of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of steel and sixteen small steel plants with an annual output of 6,000 tons of steel will be built in Jiangyou, Chengdu, Leshan and other places. In areas where there are conditions for developing various non-ferrous metals, indigenous methods should be used as much as possible. This year, the province will vigorously develop small coal kilns and use indigenous methods to produce coke, and the original plan to produce 8.3 million tons of coal will be increased to 11.1 million tons.
    As of mid-May, Henan Province had built and put into production more than 164,580 various small factories and mines in more than two months, of which industrial projects such as machinery, steel, fertilizers, coal, electricity, and cement accounted for more than 80%.
    At the Provincial Local Industry Conference convened by the Henan Provincial Party Committee, it was stipulated that industries such as machinery, steel, chemical fertilizers, coal, electricity, and cement should be the focus of development. In order to make these "six horses" take the lead, various places first made arrangements in terms of investment and manpower, and adopted the method of "six horses" leading the overall situation and typical examples leading the entire line, making the development of local industries unstoppable and rapid. For example, after Dengfeng County built the first indigenous blast furnace, it immediately convened a battlefield meeting to promote it, and more than 100 indigenous blast furnaces were built in the county in less than a month. After the experience of farmers in Zhuge Township, Yanshi County, in creating indigenous high-grade cement was promoted in various places, the cement industry flourished throughout the province.

    安徽四川河南抓当前地方工业关键
    加速发展骨干工业
    本报讯　安徽、四川、河南等省，抓发展地方工业的关键：大力生产钢、铁、煤炭、耐火材料、水泥等原材料；加速建设骨干机械工业，尽快解决当前缺乏原材料、设备的困难，为今后地方工业发展作准备。安徽省委决定首先增加生铁产量，除加速建设八立方公尺以上的一百零二个炼铁炉，争取部分投入生产外，主要依靠土法炼铁，决定全省三立方公尺以下的小型炼铁炉由原计划建设四百一十一个增加到二千多个。这些高炉全部建成后，每年可生产土铁一百多万吨。钢的产量则由原计划今年生产三千吨提高到二万吨，正在兴建的年产五万吨钢材的安徽钢厂将加大五倍，发展为钢铁联合企业，争取今年就能生产钢材一千四百吨。在芜湖、蚌埠、淮南、铜官山等市的炼钢厂也要加快建设，争取芜湖、蚌埠钢厂今年生产钢材六千吨。在水泥生产方面，省委要求社社办低标号水泥厂，做到自产自用。目前全省已建成低标号水泥厂二百一十四个，还要县县办一到两个中标号水泥厂。安徽省还正在兴建机床厂、锻铸厂、水轮机厂、电机制造厂、矿山机械厂和三个通用机械厂，这些厂对今后发展工业具有决定性的作用。
    在煤炭工业方面安徽省除扩建淮南煤矿外，还要发展闸河煤田，建设十一对矿井。皖南十七个县也开了三十三个小煤窑。
    四川省今年要建设五百多座炼铁小高炉，争取生产能力达到一百二十一万吨。把原来初步确定今年的生产计划提高到六十到六十七万吨。在江油、成都、乐山等地将建设四个年产十五万吨至二十万吨钢的中型炼钢厂和十六个年产六千吨钢的小型炼钢厂。在有条件发展各种有色金属的地区，要尽量用土办法去搞。今年全省将大力发展小煤窑、搞土法炼焦，要把原订生产八百三十万吨煤的计划，提高到一千一百万吨。
    河南省到5月中旬止，两个多月的时间，建成投入生产的各种小型厂矿有十六万四千五百八十多个，其中机械、钢铁、肥料、煤炭、电力、水泥等工业项目就占80％以上。
    中共河南省委在召开的全省地方工业会议上，曾规定机械、钢铁、化肥、煤炭、电力、水泥等工业为发展的重点。各地为了使这“六马”当先，在投资上、人力上首先作了安排，并且采取了以“六马”带全面，以典型带全线的办法，使地方工业的发展势如破竹，一日千里。如登封县建成第一座土高炉以后，立即召开战地会议推广，不到一个月全县建成土高炉一百多座。偃师县诸葛乡农民创造出的土制高标号水泥的经验在各地推广后，全省水泥工业便遍地开花结果。
