Xinhua News Agency, June 25th. According to TASS, Moscow, June 24th: TASS issued a statement on the U.S. and British ruling circles’ plot to conduct armed intervention in Lebanon’s internal affairs, saying that the Soviet Union advocates maintaining peace in the Middle East region bordering it. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to this foreign-planned intervention in Lebanon, regardless of what is used to disguise such intervention.

The statement said that in view of the threat of Western armed intervention in Lebanon, Soviet officials believe that the attempts by certain countries to conduct armed intervention in Lebanon under this or that pretext are a blatant violation and mockery of the principles of the United Nations. Solving the problems related to the state of Lebanon is the inalienable right of the Lebanese people, and only the Lebanese people.

The statement emphasized that these or those domestic events in Lebanon should not become an excuse for foreign intervention in its internal affairs. The Western countries' attempts to conduct armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs will inevitably lead to a serious intensification of the international situation and will pose a serious threat to the cause of peace. The organizers and participants of the armed intervention must bear full responsibility for this.

The TASS statement exposed the recent activities of the U.S. and British ruling circles in plotting armed intervention in Lebanon’s internal affairs. It pointed out that some people intend to turn the group of United Nations observers sent to Lebanon into a United Nations police force, and some people intend to greatly increase the number of these observers. It seems that a dangerous plan of foreign armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs is brewing. This plan has been openly proposed by the heads of state of the United States and Britain.

The TASS statement said that under the eyes of the whole world, American and British planes are constantly transporting weapons and military supplies to Lebanon. The armies of the United States and Britain are moving towards the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Warships of the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet and British warships, including the aircraft carrier "Royal Ark," have been anchored near the Lebanese coast. U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy also openly threatened to use atomic weapons against the Arab people.

The TASS statement pointed out that well-informed sources in Western countries do not shy away from saying that the above-mentioned war preparations by the United States and Britain are aimed at enabling intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs to be carried out in the shortest possible time, thus confronting the world with a fait accompli.

The TASS statement went on to say that Western newspapers openly pointed out that the main topic of the recent meeting between the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister was to discuss plans for aggression against Lebanon. The U.S. and British governments not only do not deny this, but actually confirm it.

All this shows that the ruling circles of the United States and certain other Western countries intend either to send their troops to Lebanon and occupy the country under the guise of United Nations armed forces, or simply openly. Currently, they are only looking for an excuse to start the intervention.

The statement said that foreign intervention in Lebanon will only once again expose the Western countries' aggressive and expansionist plans against the Arab people. The bombs and cannons of the interveners will not only kill Lebanese citizens, but will also completely destroy the beliefs of those who still harbor illusions that Western countries have good intentions towards the people of the East.

The statement said that the plan for armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs has aroused great indignation not only in Lebanon and Arab countries, but also in many other countries in the East and West. It is the duty of every country and every government that truly cares about peace to do everything possible to prevent aggression against Lebanon. The United Nations, which was established to maintain international security, must not be allowed to be used by enemies of peace in any form to cover up aggression against Lebanon.

### 塔斯社就黎巴嫩局势发表声明  苏联不能漠视美英进行武装干涉  不允许联合国被和平的敌人用来掩护侵略行动

    塔斯社就黎巴嫩局势发表声明
    苏联不能漠视美英进行武装干涉
    不允许联合国被和平的敌人用来掩护侵略行动
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：塔斯社就美英两国统治集团策划武装干涉黎巴嫩内政一事发表声明说，苏联主张在临近它边境的中东地区保持和平，因此，苏联对这次外国策划干涉黎巴嫩一事，不管这种干涉是用什么东西来掩饰的，也不能漠不关心。
    声明说，鉴于西方武装干涉黎巴嫩的威胁，苏联官方人士认为，某些国家在这种或那种借口下想武装干涉黎巴嫩的企图，是粗暴地违背联合国原则的，是对联合国原则的嘲弄。解决有关黎巴嫩国家的问题是黎巴嫩人民，而且只是黎巴嫩人民的不可剥夺的权利。
    声明强调说，黎巴嫩的这些或那些国内事件不应该成为外国干涉它的内政的借口。西方国家武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的企图必然会导致国际局势的严重尖锐化，并且会使和平事业遭到严重的威胁，武装干涉的组织者和参加者要对此负全部责任。
    塔斯社在声明中揭露了美英两国统治集团最近策划武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的活动。它指出，有人打算把派往黎巴嫩的一批联合国观察员变为联合国的警察部队，有人打算大大增加这批观察员的人数。这样看来，外国武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的危险计划正在酝酿中。而这种计划是由美英两国国家领导人公开提出来的。
    塔斯社声明说，在全世界众目睽睽之下，美国和英国的飞机不断向黎巴嫩运送武器和军需品。美英两国的军队在向地中海东岸蠢动。美国海军第六舰队的军舰和英国的军舰，其中包括“皇家方舟号”航空母舰已经停泊在黎巴嫩沿岸附近。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊也公开威胁要用原子武器对付阿拉伯人民。
    塔斯社声明指出，西方国家消息灵通人士并不讳言，美英两国上述种种备战活动，目的在于使干涉黎巴嫩内政的行动能够在最短时间内进行，这样就使世界面临既成事实。
    塔斯社声明接着说，西方国家报刊公开指出不久前美国总统和英国首相会谈的主要题目就是协商侵略黎巴嫩的计划。美英两国政府不仅不否认这一点，而实际上证实了这一点。
    这一切说明，美国和某些其他西方国家统治集团打算或者是在联合国武装部队的幌子下，或者是干脆公开地把自己军队派往黎巴嫩并占领这个国家。目前只是在寻找借口，以便开始干涉。
    声明说，外国干涉黎巴嫩只会再次暴露西方国家对阿拉伯人民的侵略计划和扩张计划。干涉者的炸弹和大炮不仅会杀死黎巴嫩的公民，同时也会彻底摧毁那些仍然幻想西方国家对东方人民抱有善良愿望的人们的信念。
    声明说，武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的计划不仅在黎巴嫩、也不仅在阿拉伯国家引起了极大愤慨，而且在东方和西方许多其他国家也引起了极大的愤慨。真正关心和平的每个国家和每个政府的职责是尽一切可能不允许侵略黎巴嫩。不能允许为维护国际安全而建立的联合国被和平的敌人以某种形式用来对黎巴嫩进行侵略打掩护。
