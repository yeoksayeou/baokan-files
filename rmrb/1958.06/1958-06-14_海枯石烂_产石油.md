"Seas Run Dry and Rocks Crumble" Produce Petroleum
Chang Feng

In ancient times, people knew how to use petroleum that seeped from rock formations, but they couldn't understand the secret of how petroleum formed. They could only regard this natural phenomenon as a gift from the gods.

With the development of science, various theories about the formation of petroleum have emerged. Some say petroleum is transformed from inorganic matter; others say it's transformed from organic matter. Currently, the sapropel theory (formed from a mixture of animals and plants) is considered more accurate and reliable. It explains the secret of petroleum formation as follows:

Rocks on the mountains are eroded over the years and gradually weather. These weathered materials are carried by rivers and streams into the oceans, becoming silt. When marine animals and plants, such as algae, fish, shellfish, and plankton, die, their bodies settle into the silt on the seabed, becoming organic silt. As more and more of this settles, it turns into rock—sedimentary rock.

Seawater and rock formations isolate the organic matter on the seabed from the air, preventing oxidation. In the sediment, there are many bacteria that don't need air. They have a chemical effect, separating the nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus components from the organic matter, highly concentrating the carbon and hydrogen components (petroleum is a hydrocarbon compound). The temperature of the seabed strata hundreds of meters below is relatively high. In the high-pressure and high-temperature strata, organic matter undergoes long-term chemical action and turns into petroleum and natural gas.

Although petroleum is formed, it's dispersed in the rock formations and cannot form oil fields yet. Due to the activity of high-heat magma inside the Earth's crust, the Earth's crust has been constantly rising, falling, squeezed, and compressed over millions of years. Some places gradually rise or fall; some places undergo folding, forming mountains that are convex in the middle and inclined on all sides. In this way, petroleum and water in the oil-bearing strata flow in the gaps of the strata, continuously accumulating in oil storage structures, forming oil fields. But these are not oil fields on the seabed.

The appearance of the Earth's crust is constantly changing, but this change is very slow. Significant changes aren't noticeable over a few decades. It is precisely because the Earth's crust is affected by long-term external and internal forces that "seas will run dry" and "rocks will crumble"; the ocean will become land, and mountains will be leveled into plains.

Since the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic Era, the appearance of the world's continents and the Chinese mainland has gradually approached what it is today. But at that time, the Yangtze River Delta and the North China Plain had not yet formed. According to geologists, 7,400 years ago, the North China Plain was still a vast sea, and Tianjin today was still an ocean 900 years ago. The land of Shanghai emerged from the water about 3,000 years ago, and 5,000 years ago, the area east of Jiangyin was still the sea. The Sichuan Basin, which is now an inland basin, was originally a bay. It has become a basin only after several marine transgressions and regressions and long-term sedimentation.

Places that were once shallow seas, bays, and large lakes in those geological times are most likely to accumulate organic matter and form rich oil fields. Since liberation, geological workers have been searching for underground treasures and have proven that China is a country rich in petroleum resources. From the northern and southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang to northern Shaanxi, rich petroleum resources are continuously buried—the underground oil seas of Karamay, Urho, Qaidam, and Jiuquan basins. Many oil storage structures have been newly discovered in the Sichuan Basin and the North China Plain. After drilling in the Longnüsi and other three oilfield areas in central Sichuan, a large amount of oil began to gush out. Following the Karamay Oilfield, it has become a new oil virgin land of the motherland.

    “海枯石烂”产石油
    长风
    在古代，人们很早就知道利用从岩层溢出来的石油，但对石油形成的秘密却无法了解。人们只好把这种自然现象看作是神的赐予。
    随着科学的发展，产生了各种关于石油形成的学说。有的说：石油是从无机物变成的；有的说：石油是从有机物变成的。目前以腐泥说（动植物混合生成）来得准确可靠。它是这样来解释石油生成的秘密的：
    山岭上的岩石，长年累月的受到侵蚀，逐渐风化了。这些风化物被流水带到江河、海洋中去变成了淤泥。当海洋中的动植物，像藻类、鱼类、蚌蛤和浮游生物等死后，尸体就沉积到海底的淤泥中，成了有机淤泥。越沉积越多，就变成了岩石——沉积岩。
    海水和岩层使海底那些有机体同空气隔离，不再发生氧化作用。在沉积物中，有许多不需要空气的细菌，它们起着化学作用，把有机物中的氮、氧、硫、磷等成分分离开来，使碳、氢成分高度集中，（石油是碳氢化合物）几百公尺以下海底地层的温度比较高。在高压和高温的地层里，有机体经过长期的化学作用，就变成了石油和天然气。
    石油虽然形成了，但是它分散在岩层里，还不能形成油田。由于地壳内部有着高热的岩浆在活动，千百万年来使地壳不断发生升降和挤压运动，有些地方逐渐上升或下降；有些地方发生折皱作用，形成中部凸起四面倾斜的山脉。这样，含油地层中的石油和水分也就在地层空隙中流动，不断在储油构造里积聚，形成了油田。但是这不是海底的油田。
    地壳的面貌不断变化着，只是这种变化很缓慢，几十年间不会显著地看出什么来。正因为地壳在长期的外力和内力作用影响下，“海会枯”，“石会烂”；海洋会变成陆地，山脉会夷成平原。
    从新生代第四纪以后，世界大陆和中国大陆的面貌同今天逐渐接近了。但那时，我国的长江三角洲、华北平原还没有形成。据地质学家考证：在七千四百年以前，华北平原还是一片大海，就是今天的天津在九百年前也还是海洋。上海土地的出水约在三千年前，而在五千年前，江阴以东还是大海。现在的四川盆地，原来也是一个海湾，经过几次海侵和海退作用和长期的沉积作用，才变成了盆地。
    在那些地质时代曾经是浅海、海湾和大湖的地方，最容易沉积有机物质，形成丰富的油田。解放以来，地质工作者在找寻地下富藏中，证明了我国是个石油蕴藏丰富的国家。从新疆天山山脉南北麓起直达陕西北部，绵延地蕴藏着丰富的石油资源——克拉玛依、乌尔禾、柴达木、酒泉盆地等地下油海。在四川盆地，在华北平原等地区新发现了许多储油构造。四川中部龙女寺等三个油田区钻井后开始大量喷油，它已继克拉玛依油田以后，成为祖国新的石油处女地。
