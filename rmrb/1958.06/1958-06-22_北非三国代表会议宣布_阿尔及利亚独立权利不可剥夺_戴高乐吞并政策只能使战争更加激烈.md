Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 21st: Representatives of the governments of Tunisia and Morocco, and the Committee for Coordination and Implementation of the Algerian National Liberation Front, announced yesterday that the sovereignty and right to independence of the Algerian people are inalienable, and this is the only condition for resolving the conflict between France and Algeria.

Moroccan Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ahmed Balafrej, Tunisian Minister of State Bahi Ladgham, and Algerian National Liberation Front leader Ferhat Abbas held a meeting in the Tunisian capital from the 17th to the 20th. A joint communique issued after the meeting reiterated the above-mentioned position of the two governments and the Algerian National Liberation Front on the Algerian issue.

The communique expressed its rejection of the policy of "integrating" Algeria with France, a policy that the De Gaulle government is determined to pursue. The communique pointed out that this policy can only intensify the Algerian war.

At the same time, the communique said that the meeting decided to launch joint diplomatic actions to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue.

The communique expressed satisfaction with the results of the negotiations between Tunisia and France on the withdrawal of French troops stationed in Tunisia and supported Morocco's demand for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Morocco.

After the meeting, it was officially announced that an Arab Maghreb Consultative Council would be established, with Tunisia, Morocco, and the Algerian National Liberation Front each sending ten representatives to participate. Officials also announced that the meeting did not decide to establish an Algerian government in exile.

While representatives of the governments of Tunisia and Morocco and the Algerian National Liberation Front were holding a meeting, Tunisian President Bourguiba and Moroccan Prime Minister Balafrej also held talks. A communique issued after the talks stated that the two countries will continue to consult in order to strengthen cooperation in diplomacy. The two countries will take a common position in international conferences and international organizations and will establish joint diplomatic missions in certain foreign countries. In addition, the two countries will also establish a permanent joint economic committee and a permanent joint cultural and technical committee to promote cooperation in these areas. The two committees will meet in the capitals of Morocco and Tunisia respectively in early July.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 21st: According to TASS, Paris, 20th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, in a statement on the Franco-Tunisian agreement on the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia, accused the French government of "trying to use the agreement signed with Tunisia to plot a political conspiracy in North Africa."

The statement pointed out that the purpose of this practice is to "split the front of North African countries and isolate Algeria."

    北非三国代表会议宣布
    阿尔及利亚独立权利不可剥夺
    戴高乐吞并政策只能使战争更加激烈
    新华社21日讯  突尼斯消息：突尼斯和摩洛哥政府以及阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线统一指导和执行委员会的代表昨天宣布，阿尔及利亚人民的主权和独立权利是不可剥夺的，这是解决法国和阿尔及利亚冲突的唯一条件。
    摩洛哥首相兼外交大臣贝拉弗里杰、突尼斯国务部长伯伊·拉德哈姆和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领导人费尔赫特·阿伯斯，从17日到20日在突尼斯首都举行了会议。会后发表的联合公报重申了两国政府和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线对阿尔及利亚问题的上述立场。
    公报表示拒绝使阿尔及利亚同法国“合为一体”的政策，这种政策是戴高乐政府执意奉行的。公报指出，这种政策只能使阿尔及利亚战争更加激烈。
    同时，公报说，会议决定要展开联合外交行动来使得阿尔及利亚问题得到和平解决。
    公报对突尼斯和法国关于撤出驻突尼斯法军问题谈判的结果表示满意，并且支持摩洛哥关于外国军队撤出摩洛哥的要求。
    会议结束后，官方宣布，将成立阿拉伯马格里布谘询议会，突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线三方面将各派十人参加。官方还宣布，会议没有决定成立阿尔及利亚流亡政府。
    在突尼斯和摩洛哥政府以及阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表举行会议的同时，突尼斯总统布尔吉巴和摩洛哥首相贝拉弗里杰也举行了会谈。会谈后发表的公报说，两国将继续协商，以便加强在外交方面的合作。两国在国际会议和国际组织中将采取共同立场，并且在某些外国建立联合的外交使团。此外，两国还要设立常设联合经济委员会和常设联合文化技术委员会，以促进在这些方面的合作。这两个委员会将在7月初分别在摩洛哥和突尼斯的首都开会。
    据新华社21日讯  据塔斯社巴黎20日讯：突尼斯共产党中央委员会政治局就法国和突尼斯关于法军撤出突尼斯问题的协定发表声明时，指责法国政府“是想利用同突尼斯签订的协议在北非策划政治阴谋”。
    声明指出，这种做法的目的，在于“分裂北非国家的阵线和孤立阿尔及利亚”。
