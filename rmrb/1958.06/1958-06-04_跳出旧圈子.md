　　Breaking Out of the Old Circle
　　Kong Sang
    Today, this newspaper publishes the experiences of the commercial departments of Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, in participating in and organizing production. This opens up a broad path for how commercial work can better promote production and meet needs, and is worth recommending to readers.
    For a long time, comrades in commercial departments have held the idea that "We are in charge of commodity circulation, our function is only to supply raw materials and sell products, and production is the business of the industrial departments, and there is no need for us to participate." Some even believe that commercial participation in production is "meddling in other people's affairs." This view is obviously incomplete.
    Marxist economics believes that in the unified economic activity of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption, production plays a decisive role. Exchange, distribution, and consumption exist and move around production as the basic link. That is to say, production is the foundation of the entire economic life, and the development of production determines the development of commerce and the consumption of the people. However, commerce is not a passive economic factor. It can, in turn, have a huge impact on production and promote the development of production. For example, if commodity production is not sold in stores, it cannot continue to maintain and expand reproduction. Commodity production must be based on commodity exchange as a prerequisite and condition. Commodity production is unimaginable without the exchange process. Furthermore, commerce is better able to understand social needs in a timely and comprehensive manner. By ordering goods from industrial departments accordingly, it can guide production to meet needs. Although comrades in commercial departments subjectively also hope to promote production and meet needs, because they do not have a clear and deep understanding of the above fundamental principles, they cannot correctly apply it at any time in their daily work. Sometimes, they are even influenced by various incorrect ideas (such as purely financial views, local views, departmentalism, etc.), and deviate from the fundamental principle of serving production and promoting production.
    We believe that doing a good job in commodity circulation itself is still the main task of the commercial departments. However, the function of commerce is by no means limited to doing a good job in commodity circulation, but must also participate in and organize production. Because only when production develops can commodity circulation be expanded and can the needs of production and the people be met. In particular, commercial departments currently play a major role in promoting the development of small-scale industries to increase the supply of means of production and means of subsistence. In terms of participating in and organizing production, commercial departments can also closely cooperate with industrial departments to promote advanced production experience, promote the construction methods and operating methods of small-scale industries, organize mutual cooperation between industrial departments, and give full play to production potential. When necessary, they can also run a small number of small factories and mines themselves. Can commercial departments play a major role in this regard? The experience of Fengjie County proves that the key lies in whether they can break out of the old circle of engaging in commodity circulation in isolation.

    今天本报发表的四川奉节县商业部门参与生产、组织生产的经验，为商业工作如何更好地促进生产、满足需要开辟了一条广阔的道路，值得向读者推荐。
    长期以来，商业部门的同志一直存在着这样一种想法：“我们是管商品流通的，我们的职能只是供应原料，卖掉产品，至于生产则是工业部门的事，用不着我们去参与。”甚至有人认为商业参与生产是“不务正业”。这种观点显然是不全面的。
    马克思主义经济学认为：在生产、交换、分配、消费统一的经济活动整体中，起决定作用的是生产。至于交换、分配和消费则是围绕着生产这个基本环节而存在而运动的。也就是说，生产是整个经济生活的根本，生产的发展决定着商业的发展，决定着人民的消费。但是，商业也不是被动的经济因素，它反过来也能给生产以巨大的影响，促进生产的发展。比如，商品生产没有商店出卖，就不能继续维持和扩大再生产，商品生产必须以商品交换为前提和条件，商品生产离开交换过程是不可想像的。再比如，商业比较能够及时全面地了解社会需要，依此向工业部门订货，就可以指导生产适应需要。虽然，商业部门的同志主观上也希望促进生产、满足需要，但由于对上述根本道理认识得不明确、不深刻，因而还不能在日常工作中随时正确地运用它，甚至有时受到了各种不正确思想（例如单纯财政观点、局部观点、本位主义等等）的影响，就离开了为生产服务又促进生产这个根本原则。
    我们认为，做好商品流通本身的工作，仍然是商业部门的主要任务。但是，商业的职能绝不只限于做好商品流通，还必须参与和组织生产。因为只有生产发展了，商品流通才能扩大，才能满足生产和人民的需要。特别是目前商业部门在促进小型工业发展以增加生产资料和生活资料供应上有很大的作用。商业部门在参与生产和组织生产方面，还可以与工业部门密切协作以推广先进的生产经验；推行小型工业的建厂方法和操作方法；组织工业部门之间的互相协作，充分发挥生产潜力。必要的时候，也可以自己办少量的小型厂矿。商业部门能不能在这方面发挥重大作用呢？奉节县的经验证明，关键在于能不能从孤立地搞商品流通的老圈子中跳出来。
