Column: Singing the General Line

　　Facing the motherland's beautiful mountains and rivers,
　　Open your throat and sing mountain songs,
　　If you can't sing, learn to sing,
　　The only thing to fear is not putting in the effort.
　　Mountain song to sing the general line,
　　One person sings, ten thousand harmonize,
　　The general line is like the red sun,
　　Illuminating thousands of mountains and rivers.

    山歌要唱总路线
    雁翼
    面对祖国好山河，
    放开喉咙唱山歌，
    不会唱来学着唱，
    困难就怕功夫多。
    山歌要唱总路线，
    一人唱歌万人和，
    总路线似红太阳，
    照亮千山万条河。
