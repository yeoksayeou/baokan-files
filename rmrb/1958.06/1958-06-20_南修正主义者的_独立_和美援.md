The South Revisionists' "Independence" and US Aid
Li He

For a long time, the Yugoslav revisionists have been posing as so-called "non-aligned," boasting that they are "pursuing an independent policy." What is the essence of their flaunted "non-aligned" "independence"? J.C. Grew, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, answered this question in a speech in March of this year. He said that the United States' "economic assistance to Yugoslavia in recent years of $650 million, plus a secret amount of military assistance, has helped Yugoslavia maintain its independent position." He did not disclose the full amount of US aid, but he revealed the marriage between US aid and the so-called "non-aligned" "independence" of the Yugoslav revisionists. The Yugoslav revisionists expressed all kinds of gratitude for US aid, but they avoided mentioning this marriage, while Americans generally knew it. Joseph Alsop, editor of the Washington "Saturday Evening Post," also said in his recent dispatch: "The United States has invested nearly $1.5 billion in Tito's independence to date: about $700 million in economic aid, plus $780 million in military aid."

The Yugoslav revisionists are afraid of revealing the secrets of their "non-alignment," and they conceal the fact by saying that US aid to Yugoslavia only accounts for 4% of Yugoslavia's national income, but they avoid mentioning the huge proportion of US aid in Yugoslavia's national budget. Let us look at the facts.

The US aid accepted by the Yugoslav leadership group includes both economic and military aid. US officials generally acknowledge $1.5 billion; as US Senator Knowland also said in March of this year, the United States has given the Tito government nearly $1.5 billion in aid. In fact, it is more than this. According to materials from Yugoslav newspapers, the economic assistance given by the United States, from 1950 to 1957, was more than $1 billion. If calculated from 1945, it has reached more than $1.7 billion:

	1945—1950　$294 million
	1950—1951　$94 million
	1951—1952　$78 million
	1952—1953　$124 million
	1953—1954　$65 million
	1954—1955　$121 million
	1955—1956　$100 million
	1956—1957　$120.8 million
	Given in the name of UNRRA after the war　$420 million
	Loans from the US Export-Import Bank before 1954　$55 million
	Long-term loans from the International Development Bank before 1954　$12 million
	Short-term loans from the International Development Bank before 1954　$11 million
In addition, the Associated Press reported in December 1957 that "since 1950, the value of US military aid to Yugoslavia has reached more than $1 billion." Therefore, even if we do not count the economic assistance obtained from other capitalist countries, the Yugoslav leadership group has accepted more than $2.7 billion from the United States in twelve years, which is an average of $225 million per year, or 67.5 billion dinars (one US dollar is equivalent to 300 Yugoslav dinars). The annual income and expenditure of Yugoslavia's budget is only about 200 billion dinars (for example, from 1952 to 1956, Yugoslavia's fiscal revenue was 217 billion, 189 billion, 256 billion, 190 billion, and 212.5 billion dinars respectively). Therefore, if we look at the proportion of US aid in Yugoslavia's national budget, the average annual US aid is equivalent to one-third of Yugoslavia's annual fiscal revenue! Is this as insignificant as the Yugoslav revisionists say, and does it not determine their "attitude on policy and ideological issues"? Is it an exaggeration to say that the Yugoslav leadership group headed by Tito is not only supported by the people of their own country, but also by a large amount of US aid?

The Yugoslav revisionists have also put forward arguments for their acceptance of US aid. Just as they are accustomed to blaming all sins on the socialist camp and the communist parties of various countries, they explain that borrowing so much US debt is also due to the fact that socialist countries in the past damaged economic relations with Yugoslavia. However, just as the Yugoslav leadership group still adopted a so-called "non-aligned" attitude after the socialist camp and the communist parties of various countries took the initiative to improve relations with Yugoslavia, it can be seen from the above table that the Yugoslav leadership group did not borrow less US debt after the socialist countries restored economic relations with Yugoslavia, although after the improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, Yugoslavia received loans, compensation, and debt relief from the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries amounting to $639 million.

Lenin's opinions on the possibility of socialist countries using foreign investment have also been cited by the Yugoslav revisionists to defend their relationship with US aid. What a shameless distortion of Leninism! What is the position of the Yugoslav leadership group in exchanging US aid by systematically distorting the principles of Marxism-Leninism, viciously attacking the socialist camp and the communist parties of various countries, allowing the flood of US surplus materials in the Yugoslav market, and condoning the "American way of life" to corrupt the Yugoslav people? Can this be said to be "utilizing foreign investment"?

More than $2.7 billion, more than 810 billion dinars, this is the price for the Yugoslav leadership group headed by Tito to formulate a thorough revisionist program and completely abandon the socialist road. This fact itself shows that it is not Yugoslavia that has utilized US capital, but US capital that has utilized Yugoslavia. However, blinded by profit, the Tito group is unwilling to face this reality squarely. In the course of nearly ten years, the Tito group sometimes created some troubles with the imperialist camp in order to raise its status; sometimes it pretended to lean towards the socialist camp in order to maintain the guise of communism; but, generally speaking, they considered it advantageous to lean towards the imperialist camp. In the course of nearly ten years, US aid and its attached conditions tightly and loosely controlled and swayed the "independence" of the Tito group. Whenever the US imperialists paid a large sum of aid, the Tito group always made some indication; whenever the Tito group made some achievements in attacking the socialist camp and splitting the international communist movement, the US imperialists always gave a bonus.

Despite how much the Yugoslav revisionists are appreciated by the US imperialists, US aid is not as unconditional as the Tito clique praises. For example, the US Emergency Relief Act for Yugoslavia passed by the US Congress in 1950 stipulated that "the Yugoslav government must help American broadcasting, newspapers and other propaganda tools to carry out propaganda to the Yugoslav people"; "The US government may send personnel to supervise the distribution of the materials in Yugoslavia, the actions of these personnel are completely unrestricted, and they should be given convenient conditions for transportation, communication, etc." The US-Yugoslav economic cooperation agreement signed in 1952 stipulated that Yugoslavia must establish "the closest possible economic ties" with Western countries to strengthen its own "independence," "further realize basic human rights, freedom and democratic structure," and "strengthen joint security and individual and collective defense against aggression." In this way, is it not more in line with the facts that Tito's emphasis on the foundation of US-Yugoslav relations at the Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia—mutual respect, equal cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs—can only be explained unilaterally, that is, only Yugoslavia treats the United States in this way, and the United States does not treat Yugoslavia in this way?

Despite how the Yugoslav revisionists usually pretend to stand aloof from the two camps, they still take off their white gloves and serve the imperialist camp at critical moments. For example, when the imperialist camp needed a Balkan treaty to link up with the Atlantic Treaty, the Yugoslav leadership group signed a five-year "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation" with Greece and Turkey in February 1953, which stipulated that the three countries should cooperate with each other in military and diplomatic affairs. One month before the signing of this treaty, the Tito group received $119 million in aid from the United States, Britain, and France; two months later, it received another $11 million from the United States. On the basis of this treaty, the foreign ministers of the three countries signed a twenty-year alliance treaty in August 1954. This military alliance treaty was signed after the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries began to restore normal relations with Yugoslavia. During the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion in 1956, the Tito group played the role of a provocateur and interventionist that everyone knows; Tito himself also used the Pula speech, which won applause from the imperialists, to embolden the anti-Soviet and anti-communist clouds that the imperialists were blowing up at the time. Before and after Tito's speech, in November and December, the Tito group received two bonuses from the United States: $98.3 million and about 6 billion dinars. In November 1957, when the meeting and declaration signed by the representatives of the communist and workers' parties in Moscow marked a new peak in the development of the international communist movement, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party refused to sign the declaration of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries. The Tito group's stance of maintaining "independence" not only in state relations but also in party relations immediately earned the United States a huge loan and signed an agreement for US surplus agricultural products worth $62.5 million.

This is how the Yugoslav revisionists have long placed their hopes on US aid. Their eagerness to formulate such a notorious program this time, completely exposing their revisionist position, and becoming enemies with communist parties all over the world, is nothing more than wanting to get more US aid. An article written by Robert Allen published in the "New York Post" on May 22 revealed this trend. The article said: "Marshal Tito now wants to get more economic and military assistance from the United States. Cautious inquiries are now being made through diplomatic channels regarding this matter. If our government is willing to accept it, Belgrade will begin to make a formal request. Whether in the State Department or in the Pentagon, the existing signs indicate that they are in favor of providing some further assistance. ... The foreign aid bill under consideration includes two sums of money for Yugoslavia: one is about $50 million in 'special economic assistance,' and the other is $1.6 million in technical assistance. ... Tito hopes to be able to obtain a long-term loan of $300 million for the purchase of heavy machinery and other industrial equipment in the United States and Eurasia, and hopes to be allowed to purchase 'a certain amount' of American arms, especially the parts needed for the American military equipment that has been delivered to Yugoslavia."

On the balance of the Yugoslav revisionists, US aid is much heavier than the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the morality of communists. They spare no effort to seize US aid, regardless of the situation that Yugoslavia now has to use more than 25% of its export earnings to repay foreign debt every year. But their "non-aligned" posture cannot be maintained, the additional conditions of US aid will become more stringent, and their "independent" policy will seem even more purely self-satirical.

    南修正主义者的“独立”和美援
    李何
    南斯拉夫修正主义者好久以来就摆着所谓“超阵营”的姿态，自吹自擂地说它是“实行独立政策”。他们所眩耀的“超阵营”的“独立”，实质上是什么东西呢？美国负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿帮办詹德雷在今年3月间的谈话，回答了这个问题。他说：美国“最近几年给予南斯拉夫的六亿五千万美元的经济援助，加上一笔数目秘密的军事援助，已经帮助南斯拉夫保持了独立的地位”。他没有公开美援的全部数目，但是他一语道破了美援和南斯拉夫修正主义者所谓“超阵营”的“独立”之间的姻缘。南斯拉夫修正主义者对美援表示了百般感恩戴德，但是他们讳言这一段姻缘，而美国人普遍知道它。华盛顿“星期六晚邮报”编辑豪塞尔在他的最近一篇通讯中也说：“美国到现在为止，对铁托的独立，投资了将近十五亿美元：约七亿美元的经济援助，加上七亿八千万美元的军事援助。”
    南斯拉夫修正主义者怕泄露“超阵营”的隐秘，他们掩饰说，美国对南斯拉夫的援助只等于南斯拉夫国民收入的4％，但对于美援在南斯拉夫国家预算中所占的巨大的比重，却避而不提。让我们看看事实吧。
    南斯拉夫领导集团所接受的美国援助，包括经济和军事两部分，美国官方一般承认有十五亿美元；如美国议员诺兰今年3月也说过，美国已经给予铁托政府将近十五亿美元的援助。其实，不止此数。根据南斯拉夫报刊的材料，美国所给的经济援助，从1950年到1957年，就在十亿美元以上，如果从1945年算起，已经达到十七亿多美元：
        1945年—1950年　29400万美元
        1950年—1951年　9400万美元
        1951年—1952年　7800万美元
        1952年—1953年　12400万美元
        1953年—1954年　6500万美元
        1954年—1955年　12100万美元
        1955年—1956年　10000万美元
        1956年—1957年　12080万美元
        战后以联合国善后救济总署名义给的　42000万美元
        1954年以前美国进出口银行贷款　5500万美元
        1954年以前国际开发银行长期贷款　12000万美元
        1954年以前国际开发银行短期贷款　11000万美元此外，美联社1957年12月报道，“从1950年以来，美国供给南斯拉夫的军事援助的价值已达十亿美元以上”。因此，纵使不算从其他资本主义国家手中取得的经济援助，南斯拉夫领导集团在十二年中从美国那里就接受了二十七亿多美元，即每年两亿两千五百万美元，也就是六百七十五亿狄纳尔（一美元折南币三百狄纳尔）。而南斯拉夫预算的每年收入与支出不过两千亿狄纳尔左右（例如：从1952到1956年，南斯拉夫的财政收入分别为2170；1890；2560；1900；2125亿狄纳尔）。所以，如果从美援在南斯拉夫国家预算中所占的比重来看，每年美援平均等于南斯拉夫国家每年财政收入的三分之一！这难道像南斯拉夫修正主义者所说的那样不足轻重，不能决定他们“在政策和意识形态问题上的态度”吗？以铁托为首的南斯拉夫领导集团不仅靠本国人民养活，而且靠大量的美援养活，这难道说得过份吗？
    南斯拉夫修正主义者还引出了他们接受美援的论据。正如他们惯于把一切罪过推到社会主义阵营和各国共产党身上去一样，他们解释借那么多美债也是由于社会主义各国过去弄坏了对南斯拉夫的经济关系。然而，正如在社会主义阵营和各国共产党主动地改善了对南斯拉夫的关系以后，南斯拉夫领导集团仍然采取所谓“超阵营”的态度一样，从上表可以看出，在社会主义各国恢复了对南斯拉夫的经济关系以后，南斯拉夫领导集团也没有少借美债，虽然在苏南关系改善以后，南斯拉夫从苏联和东欧社会主义各国获得的贷款、补偿和免去的债务就达到了六亿三千九百万美元。
    列宁探讨社会主义国家利用外国投资的可能性的意见，也被南斯拉夫修正主义者引用来辩护他们和美援的关系。这是多么无耻地对于列宁主义的歪曲啊！南斯拉夫领导集团以系统地歪曲马克思列宁主义原则，以恶毒地攻击社会主义阵营和各国共产党，以允许美国剩余物资泛滥南斯拉夫市场，以纵容“美国生活方式”腐蚀南斯拉夫人民，来换取美国的援助，这是什么立场呢？这能够说是“利用外国投资”吗？
    二十七亿多美元，八千一百多亿狄纳尔，这就是以铁托为首的南斯拉夫领导集团制定出彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，完完全全抛弃了社会主义道路的代价。这个事实本身就说明了，不是南斯拉夫利用了美国资本，而是美国资本利用了南斯拉夫。然而，利令智昏，铁托集团是不愿意正视这个现实的。在将近十年过程中，铁托集团有时为了提高身价，向帝国主义阵营闹点蹩扭；有时为了维持共产主义的幌子，向社会主义阵营故作靠拢之状；但是，总的说来，他们是以倒向帝国主义阵营为得计的。在将近十年过程中，美援和它的附加条件时紧时松地控制和左右着铁托集团的“独立”。每当美帝国主义者付出一笔较大的援助之前，铁托集团总是有所表示；每当铁托集团在攻击社会主义阵营和分裂国际共产主义运动方面有所作为之后，美帝国主义者总是给予一笔奖金。
    尽管南斯拉夫修正主义者怎样受美帝国主义者赏识，美援并不像铁托之流所称赞的那样没有附加的条件。例如：1950年美国国会通过的对南斯拉夫紧急救济法案中规定：“南斯拉夫政府必须帮助美国的广播、报纸等宣传工具向南斯拉夫人民进行宣传”；“美国政府得派遣人员在南斯拉夫对该项物资的分配进行监督，这些人员的行动完全不受限制，并应给予交通、通信等方便条件”。1952年签订的美南经济合作协定中规定：南斯拉夫必须同西方国家建立“尽可能密切的经济联系”，以加强它本国的“独立”，“进一步实现基本人权、自由和民主结构”，“加强共同安全和反对侵略的个别和集体的防务”。这样看来，铁托在南共代表大会上所强调的美南关系的基础——相互尊重、平等合作和互不干涉内政——只能作单面的解释，即只有南斯拉夫如此对待美国，而美国并不如此对待南斯拉夫，不是更符合事实吗？
    尽管南斯拉夫修正主义者平时怎样装模作样地超然站在两个阵营之外，他们一到重要关头还是脱下一双白手套为帝国主义阵营效劳的。例如：当帝国主义阵营需要一个巴尔干条约来与大西洋公约挂钩的时候，南斯拉夫领导集团在1953年2月与希腊、土耳其签订了为期五年的“友好与合作条约”，这个条约规定这三个国家在军事和外交上的互相配合。在这条约签订之前一个月，铁托集团从美英法得到了一亿一千九百万美元的援助；之后两个月，又从美国得到了一千一百万美元。在这个条约的基础上，这三个国家的外长在1954年8月又签订了二十年同盟条约，这个军事同盟条约是在苏联和东欧社会主义国家同南斯拉夫开始恢复正常关系之后签订的。在1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱事件时期，铁托集团扮演了大家都知道的挑拨者和干涉者的角色；铁托本人还以博得帝国主义者掌声的普拉演说，为帝国主义者当时所吹起的反苏反共乌云助威。在铁托演说的前后，在11月和12月，铁托集团从美国那里得到了九千八百三十万美元和约六十亿狄纳尔的两笔奖金。在1957年11月，当各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行的会议和签署的宣言，标志着国际共产主义运动发展的新高峰的时候，南共领导人拒绝在社会主义国家的共产党和工人党宣言上签字。铁托集团这种不但在国家关系而且在党的关系上保持“独立”的姿态，立即换得了美国一笔巨额贷款，签订了价值六千二百五十万美元的美国剩余农业品的协定。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者就是这样长期把希望寄托在美援上面。他们这次急于制定那样臭名远扬的纲领，彻底暴露自己的修正主义立场，同全世界共产党为敌，无非想多得到一批美援。“纽约邮报”5月22日发表的一篇罗伯特·艾伦写的文章，透露了这个苗头。文章说：“铁托元帅现在想从美国得到更多的经济军事援助。关于这件事情，现在正在通过外交途径进行谨慎的探询。如果我国政府有接受之意，贝尔格莱德将开始提出正式要求。无论是在国务院还是在五角大楼，现有的迹象都说明它们是赞成进一步给予一些援助的。……正在审议中的援外法案中包括两笔给南斯拉夫的款子：一笔是大约五千万美元的‘特别经济援助’，另一笔是一百六十万美元的技术援助。……铁托希望能够得到一笔三亿美元的长期贷款，供在美国和欧亚购买重型机械和其他工业设备使用，并且希望能够许可购买‘一定数量’的美国军火，特别是已经交给南斯拉夫的美国军事装备所需要的零件。”
    在南斯拉夫修正主义者的天平上，美援要比马克思列宁主义的原则和共产主义者的道义重得多。他们不顾南斯拉夫现在每年已经要用出口收益的25％以上偿还外债的处境，不择手段地攫取美援。但是他们的“超阵营”的姿态摆不成了，美援的附加条件将会更加苛刻起来，他们的“独立”政策将更显得是纯粹的自我讽刺。
