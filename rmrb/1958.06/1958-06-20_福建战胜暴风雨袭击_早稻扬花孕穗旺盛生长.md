    Fujian Overcomes Rainstorm Attacks
    Early Rice Flowering and Heading Grows Vigorously
    Fuzhou, June 19th (Reported by our correspondent Xu Xiao) The people of Fujian Province, with their soaring enthusiasm for striving for a bumper harvest, have overcome the continuous attacks of rainstorms, ensuring the vigorous continued growth of early rice with a bumper harvest in sight. At present, except for a small portion of early rice in the southern region that has matured and is being harvested, the vast majority of early rice in Fujian is heading, flowering, and pregnant with ears, presenting a scene of unprecedented bumper harvest everywhere.
    From the 14th to the 16th, sudden rainstorms struck various parts of Fujian, with rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters in many areas. The people of Fujian Province, with the spirit of "man will conquer nature," concentrated all their efforts to drain water and fight floods in the rain, rushing to harvest mature early rice and rescue fallen rice. The Longxi Special District organized 1.2 million troops to quickly harvest the mature early rice in the rain. When rescuing fallen early rice, every household contributed bamboo poles, and everyone twisted straw ropes. Everyone braved the rain to insert countless bamboo poles into the fields, pull up straw ropes, and block the rice. The 100,000-strong army of the Minhou County Committee of the Communist Party of China braved the rain to rescue and support more than 10,000 mu of fallen early rice in the county in a timely manner. When the rainstorm struck, tens of thousands of people guarded the dikes along the rivers and coasts day and night. They rescued the dangerous spots and blocked the floods in time. The local garrison also actively participated in the fight against floods and the prevention of lodging. Before this rainstorm, various parts of Fujian actively strengthened field management to prevent early rice from lodging and intensified the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. Nanning County agricultural cooperatives generally adopted the advanced experience of "less sun for high fields, more sun for low fields, hard sun for fertile fields, and white sun for lean fields," ensuring that basically no lodging occurred in the county's 100,000 mu of early rice.
    Since the 17th, the weather has cleared up in various places. Farmers are continuing to strengthen early rice field management. Farmers in various places loudly shouted, "The battle will not be relaxed until the grain enters the barn." While ensuring a bumper harvest of early rice, the broad masses of farmers are also paying attention to continuing the rush to accumulate fertilizer and other work, striving for a bumper harvest of late rice in the autumn.

    福建战胜暴风雨袭击
    早稻扬花孕穗旺盛生长
    本报福州19日电　记者徐晓报道：福建全省人民争取大丰收的冲天干劲，战胜了暴风雨的连日袭击，确保丰收在望的早稻旺盛地继续生长。目前，福建除了南部地区有少部分早稻已经成熟开镰收割以外，绝大部分地区的早稻正在吐穗、扬花和孕穗，到处是一片空前大丰收的景象。
    从14日到16日，福建各地突降暴风雨，许多地区暴雨量在一百公厘以上。福建全省人民以人定胜天的气概，集中全力冒雨排水抗洪，抢收成熟的早稻和抢救倒伏的稻禾。龙溪专区组织一百二十万大军冒雨迅速抢收起已成熟的早稻。在抢救倒伏早稻时，家家献竹杆，人人搓草绳。大家冒雨把无数条竹杆插在田里，拉起草绳，拦住稻禾。中共闽侯县十万大军冒雨及时把全县一万多亩倒伏的早稻救扶起来。暴风雨来袭时，在沿江和沿海地区的堤坝上，有成千上万的人在日夜守护。他们及时抢救了险处，堵住了洪水。当地驻军也积极参加了抗洪和防倒伏的斗争。在这次暴雨袭击以前，福建各地就积极加强田间管理，防止早稻倒伏，加紧防治病虫害等。南平县各农业社普遍采用“高田少晒，低田多晒，肥田晒硬，瘦田晒白”的先进经验，保证了全县十万亩早稻基本上没有倒伏。
    17日以来，各地都已转晴。农民们正在继续加强早稻田间管理工作，各地农民响亮地喊出：“谷子未进仓，战斗不放松”。广大农民在确保早稻大丰收的斗争的同时，还注意继续突击积肥等工作，力争秋季晚稻大丰收。
