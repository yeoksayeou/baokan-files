Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The Beijing on-site Vegetable Work Conference jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Second Ministry of Commerce concluded on the 11th. The conference put forward some new problems that have emerged in the current vegetable production and supply work, and summarized several basic experiences for doing a good job in vegetable production and supply.

The meeting held that the overall vegetable production and sales situation this year is good. At present, the national vegetable planting area is about 40 million mu, second only to cotton and ranking second among cash crops. The main problem at present is that the vegetable supply in small cities and emerging industrial and mining areas is relatively tight. The leadership in these areas has not paid enough attention to the development of vegetable production, and the principle of "local production, local supply" has not been well implemented. The meeting believes that in the new situation of the whole people running industry, the population of small cities will greatly increase, and new industrial and mining areas will continue to emerge; at the same time, with the basic change of the rural landscape in three years of hard work, the vast number of farmers will also improve their lives and demand more vegetables. Therefore, in the future, in addition to continuing to pay attention to the vegetable production of large and medium-sized cities and ensuring supply, we should pay more attention to the vegetable production and supply work of small cities and emerging industrial and mining areas, and should begin to pay attention to leading the vegetable production work in rural, pastoral and minority areas. In short, we must face 600 million people and comprehensively solve the vegetable problem.

In order to solve the current problem of vegetable shortage in small cities and emerging industrial and mining areas, the meeting required that each region should quickly understand the development of local emerging projects, and according to needs, establish vegetable production bases in the local or nearby areas, arrange sufficient production areas, and do a good job in transportation, storage and other work; at the same time, regions with vegetables are required to vigorously support regions lacking vegetables. In the vast rural areas, intercropping and interplanting of vegetables and grains should be promoted to develop vegetable production.

After exchanging experiences from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Harbin and other places and visiting some vegetable production units in Beijing, the meeting believes that the following are the basic experiences for doing a good job in vegetable production and supply: First, it is necessary to sow enough area of vegetables, and at the same time do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area and the quality of vegetables. The meeting believes that while developing the area of vegetable production, it is also necessary to do everything possible to increase yield and quality. It seems that the potential for increasing the yield per unit area of vegetables is very large. For example, the Chinese cabbage in Gushi County, Henan Province, introduced at this meeting, has a yield of 75,000 jin per mu, while the Northeast region only produces 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, and the yield is extremely unbalanced. The meeting summarized a complete set of experience in developing vegetable production, which can be summarized in ten characters: "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, intercropping, drainage, prevention, chemistry, storage", that is, water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer application, soil improvement, selection and promotion of improved varieties, rational close planting, intercropping, drainage sowing, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, mechanization and electrification, and doing a good job in vegetable storage.

The second basic experience is to eliminate the contradiction between peak and off-season, and ensure that cities get a relatively balanced supply of vegetables. In the past, commercial staff engaged in vegetables were "afraid of the peak season and worried about the off-season". In the peak season, there were too many vegetables and they were afraid of rotting, and in the off-season, there were too few vegetables and they were worried about insufficient supply. The meeting believes that the experience of Beijing and other cities in solving the contradiction between peak and off-season is worth promoting nationwide. These cities have adopted measures such as "staggered sowing, staggered marketing" and "increased planting of quick-maturing vegetables" in vegetable production, so that some vegetables are marketed earlier and some vegetables are marketed later, avoiding excessive concentration of marketing volume in the peak season; at the same time, the production and storage of autumn vegetables has been increased to ensure the supply in the off-season.

The third basic experience is that it is necessary to strengthen close cooperation between production and sales. The key to doing a good job in cooperation is: the commercial department must take over all the vegetables produced by the agricultural cooperatives and ensure that producers have reasonable income; and provide support for the difficulties in the production of the agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives should also produce according to needs, and deliver goods whenever needed.

This meeting started on June 5th, with more than 290 relevant personnel from all over the country participating.

    解决蔬菜问题要面向六亿人民
    蔬菜工作会议提出当前生产供应中的问题和经验
    据新华社14日讯　农业部和第二商业部联合召开的蔬菜工作北京现场会议11日结束。会议提出了当前蔬菜生产和供应工作中出现的一些新问题，总结出做好蔬菜生产和供应工作的几条基本经验。
    会议认为今年蔬菜产销情况总的说来是良好的。目前全国蔬菜种植面积约有四千万亩，仅次于棉花而居于经济作物的第二位，目前的主要问题是小城市、新兴的工矿区蔬菜供应比较紧张，这些地区的领导方面对发展蔬菜生产还注意不够，“就近生产、就近供应”的方针没有很好地贯彻。会议认为在全民办工业的新形势下，小城市人口会大大增加，新兴的工矿区也会不断出现；同时在苦战三年基本改变农村面貌的情况下，广大农民也要改善生活，要求多吃蔬菜。因此今后除继续注意大中城市的蔬菜生产并保证供应以外，要更多地注意小城市和新兴工矿区的蔬菜生产和供应工作，并且要开始注意领导农村和牧区、少数民族地区的蔬菜生产工作。总之要面向六亿人民，全面解决蔬菜问题。
    为了解决小城市和新兴工矿区目前的缺菜问题，会议要求每个地区都应该迅速了解当地新兴工程的发展情况，根据需要，在当地或附近地区建立蔬菜生产基地，安排足够的生产面积，并做好运输、贮存等各项工作；同时要求有菜的地区大力支援缺菜地区。在广大农村应当提倡蔬菜和粮食间作套种，以发展蔬菜生产。
    会议在交流了北京、上海、成都、哈尔滨等地的经验并在北京参观了一些蔬菜生产单位以后，认为做好蔬菜生产、供应工作有以下几条基本经验：第一，必须播种足够面积的蔬菜，同时千方百计地提高单位面积产量和蔬菜的质量。会议认为在发展蔬菜生产面积的同时，也要想尽一切办法提高产量和质量。现在看来提高蔬菜单位面积产量的潜力是很大的。如这次会议上介绍的河南固始县大白菜每亩产量达到七万五千斤，而东北地区每亩只产三、四千斤，产量极不平衡。会议总结了发展蔬菜生产的一套完整的经验，这些经验概括起来有十个字：“水、肥、土、种、密、套、排、防、化、贮”，也就是兴修水利，增施肥料，改良土壤，选育和推广良种，合理密植，实行套种，排开播种，防治病虫害，机械化电气化，做好蔬菜贮藏。
    第二条基本经验是消灭淡旺季的矛盾，保证城市蔬菜比较均衡地得到供应。过去经营蔬菜的商业工作人员是“怕旺季，愁淡季”，旺季菜多了怕烂掉，淡季菜少了又愁供应不足。会议认为北京等城市解决淡旺季矛盾的经验值得向全国推广。这些城市在蔬菜生产上采取“排开播种，分期上市”、“增种快熟菜”等措施，使一部分蔬菜提前上市，一部分蔬菜推迟了上市的时间，避免旺季上市量过分集中；同时又增加了秋菜的生产和储存，以保证淡季的供应。
    第三条基本经验是必须加强产销双方的密切协作。搞好协作的关键是：商业部门必须对农业社生产出来的蔬菜全部包下来，并保证生产者有合理的收入；对于农业社生产上的困难要给予支援。农业社也要按照需要进行生产，做到什么时候需要，什么时候送货。
    这次会议是6月5日开始举行的，参加会议的有全国有关人员共二百九十多人。
