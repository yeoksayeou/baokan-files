Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, Sydney Dispatch: The Australian Communist Party's organ "Forum" Weekly recently published an editorial on Tito's speech in Labin, pointing out that Tito has proven by his own words and actions that he is betraying the socialist cause.

"Forum" Weekly said that Tito's recent speech in Labin thoroughly proves that the title of Judas bestowed upon him by the Chinese Communist Party is correct.

The editorial refuted Tito's claim that the aid given by the United States was economic and not attached to any conditions. The editorial also pointed out that Tito's mention in his speech of the so-called "aid" that the United States gave to the Soviet Union after interfering in the Soviet war was a fabrication of history. The editorial said that the United States and other imperialist troops had caused incalculable losses in the Soviet Union and helped kill many Soviet people. The editorial pointed out that the subsequent "food relief" from the United States was intended for extortion.

The editorial concluded, "Tito's attempt to portray himself as a victim of a smear campaign to deceive the people is futile. His own words and actions clearly show where he stands in the world-scale struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war."

    澳共“论坛”周报的社论认为
    把铁托叫做犹大是对的
    他的言行证明他是在出卖社会主义事业
    新华社26日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛”周报最近就铁托在拉宾的演说发表的社论指出，铁托以他自己的言论和行动证明他是在出卖社会主义事业。
    “论坛”周报说，铁托最近在拉宾的演说彻底证明中国共产党赠给他的犹大的称号是对的。
    社论驳斥了铁托关于美国给予的援助是经济性的而没有附带任何条件的说法。社论还指出，铁托在演说中提到美国在干涉苏联的战争以后曾经给予苏联所谓“援助”这是在伪造历史。社论说，美国和其他帝国主义军队曾经在苏联造成价值难以数计的损失，并且协助杀死了许多苏联人民。社论指出，随后美国给予“粮食救济”的目的是在进行敲诈。
    社论最后说，“铁托企图把自己说成是诽谤运动的牺牲品来蒙蔽人民，这是徒劳无益的。他自己的言论和行动正表明他在和平势力和战争势力的世界规模的斗争中站在什么地方。”
