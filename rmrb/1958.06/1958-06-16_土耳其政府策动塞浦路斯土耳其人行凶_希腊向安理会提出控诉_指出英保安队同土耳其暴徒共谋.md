    Xinhua News Agency: The Greek representative to the United Nations, Palamas, lodged a complaint with the United Nations Security Council on the 13th, accusing the Turkish government of instigating Turkish thugs on the island of Cyprus to attack Greek residents on the island.
    In a letter to the Security Council, Palamas pointed out that the Turkish government instigated these riots to realize its conspiracy to partition Cyprus. To this end, while the Turkish government instigated thugs to attack Greek residents, its senior officials repeatedly threatened to "send Turkish troops for direct intervention."
    Palamas said in the letter: "It is reported that there is collusion between the British security forces and Turkish attackers." He pointed out that the British authorities were slow to intervene and take full action to stop the attacks by Turkish thugs.
    According to newspapers, the meeting of the Permanent Representatives Council of the North Atlantic Group currently being held in Paris is pressuring Greece to accept the British government's plan for resolving the Cyprus issue, which is about to be announced to Parliament. According to "Le Monde," the Greek government intends to reject this plan.
    In Cyprus, Turkish thugs continue to run rampant. Another Greek resident was killed on the night of the 14th.
    Greek Foreign Minister Averoff protested to the British government on the 14th against the British colonial authorities' connivance with Turkish thugs in killing Greek residents.
    Meanwhile, all Greek personnel and their families, about 200 people, working at the Southeast Europe Headquarters of the North Atlantic Group in Izmir (Turkey) have left Turkey by plane on the 14th and returned to Greece.
    On the other hand, Turkey continues to demand the "partition" of Cyprus. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Turkish government emphasized that Turkish residents on the island of Cyprus and Greek residents "cannot coexist under one regime." The Turkish authorities have also been continuously organizing mass rallies to incite opposition to Greece in recent days.

    土耳其政府策动塞浦路斯土耳其人行凶
    希腊向安理会提出控诉
    指出英保安队同土耳其暴徒共谋
    据新华社讯　希腊驻联合国代表帕拉马斯13日向联合国安全理事会控诉土耳其政府策动塞浦路斯岛上的土耳其暴徒袭击这个岛上的希腊居民的暴行。
    帕拉马斯在给安理会的信中指出，土耳其政府策动这种暴乱是为了实现它的分割塞浦路斯的阴谋。为了这个目的，土耳其政府在策动暴徒袭击希腊居民的同时，它的高级官员还一再扬言将“出动土耳其军队进行直接干涉”。
    帕拉马斯在这封信中说：“据报道，英国保安队同土耳其袭击者之间有着共谋。”他指出，英国当局迟迟不加干涉和采取充分行动来制止土耳其暴徒的袭击。
    据报纸透露，在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团常任代表理事会会议目前正在压迫希腊接受英国政府即将向议会宣布的解决塞浦路斯问题的计划。据“新闻报”报道，希腊政府打算拒绝这个计划。
    在塞浦路斯，土耳其暴徒继续逞凶。14日夜间又有一名希腊族居民被打死。
    希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫14日就英国殖民当局纵容土耳其暴徒逞凶杀害希腊族居民的行为向英国政府提出抗议。
    同时，在伊兹密尔（土耳其）的北大西洋集团东南欧总部工作的全部希腊籍人员及其家属约二百人，在14日已经乘飞机撤离土耳其回到希腊。
    另一方面，土耳其正在继续要求“分治”塞浦路斯。土耳其政府在写给联合国秘书长的一封信中强调，塞浦路斯岛上的土耳其居民同希腊居民“不可能在一个政权下共处”。土耳其当局连日来并且不断地组织煽动反对希腊的群众集会。
