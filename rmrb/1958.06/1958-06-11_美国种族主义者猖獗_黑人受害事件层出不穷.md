Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th Dispatch: In the United States, many incidents of savage persecution of black people have occurred recently.

According to the "Washington Post", in Dawson, Georgia, as black residents intensify their struggle for equal rights, racists are constantly harming black people. A black man was recently beaten by local police for no reason and died a few days later from severe brain injuries. Another black man was also shot dead by police for no reason. In addition, a black woman was imprisoned when she went to the prison to visit her son. An elementary school teacher with a university degree was dismissed because she "failed" the test of common election sense. The newspaper pointed out that a climate of terror hangs over the black residents of Dawson.

In St. Petersburg, Florida, city authorities ordered the closure of a swimming pool and a beach swimming area on the 5th and 9th, respectively, because black students had swam there. At the same time, Ku Klux Klan members burned crosses to intimidate black people who opposed racial discrimination. These activities have been protested by the NAACP.

On June 5, a black teacher, Clennon King, wanted to attend a summer course at the University of Mississippi. As a result, King was not only immediately rejected, but also arrested by the police and imprisoned in a single cell in the local police station on the orders of Mississippi Governor Coleman.

    据“华盛顿邮报”报道，在佐治亚州道逊城，由于黑人居民加紧为争取平等权利而斗争，种族主义者不断对黑人下毒手。一个黑人最近无故遭到当地警察的殴打，几天后因脑部受伤过重而死亡。另一个黑人也无端被警察开枪打死。此外，一个黑人妇女到监狱中探望她的儿子时，被监禁了起来。有一个有大学毕业证书的小学女教师因为“没有通过”测验选举常识的考试而被解聘这家报纸指出，恐怖的气氛笼罩着道逊城的黑人居民。
    在佛罗里达州彼得斯堡，市当局在5日和9日分别下令关闭一个游泳池和一个海滩游泳场，因为有黑人学生在那里游过泳。同时，三K党员焚烧了十字架，恫吓反对种族歧视的黑人。这些活动已经遭到“全国有色人种协进会”的抗议。
    6月5日，一个黑人教师克连侬·金格想参加密士失必州大学的暑期学习班。结果金格不仅立即遭到拒绝，而且由于密士失必州州长科尔曼的命令竟被警察局逮捕起来，被监禁在地方警察局的一个单间牢房里。
