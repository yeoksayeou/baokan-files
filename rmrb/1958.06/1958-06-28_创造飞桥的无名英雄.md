Greatness Arises from the Ordinary

    The Unnamed Hero Who Created the Flying Bridge
    Around the year 1000 AD, during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty in China, there was a Yangshui Bridge in Qingzhou, Shandong. Every year, during the months of June and July, mountain floods would break out and damage the bridge pillars. At that time, the usual method of repairing bridges was to bury pillars in the river and then rebuild the bridge, but the bridge pillars were always washed away. Later, a disabled soldier boldly abandoned the method of burying pillars in the river. He first used huge stones to build abutments on both banks of the river, and then used dozens of large wooden beams to build a bridge on the stones, shaping it like a 'rainbow' into an arch bridge, which was then called a flying bridge. Because it completely avoided the impact of floods, it was recorded at the time that it had not been damaged for more than fifty years. Unfortunately, due to the discrimination against working people in feudal society, this bold creator did not even have his name passed down, and was only called the Qingzhou Soldier.

    创造飞桥的无名英雄
    公元一千年左右，我国宋仁宗时候，山东青州有座洋水桥。那里每年到6、7月间山洪暴发，就把桥柱子冲坏了。当时一般修桥的总是用老一套的办法，在河里埋上柱子再修桥，而桥的柱子老是被冲坏。后来有一个残废的兵士，大胆地抛弃了在河中埋柱的方法，先用巨石砌在河的两岸，然后用几十根大木头在石上架桥，仿照‘虹’的形状架成一座环拱桥，当时称为飞桥。因为完全避免了洪水的冲击，据当时记载经过了五十多年还没有坏。可惜由于封建社会里歧视劳动人民，这位大胆的创造者竟连名字也没有流传下来，只是被人叫作青州卒。
