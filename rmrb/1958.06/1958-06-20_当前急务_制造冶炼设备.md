    Current Urgent Task - Manufacturing Smelting Equipment
    In the all-round Great Leap Forward of the national economy, the iron and steel industry is increasingly showing its key role in ensuring the Great Leap Forward. During this period, all localities are actively grasping the metallurgical industry, and the plans for small blast furnaces, small converters... are more amazing than the last. As the situation develops to this point, a new and decisive link has emerged, and that is the machinery industry. Because in the next two years, a large portion of the increased output value of many industries, including the metallurgical industry, will depend on newly built enterprises, that is, on increasing new equipment. If, after grasping the metallurgical industry, we do not immediately grasp the machinery industry and put the manufacturing of equipment first, we cannot guarantee the Great Leap Forward of industry. Among all kinds of equipment, the most important at present is smelting equipment. Because steel is the raw material of the machinery industry, we must first have enough steel before we can fully develop the machinery industry. Today's report in this newspaper about Shanghai mobilizing all forces to rush to manufacture smelting equipment shows that Shanghai has grasped the key to the current entire industrial Great Leap Forward. We hope that other places will also quickly take action to grasp this key.

    当前急务——制造冶炼设备
    在国民经济全面大跃进中，钢铁工业越来越显示出它对于保证大跃进的关键作用来。这一时期，各个地方都在积极抓冶金工业，小高炉、小转炉……规划一次比一次惊人。形势发展到这里，又一个新的决定性的环节出现了，这就是机械工业。因为，今明两年许多工业，包括冶金工业在内，新增的产值绝大部分要靠新建设的企业，也就是说，要靠增加新设备。如果在抓了冶金工业之后，不紧接着把机械工业抓起来，把制造设备放在第一位，就不能保证工业的大跃进。而在各种设备之中，当前最重要的又是冶炼设备。因为钢铁是机械工业的原料，首先要有足够的钢铁，然后才能充分发展机械工业。今天本报发表上海调动一切力量赶制冶炼设备的消息，说明上海是抓住了当前整个工业大跃进的关键。我们希望其他地方也赶快动手来抓这个关键。
