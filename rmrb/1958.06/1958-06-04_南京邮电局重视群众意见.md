　　Nanjing Post Office Values the Opinions of the Masses
　　On the afternoon of May 10th, a staff member notified me to go to the principal's office. When I entered the principal's office, I realized it wasn't the principal who was looking for me, but a comrade from the Nanjing Post Office. After talking, I learned that last October, I had sent several books from the Nanjing Post Office to Shandong, and the recipient only received them four months later. Afterwards, I reported this matter to the People's Daily. Four days ago, I received a letter from the People's Daily saying that my letter had been forwarded to the Nanjing Post Office for handling. The comrade who spoke with me in the principal's office was specifically sent by the Nanjing Post Office to solicit my opinion in order to deal with this matter. Although this is a small matter, it shows that the Nanjing Post Office values the opinions of the masses.

　　南京邮电局重视群众意见
    5月10日下午，公务员同志通知我到校长室去一下。我走进校长室，才知道不是校长找我，而是南京市邮局的一位同志。接谈后才知道：去年10月份，我由南京市邮局寄往山东几本书，对方在四个月以后才收到。后来我把这件事反映到人民日报，四天前，我收到了人民日报的回信说已把我的信转给南京市邮局处理了。在校长室找我谈话的同志，就是南京市邮局为了处理这件事特地派来征求意见的。这虽然是一件小事，却说明了南京市邮局重视群众意见。
