Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 18th:  When Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a report this morning to the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, he first pointed out that the 11th Party Congress is being convened under the sign of the great achievements of our socialist construction and under the sign of our putting forward the great task of completing socialist construction in our country.  The current state of our society entitles us to draw the following conclusion: in Czechoslovakia, the exploitation of man by man has been virtually eliminated, and the foundations of socialism have been basically built.  He said that our country is a member of the powerful socialist camp, and our solid alliance with the Soviet Union and the achievements we have already made enable us to take the completion of socialist construction in our country as our future goal.

Concerning the Current International Situation
The forces of socialism are advancing irresistibly throughout the world.  The positions of imperialism are destined to collapse.  The Yugoslav revisionist views are harmful to the socialist cause worldwide, and the Communist Parties of various countries are dealing them a fatal blow.

Novotný delivered a report to the Congress on the work of the Party Central Committee and the main tasks at present.  In the first part of his report, he discussed the current international situation.  Novotný said that our efforts to complete socialist construction are inextricably linked to the struggle of the world's socialist forces.  It is only because of the existence of the Soviet Union, the emergence of the socialist world system, and the unity of all revolutionary forces that we have been able to put forward the slogan of building socialism, and the completion of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia will further greatly strengthen the socialist camp.

Novotný said that at present, the forces of socialism are advancing irresistibly throughout the world.  The industrial production of the Soviet Union will surpass that of the United States in twelve to fifteen years.  The vigorous development of Great China has aroused the admiration of all progressive people.  During the same period, China will certainly surpass Britain, which was once the cradle of modern industry, in industrial production.

The positions of imperialism are destined to collapse.  The old-brand capitalist countries that once ruled the world now account for only one-fifth of the world's population, and most of them are working people and peace-loving people.

Novotný then pointed out that if the above facts lead to the conclusion that the positions of imperialism will disintegrate automatically and that imperialism will abandon any of its positions without a fight, that would be the biggest mistake.  We have previously openly criticized various revisionist theories that abandoned Lenin's theory of imperialism in a liquidationist manner.  It is now necessary to repeat this criticism clearly.  Many of the arguments contained in the Yugoslav program recently adopted are attempts to form a system of opportunist views on the nature of modern capitalism, and under the guise of Marxist phrases, they attempt to introduce anti-Leninist theories such as the supra-class nature of capitalist countries and the spontaneous generation of socialist society in capitalism into the workers' movement.  Obviously, allowing the spread of this view would create confusion in the ranks of the working class, weaken the revolutionary struggle of the working class, and harm the socialist cause worldwide.

The reporter said that recently, the role of U.S. imperialism as the center of international reaction and the deadly enemy of the people of all countries and all progressive forces has been clearly demonstrated.  Wherever conspiracies are carried out against the freedom and independence of the people of all countries, we can find the bloody hands of American monopoly capital.  This is the case in Guatemala, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Indonesia.

In response to the imperialist policy of war preparations, socialist countries are responding with a consistent policy of peace.  They implement the principles of peaceful coexistence in all aspects of international life and mobilize the broadest masses of the people to fight for the defense of peace.

In his report, Novotný emphasized the struggle of the working people for peace and socialism. He said that the main prerequisite for success now and in the future is our international communist movement. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave all Communist Parties a new and powerful impetus, and the documents adopted at the Moscow meeting last year further demonstrated the common experience and common will of our entire communist movement.

Novotný then spoke about the issue of combating revisionism. He pointed out that the international bourgeoisie organized a wide-ranging anti-communist propaganda, terror, and slander campaign after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and various opportunist factions that actively emerged within the workers' movement during this time gave the enemy no small amount of help. These opportunist factions are manifestations of the remnants and influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks, expressions of surrender to the pressure of the reactionaries, and tools used by imperialists to shake our ranks.

The Communist Parties of various countries have fought against revisionist tendencies in the past, and now they see more clearly that revisionist tendencies are the main danger threatening our movement and are dealing it a fatal blow.

The Yugoslav leaders strengthened the propaganda of their revisionist theories after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially during the Hungarian incident, which played a special role in the activation of international revisionist views. The draft program of the Yugoslav Communist Party and the development direction of the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party confirmed that the Yugoslav leaders still continue to adhere to their revisionist views, deliberately departing from the Marxist-Leninist views of the Communist Parties of various countries and the views of the Peace Manifesto they themselves signed on a series of the most fundamental issues. The Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party rejected comradely criticism without a fact-seeking study, and even opened fire not at the imperialists, but at the Communist Parties of various countries, at the Soviet Union and socialist countries. After the Congress, the Yugoslav Communist Party continued its actions in this regard, thus earning the praise of American imperialists.

Novotný firmly stated that our Party has adhered to the view that the 1948 Cominform resolution on Yugoslavia was correct in principle, but there were errors in the methods of implementation, and the November 1949 resolution was incorrect. Based on this view, our Party has shown sufficient goodwill since 1954 to approach the Yugoslav Communist Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. However, the Yugoslav leaders rejected the hand of friendship extended to them and continued to stubbornly adhere to their revisionist stance. Novotný said that in terms of state relations, we will continue to maintain mutually beneficial relations with Yugoslavia. And the future development of relations between our two parties will only depend on the future actions of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Our Party will continue to conduct Marxist analyses of the revisionist views that are particularly evident in Yugoslavia and publicly expose their harmful essence.

Novotný then said that our relations with socialist countries will be more thoroughly based on the principles of fraternal mutual assistance, and we oppose the attempts of revisionists to reduce this idea to merely equal relations and to view our mutual relations as purely commercial relations. We must jointly utilize all our resources and potentials to strengthen economic cooperation and strengthen the increasingly perfect international division of labor.

At the end of this part of his report, Novotný also pointed out that Czechoslovak diplomatic work has recently shown greater initiative and flexibility. A series of diplomatic actions by our government have increased our effective contribution to the common peaceful policies of socialist countries.

Concerning the Current Tasks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
To achieve the victory of socialist collective large-scale agricultural production in the countryside; to eliminate the remnants of hostile classes; to greatly develop productive forces on a highly technical basis; to fully develop socialist democracy; to strengthen the unity of the people and complete the cultural revolution in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

In the second part of his report, Novotný talked about the tasks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party on the road to completing socialist construction. Novotný pointed out that the basic content of completing socialist construction can be briefly expressed as five main tasks: (1) To achieve a decisive victory in socialist relations of production in places where small-scale commodity management still accounts for a certain proportion, that is, to achieve the victory of socialist collective large-scale agricultural production in the countryside; (2) To eliminate the remnants of hostile classes and gradually eliminate the remnants of rich peasants and small and medium-sized private business owners in cities as a class; (3) To continue to develop productive forces on the basis of high technology, especially automation, mechanization, and chemicalization, and to ensure the continuous improvement of people's living standards through the absolute growth of labor productivity; (4) To continuously and fully develop socialist democracy and promote the active participation of the working people in the management of the state and the economy; (5) To continue to strengthen the unity of the people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and complete the cultural revolution.

Novotný said that we understand the completion of socialist construction as an entire stage of development, in which we will accumulate strength in order to transition to communism.

Regarding the establishment of socialist relations of production and the completion of social class changes, Novotný said that in the coming period, we will devote all our efforts to completing the socialist transformation of agriculture and basically complete the transition to collective large-scale production in the next two years. In those places where we have already firmly established socialist relations of production, we must continuously strengthen these relations of production. He also pointed out that the struggle against speculation and theft of social property is an important form of class struggle. He said that we must also resolutely fight against the attempts of past business owners to revive private enterprises.

Novotný said that the basic characteristic of the current class composition in Czechoslovakia is a solid alliance of workers and peasants led by the working class. Workers and their families now account for more than 62% of the country's population. On the road to the final victory of socialism, we must continue to strengthen the influence of the working class in all aspects of our lives. The working class has not only liberated and transformed itself, but also transformed and liberated other working people. A new class is being formed in our countryside - cooperative farmers. The policy of restricting and squeezing out rich peasants has reduced the area of cultivated land owned by rich peasants from 14.1% to 1.6% of the country's cultivated land in the past six years. New forces from the working people are constantly changing the organizational composition of the intelligentsia. We have successfully united the vast majority of the old intelligentsia to our side and are guiding them to serve the people.

Novotný then pointed out that the consolidation of socialist relations of production and the differentiation of classes are carried out in an organized and targeted manner under the leadership of the Party. He said that we do not see the development of society as free of contradictions. On the contrary, the Party believes that the confrontation of things and the overcoming of contradictions are the driving forces of the development of things. Therefore, the Party constantly studies the essence of contradictions in society and keenly distinguishes between antagonistic and non-antagonistic, inevitable and accidental contradictions. The Party solved the basic contradictions in our country in a short period of time. In the further construction of socialism, non-antagonistic contradictions, such as the contradiction between production and needs, the contradiction between the base and the superstructure, etc., will be given primary importance. The Party focuses its attention on solving those major contradictions that are of great significance for further development. Broadly carrying out criticism and self-criticism and realizing socialist democracy will be the basic methods for resolving these contradictions.

Novotný emphasized that the main battlefield for completing socialist construction is the national economy, industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture. In order to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to develop productive forces and, on this basis, improve the material and cultural standards of the people.

After summarizing the tremendous achievements of the national economy in the past decade, Novotný put forward the political and economic guidelines for the 11th Party Congress and the basic direction and goals of economic development until 1965. The guidelines and goals in these areas are: (1) To further enhance the role of industry in the national economy, and industrial production should increase by 90% to 95% by 1965 compared with 1957;
(2) To establish modern socialist agriculture equipped with efficient machinery, using chemical fertilizers extensively, and with high yields per unit area. Agricultural production should increase by about 40% by 1965 compared with 1957; (3) To increase the amount of construction work by 70% to 80% during the same period; (4) In 1965, the volume of transportation in the transportation industry should increase by 90% to 95% compared with 1957; (5) Industrial production in the Slovak region should more than double by 1965 compared with 1957, and the Czech region should greatly increase agricultural production in the shortest possible time; (6) To promote the specialization and cooperation of production in socialist camp countries; (7) By 1965, industrial labor productivity should increase by about 75% compared with 1957, and in agriculture, it will approximately double; (8) To reduce the prices of major consumer goods and increase people's actual income, paying special attention to improving the living standards of families with many children. It is expected that personal consumption will increase by about 45% by 1965 compared with 1957. By 1970, the housing problem will be basically solved.

Novotný then specifically analyzed the tasks of the Party in industry, construction, and transportation. He pointed out that by 1965, the national output of hard coal will reach 35 million to 36 million tons, an increase of 40% compared with 1957; brown coal will increase from the current 49 million tons to 77 million tons; electricity generation will reach 38 billion kilowatt-hours; steel production will reach 9.2 million to 9.7 million tons; machinery manufacturing production will increase by 130% compared with 1957; and chemical industry production will increase by 2.5 times compared with 1957. The reporter emphasized that it is necessary to concentrate all forces to develop the production of synthetic rubber and new synthetic materials and eliminate the backwardness in the chemical industry in the shortest possible time.

Novotný said that the amount of construction work will expand by 207% in the next ten years, and at the same time, the technical level and economic efficiency of capital construction should be improved. We must dare to build complete, brand-new, and highly developed industrial bases on a large scale, and at the same time vigorously develop the transportation industry.

Novotný then also talked about carrying out a technical revolution, improving labor productivity, and improving industrial leadership.

When talking about agricultural issues, Novotný pointed out that agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms currently account for 71% of all agricultural land. The good production results and economic results of the vast majority of cooperatives convincingly prove the superiority of socialist large-scale production. By 1965, it is entirely possible to meet the needs for several major agricultural and livestock products through our own production and gradually reduce the import volume of agricultural products to a minimum. He emphasized that it is possible for us to catch up with advanced capitalist countries in a short period of time, not only in terms of yield per unit area of agricultural production, but also in terms of labor productivity.

Novotný then elaborated on the issue of developing socialist democracy in his report. He pointed out that guided by Marxism-Leninism, we resolutely reject the revisionist view that the state is like a super-class organization, because this view conceals the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, glorifies imperialism, and covers up the imperialist conspiracies and purposes. We found in the Yugoslav program that this revisionist elaboration made in evaluating the situation of socialist countries erroneously juxtaposes socialist democracy with the dictatorship of the proletariat. We also reject the revisionist view that it seems that the demise of the state is the main and urgent task of socialist countries at present.

When talking about the main tasks of the cultural revolution, Novotný emphasized the special importance of ideological work. He said that the Party Central Committee's plenary session in June last year regarded the cultural revolution as an integral part of completing socialist construction. In the past few years, we have made considerable achievements in raising the socialist consciousness of the working people. Socialist ideology has become the property of the vast majority of the working people. Novotný pointed out that the first basic task of the cultural revolution is to bring culture closer to the people, ensure the people's right to education, and give schools new socialist content. The second main task of the cultural revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology and strengthen the influence of our communist ideology in all aspects. Novotný also emphasized that completing socialist construction also requires maximizing the development of science, especially natural science.

Novotný said that in the struggle to educate new socialist people, literary and artistic creation occupies an important position. Only when writers are closely connected with the lives of our people and truthfully and convincingly reflect the revolutionary struggle and development prospects of our people can literary and artistic works created in this way play a positive role in society.

Novotný then emphatically pointed out that the Party is the guarantee for completing socialist construction. He said that the Czechoslovak Communist Party is unswervingly loyal to the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the whole Party is united, and the people of the whole country are also united around the Party. At present, the Party has been further consolidated politically, ideologically, and organizationally. As of January 1 this year, the entire Party has a total of 1,422,199 members and alternate members, with 47,478 grass-roots organizations. In the recent period, the basic tasks facing the entire Party are: to consolidate the Party's leadership in our country's life, to further strengthen the Leninist principles in the Party's work, to consolidate collective leadership, to promote intra-Party democracy, and to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

Novotný then emphasized that in carrying out the Party's ideological work, we should be aware that completing socialist construction will bring many new issues that need to be studied theoretically. Marxism-Leninism should be developed and enriched with the new experience of the international workers' movement. In the field of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, we should focus on studying the dialectical characteristics of real life and the Party's revolutionary practice, so as to help Party members and cadres to master the scientific method of Marxism.

Finally, Novotný called on the entire Party to struggle to realize the Party's general line, and called on the entire Party to advance towards the victory of socialism!

    诺沃提尼向捷共代表大会作中央工作报告
    号召全党向社会主义的胜利前进
    修正主义倾向是工人运动中的主要危险　应给以致命打击
    新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼今天上午在捷共第十一次代表大会上作报告时首先指出，第十一次党代表大会是在我们社会主义建设获得重大成就的标志下、在我们提出在我国完成社会主义建设的伟大任务的标志下召开的。我国社会的目前状况使我们有权作出以下结论：在捷克斯洛伐克实际上已经消灭了人对人的剥削，基本上已经建成了社会主义的基础。他说，我国是强大的社会主义阵营的一员，我们和苏联的巩固同盟和我们业已取得的成绩——这些使我们能够以在我国完成社会主义建设作为今后的目标。
    关于当前国际形势
  社会主义力量正在全世界不可阻挡地前进。帝国主义的阵地定将垮台。南共修正主义观点有害于全世界社会主义事业，各国共产党正给以致命的打击。
    诺沃提尼向代表大会作了党中央委员会工作和目前主要任务的报告。他在报告的第一部分论述了当前的国际形势。诺沃提尼说，我们完成社会主义建设的努力是和世界社会主义力量的斗争牢不可分地联系在一起的。只是由于苏联的存在、由于产生了社会主义世界体系和一切革命力量的团结，才使我们有可能提出建成社会主义这个口号，而在捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设又将进一步大大地加强社会主义阵营。
    诺沃提尼说，目前社会主义力量正在全世界不可阻挡地前进。苏联的工业生产在十二至十五年后将超过美国。伟大中国的蓬勃发展引起了一切进步人们的钦佩。在同一时期中，中国一定会在工业生产方面超过曾经是现代工业摇篮的英国。
    帝国主义的阵地定将垮台。过去统治过全世界的老牌资本主义国家，现在只有全人类五分之一的人口，而且其中大多数是劳动人民与爱好和平的人。
    诺沃提尼接着指出，但是如果由于上述事实得出结论说，帝国主义的阵地会自动瓦解，帝国主义将会不经战斗便放弃自己的任何一个阵地，那便是最大的错误了。我们以前曾经公开地批评过以取消派的方式抛弃了列宁关于帝国主义的学说的各种修正主义理论。现在需要重新明确地重复这个批评。不久以前通过的南共纲领中所包含的许多论点，就是企图形成一种对现代资本主义性质的机会主义观点的体系，是在马克思主义词句的外衣下企图使资本主义国家的超阶级性和社会主义社会在资本主义中自发产生等反列宁主义的理论，渗透到工人运动中去。很明显，让这种观点传播就会在工人阶级队伍中造成混乱，削弱工人阶级的革命斗争，损害全世界的社会主义事业。
    报告人说，最近时期中，美帝国主义作为国际反动派中心和各国人民及一切进步力量的死敌的作用明显地表现了出来。凡是进行反对各国人民自由和独立的阴谋的地方，我们都可以找到美国垄断资本的血手。在危地马拉、约旦是如此，在叙利亚、黎巴嫩、印度尼西亚也是如此。
    对于帝国主义的备战政策，社会主义国家以一贯执行的和平政策作为回答。它们在国际生活的一切方面执行和平共处的原则，动员最广大的人民来进行保卫和平的斗争。
    诺沃提尼在报告中强调劳动人民为争取和平和社会主义的斗争。他说，现在和将来能够取得成功的主要前提是我们的国际共产主义运动。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会给了所有的共产党以新的强有力的推进力，而去年莫斯科会议所通过的文件更加表现了我们整个共产主义运动的共同经验和共同意志。
    诺沃提尼接着谈到同修正主义作斗争的问题。他指出，国际资产阶级在苏共第二十次代表大会以后组织了广泛的反共宣传、恐怖和诽谤运动，而工人运动内部在这个时间里积极活跃起来的各种机会主义流派给予敌人不小帮助。这些机会主义流派是资产阶级和小资产阶级思想残余和影响在我们队伍中的表现，是对反动派的压力投降的表现，是帝国主义者用来动摇我们队伍的工具。
    各国共产党在以前就与修正主义倾向展开过斗争，现在更加看清了修正主义倾向是威胁我们运动的主要危险，并且给它以致命的打击。
    南共领导人在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，特别是在匈牙利事件上加强了自己修正主义理论的宣传，这对国际修正主义观点的活跃起了特殊的作用。南共纲领草案和南共第七次代表大会的发展方向证实了南共领导人仍然继续坚持他们的修正主义观点，在一系列最原则性的问题上故意地离开了各国共产党的马克思列宁主义观点和他们自己签了字的和平宣言的观点。南共第七次代表大会没有经过实事求是的研究就拒绝了同志式的批评，甚至不是向着帝国主义者、而是对着各国共产党、对着苏联和社会主义国家开了火。代表大会以后，南共仍然继续这方面的行动，这样，南共就博得了美国帝国主义者的赞赏。
    诺沃提尼坚定地声称，我们党以前和现在都坚持这一观点：1948年情报局关于南斯拉夫的决议原则上是正确的，但是在执行的方法上有错误，而1949年11月的决议是不正确的。根据这一观点，我们党从1954年起，表示了足够的善意来同南共在马克思列宁主义的基础上相接近。但是南共领导人拒绝了向他们伸出的友谊之手，并且更加顽固地继续坚持他们的修正主义立场。诺沃提尼说，在国家方面，我们将继续同南斯拉夫保持对双方有益的相互关系。而我们两党间关系的将来的发展，只有取决于南共以后的行动方式。我们党以后仍将对在南斯拉夫表现得特别明显的修正主义观点进行马克思主义的分析，并且公开揭露其有害的实质。
    诺沃提尼接着说，我们同社会主义各国的关系将更加彻底地依据兄弟般的互助原则，我们反对修正主义者把这一思想缩小成仅仅是平等的关系和把我们间的相互关系看作是纯商业关系的企图。我们要共同利用我们的一切资源和潜力，以加强经济合作，加强日趋完善的国际分工。
    诺沃提尼在报告这一部分的结尾中还指出，最近捷克斯洛伐克外交工作表现出了更大的主动和灵活。我国政府的一系列外交行动增大了我们对社会主义国家共同的和平政策的有效贡献。
    关于捷共当前任务
    要在农村取得社会主义集体大农业生产的胜利；消除敌对阶级残余；在高度技术基础上大大发展生产力；全面发展社会主义民主；按照马列主义精神，加强人民团结，完成文化革命。
    诺沃提尼在报告的第二部分谈到了捷共在完成社会主义建设道路上的任务。诺沃提尼指出，完成社会主义建设的基本内容可以简括地表现为五项主要任务：（1）在小商品经营方式仍占一定比重的地方取得社会主义生产关系的决定性胜利，也就是在农村取得社会主义集体大农业生产的胜利；（2）消除敌对阶级残余，把富农和城市中小私有企业者的残余作为一个阶级逐渐地加以消灭；（3）在高度技术，特别是自动化、机械和化学化的基础上继续发展生产力，通过劳动生产率的绝对增长，来保证人民生活水平的不断提高；（4）不断地全面发展社会主义民主，促进劳动人民积极参与国家和经济的管理；（5）按照马克思列宁主义精神，继续加强人民的团结，并且完成文化革命。
    诺沃提尼说，我们把完成社会主义建设理解为一整个的发展阶段，在这个阶段中，我们将积蓄力量以便过渡到共产主义。
    在确立社会主义生产关系和完成社会阶级变化方面，诺沃提尼说，今后一个时期，我们将全力完成农业的社会主义改造，并且在最近两年内基本上完成向集体大生产的过渡。在那些我们已经巩固地建立了社会主义生产关系的地方，必须不断加强这种生产关系。他还指出，同投机和盗窃社会财产的现象作斗争是阶级斗争的一个重要形式。他说，我们还必须同过去的企业主复活私有企业的企图进行坚决的斗争。
    诺沃提尼说，捷克斯洛伐克目前阶级组成的基本特点，是以工人阶级为领导力量的牢固的工农联盟。现在工人和他们的家属已经占全国人口的62％以上。在通向社会主义最后胜利的道路上必须继续加强工人阶级在我们生活中一切方面的影响。工人阶级不仅解放和改造了自己，而且也改造和解放了其他劳动人民。在我们的农村中正在形成一个新的阶级——合作社农民。限制和排挤富农的政策使六年来富农拥有的耕地面积从占全国耕地的14.1％降低到1.6％。来自劳动人民中的新生力量不断地改变着知识分子队伍的组织成分。我们已经成功地把绝大部分旧知识分子团结到我们方面，并且引导着他们去为人民服务。
    诺沃提尼接着指出，社会主义生产关系的巩固和阶级的分化是在党的领导下有组织、有目标地进行的。他说，我们对社会的发展不看成是没有矛盾的，相反地党认为，事物的对抗和矛盾的克服是事物发展的动力。因此，党不断地研究社会中矛盾的实质，敏锐地区分对抗性和非对抗性的、必然的和偶然的矛盾。党在短时期内解决了我国的基本矛盾。在进一步建设社会主义的过程中，非对抗性的矛盾，如生产和需要之间的矛盾、基础和上层建筑的矛盾等，将被提到首要的地位。党把它的注意力集中在解决对进一步发展有巨大意义的那些主要矛盾上面。广泛地开展批评和自我批评、实现社会主义民主将是解决这些矛盾的基本方法。
    诺沃提尼强调指出，完成社会主义建设的主要战场是国民经济，是工业、建筑业、运输业和农业。为了达到这个目标，必须首先发展生产力，并且在这个基础上提高人民的物质和文化水平。
    诺沃提尼在总结了十年来国民经济的巨大成就以后，提出了第十一次党代大会的政治经济方针和到1965年的经济发展的基本方向和目标。这些方面的方针和目标是：（1）进一步提高国民经济中工业的作用，到1965年工业生产要比1957年增加90％到95％；
  （2）建立用效率高的机械装备起来的、广泛使用化学肥料的、单位面积产量高的现代化社会主义农业。到1965年农业生产要比1957年大约增加40％；（3）在同一时期内把建设工程量提高70％到80％；（4）1965年，运输业的运输量要比1957年提高90％到95％；（5）斯洛伐克地区1965年的工业生产要比1957年增加一倍以上，捷克地区要在最短期间大大提高农业生产；（6）促进社会主义阵营各国生产的专业化和合作；（7）到1965年工业劳动生产率要比1957年约提高75％，在农业方面将大约提高一倍；（8）降低主要消费品价格和增加人民实际收入，特别注意提高多子女家庭的生活水平。到1965年预计个人消费量要比1957年约提高45％。到1970年时，将基本上解决住房问题。
    诺沃提尼随后具体地分析了党在工业、建筑业和交通、运输业方面的任务。他指出，到1965年时，全国硬煤产量将达到三千五百万到三千六百万吨，比1957年提高40％；褐煤要从目前的四千九百万吨提高到七千七百万吨；发电量将达到三百八十亿度；钢的产量将达到九百二十万到九百七十万吨；机器制造业的生产将比1957年增加130％；化学工业的产量将比1957年增加二点五倍。报告人强调必须集中一切力量来发展人造橡胶和新的合成物质的生产，在最短期间内消灭化学工业方面的落后现象。
    诺沃提尼说，建筑业的工作量在今后十年内要扩大207％，同时应当提高基本建设的技术水平和经济效果。要勇于以巨大的规模进行建立完整、崭新、高度发展的工业基地，同时要大力发展运输业。
    诺沃提尼接着还谈到了开展技术革命、提高劳动生产率和改进工业领导的问题。
    在谈到农业问题时诺沃提尼指出，目前农业合作社和国营农场共占全部农业土地的71％。绝大部分合作社良好的生产效果和经济效果令人信服地证明了社会主义大生产的优越性。到1965年完全有条件靠自己的生产来满足对几种主要农产品和畜产品的需要，并且逐步把农产品的进口量缩减到最低限度。他强调说，我们有可能在短时期内，不但在农业生产的单位面积产量方面赶上先进的资本主义国家，而且在劳动生产率方面也将赶上它们。
    诺沃提尼接着在报告中阐述了发展社会主义民主的问题。他指出，我们以马克思列宁主义为指南，坚决拒绝那种对国家像对超阶级组织那样的修正主义观点，因为这种观点掩盖着无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾，美化帝国主义，并且为帝国主义的侵略阴谋和目的打掩护。我们在南共纲领中发现，在评价社会主义国家情况时所作的这种修正主义的阐述，把社会主义民主错误地同无产阶级专政对立起来。我们也拒绝似乎国家消亡是目前社会主义各国的主要的迫切任务这种修正主义观点。
    诺沃提尼在谈到文化革命的主要任务时强调了思想工作的特殊重要意义。他说，党中央去年6月全会就把文化革命作为完成社会主义建设的一个不可分割的部分。在过去的年代里，我们在提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟方面已经取得了不少的成绩。社会主义思想已经成为绝大多数劳动人民的财产。诺沃提尼指出，文化革命的第一个基本任务是，使文化接近人民，保证人民受教育的权利，给学校以新的社会主义内容。文化革命的第二个主要任务是，清除资产阶级思想，从各方面加强我们共产主义思想的影响。诺沃提尼还强调完成社会主义建设也要求最大限度地发展科学，首先是自然科学。
    诺沃提尼说，在教育社会主义新人的斗争中，文学艺术创作占有重要的地位。只有作家紧密地同我国人民的生活相联系，真实并且令人信服地反映我国人民的革命斗争和发展前途，这样创作的文艺作品才能够对社会起积极作用。
    诺沃提尼接着着重指出党是完成社会主义建设的保障。他说，捷共毫不动摇地忠于革命的马克思列宁主义学说，全党团结一致，全国人民也团结在党的周围。目前党在政治思想和组织方面都更加巩固了。截至今年1月1日，全党共有党员和候补党员一百四十二万二千一百九十九名，有四万七千四百七十八个基层组织。在最近时期内，全党所面临的基本任务是：在我国的生活中巩固党的领导，进一步加强党的工作中的列宁主义原则，巩固集体领导，发扬党内民主，开展批评和自我批评。
    诺沃提尼接着强调指出，在进行党的思想工作时，应该意识到完成社会主义建设将带来许多需要从理论上进行研究的新问题。马克思列宁主义应当以国际工人运动的新的经验加以发展和丰富。在马克思列宁主义哲学领域中，要着重研究现实生活和党的革命实践的辩证的特征，从而有助于党员干部去掌握马克思主义的科学方法。
    最后，诺沃提尼号召全党为实现党的总路线而斗争，号召全党向着社会主义的胜利前进！
