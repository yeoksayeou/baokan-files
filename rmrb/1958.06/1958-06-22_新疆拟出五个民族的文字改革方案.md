Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 21st: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's Ethnic Languages and Writing Systems Research Steering Committee has drafted preliminary new writing reform programs (initial drafts) for the Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, and Xibe ethnic groups, based on the Latin alphabet.

The committee recently held a plenary meeting of researchers to further discuss ways to improve the programs and to standardize new words and terms in various ethnic languages. The meeting decided to submit the drafts to relevant departments and individuals in the autonomous region for discussion and feedback as soon as possible, in order to make further revisions before submitting them to people from all ethnic groups and strata and the broad masses for extensive discussion.

The meeting unanimously proposed that in formulating new words and terms for various ethnic groups, Chinese loanwords that have already been used by the masses of various ethnic groups should be absorbed as much as possible, and should be sorted out and published at any time. It is necessary to prevent and overcome the tendency of local nationalism that is divorced from reality and unwilling to adopt Chinese loanwords that have been widely used by various ethnic groups.

The existing writing systems of the Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Xibe ethnic groups all have a long history and have made great contributions to the development of their respective cultures, the enrichment of the motherland's cultural treasury, and the consolidation of ethnic unity. However, because these writing systems have many changes in form, complex additional symbols, and are inconvenient to write, they cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of Xinjiang's socialist construction. Adopting the same Latin alphabet as the Chinese Pinyin scheme to reform the current writing systems of the above ethnic groups will be conducive to strengthening the unification of the motherland and the unity between the people of all ethnic groups, and will be conducive to the prosperity and development of the economic and cultural construction undertakings of all ethnic groups.

    新疆拟出五个民族的文字改革方案
    新华社乌鲁木齐21日电  新疆维吾尔自治区民族语言文字研究指导委员会拟订出了以拉丁文字母为基础的维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜、锡伯等五个民族的新文字改革方案（初步草案）。
    这个委员会最近召开全体研究人员会议，进一步讨论了改进这个方案的办法，和各少数民族新词、术语的规范化的问题。会议决定提前将草案提交自治区有关部门和有关人员进行讨论，征集意见，以便尽快作进一步修改，然后交给自治区各民族各阶层人士和广大人民群众广泛讨论。
    会议一致提出在制定各少数民族的新词、术语方面，应该尽量吸收各民族人民群众已经习惯使用的汉语借词，并随时加以整理和发表。防止和克服那种不愿采用各少数民族已经广泛应用的汉语借词的脱离实际的地方民族主义倾向。
    维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古和锡伯等民族现用的文字，都有悠久的历史，对发展本民族的文化、丰富祖国文化宝库、巩固民族团结等方面，都有很大的贡献。但是，由于这些文字字形变化多，附加符号复杂，书写不便，不能适应新疆社会主义建设事业飞速发展的需要。采用和汉语拼音方案相同的拉丁文字母来改革以上各民族的现行文字，将有利于加强祖国的统一和各族人民之间的团结，有利于繁荣发展各民族的经济文化建设事业。
