Starting Early is a Major Key to Achieving High Yields
    Cadres and Masses in the Guanzhong Area Discuss Experiences in Wheat Harvesting

    (Our dispatch) Reporter Zhu Bo reports: This year, the more than 16 million mu of wheat in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. There are many reasons for the wheat harvest, such as cultivating improved varieties, preparing the land to preserve moisture, close planting, fertilizing, and winter and spring irrigation. However, when the cadres and the masses here introduce these yield-increasing experiences to you, they always conclude by attributing it to "starting early last year." For example, when discussing land preparation and moisture conservation, they always say that because they started early last year, they were able to carry out deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and only then were they able to preserve the soil moisture; because the seed selection work started early last year, the selection was refined and meticulous.... The masses in Guanzhong recognize that starting early is the main experience for a bumper wheat harvest. They say, "Wheat is harvested in the same year it's planted," and "If wheat can be sown well, then more than half of the bumper harvest is guaranteed." ... When we visited the high-yield wheat field of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County, we happened to meet Liu Jingchun, Deputy County Head of Weinan County, there. He listed the specific circumstances of each task in the wheat harvest movement in Weinan County, explaining the reasons why it is necessary to start in advance.

    Weinan County has more than 593,000 mu of wheat. The plan for this was put forward before the summer harvest last year, and the main measures for wheat harvest were "three earlies" (early harvest, early planting, and early land preparation), "two adequacies" (adequate fertilizer and adequate seeding rate), and "four 100 percents" (100 percent deep plowing, narrow-row uniform sowing, selection and breeding of improved varieties, and seed dressing and soaking). The workload of implementing these three measures is quite heavy. Taking fertilizer as an example, calculating an average application of 14,000 jin per mu, all wheat fields require more than 8.3 billion jin of fertilizer. If the masses are not mobilized to accumulate fertilizer early, there will be no way to obtain so much fertilizer when it is needed, and the measure of adequate fertilizer will fail. The same applies to other measures, which all need to be carried out in advance. Only by adhering to the spirit of starting everything early can the various measures for wheat harvest be completed smoothly, and this year's wheat can be harvested.

    However, when the busy summer harvest season arrives, harvesting wheat, preparing the land, and planting autumn crops are all concentrated together. How can the labor force arrangement guarantee the implementation of the spirit of "one early leads to everything early"? Last year, during the summer harvest, the Heping Agricultural Cooperative divided the labor force of the entire cooperative into three groups according to the actual situation, responsible for harvesting wheat, planting autumn crops, and managing cotton fields, respectively. This is the "four simultaneous operations method" of "harvesting wheat while transporting manure, preparing the land, and planting autumn crops." This way, one task is linked to another, neither affecting the wheat harvest nor affecting the wheat planting, and these tasks can be completed in advance. According to the results of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative's actions, the work of wheat harvest and autumn planting can be completed in its entirety within fifteen days, more than ten days earlier than in the past.

    This year, the agricultural cooperatives here are still using the "four simultaneous operations method." Their slogan is to clear the threshing ground completely within ten days and plant all the autumn crops.

### 早动手是获得丰产的主要一环  关中地区干部和群众谈小麦丰收经验

　　早动手是获得丰产的主要一环
    关中地区干部和群众谈小麦丰收经验
    本报讯　记者朱波报道：今年陕西省关中地区一千六百多万亩小麦获得空前的大丰收。小麦丰收的原因很多，例如培育良种，整地保墒，密植，施肥和冬灌春灌等，但是这里的干部和群众在向你介绍这些增产经验时，讲到最后都要归结到“去年动手早”这一问题上去。例如讲到整地保墒时，总是说由于去年动手早，才做到了深耕细作，才能把底墒保住；去年选种工作动手早，因此选的精选的细，……关中群众认识到早动手是小麦丰产的主要经验，他们说“麦收当年墒”，“小麦能够播种好，就可以保住丰收的一大半了”。……我们参观渭南县和平农业社小麦丰产田时，碰巧渭南县刘景春副县长也在那里。他列举了渭南县小麦丰产运动中各项工作的具体情况，说明必须提前动手的道理。
    渭南县共有五十九万三千多亩小麦，这个计划在去年夏收前就提出来了，并且提出小麦丰产的几项主要措施是“三早”（早收早种早整地）、“两足”（肥料足和下种量足）、“四个百分之百”（百分之百的深耕、窄行匀播、选育良种和拌药浸种），贯彻这三项措施的工作量是相当重的。就以肥料为例，每亩平均施一万四千斤计算，全部麦田需要八十三亿多斤肥料，如果不提早发动群众积肥，等到用肥时就没有办法搞到这么多肥料，肥料足的措施就会落空。其它各种措施也是一样，都需要提前进行。只有这样坚持一切从早动手的精神，小麦丰产的各项措施才能顺利完成，今年的小麦才能丰收。
    但是，正当繁忙的夏收时节，收麦、整地、种秋等活路都集中在一起，又如何在劳动力安排方面，保证贯彻“一早百早”的精神呢？去年夏收时和平农业社根据实际情况，把全社的劳动力分为三班人马，分别负责收麦、种秋和棉田管理等活路。这就是“边收麦、边送粪、边整地和边种秋”等“四边工作法”。这样一环扣一环，既不影响收麦，又不影响种麦，而且还可以提前做完这些活路。根据和平农业社这样做的结果，在十五天内即可以全部完成麦收和种秋的工作，比过去提前十多天。
    今年，这里各农业社仍然采用了“四边工作法”。他们的口号是十天内地净场光，并且全部种上秋庄稼。
