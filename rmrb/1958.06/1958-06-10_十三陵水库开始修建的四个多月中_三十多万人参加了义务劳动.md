Xinhua News Agency, June 9th—In the four months since the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing began, over 317,000 people have participated in voluntary labor.

In this labor army, there are workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government agencies, university students, many ministers from central ministries, many leaders from various people's organizations and democratic parties, senior generals from troops stationed in Beijing, representatives attending meetings in Beijing, and many leaders from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee.

Chairman Mao Zedong and other party and state leaders, as well as leaders from the CCP committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and the Party committees of the troops, have also participated in voluntary labor successively. These leaders appeared on the construction site as ordinary laborers, shoveling soil, carrying baskets, transporting materials, and moving stones alongside the reservoir builders. They chatted and joked during breaks, giving the reservoir builders tremendous encouragement.

Many writers, poets, painters, photographers, actors, singers, and other literary and artistic workers from the capital have also come to the construction site one after another. They participated in labor while engaging in creation. During breaks, actors and singers performed for the laborers. As soon as advanced operating methods and excellent achievements from various units appeared, the construction site's radio station would immediately broadcast them, and literary and artistic workers would immediately turn them into clapper rhymes or lyrics or come to congratulate them with good news reports. The entire construction site was filled with a tense and joyful atmosphere day and night.

People participating in voluntary labor demonstrated high labor enthusiasm. Since the reservoir began construction, thousands of collectives and individuals have received banners and medals from the construction site headquarters. Among those who have won medals, many are generals of the People's Liberation Army.

Currently, the main project of this reservoir—the dam—is nearing completion. Many people who have not had the opportunity to participate in voluntary labor at the reservoir for a week or ten days have recently flocked to the construction site to carry out one to three days of voluntary labor. Some people who are very busy take advantage of the evening or Sunday to rush to the construction site and participate in a night or a day of voluntary labor. On the highway from Beijing to the Ming Tombs Reservoir, vehicles transporting people participating in voluntary labor have been flowing day and night in recent days. Whether day or night, people participating in voluntary labor can be seen everywhere near the construction site, marching in lines, carrying red flags, and singing songs, crossing paths as they head to or leave the construction site. The torrent of people and the tense and busy scene on the construction site are intertwined to form a magnificent picture of socialist construction.

　　十三陵水库开始修建的四个多月中
    三十多万人参加了义务劳动
    新华社9日讯　北京十三陵水库开始修建至今四个多月来，已经有三十一万七千多人来这里参加了义务劳动。
    在这支劳动大军中，有工人、农民、解放军官兵、机关干部、大学学生，有中央各部的许多部长，各人民团体、各民主党派的许多负责人和驻京部队的高级将领，有外地来京开会的代表以及中共北京市委和市人民委员会的许多负责人。
    毛泽东主席和党和国家的其他领导人，中共各省、市、自治区委员会以及部队党委的负责人，也先后参加了义务劳动。这些领导人都以一个普通劳动者的身份出现在工地上，和水库的建设者们一起铲土抬筐，运料搬石，休息时说笑谈天，给了水库建设者们极大的鼓舞。
    首都很多作家、诗人、画家、摄影师、演员、歌唱家等文艺工作者，也先后来到建设工地，他们一面参加劳动，一面从事创作。演员、歌唱家在休息时间内，就为劳动者表演节目。先进的操作方法和各个单位的优异成绩一经出现，工地上的广播电台就立即广播，文艺工作者就立即把它编成快板、歌词或举着喜报前来祝贺。整个工地日日夜夜充满了紧张愉快的气氛。
    参加义务劳动的人们表现了高涨的劳动热情。从水库开始建设到现在，有成千上万的集体和个人得到了工地指挥部的奖旗和奖章，荣获奖章的人们中有不少是人民解放军的将军。
    目前，这个水库的主要工程——拦河大坝快要完工了。很多没有轮得上到水库参加义务劳动一周或十天的人们，最近纷纷涌向建设工地去进行一天到三天的义务劳动。一些工作很忙的人就利用夜晚或星期日的空隙赶到工地，参加一夜或一天的义务劳动。在北京通往十三陵水库的公路上，这几天运送参加义务劳动的人们的车辆，日夜川流不息。不论白天还是夜晚，工地附近到处可以看到参加义务劳动的人们，排着队，扛着红旗、唱着歌曲，交错着走向或离开工地。人的洪流和工地上紧张忙碌的景象，交织成了一幅宏伟的社会主义建设图景。
