    Flood Prevention Is Absolutely Not Over
    Nancun
    After the great development of water conservancy, a new theory called "flood prevention is over" has recently emerged. It is said that so many water conservancy projects and soil and water conservation projects have been built that floods can be controlled, and there is no need for flood prevention this year. When the Heze Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province sent people to participate in the Yellow River flood control conference, some comrades disapproved, saying, "Why are we still going to a flood control conference? There's not enough water to drink!" Some counties in the Yellow River flood detention area have almost pulled the flood detention agencies and cadres to do other work. Some comrades even said: "The masses are engaged in large-scale water conservancy, and if we mention flood detention again, we will be divorced from the masses!"
    Every year before the arrival of floods, there are various kinds of paralyzing ideas. It seems that this year, those with paralyzing ideas have more reasons. Indeed, after the high tide of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, our vast land has been dotted with water conservancy projects; in most areas, it can be said that we have set up an inescapable net for floods, and wherever floods come, we can eliminate them. However, can we conclude that flood prevention is over? Of course not. Although the water conservancy projects we have newly built are worth a million troops, they have not yet been tested by floods. How can we predetermine that they are "foolproof"? Moreover, our water conservancy construction is far from over. Take Henan Province, where the water conservancy movement is fast and good, for example. Now, they have basically realized water conservancy, and most of the farmland has been freed from the threat of ordinary drought and flood disasters. However, this can only be done under the condition of 200 millimeters of rainfall at a time. If it rains more than 200 millimeters at a time, if there is a particularly large flood, water damage will still occur. Therefore, while leading the people to achieve great achievements in water conservancy construction, the party and government leading organs of Henan Province pointed out to the people of the province: the elimination of ordinary drought and flood disasters is not the end of water conservancy construction, but only a great beginning of the water conservancy construction movement. In the future, we must continue to move towards the goal of fundamentally controlling water and drought disasters in various rivers. Since the water conservancy construction is not over, how can we say that the work of flood and drought prevention is over?
    Good things and bad things can always be transformed into each other. Building water conservancy can overcome water disasters and irrigate fields, which is a good thing. However, if we think that we can be complacent and paralyzed because we have water conservancy projects, we will inevitably be passive and caught off guard once a major flood arrives. As a result, good things will turn into bad things. This year's agricultural production target is a great leap forward target that people have not dared to imagine for thousands of years. To ensure that this target is fully realized, we should be adequately prepared for all possible disasters, large and small. Strategically despise the enemy, tactically value the enemy, this is Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology for the Chinese revolution. Of course, we don't need to be afraid of the vicious enemy of floods, but only if we watch it and guard against it at all times can we subdue it. Any paralysis and carelessness will disarm us in the face of a possible enemy. Therefore, although the theory of "flood prevention is over" has only just begun to sprout, it should be pointed out and refuted.

    防洪决没有到头
    南村
    在大兴水利之后，最近出现了一种叫做“防洪到头”的新论调。说是水利工程修了那么多，水土保持工程也做了那么多，可以管住洪水了，今年再用不着防洪了。山东菏泽专员公署派人去参加黄河防汛会议，有的同志对此有点不以为然，说“还去开防汛会议啊，水还不够喝的哩”！黄河滞洪区有的县份，几乎把滞洪机关和干部都拉去做其他工作去了。有的同志还说：“群众大搞水利化，我们再提滞洪就要脱离群众！”
    年年在洪水到来之前，都是有各种各样的麻痹思想存在的。看来，今年有麻痹思想的人理由更充足了。的确，经过去冬今春的水利建设高潮，在我们广大的国土上，已经星罗棋布地布满了水利工程；在大部地区，可以说我们已经给洪水设下了天罗地网，洪水来到哪里，我们就可能把它消灭在哪里。可是，我们能够就此认为防洪已经到头了么？当然不能。我们新修起来的水利工程，虽然顶得上百万雄师，但它们毕竟还没有经过洪水的考验，我们怎么就能够事先断定
  “万无一失”了呢？况且，我们的水利建设事业也还远远没有到头。就以水利运动搞得又快又好的河南省来说吧，现在，他们已经基本上实现了水利化，大多数农田已经摆脱了普通水旱灾害的威胁。但是，这还是在一次降雨二百公厘的条件下才能做到，如果一次下雨超过二百公厘，如果遇到特大洪水，也还会发生水害。因此，河南省的党政领导机关，在领导人民取得水利建设的巨大成绩的同时，就向全省人民指出：消灭普通水旱灾害，不是水利建设的终结，而只是水利建设运动的伟大的开端，今后还要继续向根治各河流水旱灾害的目标前进。水利建设事业既然没有到头，防洪防旱的工作怎么就能说已经到头了呢？
    好事和坏事，总是可以互相转化的。修了水利，可以战胜水害，还可以灌溉田地，这是好事。但是，如果以为有了水利工程就有恃无恐，麻痹自满，一旦大的洪水到来，势必陷于被动，措手不及，结果，好事也就变成了坏事。今年的农业生产指标，是几千年来人们不敢设想的大跃进的指标。要保证这个指标全部实现，对一切大大小小的可能发生的灾害，都应当有足够的准备。战略上藐视敌人，战术上重视敌人，这是毛泽东同志对中国革命的指导思想。对于洪水这个凶恶的敌人，我们当然用不着畏惧它，但是，只有我们时时刻刻注视着它，防备着它，我们才有可能制服它。任何麻痹大意，都会使我们在可能到来的敌人面前解除武装。因此，“防洪到头”论虽然才开始萌芽，也要把它指出来，把它驳倒。
