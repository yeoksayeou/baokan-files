Local Areas Can Also Vigorously Develop Scientific Undertakings

    Under the circumstances of the flourishing technological and cultural revolutions, all parts of the country are vying with each other to establish scientific research institutions suitable for local needs. Shaanxi Province is one of the provinces with relatively rapid progress. They broke with convention, "getting started first, handling affairs first," and "working while setting up the framework." In a short period of time, they established the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and seven provincial-level scientific research institutions. They also established scientific research institutes in Liquan, Zhashui, and other counties, and established agricultural scientific research offices in many agricultural cooperatives. Among them, some research institutions have already carried out a lot of work to support industrial and agricultural production.
    In the past, many comrades regarded science and technology as unattainable, believing that scientific research was only a matter for a few experts, and that developing science required sufficient experts and modern equipment. Many scientific workers also mystified science, one-sidedly emphasizing the research of basic theories and modern technologies, and neglecting the research of general production technologies; one-sidedly emphasizing the establishment of modern large-scale research institutions, while not valuing the use of existing human, material, and equipment to establish small and medium-sized research institutions; one-sidedly emphasizing the role of experts, while ignoring the wisdom and talent of the masses. This mystical view of science and the ideas of "regularization" and "academization" hinder the rapid development of science. In fact, science comes from the practice of class struggle and the struggle for production, and there is nothing mysterious about it. The most intelligent and talented people in the world are often those with the most practical experience. Major creations and inventions throughout history, both in China and abroad, have mostly come from people with lower status, less knowledge, and poorer conditions. This is because they have rich practical experience. Now, with the rapid development of socialist construction in our country, scientific teams are forming everywhere. From factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools to rural areas, a group of talents capable of conducting scientific research have emerged. Therefore, the current question is not whether local areas have the conditions to run scientific undertakings, but whether they have the determination to do so. To actively run scientific undertakings, it is necessary to criticize the mystical view of science and right-leaning conservative ideas. We should look downwards, see the wisdom and talent of the masses, see the strength of the masses, see the growth of new forces, and see the huge role of the great leap in production in promoting the development of scientific undertakings. We must believe that scientific work can be done not only in places with many experts, but also in places with few experts; not only in places with good equipment, but also in places with poor equipment; not only in provinces and counties, but also in many townships and communes. Only when local areas vigorously develop scientific undertakings and fully utilize the enthusiasm of local areas and the masses can scientific research develop quickly, well, and economically, and effectively promote the technological revolution.
    The experience of Shaanxi Province shows that to run local scientific undertakings well, it is necessary to put scientific research work at the forefront of production and adhere to the policy of science serving production. That is to say, the task of local scientific research institutions should focus on researching and solving the most urgent problems in local production, while also taking into account the long-term needs of national construction and organizing some research on basic theoretical problems and the latest science and technology in a planned way. The Shaanxi Agricultural Machinery Research Institute is working according to this policy. In just over a month, they have already appraised more than 100 kinds of new agricultural tools for the masses, and in cooperation with Liu Hengjie, the "Living Luban" of Shaanxi, they modified the double-wheeled double-shared plow into a horse-drawn harvester before the wheat harvest. Its traction coefficient is much smaller than that of the United States, making it more practical. It has not only supported this year's summer harvest, but also provided important clues for theoretical research. The reason why they have been able to achieve great results in a relatively short period of time is because their research work is what production needs most and what the masses are most concerned about, and therefore it is strongly supported by the state and the masses. Some comrades think that researching general technical problems in production cannot be regarded as scientific research, which is extremely wrong. Because all scientific research has basically served production directly or indirectly. Researching basic theories and the latest modern science and technology is necessary and important. Neglecting this aspect of work would make it impossible to solve many fundamental problems in natural science and technical science, and impossible to catch up with the most advanced international levels. However, researching the common problems in current production is more in line with the urgent needs of economic construction. Scientific workers can only start from solving the actual problems in current production, constantly absorb the experience and wisdom of the masses, and provide richer content and clues for theoretical research. It can be seen that starting from reality, facing production, and putting scientific research work at the forefront of production should be the correct direction for the development of local scientific work.
    To run local scientific undertakings well, it is necessary to implement the policy of combining experts with the masses. Shaanxi Province has adopted various methods, such as scientific research institutions or universities signing pilot contracts with production units, signing comprehensive cooperation contracts with special districts, counties, and townships; scientific institutions organizing experts to conduct巡回调查 in factories and rural areas; and hiring advanced producers as part-time researchers in scientific institutions. Northwest Agricultural College signed a long-term cooperation contract with the Fenghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liquan County. With the assistance of the college's teachers, the cooperative planted and tested more than 100 new varieties of wheat, and many members learned the techniques of sexual and asexual hybridization of crops, and initially cultivated some promising varieties. Wang Baojing, a nationally renowned labor model, is cooperating with Professor Zhao Hongzhang, the breeder of the famous Bima No. 1 wheat, to carry out intercropping and rotation experiments, striving to achieve a high yield record of 5,500 jin of grain per mu this year. In terms of comprehensive cooperation, Northwest Agricultural College and Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute have signed comprehensive and long-term cooperation contracts with Wugong, Liquan, Qianxian, and Zhouzhi counties, striving for overall bumper harvests of various crops. The Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute is planning to absorb labor models as part-time researchers. The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is organizing experts to adopt 巡回调查 methods to strengthen ties with the masses, so as to promptly study the inventions and creations of the masses, and achieve the goals of understanding, researching, improving, and promoting simultaneously. Due to the adoption of the method of combining experts with the masses, the face of scientific work in Shaanxi has been renewed. In the past, scientific workers had little contact with the masses, and research work was cold and deserted; now, the relationship between scientific workers and the masses has become closer, and the masses have been writing letters or coming to the door, asking to jointly study and solve technical problems in production, and research work has been carried out vigorously. In this way, on the one hand, it can help the masses improve their scientific and cultural level and enable them to quickly master science and technology; on the other hand, it can promote the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants, carry out ideological transformation, and overcome the phenomenon of scientific research work being divorced from reality, divorced from production, and divorced from the masses.
    The development of scientific work in Shaanxi has set an example for local areas to run scientific undertakings. To make our country's scientific work able to adapt to the needs of the leaping development of socialist construction and catch up with the world's most advanced level in the next ten years, it is far from enough to rely solely on the central government, a few research institutions, and a few experts to run scientific undertakings. The correct approach is to rely on both the central government and local areas, and to rely more on the masses than on experts. That is to say, we must walk on two legs, not just one leg. Only by launching a nationwide movement to learn science and run science, making the central and local governments run science simultaneously, large-scale scientific institutions and small and medium-sized scientific institutions run science simultaneously, and vigorously popularizing science under the guidance of key disciplines and the latest technologies, and gradually improving on the basis of popularization, can scientific work be developed rapidly. The era we are in is an era of producing science. Industrial and agricultural production is advancing by leaps and bounds, requiring scientific work to quickly catch up. This requires all parts of the country to vigorously develop scientific undertakings, so that scientific work can flourish all over the vast land of the motherland and bear rich fruits.

    地方也能大办科学事业
    在技术革命和文化革命蓬勃发展的形势下，全国各地争先恐后地开始建立适合当地需要的科学研究机构。陕西省是进展较快的省份之一，他们打破了常规，“先上马、先办事”，“边搭架子边工作”，在很短的时间内就建立了中国科学院陕西分院和七个省一级的科学研究机构，并且在醴泉、柞水等县建立了科学研究所，在不少农业合作社建立了农业科学研究室。其中，有些研究机构已经进行了许多支援工农业生产的工作。
    过去有许多同志把科学技术看得高不可攀，认为科学研究仅仅是少数专家的事情，以为要发展科学就必须有足够的专家和现代化的设备。许多科学工作者也把科学神秘化了，片面地强调基本理论和现代技术的研究，轻视一般生产技术的研究；片面地强调建立现代规模的研究机构，而不重视利用现有的人力、物力和设备，建立中小型的研究机构；片面地强调专家的作用，而忽视了群众的聪明才智。这种对于科学的神秘观念和“正规化”、“学院化”的思想，阻碍着科学事业的迅速发展。实际上，科学来自阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践，并没有什么神秘的地方，世界上最聪明最有才智的人，往往是最有实践经验的人。古今中外的重大创造发明，大都出于地位较低、学问较少、条件较差的人，这就是因为他们有丰富的实践经验。现在，随着我国社会主义建设的迅速发展，各地的科学队伍正在形成，从工厂、企业、机关、学校到农村，都出现了一批能够进行科学研究的人才。因此，当前的问题不是地方上有没有条件办科学事业的问题，而是有没有决心办科学事业的问题。要积极地去办科学事业，就必须批判对于科学的神秘观念和右倾保守思想，应该眼睛向下，看到群众的聪明才智，看到群众的力量，看到新生力量的成长，看到生产大跃进对于促进科学事业发展的巨大作用。要相信：科学工作不仅专家多的地方可以办，专家少的地方也可以办；不仅设备好的地方可以办，设备差的地方也可以办；不仅省和县可以办，许多的乡和社也可以办。只有地方大办科学事业，充分发挥地方和群众的积极性，科学研究工作才能多快好省地发展，才能有力地推动技术革命。
    陕西省的经验表明，要办好地方的科学事业，必须把科学研究工作放在生产的最前线，坚持科学为生产服务的方针。也就是说，地方科学研究机构的任务，应当以研究和解决当地生产上最迫切需要解决的问题为主，同时兼顾国家建设的长远需要，有计划地组织一些基本理论问题和最新科学技术的研究。陕西农业机具研究所就是根据这个方针进行工作的。一个多月以来，他们已经为群众鉴定了一百多种新式农具，并且同陕西的“活鲁班”——刘恒杰合作，在麦收以前，将双轮双铧犁改制成为马拉收割机，它的拉力系数远较美国的小，更加切合实用，不仅支援了今年的夏收，而且为理论研究提供了重要的线索。他们所以能够在较短的时间内取得较大的成绩，就是因为他们的研究工作，是生产上最需要的和群众最关心的，因此也是国家和群众所大力支持的。有些同志以为研究生产中的一般技术问题，不能算作科学研究，这是极其错误的。因为从来的科学研究基本上都是直接或间接为生产服务的。研究基本理论和现代最新科学技术是必需的和重要的，忽视了这方面的工作就不可能解决自然科学和技术科学中的许多根本问题，不可能赶上最先进的国际水平，而研究当前生产中普遍存在的问题却更加合乎经济建设的迫切需要。科学工作者只有从解决当前生产中的实际问题入手，不断地吸取群众的经验和智慧，才能为理论研究提供更加丰富的内容和线索。由此可见，从实际出发，面向生产，把科学研究工作放在生产的最前线，应当是地方科学工作发展的正确方向。
    要办好地方的科学事业，必须贯彻专家同群众相结合的方针。陕西省采取了由科学研究机关或高等学校同生产单位订立试点合同，同专区、县、乡订立全面协作合同；由科学机关组织专家到工厂、农村巡回调查；聘请先进生产者担任科学机关的兼职研究人员等多种方式。西北农学院同醴泉县烽火农业生产合作社订立了长期的协作合同，在农学院教师的协助下，社里种植试验了一百多种小麦新品种，许多社员都学会了进行作物有性杂交和无性杂交的技术，初步培育出一些有希望的品种。全国著名的劳动模范王保京同著名的碧玛一号小麦培育者赵洪璋教授合作，正在进行着套种轮作试验，争取今年达到亩产粮食五千五百斤的高产纪录。在面的协作方面，西北农学院和西北农业科学研究所已经分别同武功、醴泉、乾县、盩厔等县订立了全面的、长期的协作合同，争取各种作物全面丰产。西北农业科学研究所正在有计划地吸收劳动模范作为兼职研究员。科学院陕西分院正在组织专家采取巡回调查的方法，加强同群众的联系，以便及时研究群众的发明创造，作到边了解、边研究、边改进、边推广。由于采取了专家同群众相结合的方法，陕西科学工作的面貌为之一新。过去，科学工作者同群众很少联系，研究工作冷冷清清；现在，科学工作者同群众的关系密切了，群众纷纷来信，或者找上门来，要求共同研究和解决生产中的技术问题，研究工作就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。这样，一方面可以帮助群众提高科学文化水平，使他们迅速地掌握科学技术；另一方面又可以推动知识分子同工农群众结合，进行思想改造，克服科学研究工作脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离群众的现象。
    陕西科学工作的发展，已经为地方办科学事业树立了一个榜样。要使我国的科学工作能够适应社会主义建设飞跃发展的需要，并且在今后十年内赶上世界最先进的水平，仅仅依靠中央、依靠少数研究机构和少数专家办科学事业是远远不够的。正确的作法是：既要靠中央，也要靠地方，既要靠专家，更要靠群众。就是说，要两条腿走路，而不是一条腿走路。只有掀起一个全民学科学、全国办科学的运动，作到中央和地方办科学同时并举，大型科学机构同中小型科学机构同时并举，并且在重点学科和最新技术的指导下大力普及，在普及的基础上逐步提高，科学工作才能够得到迅速的发展。我们所处的时代，是一个出科学的时代。工农业生产万马奔腾地向前跃进，要求科学工作迅速跟上来。这就要求各地都要大办科学事业，让科学工作在祖国广阔的土地上遍地开花，并且结出丰硕的果实来。
