    Oil-Impregnated Bearings

    Oil-impregnated bearings are manufactured using powder metallurgy. They are porous, sponge-like structures, with the fine pores in the middle interconnected by capillary action and directly accessible to the surface. During use, as the shaft rotates within the bearing, a semi-vacuum state is created on the contact point between the shaft and the bearing, drawing the oil stored within the sponge through capillary action to the bearing surface, lubricating the friction surfaces of the shaft and bearing. When the shaft starts rotating, the metallic friction at the contact point causes the bearing to heat up and expand. However, because the volume expansion coefficient of oil is greater than that of metal, it can push the oil from the sponge to the bearing surface, lubricating the friction surface. After the shaft stops rotating, the bearing temperature gradually decreases, and the oil on the surface is re-absorbed into the sponge. Therefore, it is also known as a self-lubricating bearing.

    The invention of oil-impregnated bearings is over a decade old. The Soviet Union, the United States, Germany, and Japan are all researching the expansion of their applications. The Soviet Union is currently studying their use in 20-kilowatt electric motors, machine tools, automobiles, tractors, diesel engines, textile machinery, and agricultural machinery, among other areas. Currently, there are two main methods for manufacturing oil-impregnated bearings worldwide: one uses bronze as a raw material to produce bronze oil-impregnated bearings, and the other uses iron scale and graphite as raw materials to produce iron-graphite oil-impregnated bearings. The North China Radio Equipment Factory is currently trial-producing the latter. (Han Fenglin)

    含油轴承
    含油轴承是用粉末冶金法制造的。它是多孔性海绵体状，中间的细孔、借毛细管作用相互连通，可直通表面。在使用的时候，由于轴在轴承中旋转，而使轴和轴承接触点的一面，呈半真空状态，从而将海绵体内贮藏的油，经毛细管作用而吸至轴承表面，润滑轴和轴承的摩擦面。轴开始转动的时候，由于接触处金属摩擦的结果，使轴承发热而膨胀，但因油的体积膨胀系数比金属大，能把海绵体中的油压到轴承表面，润滑摩擦面，轴停止转动后，轴承温度逐渐下降，表面的油就重新被吸入海绵体内。所以又称为自动润滑轴承。
    含油轴承的发明已有十多年历史，苏联、美国、德国和日本等都在研究扩大利用范围；苏联正在研究把它用于二十瓩的电动机、机床、汽车、拖拉机、柴油机、纺织机械和农业机械等各方面。目前世界上制造含油轴承的方法大体上有两种，一是用青铜作原料的青铜含油轴承，一是用氧化铁皮和石墨作原料的铁石墨含油轴承；华北无线电器材厂现在试制的是后一种。（韩凤麟）
