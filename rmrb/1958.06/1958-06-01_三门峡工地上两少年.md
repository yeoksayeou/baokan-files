　　Two Youngsters at the Sanmenxia Construction Site
　　Chen Bochui
    Night deepened, but the Sanmenxia Reservoir construction site became brighter and brighter, the lights shining as if it were daytime.
    The wind blowing down from the upper reaches of the Yellow River was cool. But most of the people working intensely only wore a single shirt.
    We crossed the pontoon bridge built on the Shenmen Island and arrived at the left bank construction site. Walking along, watching, watching, we unknowingly went from the blasting and slag removal section to the pouring section.
    The active image of a young man leaped into my eyes: He carried a lead bucket, filled with mud slurry, leaped out of the stone pit, and ran to the far-off excavated ditch head. With a lift of his hand, he poured it all out cleanly, then ran back, jumping into the pit. A moment later, he jumped out again, full of energy, and doing the work skillfully.
    I stood at the ditch head to wait for him.
    He ran over, glanced at me, and before I could speak, he asked, "Are you here to visit?"
    "Yes. From Beijing."
    The words "Beijing" seemed to shock him like electricity, his eyes flashing with joy.
    "Welcome!"
    "Thank you, you must be working hard." I immediately asked, "Where are you from?"
    "My home is in Mengjin. I came here after graduating from elementary school last summer."
    I smiled. "Did you fail the entrance exam for junior high school? Or..."
    He interrupted me. "No. I wanted to support Sanmenxia!"
    "You wanted to support Sanmenxia?"
    "Why not?" He bit his teeth, his big eyes shining even brighter. "This time, we must eradicate the old roots of the Yellow River disaster!"
    I nodded. "What kind of work do you do?"
    He lowered his head, and his voice lowered as well. "I'm just an apprentice now. I do whatever work the squad leader assigns me. Now I'm pouring out dirty water bucket by bucket." He paused here, then raised his voice again and said, "You need to know that before each piece of land is poured, you must first clean the foundation, this is detailed work. – We must guarantee quality!"
    I couldn't help but pat him on the shoulder, "You're right. Any work here is important work."
    "Oh! Sorry, I have to hurry and get some mud slurry."
    He picked up the lead bucket and ran. Suddenly he turned his head and shouted innocently, "Goodbye! – My name is Li Kaijia."
    The very next day, we walked down from the concrete mixing building towering on the right bank, bypassed the area where the "landslide" [Note] was being repaired, and walked along the winding mountain road. A bell rang, and looking at my watch, it was exactly five o'clock in the afternoon, the time for the early and late shifts to change over.
    Although the sun was setting in the west, the valley was hot and stuffy. Everyone who had just finished work was exhausted and sweating profusely, constantly waving their willow twig woven safety helmets, and hurrying back. But a group of people stopped ahead, and a road was being built down the slope for automobiles.
    A bulldozer roared rumblingly, smoothly leveling pile after pile of sand and soil, but then difficulties arose.
    Driving this bulldozer was a fifteen or sixteen year old girl. She held the rudder wheel, pushed and pulled the control lever, and aimed at a jagged rock, pushing against it, but it wouldn't budge; the bulldozer backed away. She pulled a mechanism to lower the blade in front, the rear of the machine tilted up, pushing obliquely against it, the rock moved a little, but still didn't fall. She pulled the mechanism again, tilted the front of the machine back, lowered the blade further, and pushed forward again... in this way, advancing and retreating, retreating and advancing three or four times. She was determined to remove the stumbling block on the road ahead. Although it was well past quitting time, she didn't want to leave the difficulty to others. The beads of sweat on her forehead ran down her cheeks to her chin. Suddenly, with a thud, the rock fell, and was pushed aside along with the sand and soil.
    The girl braked, jumped out lightly, lifted the corner of her shirt and wiped her face, smiled and welcomed the comrade taking over, waved her hand, and stepped up the slope.
    I quickly went to greet her. "Little comrade, you drive the bulldozer well, when did you learn?"
    She was stunned for a moment, then smiled and replied, "Not so good. I've only been learning for more than half a year, as an assistant."
    "This work is quite laborious, do you like doing it?"
    "I like it very much!" She smiled, squinting her eyes. "When I was in elementary school, I read about tractors and liked them; later, I was admitted to a technical school and assigned to the tractor class, and I was so happy that I couldn't sleep at night, I couldn't wait to learn it well in one breath. Last year, I came to this construction site, working and learning, and with the help of experienced masters, I can drive a bulldozer."
    "Why didn't you go to junior high school?"
    "There are also two younger brothers and two younger sisters at home, and there are economic difficulties, so I didn't finish technical school, and I asked to come here."
    "Did your dad and mom agree?"
    "Dad didn't say anything; Mom didn't agree, saying that girls couldn't do this work."
    "Then how did you come?"
    "Debate! – Mom lost and was convinced." She raised her eyebrows, her face filled with a victorious smile. "She loves me, she can only let me come."
      "Great! You, this young successor, are making a great leap forward, taking over early." Suddenly it occurred to me, "Do you miss home? How many times have you gone home?"
      "No, not once. Our team has put forward a resolution, we will not go home until the reservoir is repaired. – I just send some money back every month."
    "Do you have any plans for yourself?"
    "Yes." She glanced at the large construction site across the river, "Through the construction of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, improve myself, hoping to reach the second-level worker in terms of technology; and reach the junior high school level in terms of culture."
    I admired this girl, and at the same time was happy for her. "You can do it. It will be very glorious when you go home at that time, to be a tractor driver in the commune –"
    "No, no," she blocked my words. "I have to keep working. We have all discussed that after this project is completed, we will go to the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to build a reservoir. – Haven't you heard of it?"
    "I've heard of it." I suddenly felt that the person standing in front of me was a tall female comrade, her excellent qualities and beautiful wisdom were much taller than her stature.
    She thought my silence was doubt, and added two sentences: "I came from the Guanting Reservoir. – We have already sworn that we will only be finished when we have repaired all the reservoirs in the country."
    "Ah–" I couldn't speak as if I had suddenly been startled.
    "Look, they are waiting for me. Goodbye!" She said, stepping lightly up the slope.
    Three young people were still standing on the hilltop, two of whom were women. I couldn't help but say to myself, "Socialism gives people ideas, gives people strength, and gives people confidence!"
    The matter had passed a month and a half, but the faces of the two young people were always so clear, I could see them as soon as I closed my eyes. Perhaps the people who love labor most in the world are the most lovable people, and the image of labor is the most beautiful image.

　　三门峡工地上两少年
　　陈伯吹
    夜深了，三门峡水库工地上却愈来愈亮，灯光照耀得如同白昼。
    从黄河上游刮下来的风，凉飕飕的。可是干活紧张的人，大多数只披一件单衫。
    我们跨过了架在神门岛上的便桥，到了左岸工地上，一路走过去，看着，看着，不知不觉地从爆破出碴的工段，到了浇筑的工段来了。
    一个少年的活跃的形象，跳进了我眼睛里：他提着铅皮桶，盛满了泥浆水，从石坑里蹦出来，飞奔到老远开挖的沟头那里，一抬手，就倒个干净，又奔了回来，纵身跳落在坑里。一会儿却又蹦了出来，干劲挺足，活儿干得也挺熟练。
    我站到沟头去等他。
    他奔过来了，盯了我一眼，没让我开口，倒先问了。“你们可是来参观的？”
    “是的。从北京来。”
    “北京”两个字像电一样地触着了他，眼睛里闪着喜悦的光采。
    “欢迎！”
    “谢谢，你们可辛苦了。”我紧接着问：“你从哪儿来的？”
    “家在孟津。去年暑假小学毕业了就上这儿来。”
    我微笑着。“是没考上初中？还是……”
    他打断了我的话。“不是。是我要支援三门峡！”
    “你要支援三门峡？”
    “为什么不？”他咬了咬牙齿，一双大眼睛更加发亮了。“这一回，一定要把那黄河灾难的老根拔掉！”
    我点点头。“你干什么活儿的？”
    他低下头，声音也放低了。“我现在只是个徒工。班长分配什么工作我都干。现在我一桶一桶的倒掉脏水。”话到这儿顿住了，随后又提高了嗓门说：“您要知道，每一方地在浇灌之前，先要把底子洗干净，这是细致的工作。——得保证质量！”
    我禁不住拍拍他的肩膀，“你说得对。这儿的不论什么工作，都是重要的工作。”
    “啊呀！对不起，我得赶快去提泥浆水啦。”
    他提起铅皮桶就跑。忽然转过头来，天真地喊着：“再见！——我叫李开甲。”
    就在下一天，我们从高耸在右岸的混凝土小拌合楼旁边走下来，绕过了整修“滑坡”〔注〕的地方，在弯来弯去的山路上走着。一阵钟声响了，看手表，正是下午五点钟整，是到了早、午班交替的时候了。
    太阳虽然西斜，峡谷里热烘烘的，刚下班的谁都累得满头大汗，不停地挥着柳条儿编织的安全帽，急匆匆地赶回去。可是有一堆人在前面停住了，坡下面正在赶筑一条汽车路。
    一台推土机轧轧轧的吼着，一堆又一堆的砂土顺利地给铲平，可是困难也就来了。
    驾驶这台推土机的是个十五、六岁的小姑娘。她把着舵轮，推着、拉着操纵杆，对准着一块头角峥嵘的岩石推过去，不成；推土机退了回来。她一拉机件，把前面的刀片放低些，机身后部翘了起来，倾斜地推过去，岩石动了一动，还是没倒下来。她又一拉机件，翘着机头退了回去，把刀片放得更低一些，再推向前去……这样地三番四次地进了又退，退了又进。她决心铲除前进道路上的绊石，虽然已经早过了下班时间，可是她不愿意把困难留给别人，自己额角上的汗珠，顺着脸颊直挂到颔下。忽然轰隆地一声，岩石倒了，和砂土一块儿被推到旁边去。
    小姑娘煞了车，轻轻跳下来，撩起衣角擦了擦脸，笑迎着接班的同志，挥了挥手，迈上坡来。
    我赶快迎了上去。“小同志，你推土机开得不坏，什么时候学会的？”
    她楞了一下，笑着回答：“不怎么样。才学了半年多，当助手。”
    “这活儿怪费劲，你喜欢干？”
    “太喜欢！”她笑得眯缝了眼睛。“我在小学念书的时候，读到拖拉机，就喜欢它；后来考上技工学校，分配在拖拉机班，高兴得夜里睡不着觉，恨不得一口气就学好它。去年来到这工地上，干活带学习，得到老师傅的帮助，能开推土机了。”
    “你干嘛不升初中？”
    “家里还有两个弟弟和两个妹妹，经济上有困难，所以技工学校没读完，我就要求上这边来了。”
    “你爹和妈都同意？”
    “爹没吭声；妈不同意，说这活儿姑娘们干不了。”
    “那你怎么来的？”
    “辩论啊！——妈输了，给说服了。”她扬了扬眉毛，胜利的笑容堆满了紫堂堂的脸。“她疼我，她只能让我来。”
      “多棒！你这个少年接班人大跃进，提早接班了。”忽然我想起来了，“你想家吗？回家几次了？”
      “不，一次也没有。咱们班提出了决心书，不修好水库不回家。——我只是每月寄点钱回去。”
    “你自己有什么规划没有？”
    “有。”她向对岸一大片工地瞥了一眼，“通过建筑三门峡水库，提高自己，希望技术方面达到二级工；文化方面达到初中程度。”
    我佩服这个姑娘，一边替她高兴。“你做得到。那时候你回家去多光荣，好在社里当拖拉机手——”
    “不，不，”她堵住了我的话。“我还得干下去。咱们大伙儿已经谈过，这儿完了工，就上长江三峡去修水库。——你没听说过吗？”
    “听说过。”我突然觉得站在我面前的是个高大的女同志，她那优秀的品质，美丽的智慧，比她身材高得多呢。
    她以为我的沉默是在怀疑，还补充了两句：“我就是从官厅水库来的。——咱们已经宣誓，要修完了全国所有的水库才算数。”
    “啊——”我像突然受惊似的说不出话来了。
    “您瞧，他们在等着我呢。再见！”她说着轻快地迈上坡去。
    山头上还站着三个年轻人，其中两个是女的。我不觉自语着：“社会主义给人思想，给人力量，给人信心！”
    事情已经隔了一个半月，可是两个少年人的面貌，老是这么清晰的，一闭眼就看见了。大概世界上爱劳动的人是最可爱的人，劳动的形象是最美丽的形象吧。
