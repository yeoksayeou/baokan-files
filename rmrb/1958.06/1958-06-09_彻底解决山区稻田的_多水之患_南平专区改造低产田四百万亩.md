Completely Solving the "Excessive Water Problem" in Mountainous Paddy Fields
Nanping Prefecture Transforms Four Million Mu of Low-Yielding Land

    (Our report) Fuzhou, Fujian Province - Nanping Prefecture, Fujian Province, through a mass "Three Reforms" movement – changing serial irrigation to rotational irrigation, improving rotten mud fields, and improving cold water fields – has thoroughly solved the "excessive water problem" that had never been resolved in southern mountainous paddy fields. The 4.35 million mu of improved paddy fields in the entire prefecture have basically changed from a low-yielding state and are gradually moving towards the ranks of high-yielding fields.

    Nanping Prefecture is located in a mountainous area with an annual rainfall of about 1,700 to 2,000 millimeters. Mountain streams and springs flow continuously throughout the year, and paddy fields are constantly irrigated in series and overflow. Especially during the spring and summer seasons, mountain floods inundate the fields, often washing away fertilizers, soil, and seedlings, resulting in increasingly barren soil. The field water is both cold and deep, and the water and soil temperatures are very low. Serial irrigation fields account for 3.48 million mu. Due to the constant flow of spring water and long-term erosion by groundwater, the soil structure has been damaged, resulting in 580,000 mu of rotten mud fields. In addition, there are 600,000 mu of cold water fields where underground spring water constantly seeps upward, causing the field water to be warm in winter and cold in summer. These serial irrigation, rotten mud, and cold water fields total 4.66 million mu, accounting for 77% of the total paddy fields. Most of these paddy fields can only yield one harvest a year, with a unit yield generally below 200 jin per mu, which is 40-50% lower than the yield of ordinary paddy fields.

    The fundamental cause of serial irrigation, rotten mud, and cold water fields is extensive cultivation and the lack of drainage and irrigation systems in the paddy fields. In the struggle against nature, the broad masses have created experiences in opening ditches to drain mountain floods, lowering the groundwater level, and diverting spring and cold water to achieve increased production. The partial promotion of the "Three Reforms" in the past few years since cooperativization has proven that changing serial irrigation to rotational irrigation, improving rotten mud fields, and improving cold water fields is indeed an effective measure to increase production. From the 590,000 mu of fields "Three Reformed" after cooperativization in the district, yields generally increased by about 20-30% that year. The 200,000 mu that were reformed last year increased the average yield per mu from 202 jin to 251 jin, an increase of 24%. The highest increase was about 50%.

    After the emergence of the great leap forward situation last winter and this spring, the Nanping Prefectural Party Committee, based on the local natural conditions, timely proposed the fighting call to "Defeat Serial Irrigation and March Towards Low-Yielding Fields." Many townships and communes also put forward the slogan "Change the Constant Flow of Water and Achieve Double Harvests in Paddy Fields." At the same time, a great debate was launched throughout the district on whether the "Three Reforms" were necessary, good, and worthwhile. After the masses' enthusiasm was boosted, the Prefectural Party Committee emphasized that cadres at all levels should conduct experiments. The secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees shouldered their hoes and marched towards the mountains, leading more than 20,000 cadres above the township level (accounting for more than 90% of the total) to join 300,000 people in the "Three Reforms" movement, focusing on changing serial irrigation.

    After one hundred days of hard work, nearly ten million workdays were spent, hundreds of thousands of small drainage ditches, irrigation canals, and branch canals were built, and tens of thousands of spring eyes of cold water were diverted. 3.76 million mu of serial irrigation, rotten mud, and cold water fields were improved, accounting for 92.38% of the number that should have been improved, initially overcoming the "excessive water problem." At the same time, combined with the "Three Reforms", 150 to 200 dan of fertilizer per mu was applied to improve more than 1.7 million mu of soil, greatly increasing the organic matter in the mountain fields, laying a solid foundation for thoroughly realizing the transformation of low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields.

    After Nanping Prefecture basically realized rotational irrigation, the natural landscape of the land has been changed, and the phenomenon of fertilizer and soil erosion and increasingly barren soil has been stopped. Due to the increase in water and soil temperatures after the "Three Reforms," transplanting seedlings this year was a solar term earlier than last year, and the seedlings turned green many days faster than in the past, thus creating conditions suitable for the normal growth of double-cropping rice. This year, the entire district has promoted 700,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the mountains. (Li Guicheng)

### 彻底解决山区稻田的“多水之患”  南平专区改造低产田四百万亩

    彻底解决山区稻田的“多水之患”
    南平专区改造低产田四百万亩
    本报讯　福建省南平专区通过全民性的改串灌为轮灌、改良烂泥田、改良冷水田的“三改”运动，彻底解决了南方山区稻田所未曾解决的“水多之患”，全区四百三十五万亩经过改良的稻田，已经基本上改变低产状况，逐步迈向高产田之列。
    南平专区地处山区，年雨量在一千七百至二千公厘左右。山涧泉水四季不断，稻田常年串灌漫流，特别是每逢春夏两季，山洪漫田而过，经常漂走肥料、土壤和秧苗，以致土质日益瘠瘦，田水既冷又深，水温地温很低，这种串灌田有三百四十八万亩。由于泉水常年串流不息，加上地下水长期浸蚀，破坏了土壤的结构，造成了土质稀烂的烂泥田五十八万亩。此外，还有地下泉水不断上冒，造成田水冬暖夏寒的冷水田六十万亩。这种串灌、烂泥、冷水田全区共四百六十六万亩，占稻田总数77％。这些稻田绝大部分一年只能一熟，粮食单位产量亩产一般在二百斤以下，比一般稻田产量低四、五成。
    造成串灌、烂泥、冷水田的根本原因是耕作粗放，稻田缺乏排水灌水系统所致。广大群众在向自然作斗争中，曾经创造了开沟排除山洪、降低地下水位、导出泉水冷水而获得增产的经验。合作化后几年来部分推广的事实证明，改变串灌为轮灌、改良烂泥田、改良冷水田确实是增产的一项有效措施。从该区合作化以后“三改”的五十九万亩田看，当年一般都增产二、三成左右，去年所改的二十万亩，平均亩产由二百零二斤提高到二百五十一斤，增产二成四。最高增产达五成左右。
    去冬今春全民大跃进形势出现后，南平地委根据当地自然条件，及时提出了“战胜串灌漫流，向低产田大进军”的战斗号召，许多乡、社也提出了“改变水长流，要稻田双收”的口号。同时，在全区范围内展开了“三改”要不要、好不好、合不合算等问题的大辩论。当群众劲头鼓足以后，地委又强调各级干部搞试验，地、县委书记扛起锄头向山垅进军，带动了乡以上的干部二万多人（占总数90％以上）与三十万群众并肩投入以改串灌为主的“三改”运动。
    经过一百天的苦干猛干，做了近一千万个劳动日，修筑了数十万条小型的排水沟、灌溉渠、斗毛渠，以及引出了成千成万处泉眼的冷水，改良了串灌、烂泥、冷水田三百七十六万亩，占应改数的92.38％，初步战胜了“多水之患”。与此同时，结合“三改”，每亩下肥一百五十到二百担，改良了土壤一百七十多万亩，使山垅田大量增加了有机质，为彻底实现低产田变高产田打下了巩固的基础。
    南平专区基本实现轮灌化后，已经改变了土地的自然面貌，制止了肥土冲失、土壤日益瘠瘦的现象；由于“三改”后水温地温提高，今年插秧比去年提早了一个节气，秧苗转青也比过去快好多天，因而创造了适应双季稻正常生长的条件，全区今年就推广了七十万亩双季稻上山。　　　　　（李桂成）
