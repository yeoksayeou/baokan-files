Heat and Heatstroke
    Xiao Yu
    Animals have a certain limit to their heat tolerance. For example, frogs are most comfortable in hot weather, but if you put them in water that is 104 degrees Fahrenheit, they will become limp. Rabbits, in hot weather of 122 degrees Fahrenheit, will suffer from heatstroke just like humans. We humans have a higher tolerance for heat, at least able to withstand high heat of 130 degrees Fahrenheit; some can even withstand 240 degrees Fahrenheit for a short period.

    We humans are like steam engines, constantly adding fuel – food – and with work and activity, the body is constantly producing heat. If we calculate the body's heat production over 24 hours, the total is as high as 2,400 to 2,700 kilocalories (this amount of heat is enough to bring 540 pounds of cold water to a boil). The body cannot allow so much heat to accumulate and must dissipate it at all times. There are two main ways to dissipate heat: First, when the air temperature is below 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the body's heat production is not particularly high, the heat will dissipate into the air on its own. This is the same principle as how a cup of hot tea cools down after being left for a while. Second, if the air temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, or if working in a high-temperature workshop, or doing heavy labor, then in addition to relying on the first method of heat dissipation, one must also rely on sweating. Sweating profusely, every two pounds of sweat can lower body temperature by 22 degrees (Fahrenheit).

    This regulation of the body is mainly controlled by the central nervous system. Once the regulation fails, or if other problems arise, the heat in the body cannot be dissipated and accumulates more and more, heatstroke will occur. Heatstroke can manifest in approximately the following categories:

    The most common type is "heat syncope." People who are weak, in too hot an environment, first feel heavy-headed, cannot support themselves, then become pale, have a weak pulse, and cold skin, and suddenly fall to the ground. At this time, they should be moved to a cool, ventilated place, their buttons unbuttoned, and allowed to rest quietly for a while, and they will recover. If their body is cold, a warm towel can be used to wipe their body. This type of heatstroke is mostly not life-threatening.

    One type of heatstroke is caused by sun exposure. The ultraviolet rays and high temperature of the sun can cause illness. Symptoms include pain in the forehead and temples, a hot body, no sweating on the skin, nausea, and incoherent speech. People who work outdoors are more likely to get this disease. At this time, they should immediately be helped to lie down in a cool, breezy place, and apply a cold water towel (well water is cooler) to their head, and let them drink some cool, strong tea. If they are mentally disturbed, it is best to call a doctor. This type of heatstroke will recover to health after a few days of rest.

    A more severe type of heatstroke is high-fever heatstroke. Patients mostly first feel dizzy, chest tightness, nausea, dry mouth, fear of sunlight, no sweating, and frequent urination. Later, the symptoms worsen, the pulse beats fast, first mental disturbance, then coma. Touching their body, it is scalding hot, the body temperature rises higher and higher, all above 41 or 42 degrees (Celsius). At this time, they must be quickly moved to a cool place, their clothes removed, and their body fanned, and cold water poured on their head and body, even white liquor (strong liquor) applied to their body, or ice used to cool their body and head. Then they must be sent to the hospital immediately so that various methods can be used to lower their body temperature.

    Another more severe type of heatstroke is "intestinal spasm." Patients mostly have dizziness, nausea, paleness, cold sweats, little urine, dry mouth, no fever, and especially severe cramping in the abdominal muscles and calf muscles. At this time, they should be allowed to rest in a cool place and given warm salt water to drink (because intestinal spasm occurs due to high fever, excessive sweating, and too little salt in the body). Then immediately transport them to the hospital, where a doctor will directly infuse saline into their blood vessels.

    Perhaps some people will have this question: On a hot day, it's not just a few people who are hot, why is it only a few people who suffer from heatstroke? It turns out that the occurrence of heatstroke is not only because of the hot weather, but also because of other factors combined, in addition to the person's physical strength.

    For example, when the air is humid and not ventilated, it is most difficult for the body to sweat, and it is most likely to suffer from heatstroke. In an extremely humid environment, even if the air temperature is only 90 degrees Fahrenheit, people will not be able to bear it, and may even die. However, in a ventilated and dry environment, even if the air temperature reaches 260 degrees Fahrenheit, people can tolerate it. It seems that we should pay attention to the ventilation of houses. In the old days, women in confinement had to avoid the wind in hot weather, and many women sacrificed their lives because of this, which is worth noting.

    Secondly, people who are exposed to strong ultraviolet and infrared radiation can also suffer from heatstroke. Therefore, people who work outdoors should wear straw hats, light-colored clothes, and avoid sun exposure.

    People who sweat a lot must drink more water and replenish salt. If the body is deficient in water and salt, it is also easy to suffer from heatstroke. Drinking salt tea (not necessarily too salty) after sweating is very helpful.

    When working in hot weather, you should arrange more rest periods appropriately. Working for five or six hours in a row will increase the chances of heatstroke.

    Furthermore, lack of sleep, poor appetite, inappropriate diet, or drinking too much alcohol can also easily lead to heatstroke.

    In addition, people who are weak are also prone to heatstroke. In particular, people with an unsound cardiovascular system and obese people often cannot withstand the heat and have difficulty dissipating heat. Special care should be taken for them.

    热和中暑
    小雨
    动物对于热的耐受，都有一定限度。譬如青蛙，热天是它最得意的时候，可是如果把它放进华氏一百零四度的水里，那它就会软瘫过去。兔子在华氏一百二十二度的热天气里，就会像人一样地中暑。我们人对热的耐受力量比较高，起码能挡得住华氏一百三十度的高热；有的甚至在华氏二百四十度的时候，还能支撑一个短时间。
    我们人像架蒸气机，经常不断的在添加燃料——食物，再加上工作、活动，身体就无时不在产生热量。如果把身体二十四小时的产热量计算一下，总数高达二千四百至二千七百大卡（这个热量足可以把五百四十斤冷水热得沸腾）。身体不允许有那么多的热量积存着，得随时把它们散出去。散热的办法主要有二种：一、气温在华氏九十度以内，身体产热又不特别多，那么，热就会自己散入空气。这道理同一杯热茶静置片刻能变凉是一样的。二、如果气温高过华氏九十度，或者在高温车间工作，或者干着吃重的劳动，这时候除了靠第一种办法散热外，还得靠出汗。挥汗如雨的时候，每出二斤汗，就能降低体温二十二度（华氏）。
    身体的这种调节，主要由中枢神经来掌握。一旦调节失灵，或者出了别的问题，身体里的热散不出去，越积越多，就会出现中暑现象。中暑的情形大约有以下几类：
    最普通的一类是“热晕”。体弱的人，在太热的场合下，先是觉着头重，支持不住，接着就面白，脉细，皮肤发凉，忽的一下就倒在地上。这时候应该把他抬到荫凉通风的地方，解开他的衣扣，让他静静的休息一会，他就会缓过来。如果他身子发冷，可用温手巾擦他身子。这种中暑，多半不会有性命之忧。
    有一类中暑是太阳晒出来的。太阳光中的紫外线和高热的气温，能使人发病。病状是脑门和太阳穴发痛，身子发烫，皮面不出汗，想吐，说昏话。野外工作的人，得这病比较多。这时候应该立刻把他扶到凉爽有风的地方躺下，在他头上敷冷水毛巾（井水比较凉），让他喝些凉的浓茶。如果他神智不安，就最好请医生。这种中暑，休息几天，就会恢复健康的。
    有一类高热型中暑比较厉害。患者多半已先感到头脑昏昏沉沉，胸口发堵，恶心，口干，怕见阳光，不出汗，尿的次数多。以后，症状加重，脉跳得快，先是神智不安，接着就昏迷。摸摸他的身子，烫手得厉害，体温越升越高，都在四十一、二度（摄氏）以上。这时候，得赶紧搬他到凉快的地方，脱去他衣服，用扇搧他身子，用凉水浇他头和身子，甚至用白干酒（烧酒）涂他身子，或者用冰镇他的身子和头。然后要立刻送他到医院去，以便用各种办法来降低他的体温。
    还有一类比较厉害的中暑是得“绞肠痧”。患者大都头晕，恶心，面白，出冷汗，尿少，口干，不发烧，特出的是肚子上的肉和腿肚抽痉，抽得很厉害。这时候，应该让他在凉处休息，给他喝温盐水（因为绞肠痧的发生，是高热、出汗过多、体内盐份太少的缘故）。然后立即抬送医院，由医生从他血管直接输入盐水。
    也许有人会产生这样的疑问：大热天不止热着几个人，为什么中暑的只是少数的人呢？原来中暑的发生，不光是因为天气热，除了人的身体强弱外，还有别的一些因素凑在一起。
    譬如，空气潮湿又不通风的时候，身体出汗最困难，也最容易中暑。在湿度极大的环境里，即使气温只有华氏九十度，人也会受不了，甚至死亡。可是，在通风而又干燥的情况下，即使气温达到华氏二百六十度，人也能忍受。这么看来，我们应当注意房子的通风。旧法产妇在热天都须避风，不少产妇因此牺牲，这是值得注意的。
    其次，人受到强烈的紫外线和红外线的照射，也会中暑。所以户外劳动的人最好戴草帽，穿浅色衣服，少晒太阳。
    出汗多的人，一定要多喝水多补盐。身体里水和盐不足，也容易中暑。出汗之后喝盐茶（不必太咸），很有作用。
    在大热天劳动，应适当的多安排几次休息。连着五、六小时劳动，中暑的机会就要增加。
    再有，睡眠不足，胃口不开，饮食不适当，或者多喝了些酒，也容易中暑。
    另外，身体弱，也容易中暑。尤其是心脏系统不怎么健全和肥胖的人，往往经不住热，也很难散热。对于他们，应该加以特别的照顾。
