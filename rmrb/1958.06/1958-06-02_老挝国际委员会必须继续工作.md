The International Commission for Laos Must Continue to Work
Commentator of this newspaper

　　After Laos achieved national peace and unity and established a coalition government, supplementary elections were held on May 4. This is a major achievement in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. It is the result of the joint efforts of both the Royal Lao Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces. In this regard, the International Commission for Laos has made positive contributions. This fact also fully demonstrates the positive and important role played by the International Commission in the implementation of the agreements in the countries of Indochina. Now, people are eagerly anticipating the three International Commissions of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to continue to play their due roles in promoting the full implementation of the Geneva Accords and the further consolidation of peace in Indochina, but proposals have emerged to cease the activities of the International Commission for Laos. We cannot but express our deep concern about this. We believe that such proposals are contrary to the interests of peace in Indochina and violate the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords. We fully agree with the statement made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 31 regarding this issue; it is absolutely necessary to retain the International Commission for Laos.

　　First, the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos still requires the continued supervision of the International Commission for Laos. Acts of retaliation and discrimination in violation of Article 15 of the agreement continue to occur. The political settlement stipulated in Article 14 of the agreement has not yet been achieved. The tasks of the International Commission for Laos as stipulated in the Geneva Accords have not yet been completed, and there is no reason to cease the activities of this commission at this time.

　　Second, peace in Laos has not yet been consolidated. U.S. imperialism is currently exerting various pressures and engaging in conspiratorial activities, intensifying its interference in Laos, posing a threat to the peace of Laos and the entire Indochina region. Recently, the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department even openly expressed "serious concern" about the supplementary elections held in Laos on May 4. The U.S. government is also using U.S. "aid" as a means of blackmail and extortion against Laos, conspiring to undermine Laos' peace and neutrality, and is in fact continuing its sinful activities of sabotaging the implementation of the Geneva Accords. Under these circumstances, the International Commission for Laos bears an unshirkable major responsibility; the continued existence and active and conscientious work of the commission are absolutely necessary.

　　The existence or non-existence of the International Commission for Laos cannot be treated in isolation based solely on the situation in Laos. The discussions at the Geneva Conference in 1954 clearly recognized that peace in Indochina is indivisible; the spirit of the final declaration of the conference, especially Articles 4 and 5, also affirmed this principle. Moreover, as pointed out in the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 31: "According to the provisions of Article 39 of the Geneva Agreement on Laos, Article 46 of the Agreement on Vietnam, and Article 25 of the Agreement on Cambodia, it is clear that the three international commissions should continue to operate until the political issues of the three countries are fully resolved." Therefore, the current proposal to unilaterally cease the activities of the International Commission for Laos is a violation of the provisions and spirit of the Geneva Accords.

　　Article 13 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates: "The participating countries should consult each other on any issues raised by the International Commission to them in order to study the measures necessary to ensure that the cessation of hostilities agreements in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam are respected." Now, the International Commission for Laos has raised the question of whether the commission should continue to perform its duties to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. We hope that the countries concerned can reach a consensus based on the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the interests of peace in Indochina, and in a spirit of mutual consultation. As far as the current situation is concerned, an appropriate reduction in its activities and staffing will be feasible as long as it does not affect the performance of the tasks of the International Commission for Laos; however, ceasing the activities of the commission or any other unilateral action will only harm the implementation of the Geneva Accords throughout Indochina and contribute to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine the three international commissions in Indochina and to undermine peace in Indochina.

　　The fact is very clear that whether or not the International Commission for Laos continues to exist is a matter related to peace in Indochina. China is one of the countries that participated in the Geneva Conference and is also a friendly neighbor of the Indochinese countries. We cannot remain silent on this issue. We believe that the International Commission for Laos must continue to work, and the provisions of the Geneva Accords must be faithfully implemented on this issue.

　　老挝国际委员会必须继续工作
　　本报评论员
    老挝在实现了国家的和平和统一并成立了联合政府之后，在5月4日举行了补充选举。这是日内瓦协议在老挝实施的一个重大成就。它是老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队双方共同努力的结果。在这方面，老挝国际委员会曾经作出了积极的贡献。这一事实同时也充分表明了，国际委员会对于在印度支那各国协议的实施所起的积极的和重要的作用。现在，人们正殷切盼望越南、老挝、柬埔寨三个国际委员会继续发挥它们应有的作用，促成日内瓦协议的全部实施和印度支那和平的进一步巩固，却出现了停止老挝国际委员会活动的主张。对此，我们不能不表示深切的关怀。我们认为这种主张是违背印度支那和平的利益、违反日内瓦协议的文字和精神的。我们完全同意越南民主共和国政府5月31日关于这一问题的声明，保留老挝国际委员会是完全必要的。
    首先，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协定的实施，现在还需要老挝国际委员会的继续监督。违反协定第十五条的报复和歧视行为还在继续发生。协定第十四条规定的政治解决还没有实现。日内瓦协议所规定的老挝国际委员会的任务还没有完成，没有任何理由在现在停止这个委员会的活动。
    其次，老挝的和平还没有得到巩固。美帝国主义目前正在施用各种压力和阴谋活动，加紧对老挝的干涉，形成对老挝和整个印度支那地区和平的威胁。最近美国国务院发言人甚至公然对老挝5月4日举行的补充选举表示“严重的不安”。美国政府还利用美“援”作为对老挝要挟勒索的手段，阴谋破坏老挝的和平和中立，实际上也就是在继续进行它的破坏日内瓦协议实施的罪恶活动。在这种情况下，老挝国际委员会负有不可推卸的重大责任；委员会的继续存在和积极认真地工作是完全必要的。
    老挝国际委员会的存在与否，同时还不是能够单纯根据老挝的情况孤立处理的。1954年的日内瓦协议上的历次讨论明确地承认印度支那的和平是不可分割的；会议的最后宣言的精神，特别是第四条和第五条，并且确认了这个原则。而且，正如越南民主共和国政府5月31日的声明中所指出的：“根据日内瓦会议关于老挝问题协定的第三十九条、关于越南问题协定的第四十六条和关于柬埔寨问题协定的第二十五条的规定，显然，在三个国家的政治问题还没有完全解决以前，三个国际委员会应当继续进行活动。”因此，目前单独停止老挝国际委员会活动的主张是违反日内瓦协议的条文和精神的。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第十三条明确规定：“与会国家应就国际委员会向他们提出的任何问题彼此进行协商，以便研究为保证柬埔寨、老挝和越南的停止敌对行动协定被尊重所必需的措施”。现在，老挝国际委员会已经向日内瓦会议两位主席提出关于该委员会应否继续执行任务的问题，我们希望有关国家能够根据日内瓦协议的精神和印度支那和平的利益，本着互相协商的态度，取得一致意见。就目前情况来说，只要不影响老挝国际委员会的任务的执行，它的活动和编制的适当缩减将是可行的；但是，停止委员会的活动或其他任何片面行动，将只会对日内瓦协议在整个印度支那的实施造成损害，有助于美帝国主义破坏印度支那三个国际委员会、破坏印度支那和平的阴谋活动。
    事实很清楚，老挝国际委员会是否继续存在，是一个关系印度支那和平的问题。中国是参加日内瓦会议的国家之一，也是印度支那国家的友好邻邦。我们对于这个问题不能默尔而息，我们认为，老挝国际委员会必须继续工作，在这个问题上日内瓦协议的规定必须得到忠实的执行。
