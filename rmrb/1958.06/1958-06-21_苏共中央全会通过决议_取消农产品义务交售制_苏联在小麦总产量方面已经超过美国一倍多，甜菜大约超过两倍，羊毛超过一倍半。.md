Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 20th: TASS Moscow, June 19th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session in Moscow on June 17th and 18th.

The meeting heard and discussed the report by Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on abolishing the mandatory sales system and payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations, as well as on the new system, purchase prices, and conditions for agricultural product procurement, and adopted corresponding resolutions on this report.

The meeting elected Podgorny and Polyansky as alternate members of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee held in Moscow recently passed resolutions on abolishing the mandatory sales system and payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations, as well as on the new system, purchase prices, and conditions for agricultural product procurement.

The resolution considers it appropriate that, starting from 1958, the system of collective farms' mandatory sales of agricultural products to the state and payment in kind to machine tractor stations, technical repair stations, and specialized stations in agricultural cooperatives be abolished. In the future, the state will procure agricultural products from collective farms through purchases.

The resolution also considers it necessary to write off all debts owed by collective farms in past years regarding mandatory sales, purchase contracts, and payment in kind for the work of machine tractor stations and specialized stations.

The resolution addressed the further consolidation of the Soviet collective farm system and the increase in the procurement volume of Soviet agricultural products. The resolution pointed out that by the end of 1957, the number of specialized personnel with higher and secondary professional education in Soviet collective farms and machine tractor stations had increased from 83,000 in mid-July 1953 to 278,000. In the past four years, the state has invested 75.4 billion rubles in agriculture, which is 10 billion rubles more than the total investment in agriculture during the Second, Third, Fourth, and the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plans. In the past four years, the average annual procurement volume of major agricultural products has increased compared to the previous four years: grain increased by 22%, wheat increased by 44%, oil crop seeds increased by 34%, potatoes increased by 28%, raw cotton increased by 12%, and sugar beet increased by 36%.

Currently, the Soviet Union's total wheat output has more than doubled that of the United States, sugar beet approximately more than doubled, and wool more than one and a half times. In 1957, the Soviet Union's milk production had reached approximately 95% of the United States' milk production, and animal oil production had exceeded that of the United States.

The resolution emphasized that the new agricultural product procurement system could only be implemented because of the successful implementation of the measures adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at the end of March this year to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize the machine tractor stations. The resolution pointed out that many collective farms across the Soviet Union had purchased technical equipment before the spring planting this year. The spring planting situation also showed that it is better to hand over tractors and other agricultural machinery to collective farms for direct use than to have them used by machine tractor stations.

The CPSU Central Committee resolution pointed out that due to the implementation of measures to further strengthen the collective farm system and reorganize the machine tractor stations, new conditions have been established in agriculture, requiring a change in the agricultural product procurement system. The resolution said that it is no longer necessary to retain the current agricultural product procurement system: mandatory sales of agricultural products and payment in kind to machine tractor stations. Therefore, it is appropriate to transition to a unified form of state procurement – the purchasing of agricultural products.

The resolution pointed out that the implementation of new agricultural product purchase prices will help increase the material interest of collective farms and collective farmers in increasing the production of agricultural and livestock products.

    苏共中央全会通过决议
    取消农产品义务交售制
    苏联在小麦总产量方面已经超过美国一倍多，甜菜大约超过两倍，羊毛超过一倍半。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会于6月17日和18日在莫斯科举行了全体会议。
    会议听取和讨论了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志所作的关于取消义务交售制和机器拖拉机站工作的实物报酬以及关于新的农产品采购制度、采购价格和条件的报告，并且就这个报告通过了相应的决议。
    会议选举波德戈尔内和波利扬斯基为苏共中央主席团候补委员。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏共中央日前在莫斯科举行的全体会议通过了关于取消义务交售制和对机器拖拉机站工作的实物报酬以及关于采购农产品的新制度、采购价格和条件的决议。
    决议认为，这样做是适宜的，即：从1958年起，取消集体农庄向国家义务交售农产品以及向机器拖拉机站、技术修理站及农庄中的专业站支付实物报酬的制度。今后，将由国家通过收购方式来采购集体农庄的农产品。
    决议同时认为，有必要勾销集体农庄在过去一些年内在义务交售、购买合同以及对机器拖拉机站和专业站的工作支付实物报酬方面所欠下的全部债务。
    决议谈到了苏联集体农庄制度进一步巩固和苏联农产品采购量增加的情况。决议指出，截至1957年底，苏联集体农庄和机器拖拉机站中受过高等和中等专业教育的专门人材已经由1953年7月中旬的八万三千名增加到二十七万八千名。在最近四年当中，国家向农业投资了七百五十四亿卢布，这比在第二、第三、第四个五年计划期间和第五个五年计划头三年在农业方面的投资的总和还多一百亿卢布。在过去四年中，主要农产品的每年平均采购量比前四年增加了：谷物增加了22％，小麦增加了44％，油料作物种子增加了34％，马铃薯增加28％，原棉增加12％，甜菜增加36％。
    现在，苏联在小麦总产量方面已经超过美国一倍多，甜菜大约超过两倍，羊毛超过一倍半。1957年，苏联的牛奶产量已经达到美国牛奶产量的95％左右，动物油的产量已经超过了美国。
    决议强调指出，由于顺利地实现苏联最高苏维埃今年3月底通过的进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施，苏联现在才可能实行新的农产品采购制度。决议指出，到今年春播以前苏联全国已经有很多集体农庄购买了技术设备。春播的情况也表明，把拖拉机和其他农业机器交给集体农庄直接使用比以前由机器拖拉机站使用要好。
    苏共中央决议指出，由于执行了关于进一步加强集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施，在农业中建立了新的条件，要求改变农产品采购制度。决议说，现在没有必要保留现行的农产品采购制度：义务交售农产品和对机器拖拉机站支付实物报酬。因此，现在过渡到统一的国家采购形式——收购农产品——是适宜的。
    决议指出，实行新的农产品采购价格将有助于提高集体农庄和集体农民对增加农产品和畜产品生产的物质兴趣。
