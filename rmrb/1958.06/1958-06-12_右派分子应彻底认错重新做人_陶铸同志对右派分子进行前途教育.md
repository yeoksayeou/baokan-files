Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 11th. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), delivered a speech on the 6th, providing future education to rightists within democratic parties and intellectual circles. He clarified the Party's policy towards rightists and called on them to thoroughly recognize their mistakes, start anew, and strive to return to the revolutionary ranks.

Comrade Tao Zhu's remarks were made at a report meeting held by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC. More than 1,800 people attended, including responsible persons from local organizations of democratic parties in Guangdong Province, members of the CPPCC, and people from intellectual circles. More than 500 rightists participated in this meeting. After analyzing the current great leap forward situation of socialist construction in China, Comrade Tao Zhu pointed out that although we must shift our main energy to technological and cultural revolutions in order to rapidly build socialism in China, we cannot relax our vigilance against class struggle at home and abroad. He said that our struggle with the rightists is a serious class struggle. After the anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological offensive of the rightists has been crushed. In the future, we must continue to eliminate the influence of rightist ideas, pull down all the white flags, and universally plant the red flag of proletarian ideology, so as to better mobilize the people of the whole country and implement the general line of socialist construction.

Comrade Tao Zhu pointed out that, based on the current performance of the rightists, they can be divided into three types: those who are sincerely convinced, those who are outwardly convinced but not very convinced in their hearts, and those who are not convinced at all. He said that the first and third types are in the minority, while the second type is the majority. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the ideological and political transformation of the rightists, so as to turn negative factors into positive ones. It now seems that, after a combination of strictness and leniency in handling the cases, the vast majority of rightists can be transformed. Of course, the most important thing is still determined by the efforts of the rightists themselves. He said that this transformation should be carried out in two aspects: on the one hand, to educate them with facts, to organize them to visit factories and rural areas, so that they can see with their own eyes the upsurge of socialist construction, the revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and peasants, and the great achievements of the Party in rural work. Facts speak louder than words. As long as they truly believe in the facts and respect the facts, their thinking will inevitably change. On the other hand, in addition to continuing to strictly draw a clear line between us and the rightists, we should also pay attention to taking the initiative to contact the rightists, understand their ideological situation, enlighten them, and guide them. Those who are indeed in great difficulties in life should also be given necessary assistance. For those rightists who have truly recognized their mistakes and have shown progress in their actual actions, they should also be encouraged according to the spirit of treating them differently, and strive to thoroughly transform them. Of course, if they insist on adhering to the rightist position, then they can continue to be their rightists, and the people will of course continue to fight against their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds.

Comrade Tao Zhu finally pointed out the future and way out for the rightists. He said that the rightists should thoroughly recognize their mistakes, learn from the lessons of their past mistakes, repent, and truly have the determination and courage to surrender to the truth, surrender to the people, undergo a transformation, and start anew. Only in this way can they hope to be forgiven by the people and have the possibility of returning to the revolutionary ranks.

Before holding this report meeting, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC organized democratic party members and rightists to visit the socialist construction situation in rural areas of Xinhui, Maoming, and Dianbai counties, and the CPPCC, democratic parties, and major universities and colleges held forums for rightists respectively. Many rightists have been educated from this and expressed their determination to thoroughly repent and continue to examine and criticize their mistakes.

    右派分子应彻底认错重新做人
    陶铸同志对右派分子进行前途教育
    新华社广州11日电　中共广东省委第一书记、政协广东省委员会主席陶铸同志，在6日对民主党派、知识界中的右派分子进行了一次前途教育，阐明了党对右派分子的政策，号召右派分子彻底认识错误，重新做人，争取回到革命队伍中来。
    陶铸同志的这番话是在政协广东省委员会举办的有民主党派广东省地方组织负责人、政协委员、知识界人士共一千八百多人参加的传达中共八大二次会议精神的报告会上说的。有五百多名右派分子参加了这个会议。陶铸同志在分析了目前我国社会主义建设大跃进形势后指出：尽管我们必须把主要精力转到技术革命和文化革命方面来，以便在我国迅速建成社会主义，但是我们不能因此放松对国内外阶级斗争的警惕性。他说，我们和右派的斗争，就是一场严重的阶级斗争。经过反右派斗争，右派分子在政治上思想上的进攻已经被粉碎了。今后我们还要继续清除右派思想的影响，把白旗全部拔掉，把无产阶级思想的红旗普遍地插起来，以便更好地动员全国人民，贯彻社会主义建设总路线。
    陶铸同志指出：根据目前右派分子的表现，可分为三种类型：一种是口服心服的，一种是口服心还不大服的，一种是口也不服的。他说第一种和第三种都是少数，第二种是多数。因此必须继续加强对右派分子思想上和政治上的改造，以便把消极因素变为积极因素。现在看来，经过严肃和宽大相结合的处理以后，绝大部分右派分子是可以改造过来的，当然，最主要的还是决定于右派分子本人的努力。他说，这种改造应从两个方面去进行：一方面是用事实去教育他们，组织他们到工厂、农村去参观，使他们亲眼看到社会主义建设的热潮，看到工人和农民的革命干劲，看到党在农村工作中的重大成就。事实胜于雄辩，只要他们真正相信事实、尊重事实，思想就必然要有所改变的。另一方面，我们除了要继续严格划清和右派分子的思想界线外，还要注意主动和右派分子接触，了解他们的思想情况，启发他们，开导他们。对于他们中的一些人在生活上确实很困难的，也应给予必要的帮助。对于那些真正认识了错误，并且在实际行动中表现进步的右派分子，也要根据分别对待的精神，给予鼓励，争取把他们彻底改造过来。当然，如果他们硬要坚持右派立场，那么他们可以继续当他们的右派，人民当然要继续对他们的反共反人民反社会主义的言行作斗争。
    陶铸同志最后给右派分子指出了前途和出路。他说，右派分子应该彻底认识错误，吸取过去犯错误的教训，痛改前非，真正有决心有勇气地向真理投降，向人民投降，脱胎换骨，重新做人。只有这样，才能可望得到人民的宽恕，才有可能回到革命队伍中来。
    在举行这次报告会以前，政协广东省委员会曾组织民主党派人士和右派分子到新会、茂名、电白等县农村参观社会主义建设的情况，并由政协、各民主党派组织和各大专学校分别召开了右派分子座谈会。不少右派分子从中得到了教育，表示要彻底悔改，继续检查和批判自己的错误。
