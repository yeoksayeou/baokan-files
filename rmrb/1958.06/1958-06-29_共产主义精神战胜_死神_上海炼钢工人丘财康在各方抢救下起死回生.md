Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th: A steelworker seriously burned by molten iron, whose case many foreign medical texts deemed irrecoverable – Qiu CaiKang, furnace chief and Communist Party member from the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, has seen his condition greatly improve thanks to his tenacious will to build socialism, the Party organization's heartfelt care, the strong support from all sectors of society, and the meticulous rescue efforts of the Guangci Hospital medical staff.

On the late night of May 26th, Qiu CaiKang, after being burned by molten iron, was sent to Guangci Hospital. Diagnosis revealed that Qiu CaiKang's burn area was 89.3%. According to many foreign medical texts, the mortality rate for a person with skin burns exceeding 50% to 60% is 85%; if it exceeds 70%, it is very difficult to treat, and death will occur within two or three days. Therefore, many doctors once believed that Qiu CaiKang could only live for three days at most. However, Qiu CaiKang has now safely passed the two difficult hurdles medically known as "shock" and bacterial infection, and the wounds are gradually healing.

In this tense month, the deeds surrounding the struggle to save Qiu CaiKang's life have formed a vivid Communist teaching material. The most touching chapter is the noble Communist qualities demonstrated by Qiu CaiKang himself.

When Qiu CaiKang awoke from anesthesia, his first thought was of his eyes, fearing that if he went blind, he would not be able to return to the furnace. He said to the doctor: "Find a way to cure me! I am very important, the furnace cannot do without me." He also said that his wife and children at home were being taken care of by the organization, so he was relieved, the only thing he worried about was the factory's production. He even shouted about his beloved steel in his sleep. When the factory sent representatives to visit him, telling him that they had collected his salary on his behalf, his first question was whether the Party dues had been paid. His chest and back were burned all over, with the muscles completely exposed, and he sometimes had to lie prone for a whole day, enduring the pain for twenty-four hours. When he was slightly more conscious, he would talk to the doctors and nurses about his thoughts, work, and life, using his own experiences to tell the medical staff about the significant contrast in workers' political and living conditions before and after liberation. This noble quality unique to Communist Party members moved the surrounding medical staff to tears, who believed it was the most vivid and concrete class education.

All relevant sectors of society demonstrated a selfless spirit in the process of rescuing Qiu CaiKang's life. When Qiu CaiKang urgently needed a skin graft on his leg, an ordinary resident generously allowed the skin of their recently deceased relative to be donated, solving a medical problem. The factory director, workers, and designers of the state-owned Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory worked together for eight hours to design and modify a special bed for the injured patient. After this bed was delivered to Guangci Hospital, an old worker from the Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory came to the hospital late that night, telling the doctor that the bed delivered in the afternoon was not ideal enough, and the patient would definitely be uncomfortable lying on it. He suggested adding a movable device to the bed to support the patient's body, which would be more comfortable. He said that he had only thought of this method after dinner, so he was late. Although this bed was not used later, the worker's spirit deeply moved the medical staff.

Manufacturing an ideal bed to minimize pressure on Qiu CaiKang's wounds and make it easy to turn over became a matter of great concern for many people. The technicians at Guangci Hospital displayed a high degree of creativity and made a simple and lightweight double-sided turning bed in eighteen hours. With just one turn, the patient could turn over, which could promote the healing of the patient's wounds. After this bed was successfully manufactured, it lacked air cushions. After the person in charge of the Second Plastics Factory on the other side of the Huangpu River learned about this, he gave up his rest time and worked with five or six people from afternoon until one o'clock in the morning to finally make two air cushions. After they were made, the workers and doctors crossed the river together overnight and delivered the light, soft, inflatable and deflatable plastic cushions to the hospital.

In the first few days, a large amount of plasma was needed for medical treatment, but the Guangci Hospital's laboratory did not have that much storage. When they requested assistance from the Municipal Medical Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, Renji Hospital, and other units, they immediately received a large supply. In addition, a large number of enthusiastic letters were written by workers, government cadres, students, and citizens, expressing their readiness to donate their precious blood and skin for the rescue of Qiu CaiKang. On June 16th alone, 838 people went to the hospital to register for skin donation.

Snatching Qiu CaiKang's life back from the hands of death involved an ideological struggle among the doctors at Guangci Hospital. Initially, many senior doctors were deeply influenced by foreign medical literature and believed that the patient's condition was so severe that it could not be saved. After the Guangci Hospital Party General Branch discovered this situation, it invited outside experts to the hospital for consultation and convened a meeting of physicians to discuss the matter. The General Branch Secretary and President of the Hospital said at the meeting that in capitalist countries, the wealthy and privileged live in comfort and would not be burned, only the working people would encounter such misfortune. At the same time, medical scientists there cannot use all their knowledge and wisdom to save the lives of the working people, so the statistics made under those circumstances should absolutely not be considered scientific. Our country is a socialist country led by the working class, and the noble responsibility of medical personnel is to serve the working people, so we should do everything possible to rescue the patient. The doctors present were moved by this analysis and found direction, and coupled with the education given to them by Qiu CaiKang's noble performance, they moved from being passive to being active and actively researched treatment methods. They finally created a miracle not recorded in medical history.

Currently, Qiu CaiKang's condition has gradually improved. New flesh and tender skin have grown on his face, back, and chest. Relevant parties and medical personnel are making every effort to help him recover his health as soon as possible.

### 共产主义精神战胜“死神”  上海炼钢工人丘财康在各方抢救下起死回生

    共产主义精神战胜“死神”
    上海炼钢工人丘财康在各方抢救下起死回生
    新华社上海28日电 一个被铁水烫成重伤、在许多外国医学文献上认为难以挽救的炼钢工人——上钢三厂转炉车间司炉长、共产党员丘财康，由于他具有建设社会主义的顽强意志，由于党组织的亲切关怀，社会上各方面的大力支援，和广慈医院医务人员的悉心抢救，现在伤势已经大为好转了。
    5月26日深夜，丘财康被铁水烫伤后，被送到广慈医院。经诊断证明，丘财康烫伤面积为89.3％。据外国许多医学文献记载，一个人的皮肤烫伤面积如超过50％到60％，死亡率是85％；如超过70％，就很难救治，两三天内就要死亡。因此，许多医生曾经认为丘财康顶多只能活上三天。可是丘财康现在已经安全地度过了在医学上被称为“休克”和细菌感染的两道难关，创伤开始逐渐平复。
    在这紧张的一个月中，环绕着抢救丘财康生命而斗争的事迹，构成了一部生动的共产主义教材。其中最感人的一章，是丘财康本人所表现出来的崇高的共产主义品质。
    当丘财康在麻醉苏醒以后，首先想到的是自己的眼睛，怕瞎了以后不能再回到炉子旁边去。他对医生说：“想办法把我医好吧！我这个人很重要，炉子离不开我。”他还说，家中妻子儿女有组织上照顾，都放心得下，唯一不放心的是厂里的生产。他甚至在睡梦中也叫喊他那心爱的钢铁。工厂派代表去慰问他，告诉他已经代他领了工资，他第一句就问党费交了没有？他的胸背周身都烧伤了，饥肉完全暴露在外面，有时必须俯卧一天，他就忍着疼痛俯睡了二十四小时。当他稍有精神时，就和医生、护士们谈思想，谈工作，谈生活，以亲身的经历，告诉医务人员解放前后工人在政治上、生活上的显著对比。这种共产党员所特有的高尚品质，使周围的医务人员感动得流泪，他们认为这是一课最生动的有血有肉的阶级教育。
    社会上各有关方面在抢救丘财康生命的过程中，表现出了无私的精神。当丘财康的腿部急需移植皮肤时，一位普通居民慷慨地允许将自己刚刚死去的亲人的皮肤捐献出来，解决了医疗上的一个难题。国营上海医疗器械厂的厂长、工人和设计人员一起继续工作了八个小时，为受伤病人设计和改装了一只特殊病床。在这只病床送到广慈医院后，当天深夜又有上海医疗器械厂一位老工人来到医院，向医生说下午送来的那只床还不够理想，病人睡在上面一定不舒服，如果在床上添一个活动设备以支托病人的身体，就可以舒服一些。他说这个方法是晚饭后才想出来的，所以来得迟了。这只床后来虽然没有使用，但这位工人的精神使医务人员十分感动。
    制造一只最理想的床，让丘财康的伤口少受压迫，又容易翻身，曾经成为许多人最关心的事情。广慈医院的技工们发挥了高度的创造性，在十八个小时内，做好一只简便、轻巧的双面转床，只要一转动，病人就可以翻过身来，这只床可以促进病人伤口的恢复。这只床制造成功以后，缺少气垫，在黄浦江对岸的第二塑料工厂负责人知道以后，放弃了休息时间，同五、六个人一起从下午直做到深夜一时，终于制成两只气垫。制成以后，工人们和医生又一起连夜横渡江面，将又轻又软又能放气打气的塑料垫子送给医院。
    最初几天，医疗上需要大量血浆，而广慈医院化验部却没有这许多储存量。当他们向市立医学化验所、中山医院、仁济医院等单位求援时，立即得到了大量供应。此外，广大工人、机关干部、学生和市民写来了许多热情洋溢的信件，表示时刻准备着捐献自己宝贵的鲜血和皮肤，供抢救丘财康之用。6月16日一天，就有八百三十八人前往医院报名捐献皮肤。
    把丘财康的生命从死神手中夺回来，在广慈医院医生中间是经过一番思想斗争的。最初，许多高级医生受外国医学文献的影响很深，认为伤者的病情如此严重，无法挽救。广慈医院党总支发现这一情况后，一面邀集院外专家来院会诊，一面召集医师会议，讨论这件事情。总支书记兼院长在会上说，在资本主义国家，豪门贵族养尊处优，不会被烫伤的，只有劳动人民才会遭遇这种不幸。同时，那里的医学家是不能为抢救劳动人民的生命用尽一切学识和智慧的，因此在那种情况下作出的统计材料绝对不能认为是科学的。我们的国家是工人阶级领导的社会主义国家，医务人员的崇高责任是为劳动人民服务，因此对病人就应该千方百计地进行抢救。在场的医生们都为这段分析所激动，找到了方向，加上丘财康的崇高表现给他们的教育，于是从被动转为主动，积极地研究治疗的办法。他们终于首创了医学史上所没有记载的奇迹。
    目前，丘财康的伤势已逐渐好转，脸上、背部和胸部已长出新肉和嫩皮，有关方面和医务人员正在尽最大的努力使他早日恢复健康。
