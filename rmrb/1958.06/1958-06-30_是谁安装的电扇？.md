 Who Installed the Electric Fans?
 Tianjin Second Aluminum Products Factory Worker Wang Xirong

 Before work, the workers from the rolling section were gathered at the General Affairs Section again! Section Chief Liu was cleaning up, and when he saw them coming, he quickly put down the broom and said to everyone with a smile, half-jokingly, "Hey guys, please come in and sit down." Little Yu, who likes to joke, said with a smile, "Wow, Section Chief is really polite, looks like the big-character poster wasn't posted in vain for you." This sentence made everyone laugh. The leader of the rolling section said very seriously to Section Chief Liu, "What's the status of our electric fans? That's what everyone is here for..." "Under study," Section Chief Liu said with a smile. Old Wei, who is quick-tempered, said to Section Chief Liu's face as if he wanted to argue, "It's always under study, how many years will it take to study! The weather is getting hotter and hotter, don't let it be a case of digging a well when you're already thirsty!" Section Chief Liu said with a smile to Old Wei, "Don't worry..." Old Song chimed in, "If the electric fans aren't installed quickly, it will be difficult for our rolling section to complete the June leap forward plan, because when the weather is hot, the machine becomes hot to the touch after only two hours of use, so we have to let it cool before we can roll again. If you let the machine cool down several times a day, how can the leap forward plan be completed?..." "If it doesn't work, we'll write them another 'big-character poster'," Little Yu said with a grin. Section Chief Liu listened and said, "I heard your group leader tell me about the problem Old Song mentioned a few days ago, and it is indeed an important issue. I have discussed it with the factory director several times, and the factory director is very supportive of installing electric fans in the rolling section, but the 'money' is not easy to solve. Our factory needs to install six electric fans in the rolling section, machine repair department... this year, which will cost more than a thousand yuan? Originally, there was this expenditure plan for June, but it was used to buy raw materials due to urgent needs. So, the problem of installing electric fans will only be resolved in July..." Later, the bell rang for the start of work, and everyone quickly ran into the workshop. This was on a Saturday morning.

 On Monday morning, as soon as the work bell rang, the four rolling machines started spinning at the same time. A small breeze blew in from somewhere, and the wind got stronger and stronger with the speed of the machines. Old Wei looked up at the ceiling and shouted in surprise, "Look, the electric fans are installed!" When the others looked, sure enough, the electric fans were installed, and everyone couldn't help but be happy. The group leader found Section Chief Liu to ask about it, but Section Chief Liu didn't know about it. He also came to the rolling machine with the group leader with a sense of surprise, and said to the group leader, "I'm still worried about the electric fans! I really didn't expect..." After leaving the workshop, he found the factory director to ask about it, and only then did he know the story:

 On that Saturday morning, when Master Cui, the leader of the machine repair department, went to the General Affairs Section to get something, he heard everything that the comrades in the rolling section and Section Chief Liu had discussed about installing electric fans. All morning, his mind was filled with: "Without electric fans, the rolling section will not be able to complete the leap forward plan; six electric fans cost more than a thousand yuan; they won't be installed until July. To build socialism, we must be faster, better, and more economical..." At noon, Master Cui didn't even bother to eat, and ran to the factory director's office. He told the factory director everything he thought and the process of the machine repair department installing a self-made electric fan driven by a jackshaft, as well as the method of installing electric fans for the rolling section. The factory director was very supportive of Master Cui's initiative and said to Master Cui, "What do you need? We'll give you whatever you need, and we'll solve any difficulties you have first." After Master Cui finished lunch, he told everyone about his plan to install electric fans for the rolling section when the group finished reading the newspaper. Everyone agreed with Master Cui's opinion. On Sunday morning, all the comrades in the machine repair department threw themselves into the battle of installing electric fans. Some were looking for scrap materials in the scrap iron pile, some were cutting scrap aluminum sheets, and some were looking for scrap belts... All the workshops in the factory were very quiet, only the machine repair department was filled with the sound of hammers and machines. In less than half a day, four electric fans were installed above the four rolling machines. After calculating the accounts: except for using a small amount of materials, not a single penny of cash was spent.

 When this matter spread throughout the factory, big-character posters like snowflakes flew in from various groups... (Attached picture)

    是谁安装的电扇？
    天津第二铝品厂工人　王锡荣
    上班前，轧片组的工人又堆到总务科去啦！刘科长正在搞卫生，他一见他们来啦，忙放下笤帚，对大家笑着半开玩笑的说：“哥儿几个，请里边坐吧。”爱开玩笑的小于笑着说：“嗬，科长真客气，看来大字报没白给你贴啊。”这句话惹的大家也都笑啦。轧片组的组长很正经的对刘科长说：“我们的电扇怎么样啦，大伙就是为这个事来的……。”“正在研究”刘科长笑着说。爱犯急躁脾气的老魏像要吵架似的对着刘科长的脸说：“又是正在研究，到底研究到么年头啊！天气越来越热啦，可别弄个临渴掘井啊！”刘科长笑着对老魏说：“你先别着急……”老宋在一旁插嘴说：“如果不快安装电扇，我们轧片组的6月份跃进计划很难完成，因为天气热，机器用不了两个小时就烫手，这就得晾一晾才能再轧片，你想一天晾上几次机器，跃进计划怎么去完成呢？……”。“不行再给他们写一张‘大字报’”，小于在一旁做了个鬼脸笑着说。刘科长听了说：“老宋说的问题前几天我就听你们组长给我说过，这确是个重要问题，我和厂长几次进行了研究，厂长是很支持给轧片组安装电扇的，不过就是‘钱’不好解决，咱们厂今年在轧片组、机器修理部……共需要安装六个电扇，这样就得需要一千多元呢？原来6月份有这个开支计划，但是因急需买原料给占用啦。所以安装电扇的问题要在7月份才能解决……”后来上班的预备铃响啦，大家很快的跑进了车间。这是在星期六早晨的事。
    在星期一的早晨，上班铃一响，四台轧片机同时??的转动起来，不知从什么地方刮来一阵小凉风，随着机器的速度，风越来越大啦。老魏抬头向房顶子上一看，惊喜的喊了出来：“你们看，电扇安好啦”！其余的人一看，果然电扇安装好啦，人们都不由得乐啦。组长找到刘科长一问，刘科长却不知道这件事，他也怀着一种惊奇的心情跟组长来到轧片机前，对组长说：“我还正在为安电扇的事发愁呢？真想不到……”从车间出来，他找到厂长一问，才知道，事情是这样的：
    在星期六那天早晨，机器修理部的组长——崔师傅到总务科要东西时，把轧片组同志们和刘科长谈的关于安装电扇的事都听到啦，整整一个上午，他脑子里回绕着：“不安电扇轧片组完不成跃进计划；六个电扇一千多元；7月份才能安装。建设社会主义，要多快好省……”中午崔师傅饭也没顾的吃，就跑到了厂长室，他一五一十的把自己所想的和机器修理部安装好了一个用天轴来代动的自制电扇的经过以及给轧片组安装电扇的办法，都告诉了厂长，厂长对崔师傅的创举非常支持，并对崔师傅说：“你们需要什么？给什么，有什么困难首先给你们解决”。崔师傅吃完了午饭，在小组读完报的时候，把给轧片组安装电扇的打算向大家一说，大家都非常同意崔师傅的意见，星期日的上午，机器修理部的全体同志都投入了安装电扇的战斗。有的在废铁堆里找废料，有的裁废铝片，还有的找废皮带……厂里各个车间里都非常静，只有机器修理部传出一片铁锤和机器声。不到半天的时间，四个电扇就安装在四台轧片机的上空了。一算帐：除了用一小部分材料外，没花分文现钱。
    当这件事在全厂传遍的时候，像雪片一样的大字报又从各小组飞来……。（附图片）
