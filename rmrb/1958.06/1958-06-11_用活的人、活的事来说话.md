    Speaking with Living People and Living Events
    People's Daily has opened a column called "Greatness Springs from the Ordinary" since May 25th, and has continuously introduced the deeds of some famous Chinese and foreign inventors and creators in history. After reading it, I was very inspired and moved. From their deeds, we can see such a truth: as long as you dare to innovate and create, you can achieve great things.
    I hope that newspapers can use more space to introduce modern and current advanced figures and advanced deeds. Because now is an era of heroes. Speaking with living people and living events can play a better role in inspiring and educating people.

    用活的人、活的事来说话
    人民日报从5月25日起开辟“伟大出于平凡”的专栏，连续介绍了一些历史上有名的中外发明家、创造者的事迹。读了之后，很受启发和感动。从他们的事迹中可以看出这样的真理：只要敢于革新创造，就能做出伟大的事迹来。    希望报纸上能用更多的篇幅来介绍现代的、当前的先进人物和先进事迹。因为现在是出英雄的时代。用活的人、活的事来说话，更能起到启发教育作用。
