    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 26th. A report on the European economic situation in the first quarter of 1958, released today by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, illustrates the completely different trends in the economic activities of socialist and capitalist countries. The former is thriving, while the latter is stagnating and declining. The report was published by the secretariat of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in its current issue of the "Economic Bulletin for Europe."
    The report states: "The industrial situation in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union at the beginning of this year appears to be very good. Available materials on the results of the first quarter indicate that the pace of overall development in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Poland has exceeded that of a year ago and has also exceeded the pace stipulated in the 1958 annual plan." In Hungary, "production appears to be steadily increasing."
    The report points out: "In the Soviet Union, total industrial output in the first quarter of 1958 increased by 11%, exceeding the original planned level of 4%. Two-thirds of this increase is the result of increased output in three categories of industries: machinery manufacturing, building materials, and fuel and power."
    The report says that in the first quarter of 1958, among the major industrial sectors in East Germany, the production level of metal-using industries "increased the most compared to last year's level." Housing construction has also increased very rapidly.
    In Albania, the recent "extensive reduction of retail prices" indicates that consumers' "real income will increase" this year.
    These developments and measures mark a steady improvement in the living standards of the socialist world.
    The report states that in Western Europe, in recent months, "there has been a trend of stagnation in industrial production," with "a tendency to decline" in some industrial countries, and "some signs of weakness" already appearing in others.
    This is due to a decrease in demand in domestic and international markets. According to the report, the output of metal-using industries, textiles, construction, and basic materials industries in most Western European countries in the first quarter of this year was less than in the same period in 1957.
    Coal production in West Germany and the United Kingdom, important coal-producing countries in Western Europe, is lower than last year's production, and their coal production may further decrease due to the rapid increase in inventories of coal and other commodities.
    The report continues, "In addition, the orders received by enterprises in Western European countries, especially orders for export goods, have decreased significantly. In some sectors, the orders are difficult to compare with the current productivity. This is worrying. There were very few new orders in the first quarter of 1958, and more and more orders have been cancelled."
    The report points out that the value of imports and exports in Western European countries in the first quarter generally declined compared to the same period in 1957.
    According to another report published in the same issue of the bulletin, "The international impact of the US economic recession" has spread to Western Europe. Due to the reduction in Western European imports from the United States, it is expected that US imports from Western Europe will also decrease. At the same time, the reduction in US imports from raw material producing countries, especially countries in Asia and Latin America, will make it more difficult for these countries to purchase the things they need for their development from Western Europe.

### 欧洲兄弟国家全面发展速度加快  资本主义国家经济活动停滞下降

    欧洲兄弟国家全面发展速度加快
    资本主义国家经济活动停滞下降
    新华社日内瓦26日电　联合国欧洲经济委员会今天发表的1958年第一季度欧洲经济情况的报告，说明了社会主义国家和资本主义国家的经济活动的完全不同的趋势。前者是蒸蒸日上，而后者却在停滞和下降。这项报告是由联合国欧洲经济委员会秘书处在它出版的本期“欧洲经济公报”上发表的。
    这个报告说：“今年一开始东欧和苏联的工业的情况看来就很好。关于第一季度结果的现有材料表明，苏联、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、东德和波兰的全面发展的速度超过了一年前的速度，而且还超过了1958年全年计划中规定的速度。”在匈牙利，“产量看来在稳步上升”。
    报告指出：“在苏联，1958年第一季度工业总产量增加了11％，超过了原来计划的4％的水平。这一增加数额有三分之二是机器制造业、建筑材料业以及燃料和动力业三类工业产量增加的结果。”
    报告说，在1958年第一季度，在民主德国的主要工业部门当中，使用金属的工业的生产水平“比去年的水平增长得最多”。房屋建筑也增加得非常迅速。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，最近“广泛降低零售价格”，表明今年消费者的“实际收入将有增加”。
    这些发展和措施标志着社会主义世界生活水平的稳步提高。
    报告说，在西欧，近几个月来“工业生产有停滞的趋势”，在某些工业国家“甚至有下降的趋向”，在另外一些国家“已经开始出现某些疲软的迹象”。
    这是由于国内和国际市场上需求减少的缘故。据报告说，西欧大多数国家的使用金属的工业、纺织业、建筑业和基本材料工业在今年第一季度的产量比1957年同一个时期减少了。
    西欧的重要产煤国家西德和英国的煤产量低于去年的产量，而且由于煤和其他方面存货的迅速增加，它们的煤产量可能进一步减少。
    报告接着说，此外，西欧国家的企业所接受的订单，特别是出口货的订单已经显著地减少了，在某些部门订单和目前的生产率是难以相比的。这使人们感到不安。它在1958年第一季度只有很少的新订单，而且有愈来愈多的订单已经取消了。
    报告指出，西欧国家第一季度的进出口价值比1957年同一个时期普遍地有所下降。
    根据同一期公报上发表的另一项报告，“美国经济衰退的国际影响”已经波及西欧。由于西欧从美国进口的产品的减少，可以预料美国从西欧进口的货物也将会减少。同时，美国从原料生产国家，特别是亚洲和拉丁美洲的国家进口的货物的减少将使这些国家更难以向西欧购买它们的发展所需要的东西。
