Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 5th: A tire repair cooperative in Xining City, with simple equipment and poor technical conditions, has successfully trial-produced seven kinds of ball bearings using indigenous methods. Putting these ball bearings on the wheels of horse-drawn carts, bulldozers, large flatbed carts, and handcarts can increase transport capacity by one or more times, which is very popular among farmers.

　　Manufacturing ball bearings was indeed difficult for this cooperative, which lacked equipment and only had twenty people, and they never dared to imagine it in the past. However, in the technical innovation movement, they liberated their minds and decided to try boldly. They processed the ball bearings very carefully on old lathes, and solved problems together as soon as they arose. For example, since the cooperative did not have annealing equipment, they made an annealing pot out of sheet iron and built a small annealing furnace out of adobe bricks. After many experiments, they finally achieved the annealing requirements. Now all the members of the cooperative are actively preparing for mass production to support the countryside.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The county-wide motorization and “ball bearing-ization” (installing ball bearings) of vehicles – this moving plan in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, has recently become possible to be fully realized because a small bicycle repair cooperative in the county has successfully trial-produced ball bearings using indigenous methods.

　　There are 58,000 small earth carts, flatbed carts, and waterwheels in Suqian County. More than 950 waterwheels have been equipped with ball bearing assemblies, and the efficiency has generally increased by nearly one time. If more than 57,000 earth carts and flatbed carts can also be fully refitted, it would be of great significance for the county's farmers to eliminate carrying loads on their shoulders and backs, and to support the summer harvest and summer planting. However, refitting these vehicles requires more than 2 million ball bearings, which are in short supply in the market and difficult to buy.

　　At this time, a bicycle repair cooperative without power or machine tools bravely took on this task. They repeatedly studied and created an indigenous machine for manufacturing ball bearings. Lacking materials, they thinned the purchased scrap steel rails into steel bars, sent them into the indigenous machine to press, and after several days and nights of hard work and drilling, finally made the ball bearings. The news quickly spread to the ears of the surrounding farmers, and people came to ask for ball bearings every day.

　　Now, Ma Guangming, Zhang Yongsheng, and Fang Guoxing, three workers in this factory, are working on creating a special machine for pressing ball bearings and polishing tools. To support their work, the County United Cooperative transferred an old motor and three tons of small round steel. When these new tools are put into production, the “ball bearing-ization” of vehicles throughout the county will be guaranteed.

### 海水不可斗量  英雄不可貌相  青海和江苏两个修理合作社制成滚珠

　　海水不可斗量  英雄不可貌相
    青海和江苏两个修理合作社制成滚珠
    据新华社西宁5日电　西宁市一个设备简陋、技术条件很差的胶轮车修配合作社，用土法试制成功了七种滚珠轴承。把这几种滚珠轴承装在马拉车、推土车、大板车、架子车等的车轮上，运输能力能提高一倍或一倍以上，很受农民欢迎。
    制造滚珠轴承，对这个设备缺乏、只有二十个人的合作社来说确有很多困难，过去从来不敢设想。但是在技术革新运动中，他们解放思想，决定大胆尝试一番。他们在旧车床上特别细心地把滚珠轴承加工出来，一有问题就共同研究解决。例如社里没有闷火设备，他们就用铁皮做成一个闷火罐，用土坯砌成一个小闷火炉，经过多次试验，终于使闷火达到了要求。现在全社社员正积极准备大批生产，支援农村。
    本报讯　全县车子化、车子弹子化（装上滚珠），江苏宿迁县这个动人的规划，最近已因这个县一个小小的自行车修理合作社用土法试成滚珠，而有可能完满实现了。
    宿迁全县有五万八千辆小土车、平车和水车，有九百五十多辆水车已经安上弹子盘，功效一般提高近一倍，如果五万七千多辆土车、平车也能全部改装，对全县农民消灭肩挑背负，支援夏收夏种意义很大。但是改装这些车子需要二百多万粒滚珠，这种滚珠市场缺货，很难买到。
    这时，一个没有动力、没有机床的自行车修理合作社勇敢地担负起了这个任务。他们反复研究，造出了一部制造滚珠的土机器。缺乏材料，他们就把买来的废旧钢轨开细了打成钢条，送进土机器去压，经过几个昼夜的苦干、苦钻，终于把滚珠制成了，消息飞快传到了周围农民的耳朵里，天天有人来要滚珠。
    现在，马广明、张永胜和方国兴这个厂的三个工人正在着手创造一种压制滚珠的专用机器和磨光工具。为了支持他们的工作，县联社调来了一部旧马达和三吨小圆钢，等到这些新工具投入生产后，全县车子弹子化就有了保证。
