    The Fundamental Principle Remains the Same

    Regarding the summit conference, Dulles once emphatically stated: the conference must have the hope of reaching a consensus agreement, and not merely put on a show for everyone to see.

    Now that the experts' meeting on monitoring the cessation of nuclear tests is about to be held, Dulles then stated: any agreement reached at the meeting does not necessarily obligate the United States to cease nuclear tests. This is to make the meeting only discuss and not solve substantive problems. It can be perfectly expressed in Dulles's own words as merely putting on a show for everyone to see.

    This attitude of Dulles is actually not surprising. Originally, on the issue of the cessation of nuclear testing, because the Soviet Union had already taken the initiative to unilaterally stop, there was a great hope for the expert meeting to reach a consensus agreement on this issue. Dulles was afraid that the experts would really come up with something, so he resorted to old tricks to try to make the expert meeting meaningless and a deception to the people. In the end, Dulles's fundamental principle remains the same: to do everything possible to undermine East-West negotiations and to strenuously obstruct the relaxation of international tensions.

    万变不离其宗
    对于最高级会议，杜勒斯曾经口口声声表示：必须使会议能有达成一致协议的希望，不能仅仅是为了装装样子给大家看。
    现在要召开关于监督停止核试验的专家会议了，杜勒斯则又表示：会议上达成的任何协议不一定使美国承担义务停止核试验。这就是要使会议光谈判，不解决实质问题。恰巧可以用杜勒斯自己的话来说，仅仅为了装装样子给大家看。
    杜勒斯这种态度其实也不奇怪。本来，停止核试验问题，由于苏联已经主动地单方面停止了，专家会议在这个问题上达成一致协议是大有希望的。杜勒斯害怕专家们真的谈出个名堂来，于是又施展出老手法企图使专家会议毫无意义，成为一个欺骗人民的东西。说来说去，杜勒斯是万变不离其宗，就是：百般设法破坏东西方谈判，竭力阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
