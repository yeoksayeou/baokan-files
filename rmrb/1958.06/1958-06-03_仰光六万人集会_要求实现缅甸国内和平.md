Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 1st: On the morning of June 1st, over 60,000 people gathered in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, at the famous Shwedagon Pagoda, demanding the early realization of domestic peace and a peaceful and democratic resolution to the current split of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma into two factions.

This conference was jointly organized by domestic peace organizations from Rangoon, Hanthawaddy, Insein, and Bago districts. This conference is one of the largest gatherings held in Rangoon since Burmese independence. Another characteristic of the conference was that one-fifth of the participants were monks wearing yellow robes.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, Chairman of the Burmese Domestic Peace Organization, said at the meeting that domestic peace is the most urgent matter for the Burmese people, because Burma is currently in a very worrying situation. In his speech, he condemned the United States for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and also condemned the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Burma.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing hoped that both sides of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League dispute could accept the principle of "not taking advantage or suffering losses for either the government or the underground army" to restore domestic peace. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing welcomed U Nu's willingness to guarantee the implementation of the three-point policy on the restoration of domestic peace that he mentioned in his speech at the last congress of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. (Editor's note: U Nu announced the three-point policy on domestic peace: not to argue about past rights and wrongs; not to investigate past mistakes of the government and the underground; despite differences in ideology and program, to cooperate under conditions where cooperation is possible.) He asked U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein to clarify their attitude on the issue of domestic peace as well. He asked U Ba Swe and U Kyaw Nyein to abandon their "fight to the end" policy.

　　仰光六万人集会
    要求实现缅甸国内和平
    据新华社仰光1日电  在缅甸首都仰光6月1日上午有六万多人在著名的大金塔下举行大会，要求早日实现国内和平以及和平民主地解决缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟目前的分裂为两派的状况。
    这次大会是由仰光、罕礁越利、永生和勃固等县的国内和平组织联合举办的。这次大会是缅甸独立以后仰光举行的最大规模的集会之一。大会的另一个特点是有五分之一是披着黄袈裟的僧人。
    缅甸国内和平组织主席德钦哥都迈在会上说，国内和平是缅甸人民最迫切的事情，因为缅甸现在处于一种十分令人忧虑的情况中。他在讲话中谴责美国干涉印度尼西亚内政，也谴责蒋介石集团在缅甸的活动。
    德钦哥都迈希望反法西斯人民自由同盟的争执双方都能接受以“使政府和地下军双方都不占便宜和不吃亏”的原则来恢复国内和平。德钦哥都迈对于吴努愿保证实行他在反法西斯人民自由同盟上一次代表大会上讲话时所提到的恢复国内和平的三点政策表示欢迎。（编者按：吴努宣布的关于国内和平的三点政策是：不争论过去是非；不究政府和地下方面过去的错误；尽管在观念形态和纲领方面不同，但是在可能合作的条件下实行合作。）他要求吴巴瑞和吴觉迎也澄清他们在国内和平问题上的态度。他要求吴巴瑞和吴觉迎放弃他们的“战斗到底”的政策。
