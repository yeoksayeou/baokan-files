　　General Line Street Poem
    Fang Ji
    Erlang carrying mountains chasing the sun
    A carrying pole twelve feet long
    Erlang carrying mountains chasing the sun
    One end carrying industrialization
    The other carrying ten thousand catties of grain
    Industry and agriculture moving forward together
    Like both arms exerting force together
    Agriculture increases by one fold every ten years
    Industrial output value catches up
    Agricultural technology must be revolutionized
    Machines plow the land deeply
    Reservoirs everywhere, not afraid of drought
    Apply ten thousand catties of fertilizer per mu
    Large-scale industry leads the way
    Medium and small-sized industries march in unison
    Large-scale industry is like the moon in the sky
    Small-sized industries are like stars surrounding the moon
    Technology and culture engage in revolution
    Change from being both poor and ignorant
    Sharp ears, bright eyes, and clear minds
    Put politics in command and charge forward
    Small-scale production transforms into large-scale production
    Machines replace manual labor
    Electrification of urban and rural areas nationwide
    High mountains and plains are all bright
    A grand march in the cultural revolution
    Literacy and reading bring knowledge
    Pick up the pen to write articles
    Aspire to be writers and poets
    A carrying pole twelve feet long
    Erlang carrying mountains chasing the sun
    The sun isn't some British fellow
    We must race against time
    A boat sailing with the wind runs fast
    A boat sailing with the wind runs fast
    Everyone implements the General Line
    Sails unfurled, boat light, arrow released from the bow
    Water makes way, waves nod
    A boat sailing with the wind runs fast
    A hero can handle sails on all eight sides
    Regardless of the river flowing backwards
    The east wind carries me to the other shore

　　总路线街头诗
    方纪
    二郎担山赶太阳
    一条扁担丈二长
    二郎担山赶太阳
    一头挑的工业化
    一头挑的万斤粮
    工业农业同时举
    好比两膀齐用力
    农业十年加一翻
    工业产值赶上去
    农业技术要革新
    机器犁地犁得深
    水库遍地不怕旱
    每亩上它万斤肥
    大型工业打先锋
    中型小型齐出征
    大型好比天上月
    小型捧月满天星
    技术文化闹革命
    改变又白和又穷
    耳聪眼明心里亮
    政治挂帅向前冲
    小生产变大生产
    机器代替手劳动
    全国城乡电气化
    高山平原一片明
    文化革命大进军
    识字读书有学问
    抄起笔来写文章
    要当作家和诗人
    一条扁担丈二长
    二郎担山赶太阳
    太阳不是英国佬
    要和时间赛一场
    顺风船儿跑得快
    顺风船儿跑得快
    人人贯彻总路线
    帆张船轻箭离弦
    水让路来浪点头
    顺风船儿跑得快
    好汉能使八面帆
    任它江水倒转流
    东风送我登彼岸
