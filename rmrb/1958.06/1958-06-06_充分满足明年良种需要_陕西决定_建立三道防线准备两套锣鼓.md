To fully meet next year's needs for improved varieties, Shaanxi Province is launching a mass seed selection campaign, strengthening the selection, breeding, and propagation of improved varieties, and plans to have the province's main crops basically reach improved varieties next year.

The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to "establish three lines of defense and prepare two sets of gongs and drums" this year in seed propagation work to fully meet the needs of various parts of the province for improved varieties. The three lines of defense are: first, state-owned farms throughout the province will use 70% of their land to propagate improved varieties to meet the seed needs of all agricultural cooperatives' seed plots; second, agricultural cooperatives will universally establish seed plots to fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient seeds; third, each county will establish an improved variety base. The two sets of gongs and drums are: agricultural cooperatives will keep one set as needed; the state will store one set. The aim is to ensure that cooperatives have seed plots, counties have propagation zones, and the province has reserve seeds.

Currently, agricultural cooperatives are launching large-scale seed selection activities to ensure that enough seeds are retained for next year. In the Hanzhong Special Zone, where the summer harvest is earlier, seeds are being selected and retained based on soil, terrain slope, altitude, and pest conditions, using methods such as plot selection, block selection, ear selection, and single harvest, single threshing, and single storage. Agricultural cooperatives in Mian County have already selected 1,510,000 jin of Qitouhong wheat seeds and 190,000 jin of Victory rapeseed.

Various counties have also established specialized leadership organizations. Zichang and twelve other counties have established Farmers' Variety Collection Committees, designating specific personnel to be responsible for inspection and collection work. Fengxiang and forty-two other counties have collected 3,711 copies of various crop farmers' varieties after investigation and baseline studies. Hancheng and thirty other counties have collected 877 varieties, many of which are of excellent quality, high and stable yield, and have drought resistance, flood resistance, disease resistance, insect resistance, and other properties, as well as rare and valuable varieties, providing ample data for future promotion based on local conditions.

Shaanxi Province has universally established improved variety propagation bases in various counties, and established improved variety propagation zones or cooperatives according to regional natural conditions and crop distribution. Preparing seeds for next year has been included in this year's production plan and three-guarantee plan. To date, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have established more than 5 million mu of improved variety propagation land for various crops.

Shaanxi Province is one of China's improved variety propagation bases. In 1952, the area of improved varieties of various crops in the province was only 200,000 mu. Now, the sowing area of improved wheat and cotton varieties in the province has reached more than 27 million mu, basically achieving improved varieties. These improved varieties have significantly increased production after promotion and are welcomed by the masses. According to statistics, wheat has increased production by 2.4 billion jin compared to before the promotion of improved varieties, and cotton has increased production by 200,000 dan. However, because the breeding work of improved varieties cannot keep up with actual needs, wheat varieties tend to be single, which brings some difficulties to production during major agricultural seasons such as planting and harvesting. In recent years, after investigation in various places, the potential of folk improved varieties is very large. To this end, the relevant departments of Shaanxi Province have decided to quickly help agricultural cooperatives establish a formal seed system, make full use of farmers' varieties, and vigorously implement the principle of self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use. Gradually establish new crop variety combinations so that major agricultural seasons and labor and animal power arrangements can be adjusted to achieve "bumper harvests in good years and no crop failure in lean years."

### 充分满足明年良种需要  陕西决定“建立三道防线准备两套锣鼓”

　　充分满足明年良种需要
    陕西决定“建立三道防线准备两套锣鼓”
    本报讯　为明年丰收准备好种籽，陕西省正展开群众性的选种活动，加强良种的选育和繁殖工作，计划明年全省的主要农作物要基本达到良种化。
    陕西省农林厅已决定今年要在种籽繁殖工作上“建立三道防线，准备两套锣鼓”，以便充分满足本省各地对良种的需要。这三道防线是：一、全省国营农场，以70％的土地繁殖良种，满足全省所有农业社种籽地所需要的种籽；二、农业社普遍建立种籽地，以便从根本上解决种籽不足的问题；三、县县建立良种基地。两套锣鼓是：农业社按需要留一套；国家储存一套。做到社有种籽地，县有繁殖区，省有储备种籽。
    目前，各农业社正为给明年留好留够种籽，展开了大规模的选种活动。夏收较早的汉中专区，正在根据土壤、地形坡向、海拔高度以及虫害情况，用片选、块选、穗选和单收、单打、单藏的办法选留种籽。沔县的农业社，已经选出齐头红麦种一百五十一万斤，胜利油菜十九万斤。
    各县还成立了专门领导机构。子长等十二县成立了农家品种收集委员会，指定专人负责检查收集工作。凤翔等四十二县，经过调查摸底，已经征集到各种作物农家品种三千七百一十一份。韩城等三十县，已收集到八百七十七份品种，其中不少是质量优良、产量高而稳定，且具有抗旱、抗涝、抗病、抗虫等性能和品贵稀有的品种，给今后因地制宜推广，提供了充足的资料。
    陕西省各县普遍建立了良种繁殖基地，按地区自然情况和作物分布情况，建立了良种繁殖区或社。把给明年准备种籽列入了今年的生产计划和三包方案中。到现在为止，各地农业社已经建立起五百多万亩各种作物良种繁殖地。
    陕西省是我国良种繁殖基地之一。1952年，全省的各种作物，良种面积仅有二十万亩。现在，全省麦棉良种的播种面积已经达到二千七百多万亩，基本达到良种化。这些良种推广后，增产显著，受到群众欢迎。据统计，小麦即比没有推广良种前增产二十四亿斤，棉花增产二十万担。但是，由于良种的育种工作赶不上实际需要，小麦品种有趋向单一化的偏向，在种植、收获等主要农事季节上给生产带来一些困难。近年来，经过各地调查，民间良种潜力很大。为此，陕西省的有关部门决定，迅速帮助农业社建立正规的种籽制度，充分利用农家品种，大力贯彻自繁、自选、自留和自用的方针。逐步建立新的作物品种组合，使主要农事季节和劳畜力安排上得到调剂，做到“丰年丰收，歉年不歉收”。
