　　Sweep Away the Ghost of the False Foreign Devil
　　Yang Mei
　　Some people, upon hearing that we are going to surpass England in fifteen years or less, and catch up with the world's most advanced levels in science and technology, are first startled, then shrug their shoulders and sneer. Among these people, some are lackeys fed on the leftovers of capitalist countries, who instinctively detest the working people; naturally, there is no need to discuss them. But many others have reasons: our industrial level and scientific and technological level are far behind those of European and American countries, and our "scholars" and "experts" are still pitifully few. To catch up with them, how easy can it be!

　　In the eyes of these people, when it comes to science and technology, foreigners rank first, and "scholars" and "experts" who have studied abroad or in foreign schools in China rank second. As for those unsophisticated working people, they are not qualified to talk about science and technology. In a word: native is inferior to foreign.

　　The theory that "native is inferior to foreign" was once a bestseller in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. At that time, foreign guns and cannons frightened the feudal ruling class; foreign bread and foreign ham made the compradors and lackeys greedy. In the eyes of these people, the moon in China was not as good as the one in America, and China only had "poverty, disease, ignorance, weakness, and selfishness." They always hated that their noses were shorter than those of foreigners, and that their skin was yellow. It would have been fine if they had only lamented their own misfortune, but they also had to propagate this spirit of slavery to the masses, and it even deceived many young people. Even now, the ghost of the false foreign devil has not dissipated from their bodies; whenever they encounter a competition with capitalist countries, they mutter: "Native is inferior to foreign."

　　But the working people do not buy this. We suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal rulers in the past, lived a difficult and hard life, and lost the opportunity to receive education. Precisely because of this, we have accumulated abundant revolutionary power, and have continuously radiated dazzling light in the hundred-year history of China. As early as the First Opium War, the Chinese people carried out a heroic struggle against the British. In the subsequent Taiping Rebellion and the Boxer Rebellion, the masses more loudly shouted: "The emperor is afraid of foreigners, and foreigners are afraid of the people." Yes, the conscious Chinese people have always made foreign invaders afraid.

　　The Chinese people have always been diligent, brave, unwilling to lag behind, and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors created and invented silk, textiles, compasses, papermaking, printing, gunpowder, porcelain, and many other very useful things for all mankind in their labor. The liberated Chinese people are even more like lively dragons and tigers. Since the all-round Great Leap Forward, new creations and technological innovations have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and good news has been pouring in. This spring, among the more than 1,300 kinds of industrial products in Shanghai whose quality was lower than that of similar products in Britain or other capitalist countries, 227 kinds have already caught up with or surpassed them. A few days ago, even more good news came that the variety of reactive dyes has surpassed Britain and ranks first in the world.

　　Countless facts tell us: where there is labor, there is creation; to create, one must labor. Since people have created the world through their own labor, they can also create a brand new future with their own hands. What's more, in addition to having the same hands and brains as foreigners, the Chinese people also have the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, which many capitalist countries do not have. We have many advanced cities like Shanghai! We also have many advanced factories like the Luoyang Mechanical Plant! We have even more diligent, brave, intelligent and resourceful workers and peasants! Tens of millions of workers and hundreds of millions of peasants are marching forward heroically. What we are seeing now is just a small display of their talents.

　　Our socialist construction cause is truly making the whole country seethe, making friends cheer, and shocking enemies. It will also surely shatter the "native is inferior to foreign" dream of a few people. In fact, the question of native and foreign also varies from person to person. In our view, we are "native" and capitalist countries are "foreign"; in their view, they are "native" and China is "foreign," and the Chinese people are their "foreigners." Those who advocate "native is inferior to foreign" in China, if they still stubbornly cling to their granite heads, might as well go and sigh for capitalist countries that "native is inferior to foreign."

　　扫清假洋鬼子的阴魂
　　杨眉
    有些人一听说我们要在十五年或者更短的时间内超过英国，在科学技术方面要赶上世界最先进的水平，始而吓一跳，继而耸耸肩，冷笑一声。这些人中，有的是靠资本主义国家的残羹剩饭喂大了的洋奴，从来就本能地敌视劳动人民的，自然不消说得。但也有不少人是有根有据的：我们的工业水平和科学技术水平比欧美国家差得很远，我国的“学者”、“专家”也还少得可怜。要赶人家，谈何容易！
    在这些人看来，要讲科学技术，外国人数第一，在国外留过学或在国内上过洋学堂的“学者”和“专家”数第二。至于那些土里土气的劳动人民，是没有资格谈什么科学技术的。总之一句话：土不如洋。
    “土不如洋”的理论，曾经是半封建、半殖民地的旧中国里的畅销货。那时候，洋枪洋炮吓破了封建统治阶级的胆；洋面包、洋火腿吃得洋奴买办嘴馋。在这些人看来，中国的月亮也不如美国的好，中国只有“贫、病、愚、弱、私”。他们总是恨自己鼻子比洋人长得矮，皮肤生得黄。他们自怨自艾倒也罢了，可是还要向群众宣传这种奴隶精神，也居然曾经迷惑了很多青年。直到现在，在他们身上，假洋鬼子的阴魂还没有散，一碰到要同资本主义国家较量的时候，他们就念念有词：“土不如洋”。
    可是劳动人民是不买这本账的。我们过去受尽了帝国主义和封建统治者的压迫和剥削，过着艰难困苦的生活，丧失了受教育的机会。正因为如此，我们才积累了充沛的革命力量，在百年来的中国历史上不断地放射出耀眼的光芒。早在第一次鸦片战争时期，中国人民就进行过英勇的抗英斗争。在以后的太平天国革命和义和团起义中，群众更响亮地喊出了：“皇帝怕洋人，洋人怕百姓。”是的，有觉悟的中国人民从来就叫外国侵略者害怕的。
    中国的人民，一向是勤劳勇敢，不甘落后、并且是敢想、敢说、敢做的。在千百年前，我们的祖先就在劳动中为全人类创造发明了蚕丝、纺织、指南针、造纸术、印刷术、火药、瓷器等等非常有用的东西。解放了的中国人民，更是如生龙活虎一般，全面大跃进以来，新的创造发明和技术革新有如雨后春笋，捷报频传。在今年春季，上海全市低于英国或其他资本主义国家同类工业产品质量的一千三百多种产品中，就有二百二十七种已经赶上或超过了它们。前两天更传来了活性染料的品种已经超过英国跃居世界首位的喜讯。
    数不完的事实告诉我们：有劳动，就有创造；要创造，就要劳动。人既然靠自己的劳动创造了世界，人也能依靠自己的双手创造崭新的未来。何况中国人民除了有着同洋人一样的手和脑以外，还有着很多资本主义国家所没有的共产党的领导和社会主义制度。像上海那样的先进城市，我们多着呢！像洛阳机械厂那样的先进工厂，我们也多着呢！勤劳勇敢、聪明机智的工人和农民，我们更多着呢！千万的工人，上亿的农民，正豪迈地大步前进。现在的这些，只不过小试锋芒而已。
    我们的社会主义建设事业，真是使举国沸腾，使朋友欢呼，使敌人震惊。也一定会惊破少数人的“土不如洋”的迷梦。其实，土和洋的问题，也是因人而异。在我们看来，我们是“土”，资本主义国家是“洋”；在他们看来，他们是“土”，中国就是“洋”，中国人民也就是他们的“洋人”了。中国的“土不如洋”论者如果还死抱住花冈岩的头脑，还不如去为资本主义国家叹息“土不如洋”吧。
