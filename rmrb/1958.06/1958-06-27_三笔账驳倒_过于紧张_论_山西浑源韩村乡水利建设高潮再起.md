Three Accounts Refute the "Overly Tense" Argument
Water Conservancy Construction Upsurge Rises Again in Hancun Township, Hunyuan, Shanxi

Some people say that increasing the speed of construction will make people "overly tense," and it is better to be slower. But, isn't it tense to be slow? We must know that hundreds of millions of people have been in a state of poverty and lack of culture for a long time, struggling to maintain a very low standard of living with great effort, unable to effectively resist natural disasters, unable to quickly stop possible foreign aggression, and completely in a passive position where they cannot control their own destiny. That is a terrible state of tension. In order to get rid of that situation, hundreds of millions of people are going all out and throwing themselves into enthusiastic labor and struggle with full confidence. This is a revolutionary routine that we should welcome with both hands.
-- Working Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress

(Our Newspaper Correspondent Yao Wenjin) Shanxi Hunyuan Hancun Township recently held a major debate to refute the "overly tense" argument and once again set off a high tide of water conservancy construction that is faster, better, and more economical.

The two major water conservancy projects jointly undertaken by the thirteen agricultural cooperatives in Hunyuan Hancun Township: one is the Hongshui Gou Reservoir, which can store 1.04 million cubic meters of water, and the other is the 16-li-long Shenxi Canal, were originally scheduled to be completed before the flood season. Due to the attack of the "overly tense" argument, the project was once paralyzed. Many people felt that: the township had already built two reservoirs and twelve canals this spring, and fertilizer had also quadrupled. This year's Great Leap Forward was already no problem, so there was no need to work as hard as before. They said, "Too much tension, people can't stand it," "If we finish everything this year, what will we do next year?" "We've been fighting hard all spring, it's time to take a break and relax"... Cooperatives that did not directly benefit felt that this was someone else's business, and they didn't need to be "tense" for others. Therefore, the Hongshui Gou Reservoir, which needed 1,000 people to work, only had 300 people working every day, and the Shenxi Canal also decreased from 400 people at the start of construction to 190 people.

In order to reverse this situation, the Hancun Township Committee of the Communist Party of China organized thirteen cooperative secretaries, cooperative directors, and 111 production team leaders from the township on May 31 to launch a debate on the two lines at the construction site – whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, or to settle for less, slower, worse, and more expensive results?

In the debate, the township party committee led everyone in calculating three accounts: The first account started from the township's economic situation. Since liberation, production has greatly developed, but it still requires great effort to barely maintain a very low standard of living. In the face of natural disasters, we are completely in a passive position where we cannot control our own destiny. Therefore, we are always engaged in disaster relief every other year, and people are worried about the grain problem every time during the period of food shortage. "Are we content with this situation and not strive to change it in the shortest possible time?" The township party committee raised the question.

The second account is that if these two reservoirs are completed before the flood season, the newly added and improved irrigation area will be 12,000 mu, and 5,000 mu can benefit in the current year. Calculating on the basis of an increase of 130 jin of grain per mu, it can increase the production of 650,000 jin of grain.

The third account is how much loss will be if the project is not completed before the flood season? In this way, the 400 mu of good land occupied by the canal will not be compensated at all in the current year, and the more than 15,000 workdays that have been spent on the reservoir and canal are equal to abandoning all previous efforts. In particular, because of building a "half-finished" reservoir, it will actually accumulate floods, and once the flood is released from the reservoir, several villages and thousands or tens of thousands of mu of land may be swallowed by floods.

After calculating these three accounts, people's minds became clear, and they were inspired with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. The question of whether to do it or not was resolved. But, how to do it? The township party committee proposed to be both wise and brave, so as to achieve both work and rest, both fast and slow, and carry out the battle rhythmically. To this end, after everyone contributed ideas and discussions, eight measures were adopted: realizing the motorization of transportation - borrowing eight small trains and 52 rails from nearby coal mines, changing from manual carrying of soil and stone to train pulling; using cattle-drawn stone rollers to speed up the compaction speed; building woodworking workshops on the construction site and installing blacksmith furnaces to repair tools at any time; relying on the masses to obtain materials locally and burn lime locally, etc. In addition, the project design progress was re-examined, and the projects that could not play a role in the current year were postponed, and efforts were currently focused on completing the part that could prevent drought and flood control in the current year. According to the characteristics of the project, labor was rationally arranged, so that men, women, old and young all had suitable work to do, so as to achieve a double victory in production and infrastructure construction.

The thought of more, faster, better, and more economical brought about more, faster, better, and more economical measures, and more, faster, better, and more economical measures brought about a faster, better, and more economical construction speed. The number of people working on the Shenxi Canal increased from the original 190 to 500, and the Hongshui Gou Reservoir increased from the original 300 to 998; Hongshui Gou used to transport 800 cubic meters of soil per day, and now it has increased to 2,500 cubic meters. Now the members of the cooperative have named the Hongshui Gou Reservoir the "July 1st" Reservoir, and they are determined to complete it before "July 1st" and use it as a gift to welcome the birthday of the Party.

    三笔账驳倒“过于紧张”论
    山西浑源韩村乡水利建设高潮再起
    有些人说，提高建设速度，会使人们“过于紧张”，宁可慢一点好。但是，难道慢一点就不紧张么？要知道，六亿多人长期处在贫穷和缺少文化的状况下，用很大的努力才能勉强维持很低的生活水平，不能有效地抵抗自然灾害，不能迅速地制止可能的外来侵略，完全处于不能掌握自己命运的被动地位，那才是一种可怕的紧张局面。为了摆脱那种局面，几万万人鼓起干劲，满怀信心地投入热烈的劳动和斗争中，这是我们应当双手欢迎的一种革命的常规。
    ——中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告
    本报讯　记者姚文锦报道：山西浑源韩村乡最近举行一次大辩论，驳倒“过于紧张”论，再次掀起多快好省的水利建设高潮。
    浑源韩村乡十三个农业社联合兴办的两大水利工程：一个是可蓄一百零四万方水的红水沟水库，一个是长达十六里的神溪大渠，原订于汛期前完工。由于遇到“过于紧张”论的进攻，曾使工程一度瘫痪下来。许多人觉得：全乡在今春已经修成了两个水库和十二条水渠，肥料也翻了四番，今年的大跃进已经不成问题了，因而不需要再像以前那样紧张地干了。他们说，“过于紧张，人受不了啦”，“今年都干完了，明年干啥呀”，“苦战了一春啦，也该歇一歇、省省心了”……不直接受益的社则觉得这是别人的事，自己犯不着为别人“紧张”。因此需要千人作工的红水沟水库每天才有三百人出工，神溪大渠也由开工时的四百人减到一百九十人。
    为了扭转这种局势，中共韩村乡党委于5月31日组织全乡十三个社支书、社主任和一百一十一个生产队长，在工地上展开了两条路线的论战——是要多快好省呢，还是宁可少慢差费呢？
    在辩论中，乡党委领导大家算了三笔账：头一笔从本乡的经济情况算起。解放以来，生产是大大发展了，但仍需要很大的努力才能勉强维持很低的生活水平，在自然灾害面前，完全处于不能掌握自己命运的被动地位。因此，左一年右一年老是个搞救灾，每到青黄不接时期人们就为粮食问题而焦虑。“难道我们安于这种状况，而不力求在最短的时间加以改变吗？”乡党委提出了问题。
    第二笔账是：汛前搞成这两个水库，新增和改善的灌溉面积有一万二千亩，当年可有五千亩受益，以每亩增产一百三十斤粮食计算，能增产六十五万斤粮食。
    第三笔账是，汛前完不成工程，损失将有多大？这样，开渠占去的四百亩良田当年得不到一点弥补，已经在水库水渠上花去的一万五千多工等于前功尽弃，特别是因为修了个“半途而废”的水库，反使洪水积聚起来了，一旦洪水出库，几个村子和几千几万亩土地就有被洪水吞噬的可能。
    这三笔账一算，人们的头脑清醒了，鼓起了冲天的革命干劲。干不干的问题解决了。可是，怎么来干呢？乡党委提出要智勇双全，从而作到有劳有逸，有缓有急，有节奏地进行战斗。为此，经过大家献计、讨论之后，采取了八项措施：运输实现车子化——从附近的煤矿上借来了八辆小火车，五十二条铁轨，由人抬土、抬石料变为火车拉；用牛拉碌碓来加快夯实的速度；工地上还搭起木工作坊，安上了铁匠炉子，随时修理工具；依靠群众就地取材就地烧石灰等。此外，重新审查了工程设计进度，把当年不能发生作用的工程推迟搞，目前集中力量完成当年就能抗旱防洪的部分。根据工程的特长，合理安排了劳力，使男女老少都有合适的活干，从而作到生产、基建双胜利。
    多快好省的思想带来了多快好省的措施，多快好省的措施又带来多快好省的建设速度。神溪大渠的出勤人数由原来的一百九十人增到五百人，红水沟水库则由原来的三百人增到九百九十八人；红水沟过去每日运土八百方，现在已增到两千五百方。现在社员们把红水沟水库定名为“七一”水库，他们决心在“七一”前完工，并以此作为迎接党的生日的献礼。
