Living in a Country of Gentlemen
    Chen Beiou

    After being sick for a few days, I didn't expect everything to have changed when I stepped out of my house. The streets were filled with gongs and drums promoting the General Line, and free street plays were being performed everywhere. As soon as I got on the tram, four or five young people, seeing me coughing and wheezing, all eagerly offered me their seats. I forgot to bring a handkerchief, and my mouth was full of phlegm from coughing. Just as I was worrying about what to do, a Young Pioneer gave me a small paper bag. Then the conductor handed me a picture album and even asked if I wanted some water.

    Upon entering the hospital, the nurse asked me to take my temperature. I said, "My medical record hasn't arrived yet?" She said, "It doesn't matter, you seem to be coughing so badly, the sooner you take your temperature, the sooner you can see a doctor." Sure enough, as soon as I finished taking my temperature, my medical record arrived, and I saw a doctor without waiting. It turned out that the hospital had switched to a three-shift system, where you could see a doctor from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. They really are thinking of the patients in every way.

    The next day, I went to see the doctor again, this time by bicycle. When I finished seeing the doctor and paid three cents to retrieve my bike, I was asked to come back. A strong old man returned one cent to me, saying that storing the bike now only costs two cents.

    Truly, seven days in the mountains feel like a thousand years in the world. I suddenly felt like I was living in a country even more wonderful than the Country of Gentlemen in "Flowers in the Mirror".

    生活在君子国里
    陈北鸥
    病了几天，不料一出家门，一切都变了样，街上打锣打鼓宣传总路线，到处演着不要票的街头剧。才上电车，有四五位青年看到我又咳嗽又气喘，就都争着让座位。我忘记了带手帕，咳嗽的满口是痰，正苦于没有办法，一位红领巾送给了我一个小纸袋，接着售票员递给了我画报，还问我要不要喝水。
    进了医院，护士要我试体温表，我说：“病历还没有来呢？”她说：“不要紧，您咳嗽的怪难受，早点试早点看病。果然试完表，病历也来了，没有等，就看上了病。原来医院改了三班制，从早上七点直到下午七点都可以看病。真是处处为病人设想了。
    第二天又去看病，这次我是骑自行车去的。当我看完病交三分钱取走车子的时候，又被请回去了。一位健壮的老人交回我一分钱，说存车只要二分钱了。
    真是，山中方七日，世上已千年。我忽然想到好像生活在比“镜花缘”里的君子国更美好的国度里。
