A Fighting Call to Implement the Spirit of the General Line
    Xinjiang Will Be Built into an Industrial Base of the Motherland
    Reclaim More Wasteland, Plant More Cotton, and Accelerate the Development of Agricultural Production
    (Our Newspaper) News: To strive to build Xinjiang into a base for the motherland's steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, textiles, sugar and other industries and a cotton planting base within ten years, this is the fighting call made by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China to the entire party and more than five million people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region in order to implement the general line of socialist construction. This call was made by Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Saifuddin, Secretary, on the 7th on behalf of the Autonomous Region Party Committee when they conveyed the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.
    Wang Enmao and Saifuddin both focused on the issue of how the autonomous region should implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party in the last part of their reports. Wang Enmao said: The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party has formulated the general line of socialist construction. Our implementation of the spirit of the meeting is to implement this general line. This is the central task of our party and people of all ethnic groups. To this end, he pointed out that the following work must be done well:
    First, a propaganda and study movement of the general line must be launched immediately to ensure that everyone receives an education on the general line, so that under the encouragement of the general line, they will be truly inspired, strive for the best, and build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, so that the socialist construction of the autonomous region will leap forward again and again.
    Second, the rectification movement must be completed from top to bottom, especially the movement against local nationalism. The autonomous region has achieved the victory of the socialist revolution on the ownership of the means of production, that is, on the economic front, and has also achieved the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In terms of opposing local nationalism, the enlarged meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee has achieved a decisive victory, and now it is necessary to completely complete this task and achieve a complete victory.
    Third, we must firmly grasp the production and construction work of the autonomous region and continue to push the great leap forward of socialist construction to a new climax.
    In terms of agricultural production, we must not only strive for a bumper harvest this year, but also prepare early to strive for an even greater bumper harvest next year. Wang Enmao emphatically pointed out that the central link in developing agricultural production in the autonomous region lies in reclaiming more wasteland and planting more cotton. In the next ten years, the autonomous region will be built into a high-yield cotton planting base. Strive to reclaim eight million mu of wasteland this year. In line with the reclamation of wasteland, we must also build water conservancy projects. The natural conditions of the autonomous region are particularly conducive to the development of cotton planting, and we must strive for the best in this regard and strive to be the first in the country.
    There must also be a great leap forward in animal husbandry. In this regard, we must start a competition with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    In terms of industry, it is required that the total industrial output value exceeds the total agricultural output value during the second five-year plan period. Wang Enmao said that we should have such an ideal and strive to build the autonomous region into a base for steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, textiles, sugar and other industries within ten years. He asked party committees at all levels to formulate their own plans, muster their energy, and strive for the best.
    Fourth, we must carry out the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. In terms of technical revolution, the central content of agricultural production is to gradually realize mechanization in farming. In terms of transportation, we must gradually implement vehicleization, using automobiles on the one hand, and using horse-drawn carriages and other vehicles at the same time. In terms of agricultural product processing, we must gradually implement mechanization, so that cotton ginning, oil pressing, flour milling, rice milling, etc. are changed from handicrafts to mechanization, or a combination of machinery and manual labor. Increase rural power equipment, establish rural power grids, and gradually realize rural electrification.
    In terms of cultural revolution, we will also accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, popularize elementary education, develop agricultural middle schools, eliminate the four pests, eliminate diseases, pay attention to hygiene, and greatly develop the population of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region. Vigorously develop art and cultural undertakings. Strive to not only fundamentally change the economic outlook of the autonomous region during the second five-year plan period, but also fundamentally change the cultural outlook.
    Finally, Wang Enmao called on cadres of all ethnic groups to study Chairman Mao's works, ideological methods, leadership methods, and work style. He said that studying Chairman Mao's works and learning Chairman Mao's ideological methods are our important tasks and the key to doing our work well.

    贯彻总路线精神的一个战斗号召
    新疆将建成为祖国工业基地
    多开荒地多种棉花加速发展农业生产
    本报讯　争取在十年以内，把新疆建设成为祖国的钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、纺织、制糖等工业的基地和植棉基地，这是中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会向自治区全党和五百多万各族人民为贯彻社会主义建设总路线所提出的战斗号召。这个号召是自治区党委第一书记王恩茂和书记赛福鼎7日在他们传达党的“八大”二次会议精神时代表自治区党委提出的。
    王恩茂和赛福鼎在他们传达报告的最后一部分，都着重讲了自治区如何贯彻执行党的“八大”二次会议精神的问题。王恩茂说：党的“八大”二次会议已经制定了社会主义建设的总路线，我们贯彻会议的精神，也就是贯彻这条总路线，这是我们党和各族人民的中心任务。为此，他指出必须作好如下工作：
    首先，要立即开展一个总路线的宣传运动和学习运动，使每一个人都要受到一次总路线的教育，从而在总路线的鼓舞下，真正鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，使自治区的社会主义建设事业跃进，再跃进。
    其次，要自上而下地完成整风运动，特别是完成反对地方民族主义的运动。自治区已经取得了生产资料所有制即经济战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，也取得了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利。在反对地方民族主义方面，自治区党委扩大会议已取得了决定性的胜利，现在要彻底完成这一任务，取得完满的胜利。
    第三，要抓紧自治区的生产建设工作，把社会主义建设的大跃进继续推向新的高潮。
    在农业生产方面，不仅要争取今年的丰收，还要及早准备争取明年更大的丰收。王恩茂着重指出，自治区发展农业生产的中心环节，在于多开荒地和多种植棉花。在今后十年内把自治区建成为一个高产的植棉基地。今年力争开荒八百万亩。与开荒相适应的，还要兴修水利。自治区的自然条件特别有利于发展植棉事业，在这一点上要力争上游，力争居于全国第一位。
    在畜牧业方面也必须大跃进。在这方面要同内蒙古自治区展开竞赛。
    在工业方面，要求第二个五年计划期内，工业总产值超过农业总产值。王恩茂说，我们应当有这样的理想，争取在十年内，把自治区建设成为钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、纺织、制糖等工业的基地。他要求各级党委制定自己的计划，鼓足干劲，力争上游。
    第四，要开展技术革命和文化革命。在技术革命方面，要求农业生产在耕作方面，逐步实现机械化，这是技术革命的中心内容。在运输方面要逐步车子化，一方面使用汽车，另一方面同时使用马车及其他车子。在农产品加工方面要逐步实行机械化，使轧花、榨油、磨面、碾米等，由手工业改为机械化，或机械与手工相结合。增加农村动力设备，建立农村发电网，逐步实现农村电气化。
    在文化革命方面，也将加快消灭文盲、普及小学教育、发展农业中学、消灭四害、消灭疾病、讲究卫生，大量发展自治区各族人民的人口。大力发展艺术文化事业。争取在第二个五年计划期间，不仅根本改变自治区的经济面貌，而且根本改变文化面貌。
    最后，王恩茂号召各族干部要学习毛主席的著作、思想方法、领导方法和工作作风。他说，学习毛主席的著作，学习毛主席的思想方法，这是我们的重要任务，是做好工作的关键。
