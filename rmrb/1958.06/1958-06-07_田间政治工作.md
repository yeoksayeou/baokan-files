　　Political Work in the Fields
　　Li Youxiu, Director of Wuliting Agricultural Production Cooperative, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province.
　　The natural conditions of the Wuliting Agricultural Cooperative in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, are relatively poor. During the Great Leap Forward, we put forward the battle cry of "Not afraid of poor natural conditions, determined to achieve a thousand-jin cooperative." According to our cooperative's comprehensive leap forward plan for this year, the need for labor days has almost doubled compared to last year. At the same time, under the circumstances of a comprehensive leap forward, all tasks must leap forward. In addition to tense labor production, the members have meetings every night, and the meeting content is abundant, and the meetings are long, making everyone exhausted. Consequently, the members generally reflected: "The Great Leap Forward is good, but we can't stand staying up all night." At this time, the county party committee promptly gave us instructions that we must reduce evening meetings and carry out mass political activities in the fields.

　　Integrating Production, Field Debates

　　Since the Double-Anti Movement, the cooperative has launched diverse and flexible debates. The cooperative's cadres consciously guide the masses to carry out debates during collective labor in the fields. For example, cooperative member Xie Wufeng had objections to the cooperative's collective pig raising plan, saying that collective pig raising would lose money and reduce cooperative members' income. During field labor, this issue was discussed, and later, after everyone calculated the benefits of pig raising, she was convinced. When subscribing to public bonds, debates were also held in the fields, with the topic being "Why buy public bonds?" Female cooperative member Xu Yuelian said: "To run schools and factories, and build socialism, we can't rely on the government alone, we also need everyone's help." Zhong Fengxiu said: "If the government needs money, it can just print a few more paper bills, why ask the common people to buy public bonds? Besides, running factories and schools has nothing to do with me." At that time, many people said, "If the state issues too many bills and production can't keep up, what will happen then?" One cooperative member pointed at Zhong Fengxiu and said, "Isn't your son studying in Wuhan at a school run by the government! Otherwise, where would he go to study?" This sentence refuted Zhong Fengxiu, and she said with shame, "Okay, I will also buy two yuan of public bonds to support national construction." Female cooperative member Chen Jiaodi usually did work by choosing the light and fearing the heavy, and she had a good reason, saying, "You do the heavy work, I won't be jealous of getting more work points." When discussing labor discipline, everyone raised objections to her, and she even argued strongly with everyone. Her husband, listening on the side, couldn't bear it and said to her, "If you don't change, we'll each manage our own affairs. If you choose to do light work and get fewer work points, you'll suffer after the dividend distribution in the future, see what you'll do?" Later, Chen Jiaodi corrected herself and went to the county with everyone to carry manure, three to four times a day.

　　It's a Study Card and a Political Mobilization Card

　　Bringing study cards (writing on small blackboards) to the fields is a good way to solve the problem of both production and literacy. Study cards are not only tools for teaching farmers to read, but can also play a role in political mobilization. For example, when the seedlings of our cooperative were three inches tall, we wrote "Today Weeding Rice Fields" on the study card, teaching everyone to read the words and explaining the agricultural work to be done today. At this time, cooperative members with ideological resistance would inevitably express their inner thoughts, and ideological work could be done on them. For example, female cooperative member Xie Gengxiu said, "Since ancient times, I've never heard of weeding rice fields when the seedlings are three inches tall." Female team leader Cai Lianxiu explained, "Pulling out the unwanted seedlings early will prevent them from wasting fertilizer, remove barnyard grass, and prevent insects." This convinced Xie Gengxiu, and everyone actively weeded the rice fields.

　　Many Benefits of Field Political Activities

　　In summary, field political activities have the following benefits:

　　First, they reduce evening meetings, allowing cooperative members to have adequate rest time to recover their strength for better labor; second, they can bring the instructions of higher authorities and the decisions of the cooperative management committee to the masses in a timely manner, combining production technology measures with practical actions; third, conducting activities in field operations brings in more people than evening meetings, educating a wider range and allowing for thorough airing of views and in-depth debates; fourth, this form is easily accepted by the masses, as it is a custom for them to work, talk, and sing mountain songs, so debating while working doesn't feel sudden; fifth, after carrying out field political activities, the number of unprincipled disputes among cooperative members has greatly decreased, and problems are also resolved in the fields, no longer requiring cooperative cadres; especially women, who used to speak less at meetings and spread gossip behind their backs, causing disputes at every turn; now, with field debates, they say everything, distinguish right from wrong at any time, advanced and backward ideas clash at any time, the political atmosphere is strong, and idle gossip is greatly reduced; sixth, field political activities must strengthen the cultivation and education of key personnel, and the bottom line and methods must be explained to the key personnel. The cultivation of key personnel should be broad, including men, women, old and young, and they must be good at grasping the focus of the issue and breaking the dull atmosphere, so that field political activities can be enlivened.

### 田间政治工作

　　田间政治工作
    江西兴国县五里亭农业生产合作社主任　李友秀
    江西省兴国县五里亭农业社的自然条件较差。在大跃进中，我们提出了“不怕自然条件差，决心实现千斤社”的战斗口号。根据我社今年全面跃进的计划，劳动日的需要几乎比去年增加了一倍。同时在全面跃进情况下，各项工作都要跃进，社员们除了紧张的劳动生产外，每天晚上都有会开，而且会议内容很多，会也开的长，搞的大家疲劳不堪。因之社员们普遍反映：“大跃进好是好，就是熬夜熬不了。”这时候县委及时给了我们指示，一定要减少晚上开会，开展群众性的田间政治活动。
    结合生产　田间辩论
    双反运动以来，社里开展了多样灵活的辩论会，社的干部有意识地引导群众在田间集体劳动时开展辩论。如社员谢五凤对社里集体养猪计划有意见，说集体养猪会亏本，会减少社员收入。在田间劳动时，就这个问题进行讨论，后来经过大家算养猪的好处账，她才信服了。在认购公债时，也在田间进行辩论，题目是“为什么要购公债？”女社员徐月莲说：“要办学校办工厂，建设社会主义，单靠政府没有那样多钱，还要靠大家。”锺凤秀说：“政府要钱，多印几张纸票就行了，何必要老百姓买公债？再说办工厂办学校，对我也没有什么关系。”当时很多人就说：“国家发票子多了，生产赶不上，那时怎么办？”有一个社员指着锺凤秀说：“现在你儿子在武汉读书，不是政府办的学校么！不然他到哪里去读书呀？”这一句话把锺凤秀驳倒了，她羞愧地说：“好，我也买二元公债支援国家建设。”女社员陈姣弟平时做工夫挑轻怕重，还很有理由似的说：“重的你们做嘛，多得工分我也不眼红。”在讨论劳动纪律时，大家对她提出意见，她还与大家强辩。她的丈夫在旁听着气不过了，冲着她说：“你要不改，我们二人各管各的，你挑轻活做，工分少，将来分红后你就苦了，看你怎么办？”后来陈姣弟改正了，和大家一起到县里去挑粪，一天挑三次到四次。
    是学习牌又是政治鼓动牌
    把学习牌（小黑板上写字）带到田间去，这是解决生产扫盲两不误的良好办法。学习牌不仅是教农民识字的工具，也能起到政治鼓动的作用。如我社在秧长三寸时，便在学习牌上写：“今天捡秧田”，教大家认字，同时说明今天要做的农活。这时候有思想抵触的社员，不免要说出心里话，就可以对他进行思想工作。如女社员谢庚秀就说：“自古以来就没听说过秧长三寸时就要捡秧田。”女队长蔡连秀就解释说：“把不要的禾苗早点拔掉，便不会浪费肥料，又除净稗草，又好防虫。”这样就把谢庚秀说服了，大家也都积极捡起秧田来。田间政治活动好处多
    田间政治活动，概括起来有如下好处：
    一、减少晚间开会，使社员有适当休息时间恢复体力，以便更好的再劳动；二、能把上级指示和社管委会的决议及时地和广大群众见面，使生产技术措施与实际行动相结合；三、在田间作业中进行活动，比晚上开会到的人多，教育面广，能鸣放得透，辩论得深刻；四、这种形式群众易于接受，边干活，边说话，边唱山歌，本来是群众固有的习惯，因此边干活边辩论也并不感到突然；五、开展了田间政治活动后，社员之间一些无原则的纠纷大大减少，出现问题也在田间解决，不再找社干部了；特别是妇女们过去在会上发言少，有意见背后乱说，动不动就闹纠纷；现在田间辩论，什么话都说，随时分辩是非，先进思想和落后思想随时交锋，政治空气浓厚了，闲是闲非也就大大减少了；六、田间政治活动一定要加强对骨干的培养教育，要向骨干交底交办法。培养骨干要广泛，男女老少都要有，要善于掌握问题焦点，善于打破沉闷空气，这样就能使田间政治活动活跃起来。
