Real People, Real Events, Clear Contrast, Lively and Vivid
Sangzhuang Township's Skillful Propaganda of the General Line

(Reported by this newspaper) Sangzhuang Township, Leling County, Shandong Province, uses real people and real events to promote the general line, in a lively and vivid form, which is praised by the masses.

In order to publicize and implement the general line, Sangzhuang Township recently held an exhibition in Xibu Village. Thirty exhibition sheds were filled with cartoons, charts, objects, poems, and big-character posters, all with local real people and real events as content. The narrators were all local teachers, cadres, and activists, some of whom were the people involved. The visiting commune members, after seeing the vivid facts, watched, listened, and discussed, receiving a profound education on the general line.

The first part of the exhibition consisted of twelve cartoons depicting two kinds of people, two kinds of attitudes, and two kinds of effects. The most striking were two cartoons: one depicting a commune member with a smiling face, looking at the boundless wheat field; the other depicting a commune member with a mourning face guarding patches of wheat with missing seedlings and broken ridges. It turned out that this was a comparison of the wheat of Sun Xishun and Sun Chang'en's production teams in Xibu Village. Sun Xishun's team listened to the Party and planted more than 200 mu of wheat with wide ridges and dense planting, with an average yield of at least 200 jin per mu; Sun Chang'en's team had serious conservative thinking, and as a result, many of the seeds they planted were eaten by insects, resulting in missing seedlings and broken ridges, with a yield of only 40 jin per mu. The team's 195 mu of wheat yielded 31,200 jin less than Sun Xishun's team. This accounting awakened the visitors. Wan Changsheng, the captain of Tieying Village, said: "Conservative thinking kills people. With the same conditions, there is a world of difference. If we don't oppose conservative thinking, we won't be able to lead production in the future."

The second part of the exhibition praised the leaping pioneers on various fronts. Among them, there were 750 big-character posters. The people praised included Sun Wenqin, a model commune member who loved the commune like her home, the mother of Gao Baowan, a model pig breeder, and Sun Yulan, the Party branch secretary of Yang Youjia Village who was good at labor. In this exhibition shed full of socialist atmosphere, people received a very profound education. Many visitors said: "If everyone loves the commune like this, how can the commune not be run well?"

The third part of the exhibition criticized the facts of some commune members being selfish, individualistic, and having a poor attitude towards labor. On display here were the agricultural tools of Sanfangjia Village, a Liberation-style waterwheel with the waterwheel cap missing, the waterwheel cylinder split into five pieces, and the gears and waterwheel frame grown together. In addition, there was a seven-inch plow with an inch-thick layer of rust and soil on it. The visitors immediately composed a quick rhythm ballad: "Some commune members are too biased, treating the collective and the individual differently. The exhibited objects are a mirror, everyone should go back and look at their faces."

The fourth part of the exhibition was this year's leap forward plan for all 25 villages in the township. After the implementation of this plan, this township will become a land of fish and rice.

The fifth part was a special column for big-character posters. This is a place to express determination, show enthusiasm, make suggestions, and offer advice.

Many people who saw the exhibition said that under the illumination of the general line, they would work harder to promote production to leap forward again and again.

    人真事实　对比鲜明　生动活泼
    桑庄乡宣传总路线方法巧妙
    本报讯　山东省乐陵县桑庄乡用真人实事宣传总路线，形式生动活泼，群众满口称赞。
    桑庄乡为了宣传、贯彻总路线，不久前在西堡村举办了一个展览会。三十间展览棚里，布满了漫画、图表、实物、诗歌、大字报，内容都是本地的真人实事。讲解的人都是本村教员、干部、积极分子，有的就是当事人。参观的社员们，看了活生生的事实，边看、边听、边议论，受到了一次深刻的总路线教育。
    展览会的第一部分，是十二幅两种人、两种态度、两种效果的漫画。最引人注意的有二幅漫画：一幅是一个满面含笑的社员，眼望着一望无边的丰产小麦；另一幅是一个社员哭丧着脸守着一块块缺苗断垅的小麦。原来这是西堡村孙西顺和孙长恩两个生产队的小麦对比。孙西顺队听党的话，二百多亩小麦，都是宽垅密植，平均每亩最低能产二百斤；孙长恩队存有严重的保守思想，结果下的种子好多都被虫子吃掉了，缺苗断垅，每亩只能收四十斤。全队一百九十五亩小麦，比孙西顺队少收三万一千二百多斤。这笔账惊醒了参观的人们，铁营村队长万长胜说：“保守思想害死人，同样的条件，真有天上地下的差别，不反掉保守思想，今后是没法领导生产的。”
    展览会的第二部分，表扬了各个战线上的跃进尖兵。其中光大字报就有七百五十张。表扬的人物有爱社如家的模范社员孙文芹、养猪模范高保万的母亲、劳动好的杨尤家村党支部书记孙玉兰。在这个充满社会主义气息的展览棚里，人们受到了极深刻的教育。许多参观的人说：“都这样爱社，社哪有办不好的呢？”
    展览会的第三部分，批评了有的社员自私自利、个人主义、劳动态度不好的事实。这里展出的是三方家村的农具，一部解放式水车，水车帽已不翼而飞，水车筒已五股分尸，齿轮和水车架子已长在一起。另外，还有一部七寸步犁，上面的锈和土有一寸厚。参观的人们当场就编了个快板：“有的社员太心偏，集体个人两样看，展览实物是面镜，都要回去照照脸。”
    展览会的第四部分是全乡二十五个村今年的跃进计划。实现这个计划后，这个乡将成为鱼米之乡了。
    第五部分是大字报专栏。这里是表决心、亮劲头、提建议、献计谋的地方。
    许多人看了展览会后，都表示：要在总路线的照耀下，更加劲地干活，促进生产跃进再跃进。
