Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation

	From "Grain Rain" (June 6th) to "Summer Solstice" (June 22nd), drought conditions persisted in areas north of the Yangtze River basin, the Huai River basin, most of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and Inner Mongolia. Due to the impact of the drought, these areas continued to rush to plant late autumn crops and transplant rice during this two-week period. Henan Province is advancing at a rate of 2 million mu of planting per day in a province-wide drought resistance and sowing campaign. Drought-resistant transplanting in many newly opened rice areas is also intense. In the Fuyang and Bengbu areas of Anhui Province, 5.7 million people are rushing to plant rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops every day to combat the drought.
	While combating drought, rushing to plant and transplant, these drought-stricken areas are also putting in enough effort to protect seedlings. "Don't bow to drought, keep irrigating the fields," and "Everyone is motivated, seedlings don't suffer from drought" have become the action slogans of the vast number of agricultural cooperative members in drought-stricken areas.
	Before the "Summer Solstice," early rice in the Yangtze River basin and other areas began to head, and a few started harvesting. Actively preparing for harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice is a central task for these provinces at present. Good early rice growth, large late rice area, and high requirements for the quality of agricultural work are common situations in southern rice areas. Many agricultural cooperatives have arranged labor and prepared tools according to this new situation this year, and have formulated specific plans for summer harvesting and planting in advance.
	Some regions with earlier seasons in Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces began to harvest early rice in mid-June, following Guangdong and Guangxi. Judging from the harvests in these areas that have already started harvesting, the unit yield of early rice this year is generally much higher than last year. According to estimates of harvests in early harvest areas, the Longxi area of ​​Fujian Province estimates that the average yield per mu of early rice in the entire area can exceed 500 jin.
	In northern regions, miscellaneous grain crops are generally growing well, and early-sown corn and sorghum are already more than half a person tall. Many areas are seizing the vigorous growing season of these crops to carry out field management such as cultivating, weeding, and topdressing. Combining summer hoeing with universal topdressing is a new phenomenon in the field management of miscellaneous grain crops this year. The improvement of tools has also blossomed and borne fruit in topdressing work. Many areas have created many topdressing carts, topdressing applicators, and the like in accordance with local conditions. Taking the Tieling area of ​​Liaoning Province as an example, no less than 30 kinds of topdressing tools were created in the early stage of summer hoeing. The relatively large-scale use of tools for topdressing is also a phenomenon rarely seen in previous years.
	Some early-planted potatoes in the North China Plain mature in mid-to-late June. Judging from a few harvests, the harvest of this crop this year is also better than in previous years.
	During this two-week period, most areas' cotton seedlings have five or six true leaves, and some cotton plants are gradually budding. Some cotton fields with good field management are budding about ten days earlier than last year. Due to the increased workload of summer harvesting and planting this year, some cotton-growing areas have postponed the thinning and setting of seedlings in cotton fields. The drought in cotton-growing areas such as Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces has not been resolved during this period. In order to strengthen cotton field management, many cotton-growing areas have paid attention to the overall arrangement of labor issues. After the Nantong cotton area of ​​Jiangsu Province rationally organized labor and arranged agricultural work, the progress of cotton field management turned faster. Before the "Summer Solstice," the entire area's 3.5 million mu of cotton fields were loosened and weeded more than twice, and topdressing was applied in conjunction with drought resistance.

### “芒种”（6月6日）——“夏至”（6月22日）

    “芒种”（6月6日）——“夏至”（6月22日）
    “芒种”到“夏至”间，长江流域以北、淮河流域、黄河中下游大部地区和内蒙古等地，旱象持续。由于干旱的影响，这些地区继续在这半个月里抢种晚秋作物和抢插水稻。河南在全省规模的抗旱播种运动中，每天以播种二百万亩的速度前进。许多新开稻区的抗旱插种也很紧张。安徽阜阳、蚌埠两个专区每天有五百七十万人抗旱抢种水稻、甘薯等。
    这些干旱地区在抗旱抢种、抢插的同时，还付出足够的力量进行抗旱保苗。“旱象不低头，灌田不停留”“人人鼓干劲，天旱苗不旱”，已成了抗旱地区广大农业社员的行动口号。
    “夏至”以前，长江流域等地的早稻部分开始抽穗，少数开镰收割。积极做好收获早稻，插栽晚稻的准备，是这些省份当前的一项中心工作。早稻生长好、晚稻面积大、农活质量要求高，是南方稻区的普遍情况。许多农业社都根据今年这一新的情况，安排了劳力并准备了工具，以及提前制订了夏收夏种的具体计划。
    福建、江西等省的一些季节较早的地区，继广东、广西以后，也在6月中旬开始收割早稻。从这些已开镰的地区看，今年早稻的单位产量普遍比去年高出很多。福建省龙溪专区根据早收地区收成的估计，全专区早稻平均亩产量可以超过五百斤。
    北方地区的杂粮作物一般生长良好，早播的玉米、高粱已有半人多高。不少地区都抓紧这些作物生长旺季进行中耕、除虫、追肥等田间管理。结合夏锄普遍追肥是今年杂粮作物田间管理的新气象。改良工具也在追肥工作中开花结果了。许多地区因地制宜地创造了许多追肥车、追肥器等。以辽宁省铁岭地区说，在夏锄初期就创制了不下三十种追肥工具。比较大范围的使用工具追肥，也是往年少有的现象。
    华北平原一些早种的马铃薯在6月中、下旬成熟。从少数收割的情况看，今年这项作物的收成也优于往年。
    在这半个月里，大部地区的棉苗已有五、六个真叶，部分棉株逐渐现蕾。一些田间管理好的棉田现蕾期比去年早十天左右。由于今年夏收夏种工作量的增加，有些棉区推迟了棉田的间苗、定苗的时间。山东、河南、河北等省棉区的干旱，在这个期间仍没有解除。许多棉区为了加强棉田管理，已经注意了全面安排劳力问题。江苏南通棉区合理组织劳力、安排农活以后，棉田管理进展转快。“夏至”以前全区三百五十万亩棉田松土、锄草二次以上，并结合抗旱追了肥。
