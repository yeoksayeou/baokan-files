    Semi-Monthly International Review
    From June 5th to 19th
    Due to the continued strengthening of the national independence struggles of the people in the Middle East and North Africa, and the continued deterioration of the economic situation in the capitalist world, the difficulties faced by imperialist countries are increasing. The US and British imperialist forces are actively plotting armed intervention in the situation in Lebanon, and the newly-appointed French De Gaulle government is also trying its best to strengthen the armed suppression of the Algerian people. They are attempting to get rid of their difficulties with a frantic policy of military adventure. This arrogant ambition of the imperialist countries has been resolutely opposed by the people of the Middle East and North Africa. The Lebanese and Algerian people are responding to the imperialist policies of armed intervention and armed suppression by strengthening their armed struggle.
    In order to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis, British Prime Minister Macmillan put forward the idea of "economic interdependence" in his talks with US President Eisenhower, but was met with a cold reception from the United States. It can be seen that the fierce economic struggle between imperialist countries cannot be eased.
    Socialist countries continue to work to promote the relaxation of international tensions. On the 11th of this month, Soviet Premier Khrushchev once again wrote to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France, asking them to state their attitude towards holding a summit meeting. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published on the 17th of this month the Soviet government's proposal of May 5th this year regarding the issues to be discussed at the summit meeting. Khrushchev's letter and the Soviet government's proposal will enable peace-loving people of all countries to better understand how stubbornly the imperialist countries headed by the United States are obstructing the convening of the summit meeting and attempting to bury it.
    Stop the US from Playing with Fire in Lebanon
    The Lebanese people's armed struggle against the pro-imperialist policies pursued by the Chamoun ruling clique has entered its sixth week. The people's armed forces are highly motivated and are getting stronger as they fight. The Chamoun ruling clique is completely isolated politically and has reached a point where it cannot control the situation militarily.
    At present, the insurgent people's armed forces have already controlled most of Lebanon. The number of insurgent people's armed forces has reached 10,000. Since the beginning of June, the Chamoun authorities' troops have launched many attacks on areas controlled by the insurgent people's armed forces. However, the insurgent people have repeatedly and victoriously repelled the government troops. On June 14th and 15th, the insurgent people in the Beirut city area launched a fierce attack on the government troops. Strongholds such as the presidential palace, the residence of Prime Minister Solh, and the Ministry of Defense were all attacked. At the same time, the people's armed forces in the central Shouf Mountains also launched attacks on several strongholds 35 kilometers east of Beirut, capturing a large number of weapons manufactured by the United States, Britain, and other countries. This offensive vividly demonstrated the great power of the people's armed forces.
    The crumbling Chamoun group has pinned all its hopes on further intervention activities by the US and British imperialism.
    The US and British intervention activities in Lebanon first involve using the armed forces of their puppet states to lead the way. Three battalions of Jordanian troops, three battalions of Iraqi troops, and some Iraqi aircraft have entered Lebanon under the instructions of the US and Britain to join the Chamoun forces. Major General Izzat Hassan, commander of the Fifth Division of the Jordanian Army, has arrived in Beirut to take command. In addition, many Turkish officers and soldiers also secretly arrived in Beirut in early June.
    However, the troops of these puppet states have not been able to intimidate the Lebanese people, and the strength of the insurgent people continues to grow. Therefore, the United States and Britain are actively preparing to personally step in and openly send troops to land in Lebanon. According to the British "News Chronicle" on June 13th, the United States and Britain have already formulated a plan for armed intervention. According to this plan, the US Sixth Fleet will transport 3,000 Marines to land in Beirut; US and British paratroopers will occupy southern Lebanon. This plan has been finalized in the talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan. At present, the United States and Britain are carrying out extensive activities to realize this extremely arrogant intervention plan. The US authorities have issued new orders to the ships of the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, ordering them to wait for emergency action in order to "maximize assistance to Lebanon." A large number of British paratrooper units and artillery units are also gathering in Cyprus. On June 17th, US Secretary of State Dulles even openly clamored that "under certain conditions, the United States will use military action" to intervene in the Lebanese situation. Recently, the French authorities have also expressed their intention to participate in the US and British armed intervention plan.
    These intervention activities and clamoring by the United States are being carried out under the guise of the United Nations. According to the Security Council's resolution of June 11th, an observer committee has been sent to Lebanon. The dispatch of this observer committee is essentially to "legitimize" the imperialist intervention activities. However, even so, Dulles felt that it could not meet the needs of US intervention. He further proposed the establishment of a so-called "United Nations Security Force" in Lebanon. The purpose of Dulles' proposal is to send US and British armed forces into Lebanon under the name of the "United Nations Security Force" to realize his armed intervention plan.
    Dark clouds are looming over the eastern Mediterranean. Due to the armed intervention activities of the US and Britain and their puppets in Lebanon, peace in the Middle East and the independence of the Arab nations are being severely threatened. However, the Lebanese people and the people of the Middle Eastern countries are strong and unyielding. The major opposition parties in Lebanon have repeatedly expressed their solemn position of firmly opposing the intervention of the US and Britain. The US and Britain playing with fire in Lebanon is also a serious threat to world peace. All peace-loving forces in the world are closely watching the situation there.
    The Struggle of the French People
    The political situation in France is still in turmoil. The struggle between the people's forces and the fascist forces is being carried out fiercely.
    After De Gaulle came to power, he forced the National Assembly to adjourn and obtained broad personal powers, and is stepping up preparations to "amend the constitution" in an attempt to further free future governments from the supervision of voters. At the same time, the fascist forces have been given the opportunity to openly engage in activities, and their arrogance is increasing day by day. In Algeria, the "Committee of Public Safety" has been recognized by the De Gaulle government as a legal organization, and rebel generals Salan and Massu have even obtained greater powers than in the past. In mainland France, various fascist organizations, including the "Movement for the Fifth Republic" launched by Chaban-Delmas, chairman of the Social Republican Party (former De Gaulle faction), the "People's Movement" promoted by Air Force General Chassin, and the "National Christian Democratic Movement" advocated by the right-wing leader of the Popular Republican Party, Bidault, are multiplying like poisonous bacteria in some dark corners.
    The threat to the freedom and democratic rights of the French people is extremely serious. However, as Maurice Thorez, secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, said, "The social and political forces in France are capable of blocking the road of fascism and defeating personal dictatorship."
    The French Communist Party has further increased its prestige among the masses because it has demonstrated in the struggle that it is a firm defender of the interests of the French people and the nation. The work of raising funds for the anti-fascist struggle initiated by the French Communist Party has achieved great success, and various anti-fascist struggle rallies organized by the French Communist Party have also received widespread support. On June 9th and 10th, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary meeting, calling on all democratic and national forces in France to unite around the working class and take forceful actions to defend peace, democracy, and freedom. This call greatly promoted the struggle of the French people.
    In addition to the domestic struggle, the contradictions between the French colonialists and the North African people have also intensified. De Gaulle openly declared that he wanted to annex Algeria, making Algeria a French territory forever, and making the Algerian people "thorough" Frenchmen. This blatant colonialist policy has been solemnly condemned by the Algerian National Liberation Front. The Algerian people are fighting more resolutely for their independence. According to the headquarters of the French colonial army, in the week from June 9th to 15th alone, no less than 150 battles of various sizes took place on the Algerian battlefield. In addition, Tunisia and Morocco have also expressed strong opposition to De Gaulle's Algerian policy.
    Continuing the Algerian war makes it impossible for France to escape its financial difficulties. In recent months, France's foreign trade deficit has continued to increase, and the foreign debt borrowed at the beginning of this year is about to run out. Therefore, the De Gaulle government decided to issue a new public debt with a term of up to 54 years to make up for the empty treasury, and is preparing to "freeze wages" to intensify the exploitation of the working people. However, in any case, the Algerian people cannot be defeated. The De Gaulle government's attempt to scrape together money domestically to continue the colonial war will obviously only deepen France's financial crisis and be met with stronger opposition from the French people.
    Fruitless Talks
    From June 9th to 11th, US President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan held three days of talks in Washington. No communique was issued after the end of the talks. News from Western news agencies indicated that the United States and Britain did not reach any agreement in this meeting.
    Economic issues were the main agenda of this US-British meeting. This is because the economic crisis in the United States is deepening and its impact on other capitalist countries is increasing, so how to resist the impact of the crisis has become a problem that the United States and Britain urgently hope to solve.
    In the meeting, Macmillan promoted his theory of "economic interdependence" to his American "allies" with "unexpected vigor." The so-called "economic interdependence" means promoting investment and international trade through "dollar-pound cooperation." It is revealed that the specific method is: the United States provides money to expand the International Monetary Fund, turning this institution into a super central bank, so that Britain can obtain a part of the funds it needs from there; the United States provides Britain with a "standby loan" as Britain's reserve to stabilize and strengthen the position of the pound; and increase the dollar price of gold, thereby increasing the value of the pound.
    It is not difficult to see that although the British Prime Minister repeatedly said that his theory can bring benefits to the entire "free world," in fact, he is completely for the economic interests of Britain. The economic crisis in the capitalist world that started in the United States has made the British economic situation increasingly difficult. The surge in unemployment, the decline in production in many important industrial sectors, and the large number of idle transport ships... these are the signs that have already appeared. And what worries Britain even more is the issue of international trade and pound reserves. Due to the sharp drop in raw material prices in the international market, the United States has greatly reduced the import of raw materials, and the income of many Commonwealth countries and British colonies that mainly rely on exporting raw materials to the United States has declined. These countries and regions will inevitably reduce imports to cope with the difficulties in international payments, which will have a huge impact on Britain's foreign trade. Not only that, these countries and regions have "sterling balances" in London that are several times the size of Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves. If they withdraw this amount of money from Britain in the future, it will shake the position of the pound and make it difficult to maintain the sterling area. Britain is preparing to hold a federal economic conference this autumn, and the purpose is to prevent this situation from happening. Macmillan was eager to meet with Eisenhower this time, also hoping to get some benefits from the United States as Britain's capital at the federal economic conference.
    The United States is thinking completely differently. Dulles also publicly clamored to take "new initiatives" in the economic field. However, this is definitely not for the benefit of Britain. It is revealed that the United States advocates that the United States and West Germany establish a fund organization to invest in "undeveloped" countries, and Britain and the Commonwealth countries can participate in this organization. In this way, the United States can export its own economic crisis and take the opportunity to infiltrate the sterling area.
    It was under these circumstances that the result of the meeting was that the United States was lukewarm about Britain's plan, while Britain was suspicious of the US proposal, and therefore could not make any specific decisions on economic issues.
    Eisenhower and Macmillan also discussed summit meetings, disarmament issues, cessation of nuclear testing, and the French situation at the meeting. On the issue of nuclear weapons, the two sides had a quarrel. Eisenhower promised to open the "scientific iron curtain" and share atomic weapons secrets with Britain during the last US-British meeting. This promise has not been fulfilled until now, but this time the United States accused Britain of not providing it with information on atomic power plant equipment. This haggling did not yield any results in the meeting.
    In the new situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, the contradictions between the United States and Britain are becoming more acute. The fruitless ending of this US-British meeting fully shows that it is becoming more and more difficult to conceal and ease this contradiction.

    半月国际述评
    从6月5日到19日
    由于中东和北非人民争取民族独立斗争的继续加强，由于资本主义世界的经济情况的继续恶化，帝国主义国家所面临的困难正在与日俱增。美英帝国主义势力正积极策划武装干涉黎巴嫩的局势，刚上台的法国戴高乐政府也竭力加强对阿尔及利亚人民的武装镇压，它们企图以疯狂的军事冒险政策来摆脱它们的困难。帝国主义国家的这种狂妄野心，遭到了中东和北非人民的坚决反对。黎巴嫩人民和阿尔及利亚人民以加强武装斗争来回答帝国主义的武装干涉和武装镇压政策。
    为了减缓经济危机的冲击，英国首相麦克米伦在与美国总统艾森豪威尔的会谈中提出了“经济上互相依赖”的主张，但是遭到了美国的冷淡的待遇。可见帝国主义国家之间在经济方面的剧烈搏斗，是无法缓和的。
    社会主义国家继续为促进缓和国际紧张局势而努力。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在本月11日再一次写信给美、英、法政府首脑，要他们表明对召开最高级会议的态度。苏联“真理报”于本月17日发表了苏联政府在今年5月5日提出的关于最高级会议讨论的问题的建议。赫鲁晓夫的信件和苏联政府的建议，将使各国爱好和平人民更加认清以美国为首的帝国主义国家是如何顽固地在阻挠最高级会议的召开，并企图把它埋葬掉。
    制止美国在黎巴嫩玩火
    黎巴嫩人民为反对夏蒙统治集团所执行的亲帝国主义政策而进行的武装斗争已经进入第六个星期。人民武装斗志旺盛，越打越强。夏蒙统治集团政治上完全陷于孤立，军事上已到了无法控制局势的地步。
    现在，起义人民武装已经控制了黎巴嫩的大部分地区。起义人民武装的人数已达一万人。6月初以来，夏蒙当局的军队曾多次向起义人民武装所控制的地区发动进攻。但是，起义人民每次都胜利地击退了政府军队。6月14、15两天，贝鲁特市区的起义人民更向政府军队展开了猛烈的进攻。总统府、总理索勒哈的住宅以及国防部等据点，都遭到攻击。同时，中部舒弗山区的人民武装也对贝鲁特以东三十五公里的几个据点展开攻击，缴获了大批美、英等国制造的武器。这次攻势，生动地显示了人民武装的浩大声势。
    摇摇欲坠的夏蒙集团已把他们的全部希望都寄托在美、英帝国主义进一步的干涉活动上。
    美英两国干涉黎巴嫩的活动，首先是利用它们的仆从国家的武装部队来打先锋。三营约旦军队，三营伊拉克军队和一部分伊拉克飞机，已经在美、英授意下进入黎巴嫩，参加夏蒙部队。约旦陆军第五师师长伊扎特·哈桑少将已到达贝鲁特，担任指挥。另外，很多土耳其官兵，也在6月上旬秘密到达贝鲁特。
    但是，这些仆从国家的军队并未能吓倒黎巴嫩人民，起义人民的力量仍然继续壮大起来。因此，美、英两国积极准备亲自出马，公开派兵在黎巴嫩登陆。据6月13日英国“新闻纪事报”透露，美、英两国已经拟订了一个武装干涉计划。根据这个计划，美国第六舰队将运送三千名海军陆战队在贝鲁特登陆；美、英两国伞兵将占领黎巴嫩南部。在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦会谈中，这个计划已得到最后肯定。目前，美、英两国正在大肆活动，准备实现这个狂妄透顶的干涉计划。美国当局已经向地中海东部的第六舰队舰只发出新的命令，要它们等待采取紧急行动，以便“最大限度地帮助黎巴嫩”。英国大批伞兵部队、炮兵部队也在塞浦路斯集结。6月17日，美国国务卿杜勒斯更公开叫嚣说，“在某种条件下，美国将用军事行动”来干涉黎巴嫩局势。最近，法国当局也表示有意参加美、英的武装干涉计划。
    美国的这些干涉活动和叫嚣，是打着联合国的幌子来进行的。根据安全理事会6月11日的决议，一个观察委员会已经派往黎巴嫩，这个观察委员会的派遣实质上是为了使帝国主义的干涉活动“合法”化。然而，即使这样，杜勒斯还觉得不能适应美国的干涉的需要。他又进一步提出了在黎巴嫩建立一支所谓“联合国保安部队”的主张。杜勒斯这个主张的目的，就是要在“联合国保安部队”的名义下，把美、英武装部队开入黎巴嫩，来实现他的武装干涉计划。
    阴云笼罩在东地中海的上空。由于美英两国及其仆从对黎巴嫩的武装干涉活动，中东的和平和阿拉伯民族独立正遭到严重威胁。但是，黎巴嫩人民和中东各国人民是坚强不屈的。黎巴嫩各个主要反对党派已经一再表示了坚决反对美英两国干涉的严正立场。美英两国在黎巴嫩玩弄战火，也是对世界和平的一个严重威胁。全世界爱好和平的力量正在密切注意着那里的局势。
    法国人民的斗争
    法国的政局仍然处在动荡中。人民力量和法西斯势力之间的斗争正在激烈地进行着。
    戴高乐上台后，已经迫使国民议会休会而取得了广泛的个人权力，并且正在加紧准备“修改宪法”，企图使今后的政府能够进一步摆脱选民的监督。同时，法西斯势力得到公开活动的机会，气焰日益嚣张。在阿尔及利亚，“救国委员会”已经被戴高乐政府承认为合法的组织，叛乱将领萨兰和马絮等甚至得到了比过去更大的权力。在法国本土，各式各样的法西斯组织，其中包括社会共和党（前戴高乐派）主席沙邦—戴尔马发动的“争取第五共和国运动”、空军将领夏申推行的“人民运动”和人民共和党的右翼领袖皮杜尔倡导的“全国基督教民主运动”正像毒菌一样地在一些阴暗的角落里繁殖着。
    法国人民的自由和民主权利面临的威胁是极其严重的。但是，正如法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛所说的，“法国的社会力量和政治力量是能够堵塞法西斯的道路和击败个人独裁的”。
    法国共产党由于在斗争中表现出它是法国人民和民族利益的坚定的捍卫者，因而在群众中的威望进一步提高了。法国共产党发起的筹集反法西斯斗争基金的工作获得巨大的成就，由法国共产党组织的各种反法西斯斗争的集会也得到了广泛的支持。6月9日和10日，法国共产党中央委员会举行了全体会议，号召法国所有民主力量和民族力量联合在工人阶级周围，用有力的行动来维护和平、民主和自由。这个号召，大大地推动了法国人民的斗争。
    除了国内的斗争以外，法国殖民主义者和北非人民之间的矛盾也加剧了。戴高乐公然宣称他要吞并阿尔及利亚，使阿尔及利亚永远成为法国的领土，使阿尔及利亚人民成为“十足的”法国人。这种露骨的殖民主义政策受到了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线严正的谴责。阿尔及利亚人民正用更坚决的战斗来争取自己的独立。据法国殖民军总部透露，仅仅从6月9日到15日的一周内，在阿尔及利亚战场上就发生了大小战斗不下一百五十次。此外，突尼斯和摩洛哥两国对戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策也表示了强烈的反对。
    继续阿尔及利亚战争，使得法国无法摆脱财政困难的窘境。这几个月来，法国对外贸易的逆差不断增加，今年年初借来的外债眼看就要用完。因此，戴高乐政府决定发行一项为期长达五十四年的新公债来弥补空虚的国库，并且准备“冻结工资”来加紧压榨劳动人民。但是，无论如何，阿尔及利亚人民是不能战胜的。戴高乐政府在国内罗掘财源企图把殖民战争打下去，显然只能使法国的财政危机进一步加深，并且受到法国人民更加强烈的反对。
    无结果的会谈
    从6月9日到11日，美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦在华盛顿举行了三天的会谈。这次会谈结束后没有发表任何公报。西方通讯社的消息表明，美英两国在这次会谈中没有达成什么协议。
    经济问题是这次美英会谈的主要议程。这是因为，美国的经济危机日益加深，并且对其它资本主义国家的影响越来越大，因而怎样抵挡危机的冲击就成为美英两国急切希望解决的问题了。
    麦克米伦在会谈中以“意料之外的劲头”向美国“盟友”宣传他所提出的“经济上互相依赖”的理论。所谓“经济上互相依赖”，内容是通过“美元—英镑合作”，促进投资和国际贸易。据透露，其具体办法是：由美国出钱来扩大国际货币基金组织，把这个机构变成一个超级中央银行，使得英国可以从那里得到一部分它所需要的资金；由美国向英国提供一笔
  “备用贷款”，作为英国的储备，以稳定和加强英镑的地位；提高黄金的美元价格，从而提高英镑的价值。
    不难看出，尽管英国首相口口声声说他的理论可以给整个“自由世界”带来好处，实际上他为的完全是英国的经济利益。从美国开始的资本主义世界的经济危机使英国经济处境越来越困难了。失业人数激增，很多重要工业部门生产下降，运输船只大量闲置……这些是已经出现的迹象。而更令英国不安的是国际贸易和英镑储备的问题。由于国际市场上原料价格猛跌，美国大量减少原料的进口，主要依靠向美国输出原料的很多英联邦国家和英国殖民地收入下降了。这些国家和地区势必要缩减进口来应付国际收支的困难，这将使英国的对外贸易受到巨大的打击。不仅如此，这些国家和地区在伦敦有着为数几倍于英国黄金外汇储备的“英镑结存”，如果今后向英国提取这笔款项，就会使英镑地位发生动摇，使英镑区难于维持。英国准备在今年秋季召开联邦经济会议，目的就在于防止这种局面的出现。麦克米伦这次急于和艾森豪威尔会谈，也是希望从美国那里得到一些好处，作为英国在联邦经济会议上的资本。
    美国想的完全是另外一套。杜勒斯也公开叫嚷要在经济方面采取“新的主动”。不过，这决不是为了英国的利益。据透露，美国主张由美国和西德搞个基金组织来对“不发达”国家进行投资，英国和英联邦国家可以参加这个组织。这样，美国就可以输出自己的经济危机，并且可以乘机把势力渗入英镑区。
    正是在这种情况下，会谈的结果是，美国对英国的计划表示冷淡，而英国对美国的主张表示疑惧，在经济问题上因而也就不能作出任何具体决定。
    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在会谈中还讨论了最高级会议问题、裁军问题、停止核试验问题和法国局势等。在核武器问题上，双方进行了一场争吵。艾森豪威尔在上次美英会谈时曾答应要打开“科学铁幕”，同英国共享原子武器秘密。这个诺言一直到现在还没有兑现，可是这一次美国却指责英国不向它提供关于原子发电站装备的情报。这种讨价还价，在会谈中也没有得到结果。
    在东风继续压倒西风的新形势下，美国和英国之间的矛盾是更加尖锐了。这次美英会谈的无结果而散，充分表明要掩饰和缓和这种矛盾是越来越困难了。
