Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: News from Washington and London indicates that the US and British governments are preparing to take military action to directly intervene in Lebanon. The two governments have drafted detailed military plans to help the Lebanese government of Chamoun deal with the rebellious people.

US President Eisenhower held meetings with Secretary of State Dulles and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining on the evenings of the 15th and 16th, respectively, to discuss the situation in Lebanon. According to Agence France-Presse, quoting well-informed diplomatic sources, the US plan is to take action, sending troops to land in Lebanon, if the Lebanese government requests it or if the government is overthrown.

Under the pretext of "rotation," the US Navy Department announced on the 16th that a battalion of US Marines with 1,700 soldiers would be transferred from the United States to the Mediterranean on the 25th. It is reported that units of the US Sixth Fleet have received new orders to await emergency action. In addition, there are reports that US paratroopers stationed in West Germany can also be transferred to Lebanon "if necessary."

According to sources close to the British government, Britain, like the United States, is determined to take military action in Lebanon "when necessary."

British Prime Minister Macmillan held lengthy talks on the morning of the 16th with Foreign Secretary Lloyd, Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Heathcoat Amory regarding the situation in Lebanon. US Ambassador to London John Whitney also attended the meeting, exceeding protocol. At the same time, two thousand British paratroopers began to be transported to Cyprus on the 16th, and another thousand paratroopers arrived in Cyprus last weekend, ready to move out at any time.

According to various reports, in order to put a fig leaf on the naked act of interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs, the US and Britain intend to carry out this intervention under the banner of the United Nations as much as possible. In this regard, the first attempt is to use the UN Observer Group sent to Lebanon to interfere in the Lebanese situation.

According to an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 16th, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld told an Italian envoy stationed in New York that "the United Nations" might send troops to Lebanon as an "international police force" to intervene in the Lebanese situation. Prior to this, US Secretary of State Dulles had said that sending UN troops to Lebanon was "more appropriate."

    美英想打着联合国招牌对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉
    据新华社17日讯　从华盛顿和伦敦传出的消息说，美英两国政府准备采取军事行动来直接干涉黎巴嫩。两国政府已经拟订了帮助黎巴嫩夏蒙政府来对付起义人民的详细军事计划。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔15日晚上和16日分别同国务卿杜勒斯和参谋长联席会议主席特文宁举行会议，讨论黎巴嫩局势。据法新社引用消息灵通的外交人士的话说，美国的打算是，如果黎巴嫩政府提出请求或者这个政府被推翻，美国就要采取行动，派兵在黎巴嫩登陆。
    美国海军部16日在“轮换”的借口下宣布，拥有一千七百名士兵的一营美国海军陆战队将在25日由美国调往地中海。据报道，美国第六舰队各单位已经得到新的命令，要他们等待采取紧急行动。另外还有消息说，“如果需要”，美国驻在西德的伞兵也可以调到黎巴嫩。
    据接近英国政府的人士说，英国也和美国一样决心“必要时”在黎巴嫩采取军事行动。
    英国首相麦克米伦16日上午已就黎巴嫩局势同外交大臣劳埃德、殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德和财政大臣希思寇特—埃默里进行了长时间的会谈。美国驻伦敦大使约翰·惠特尼也超越常规出席了这次会议。同时，英国的两千名伞兵已在16日开始运往塞浦路斯，另外一千名伞兵已在上周周末抵达塞浦路斯，准备随时出动。
    据各方面的报道，为了给赤裸裸的干涉黎巴嫩内政的行为挂上一块遮羞布，美英两国打算尽量在联合国的招牌下来进行这种干涉。在这方面，首先是企图利用派往黎巴嫩的联合国观察委员会来干涉黎巴嫩局势。
    据意大利外交部发言人16日说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德向意大利驻在纽约的一位使节表示，“联合国”可能派军队到黎巴嫩去，作为“国际警察部队”来干涉黎巴嫩局势。在这以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经说，派联合国部队到黎巴嫩去是“比较适宜”的。
