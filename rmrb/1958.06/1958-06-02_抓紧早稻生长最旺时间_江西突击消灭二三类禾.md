　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the growth of early rice and field management throughout the province, demanding that all localities seize the opportunity, work hard for ten days, to make first-class seedlings grow better, transform second-class seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice this year.

　　In Jiangxi Province, shortly after the transplanting of early rice this year, most areas of the province encountered continuous rainstorms. The people rose up to fight the floods, and only recently overcame the floods and restored production. However, according to inspections and analysis in various localities, the first-class seedlings, which are growing relatively well, currently account for only 30% of the total; the second-class seedlings, which are not growing well enough but are in their flourishing period and have not yet closed ranks, account for 55%; and the third-class seedlings, which are growing very poorly, have only just begun to tiller, and the seedlings are yellow and thin, account for 15%.

　　Therefore, the Provincial Committee believes that in order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of early rice, it is necessary to take emergency measures to strengthen field management. Most early rice crops are still about ten days away from jointing and stem elongation. This period is when early rice needs the most fertilizer and grows the most vigorously. Therefore, seizing the opportunity of these ten days to make a concentrated effort to weed and topdress, continue to strengthen first-class seedlings, and eliminate second and third-class seedlings is still an extremely effective measure. The Provincial Committee has put forward the following requirements for this purpose: 1. For first-class seedlings, fertilizer should be replenished where it is lacking, and those with sufficient fertilizer should be drained and the fields dried in time to prevent excessive growth and lodging in the later stages. 2. For second-class seedlings, apply a quick-acting fertilizer immediately, and cultivate once to promote the development of stems and leaves. 3. For third-class seedlings, strive to apply quick-acting fertilizer twice more; cultivate once or twice more to promote faster tillering of the seedlings.

### 抓紧早稻生长最旺时间  江西突击消灭二三类禾

　　抓紧早稻生长最旺时间  江西突击消灭二三类禾
    本报讯　中共江西省委最近检查了全省早稻的生长情况和田间管理工作，要求各地抓紧时机，苦战十天，使一类禾长得更好、改变二类禾、消灭三类禾，力争今年早稻实现全面大丰收。
    江西省今年早稻插秧后不久，全省大部分地区便连续碰到暴雨，人民奋起与洪水搏斗，最近才战胜水灾恢复了生产，但据各地检查分析，目前全省属于生长较好的一类禾苗只占30％；生长不够好，但正在盛发期尚未封行的二类禾苗占55％；生长很差，才开始发蔸，秧苗黄瘦的三类禾占15％。
    因此，省委认为，为了争取早稻全面丰收，必须采取紧急措施加强田间管理。目前大多数早稻距离拔节、圆秆还有十天左右的时间。这段时间是早稻最需肥料、生长最旺的时候，因此，抓紧这十天的时机突击耘禾、追肥，继续加强一类禾苗，消灭二类和三类禾苗，还是极其有效的措施。省委对此分别提出了如下要求：一、对一类禾，要缺肥补肥，施肥足的要及时进行排水晒田，以防止后期疯长倒伏。二、对二类禾，要立即追施一次速效肥料，中耘一次，促使茎叶发育。三、对三类禾，要力争再追施两次速效肥料；再耘一次到两次，促使禾苗更快的发兜。
