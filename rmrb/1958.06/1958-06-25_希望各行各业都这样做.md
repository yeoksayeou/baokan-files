    Hope All Trades and Professions Do This
    On June 10th, the People's Daily published on page seven a piece titled "Historical Proof," which was a material provided by the First Ministry of Machine Building on forty-one major inventors in the history of mechanical and electrical technology over the past two hundred years. This material eloquently demonstrated that the inventions and creations of science and technology mostly originate from the working people and mostly come from those with low social status, little education, and poor conditions. After reading it, we have further enhanced our confidence and courage in technological innovation. We hope that all trades and professions can provide such materials.

    希望各行各业都这样做
    6月10日人民日报七版以“历史的证明”为题，发表了第一机械工业部提供的两百多年来机械电气技术史上四十一个主要发明家的材料。这个材料雄辩地说明了科学技术的发明创造，大都是从劳动人民中产生出来的，大都出于那些社会地位低、学问少、条件差的人们。我们读了以后，更加提高了革新技术的信心和勇气。希望各行各业都能提供这样的材料。
