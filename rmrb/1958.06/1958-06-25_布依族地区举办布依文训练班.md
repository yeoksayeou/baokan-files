The Guizhou Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is holding Buyi language training classes and piloting the promotion of the Buyi language in the Buyi area. At present, Buyi language training classes held in eleven counties including Ceheng, Wangmo, Huishui, and Luodian have successively started, with a total of more than 2,300 students. Among these students, in addition to 150 ethnic minority cadres and primary school teachers, the rest are young and middle-aged activists recommended by agricultural cooperatives who have a Chinese language level of elementary school or above and are familiar with the Buyi language. After three months of study, they will return to the countryside to serve as Buyi language literacy teachers and carry out literacy work. In addition, more than 40 Buyi language promotion pilot sites set up in Buyi rural areas have recently seen twelve pilot sites begin classes, with participants being young and middle-aged farmers, totaling about 2,000 people.
The Qiannan Prefecture Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to "complete ethnic minority language literacy in three years and realize a school network." This year, it will organize 100,000 young and middle-aged farmers in the Buyi-populated areas to learn the Buyi language. These Buyi language training classes and pilot sites have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Buyi people. The Buyi language pilot sites in Boqiu Village in the First District of Luodian County and Guyang Village in Changshun County originally planned to enroll only 50 students at each site, but more than 200 Buyi farmers applied for enrollment at each site.

    布依族地区举办布依文训练班
    本报讯　贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州在布依族地区举办布依文训练班和推广布依文试点。目前，册亨、望谟、惠水、罗甸等十一个县举办的布依文的训练班，已相继开学，共有学员二千三百多人。这些学员中，除一百五十人是在职民族干部和小学教师外，其余都是农业社保送的具有初小以上汉文水平、熟悉布依族语言的青壮年积极分子。他们经过三个月学习后，即回农村担任布依文扫盲教师，开展扫盲工作。此外，分设在布依族农村的四十多个布依文推广试点，最近已有十二个试点开始上课，参加学习的都是青壮年农民，共约两千人。
    中共黔南州委会决定“三年完成民族文字扫盲，实现学校网”，今年将要在布依族聚居区内组织十万青壮年农民学习布依文。这些布依文训练班和试点受到了广大布依族人民的热烈欢迎。罗甸县一区波球寨和长顺县古羊寨的布依文试点，原计划每个点只收五十个学员，但报名要求入学的布依族农民都在二百人以上。
