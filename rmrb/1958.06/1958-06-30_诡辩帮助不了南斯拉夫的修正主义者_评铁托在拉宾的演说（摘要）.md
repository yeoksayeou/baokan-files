Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 26th. The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial on the 23rd titled "Sophistry Cannot Help Yugoslav Revisionists – A Critique of Tito's Speech in Labin".

The article stated that Tito's speech in Labin, in terms of its content, primarily aimed to once again defend the revisionist essence of the Yugoslav League of Communists' program, while reproaching and slandering communist and workers' parties, as well as the socialist camp. Tito essentially did not answer the Marxist-Leninist criticisms of the Yugoslav League of Communists' program, but instead engaged in cynical mockery of the Soviet Union and its leadership, as well as communist and workers' parties of various countries. Just as in the program itself, the speech made no mention of American imperialists. Tito, however, viciously attacked the Chinese Communist Party and its leaders, the Bulgarian Communist Party and its Seventh Congress, and the Albanian Party of Labor. It is no exaggeration to say that, through Tito's speech, the Yugoslav leaders finally dropped the mask of revisionists and agitators, resorting to any means to defend their anti-Marxist stance.

Tito completely distorted the substance and nature of the criticism of Yugoslav revisionism, in total violation of the facts. He sophistically and with ulterior motives described this criticism as an "attack on socialist Yugoslavia" and a "slander of the Yugoslav people." In Tito's view, the main reason for this "campaign" was that the Yugoslav League of Communists did not sign the Moscow Declaration of the Twelve Countries and that Yugoslavia refused to participate in the "so-called (!) socialist camp."

The article stated that to forcibly equate the criticism of the Yugoslav League of Communists' revisionist program with an attack on Yugoslavia is a gross distortion of the truth. It is very clear that this criticism stems from deep-seated principled considerations, to defend Marxist-Leninist theory from opportunistic and petty-bourgeois distortions. This criticism strives to show the world the true face of modern revisionism and to point out the danger it poses to the international communist movement and workers' movement, and to the unity of the world's socialist forces. Everyone is well aware that communist and workers' parties have always respected the people of all countries, including the Yugoslav people.

The article pointed out that Yugoslavia's line has been warmly welcomed and fully endorsed in the imperialist camp, which openly encourages the Yugoslav leaders to take "the road of their own choosing." Historical facts show that what benefits imperialism must necessarily harm socialism, the working class, and the working people. Who does not know that after the Ljubljana Congress, influential figures in Washington and New York immediately and impatiently said that "aid to Yugoslavia must be allocated quickly in the long-term interests of the United States." What these long-term interests are is easy to understand. If the Yugoslav leadership still considers itself part of the world communist movement, then it might be reminded of an old saying: "If the enemy praises you, you have to think about what stupid thing you have done!"

The article continued, saying that the General Secretary of the Yugoslav League of Communists made crude and immoral attacks on the Chinese Communist Party, its leaders and newspapers in his speech. The "People's Daily" articles and the Chinese leaders' remarks on Yugoslav revisionism were described as "cruel attacks on socialist Yugoslavia."

The article stated that communist parties and working people all over the world know very well that the international communist movement and workers' movement have the greatest respect and reverence for the Chinese Communist Party and its great party, because this party has made a tremendous contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has carried out bloody struggles against Chinese feudalism, capitalism, and foreign imperialism, and has led the Chinese people to victory. Now this party is organizing and leading socialist construction of immense scale and unprecedented speed. The Chinese Communist Party creatively applies the principles of Marxism-Leninism to China's specific environment, using unprecedented new forms to achieve socialist victory. But the Chinese comrades never say that they have come up with their own Chinese road to socialism, but always emphasize that they are advancing along the road pointed out by the great October Socialist Revolution, the road tested in the Soviet Union, and that they are using the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Union's experience of world-historical significance.

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese leaders have a very high prestige in the world. No matter how desperately the modern impostors of Marxism try to tarnish the prestige of the CPC and the Chinese leaders, they will not succeed, whether in terms of development or strength.

The article pointed out that Tito did not stop there. He went even further, shockingly accusing the Chinese leaders of being...new warmongers. There is no need to comment here, such arguments can only be concocted in the kitchen of imperialist propaganda. The result is a very strange spectacle: peace-loving and democratic China is accused of instigating war, while not a single word of condemnation is uttered against the real warmongers—the American imperialists. Moreover, it is necessary to mention a fact here. Not long ago, Yugoslav newspapers and Yugoslav leaders hinted that the Chinese Communist Party seemed to approve of Yugoslavia's independent policy, that the Chinese Communist Party did not agree with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' criticism of the "Yugoslav position," and that China was on Yugoslavia's side. The purpose of this malicious instigation was to sow discord with China. As everyone knows, this attempt ran into a brick wall.

Now, the Yugoslav newspapers and Yugoslav leaders have made a 180-degree turn. They are trying hard to explain that the Chinese leaders criticized the Ljubljana program in a "special way," and that communist parties of other countries "disagree" with such criticism. Naturally, this is a diversionary tactic, which has nothing in common with the actual situation. Khrushchev gave the best possible answer to this point at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

One of the aims of Tito's Labin speech was to belittle the significance of the recently held Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and to reject the Central Committee's summary report, which was full of Marxist-Leninist principles, the delegates' speeches, and the just criticisms made in Comrade Khrushchev's brilliant speech at the Congress. In this regard, as in the attitude towards Chinese comrades, anything was said in order to achieve his goals.

It is very clear that neither the Bulgarian leaders nor the Bulgarian newspapers have engaged in bullying and insults; everyone knows that bullying and insults are the patent of someone else. The Bulgarian Communist Party and its activists consider it their sacred duty to oppose any distortion of Marxism-Leninism and to defend the purity of its banner, the banner of proletarian internationalism. The entire process of our historically significant Seventh Congress has embodied the spirit of infinite loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and to Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, and the spirit of struggling for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory.

The article said that this is the fact. As for the fact that some people do not like the spirit of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and that some people are dissatisfied with the unity shown at the Congress and the Marxist-Leninist maturity of the reports and speeches, and dissatisfied with the solidarity of the international proletariat, this once again confirms the true colors of such people.

As for the so-called hints of "interference in Yugoslavia's internal development," this cannot help but remind one of the trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'!"

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian People's Republic strictly abide by the principle of non-interference in internal affairs in their relations with other parties and countries, and respect the independence and sovereignty of each country. However, the leadership group of the Yugoslav League of Communists does not do this. There are many facts that show that the Yugoslav side has repeatedly interfered in the internal affairs of our party and country, but they have been promptly opposed by the relevant Bulgarian authorities. Many facts prove that the Yugoslav side has tried its best to create chaos among certain strata of Bulgarian intellectuals and to ideologically disintegrate them.

Perhaps it is necessary to mention here the comments made by Yugoslav newspapers and certain Yugoslav leaders on Bulgaria after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in April. Perhaps one should mention the suspicious activities carried out by certain Yugoslav diplomats in the People's Republic of Bulgaria, which are inconsistent with general relations between countries. It is none other than the Yugoslav newspapers that have been constantly carrying out campaigns against our party and country, and against the party's line and policies.

All this shows that the Yugoslav leaders have deviated from the internationalist stance in their relations with other countries, inciting nationalist sentiments, artificially creating contradictions, and exacerbating the situation.

Tito attacked Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, insisting that it "attacked" not only the Yugoslav leaders, but also the "Yugoslav people." He attempted to deny the iron arguments in this famous speech on two issues: namely, the issue of US aid and the issue of the Cominform's 1948 resolution. The Yugoslav leaders tried to reverse black and white, describing US aid as lofty and humanitarian. According to Tito's statement, one could draw the following conclusions: First, the American imperialists sympathize with the starving Yugoslav people; second, they are the defenders of socialist countries.

What US aid is like and what kind of purposes it pursues is clear to everyone. Many examples in the world have proven this. Just look at the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and look at the military and economic intentions of the United States toward the territories of its British and French partners. Just look at the scenes in which the people of Latin American countries who enjoy America's "favor" and "aid" recently greeted US Vice President Nixon. The crude tone of the American President Eisenhower, an imperialist, frankly stated what Tito and the Yugoslav leadership group were trying to cover up with ambiguous words. Eisenhower confirmed at a press conference on the 18th of this month that he "still believes in the policy of aiding Soviet satellite countries, the purpose of which is to create conditions to weaken communism." Eisenhower believes that "aiding Yugoslavia makes it possible for this country to pursue a policy independent of the Soviet Union."

This is the true face of American "benevolence," this is the "concern" for strengthening the independence of socialist countries! There is nothing more to say.

The Yugoslav leaders screamed to the heavens when fraternal communist and workers' parties once again confirmed that the Cominform's 1948 resolution on the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was correct. After all, screams are screams, and facts are facts. The 1948 resolution criticized the Yugoslav leadership for implementing a wrong, nationalist line that deviated from Marxism-Leninism, for equating the Soviet Union's foreign policy with the foreign policy of imperialist countries, and for revising the Marxist-Leninist theory on classes, class struggle, and the role of the proletarian party. Didn't these errors receive further deepening, vivid expression, and systematic synthesis in the Ljubljana program?

The article then discussed the ugly deeds of the Yugoslav leaders during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956. The article stated that this behavior served the international imperialists well. Now, because the Hungarian judicial organs have given the Nagy Imre traitorous group the punishment it deserves, the Yugoslav newspapers and certain Yugoslav officials are shamelessly defending those counter-revolutionary ringleaders who caused the Hungarian people to shed blood, and are vociferously opposing Nagy and his accomplices from receiving the punishment they deserve. Their screams echo the screams of the most reactionary Western figures.

The article said that modern revisionism and its disgusting role are to lead the international communist movement and workers' movement astray, to undermine the unity of the movement, and to serve the reactionary forces of imperialism. This can only leave a shameful stain in history. This role and these experiences cannot be concealed by flowery words or the sophistry of pseudo-Marxism.

    诡辩帮助不了南斯拉夫的修正主义者
    ——评铁托在拉宾的演说（摘要）
    保加利亚“工人事业报”编辑部
    新华社索非亚26日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”23日刊登了一篇编辑部文章，题目是“诡辩帮助不了南斯拉夫的修正主义者。——评铁托在拉宾的演说”。
    文章说，铁托在拉宾发表的演说就其内容来看，其主要目的是再一次地为南共纲领的修正主义本质进行辩解，责难和诽谤共产党和工人党以及社会主义阵营。铁托实质上并没有答复人们对南共纲领所进行的马克思列宁主义的批评，而是对苏联及其领导、对各国共产党和工人党进行冷嘲热讽。正像在纲领中一样，在这篇演说里，对美帝国主义者也只字未提。铁托却极其恶毒地对中国共产党及其领导人，对保加利亚共产党及其第七次代表大会，对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党进行了攻击。可以毫不夸大地说，南斯拉夫领导人由于铁托的这篇演说最后地拿下了修正主义者和煽动家所戴的假面具，他们不择手段地来为自己的反马克思主义的立场辩护。
    铁托完全违反真实情况地歪曲了对南斯拉夫修正主义的批评的实质和性质。他诡辩地、别有用心地把这种批评说成是“对社会主义的南斯拉夫的攻击”，说成是“对南斯拉夫人民的诽谤”。在铁托看来，这次“运动”的主要原因在于，南共没有在莫斯科十二国宣言上签字和南斯拉夫拒绝参加“所谓（！）社会主义阵营”。
    文章说，如果硬把对南共修正主义纲领的批评说成是攻击南斯拉夫，那就是粗暴地歪曲事实真象。十分明显，这种批评是出于深刻原则性的考虑，是为了捍卫马克思列宁主义学说，使其不受机会主义和小资产阶级的歪曲。这种批评竭力向世界表明现代修正主义的真实面貌和指出它给国际共产主义运动和工人运动、给世界社会主义力量的团结带来的危险。大家都很清楚，共产党和工人党一向尊重一切国家的人民，其中也包括南斯拉夫人民。
    文章指出，南斯拉夫的路线在帝国主义阵营受到热烈欢迎和完全赞同，它们公开鼓励南斯拉夫领导人走“自己选择的道路”。历史事实表明，有利于帝国主义的，必然对社会主义、对工人阶级和劳动人民有害。谁不知道，在卢布尔雅那代表大会结束后，华盛顿和纽约的一些有影响的人士立刻就迫不及待地说，为了“美国的长远利益，必须迅速拨出给南斯拉夫的援助”。这种长远利益是什么，是容易理解的。如果南斯拉夫领导集团还认为它是世界共产主义运动的一部分的话，那末不妨提醒它一句老话：“如果敌人夸奖你，你就得想想自己干了什么蠢事！”。
    文章接着说，南共总书记在演说中对中国共产党及其领导人和报刊进行了粗暴的毫无道德的攻击。“人民日报”的文章和中国领导人关于南斯拉夫修正主义的言论被说成是“对社会主义南斯拉夫的残酷攻击”。
    文章说，全世界共产党人和劳动人民知道得非常清楚。国际共产主义运动和工人运动对中国共产党人和他们的伟大的党怀着最大的敬意和尊重，因为这个党对马克思列宁主义的宝库作出了巨大的贡献。几十年来，中国共产党同中国的封建主义、资本主义和外国帝国主义进行了浴血的斗争，并且引导中国人民取得了胜利。现在这个党正在组织和领导着规模巨大和速度空前的社会主义建设。中国共产党把马克思列宁主义的原则创造性地应用到中国的具体环境，运用前所未有的新形式去取得社会主义的胜利。但是中国的同志从来也不讲他们想出了自己的、中国走向社会主义的道路，而总是强调说，他们是沿着伟大的十月社会主义革命所指出的、在苏联经过考验的道路前进，他们运用着苏联共产党和苏联的具有世界历史意义的经验。
    中国共产党和中国领导人在世界上的威信是很高的。现代的冒牌马克思主义者无论他们如何拚命，要想污损中共和中国领导人的威信，无论从发展情况或是从力量来说，都是办不到的。
    文章指出，但是铁托到这里并没有停止。他走得更远，竟骇人听闻地指责中国领导人是……新战争贩子。这里用不着评论，只有在帝国主义宣传的厨房里才能庖制出这样的论点。结果产生了一个非常奇怪的景象：爱好和平的和民主的中国被指责为挑拨战争，而对真正的战争贩子——美帝国主义者却不敢说一个责难的字。此外，这里必须提起一个事实。不久之前，南斯拉夫报纸和南斯拉夫领导人暗示，似乎中国共产党赞成南斯拉夫的独立政策，似乎中国共产党不同意苏联以及其他社会主义国家对“南斯拉夫立场”的批评，似乎中国是站在南斯拉夫方面。这个恶意煽动的目的在于离间中国。大家知道，这个尝试碰了壁。
    现在，南斯拉夫报刊和南斯拉夫领导人来了个一百八十度的大转变。他们竭力企图说明，中国领导人用一种“特别的方式”来批评卢布尔雅那的纲领，其他国家共产党“不同意”这样的批评。自然，这是一种声东击西的说法，它同实际情况是毫无共同之处的。赫鲁晓夫在保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会上对这点作了最好不过的回答。
    铁托拉宾演说的一个目的是要贬低不久以前所召开的保共代表大会的意义，拒绝充满着马克思列宁主义原则性的中央委员会的总结报告、代表们的发言和赫鲁晓夫同志在代表大会上精辟的讲话所提出的公正的批评。在这方面，一如在对待中国同志的态度一样，为了达到自己的目的，什么话都说出来了。
    十分明显，无论是保加利亚领导人，或者是保加利亚报刊都没有进行欺侮和辱骂，大家知道，欺侮和辱骂是某种另外的人的专利权。保加利亚共产党和它的活动家认为自己的神圣义务是：反对任何对马克思列宁主义的歪曲，保卫它的旗帜、无产阶级国际主义旗帜的纯洁。我们具有历史意义的第七次代表大会的整个过程正是贯彻了对马克思列宁主义和保苏友谊的无限忠诚，为马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁而进行斗争的精神。
    文章说，事实就是这样。至于说有人不喜欢保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的精神，有人不满在代表大会上所表现出来的团结一致以及各项报告和发言的马克思列宁主义的成熟性，不满国际无产阶级的团结，这就再一次证实了这种人的本来面目。
    至于谈到所谓“干涉南斯拉夫内部发展”的暗示，这使人不禁想起“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩！
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国在自己同其他党和国家的关系中严格遵守不干涉内政的原则，尊重每个国家的独立和主权。但是，南共领导集团却不是这样做的。有许多事实说明，南斯拉夫方面一再干涉我们党和国家的内政，但是，都及时地遭到了保加利亚有关机关的反对。许多事实证明，南斯拉夫方面极力想在保加利亚知识分子某些阶层中间制造混乱和在思想上瓦解他们。
    也许有必要在这里提一提南斯拉夫报纸和南斯拉夫某些领导人在保加利亚共产党中央委员会四月全会以后对保加利亚的言论。也许应该提一提某些南斯拉夫外交官在保加利亚人民共和国所进行的令人怀疑的、不符合国家间一般关系的活动。不是别人，正是南斯拉夫报纸一直不停地进行反对我们党和国家、反对党的路线和政策的运动。
    这一切表明，南斯拉夫领导人在同其他国家的关系中脱离了国际主义的立场，煽动民族主义情绪，人为地制造矛盾，使局势尖锐化。
    铁托攻击赫鲁晓夫同志在保共代表大会上的讲话，硬说其中“攻击”的不仅是南斯拉夫领导人，而且是“南斯拉夫人民”。在两个问题上，他企图否认这个著名演说中的铁的论据：即在美援问题上和共产党情报局1948年的决议问题上。南斯拉夫领导人力图颠倒黑白，把美援说成是崇高的、人道的。根据铁托的说法就可得出这样的结论：第一，美帝国主义者同情受饥挨饿的南斯拉夫人民；第二，他们是社会主义国家的保卫者。
    美援是什么样的东西，它所追求的是什么样的目的，这是大家都很清楚的。世界上的很多实例都证明了这一点。只要看看“艾森豪威尔主义”，看看美国对它的英法伙伴的领地所抱的军事和经济意图就够了。只要看看享受美国的“恩惠”和“援助”的拉丁美洲国家人民不久前迎接美国副总统尼克松的场面就够了。美国总统艾森豪威尔的帝国主义者的粗鲁口吻直言不讳地说出了铁托和南斯拉夫领导集团企图用含糊词句来加以掩饰的东西。艾森豪威尔在本月18日的记者招待会上确认，他“仍然相信援助苏联卫星国的政策，其目的是创造条件来削弱共产主义”。艾森豪威尔认为，“援助南斯拉夫就有可能使这个国家执行不依赖于苏联的政策。”
    这就是美国“仁慈”的真面目，这就是对加强社会主义国家独立的“关怀”！再没有什么好说的了。
    由于兄弟共产党和工人党再一次确认1948年情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党的状况的决议是正确的，南斯拉夫领导人叫嚣得简直上了天。叫嚣毕竟是叫嚣，事实终究是事实。1948年的决议批评南斯拉夫的领导实行了错误的、背离马克思列宁主义的民族主义路线，批评南斯拉夫领导人把苏联的外交政策同帝国主义国家的外交政策等量齐观，批评他们修正马克思列宁主义关于阶级、阶级斗争和无产阶级政党作用的学说。难道这些错误没有在卢布尔雅那的纲领中得到进一步的深化、鲜明的表现和系统的综合么？
    文章接着谈到南斯拉夫领导人在1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱期间所干的丑事。文章说，这种行为替国际帝国主义者很好地效了劳。现在，由于匈牙利司法机关给予纳吉·伊姆雷叛国集团应有的惩罚，南斯拉夫报刊和某些南斯拉夫官方人士竟恬不知耻地维护那些使匈牙利人民血流成河的反革命头子，声嘶力竭地反对使纳吉和他的同谋者受到应得的惩罚。他们的叫嚣同最反动的西方人士的叫嚣互相呼应。
    文章说，现代修正主义及其令人作呕的作用，是使国际共产主义运动和工人运动脱离正确的道路，破坏运动的团结一致，为帝国主义反动势力服务。这在历史上只能留下可耻的斑迹。这个作用和这些经验不是花言巧语，不是冒牌的马克思主义的诡辩所能掩饰得了的。
