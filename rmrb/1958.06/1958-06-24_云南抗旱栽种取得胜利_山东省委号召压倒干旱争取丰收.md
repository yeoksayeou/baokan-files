Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd. The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have repelled a drought unseen in many years, and have achieved a decisive victory in drought-resistant planting.
　　As of the 19th, Yunnan Province had planted 64.9% of its rice, 75.2% of its potatoes, 70% of its flue-cured tobacco, and exceeded its plans for corn and sugarcane. At present, most areas of Yunnan Province have entered the rainy season, and farmers everywhere are continuing to fight based on the principle of "seizing opportunities to plant when it rains, and persisting in fighting drought when it doesn't." It is expected that rice planting will be basically completed by the end of this month, more than one season earlier than last year, and the sowing of other crops will also be completed earlier than last year.
　　Since last winter, Yunnan has not had rain for nine months, and some rivers that never dry up have been exposed. According to old farmers, this is the worst drought they have seen in forty years.
　　According to meteorological forecasts, the rainy season in Yunnan this year will be delayed by more than a month compared to previous years. Waiting for rain to plant would delay the season, which means reduced production. Therefore, the leading organs decided to advance the season, plant while fighting drought, and strive for a bumper harvest. People of all ethnic groups saw favorable factors in the difficulties: hot weather, water, ground heat, and sufficient sunlight made seedlings grow faster, which further strengthened their determination to fight the drought. In the vast rural areas, more than 70% of the labor force was invested in the fight against drought. Workers worked day and night to rush to manufacture water-lifting tools. Commercial departments "transformed stores into peddlers' loads and transformed field ridges into counters," ensuring the needs of rural production and life. All organs and schools also drew people to support.
　　In the struggle against drought, the masses further developed the power of the collective. Qilu County organized eight large armies with a total of more than 20,000 people, using 15,000 waterwheels to scoop water from Qilu Lake and underground water, irrigating 3,000 to 4,000 mu of land a day. In Nuozu Township, Huaning, 130 water scoops were used to draw water from the Panjiang River to the hills. Drought had to retreat three times in the face of the heroic people.
　　Due to the hot weather, sufficient base fertilizer, and good planting quality, various crops are growing well.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held another radio conference on drought resistance, rush planting and seedling protection on the evening of the 20th. Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, made a report at the meeting. He said that most areas of the province are now showing signs of drought, with more than 100 million mu of cultivated land not having received soaking rain since the spring, of which more than 30 million mu have not received soaking rain for more than 200 days since last autumn. Coupled with the wind and sun these days, the ground temperature has increased and the spring seedlings are withering. Only more than 10 million mu of the province's 60 million mu of summer stubble land have been sown, and there are now less than 20 days left for suitable planting time. In this short period of time, if the summer stubble land cannot be rushed to plant completely, and the spring seedlings that have already been sown cannot be protected, the completion of the annual production increase plan will be seriously threatened. Tan Qilong said that we must face up to the current serious situation, think in the worst possible terms, work towards the positive aspects, prepare for more time without rain in the future, and even a major drought of a year without rain, we must also overcome the drought and seize a bumper harvest to ensure the realization of the annual production plan of 35 billion catties of grain.

### 云南抗旱栽种取得胜利  山东省委号召压倒干旱争取丰收

    云南抗旱栽种取得胜利
    山东省委号召压倒干旱争取丰收
    本报昆明23日电  云南各族人民击退了历年罕见的大干旱，抗旱栽种已取得决定性的胜利。
    截至19日止，云南全省水稻已栽64.9％，薯类已种75.2％，烤烟70％，包谷和甘蔗都超过了计划。目前云南省大部分地区都已进入雨季，各地农民正本着“有雨突击抢栽，无雨坚持抗旱”的原则继续战斗着。预计水稻栽插可在本月底基本结束，比去年提早了一个多节令，其他作物的播种也要比去年提前结束。
    去冬以来，云南有九个月没有下雨，有些从来不干的河道都露了底。据老农说：这是四十年来没有见过的大干旱。
    根据气象预报，云南今年的雨季要比往年推迟一个多月。等雨栽种，推迟节令，就是减产。因此领导机关决定：提前节令抗旱栽种，争取大丰收。各族人民从困难中看到了有利的因素：旱天水热、地热、阳光足，秧苗长得快，更坚定了抗旱的决心。在广大农村中，70％多的劳动力都投入了抗旱斗争。工人们夜以继日的赶制提水工具。商业部门“变门市部为货郎担，变田埂为柜台”，保证了农村生产上生活上的需要。各机关学校也都抽人支援。
    在抗旱斗争中，群众进一步发挥了集体的力量。杞麓县组织了八路大军共两万多人，用一万五千张水车戽杞麓湖水和地下水，一天灌田三、四千亩。华宁的糯租乡戽水一百三十道，把盘江水引上了山岗。干旱在英雄的人民的面前，不得不退避三舍。
    由于天气热、底肥足、栽种质量好，各种庄稼长得都不错。
    据新华社济南22日电  中共山东省委20日晚再次举行抗旱抢种保苗广播大会。山东省委书记处书记谭启龙在会上作了报告。他说，现在全省大部地区都呈现旱象，有一亿多亩耕地入春以来未下过透地雨，其中有三千多万亩从去秋以来二百多天未下过透地雨，加上这几天风吹日晒，地温增高，春苗枯萎；全省六千万亩夏茬地才播种了一千多万亩，而今后的宜种时间已不足二十天。在这短时间里，如不能把夏茬地全部抢种好，不能保住已经播种的春苗，全年增产计划的完成就要受到严重威胁。谭启龙说，我们必须正视当前的严重情况，从最坏的方面着想，向积极的方面努力，准备在今后更多的时间不下雨，甚至出现一年不下雨的大旱灾，也要压倒干旱夺取丰收，保证全年生产三百五十亿斤粮食的计划实现。
