Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 17th: The personnel of the Shahe Police Station of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau boldly emancipated their minds and resolutely implemented the mass line. Recently, they solved 96% of the criminal cases accumulated since liberation in a very short period. Many long-standing and difficult cases were brought to light in a few days through mass tip-offs and discussions. As of June 13, no criminal cases had occurred in the jurisdiction of this police station for two and a half months.

The methods used by the Shahe Public Security Police Station to implement the mass line in handling accumulated cases are mainly: vigorously publicizing the relevant policies of the Party and the government, explaining the great significance of relying on the masses to do a good job in public security work, and then writing the case details into big-character posters for public display, while pointing out that only by confessing and surrendering can criminals find a way out. Then, they adopt the method of "big blooming, big contending" and general discussion to mobilize the masses to present the situation, provide clues, and expose criminals. A case of writing reactionary slogans once occurred in the public toilet on Yudongxi Road, Shahe Town. The police used methods such as posting big-character posters to inform the masses of the relevant situation and let everyone identify it. The masses were very angry when they learned that bad people were writing reactionary slogans, and actively assisted the police station in solving the case. After observing the scene, the masses believed that this toilet was very remote and no strangers were found to have entered it that day. In this way, the scope of investigation was greatly reduced. After further handwriting identification, more than ten people unanimously believed that it was done by Li Guihong, a counter-revolutionary element who had served as a Kuomintang bandit soldier, had engaged in robbery activities in the early days of liberation, had always been dissatisfied with the government, and often listened to "Voice of America". This case, which one police officer had investigated for nearly three months using "secret methods" without success, was finally solved in a few days by relying on the masses.

Another method used by the Shahe Police Station to mobilize the masses to solve cases is to convey the case situation to activists, who assist in visiting the parties involved and the surrounding masses, study the case with the masses, and find clues to solve the case. A case of stealing crops occurred in Shipai Village in August 1954. Recently, after this police station handed the case over to activists, the activists learned a clue from a resident, Chi Rui'e, through visiting the masses: early that morning, Chi Rui'e went to the field and saw a person running away from the ginger field in a panic, and as a result, the ginger was found to be missing. Chi Rui'e recognized that the person was her fellow villager, Pan Guangying. According to this clue, many facts were revealed, proving that Pan Guangying was a habitual thief. After verification, the criminal Pan Guangying, who stole crops, was brought out by the masses.

The Shahe Police Station's mobilization of the masses to assist in solving cases has also greatly improved the revolutionary vigilance of the masses. Recently, the masses have reported and exposed 1,502 pieces of various materials to the public security organs. Criminals have been completely isolated among the masses, and they have surrendered themselves to the authorities one after another. Currently, more than 100 criminals have surrendered themselves to the public security organs, expressing their willingness to be new people.

    广州公安局沙河派出所贯彻群众路线
    积压的疑难案件一一破案
    新华社广州17日电　广州市公安局沙河派出所人员大胆解放思想，坚决贯彻群众路线，最近在很短时间内就把解放以来96％的刑事积案破获了。不少长期积压的疑难案件，经过群众检举和讨论，在几天内就真相大白。到6月13日止，这个派出所辖区内已经两个半月没有发生过刑事案件。
    沙河公安派出所在处理积案工作中贯彻群众路线的办法，主要是：大张旗鼓地宣传党和政府的有关方针政策，说明依靠群众做好公安工作的重大意义，然后把案情写成大字报公开张贴，同时指出案犯只有坦白自首才有出路。接着，采取大鸣大放、大家讨论的方式，发动群众摆情况，提线索，揭发犯罪分子。沙河镇禺东西路公厕曾经发生一宗涂写反动标语案件。公安人员就用贴出大字报等方法把有关情况告诉群众，让大家辨认。群众知道有坏人写反动标语，都很气愤，积极协助派出所破案。群众观察现场后，认为这个厕所很偏僻，当天没有发现生人进去。这样，便把侦查范围大大缩小。再经过辨认笔迹，有十多人一致认为这是一个曾经当过国民党匪兵、解放初期还进行过抢劫活动、一贯对政府不满、常收听“美国之音”的反革命分子李桂洪所为。这件案子，有一个公安人员曾用“秘密方法”侦查了将近三个月没有破案，终于依靠群众在几天内就破案了。
    沙河派出所发动群众破案的另一个方法，是把案件情况向积极分子传达，由积极分子协助访问当事人和周围群众，同群众研究案情，从中找出线索加以破案。石牌村在1954年8月发生一宗盗窃农作物案件。最近这个派出所把案子交给积极分子以后，积极分子就通过访问群众，从居民池瑞娥那里了解到一个线索：那天凌晨，池瑞娥往地里走，看见一个人从姜地里狼狈地逃走了，结果这块地就发现失姜事件。池瑞娥认得那人是同乡潘光应。根据这一线索，又有人揭露许多事实，证明潘光应是一个惯窃。经过查对以后，盗窃农作物的罪犯潘光应便被群众揪出来了。
    沙河派出所发动群众协助破案，也大大提高了群众的革命警惕性。最近以来，群众向公安机关检举、揭发的各种材料就有一千五百零二件。犯罪分子在群众中已完全陷于孤立，纷纷投案自首。目前已有一百多名罪犯向公安机关投案自首，表示愿意重新做人。
