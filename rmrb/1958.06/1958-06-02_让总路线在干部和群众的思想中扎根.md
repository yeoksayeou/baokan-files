　　Determine June as a movement month for publicizing the General Line. Organize a 500,000-strong team to promote the General Line.
    The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision.
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 1st dispatch) The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on May 31st, deciding to immediately convey the documents and spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to all Communist Party members in Shandong Province universally and conscientiously, and to immediately organize a propaganda team of 500,000 people throughout the province to vigorously launch the promotion and implementation of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and to determine June as the movement month for publicizing the General Line, so as to achieve a situation where every household knows it and everyone is aware of it.
    The meeting requested that all localities, during the conveyance, should particularly emphasize explaining that: going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is the only correct General Line for building socialism, the pointer for all work, and the general driving force for all work to advance; continue to criticize all right-leaning conservative viewpoints, to further promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the province; further deeply understand the fine style of our Party consistently following the mass line as pointed out by Chairman Mao, thereby promoting the continued deepening of the Party's rectification campaign and achieving complete victory; correctly understand the significance of the communist style of breaking superstitions, independent thinking, and cutting off inferiority complex and establishing self-confidence as pointed out by Chairman Mao.
    When conveying the meeting documents and spirit, it is required to pay special attention to combining it with solving ideological and practical problems in current production, promoting a large-scale drought resistance movement, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest, completing spring sowing in a timely and comprehensive manner, ensuring full and vigorous seedlings, and ensuring the smooth progress of summer harvesting and summer planting; promoting the rapid development of local industry throughout the province and overfulfilling production plans.
　　Turn the enthusiasm of the masses in responding to the Party's call into the power to accomplish current urgent tasks.
　　The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China arranges for the promotion and study of the General Line.
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 1st dispatch) The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on May 30th, attended by the secretaries and propaganda ministers of city, prefectural, and county party committees and party committees of directly subordinate factories and mines, to arrange for cadres at all levels throughout the province to study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and vigorously promote the work of the General Line for socialist construction among the masses. The Provincial Party Committee believes that it is necessary to seize the opportunity of the announcement of the conference documents to first vigorously launch a movement to study and promote the General Line. It is required that in cities and villages, according to different conditions, within a week to half a month, all cadres, workers, students, farmers, urban residents, and people from all social strata should know the basic content of the General Line, understand the tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and clarify the goal of catching up with Britain in a shorter time. It is necessary to ensure that every household knows it and that the red flag of the General Line is planted throughout the province. With the General Line as the political driving force, the rectification movement and production and work throughout the province should be continuously pushed forward.
    The Provincial Party Committee requires that leading cadres at all levels should first conscientiously study and discuss the documents and spirit of the conference in connection with the rectification and current work, and write notes,心得(xinde, insights gained from study), and articles that combine theory with practice during the study. Leading cadres should lead and help cadres study and participate in and guide the propaganda work to the masses. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the focus of cadres' theoretical study in the future should be on studying Chairman Mao's works and understanding Chairman Mao's thought. Schools above the secondary level should formulate educational plans for the General Line of socialist construction.
    The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that in the propaganda, it is necessary to fully promote the enthusiasm and revolutionary fervor of the masses in responding to the Party's call and implementing the General Line, and be good at guiding the enthusiasm and energy of the masses into actions to accomplish current tasks.
    The Provincial Party Committee emphasized: Liberating the mind among the broad masses of cadres and people, breaking the superstitions, fears, and inferiority complexes left over from history, and getting rid of the state of "spiritual slaves" is the key to implementing the General Line.
　　Extensively launch popular propaganda to make it known to every family of all ethnic groups.
    The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to party committees at all levels.
    (Our newspaper, Xining, 1st dispatch) The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to party committees at all levels on May 31st regarding the study and promotion of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. The notice pointed out: Organizing all cadres to conscientiously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and extensively publicizing the Party's General Line for socialist construction to the broad masses of the people is a major political task for party organizations at all levels. The notice proposed:
    1. Leading comrades at all levels should make popular reports to cadres and people of all ethnic groups based on conscientiously studying the documents and closely integrating them with reality.
    2. Organize propaganda forces, make full use of various propaganda tools, and conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda among the people of all ethnic groups to achieve a situation where every household knows it.
    According to the above instructions, provincial-level units and units in Xining City have widely conveyed the message among cadres and have listed the study of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress as one of the study centers in the fourth stage of the rectification campaign.
    Carry the rectification movement through to the end in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.
    The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to party committees at all levels.
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 1st dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently notified party committees at all levels to organize cadres to study the General Line well and carry the rectification movement through to the end. The notice required that the "Two Antis" movement be carried through to the end in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress". At the end of the "Two Antis" movement, a general inspection should be conducted to see if all units have raised the red flag. If there are any shortcomings, remedial lessons should be conducted immediately. The movement of "surrendering hearts to the Party" currently being carried out in major universities, colleges, industry and commerce, democratic parties, and other fields should also be thoroughly inspected to see if the direction is correct and whether the will to take the socialist road has been strengthened. Through inspection, problems should be identified, measures should be taken to improve them, and efforts should be made to move forward on the road of being both red and expert, red and deep, on the basis of thoroughly discrediting bourgeois individualism and leaning towards the Party. The notice requires the immediate organization of all cadres to study the various documents of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" and to combine the organization of study with the "Two Antis" to thoroughly liberate the mind, break superstitions, and examine and overcome the "three styles" and "five airs" through study.
