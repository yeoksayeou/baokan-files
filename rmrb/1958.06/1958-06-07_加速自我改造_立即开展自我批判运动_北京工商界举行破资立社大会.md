Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: More than 8,000 people from Beijing's industrial and commercial circles held a meeting today to implement the general line of socialist construction, to destroy capitalism and establish socialism. The meeting called on the city's industrial and commercial circles to accelerate their self-transformation and immediately launch a self-criticism movement based on open-hearted self-examination.

Pu Jiexiu, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported on the situation of the rectification campaign and self-examination in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles. Pu Jiexiu said that the city's industrial and commercial circles began the self-examination movement in early April, and so far, more than six million erroneous thoughts and behaviors have been confessed. This demonstrates the determination of Beijing's industrialists and merchants to transform themselves and move closer to the Party. Our main task in implementing the Party's general line is to exert full effort, push the rectification movement to a new climax, conduct in-depth self-criticism based on open-hearted self-examination, and then formulate a self-transformation plan.

Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice Chairman Tang Shaoyuan, Yu Jingsheng, Chairman of the Dongcheng District Federation of Industry and Commerce, Lu Shouru, staff member of the Beijing Electrical Machinery Factory and former manager of Quanhe Electrical Machinery Factory, and Hou Dianju, Head of the Supply and Marketing Section of the jointly owned Li Qun Iron Factory, successively made preliminary self-criticisms at the meeting. In their self-criticisms, they examined their bourgeois stand and erroneous words and deeds on various issues such as the socialist transformation, the "Five-Anti" campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the leadership of the Party.

The meeting held that the self-examination movement has come to an end, and a self-criticism movement should be launched immediately in order to accelerate self-transformation, strive to basically end self-criticism by the 20th, and formulate a self-transformation plan.

    加速自我改造　立即开展自我批判运动
    北京工商界举行破资立社大会
    据新华社6日讯　北京市工商界八千多人今天举行贯彻社会主义建设总路线破资立社大会。大会号召全市工商界加速自我改造，在自我交心的基础上，立即开展自我批判运动。
    民主建国会北京市委员会主任委员、北京市工商业联合会副主任委员浦洁修在会上报告了北京市工商界进行整风、自我交心的情况。浦洁修说，全市工商界4月初开始了自我交心运动，到目前为止，已交出各种错误思想言行六百多万条。这表现了北京工商业者改造自己、向党靠拢的决心。当前我们贯彻执行党的总路线的主要任务是：鼓足干劲，把整风运动推向新的高潮，在自我交心的基础上，深入地进行自我批判，然后订出自我改造规划。
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生、副主任委员汤绍远和东城区工商业联合会主任委员俞京生、北京市电机厂职员、原全合电机厂经理鹿受如、公私合营利群铁工厂供销科长侯殿举等先后在大会上做了初步的自我批判。他们在自我批判中检查了自己在对待社会主义改造、“五反”、反右派斗争、党的领导等各种问题上的资产阶级立场和错误的言行。
    大会认为自我交心运动已告一段落，现在应该立即展开自我批判运动，以便加速改造自己，争取在20日前自我批判基本结束，并订出自我改造规划。
