    Atomic War Profiteer

    A beer merchant in Boulton-on-Trent, England, announced that once Britain is subjected to hydrogen bomb attacks, they will supply bottled beer to areas where reservoirs have been contaminated by radioactivity. The British Home Office approved the plan because it said that as long as the radioactivity on the outside of the bottles is wiped off, the bottled beer will not be affected by atomic radiation.

    原子战争财迷
    英国布尔顿—翁—特兰特地方的啤酒商人宣布说，一旦英国受到氢弹轰炸，凡是储水池受到放射性污染的地区，他们将供给瓶装啤酒。英国内政部赞成这项计划，因为它说，只须将瓶子外面的放射性污染拭去，瓶装的啤酒就不会受到原子放射性的影响。
