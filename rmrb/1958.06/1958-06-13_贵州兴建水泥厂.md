Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 11th. A Guiyang Cement Plant, which will provide a large amount of cement for the construction of mountainous areas in Guizhou, began construction in early June. After its completion, it will have an annual output of 315,000 tons of cement of different grades, equivalent to six times Guizhou Province's current cement production.

The Guiyang Cement Plant is being built with central government investment. It is a large-scale plant, and many processes, from limestone mining to finished product packaging, are mechanized.

The plant was originally planned to be completed in 1961. However, after studying the general line for socialist construction, the construction workers recently reduced some unnecessary construction projects and lowered some excessively high construction standards, while maintaining production capacity. This will allow the completion time to be advanced to October next year, and save 12 million yuan in investment.

    贵州兴建水泥厂
    新华社贵阳11日电　一座为建设贵州山区提供大量水泥的贵阳水泥厂6月初动工兴建。它建成后，能年产不同标号的水泥三十一万五千吨，相当贵州省目前水泥产量的六倍。
    贵阳水泥厂是由中央投资兴建的，规模较大，从开采石灰石到包装成品，许多工序都是机械化的。
    这个厂原计划在1961年建成。但是建厂职工们在最近学习了社会主义建设总路线以后，在生产能力不变的情况下，削减了一些不必要的工程项目，降低了一些过高的建筑标准，因而可以使建成时间提前到明年10月份，并且可以节约投资一千二百万元。
