　　Editor's note: Our socialist construction is developing vigorously and thriving. A county is an important combat unit. Only by proceeding from the overall situation, combining it with local conditions, making comprehensive deployments, and grasping all economic undertakings such as agriculture, industry, and commerce, as well as various cultural and educational undertakings, can we be conducive to combat, avoid losing sight of the other, or losing focus. This deployment is comprehensive planning. Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang, provides good experience in this regard. Their method of formulating plans is a Marxist-Leninist method of fully mobilizing and relying on the masses. Therefore, the plan is both advanced and practical, both central and comprehensive. The result of doing so is:
　　The leadership of county-level organs over various construction tasks has been strengthened, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production and construction has been further enhanced, and the development of various construction undertakings has been faster.
　　In the previous period, under the help and guidance of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, we formulated a comprehensive plan for socialist construction. Within five years, agricultural production will be increased from 4,198 jin per hectare to 10,000 jin, and the output value of industrial production will increase from 10 million yuan in 1957 to 180 million yuan; sideline production will increase from 7 million yuan in 1957 to 43 million yuan. Within five years, farmland irrigation, agricultural mechanization, fertilization and chemical fertilization, rural electrification, township industrialization, transportation modernization, barren mountain and surrounding greening, education popularization, living sanitation, and housing brick and tile construction will be realized successively. Due to the method of planning and acting simultaneously, 98 small and medium-sized factories have been designed, built, and put into production, and 185 agricultural cooperatives have established 293 sideline production bases such as reed ponds, orchards, rabbit breeding, beekeeping, silkworm breeding, and fish ponds. In just 25 days, the masses have raised 990,000 yuan.

　　A Long-Standing Problem
　　Our county is a rich mountainous area with "eight parts mountains, one part water, and one part farmland." Not only is there great potential for developing agriculture, but also abundant native, sideline, and special products and mineral resources are hidden in the mountains and forests. As the masses say, "There is no place where money cannot be made from what flies in the sky, grows on the mountains, runs in the forests, swims in the water, and is buried underground." However, due to our insufficient understanding of the characteristics of mountain production and our lack of experience in organizing the development of multi-sectoral economy, sharp contradictions have often arisen in terms of labor, capital, and time between agriculture and diversified operations over the years. Many cooperatives often grasped one aspect and lost the other, failing to achieve comprehensive increase in production and faster increase in income. Some cooperatives focused on sideline occupations and neglected agriculture as the central link, resulting in increased sideline production but no increase in agricultural production. Most cooperatives only focused on agriculture and neglected diversified operations, resulting in a slight increase in agricultural production year by year, but a gradual decrease in sideline income. Precisely because of this situation, many valuable mountain and special product resources in the mountains were lost and wasted, unable to be rationally utilized. We conducted a survey of several major varieties in the county: the highest annual output of wild ginseng in history was 1,500 taels, while only 270 taels were produced in 1957; the highest production of yuan bark was 10,000 sheets, while only 500 sheets were produced in 1956; the highest annual output of tree fungus was 100,000 jin, while only 100 jin were harvested in 1957. Due to the reduction in output, it was not enough for self-consumption, and more than 1,500 jin of tree fungus were imported from inside the customs. Therefore, the masses said with dissatisfaction: "Living in a treasure trove, sideline occupations are not doing well, not idle for a year, not earning much money." Due to this situation, contradictions often occurred between cooperatives and members, and between agricultural cooperatives and other economic sectors. For example, some cooperatives managed members' sideline occupations too strictly, and the cooperatives did not actively operate them, resulting in a large number of operating convenience conditions for individual households. Many individual households took the opportunity to make a fortune, and many members demanded to withdraw from the cooperatives to engage in individual work or leave the cooperative's production to engage in sideline occupations, which seriously affected the consolidation of the cooperatives. On the other hand, the reduction in the output of mountain products, native products, and special products has also affected some local industrial production. For example, the Yimianpo Winery planned to purchase 1,000 tons of grapes last year, but only 395 tons were received, reducing the output value by 1.26 million yuan. The impact on handicrafts, supply and marketing departments, and urban supply is also very significant.

　　Since last autumn, after the rectification campaign and the socialist debate, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses in our county have been unprecedentedly high, and a new situation of unprecedented production leap forward has emerged. Under the inspiration of the higher-level Party and the promotion of this situation, the County Party Committee proposed that the county achieve the target of the National Agricultural Development Program of 400 jin per mu within one year. Because this requirement reflected the wishes of the broad masses, it received an enthusiastic response from the vast number of farmers after the task was put forward. They broke with historical conventions, built reservoirs and delivered manure fertilizer in the frozen ground, and almost all men and women were involved in this upsurge of agricultural production leap forward. They completed 162 water conservancy projects and accumulated 2 million cubic meters of manure fertilizer in one winter. However, precisely because of this situation, the amount of labor used in agriculture increased by about 50% compared with last year, and the contradictions between agriculture and diversified operations became more acute. Many agricultural cooperatives only focused on agriculture and not sideline occupations, and even attempted to withdraw the labor and livestock that were already engaged in sideline occupations to invest in water conservancy and manure fertilizer campaigns. In addition, some cooperative leaders simply wanted to achieve 400 jin per mu, and wanted to reduce soybeans and other economic crops by planting a variety of high-yield crops. In the measures such as sending manure, they also focused on high-yield crops such as corn and rice, and neglected comprehensive increase in production.

　　In February of this year, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call for hard work for three years and achieving the 40 articles of the Agricultural Development Program in seven years, which not only further required doing a good job in diversified operations, but also required local industry and other undertakings to closely follow the leap forward in agriculture. Therefore, this long-standing problem was raised to a more important position.

　　Found the Key to Solving the Problem
　　In order to solve this problem, the County Party Committee had taken many measures. However, the contradiction between agriculture and diversified operations had never been fundamentally resolved. It was not until this year that the advanced experience of "relying on the masses, having a center, having a backbone, comprehensive planning, and comprehensive leap forward" created by Weihe Town enlightened us and made us find a key to solving the problem. The main experiences of Weihe Town are:
　　First, widely mobilize the masses to participate in formulating plans: overcome the bias of "seeing things but not people" in formulating plans, and broaden the leadership's thinking. Second, there are both comprehensive and comprehensive plans, as well as centers and backbones. Taking agriculture, sideline occupations, and industry as the center, all aspects of work are strung together on one line to achieve the purpose of mutual promotion and comprehensive leap forward. Third, planning, publicizing, and acting simultaneously corrected the bias of statically formulating plans; therefore, the plan was not only implemented, but also became a driving force for promoting current work.

　　On March 23, we held an on-site meeting in Weihe Town for comprehensive planning of various townships and towns, and introduced Weihe's experience. Through this meeting, not only were the main contents of the plan and the methods to be adopted clarified, but also the concerns about affecting current agricultural production by engaging in planning were eliminated. After the Weihe meeting, various townships and towns universally carried out planning work. In order to strengthen the leadership of comprehensive planning work and current production, the County Party Committee on the one hand organized personnel to go to the countryside to check on spring plowing and guide the planning work of various townships and cooperatives. On the other hand, it immediately began to carry out the comprehensive plan of the county. The County Party Committee divided the work, headed by a secretary and a county magistrate, and at the same time organized and transferred 17 department, bureau, and section-level cadres and 61 business personnel. With the help of the province, they were divided into 12 planning groups (agriculture, sideline occupations, animal husbandry, forestry, industry, postal and telecommunications, transportation, commerce, finance and banking, labor population, culture and education, health, political and legal affairs), and a comprehensive group, and carried out planning separately. In order to closely cooperate with and promote current work, and in the entire process of planning work, the method of planning and acting simultaneously was adhered to, and at each meeting to study planning issues, the current problems of spring plowing, eliminating the four pests, and eliminating illiteracy were also studied and handled. The persons in charge of leading the spring plowing work in each division and contracting area were also responsible for checking and promoting the planning work of townships and cooperatives, thus avoiding the phenomenon of the plan being divorced from current production.

　　Having a Center, Having a Backbone, Comprehensive Planning, Comprehensive Leap Forward
　　Under the inspiration of the comprehensive leap forward in Weihe Town, the thinking of cadres at the county and township levels was suddenly enlightened. The Weihe Town meeting laid a good ideological foundation for comprehensive planning and comprehensive leap forward. However, on the other hand, some departments and cadres had phenomena such as unclear priorities, lack of urgency, and unclear central backbone. For example, in terms of health work, it was planned to establish an obstetrics hospital, but no attention was paid to Kashin-Beck disease, which seriously endangers the health of the people in our county and affects production; in terms of culture and education, it was required to invest 50,000 yuan to establish a professional troupe, and no proposal was made to establish an industrial vocational school according to needs. Therefore, clarifying the center and backbone has become a fundamental issue that must be resolved in planning. In solving this problem, the method we adopted was: guiding cadres to specifically analyze the production characteristics of our county, the relationship between production and life, needs and possibilities, and urgency and slowness, and especially focusing on studying the laws of national economic development, thereby clarifying the relationship between the center and the comprehensive, and the backbone and the general. After analysis and research, according to the characteristics of our county's large agricultural production potential and rich native, sideline, and special product resources, we determined that we should focus on the development of agriculture, sideline occupations, and local industry; and among these three, agriculture should be the axis.

　　First, regarding agriculture: The county currently has 67,000 hectares of cultivated land, and it is planned to reach 75,000 hectares by 1962. The yield per hectare will reach 6,000 jin in 1958 and 10,000 jin in 1962. The backbone measures taken to achieve this target are:
　　(1) Achieve irrigation within three years. The county has 17 large and small rivers and 120 pools and marshes, with an annual rainfall of about 700 mm and a total runoff of about 1.9 billion cubic meters, which is suitable for building water conservancy and developing rice fields. Based on this favorable condition, the rice field planting area will be expanded from 9,000 hectares in 1957 to 45,000 hectares in 1962, accounting for 60% of the total cultivated land. (2) Achieve cultivation mechanization within three years. According to the principle of combining horses, cattle, and machines now and combining machines, cattle, and horses in the future, in addition to seizing the reform of tools, we initially plan to need 100 medium-sized locomotives, 190 small locomotives, 1,600 walking tractors, and corresponding agricultural machinery. The realization of this plan not only solves the contradiction of insufficient labor caused by the development of paddy fields, and can achieve intensive cultivation, timely sowing, and increased output, but also free up labor to engage in diversified operations. (3) Achieve fertilization and chemical fertilization within three years. By 1962, the amount of manure fertilizer per hectare will reach more than 50,000 jin, and an additional 400 jin of chemical fertilizer can be applied (600 jin for paddy fields).

　　Second, regarding sideline occupations: Our county is particularly rich in by-products, and is rich in more than 200 kinds of wild animals and plants such as mountain grapes, strawberries, toads, yuan grindstones, tree fungus, Schisandra chinensis, ginseng, and deer antlers. After planning, the total value of sideline production in the county will reach 14.25 million yuan in 1958 and 45 million yuan in 1962. There are three backbone measures to achieve this plan: (1) Combining "collecting, raising, catching, and planting." (2) Expanding the scope of collective operation and appropriately reducing the proportion of individual operation; (3) Strengthening the acquisition of native and special products.

　　Third, regarding industry: Our county is very rich in mineral resources. According to preliminary data, there are 15 kinds of coal, gold, copper, iron, limestone, marble, mica, graphite, and apatite. There are also many rivers suitable for hydropower generation, and mountain and special products can be used to vigorously develop industry. We plan to build 702 small and medium-sized industries and workshops within five years, and the total industrial output value will reach 180 million yuan by 1962, an increase of 16 times compared with 1957. In order to achieve the above indicators, within two years, seven industrial systems will be established - "seven dragons," namely: (1) Taking water energy as the mainstay, building 268 thermal power, hydropower, and biogas power stations, and the power capacity can reach 5,780 kilowatts by 1962. (2) Mining small coal mines in Fengshan, Dingshan, Wujimi and other places, with an annual output of 250,000 tons of coal by 1962. (3) Using local raw coal, peat, animal bones and other resources to build a medium-sized nitrogen fertilizer plant, a small bacterial fertilizer plant, and a bone meal plant each, and townships will also establish 77 small mixed fertilizer plants, with an annual output of more than 85,000 tons of various fertilizers. (4) Using local limestone as raw material, building a medium-sized cement plant, townships will build 20 small cement plants and 3 lime plants, with an annual output of 40,000 tons of cement by 1962; (5) Using lignite as raw material, building two small oil refineries with an annual output of 4,000 tons of tar. And build 8 pine root oil processing plants in townships, with an annual output of 3,600 tons of pine root oil. After reprocessing, it can be used as fuel for tractors. (6) On the basis of further clarifying the magnetic iron ore resources, develop small-scale smelting industry. (7) Expand the Shangzhi Agricultural Tool Repair Plant, and build 24 small repair plants in townships, and agricultural cooperatives generally establish a small blacksmith furnace each, so that by 1960, major repairs will be done in the county, minor repairs in the township, and maintenance in the cooperative. In addition, in order to adapt to the leap forward in agricultural and sideline production, the corresponding development of small agricultural and sideline product processing enterprises.

　　Within five years, forestry, animal husbandry, commerce, transportation, culture, education, and health undertakings will also have corresponding development. In this way, with agriculture, sideline occupations, and industry as the center, all aspects of work are strung together on one line, and then the backbone is grasped in each item, thereby promoting the high-speed and comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economic undertaking.

　　Mobilizing the Masses to Formulate and Implement Plans
　　In this planning process, we abandoned the past practice of relying only on a few cadres sitting in the office to check historical data, calculate numbers, and fill in forms, which was divorced from reality and the masses. Because doing so has great harm: (1) In the formulation of plans, it is often "seeing things but not people," looking back more and looking forward less, emphasizing the role of materials more and seeing the role of people less, resulting in plans that are conservative and less promoted. (2) Because the plan cannot fully reflect the actual needs, coupled with a set of cumbersome rules and regulations, it restricts the enthusiasm of the masses to build socialism. (3) Because the plan is not implemented and does not reflect the objective reality and the requirements of the masses, it loses its guiding role for the work. The masses said that the plan is: "Many indicators, few measures, many distant, few near, many said, few done, high ideals, low enthusiasm." These situations show that if we want the plan to truly play a promoting role, we must oppose subjectivism and replace it with the mass line.

　　After the County Party Committee disseminated the experience of comprehensive planning and comprehensive leap forward in Weihe Town, the trend of the whole party and the whole people engaging in planning quickly swept the county. According to preliminary statistics, more than 80,000 party members, cadres, activists, and educated masses participated in the planning work, and more than 16,000 opinions were put forward. After discussion, the plan was enriched and revised. Less than half a month after the on-site meeting, the draft plans of various townships and cooperatives have been formulated. In early April, the County Party Committee held another meeting of county and township cadres, and revised the county's planning indicators for the next five years: paddy fields increased from 35,000 hectares to 45,000 hectares; live pigs increased from 350,000 to 600,000; and 3 small hydropower stations, 3 gold mines, 2 small coal mines, 29 pine root oil plants, and 70 grass bag farms were added. After this meeting, the county's plan became more close to reality, and the thinking of the cadres became more open.

　　Practice has proved that adopting the above methods to formulate and implement plans has many advantages, the most important of which is: First, it can greatly inspire the initiative, creativity, and sense of responsibility of the masses. According to preliminary statistics, during this period, the masses contributed more than 20,000 suggestions in agricultural and sideline production, reported 15 mines in the development of industry, and provided 131 pieces of various machines. In order to accumulate funds for "tenizations", the masses automatically planted squash and vowed to buy "squash brand" tractors. In order to accumulate copper for production equipment, the masses automatically took out copper basins, copper pots, and other copper utensils. They said: "I participated in the formulation of the plan, and it is for our own sake. It is not okay if it is not implemented!" Second, it supplemented the shortcomings of the leadership and accelerated the speed of implementing the plan. Taking the establishment of a nest foundation factory as an example, we had not considered this matter originally. After the masses put forward their opinions, this project was added. In this way, it not only adapted to the needs of the large-scale development of beekeeping in the future, but also reduced the burden of the masses to purchase from other places. Third, it encouraged the masses. The masses generally reflected: "This time, socialism has a future." Fourth, it educated the cadres. Before the plan, many cadres believed in theory that the masses could create everything, but this concept was not strong enough. After planning, all cadres unanimously admitted that the masses are the source of strength and the treasure house of wisdom. We must rely on the masses and follow the mass line to do our work.

　　How to Balance the Plan?
　　In the process of formulating the plan, contradictions such as insufficient labor, insufficient funds, and unbalanced materials appeared. At that time, there were two opinions on how to solve these contradictions. One was: seeking various measures to make the backward catch up with the advanced and achieve balance; the other was: accommodating the backward, blindly reducing indicators, and achieving balance. If the balance is carried out according to the former opinion, various undertakings will be developed at a high speed; if the balance is carried out according to the latter opinion, it will hinder the development of various undertakings. Therefore, we adopted the former and denied the latter.

　　How did we solve these problems?

　　First, the methods to solve the labor shortage: (1) Tap all labor potential, give full play to the role of more than 10,000 male and female labor, stabilize the population inflow and control the population outflow over the years, and organize work-study programs, which can solve more than 4,000 labor. (2) After the realization of agricultural mechanization, it can replace more than 10,000 labor. (3) Vigorously promote labor cooperation between industry and agriculture, agricultural and sideline occupations, towns and villages, and fixed workers and temporary workers, which also solves the imbalance of labor use between seasons. (4) Appropriately increase the number of working days, and the male labor force will increase from 250 working days to 300. (5) Organize the floating idle population in market towns to go to the countryside and mountains, actively receive immigrants from other places, and settle these labor in areas with more land, more sideline occupations, and less population. When necessary, organize cooperation between townships and cooperatives, and appropriately allocate part of the labor to solve the imbalance between regions. (6) Actively improve various tools and labor organizations and improve labor efficiency.

　　Second, in terms of funds, according to various plans, a total of more than 60 million yuan will be invested in five years. Among them, relying on local finance to solve more than 33 million yuan, and the rest will be solved through cooperative accumulation and mass fundraising, and the balance result is still surplus. The sources of funds are: (1) Increase budget revenue. Mainly rely on expanding mass income. Where original enterprises have conditions, implement diversified operations and expand income. (2) Tighten budget expenditures. In line with the spirit of building the country diligently and frugally and running all enterprises and undertakings diligently and frugally, 1.5 million yuan of expenses have been compressed. (3) Clean up off-budget funds and stagnant materials, and dig out more than 1.3 million yuan. (4) Organize handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and grain departments to run industries, totaling more than 6 million yuan. (5) Launch mass fundraising. This year, special fundraising and long-term savings methods are adopted. In the future, it will be changed to selling local construction bonds. It is estimated that about 3 million yuan can be solved this year, and 990,000 yuan has been solved so far. (6) Expand the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives, which can reach more than 50 million yuan in five years. In addition to solving the funds needed for agricultural mechanization, it can also build water conservancy projects and run some industries in townships.

　　In terms of the use of funds, although the overall amount is enough, the first two years are the most tense. In order to overcome the difficulties in this regard, the following measures were taken during the balance: (1) Vigorously expand savings. (2) Reasonably review and allocate capital construction investment, so that non-productive buildings are simple and use old equipment and stagnant equipment to the fullest extent, and some projects that can be postponed are adjusted to ensure the most important and urgently needed projects. (3) Correctly verify the working capital.

　　Third, in terms of material balance, adhere to the principle of prioritizing the country and then the locality, and prioritizing the collective and then the small collective. For example, after prioritizing ensuring the country's needs for sugar beets, they are then supplied to county and township industries. The raw materials used by county and township industries are also given priority to meet the needs of the county before arranging the needs of townships accordingly.

　　Planning, Publicizing, and Acting Simultaneously
　　While formulating the plan, we implemented the principle of planning, publicizing, and acting simultaneously. For projects that are more confident, we immediately publicized and acted, did practical work, worked quickly, and worked hard. For some projects that are not very confident, such as resources whose reserves have not yet been clarified, we also began to act, clarified in practice, and then made revisions. This is not statically engaging in planning, but organically combining the formulation of plans with the implementation of plans.

　　The county plans to build 251 small factories this year, and 82 have already started construction or started design, and bacterial fertilizer plants, small coal mines, and small power stations have started production.

　　Now 185 cooperatives have established 293 bases such as reed ponds, orchards, fish ponds, beekeeping, silkworm breeding, and rabbit breeding. Supply and marketing departments have signed 225 contracts with agricultural cooperatives, with orders amounting to 570,000 yuan.

　　The prevention and treatment of Kashin-Beck disease and the renovation of rural houses have been rolled out in key townships and cooperatives. Simple rural bathhouses have been established in two cooperatives. Rural amateur middle schools have been opened in 19 places, and 92 amateur high schools and primary school night schools, 213 classes, and 21 attached classes have also been established. School started in mid-April, and 97% of school-age children in the county have enrolled.

　　The training of technical teams has already begun. In just 20 days, the technical team has grown from scratch to 309 people, including oil, wine, rice, sugar workers, electricians, carpenters, bricklayers, and specialized personnel in silkworm breeding, beekeeping, rabbit breeding, and fish farming. In addition, 152 cooperative members were sent to Mishan to learn how to drive tractors and use machinery. In order to strengthen the technical leadership of factory construction, the county organized 10 technical guidance groups, with a total of 28 technicians and cadres, to assist the factory construction work in various townships and cooperatives.

　　In short, planning and acting simultaneously not only ensure the implementation of the plan, but also test whether the plan itself is completely feasible, so that it is truly implemented. Doing so also corrected the attitude of some cadres and masses who lacked confidence in the plan and held a wait-and-see attitude.

　　Precisely because the plan is combined with action, it further educated the masses. The masses saw that the beautiful vision was gradually being realized, and they responded to the call of the Party with practical actions.

　　Jian’guo Cooperative in Mifeng Township had more than 60 households planning to move, but they did not move after this planning, and the enthusiasm for production also came. Many young women in townships such as Sanyang and Yabuli no longer plan to go to the city to find a partner, and the young lads are also at ease with production. In less than half a month in Changshou Township, the spring plowing of 740 hectares of paddy fields was completed by more than 70%. Gongnong Cooperative went out early and returned late for days in a row. Seeing that Gongnong Cooperative was full of enthusiasm, Sanhe Cooperative also mobilized the whole cooperative to catch up. The 261 hectares of old paddy fields in these two cooperatives were all plowed by April 10, more than 20 days faster than in previous years. Township health personnel went to the fields to serve production and the masses. Supply and marketing cooperatives opened early and closed late, delivering goods to the door. Carpenters from agricultural cooperatives carried tools to the fields to repair agricultural tools, and feeders went to the fields to feed livestock. Members of the Forest Cooperative worked hard for ten days and removed the 200 hectares of tree stumps that had not been solved for many years. The staff of Shangzhi Distillery actively produced, and the starch-to-alcohol rate increased from 48.5% to 71%, and the annual output of white wine can be increased by 55 tons.

　　The Key Lies in Strengthening the Party's Leadership
　　It can be said that in the planning process, there are ideological problems at every step. Before the mind was liberated, the thought of "leap forward conditions" was very common; after the issue of engaging in planning was raised, some people were afraid of affecting current production; when the issue of township-run industries was raised, some people were afraid of not doing well; after these problems were solved, there was a bias of unclear priorities in the content of the plan; in dealing with the relationship between the collective and the individual, the thought of inverting the priorities was expressed; after the upsurge of industry was launched, the thought of departmentalism of mutual control of material mobilization that was not smooth appeared. This situation shows that the process of formulating a plan is also a process of ideological struggle. The methods we used to solve these ideological problems are: (1) Summarize advanced experience, hold on-site meetings, and educate cadres and the masses with facts. (2) Carry out large-scale publicity and education work aimed at the ideological problems existing in various periods. Recently, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses, increase confidence, and overcome conservative thinking, the County Party Committee launched a publicity campaign month centered on "tenizations" throughout the county, which was very powerful. (3) Debate any problems encountered in the planning process, and conduct education on ideology anytime and anywhere. (4) In the face of difficulties, call on party members and cadres to take the lead. For example, on the issue of funds, we first started with mobilizing the organ cadres to take the lead, and the effect was very good.

　　It is impossible to develop agricultural production without the support of other departments. Especially under the situation of a great leap forward in agriculture, sideline occupations, and industry, it is even more important to strengthen cooperation between departments and regions. If it is done well, it will develop forward in harmony and rhythm; if it is not done well, there will be uncoordinated or even mutually restrictive phenomena between various economic departments, between industry and agriculture, and between cities and villages. Based on the practice of this period, the methods we adopted to solve these problems are: (1) Pay attention to overcoming departmentalism at any time, establish an overall view, and improve the understanding of cadres on the importance of cooperation. (2) Launch the relevant townships and towns to exchange what they have and do what they need on the basis of consultation. We solved many difficulties such as seeds and machinery equipment through this method. (3) Organize county-level directly affiliated units to link up with agricultural cooperatives to implement cooperation in terms of human and material resources. In particular, digging out stagnant equipment played a great role in supporting the countryside.

　　With the continuous emergence of various new undertakings, it is necessary to continuously improve the political and ideological awareness of cadres and quickly mobilize them to master this knowledge, so as to achieve both red and expert, and change from laymen to experts. The methods we have initially explored to solve this problem are: (1) We must implement the policy of building and learning at the same time; (2) Send cadres from departments with strong technical content to relevant units to study or organize them to visit outside. We have organized some cadres to go out to study specialized knowledge such as cement and chemical fertilizers; (3) Conscientiously promote the method of engaging in experimental fields, use the breakthrough point to guide the overall situation, and promote the red and expert cadres.

　　After comprehensive planning and a comprehensive leap forward, new problems in various aspects continue to emerge. Whether these problems are solved in a timely and reasonable manner will affect the realization of the entire plan, especially in the first one or two years of implementing the plan. Therefore, this requires the leadership to overcome one-sided views, single-handedness, and general leadership style. Establish a set of leadership methods adapted to the comprehensive leap forward. The County Party Committee has studied the new situation after the plan and determined to clarify the division of labor under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, strengthen the leadership of various fronts, and determine a secretary to regularly lead the planning work, and transfer a group of forces to enrich the leadership of various economic departments and weak departments. In order to realize the tenizations in a step-by-step manner, the County Party Committee also divided the work according to the planning project, requiring that typical models be cultivated in each aspect to guide the overall work.

　　From this comprehensive plan, we deeply feel that we should further strengthen the Party's leadership over planning work. Not only is it needed when formulating plans, but also when revising and enriching plans, organizing the implementation of plans, and inspecting the implementation of plans, it needs to be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party Committee. Grasping the plan is also a leadership method that can raise the key points and make everything clear. If it is used well, it can closely combine the central work with the work of various business departments, both centrally and comprehensively, which is conducive to realizing the comprehensive leadership of the Party Committee.

    编者按：我们的社会主义建设事业正在轰轰烈烈、蓬蓬勃勃地发展。一个县，这是一个重要的作战单位，只有从全局出发，结合当地的情况，进行全面的部署，把彼此密切联系的农业、工业、商业等各门经济事业和各项文化、教育事业全部抓起来，才能有利于作战，不致顾此失彼，或者失去重点。这种部署，就是全面规划。黑龙江尚志县在这方面提供了很好的经验。他们制订规划的方法，是充分地发动群众和依靠群众的马克思列宁主义的方法。因此，规划定得既先进又切实，既有中心又有全面。这样做的结果是：
    县级机关对各项建设工作的领导加强了，广大群众的生产、建设的积极性更加高涨了，各项建设事业的发展更快了。
    前一个时期，我们在省委和地委的帮助指导下，制订了社会主义建设的全面规划。五年内农业生产将由每垧产四千一百九十八斤提高到一万斤，工业生产产值由1957年的一千万元增长到一亿八千万元；副业生产由1957年的七百万元增长到四千三百万元，五年内将先后实现农田水利化、农业机械化、施肥化肥化、农村电力化、乡镇工业化、交通进代化、荒山四旁绿化、教育普及化、生活卫生化、房屋砖瓦化。由于采取了边规划边行动的方法，现在已经进行设计、兴建、投入生产的中、小型工厂有九十八个，已经有一百八十五个农业社建立了苇塘、果园、养兔、养蜂、养蚕、鱼塘等副业生产基地二百九十三处，仅二十五天群众集资已达九十九万元。
    一个长期没有解决的问题
    我县是一个“八山一水一分田”的富饶山区。不仅发展农业的潜力很大，而且山间、林间蕴藏着丰富的土、副、特产与矿产资源。正像群众所说：“天上飞的，山上长的，林间跑的，水里游的，地下埋的，没有不出钱的地方”。但是，由于我们对山区生产的特点认识不够，对组织发展多部门经济缺乏经验，几年来农业与多种经营之间在劳力、资金、时间等方面，经常发生尖锐的矛盾。不少社常常抓住一面丢掉一面，不能全面增产，更快的增加收入。有些社抓了副业而忽视农业这个中心环节，结果副业增产了，农业没增产。多数社只抓农业而忽视了多种经营，结果虽然农业年年有所增产，但副业收入逐年减少。正由于这种情况，山间许多珍贵的山产、特产资源被大量损失浪费，不能合理利用。我们对全县几项主要品种进行了调查：山参历史上最高年产量为一千五百两，而1957年只生产二百七十两；元皮最高生产量为一万张，1956年只生产五百张，木耳最高年产量十万斤，1957年只收一百斤。由于产量减少，自食不足，还从关里进口木耳一千五百多斤。所以群众不满的说：“住在宝中宝，副业没搞好，一年不着闲，没挣多少钱”。由于这种情况，合作社与社员之间，农业社与其他经济部门之间也常发生矛盾。如有些社对社员经营副业管理得过死，合作社又不去积极经营，结果给单干户造成了大量经营的便利条件，不少单干户乘机大发其财，不少社员要求出社单干或者撩下社的生产外出经营副业，严重影响了合作社的巩固。另方面由于山产、土、特产产量减少，又使某些地方工业生产受到一些影响。如一面坡葡萄酒厂去年计划收购葡萄一千吨，结果只收到三百九十五吨，产值减少一百二十六万元。对手工业、供销部门以及城市供应等方面的影响也是很大的。
    去秋以来，经过整风与社会主义大辩论，我县群众的社会主义觉悟与生产积极性空前高涨，出现了一个空前的生产大跃进的新形势。县委在上级党的启发与这个形势的推动下，提出了全县在一年内实现全国农业发展纲要亩产四百斤的要求。由于这个要求反映了广大群众的愿望，因而任务提出后，得到了广大农民的热烈响应。他们打破了历史陈规，在冰天雪地里修水库、送粪肥，几乎所有的男女全部卷入了这个农业生产大跃进的高潮，一冬完成了水利工程一百六十二处，积粪肥二百万立方公尺。但是正由于这种情况，农业的用工量约比去年增加50％，农业与多种经营之间的矛盾更加尖锐了，许多农业社只抓农业不抓副业，甚至企图把已在从事副业的劳畜力抽回来投入水利、粪肥运动，再加上有些社的领导上单纯为了实现亩产四百斤，多种高产作物，想减少大豆及其他经济作物。在送粪等措施上又偏重于苞米、水稻等高产作物上使劲，忽视了全面增产。
    今年2月，省委提出了苦战三年，七年实现农业发展纲要四十条的号召，不仅进一步要求搞好多种经营，而且要求地方工业和其他各项事业紧紧跟上农业的大跃进。于是，这个长期没有解决的问题被提到更重要的位置上来了。
    找到了解决问题的钥匙
    为了解决这个问题，县委曾采取过不少措施。但是，农业与多种经营之间的矛盾始终没有从根本上解决。直到今年，苇河镇创造的
  “依靠群众、有中心、有骨干、全面规划、全面跃进”的先进经验启发了我们，使我们找到了一把解决问题的钥匙。苇河镇的经验主要是：
    第一、广泛发动群众参加制订规划：克服了在制订规划中“见物不见人”的偏向，开阔了领导思想。第二、既有全面综合的规划，又有中心有骨干，以农业、副业、工业为中心把各方面的工作都串在一条线上，达到互相推动全面跃进的目的。第三、边规划边宣传边行动，纠正了静止地制订规划的偏向；因此不仅使规划落实了，而且成了推动当前工作的动力。
    3月23日，我们在苇河镇召开了各乡、镇全面规划的现场会议，介绍了苇河的经验。通过这次会议，不仅明确了规划的主要内容和应当采取的方法，而且解除了怕搞规划影响当前农业生产的顾虑。苇河会议之后，各乡、镇普遍开展了规划工作。为了加强对全面规划工作和当前生产的领导，县委一方面组织人员下乡检查备耕，指导各乡、社的规划工作。另一方面就立即着手进行全县的全面规划。县委分工由一个书记一个县长为首，同时组织抽调了十七个部、局、科级干部和六十一个业务人员，在省的帮助下，共分为十二个规划小组（农业、副业、畜牧业、林业、工业、邮电、交通、商业、财政金融、劳动人口、文教、卫生、政法），一个综合组，同时分别进行规划。为密切配合和推动当前工作，并在全部规划工作的过程中，坚持了边规划边行动的办法，并且在每次研究规划问题的会议上，同时也结合研究处理当前备耕、除四害、扫盲等项工作问题。各分工包片领导备耕工作的负责人也同时担负检查推动乡、社的规划工作之责，这样就避免了规划与当前生产脱节现象。
    有中心、有骨干、全面规划、全面跃进
    在苇河镇全面大跃进的启发下，县、乡干部思想都豁然开朗。苇河镇会议为全面规划、全面跃进打下了一个良好的思想基础。但是另一方面也有些部门和干部存在着主次不清、急缓不分和中心骨干不明等现象。如卫生工作方面，规划建立产科医院，而对严重危害我县人民身体健康影响生产的大骨节病则没有注意；文化教育方面要求投资五万元建立职业剧团，不根据需要提出建立一座工业专业学校等。因此，明确中心和骨干就成为规划当中必须解决的根本问题了。在解决这个问题上，我们采取的办法是：引导干部具体分析我县生产特点，生产与生活，需要与可能及急与缓的关系，并特别着重研究了国民经济发展的规律，从而明确了中心与全面、骨干与一般之间的关系。经过分析研究，根据我县农业生产潜力大，土、副、特产资源丰富等特点，确定我们以发展农业、副业、地方工业为中心；而在这三项之中又以农业为轴心。
    第一、关于农业：全县现有耕地面积六万七千公顷，规划到1962年达到七万五千公顷，公顷产量1958年达到六千斤，1962年达到一万斤。为了实现这个指标所采取的骨干措施是：
  （1）三年实现水利化。全县有大小河流十七条，泡沼一百二十个，年降雨量七百公厘左右，总径流量十九亿公方左右，适于兴修水利，发展稻田。我们根据这一有利条件，稻田播种面积由1957年九千公顷，到1962年扩大到四万五千公顷，占总耕地面积的60％。（2）三年实现耕作机械化。根据现在马、牛、机结合与将来机、牛、马结合的原则，除抓紧工具改革以外，我们初步计划需要中型机车一百台，小型机车一百九十台，手扶式一千六百台以及相应的农机具。实现这个规划，不仅解决了由于发展水田带来劳力不足的矛盾，可以做到深耕细作，适时播种，增加产量，而且还可以腾出劳力去从事多种经营。（3）三年内实现施肥化肥化。到1962年每公顷地粪肥达五万斤以上，还可增施化肥四百斤（水田可达到六百斤）。
    第二、关于副业：我县副产品特别丰富，盛产山葡萄、草梅、蛤蟆、元磨、木耳、五味子、人参、鹿茸等各种野生动、植物不下二百多种。经过规划，全县副业生产总值1958年达到一千四百二十五万元，1962年达到四千五百万元。实现这个规划的骨干措施有三：（1）
  “采、养、捕、栽”四结合。（2）扩大集体经营范围，适当缩小个人经营比例；（3）加强土、特产品收购工作。
    第三、关于工业：我县矿藏十分丰富，据初步掌握的资料，即有煤、金、铜、铁、石灰石、大理石、云母、石墨、磷灰土等十五种。还有许多河流宜于水力发电，而且山产、土特产可供大力发展工业。我们计划五年内兴建中小型工业和作坊七百零二个，到1962年工业总产值达到一亿八千万元，比1957年增长十六倍。为实现上述指标，在二年内，建立起七个工业系统——“七条龙”即：（1）以水能为主，兴建火力、水力、沼气发电站二百六十八处，到1962年电能容量可达五千七百八十瓩。（2）在凤山、丁山、乌吉密等地开采小煤窑三处，到1962年年产煤二十五万吨。（3）利用当地原煤、草炭、兽骨等资源新建中型氮肥厂、小型菌肥厂、骨粉厂各一处，乡镇还分别建立小型混合肥料厂七十七处，年产各种肥料可达八万五千吨以上。（4）利用当地石灰石作原料，兴建中型水泥厂一处，乡镇建小型水泥厂二十处，石灰厂三处，到1962年年产水泥四万吨；（5）利用褐煤作原料，建立小型炼油厂两处，年产焦油四千吨。并在乡镇兴建松根油加工厂八处，年产松根油三千六百吨。经再加工后可供拖拉机作燃料。（6）在进一步查清磁铁矿石资源的基础上，发展小型冶炼工业。（7）扩大尚志农具修配厂，并在乡、镇兴建小型修理厂二十四处，农业社普遍建立小铁匠炉各一处，到1960年做到大修在县，小修在乡，保养在社。此外，为适应农副业生产大跃进，相应的发展小型农副产品加工企业。
    五年内，林业、畜牧业、商业、交通运输、文教卫生事业等也要有相应的发展。这样以农、副、工为中心，把各方面工作都串在一条线上，再在每项中抓住骨干，从而可以促进整个国民经济事业高速度的全面跃进。
    发动群众制订和实现规划
    在这次规划过程中，我们摒弃了过去只靠少数干部坐在办公室里查历史资料，算数字，填表格的脱离实际、脱离群众的做法。因为那样做的害处很大：（1）在制订规划中常是“见物不见人”，向后看的多，向前看的少，强调物资作用多，看到人的作用少，结果制订出的规划是保守的多促进的少。（2）由于规划不能充分反映实际需要，加之有一套繁琐的规章制度，结果束缚了群众建设社会主义的积极性。（3）由于规划不落实，没有反映出客观实际和群众要求，所以失去了对工作的指导作用。群众说规划是：“指标多，措施少，远的多，近的少，说的多，做的少，理想高，干劲小。”这些情况表明，要想使规划真正起促进作用，就必须反掉主观主义，而代之以群众路线。
    县委传播了苇河镇全面规划全面跃进的经验以后，全党全民搞规划之风迅速地席卷全县。据初步统计，参加规划工作的党、团员干部、积极分子和受到教育的群众有八万余人，提出了一万六千多条意见。经过讨论后，充实和修改了规划。现场会议之后，不到半个月，各乡、社的规划草稿即已制定出来。4月上旬，县委又召开了县、乡干部会议，修订了今后五年县的规划指标：水田由三万五千公顷增加到四万五千公顷；生猪由三十五万口增加到六十万口；增加小型水力发电站三处，金矿三处，小煤矿二处，松根油厂二十九处，草袋场七十处。经过这次会议，县的规划更加接近实际，干部的思想也更加开阔了。
    实践证明，采取上述方式制订和执行规划好处很多，最重要的是：第一，可以大大启发群众的主动性、创造性和主人翁的责任感。据初步统计，这个时期群众在农副业生产方面献计达两万余条，在发展工业方面，报矿十五处，提供各种机器一百三十一台件。为了积累“十化”的资金，群众自动种角瓜，立志要买“角瓜牌”拖拉机。搞生产设备用铜，群众便自动把铜盆、铜壶等等铜器皿拿出来。他们说：规划是我参加制订的，而且是为了我们自己的，若不叫它实现那行呢！”第二，补充了领导上的不足，加快了执行规划的速度。以建立巢础厂为例，这件事情我们原来就没有考虑到，经过群众提出意见后，才加上了这个项目。这样一来，不仅适应了今后大量发展养蜂业的需要，而且也减少了群众到外地购买的许多负担。第三，鼓舞了群众。群众普遍反映说：“这回社会主义可有奔头了”。第四，教育了干部。在规划前，许多干部虽在理论上相信群众能够创造一切，但这种观念不够牢固。经过规划，所有干部一致承认群众是力量的源泉，是智慧的宝库。做工作必须依靠群众，走群众路线。
    规划如何平衡？
    在制定规划过程中，曾出现了劳力不足、资金不够、物资不平衡等矛盾。当时对解决这些矛盾的方法有两种主张，一种是：寻求各种措施，使落后赶上先进，求得平衡；另一种是：迁就落后，一味削减指标，求得平衡。按前一种主张进行平衡，各项事业就会得到高速度的发展；照后一种主张进行平衡，就会阻碍各项事业的发展。因此，我们采取了前一种，否定了后一种。
    对这些问题我们是怎样解决的呢？
    一、解决劳力不足的办法：（一）挖掘一切劳动潜力，充分发挥万余男女劳动力的作用，稳定历年流入人口和控制流出人口，以及组织勤工俭学等，共可解决四千多劳力。（二）实现农业机械化之后，可代替一万余个劳力。（三）大力推行工农业、农副业，城镇与乡村，固定工与临时工之间的劳力协作，亦农亦工亦副，这样就解决了季节间用工不平衡现象。（四）适当增加劳动日数，男劳动力由二百五十个劳动日提高到三百个。（五）组织集镇浮闲人口下乡上山，积极接收外地移民，把这些劳力安置到地多、副业多、人口少的地区，必要时组织乡社间的协作，适当调配部分劳力以解决地区间的不平衡。（六）积极改善各种工具及劳动组织，提高劳动效率。
    二、在资金方面根据各项规划，五年共需投资六千多万元。其中依靠地方财政解决三千三百多万元，其余全部通过合作社积累与群众集资解决，平衡结果还有余。资金来源有：（一）增加预算收入。主要依靠扩大群众收入。原有企业有条件的，实行多种经营，扩大收入。（二）紧缩预算支出。本着勤俭建国，勤俭办一切企业、事业的精神，压缩了一百五十多万元的开支。（三）清理预算外的资金和呆滞物资，挖掘出一百三十多万元。（四）组织手工业社、供销社、粮食部门兴办工业，共达六百多万元。（五）发动群众集资。今年是采取专项集资及长期储蓄方式。今后将改为推销地方建设公债的方式。预计今年约可解决三百万元左右，目前已解决九十九万元。（六）扩大农业生产合作社的公共积累，五年可达五千余万元，除解决农业机械化所需资金以外，还可兴办水利工程及在乡镇办一些工业。
    在资金使用上，虽然总的够用，但头两年最紧张。为了克服这方面的困难，平衡时采取了：（1）大力扩大储蓄。（2）合理审核和分配基建投资，使非生产性建筑因陋就简，充分运用旧设备和呆滞设备，调整了一些可以推迟建设的项目，以保证最主要的和急需的项目。（3）正确核定流动资金。
    三、在物资平衡方面，本着先国家后地方和先大公后小公的原则，如甜菜在优先保证国家需要后，再供给县、乡工业。只是县、乡工业用的原料，也先行满足县的需要后再相适应的安排乡镇的需要。
  边规划、边宣传、边行动
    在制订规划的同时，我们就贯彻执行了边规划、边宣传、边行动的原则，对于较有把握的项目立即宣传、行动，实干、快干、猛干。对于有些无大把握的，例如资源藏量还未查清的，也开始行动，在实践中澄清，再做修改。这就不是静止的搞规划，而是把制订规划与执行规划有机地结合起来了。
    全县今年规划建设二百五十一处小型工厂，现在已动工或着手设计的有八十二处，菌肥厂、小煤矿、小型电站已开始生产。
    现在已有一百八十五个社，建立苇塘、果园、鱼塘、养蜂、养蚕、养兔等基地二百九十三处。供销部门已和农业社签订合同二百二十五起，订购款额达五十七万元。
    防治大骨节病与农村房舍改建等工作，已在重点乡社铺开。已经在两个社建立起农村简易浴池。农村业余中学已经开办起十九处，还建立业余高小与小学夜校九十二处，二百一十三个班，二十一个附设班。4月中旬开学，全县适龄儿童已有97％入了学。
    技术队伍的培养工作已经开始。仅二十天中就从无到有壮大起技术队伍三百零九名，其中有油、酒、米、糖工人和电工、木工、瓦工和养蚕、养蜂、养兔、养鱼等专长人员。除此，还派了一百五十二名社员到密山学习驾驶拖拉机与使用机具。为了加强对建厂的技术领导，县组织十个技术指导组，共二十八名技工与干部，分别到各乡社协助建厂工作。
    总之，边规划、边行动，既保证了规划的实施，也考验了规划本身是否完全可行，使之真正落实。这样做也纠正了某些干部和群众对于规划缺乏信心抱有观望和怀疑的态度。
    正由于规划结合了行动，就进一步教育了群众，群众看到美好的远景在逐步实现，纷纷以实际行动响应党的号召。
    蜜蜂乡建国社曾有六十多户打算搬家，这次规划后不搬了，生产劲头也来了。三阳、亚布力等乡不少青年妇女再不打算进城找对象了，年青小伙子也安心生产了。长寿乡不到半个月时间，稻田春翻七百四十垧就完成了70％以上。工农社一连多少天早出晚归。三合社看工农社干劲十足，也全社动员迎头赶上，这两个社二百六十一垧老稻田，到4月10日就全部翻完，比往年加快二十多天。乡卫生人员下田间为生产为群众服务。供销社早开晚闭，送货到门。农业社木工背着工具下田间修理农具，饲养员下田间喂牲口。森林社社员苦干十天，把多少年来未解决的二百垧树槎地拔掉了。尚志制酒厂的职工积极生产，淀粉出酒率由48.5％提高到71％，全年可增产五十五吨白酒。
    关键在于加强党的领导
    在规划过程中，可以说是步步事事都有思想问题。在思想没有解放之前，“跃进条件论”的思想就很普遍；提出搞规划问题之后，又有些人怕影响当前生产；提出乡镇办工业问题，又有人怕搞不好；这些问题解决之后，在规划内容上，又出现了主次不分的偏向；在处理集体与个人关系上，则表现了本末倒置的思想；当工业的高潮掀起之后，又出现了互相控制物资调动不灵的本位主义思想。这种情况表明，制定规划过程，同时也是一场思想斗争过程。我们解决这些思想问题的方法是：（1）总结先进经验，召开现场会议，用事实教育干部和群众。（2）针对各个时期存在的思想问题，展开大规模的宣传教育工作。最近县委为了鼓舞群众干劲，增加信心，克服保守思想，在全县范围内，搞了一个以“十化”为中心内容的宣传运动月，声势很大。（3）在规划过程中，遇到什么问题辩论什么问题，随时随地针对思想进行教育。（4）在困难面前，号召党团员干部带头，如在资金问题上，我们首先从发动机关干部带头作起，效果很好。
    发展农业生产，离开其他部门的支援是不行的。特别是在农、副、工业大跃进的形势下，加强各部门各地区之间的协作就更为重要了。搞得好，就会合拍合节地向前发展，搞不好，在各个经济部门之间，在工业与农业之间，城市与乡村之间，就会发生不协调甚至互相掣肘的现象。根据这个时期的实践，我们解决这些问题采取的方法是：（1）随时注意克服本位主义思想，树立全局观点，提高干部对协作的重要意义的认识。（2）发动有关乡、镇在协商的基础上互通有无，我们通过这种办法解决了不少籽种、机械设备等困难。（3）组织县直属各单位与农业社挂钩，实行人力物力方面的协作。特别是挖掘呆滞器材对支援农村起了很大作用。
    随着各项新的事业不断出现，必须在不断提高干部的政治思想觉悟的同时，迅速发动他们掌握这些知识，以便做到又红又专，由外行变成内行。解决这个问题，我们初步摸索的办法是：（1）必须贯彻边建设边学习的方针；（2）把技术性较强的部门的干部送到有关单位去学习或组织外出参观。我们已组织了部分干部外出学习水泥、化肥等专门知识；（3）认真推广搞试验田的办法，以突破的一点指导全面，并促进干部红与专。
    全面规划全面跃进之后，各方面新的问题不断出现，这些问题解决得是否及时、合理，都影响整个规划的实现，特别是在执行规划的头一、二年尤其重要。因此，这就要求领导上必须克服片面观点、单打一和一般化的领导作风。建立一套与全面跃进相适应的领导方法。县委已经对规划以后的新情况作了研究，确定在党委统一领导下明确分工，强化各个战线的领导，并确定一名书记经常领导规划工作，又抽调了一批力量充实各个经济部门与薄弱部门的领导力量。为了有步骤地实现十化，县委又根据规划项目进行分工，要求在每一方面都先行培养典型作出样子以指导全面工作。
    从此次全面规划中，我们深切感到应进一步加强党对计划工作的领导。不仅在制订规划时需要，而且在修订充实规划，组织实现规划，以及检查执行规划时，都需要在党委统一领导下来进行。抓规划，这也是一种纲举目张的领导方法，运用得好，可将中心工作与各业务部门的工作紧密结合起来，既有中心又全面，有利于实现党委的全面领导。
