    Absorbing Mass Experience, Constantly Enriching Himself
    Li Shimei Resolves to Study Diligently and Continue to Improve

    (Our Correspondent He Xing reports) Renowned termite expert Li Shimei arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Hangzhou on the 21st. When talking to reporters about his impressions of this trip, he said that the support and encouragement given to him by party and government leaders and scientists in various places had deeply educated him. After returning to Guangzhou, he will strive to participate in the work of eliminating termites in Guangzhou and return all his technical experience to the people. He said that he had also learned a lot of new knowledge during his travels to various places. For example, the types and activities of termites in various places are different from what he had previously grasped in Guangdong, and the prevention and control methods are also different. Therefore, he believes that he should humbly learn and continue to work hard to improve himself in the future.
    After Li Shimei was invited to Beijing by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Special Learned Societies in mid-May, he was accepted as a member of the Entomological Society of China. He held several symposiums with scientists in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. During his stay in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, Li Shimei also worked with entomologists and termite extermination workers to give on-site demonstrations and impart termite extermination techniques. In Hangzhou, he was responsible for training more than 500 termite extermination personnel. Under Li Shimei's guidance, they found 358 termite nests in just two days. The termite extermination personnel in Shanghai have also initially learned the technique of finding termite main nests based on Li Shimei's advanced experience. Now these areas are actively carrying out termite extermination work based on the experience introduced and taught by Li Shimei.

    吸取群众经验  不断充实自己
    李始美决心努力学习继续提高
    本报讯  记者河星报道：著名白蚁专家李始美21日由杭州乘飞机返抵广州。他对记者谈起他此行的观感时说：各地党政领导人员和科学家们给他的支持和鼓励，使他受到深刻的教育。回到广州后，他将努力参加广州消灭白蚁的工作，把自己的全部技术经验还给人民。他说，这回到各地去也学到了许多新的知识。例如各地的白蚁种类和活动情况，就和他过去在广东所掌握的有差别，防治方法也有不同之处。因此，他认为自己今后要虚心学习，继续努力提高自己。
    李始美自5月中旬应中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会邀请到北京后，就被接受为中国昆虫学会会员。他先后同北京、上海、南京和杭州等地的科学家举行了多次座谈会。在上海、南京和杭州期间，李始美还同昆虫学家和消灭白蚁工作人员一起，作了现场表演，传授消灭白蚁的技术。在杭州时，他负责训练了五百多个消灭白蚁人员，在李始美的指导下，他们仅在两天内就找到了三百五十八个白蚁巢。上海的消灭白蚁人员根据李始美的先进经验，也初步学会了找寻白蚁主巢的技术。现在这些地区正根据李始美介绍传授的经验，积极开展消灭白蚁工作。
