Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, June 26th: In Shijiazhuang City, nearly ten thousand housewives have participated in industrial construction in the past twenty-odd days, establishing 1,427 small street factories throughout the city.

In the great leap forward in industrial production, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to establish more than four thousand small street factories this year to meet the needs of increased production in large industries. However, there is a severe shortage of labor. The thirty-odd municipal factories built this year alone are short of 30,000 workers, making the establishment of street factories even more challenging. The potential of the labor force among housewives in Shijiazhuang is substantial, with over 20,000 young and middle-aged women among the families of employees. To mobilize this workforce to actively participate in industrial construction, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted in-depth propaganda and education on the general line of socialist construction among housewives throughout the city. Many housewives took off their aprons, stepped out of their homes, and actively networked with each other to establish various small factories. As of the 23rd, over 90% of the workers in the 1,427 small factories established throughout the city were housewives. These factories can produce not only paper and yarn but also products from technically complex and physically demanding fields such as sand casting, copper casting, wire drawing, coke refining, and electromechanical repair. The Shijiazhuang Water Pump Factory has a large production task this year and needs small factories to assist in processing some small sand-cast parts, but no processing factories could be found. The family members of the factory's employees then established a small sand-casting factory with a daily output of over 400 kilograms, specializing in casting small castings for the water pump factory. The "March 8th" Women's Sand Casting Factory has more than twenty female workers whose husbands are workers at the water pump factory. They adopted the method of learning what their husbands do, starting with practical operations, gradually improving from simple to complex. They signed husband-and-wife apprenticeship contracts, sometimes studying techniques until late at night without rest. As a result, in just over ten days, they learned techniques such as iron melting, pouring, and sand mold making. By the 23rd, they had cast over a thousand water pump parts for the water pump factory, without producing a single reject.

    家庭妇女踊跃参加工业建设
    石家庄办起千余小型街道工厂
    据新华社石家庄26日电　石家庄市的家庭妇女，在最近的二十多天中有近万人参加工业建设，在全市办起了一千四百二十七家小型街道工厂。
    在工业生产大跃进中，中共石家庄市委计划今年举办四千多座小型街道工厂，来满足大工业增产的需要。但是劳动力很缺乏，全市只今年兴建的三十多座市营工厂就缺三万名工人，要办街道工厂就更感劳动力不足了。石家庄市家庭妇女中劳动力的潜力却很大，仅在职工家属中就有二万多名青壮年妇女。为了动员这批劳动力积极参加工业建设，中共石家庄市委在全市家庭妇女中深入地展开了社会主义建设总路线的宣传教育。许多家庭妇女脱掉围裙，走出家庭，互相串连，积极兴办各种小型工厂。到23日止，全市已建立起来的一千四百二十七座小型工厂中，90％以上的工人都是家庭妇女。这些工厂不仅能生产纸张、毛线等，而且能生产技术比较复杂、体力劳动较强的翻砂、铸铜、拔丝、炼焦机电修配等方面的产品。石家庄水泵厂今年生产任务很大，需要小厂协助加工一部分小型翻砂零件，但是找不到加工厂。这个厂的职工家属就办起了一座日产四百多公斤的小翻砂厂，专门为水泵厂铸造小铸件。“三八”妇女翻砂厂有二十多个女工的丈夫是水泵厂的工人，她们采取丈夫做什么自己学什么，先从实际操作学起，由简到繁逐步提高的办法，和丈夫订立了夫妇师徒合同，有时学习技术直到深夜还不休息。结果，只十多天时间，她们就学会了化铁、浇注、制砂模等技术，到23日，已给水泵厂铸造了一千多件水泵零件，没有出过一个废品。
