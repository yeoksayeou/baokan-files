　　The Most Sublime, Most Glorious, and Most Lovable
　　Qian Junrui
    Our great motherland is now creating great miracles every moment. The performance by the spare-time performance team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Convalescent Home is such an outstanding miracle. Is there anything in the world more moving and inspiring than this? They are the most sublime, most glorious, and most lovable art created by the most sublime, most glorious, and most lovable people of our country. The Chinese people feel the greatest pride in having such people. Our socialist new culture feels immense glory in having such creations and performances.
    What kind of people are they? Comrade Zhang Jiachen, a first-class disabled revolutionary soldier with both wrists amputated and a third-class meritorious soldier in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, recited a poem "Our Hearts Are Forever Loyal to the Party" written by Comrade Liu Yusheng, a specially disabled revolutionary soldier with lower limb paralysis. He told us:
    We are the sons and daughters of the motherland,
    We are the soldiers of Mao Zedong,
    On the battlefield, we used bayonets to split the enemy,
    Even disabled, we are still fearless soldiers.
    Our blood boils like the tide,
    Our energy is as vigorous as pines and cypresses,
    Loving the motherland and hating the enemy is our personality,
    Conquering difficulties is our unique talent. Look, how heroic! How bold! How strong! How clear-cut in love and hatred! How loyal to the motherland and the people! They possess a typical communist style. Fighting for truth, fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people, is their bounden duty. Comrade Liu Yusheng also told us:
    We have a strong will,
    We have a heart that will never be disabled.
    We can read newspapers and books without eyes,
    We can write and play the piano without hands,
    Paralyzed legs can use hands to work,
    We can walk and run quickly without feet.
    Difficulties only exist in front of the weak,
    They cannot stop well-trained soldiers!
    The Chinese people have stood up, standing tall and firm, and becoming masters. The slavish appearance of Jia Gui is gone. Even the weak have straightened their backs. In this way, in front of us, high mountains cannot but bow their heads, and rivers cannot but give way. The word "difficulty" will truly disappear from our dictionary.
    In the minds and creations of such a group of true people, the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is embodied. They have bright and far-reaching ideals. They sing:
    The Communist Party is good, good, good,
    Leading the motherland in great construction,
    Socialism is so beautiful! They recite:
    As long as our hearts are still beating,
    We will resolutely fight for communism!
    Their revolutionary spirit is twisted into a rope with their down-to-earth hard work:
    We are unwilling to make boundless fantasies,
    We know how to arrange our own lives,
    The socialist mansion certainly needs steel,
    But we are willing to be a small screw. This group of heroes of the motherland centrally embodies the revolutionary optimism of our working people. Listen to Du Shuangquan's (a first-class disabled revolutionary soldier with his right hand and right foot amputated, a second-class meritorious soldier) clapper talk:
    Comrades, heroes,
    Although wounded, we are also optimistic,
    Comrades without feet learn to dance,
    Paralyzed comrades are singing,
    Blind comrades are playing the huqin,
    Comrades without hands are telling stories,
    Some comrades are rehearsing plays,
    Some are learning to play the Sichuan opera gong,
    Dong bu nong dong zhuang chou zhuang,
    Everyone is happy,
    I, Du Shuangquan, am also learning clapper talk,
    And some comrades are telling cross-talk,
    One hand can play the xiao and flute,
    Pressing the harmonium without hands is also pretty good. While carrying out literary and artistic activities, they also participate in various labor productions suitable for their bodies. For example, paralyzed comrades Fan Deyou and Li Zhenghua learned to assemble crystal sets and radios, and Chen Shaokang, who had his lower limbs amputated, and paralyzed Zhou Shaozong learned to repair tricycles and shoes. Some learned to knit, sew, and embroider, and some participated in growing vegetables and raising pigs. They all said, "Our bodies are disabled, but our will is not. We are revolutionary optimists, and we want to be promoters of socialism." Ask them why they are so optimistic? Du Shuangquan will tell you:
    Why are comrades optimistic?
    All because the Communist Party leads well. Liu Yusheng will tell you:
    The fate of the motherland is our fate,
    Our hearts are linked to the motherland.
    Socialism is our soul,
    The Party is the mother who nurtures us to grow. The revolutionary optimism of the Sichuan honorary soldiers represents the unlimited vitality of our liberated social productive forces. It will destroy all the stagnant atmosphere and corrupt garbage, and will be invincible.
    The literary and artistic creations of the honorary soldiers are the most sublime and most respectable art in our socialist cultural garden. It is simple, clear, strong, and forthright, and it has endless attraction. Anyone who wants to participate in the great cause of creating a new national culture of socialism should bow their heads and listen attentively to learn from them, learn their irresistible communist style, learn their revolutionary optimism, and learn their revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism combined with literary and artistic creations that are loved by the working people.
    Those greatest creations and greatest writers and artists who will undoubtedly surpass the slave-owner era, feudal era, and capitalist world by dozens or hundreds of times will undoubtedly come from among these most ordinary people.
    Most respectable and most lovable soldiers, I sing your praises, with laughter and uncontrollable tears of pride.

### 最崇高、最光荣和最可爱的

　　最崇高、最光荣和最可爱的
　　钱俊瑞
    我们伟大的祖国现在正每时每刻出现着伟大的奇迹。四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队的演出就是这样一个非常突出的奇迹。世界上还有比这更能感动人激励人的存在么？它们是我们国家的最崇高、最光荣和最可爱的人们所创作出来的最崇高、最光荣最可爱的文艺。中国人民因为有了这样的人们而感到最大的骄傲。我国的社会主义新文化因为有了这样的创作和演出而感到莫大的光荣。
    他们究竟是何等样的人？一位断了双腕的一等残废革命军人，抗美援朝中的三等功臣张家琛同志朗诵了另一位下肢瘫痪的特等残废革命军人刘渝生同志所创作的一首诗“我们的心永远忠于党”，他告诉我们：
    我们是祖国的儿女，
    我们是毛泽东的战士，
    战场上我们用刺刀劈过敌人，
    残废了，我们还是无畏的士兵。
    我们的热血像海涛一样沸腾，
    我们的精力像松柏永远旺盛，
    爱祖国恨敌人是我们的个性，
    征服困难是特有的才能。看，多么英勇！多么豪迈！多么坚强！多么爱憎分明！多么忠诚于祖国和人民！他们具有典型的共产主义风格。为真理而战斗，为祖国和人民的利益而战斗，就是他们的天职。刘渝生同志还告诉我们：
    我们有坚强的意志，
    我们有颗永不残废的心。
    没有眼睛照样读书看报，
    没有双手一样写字弹琴，
    两腿瘫痪能用双手劳动，
    没有双脚也能疾走飞奔。
    困难只能在软弱者面前存在，
    挡不住久经锻炼的士兵！
    中国人民已经站起来了，顶天立地，做主人了。贾桂那样的奴隶相没有了。软弱者也挺起腰杆了。这样，在我们面前，高山就不能不低头，河水就不能不让路。“困难”两个字才真正要从我们的字典中消失。
    在这样一群真正的人的思想里和创作中，体现出革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义的结合。他们有光明远大的理想。他们唱着：
    共产党，好好好，
    领导祖国大建设，
    社会主义多美好！他们朗诵着：
    只要我们心脏还在跳动，
    就坚决为共产主义而斗争！
    他们的这种革命气概又和他们踏踏实实的干劲拧成了一根绳：
    我们不愿作无边际的幻想，
    我们懂得怎样安排自己的一生，
    社会主义大厦固然需要钢材，
    我们却愿意作颗小小的螺丝钉。这批祖国的英雄集中地体现出我国劳动人民的革命乐观主义。你听杜双全（右手右足切去的一等残废革命军人，二等功臣）的快板：
    同志们，英雄汉，
    虽然负伤也乐观，
    无脚的同志学跳舞，
    瘫痪的同志在唱歌，
    盲人同志拉胡琴，
    无手的同志讲小说，
    有的同志排演戏，
    有的学打川剧锣，
    咚不弄咚壮丑壮，
    打得大家都快乐，
    我杜双全又在学快板，
    还有的同志把相声说，
    独手能把箫笛奏，
    无手按风琴还挺不错。他们一面开展文艺活动，一面参加各种适合于他们身体的劳动生产。像瘫痪范德友、李正华等同志学会了装配矿石机和收音机，截去下肢的陈绍康、瘫痪周绍宗等同志学会了修理三轮手摇车和皮鞋，有的学会了打毛线，缝纫和绣花，有的参加种菜和养猪。他们都说，“我们身残志不残，我们是革命的乐观主义者，我们要当社会主义促进派。”问他们为什么这样乐观？杜双全就会告诉你：
    为什么同志们乐观好？
    皆因共产党领导好。刘渝生就会告诉你：
    祖国的命运就是我们的命运，
    我们和祖国心连心。
    社会主义是我们的灵魂，
    党就是抚育我们成长的母亲。四川荣誉军人同志们的这种革命乐观主义代表着我国解放了的社会生产力的无限的生命力。它将摧毁一切沉沉暮气和腐朽的垃圾，所向披靡。
    荣军同志们的文艺创作是我们社会主义文化园地中最崇高的和最应该受人尊敬的文艺。它纯朴、明朗、强烈、豪爽，它有无穷的感引力。谁要参加创造社会主义的民族的新文化的伟大事业，谁就应该俯首贴耳地向他们学习，学习他们的势如破竹的共产主义的风格，学习他们的革命乐观主义，学习他们的革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的，为劳动人民喜闻乐见的文艺创作。
    那些不知要超过奴隶主时代封建主时代和资本主义世界几十倍几百倍的最伟大的创作和最伟大的作家艺术家，肯定无疑地将来自这些最普通的人们中间。
    最可敬最可爱的战士们，我歌颂你们，带着欢笑和忍不住的骄傲的眼泪。 　　　　　　 6月2日于北京医院
