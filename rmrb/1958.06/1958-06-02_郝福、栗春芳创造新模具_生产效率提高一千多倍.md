Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st—Hao Fu and Li Chunfang, young fitters at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, recently created a multi-variety, multi-piece bending die. Using this mold for processing, production efficiency has increased by 1,110 times compared to the past. With this mold, the task of producing more than 3,300 spring iron pieces for the entire year is completed in just ten minutes.

The multi-variety, multi-piece bending die is a mold for manufacturing round car spring iron. In the past, to make spring iron, iron sheets had to be cut into small strips by hand, then bent one by one, and then corrected manually one by one. It took three minutes and forty-two seconds to make one spring iron, and the quality often did not meet the standards. Using a multi-variety, multi-piece bending die, eight hundred spring irons of three specifications can be made simultaneously in only two minutes and thirty seconds, and the products fully meet the specifications. At the same time as creating the multi-variety, multi-piece bending die, Hao Fu also successfully trial-produced a spring iron cutting die, increasing efficiency by 80 and a half times. The creation of these two molds has changed the production process of spring iron from manual operation to mechanization.

A few months ago, Hao Fu was still a well-known backward worker in the factory. Under the education and help of the Party and Youth League organizations, especially in the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, Hao Fu gradually realized his mistakes. In the Double-Anti movement, he severely examined his erroneous thoughts and expressed his determination to immediately make a major turnaround in production and thought. From then on, he was full of energy, painstakingly studied and dared to think and act. After work, he either drafted designs or used waste materials to trial-produce molds, and quickly became a technical innovation expert. Before creating the multi-variety, multi-piece bending die, he created and improved 55 tools and molds. Now, this young fitter has become a banner in the technical innovation movement in Taiyuan.

### 郝福、栗春芳创造新模具  生产效率提高一千多倍

　　郝福、栗春芳创造新模具
    生产效率提高一千多倍
    据新华社太原1日电山西机床厂青年钳工郝福和栗春芳，最近制成了一种一模多样多件压弯模。利用这种模具加工，生产效率比过去提高一千一百一十倍。这种模具生产，在十分钟内便完成了全年生产三千三百多件弹璜铁的任务。
    一模多样多件压弯模是制造圆车弹璜铁的模具。过去制造弹璜铁，先要用手把铁片剪成一条一条的小条，然后一个个压弯，再逐一用手工校正。这样制作一个弹璜铁，需时三分四十二秒，质量也经常达不到标准。使用一模多样多件压弯模加工，只用二分三十秒钟就能同时制作出八百多个三种规格的弹璜铁，而且产品完全合乎规格。在制成一模多样多件压弯模的同时，郝福还试制成功了弹璜铁切断模，提高效率八十倍半。由于这两件模具的制成，就把弹璜铁的生产过程由手工操作改变为机械化。
    几个月前，郝福还是全厂出名的落后工人。在党团组织的教育和帮助下，特别是在反右派和整风运动中，郝福逐渐认识到了他的错误。在双反运动中他狠狠地检查了自己的错误思想，表示立即在生产和思想上来一个大翻身。从此他干劲十足，刻苦钻研敢想敢作，一下班不是绘图便是利用废料试制模具，很快就变为技术革新的能手。在创造一模多样多件压弯模之前，他就创造和改进了五十五件工具和模具。现在，这个年青的钳工已经成为太原市的技术革新运动中的一面旗帜。（附图片）
