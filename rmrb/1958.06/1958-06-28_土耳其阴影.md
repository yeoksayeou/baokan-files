So-called "Freedom and Democracy"

    Turkish officials once proclaimed that Turkey was a "great free and democratic country." However, in this so-called "free and democratic" country, a shadow of terror hangs everywhere, and many innocent people are constantly persecuted. For example, the president of Ankara University was recently forced to resign, merely because he had published an article discussing "socialization" back in 1920. Several other professors at the university were also arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges.
    Turkish officials prohibit all university professors from engaging in political activities. The activities of journalists are even more strictly controlled. In 1957, the Ankara Journalists Union was banned because it meddled in "political issues." At the end of last year, the only democratically inclined newspaper in the country, the Istanbul "National Newspaper," was shut down, and its editor was imprisoned for the crime of "progressive thought."
    Although the country has a parliament, the members do not even enjoy the freedom to criticize the government. Parliamentarian Borukbaki was arrested last year for the crime of "criticism." Except during election campaigns, all political propaganda is prohibited. In the summer of 1957, a parliamentarian shook hands with several pedestrians in the market of the city where he was elected, and was fined a heavy sum.
    The rights of the working people are even less guaranteed. Strikes have always been prohibited. Workers who strike despite the ban are subjected to brutal repression. Communists, who have been forced to operate underground since 1921, are constantly being searched for and arrested.

    America's Cannon Fodder Depot
    The Turkish government follows the war policy of U.S. imperialism, actively expanding its military and preparing for war, participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact cobbled together by the United States, and acting as a subservient pawn of the United States in the Middle East. Currently, the United States has many military bases in Turkey. U.S. monopoly capital is intensifying its penetration into the economic lifeline of Turkey. U.S. surplus goods are dumped in large quantities in Turkey, and Hollywood's obscene films and various vulgar tabloids flood Turkish towns and cities.
    Turkey maintains a huge army of hundreds of thousands of people, becoming a huge cannon fodder depot for the United States. Although the Turkish government can obtain a sum of U.S. "aid" from the United States every year, it still bears a heavy military expenditure itself. Due to too much foreign debt, it has to pay more than 100 million Turkish pounds in interest alone each year. No wonder a Turkish official asked with a bellyful of complaints: "Besides the military, what else is the West interested in about Turkey?"

    Abyss of Hunger
    The heavy military burden has brought a serious crisis to Turkey's financial economy. Coupled with the frantic plunder of U.S. monopoly capital and the cruel exploitation of Turkish landlord capitalists, the lives of the Turkish people have fallen into extreme poverty. In the past year alone, the cost of living has risen by more than 35%. Currently, the average annual income per capita in Turkey is only 500 Turkish pounds. The average teacher's monthly income is only 250 to 300 Turkish pounds, and the monthly income of a traffic policeman is less than 150 Turkish pounds. This little income is simply not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. For example, the simplest meal costs two or three Turkish pounds. In Istanbul, a two-room small house without facilities costs 250 Turkish pounds per month to rent.
    The Turkish people, who are in the abyss of hunger and suffering, will never willingly endure enslavement and exploitation. The struggle for peace, democracy, and the right to a living is unfolding more and more widely.

    土耳其阴影
    如此“自由民主”
    土耳其的官方人士曾经宣扬说：土耳其是一个“伟大的自由民主国家”。但是，在这个所谓“自由民主”的国家内，到处都笼罩着恐怖阴影，许多无辜人士不断遭到迫害。例如，安卡拉大学的校长不久以前被迫辞职，罪名不过是他早在1920年发表过一篇谈“社会主义化”的文章。这个大学的其他几位教授也因莫须有的罪状而被捕入狱。
    土耳其官方禁止所有的大学教授从事政治活动。新闻记者的活动更受到严密的控制。1957年，安卡拉的新闻工作者工会就因过问“政治问题”而被禁止活动。去年年底，这个国家唯一具有民主倾向的伊斯坦布尔“国家报”被查封了，该报编辑也因“思想进步”的罪名而被监禁。
    这个国家虽然也有议会，但是议员们甚至不能享有批评政府的自由。议员伯鲁克巴奇就是因犯有“批评”罪而于去年被捕。除竞选期间外，官方禁止一切政治宣传。1957年夏天，一位议员在他当选的城市市场上同几个行人握手，结果竟被罚以重款。
    劳动人民的权利更加没有保障。罢工是一直被禁止的。工人们如果不顾禁令而罢工，就会遭到残酷镇压。从1921年起被迫转入地下活动的共产党员不断遭到搜捕。
    美国的炮灰仓库
    土耳其政府追随美帝国主义的战争政策，积极地扩军备战，参加美国拼凑的北大西洋集团和巴格达条约集团，充当了美国在中东唯命是从的走卒。目前，美国在土耳其拥有许多军事基地。美国垄断资本加紧渗入土耳其的经济命脉，美国过剩商品在土耳其大量倾销，好莱坞的黄色影片和各种低级的画报充斥土耳其的城镇。
    土耳其维持着一支庞大的拥有几十万人的军队，成为美国的巨大炮灰仓库。土耳其政府虽然每年可以向美国讨得一笔美“援”，但是自己仍然负担沉重的军费。由于外债太多，每年光利息就要付出一亿多土镑。难怪土耳其的一位重要人士满腹牢骚地发出这样的问题：“除了军队以外，西方对土耳其还有什么感兴趣的呢？”
    饥饿的深渊
    沉重的军费负担给土耳其的财政经济带来了严重的危机。加上美国垄断资本的疯狂掠夺和土耳其地主资本家的残酷搜刮，土耳其人民的生活已陷于极端贫困的境地。仅在最近一年以来，生活费用就上涨了35％以上。目前土耳其每人每年平均收入只有五百土耳其镑。一般教员每月收入只有二百五十至三百土镑，路警每月收入不到一百五十土镑。这点收入根本不够维持最低的生活。例如最简单的一顿饭便要花去两三个土镑。在伊斯坦布尔，一所不带设备的两间小房的住宅，每月便要房租二百五十土镑。
    处于饥饿和痛苦深渊中的土耳其人民，是决不甘心忍受奴役和剥削的。争取和平、民主和生活权利的斗争，正在日益广泛地展开。
