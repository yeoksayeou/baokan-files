　　Caoqiao Township: Every Commune Has a Factory
　　By our reporters Jiang Qingping and Sun Zhen
    This was the first time we had gone to the countryside to report on industrial news. All the way, we kept thinking about one question: What does a rural area with industry look like? What role does industry play in agricultural production?

    Factories Sparking Amidst Greenery
    We arrived in Caoqiao Township, Wujin County, and saw many township-run and agricultural cooperative-run factories in the market town and villages. In the villages shaded by green willows, sparks flew, and the sound of sawing wood echoed. The seat of the township People's Committee—Caoqiao Town—rhythmically transmitted the sound of machines, and a newly built chimney stood on the street. Along the highway from Changzhou to Caoqiao Township, high-voltage power lines stretched from afar to here.

    Caoqiao Township originally had more handicrafts, but they were scattered and independent, unable to expand production and improve technology. Now, the township People's Committee has concentrated the existing handicraft workers, tools, and equipment separately to build many small factories. Some use the original machine power and add new workshops. Most of the factory buildings use surplus public housing and ancestral halls. The whole township started running factories in early April, and now more than 130 have been established, more than half of which have already been put into production. All fifteen communes in the township now have factories, including farm tool repair and manufacturing, feed processing, granular fertilizer processing, construction, brick kilns, and weaving, totaling dozens of industries.

    Frequent Good News About New Farm Tools
    As soon as we arrived at the Caoqiao Township People's Committee, we met Wang Huda, deputy director of the Huangnian Cooperative, and Cheng Fuliang, the branch secretary, who were bringing workers from the farm tool factory to report good news to the township People's Committee and the township Party Committee. Their newly established farm tool manufacturing and repair factory successfully trial-produced a double-person pedal-powered automatic forward rake and an automatic unloading bulldozer in seven days. Some of the workers had tried to produce new farm tools in the past, but they were not successful because of economic and technical difficulties. Now, in just seven days, new farm tools have been successfully manufactured. That morning, they brought the good news and also delivered the new farm tools to the township People's Committee. Many farmers praised these new farm tools.

    These days, in many agricultural cooperatives, people are visiting and testing new farm tools everywhere. All twenty farm tool factories in the township have trial-produced and modified more than 180 pieces of various farm tools in one month. There are enclosed waterwheels, new-style walking plows, double-tube sprayers, dual-purpose iron shovels, rice and wheat dual-purpose threshers, and dual-purpose hoes. These new farm tools are urgently needed in the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    Repairing Farm Tools Without Leaving the Commune
    When we visited the farm tool factories, every household's door was filled with old farm tools, and the workers were repairing them. We also saw some workers carrying iron and wood tools such as axes and saws to repair old farm tools in various production teams. Now, agricultural cooperatives can repair farm tools without leaving the commune. In the past, it would take one or two months to repair all the old farm tools in the township. Last year, the farm agricultural cooperative could not find a carpenter, and some farm tools were not repaired in time. This year, the commune has established a woodworking factory, and the farm tools of nearby production teams can be repaired in the factory; the farm tools of distant production teams can be repaired by workers carrying tools to the door, which is much more convenient than in the past. Chen Qingda, an old commune member of the Yunnan Cooperative, has been farming for more than forty years. This year, he used a modified walking plow. When he tested it, he found some shortcomings, and the workers repaired it according to his suggestions. After the repair, he carried the walking plow back to the commune and said to the commune members: "In the past, an old plow would break five times in a season, but this plow looks like it can be used for several years."

    Small Factories Undertake the Construction of Electrical Irrigation Stations
    Caoqiao Township has established various factories. The Liushi Agricultural Cooperative and the Farm Agricultural Cooperative are jointly building an electrical irrigation station that irrigates more than 9,000 mu of paddy fields and a feed processing factory. This project was originally planned to be contracted out to workers from other places, but now the iron factory, woodworking factory, construction factory, and brick kiln factory of these two cooperatives have completely undertaken the construction task. The director of the Farm Cooperative, who is leading the construction of the electrical irrigation station, is also the director of the construction factory and the woodworking factory. He said: "Now it is possible to build a factory building without leaving the commune." The workers are working hard to ensure that the construction project is completed before transplanting.

    Township and Commune Cadres Learn Industry
    Some township and commune cadres have begun to grasp agriculture with one hand and industry with the other. In the past, they mostly read news and articles about rural areas in newspapers, but now they pay attention to reading news and articles about industry. Every time they inspect work, they check both agricultural production and industrial production. Some work in the fields during the day and enter the factory at night. Huangyan Cooperative's agricultural production has made a great leap forward this year, with several times more fertilizer accumulated than in previous years. It is also necessary to deep-plow and densely plant, but there are insufficient draught cattle and labor. The director of the commune and the branch secretary studied this situation and promptly proposed to the commune-run factory the task of trial-producing new farm tools. They participated in field labor during the day and studied the trial production work with the workers at night, and quickly produced four new farm tools. Yunnan Cooperative's grain output is very low, mainly due to insufficient fertilizer. Branch Secretary Gu Huanmin ordered a part of the raw materials for manufacturing granular fertilizer last year. At the beginning of this year, he started building a factory, and he himself served as the director of the granular fertilizer factory, and worked hard to learn the technology of manufacturing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium mixed granular fertilizer. Now he has become the most knowledgeable person in the township in manufacturing granular fertilizer. The granular fertilizer factory of Yunnan Cooperative will soon be completed. The township Party committee plans to use this factory as a basis, first make a model, and then develop new granular fertilizer factories.

　　The Worker-Peasant Alliance Takes Root
    Although the factories that have been established in Caoqiao Township are all small factories, they are new sprouts and are gradually developing and growing, and will eventually change the face of the countryside. Many people have already seen this prospect. For example, Xu Baoming, the deputy captain of the production team of the Huzhuang Cooperative, said that now the commune has stores, credit cooperative service stations, agricultural middle schools, and factories, which have laid the foundation for the urbanization of the countryside. The township party secretary told us: "In the past, the propaganda said that farmers should rely on the support of workers, and some farmers did not completely believe it. Now, after establishing these small factories, they have further seen the role of industry in agricultural production, and the worker-peasant alliance has taken root."

    Township and commune-run factories have consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. The broad masses of farmers love these factories, support these factories, and further see the socialist prospects. Many farmers have vacated surplus houses to be used as factory buildings, and handed over wood and scrap iron reserved for their own use to the factories, so that these factories can build factories and carry out production at the same time.

    Caoqiao Township's vigorous development of industry is just the beginning, and factories under construction will be put into production one after another. When we left this township, the new chimney of the feed processing factory was already emitting thick black smoke. (Attached picture)

　　社社有厂的漕桥乡
　　本报记者　蒋青萍　孙振
    我们第一次到农村采访工业新闻，一路上都在想着一个问题：有了工业的农村是怎样的面貌；工业对农业生产起了什么作用？
    绿荫里工厂火花飞
    我们到了武进县漕桥乡，在集镇上和村庄里，看到了许多乡办的和农业社办的工厂。在绿柳成荫的村庄里，飞溅着火花，响着锯木声。乡人民委员会的所在地——漕桥镇，有节奏地传送着机器声，街头上矗立起一个新建的烟囱。沿着常州市到漕桥乡的公路上，高压输电线从远处向这里延伸。
    漕桥乡原来的手工业较多，但是分散单干，不能扩大生产和改进技术。现在乡人民委员会把现有手工业工人、工具设备分别集中起来，建成许多小厂。有的是利用原来机器的动力，增加新的车间。厂房大多是利用多余的公房和祠堂等。全乡从4月上旬开始办厂，到现在已经办了一百三十多个，有一半以上已投入生产。全乡十五个社，已经社社有了工厂，包括农具修配制造、饲料加工、颗粒肥料加工、建筑营造、砖瓦窑以及编织等几十种行业。
    新农具捷报频传
    我们一到漕桥乡人民委员会，就遇着这个乡的黄埝社副主任王虎大和支部书记承夫良，带着农具厂的工人来向乡人民委员会和乡党委会报喜。他们新办的农具制造修配厂，七天内就试制成功了双人脚踏自动前进耙和自动卸土推土车。他们中间有的工人，过去也曾试制新农具，因为经济和技术上都有困难，没有试成。现在，在短短的七天内，新农具就制成功了。他们这天上午带着喜报，还把新农具送到乡人民委员会。许多农民都称赞这种新农具。
    这几天，在许多农业社里，人们到处在参观和试验新农具。全乡二十个农具厂，在一个月内共试制和改制成功各色农具一百八十多件。有封闭式水车、新式步犁、双管喷雾器、两用铁铲、稻麦两用脱粒机以及两用锄头等。这些新农具都是农业生产大跃进中迫切需要的。
    整修农具不出社
    我们到农具厂访问时，家家门前都放满旧农具，工人们正在修理。我们还看到有些工人带着斧头、锯子等铁木工具，分别到各个生产队整修旧农具。现在农业社修理农具可以不出社。过去全乡要把旧农具修好，总得拖延一两个月。农场农业社去年没有找到木工，有些农具没有及时修理。今年社里办了木工厂，附近生产队的农具可进厂修理；远处生产队的农具，工人们带着工具上门修理，要比过去方便多了。运南社老社员陈清大，已经耕田四十多年了，今年用了改制步犁，试用时发现有缺点，工人们根据他的意见进行了修理。修好以后，他肩着步犁回到社里对社员们说：“过去老犁一季要坏五个，现在这个犁看样子可以用上几年。”
    小工厂承建电灌站
    漕桥乡办了各种各样的工厂。刘市农业社和农场农业社正在联合建设一座灌溉九千多亩水稻田的电力灌溉站和一座饲料加工厂。这项工程原准备请外地工人承包的，现在这两个社的铁工厂、木工厂、建筑工厂、砖瓦窑厂完全承担了这项建筑任务。领导建设电力灌溉站的农场社社主任，又是建筑工厂和木业工厂的厂长，他说：“现在建筑一个厂房也可以不出社”。工人们为了保证在插秧以前完成这项建设工程，正积极紧张地劳动着。
    乡社干部学工业
    有些乡社干部开始一手抓农业，一手抓工业。他们过去看报纸多数看农村的新闻和文章，现在注意阅读有关工业的新闻和文章了。他们每次检查工作，既检查农业生产，也检查工业生产，有的白天下田，晚上进工厂。黄堰社今年农业生产大跃进，积肥比往年多几倍，又要深耕密植，耕牛、劳动力不足，社主任和支部书记研究了这个情况，及时向社办工厂提出试制新农具的任务。他们白天参加田间劳动，晚上和工人们一道研究试制工作，很快就制成四种新农具。运南社粮食产量很低，主要是肥料不足，支部书记顾焕民去年就订购了一部分制造颗粒肥料的原料，今年一开始建厂，他自己兼任颗粒肥料厂的厂长，努力学习制造氮磷钾混合颗粒肥料的技术，现在已经成为全乡制造颗粒肥料最内行的人了。运南社的颗粒肥料厂即将建成，乡党委计划以这个厂为基础，先做出样子，再发展新的颗粒肥料厂。
　　工农联盟扎根
    漕桥乡现在办起来的工厂虽然都是小工厂，但这是新的萌芽，是在逐步发展成长中的，最后能改变农村面貌。许多人已经看到了这种前景，如浒庄社生产队副队长许宝明说，现在社里有了商店、信用社服务站、农业中学，又有了工厂，为农村城市化打好了墙脚。乡党委书记告诉我们说：“过去宣传农民要靠工人支援，有的农民还不完全相信，现在办了这些小厂，进一步看到了工业对于农业生产的作用，工农联盟扎根了。”
    乡社办工厂，巩固了工农联盟，广大农民热爱这些工厂，支持这些工厂，并进一步看到了社会主义远景。许多农民腾出多余的房子做厂房，把留作自己用的木料、废铁交给工厂，使这些工厂一边建厂，一边进行生产。
    漕桥乡大办工业还才是开始，正在筹建中的工厂将陆续投入生产。在我们离开这个乡的时候，饲料加工厂的新烟囱，已经冒出了浓浓的黑烟。（附图片）
