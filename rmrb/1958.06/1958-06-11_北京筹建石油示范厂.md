    Beijing Preparing to Build Petroleum Demonstration Plant
    (Our dispatch) A synthetic petroleum factory with an annual output of 3,500 tons—the Beijing Coal-to-Oil Demonstration Plant—is being prepared for construction jointly by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Beijing Petroleum Institute. This plant will adopt the latest scientific research achievements, namely, the "medium-pressure iron catalyst fluidized bed water gas synthetic petroleum" method for production.
    For a long time, countries such as Britain and the United States believed that medium-pressure iron catalyst fluidized bed water gas synthetic petroleum could not be produced on a large scale. However, this problem has been successfully researched by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After small-scale and medium-scale production trials, it has been proven possible to carry out industrial-scale production. Therefore, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry decided to establish a synthetic petroleum plant in Beijing.
    The Beijing Coal-to-Oil Demonstration Plant began preparations in April of this year and is expected to be put into production before April next year. At present, the Beijing Petroleum Institute has specially assigned some professors and lecturers to be responsible for the preparatory work. When reviewing the factory's design and construction drawings, more than 30 related professors, associate professors, and lecturers concentrated their time on research. A part of the graduating students from the petroleum refining department are not doing graduation designs but are concentrating their efforts on assisting the factory in solving some technical problems.
    After the completion of this factory, it will be very convenient for the Petroleum Institute's teaching to be combined with production, theory linked with practice, scientific research, and diligence-thrift work-study programs.

    北京筹建石油示范厂
    本报讯　一个年产三千五百吨的人造石油工厂——北京煤炼油示范厂正由石油工业部和北京石油学院共同合作筹建中。这个厂将采用最新的科学研究成果，即“中压铁剂流化床水煤气合成石油”的办法进行生产。
    长期以来，英、美等国认为中压铁剂流化床水煤气合成石油，不可能大规模地进行生产。但是，这个难题为中国科学院研究成功了，经过小型和中型的生产试验以后，证明有可能进行工业规模的生产，因而石油工业部决定在北京建立一个人造石油厂。
    北京煤炼油示范厂是从今年4月开始筹建的，预计明年4月以前即可投入生产。目前，北京石油学院专门委派了一些教授、讲师负责筹建工作，在审查工厂的设计施工图纸时，有关的教授、副教授和讲师三十多人集中时间进行研究。石油炼制系一部分应届毕业生，不作毕业设计，集中力量协助这个工厂解决一些技术问题。
    这个工厂建成以后，对于石油学院的教学结合生产、理论联系实际、科学研究和勤工俭学都有很大的方便。
