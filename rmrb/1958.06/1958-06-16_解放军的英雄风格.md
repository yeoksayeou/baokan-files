The people of Beijing, returning from working on the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, are enthusiastically talking about the heroic style of the People's Liberation Army. They say: The Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site is a communist university, and there, the People's Liberation Army has become the top name on the honor roll.

More than 40,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are working alongside the people of Beijing on the reservoir construction site. Marshals personally organize and command the battle. Generals eat, live, and labor alongside the soldiers. These respected generals are all veteran Red Army soldiers who climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands. They bravely fought for the liberation of the motherland and its people for decades, and many still bear the glorious scars on their bodies today. Now, they are selflessly participating in the battle to conquer nature for the motherland's splendid socialist beauty. Each of them appears as an ordinary worker, carrying loads of earth on their shoulders, striding forward quickly. Just like the poem composed and sung by Lieutenant General Huang Zhiyong: "Listening to the song of the Long March, recalling the joyous climb over the snow-capped mountains of yesteryear, now participating in building the reservoir, growing stronger with age and striving to be the first."

The vast number of officers and soldiers are the elite troops under these strong generals, and they fight wherever the task is arduous. When carrying earth, they carry it over "two mountain peaks" in one go; when pushing carts, they launch "full cart movement," pushing three to four hundred pounds of earth up the several-story-high dam top in one breath. Ramming earth is an unfamiliar task for many officers and soldiers, but they learn if they don't know how, and they study if they don't understand. Heroic Company Commander Wang Kewu visited the civilian worker team, learned the key points of calling out the ramming song and controlling the rammer in two hours, and led his soldiers to exceed the quota in one day. They were covered in sweat under the scorching sun, and their voices were hoarse, but their fighting spirit remained high.

People especially praise a heroic engineering unit. They came to the reservoir construction site in February, braving snow and ice, and took on the arduous task of clearing the foundation for the dam. They launched attacks on stubborn rocks on cliffs and steep slopes. They often couldn't drink hot water or eat hot meals, but the battle continued day and night, and the sound of hammers striking steel drills and explosions echoed throughout the mountains and fields. Many soldiers' hands were swollen from the cold, and their tiger's mouths were worn out, but they still persisted in working. They proudly sang: "I am a demolition expert, the mountains tremble when they see me; as long as the superiors give the order, the high mountains will immediately lower their heads!" In this way, they cut off half of the two mountain peaks on the East Mountain Pass, totaling 190,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. If these stones were used to build a one-meter-wide and one-meter-high wall, it could circle the inner city of Beijing nine and a half times. What an amazing miracle!

Our soldiers are all good at creating and dare to act. At the construction site, when you surprisingly discover: "How can cars run on the railway?" "How can trucks climb the nine-story-high dam slope?" Then people will tell you cheerfully: "These are all creations of the People's Liberation Army comrades!"

Colonel Zhang Jianmin was the first to propose using small trains to transport materials at the beginning of the reservoir project, in order to replace the heavy manual labor. He converted the broken tanks captured in the war into tractors that could pull long trains of dump trucks, which quickly realized the mechanization of transportation tools on the reservoir construction site and greatly improved the efficiency of transporting earth. His spirit of bold creation encouraged and promoted the entire construction site. Military vehicle instructor Meng Zhaofu and his comrades created a "small train" in which automobiles pulled more than twenty loaded dump trucks on the railway, which increased the efficiency of transporting earth by six or seven times.

The people of China throughout the ages have praised Dayu's flood control efforts, calling his "three passes through his home without entering" a beautiful story. Today, the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers' stories of selflessly serving the people at the Ming Tombs are even more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Military officer Liu Xuelu postponed his wedding to build the reservoir, and brought his fiancée to the construction site to launch a labor competition with each other. When soldier Yin Dezhen came to the construction site, he passed by his hometown without going home. His parents came to the construction site to find him one after another, asking him to go home and get married. He led the old people to visit the project, saying: "I am one of the ten thousand people on the reservoir construction site, and without me, the dam would have several cubic meters of earth less every day."

Another moving story that people tell is that on the night of March 23, there was a cold rain. The civilian workers, students, and office cadres working on the construction site did not have raincoats. At this time, thousands of People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers took off their raincoats and enthusiastically draped them over the civilian workers, students, and office cadres. In the cold rain, the officers and soldiers shouted the slogan "Compete with the Dragon King" and kept working non-stop. This spirit moved and inspired everyone on the entire construction site, and they fought in the rain until dawn.

This is the heroic style of the People's Liberation Army, intelligent, brave, and loving the people. It is like a bright red flag, shining in the hearts of the people. (Attached pictures)

The Eighteen Warriors Assault Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army jumped from carrying three cubic meters of earth per day to carrying 17.3 cubic meters of earth per day. The picture shows Lu Bin (left), one of the eighteen warriors, carrying six baskets.

This is the "earth train" created by Meng Zhaofu of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, using automobiles to pull trailers on rails. This method of transportation increases the efficiency of transporting materials by six to seven times compared to automobile transportation.

    解放军的英雄风格
    新华社记者　姜庆肇　徐学增
    北京人民在从十三陵水库工地劳动回来的时候，都热烈地谈论着解放军的英雄风格。他们说：十三陵水库工地是一所共产主义大学，在那里，解放军成了红榜上的第一名。
    有四万多解放军官兵同北京人民一起劳动在水库工地上。元帅们亲自组织指挥战斗。将军们和士兵一起同吃、同住、同劳动。敬爱的将军们，都是爬雪山、过草地的老红军。他们为了祖国人民的解放事业，曾经英勇征战了数十年，今天好多人的身上还闪烁看光荣的疤痕。现在，他们又为祖国灿烂的社会主义美景而忘我地参加了征服大自然的战斗。他们个个都以普通劳动者的姿态出现，挑着一担担泥土，飞步前进。真像黄志勇中将编唱的诗歌一样：“听唱长征忆当年，当年雪山爬的欢，而今参加修水库，老当益壮夺争先。”
    广大官兵就是这些强将手下的精兵，哪里任务艰巨，他们就战斗在哪里。挑土，一挑就是“两个山头”；推车，就开展“满车运动”，把三、四百斤重的泥土一口气推上几层楼高的大坝顶。打夯是许多官兵生疏的活儿，但是他们不会就学，不懂就钻。英雄连长王克武走访民工队，两个钟头学会了喊夯歌和掌夯的要领，回来带领战士们一天就突破了定额。他们在烈日下累得满身大汗，嗓子都喊哑了，可是斗志依然高昂。
    人们特别赞颂一支英雄的工程兵部队。他们在2月份踏冰冒雪来到水库工地，肩负起为大坝清基的艰巨任务。他们在悬崖削壁上向顽石展开攻击。常常喝不上热水，吃不上热饭，但是战斗日夜不停，漫山遍岭响起一片铁锤猛击钢钎的叮当声和爆破声。许多战士的手冻肿了，虎口磨破了，仍然坚持劳动。他们自豪地唱道：“我是一名爆破手，群山见我就发抖；只要上级下命令，高山立刻就低头！”就这样，他们把东山口的两座山头削下了半壁，共达十九万石方。如果把这些石头砌成一公尺宽、一公尺高的垒壁，可以绕北京内城九圈半。这是一件多么惊人的奇迹！
    我们的战士人人善于创造，敢作敢为。在工地上，当你惊讶地发现：“汽车怎么能在铁路上跑？”“大卡车怎么能爬上九层楼高的大坝坡？”这时人们就会爽快地告诉你：“这都是解放军同志们创造的！”
    张健民上校在水库工程的开始，就第一个倡议采用小火车运料，以代替人力的繁重劳动。他把战争中缴获来的破坦克改装成可牵引长列斗车的牵引车，使水库工地上迅速实现了运输工具机械化，大大提高了运土效率。他的大胆创造的精神，鼓舞和推动了整个工地。军车教员孟昭孚和他的战友们，创造了汽车在铁路上牵引二十多个载重斗车的“小火车”，使运土效率提高了六七倍。
    我国历代人民把大禹治水“三过家门不入”传为美谈。今天，解放军官兵在十三陵舍己为民的佳话，却更深入人心。军官刘学鲁为修建水库推迟了结婚时间，并且带着未婚妻到工地互相展开了劳动竞赛。战士殷德珍来工地时，路过故乡也不进家门。他的父母亲先后到工地找他，要他回家成亲。他却领着老人一面参观工程，一面说：“我是水库工地上的十万人之一，缺了我，大坝上每天就要少好几方土。”
    人们传为美谈的还有一个动人的故事。3月23日深夜下了一场冷雨。劳动在工地上的民工、学生和机关干部们都没有雨衣。这时，几千名解放军官兵纷纷把自己的雨衣脱了下来，热情地披到民工、学生和机关干部的身上。在冷雨中，官兵们高呼着：“和龙王爷竞赛”的口号，一个劲儿地干个不停。这种精神感动和鼓舞了全工地的人们，一直冒雨战斗到天明。
    这就是人民解放军的英雄风格，智勇双全，热爱人民。她像一面鲜艳的红旗，辉映在人民的心目中。（附图片）
