Consumers' Voice:

    Wanli Toothpaste Tube Is Not Durable
    Recently, we two each bought a tube of the newly produced "Wanli Toothpaste" from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Good Morning Pharmaceutical Company. When we used it for the first time, we first squeezed the root of the toothpaste tube. As a result, the area where our fingers squeezed completely broke, and the toothpaste poured out from the cracks. We originally thought we used too much force, so we gently squeezed the upper part of the toothpaste tube, but it broke again. In this way, there were four or five cracks in a toothpaste tube, making it unusable, which is really frustrating! We hope this company will improve the quality of the toothpaste tubes.

    万里牙膏管不结实
    最近，我们二人各自买了一管上海公私合营好来药物公司新出品的“万里牙膏”，拿回来第一次使用时，先挤牙膏管的根部，结果手指挤的地方全部破裂，牙膏由裂缝涌出。我们原以为用力过大，于是，再轻轻地挤牙膏管的上部，结果又是破裂，就这样，在一管牙膏管上有四、五处裂开，无法使用，真使人懊恼！希望这个公司改进牙膏管的质量。  杨松柏（南京）
