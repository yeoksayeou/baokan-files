These things happened inside the Chiang Army.

The following are the angry denunciations of the fascist rule within the Chiang army by Yu Guofan, Third Class First Grade Petty Officer of the Chiang army's Haijun Zhongxing warship, and Cui Chenglin, head of the ship's service group, who recently returned from Taiwan. They are both witnesses who have personally suffered from the persecution of secret agents and have heard and witnessed the crimes of the Chiang family's secret agents.

Yu Guofan was once thrown into the Chiang army's Navy Zuoying "Military Discipline Practice Team" by the Chiang army authorities on the charge of "lacking confidence in counterattacking the mainland." On both sides of the team's gate were written the eight large characters "Hearts like iron, laws like fire." The courtyard was filled with an atmosphere of terror. Under the threat of the secret agents' bayonets and wooden sticks, many emaciated people were desperately jumping with dozens of pounds of iron wheels on their shoulders. People often fainted, some were hung on large trees and beaten with screams, and others were stripped naked and forced to stand against the wall with their hands raised.

The Practice Team usually had three subjects: "Military Discipline Education," "Labor Exercise," and "Spiritual Education." "Military Discipline Education" was cruel and typical fascist education. At the command of the secret agent leader, the personnel "under training" were forced to pass naked through a ring of fire ignited by gasoline and crawl over jagged rocks like wolf teeth. If they crawled too slowly, the flames would burn them; if they crawled too fast, the rocks on the ground would pierce them. Over time, many people were covered in burn scars, and their palms and knees were covered in blood. At the same time, the secret agent leader often held a short stick and shouted wildly, "Why are you frowning? Give me a smile!" So, you had to smile. "Give me a cry, a big cry!" You had to howl, otherwise the wooden sticks and whips would hit you. Sometimes, the secret agent leader assembled the team under the scorching sun, ordered everyone to put on raincoats, and then he pulled a person from the team and asked, "Why are you wearing a raincoat?" The person answering said, "I was wrong!" and would be slapped. If he said, "You ordered me to wear it," he would be punished for violating "military discipline." Taiwanese soldier Gao Decai was beaten with a hundred military sticks for violating "military discipline," and then hung on a tree for five hours. When he was taken down, he was unconscious. Some people were tortured to death in this way.

The Chiang army's army had one such "Military Discipline Practice Team" per division, and the navy had three. Those who were sent were so-called "dissatisfied with the status quo" and "lost confidence in counterattacking the mainland." These people had to "train" for three to six months. If they did not "pass," they would be sent to the Huoshaodao concentration camp and the "Fengshan Reception Center" for long-term torture.

The "Fengshan Reception Center" was located in the most desolate place between Kaohsiung and Pingshan in Taiwan. It was one of the concentration camps with the most Chiang army personnel imprisoned. High walls were surrounded by many pillboxes, layers of barbed wire and anti-escape rivers, with sentries every five steps and guards every ten steps, and military police vehicles equipped with machine guns patrolled back and forth. The prison was equipped with "cage cells," "water prisons," "man traps," and various torture instruments made in the United States. Cui Chenglin and Yu Guofan's two friends had been there. They saw with their own eyes that in a "black cave," there were piles of miserably dead bodies and skeletons, and many people whose eyes had been gouged out and arms cut off by secret agents were rolling and crawling around there. Neurosis, paralysis, blindness, and many infectious diseases were prevalent in the cells. Those who did not die were also tortured to the point of being on the verge of death. Now this prison, like other prisons in Taiwan, is already overcrowded. Therefore, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has set up one "black death camp" and "reformatory" after another in Tainan, Penghu, and some small islands near Taiwan, detaining a large number of junior officers and soldiers who have mutinied, deserted, or resisted orders.

In addition to the "Military Discipline Practice Team" and concentration camps, the secret agent control within the Chiang army is also intensifying step by step. Many secret agents are distributed to the lowest-level units of the Chiang army. Each battalion and company has "security officers" and undercover secret agents. In the navy, each warship is also assigned open armed secret agents to monitor the words and deeds of officers and soldiers, and they can arrest and shoot people to death at will. In one large-scale army-wide arrest, thirty-seven officers and soldiers were arrested from Yu Guofan's ship in one night.

However, these terrorist rules cannot stop the phenomena of escape and suicide within the Chiang army. Mutinies and anti-American incidents are still increasing. In the past year alone, more than a dozen people committed suicide and more than a hundred deserted in the Chiang army's Marine Corps alone. In many counties and cities in southern Taiwan, many young Chiang army personnel, in the name of the "Youth Soldier Association" and "Second Phase of Youth Soldiers," posted slogans or issued open letters demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek clique allow them to retire, and stated that if they could not achieve their goals, they would take bloody action. In May of last year, the Chiang army authorities used the Hualien wheel to transport a batch of soldiers from Taiwan to Kinmen. In the middle of the journey, the captain led the soldiers in an armed uprising, which was bloodily suppressed by the secret agents on board. In Anping Port, Tainan, a soldier of the Marine Corps used a machine gun to kill seven officers, including the company commander and the commanding officer. When he was arrested, he cursed Chiang Kai-shek for being shameless and selling out the country. This made Chiang Kai-shek and the American advisors very uneasy. At present, the Chiang army troops in Taiwan, except for live ammunition exercises and emergency situations, do not issue bullets to ordinary soldiers and junior officers, in order to prevent large-scale anti-Chiang and anti-American incidents.

    这些事发生在蒋军内部
    新华社记者  丁固
    这里记述的，是最近从台湾归来的蒋军海军中兴号军舰上的三等一级士官长于国藩和舰勤组长崔成霖对蒋军内部实行法西斯统治的愤怒控诉。他们都是亲身受过特务迫害和耳闻目击蒋家特务罪行的见证人。
    于国藩曾经被蒋军当局以“反攻大陆缺乏信心”的罪名，投进蒋军海军左营“军纪实践队”。这个队的大门两边写着“人心似铁，法令似火”八个大字。院子里充满恐怖气氛，在特务们的刺刀和木棍威迫下，许多骨瘦如柴的人扛着几十斤重的铁轮在拼命奔跳，不时有人昏倒，有的被吊在大树上打得惨叫，也有的被剥光衣服，紧贴墙壁举手罚站。
    实践队平常有三项科目：“军纪教育”、“劳役锻炼”、“精神教育”。“军纪教育”是残酷的典型的法西斯教育。特务头子一声令下，就逼着“受训”的人员光着身子穿过汽油燃起的大火圈，爬过狼牙似的乱石地。爬慢了，烈火烧身，爬快了，地上乱石刺身。日子久了，许多人遍身烧起伤痕，手掌和膝盖也磨得鲜血淋淋。同时，特务头子还常常手持短棍在一旁狂叫：“你为什么愁眉苦脸？你给我笑！”于是，你就得笑，“你给我哭，大哭！”你又得嚎哭，不然木棍和皮鞭就要打到身上。有时，特务头子在烈日当空之下集合队伍，命令大家穿上雨衣，然后，他一把从队伍中拉出一个人，问道：“你为什么穿雨衣？”回答者说：“我错啦！”就要挨一顿巴掌，如果说：“你命令我穿的”，就以违反“军纪”论处。台湾籍士兵高德才就因为违反了“军纪”，先被打了一百军棍，又被吊到树上五个钟点，放下来已经不省人事了。有些人就这样活活地被折磨死了。
    这种“军纪实践队”，蒋军陆军每师一个，海军三个。被送来的都是所谓“不满现状”、“对反攻大陆失去信心”的人。这些人先得“受训”三个月到六个月，不“及格”就要再送到火烧岛集中营和“凤山招待所”去长期受折磨。
    “凤山招待所”设在台湾高雄与屏山中间最荒凉的地方。它是囚禁蒋军人员最多的集中营之一。在高高的围墙四周，筑着许多炮垒，围着层层的铁丝网和防逃河，五步一哨，十步一岗，驾着机关枪的军警车来往巡逻。监狱里设有“格子笼”、“水牢”、“陷人坑”和美国制造的各种刑具。崔成霖和于国藩的两个朋友，曾到过那里，他们亲眼看到在一个“黑山洞”里，堆满了惨死的尸首和骷髅，有不少被特务挖了眼睛、割了胳膊的人在那里乱滚乱爬。牢房里普遍流行着神经症、瘫痪病、失盲症和许多传染病，不死的人也被折磨得奄奄一息。现在这个监狱和台湾其它各个监狱一样已经是人满为患，因此，蒋介石集团又在台南、澎湖和台湾附近的一些小岛屿上增设一个又一个“黑死营”、“感化院”，关押大批暴动、逃亡或抗上的下级军官和士兵。
    除“军纪实践队”和集中营以外，蒋军内部特务控制也步步加紧。许多特务人员都分布到蒋军最低层单位。每个营、连都有“保防军官”和不露身份的特务人员。在海军每艘舰艇上还派有公开的武装特务，监视官兵的言行，并且可以随便逮捕和开枪打死人。在一次全军大逮捕中，一夜之间，于国藩所在舰上就被抓走了三十七名官兵。
    但是，这些恐怖统治并不能制止蒋军内部发生逃亡、自杀现象，兵变和反美事件仍然越来越多。去年一年，仅蒋军海军陆战队就有十多人自杀、一百多人逃亡。在台湾南部的不少县市，不少年青的蒋军人员，用“青年兵协会”和“第二期青年兵”的名义，张贴标语或者发出公开信，要求蒋介石集团允许他们退伍，并且声明说，如果不能达到目的，就要采取流血行动。去年5月，蒋军当局用花莲轮从台湾运送一批士兵开往金门，在半途中，队长就领导士兵武装暴动，结果被随船的特务血腥镇压了。在台南安平港，一个海军陆战队的士兵曾用机枪打死了连长和指挥官等七个军官，最后当他被捕时还大骂蒋介石无耻卖国。这使蒋介石和美国顾问们非常不安。目前在台湾的蒋军部队除实弹演习和有紧急情况外，平时都不发子弹给一般士兵和下级军官，以防发生大规模的反蒋和抗美事件。
