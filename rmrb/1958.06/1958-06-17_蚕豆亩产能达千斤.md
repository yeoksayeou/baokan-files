Broad Beans Yield 1,000 Jin Per Mu

(Reported by this newspaper) According to Yunnan Daily: Dengchuan County, Yunnan Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of broad beans this year. The county's 46,450 mu of broad beans achieved an average yield of 423 jin per mu, of which 540 mu yielded 810 jin per mu, and 14 mu yielded 1,000 jin per mu. This year's yield increased by 32.8% compared to 1957 and 66.2% compared to 1956.

In the past, some cadres and masses in Dengchuan County held views such as "spring crops are lazy crops" and "it is better to plant less well than to plant more, and better to plant little well". For several years, the planting area of broad beans could not be expanded, and the yield was relatively low. In order to break this view of underestimating spring crops, expand the planting area of broad beans, and continuously increase the yield per unit area, the Dengchuan County Party Committee started by summarizing the advanced experiences of the masses, widely publicized the importance of spring production, and at the same time adopted measures such as plowing and harrowing carefully, selecting fine varieties, sowing before the frost, rational close planting, increasing fertilizer application, timely irrigation, and strengthening field management. This gradually changed the past situation of neglecting broad beans after planting, thus ensuring a large-scale bumper harvest of broad beans.

    蚕豆亩产能达千斤
    本报讯　据云南日报消息：云南省邓川县今年获得了蚕豆大面积丰收。全县四万六千四百五十亩蚕豆，平均亩产达到了四百二十三斤，其中有五百四十亩亩产八百一十斤，十四亩亩产一千斤。今年亩产比1957年增加32.8％，比1956年增加66.2％。
    过去，邓川县的部分干部和群众曾有“小春是懒庄稼”、“种多不如种少，种少不如种好”等说法。几年来蚕豆种植面积不能扩大，产量也比较低。为了打破这种轻视小春作物的看法，扩大蚕豆种植面积，不断提高单位面积产量，邓川县委从总结群众中的先进经验入手，广泛宣传小春生产的重要意义，同时采取了犁田细耙、选用良种、霜降前播种、合理密植、增施肥料、适时灌水和加强田间管理等措施，逐步改变了过去把蚕豆种下就不管的状况，因此，保证了蚕豆大面积丰收。
