Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 11th. The Jakarta "Republic Daily" published an editorial on the 11th regarding the activities in Indonesia of a so-called "Free Taiwan Movement" "representative" fostered by the United States. The editorial stated that Taiwan is a natural and integral part of Chinese territory, just as West Irian is part of Indonesian territory. This fact makes us strongly feel that in the struggle for territorial integrity and the elimination of colonialism, Indonesia and China share a common destiny and interests, which prompts us to cooperate more closely in order to expedite the elimination of colonialism.

The editorial pointed out that the so-called "Free Taiwan Movement" is a separatist activity by colonialists attempting to undermine China's friendship with Indonesia. The editorial called on the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate this matter and take necessary measures.

The editorial called on the Indonesian people to be vigilant and not to fall into the trap of foreign countries that do not want to see Indonesia pursue an independent policy and eliminate colonialism.

Jakarta newspapers such as "Republic Daily," "Dongxing Daily," and "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 10th from the Beijing "People's Daily" exposing the conspiracy of the so-called "Free Taiwan Movement" manufactured by the United States.

    雅加达“共和国报”谴责廖文毅分子活动
    号召警惕殖民主义的阴谋
    新华社雅加达11日电　雅加达“共和国报”在11日就美国豢养的所谓“自由台湾运动”的“代表”到印度尼西亚活动这件事发表社论说，台湾是中国领土的当然部分，正像西伊里安是印度尼西亚的领土一样。这一事实使我们强烈地感觉到，在争取领土完整和清除殖民主义的斗争中，印度尼西亚和中国有着共同的命运和利益，这促使我们更加紧密地合作，以便加紧消灭殖民主义。
    社论指出，所谓“自由台湾运动”是殖民主义者企图破坏同印度尼西亚友好的中国的分裂活动，社论要求印度尼西亚外交部对这件事进行调查，并且采取必要的措施。
    社论要求印度尼西亚人民提高警惕，不要上了外国的圈套，这个外国不愿意看到印度尼西亚执行独立的政策和清除殖民主义。
    雅加达“共和国报”、“东星报”和“人民日报”等报纸在10日刊载了北京“人民日报”揭露美国制造的所谓“自由台湾运动”的阴谋的评论。
