    Correctly Handling Contradictions Between Leaders and the Led
    Zhang Xu, Secretary of the宣武 District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing

The contradiction between leaders and the led is one of the contradictions among the people. Judging from the work of the past year, it is of great significance to correctly handle the contradiction between leaders and the led in accordance with the principles indicated in Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." We were not clear about this point before, and even after Chairman Mao's article was published, our understanding was still insufficient. Later, the Central Committee proposed using the methods of big-character posters, great blooming and contending, and great debate to resolve this contradiction. When we were doing this according to the instructions of the Central Committee, we did not foresee the benefits of doing so. After a year, we now see it clearly.

Correctly handling the contradiction between leaders and the led according to Chairman Mao's brilliant thought has a very great effect on promoting the development of productive forces. Judging from the situation of the factories in宣武 District, the change in ownership has played a great role in promoting the development of productive forces, but when the leadership style has not been completely changed, and there is still bureaucracy and subjectivism, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be fully utilized, and will still be greatly constrained. After the great blooming and contending, the thinking of the leading cadres became clear, and the work style changed. As a result, a new atmosphere quickly appeared.

Facts have proved that wherever the leadership style is good and the relationship between the leaders and the masses is good, the workers' enthusiasm is greater. Conversely, wherever the leadership style has not been greatly transformed, the workers' enthusiasm is not easy to mobilize. For example, in the Sanyang Flour Mill, the factory director is a cadre from a working-class background, and has a very good relationship with the workers. He has lived with the workers for a long time, and as long as he has time, he works with them. He is familiar with every worker in the factory, and also familiar with their families. Workers are willing to talk to him about anything. Although the equipment in this factory is very old, their product cost is low and the flour yield is high. Recently, the workers in this factory also solved the problem of grinding sweet potato flour, and the flour yield reached 97%. Another example is the Civilian Electrical Appliance Factory. The branch secretary originally had very little contact with the workers. During the rectification movement, the workers put up big-character posters criticizing him. He began to go to the workshops, but when he got to the workshops, he could only ask the workers questions, and sometimes he hindered the workers' production. As a result, the workers were still not satisfied and put up more big-character posters criticizing him. Later, he found the correct method, which was to participate in labor and apprentice himself to several workers. In this way, the relationship with the masses has changed significantly, and the workers put up big-character posters to praise him. Now the production of this factory has made a great leap forward, and the production plan has increased eightfold. The opposite situation is that we have a factory in our district with very good conditions, but because the leadership style has not been improved much, they do not contact the masses enough, they do not understand the situation in the workshops in a very specific way, they do not rely on the workers, and they do not support the workers' rationalization proposals. The enthusiasm of the workers in this factory has not yet been aroused.

In short, we have realized that Chairman Mao's thought is the correct guiding principle for handling the contradiction between leaders and the led. The key to correctly handling the contradiction between leaders and the led lies in the transformation of the leadership style, and the key to the transformation of the leadership style lies in correctly understanding Chairman Mao's thought, participating in production, participating in labor, and taking the lead in doing things. In this way, the contradiction can be properly resolved, and production and work can be developed rapidly.

    正确处理领导与被领导的矛盾
    中共北京市宣武区委员会书记　张旭
    领导与被领导之间的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾之一。从一年来的工作来看，按着毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”著作中所指示的方针，来正确处理领导与被领导之间的矛盾，有非常重要的意义。以前我们对这点是不明确的，毛主席的文章发表以后，我们领会的也很不够。后来中央提出用大字报、大鸣大放、大辩论的方法来解决这个矛盾。我们在按照中央的指示这样做的时候，也还预见不到这样作的好处。经过了一年，现在看的清楚了。
    按照毛主席的光辉思想来正确处理领导与被领导的矛盾，对推动生产力的发展效果非常大。从宣武区的工厂的情况来看，所有制的变化对推动生产力的发展起了很大的作用，但是当着领导作风没有彻底改变，还有官僚主义、主观主义的时候，群众的积极性就还不能充分的发挥出来，还会受到很大的束缚。经过大鸣大放以后，领导干部的思想通了，作风改变了。于是很快出现了新气象。
    事实证明，哪个地方的领导作风好，领导与群众的关系好，哪个地方的工人的干劲就大。相反，哪个地方的领导作风转变的不大，工人的干劲也就不容易发动起来。例如三羊面粉厂，厂长是个工人出身的干部，与工人关系很好，长期以来就和工人同住，并且只要有功夫就和工人一起劳动，他对厂里的每个工人都很熟悉，而且还熟悉他们的家属，工人们有什么事都愿找他去谈。这个厂的设备虽然很陈旧，但他们的产品成本却较低，出粉率也高。最近这个厂的工人又解决了磨白薯粉的问题，并且出粉率达到97％。又如民用电气厂，支部书记原来和工人的接触很少。整风中工人给他贴了大字报，他开始下了车间，但是到了车间也只能问问工人，有时反而妨碍工人的生产，结果工人还是不满意，又给他贴了大字报。后来他找到了正确的方法，就是参加劳动，并且拜了几个师傅。这样便和群众的关系有了显著的改变，工人又贴了大字报来表扬他。现在这个厂的生产有了很大跃进，生产计划增长了八倍。相反的情况是，我们区有个条件很好的厂，但是因为领导作风改进的不多，联系群众不够，对车间的情况了解的很不具体，他们也不大依靠工人，也不大支持工人的合理化建议，这个厂工人的干劲到现在还没有起来。
    总之，我们体会到毛主席的思想是处理领导与被领导之间矛盾的正确方针。正确处理领导与被领导之间矛盾的关键在于领导作风的转变，而领导作风转变的关键，又在于正确领会毛主席的思想，参加生产，参加劳动，带头干。这样，矛盾才能得到妥善的解决，生产、工作也才能迅速的发展。
