Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," recently published an editorial calling on the Japanese people to unite around the Communist Party, oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's suppression of the workers' movement, and strive to prevent the fascist offensive.

The editorial pointed out that the recent illegal suppression of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union ("Zentei") and the Japan Teachers' Union ("Nikkyoso") shows that the Kishida Nobusuke government has more systematically strengthened its reactionary rule. This suppression is by no means just a suppression of trade unions; it is a suppression of all working people, it threatens Japanese democracy, and reveals the sinister face of reactionary rule.

The editorial said that due to the development of the American economic crisis, the panic of overproduction in the capitalist world is deepening. The editorial emphasized that the ruling classes of some imperialist countries are attempting to use war and fascism once again to escape this crisis.

The editorial then pointed out that in the context of the Japanese economic recession, various economic and political contradictions are becoming more acute, workers are becoming increasingly dissatisfied, and the workers' movement is growing stronger. As these situations develop, the Kishida Nobusuke government and the monopoly capital groups' policies of plunder and suppression are becoming more and more blatant.

The editorial said that after the general election, the Japanese monopoly capital groups and the Liberal Democratic Party no longer conceal their attempts to consolidate reactionary rule on the existing basis, implement the "small constituency system," establish a long-term stable government, and revise the constitution, so as to openly submit to America's power politics, antagonize socialist countries, and actively prepare for an atomic strategic system.

The editorial called on the Japanese working class to stand at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle, widely arouse public opinion in defense of democracy, and unite all forces seeking peace and freedom around the working class. The editorial pointed out that only such a broad united action can prevent the fascistization of Japanese politics, police rule, and the revival of militarism, and can promote social progress and change the political direction of Japan.

    日共“赤旗报”号召日本人民
    团结在共产党周围
    阻止岸政府对工人运动的法西斯镇压
    据新华社17日讯　日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”最近发表社论，号召日本人民团结在共产党的周围，反对岸信介政府镇压工人运动，并且努力阻止法西斯主义的进攻。
    社论指出，最近全递信从业员工会（“全递”）和日本教职员工会（“日教组”）遭到的非法镇压表明，岸信介政府更加有系统地加强了反动统治。这种镇压绝非只是对工会的镇压，它是对全体劳动人民的镇压，它威胁了日本的民主，露出了反动统治的险恶面目。
    社论说，由于美国经济危机的发展，资本主义世界生产过剩的恐慌正在日益加深。社论强调指出，一些帝国主义国家的统治阶层正在企图再一次用战争和法西斯主义来摆脱这个危机。
    社论接着指出，日本在经济萧条的情况下，经济上和政治上的各种矛盾更加尖锐化，工人越来越感到不满，工人运动日益壮大，随着这些情况的发展，岸信介政府和垄断资本集团的掠夺和镇压政策也变得越来越露骨了。
    社论说，日本垄断资本集团和自由民主党在大选以后已经不再掩饰它们在现有基础上巩固反动统治、实施“小选举区制”、建立长期稳定政权和修改宪法的企图，以便公然屈从美国的实力政策，敌视社会主义各国，积极准备原子战略体制。
    社论号召日本工人阶级站在反法西斯斗争的最前列，广泛地唤起维护民主的舆论，并且把所有祈求和平与自由的力量团结在工人阶级的周围。社论指出，只有这样一个广泛的统一行动，才能阻止日本政治的法西斯化、警察统治和军国主义的复活，才能推动社会进步和改变日本的政治方向。
