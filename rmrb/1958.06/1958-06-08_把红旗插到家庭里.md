　　Planting the Red Flag in the Home
　　Yang Xuan
    Everywhere now is promoting the General Line, implementing the General Line. A few days ago, our street also conveyed the content of the General Line. I and the neighboring sisters-in-law and older sisters were talking about it enthusiastically, and everyone supported the General Line from the bottom of their hearts. They all said: The policy formulated by the Communist Party is good. To build socialism, it is not possible without going all out, aiming high, and implementing the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. We housewives must also dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to do, break superstitions, liberate our minds, and do everything in our power to serve the cause of socialist construction.
    However, I also heard some sisters-in-law say: "What can we housewives do? Sewing, cooking, and taking care of children. Apart from these, we can't do anything else." Indeed, some sisters-in-law have this idea, so they spend their days "three full meals and then a nap," not asking or caring about anything outside the gate. Although this situation has become less common after the rectification campaign, it still exists.
    "Can't do it," "can't manage it"—this is a self-defeating idea. In the past, housewives could only manage household affairs, and even household affairs were managed by the male "head of the family." This is an old rule that has been in place for many years. Now we should break this old rule. We should not only manage household affairs, but also care about national affairs, and implement the spirit of the General Line in every family.
    We housewives, if we want to do it, we can do anything, and we will do it well. Not long ago, many housewives in Beijing went to the countryside to support agricultural production, went to the Ming Tombs to wash clothes and cook for the comrades participating in labor, went to construction sites to participate in voluntary labor, organized resident service groups and street nurseries in the streets, and so on. These are all good ways to serve socialist construction. In the family, managing household affairs well and educating children well... is also beneficial to socialist construction.
    To plant the red flag of the General Line in every family, we must liberate our minds, cut off our sense of inferiority, and not think that we are inferior to others in everything. We must also dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. If we have any opinions about the government and cadres, we should boldly put them forward. If we see any phenomena that are not conducive to the implementation of the General Line, we should also boldly criticize them. In every family, everyone cares about family affairs, and everyone cares about national affairs, establishing harmonious, united, and mutually supportive new relationships in the family.
    Planting the red flag in the home is the responsibility of every family member, and first of all, it is the responsibility of us housewives.

### 把红旗插到家庭里

　　把红旗插到家庭里
　　杨萱
    现在到处都在宣传总路线，贯彻总路线。前些天，我们街道上也传达了总路线的内容。我和邻居的大嫂、大姐们在一起七嘴八舌地谈论，大伙儿从心眼里拥护总路线。都说：共产党制定的这条方针就是好，要建设社会主义，不鼓足干劲、力争上游，实行多快好省的方针，是不行的。我们家庭妇女们也要敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为，破除迷信，解放思想，尽一切力量为社会主义建设事业服务。
    可是，也听到有的大嫂说：“咱们家庭妇女能做什么事情啊？缝衣做饭看孩子，除了这些，别的事情咱们可干不了。”的确，有些大嫂因为有这种想法，所以她们整天“三饱一个倒”，大门以外的事不问也不管。这种情况经过整风虽然已经少见了，但是也还有。
    “干不了”、“管不了”，这是一种自暴自弃的想法。在过去，家庭妇女只能管家里的事，甚至就连家里的事务也都由那“一家之主”的男人来管。这是多年来的老规矩。现在应该打破这条老规矩，咱们不仅要管家里的事，而且也要关心国家大事，把总路线的精神贯彻到每个家庭里去。
    咱们家庭妇女，要干，什么事情就能干得了，而且还会干得好。不久以前，北京市的许多家庭妇女到农村去支援农业生产、到十三陵去为参加劳动的同志们洗衣服、做饭，到工地上去参加义务劳动，在街道上组织居民服务组、街道托儿站，等等。这些都是为社会主义建设服务的好办法。在家庭里，管理好家务，教育好孩子……对社会主义建设也是有利的。
    要把总路线的红旗插到每个家庭里去，咱们就要解放思想，砍掉自卑感，不要认为自己处处不如别人。咱们也要敢想、敢说、敢做。对政府和干部有什么意见就大胆地提出来，看到有什么不利于贯彻总路线的现象也大胆地提出批评。每个家庭里人人关心家事，人人也都关心国事，在家庭中建立和睦、团结、互助的新关系。
    把红旗插到家庭里去，这是每个家庭成员的责任，首先是咱们家庭妇女的责任。
