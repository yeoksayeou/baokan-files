Hefei Mining Institute Student Sun Maoke
Successfully Experiments with Oxygen Steelmaking

    Sun Maoke, a second-year student in the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Hefei Mining Institute, promoted the communist spirit of daring to think and act. He recently successfully experimented with "oxygen steelmaking" in the school's mechanical manufacturing factory. The steel produced, after microscopic analysis, mechanical performance tests, and cutting tests, proved to be of good quality and can completely replace high-speed steel.

    Sun Maoke is only twenty-five years old this year. He started working in the Jiawang Coal Mine electromechanical plant with his father and brother at the age of twelve. After liberation, he was promoted from apprentice to an ordinary foundry worker. In 1952, under the cultivation of the Party, he entered the coal mine workers' quick-study middle school. In 1955, he was admitted to Hefei Mining Institute. However, "steelmaking" was still "outside his field." Only in 1956, when he took a sick leave and participated in an "malleable cast iron" experiment in Jiawang Coal Mine. This was a great inspiration to Sun Maoke, making him realize that technology truly comes from production practice and not from blindly studying books.

    The successful experiment with oxygen steelmaking not only solves the steel shortage in the school's mechanical manufacturing factory, but also, because this steelmaking method is simple, convenient, and economical, opens up a favorable path for developing local industries to solve steel shortages.

    合肥矿业学院学生孙茂科
    试验吹氧炼钢成功
    合肥矿业学院机械制造系二年级学生孙茂科，发扬了共产主义敢想敢做的风格，最近在学校机械制造厂试验“吹氧炼钢”成功，炼出来的钢经过显微组织分析，机械性能试验和切削试验证明，钢的质量良好，完全可以代替高速钢。
    孙茂科今年才二十五岁，他十二岁起就跟父亲和哥哥在贾汪煤矿机电厂做工。解放后，他由学徒工升为一个普通的铸工，1952年他在党的培养下，又进入煤矿工人速成中学学习，1955年考进合肥矿业学院。但是“炼钢”对他来说，还是“外行”，只是在1956年他因病休学，在贾汪煤矿里参加过一次“可锻铸铁”的试验。这对孙茂科启发很大，使他认识到技术真正来源于生产实践，而不在于死啃书本。
    吹氧炼钢的试验成功，不仅解决学校机械制造厂的钢材困难，由于这种炼钢方法简单、方便又经济，为发展地方工业解决钢材的困难开辟了一条有利的途径。
