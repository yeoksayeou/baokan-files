	Motor Vehicle Train Transportation of Lumber
	Daily Records Being Broken
	The truck drivers transporting lumber in the Greater Khingan Range forest area have been using advanced train-style transportation methods and have recently continuously set new records for truck lumber hauling and truck train carrying capacity.

	On June 8th, Yang Zhenqi, a driver from the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, towed three four-axle, sixteen-wheel heavy-duty trailers, setting a new record by transporting 105.63 cubic meters of logs in a single trip (each cubic meter weighs approximately one ton). Subsequently, Zhao Jingguo, a driver from the Tulihe Forestry Bureau, quickly caught up, towing seven two-axle, eight-wheel trailers on the 14th, transporting 110.62 cubic meters of logs in a single trip, surpassing Yang Zhenqi. Yang Dezhong, a driver from the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, was not to be outdone. After working hard day and night, he towed four four-axle, sixteen-wheel heavy-duty trailers on the 19th, transporting 143.76 cubic meters of logs in a single trip, surpassing Zhao Jingguo again.

	These new records were all created using Czechoslovakian-made Tatra trucks. The maximum power of the Tatra truck is 175 horsepower, and its towing capacity is very large. However, in the past, it was not fully utilized because the competent authorities stipulated that this type of truck could only carry one trailer, with a towing load of 22 tons, so drivers were afraid to pull more. But after the workers emancipated their minds under the encouragement of the General Line, they broke through the conservative targets. The method they adopted was to add more trailers, making the truck a train, without excessively increasing the weight of the trucks and trailers and ensuring safety. (Attached picture)

### 运材汽车列车化  载运纪录日日新

    运材汽车列车化
    载运纪录日日新
    大兴安岭林区运输木材的汽车司机们，采用先进的列车式运输法，最近连续创造了汽车运材量和汽车列车载运量的新纪录。
    6月8日，西尼气林业局司机杨振起拖带三个四轴十六轮重型拖车，创造了一次运原木一百零五点六三立方公尺（每立方公尺约重一吨）的新纪录。随后，图里河林业局司机赵经国急起猛追，在14日拖带七个双轴八轮拖车，一次运原木一百一十点六二立方公尺，赶过了杨振起。西尼气林业局司机杨德忠也不甘示弱，他苦战一昼夜，在19日拖带四个四轴十六轮重型拖车，一次运原木一百四十三点七六立方公尺，又赶过了赵经国。
    这些新纪录，都是采用捷克斯洛伐克产的塔脱拉大汽车创造的。塔脱拉汽车的最大功率为一百七十五马力，它的牵引能力很大，但是过去未能充分发挥，原因是主管部门规定这种汽车只能带一个拖车，牵引载重量为二十二吨，因此司机们不敢多拉。但是职工们在总路线的鼓舞下解放思想以后，把保守的指标冲破了。他们采用的办法，是在不过多增加汽车及拖车载重量和保证安全的情况下，多带拖车，使汽车列车化。（附图片）
