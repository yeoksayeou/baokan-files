Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th – Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, accepted an appointment on the 9th to serve as a professor of political science at Shanxi Normal College. On the same day, he conveyed the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to the entire faculty, staff, and students of the college.

Tao Lujia called on all teachers, students, and staff to exert their utmost efforts, strive for advancement, break down superstitions, emancipate their minds, and establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.

Tao Lujia also discussed the teaching reform work currently underway at the college. He said that carrying out teaching reform is a requirement of the General Line. In the past few years, we have achieved certain results in teaching work, but it is undeniable that in the past teaching, there were indeed many dogmatic and bourgeois elements. He demanded that educators resolutely implement the policy of linking with production, linking with reality, and linking with the masses. Tao Lujia finally called on the teachers to make great breakthroughs and establish new systems in the teaching reform, and thoroughly achieve victory in the teaching reform.

In the past two days, Wei Heng and Chi Biqing, Secretaries of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, respectively conveyed the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to the teachers and students of Shanxi Medical College and Taiyuan Institute of Technology.
