    Taking the Shortest Route, Spending the Least Money, Facilitating Production and Benefiting the Masses
    Tangshan Prefecture Organizes Straight-Line Commodity Transportation
    (Our Report) The commercial departments of Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, have set an example for organizing commodity circulation in a faster, better, and more economical way by eliminating redundant links and implementing straight-line transportation in the management of live pigs and fresh eggs. Preliminary estimates indicate that this reform will save 1 million yuan annually.
    The Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce recently held an on-site meeting in Changli to introduce this experience to representatives from the commercial departments of all prefectures in the province. At the meeting, after representatives from Tangshan Prefecture introduced the process of implementing straight-line transportation after delegating business operations, they issued a proposal to the entire province, guaranteeing the full implementation of direct transport by June 15, and aiming to have direct transport account for 95% of the total transport volume between June and December.
    Starting on April 1 this year, the commercial departments of Tangshan Prefecture merged the original live pig purchasing stations and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, with the purchase of pigs and eggs being entirely the responsibility of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and their affiliated distribution stores. In areas where there were too few original distribution stores, additional purchasing points were appropriately established. All cadres were used uniformly to achieve a combination of purchasing and selling. Every cadre who went to the countryside to deliver goods or purchase waste products was responsible for purchasing pigs and eggs. As a result, the number of purchasing points in the entire prefecture increased from the original 77 to nearly 1,000, and the number of purchasing cadres increased from over 1,000 to nearly 10,000. The distance for the masses to sell pigs was reduced to no more than five *hua li* (approximately 2.5 kilometers), basically realizing that neither selling pigs nor buying meat required leaving the township or commune, greatly benefiting the masses.
    Cutting out redundant links and organizing straight-line transportation are effective measures to achieve faster, better, and more economical commodity circulation. In the past, after the grassroots units of the Tangshan Prefecture commercial departments purchased pigs and eggs, they first transported them to the warehouses of the county supply and marketing cooperatives for feeding and storage, and then the county cooperatives would transfer them to large cities or mining areas. Such roundabout transportation caused significant waste and losses. For example, the Hanzizhen area of Luanxian County is only 25 *hua li* (approximately 12.5 kilometers) away from the Tangshan East Mining Area, but the purchased live pigs had to be driven eastward for 95 *hua li* (approximately 47.5 kilometers) to the Luanxian county warehouse for consolidation, and then transferred from the county warehouse to the Tangshan East Mining Area, taking a 60 *hua li* (approximately 30 kilometers) detour westward. Now, it has been changed to direct transportation from Hanzizhen to the Tangshan East Mining Area, greatly shortening the transport distance and time, saving more than two yuan per pig in expenses. Due to the reduction of operating links, direct handover and settlement between the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and the receiving units, without going through county-level transit, county-level commercial departments can jump out of the simple business circle to strengthen production guidance and investigation and research work, properly arrange purchase, sales, and allocation plans according to production and sales conditions and natural circulation patterns, and better implement policies.
    As a result of the above measures, in the month and a half from April 1 to May 15, the total number of live pigs purchased in the entire prefecture increased by 30% compared to the same period last year; the total number of eggs purchased in the entire prefecture increased more than twofold compared to the first quarter and the same period last year. The implementation of straight-line transportation has greatly shortened the distance and time of commodities in the circulation process. According to preliminary calculations from 36 grassroots cooperatives, this year alone, it can save more than 580,000 yuan in freight, more than 40,000 yuan in interest expenses, and more than 5 million *jin* (approximately 2.5 million kilograms) of feed for pigs during transportation. At the same time, it has also reduced commodity losses, basically achieving "happy pigs and fresh eggs."

    走最短的路　花最少的钱　便利生产便利群众
    唐山专区组织商品直线运输
    本报讯　河北省唐山专区商业部门在生猪、鲜蛋经营中，去掉多余环节，实行直线运输，为多快好省地组织商品流通树立了榜样。据初步估计，这一改革全年可节约费用一百万元。
    河北省商业厅最近在昌黎召开现场会议，向全省各专区商业部门代表介绍这个经验。会上唐山专区代表介绍下放业务开展直线运输的经过之后，向全省发出倡议书，保证在6月15日以前实行全面直运，要在6月至12月内使直运货物达到总运输量的95％。
    从今年4月1日开始，唐山专区商业部门把原有的生猪收购站和基层供销社合并起来，猪和蛋的收购工作完全由基层供销社和所属分销店负责。原有分销店过少的地区，又适当增设了收购点。所有干部统一使用，做到收售结合，每个下乡送货或收购废品的干部，都负责收购猪蛋。这样，全专区的收购点就由原来的七十七个增加到将近一千个，收购干部由一千余名增加到将近一万名，群众卖猪的路程缩短为不超过五华里，基本上实现了卖猪、买肉都不出乡、社，大大便利了群众。
    砍掉多余环节，组织直线运输，是实现多快好省地组织商品流通的有效措施。过去，唐山专区商业部门的基层单位把猪蛋收购进来之后，先运到县供销社的仓库饲养保管，然后再由县社调运大城市或矿区。这样迂回运输，造成的浪费损失很大。例如：滦县的榛子镇一带，距唐山东矿区只有二十五华里，但收购来的生猪要向东赶运九十五华里到滦县县库集中，然后由县库调给唐山东矿区，再向西走六十华里的回头路。现在改为由榛子镇直接赶运到唐山东矿区，运输的里程和时间大大缩短，每头猪即可节省开支两块多钱。由于减少了经营环节，由基层供销社同调入单位直接交接和结算，不再通过县级中转，县级商业部门就可以跳出单纯业务圈子，来加强生产指导和调查研究工作，根据产销情况和自然流转规律，妥善安排购销调拨计划，更好地贯彻执行政策。
    由于采取了上述措施，从4月1日到5月15日的一个半月中，全专区收购生猪比去年同期收购量增加30％；全专区收购鸡蛋比第一季度和去年同期收购量都增加了两倍多。实行直线运输，大大缩短了商品在流通过程中的里程和时间，据三十六个基层社的初步计算，今年就可节约运费五十八万余元、利息支出四万余元和途中喂猪饲料五百余万斤。同时，还降低了商品的损耗，基本上做到了“猪欢蛋鲜。”
