　　One-Legged Director Delivers Loan in the Rainy Night

　　The rain had been falling continuously for two days, making the roads in the countryside particularly muddy and difficult to travel. As it was getting dark, Director Gu of the Gugao Township Credit Cooperative in Taixian County received a note from the accountant of the Zhennan Agricultural Cooperative, saying: "Old Mrs. Gu of the Second Production Team urgently needs to borrow three yuan to buy food." Director Gu is a disabled veteran, with only one leg, and walks with a crutch. But he thought of Old Mrs. Gu, who is over sixty years old, and the heavy rain outside, the dark night, and the long distance. How could he let the old woman come to the credit cooperative to get a loan? So he took three yuan, and leaning on his crutch, he walked more than seven li through the heavy rain to Old Mrs. Gu's house, and handed the money to Old Mrs. Gu in person. At this time, Old Mrs. Gu was so moved that tears streamed down her face, and she held Director Gu's hand for a long time, unable to speak.

　　独脚主任雨夜送贷款
    雨连续地下了两天，乡村里的道路格外泥泞难走。天快黑的时候，泰县顾高乡信用社顾主任接到镇南农业社会计写来一张条子，上面说：“第二生产队顾老太太急需借三元钱买口粮。”顾主任是一个荣军，只剩下一只脚扶着拐杖走路。但他想到顾老太太是一个六十多岁的老人，外面下着这么大的雨，天黑路远，怎能让老太太跑到信用社来拿贷款呢？于是他拿了三元钱，拄着拐杖冒着大雨一拐一拐地走了七里多路来到顾老太太的家里，把钱当面交给顾老太太。这时，顾老太太感动的流下泪来，握着顾主任的手半天说不出话来。
