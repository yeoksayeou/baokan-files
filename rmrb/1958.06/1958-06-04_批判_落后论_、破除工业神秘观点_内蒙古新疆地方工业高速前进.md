Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 3rd: The local industries of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are advancing rapidly, with more than forty new factories and mines being completed every day. In the eighty-five days from the convening of the Autonomous Region's Industrial Conference to May 25th this year, Inner Mongolia has already had more than three thousand nine hundred new factories and mines built and put into production by banners, counties, townships, and communes.

	Vigorously implementing the General Line, seriously criticizing "Backwardness Theory," and breaking down the mystical view of running industry are important reasons for the rapid development of local industries in Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its Sixth Plenary Session in April, systematically criticized the various erroneous ideas that emphasized Inner Mongolia's economic backwardness, poor natural conditions, weak technical forces, and lack of work experience, and thus could not run industry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, thus strengthening the confidence in running industry on a large scale. Wuchuan County, Ulanqab League, which has an extremely weak industrial base, has raised 1.5 million yuan in funds from the masses. This year, the county will set up 237 factories and mines, and 13 factories and mines have already been built and put into production. Mushroom Qi Township in Butha Banner, Hulunbuir League, adopted methods of making do with available resources, supporting each other, relying on the masses, self-reliance, and simultaneous planning and construction. Without spending a penny of state money, it built a combined factory including power generation, wine making, grain and rice, and feed processing in twenty-six days. On the Ordos prairie, after vigorously criticizing the theory of regional backwardness and breaking down the mystical view of running industry, more than 570 new factories and mines have also appeared here.

	The newly built factories and mines put into production in various parts of Inner Mongolia have already begun to play a supporting role in the great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production. The feed processing factory run by the "May 3rd" agricultural cooperative in Chifeng County, Zhaowuda League, produces 500 jin of feed every day, solving the feed difficulties of 150 pigs. The granular fertilizer processing plant newly built by the Heping vegetable production cooperative in Zhalantun Town, Butha Banner, Hulunbuir League, produces more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per day, solving the fertilizer difficulties within the cooperative.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 3rd: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will set up more than 460 various factories this year. By the end of the year, more than 20 major pastoral counties can have power stations, flour mills, oil presses, and milk powder factories, etc. in every county.

	These more than 20 major pastoral counties have now formulated plans for developing pastoral area industry this year, and the entire party and people are mobilizing to raise funds, survey and design factory sites and mineral deposits. These pastoral areas, which have a very weak industrial base, will first develop power, food processing, and agricultural and animal husbandry production tool repair, fertilizer and other industries this year. The small power stations planned to be built this year in these pastoral counties number fifty. After these power stations are built, each pastoral county will have one to three power stations. In addition to the more than forty fixed and mobile milk powder and cream factories established by the county's investment this year, many pastoral cooperatives will also raise funds to establish a number of milk powder processing plants. After these milk powder factories are built, the large amount of fresh milk and fresh goat milk wasted in the past in pastoral areas will be processed into milk powder, increasing the income of herdsmen and meeting the needs of other places for milk powder.

　　批判“落后论”、破除工业神秘观点
    内蒙古新疆地方工业高速前进
    据新华社呼和浩特3日电  内蒙古自治区的地方工业正以每天建成四十多个新厂矿的速度向前猛进。今年从自治区工业会议召开到5月25日的八十五天中，内蒙古已经有三千九百多个旗、县、乡、社办的新厂矿建成并投入生产。
    大力贯彻总路线，认真批判“落后论”和破除办工业的神秘观点，是内蒙古地方工业迅速发展的重要原因。中共内蒙古自治区委员会在4月召开的第六次全体委员扩大会议，对那些强调内蒙古经济落后、自然条件不好、技术力量较差和工作经验不多，因而不能多快好省地大办工业的种种错误思想，进行了系统的批判，坚定了大办工业的信心。工业基础极为薄弱的乌兰察布盟武川县，群众筹集的资金已达一百五十万元。今年这个县将要办起二百三十七个厂矿，现在已经建成并投入生产的有十三个厂矿。呼伦贝尔盟布特哈旗蘑菇气乡，采用因陋就简、相互支援、依靠群众、自力更生和边规划边兴建的办法，没花国家一文钱，在二十六天中建成了一座包括发电、制酒、粮米和饲料加工的联合工厂。在鄂尔多斯草原上，大力批判了地区落后论和破除办工业的神秘观点后，这里也出现了五百七十多个新建厂矿。
    内蒙古各地投入生产的新建厂矿，已经开始对工农牧业生产大跃进起到支援作用。昭乌达盟赤峰县“五三”农业社兴办的饲料加工厂，每天生产饲料五百斤，解决了一百五十口猪的饲料困难。呼伦贝尔盟布特哈旗扎兰屯镇和平蔬菜生产合作社新近建成的颗粒肥料加工厂，日产肥料一万多斤，解决了社内的肥料困难。
    新华社乌鲁木齐3日电  新疆维吾尔自治区今年将要办起四百六十多个各类工厂。到年底，二十多个主要牧业县就可以县县有电站、有面粉厂、榨油厂和奶粉厂等。
    这二十多个主要牧业县，目前都已制定了今年发展牧区工业的规划，正在全党、全民动手筹集资金、勘测设计厂址和矿藏。这些工业基础十分薄弱的牧区今年将首先发展动力、食品加工和农牧业生产工具修配、化肥等工业。这些牧业县今年计划兴建的小型发电站，有五十个，这些发电站建成后，每个牧业县就有一个到三个电站。各牧业县今年除由县投资建立四十多个固定和流动奶粉厂、奶油厂外，许多牧业社还要自筹资金建立一批奶粉加工厂。这些奶粉厂建成后，牧区过去浪费掉的大量鲜牛奶、鲜羊奶将被加工成奶粉，增加牧民收入和满足外地对奶粉的需要。
