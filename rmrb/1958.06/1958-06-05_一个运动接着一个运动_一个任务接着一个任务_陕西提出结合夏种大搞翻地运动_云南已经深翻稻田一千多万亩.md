One Movement Following Another, One Task Following Another
	Shaanxi Proposes Combining Summer Planting with a Large-Scale Land Turning Movement
	Yunnan Has Already Deeply Plowed Over Ten Million Mu of Paddy Fields

	(By Our Newspaper) Shaanxi Province is currently holding on-site meetings to launch a large-scale iron shovel land turning movement in conjunction with summer harvesting and planting. This spring, the province originally planned to deeply plow three million mu of land with iron shovels. After research by various regions, it has recently been proposed to deeply plow over five million mu. Calculated at an increase of more than 30% per mu, this item alone could increase wheat production in the province by approximately 500 million jin next year.
	Currently, farmers in various counties in Guanzhong are conducting on-site observations to study the benefits of iron shovel land turning and to learn and exchange experiences. Last year, Guanzhong counties deeply plowed approximately one million mu of cultivated land with iron shovels, nearly half of which was planted with wheat. This year, these wheat crops are growing particularly well, which has greatly educated the masses during the observations. For example, in the Wua, Xuguang, and Kuaile agricultural cooperatives in Lantian County, the wheat grown on land turned with iron shovels last year yielded an average of 30% to 100% more per mu than wheat grown with old-fashioned plows. In Shaoling Agricultural Cooperative in Chang'an County, two mu of land turned with iron shovels in 1955 still has very strong fertility. This year, the wheat in this plot yields approximately 600 jin per mu, while the nearby plot plowed with old plows yields 260 jin per mu. Farmers have seen many vivid and concrete comparisons, which has greatly increased their interest in iron shovel land turning.
	Currently, farmers in various counties are preparing tools and arranging labor. Lantian County has proposed a land turning task of "one and a half mu per laborer." It has already organized 80,000 laborers to turn 120,000 mu of land with iron shovels within ten days after the summer harvest. Recently, the masses in Hu County launched a major debate on the question of "whether iron shovel land turning is cost-effective." After the debate, farmers throughout the county proposed to turn 100,000 mu of land with iron shovels during the summer planting period to ensure that the annual grain output reaches the leaping forward target of 500 jin per mu next year. Lintong, Weinan, Dali, and other counties have formulated plans to deeply plow approximately 200,000 mu of land in each county, striving to deeply plow all cultivated land in the county with iron shovels once in three to five years.
	Most areas of Shaanxi Province belong to the Loess Plateau, which has a thick soil layer and is suitable for deep plowing. In particular, the Guanzhong area has more than 20 million mu of summer and autumn fallow land each year, with over one million laborers. Local people have been using iron shovels to turn the land for more than 100 years. This method of land turning generally reaches a depth of eight inches to one foot two inches. It not only loosens the soil but also preserves moisture and water, and it can also eliminate weeds and pests. According to past experience, summer land turning must be carried out immediately after the previous crop is harvested and completed before entering the dog days of summer. However, this period is also a time of intense agricultural activity. To resolve the contradiction between agricultural work and labor, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have now formulated labor plans based on the deep plowing tasks, classifying and ranking the agricultural work in the commune during this period according to light, heavy, urgent, and slow. They have established various professional teams (groups), drawing out all the female labor in the commune to be responsible for cotton field management, some male labor and semi-labor to be responsible for delivering manure and plowing, and the remaining strong male labor to form iron shovel land turning teams to rush to turn the land.

    (By Our Newspaper) Over fourteen million mu of land in Yunnan Province has undergone a major transformation this year. Deeply plowing the land is a rice production increase experience passed down through generations by farmers in inland Yunnan Province. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China once required all regions to take deep digging and deep plowing as one of the main measures this year. Because farmers in many areas have personally seen or experienced the benefits of deeply plowing fields, and many townships and communes also have their own field digging experience, this measure is easily accepted by farmers of all ethnic groups. During spring plowing and production, although all parts of the province generally felt the pressure of labor shortages, the determination of Party committees at all levels and the masses of all ethnic groups to deeply plow the land remained unshaken. In April and May, millions of laborers throughout the province, carrying luggage, grain, and cooking utensils, used resolute actions of eating in the fields and living in the fields to make a great fuss about land turning day and night. Many areas put forward slogans such as "No planting seedlings until one foot is exceeded" and "Eliminate low-yielding fields below 600 jin," and strictly inspected the depth and quality of the excavation. Twenty-six agricultural cooperatives in Yao'an County fought hard for seven days and nights to deeply plow more than 32,000 mu of slab fields. According to a general survey by the county party committee, this measure can at least increase the average yield per mu by 100 jin. In Chengjiang, Eshan and other counties, paddy fields were generally dug to more than one foot; in many places such as the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the Dehong Dai Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, clods several feet high were also piled up in the fields for sun exposure. By mid-May, more than 14 million mu of paddy fields throughout the province had undergone a major transformation, with the soil layer generally deepened by one inch to four inches compared to previous years. The depth of sweet potato and sugarcane fields reached more than one foot, and rice reached about one foot.
	Due to a series of measures such as deep plowing, increased fertilizer application, and improved cultivation techniques, although Yunnan Province encountered a drought phenomenon that had not occurred in recent years, after a large-scale drought resistance struggle, the early rice in most areas still grew unprecedentedly vigorously this year. Generally, three to five days after transplanting, it began to turn green, and in many counties such as Quxi, Jianshui, and Chengjiang, the effective tillering of rice increased compared to previous years. At present, the early rice in many areas has completed tillering and is beginning to round the stems. Farmers of all ethnic groups are full of infinite confidence in this year's rice production increase. Experience in various places has proved that deep digging can make the fields fully exposed to the sun, thicken the soil layer, loosen the soil, increase the temperature and effective nutrients of the soil; it can promote the development of rice roots, expand the nutrient surface, and make the soil have a suitable temperature for rice growth. At the same time, deep plowing and sun exposure can greatly eliminate weeds and overwintering insects. According to investigations and comparisons by local party committees and agricultural scientists, it has been proven that for fields with stickier soil, deep digging by one to two inches can generally increase the average yield of rice by 50 to 150 jin per mu. After deep digging in Lufeng County, the rice was about five inches higher than that without digging; last year, the average yield of rice in the province was more than 400 jin per mu, while more than ten counties in the deep digging area became high-yield counties with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu.

    一个运动接着一个运动　一个任务接着一个任务
    陕西提出结合夏种大搞翻地运动
    云南已经深翻稻田一千多万亩
    本报讯　陕西省各地正召开现场会议，将结合夏收夏种开展大搞铁锨翻地运动。今年春，全省原预计用铁锨深翻地三百万亩，经过各地研究之后，最近提出要深翻五百多万亩。按每亩以增产30％以上计算，仅此一项明年全省就可增产小麦约五亿多斤。
    现在关中各县农民正进行现场观摩，研究铁锨翻地的好处，学习和交流经验。去年关中各县用铁锨深翻耕地约有一百多万亩，其中有将近一半的地种植小麦，今年这些麦子都长得特别好，观摩中给群众起了很大的教育作用。如蓝田县五爱、旭光、快乐三个农业社，去年用铁锨翻过的地，麦子长得比用旧式犁耕种麦子每亩平均产量高出30％至一倍。长安县少陵农业社，1955年用铁锨翻过的二亩地，至今地力很壮。今年这块地里的麦子，每亩产小麦六百斤左右，附近用老犁耕过的这块地，每亩产小麦二百六十斤。农民们亲眼看到这许多生动具体的对比事实，对铁锨翻地发生了很大的兴趣。
    目前，各县农民正在准备工具，安排劳力。蓝田县提出“一个劳力一亩半”的翻地任务，现已组织好八万个劳力，在夏收后的十天内，要用铁锨翻地十二万亩。鄠县群众最近就“铁锨翻地是否合算”的问题展开了一次大辩论，经过辩论后，全县农民提出在夏种期间，要用铁锨翻地十万亩，保证明年全年粮食实现五百斤的跃进指标。临潼、渭南、大荔等县制定计划，确定每县深翻地二十万亩左右，争取三五年内把全县所有耕地用铁锨深翻一次。
    陕西省大部地区属于黄土高原，土层较厚，适于深耕，特别是关中地区每年约有两千万多亩夏秋休闲地，有一百多万劳力。当地群众用铁锨翻地已有一百多年的历史。这种翻地的方法，一般深到八寸至一尺二寸。既疏松了土壤，又能保墒蓄水，还可消灭杂草和虫害等。根据以往的经验，夏翻地必须在前茬作物收割后立即进行，争取入伏以前完成。但这时期也正是农事活动紧张的时候，为了解决农活和劳力之间的矛盾，各地农业社目前已根据深翻地任务制定了劳力规划，把全社在这一时期的农活按照轻、重、缓、急分类排队，成立各种专业队（组），抽出全社的妇女劳力负责棉田管理，部分男劳力和半劳力负责送粪犁地，其余强壮的男劳力组成铁锨翻地队，突击翻地。

    本报讯　云南省今年一千四百多万亩土地大翻身。深翻土地，是云南省内地农民世代相传的水稻增产经验。中共云南省委曾要求各地把深挖深耕作为今年的主要措施之一。由于许多地区的农民亲眼见到或亲身体验到深翻田地的好处，不少乡社也有自己的挖田经验，这一措施很易为各族农民接受。在春耕生产中，全省各地虽然普遍感到劳动力紧张，但各级党委和各族群众深翻土地的决心，仍然没有动摇。4、5月份，全省就有数以百万计的劳动大军，背着行李、粮食和锅灶，用吃在田间、住在田间的坚决行动，日夜大闹土地翻身。许多地区提出了“不超过一尺不栽秧”、“消灭六百斤以下的低产田”的口号，并对翻挖的深度和质量进行了严格的检查。姚安县二十六个农业社苦战七昼夜就深翻了三万二千多亩板田。据县委普查，这一措施至少可使每亩田平均增产一百斤。澄江、峨山等县的稻田普遍挖到一尺以上；楚雄彝族自治州和德宏傣族景颇族自治州等不少地方还在田里垒成几尺高的垡子堆，进行曝晒。到5月中旬，全省已有一千四百多万亩稻田，实行了大翻身，土层一般比往年加深了一寸至四寸。红薯和甘蔗地达到了一尺以上，水稻达到一尺左右。
    由于采取了深翻、增施肥料和改进栽培技术等一系列措施，云南省今年虽遇到了几年来没有过的干旱现象，经过大规模的抗旱斗争，大部地区今年的早稻，仍然生长得空前旺盛。一般在插秧以后三至五天，就开始返青，曲溪、建水、澄江等不少县的水稻，有效分蘖都比往年增多。目前，不少地区早稻已经分蘖完毕，开始圆秆。各族农民对今年水稻的增产，充满着无限的信心。各地经验证明，深挖可以使田地晒得透，使土层加厚、土壤疏松、增加土壤的温度和有效养分；可以促进水稻根系的发达、营养面扩大，并使土壤具有适宜水稻生长的温度。同时，深翻晒透可以大量消灭杂草和越冬虫。据各地党委和农业科学人员的调查对比，证明土质较粘的田地，深挖一至二寸，一般每亩可以平均增产稻谷五十到一百五十斤。禄丰县经过深挖以后，稻谷就比没有挖过的高五寸左右；去年全省水稻平均亩产四百多斤，而实行深挖的地区，有十多县成为了平均亩产六百斤以上的高产县。
