Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 10th: The Indonesian Army Information Service announced today that government forces in North Sulawesi recently recovered Limbo’to, northwest of Gorontalo, and the rebels there fled north.

In the Poso region of Central Sulawesi, pro-government guerrillas have recovered Ondae, Domba, and Tomoto. The guerrillas destroyed a number of rebel vehicles, and forty-seven rebels surrendered to them.

Lieutenant Colonel Yono Sewoyo, Chief of Staff of the Eastern Indonesian Liaison Command, said on Makassar Radio on the evening of the 9th that government troops are now advancing towards Gema, an important port thirty kilometers southeast of Manado in North Sulawesi, and will soon liberate the city. The importance of Gema Port is second only to the nearby Bitung Port.

Currently, most of the ports in central and northern Sulawesi available to the rebels have been recovered by government forces. The airspace and territorial waters of northwestern Sulawesi are also under the control of the government air force and navy, which is making it increasingly difficult for the rebels, who depend on foreign support to survive.

In West Sumatra, government forces are mopping up the remnants of the rebels. In the past few days, small groups of rebels have been constantly surrendering to government forces. It is speculated that the rebel leaders Husein, Syafruddin, and their remnants are now scattered in the mountains near Padang and Bukittinggi, and in the Kerinci area south of West Sumatra, conducting "guerrilla warfare". Simbolon may be harassing the border area of ​​Sibolga and West Sumatra.

A spokesman for the First Military District of North Sumatra announced that the strength of the Nainggolan rebels in the Sibolga area is now only one-tenth of what it used to be, and they have fled into the jungle, occasionally coming out to harass.

Local newspapers point out that as the rebel group faces its demise, the United States is doing everything possible to assist the remaining reactionaries, attempting to make the Indonesian government "soften" its attitude towards the rebel group; at the same time, the rebels are still operating in the government-recovered areas, attempting to regain their positions in local governments so that they can continue to carry out sabotage activities from within. However, the Indonesian government and army have taken a firm stand to eliminate the rebels.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to a report from Tokyo by the Associated Press on the 8th, Syngman Rhee is secretly plotting to send South Korean "volunteer soldiers" to Indonesia to help the rebels there.

The report said that Choi Deok-shin, the Syngman Rhee group's "ambassador" to South Vietnam, recently made a special visit to Singapore on his way back to Saigon from Seoul. Insiders said that he went to Singapore to arrange the dispatch of South Korean "volunteer soldiers" with the Indonesian rebels there.

It has been previously reported that Syngman Rhee has repeatedly and openly clamored for interference in Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚政府军连克要地
    向万鸦老东南格马港推进
    美联社透露李承晚密谋派兵援助叛乱集团
    新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处今天宣布，北苏拉威西的政府军最近收复了哥伦打洛西北的林波多，那里的叛军向北逃走。
    在中苏拉威西的波梭地区，忠于政府的游击队已经收复了翁代、多姆巴都和托莫托。游击队击毁了叛军的一批车辆，有四十七名叛军向他们投降。
    东印度尼西亚联络司令部参谋长约诺塞沃约中校9日晚在望加锡电台上说，政府军队现在正向北苏拉威西的万鸦老东南三十公里的重要港口格马前进，不久就会解放这个城市。格马港的重要性仅次于附近的比东港。
    目前，在苏拉威西中部和北部可供叛军使用的大多数港口都已经被政府军队收复。苏拉威西北部的领空和领海也处于政府空军和海军的控制下，这种控制使得依靠外国支援过活的叛乱分子的困难越来越大了。
    在西苏门答腊，政府军正在那里对叛军残余进行扫荡。在过去的数天中，不断有小股叛军向政府军投降。据推测，叛军首领侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁以及他们的残部现在分散在巴东和武吉丁宜附近的山区以及西苏门答腊以南的葛林芝地区“打游击”。西姆波朗可能在打板奴里边界地区和西苏门答腊进行骚扰。
    北苏门答腊的第一军区发言人宣布，打板奴里地区的奈恩戈兰叛军的实力现在只剩下十分之一，他们已经逃入丛林，有时还出来进行骚扰。
    这里报纸指出，当叛乱集团面临末日的时候，美国正在尽一切努力协助残余的反动分子，企图使印度尼西亚政府“缓和”它对叛乱集团的态度；同时，叛乱分子还正在政府的收复区内进行活动，企图重新取得在地方政府中的地位，这样他们就可以从内部继续进行破坏活动。然而，印度尼西亚政府和陆军采取了坚定态度来消灭叛乱分子。
    据新华社10日讯　据美联社8日从东京发出的一则消息透露，李承晚正在密谋派遣南朝鲜“志愿军”到印度尼西亚去帮助那里的叛军。
    这则消息说，李承晚集团驻南越的“大使”崔德新最近在从汉城回西贡的途中特别访问了新加坡。了解内幕的人士说，他到新加坡去是为了同在那里的印度尼西亚叛乱分子安排派遣南朝鲜“志愿军”的问题。
    以前曾经报道，李承晚曾经一再公开叫嚣要干涉印度尼西亚。
