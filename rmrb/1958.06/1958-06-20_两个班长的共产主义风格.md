    The representatives attending the Beijing Military Region activists' meeting were very interested in the "radio station" (field telephone) presented to the conference by Qi Zhanhui, the telephone squad leader of the heavy artillery company, which had no vacuum tubes and did not use dry cell batteries. It is about the same size as the domestically produced "Type 71 field telephone" and even the devices on the outer shell are similar. But it is not a replica, but a real creation. The parts on it are made of all sorts of things like plywood, thumbtacks, pushpins, broken flashlights, bullet casings, and tin foil from cigarette boxes. When used by signal corps soldiers, it can be used to talk within a range of thirty kilometers to transmit the commander's orders.
    This "radio station" was created by Qi Zhanhui, the wire telephone squad leader, and Shen Rongtai, the wireless telephone squad leader. They have already made more than a dozen of them for the signal corps to use for training. The first "radio station" cost only 36 cents; the later ones improved some of the parts, and each one cost only two or three yuan.
    Qi Zhanhui described to reporters the process of their bold creation of this "radio station." This spring, facing the situation of the great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland, the soldiers of the heavy artillery company's telephone squad proposed that everyone should be a "dual-capable" signal corps soldier—learning to use both wire and wireless telephones. However, the two telephone squads (wire telephone squad and wireless telephone squad) only had a few field telephones, and there were not enough materials for the number of people, which made the two squad leaders, Qi Zhanhui and Shen Rongtai, feel embarrassed. They thought: If there were a few more radio station field telephones, and these field telephones would not be easily worn or damaged, and they did not need dry cell batteries, and the signal corps soldiers could sit in front of the "radio station" every day to study and train, and it would not consume much electricity, how great would that be!
    Could they make such a radio station themselves? The two of them had a meeting and both had this idea, but they were a little timid. In terms of education, Qi Zhanhui only had a second-grade elementary school education; Shen Rongtai had not even exceeded the level of a junior elementary school graduate. In terms of military knowledge, Qi Zhanhui had only been in the army for two years, and Shen Rongtai had been in the army for less than three years. Before joining the army, they were both farmers, so how could they make a technologically complex field telephone? However, when they thought: Farmers have diverted river water to the mountains to realize water conservancy, so how can we not dare to try? So, they were determined to create a "radio station" field telephone without vacuum tubes and without dry cell batteries that could be used for both practice and actual communication.
    How to do it? They thought that if the communication followed the telephone principle and the operation followed the field telephone principle, it might be possible to make it. So, the two of them divided the work: Qi Zhanhui made the induction coil for communication, and Shen Rongtai made the outer shell of the field telephone. Then, they worked together to connect the eleven knobs on the field telephone. When the two of them worked all night and still couldn't figure out a clue, Qi Zhanhui was a little discouraged. Shen Rongtai said: "It doesn't matter, we will never stop until we succeed, anyway, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome!" Qi Zhanhui also cheered up and said: "Yes, we must resolutely make it a success!" The two of them worked and talked at the same time: Children who are afraid of falling will not learn to walk; if you are afraid of difficulties, you will never succeed!
    At this time, the division headquarters sent a technician to guide them. They continued to work. Qi Zhanhui connected the circuit incorrectly, so Shen Rongtai took over; Shen Rongtai's mind was confused, so Qi Zhanhui immediately took over. The two of them took turns, inspired each other, and assisted each other. They installed and disassembled, disassembled and installed, and finally connected the hybrid circuit.
    In the process of trial production, they also used all waste products and substitutes to make the parts on the "radio station." For example, they used small bullet casings as buttons, large bullet casings as lamp holders, pushpins as "contact points" on the knobs, and lamp heads from broken flashlights as the outer shell of the headphones. They did some things very smoothly, but some things were troublesome, such as making the knobs on the outer shell of the field telephone, which almost didn't work. At first, they used wood to make them, and it took three hours to carve one, but it split when they hammered a nail into it, and they couldn't get two or three out of more than ten carvings. Later, they thought that it would be good if they could cast a few by melting. The two of them successively used the smelly paint and paraffin from waste batteries for experiments, but the result was that either they couldn't melt things, or the things cast were too soft to be used. Finally, they found that the things cast with 60% paraffin and 40% rosin were both beautiful and firm, so they used it to cast the knobs.
    After a long period of hard work, the "radio station" was finally successfully manufactured. The signal corps department of the Beijing Military Region Artillery Headquarters appraised their "radio station" and said that it has three major advantages: First, it can be used to replace the "Type 71 field telephone" for daily training, which can ensure the quality of training and reduce the wear and tear of equipment; second, the cost is low, it can be manufactured in large quantities and widely promoted; third, it saves a lot of electricity, and if it is promoted among the signal corps of the artillery units in the Beijing area alone, it can save 14,000 yuan in electricity costs every year.

    两个班长的共产主义风格
    新华社记者　周长宗
    出席北京部队积极分子会议的代表们，对于重炮连电话班长齐占辉向大会献的一部没有真空管、不用组合电池的“电台”（报话机）都很感兴趣。它跟国产“七一型报话机”大小相仿，连外壳上的装置都相差不多。可是它不是仿制品，而是一种真正的创造。它上边的零件，是三合板、图钉、大头针、破手电筒、子弹壳和纸烟盒里的锡纸等乱七八糟的东西做成的。通信兵用它，可以在三十公里以内通话，传达指挥员的命令。
    这个“电台”是有线电话班长齐占辉和无线电话班长申荣泰两个人创造的。他们已经做了十多部，让通信兵用来进行训练。第一部“电台”，只花了三角六分钱；后来的几部，改进了某些机件，每部也只合两三块钱。
    齐占辉向记者叙述了他们大胆创造这种“电台”的经过。今年春天，面对祖国社会主义建设大跃进的形势，重炮连电话班战士们，提出人人要做“双能”通信兵——学会使用有线、无线电话双重本领。但是，两个电话班（有线电话班和无线电话班）只有几部报话机，人多器材少，使齐占辉和申荣泰两个班长为难了。他们想：如果多几部电台报话机，而且这种报话机轻易不会磨损和毁坏，又不用组合电池，通信兵天天坐在“电台”面前学习和训练，也消耗不了多少电，那多好啊！
    是不是自己可以制造这样一种电台呢？他们俩开了个碰头会，都有了这种念头，可是又有些胆怯。论文化程度，齐占辉只有小学二年级；申荣泰也没超过初小毕业水平，论军事知识，齐占辉入伍才二年，申荣泰也还不到三年。参军以前，他们都是庄稼汉，怎能制造一部技术复杂的报话机呢？但是，当他们想到：农民为实现水利化，把河水都引上了山，难道我们就不敢试试看吗？于是，他们下定决心，创造一部没有真空管、不用组合电池，既能练习操作、又能实际通话的
  “电台”报话机。
    怎样做呢？他们想到，如果通话按照电话原理，操作按照报话原理，或者能够做成。于是，俩人作了分工：齐占辉做通话用的感应线圈，申荣泰做报话机的外壳，接着，他们又一起动手做报话机上的十一个旋扭的线路连接。当他们两人干了一个通宵，还一点头绪没理出来时，齐占辉有点丧气，申荣泰说：“不要紧，弄不成我们绝不收兵，反正没有克服不了的困难！”齐占辉也提起了精神，说：“对，咱们坚决要把它搞成功！”两个人一边干，一边谈论着：小孩怕跌跤，就学不会走道；做事要害怕困难，就永远不会成功！
    这时，师部派了一个技师来，指导了他们一番。他们又接着干下去。齐占辉连接线路连接得不对头，申荣泰便接过来干；申荣泰头脑弄昏了，齐占辉就马上接手。两人相互轮换，相互启发，相互辅助。他们装上又拆，拆了又装，终于把混合线路接好。
    在试制过程中，他们又利用一切废品和代用品做“电台”上的部件。如拿小子弹壳做按扭，用大子弹壳做灯座，用大头针做旋扭上的
  “接触点”，用破手电筒上的灯头做耳机上的外壳等。有些东西他们做得很顺利，有些东西可是费了周折，如做报话机外壳上的旋扭时，险些没做成。开始用木头做，一刀刀地刻了三个钟头才刻好一个，可是一往上边楔钉子就劈了，刻十多个也捞不下两三个。后来他们想到，如能用溶铸的办法，铸造几个就好了。两个人先后用废电池里的臭漆和洋蜡进行试验，结果不是不能溶铸东西，就是铸出来的东西太软不能用。最后他们发现，用60％的洋蜡，加上40％的松香，铸成的东西又美观、又坚固，于是就用它铸成了旋扭。
    经过一段长时间的苦战，“电台”终于制造成功了。北京部队炮兵司令部通信兵部门给他们做的“电台”作了鉴定，说它有三大好处：第一、用它可以代替“七一型报话机”进行日常训练，能够保证训练质量，又减少了装备器材的磨损；第二、成本少，可以大量制造，普遍推广；第三、用电很节省，仅在北京地区的炮兵部队通信兵当中推广起来，每年就可以节约电费一万四千元。（附图片）
