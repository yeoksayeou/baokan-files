　　Field Selection of Seeds, Selecting the Best and Leaving Enough
　　Farmers Everywhere Launch Activities to Evaluate Good Seed Varieties

　　(Our dispatch) Selecting enough high-quality wheat seeds to strive for an even greater bumper harvest of wheat next year is a battle task for farmers in all regions during this year's wheat harvest. As the wheat harvest season arrives, many regions have already launched field selection of seeds or made preparations for seed selection.

　　According to preliminary plans in various regions, the area sown to winter wheat this year will be further expanded, and the experience of increasing production through more water, more fertilizer, and close planting will be further promoted. To this end, many regions have launched activities to evaluate high-quality wheat varieties that are resistant to water and fertilizer, and have formulated plans to select the best and leave enough. The provinces in the Pearl River and Yangtze River basins, where wheat has already been harvested or is being harvested, have already selected a large number of good seeds, which are properly stored by agricultural cooperatives and seed purchasing departments. Provinces in the Huai River and Yellow River basins, where the wheat harvest has begun or is about to begin, have made preparations for seed selection and retention, and will immediately join the battle once the harvest begins. In Yanshi County, Henan Province, agricultural cooperatives have universally organized specialized teams for selecting good seeds in order to do a good job in seed selection, and have provided technical training in seed selection for team members. In many counties in Hebei Province, agricultural cooperatives have erected flags and markers on wheat fields that are being prepared for seed selection after evaluation, and have assigned dedicated personnel to manage them. In Licheng, Linyi, Tai'an, Gaotang and other counties in Shandong Province, some agricultural cooperatives have mobilized members to discuss and formulate seed selection and retention plans, preparing to retain 25 to 30 jin per mu to meet the needs of close planting.

　　Leading organs at all levels in various regions are paying close attention to the work of selecting and retaining good seeds, and have organized visits and evaluations before the start of the wheat harvest to educate cadres and members about the importance of seed selection. In order to promote seed selection and retention work in various regions, the Ministry of Agriculture has sent two working groups to Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong and other places to conduct inspections.

　　田间选种  选好留足
    各地农民普遍展开评选良种活动
    本报讯　选留足够的优良麦种，争取明年小麦获得更大的丰收，是各地农民在今年麦收中一项战斗任务，很多地区随着麦收季节的到来，已经展开了田间选种或者做好了选种准备。
    根据各地初步计划，今年冬种小麦面积将进一步扩大，多水多肥和密植的增产经验将进一步推广，为此很多地区都展开了评选耐水耐肥的优良麦种的活动，并且订出了选好留够的计划。目前小麦已经收完或正在收打的珠江、长江流域各省，已经选好了大量良种，由农业社和种子收购部门妥善的保管起来；麦收已经开始或即将开始的淮河、黄河流域各省，都做好了选种留种工作的准备，一俟开镰即将投入战斗。河南省偃师县各农业社为了做好选种工作，普遍组织了精选良种专业队，对队员进行了选种技术训练。河北省很多县的农业社都在经过评比准备选种的麦田上插旗立标，固定专人负责管理。山东省历城、临沂、泰安、高唐等县有些农业社发动社员讨论，订出了选种留种计划，准备每亩留二十五斤到三十斤，以适应密植的需要。
    各地各级领导机关对选留良种的工作都抓的很紧，在麦收开始前纷纷组织参观评比，教育干部和社员重视选种工作。为了推动各地选种留种工作，农业部已派出两个工作组分赴河南、河北和江苏、广东等地进行检查。（附图片）
