　　In the June 6th editorial of this newspaper, "Look at Next Year This Year," it was stated that the leadership method of "looking at the next step from the current step, looking at next year from this year" can also be applied in industry and basic construction, as well as other construction endeavors. Today's news in this newspaper about Jiangxi Province actively preparing for the development of local industry next year proves that "looking at next year this year" is not only possible but also necessary for industrial departments.

　　For industrial departments, "looking at next year this year" means, on the one hand, summarizing the leaping-forward experience of the past nearly half-year and formulating next year's plan based on it. On the other hand, it also means making full use of the remaining half-year to make material preparations for next year's production and construction.

　　In the past few months, the leap forward on the industrial front has been advancing rapidly. Targets have been surpassed again and again, and the situation has been changing daily. A month ago, who could have imagined that tens of thousands of small blast furnaces with an annual output of 20 million tons of iron could be built within the next year?! According to the existing materials from various departments, the development speed of China's industry this year will not only far exceed the 14.6% initially planned at the beginning of this year but will certainly exceed the fastest-growing year in China's history (1953, when the growth rate was 31.7%). The question now is what about next year? Can we still have a high-speed leap forward? Based on the experience of the past few months, the potential for industrial development is still very large. In addition to the potential of existing factories and mines, we must also estimate that the development of local industry next year will greatly exceed this year. This is because the main focus of attention in various regions this year has been on the leap forward in agriculture. Manpower, financial resources, and materials have been mainly concentrated on the agricultural front. Large-scale local industrial development has only been a matter of the past two or three months, and many places have not had time to plan and take action. It is foreseeable that local industry will leap forward on an even larger scale and at a higher speed next year. If we do not see this point, if we do not prepare in advance, we will become passive in the future and it will be difficult to guarantee the needs of local industrial development next year. Therefore, from now on, we must "look at next year this year" and prepare as early as possible.

　　All industrial sectors are interrelated and interdependent. To produce a certain amount of steel, we must first see how much iron can be produced; to produce a certain number of machines, we must first see how many raw materials can be produced. This characteristic of "one step linked to the next, one link connected to another" requires industrial departments to use the leadership method of "looking at the next step from the current step, looking at next year from this year." Only by "looking at the next step from the current step, looking at next year from this year" can we adapt to the characteristics of industrial production and construction of "one step linked to the next, one link connected to another," prepare early, organize cooperation in various aspects, and ensure the continuous development of industrial production and the entire national economy. If we do not use the method of "looking at next year this year," if we use the method of "wait and see," and talk about next year's affairs after this year is over, we will inevitably be caught off guard in the future. This kind of leadership method without foresight cannot promote the adaptation of the part to the requirements of the overall development, cannot promote the adaptation of industry to the requirements of national economic development, and this method must be resolutely abandoned.

　　We Communists are proponents of continuous revolution. We believe that, whether in natural phenomena or social phenomena, the law of the unity of opposites, the law of quantitative change leading to qualitative change, and the law of affirmation and negation are always and universally present. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions arise. The unity and struggle of the opposing sides of contradictions promote the development of all things. Revolutionaries must grasp this law, constantly propose new tasks, and continuously carry out revolution in order to realize the great ideal of communism. As early as the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Engels expounded the idea of continuous revolution. Later, in the famous "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League," they more clearly pointed out that the battle cry of the working class should be continuous revolution. At that time, the German Communists were opposing the rule of the big bourgeoisie, feudalism, and autocracy together with the democratic petty-bourgeois parties. Marx and Engels pointed out that the revolution of the democratic petty-bourgeoisie only "wants to change the existing society in such a way as to make it as pleasant and comfortable as possible for them," "but our interest and our task is to make the revolution permanent," "For us, the issue is not changing private property, but abolishing private property, not concealing class contradictions, but eliminating classes; not reforming existing society, but establishing a new society." Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong used the theory of continuous revolution to lead the Chinese revolution. After seizing power in the whole country in 1949, the land reform was started on a national scale; as soon as the land reform was completed, agricultural cooperation began, followed by the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts; after the socialist transformation of the three major industries—the socialist revolution on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) was basically completed, socialist revolutions were carried out on the political and ideological fronts; now the socialist revolutions on the economic, political, and ideological fronts have all achieved basic victory, and the slogans of technical revolution and cultural revolution have been put forward. This continuous revolution has taken us from one goal to another, preventing us from ever becoming lax or complacent, and enabling us to constantly move forward.

　　In all practical work, we must also apply the idea of continuous revolution in order to pay attention to discovering new problems, proposing new tasks, and preventing our work from ever stagnating. "Looking at next year this year" means that we must have foresight, foresee the possible situations that may arise next year, strive for the upstream, propose new tasks as early as possible, and enable us to move forward to new victories with greater certainty after one victory.

　　Can industry develop at a high speed next year? This is a new question posed to the industrial sector, and it is also a test. We are always promoters and should have the courage to ensure that industry will develop at a high speed next year as well. This requires "looking at next year this year," starting early, and preparing early.

　　Perhaps some people say: "Doesn't that make this year's work even more tense?" Saying "more tense" of course means "already tense enough." Indeed, this year is already tense enough, but it seems that it is still possible to be "more tense." Jiangxi Province is "looking at next year this year" and, according to the preliminary plan for next year, has rearranged this year's work and added more than 200 small factory and mining construction projects. Hasn't this been arranged as well? It can be seen that the potential is always inexhaustible, the question is whether you see it or not.

　　In recent days, all regions have been vigorously publicizing the general line of socialist construction. The whole country is inspired. Some places are already checking their work in the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, and an even higher wave of the leap forward has begun to roll up. Under such circumstances, comrades on the industrial front should use the method of "looking at next year this year" to organize the broad masses to act more actively, based on the experience of the first half of this year, formulate next year's leap forward plan, and make full use of the second half of this year to strive to overfulfill this year's leap forward plan and make more preparations for a greater leap forward next year.

### 工业也要“今年看明年”

　　工业也要“今年看明年”
    6日本报社论“今年看明年”中说：“上步看下步，今年看明年”的领导方法，“在工业和基本建设方面以及其他各项建设事业同样是可以应用的”。今天本报发表的江西省积极为明年地方工业的发展作准备的新闻，证明了工业部门“今年看明年”不仅可能，而且必要。
    工业部门“今年看明年”，一方面是要总结已经过去将近半年的跃进经验，并据以制定明年的计划，另一方面，还要充分利用还剩下的半年的时间，为明年的生产和建设做好物质准备。
    过去的几个月，工业战线的跃进真个一日千里，指标一而再、再而三地被突破，行情日新月异。一个月以前，谁能够设想，今后一年内可以建成年产二千万吨铁的上万座小高炉呢？！从各部门已有的的材料看，今年我国工业的发展速度，将不仅远远超过今年年初拟订的14.6％，而且肯定可以超过我国历史上发展最快的年份（1953年，这一年的增长率为31.7％）。现在的问题是明年怎样？是不是仍然可以高速度地跃进？根据过去几个月的经验，发展工业的潜力仍然是很大的。除了现有厂矿企业的潜力外，还必须估计到明年地方工业的发展大大超过今年。因为各地今年的主要注意力放在农业的跃进上，人力、财力、物力主要是集中在农业战线上，大办地方工业还是最近两三个月的事情，而且有不少地方还没有来得及规划和动手。可以预料，明年地方工业将以更为巨大的规模和更高的速度飞跃。如果看不到这点，如果不未雨绸缪，将来就要被动，就难以保证明年地方工业发展的需要。因此，从现在起，就必须“今年看明年”，及早准备。
    工业的各个部门都是互相关连，互为前提的。要生产多少钢，先看能生产多少铁；要生产多少机器，先看能生产多少原材料。这种“一步连一步，一环扣一环”的特点，要求工业部门必须运用“上步看下步，今年看明年”的领导方法。只有“上步看下步，今年看明年”，才能适应“一步连一步，一环扣一环”的工业生产和建设的特点，及早准备，来组织各方面的协作，保证工业生产和整个国民经济的不断发展。如果不是运用“今年看明年”的方法，如果运用“走着瞧”的方法，过了今年再谈明年的事，就难免甚至将来会弄得手足无措。这种没有预见的领导方法，不能促进局部适应整体发展的要求，不能促进工业适应国民经济发展的要求，这种方法是我们必须坚决摒弃的。
    我们共产党人是不断革命论者。我们认为，不论在自然现象中或者在社会现象中，对立统一的规律、量变质变的规律、肯定否定的规律都是永远普遍存在的。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又产生了，矛盾着的对立面的统一和斗争推动着一切事物的发展。革命者必须掌握这个规律，不断地提出新的任务，不断革命，才能实现共产主义的伟大理想。早在“共产党宣言”中，马克思和恩格斯就阐述了不断革命的思想，后来在著名的“中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书”中，更明确指出：工人阶级的战斗口号应该是不断革命。当时，德国共产党人正同民主主义的小资产阶级政党一起反对大资产阶级、封建主义和专制制度的统治。马克思和恩格斯指出，民主主义的小资产者的革命，只是“想使社会制度发生一种能把现存社会弄成对他们尽可能惬意和舒服些的改变”，“而我们的利益和我们的任务，却是要革命成为不停顿的”，“对于我们，问题不在于改变私有制，而在于废除私有制，不在于掩盖阶级矛盾，而在于消灭阶级；不在于改良现存社会，而在于建立新社会。”我们党和毛泽东同志就是运用不断革命的理论来领导中国革命的。1949年在全国范围夺取了政权之后，就开始了全国范围的土地改革；土地改革一完成，就开始农业合作化，接着又是对私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造；社会主义三大改造——经济战线（生产资料所有制方面）的社会主义革命基本完成以后，又进行了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命；现在经济战线上、政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命都已经取得基本胜利，又提出了技术革命和文化革命的口号。这种不断的革命，使我们从一个目标前进到另一个目标，使我们永远不致于松懈，不致于自满，使我们永远不断地前进。
    在各种实际工作中，同样必须运用不断革命的思想，才能注意去发现新的问题，提出新的任务，使我们的工作永远不陷于停顿。“今年看明年”，就是使我们要有预见，要预见到明年可能出现的情况，要力争上游，及早提出新的任务，使我们能够在一个胜利以后更有把握地朝新的胜利前进。
    明年工业能不能高速度地发展？这是向工业部门提出的一个新的问题，也是一个考验。我们永远是促进派，应该有这样的气魄：要使明年工业同样高速度地发展，这就需要“今年看明年”，早动手，早准备。
    也许有人说：“那今年的工作不是更紧张了吗？”说“更紧张”，意思当然是“本来就够紧张的了”。确实，今年已经够紧张的了，但看来“更紧张”一些也还是可以的。江西省“今年看明年”，根据初步确定的明年的计划，重新安排了今年的工作，新增加了两百多个小型厂矿的建设项目，不是也安排下去了吗？可见，潜力总是挖不完的，问题是你看见看不见。
    这几天，各地都在大张旗鼓地宣传社会主义建设总路线。举国上下，人心振奋。有的地方已经在根据社会主义建设总路线的精神检查工作，一个更高的跃进浪头开始卷了上来。在这种情况下，在工业战线上的同志们，应该运用“今年看明年”的方法，组织广大群众更加积极地行动起来，根据今年上半年的经验，订出明年的跃进计划，并充分利用今年下半年的时间，力争超额完成今年的跃进计划，并为明年更大的跃进作更多的准备。
