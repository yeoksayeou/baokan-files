Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th - The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the China Construction Trade Union held another on-site conference on technological innovation in Shanghai from the 10th to the 16th, attended by more than a thousand representatives from the construction sector. The conference is preparing to launch a mass movement of technological innovation among one million construction workers nationwide.

The amount of engineering work undertaken by construction departments in various regions this year has increased several times, even dozens of times, compared to last year. To accomplish such a huge task, it is necessary to vigorously promote the technological innovation movement and rapidly increase the proportion of mechanized, semi-mechanized, and industrialized construction methods.

After visiting the National Construction Industry Technological Innovation Exhibition and listening to the report by Shanghai representatives on the elimination of manual labor in Shanghai within seven days, the representatives further clarified that eliminating heavy manual labor on construction sites is the first step for construction enterprises to mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in technological revolution. However, to take this step well, it is also necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking in the leadership. Shanghai's experience vividly proves this point. Regarding the elimination of manual labor, the leading cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau initially lacked confidence, proposing "to eliminate manual labor within three to five years, mainly through mechanized operation..." Later, after seeing the masses create many new tools, they felt that the leadership's thinking was lagging behind, shortening the time for eliminating manual labor to two or three years, then further shortening it to three to six months, and finally proposing the call to "exert full effort, work hard for seven days, eliminate manual labor on a few construction sites, and establish a banner." As a result, many construction sites eliminated manual labor in less than seven days, even within one or two days. During those days, the working masses rushed to produce more than 1,300 vehicles for transportation and more than 240 pieces of lifting equipment. More than 30 representative delegations from all over the country held meetings one after another, proposing to strive to eliminate the phenomenon of manual labor within ten days, half a month, or even three to five days after returning.

At the exhibition, the representatives saw various machines created by construction workers from all over the country. Some of these machines and equipment increased production efficiency by several times to dozens of times, and 80% were created by the working masses. These advanced individuals and advanced examples made the representatives further realize the great creative power of construction workers.

The conference concluded with a summary report by Liu Xiufeng, Minister of Construction Engineering. Liu Xiufeng said: "The direction of the technological revolution in the construction industry should be to develop prefabricated reinforced concrete structures, implement mechanized construction, and gradually realize the industrialization of construction." Liu Xiufeng finally called on construction workers across the country to completely eliminate manual labor within two months, fully adopt improved tools within six months, and strive to achieve a labor productivity of 8,000 to 10,000 yuan per worker per year, calculated by output value, and to carry out construction work more, faster, better, and more economically, to adapt to the new situation of the leap forward development of construction undertakings.

    建筑业技术革命的号角响了
    建筑部门代表在上海集会，号召全国百万建筑工人两个月内消灭肩挑人抬，半年内全部采用改良工具
    据新华社上海18日电　建筑工程部和中国建筑工会全国委员会10日到16日又在上海召开有一千多位建筑部门代表参加的技术革新现场会议。会议准备在全国一百万建筑工人中掀起革新技术的群众运动。
    今年各地建筑部门担负的工程量比去年增加几倍甚至几十倍。要完成这样巨大的任务，就必须要大搞技术革新运动，迅速提高机械化、半机械化和工厂化的施工比例。
    代表们在参观了全国建筑业技术革新展览会，听了上海代表介绍上海在七天内消灭肩挑人抬现象的报告以后，进一步明确了：消灭工地上笨重的肩挑人抬劳动，就是建筑企业发动广大群众大搞技术革命的第一步。但是要走好这一步，还必须克服领导思想上的右倾保守思想。上海的经验生动地证明了这一点。关于消灭肩挑人抬现象，上海市建筑工程局领导干部开始时信心也不足，他们提出“三、五年内消灭肩挑人抬，主要操作机械化……”；以后看到群众创造出许多新工具，感到领导思想落后了，把消灭肩挑人抬的时间缩短为两、三年，随后又缩短到三个月到半年，最后提出了“鼓足干劲，苦战七天，在少数工地上消灭肩挑人抬，树立旗帜”的号召。结果，许多工地不到七天，甚至一两天内就消灭了肩挑人抬现象。在那几天中，工人群众赶制出运输用的车子有一千三百多辆，起重设备有二百四十多件。来自全国各地的三十多个代表团纷纷开会，提出要在回去后不出十天半月甚至三五天内，争取消灭肩挑人抬的现象。
    在展览会上，代表们看到各地建筑工人创造的各种机器。这些机器设备，有的提高生产效率几倍到几十倍，80％是工人群众创造出来的。这些先进人物和先进事例，使代表们进一步体会到建筑工人有着伟大的创造力量。
    会议最后听了建筑工程部部长刘秀峰的总结报告。刘秀峰说：“建筑业技术革命的方向，应当是发展装配式钢筋混凝土结构，实行机械化施工，逐步实现建筑工业化。”刘秀峰最后号召全国建筑工人，在两个月内全部消灭肩挑人抬现象，半年内全部采用改良工具，争取明年以每工年产值计算的劳动生产率达到八千元到一万元，把建筑工作搞得又多、又快、又好、又省，以适应建设事业飞跃发展的新形势。
