Good Rain Falls Widely in Guangxi

　　Nanning, June 13 (by our own correspondent) From June 7th to 12th, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which had been suffering from a long drought, experienced widespread welcome rain. Except for the Guilin area, where rainfall was relatively low, most areas in the other five regions received over 50 millimeters of rainfall, alleviating the drought situation. In more than ten counties, including Luocheng, Long'an, LingLe, and Beiliu, rainfall reached over 100 millimeters, basically eliminating the threat of drought.

　　Party and government leading bodies at all levels issued urgent notices overnight, urging all localities to seize the opportunity after the rain to concentrate efforts on crash-transplanting mid-season rice, rush-sowing late-season rice, and vigorously storing and conserving water. In Luocheng County, on June 7th, twenty townships mobilized 48,000 people to rush-plow and rush-harrow over 6,400 mu of dry land and rush-sow over 470,000 jin of late-rice seeds, with one day's sowing amount equivalent to the achievement of ten days before the rain.

　　In areas with less rainfall, people of all ethnic groups are still blocking rivers, digging underground water sources, and continuing to persevere in fighting and preventing drought, striving to complete the task of transplanting mid-season rice and sowing late-season rice.

    广西普降喜雨
    本报南宁13日电　长期干旱的广西僮族自治区，在6月7日至12日普降喜雨。全自治区除桂林专区降雨量较少外，其余五个专区的大部分地区，降雨量一般都在五十毫米以上，旱象已经缓和。罗城、隆安、凌乐、北流等十多个县，降雨量达到一百毫米以上，干旱威胁基本解除。
    各级党、政领导机关都连夜发出紧急通知，要求各地抓紧雨后时机，全力突击抢插中稻、抢播晚稻，大力蓄水保水。罗城县在7日有二十个乡出动了四万八千多人，抢犁抢耙旱田六千四百多亩，抢播晚稻种子四十七万多斤，一天的播种量相当于雨前十天的成绩。
    落雨较少的地区，各族农民仍在拦江堵河，挖掘地下水源，继续坚持抗旱防旱，力争完成中稻插秧和晚稻播种的任务。
