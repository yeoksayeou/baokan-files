Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Cypriot Archbishop Makarios issued a statement in Athens on the 12th regarding the situation in Cyprus. He emphasized that the British government must bear "equal responsibility, if not greater responsibility, for the Turkish mob's atrocities, because this terrible rampage of bloodshed, arson, and violence occurred under the British government's indifference or with its consent."

The insidious face of British colonialists using the old trick of "divide and rule" to incite discord between Greek and Turkish residents on the island of Cyprus is being exposed. Pissas, the General Secretary of the Cyprus Confederation of Labor, who was exiled by the British authorities, pointed out in a statement to reporters that certain British agencies are inciting civil war between Turkish and Greek residents in Cyprus. He emphasized that Britain bears serious responsibility for the recent tragic events in Cyprus. Greek Foreign Minister Averoff announced on the evening of the 12th that the Greek government had written to the President of the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to note the threat to peace arising from the atrocities of Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus, and had instructed the Greek representative to the United Nations to request UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to intervene in the situation in Cyprus.

Averoff said that the Greek government had also protested to the British Ambassador to Greece regarding the British authorities' failure to protect Greek residents on the island of Cyprus.

According to the Greek newspaper "News," the Greek government also considered "abolishing the Balkan Pact (of Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia) and declaring that it will no longer cooperate with Turkey within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" at a cabinet meeting held on the 12th.

Reports from Nicosia indicate that the bloodshed of Turkish mobs attacking Greek residents on the island of Cyprus has continued for the sixth day.

In the village of Gioneli, about five miles from Nicosia, on the 12th, Turkish thugs on motorcycles used machine guns to strafe a group of Greek residents, killing two and seriously injuring three.

In Famagusta, eastern Cyprus, Turkish mobs attacked Greek residents on the 12th who were trying to avoid persecution and were moving out of Turkish residential areas, injuring at least seventeen people. Currently, Greek residents on the island are beginning to establish self-defense forces.

On the 12th, Ankara Radio in the Turkish capital continuously broadcast speeches by Turkish chauvinists to Turkish Cypriot mobs, inciting them against the Greeks.

    塞浦路斯大主教发表声明
    英国要对土耳其人暴行负责
    希腊要求安理会注意塞浦路斯局势
    据新华社13日讯 塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯12日在雅典对塞浦路斯局势发表了声明。他强调指出，英国政府要对土耳其族暴民的暴行“负同等的责任，如果不是负更大的责任的话，因为这次可怕的胡作非为的流血、放火和暴力行为是在英国政府的漠不关心或者同意的态度下发生的”。
    英国殖民主义者采取“分而治之”的老办法来煽动塞浦路斯岛上希、土两族居民的不和的阴险面目正在暴露出来。被英国当局流放的塞浦路斯总工会总书记皮萨斯在向记者发表的声明中指出，英国某些机关正在煽动居住在塞浦路斯的土耳其族人和希腊族人进行内战。他强调，英国对于塞浦路斯最近发生的悲惨事件负有严重的责任。希腊外交部长阿维罗夫12日晚间宣布：希腊政府已经写信给联合国安全理事会主席，要求安全理事会注意由于塞浦路斯岛的土耳其族人的暴行而产生的对和平的威胁，并且已经指示希腊驻联合国的代表，要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德干与塞浦路斯的局势。
    阿维罗夫说，希腊政府还就英国当局的不能保护塞浦路斯岛上的希腊族居民向英国驻希腊大使提出了抗议。
    据希腊“新闻报”报道，希腊政府在12日举行的内阁会议上还考虑了“废除（希腊、土耳其、南斯拉夫三国）巴尔干公约，并且声明今后将不在北大西洋公约组织范围内同土耳其进行任何合作”的问题。
    来自尼科西亚的消息表明，塞浦路斯岛上土耳其暴民袭击希腊族居民的流血事件已经继续到第六天。
    在距离尼科西亚约五英里地方的吉奥内利村，12日骑着机器脚踏车的土耳其族打手用机关枪向一群希腊族居民扫射，打死了两人，三人受重伤。
    在塞浦路斯岛东部的法马古斯太，土耳其族暴民12日袭击了想避免受到迫害而正在迁出土耳其族人居住区的希腊族人，至少有十七人受了伤。目前，这个岛上的希腊族居民正在着手建立自卫队。
    土耳其首都安卡拉电台在12日不断地向塞浦路斯的土耳其族暴民播送土耳其沙文主义分子的演说，煽动他们反对希腊人。
