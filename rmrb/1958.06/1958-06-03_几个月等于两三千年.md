　　A Few Months Equals Two or Three Thousand Years
　　Liu Feng
　　Those who have visited the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition are all amazed by the incredible wisdom and talent of the workers and peasants. Many of the creative methods are ingenious; with just a slight modification of the old tools by the masses, physical labor is immediately reduced and labor efficiency is improved. The agricultural tools they create and改造 have the characteristics of being locally sourced, locally manufactured, highly efficient, and low in cost. Only farmers can do this. Foreign experts have never made such contributions.
　　These tens of thousands of new and reformed agricultural tools on display are truly a vast ocean of wisdom. Seeing the exhibits will indeed enlighten people and make them smarter.
　　A piece of wood with a prism-shaped hole becomes a corn thresher, increasing manual labor by two or three times. A horse-drawn generator can generate electricity with just two or three steps of human pushing. Windmills can use level three or four winds to drain, irrigate, thresh, grind flour, gin cotton, roll cotton, and generate electricity. Uphill carts have wheels that can only move forward when climbing, not backward, and the carriage is movable, automatically balancing the center of gravity according to the slope of the mountain. A treadle waterwheel, operated by two semi-able-bodied people sitting on it and pressing back and forth, can irrigate the land. A six-row three-purpose seeder not only sows six rows of seeds but also simultaneously waters and fertilizes. Rice seedling boats allow for transplanting seedlings while sitting, avoiding bending over. Cargo bamboo rafts have a shallow draft and can carry six tons of goods on rivers with only two inches of water. Amphibious boats have wooden wheels on the bottom; when the waterway is blocked, they can be pushed ashore. Such unbelievable things have become reality.
　　Most of these creators and innovators are ordinary peasants and rural handicraft laborers—carpenters and blacksmiths. They are usually poor and uneducated, but during the upsurge of production, they display endless wisdom and creative talents that make scholars and experts speechless. Just a few months ago, these farmers were still using the pitiful old agricultural tools left by our ancestors two or three thousand years ago; some were even still in the age of slash-and-burn cultivation, planting extensively but harvesting little. Now, in just a few months of the Great Leap Forward, they have reformed these agricultural tools, leaping forward by two or three thousand years at once. What an amazing leap! Doesn't this completely confirm that the great era that Marx predicted a century ago, that "one day is equal to twenty years," has already been realized here?
　　With their minds liberated, coupled with the needs of the situation, they were unwilling to stay in the same old place in technology for two or three thousand years, so they automatically rose up to reform agricultural tools. Thus, they leaped over two or three thousand years at once, reforming the ancient agricultural tools that had been used for countless generations, and new technology replaced the old. At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, comrades from all over the country who came to visit and learn were meticulously drawing patterns and carefully recording explanations, fully demonstrating their eagerness to reform technology and their heartfelt praise and admiration for these technological reforms. From this exchange of technical experience, they further inspired creativity and opened the door to wisdom. From here, one can also foresee that more brilliant flowers of technological revolution will bloom everywhere.

　　几个月等于两三千年
　　刘丰
    参观了全国农具展览会的人们，没有谁不叹服工人和农民群众的惊人的智慧和才能。有许多创造方法是巧妙的，只经群众稍稍地改变了一下旧工具，马上就减轻了体力劳动，提高了劳动效率。他们创造和改造的农具都有就地取材，就地制造，效率高，成本低的特点。这只有农民自己才能做得到。洋专家们从来就不曾作过这样的贡献。
    这些陈列着的成千上万的新创造的和改革了的农具，真是一个巨大的智慧的海洋，看了展览品的确会使人们开了窍，聪明起来。
    一块木头挖了一个棱形洞就成了玉米脱粒器，却提高了人工劳动的两三倍。马拉发电机，人推走两三步就能发出电来。风车利用三、四级风就可以排水灌溉、脱粒、磨面、弹花、轧花、发电。上山马车，爬坡时车轮只能前转不能倒退，车厢是活动的，可以随着山坡的斜度而自动随时平衡重心。压板式水车，两个半劳动力，坐在上面压来压去就能浇地。六行三用耧，不但能播下六行种籽，而且能同时浇水、施肥。稻秧船，可以坐着插秧，免得弯腰操作。运货竹筏，吃水浅，只要在有二寸水的小河，就可载着六吨货行驶。水陆两用船，船底有木轮遇到水道不通的地方，就可以上岸推着走。诸如此类，难以令人置信的事，竟成了现实。
    这些创造者和革新者，绝大部分都是普通的农民和农村中的手工业劳动者——木匠、铁匠。他们平时也是一穷二白，可是在生产高潮中，他们就显示了无穷无尽的智慧和使学者、专家俯首无言的创造性才能。仅仅在几个月前，这些农民还是在使用两三千年我们祖先遗留下来的古老得可怜的农具，有的甚至还是处在刀耕火种、广种薄收的世纪。而现在仅仅在几个月的跃进中，他们就改革了这些农具，一下子就跃进了两三千年。这是一个多么惊人的飞跃！仅仅从这件事上不是已经完全证实了马克思在百年之前所预言过的“一天等于二十年”的伟大时期，已经在我们这里实现了吗？
    思想解放了，再加上形势的需要，他们于是不干心在技术上再呆在两三千年前的老地方，他们于是自动地起来改革农具。于是一下子就走过了两三千年，把使用了无数世代的古老农具一下子改革掉了，新技术代替了旧技术。在全国农具展览会上，各地派来参观和学习的同志是那么一笔一画的仔细地在描绘图样，认真地记录说明，完全可以看出他们对革新技术是多么迫切，他们对这些技术改革是衷心的赞美和羡慕的，他们从这次的技术经验交流中，进一步启发了创造性，开启了智慧的大门。从这里，也可以预见到更灿烂的技术革命的花朵将到处开放。
