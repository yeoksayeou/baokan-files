  　Working Principle of Single-Cylinder Two-Stroke Gas Water Pump

    I. Starting Method:
    A. Coal Gas Charging Method:
    First, press down the intake valve, then pull open the check valve. At this point, introduce coal gas into the cylinder. Once coal gas is visible at the check valve, close the intake and exhaust valves. Then, use an air pump to pump air into the cylinder, forming a mixture of coal gas and air. Open the bleeder valve, and when the mixture passes through the red-hot fire tube, it will ignite. Immediately close the bleeder valve, and the mixture in the cylinder will explode.
    B. Air Pumping Method:
    Close the intake and exhaust valves, and use an air pump to pump air into the cylinder through the air valve. As the pressure inside the cylinder gradually increases, the water level at the cylinder head drops, while the water level at the other end rises. When a certain height difference is reached, the exhaust valve is pushed open, and the high water head rushes towards the cylinder head. When water flows from the cylinder head to the outlet, a pressure drop is generated inside the cylinder, causing the intake valve to open automatically, allowing the mixture to enter. When water flows back from the outlet, it forces the mixture into the fire tube, causing combustion, and the mixture inside the cylinder also explodes.

    II. Working Process:
    A. Explosion and Intake Process:
    After the mixture in the cylinder burns, the volume inside the cylinder expands. At this point, the gas pushes the water towards the outlet, creating a significant pressure drop inside the cylinder momentarily. The intake valve opens automatically, and the exhaust valve also opens due to its own weight. Simultaneously, the bottom and side intake valves open to allow water to enter.
    B. Exhaust and Compression Process:
    When water flows back from the outlet, it first closes the bottom and side intake valves, then flows into the cylinder. It first sweeps out the exhaust gas from the exhaust valve, and the exhaust gas pushes open the check valve and escapes into the atmosphere. The inertia of the water closes the exhaust valve. As water continues to flow upwards, it compresses the mixture, forcing it into the fire tube to burn, causing the volume inside the cylinder head to expand again. (Attached picture)

  　单缸二冲程燃气水泵工作原理
    一、起动方法：
    甲、充煤气法：
    先把进气门按下，再把止回阀拉开，这时把煤气鼓入气缸内，当在止回阀看到煤气即可，然后关闭进排气门，再通过气筒向缸内打入空气，这时煤气和空气即形成混合气。打开放气截门，混合气经烧红的火管时，就被点燃马上关闭放气截门，汽缸内的混合气即行爆发。
    乙、打空气法：
    把进排气门关闭，用气筒通过空气门将空气打入汽缸内，由于汽缸内压力逐渐增大，使汽缸头部水位下降，另端水位增高，到一定高度差时推开排气门，高水头即对汽缸头部流冲，当水从汽缸头流向出水口时，汽缸内产生压力降，进气阀自动启开，进混合气，当水从出水口回流时把混合气压入火管内，即行燃烧，汽缸内混合气也进行爆发。
    二、工作过程：
    甲、爆发进气过程：
    汽缸内混合气燃烧后，汽缸内体积即行膨胀，这时气体推着水流向出水口，在瞬时汽缸内产生很大的压力降，此时进气阀自行启开，排气阀也由于本身重量自行启开，同时，底进水阀、侧进水阀启开进水。
    乙、排气压缩过程：
    当水从出水口回流时首先将底、侧进水阀关闭，然后流到汽缸内，先把废气从排气门扫出，废气推开止回阀跑到大气中，利用水的惯性把排气门关闭，当水继续上流时，对混合气进行压缩，把混合气压入火管即行燃烧，汽缸头内体积再度膨胀。（附图片）
