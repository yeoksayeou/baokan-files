    Lackey's Grievance
    Recently, a series of merchant suicides have occurred in South Vietnam, painting a bleak picture of the American-controlled South Vietnamese economy. As the American economic crisis deepens, the plight of the South Vietnamese economy will become even more unmanageable. Faced with this grim reality, even some members of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are beginning to complain a little about the United States. Ngo Dinh Diem's brother and "political advisor" Ngo Dinh Nhu told a French reporter: "South Vietnam's economic development has been affected by the slow actions of the United States." Ngo Dinh Nhu's words were just a small complaint. However, the American overlords were furious and said Ngo Dinh Nhu's words were "insulting."
    Having become a lackey of the United States, one cannot say anything bad about the United States; even if it is bad, one must say it is good, otherwise one will be scolded. Ngo Dinh Nhu probably forgot this principle.

    奴才牢骚
    最近南越不断发生商人自杀事件，给美国控制下的南越经济勾画出一幅惨淡的图景。随着美国经济危机的加深，南越经济的困境还会更加不可收拾。面对这种冷酷的事实，连吴庭艳集团的某些分子也开始对美国有点抱怨了。吴庭艳的弟弟和“政治顾问”吴庭仟向法国记者说：“南越的经济发展受了美国行动迟缓的影响”。吴庭仟的这句话，不过是发点小牢骚而已。但是，以主子自居的美国佬却大发雷霆，说吴庭仟的话是“侮辱性”的。
    做了美国的奴才，就不能说美国不好，不好也要说好，否则就要挨骂，吴庭仟大概忘记这个道理了。
