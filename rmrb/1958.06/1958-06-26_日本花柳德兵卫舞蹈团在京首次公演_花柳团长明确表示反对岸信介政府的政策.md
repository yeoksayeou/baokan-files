Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: Hanayagi Tokubei, leader of the Japanese Hanayagi Tokubei Dance Troupe, stated in his speech at the opening ceremony of the troupe's performance at the Capital Theater tonight, "I clearly express my opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's policies towards China." He added, "We feel it is our responsibility to struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policies of creating 'two Chinas' and obstructing friendship between the peoples of Japan and China."

Hanayagi Tokubei said, "It is with the above wishes of the Japanese people that we accepted the invitation to visit China." He also said that they had "received a warm welcome in China, and we are moved by this deep friendship. At the same time, we have personally experienced the Chinese people's indignation towards the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government."

He said: "On the foundation of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, we will eliminate all obstacles and strive to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries. Therefore, if the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its policies to those based on a truly friendly spirit in the future, no matter what its policies are, we will fully supervise and resolutely struggle against them, because this is first and foremost a major issue concerning the interests of the Japanese people."

Speaking about the dance troupe's visit and performances, he hoped that through the performance of classical and folk Japanese dances, the Chinese people would be able to understand the lives and hopes of the Japanese people, as well as their desire for peace and friendship, as expressed in these dances.

Chen Zhongjing, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, then spoke, warmly welcoming the Hanayagi Tokubei Dance Troupe's visit and performances. He said: "The Chinese people have always valued the friendly cultural relations between the peoples of China and Japan, and have always strictly distinguished and treated separately the Japanese people's friendship towards the Chinese people and the Japanese militarist government's hostility towards the Chinese people."

When discussing the prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, Chen Zhongjing said that it is the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is attempting to revive Japanese militarism in Asia and is full of imperialist desires, that is trying every possible means and plotting to obstruct and undermine the friendly cultural relations between the peoples of China and Japan. If it does not fundamentally correct its mistakes, continues to be hostile to the Chinese people, and continues to play the "two Chinas" conspiracy, the friendly cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan cannot proceed as usual as in the past, and will inevitably be severely affected. If the peoples of China and Japan hope to continue to promote friendly cultural exchanges, they must resolutely fight against the Kishi Nobusuke government's submission to the United States, hostility towards the Chinese people, and playing the "two Chinas" conspiracy, until normal relations are restored between China and Japan. He believes that Director Hanayagi's speech just now has expressed such a desire, which will surely receive the sympathy and support of the Chinese people.

Chen Zhongjing wished the Hanayagi Dance Troupe a successful performance and believed that their visit would play a positive role in the friendly ties and artistic exchanges between the cultural circles of China and Japan.

The Japanese Hanayagi Dance Troupe performed more than ten classical and folk dance programs tonight, including "Sanbaso," "Snow, Moon, and Flowers," and "Mother and Child Lion Dance." Their folk-style dance movements aroused great interest among people in the literary and artistic circles of the capital and more than a thousand spectators.

Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Yang Hansheng, Vice President, met with Director Hanayagi Tokubei and other leaders of the dance troupe during the intermission of the performance and congratulated them on their successful performance.

    日本花柳德兵卫舞蹈团在京首次公演
    花柳团长明确表示反对岸信介政府的政策
    新华社25日讯　日本花柳德兵卫舞蹈团团长花柳德兵卫，今晚在舞蹈团于首都剧场举行的演出开幕式上致词说，“我明确地表示反对岸信介政府对中国的政策”，“我们感到有责任同岸信介政府所采取的制造‘两个中国’的政策和阻挠日中两国人民友好的作法，进行斗争”。
    花柳德兵卫说，“我们就是抱着日本人民以上的愿望才应邀来华访问的”。他还说，他们在中国“受到了欢迎，我们为这种深厚的友谊所感动，同时，我们也亲身体会到中国人民对日本岸信介政府的激愤”。
    他说：“在中日两国人民的友谊的基础上，我们将排除一切障碍为恢复两国的邦交而进行努力。因此，如果今后岸信介政府不把他的政策改变为以真正友好精神为基础的政策的话，不管它是怎么样的政策，我们也要充分地进行监督，坚决地进行斗争，因为这首先是有关日本国民的利益的重大问题”。
    在谈到有关舞蹈团的访问演出情况时，他希望通过古典和民间的日本舞蹈的演出，中国人民能够理解这些舞蹈所表现出来的日本人民的生活、希望和他们对和平与友好的愿望。
    中国人民对外文化协会秘书长陈忠经接着讲话，对花柳德兵卫舞蹈团的访问演出表示热诚欢迎。他说：“中国人民一贯地重视中日两国人民之间的文化友好关系，也一贯地将日本人民对中国人民的友谊和日本军国主义政府对中国人民的敌视严格地区别开来，分别对待”。
    在谈到中日文化交流的发展前途时，陈忠经说，千方百计、处心积虑地阻挠和破坏中日两国人民的文化友好关系的，正是妄图使日本军国主义在亚洲东山再起、充满帝国主义欲望的岸信介政府。如果它不根本改正错误，继续敌视中国人民，继续玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，中日两国人民的文化友好往来就不可能像过去一样照常进行，不可能不受到严重影响。中日两国人民如果抱着继续促进文化友好往来的愿望，就必须坚决地同岸信介政府的屈从美国、敌视中国人民、玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋作斗争，直到中日两国恢复正常关系为止。他认为，花柳团长刚才的讲话已经表达了这样的愿望，这必将得到中国人民的同情和支持。
    陈忠经祝花柳舞蹈团演出成功，并且认为他们的访问对中日两国文化界的友好联系和艺术交流都将起良好的作用。
    日本花柳舞蹈团今晚演出了“三番叟”、“雪·月·花”、“母子狮舞”等十多个古典和民间的舞蹈节目。他们富有民族特色的舞蹈动作引起了我国首都文艺界人士和一千多观众的很大兴趣。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南、副会长阳翰笙，在演出休息期间接见了花柳德兵卫团长和舞蹈团的其他负责人，祝贺他们的演出成功。
