"The Injustice to Dou E" and Others
    Yi Bing

    Guan Hanqing created more than sixty plays in his lifetime, of which eighteen original works survive. His achievements in artistic creation throughout his life, whether in terms of quantity or quality, are at the peak of world dramatic culture, while the era in which he lived was one of the darkest periods in Chinese history. At that time, folk literary artists and ordinary people suffered the same hardships, and they were actually in a humble position of "eight prostitutes, nine Confucians" in society. This closely combined the fate of literary artists with the fate of the people, enabling them to deeply understand and reflect the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the masses of people, and to stand with the people at the forefront of the struggle, charging forward. Many excellent works of Yuan Zaju represent the voice of this era, reflecting the immortal sparks of the people's struggle for survival and justice at that time. Guan Hanqing's excellent works are the peak of such works. He is the leader and banner of this generation of fighting dramatists.

    Guan Hanqing's "The Injustice to Dou E" has long been regarded as his best representative work. Dou E in his writing is the most unfortunate woman who is oppressed and devastated. She is a child bride. Because her mother-in-law did not listen to her advice and brought in the villains Zhang Donkey and his son, she was later framed by them and suffered thousands of beatings in the courtroom of the prefect of Chu Prefecture. In order to save her mother-in-law from being beaten, she took on the crimes that the corrupt officials and bad guys had forced on her, and was therefore sentenced to death. But Dou E did not yield. Before her execution, she accused the sinful feudal system. Her soaring resentment changed the laws of nature: blood splattered three feet on the white silk, a heavy snow fell in June, and Chu Prefecture suffered a three-year drought. Her resentment made her unable to rest in peace, and she turned into a ghost to seek revenge. In the end, victory belonged to her, and failure belonged to her persecutors.

    "Butterfly Dream" is also one of the author's outstanding works. The author塑造(shaped/molded) a glorious image of a poor old woman and three poor young people: Wang, the old man, was killed innocently by Ge Huangqin. His wife took her three sons to find the enemy to avenge her husband. The sons, in anger, beat the tyrant Ge Biao to death and were arrested by the local government and sent to Kaifeng Prefecture to pay for their lives. According to the law, Judge Bao did not care about the case of Ge Biao beating Wang, the old man, to death, but only questioned the crime of "common people beating ordinary people" (privileged class), and severely tortured the three Wang brothers. However, Bao Zheng was finally moved by the justice of Wang's mother and released the three Wang brothers.

    In "Saving the Prostitute," the author enthusiastically praised Zhao Pan'er for her beauty, wit, boldness, and chivalry, exposed the greed, brutality, and stupidity of the wealthy tyrant Zhou She, and deeply aroused people's hatred for the feudal ruling class. This is an excellent satirical play. This play, together with "The Injustice to Dou E," "Butterfly Dream," and other masterpieces of the author, demonstrates the author's distinct popular and combative nature. His humanitarian spirit and optimism are reflected in his works, becoming an excellent style that closely combines realism and romanticism.

    “窦娥冤”及其它
    伊兵
    关汉卿一生创作了六十多个剧本，现存原著十八个。他一生艺术创造上的成果，无论从数量上或者质量上来说，都处在世界戏剧文化的高峰，而他所处的时代，则是中国历史上最黑暗的时期之一。其时，民间的文学艺术家和普通人民遭受着同等的苦难，他们在社会上实际处于“八娼、九儒”的卑微地位，这使文学艺术家的命运和人民的命运紧紧地结合在一起，使他们能够深刻地体会和反映人民群众的思想、感情和情绪，使他们和人民一起，站在斗争的前沿阵地，冲锋陷阵。元杂剧的许多优秀作品，代表了这一时代的呼声，反映了当时人民为生存为正义而斗争的不灭的火花，关汉卿的优秀作品则是这类作品中的高峰，他是这一代战斗的戏剧家的领袖和旗帜。
    关汉卿的“窦娥冤”长期以来被人们目为最好的代表作品。在他笔下的窦娥是被压迫被摧残的最不幸的女人。她是个童养媳。由于她婆婆不听她的忠告，招进了恶棍张驴儿父子，后来受他们陷害，在楚州州官的大堂上受千般拷打。她为了免除婆婆受毒打，把赃官、坏人强加在她身上的罪名承担了下来，因此被判死刑。但窦娥并不屈服，她在临刑前对罪恶的封建制度作了控诉，她的怨气冲天改变了自然的规律：血溅上三尺白练，六月大雪，楚州亢旱三年，怨气使她死不瞑目，化作鬼魂也要报仇，最后胜利归于她，失败的是迫害她的敌人。
    “蝴蝶梦”也是作者杰出的作品之一，作者塑造了一个贫苦的老妇人和三个贫苦青年的光辉的形象：王老头儿被葛皇亲无辜打死，他的妻子带着三个儿子去寻找敌人，为丈夫复仇，儿子们在气愤之下打死了恶霸葛彪，被地方抓进开封府抵命，包待制根据王法，不管葛彪打死王老头子这桩公案，而只问“百姓打死平人”（特权阶级）的罪名，把王家三兄弟严刑拷打，但后来包拯终于被王母正义所感动，释放了王家三兄弟。
    作者在“救风尘”里，热情地歌颂了美丽、机智、大胆和侠义的赵盼儿，揭露了富豪恶霸周舍的贪婪、残暴和愚蠢，深深地唤起人们对封建统治阶级的憎恶心理。这是一出杰出的讽刺剧，这出戏和“窦娥冤”、“蝴蝶梦”和作者的其他杰作一起，表现了作者鲜明的人民性和战斗性，他的人道主义精神和乐观主义精神，反映在他的作品里，成为现实主义和浪漫主义紧密结合的优秀风格。
