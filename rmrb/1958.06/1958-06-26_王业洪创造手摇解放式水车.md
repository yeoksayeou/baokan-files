    Wang Yehong Creates Hand-Cranked Liberation-Style Waterwheel

    Wang Yehong is 63 years old and a handicraft worker. He was formerly the deputy director of the Cuozhen Woodworking Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui, and is now the deputy leader of the Feidong County Agricultural Machinery Research Group. He started as a carpenter at the age of fourteen, never attended school, and is still illiterate. The hand-cranked liberation-style waterwheel he created costs only 38 yuan per unit, and also saves much more pig iron than the old-fashioned ones. The old-fashioned waterwheel required two people to irrigate only four mu of paddy fields per day, while the hand-cranked liberation-style waterwheel only requires one person to operate and can irrigate six mu of paddy fields per day.

    In production, Wang Yehong saw that farmers were expending a lot of effort to draw water, and the amount of water drawn was not much, so he thought about transforming the waterwheel. It was not until this spring, when he attended the advanced producer conference in the county, that his thinking was enlightened and he began to trial-produce. The first two times were failures, but he was not discouraged and persisted in trial-production. Finally, in January of this year, he successfully manufactured the new waterwheel on his third attempt.

    王业洪创造手摇解放式水车
    王业洪，今年六十三岁，是手工业工人。原为安徽肥东县撮镇木业社副主任，现任肥东县农业机械研究组的副组长。他从十四岁起就当木工，没念过书，现在还是不识字。他创造的手摇解放式水车，每部只用三十八元，还比旧式的节省很多生铁。旧式水车两个人一天只灌四亩水田，而手摇解放式水车只要一人操作，一天即可灌六亩水田。
    在生产中王业洪看到农民车水很费力，车的水也并不多，就想到改造水车的事；直到今春到县里参加先进生产者大会，思想上得到了启发后才开始试制。头两次都失败了，但他并不灰心，始终坚持试制，终于在今年1月间第三次试制时，把新的水车制造成功了。
