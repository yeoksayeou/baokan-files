Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 1st: Farmers in Anhui Province have finally overcome the most serious wheat rust disease, and the province's 43 million mu of wheat fields are showing an unprecedented bumper harvest. Harvesting has now begun from south of the Yangtze River to north of the Huai River.

The total output of summer grain crops in Anhui this year is expected to reach about 8.5 billion jin, an increase of 62% compared with last year. Among them, the per-mu yield of wheat is estimated to increase by 60% compared with last year's 102 jin, based on the harvested areas. The province has cultivated 15 million mu of high-yield wheat fields this year, a 15-fold increase compared with last year. According to reports from various regions, among these high-yield fields, 4.5 million mu can yield more than 500 jin per mu, more than 100,000 mu can yield 1,000 jin per mu, and more than 10 million mu can yield more than 250 jin per mu.

Since the autumn sowing of wheat last year, Anhui Province encountered a severe drought of 70 days without rain. However, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, as soon as the sowing season arrived, more than 10 million agricultural cooperative members were mobilized to combat the drought and sow seeds. Not only was the wheat sown in a timely manner throughout the province, but the quality was also greatly improved compared to previous years. In the recent month, just as the province's wheat was showing a scene of bumper harvest, wheat rust disease occurred widely in various regions. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee instructed all regions to be vigilant against rust disease as early as March and made preparations in advance. After the occurrence of rust disease, all regions quickly mobilized all forces to join the battle. Party and government leaders at all levels went to the front lines to supervise the battle, inspect the prevention and control situation, and study various indigenous methods for prevention and control with the masses.

During the tense period of rust disease prevention and control throughout the province, approximately 7.78 million people participated in the battle every day, accounting for more than 50% of the total labor force. 250,000 cadres across the province participated in the battle together with the masses. The province's handicraft industry and transportation departments also fully supported the effort. During the busiest period of transportation, on the hundreds of miles of highway from Hefei to Fuyang, there was an average of one car speeding every four kilometers. The central government and various provinces also provided strong support. The central government air-lifted a large amount of sulfur to help, and on one day, as many as nine planes traveled back and forth from Guangzhou, Sichuan to Hefei. The railway transportation department also broke with convention and transported goods as soon as they arrived. The masses displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in the prevention and control of rust disease, using various indigenous methods to stop the spread of the disease. A total of more than 20 types of indigenous methods were adopted throughout the province, and these methods were used to control approximately 42% of the total wheat area. The entire province worked hard day and night to combat rust disease in the month before the wheat harvest, finally winning the final victory and achieving a bumper wheat harvest this year.

Now that the bumper harvest is a certainty, cadres and the masses throughout the province have once again joined the harvesting work. Various regions have also launched field comparison campaigns to prepare ideologically and technically for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

　　苦干一个月  赢得大丰收
    安徽战胜锈病开镰割麦
    据新华社合肥1日电  安徽省农民最后战胜危害最严重的锈病，全省四千三百万亩小麦呈现空前丰收局面。现在从江南到淮北都已开镰收割。
    安徽今年夏收粮食作物的总产量预计可达八十五亿斤左右，比去年增产62％。其中小麦亩产根据已收割的情况估计，比去年的一百零二斤提高60％。全省今年培育了一千五百万亩小麦丰产田，比去年扩大十五倍。根据各地汇报，这些丰产田中，有四百五十万亩每亩可收五百斤以上，有十万多亩每亩可收千斤，有一千多万亩每亩可收二百五十斤以上。
    安徽省从去秋种麦开始，即碰上七十天不雨的严重干旱，但在各级党委领导下，种麦季节一到，即出动了一千多万农业社员进行抗旱下种。全省小麦不但种的适时，而且质量比往年大大提高。最近一月，正当全省小麦呈现一片丰收景象的时候，各地普遍发生了小麦锈病。为了确保今年小麦丰收，安徽省委早在3月便指示各地对锈病提高警惕，及早作了准备。锈病发生后，各地很快便动员一切力量投入了战斗。各地党政领导人都亲赴前线督战，检查防治情况，和群众研究各种土办法进行防治。
    全省在防治锈病的紧张时期，每天约有七百七十八万多人参加战斗，占整半劳动力的50％以上。全省有二十五万干部和群众一起参加了战斗。全省手工业和交通运输部门也都全力支援。在运输最繁忙的时候，由合肥到阜阳的数百里公路上，平均每四公里便有一辆汽车在飞奔。中央和各省也给以大力支援。中央大量空运硫磺帮助，有一天从广州、四川到合肥来往的飞机多达九架。铁路运输部门也打破常规，随到随运。群众在防治锈病中发挥了高度积极性和创造性，利用各种土办法制止病害的蔓延，全省采用的土办法共有二十多种，用这些办法防治的面积达麦田总面积的42％左右。全省在小麦收割前的一个月对锈病日夜苦战，终于打了最后一个胜仗，赢得了今年小麦的丰收。
    现在丰收定局，全省干部和群众又一起投入收割工作。各地并展开了田头评比运动，为明年小麦大丰收在思想上和技术上进行准备工作。
