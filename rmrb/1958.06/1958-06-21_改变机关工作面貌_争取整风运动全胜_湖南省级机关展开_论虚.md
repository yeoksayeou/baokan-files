Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th - In the fourth stage of the rectification movement, cadres in Hunan provincial government offices, guided by the general line for socialist construction, launched "On Empty Talk," earnestly studying many fundamental issues in the work of various departments. This played a significant role in liberating the minds of cadres, changing the face of work in government offices, and striving for a complete victory in the rectification movement.

Since Hunan provincial government offices entered the fourth stage of the rectification movement on May 20th, they have paid attention to closely integrating the rectification with the implementation of the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, taking the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress as the main content of study, and understanding its essence as a weapon for examining, summarizing work, and improving ideology. All units have identified essential issues based on the spirit of the general line for socialist construction combined with the actual situation of the unit, as the focus of "On Empty Talk." In terms of methods, they generally adopted a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, driving progress level by level, gradually deepening, and leading cadres taking personal command and patiently guiding, thus making "On Empty Talk" quickly formed a climax and achieved great results. During "On Empty Talk", the Provincial Department of Education, many comrades realized that although education work has achieved many results in recent years, fundamental issues such as the purpose and task of running education have not been well resolved. For example, in the past, when implementing the education policy of all-round development, the strengthening of socialist ideological education and labor education for students was relaxed, resulting in a tendency for teaching to be divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. This neglected the fundamental purpose of cultivating students to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. In terms of relying on the masses to run schools, the one-sided emphasis on unification and standardization in the past few years, using only the regular middle and primary schools as one leg, and using state-run schools as one leg, greatly limited the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools and hindered the development and improvement of the quality of education. Through this "On Empty Talk," everyone realized the harm of dogmatism to education and that in order to strive for better forward leap in socialist education, it is necessary to completely liberate from the shackles of dogmatism. In "On Empty Talk," the Provincial Textile Products Trading Bureau launched a heated debate on issues such as the task of socialist commercial work and whether commercial workers should start from production when carrying out their work. Many comrades believed that socialist commerce should have a strong production viewpoint and must start from production. However, some comrades believed that the proposition of starting from production was inappropriate and that too much emphasis was placed on serving consumption. After debate, the vast majority of comrades unanimously agreed that production is the material foundation and the fundamental issue in the national economic life. Only with production can there be consumption. Only when production develops can commerce better serve consumption. If production does not develop, commerce cannot develop. Therefore, commercial workers must strengthen service to production and establish the idea of starting from production. At the same time, production and consumption are interdependent. Commercial workers should actively help production departments find raw materials, open up sales channels, and promptly reflect consumers' opinions to production departments in order to improve production and promote the development of production.

The "On Empty Talk" of the Hunan Provincial government offices shows that the errors and shortcomings in various practical work in the past are often a reflection of the struggle between the two lines and two methods of building socialism. The reason for their occurrence is mainly that political leadership is not enough, and the red flag has not been inserted in specific business work. The Provincial Department of Education recognized when checking the harm of dogmatism that in the past, more attention was paid to specific business, less attention was paid to ideology, more attention was paid to practical work, less attention was paid to empty talk, seeing things but not people, regarding education as very mysterious, not trusting the masses, and believing that only experts could run schools. The inspection of the Provincial Textile Products Trading Bureau found that because some comrades in the past did not have a strong view of serving production and there was departmentalism and a purely profit-oriented viewpoint, wanting to make more money, they often haggled with the production departments. This remnant of capitalist business ideology is contrary to the general line of socialist construction. The Provincial Department of Transportation also found in "On Empty Talk" that due to insufficient political leadership and the influence of capitalist business ideology, one-sided views such as attaching importance to long-distance transportation and neglecting short-distance transportation, attaching importance to modern tools and neglecting simple folk tools, "emphasizing roads over rivers," and "emphasizing construction over maintenance" had arisen in the work. After "On Empty Talk", everyone realized that in the future, it is necessary to take the general line of socialist construction as the guiding principle for all work, thoroughly liberate thinking, break down superstition, and strive for the continuous forward leap of various tasks.

### 改变机关工作面貌　争取整风运动全胜  湖南省级机关展开“论虚”

    改变机关工作面貌　争取整风运动全胜
    湖南省级机关展开“论虚”
    新华社长沙20日电　湖南省级机关干部在整风运动的第四阶段，以社会主义建设总路线为指导思想，展开“论虚”，认真研究了许多部门工作中一些带有根本性的问题，对于解放干部思想，改变机关工作面貌，争取整风运动的全胜，起了巨大的作用。
    湖南省级机关从5月20日转入整风第四阶段以来，就注意了使整风和贯彻中共八大二次会议精神紧密结合起来，以八大二次会议文件为主要学习内容，领会其精神实质，作为检查、总结工作和提高思想的武器。各单位都做到了根据社会主义建设总路线的精神结合本单位的实际情况找出本质问题，作为“论虚”的重点。在方法上，一般都是采取上下结合、逐级带动、逐步深入，领导干部亲自挂帅，循循诱导，因此使“论虚”很快形成高潮，取得了很大的成绩。省教育厅在“论虚”中，许多同志都认识到：几年来教育工作取得了很多成绩，但是像办教育事业的目的是什么、任务是什么等根本问题，并没有很好地解决。如过去在贯彻全面发展的教育方针时，放松了对学生加强社会主义思想教育和劳动教育，使教学上产生了脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的倾向，这就忽略了把学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者这一根本目的。在依靠群众办学方面，由于几年来片面地强调统一，强调正规，只用正规中、小学一条腿走路，用国家办学一条腿走路，因此，大大地限制了群众办学的积极性，妨碍了教育事业的发展和质量的提高。通过这次“论虚”，使大家认识到教条主义对教育事业的危害性，要争取社会主义教育事业更好地向前跃进，就必须彻底地从教条主义的束缚中解放出来。省纺织品贸易局在“论虚”中，曾就社会主义商业工作的任务是什么、商业工作者进行工作时应不应该从生产出发等问题，展开了热烈的辩论。许多同志认为社会主义商业应该有强烈的生产观点，必须从生产出发。但是有的同志却认为从生产出发的提法不恰当，过多地强调为消费服务。经过辩论，绝大多数同志一致认为：生产是物质基础，是国民经济生活中的根本问题，有生产才有消费，只有生产发展了，商业才能更好地为消费服务，生产不发展，商业也就不能发展，因此，商业工作者必须加强为生产服务，树立从生产出发的思想。同时，生产和消费是互相依存的，商业工作者应该积极帮助生产部门找原料，打开销路，并及时把消费者的意见反映给生产部门，以便改进生产，促进生产的发展。
    湖南省级机关的“论虚”表明：过去各种实际工作中的错误和缺点，常常是建设社会主义两条路线两种方法的斗争的反映。其产生的原因主要是政治挂帅不够，在具体的业务工作中没有插上红旗。省教育厅在检查教条主义的危害时就认识到，过去是具体业务抓得多，思想抓得少，务实多，务虚少，见物不见人，把教育工作看得很神秘，不相信群众，认为只有专家才能办学。省纺织品贸易局的检查发现，由于过去有些同志为生产服务的观点不强，存在着本位主义和单纯利润观点，想多赚些钱，经常和生产部门扯皮，这种资本主义经营思想的残余是和社会主义建设总路线相违背的。省交通厅在“论虚”中也发现由于政治挂帅不够，受资本主义经营思想的影响，在工作上曾经产生重视长途运输、忽视短途运输，重视现代化工具，忽视民间简陋工具，“重路轻河”，“重修轻养”等片面观点。经过“论虚”大家都认识到：今后必须以社会主义建设总路线为提起一切工作的纲，彻底解放思想，破除迷信，争取各项工作不断地向前跃进。
