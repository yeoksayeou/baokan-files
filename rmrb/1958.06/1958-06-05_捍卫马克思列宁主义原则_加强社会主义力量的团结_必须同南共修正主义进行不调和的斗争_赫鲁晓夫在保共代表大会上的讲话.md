Dear comrades and friends!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of our entire party, and on behalf of the Soviet people, to extend warm fraternal greetings to the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, to the members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and to the entire Bulgarian people. We wish your congress every success in its work. (Stormy, prolonged applause. Everyone stands up.)

Our party, the Soviet people, and the people of all socialist countries are sincerely glad of the outstanding achievements of the Bulgarian Communist Party before the convening of its Seventh Congress.

The socialist countries are not far from overtaking the most developed capitalist countries.

Under the leadership of its Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have made great strides on the path to building a socialist society. The Soviet working people sincerely congratulate the Bulgarian people on their historic victories. (Prolonged applause.)

The rapid development of the economy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the continuous improvement of the material well-being of the people, and the rise in the cultural level, as clearly pointed out by Comrade Zhivkov in the report of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, once again convincingly prove the superiority of socialism over capitalism. (Prolonged applause.)

The lackeys of the bourgeoisie like to boast about the alleged superiority of the free-enterprise system. According to them, this system is the pinnacle of human ideals, and nothing, nor can anything, be better than this. But why can't they point to a single capitalist country that has achieved such great successes in economic development in such a short time as those countries that have taken the socialist path? For example, take Bulgaria's neighbors, Greece and Turkey. Statistical data objectively reflect the fact that the people of Bulgaria, who have taken the path of socialist development, have achieved much greater successes in economic and cultural development than their capitalist neighbors. (Applause.)

In the socialist countries, industrial output has increased by more than three times compared to the pre-war level, while in the capitalist countries, despite the frenzied arms race and other "stimulus" methods, industrial output has increased by less than one time.

We firmly believe that the time is not far off when the socialist countries will overtake the most developed capitalist countries not only in speed but also in industrial output. (Applause) Our conviction is based on facts. The Soviet Union has already greatly approached the most powerful capitalist country, the United States, not only in total industrial output but also in the output of products per capita. (Applause) Our achievements in the development of science and technology are well known. The Soviet Union now has all the necessary conditions to solve the main economic tasks in the shortest historical period—to overtake and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the output of products per capita. (Prolonged applause) The People's Republic of China is now striving to overtake and surpass Britain in steel and other important industrial products within fifteen years. (Applause) The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has already overtaken Sweden, France, and West Germany in steel production per capita, and in electricity production, it has overtaken France and Italy. (Applause)

With the expansion of socialism beyond the borders of a single country and the formation of the world socialist camp, new and significant conditions have emerged to accelerate the development of the socialist economy. These conditions must be utilized rationally and economically.

In this regard, I would like to discuss some issues related to economic cooperation among socialist countries.

Recently, a meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of the member countries of the Economic Mutual Assistance Council was held in Moscow. Representatives from the Communist Party of China, the Workers' Party of Korea, the Labor Party of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party also participated in this meeting. The meeting unanimously agreed that the economic ties between the socialist countries have greatly expanded and strengthened, and in this situation, the further improvement of the forms of economic cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp, and the further specialization and cooperation of the relevant departments of the national economies, have acquired particular importance. The resolute implementation of the measures for further developing and strengthening the international division of labor among the socialist countries, as formulated by the meeting, will ensure the most rational use of natural and economic resources, increase labor productivity, and further improve the well-being of the peoples of our countries. The rational organization of economic cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp will undoubtedly accelerate the development of the productive forces in each country and strengthen the economic power of the entire socialist camp.

The recent Moscow meeting, like the November meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties, demonstrated the indestructible unity of the peoples of the socialist countries and their deep concern for the further strengthening of their common family, the development, and improvement of cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp. (Prolonged applause)

The bourgeois ideologues claim that the formation and consolidation of the socialist camp limit the autonomy and national independence of the countries within this camp. The entire practice of the development of cooperation among the socialist countries since the formation of the world socialist system convincingly proves that it is precisely socialism that has brought true national independence to the peoples. The socialist camp is a voluntary alliance of equal and autonomous countries. In this alliance, no country seeks or strives for any special rights, privileges, or advantages. It goes without saying that each socialist country independently determines the forms of its cooperation with other socialist countries. There is, and can be, no coercion in this matter.

However, if each socialist country were to act independently, as the saying goes, "each sweeping before its own door," would the rich potential within the socialist countries be fully utilized to achieve the victory of socialism? In the current international conditions, would it be possible to reliably defend the achievements of socialism if the socialist countries acted independently? Of course, this is impossible.

Only the unity of the socialist countries can maximize the advantages of the world socialist system, increase its strength in the struggle to prevent a new war and in the economic competition with capitalism. Life convincingly shows that the strengthening of unity among the countries of the socialist camp not only does not harm the national interests of any of them but, on the contrary, is a reliable guarantee of their national independence and sovereignty. (Stormy applause)

The communist and workers' parties unanimously believe that only the unity of the socialist countries, the strengthening of comprehensive cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance among them based on the great principles of proletarian internationalism, can ensure the common rise of the socialist economy, enable the previously backward countries to catch up with the advanced level, and can eliminate the actual inequalities in the level of economic and cultural development that exist among them.

The unity of the socialist countries is primarily ensured by the unity of the communist and workers' parties, which is based on the unshakable and historically tested principles of Marxism-Leninism. Each party creatively applies the common principles of Marxism-Leninism, develops the most reasonable specific forms of these principles under its own conditions, and thus makes its own contribution to the theory and practice of socialist construction and to the development of Marxism-Leninism. (Applause)

Our great teacher V.I. Lenin particularly valued the revolutionary creativity of the masses in the struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution and the victory of the new social system. Lenin wrote: "Marxism differs from all other socialist theories in that it brilliantly combines two features: on the one hand, it has a completely scientific and sober understanding of the objective situation and objective evolution; on the other hand, it gives the most resolute recognition to the revolutionary will, revolutionary creativity, and revolutionary initiative of the masses..." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 13, pp. 21-22; Chinese edition, Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 2, pp. 2001-2002)

The creative development of Marxist-Leninist theory is the cause of the entire international communist movement of all the revolutionary parties of the working class. (Applause) For example, everyone knows how greatly the Communist Party of China has contributed to the theory and practice of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, skillfully combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the revolution and socialist construction in its own country. The creative solutions to the problems of the transitional period by the communist and workers' parties of the European and Asian socialist countries, including the experience of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the socialist transformation of agriculture, have great value for the development of the theory of Marxism-Leninism. (Applause)

The forms of agricultural production cooperativization adopted and implemented by the People's Republic of Bulgaria are an example of the correct combination of the universal laws of agricultural socialist transformation with the specific conditions and characteristics of Bulgaria. (Applause) Your party's experience once again proves that, regardless of national characteristics, there is no other way to attract the broad masses of peasants to socialism except through the Leninist cooperative plan, which has been tested by life. (Prolonged applause)

The brother communist and workers' parties consider the resolutions of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to be of great significance for the development of Marxism-Leninism. They point out that these resolutions laid the foundation for a new stage in the international communist movement and promoted its further development.

The communist and workers' parties of the capitalist countries have developed the ways and methods of the struggle for power by the working class in the current environment, enriching Lenin's theory of socialist revolution.

The declaration of the meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of the socialist countries correctly points out: "The creative application of the common laws of socialist construction, tested by life experience, and the diversity of forms and methods of socialist construction in various countries, is a collective contribution to the theory of Marxism-Leninism." Each communist party has its share in this, and the experience of socialist construction in each country also has its share. (Applause)

The strength and significance of the declaration lie in the fact that it summarizes the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the experience of the international workers' movement and the communist movement, and the experience of the world national liberation movement. In this historically significant document, the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism are further creatively developed to adapt to the conditions of our time.

When talking about the creative development of Marxist-Leninist theory under modern conditions, one cannot ignore the extremely erroneous views contained in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist Party. This draft states that "in recent decades, Marxist thought has lagged behind the development of modern society." It further states that "in the further scientific and Marxist elucidation of modern social problems, especially in the elucidation of the laws and contradictions of the transition from capitalism to socialism, many gaps have appeared."

In recent decades, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the entire international communist movement have indeed made many new contributions to the theory of Marxism-Leninism. How can one say that the development of Marxist-Leninist thought, especially in the study of the laws of the transitional period, has lagged behind in these years?

In these years, the Soviet Union has, for the first time in human history, built socialism. (Stormy applause) Many countries in Europe and Asia, under the leadership of the communist parties, have seized power through revolution, and new forms of proletarian dictatorship, the people's democratic system, have appeared and developed. Socialism has gone beyond the borders of a single country and has become a world system.

The Communist Party of China and the brother parties of the people's democratic countries have widely implemented the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and have found special forms to realize Lenin's cooperative plan. In all the people's democratic countries, forms of unity such as the Fatherland Front and the National Front, led by Marxist-Leninist parties, have developed to unite the working people in the struggle for socialism.

The claim that there are "gaps" in the development of Marxism-Leninism is obviously contrary to the facts. Does this not prove that the Yugoslav leadership ignores the practice and experience of socialist construction in other countries and the experience of the brother communist and workers' parties?

The draft program of the Yugoslav Communist Party and the speeches of the Yugoslav leaders at the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party attempt to label the communist and workers' parties of other socialist countries as "pragmatists."

It seems that the Yugoslav comrades consider it "pragmatism" for the communist and workers' parties of the socialist countries to focus their main efforts on drafting and implementing practical measures to ensure economic and cultural development and improve the well-being of the people. We believe that this "pragmatism" is in the fundamental interests of the people and the interests of socialism. The working masses judge the superiority of the socialist system, judge that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system, based on who holds power, who controls the means of production, based on the results of the development of the national economy, the achievements of science and technology, and based on the fact that the cultural level and well-being of the working people in the socialist countries are steadily increasing. (Stormy applause)

In our view, solving the various problems of socialist and communist construction in theory and practice is the true creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

We communists consider revolutionary theory to be of great significance, and it is precisely because we have consistently adhered to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism that we have achieved various successes. Marxism-Leninism theory is our compass, our guiding light. The power of Marxism-Leninism lies in its inseparable connection with life, with the process of social development. (Applause)

Everyone knows that the working people, when they did not yet have a sufficient understanding of the theory of scientific communism, were already inclined towards socialism. The workers wanted to get rid of capitalism, to get rid of its incurable sufferings and sores. They were looking for a way out of the desperate situation of capitalism. Only when the revolutionary party, armed with the theory of scientific communism, correctly organized the workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and led them in the struggle to build a new life, did the theory of Marxism-Leninism become a theory that the broadest masses of the working people could understand.

Marxist parties attract the working masses to engage in revolutionary struggle in practice, guide them to solve the concrete tasks of transforming society, and this creates a condition in which workers and peasants can understand not only in theory but also from their own experience the correctness and vitality of the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism. On the basis of revolutionary struggle and the practice of socialist construction, theoretical principles are further developed.

The Russian working class, in alliance with the working peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party, which creatively applied and developed Marxist theory, seized power in October 1917 to reorganize the economy and the entire national life on a socialist basis.

Even in the early days of the Soviet government, the great Lenin, when formulating the plan for socialist construction, proposed an extremely important task: the development of heavy industry—the foundation of the foundation of the national economy. Under his leadership, a specific plan for the electrification of our country was formulated, which Lenin called the party's second program. Does this not show that Lenin studied the problems of socialist construction theory and practice as an indivisible whole?

After the working class seized power, the socialist state had to solve many problems of economic and cultural construction. The theory of Marxism-Leninism was realized and further developed in the process of socialist construction.

In the forty years since the establishment of the Soviet state, our party has done tremendous work, mobilizing the creative efforts of the Soviet people to build a socialist society.

For example, one can cite some of the problems recently solved by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party has carried out a major reorganization of the management of industry and construction, which has produced tremendous economic results. Is this a theoretical problem or a practical problem? This is a problem of great practical and theoretical significance.

Our party has implemented a series of major measures in agriculture, the results of which have unleashed tremendous potential and possibilities. Soviet agriculture is now in a great leap forward. In early 1955, a six-year plan for the development of animal husbandry was formulated. Due to the implementation of the measures drafted by the party on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism for managing the socialist economy, and due to the deep understanding of the necessity of these measures by the masses, the six-year plan for the production of milk and dairy products was completed in three years ahead of schedule. (Applause)

A year ago, the advanced collective farms and state farms of the Soviet Union proposed a task: to overtake and surpass the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita in the next few years, and this task has been supported by the Central Committee of the party. We believe that this task will be successfully completed. (Applause)

So, is this a practical problem or a theoretical problem? We believe that this is primarily a practical problem. Since the national economy of the socialist countries is thriving, social wealth is increasing year by year, the remuneration for labor is higher and higher, and the well-being of the working people is constantly improving, this means that the positions of socialism are being strengthened, and the principles of Marxism-Leninism theory are being realized. Everyone sees that these are major theoretical problems. (Applause)

Not long ago, at the initiative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a law was passed on the further development of the collective farm system and the reorganization of the machine-tractor stations. Now, machines are sold directly to the collective farms, and the machine-tractor stations have been transformed into technical repair stations. The spring field work of the collective farms shows that this measure is completely correct. The collective farms use tractors and other agricultural machinery not worse, but better than the machine-tractor stations. So, is this problem only a practical problem or only a theoretical problem? No, this problem is both a theoretical problem of socialist construction and a practical problem. (Shouts of "Right," applause)

At the May Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a grand plan for the development of the Soviet chemical industry was adopted. The implementation of this plan will ensure the further development of technology in many sectors of our national economy and the possibility of more rapidly solving the task of increasing the production of consumer goods.

At first glance, all these problems are purely practical problems, but at the same time, they are also theoretical problems. Here, there are two aspects of a whole—theory and practice. We vividly demonstrate the superiority of our theoretical ideas by our achievements in the development of industry, agriculture, and culture, demonstrating the power and vitality of the theory of Marxism-Leninism as the foundation of the construction of a socialist society. We use this theory in practice, develop the socialist economy, and pave the way to the future, which is to affirm and develop revolutionary theory, enriching it with the experience of millions of people. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Every practical problem of socialist construction is also directly related to the creative development of Marxism-Leninism. It is not possible to separate these two.

Theory without practice is a fruitless flower. Everyone knows that there is often such a situation: in the garden, flowers bloom, and people see the tree laden with flowers and are very happy. They wait for autumn to come and will bear abundant fruit, rewarding people for their labor. But after the flowering period, people see that the flowers have withered without forming a fruit. This is a very sad thing, because people feel that their beautiful hopes and expectations have become bubbles. When the orchard is in full bloom and fragrant, people have been very happy, looking forward to a bountiful harvest. However, the orchard did not bring this fruit. The labor expended on cultivation was in vain, because the orchard they cultivated could not repay the effort they had expended.

People are also similarly disappointed with theorists who are all show and no substance. (Laughter in the hall) Sometimes, after listening to the flowery language and eloquent speeches of certain theorists, people are very happy and begin to believe in the loud words of these people. But later, they will understand that in practice, these beautiful words are completely useless. (The hall becomes lively, applause) Beautiful rhetoric turns into empty promises detached from life. Once people realize that these "theorists'" beautiful words are just flowers without fruit, just empty talk, they will leave these "theorists" and their "theory." (The audience shouts, "Right," prolonged applause)

The revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism is great and invincible precisely because it is inseparably connected with life, with the process of social development, and has been tested by this life. (Applause)

Practice, if not illuminated by advanced revolutionary theory, will inevitably fall into a state of groping in the dark. The theory of Marxism-Leninism shows the working class and the laborers the way to solve the practical tasks of building socialism and communism. (Applause) But theory without practice is also a dead, useless theory.

Lenin mocked those who, detached from life, fell into abstract theoretical speculation, saying: "We insist that the practical movement of the masses is no less important than theory, and only this practice can give our principles a serious test. 'My friend, theory is gray, but the tree of life is evergreen.'" (Applause) (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 20, pp. 495-496)

In the history of human society, there have been many times when seemingly correct theoretical principles have been proposed, but they have not arisen from life itself and have not been verified by practice. Such theoretical principles have brought no benefit to humanity and have quickly died out.

The vitality of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in the fact that it arose in the process of the struggle of the working class and developed in an inseparable connection with practice, answering the most urgent questions of humanity. The correctness of the principles of Marxist-Leninist theory has been proven by the struggle for the construction of a communist society. It has been proven by the extremely rich experience of our party and all the brother parties of the socialist countries. It has also been proven by the experience of the communist parties of the capitalist countries, which, guided by this revolutionary theory, lead the working class and all the laboring people in the struggle to liberate themselves from capitalist slavery and to build a socialist society.

Communism is not an abstract philosophical concept; it contains a definite content, which is the necessity to eliminate the exploiting class and the phenomenon of man exploiting man, and to establish such a social system in which all material and spiritual wealth created is public wealth, and the creators of this wealth can dispose of it according to their own will, enjoy the full fruits of their labor, and each contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs.

Communism is the radiant future that humanity yearns for. (Stormy applause)

Some "theorists" try in every possible way to belittle the practical activities of the communist and workers' parties in the construction of socialism, contemptuously calling this activity "pragmatism." But they themselves are neither willing to analyze this problem from a theoretical angle nor from a practical angle: why do they receive the favors of the imperialist countries? (The entire hall is lively, shouts of "Right," stormy applause)

But every conscious worker understands that it is impossible to raise the level of the socialist economy in this way. Can one speak of socialist achievements here, can one speak of the development of Marxist-Leninist theory! If these poor theorists often do not understand the harm that their "theory" can bring to the cause of the working class, then the imperialist bloc is well aware of what they hope for and is making every effort to support and encourage those who can help them in their anti-communist schemes.

I do not want to offend anyone, but I cannot help but raise a question that excites all honest communists. Why do the leaders of imperialism, while trying to eradicate all socialist countries from the face of the earth and suppress the communist movement, at the same time provide assistance to a socialist country, giving it preferential loans and gratuitous favors? (Laughter, applause) After all, no one believes that there are two kinds of socialism in the world: one that the world reactionaries are madly hostile to, and another that imperialism can accept, support, and assist. (Laughter, applause)

Everyone knows that imperialists, at any time and to anyone, will not give money just for "beautiful eyes," their capital will only be invested in those enterprises where they expect to gain a profit. (The hall is lively, applause)

If the imperialists agree to "help" a socialist country in this way, then they certainly do not do this to strengthen it. One cannot imagine that the American monopolies would be interested in strengthening socialism and developing Marxist-Leninist theory. (Laughter and applause in the hall)

The representatives of this country claim that we have deviated from Marxism-Leninism, while they are on the correct position. As a result, a strange situation arises: the imperialists want to "develop" Marxism-Leninism through this country. (Laughter) Here, one can recall a very correct statement by Bebel: if the enemy praises you, then you have probably done something stupid. (Laughter, prolonged applause)

When the imperialists unite to attack socialism, to attack the working class, some who call themselves socialist warriors try to weaken the will of the working class in the anti-capitalist struggle, weaken the vanguard of the working class—the communist and workers' parties, dull their vigilance, weaken the unity of the socialist countries.

The bourgeois aggressor bloc, relying on such allies, can truly hope for something and rejoice that their attempts to sabotage the socialist countries from within may be realized. But I must say in private that the imperialists' hopes in this regard are also doomed to failure, and the funds they have invested in this "enterprise" are wasted. Whenever the imperialists try to bet on weakening the unity of the communist and workers' parties, they always get such a result. (Stormy, prolonged applause. Shouts of "Right!" The delegates and guests stand up, rhythmically chanting "Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Communist Party of the Soviet Union!")

The communist parties of all countries cherish and maintain the unity of their ranks as they would their own eyes. They are waging an uncompromising struggle against revisionism and dogmatism. In this struggle, the communist parties, of course, direct their main fire at the revisionists who act as spies for the imperialist camp. Many people know the ancient story of the Trojan Horse. When the enemy could not capture Troy by siege and assault, they sent a wooden horse to the Trojans, hiding their people inside it, who opened the city gates at night.

Title: Modern Revisionism is a Trojan Horse

Modern revisionism is a Trojan horse. (Cries of "Right!" and applause) Revisionists attempt to undermine revolutionary parties from within, disrupt unity, and cause Marxist-Leninist ideology to become scattered and chaotic. (Cries of "It won't work!" and applause)

Comrades! The Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries have unanimously condemned revisionism in their historic declaration, stating that it is the primary danger to the international communist movement under modern conditions. Revisionism is right-wing opportunism, a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, which paralyzes the revolutionary spirit of the working class and advocates for the maintenance or restoration of capitalism. The declaration correctly emphasizes that "the existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism. Yielding to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign root of revisionism."

Communists from all countries enthusiastically support the declaration adopted by the conference of brother parties from socialist countries, recognizing this declaration as the most important programmatic document of the international communist movement. The declaration provides a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the basic laws of modern social development and clearly defines the tasks of the world communist movement.

All the Communist and Workers' Parties unanimously and resolutely condemn the revisionist views and evil stance of the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Among all the Communist and Workers' Parties, only one party—the League of Communists of Yugoslavia—has expressed disagreement with this declaration, thus placing itself in opposition to all Marxist-Leninist parties in the world. The stance of the Yugoslav leadership was most vividly reflected in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and in the work of the Seventh Congress of the LCY.

The Communist and Workers' Parties have shown complete unity and resolutely condemn the revisionist points in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the evil stance of the Yugoslav leadership.

Comrades, at this point, allow me to express some views on the relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. I think it is appropriate to discuss these views at your congress because this concerns not only the relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but also the relations between the brother parties and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

As indicated above, the unanimous views of the brother parties have been reflected in their declaration, and their unanimous views on many important issues today have been formed on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles.

Marx, Engels, and Lenin have always considered it of paramount importance to struggle for the purity of the scientific communist ideological principles. They waged an uncompromising struggle against all attempts to drain the revolutionary soul from the fighting theory of the working class. They taught that the scientific communist theory is the main ideological weapon of the working class in its struggle for the liberation of its class and for the communist transformation of society. They taught that without a revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.

We all know how great a struggle Lenin waged against international revisionism, against the opportunism of Bernstein and Kautsky, and defended the revolutionary, creative Marxism. In this uncompromising ideological struggle, the Marxist-Leninist parties of the working class grew stronger, more consolidated, and tempered, and now these parties have become a powerful organizational and inspirational force in the international workers' movement.

The Communist and Workers' Parties, faithful to the teachings of our teachers and leaders, vigilantly protect the purity of Marxist-Leninist principles and are very sensitive to any distortion or deviation from these principles. Marxist-Leninist parties have consistently and resolutely opposed those who attempt to weaken the unity of the brother parties, disrupt the international unity of the working class of various countries, and undermine their revolutionary struggle. Particularly dangerous to the revolutionary movement are those who, while calling themselves Marxist-Leninists, actually play the role of agents of the class enemy in the workers' movement, regardless of their intentions. Therefore, the Communist and Workers' Parties are very serious and uncompromising on theoretical issues and in their struggle against any attempts to revise Marxism-Leninism. (Applause)

Our parties and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have a history. Now we should recall some important moments in this history.

You know that before 1948, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union had good relations, which were formed during the common struggle against the fascist invaders during the Second World War and in the early post-war years. In September 1947, when the imperialist reactionaries began to intensify their attacks on the socialist countries, the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies, as well as some Communist Parties of the European capitalist countries, organized the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties. Initially, its working bodies were located in Belgrade.

Looking back, we must say that in the history of the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement, in the struggle to unite the Communist and Workers' Parties on the basis of proletarian internationalism, and in the struggle for lasting peace, democracy, and socialism, the Information Bureau played a positive role in a certain period. (Prolonged applause)

The Communist Party of Yugoslavia, like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and many other brother parties, was one of the organizers of the Information Bureau and actively participated in its early activities. This was the situation before 1948. Later, the relations between the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the other brother parties began to deteriorate.

The resolution of the Information Bureau on the situation in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1948 was basically correct

In 1948, the Information Bureau adopted a resolution "On the Situation in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia," which made a fair criticism of the activities of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on a series of principled issues. This resolution was basically correct and in the interests of the revolutionary movement. Later, from 1949 to 1953, conflicts arose between the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the other brother parties, during which mistakes were made in the struggle and harmful grievances appeared that were detrimental to our common cause.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union fully recognizes its responsibility to the two countries and peoples and to the international communist movement, and therefore has shown initiative to eliminate this conflict, strive to restore normal relations between the two countries, and establish contacts and cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

For this purpose, at our initiative, representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia held talks in May-June 1955 and signed the Belgrade Declaration. It is extremely important to note that during the Belgrade talks, Comrade Tito advocated not to reopen old accounts but to start our relations on a new basis. We were happy to agree to this and, from our side, did everything possible to strengthen friendly relations between the two sides. At the same time, we recognized that there were ideological differences between the two parties on a series of major issues. We showed great patience and forbearance in order to achieve unity of views on a principled basis, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.

However, life has shown that the Yugoslav leaders have carried too heavy a burden from the past and are unable to free themselves from their erroneous positions to stand firmly on the Marxist-Leninist position. Even after the normalization of relations, the Yugoslav leaders continued to make anti-Soviet statements and attack the socialist camp and the brother parties. During the Hungarian events, the Yugoslav leaders caused particularly great harm to the socialist cause with their public statements and actions.

During the Budapest counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Yugoslav embassy had essentially become the center for those who launched the struggle against the people's democratic system in Hungary and a refuge for the Nagy-Losonczy capitulationist rebel group. Recall the unprecedented speech by Comrade Tito in Pula, where he defended the Hungarian rebels, while the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union to the Hungarian people was called "Soviet intervention." In this speech, he directly called on certain forces in other socialist countries to follow the so-called "Yugoslav path."

Comrades, we all understand what kind of path this is. Let those who want to follow this path do so. However, the parties that truly adhere to the Marxist-Leninist position will not follow this path. (Applause) We socialist countries resolutely follow the Marxist-Leninist compass pointing to communism. (Prolonged applause)

Due to the stance of the Yugoslav leadership, we were forced to publicly criticize their views and actions. Our stance was fully supported by all the Communist and Workers' Parties. Thus, it is not the brother parties adhering to the Marxist-Leninist position, but the Yugoslav leadership itself, with its divisive activities against the socialist countries and brother parties, that placed Yugoslavia and the LCY in a position of isolation from all socialist countries and the international communist movement.

Later, at the initiative of the Yugoslav leadership, in March 1957, the well-known meeting between the Soviet delegation and the Yugoslav delegation was held in Bucharest. During this meeting, we frankly explained to the Yugoslav leadership our views on the policy of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in the Hungarian question and other questions. The result of the talks was a consensus on the basic issues of the modern international situation, although it was acknowledged that there were still some differences on ideological issues.

During the Bucharest meeting, we hoped to find a common language and clear the way for further development of friendly cooperation. At the same time, we openly told the Yugoslav leadership that if they continued to attack the socialist camp countries and brother parties in the future, we would necessarily respond to any such statement. I now declare with full responsibility to our respected, brave, and loyal brothers in the Bulgarian Communist Party that we will do so. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

During the Bucharest meeting, it was agreed that the LCY delegation would participate in the preparation of the upcoming conference of the brother parties of the socialist countries and in the drafting of the declaration of this conference.

However, subsequent events showed that the Yugoslav leadership reneged on the agreed position. After the Yugoslav leadership refused to sign the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries, it decided to present its own program of action—the draft program of the LCY, which contradicted the unanimous views of the Marxist-Leninist parties and attempted to be a programmatic document for the international communist and workers' movement.

Of course, the draft program of the LCY is an internal matter of the Yugoslav communists. However, since this draft program contains malicious and insulting evaluations of other parties and socialist countries and makes revisions to the foundations of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, our party considers it our direct responsibility to criticize the anti-Marxist principles of this document. The principled position of our party, as explained in the letter of the CPSU Central Committee and in our party's press, has received the unanimous support and approval of all the Communist and Workers' Parties.

The Yugoslav leadership rejected the fraternal, principled criticism of the brother parties and continued to stubbornly adhere to its erroneous, anti-Marxist views, thus falling into isolation again. The Yugoslav leadership, instead of seriously analyzing the causes that led the LCY into this difficult situation, tried to blame the brother parties for taking an unobjective attitude and interfering in the internal affairs of the LCY. This is like the saying, "blaming others for one's own illness!" (The hall is lively)

Some comrades in Yugoslavia have tried to find differences in the assessment of their errors by various Communist and Workers' Parties. They attack the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, trying to single out the Communist Party of China, claiming that the Communist Party of China criticizes their errors in a special way. However, attempts to find any subtle differences in the criticism of modern revisionism by the brother parties are in vain. On this point, all the brother parties are unanimous. We believe that the criticism of the revisionist principles of the draft program of the LCY by the comrades from China, as well as by other brother parties, is quite correct and profound, and is a consistent defense of the principles of Marxism-Leninism. We fully agree with this principled criticism. The strength of socialism, the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, can only be strengthened in the struggle against revisionism, in the struggle to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory. (Prolonged applause)

Recently, in the organ of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the weekly "Communist," an article was published to commemorate the third anniversary of the signing of the Belgrade Declaration. At first glance, it seems that the article is written in a calm manner, aiming to ease the tension that has already arisen between the LCY and the other brother parties. However, in reality, this article is extremely incorrect, as it attempts to justify the erroneous position of the Yugoslav leadership.

For example, the article claims that the struggle for peace is the basic content of the struggle for socialism. This statement cannot be agreed with.

Undoubtedly, those who struggle for socialism are consistently struggling for the cause of peace. However, among those who struggle for peace, there are also many who do not support socialist principles. Even some conservative individuals, religious believers, various bourgeois social activists and politicians, also struggle for peace. Of course, we unite with them in the struggle for peace. Therefore, people and organizations with various views and political beliefs can and should unite in the struggle for peace, and they are now united.

As for the struggle for the victory of socialism, that is another matter. Here, one cannot expect the working class and the capitalists, the Communist Party and the bourgeois parties to unite. The struggle for the victory of socialism requires the unity of views and actions of the working-class parties standing on the Marxist-Leninist position, the consistent implementation of the principles of proletarian internationalism and mutual assistance of the peoples of all countries building socialism. (Applause)

Our consistent position is: in the struggle for peace and the security of the peoples of all countries, we should strive to strengthen cooperation between countries. We hope to maintain such relations with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as well. However, as communists, we hope for more: we hope for mutual understanding and cooperation in the party sphere. The Yugoslav communists have a lot of revolutionary experience and have made great contributions to the struggle against our common class enemy. The working class and the entire working people of Yugoslavia made a significant contribution to the struggle against fascism during the Second World War. Of course, if cooperation in the party sphere is not successful, then we will maintain and develop normal relations with Yugoslavia in the state sphere. At the same time, we frankly declare that we will not agree to any compromises on ideological issues, and we will defend the unity of the Marxist-Leninist parties and struggle for the purity of the revolutionary theory.

Comrades! I recall a conversation I had with the leaders of the LCY in 1956, when we exchanged views and had a friendly conversation. When discussing our differences, I then asked Comrade Tito to pay more attention to a deeper analysis of events and our mutual relations, to correctly assess the situation that has formed, in order to achieve a quicker unity of views on a principled basis. At that time, I thought of a well-known analogy: "The entire platoon marches in step, but one soldier is out of step." Who should adjust the step: the platoon following the soldier or the soldier following the platoon? (The hall is lively) Comrade Koca Popović, who attended this meeting, asked a question:

Who is the platoon, and who is the soldier?

My answer to this counter-question was:

Think for yourself who is the platoon and who is the soldier.

I said that in any case, every soldier knows that the platoon is the platoon, and a soldier is only a member of this platoon, therefore it should not be the platoon following the soldier, but the opposite. (The hall is lively. Applause) If you are on another position, then you say directly that you are not a soldier in this communist platoon that marches in step under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. (Prolonged applause)

We will always sacredly defend the unity of our great international communist army of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, China, Bulgaria, and other socialist countries, all the Communist Parties of the world, are united and resolutely oppose modern revisionism. The communists of all countries, under the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, confidently march towards their sublime goal. (Prolonged applause)

The loyalty of the BCP to the socialist cause is deeply respected by the parties of all countries; the relations between the CPSU and the BCP have always been truly fraternal

Comrades! The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party will summarize an important period in the socialist construction of Bulgaria and set the course for Bulgaria's further advance towards socialism. Undoubtedly, the new tasks you have set will be successfully solved by the Bulgarian people, who are closely united around the fighting Communist Party. (Stormy applause)

The working class and the entire people of Bulgaria have the right to be proud of their Communist Party. (Stormy applause) For decades, this party has been tempered in the cruel struggle against the imperialist reactionaries and the fascist forces, and it has led the working class and the laboring peasants to fight for a free, socialist Bulgaria. Your party has many outstanding sons who have given their lives for the great cause of the working class.

Your party was brought up by Dimitrov Blagoev and Georgi Dimitrov with unconditional loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and uncompromisingness towards any betrayal of it. This excellent quality has been manifested with new strength in the struggle of the Bulgarian communists for the construction of socialism and for the unbreakable friendship and unity of all socialist countries, Communist and Workers' Parties. The Bulgarian Communist Party has earned the deep respect of the international communist movement and all the brother parties with its Leninist internationalist policy and loyalty to our common cause. (Prolonged applause)

We, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as a brother party that has always maintained close ties with the Bulgarian Communist Party, are pleased to note that the correct line and policy of the BCP in the issues of socialist construction in the People's Republic of Bulgaria and in the issues of the international communist and workers' movement prove the Marxist-Leninist maturity of the leadership of the BCP, prove that its Central Committee is good at creatively exploring and applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism in practice. (Prolonged applause)

We are convinced that the Bulgarian Communist Party will more tightly unite its ranks around this tested leadership, achieve new and greater victories in the socialist construction of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and will always be at the forefront of the international communist movement. (Stormy applause)

The relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Bulgarian Communist Party have always been the best, truly fraternal relations. Even when the great son of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, led the Bulgarian Communist Party, our relations were like this, and after his death, under the leadership of the faithful followers of Dimitrov, the faithful Marxist-Leninists who led the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, these relations remained the same. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Let me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, express my joy that there has always been full understanding and brotherly alliance between our two parties and two countries on all issues. No matter what issues we discuss with each other, we always see that the representatives of the brotherly Bulgarian Communist Party treat these issues in the same way as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, that is, in the same way as the Marxist-Leninist position. (Stormy, prolonged applause, shouts of approval, everyone stands up)

This understanding of our common tasks is based on the consistent implementation of the principles of Marxism-Leninism, which we follow, and which the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, led by the Political Bureau and First Secretary Todor Zhivkov, has consistently implemented. (Stormy applause) Our state relations with the People's Republic of Bulgaria are also developing exceptionally harmoniously. Between our two countries, just as between our two parties, there have been no disagreements, not even a shadow of disagreement. The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, led by Comrade Todor Zhikov, consistently pursues this line in all issues of domestic development and international relations, guided by the interests of the people and the country, and the interests of world peace. (Applause)

We have never had different views with the Bulgarian comrades: our views and assessments have always been the same. This is understandable because our two countries are led by such parties that stand firmly on the Marxist-Leninist position, stand on the position of strengthening the fraternal relations between the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, the socialist countries, stand on the position of proletarian internationalism. (Stormy applause)

Unity and consistency have become a vital need for all our parties, which helps to achieve our great goal—the construction of a communist society

Our unity and consistency are not just a slogan and a call. The unity and consistency of the Communist and Workers' Parties is a real, constantly strengthening force. Unity and consistency have become a vital need for all our parties. Each Communist and Workers' Party is doing everything possible to further strengthen the unity of the parties standing on the Marxist-Leninist position, because this helps to achieve our great goal—the construction of a communist society. This is how we understand and actually implement the great call of the founders of scientific communism a hundred years ago: "Workers of the world, unite!" (Prolonged applause)

To unite our ranks, strengthen the powerful socialist camp, and stubbornly struggle for world peace, we angrily refute the slander of certain party representatives who, while calling themselves communists, actually pursue policies that are incompatible with communist principles. Their statements are roughly as follows: if there are no disagreements between the brother parties, this means that one party imposes its will on the others, and these parties are in a subordinate position to one party.

If we agree with this view, then this would be to please the imperialists to split the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties, to establish such mutual relations between these parties that each party acts in isolation, disregarding the experience accumulated by each party. All this will lead to contradictory actions of the Communist and Workers' Parties and, ultimately, to disagreements. This is exactly what certain imperialist groups hope for, and they will use any means, including small favors, to find their allies in the socialist countries and find elements to spread ideologies incompatible with Marxism-Leninism.

It goes without saying that such a policy, of course, will please our enemies, because it will bring great, indeed irreparable damage to the communist movement and the workers' movement, and to the entire great cause of building socialism and communism.

But we will not give our enemies any reason to be happy. We are communists, which means we are always loyal internationalists. The Communist Party resolutely condemns any policy that goes against strengthening the friendship between the Communist Parties of all countries and deviates from the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Communists have been and will always be faithful to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, and have been and will always open fire on those who, with their actions, weaken the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, weaken the unity of the constantly developing and strengthening camp of socialist countries.

The difference between communist-Leninists and those so-called "communists" lies in the ability to correctly expose any conspiracy of the enemy aimed at weakening the forces of the communist movement and the workers' movement, aimed at weakening the vanguard of the laboring masses—their Communist and Workers' Parties.

We believe that the fraternal, truly equal relations between the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries will continue to strengthen and develop in the future, to achieve the great goal for which we strive and fight—the construction of the most just society in the world—the communist society. (Prolonged applause)

Comrades, allow me to read the greeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

To the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union warmly congratulates the delegates of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the entire working people of Bulgaria, and wishes them new successes in socialist construction. (Stormy applause)

The Bulgarian Communist Party, by firmly adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and creatively applying these principles in its own conditions, has achieved outstanding successes in the construction of a socialist society. Socialism has achieved decisive victories not only in the cities of Bulgaria but also in the countryside. Your party's rich experience in the socialist transformation of agriculture is a valuable contribution to the theory and practice of socialist construction.

In the struggle to build a new life, the alliance of workers and peasants has been further strengthened, the moral and political unity of the Bulgarian people has been reinforced, and their labor activity has increased. All this proves that the socialist state, as a powerful tool for building a new society, has been further consolidated.

The Bulgarian Communist Party, holding high the banner of the victory of Marxism-Leninism, is waging an uncompromising struggle for the purity of revolutionary theory and against any attempts to modify it.

The Bulgarian communists sacredly defend and develop the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Bulgarian working class, following the teachings of the outstanding activist of the Bulgarian and international communist movement, Georgi Dimitrov, under the leadership of the Central Committee, in the struggle for the great idea of proletarian internationalism, for the unity of the powerful socialist camp and the world communist movement, they have shown high principles and a firm position.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sincerely hopes that the Bulgarian communists and the entire working people of Bulgaria will achieve new victories in socialist construction, in the struggle for the prosperity of their happy, free homeland, and in the struggle to strengthen the unity and friendship of all socialist countries, in the struggle for world peace.

Long live the brotherly People's Republic of Bulgaria and its heroic people—the builders of socialism! (Stormy, prolonged applause. Shouts of "Hurrah!" Everyone stands up)

Long live the tested leader and leader of the Bulgarian people—the Bulgarian Communist Party! (Stormy, prolonged applause. Shouts of "Hurrah!")

Long live the eternal, unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, and the unity and consistency of all socialist countries! (Stormy, prolonged applause. Shouts of "Hurrah!")

Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

(Stormy, prolonged cheers. The participants of the congress stand up and clap rhythmically, shouting: "Eternal friendship!" "Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" "Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" "Communist Party of the Soviet Union!")

### 捍卫马克思列宁主义原则　加强社会主义力量的团结  必须同南共修正主义进行不调和的斗争  赫鲁晓夫在保共代表大会上的讲话

专栏：

    捍卫马克思列宁主义原则　加强社会主义力量的团结
    必须同南共修正主义进行不调和的斗争
    赫鲁晓夫在保共代表大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    请允许我以苏联共产党中央委员会、我们全党的名义、苏联人民的名义向保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会、保加利亚共产党党员和全体保加利亚人民致热烈的兄弟祝贺，并且预祝你们这次代表大会的工作获得成功。（暴风雨般、经久不息的掌声。全体起立）
    我们的党、苏联人民以及所有社会主义国家的人民同你们一起，真诚地为保加利亚共产党在召开第七次党代表大会以前所获得的卓越成就而感到高兴。
    社会主义国家把最发达的资本主义国家抛在后面已为期不远
    保加利亚人民在自己的共产党领导下沿着建设社会主义社会的道路迈进了一大步。苏联劳动人民衷心祝贺保加利亚人民获得的具有历史意义的胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    保加利亚人民共和国经济的迅速发展，人民物质福利的不断改善和文化水平的提高，正如日夫科夫同志在保加利亚共产党中央委员会的总结报告中所明确指出的，再一次令人信服地证明了社会主义对资本主义的优越性。（经久不息的掌声）
    资产阶级的走狗喜欢瞎吹嘘所谓自由经营制度的优越性。听他们的讲法就会觉得：这个制度是人类理想的顶峰，没有什么东西、而且也不可能有什么东西比这个更好的了。但是，他们为什么说不出有哪一个资本主义国家能在这样短的时间内、在发展经济方面取得像走上社会主义道路的那些国家所取得的如此巨大的成就呢？譬如，就拿保加利亚的邻国希腊和土耳其来说吧，统计资料客观地反映了一个事实：走上了社会主义发展道路的人民保加利亚在发展经济和文化方面获得了比它的资本主义邻国大得多的成就。（掌声）
    在社会主义国家，工业产量比战前水平增加了三倍以上，而在资本主义国家，尽管用疯狂的军备竞赛和其他“刺激景气”的方法，它的工业产量增长还不到一倍。
    我们坚决相信，社会主义国家不仅在速度方面、而且在工业产量方面把最发达的资本主义国家抛在后面的时候已经不远了。（掌声）我们这种信念是有事实根据的。苏联不仅在工业总产量方面、而且在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面已经大大地接近最强大的资本主义国家——美国。（掌声）我们在发展科学和技术方面的成就是大家都知道的。苏联现在具有一切必要的条件在最短的历史时期内解决主要的经济任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。（经久不息的掌声）中华人民共和国现在正争取在十五年内在钢及其他重要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国。（鼓掌）捷克斯洛伐克共和国在按人口平均计算的钢产量方面已经赶过了瑞典、法国和西德，而在电力生产方面已经赶过了法国和意大利。（掌声）
    随着社会主义越出一国的范围和世界社会主义阵营的形成，出现了新的意义重大的条件来加速社会主义经济发展的速度。必须合理地、经济地利用这些条件。
    在这方面，我想谈一谈社会主义国家经济合作的某些问题。
    最近在莫斯科举行了经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议。中国共产党、朝鲜劳动党、越南劳动党和蒙古人民革命党的代表也参加了这次会议。会议一致认为，目前社会主义各国的经济联系已经大大地扩大和加强了，在这种情况下，进一步改进社会主义阵营各国经济合作的形式、国民经济各有关部门更进一步实行专业化和协作的问题，就具有十分重要的意义。坚决不渝地实现会议所制定的进一步发展和加强社会主义国家的国际劳动分工的措施，就能保证最合理地利用天然资源和经济资源，提高劳动生产率和进一步提高我们各国人民的福利。合理地组织社会主义阵营各国的经济合作无疑地将会加速各国生产力的发展，加速整个社会主义阵营经济力量的巩固。
    最近的莫斯科会议也像共产党和工人党代表11月会议一样，表明了社会主义各国人民的不可摧毁的团结，表明了它们对今后加强自己的大家庭、发展和改进社会主义阵营各国的合作的深切关心。（经久不息的掌声）
    资产阶级思想家硬说，社会主义阵营的形成和巩固限制了这个阵营里面的各个国家的自主和民族独立。社会主义各国从世界社会主义体系形成以来发展合作的全部实践令人信服地证明了，正是社会主义给人民带来了真正的国家独立。社会主义阵营是平等、自主国家的自愿联盟。在这个联盟里面没有一个国家为自己谋求和争取任何特别的权利、特权或者优势。不言而喻，每一个社会主义国家都独立地决定自己同其他社会主义国家合作的形式问题。在这件事情上没有、而且也不可能有任何强迫。
    然而，假如每一个社会主义国家全都各自单独行动，就像俗话所说的那样，各扫门前雪，那末社会主义国家内部所具有的丰富的潜力是不是能够充分利用来取得社会主义的胜利呢？在目前的国际条件下，假如社会主义国家单独行动，那末是否能保证牢靠地保卫社会主义的成果呢？当然，这是不可能的。
    只有社会主义国家团结一致才能够最大限度地利用世界社会主义体系的优越性，增加这个体系在防止新战争的斗争中以及在同资本主义进行的经济竞赛中的力量。生活现实令人信服地表明了，社会主义阵营各国加强团结不仅不损害其中任何一个国家的民族利益，而且恰恰相反，是它们的民族独立和主权的可靠保证。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    共产党和工人党一致认为，只有社会主义国家的团结，加强它们之间以伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的全面合作和兄弟互助，才能保证社会主义经济的共同高涨，使以前落后的国家赶上先进的水平，才可以消灭过去所遗留下来的它们各国之间在经济和文化发展程度方面事实上的不平等。
    各国共产党和工人党对丰富马克思列宁主义理论作了极大贡献
    社会主义阵营各国的团结首先是由共产党和工人党的团结来保证的，它们这种团结是以不可动摇的、经过历史经验考验的马克思列宁主义原则为基础的。每一个党都创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的共同原则，制定在本国条件下体现这些原则的最合理的具体形式，从而对社会主义建设的理论和实践、对发展马克思列宁主义作出自己的贡献。（掌声）
    我们伟大的导师弗·伊·列宁特别重视群众在为社会主义革命的胜利、为新社会制度的胜利的斗争中创造、发展和改善斗争的具体形式和方法方面的革命创造性。列宁写道：“马克思主义与一切其他社会主义理论不同，它精妙地结合着两种特点，一方面它对于分析客观情势与客观进化形成具有完全科学的清醒见解；另一方面它对于群众……之革命毅力、革命创造力和革命首创性底意义又予以最坚决的承认。”（列宁全集第十三卷第二十一—二十二页。中文版列宁文集第二册二○○一二○一页）
    马克思列宁主义理论的创造性发展是工人阶级一切革命政党的整个国际共产主义运动的事业。（掌声）比方说，大家都知道，中国共产党对社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论和实践作了多么巨大的贡献，它巧妙地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国革命和社会主义建设的具体实践结合起来。欧洲和亚洲各个社会主义国家共产党和工人党对过渡时期的各种问题的创造性解决，其中包括保加利亚共产党对农业进行社会主义改造的经验，对于发展马克思列宁主义的理论，也都具有极大的价值。（掌声）
    保加利亚人民共和国所制订和运用的农业生产合作化的形式，是把农业社会主义改造的普遍规律同保加利亚的具体条件和特点正确结合的一个范例。（掌声）你们党的经验再一次地证明了不论民族特点如何，除了经过生活考验的列宁合作化计划之外，再没有其他方法可以吸引广大农民群众走向社会主义了。（经久不息的掌声）
    兄弟共产党和工人党认为苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议对发展马克思列宁主义有很大的意义。他们指出，这些决议为开辟国际共产主义运动的新阶段奠定了基础，促使这个运动得到进一步的发展。
    资本主义国家的共产党和工人党制定了工人阶级在目前环境下为夺取政权而斗争的方式和方法，丰富了列宁的社会主义革命的理论。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言正确地指出：“为生活经验所检验过的社会主义建设共同规律的创造性运用，各国社会主义建设形式和方法的多样化，是对于马克思列宁主义理论的集体贡献”。这里面每个共产党都有它的一份贡献，各国建设社会主义的经验也都有一份贡献。（掌声）
    宣言的力量和意义在于它总结了苏联和人民民主国家社会主义建设的丰富经验、国际工人运动和共产主义运动的经验、以及世界民族解放运动的经验。在这个具有历史意义的文件中，进一步创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的基本原则，使它适应于我们时代的条件。
    谈到在现代条件下创造性地发展马克思列宁主义理论的时候，不能够对南共纲领草案中所包含的极端错误的论点置若罔闻。这个草案中说，似乎“近几十年来马克思主义思想落后于现代社会的发展了”。又说，因此“在对现代社会问题作进一步的科学的和马克思主义的阐明方面，特别是在阐明从资本主义向社会主义过渡时期的规律和矛盾方面出现了很多空白”。
    近几十年来，苏联共产党和整个国际共产主义运动的确对马克思列宁主义理论作出了许多新的贡献，怎么可以说这些年来马克思列宁主义思想的发展、特别是在研究过渡时期的规律方面落后了呢？
    在这些年里，苏联在人类历史上破天荒第一次建成了社会主义，（暴风雨般的掌声）欧洲和亚洲许多国家在共产党领导下通过革命使工人阶级掌握了政权，无产阶级专政的新形式人民民主制度出现了，并且得到了发展。社会主义已经越出了一国的范围而成为世界体系。
    中国共产党和人民民主国家的兄弟党广泛地实现了资本主义工商业的改造，找到了实现列宁的合作社计划的特殊形式。在所有人民民主国家中，由马克思列宁主义政党领导的祖国阵线和民族阵线这样一类团结劳动人民来为社会主义而奋斗的形式获得了发展。
    南共领导人无视各国共产党和工人党建设社会主义的实践和经验
    所谓马克思列宁主义发展中的“空白”这种说法是违反实际情况的，这难道不明显吗？我们认为，这种说法证明南斯拉夫领导，无视其他国家社会主义建设的实践以及兄弟共产党和工人党的经验。
    南共纲领草案和南斯拉夫领导人在南共第七次代表大会上的发言企图给其他社会主义国家共产党扣上实用主义的帽子。
    看来，南斯拉夫同志认为，社会主义国家的共产党和工人党把自己的主要力量放在拟定和实现保证经济文化发展和提高人民福利的实际措施上面，这就是实用主义。我们认为，这种“实用主义”是符合人民群众的根本利益和社会主义的利益的。劳动群众判断社会主义制度具有优越性，判断社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越，所根据的首先是政权属于谁，生产工具掌握在谁的手里，所根据的是国民经济发展的结果、科学技术的成就，所根据的是社会主义国家劳动人民的文化水平和福利在逐步地增长这一事实。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在我们看来，解决社会主义建设和共产主义建设的理论和实践中的种种问题正是真正创造性地发展马克思列宁主义。
    我们共产党人认为革命理论具有重大的意义，我们之所以取得种种成就，正是因为我们一贯遵循马克思列宁主义的学说。马克思列宁主义理论是我们的指南针，是我们的指路明灯。马克思列宁主义的力量在于它同生活、同社会发展过程的不可分割的联系。（掌声）
    大家知道，劳动人民在对科学共产主义的理论还没有充分了解的时候，就已经倾向于社会主义。劳动者要想摆脱资本主义，要摆脱它的无可救药的苦难和脓疮。他们在寻求摆脱资本主义绝望境地的出路。只有在以科学共产主义理论武装起来的革命政党正确地组织工人、农民和知识分子、并且领导他们为建设新生活而斗争的时候，马克思列宁主义理论才成为最广大的劳动人民群众可以了解的理论。
    马克思主义政党吸引劳动群众投身于革命斗争的实践，指引他们去解决改造社会的具体任务，这就造成了一种条件，使工人和农民不仅可以在道理上了解，而且可以根据自己的经验感受到战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的正确性和生命力。在革命斗争和社会主义建设实践的基础上，理论原则得到了进一步的发展。
    俄国工人阶级同劳动农民结成联盟，在创造性地运用和发展马克思主义理论的共产党的领导下，在1917年10月把政权掌握在自己手里，以便在社会主义的基础上改组经济和全部国家生活。
    还在苏维埃政权的初期，伟大的列宁在制定社会主义建设计划的时候，就提出了一项最重要的任务：发展重工业——繁荣国民经济各部门的基础的基础。在他的领导下制定了我国电气化的具体计划，列宁把这个计划叫做党的第二个纲领。这难道不正好说明列宁是把社会主义建设的理论和实践问题作为不可分割的整体来研究的吗？
    在工人阶级掌握政权以后，社会主义的国家就需要解决许多经济建设和文化建设的问题。马克思列宁主义理论在社会主义建设的过程中得到了实现和进一步的发展。
    苏维埃国家建立四十年来，我们党进行了巨大的工作，动员苏联人民的创造性努力去建设社会主义社会。
    譬如，可以举出苏联共产党近来所解决的一些问题来看一看。党大力改组了工业和建筑业的管理，这项工作产生了巨大的经济效果。试问，这是一个理论问题呢，还是实践问题呢？这是一个具有重大的实践意义和理论意义的问题。
    我们的党在农业方面实行了一系列重大的措施，实现这些措施的结果我们就发挥了巨大的潜力和可能性。苏联农业现在正在大跃进中。1955年初已经制定了发展畜牧业的六年计划。由于实现了党根据马克思列宁主义经营社会主义经济的原则所拟定的措施，由于群众深刻地理解到这些措施的必要性，生产牛奶和奶制品的六年计划提前在三年内完成了。（掌声）
    一年以前，苏联的先进集体农庄和国营农场提出了一项任务：在最近几年内在按人口计算的肉、牛奶和油脂的生产方面赶上和超过美国，这项任务受到了党中央委员会的支持。我们相信这项任务将能够胜利完成。（掌声）
    那么，这是实践问题还是理论问题呢？我们认为，这首先是实践问题。既然社会主义国家的国民经济蒸蒸日上，社会财富年年增加，人们的劳动报酬越来越高，劳动人民的福利日益提高，那么这就意味着，社会主义的阵地在加强，马克思列宁主义理论的原则在实现。大家看到，这些问题是重大的理论问题。（掌声）
    不久以前，在苏联共产党中央委员会的倡议下，通过了关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律。现在，机器直接卖给集体农庄，而机器拖拉机站已经改成技术修理站。集体农庄的春季田间工作表明，这个措施是完全正确的。集体农庄利用拖拉机和其他农业机器并不比机器拖拉机站利用得坏，而是更好。那么，这个问题只是实践问题或只是理论问题吗？不，这个问题既是社会主义建设的理论的问题，也是实践问题。（呼声：“对”，鼓掌）
    在苏共中央五月全会上通过了发展苏联化学工业的宏伟计划。实现这个计划将保证我国国民经济很多部门的技术的进一步发展和有可能更加迅速地解决日用品产量增长的任务。
    乍一看，所有这些问题都是十足的实践问题，但是同时它们也是理论问题。这里是一个整体的两个方面——理论和实践。我们以发展工业、农业、文化方面的成就鲜明地表明了我们理论思想的优越性，表明了作为社会主义社会建设基础的马克思列宁主义理论的力量和生命力。我们在实践中运用这种理论，发展社会主义经济，铺平通向未来的道路，这就是在肯定和发展革命理论，用千千万万人的经验丰富这种理论。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    每一个社会主义建设的实践问题，同时也就是对马克思列宁主义的创造性发展有直接关系的理论问题，把这两者分割开来是不行的。
    没有实践的理论是不结果实的花朵。大家知道，常常有这样一种情况：园子里盛开着花朵，人们看到花朵繁茂的树非常高兴。他们等待秋天到来就会结下累累的果实，酬报人们所付出的劳动。但是开花期过去之后，人们看到花已经雕谢了而却没有形成子房。这就是说，不会结果实。这是多么苦恼的事情，因为人们感觉到自己美好的希望和期待都已成了泡影。当果园里花朵盛开、芬芳扑鼻的时候，人们曾经多么高兴地期待着果实的丰收。然而果园没有带来这种果实。用于经营的劳动付之流水，因为人们所培植的果园没有能偿付他所花费的努力。
    人们对于华而不实的理论家也是感到同样大失所望。（大厅中笑声）人们在听了某些理论空谈家的花言巧语和漂亮的议论之后，有时会十分高兴，开始相信这些人的响亮的辞句。但是他们后来就会明白，在实践中漂亮话完全不管用。（大厅中活跃起来，鼓掌）美丽的辞藻变成了脱离生活的空洞的诺言。一旦人们明白这些“理论家”的华丽辞藻只不过是没有子房的花，只是废话，一点用处也没有，他们就会离开这些“理论家”，离开他们的“理论”。（听众高呼：“对呀”，经久不息的掌声）
    马克思列宁主义的革命理论之所以具有伟大的战无不胜的力量，正是因为它同生活、同社会发展过程有着不可分割的联系，并经过了这种生活的历史考验。（掌声）
    实践如果没有得到先进的革命理论阐明，就必然会陷于暗中摸索的状态。马克思列宁主义的理论向工人阶级、向劳动者指明了解决建设社会主义和共产主义实际任务的道路（掌声）。但是，光有理论而没有实践，也是死的、没有用处的理论。
    列宁嘲笑那些脱离生活而陷入抽象的理论探讨中的人们说：“我们坚持认为，群众性工人运动的实践决不比理论不重要，只有这种实践才能够给予我们的原则以严肃的考验。‘我的朋友，理论是灰色的，而生活之树则是长青的。’”（掌声）（列宁全集第二十卷四九五—四九六页）
    在人类社会的历史上不止一次地提出过似乎是正确的理论原则，然而它们不是从生活本身产生的，没有经过实践的证实。这种理论原则没有给人类带来任何好处，很快地就死亡了。
    马克思列宁主义理论的生命力在于它产生在工人阶级斗争的过程中，并且在同实践的不可分割的联系中得到发展，给人类解答了最迫切的问题。马克思列宁主义理论原则的正确性为争取建成共产主义社会的斗争实践所证实。它为我们党和一切社会主义国家兄弟党的极其丰富的经验所证实。它同样为资本主义国家共产党的经验所证实，这些国家的共产党正根据这种革命理论指导工人阶级和全体劳动人民进行斗争，争取从资本主义的奴役下解放出来，争取建成社会主义社会。
    共产主义不是一个抽象的哲学概念；它含有一定的内容，这就是必须消灭剥削阶级和人剥削人的现象，建立这样一种社会制度，在这种社会制度下所创造的一切物质财富和精神财富都是公共财富，而创造这些财富的人可以按着自己的意愿来支配这些财富，享受自己劳动的全部成果，各尽所能，各取所需。
    共产主义是人类所向往的光辉的未来。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    现代修正主义是一种特洛伊木马计，企图从内部瓦解革命政党
    有些“理论家”企图千方百计地贬低共产党和工人党在建设社会主义方面的实际活动，轻蔑地把这种活动叫做“实用主义”。而他们自己既不愿意从理论角度上、也不愿意从实践角度上来分析这样一个问题：为什么他们得到帝国主义国家的恩施。（全场活跃，喊声“对”，暴风雨般的掌声）
    但是，每一个有觉悟的劳动者都明白，用这种方法是不能提高社会主义经济的。难道这里还谈得上什么社会主义成就，难道这里还谈得上发展马克思列宁主义理论！如果这些可怜的理论家往往还不明白他们所提出的“理论”可能给工人阶级事业带来怎样的害处的话，那么，帝国主义集团却清楚地知道他们希望的是什么，并且正在尽一切努力来支持和鼓励那些能够帮助他们对付共产主义的勾当。
    我不想得罪谁，然而却不能不提出一个使所有地方的正直的共产党人感到激动的问题。为什么帝国主义的头目们在力图从地球上消灭各个社会主义国家和镇压共产主义运动的同时，却资助一个社会主义国家，给它优惠贷款和无偿的恩施。（笑声，掌声）要知道谁都不相信，好像世界上存在着两种社会主义：一种是世界反动派所疯狂仇视的社会主义，而另一种则是帝国主义可以接受的、他们加以援助和支持的社会主义。（笑声，掌声）
    大家都知道，帝国主义者在任何时候，对任何人都不会仅仅为了“漂亮的眼睛”白白地送钱，他们的资本只会投向他们指望获得厚利的事业中。（大厅中活跃，掌声）
    如果帝国主义者同意这样“帮助”社会主义国家，那么他们这样做当然不是为了加强它。决不能设想美国垄断集团会对加强社会主义和发展马克思列宁主义理论感到兴趣。（大厅中发出笑声，掌声）
    这个国家的代表人物硬说我们脱离了马克思列宁主义，而他们是站在正确立场上的。结果就出现了令人奇怪的情况：帝国主义者想通过这个国家“发展”马克思列宁主义。（笑声）这里不妨提一提倍倍尔说的一句很正确的话：如果敌人夸奖你的话，那大概是你做了什么愚蠢的事情。（笑声，经久不息的掌声）
    当帝国主义者联合起来进攻社会主义、进攻工人阶级的时候，某些自命为社会主义战士的人企图削弱工人阶级在反资本主义斗争中的意志，削弱工人阶级的先锋队——共产党和工人党，麻痹它们的警惕性，削弱社会主义国家的团结。
    资产阶级侵略集团倚靠这样的同盟者，就真正可以抱某种希望，可以为他们从内部破坏社会主义国家的企图得以实现而高兴。但是我应当私下地说帝国主义者的这些幻想也注定是不会实现的，他们投在这件“事业”里的资金是白丢了。每当帝国主义者想把赌注放在削弱共产党和工人党的团结上的时候，总得到这样的结果。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。高呼“对呀！”大会代表和来宾起立，有节奏地齐呼“苏联共产党！”“苏联共产党！”“苏联共产党！”）
    各国共产党像爱护眼珠一样爱惜和维护自己队伍的团结一致。它们对修正主义和教条主义进行着不调和的斗争。在这场斗争中，各国共产党当然把主要的火力指向充当帝国主义阵营奸细的修正主义者。很多人都知道特洛伊木马计这个古代故事。当敌人无法用包围和猛攻的办法攻下特洛伊城时，他们就送一匹木马给特洛伊人，在其中潜伏了他们的人，让这些人在晚上去打开城门。
    现代修正主义就是一种特洛伊木马计。（高呼“对”！掌声）修正主义者企图从内部瓦解革命政党，破坏团结，使马克思列宁主义的意识形态涣散和混乱。（高呼“行不通！”掌声）
    同志们！各国共产党和工人党在自己的具有历史意义的宣言中一致对修正主义作了尖锐的评价，说它在现代条件下是国际共产主义运动的主要危险。修正主义是右倾机会主义，是资产阶级意识形态的表现，资产阶级意识形态瘫痪工人阶级的革命精力，要求维持或者恢复资本主义。宣言极其正确地强调指出，“资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源。屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源”。
    一切国家的共产党人都热烈拥护社会主义国家各兄弟党会议所通过的宣言，承认这个宣言是国际共产主义运动最重要的纲领性的文件；对于现代社会发展的基本规律，宣言作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，并极其明确地规定了世界共产主义运动的任务。
    各国党团结一致坚决谴责南共领导人的修正主义观点和恶劣立场
    在所有的共产党和工人党之中，只有一个党——南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟——表示它不同意这个宣言，这样它就把自己同世界上所有的马克思列宁主义政党对立起来。南斯拉夫领导人这一立场在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案中，在南共第七次代表大会的工作中，得到了最鲜明的反映。
    各国共产党和工人党表现出完全团结一致，坚决谴责违反马克思列宁主义的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的修正主义论点以及南斯拉夫领导人的恶劣立场。
    代表同志们，谈到这里，请允许我就苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的关系谈一些看法。我觉得在你们的代表大会上谈谈这些看法是合适的，因为这不仅涉及苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系问题，并且也涉及到各兄弟党同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系问题。
    正如上面指出的，各国兄弟党的一致观点在它们的宣言中得到了反映，它们对现代许多重大问题的一致看法是在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上形成的。
    马克思、恩格斯和列宁一直认为，为科学共产主义的思想原则的纯洁性而斗争具有头等重大的意义，他们对想从工人阶级的战斗理论中抽去革命灵魂的各种各样企图进行了不调和的斗争。他们教导说，科学共产主义的理论是工人阶级在争取本阶级的解放和对社会进行共产主义改造的斗争中的主要思想武器。他们教导说，没有革命理论就不可能有革命运动。
    我们大家都知道，列宁对国际修正主义、对伯恩斯坦和考茨基之流的机会主义进行了多么巨大的斗争，捍卫了革命的创造性的马克思主义。在这个不可调和的思想斗争中，马克思列宁主义的工人阶级政党壮大、巩固起来和受到了锻炼，现在这些政党已经成为国际工人运动强大的组织力量和鼓舞力量。
    忠于我们导师和领袖遗训的共产党和工人党警惕地保护马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性，它们对任何歪曲和离开这些原则的行为都是很敏锐的。马克思列宁主义政党一贯坚决反对这样一些人，他们企图削弱兄弟共产党的团结，破坏各国工人阶级的国际团结，瓦解它们的革命斗争。对革命运动特别危险的是这种人，他们自称为马克思列宁主义者，而实际上（不管他们的本意如何）却在工人运动中扮演阶级敌人的代理人这种角色。因此，共产党和工人党在理论问题上是非常严肃不苟的，对修正马克思列宁主义的任何企图都是不调和的。（掌声）
    我们各国党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系是有着一段历史的。现在应当回忆一下这段历史中的某些重要时刻。
    你们知道，在1948年以前，南斯拉夫和苏联有着良好的关系，这种关系是在第二次世界大战期间反对法西斯侵略者的共同斗争中和在战后最初几年形成的。在1947年9月，当帝国主义反动派开始加紧攻击社会主义国家的时候，苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的共产党，以及欧洲资本主义国家的一些共产党组织了共产党和工人党情报局，初期它的工作机构设在贝尔格莱德。
    回顾过去，我们应当说，在革命的马克思列宁主义运动史中，在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上团结共产党和工人党的力量方面，在争取持久和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中，情报局在一定阶段上起了积极的作用。（经久不息的掌声）
    南斯拉夫共产党，同苏联共产党和其他许多兄弟党一样，是情报局的一个组织者并积极参加了情报局的初期活动。这是1948年以前的情况。以后南斯拉夫共产党和其他兄弟党之间的关系开始恶化了。
    情报局1948年关于南共的决议基本上是正确的
    1948年情报局会议通过了一项“关于南斯拉夫共产党情况”的决议，决议在一系列原则性问题上对南斯拉夫共产党的活动提出了公正的批评。这个决议基本上是正确的，并且是符合革命运动的利益的。以后，在1949到1953年，南斯拉夫共产党和其他兄弟党之间发生了争端，当时在斗争过程中犯了一些错误，出现了一些有害于我们共同事业的芥蒂。
    苏联共产党充分认识到对我们两国和两国人民、对国际共产主义运动的责任，因此表现了主动精神，来消除这一争端，争取使我们两国之间的关系恢复正常，并在马克思列宁主义的基础上建立苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间的接触和合作。
    为此目的，在我们的倡议下，于1955年5、6月间，苏联和南斯拉夫两国代表进行了会谈，并签署了贝尔格莱德宣言。指出以下情况是极其重要的：在贝尔格莱德会谈期间，铁托同志主张不要再翻旧账，而要在新的基础上开始我们的关系。我们很高兴地同意了这一点，并从我们这一方面竭尽一切努力来巩固双方的友好关系。但同时我们也认识到，我们两党之间在一系列重大问题上存在着意识形态上的分歧。我们表现了很大的忍让和耐心，以便在原则性的基础上、在马克思列宁主义的基础上，求得观点的统一。
    然而，生活表明，南斯拉夫领导人过去的包袱背得太重，他们无力摆脱自己的错误立场而牢固地站到马克思列宁主义的立场上来。南斯拉夫领导人即使在关系正常化以后，仍然继续发表反苏言论，并且对社会主义阵营和各兄弟共产党进行攻击。在匈牙利事件期间南斯拉夫领导人以自己的公开言论和行动使社会主义事业蒙受了特别巨大的危害。
    在布达佩斯反革命叛乱期间，南斯拉夫大使馆实质上已经成了那些发动反对匈牙利人民民主制度的斗争的人们的中心，成了纳吉—洛松齐投降叛乱集团的避难所。试回忆一下铁托同志在普拉发表的史无前例的演说，他当时为匈牙利的叛乱分子辩护，而苏联对匈牙利人民的兄弟援助却被称为“苏联的干涉”，他在这次讲话中直接号召其他社会主义国家的某种势力追随所谓“南斯拉夫方针”。
    同志们，至于这是怎么样的方针，我们都很明白。有谁愿意就让他去遵循这种方针吧。然而真正坚持马克思列宁主义立场的政党是不会走这种路线的。（掌声）我们社会主义国家坚决遵照指向共产主义的马克思列宁主义的罗盘前进。（长时间的掌声）
    由于南斯拉夫领导人的这种立场，我们不得不公开批评他们的观点和行动。我们的这种立场得到了一切共产党和工人党的完全支持。可见，并不是坚持马克思列宁主义原则立场的兄弟党、而是南斯拉夫领导人自己那种反对社会主义国家和兄弟党的分裂活动，使南斯拉夫和南共处于同各社会主义国家和国际共产主义运动相隔绝的境地。
    后来根据南斯拉夫领导人的倡议，1957年3月苏联代表团和南斯拉夫代表团在布加勒斯特举行了众所周知的会晤。在这次会谈期间，我们曾经开诚布公地向南斯拉夫领导人说明我们对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在匈牙利问题以及其他问题上的政策的看法。会谈结果在现代国际局势的基本问题上取得了一致，虽然当时承认，我们在意识形态问题上仍有某些分歧。
    在布加勒斯特会晤期间我们曾希望能找到共同的语言和扫清进一步发展友好合作的道路。同时我们也公开地告诉南斯拉夫领导人，如果今后他们仍旧肆意攻击社会主义阵营国家和兄弟党，那末任何一次这样的言论我们都必定要给予回答。我现在以完全负责的态度向我们尊重的、英勇而忠于伟大的马克思列宁主义思想的兄弟保加利亚共产党作这样的表示。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    在布加勒斯特会晤期间曾经议定，南共代表团将参加当时筹备中的社会主义国家兄弟党会议和参加起草这次会议的宣言的工作。
    但是后来的事态表明，南斯拉夫领导人背弃了所同意的立场。南斯拉夫领导人拒绝在社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言上签字之后，决定提出自己的行动纲领——南共纲领草案，这个纲领草案违反对马克思列宁主义政党的一致观点并妄图作为国际共产主义运动和工人运动的纲领性文件。
    当然，南共纲领草案是南斯拉夫共产主义者的内部事务。可是由于这个纲领草案里对其他党和社会主义国家作了别有用心的、侮辱性的评价，并且对马克思列宁主义革命理论的基础做了修正，我们党认为有直接责任对这个文件的反马克思主义原则提出批评。在苏共中央的信件里和我们党的报刊上所阐明的我们党的原则立场得到所有共产党和工人党的一致支持和赞同。
    南斯拉夫领导人拒绝了兄弟党同志式的、原则性的批评，仍然顽固地坚持自己错误的反马克思主义的观点，因而又陷入了孤立。南斯拉夫领导人不去认真分析使南共陷入这种困难局面的原因，反而企图责难兄弟党对他们采取不客观的态度和干涉南共内政。这真像俗话所说的，把自己的病往别人身上推！（全场活跃）
    中国党对南共修正主义的批判是正确的，南共领导人要从各国党的批判中找出差别的企图只是白费力气
    南斯拉夫的某些同志企图从各个共产党和工人党在对他们的错误的估计上找出差别来。他们攻击苏联共产党，他们想把中国共产党强调出来，硬说中国共产党是用一种特殊的方式批评他们的错误。然而，要想从各兄弟党对现代修正主义的批判中找出什么细微差别来，这种企图只是白费力气。在这一点上所有兄弟党都是一致的。我们认为，中国同志和其他各兄弟党一样，对南共纲领草案修正主义原则的批评，都是十分正确十分深刻的，都是在坚持不渝地捍卫着马克思列宁主义的原则。我们完全同意这种原则性的批评。社会主义的力量、各国共产党和工人党的团结一致，只有在同修正主义作斗争中、在维护马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性的斗争中，才能得到加强。（经久不息的掌声）
    最近在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的机关刊“共产主义者”周刊上，发表了一篇纪念贝尔格莱德宣言签署三周年的文章。初看起来会以为这篇文章写得心平气和，目的是想要缓和南共和其他兄弟党之间已经造成的紧张关系。而实际上这篇文章是极端不正确的，它企图为南斯拉夫领导人的错误立场辩解。
    例如，文章中硬说，争取和平的斗争是争取社会主义的斗争的基本内容。对这种说法是不能同意的。
    毫无疑问，为社会主义而斗争的人，是一贯为和平事业而斗争的。但是，为和平事业而斗争的人当中，也有许多人并不拥护社会主义原则。甚至个别保守派人士、宗教信徒、各种各样的资产阶级社会活动家和政治家，也在为和平而斗争。当然，我们在争取和平的斗争中是同他们联合起来的。因此，抱着各种观点和政治信仰的人和组织在争取和平的斗争中，都可以联合在一起，并且现在正联合在一起。
    至于争取社会主义胜利的斗争，那是另一回事。这里不能指望工人阶级和资本家、共产党和资产阶级政党联合起来。争取社会主义胜利的斗争要求站在马克思列宁主义立场上的工人阶级政党观点一致，行动一致，要求坚持不渝地执行无产阶级国际主义原则和建设社会主义的各国人民兄弟互助的原则。（掌声）
    我们一贯的立场是：在争取和平和各国人民安全的斗争中应当竭力加强各国间的合作。我们希望同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国也保持这样的关系。但是，作为共产党人，我们还希望更多一些：我们希望在党的方面取得互相谅解和合作。南斯拉夫共产主义者有着不少革命经验，在反对我们共同的阶级敌人的斗争中也有很大的功绩。南斯拉夫工人阶级和全体劳动人民对第二次世界大战期间同法西斯的斗争作出了颇大的贡献。当然，如果在党的合作方面不成功，那么我们将保持和发展同南斯拉夫在国家方面的正常关系。同时我们坦率地声明，我们是不会同意识形态问题上的歪曲论点调和的，我们将捍卫马克思列宁主义政党的团结，为纯洁革命理论而斗争。
    同志们！我现在回忆起1956年我同南共领导人的一次谈话，当时我们交换了意见，进行了友好的交谈。在谈到我们的分歧时，我那时请铁托同志注意必须更深入地分析事件和我们的相互关系，正确地评价已经形成的局势，以便在原则性的基础上更迅速地取得观点的一致。当时我想起一个大家都知道的比喻：“全连步伐一致，而有一个士兵步伐不一致”，试问，谁应当调整步子：是全连随着这个士兵调整步伐呢，还是这个士兵随着全连调整步伐呢？（全场活跃）出席这次座谈的科查·波波维奇曾经提了一个问题：
    谁是连队，谁是士兵？
    我对这个反问的回答是：
    请您自己想想，谁是连队，谁是士兵。
    我说，在任何情况下，每个士兵都知道，连队就是连队，而一个士兵只是这个连队的一个成员，因此不应当是连队随着士兵调整步伐，而是应当相反。（会场活跃。掌声）如果你们是站在另一个立场，那末你们就直说你们不是这个以马克思列宁主义为指南的步伐一致的共产主义连队的一名士兵。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们将永远神圣地维护我们伟大的马克思列宁主义国际共产主义大军的团结。苏联、中国、保加利亚和其他社会主义国家的兄弟共产党、全世界的共产党，是团结一致的，它们坚决反对现代修正主义。各国共产党人高举着所向无敌的马克思列宁主义旗帜，并且在这面光辉的旗帜下满怀信心地走向自己的崇高目标。（经久不息的掌声）
    保共对社会主义事业的忠诚得到各国党的深深尊敬，苏保两党的关系向来是真正兄弟的关系
    同志们！保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会将对保加利亚社会主义建设的重要时期作出总结并规定保加利亚今后向社会主义前进的道路。无疑，你们提出来的新任务将由紧密地团结在战斗的共产党周围的保加利亚人民胜利地加以解决。
    保加利亚工人阶级和保加利亚全体人民有权利以自己的共产党而感到自豪。（暴风雨般的掌声）数十年来这个党在同帝国主义反动派、同法西斯主义势力的残酷战斗中经历了锻炼，它发动了工人阶级和劳动农民去为争取自由的、社会主义的保加利亚而斗争。你们党有许多优秀的儿子为伟大的工人阶级事业献出了自己的生命。
    你们的党是季米特尔·布拉戈耶夫和格奥尔基·季米特洛夫以对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚和对任何背弃它的东西绝不妥协的精神培育起来的。这种优秀的品格在保加利亚共产党人建设社会主义和争取所有社会主义国家、共产党和工人党的牢不可破的友谊和团结的坚定斗争中以新的力量表现出来。保加利亚共产党以自己列宁主义的国际主义政策和对我们共同事业的忠诚博得了国际共产主义运动和所有兄弟党的深深尊敬。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们苏联共产党，作为一个同保加利亚共产党一直保持着紧密联系的兄弟党，高兴地指出，保加利亚共产党在保加利亚人民共和国社会主义建设问题上以及在国际共产主义运动和工人运动问题上的正确路线和政策，都证明了保共领导的马克思列宁主义的成熟，证明它的中央委员会善于创造性地探讨并且在实践中运用马克思列宁主义原则。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们坚信，保加利亚共产党将更加紧密地把自己的队伍团结在这个经过考验的领导周围，在保加利亚人民共和国的社会主义建设中取得新的更大的胜利，并且将永远走在国际共产主义运动的最前列。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    苏联共产党和保加利亚共产党之间的关系向来是最好的、真正兄弟的关系。早在保加利亚人民的伟大儿子格奥尔基·季米特洛夫领导保加利亚共产党的时候，我们之间的关系就是如此，在他死后，以保共中央政治局为首的季米特洛夫的忠实继承者、忠实的马克思列宁主义者领导保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国的时候，这种关系仍然如此。（暴风雨般的长时间的掌声）
    让我代表苏联共产党中央委员会为我们两党以及两国之间在所有问题上永远有着充分了解和兄弟联盟而表示高兴。不论我们互相讨论什么问题，我们总是看到，兄弟的保加利亚共产党代表对待这些问题总是同苏联共产党的立场一致，即同马克思列宁主义的立场一致。（暴风雨般的长时期的掌声，赞同的欢呼声，全体起立）
    对我们共同任务的这种理解是建筑在始终不渝地实现马克思列宁主义原则的基础上，这是我们所遵循的原则，是以中央政治局和第一书记日夫科夫同志为首的保加利亚共产党中央委员会所一贯执行的原则。（暴风雨般的掌声）我们同保加利亚人民共和国的国家关系也异常融洽地发展。我们两国之间、正像两党之间一样，不仅没有过任何分歧，而且就连分歧的影子也没有。以于哥夫同志为首的保加利亚人民共和国政府本着本国人民和自己国家的切身利益、全世界和平的利益，在国内发展的所有问题上和国际关系方面始终不渝地执行着这一路线。（掌声）
    我们同保加利亚同志从来没有不同的观点：我们的观点和估计一向是一致的。这是可以理解的，因为领导我们两个国家的是这样的党，它们坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的立场上，站在巩固各国共产党和工人党之间、各个社会主义国家之间的兄弟关系的立场上，站在无产阶级国际主义立场上。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    团结和一致成了我们各个党的切身需要，这有助于达到我们的伟大目标——建成共产主义社会
    我们的团结和一致，不单是口号和号召。共产党和工人党的团结和一致是一种现实存在的、不断加强的力量。团结和一致成了我们各个党的切身需要。每一个共产党和工人党都在尽一切力量来进一步巩固站在马克思列宁主义立场上的党的团结，因为这有助于达到我们的伟大目标——建成共产主义社会。我们就是这样来理解和实际贯彻一百多年前科学共产主义创始人所提出的伟大号召：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”（经久不息的掌声）
    为了团结我们的队伍，加强强大的社会主义阵营，为世界和平而顽强地斗争，我们愤怒地驳斥某个党的代表人物所擅长的诬蔑，他们自命为共产主义者，而实际上却实行着同共产主义原则格格不入的政策，这些人物的论断大意是这样：如果兄弟共产党之间没有分歧，这就意味着某一个党把自己的意志强加于其他党，而这些党处在从属于一个党的地位。
    如果同意这种观点，那么这就等于讨好帝国主义者来分裂共产党和工人党的团结，在这些党之间建立这样的相互关系：每个党孤立地单独行动，无视每个党所积累的经验。这一切会使共产党和工人党产生互相矛盾的行动，最终产生分歧。某些帝国主义集团所希望的正是如此，它们不惜采取一切手段，利用各种小恩小惠在社会主义国家中寻找它们的同盟者，寻找替它们传播同马克思列宁主义格格不入的意识形态的分子。
    用不着说，这种政策当然会使我们的敌人感到高兴，因为这种政策会给共产主义运动和工人运动以及建设社会主义和共产主义的整个伟大事业带来巨大的、确实无法挽回的损失。
    但是我们决不会使我们的敌人有高兴的理由。我们是共产党人，这就是说我们始终是忠诚的国际主义者。共产党坚决谴责任何与加强各国共产党之间的友谊背道而驰的、脱离马克思列宁主义原则的政策。
    共产党人在过去和将来都始终忠于马克思列宁主义的学说，在过去和将来都始终要向那些用自己的行动削弱各国共产党和工人党的团结的力量、削弱不断发展和加强的社会主义国家阵营的团结的人开火。（鼓掌）
    共产主义者—列宁主义者同那些所谓的“共产主义者”不同的地方，在于善于正确地识破敌人的旨在削弱共产主义运动和工人运动的力量、旨在削弱劳动人民群众的先锋队——他们的共产党和工人党——的任何阴谋。
    我们相信，各国共产党和工人党之间的兄弟般的、真正平等的关系今后将继续加强和发展，以达到我们为之努力、为之奋斗的伟大目标——建成世界上最正义的社会——共产主义社会。（经久不息的掌声）
    同志们，让我宣读苏联共产党中央委员会给保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的贺词。
    致保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会
    苏联共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的代表、保加利亚共产党党员和保加利亚全体劳动人民，并且祝他们在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    保加利亚共产党由于坚定地遵循着马克思列宁主义原则并且把这一原则在本国条件下创造性地加以运用，因而在社会主义社会的建设中取得了卓越的成就。社会主义不仅在保加利亚的城市取得了决定性胜利，而且在农村也取得了决定性胜利。你们党在农业社会主义改造事业中的丰富经验是对社会主义建设的理论和实践的宝贵贡献。
    在建设新生活的斗争中工农联盟更加巩固了，保加利亚人民道义上、政治上的团结加强了，他们的劳动积极性提高了。这一切证明，作为建设新社会的有力工具的社会主义国家进一步巩固了。
    保加利亚共产党高举着马克思列宁主义的胜利旗帜，为革命理论的纯洁、为反对修改它的任何企图进行着不调和的斗争。
    保加利亚共产党人神圣地卫护和发扬保加利亚工人阶级的光荣革命传统，遵循着保加利亚和国际共产主义运动的卓越活动家格奥尔基·季米特洛夫的遗训，在中央委员会的领导下，在为无产阶级国际主义的伟大思想、为强大的社会主义阵营和世界共产主义运动的团结的斗争中，表现出高度的原则性和坚定的立场。
    苏联共产党中央委员会衷心地希望保加利亚共产党人和保加利亚全体劳动人民在社会主义建设中，在争取他们幸福、自由的祖国的繁荣以及加强一切社会主义国家的团结和友好的斗争中，在争取世界和平的斗争中，取得新的胜利。
    祝兄弟的保加利亚人民共和国和它英雄的人民——社会主义建设者繁荣昌盛！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。高呼“乌拉！”全体起立）
    保加利亚人民久经考验的领导者和领袖——保加利亚共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。高呼“乌拉！”）
    祝苏联人民和保加利亚人民的永世的牢不可破的友谊、所有社会主义国家的团结一致日益巩固，不断发展！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。高呼“乌拉！”）
                    苏联共产党中央委员会
    （暴风雨般的、经久不息的欢呼。参加大会的人站着一顿一拍地齐呼：“永恒的友谊！”“苏联共产党！”“苏联共产党！”“苏联共产党！”）
