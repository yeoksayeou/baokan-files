It was not easy to get a chance to go to the city, so I took the opportunity to visit my headmaster, whom I hadn't seen for six years. I heard that he had been transferred to a factory as the Party Secretary. In order to let the headmaster know that his student had gone to university, I had to be particular about my attire. For this reason, I ironed my clothes to a sharp crease, polished my leather shoes until they shone, and combed my hair until it was slick.

It took a lot of effort to find the headmaster's residence. As soon as I entered, I hesitated a little. How could it be a workers' compound? Although everyone is now eliminating the "Four Pests" and paying attention to hygiene, the courtyard was cleaned very well. However, there were some ropes stretched haphazardly, and children's soiled diapers were drying, making it almost impossible to walk. The closest to me was a nanny-like woman standing in front of the stove cooking, and a two- or three-year-old child was standing next to her, looking at her with his head tilted. I asked, and the woman sized me up and down and said, "This is it. Please sit inside, and I'll call him." Saying that, she put the lid on the pot and took the child away.

The room was simple and clean, with only a large bed with a stack of neatly folded, but faded, quilts on it. Under the window was a square table with a teapot, teacups, and books on it. A half-new bicycle was placed against the back wall. The more I looked, the more suspicious I became. I thought: I must have found the wrong person and come to a worker's dormitory...

Just as I was thinking wildly, a familiar voice came from the courtyard. Ha, isn't that the headmaster! I was about to greet him when the headmaster had already stretched out his two black hands to my face: "Ah, sit down, sit down quickly." The sweat on his face dripped down, and he couldn't wipe it dry. He was wearing a homespun coarse cloth shirt with a purple wool vest over it. The cuffs of his shirt were already frayed all around. He was wearing patched pants and cloth shoes splattered with mud. He looked like a genuine peasant who had just returned from irrigating the fields.

"Headmaster, what have you been doing, like this..."

Before I could finish, he smiled as he always did and said, "I took advantage of the break today to make some coal cakes for the family, look." He spread his hands out and stretched them out in front of me. His hands were covered with coal dust, and his palms and fingers were covered with blisters, some of which had dried up.

At this time, the "nanny" brought in two bowls of tea. The child tugged at her clothes, not leaving her side, and shyly peeked at me.

"Mao Mao, come to Daddy, tell Mommy to cook."

"Ah!" I almost cried out. How could she be the headmaster, no, the Party Secretary's wife? She's a doctor, at least she could wear a better pair of pants. I don't even earn money yet… I lowered my head and looked at my pants and leather shoes, and I felt a burst of dizziness, as if I was about to fall down.

I looked at our headmaster. His already stalwart body seemed even more stalwart, but the top of his head, which was already a little bald, was even balder, his cheekbones were higher, his eye sockets were deeper, and his wrinkles had increased.

"You've lost weight compared to before. Your work must be more demanding now, right?"

"Lost weight?" He touched his face and said with a smile, "It's more demanding than school work. Every day I go to the factory at five o'clock and come back at nine o'clock in the evening, without any time to rest in between. For example, when the workers are resting in the morning, it's exactly the time for us to receive the masses. Especially recently, workers are willing to come to the Party Committee to solve problems." He paused slightly and asked me, "Are you busy now?"

"Very busy, especially recently, with the Double-Anti Campaign and the sweeping away of the 'Five Bad Airs.' Now is the time to pour out our hearts to the Party."

He suddenly changed the subject: "Is your family's life better than it was then? You were actually able to go to university. Do you remember? At that time, you were always making a fuss about dropping out of school, saying that your family was poor and there was no way." He said, laughing.

"How could I not remember? Now that we've all joined the commune, the situation is much better, but it's still not easy to support me in school."

"Yes, it's still relatively difficult for your father to support you in school with his labor alone, but if you save a little more yourself, it'll be fine. I used to tell you often that those old revolutionaries in Yan'an relied on themselves for everything, and a cotton-padded coat would last them five years. You are all now 'blessed and don't know it.'"

My face flushed, and I felt a pang of heartache. I made an excuse that I had something to do and said goodbye to the headmaster.

He took me to the door, held my hand, and instructed, "Come again, I have a rest every Friday." I agreed and left, feeling as refreshed as if I had just taken a shower after turning the corner.

    不是找错了人
    星桥
    好容易得到一个进城的机会，顺便去探望探望六年不见的校长，听说他现在调到一个工厂里当党委书记了。为了使校长知道他的学生已经上了大学，所以在穿戴上还需考究考究，为此我把衣服熨的见棱见角，皮鞋擦的亮堂堂，头发梳的光溜溜。
    费了很大周折，才找到校长的住处。一进门，我又有些犹豫，怎么是个工人大杂院？虽然现在都是除四害讲卫生，院子打扫的很干净。但是横七竖八拉着一些绳子，晒着小孩的屎布尿褥，简直叫你走不过去。离我最近的有个保姆样的人站在锅台前作饭，一个两三岁的小孩歪着脖子站在旁边看着。我一问，那女人上下打量了我一下说：“就是这儿，你到屋里坐，我去叫一下。”说着盖起锅盖拉着小孩走了。
    屋子里简单而干净，只有一张大床，床上放一摞叠得整齐的但褪了色的被子。窗根下一张方桌上面摆着茶壶、茶碗和书籍。靠后边的墙根放辆半新旧的自行车。我越看越觉得怀疑，我想：一定找错了人，走到一位工人的宿舍来了……
    正在胡思乱想，从院里传来一阵熟悉的声音。哈，可不是校长是谁！我正要迎出去，校长已将两只黑手伸到我脸前：“啊，快坐，快坐。”他脸上的汗珠直往下淌，擦也擦不干，一件家做粗布衬衣，套一件紫色毛背心，衬衣的袖口已经破了一圈。一条补钉裤子，布鞋上溅满了泥斑，简直像一个地地道道的庄稼汉才从田里浇地回来。
    “校长，你作什么啦，这样……”
    他还没等我说完，就和以前一样地微笑说：“趁今天休息给家打些煤糕，看。”他把两手摊开，伸到我眼前。他手上粘满了煤黑，掌上指头上布着几个血泡，有的已干了。
    这时候，那“保姆”送进两碗茶来，小孩拉着她的衣襟左右不离，怯生生地偷偷看着我。
    “毛毛，到爸爸跟前来，叫妈妈作饭。”
    “啊！”我差点叫出声来。怎么她就是校长、不，党委书记的爱人，她是个医生，起码还不穿条料子裤，我不挣钱都还……我低下头看着我的裤子，皮鞋，不禁感到一阵头重脚轻，似乎马上就要栽倒似的。
    我看着我们的校长，他那本来就很魁伟的身体显得更魁伟了，只是原来就有些秃顶的头上更秃了，颧骨高了，眼窝深了，皱纹增多了。
    “您比以前瘦了，现在工作可能繁重些吧？”
    “瘦了吗？”他摸着脸笑着说：“比学校工作繁重些，每天都是五点钟就去厂子，晚上九点回来，中间没休息的工夫，像上午工人休息的时候，恰好正是我们接见群众的时间。尤其最近，工人一有事都愿找到党委会来解决。”他稍顿了一下又问我：“你们现在忙么？”
    “很忙，尤其最近，双反、扫五气，现在正是向党交心。”
    他忽然扭转话头：“家里生活比那时强了吧？你竟能上到大学，还记得吗？那时你整天是闹退学，说家庭困难、没办法。”他说着笑起来了。
    “怎么不记得？现在都入了社，情况好多了，不过供我上学还是不富裕。”
    “是呀，凭你父亲一个人劳动供你上学目前还是比较困难，不过自己再节约点，就可以。我过去不是常对你们说，在延安时那些老革命，什么不是依靠自己，一身棉衣穿五年，你们现在都是‘身在福中不知福’。”
    我脸上刷地一下只觉得热烘烘的，心眼里感到一阵钻心的难受。我就推托有事向校长告辞。
    他把我送到门外握住我的手嘱咐道：“来吧，我每星期五都是休息。”我答应着走了，拐过弯像是刚洗过澡一样浑身感到轻松。
