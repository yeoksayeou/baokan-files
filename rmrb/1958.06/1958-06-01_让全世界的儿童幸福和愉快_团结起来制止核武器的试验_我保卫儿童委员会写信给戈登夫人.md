Xinhua News Agency, 31st. The Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children wrote to Madame Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on the 26th, to congratulate her on International Children's Day on June 1st.

The congratulatory letter stated: "On the occasion of the 'June 1st' International Children's Day, and the upcoming Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children extends warm congratulations to all the delegates and friends present who are working for peace and for the lasting happiness of children!" "Since its establishment, the Women's International Democratic Federation has made brilliant contributions to defending world peace, striving for women's rights, and ensuring children's happiness. It not only centrally expresses the will of parents around the world to protect children, but also plays an active role in uniting women from all walks of life and promoting friendly cooperation between them."

The congratulatory letter said: "From our own experience in recent years, we have deeply realized the infinite benefits that peace brings to children. Due to the stability and continuous improvement of our people's lives, children's rights to survival, health, and education have been fundamentally guaranteed. In particular, the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production in the past six months has driven a leap forward in China's children's welfare work. Now, many places in China have universalized primary school education this year, and a health care and prevention network has begun to take shape throughout the country. For the first time in history, our children are riding in cars, trains, ships, and trolley buses made in their own country; for the first time, they have seen various types of domestically produced tractors and domestically produced jet aircraft. Many new factories and new residences have been built and are being built throughout the country; men, women, old and young are all greening their hometowns. All of this encourages children to study harder, love labor, love science, and develop the virtues of honesty, courage, and unity and friendship. They have lofty ideals and will be able to boldly create all kinds of deeds that their predecessors could not have imagined. Therefore, this year's activities for Chinese children to celebrate 'June 1st' International Children's Day are more lively and colorful than in previous years."

The congratulatory letter continued: "We hope that all children in the world can be spared from the disasters of war and can grow up healthy in a peaceful and joyful environment. We firmly believe that this conference will represent the wishes of all life-giving mothers and assume the sacred duty of protecting life. Let us use the invincible power of unity to stop nuclear weapons testing and ban nuclear weapons!"

The congratulatory letter concluded: "May the children of the whole world grow up happily in an environment of peaceful construction! We wish the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation a complete success!"

    我保卫儿童委员会写信给戈登夫人
    新华社31日讯　中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会于26日写信给国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人，祝贺“六一”国际儿童节。
    贺信写道：“值此‘六一’国际儿童节，即将召开国际民主妇联第四届代表大会之际，中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会谨向所有到会的为和平、为儿童的永久幸福而努力的代表们，朋友们，致以热烈的祝贺！”“国际民主妇联自从成立到现在，为保卫世界和平、争取妇女权利、保障儿童幸福，作出了光辉的贡献。它不但集中地表达了全世界的父母们保卫儿童的意志，而且对于团结各阶层妇女，促进她们之间的友好合作起了积极的作用。”
    贺信说：“这几年来从我们亲身经历中深深地体会到和平给儿童带来无穷无尽的好处。由于我国人民生活的稳定和不断改善，儿童的生存、健康和受教育的权利得到了根本的保证，特别是近半年来我国工农业生产大跃进，带动了我国儿童福利工作的跃进。现在我国已经有许多地方在今年内普及了小学教育，全国已经开始形成一个卫生医疗预防网。我们的孩子有史以来第一次乘坐自己国家制造的汽车、火车、轮船和无轨电车；第一次看见国产的各种类型的拖拉机和国产的喷气式飞机。全国各地已经建筑和正在建筑许多新的工厂和新的住宅；各地男女老幼都在绿化自己的家乡。这一切都鼓舞着孩子们更加努力学习，热爱劳动，热爱科学，养成诚实勇敢，团结友爱的美德。他们具有远大的理想，将能大胆地创造出前人所想像不到的各种事迹。因此，今年我国儿童庆祝‘六一’国际儿童节的活动比往年更加生动活泼，丰富多采。”
    贺信接着写道：“我们希望世界上所有的儿童都能免遭战争的灾难，能够在和平愉快的环境中健康地成长。我们坚信，这次大会将代表所有孕育生命的母亲的心愿，负起保护生命的天职。让我们用团结的不可战胜的力量来停止核武器的试验，禁止核武器吧！”
    贺信最后说：“让全世界的儿童都能在和平建设的环境中幸福地成长！预祝国际民主妇联第四届代表大会胜利成功！”
