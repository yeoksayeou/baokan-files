    Participated in the Making of the Atomic Bomb and Felt Guilty
    American Mathematician Flanders Commits Suicide
    Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, 28th: Donald Flanders, an American mathematician who once worked on calculations for the invention of the atomic bomb, committed suicide with sleeping pills on the 27th. In his suicide note, he said, "I am worth more dead than alive. I regret what I did in the past, but I had to do it then." He also wrote that he simply couldn't bear the thought of returning to the institute.
    Flanders was fifty-seven years old. Before his death, he was the director of the Applied Mathematics Department of the National Argonne Laboratory, which is under the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and was responsible for using electronic computers to perform mathematical calculations for atomic bomb research. From 1943 to 1946, he served as the head of the calculation department in the theoretical physics department of the Los Alamos Atomic Laboratory.

    参加制造原子弹于心有愧
    美数学家弗兰德斯自杀
    据新华社28日讯　芝加哥消息：曾经为发明原子弹从事计算工作的美国数学家唐纳德·弗兰德斯于27日服安眠药自杀。他在遗书中说：“我死了比活着要值钱一些。我对过去所做的事感到遗憾，但我那时又不得不那么做。”他还写道，一想起回到研究所，我简直就不能忍受。
    弗兰德斯今年五十七岁。死前，他担任美国原子能委员会所属的国立阿贡尼研究所应用数学部主任，负责用电子计算机为研究原子弹进行数学运算。1943年至1946年，他一直担任洛萨拉摩斯原子研究所理论物理部计算处的负责人。
