Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 21st. The Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CCP) successfully concluded here this afternoon.

The Congress elected a Central Committee composed of ninety-seven members and fifty alternate members, and a Central Auditing Commission composed of twenty-five members. The list of candidates proposed by the Party Central Committee was unanimously approved.

Subsequently, Comrade Duransky gave a report on behalf of the Proposals Examination Committee. He suggested that the Congress adopt the "Draft Resolution on the Work Report of the Central Committee," the "Draft Resolution on the Work Report of the Central Auditing Commission," the "Draft Resolution of the Eleventh Congress of the CCP," and the "Draft Resolution on Certain Amendments to the Party Constitution."

In his report, Duransky said that the progress of the Congress showed that the entire Party was in complete agreement on the understanding of our past work and future tasks. He emphasized that the Central Committee had thoroughly implemented the general line of socialist construction during the period between the two congresses, established a solid foundation for socialism, and virtually eliminated the phenomenon of human exploitation. He said that based on this premise, the Party Central Committee put forward the goal of completing the construction of socialism in a short period of time as the direct goal and main task of the entire Party. The Proposals Examination Committee requested the Congress to approve all the activities of the Central Committee during the period between the two congresses and to adopt the work report of the Central Committee.

After Duransky's report, the Congress unanimously adopted the above four resolutions. At this moment, enthusiastic applause rang out once again throughout the hall. Cheers of "Long Live the Czechoslovak Communist Party!" and "Long Live Peace!" lasted for a long time.

Comrade Novotny then delivered a closing speech to the Congress. He pointed out that the Congress expressed the fighting spirit, ideological unity, and firm will to complete socialist construction of the entire Party, and expressed the entire Party's loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and internationalism. The Congress laid the general line for completing socialist construction.

Novotny then thanked the fifty-nine communist and workers' parties that sent delegations to the Congress and sent telegrams to the Congress on behalf of the Congress. He especially thanked the support of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said: "Although we speak different languages, we have a common language, which is the language of Marxism-Leninism." He also emphasized that the CCP is a firm link in the international revolutionary movement, and it will faithfully guide its activities with the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and it will resolutely and thoroughly oppose revisionism.

Finally, Novotny called on the entire Party to strengthen ideological unity, closely connect with the masses, and strengthen political and organizational work to complete socialist construction.

Comrade Novotny's speech was welcomed by a storm of sustained applause. Attendees constantly shouted: "Long Live the Czechoslovak Communist Party!" "Long Live the Soviet Union!" "Long Live the World Revolutionary Movement!" "Long Live Peace!"

The delegates also passed a letter of greetings from the Eleventh Congress of the CCP to the Central Committee of the CPSU with excitement.

The Congress finally declared its closing amidst the soaring strains of the "Internationale."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 21st. At the morning session of the fourth day (21st) of the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the report of the Party Central Committee continued to be discussed.

First to speak at the meeting was Firinger, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. He summarized the current international situation and analyzed the profound economic crisis of the capitalist system and the causes of world tensions. He pointed out that at a time when capitalism is in decline and collapse, the Yugoslavs and other right-wing elements in the workers' movement are undermining the unity of the socialist camp, blurring the essential differences between the two camps, advocating the theory of ultra-imperialism, and acting as assistants to imperialism. He said that the Czechoslovak Communist Party will fight against the destructive activities of modern revisionists in the future. He also emphasized the need to strengthen the unity and struggle of the forces defending peace in his speech.

Vitshkel, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Youth League, spoke at the meeting about how to improve the work of the Youth League in accordance with the spirit of the report of the Party Central Committee. He called for further strengthening the political and ideological concern and supervision of the youth by Party organizations and Party members.

Next, representatives of fraternal parties attending the Congress delivered congratulatory speeches. They were the representatives of the Communist Party of Venezuela, the Communist Party of the Netherlands, the Communist Party of Luxembourg, the Communist Party of Israel, the Icelandic United Socialist Party, the Swiss Labor Party, the Communist Party of Australia, the Jordanian Communist Party, the Bolivian Communist Party, the Paraguayan Communist Party, the Iranian People's Party, the Ceylon Communist Party, the Ecuadorian Communist Party, and the Sudanese Communist Party.

The representative of the Jordanian Communist Party condemned the revisionist activities of the Yugoslav communists. He pointed out that the right-wing socialists in his country cited the words of the Yugoslav revisionists to undermine the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and to cast doubt on the significance of the connection between the Arab national liberation movement and the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

The representative of the Sudanese Communist Party, Mahmoud, said that the Yugoslav revisionists had done a great favor to imperialism and the reactionaries in Sudan. The Sudanese reactionaries asked, since communist Yugoslavia accepts American aid, why do you communists oppose American aid? The representative emphasized that this is how the Yugoslav revisionists help imperialism undermine the people's struggle.

The representative of the Iranian People's Party said that the Central Committee of the People's Party condemned the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia last month, and passed a resolution calling for a struggle against tendencies of liquidationism and revisionism.

The representative of the Israeli Communist Party, Mei Wilner, criticized the Yugoslav program, pointing out that revisionism not only endangers socialism, but also endangers peace.

The representative of the Swiss Labor Party highly praised the resolute attitude adopted by the Czechoslovak Communist Party in the struggle against all forms of revisionism.

The representative of the Communist Party of Venezuela criticized the tendency to revise Marxism-Leninism and "national communism," considering it a form of revisionism.

The representative of the Communist Party of Luxembourg expressed support for the Moscow Declaration and refuted the serious errors of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The representatives of the Communist Parties of the Netherlands and Australia also resolutely criticized revisionist tendencies.

    杜兰斯基在报告中说，代表大会的进程表明全党对我们过去工作和未来任务的认识完全一致。他强调中央委员会在两次代表大会期间彻底贯彻执行了建设社会主义的总路线，建立了社会主义的巩固基础，实际上消除了人剥削人的现象。他说，根据这一前提，党中央提出了在短期内把建成社会主义作为全党的直接目标和主要任务。提案审查委员会要求大会批准中央委员会在两次代表大会期间的一切活动，并且通过中央委员会的工作报告。
    在杜兰斯基报告以后，大会一致通过了上述四项决议。这时全场又一次响起了热烈的掌声。“捷共万岁！”“和平万岁！”的欢呼声经久不息。

    据新华社布拉格21日电  捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会第四天（21日）上午会议，继续讨论党中央委员会的报告。
    捷共中央政治局委员费林格第一个在会上发言。他综述了当前的国际形势，分析了资本主义体系的深刻经济危机和造成世界紧张局势的原因。他指出，在资本主义正处在没落和崩溃的时候，南共和其他工人运动中的右派却破坏社会主义阵营团结，混淆两个阵营的本质区别，提倡超帝国主义的理论，充当了帝国主义的助手。他说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党今后将为反对现代修正主义者的破坏活动而斗争。他在发言中还强调加强保卫和平力量的团结和斗争。

    约旦共产党代表谴责了南斯拉夫共产主义者的修正主义活动。他指出，他的国家里的右翼社会党人引用了南斯拉夫修正主义者的话来破坏工人阶级和共产党的领导作用，并且使人对阿拉伯民族解放运动和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营之间的联系的意义发生怀疑。
    苏丹共产党代表马哈茂德说，南斯拉夫修正主义者给帝国主义和苏丹国内的反动派帮了大忙。苏丹反动派问道，既然共产主义南斯拉夫接受了美援，你们这些共产党人为什么反对美援呢？这位代表强调说，南斯拉夫修正主义者就是这样来帮助帝国主义破坏人民斗争的。
