Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Northern Fifteen Provinces, Cities, and Autonomous Regions Local Transportation Work Symposium, which closed in Beijing on the 9th, based on the spirit of the General Line, determined the transportation construction policy of relying on the localities, relying on the masses, focusing on popularization, and combining popularization with improvement, striving to build a comprehensive transportation network in China in the shortest possible time.

The meeting considered that the transportation departments' work had achieved great success in the past, and the highway and waterway transportation industries basically adapted to the needs of socialist construction and production, and gained experience.

In reviewing the past work, the meeting pointed out that there were two different transportation construction policies and guiding ideologies in the transportation industry. One is the "local, mass, and popularization" policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, relying on the localities, relying on the masses, focusing on popularization, and combining popularization with improvement. The other is the "direct, specialized, and high" policy of blindly pursuing high standards and modernization by unilaterally emphasizing vertical leadership and professional systems.

The meeting used facts to prove that the "local, mass, and popularization" policy is the policy for the transportation sector to implement the General Line of Socialist Construction. In 1956, by relying on the masses, more than 80,000 kilometers of simple roads were built across the country in just one year. At present, the broad masses have extremely high enthusiasm for transportation construction in the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. In some places, because they adhered to the policy of relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses to build roads themselves, the transportation industry has developed rapidly. Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, recently mobilized the masses of the county to work hard for ten days and completed the county's local road network of more than 600 kilometers, so that automobiles could reach every township. The people of Ji County, Hebei Province, built the county's highway network with their own strength, achieving "every township has a highway and every commune has a large vehicle." These facts all prove that running the transportation industry according to the "local, mass, and popularization" line can give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of local party committees, governments, and the broad masses in developing the transportation industry, and the result will be more, faster, better, and more economical.

At the same time, the meeting criticized the one-sided guiding ideology of "direct, specialized, and high." It believes that following the "direct, specialized, and high" line to run transportation will inevitably form a monopoly, tie the hands and feet of the masses, and can only build a few point-line projects, but cannot build transportation in a wide area, and the result will inevitably be less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Due to the guidance of the "direct, specialized, and high" ideology, the Ministry of Communications in the past devoted most of its energy to directly affiliated, modernized, and centralized, but only small-scale projects, so transportation construction was not much or fast. There were even such situations: the directly affiliated projects and design units of the Ministry of Communications often had insufficient tasks, and technical forces were idling, but the Ministry of Communications was reluctant to let this group of forces go down to support local transportation construction with seriously insufficient technical forces.

The representatives attending the meeting launched a fierce ideological struggle when discussing these two different lines and different working methods, and finally unified their understanding. Everyone unanimously agreed that the basic points of the whole party and the whole people running transportation and the "local, mass, and popularization" transportation construction line are: under the illumination of the General Line of Socialist Construction, resolutely rely on the unified leadership of local party committees and governments at all levels, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in transportation construction, make full use of local material resources and human, financial, and material resources, face the vast rural areas, mountainous areas, and remote areas, popularize transportation construction in accordance with local conditions, and vigorously carry out the technical revolution in the transportation industry, while promoting new technologies, extensively carry out mass movements to improve tools and innovate technologies. In terms of work arrangements, we must combine the central and local governments, with the local government as the main focus; combine popularization and improvement, with popularization as the main focus; and combine large, medium, and small, with medium and small as the main focus, so that various modes of transportation such as water, land, and air can be developed in a comprehensive manner, so as to build China's comprehensive transportation network as soon as possible.

    全党全民办交通　迅速建成交通运输网
    北方交通工作座谈会确定建设方针路线
    据新华社11日讯　9日在北京闭幕的北方十五个省、市、自治区地方交通工作座谈会，根据总路线的精神，确定了依靠地方，依靠群众，以普及为主，普及与提高相结合的交通建设方针，争取在最短期内建成我国四通八达的交通运输网。
    会议认为过去交通运输部门的工作取得了很大成绩，公路和水运事业基本适应了社会主义建设和生产的需要，并取得了经验。
    会议在检查过去的工作中，指出了在交通运输事业中存在着两个不同的交通建设方针和指导思想。一种是全党全民办交通，依靠地方，依靠群众，以普及为主，普及与提高相结合的“地、群、普”方针。另一种是片面强调垂直领导、专业系统，盲目追求高标准、现代化的“直、专、高”方针。
    会议以事实证明“地、群、普”的方针是交通部门贯彻实现社会主义建设总路线的方针。1956年由于依靠了群众，只用一年的时间，全国就修建了八万多公里的简易道路。目前广大群众在工农业生产大跃进中，建设交通的热情极高。有些地方由于坚持了依靠群众、发动群众自己修建公路的方针，交通事业就迅速得到了发展。黑龙江省明水县最近动员全县群众苦战十天，完成了全县六百多公里的地方道路网，做到乡乡通汽车。河北省蓟县人民用自己的力量建成了全县的公路网，做到了“乡乡有公路，社社通大车”。这些事实都证明按照“地、群、普”的路线办交通事业，就可以发挥地方党委、政府和广大群众对于发展交通事业的积极性和创造性，结果就能做到多快好省。
    会议同时批判了片面的“直、专、高”的指导思想。认为按照“直、专、高”的路线去办交通，必然会形成独家经营，束缚群众手脚，只能建设少数点线工程，而不能在广大地区建设交通，其结果必然是少慢差费。由于“直、专、高”的思想指导，过去交通部以绝大部分精力去搞直属的、近代化的、集中的然而只是少量的工程，交通建设因此就不多不快。甚至出现了这样的情况：交通部直属工程和设计单位经常任务不足，技术力量窝工，交通部却舍不得把这批力量放下去，支援技术力量严重不足的地方交通建设。
    参加会议的代表在讨论这两种不同的路线、不同的工作方法时，展开了激烈的思想斗争，最后才统一了认识。大家一致同意了全党全民办交通和“地、群、普”的交通建设路线的基本点是：在社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，坚决依靠各级地方党委和政府的统一领导，充分发挥广大群众对于交通建设的积极性和创造性，充分利用当地的物质资源和人力、财力、物力，面向广大农村、山区和偏僻地区，因地制宜地普及交通建设，并大力进行交通事业的技术革命，在推广新技术同时，广泛开展改良工具和革新技术的群众运动。在工作安排上，要做到中央和地方相结合，以地方为主；普及和提高相结合，以普及为主；大中小相结合，以中小为主，使水陆空各种运输方式综合发展，以尽快地建成我国四通八达的运输网。
