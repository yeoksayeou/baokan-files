    "Automatic Helmsman" in Testing
    Following the successful testing of automatic train drivers and car drivers, the Soviet Union is now beginning to test the automatic navigation of ships using instruments.
    This test was recently conducted on the Volga River. During the test, the experimental ship was no longer driven by humans but entirely by specialized compasses and automatic instruments. The ship's "automatic helmsman" steered very well, enabling the ship to advance smoothly through the waves along the prescribed route.

    “自动舵手”在试验中
    继自动火车司机和汽车司机试验成功之后，苏联现在又开始试验用仪器自动驾驶船只。
    这项试验是最近在伏尔加河上进行的。试验时，试验船不再由人驾驶而完全由专门的罗盘和自动仪器驾驶。这只船上的“自动舵手”驾驶得很好，它使船只按照规定的航线顺利鼓浪前进。
