Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, June 3rd: The Mongolian "Truth News" published an editorial on May 31st titled "Marxism or Revisionism?" commenting on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

	The article stated that the current stage of development of the communist movement is characterized by: the unprecedented unity of its forces, the further ideological strengthening and consolidation of the international solidarity of the working people, and the continuous development of the ties and cooperation between communist and workers' parties of various countries. The time-tested principles of proletarian internationalism and the ideas of Marxism-Leninism are the foundation for consolidating the fraternal relations between communist and workers' parties.

	The article pointed out that, faced with the vigorous development and strengthening of world socialist forces, imperialists are intensifying their attacks on Marxism-Leninism, the scientific theory of the working class, and on communist and workers' parties, the disseminators and embodiments of this theory. International reactionaries are attempting to weaken the unity of the socialist countries' camp headed by the Soviet Union, split communist and workers' parties, and undermine the unity of the international communist movement through the so-called "national communism" slogan and the use of various revisionist theories. Under these circumstances, the struggle against all forms of opportunist vacillation and distortion, and against revisionism, the main danger to the international communist movement, is of particular importance.

	The article stated that the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which discussed the draft program of the League, left a deep revisionist imprint on the League itself. The refusal of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries to send delegations to the Congress, as well as their objective criticism of the draft program, demonstrates their principled determination to defend Marxism-Leninism. The article wrote: The Yugoslav leaders repeatedly declared at the Congress that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. However, reading the program and the speeches at the Congress makes one feel that this is far from the case. Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, the program revises the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism that have been tested by life and confirmed by revolutionary practice. The drafters of the program departed from the class position of the proletariat in their assessment of the current international situation, the common laws of the transition period, the essence of the state, the leading role of Marxist parties, and other such important issues.

	The article emphasized that the revisionist essence of the program is clearly reflected. Its purpose is to weaken socialist forces and serve imperialist reactionaries.

	The article said that the draft program provides a completely incorrect and distorted explanation of the current international situation.

	The famous declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries emphasized that the transition from capitalism to socialism is the basic content of the present era, and the Russian October Socialist Revolution marked the beginning of this transition. The formation of two opposing camps in the world is the inevitable result of the historically significant process of socialism replacing capitalism through revolution.

	However, disregarding reality, the program ignores the fact that the world is forming two opposing camps, socialist and capitalist, and insists that there are "two military-political blocs," and that "staying outside blocs" is Yugoslavia's advantage and its special contribution to the cause of peace and socialism. This incorrect explanation of the current international situation is obviously intended to find some basis and justification for Yugoslavia's policy of profiting from both the socialist and capitalist camps.

	The program denies the essential difference between the foreign policies of socialist and capitalist countries, and insists that the Soviet Union has adopted "methods of dividing spheres of influence," a "position of strength" policy, and "hegemonism." The program says, "Methods of dividing spheres of influence and other similar political forms appeared as early as the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Allied summit conferences, and have continued to exist after the war." But facts prove that among the major powers, only the Soviet Union has consistently opposed the imperialist policy of dividing spheres of influence and resolutely supported the anti-Hitler liberation struggles of all countries, including the heroic struggle of the Yugoslav people. Similarly, thanks to the efforts and support of the Soviet Union and the just demands of the Mongolian people, Western countries had to recognize the status of our people's democratic state at the Yalta Conference in 1945.

	The article further pointed out that the program whitewashes the aggressive policies of the United States and other imperialist countries in preparing and launching a new world war to seize world hegemony. The Yugoslav leaders in their speeches at the Congress went to great lengths to praise American aid to Yugoslavia.

	American aid to Yugoslavia is praised by Yugoslav leaders as "selfless" and "sincere." But it is not difficult to imagine that the American ruling clique gives Yugoslavia some benefits in order to achieve carefully planned political and strategic goals. American oil tycoon Rockefeller revealed the truth and essence of American "aid" imposed on other countries in a confidential letter to US President Eisenhower in 1956. Prior to this, Rockefeller had served as a special advisor to the US President on "Cold War" strategy and foreign policy issues. In this letter, he emphasized that the United States "should provide assistance to such an extent that the United States develops economic relations with countries receiving 'aid,' and should enable the United States to control the economic lifeline of these countries." Rockefeller cited the experience of enslaving Iran. Rockefeller openly and shamelessly said: "Through economic assistance, we were able to intervene in Iranian oil, and now we have consolidated our roots in the country's economy. Consolidating our economic position in Iran has enabled us to control its entire foreign policy, especially to persuade Iran to join the Baghdad Pact." Rockefeller finally advocated publicizing America's notorious "aid" to other countries everywhere, describing it as "a manifestation of America's sincere and selfless desire to help these countries."

	In light of the above, it can be seen very clearly from where the real danger to the national independence of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia comes, whether from the socialist countries' family headed by the Soviet Union, or from the international imperialism led by the American monopoly capitalists.

	The article wrote that in the historically significant Moscow Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, great importance was attached to the general laws and specific forms of the transition to socialism in different countries. The declaration stated that the proletariat party ignoring national characteristics would inevitably lead it to be divorced from life and the masses, thus causing losses to the cause of socialism. On the other hand, exaggerating the role of national characteristics and departing from the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism regarding socialist revolution and socialist construction under the pretext of considering national characteristics would also inevitably cause losses to the cause of socialism. In order to prevent this, the participants of the meeting declared that they believe it is necessary to simultaneously fight against these two tendencies and implement in practice the principle of skillfully combining general laws with the national characteristics and traditions of each country. The article said that the Marxist-Leninist principle of the universal laws of socialist construction is the ideological foundation of the policies of the communist and workers' parties of the socialist camp. No wonder it is precisely these principles that have now become the target of fierce attacks by imperialist politicians and ideologues. Departing from the Marxist-Leninist foundation, departing from the principles of proletarian internationalism, and embarking on the path of opportunism, revisionism, and nationalism is the result of forgetting and ignoring universal laws.

	The article pointed out that it can be seen from the draft program that the Yugoslav leaders oppose the so-called "ideological monopoly" that they themselves have invented, which is actually to deny the universal laws of the transition to socialism, and to demean these laws as "mechanical pressure" and "top-down compulsion," while at the same time exaggerating the national characteristics of the development of various countries. The Yugoslav leaders regard these characteristics as something absolute, using them to oppose the universal principles and laws of socialist construction – principles and laws that the Soviet Union has followed, and that other countries that have embarked on the path of socialist construction are now also following, although the methods and conditions are different.

	The article pointed out that the experience of the Soviet revolution and socialist construction was obtained at an extremely high price, and was summarized by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Leninism. Despite the various characteristics of Soviet development, this experience is basically the common wealth of all countries. The article wrote that Lenin taught that a correct understanding of the national interests of the proletariat of one country cannot violate their internationalist interests and obligations, which is: to make the greatest efforts within their own country to support and develop the liberation movements of other countries.

	The words and deeds of the Yugoslav leaders during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in October-November 1956 clearly demonstrated the revisionist face of Yugoslavia in action. The fundamentally incorrect position held by Tito and Kadar, among others, on major issues such as the elucidation of the class essence of the Hungarian events and the evaluation of the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian people, naturally met with resolute resistance from various communist and workers' parties, including the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

	The article went on to write: The extremely erroneous interpretations by the Yugoslav leaders of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the dictatorship of the proletariat and on the role and significance of the Marxist party of the working class – the actual situation in Yugoslavia today is a consequence of this erroneous interpretation – prove that they have departed from the path of proletarian internationalism and embarked on the path of revising Marxism-Leninism. The Yugoslav leaders and its newspapers attempt to promote and force other countries to accept the so-called Yugoslav path to socialism, which they claim is the most correct or even the only possible path. At the same time, they ignore the experience of socialist construction in other countries, especially the experience of the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country.

	The article emphasized that it is very noteworthy that the Yugoslav leaders, who claim to be internationalists, limit their internationalism to the equality of all nations. But this so-called internationalism is just a jackal of the same lair as bourgeois and petty-bourgeois nationalism. They verbally acknowledge internationalism, but in fact, they replace internationalism with bourgeois nationalism in propaganda, agitation, and practical work. This is the most prominent feature of Yugoslav revisionism. The systematic revisionist theories and policies in the draft program are essentially contrary to the international communist movement. Ultimately, this theory will only benefit the imperialist reactionary forces in maintaining capitalism in the capitalist world and in implementing capitalist restoration in those countries where capitalism has been eliminated.

	The speeches of some Yugoslav leaders at the Seventh Congress show that they are vaguely repeating the arguments of bourgeois propaganda, which uses clever slander, deception, and distortion to spread doubts about the policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, while at the same time trying to portray imperialism as the defender of freedom and democracy.

	It goes without saying that only the imperialist bloc is interested in weakening socialist forces and splitting socialist countries. And the line of the Yugoslav leaders is actually propagating that the isolated existence of socialist countries from each other is appropriate. The article said that in an era where there is a socialist family, any argument that it is possible to build socialism separately without joining this socialist countries' family objectively harms the cause of peace and socialism. This tendency will disperse and weaken socialist forces.

	The article wrote that the Moscow Declaration pointed out the characteristics of the historically unprecedented new socialist state relations. This relationship is based on the principles of complete equality and respect for territorial integrity, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. But these principles do not include the entire essence of socialist state relations. An inseparable part of their mutual relations is fraternal mutual assistance, which truly embodies the principles of socialist internationalism, which arises from the essence of socialist countries. In the past decade (1947 to 1957), the Soviet Union's direct assistance to Mongolia's socialist construction amounted to more than 1 billion rubles. There are now 300 enterprises built with Soviet assistance in various socialist countries, and this number will reach 478 by 1962. Everyone knows that all socialist countries have helped the Democratic People's Republic of Korea restore its economy destroyed by the war. The People's Republic of China has given great assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other countries. Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and other people's democratic countries in Europe have also given fraternal assistance to the economic construction of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	From these irrefutable facts, the slanderous assertion in the draft program that there are unequal relations between socialist countries, that there are "negative tendencies," and even the phenomenon of one country exploiting another, is untenable. The entire history of the existence and development of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, including the Mongolian People's Republic, proves that this fabrication is baseless nonsense.

	Every honest worker in Mongolia is well aware that the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the cause of the Mongolian people defending and achieving national independence, and has given the Mongolian people truly fraternal assistance in the construction of a new life. Its policy towards the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently followed the principles of proletarian internationalism, and has been consistently based on the sincere desire to help Mongolia transition from backwardness to progress, without seeking any benefits or privileges for itself. On the contrary, it is willing to make sacrifices for the happiness and prosperity of our country.

	The article pointed out that the draft program states that "it is necessary to resolutely oppose any hegemonic tendencies" in the relations within the international workers' movement and between socialist countries. It can be seen that the Yugoslav communists are actually calling on people to reconsider the issue of the Soviet Union's leading role in the world socialist camp and the leading vanguard role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the world communist movement, and are actually calling on people to revise the wording on this issue. All of this cannot but be regarded as a crude attack on the Soviet Union, which is the pillar of peace and social progress, and cannot but be regarded as an attempt to undermine the unity and solidarity of socialist countries. In modern conditions, only those who recognize the Soviet Union as the fortress and center of the world communist and workers' movement, and only those who are determined to defend the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries from the aggression of imperialist reactionary forces can be regarded as true internationalists. Obviously, the achievements of the Soviet people, whether for the struggle against the threat of a new war, or for the development and consolidation of the socialist camp, or for the upsurge of the international communist movement, are of decisive significance.

	The article wrote: The Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the center and leading force of the world communist movement. This is the inevitable result of historical development. The Soviet Union is the world's first and most powerful country that has won socialist victory. It has the richest revolutionary experience in building socialism and can give selfless assistance to the people of other socialist countries, so it should be universally loved and deeply admired.

	Mankind will never forget the countless sacrifices and hardships that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have consciously endured in order to fulfill their internationalist obligations to the working class and working people of the world.

	Due to historical conditions, the Soviet Union plays a special role in the foreign policy of the entire socialist camp, and thus bears extremely important historical responsibility for the results of this policy. However, this special role of the Soviet state will in no way harm the national independence and sovereignty of each socialist country, and on the contrary, will help to protect this independence from imperialist aggression.

	The article pointed out that the drafters of the program seriously distorted the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on the state, repeating the old clichés put forward by veteran opportunists about the "supra-class nature" of the bourgeois state, about capitalism growing into socialism through state capitalism, and so on, which have been negated by life. The article further pointed out that the views of the Yugoslav revisionists on this issue echo the rhetoric of the loyal servants of imperialism – the right-wing social democrats, who maliciously slander the dictatorship of the proletariat, the indispensable main weapon for building socialism and communism.

	As for the Yugoslav views on the withering away of the socialist state, then the Yugoslav's own practices – its much-touted so-called social self-government system – have not confirmed this view.

	The revisionist points in the draft program actually deny the leading role of the Communist Party in overthrowing the capitalist system and building the socialist cause, which is very harmful.

	The article finally pointed out that it can be seen that the program, which pretends to be the latest achievement of Marxist ideology, is essentially intended to make Marxism-Leninism adapt to bourgeois nationalism.

    蒙古“真理报”编辑部的文章说
    南共纲领企图削弱社会主义力量
    南共领导人所谓“置身集团之外”是为了两面找便宜
    新华社乌兰巴托3日电  蒙古“真理报”在5月31日发表了编辑部的题为“马克思主义还是修正主义？”的文章，评论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案。
    文章说，共产主义运动发展的现阶段的特点是：它的力量空前团结，劳动人民的国际团结在思想上进一步加强和巩固，各国共产党和工人党的联系和合作不断发展。久经考验的无产阶级国际主义原则和马克思列宁主义思想是共产党和工人党巩固兄弟关系的基础。
    文章指出，面对着世界社会主义力量的蓬勃发展和加强，帝国主义者对作为工人阶级科学理论的马克思列宁主义以及对作为这个理论的传播者和体现者的共产党和工人党加紧进行进攻。国际反动派企图通过所谓“民族共产主义”口号和利用种种修正主义理论来削弱以苏联为首的社会主义国家阵营的团结，分裂共产党和工人党，破坏国际共产主义运动的团结。在这种情况下，反对各种机会主义的动摇和歪曲的斗争，反对作为对国际共产主义运动的主要危险的修正主义的斗争就具有特别重要的意义。
    文章说，讨论南共纲领草案的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会给南共自己打下了深刻的修正主义的烙印。社会主义国家共产党和工人党拒绝派代表团出席南共代表大会，以及它们对南共纲领草案的客观批评，表明它们坚持原则地决心捍卫马克思列宁主义。文章写道：南共领导人在代表大会上一再声明，南共忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则。但是，阅读南共纲领和代表大会的发言后使人感到远非如此。纲领是在反对教条主义的幌子下，修改经过生活考验并且为革命实践所证实的马克思列宁主义的基本原理。南共纲领的起草人对当前国际局势、过渡时期的共同规律、国家的本质、马克思主义政党的领导作用等等这样一些最重要问题的估计上，离开了无产阶级的阶级立场。
    文章着重指出，南共纲领明显地反映出修正主义的本质。它的目的是削弱社会主义力量，是为帝国主义反动派效劳。
    文章说，南共纲领草案对当前国际局势作了完全不正确的歪曲的解释。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的著名宣言强调指出，从资本主义向社会主义过渡是现时代的基本内容，俄国十月社会主义革命为这个过渡打下了开端。世界形成两个对立的阵营，是社会主义用革命方式代替资本主义这一有世界历史意义的进程的必然结果。
    但是南共纲领不顾现实，无视世界形成社会主义和资本主义两个对立阵营的事实，硬说存在“两个军事政治集团”，而“置身集团之外”是南斯拉夫的优点，是南斯拉夫对和平拥护者和社会主义拥护者的特殊功劳。对当前国际局势这种不正确的解释显然是为了给南斯拉夫在社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营之间两面占便宜的政策寻找某种根据和辩解。
    南共纲领否认社会主义国家和资本主义国家外交政策的本质的区别，硬说苏联采取了“划分势力范围的方法”、“实力地位”政策和“霸权主义”。纲领说，“划分势力范围的方法和其他类似的政治形式早在德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦同盟国首脑会议上就已经出现，而在战后继续存在着”。但是事实证明，在大国之中，只有苏联一贯反对帝国主义划分势力范围的政策，并且坚决支持各国人民的反希特勒的解放斗争，其中包括南斯拉夫人民的英勇斗争。同样地，由于苏联的努力和支持和蒙古人民的正义要求，西方国家在1945年雅尔塔会议上不得不承认我国的人民民主国家的地位。
    文章进一步指出，南共纲领粉饰了美国和其他帝国主义国家准备和发动新的世界大战以夺取世界霸权的侵略政策。南共领导人在代表大会上的发言中极力歌颂美国对南斯拉夫的援助。
    美国对南斯拉夫的援助被南斯拉夫领导人誉为“无私的”、“真诚的”援助。但不难推想得到，美国统治集团给南斯拉夫一些好处，是为了达到处心积虑的政治目的和战略目的。美国石油大王洛克菲勒1956年在给美国总统艾森豪威尔的密信中透露了美国强加于其他国家的“援助”的真象和实质，在这以前，洛克菲勒曾担任美国总统“冷战”策略和外交政策问题特别顾问。他在这封信中强调指出，美国“应当在这样一种范围内给予帮助，即美国同接受
  ‘援助’的国家发展经济关系，应当使美国有可能掌握这些国家的经济命脉”。洛克菲勒引证了奴役伊朗的经验。洛克菲勒公然无耻地说：“通过经济援助，我们得以插手伊朗石油，现在我们在这个国家的经济中已经根底巩固了。巩固我们在伊朗的经济阵地使我们有可能控制它的整个外交政策，特别是说服伊朗加入巴格达条约。”洛克菲勒最后主张到处大肆宣扬美国对其他国家臭名远扬的“援助”，把它形容为“美国真诚和无私地希望帮助这些国家的表现”。
    就上述情况来看，就可以十分清楚地看到，对南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的国家独立的真正危险来自何方，是来自以苏联为首的社会主义国家大家庭呢，还是来自美国垄断资本家所领导的国际帝国主义。
    文章写道，在社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议有历史意义的莫斯科宣言中，极其重视不同国家向社会主义过渡的一般规律和具体形式的问题。宣言中说，无产阶级政党忽视民族特点不可避免地会使它脱离生活脱离群众，从而给社会主义事业带来损失。另一方面，夸大民族特点的作用，借口考虑本国特点而离开马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍真理，也必然会给社会主义事业带来损失。为了防止这点，会议参加者声明，他们认为必须同时对这两种倾向作斗争，在实践中实现巧妙地把一般规律同每一个国家的民族特点和传统相结合的原则。文章说，马克思列宁主义关于社会主义建设的普遍规律的原则，是社会主义阵营各国共产党和工人党政策的思想基础。无怪乎现在正是这些原则成了帝国主义政客和思想家猛烈攻击的对象。脱离马克思列宁主义基础、脱离无产阶级国际主义原则、走上机会主义、修正主义和民族主义的立场，这就是遗忘和忽视普遍规律的结果。
    文章指出，从南共纲领草案中可以看出，南共领导人反对他们自己所臆造出来的所谓
  “思想垄断”，其实就是否定向社会主义过渡的普遍规律，而把这些规律贬为“机械压力”、
  “自上而下的强迫”，同时却夸大各国发展的民族特点。南共领导人把这种特点说成是绝对的东西，用这些特点来反对社会主义建设的普遍原则和规律——苏联遵循过这些原则和规律，其他走上社会主义建设道路的国家现在也在遵循这些原则和规律，虽然方式和条件是不相同的。
    文章指出，苏联革命和社会主义建设的经验是用极高的代价取得的，并且由苏联共产党综合在列宁主义之中，尽管苏联的发展有种种特点，但这种经验基本上是一切国家的共同的财富。文章写道，列宁教导说，正确理解一个国家的无产者的民族利益不可能违背他们的国际主义利益和义务，这种义务就是：在自己国家内尽最大努力支持和发展其他国家的解放运动。
    南斯拉夫领导人在匈牙利1956年10月—11月反革命叛乱时期的言行清楚地表明了见诸行动的南斯拉夫修正主义的面目。铁托和卡德尔等人在对匈牙利事件的阶级实质的阐述，对苏军援助匈牙利人民的估价等重大问题上所持的根本不正确的立场很自然地遭到了各个共产党和工人党、其中包括蒙古人民革命党的坚决反击。
    文章接着写道：南共领导人对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政、关于工人阶级的马克思主义政党的作用和意义的学说的极端错误的解释——现今南斯拉夫的实际情况就是这种错误解释的后果——证明他们已经脱离了无产阶级国际主义原则的道路而走上了修正马克思列宁主义的道路。南共领导人和它的报刊企图宣扬和强迫其他国家接受所谓南斯拉夫的社会主义道路，他们把这种道路说成是最正确的或者甚至是唯一可能的道路，与此同时，他们却忽视了其他国家的社会主义建设的经验，首先是世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联的经验。
    文章强调指出，非常值得注意的是：自命为国际主义者的南共领导人，把自己的国际主义仅限于各民族的平等。但这种所谓国际主义同资产阶级和小资产阶级的民族主义是一丘之貉。它们口头上承认国际主义，而事实上，在宣传、鼓动和实际工作中却以资产阶级民族主义来代替国际主义，这是南斯拉夫修正主义最突出的特点。在南共纲领草案中成系统的修正主义的理论和政策，实质上是同国际共产主义运动背道而驰的。归根结底，这种理论只会有利于帝国主义反动势力去在资本主义世界中维护资本主义，并在那些资本主义已被消灭了的国家里实行资本主义复辟。
    南斯拉夫某些领导人在南共第七次代表大会上的发言说明，他们是在含糊其词地重复资产阶级宣传的论据，这种宣传用巧妙的诽谤、蒙骗和歪曲的办法散布对苏联和人民民主国家政策的怀疑，同时极力把帝国主义描绘成是自由和民主的捍卫者。
    用不着证明，对于削弱社会主义力量和分裂社会主义国家感到兴趣的只是帝国主义集团。而南共领导人的路线实际上是在宣传社会主义国家相互隔绝地孤立存在是合宜的。文章说，在存在着社会主义大家庭的时代，任何关于能够不加入这个社会主义国家大家庭而单独地建设社会主义的论断，都在客观上给和平和社会主义事业带来损失。这种倾向会分散和削弱社会主义力量。
    文章写道，莫斯科宣言指出了历史上前所未有的全新的社会主义国家关系的特点。这种关系建立在完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则上。但是这些原则并没有包括社会主义国家关系的全部实质。它们相互关系的一个不可分割的部分是兄弟互助，这种互助真正体现了社会主义国际主义的原则，这是从社会主义国家的本质所产生的。最近十年来（1947至1957），苏联对蒙古人民社会主义建设的直接援助达十亿多卢布。现在各社会主义国家中由苏联帮助建设的企业有三百个，到1962年将达到四百七十八个。大家知道，所有社会主义国家都帮助了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国恢复被战争破坏了的经济。中华人民共和国给了蒙古人民共和国、越南民主共和国以及其他国家很大的帮助。捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和欧洲其他人民民主国家也给了蒙古人民共和国的经济建设以兄弟帮助。
    从这些不可辩驳的事实看来，南共纲领草案硬说社会主义国家之间有不平等的关系、有
  “消极的倾向”，甚至有一国剥削另一国的现象，这种诽谤性的论断是站不住脚的。欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家，其中包括蒙古人民共和国的存在和发展的全部历史，都证明这种捏造是毫无根据的无稽之谈。
    蒙古每一个诚实的劳动者都很清楚，苏联在蒙古人民保卫和取得民族独立的事业中起了决定性作用，并且在新生活的建设中给了蒙古人民以真正兄弟般的援助，它对蒙古人民共和国的政策，一贯不渝地遵循着无产阶级国际主义的原则，一贯本着帮助蒙古从落后过渡到进步的真诚愿望，并不为自己攫取什么利益和特权，而且相反，为我国的幸福和繁荣而甘受牺牲。
    文章指出，南共纲领草案指出，在国际工人运动内部和社会主义国家之间的关系中，“必须坚决反对任何霸权倾向”。可见，南斯拉夫共产党人实际上是在号召人们重新考虑苏联在世界社会主义阵营中的领导作用问题、苏联共产党在世界共产主义运动中的主导先锋作用问题，实际上是号召人们修改在这个问题上的提法。这一切不能不认为是对于作为和平和社会进步的支柱的苏联进行粗暴的攻击，不能不认为是企图破坏社会主义国家的统一和团结，在现代条件下，只有那些承认苏联是世界共产主义和工人运动的堡垒和中心的人，只有那些决心保卫苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家不受帝国主义反动势力侵犯的人，才能被认为是真正的国际主义者。很明显，苏联人民的成就，无论是对于反对新战争威胁斗争，还是对于社会主义阵营的发展和巩固，以及对于国际共产主义运动的高涨说来，都具有决定性的意义。
    文章写道：苏联和苏联共产党是世界共产主义运动的中心和领导力量，这是历史发展的必然结果。苏联是世界上第一个和最强大的获得了社会主义胜利的国家，它拥有建设社会主义的最丰富的革命经验并且能给其他社会主义各国人民以无私援助，所以它应该受到普遍爱戴和深深敬仰。
    人类永远不会忘记在苏联共产党领导下的苏联人民为实现自己对全世界工人阶级和劳动人民的国际主义义务而自觉地承受的无数牺牲和苦难。
    由于历史条件，苏联在整个社会主义阵营的外交政策方面起着特殊的作用，从而对这一政策的结果负有极重大的历史责任。然而，苏维埃国家的这个特殊作用无论如何也不致损害每一个社会主义国家的民族独立和主权，而且相反，会有助于保护这种独立，以防帝国主义的侵害。
    文章指出，南共纲领草案起草人严重地歪曲了马克思列宁主义关于国家学说的基本原理，重弹了老牌机会主义者提出的关于资产阶级国家的“超阶级性”、关于资本主义通过国家资本主义长入社会主义等等已被生活所否定了的陈词滥调。文章进一步指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者在这个问题上的观点是同帝国主义的忠实奴仆——右翼社会党人的论调相呼应的，这些人恶意诽谤无产阶级专政这个建设社会主义和共产主义必不可缺的主要武器。
    至于说到南共关于社会主义国家消亡的观念，那末，就是南斯拉夫自己的做法——它所大肆吹嘘的所谓社会自治制度也没有证实这个观念。
    南共纲领草案的修正主义论点实际上是否定了共产党在推翻资本主义制度和建设社会主义事业中的领导作用，这是非常有害的。
    文章最后指出，可见，冒充马克思主义思想的最新成就的南共纲领，实质上就是要使马克思列宁主义去适应资产阶级民族主义。
