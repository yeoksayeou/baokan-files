Answering readers' questions:

    Since the spring of this year, we have continuously received letters from young men and women in society, and some have even come to visit in person, requesting to go to the border areas to reclaim wasteland for production. This shows the high enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism.

    We are a socialist country, and everything we do should be planned. Therefore, the allocation of large numbers of laborers needs to be arranged uniformly by the labor department. In accordance with this spirit, the following principles should be followed in dealing with young people who request to participate in border construction:

    1. Unemployed and out-of-school youth in society who volunteer to reclaim wasteland in the border areas must be considered and handled uniformly by the local people's government and the labor department. On the principle of not affecting the planned organization and allocation of local labor, volunteers for wasteland reclamation can participate in reclamation after being introduced by the labor department and approved by the Ministry of Land Reclamation. In-service and in-school youth and members of agricultural cooperatives will generally not be accepted. If the unit and relevant departments agree, and the transfer procedures are obtained from the labor department, they may be accepted individually.

    2. The conditions for volunteering for wasteland reclamation are: clear political background, young men and women aged 18 to 35, free from disease, able to endure hardship and willing to settle and produce in the border areas for a long time.

    3. When young people in society request reclamation, they can contact the local labor department, and after obtaining the consent of the local labor department, they can directly contact the agricultural reclamation departments of the relevant provinces or the Ministry of Land Reclamation. When going, it is necessary to complete the household registration and grain transfer procedures, and bring sufficient luggage and clothing. In principle, travel expenses are borne by the individual.

    At present, many state-owned farms are vigorously developing, and generally need to supplement labor. Hubei, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions are in more urgent need of labor. The key reclamation area of ​​the Ministry of Land Reclamation is the area east of Mishan and Jiamusi in Heilongjiang Province, with a wasteland area of ​​more than 60 million mu. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is planned to reclaim 20 to 30 million mu of wasteland in the Heilongjiang area, so a large amount of labor is required.

    志愿到边疆垦荒的人要具备那些条件办理什么手续？
    今春以来，我们不断接到社会上青年男女的来信，有的还亲自来访要求到边疆去垦荒生产。这说明广大群众建设社会主义的热情高涨。
    我们是社会主义的国家，办一切事情都应有计划。因此，大批劳动力的调配，需由劳动部门统一安排。根据这一精神，对于要求参加边疆建设的青年，应本着以下精神处理：
    一、社会上失学、失业的青年，凡志愿到边疆去垦荒者，必须由当地人民政府和劳动部门统一考虑处理。在不影响当地劳动力有计划地组织调配原则下，志愿垦荒者经劳动部门介绍、农垦部同意后，即可参加垦荒。在职、在学的青年和农业社社员，原则上不吸收。如本单位和有关部门同意，并取得劳动部门的调动手续，可个别吸收。
    二、志愿垦荒的条件是：政治面貌清楚，年满十八岁以上、三十五岁以下的男女青年，无疾病，能吃苦耐劳，并愿长期在边疆安家生产者。
    三、社会青年要求垦荒时，可与当地劳动部门联系，经当地劳动部门同意后，再由他们直接向各该省农垦部门或农垦部联系。去时，需要办好户口、粮食迁移手续，并带足行李衣物。路费原则上自备。
    目前，很多国营农场都在大力发展，一般均须补充劳动力。湖北、江西、云南、甘肃、青海、新疆、内蒙古等省、区，需要劳动力更为迫切。农垦部的重点垦荒区是黑龙江省的密山和佳木斯以东地区，荒地面积约六千多万亩。第二个五年计划期间，在黑龙江地区计划开垦荒地两千至三千万亩，因此需要劳力数量较大。
