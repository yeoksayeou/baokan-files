The Gansu Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of its Standing Committee immediately after the release of the documents from the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to discuss the propaganda work for the session. The meeting decided that the entire party should be mobilized immediately to organize a mighty propaganda force. The first secretaries of party committees at all levels should personally take charge and, over the course of a month, vigorously promote the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. The aim is to make this known to every household, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and transform the general line into a tremendous material force for promoting socialist construction throughout the province.

The Standing Committee believes that propaganda forms should be tailored to local conditions and be flexible and diverse. For cadres in government offices, enterprises, and schools, the study of the documents from the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress should be closely integrated with the current rectification movement, conducting in-depth reviews of their work and ideological style. One-third of their time each week could be devoted to carefully studying and discussing these documents. For workers and peasants, all propaganda tools, such as newspapers, radio, dramas, movies, music, and art, as well as Party members, League members, and activists, should be organized to carry out in-depth and extensive propaganda in various lively forms. Discussions should also be organized to bring the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses into fuller play, to attack all right-leaning conservative ideas, and to break down superstitions, so that more miracles will emerge in our socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 2nd: On the 1st, Shenyang City mobilized a propaganda army of more than 150,000 people to promote the general line of socialist construction, bringing the propaganda activities of the past few days to a climax. Hundreds of propaganda trucks raced around the city, and groups of people were promoting the message on every street and in every alley.

The propaganda army was full of enthusiasm. The literary and artistic propaganda teams mobilized by more than 100 factories in the Tiexi District used real people and events from the great leap forward in the factories to vividly promote the spirit and essence of the general line, which was welcomed by the audience.

The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shenyang mobilized a propaganda army of more than 8,000 people and distributed more than 30,000 propaganda posters and pasted many street poems and slogans in various streets of the urban area. The old ladies' choir of Dashizi Street in Beiguan District gathered at three or four o'clock in the morning, learned the song "The General Line is Really Good" on the spot, and then performed in more than 30 places, with more than 30,000 people listening to their performances.
