    Chimpanzees Living in the Zoo
    Jiang Shaozhong
    The Beijing Zoo today exhibited a new pair of chimpanzees. This pair of chimpanzees was transported from the Soviet Union at the end of last month. In the past half month, they have developed a strong affection for the zookeepers here. Every morning, the keepers wash their faces. Before they eat, the keepers also shake hands with them, and then let them sit on chairs and hold their milk bottles like children to drink milk, and pick up spoons to eat food.
    There are three types of apes: gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. In terms of physiological structure, they are all very close to humans. However, the first two are more robust than chimpanzees, have greater strength, and are also very irritable in temperament, making them more difficult to raise than chimpanzees.
    The pair of chimpanzees in the Beijing Zoo are two cubs. One is almost one year old, and the other is even smaller. Their kind live in the dense jungle areas of West and Central African Congo, and like to be together in groups, mainly eating wild fruits, wild vegetables, and miscellaneous grains. They are much smarter than other apes and monkeys, and can learn to ride bicycles, skate, unbutton clothes, smoke, and other performances, and can also stand up and walk upright like humans.
    Chimpanzees are a relatively difficult animal to raise. If not managed properly, they are prone to bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other diseases. However, the two chimpanzees in the Beijing Zoo have been living very healthily since they were transported here. It seems that the current climate in Beijing is also suitable for them, but they need to be covered with quilts at night to sleep. (Attached picture)

    黑猩猩生活在动物园
    蒋绍仲
    北京动物园里今天新展出了一对黑猩猩。这对黑猩猩是上月底才从苏联运来的。半个月来，它们已经同这里的饲养人员发生了浓厚的感情。每天早晨饲养人员就要给它们洗脸。在它们吃饭以前，饲养员还要同它们握握手，然后让它们坐在椅子上像小孩一样地自己抱起奶瓶来吃奶，拿起勺子来吃食物。
    猩猩有大猩猩、猩猩、黑猩猩三种之分。在生理构造上都非常接近人类。不过前两种比黑猩猩更魁梧，力气更大，性情也非常暴躁，比黑猩猩难饲养。
    北京动物园里的这一对黑猩猩，是两只幼兽。一只将近一岁，另一只还要小些。它们的同类们都是生活在非洲西部及中非刚果的茂密丛林地带，喜欢成群地在一起，主要以野果、野菜、杂粮为食。它们比其他猿猴类聪明得多，可以学会骑车、溜冰、解扣、吸烟等表演，还可以像人一样地站起来直立行走。
    黑猩猩是一种比较难饲养的动物，如果管理不好，容易感染支气管炎、肺炎和结核等疾病。不过北京动物园里的这两只黑猩猩，从运到以后一直生活得很健康。看起来北京现在的气候对它们也合适，只是夜里需要给它们盖上被子睡觉。（附图片）
