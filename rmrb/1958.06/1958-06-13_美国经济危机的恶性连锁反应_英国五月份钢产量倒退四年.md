Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th. Recent statistics from some important industries in Britain reflect the increasing impact of the US economic crisis on the British economy.

Steel production in May fell to its lowest level in four years. Its weekly output fell to 379,000 tons, down 7% from April (weekly output of 400,780 tons) and nearly 16% from a year ago (weekly output of 450,000 tons). Calculated at an annual rate, steel production in April fell from 23 million tons a year ago to 19.7 million tons. This is the result of reduced demand in both domestic and foreign markets.

The "Financial Times" pointed out today: "Domestic market demand for almost all steel products has generally shrunk." At the same time, the value of British exports of finished steel products in the first four months of this year decreased by more than 8% compared with the same period last year, partly due to the fall in steel prices.

As a result of the reduction in foreign trade in the capitalist world, the United Kingdom has encountered particular difficulties in the shipping and shipbuilding industries. According to statistics from the British Maritime Association, at the beginning of April this year, 156 British ships (totaling 729,000 tons) were idle in British ports. This is an increase of nearly 120,000 tons compared with the beginning of March, and an increase of more than 693,000 tons compared with a year ago. Under these circumstances, the shipbuilding industry did not receive any new foreign shipbuilding orders in the first quarter of this year, and the original foreign orders totaling 100,900 tons and domestic orders totaling 73,500 tons were also cancelled.

Figures released today by the Cotton Textile Management Committee show that the weekly output of cotton products, cotton yarn, and rayon fabrics in April fell to its lowest level since mid-1957. The number of workers in the textile industry sector was drastically reduced by 4,000 in April.

    美国经济危机的恶性连锁反应
    英国五月份钢产量倒退四年
    新华社伦敦12日电　英国某些重要工业最近的统计数字反映出，美国经济危机对英国经济的影响越来越大。
    5月份的钢产量下降到了四年中最低的水平。它的每周产量跌到三十七万九千吨，比4月份（每周产量四十万零七千八百吨）下降了7％，比一年前（每周四十五万吨）下降了将近16％。以年率计算，4月份钢产量从一年前的二千三百万吨降到了一千九百七十万吨。这是国内和国外市场的需求减少的结果。
    “金融时报”今天指出：“国内市场对几乎所有钢制成品的需求都普遍缩减。”同时，今年头四个月英国出口的钢制成品的价值比去年同期减少了8％以上，这部分地是由于钢价下跌。
    由于资本主义世界对外贸易缩减的结果，英国在航运业和造船工业方面遭到了特殊的困难。据英国海运协会统计，今年4月初，英国各港口有一百五十六艘英国船只（共达七十二万九千吨）闲置不用。比3月初增加了将近十二万吨，比一年前增加了六十九万三千多吨。在这种情况下，今年第一季度造船业没有接到新的外国造船订货，而且原有的总数达十万零九千吨的外国订货和总数达七万三千五百吨的国内订货也被取消了。
    棉织业管理委员会今天发表的数字表明，4月份棉制品、棉纱和人造纤维织品的每周产量降到了1957年年中以来最低的水平。纺织工业部门的工人人数4月份剧减了四千人。
