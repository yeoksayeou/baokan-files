　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The "Akahata" recently published a statement issued by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on May 26 regarding the results of the Japanese general election. The statement pointed out that in this general election, the democratic forces in Japan have been further strengthened. Through this general election, the democratic parties in Japan that are demanding peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards have secured enough seats to prevent the Liberal Democratic Party government from revising the constitution. The statement pointed out that in order to hinder the progress of democratic forces, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Kishi Nobusuke government not only openly spent billions of yen in election funds to buy votes, but also influenced the election by carrying out blatant suppression of the Japanese Communist Party, trade unions, especially the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, and the Japan Teachers' Union. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government also carried out a series of deceptive activities in the election. However, the democratic forces still overcame the conspiracies and suppression of the reactionaries and won victory in this general election.

    The statement pointed out that, according to a reasonable proportional representation system, the one million votes supporting the Communist Party in this election would be enough to elect about ten Communist Party candidates as members of parliament. These Communist Party voters are people who follow the Communist Party's path of peace, independence, and democracy and strive for social progress. They are the most advanced people in the Japanese people and agree to cooperate with the Communist Party to form a united front as a new political force in Japan. The Communist Party will unite closely with the masses.

    The statement pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government has publicly stated that it will submit a "small constituency system" bill to the next regular Diet session, which will be more conducive to the conservative parties' manipulation of elections. This will be a step taken by the Kishi Nobusuke group to realize its conspiracy to revise the constitution. The statement said that faced with the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to succumb to the United States and revive militarism, it is even more necessary for Japan's democratic forces to carry out a common and active struggle. Striving to unite democratic forces to form a national democratic united front has become a particularly urgent task at present. To this end, the statement calls on the entire party to immediately and closely unite all the democratic forces that have grown stronger in the general election.

    The statement finally called on Communist Party members and Japanese democratic forces to further unite and strive for victory in the Senate elections and local elections to be held next year.

    日共中央就大选结果发表文告
    号召进步力量结成民族民主战线
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”最近刊载了日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会在5月26日就日本大选结果发表的文告。文告指出，在这次大选中，日本民主势力已经进一步壮大。通过这次大选，日本要求和平、独立、民主和提高生活水平的民主党派已经确保足够的议席，来阻止自由民主党政府修改宪法。文告指出，自由民主党和岸信介政府为了阻碍民主势力前进，不仅公然花费了几十亿日元的选举资金收买选票，还通过对日本共产党、工会，特别是对全递信从业员工会、全国电气通信工会和日本教职员工会进行露骨的镇压，来影响选举。同时，岸信介政府在大选中还进行了一系列的欺骗活动。但是，民主势力还是战胜了反动派的阴谋和镇压，在这次大选中获得了胜利。
    文告指出，按照合理的比例代表制，在这次大选中支持共产党的一百万选票足够使共产党候选人有十名左右当选为议员。这些支持共产党的选民是遵循共产党的和平、独立和民主以及争取社会进步的道路而奋斗的人，他们在日本人民中是最先进的人物，而且赞成同共产党合作以结成一个作为日本新的政治力量的统一战线。共产党将同群众紧密地团结起来。
    文告指出，岸信介政府已经公开表示要在下届平时国会上提出更有利于保守政党操纵选举的“小选举区制”法案。这将是岸信介集团为实现修改宪法的阴谋而采取的步骤。文告说，面对岸信介政府屈从美国和复活军国主义的阴谋，日本的民主力量更有必要进行共同的积极的斗争。努力团结民主势力结成民族民主统一战线已经成为当前特别迫切的任务。为此，文告号召全党把在大选中壮大起来的所有民主力量立即紧密地团结起来。
    文告最后号召共产党党员和日本民主力量进一步团结起来，争取在明年举行的参议院选举和地方选举中获得胜利。
