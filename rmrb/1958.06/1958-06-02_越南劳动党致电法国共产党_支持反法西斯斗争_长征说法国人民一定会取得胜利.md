　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 31st: The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on May 30th, stating that we firmly support the current anti-fascist struggle of the French people, and sincerely congratulate the French people on smashing all the conspiracies of the fascists and safeguarding the French republican system under the leadership of the French Communist Party and with the sympathy and support of the working class and working people all over the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, said at a cadre conference held in Hanoi on May 31st that although the French people's anti-fascist struggle still faces many difficulties, they will certainly achieve victory.
    Truong Chinh pointed out that the riots launched by French fascists and militarists in Algeria and Corsica prove that the French bourgeoisie, especially its most reactionary elements, can no longer use the republican system and democracy (even if it is bourgeois democracy) to rule the French people. It must turn to open, Hitler-style dictatorial means to deal with the domestic situation, continue the Algerian War, and continue to implement its policy of subservience to the United States.
    Truong Chinh pointed out that the French working class, under the leadership of the French Communist Party, has shown its determination to defend the republican system, thus showing that they are loyal to the democratic traditions of France. He said that the main factor determining the victory of the French people is the unity and struggle of the French working class and people under the leadership of the French Communist Party, and this factor is developing vigorously.
    He pointed out that the strengthening of the Algerian people's resistance struggle, the development of national liberation movements in French colonies, and the support of people all over the world are factors that are conducive to the French people's struggle.
    He also said that the Vietnamese and French people are comrades-in-arms, and they have experienced many difficult days in the struggle against the common enemy – French imperialism. He said that the Vietnamese working class and people have been closely watching and warmly supporting the French people's struggle against fascism and in defense of the republican system.
    Truong Chinh delivered this speech at a conference attended by more than 1,000 cadres of the Vietnamese Labor Party and government officials. Many members of the Central Committee of the Labor Party attended the conference. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution expressing support for the anti-fascist struggle of the French people and the French Communist Party.

　　越南劳动党致电法国共产党
    支持反法西斯斗争
    长征说法国人民一定会取得胜利
    据新华社河内31日电　越南劳动党中央5月30日打电报给法国共产党中央说，我们坚决支持法国人民当前的反法西斯斗争，并且衷心祝贺法国人民在法国共产党的领导下和在全世界工人阶级和劳动人民的同情和支持下，粉碎法西斯分子的一切阴谋，保卫住法国的共和制度。
    新华社河内1日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南劳动党中央委员会政治局委员长征5月31日在河内举行的一次干部大会上说，法国人民的反法西斯斗争虽然还面临着许多困难，但是一定会取得胜利。
    长征指出，法国的法西斯分子和军国主义分子在阿尔及利亚和科西嘉发动的暴乱证明，法国资产阶级特别是它的最反动的分子已经不能够再利用共和国政体和民主（即使它是资产阶级民主）去统治法国人民，它必须转而依赖公开的、希特勒式的独裁手段去应付国内局势，并且继续进行阿尔及利亚战争和继续执行它屈从于美国的政策。
    长征指出，法国工人阶级在法国共产党领导下表示决心保卫共和制度，从而显示出他们是忠于法国的民主传统的。他说，决定法国人民的胜利的主要因素是法国工人阶级和人民在法国共产党的领导下的团结和斗争，这个因素正在有力地发展着。
    他指出，阿尔及利亚人民的抵抗斗争的加强、法国各殖民地民族解放运动的发展和全世界人民的支持是有利于法国人民的斗争的因素。
    他还说，越南和法国两国人民是战友，他们在反对共同的敌人——法国帝国主义者的斗争中经历过许多艰难的日子。他说，越南工人阶级和人民一直在密切注意和热烈支持法国人民反对法西斯主义和保卫共和政体的斗争。
    长征是在一千多名越南劳动党的干部和政府负责人员参加的大会上发表这次讲话的，劳动党的许多中央委员出席了这次大会。大会一致通过了决议，表示支持法国人民和法国共产党的反法西斯斗争。
