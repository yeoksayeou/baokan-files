The Inspiration of a Letter
    Ying Lin

    In Shanghai, a female worker went to the reception room of the Shanghai Dongchang District People's Court twice to discuss her marriage problems. The first time, she was received by a female comrade who, before she could finish speaking, told her to go back and think about it, so she left in tears. The second time she went, a male comrade received her warmly and talked with her in detail, which made her very satisfied. The female worker wrote a letter to the president of the court about this matter, criticizing the female comrade for being bureaucratic and arrogant, and praising the male comrade for his sincere and patient work style.

    The leading cadres of the Dongchang District People's Court, which had undergone rectification, attached great importance to this letter from the people and immediately made it public, asking everyone to discuss the matter. Some people thought that the female comrade's work style was not good and that she had not fully established the concept of serving the masses. However, others thought it was just an occasional attitude problem. Some even said that it was impossible to satisfy everyone in reception work. Others, in connection with this matter, examined their own experiences of going to the grassroots to handle cases, saying that although they verbally said it was to facilitate the masses and take care of production, they were always thinking about their own convenience and even thought that whether to take care of the masses or not was up to them to decide. After discussions and debates through big-character posters and forums, the problem was satisfactorily resolved. Not only did the female comrade realize that the root cause of her mistake was her lack of the thoughts and feelings of the working people, but many comrades also admitted that they still lacked firm and clear thoughts and feelings and a work style of serving the masses.

    It seems like just a small matter, but it is precisely such a small matter that gives us inspiration. The great achievements of the rectification movement, whether in the Dongchang District People's Court or other units, are beyond doubt. However, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, it is impossible to imagine that a single rectification movement can solve all contradictions. To finally eliminate all remnants of the exploiting classes and the exploiting system from people's minds, that is, all old thoughts and old habits, is a much more difficult task than eliminating the exploiting classes economically. Problems in this area cannot all be solved in one movement, and even some problems that have been solved will re-emerge under suitable soil and climate conditions, requiring them to be re-solved. At the same time, according to the laws of the development of things, even if the original contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise on a new basis. Only by constantly resolving contradictions can we advance our cause non-stop.

    Since contradictions exist at all times and in all places, what should we do? Comrade Liu Shaoqi has already pointed out in his report that we should use the method of rectification, that is, the methods of great airing of views, great contending, great debates, and posting big-character posters, as a regular method for transforming thoughts and improving work. To do this, we should, like the leaders of the Dongchang District Court, be good at grasping typical and fundamental problems in our work, organizing the masses to discuss and debate, continuing to resolve contradictions that have not been resolved or have not been resolved thoroughly in the past, and resolving new contradictions in a timely manner. If we can do this, our organs, enterprises, rural areas, troops, and schools will be able to maintain a lively and vigorous political situation and achieve greater leaps forward.

    一封来信的启示
    应麟
    上海市有个女工为自己的婚姻问题，到上海东昌区人民法院接待室去了两次。第一次接待她的是一位女同志，还没有等她把话说完，这位女同志就让她回去考虑考虑，她只好含泪而去了。第二次去时，一位男同志热情地接待了她，和她详细地谈了一下，她很满意。这位女工就这件事给法院院长写了一封信，批评那个女同志有官气和骄气，同时表扬了那个男同志的诚恳耐心的工作作风。
    经过整风的东昌区人民法院的领导干部，很重视这封人民来信，立即把它公布出来，要求大家就这件事展开讨论。有人认为那个女同志的作风不好，还没有完全树立起为群众服务的观点，但是也有人认为只是偶尔的态度问题；有的人甚至说，接待工作要人人满意是办不到的；也有人联系这件事检查自己下基层办案，口头上是为了便利群众和照顾生产，但思想上总在考虑自己的方便，甚至认为照顾不照顾应由我决定。经过大字报和座谈会的讨论和辩论以后，问题是圆满地解决了，不但那位女同志认识到，她犯错误的根源是还缺乏劳动人民的思想感情，而且不少同志都承认自己还缺乏坚定的、明确的为群众办事的思想感情和作风。
    说起来，这似乎只是一件很小的事情，然而正是这样的小事情给了我们启示。整风运动的伟大成果，不论在东昌区人民法院或其他单位，都是无可怀疑的。但是，正如刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议上的报告中所说，不可能设想经过一次整风运动，就把所有的矛盾统统解决了。从人们的心理上最后地消灭剥削阶级和剥削制度的一切残余，即一切旧的思想和旧的习惯，这是比在经济上消灭剥削阶级要困难得多的任务。属于这方面的问题，不仅不可能在一次运动中都解决了，而且就是有些已经解决的问题，在适宜的土壤和气候条件下，又会重新冒出头来，又需要重新加以解决。同时按照事物发展的规律，即使原有的矛盾都解决了，也会在新的基础上产生新的矛盾；只有不断地把矛盾解决，才能使我们的事业马不停蹄地前进。
    矛盾既然时时有、处处有，怎么办呢？刘少奇同志在他的报告中也已经给我们指出来了，就是要用整风的方法，即大鸣大放大争大辩和贴大字报的方法，作为改造思想和改进工作的经常方法。要作到这样，就应该像东昌区法院的领导者，善于抓住工作中带有典型性和根本性的问题，组织群众进行讨论和辩论，继续解决过去没有解决或解决得不彻底的矛盾，并及时地解决新发生的矛盾。能够这样作，我们的机关、企业、农村、部队和学校，就能够经常保持生动活泼的政治局面，就能够跃进再跃进。
