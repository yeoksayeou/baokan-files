A: Now, let's perform a crosstalk for everyone.
B: That's not right, please don't address me like that.
A: How should I address you?
B: You are the Party Secretary of Linxi Mine, and I am a coal miner. We are superior and subordinate. I can't take you addressing me like that!
A: Comrade, you must have mistaken me for someone else, right?
B: Ah, I mistook you! Please stand still so I can take another look. (Looks him up and down)
A: How about it? You were wrong, weren't you? I am obviously an actor who often performs crosstalk with Hou Baolin!
B: Oh, no wonder I often see you at the club.
A: Let me tell you: Secretary Wei is in an emergency meeting at the office. He's stuck in meetings every day.
B: Sounds like he's quite busy.
A: Meeting after meeting, how can he come here and enjoy himself with the workers?
B: Listening to you, it seems Secretary Wei is not very concerned about the cultural activities of the workers.
A: Not only is he unconcerned, but the Propaganda Department once convened a mobilization meeting for propaganda work.
B: Did he participate?
A: Heh heh! Not only did he not go, but he turned the head of the Propaganda Department away.
B: That's a bit out of line.
A: Later, the head of the department said that propaganda work is the vanguard of all work. Without the Party's propaganda work, it would be difficult to do anything well.
B: That's right.
A: And what Lenin said… said a lot of theory.
B: Completely correct, he must have gone this time.
A: Still didn't go.
B: Why not?
A: The secretary said again, now the mine's output is very tight, and the work plan hasn't been completed for more than ten days. How can I have time to participate in your affairs!
B: Wow! The Party Secretary doesn't care about propaganda work.
A: It's not that he doesn't care, he doesn't have time.
B: I don't think it's that he doesn't have time; he's purely monopolizing administrative work! Hey, comrade, may I ask if this is happening now or in the past?
A: This is the situation before the rectification campaign.
B: What is this Secretary Wei like now?
A: Now it's different. Because of the rectification campaign and the great blooming and contending, the workers made criticisms. The Party organization put forward the great call for leading cadres at all levels to achieve "six togethers": eat together, live together, work together, study together, meet together, and enjoy entertainment together.
B: This is an effective measure to change the leadership's work style.
A: He realized his own shortcomings, and now he is much better.
B: With transformation, there will be improvement.
A: And he proposed the "Six Togethers."
B: What are the "Six Togethers"?
A: Eat together.
B: Ah, what does "eat together" mean?
A: According to the decision of the Party committee, the meals in the old banquet hall were canceled.
B: Eat at home.
A: Sometimes they even go to the big cafeteria, like the workers, queuing up to buy meal tickets.
B: This is a kind of change in work style. What about the second "together"?
A: Live together.
B: How do you "live together"?
A: He and Director Yang moved to the home of a worker at No. 10, 14th Street, Nanfang Workshop, to live together.
B: This is closely connecting with the masses. What else?
A: Work together, study together, meet together. Follow the production shift, and study and meet together with the workers.
B: I think the above five "togethers" are easy to do. But I think it's a bit difficult to do "enjoy entertainment together."
A: He is already participating in cultural activities.
B: How come I don't know?
A: Look in the distance.
B: No one in the distance.
A: Take a close look.
B: So you really are Secretary Wei!

　　改变作风（相声）
　　开滦林西矿党委书记　魏章
　　开滦林西矿党委组织部副部长　时言发
　　甲：现在咱们哥儿俩来给大家演一段相声。
　　乙：不对，您别这么称呼。
　　甲：怎么称呼？
　　乙：您是林西矿党委书记，我是井下的煤工，咱们是上下级。您这么称呼，我有点受不了！
　　甲：我说同志，你认错人了吧？
　　乙：啊，我认错人咧！请您站好了我再看看。（上下打量一阵）
　　甲：怎么样？认错了吧？我明明是经常和侯宝林在一起说相声的一位演员吗！
　　乙：哦，怪不的经常看您到俱乐部去。
　　甲：我告诉你吧：魏书记正在机关开紧急会议哩，他每天陷在会议里。乙：事情可够忙。
　　甲：会议一个又一个，他哪能到这里与职工们一起同娱乐呢？
　　乙：听你这么一说，魏书记敢情对职工们的文娱活动是有点不过问。
　　甲：可不吗，不但不过问，宣传部有一次召开宣传鼓动工作动员大会。
　　乙：他参加了？
　　甲：嘿嘿！他不但没去，反而把宣传部长顶回去了。
　　乙：这有点不大对劲。
　　甲：后来，这位部长又说宣传鼓动工作是一切工作的开路先锋。没有党的宣传工作，一切工作就很难做好。
　　乙：本来嘛。
　　甲：又是什么列宁说……说了一大套的理论。
　　乙：完全正确，这一来可得去了。
　　甲：还是没去。
　　乙：为什么呢？
　　甲：这位书记又说了，现在矿上产量很紧张，十几天来完不成作业计划，我哪有时间参加你们这些事情！
　　乙：好哇！党委书记不管宣传工作。
　　甲：不是不管，他没时间。
　　乙：我看不是没时间，纯粹是包办行政工作！唉，同志，请问您这是现在的事，还是过去的事呢？
　　甲：这是整风以前的情况。
　　乙：现在这位魏书记怎么样了？
　　甲：现在可不同了，由于整风大鸣大放，职工们提出批评。党组织提出了各级领导干部要做到同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同开会、同娱乐的伟大号召。
　　乙：这是改变领导作风的有效措施。
　　甲：他自己认识了自己的缺点，现在就好多了。
　　乙：有转变，就有提高。
　　甲：并且提出“六同”。
　　乙：哪“六同”？
　　甲：一同吃。
　　乙：啊，同吃怎讲？
　　甲：根据党委决定，把老宴客厅的伙食取消了。
　　乙：回家吃饭。
　　甲：有时还上大食堂，跟工友们一样，排着队买饭票。
　　乙：这是转变作风的一种。这第二同呢？
　　甲：同住。
　　乙：同住又怎么办呢？
　　甲：早就和杨矿长搬到南工房十四条十号工友家里一块住了。
　　乙：这是密切联系群众。还有呢？
　　甲：同劳动、同学习、同开会。跟班生产，上来和工友们一块学习、一块开会。
　　乙：我看上边说的这五同都好办。但是同娱乐我看有点不大容易办到。
　　甲：他现在已经参加文娱活动。
　　乙：我怎么不知道哇？
　　甲：你远看。
　　乙：远看无人。
　　甲：近瞅。
　　乙：原来您真是魏书记啊！
