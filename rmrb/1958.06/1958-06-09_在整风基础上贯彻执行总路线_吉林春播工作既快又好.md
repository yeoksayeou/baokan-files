Implementing the General Line on the Basis of Rectification: Jilin's Spring Planting Work is Both Fast and Good

    This report by our correspondent Cheng Yu analyzes Jilin Province's spring plowing and sowing work: Jilin Province's spring plowing and sowing concluded in late May. The province's dry land sowing area reached over 4,105,400 hectares, an increase of over 90,000 hectares compared to last year; paddy rice planting is proceeding intensely.

    The spring plowing and sowing conducted in conjunction with the nationwide rectification movement has more distinct characteristics than in previous years. This is primarily reflected in the earlier start and shortened duration of spring plowing and sowing. Various localities, under different conditions, adapted to local circumstances and started work half a month to twenty days earlier, planting in a timely manner. Furthermore, the cultivation time was concentrated within twenty days to a month, completed in one go, shortening the entire process by more than half a month compared to previous years. This is a major reform in the province's cultivation habits, providing extremely favorable conditions for overcoming early frost damage and ensuring a good autumn harvest. Secondly, the quality of spring plowing and sowing is very good. The amount of fertilizer applied to dry land not only increased by about onefold compared to last year, but the quality of the fertilizer also improved from a ratio of six parts soil to one part manure last year to three parts soil to one part manure. Various measures to improve seed germination rates have been widely adopted, and advanced techniques such as mixed planting, intercropping, and relay cropping have been promoted. Thirdly, the planning of spring plowing and sowing has been strengthened. In addition to completing the planting of grain and soybeans according to plan, the province's oil crop planting area has reached 57% of the plan; sugar beet planting area has reached 139% of the plan; and the province's high-yield dry land crops have also increased by 200,000 to 300,000 hectares compared to last year.

    The fact that this year's spring plowing and sowing work could be completed both quickly and well is not only due to the in-depth development of the rural rectification movement, which crushed the counterattack of landlords and rich peasants, reversed capitalist trends in rural areas such as pulling horses out of cooperatives, abandoning land, and felling trees, enabling middle peasants to firmly commit to the socialist road, and making poor peasants even more active; it is also due to the correct implementation of the general line proposed by the Party Central Committee of going all out, aiming

    在整风基础上贯彻执行总路线
    吉林春播工作既快又好
    本报讯　记者程予评述吉林省春耕播种工作：吉林省春耕播种已于5月下旬结束。全省旱田播种面积达四百一十万五千四百多公顷，较去年扩大九万多公顷；水田播种正紧张进行中。
    结合全民整风运动所进行的春耕播种，较之往年具有更加鲜明的特色。这首先表现为春耕播种的时间提前，过程缩短。各地在不同条件下，因地制宜地提前半月到二十天开始动手，适时早种。并且把耕作时间集中在二十天到一月之内，一气呵成，整个过程比往年缩短了半月以上。这是本省耕作习惯的一大改革，对战胜早霜为害，保证秋季丰收，提供了极为有利的条件。其次是春耕播种的质量很好。旱田施肥数量不仅较去年增加一倍左右，而且肥料的质量也由去年的六土一粪提高到三土一粪。普遍采用了提高种籽出芽率的各种措施，推广了混种、间种、套种等先进技术。第三是春耕播种的计划性加强。全省除粮食、大豆按计划完成播种以外，油料作物的播种面积已达到计划的57％；甜菜播种面积达到计划的139％；全省旱田高产作物也比去年增加了二、三十万公顷。
    今年春耕播种工作能够既快又好完成，不但是由于农村整风运动深入开展，打跨了地主富农的反攻，扭转了农村中拉马退社、荒废土地、砍伐林木等资本主义邪气，使中农在社会主义的道路上坚定下来，贫农则更加积极的结果；还由于正确地执行了党中央提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的结果。
    整风运动使干部作风有了显著的转变。整风以前，领导干部各把一口，在主要的工作上常常不能集中力量，深入到底。整风以后，特别在春耕播种期间，把分工和协作的矛盾统一起来，各方面的力量紧紧地拧在一起，面向农村。各级领导干部普遍开展试验田、高产田运动；并运用检查评比、组织竞赛、相互参观、现场会议等方法，把综合领导和特殊分工结合起来，中心工作和专门业务结合起来。一切统一于群众路线；一切统一于多快好省。这就不仅使春耕播种获得巨大胜利，而且使整个农村工作出现了新的局面。
    目前吉林省春苗出土良好，发育茁壮，小麦长有四五寸高。全省农村已分别进入查苗补苗，夏锄铲趟高潮，有些县份正利用农事空隙兴修水利，打下长年施工的基础。
