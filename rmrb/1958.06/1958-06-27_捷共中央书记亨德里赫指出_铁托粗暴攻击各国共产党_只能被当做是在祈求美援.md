Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 25th: At the recent 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Hendrik, delivered a speech that severely refuted the Titoist revisionist clique.

Hendrik pointed out that the talks held in Moscow on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and their results were among the most significant events in the history of the workers' class revolutionary movement. All Communist and Workers' parties around the world accepted the results of the Moscow talks and agreed with the declaration of the Communist and Workers' parties of socialist countries.

The only party that stood alone, separate from all other parties, was the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia not only refused to participate in the meetings of the parties of socialist countries but also, through its actions in the subsequent period, effectively nullified its signature on the Peace Declaration. It painstakingly put forward its own program in response to the documents of the Moscow Conference. This program can only be regarded as a thorough revisionist document. Its revisionist content has been exposed by the newspapers of our party and other Communist parties. We will continue to expose it in the future because we believe that the struggle against revisionism is essential to defeat all conspiracies of imperialism and to strengthen the unity of the international revolutionary movement.

Hendrik said that the importance of the struggle against modern revisionism is no less than the importance of the struggle led by Lenin in his time for the Bolsheviks to defeat Bernsteinism and other revisionist tendencies in the Second International. But today, Marxists-Leninists are no longer a minority facing a general plague of revisionism, but a huge army of millions opposing a small group of modern revisionists. Why have we decided to crush revisionism with the strict and irreconcilable spirit of Leninism? As the analysis of the class nature of revisionism shows, it is an ideological weapon used by the bourgeoisie to disrupt and divide the workers' class movement and to spread defeatist and wavering sentiments. Revisionists appear particularly insidiously when the revolutionary movement is in sharp conflict with the bourgeoisie, as the Hungarian incident clearly demonstrated.

Hendrik pointed out that when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other fraternal parties launched criticisms of the revisionist views of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav revisionists feigned an insulted posture, avoided responding based on factual arguments, and, on the other hand, launched indiscriminate attacks on these fraternal parties and attempted to find differences in the viewpoints and tones of the criticisms of the fraternal parties.

Hendrik said that our Congress expressed its complete agreement with the conclusions made on these issues in Comrade Novotny's report, and fully supported the principled criticisms put forward by Comrade Khrushchev at the Bulgarian Communist Party Congress. We also fully agree with the criticisms put forward at the Chinese Communist Party Congress meeting and the views expressed in the greetings from other parties to our Congress.

Next, Hendrik refuted Tito's recent speech in Labin. Hendrik said that Tito's speech was full of the most brutal attacks on various Communist parties. Tito's insults against the Chinese comrades clearly show how depraved he has become today.

This infamous speech contains a full set of similar insults taken from the arsenal of imperialist propaganda. This speech is no less than some of the most brutal speeches by representatives of reactionary imperialist groups. Such a speech will only more clearly expose the face of the leading revisionist group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Their actions prove that they have abandoned Marxism-Leninism and the entire international revolutionary movement. Tito's speech in Labin can only be regarded as an indirect request for US aid. This is the logical result of the revisionist program that the Yugoslav leaders have been forming for more than a decade.

Hendrik said that the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia clamors about the so-called "Cominform methods" in an attempt to throw a handful of sand to blind the eyes of the fraternal parties. Of course, they cannot reverse the facts of the issue. The Cominform's 1948 resolution – with which our party has always been in fundamental agreement – correctly called on the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to pay attention to the increasingly serious revisionist tendencies in its policies and wanted to help it get rid of that danger. We have already corrected some of our later inaccuracies. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other Communist parties have extended a hand of friendship to Yugoslavia and have done everything possible to promote friendly relations. Hendrik pointed out that the treacherous attitude adopted by the leaders and newspapers of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the activities carried out today by certain Yugoslav diplomats have formed a clear political line. They consciously isolate the League of Communists of Yugoslavia from the world Communist movement and isolate Yugoslavia from the socialist countries. Honest Yugoslav communists cannot agree with these actions; these actions directly violate the interests of the Yugoslav people.

Hendrik concluded by saying that Leninism's victory over Bernsteinism and the opportunism of the Second International – was the first battle in the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and it was also the first battle in the growing dominance of socialist forces in the world. Defeating modern revisionists will mean a further blow to world imperialism and will also mean that the entire international workers' class movement will make more affirmative progress.

    捷共中央书记亨德里赫指出
    铁托粗暴攻击各国共产党  只能被当做是在祈求美援
    新华社布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记亨德里赫在最近举行的捷共第十一次代表大会上的发言中，对南共修正主义集团进行了严厉的驳斥。
    亨德里赫指出，在十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候在莫斯科举行的会谈和它的结果是工人阶级革命运动史上最重大的事件之一。世界各地的所有共产党和工人党都接受了莫斯科会谈的结果，并且赞同社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言。
    唯一离开所有其他的党而独处的一个党是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟。南共领导集团不但拒绝参加社会主义国家各党的会议，而且还通过随后一个时期的行动实际上勾销了它在和平宣言上的签字。针对着莫斯科会议的文件，它煞费苦心地提出了自己的纲领。这种纲领只能认为是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义文件。它的修正主义的内容已经由我们党和其他共产党的报纸加以揭露。我们在将来也将继续加以揭露，因为我们认为反对修正主义的斗争是击败帝国主义的一切阴谋和加强国际革命运动的团结所必不可少的。
    亨德里赫说，同现代修正主义进行的斗争的重要性并不亚于列宁在他的时代所领导的布尔什维克击败伯恩斯坦主义和第二国际中的其他修正主义倾向的斗争的重要性。但是今天，马克思列宁主义者不再是面对着普遍的修正主义瘟疫的少数派了，而是由千百万人组成的一支反对一小撮现代修正主义的大军。为什么我们决定用列宁主义的严格的和不调和的精神来粉碎修正主义呢？正像对于修正主义的阶级本质的分析所表明的那样，这是资产阶级用来扰乱和分裂工人阶级运动，散布失败和动摇情绪的一个思想武器。修正主义者特别阴险地在革命运动同资产阶级发生尖锐冲突的时候出场，匈牙利事件就清楚地证明了这一点。
    亨德里赫指出，当苏联共产党、中国共产党和其他兄弟党对南共领导集团的修正主义观点展开批判时，南共修正主义者却装出一副被侮辱的姿态，避免根据实事求是的论点作出答复，而另一方面，却对这些兄弟党进行了胡乱的攻击和企图寻找各兄弟党批评的观点和语气中的差异。
    亨德里赫说，我们的代表大会表示，它完全同意诺沃提尼同志的报告中对于这些问题所作的结论，并且完全支持赫鲁晓夫同志在保加利亚共产党代表大会上提出的原则性的批评。我们也完全同意在中国共产党代表大会会议上提出的批评以及其他党对我们的代表大会的祝词中所提出的观点。
    接着，亨德里赫驳斥了铁托最近在拉宾的演说。亨德里赫说，铁托这篇演说充满了对各个共产党的最粗暴的攻击。铁托对中国同志的侮辱明显地表明他今天已经堕落到多么下流的地步。
    在这篇臭名昭彰的演说里，有着全套从帝国主义宣传武库里搬出来的类似的侮辱。这篇演说同反动帝国主义集团的代表们的一些最粗暴的演说比较起来并无逊色。这样的演说只会更加清楚地暴露南共修正主义领导集团的面目。他们的行动证明，他们已经背弃了马克思列宁主义，并且也背弃了整个国际革命运动。铁托在拉宾的演说只能被当做是间接地要求美援。这就是南斯拉夫领导人的已经形成了十多年的修正主义纲领的合乎逻辑的结果。
    亨德里赫说，南共领导集团对所谓“情报局方法”大叫大嚷，企图撒一把沙土来迷住各个兄弟党的眼睛。当然他们是无法颠倒问题的是非的。情报局1948年的决议——我们的党一直是基本上同意这个决议的——正确地要求南共注意它政策中越来越严重的修正主义倾向，并且想帮助南共摆脱那种危险。我们这方面后来的一些不正确的东西我们都已经纠正过来了。苏联共产党和其他各国共产党都向南斯拉夫伸出了友谊的手，并且尽了一切力量来增进友好关系。亨德里赫指出，南共领导者们和报纸所采取的背叛态度和南斯拉夫的某些外交人员今天进行的活动已经形成了一条明确的政治路线。他们有意识地把南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同世界共产主义运动隔离开来，把南斯拉夫同社会主义国家隔离开来。正直的南斯拉夫共产主义者是不能赞同这些行动的；这些行动直接违反了南斯拉夫人民的利益。
    亨德里赫最后说，列宁主义战胜了伯恩斯坦主义和第二国际的机会主义——这是伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的头一仗，这也是现在社会主义力量在世界上取得越来越大的优势的头一仗。战胜现代修正主义者将意味着对世界帝国主义的进一步打击，也将意味着整个国际工人阶级运动将取得更肯定的进展。
