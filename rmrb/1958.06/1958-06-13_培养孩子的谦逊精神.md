    The story of Kong Rong yielding pears at the age of three has sparked the interest of many parents. Although they don't expect their children to be as impeccably polite as Kong Rong, they do hope they can be a little more yielding. Oddly enough, the families of Xiao Ming and Xiao Lin have a set of building blocks and a doll, which no one usually likes to play with. But as soon as someone shows interest in them, they immediately fight tooth and nail, neither willing to give way. After a while, as soon as one person becomes interested in something else, everyone abandons the original toys. New conflicts arise again. Sometimes they even compete to use the chamber pot when they need to relieve themselves. The homes of Xiao Ming and Xiao Lin are thus filled with crying and quarreling all day long.
    This is the result of children's jealousy and lack of humility. If this jealousy is not corrected, it can easily lead children to develop selfish habits, planting the seeds of individualism in their young hearts. This will not only deprive them of a healthy mentality during their childhood but will also turn them into petty, narrow-minded people when they grow up.
    Poor family education is one of the most fundamental reasons for the development of jealousy in children. Some parents are excessively indulgent towards their children, and "indulgence" itself is a fertile ground for the roots of pampered behavior and jealousy. Why do Xiao Ming and Xiao Lin become jealous of each other as described above? The answer must be found in their family lives. Once, Xiao Ming had a cough. The doctor prescribed some medicine and mint-flavored throat lozenges. Xiao Ming ate a lozenge, and the coolness in his mouth made him feel good, so he cheerfully exclaimed, "Ah! This lozenge is so delicious!" Four-year-old Xiao Lin heard this and saw the joyful expression on his brother's face, and he was also envious. He curiously said, "Grandma! Give me one to try too!" The parents, hearing this, immediately said, "How can you eat medicine?" The child refused to listen and kept stomping his feet. Grandma's heart softened, and she said, "It's just a throat lozenge, made of mint, it won't hurt him to eat it. Just give him one to play with." Xiao Lin ate the lozenge even though he wasn't sick. - No, Xiao Lin was eating a throat lozenge in his mouth, but in his heart, he was planting the seeds of jealousy. Nurtured by the rain of poor family education, it will take root in Xiao Lin's mind and bear bitter fruit.
    It is very important to explain to children that different people have different needs. For example, girls need to braid their hair, so they should buy some small fabric ribbons to tie it up; if the younger brother's socks are torn, he should be bought a new pair; if the older sister's clothes are too short, she should also have a new one sewn. There is no need for other people to buy the same things. When parents buy things for their children, they should also "replenish what is lacking," and not buy new things for everyone in an egalitarian way. In this way, children can gradually recognize that they should start from actual needs, and unconsciously eliminate the factors of jealousy in children's daily lives.
    One Sunday, Lili and Lingling saw that their family was doing a big cleaning, and their parents assigned them some light work. Six-year-old Lili helped move small stools, and four-year-old Lingling took out the shoes from under the bed. They each worked enthusiastically, no longer fighting for each other's things. In the afternoon, it happened to be the time for every household to plant trees in the yard. After the adults had dug the soil, the children also helped, one covering the soil and the other watering. Consciously having children play together and do some light work together is a good way to cultivate a spirit of mutual cooperation in children, and this spirit of mutual cooperation is an important spiritual force for children to resist jealousy.

    培养孩子的谦逊精神
    王威宣
    孔融三岁让梨的故事，引起了许多家长们的兴趣。虽然他们不希望孩子像孔融那样彬彬有礼，但也十分盼望能够谦让一些。说来也奇怪，小明和小林的家里有一套积木和洋娃娃，平时谁也不爱玩。只要有谁对它们一发生了兴趣，立刻就争得面红耳热，谁也不肯让步。过了一会，只要一个人对别种东西发生了兴趣，大家又不要原来的玩具了。新的冲突又起来了。有时甚至连大小便也凑在一起，争着要用痰盂。小明和小林的家里就这样成天充满着哭闹和争执。
    这是孩子们的嫉妒心理作怪，缺乏谦让的精神的后果。这种嫉妒心理，如果不加以纠正，就容易使孩子们养成自私的恶习，幼小的心灵里种下了个人主义的幼苗。这不仅使他们在童年时代丧失了健康的心理，而且长大成人之后，也将会使他们变成气量狭窄、眼光如豆的庸人。
    不好的家庭教育是养成孩子们嫉妒心理的最根本原因之一。有的父母亲对孩子们过份迁就，而“迁就”本身就是娇气和嫉妒心理生根的沃土。小明和小林为什么像前面所说那样互相嫉妒呢？答案要从他们的家庭生活中去找。有一次，小明咳嗽了。医生给了一些药水和带有薄荷味的润喉片。小明吃了润喉片，口里一阵清凉，怪有味儿，便兴高彩烈地嚷起来：“啊！这药片真好吃！”四岁的小林听了，又看了哥哥那乐滋滋的表情，也垂涎三尺，好奇地说：“奶奶！你也给我一片尝尝吧！”父母亲在旁听了立刻说：“药，怎么给你吃呢？”孩子还不听，直跺脚。奶奶心里一软，便说：“润喉片，薄荷做的，吃了不会伤害，就给他一片吃着玩吧。”小林没有病也吃了那药片。——不，小林嘴里吃的是润喉片，而他的心灵里却播下了嫉妒心理的种子，靠着不良的家庭教育的雨水，它将会在小林的思想上生根，结出苦果。
    平时对孩子们说明不同的人应该有不同的需要，这是十分必要的。例如，女孩子要梳辫子，应该买些扎头发的小花布条；弟弟的袜子破了，应该给他买一双新的；姊姊的衣服太短了，也要缝一件新的。其他的人就没有必要买同样的东西。父母亲给孩子们买东西的时候，也应该“缺什么，补什么”，不要平均主义地都要买新的。这样，就能逐步使孩子们认识：要根据实际需要出发。无形中在日常生活中消除孩子嫉妒心理的因素。
    有一个星期日，莉莉和玲玲看见家里在大扫除，父母亲分配她们做一些轻微的工作。六岁的莉莉帮助搬小凳，四岁的玲玲拿床下的鞋子。她们各人都兴致勃勃地劳动着，谁都不再争别人的东西。下午，又适逢家家户户在院内植树，大人们把土挖好之后，孩子们也帮忙了，一个复土，一个浇水。有意识地使孩子们共同游戏和共同作些轻微的劳动，是使孩子们养成互相协作精神的好方法，而这种互相协作的精神是使孩子抵御嫉妒心理的重要精神力量。
