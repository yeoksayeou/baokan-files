Shandong Mobilizes the Entire Population to Fight Drought
Digging Water Sources from All Directions to Protect Seedlings, Harvests, and Seeds

    (Reported by the People's Daily) According to the Dazhong Daily, on May 30th, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee jointly held a radio broadcast meeting, mobilizing the people of the entire province to display their fearless heroic spirit, overcome the drought, and protect seedlings, harvests, and seeds. More than two million people across the province listened to the broadcast. More than fifty counties and cities expressed their firm response to the call, determined to wrest a good harvest from the natural disaster.

    Currently, agricultural production in Shandong Province is threatened by an extremely severe drought. Not only is the spring drought widespread, but in a considerable number of areas, there has been no thorough rain for more than two hundred days since last autumn. The average rainfall in the province for nine months is only 152 millimeters, only half of the normal rainfall for the same period. Recently, with wind and sun exposure, the drought has intensified rapidly. More than eight million mu of spring fields in the province have not yet been sown. Some of the spring seedlings that have been sown are withering due to drought, with missing seedlings and broken ridges, and some are even dying. In some places, well water has dried up, river water has dried up, and even drinking water is difficult to obtain. The severity of the drought is unprecedented in many years. Whether Shandong Province can achieve its agricultural production plan for this year depends on whether it can break through the hurdle of fighting drought and protecting seedlings.

    Zhao Jianmin, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Shandong Province, called on the entire party and all the people at the broadcast meeting to immediately take emergency action and rapidly devote themselves to the struggle against drought. He pointed out that the key to overcoming the drought at present lies in making every effort to find water sources. He said that we must have a revolutionary courage, that is, even if it does not rain, we must dig out sufficient water sources to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest. To this end, we must first seize the favorable opportunity to fight drought, make a concentrated effort in water conservancy construction, and first ensure the urgent needs of drought resistance. Secondly, we must make a concentrated effort in drought-resistant sowing and drought-resistant planting, trying every means to sow all the eight million mu of spring land that have not yet been sown as quickly as possible. In areas where the spring sowing plan has not been completed, efforts should be made to make up for it in the summer sowing. Summer sowing must be prepared early, seize the time, strive for initiative, and strive to complete the summer sowing task ahead of schedule, and promptly do a good job in the summer harvest.

    Zhao Jianmin emphasized that in the large-scale campaign to fight drought and protect seedlings, harvests, and seeds, the following measures must be highlighted: First, we must put politics in command and ideology first, and lead the vast number of cadres and masses to criticize the negative thinking of fearing difficulties and retreating and waiting for luck in the face of severe drought, and establish the positive thinking of boosting revolutionary energy, striving for advancement, and seizing a bumper harvest from nature. Second, carry forward the communist spirit, carry out large-scale cooperation, large-scale support, and large-scale mutual assistance to fight drought. Third, fully mobilize the masses to actively manufacture and improve tools, and currently, special attention should be paid to rush-making simple water lifting tools. Fourth, leading organs at all levels should quickly organize drought resistance and flood control headquarters, and the party committee secretaries should personally take command and strengthen the front line of drought resistance.

    Currently, Shandong Province is mobilizing the entire population to find water sources and fight hard against drought. The drought resistance and seedling protection campaign in Huimin and Jining prefectures has been fully launched. Farmers are digging water sources from all directions, determined to ensure a large increase in production. In Huantai County, Huimin Prefecture, all wheat has been irrigated with filling water. Boxing County completed the Xiaqing River dam project in two days, which can irrigate 80,000 mu of land. In Qufu County, Jining Prefecture, more than 9,000 mu of wheat filling water and more than 8,000 mu of spring seedlings have been irrigated. Local industry and supply and marketing departments throughout the province have also been urgently mobilized to support the drought resistance struggle.

　　山东全民抗旱大动员
    四面八方挖水源，保苗、保收、保种
    本报讯  据大众日报消息：5月30日，中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会联合举行广播大会，动员全省人民发扬大无畏的英雄气概，压倒干旱，保苗、保收、保种。全省二百多万人收听了广播。五十多个县市表示坚决响应号召，一定向自然灾害夺得丰收。
    目前，山东省农业生产受着极其严重的旱灾威胁。不仅是春旱普遍，而且有相当一部分地区从去秋以来二百多天未下透雨。全省平均降雨量九个月仅达一百五十二公厘，只及常年同期降雨量的一半。最近风吹日晒，旱情急剧发展。全省有八百余万亩春田尚未播种，已播春苗有的因旱枯萎，缺苗断垅，有的甚至枯死。有的地方井水枯、河水干，吃水都困难，干旱的严重程度为多少年来所未有。山东省能否实现今年农业生产计划，就决定于能否突破抗旱保苗这一关。
    中共山东省委书记处书记、山东省省长赵健民在广播大会上，号召全党全民立即紧急行动起来，迅速投入抗旱斗争。他指出当前战胜旱灾的关键在于千方百计地挖掘水源。他说，我们要有一股革命的勇气，就是天不下雨，也要挖掘出充分的水源来保证农业大丰收。为此，首先应抓紧抗旱有利时机，突击水利建设，首先保证抗旱急需。其次，要突击抗旱播种，抗旱点种，想尽千方百计争取尽可能快地把尚未播种的八百万亩春地全部播上种。春播未完成计划的地方，要争取在夏播中补上。夏播必须早作准备，抢时间，争主动，力争提前完成夏播任务，并及时搞好夏收工作。
    赵健民强调在大规模的抗旱保苗、保收、保种运动中，要突出地抓住以下措施：一、必须政治挂帅、思想当先，领导广大干部和群众，批判在严重旱灾面前畏难而退、侥幸等待的消极思想，树立鼓足革命干劲，力争上游，从自然手中夺取丰收的积极思想。二、发扬共产主义精神，开展大协作、大支援、大互助，来进行抗旱。三、充分发动群众积极制造和改进工具，当前尤应特别注意赶制简易提水工具。四、各级领导机关要迅速组织抗旱防汛指挥部，党委书记要亲自挂帅，加强抗旱第一线。
    现在，山东省正在全民以赴挖掘水源，苦战干旱灾害。惠民和济宁两专区的抗旱保苗运动已经全面展开。农民们四面八方挖水源，决心保证大增产。惠民专区的桓台县全部小麦已经浇了灌浆水。博兴县两天内完成小清河拦河坝工程，可浇地八万亩。济宁专区的曲阜县已浇小麦灌浆水九千多亩、春苗八千多亩。全省地方工业和供销部门也紧急动员起来支援抗旱斗争。
