    Studying Chairman Mao's Works to Solve Practical Problems
    Shanghai Workers Study and Apply Philosophy
    Qiu Xin Shipyard's Eleven Philosophy Groups Break the Mystical View of Studying Theory

    (Our Correspondent Yu Huiyin reports) Shanghai's Qiu Xin Shipyard's employees have broken the mystical view of studying theory, organized eleven philosophy groups, earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works, connecting with their thoughts, and solving many ideological and practical problems. The members of the philosophy groups mostly have a junior high school education, and two-thirds of them are workers and cadres from worker backgrounds. Some were illiterate or semi-illiterate in the early days of Liberation.

    The first philosophy group in the Qiu Xin Shipyard was established in mid-March of this year, initiated by Ma Shiting, the secretary of the Repair Workshop Party Branch, Lu Shunchang, the propaganda committee member, and Zhou Baolin, a 25-year-old fitter and member of the Communist Youth League. Zhou Baolin, who only had six years of schooling, developed an interest in philosophy early on. He read in books that the German leather worker Dietzgen, a contemporary of Marx, used his spare time to study philosophy and independently researched many philosophical problems, arriving at conclusions very close to the materialism dialectics of Marx and Engels. Dietzgen's deeds encouraged Zhou Baolin, leading him to persevere for four years, using his spare time to read more than ten philosophical books such as Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," and "Anti-Dühring." Ma Shiting and Lu Shunchang also had a strong interest and desire for theoretical study. During the rectification movement, when the three were organizing big-character posters, they often connected the problems raised by the posters and discussed issues such as phenomenon and essence, quantitative change and qualitative change, and content and form. Later, they formed a philosophy group to help each other, studying philosophy for two hours every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evening. Branch Secretary Ma Shiting served as the group leader.

    When studying Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice," they taught and learned from each other, jointly analyzing the central idea of paragraphs. Based on understanding the spirit of the documents, they connected with practical problems in their thoughts, production, and work for discussion, which greatly increased their interest in studying philosophy. The number of group members quickly increased from five to thirteen, including workers, apprentices, staff members, and even workshop directors and workshop union chairmen.

    Some workers and cadres often became very impatient when encountering problems in their work, complaining when raw materials were not supplied. During the study of "On Contradiction," through discussion, they realized that contradictions are universal. When an old contradiction is resolved, a new one will arise. The temporary inability to keep up with the supply of raw materials is an inevitable contradiction in the Great Leap Forward of production. They should actively find ways to resolve the contradiction by strengthening the purchase of raw materials and consciously saving raw materials in production.

    When discussing the role of internal and external causes, the philosophy group analyzed the situation of Cai Jichang's group in the repair workshop. Several master craftsmen in this production group looked down on each other technically, causing disunity, and the young workers were not motivated to work. Although the raw materials and collaborative parts required for production had always been available, they failed to complete their production tasks in the third and fourth quarters of last year. However, under the same material and equipment conditions, the production task in February of this year was completed at 204%, exceeding the quota by more than double. The philosophy group analyzed that this was mainly due to the education of the Great Leap Forward, which changed people's thinking, promoting mutual solidarity and cooperation within the group, and an unprecedented surge in labor enthusiasm. The members of the philosophy group understood the principle that internal causes play a decisive role and the importance of giving play to subjective initiative from the discussion.

    A long-standing ideological problem among the cadres and workers in the repair workshop was complaining that their workshop was a "garbage" site with few small tools and equipment, mostly old machines from decades ago, and a lack of attention from the leadership. After studying the issue of viewing problems from the overall perspective, many people cleared their minds and realized that the development of national construction was progressing rapidly, but national investment was limited and had to be prioritized. Their workshop was also gradually increasing new equipment, and to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, they must strive to make the old equipment play its greatest potential. Zhou Qiangeng, the chairman of the workshop union and a non-detached lathe worker, realized in his studies that looking at problems in isolation and one-sidedly is a metaphysical way of thinking. He examined his own one-sidedness in looking at problems in connection with his own thinking.

    The fact that the staff and workers of the repair workshop were studying and applying philosophy aroused the interest of the entire factory's employees and the attention of the factory leadership. At an on-site meeting, the philosophy group of the repair workshop introduced their study situation and experience. Now, the vast majority of workshops and some departments in the factory have philosophy groups mainly studying Chairman Mao's works. When a department philosophy group was studying "On Contradiction," they connected and discussed how to correctly handle the contradiction between the department and the workshops, so that the department's work could better serve production. Since the publication of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, each group has been combining the general line of socialist construction for study and discussion.

    钻研毛主席著作　解决实际问题
    上海工人学哲学用哲学
    求新造船厂十一个哲学小组破除了学习理论的神秘观点
    本报讯　记者余辉音报道：上海求新造船厂的职工打破了学习理论的神秘观点，组织了十一个哲学小组，认真钻研毛主席的著作，联系思想，解决了许多思想和实际问题。哲学小组的成员大部分只有初中的文化程度，其中三分之二是工人和工人出身的干部。有些人在解放初期还是文盲或半文盲。
    求新造船厂的第一个哲学小组是在今年3月中旬由修造车间党支部书记马仕亭、宣传委员陆顺昌和二十五岁的钳工、共青团员周宝林发起成立的。只读过六年书的周宝林很早就对哲学发生兴趣，他从书上看到，与马克思同时代的德国制革工人狄慈根利用业余时间学习哲学，独立地研究了哲学上的许多问题，得出了和马克思、恩格斯的唯物主义辩证法极其相近的结论。狄慈根的事迹鼓舞了周宝林，使他四年来坚持用业余时间读完了毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”、列宁的“哲学笔记”、“唯物论与经验批判论”、“反杜林论”等十多本哲学书。马仕亭和陆顺昌对理论学习同样具有强烈的兴趣和要求。整风运动中，三个人在一道整理大字报时，常常联系大字报提出的问题，谈到现象和本质、量变和质变、内容和形式等问题。后来，他们就成立了一个哲学小组，互相帮助，每周一、三、五晚上学习两小时哲学。支部书记马仕亭担任了小组长。
    他们在学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”等著作时，互教互学，共同分析段落中心大意。在体会文件精神的基础上，联系思想、生产、工作中的实际问题进行讨论，这样，学习哲学的兴趣很大，小组成员很快由五人增加到十三人，其中有工人、学徒、职员，还有车间主任、车间工会主席。
    有些工人和干部在工作中遇到一些问题往往非常急躁，看到原材料供应不上就抱怨起来。在“矛盾论”的学习中，经过讨论他们认识到矛盾是普遍存在的，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾就会产生，原材料供应一时跟不上，正是生产大跃进中必然出现的矛盾，应积极想办法，加强原材料的采购、在生产中更加自觉地节约原材料等方面来解决矛盾。
    在讨论内因和外因的作用时，哲学小组联系修造车间里的蔡吉昌小组的情况作了分析。这个生产小组里的几个老师傅在技术上互相看不起，闹不团结，青年工人干活也没劲，虽然生产上所需要的原材料和协作件一直都跟得上，去年第三、四季度却一直完不成生产任务。在材料设备都没有改变的情况下，今年2月份的生产任务却完成了204％，超额一倍多。哲学小组分析研究这主要是工人们经过大跃进形势的教育，人的思想起了变化，小组内互相团结合作，劳动热情空前高涨的缘故。哲学小组的成员们从讨论中懂得了内因起决定性作用的道理和发挥主观能动性的重要。
    修造车间的干部和工人中长期存在的一个思想问题是抱怨自己车间是个“垃圾”场地，小工具设备少，机器大都是几十年前的旧货，领导上不重视。学习了用全局观点看问题后，很多人思想通了，认识到国家建设的发展一日千里，而国家投资有限，必须分轻重缓急。自己的车间也在逐步增加新设备，要多快好省地建设社会主义，一定要努力使旧设备发挥最大的潜力。这个车间的工会主席周强赓是个不脱产的车床工人，他在学习中认识到孤立地片面地看问题是形而上学的思想方法，他联系自己的思想检查了看问题的片面性。
    修造车间职工们学哲学、用哲学的事，引起了全厂职工的兴趣和工厂领导的重视。在现场会议上由修造车间哲学小组介绍学习情况和经验。现在全厂绝大多数车间和一些科室都有了学习毛主席著作为主的哲学小组，一个科室哲学小组在学习“矛盾论”时，联系讨论如何正确处理科室和车间的矛盾，使科室工作更好地为生产服务。自从中共八大二次会议的文件发表以后，各小组已在结合社会主义建设总路线进行学习和讨论。
