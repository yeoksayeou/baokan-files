Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: The youth experiment group of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Minji Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, harvested a total of 2,408 jin and 11 liang of rapeseed from their 2.1 mu experimental plot. The average yield reached 1,146 jin, 15 liang, and 9 qian per mu, surpassing the high-yield record of 806 jin per mu previously set by Zeng Kaicai, a labor model from Yingcheng County.

	This rapeseed experimental plot, located on sandy soil, was cultivated by Zou Gongfa, the secretary of the cooperative's Communist Youth League branch and leader of the youth experiment group, along with three other League members. Before sowing, the land was plowed twice, harrowed twice, and tilled twice, with base fertilizer applied in layers. The rapeseed in this plot has grown exceptionally well, averaging five chi in height, with 55,000 plants per mu, each plant bearing 1,600 pods, and each pod containing approximately 22 to 30 rapeseed grains.

	Zhao Jinliang, the Secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee, and Cha Guoliang, the Secretary of the Minji Township branch, participated in the acceptance inspection of this rapeseed plot. Zou Gongfa and the young people are now summarizing their high-yield rapeseed experience, striving to achieve even higher yields next year.

    油菜籽跃过千斤大关
    麻城县出现亩产1146斤的最高纪录
    新华社武汉19日电　湖北省麻城县闵集乡第一农业社青年试验组的两亩一分油菜地，总产量达到了二千四百零八斤十一两，平均亩产一千一百四十六斤十五两九钱，超过了应城县劳动模范曾开采创造的亩产八百零六斤的丰产纪录。
    这块油沙土质的油菜试验地，是社共青团支部书记、青年试验组组长邹公发和三个团员一道培育的，播种前曾经两犁两耙两耕，还分层施了底肥。这块地的油菜一直长得特别好，平均长有五尺高，每亩有五万五千株，每株结荚一千六百个，每个荚子里约有二十二到三十粒菜籽。
    中共麻城县委书记赵金良和闵集乡支部书记查国良等，都参加了这块油菜地的验收。邹公发和青年们现在正总结油菜丰产经验，争取明年获得更高的产量。
