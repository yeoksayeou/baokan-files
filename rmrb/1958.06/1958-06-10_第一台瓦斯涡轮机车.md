　　The First Gas Turbine Locomotive
    The Lenin Factory in Pilsen has built Czechoslovakia's first gas turbine locomotive. This locomotive has successfully passed initial operational tests.
    A portion of Czechoslovakia's railway lines, due to geographical limitations, are difficult to electrify, and steam locomotives are unable to cope with the increasingly heavy transportation tasks. In this situation, the question of manufacturing gas turbine locomotives was raised.
    The new type of locomotive newly trial-produced by the Lenin Factory has operational performance comparable to that of electric locomotives. In addition, it uses low-grade diesel and heavy oil as fuel, which are by-products obtained during the refining of natural petroleum and the production of synthetic gasoline, making it more economical. Furthermore, the gas turbine locomotive does not require water during operation, which is also a great advantage.
    The maximum speed of the gas turbine locomotive when transporting goods is 80 kilometers per hour, and the maximum speed when towing express passenger cars is 125 kilometers per hour. The operation of the locomotive is fully automated, requiring only one driver to operate it. (Attached picture)

　　第一台瓦斯涡轮机车
    比尔森的列宁工厂造成了捷克斯洛伐克第一台瓦斯涡轮机车。这台机车已经顺利地通过了初步操作试验。
    捷克斯洛伐克的一部分铁路线，由于地理条件的限制，难以实现电气化，而蒸汽机车又无法胜任面临的越来越繁重的运输任务。在这种情况下就提出了制造瓦斯涡轮机车的问题。
    列宁工厂新试制成功的这种新型机车，运行性能足可以同电气机车媲美。此外，它用低级柴油和重油作为燃料，而这两种燃料是在提炼天然石油和生产合成汽油时得到的副产品，比较经济。再看，瓦斯涡轮机车在运行时不需要水，这也是个大优点。
    瓦斯涡轮机车运货时的最高时速为八十公里，拖带快速客车时的最高时速为一百二十五公里。驾驶机车的工作完全是自动化的，只需要一名司机操作。（附图片）
