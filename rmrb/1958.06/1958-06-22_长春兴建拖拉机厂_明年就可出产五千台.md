Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, June 21st. Construction of the Changchun Tractor Manufacturing Plant began on the 20th. This modern factory, capable of producing 7,000 to 10,000 tractors annually, is being built by Jilin Province with state support and by fully relying on local resources, to promote the early realization of agricultural mechanization throughout the province.

Jilin Province has a vast territory but a sparse population, and both labor and animal power are insufficient. Agricultural development urgently requires tractors. The Changchun Tractor Factory will produce new-style medium-sized tractors with 24 to 30 horsepower, suitable for the soil conditions of Jilin Province. They can be used for plowing, sowing, and transportation, as well as for driving various agricultural processing machines.

The construction of the Changchun Tractor Manufacturing Plant has benefited from the cooperation of the state-owned Jilin Diesel Engine Factory. It will be expanded on the basis of the diesel engine factory, while also building other workshops needed to manufacture tractors. In this way, the existing equipment and manpower of the diesel engine factory can be fully utilized, saving about two-thirds of the investment. It can be completed in the first quarter of next year, and it is expected to produce about 5,000 tractors next year.

    长春兴建拖拉机厂
    明年就可出产五千台
    据新华社长春21日电  长春拖拉机制造厂20日动工兴建。这座能年产七千到一万台拖拉机的近代化工厂，是吉林省在国家支援下，充分依靠地方力量，为促进全省农业机械化的提前实现而兴建的。
    吉林省地广人稀，劳动力和畜力都感不足，农业发展十分需要拖拉机。长春拖拉机厂出产的将是二十四到三十马力的新式中型拖拉机，它适合于吉林省的土质条件，可以用来耕地、播种、运输，也可以用来带动各种农业加工机器。
    长春拖拉机制造厂的建设，取得了国营吉林柴油机厂的协作。它将在柴油机厂的基础上进行扩建，同时兴建制造拖拉机所需要的其他车间。这样，可以充分利用柴油机厂已有的设备和人力，投资可以节省三分之二左右。明年第一季度可以建成，预定明年就可以出产拖拉机五千台左右。
