Our party, our country, now needs a large number of people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, people who dare to break superstitions, innovate and create, and people who dare to adhere to the truth, charge for the truth, and establish advanced and revolutionary banners. Relying on such people, we can lead the people of the whole country to leap forward again and again, and complete the great cause of socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way.
