To promote the progress of practical work through inspection and appraisal has become a common leadership method for cadres at all levels in Jiujiang Special District, Jiangxi Province. In the inspection and appraisal, they tightly grasp both the advanced and the backward, driving the intermediate forward, so that the broad masses constantly maintain a vigorous revolutionary drive.

Currently, inspection and appraisal in Jiujiang Special District have formed a mass movement. There are regular inspections and appraisals between counties, districts, and townships, and even more frequent inspections and appraisals between communes, teams, and individuals. In addition, the grassroots party organizations in many townships and communes have also established inspection and appraisal systems. The forms of appraisal are also more diverse and novel than in the past. For example, Nieqiao District in Dean County has universally established a "Registration Book for Appraisal and Competition Results," which records the results of each appraisal in detail; there is also a chart called "People Strive to Go Higher," with red, white, and green flags inserted to represent good, medium, and poor types. Jiujiang County generally adopted the forms of allegro and big-character posters to carry out praise and criticism. The Yu Lin Commune's No. 19 Team in Yuhe Township of this county did a good job in raising seedlings in warm beds, and the masses sent them an allegro: "Team 19 does a good job of raising seedlings in warm beds, with specialized management in place. A shed is built by the field, to watch out for wild beasts at night and birds during the day. Standards and quality are all good, and the temperature is also well maintained." The number of words is not many, but it pointed out the reasons for the good work in raising seedlings in warm beds.

In the Great Leap Forward in production, the advanced and the backward are constantly changing. In practice, party committees at all levels recognized and grasped this law, and constantly organized inspections and appraisals to promote the movement to advance again and again. Generally speaking, county-wide inspections and appraisals are carried out every two to three months, district and township inspections are carried out about every two months, communes compete and are appraised monthly, and teams are even more frequent. In addition, regular inspections and appraisals are held throughout the special district. The content of each inspection and appraisal is arranged in advance to further promote the progress of practical work. For example, the content of the second inspection and appraisal in Hao Shan District, Pengze County, was: "Every plot has fertilizer, eliminate 'unsanitary fields'," which prompted the manure accumulation movement to move from a high tide to a higher tide. In a very short period of time, the average application of fertilizer per mu in the district increased from 115 dan to 297 dan.

In the inspection and appraisal, leading cadres at all levels swept away the past style of "skimming the surface". In addition to listening to reports, they also widely contacted the masses through on-site visits, field labor, and small-scale discussions, generally achieving "seeing the events, seeing the objects, and seeing the people." They did not simply accuse some backward units, but warmly helped them. Therefore, the masses called the appraisal and visiting groups "advisory groups," "promotion groups," and "guidance groups"... For example, Duchang and other counties adopted the method of "sitting down and igniting three fires" to help backward units quickly change their backwardness. "Sitting down" meant: sitting in the backward units, and not leaving until the backwardness was changed. "Igniting three fires" meant: spreading model deeds to ignite the fire of overcoming difficulties; organizing visits to the advanced to ignite the fire of burning conservative thoughts; and organizing competitions to ignite the fire of catching up with the advanced.

After the baptism of the rectification movement, the atmosphere of "mutual learning and common leap forward" prevailed greatly. In the inspection and appraisal, many advanced units were willing to introduce their advanced experience, while backward units also humbly learned from the strengths of others. Many units also signed appraisal contracts, learning from each other and promoting each other. Due to the continuous inspection and appraisal, the masses constantly maintained a soaring revolutionary drive, and the production movement was in full swing.

    促使群众经常保持旺盛的革命干劲
    九江专区广泛开展评比工作
    本报讯　记者徐长荣报道：通过检查评比推动实际工作的进展，已成为江西省九江专区的各级干部普遍的领导方法。在检查和评比中，紧紧地抓住两头、带动中间，使广大群众经常保持着旺盛的革命干劲。
    目前，九江专区的检查评比已形成群众性的运动。县与县、区与区、乡与乡之间，有定期的检查评比，社与社、队与队、人与人之间的检查评比更为经常。另外，许多乡和社党的基层组织也建立了检查评比制度。评比的形式，也比过去多样新颖。比如，德安县聂桥区普遍建立了“评比竞赛结果登记簿”，详细记载每次评比结果；还设有“人往高处走”的图表，表上插着红、白、绿三种旗子，以表示好、中、差三种类型。九江县普遍采取了快板和大字报的形式，进行表扬和批评。这个县的余河乡雨淋社第十九队温床育苗做得好，群众就送给他们一首快板：“十九队温床育苗做得好，专人管理作到了。田边搭了一个棚，晚看野兽日看鸟。标准质量都可以，说起温度也还好。”字数不多，但一针见血地说出了温床育苗作得好的原因。
    在生产大跃进中，先进和落后不断变化着。实践中，各级党委认识到这一规律，并掌握了这一规律，不断组织检查和评比，推动运动前进再前进。一般说来，全县范围的检查评比，二个月到三个月进行一次，区和乡两个月左右进行一次，社与社月月竞赛月月评比，队与队就更为频繁。另外，还定期举行全专区范围内的检查评比。每次的检查评比内容，都事先布置，进一步推动实际工作的进展。如彭泽县浩山区第二次检查评比的内容是：丘丘有肥料，消灭“卫生田”，这就促使积肥运动由高潮走向更高潮。在很短的时间内，全区便由每亩施肥平均一百一十五担增加到二百九十七担。
    在检查评比中，各级领导干部一扫过去“蜻蜓点水”的作风，除了听取汇报以外，并通过现场参观，田间劳动、小型座谈等方式，广泛地和群众接触，一般都作到了“见事，见物，又见人”。对一些后进单位，不是单纯的指责，而是热情的帮助。因此，群众把评比参观团叫做“顾问团”、“促进团”、“辅导团”……。比如，都昌等县采取了“一坐三点火”的办法，帮助后进单位迅速改变落后面貌。一坐是：坐镇落后单位，不改变落后面貌不走。三点火是：传播模范事迹，点起克服困难之火；组织参观先进，点起燃烧保守思想之火；组织竞赛，点起追赶先进之火。
    经过整风运动的洗礼，“相互学习，共同跃进”之风，大为盛行。在检查评比中，很多先进单位都愿意把自己的先进经验介绍出来，而落后单位也虚心学习别人的长处。许多单位还签订了评比合同，相互学习，相互推动。由于检查和评比不断进行，群众经常保持着冲天的革命干劲，生产运动搞得热火朝天。
