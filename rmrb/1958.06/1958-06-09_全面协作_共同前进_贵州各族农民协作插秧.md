    Comprehensive Collaboration, Joint Progress
    Farmers of All Ethnic Groups in Guizhou Collaborate on Rice Transplanting
    (Our Dispatch) In the current intense drought resistance and rice transplanting efforts, farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province are extensively carrying out socialist large-scale collaboration. As of June 3rd, the province had transplanted over 14.4 million mu, accounting for 38% of the plan. Generally, this is about half a month faster than the same period last year, and the quality surpasses any year in history. Triangular cluster planting and strip dense planting reached 91%.
    In the mountainous Guizhou Plateau, difficulties that many townships and communes could not solve in the past often affected timely and full planting during the rice transplanting season. This year, after the all-people rectification campaign, farmers of all ethnic groups not only love the country, the commune, and labor even more, but also the relations between communes and communes, teams and teams, and people and people are developing in the direction of communism. In the current rice transplanting, they are comprehensively collaborating and advancing together.
    In the past month, the main characteristics of the large-scale rice transplanting collaboration in various places have been: agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas with a later planting season dispatching members to support rice transplanting in drought-stricken areas in the plains; farmers in the plains helping agricultural cooperatives in the mountains solve the problems of insufficient seedlings and technical personnel. Jinsha County has not had a thorough rain for more than three months this year, and many areas have no water for rice transplanting. In May, 52 townships in the county with more land than fields and less severe drought organized more than 50,000 people and more than 1,300 head of cattle to support more than 200 cooperatives in 31 townships with more fields than land and more severe drought. Five high-mountain townships, including Huilong and Changba, transferred 5,000 people at once to support the Bajiao, Dadi and other townships at the foot of the mountain, and from May 16th to 22nd, they assisted in seizing water to plow 5,000 mu of dry land and plant rice seedlings.
    In organizing large-scale collaboration, all localities have always strengthened political and ideological leadership. At the beginning of the collaboration, a few cooperatives and teams with better conditions had an unclear understanding of the collaboration, so they felt that it didn't matter whether they supported or not, and were afraid that others would take advantage of them. Party organizations in various places seized these ideological problems, launched mass debates, and educated commune members to overcome all kinds of departmentalism. (Liu Yangshen)

### 全面协作　共同前进  贵州各族农民协作插秧

    全面协作　共同前进
    贵州各族农民协作插秧
    本报讯　贵州省各族农民在当前紧张的抗旱栽秧中，广泛开展社会主义的大协作，到6月3日止，全省已栽一千四百多万亩，占计划38％，一般比去年同期快半月左右，而且质量胜过历史上任何一年，三角丛植和条播密植达到91％。
    在多山的贵州高原上，过去在栽秧期间，往往由于许多一乡一社不能解决的困难，影响及时满栽满插。今年各族农民经过全民整风，不仅更加爱国爱社、爱劳动，而且社与社、队与队、人与人之间的关系也在朝着共产主义方向发展，在当前的栽秧中，全面协作，共同前进。
    近一个月来，各地栽秧大协作的主要特点是：生产季节较迟的山区农业社，派出社员支援平坝受旱地区栽秧；平坝农民帮助山上农业社解决秧苗和技术力量不足的问题。金沙县今年三个多月没下透雨，不少地区无水栽秧。在5月份，这个县有五十二个土多田少、受旱不重的乡，组织五万多人、一千三百多头耕牛支援田多土少受旱较重的三十一个乡的二百多个社。回龙、场坝等五个高山乡，一次就调出五千人支援山下的八角、大地等乡，在5月16日到22日，协助抢水把五千亩干田犁好，栽上秧苗。
    在组织大协作中，各地始终加强了政治思想领导。在开始组织协作时，有少数条件好的社和队，对协作认识不清，因而感到支援不支援没关系，怕别人沾他们的光。各地党组织便抓住这些思想问题，展开群众性辩论，教育社员克服了形形色色的本位主义思想。（刘扬深）
