How I Learned Philosophy?
Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard Worker Lu Shunchang

During the rectification movement, some rightists in our Qiuxin Shipyard used philosophical terms to attack the Party. During the anti-rightist struggle, some comrades theoretically analyzed and refuted some of the rightists' fallacies. I was a member of the rectification leading group. I knew very well that the rightists' fallacies were attacks against the Party, but because I lacked the theoretical grounding, I could not analyze and refute them theoretically. From that time on, I had the desire to learn philosophy. At the same time, I often worked with Zhou Baolin, a fitter, who had studied philosophy. Sometimes, when we encountered problems at work, we would talk about philosophical issues such as content and form, basis and conditions, quantitative change and qualitative change. I found it very interesting.

Through the rectification movement, the ideological awareness of the worker comrades was greatly improved. They often discussed philosophical issues on the construction site. When they didn't understand something, they always said to ask Lu Shunchang, the propaganda committee member of the branch. However, I didn't know anything about these issues and found it difficult to answer them. Under these circumstances, my desire to learn philosophy became even more urgent. So I bought some philosophical pamphlets, wanting to learn some philosophical terms to answer the questions people raised. In March of this year, Ma Shiting, the secretary of the workshop Party branch, and Zhou Baolin talked about learning philosophy, and we initiated the establishment of a philosophy group. Once, I read Lenin's "The State," and finished it in just over half an hour. I could understand the words, but I couldn't answer a few simple questions that others asked, such as what is the state, and how did the state originate. Later, I adopted a word-by-word approach to reading theoretical books, first figuring out some of the terms I encountered frequently. In this way, I unconsciously got stuck in a dead end. For example, I spent several days just trying to understand the term "metaphysics" without fully grasping it, which led me to believe that philosophy was difficult to learn.

In the early stages of our philosophy group's study, we also only focused on learning from nouns and concepts, and our study performance was relatively poor. Later, we combined the current practical problems to study Chairman Mao's works, and then we felt that philosophy was not difficult to learn. For example, when studying the first chapter of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which deals with two types of contradictions with different natures, we analyzed why some people become rightists. The rightists in our workshop often said that they were influenced by the rightist remarks in society and became echoers of the rightists. Through study, I realized that the reason why some people become rightists is determined by their class roots and consistent anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds. The rightist remarks in society are only the conditions that prompt the exposure of their essence. From this, I realized that the rightists are determined by themselves (internal cause), and some fallacies in society (external cause) are only conditions. Through such examples, I understood that external causes are the conditions for change, and internal causes are the basis for change, and the principle that external causes act through internal causes became easy to understand. I also used these principles to analyze the reasons why our workshop failed to complete its task in May. I used to think that the main reason was that the forgings and castings (external causes) from other workshops were not supplied in time and the labor force was unbalanced, which affected the completion of the task. Our workshop (internal cause) could not solve this problem, so the external cause was the main one. However, the main contradiction of our workshop's lathe section in May was also the insufficient supply of forgings and castings, which affected the completion of the section's task. But through the active measures taken by all the comrades in the section and the section chief, and by giving play to subjective initiative, the work that could not be processed in May was brought forward to May to make up for the difficulty of insufficient supply of forgings and castings. As a result, the task was overfulfilled by 6% in May. This fact proves that my past analysis and understanding of the problem were not comprehensive enough. I only saw the difficulties and did not recognize the role of people's subjective initiative.

The reason why our philosophy group has such a high enthusiasm for learning is mainly because we link some theoretical issues in philosophy with the current practical situation, the current work, and the problems existing in our thinking for analysis and research, so learning is not difficult.

In my study, I especially feel that Chairman Mao's works are permeated with many philosophical principles, explaining the problems in a simple and easy-to-understand way, which is especially suitable for our study. I feel that if you want to learn philosophy well, you must first study Chairman Mao's works.

Through studying philosophy, I have greatly improved in analyzing and solving problems. In the past, I rarely used persuasive education methods with comrades. Now I begin to pay attention to calmly thinking about other people's problems and opinions. If they can be solved, I will do it immediately. In this way, my relationship with the masses has also improved.

    我是怎样学哲学的？
    上海求新造船厂工人　陆顺昌
    在整风运动中，我们求新造船厂有些右派分子搬用哲学名词向党进攻，反右派时，有些同志对右派分子的一些谬论从理论上给予分析和驳斥。我是整风领导小组成员之一，我也明明知道右派的谬论是向党进攻的，但是由于没有本钱，因此不能从理论上分析驳斥。从这时起，我就产生了学习哲学的愿望。同时，我和钳工周宝林常在一起工作，他是学过哲学的，有时在工作上遇到一些问题，我们两人就扯到内容与形式、根据与条件、量变与质量等哲学问题，谈起来我感到很有兴趣。
    通过整风运动，工人同志的思想觉悟都大大提高，在工地上有时也常谈论一些哲学问题，有不懂的问题，他们总是说问问支部宣传委员陆顺昌。但是，我对这些问题却一窍不通，很难回答。在这样的情况下，我学习哲学的要求更加迫切了。于是我就买了一些哲学小册子，想学一些哲学名词，好解答人们提出的问题。今年3月份，车间党支部书记马仕亭和周宝林两人谈起学习哲学的事情，我们就发起成立了一个哲学小组。有一次我看列宁著的论“国家”，只花半个多小时就看完了，文字都能看懂，但是对于别人提出的几个简单问题，例如什么是国家，国家是怎样产生的，我就答不出来。以后我看理论书籍就采取一字一句的办法，先把一些经常遇到的名词弄通，这样无形中钻入了牛角尖，例如单是为了形而上学的名词就看了好些书，花了几天时间也没有全部学懂，这样就产生了哲学很难学的看法。
    在我们哲学小组学习初期也是只从名词概念上来学习，学习成绩是比较差的。以后我们结合当前的实际问题学习毛主席的著作，这样就感到哲学也并不难学。例如在学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”第一章两类不同性质的矛盾时，我们分析了有些人为什么会成为右派分子？我们车间的右派分子经常说他是受了社会上右派言论的影响而成为右派的应声虫的。通过学习，我认识到有些人所以成为右派，是由他的阶级根源和一贯反党反人民反社会主义的言行决定的，社会上的右派言论只是促使他本质暴露的条件。由此我认识到右派是由它本身（内因）所决定的，社会上的一些谬论（外因）只是条件。通过这样的例子，我知道了外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因作用的道理就很容易理会了。又用这些原理来分析我们车间5月份完不成任务的原因，我曾经认为主要原因是外车间锻铸件（外因）没有供应得上和劳动力不平衡，以致影响了任务的完成，本车间（内因）这是无法解决的，所以外因是主要的。但是我们车间车床工段5月份的主要矛盾也是锻铸件供应不上，影响工段任务的完成，但经全工段同志和工段长积极采取措施，发挥了主观能动性，把5月份原先不能加工的工作提前到5月份加工，弥补了锻铸件供应不上的困难，结果5月份超额6％完成了任务。从这一事实证明，我过去对问题的分析和认识是不够全面的，只看到困难，没有认识到人的主观能动性的作用。
    我们哲学小组学习情绪所以这样高，主要是因为我们把哲学上的一些理论问题和当前的实际情况、当前工作、思想中存在的问题联系起来进行分析研究，所以学习并不困难。
    在学习中，我特别感到毛主席的著作贯穿着许多哲学的原理，深入浅出的说明问题，特别适合我们学习。我感到要想学好哲学就必须首先学习毛主席的著作。
    通过学习哲学，我在分析解决问题上有了很大提高。过去我对同志很少用说服教育的方法，现在开始注意对别人的问题和意见沉着地加以思考，可以解决的就马上去作，这样我和群众的关系也变好了。
