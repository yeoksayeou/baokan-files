Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 4th - The Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the domestic political situation, titled: "A New Stage in the Struggle for the Republic."

The Political Bureau pointed out that "the seriousness of the situation created by the formation of the De Gaulle government should not be ignored" because "De Gaulle possesses all the levers of the state, and is surrounded by ministers who are completely subservient to him, thus posing a serious threat to the republican system and the rights of the working people."

The statement said that the De Gaulle government "is an obstacle to a peaceful solution to the Algerian problem."

The Central Committee of the French Communist Party called on "all anti-fascists to establish thousands upon thousands of new Committees for the Defense of the Republic in enterprises, cities, and villages through democratic elections, in order to expand and strengthen their unity."

The statement also called on local party organizations of the French Communist Party to establish new grassroots party organizations in enterprises, urban districts, and villages, and welcomed all working people who agree with the party's policies and have already participated in action to join the Communist Party.

The statement announced that the Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party has decided to hold a plenary session of the Central Committee on June 9th and 10th "to study the current situation and the great tasks facing the party, the working class, and the French people in this situation."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Paris on the 4th, according to De Gaulle's "request," the Speaker of the French National Assembly, Le Troquer, announced on the afternoon of the 3rd that the National Assembly would adjourn until the beginning of October. However, the Communist Party parliamentary group issued a communiqué on the evening of the 3rd stating that during the National Assembly's recess, Communist Party deputies would continue to meet every two weeks.

The communiqué emphasized that no matter what happens, Communist Party deputies will continue to serve the French people.

Earlier on the 3rd, De Gaulle received Salan, the commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria and one of the leaders of the military rebellion in Algeria, and held talks with him. Salan flew to Paris from Algiers at De Gaulle's invitation. On the 4th, De Gaulle himself went to Algeria for a "visit."

At the cabinet meeting chaired by De Gaulle on the afternoon of the 3rd, Ély was reappointed as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. It is known that Ély was the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces in the previous cabinet, and he resigned from this position three days after the fascists in Algiers launched a rebellion.
