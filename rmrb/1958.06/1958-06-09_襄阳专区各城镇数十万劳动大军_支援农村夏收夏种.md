Over 400,000 urban residents throughout the prefecture have gone to the countryside to participate in the harvesting and planting activities.

In Zhuxi County, more than 50,000 cadres from government offices, teachers, students, and residents went to the countryside to provide support, bringing their own rain gear and sickles. In Sui County, all agencies and enterprises generally adopted the method of having the Party Secretary take the lead and cadres lead the way, organizing support teams separately and putting forward the slogan of "working conscientiously and maintaining close ties with the masses." Under the slogan of "Everyone goes into battle, teachers and students mobilize together," Xiangyang County No. 5 Middle School brought nearly 900 pieces of tools such as sickles and hoes to the countryside to provide support, and decided to be responsible for reaping, threshing, warehousing, stubble clearing, and seedling raising. Employees of financial and trade departments in various places strengthened supply work, delivered goods to the countryside, and also participated in summer harvesting and planting activities. They produced during the day and conducted business at night, which was very popular with the masses.
