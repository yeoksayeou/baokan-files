Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 26th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Council of Ministers issued a communique on June 25th regarding a Council of Ministers meeting held in mid-June. The meeting was presided over by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.

The communique stated that after listening to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the world situation, the Council of Ministers discussed issues such as the struggle to defend peace and strive for the convening of a summit conference, the situation in France, the situation in Indonesia, the situation in Lebanon, and the situation in Yugoslavia.

The communique stated that the Central Land Reform Committee gave a report on the basic completion of land reform and the rectification of errors in organizational consolidation. The Council of Ministers believes that after more than a year of effort, the rectification work has been basically completed, with good results, basically meeting the requirements. Because the rectification work was done well, this has consolidated and expanded the achievements of land reform, stabilized the situation in rural areas, vigorously promoted production, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and created conditions for the northern rural areas to embark on the road of cooperativization and gradually transition to socialism. The good results obtained from the rectification work fully demonstrate that the policies and propositions of the Party Central Committee and the government are correct.

The communique stated that the Council of Ministers emphasized the need to mobilize and educate workers, peasants, and cadres to actively launch a production competition that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and to overfulfill the first year's plan of the Three-Year Plan.

The communique stated that the Council of Ministers instructed the relevant ministries to study and take all necessary measures in a timely manner to promote work in all aspects, especially in promoting grain production, industrial production, and capital construction.

The communique stated that the Council of Ministers decided to vigorously promote the competition to "resolve to strive for a bumper late rice harvest." This year's late rice production must be a victorious late rice production that exceeds the plan, to ensure that the planned annual total harvest output target is achieved. The Council of Ministers believes that we have sufficient strength to do this.

The Council of Ministers pointed out that on the basis of educating and mobilizing the entire people to recognize the great significance of this year's late rice production, governments at all levels and all departments must closely integrate the vigorous promotion of the "resolve to strive for a bumper late rice harvest" competition with the promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Council of Ministers pointed out to the relevant ministries and local governments that they must do a good job in agricultural tax collection and purchasing work; they must resolutely oppose the distorted arguments and illegal actions of speculators and saboteurs. It is necessary to deeply mobilize the people and explain to them so that everyone recognizes the importance of the food issue and is determined to vigorously promote late rice production, to contribute to stabilizing prices and ensuring the people's livelihood.

    公报说，部长会议决定大力推进“决心争取晚造丰收”的竞赛。今年的晚造生产必须是一个胜利的超过计划的晚造生产，以保证达到计划所规定的全年收获总产量的指标。部长会议认为，我们是有足够的力量作到这点的。
    部长会议指出，在教育和动员全民认清今年晚造生产的重大意义的基础上，各级政权和各部门必须把大力推进“决心争取晚造丰收”的竞赛和推进变工合作运动紧密地结合起来。部长会议向有关各部和地方政权指出，必须做好农业税收工作和收购工作；必须坚决反对投机倒把分子及破坏分子的歪曲事实的论调和非法行动。必须深入地动员人民，并且进行解释，使每个人都认清粮食问题的重要性，决心大力推进晚造生产，为稳定物价和保障人民的生活作出贡献。
