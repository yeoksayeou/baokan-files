Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. The Southern Region Agricultural Irrigation Conference, which closed here on the 5th, proposed the grand task of striving for basic water conservancy in the southern region through hard work this winter and spring, and initially drafted various planned targets for achieving the above task.

This conference was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture. During the conference, the representatives from various regions spent most of their time visiting the water conservancy construction in the Xiangyang Special Zone, exchanging important experiences from various regions in large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, and conscientiously reviewed past work in accordance with the spirit of the general line of socialist construction.

The meeting held that since last winter, the southern regions, like the rest of the country, based on the nationwide rectification movement and in the tide of the great leap forward in the comprehensive development of industry and agriculture, agricultural irrigation construction has taken the lead and achieved unprecedented great achievements. According to incomplete statistics from the provinces (autonomous regions) and cities participating in the conference, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 130 million mu during this period. In many provinces and cities, the irrigated area has reached more than 70%-80% of the existing cultivated land area; in addition, the irrigated area has been improved by more than 120 million mu, flood and waterlogging prevention has been completed in an area of 100 million mu, the initial area of soil and water conservation control is more than 53,000 square kilometers, and the management of medium and small rivers and the planning and construction of rural hydropower stations have been actively carried out. All these have begun and are continuously playing a significant role in ensuring the great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

The meeting held that during this period, various regions have gained rich experience in building agricultural irrigation, among which the most important are: It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over water conservancy work, and under the premise of putting politics in command, achieve the combination of politics and technology, the combination of leadership and the masses, and give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the masses; it is necessary to resolutely implement the water conservancy construction policy of "storing water as the main task, small-scale as the main task, and community-run as the main task," and on this basis combine necessary drainage projects, large and medium-sized projects, and projects run by the state; it is necessary to strengthen and expand communist cooperation between communities, between townships, between counties, and between provinces; it is necessary to break superstitions, liberate thinking, boldly innovate, boldly create, and continuously improve labor efficiency and project quality; in addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the management of water conservancy irrigation, achieve water conservation, rational water use, and improve water utilization. Everyone agreed that the Xiangyang Special Zone has better experience in the above aspects. The special zone's method of using "drawing water from afar, irrigating fields nearby, opening canals on mountains, connecting canals and weirs, irrigating weirs in slack times, and irrigating fields in busy times" to establish a watermelon seedling-style gravity irrigation network is a creative measure, which has found a direction for large-scale water conservancy construction in mountainous and hilly areas in the future, and it is recommended that various regions vigorously promote it. The meeting held that the "three reforms" experience of Nanping Special Zone in Fujian Province in improving irrigation methods, improving rotten mud fields, and improving cold water fields is also very good, and it is recommended that various regions organize promotion according to local conditions.

The participants studied and discussed the relevant documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (Second Session), and in accordance with the spirit of the documents, reviewed the shortcomings and lessons that have appeared in water conservancy construction over the past few years, and particularly focused on analyzing the losses caused to the water conservancy cause by the "saddle shape"; through the review, they further realized the harm of right-leaning conservative thinking, dogmatism, and empiricism. Everyone used a large number of facts in the review to show that wherever the rectification movement, the anti-rightist struggle, and the socialist debate were carried out thoroughly, the masses were fully mobilized and relied upon, a situation of sufficient energy, high enthusiasm, and many methods emerged, making water conservancy construction more, faster, better, and more economical; otherwise, there will inevitably be insufficient energy, numerous difficulties, and little progress in the work. These facts have made everyone more deeply aware of the great significance of putting politics in command in water conservancy work, thereby further clarifying the direction, enhancing confidence, and liberating thinking.

The meeting held that, due to the above achievements and experiences, and the vast number of cadres and the masses, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, are more energetic and striving, which has prepared extremely favorable conditions for the water conservancy construction this winter and next spring to develop on a larger scale and at a higher speed. Under these favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to strive to basically realize water conservancy in the southern region in one winter and one spring. As long as the guiding ideology is clear, the methods are correct, always walking at the forefront of the masses, and at the same time grasping the link of technological revolution, greater achievements can be achieved and more miracles can be created. The meeting requested that all regions carry out various preparatory work as early as possible, such as mobilizing the masses to formulate and debate plans, organizing forces to conduct surveying and design, training cadres and the masses, and preparing relevant materials and equipment, and at the same time, they must consolidate the completed projects, prepare to meet the test of unexpected disasters, and enable cadres and the masses to establish a firm belief in unyielding and repeated struggle.

The meeting also studied and deployed rural water conservancy work, schistosomiasis prevention and control work, and water conservancy scientific research work.

This meeting was held in Wuhan from May 21st. The participants included representatives from thirteen provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Shanghai, and representatives from three special zones in Shaanxi and Henan provinces, as well as representatives from relevant ministries, commissions, and offices of the Central Government, totaling 180 people.

　　争取南方地区基本水利化
    农田水利工作会议提出大干一冬春的宏伟任务
    新华社武汉7日电　5日在这里闭幕的南方地区农田水利工作会议，提出了大干一冬春，使南方地区基本实现水利化的宏伟任务，并且初步拟定了实现上述任务的各项计划指标。
    这次会议是由农业部召开的。会议期间，各地代表以绝大部分时间参观了襄阳专区的水利建设，交流了去冬今春各地大兴水利的重要经验，并且认真地根据社会主义建设总路线的精神检查了以往的工作。
    会议认为从去冬以来南方各地和全国一样，在全民整风运动的基础上，在万马奔腾的工农业全面大跃进的浪潮里，农田水利的建设一马当先地取得了史无前例的巨大成绩。据参加会议的各省（自治区）、市的不完全统计，这期间共扩大灌溉面积一亿三千多万亩，不少省、市的灌溉面积已达到现有耕地面积的70％—80％以上；另外，改善灌溉面积达一亿二千多万亩，完成防洪、防涝面积一亿亩，水土保持初步控制面积五万三千多平方公里，并且积极地进行了中、小河流的治理和农村水电站的筹建和兴建工作等。所有这些，对保证今年农业生产的大跃进，都已经开始和正在不断地发挥重大的作用。
    会议认为在这时期中，各地在兴修农田水利方面取得了丰富的经验，其中最主要的是：必须加强各级党委对水利工作的领导，在政治挂帅的前提下作到政治和技术结合，领导和群众结合，充分发挥群众的革命干劲和无穷的智慧；必须坚决贯彻“蓄水为主，小型为主，社办为主”的水利建设方针，在这个基础上结合必要的排水工程、大中型工程和由国家举办的工程；必须加强和扩大社与社之间、乡与乡之间、县与县之间、省与省之间的共产主义的协作；必须破除迷信，解放思想，大胆革新，大胆创造，不断地提高劳动效率和工程质量；此外，还必须加强对水利灌溉的管理，作到节约用水，合理用水，提高水的利用率。大家一致认为，襄阳专区在上述各方面都有较好的经验。这个专区采用“远处引水、近处灌田、盘山开渠、渠堰相连、闲时灌堰、忙时灌田”的办法建立西瓜秧式的自流灌溉网，是一项创造性的措施，为今后山区和丘陵区大搞水利建设找到了方向，建议各地大力推广。会议认为，福建省南平专区改进灌溉方法、改良烂泥田和改良冷水田的“三改”经验也很好，建议各地因地制宜地组织推广。
    与会者学习和讨论了党的八大二次会议的有关文件，并根据文件精神检查了几年来在水利建设中出现过的缺点和教训，特别着重地分析了“马鞍形”给水利事业带来的损失；通过检查，进一步认识到右倾保守思想、教条主义和经验主义的危害性。大家在检查中用大量事实说明：凡是整风运动、反右派斗争、社会主义大辩论进行得彻底、充分发动和依靠群众的地方，都出现了干劲足、热情高、办法多的局面，使水利建设作到多、快、好、省；反之，必然是干劲不足、困难重重，工作起色不大。这些事实使大家更深刻地认识到水利工作中政治挂帅的重大意义，从而更加明确了方向，增强了信心，解放了思想。
    会议认为，由于取得了以上成绩和经验，而广大干部和群众在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，干劲更加昂扬奋发，这就为今冬明春的水利建设以更大的规模和更高的速度发展准备了极为有利的条件。在这些有利条件下，争取在一冬一春的时间内，使南方地区基本实现水利化是完全可能的。只要领导思想明确，方法对头，时时刻刻走在群众的前列，同时又能抓好技术革命这个环节，就能取得更大的成绩，创造出更多的奇迹来。会议要求各地及早进行各项准备工作，如像发动群众制订和辩论规划，组织力量进行勘测、设计，训练干部和群众队伍，以及准备有关物资和器材等，同时还要对已完工程进行巩固工作，准备迎接意外灾害的考验，使干部和群众树立百折不挠反复搏斗的坚定信心。
    会议对农村水利工作、防治血吸虫病工作和水利科学研究工作等，也进行了研究和部署。
    这次会议是从5月21日起在武汉召开的。参加会议的，有湖北、湖南、江西、广东、福建、江苏、安徽、浙江、四川、云南、贵州、广西、上海等十三省（自治区）、市和陕西、河南两省的三个专区的代表，以及中央有关各部、委、室的代表共一百八十人。
