Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: Today was the unified action day called by the Japan Teachers' Union to oppose the "Performance Evaluation" system. All-member rallies were held in approximately 4,000 locations nationwide, demanding that prefectural boards of education or local boards of education abolish the "Performance Evaluation" system. A total of 500,000 members participated in the rallies across the country.

The Japan Teachers' Union also opposes the so-called "moral education" currently being implemented in 80% of elementary and junior high schools nationwide. It believes that the government's intention to take legislative measures to specifically allocate time for "moral education imposed on students" is an act of undermining democratic education.

Representatives from the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations visited the Ministry of Education on the 25th, demanding the abolition of the "Performance Evaluation" system. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and twenty-five other social organizations established the "Association for the Struggle to Defend Democratic Education and Oppose the 'Performance Evaluation' System" in Tokyo on the 25th. It plans to hold a national protest rally in mid-August and also establish local branches.

    要求取消“勤评”制度
    日本五十万教职员集会
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：今天是日本教职员工会号召举行的反对“勤务评定”制度统一行动日，在全国约四千个地方分别举行了全体会员大会，要求县教育委员会或者地方教育委员会取消“勤务评定”制度。参加各地大会的会员共达五十万人。
    日本教职员工会也反对目前正在全国80％的小学和初级中学中实行的所谓“道德教育”。它认为，政府准备采取立法措施，特别规定时间来进行“强加给学生的道德教育”是破坏民主教育的行为。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会的代表们25日曾经到文部省，要求取消“勤务评定”制度。日本工会总评议会和其他二十五个社会团体25日在东京成立了“保卫民主教育和反对‘勤务评定’制度斗争协会”。它准备在8月中旬举行全国抗议大会，并且还要成立地方分会。
