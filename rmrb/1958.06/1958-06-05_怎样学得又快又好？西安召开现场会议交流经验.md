How to Learn Quickly and Well?
Xi'an Holds On-Site Meeting to Exchange Experiences

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 4th dispatch) In order to enable the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory to rapidly blossom and bear fruit in the industrial enterprises of the Xi'an area, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held three on-site meetings separately at the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, and the Northwest Automobile Machine Tool Repair Factory to exchange experiences in "promoting the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory" and to criticize some erroneous understandings.

    Before holding the on-site meetings, the Xi'an Municipal Committee inspected the situation of various industrial enterprises in promoting the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory and found that there were two different promotion methods. One is to implement politics in command, first letting go and mobilizing workers to participate in management, which also promotes cadres to participate in labor and rapidly reform unreasonable rules and regulations. This is a fast and good way to promote the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory. The other is that leaders believe that the cultural level and awareness of workers are low, and they need to undergo a period of training before they can participate in management work. Therefore, they adopt a top-down method. This is a slow and poor way to promote.

    The units that have promoted the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory quickly and well include the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, the Northwest Automobile Machine Tool Repair Factory, and the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory. After the leaders of the Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory saw the report introducing the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory, they organized employees to study and adopted the method of "studying, debating, promoting, and solving problems simultaneously" to promote it throughout the factory. The vast majority of workers actively participated in production management. For example, some workers said, "We have discussed this matter a long time ago. What the workers of the Qinghua Factory can do, we can definitely do." Some groups even automatically formulated methods for participating in management. The leadership quickly handed over part of the management work to the workers based on the opinions put forward by the workers. After the workers participated in management, the workload of the cadres was reduced, and they could free up time to participate in labor. After the activities of workers participating in management and cadres participating in labor began, it also promoted the rapid reform of unreasonable rules and regulations. As a result of this mutual promotion, within a dozen days, the vast majority of workers in the factory participated in management, 70% of the cadres participated in half-day labor every day, and 183 kinds of unreasonable rules and regulations in the factory were revised or abolished, accounting for 76% of the total number of rules and regulations in the factory. Due to these many aspects of reform, the entire factory has undergone great changes. For example, after the tool accounting system was changed, the accounting department reduced an average of more than 24,000 requisition slips and more than 51,000 stamping procedures per month, so that the work that originally required two people to work overtime could be completed by one person working half a day. The leaders were also freed from the circle of affairs, went deep into the grassroots, participated in labor, and studied and solved major problems in production. (Li Qian)

　　怎样学得又快又好？
　　西安召开现场会议交流经验
    本报西安4日电　为了使庆华工具厂的经验迅速地在西安地区的工业企业中开花结果，中共西安市委从最近分别在西安机器制造厂、西安人民搪瓷厂和西北汽车机具修配厂等单位召开了三个现场会议，交流“推广庆华工具厂经验”的经验，并批判一些错误认识。
    在召开现场会议以前，西安市委检查了各工业企业推广庆华工具厂经验的情况，发现有两种不同的推广法。一种是实行政治挂帅，首先放手发动工人参加管理，这样，同时也就促使干部参加劳动和迅速改革不合理的规章制度。这是推广庆华工具厂经验又快又好的办法。另一种是领导人员认为工人的文化水平低，觉悟低，需要经过一个时期的训练才能够参加管理工作，因此采用由上往下贯的办法。这是推广得又慢又差的方法。
    推广庆华工具厂的经验又快又好的有西安机器制造厂，西北汽车机具修配厂，新西北印染厂等单位。西安机器制造厂领导人看到报上介绍庆华工具厂的经验以后，即组织职工学习，并采取“边学习、边辩论、边推广、边解决问题”的办法，在全厂范围内推广。绝大多数工人都积极参加生产管理。如有的工人说，“我们早就讨论过这件事情了，庆华厂的工人能干的事，我们也一定能办到。”有些小组还自动制订出参加管理的办法。领导上很快就根据工人们所提的意见，把一部分管理工作交给工人。工人参加管理以后，干部的工作减少了，就可以抽出时间下去参加劳动。当工人参加管理，干部参加劳动的活动开始以后，也就促进了不合理的规章制度的迅速改革。这样互相推动的结果，在十几天的时间内，全厂绝大部分的工人都参加了管理，70％的干部参加了每天半日劳动，并把全厂不合理的规章制度修改或废除了一百八十三种，占全厂规章制度总数的76％。由于这许多方面的改革，全厂面貌大大改观。如工具核算的制度改变以后，会计科平均每月减少二万四千多张领用单，五万一千多次盖章手续，使原来两个人加班加点做不完的工作，一个人每日工作半天就能干完。领导人员也从事务圈子里解脱出来，深入基层，参加劳动，研究解决生产中的重大问题。　（李茜）
