Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 25th: Most newspapers in Damascus today published the full text of the TASS statement of June 24 concerning the US-UK plot to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. All the newspapers carried news on the front page with banner headlines welcoming the Soviet Union's warning to the US-UK ruling clique.

　　"Al-Nasr," "Al-Manar" and "Al-Rai al-Aam" also published editorials on the TASS statement. The "Al-Nasr" editorial stated, "Dulles' already exposed trick of pushing the world to the brink of war can no longer deceive anyone. The Soviet Union's recent warning reminds Dulles that any act of intervention in Lebanon can only be regarded as a challenge to the whole world, and the whole world, including the Soviet Union, will deal with this intervention. Now is the time for Dulles to seriously consider this warning."

　　"Al-Manar" said in its editorial: "Facts have proven that the Soviet Union is closely watching the imperialist countries, and no matter what excuses these countries use or what conspiracies they carry out, it will never allow them to undermine peace." The newspaper added: "This is another new opportunity to congratulate the Soviet Union on the continuous victory of its international policy. The Soviet Union's international policy is advancing from victory to victory, while the Western countries' policies are advancing from failure to failure." The "Al-Rai al-Aam" editorial pointed out that the TASS statement is a serious warning to the West.

    大马士革报纸欢迎塔斯社声明
    据新华社大马士革25日电 大马士革的多数报纸今天全文刊载了塔斯社24日就美英策划武装干涉黎巴嫩内政一事发表的声明。所有报纸都在第一版上以通栏大标题登载了欢迎苏联对美英统治集团发出警告的新闻。
    “胜利报”、“灯塔报”和“舆论报”还就塔斯社声明发表了社论。“胜利报”的社论说，“杜勒斯的已经被揭穿的把世界推到战争边缘的把戏再也欺骗不了任何人了。苏联最近的警告提醒杜勒斯，对黎巴嫩的任何干涉行为只能被认为是对全世界的挑战，而全世界，包括苏联在内，将会对付这种干涉。现在是由杜勒斯认真地考虑这个警告的时候了。”
    “灯塔报”在社论中说：“事实证明，苏联是在密切注视着帝国主义国家，不管这些国家用什么借口或者进行什么阴谋，它是绝不会允许它们破坏和平的。”这家报纸又说：“这是再一次向苏联祝贺它的国际政策的不断胜利的新机会。苏联的国际政策是从胜利走向胜利，而西方国家的政策则是从失败走向失败。”“舆论报”的社论指出，塔斯社的声明是对西方的严正警告。
