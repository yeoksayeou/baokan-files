Timber Chute Transports Timber

    In Zashuling, She County, in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, two wooden bridges, each ten li long, have appeared from the mountains to the bottom. These are "concave bridge-like timber chutes" created by Hua Changjiang of the She County Forestry Bureau logging team.

    Timber transportation in the mountainous areas of Anhui has historically relied on human labor. The successful creation of the "timber chute" is a major revolution in timber transportation in the mountains. In the past, manual transport took four hours to move a log from the mountain top to the foot of the mountain; now, using the "timber chute," it takes only three minutes at most. The transportation cost per cubic meter of timber by manual labor was 8 yuan and 45 fen, while the "timber chute" transportation costs only 1 yuan and 13 fen.

    木滑道运木材
    皖南山区的歙县杂树岭，从山上到山下出现了两条各长十华里的木桥，这是歙县森林工业局采伐队花长江创造的“凹型桥状木滑道”。
    安徽山区木材运输工作，历年来一直依靠人力肩运。“木滑道”的创造成功，是山区木材运输上的重大革命。过去用人力运，一根木料从山顶到山脚需四小时，现在用“木滑道”放送最多只要三分钟。肩运木材每立方公尺的运费为八元四角五分，“木滑道”运输只要一元一角三分。　侯启文摄（安徽日报供稿）
