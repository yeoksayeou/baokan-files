Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th -- It is reported that the uprising people's forces in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, repelled an attack by pro-Western government forces again on the 25th. The government forces used heavy artillery and armored vehicles in an attempt to seize the Basta district, which has been held by the uprising people's forces for more than a month, but they failed once again.

It is reported that several explosions occurred near the residence of the pro-Western Foreign Minister Malik on the 25th.

Meanwhile, according to Damascus newspapers, government forces attempted to seize the villages of Juba, Maruna, and Haura in southern Lebanon, as well as Bab Tabbaneh and the port of Tripoli in northern Lebanon on the 25th, but all resulted in disastrous defeats.

According to today's "Al-Jamahir" newspaper in Damascus, several American helicopters arrived at Beirut airport on the 25th, carrying a large amount of American munitions.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th -- Just as the pro-Western President Chamoun of Lebanon publicly announced in Beirut that he would request British and American troops to assist him, British government ministers in London hinted at the possibility of direct armed intervention in Lebanon.

Last night, the British House of Commons held a debate. When severely questioned, Defense Minister Sandys admitted that the British troops transferred to Cyprus were aimed at Lebanon. He said that the British troops there were prepared to "deal with possible emergencies in the Eastern Mediterranean region." Labor Party members strongly demanded that the government guarantee that Britain would not intervene unless authorized by the United Nations Security Council or General Assembly.

However, Foreign Secretary Lloyd, speaking on behalf of the government, refused to provide any guarantees. He only vaguely said that "no action will be taken that violates the United Nations Charter." When a Labor Party member asked him to answer the question of "who will interpret the Charter," the Foreign Secretary presented his "carefully considered reply," emphasizing that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter could be invoked.

People here believe that Lloyd's reply is a dangerous signal indicating that Britain intends to carry out armed intervention. The fact that this deliberate statement was issued after Washington and Beirut clamored that the internal conflict in Lebanon was a foreign "armed attack" reinforces the above impression.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th -- According to Damascus Radio, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld left Beirut for New York on the afternoon of the 25th. Before leaving, he declined to comment on his trip to the Middle East.

Syrian News Agency quoted Lebanese political figures on the 25th as saying that UN observers have been in contact with opposition leaders. The opposition leaders put forward a number of demands, including: Chamoun must resign and leave Lebanon; allow neutral people to organize the government, dissolve the parliament, and hold new elections, and a new parliament elect the president of the republic, and release all those arrested due to recent events, etc.

Damascus Radio reported that a UN spokesperson in Beirut said on the 25th that there are now ninety-four UN observers in Lebanon.

    黎巴嫩起义人民英勇奋战
    连续击退政府军进攻
    英政府大臣暗示将对黎巴嫩进行直接干涉
    新华社大马士革26日电　据报道，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特的起义人民部队在25日再度击退亲西方政府部队的进攻。政府部队使用了重炮和装甲车，企图进占起义人民部队一个多月来一直坚守的巴斯塔区，但是他们又一次失败了。
    据报道，25日在亲西方的外交部长马利克的住宅附近发生了几次爆炸。
    同时，据大马士革报纸报道，政府部队在25日企图进占黎巴嫩南部的朱巴、马鲁纳和豪拉等村庄，以及黎巴嫩北部的巴布塔纳奈赫和的黎波里港，但是结果都遭到惨败。
    据大马士革“群众报”今天报道，有好几架美国直升飞机在25日到达贝鲁特机场，载来了许多美国军火。
    据新华社伦敦26日电　正当黎巴嫩亲西方的总统夏蒙在贝鲁特公开宣布他将要求英美部队去援助他的时候，伦敦的英国政府大臣们暗示有可能对黎巴嫩进行直接的武装干涉。
    昨晚英国下院举行了辩论，国防大臣桑迪斯在受到猛烈的质询时承认，调往塞浦路斯的英国部队矛头正是指向黎巴嫩。他说，那里的英国部队准备“应付在地中海东部地区可能发生的紧急事变”。工党议员竭力要求政府方面保证：除非得到联合国安全理事会或大会的授权，英国将不进行干涉。
    但是外交大臣劳埃德在代表政府发言时拒绝提供任何保证。他只是含糊地说，“将不采取违背联合国宪章的任何行动。”当工党议员提出“将由谁来解释宪章”的问题要他回答的时候，外交大臣提出了他的“经过慎重考虑的答复”，他着重表示，可能运用联合国宪章第五十一条。
    这里人士认为劳埃德的答复是一个表明英国要进行武装干涉的危险的信号。这个有意的声明是在华盛顿和贝鲁特叫嚷黎巴嫩的内部冲突是外来的“武力攻击”之后发出的这个事实更加强了上述的印象。
    据新华社大马士革26日电　据大马士革电台报道，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在25日下午离开贝鲁特回纽约。临行之前，他拒绝就他的中东之行发表意见。
    叙利亚通讯社25日援引黎巴嫩政界人士的话说，联合国观察员已经同反对党派领袖们进行了接触。反对党派领袖提出了一些要求，其中包括：夏蒙必须辞职并且离开黎巴嫩；让中立人士组织政府，解散议会，并且举行新选举，由新议会选举共和国总统以及释放所有由于最近事件而被逮捕的人等等。
    大马士革电台报道，在贝鲁特的联合国发言人25日说，现在在黎巴嫩的联合国观察员已经达到九十四人。
