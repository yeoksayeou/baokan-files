The Dapo Agricultural Cooperative in Tianchi Township, Yibin County, Sichuan Province, was once known for its abnormal cadre-masses relations and relatively backward production. In recent months, however, a new situation of cadre-mass unity and production has emerged in this cooperative. In the recent inspection and appraisal, its various productions have been at the forefront and were rated as the second best in the whole township. Speaking of these changes, the members of the Dapo Cooperative said excitedly: This is all brought about by the rectification movement.

Before the rectification movement, the nine main cadres of Dapo Cooperative not only rarely participated in agricultural labor, but also did not seriously lead the cooperative's production. They were also indifferent to the production and life difficulties of the members. As a result, many members had low production enthusiasm.

The rural rectification movement last winter completely changed this situation. The main cadres of the entire cooperative are now divided into eight production teams, taking responsibility for production in the teams, leading production, and often investigating and understanding the production and living conditions of the members, solving their various difficulties.

Visiting the homes of the members and solving their various difficulties has also become a regular task for the cadres of the Dapo Cooperative. Shortly after the rectification, the cooperative conducted a special survey, re-arranging thirteen poor members and members lacking labor, allowing them to take on more light farm work and sideline labor, and providing care in their lives. When some members fell ill, the cooperative director and production team leader personally went to express their sympathy, delivering the needed advances and food to their door, and sometimes personally taking the members to the county health clinic for treatment. The cadres' meticulous care for the members made the members even more protective of the interests of the cooperative. They put forward many rationalization proposals to the cadres in the management of rice seedlings, cultivation of sweet potato seedlings, and solving the shortage of fertilizer, and actively fought against various bad phenomena in the cooperative.

With the close cooperation and joint efforts of cadres and masses, the Dapo Cooperative has completed the tasks of early rice sowing and transplanting, wheat harvesting, and sweet potato planting relatively well this year. They plan to increase the unit yield of grain to 1,200 jin, an increase of more than double that of last year.

　　大坡社干群团结好
    本报讯四川省宜宾县天池乡大坡农业社，原来是以干部、群众关系不正常、生产比较落后出名的。近几个月来，这个社里却出现了干部、群众团结生产的新局面。在最近的检查评比中，它的各项生产都走在前列，被评为全乡的第二名。谈到这些变化，大坡社社员都兴奋地说：这全是整风运动带来的。
    大坡社在整风以前，九个主要干部不仅很少参加农业劳动，对全社生产也没有认真领导。社员生产、生活上的困难，他们也漠不关心。不少社员生产情绪因而低落。
    去年冬天的农村整风运动，彻底改变了这种情况。全社主要干部分工负责八个生产队，在队里参加生产，领导生产，还经常调查了解社员生产和生活情况，解决他们的各种困难。
    访问社员家庭，解决社员的各种困难，也成了大坡社干部的一项经常工作。整风后不久，社里就专门进行了一次调查，对十三户贫困和缺乏劳动力的社员重行安排，让他们多担负轻便的农活和副业劳动，并在生活上给予照顾。有的社员生了病，社主任、生产队长都亲自去慰问，把需要的预支款和食物送上门去，有时还亲自送社员到县卫生院诊治。干部无微不至地关怀社员，社员们也更加爱护社的利益。他们在秧田管理、培育甘薯苗和解决缺肥困难等方面向干部提出许多合理化建议，并积极地与社内各种不良现象作斗争。
    在干部、群众密切合作和共同努力下，今年大坡社早稻播种和栽插、小麦收割、甘薯种植等项生产任务都完成得比较出色。他们计划把粮食单位产量提高到一千二百斤，比去年增产一倍以上。
