Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 18th (TASS): The Central Standing Committee and Parliamentary Group of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) issued a statement on June 18 regarding Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's policy address, saying that Kishi Nobusuke's address was a challenge to the Japanese people. The claims of defending "democracy" and pursuing "independent" foreign policy contained in this speech are intended to deceive the Japanese people.

The Communist Party criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy towards China and severely attacked the Kishi Nobusuke government's domestic policies. The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke government only cares about the interests of monopoly capitalists and shifts the full burden of the consequences of the economic recession onto the working people. This government also persecutes the working class.

The statement concluded by saying that the Communist Party will launch a tenacious struggle to unite with socialists, strengthen trade union power, and strive to establish a people's united front to defend the interests of the working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Opposition party members in Japan questioned Nobusuke Kishi's policy speech in the Diet on the 18th. They opposed Japan's nuclear armament and the promotion of reactionary dictatorial rule, and demanded the normalization of Japan-China relations.

Socialist Senator Masaru Sone questioned whether the government was prepared to sign an international agreement banning the transportation of nuclear weapons and missiles into Japan. In his reply, Kishi Nobusuke refused to conclude an agreement between Japan and the United States regarding not transporting nuclear weapons into Japan.

Masaru Sone demanded that the government put Japan-China relations on the right track and resolutely implement the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement in its entirety. In their replies, Kishi Nobusuke and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama both stated that they would adhere to a policy of hostility towards China. They said that regarding the issue of relations with China, the Kishi Nobusuke government still adopts a "wait and see" attitude. When Fujiyama repeated this cliché, someone shouted from the seats, "That won't work!"

Xinhua News Agency, June 18th (TASS, Tokyo): Tokyo laborers held a mass rally on the 18th to protest the Japanese government's persecution of various Japanese trade unions demanding the issuance of summer allowances to workers and staff. More than 20,000 employees from Tokyo's various enterprises and institutions braved the rain to participate in the mass rally organized by the Tokyo trade unions, which are members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

The participants passed a resolution demanding the government to issue summer allowances in the name of trade union members, and protested against the continued arrest of trade union leaders.

After the mass rally, a demonstration was held.

    抨击岸信介反动施政方针
    东京工人举行大会抗议岸政府迫害工会领袖
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社东京18日讯：日本共产党中央常任干部会和议会党团18日就岸信介首相的施政演说发表声明说，岸信介的演说是对日本人民的挑战。这篇演说中所包含的保卫“民主”和奉行“独立”的外交政策的说法，其目的是为了欺骗日本人民。
    共产党批评岸信介政府对中国的政策，并严厉抨击岸信介政府的国内政策。声明说，岸信介政府只关心垄断资本家的利益，把经济萧条所造成的后果的全部重担转嫁到劳动人民的肩上，这个政府还迫害工人阶级。
    声明最后说，共产党将展开顽强的斗争，争取同社会党人联合行动，加强工会力量和争取建立人民统一战线，以保卫劳动人民的利益。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本反对党议员18日在国会对岸信介的施政方针演说进行质询，他们反对日本实行核武装和推行反动独裁的统治，并且要求使日中关系正常化。
    社会党参议员曾祢益质问政府是否准备签订关于禁止把核武器和导弹运进日本的国际协定。岸信介在答复时拒绝由日美两国缔结关于不把核武器运进日本的协定。
    曾祢益要求政府使日中关系走上正轨，下决心完全实施第四次日中贸易协定。岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎在答复中都表示要坚持敌视中国的政策，他们说，关于和中国的关系问题，岸信介政府仍然采取“静观”的态度。当藤山重弹这套滥调时，在议席中有人高呼说：“这样做是不行的！” 
    据新华社18日讯　塔斯社东京讯：东京劳动者18日举行群众大会，抗议日本政府对要求发给工人和职员夏季津贴的日本各工会的迫害。东京各企业机关的两万多职工冒雨参加了日本工会总评议会的成员——东京各工会组织的群众大会。
    与会者通过了一项决议，以工会会员的名义要求政府发放夏季津贴，并且对继续逮捕工会领导人的做法表示抗议。
    群众大会结束后，举行了示威游行。
