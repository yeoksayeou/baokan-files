Opera depicting modern life has become the mainstream. The vast numbers of opera performers are full of enthusiasm, competing to compile and perform modern operas.

(By our newspaper) The tide of the Socialist Great Leap Forward has pushed China's traditional opera art to a new stage. Since the beginning of this year, opera depicting modern life has formed a huge mainstream. A rich and colorful array of excellent plays closely integrated with current production and political movements has appeared on the stage. These plays make the long-standing art of opera shine with the glory of the socialist era, becoming a force for promoting the construction of socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results.

This year, almost all types of opera across the country have enthusiastically invested in the performance of modern operas, including long-standing genres such as Han Opera, Peking Opera, and Sichuan Opera. The successful experiment of the Peking Opera "The White Haired Girl" thoroughly shattered the conservative idea that opera could not depict modern life. After "The White Haired Girl," the Peking Opera community in Beijing performed modern plays such as "Wisely Capturing Bandit Boss Vulture." The Shanghai Peking Opera Company is also rehearsing "Red Storm" and "Zhao Yiman." The Shanghai opera community has performed more than 300 modern plays this year. Local folk professional troupes have also actively performed many modern plays.

The socialist enthusiasm of the vast numbers of opera performers has been greatly enhanced. They are enthusiastically involved in creative activities, everyone working together, composing and performing on the spot, and creating collectively. This has changed the practice of slow opera reform by a small number of directors and screenwriters, and a mass creative upsurge has quickly emerged, producing a large number of modern plays with rich content and diverse forms. There are short and concise street plays, large multi-act plays, fantasy mythological plays, comedies, and various forms of traditional song and dance. In Hunan Province, more than 100 scripts of various sizes were created in one day on the "Creative Leap Forward Day" on June 5.

The vast majority of modern plays performed this year depict the current Socialist Great Leap Forward. The short street plays such as "A Thousand Li a Day" and "Uncontainable Girl" first performed by the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe caused a sensation in Beijing. Subsequently, opera communities across the country successively presented lively and concise short plays publicizing the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, and eradicating illiteracy.

The improvement of the political ideology of opera performers and the emphasis on inheriting tradition in recent years have led to a leap in the quality of modern opera performances this year. Many famous actors have actively and earnestly participated in performing modern operas. Some troupes have gained a sense of real life through long-term in-depth performances in factories and rural areas, and have therefore successfully created various modern characters on stage. The Henan Yu Opera Troupe No. 3, which has just returned from rural performances, performs Liu Hulan's revolutionary heroism even more outstandingly than the "Liu Hulan" performed by ordinary troupes. When performing modern operas, many troupes have also carried out innovation and creation in art. For example, some plays have absorbed the advantages of drama and opera performances, but still maintain the characteristics of traditional opera very well.

In recent years, the stage practice and continuous exploration and research of opera performing modern life have brought the reform of opera in our country to a new stage. The dozens of modern plays being shown at the Modern Opera Symposium and Performance currently being held in Beijing are a microcosm of the vigorous development of opera art across the country.

    戏曲表现现代生活形成主流
    广大戏曲艺人热情洋溢，争编争演现代戏
    本报讯　社会主义大跃进的浪潮，把我国传统的戏曲艺术推上了一个新的阶段。今年以来，戏曲表现现代生活已形成巨大的主流。剧坛上出现了丰富多彩的密切结合当前生产和政治运动的大量优秀剧目，这些剧目使历史悠久的戏曲艺术闪耀着社会主义时代的光辉，成为推动多快好省建设社会主义的一支力量。
    今年，全国几乎所有的戏曲剧种都热情地投入了现代戏的演出，包括历史悠久的汉剧、京剧、川剧等剧种。京剧“白毛女”的成功尝试，彻底打破了那种认为戏曲不能表现现代生活的保守思想。北京京剧界继“白毛女”之后，又演出了“智擒惯匪座山雕”等现代剧。上海京剧院也正在排演“红色风暴”和“赵一曼”。上海戏曲界今年已演出了三百多个现代剧。各地的民间职业剧团也都积极地演出了许多现代剧目。
    广大戏曲艺人的社会主义积极性大大提高。他们热情地投入创作活动，大家动手，现编现演，集体创作，改变了由少数编导人员慢腾腾进行戏曲改革的作法，迅速出现了群众性的创作热潮，产生了内容丰富、形式多样的大批现代剧目。有短小精悍的街头剧，有大型的多幕剧，有幻想神话剧，有喜剧，还有传统歌舞开打等多种形式。湖南省在6月5日的“创作跃进日”里，一天就创作出大小剧本一百多个。
    今年演出的现代剧目绝大部分都是表现当前社会主义大跃进的。杭州市越剧团最早演出的“一日千里”、“关不住的姑娘”等短小的街头剧曾轰动了北京城，随之，各地戏曲界都陆续出现了宣传工农业大跃进、除四害讲卫生、扫盲等活泼精悍的小戏。
    几年来戏曲艺人政治思想的提高及对继承传统的重视，使今年现代戏的演出质量有了飞跃的进步。许多著名演员都积极认真的参加表演现代戏。有些剧团更在长期深入工厂农村演出中，获得对实际生活的感受，因而在舞台上成功地创造了各种现代人物的形象。刚从农村演出归来的河南豫剧三团，他们表演刘胡兰的革命英雄气概，比一般剧团演出的“刘胡兰”更为出色。许多剧团在演出现代戏时，还在艺术上进行了革新与创造，如有的剧目吸收了话剧、歌剧表演上的优点，却仍能很好的保持着传统戏曲的特长。
    几年来，戏曲表演现代生活的舞台实践和不断的摸索研究，使目前我国的戏曲改革进入新的阶段。正在北京举行的现代戏曲座谈会观摩演出的几十个现代剧，正是全国戏曲艺术蓬勃发展的一个缩影。
