Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd. Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently completed another steelmaking furnace, which is currently the largest large-scale open-hearth furnace in China.

Yesterday morning, this open-hearth furnace produced its first batch of molten steel three months ahead of the national plan. At seven o'clock, the steelworkers excitedly opened the tapping hole. Soon, the dazzling molten steel flowed out along the two tapping spouts, and thousands of golden sparks flew everywhere. At this time, the workers standing around the open-hearth furnace gave warm applause to the Soviet experts and steelworkers who had stayed by the furnace all night, and to the builders who had worked day and night for several months to build this open-hearth furnace.

In the construction of this open-hearth furnace, the Anshan Iron and Steel construction workers resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and created a miracle in the history of Anshan Iron and Steel construction. Starting from the installation of the metal structure, it took only two months to install this large-scale, new open-hearth furnace, as well as a mixer, a 275-ton crane, and 10 kilometers of railway and other equipment. When installing the crane, the metal structure installation workers developed a method of parallel operation with two cranes, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient lifting equipment and completing the task two months ahead of schedule. Immediately afterwards, the mechanical installation workers and electrical installation workers cooperated closely with each other and adopted a cross-parallel operation method, creating a new record of installing a large crane in half a month; in the past, it took two months to install a 140-ton crane, just for the installation of mechanical equipment.

The newly put into production open-hearth furnace is the first large-scale fixed open-hearth furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel, and it is also the largest and most modern open-hearth furnace in China. Its equipment is fully automated, and trains and trams loaded with raw materials can be driven directly to the front of the furnace door; furnace patching, furnace refining, and deoxidizer addition are all replaced by machinery. From the first day of its operation, this open-hearth furnace has also taken on the task of training steelworkers and technicians for Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel.

### 鞍钢建设者日日夜夜辛勤劳动  快速建成国内最大的平炉

    鞍钢建设者日日夜夜辛勤劳动
    快速建成国内最大的平炉
    新华社鞍山2日电  鞍山钢铁公司最近又建成了一座炼钢炉，这是我国目前最大的一座大型平炉。
    昨天清晨，这座平炉比国家计划提前三个月炼出了第一炉钢水。七点，炼钢工人们兴奋地打开了出钢口。不一会，光彩耀目的钢水顺着两个出钢槽流了出来，千万点金星到处飞扬。这时，站在平炉四周的职工用热烈的掌声，向在平炉旁守了一整夜的苏联专家和炼钢工人祝贺，向几个月来为建设这座平炉而日日夜夜辛勤劳动的建设者祝贺。
    鞍钢建设者在这座平炉的建设过程中，坚决贯彻了多快好省的社会主义建设方针，创造了鞍钢建筑史上的奇迹。从金属结构安装开始，仅仅两个月的时间，便安装好了这座规模大、设备新的平炉，以及混铁炉、起重二百七十五吨的吊车和十公里铁路等设备。在安装吊车时，金属结构安装工人研究出了两台起重机平行作业的方法，克服了起重设备不足的困难，提前两个月完成了任务。紧接着，机械安装工人和电气安装工人互相紧密配合，采用交叉平行作业方法，创造了半个月安装一台大吊车的新纪录；而过去安装一台一百四十吨的吊车，单是安装机械设备就要花两个月的时间。
    新投入生产的平炉是鞍钢第一座大型固定式平炉，也是目前我国最大的、最近代化的平炉，它的设备全部是自动化的，装载着原料的火车和电车可以直接开到炉门前面；补炉、炼炉和投脱氧剂等，也全部由机械代替了。这座平炉从它开工生产的第一天起，还担负起了为武钢、包钢培养炼钢工人和技术人员的任务。
