Xinhua News Agency, June 16th - Ten hospitals in the Beijing area of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have achieved initial success in breaking superstitions, boldly innovating, and cultivating a new style of socialist hospitals.

The rectification movement has placed politics in command in these hospitals. In the "smashing the old and establishing the new" debate, centered on rectifying medical practices, medical personnel have liquidated various forms of individualism, broken away from the slavish ideology of worshiping the US and UK and belittling themselves, and carried out a major revolution in socialist style in terms of medical construction, medical technology, and many rules and regulations.

After thoroughly repudiating the idea of blindly following "British and American standards" and regarding medical technology from capitalist countries as "golden rules," the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army saw the disappearance of "inevitability" and "conditionalism" in medical work. New records of technological innovation have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. The hospital's gynecology department boldly broke with superstition and studied cases of "umbilical cord prolapse before delivery, with a 50% fetal mortality rate" as believed by capitalist medicine. In April, they treated five pregnant women with umbilical cord prolapse, all of whom were successful, with both the fetus surviving and the mother safe. The hospital's surgery department had long believed that "the United States has 2% surgical wound infections, and we cannot eliminate them." The Great Leap Forward boosted their enthusiasm, and they put forward the slogan "Eliminate surgical wound infections." They adopted measures such as strict disinfection before surgery and strengthening sterile procedures. In the first quarter of this year, they eliminated sterile surgical wound infections, and contaminated surgical wound infections also dropped from 3.7% to 1.8%.

"Get rid of inferiority complex, develop new businesses." Senior doctors who used to call diseases that capitalist countries' medicine could not solve as "incurable diseases" now have lofty ambitions and dare to think and act; small hospitals that always thought "they couldn't do it" are also working hard to catch up with advanced levels. The Air Force General Hospital used to say about the common diseases of flight personnel: "The international community cannot solve them, what can we do?" Now it's "We won't stop until we solve them." Medical personnel are vying to collect information and conduct research. Finding experience and writing papers has become the trend. In the past, whenever the Thoracic Hospital encountered a patient with "atrial septal defect," they considered it an "incurable disease" and were helpless. Now, they want to turn this "incurable disease" that cannot be treated at home or abroad into a "curable condition." After full research and preparation, they recently successfully performed "repair" surgery. The surgery department of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army has also recently launched six new surgeries, such as "liver resection."

Under the guiding ideology of "everything for the convenience of patients," these hospitals have recently carried out resolute reforms of many hospital rules and regulations. The cardiology department of the Thoracic Hospital recently canceled six of the "ten routine examinations" for patients upon admission. For example: regardless of whether the patient has had syphilis, blood must be drawn from the patient for "syphilis serological reaction"; regardless of the severity of the patient's condition, they must go to the operating room for one or two hours of "cardiac catheterization" examination, etc. After these "routines" were cancelled, the suffering of patients was reduced, drugs were saved, and many medical personnel no longer had to be busy all day with unnecessary routine examinations. At the beginning of the Great Leap Forward, the General Hospital of the Beijing Military Region changed the outpatient clinic from a "one-shift system" to a "three-eight system." Recently, it has been thoroughly reformed and changed to "open every day, open all the time, and see patients as soon as they arrive." The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army has also recently implemented the "three staff (nursing staff, cleaning staff, and catering staff) combined into one" and "doctor-nurse collaboration." Doctors help nurses with nursing work and participate in the nurses' "handover meetings"; nurses observe and judge the condition in a timely manner, act as doctors' assistants, and also reform the equipment in the ward that was built under the influence of bourgeois hospitals in the past, which was purely for aesthetics and not very suitable. In addition, after analyzing the psychology of patients and their families, each hospital overturned the old arguments that family visits to patients are "stimulating to patients" and "affect treatment," and universally revised the "visiting system," increasing the time and frequency of visits.

Recently, these ten hospitals exchanged work experience together. With mutual support, promotion, and inspiration, each hospital is currently continuing to boldly innovate and advance towards a hospital in the style of socialism with overwhelming momentum.

    社会主义医院的新风格
    解放军十个医院敢想敢做，“绝症”变“活症”
    新华社16日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京地区的十个医院，在破除迷信，大胆革新，培养社会主义医院的新风格中，旗开得胜。
    整风运动使这些医院政治挂了“帅”。在以整顿医疗作风为中心的“大破大立”的大辩论中，医务人员清算了形形色色的个人主义，破除了崇拜英美、妄自菲薄的奴隶思想，从医务建设、医疗技术，到许多规章制度等方面，进行了社会主义风格的大革新。
    解放军总医院在大破热衷“英美标准”，视资本主义国家医学技术为“金科玉律”的思想以后，医疗工作上的“难免论”、“条件论”等匿迹了，革新技术的新纪录像雨后春笋，不断涌现。这个医院的妇科，大胆破除迷信，对资本主义国家医学认为“产妇临产前脐带脱垂，胎儿死亡率50％”的病例进行了研究，并且在4月份治疗了五个患脐带脱垂的产妇，全部成功，胎儿成活，母亲平安。这个医院的外科，对手术后的切口感染，长期认为“美国有2％，我们不能消灭”。大跃进鼓足了他们的干劲，提出“消灭切口感染”的口号，他们采取了手术前严密消毒，加强无菌操作等措施，今年第一季度就消灭了无菌切口感染，沾染切口感染也由过去3.7％降到1.8％。
    “打掉自卑感，开展新业务”，过去称资本主义国家医学上没解决的病为“绝症”的高级医生，现在壮志凌云，敢想敢做了；一向认为“自己不行”的小医院，也干劲十足地赶先进水平。空军总医院，对空勤人员的多发病，过去说：“国际上都不能解决，我们有什么办法？”现在是“不解决不罢休”。医务人员个个争先地搜集资料，进行研究。找经验，写论文成了风气。胸科医院过去一遇到患“心脏房间间隔缺损”的病人，就认为是“绝症”，束手无策。现在，他们要把这种国内外无法治疗的“绝症”，变成“活症”，经过充分研究和准备，最近他们成功地施行了“修补”手术。解放军总医院外科，还在最近开展了“切除肝脏”等六项新手术。
    这些医院在“一切便利于病人”的指导思想下，最近还对医院的许多规章制度进行了坚决的改革。胸科医院心脏内科，最近取消了病人入院“十项常规检查”中的六项。如：不问病人是否患过梅毒，都要从病人身上抽血化验“梅毒血清反应”；不管病人病情轻重，都要到手术室进行一两小时“心导管”检查等。这些“常规”取消后，减轻了病人的痛苦，节省了药物，许多医务人员也不必整天忙于不必要的常规检查中了。北京部队总医院，在大跃进之初把门诊“一班制”改为“三八制”，最近又进行了彻底改革，改为“日日开放，时时开放，随到随诊”。解放军总医院最近还实行了“三员（护理员、清洁员、配膳员）合一”和“医（生）护（士）协作”。医生帮助护士做护理工作，参加护士的“交班会”；护士及时观察、判断病情，做医生的助手，并且把病房里过去在资产阶级医院影响下建设起来的单纯追求美观而不太适用的设备，也进行了改革。另外，各医院在分析病人和病人家属的心理之后，推翻了家属探视病人“对病人有刺激”和“影响治疗”等旧论调，普遍修订了“探视制度”，增加了探病时间和次数。
    最近，这十个医院在一起交流了工作经验。在相互支持、推动和启发下，目前各医院正以排山倒海之势，继续大胆革新，向社会主义风格的医院进军。
