Xinhua News Agency, June 20th – Chairman Mao Zedong visited the Jinggangshan brand sedan manufactured by the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory, the Julong brand tractor manufactured by the Xingping Machinery Factory, and the Hongqi brand universal chassis tractor manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory at Zhongnanhai at 7:00 p.m. today, and inquired in detail about the performance and characteristics of these new products from the heads of these factories.

At 3:00 p.m., Vice Chairmen of the CPC Central Committee Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, and General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, as well as members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee also visited these new products. Vice Chairman Zhu De and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Li Fuchun also rode in the Jinggangshan brand sedan, driving around the lawn for a week.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: China’s first Hongqi brand universal chassis tractor has been successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. On the 20th, this tractor, equipped with a combine harvester, underwent preliminary field trials harvesting wheat at the Beijing Southern Suburb Farm, proving that its performance basically meets the design requirements.

This new type of tractor was designed by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and it has only a few years of development history even abroad. In 1956, the factory's chief engineer saw that foreign countries were researching this type of tractor when he went abroad for inspection. Although he had introduced it at the factory after returning to China, the workers at the time did not dare to imagine that they could manufacture it themselves. During the Double-Anti Movement, the workers overcame their feelings of inferiority and decided to design this tractor themselves. They analyzed the advantages of some of the more advanced tractors in various countries, and with the support of units such as the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, designed it within three months.

This tractor has many advantages: First, it is widely used and has a high utilization rate. It can harvest 23 kinds of grains such as wheat, as well as crops such as potatoes, oilseeds, and pasture, and can carry out spraying, dusting, and chaff cutting, as well as tillage and transportation operations that ordinary universal tractors can perform. Second, the body is light and compact. It has a total of 28 horsepower, but the total weight is only 1,170 kilograms, with a weight per horsepower of 41.8 kilograms (generally, tractors weigh about 45 to 50 kilograms per horsepower). Third, using this tractor to mount various agricultural implements can eliminate the frame, wheels, and most of the transmission mechanism of the implements, thus saving a lot of steel and reducing costs. Fourth, the agricultural implements mounted on the tractor are integrated with the chassis, thus making various agricultural implements automatic, with a clear line of sight, easy operation, and flexible turning. Because of these advantages, it is very popular in rural areas, and orders from all over the country have reached 480,000 units.

When the workers in the factory's machine repair workshop received the trial production task, their enthusiasm was extremely high, and they immediately organized a trial production team. Since the workshop did not have an assembly site, a simple bamboo shed was temporarily set up. Some parts did not have blueprints, so technicians and veteran workers researched and created them, and substitutes were used when materials were lacking. After a month of hard work, this tractor was manufactured.

The factory will now also begin modifying the design based on the trial production of the first universal chassis tractor. The workers have expressed that they will overcome the existing shortcomings in a short period of time and trial-produce a more perfect and finalized Hongqi brand universal chassis tractor.

In addition, a universal tractor suitable for deep plowing and medium cultivation and the Julong brand tractor have also recently been successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Yongding Machinery Factory and the Xingping Machinery Factory, respectively.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory successfully trial-produced the "Jinggangshan" brand sedan on the 20th. This four-wheeled, five-seater sedan, from the body, engine, carburetor to every small part, is entirely domestically produced.

On the afternoon of the 20th, the workers of the First Automobile Accessories Factory beat gongs and drums and drove the sedan to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to report the good news. Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, received the workers who reported the good news and rode in the car for a week on Taijichang Road.

The workers of the First Automobile Accessories Factory put forward the slogan "If we can manufacture automobile accessories, we can manufacture automobiles" in early May this year, overcame various difficulties, and spent only two and a half months from design to production, forty days ahead of the original plan. During the trial production process, more than 100 professors and students from Tsinghua University gave great help, and more than 30 factories in Beijing and many cities across the country provided enthusiastic support and close cooperation.

### 首都制成万能底盘拖拉机和小轿车  毛主席和中央领导同志参观新产品

    首都制成万能底盘拖拉机和小轿车
    毛主席和中央领导同志参观新产品
    新华社20日讯　毛泽东主席今天下午七时在中南海参观了北京第一汽车附件厂制造的井冈山牌小轿车、兴平机械厂制造的巨龙牌拖拉机和北京农业机械厂制造的红旗牌万能底盘拖拉机，并且向这几家工厂的负责人详细询问了这些新产品的性能和特点。
    下午三时，中共中央副主席刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云和总书记邓小平，以及在场的中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记们也参观了这些新产品。朱德副主席和中共中央政治局委员李富春还乘坐井冈山牌小轿车，在草坪上绕行一周。
    新华社讯　我国第一台红旗牌万能底盘拖拉机已由北京农业机械厂试制成功。20日这台拖拉机装着一套联合收割机，在北京南郊农场作了收割小麦的田间初步试验，证明它的性能基本上合乎设计要求。
    这台新型的拖拉机，是北京农业机械厂设计的，它在国外也只有几年的发展历史。1956年，这个厂的总工程师出国考察时见到国外正在研究这种拖拉机，回国后虽曾在工厂作过介绍，但职工们当时却不敢想像能由自己来制造。在双反运动中，职工们打掉自卑感，决定自己设计这种拖拉机。他们分析了各国一些比较先进的拖拉机的优点，在农业研究所等单位的支持下，在三个月内就设计出来了。
    这种拖拉机有许多优点：一、是用途广泛，利用率高。它既能收割麦子等二十三种谷物和薯类、油料、牧草等作物，进行喷雾、喷粉、铡草等工作，又能作一般万能拖拉机所能作的耕作和运输作业。二、是机身轻巧。它共有二十八马力，但总重量只一千一百七十公斤，每马力体重为四十一点八公斤（一般拖拉机每马力约重四十五到五十公斤）。三、是用这种拖拉机装置各种农具，可以省掉农具的机架、轮子及大部分传动机构，因而大量节约了钢材，降低了成本。四、是拖拉机上装置的农具和底盘联成一体，因而使各种农具成了自动式的农具，视线清楚，操作方便，转弯灵活。由于有这些优点，它很受农村欢迎，现在各地要求订购已达四十八万台。
    这个厂的机修车间职工在接到试制任务时，情绪极为高涨，他们立即组织了试制小组。车间没有装配场所，就临时搭一个简陋的竹棚，有些零件没有图纸，就由技术人员和老工人研究创造，缺乏材料就用代用品。经过一个月的苦干，这台拖拉机就制造出来了。
    这个厂现在还要根据第一台万能底盘拖拉机试制的情况，着手修改设计。职工们表示要在短时期内克服现存的一些缺点，试制出更完善的定型的红旗牌万能底盘拖拉机。
    另外，还有一种适于深耕和中耕的万能拖拉机和巨龙牌拖拉机，最近也分别在北京永定机械厂和兴平机械厂试制成功。
    据新华社讯　北京第一汽车附件厂20日试制成功“井冈山”牌小轿车。这部四轮五座的小轿车，从车身、发动机、化油器到每一个小零件，全部是国产的。
    20日下午，第一汽车附件厂的职工敲锣打鼓，开着这部小轿车到中共北京市委、市工会联合会报喜。中共北京市委第一书记彭真接待了报喜的职工，并且乘坐这辆汽车，在台基厂马路上行驶一周。
    第一汽车附件厂职工，在今年5月初提出了“能够制造汽车附件，就能够制造汽车”的口号，克服了种种困难，从设计造型到制成，只用了两个半月时间，比原计划提前了四十天。在试制过程中，清华大学一百多个教授和学生给了极大的帮助，北京以及全国许多城市的三十多个工厂给予热情的支援和密切配合。
