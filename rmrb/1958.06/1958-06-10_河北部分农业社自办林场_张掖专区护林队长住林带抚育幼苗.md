Xinhua News Agency report:

　　In southern Hebei Province, agricultural cooperatives are actively establishing their own tree farms. Currently, 53 tree farms have been established in mountainous areas of seven counties including Xingtai, Handan, and Yi County, and in the vast sandy wasteland areas of three counties including Daming, Wei County, and Linzhang; another 47 tree farms are expected to be completed soon.

　　These tree farms are generally built by townships or cooperatives. The forestry teams of the agricultural cooperatives live permanently in existing old temples and dilapidated houses on the mountains, or in simple sheds. They are specifically responsible for the management of existing forests and fruit trees, the cultivation of young forests, and the continuation of large-scale afforestation.

　　These tree farms run by the masses of farmers have shown great superiority from the start. The ten newly established cooperative tree farms in Wu'an County have already completed over 790 mu of seedling cultivation and land preparation, collected over 27,000 jin of tree seeds, interplanted crops in over 12,000 mu of forest land, cultivated 5,500 mu of young forests, dug over 78,000 fruit tree pits, and managed over 370,000 naturally grown small trees. The newly built "May 1st" Tree Farm of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in She County expects to earn over 21,000 yuan by the end of the year.

　　Xinhua News Agency report: Recently, over 6,000 young and strong members of agricultural cooperatives in Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu Province, formed 249 forestry teams and set off for the "Green Great Wall" shelterbelt line. They have already begun building houses and digging cave dwellings, planning to settle there permanently, reclaim wasteland, and cultivate the shelterbelt seedlings into a green Great Wall to block wind and sand.

　　To block wind and sand, Zhangye Prefecture this spring constructed "Green Great Wall" shelterbelt seedlings along the Great Wall line from Dunhuang in the west to the Tengger Desert in the east. After the seedlings were planted, they were not easy to survive due to wind and sand and drought. The current activity to protect and cultivate the growth of shelterbelt seedlings is to solve this problem.

### 河北部分农业社自办林场  张掖专区护林队长住林带抚育幼苗

　　河北部分农业社自办林场
    张掖专区护林队长住林带抚育幼苗
    据新华社讯　河北省南部地区农业社纷纷自办林场。目前已在邢台、邯郸、易县等七个县的山区和大名、魏县、临漳三个县的大片沙荒地带建立起了五十三个林场；还有四十七个林场最近就可以建成。
    这些林场一般都是以乡、社为单位兴建的。农业社的林业队利用山上原有的古庙和破房，或搭盖起简陋的房子，长期居住下来，专门负责对现有林木、果树的经营管理，幼林抚育和继续进行大面积造林等工作。
    这种由农民群众自办的林场，一开始就显示了极大的优越性。武安县新建的十处合作社林场，已经完成育苗整地七百九十多亩、采集树种二万七千多斤、在林地混种农作物一万二千多亩、抚育幼林五千五百亩、刨果树坪七万八千多个、管理天然生小树三十七万多株，涉县曙光农业社新建的“五一”林场，到年底要收入二万一千多元。
    据新华社讯　甘肃省张掖专区各农业社最近有六千多个青壮年社员组成二百四十九个护林队，出发到“绿色长城”林带线上去。他们已开始修房挖窑洞，打算在那里长期安家立业，开荒种植，以便把林带幼苗抚育成绿色长城，挡住风沙。
    张掖专区为了挡住风沙，今春在西起敦煌东到腾格里大沙漠的长城沿线，营造了“绿色长城”林带幼苗。幼苗营造起来以后，因为风沙弥漫，干旱缺水，不容易成活。现在展开保护和培育林带幼苗生长的活动，就是为了解决这个问题。
