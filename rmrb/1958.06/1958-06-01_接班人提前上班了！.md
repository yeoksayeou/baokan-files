　　The successors are starting work early!
　　Qin Shu
　　Everyone says it, everyone mentions it, learn from Gou Diu.
　　Gou Diu is only twelve this year, he creates happiness for us,
　　Using his brain, offering ideas, creating a double-barreled water pump.
　　…………
　　The above doggerel is composed by members of the Xinlu No. 2 Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, for Zhang Gou Diu, a Young Pioneer in their cooperative. This Young Pioneer created a single-wheel double-cylinder waterwheel, "formerly irrigating four mu a day, now irrigating seventeen mu a day," "Don't look down on Gou Diu for being young, he has given us great ideas!"
　　Children like Zhang Gou Diu, and good ideas like the double-cylinder waterwheel, are everywhere in this socialist Great Leap Forward. Young Pioneers in Tianjin collect scrap steel to smelt a furnace of "Red Scarf" steel; two million teenagers and children in Zhejiang planted 70 million castor bean and sunflower plants... It's truly endless to talk about and impossible to count.
　　The children are absolutely unwilling to be bystanders in the socialist construction of the motherland, they also want to get involved. And they do it as soon as they say it, without any hesitation. Aren't so many large and small "Red Scarf Reservoirs" scattered across the land of the motherland? Haven't hundreds of millions of saplings grown under the cultivation and protection of the children? In the activities of eliminating the four pests, planting trees, and promoting Mandarin, haven't the teenagers and children already shown their strength as a vital force in socialist construction? On the streets of the cities, we can see Young Pioneers publicizing hygiene every day; in the countryside, Red Scarves are all over the fields and hills. Aren't people singing? "Young children compete with Luo Cheng," in fact, today's young children have long surpassed Luo Cheng by far.
　　What does all this illustrate?
　　All this illustrates one fact: the communist successors have started working early.
　　The successors come to work early, participating together while the previous shift hasn't ended, this shows that our socialist Great Leap Forward has become a national revolutionary movement, indicating that our next generation will greatly surpass their predecessors in both thought and spirit. They are courageous and forward-thinking, and also have a kind of irresistible momentum. This is really incredibly inspiring, making us feel proud and honored for our country and nation.
　　Some people say: "Isn't this a bit too much? Children are, after all, children, they should still study and stay at home." This statement, ostensibly showing concern, is actually disheartening. The children's participation in socialist construction not only does not affect their studies, on the contrary, they are learning more and better. Because their studies and their activities are linked to the national revolutionary struggle, they can absorb nourishment from such a rich university from an early age and receive a profound communist education. Can their future still be limited? In the era of their growth, they can not only catch up with Britain, but also overtake the United States. Is there any doubt about this?
　　Our descendants are such remarkable descendants!
　　The waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves, a new generation surpasses the old. Let us cheer for our successors! Let us care for them, help them, and educate them a hundred times more, because this is a very important undertaking in our socialist construction cause—the undertaking of building "people"!

### 接班人提前上班了！

　　接班人提前上班了！
　　秦澍
    人人说，人人提，要向狗丢来学习。
    狗丢今年才十二，他为咱们造福气，
    动脑筋，出主意，创造双筒抽水机。
    ………… 
    上面这段快板，乃是河南省长葛县新路二社社员为他们社里的少先队员张狗丢编的。这个少先队员创造了单轮双筒水车，“从前一天浇四亩，如今一天浇十七”，“别看狗丢年纪小，他为咱们出的好主意！”
    像张狗丢这样的孩子，像双筒水车这样的好主意，在这次社会主义大跃进里，到处都有。天津少先队员收集废钢铁，要炼一炉“红领巾”钢；浙江两百万少年儿童种了七千万株蓖麻和向日葵。……真是说不完也数不清。
    孩子们决不愿意在祖国的社会主义建设里做旁观者，他们也要动手干。而且说做就做，一点不含糊。那么多大大小小的“红领巾水库”不是星罗棋布地出现在祖国的大地上了吗？数以亿计的树苗不是在孩子们的栽培保护下成长了吗？在除四害、种树和推广普通话的活动中，少年儿童不是已经显示了他们的作为社会主义建设一支生力军的力量了吗？在城市的街头，我们每天能看到少先队员在宣传卫生，在农村，红领巾遍布在田野和山岗上。人们不是唱着吗？“少年儿童赛罗成”，其实，今天的少年儿童们早就远远地赛过罗成了。
    这一切说明什么呢？
    这一切说明了一个事实：共产主义接班人已经提前上班了。
    接班人在上一班还没有下班的时候，就提前来上班，参加一起搞，这是说明我们的社会主义大跃进已经成为全民性的革命运动，说明我们的下一代无论在思想上或是在气魄上都会大大超过他们的前辈，他们勇往直前，也有着一种破竹之势。这实在是叫人无比振奋，引以为我们国家民族的光荣和骄傲的。
    有人说：“这未免太过份了吧？孩子终究是孩子，还是该读读书，在家里好好待着才是。”这说法，名为关心，其实是泄气。孩子们参加社会主义建设，不但没有影响他们的学习，恰相反，他们学习得更多更好了。因为他们的学习，他们的活动，都跟全民性的革命斗争联系起来，从小就能够从这么丰富的大学校中吸收养料，受到深刻的共产主义教育，他们的前途还能限量吗？在他们成长的年代里，不仅可以赶过英国，而且能赶过美国，这难道还有什么怀疑的吗？
    我们的后代，是多么了不起的后代！
    长江后浪推前浪，一代新人胜旧人。让我们为我们的接班人欢呼吧！让我们更加百倍地关心他们，帮助他们，教育他们，因为这是我们的社会主义建设事业中的一个十分重要的事业——建设“人”的事业！
