Our country will build over ten thousand small and medium-sized blast furnaces within a year.
    Iron production capacity will exceed 20 million tons

    (Our report) An unprecedented mass movement to build small blast furnaces for iron smelting is emerging nationwide. Twenty-four provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will establish over ten thousand small and medium-sized blast furnaces with volumes ranging from three to two hundred and fifty-five cubic meters within a year. The production capacity of these blast furnaces will exceed 20 million tons.

    "Without iron, nothing can be achieved." Inspired by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, China's labor force of 600 million people has launched a movement to extract steel from the earth. Since the beginning of this year, hundreds of newly built small blast furnaces have been put into production in various regions, and experience has been gained. Now, Hebei, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong have all decided to build more than one thousand small blast furnaces each, most of which can be completed this year. Even in remote Xinjiang, isolated Qinghai, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia, which has never produced a ton of iron before, hundreds of small blast furnaces will produce molten iron this year.

    At the local metallurgical conference convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in April this year, various regions planned to produce more than 2 million tons of pig iron this year. Just over a month later, according to the statistics from the recent second local metallurgical conference this year, with the successive commissioning of a large number of newly built small blast furnaces, local industries (excluding enterprises originally under the central government and transferred to local control) are confident of producing more than 4 million tons of pig iron this year, ten times the output of last year.

    While accelerating the construction of large-scale iron and steel complexes, vigorously developing local small and medium-sized blast furnaces can enable China to achieve a leap in iron and steel production with minimal investment in the shortest possible time and catch up with Britain. This batch of small and medium-sized blast furnaces with a total production capacity of over 20 million tons is equivalent to forty large blast furnaces with a volume of 1,000 cubic meters. If we only rely on the construction of large-scale blast furnaces, the investment will be many times greater, and the time will be extended for many years.

    Small blast furnaces are simple in equipment and easy to build. The Qianghua Iron Plant in Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan, used 700 yuan of funds and used waste materials to build a small blast furnace with a volume of 1.8 cubic meters in seven days, producing 400 tons of pig iron annually. The vast majority of the 400 small blast furnaces planned to be newly built in Sichuan Province this year will use locally abundant natural sand and gravel to build the furnace shell and lining. Each blast furnace with a volume of 15 cubic meters only costs about 10,000 yuan. The part of this type of blast furnace above the belly can be used continuously for ten years, and the belly and hearth parts (built with refractory bricks) can be used continuously for one to one and a half years. In addition to building ten small blast furnaces with mechanical equipment this year, Xinjiang also plans to build one hundred indigenous blast furnaces. The construction cost of this type of blast furnace is only 80 yuan per cubic meter of volume on average, and it can produce qualified foundry pig iron.

    The significance of building small blast furnaces everywhere for the development of China's national economy cannot be expressed in numbers. People point out that the economic value of adding one million tons of pig iron in Anshan and in remote areas that never produce a ton of pig iron is incomparable. Therefore, the construction of this batch of small and medium-sized blast furnaces not only enables China to increase 20 million tons of pig iron with little investment in a short period of time, but more importantly, it will fundamentally change the distribution of iron and steel production in China. In the future, it will no longer be only a few bases that produce iron and steel. New iron and steel bases will be established in all provinces and regions across the country. Arrangements have already been made to establish hundreds of small steelmaking converters and a number of steel processing plants, and some have already begun construction. In this way, relying on locally produced iron and steel, the development needs of agriculture and other industries can be met, greatly promoting the accelerated development of socialist construction in various parts of the country.

    Building small blast furnaces everywhere also makes extensive use of the scattered and fragmented iron ore resources in more than half of China's counties. These scattered small mines are often high-grade rich ores, which can be used as sideline production by agricultural cooperatives, and mined manually, thus eliminating the need for investment in mining and beneficiation equipment.

### 我国一年内将建设上万座中小型高炉  产铁能力超过二千万吨

　　我国一年内将建设上万座中小型高炉
    产铁能力超过二千万吨
    本报讯　在全国范围内正在出现一个史无前例的建设炼铁小高炉的全民运动，二十四个省、市、自治区将在一年内建立起上万个容积从三立方公尺到二百五十五立方公尺的中小型高炉，这批高炉的生产能力将超过二千万吨。
    “手无寸铁，一事无成”，我国六亿人口组成的劳动大军在党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，展开了向地球要钢铁的运动。今年以来，各地已经有几百座新建的小高炉投入生产，取得了经验。现在，河北、安徽、河南、山东都已经决定各建一千多座小高炉，大部分可以在今年建成。连在边远的新疆，偏僻的青海、甘肃，以及从来不出一吨铁的内蒙古，今年也将有几百座小高炉流出火红的铁水。
    在冶金工业部今年4月间召开的地方冶金会议上，各地计划今年生产生铁二百多万吨，仅仅一个多月以后，根据最近召开的今年第二次地方冶金会议的统计，由于大批新建的小高炉陆续投入生产，今年地方工业（不包括原属中央的下放企业）有把握生产四百多万吨生铁，十倍于去年的产量。
    在加快建设大型钢铁联合企业的同时，大量发展地方中小型高炉，可以使我国在最短的时间内以很少的投资实现钢铁生产的飞跃发展，赶上英国。这一批总生产能力达二千万吨以上的中小型高炉，相当于容积一千立方公尺的大型高炉四十座。如果单靠建设大型高炉，投资要大好多倍，时间要延长好多年。
    小高炉设备简单，建造容易。四川乐山专区强华铁厂以七百元资金利用废旧材料在七天时间内建成一座容积一点八立方公尺的小高炉，年产生铁四百吨。今年四川省计划新建的四百座小高炉，绝大部分将采用当地盛产的天然砂石砌筑炉壳、炉衬，每座容积十五立方公尺的高炉只需一万元左右。这种高炉，炉腹以上部分可以连续使用十年，炉腹和炉缸部分（用耐火砖砌）可以连续使用一年到一年半。新疆今年计划除新建十座有机械设备的小高炉外，还将建造一百座土高炉，这种高炉的建设费用平均每立方公尺容积只需八十元，能炼出合格的铸造生铁。
    遍地建设小高炉对于我国发展国民经济的意义，是无法用数字来表达的。人们指出：同样增加一百万吨生铁，在鞍山和在从来不出一吨生铁的偏远的地区，其经济价值是不能比拟的。因此，这批中小高炉的建设不仅使我国在短时期内以很少投资增加二千万吨生铁，更重要的是：它将根本上改变我国钢铁生产的分布状况，今后不再是只有少数几个基地生产钢铁，全国各省区都将建立起新的钢铁基地，目前已经作出了建立数以百计的炼钢小转炉和一批钢材加工厂的安排，有的已经动手建设。这样，可以依靠当地生产的钢铁，供应农业和其他工业的发展需要，大大促进全国各地社会主义建设事业的加速发展。
    遍地建设小高炉，又广泛地利用了我国半数以上的县都有的分散零星的铁矿资源。这些分散的小矿，往往都是品位较高的富矿，可以作为农业社的副业生产，手工开采，因此不需耗费矿山和选矿设备的投资。
