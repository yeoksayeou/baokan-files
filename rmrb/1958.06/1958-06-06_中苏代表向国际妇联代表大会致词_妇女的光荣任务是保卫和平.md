Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 4th: Vienna dispatch: The International Democratic Women's Federation Congress held its second plenary session on the afternoon of the 3rd.

　　Zhang Yun, head of the Chinese women's delegation and vice-chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting.

　　Zhang Yun said that the International Democratic Women's Federation has always advocated defending peace, women's rights, and children's happiness. This is also the common wish of women and mothers all over the world. This congress convened by the International Democratic Women's Federation to achieve these goals is another manifestation of the solidarity of women all over the world. She pointed out that if we want to fight for women's rights and children's happiness, we must first defend peace.

　　She added that the current situation is favorable for the people of the world to achieve further victories in the struggle for peace, democracy, and national independence. However, the American aggressive bloc will never voluntarily abandon its policies of expanding armaments and preparing for war and colonialism. It will continue to create tension, conduct nuclear tests, and threaten the peace and security of mankind. She said: Therefore, I fully support Mrs. Gordon.

　　Zhang Yun then talked about the efforts made by the Chinese people and Chinese women to defend peace, about how the Chinese people are diligently and bravely engaged in peaceful construction, and about the role Chinese women are playing and the creativity they are showing in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. She emphasized that Chinese women cherish the rights they have already obtained, and therefore feel the preciousness and importance of peace.

　　In her speech, Zhang Yun expressed her firm support for the heroic struggles and legitimate demands of the people of all countries who are fighting for national independence, against imperialist interference, and for the peaceful reunification of their motherlands.

　　Zhang Yun concluded by saying that defending peace and striving for the realization of lasting peace is a glorious task placed before women. As long as we work together, we will surely win greater victories in the cause of peace.

　　Delegates applauded enthusiastically at the end of Zhang Yun's speech.

Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: TASS Vienna dispatch: The Fourth Congress of the International Democratic Women's Federation continued to hold plenary sessions on the 3rd and 4th to discuss the report of the President of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Mrs. Gordon.

　　At the plenary session on the morning of the 4th, Popova, head of the Soviet women's delegation and chairman of the Presidium of the Soviet Women's Committee, delivered a speech.

　　Popova first pointed out that the formation of a powerful socialist camp with a population of 900 million and the rise of the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa are new factors that have a significant impact on the international situation. She then described the practical measures taken by the Soviet government to prevent war and to establish friendly and good-neighborly relations with all countries. Popova called on women all over the world to fight for the elimination of the "Cold War" and the arms race, to prevent the atomic threat, and to defend children's right to life. She said: "We demand that all governments immediately stop testing nuclear weapons; we expect the United States and Britain to follow the example of the Soviet Union."

　　Popova also said that it is very important for women of all countries to demand that a summit conference between East and West be convened quickly to pass resolutions to ease international tensions.

　　Popova concluded by calling on all women's organizations, women's movements, and all women's groups to actively support the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation to be held in Stockholm in July this year.

　　中苏代表向国际妇联代表大会致词
    妇女的光荣任务是保卫和平
    据新华社布拉格4日电　维也纳消息：国际民主妇女联合会代表大会3日下午举行了第二次全体会议。
    中国妇女代表团团长、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席章蕴在这次会议上讲了话。
    章蕴说，国际民主妇女联合会一向主张保卫和平、妇女的权利和儿童的幸福。这也是全世界妇女和母亲们的共同愿望。国际民主妇女联合会为了实现这些目的而召开的这次代表大会是全世界妇女团结的又一表现。她指出，如果我们要为妇女的权利和儿童的幸福而奋斗的话，我们就必须首先保卫和平。
    她又说，目前的形势有利于全世界人民在争取和平、民主和民族独立的斗争中取得进一步的胜利。但是，美国侵略集团绝不会自愿地放弃扩军备战和殖民主义的政策，它要继续制造紧张局势，进行核试验，威胁人类的和平和安全。她说：因此，我完全支持戈登夫人。
    章蕴接着谈到中国人民和中国妇女为保卫和平所作的努力，谈到中国人民怎样勤劳勇敢地努力从事于和平建设，并且谈到中国妇女在工农业生产大跃进中所发挥的作用和她们所表现出来的创造性。她强调指出，中国妇女珍视自己已得的权利，因此就特别感觉到和平的可贵与重要。
    章蕴在她的发言中表示坚决支持正在为争取民族独立、反对帝国主义干涉和争取和平统一自己的祖国而奋斗的各国人民的英勇斗争和正当要求。
    章蕴最后说，保卫和平和争取持久和平的实现是摆在妇女面前的光荣任务。只要我们共同努力，我们一定能够赢得和平事业的更大胜利。
    在章蕴的发言结束的时候，代表们热烈鼓掌。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：国际民主妇女联合会第四次代表大会3日和4日继续举行全体会议，讨论国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人的报告。
    在3日会议上发言的有法国、意大利、德意志民主共和国、德意志联邦共和国、中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚、厄瓜多尔和以色列的代表。到会者并且怀着激动的心情听取了阿尔及利亚的代表香图叙述阿尔及利亚的情况。
    在4日上午的全体会议上，苏联妇女代表团团长、苏联妇女委员会主席团主席波波娃发了言。
    波波娃首先指出，拥有九亿人口的强大社会主义阵营的形成和亚非国家民族解放运动的兴起是对国际局势具有重大影响的新因素。她接着叙述了苏联政府为了防止战争和为了同各国建立友好睦邻关系所采取的实际措施。波波娃呼吁全世界的妇女为消除“冷战”和军备竞赛，防止原子威胁，捍卫孩子们的生活权利而斗争。她说：“我们要求各国政府立即停止试验核武器；我们期待着美国和英国也效法苏联的榜样。”
    波波娃还说，各国妇女都应该要求迅速召开东西方最高级会议，通过缓和国际紧张局势的决议，这是非常重要的。
    波波娃最后呼吁一切妇女组织、妇女运动和一切妇女团体积极地支持定在今年7月在斯德哥尔摩召开的争取裁军和国际合作大会。
    在4日会议上发言的还有伊拉克、英国、突尼斯、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、希腊和墨西哥等国家的妇女代表。
