Wuxing County Agricultural Science Research Institute Produces Artificial Fertilizer Locally

(Reported by this newspaper) The Wuxing County Agricultural Science Research Institute, the first county-run institute of its kind in Zhejiang Province, has developed several scientific technologies of great practical value for current agricultural production within ten days of its establishment.

After its establishment, the County Agricultural Science Research Institute immediately focused on researching and producing artificial fertilizers using local materials, developing indigenous methods to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, and trial-manufacturing water lifting tools, based on current production needs. They successfully trial-produced artificial fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate and calcium sulfate using clam shells and snail shells. These fertilizers are highly effective, and some have already begun mass production.

After discussions and research with leading cadres, technicians, and traditional Chinese medicine peddlers, the institute identified twenty-three kinds of wild herbs that can kill insects. They are preparing to use these herbs extensively in indigenous methods to prevent and control early rice plant diseases and insect pests. They are also researching the local production of tobacco agents, 666, and other insecticides. After absorbing the opinions of handicraft technical workers, they also successfully trial-produced water lifting tools such as propeller pumps.

Currently, they are formulating a county-wide agricultural scientific research plan based on the county's needs for developing production. (Yi Xintian)

    吴兴县农业科学研究所
    就地取材生产人造肥料
    本报讯　浙江省第一所县办的吴兴县农业科学研究所成立后十天，就研究出多项对当前农业生产有很大实用价值的科学技术。
    这个县农科所成立后，立即根据当前生产需要，就地取材研究出人造肥料，用土办法防治病虫害和试制提水工具等题目。利用蚌壳、螺蛳壳试制成功了碳酸铵、硫酸钙等人造肥料，这些肥料肥效很高，目前有的已开始大量生产。
    所里领导干部、技术人员和卖中药郎中等座谈研究后，找出了二十三种能杀虫的野生草药，正准备大量利用土办法防治早稻病虫害，同时还研究出就地取材生产烟药剂、六六六等杀虫剂。在吸收了手工业技术工人的意见后，还试制成功了螺旋桨水泵等提水工具。
    目前他们正在根据全县发展生产需要制订全县农业科学研究计划。　（伊心恬）
