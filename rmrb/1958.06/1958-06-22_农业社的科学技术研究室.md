    Agricultural Cooperative's Science and Technology Research Laboratory
    The Nongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, has established an agricultural science and technology research laboratory, engaging in scientific research work in conjunction with agricultural production. Now, in the fields of this cooperative, one can see markers for experimental fields of crops such as sorghum, soybeans, millet, and sugar beets. They are also carrying out various activities such as cultivating improved seeds and grafting fruit trees.
    Eighty-four cooperative members participate in this research laboratory, forming eleven scientific and technological research groups specializing in: crop cultivation, seed breeding, soil and fertilizer, agricultural machinery and tools, pest and disease control, water conservancy and aquaculture, forestry, animal husbandry breeding, animal epidemic prevention, pig production, and fruit tree horticulture. The laboratory is equipped with simple instruments and specimens. Members regularly conduct research, study agricultural scientific knowledge, and transmit techniques here, and take the research laboratory as the center to mobilize all members to make a great leap forward in agricultural science. Their slogan is: "Men, women, old, and young, with one heart, make a great leap forward towards science, reform technology to create, dare to think and dare to innovate."
    Some members of this cooperative had previously conducted various grafting experiments. In the agricultural technology revolution, the members urgently demanded to learn agricultural science and technology. Based on this situation, the Party branch of this cooperative, with the help of the county and township work teams, established an agricultural science and technology research laboratory, and absorbed fifteen people including elderly farmers, middle and primary school botany teachers, and middle and primary school graduates to form an agricultural science and technology committee to lead the work of the research laboratory.

    农业社的科学技术研究室
    黑龙江省双城县农丰农业社建立了农业科学技术研究室，结合农业生产从事科学研究工作。现在，这个社的田野里，到处可以看到标明着高粱、大豆、谷子、甜菜等作物试验田的标桩，同时开展了各种培育良种、嫁接果树等活动。
    这个研究室有八十四个社员参加，分别组成：作物栽培、种子繁育、土壤肥料、机械农具、病虫灾害、水利水产、林业、畜牧饲养繁殖、畜牧防疫、生猪生产、果树园艺等十一个科学技术研究小组。试验室内设有简易的仪器和标本。社员定期在这里进行研究、学习农业科学知识和技术传授等活动，并以研究室为中心，发动全体社员向农业科学大进军。他们的口号是：“男女老少一条心，向着科学大进军，改革技术要创造，敢想敢干要革新”。
    这个社有些社员，过去就进行各种嫁接试验研究的活动。在农业技术改革中，社员们迫切要求学习农业科学技术。根据这种情况，这个社的党支部在县乡工作组的帮助下，建立了农业科学技术研究室，并吸收了老年农民，中、小学校植物教师，中、小学毕业生等十五人参加组成农业科学技术委员会，领导研究室的工作。
