Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: The Japanese Peace Congress held in Tokyo successfully concluded on the 15th. The congress passed a declaration calling on the Japanese people to unite and join hands with the people of all countries in the world to launch a struggle to prevent Japan from being armed with nuclear weapons, to realize Asia as a nuclear-weapon-free zone, to immediately and unconditionally stop all nuclear weapons tests, and to promote the immediate convening of an East-West summit conference.
　　The congress passed a resolution "Regarding Opening Up Japan-China Relations." The resolution pointed out that the deterioration of Japan-China relations is inseparable from the Kishi Nobusuke government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, and its active implementation of a nuclear armament policy to establish a military system to encircle China.
　　The resolution demanded that the Japanese government change its hostile attitude toward China, immediately take effective measures to fully implement the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement, sincerely resolve the Liu Lianren incident, and apologize to China for the insult to the Chinese national flag. The resolution also demanded the abolition of the so-called "Japan-Taiwan Treaty" to promote the early restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. The resolution firmly stated that it would fight to the end to change the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile policy toward China and to shatter the threat of atomic war, which is inseparable from it.
　　The congress decided to hold a "Month for Preventing Nuclear Armament of Japan and Safeguarding Democracy" from June 20th to July 20th.
　　In the resolution "Regarding the Okinawa Issue" passed by the congress, the government was asked to immediately negotiate with the U.S. government on the issue of returning Okinawa to Japan.
　　The congress also passed an appeal, calling on the Japanese working class to unite and launch a struggle to safeguard peace.
　　In the name of all participants, the congress sent telegrams of encouragement to the Wakayama Prefecture Teachers' Union, the Somagahara Farmers' Rally, and other Japanese workers' and farmers' organizations engaged in heroic struggles, as well as to the peoples of Sudan and Algeria fighting for national liberation.
　　The congress passed resolutions supporting the "Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation and the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament," as well as the proposals submitted by the Japanese Peace Congress to the Stockholm Conference, and elected a 68-member Japanese delegation headed by Yoshitaro Hirano.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 16th: Representatives of the National Conference of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs today petitioned both houses of the Japanese Diet, demanding a ban on arming Japan with nuclear weapons and urging the United States and Britain to immediately halt nuclear weapons testing.
　　More than 150 representatives from various prefectures and victim groups attended the meeting.
　　The representatives handed petitions with the same content to the speakers of both houses of the Diet, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, and the ambassadors of the United States and Britain to Japan.
　　The petition criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government for violating its repeated promises not to bring nuclear weapons into Japan and not to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, and has yet to take concrete measures to fulfill these promises. The petition stated that if Japan is drawn into the vortex of an atomic war that may occur in the future and becomes a battlefield, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for this.
　　The petition called on the Diet to urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to immediately take effective measures and actions to realize the following: urging the United States and Britain to follow the Soviet Union's example and immediately stop all nuclear weapons tests, and requiring the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to immediately conclude regulations prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons; prohibiting the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan and Okinawa and the establishment of nuclear weapons bases; immediately concluding an agreement with the U.S. government not to bring nuclear weapons into Japan; stopping the arming of the "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons, declaring at home and abroad Japan's determination not to carry out nuclear armament, and passing a declaration of Japan's non-nuclear armament in the Diet.
　　The meeting also decided that from June 20th, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs would hold a peaceful march of 1,000 kilometers between Hiroshima and Tokyo; and on July 20th, peaceful marches would be held in various prefectures.

    日本和平大会胜利闭幕
    号召人民阻止日本核武装
    要岸信介政府改变敌视中国态度
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：在东京举行的日本和平大会已经在15日胜利闭幕。大会通过一项宣言号召日本人民团结一致，同世界各国人民携起手来展开斗争，阻止用核武器武装日本，实现亚洲为无核武器地区、立即无条件停止一切核武器试验，并且促使立即召开东西方首脑会议。
    大会通过了“关于打通日中关系”的决议。决议指出，日中关系的恶化是和岸信介政府勾结台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜李承晚集团，积极执行核武装政策，以建立包围中国的军事体系的企图分不开的。
    决议要求日本政府改变敌视中国的态度，立即采取有效措施使第四次日中贸易协定能够完全付诸实施，有诚意地解决刘连仁事件，并且对侮辱中国国旗事件向中国谢罪。决议还要求废弃所谓“日台条约”，以促使早日恢复日中两国的正常邦交和恢复中国在联合国的正当席位。决议坚决表示，将为改变岸信介政府敌视中国的政策和粉碎与此不可分割的原子战争威胁而斗争到底。
    大会决定从6月20日到7月20日举行“阻止核武装日本与维护民主主义月”。
    在大会通过的“关于冲绳问题”的决议中要求政府立即就把冲绳归还日本的问题同美国政府进行谈判。
    大会还通过一项呼吁，呼吁日本工人阶级联合起来为维护和平而展开斗争。
    大会以全体与会者的名义分别致电勉励正在展开英勇斗争的和歌山县教职员工会、相马原农民大会等日本工人、农民组织和苏丹、阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族解放的斗争。
    大会通过了支持“关于争取裁军与国际合作大会和第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会”的决议，以及日本和平大会向斯德哥尔摩大会提出的议案，并且选出了以平野义太郎为团长的，由六十八人组成的日本代表团。
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会全国代表会议的代表今天分别向日本国会两院请愿，要求禁止用核武器武装日本，并且促使美英两国立即停止核武器试验。
    来自各都、道、府、县和受害团体代表一百五十多人出席了这个会议。
    代表们分别把同样内容的请愿书交给两院议长和政府官房长官以及美、英两国驻日本的大使。
    请愿书指责岸信介政府违背自己曾经屡次表明过的“不把核武器运进日本境内”和“不以核武器武装日本”的诺言，至今尚未采取实现这些诺言的具体措施。请愿书说，如果将来日本被卷进一旦发生的原子战争的旋涡而变成战场，这个责任完全应该由日本政府承担。
    请愿书要求国会促使岸信介政府为实现下列事项立即采取有效措施和行动：促使美英两国仿效苏联立即停止一切核武器试验，并且要求美、英、苏三国立即缔结禁止试验核武器的规定；禁止向日本和冲绳运进核武器和建立核武器基地；立即同美国政府缔结不把核武器运进日本的协定；停止用核武器武装“自卫队”，向国内外表明日本不进行核武装的决心，并且在国会通过日本的非核武装宣言。
    会议还决定从6月20日起，由日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会举行在广岛和东京之间一千公里的和平游行；7月20日在各都、道、府、县举行和平大游行。
