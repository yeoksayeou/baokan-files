Singing the General Line

    Red Flag Song
      Li Ji
    Don't beat the drums or clang the gongs,
    Listen to me sing a red flag song.
    The red flag is the general line,
    Hold the red flag high, happiness abounds.
    The general line is a lighthouse, red across the sky,
    Shining on the bright and clear socialist road.
    The general line is a bugle call for advancement,
    The sound of the horn shakes mountains and moves the earth.
    The general line is the red flag fluttering and flapping,
    Illuminating the hearts of the people.
    Everyone holds high the big red flag,
    Let's see who can hold it higher than the sky.
    Hold the red flag high with courage,
    Dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act.
    Fear neither heaven nor earth,
    We are the ones who will turn the world upside down!
    The red flag is the leaping-forward flag,
    Hold the red flag high and chase the sun.
    Grain must be piled into Kunlun Mountains,
    And tens of thousands of tons of steel must be smelted in the furnace.
    Everyone come and plant red flags,
    Plant them all over the plains and high mountains.
    Plant them all over the cities and villages,
    Plant the red flag in our hearts.
    The red flag is the victory flag,
    Wherever it is planted, victory follows.
    Uproot the white flag of capitalism,
    Tear down the white flag and replace it with the red flag.
    Tear down all kinds of miscellaneous flags,
    Only the red flag shall illuminate the earth.
    The red flag is the flag of happiness,
    The red flag is the flag of happy socialism.

    红旗歌
  　李季
    不要打鼓不敲锣，
    听我唱个红旗歌。
    红旗就是总路线，
    高举红旗幸福多。
    总路线是灯塔满天红，
    照得社会主义大道亮又明。
    总路线是进军号，
    号声震得山摇地皮动。
    总路线是红旗呼啦啦飘，
    把人心都照亮了。
    人人高举大红旗，
    看谁举得比天高。
    举起红旗要勇敢，
    敢想敢说又敢干。
    天不怕来地不怕，
    翻天复地要数咱！
    红旗就是跃进旗，
    高举红旗撵太阳。
    粮食要堆成昆仑山，
    炼炉里要炼出万万吨钢。
    大家都来插红旗，
    插满了平川插高山。
    城市乡村都插遍，
    红旗插到心里边。
    红旗就是胜利旗，
    插到哪里哪里就胜利。
    资本主义的白旗连根拔，
    扯下白旗换红旗。
    各色杂旗都扯掉，
    单要红旗照大地。
    红旗就是幸福旗，
    红旗就是幸福的社会主义。
