    A Salute to the Heroic People of Yu County
    The news that Yu County, Shanxi Province, relied on its own strength to build a small railway and manufacture a native-made train is truly unprecedented and unseen. This event is not only difficult for bourgeois "experts" to imagine, but also perhaps unexpected by some comrades who thought they had fully estimated the strength of the masses.
    Who doesn't know that building a railway is a major project, and manufacturing a locomotive requires a large amount of special materials and complex technology? Who doesn't know that the industrial base of our country's counties is generally very weak, and the financial, material, and technical resources are limited? How can one imagine using the strength of a county to do such a major task as building a railway? However, the cadres and masses of Yu County boldly thought and boldly acted. The rails have already been laid there, and the train has already run on them. This shows that although the strength of a county is limited, as long as we believe in the masses and mobilize the strength of the masses, we can still accomplish great things. Although this railway is short and this locomotive is small, it fully demonstrates the soaring ambition and drive of the Chinese people to vigorously develop industry, and it demonstrates the greatest strength of the people. The heroic people of Yu County have set a glorious example: even without steel rails or locomotives, they can still build a railway. Then, in realizing the great leap forward in local industry, what difficulties are insurmountable?

    向英雄的盂县人民致敬
    山西省盂县依靠自己的力量建设了小铁路、制成了土火车的新闻，真是一条闻所未闻、见所未见的新闻。这件事，不要说是资产阶级的“专家”们难以设想，就是有些以为自己已经充分估计到群众的力量的同志，恐怕也是有些意想不到的。
    谁不知道办铁路是一件大工程，造火车头更需要大量的特殊材料和复杂的技术；谁不知道我们国家的县的工业基础大都非常薄弱，财力、物力、技术力量都是有限的。怎么能够设想以一个县的力量，就来做办铁路这样的大事？但是，盂县的干部和群众大胆地想了，大胆地做了，铁轨已经铺在那儿，火车已经从上面驰过，这说明一个县的力量虽然有限，但只要相信群众，发动群众的力量，一样可以办出大事来。这条铁路虽然短，这个火车头虽然小，但是它充分表现了我国人民大办工业的冲天的志气和干劲，它表现了人民群众最伟大的力量。英雄的盂县人民做出了这个光荣的榜样，没有钢轨，没有火车头，自己也能办起铁路来，那么，在实现地方工业大跃进中，还有什么困难是不可战胜的呢？
