Villages All Set Up Granaries, Delivering Grain to Doors
Xuanhua Changes the System of Allotment by Area, Waiting at Designated Points to Sell Grain

    (Our dispatch) Based on rectification, all staff on the grain front in Xuanhua County, Hebei, guided by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, have changed the supply system of allocating areas, waiting at designated points to sell grain to a system of having granaries in every village and delivering grain to the doors. Now, the masses do not have to leave their villages to buy grain, saving a lot of labor.
    Last winter, the masses in disaster areas such as Shenjing Village reflected that the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is a life-saving policy for the working people, especially for those in disaster areas, but the supply system is a system that makes the masses run around and suffer. Based on this reflection, the county party committee further investigated among the masses and confirmed that buying grain did affect production and life for the masses in disaster areas. The Maquan Grain Station (disaster area) supplies thirteen villages with one thousand and three households, the nearest being fourteen li away and the farthest being twenty-five li away. Each household buys grain an average of eight times a month (disaster areas only buy a few jin or a dozen jin at a time). From January to August, more than 28,000 labor days were used to buy grain at the grain station. During the investigation, the masses unanimously demanded that more stations be set up to provide some convenience. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee decided to add eight grain stations in the Shenjing area, opening the granaries regularly and selling grain on a rotating basis. However, the cadres of the Grain Bureau said they were afraid of four things: afraid of increasing expenses, afraid of the masses抢粮 (qiang liang - fighting for grain, a politically charged term), afraid of cadres being corrupt, and afraid of procedures being chaotic. In short, they did not trust the masses. They reluctantly added six, which was welcomed by the masses in the disaster areas.
    Through rectification and criticism of the "four fears" ideology, grain depots were established in all 352 villages in the county in just over half a month, with grain being delivered to households without having to leave the village.
    Establishing grain depots in every village not only facilitates the masses but also represents a policy-oriented change in the entire rural supply system. From the current perspective, apart from the central grain depot, three grain cadres per township are sufficient, a 50% reduction in cadres compared to the past. For some villages with small supply volumes or only grain exchange business, it can be integrated with the commune granary, with cadres regularly opening the granaries on a rotating basis, also helping the commune granary achieve "ten withouts and six goods" and imparting scientific techniques. In this way, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is more comprehensively and concretely rooted in the hearts of the people, making grain work more specific, faster, better, and more economical to support and serve socialist construction.
    The practice of Xuanhua County has six major advantages: First, cadres can more deeply publicize and implement the grain policy; second, storage technology is brought to the countryside, helping agricultural cooperatives learn scientific storage techniques; third, they can understand the ideological situation of the masses regarding grain and the grain bottom line at any time and any place; fourth, speculation and profiteering by grain merchants and black market activities are completely blocked; fifth, grain cadres participate in central work, learn rural work methods, and integrate specialization with redness; sixth, mutual support with supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives eliminates some past wrangling.

### 村村设仓  送粮上门  宣化改变划片按点坐等售粮制度

    村村设仓  送粮上门
    宣化改变划片按点坐等售粮制度
    本报讯  在整风的基础上，河北宣化县粮食战线上的全体职工本着鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的建设社会主义的方针，把划片按点、坐等售粮的供应制度，改变为村村有仓，送粮上门的制度。现在群众买粮不出村，节省了很多人工。
    去年冬季深井等灾区村群众反映：粮食统购统销政策是劳动人民、特别是灾区人民的救命政策，可是供应制度却是群众跑路受罪制度。根据这个反映，县委在群众中进一步了解，确实灾区群众因买粮影响了生产，也影响着生活。马圈粮点（灾区）供应十三个村一千零三户人家，近的十四里，远的达二十五里，每户平均每月买八次粮（灾区一次只买几斤或十几斤），1至8月份，到粮点买粮就用了二万八千多个劳动日。调查中群众一致要求多设几个点，给些方便。县委为解决这个问题，决定在深井片增加八个粮点，定期开仓，巡回售粮。但粮食局干部说有四怕：怕增加开支，怕群众抢粮，怕干部贪污，怕手续乱。总而言之不相信群众。勉强增加了六个，结果得到灾区群众拥护。
    通过整风批判了四怕思想，半月多时间全县三百五十二个村子建立了粮仓，买粮不出村，送粮到户。
    村村设粮仓，不但便利群众，而且在整个农村供应制度上起了一种政策性的变化。从现在看，除中心粮库外，一乡设三个粮食干部即可，比原来减少干部50％。有些村供应量小或只有交换粮业务，可与社仓统一起来，干部定期巡回开仓，也帮助社仓做到“十无六好”，传授科学技术。这样粮食统销政策更全面具体深入人心，使粮食工作更具体地做得多快好省，来支持与服务于社会主义建设。
    宣化县的做法，现在看来有六大好处：一、干部更能深入地宣传贯彻粮食政策；二、保管技术下了乡，帮助农业社学会科学的保管技术；三、能随时随地摸清群众在粮食上的思想情况和粮食底码；四、投机倒把粮商粮贩黑市活动彻底堵塞；五、粮食干部参加了中心工作，学会农村工作方法，专与红统一起来；六、与供销社、信用社互相支援，消除了过去一些扯皮现象。（史庆祥）
