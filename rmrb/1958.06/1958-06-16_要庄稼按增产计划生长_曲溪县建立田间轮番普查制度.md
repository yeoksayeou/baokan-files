To Ensure Crops Grow According to Production Increase Plans
Quxi County Establishes a System of Rotating Field Surveys

Kunming, June 15th (by our reporter Zhang Tingqian) – Quxi County, Yunnan Province, by continuously conducting field surveys and promoting growth in rotation, is ensuring that its spring crops are growing strictly in accordance with the planned targets for increased production.

The people of Quxi County overcame a drought unprecedented in forty years and planted over 40,000 mu of early rice, sugarcane, and cotton, with growth exceeding any previous year. In May, the entire county launched a mass field survey, where people compared the planned output targets for each plot of land with the actual crop growth. Through debate and research, they determined what measures could be taken to increase production and wrote these measures on small flags which they then planted at the edge of the fields. Over three thousand mu of substandard crops identified throughout the county were all treated within five days according to the measures prescribed on the flags. By the beginning of June, the lagging crops had generally turned green and were thriving, some even catching up with the first-class fields. Subsequently, the county party committee mobilized the masses to redouble their efforts and launched a second round of rotating surveys and growth promotion work, focusing on eliminating the poorer portion of the second-class fields, to ensure that crop growth more closely aligns with the targets for increased production.

Now, the Quxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China has also established a monthly system of surveying and ensuring four guarantees (guarantee of quality, guarantee of quantity, guarantee of survival, guarantee of robust growth), preparing to control the crops in one campaign after another, ensuring they develop and grow according to the prescribed specifications. After more than a month of effort, the spring crops and economic crops in Quxi County are growing uniformly and vigorously. The early rice is already over three feet tall, with each seedling having more than twenty effective tillers. The cotton is also about to bloom.

“Giving orders to crops, to make them grow according to production increase plans,” has become the slogan of action for the people of Quxi County. Currently, all townships, communes, and production teams in the county have also established regular inspection and daily acceptance systems at each level. This is to improve the quality of field management, so that crops grow increasingly vigorously, guaranteeing a bumper harvest this year.

    要庄稼按增产计划生长
    曲溪县建立田间轮番普查制度
    本报昆明15日电　记者张廷千报道：云南省曲溪县通过不断的田间普查、轮番催苗，大春作物正严格地按照增产指标的要求在生长。
    曲溪县人民战胜了四十年没有过的干旱现象，栽下了四万多亩早稻、甘蔗和棉花，生长情况超过以往任何一年。5月间，全县展开了全民性的田间普查，人们把每丘田的产量指标和作物生长情况加以对照，通过辩论研究了采取什么措施才能增产，并把这些措施写在小旗上插在田边。全县检查出的三千多亩不合格的作物，在五天内就全部照旗子上规定的措施做了一遍，到6月初，落后作物都普遍转青发旺，有的已经赶上了一等田。接着，县委又动员群众鼓足干劲，开展了第二轮番普查催苗工作。以消灭二类田中较差的那一部分为重点，使作物的成长更加符合增产指标的要求。
    现在，中共曲溪县委又制定了每月一次的普查四包（包质、包量、包活、包壮）制度，准备一个战役接着一个战役地控制作物，按规定的规格发育成长。经过一个多月的努力，曲溪县的大春和经济作物长得整齐而茁壮，早稻已经有三尺多高，每窝的有效分蘖多在二十股左右，棉花也快要开花。
    “向作物下命令，要庄稼按增产计划生长”，已经成了曲溪县人民的行动口号。目前，全县各乡社、生产队又层层建立了定期检查、逐日验收制度。以提高田间管理质量，使庄稼越长越旺，保证今年的大丰收。
