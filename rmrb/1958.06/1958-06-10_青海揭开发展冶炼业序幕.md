Qinghai Unveils Prelude to Developing Smelting Industry

(Our report) According to Qinghai Daily news: Qinghai Province has unveiled the prelude to developing the smelting industry. The Provincial Pig Iron Production Conference, which concluded on May 22, determined that this year's smelting output will be 34,400 tons of pig iron, 1,500 tons of crude copper, and 2,500 tons of crude lead.

Qinghai Province's approach to developing iron smelting and metallurgical industry is to focus on small-scale operations, use local materials, make do with what is available, and implement a widespread, blooming approach. Guided by the spirit of learning while doing, exploring while doing, and building factories while producing, the province will vigorously promote indigenous methods of iron smelting and establish medium and small-sized blast furnaces and indigenous furnaces at the fastest speed. This year, the province has decided to build nine blast furnaces and one hundred and twenty-five indigenous furnaces, which will be put into production successively in late July.

This year, the focus of smelting iron, copper, and lead is on Chaidamu, Haixi, Haibei, and Hainan. Other prefectures (cities) and counties should also carry out smelting extensively and universally based on their resource conditions. At present, the Provincial Department of Industry is concentrating its efforts on allocating equipment and materials for building blast furnaces and resolving technical manpower issues. Not long ago, people were sent to other places to learn furnace construction and production technology, and furnace construction and production experiments were conducted in Xining. The Department of Industry is also stepping up preparations for holding smelting training classes to train technical personnel for various prefectures (cities) and counties. At the same time, transportation, geology, labor, and material supply, as well as other departments, are also actively preparing to support the development of iron smelting and metallurgical industry.

    青海揭开发展冶炼业序幕
    本报讯　据青海日报消息：青海省揭开了发展冶炼工业的序幕。在5月22日结束的全省生铁生产会议确定：今年将冶炼生铁三万四千四百吨、粗铜一千五百吨、粗铅二千五百吨。
    青海省发展炼铁和冶金工业是以小型为主，就地取材，因陋就简，遍地开花为方针，在边学边探，边生产边建厂的精神下，大力推广土法炼铁，用最快的速度建立中小型高炉和土炉。今年全省决定建立九个高炉，一百二十五个土炉，7月下旬就可以陆续投入生产。
    今年冶炼铁、铜、铅的重点放在柴达木、海西、海北和海南，其他各州（市）县也要根据资源情况大量地、普遍地进行冶炼。目前，省工业厅正在集中力量调拨修建高炉的设备器材和解决技术力量问题。不久前已派人到外地学习建炉和生产技术，并在西宁作建炉和生产试验。工业厅还在加紧准备举办冶炼训练班，为各州（市）县培训技术人员。与此同时，交通、地质、劳动和物资供应以及其他部门也都在积极准备支援炼铁和冶金工业的发展。
