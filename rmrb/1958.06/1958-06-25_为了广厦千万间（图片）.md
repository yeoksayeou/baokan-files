    For Tens of Millions of Mansions
    The Korean people are engaged in arduous struggle to restore the cities and countryside that were devastated. In recent years, countless buildings have been newly built and repaired, including a large number of houses. In 1957 alone, workers and staff received 1,540,000 square meters of housing, and agricultural cooperatives in various places built housing for 30,000 households. The picture shows the scene of housing construction in a mining village. Korean Central News Agency Manuscript (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜人民为恢复惨遭破坏的城市和农村，展开了艰苦的斗争。几年来新建和修复了无数建筑物，其中包括大批住宅。仅1957年，工人和职员就得到了一百五十四万平方公尺的住宅，各地农业合作社建设了可容三万户的住宅。图为矿工村正在建设住宅的情景。　朝鲜中央通讯社稿（新华社发）
