　　Brief History of Past Congresses of the Bulgarian Communist Party

　　The Seventh National Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which opened on June 2, is the most significant political event in Bulgarian social life today.

　　The Bulgarian Communist Party was founded on the basis of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party ("Tesnyak" faction). On August 2, 1891, the outstanding Bulgarian Marxist Dimitur Blagoev led the establishment of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, later renamed the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party. The fierce struggle between the revolutionary left wing and the opportunist right wing within the party led to a split in 1903 into two factions: one was the "Tesnyak" faction (also known as the "Narrow" Socialists) led by Blagoev, and the other was the petty-bourgeois opportunist "Obshto Delo" faction (also known as the "Broad" Socialists). The "Tesnyak" Socialists under Blagoev's leadership formed a Marxist workers' party.

　　The glorious congresses of the Bulgarian Communist Party are milestones on the road to victory. The first congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party was held in May 1919. Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party, led by Blagoev, decided at this congress to join the Third International, changed the party's name to the Bulgarian Communist Party, and adopted a new program declaration. This was a historically significant step in the development of the Bulgarian Communist Party on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles.

　　From May 31 to June 2, 1920, the Bulgarian Communist Party held its Second Congress. The congress adopted the party program and formulated the party's work strategy in state, township councils, and church schools. Based on this program and strategy, the Bulgarian Communist Party led mass struggles and successfully seized local power in many municipal councils and some township councils. This achievement greatly benefited the party in uniting the broad masses of working people around itself and greatly enhanced the party's prestige and position.

　　In the context of the rising Bulgarian workers' movement, the Bulgarian Communist Party held its Third Congress in May 1921. The characteristic of this congress was that the party accepted the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution, decided to establish a worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class to strive for revolutionary victory, and launched massive organizational and propaganda work, beginning to lead the increasingly high tide of the people's movement. Due to its strict discipline and organization, the party became the most powerful political force in the country.

　　The Fourth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party was held in June 1922. This meeting adopted the united front strategy formulated by Lenin and adopted by the Communist International in the summer of 1921. After the meeting, the Bulgarian Communist Party took a series of practical measures to establish the united action of the national working people to thwart the evil schemes of the reactionary forces united in the so-called "Constitutional Bloc." However, because the party at that time failed to correctly understand the united front as a form of organizing the working people under the party's banner, it failed to unite the democratic forces among the people around itself, which led to the fascist military coup on June 9, 1923.

　　This coup forced the party to go underground and engage in arduous struggles. However, the party heroically led the anti-fascist struggle of the masses of the people, and launched an anti-fascist armed uprising in September 1923, until the victory of liberation on September 9, 1944. The party became the ruling party, leading the Bulgarian people onto the broad road of free life.

　　After liberation, the Bulgarian Communist Party convened its Fifth National Congress in December 1948. This congress was held under the auspices of the leader and mentor of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov. In his political report to the Central Committee, Dimitrov defined the general line for building socialism. The congress adopted the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) and a resolution on carrying out Marxist-Leninist education and launching a struggle on the ideological front. The congress changed the party's previous name, Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist), to the Bulgarian Communist Party, and made important amendments and supplements to the party constitution. The party became the organizer and inspirer of the high tide of the Bulgarian people's enthusiastic participation in socialist construction, and achieved great achievements.

　　On the basis of the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the Bulgarian Communist Party convened its Sixth Congress from February 25 to March 3, 1954. The congress pointed out that the socialist foundations of Bulgaria had been laid, the nature of the social strata had undergone profound changes, and the worker-peasant alliance had become more consolidated. The congress announced that Bulgaria was transitioning to a new and higher stage—building the edifice of socialist society. The congress also adopted the instructions of the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957). According to the new situation and tasks, the congress made a series of amendments and supplements to the party constitution to further strengthen party unity and improve the overall organizational, political, and ideological work.

　　The long-tested Bulgarian Communist Party has demonstrated its infinite loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, made significant contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist movement, and is waging a resolute struggle against all enemies of communism.

　　保共历届代表大会简况
    6月2日开幕的保加利亚共产党第七次全国代表大会，是当前保加利亚社会生活中最重大的政治事件。
    保加利亚共产党是在保加利亚社会民主党（“紧密”派）的基础上建立起来的。1891年8月2日，保加利亚杰出的马克思主义者布拉戈耶夫领导建立了保加利亚社会民主党，后来改名为保加利亚工人社会民主党。党内革命的左翼和机会主义的右翼之间的激烈斗争，使党在1903年分裂为两派：一派是以布拉戈耶夫为首的“紧密”派（又称为“紧密”社会党），另一派是小资产阶级机会主义分子的“共同事业”派（又称“广泛”社会党）。布拉戈耶夫领导下的“紧密”社会党形成为马克思主义的工人政党。
    光荣的保加利亚共产党的历届代表大会，是从胜利走向胜利的里程碑。保共的第一次代表大会是在1919年5月举行的。在伟大十月社会主义革命的影响下，以布拉戈耶夫为首的保加利亚工人社会民主党在这次代表大会上决定参加第三国际，并把党的名称改为保加利亚共产党，通过了新的纲领宣言。这是保共在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上发展的具有历史意义的一步。
    1920年5月31日到6月2日，保共举行了第二次代表大会。大会通过了党纲，并制订了党在州、乡议会和教会学校的工作策略。保共根据这个纲领和策略，领导了群众性的斗争，成功地夺取了许多市议会和一些乡议会的地方政权。这个成就大大有利于党把广大的劳动人民团结在自己的周围，大大提高了党的威望和地位。
    在保加利亚工人运动日益高涨的情况下，保共在1921年5月举行了第三次代表大会。这次代表大会的特点是：党接受了把无产阶级专政作为无产阶级革命的根本问题的原则，决定建立工人阶级领导下的工农联盟，以争取革命胜利，并展开了巨大的组织工作和宣传工作，开始领导日益高涨的人民运动。党由于严密的纪律性和组织性而成为国内最强大的政治力量。
    保共的第四次代表大会是在1922年6月举行的。这次会议通过了列宁草拟的共产国际在1921年夏天通过的关于统一战线的策略。会后，保共采取了一系列的实际措施，以建立全国劳动人民的统一行动，来击破当时联合在所谓“护宪集团”中的反动势力的罪恶诡计。但由于党当时没能把统一战线正确理解为在党的旗帜下组织劳动人民的形式，因而没能把人民中间的民主力量团结在自己的周围，以致1923年6月9日发生了法西斯军事政变。
    这次政变使党不得不转入地下，进行艰苦的斗争。但党英勇地领导了人民群众的反法西斯斗争，于1923年9月发起了反法西斯武装起义，直到1944年9月9日取得了解放胜利。党成了执政党，领导保加利亚人民踏上了自由生活的宽广道路。
    解放后，保共在1948年12月召开了第五次全国代表大会。这次大会是在保加利亚人民的领袖和导师季米特洛夫的主持下召开的。季米特洛夫在中央委员会的政治报告中确定了建设社会主义的总路线。大会通过了第一个五年计划（1949年—1953年）和关于进行马克思列宁主义教育和开展思想战线的斗争的决议。大会把党的以前的名称保加利亚工人党（共产党）改为保加利亚共产党，并对党章作了重要的修改和补充。党成了保加利亚人民热情地投入社会主义建设的高潮的组织者和鼓舞者，并取得了巨大的成就。
    在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上，保共在1954年2月25日至3月3日召开了第六次代表大会。大会指出，保加利亚的社会主义基础已经奠定，社会各阶层的性质起了深刻的变化，工农联盟已变得更加巩固了。大会宣布，保加利亚正在向新的、更高的阶段——建设社会主义社会大厦过渡。代表大会并通过了第二个五年计划（1953年—1957年）的指示。大会根据新的形势和任务，对党章作了一系列的修改和补充，进一步加强党的团结，提高整个组织、政治和思想工作。
    久经考验的保加利亚共产党，显示了它对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚，为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结作出了重大的贡献，对共产主义的一切敌人进行着坚决的斗争。
