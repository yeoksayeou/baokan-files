Reciting Loudly Before the Masses
Jin Yi

When I am most excited and thrilled, I can only sing out my heart's joy and passion with poetry. I originally started my creative life by writing poetry; soon I found myself lacking the talent of a poet, writing very poorly, and gave up poetry; but I have always placed poetry in the most sublime position in literature and art. Only when I have a full heart of passion to pour out do I forget that I am a failed poet, with no talent for writing poetry at all, and I sing heartily regardless.

I repeatedly read Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and I felt that it was the newest and most beautiful picture, a colorful and harmonious symphony, the most exciting and inspiring poem. I couldn't restrain the true feelings surging in my chest, and without taking the time to conceive and choose words, I hurriedly poured out what was in my heart on paper.

When I went to the masses with Shanghai's 500,000-strong army for publicizing the General Line on June 8th, facing the elderly with white beards, mothers holding children, children wearing red scarves, and many citizens... (Workers and students, like us, were mostly in the 500,000-strong army.) I couldn't help but recite loudly.

I started like this:

"The beacon of the General Line shines in all directions,
Six hundred million people feel bright in their hearts;
One day is worth twenty years,
Beautiful pictures emit a red glow!"

I paused, looked up, and saw that every pair of eyes was shining, every face was smiling; it was as if I was saying what was in their hearts for them. I also smiled, my eyes widened, and my voice became even louder.

"Anshan Iron and Steel in the Northeast is being expanded,
Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel are being built and producing at the same time;
Flowers of steel bloom everywhere,
The motherland will build ten thousand more blast furnaces this year."

I have been to Anshan Iron and Steel, and I have also seen the steel plants in Shanghai and Chongqing; I have only seen pictures of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel in magazines and newspapers. But ten thousand blast furnaces were fresh information I got from the morning paper, beyond what I could imagine; I revised my verses in time, and my heart was full of joy. The three girls in the crowd smiled the most beautifully, it turned out they had just come to Shanghai from the Northeast and Chongqing, and they worked in the seamless steel team of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1.

"Stars in the sky shine brightly,
Factories on the ground open everywhere;
Ignorant birds roam the sky,
Mistaking chimneys for forests and landing there.
The sun shines in the sky during the day,
The fields are brightly lit at night;
The motherland is red all over,
Owls dare not show off anymore.
Railways and highways are like spider webs,
Trains and cars are as fast as the wind;
Ships will sail to Beijing,
Everywhere in the vast land is accessible."

With the construction of the Grand Canal and the navigation of the five rivers, ships can sail all the way from the foot of Mount Emei to Beijing! What a happy and extraordinary era we live in! Under the leadership of the Party, we can turn ideals into reality, turn magic into the ordinary; we can really move mountains and seas, pluck stars and seize the moon, and turn the impossible into the possible.

"Five hundred million farmers work together,
Digging rivers and accumulating fertilizer by the thousands.
From now on, we will not rely on the heavens for food,
Man will conquer nature, changing the great nature!
Four, five, eight hundred can't stop us,
Thousands of catties of grain, tens of thousands of catties of vegetables;
Wheat and barley are like green seas,
After the wheat is harvested, cotton appears."

My praise still lags behind reality, more than one place wants wheat to yield more than two thousand catties per mu, and potatoes can yield thirty thousand catties per mu! My thoughts, my common sense have been left far behind by reality. I should pick up my pace and strive to catch up.

"Not more than fifteen years, but shorter,
Steel and major industries will leave Britain behind.
Agriculture must also run ahead of capitalist countries,
Science and technology will catch up with the advanced, in just twelve years."

"More" and "shorter" are only one word apart, but they represent the common Great Leap Forward of 600 million people! Our coal can catch up with Britain next year, and our steel will probably take less than five years to catch up. It is not only that the East wind prevails over the West wind, but the East wind will forever prevail over the West wind! As a Chinese people, it is worth being proud of, and one should be full of confidence and stride forward. I mustered my strength and recited with all my heart:

"Our motherland is so great,
Our people are hardworking and brave,
With the Communist Party, with Chairman Mao,
Leading 600 million people, going all out, moving forward together!
Build our motherland in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way,
Everyone works hard, everyone strives to be first;
Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do; move forward bravely—
Striving for the truth, for today and tomorrow;
Plant the red flag of the General Line all over the motherland!"

The crowd applauded and cheered in unison; I also applauded. We jointly applauded for our motherland, applauded for the Party and Chairman Mao, and applauded and cheered for our common happy future. I saw the old people straighten their backs, the mothers put their children's little hands to their mouths, the red scarves smiled and jumped, and the faces of the citizens were blooming with smiles. I thought: If I were a twenty-year-old young man, I wouldn't just write; I would definitely stand by the blast furnace, open-hearth furnace, and converter, making iron and steel for the motherland.

    在群众面前高声朗诵
    靳以
    当我最激动最兴奋的时候，我只能用诗歌唱出我满心的欢喜和激情。我原是以写诗来开始我的创作生活的；不久我就发现自己缺乏诗人的才华，写得很不好，放弃了诗作；可是我一直把诗放在文艺中最崇高的地位，只有我满腔热情要倾吐的时候，我就忘记了我自己是一个失败的诗人，根本没有写诗的才能，我就不顾一切地尽情欢唱。
    我反复读了刘少奇同志在八届二次党代表大会上的报告，我感觉到那是最新最美丽的画图，多采而合谐的交响乐章，最激动人心鼓舞人心的诗篇。我忍不住胸中澎湃的真情，来不及构思和择句，就匆匆地把心里的话流在纸上。
    当我在6月8日随着上海的五十万宣传总路线大军，到群众中去；对着飘着白胡子的老年人，抱着孩子的妈妈们，戴了红领巾的孩子们和许多市民……（工人和学生们和我们一样，他们大部分也都在五十万人的队伍之中。）我又情不自禁地高声朗诵。
    我是这样开始的：
    “总路线的灯塔照四方，
    六万万人民心里亮堂堂；
    一天抵得上二十年，
    美丽的画图放红光！”
    我顿了顿，抬头一看，每一双眼睛都发着亮，每一张脸都挂着笑；好像我是替他们说出来心里的话。我也笑了，我的眼睛睁得更大了，我的声音也更高了。
    “东北的鞍钢正扩建，
    武钢，包钢边建边生产；
    钢铁的花朵处处开，
    祖国今年又要造起万座高炉来。”
    鞍钢我去过的，上海的钢铁厂和重庆的钢铁厂我也看过；武钢包钢我只从杂志和报纸上看到图片。可是一万座高炉是我从早晨报纸上才得到的新鲜资料，是我想像所达不到的；我及时地修改了我的诗句，我的心是美滋滋的。人群中三个姑娘笑得最美丽，原来她们是从东北和重庆才来到上海的，她们就在上钢一厂无缝小组工作。
    “天上的星斗点点亮，
    地上的工厂处处开；
    无知的飞鸟漫天游，
    错把烟囱当做树林落下来。
    白日里太阳照天空，
    夜晚原野亮明灯；
    祖国大地红通通，
    夜猫子再也不敢逞威风。
    铁路公路像蛛网，
    火车汽车快如风；
    轮船要开到北京城，
    万里江山处处通。”
    修筑了大运河，五河通航，轮船就一直可以从峨眉山下开到了北京！我们活在一个多么幸福，多么不平凡的时代啊！在党的领导之下，我们能化理想为现实，化神奇为平凡；我们真是能翻山倒海，摘星取月，把不可能的事变成可能的了。
    “五万万农民齐心干，
    挖河积肥千千万。
    从此不靠天吃饭，
    人定胜天，改变了大自然！
    四、五、八百挡不住，
    千斤粮呵，万斤菜；
    小麦大麦像绿海，
    割了麦子显出棉花来。”
    我的歌颂还是落后于现实了，不止一个地要麦子亩产二千斤以上，马铃薯一亩就可以收三万斤！我的思想，我的常识都被现实远远地丢在后边了。我该提起脚步，奋力猛追。
    “不是比十五年多，是更短，
    钢铁和主要工业把英国丢后边。
    农业也要跑在资本主义国家前，
    科学技术赶上先进，只要十二年。”
    “多”和“短”虽然只是一字之差，那却表现了六万万人民共同的大跃进！我们的煤炭明年就可以赶上英国了，我们的钢铁，大约连五年也用不到，就可以赶上。不仅是东风压倒西风，东风将永远压倒西风！做为一个中国人民，是值得骄傲的，是应该满怀信心，大步向前的，我更鼓足了劲，充满了全心的感情念出来：
    “我们的祖国多么伟大，
    我们的人民勤劳勇敢，
    有了共产党，有了毛主席，
    领导着六万万人民，鼓足干劲，齐向前！
    多快好省地建设我们的祖国，
    人人努力，个个争先；
    要敢想，敢说，敢做；勇猛直前——
    为真理而奋斗，为了今天和明天；
    把总路线的红旗在祖国都插遍！”
    群众鼓起掌来，齐声欢呼；我也鼓起掌来。我们共同的为我们祖国鼓掌，向党向毛主席鼓掌，为我们共同幸福的未来鼓掌和欢呼。我看见老年人的腰挺直了，母亲们把孩子的小手偎在自己的嘴边，红领巾们一边笑一边跳，市民们的脸上都绽开了笑的花朵。我想：如果我要是一个二十岁的小伙子，我不会只动笔，我一定站在高炉、平炉和转炉旁，为祖国炼铁炼钢。
