The socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has liberated our thinking, greatly enhanced the political awareness and socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff. The spirit of communism is flourishing in people's thoughts and work. The slogan put forward by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or less has further promoted the socialist revolution and the development of productive forces. Under the guidance of the general line and general policy of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the coal industry has seen a great leap forward.

Before the Rectification Campaign, Problems Sought Cadres, Now Cadres Seek Problems

As a result of the Rectification Campaign, many vivid facts have emerged. The ideological work style of cadres has undergone great changes, which has brought the relationship between cadres and the masses closer. This has promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff, generating infinite power. In turn, it has promoted further improvement of the ideological work style of cadres. After the leading cadres of the Fuxin Mining Bureau ate, lived, and labored with the workers as ordinary laborers, a lively and cheerful atmosphere emerged among the workers. In the past, the workers of this mining bureau criticized the cadres by "saying it with their mouths, writing it on paper, and posting it on the walls." But when the cadres walked out of the office, engaged in experimental fields, and implemented follow-the-shift production, realizing the slogan of "participating in production, guiding production, researching problems, and solving problems," they changed the past work style of "listening, watching, pushing, and dragging." Workers reflected: "In the past, problems sought cadres, now cadres seek problems," "The Communist Party's cadres are really studying hard and practicing hard." After the cadres moved to the workers' residential area, the relationship between workers and cadres became closer, and the workers told the cadres what was in their hearts. These facts show that only when leading cadres appear as ordinary laborers, sharing the same fate as the masses, can the masses "not regard you as officials, but as their own people," and a truly communist equal relationship can appear between cadres and the masses. Comrade Chen Haishan, the mine manager of Ping'an Mine, said: "Moving house removes the foreign-style buildings and official airs, and gains the hearts of the broad masses of workers and staff, which cannot be bought with ten thousand taels of gold."

During the Rectification Campaign, the workers and staff have learned to use big鸣 (ming) [speaking out], big 放 (fang) [airing views], big 字报 (zibao) [character posters], and big 辩论 (bianlun) [debates] as powerful weapons to promote democracy and improve work. They bravely put forward sharp criticisms of many wasteful phenomena in enterprise management, regulations and systems that restrict production, and conservative thinking in leadership, promoting the improvement of enterprise management. For example, in the Huainan Mining Bureau, in the work of rectifying labor organization by adopting the method of big 鸣 (ming) [speaking out], big 放 (fang) [airing views], and big 辩论 (bianlun) [debates], some cadres initially had resistance and were outwardly obedient but inwardly unconvinced about the masses' big 字报 (zibao) [character posters]. For example, the equipment maintenance workers of the electromechanical section of the Xinzhuangzi Mine went to ask the section chief: "What should we do if we have no work to do?" The section chief said: "If there is no work to do today, will there be no work to do tomorrow? Once there is a task, where will we find people?" The workers went back and wrote a big 字报 (zibao) [character poster]: "The electromechanical equipment maintenance team, though small, has all the necessary parts, riveting, welding, machining, and electrical, a lot of people but little work, and nothing to do. Work that can be done in one day is deliberately dragged out for two or three days; for the great leap forward in production, rectifying the organization is the key, conservative thinking should be eliminated, and eliminating idleness should take the lead." After debate, conservative thinking was criticized, and a upsurge of rectifying labor organization formed in the entire mining bureau, eliminating the phenomenon of overlapping institutions and personnel waste. As a result, production increased by two million tons, and more than four thousand workers were reduced. The workers who were reduced have been properly arranged after mass discussion. In addition to supporting local coal mines and construction units, surplus personnel were organized to engage in temporary or long-term sideline production, which is a pioneering initiative with principled significance in socialist labor management and labor organization in our country.

In production and construction, workers and staff are launching an upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced with vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. Rationalization proposals and technological innovations are emerging in large numbers. Indicators are constantly breaking through, and labor efficiency is constantly improving. For example, the chain conveyor used in coal mining faces used to be moved manually piece by piece. After the workers of the Jiawang Mining Bureau created a method of moving the whole machine mechanically, the efficiency increased eight times, and the output of the coal mining face increased by one to two times. After the workers of Jiaozuo Wangfeng Mine worked hard and overcame numerous difficulties, all fifty or so fixed machines underground, such as electric winches, water pumps, endless rope winches, pillar winches, and chain conveyors, have been fully automated. The result of realizing the automation of underground machinery has greatly reduced the physical labor of workers and improved production efficiency. In March, the production efficiency of the whole mine was 26% higher than the national plan, and the overall efficiency increased to two tons, 25% higher than in December last year. After the endless rope electric winch in the transportation roadway was automatically operated, the turnover rate of coal trucks increased by 17.7%. At the same time, because these fifty or so machines were remotely operated and automatically controlled, eighty-one people were saved. Now they have proposed the slogan of striving to fully realize the automation of ground machinery before "July 1st."

Local Coal Mines are Thriving

In the overall great leap forward of industry and agriculture, local coal mines have also shown a vigorous and thriving atmosphere. Liling County, Hunan Province, opened ninety-six small coal kilns in one hundred days, solving the problem of coal for farmers' lives and agricultural capital construction. Jiangxi Province's plan for building coal mines this year was first to design a production capacity of 970,000 tons for new mines, and then increased to 1.58 million tons. As of April, 510,000 tons had already started construction, and the province will strive to reach 2.88 million tons throughout the year. This year, the national local coal mines plan to produce 59 million tons of coal and build new mines with an annual output of more than 30 million tons, equivalent to four times the total number of wells built in the first five years. In this way, the coal needs of agriculture, local industry, and farmers are basically met.

Many things we didn't dare to think about in the past, we dare to think about now. Things that we thought were impossible to do in the past, we can do now. Half a year ago, we still thought that "the shortage of coal supply is a long-term phenomenon," but now this situation has basically been changed. 1958 is a turning point in the development of China's coal industry: with the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Central Committee, with the victory of the Rectification Campaign, and with the situation of the great leap forward, this has laid the political, ideological, and material foundation for the coal industry to develop at a high speed. What needs to be done in 1958 is equal to what needed to be done in the past four or five years, just as Marx predicted that the proletarian revolution will lead us into the great era of "one day equaling twenty years."

Look at three years in five years, and look at the first year in three years. At present, the national coal output is rising day by day. In April, the average daily output of coal mines across the country reached more than 500,000 tons, exceeding the average daily output of 410,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 1957 by 22%. According to this average daily output, the national coal output in 1958 will reach 180 million tons, an increase of 50 million tons over 1957, equivalent to four times the average annual increase of 13.4 million tons during the first five-year plan period. Not only can it guarantee the coal consumption of industry and transportation, but also the civil coal will increase by 10 million tons compared with last year. In 1958, the annual production capacity of new mines built across the country will reach more than 70 million tons, exceeding 50 million tons more than in 1957, exceeding the total construction in the first five-year plan period by more than 7 million tons.

On the basis of the leap forward in 1958, the national coal output in 1959 will reach or exceed 240 million tons. In this way, it will catch up with Britain in two years (Britain produced 220 million tons of coal in 1957, and it is estimated that it will not exceed 230 million tons in 1959).

In 1956, there was also an upsurge in production and construction in the coal industry. However, because we did not deeply and thoroughly understand the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we lacked a conscious understanding. In the first half of 1956, we were misled by the false appearance of "more" coal and relaxed our efforts to increase production. In the second half of the year, under the influence of opposing "rash advances," we negatively emphasized "stability and reliability" and mistakenly believed that the high number of accidents at that time was caused by the high production plan, losing confidence in completing the plan. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was dampened, the production plan was not completed, and it was the year with the least increase in production during the first five-year plan period, resulting in a tight situation of coal supply falling short of demand. When the Central Committee criticized the error of opposing "rash advances," clarified the general line of socialist construction, clarified thinking, improved understanding, and improved communist ideological awareness, it generated great material power and a new upsurge in production and construction reappeared.

Facts have proved that the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is the lighthouse illuminating all work. Deviating from the general line will inevitably lead to errors in work. Implementing the general line will create a vigorous and thriving situation.

Small Coal Kilns Have Many Benefits

To develop the coal industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is by no means something that can be done by the strength of a few people, but must rely on the strength of the majority. That is to say, we must resolutely implement the policy indicated by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao: simultaneous development of central industry and local industry, and simultaneous development of large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises. I think this policy is completely correct. It breaks the "mystification" of industrial construction and is an important policy for realizing China's industrialization and agricultural modernization in socialist construction. Because any construction undertaking in socialism, if it leaves the local and the power of the broad masses of the people, and is monopolized by only a few people, will not have good results. The coal industry has the most profound understanding of this principle and fact, and deeply feels that this policy has opened up a broad development path for the coal industry, and has a specific direction and confidence in solving the tight situation of coal supply falling short of demand. The rapid development of local coal industry production and construction in 1958 has fully demonstrated this. This year, the output of raw coal in local coal industry jumped from 36 million tons in 1957 to 59 million tons, an estimated increase of 23 million tons over last year, equivalent to 85% of the increase of 27 million tons in coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry during the same period. The scale of new well construction jumped from 4 million tons in 1957 to 38 million tons, an estimated increase of 34 million tons over last year, equivalent to the amount of increase in coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry during the same period. From this, it can be fully proved that the idea of looking down on the local, looking down on the masses, and "mystifying" industrial development is obviously wrong. However, this wise and correct instruction of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao has not been deeply understood by all people. Therefore, to implement this policy, it is necessary to carry out ideological work and necessary struggles. How should our Ministry of Coal Industry implement this policy?

We believe that we must jump out of the "small circle" of only managing enterprises under the Ministry of Coal Industry, face the whole country, face the masses, the whole party should run industry, and the whole people should run industry. We should follow Chairman Mao's instructions: use three or four-tenths of our strength to manage the large enterprises directly under our management, and use six or seven-tenths of our strength to help local areas run enterprises well. Therefore, we must rely on the local and fully play the power of the masses. As long as the local and the masses can do it, we will vigorously help them to do it. There are many benefits to doing so, mainly because enterprises are directly managed by party committees and people's committees at all levels, which will inevitably strengthen the leadership of enterprises, bring them closer to the masses, and develop the coal industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Simultaneous development of large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises is from the national scope. In the whole country, large-scale enterprises are the backbone, and medium and small-scale enterprises are the main force; in the local, medium-sized enterprises are the backbone, and small-sized enterprises are the main force; counties and townships should build more small-scale coal mines, especially more small-scale coal kilns. Because small coal kilns have many benefits: they can meet the needs of local economic development, produce and sell locally, require less investment, produce coal quickly, and easily solve the difficulties of geology not keeping up, and the shortage of technical cadres and equipment. Building more small coal kilns can also activate the rural economy and promote the development of agriculture. For example, Nanguzhuang Township in Baofeng County, Henan Province, was originally a poor and backward township. Since the opening of small coal kilns, every household no longer burns firewood. Not only has the source of fertilizer increased, but also the feed for cattle has increased. Therefore, the masses said: "Our cattle no longer 'cry'." In addition, with the profits obtained, they bought 80 waterwheels, 100,000 jin of fertilizer powder, 150,000 jin of cement, 50 kerosene lamps, 2,000 hurricane lamps, and agricultural tools such as plows and rakes, and prepared to buy 22 gas engines and a 40-door telephone exchange to achieve village-by-village telephone service and community-by-community broadcasting.

Is it possible to develop the coal industry in a scattered and widespread manner? We believe that it is possible from all aspects. China's coal resources are extremely abundant and widely distributed. According to existing data, the national coal reserves are estimated to be about 1.2 trillion tons. Among the more than 2,000 counties across the country, more than 1,300 counties have coal resources. Farmers in many areas have rich mining experience. Due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the demand for coal is increasing day by day, so the masses and local areas have a strong demand for opening coal mines. This fully shows that the universal and large-scale development of the coal industry is not only necessary but also possible.

Change the Backward Situation of Coalfield Geology

The development of the coal industry must be closely coordinated with the development of other industries. Therefore, provinces (regions) and cities need to further strengthen leadership and comprehensively plan. According to the possibilities of resources, funds, and sales, build a part of medium-sized coal mines as the backbone to ensure the development of local industry and support the needs of central enterprises. And on the basis of a large number of small coal mines, according to needs, carry out reconstruction and expansion in qualified mining areas to gradually develop them into coal supply bases. At present, coalfield geological exploration work is still very backward. The proven coal reserves cannot yet meet the needs of the development of the coal industry in terms of region and variety, which directly affects the speed of coal industry production and construction. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry of Coal Industry continuing to strengthen geological exploration work, we hope that all localities will actively establish coalfield geological exploration teams to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward.

According to the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions on reforming the system, we plan to retain some major enterprises and bases, and transfer most of the rest to local management. In the future, the Ministry of Coal Industry should actively help the development of local coal mines in terms of providing technical data, guiding technical design, training technical personnel, exchanging advanced experiences, and conducting comprehensive planning.

Our past ideological methods and leadership style of seeing things but not people are a concentrated manifestation of distrusting the masses and a manifestation of our ideological rigidity. In the past, we did not rely enough on the masses to manage production, but rather focused on relying on rules and regulations. Because there are some unrealistic provisions in the rules and regulations, to a certain extent, it also directly or indirectly restricts the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. The occurrence of this situation, in addition to our ideological dogmatism and empiricism, is also due to our high position, entangled in offices and conference rooms all day long, seriously deviating from reality and the masses. In this way, of course, we cannot see new things, and we cannot see the power and creativity of the masses.

To rely on the local and rely on the masses to develop the coal industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must implement the decentralization of power, and revise and abolish those rules and regulations that are not reasonable or wrong enough. Resolutely carry out the Rectification Campaign to the end, and change our leadership style and work methods. In particular, we must do a good job in experimental fields, hold good on-site meetings, and truly go down for four months every year. When we go down, it should not be formalism—from the office of the ministry to the office of the enterprise; but should be directly integrated with the workers and masses, and should sincerely approach the workers and masses, listen to their opinions, and earnestly learn from them. In this way, we can truly understand the actual situation of the enterprise, and can truly guide production, guide the enterprise, and can achieve the great leap forward in production and construction by combining leadership and the masses.

　　煤炭工业明年赶上英国
　　煤炭工业部部长　张霖之
    经过政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，使我们的思想获得了解放，广大职工群众的政治觉悟和社会主义的积极性大大提高。共产主义的精神，正在人们的思想和工作中发扬旺盛。中央和毛主席提出：在十五年或者更短的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国的口号，更加促进了社会主义革命和生产力的发展。在中央提出的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线的照耀下，煤炭工业已经出现了一个大跃进的局面。
    整风前是问题找干部  现在是干部找问题
    由于整风的结果，出现了许多生动的事实。干部的思想作风有了很大的改变，这就密切了干部和群众的关系。从而发扬了职工群众的积极性创造性，产生了无穷的力量。反过来又推动了干部思想作风更进一步的改善。阜新矿务局的领导干部，以普通劳动者的姿态同工人同吃、同住、同劳动以后，在职工中出现了一个生动活泼、心情舒畅的局面。过去这个矿务局的工人，对干部的批评是“说在嘴上，写在纸上，贴在墙上”，而当干部走出办公室，搞试验田，实行跟班生产，实现了“边参加生产、边指导生产、边研究问题、边解决问题”的口号以后，转变了过去那种“听、看、推、拖”的工作作风。工人反映说：“过去是问题找干部，现在是干部找问题”，“共产党的干部真是苦学苦练”。在干部搬到工人住宅区以后，更加密切了工人和干部的关系，工人内心的话也都同干部讲了。这些事实说明：领导干部只有以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众同呼吸，共命运，才能使群众“不把你当作官看，而当成自家的人”，在干部和群众的关系上才真正出现了一个共产主义的平等关系。平安矿长陈海山同志说：“搬家去掉的是洋房、官气，得来的是万两黄金买不到的广大职工的心”。
    在整风过程中，职工群众已学会运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，作为发扬民主改进工作的有力武器，对企业管理中的许多浪费现象、束缚生产的规章制度和领导上的保守思想，勇敢地提出尖锐的批评，推动了企业管理的改进。像淮南矿务局，在采取大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法整顿劳动组织的工作中，开始在有些干部当中还有抵触思想，对群众的大字报是口服心不服。如新庄孜矿机电科的设备检修工人跑去问科长：“我们没有活干怎么办？”，这个科长说：“今天没有活干，明天还没有活干吗？一旦有了任务，上那里要人呢？”工人回去就写了一张大字报：“机电设备检修组，麻雀虽小五脏全，铆、焊、机、电一大堆，人多活少没事干，明明一天干的活，偏要拖它两三天；为了生产大跃进，整顿组织是关键，保守思想应铲除，消灭窝工应领先”。经过辩论，批判了保守思想，在全矿务局就形成了整顿劳动组织的热潮，消除了机构重叠和人员浪费的现象。结果增产二百万吨，还减少了四千多工人。减下来的工人，经过群众讨论都有了妥善的安排。除了支援地方煤矿和建设单位以外，并组织多余人员进行临时性的或长期性的副业生产，这是在我国社会主义的劳动管理和劳动组织中一项具有原则意义的创举。
    在生产建设中，职工群众正以蓬勃旺盛的革命干劲，展开了一个学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮。合理化建议和技术革新大量涌现。指标不断突破，劳动效率不断提高。像采煤工作面用的链板运输机，过去是拆开一节一节的用手工搬移。贾汪矿务局经过职工的创造，采用机械整体移动的方法以后，效率提高了八倍。使采煤工作面的产量提高了一倍到二倍。焦作王封矿经过职工的深钻苦干，战胜了重重困难，井下电绞车、水泵、无极绳绞车、回柱绞车、链板运输机等五十多部固定机械，都已全部实现自动化。实现井下机械自动化的结果，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动，提高了生产效率。3月份全矿生产工效率比国家计划提高了26％，全员效率提高到两吨。比去年12月份提高25％。运输大巷无极绳电绞车实行自动操纵后，煤车周转率提高了17.7％。同时，由于这五十多部机械实行远方操纵、自动控制，还节省了八十一个人。现在他们又提出争取在“七一”以前，全面实现地面机械自动化的口号。
    地方煤矿万马奔腾
    在工农业全面大跃进中，地方煤矿同样地出现了一个干劲十足万马奔腾的气象。湖南醴陵县一百天就开了九十六座小煤窑，解决了农民生活和农业基本建设用煤。江西省今年建设煤矿的计划，第一次订的是新建矿井的设计生产能力为九十七万吨，第二次就增加到一百五十八万吨，截至4月份已经动工的有五十一万吨，全年将争取达到二百八十八万吨。今年全国地方煤矿计划生产煤炭五千九百万吨，建设年产三千多万吨的新矿井，相当第一个五年建井总数的四倍。这样，基本上满足了农业、地方工业和农民的用煤。
    我们过去许多不敢想的事情，现在敢想了。过去认为作不到的事情，现在做到了。在半年以前，我们还认为：“煤炭供应紧张的情况是长期存在的”，现在这种情况已经基本上得到改变。1958年是我国煤炭工业发展的转折点：有了中央提出的社会主义建设的总路线，有了整风的胜利，有了大跃进的形势，这就奠定了煤炭工业能够高速度发展的政治、思想和物质的基础。1958年要做的事情，就等于过去四年或五年要做的事情，正如马克思预言过的，无产阶级革命将使我们进入“会有一天等于二十年”的伟大时期。
    五年看三年，三年看头年。目前全国煤炭产量日日上升，4月份全国煤矿的平均日产量已达到五十万吨以上，超过1957年第四季度平均日产量四十一万吨的22％。按照这个平均日产量计算，1958年全国煤炭产量将达到一亿八千万吨，比1957年增加五千万吨，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增加一千三百四十万吨的四倍。不仅可以保证了工业和交通运输业的用煤，并且民用煤也比去年增加了一千万吨。1958年全国建设新矿井的年生产能力将达七千多万吨，比1957年超过五千多万吨，比第一个五年计划期内的建设总数还超过七百多万吨。
    在1958年跃进的基础上，1959年全国煤炭产量将达到或超过二点四亿吨。这样两年就赶上了英国（1957年英国产煤二点二亿吨，估计1959年超不过二点三亿吨）。
    1956年在煤炭工业中也曾经出现过生产建设的高潮。但是，由于我们对中央和毛主席提出的多快好省的方针，领会的不深不透，缺乏自觉的认识。在1956年前半年，我们被煤炭“多”了的假像所迷惑，放松了对增加产量的努力。下半年在反“冒进”的影响下，又消极地强调了“稳妥可靠”，错误地认为当时事故多是产量计划偏高造成的，对完成计划丧失了信心。结果挫伤了群众情绪，产量计划没有完成，而且是第一个五年计划期内增加生产最少的一年，出现了煤炭供不应求的紧张局面。当中央批判了反“冒进”的错误，明确了社会主义建设的总路线，澄清了思想，提高了认识，提高了共产主义思想觉悟，就产生了伟大的物质力量，重新出现了一个新的生产建设高潮。
    事实证明：鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线是照耀一切工作的灯塔。离开了总路线，就必然会在工作上产生错误。实行了总路线，就出现了一个轰轰烈烈、蓬蓬勃勃的局面。
    小煤窑的好处多得很
    多快好省地发展煤炭工业，绝不是依靠少数人的力量所能办到的，必须是依靠多数人的力量。也就是说，必须坚决执行中央和毛主席所指示的：中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针。我认为这个方针是完全正确的。它破除了工业建设的“神秘化”，是实现我国工业化和农业现代化的社会主义建设的重要方针。因为社会主义的任何建设事业，离开了地方和广大人民的力量，只由少数人包办，都不会有好的结果。这个道理和事实从煤炭工业部来说，体会最为深刻，深深感到这一方针给煤炭工业开辟了广阔的发展道路，对解决煤炭供不应求的紧张局面有了具体方向和信心。从1958年地方煤炭工业生产建设的迅速发展情况来看，就得到了充分的证明。今年地方煤炭工业的原煤产量，由1957年的三千六百万吨，一跃而为五千九百万吨，预计比去年增加二千三百万吨，相当于煤炭工业部所属煤矿在同期增长二千七百万吨的85％。新井建设规模由1957年的四百万吨，一跃而为三千八百万吨，预计比去年增长三千四百万吨，相当于煤炭工业部所属煤矿在同期增长的数量。从此可以充分证明那种看不起地方，看不起群众，把办工业“神秘化”起来的思想，显然是错误的。但是，中央和毛主席这个英明正确的指示，还没有被所有的人深刻理解。因此，贯彻执行这个方针，还需要进行思想工作和必要的斗争。我们煤炭工业部怎样来贯彻执行这个方针呢？
    我们认为必须跳出只管煤炭工业部所属企业的“小圈子”，面向全国，面向群众，全党办工业，全民办工业。应该遵照毛主席的指示：以三、四分的力量经营直接管理的大企业，以六、七分的力量帮助地方办好企业。因此，必须依靠地方和充分发挥群众的力量，只要地方和群众能办的，我们就大力帮助他们去办。这样作好处很多，主要是企业由各级党委和人民委员会直接管理，这就必然加强了对企业的领导，密切了和群众的关系，就会多快好省地发展煤炭工业。
    大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，是从全国范围来说的。在全国是以大型为骨干，以中小型为主；在地方是以中型为骨干，以小型为主；在县、乡应多办小型煤矿，特别要多开小煤窑。因为小煤窑的好处很多：它可以适应当地经济发展的需要，地产地销，投资少，出煤快，并易于解决地质赶不上和技术干部以及设备不足的困难。多办小煤窑还可以活跃农村经济，促进农业的发展。如河南宝丰县南雇庄乡，原是一个贫苦落后乡，自从开办小煤窑以后，家家不再烧柴草了。不仅增加了肥料的来源，而且也增加了牛的饲料。所以群众说：“我们的牛不再‘叫’了”。此外用获得的利润，买了水车八十部、肥田粉十万斤、洋灰十五万斤、汽灯五十盏、马灯二千盏和犁、耙等农具，并准备买二十二部煤气机和一部四十门的电话总机，作到村村有电话，社社有广播。
    星罗棋布、遍地开花地发展煤炭工业，是否有可能呢？我们认为从各方面来看，都是可能的。我国煤炭资源极为丰富，而且分布很广。根据现有资料估计，全国煤炭储量约有一万二千亿吨。全国二千多个县中，有一千三百多个县有煤炭资源。许多地区的农民有着丰富的开矿经验。由于工农业的迅速发展，对煤炭的需要量日益增长，因而群众和地方对开办煤矿有着强烈的要求。这充分说明，普遍地、大量地发展煤炭工业，不仅是需要，而且是可能的。
    改变煤田地质的落后状况
    煤炭工业的发展，必须与其他工业的发展取得密切的配合。因此需要各省（区）、市进一步的加强领导，全面规划。根据资源、资金、销路的可能，建设一部分中型煤矿作为骨干，以保证地方工业的发展，支援中央企业的需要。并且在大量发展小型煤矿的基础上，根据需要，在有条件的矿区，进行改建和扩建，使它逐步发展成为煤炭供应的基地。当前煤田地质勘探工作还是很落后的，现已探明的煤炭储量，在地区上和品种上，还不能适应煤炭工业发展的需要，这就直接影响着煤炭工业生产建设的速度。因此，除煤炭工业部继续加强地质勘探工作外，希望各地积极地建立煤田地质勘探队伍，以适应大跃进的新局面。
    根据中央改革体制的指示精神，我们拟留部分主要的企业和基地，其余大部分下放给地方管理。煤炭部今后应积极的在供给技术资料、指导技术设计、培养技术人员、交流先进经验、进行全面规划等方面帮助地方煤矿的发展。
    我们过去那种见物不见人的思想方法和领导作风，是不相信群众的集中表现，也是我们思想僵化的表现。过去我们依靠群众管理生产是不够的，而是偏重了依靠规章制度。由于规章制度中存在着若干不切合实际的规定，因此，在某种程度上也直接或间接的限制了群众的积极性和创造性。这种情况的发生，除了我们思想上的教条主义和经验主义外，还由于我们高高在上，一天纠缠在办公室和会议室里，严重地脱离了实际、脱离了群众。这样当然也就不能看到新鲜事物，不能看到群众的力量和创造。
    我们要依靠地方、依靠群众，多快好省地发展煤炭工业，必须实行权限下放，修改与废除那些不够合理的或错误的规章制度。坚决把整风运动进行到底，改变我们的领导作风和工作方法。特别是要搞好试验田，开好现场会议和真正做到每年下去四个月。我们下去的时候，不应该是形式主义的——从部的办公室走到企业的办公室；而是应该直接和工人群众打成一片，应该诚心诚意的接近工人群众，倾听他们的意见，认真向他们学习。这样，我们才能真正了解企业的实际情况，也才能真正指导生产、指导企业，才能做到领导与群众相结合地实现生产建设大跃进。
