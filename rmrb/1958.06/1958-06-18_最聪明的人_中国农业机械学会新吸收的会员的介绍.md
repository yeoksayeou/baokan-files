    The Most Intelligent People
    -- Introductions to Newly Admitted Members of the Chinese Agricultural Machinery Society
    Peng Zongshun Creates Eight New Types of Farm Implements
    Peng Zongshun, a member of the Haiguang Agricultural Cooperative in Dengjia Township, Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, is a member of the Communist Youth League and is twenty-three years old this year. This young man had never attended school nor learned the craft of making farm tools, but in the past two years, he has invented eight new types of farm implements, including a wheat harvester, a wheat seeder, a tea rolling machine, and a corn sheller, increasing labor efficiency by one to forty times. According to preliminary estimates, if only four new farm implements, such as the wheat harvester, tea rolling machine, and corn sheller, are promoted in Beichuan County, the county can save 400,000 labor days each year.
    Peng Zongshun began to research and trial-produce new farm tools in the spring of 1956. At that time, it was the wheat harvest, and labor was very tight. The local Party organization called on everyone to find ways to solve this difficulty. When Peng Zongshun was trial-producing the wheat harvester, he failed ten times in a row due to a lack of knowledge and experience. However, with the encouragement and support of the Party, he was not discouraged. After nearly a year of research and improvement, he finally succeeded in creating it, increasing work efficiency by more than four times. Because of his persevering spirit of innovation, Peng Zongshun has been rewarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. Recently, under the call of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, rural youths in Sichuan Province have also launched a movement to learn from Peng Zongshun's spirit of innovation.
    Gui Yongcai Creates Internal Hole Grinding Machine
    The inventor who improved the production efficiency of automobile part injector nozzles by twenty-four times is Gui Yongcai, an old worker at the state-owned Southwest Instrument Factory.
    In the past, the factory produced injector nozzles in the same way as other factories in China, generally by manual operation, with very low efficiency. Inspired by the slogan of catching up with Britain in fifteen years, Gui Yongcai was determined to change the slow production of injector nozzles. He ran to libraries to read books on automatic machinery, and also went to spinning mills and wire factories to visit automatic machines. With the help of other veteran workers and engineers, he used several nights to successfully trial-produce an internal hole grinding machine. The production process of injector nozzles has since been mechanized, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times and ending the heavy manual labor of the past. In the past, manual production of injector nozzles required skilled fitters of level seven or eight to operate, but now ordinary workers can also operate it.
    Gui Yongcai has only attended elementary school. In the years since liberation, due to his diligent study and hard work, he can now not only understand general books on technical theory, but also learn square roots and algebra. Zhang Hongtang Creates Large Hand-operated Waterwheel
    Zhang Hongtang, thirty-four years old this year, is a blacksmith at the Changgua Iron Works in Ningjin County, Hebei Province. In February 1958, he successfully created a large double-wheel, double-pipe hand-operated waterwheel.
    In the winter of 1957, Ningjin realized water conservancy, and agricultural cooperatives generally felt the lack of water lifting tools, and some cooperatives lacked funds. In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, Zhang Hongtang decided to use the waste materials that the masses had and the wood that was easy to buy in rural areas to manufacture a waterwheel. After contacting the agricultural cooperative, he found discarded cart wheels and wooden pipe chains. When studying the manufacture of waterwheels, although he was ridiculed by the members, he was not discouraged. The initially manufactured small wooden wheels with belts were too small, and the belts could not drive them, so water could not be produced. Later, they were enlarged before it was successful.
    This waterwheel is made of two large cart wheels, plus a wooden frame, and two sets of waterwheel pipe chains. The characteristics of this waterwheel are: using waste materials, simple structure, easy operation, large water output, and more land can be irrigated.
    Zhou Shengxin Creates Arched Elevated Wooden Flume
    Zhou Shengxin is from Xiazhai Village, Xiazhai Township, Pinghe County, Fujian Province. He is of peasant origin, with an elementary school education. He is currently the Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau of Pinghe County, Fujian Province.
    1.  Modification and comprehensive utilization of water turbine pumps. The water turbine pump is a new type of water lifting tool that uses water power to drive the turbine as power. It does not require fuel or technicians to manage it, and it can lift water for irrigation. Before the modification, it was used for water lifting alone. Because there is more rainfall in the south, building a water turbine pump is only used for a few months each year. In 1956, Zhou Shengxin attended the representative meeting of advanced workers in the provincial water conservancy system. After returning to the county, he changed the water turbine pump to comprehensive utilization, combining power generation, wheat milling, and rice milling. The modification method is to extend the central axis of the water turbine pump by thirty centimeters out of the main engine pit surface, and then make a pulley, add a bearing and bearing frame, etc. The cost of each modification is eighty to one hundred yuan. It was officially put into production on June 1, 1957.
    2.  Creation of arched elevated wooden flume. The first construction of this project was in Xifeng, Jiufeng District, Pinghe County, called the Xifeng Flume. It is forty meters long in total, 16.9 meters high, and the arch spans 20 meters. Because the terrain is high and steep, the river channel is steep and the flow rate is high. If a mountain flood breaks out, the water level will rise to 7.4 meters high. If general methods are used, it is easy to be washed away. At that time, it was also impossible to do because the funding could not be afforded. When it was repaired in the spring of 1957, Zhou Shengxin designed an arched drawing. This type of drawing has the following advantages after summarizing: ① It can avoid being washed away during mountain floods and increase the life of the project. ② Save materials and reduce project costs. ③ Increase load-bearing capacity, stabilize piles and columns, and will not shake. ④ Wood and stone workers can work at the same time, which can shorten the construction time.
    Chen Guosheng Creates Bund Builder
    Chen Guosheng, a member of the Chengguan Wooden Farm Implement Handicraft Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, is of worker origin, twenty-three years old this year, a member of the Communist Youth League, and has an equivalent education to higher elementary school.
    This young worker, in the great leap forward of agricultural production, according to the characteristics of Yangcheng County, which is mostly mountainous and has a serious problem of soil erosion over the years, after arduous research, finally created a bund builder in March of this year. Mountain farmers can use this tool to level the land and build field bunds to achieve the effects of soil conservation, water conservation, and fertilizer conservation. This tool is cheap, only eight or nine yuan per unit, but the efficiency is very high. It only requires one person to hold it and one animal to pull it. It can level the land and build field bunds for sixty to eighty mu a day, which is about twenty-five times more efficient than manual labor. This tool is warmly welcomed by the local people, and more than one hundred units have now been promoted throughout the county.
    Wang Jianmin Creates Hand-cranked Stone Mill
    Wang Jianmin, a member of the Chengguan Iron Works in Suning County, Hebei Province, is twenty-five years old and has an elementary school education. He and another fitter, Xu Huaichen, jointly researched and transformed the stone mill. After more than twenty days of research, they finally created a hand-cranked stone mill. This stone mill can grind eighty catties of coarse grain and fifty catties of wheat per hour, which is much more efficient than ordinary stone mills.

    最聪明的人
    ——中国农业机械学会新吸收的会员的介绍
    彭宗顺创造八种新农具
    共青团员彭宗顺，四川省北川县邓家乡海光农业社社员，今年二十三岁。这个青年过去从来没有进过学校，也没有学过制造农具的手艺，但是，他在近两年中创造发明了割麦机、小麦播种机、揉茶机、玉米脱粒机等八种新农具，使劳动效率提高一倍到四十多倍。据初步估计，仅割麦机、揉茶机、玉米脱粒机等四种新农具，如果在北川县推广，全县每年就能节省四十万个劳动日。
    彭宗顺是1956年春开始研究试制新农具的，当时正收割小麦，劳力非常紧张，当地党组织就号召大家想法解决这一困难。彭宗顺在试制割麦机时，因为缺乏知识和经验，曾连续失败十次，但是在党的鼓励和支持下，他毫不灰心，经过近一年时间的研究改进，终于创造成功，提高工效四倍以上。因为他坚韧不拔的革新精神，彭宗顺曾得到共青团中央和共青团四川省委的奖励。最近，在共青团四川省委的号召下，四川省的农村青年还开展了学习彭宗顺革新精神的运动。
    桂永才创造内孔研磨机
    把汽车零件喷油嘴的制作工效提高了二十四倍的发明者，是国营西南仪器厂老工人桂永才。
    过去该厂制作喷油嘴和国内别的工厂一样，一般都是手工操作，工效很低。桂永才在十五年赶上英国的口号鼓舞下，决心要改变制作喷油嘴速度缓慢的现象，他跑遍图书馆翻阅自动机械的书籍，又到纺纱厂、电线厂去参观自动机，在其他老工人和工程师的帮助下，他利用几个夜间的时间，终于试制成内孔研磨机，喷油嘴的制作过程从此机械化，提高了工效二十多倍，结束了以往笨重的手工劳动。过去手工制作喷油嘴，需七、八级的熟练钳工操作，现在一般工人也能操作。
    桂永才，只读过小学，解放几年来，由于他的勤学苦练，现在不仅能看懂一般有关技术理论的书籍，还学会了开方代数。张洪堂创造大型手摇水车
    张洪堂，今年三十四岁，河北省宁津县长官铁业社锻工，于1958年2月创造成功大型双轮双管手摇水车。
    1957年冬宁津实现了水利化，各农业社普遍感到缺乏提水工具，有的社资金不足。张洪堂为了支持农业生产大跃进，决定用群众现有的废料和农村容易买到的木材，制造出水车来。他和农业社接洽以后，找到了废大车轮和木头管链等。在研究制造水车时，虽然受到社员们的嘲笑、讥讽，但他没有灰心，起初制造的皮带小木轮过小，皮带带不动，不能出水，后来又加大，才成功了。
    这辆水车是用两个大车轮，加一木架，用两套水车管链做成的。这辆水车的特点是：利用废物，构造简单，操作轻便，出水量大，浇地多。
    周盛新创造拱形高架木渡槽
    周盛新是福建省平和县下寨乡下寨村人，农民出身，小学文化程度，现在是福建省平和县水利局副局长。
    一、改装水轮泵综合利用。水轮泵是一种新型的提水工具，利用水力来带动水轮机做为动力，既不要用燃料又不要技术工人来管理，就能提水灌溉。在没有改装前是单独提水，因南方雨量比较多，建一个水轮泵每年只用几个月。1956年周盛新出席省水利系统先进工作者代表会，回县后就把水轮泵改为综合利用，结合发电、磨麦、碾米等。改装办法是在水轮泵中心轴延长出主机坑面三十公分，然后做一个皮带轮加挂一个轴承与轴承架等，每台改装费八十到一百元。1957年6月1日就正式投入生产。
    二、创造拱形高架木渡槽。该工程第一次修建在平和县九峰区溪峰，名叫溪峰渡槽，总长四十公尺，高十六点九公尺，拱形跨度二十公尺，因地形山势高耸，河道陡急，流速大，如遇山洪暴发水位高涨达到七点四公尺高，若用一般做法极易冲毁，当时也没有可能做，因经费负担不了，至1957年春修时，周盛新设计出拱形做法图样。这种图样经过总结有以下几点好处：①可以避免山洪暴发时冲坏，增长工程寿命。②节约材料、降低工程造价。③增加载重能力，桩柱稳定，不会动摇。④木石工同时进行工作，可缩短修建时间。
    陈国盛创造筑埂器
    陈国盛，山西阳城县城关木制农具手工业合作社社员，工人出身，今年二十三岁，共青团员，相当于高小程度。
    这位青年工人，在农业生产大跃进中，根据阳城县多山，历年来水土流失较严重的特点，经过刻苦钻研，终于在今年3月间创造出一种筑埂器。山区农民可以用这种工具来平整土地，建筑地埂，以达到保土、保水、保肥的作用。这种工具价钱便宜，每部只八、九元，效率却很高，只需要一个人扶，一个畜力拉，一天就可平整土地和建筑地埂六十亩到八十亩，比人工提高效率二十五倍左右。这种工具受到当地群众的热烈欢迎，现在全县已推广了一百多部。
    王建民创造手摇石磨
    王建民，河北省肃宁县城关铁业社社员，二十五岁，小学文化程度。他和另一个钳工许怀臣共同研究改造石磨，经过二十多天钻研，终于造成手摇石磨。这种石磨一小时可以磨出八十斤粗粮，五十斤小麦，比一般石磨的效率大大提高。
