Noble Communist Virtue
    PLA Driver Sun Taiyun Fears No Danger and Sacrifices Himself for Others
    Thirteen陵 Reservoir Engineering Headquarters Awards Special Prize

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Thirteen陵 Reservoir Engineering Headquarters recently awarded a special prize to Sun Taiyun, a Communist Party member and driver of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who participated in voluntary labor on the construction site, for his noble Communist virtue of fearing no danger and sacrificing himself for others.
    On the 5th of this month, Sun Taiyun was driving a ten-wheeled truck, towing a trailer loaded with three tons of earth. Unexpectedly, while going downhill, the car's parts suddenly malfunctioned, the right rear wheel threw off the axle lock nut, and the brakes failed. The truck was about to rush into the crowd of people busy carrying earth. At this time, there were two paths in front of Sun Taiyun: one was to let the truck rush down the avenue, which could save himself but cause many casualties; the other was to drive the car towards the small mountain on the side of the road, disregarding his own life, but preventing casualties among the earth-carrying crowd. In this critical moment, Sun Taiyun unhesitatingly turned the steering wheel and let the truck rush towards the hillside. The car rushed up the hillside, and Sun Taiyun fainted in the car. The back of his left hand and his metacarpal bone were injured.
    The injured Sun Taiyun received emergency treatment in the hospital and fortunately his life is not in danger.

    高尚的共产主义品德
    解放军司机孙太云临难不惧舍己为人
    十三陵水库工程总指挥部授予特等奖
    本报讯　十三陵水库工程总指挥部最近授予在工地上参加义务劳动的解放军某部司机共产党员孙太云特等奖；奖励他临难不惧，舍己为人的高尚的共产主义品德。
    孙太云在本月5日驾驶十轮大卡车，拖着载有三吨土方的拖斗驶行。不料在下坡时，汽车机件突然失灵，右后轮甩出轴承锁母，刹车无效，眼看卡车就要冲向正在穿梭般地忙着挑土的人群。这时，摆在孙太云面前的有两条路：一条是让卡车顺着大道冲下去，这样可以保存自己，而却造成很多人伤亡的事故；另一条是把车开向路旁的小山，不顾自己的生命危险，但却能免除挑土人群的伤亡。在这千钧一发的时刻里，孙太云毫不犹豫地把方向盘一横，让卡车向路旁的山坡冲去。汽车冲上山坡，孙太云昏倒在车上，他的左手背和手背骨受了伤。
    受伤的孙太云经过医院急救，幸无生命危险。
