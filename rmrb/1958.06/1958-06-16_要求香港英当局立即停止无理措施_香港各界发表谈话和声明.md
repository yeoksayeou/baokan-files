Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 15th: Various circles in Hong Kong issued statements and declarations on June 12th, supporting the protest lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately cease their unreasonable measures infringing upon the patriotic rights of Chinese residents.

The entire faculty and staff of the ten workers' children schools and workers' night schools affiliated with the Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers' Education Promotion Association issued a joint statement on June 12th, saying that the Hong Kong Director of Education openly interfered with the hanging of the Chinese national flag by workers' children schools and other schools, and that this measure restricting our patriotic rights is extremely unreasonable. The statement said, "We unanimously support the serious protest lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the British Chargé d'Affaires."

More than two thousand workers from the Hong Kong Naval Dockyard held a meeting on the evening of June 12th. When the chairman of the meeting mentioned that the dockyard workers unanimously supported the protest of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the entire audience burst into warm applause. The workers who spoke at the meeting refuted the Hong Kong British authorities' remarks based on facts. Social organizations such as the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Reform Association, the Chinese Clerical Association, and the Qingyuan Association also held meetings separately to condemn the Hong Kong British authorities' measures interfering with the patriotic rights of Hong Kong Chinese residents. Eighteen well-known figures in Hong Kong society, in their talks to newspaper reporters, expressed their opposition to the unreasonable measures of the Hong Kong Director of Education and their support for the note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British Chargé d'Affaires. These figures included Gao Zhuoxiong, President of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Zheng Tieru, Manager of the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China, Zhang Huanwen, General Manager of China Resources Company in Hong Kong, Huang Kuancheng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Import and Export Chamber of Commerce, and journalists Fei Yimin and Li Zisong, among others. After refuting the Hong Kong authorities' untrue remarks, they demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities guarantee that similar incidents infringing upon the patriotic rights of Chinese compatriots will not occur again in the future.
