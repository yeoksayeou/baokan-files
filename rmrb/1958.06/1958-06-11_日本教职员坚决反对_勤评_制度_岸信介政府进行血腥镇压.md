Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th Dispatch: Because the Wakayama Prefecture Education Committee in Japan refused to abolish the reactionary "Performance Evaluation" system and dispatched police to suppress them, clashes occurred between teachers and police in front of the Wakayama Prefecture Education Committee office building on the evening of the 9th, resulting in ninety-seven teachers being injured.

The teachers' protest group subsequently held a temporary assembly in front of the Education Committee office building, passing a declaration of "fighting to the end by all members," and sent representatives to meet with Kaneda, the head of the prefectural police headquarters, to protest the illegal suppression by the police headquarters.

Teachers in Wakayama Prefecture began their strike on June 5th. On the evening of the 8th, approximately 2,500 teachers in Wakayama City surrounded the Wakayama Prefectural Police Headquarters to protest the police headquarters' arrest of a member of the teachers' union who participated in the strike struggle. Clashes also occurred at that time with the police who came out to suppress them. The teachers' union held a mass meeting in Wakayama City on the afternoon of the 9th. The meeting passed a resolution and notified the Education Committee that it would continue to fight against the "Performance Evaluation" system. At the same time, teachers in Kochi Prefecture and Shikoku also held strikes to protest the "Performance Evaluation" system.

In order to suppress the Japanese Teachers Union's opposition to the "Performance Evaluation" system, the Kishi Nobusuke government, on the morning of the 10th, again arrested Nakagawa Chisato, the Shinagawa branch chief of the Tokyo Teachers Union, on suspicion of violating the Local Public Service Law.
