    Wang Amao Saves a Child
    On May 20th, Comrade Wang Amao, a driver from the First Motorcade of the Jiangxi Gannan Highway Transportation Bureau, was driving the Ningdu-Ganzhou bus. As the bus approached Tashan below Sanmen Tan, he saw two children playing by the river. Suddenly, the younger child (about four years old) lost his footing and fell into the water. The current was swift, and in the blink of an eye, the child was swept to the center of the river. In this critical moment, Wang Amao immediately stopped the bus and jumped into the river without hesitation. Because the river was very deep, the child had already sunk to the bottom. Wang Amao also dove into the water to search for him. The passengers in the bus, seeing both of them disappear underwater, got out to try and help. Just then, Wang Amao emerged from the water, dragging the child with one hand and paddling with the other. He quickly swam to the shore. At this time, the villagers who had rushed to help also arrived at the riverbank. Everyone was moved by Wang Amao's heroic act of saving the child. Wang Amao didn't even change his wet clothes and continued driving the bus, arriving in Ganzhou on schedule.

    王阿毛救了孩子
    5月20日，江西赣南公路运输局第一汽车队司机王阿毛同志驾驶宁赣班车，车子开到三门滩塔山下的时候，看见有两个小孩在河边玩水，其中年纪小的一个（四岁左右）忽然失足落水，水流很急，转眼的工夫就把小孩卷到河心去了。正在这千钧一发之际，王阿毛马上把汽车停住，奋不顾身的跳下河去。因河水很深，小孩已沉到水底去了，王阿毛也随着潜入水中寻找。车中的旅客看见两个人都沉入水中，都纷纷下来想法急救。就在这时候，王阿毛从水里钻了出来，一个手拖着小孩，一个手划着水，几下子就游到岸上。这时，村里赶来救人的农民也来到河边，大家都被王阿毛英勇救小孩的行动所感动。王阿毛连湿衣服也没有换，继续开动汽车，正点到达赣州。
