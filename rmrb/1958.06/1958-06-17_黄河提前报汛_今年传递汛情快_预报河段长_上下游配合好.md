Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 16th: The Yellow River began its comprehensive flood reporting work half a month early, on the 15th. A total of 278 meteorological and hydrological stations throughout the basin are involved in this year's flood reporting. Currently, the water situation is stable, and there are no signs of flooding.

This year's Yellow River flood reporting work has been greatly improved. In order to allow downstream flood prevention to be fully prepared before the arrival of the flood peak, and to ensure the safety of the Sanmenxia project, it is now stipulated that the rain situation reports from stations below Longmen will increase from two to four times a day in the past to six times. The Longmen station on the main stream and the Huaxian station on the major tributary Wei River will report once for every 200 cubic meters per second increase in flow, and once per hour when the flood peak passes. In the past, forecasts were only made for flood peaks with a flow rate of more than 2,000 cubic meters per second, but now forecasts are also made for small flood peaks with a flow rate of more than 1,000 cubic meters per second. In the past, flood information was transmitted by telegram, but this year, places such as Heishiguan on the Yi and Luo Rivers have switched to telephone transmission, which will speed up transmission and save a lot of expenses. In the past, upstream and downstream stations were not allowed to have horizontal relationships and were not allowed to exchange information. This year, in order to enable downstream stations to observe with preparation, upstream stations can tell downstream stations about the water situation. The river section for flood forecasting has been extended from 3,470 kilometers last year to 4,770 kilometers. The water diversion and irrigation gates built along the river are also equipped with water gauges to report the rise and fall of the water situation and the situation of water release for irrigation every day.

Recently, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission held the first Yellow River flood reporting work conference in Tongguan. The meeting focused on criticizing the erroneous view of emphasizing measurement over flood reporting, and clearly stipulated that flood reporting work should be done first during the flood season; and that flood forecasts should be revised at any time.

    黄河提前报汛
    今年传递汛情快　预报河段长　上下游配合好
    据新华社郑州16日电　黄河在15日提前半月开始全面报汛工作。全流域今年投入报汛的气象、水文测站共有二百七十八个。这几天，水情平稳，还没有涨发洪水的征候。
    今年黄河报汛工作有很大改进。为了在洪峰到来之前，使下游的防汛得到充分准备和三门峡工程安全进行，今年规定龙门以下的测站，下雨时的雨情报告由过去每天二至四次增加到六次；干流龙门和大支流渭河华县测站，流量每涨二百秒公方就报告一次，洪峰通过时每小时报告一次；过去对于二千秒公方流量以上的洪峰才作预报，现在改为对一千秒公方流量以上的小洪峰也作预报；往年都是用电报传报汛情，今年伊洛河黑石关等处改用电话传报，这样就能传递得快，也节约大笔开支；过去，上下游的测站不得发生横的关系，不得互通情报，今年为了使下游测站能够有准备地观测，上游测站可以把水情告诉下游的测站。汛情预报的河段，由去年的三千四百七十公里伸延到四千七百七十公里；沿河建设的引水灌溉闸门也都设了水尺，每天报告水情的涨落和放水灌溉的情况。
    最近，黄河水利委员会已在潼关召开了黄河第一次报汛工作会议。会上着重批判了重测验轻报汛的错误观点，明确规定在汛期要首先做好报汛工作；并且做到随时修正洪水预报。
