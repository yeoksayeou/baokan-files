Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 4th: The French General Confederation of Labor has refused to negotiate with De Gaulle, who has usurped power.

　　De Gaulle recently invited representatives from the French General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" General Confederation, and the Catholic Labor League for consultations. The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor replied to De Gaulle yesterday, stating that the General Confederation has never refused to discuss and negotiate with legally formed governments, but "the abnormal circumstances surrounding the formation of the government you lead have been condemned by the working people and have caused them deep-seated unease." At the same time, "your refusal in the National Assembly yesterday to explicitly guarantee social rights only deepens the workers' legitimate unease."

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: TASS, Paris, June 4th: The French Catholic Labor League issued a statement on the 3rd stating that it would adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward the De Gaulle government until it had determined its social policies.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 3rd: "Red Right Newspaper" published an article by Hochman on the 2nd, commenting on De Gaulle's rise to power in France. The article wrote that, without a doubt, General De Gaulle represents dictatorship, representing a political system that means the abolition of existing bourgeois democratic institutions…. But the vast majority of French people have on many occasions very firmly expressed their opposition to this so-called De Gaulle's "statesmanship." For this reason, De Gaulle was unable to realize his claims in the first few years after the war.

　　The article said that the four-year Algerian war, which exhausted France, greatly reduced France's prestige and caused a serious internal political crisis; at the same time, it aroused weariness of the endless quarrels of bourgeois parties among the broad strata of the French public, and it aroused chauvinistic and nationalistic sentiments.

　　The article pointed out that the recent developments in France were not carried out according to the plans prepared in advance by the bourgeois parties, and the way De Gaulle came to power was not the way the extreme right originally planned.

　　The article said that the clamor of certain generals in Algeria was not enough to bring De Gaulle to power as people had originally imagined. In order to bring De Gaulle to power, it was also necessary to use the leaders of the Socialist Party. The majority of the people are opposed to the implementation of dictatorship in France, and the reactionaries have had to consider this force from beginning to end, and they will have to consider this force in the near future. In addition to these facts, it is also necessary to point out that De Gaulle deliberately formulated his program vaguely and issued statements about his intention not to be a dictator. In France, various very different social forces are conflicting and influencing each other. The changes in France have not changed the basic facts of the world's balance of power. The well-known situation that is developing in favor of peace, democracy, and socialist forces remains unchanged.

　　The article concluded by saying that, in any case, one must firmly believe in the French people, who have democratic traditions, revolutionary spirit, and a love of freedom, and firmly believe in their largest party, the Communist Party. France has experienced different periods in history, and in the end the people will always win. This is more certain than ever in our era.

### 法总工会拒绝同戴高乐商谈  捷“红色权利报”指出法国人民将取得最后胜利

　　法总工会拒绝同戴高乐商谈
    捷“红色权利报”指出法国人民将取得最后胜利
    新华社巴黎4日电　法国总工会拒绝同篡夺政权的戴高乐进行商谈。
    戴高乐最近邀请法国总工会、“工人力量”总工会和天主教劳工联盟的代表进行商谈。法国总工会行政委员会昨天复信戴高乐说，总工会从来没有拒绝同合法组成的政府进行讨论和商谈，但是“你所领导的政府成立时的不正常情况遭到劳动人民的谴责，并且在他们中间引起了极深切的不安。”同时“你昨天在国民议会里拒绝明白地保证保障社会权利，这只有加深工人们的正当不安。”
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社巴黎4日讯：法国天主教劳工联盟3日发表声明说，在戴高乐政府没有确定它的社会政策以前，它将对戴高乐政府抱着观望的态度。
    新华社布拉格3日电　“红色权利报”2日登载了霍赫曼的一篇文章，评论戴高乐在法国上台。文章写道，毫无疑问，戴高乐将军代表着独裁，代表着一种意味着取消现有资产阶级民主制度的政治制度……。但是绝大多数法国人在许多场合都已经非常坚定地表示反对这种所谓戴高乐的“政治家风度”。因为这个理由，戴高乐在战后的头几年中就没有能够实现他的主张。
    文章说，把法国弄得财穷力竭的四年阿尔及利亚战争使得法国的威信大为降低，并且引起了严重的内部政治危机；同时它在法国广大阶层的公众中引起了对资产阶级政党无休止的争吵的厌倦，它激起了沙文主义和民族主义的情绪。
    文章指出法国最近局势的发展并不是按照资产阶级政党事先准备好的计划进行的，戴高乐上台的方式并不是极右翼原来计划的方式。
    文章说，阿尔及利亚某些将军的叫嚣并不像人们原来设想的那样足以使戴高乐上台。为了使戴高乐上台还不得不利用社会党的领袖。大多数的人民是反对在法国实行独裁的，反动派从头至尾都不能不考虑到这种力量，在不久的将来它也将不能不考虑到这种力量。除了这些事实之外，也有必要指出戴高乐故意含糊不清地制定他的纲领和发表关于他无意当独裁者的声明。在法国，各种非常不同的社会力量在互相冲突和互相影响。法国的变化并没有改变世界力量对比的基本事实。正在有利于和平、民主和社会主义力量的情况下发展的众所周知的情况依旧未变。
    文章最后说，在任何情况下，都必须坚决相信有民主传统、革命精神和爱好自由的法国人民，坚决相信他们最大的党——共产党。法国在历史上经历了不同的时期，最后人民总是会胜利的。这在我们的时代比以前任何时候更是确定无疑的了。
