Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 26th: The new management system for Czechoslovakian industry and construction, which was implemented on April 1st of this year, has achieved initial results, and production tasks in many sectors have been completed better than before.

In the newly established economic units—enterprises and enterprise unions—shortcomings in production organization are now easier to overcome, cooperation between factories is improving, and workers are being assigned work more economically.

For example, the newly established Bicycle and Motorcycle Enterprise Union—which includes almost all of Czechoslovakia's bicycle and motorcycle production—has reduced production costs by more than one million crowns (Czechoslovakian currency) due to inter-enterprise competitions and close cooperation. Before the implementation of the new management system, the production costs of the enterprises under this enterprise union exceeded the original stipulation by approximately three million crowns in the first quarter of this year.

The largest shoe-making enterprise in Czechoslovakia, the Gottwaldov Dawn Shoe Factory, has greatly increased its management and decision-making power in production since the implementation of the new management system. It has established direct and close ties with the trade departments and produces various types of shoes for the trade departments faster than in the past, enabling people's needs to be met more quickly and better.

Currently, the phenomenon of overlapping production in the industrial sector is gradually being eliminated. For example, the production of air-conditioning equipment is now concentrated under one technical-economic unit, which allows for a more effective and economical distribution of the production plan between factories. At the same time, the implementation of the new management system has also made research work more directly and closely integrated with production.

    捷工业新管理制度实行近三个月来
    生产任务完成得很好
    新华社布拉格26日电　从今年4月1日起实行的捷克斯洛伐克工业和建筑业的新的管理制度已经取得初步成果，许多部门的生产任务都比以前完成得更好。
    在新成立的经济单位——企业和企业联合——中，组织生产方面的缺点现在更容易克服了，工厂之间的协作在改进，工人们也被更经济地安排工作。
    例如，新成立的自行车和摩托车企业联合——它几乎包括了捷克斯洛伐克全部自行车和摩托车的生产——由于进行了各企业间的竞赛和密切的协作，降低了生产成本一百多万克朗（捷币），而这个企业联合所属各企业在没有实行新的管理制度以前，今年第一季度的生产成本却超过原来规定约三百万克朗。
    捷克斯洛伐克最大的制鞋企业——哥特瓦尔德夫的曙光制鞋工厂，在实行新的管理制度后，生产上的管理权和决定权大大增加了。它和贸易部门建立了直接的密切联系，它比过去更快地为贸易部门生产各种鞋类，使人们的需求能更快更好地得到满足。
    目前，工业方面生产重叠的现象也逐渐消除了。例如，空气调节设备的生产现在是在一个技术——经济单位下集中进行，这就使这个单位的生产计划可以在各个工厂之间进行更有效的、更经济的分配。同时新管理制度的实行也使得研究工作更直接而密切地和生产相结合。
