Elephant Ivory Mango

The mango is known as the king of tropical fruits. The Elephant Ivory Mango is a gem among mangoes. The only place in China where this precious fruit is produced is Jinggu County in the Lancang River basin, Yunnan Province.

In June, ordinary mangoes, slightly larger than eggs, are already on the market in large quantities, but Elephant Ivory Mangoes will not be ripe for another month. In Manmao Village, where Elephant Ivory Mangoes were first planted, every family has several trees in their courtyards. Hanging from the dense, cloud-like green foliage are light green fruits that look like cucumbers on a vine, except that the tip is slightly smaller and curves upwards, resembling an ivory tusk. When ripe, each of these mangoes is a foot long, as thick as a small bowl, and weighs about two pounds. One mango is enough to fill a person up. Although the fruit is several times larger than ordinary mangoes, the pit is smaller. When the thin skin is peeled away, the rich flesh drips with milky yellow juice. It melts in your mouth without chewing, and the taste is especially sweet.

Elephant Ivory Mangoes can bear fruit three years after planting, but they are not easy to cultivate. The survival rate of transplanted trees is very low, and they are difficult to preserve, rotting three or four days after ripening. Therefore, this precious fruit has not been widely promoted for a long time, and few people in China know about it.

Now, the Jinggu County agricultural technology departments are studying the cultivation techniques of Elephant Ivory Mangoes, and the county's local state-owned farm has begun planting them. The county also combines this effort with greening work, requiring each person in areas suitable for growing Elephant Ivory Mangoes to plant five trees this year, and each cooperative to plant five mu. The commercial departments are also studying refrigeration or other methods to extend the storage period in order to transport them in large quantities so that more people can eat Elephant Ivory Mangoes.

The picture on the right shows unripe Elephant Ivory Mangoes hanging on the branches.

    象牙芒果
    芒果号称热带水果之王。象牙芒果又是芒果中的珍品。这种珍贵水果在我国的唯一产地是云南省澜沧江流域的景谷县。
    6月，比鸡蛋稍大的普通芒果已经大量上市，但象牙芒果还要一个月才成熟。最先种植象牙芒果的曼冒村，家家庭院中都有几株象牙芒果。浓绿如云的叶丛中垂下一个个浅绿色的果实，真像瓜棚上的黄瓜，只是尖端稍小，并向上微翘，宛如一颗象牙。这种芒果成熟时每个长达一市尺，有小碗口粗，重量约两市斤，一人吃一个就尽饱了。果实虽比普通芒果大好几倍，但核却比普通芒果的小。剥开薄薄的果皮，丰厚的果肉就滴出乳黄色的蜜汁，放在嘴里不嚼它也会融化，味道分外香甜。
    象牙芒果种下三年便可结果，但不易栽培，移植的成活率很低，保管也比较困难，成熟后三、四天便发烂。因此，这种珍贵水果长期没有推广，国内知道它的人也不多。
    现在，景谷县农业技术部门正在研究象牙芒果的栽培技术，县地方国营农场已开始种植。县里还结合绿化工作，要求适合种象牙芒果地区，今年每人种五株，每社种五亩。商业部门也正在研究用冷藏或其它办法延长贮存期，以便大量外运，使更多的人吃到象牙芒果。
