Shanxi Province is vigorously developing local civil aviation. The first batch of routes, scheduled to open in July, includes Taiyuan to Changzhi, Taiyuan to Datong, and Taiyuan to Linfen. Next year, plans are also in place to open routes from Taiyuan to Yangquan, Taiyuan to Wuzhai, and others, forming a civil aviation network centered on Taiyuan. The Taiyuan to Changzhi route, the first to open, is scheduled for a trial flight on the 29th and will officially open on "July 1st." The Taiyuan Civil Aviation business unit has already begun registering passenger tickets and handling air transport business for this route.

Changzhi, Yangquan, Datong, Linfen and other cities connected by air routes centered on Taiyuan are important industrial bases in Shanxi Province. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, they will develop into medium-sized cities with a population of about 500,000. Currently, with the development of industrial construction and cultural undertakings, contacts between cities are gradually increasing, and transportation is very inconvenient. Taiyuan to Changzhi is more than 250 kilometers away, and it takes four days to travel back and forth by train or car. Because this road winds through the Taihang Mountains at an altitude of more than 900 meters, it is often blocked by rain and snow. After the opening of air service, this journey will be shortened to two hours. After the mail is changed to air transport, 90% of the counties and cities in the province can see the Shanxi Daily published in Taiyuan on the same day, which is more than twice as fast as the original transportation speed.

Civil aviation in Shanxi Province is jointly operated by the provincial and municipal transportation departments, striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results while paying attention to safety. The airport built in Changzhi City was built by cadres, students, and local farmers from the special zone and Lu'an County as voluntary labor. The construction time was greatly shortened, and the construction cost was reduced from the general 100,000 yuan to about 20,000 yuan.

### 山西举办短途民航交通  七月份辟三条航线　明年建成民航网

    山西举办短途民航交通
    七月份辟三条航线　明年建成民航网
    本报太原27日电　山西省大举兴办地方民航交通事业。第一批在7月份通航的有太原到长治、太原到大同和太原到临汾三条航线；明年还计划开辟太原到阳泉、太原到五寨等线，组成以太原市为中心的民航网。最先通航的太原到长治的航线，计划在29日试航，“七一”正式通航。现在，太原民航营业单位已经开始登记客票，办理这条航线的航运业务。
    以太原市为中心通航的长治、阳泉、大同、临汾等城市，都是山西省的重要工业基地，第二个五年计划期间，将发展成为五十万人左右的中等城市。现在，随着工业建设和文化事业的发展，各城市联系事务逐渐增多，交通很感不便。太原到长治市二百五十多公里，乘火车或汽车往返一次，需时四天；由于这条公路蜿蜒在海拔九百多公尺的太行山丛，还常受雨雪阻隔。通航以后，这段旅程立即缩短到两小时。邮件改为航运以后，全省90％的县市能在当天看到在太原出版的山西日报，比原来交通速度快了两倍多。
    山西省民用航空由省市交通运输部门联合经营，在注意安全的同时力求多快好省。长治市修建的机场就是由专区和潞安县机关干部、学生和当地农民出义务工修建的。修建时间大大缩短，修建费也从一般十万元减少到两万元左右。
