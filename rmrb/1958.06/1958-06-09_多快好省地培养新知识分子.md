　　To carry out technological and cultural revolutions, we must enable the working people to learn culture and technology. In some factories in Tianjin, half-work, half-study schools have emerged, which is a new form for workers to learn culture and technology more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　Through production practice, workers and peasants have a deep understanding of the performance characteristics of the tools at hand. Therefore, they can constantly improve their tools in practice. However, due to the lack of cultural knowledge, their achievements in tool reform are far from meeting the requirements of the current great leap forward in production. Once workers and peasants learn cultural and technical knowledge, based on their familiarity with various tools at hand, a great revolution will inevitably occur in production technology. Therefore, it must be recognized that it is of extremely great significance for workers and peasants to learn culture and science for technological revolution, cultural revolution, and the country's socialist economic construction.

　　However, not everyone understands the importance of running half-work, half-study schools in factories. They worry that running such schools in factories will disrupt production order. They also worry that workers' enthusiasm for production will be affected after their wages are reduced accordingly, and so on. In fact, these concerns are unnecessary. The actual experience of the No. 1 State Cotton Factory in Tianjin in running half-work, half-study schools tells us that as long as the leadership pays attention and arranges production specifically, it will not disrupt the production order. As for the wage issue, most of the workers who sign up for half-work, half-study are young people, and their family economic burden is not too heavy. In order to learn culture and technology, they are willing to sacrifice some income temporarily. Some middle-aged and elderly workers have not given up the opportunity to learn culture and improve technology because of the heavy family burden and reduced income. Yang Yunfa, a master of roving frame maintenance at the Tianjin No. 1 State Cotton Factory, said: "I have been working since I was thirteen years old, and I have been dealing with machines all day for more than sixteen years, but I don't understand mathematics, and I can't calculate the mechanical structure or the number of revolutions of the machine. Now that there is a good opportunity for half-work, half-study, even if life is a little difficult, I have to persist in learning and work hard in production." Worker Liu Hongru said it well: "If all the workers in the country who participate in learning receive wages during the learning time, how much expenditure would the country have to bear?" Some workers said that if wages are not reduced accordingly, there will only be "more," "faster," and "better," but not "more economically." In fact, without "more economically," the state's funds are limited, so it cannot be "more," "faster," and "better." When workers realize this, they will agree to reduce their wages accordingly. Many workers in Tianjin have seen this clearly, so they have consciously and voluntarily reduced their wages for learning time.

　　Under the inspiration of the general line of socialist construction, everyone is making a great leap forward. In factories and enterprises, the development of cultural and educational undertakings should also be no exception. We hope that more half-work, half-study schools will be established in various places to improve workers' cultural and technical level.

　　多快好省地培养新知识分子
　　祖年
    要技术革命和文化革命，就要使劳动人民学文化学技术。天津市的一些工厂里，出现了半工半读学校，这是一种使工人多快好省地学文化学技术的新形式。
    工人农民通过生产实践，对自己手头的工具的性能特点有深刻的了解，因此他们在实践中能够不断地改进自己的工具。但是，由于缺乏文化知识，他们在工具改革方面的成就还远不能满足当前生产大跃进的要求。工人农民一旦学习了文化和技术知识，根据他们对手头各种工具的熟习程度，在生产技术上必然会出现一个大革命的局面。因此，必须看到，工人农民学文化、学科学，对技术革命、文化革命、对国家社会主义经济建设有极其重大的意义。
    但是，对在工厂中搞半工半读的重要意义，并不是所有人都了解的。他们担心在工厂中举办这种学校，会打乱生产秩序。他们还担心工人的工资相应减少后，生产积极性会受到影响等等。其实，这种担心是不必要的。天津市国棉一厂举办半工半读学校的实际经验告诉我们，只要领导重视，具体的把生产安排好，是不会打乱生产秩序的。至于工资问题，报名半工半读的工人多数是青年，他们的家庭经济负担并不太重，为了学文化学技术，就是暂时影响一些收入，他们也是愿意的。有些中年老年工人，也并没有因为家庭负担重，减少收入而放弃学文化提高技术的机会。天津国棉一厂粗纱保全老师傅杨云发说：“我从十三岁就做工，干了十六年多，成天跟机器打交道，可是不懂数学，计算机械构造或机器转数就算不上来。现在有了半工半读的好机会，即便生活有一点困难，也要坚持学习和努力生产”。工人刘鸿儒说得好：“如果全国参加学习的工人，在学习时间内都拿工资，国家得多大的一笔支出呀。”有的工人说，如果不相应地减少工资，那就只有“多”“快”“好”，而没有“省”了。其实，没有了“省”，国家资金有限，也就不能“多”“快”“好”了。工人认识到这一点的时候，他们是会同意相应地减少工资的。天津的许多工人就看明白了这一点，因此他们已经自觉自愿地减去学习时间的工资。
    在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，人人都在跃进，在工厂企业中，发展文化教育事业也不能例外，希望各地多办提高工人文化、技术水平的半工半读学校。
