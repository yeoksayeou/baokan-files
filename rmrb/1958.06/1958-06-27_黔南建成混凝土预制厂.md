    Qiannan Completes Concrete Prefabrication Plant
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The concrete prefabrication plant built in Duyun, the capital of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, recently commenced production. The plant uses domestically produced high-strength steel wire, high-grade cement, and high-quality quartz sand produced in Duyun to produce concrete bridges and steel-string prestressed concrete sleepers to supply the railway construction needs of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and other places.
    The prefabrication plant for steel-string prestressed concrete sleepers is a new industry in our country. The use of concrete sleepers in railway construction can save the country a large amount of timber.
    This plant was built by the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways' Newly Built Railways.

    黔南建成混凝土预制厂
    据新华社讯　建立在黔南布依族苗族自治州首府——都匀的混凝土预制工厂，在不久前投入生产。这座工厂采用国产高强度钢丝、高标号水泥和都匀出产的质量良好的石英砂子，生产混凝土桥梁和钢弦式预应力混凝土轨枕，以供应云南、贵州、广西等地铁路建设的需要。
    钢弦式预应力混凝土轨枕的预制工厂，在我国是一种新兴工业。在铁路建筑中采用混凝土轨枕，可以为国家节约大量木材。
    这座工厂是铁道部新建铁路第二工程局建设的。
