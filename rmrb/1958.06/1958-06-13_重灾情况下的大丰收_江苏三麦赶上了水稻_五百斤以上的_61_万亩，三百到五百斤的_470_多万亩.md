    A Great Harvest Under Severe Disaster
    Jiangsu's Three Wheat Crops Catch Up with Rice
    610,000 Mu Yielding Over 500 Jin, 4.7 Million Mu Yielding 300 to 500 Jin

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 12th) Reporter Gu Ping reports: The slogan "Three Wheat Crops Catch Up with Rice" has blossomed and borne fruit in Jiangsu Province, achieving a double harvest of grain and ideology. Although encountering the most severe diseases in twenty-two years this year, the total output of 50 million mu of summer crops in the province still reached 8.7 billion jin, an increase of 43.5% over last year. The per mu yield of several million mu of three wheat crops has caught up with and approached the local rice yield of last year. This first shot of victory this year shattered the myth that three wheat crops are low-yield crops, and at the same time, made the retreat faction lower their flags and the onlookers shut their mouths.

    Now, the three wheat crops in the province have successively appeared on the market. Reports of bumper harvests continue to come from various places. According to preliminary statistics, there are 610,000 mu of three wheat crops in the province with an average yield of over 500 jin per mu, and more than 4.7 million mu with an average yield of 300 to 500 jin (the average yield of rice in the province last year was 362 jin). The number of counties (cities) with an average yield of less than 100 jin has dropped from 34 last year to 2. This year, the total output of three wheat crops in Suzhou Prefecture is more than 1.6 billion jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year. Changshu County, known throughout the country for its ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point efforts, overcame severe scab and stem rust, with an average yield of 310 jin per mu, an increase of 139% over last year.

    This year, Jiangsu Province cultivated three wheat crops with the same energy as cultivating rice. In the past, many people regarded three wheat crops as low-yield crops, especially in southern Jiangsu, a rice-producing area, where there was a serious tendency to value rice over three wheat crops. A folk rhyme in Wuxian County says: "A grain of wheat has two sharp ends, stays in the field for half a year, no one cares about wind and rain, and only a little is harvested," which fully illustrates the extensive cultivation of three wheat crops. In order to change this situation, as early as November last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress issued a fighting call to the people of the province to "strive for a bumper harvest of three wheat crops and fire the first shot of the great leap forward in production in 1958." In March this year, the 23 township Party committees of Changshu County in southern Jiangsu took the lead, broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and proposed a competition initiative to the province to "have three wheat crops catch up with rice and double the rice yield." This initiative was echoed by more than 30,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province. Most areas of the province unprecedentedly cultivated three wheat crops with the same effort as cultivating rice, and conscientiously implemented various technical measures. During the successive three wheat cultivation assault months and assault weeks, the three wheat fields in the province were hoed and earthed up three times on average, and the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached 40,000 jin. The counties that applied the most fertilizer applied it seven times, with an amount of 80,000 jin, far exceeding previous years, which rapidly changed the face of the third-class wheat fields, and the first-class wheat fields increased from the original 40% to more than 57%.

    Jiangsu Province has continuously overcome various serious natural disasters to win a bumper harvest of three wheat crops. In the face of a series of disasters, the broad masses of farmers were full of enthusiasm, and they fought against natural disasters with heroic slogans such as "It is up to man to accomplish things, man will conquer nature" and "Don't be discouraged by disasters, still strive for 800 jin." This year, one-third of the wheat fields in northern Jiangsu were unprecedentedly irrigated in the spring. The three wheat crops that suffered from frost damage quickly recovered their vitality after applying human manure and chemical fertilizers. The farmers in southern Jiangsu repeatedly repaired drainage ditches, basically achieving the requirement of dry fields after rain. In late April, large-scale campaigns to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests were launched in various places, using more than 70 million jin of pesticides, greatly reducing losses and achieving an unprecedented harvest.

    "Roads are made by walking, fields are cultivated by people, and the Great Leap Forward is achieved by hard work." This year, in the context of severe disasters, the bumper harvest of three wheat crops has led the broad masses of farmers to draw such a conclusion. Many agricultural cooperatives have also learned the lesson from the "saddle shape" of three wheat crops production in the past three years that it is necessary to go all out and strive for the top. In 1956, the total output of summer crops in the province was 6.6 billion jin. In 1957, a small "typhoon" swept through the countryside. Under natural conditions superior to 1956, the total output of summer crops decreased by 600 million jin. This year, a great effort was made, and it jumped to 8.7 billion jin. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site visit and evaluation meeting for county Party secretaries, systematically summarized the experience of the bumper harvest of three wheat crops, studied the plan for increasing the production of three wheat crops next year, and proposed the action slogan of "300 jin targets, 500 jin measures, and 1,000 jin efforts," and will greatly improve the total output of summer crops in the province next year.

### 重灾情况下的大丰收  江苏三麦赶上了水稻  五百斤以上的61万亩，三百到五百斤的470多万亩

    重灾情况下的大丰收
    江苏三麦赶上了水稻
    五百斤以上的61万亩，三百到五百斤的470多万亩
    本报南京12日电　记者古平报道：“三麦赶水稻”的跃进口号已经在江苏省开花结果，粮食和思想获得了双丰收。今年虽遇到了二十二年来所未有的严重病害，全省五千万亩夏熟作物总产量仍达八十七亿斤，比去年增产43.5％。数百万亩三麦的单产已赶上和接近了当地去年水稻的产量。今年这第一声胜利的响炮，一举击破把三麦看成是低产作物的迷信，同时，使促退派掩旗息鼓，观潮派闭口无言。
    现在，全省三麦已先后登场。丰产的捷报不断从各地传来。据初步统计，全省平均单产五百斤以上的三麦有六十一万亩，三百斤到五百斤的有四百七十多万亩（去年全省水稻平均单产三百六十二斤）。平均单产一百斤以下的县（市）已经由去年的三十四个下降到二个。苏州专区今年三麦总产量十六亿多斤，比去年增产一倍多。以十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲闻名全国的常熟县，战胜了严重的赤霉病和秆锈病，全县平均单产达到三百一十斤，比去年增产139％。
    江苏省今年以培植水稻的劲头培植三麦。过去有不少人把三麦看成是低产作物，特别在水稻产区的苏南，存在着严重的重水稻轻三麦的思想。吴县有首打油诗说：“一粒小麦两头尖，放在田中大半年，风吹雨打无人问，收了下来一点点”，充分说明了三麦耕作的粗放程度。为了改变这种情况，早在去年11月，江苏省党代表大会就向全省人民发出了“争取三麦大丰收，打响1958年生产跃进第一炮”的战斗号召。今年3月份，苏南常熟县二十三个乡党委一马当先，破除迷信，思想解放，向全省提出了“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的竞赛倡议。这一倡议在全省三万多个农业社中得到了响应。全省大多数地区史无前例地做到用培植水稻的功夫培植三麦，扎扎实实地贯彻了各项技术措施。在连续几次三麦培植突击月、突击周中，全省三麦田平均锄草、壅土三次，每亩平均施肥量达到四万斤，最多的县施肥达七次，施肥量达八万斤，大大超过了往年，使三类麦田迅速改变了面貌，一类麦田由原来的40％增加到57％以上。
    江苏省连续战胜了各种严重的自然灾害，才赢得三麦丰收。在一连串的灾害面前，广大农民干劲冲天，他们提出：“事在人为、人定胜天”，“受灾不灰心、照干八百斤”等英雄口号和自然灾害作斗争。苏北今年有三分之一的麦田破格地进行了春灌。受到冻害的三麦经过追施人粪尿和化肥，迅速恢复了生机。苏南农民一次又一次地整修排水沟，基本上达到雨过田干的要求。4月下旬，各地开展了大规模的防治病虫害的突击运动，用了七千多万斤药剂，大大减轻了损失，获得了空前丰收。
    “路是人走出来的，田是人种出来的，大跃进是人干出来的”，今年在重灾的情况下，三麦得到丰收，使广大农民得出了这样的结论。很多农业社也从近三年三麦产量出现的“马鞍形”中得出了必须鼓足干劲，力争上游的经验教训。1956年全省夏熟作物总产量是六十六亿斤，1957年农村中刮了一阵小“台风”，在自然条件优于1956年的情况下，夏熟作物总产量下降了六亿斤，今年大干了一场，一跃达八十七亿斤。最近，省委召开了县委书记现场参观评比会议，系统地总结了三麦丰收的经验，研究了明年三麦增产的规划，提出了“三百斤指标，五百斤措施，一千斤干劲”的行动口号，明年要把全省夏熟作物总产量大大提高一步。
