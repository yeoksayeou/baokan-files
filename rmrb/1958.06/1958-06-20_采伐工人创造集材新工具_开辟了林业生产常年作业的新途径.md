    Logging Workers Create New Timber Harvesting Tools
    Opening Up New Avenues for Year-Round Forestry Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Heilongjiang Daily: Logging workers Liu Qingfu, Zhang Xiangwen, and Liu Zhongmian, along with ironworker Li Shengyou and technician Gong Chaozhong from the Sankuishi Forestry Farm of the Chaihe Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province, have successfully created three new types of timber harvesting tools using indigenous methods: the "Non-Powered Aerial Cableway," the "Non-Powered Aerial Railway," and the "Powered Aerial Cableway." These innovations have opened up a new path for achieving year-round operations and developing forestry production in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    Due to natural conditions, most forestry production units in Heilongjiang Province cannot implement year-round operations. The timber harvested in a year can only be transported down the mountains in winter using horse-drawn sledges. Although a few units have adopted tractor-based timber harvesting to achieve year-round operations, they are powerless when it comes to harvesting in forest areas with slopes exceeding twelve degrees. This timber harvesting method is not only costly and requires large investments but also severely damages the ground surface and injures young trees. The three new timber harvesting tools successfully created by the employees of the Sankuishi Forestry Farm have many advantages: First, the production cycle is shortened by nine-tenths compared to horse-drawn sledges, solving the problem of timber accumulating on the mountains, deteriorating, and being downgraded. Second, since the timber is transported in the air, it avoids damage to the ground surface and protects young trees. Third, it reduces heavy manual labor and greatly improves production efficiency. Fourth, it is not restricted by terrain conditions, allowing large and small diameter timber from high mountain corners, rocky areas, and steep slopes to be transported down. This reduces timber waste and fully utilizes forest resources. Fifth, production costs are low. Using aerial cableways for timber harvesting reduces the harvesting cost per cubic meter by 34% compared to horse-drawn sledges. In addition, aerial cableways are simple in equipment, require small investments, are easy to operate, and are safe.

    采伐工人创造集材新工具
    开辟了林业生产常年作业的新途径
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报讯：黑龙江省柴河林业局三块石林场的采伐工人刘庆福、张祥文、刘忠眠，铁工李胜有和技术员宫朝中等用土办法创造成功“无动力架空索道”、“无动力架空铁道”和“有动力架空索道”三种集材新工具，为实现常年作业，多快好省地发展林业生产开辟了一条新途径。
    黑龙江省林业生产因受自然条件的限制，绝大多数单位不能实行常年作业，采伐一年的木材只能靠冬季用马套子运下山来，少数单位虽然采用拖拉机集材方式实行常年作业，可是它在十二度以上的坡度的林场集材就无能为力了。这种集材方式不仅投资大，成本高，而且还严重的破坏了地表，损伤了幼树。三块石林场职工们所创造成功的三种集材新工具优点很多：第一、生产周期比马套子运材缩短十分之九，解决了木材积压在山上、变质降低等级的问题。第二、由于它是在高空中运行木材，就避免地表的受破坏和保护了幼树。第三、减轻了笨重的体力劳动，大大的提高了生产效率。第四、它不受地势条件的限制，高山角、乱石塘和串坡困难的大小径木材都能运下来。这就减少了木材的浪费，充分利用了森林资源。第五、生产成本低。采用架空索道集材，每一立方公尺的集材成本比马套子集材的成本降低了34％。此外，架空索道这种工具设备简单，投资小，容易操作，又安全。
