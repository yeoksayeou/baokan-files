Xinhua News Agency, June 29th - At the Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference, which closed on the 18th, the Ministry of Internal Affairs rewarded eighty-four advanced counties, cities, municipal districts, and agricultural cooperatives that had done well in civil affairs work.

    The Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, recommended by Chairman Mao, received a banner with the inscription "Red Flag of Production for Disaster Relief" at the meeting. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also presented the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative with a universal tractor. The Yingju Agricultural Cooperative was originally an old disaster area with low-lying terrain, saline-alkali soil, and years of disasters. Before liberation, the lives of the masses were extremely poor. After liberation, especially after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, they relied on collective strength, everyone contributed ideas, and everyone put in effort. After two years of hard work, in 1957, they achieved a yield of 200 jin per mu. They guarantee a yield of 800 jin per mu this year and strive to reach 1,000 jin. Now, this cooperative has transformed saline-alkali land into a land of fish and rice, eliminated disasters, removed the label of disaster area, and fundamentally changed the natural landscape and the face of poverty. The experience of Yingju Cooperative in relying on collective strength to overcome disasters and organize a comprehensive Great Leap Forward has become a banner for production and disaster relief work nationwide.

    Among the rewarded areas, there are advanced units that have done well in all aspects of civil affairs work, as well as units that have done well in several or one aspect of civil affairs work. Those who have done well in all aspects of civil affairs work include twenty-six advanced units such as Changsha City in Hunan Province, Funing County in Hebei Province, Baoji City in Shaanxi Province, Fuquan County in Guizhou Province, Xinhui County in Guangdong Province, and Huangyuan County in Qinghai Province. Changsha City's Home for the Disabled and Elderly, Children's Home, and welfare work for the blind are all well-done. The city has established six blind people's production units, with nearly two hundred blind people participating in production. All the demobilized soldiers received by Changsha City in recent years have been properly resettled, and attention has been paid to the political and ideological education of demobilized soldiers. More than 90% of the demobilized soldiers have become active elements on various production fronts and work posts. As of the beginning of May, Changsha City has established 220 production units for family members of martyrs and soldiers and the poor, with more than 8,600 people participating in production. It is expected that all the poor in the city can achieve self-sufficiency within this year without state relief. Funing County in Hebei Province has established study stations and short-term training classes for demobilized soldiers, carried out appraisals and competitions, and strengthened ideological education for demobilized soldiers. Currently, more than 43% of the demobilized soldiers in the county have served as leading cadres in townships, cooperatives, and production teams, and more than 95% are active elements in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. In the Great Leap Forward in production, this county formed eight production leap forward field corps with disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers as the backbone and militiamen as the foundation, and compiled 116 companies such as "Satellite" and "Tiger." They go to support wherever there are difficulties, which powerfully promoted the Great Leap Forward in production. Funing County has also helped demobilized soldiers solve many specific difficulties. For example, it organized Chinese and Western doctors to provide mobile treatment for more than 800 demobilized soldiers suffering from chronic diseases, enabling them to quickly recover their health. Funing County's "Five Guarantees" and other social welfare work are also well-done. In 1956, it established "Five Guarantees" households and nursing homes to ensure the lives of widowed, orphaned, and childless cooperative members. Changsha City and Funing County were both presented with banners by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the inscription: "Go all out, aim high, and develop civil affairs work in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way."

    Fifty-eight advanced units have done well in several or one aspect of civil affairs work. Those who have done well in preferential treatment and demobilization work include Jilin City, Fengzhen County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningguo County in Anhui Province, Zunhua County in Hebei Province, Shawan County in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Sheyang County in Jiangsu Province. Those who have done well in the care of the disabled, elderly, and children, and welfare work for the blind, deaf, and mute include Nanning City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Linqing City in Shandong Province, and Fuzhou City in Fujian Province. Those who have done well in disaster relief work include Hengshan County in Hunan Province, Fengqiu County in Henan Province, and Datong County in Qinghai Province. Those who have done well in the economic recovery and construction of old revolutionary base areas and the arrangement of production and life for poor rural households include Yingshan County in Sichuan Province, Xingguo County in Jiangxi Province, and Zhen'an County in Shaanxi Province. Those who have done well in social welfare production work include Xuzhou City, Jinan City, Wenzhou City, Zhengzhou City, Xiangfan City, Bengbu City, Kunming City, Changning District in Shanghai, and Xuanwu District in Beijing. In the areas where social welfare production work has been done well, all or basically all preferential treatment recipients and social relief recipients with labor ability have been organized to participate in social welfare production, and a new atmosphere of "every family is busy with production, and every household has no idle people" has emerged. Some areas have achieved self-sufficiency without state relief, turning consumers into producers and eliminating the poor. The advanced units that have done well in social welfare production work have all been presented with banners by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the inscription: "Vigorously develop the cause of social welfare production, eliminate poverty, and strive to realize a prosperous city for everyone."

    树立民政工作为社会主义建设事业服务的榜样
    内务部奖励八十四个先进单位
    新华社29日讯　在18日闭幕的第四次全国民政会议上，内务部奖励了八十四个民政工作做得好的先进县、市、市辖区和农业社。
    毛主席推荐的河南省封丘县应举农业社，在会上得到一面写着“生产救灾的红旗”的锦旗。内务部还赠给应举农业社一部万能拖拉机。应举农业社原是一个地势低洼、土质盐碱、连年遭灾的老灾区。解放以前，群众生活极端贫困。解放以后，特别是在农业合作化高潮以后，他们依靠集体力量，人人献计，个个出力，经过两年的苦战，1957年已作到亩产二百斤。他们保证今年亩产八百斤，争取达到一千斤。现在这个社已把盐碱地改变为鱼米之乡，消灭了灾荒，摘掉了灾区帽子，从根本上改变了自然面貌和贫困生活的面貌。应举社的依靠集体力量战胜灾荒组织全面大跃进的经验，已成为全国生产救灾工作的一面旗帜。
    在受到奖励的地区中，有全面民政工作做得好的先进单位，也有几项或一项民政工作做得好的单位。全面民政工作做得好的，有湖南省长沙市、河北省抚宁县、陕西省宝鸡市、贵州省福泉县、广东省新会县、青海省湟源县等二十六个先进单位。长沙市的残老教养院、儿童教养院和盲人福利工作都作得好，全市已建立六个盲人生产单位，有将近二百名盲人参加了生产。长沙市几年来接收的复员军人已全部妥善安置，并很注意对复员军人的政治思想教育工作，现已有90％以上的复员军人成为各个生产战线和工作岗位上的积极分子。截至5月上旬止，长沙市已建立烈属、军属、贫民生产单位二百二十个，八千六百多人参加了生产，预计全市贫民在今年内可以全部做到自给，不要国家救济。河北省抚宁县建立了复员军人学习站、短期训练班，进行了评比竞赛，加强了对复员军人的思想教育工作，目前全县已有43％以上的复员军人担任了乡、社和生产队的领导干部，95％以上是农业生产大跃进中的积极分子。这个县在生产大跃进中以残废军人、复员军人为骨干，以民兵为基础组成了八个生产跃进野战兵团，编成了“卫星”、“猛虎”等一百一十六个连队，哪里有困难就到哪里去支援，有力地促进了生产大跃进。抚宁县还帮助复员军人解决了很多具体困难，如对八百多名患慢性病的复员军人，组织中西医生给予巡回治疗，使他们迅速恢复了健康，抚宁县的“五保”和其他社会福利工作也作得较好，1956年就创办“五保”户、养老院，使鳏寡孤独的社员生活有了保障，长沙市和抚宁县都得到了内务部赠送的锦旗，旗上写着：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地展开民政工作”。
    几项或一项民政工作作得好的有五十八个先进单位，优抚、复员工作作得好的有吉林市、内蒙古自治区丰镇县、安徽省宁国县、河北省遵化县、新疆维吾尔自治区沙湾县、江苏省射阳县等；残老、儿童教养工作和盲聋哑人的福利工作作得好的有广西僮族自治区南宁市、山东省临清市、福建省福州市等；救灾工作作得好的有湖南省衡山县、河南省封丘县、青海省大通县等；老根据地的经济恢复建设工作和对农村贫困户的生产、生活安排工作作得好的有四川省营山县、江西省兴国县、陕西省镇安县等。社会福利生产工作作得好的有徐州市、济南市、温州市、郑州市、襄樊市、蚌埠市、昆明市、上海市的长宁区、北京市的宣武区等。在社会福利生产工作作得好的地区内，已经全部或基本上把有劳动力的优抚补助对象和社会救济对象都组织起来参加了社会福利生产，出现了“家家忙生产，户户无闲人”的新气象。有些地区已做到自给，不要国家救济，使消费者变为生产者，消灭了贫民。社会福利生产工作做得好的先进单位都得到了内务部赠送的锦旗，旗上写着：“大力开展社会福利生产事业，消灭贫困，为实现人人富裕的城市而奋斗”。
