　　Door-to-Door Rectification

　　Zhang Jiehua was a production team leader in the Yanzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Xixian County, Henan Province. Because he was arrogant and complacent and failed to unite the masses, the team suffered a loss of 500 yuan in 1957. Although his shortcomings and mistakes had been criticized and educated several times by the branch committee and cooperative members' meetings, they were not thoroughly overcome. Whenever the team members mentioned Zhang Jiehua's shortcomings and mistakes, they shook their heads and said, "Difficult to correct! Difficult to correct!"

　　After the rural party rectification and socialist education movement entered the rectification and reform stage of opposing waste and conservatism, the cooperative members discussed animatedly: "This time we should give Team Leader Zhang some opinions." The team's airing of views meeting began. Yan Qingshan, a member of the team committee, spoke first: "Although Zhang Jiehua's work is good, he has arrogant emotions and subjectivism. I am also a member of the team committee, but he doesn't consult with me on anything. Wealthy middle peasant Yan Kunshan didn't cherish public property and let the cart get damaged in the rain. I said to deduct fifty work points from him, but you firmly disagreed, resulting in the cooperative members not abiding by labor discipline." Cooperative member Chen Zhongyuan said: "Team Leader Zhang is too subjective. My father was sick and I went to see a doctor, returning in the morning without delaying production, so why did you deduct two work points from me?" At this time, Zhang Jiehua heard one opinion after another, his heart pounding, his mind buzzing. He couldn't listen anymore, stood up, and strode away, leaving the team members feeling very disappointed.

　　After Zhang Jiehua returned home, the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He thought: How can I face people if my shortcomings are exposed in a public meeting? Won't I be punished if the higher authorities find out? From then on, he seemed to have become a bit ill. When the branch discovered his state of mind, it immediately convened a branch meeting. At the meeting, all the party members criticized his shortcomings and mistakes, as well as his wrong attitude towards criticism. After further explaining the great significance of the rectification movement and pointing out the future, his mind was somewhat relieved. On the way home, he recalled his father working as a hired hand for the landlord, his mother taking his younger sister to beg for food, and his fifteen-year-old brother dying of exhaustion while working for the landlord. The Communist Party rescued my family from the pit of fire and cultivated me to join the Party and become a cadre, but instead, I am arrogant, complacent, and detached from the masses. How can I be worthy of the Party? As he thought, tears streamed down his face, and he said to himself: "From now on, I will resolutely listen to the Party's words, accept the opinions of the masses, correct my mistakes, and start anew."

　　That evening, Zhang Jiehua went from Zhang's house to Li's house, from the east end of the village to the west end, to convene a meeting to air views. At the meeting, Zhang Jiehua unexpectedly made a self-criticism. Everyone said that Zhang Jiehua had changed and wanted to help him. At that time, some gave opinions face-to-face at the meeting, while others returned to their homes to write big-character posters by lamplight. That night, the cooperative members wrote more than 150 big-character posters, giving him more than 250 opinions.

　　The next morning, Zhang Jiehua came to the home of cooperative member Chen Zhongyuan with a feeling of shame. After chatting for a few words, Zhang Jiehua said: "From now on, I will often come to the homes of cooperative members to have heart-to-heart talks. I fully accept the opinions you raised at the airing of views meeting the other day. It was right for you to see a doctor for your sick father, and I will give you back the deducted work points." Chen Zhongyuan was very happy to hear this and said repeatedly: "As long as you correct yourself, I will say everything in my heart." Then he raised two more opinions.

　　That morning, Zhang Jiehua also went to Yan Qingshan's home. He made a self-criticism to Yan Qingshan, saying: "In the past, I was arrogant and complacent and didn't consult with you on anything. I will correct this in the future. As for the matter of wealthy middle peasant Yan Kunshan damaging the cart in the rain, let the cooperative members discuss it again to see if we should deduct fifty work points from him." Yan Kunshan also made a self-criticism on the spot for his lack of initiative. The two of them agreed to discuss things more and hold more self-criticism meetings in the future, and to listen to the opinions of the masses. From then on, they were as united as one. Zhang Jiehua visited more than twenty households in this way. The cooperative members reflected: "He corrects his mistakes when he has them, he is still a good cadre of Chairman Mao."

　　登门整改
    张杰华是河南息县阎寨农业社的一个生产队长，由于他骄傲自满，不团结群众，1957年全队赔产五百元。他这些缺点和错误虽经过支部会、社员会几次批评和教育，仍没有得到彻底克服。每当队员们提起张杰华的缺点和错误时，都摇晃着脑袋说：“难改正！难改正！”
    农村整党整社进入反浪费、反保守的整改阶段以后，社员们都七嘴八舌的酝酿着：“这次可该给张队长提提意见了”。队里的鸣放会议开始了。队委委员阎清山先发言说：“张杰华工作虽然好，但有骄傲情绪和主观主义，我也是个队委哩，有啥事都不给我商量。富裕中农阎昆山不爱惜公物，把小车子让雨淋坏了，我说扣他五十个工分，你坚决不愿意，结果使社员都不遵守劳动纪律。”社员陈中元发言说：“张队长太主观，我因父亲有病去请医生，早晨去早晨回，也没有耽误生产，为什么要扣我两个工分呢？”这时，张杰华听到一个接一个的意见后心里“扑通！扑通”乱跳，脑子里轰轰响，再也听不下去了，站起来，气昂昂地走开了，弄得队员们一个大没趣。
    张杰华回到家里后，越想越气，他想：缺点在大会上揭出来咋见人，上级知道了能不受处分吗？打从这以后，好像给添上几分病一样。当支部发现了他的这种思想情况后，立即召开支部会议，会上，全体党员针对他的缺点和错误以及他对待批评的错误态度开展了批评，又向他进一步讲明整风的伟大意义和指明前途后，他的思想才算轻松了些。在归家的路上，他回忆父亲给地主扛长工，母亲拉着妹妹去讨饭，十五岁的哥哥给地主干活累死了，共产党把我一家从火坑内救出来，培养我入了党，当上了干部，反而我骄傲自大，脱离群众，这能对得起党吗？他想着想着流下泪来，自言自语地说：“今后我坚决听党的话，接受群众的意见，改正错误，重新作人。”
    当天晚上，张杰华就张家跑到李家，从庄东头跑到庄西头，召集社员开鸣放会。会上，张杰华出人意料之外的做了检讨，大家都说张杰华转变了，要帮助他。当时，有的在会场当面提意见，有的回到屋内点灯写大字报。这一晚上，社员们共写出大字报一百五十多张，共给他提意见二百五十多条。
    第二天早上，张杰华怀着羞愧的心情来到社员陈中元家里。闲谈几句后，张杰华说：“今后我要常到社员家里来谈心。前天鸣放会上你提的意见我完全接受，你父亲有病去请医生是应该的，扣你的工分还给你补上。”陈中元听到这里后，心里很高兴。连声说：“只要你改正，我心里的话都要说完它”。接着他又提了两条意见。
    这天上午，张杰华又到了阎清山家，他向阎清山检讨说：“过去我骄傲自满，有事不和你商量，今后要改正，富裕中农阎昆山淋坏小车的事，再让社员讨论一下还可扣他五十个工分。”阎昆山也当面检讨了自己不主动的缺点。他俩商量，今后有事多研究，多开检讨会。多听取群众意见，打这以后他俩团结得像一个人一样，张杰华就这样登门访问了二十多户，社员们反映：“有错误就改正，还是毛主席的好干部”。  （摘自河南日报）
