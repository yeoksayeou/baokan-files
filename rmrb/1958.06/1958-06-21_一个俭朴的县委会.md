    A Frugal County Committee
    Tian Zhuang
    Before I went to Jun County, Hubei Province, I had heard many stories about the simple work style of the Jun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, I paid a visit and gained a deeper impression.
    Jun County is located next to the Han River. The famous Wudang Mountain is within the county's borders. That day, I arrived in Jun County and found the office address of the Jun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in a dilapidated, one-story house that was completely identical to the surrounding civilian houses. If there hadn't been a sign hanging at the door, I simply wouldn't have believed that the leading organ of a county was stationed here. After settling down, I learned about the situation, and Liang Shengfeng, the secretary of the county party committee, enthusiastically gave an introduction.
    In the years since liberation, the county party committee hasn't built a single new house. Is this because there were many houses originally? No. Before 1955, the county party committee had only five departments, totaling about fifty people, and even then it was quite crowded. Later, with the needs of the development of agricultural cooperativization, the county party committee suddenly increased from the original five departments to ten; the number of cadres nearly doubled, and housing became even more crowded. The county party committee worked out a solution. They turned large rooms into small rooms, separated the small building used for storing things with bamboo fences, pasted newspapers on them, and turned them into offices. They also vacated the three large rooms used as kitchens and turned the former horse-feeding place into a printing room. In this way, everyone勉强(mianqiang- reluctantly, barely) managed to live there.
    I visited several departments of this organization and found that not only were the office spaces small, but the equipment was also very simple. Three-drawer desks are considered top-grade desks here, and some departments work collectively, propping up old signboards to use as tables. Almost all the benches everyone sits on are unpainted long benches; not to mention chairs, even square stools are rare. The conference table in the meeting room is pieced together from two large square tables of different heights. It is said that the secretary had suggested making a new one several times, but the secretaries refused. As for daily necessities, they are even more reluctant to buy them. In the years since liberation, they have never bought a bed. Leading cadres and ordinary cadres all sleep on plank beds. I made a special visit to the room of First Secretary Chen Yuwen. The equipment in this room is considered relatively good. A plank bed almost occupies one-third of the entire room, with a faded desk in front of the bed, and books piled on another small table. A washbasin is placed on a long bench, and there is also a stool and an old-fashioned recliner. It is said that some people originally criticized the county party committee for being too unpretentious and too shabby. Some complained that the light in the house was not good and hurt their eyes, advocating building houses, but seeing the leading cadres so diligent and thrifty, they stopped saying anything.
    The leadership's work style has influenced all the organs in the county. In recent years, few new houses have been built by the county's organs. Most are dilapidated one-story houses, with offices and bedrooms together, and cadres live in collective dormitories.
    All organs in Jun County have very strict control over financial systems. The county party committee has had surpluses in operating expenses and public miscellaneous expenses every year for the past few years, saving more than 1,600 yuan last year alone. According to the regulations of the Provincial Department of Finance, those who travel on business within the county for more than fifty miles are subsidized five jiao for food expenses per person per day. This county implemented it for less than a year and found that people could rush back to the organs for meals between the county and districts, and between districts, so it took the initiative to abolish this regulation.
    What is the reason that makes the cadres of this county, especially the leading cadres, consistently so diligent and thrifty? When I raised this question, County Party Secretary Liang Shengfeng answered without hesitation, "Jun County is a mountainous area, and the living standards of the masses are currently not high. If we are special, we will be detached from the masses." At this time, I remembered what Jiao Dexiu, Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said to me on the way to Jun County: "The houses and equipment of all the organs in Jun County have not changed in recent years. They were the same in the past, and they are still the same now. However, the enthusiasm of the cadres here in leading the masses to carry out production and construction is greater every year than the last."

    一个俭朴的县委会
    田庄
    没到湖北省均县以前，我就听到有关中共均县县委会作风朴素的许多事迹。最近我去作了一次访问，获得了更深刻的印象。
    均县紧挨在汉水边上。著名的武当山就在这个县的境内。那天，我赶到均县，在一幢破旧的、和周围民房完全一样的平房中找到了中共均县县委会办公地址。如果不是门口挂着一个牌子，我简直不会相信一个县的领导机关就驻在这里。安顿下来以后，我了解了这方面的情况，县委书记梁生峰热情地作了介绍。
    解放几年来，县委会没盖过一间新房，这是不是因为原来房子多呢？不是。1955年以前，县委会只有五个部门，一共五十来人，那时住的就挺挤。后来，随着农业合作化发展的需要，县委会由原来的五个部门一下子增加到十个；干部增加近一倍，住房就更挤了。县委会研究出了解决的办法。他们把大房间改成小房间，把用来贮藏东西的小楼，用竹篱隔开，报纸糊上，改成办公室。又把作厨房用的三大间房子腾了出来，把以前喂马的地方，改成文印室。就这样，大家勉强住下来了。
    我参观了这个机关的几个部门，发觉不仅办公用房狭小，设备也很简陋。三屉桌在这里算是上等的办公桌，有的部门集体办公，把过去的匾支起来当桌子。大家坐的板凳几乎全是没油漆过的长条凳，别说椅子，就是方凳也很少。会议室中的会议桌是由两张高矮不一的大方桌拼凑起来的，据说秘书曾几次建议做个新的，都被书记们拒绝了。至于生活用品，他们更是舍不得添置。解放几年来，从没买过一张床，领导干部和一般干部睡的都是铺板。我特地参观了第一书记陈玉文的房间。这间房设备算是比较好的。一张铺板床几乎占去整个房间的三分之一，床前放着一张退了色的办公桌，另一张小桌上，堆放着书籍，在一条长条凳上放着脸盆，此外还有一把凳子和一张旧式躺椅。据说原来也有些人批评县委会太不讲排场，太寒酸。有的嫌房子光线不好，伤眼睛，主张盖房子，但看到领导干部如此勤俭朴素，也再不言语了。
    领导干部的这种作风，影响了全县所有的机关。几年来，全县各机关很少新盖房子，绝大部分都是破旧的平房，办公和寝室在一起，干部住的是集体宿舍。
    均县各机关对财务制度掌握十分严格。县委机关几年来在事业费、公杂费开支上，年年都有节余，去年一年就节余了一千六百多元。根据省财政厅规定，县境内出差超过五十里路程的，每人每天补助伙食费五角。这个县执行了不到一年，发觉县与区、区与区之间都可以赶到机关吃饭，便主动取消这一规定。
    是什么原因使这个县的干部，特别是领导干部，一贯这样勤俭朴素呢？当我把这个问题提出来的时候，县委书记梁生峰毫不思索地回答说：“均县是个山区，群众生活水平目前还不高，如果特殊了就会脱离群众。”这时，我想起在前往均县的途中，中共襄阳地委书记处书记焦德秀对我说的话：“均县所有机关的房子和设备几年来一直没有改变，过去是啥样，现在还是啥样。但是这里干部领导群众进行生产建设的干劲，却一年比一年大。”
