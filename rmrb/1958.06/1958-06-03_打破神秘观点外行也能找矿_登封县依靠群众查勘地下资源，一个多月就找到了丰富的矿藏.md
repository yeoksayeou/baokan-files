Breaking the Mystique: Laymen Can Also Find Minerals
    Dengfeng County Relies on the Masses to Prospect for Underground Resources, Finding Rich Mineral Deposits in Just Over a Month

    (Our Zhengzhou Dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party's Dengfeng County Committee in Henan Province, since the beginning of April, has organized cadres to go into the mountains and rely on the masses to prospect for underground resources, discovering hematite and many other mineral deposits with considerable reserves.

    Dengfeng County is located at the foot of Mount Song, with undulating mountains and many treasures. In the past, the masses had reported many mineral occurrences to the county, but at that time, the county believed that the development of underground treasures was a matter for the state and had been waiting for the state to send people to explore. Therefore, when the county decided this spring to make extensive use of local resources to run local industries on a large scale, the first problem encountered was unclear resources, making it impossible to determine the scale and site selection of many industrial projects. At that time, they repeatedly requested the province to send people to help with exploration, but the province could not spare anyone. Under these circumstances, in order to accelerate the construction of local industries, the Chinese Communist Party's Dengfeng County Committee changed its previous passive attitude of seeking assistance and decided to adopt a self-reliant approach to prospect for underground resources. At the beginning of April, taking advantage of the adjustment of the agencies, they extracted seventy cadres to form a geological exploration team. At the beginning, these cadres saw that no one in the team understood geological knowledge and exploration technology, and there were no technical personnel to guide them, so they lacked confidence. Some people also believed that geological work was something that specialized personnel did, and they did not understand the technology and could not achieve anything. In response to these situations, the Chinese Communist Party's Dengfeng County Committee criticized their mysterious view of geological exploration work. At the same time, they had a cadre from the Industrial Bureau who already understood general geological knowledge introduce them to mineral prospecting experience, and also gave them a set of mineral specimens, organized them to visit and practice on the spot. In just three days, they initially mastered general mineral prospecting knowledge, improved their confidence in doing a good job, and happily went to various mining areas for general survey.

    They started by reviewing the mineral points previously reported by the masses and relied on the masses for surveying. They extensively interviewed shepherds, cowherds, firewood cutters, and other experienced old farmers who often worked in the mountains to understand the surrounding geological conditions. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party's Dengfeng County Committee and the district and township party committees, respectively, mobilized the people of the county to report minerals through radio conferences and mass meetings. In just over twenty days, more than one hundred types were reported throughout the county. The county used various opportunities to exhibit these minerals among the masses and explain them to the masses, so that the masses mastered the basic knowledge of minerals.

    According to the current needs of Dengfeng County's local industrial development, this geological exploration team focused on surveying iron, manganese, phosphorus, and other mineral deposits. Because they adopted the method of exploring, mining, and smelting at the same time, the masses quickly saw the benefits and actively participated in the mineral exploration work. As of mid-May, more than seventy iron ore deposits had been found in the county's twenty-five townships, with an estimated reserve of more than 440 million tons. More than 160 test pits were dug in the iron ore area, and more than 111,000 tons of ore were excavated from the test pits. Agricultural cooperatives have already established more than one hundred and dozens of indigenous iron-smelting furnaces based on these resource conditions.

　　打破神秘观点外行也能找矿
    登封县依靠群众查勘地下资源，一个多月就找到了丰富的矿藏
    本报郑州讯  中共河南省登封县委员会，4月初以来组织干部上山，依靠群众查勘地下资源，查出了储量相当丰富的赤铁矿和许多其他矿藏。
    登封县位于嵩山脚下，境内山峦起伏，宝藏很多，过去群众曾向县里报了不少矿苗，那时由于县里认为开发地下宝藏是国家办的事，一直在等待国家派人来勘探。因此，当这个县在今年春天决定利用本地资源大量举办地方工业的时候，首先遇到的问题就是资源不清，使许多工业项目的规模、厂址无法确定。当时他们再三请求省里派人来帮助勘探，但是省里抽不出人来，在这种情况下，中共登封县委为了加速地方工业的建设，改变了以前那种消极求援的态度，决定采取自力更生的办法来查勘地下资源。4月初他们趁各机关调整机构之便，抽调出七十名干部组成了地质勘探队。开始的时候，这些干部看到队里没有一个人懂得地质知识和勘探技术，又没有技术人员指导，都信心不足。有的人还认为地质工作是专门人材干的事，自己不懂技术，干不出什么名堂。中共登封县委针对着这些情况，批判了他们那种对于地质勘探工作的神秘看法，同时，让工业局的一个已经懂一般地质知识的干部，向他们介绍了查矿经验，并且发给他们一套矿石标本，组织他们实地进行了参观、实习，仅三天的时间，他们就初步掌握了一般的查矿知识，提高了做好工作的信心，兴高彩烈地分赴各个矿区进行普查。
    他们首先从审查群众以前报的矿点开始，依靠群众进行查勘。他们广泛地访问了经常在山上牧羊、放牛、打柴的人和其他有找矿经验的老农，向他们了解周围的地质情况。与此同时，中共登封县委和区、乡党委，还分别通过广播大会、群众大会，发动全县人民报矿。只二十多天，全县就报出一百多种。县里利用各种机会将这些矿石在群众中展览，向群众讲解，使群众掌握了矿石的基本知识。
    根据当前登封县地方工业发展的需要，这个地质勘探队着重查勘了铁、锰、磷等矿藏。由于采取了边探、边采、边冶炼的方法，使群众很快地见到了效益，更加积极地参加了探矿工作。截至5月中旬，在全县二十五个乡内，查出铁矿七十余处，估计藏量有四亿四千余万吨。就在铁矿区打探井一百六十多眼，从探井里挖出矿石十一万一千多吨。农业社已经根据这些资源情况建立起一百几十座土法炼铁炉。
