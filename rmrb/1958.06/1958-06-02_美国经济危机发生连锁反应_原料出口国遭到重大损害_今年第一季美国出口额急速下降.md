Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 30th: According to TASS, "Time" magazine in the United States said in an article that due to the U.S. economic recession and reduced demand for raw materials, the U.S. commodity price index has fallen by 10% in the past year, which has caused financial crises in many raw material exporting countries in the capitalist world.

According to the magazine's materials, Chile's copper exports will decrease by $225 million this year, and Chile's trade deficit will reach $95 million. Bolivia's foreign exchange earnings depend 80% on the export of tungsten, lead, tin, and zinc, but the prices of these raw materials have fallen by 30%, so Bolivia is "also in the same economic difficulties."

The decline in coffee prices has also caused serious losses to the economies of many South American countries. And due to U.S. restrictions on oil imports, Venezuela's oil production has decreased by 14%, resulting in a loss of at least $250,000 per day for the country.

According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, mainly due to price declines, sixteen Asian countries had a deficit of $2.1 billion in the first half of 1957 alone, while the deficit for the entire year of 1955 was only $750 million. The proportion of this region (excluding Japan) in world trade decreased from 10.7% to 6.6%.

Pakistan has lost a large portion of its trade position due to the sharp drop in cotton prices and a 44% reduction in jute exports. Indonesia has been in economic difficulties since 1956 due to a 20% decline in rubber raw material prices.

Malaysia's tin exports have decreased by 50%. 25% of Malaysia's tin mines have already been closed. Malaysia's foreign trade once had a surplus, but now there is a deficit of $39 million.

"Time" magazine bluntly stated that countries affected by the U.S. economic recession cannot have any hope for the United States, because the United States not only does not intend to increase the purchase of raw materials, but also intends to establish new tariff barriers on raw material imports.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 31st: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the 29th that in the first quarter of 1958, the rate at which U.S. exports declined from the peak level at the beginning of 1957 accelerated. The total value of U.S. merchandise exports in the first quarter of 1958, calculated at an annual rate, was $16.4 billion, compared to $19 billion in the first quarter of 1957.

The report said that the items with reduced exports in the first quarter of this year were mainly industrial products and grains, including steel products, scrap iron, copper and other non-ferrous metals, coal, wheat, oilseeds, and cotton. The report pointed out that the reduction in oil exports was due to the disappearance of the "boom" in U.S. oil exports caused by the closure of the Suez Canal in 1956.

In terms of destination regions, the most severe declines were in exports to Western Europe and Japan. Exports to Western Europe in the first quarter of 1958 decreased by 31% compared to the same quarter of 1957, and exports to Japan decreased by 39%. Exports to Latin America also decreased.

    美国经济危机发生连锁反应
    原料出口国遭到重大损害
    今年第一季美国出口额急速下降
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社纽约30日讯：美国“时代”杂志在一篇文章中说，由于美国经济衰退，原料需求减少，美国的商品价格指数在最近一年下降了10％，这就引起了资本主义世界许多原料出口国的财政危机。
    根据这家杂志的材料，智利铜的出口今年将减少二亿二千五百万美元，并将使智利的贸易逆差高达九千五百万美元。玻利维亚的外汇有80％是靠输出钨、铅、锡、锌获得的，而这些原料的价格已经下跌30％，因此玻利维亚“也处在同样的经济困难中”。
    咖啡价格的下降也使许多南美国家的经济遭到严重损失。而由于美国限制石油进口，委内瑞拉的石油开采量减少了14％，因而使这个国家每天遭受至少二十五万美元的损失。
    据联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会的统计，主要由于价格下跌，十六个亚洲国家单单在1957年上半年就有二十一亿美元的赤字，而1955全年的赤字只有七亿五千万美元。这一地区（日本除外）在世界贸易中所占的比重从10.7％降到6.6％。
    巴基斯坦由于棉花价格猛跌和黄麻出口减少了44％，因而丧失了很大一部分贸易阵地。印度尼西亚由于橡胶原料价格下降20％，从1956年起就处于经济困难状态。
    马来亚锡的出口减少了50％。马来亚锡矿有25％已经关闭。马来亚的对外贸易曾经有过顺差，现在却出现三千九百万美元的逆差。
    “时代”杂志直截了当地说，遭到美国经济衰退影响的国家对美国不可能有什么指望，因为美国不仅不打算增加原料的采购数量，而且还准备对原料进口建立新的关税壁垒。
    新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部29日宣布，在1958年的第一季度，美国出口从1957年年初的最高水平往下降的速度加速了。1958年第一季度美国的商品出口总额以年率计算为一百六十四亿美元，而1957年第一季度是一百九十亿美元。
    报告说，今年第一季出口减少的项目主要是工业品和粮食，其中包括钢铁产品、废铁、铜和其他有色金属、煤、小麦、油籽和棉花。报告指出，石油出口的减少是由于1956年苏伊士运河封闭而引起的美国石油出口的“景气”的消失。
    就运往的地区而论，下降得最厉害的是对西欧和日本的出口。对西欧的出口在1958年第一季度比1957年同一季度下降了31％，对日本的出口下降了39％。对拉丁美洲的出口也有所减少。
