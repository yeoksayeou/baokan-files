Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th – The National Schistosomiasis Prevention Work On-Site Conference was recently held in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province. Leading cadres and experts and professors responsible for schistosomiasis prevention work from twelve provinces and cities across the country carefully reviewed past work, summarized and exchanged experience in prevention work and scientific research results, and, on the basis of unified thinking and understanding, formulated a proposed plan for strengthening prevention work nationwide.

According to the conference materials, this spring, the national schistosomiasis prevention work has made a great leap forward. Forty-five counties and cities across the country have basically eliminated snails, and combined with snail eradication, more than 200 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated, and more than 700,000 mu of cultivated land has been increased. This spring, more than 560,000 patients were treated nationwide, exceeding the total number of treatments for the entire year last year. Hunan Province has done an even better job in carrying out a treatment efficiency campaign centered on technological innovation. By the end of May, the province had treated more than 120,000 patients, more than four and a half times the total number of treatments during the same period last year. Xiangyin County also promoted the advanced treatment method of "six jiao of money, three jin of rice, curing a patient in three days" which is fast, economical, and effective. In May, the county created a national high efficiency rate of an average of more than 3,420 patients treated per team (each team of three or four medical personnel), and ensured that each patient was safely discharged from the hospital. Currently, fifteen counties and cities across the country have basically eliminated schistosomiasis. The facts powerfully refute all kinds of pessimistic arguments and conservative ideas, proving that accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis is entirely possible.

The meeting believes that in the current new situation where various places are extensively cultivating lakes and islands and the opportunities for the masses of farmers to come into contact with epidemic water are increasing day by day, how to strengthen prevention work, eliminate new infections, consolidate treatment results, and accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis has become an urgent task. According to incomplete statistics from five provinces including Hunan and Hubei, more than 600,000 farmers who engaged in production in contact with epidemic water this spring generally did not find any new infected patients because they strengthened their protective work. The main experience of prevention work in various places is that it must be done under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, relying on the masses, combining with production, and making unified arrangements. Under the premise of putting politics in command, scientific workers go deep into the front lines, go deep into reality, and boldly innovate, so that science and technology are well integrated with the mass movement.

The on-site visit to Xiangyin County gave many people a vivid and profound education. Xiangyin County is a swamp area spanning more than 180 li, with a large epidemic area and very complex epidemic factors. However, this year, thanks to the secretary taking the lead, the entire Party mobilizing, and the entire people taking action to carry out prevention work, more than 20,000 farmers producing in the epidemic area this year have basically avoided infection. They have many methods: on the one hand, they build roads and bridges, improve production tools and lifestyles, and minimize contact with epidemic water; on the other hand, they educate farmers in the epidemic area to wear leggings, cloth socks, and apply rosin alcohol and other protective agents to prevent cercariae from entering when they go to work. If there is no cloth, the masses tear down the god robes from the shrines; if drinking water is difficult, they use bamboo tubes to draw water from deep water to avoid contact with cercariae floating on the surface of the water. A new atmosphere of every boat having a manure tank, every village having a public toilet, and everyone paying attention to hygiene has emerged throughout the county. Those who visited were deeply moved. Many people realized that as long as we rely on the masses, there is nothing that cannot be done.

In the past, some medical experts, proceeding from a purely technical point of view, often demanded too high and too strict benefits from a certain protective agent and easily negated it, while ignoring the benefits of comprehensive protection. This time, during the on-site visit to Xiangyin County, their thinking was liberated. The rosin alcohol and other protective agents used by the farmers here are not 100% effective, but they use them comprehensively, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and achieve complementary total effects.

In the past, some medical experts stubbornly clung to the 20-day long-term treatment method, insisting that "promoting the three-day short-term treatment method would cause more deaths." This time, the experts and professors listened to a vivid report from medical worker Gu Ying in Xiangyin County. The satellite treatment team led by this 22-year-old girl treated 3,495 people in twelve days with four intermediate medical personnel, and each patient was safely discharged from the hospital. Xiangyin County universally promoted the three-day short-term treatment method during the busy farming season, treating more than 22,000 patients in the county in 23 days. The treatment efficiency was increased by 114 times compared to the original, and the mortality rate of antimony treatment was reduced to one in ten thousand.

The on-site visit swept away various conservative ideas and complacency, and everyone expressed their determination to strive to overfulfill this year's task of eliminating schistosomiasis with full enthusiasm and confidence.

### 血吸虫病防治工作势如破竹  目前必须加强防护工作，杜绝新的感染

    血吸虫病防治工作势如破竹
    目前必须加强防护工作，杜绝新的感染
    新华社长沙19日电　最近在湖南省湘阴县召开了全国血吸虫病防护工作现场会议。来自全国十二个省市的血吸虫病防治工作负责干部和专家、教授们，认真检查了过去的工作，总结和交流了防护工作经验和科学研究成果，并在统一思想认识的基础上订出了全国加强防护工作的建议方案。
    根据会议材料，今年春季全国血吸虫病防治工作有了一个大跃进。全国已有四十五个县市基本上消灭了钉螺，并结合灭螺积肥两亿多万担，增加耕地七十多万亩。全国今春治疗五十六万多病人，超过去年全年治疗的总人数。湖南省在开展以技术革新为中心的治疗高工效运动，做得更为出色。到5月底止，全省治疗十二万多病人，超过去年同期治疗总数的四倍半。湘阴县还推行了“六角钱、三斤米、三天治好一个病人”的多快好省的先进治疗方法，全县在5月份创造了平均每组（每组三、四个医务人员）治疗三千四百二十多名病人的全国高工效，而且保证了个个安全出院。目前，全国已有十五个县市基本上消灭了血吸虫病。事实有力地驳倒了各种悲观论调和保守思想，证明加速消灭血吸虫病是完全可能的。
    会议认为，在当前各地大量垦植湖洲、农民群众同疫水接触的机会一天天增多的新情况下，如何加强防护工作，杜绝新的感染，巩固治疗成果，加速消灭血吸虫病，就成为迫切的任务。据湖南、湖北等五省不完全统计，今春接触疫水生产的六十多万农民，由于加强了防护工作，就一般没有发现新的感染病人。各地防护工作的主要经验是：必须在各级党委的领导下，做到政治挂帅，依靠群众，结合生产，统一安排。在政治挂帅的前提下，科学工作者深入现场，深入实际，大胆革新，使科学技术与群众运动很好地结合起来。
    在湘阴县的现场参观，使许多人受到了生动深刻的教育。湘阴县是一个横跨一百八十多里的湖沼地带，疫区大，流行因素很复杂，可是，今年由于书记挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，开展防护工作，今年在疫区生产的两万多农民就基本上避免了感染。他们的办法很多：一方面修路、搭桥，改良生产工具和生活方式，尽量减少与疫水接触；一方面教育疫区农民出工时，人人打绑腿、穿布袜、搽松香酒精等防护剂，防止尾蚴侵入。没有布，群众从神龛上把神袍撕下来；饮用水困难，他们就用竹筒从深水处吸水，避免与浮在水面的尾蚴接触。全县已经出现了船船有粪缸、村村有公厕、人人讲卫生的新风气。参观的人都深为感动。许多人体会到，只要依靠了群众，就没有办不通的事。
    以前有些医学专家从单纯技术观点出发，往往对一种防护剂的效益要求过高过严，轻易否定，而忽视综合防护的效益。这次在湘阴县现场参观，他们的思想得到了解放。这里农民采用的松香酒精等防护剂，效益都不是百分之百的，但是他们综合运用，取长补短，就收到相辅相成的全效。
    以前还有些医学专家死啃着二十天的长程疗法，硬说“推行三日短程疗法会多死人”。这次，专家教授们在湘阴县听了医士谷应的一个生动报告。这位二十二岁的姑娘领导的卫星治疗组，四个中级医务人员在十二天内治疗了三千四百九十五人，个个安全出院。湘阴全县在农忙季节中，普遍推行三日短程疗法，在二十三天内治完全县二万二千多名病人，治疗工效比原来提高一百一十四倍，锑剂治疗死亡率下降到了万分之一。
    现场参观横扫了各种保守思想和松气自满情绪，大家都干劲十足、信心百倍地表示要力争超额完成今年消灭血吸虫病的任务。
