    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    74　Pomegranate Flower
    Thanks to Zhang Qian for bringing us from Central Asia,
    We didn't feel like outsiders when we came to China.
    The flowers are as red as fire, blooming in the hot summer,
    Responding to the working people, not competing.
    The sun smiles and says: Pomegranate comrades, hello!
    You possess the pride of the proletariat.
    Quickly bear ten thousand sweet pomegranate seeds,
    Fill them in golden urns and send them to factories and mines to reward the workers! (Note)
    (Note) "Golden urn" is a kind of wine vessel cast from bronze in ancient times. The fruit of the pomegranate is very similar to it, especially showing the antique charm of bronze.
    75　Phoenix Flower
    We are tall trees, originally named Poinciana, (Note)
    Planted on Phoenix Mountain in Macau, hence the name Phoenix Flower.
    The trunk and leaves are like silk trees but larger,
    The branches are full of flowers, blooming all year round, reaching towards the clouds.
    The corolla has five petals, red on the front and yellow on the back, gathered in a cluster,
    Forming long pod-like fruits, each exceeding one and a half feet.
    Opening freely in the morning breeze, the color does not fade after the flowers fall,
    Look, the sky and the ground are truly a scarlet一片!
    (Note) The original text is Poinciana. This flower is common in Myanmar, India, Ceylon, etc. It is a tall tree that blooms with red flowers, comparable to kapok.
    76　Silk Tree
    The poets of old were truly some muddleheads,
    Seeing the branches and leaves close in the evening, they associated it with Mimosa tree.
    They said seeing us can eliminate resentment,
    We ourselves feel indignant and unbearable!
    The so-called "silk tassel" is actually our stamen.
    The wood can be used to make utensils, and the bark is a worm repellent.
    We are deeply rooted and can maintain soil and water,
    We suggest: quickly cancel the name "Mimosa"!
    77　Sensitive Plant
    We look very much like the small fetus of the silk tree,
    Red velvet flowers and emerald green leaves, they have some similarities.
    If someone breathes on us or points a finger at us,
    Our branches and leaves will immediately wither and close.
    Therefore, people call us sensitive plant,
    What are we ashamed of? People should know.
    We are ashamed for those who move their mouths and hands,
    Please think about it: isn't it too rude?
    78　Poppy
    We are also called Afurong, which is Persian,
    Beautiful flowers, like enlarged tulips.
    Our arrival in China once caused the Opium War,
    This should be blamed on imperialism, but also on ourselves.
    We are originally medicinal herbs, with our own dosage,
    You eat us as three meals a day, how can you not die?
    Even rice, eating too much will ruin your stomach,
    Look at today, we have regained our reputation!
    79　Sunflower
    Of course, we are not as noble as peonies,
    But like Dieffenbachia, we bloom everywhere.
    Which common person doesn't know sunflowers?
    We face the sun and also face the farmers.
    Such large flowers are rare in plants,
    Like whales among animals, and producing oil in the same way.
    You must not despise our vegetable oil,
    Promoting industrialization is the only way to catch up with John Bull. (Note)
    (Note) "John Bull" in English is John Bull, a nickname for Britain.
    80　Lily
    "Lily surpasses the glory of Solomon" (Note 1),
    For two thousand years, we have liked this sentence;
    It's not to show that we are arrogant,
    What is the Jewish King Solomon after all?
    But we don't dare to boast in front of the common people,
    It is they who cultivate us and make us grow.
    We want to understand their dedication,
    Use flowers, stems, and bulbs to repay them. (Note 2)
    (Note 1) This is a passage from the "New Testament." See Matthew 6:28-29.
    (Note 2) The flowers and stems of lilies, ground into powder, have a hemostatic effect. The bulbs are rich in nutrients, can relieve phlegm, strengthen the stomach, and promote blood circulation. It is a tonic.
    81　Turk's Cap Lily
    We are a kind of wild small lily,
    The corolla is smaller, the flower stalk is shorter, and the bulb is not large.
    Growing in quiet mountain fields that do not face the sun,
    Among the lush green, red stars bloom, particularly outstanding.
    The people of northern Shaanxi say that we suffer in the gullies,
    Say that we competed with small garlic, and Turk's Cap Lily fell off the horse,
    Because we are not as resistant to drought as small garlic;
    This is a story made out of sympathy.
    82　Cotton Rose Hibiscus
    Bai Juyi once compared us to Yang Guifei, (Note)
    We may not be as beautiful as Yang Guifei.
    We hate that muddleheaded emperor the most,
    Wanting Yang Guifei to commit suicide, but not admitting his own guilt.
    How many unjust charges have been placed on women throughout history?
    Even today, we still feel a little injustice.
    Today is the people's liberation, and women are also liberated,
    Blooming before all things, we also feel equal.
    (Note) Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" sings about the story of Yang Yuhuan. There is a sentence that says: "Hibiscus like face, willow like eyebrows."

### 百花齐放

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    74　石榴花
    感谢张骞把我们从中亚带来，
    我们来到了中国并没有见外。
    花红如火在炎热的夏天盛开，
    是在响应劳动人民，不在比赛。
    太阳笑着说：石榴同志，你们好！
    你们具有着无产阶级的夸耀。
    赶快结出万粒清甜的石榴子，
    盛在金罍里送往厂矿去犒劳！（注）
    （注）“金罍”是古时用青铜铸造的一种盛酒的器皿。石榴的果实和它很相像，特别还表现着青铜器的古香古色。
    75　凤凰花
    我们是大乔木，原名本叫攀霞拿，（注）
    种在澳门凤凰山上故名凤凰花。
    干和叶都像马缨花而比他更大，
    花满枝头，周年开放，高攀着云霞。
    花冠五瓣，面红背黄，凑集在一团，
    结成长条蒴果每超过一尺有半。
    清晨迎风畅开，花落后色不雕残，
    你看，天上地下真个是绯红一片！
    （注）原文为Poinciana，此花在缅甸、印度、锡兰等地多见，乔木开红花，可与木棉相比。
    76　马缨花
    旧时的诗人真是一些胡涂蛋，
    见到枝叶晚合就联想到合欢。
    他们说看到我们就能够消忿，
    我们自己倒感觉到忿恨不堪！
    所谓“马缨”实际是我们的雄蕊。
    木材可以制器，皮是驱虫药料。
    我们植根甚深，可以保持水土，
    我们建议：快把“合欢”之名取消！
    77　害羞草
    我们很像是马缨花的小胎儿，
    红绒花、翠羽叶，都有一些相似。
    谁如向我们呼气或用手一指，
    我们的枝和叶便要立即萎闭。
    因此，人们便叫我们为害羞草，
    我们害什么羞？人们应该知道。
    我们是替动口动手的人害羞，
    请设身想想：岂不是太无礼貌？
    78　罂粟花
    我们又叫阿芙蓉，那是波斯话，
    美丽的花朵，好像郁金香放大。
    我们来中国曾引起鸦片战争，
    这要恨帝国主义，也要恨自家。
    我们本是药草，用量自有分剂，
    你们当成三顿饭吃，怎么不死？
    就是饭，吃多了也要弄坏肚皮，
    请看今日，我们已经恢复名誉！
    79　向日葵
    我们当然没有牡丹那样高华，
    但和死不了一样是到处开花。
    老百姓们谁个不知道向日葵？
    我们是向着太阳，也向着农家。
    这么大的花在植物中可少有，
    像动物中的鲸鱼，并同样出油。
    我们的植物油你可不要藐视，
    促进工业化，才好赶上约翰牛。（注）
    （注）“约翰牛”英文为John Bull，英国的绰号。
    80　百合花
    “百合花敌赛过所罗门的荣华”，（注一）
    两千年来我们就喜欢这句话；
    并不是要表示我们自高自大，
    犹太国王所罗门到底算得啥？
    但我们在老百姓面前不敢自夸，
    是他们把我们栽培，使我们长大。
    我们是要体会他们的献身精神，
    用花，用梗，用鳞茎来向他们报答。
                              （注二）
    （注一）这是“新约”里面的话。见马太福音第六章二十八节到二十九节。
    （注二）百合的花和梗研成粉末，有止血作用。鳞茎富于营养，能祛痰、健胃、促进血液循环，是一种强健剂。
    81　山丹花
    我们是野生的一种小百合花，
    花冠较小，花梗较短，鳞茎不大。
    生长在不向阳的幽静的山野，
    万绿丛中，红星朵朵，分外出色。
    陕北人说我们受苦在背洼洼，
    说和小蒜比赛，山丹丹落了马，
    因为不及小蒜能够抵抗旱魃；
    这是出于同情所编造出的话。
    82　木芙蓉
    白居易曾把我们来比杨贵妃，（注）
    我们或许没有杨贵妃那样美。
    我们最讨厌那位胡涂的皇帝，
    要让杨贵妃自杀，自己不认罪。
    古今来多少的冤罪加诸女性？
    一直到今天我们还有点不平。
    今天是人民解放，女性也解放，
    花开在万汇之前也感到平等。
    （注）白居易的“长恨歌”，所歌咏的即是杨玉环的故事。中有句云：“芙蓉如面柳如眉。”
