An Example of Bringing the Power of the Masses to Conquer Nature
Henan Basically Eliminates Common Flood and Drought Disasters

    (Our report) According to the Henan Daily, Henan Province, following the spirit of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and adhering to the water management policy of "emphasizing water storage, small-scale projects, and community management," has achieved unprecedented and great achievements in water conservancy construction through hard work throughout the winter and a great effort in the spring.

    Currently, 105 out of the province's 122 counties and cities have basically achieved water conservancy. The Henan Provincial Party Committee's requirement to basically achieve water conservancy by the end of May 1958 has been met ahead of schedule. As of May 8, a total of 8,004,415,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work had been completed, with a water storage capacity of 25.46 billion cubic meters for water conservancy projects. The irrigated area has been expanded by 74,710,000 mu, which together with the original 43,000,000 mu, brings the total irrigation capacity of water conservancy construction in the province to over 117,710,000 mu, accounting for 86.6% of the total cultivated area of the province. Among them, the gravity irrigation area reaches 46,750,000 mu.

    Due to such great achievements, most of the cultivated land in the province can eliminate common flood and drought disasters. Because the water storage capacity of large, medium, and small projects in the province has greatly increased, the 17 billion cubic meters of floodwater that may be generated by a single rainfall of 200 millimeters can be basically controlled in most areas. As a result, more than 30 million mu of cultivated land in low-lying and flood-prone areas have also been transformed, thus relieving the threat of ordinary floods. Most of the dry land in the province has been turned into irrigated land. Combined with efforts in fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, and other agricultural technologies, there is greater certainty of achieving "four, five, eight" ahead of schedule throughout the province. It also creates extremely favorable conditions for achieving the great goal of fundamentally changing the face of Henan through three years of hard work.

    This great achievement in water conservancy construction throughout the province is the result of the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts under the wise leadership of the Party, and is the result of the upsurge of communist ideology and the implementation of socialist large-scale cooperation. In the water conservancy construction movement, people not only made every effort to transform the natural environment of their own counties, townships, and communities, but also many people left their hometowns to support mountainous and waterlogged areas, as well as large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in hilly and plain areas with heavy tasks. More than 3 million people supporting other townships brought their own food, tools, tree species, seedlings, and materials lacking in mountainous or waterlogged areas, and more importantly, a sincere heart for building socialism in friendly neighboring areas. The people providing support put forward the heroic slogan: Plant socialist trees and bear communist fruits.

    This water conservancy movement also fully proves that the "three emphases" water management policy of "emphasizing water storage, small-scale projects, and community management" is the concrete realization of the general line of going full steam ahead, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and economical results in water conservancy construction. In the nine years since liberation, Henan Province once had a guiding ideology that emphasized drainage, large-scale projects, and state-run projects in water conservancy construction. Therefore, in more than eight years, the state invested more than 500 million yuan and mobilized tens of thousands of people every year to carry out water conservancy construction, completing only 360 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. However, last winter and this spring, due to the thorough reversal of this erroneous guiding ideology and the implementation of the "three emphases" water management policy, the state invested only 30 million yuan in a short period of half a year, and the number of people involved in water conservancy construction every day was more than 10 million, completing 8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work.

    In the great struggle to march towards nature, the vast number of cadres and people in Henan demonstrated the communist style of daring to think, daring to act, daring to create, and daring to do, as well as the communist revolutionary spirit of enduring hardship, overcoming difficulties, and braving dangers. In the management of any mountain, river, depression, or plain, the Party committee and the government always relied on the masses and led a group of people who dared to imagine conquering nature, making magnificent and ambitious plans, and mobilizing and relying on the vast number of the masses, braving wind and snow, defying severe cold, and fearing no difficulties, marching towards towering mountains, deep gullies and barren mountains, plains and depressions, and sandy and alkaline wastelands, singing aloud and advancing rapidly, like a hot knife through butter. People carved stones in the air, drilled holes and dug soil, opened sluices to divert water, built dams to irrigate fields, built reservoirs by splitting mountains, and opened land to build ponds, diverting river water, rainwater, and spring water to land that had never been irrigated before.

    In order to fundamentally control water and drought disasters and completely ensure that there is no disaster in heavy rain and a bumper harvest in the absence of rain, Henan Province is currently strengthening the management and maintenance of completed projects in areas that have basically achieved water conservancy, or is preparing to do so, to ensure quality, ensure safety, and fully realize benefits, overcome water and drought disasters, and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture. Areas that have not yet achieved water conservancy are strengthening leadership and taking effective measures to catch up quickly.

    While leading the people to achieve great achievements in water conservancy construction, the Party and government leaders of this province also pointed out that eliminating ordinary water and drought disasters is not the end of water conservancy construction, but only the great beginning of the water conservancy construction movement. From now on, the province's water conservancy has entered a new stage, that is, on the basis of thoroughly implementing the "three emphases" policy, taking small-scale projects as the foundation, medium-sized projects as the backbone, and combining large, medium, and small projects, moving towards the goal of fundamentally controlling various river, water, and drought disasters. That is, we must find ways to "eat" the floods of every river and make full use of every drop of rainwater that falls on the land. At the same time, we must not only consider water conservancy construction from the perspective of developing agricultural production, but also strive to make comprehensive use of water resources from all aspects such as shipping, power generation, flood control, and irrigation. That is, we must strive to achieve irrigation automation, hydropower electrification, and build a water conservancy network with interconnected rivers and canals.

    发挥群众威力征服大自然的范例
    河南基本消除一般水旱灾害
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：河南省遵循了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线精神，按照“以蓄为主、小型为主、社办为主”的治水方针，苦战一冬，大干一春，取得了水利建设的空前的伟大的成就。
    现在，全省一百二十二个县、市已有一百零五个县、市基本实现了水利化。河南省委提出在1958年5月底以前基本实现水利化的要求，已经提前达到了。截至5月8日统计，总计共完成土、石方八十亿零四千四百一十五万公方，已做水利工程的蓄水能力达到二百五十四亿六千万公方，扩大灌溉面积七千四百七十一万亩，连原有四千三百万亩，全省水利建设灌溉能力共可达到一亿一千七百多万亩，占全省总耕地面积的86.6％，其中自流灌溉面积达到四千六百七十五万亩。
    由于取得了这样伟大的成就，全省大部分耕地可以消除一般水旱灾害。因为全省大、中、小型工程的蓄水能力大大增加，一次降雨二百公厘时，全省所可能产生的一百七十亿公方洪水在大部分地区可以得到基本控制。从而使低洼易涝地区的三千多万亩耕地，也得到了改造，因此可以解除普通涝灾的威胁。全省大部分旱地变为水地，结合积肥，改良土壤及其他农业技术上的努力，在全省范围内提前实现“四、五、八”就有了更大的把握。也为实现苦战三年，从根本上改变河南面貌的伟大奋斗目标创造了极为有利的条件。
    全省水利建设的这个巨大成就，是由于全省人民在党的英明领导下，在政治战线和思想战线上取得社会主义革命胜利的结果，是共产主义思想高涨和推行社会主义大协作的结果。在水利建设运动中，人们不但竭尽全力努力改造本县、本乡和本社的自然面貌，而且许多人离开家乡，支援山区和涝区，以及支援任务繁重的丘陵、平原上的大、中型水利工程。支援外乡的三百多万人自带粮食、工具、树种、树苗以及山区或涝区人民所缺的物资，更重要的是带给友邻地区一颗建设社会主义的热诚的心。支援的人们提出豪迈的口号说：种上社会主义树，结出共产主义果。
    这次水利化运动，还充分证明“以蓄为主、小型为主、社办为主”的“三主”治水方针，是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线在水利建设上的具体实现。解放九年来，河南省在水利建设上曾经发生过以排水为主、以大型工程为主、以国家兴办为主的指导思想，所以在八年多的时间内，国家投资五亿多元，每年动员数十万人去进行水利建设，只完成土、石方三亿六千万公方；但在去冬今春，由于彻底扭转了这种错误的指导思想，贯彻执行了“三主”治水方针，在短短的半年时间内，国家仅投资三千万元，每天投入水利建设的人数是一千多万人，完成了土、石方八十亿公方。
    在向自然进军的伟大斗争中，河南广大干部和群众表现了敢想、敢干、敢作、敢为的共产主义风格和忍苦耐劳、克服艰险的共产主义革命精神。在治理任何一个山头、一条河流、一片洼地或一块平原时，无不是先由党委和政府依靠群众，带领着一批气吞山河的敢于设想征服自然的人们，作出气势雄伟、理想远大的规划，而且动员和依靠广大群众，不避风雪，不畏严寒，不怕各种困难，向崇山峻岭、向深沟荒山、向平原洼地、向沙碱荒滩进军，高歌猛进，势如破竹。人们悬空刻石，钻洞挖土，开闸引水，堵坝灌田，劈山作水库，开地修水塘，将河水、雨水、泉水引向从来没有进行过灌溉的土地上。
    为了根治水旱灾害，彻底作到大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收，河南省目前在已经基本上实现了水利化的地区，已经或正准备加强对已完工程的管理养护工作，以确保质量，确保安全，充分发挥效益，战胜水、旱灾害，保证农业大丰收。而尚未实现水利化的地区正在加强领导，采取有效措施急起直追。
    这个省的党政领导上，在领导人民取得水利建设的巨大成就的同时，还指出，消灭普通水、旱灾不是进行水利建设的终结，而只是水利建设运动的伟大的开端。今后全省的水利又进入了一个新的阶段，就是在彻底实现“三主”方针的基础上，以小型为基础，以中型为骨干，大、中、小型工程相结合，向根治各河流、水、旱灾害的目标前进。即是要把每条河流的洪水都设法“吃”掉，让落在土地上的每一滴雨水，都要得到充分利用。同时，不仅仅要求从发展农业生产上考虑水利建设，而且要在航运、发电、防洪、灌溉等各方面出发，努力做好水利资源的综合利用。即要努力达到灌溉自流化，水力电气化，修成河渠相通的水利网。
