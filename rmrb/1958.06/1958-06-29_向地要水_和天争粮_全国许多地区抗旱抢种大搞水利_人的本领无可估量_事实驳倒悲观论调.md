Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch: Currently, severe drought threatens the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River basin, the Huai River basin, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin, and parts of Northeast China. To strive for a comprehensive autumn harvest, farmers in these areas are launching a massive anti-drought campaign to draw water from the earth and compete for grain with the heavens with high morale.

Anti-drought planting and seedling protection have become the central tasks of current rural work in the aforementioned provinces. Hebei Province is fighting the current drought with the successful experience of spring drought resistance. In Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other regions with severe drought, more than two million people are developing water sources and fetching water to irrigate fields day and night. In Shandong Province, a labor army of 15 million people is participating in anti-drought planting and seedling protection activities every day. By mid-month, more than 12 million mu of drought-resistant crops such as corn and millet have been sown. Henan Province mobilizes 15 million laborers every day to attack the drought at a rate of 2 million mu of sowing per day. Now the province has sown more than 50 million mu of summer crops, accounting for more than 64% of the summer planting task. In Anhui Province, 8 to 9 million farmers are also fighting the drought every day. Many agricultural cooperatives also set up camps in the fields and worked hard day and night in shifts. So far, the drought-resistant sowing area in this province has reached more than 40 million mu, and drought-resistant seedling protection has reached 7.5 million mu. They said, "Even if it doesn't rain for a year, we must strive for a bumper harvest." Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hubei and Jiangsu provinces have also launched anti-drought campaigns. In the fight against drought, all localities have tried their best to use surface water and groundwater. Jiangsu Province relies on the masses to dig new wells, renovate old wells, and find springs, and has discovered a large amount of groundwater resources. Shuyang County, on the Xu-Huai Plain, which suffers from severe drought, after a great debate, refuted the pessimistic views spread by some people that the plains lack water and drilling wells cannot solve the drought resistance problem. The county's 350,000-strong army fought for five days and dug 40,000 wells, enabling the county's 240,000 mu of corn, soybeans, and cotton to be irrigated with water. Many areas in Hubei are building dams to divert water for irrigation. In the recent dozens of days of drought resistance, farmers in Taian County, Shandong Province, have expanded the irrigation area by more than 100,000 mu and completed more than 70% of the summer sowing task by digging mountain springs, digging ponds, deepening old wells, and drilling machine wells. Farmers in Anhui Province have found a large amount of groundwater resources by deepening ditches and ponds, and digging wells and finding springs at the bottom of the ponds and ditches.

During the fight against drought, the large number of water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring have generated huge benefits. In Gushi County, Henan Province, there has been no rain for a long time, but the "Hundred Li Doesn't Rely on Heaven" project built last winter and this spring—the Liberation and Leap Forward Irrigation Canals—now have clear water flowing directly in the canals, which not only enables more than 360,000 mu of rice to be planted in a timely manner, but also provides sufficient water for more than 150,000 mu of dry land. More than 300 agricultural cooperatives in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, that have realized water networking, guarantee the water for expanding rice transplanting tenfold. Changmei Township, Huaiyuan County, in this province, has realized water networking, and the township has stored 1.2 billion cubic meters of water. In addition to using 700 million cubic meters of water for drought-resistant planting, there is also a surplus of 500 million cubic meters of water.

The bad thing about drought is being transformed into a good thing by the heroic people of Hebei and Henan in accordance with dialectical viewpoints. This is to combine drought resistance with a large-scale water conservancy movement to train people's ability to fight against nature. In more than 20 days, Hebei added more than 90,000 machine wells and brick wells, and the irrigation area increased from more than 80 million mu to more than 90 million mu. In the fight against drought, only four regions in Henan, including Xinyang and Xuchang, have built more than 9,000 river dams and dug mountain springs, opened more than 2,000 new canals, and drilled and repaired more than 60,000 new and old wells. The development of the water conservancy movement has accelerated the progress of summer sowing in these two provinces.

In order to overcome the drought, party and government leading organs in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei and other provinces have recently held various meetings or issued emergency notices to deploy the current drought-resistant planting and seedling protection. Hebei and Shandong also sent inspection teams to areas with severe drought to help with the work. At the same time, during this period, all localities fully promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. In terms of water use, parochialism has been transformed into mutual aid and collectivism, and water grabbing has been transformed into planned and coordinated water use, so that water can be used rationally.

    向地要水　和天争粮
    全国许多地区抗旱抢种大搞水利
    人的本领无可估量  事实驳倒悲观论调
    新华社28日讯　目前干旱严重地威胁着黄河流域中下游、淮河流域、长江流域中下游和东北一部分地区。这些地区的农民为力争秋季全面丰收，正以昂扬的意志开展一个规模巨大的向地要水、和天争粮的抗旱斗争。
    抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗已经成为上述各省当前农村工作的中心任务。河北省正以春季抗旱成功的经验，和当前的旱象斗争。旱象较重的天津、保定、石家庄等专区，二百多万人正在不分昼夜地开发水源，取水浇田。山东省目前每天有一千五百万人的劳动大军参加抗旱抢种、保苗的活动，到本月中旬止，抗旱播种的玉米、谷子等作物已达一千二百多万亩。河南省每天出动一千五百万劳力，以一天播种二百万亩的速度，向干旱进攻，现在全省已播种夏播作物五千多万亩，占夏种任务的64％多。安徽省每天也有八、九百万农民在抗旱。许多农业社还在田野里安营扎寨，夜以继日地轮番苦战，到目前，这个省抗旱播种面积已达四千多万亩，抗旱保苗七百五十万亩。他们说，“就是一年不下雨，也要争取丰收”。黑龙江省、内蒙古自治区、湖北和江苏等省也开展了抗旱斗争。在抗旱斗争中，各地都千方百计地利用地上水和地下水。江苏省依靠群众打新井、整理旧井、找泉眼，发掘了大量的地下水源。干旱较重的徐淮平原上的沭阳县，经过大辩论驳倒了某些人散布的平原缺水打井不能解决抗旱的悲观论调，全县三十五万大军奋战五天打了四万眼井，使全县已种的二十四万亩玉米、大豆、棉花有了水灌溉。湖北许多地区正拦河筑坝，引水灌田。山东省泰安县农民在最近几十天的抗旱中，用挖山泉、挖水池、深淘旧井、打机井等办法，扩大灌溉面积十万多亩，完成了夏播任务70％以上。安徽省农民用加深沟塘，在塘底沟底打井下泉、找泉眼等办法寻找出大量的地下水源。
    在抗旱斗争中，去冬今春兴修的大量水利工程发生了巨大的效益。河南省固始县久旱无雨，但去冬今春修成的“百里不靠天”工程——解放和跃进灌溉渠，现在渠道里清水直流，不仅使三十六万多亩水稻适时种上，而且使十五万多亩旱地也有了充足的水源。安徽省阜阳专区的三百多个实现了水网化的农业社，保证了扩大十倍的水稻栽秧用水。这个省的怀远县常坆乡，实现了水网化，全乡蓄水十二亿公方，除抗旱抢种用水七亿公方外，还余水五亿公方。
    干旱这种坏事，正被英雄的河北、河南人民按照辩证观点转化为好事。这就是结合抗旱大搞水利运动，锻炼人们同自然斗争的本领。河北在二十多天中，机井、砖井增加了九万多眼，灌溉面积从八千多万亩增加到九千多万亩。河南仅信阳、许昌等四个专区，在抗旱中即修拦河坝和挖山泉各九千多处，开新渠二千多条，打新井、修旧井六万多眼。水利运动的发展，加快了这两省的夏季播种进度。
    为了战胜干旱，河北、河南、山东、湖北等省党政领导机关最近都召开了各种会议或者发出了紧急通知，对当前的抗旱抢种、抗旱保苗做了部署。河北、山东还派出检查组到旱象较重的地区帮助工作。同时，这一时期，各地充分发扬了共产主义协作精神。在用水方面，本位主义变成互助的集体主义，抢水争浇变为有计划地协作用水，这样使水得到合理使用。
