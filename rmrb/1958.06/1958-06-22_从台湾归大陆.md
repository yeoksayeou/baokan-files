    One Sunday in early June, I met Cui Cheng Lin and Yu Guo Fan, former naval personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek army who had just returned from Taiwan, in Beihai Park. They were enjoying the scenery, watching the boats gliding on the water and the happy singing of the people. Overwhelmed with emotion, they poured out their hearts to me, recounting the heinous crimes of the US military in Taiwan and the tragic experiences of the Taiwanese people. They said: In Taiwan, it is truly another world! Many scenic parks have been occupied by the US military and have become criminal places for trampling on and humiliating our Taiwanese compatriots.

    Cui Cheng Lin was originally the lieutenant and ship maintenance group leader of the Chiang Kai-shek army's Zhongxing warship, and Yu Guo Fan was originally a first-class petty officer third class on the Zhongxing warship. They are both around thirty years old and have spent most of the last decade living in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. There, they witnessed many crimes committed by the US military. They said that in Kaohsiung Port, there are often five or six US warships and more than a thousand US sailors. Piers number one, three, and four in Kaohsiung are specifically designated for use by the US Navy and merchant ships, and Taiwanese ships and Chiang Kai-shek's warships are not allowed to enter. Near the Love River opposite the Kaohsiung "Yuanshan Hotel," more than 2,000 houses have recently been demolished and hundreds of acres of land seized to build a park for Americans to enjoy themselves, forcing residents to have nowhere to live. The Qixian Road and Xizi Bay areas, where the US military is concentrated, are even more chaotic and traffic is impossible to maintain. Groups of US sailors, like mad dogs, ride unicycles and rush around everywhere, setting off firecrackers and throwing them at pedestrians for fun. The US military's "Water Recreation Center" in Kaohsiung Port has become a hellhole for Taiwanese women. US soldiers often abduct Taiwanese women to this place at night to humiliate them, sometimes forcing women to take off their clothes and dance the "swing dance" or kneel in front of them and sing American pop songs.

    Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers are also under the yoke of the US military, enduring hardship and humiliation. Yu Guo Fan and Cui Cheng Lin indignantly recounted such an event: When the Chiang Kai-shek army's Emei warship was undergoing major repairs, a US sergeant with the title of "advisor" came. As soon as he arrived, he acted aggressively, forcing the ship repair technicians to listen to his orders, and even the use of a screw had to be approved by him. Some people ignored him, so he showed off his power, pointing at the major engineer's nose to scold and berate him, and submitted a "memorandum," forcing the Chiang Kai-shek authorities to give the major engineer a dismissal punishment.

    "There are too many things like this!" They said, "Now Chiang Kai-shek's army has been completely grabbed by the Americans." Recently, the United States has been playing the trick of "re-equipping" in Taiwan, ordering Chiang Kai-shek's army to re-inventory and register all weapons and equipment previously aided by the United States, submit the bills to the US Department of Defense, and then refit them according to the US plan. Before that, the US military authorities also ordered the closure of Chiang Kai-shek's largest "60" arsenal. At the same time, a Chiang Kai-shek army naval machinery school (a school for training senior shipbuilding personnel) in Zuoying, Taiwan, was also dissolved under US pressure. These events have caused a great shock in Chiang Kai-shek's army, and many people say that in the past, the claws of the United States were strangling our arms and legs, but now they have developed to strangling our necks.

    Yu Guo Fan said: One day, he personally saw a group of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers stationed in Zuoying bathing at Taoziyuan Beach. A soldier unintentionally swam to the US warship, but the US soldiers tied him up and beat him half to death. Several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers stepped forward to reason with them, but the US military said: "This is a US military zone, and you are not allowed to illegally enter." Now, the Taoziyuan Beach has been completely occupied by the US military.

    The residents of Kaohsiung all know about this incident: Guo Yuejin, the wife of the air force base supply lieutenant of the Kuomintang in Tainan, was spotted by an American soldier at a dance party and was pestered by him everywhere. In June of last year, the American soldier forcibly dragged Guo Yuejin to a hotel to open a room, but she managed to escape. However, the American soldier followed her home, beat her all over her body, knocked her unconscious on the ground, and smashed her home furnishings to pieces. The most luxurious Chiang Kai-shek military dependents' residence in Kaohsiung, the "Triumphant Return" Building, is now also occupied by the US military and converted into a US military "soldiers' club."

    Cui Cheng Lin and Yu Guo Fan said: How can anyone with a little national consciousness not feel a kind of irrepressible resentment and the pain of being at the mercy of others when faced with the various acts of tyranny of the American soldiers in Taiwan! The majority of people therefore harbor rebellious emotions, and they explode as soon as they are stimulated. In addition, many people feel that life has no hope, and they become depressed, decadent, and even commit suicide.

    They said that in the scenic spots and streets of Taiwan, they often see words like "Alas! Cherish life," "Think a step back," and so on, to persuade people not to commit suicide. However, the trend of suicide is still very prevalent. Often some Chiang Kai-shek personnel first kill their families or their superiors, and then shoot themselves. One colonel ran to Chiang Kai-shek's "Presidential Palace" and jumped to his death. At that time, they thought: After messing around in Taiwan for so many years, away from home and family, who is it all for? How can we jump out of this sea of ​​misery? When will this "wanderer's" life end? After thinking about it, there is only one bright road, which is to wait for the opportunity and rush to the mainland. When they followed the Zhongxing ship to Yokohama, Japan, to receive torpedo boats, they finally managed to escape from the warship and return to the motherland via Hong Kong.

    从台湾归大陆
    新华社记者  丁固
    6月上旬的一个星期天，记者在北海公园会见了刚从台湾归来的蒋军海军人员崔成霖和于国藩。他们正在尽情地游览，看着轻舟荡波、幸福欢唱的人民，对此情景不禁感慨万端，向记者倾诉了美军在台湾的滔天罪行和台湾人民的凄惨遭遇。他们说：在台湾，真是另一个天地啊！许多风景幽美的公园都被美军霸占着，成为蹂躏和侮辱我们台湾同胞的罪恶场所。
    崔成霖原是蒋军海军中兴号军舰上尉舰勤组长，于国藩原是中兴号军舰三等一级士官长。他们都是三十岁上下的人，近十年来，大部分时间住在台湾高雄。在那里，他们亲眼看到了美军的许多罪行。他们说，在高雄港口，经常有五、六艘美国兵舰和一千多名美国水兵。高雄一、三、四号码头专门划给美国海军和商船使用，台湾的船只和蒋军的舰艇不能进入。高雄“园山饭店”对面的爱河旁边，近来为修建一座供美国人玩乐的公园，就拆毁了两千多户民房，强占了几百亩土地，逼得居民无处栖身。在美军云集的七贤路、西子湾一带，更是乌烟瘴气，交通也无法维持。一群群像疯狗似的美国水兵骑着独轮脚踏车到处乱闯，燃着鞭炮，向行人身上乱摔取乐。高雄港口的美军“水上招待所”成了台湾妇女的火坑。美军常常在黑夜里把台湾妇女捉到这里污辱，有时还强迫妇女脱光衣服，跳“摇摆舞”，或者跪在他们面前，唱美国流行曲。
    蒋军官兵也同样处在美军的奴役下，忍苦忍辱，于国藩和崔成霖愤慨地叙述了这样一件事：蒋军峨嵋号军舰大修时，来了一个挂着“顾问”招牌的美军上士。他一到就张牙舞爪，强迫修舰的技术人员听他摆布，动用一个螺丝都要经他批准。有些人没理他，他就大耍威风，指着少校轮机长的鼻子斥责谩骂；并且提出“备忘录”，逼着蒋军当局给这位少校轮机长撤职处分。
    “这样的事情太多了！”他们说：“现在蒋军已经被美国人一把抓在手里。”最近美国又在台湾搞“再装备”的把戏，命令蒋军把过去美国援助的一切武器装备重新清点、登记，把账单送交美国国防部，然后按照美国的方案重新改装。在这以前，美国军事当局还勒令关闭了蒋军最大的“六零”兵工厂。同时，台湾左营的一所蒋军海军机械学校（训练高级造船人材的学校），也在美国的要挟下解散了。这些事件，在蒋军部队中引起了很大震动，许多人说，过去美国的魔爪是扼着我们的胳膊、大腿，现在发展到紧扼着我们的脖子了。
    于国藩说：有一天，他亲眼看到驻在左营的一批蒋军水兵在桃子园海边洗澡，有个水兵无意中游到美国兵舰那里，美国水兵却把他捆绑起来，打得死去活来。当场有几个蒋军水兵上前讲理，美军竟然说：“这是美军要港，不准你们偷渡入境。”现在桃子园海滨浴场已经完全被美军霸占了。
    高雄的居民都知道这件事：台南国民党空军基地军需上尉的妻子郭越津，在一次舞会上被一个美国兵看上了，以后就到处被他纠缠着。去年6月间，这个美国兵强拉郭越津到旅馆去开房间，她设法逃回了。但是这个美国兵尾追到她家里，把她打得遍体鳞伤，昏倒在地，又把她家里的用具打得稀烂。高雄最华丽的蒋军军眷住宅“凯旋归”大厦，现在也被美军霸占着，改为美军“士兵俱乐部”。
    崔成霖和于国藩说：美国兵在台湾的种种横行霸道，稍有民族意识的人，怎能不感到有一种难以压抑的愤恨和随人俯仰的痛苦！大多数人因此蕴藏着反抗的情绪，稍受一点刺激便轰然爆炸起来。另外也有许多人觉得生活没有希望，而消沉、颓废，甚至走上自杀的末路。
    他们说，在台湾的风景区和街头巷尾，他们常常看到“唉！爱惜生命”、“退一步想”等等劝人不要自杀的字样。但是自杀的风气还是很盛。常常有些蒋军人员，先打死家小，或者打死上司，然后开枪自杀。有一个上校军官，跑到蒋介石的“总统府”跳楼自杀了。当时他们想：在台湾鬼混了这么多年，远离家乡和亲人，究竟是为了谁？怎么才能跳出苦海？何时何日才能结束这“游子”生涯？想来想去只有一条光明之路，就是等待时机，奔向大陆。他们在随中兴舰到日本横滨接收鱼雷艇的时候，终于设法逃离军舰，经香港回到了祖国大陆。
