　　Cultivating Children's Communist Spirit
    We are in an era of great leap forward. The people of the whole country are riding the wind and waves, advancing rapidly on the road of socialist construction.

    The new situation unfolds infinitely bright prospects before the new generation, and the new situation promotes the people of the whole country to pay closer attention to the growth of children and teenagers.

    Our country has 120 million children and teenagers. They will be the main force in completing our country's transition from socialism to communism. Many of them will soon participate in our country's socialist construction, so they should be cultivated to become socialist-conscious and cultured laborers, and cultivated to become people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to break superstitions, dare to innovate and create, dare to uphold the truth, charge forward for the truth, and establish advanced banners. For this great purpose, we must carry out communist education for children and teenagers.

    In the cause of cultivating and educating the new generation, there are currently two guiding ideologies and two educational methods. One is to ignore the ideological and political education of children, limit learning to book knowledge, and limit education to the classroom, thus making children divorced from social and political life and divorced from the struggle for production, just like cultivating children in a "greenhouse." People under this kind of ideological guidance seem to "cherish" children, but in fact they despise and distrust children, and everything is arranged for children by adults, so that children can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. This kind of thinking and practice is the practice of cultivating young masters and misses, and cannot cultivate children into true communists. The other is to not only pay attention to the education of cultural and scientific knowledge, but also closely link children's education with the political life, revolutionary struggle, and production struggle of the whole people; not only to strive to do a good job in classroom education, but also to enthusiastically care for and carry out the activities of the Young Pioneers, fully trust children, and value and cultivate children's independent ability. This is in line with the Marxist-Leninist educational principles, and can train children to become true communists. All work to educate children should implement the latter approach. This should be the case for schools, the Young Pioneers, kindergartens, and parents.

    How to cultivate the communist spirit of children and teenagers? We must oppose the idea of ​​treating reading as the only way to cultivate children. It is the worst kind of learning to only value book knowledge and be divorced from reality. Lenin said: "Without work, without struggle, then obtaining book knowledge of communism from communist pamphlets and writings can be said to be worthless." Of course, this is not to say that learning book knowledge is unimportant at all; book knowledge is also important. The Party advocates the large-scale establishment of schools precisely to allow more people to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. Without culture, the speed of construction cannot be accelerated. What we oppose is not books, but the idea of ​​separating books from practice and reading behind closed doors. It should be said that reading is learning, working is learning, labor is learning, participating in social and political life is learning, and conducting Young Pioneer activities is also learning. The meaning of learning should be broad. The "Little Five-Year Plan" activities carried out among children and teenagers in 1955, and the three activities of afforestation, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, and speaking Mandarin initiated by the Young Pioneers in various places this year, are the most vivid communist education and the excellent tradition of my country's revolutionary children's movement. The communist spirit of children cannot be cultivated in a static life. It must be closely combined with the political life of the whole people, and children should be attracted to participate in the struggle for socialist construction with content and methods suitable for the age characteristics of children and teenagers, so that children can care about politics from an early age, love socialism, and be tempered in socialist political life. We must closely combine with the production struggle of the whole people, let children participate in labor within their capacity, so that children can learn production knowledge, love labor, and develop industrious habits in labor. We must also regularly conduct revolutionary traditional education for children and teenagers, so that children know the painful life of workers and peasants in the old society; know the arduous struggles that revolutionaries have waged to establish a new society, so that they can love socialism more and are determined to inherit the fine traditions of revolutionary predecessors (including the fine traditions of the Young Pioneers and children's corps during the revolutionary period). The education of fine revolutionary traditions should be more systematic and richer in the future, so that it can penetrate the hearts of children and teenagers.

    Schools have a major mission to cultivate children. School education must overcome the shortcomings of being divorced from the reality of socialist construction and running schools behind closed doors. In schools, children's study life should be combined with social political life and production struggle, and the role of the Young Pioneers should be fully utilized to carry out the communist children's movement. In order to better play the role of the Young Pioneers, the current ideological obstacle to be overcome is the "outdated movement theory." Those who hold the "outdated movement theory" believe that during the construction period, the Young Pioneers should no longer engage in any movement, but should "behave properly" and help children learn classroom knowledge well. They ignore the characteristics of the Young Pioneers, and reject various rich and lively activities that are not directly related to the classroom but have significant educational significance. They treat the new things of socialism with outdated educational views. They do not understand that the relationship between the Young Pioneers and the school is complementary. They have common points, that is, their educational goals are consistent; but they also have different points, that is, the school mainly educates children through lectures, and the Young Pioneers mainly educates children through their own practice. The Young Pioneers are an organization for self-education of children and teenagers, not an affiliated organization of the school; therefore, the Young Pioneers should never be "schoolized." We must actively help the Young Pioneers to participate in the public production labor of socialist construction and do things they love that are meaningful and suitable for the characteristics of children and teenagers. Let the Young Pioneers run the team and carry out activities on their own. In this way, the Young Pioneers will be lively and energetic, and more effectively cultivate children's communist spirit.

    There are also some people who look down on children, and they think that children can't do anything. In fact, children are "small in stature but have great ambitions," and young minds often create miracles. In the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, children are also ambitious and have high revolutionary aspirations. Some children have already made inventions and creations. For example, Zhang Gouduo, who is twelve years old, created a single-wheel double-cylinder waterwheel, which surpassed the locally renowned "Liberation-style waterwheel," and the masses called him "Little Zhuge." In Shizhuang No. 1 Cooperative, Honey Township, Renshou County, Sichuan Province, the cotton grown by eight children and teenagers actually surpassed the cotton yield of the local masses' cotton fields. The average cotton field in the local area produces only forty catties of lint per mu, while their cotton field produces one hundred and thirty-five catties per mu. They also strive to produce three hundred and fifty catties of lint per mu. Students from Jiaokou Elementary School in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, boldly innovated and came up with ways to make wheat grow six or seven ears. When the local masses saw the wheat they planted, they exclaimed, "This is simply growing into sorghum!"

    This year's "June 1st" Children's Day is right after the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. The general line of socialist construction formulated by our Party is a lighthouse that illuminates all work. We should insert the red flag of the general line into the field of children's education, break the ideas of the bourgeoisie, establish the ideas of the proletariat, closely combine children's education with the great practice of socialist construction, let children be educated in various practices, and cultivate children into a cultured and labor-loving reserve force for building communism.

### 培养儿童的共产主义精神

　　培养儿童的共产主义精神
    我们正处于伟大的飞跃发展的时代。全国人民都在乘风破浪、势如破竹地在社会主义建设的大道上兼程迈进。
    新的形势，在新一代面前，展开了无限光明的前景，新的形势推动全国人民，更密切地关心少年儿童的成长。
    我国有一亿二千万少年儿童。他们将是完成我国由社会主义向共产主义过渡的主力。其中有许多人，即将参加我国的社会主义建设，因此，应该培养他们成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者，培养他们成为敢想、敢说、敢做、敢于破除迷信、敢于革新创造、敢于坚持真理、为真理冲锋陷阵、树立先进旗帜的人。为了这个伟大的目的，我们必须对少年儿童进行共产主义的教育。
    在培养与教育新一代的事业中，目前存在着两种指导思想和两种教育方法。一种是忽视儿童的思想政治教育，把学习局限在书本知识上，把教育局限在课堂上，因此使儿童脱离社会政治生活，脱离生产斗争，犹如在“温室中培植花草”一样地培育儿童。在这种思想指导下的人们，看来是“爱护”儿童，实际上对儿童是轻视的、不信任的，一切都由成人为儿童安排好，使儿童坐享其成。这种思想和做法，是培养少爷、小姐的做法，是不能把儿童培养成真正的共产主义者的。另一种是不仅注意文化科学知识的教育，而且把儿童教育同全民的政治生活、革命斗争和生产斗争密切地联系起来，不仅努力搞好课堂教育，而且热情地关怀和开展少先队的活动，充分相信儿童，重视和培养儿童的独立能力。这样才合乎马克思列宁主义的教育原则，才能把儿童锻炼成为真正的共产主义者。一切教育儿童的工作，都应该贯彻后一种做法。学校如此，少先队如此，幼儿园如此，做父母的也都应该如此。
    怎样培养少年儿童的共产主义精神呢？我们要反对那种把读书当作培养儿童的唯一办法的思想。只重视书本知识而脱离实际，这是最坏的学习。列宁说过：“没有工作，没有斗争，那末单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得书本上的共产主义知识，可以说一文钱不值。”当然，这丝毫也不是说学习书本知识无关紧要，书本知识也是重要的。党提倡大量兴办学校，正是为了让更多的人去学习文化科学知识，在缺少文化的状况下，是不能加快建设速度的。我们反对的不是书本，而是书本与实践隔离，关门读书的思想。应该说读书是学习，工作是学习，劳动是学习，参加社会政治生活是学习，进行少先队活动也是学习。学习的涵义应该是广泛的。1955年在少年儿童中所开展的“小五年计划”的活动，今年各地少先队所发起的植树造林、除四害讲卫生、讲普通话的三项活动等，就是最生动的共产主义教育，也是我国革命的儿童运动的优良传统。儿童的共产主义精神是不可能在静止的生活中培养出来的，必需密切地结合全民的政治生活，用适合少年儿童年龄特点的内容和方法，去吸引儿童参加社会主义建设的斗争，使儿童从小就关心政治，热爱社会主义，在社会主义的政治生活中受到陶冶。我们必须密切地结合全民的生产斗争，让儿童参加力所胜任的劳动，使儿童在劳动中学到生产知识，热爱劳动和养成勤劳的习惯。我们还要向少年儿童经常地进行革命传统教育，使儿童知道旧社会工农的痛苦生活；知道革命者为了建立新社会所曾经进行的艰苦斗争，从而更加热爱社会主义，并且决心继承革命前辈的优良传统（包括革命时期少先队儿童团的优良传统）。革命优良传统的教育，今后应该更有系统更丰富一些，使它深入少年儿童的心灵。
    学校对儿童的培养负有重大使命。学校教育要克服脱离社会主义建设实际、关门办学的缺点。在学校中要把儿童的学习生活和社会的政治生活、生产斗争结合起来，充分发挥少先队的作用，开展共产主义的儿童运动。为了更好地发挥少先队的作用，当前要破除的思想障碍就是“运动过时论”。“运动过时论”者认为：在建设时期，少先队不应当再搞什么运动，而只应当“安分守己”地帮助儿童学好课堂知识。他们忽视了少先队的特点，排斥那些和课堂没有直接联系的、但是具有重大教育意义的内容丰富而生动的各种活动。他们用陈旧的教育观点去对待社会主义的新事物。他们不了解：少先队和学校的关系是相辅相成的，它们有共同点，这就是说，它们的教育目的是一致的；但是又有不同点，就是说，学校主要通过讲授的办法教育儿童，少先队主要通过儿童自己的实践进行教育。少先队是少年儿童自我教育的组织，而不是学校的附属组织；因此少先队决不应该“学校化”。我们要积极帮助少先队去参加社会主义建设的公共生产劳动，做他们喜爱的有意义的适合少年儿童特点的事情。要放手让少先队员自己办队，自己活动。这样，少先队就会有声有色、有生气，更有效地培养起儿童的共产主义精神。
    还有一些人看不起儿童，他们认为儿童什么也不行。事实上，儿童是“人小志气大”的，幼小的心灵往往会创造奇迹。在全民大跃进的形势下，儿童也是雄心勃勃，革命志气高昂的。有的儿童已经有了发明创造。例如：十二岁的张狗丢，就创造了单轮双筒水车，赛倒了当地久享盛名的“解放式水车”，群众称他为“小诸葛”。四川仁寿县蜂蜜乡石桩一社，八个少年儿童种出的皮棉，产量竟然压倒了当地群众的棉田产量。当地一般棉田每亩只产皮棉四十斤，他们的棉田每亩出产一百三十五斤。他们还要为每亩产皮棉三百五十斤而奋斗。浙江于潜县交口小学的学生，大胆革新，想办法让小麦长出六、七个穗。当地群众看了他们种出的小麦，惊讶地说：“这简直长成高粱了！”
    今年的“六一节”正是在党的八届二次大会以后。我们的党所制定的社会主义建设总路线，是照耀一切工作的灯塔。我们应该把总路线的红旗插到儿童教育的领域中，破资产阶级的思想，立无产阶级的思想，把儿童教育和社会主义建设的伟大实践密切结合起来，让儿童在各项实践中受到教育，把儿童培养成为有文化的爱劳动的建设共产主义的后备军。
