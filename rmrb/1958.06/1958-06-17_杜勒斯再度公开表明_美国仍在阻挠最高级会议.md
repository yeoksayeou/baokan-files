Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 16th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reiterated his attitude on television on the 15th, showing that the U.S. ruling group is trying its best to delay holding a top-level meeting. He said that it would probably take a few more months before the United States could reach a conclusion on whether it was worthwhile to convene a top-level meeting.

In his speech, Dulles stated that the U.S. government would continue to pursue its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people. Dulles slapped himself in the face by admitting that it was "foolish" to "insist that it (China) does not exist," but he also said that the policy of non-recognition of China was "in the best interests of the United States," and that the United States would only "deal" with China when it was "beneficial to the United States."

Prior to this, Dulles said at a press conference on the 10th that if an agreement was reached on the issue of ceasing nuclear tests, he believed that monitoring stations "must" be set up on mainland China. However, he insisted on ignoring the status of great China and rejected China's participation in resolving major international issues such as the cessation of nuclear tests. Dulles attempted to create obstacles in advance for reaching an agreement on supervising the cessation of nuclear tests by using this method.

Dulles said he hoped to hold similar talks with de Gaulle and the French Foreign Minister in Paris "soon."

Dulles once again clamored for "better preparation than in the past" to cope with the Soviet Union's "challenge" in the economic field. He admitted that U.S. foreign "aid" was intended to "help" the U.S. economy, that is, to export the U.S. economic crisis. At the same time, Dulles stated that he did not think it was "necessary" to implement new large-scale "aid" plans for so-called underdeveloped countries at present. (Attached picture)

### 杜勒斯再度公开表明  美国仍在阻挠最高级会议

    杜勒斯再度公开表明
    美国仍在阻挠最高级会议
    据新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯15日在电视谈话中再度表明了美国统治集团竭力拖延举行最高级会议的态度。他说，大概要再过几个月美国才能就是否值得召开一次最高级会议的问题得出结论。
    杜勒斯在谈话中表明，美国政府将坚持奉行敌视中国人民的政策。杜勒斯自打耳光地承认，“硬说它（指中国）不存在”是“愚蠢的”，但是他又说，不承认中国的政策是“适合美国的最大利益的”，美国只在“对美国有利的时候”同中国“打交道”。
    在这以前，杜勒斯曾经在10日举行的记者招待会上说什么如果就停止核试验问题达成协议，他认为“必须”在中国大陆上设立监视站，但是他又坚持无视伟大中国地位的态度，排斥中国参预关于停止核试验等重大国际问题的解决。杜勒斯企图用这种办法来为达成监督停止核试验的协议预先制造障碍。
    杜勒斯说，他希望“很快”能在巴黎同戴高乐和法国外长举行类似的会谈。
    杜勒斯又一次叫嚷要“比过去有更好的准备”来应付苏联在经济方面的“挑战”。他承认，美国对外“援助”是为了“帮助”美国经济，也就是说，输出美国经济危机。同时，杜勒斯表示，他认为现在还“不需要”对所谓不发达国家实行新的大规模“援助”计划。（附图片）
    杜勒斯：“走开，你难道没有看到我正在忙着吗？”
