Two "Child Prodigies"
	In the Banlan Township Agricultural Cooperative, Rong'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, there is a three-year-old girl named Qin Zhenxuan. Her parents go out to work every day, and there is no one else at home, so she goes to play at the home of Zhang Mingfeng, a small vendor next door, every day. This girl wanted to learn every word on the cigarette boxes she saw. After more than ten days, she recognized many words on the cigarette boxes; she could also recognize "Chairman Mao" and "Long Live the Communist Party." From the beginning of April to now, she has been able to recognize more than 130 Chinese characters with different sounds and meanings.
	Liang Xianwei, the boy of Liang Rongfen, a member of the salt group in Qiaoxu Street, Guixian County, is only four years old this year, but he can recognize 500 characters, write more than 100 characters, and can read ordinary books and newspapers (such as "Teenager's Newspaper," but he cannot understand the content).
	When this child was three years old, he often saw his father and neighbors reading books and newspapers. In such a learning environment, he also developed a strong interest in cultural learning. He often asked his father, "What is this character?" "What is that picture?" After his father told him, he could remember them all. Later, he used charcoal or branches to learn to write on the ground himself. Now, he can recognize, write, and read most ordinary characters.

　　两个“神童”
    广西僮族自治区融安板榄乡农业社有一个三岁的女孩，叫秦振萱。她父母每天都出外劳动，家里也没有别人，因此她每天都到隔壁小摊贩张鸣凤家里玩。这女孩看到每个烟盒上的字都要学。十多天后，很多烟盒上的字她都认得了；她还能认“毛主席”、“共产党万岁”。从四月初到现在，她已能认识一百三十多个不同音义的汉字。
    贵县桥墟街食盐小组组员梁荣芬的男孩梁显威，今年只四岁，就能识五百个字，能写一百多个字，还能看普通的书报（如少年报，但不能理解内容）。
    这个孩子三岁时常见父亲和邻人阅读书报，在这样的学习环境里，他对文化学习也发生了浓厚的兴趣，经常问父亲这是什么字？那是什么图？他父亲告诉他后，他都能一一记住。后来，他自己又用火炭或树枝在地上学写字。现在，他对一般普通的字都能认能写能读了。
