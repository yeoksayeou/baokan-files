	Dragon Boat Festival Folk Customs

	Today is the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, the Dragon Boat Festival. The Dragon Boat Festival is also known as "Double Fifth Festival" or "Calamus Festival." On this day in 278 BC, the patriotic poet Qu Yuan of our country, feeling that King Huai of Chu listened to slander, and the country was ruined, drowned himself in the Miluo River out of grief and indignation. The people sympathize with and cherish this great patriotic poet. To this day, customs such as "dragon boat racing" and "wrapping zongzi" are said to be to commemorate Qu Yuan.
	However, the Dragon Boat Festival did not originate from commemorating Qu Yuan, and "dragon boat racing" existed long before Qu Yuan. Initially, people regarded the fifth day of the fifth month as an inauspicious day, and even the parents of children born on this day were unwilling to raise them. People hoped to "turn bad luck into good fortune" and "turn disaster into auspiciousness" on this day, so various customs to ward off ghosts and eliminate diseases arose. "Jingchu Chronicle" records: "On the fifth day of the fifth month, the four peoples... collect mugwort to make into human figures and hang them on doors to ward off poisonous air." "Materia Medica Illustrated" states: "On the fifth day of the fifth month, drinking calamus and realgar wine can ward off all diseases and prohibit all insects." May is the beginning of summer, and the intense heat is approaching, which is the time when epidemics are most prevalent. These customs can be said to have been a widespread hygiene and epidemic prevention movement at that time.
	"Dragon boat racing" is a major game activity of the Dragon Boat Festival. It is said that this activity originated in the Wu Kingdom with "welcoming Wu Jun against the tide," which is related to Wu Zixu. There are also those who say it originated with King Goujian of Yue. These are legends that are difficult to verify, but the Jiangnan region is a land of rivers and lakes. People who grow up in this area are familiar with water and have mastered navigation technology, so racing can be regarded as a review of navigation technology, and it can also be said to be the earliest sports competition of our ancestors. Racing did not necessarily have to be carried out on the fifth day of the fifth month in the past. "Wuling Dragon Boat Racing Examination": "According to the old system, the awnings of the boats are removed on the eighth day of the fourth month, the new boats are launched on the first day of the fifth month, and the boat races are held on the tenth and fifteenth days of the fifth month." This shows that shipbuilding and trial voyages in the Wuling area are mostly carried out in April and May after the plum rain season, when the rivers and lakes rise. After the new boat is completed, there is a series of trial voyage competitions, so the local saying that a good thing is overdue is "the boat is built and the Dragon Boat Festival is over." Later, due to the commemoration of Qu Yuan, new meanings were added. "Jingchu Chronicle": "On the fifth day of the fifth month, dragon boat racing is held. According to custom, it is the day Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River. People mourn his death, so they order boats to rescue him..."
	Racing is a good competitive sport. Generally, long boats with many rowers are more likely to win in the competition. However, some long boats fail because they have many people and slow oars, and are not as agile and flexible as small boats. As for the rowers, most of them are selected from fishermen who make a living by fishing, because they are often close to the water and know the water best. At that time, Deshan in Wuling was famous for having many rowers.
	Wrapping zongzi for the Dragon Boat Festival is a custom that is still widely popular, and it is said to be to commemorate Qu Yuan. At that time, people did not find Qu Yuan's body, so they wrapped glutinous rice in grass leaves and threw it into the river, asking the dragons in the river to eat zongzi, and not to eat Qu Yuan's body. "Sequel to Qi Xie Ji" states: "Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month. The people of Chu mourned him. On this day, they put rice in bamboo tubes and threw them into the water to worship him."
	The customs of the Dragon Boat Festival and many other festivals did not all start from commemorating Qu Yuan, but Qu Yuan's influence on the people is indeed too deep. Xu Wenjian's poem: "On the day mugwort tigers are hung on the door, and dragon boats race, Qu Yuan's regrets remain, and the people of Chu think of him for thousands of years." It truly expresses the feelings of the people who cherish Qu Yuan for thousands of years. "People who shed tears for the disasters of the people, the people will shed tears for him." But today, the era of dark clouds in which Qu Yuan lived is gone forever. We no longer use tears to commemorate Qu Yuan, but emulate his spirit of patriotism and leap forward more courageously.

    端阳话民俗
    文农
    今天是农历五月初五端午节。端午节又称“重午节”或“蒲节”。公元前二百七十八年的这一天，我国爱国诗人屈原因感于楚怀王听信谗言，国破家亡，悲愤地投汨罗江自杀。人民同情和怀念这位伟大的爱国诗人，至今“龙舟竞渡”、“包粽子”等习俗，据说都是为了纪念屈原的。
    但端午节并不是由纪念屈原而起的，“龙舟竞渡”也早在屈原以前就有过。起初，人们把五月五日当成一个不吉祥的日子，连这一天生的小孩父母都不愿意抚养。人们希冀在这一天能“化凶为吉”、“去祸成祥”，于是各种辟鬼除疾的习俗便产生了。“荆楚岁时记”记载：“五月五日，四民……采艾以为人，悬门户上，以禳毒气”。“本草图经”：“五月五日饮菖蒲雄黄酒，辟除百疾而禁百虫”。五月进入夏季，酷暑将临，正是时疫最多的时候，这些习俗，当时可说是一种普遍性的卫生防疫运动。
    “龙舟竞渡”是端午节的一项重大的游戏活动。据说这个活动在吴国是起于“迎伍君逆涛而上”，与伍子胥有关。还有说是起于越王勾践的。这些都是难于证实的传说，但江南是河流纵横的泽国，人们生长在这地区，很早就熟悉水性，掌握了航行技术，因此竞渡可当成一次对航行技术的检阅来看待，也可以说是我们祖先最早的体育竞技运动。竞渡在以前并不一定要到五月五日才进行。“武陵竞渡考”：“旧制四月八日揭篷打船，五月一日新船下水，五月十日、十五日划船竞赛”。这说明了武陵一带造船试船多半都在四、五月间梅雨过后，河湖水涨之际进行。新船建成之后，有一系列的试船竞技活动，所以当地俗语称好事过时为“打得船来过了端午节”。后来由于纪念屈原，便增加了新的意义了。“荆楚岁时记”：“五月五日竞渡，俗为屈原投汨罗日，伤其死故并命舟檝以拯之。……”
    竞渡是一项很好的竞技运动，参加竞赛的龙船，一般以长船挠手多易于获胜。但也有些长船因人多橹缓，不及小船精悍灵活而失败的。至于挠手多半从打渔为业的渔民中挑选，因他们经常与水为邻，最识水性，当时武陵德山就以多挠手著名。
    端午节包粽子，是现在还普遍流行的习俗，据说也是为了纪念屈原。当时，人们没有打捞到屈原的尸体，就把糯米包在草叶里面，投到河里去，要河里的蛟龙来吃粽子，而不要吃屈原的尸体。“续齐谐记”称：“屈原五月五日投汨罗水，楚人哀之，至此日，以竹筒子贮米，投水以祭之。”
    端午节以及许多节日的习俗，并不都是由纪念屈原开始的，但屈原给人民的影响确实太深了。徐文简的诗：“艾虎悬门日，龙舟竞渡时，屈原遗恨在，千载楚人思”。真是道出了千百年来人民怀念屈原的心情。“看到人民灾难而流眼泪的人，人民是会为他流眼泪的。”但是今天，屈原所处的满天乌云的时代已经一去不复返了。我们再也不用眼泪来纪念屈原，而是效法他的爱国主义的精神，更加勇猛地向前跃进。
