The people of Henan Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have completed more than 8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work after half a year of hard work. The irrigated area has been expanded from 43 million mu to 117.7 million mu, accounting for 86.6% of the province's cultivated land, basically achieving water conservancy for the entire province. This is a great victory for the people of Henan and a good example for the people of the whole country.
　　
Henan Province is one of the provinces in China with the most severe water and drought disasters in history. Before liberation, every major flood and drought caused a large number of deaths and displacements. Although the people of the province have fought against water and drought disasters for thousands of years, these disasters have always been very frequent. Now, a huge historical change has taken place: most of the province's farmland is now free from general water and drought disasters. The 48 million hard-working and courageous people of Henan have done in just a few months what could not be done in the past few thousand years, which is a great joy for the people of the whole country. From this, the people of the whole country can see more clearly that as long as everyone strives hard, other regions will be able to win the same great victory in the near future!
　　
Since the nationwide upsurge of water conservancy construction was launched last winter, Henan Province has been one of the leading regions. In the second half of last year, a great airing of views and great debates on the two roads of capitalism and socialism were carried out more thoroughly in the rural areas of Henan Province. Capitalist ideas represented by the rich middle peasants and right-leaning conservative ideas among cadres were criticized more thoroughly, and the red flag of communist ideology was raised high in the countryside. This cleared the ideological obstacles for large-scale water conservancy construction. Precisely because of this, the vast number of peasants in the province were able to launch a fierce attack on nature in the freezing cold with the heroic spirit of "kicking through the earth and breaking through the sky." They showed their bravery, resourcefulness, and invincibility in this unprecedented battle. Before last winter, Henan Province had only harnessed one Mang River; now, all parts of the province have highly promoted the communist spirit of fearlessness and cooperation, and have built a large number of various water conservancy projects, initially "managing" all the large and small rivers in the province except the Yellow River in the manner of the Mang River, making them less prone to flooding in general circumstances. Large-scale Yellow River diversion and irrigation projects have also been built along the Yellow River (some of which were jointly built with Hebei and Shandong). The people of Henan Province have many valuable innovations in water conservancy construction, such as the leaping cone, which can greatly accelerate well drilling, and the underground irrigation channel network, which can save water, land, and labor. As for other innovations in water conservancy construction tools and water lifting tools, they are emerging in an endless stream. In water conservancy construction, the people of Henan Province are not only good at creating, but also good at learning. The leading organs at all levels in Henan Province have not only vigorously promoted advanced experiences within the province, but also humbly learned from the advanced experiences of fraternal provinces and regions. As long as others have created good experiences, they immediately send people to learn from them, without any complacency or arrogance. This spirit of humble learning enables them to constantly absorb the strengths of others, constantly improve their work, and constantly move forward.
　　
When talking about the victory of water conservancy construction in Henan Province, one cannot fail to mention the two water management conferences held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China last winter under the direct guidance of the Central Committee: first, the Mang River Management Symposium, and then the Shaying River Management Symposium. At the latter conference, the famous "three-main" policy of "mainly storage, mainly small-scale, and mainly community-run" was determined. Now this policy has become the guiding ideology for water conservancy construction throughout the country. The practice of Henan Province and other regions in the past six months has proved the correctness of this water management policy. In the first eight years after liberation, due to the failure to grasp the guiding ideology of the "three-main" policy, although the state invested more than 500 million yuan in water conservancy in Henan Province and mobilized hundreds of thousands of people every year to carry out water conservancy construction, only 360 million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed. Since the implementation of the "three-main" policy last winter, the number of people participating in water conservancy construction every day has reached 10 million, and more than 8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, while the state has only invested 30 million yuan! It can be seen that the "three-main" policy can make our water conservancy construction more, faster, better, and more economical, which fully meets the requirements of the general line of socialist construction. This also shows that no matter how arduous the cause of transforming nature is, as long as we are good at formulating correct strategies and tactics in accordance with the objective laws of the development of things and fully rely on the masses, we will be invincible and overcome all difficulties.
　　
The fact that Henan Province has basically realized water conservancy after half a year of hard work has further strengthened our confidence in the victory of the great leap forward in agricultural production. As everyone knows, the small area of irrigated land and paddy fields, which cannot withstand the attack of water and drought disasters, is the most important reason for the low agricultural output in northern China. Now that Henan Province has first realized basic water conservancy, freeing most of the farmland from the threat of ordinary water and drought disasters, this has created the most favorable conditions for realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production. We hope that all provinces in the north will redouble their efforts to turn most of the farmland into irrigated land and paddy fields in one or two or three years. If this is done, these provinces will be fully able to "cross the Yellow River and cross the Yangtze River" in agricultural output in the shortest possible time. In the southern provinces of China, the rainfall conditions are generally better than those in the northern regions, but they are also often attacked by water and drought disasters and mountain floods. We hope that the southern provinces, like the people of Henan Province, will give full play to their revolutionary spirit and basically realize water conservancy in the shortest possible time, freeing themselves from the threat of ordinary water and drought disasters. This is of extremely great significance for realizing and overfulfilling the targets for per-mu yield of grain, cotton, and oil crops as stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
　　
It should be pointed out that the basic water conservancy realized in Henan Province is only water conservancy that can cope with ordinary water and drought disasters, and it can also be said to be preliminary water conservancy. To overcome greater water and drought disasters, further efforts are needed. From now on, water conservancy construction in Henan Province is entering a new stage of development, that is, on the basis of implementing the "three-main" policy, "taking small-scale as the foundation, medium-scale as the backbone, and combining large, medium, and small-scale," continue to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction at a higher level, and strive to eradicate natural disasters that are greater than ordinary water and drought disasters. We wish the people of Henan Province new and greater victories in water conservancy construction!

### 河南人民做出了好榜样

　　河南人民做出了好榜样
    河南省人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，经过半年苦战，完成土、石方八十亿多公方，灌溉面积由四千三百万亩扩大到一亿一千七百多万亩，占全省耕地的86.6％，全省基本上实现了水利化。这是河南人民的伟大胜利，也给全国人民做出了好榜样。
    河南省是我国历史上水旱灾害最严重的省份之一。解放前，每一次大水和大旱，都造成大量人口的死亡和流离失所。尽管全省人民同水旱灾害斗争了几千年，然而水旱灾害总是十分频繁。现在，一个巨大的历史性变化发生了：全省大部分农田已经可以免除一般的水旱灾害。四千八百万勤劳勇敢的河南省人民在短短的几个月里做出了过去几千年做不到的事情，对全国人民是一件大喜事。全国人民从这里可以更加清楚地看到，只要大家努力奋斗，在不久的将来，其他地区也能赢得同样伟大的胜利！
    自从去年冬季全国掀起汹涌澎湃的水利建设高潮以来，河南省一直是走在最前面的地区之一。去年下半年，河南省各地农村中进行大鸣大放，关于资本主义和社会主义的两条道路的大辩论进行得比较彻底，以富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想和干部中的右倾保守思想，受到了比较彻底的批判，共产主义思想的红旗在农村中高高插起。这就为大规模地进行水利建设扫清了思想障碍。正因为这样，全省广大农民就能以“踢破地球冲破天”的磅礴的英雄气概，在冰天雪地中向自然猛烈冲击。他们在这场史无前例的战斗中表现出骁勇善战，足智多谋，愈战愈强，所向披靡。去年冬季以前，河南省还只治理了一条漭河；现在，全省各地高度发扬共产主义的大无畏精神和协作精神，建设了大量的多种多样的水利工程，把全省除黄河以外的大大小小的河流都按照漭河的样子初步“管理”起来，使它们在一般情况下不容易泛滥成灾了。在黄河边上还兴建规模巨大的引黄灌溉工程（其中有的工程是同河北、山东共同兴建的）。河南省人民在水利建设中有许多宝贵的创造，例如可以大大加速打井进度的跃进锥，能够省水、省地、省工的地下灌溉渠道网等创造，都已闻名全国。至于其他水利施工工具和提水工具方面的创造，更是层出不穷。河南省人民在水利建设中，不但善于创造，也善于学习。河南省各级领导机关，不但大力推广了省内的先进经验，而且虚心地学习兄弟省区的先进经验。只要人家创造了好的经验，他们马上就派人去学，没有一点自满，没有一点架子。这种虚心学习的精神，使他们能够不断地吸收别人的长处，不断地改进自己的工作，不断地前进。
    谈到河南省水利建设的胜利时，不能不提到去年冬季中共河南省委在中央直接指导下召开的两次治水会议：先是漭河治理座谈会，后是沙颍河治理座谈会。在后一次会议上，确定了有名的“以蓄为主、小型为主、社办为主”的“三主”方针。现在这个方针已经成为全国各地水利建设的指导思想。河南省和其他地区半年来的实践，已经证明了这个治水方针的正确性。解放后的前八年中，由于没有掌握“三主”的指导思想，虽然国家在河南省的水利上投资了五亿多元，每年动员了数十万人去进行水利建设，但是只完成了土、石方三亿六千万公方。去年冬季以来贯彻执
  行了“三主”方针，在短短的半年中间，每天参加水利建设的人数达到一千万人，完成了土、石方八十亿多公方，而国家仅仅投资三千万元！由此可见，“三主”方针能够使我们的水利建设进行得又多又快又好又省，完全符合社会主义建设总路线的要求。这也说明，不论改造自然的事业是多么艰巨，只要我们善于按照事物发展的客观规律制定正确的战略战术，充分依靠群众，就一定能战无不胜，攻无不克。
    河南省苦战半年基本实现水利化的事实，更加增强了我们对于农业生产大跃进的胜利信心。大家知道，水浇地和水田面积太小，经不起水、旱灾害的袭击，是我国北方地区农业产量不高的最主要的原因。现在河南省首先实现了基本水利化，使大多数农田摆脱了普通水旱灾害的威胁，这就为实现农业生产大跃进创造了最有利的条件。我们希望北方各省都加倍努力，争取在一两年或两三年内使大部分农田变成水浇地和水田。做到了这点，这些省就完全有可能在最短时期内使农业产量“跨黄河，过长江”。我国南方各省，雨水条件一般比北方地区为好，但是，也常常遭受水旱和山洪灾害的袭击。我们希望南方各省，也像河南省的人民一样，充分发挥革命的干劲，在最短期间基本实现水利化，摆脱普通水旱灾害的威胁。这对于提前实现和超额完成农业发展纲要所规定的粮食、棉花和油料作物亩产量的指标具有极其重大的意义。
    应当指出，河南省基本实现的水利化还只是可以应付普通水旱灾害的水利化，也可以说是初步水利化。要战胜更大的水旱灾害，还需要作进一步的努力。从现在起，河南省的水利建设正进入一个新的发展阶段，这就是在贯彻“三主”方针的基础上，“以小型为基础、以中型为骨干，大、中、小型结合”，继续进行大规模的更高水平的水利建设，为根除比普通水旱灾害更大的天灾而奋斗。我们预祝河南省人民在水利建设上获得新的更大的胜利！
