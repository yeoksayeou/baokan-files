Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st: Kang Jinbo, Party Branch Secretary of the Xiqian Agricultural Cooperative in Chengnan Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, Kang Fushou, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch, and Chen Fushun, leader of the Eleventh Production Team, jointly cultivated 1.19 mu of early rice experimental field, which yielded a total of 1817.5 jin of dry grain, with an average yield of 1527.3 jin per mu. This figure is 137.1 jin more than the 1390.2 jin per mu created by Zeng Qingxi, the head of Yancuo Township, Longxi County, in his experimental field, and 543.3 jin more than the highest early rice yield of 984 jin per mu in Fujian Province last year.

　　The experimental field of the Xiqian Agricultural Cooperative is a saline-alkali field on a small island in the Jiulong River, with an early rice yield of 680 jin per mu last year. During the early rice harvest this year, the Longxi County Party Committee had people on site to supervise the harvest, from the start of harvesting to drying, threshing, and weighing. This experimental field was plowed before the "Winter Solstice" last year, and then dug three inches deeper with a hoe, for a total deep plowing of nine inches. It was plowed three times and harrowed three times during the spring plowing. Rice seedlings were transplanted at the "Spring Equinox" with a dense planting density of 4×6 inches between plants and rows. Each mu was applied with 1,000 dan of base fertilizer (soil fertilizer), 35 dan of water fertilizer, and 20 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer. After transplanting, topdressing was applied twice, with a total of 30 dan of water fertilizer and 8 jin of fertilizer powder, and two rounds of "baking the fields" (i.e., draining the water from the paddy fields and exposing them to the sun) were carried out, and "666" pesticide powder was also sprayed. Each mu had 250,000 seedlings, with thick stalks and large ears, and no lodging or white ears were found.

    建早稻单产初露头角
    溪墘社破全省最高纪录
    新华社福州21日电  福建省龙溪县城内乡溪墘农业社党支部书记康锦波、共青团支部副书记康福寿和第十一生产队队长陈福顺合种的一亩一分九厘早稻试验田，共收干谷一千八百一十七斤五两，平均亩产一千五百二十七斤三两。这个数字比龙溪县颜厝乡乡长曾清溪试验田创造的亩产一千三百九十斤二两多一百三十七斤一两，比福建省去年早稻最高亩产量九百八十四斤多五百四十三斤三两。
    溪墘农业社的这块试验田，是九龙江一个小岛上的盐碱田，去年早稻亩产量六百八十斤。今年收割早稻时，从开镰收割到晒干扬净过秤，中共龙溪县委都有人在场监收。这块试验田在去年“冬至”前翻犁，随后又用锄头挖深三寸，共计深翻九寸。春耕时又经过三犁三耙。“春分”时插秧，密植程度是株行距4×6寸，每亩施基肥（土肥）一千担，水肥三十五担，杂肥二十担。插秧后又追肥两次，共水肥三十担，肥田粉八斤，并实行两次烤田（即把稻田的水排出由太阳晒），还喷射过“六六六”药粉。每亩稻苗二十五万蔸，秆粗穗大，没有一丛倒伏和白穗。
