　　Raincoats made in Shanghai under the brands Moon, Earth, and Aviation are very popular with customers, but the sizes are incomplete. Especially for women's raincoats, there are no large sizes, such as 119 cm or 122 cm, which prevents people with larger builds from buying these brands. International friends who see these Chinese-made raincoats find their styles beautiful and practical, and they also like to buy them, but the lack of large sizes disappoints them. Once, a female international friend saw this type of raincoat in the Beijing Department Store and insisted on buying one. However, there were no large sizes available for women. In the end, a salesperson at the department store temporarily altered a men's raincoat to sell to this customer. It is hoped that the units in Shanghai that manufacture raincoats will produce large-size raincoats to meet the needs of consumers.  Sun Yijin

　　需要大号风雨衣
    上海出产的月球、大地、航空等牌子的风雨衣很受顾客欢迎，但规格不全，特别是女用的，没有大号，一一九公分一二二公分的都没有，使身材较大的人不能买到这几种牌子的雨衣。国际友人看到我国生产的这几种风雨衣式样美观，又适用，也很喜欢买，但没有大号的，使他们很失望。曾经有一位女国际友人在北京百货大楼看到这种雨衣，一定要买一件，但女式的没大号的，最后百货大楼的营业员以男式的临时改成女式的卖给了这位顾客，希望上海制做风雨衣的单位制做大号的雨衣，满足消费者的需要。  孙一津
