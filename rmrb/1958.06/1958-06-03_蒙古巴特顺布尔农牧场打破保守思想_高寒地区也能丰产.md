Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar – The fact that Mongolia's state-run Bat Shunbul Farm has increased its agricultural and pastoral products breaks the conservative notion that it is difficult to increase agricultural and pastoral production in high-altitude areas. When a Xinhua News Agency reporter visited the farm on May 26, farm director Dala Muzhabu used the vivid example of the farm's substantial increase in agricultural and pastoral products to illustrate this point.

The Bat Shunbul Farm is located 200 li (approximately 100 kilometers) from the Mongolian capital in a high-altitude area 1,300 meters above sea level, where the minimum temperature reaches minus 57 degrees Celsius. However, in this farm, which mainly produces vegetables and milk, the yield of Chinese cabbage reaches 86 tons per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu), and potatoes reach 41 tons, far exceeding the national targets. The annual milk production of each Mongolian dairy cow reaches 1,700 liters, making it the highest yield in the country.

When introducing the increase in agricultural and pastoral products on the farm, Director Dala Muzhabu said that when this farm, which is only five years old, was established, worker Doleger, who had just started learning agricultural techniques, created a record potato yield. Based on the climate and soil conditions here, he fertilized, sowed, and managed the crops, resulting in bumper harvests every year. Cui Jinhuan, a Chinese worker who helped Mongolia build its agriculture, and his production team have continuously improved the unit area yield of vegetables through intensive cultivation and rational irrigation. Cui Jinhuan and the members of his production team were awarded the Sukhe-Bator Medal and the Gold Star Medal by the Mongolian government.

Milker Airmid has been working as a milker since 1955. The average milk production of the cows under her management increased from 1,050 liters to 1,700 liters in 1957. A production team on the farm promoted her advanced milking methods and also overfulfilled their milking tasks. Airmid was awarded the country's highest award - the Sukhe-Bator Medal.

The farm's pasture is located on the Sogleg River. It is shaded by green trees and has lush grass. The cows have been let out to pasture, and the calves are strolling in the meadow. The reporter met Airmid's husband, production team leader Haole. He told the reporter that this year the production team's milking target has been increased to an average of 1,100 liters per cow (the national target is 800 liters), and Airmid's personal target is 2,000 liters. The peak milking season has already begun, and each dairy cow is already able to produce about five liters of milk per day.

　　蒙古巴特顺布尔农牧场打破保守思想
    高寒地区也能丰产
    据新华社乌兰巴托电  蒙古国营巴特顺布尔农牧场农牧业产品增产的事实打破了高寒地区农牧业产品增产困难的保守说法。新华社记者在5月26日访问这个农牧场时，场长达拉木扎布用这个农牧场的农牧业产品大量增产的生动事例说明了这点。
    巴特顺布尔农牧场位于距离蒙古首都两百里、拔海一千三百公尺的高寒地区，这里的最低气温达零下五十七度。但是，在这个以生产蔬菜和牛乳为主的农牧场中，每公顷（合十五市亩）的白菜产量达到八十六吨、马铃薯达到四十一吨，远远超过国家规定的指标；每头蒙古乳牛每年的奶产量达到一千七百公升，成为目前全国的最高产量。
    达拉木扎布场长在介绍这个农牧场的农牧业产品增产的情况时说，在这个只有五年历史的农牧场建场时才开始学习农业技术的工人道勒格尔创造了马铃薯的丰产纪录，他根据这里的气候和土质进行施肥、播种和管理，年年丰收。中国援助蒙古建设的农业工人崔金换和他的生产队由于精耕细作、合理灌溉，使蔬菜的单位面积产量一再提高，崔金换和他的生产队队员分别获得蒙古政府颁发的苏赫巴托尔勋章和金星勋章。
    挤奶员阿维尔米德从1955年开始做挤奶工作，在她管理下的乳牛的平均产奶量为一千零五十公升，到1957年增加到一千七百公升。农牧场的一个生产队推行她的先进挤奶方法也超额完成了挤奶任务。阿维尔米德获得国家的最高奖励——苏赫巴托尔勋章。
    农牧场的牧场在索格勒格河边。这里绿树成荫，水草丰茂。母牛放牧去了，小牛犊在草场上漫步。记者会见了阿维尔米德的丈夫、生产队长好尔勒。他告诉记者说，今年生产队的挤奶指标平均每头牛提高到一千一百公升（国家规定的指标是八百公升），阿维尔米德的个人指标是两千公升。目前挤奶旺季已经开始，每头乳牛每天已经能够出奶五公升左右。
