    Peasants Create Wheat Harvest Miracle
    We Must Strive to Be Food Saving Models
    When we read the heartening news on the front page of the People's Daily on June 12th, "Satellite Agricultural Cooperative Launches Second 'Satellite': 2.9 Mu of Wheat Yields 3,530 Jin Per Mu, and Hubei Happiness Cooperative's 11 Mu of Wheat Yields 3,215 Jin Per Mu," our family of four was exceptionally excited.
    Peasant brothers on the agricultural front, working tirelessly day and night, regardless of wind and rain, have created such an unprecedented miracle of abundant harvest for the motherland and the people. How could we not be happy? We sincerely congratulate them!
    Tonight, for dinner, our whole family ate steaming hot steamed buns. With every bite of the fragrant bun, we felt an indescribable gratitude in our hearts, gratitude for the great victory of the Party's leadership in the agricultural Great Leap Forward, and gratitude for the hard work of our peasant brothers!
    Although the wheat harvest is abundant, we must do our utmost to support the overall bumper harvest in agriculture. We must further formulate a food saving plan, properly educate our children not to eat snacks, and strive to be models in the food saving campaign.

    农民创造小麦丰收奇迹
    我们要争取做节粮模范
    当读了6月12日人民日报第一版头条消息“卫星农业社发出第二颗‘卫星’，二亩九分小麦亩产三千五百三十斤和湖北幸福社十一亩小麦亩产三千二百一十五斤”振奋人心的消息时，我们全家四口人异常兴奋。
    农民兄弟们在农业战线上，终日披星戴月，不顾风雨，为祖国为人民创造出这样空前大丰收的奇迹，我们怎能不高兴呢？我们衷心祝贺！
    今天晚餐，我们全家吃的是热气腾腾的大馒头。我们每吃一口香喷喷的馍馍，内心里就有一种说不出来的感激，感激党领导农业大跃进的伟大胜利，感激农民兄弟的辛勤劳动！
    小麦虽然丰收了，我们还要竭尽全力支持农业全面大丰收。我们要进一步制定节约粮食计划，好好教育孩子不吃零食，争取在节约粮食运动中做模范。　　长春市南关区北大街29组　胡景珍
