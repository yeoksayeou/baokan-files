    Shanghai Writers Participate in Labor, Spiritual Outlook Renewed

    (Our dispatch) The spiritual outlook of writers has been completely renewed after they went deep into life, participated in labor, and engaged in practical work. Before long, they will surely reap a bountiful harvest in their creations. The “Shanghai Creative Writing Group” symposium held by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association on the 9th and 10th gave people such a prominent impression.

    Many writers who are currently living, eating, working, and laboring alongside workers, peasants, soldiers in factories, rural areas, and the army attended the symposium and exchanged their experiences of going deep into life and their creative situations. Their speeches were filled with the atmosphere of the era's great leap forward, mixed with many mass vernaculars. Many people said that after going among the masses, they gained a lot ideologically and their minds were opened up. They were no longer troubled by a lack of subjects to write about, but rather had endless subjects to write about, and the images of countless heroic figures were compelling the writers to write. Many writers proposed to revise their original creative plans and create more works.

    Wu Qiang, the author of "Red Sun," said at the meeting: When I set off from Shanghai to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu in March, most of the passengers on the ship were farmers who had come to Shanghai to buy fertilizer and sprayers to take back. They talked enthusiastically about production and the Great Leap Forward, staying up all night. Passing through Nantong to Rudong County, I saw wave after wave of upsurges all the way, with the masses working with soaring enthusiasm. I couldn't understand many new terms. After being with the farmers in the countryside, I truly harvested something every day and was nourished every day. Many subjects were readily available, and the stories were already written. One township wanted to build a small-scale water conservancy project. The men all went out to build large-scale water conservancy projects, so the women took over. Women over forty years old with bound feet also participated, eating and living on the construction site. A nursery was also set up on the construction site, and a month's work was completed in half a month. A powerful force was infecting and attracting me in the rural land.

    Wang Yuanmei, a female writer and screenwriter of the film "Struggle on the Lake," is living in an agricultural cooperative in Gaoyou County for a long time. She said: In the past, when writing rural dramas, I always thought that the pace of rural life was slow, but now it is very different. The pace of rural life is so fast that people can't keep up. As soon as I heard that the township was going to set up a factory, within a few days, an iron factory, a fertilizer factory, and a hydroelectric power station were all set up. One day I heard that an agricultural middle school was going to be set up, and I always thought that there would be a period of preparation, but the next day classes started. There are all kinds of geniuses among the masses, and many words are something that writers can't even think of. Once I wrote a couplet for the farmers: "Thousands of troops and horses are building water conservancy, from all directions..." I couldn't think of anything to write here. A farmer said to me: "From all directions, water goes to the fields." After building water conservancy, the water will come to the fields by itself, which is really great.

    Zhao Zi, who works as a "pattern maker" at the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard, assembles ship bodies every day on the huge dock by the Huangpu River, amidst the sound of hammers and the light of electric welding. He said: After arriving at the factory, figures with communist style are active around me every day. Writing subjects are coming at me, everywhere. I write a little every night, and I also help the factory newspaper read manuscripts and tutor the workshop's creative writing group. A collection of short stories in the creative writing plan has now been completed, and more than a dozen other small works have also been written.

    Jin Yi and Feng Cun, who have lived in factories for a long time, Tang Tao in rural areas, Ha Hua in the army, and Lu Mang in the Public Security Bureau, all told many vivid stories and experiences at the meeting. Wei Jinzhi, an old writer who goes to the Shanghai Silk Spinning Factory twice a week as a base, also talked about his experiences in going deep into life. They all said that they tasted the sweetness in the fiery life and struggle, felt that they had strength, made close friends among the masses, and that their thoughts and feelings were close to and connected with the working people, and at the same time found an inexhaustible source of literary creation. The meeting also raised some issues in going deep into life, studied solutions, and revised the creative plans that reflect the lives of the people of Shanghai.

    Shi Ximin, Minister of Propaganda of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the beginning of the meeting. Ba Jin, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, said before the end of the meeting: Judging from everyone's very vivid and moving speeches, the future works must also be equally vivid and moving. This is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of literary and artistic workers investing themselves in the fiery struggle and literature and art serving politics, workers, peasants, and soldiers. Zhou Erfu, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, made the final speech. He hoped that everyone would create more short, concise, and powerful works, vigorously promote the general line, and quickly reflect the features of the era's Great Leap Forward.

    天天有收获　日日有营养
    深入生活　火热透心　浑身是劲
    上海作家参加劳动　精神面貌焕然一新
    本报讯　作家们深入生活、参加劳动和实际工作以后，精神面貌焕然一新，不久，他们在创作上也一定可以得到丰收。中国作家协会上海分会9、10两日召开的“上海创作小组”座谈会，给人这样一个突出的印象。
    许多正在工厂、农村、部队和工农兵同吃同住同劳动的作家们出席了这个座谈会，交流他们深入生活的体会和创作的情况。他们发言中充满了时代跃进的气息，掺和着许多群众的语汇。许多人都说，到群众中间后，思想上收获很大，心胸豁然开朗，再也不是苦于没有题材可写，而是有写不完的题材，无数英雄人物的形象逼迫着作家去写。许多作家提出要修改原订的创作规划，创作更多的作品。
    “红日”的作者吴强在会上说：当我3月份从上海出发到苏北农村的时候，一上轮船，乘客大多是来上海买了肥料、喷雾器回去的农民，他们热烈地谈生产，谈跃进，通宵不睡。经过南通，到如东县，一路上只见高潮一个接着一个，群众干劲冲天，许多新名词我都听不懂。到乡下和农民在一起以后，真是天天有收获，日日有营养。许多题材都是现成的，故事都是编好了的。有一个乡要办一个小型水利工程，男子都出去修大型水利了，就由妇女来搞。四十岁以上小脚的妇女也参加，吃在工地，住在工地，工地上还办起托儿所，一个月的工程半个月完成。农村的土地上有着一股强大的力量感染着我，吸引着我。
    电影“湖上的斗争”的编剧、女作家王元美正长期住在高邮县一个农业社里。她说：过去写农村戏，总认为农村的节奏是缓慢的，现在大不同，农村的节奏快得叫人跟不上。刚听说乡里要办工厂，过几天，铁工厂、肥料厂、水电站，样样办起来了。头一天听说要办农业中学，我总以为要有一个时期的准备工作，那知道第二天就上课了。群众中各种天才都有，许多话都是作家想也想不出的。有一次我替农民写一副对联：“千军万马修水利，四面八方……”，写到这里想不出了。一位农民跟我说：“四面八方水上田”，修了水利，水自己上田来，真是太好了。
    在上海中华造船厂当“出样工”的赵自，每天在黄浦江边巨大的船台上，在鎯头声中和电焊光下装配船体。他说：到了厂里，具有共产主义风格的人物天天活跃在我的周围，写作的题材扑面而来，处处都是。每天晚上写一点，还帮助厂报看稿，辅导车间的创作小组。现在创作规划中的一个短篇集已完成，另外还写了十多篇小作品。
    长期在工厂生活的作家靳以、丰村，在农村的唐弢，在部队的哈华，在公安局的芦芒等都在会上讲了许多生动的故事和体会。以上海绢纺厂为基点每周下厂两次的老作家魏金枝，也讲了他深入生活中的体会，他们都说在火热的生活和斗争中尝到了甜头，感到自己有力量了，在群众中交上了知心朋友，思想感情也与劳动人民接近了，通气了，同时也找到了文学创作的取之不竭的源泉。会上还提出了深入生活中的一些问题，研究了解决的办法，并且修订了各个反映上海人民生活的创作规划。
    中共上海市委宣传部长石西民在会议开始时讲了话。作协上海分会主席巴金在会议结束前说：从大家的十分生动感人的发言看来，将来的作品也一定同样的生动感人。这是贯彻毛主席指出的文艺工作者投入到火热的斗争中去、文艺为政治为工农兵服务的方针的结果。作协上海分会副主席周而复最后发言，他希望大家多创作一些短小精悍的作品，大力宣传总路线，迅速地反映时代大跃进的面貌。
