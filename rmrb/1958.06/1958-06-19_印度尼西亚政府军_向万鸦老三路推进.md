Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 18th: Indonesian government forces are advancing on Manado, the last stronghold of the rebels. Government forces that landed near Gema have already occupied the city and six towns between it and Manado. Gema is only about thirty kilometers from Manado. Government forces that landed on the northern coast of Manado and at Bitung port east of Manado are advancing towards the heart of the rebel territory from both sides.

The rebel group crowded at the top of this narrow island is now in a very difficult situation. It is reported that the people's guerrillas in the Manado area have been very active in the past two or three days, often opening fire on the rebels at night. Many rebels have fled Manado city, intending to make contact with the advancing government forces.

The rebels in Central Sulawesi are also constantly attacked by government forces and people's armed forces. A youth armed force has already controlled the Kolonodale area southeast of Poso and the Ruo area near the Peleng Strait. Another guerrilla force is very active near Poso. They have recovered many places and are advancing towards Poso and Tentena, which are occupied by the rebels.

    印度尼西亚政府军
    向万鸦老三路推进
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚政府军正在向叛军的最后基地万鸦老进军。在格马附近登陆的政府军已经占领了这个城市以及它和万鸦老之间的六个市镇。格马距万鸦老只有三十公里左右。在万鸦老北部海岸和在万鸦老东方的比东港登陆的政府军正从两方面向叛军的心脏地带推进。
    拥挤在这个狭长岛屿顶端的叛乱集团现在已经处在非常困难的境地。据报道，最近两三天来，万鸦老地区的人民游击队很活跃，他们常常在夜间对叛军开火。许多叛军已经逃出万鸦老城，打算同推进中的政府军取得联系。
    中苏拉威西的叛军也不断受到政府军和人民武装部队的袭击。一支青年武装部队已经控制了波梭东南的哥罗诺达里地区和佩伦海峡附近的鲁沃地区。另有一支游击队在波梭附近非常活跃。他们已经收复了许多地方，并且正在向叛军占领的波梭和登德那推进。
