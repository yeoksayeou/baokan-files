    Chenxi Muzhou Agricultural Cooperative
    Citrus Yield of 13,650 Jin Per Mu
    The Muzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Chenxi County, Hunan Province, is located on an island in the upper reaches of the Yuan River. In 1957, this cooperative harvested more than 598,800 jin of citrus, an increase of 111.8% compared to 1956, with an average yield of 4,718 jin per mu; the highest three and a half mu averaged 13,650 jin per mu. The factors contributing to the increased production of this cooperative are, first and foremost, mastering the principle of "seasonal fertilization" in fertilization, applying fertilizer four times throughout the year. Secondly, green manure was planted in 80% of the citrus orchards to supplement the lack of fertilizer. They also did a very good job in the prevention and control of citrus orchard diseases and insect pests and in the cultivation of citrus orchards.

    辰溪木洲农业社
    亩产柑桔13650斤
    湖南省辰溪县木洲农业社在沅江上游的一个洲上。这个社1957年收获柑桔五十九万八千八百多斤，比1956年增产111.8％，每亩平均产四千七百一十八斤；最高的三亩半每亩平均一万三千六百五十斤。这个社获得增产的因素，首先是在施肥上掌握了“分季施肥”的原则，全年施肥四次。其次，在80％的桔园中种植了绿肥，用来补助肥料的不足。他们对桔园病虫害的防治和桔园的中耕也都作得很好。
