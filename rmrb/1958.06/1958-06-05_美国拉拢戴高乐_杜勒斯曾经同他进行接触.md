Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 4th: The United States government is making every effort to win over De Gaulle, who has just come to power.

The U.S. Ambassador to Paris delivered a letter from U.S. President Eisenhower to De Gaulle on the evening of the 3rd. The letter expressed "congratulations and wishes" for De Gaulle's rise to power, and told De Gaulle that he could be "assured" of Eisenhower's "sympathy and understanding." According to some congressional figures, Eisenhower took this action quickly in order to strengthen relations with the De Gaulle government. It is revealed that, in addition to Eisenhower, Dulles also had contact with De Gaulle.

Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Elbrick also tried to please De Gaulle while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the same day, emphasizing that the U.S. government "had long seen the possibility of De Gaulle regaining power."

Democratic Senator Humphrey on the same day requested that De Gaulle be invited to Washington for talks as soon as possible, so that France would be "very reassured" about the United States.

    杜勒斯曾经同他进行接触
    据新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在竭力拉拢刚刚上台的戴高乐。
    美国驻巴黎大使3日晚上把美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信交给戴高乐。这封信对戴高乐上台表示“祝贺和祝愿”，并且告诉戴高乐可以“确信”艾森豪威尔对他的“同情和谅解”。据一些国会人士说，艾森豪威尔所以迅速采取这个行动，是为了要加强同戴高乐政府的关系。据透露，除了艾森豪威尔以外，杜勒斯也曾经同戴高乐进行过接触。
    负责欧洲事务的助理国务卿埃尔布里克同一天在参议院外交委员会上作证时也竭力讨好戴高乐，强调美国政府“早就看到戴高乐重掌政权的可能性”。
    美国民主党参议员汉弗来同一天要求邀请戴高乐来华盛顿早日举行会谈，以使法国对美国“非常放心”。
