    Oil Workers Advance with Songs
    Setting a Standard at Yumen Pass
    Leap Forward red flags are waving,
    Striving to be the first and foremost.
    Our songs shake the heavens and earth,
    Oil workers declare war on the land.
    Conquer the Gobi Desert,
    Drill through the Qilian Mountains;
    Galloping into the Turpan Basin,
    Setting a standard at Yumen Pass.
    Oil flowers bloom everywhere
    Grasp the region and spread the net,
    Automobiles, donkeys, and camels are all utilized.
    Big drills, small drills, manual digging,
    Self-flowing, pumping, windlass turning.
    Big factories, small factories, pots boiling,
    Oil flowers bloom everywhere.

    Schools Build Oil Refineries
    Great development of the petroleum industry,
    Blooming everywhere like stars in the sky,
    For the sake of the industrialization of the capital,
    We are determined to build refineries.
    Cheering for the great construction of the motherland,
    The petroleum industry must take the lead,
    Teachers, students, and staff have great enthusiasm,
    Determined to infuriate Britain!

    石油工人高歌猛进
    玉门关上立标杆
    跃进红旗招展，
    力争一马当先。
    我们的歌声震天动地，
    石油工人向大地宣战。
    战胜戈壁滩，
    钻透祁连山；
    快马加鞭进军吐鲁番，
    玉门关上立标杆。
    处处盛开石油花
    抓住区域把网撒，
    汽车毛驴骆驼化。
    大钻小钻人工挖，
    自喷抽油辘轳把。
    大厂小厂锅子熬，
    处处盛开石油花。
      （玉门油矿）
    学校建油厂
    石油工业大发展，
    遍地开花星满天，
    为了首都工业化，
    决心要把炼厂建。
    欢呼祖国大建设，
    石油工业要领先，
    师生员工干劲大，
    决心气死不列颠！
