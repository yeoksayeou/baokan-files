    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 12th: President Sukarno said on the evening of the 12th that he protests the United States' hydrogen bomb tests on Eniwetok Atoll. He said that although Eniwetok Atoll is thousands of kilometers away from Indonesia, in terms of atomic radioactivity, conducting tests there is practically like conducting tests next door to the Presidential Palace. Sukarno said emotionally: "As the father of my children, as the head of the Indonesian state, and as an Asian, I protest hydrogen bomb tests."

    President Sukarno also said: "As a human being, even if atomic and hydrogen bomb tests are conducted in places like New York and London, I will protest."

    In his speech, Sukarno pointed out that we wholeheartedly welcome the Soviet Union's decision and hope that other countries possessing nuclear weapons will follow the Soviet Union's example.

    Sukarno's speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    President Sukarno delivered his speech at the opening ceremony of "Anti-Atomic Bomb and Hydrogen Bomb Movement Week" held at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta. Several thousand people from all walks of life in Indonesia attended the opening ceremony, including cabinet ministers, members of parliament and members of the National Council, Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Suwirjo, Indonesian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Lukman, and Partai Sarekat Islam Indonesia Chairman Arbas.

    The meeting then passed a declaration. The declaration stated that the Indonesian people are very concerned about the series of hydrogen bomb explosion tests started this summer by the British government on Christmas Island and the U.S. government on Eniwetok Atoll.

    The declaration also said that these nuclear weapon tests have aggravated international tensions. The declaration protested against atomic and hydrogen bomb tests being conducted anywhere and urged countries that possess nuclear weapons and continue to conduct explosion tests to immediately stop the tests.

    From today onwards, various mass rallies will be held in Jakarta every day to oppose the United States and Britain conducting nuclear weapon tests.

    苏加诺抗议美国试验氢弹
    印度尼西亚人民举行反对氢弹大会
    据新华社雅加达12日电 苏加诺总统12日晚上说，他抗议美国在恩纳威托克岛举行氢弹试验。他说，虽然恩纳威托克岛距离印度尼西亚有几千公里，但是，就原子放射性说来，在那里举行试验就简直像在总统府的隔壁举行试验一样。苏加诺激动地说：“作为我的孩子们的父亲，作为印度尼西亚国家的元首，作为一个亚洲人，我抗议氢弹试验”。
    苏加诺总统还说：“作为一个人，即使在纽约和伦敦等地举行原子弹和氢弹试验，我也要抗议”。
    苏加诺在演说中指出，我们衷心欢迎苏联的决定，并且希望拥有核武器的其他国家效法苏联的榜样。
    苏加诺的演说受到了听众的热烈欢迎。
    苏加诺总统是在雅加达总统府举行的“反对原子弹和氢弹运动周”的开幕式上发表演说。印度尼西亚各界人士几千人参加这个开幕式，其中有内阁部长、国会议员和民族委员会委员、印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约、印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼和白尔蒂伊斯兰党主席阿巴斯等。
    会议接着通过了一项宣言。宣言说，印度尼西亚人民对于今年夏季英国政府在圣诞岛和美国政府在恩纳威托克岛开始进行的一连串的氢弹爆炸试验非常担心。
    宣言还说，这些核武器试验加剧了国际紧张局势。宣言表示抗议在任何地方举行原子弹和氢弹试验，并且敦促拥有核武器并继续进行爆炸试验的国家立即停止试验。
    从今天起，雅加达每天将举行各种群众集会，反对美国和英国进行核武器试验。
