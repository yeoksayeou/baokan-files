Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 31st - The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided on the 29th to organize a 600,000-person work inspection team to implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, convey the general line for socialist construction to every township and commune in the vast mountainous areas, every factory, mine, school, and store, and use the general line as a weapon to inspect work, summarize and promote advanced experiences, further promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and set off a high tide of technological and cultural revolution.

This unprecedentedly large work inspection team will be headed by Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, as the overall leader, with the First Secretaries of local (municipal) and autonomous prefectural party committees serving as deputy leaders. More than 30 bureau-level cadres were drawn from provincial-level agencies to participate. Together with cadres from counties, districts, townships, factories, mines, and agricultural cooperatives, the total number is approximately 600,000. The task of the inspection team is to publicize and convey the general line for socialist construction formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, ensuring that the general line becomes a household name and is implemented throughout the population and in all aspects of work; and to inspect work in the spirit of the general line, solve problems discovered on the spot, and summarize and promote advanced experiences. In agriculture, the inspection will focus on the sowing situation of crops and the relevant measures for increasing production, such as water conservancy projects and fertilizer application; the production of animal husbandry and forestry; agricultural production management, labor organization, etc. While inspecting current production measures, they will also assist in formulating plans for autumn plowing and sowing. In industry, the inspection will cover production plans, production technology measures, labor wages, mutual cooperation, and the rectification movement in various units, with particular attention to the situation of newly built factories and technological innovations. In addition, commercial work, cultural and educational work, and grain issues will also be inspected.

The Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that in the inspection, special attention should be paid to grasping ideology, seizing advanced examples, and promoting the communist style of dare to speak and dare to act, as well as the spirit of innovation and creation among grassroots cadres and workers and peasants. Through inspection, the advanced experiences from all parts of the province should be gathered, summarized, and promoted in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th - The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its Standing Committee meeting on the 29th, called on all party members and cadres in the province to immediately organize a propaganda army and go deep into the grassroots to launch a widespread and in-depth movement to publicize the general line for socialist construction throughout the province in June. The Provincial Party Committee required that this publicity campaign for the general line for socialist construction should make the general line a household name and deeply rooted in people's hearts, and rapidly push the technological and cultural revolutions to a higher level.

The meeting believed that the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, which had already successfully concluded, is a beacon illuminating the great leap forward in all aspects of work. The meeting required all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, revolutionary cadres, activists, and all propaganda forces in the province to use various forms of propaganda to conduct publicity among the people throughout the province in factories, rural areas, schools, streets, companies, shops, and all enterprise units, without any blank spots, so that all workers, peasants, students, soldiers, and residents can hear a report on the general line. In carrying out the publicity, it is required to combine the spirit of the general line with current work, examine and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, and criticize the thinking of the "wait-and-see faction" and the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest faction," so that Chairman Mao's instructions on liberating the mind and establishing a communist style are mastered by all cadres and the masses, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses are fully brought into play. During the publicity, there should be extensive airing of views and debates to launch a mass movement to inspect the leap forward targets and measures, in order to promote the current work of summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer grain distribution, and to prepare for striving for a greater harvest next year.

In order to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress as soon as possible and to effectively inspect and promote current work based on the spirit of the meeting, the meeting decided that representatives attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress should be divided into eight regions to convey the spirit throughout the province. The meeting also decided to immediately organize a 100,000-person inspection team to go deep into rural areas, factories, schools, and other grassroots units throughout the province to publicize the general line for socialist construction, participate in labor, and inspect work.

The meeting required party committees at all levels to immediately organize all cadres to study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and closely integrate this with the fourth stage of the current rectification movement, using the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress as the guiding ideology of the rectification movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 31st - Many regions in Sichuan Province have already begun to study and publicize the general line for socialist construction and implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.

Currently, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is actively organizing forces to use various forms such as street blackboards, broadcasting, and storytelling to make the spirit of the general line a household name, deeply rooted in people's hearts, and transform it into the actual strength of the entire city. The Municipal Party Committee will also convene a meeting of the party committee leaders of various factories, enterprises, universities, colleges, and agencies under its jurisdiction in the near future to convey and study the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, organize various report meetings, and conscientiously implement the spirit of the general line into all aspects of production and work in conjunction with the rectification movement.

After the announcement of the general line for socialist construction, it brought great encouragement to the vast number of workers in Zigong City, which is "working hard for three years to become a chemical city." Chen Decai, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Seventh Work Section of the No. 1 Salt Plant, immediately studied with the work section chief after seeing the documents published in the newspaper and decided to mobilize all the workers in the section to reduce the cost of salt production by 50% before the "May Day" holiday next year and to change manual operation to semi-mechanization. The peasants of Pixian County, whose small spring crops have more than doubled this year, are taking various measures under the encouragement of the general line to strive for a bumper harvest of large spring crops. The Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China is preparing to convene a meeting in early June to arrange for large-scale and in-depth publicity and implementation of the general line for socialist construction throughout the county.
