　　Marking Socialism's Newness, Establishing the Distinctiveness of the Working People
　　Chen Tao
    The world-renowned Ming Tombs Reservoir will soon be basically completed. It is said that if this project were handled according to the old conventions, it would take at least a year and a half to start construction, and another year or two to complete it. But this time, the old rules were broken: they started as soon as they said they would, surveying, planning, and constructing simultaneously. In less than half a year, a thirty-meter-high flood control dam stands before us.

    This is a brand new marvel, and it is also an inspiring thing. From this event, I also understood some simple principles.

    In the eyes of those who stick to conventions, surveying, planning, and constructing simultaneously is something they have never seen before; it is being unconventional. Indeed, it is being unconventional, but this kind of unconventionality for accelerating the speed of socialist construction is exactly what we need.

    In people's past impressions, being unconventional did not seem to be a good term. Saying that someone was being unconventional contained some irony and contempt, such as wanting to show off, or overestimating one's capabilities, and so on. Because they can't stand new things, nor do they welcome new ideas. As soon as new things and new ideas appear, they think they have crossed the line, and denounce them as heresies, especially those in the ruling class, who are afraid that this will shake their regime. Throughout history, there have been many examples of new things being suppressed and attacked. When Copernicus proposed that the sun was stationary and the earth revolved around the sun, people generally ridiculed Copernicus as an arrogant fool and a heretic, but science has long proved that it was not Copernicus who was foolish, but those who were superstitious about God. When Marx and Engels established scientific Marxism, they were also denounced by the reactionary classes and their hired scholars as heresies. Now countless facts prove that Marxism is the truth for the complete liberation of mankind. Copernicus, Marx, and Engels were all people who dared to be unconventional.

    Being unconventional is originally a good thing. Everything in the world is constantly happening and developing; the old is dying out, and the new is being born. The new must overcome the old, and inevitably replace the old. This is an objective law. The so-called being unconventional is precisely aimed at old things, and there is nothing wrong with it. The question is what "newness" you are "marking" and what "distinctiveness" you are "establishing," whether they conform to objective laws and meet the needs of the people. Whether it conforms to the universal truth of Marxism.

    Now we are exerting our utmost efforts, striving for the top, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Being unconventional for the sake of building socialism is exactly what we need. The broad masses of working people are the greatest innovators. In the socialist Great Leap Forward, people's minds have been liberated, their potential has been brought into play, and they dare to break with conventions, eliminate superstitions, and think independently, displaying creativity in work and production. What predecessors have not thought of, we dare to think; what predecessors have not done, we dare to do. Thus, old quotas and old indicators are constantly being broken through, and new inventions and new creations are constantly emerging. Just look at the newspapers since the Great Leap Forward. Among these so-called ordinary workers and peasants, how many skilled craftsmen and experts have emerged! Li Shiying, a technician of worker origin, created seven kinds of electrical processing machine tools, including the "electric spark drilling machine," in one year of hard work, and this is a subject that some engineers and university professors are still researching and have not yet solved. The vast majority of the more than 600 skilled craftsmen who reformed agricultural tools who participated in the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Technology Revolution On-the-Spot Conference were ordinary workers and peasants. It is these people who dare to create and dare to be unconventional who are promoting the advancement of our socialist cause and making our country's appearance change with each passing day. Isn't this communist style of marking socialism's newness and establishing the distinctiveness of the working people exactly what we should vigorously promote?

    Of course, there is also another kind of "being unconventional," which reverses black and white, distorts facts, does not conform to objective laws, does not meet the needs of the people, and violates the truth of Marxism, but calls it "creation" and says it is some kind of "truth." This is nonsense and has nothing in common with what we call being unconventional.

### 标社会主义之新，立劳动人民之异

　　标社会主义之新，立劳动人民之异
　　陈涛
    名闻中外的十三陵水库近日就要基本完工了。据说这个工程若按旧规矩办事，起码也要在一年半载以后才能开工，再加上一二年才能完工。但这次陈规被打破了，说干就干，边勘测，边计划，边施工。不到半年，一座三十公尺高的拦洪大坝就屹立在我们面前了。
    这是件崭新的奇闻，也是件令人振奋的事情。从这件事也使我明白了一些简单的道理。
    在墨守成规的人看来，边勘测，边计划，边施工，过去从来没有见过，这是标新立异。不错，这确是标新立异，但这种为加快社会主义建设速度的标新立异正是我们所需要的。
    在人们过去的印象中，标新立异似乎不是一个好听的词儿，说某某人在标新立异，就多少含有讽刺和轻视的意味，如想出风头呀，这是自不量力呀，等等。因为他们见不得新鲜事物，也不欢迎新的思想。新的事物，新的思想一出现，他们就认为是逾越了规矩，斥之为异端邪说，尤其是那些统治阶级更是如此，他们生怕这会动摇了他们的江山。在历史上，新生事物受到压抑、打击的事例是不少的。当哥白尼提出太阳是不动的，而地球围绕着太阳转动的时候，一般人都讥笑哥白尼是狂妄之徒和异端，但是科学早已证明愚蠢的不是哥白尼，而是那些迷信上帝的人。当马克思和恩格斯建立科学的马克思主义的时候，也被反动阶级及御用学者斥为异端邪说，现在无数的事实证明，马克思主义是人类得到彻底解放的真理。哥白尼、马克思、恩格斯都是敢于标新立异的人。
    标新立异本来是个好词儿。世界上的一切事物都在不断地发生着和发展着，旧的在灭亡，新的在诞生，新的一定胜过旧的，必然代替旧的，这是客观规律。所谓标新立异，正是针对旧的事物而言，没有什么不好。问题是看你“标”的什么“新”，“立”的什么“异”，它们是否合乎客观规律，是否切合人民的需要。是不是符合马克思主义的普遍真理。
    现在我们正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。为建设社会主义而标新立异正是我们所需要的。广大劳动人民是最伟大的标新立异者，在社会主义大跃进中，人们的思想解放了，潜力发挥了，敢于打破陈规，破除迷信，独立思考，在工作和生产中发挥创造性。前人所没有想过的，我们敢想；前人所没有作过的，我们敢作。于是旧的定额，旧的指标不断被突破，新的发明和新的创造不断涌现。看一看大跃进以来的报纸吧，在这些所谓平凡的工、农劳动群众中间，出现了多少能工巧匠和专家啊！工人出身的技师李士英苦干一年就创造出“电火花钻孔机”等七种电加工机床，而这是一些工程师和大学教授正在研究还没有解决的课题。参加河北省农业技术革命现场会议的六百多名改革农具的能工巧匠，绝大多数都是普通的工人和农民。正是这些敢于创造，敢于标新立异的人推动着我们的社会主义事业前进，使我们的国家面貌日新月异。这种标社会主义之新、立劳动人民之异的共产主义风格，难道不正是我们所要大力提倡的吗？
    当然，也有另外一种“标新立异”，它们颠倒黑白，歪曲事实，不合乎客观规律，不切合人民的需要，违反马克思主义的真理，而却美其名曰“创造”，说是什么“真理”，这是胡说八道，与我们所说的标新立异毫无共同之处。
