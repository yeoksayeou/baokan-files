    Speed and Subjective Initiative
    Ruan Yunshun
    Some people still have doubts about "better to be fast than slow." They ask: "Which saying is more proactive, 'The affairs of the future can be done now' or 'Only the affairs of the present can be done now'? Compared to the situation of ordinary workers, Su Guangming can be said to be doing the affairs of the future, not that he 'only did the affairs of the present.' If Su Guangming only did the affairs of the present, what are the other workers doing?"
    Reportedly, the reason for raising this question is that they feel that since there is a difference between the advanced and the ordinary, either one must admit that the advanced are doing the affairs of tomorrow, or one must admit that the ordinary are doing the affairs of yesterday. It can't be said that they are all doing the affairs of today. Then, admitting the former is encouraging, is positive; admitting the latter is discouraging, is negative.
    "Spirits can be boosted but not dampened." But "boosting spirits" is not the same as empty shouting, pointing to facts and truth is not discouraging. Moreover, generally speaking, only ideas that conform to objective truth are the most powerful force to inspire people to move forward.
    Therefore, I believe that, of course, the saying "Only the affairs of the present can be done now" is more proactive. Because first, it completely conforms to objective truth; second, this sentence also contains a more complete meaning. It contains both acknowledging the decisive role of objective conditions and acknowledging people's subjective initiative; it opposes both ideological conservatism and prevents subjective fantasies that disregard actual possibilities; it acknowledges the leading role of the advanced, and prevents their arrogance and stagnation.
    Using concrete facts as examples may make it clearer. Su Guangming completed the first Five-Year Plan in three years and one month; now he has completed the second Five-Year Plan and is starting to step into the third Five-Year Plan. His own 1958 plan was initially to complete twenty months of work in one year; then it was revised to complete twenty-four months in one year; then, it was revised again to complete thirty-six months of work. So people call him "a person who is always ahead of time."
    Compared with the original plan, he has indeed run ahead of the planned time; compared with today's ordinary workers, it can also be said that he is doing things that they will be able to do in the future. But, compared with his own current abilities and the objective possibilities he faces, what about it? Compared with some workers who have stronger production capacity, better production conditions, and therefore larger production volume, what about it? I'm afraid no one dares to say that Su Guangming is already the best in the world today, and no one dares to say that Su Guangming's potential has been fully tapped today? Then, how can it be said that he is doing his future affairs? And why can't we say to him: "You only did the affairs of the present"? Moreover, we can also say: Work hard, you can still do better than this!
    Why can Su Guangming walk ahead of ordinary people? He worked hard for twenty days and finally invented a steel back tile milling oblique fixture. This jumped from doing five pieces a day to doing sixty pieces a day. He studied the water cooling of the tool, and made the work that others had tried for more than half a month without making a single one, and created a jig, which jumped from producing only twenty a day to seventy. Someone asked him, what is the basis and guarantee for this year's advanced plan? He replied, "I plan to do fifteen tool reforms."
    From "thinking hard" to "research" to "creating tools." Su Guangming is precisely like this: constantly improving his understanding of things through practice, and constantly transforming reality (transforming tools) through improved understanding. Thus, a continuous leap-forward development is formed. This "thinking hard" is precisely the expression of subjective initiative. If Su Guangming wants to "always walk ahead of time," he must constantly strive to develop his understanding and liberate his thinking.
    It is precisely because Su Guangming is good at combining practice with "thinking hard" that he has strong ability, we admit that he is walking ahead of ordinary people, doing the affairs of those behind; it is precisely because people's understanding of objective things needs to be constantly developed, and it is never possible to recognize all the possibilities at once, so we do not admit that Su Guangming is doing his future affairs. Objective existence requires Su Guangming to constantly develop his understanding. He has nothing to be proud of and complacent about. Moreover, looking at it more broadly, this applies to everyone.
    This is the greatest positive significance of the saying "Only the affairs of the present can be done now."
    This saying also has a positive significance. Since Su Guangming has proved with facts that the conditions already exist, then other people have no reason not to improve their abilities to use these conditions. So everyone will rise up to catch up, to learn, and thereby raise the production level of ordinary people a step further. This is what workers and peasants call catching up with the advanced. Advanced producers deserve special respect precisely for their leading role in creating conditions, not for what they are "doing the affairs of the future."
    "Doing the affairs of the future," regarded as a method of understanding, is not only not proactive, but also has negative effects. It can make ordinary people say that the person in front is doing the affairs of the future, and we cannot catch up and do not need to catch up. It can make advanced people say to themselves that I am already doing the affairs of the future, how can I move forward any further. In the past, some models stagnated and regressed due to arrogance and complacency, which is probably related to this kind of understanding.

    速度和主观能动性
    阮延顺
    有人对“宜快不宜慢”仍然有怀疑。他们问：“‘现在可以办将来的事’和‘现在只能办现在的事’两种说法，哪一种更积极些呢？同一般工人的情况比起来，苏广铭可以说办将来的事，不能说他‘只办了现在的事’。如果苏广铭只办了现在的事，别的工人又在办什么事呢？”
    据说，所以提出这点疑问，是他觉得，既然存在着先进和一般的不同，要嘛就要承认先进者是在办明天的事，要嘛就要承认一般人是在办昨天的事，总不能说他们都是办的今天的事。那末，承认前者就是鼓气，是积极的；承认后者便是泄气，是消极的。
    “气可鼓而不可泄”。但“鼓气”并不等于虚声呐喊，指以事实真象并不就是泄气。而且，一般的说，只有符合客观真理的思想，才是最有力地鼓舞人们前进的力量。
    因此，我认为，当然还是“现在只能办现在事”的说法更积极。因为第一，它完全符合客观真理；第二，这句话也包含了一个比较完全的意思。它既包含着承认客观条件的决定性作用，又包含着承认人的主观能动性；既反对思想上的墨守陈规，又防止毫不顾及实际可能的主观空想；既承认先进者的带头作用，又防止他们的骄傲和停滞。
    用具体事实作例子也许说得更清楚一些。苏广铭用三年零一个月的时间就完成了第一个五年计划；现在他又完成了第二个五年计划，开始跨进第三个五年计划去了。他自己订的1958年计划，先是一年内完成二十个月的工作；接着就修改成一年完成二十四个月的；接着，又修改成要完成三十六个月的工作量了。所以人们称他是“永远走在时间前面的人。”
    同原有的计划比，他确实跑到计划时间的前边去了；同今天的一般工人比，也可以说他是在办他们将来才能办的事。但是，要同他自己今天所握有的能力，所面临的客观可能性来比，又怎么样呢？同一些生产能力更强，生产条件更好，因而生产量更大的工人来比，更又怎样呢？恐怕谁也不敢说，苏广铭今天已经算是天下第一了吧，更没有人敢说今天苏广铭的潜力已经挖完了吧？那末，怎么能够说他是在作他将来的事呢？又为什么不能对他说：“你只办了现在的事”呢？而且，还可以说：努力吧，你还可能比这办得更好！
    苏广铭为什么能够走在一般人的前边？他苦干二十天，终于发明了一种钢背瓦铣斜卡具。这样就从每天做五块活跳到了每天做六十块活。他研究了放水冷却刀具，把别人试制了半个多月连一个也没有做成的活做成了，又创造了一种胎具，就又从一天只能生产二十个跳到七十个。有人问他，今年的先进计划有什么根据，有什么保证？他回答说“打算搞十五件工具改革。”
    由“苦苦思索”到“研究”到“创造工具”。苏广铭正是这样：不断通过实践提高对事物的认识，又不断通过提高了的认识去变革现实（改造工具）。于是形成了不断飞跃的发展。这里的“苦苦思索”，正是主观能动性的表现。苏广铭要想“永远走在时间的前面”，就要不断努力发展自己的认识解放自己的思想。
    正是由于苏广铭善于结合实践“苦苦思索”，所以他能力强，我们承认他走在了一般人的前头，办着后边人将来的事；正是由于人对客观事物的认识还要不断发展，而且永远也不可能一下把所有的可能性都认识到，所以我们不承认苏广铭办的是他将来的事。客观存在要求苏广铭不断地去发展自己的认识。他一点也不值得骄傲自满。而且，扩大开来看，这是适用于每一个人的。
    这便是，“现在只能办现在事”说法的最大的积极意义。
    这种说法还有一个积极意义。既然苏广铭用事实证明了，条件已经存在，那末，其他的人便没有道理不去提高自己的能力，来使用这些条件。于是大家便要起来赶，起来学从而把一般人的生产水平都提高一步。这就是工人们农民们所说的赶先进。先进生产者值得特别尊敬的，正是他们这种开辟条件的带头作用，而不是什么他们在“办将来的事了”。
    “现在办将来的事”，当作一种认识方法看，不仅不积极，而且，还会有消极作用。它可以使一般的人说，走在前边的那个人是办的将来的事，我们无法赶也不必要赶。它可以使先进的人自己说我已经是在办将来的事了，那里还能再前进。过去有些模范因骄傲自满而停滞发展，而落后，大概和这种认识是不无关系的。
