The “King of Kings” of Rapeseed

On May 6th, a small city on the bank of the Yangtze River – Zhong County, Sichuan – was rocked by an extraordinary happy event. People rushed to crowd around a decorated sedan, parading it through the streets, with clapping and cheering filling the air, and some shops even set off firecrackers to welcome it. Those who didn't know thought the city was welcoming an outstanding bride. When they rushed to the front to take a look, they were all surprised to find that the sedan chair carried a huge rapeseed plant.

Its towering size dwarfed the several “rapeseed kings” previously reported in the newspapers. This rapeseed plant was five feet eight inches tall, its main stem at the base thicker than a fist, with forty-seven large branches, more than seven hundred small branches, and over fifty thousand pods.

This large rapeseed plant has now been sent to the Wanxian Special District Agricultural Exhibition for display. It is placed on a platform in the very center of the economic crops hall, with its top almost touching the ceiling, looking like a small tree. At that time, many high-yielding rapeseed plants from various places were also on display at the exhibition, but this large rapeseed plant from Zhong County stood out like a crane among chickens, becoming the focus of attention for visitors. People called it the "King of Kings" of rapeseed.

This "Rapeseed King" has an interesting story. According to the commentator, it was a Victory rapeseed variety, born on a pile of garbage next to the grain station in Jinji Township, Zhong County, probably accidentally lost by the grain station during the transportation of rapeseed seeds. It sprouted last August and when it grew to about a foot tall, it was discovered by the grain station staff. They carefully took care of it, cultivating it five times, earthing it up five times, and applying sixty jin of human and animal manure as topdressing. Therefore, it grew exceptionally lush, branching and podding from the base, with branches spreading in all directions, requiring four people to join hands to encircle it.

### 油菜“王中之王”

    油菜“王中之王”
    5月6日，扬子江边的一座小城——四川忠县的街头被一件不平凡的喜事轰动了。人们争先恐后地簇拥着一顶彩轿在大街上周游，拍手声、喝采声响成一片，有些商店燃起了爆竹欢迎。不知道的，还以为本城娶来一个多出色的新娘子，抢前一看，没有一个不感到惊奇，原来轿上坐了一株庞大的油菜。
    它那高大的程度，使报纸曾经报道过的几个“油菜王”和它对比之下都大为逊色。这株油菜高五尺八寸，根部主干比拳头还粗，有四十七根大桠枝、七百多根小桠枝、结荚五万多个。
    这株大油菜现在已送到万县专区农业展览会上展出。它被放在经济作物馆正中央的一个台子上，上端快要顶到天花板了，活像一株小树。当时展览会上还陈列着许多株各地送来的丰产油菜，但忠县这株大油菜和它们并列一起却像鹤立鸡群一样，成为参观人们注意的中心，人们称它为油菜“王中之王”。
    这株“油菜大王”有着一段有趣的经历，据解说员介绍，它是胜利油菜种，出生在忠县金鸡乡粮食站屋旁的一个垃圾堆上，可能是粮站在搬运油菜种子时偶然失落的。它在去年8月份出土，长到一尺左右时被粮站工作人员发现，他们精心加以照料，前后中耕五次，培土五次，施追肥人畜粪六十斤。因此它生长得分外茁壮，从根部起就发枝结荚，枝桠向四周扩张，四个人手拉手才能把它围拢。
