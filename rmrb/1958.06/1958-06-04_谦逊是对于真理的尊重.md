　　Humility is Respect for Truth
　　He Ming

　　Humility is a virtue. However, "Where does humility end, and where does immodesty begin?" Is a person who bows and scrapes everywhere called humble? We often say that such a person is "too humble"; this also contains a disapproving meaning. But in the minds of many people, there is always such a vague and general idea: I am not good, you are good; we are not good, they are good—this is "humility." No! This is not humility. This is often hypocrisy or inferiority.

　　The Communist Party wants to transform the world; we say: the socialist camp is good, the imperialist camp is not good—is this immodest? No! This is the truth. Bourgeois scholars are good, and those of us who came from guerrilla warfare are not good—is this humility? No! This is humiliation of the truth. What exactly is humility? Humility is respect for the truth. This also applies to individuals. The collective power, the power of the people is infinitely great, while the individual is insignificant. Boasting and exaggerating, bragging about oneself being capable, this is arrogance. However, when one is in possession of the truth, one must "not give way to any moral duty"; otherwise, one would be humiliating the truth.

　　Respecting the truth and combating fallacies, this is true humility. The fragrant one says it is fragrant, the smelly one says it is smelly, this is truthfulness and also humility. If one is to "humble" oneself towards the stench, and give way, saying "You are fragrant, we are not fragrant," this is called low-level vulgarity. Low-level vulgar people do not want the truth.

　　Marx said it well: "I regard the ridiculous as ridiculous, which is to take a serious attitude towards it; to maintain a humble attitude towards immodesty is also the most serious immodesty of the spirit." I think this truth should be applied to ideological remolding, to "promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology" in our mental state.

### 谦逊是对于真理的尊重

　　谦逊是对于真理的尊重
　　何明
    谦逊是美德。然而，“谦逊在哪里结束，不谦逊又从哪里开始呢？”一个人到处打躬作揖，叫不叫谦逊？对这种人，我们常常说他“太谦了”；这里也包含有不以为然的意思。可是在许多人头脑里却总有这么一个糊涂、笼统的观念：我不行，你行；我们不行，他们行——这就是“谦逊”。不！这不是谦逊。这常常是虚伪，或者是自卑。
    共产党要改造全世界；我们说：社会主义阵营行，帝国主义不行——这是不谦逊吗？不！这是真理。资产阶级学者行，我们打游击出身的人不行——这是谦逊吗？不！这是对真理的屈辱。究竟什么是谦逊？谦逊是对于真理的尊重。对于个人说来也是如此。集体力量、人民群众的力量是伟大无比的，而个人是渺小的。吹牛夸大，自吹自己行，这是傲慢。然而，当自己被真理掌握的时候，却必须“当仁不让”；否则，也就屈辱了真理。
    尊重真理，打击谬论，这才是严肃的谦逊。香者说它香，臭者说它臭，这是真实，也是谦逊。如果对臭气，也要“谦”一下，让一番，“你香，我们不香”，这叫作低级庸俗。低级庸俗者是不要真理的。
    马克思说得好：“我把可笑的事物看成是可笑的，这就是对它采取严肃的态度；对不谦逊仍在采取谦逊的态度，这也就是精神的最严肃的不谦逊。”我看，应该把这条真理运用到思想改造中去，从精神状态上“兴无灭资”。
