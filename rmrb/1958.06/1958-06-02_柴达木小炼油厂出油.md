    The first small refinery built in the Qaidam Basin has been completed in the Youshashan exploration area. On the 25th, it refined gasoline that met quality standards.

    This indigenous refinery has simple equipment and is easy to operate; one worker can manage it. It provides experience in on-site utilization of resources for refining gasoline for the various exploration areas and light drilling teams in Qaidam, and can also cultivate and train refinery workers for Qinghai's local industry.

    The equipment of this refinery is entirely made from old gasoline drums and old steel pipes.

    柴达木小炼油厂出油
    柴达木盆地新办的第一个小型炼油厂在油砂山探区建成，25日炼出了质量合格的汽油。
    这个土法炼油厂设备简单，操作简便，一个工人就可以管理。它为柴达木各个探区及轻便钻井队提供了就地利用资源炼制汽油的经验，并且可以为青海地方工业培养和训练炼油工人。
    这个炼油厂的设备全是利用旧汽油桶和旧钢管做成的。
