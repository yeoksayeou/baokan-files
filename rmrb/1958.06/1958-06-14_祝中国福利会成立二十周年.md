    Congratulating the 20th Anniversary of the Founding of the China Welfare Institute
    Dong Biwu
    On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the founding of the China Welfare Institute, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations.
    Over the past twenty years, under the leadership of Mr. Soong Ching Ling, the China Welfare Institute has made outstanding contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the China Welfare Institute united progressive and peace-loving people internationally, providing moral and material support to the military and civilians in the liberated areas who persisted in fighting the enemy behind the lines. It transported a large amount of medical supplies and other materials to the liberated areas, helping the liberated areas to carry out medical and child care work; it also introduced some international friends who truly sympathized with the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people to work in the liberated areas. Here, we should especially mention Dr. Norman Bethune and Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, who had a great spirit of internationalism, and they dedicated their precious lives to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people.
    The China Welfare Institute, through propaganda work, truthfully reported to foreign countries the heroic and tenacious deeds of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This played a very important role in establishing friendly ties between the people of the liberated areas and progressive people internationally, and in winning international support and sympathy.
    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, during the days when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a full-scale and frantic offensive against the liberated areas, the China Welfare Institute, regardless of the oppression and obstruction of the reactionary government at the time, continued to provide support to the military and civilians in the liberated areas with manpower, materials, and financial resources. It maintained contact with the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, the relief organization of the liberated areas at the time, and through it, it funded the International Peace Hospitals (eight hospitals, forty-two branch hospitals), medical schools (eight schools), nurseries and orphanages (more than a dozen), pharmaceutical factories and other medical and health undertakings and children's welfare, as well as various other social welfare undertakings opened in the liberated areas.
    In order to support the people in the liberated areas, the China Welfare Institute has continuously struggled against reactionary forces at home and abroad, exposing the corruption and brutality of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and refuting and defeating the slanderous remarks from home and abroad that discriminated against and slandered the people of the liberated areas. After the victory of the War of Resistance, it more actively cooperated with the China Liberated Areas Relief Association to carry out a just struggle against the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Kuomintang Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which were manipulated by American imperialism, exposing the criminal facts of imperialism using "relief" to support Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out an anti-people war.
    The China Welfare Institute has a very clear stand. Whether it was in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for national independence, or in the struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and to achieve the complete liberation of the Chinese people, it always stood on the side of the revolutionary Chinese people and made outstanding contributions.
    After the national liberation, the China Welfare Institute is no longer a relief and welfare organization fighting alone in an extremely harsh environment under the heavy oppression of reactionary rule, but a component of the people's mass welfare undertaking in the great socialist construction carried out by the people's government of New China and the people of the whole country with one heart and one mind. With the support of the people's government and people from all walks of life, it has achieved great success in children's culture and maternal and child health care, and many of its works have played a exemplary role in the country. Its international publicity work has reported to the people of the world the leap-forward progress of our country's socialist construction, which has played a positive role in strengthening and expanding the forces of the people of all countries in the world in defending world peace.
    Today, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the China Welfare Institute, the international situation is that "the East wind prevails over the West wind", and the socialist construction of the motherland is leaping forward with unprecedented scale and speed. With a very excited and happy mood, I wish the China Welfare Institute, under this situation which is very beneficial to the world peace movement and our country's socialist cause, can play a greater role and achieve more brilliant achievements in safeguarding world peace and promoting the people's welfare.

    祝中国福利会成立二十周年
    董必武
    中国福利会成立二十周年，谨在这里向它表示衷心的祝贺。
    二十年来，中国福利会在宋庆龄先生的领导下，对中国人民的革命事业是有着卓越的贡献的。
    在抗日战争时期，中国福利会曾经是团结了国际上进步和爱好和平的人士，对我国坚持敌后抗战的解放区军民，给予了道义上和物质上的支援。它曾将大批的医药等物资运送到解放区，帮助了解放区开展医疗和儿童保育工作；它还介绍了一些真正同情中国人民解放事业的国际朋友到解放区工作。这里我们应该特别提到具有伟大国际主义精神的白求恩大夫和柯棣华大夫，他们为中国人民的解放事业献出了自己的宝贵的生命。
    中国福利会，通过宣传工作，把中国人民在中国共产党领导下艰苦卓绝、英勇抗战的事迹，向国外作了真实的报道。这对于解放区的人民同国际上进步人士建立友谊的联系，争取国际上的支援和同情，起了十分重要的作用。
    在抗日战争胜利以后，在国民党反动派对解放区发动全面的、疯狂进攻的日子里，中国福利会仍然不顾当时反动政府的压迫和阻挠，继续以人力、物力和财力，对解放区军民进行支援。它同当时解放区的救济组织——中国解放区救济总会保持联系，并且通过它资助了在解放区开办的国际和平医院（医院八所、分院四十二所）、医科学校（八所）、托儿所和孤儿院（十几所）、制药厂等医药卫生事业和儿童福利以及其他各种社会福利事业。
    中国福利会，为支援解放区人民，曾不断同国内外反动势力进行斗争，揭露国民党反动政府的腐败和残暴，驳斥并击败从国内外发出的歧视和诽谤解放区人民的谰言。在抗战胜利以后，它更积极地配合中国解放区救济总会，同在美国帝国主义操纵下的联合国善后救济总署和国民党行政院善后救济总署进行正义的斗争，揭露帝国主义利用“救济”支援蒋介石进行反人民战争的罪恶事实。
    中国福利会的立场是十分鲜明的。不论是在反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族的独立的斗争中，还是在推翻蒋介石反动统治、求得中国人民的彻底解放的斗争中，它总是站在革命的中国人民的一方面，并且卓越地贡献出自己的一分力量。
    在全国解放以后，中国福利会已经不再是在反动统治重重压迫下，极端恶劣的环境里孤军奋斗的一个救济福利组织，而是新中国人民政府和全国人民同心协力进行的伟大社会主义建设中的人民大众福利事业的一个组成部分。它在人民政府和各界人民的支持下，在儿童文化和妇幼卫生保健方面取得了很大的成就，它的许多工作都在国内起到了模范作用。它的国际宣传工作，向世界各国人民报道了我国社会主义建设事业飞跃前进的情况，这对于加强并扩大世界各国人民保卫世界和平的力量，是起了积极的作用的。
    在我们庆祝中国福利会成立二十周年的今天，国际的局势是“东风压倒西风”，祖国的社会主义建设正以空前的规模和速度向前大跃进，我以十分兴奋和愉快的心情，预祝中国福利会，在这种对世界和平运动和我国社会主义事业十分有利的形势下，能够在保卫世界和平和促进人民福利事业中发挥更大的作用，取得更辉煌的成就。
