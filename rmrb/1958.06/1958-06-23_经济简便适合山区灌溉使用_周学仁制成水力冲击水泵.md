    Economical and Simple, Suitable for Mountain Irrigation
    Zhou Xueren Made Hydraulic Ram Pump
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) According to Tianjin Daily: Zhou Xueren, a worker at the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Xin'an Electric Motor Factory, diligently studied and successfully trial-produced a hydraulic ram pump that utilizes water power. This pump does not require any power equipment, has a simple structure, low cost, and is easy to use, making it particularly suitable for irrigation in mountainous areas.
    This hydraulic ram pump utilizes the "head" of the water to create a natural impact force. Through the mutual action of two valves, water is forced out of the outlet pipe, without the need for power machinery or any fuel. Its structure is also very simple, consisting only of two valves, an air chamber, and two water pipes. This type of pump is very easy to use. As soon as a valve is opened, the pump starts automatically; once started, it can continuously spray water to a height of eight or nine meters day and night. According to the results of tests on a two-inch hydraulic ram pump that has already been trial-produced, it can pump three to four tons of water per hour. This pump also has some shortcomings at present. The main one is that only part of the water passing through the pump can be pumped to a high place for irrigation, and the other part of the water is discharged through a valve, so the drainage power is worse than that of internal combustion water pumps or other water pumps.
    Zhou Xueren is an ordinary worker with only a primary school education. When he accepted the task of trial-producing this pump in March of this year, he had only a simple diagram in an English book for reference. However, Zhou Xueren did not bow his head in the face of difficult tasks. He dared to think and dared to act. Based on his own rich experience, he figured out the principle of using several valves to cooperate with each other to create pressure and pump the water up. He drew up a sketch of the pump, started trial production, and finally succeeded after many tests. During the trial production process, Zhou Xueren received encouragement and support from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the party and administrative leaders of the factory, and also received assistance from engineer Yang Ke.

    经济简便适合山区灌溉使用
    周学仁制成水力冲击水泵
    本报讯  据天津日报消息：天津市公私合营新安电机厂工人周学仁苦钻苦研，试制成功利用水力冲击的水泵。这种水泵不需任何动力设备，结构简单，造价低廉，使用方便，特别适合于山区灌溉使用。
    这台水力冲击水泵利用水的“落差”，造成一股自然的冲击力量，通过两个活门的互相作用，把水从出水管中压出去，既不用动力机械带动，也不需要任何燃料。它的构造也非常简单，全部只有两个活门、一个空气室和两根水管。这种水泵使用十分简便。只要一通活门，水泵就自动地开动；开动以后，可以日夜不停地把水喷到八、九公尺的高处。据现在已试制成的一台二寸水力冲击水泵试验的结果，每小时可以打水三、四吨。这种水泵现在也还有些缺点，主要的是通过水泵的水，只有一部分可以打到高处用作灌溉，另一部分水由一个活门排掉了，所以排水的力量较内燃水泵或其他水泵为差。
    周学仁是一个只有初小文化程度的普通工人。他在今年3月间接受试制这种水泵的任务时，只有登在一本英文书上的一张简图作参考。但是，周学仁没有在困难的任务面前低头。他敢想敢干，根据自己的丰富的经验，想通了利用几个活门互相协作，造成压力，把水压上去的道理。他绘成了水泵的草图，动手试制，经过多次试验，最后获得成功。在试制过程中，周学仁得到了天津市委和工厂党和行政领导上的鼓励支持，并得到了杨恪工程师的帮助。
