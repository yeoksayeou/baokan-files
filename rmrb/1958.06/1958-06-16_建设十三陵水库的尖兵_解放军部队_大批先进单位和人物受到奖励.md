Xinhua News Agency, June 15th – The People's Liberation Army troops, who played a major role in the construction of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir, recently had 160 advanced regimental, battalion, and company-level units and more than 6,400 outstanding individuals rewarded by the general headquarters of the construction site.

More than 40,000 PLA officers and soldiers participating in this reservoir project have consistently undertaken and excellently completed various arduous tasks. A certain engineering unit, from the beginning of the reservoir's construction, braved wind and snow to engage in intense labor. Over the past four months, they have overcome numerous difficulties, blasting more than 200,000 cubic meters of rock alone, and also completed tasks such as excavating spillways, building hydroelectric power stations, and constructing roads and bridges, becoming the vanguard in the construction of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir. Various PLA units responsible for preparing, loading, transporting, unloading materials, and leveling and compacting the earth also launched a revolutionary heroism emulation campaign with a heroic fighting spirit, and a large number of outstanding shock brigades and labor experts emerged. The "Seven Comrades" shock brigade, composed of seven tank soldiers who had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, pioneered a new record on the construction site of 12 cubic meters of earth moved per person per day. However, an "Eight Warriors Assault Group" courageously caught up and created a new record of 19 cubic meters, equivalent to each person moving a train car of earth per day. Li Jingwen, a young soldier from a certain artillery unit, walked 106 li in eight hours and carried 226 loads of earth, creating an astonishing achievement. He was praised as the "Earth-Carrying Hercules" and awarded the honorary title of Third Class Merit.

Among these rewarded units and individuals, there are also many models who boldly innovated technology and created labor tools. Meng Zhaofu, a military vehicle instructor at the Ordnance Technical School, with the support of the Party committee and the help of everyone, created a "small train" of automobile-towed dump trucks, which increased transportation efficiency by six or seven times. Drivers from a certain automobile unit broke through the old rules of automobile driving and, with fully loaded trucks of sand and soil, attached trailers and climbed up the steep slopes to the top of the dam, which was as high as eight or nine stories. When there were no bulldozers on the construction site, officers and soldiers from a certain tank school devised a way to convert captured enemy tanks damaged in the war into highly efficient bulldozers. All these bold inventions and creations have played a significant role in the early completion of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir.

    建设十三陵水库的尖兵——解放军部队
    大批先进单位和人物受到奖励
    新华社15日讯　在十三陵水库建设中起了主力作用的解放军部队，最近有一百六十个团、营、连先进单位和六千四百多个优秀人物，受到工地总指挥部的奖励。
    参加这个水库工程的四万多解放军官兵，一直担负着并出色地完成了各项艰巨的任务。某工兵部队从水库施工开始，就冒着风雪投入紧张的劳动。四个多月来，他们战胜了重重困难，光开山爆破的石头就有二十多万方，另外还完成了开凿溢洪道、修建水电站和铺路架桥等多项任务，成为十三陵水库建设中的尖兵。担负备料、装料、运料、卸料和平土打夯的各兵种部队，也都以英雄的战斗姿态，掀起了革命英雄主义竞赛热潮，涌现出大批的优秀突击队和劳动能手。曾经参加过抗美援朝的七名坦克手组成的“七战友”突击队，首创工地上每人每天挑土十二立方的新纪录。可是，有一个“八勇士强击组”勇猛地赶上去，又创造了十九立方的更新纪录，等于每人每天挑一火车皮的土。某炮兵部队的青年战士栗经文，八小时走路一百零六华里，挑土二百二十六担，创造了惊人的成绩。他被赞誉为“挑土大力士”，获得三等功臣的光荣称号。
    在这些受奖的单位和人物中，还有许多是大胆革新技术和创造劳动工具的模范。军械技术学校的军车教员孟昭孚，在党委支持和大家帮助下，创造了汽车牵引斗车的“小火车”，使运输效率提高了六、七倍。某汽车部队的驾驶员们，突破汽车行驶的老规程，把满载着砂土的大卡车再挂上拖斗，沿着陡坡一直爬上八九层楼高的大坝顶。某坦克学校的官兵们还在工地上没有推土机的时候，想办法把在战争中缴获敌人的破坦克，改造成了效率很高的推土机。所有这些大胆的发明创造，都对十三陵水库的提前建成起着重大作用。
