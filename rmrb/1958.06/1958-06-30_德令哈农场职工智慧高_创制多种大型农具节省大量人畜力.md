    Delingha Farm Workers Display Great Ingenuity
    Creating Various Large Farm Tools to Save Labor and Animal Power
    Workers at the Delingha Farm, located at the eastern end of the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province, have utilized collective wisdom to create and modify over twenty types of large farm tools for tasks ranging from plowing, soil crushing, fertilizer crushing, seeding, ridging, and loosening soil, to ditch digging and transportation.
    The plow-harrow they created added two small disc harrows to the rear right side of the plow. When plowing, the soil is turned over and then crushed by the harrow discs, saving both human and animal power, and the quality is better than plowing first and then harrowing. The lightweight double-furrow plow uses a wooden plow frame, reducing steel consumption by ninety-three kilograms, making it easy to operate and requiring only one mule to pull it. The soil crusher they created is thirty to sixty times more efficient than manual labor, and it is also conducive to moisture retention and the root development of crops. The modified sixteen-row horse-drawn seeder only requires one horse to pull it, whereas the original horse-drawn seeder required three horses. The strip fertilizer applicator is even more ingenious, as it can sow seeds and apply fertilizer at the same time, combining two processes into one. This year, the farm expanded its potato planting area, and they specially created a three-ridge potato ditcher, which is twice as efficient as the old-fashioned walking plow for ditching. In order to implement small-furrow irrigation, they created a ridger that can be pulled by one horse, which is sixty to seventy times more efficient than manual ridging. After sowing, in order to make it easier for seedlings to emerge, they created a soil loosener, which is forty-five times more efficient than manual soil loosening. In addition, they also created a tractor-drawn land leveler and ditch digger for leveling ridges and digging ditches, and modified human and animal-powered heavy-duty roller carts for transportation.
    Because the workers of this farm have created and modified various large farm tools, it is estimated that they can save one-third of human and animal power, and have also accelerated this year's cultivation speed and improved the quality of field management. As a result, this year's wheat, highland barley, peas, potatoes, etc., are growing particularly well.

    德令哈农场职工智慧高
    创制多种大型农具节省大量人畜力
    青海省柴达木盆地东端的德令哈农场职工，发挥集体智慧，从耕地、碎土、碎肥、播种、扶垅、松土一直到开渠、运输等，创造和改制了二十多种大型农具。
    他们创制的带耙犁，在犁的后右侧增加了两片小圆盘耙，犁地时土壤翻转后即被耙片切碎，既节省人、畜力，质量也比先翻后耙好。轻便双铧犁，是用木材做的犁架，减少了九十三公斤钢材，操作轻便，只用一头骡子即可拉动。他们创制的碎土器，用起来比人工提高效率三十倍到六十倍，而且有利于保墒和作物的根部发育。他们改制的十六行马拉播种机，只要一匹马就可以拉动，原来的马拉播种机需要三匹马拉。条施肥料机搞得更妙，它可以一面播种一面施肥，两道工序并成了一道。这个农场今年扩大了马铃薯的种植面积，他们特创制了一种三垅马铃薯开沟器，效率比老式步犁开沟提高两倍。为了实行小畦灌溉，他们创制了扶垅器，一匹马就可以拉动，比人工扶垅提高效率六、七十倍。播种后为了使幼苗容易出土，他们创制了松土器，比人工松土效率提高四十五倍。此外，他们还创制了平垅、开渠两用的拖拉平垅开沟器，改制了运输用的人、畜重力滚车等。
    这个场的职工们由于创制和改制了多种大型农具，据计算可以节省三分之一人力和畜力，并且加快了今年的耕作速度，提高了田间管理的质量，因而今年的小麦、青稞、豌豆、马铃薯等长得特别好。
