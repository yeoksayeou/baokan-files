Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 16th: In order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province have launched a production campaign centered on summer planting after completing the summer harvest.

This year, the progress of summer planting in Anhui Province is faster than in previous years. Statistics up to the 11th show that more than 28 million mu of middle-season rice, soybeans, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, sesame, etc., have been planted throughout the province. It is estimated that this year's summer planting work can be completed seven days ahead of schedule compared to previous years.

This year, due to the early completion of the summer harvest in Anhui Province, especially the application of manure before the wheat harvest, the summer planting work in various places is not only progressing rapidly, but also the crops that have been sown generally meet the quality requirements of deep plowing, close planting, and sufficient fertilizer.

Because this year's summer harvest work ended early, leaders at all levels have taken the initiative and can concentrate their energy on leading the summer planting. For example, after Wu'nan County's 530,000 laborers completed the summer harvest six days ahead of schedule, in addition to assigning a portion to continue wheat threshing work, the vast majority have been put into drought resistance and summer planting work. Currently, 125,000 mu of summer rice and more than 40,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been planted, and more than 400,000 mu of sweet potato ridges have been prepared. In this way, they can strive to finish summer planting early and create favorable conditions for a bumper autumn harvest.

    一早百早　事事主动
    安徽将提前七天完成夏种
    据新华社合肥16日电　为了争取秋季大丰收，安徽省各地农业社在夏收完成后，已开展了以夏种为中心的生产运动。
    今年，安徽省夏种的进度比往年快，到11日统计，全省已栽种中稻、大豆、玉米、甘薯、花生、芝麻等二千八百多万亩，预计今年夏种工作可以比往年提前七天完成。
    今年，安徽省由于夏收提前完成，特别是在麦收前即送了粪，因此，各地夏种工作不仅进度快，而且已播作物一般都符合深耕、密植、肥足等质量要求。
    由于今年提前结束夏收工作，各级领导因此争取了主动，可以集中精力领导夏种。如镳南县五十三万个劳动力在提前六天结束夏收以后，除抽出一部分继续进行小麦脱粒工作外，其余绝大部分已投入抗旱夏种工作，现在已经栽好夏稻十二万五千亩、甘薯四万多亩，并冲好甘薯垄子四十多万亩。这样，就可以争取提前结束夏种，为秋季大丰收创造有利的条件。
