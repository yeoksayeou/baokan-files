　　Jottings
    They Have a Homeland
    In recent days, De Gaulle has delivered successive speeches in Algeria, repeatedly declaring his intention to annex Algeria. To deceive the Algerian people, this newly-emerged French Prime Minister even "cried and laughed" during his speeches, pretending to be compassionate, saying that he would give the Algerian people "a homeland they do not yet have."
    This statement is very strange, as if a "homeland" can be given as a gift. The Algerian people have expressed in the past, and still express now, that they have their own homeland. To fight for the independence and freedom of their homeland and resist French colonial aggression, the Algerian people have waged a heroic and long-term struggle. The reality is: hundreds of thousands of French colonial troops cannot force the Algerian people to submit; similarly, De Gaulle's two crocodile tears and a lie will not help. The statement issued by the Algerian National Liberation Front on the 5th is a powerful response to De Gaulle's arrogant ambition.
    Scared Out of Their Wits
    Milton Eisenhower, the brother of US President Dwight Eisenhower, is the President's special advisor on Latin American issues. He was originally scheduled to visit Latin America at the end of June. However, the US State Department recently issued a statement suddenly, announcing the postponement of his visit.
    A reporter asked US State Department spokesman White: Is Milton Eisenhower's change of plans related to Nixon's "experience"? White replied: "I have no way of knowing that."
    It is easy to understand why White dared not give a definite answer; but why did he dare not give a negative answer either? It seems that Nixon's "experience" of being beaten in Latin America has indeed scared a small group of colonialists in Washington out of their wits. Just thinking about it makes them feel lingering fear, and Milton Eisenhower certainly dares not take the risk of going there again immediately.

　　札记
    他们有祖国
    最近几天，戴高乐在阿尔及利亚接连发表演说，一再宣称要把阿尔及利亚吞并。为了蒙蔽阿尔及利亚人民，这个新登场的法国总理在演说时居然“又哭又笑”，还装作一副悲天悯人的样子，说什么要给予阿尔及利亚人民“至今他们还没有的祖国”。
    这种说法很奇怪，好像“祖国”还是能赠予似的。阿尔及利亚人民以前表示过，现在也仍然表示，他们有自己的祖国。为了争取祖国的独立和自由、反抗法国的殖民侵略，阿尔及利亚人民进行了英勇和长期的斗争。现实是：数十万法国殖民军不能迫使阿尔及利亚人民屈服；同样地，戴高乐这两滴鳄鱼眼泪和一句谎言也无济于事。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线5日发表的声明，就是对戴高乐的狂妄野心有力的答复。
    吓坏了
    美国总统艾森豪威尔的弟弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔，是总统关于拉丁美洲问题的特别顾问。他原定6月底到拉丁美洲访问。可是，最近美国国务院突然发表声明，宣布推迟他的访问日期。
    有一个记者问美国国务院发言人怀特：密尔顿·艾森豪威尔改变计划，是否同尼克松的“经历”有关呢？怀特回答说：“我没有办法知道这一点。”
    怀特不敢作肯定的回答，这是容易理解的；但是他为什么又不敢作否定的回答呢？看来，尼克松在拉丁美洲挨打的“经历”，的确把华盛顿的一小群殖民主义者吓坏了。一想起这件事，难免心有余悸，密尔顿·艾森豪威尔当然不敢马上再去冒风险了。
