Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 7th: The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) victoriously closed on the afternoon of the 7th.

At the closing session, the results of the election of the Party Central Committee were announced. A total of eighty-nine Central Committee members, forty-eight alternate Central Committee members, and nineteen members of the Central Auditing Commission were elected.

Following this, Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the BCP Central Committee, delivered the closing speech at the congress.

He said that this congress would be recorded in the history of the Party and the Bulgarian people as the congress representing the victory of socialism in our country. There is no doubt that the Seventh Congress will have great historical significance for the development of the Party and the country.

Zhivkov then said that our congress brilliantly demonstrated the Bulgarian Communist Party's infinite loyalty to the great, invincible, ever-living, and developing doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. The congress showed that our Party sacredly protects and will forever protect the revolutionary traditions bequeathed to us by Blagoev and Dimitrov—the tradition of uncompromising struggle against opportunism and reformism.

Zhivkov said to the representatives of the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties attending the Seventh Congress, you will forever have the Bulgarian Communist Party as a loyal contingent of the world communist and workers' movement, which will never betray communism at any time, under any circumstances, or for any purpose.

Zhivkov concluded by saying that the resolutions of the congress are a magnificent program for Bulgaria's leap forward along the road to socialism. He emphasized that we are deeply convinced that, with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union and in cooperation with other socialist countries, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, will surely build a socialist society victoriously in the near future and bravely march towards communism.

After Zhivkov delivered the closing speech, the congress closed amidst the strains of "The Internationale" and the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!"

    大会显示了对马列主义的无限忠诚
    新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会在7日下午胜利闭幕。
    闭幕会上宣布了党中央机构选举结果，共选出了八十九名中央委员，四十八名候补中央委员，十九名中央检查委员会委员。
    接着，保共中央第一书记日夫科夫同志在大会上致了闭幕词。
    他说，这次大会将作为我国社会主义胜利的代表大会而载入党和保加利亚人民的史册。毫无疑问，第七次代表大会将对于党和国家的发展具有重大的历史意义。
    日夫科夫接着说，我们的代表大会光辉地显示了保加利亚共产党对于伟大的、战无不胜的、永远活生生的和发展着的马克思列宁主义学说的无限忠诚。代表大会表明，我们党神圣地保护着并且将永远地保护布拉戈耶夫和季米特洛夫所遗留给我们的革命传统——毫不妥协地同机会主义和改良主义进行斗争的传统。
    日夫科夫向出席第七次代表大会的兄弟共产党和工人党代表说，你们将永远有保加利亚共产党这样一支世界共产主义运动和工人运动的忠诚的队伍，它不论在任何时候，不论在任何情况下，也不论为了任何目的都决不背叛共产主义。
    日夫科夫最后说，代表大会的决议是保加利亚沿着社会主义道路跃进的宏伟纲领。他强调说，我们深信，在伟大的苏联的兄弟援助下，在同其他社会主义国家互相合作下，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下一定能在不远的将来胜利地建成社会主义社会并且勇敢地向共产主义迈进。
    日夫科夫致闭幕词以后，代表大会在“国际歌”和“全世界无产者联合起来！”的口号声中闭幕。
