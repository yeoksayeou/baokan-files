    Wang Shuzhen Oversees 11,600 Spindles
    Chang Qingfu Oversees 284 Looms
    (Our dispatch) Since the promulgation of the General Line, the Tianjin State-owned No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory has rapidly launched a wave of technical innovation. On June 19, the factory universally changed its labor organization, simplifying operations. At the same time, it adopted two innovative measures to automate cleaning work. On the night shift of June 20, fine spinning worker Wang Shuzhen created a national record of overseeing 11,600 spindles.
    On the same day, night shift weaving worker Chang Qingfu also created a national record of overseeing 284 looms. While the number of machines overseen has increased dramatically, the factory has maintained 100% first-class yarn quality, and the first-class rate of cloth coming off the looms is still 99.71%. The zero-defect distribution rate is also maintained at 41.43%.
