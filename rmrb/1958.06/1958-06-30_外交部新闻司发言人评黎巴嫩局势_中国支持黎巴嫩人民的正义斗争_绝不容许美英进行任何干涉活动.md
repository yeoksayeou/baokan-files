Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The spokesperson for the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China commented on the Lebanese situation on the 29th: "The Chinese people are very concerned about the development of the situation in Lebanon. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Lebanese people and all Arab peoples against imperialist and colonialist oppression. The Chinese government firmly believes that the Lebanese people have the sacred and inviolable right to solve their own problems in their own way. Any attempt by any imperialist country to interfere in Lebanon's internal struggle under any pretext is absolutely unacceptable.

However, the governments of the United States and Britain, especially the United States government, have been blatantly interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs from the very beginning. They have not only transported large quantities of munitions and military personnel through certain Baghdad Pact member states to help one side of the internal struggle in Lebanon against the other, but they have also mobilized a large number of warships and military forces to the eastern Mediterranean and Cyprus to carry out armed intimidation against the Lebanese people. Now, they are using the United Nations to infiltrate Lebanon and carry out increasingly blatant interference. The people of the world still have vivid memories of the United States' crime of using the United Nations to invade Korea. The United States' attempt to use the name of the United Nations to cover up its interference activities cannot deceive the Lebanese people and the people of Arab countries.

It must be solemnly pointed out that the interference of the United States government in Lebanon's internal affairs, no matter what pretext it adopts or what name it uses, is unacceptable. It is not only a provocation to the Lebanese people and all Arab peoples, but also a provocation to the cause of world peace and a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese government and people cannot but express serious concern about this situation. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression in Lebanon and the Arab region, they will inevitably be resolutely countered by peace-loving people all over the world. We firmly believe that as long as the Lebanese people unite as one and as long as all Arab peoples unite as one, then they will be fully capable of crushing any imperialist aggression against the Arab people with the firm support of the people of the world."

    外交部新闻司发言人评黎巴嫩局势
    中国支持黎巴嫩人民的正义斗争
    绝不容许美英进行任何干涉活动
    新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人29日评黎巴嫩局势：“中国人民非常关心黎巴嫩局势的发展。中国政府和中国人民一向同情并且支持黎巴嫩人民和全体阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的正义斗争。中国政府坚决认为黎巴嫩人民具有神圣不可侵犯的权利，用自己的办法解决自己的问题，任何帝国主义国家企图利用这样或那样的借口对黎巴嫩的内部斗争进行任何干涉，都是绝对不能被容许的。
    但是，美英两国政府，特别是美国政府，从一开始就对黎巴嫩的内部事务进行了横蛮的干涉。他们不但通过某些巴格达条约成员国运送了大批的军火和军事人员去帮助黎巴嫩内部斗争的一方反对另一方，而且还向东地中海和塞浦路斯一带调集了大批的军舰和军事部队，向黎巴嫩人民进行武装恫吓。现在，他们正在利用联合国打进黎巴嫩，进行越来越露骨的干涉，世界人民对于美国利用联合国侵略朝鲜的罪行记忆犹新。美国企图用联合国的名义来掩盖他们的干涉活动是欺骗不了黎巴嫩人民和阿拉伯各国人民的。
    必须严正指出，美国政府对黎巴嫩内部事务所进行的干涉，不管是采取什么借口和使用什么名义，都是不能容许的。它不但是对黎巴嫩人民和全体阿拉伯人民的挑衅，而且也是对世界和平事业的挑衅，是对全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅。中国政府和人民不能不对这局势表示严重的关切。如果帝国主义者竟胆敢在黎巴嫩和阿拉伯地区发动侵略战争，就必将受到全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决反击。我们坚决相信，只要黎巴嫩人民团结一致，只要全体阿拉伯人民团结一致，那末，他们就完全有可能在全世界人民的坚决支持下粉碎帝国主义对阿拉伯人民的任何进攻。”
