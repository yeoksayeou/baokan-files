Good Experience
Introduction to Breeding and Seed Selection Work of Yuetan Agricultural Cooperative

(Our report) The 1,953 mu of wheat in Yuetan Agricultural Cooperative, Yanshi County, Henan Province, are growing with multiple heads, uniform ears, large ears, and full grains this year. According to the current situation, the average yield per mu of all wheat fields is about 600 to 700 jin. All the commune members are joyfully and actively preparing to welcome the harvest.

The reason why the wheat in Yuetan Cooperative is growing particularly well this year is that, in addition to the three fundamental agricultural construction works of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement being done well, the widespread use of improved varieties is a very important reason. According to field surveys, the use of improved varieties increased production by more than 30% compared to local general seeds.

Yuetan Cooperative pays great attention to seed work. Since the introduction of the Bima No. 1 improved variety in 1952, it has been carefully selected annually, ear by ear. In 1955, a seed plot was established to specialize in seed breeding. Establishing a seed plot has many benefits, not only significantly improving the quality of seeds, but also saving seed selection time and reducing trouble. According to their actual experiments, under the same other conditions, the seed yield selected from the seed plot is about 90 jin higher than that selected from the large fields. Although the Bima No. 1 improved variety introduced by the cooperative in 1952 has been around for six or seven years, the quality of this variety has not only not degraded, but has also improved. A dou of Bima No. 1 wheat weighs one and a half to two jin more than the same variety of wheat in other places, the color has become better, and the gluten is greater.

The breeding and seed selection experience accumulated by Yuetan Cooperative over the years mainly includes the following four points: First, establish a seed selection organization to strengthen the leadership of seed selection work. The cooperative establishes a seed selection committee, and the team establishes a seed selection professional team. The second is to do a good job in publicity, clarify seed selection requirements, and achieve six requirements during seed selection (want large ears, want main ears, want uniform growth, want consistent maturity, want full grains, want tight grains); seven don'ts (don't want field heads, don't want field edges, don't want lodging, don't want diseases and insect pests, don't want too high, don't want too low, don't want small ears); four specials (special varieties, special plots, special people to select, special field to thresh); three singles (single harvest, single threshing, single storage) and two prohibitions (no mixing, no mildew). The third is to do a good job in seed treatment. Before sowing, all improved varieties are tested for germination, exposed to the sun, wind-selected, and large field seeds are selected by floating in clay water. In thin areas, sodium bicarbonate is used to soak seeds or ammonium sulfate is mixed for sowing, and all seeds are mixed with Ceresan. The fourth is to establish a seed plot and cultivate excellent varieties.

Now they are preparing to welcome the selection and retention of seeds for autumn crops and the evaluation of improved varieties, and have launched a mass "double hundred" seed selection campaign: select a hundred kinds of varieties, select wheat ears with a hundred grains of seeds (thirty-seven have been selected).

    岳滩农业社育种选种工作介绍
    本报讯　河南偃师县岳滩农业社今年一千九百五十三亩小麦块块生长得多头、穗齐、穗大、籽粒饱满。据目前情况看，全部麦田平均亩产约在六百到七百斤之间。全体社员都在喜气洋洋，积极准备迎接丰收。
    岳滩社小麦今年所以生长得特别好，除水利、积肥和改良土壤三项根本的农业建设工作作得好以外，普遍采用良种是个很主要的原因。据实地调查，因采用良种就比当地一般种子增产30％以上。
    岳滩社非常注意种子工作，自1952年引进碧蚂一号良种后，年年精选、穗选；1955年更建立起种子地，专门进行种子的培育工作。建立种子地好处很多，不只是显著提高了种子的质量，还节省了选种时间，减少了麻烦。根据他们实际试验，在其他条件相同的情况下，种子地穗选的种子比在大田选的种子产量高九十斤左右；该社从1952年引入的碧蚂一号良种，虽然已达六、七年之久，到现在这个品种的质量，不但没有退化，而且有所提高。一斗碧蚂一号的小麦重量比其他地方同品种小麦差一斤半到二斤，色泽变得更好，面筋更大。
    岳滩社多年积累起来的育种选种经验，主要有下面四条：第一建立选种组织，加强选种工作的领导，社建选种委员会，队建选种专业队。第二是作好宣传工作，明确选种要求，选种时要作到六要（要大穗、要主穗、要生长整齐、要成熟一致、要籽粒饱满、要籽粒紧密）；七不要（地头不要、地边不要、倒伏不要、病虫害不要、过高不要、过低不要、小穗不要）；四专（专品种、专地块、专人选、专场打）；三单（单收、单打、单保存）和二不准（不准混杂、不准霉烂）。第三是作好种子的处理工作。在播种前将所有良种进行发芽试验、暴晒，用风选，用胶泥水漂选大田种子。对脊薄地区用小苏打浸种或用硫铵混播，并全部用赛力散拌种。第四就是建立种子地，加工培育优良品种。
    现在他们正在着手迎接秋季作物的选种、留种和评选良种等工作，已开展起群众性的“双百”选种运动：选百样品种，选百粒籽的麦穗（现在已选三十七个）。
