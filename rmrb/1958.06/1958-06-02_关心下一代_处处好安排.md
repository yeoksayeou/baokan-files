　　Caring for the Next Generation: Good Arrangements Everywhere
　　The First Generation of Little Citizens in the Forest
　　More than seven thousand first-generation little citizens born in the primeval forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains are growing up healthily. They are all children of the workers of various ethnic groups who have come to the primeval forest area in recent years to develop forest resources, including Han, Mongolian, Korean, Daur, and Oroqen nationalities.
　　With the rapid development of timber production in the Greater Khingan Mountains, more than 10,000 households of forestry workers have settled in the forest area in recent years. They are distributed in towns and worker villages in forest farms. In these towns and larger worker villages, there are more than 100 hospitals, workshop health clinics, maternal and child health stations, and midwifery stations, forming a maternal and child health network. In addition to full-time obstetricians, midwives, and maternal and child health workers, seventy-four mass midwives have also been trained. They widely educate pregnant women about maternal and child health knowledge and new methods of childcare and conduct prenatal examinations and postpartum visits. Therefore, infantile tetanus and other diseases have been basically eliminated. According to statistics in 1957, the infant survival rate reached 99.2%.

　　Local Museum
　　The "Local Museum" established by Baodian Township Primary School in Changzi County, Shanxi Province, has become a new garden for the moral growth of young children in "loving the motherland, loving their hometown, and loving labor."
　　This "Local Museum" was established in the summer of 1957. The general instructor of the Young Pioneers of Baodian Township Primary School and all the Young Pioneers personally renovated an old temple hall as the museum site and personally collected and displayed a lot of information and objects reflecting the local agricultural production and natural historical changes. Among them are photos, charts, and paper-cuts reflecting the local rural collectivization and mechanization, more than fifty paintings depicting the achievements of agricultural construction such as granular fertilizer plants, highways, canals, and reservoirs, specimens made by the children themselves from dozens of insects, aquatic animals, minerals, and soils, and a collection of ancient cultural relics and local specialties such as hemp and medicinal materials. There are also many easy-to-understand books, newspapers, periodicals, comic strips, etc. for children to read in the museum. The museum also has a small zoo, which houses many rabbits, pigeons, pigs, and small birds. The "Local Museum" is welcomed and loved by the children, and they come to their own museum in their spare time. (Xinhua News Agency)
　　Boat Dwellers' Kindergarten
　　Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, has a paradise for the children of boat dwellers—the Fifth Wooden Boat Cooperative Kindergarten. In the past, when the children of boat dwellers could walk, their parents began to worry, because every flood season, children would drown every year. But in the past, the boat people lived in poverty, so they had to place their hopes on the "Bodhisattva," and they had to sacrifice to the "River God" for their children, no matter how poor they were.
　　After the establishment of the Fifth Wooden Boat Cooperative in 1956, the boat dwellers built a kindergarten themselves, which took in more than forty children aged three to seven. This year, the leaders of the cooperative changed the past day care to full boarding. At the same time, an empty house was vacated in the cooperative as a children's dormitory. And a children's canteen was established.
　　Since the kindergarten was established, the safety of the boat dwellers' children has been guaranteed. In the past two years, no children have drowned. The children have also become very polite and clean.
　　China Children's Publishing House
　　Publishes a Large Number of Children's Books
　　China Children's Publishing House has published a batch of excellent works. Among them, the more excellent fairy tales and novels are: Zhang Tianyi's "The Secret of the Magic Gourd," Yuan Jing's "The Story of the Little Black Horse," Zhou Libo et al.'s "Lameizi," etc. Poetry includes Liang Shangquan's "Singing from Beijing to the Frontier," Jin Jin's "The Drummer of the Squad," Hu Jingfang's "Song of Camping," etc. Travel notes and essays include Zeng Ke's "Remotely Sending to the Children of the Motherland," Liang Xuezheng's "The Grassland by the Ili River," etc. In addition, the script includes Li Shanda's "Little Bucket," folk tales include Li Nanli's "Baji Lake Extermination of Demons," Wang Dapeng and Lin Yinwu's "Sacred Fire on Temple Lake," Qin Zhen's "Crab King," etc.
　　China Children's Publishing House also organized publicity and evaluation work for children's books. They also selected eighty-one books published in recent years and compiled them into a book catalog for children to refer to.
　　Young Audience Loves Puppet Shows
　　China Puppet Troupe Performs on the Streets
　　The China Puppet Troupe has recently performed frequently for many young audiences in Beijing.
　　In the past, some staff members of the China Puppet Troupe were unwilling to serve children and were unwilling to perform small plays. They only performed in the Dongsi Theater, which specializes in puppet shows. Recently, they performed many shows for children at the Danggui Stage in Tianqiao. When they performed on the streets, there were few staff members and the props were simple. Often the head of the troupe would beat the gong, the director would carry the stage, and the car driver would also participate in the work. Residents warmly welcomed them to perform on the streets, and some even poured tea for them to drink.
　　Recently, the troupe is rehearsing more programs suitable for street performances, and the rehearsal time has been greatly accelerated. For example, only half of the puppet play "Dragon" was rehearsed last year, and now the other half of the play "Dragon" has been rehearsed in only eight and a half days. They only spent two days to produce five programs for young children.

　　关心下一代  处处好安排
　　森林里的第一代小公民
    诞生在大兴安岭原始林区里的七千多名第一代小公民正在健康地成长。他们都是近几年来到原始林区开发森林资源的各族职工的子弟，其中有汉、蒙古、朝鲜、达呼尔和鄂温克等民族。
    随着大兴安岭木材生产的迅速发展，几年来来到林区安家落户的森工系统职工有一万多户。他们分布在林区各城镇和林场上的工人村里。在这些城镇和较大的工人村里，设有医院、车间卫生所、妇幼保健站和接生站一百多处，形成了妇幼保健网。除了专职产科大夫、助产士、妇幼保健员以外，还训练了七十四名群众接生员。她们向产妇广泛地进行妇幼保健知识和新法育儿的教育，并作到产前检查和产后访视。因此，现已基本上消灭了婴儿破伤风等疾病，据1957年统计，婴儿成活率达到了99.2％。

    乡土博物馆
    山西长子县鲍店乡小学建立的“乡土博物馆”，成为少年儿童们“爱祖国、爱家乡、爱劳动”新的品德成长的园地。
    这所“乡土博物馆”，是在1957年夏天建立的。鲍店乡小学少先队总辅导员和全体少先队员们亲自动手整修了一座破旧的古庙大殿作为馆址，又亲自收集并陈列出许多反映当地农业生产自然历史面貌变化的资料和实物。其中有反映当地农村集体化、机械化的照片、图表和剪纸，有描绘农业建设成就的颗粒肥料厂、公路、水渠和水库等五十多幅绘画，有用孩子们自己采集来的数十种昆虫、水产动物、矿石、土壤等制成的标本，有搜集的一部分古代文物和当地盛产的麻和药材等土特产品。在馆内还有许多通俗易懂的书籍、报刊、连环画等供孩子们阅读。博物馆还附设有小型动物园，园里养着许多兔子、鸽子、猪和小鸟等。“乡土博物馆”受到了孩子们的欢迎和爱戴，每逢课余时间，他们就来到自己的博物馆里。　（新华社）
    船家幼儿园
    江苏常州有一所水上儿女的乐园——第五木船合作社幼儿园。过去，船家的孩子到了会走路时，父母就开始担心，因为一到洪水季节，年年都有小孩落水淹死。但过去船民生活贫困，只好把希望寄托在“菩萨”身上，再穷也得给孩子祭
  “河神”。
    1956年第五木船合作社成立以后，船民们自己动手办了一所幼儿园，收了四十多个三周岁到七周岁的儿童。今年，合作社的领导上将过去的日托改成了全托。同时在合作社内腾出了一间空房子，作为儿童宿舍。并成立了一个幼儿食堂。
    自从办了幼儿园，船家孩子的安全就有了保障，两年多来没有一个孩子落水淹死，孩子们也变得很有礼貌，很爱清洁。
　　中国少年儿童出版社
    出版大量儿童读物
    中国少年儿童出版社出版一批优秀作品。其中较优秀的童话和小说有：张天翼的“宝葫芦的秘密”，袁静的“小黑马的故事”，周立波等著的“腊妹子”等。诗歌有梁上泉的“从北京唱到边疆”，金近的“中队的鼓手”。胡景芳的“露营之歌”等。游记和散文有曾克的“遥寄祖国的孩子们”，梁学政的“伊犁河边的草原”等。此外，剧本有李山大的“小桶”，民间传说有李南力的“巴吉湖灭妖记”，王大鹏、林荫梧的“庙子湖上的神火”，秦榛的“蟹大王”等。
    中国少年儿童出版社还组织了对儿童读物的宣传和评介工作。他们还选择了近年来出版的八十一种读物，编成图书目录，给孩子们参考。
    小观众喜爱木偶戏
　　中国木偶剧团到街头演出
    中国木偶剧团最近经常为北京市的许多小观众演出。
    过去，中国木偶剧团的一些工作人员不愿为儿童服务，不愿演小型剧。他们只在专门演木偶戏的东四剧场演出。最近他们到天桥的丹桂舞台为儿童演了许多场。他们在街头演出时，工作人员很少，道具简单，常常是团长敲锣，导演扛戏台，汽车司机也参加工作。居民们十分欢迎他们到街头演出，有的还倒茶水给他们喝。
    最近这个剧团正在排练更多适合街头演出的节目，排练的时间也大大加快。如木偶剧“龙”去年只排了一半，现在只用八个半天就排好了“龙”的另半个戏；他们只用两天时间就排出了五个给幼儿看的节目。
