    Does Work-Study Affect Education Quality?
    Facts from the Building Materials Industry School Prove Skeptics Wrong
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Lin Mo reports: After the Shenyang Building Materials Industry School launched its work-study program, significant changes occurred in the thinking of teachers and students. People who originally thought work-study would affect teaching quality and had many doubts about it also changed their views through practice. Facts speak louder than words. Teachers lecturing on building machinery equipment had to retrofit a crane in production. However, without a large crane, they couldn't dismantle the crane. Under the guidance of veteran workers, they quickly dismantled it. They manufactured a machine for producing glass wool, but after many tests, they couldn't smoothly extract the glass fibers. In the end, a veteran worker solved the problem. They encountered similar situations almost every day in production. Teachers could lecture eloquently in class about the structure of a machine or the process of a certain production, but in production, lacking practical knowledge and without the help of workers, they found it difficult to proceed. In the past, they viewed practice as simple and book theory as profound; through production, they realized that practice was not simple, and veteran workers possessed a wealth of experience not found in any book. Only then did they deeply realize that they were at most semi-intellectuals; theoretical knowledge without practice was very hollow. Some teachers combined knowledge gained from practical production with book theory in their teaching, making the content rich and lively, which students loved to listen to. Many students participating in production in the workshop mentioned that in the past, when they learned工艺课 (gong yi ke - industrial arts) in class, they only had a vague concept in their minds. To pass the exam, they memorized everything by rote, and it was easy to forget afterward. Now, doing it themselves, they quickly became familiar with the production process of the product, and the knowledge they learned was solid, much better than simply learning in the classroom. More importantly, teachers and students, through work-study activities, transformed their thinking and strengthened their labor perspective. Students who went to factories had practical experiences with the excellent qualities of the working class through contact with master workers. Intellectuals can talk a lot of high-sounding principles, but their actions often become disconnected. The master workers in the factory, however, demonstrated a sense of the overall picture, responsibility, care for state property, and selflessness in their daily labor. Some master workers were so focused on production that they forgot to eat and sleep. The master workers in the foundry workshop would rather burn their feet than allow the castings to be damaged. Some students used to be undisciplined, but when they got to the factory, the master workers told them, "You are a worker now, and you should observe discipline. You can't be casual." One student found a crack in the part he forged and hammered it a few times, trying to cover it up. When the master worker found out, he told him, "If this part is assembled into a machine and sent to another factory, the state will suffer losses, and it will also ruin our reputation." Some students, when they got good tools, wouldn't use them themselves and wouldn't let others use them either. The master worker told them, "This belongs to the collective, and anyone can use it." In the past, students wasted materials casually when doing experiments; now, in the factory, they have developed the habit of cherishing state property, and even small scraps on the ground are picked up. One night it rained, and students Yu Shuyi and Miao Chunrong thought of a bag of lime placed outside the workshop, and they quickly ran to collect it. Such a thing would not have happened in the past.
    Work-study has brought a new atmosphere of love for labor to the school. Students are particularly enthusiastic when they see work, feel fond of the products they make, and always want to go to the factory on Sundays. In the past, some people liked to talk about food, clothing, and enjoyment; now, labor has become a frequent topic of conversation. In the past, some people were afraid of getting dirty when working; now, they feel very close to wearing greasy clothes. When some female students went to the brick factory to participate in production, they still wore scarves around their necks; some were afraid of getting their clothes dirty, and they specially made shoulder pads, aprons, sleeves, and shoe covers. Now these squeamish habits have been abandoned. In the past, when students went to the glass factory for internships, they had to be picked up and dropped off by car, and they were unwilling to even ride in trucks, wanting to ride in covered wagons; now, they walk more than twenty li back and forth every day, taking their lunch boxes early in the morning and leaving happily. Work-study can not only transform thinking and learn knowledge, but also strengthen the physique. Of the nine students who produced in the foundry workshop, three originally had stomach problems and one suffered from neurasthenia and insomnia. Now these diseases are all gone; in more than two months of labor, each person gained an average of four jin in weight. Among the students in the whole school, generally, the heavier the labor, the more weight they gained. According to a partial survey, it is roughly: first-year students gained 1-2 jin in weight; second-year students gained 3-4 jin; third-year students gained 4-6 jin.

    勤工俭学会影响教育质量吗？
    建筑材料工业学校的事实证明怀疑论者毫无根据
    本报讯  记者林沫报道：沈阳建筑材料工业学校在开展勤工俭学活动后，师生的思想起了显著的变化。原来认为勤工俭学会影响教学质量，对这事有许多怀疑的人，也在实践中改变了自己的看法。事实胜于雄辩。该校讲授建筑机械装备的教师，要在生产中改装一台起重机，但是离开了大吊车，就无法来拆卸这架起重机，在老工人的指导下却很快地卸开了。他们制造了一架生产玻璃棉的机器，经过多次试验，总是不能顺利地抽出玻璃纤维。最后，也是请一位老工人来解决了问题。他们在生产中几乎每天遇到类似这样的事情。教师们对一台机器的构造、某种生产的工艺过程，可以在课堂上讲的头头是道，但是一到生产中，缺少实际知识，没有工人的帮助，却是步步难行。过去他们把实际看得很简单，把书本理论看得十分奥妙；通过生产，他们才知道，实际并不简单，在老工人手上，有任何书本都找不到的丰富经验。这时他们才深深体会到：自己顶多不过是个半知识分子；只有理论而缺乏实践，这种理论知识是十分空洞的。有些教师把从生产实践中所获得的知识结合书本理论进行教课，内容丰富生动，学生也爱听了。许多在车间参加生产的同学谈到，过去他们在课堂上学工艺课，脑子里只有一个模糊的概念，为了应付考试，就一条条死背，而过后也很容易忘掉。现在亲自来作，很快地熟悉了产品的生产过程，学到的知识很牢固，比单纯课堂学习好多了。更重要的是，师生们通过勤工俭学活动，改造了思想，加强了劳动观点。下工厂的同学，在同老师傅的接触中，对工人阶级的优良品质有了实际的体会。知识分子会讲许多大道理，但往往和自己的行动脱节。工厂的老师傅却是在日常劳动中，处处表现了整体观念、认真负责、爱护国家财产和大公无私的精神。有的老师傅一心搞生产，废寝忘食。铸工车间的老师傅，宁肯烫了自己的脚，也不肯让铸件受到损害。有的同学过去自由散漫惯了，到了工厂，老师傅就告诉他：“你现在是一个工人了，应该守纪律，随随便便可不行。”有一个同学发现自己锻造的零件有裂纹，就在上边用锤子敲打几下，想蒙混过去。老师傅知道了，就告诉他：“用这零件装配成机器，送到别的工厂，一来国家受到损失，二来也毁坏了我们的名誉。”有的同学拿到好的工具，自己不用了，也不愿让别人使。老师傅就告诉他：“这是集体的东西，谁都可以用。”同学们过去作试验，随便浪费材料；如今在工厂里养成了爱护国家财产的习惯，地下有一点料头都要拣起来。有一天夜里下雨了，于树义和苗春荣同学想到车间外边还放着一袋白灰，两人就赶紧跑去收拾起来。这样的事，在过去是不会有的。
    勤工俭学给学校里带来了热爱劳动的新风气。同学们见了活特别亲热，对自己制造的产品感到喜爱，星期天也总愿到工厂去转转。过去有些人爱谈吃穿享受；现在劳动成了人们经常谈论的话题。过去有的人干起活来怕脏；现在穿起油腻的衣服也感到很亲切。有的女同学到红砖厂参加生产的时候，脖子上还围着纱巾；有的怕弄脏衣服，特别做了垫肩、围腰、袖套、鞋盖，现在这些娇气都被打掉了。过去同学到玻璃厂实习，来回要汽车接送，甚至连卡车也不愿坐，而要坐篷车；现在是每天来回步行二十多里，一大早就夹上饭盒高高兴兴地走了。勤工俭学不但可以改造思想，学习知识，同时也锻炼了体格。在铸工车间生产的九个同学，原来三个人有胃病，一个人神经衰弱闹失眠，现在这些病都好了；在两个多月的劳动中，平均每人增加体重四市斤。在全校同学中，一般劳动越重，体重增加越多。根据部分调查，大致是：一年级同学体重增加1—2市斤；二年级同学增加3—4市斤；三年级同学增加4—6市斤。
