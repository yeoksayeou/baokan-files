　　Using Real People and Events to Promote the General Line
    The Practices of Laibin Town and Taiping Township in Guangxi are Lively and Vivid
    (Our Nanning dispatch, 8th) How can the publicity of the General Line be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household in rural areas? Laibin Town in Laibin County and Taiping Township in Yishan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, provide experience. They seize real people and events for specific publicity, and use pictures for comparison, which are two easy-to-understand, lively and vivid publicity methods.
    The common feature of these two publicity methods is to carry out publicity through the farmers' own experience and familiar vivid examples. What does it mean to go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Laibin Town does not talk about general principles, but cites real people and events from various co-ops and production teams to publicize in a simple and understandable way. For example, since the spring plowing, the cadres and the masses of Gu San Agricultural Cooperative have been energetic and confident, striving for the first in everything. As a result, this cooperative has been at the forefront of the county in sowing and transplanting, ranks first in the town in pig raising, and has formed a climax in learning culture; Liang Jingzhang, the captain of the 20th production team of Pingxi Cooperative, is full of energy, does what he says, and perseveres to the end. As a result, this team has overfulfilled all tasks, and all the early rice seedlings are of the first class. These people and events are examples of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. These examples are familiar to everyone, and using them to explain and promote the General Line is easy to understand and leaves a particularly deep impression. After the farmers understood the spirit of the General Line, they all automatically checked the production of their own cooperative and team. The director of Si Guan Cooperative checked and said: "We always have an idea in our minds: rice is not as good as Gu San Cooperative, but sugarcane is much better than Chang Mei Cooperative! It is this idea that has dragged us back. This is not striving for the top, it is not even good enough for the middle!" The branch secretary of Chang Mei Cooperative checked and said: "The town committee assigned us the task of planting 1,500 mu of spring corn, but we emphasized the difficulties and only assigned 1,200 mu to the team. This kind of layer-by-layer stripping is simply content to be downstream!" After such comparative inspection and criticism, the cadres and the masses said, "The General Line is like an X-ray, illuminating our thinking!" "The General Line is a beacon, guiding us to build socialism faster!"
    The second characteristic of the publicity methods of Laibin Town and Taiping Township is that they seize the fundamental issue of the General Line—the issue of construction speed. Is it greater, faster, better, and more economical? Or is it less, slower, worse, and more costly? The photo exhibition in Taiping Township uses facts for comparison to help farmers draw conclusions on this issue. The exhibition has a total of eighty-six pictures, the main content of which is a comparison of the three years from 1956 to 1958. After the cooperativization in 1956, a production upsurge was set off, and all cooperatives achieved bumper harvests; in 1957, an evil wind came, and monsters and ghosts came out of their holes, and many cooperatives reduced production; in 1958, the enthusiasm soared, superstitions were broken, and the leap forward was followed by another leap forward. There are also introductions to the township's long-term plan, the great technological revolution with energy and drilling spirit, and heroic model figures. These pictures are "people attract people, events attract events, simple and easy to understand," and are deeply welcomed by cadres and the masses. After seeing the pictures, the cadres of Da Qiao Cooperative naturally recalled the past and compared it with today. They said: Last year, due to serious right-leaning conservative thinking, the cooperative only harvested more than 1.3 million catties of grain, a decrease of more than 400,000 catties compared with 1956; this year, the thinking has been improved, and the enthusiasm has been boosted. The area planted with early rice alone is 4,300 mu, an increase of nearly one time compared with last year, and an increase in production is certain. Lan Bingxing, the production captain of Jian An Cooperative, said: "Last year, the cadres were scolded and could not hold their heads up; this year, they are upright and strong, and work vigorously at the forefront."
    The development of production in the past three years, the upsurge—the downturn—the greater upsurge, this saddle-shaped development and its reasons, have profoundly educated the cadres and the masses, enabling them to learn lessons from this clear comparison. They resolutely advocate going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    With the in-depth publicity of the General Line, a new situation has emerged in which everyone strives to be upstream and everything catches up with the advanced. Si Lan Cooperative in Taiping Township encountered a severe drought this spring, and the cadres' and the masses' confidence in increasing production wavered. However, when they saw on the pictures that the steel production team of Gao Che Cooperative still overfulfilled the early rice planting plan under the severe drought situation, they immediately organized the accumulation of fertilizer and increased the application of fertilizer to make up for the losses caused by the drought. Eighty-three cadres from Lingshan Cooperative visited the pictures and immediately formulated specific measures to compete with the heavens and fight with nature for grain, and learned from the steel production team in this regard. The various agricultural cooperatives in Laibin Town have outstandingly persisted in the fight against drought for five months. Ninety-five of the town's ninety-eight production teams are red flag teams. Under the encouragement of the General Line, they told the Laibin Town Committee of the Communist Party of China: "We guarantee that the red flag will never fade." They have promoted the drought resistance to protect seedlings and the perennial water conservancy to a climax. The town has also found 136 underground rivers, underground seepage and other water sources, which can not only ensure the harvest of early rice, but even if it does not rain for a year, the planting area of late rice can still be expanded by 3,000 mu compared with this spring's plan.

　　用真人真事对比宣传总路线
    广西来宾镇和太平乡的做法生动活泼
    本报南宁8日电　在农村如何使总路线的宣传深入人心，家喻户晓？广西僮族自治区来宾县的来宾镇和宜山县的太平乡提供了经验。他们抓住真人真事进行具体宣传，利用图片进行对比，就是两种通俗易懂、生动活泼的宣传方式。
    这两种宣传方式的共同特点，是通过农民的切身经验和所熟悉的生动事例进行宣传。什么叫做鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省？来宾镇不是讲一般的大道理，而是举出各社各生产队的真人真事深入浅出地来宣传。如古三农业社从春耕以来，干部群众劲头大，信心足，干什么都要争第一，结果这个社播种、插秧都走在全县的最前列，养猪在全镇居第一，学文化形成了高潮；平西社第二十生产队队长梁景章浑身是劲，说干就干，一干到底，结果这个队样样任务超额完成，早稻禾苗全部都是第一类。像这些人这些事就是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省。这些事例为大家所熟悉，用它来解释和宣传总路线通俗易懂，给人的印象也特别深刻。当农民领会了总路线的精神以后，都自动地对照检查本社本队的生产，泗贯社主任检查说：“我们思想上总存在一个想法：水稻比不上古三社，可是甘蔗比长梅社强得多啊！就是这个思想拖了我们后腿。这哪里是争上游，中游也不够哩！”长梅社的支部书记检查说：“镇委分给我们春玉米任务一千五百亩，我们强调困难，分给队只有一千二百亩。这样层层剥皮，简直是甘居下游！”经过这样对照检查批判，干部、群众都说“总路线像X光，把我们思想照亮了！”“总路线是明灯，指引我们更快地建成社会主义！”
    来宾镇和太平乡宣传方式的第二个特点，是抓住了总路线的根本问题——建设速度问题。是多快好省呢？还是少慢差费呢？太平乡的图片展览，用摆事实进行对比，帮助农民在这个问题上得出了结论。他们展出的图片共有八十六幅，其中主要的内容是1956年到1958年三年的对比。1956年合作化后掀起了生产高潮，社社丰产；1957年来了一阵歪风，牛鬼蛇神出洞，不少社减产；1958年干劲冲天，破除迷信，跃进再跃进。还有本乡的远景规划、干劲加钻劲技术大革命及英雄模范人物的介绍等内容。这些图片“以人引人、以事引事、简单易懂”，深受干部和群众的欢迎。看了图片的大桥社的干部很自然地回忆起过去并和今天对比。他们说：去年本社由于有严重的右倾保守思想，只收粮食一百三十多万斤，比1956年减产四十多万斤；今年思想提高一步，鼓足了干劲，光早稻就插了四千三百亩，比去年增加了将近一倍，增产是肯定的了。建安社的生产队长蓝炳星说：“去年干部挨骂，抬不起头来；今年是挺胸硬腰雄赳赳，工作起劲走前头。”
    三年来生产发展的情况，高潮——低潮——更大的高潮，这个马鞍形的发展及其原因，深刻地教育了干部和群众，使他们从这个鲜明的对比中得到了教训，他们坚决主张要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省的建设社会主义。
    随着总路线的深入宣传，出现了人人争上游，事事赶先进的新局面。太平乡思榄社今春遇到严重旱灾，干部和群众的增产信心发生动摇，可是当他们在图片上看到了高车社钢铁生产队在苦旱情况下，仍超额完成了早稻种植计划后，马上组织积肥，增施肥料，弥补受旱损失。灵山社八十三名干部参观图片，立即订出具体措施，要与天公比高低，向自然争粮食，并以此向钢铁生产队学习。来宾镇各农业社五个月来出色地坚持了抗旱斗争，全镇九十八个生产队，就有九十五个是红旗队，在总路线的鼓舞下，他们向中共来宾镇委表示：“保证红旗永不退色”。他们已把抗旱保苗和常年修水利推向了高潮，全镇又找出了地下河、地下闷水等水源一百三十六处，不仅可以使早稻保收，即使一年不下雨，晚稻种植面积仍然可以比今春计划扩大三千亩。
