Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 16th: Representatives from all walks of life in Romania held a grand gathering in the city of Galați on the 15th to give a rousing send-off to the Soviet troops stationed in Romania, who were scheduled to withdraw on the same day.

The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Romania was based on a proposal by the Soviet government, which was approved by the Romanian government and the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states. Romanian Party and government leaders, including Chivu Stoica, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and Apostol Gheorghe, attended the farewell meeting. Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Romanian territory is a concrete measure by the Soviet Union and the socialist camp to ease international tensions.

On that day, Romanian Party and government leaders, military representatives, and thousands of working people from the city of Galați went to the station to bid farewell to the Soviet troops. They presented flowers and gifts to the Soviet troops and wished them a safe journey.

On the 15th, farewell meetings for the Soviet troops were also held in other cities in Romania.

    据新华社布加勒斯特16日电  罗马尼亚各界代表15日在加拉齐城举行隆重集会，欢送在当天就要撤离罗马尼亚的苏联驻军。
    苏联驻军是根据苏联政府的建议撤出罗马尼亚的。这个建议获得了罗马尼亚政府的同意和华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议的批准。罗马尼亚党政领导人基伏·斯托伊卡、若扎、阿波斯托尔等参加了这个欢送会。罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡在会上讲了话。他指出，苏军撤离罗马尼亚领土是苏联和社会主义阵营争取缓和国际紧张局势的一个具体措施。
    这一天到车站欢送苏联驻军的有罗马尼亚党政领导人、军队代表和加拉齐城数千名劳动人民。他们向苏联驻军献花、赠送礼品，并祝福他们一路平安。
    15日在罗马尼亚的其他城市也举行了对苏军的欢送会。
