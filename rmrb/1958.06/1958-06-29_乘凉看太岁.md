    Watching Jupiter and Saturn While Enjoying the Cool Air
    Bian Depei
    Every night, when people are enjoying the cool air outdoors, the two largest planets in the solar system—Jupiter and Saturn—also happen to appear in the sky for people to admire.

    After dusk, there is a particularly bright star in the sky to the southwest, and that is Jupiter. Jupiter is also known as "Tai Sui," and it is the big brother of the planets. In terms of volume, one Jupiter is equivalent to 1,300 Earths!

    The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 150 million kilometers, while Jupiter is more than 777 million kilometers away from the Sun. Objects that revolve around planets are called satellites. Earth has only one satellite, the Moon, while Jupiter has twelve satellites. It is conceivable that if someone lived on Jupiter, the sky they would see must be very beautiful and lively: several moons appearing in the sky at the same time, some crescent moons, some full moons. Unfortunately, the surface temperature of Jupiter is very low, below minus 100 degrees Celsius, and there is no life on it. But as long as we have a simple telescope, we can see Jupiter's four largest moons, which rapidly change their positions around Jupiter.

    Jupiter rotates once every ten Earth hours or less. Its rapid rotation causes it to become a very flattened planet due to centrifugal force.

    Just as Jupiter is shining in the sky, Saturn is gradually rising from the southeast. In that part of the sky, Saturn is brighter than other stars and is easily recognizable. Before midnight, Saturn rises higher and higher until the east turns white the next day, and the sun is about to rise, when it disappears from the west.

    Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system, more than 1.4 billion kilometers away from the sun. Its volume is second only to Jupiter, and it is 760 times larger than Earth, but its mass is only 95 times that of Earth. Therefore, its density is very small, equivalent to 12% of Earth's, with a specific gravity of 0.7 that of water. If Saturn were placed in a pool of water large enough to hold it, it would float on the water.

    Saturn has rings that no other planet has. The rings are divided into three layers, all composed of meteor bodies revolving around Saturn. In small telescopes of 20x magnification or more, Saturn is truly the most beautiful and attractive celestial body.

    乘凉看太岁
    卞德培
    每晚，当人们在户外纳凉的时候，太阳系中的两颗最大行星——木星和土星也刚好出现在天空中，任人欣赏。
    傍晚以后，正南偏西的天空中，有一颗特别明亮的星星，那就是木星。木星别名太岁，它是行星中的老大哥，以体积来说，一个木星抵得上一千三百个地球呢！
    地球和太阳的平均距离约为一亿五千万公里，而木星离太阳达七亿七千七百多万公里。绕着行星转的叫卫星，地球只有一个卫星，就是月亮，而木星却有十二个卫星。可以设想，假若有人住在木星上，他们所看到的天空一定是非常美丽和热闹的：几个月亮同时出现在天上，有的是蛾眉月，有的是满月。可惜木星的表面温度很低，在摄氏零下一百度以下，它上面并没有生命存在。但是我们只要有一架简单的望远镜，就可以看到木星的四个最大的月亮，它们在木星周围迅速地变换着位置。
    只有地球时间的十小时还不到，木星就自转一周。它的这样快速的旋转使得它因为离心力的关系成为一个很扁的星球。
    正当木星在空中闪烁的时候，土星也逐渐从东南方升起来。在那部分天空中，土星比其他星星都亮，很容易辨认。在午夜以前，土星越升越高，直到第二天东方发白，太阳快升起来时，它才从西方隐没下去。
    土星是太阳系中第二大行星，距离太阳在十四亿公里以上。它的体积仅次于木星，而比地球大七百六十倍，但它的质量却只等于地球的九十五倍，因此，它的密度很小，相当于地球的12％，水的比重的零点七，如果把土星放在一处足够容纳它的水池中的话，它就会浮游在水上。
    土星有着其他行星所没有的光环。环分三层，都是由环绕着土星旋转的陨星体组成的。在二十倍以上的小望远镜中，土星实在是最美丽和最吸引人的天体。
