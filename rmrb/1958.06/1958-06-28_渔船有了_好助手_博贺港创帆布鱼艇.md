    Fishing Boats Get a "Good Helper"
    Bohe Port Creates Canvas Fishing Boats
    Recently, a versatile canvas fishing boat appeared on the sea off Bohe Port, Guangdong Province. This was created jointly by the Party Secretary of Bohe Town, fishery technicians, and members of the Bohe Fishery Cooperative at a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" held in late last month.
    The method of making this fishing boat is to oil the canvas and shape it into a fishing boat form. Another wooden frame is made. When in use, the canvas is nailed to the wooden frame with screws, and this becomes a fishing boat. This boat is a good helper for seine boats when they go to sea. When the seine boat takes it, it can be lowered into the sea for fishing when there is no wind, and retracted when there is wind. It can also be used to load fresh water when it rains, which is convenient for extending the seine boat's time at sea. Because this boat is light and labor-saving, a pair of seine boats can take ten to fifteen boats to sea, so the fish catch also increases significantly. This boat is not only fast and durable, but also cheap. It only costs 80 yuan to make one, which is about 50 yuan less than buying a wooden sampan. The cooperative plans to install 300 of these in this quarter and is currently rushing to manufacture them.

### 渔船有了“好助手”  博贺港创帆布鱼艇

    渔船有了“好助手”
    博贺港创帆布鱼艇
    广东省博贺港海面上，最近出现了一种用帆布做的万能钓鱼艇。这是博贺镇的党委书记、渔业技术干部和博贺渔业社的社员们在上月下旬的一次“诸葛亮会”上共同研究创制出来的。
    这种钓鱼艇的做法，是将帆布上油后制成钓鱼艇形式，另做一副木架，使用时就用螺丝钉将帆布钉在木架上，这就变成了钓鱼艇。这种艇是拖风船出海时的好助手。拖风船带上它，无风就用它放下海钓鱼，有风就收起；下雨时还可以用它来装载淡水，便于延长拖风船的出海时间。由于这种艇轻便省力，一对拖风船可以带十只到十五只出海，因此，鱼获量也随着大量增加。这种艇不但行驶快捷、耐用，而且价钱便宜，做一只只需八十元，比买一只木舢板要少花五十元左右。这个社准备在这个季度内安装三百只，目前正在赶制中。
