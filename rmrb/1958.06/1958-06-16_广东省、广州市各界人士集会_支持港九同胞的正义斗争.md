Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 15th: People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a meeting on the 14th to strongly protest the unreasonable behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong in prohibiting Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong from hanging the national flag and singing the national anthem. They also expressed their firm support for the serious protest lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs with Britain regarding this matter.

Xie Yonghui, Standing Committee Member of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, in his speech, represented all the workers in the province in strongly protesting the unreasonable behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong in infringing upon the patriotic rights of Chinese residents in Hong Kong.

Xu Chongqing, Chairman of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Education Trade Union, who has been engaged in education work for nearly 40 years, pointed out that citizens of any country have the right to hang the flag of their own country, which is a matter of course and does not require any "explanation." It is the British authorities in Hong Kong who need to provide an explanation. May I ask what reason they have to interfere with and prohibit Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon from hanging the Chinese national flag and singing the Chinese national anthem?

Mai Jiabing, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou City Student Union, said that the Hong Kong authorities' interference with Hong Kong Chinese residents hanging the national flag and singing the national anthem is a great insult to the people of our country. All students in Guangzhou City express their firm protest.

Representatives from units such as the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Women's Federation, the Guangzhou City Federation of Trade Unions, the Guangzhou City Education Trade Union, the Guangzhou City Democratic Youth Federation, and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League also expressed their firm support at the meeting for the just struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots to safeguard their sacred patriotic rights.
