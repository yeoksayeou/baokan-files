    Breaking the Mystique of Science
    Zhou Jianren

  　People live to eat, drink, live, and wear clothes; obtaining these things is never completely smooth, without difficulties, and without struggle. Humanity has gained much knowledge from this struggle. This kind of knowledge, based on experience, gradually becomes richer through repeated modifications and additions. But on the other hand, without a doubt, in the old society, due to the underdevelopment of production technology and science, knowledge was not yet scientific, and some knowledge would be accompanied by superstition.

    Since the division of mental and physical labor, under the situation of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," mental labor occupies a dominant position, possessing superior conditions for academics. In other words, mental laborers also dominated academics, that is, occupied culture and possessed science.

    But even under these circumstances, with a little observation, it is easy to see that knowledge is the common wealth of the working people. Just a brief conversation with workers, peasants, or fishermen will reveal that laborers are very knowledgeable in aspects related to life. Although superior conditions are occupied by mental laborers, creation and invention often come from workers or people of low social status. This kind of situation also exists in other countries. For example, Engels once said that the Jenny spinning machine invented in England was manufactured by a worker named James Hargreaves in North Lancashire in 1764. Soon after, a water-powered spinning machine appeared, invented by a barber named Charlie Ackley in the same area in 1767.

    Old China circulated a legend that completely violated the facts, unreasonably attributing the inventions and creations that were clearly made by the masses to "extraordinary people" or "gods." For example, clothes were clearly made by the masses because of need. Marx had already said that people were wearing clothes long before there were specialized seamstresses. However, China has inherited a superstition from ancient times, saying that clothes were made by the Yellow Emperor. What medicine can cure what disease was clearly tested by countless people, over a long period of time, during which there must have been many painful experiences, such as being poisoned or killed by eating poisonous herbs, and so on. However, legends say that it was invented by Shennong. He tasted hundreds of herbs to distinguish their medicinal properties, and so on. It's truly absurd.

    Believing legends that do not conform to the facts is superstition. Although this kind of superstition has decreased in recent years, if the remaining things are not completely eliminated, it will reappear in disguise. For example, some Chinese people are superstitious about foreign countries, even saying that the moon is rounder in foreign countries than in China. Another example is the superstition that people must have talent to learn things well and invent things, and so on. These new superstitions can be said to be the incarnation of old superstitions.

    We must thoroughly break all superstitions and sweep them away completely. Make everyone believe that the masses have knowledge, wisdom, and power. Science is nothing more than systematized knowledge. And by examining the history of the development of science, it has developed along with the needs of social production. Engels tells us: "The sequence of development of the various departments of natural science must be studied. First, astronomy—nomadic and agricultural peoples absolutely need it simply to determine the seasons. Astronomy can only develop with the help of mathematics. Therefore, the study of mathematics is also necessary..." (Engels, "Dialectics of Nature," p. 149)

    From this, it can be seen that science is not mysterious. It is a systematic knowledge, and tracing its history, it has developed along with the needs of social production. In today's construction of socialism, the need for science is unprecedented. As long as we break all superstitions that bind and hinder the development of science, and first break the mystique of science, while liberating science from the hands of "privileged" people, from the unreachable "throne," down to the ranks of the people, there is no doubt that science will definitely be greatly developed in China soon.

    The science developed in this way is the science of the people, born from the ranks of the working people and serving the working people. Of course, we will never be satisfied with the sorting and organization of existing knowledge to systematize it. We must also strive to learn while doing, constantly and diligently, and delve deeply. Solve unsolved problems and discover and invent things that predecessors have not seen or known.

    The masses are a collective of individuals, and to unleash the power of the masses, individual efforts are still needed. However, the experts cultivated from the efforts of the broad masses, no matter how specialized they are, are still members of the masses, part of the collective; they will no longer generate centrifugal force and create themselves into special people or special "classes."

    The new experts cultivated in this way, who are also making their own efforts, are engaged in socialist construction, while theoretically seeking truth. He clearly knows that truth is completely knowable, but at the same time not completely knowable, that is, not exhaustively knowable, because the objective world is developing. This understanding is very important and can make a person, even if he is a "learned scholar," remain humble. Does saying that "learning has no limit" make people passive? I don't think so, because society is progressing and inspiring people's hearts.

    打破科学的神秘性
    周建人
  　人活着总是要吃食，喝水，居住，穿衣服的；要求获得这些东西决不是十分顺利，毫无困难，不需要斗争的。人类从这斗争里获得了许多知识。这等知识，凭借经验，经过多次的修改和增加，渐渐丰富起来。但别一方面，没有疑义，在旧社会里，由于生产技术和科学不发达，知识还没有科学化，有些知识里会附带着迷信。
    自从脑力劳动与体力劳动分工以后，在“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的情况下，脑力劳动居于统治地位，对于学术，据有了优越的条件。换一句话，脑力劳动者也统治了学术，即占据了文化，占有了科学。
    但即便是在这种情况之下，只要稍微加以观察，也容易看出：知识本是劳动人民的公共财富。只要略与工人、农民或渔民谈话，便知道劳动者对于生活有关方面的知识是非常丰富的。优越条件虽为脑力劳动者所占据，但创造与发明常常出于工人或社会地位低的人们。别国里也有这种情形，例如恩格斯曾说过：英国发明的珍妮纺纱机是北郎卡郡名叫詹姆斯·哈格里沃斯的工人，在1764年制造出来的。不久有水力纺纱机出现，是同地方一个叫查理·阿克来的理发师在1767年发明的。
    旧中国流传过一种与事实完全违反的传说，把分明是群众的发明与创造，极不合理地归功于“异人”或“神”。例如衣服，分明是人民群众因为需要而制造出来的。马克思早就说过，没有专门的缝纫师以前，人们早已穿衣服了。然而中国却自古流传下来的迷信，说衣裳是轩辕黄帝制造出来的。什么药可治什么病，分明是由无数人，经过长久的岁月，试验出来的，其间一定还经过许多苦痛的经验，如吃了毒草毒坏或毒死人，等等。然而传说上却说是神农氏发明的。他尝百草，辨药性，云云。真是荒唐之至了。
    信不合事实的传说，就是迷信。这种迷信近若干年来虽然已减少了。但要是残余的东西不去尽，它还会化了装出现的。如中国有些人的迷信外国，甚至说外国月亮比中国的圆好。又如迷信人须有天才才能学得精通，发明东西，等等。这些新迷信可以说是旧迷信的化身。
    我们必须彻底地打破一切迷信，把它扫除净尽。使大家相信：群众有知识，有智慧，有力量的。科学非他，只是系统化了的知识。并且查考科学的发展史，它是跟社会生产的需要发展起来的。恩格斯告诉我们：“必须研究自然科学各个部门的顺序的发展。首先是天文学——单单为了要定节季，游牧民族和农业民族就绝对需要它。天文学只有借助于数学才能发展。因此也就不得不从事于数学的研究……”（恩格斯“自然辩证法”第149页）
    由此可知，科学并不神秘。它是成系统的知识，追查历史，它是跟社会的生产需要发展起来的。在建设社会主义的今日，对于科学的需要是空前的，只要打破一切束缚与阻碍科学发展的迷信。首先打破科学的神秘性。同时把科学从“特权”者的手里解放出来，从高不可攀的“宝座”上，降到人民群众的队伍里来，毫无疑问，不久，科学在中国是肯定能大大发展起来的。
    这样发展起来的科学是人民的科学。生自劳动人民的队伍为劳动人民服务。当然，我们绝不会满足于既有知识的整理与组织，使之系统化。还要努力地、不断地边做边学，竭力钻研，深入又深入。解决未解决的问题，发见与发明前人所未见未知的东西。
    群众是个人的集体，要发挥群众的力量，仍需各人的努力。但从广大群众努力里培养出来的专家，无论专到如何深，他仍是群众的一员，集体的一部分；再也不会发生离心力，把自己造成特殊的人或特殊的“阶级”的。
    这样培养出来的，同时又是自己努力出来的新专家，从事于社会主义建设，同时理论方面是探求真理。他清楚地知道真理是完全可以认识的，同时又不是可以完全认识的，即认识不完的，因为客观世界在发展。这一了解，非常要紧，能使其人虽是“硕学”，但仍然谦虚。说明“学无止境”，会不会使人消极的呢？我想不会的，因为社会在进步，鼓舞着人心。
