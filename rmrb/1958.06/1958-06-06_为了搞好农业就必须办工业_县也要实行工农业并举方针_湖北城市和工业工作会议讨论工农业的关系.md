Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial urban and industrial work conference from May 26th to 31st. Based on the spirit of the general line of socialist construction, the conference started with emancipating the mind and made detailed discussions on issues such as the relationship between industry and agriculture, the assessment of the Rectification Campaign, and the relationship between the Rectification and the technical revolution and the cultural revolution.

At this meeting, some comrades proposed that the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture is the policy of the whole country and the whole province, but is it applicable to counties? The implication was whether implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture in counties would hinder the counties from focusing their main efforts on agricultural production. The meeting analyzed the industrial and agricultural development of the country and the province, especially the widespread need for agricultural tool improvements, irrigation and cultivation machinery, and chemical fertilizers due to the great leap forward in agriculture. It was believed that it is precisely to do a good job in agriculture that industry must be run, and that counties are a decisive link in realizing the Party and the whole people running industry. If the county party committees do not grasp industry, and the peasants, who constitute the vast majority of the people, do not run industry, the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry cannot be realized, and industry cannot be run well. The current issue is how the prefectural and county party committees can focus on agricultural production to run industry and other work well, so that the prefectural and county party committees can "grasp agriculture with the right hand and industry with the left." The meeting believed that this requires summarizing and promoting good experiences from various places, and initially decided that the first secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees must take charge of running industry, study industrial issues several times a year or a season, and the secretaries and committee members in charge of industry should devote their main energy and main time to studying the situation and problems of industry.

The meeting also analyzed the situation of the Rectification Campaign in the province. The vast majority of enterprises have seen a new stage of great changes in leadership style, great improvement in mass awareness, and a great leap forward in production and construction. The meeting believed that the current problem is not overestimating the victory of the Rectification, but underestimating it. If the unprecedented great victory of the Rectification Campaign is underestimated, socialism cannot be built with full confidence. At the same time, the meeting also believed that the Rectification Campaign has not yet achieved a complete victory, and the development of the movement is uneven. Therefore, the meeting decided that in June and July, the Rectification must be thoroughly carried out, so that the leadership style can be fundamentally changed, the rightists can be completely isolated, the road to capitalism can be blocked, and a complete victory in the Rectification can be striven for.

　　为了搞好农业就必须办工业  县也要实行工农业并举方针
    湖北城市和工业工作会议讨论工农业的关系
    据新华社武汉讯　中共湖北省委5月26日到31日召开全省城市和工业工作会议，根据社会主义建设总路线的精神，从解放思想入手，就工农业的关系、对整风运动的估计、整风和技术革命、文化革命的关系等问题作了详细讨论。
    在这次会上，有的同志提出工农业并举的方针是全国、全省的方针，但是否适用于县？意思指如果县也实行工农业并举的方针，是否会妨碍县里将主要力量放在农业生产上。会议分析了全国和本省工农业发展的情况，特别是农业大跃进普遍需要农具改良、灌溉和耕作机械、化学肥料等情况，认为正是为了搞好农业，就必须办工业，并且认为县是实现全党全民办工业的决定的一环。如果县委不抓工业，占人民最大多数的农民不办工业，就不能实现全党全民办工业的方针，不能办好工业。当前的问题是地委、县委如何以农业生产为中心办好工业等工作，使地委、县委做到“右手抓农业、左手抓工业”。会议认为，这需要总结各地的好经验加以推广，并初步决定地委、县委的第一书记必须挂帅办工业，一年、一季研究几次工业问题，专管工业的书记和委员则要以主要精力和主要时间研究工业的情况和问题。
    这次会议也分析了全省整风运动的情况，绝大多数的企业都出现了领导作风大转变、群众觉悟大提高和生产建设大跃进的划阶段的新局面。会议认为目前的问题不是对整风的胜利估计过高，而是估计不足。如果对整风运动的空前未有的大胜利估计不足，就不能满怀信心地建设社会主义。同时，会议也认为整风运动还未取得全胜，运动的发展也不平衡。因此，会议决定在6、7两个月中必须狠狠地把整风搞彻底，使领导作风根本转变，使右派分子完全孤立，把走资本主义的道路堵死，争取整风全胜。
