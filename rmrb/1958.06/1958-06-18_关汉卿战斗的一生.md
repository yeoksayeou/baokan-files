Guan Hanqing, the great playwright who was active in Beijing seven hundred years ago, spent his life in intense struggle; the dozen or so Zaju plays he left behind, which can still be read and even seen on stage, are his best testament.

Guan Hanqing lived approximately from the 1210s to the end of that century. Although China experienced several major events at that time, the nature of feudal society did not fundamentally change. The broad masses of working people were subjected to various forms of feudal exploitation. The Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues, loyalty, filial piety, and integrity, were still the moral dogmas commonly believed in. Women generally had no status in society. In short, the feudal social customs and habits that had long been formed in China still widely and profoundly influenced people's daily lives and mental outlook. The rulers of the Yuan Dynasty sent troops to garrison in various places in order to suppress the people's uprisings. These garrison troops and the large landlords who depended on them became a privileged class in society at that time, called "powerful and influential families." They could kill people at will without paying for it, and take other people's things and rob other people's women without being subject to legal sanctions.

Guan Hanqing spent his childhood near Beijing, the capital of the Jin Dynasty. From the tenth century, Beijing became the capital of the Liao Dynasty. After the Liao and Jin dynasties, Beijing became the political and cultural center of North China at that time, and produced many famous scholars and poets. After the Mongols destroyed the Jin Dynasty and stopped the imperial examinations, some of the literati in Beijing at that time, because their livelihoods were cut off and because they were unwilling to cooperate with the rulers, organized some creative groups called "Shuhui" (book societies) in Beijing, and wrote scripts and songs to meet the needs of the urban commoners for culture and art in cooperation with the performances in the urban amusement parks. The largest of these book societies was called "Yujing Shuhui." Most of the authors gathered in the "Yujing Shuhui" grew up in the Hebei-Liaodong area centered on Beijing. They had a common title, called "Yan-Zhao Talents." Since the "Yan-Zhao Talents" organized in the "Yujing Shuhui" had jointly experienced a fierce struggle against foreign invaders with the people of North China, and when the rule of the Yuan Dynasty stabilized, they were in the same position of being enslaved with the broad masses of Chinese people, which made them form a common tendency in the creation of opera. This common tendency is characterized by the strong combativeness and the sharpness of artistic images in the works. Guan Hanqing, because he was engaged in opera activities for the longest time, had the most works, and the greatest influence, became a peak among the many outstanding opera artists represented by "Yujing Shuhui" and "Yan-Zhao Talents" at that time. Without the love of opera by the broad masses of people at that time, and without the joint efforts of many outstanding opera artists at that time, this peak would not have appeared; and without this peak, the new height reached by many opera artists and folk artists in artistic creation at that time could not be reflected.

Guan Hanqing has been gone from us for more than six hundred years. Because he refused to write poems and prose to curry favor with the imperial dynasty at that time and squeeze into the ruling group, not even a biography has been handed down after his death. Based on some incomplete historical data, we speculate that he read many books in his youth and learned the writing of poetry, prose, lyrics, and music that literati at that time were good at. His unrestrained personality and enthusiastic and cheerful lifestyle quickly won him the favor of the people of Dadu (now Beijing) at that time, especially those oppressed and enslaved lower-class people. He was also good at various skills popular among the people at that time, such as playing the xiao, playing the qin, singing, and dancing. His friends Yang Xianzhi, Fei Junxiang, and Liang Jinzhi were all famous playwrights at that time. The female artists he knew, Zhu Lianxiu and Shun Shixiu, were all masters of Zaju performances at that time. He had also led theater troupes in Dadu, and sometimes performed on stage himself. In terms of opera, he was an all-around talent who could write, direct, and perform; and he was also an active figure with extensive connections with various aspects of opera activities at that time.

Guan Hanqing's extant Zaju plays include "Dou E Yuan", "Saving the Prostitute", "Single Blade Meeting", "Butterfly Dream", "Teasing the Wind and Moon", "Wangjiang Pavilion", "Worshiping the Moon Pavilion" and other eighteen kinds, (of which two or three are not very reliable). Although many other plays have been lost, their far-reaching influence can still be seen in stage art. For example, "Ping Xue Bian Zong", which we perform in Sichuan Opera today, and "Wu Tai Saves Brother", which we perform in Xiang Opera, cannot be unrelated to Guan Hanqing's "Wind and Snow Broken Kiln" and "Meng Liang Steals Bones."

Many of Guan Hanqing's opera works directly draw materials from the social reality at that time. When the Yuan Dynasty nobles ruled China, the dark forces within Chinese feudal society colluded with them and heavily oppressed the Chinese people. Some people within the Chinese people succumbed and escaped, some rose up to resist, and more endured for the time being and waited for the opportunity. When Guan Hanqing reflected these phenomena in his works, he did not photograph the life of these different characters indifferently like a camera, but enthusiastically praised those heroes who dared to fight against the enemy, criticized those soft worms who succumbed to the dark forces, and boldly exposed the various ugly faces of those who rode on the people's heads and acted like tyrants at that time.

Let us take his Zaju "Dou E Yuan" as an example. "Dou E Yuan" is a tragedy with a seven-hundred-year stage life. In the play, the widow Dou E lives with her mother-in-law. The rogue Zhang Lv'er and his son want to take her and her mother-in-law as wives. The mother-in-law succumbs, but Dou E resolutely refuses. Later, Zhang Lv'er puts poison in the mutton soup, trying to poison her mother-in-law, but accidentally poisons his own father to death. At this time, Zhang Lv'er takes the opportunity to threaten Dou E to marry him. Dou E does not accept his threat and goes to see the official with him, and is sentenced to death by the muddle-headed Chuzhou Prefect. When Dou E is tied to the execution ground, she cries out loudly, using her own bloody facts to point out that the people's grievances are the inevitable result of dark politics. She also swears to heaven, saying: If I, Dou E, am wronged to death, when the knife passes and my head falls, my full of blood will all fly and spray on that white flag, without a single drop falling to the ground, and the sky will send down three feet of heavy snow to cover my corpse. Sure enough, at the moment of Dou E's death, earth-shattering changes occurred, and it began to snow in the hot June.

Dou E's accusation of the dark politics at the time of her death was a powerful form of struggle that could be taken under the circumstances at that time. On the one hand, she fiercely exposed the enemy, and on the other hand, she called on all those who uphold justice to support her and continue her struggle. This is actually blowing the battle horn to all the persecuted people through stage art images. The appearance of miracles at the time of her death shows that the resistance force of the oppressed people is enough to shake the world. It is a strong expression of the ideology of the work, and at the same time a high concentration of artistic expression, concentrated to the realm of sublimation. Here, the voice of Dou E, the character in the play, is the voice of the author, and also the voice of all the persecuted people. Dou E's emotion is the author's emotion, and also the emotion of all the persecuted people. If the author's life were not connected with the broad masses of persecuted people, and he were not determined to use literary and artistic weapons to fight for all the sufferers at that time, it is hard to imagine that he would write such a heart-shaking work. Truly great works of art in ancient and modern times cannot be faked in the slightest. The existence of the Zaju "Dou E Yuan" fully proves Guan Hanqing's strong and unyielding fighting spirit. All bookworm-style historical research is useless here.

In his Zaju "Butterfly Dream", when Wang Po is forced to designate a son to pay for the life of the evil tyrant Ge Biao, she instructs that son that even if he dies, he must seek revenge on Ge Biao and push him off the "Looking Home Terrace". This spirit of resolutely retaliating against the enemy until death is completely consistent with the spirit expressed by the author in "Dou E Yuan" and another historical play "Guan Zhang Double Trip to Western Shu Dream". His other Zaju "Lu Zhai Lang" bloodily exposes the evil fact that "the powerful and influential families" Lu Zhai Lang arbitrarily snatch other people's wives. Although the author also sympathizes with Zhang Gui, who was forced to send his wife to Lu Zhai Lang's house in the play, he also criticizes his weakness and incompetence, and that his concession to the evil people led to the consequence of "the family disintegrating and scattering".

People have positive and negative attitudes towards life. Guan Hanqing's opera always highlights the positive aspects of real life, which educates people on how to face life and fight actively through stage art images. The fighting spirit of Guan Hanqing's opera is first manifested in this aspect.

The righteous characters in Guan Hanqing's operas generally do not fight the enemy bare-chested, rushing and slashing, but always try to find ways to strike the enemy more accurately and ruthlessly. Let's take his Zaju "Wangjiang Pavilion" and "Saving the Prostitute" as examples. Tan Ji'er, the protagonist of "Wangjiang Pavilion", went to Tanzhou with her husband to take office. The powerful minister Yang Yanei, in order to covet Tan Ji'er's beauty,奏zhòu准朝廷, took the powerful sword and golden tablet to Tanzhou, trying to kill her husband and seize her as a concubine. Tan Ji'er knew that Yang Yanei was fond of women and greedy for wine, so on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, she disguised herself as a fisherwoman, went to Yang Yanei's official boat to sell fish, and also drank wine and composed poems with him, talked about love, and got him drunk, taking away his golden tablet and powerful sword without him knowing. Zhao Pan'er, the protagonist of "Saving the Prostitute", in order to save her sworn sister Song Yinzhang, dressed up delicately and came to Zhengzhou, found Song Yinzhang's husband Zhou She, falsely said that she wanted to marry him, and designed to rescue Song Yinzhang, giving Zhou She a heavy blow. The author implies in these operas that all those who represent the dark forces of society, on the surface look big and arrogant, but when you tear off their tiger skin, they are nothing more than a pile of dung and pus. As long as we have enough estimation and full preparation for them, and attack their weaknesses unexpectedly, we can definitely win. Zhao Pan'er is a prostitute, and her opponent is an official young master and wealthy merchant. Tan Ji'er is the wife of a local official in Tanzhou, and her opponent is a high official sent by the court to investigate her husband. On the surface, the strength of the two sides is very different. However, when Zhao Pan'er is ready to go to Zhengzhou to see Zhou She, she says: "It's not that I'm boasting, but how can I get out of my brothel hands?" Tan Ji'er says when she knows that Yang Yanei is coming to murder her husband: "I'll make that bastard knock his head to see me, just like a divine lamb busy kneeling (meaning to make him kneel in front of me like a dead sheep offering sacrifices to the gods)." Their contempt for the enemy shows the revolutionary optimism of the oppressed people of our country's feudal historical period in their struggle against the enemy.

In the history of the oppressed people's resistance struggle, there are those who win because they correctly grasp the strategic principles of fighting against the enemy and make full preparations; and there are also those who fail because they lack preparation in advance and are panic-stricken when things happen. Guan Hanqing's opera educates people on how to take effective methods to strike the enemy and achieve victory through stage art images. This is another manifestation of the fighting spirit of his opera.

Guan Hanqing summarized the resolute attitude and effective methods of the people's resistance struggle in real life and expressed them through stage art images. Therefore, the basic spirit of the work is realism. And because of his love for life and his yearning for ideals, he has the optimism that many progressive writers in history have, so his works also have a positive romanticism color. When Tan Ji'er, dressed as a fisherwoman, comes on stage carrying a fish basket, she says: "Good fish! This fish is playing by the river, foraging for food, but I drove a lonely boat, spread out the net, and caught a three-foot brocade fish, still jumping alive." The clever readers and audience will naturally associate that this confident fisherwoman will catch not only the three-foot brocade fish when she spreads the net, but also the big bad guy Yang Yanei with the powerful sword and golden tablet.

In the history of Chinese opera, the struggle between realism and anti-realism runs through the entire history like two interlaced red and black lines. Guan Hanqing and his contemporary outstanding writers inherited the excellent traditions of folk artists since the Song and Jin dynasties and opened up a broad road for the development of realism in Chinese classical opera. Guan Hanqing's opera generally does not stay in the portrayal of superficial phenomena, but reveals the essential things in social reality through life phenomena. He clearly points out in his Gong'an (crime case) plays that the corruption and perversion of the law by officials is the root cause of all unjust cases; all official offices and military governments cannot uphold justice for the persecuted people. His love comedies point out that marriages decided by parents are incompatible with the happiness of the younger generation; allowing men to have multiple wives brings suffering to many young women. His Zaju "Golden Thread Pond" believes through the self-declaration of the prostitute Du Xinniang that all one hundred and twenty lines are good for eating, only her line is "the door of injustice". Xie Tianxiang, the protagonist prostitute in his Zaju "Thanking Heaven Xiang", points to the parrot in the cage and says to her companions: "You say that the parrot in the golden cage can recite poems, this is like our family, the more clever the more you can't get out of the cage". It tells the common fate of many people who fell into the fire pit at that time. In the Zaju "Saving the Prostitute", when Zhou She wants to hit Song Yinzhang with a big stick, he says: "A husband who beats his wife to death should not pay for his life." This shows that men dared to abuse their wives at that time because they were supported by the law. From these points of view, the progressive thinking expressed by the author in his works is the fundamental reason for his achievements in realist art.

The vividness of the character images in Guan Hanqing's Zaju is also rare among playwrights in ancient and modern times. The lower-class people of our feudal society were deprived of the right to read and write. They went to "Wasi Goulan" (theatres) to watch operas, not only for entertainment, but also to learn social experience and historical lessons from here. When they face a moving performance, because the character images in the play are so black and white, they cannot but follow the development of the plot and become more and more concerned about the fate of the kind characters in the play, and hate those evil people who do evil. Because these artistic images have left unforgettable marks in their emotions, when they come into contact with or think of something related to the characters in the play in real life, they are as sensitive as touching a scar. Guan Hanqing's operas such as "Dou E Yuan", "Lu Zhai Lang", "Saving the Prostitute", and "Worshiping the Moon Pavilion" always reveal people with bloody realistic lessons, not just a few dry maxims. Because it infects readers and audiences through vivid artistic images, instead of like some conceptualized and formulaic plays, it can only call the characters to put on makeup and come on stage to recite his creeds.

The vividness of the character images in Guan Hanqing's Zaju depends on the sharpness of the contradictions and the clarity of the personalities of the positive and negative characters in the play, and at the same time it is the result of the author's typification of the character images. The author often leads the characters step by step to the tip of the contradiction through the development of the drama plot and carves them. These characters on the one hand have their own unique and vivid personalities; on the other hand, they have extensive connections with the relationship between people in feudal society, especially the relationship between the oppressed class and the oppressing class. Every audience can learn lessons from these vivid artistic images, know who to support, who to hate, and also know how to take effective methods, choose favorable opportunities, and ruthlessly strike the enemy, while protecting themselves. Through these artistic typical images, Guan Hanqing vividly expressed the excellent qualities of the Chinese oppressed people and their indomitable struggle against the enemy, so that for seven hundred years, thousands of audiences and readers have been encouraged by their fighting spirit and victorious confidence, and strengthened people's courage and confidence to break through the many obstacles in various historical periods and move forward victoriously. This is the objective artistic effect and huge educational significance of a series of stage artistic images created by Guan Hanqing.

Guan Hanqing lived in a dark period of "like an arrow piercing through the mouth of a wild goose, no one dares to cough". At that time, the law stipulated that anyone who "falsely compiled lyrics and music" and "committed evil words against the superiors" would be sentenced to beheading or exile. Guan Hanqing wrote more than sixty plays in his long-term opera activities from the mid-thirteenth century to the last page of this century, not just one or two. Most of these sixty plays not only "committed evil words against the superiors", but also painted the ugly faces of all kinds of members of the ruling class, allowing the positive characters representing the people on the stage and the audience off the stage to jointly point at their noses and scold them, or add sarcastic ridicule. His opera activities were in Dadu, where the power of the Yuan Dynasty rulers was concentrated, and it was impossible for him not to attract the attention of the rulers, who tried to obstruct and persecute him; he himself had to launch various open and secret struggles with the rulers in order for his opera activities to continue. Due to the hostility of the ruling class towards these writers who dared to speak for the people, it is impossible for us today to find records of his activities in this regard from the historical data that has always been in the hands of the ruling class. However, is it possible for us to explain the fighting life of this great writer based on the historical situation at that time and the strong popularity and fighting spirit expressed in Guan Hanqing's opera? It is entirely possible. Guan Hanqing's life of struggle was not only carried out in the field of opera activities through creative practice, but also closely linked with many folk artists at that time (who were actually the women who were most deeply insulted and persecuted) and the broad masses of oppressed people to carry out various overt or covert struggles to strike the enemy and protect themselves. From what Guan Hanqing expressed in his opera, he was fully confident and had ways to deal with the persecution of those corrupt feudal officials like pustules. Guan Yu, who was shaped in his historical play "Single Blade Meeting", also has the artistic magic to encourage people to face the battle with his heroic and bold spirit, going to the battlefield that the enemy had arranged in advance with a single horse and a single knife.

However, Guan Hanqing is, after all, a writer who has been gone from us for more than six hundred years. Although his opera at that time had already played a strong fighting role, actively supporting people to fight against various unreasonable social phenomena, it was still impossible to find a perfect way to solve the problem. His Gong'an plays can only be judged by a wise official in the end, and the ending of his love plays is also inevitably reluctantly reunited. This is the limitation of the author's era, and also the limitation of realism in classical opera. The author could not see the way out of feudal society at that time, and could not reveal it to the audience through stage art.

Guan Hanqing's appearance in China in the thirteenth century is not only the glory of our people, but also left a valuable legacy for the progressive human beings of the world. This year, the World Peace Council is launching extensive activities around the world to commemorate the 700th anniversary of his opera activities. Our purpose today in commemorating all the great writers in history is to inherit their excellent traditions and serve the socialist cultural construction of our country. Judging from the opera left by Guan Hanqing, what is most worthy of our learning is the combativeness and realism spirit expressed in the works. If Guan Hanqing seven hundred years ago, under the shroud of heavy dark forces, already dared to use literary and artistic weapons to strike the enemy. Then, today we have full conditions to clear everything that hinders our progress and promote the fighting role of literature and art. If Guan Hanqing seven hundred years ago had already deeply entered the lives of the lower-class people and absorbed a large number of realistic themes to write plays, today we must more consciously go deep into the workers, peasants and soldiers and write more and better plays that express our new great era and heroic people. This is the glorious task of all opera workers today, and we are fully confident to complete this glorious task.

    关汉卿战斗的一生
    王季思
    七百年前活动在北京的大戏曲家关汉卿，是在紧张的战斗里度过他的一生的；他遗留下来的至今还可以读到甚至从舞台上看到的十几个杂剧剧本是他最好的见证人。
    关汉卿大约生活在十三世纪的一十年代到那世纪的末期。当时中国虽然经历了几次重大的事变，但并没有从根本上改变封建社会的性质。广大劳动人民受到各式各样封建性的剥削，三纲五常、忠孝节义，依然是人们共同崇信的道德教条，妇女在社会上普遍没有地位。总之，在中国长期形成的封建社会风俗习惯，依然广泛而深刻地影响着人们的日常生活与精神面貌。元朝的统治者为了镇压人民的起义，派军队在各地驻防。这些驻防军和依附他们的大地主在当时社会成为一种特权人物，叫作“权豪势要之家”。他们可以任意杀人而无须偿命，任意拿人家的东西、抢人家的妇女而不受法律的制裁。
    关汉卿的少年时期在金国的首都北京附近度过。北京从十世纪起就成为辽国的首都。辽、金以后，北京就成为当时北中国政治文化的中心，产生了不少著名的学者与诗人。蒙古灭了金国又停止了科举之后，当时在北京的一些文人由于生活上断绝了出路，也由于他们不愿意跟统治者合作，在北京组织了一些叫作“书会”的创作团体，配合都市游艺场的演出，写些剧本与唱本来满足当时城市平民对文化艺术的需要。这些书会里规模最大的一个叫“玉京书会”。聚集在“玉京书会”里的作者，大多数生长在以北京为中心的河北辽东一带。他们有个共同称号，叫作“燕赵才人”。组织在“玉京书会”里的“燕赵才人”，既然跟北中国人民共同经历过一场抵抗外来侵略者的激烈斗争，在元朝的统治稳定下来时，他们又跟广大中国人民共同处在被奴役的地位；这就使他们在戏曲创作上形成了共同的倾向。这种共同倾向是以作品战斗性的强烈和艺术形象的鲜明为其特征的。关汉卿由于从事戏曲的活动最长久，作品最多，影响也最大，成为当时以“玉京书会”“燕赵才人”为代表的许多优秀戏曲家里的一个顶峰。没有当时广大人民对戏曲的爱好，没有当时许多优秀戏曲家的共同努力，这顶峰不会出现；而没有这个顶峰，也不能体现当时许多戏曲家与民间艺人在艺术创造上所达到的新的高度。
    关汉卿离开我们已经六百多年，由于他不肯写诗写文来巴结当时的皇朝，挤到统治集团里面去，他死后就连一篇行状都没有流传下来。我们根据一些残缺不全的历史资料推测，知道他少年时读过很多书，学会了当时文人们擅长的诗文词曲的写作。他的放浪不羁的性格与热情爽朗的生活作风，使他很快就获得当时大都（即现在的北京）人民的好感，尤其是那些被压迫被奴役的下层人民。他还擅长当时民间流行的各种技艺，如吹箫、弹琴、歌唱、舞蹈等。他的朋友杨显之、费君祥、梁进之都是当时著名的戏曲作家。他所认识的女艺人珠帘秀、顺时秀都是当时演唱杂剧的能手。他在大都时还曾领导过剧团，有时自己也登台演唱。就戏曲部门说，他是一个能编能导又能演的全面人才；又跟当时各方面戏曲活动有着广泛联系的活跃人物。
    关汉卿流传下来的杂剧有“窦娥冤”、“救风尘”、“单刀会”、“蝴蝶梦”、“调风月”、“望江亭”、“拜月亭”等十八种，（其中两三种不大可靠）。其他许多剧本虽已失传，但在舞台艺术上依然可以看出它的深远影响。如我们今天在川剧里演出的“评雪辨踪”，湘剧里演出的“五台救弟”，不可能与关汉卿的“风雪破窑记”，“孟良盗骨”没有渊源。
    关汉卿的戏曲作品有不少是直接从当时社会现实吸取题材的。当元朝贵族统治中国的时候，中国封建社会内部的黑暗势力跟他们勾结起来沉重地压在中国人民的头上。中国人民内部有的屈服、逃避，有的起来反抗，更多的是暂时忍耐下来等待时机。关汉卿在作品里反映这些现象时，不是像照相机一样无动于衷地把这些不同人物的生活面貌摄影下来，而是热烈歌颂那些敢于对敌斗争的英雄，批判那些对黑暗势力屈服的软虫，大胆揭露当时骑在人民头上作威作福的各种丑恶的嘴脸。
    我们试举他的杂剧“窦娥冤”作例。“窦娥冤”是一个有着七百年舞台生命的悲剧。剧中寡妇窦娥跟她婆婆相守度日。流氓张驴儿父子要霸占她婆媳为妻，婆婆屈服了，窦娥坚决不从。后来张驴儿下毒药在羊肚儿汤里，企图药死她婆婆，却意外地药死了他自己的老子。这时张驴儿又乘机威胁窦娥嫁给他。窦娥不受他的威胁，跟他去见官，被糊涂的楚州太守判处死罪。当窦娥绑赴法场处斩时，她大声疾呼，用本身血淋淋的事实指出人民的含冤不白是黑暗政治的必然结果。他还对天誓愿说：如果我窦娥是冤枉死的，刀过头落，我的满腔鲜血将都飞喷在那面白旗上，没有半点落地，天要降三尺大雪遮盖我的尸首。果然在窦娥临死的片刻发生了惊天动地的变化，在六月的大热天里下起雪来。
    窦娥临死时对当时黑暗政治的控诉，是在当时情况下所可能采取的有力的斗争方式。她一面狠狠地揭露敌人，一面呼吁一切主持正义的人支持她也继续她的斗争。这实际是通过舞台艺术形象对一切被迫害的人民吹起了战斗的号角。她临死时奇迹的出现，表现了被压迫人民的反抗力量足以惊天动地。它是作品思想的强烈表现，同时是艺术表现的高度集中，集中到了升华的境界。这里，剧中人物窦娥的声音，就是作者的声音，也就是一切受迫害人民的声音。窦娥的感情就是作者的感情，也就是一切受迫害人民的感情。如果不是作者的生活跟广大受迫害人民有血肉的联系，坚决要利用文艺武器为当时一切受难者战斗，很难想像他会写出那样震动人心的作品。古今真正伟大的艺术作品来不得丝毫假借，“窦娥冤”杂剧本身的存在，充分证明了关汉卿坚强不屈的战斗精神，一切书呆子式的历史考证在这里是用不上的。
    他的“蝴蝶梦”杂剧里的王婆婆当被迫要指定一个儿子给恶霸葛彪偿命时，她分咐那儿子即使死了也要找葛彪报仇，把他推下“望乡台”去。这种对敌人坚决报复至死不休的精神，跟作者在“窦娥冤”及另一个历史戏“关张双赴西蜀梦”里所表现的精神完全一致。他另一个杂剧“鲁斋郎”血淋淋地揭露“权豪势要之家”鲁斋郎任意抢夺人家妻子的罪恶事实。作者对剧中被迫送妻子到鲁斋郎家去的张珪，虽然也同情他的遭遇，同时又批判他的懦弱无能，对恶人让步，招致了“一家儿瓦解星飞”的后果。
    人们对于生活的态度有积极的，有消极的。关汉卿的戏曲总是突出现实生活里带有积极意义的东西，这就通过舞台艺术形象教育人们怎样面向人生，积极战斗，关汉卿戏曲的战斗精神首先表现在这一方面。
    关汉卿戏曲里正面人物的对敌斗争，一般不是赤膊上阵，猛砍猛冲，而总是想尽办法更准也更狠地打击敌人。试拿他的“望江亭”杂剧和“救风尘”杂剧作例。“望江亭”的主角谭记儿跟丈夫到潭州作官。权臣杨衙内为了贪慕谭记儿的姿色，奏准朝廷，带着势剑金牌到潭州去，企图杀害她的丈夫，夺取她作妾。谭记儿知道杨衙内的好色贪杯，在中秋夜里扮作渔妇，到杨衙内官船上卖鱼，还和他饮酒赋诗，谈情说爱，灌得他烂醉如泥，把他的金牌势剑都拿走了他还不知道。“救风尘”的主角赵盼儿为救她的结拜姊妹宋引章，打扮得娇娇滴滴的到了郑州，找到了宋引章的丈夫周舍，假说自己要嫁给他，设计救出了宋引章，给周舍以重重的打击。作者在这些戏曲里暗示我们：一切代表社会黑暗势力的人物，表面看起来大模大样，气焰万丈，撕开他们的老虎皮一看，却不过一堆狗屎与脓包。只要我们对他们有足够的估计与充分的准备，出其不意地向他们的弱点进攻，就一定可以取胜。赵盼儿是个妓女，她的对手是个官少爷兼阔商人。谭记儿是潭州一个地方官的妻子，她的对手是朝廷派来查办她丈夫的大官。表面看来，双方势力悬殊。然而赵盼儿当准备好一切到郑州去见周舍时说：“不是我说大口，怎出得我这烟月手”。谭记儿知道杨衙内要来谋害她丈夫时说：“我着那厮磕着头见一番，恰便是神羊儿忙跪膝（意说要他像祭神的死羊儿一样跪在我面前）。”她们对敌人的藐视，表现了我国封建历史时期被压迫人民对敌斗争的革命乐观主义精神。
    历史上被压迫人民的反抗斗争，有因正确掌握了对敌斗争的战略原则，作好充分的准备而取胜的；也有因事先缺乏准备，临事又张皇失措而失败的。关汉卿的戏曲通过舞台艺术形象教育人们怎样采取有效方法打击敌人，取得胜利。这是他的戏曲的战斗精神的另一方面表现。
    关汉卿概括了现实生活里人民反抗斗争的坚决态度与有效方法，通过舞台艺术形象表现出来，因此作品的基本精神是现实主义的。又由于他对人生的热爱，对理想的憧憬，具有历史上许多进步作家所具有的乐观主义精神，因此他的作品又带有积极浪漫主义的色彩。当谭记儿扮作渔妇提着鱼篮上场时说：“好鱼也！这鱼在那江边游戏，趁浪寻食，却被我驾一孤舟，撒开网去，打出三尺锦鳞，还活活泼泼的乱跳。”聪明的读者与观众将很自然地联想起：这位信心百倍的渔妇撒开网打到的将不仅是三尺锦鳞，同时还有那带着势剑金牌的大坏蛋杨衙内。
    我国戏曲史上现实主义与反现实主义的斗争像两根交互着的红线与黑线贯穿着全史。关汉卿与他同时代的优秀作家继承了宋金以来民间艺人的优秀传统，为我国古典戏曲的现实主义发展开辟了广阔的道路。关汉卿的戏曲一般不停留在表面现象的描画，而是透过生活现象揭示社会现实里带有本质意义的东西。他在公案戏里明白指出官吏的贪赃枉法是造成一切冤狱的根本原因；一切官厅、军府不可能替受迫害的人民主持正义。他的爱情喜剧指出由父母作主的婚姻跟青年一代的幸福不相容；允许男人多妻给许多青年妇女带来痛苦。他的“金线池”杂剧通过妓女杜芯娘的自白，认为一百二十行，门门都好吃饭，只有她这一行是“不义之门”。他的“谢天香”杂剧里的主角妓女谢天香指着笼子里的鹦哥对她的伴侣们说：“你道是金笼内鹦哥能念诗，这便是咱家的好比似，原来越聪明越不得出笼时”。道出了当时许多陷落在火坑里的人们的共同命运。在“救风尘”杂剧里，当周舍要拿大棍子打宋引章时说：“丈夫打杀老婆不该偿命。”这就说明当时男人敢于虐待妻子是因为他们得到法律的支持。从这些地方看，作者在作品里所表现的进步思想是他在现实主义艺术上取得成就的根本原因。
    关汉卿杂剧中人物形象的鲜明同样是古今剧作家里所少见的。我国封建社会的下层人民被剥夺了识字读书的权利。他们到“瓦肆勾栏”里看戏，不仅仅为了消遣娱乐，同时也从这里吸取社会经验与历史教训。当他们面对一次动人的演出时，由于剧中人物形象是如此黑白分明，他们不能不跟着剧情的变化发展愈来愈关心剧中善良人物的命运，痛恨那些为非作歹的恶人。由于这些艺术形象曾经在他们感情上留下刻骨的铭记，当他们在现实生活里接触到或联想起跟剧中人物有联系的东西时，就像触痛伤疤一样的敏感。关汉卿的戏曲如“窦娥冤”、“鲁斋郎”、“救风尘”、“拜月亭”等，总是揭示人们以血淋淋的现实教训，而不是干巴巴的几条格言。因为它是通过鲜明的艺术形象来感染读者与观众，而不是像有些概念化、公式化的剧作，只能叫人物化妆上台来念他的教条。
    关汉卿杂剧人物形象的鲜明，决定于剧中正反面人物矛盾的尖锐、性格的分明，同时是作者对人物形象进行典型化的结果。作者每每通过戏剧情节的发展，把人物一步步引向矛盾的尖端，加以刻划。这些人物一方面有着自己独特的鲜明的个性；一方面对封建社会人与人的关系，特别是被压迫阶级与压迫阶级的关系，具有广泛的联系。每个观众都可以从这些鲜明的艺术形象里接受教训，知道支持什么人，憎恨什么人，还知道怎样采取有效的方法，选择有利的时机，狠狠地打击敌人，同时保护了自己。关汉卿通过这些艺术典型形象，生气勃勃地表现了中国被压迫人民的优秀品质和他们对敌人坚强不屈的斗争，使七百年来千千万万观众与读者为他们的战斗精神与胜利信心所鼓舞，加强了人们冲破各个历史时期重重障碍而胜利前进的勇气与信心。这是关汉卿所塑造的一连串舞台艺术形象的客观艺术效果与巨大教育意义。
    关汉卿生活在“如箭穿着雁口，没个人敢咳嗽”的黑暗时期。当时法律规定凡“妄撰词曲”，“犯上恶言”的人要被判处杀头或流放。关汉卿从十三世纪中期起到这世纪的末页，在他长期的戏曲活动里不止写一本两本，而是写了六十多本戏。这六十多本戏里的绝大部分作品不仅仅“犯上恶言”，而是把统治阶级里各色各样的丑恶嘴脸画出来，让舞台上代表人民的正面人物与台下的观众共同指着他们的鼻子痛骂，或加以辛辣的嘲笑。他的这种戏曲活动正在元朝统治者权力集中的大都，他不可能不引起统治者的注意，企图加以阻挠与迫害；他自己也不能不为他的戏曲活动能够继续下去跟统治者展开了各式各样的斗争。由于统治阶级对这些敢于替人民说话的作家的敌视，我们今天不可能从向来掌握在统治阶级手里的历史资料里，找到有关于他这方面活动的记载。然而我们是否有可能根据当时的历史形势与关汉卿戏曲里所表现的强烈的人民性与战斗性，说明这位伟大作家战斗的一生呢？那是完全有可能的，关汉卿一生的战斗不仅通过创作实践在戏曲活动范围内展开，同时跟当时许多民间艺人
  （实际上就是受侮辱受迫害最深的妇女）以及广大受压迫的人们密切联系，进行各种或明或暗的斗争来打击敌人保护自己。从关汉卿在戏曲里所表现的看，怎样对付那些腐朽得像脓包一样的封建官吏的迫害，他是完全有信心也有办法的。他的历史戏“单刀会”中塑造的关云长，以他英勇而豪迈的气概，匹马单刀，走向敌人预先安排好了的战场，同样具有鼓舞人们面向战斗的艺术魔力。
    然而关汉卿毕竟是离开我们已经六百多年的作家，他的戏曲在当时虽然已经起了强烈的战斗作用，积极支持人们对各种不合理的社会现象作斗争，却依然不可能找出一条完满解决问题的道路。他的公案戏最后还只能由一个贤明的官吏来判案，他的男女爱情戏的结局也不免勉强团圆。这是作者时代的局限性，也是古典戏曲现实主义的局限性。作者在当时既不可能看到封建社会的出路，也就不可能通过舞台艺术把它揭示给观众。
    关汉卿在十三世纪的中国出现，不仅是我国人民的光荣，同时替世界进步人类留下了一笔珍贵的遗产。今年世界和平理事会为纪念他从事戏曲活动的七百周年，在全世界范围内展开广泛的活动。我们今天纪念历史上一切伟大作家，目的在继承他们优秀的传统为我国社会主义文化建设服务。从关汉卿遗留下来的戏曲看，他最值得我们学习的是作品中所表现的战斗性与现实主义精神。如果七百年前的关汉卿，在重重黑暗势力的笼罩之下，已经敢于利用文艺武器来打击敌人。那么，我们今天就完全有充分条件扫清一切阻碍我们前进的东西，发扬文艺的战斗作用。如果七百年前的关汉卿已经深入下层人民生活，大量吸取现实题材写戏，我们今天就更要自觉地深入工农兵，写出更多也更好的表现我们新的伟大时代的戏曲。
    向来我们从事戏曲工作的同志们往往有一种成见，好像富有民族色彩的戏曲就只能演历史故事，只适宜于表现男女爱情。其实今天流传下来的关汉卿的戏曲就不是如此。明清以来一些划时代的巨著如无名氏的“鸣凤记”、李玉的“清忠谱”、孔尚任的“桃花扇”，也都是写当时的或离开他们不远的政治斗争的戏。今天，全国人民正以排山倒海的气势向社会主义道路大跃进，各种新的震动人心的奇迹正在我们生活中不断出现。几年来我国戏曲在毛主席及党中央正确的文艺方针指导之下，在国内国际都起了巨大的影响。今天我们纪念这位七百年前活动在北京的伟大戏曲家关汉卿，必须大力克服戏曲工作中认为戏曲不适宜于表现现代生活的保守思想，更多更快也更好地写出无愧于我们的伟大时代与英雄人民的作品。这是今天一切戏曲工作者的光辉任务，我们完全有信心完成这个光辉的任务。
