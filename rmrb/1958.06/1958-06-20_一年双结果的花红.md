    A Crabapple Tree with Double Harvests in One Year
    Liu Qiwen, a 72-year-old farmer and horticulturist from Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, had two harvests from his two crabapple trees in 1957. These two crabapple trees have bloomed once a year for the past forty years, yielding 120-130 catties of fruit. In 1957, they bore fruit twice. The first time they blossomed during the Qingming Festival and matured before the Autumn Begins, yielding 130 catties of fruit. The second time they blossomed during the Autumn Equinox and matured during the Winter Solstice, yielding 45 catties of fruit. The fruit from the second harvest was redder in color and had a particularly sweet taste.
