　　Notes

　　Trade and Politics
　　Although Nobusuke Kishi is making a lot of noise about being friendly with the United States, the American movement to exclude Japanese goods has not improved at all. Recently, the US Congress is very likely to pass a bill restricting the import of Japanese tuna. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Koichiro Asakai, has already told the US government that this is an "unfriendly attitude towards Japan."
　　Doesn't Nobusuke Kishi like to say "trade is trade, politics is politics"? Since this is the case, then just be "friendly" with the United States, why make such a fuss about the United States restricting Japanese tuna, and even bring up words like "unfriendly"!
　　It can be seen from the relationship between Japan and the United States that what Nobusuke Kishi said about "separating trade and politics" is nothing but lies.

    贸易和政治
    虽然岸信介把对美亲善叫得震天价响，可是美国的排斥日货运动却一点不见好转。最近美国国会又有很大可能通过限制日本鲔鱼进口法案。日本驻美国大使朝海浩一郎已经向美国政府表示这是“对日本采取的不友好态度”。
    岸信介不是很喜欢说“贸易是贸易，政治是政治”吗？既然如此，那就尽管跟美国“亲善”好了，又何必对美国限制日本鲔鱼大嚷大叫，还抬出什么“不友好”之类的话头呢！
    可见，从日美关系看，岸信介所说的“把贸易和政治分开”也不外是骗人的鬼话。
