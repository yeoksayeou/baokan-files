(Our dispatch) The people of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, are working with twenty-four times the energy, focusing on the central task of "500,000 panicles per mu," earnestly implementing various technical measures, and strengthening rice field management to strive for a bumper rice harvest.

The more than 400,000 mu of early rice in Changshu County finished transplanting ten days earlier than in previous years, and most of the seedlings have already turned green and are tillering. The 680,000 mu of late rice is being planted against drought conditions, striving to complete all planting ahead of schedule. Drawing on the rich experience of "catching rice with three wheat crops" and the lessons of the "innate deficiencies" of the three wheat crops, the agricultural cooperatives have basically ensured that measures are taken before action for rice, meticulously grasping everything from the beginning, leaving no field untouched. The three key measures of deep plowing, dense planting, and sufficient fertilizer are being implemented very well. Dry rice is generally plowed to a depth of six inches, and late rice is deepened to eight inches or more. The base fertilizer averages 400 dan per mu, and the method of applying fertilizer in layers is earnestly implemented, with a 30% increase in base fertilizer for third-class fields. In terms of dense planting, three methods are adopted to ensure that 500,000 panicles per mu are achieved.

At present, agricultural cooperatives in the early rice areas have comprehensively begun the first topdressing and weeding to promote early tillering. For early rice that has not yet revived and for some late rice fields, various localities are inspecting seedlings and replanting, adding seedlings or rows according to the situation to increase density.

In order to adapt to the new conditions of deep plowing and dense planting this year, the Changshu County Party Committee had already conducted thorough research on rice field management issues before the comprehensive start of sowing. Sui Xingchu, Secretary of the Changshu County Party Committee, and Liu Lirong, a member of the County Party Committee, after conducting on-the-spot inspections and carefully studying with technicians and veteran farmers, formulated a plan to conduct a large-scale high-yield rice experiment on 125 mu of Zhoujia圩. This plan addresses the past problems of increased panicles after dense planting, but the panicles often become smaller, the rate of empty and shriveled grains increases, and late-emerging small panicles increase. A series of technical measures have been arranged to break away from past routines, ensuring that dense planting results in more panicles, larger panicles, uniform panicles, reduced shriveled grains, and increased mature grain weight, aiming for high yields of 3,000 to 5,000 jin per mu in some areas.

In terms of rice field management, Changshu County mainly focuses on the three major links of water, fertilizer, and pests, and based on the new situation of dense planting, specifically puts forward the requirements of "three essentials and three preventions" to achieve early tillering, clean roots (reducing diseases), and stable growth. The three essentials are: timely topdressing, strengthening water and slurry management, and timely cultivating and weeding. The three preventions are: preventing rice borers, preventing rice blast, and preventing lodging.

Each agricultural cooperative has designated special personnel to be responsible for the management of rice field irrigation, ensuring shallow and frequent irrigation. According to the requirement of dan of fertilizer per jin of grain, each agricultural cooperative is preparing to apply more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, increasing the amount of fertilizer by ten times compared to the normal level. Currently, it is necessary to continuously apply two topdressings of tillering fertilizer to promote early and prolific tillering of seedlings, achieving the target of 500,000 panicles per mu.

The entire county, from top to bottom, has established command headquarters for pest and disease prevention, preparing to fight four major battles based on the occurrence patterns of rice stem borers, not allowing rice borers to raise their heads. The first battle has already been won, and many agricultural cooperatives have achieved one gasoline lamp per 50 mu, one calcium carbide lamp per 10 mu, one mast lamp per 5 mu, and one small square lamp per 3 mu, annihilating a large number of first-generation rice stem borer moths.

Changshu County was the first county in Jiangsu Province to propose the competition slogan "Catch rice with three wheat crops, double rice production." This year, the three wheat crops achieved a bumper harvest, more than doubling last year's output, and large areas achieved production records of the three wheat crops catching up with and exceeding rice production. The great leap forward in the production of the three wheat crops has further liberated people's minds, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is even greater. The target of "doubling rice production" can no longer satisfy people's demands (the county's average rice yield last year was 450 jin per mu). Many townships and cooperatives have revised the original target of 1,000 jin to 2,000 jin. Some townships and cooperatives have also set even higher targets.

    要水稻亩长50万穗
    常熟人民以冲天干劲　从头抓起　一着不漏
    本报讯　江苏省常熟县人民正以二十四分干劲，围绕“亩亩五十万穗”的中心要求，切实贯彻各项技术措施，加强稻田管理，争取水稻大丰收。
    常熟县四十多万亩早稻比往年提前十天栽插结束，大部分秧苗已转青分蘖。六十八万亩晚稻正在抗旱抢栽，力争提前全部栽好。各农业社吸取了三麦赶水稻的丰富经验，及三麦“先天不足”的教训，对水稻基本上做到措施抓在行动之前，一亩不让，一着不漏地从头抓起。深耕、密植、肥足这三个当前的关键性措施贯彻得都很好。旱稻普遍深耕六寸、晚稻加深到八寸以上。基肥平均每亩四百担，切实贯彻了分层施肥的方法，三类田都增加基肥30％。密植方面采取三种办法保证达到每亩五十万穗。
    目前早稻地区的农业社已全面开始第一次追肥、耘耥，促使提早分蘖。对没有醒棵的早稻和部分晚稻田，各地正查苗补秧，分别情况加株、添行，增加密度。
    为了适应今年深耕、密植等新情况，中共常熟县委早在下种全面开始之前，就切实研究了稻田管理问题。中共常熟县委书记隋性初、县委委员刘立荣两同志，经过实地察看，和技术员、老农仔细研究，订出了一个在一百二十五亩的周家圩进行大面积水稻高产试验的计划。这个计划针对过去密植后穗子虽然增多，但往往穗子变小，空秕率增加，后窜的小穗增多等问题，安排了一系列的技术措施，要跳出过去的常规，保证密植后穗多、穗大、穗齐、减少秕粒，增加熟粒重，分片达到三千斤至五千斤的高产目的。
    在稻田管理方面，常熟县主要抓水、肥、病虫三个主要环节，根据密植的新情况，具体提出了三要、三防的要求，达到提早分蘖、根脚清爽（减少病害）、长势平稳的目的。三要是：要适时追肥、要加强水浆管理、要及时中耕除草。三防是：防螟害、防稻热病、防倒伏。
    各农业社确定专人负责管理稻田灌溉，保证做到浅水勤灌。根据担肥斤粮的要求，各农业社都准备每亩施肥二千担以上，施肥量比常年水平增加十倍。目前要连续追施两次分蘖肥，促使秧苗提早分蘖、多分蘖，达到每亩五十万穗的要求。
    全县从上到下已建立了防治病虫害的指挥部，准备根据螟蛾的发生规律大战四个回合，不让螟虫抬头。现在第一个回合已经获胜，很多农业社做到五十亩一盏汽油灯，十亩一盏电石灯，五亩一盏桅灯，三亩一盏小方灯，歼灭了大量三化螟一代螟蛾。
    常熟县是首先向江苏全省提出“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”竞赛倡议的一个县。今年三麦获得了比去年增产一倍多的大丰收，出现了大面积三麦赶上水稻和超过水稻的丰产纪录。三麦产量的大跃进进一步解放了人们的思想，干部和群众的干劲也更足了。“水稻翻一番”的指标已经不能满足人们的要求（全县去年水稻平均单产四百五十斤）。许多乡、社把原来的千斤指标修改为双千斤。有些乡、社还订出了更高的指标。
