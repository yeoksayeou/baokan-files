    Helping Huangjing Township Achieve Cotton Field Production Increase Plan
    Mianyang County Launches Communist Collaboration

    (Our Newspaper) According to Hubei Daily: Huangjing Township in Mianyang has ensured the realization of its double-thousand-jin plan for 700 mu of cotton fields by receiving support in cotton seedlings and manpower from neighboring brotherly townships for the work of transplanting large seedlings to replace small ones.

    Huangjing Township's more than 700 mu of high-yield cotton experimental fields, which were trying for double-thousand-jin this year, suffered from over twenty consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather, two cold snaps, and one hailstorm in late April. This caused a widespread lack of seedlings in the cotton fields. After four replantings and catch-up plantings, the seedlings were replenished, but they were of varying sizes. Some large ones already had six leaves, while small ones had just emerged from the soil. How could such a mixed bunch of cotton seedlings achieve the double-thousand-jin goal? Replanting would mean missing the season; not replanting would mean a huge loss of cotton seedlings and certainly low yields. What to do? After repeated research, discussions, and brainstorming by the Township Party Committee, and as a result of the struggle against conservative thinking, it was decided to adopt the method of transplanting large seedlings to replace small ones to strive for more autumn bolls and ensure the realization of the double-thousand-jin plan. After this measure was proposed, two major difficulties were encountered: a shortage of seedling sources and a lack of labor. According to the results of a survey and calculation, in addition to the 40% of cotton seedlings that could be solved by mutual adjustment within the fields, the remaining 60% of the fields still needed a total of 2 million cotton seedlings that could not be resolved; if each mu required 60 workdays for both transplanting and planting, a total of 24,000 workdays would be needed, equivalent to eight full days of labor for the entire township. Faced with such difficulties, would they stand tall and overcome them, or would they retreat in fear and bow their heads to the difficulties? The Huangjing Township Party Committee and the people of the township chose the former. Encouraged by the determination to successfully manage the 700 mu of double-thousand-jin fields and win glory for the county, they finally made the decision to transplant large seedlings to replace small ones, something that predecessors dared not even think of. They believed that as long as they fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and researched and found solutions together with the masses, there would be no difficulties that could not be overcome. After the Township Party Committee reported this resolution and determination to the County Party Committee, it immediately received strong support and encouragement from the County Party Committee, which immediately drew more than 2,000 people, including cadres from the neighboring Xiantao Town and Changchangkou District, residents, and agricultural cooperative members, to provide support. It also called on the brotherly townships and cooperatives neighboring Huangjing Township to launch a seedling donation campaign for Huangjing Township's 700 mu, under the principle of not affecting their own full seedling situation. Eight agricultural cooperatives in Huangjing Township also dispatched 1,200 laborers to cooperate in a five-day-and-night blitz. After the County Party Committee issued the call, in less than a day, more than 2,000 laborers from Xiantao Town and Changchangkou District arrived in Huangjing Township with their own baskets, shovels, hoes, and cotton seedling nutrient pots, and joined the Huangjing Township cooperative members in the transplanting campaign. People who came to support brought out all kinds of utensils such as gift-carrying boxes, vegetable baskets, and bamboo baskets to transport cotton seedlings, demonstrating a new style of communism.

    In order to cherish this spirit of communist collaboration, not to waste a single laborer, and to ensure the quality of cotton seedling transplanting, the Huangjing Township Party Committee and the responsible persons of the Party committees of the townships that came to support established a "700-Mu Full-Seedling Transplanting Command," under which there were three groups responsible for political mobilization, technical guidance, and life and hygiene, each with its own division of labor.

    All of the more than 3,000 cadres and masses who participated in this movement deeply realized that this was a great socialist collaboration and a good way to overcome natural disasters. Xie Xiaobi, the secretary of the Zengtai Township Branch, said: "Through this great collaboration, we have not only learned cotton seedling cultivation techniques, but also received collectivist education, setting a good example for future disaster resistance, production increase, and ensuring planning." Now, this labor army is fighting day and night! They must replace all the 700 mu of cotton fields with new and strong seedlings! (Yu Gongchang)

    帮助黄荆乡实现棉田增产规划
    沔阳县开展共产主义大协作
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：沔阳黄荆乡七百亩棉田通过邻近各兄弟乡支援棉苗和人力，移大苗换小苗工作，确保双千斤规划的实现。
    黄荆乡今年试办的七百多亩双千斤棉花高额丰产试验田，由于4月下旬遭到了一连二十多天的阴雨和两次寒潮、一次冰雹的灾害，造成棉田普遍缺苗，前后经过四次的补种和赶种，虽把苗补全了，可是苗长短不一，大的已经有了六片叶，小的还只刚出土，这样杂乱的棉苗，如何实现双千斤呢？重新种吧，季节过了；不种吧，棉苗损失太大，产量肯定不高。怎么办呢？乡党委会经过多次的研究、讨论、献计，和向保守思想作斗争的结果，决定采用移大苗换小苗的办法，来争取多结伏桃，确保双千斤规划实现。这一措施提出后，又碰到苗源缺乏和劳力不足两大困难。经过摸底算账的结果，七百亩棉田中，除本田互相调剂解决40％的棉苗外，还有60％的田共需二百万株棉苗无法解决；如果连移带栽每亩需工六十个，共需二万四千个工，相当于全乡总劳力八整天的劳动。面临着这样的困难是挺胸而出、战胜困难？还是畏难而退、向困难低头？黄荆乡党委和全乡人民选择了前面一条，在坚决办好七百亩双千斤，为全县争光荣的鼓舞下，终于作出了前人不敢想的移大苗换小苗的决议。他们相信：只要充分发动群众，依靠群众，和群众一道研究、想办法，没有战胜不了的困难。乡党委会将这决议和决心报告县委后，马上得到了县委的大力支持和鼓舞，立即从邻近的仙桃镇和长埫口区抽调机关干部、居民及农业社员二千多人进行支援，并号召和黄荆乡邻近的兄弟乡社在不影响本田全苗的原则下，向黄荆乡七百亩来一个献苗运动，黄荆乡八个农业社也抽出了一千二百个劳动力，配合突击五昼夜。在县委发出号召后，不到一天，仙桃镇和长埫口区二千多劳动大军，便自带箢、锹、锄头及棉苗营养钵赶到了黄荆乡，同黄荆乡社员一道投入移栽运动。远离五十多里的八潭乡，也组织了一百五十个劳动力，一次就给黄荆乡送来了六千多个营养钵，还准备继续支援五昼夜。前来支援的群众中，有人把送礼用的抬盒、菜篮、箩筐等各种用具都拿出来运棉苗，表现出了共产主义的新风格。
    为了珍惜这种共产主义的协作精神，不浪费一个劳力，并保证棉苗移栽质量，黄荆乡党委和前来支援的各乡党的负责人成立了“七百亩全苗移栽指挥部”，下设政治鼓动、技术指导、生活卫生三个小组，分工负责工作。
    所有参加这次运动的三千多干部和群众，都深深体会到这是社会主义的大协作，是战胜自然灾害的好办法。曾台乡支部书记解孝必说：“通过这次大协作，既学会了棉苗的栽培技术，又受了集体主义教育，为今后抗灾增产、确保规划树立了良好的榜样。”现在，这批劳动大军，正在夜以继日地紧张战斗！一定要使七百亩棉田全部换上新壮苗！　　　　　　　　（余功长）
