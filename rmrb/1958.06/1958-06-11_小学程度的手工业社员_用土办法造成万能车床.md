    Elementary School Level Handicraft Cooperative Members
    Use Indigenous Methods to Create Universal Lathe
    Li Xuemin and Liu Jianbin, two members of the Tianjin Fifth Machine Parts Cooperative with only elementary school educations, used wood and iron to make a locally-produced universal lathe suitable for rural farm tool repair shops. Using this lathe to make waterwheels is five times more efficient than using a regular six-foot lathe. This locally-produced universal lathe has a very simple structure, is inexpensive, and easy to operate, with only fifty-odd parts. The lathe body is made of wood, and the lathe weighs about a thousand catties, which is much lighter than a six-foot lathe. The steel used to make one six-foot lathe can make five such lathes. It can do turning, drilling, and milling; it can turn iron and also turn wood; it can make waterwheels, diesel engines, boiler-camel machines, and general iron and wood farm tool parts. In rural areas, it can be driven by boiler-camel machines, etc. Its shortcomings are that the speed is relatively low (one hundred and twenty revolutions), there is no lead screw, it cannot cut threads, and it cannot plane.

    小学程度的手工业社员
    用土办法造成万能车床
    天津市第五机器零件合作社两个只有小学文化程度的社员李学敏和刘建宾，用木料和铁制成了一台适合农村农具修配厂使用的土造万能车床。用这台车床做水车，效率比普通六呎车床高五倍。这种土造万能车床构造很简单，价钱便宜，操作方便，只有五十多个零件。车身是用木头做的，车床重一千斤左右，比六呎车床轻得多。做一台六呎车床所用的钢铁可以做五台这样的车床。它可以旋活、打眼和铣活；能旋铁，也能旋木头，可以做水车、柴油机、锅驼机和一般铁木农具零件。在农村里可以用锅驼机等带动。它的缺点是转速较低（一百二十转），没有丝杠，不能挑扣，不能刨活。
