    Talking About Fans
    Fan Fang
    "The fan creates a cool breeze, night after night swatting mosquitoes, if someone asks to borrow it, they have to wait until the autumn wind rises." Although the content of this old folk song is somewhat lacking in mutual assistance, it also illustrates that seasonal items are indispensable to everyone.
    The materials for fans are mostly sourced and woven locally. The more common ones currently include palm-leaf fans, bamboo fans, paper fans, oiled-paper fans, wheat-straw fans, and feather fans. There are also fans made of carved feathers or lightweight wood, which are more valuable and not often used.
    When did China have fans? It seems that very early on, when people were in the scorching heat of the sun, they would casually pick a large leaf and wave it to create a cool breeze, which was the earliest origin of fans. But to find the earliest record, there is only the "Zhou Li" which records the "shan fan" used on the king and queen's carriages. These were large, long-handled fans used to shield from wind and dust (hence the name "shielding fans"). Later, on either side of the thrones of feudal emperors and in the ceremonial guards of high officials in all dynasties, large shielding fans were used to show power and prestige. Fans are also often praised in Han and Tang poems, but only the names remain, and it is difficult to determine the materials and styles. A more clearly traceable origin is the folding fan. During the Xuanhe period of the Song Dynasty (around 1100 AD), the Korean kingdom (the ancient name for Korea) sent envoys to China, who presented folding fans as tribute. Also, Su Dongpo's articles mention: Korean white pine fans, which when unfolded are more than a foot wide, and when folded are only two fingers thick. Later, during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, Japan imported these fans in even greater quantities. In addition, there were also panel-shaped fans woven from bamboo strips, etc., and hung in the air to be pulled and swung to create wind, commonly called "Zhuge fans." In urban and rural shops without electric ceiling fans, this was mostly how wind was created, but now bamboo has been replaced by cloth.
    In some old poems and lyrics that praise objects, fans are often used to depict people's thoughts and feelings. For example, Ban Jieyu's "Song of Grievance" in the Han Dynasty uses the fan as a metaphor for women who were played with in feudal times, just like when autumn comes, they are out of season and discarded, "abandoned in boxes, affection cut off midway." Some types of fans were also used as tools to display status among the old intellectuals. In a certain place in Jiangsu, there was an old saying that looked down on labor: "Not waving a fan during Qingming, you look like a farmer." At this time, the spring chill has not yet dissipated, and the wind is still cold on the face, but they think that the earlier they do it, the more "refined" they can appear. In contrast to this, a powerful rebuttal to those idle classes is the folk song in "Water Margin": "The red sun is burning like fire, the rice in the fields is half withered and scorched, the farmer's heart is like soup boiling, and the sons of noble families wave their fans." It is not only full of anger, but also has a javelin-like satire.
    Now, most of the raw materials for making fans are plant stems and leaves. However, the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas still produce fine goods due to their traditional techniques, for export or for use by theatrical troupes. The varieties include round fans, palace fans, dance fans, folding fans, sandalwood fans, etc. Among them, the better round fans and palace fans have meticulous paintings and rich colors. The colorful handles are hung with tassels, which are very exquisite. Sandalwood fans are small and delicate, with intricate carvings. A gentle wave sends out fragrant breezes. Giving it to a friend is very pleasing.

    谈扇

    “扇子搧凉风，夜夜拍蚊虫，有人问我借，要等起秋风”这首旧山歌的内容，虽然有些缺乏互助精神，可是也说明了应时用品，人人脱不得手。
    扇子质料，大都就地取材编制。目前比较普通的有葵扇、竹扇、纸扇、油纸扇、麦杆扇、鹅毛扇等。其它还有用雕羽或轻质木材做的，比较名贵，不大常用。
    我国在什么时候有扇子的？似乎在很早的时候，人们在烈日炎暑当儿，随手摘瓣大叶，摇动取凉，就是扇子的最早起源了。可是要找最初记录，只有“周礼”上面记载王和后车上所用的“搧扇”。长柄大面，用来障蔽风尘的，（因此叫作障扇。）后来各代封建帝王宝座两旁，或高官出行的仪仗中，都用大障扇以表示威风。在汉唐诗歌中也常咏扇，可是只存名称，很难推详质料格式。比较有明确来历的，是折扇。宋宣和年间（公元1100年左右）高丽国（朝鲜古称）派使臣到中国，进贡折叠扇。又苏东坡文章中有：高丽白松扇，展之广尺许，合之止两指等语。后明代永乐年间，日本更大量输入这种扇子。另外有用竹篾等编成板形，挂在空中，牵荡取风的。俗叫“诸葛扇”。在没有电动吊扇的城乡店铺里，大都这样取风，不过现在已改竹为布了。
    一些咏物的旧诗词里，常用扇子来刻划人的思想感情。如汉代班婕妤的“怨歌行”。把扇来喻封建时代被玩弄的女性，好比到了秋天，过时落令，“捐弃箧笥中，恩情中道绝”了。有些扇种，在旧知识分子中，也作为表示身份的工具，江苏某地，有轻视劳动的两句老话：“清明不摇扇，像个种田汉”。这时春寒未消，扑面犹冷，而他们以为越占先着，越可显得“风雅”。同这对照，对那些有闲阶级予以有力反击的，要算“水浒传”中：“赤日炎炎似火烧，野田禾稻半枯焦，农夫心里如汤煮，公子王孙把扇摇”这首山歌了。它不仅充满了愤怒，而且具有投枪式的讽刺。
    现在大部分制扇原料，都用植物茎叶。但苏杭一带，因有技术传统，仍造细货，供外销或剧团应用。品种有团扇、宫扇、舞扇、折扇、檀香扇等。其中较好的团扇宫扇，描画工细，设色穠丽。彩柄垂缨，很是精美。檀香扇小巧玲珑，雕镂精致。一柄轻摇，香风四飘。把它赠给友人，很惹喜爱。
