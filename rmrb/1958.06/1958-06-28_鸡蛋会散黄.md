Why?

    Eggs Will Have Runny Yolks
    Fresh eggs have a transparent membrane—the yolk membrane—that tightly wraps the yolk, separating it from the egg white. The yolk membrane has three layers, the middle layer composed of carotene, and the other two of mucoprotein. When eggs are stored for a long time, some of the water from the egg white permeates through the yolk membrane into the yolk, causing the yolk to expand. The yolk membrane then becomes tense. Excessive tension, especially when stimulated by vibration, causes the membrane to rupture, and the yolk mixes with the egg white.
    The membrane of a fresh egg is supple and elastic, making it relatively strong. However, the yolk membrane of an old egg has lost much of its elasticity and is therefore less able to withstand the expansion of the yolk.
    Good eggs contain lysozyme in the egg white, which can resist bacterial invasion and kill bacteria that enter from the outside. But after an egg has a runny yolk, the yolk and egg white mix, and the lysozyme in the egg white loses its activity. As a result, bacteria have the opportunity to multiply rapidly inside the egg, causing it to spoil and emit a bad smell, making the egg inedible. (Ling)

专栏：为什么？

    鸡蛋会散黄
    新鲜的鸡蛋，有一层透明的薄膜——蛋黄膜，把蛋黄液紧紧裹住，使它和蛋白分开。蛋黄膜共有三层，当中的一层由葫萝卜素组成，其余两层则由粘蛋白组成。蛋贮放的时间久了，蛋白中的一部分水分就通过蛋黄膜，渗进蛋黄液中，蛋黄的体积因此膨胀，蛋黄膜就趋于紧张状态。紧张过度，特别是受到震动的刺激，膜就碎裂，蛋黄与蛋白就流在一起。
    新鲜鸡蛋的膜柔韧而富于弹性，所以比较坚固，但是陈蛋的蛋黄膜已很少弹性，所以更经不起蛋黄膨胀的作用。
    好的鸡蛋，蛋白里存有一种溶菌酶，可以抵抗细菌侵入，会把从外面进来的细菌歼灭掉。而鸡蛋散黄之后，蛋黄与蛋白相混，蛋白中的溶菌酶失去了活动力，结果细菌就有机会在蛋内很快繁殖，使蛋变质，发出一股臭味，这种蛋就吃不得了。　　（铃）
