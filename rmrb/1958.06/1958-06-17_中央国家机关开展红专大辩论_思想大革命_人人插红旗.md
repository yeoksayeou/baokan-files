Xinhua News Agency, June 16th. Central state organs, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, are launching a further Red and Expert Great Debate on the basis of a comprehensive "debate on emptiness," calling on everyone to plant red flags and launch a mass self-conscious ideological revolution movement. According to the planned schedule, this great debate is the last major step for the central state organs to win a complete victory in the rectification movement.

The mass heart-to-heart talks, sincere conversations, and Red and Expert debates are the main content of the fourth stage of the rectification movement.

Since the end of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party, all organs have universally conveyed the spirit of the meeting within the Party and among the masses. This transmission was an in-depth mobilization for the rectification movement, and many organs have redeployed the movement in accordance with the spirit of the meeting. Some organs have taken the spirit of the meeting as the guiding principle to further "debate on emptiness," liberating the thinking of leaders and the masses. Units that have completed the "debate on emptiness" have widely launched heart-to-heart talks and sincere conversations among the masses, and launched Red and Expert debates. As of the beginning of June, statistics show that 40% of the central state organs are conducting or have completed the Red and Expert debates, and the remaining 60% of the units are about to complete the "debate on emptiness."

Launching mass heart-to-heart talks, sincere conversations, and Red and Expert debates is regarded in central state organs as the main content and form of the fourth stage of the rectification movement. Because it takes the form of a vigorous mass self-conscious revolutionary movement, it enables all organs to complete the main tasks of the third stage of the rectification movement, and on the basis of the mass "debate on emptiness," to move smoothly to fully conclude the rectification movement with full revolutionary enthusiasm.

Three Steps of the Red and Expert Great Debate: Launch heart-to-heart talks and sincere conversations; launch a great debate on being both Red and Expert; conduct ideological summary.

The Red and Expert Great Debate in various organs mainly took three steps: First, universally launch heart-to-heart talks and sincere conversations. Publishing big-character posters is the main form of the heart-to-heart movement. People consciously used big-character posters to express their innermost thoughts to the Party based on their own circumstances, deeply exposing all their non-proletarian thoughts. In addition to publishing big-character posters, various organs also widely adopted individual talks, held seminars, and organized ideological exhibitions as ways to open their hearts. The mass heart-to-heart movement is another communist ideological liberation movement. Many organs posted tens of thousands of big-character posters of self-criticism and mutual criticism within a few days. This situation has pushed everyone into a self-conscious ideological revolution movement.

Secondly, on the basis of universal heart-to-heart talks, launch a great debate on being both Red and Expert. In the debate, some comprehensively criticized certain representative erroneous ideas, and some typical figures voluntarily gave reports to the masses and launched ideological debates. Because ideological awareness is a gradual process, heart-to-heart talks and debates are often repeated. Some organs have gone through heart-to-heart talks – debates – re-heart-to-heart talks – re-debates, and some have repeated this process as many as three times. Since the heart-to-heart movement is a self-conscious ideological revolution, all organs strictly followed the policy of handling contradictions among the people in the debate, that is, the policy of unity – criticism – unity, on the one hand, requiring the adoption of a gentle and rain-like approach, seeking truth from facts, persuading people with reason, allowing debate on different opinions, and also allowing individuals to reserve their opinions; on the other hand, insisting on distinguishing between right and wrong, and seriously carrying out criticism and self-criticism of erroneous ideas, so that communist ideology forms the mainstream.

The third step is ideological summary. Everyone writes a self-reflection ideological summary, formulates a personal Red and Expert leap forward plan, and clarifies the goals for future struggle. When conducting personal ideological examination and summary, some organs stipulate that all leading cadres, including ministers, must conduct it without exception. After the completion of this step of ideological summary, all the steps of the entire rectification movement will be largely completed.

After "debating on emptiness," after clarifying the general line of socialist construction, and after clarifying the specific construction direction and path of various industries, how to further liberate everyone's thinking, mobilize enthusiasm, and give play to the great role of the human factor through the Red and Expert Great Debate, this has great significance. The Party Committee of the central state organs believes that no matter what specific steps the central organs have taken, in the later stage of the rectification, "debating on emptiness" and "Red and Expert debate" are two indispensable steps that must be carried out without exception. The rectification cannot be ended without any one of them.

The main task at present is to solve the problem of "Red."

The situation in various organs shows that the current Red and Expert Great Debate mainly solves the problem of "Red." This is a struggle between two roads on the ideological front, and it is a more profound rectification movement. In heart-to-heart talks and debates, people exposed and criticized various erroneous views on the road of being both Red and Expert, such as the absolute contradiction between Red and Expert, the division of labor between Red and Expert, the theory of being Expert first and then Red, the theory of replacing Red with Expert, the theory of being only Expert, the theory of being pink, the theory of gilding, and the "interest theory" of Red and Expert, that is, those who are willing to be Expert are Expert, and those who are willing to be Red are Red, and so on. These various erroneous views are inseparable from each other, and the most fundamental problem is that intellectuals do not pay attention to ideological transformation, do not pay attention to the problem of "Red," and regard "Expert" as the only capital, thinking that it is a "rare commodity" and that having "Expert" means having what the Communist Party lacks most. Some engineering and technical personnel of the Ministry of Light Industry said in their heart-to-heart talks that in the past, they believed that "the Communist Party used my expertise, and giving me fame and fortune and status was my due reward." Since they regarded this as an "equal exchange," it is no wonder that some people admitted: "In the past, serving socialism was abstract, and my mind was full of personal fame and fortune calculations."

The difference in understanding between Red and Expert is manifested as the difference between bourgeois individualism and proletarian collectivism. The situation revealed in the heart-to-heart movement shows that bourgeois individualism has not yet been discredited. Many people believe that these two ideologies are legitimate and natural to "move forward on two tracks" under the socialist system. Some intellectual cadres in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and other units said that under the socialist system, individualism still has motivation and its positive role, saying that "the 'small motor' of individualism, plus the 'big motor' of socialism, when the two 'motors' are started together, the power will be greater"; saying that "individualism is nature, is instinct, is objectively existing, and cannot be eliminated"; some advocated: "Small and limited individualism should be allowed to exist legally." The purpose of these various erroneous arguments is to seek the legitimacy of individualism. Various organs seriously criticized this individualistic thinking in the debate. They shouted loudly to individualists, pointing out that the fundamental direction of bourgeois individualism is wrong, and the "small motor" is moving in the opposite direction to the "big motor." Not only is there no enthusiasm to speak of, but on the contrary, it will only offset the strength of building socialism.

"Middle ground" is the ideological root of bourgeois individualism.

In the debate, various organs further exposed and criticized the "middle ground" of bourgeois intellectuals. In the heart-to-heart talks, some intellectual cadres admitted that they were unwilling to strive for the upstream, but advocated "not left, not right, not forward, not backward, and strive for the middle reaches"; some said: "Take the middle of the three roads, and if it doesn't work, lean to the left"; some advocated "neither being a crane among chickens nor a chicken among cranes," "no great ambition in life, only seeking sixty points"; even some people believed: "The middle class has always been the majority, being in the middle is comfortable, there are predecessors and successors, and it is not isolated." Once these erroneous ideas were exposed, people automatically criticized them and found that their position had not been well resolved, and realized that the road of "gray experts" was really a dangerous road. People pointed out that "middle ground" is the ideological root of bourgeois individualism.

Resolutely break with the bourgeois "middle" road and move towards communism with light baggage.

The Red and Expert Great Debate is essentially a major break with the bourgeois "middle" road. In the debate, especially after conveying the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly encouraged and their ideological awareness was enlightened. Some said: "We can see communism in our generation, why not strive for the upstream and move forward with light baggage?" Some people automatically asked to be typical examples and requested to hold conferences for criticism and help; some arranged the materials revealed in their heart-to-heart movement into an ideological exhibition and acted as narrators themselves, with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry holding more than 120 such exhibitions. These narrators were respected and encouraged by the masses. More than 90 cadres in the Ministry of Coal Industry with relatively backward ideas have undergone significant changes after the Red and Expert debate; some who were considered the most backward "stubborn fortresses" in the past have now automatically opened their hearts and automatically carried out criticism. This situation even surprised many people. In the Ministry of Light Industry, some people wrote a poem to praise their happy mood after this ideological transformation: "Never have I felt so comfortable as today, never have I felt so cheerful as today, it is not that I have gained any treasure, it is really because I have given my heart to the Party."

### 中央国家机关开展红专大辩论  思想大革命　人人插红旗

    中央国家机关开展红专大辩论
    思想大革命　人人插红旗
    人们用诗表达思想改造后的愉快心情：“从来没有像今天这样心情舒畅，从来没有像今天这样情绪开朗，并不是我得到了什么宝贝，实在是因为我把心交给了党。”
    新华社16日讯　中央国家机关根据中共八大第二次会议的精神，在全面“论虚”的基础上，正在进一步掀起红专大辩论，号召人人插红旗，展开群众性的自觉思想革命运动。按照预定的计划，这次大辩论是中央国家机关争取整风运动全胜的最后一个重大步骤。
    群众性的交心、谈心和红专辩论，是整风运动第四阶段的主要内容。
    自从党的八大第二次会议结束以后，各机关普遍在党内和群众中传达了会议的精神，这次传达是对整风运动的一次深入动员，许多机关根据会议的精神，对运动重新作了部署。一部分机关以会议的精神为纲，进一步进行“论虚”，解放领导和群众的思想；已经“论虚”结束的单位，在群众中广泛地掀起了交心、谈心运动，展开了红专辩论。到6月上旬统计，中央国家机关内已有40％的单位正在进行或已经结束红专辩论，其余60％的单位“论虚”也即将结束。
    掀起群众性的交心、谈心运动和红专辩论，在中央国家机关内被当作整风运动第四阶段的主要内容和形式。由于是采取了轰轰烈烈的群众自觉革命运动的形式，这就使各机关在完成整风第三阶段的主要任务的基础上，在群众大“论虚”的基础上，顺流而下，以饱满的革命热情来全面结束整风运动。
    红专大辩论的三个步骤：开展交心、谈心运动；开展又红又专的大辩论；进行思想总结。
    各机关的红专大辩论主要采取了三个步骤：首先是普遍开展交心、谈心运动，出大字报是交心运动的主要形式，人们根据自己的情况，自觉地用大字报向党交心，深刻地揭露自己一切非无产阶级思想；除了出大字报以外，各机关还广泛地采用了个别谈心、举行座谈、举办思想展览等交心方式。群众性的交心运动，是又一次共产主义思想解放的运动，许多机关几天之内便贴出十几万张自我批评和相互批评的大字报，这种形势推动每一个人都卷入了自觉的思想革命运动。
    其次，在普遍交心的基础上，展开又红又专的大辩论。在辩论中，有的综合批判某些有代表性的错误思想，有的由典型人物自愿向群众作报告，展开思想辩论。由于思想觉悟是逐步提高的过程，交心和辩论常常是反复进行的，有的机关经过交心——辩论——再交心——再辩论，有的连续反复达三次之多。交心运动既然是自觉的思想革命，各机关在辩论中都严格地按照处理人民内部矛盾的方针，也就是团结——批评——团结的方针来进行辩论和批判，一方面要求采取和风细雨的方法，实事求是，以理服人，对不同的意见允许争辩，也允许保留个人意见；另一方面又坚持辨明是非，对错误的思想严肃地开展批评和自我批评，使共产主义思想形成主流。
    第三个步骤是思想总结，每个人写出自我反省的思想总结，订出个人红专跃进的规划，明确今后奋斗的目标。在进行个人思想检查和总结时，有的机关规定所有领导干部包括部长在内，都要无例外地进行。思想总结这个步骤完成以后，全部整风运动的步骤便大体完成。
    经过“论虚”，在明确了社会主义建设总路线以后，明确了各行各业具体的建设方向和道路以后，如何通过红专大辩论，进一步解放每个人的思想，调动积极性，发挥人的因素的伟大作用，这就有着重大的意义。中央国家机关党委认为，不管中央各机关采取了什么样的具体步骤，在整风的后期，“论虚”和“红专辩论”是两个不可逾越的、无例外都要进行的步骤，缺少任何一个都不能结束整风。
    当前主要是解决“红”的问题。
    各机关的情况表明，当前红专大辩论主要是解决“红”的问题，这是思想战线上两条道路的斗争，是更为深刻的整风运动。在交心和辩论中，人们揭露和批判了对又红又专道路的各种错误看法，例如红专绝对矛盾论，红专分工论，先专后红论，以专代红论，唯专论，粉红论，镀金论以及红专的“兴趣论”，即愿专者专，愿红者红，等等。这种种错误看法万变不离其宗，最根本的问题就是知识分子不重视思想改造，不重视“红”的问题，把“专”当作唯一的资本，以为“奇货可居”，有了“专”就有了共产党所最缺乏的东西。轻工业部有的工程技术人员在交心中就说，过去他认为“共产党是用我的专，给我名利和地位是我应得的报酬”。既然把这看作是“平等交易”，难怪有的人承认：“过去为社会主义服务是抽象的，满脑子装的还是个人名利打算”。
    对红和专认识上的分歧，表现为资产阶级个人主义思想同无产阶级集体主义思想的分歧。从交心运动中所揭露出的情况表明，至今资产阶级个人主义思想还并没有搞臭，许多人认为这两种思想在社会主义制度下“双轨前进”是合法的，是理所当然的事情。冶金工业部等单位有的知识分子干部就说，在社会主义制度下，个人主义还有动力，还有它的积极作用，说什么“个人主义的‘小马达’，加上社会主义的‘大马达’，两个‘马达’一齐开动，动力会更大”；说什么“个人主义是天性，是本能，是客观存在的，不可能消灭”；有的主张：“小小的、有限的个人主义应该允许其合法存在”。这种种错误论调，其目的是为了寻求个人主义的合法。各机关在辩论中严肃地批判了这种个人主义思想，他们向个人主义者大喊一声，指出资产阶级个人主义的根本方向错了，“小马达”是同“大马达”向着相反的方向前进的，不仅没有积极性可言，相反只会抵消建设社会主义的力量。
    “中间立场”是资产阶级个人主义的思想根源。
    各机关在辩论中，还进一步揭露和批判了资产阶级知识分子的“中间立场”。在交心中有的知识分子干部承认，他们不愿力争上游，而是主张“不左不右，不前不后，力争中游”；有的说：“三条路走中间，走不通向左偏”；有的主张“不做鹤中鸡，也不做鸡中鹤”，“平生无大志，只求六十分”；甚至有的人认为：“中间派历来总是多数，当中间心安理得，前有古人，后有来者，并不孤立”。这些错误思想一当揭露出来以后，人们自动进行了批判，发现原来自己的立场还并没有很好解决，醒悟到“灰色专家”的道路实在是危险的道路。人们指出，“中间立场”是资产阶级个人主义的思想根源。
    坚决同资产阶级“中间”道路决裂，轻装向共产主义前进。
    红专大辩论实质上是同资产阶级“中间”道路的一场大决裂。在辩论中，特别经过传达党的八大二次会议的精神以后，群众的情绪受到了巨大的鼓舞，启发了思想觉悟，有的说：“我们这一代就能看到共产主义，为什么还不力争上游轻装前进呢？”有的人自动要求做典型，请求召开大会进行批判帮助；有的把自己交心运动中所揭露出的材料，布置成思想展览会，并且自己现身说法，充当说明员，冶金部举办这样的展览会就有一百二十多个，这些说明员受到了群众的尊敬和鼓励。煤炭工业部有一百多个思想比较落后的干部，经过红专辩论，有九十多人有了显著的转变；有的过去认为是思想最落后的“顽固堡垒”，这次都自动交心，自动进行了批判，这种情况甚至使许多人都感到吃惊。在轻工业部，有的人写了这样一首诗来歌颂他们经过这次思想改造以后的愉快心情：“从来没有像今天这样心情舒畅，从来没有像今天这样情绪开朗，并不是我得到了什么宝贝，实在是因为我把心交给了党。”（附图片）
