Raise Industrial Production Levels to Support Agricultural Production

Nanjing Establishes Urban-Rural Production Technology Collaboration Network

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, June 13th) (Our reporter Zhang Jing reports:) Over one hundred large, medium, and small enterprises in Nanjing have established a comprehensive urban-rural production technology collaboration network. This collaboration network includes industry throughout the city, as well as agriculture, industry, and handicrafts in neighboring counties. Through comprehensive and long-term production and technology collaboration activities, the participating units in this collaboration network will greatly accelerate the improvement of industrial production levels and better support agricultural production.

This large collaboration network has four main collaboration lines, and activities are now actively underway in each line. The first collaboration line is for thirteen major machinery, chemical, and cement plants in the city to help the neighboring six counties of Jiangpu, Liuhe, etc., establish six agricultural machinery repair plants adapted to the needs of agriculture. One or two factories are responsible for one county, including providing equipment management cadres, the allocation and training of technical personnel, and undertaking major repair work of agricultural machinery in each county and district. At present, the factories are actively preparing to equip the six counties with sixty-three machine tools in the third quarter, and to train and allocate two hundred technical backbones and management personnel. The Party Committee Secretaries and factory directors of the Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Plant and the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant have personally gone to the counties to help study the design and arrange the preparatory work for the establishment of the plants, intending to basically establish the agricultural machinery repair plants in Lishui and Jurong counties before the end of June. In order to help the rapid development of county and township industries, the city has transferred twelve tons of medium carbon steel and pig iron, tens of tons of cement, and nearly ten thousand tons of various tools, parts, or miscellaneous equipment from its own urgently needed materials to fully support the counties in running industries. The counties have also fulfilled their obligations in supporting the city. Jiangning County supplied 200 tons of newly smelted pig iron to Nanjing; Jurong County supplied bauxite ore to Nanjing as a raw material for refractory materials; and Liuhe County will also supply a large amount of various vegetables to support the industrial construction of Dachang Town. This fixed collaboration between factories and counties will greatly promote the accelerated development of urban and rural industry and agriculture.

The second collaboration line is organized by large, medium, and small enterprises in the city's major industries. They will collaborate according to product series, adopting the method of large enterprises leading small ones, the combination of small and large, and "mother hen laying eggs" to carry out product division of labor, organize exchanges of production technology experience, and solve daily collaboration problems between each other. At present, the city has compiled ten "braids" according to industrial nature, including machine tool manufacturing, electrical machinery, instrument manufacturing, telecommunications, agricultural machinery, shipbuilding, mining, ceramics, chemicals, and textiles. Each "braid" has a designated core factory taking the lead, responsible for the planning of the industry. Large factories with thousands of people and small repair groups with three or four people have been organized, which facilitates the adjustment of technical forces and the balancing of product distribution within the city, and gives fuller play to the potential and role of existing industries.

The third collaboration line is to organize relevant old factories to be responsible for the construction of several major new projects in the city. These old factories are to be fully responsible from design, construction, and installation to putting them into production, including the allocation and training of management cadres and technical personnel, as well as technical guidance after putting them into production. For example, the Yongli Ning Plant, which has a long history, is now preparing for the construction of new small-scale fertilizer and sulfuric acid plants, which can greatly accelerate the progress of new construction projects.

The fourth collaboration line is to organize a comprehensive technical collaboration among the city's technical forces for several new products with relatively complex technologies, in order to accelerate the trial production process of these new products, ensure that they are put into production as early as possible, and improve the city's industrial production level through this technical collaboration. Recently, more than twenty machinery factories in Nanjing are working together to trial-produce two sets of 750 kW steam turbines to support agricultural electrification. The technical requirements for this type of steam turbine are relatively high, and Nanjing has never done it before. If one factory or a few factories were to undertake it, it would be impossible to complete. Building a professional steam turbine factory would take several years and a lot of funds. Therefore, organizing relevant factories and technical forces in the city to work together has become the only effective way to implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. This 750 kW steam turbine is now under intense trial production. The workers of more than twenty machinery factories and other collaborating units are determined to complete it before October to offer a gift to National Day.

    提高工业生产水平  支援农业生产
    南京建立城乡生产技术协作网
    本报南京13日电  本报记者张竞报道：南京市的一百多个大、中、小型企业，已经建立了全面的城乡生产技术协作网。这个协作网包括全市工业和邻县农业、工业、手工业。参加这一协作网的各单位，通过全面长期的生产、技术协作活动，将要大大加速工业生产水平的提高，更好地支援农业生产。
    这个大协作网有四条主要协作线，现在各条线都已积极展开了协作活动。第一条协作线是全市十三个主要的机械、化工和水泥厂帮助邻县江浦、六合等六个县建立六个适应农业需要的农业机械修配厂。由一个或两个厂包干一个县，包括提供设备管理干部、技术人员的配备、培训和承担各县、区农业机械大修理业务。现在各工厂已积极准备在第三季度内为六个县配齐六十三部机床，培养和配备二百个技术骨干和管理人员。汽车制配厂、南京机床厂的党委书记和厂长都亲自到县里去，帮助研究设计和安排建厂的筹备工作，打算提前在6月底以前把溧水、句容两个县的农业机械修配厂基本上建立起来。为了帮助县乡工业迅速发展，全市又从自己迫切需要的物资中，调出中炭钢和元铁十二吨、水泥数十吨，以及各种工具、零件或零星器材近万吨，全力支援各县办工业。各县在支援城市方面也尽了义务。江宁县将自己新冶炼的二百吨生铁，供应了南京市；句容县提供铝矾土矿石供应南京市作耐火材料的原料；六合县也将大量供应各种蔬菜，支援大厂镇工业建设。这种厂和县之间的固定协作，将大大促进城乡工农业的加速发展。
    第二条协作线是全市主要产业的大、中、小企业组织起来的。他们将按系列产品进行协作，采取以大带小，小、大结合，“母鸡生蛋”的办法，进行产品分工，组织生产技术的经验交流，解决互相之间日常协作的问题。现在全市按产业性质已经编成机床制造、电机、仪表制造、电讯、农业机械、造船、采掘、陶瓷、化学、纺织等十条“辫子”，每条“辫子”，都指定一个核心工厂挂帅，负责该产业的规划。大自几千人的大厂，小至三、四个人的修理小组，都被组织进来，这就便于在全市范围内调整技术力量、平衡产品布局，更充分地发挥现有工业的潜力和作用。
    第三条协作线是组织有关老厂包建全市几项主要的新建项目。这些老厂要从设计、施工、安装一直到投入生产，连同管理干部、技术人员配备、培训以及投入生产后的技术指导等全部负责包干到底。如有着悠久历史的永利宁厂现在正在为新建的小型化肥厂与硫酸厂进行筹备工作，这就可以大大加速新建项目的进度。
    第四条协作线是对几种技术比较复杂的新产品，组织全市技术力量进行全面的技术协作，以加快这些新产品的试制过程，保证及早投入生产，并且通过这种技术上的协作，提高全市工业生产水平。最近，南京市二十多个机械工厂，正在通力协作试制两套七百五十瓩汽轮机，支援农业电气化。这种汽轮机技术要求较高，南京市过去从来没有做过，如果由一个工厂或几个工厂来承担，是不可能完成的，而建造一个专业的汽轮机厂，需要几年的时间和很多资金。因此组织全市有关工厂和技术力量通力协作，就成了贯彻多、快、好、省方针的唯一有效的办法，现在这部七百五十瓩的汽轮机正在紧张试制，二十多个机械工厂和其他协作单位的职工，决心争取在10月以前完成，向国庆献礼。
