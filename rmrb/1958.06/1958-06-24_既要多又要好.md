The reason for the low quality of some agricultural tools is multifaceted. A relatively common reason is that since the high tide of agricultural production, the demand for agricultural machinery has greatly increased. Although the production capacity of agricultural tool factories has grown, it still cannot meet the needs. Under such circumstances, the contradiction between quantity and quality arises.

In the view of some people, since the demand for agricultural machinery is so large, it is difficult to guarantee quality. This old idea, which was refuted long ago, has been revived. Such reasoning cannot stand its ground under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, because so many facts have shown that as long as people's enthusiasm and creativity are mobilized, and they go all out and aim high, it is entirely possible to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

After all, there are contradictions between quantity and quality, and between demand and production, under certain conditions. To solve this problem, in addition to having the comprehensive concept of more, faster, better, and more economical results mentioned above, we must also pay great attention to the current technical innovation movement in enterprises. Mobilizing the masses to reform tools and improve technology will not only increase production but also ensure quality, as long as we earnestly launch a mass technical innovation movement.

Today, this newspaper published two letters from readers criticizing the irresponsible attitude of the Chaoyang County Farm Tool Factory and other factories towards their products. This is a problem worth noting, and it is not very difficult to solve. As long as we use the spirit of the General Line to examine our work and try every means to come up with measures to improve quality, the problem can be solved.

### 既要多又要好

    既要多又要好
    某些农具质量不高的原因是多方面的。比较普遍的是：农业生产高潮以来，农用机械的需要量大大地增加，农具制造厂的生产能力虽有增长，但是，仍然不能满足需要，在这样的情况下，数量和质量的矛盾就出现了。
    在某些人看来，农用机械需要量既然很大，就很难保证质量，这个很久以前就遭到否定的老观念又复活了。这种道理，在大跃进的形势下，更无法站住脚了，因为许许多多的事实都说明，只要把人的积极性、创造性动员起来，鼓足干劲，力争上游，既多快又好省是完全可以办到的。
    毕竟数量和质量、需要与生产之间，在一定的条件下，还是有矛盾的。要解决这个问题，除了上面所说的要有全面的多快好省的观念以外，还必须十分重视当前企业中的技术革新运动。发动群众改革工具、改进技术，只要认真地把群众性的技术革新运动发动起来，不仅能提高产量，而且也能保证质量。
    今天本报发表了两件读者来信，批评朝阳县农具厂等工厂对产品不够负责的态度。这是值得引起注意的问题，也不是十分难以解决的问题，只要我们用总路线的精神来检查自己的工作，千方百计地想出改进质量的措施，问题是能够解决的。
