    Algerian Communist Party Secretary Bouhali
    Condemns De Gaulle's Extreme Colonialist Policy
    National Liberation Front Refuses Elections in Algeria
    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: According to a dispatch from the Czechoslovak News Agency in Cairo on June 7th: Algerian Communist Party Secretary, Rabah Bouhali, made a statement regarding De Gaulle's speech in Algiers on the 4th.
    Bouhali said that De Gaulle's first speech in Algeria completely confirmed that he is absolutely consistent with the policies and strategies of extreme colonialism and the Algerian rebel generals, and he is the inspirer of these generals.
    Bouhali pointed out that the (French) new Prime Minister's position in Algeria means practically declaring a total war against the Algerian people.
    Bouhali said: "However, especially after the Tangier conference, it is very clear that the Algerian problem cannot be solved in isolation. As the resolutions passed at that conference show, the Algerian problem cannot be solved in any other way except within the framework of the Maghreb Union (referring to the three North African countries). This means that De Gaulle's stance against the Algerian people is also against the brotherly people of Tunisia and Morocco. Therefore, this also means that there is a danger of the war spreading to the entire North Africa. The colonialist fascists who are emerging in Algeria are far from weakening the offensive power of the Algerian National Liberation Army; on the contrary, it has inspired this offensive power. De Gaulle will soon know how our people will respond to his June 4th declaration. Our people will further strengthen their liberation struggle, because they know that they can rely on the firm support of the brotherly people of Tunisia and Morocco and the support of all progressive forces in the world fighting for freedom, democracy and peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 7th: A spokesman for the Algerian National Liberation Front said on the evening of the 6th: "The National Liberation Front and the Algerian people resolutely reject De Gaulle's proposal to hold elections in Algeria. Only after Algeria gains independence and is free from shameful colonial rule can such elections be held."
    The Algerian National Liberation Front spokesman condemned the colonialist policies outlined by De Gaulle in a radio address broadcast on Cairo Radio. He said: "It is not surprising that such words come from a man whose relationship with the Algerian people is filled with violence and hatred. Isn't it De Gaulle who massacred thousands of compatriots in 1954 and imprisoned and sent thousands more to concentration camps?"
    The spokesman said in a talk broadcast on Cairo Radio: "But the Algerian revolution will continue. It will drive De Gaulle away, just as it has driven away De Gaulle's predecessors. Despite De Gaulle and all colonialists, the Algerian people will surely achieve independence."
    Algerian National Liberation Front leader Abbas arrived in Cairo on the 6th to attend the Algerian National Liberation Front Liaison and Executive Committee meeting. He told reporters: "The National Liberation Front will not accept any imperialist solution imposed on Algeria by France, no matter how deceptive this solution may be." He said: "The only solution acceptable to the National Liberation Front is the unconditional recognition of Algeria's independence."
    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: Algiers dispatch: When De Gaulle delivered a speech in Oran, Algeria's second largest city, on the 6th, he proclaimed in a completely colonialist tone that Algeria "is today French territory and will always be French territory." In his speech, he also indicated his attempt to change the French state system. He expressed the expectation that after a national referendum to be held within three months, a "new system" would emerge in France.

    阿尔及利亚共产党书记布哈利
    指斥戴高乐极端殖民主义政策
    民族解放阵线拒绝在阿尔及利亚选举
    据新华社7日讯　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社开罗7日消息：阿尔及利亚共产党书记拉比·布哈利就戴高乐4日在阿尔及尔发表的演讲，发表了谈话。
    布哈利说，戴高乐在阿尔及利亚发表的第一次演讲完全证实他跟极端殖民主义的和阿尔及利亚叛乱将军们的政策和战略是绝对一致的，他就是这些将军的鼓舞者。
    布哈利指出（法国）新总理在阿尔及利亚所采取的立场意味着实际上宣布对阿尔及利亚人民进行全面的战争。
    布哈利说：“但是，特别在丹吉尔会议以后，事情很明显，阿尔及利亚问题不能孤立地解决。像那次会议所通过的决议所表明的，阿尔及利亚问题除了在马格里布联盟（指北非三国）的范围以内解决外，是不能以其他任何方式解决的。这意味着，戴高乐所采取的反对阿尔及利亚人民的立场也是反对突尼斯和摩洛哥的兄弟人民的。因此，这也就意味着战争有蔓延到全北非的危险。在阿尔及利亚抬头的殖民主义法西斯主义分子远没有削弱阿尔及利亚民族解放军的进攻力量，恰恰相反，它却激励了这种进攻力量。戴高乐很快就会知道我们的人民将怎样回答他6月4日的宣言。我们的人民将进一步加强他们的解放斗争，因为他们知道，他们可以依靠突尼斯和摩洛哥兄弟人民的坚决的支持和全世界为自由、民主与和平而斗争的一切进步力量的支持。”
    据新华社开罗7日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线发言人6日晚上说：“民族解放阵线和阿尔及利亚人民断然拒绝戴高乐所提出的在阿尔及利亚举行选举的建议。只有阿尔及利亚获得独立和摆脱可耻的殖民统治以后，才能举行这种选举。”
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的发言人在开罗电台发表的广播谈话中谴责了戴高乐所概述的殖民主义政策。他说：“这种话出自一个和阿尔及利亚人民的关系中充满了暴力和憎恨的人是不足为奇的。1954年时屠杀了成千的同胞，另外把成千的同胞关进监狱和集中营去的人难道不就是戴高乐吗？”
    这位发言人在开罗电台发表的谈话中说：“但是，阿尔及利亚的革命将不断进行下去。它将把戴高乐赶走，就像赶走戴高乐的历届前任一样。尽管有戴高乐和一切殖民主义者，阿尔及利亚人民一定会取得独立。”
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领袖阿巴斯6日到达开罗出席阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线联络与执行委员会会议。他对新闻记者说：“民族解放阵线不会接受法国强加于阿尔及利亚的任何帝国主义的解决办法，不论这种办法是多么迷惑人。”他说：“民族解放阵线能够接受的唯一的解决办法是无条件地承认阿尔及利亚的独立。”
    据新华社7日讯　阿尔及尔消息：戴高乐6日在阿尔及利亚的第二大城市阿兰发表演说时，用十足殖民主义的口吻宣扬说，阿尔及利亚“今天是法国的土地，而且永远是法国的土地”。他在演讲中还表明他企图改变法国的国家体制。他表示期望在三个月内举行的全民投票之后，法国将要出现一种“新制度”。
