Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 4th: According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Free Lebanon" radio station, a Lebanese opposition figure announced on the 3rd, after a meeting of leaders of various opposition parties, that the opposition parties still insist that Chamoun and the current government resign, and demand the removal of those traitors who serve the Eisenhower Doctrine. The radio station said that the opposition leaders who attended the meeting included three former prime ministers: Saeb Salam, Abdallah Yafi, Hussein Oweini, the leftist leader of the Socialist Progressive Party, Nassim Majdalani, the cleric Muhammad Abu Shaqra, and Abdallah Maharu.

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Lebanese National Front issued a statement on the 3rd, pointing out that the strike cannot be stopped simply because the current Prime Minister Solh has promised not to amend the constitution.

Recently, the pro-Western ruling clique in Lebanon, under the instructions of imperialists, is plotting a political conspiracy, attempting to use the method of partially replacing members of the current ruling group to divide the opposition parties, deceive the people, and stifle the struggle of the broad masses of the people against imperialism and in defense of national independence.

    黎巴嫩各反对党领袖
    坚持要亲西方政府辞职
    据新华社大马士革4日电　据“自由黎巴嫩之声电台”广播，黎巴嫩一位反对党人士3日在各反对党派领袖举行了会议之后宣布，各反对党派仍然坚持要夏蒙和现政府辞职，并且要求清除那些为艾森豪威尔主义效劳的卖国贼。电台说，参加这次会议的反对党派领袖包括三位前总理：赛义卜·萨拉姆、阿卜杜拉·雅非、侯赛尼·乌埃尼，社会主义进步党左翼领袖纳西姆·马吉达兰尼，穆罕默德·阿布·沙克拉教长和阿卜杜拉·马哈鲁夫。
    据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩民族阵线3日发表声明，指出不能因为现总理索勒哈答应不修改宪法而停止罢工。
    最近以来，黎巴嫩亲西方统治集团在帝国主义者指使下，正在策划一项政治阴谋，企图用部分更换目前统治集团成员的手法来分化反对党，欺骗人民，扼杀广大人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的斗争。
