    Overseas Chinese Youth in the Motherland's Frontier
    More than 300 returned overseas Chinese students have begun a happy agricultural labor life on state-owned farms and experimental farms in various autonomous prefectures on the Yunnan frontier. These students are high school or junior high school graduates who returned from countries such as Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, Thailand, and Japan. In the great leap forward of the motherland, they voluntarily gave up their plans to pursue higher education and actively requested to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    华侨青年在祖国边疆
    三百多名归国华侨学生在云南边疆各自治州的国营农场和试验场开始了愉快的农业劳动生活。这批学生都是从印度尼西亚、缅甸、越南、马来亚、泰国和日本等国回来的高中或初中毕业生。在祖国大跃进声中，他们自动放弃了升学的打算，积极要求参加祖国的社会主义建设。
