Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th: June 14th marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the China Welfare Institute by Mr. Soong Ching Ling, the eminent fighter for peace. On that day, in addition to holding a grand celebration, the China Welfare Institute will also publish a commemorative album and picture album, and hold an exhibition.

The commemorative album "Twenty Years of the China Welfare Institute" contains inscriptions by Premier Zhou Enlai and special articles by Mr. Soong Ching Ling and Comrade Dong Biwu, as well as articles by Liao Chengzhi, Kang Keqing, Xiao San, Wu Yunfu, and others. It also includes commemorative articles by international friends such as Israel Epstein and Rewi Alley. They record the outstanding contributions made by the China Welfare Institute under the leadership of Vice-Chairman Soong over the past twenty years to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution.

The first page of the "Picture Album" features a photo of Mr. Soong Ching Ling with children. The children look so happy and joyful in front of their kind Mother Soong. The picture album also introduces the work and development of units such as kindergartens, nurseries, children's palaces, and the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital.

The China Welfare Institute's 20th Anniversary Exhibition, held in Shanghai, showcases the progressive spirit and peace-keeping achievements of the China Welfare Institute over the past twenty years.

With the rapid advancement of our country's socialist construction, the work of the China Welfare Institute has also greatly developed. It currently has seven institutions: the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, nurseries, kindergartens, children's palaces, children's art theater, the "Children's Era" magazine, and the "China Reconstructs" (English monthly) magazine. From this exhibition, it can be seen that these units of the China Welfare Institute are playing a leading role in women and children's health care, in educating and cultivating children's communist morality, and in enriching children's cultural and artistic lives.
