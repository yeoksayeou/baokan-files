　　Scientific Production Flies Wing to Wing
　　Bai Sheng
　　Researching and solving the new problems raised in the Great Leap Forward in production, and close cooperation with production units, is the correct direction for scientific research in universities and colleges, and it is also a good start for professors and scientists to move from their studies to practice. Doing so will bring a new atmosphere to scientific research in universities and colleges.
　　Socialist production is undergoing a Great Leap Forward, urgently requiring improved production technology and technological revolution. How can the strength of the scientific and technological force in universities and colleges be brought into play, how can it adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, and further promote the development of technological innovation? This has become a very important issue.
　　We know that science comes from production practice. The Great Leap Forward in socialist production has created conditions for the great development of science, and the development of science has further promoted and guided production practice.
　　After the rectification and anti-rightist movement, the teachers of Shanghai's universities and colleges have made ideological leaps, and therefore have a better ideological foundation for accepting the principle of science serving the Great Leap Forward in production. They not only trial-produced various new products for production departments, but also directly carried out design, surveying, construction, and even installation and processing work for many production departments, so that the scientific and technological difficulties encountered by production departments in the current Great Leap Forward were solved in a timely manner. Scientific research serving production is also the best way to help teachers transform their thinking. Many professors and scientists have long been subjected to bourgeois education that is divorced from reality. They lack experience in production practice and also have the idea of one-sidedly emphasizing theory, neglecting practice, neglecting labor, and pursuing "science for science's sake." At the same time, they are only accustomed to individual work, detached from production, detached from reality, isolated in a corner, and working behind closed doors, which inevitably affects the leap forward in science and technology. The establishment of cooperative relationships and participation in production practice have brought into play the spirit of collectivism, profoundly changed people's ideological outlook, and also changed the cooperative relationships within the school. They compared this change in relationship to the production relations in rural areas, from individual farming to mutual aid teams, and then to cooperatives. This is also a gratifying gain.
　　We see that when scientific research is oriented towards production and serves production, the content of research comes from production practice, and the results of research are applied to production practice. In this way, coming from production and going to production, science and technology and production construction will fly wing to wing and make leaps forward together.
　　Now, the correct direction of scientific research has begun to be established, and it will bring infinitely beautiful prospects for the Great Leap Forward in socialist production construction and scientific research!

　　科学生产比翼而飞

    研究和解决生产大跃进中提出来的各项新问题，密切同生产单位协作，这是高等学校开展科学研究工作的正确的方向，也是教授和科学家从书斋走向实践的一个良好的开端。这样做，将给高等学校的科学研究工作带来新的气象。
    社会主义生产正在大跃进，迫切需要提高生产技术，进行技术革命。而高等学校的这支科学技术大军的力量如何发挥，如何适应生产大跃进的形势，进一步促使技术革新工作的开展，就成为十分重要的一个课题。
    我们知道，科学来自生产实践，社会主义生产大跃进，给科学的大发展创造了条件，而科学的发展又进一步推动和指导了生产实践。
    上海高等学校的教师们经过了整风、双反运动，思想上有了跃进，因此在接受科学为生产大跃进服务的方针上就有了较好的思想基础。他们不单为生产部门试制了各种新产品，而且还直接为许多生产部门进行设计、绘测、建筑以至安装、加工等工作，使生产部门在当前大跃进中的一些科学技术上的困难问题及时获得了解决。科学研究为生产服务，对教师来说，也正是帮助他们进行思想改造的最好的办法。许多教授、科学家，长期受的是资产阶级的脱离实际的教育，既缺乏生产实践的经验，又存在片面强调理论，轻视实践、轻视劳动、为“科学而科学”的思想。同时，他们只习惯于个人单干，脱离生产、脱离实际，孤处一隅、闭门造车的作法，这必然影响科学技术的跃进。而协作关系的建立，参加生产实践，就发挥了集体主义的精神，深刻地改变了人们的思想面貌，也改变了校内的协作关系。他们把这种关系的改变比喻成为如农村的生产关系，由单干到互助组，再到合作社一样。这也是一个可喜的收获。
    我们看到，当科学研究工作面向生产为生产服务以后，研究的内容来自生产实践，研究的成果又应用于生产实践，这样从生产中来到生产中去，科学技术和生产建设就将比翼而飞，双双跃进。
    现在，正确的科学研究方向已开始树立，它将给社会主义生产建设和科学研究的跃进带来无限美好的前程！
