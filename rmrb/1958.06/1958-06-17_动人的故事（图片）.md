A Touching Story
    This is the touching story of a Soviet doctor's emergency rescue of a Chinese rural woman in labor. At 2:00 PM on May 9th, Soviet border guards in Borzya on the Amur River (Soviet people call the Heilongjiang River the Amur River) received an urgent distress call. In the village of Xiabacha (transliteration) on the Chinese side of the Amur River, a woman named Dong Guifu (transliteration) was dying from premature labor, and the village was unable to provide emergency care. The Soviet border guards immediately notified Borzya to send a helicopter for rescue. The left picture shows helicopter pilot A. Arsenenkov (right) and assistant physician of the Borzya Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital setting off to pick up the patient.

    动人的故事
    这是苏联医生急救我国一个农村产妇的故事。五月九日在下午二点钟的时候，苏联在伯力阿穆尔河（苏联人把黑龙江叫阿穆尔河）畔的苏联边防战士接到了一个紧急求救的警报。在阿穆尔河对岸的中国夏巴查（译音）村庄里有个叫董贵福（译音）的妇女因早产濒于死亡，乡村中无法对她进行急救。苏联边防的战士们立刻通知伯力派直升飞机前往救护。左图为直升飞机驾驶员阿·阿尔谢年科夫（右）和苏联伯力中央妇产科医院助理医师启程去接病人。
