Enhance the Status of Sweet Potatoes
Commentator of this Newspaper

In the past, sweet potatoes seemed to many people to be just a coarse food for filling the stomach, not worthy of being considered a staple food. Some even believed that "eating more sweet potatoes means less nutrition" and were not interested in eating them.

Is this really the case? The news item about the Southern Sweet Potato Conference published in this newspaper today answers this question by affirming that sweet potatoes are a highly nutritious food. According to tests, sweet potatoes contain all the nutrients found in indica rice. Every 100 grams of sweet potatoes contains 2.3 grams of protein, 0.2 grams of fat, 29 grams of carbohydrates, 0.5 grams of crude fiber, 0.8 grams of ash, 18 milligrams of calcium, 20 milligrams of phosphorus, and 0.4 milligrams of iron. These are all essential nutrients for the human body. Sweet potatoes are not only a nutritious staple food but also inexpensive, delicious, and versatile. In terms of consumption and cooking, they can be steamed, boiled, fried, or roasted, and can be made into a variety of delicious dishes with sour, salty, sweet, and spicy flavors to entertain distinguished guests. In terms of comprehensive utilization, sweet potatoes can be used as raw materials for many industries, and the remaining sweet potato residue can be used to feed livestock. From the roots to the stems and leaves, there is no waste. In short, it is of great significance for developing industry, animal husbandry, increasing farmers' income, and improving their lives. In fact, in China's concentrated sweet potato producing areas, farmers have always cultivated it as a staple food, with some even accounting for about 50% of their annual food ration. If farmers can eat it, why can't urban people eat it as a staple food? Nutritional analysis shows that it can be used as a staple food for people, especially in China's current situation where food is not abundant. It is entirely appropriate and feasible to educate people in areas that do not produce or produce few sweet potatoes to eat some sweet potatoes. The notion that sweet potatoes cannot be a staple food and are monotonous is essentially a matter of ideology, habit, and cooking skills. People's subjective initiative changes with the material base. As long as everyone's ideological understanding is improved, other problems will be easily solved.

This year, farmers in various regions have been very enthusiastic about producing sweet potatoes, and the planting area has expanded by 50% to two or three times. According to the planned output of ten provinces, including Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, it is estimated to increase by more than double compared to last year. If calculated in terms of rice, it accounts for about 11% of the total national grain output, which is of great significance for improving China's food situation. However, at present, many people in society and in the grain system do not fully recognize the significance of developing sweet potato production. Some grain work cadres approach the issue of managing sweet potatoes purely from a business perspective, focusing more on the temporary difficulties existing in processing, storage, and transportation technologies, without considering the issue from the perspective of China's 600 million people. Therefore, in terms of business ideology, there are three fears: fear of trouble, fear of losing money, and fear of responsibility, so they are not actively engaged in sweet potato management. On the other hand, there is also a tendency of only managing purchasing and sales, not managing production, only caring about the state, and not caring about the masses. From the farmers' perspective, sweet potatoes have been planted, but some people have some doubts about planting so many sweet potatoes this year, that is, whether sweet potatoes can really be used as a substitute for grain? They fear that the state will purchase less, affecting their own living arrangements, etc. If these doubts are not resolved in a timely manner, it will inevitably affect the next step of sweet potato cultivation and fertilization, thereby affecting the realization of the sweet potato production increase plan. The Ministry of Food held the Southern Sweet Potato Conference in Changsha City to arrange and solve the management of sweet potatoes early, and to promote production by expanding purchasing and sales, which is very timely. The above situation shows that actively expanding the management of sweet potatoes is not only an economic task but also an important political task, which is of great significance for improving China's current food situation, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and building socialism.

Of course, we cannot fail to see the objective difficulties that currently exist in the management of sweet potatoes in terms of processing, storage, transportation, and consumption. However, as long as everyone exerts enough effort and thinks of more ways, these difficulties can be overcome. Sweet potatoes have a long history in China and are widely distributed. Farmers in many areas eat sweet potatoes all year round. If farmers can store them well, can't we? The key is whether we are willing to do it. If we are willing to do it, we will find a way. If we are not willing to do it, there will never be a way. Hunan and some other provinces and cities have already made some efforts in the management of sweet potatoes, and have created many experiences in terms of consumption, storage, and processing. Currently, many restaurants in the Hunan market have made more than 100 kinds of sweet potato foods for sale, which are very popular among consumers.

To enhance the status of sweet potatoes and make everyone happy to eat them is not simply a matter of changing habits, but a technical reform issue of cooking and processing. All regions should attach importance to this work, cultivate a few models in a planned way, and produce "diverse, beautiful, nutritious, inexpensive, and hygienic" sweet potato foods to open up avenues for expanding sweet potato consumption. At present, many urban people still lack the habit of eating sweet potatoes and still have some ideological concerns. How to establish the status of sweet potatoes among these people is still an important task on the ideological front. At the same time, to manage sweet potatoes well, it is not enough to rely solely on the grain department. It is necessary to closely cooperate with other relevant departments and arrange them uniformly under the leadership of the local Party committee. For example, industrial departments, especially local industries, should actively design and manufacture various mechanical tools that can save labor, improve efficiency, are easy to operate, are inexpensive, and are suitable for decentralized processing in rural areas, as well as study drying methods suitable for rural use to help agricultural cooperatives solve the difficulties of large-scale processing and prevent spoilage. Transportation departments should sum up their existing experience as soon as possible to achieve fast loading and transportation so that sweet potatoes are not damaged. As long as everyone works together and earnestly implements the central government's instructions on actively managing sweet potatoes and makes various concrete preparations as soon as possible, our sweet potato management work will surely be greatly advanced.

    要提高红薯的身价
    本报评论员
    过去，红薯在人们心目中似乎只是一种粗糙果腹的东西，不能攀登主粮的大雅之堂，有的还认为“多吃红薯少营养”，对吃红薯不感兴趣。
    是不是真的如此呢？本报今天刊登的南方薯类会议这条新闻，就对这个问题作出了答复，肯定红薯是一种营养价值很高的食物。据化验，凡属籼米所有的养分，红薯都有，每一百克红薯中含有蛋白质二点三克，脂肪零点二克，碳水化合物二十九克，粗纤维零点五克，灰份零点八克，钙十八毫克，磷二十毫克，铁零点四毫克，这些都是人身体上必需的营养成分。红薯不单是一种富有营养的主粮，而且价廉物美、鲜甜可口，用途也比较广泛。在食用烹调上，可以蒸、煮、炸、烤，能做出酸、咸、甜、辣各种各样味道的美酒佳肴，招待贵宾。在综合利用方面，红薯可作许多种工业的原料，剩下的薯渣还可喂牲畜，从薯根到茎、叶都没有一点废物。总之，它对发展工业、畜牧业，增加农民收入、改善生活，都有着重要的意义。其实在我国红薯集中产区，农民一向把它作为主粮种植，有的甚至占全年口粮的50％左右，农民可以吃，难道城市人民就不能作为主粮吃用吗？从营养分析说明，它能作为人吃的主食粮种，特别是在我国目前粮食还不宽裕的情况下，教育不产或少产薯类地区人民吃些红薯也是完全应该的，可以行得通的。所谓红薯不能当主粮、单调乏味，实质上是一个思想、习惯和烹调使用技术问题。人的主观能动力是随着物质基础变化的，只要大家思想认识提高了，其他问题就会迎刃而解。
    今年，各地农民生产红薯积极性很高，红薯种植面积扩大50％到二、三倍，仅据湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、江西、浙江、四川、云南、贵州等十个省的计划产量估计，就比去年增加一倍多，如以稻谷折合计算，约占全国粮食总产量的11％左右，这对改善我国粮食状况有着极其重要的意义。但在目前，社会上和粮食系统中，还有不少人对发展薯类生产的意义认识不足。有些粮食工作干部对经营薯类问题只单纯从业务观点出发，把加工、保管、运输等技术方面暂时存在的困难看得多一些，没有从我国六亿人民这个角度来考虑问题。因此，反映在业务思想上存在着三怕，即怕麻烦、怕赔本、怕负责任，因而不积极开展薯类的经营工作；另一方面也存在只管购销，不管生产，只管国家，不管群众的本位主义思想。就农民方面来说，红薯是种上了，但是，有些人对今年种了这么多红薯却抱有一些疑虑，即红薯是否真的能顶粮食用？怕国家收购少而影响自己生活的调剂等等，如果不及时解决这些疑虑，势必影响下一步对红薯的中耕追肥，从而影响红薯增产计划的实现。这次粮食部在长沙市召开南方薯类会议，提早安排和解决红薯的经营管理，以扩大购销促进生产，是很及时的。从以上情况说明，积极扩大红薯经营，不仅是一项经济工作，而且还是一项重要的政治工作，它对改善我国目前粮食状况，巩固工农联盟和建设社会主义都具有重大的意义。
    当然，我们也不能不看到目前经营红薯在加工、保管、运输、食用等方面存在的客观困难，但是，只要大家鼓足干劲，多想办法，这些困难是可以克服的。红薯在我国有悠久的历史，分布地区较广，不少地区的农民一年四季吃薯，农民能保管好，难道我们不能吗？关键是在于肯不肯干？肯干就会找到办法，不肯干就永远没有办法。湖南和有些省市已经在经营薯类工作上抓了一下，在食用、保管、加工等方面都创造了很多经验，目前湖南市场许多酒菜馆制成了一百多种红薯食品应市，就很受消费者欢迎。
    要提高红薯身价，使大家乐于食用，不单纯是改变习惯，而是一个烹调加工的技术改革问题，各地应重视这项工作，有计划地培养几个典型，制作出“多样、美观、营养、价廉、卫生”的红薯食品，为扩大红薯消费打开门路。目前许多城市人民对红薯还缺乏食用习惯，还存在着一些思想顾虑，如何在这些人中树立起红薯的身价，仍然是思想战线上一项重要的任务，同时，要搞好薯类经营，光靠粮食部门还是不行的，必须与其他有关部门紧密协作，在当地党委领导下统一进行安排。如工业部门，特别是地方工业，应积极设计和制造能节省劳力、提高工效、操作简便、价钱便宜、适合农村分散加工的各种机械工具，以及研究适合农村使用的烘干办法，帮助农业社解决大量加工的困难，防止腐烂。运输部门则应及早总结已有的经验，做到快装快运，使红薯不受损失。只要大家共同协作，认真贯彻执行中央关于积极经营甘薯的指示，及早做好各项具体准备，我们的薯类经营工作一定能大大向前推进一步。
