Fuzhou, June 16th (Our reporters Guo Shuo Chuan and Sun De Xian) - Fujian Province's first furnace of steel has been successfully test-smelted in a small Bessemer converter self-made by the Fuzhou Universal Machine Factory. Recently, the Fuzhou municipal leadership held a victory celebration meeting at the factory, praising this spirit of bold thinking and bold creation.

The successful steelmaking at the Fuzhou Universal Machine Factory eloquently demonstrates the great role of opening the door to science and relying on collective creation. Originally, this factory did not have any personnel who understood steelmaking technology, nor did it have any steelmaking equipment. Many employees had never even seen steelmaking. Recently, when the Fujian Provincial Department of Industry wanted the factory to manufacture 350-ton-per-day sugar cane juicers, large lathes, and other machinery, materials were very tight, and relying on outside aid for steel could no longer meet the needs. At this time, Zhu Yangshun, the director of the foundry workshop, together with foundry workers Zheng Jinbu, Chen Xiaochun, Ye Daozhen, and Li Yunzhao, began to study and decided to break the mystery of steelmaking and make steel themselves. With the full support of the factory leadership, they organized a steelmaking test group and drew a sketch of a small Bessemer converter themselves. Without a ready-made converter, they converted an old molten iron ladle. Unable to find high-grade acidic refractory bricks to build the walls, they used a mixture of quartz sand and white clay instead, coating the furnace walls with a layer of water glass to prevent the sand particles from disintegrating and falling off at high temperatures. These indigenous methods made the small converter able to withstand temperatures of 1,500 degrees Celsius. It was as a result of more than 30 consecutive hours of brainstorming and persistent hard work by the local experts in the steelmaking test group, that the first furnace of steel in Fujian Province – low-carbon steel – was finally produced at 4:00 PM on June 3rd. Following this, medium-carbon steel and high-carbon steel were produced on the 9th, and the quality was very good.

This indigenous converter, collectively designed and manufactured by five local experts, has the following advantages: (1) Simple structure and convenient to use. Ordinary skilled workers can imitate it after taking a look. With molten iron, only two people are needed to watch the furnace, and a furnace of steel can be produced every fifteen minutes or so; (2) Low cost. As long as there is a 15-horsepower centrifugal blower and materials such as steel plates and quartz sand, this type of steelmaking furnace can be built. Each time the furnace wall is built, it can smelt four furnaces of steel. If higher-cost high-grade acidic refractory bricks are used, the life of the furnace wall can be greatly extended; (3) High efficiency and great use. General machine factories, repair shops, farm tool factories, and indigenous blast furnaces can all use this small converter to make steel and cast steel machine parts and components, to overcome the shortage of steel and the difficulty of forging steel machine parts with complex structures, and can greatly save working hours.

Now, the Fuzhou Universal Machine Factory has decided to attach a small steelmaking plant to the factory, to produce 22,000 tons of steel this year to supply the factory itself and support the needs of brother factories.

The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this initiative of the workers, believing that indigenous methods have solved major problems and can be widely promoted throughout the province. The success of steelmaking in Fujian not only eliminated a blank spot in our country that could not produce steel, but also, with the flowering everywhere of this small steelmaking converter and the establishment of large and medium-sized steel plants, Fujian, which has always been rich in iron ore reserves and high iron content in its ore sand, will rapidly become one of the provinces whose steel production can be completely self-sufficient and have a surplus.

    炼钢不神秘小炉显神通
    敞开科学大门　依靠集体创造
    福建炼出第一炉钢
    本报福州16日电　记者郭说传，孙德籼报道：福建省第一炉钢已在福州通用机器厂自制的小型贝氏炼钢炉中试炼成功。最近，福州市领导机关在该厂举行的炼钢成功祝捷大会上，表扬了这种大胆设想、大胆创造的精神。
    福州通用机器厂炼钢成功，雄辩地说明了敞开科学大门、依靠集体创造的巨大作用。原先，这个厂没有一个懂得炼钢技术的人员，也没有一点炼钢设备，许多职工更没有看过炼钢。最近，当福建省工业厅要这个工厂制造日榨三百五十吨榨糖机、大型车床等机械时，材料非常紧张，依靠外援钢材已经不能满足需要。在这个时候，铸工车间主任朱扬顺便和翻砂工人郑锦埠、陈小春、叶道祯和李云钊等一起研究，决心要打破炼钢之谜，自己动手炼钢。他们在工厂领导的全力支持下，组织了一个炼钢试验小组，自己画了一个贝氏小转炉的草图。没有现成的转炉，就用旧的铁水包改装；找不到高级酸性耐火砖砌壁，就用石英砂和白泥土混合起来代替，在炉壁上涂上一层水玻璃，以防止高温中砂粒分化脱落。这些土办法制成的小转炉，经过试炼，同样能耐一千五百度的高温。就在炼钢试验小组的土专家们经过连续三十多个小时的动脑筋、坚持苦战的结果，终于在6月3日下午四时，炼出了福建省第一炉钢水——低炭钢，接着又在9日炼出了中炭钢和高炭钢，质量都很好。
    这种由五个土专家集体设计和制造的土转炉有着下面的优点：（一）构造简单，使用方便。一般技术工人看一看就可以仿制，有了铁水后，只要两个人看炉，每隔十五分钟左右就能出一炉钢；（二）成本低，只要有一架十五马力的离心式鼓风机和钢板、石英砂等材料就能建立这种炼钢炉，每砌一次炉壁能炼四炉钢。如改用成本较高的高级酸性耐火砖砌成，炉壁寿命还可大大延长；（三）效率高、用处大。一般机器厂、修配厂、农具厂和土高炉，都可以利用这种小转炉来炼钢和铸制钢制机件和零件，来克服钢材不足和锻制结构较复杂的钢制机件的困难，并可以大大节省工时。
    现在，福州通用机器厂已决定在厂内附设一个小型炼钢厂，在今年产钢两万两千吨，以供应本厂和支援兄弟厂的需要。
    中共福建省委对工人们这种创举非常重视，认为是土办法解决了大问题，可以在全省普遍推广。福建炼钢成功，不但在我国消灭了一个不能产钢的空白点，而且随着这种炼钢小转炉的遍地开花和大、中型炼钢厂的设立，素以铁矿蕴藏量丰富、矿砂含铁量高的福建，将迅速变成一个钢产量能完全自给而有余的省份之一。（附图片）
