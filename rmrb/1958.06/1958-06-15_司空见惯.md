　　After the bribery scandal of Sherman Adams, assistant to the U.S. President, was revealed, the U.S. Democratic Party immediately launched an attack on the Eisenhower government and demanded the dismissal of this presidential aide. However, the U.S. President seemed to be unafraid of this attack, and publicly announced that he "still completely believes" in Adams.

　　The reason why Eisenhower was able to put on this attitude was not because he believed in the innocence of his subordinates, but because, in his opinion, such things are not worth making a fuss about in the officialdom of the United States. For example, Truman's Democratic government was also plagued by corruption scandals. The current Vice President Nixon was also a master of private gain when he was a congressman. Therefore, the reason why the U.S. President can calmly deal with the bribery scandals of his subordinates is simply because this president is accustomed to such scandals.

    司空见惯
    美国总统助理薛尔曼·亚当斯的受贿丑闻被揭露之后，美国民主党人立即对艾森豪威尔政府展开攻击，并且要求把这位总统助理撤职。但是，美国总统对这种攻击却似乎有恃无恐，因而公开宣布他对亚当斯“仍然完全相信”。
    艾森豪威尔所以能够摆出这种态度，倒不是由于他相信他的下属的清白，而是在他看来这种事在美国的官场中是不值得大惊小怪的。比如，杜鲁门的民主党政府也曾由于贪污丑行而闹得满城风雨。现任副总统尼克松在当议员的时候，也曾是一个营私舞弊的能手。所以，美国总统对他的下属的受贿丑行所以能够泰然处之，这只不过是由于这位总统对这种丑行已是司空见惯了。
