    Shanghai's Street Art
    By our reporter Zhang Feng
    During the recent General Line propaganda campaign, the entire Shanghai literary and art circles mobilized. Writers, actors, painters, and musicians all took to the streets, creating many new forms of street art.

    New Poems Pasted on Utility Poles
    On Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road, and in the factory districts of eastern and western Shanghai, many people were seen holding large stacks of red and green paper, pasting them on walls and utility poles.

    What were these posters? Passersby crowded around to take a closer look, and saw one that was printed in large, bold type:

    "The Bund is buzzing with excitement,
    Production leaps forward like a rocket,
    Where does this drive come from?
    Because we have the General Line!"

    These were poems written by writers, and the people pasting them were also members of the Writers Association.

    Jin Yi, Yi Qun, Wei Jinzhi, and more than twenty other writers wrote "flyer poems." The poems also used the traditional folk song format, making them vivid and accessible. More than 100,000 copies have now been pasted throughout the city.

    The Shanghai branch of the Writers Association also published the "Sun" wall newspaper on the streets. The writers said: We must be all-pervasive, using all forms of "street art" to spread our works to every corner!

    Zhou Xiaoyan Sings Songs in Local Dialect
    Walking into Fuxing Park, one could hear the sound of orchestral music. The center of the park was filled with people. The literary and art propaganda team, composed of members from Shanghai's writers, musicians, dramatists, and artists associations, as well as film actors, were "crossing the sea with their own unique talents," singing, playing, acting, reciting, creating propaganda paintings...everything was there.

    The famous soprano Zhou Xiaoyan stepped to the center. Accompanied by an accordion, she sang "Singing the General Line" in the style of Shanghai Opera and in the Shanghai dialect.

    Chasing "Xiao He" on the Street
    Amidst a flurry of drums and gongs, a "Xiao He" from the stage suddenly ran out of the crowd, wearing a gauze hat, a yellow robe, and a beard hanging down to his chest; a "worker" was chasing closely behind.

    What was going on? One usually sees "Xiao He chasing Han Xin" on stage, but never a worker chasing "Xiao He" on the street!

    Many people came forward to see what the commotion was about, and even the "People's Police" came to resolve the dispute.

    The "worker" said: The trade union club was performing "Chasing Han Xin," "Xiao He" ran around the stage once, turned around and left, while "Han Xin" was still waiting on stage...

    "Xiao He" said that he was a warehouse administrator at the Huafeng Enamel Factory. The factory was in the midst of a major technological revolution, creating an "automatic kiln." While he was acting, he suddenly remembered that the firebricks for building the kiln were in the warehouse, and he had the key. He had to take it back immediately!

    Thus, a story of technological revolution unfolded. The masses listened with rapt attention, and many people interjected, saying that "Xiao He" was doing the right thing and should hurry back with the key. The "People's Police" even volunteered to help him deliver it by bicycle. The "warehouse administrator" disagreed, because only he could handle opening the warehouse and issuing materials!

    Someone claiming to be an actor squeezed out, saying that he could also play "Chasing Han Xin" and would rush to the club to chase after the "Han Xin" waiting there. Thus, everyone was happy. The "warehouse administrator" hurried back to the factory to participate in the technological revolution!

    This was a street play performed by the Shanghai People's Art Theater.

    Yuan Xuefen Sings "Wang Haihai"
    In the green belt along the Huangpu River, the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe's General Line propaganda team arrived. Yuan Xuefen stood in front of the loudspeaker and sang new lyrics she had written herself in a tune very familiar to the masses:

    "Today I will not sing of past dynasties,
    Nor will I sing of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,
    There are countless praiseworthy deeds,
    I will sing of an ordinary woman, Wang Haihai,
        ..."

    This Yue Opera actress, famous on stage for playing Zhu Yingtai, is now singing the praises of a new woman of the new society – Wang Haihai, a well-known model worker's family member in the city.

    上海的街头文艺
    本报记者　张风
    在最近的总路线宣传运动中，上海文艺界全体出动，不论是作家、演员、画家、音乐家，都走上街头，创造了许多街头文艺的新形式。
    新诗贴在电杆上
    在南京路，在淮海路，在沪东沪西的工厂区，许多人手里拿着一大叠红绿纸，贴到墙壁上、电杆木上。
    这是什么招贴？走路的人挤上去看个明白，只见其中一张用头号铅字印着：
    “黄浦江边闹翻天，
    生产跃进赛火箭，
    这股干劲哪里来？
    因为有了总路线！”
    这原来是作家们写的诗，贴诗的人也是作家协会的会员。
    靳以、以群、魏金枝等二十多位作家都写了“传单诗”，诗的格式也运用了民歌的传统，生动通俗，现在全市已经贴了十多万份。
    作协上海分会还在马路上出了“太阳”墙报。作家们说：我们要无孔不入，利用各种“街头文艺”的形式，把作品流传到每个角落！
    周小燕唱方言歌曲
    走进复兴公园，就听到管弦乐的声音。公园中心聚满了人，由上海的作家、音乐家、戏剧家、美术家四个协会和电影演员们组成的文艺界宣传队，正在这儿“八仙过海”，“各显神通”，唱、奏、演、朗诵、宣传画……，样样都有。
    著名的女高音歌唱家周小燕站到中央来了。她在手风琴的伴奏下，用沪剧的调子、上海的方言，唱出了“歌唱总路线”。
    马路上追“萧何”
    一阵紧密的锣鼓，人群中突然跑出一个戏台上的“萧何”，头戴纱帽，身穿黄袍，挂着拖到胸前的髯口；后面紧紧追着一个“工人”。
    这是怎么回事？但见戏台上“萧何追韩信”，哪见马路上工人追“萧何”！
    许多人上前来看热闹，“人民警察”也来排解这场纠纷。
    “工人”说：工会俱乐部正在演“追韩信”，“萧何”在台上跑了一个圆场，掉头而去，“韩信”还在台上等……。
    “萧何”说，他是华丰搪瓷厂的仓库管理员，厂里正在大闹技术革命，创造“自动窑”，他演着戏，突然想到砌窑的耐火砖堆在仓库里，钥匙在自己身上，马上要送回去！
    于是，引出了一个技术革命的故事。群众都听得出神了，许多人插进来说：“萧何”做得对，应该赶紧把钥匙送回去，“人民警察”还自愿用自行车帮他送去。“仓库管理员”不同意，因为开仓库领东西，只有他亲自才能干！
    一个自称是演员的人挤了出来，他也能演“追韩信”，马上赶到俱乐部去追等在那儿的“韩信”，于是皆大欢喜，“仓库管理员”急忙赶回厂去，参加技术大革命！
    这是上海人民艺术剧院演出的一个街头剧。
    袁雪芬唱“王海海”
    在黄浦江边的绿化地带，上海越剧院的总路线宣传队来了。袁雪芬站到扩音机前，用群众非常熟悉的腔调唱出她自己编的新词：
    “我今天不唱前朝与后代，
    不唱梁山伯与祝英台，
    可歌的事迹千千万，
    要唱一唱一个平凡妇女王海海，
        ……”
    这位在舞台上以演祝英台著名的越剧演员，现在高歌着新社会的新妇女——闻名全市的优秀工人家属王海海。
