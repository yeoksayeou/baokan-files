More on Planting the Red Flag in the Home
    Yang Xuan

Last Sunday, I talked about the issue of planting the red flag in every home. The next day, Sister-in-law Wang from next door came to ask me: "I understand what you mean by implementing the General Line. But, what does 'planting the red flag' mean? Does it mean hanging a red flag in front of every house?"

So, I started chatting with Sister-in-law Wang. I said:

Implementing the General Line is everyone's responsibility. Only when everyone exerts their utmost effort and strives for excellence can the General Line be implemented effectively. However, to muster enough enthusiasm, it can't be done simply by taking a breath. It requires good ideology, high awareness, and a correct understanding of the socialist revolution. Now, everyone is striving to be advanced, and housewives can't lag behind either. We must also quickly raise our ideological awareness and plant the communist red flag in our minds.

What does it mean to plant the red flag in one's mind? Planting the red flag means that each of us should not only love our own home but also love the country, the Party, labor, and protect socialism. We should not only care about our own affairs but also care about everyone else's affairs and national affairs, embodying the spirit of "everyone for me, me for everyone," and treating collective matters as our own. We must implement every national policy in our homes, for example! Doing a good job in managing household affairs thriftily, carrying out the "Four Pests" elimination campaign and promoting hygiene, maintaining harmonious neighborly relations, studying culture, educating children, respecting the elderly, actively participating in street work, and so on, serving socialist construction in all aspects. If we truly achieve these things, then it counts as planting the red flag in our minds.

"Oh! So that's what planting the red flag means. That's not easy!" Sister-in-law Wang lacked confidence in being able to plant the red flag. In fact, many older sisters and sisters-in-law have already achieved these things. Why can others do it, but we can't? As long as we don't resign ourselves to falling behind, we can muster enough energy, think boldly, act boldly, and devote ourselves wholeheartedly to socialism. Then the red flower of the General Line will surely bloom in every one of our homes!

### 再谈把红旗插到家庭里

    再谈把红旗插到家庭里
    杨萱
    上个星期天，我谈到要把红旗插到每个家庭里去的问题。第二天，隔壁的王大嫂就来问我：“你说要贯彻总路线，这个我懂了。可，什么叫插红旗啊？是不是要每家门前都挂上一面红旗？”
    于是，我和王大嫂拉起来。我说：
    这贯彻总路线，是每个人的责任，只有大家都鼓足干劲，力争上游，才能把总路线贯彻好。可是，要把劲头鼓得足足的，不是吹一口气，就能办到的。这需要思想好、觉悟高，对社会主义革命事业有正确认识。现在，人人都在争取先进，家庭妇女也不能落后，咱们也必须赶快提高思想觉悟，在思想上树起共产主义的红旗。
    怎么才算是在思想上插红旗？插红旗，就是说：咱们每个人不仅要爱自己的家，还要爱国、爱党、爱劳动、爱护社会主义；咱们不仅要关心自己的事情，还要关心大伙儿的事，关心国家大事，“人人为我，我为人人”，把集体的事情当作自己的事情。要把国家的每项政策贯彻到家庭里去，譬如说吧！做好勤俭持家、搞好除四害讲卫生工作、邻里和睦、学习文化、教育子女、尊敬老人，积极参加街道工作等等，从各方面为社会主义建设服务。真正做到这些，那就算是在思想上插上了红旗。
    “哟！原来插红旗是这么回事，这可不容易！”王大嫂对能不能插红旗缺乏信心。其实，这些事，好多大姐大嫂到都已经做到了。为什么别人能做到的事情，咱们就不能做到呢？只要咱们不自甘落后，就能鼓足了干劲，大胆地想、大胆地干，一心为着社会主义，这总路线的红花一定在咱们每个家庭里开放！
