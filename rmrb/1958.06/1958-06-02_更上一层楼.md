    Reaching a Higher Level
    While farmers in various regions are welcoming and promoting rice planting boats, Changting County in Fujian Province has manufactured wooden rice planting machines, which is truly a double blessing. This matter illustrates that improvements can still be made on the basis of improvements, and one can reach an even higher level after reaching one level. We should constantly innovate, strive for excellence, and make agricultural tool improvement advance endlessly in the technical revolution movement.

    更上一层楼
    当各地农民正在欢迎和推广插秧船的时候，福建长汀县又制成了木质插秧机，这真是喜上加喜。这件事说明在改良了的基础上还可以改良，上了一层楼还可以更上一层楼。我们应当不断地推陈出新、精益求精，在技术革命运动中使农具改良无止境地前进。
