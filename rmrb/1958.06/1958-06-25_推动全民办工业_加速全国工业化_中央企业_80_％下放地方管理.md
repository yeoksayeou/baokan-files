Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Approximately 80% of enterprises and institutions under the central industrial ministries have been decentralized to local management. From the end of last year to June 15th, the nine industrial ministries successively completed the handover of over 880 decentralized units to various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

The large-scale decentralization of central enterprises began at the end of last year, based on the "Regulations on Improving the Industrial Management System" issued by the State Council on November 15th of last year and several "Decisions on the Decentralization of Industrial Enterprises" issued by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on April 11th of this year. This is a major improvement in China's industrial management system to adapt to the new situation of socialist construction and development. The purpose is to implement the general line of building socialism, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole Party and the whole people to run industry, accelerate the speed of socialist construction in China, enable the output value of local industry to exceed agricultural output value within a few years under the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and gradually form several economic zones with relatively complete industrial systems throughout the country. After the large-scale decentralization of enterprises, the role of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities can be fully utilized, while enabling the central ministries to concentrate their efforts on overall planning, organizing national collaboration and balance, and technical guidance and improvement.

According to the principles stipulated by the central government, all enterprises and institutions under the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry have been decentralized, except for four paper mills with special technologies and experimental nature, and another copper mesh factory that supplies copper mesh for the national paper industry. This includes a batch of factories under construction and preparation. Enterprises and institutions under heavy industry departments, except for a small number of large, special, and experimental units that remain under central management, are also being decentralized. During the decentralization process, the central ministries and the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities conducted full consultations. The central competent departments tried their best to meet the local requirements for decentralization; those that were difficult for the local authorities to accept temporarily were postponed. For example, the newly built coal mines in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Ningxia are still managed by the Ministry of Coal Industry because the local authorities do not have the strength to take over for the time being, and they will be decentralized after the conditions are mature. Some of the new enterprises under construction or preparation are still the responsibility of the central competent departments, while others have been taken over by the local authorities.

In order to enable areas with weaker industrial foundation and technical strength to obtain due development, the central government instructed all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to formulate necessary collaboration plans at different levels after the decentralization of enterprises. Necessary adjustments and arrangements were also made during this decentralization of central enterprises. For example, the decentralization of construction forces did not completely adopt the original method of decentralization. This time, Anhui, Shandong, Fujian, Guizhou, Guangxi and other provinces and regions will receive support from more than 5,000 people transferred from areas with more construction forces. The central government stipulates that after the decentralization of enterprises, the original plans for old factories to support new factories should continue to be implemented. Enterprises that are responsible for training cadres and technicians for new enterprises nationwide or elsewhere, such as the North China Pharmaceutical Factory, which is responsible for equipping the Second Chengdu Antibiotic Factory with a complete set of cadres, the Ministry of Chemical Industry will negotiate corresponding agreements with relevant provinces during this decentralization.

During this decentralization, the central competent departments and the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities also made arrangements for the future products, output, and cooperative relations between enterprises for some important enterprises. For example, the Caijiagang Mining Machinery Plant of the Huainan Mining Bureau undertakes the task of manufacturing mining machinery for coal mines nationwide. The Ministry of Coal Industry has agreed with Anhui Province that the nature of the plant will remain unchanged after decentralization, and the product output will still be arranged by the Ministry of Coal. In order to ensure the complete supply of electromechanical products, the cooperative relationships between many factories decentralized by the First Ministry of Machine Building will continue to be maintained, and the product tasks balanced by the state should still be completed as scheduled.

The central government stipulates that in addition to ensuring the completion of the original planned tasks assigned by the central government, if the central government puts forward new urgent tasks, the local authorities should try to complete them if conditions permit. If local authorities put forward task requirements for enterprises and institutions retained by the central government, the central competent departments should also try to meet local requirements if conditions permit.

### 推动全民办工业　加速全国工业化  中央企业80％下放地方管理

    推动全民办工业　加速全国工业化
    中央企业80％下放地方管理
    新华社24日讯　中央各工业部所属的企业和事业单位，已经有80％左右下放给地方管理。从去年年底开始到6月15日止，九个工业部与各省、自治区、市陆续办理了八百八十多个下放单位的交接工作。
    中央企业大部分下放，是根据去年11月15日国务院关于改进工业管理体制的规定，以及今年4月11日中共中央、国务院关于工业企业下放的几项决定，从去年年底开始实行的。这是我国工业管理体制适应社会主义建设发展的新形势而实施的一项重大的改进。目的是为了贯彻建设社会主义的总路线，充分发挥全党办工业、全民办工业的积极性，加快我国社会主义建设的速度，使地方工业的产值在工农业同时并举的方针下几年之内能够超过农业产值，并且逐步地在全国形成若干个具有比较完整的工业体系的经济区域。企业大部下放以后，可以充分发挥省、自治区、市一级的作用，同时使中央各部能够集中力量做好全面规划、组织全国大协作、大平衡和技术指导、提高的工作。
    根据中央规定的原则，纺织工业部和轻工业部所属的企业、事业单位，除了四个技术特殊的和试验性的纸厂，以及另一个为全国造纸工业供应铜网的铜网厂以外，已经全部下放。其中还包括一批正在建设和筹建中的工厂。重工业部门所属的企业、事业单位，除了小部分大型的、特殊的以及试验性的单位仍归中央继续管理以外，其余也一律下放。在实行下放的过程中，中央各部与各省、自治区、市进行了充分的协商，地方要求下放的单位，中央主管部门尽可能满足地方的要求；地方一时难以接收的，则暂缓下放。如在云南、贵州、宁夏地区新建的煤矿，由于地方一时没有力量接管，仍由煤炭工业部继续管理，待条件准备成熟以后再行下放。正在建设或筹建中的新企业，有的仍由中央主管部门继续负责建设，有的也交由地方接管。
    为了使工业基础和技术力量较弱的地区，能够得到应有的发展，中央指示各省、自治区、市在企业下放以后应该分级制定必要的协作规划，这次中央企业在下放时也作了必要的调整和安排。如建筑力量的下放，没有完全采取原地下放的办法，安徽、山东、福建、贵州、广西等省、区，这次将得到从原来建筑力量较多的地区调出的五千多人的支援。中央规定，企业下放以后，原来确定的老厂支援新厂的计划要继续执行。负有为全国或为别处的新企业培训干部、技工的企业，如华北制药厂担负着为成都第二抗生素厂配备全套干部的责任，这次下放时，化学工业部同有关省将商订相应的协议。
    这次下放时，中央主管部门同各省、自治区、市还对一些重要的企业今后的产品、产量以及企业间的协作关系，作了安排。如淮南矿务局蔡家岗矿山机械厂，担负着全国煤矿矿山机械制造任务，煤炭工业部已经同安徽省商妥，该厂下放后性质不变，产品产量仍由煤炭部安排。为了保证机电产品的成套供应，第一机械工业部下放的许多工厂之间的协作关系将继续维持，由国家平衡的产品任务仍应如期完成。
    中央规定，下放企业、事业单位除了保证完成中央原定的计划任务外，如中央提出新的紧迫任务，在条件许可下，地方应该设法完成。中央保留的企业、事业单位，如地方提出任务要求，在条件许可下，中央主管部门也应该设法满足地方要求。
