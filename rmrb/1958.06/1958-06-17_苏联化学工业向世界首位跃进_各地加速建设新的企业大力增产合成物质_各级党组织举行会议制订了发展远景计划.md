Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th - The Soviet chemical industry, currently ranked second in the world, is directly catching up with the United States, advancing towards the world's first place. It is estimated that by 1965, the output of synthetic materials in the Soviet Union will be close to the current level of the United States. In a few more years, it will be able to leave the United States behind in this regard and take the world's leading position.

The resolution passed by the May Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on accelerating the development of the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic materials, has been warmly supported by the entire Soviet people. The resolution stipulates that in the next seven years, the total output of chemical industrial products in the Soviet Union will almost double, and 257 new and rebuilt chemical industrial enterprises will be built. In the past month, a series of measures have been taken from the central to local levels to greatly accelerate the development of the chemical industry.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the chemical industry and promote the development of this industrial sector, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently decided to change the Soviet Ministry of the Chemical Industry to the State Chemical Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the former Ministry of Chemical Industry recently jointly established the Science and Technology Committee for Synthetic Materials to strengthen scientific research and production research on synthetic materials. In addition, it is also planned to establish various chemical research institutes in Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Siberia and other regions.

The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of many Soviet republics have successively held plenary sessions, and many state, frontier, and city party organizations have also held meetings of party activists to discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee. The party organizations in these regions have formulated long-term plans for the development of the chemical industry in their respective regions.

The plan recently adopted by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan stipulates that during the period from 1959 to 1965, the republic's chemical industry production will be increased by two to three times, of which man-made fibers and synthetic fibers will be increased by nine times. The Azerbaijan Republic plans to increase chemical industry production to more than six times this year by 1965, so that the sulfuric acid and mineral fertilizers produced in the republic can fully meet the needs of the republic in the next five to seven years. Georgia and Armenia will increase chemical industry production by three times and nine times respectively in recent years. In the Belorussian Republic, the seven-year plan stipulates that thirteen new chemical industry factories will be built. The Bashkir Autonomous Republic of the Russian Federation plans to allocate billions of rubles to develop the chemical industry in the next seven years. It is estimated that in seven or eight years, the chemical industry production of this autonomous republic alone will exceed the level of the United Kingdom in 1957.

Now, many new chemical industrial enterprises are being accelerated across the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's first large-scale workshop for the production of synthetic detergents, built at the Krasnovodsk oil processing plant in the Turkmen Republic, will be completed by the end of this year and put into production.

The Soviet Union wants to establish a strong industry for plastics, synthetic fibers, and other synthetic materials in the next few years. This will make it possible to widely adopt substitutes for non-ferrous metals, plant raw materials, and animal raw materials, and at the same time greatly increase the production of high-quality consumer goods and reduce costs.

    苏联化学工业向世界首位跃进
    各地加速建设新的企业大力增产合成物质
    各级党组织举行会议制订了发展远景计划
    新华社莫斯科16日电　目前居世界第二位的苏联化学工业正在直追美国，朝世界第一位前进。预计到1965年，苏联的合成物质的产量就将接近美国目前的水平。再过几年，它就可以在这方面把美国抛在后面而居世界领先地位。
    苏共中央五月全体会议通过的加速发展化学工业、特别是合成物质生产的决议获得了苏联全体人民的热烈拥护。这个决议规定，在最近七年内，苏联的化学工业品总产量差不多将增加二倍，新建和改建的化学工业企业将有二百五十七个。近一个月来，从中央到地方已经开始为大大加速发展化学工业采取了一系列措施。
    为了加强对化学工业的领导，促进这个工业部门的发展，苏联最高苏维埃主席团最近决定把苏联化学工业部改为苏联部长会议国家化学委员会。苏联科学院和前化学工业部不久前还联合成立了合成物质科学技术委员会，以加强对合成物质的科学研究和生产研究工作。此外，还准备在乌克兰、乌兹别克、阿塞拜疆、西伯利亚和其他地区建立各种化学研究所。
    苏联许多加盟共和国共产党中央委员会先后举行全体会议，许多州、边疆区和城市的党组织也举行党积极分子会议，讨论贯彻苏共中央决议的问题。这些地区的党组织会议都制定了本地区发展化学工业的远景规划。
    乌兹别克共产党中央委员会全体会议最近通过的计划规定，在1959年到1965年期间，把共和国的化学工业生产增加二倍到三倍，其中人造纤维和合成纤维要增加九倍。阿塞拜疆共和国计划到1965年把化学工业生产增加为今年的六倍以上，在最近五年到七年内使共和国生产的硫酸和矿质肥料能充分满足这个共和国的需要。格鲁吉亚和亚美尼亚共和国最近几年将分别把化学工业生产增加三倍和九倍。在白俄罗斯共和国，七年计划规定要新建十三个化学工业工厂。俄罗斯联邦的巴什基尔自治共和国计划在最近七年间拨出几十亿卢布来发展化学工业，预计在七、八年后，单是这一个自治共和国的化学工业生产就将超过英国1957年的水平。
    现在，苏联各地正在加速建设许多新的化学工业企业。在土库曼共和国的克拉斯诺沃德石油加工工厂建设的苏联头一个生产合成洗濯物质的大型车间，将在今年年底建成，并且投入生产。（附图片）
    苏联要在最近几年建立强大的塑料、合成纤维和其他合成材料工业。这样就有可能广泛采用有色金属、植物原料和动物原料的代用品，同时还可以大大增加优质消费品的生产和降低成本。
