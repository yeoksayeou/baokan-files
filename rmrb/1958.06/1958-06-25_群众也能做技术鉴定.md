The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant uses the method of great debate to handle technical innovation suggestions. This is a specific approach to implementing the Party's mass line in production technology work.

The people are the creators of history. We must rely on the masses to carry out revolutionary struggles, we must rely on the masses to develop social productive forces, and we must rely on the masses for everything. This is our Communist Party's principle. Although this is an old saying, not all enterprises act according to this principle in their various tasks. Take the handling of rationalization proposals regarding production technology put forward by the masses as an example. Many enterprises have not relied on the masses and mobilized the masses to do it, but have simply handed it over to a few engineering and technical personnel or the rationalization proposal committee to handle. Entrusting it to a few people often leads to either poor handling or untimely handling. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in production, the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses flew in like snowflakes. Relying on a few people, they couldn't even register them in time, let alone handle them. As a result, some important rationalization proposals were not handled for a long time, production problems were not solved, and the enthusiasm of the masses was dampened. Leading cadres talk about relying on the masses to improve production every day, but they still cannot avoid being divorced from the masses. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's use of great debate to handle technical innovation proposals from the masses in the technical innovation movement is a truly mass line approach. Adopting this method can not only handle thousands of suggestions in a timely manner, but also allow the masses (including engineering and technical personnel) to express their opinions on each suggestion. Through debate, they can learn from each other's strengths and overcome the conservative thinking of some people, promote advanced thinking, and make the suggestions of the masses more perfect. The masses see their suggestions being quickly adopted or handled, and quickly blossom and bear fruit in production and construction, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher.

Some enterprise leaders do not dare to let go and mobilize the masses to handle rationalization proposals, mainly because their thinking has not been completely liberated, and they are still a bit superstitious about engineering and technical personnel, believing that the appraisal of technology can only be done by people with theoretical knowledge in books, and not by ordinary workers. Of course, some workers' rationalization proposals need to be theoretically improved and supplemented by engineering and technical personnel, but there is no need to be superstitious that only they can do technical appraisals, and only they can handle rationalization proposals. As the saying goes, "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang." The experience of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant proves that relying on the broad masses of workers and staff to handle rationalization proposals is more in line with the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical" than relying only on a few engineering and technical personnel, isn't it?

Of course, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's organization of mass debates is only one method of implementing the mass line in the work of handling technical innovation proposals, and not the only method. In practice, various enterprises can also create various methods suitable for their specific circumstances. However, no matter what method is adopted, to implement reliance on the masses, one must first break superstition and liberate thought.

    群众也能做技术鉴定

    太原钢铁厂用大辩论的方法处理技术革新建议，这是在生产技术工作中，贯彻党的群众路线的一个具体作法。
    人民群众是历史的创造者。进行革命斗争要依靠群众，发展社会生产力也要依靠群众，一切都要依靠群众，这是我们共产党的原则。这虽然是老生常谈了，但是并不是所有的企业在各种工作中都按照这个原则来办事的。就拿处理群众提出的关于生产技术方面的合理化建议来说吧，不少企业就没有依靠群众，发动群众来做，而只是交给少数工程技术人员或者合理化建议委员会去办。交给少数人去办，往往不是办得不好，就是办得不及时。特别是在生产大跃进的时候，群众提的合理化建议雪片一般飞来，依靠少数人，连登记都来不及，哪里还谈得上处理。于是，有些重要的合理化建议长期得不到处理，生产问题得不到解决，群众的积极性受到打击。领导干部天天讲依靠群众搞好生产，结果仍免不了脱离群众。太原钢铁厂在技术革新运动中，用大辩论的办法处理群众的技术革新建议，是一个真正的群众路线的办法。采用这个办法，不仅可以及时地处理上千上万条建议，而且可以让群众（包括工程技术人员在内）把自己对每一个建议的意见摆出来，通过辩论，取长补短，克服某些人的保守思想，发扬先进思想，使群众的建议更加完善。群众看到自己的建议很快被采纳或处理，很快在生产、建设中开花结果，生产积极性就更加高涨。
    有些企业的领导人所以不敢放手发动群众处理合理化建议，主要是思想没有彻底解放，对工程技术人员还有点迷信，认为对技术的鉴定，只能由有书本理论知识的人来做，而不能由一般工人来做。当然，有些工人的合理化建议，需要工程技术人员从理论上加以提高和补充，但是用不着迷信只有他们才能做技术鉴定，只有他们才能处理合理化建议。俗话说得好：“三个臭皮匠，顶一个诸葛亮”。太原钢铁厂的经验证明，依靠广大职工群众处理合理化建议，不是比起只依靠少数工程技术人员更符合多快好省的精神吗？
    当然，太原钢铁厂组织群众辩论，只不过是在处理技术革新建议工作中贯彻群众路线的一个方法，而不是唯一的方法。各个企业在实践中，还可以创造出各种适合自己具体情况的方法来。但是，不论采取什么方法，要贯彻依靠群众，首先就得破除迷信，解放思想。
