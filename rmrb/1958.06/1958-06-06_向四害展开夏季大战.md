Launch a Summer War Against the Four Pests
    By a staff commentator

    Summer is the season when mosquitoes and flies breed, when rats and sparrows multiply. It is also the time when the four pests are rampant, spreading disease, stealing grain, and acting as major enemies of mankind.

    The Central Committee's instruction on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene points out: In a year, the early spring, when the four pests begin to be active, is a major battle; summer and autumn, when infectious diseases are rampant, is a major battle; and winter, combined with manure accumulation, water conservancy construction, improvement of sanitation conditions, and elimination of overwintering mosquitoes and flies, is another major battle. Now that summer has arrived, the time for our second major battle against the four pests is here. Many areas have already mobilized the masses to wage another major battle against the four pests. This is very necessary. Based on the characteristics of the season and the habits of the four pests, the main targets of pest elimination at present are flies and mosquitoes. Eliminating existing mosquitoes and flies and eradicating their breeding grounds are of urgent significance for ensuring the health of the people and eliminating various summer infectious diseases. In areas where conditions permit, rats and sparrows can also be encircled and suppressed.

    Since last winter and this spring, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people throughout the country, in order to ensure their health, defend the fruits of their labor, and live a civilized life, have launched a fierce offensive against the four pests on the basis of past victories, annihilating large numbers of the four pests, and creating thousands of basically four-free societies, villages, towns, and counties, achieving great results. The broad masses have been tempered, benefited, and gained understanding in the fight against the four pests. All of this has laid a solid foundation for the thorough elimination of the four pests in the future. We are fully capable and it is also necessary to expand our victories and strive for new victories on this basis.

    For areas that have achieved basic four-freedom in winter and spring, summer is a season of severe testing for them. Complacency and paralysis are unacceptable. Those relaxing thoughts of "we are already four-free here" must be criticized. The ability to achieve basic four-freedom is precisely the result of going all out, working hard, and constantly preventing the conditions for the four pests to breed; if we relax our defenses, slow down, and give the four pests the conditions to breed, then the four pests will make a comeback. Achieving basic four-freedom in winter and spring prepares favorable conditions for four-freedom in summer and autumn. However, to truly achieve four-freedom in summer and autumn, we must continue to work hard and conduct another major battle. At the same time, the experience of winter and spring is not entirely applicable to summer and autumn. We must create more complete and systematic experience in order to keep the glorious red flag of four-freedom permanently planted on our doors. The resurgence of the four pests in some places, especially the appearance of mosquitoes and flies, is largely related to the incomplete work in the past and the arrival of summer. However, the main reason is the relaxation of work and the paralysis of thought. Therefore, leaders at all levels need to be vigilant, overcome complacency, boost the morale of the masses, make continuous assaults, sweep repeatedly, and go deeper step by step in order to achieve the goal of completely eliminating the four pests.

    In a large number of areas and units, the four pests have not yet been basically eliminated. At this time, we should make a hundred times more effort, strive to be upstream, and catch up. However, some areas are content to be in the middle reaches. They say, "The four pests have been almost eliminated." They are content with this "almost" situation. If you don't advance, you retreat. If you are in the middle reaches in winter and spring and don't work hard to move forward now, then "good times don't last long," and you will definitely fall to the downstream in summer and autumn. Therefore, vigorously mobilizing the masses and striving for four-freedom should be the direction for these areas.

    There are also some areas and units that have not seriously eliminated the four pests to this day. Without a doubt, if they do not work hard to eliminate the four pests when they are rampant in summer, diseases may follow, affecting attendance rates and hindering the leap in production. It is necessary to immediately combine with production, appropriately allocate manpower, and widely and deeply publicize the elimination of the four pests to the masses. Through practical examples, enlighten the masses to be conscious, launch a vigorous movement to eliminate the four pests, change the backward situation, catch up with the advanced areas, and work together to make our country a four-free civilized country as soon as possible.

    Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene is an important aspect of mankind's great struggle to conquer and transform nature, and it is also an important part of our cultural revolution. The realization of the cultural revolution, like the realization of the technological revolution, is of great significance for implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Chairman Mao pointed out in "Introducing a Cooperative": "It may not take as long as previously thought for our country to catch up with the major capitalist countries in terms of industrial and agricultural production. In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor." If our country truly eliminates the four pests, pays attention to hygiene, thereby eliminating diseases, making everyone healthy and invigorated, turning the weak into the strong, and turning the backward into the advanced, then 600 million people will have even higher enthusiasm and greater drive, thereby building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically.

    Summer has arrived. When it comes to the four pests, the best of the thirty-six stratagems is to strike hard. Sichuan Province has launched a summer campaign to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, and Beijing has launched a summer campaign centered on eliminating flies, mosquitoes, and ditch rats. All localities must mobilize the entire people to wage another major battle against the four pests. In the all-round leap forward of socialist construction in our country, rationally arrange the battle to eliminate the four pests and have a great leap forward in eliminating the four pests.

　　向四害展开夏季大战
    本报评论员
    夏天，是蚊蝇孳生的季节，是鼠雀繁殖的时期，而且还是四害猖狂活动，散播病疫，劫谷盗粮，大肆与人类为敌的时期。
    中央关于除四害讲卫生的指示指出：在一年中间，春初四害开始活跃的时候是一场大战斗，夏秋间传染病猖獗的时候是一场大战斗，冬季结合积肥、修水利、改善卫生条件、消灭越冬蚊蝇又是一场大战斗。现在夏天到了，我们同四害再次大战的时刻到了。许多地区已经动员群众同四害作再一次的大战。这是很必要的。根据季节的特点和四害的习性，目前除四害的主要对象是苍蝇和蚊子。消灭已出现的蚊蝇，铲除其孳生地，这对保证人民的健康，消灭夏令的各种传染病，更有着十分迫切的意义。在有条件的地区，也可以对老鼠和麻雀进行围剿。
    自去冬今春以来，全国各地广大人民，在党的领导下，为了保证自己的健康，保卫劳动果实，过文明的生活，在过去胜利的基础上，向四害展开了猛烈的攻势，大量歼灭四害，出现了成千上万的基本四无的社、村、镇、县，获得了很大的战果。广大群众在除四害战斗中受到了锻炼，得到了好处，提高了认识。所有这些，已经为今后彻底消灭四害打下了深厚的基础。我们完全有可能而且也有必要在这个胜利的基础上，去扩大战果，争取新的胜利。
    对于在冬春已经作到基本四无的地区，夏季是对它们严重考验的季节。自满和麻痹思想是要不得的。“我们这里已经四无了”那些松劲的想法必须受到批判。能做到基本四无，正是因为鼓足干劲，大干几场，经常防范，不给四害孳生条件的结果；如果放松防范，松下劲去，给四害以孳生条件，那末，四害就会卷土重来。冬春作到基本四无，为夏秋四无准备了有利条件。但是真正在夏秋要做到四无，却要继续努力，再度进行大战才行。同时，冬春的经验，不完全适用于夏秋。我们要创造更为完整系统的经验，才能使四无的光荣红旗永远插在门上。目前有的地方四害回生，特别是蚊蝇的出现，与过去工作搞得不彻底和夏季到来，都有很大的关系。但是，更主要的是工作松劲和思想麻痹的结果。因此，各级领导有必要提高警惕，克服麻痹思想，鼓起群众的干劲，连续突击，反复扫荡，步步深入，才能达到彻底消灭四害的目的。
    大量的地区和单位，四害还未基本除尽。这时应当百倍努力，力争上游，赶上前去。但是有些地区却安处中游。他们说，“四害已经除得差不多了。”他们安于这种“差不多”的情况。不进则退，如果在冬春季节处于中游，现在不努力前进，那么“好景不长”，到夏秋季一定会退到下游的。所以，大力发动群众，力争四无，应该是这些地区的方向。
    还有一部分地区和单位，迄今还没有认真除四害，毫无疑问，在夏季四害大肆猖獗的时候，如不努力除四害，病疫就可能接踵而来，影响出勤率，影响生产跃进。必须马上结合生产，适当调配人力，广泛深入地向群众进行除四害的宣传，通过实际事例，启发群众自觉，掀起轰轰烈烈的除四害运动，改变落后面貌，赶上先进地区，共同努力使我国早日变成一个四无的文明国家。
    消灭四害，讲究卫生是人类征服自然和改造自然的伟大斗争的一个重要方面，也是我国文化革命的重要组成部分之一。而实现文化革命，同实现技术革命一样，对于贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线有重大意义。毛主席在“介绍一个合作社”一文中指出，“我国在工农业生产方面赶上资本主义大国，可能不需要从前所想的那样长的时间了。除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”如果我们全国真正做到消灭四害，讲求卫生，从而消灭疾病，人人健康，个个振奋，转病弱为健强，转落后为先进，那末，六亿人民一定会热气更高，干劲更大，从而更多、更快、更好、更省地建设社会主义。
    夏天已经到了，对于四害，三十六着，狠打为上。四川省已经开展夏季除蚊蝇突击运动，北京市已经投入了以消灭苍蝇、蚊子和沟鼠为中心的夏季战役。各地必须动员全民，同四害再来一次大战。在我国社会主义建设的全面跃进中，合理安排除四害战斗，来一个除四害的大跃进。
