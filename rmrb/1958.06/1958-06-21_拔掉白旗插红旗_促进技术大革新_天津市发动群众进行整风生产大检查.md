Pull Out the White Flag and Plant the Red Flag: Promoting Technical Revolution
Tianjin Launches Mass Movement for Rectification and Production Inspection

(Our Tianjin dispatch, June 20th, reporter Shi Jian) The rectification movement in Tianjin has entered a new high tide since the promulgation of the General Line. In order to implement the General Line, ensure a complete victory for the rectification movement, and further promote the technical revolution and a great leap forward in production, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, starting in late May, has been vigorously publicizing the General Line throughout the city. At the same time, more than 1,000 members of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, Municipal Party Committee members, and responsible cadres from various departments formed inspection teams, going deep into factories, stores, government offices, and other units to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and fully relying on Party organizations at all levels to mobilize the masses to conduct rectification and production inspections.

Breaking superstitions and liberating minds is a prominent feature of this new high tide. More than 4,000 Party member cadres above the section chief level in the city, starting from the beginning of June, spent half a day each day carefully studying Chairman Mao's speech and the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and others at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and held heated discussions in connection with the actual work of their departments and their personal ideological realities. Many people discussed the various ideological obstacles affecting the liberation of their minds, criticized the errors of dogmatism and empiricism in their work, as well as right-leaning conservative thinking, and expressed their determination to overthrow the Jia Gui style, cut off their slave tails, and promote the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Many inspiring new scenes have appeared in government work. After hearing the transmission of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the morale of the workers and masses in various factories was even higher. They put forward many heroic statements: "Resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words. We must have what other countries don't have. We must do what other countries can't do!" "Study the General Line, dare to think and dare to act. Propose innovations today, and realize them the next day. If there's no time normally, use public holidays to experiment. Transform manual work into machines, and fill the workshops with red flowers." The communist spirit and fearless courage have begun to be established among the broad masses of workers. Many things that they never dared to think or do in the past are now being boldly thought about and boldly done. The Deqing Machinery Factory in Nankai District, with only twenty-odd workers and very simple machinery and equipment, proposed to complete the 1958 plan four months ahead of schedule without increasing equipment or personnel, and to achieve full automation throughout the factory. Three items, including drilling holes, have already been automated. Li En'yuan, a boiler repairman at the Tianjin No. 2 Power Plant who did not graduate from elementary school, created a tool for removing ash and scale from boiler water pipes, which improved the thermal efficiency of the boiler and reduced the work that used to take three hours to two minutes, solving a problem that the power system had not been able to solve for a long time. Similar facts are appearing in large numbers almost every day. Many breakthroughs in breaking with conventions and bold innovations have also appeared in stores.

Fully utilizing the mass line method and mobilizing the broad masses to work together to inspect rectification and production is another characteristic of this new high tide. After the inspection began, the workers of various factories, enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives posted millions of big-character posters within two or three days. Many units also wrote articles and poems and drew cartoons. The content of these big-character posters and articles is very different from the past. Most of them affirm achievements, praise leading cadres for improving their work style, and propose suggestions for technical innovation. Many big-character posters summarize the achievements of the rectification movement in vivid language and review the changes before and after the rectification. Some workers also held "dummy meetings" to summarize the main reasons why they could not complete the plan before the rectification and exceeded the plan every month after the rectification. Sharp criticisms and constructive opinions were also raised about the shortcomings of the leadership. Some factories adopted lively methods such as "temple fairs," mass reception stations, and exhibitions to display the problems in rectification and production, mobilize workers to visit, conduct on-site criticism, and have factory directors and Party committee secretaries listen to workers' opinions and rectify them on the spot, so that many key problems were solved in a timely manner. Because the broad masses participated in the general inspection of rectification and production, it actually formed a profound self-education movement. For example, after more than 170 workers in the first section of the battery factory inspected rectification and production, they held an exhibition to show the changes in this section before and after the rectification: before the rectification, 15% frequently beat and scolded people, 12.5% frequently violated labor discipline, and 55% left work and did not actively participate in social activities; after the rectification, the phenomenon of beating and scolding people has rarely occurred, the number of people who frequently violate labor discipline has decreased to 1.4%, and the number of people who leave work has also decreased to 1.4%. The Renli Woolen Mill held an exhibition celebrating the great harvest of rectification, using big-character posters, cartoons, and real objects, which further educated the workers greatly. The Dong Shuzhen group in this factory used to consume a lot of raw materials and did not complete the plan well; after rectification, it became the group with the lowest consumption and completed the production plan very well. Through recollection and comparison, the workers finally summarized four experiences: improving awareness, strengthening unity, improving operations, and learning advanced experience, which further consolidated the achievements of the rectification movement.

Under the impact of the mass inspection of production and rectification, the white flags of a few backward units are being pulled out one after another, and red flags are being planted. The Tianjin Canvas Factory, a well-known backward unit in Nankai District, had an un-united leadership core in the past, and they blamed each other when they could not complete the production tasks. After the propaganda and inspection of the General Line, the masses were mobilized, and sharp criticisms were raised against the leadership, demanding that the leadership announce the production plan. After the leadership announced the plan, the workers were full of energy. In the last six days of May, they not only made up for the more than 5,700 meters of canvas that had not been completed in the first twenty-odd days of May, but also exceeded the quota by 2,600 meters. In the first ten days of June, they exceeded the quota by more than 1,000 meters. Under the promotion of the masses, the leading cadres also actively followed the shift, and the general branch secretary vigorously supported the innovative initiatives of the workers. The backward appearance of the factory was quickly changed.

On the basis of great ideological liberation, the broad masses of people have devoted themselves to the magnificent wave of technical revolution with doubled spirits, further promoting the great leap forward in production. According to incomplete statistics in Nankai District, more than 7,000 suggestions for technical innovation were put forward in a few days. Some factories have seen a situation where every machine has innovations and everyone has creations. In April and May, the Dagu Chemical Plant only completed 54.2% of the second quarter's plan. After the inspection of rectification and production began, the workers put forward more than 500 suggestions, and more than 900 technical innovations appeared, which not only enabled them to complete the second quarter's plan, but also doubled the annual leap forward plan.

At present, the city's rectification and production inspection is continuing. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has promptly promoted the advanced experience found in the inspection; the problems found are also being systematically solved.

    拔掉白旗插红旗　促进技术大革新
    天津市发动群众进行整风生产大检查
    本报天津20日电　记者石坚报道：天津市的整风运动，在总路线公布以后进入一个新的高潮。中共天津市委员会为贯彻执行总路线，使整风运动获得全胜，并进一步开展技术革命，推动生产大跃进，从5月下旬开始，在全市大张旗鼓地宣传总路线。同时，又由市委书记处的书记、市委委员和各部门负责干部一千多人组成检查组，深入到各工厂、商店、机关等单位，传达八大二次会议的精神，并充分依靠各级党的组织发动群众，进行整风、生产大检查。
    破除迷信，思想大解放，是这个新高潮的显著特点。全市四千多名科长以上的党员干部，从6月初开始，每天以半天的时间，认真学习八大二次会议上毛主席的讲话和刘少奇、邓小平等同志的报告，并联系本部门的工作和个人的思想实际，进行了热烈讨论。许多人谈出了影响思想解放的种种思想障碍，批判了工作中教条主义、经验主义的错误，以及右倾保守思想，表示决心打倒贾桂作风，割掉奴隶尾巴，发扬敢想敢说敢做的精神。机关工作出现了许多振奋人心的新气象。各工厂职工群众听了八大二次会议的传达以后，情绪更加高涨。他们提出许多壮言豪语：“坚决听毛主席的话，别国没有的，我们要有。别国做不出来的，我们要做！”“学习总路线，敢想又敢干，今天提革新，转天就实现，平常没时间，公休来试验，手工变机器，红花满车间。”共产主义的风格、大无畏的气概，在广大工人中开始树立起来。许多过去从来不敢想、不敢做的事情，开始大胆地想、大胆地做了。南开区的德庆机器厂只有二十多个工人，机器设备十分简陋，提出不增设备、不增人，提前四个月完成1958年计划，全厂实现自动化。现在已有打眼等三项实现了自动化。天津第二发电厂小学没有毕业的锅炉检修工李恩元，创造了清除锅炉水管灰垢工具，提高了锅炉的热效率，使三小时的活两分钟就干完，解决了电业系统长期没有解决的问题。类似这样的事实几乎每天都大量出现。在商店中，也出现了许多打破陈规、大胆革新的创举。
    充分运用群众路线的方法，发动广大群众一齐动手，对整风和生产进行检查，是这个新高潮的另一特点。检查开始以后，各工厂、企业、手工业合作社的职工们，在两三天的时间内，就贴出了上百万张大字报。许多单位的职工还写了文章、诗歌，画了漫画。这些大字报、文章的内容与过去有很大的不同，肯定成绩，表扬领导干部改进作风和提出技术革新建议的占大多数。许多大字报用生动的语言总结了整风运动的成果，回顾了整风前后的变化。有的工人还开了“论虚会”，总结了整风前不能完成计划、整风后月月超额完成计划的主要原因。对领导上的缺点也提出尖锐批评和建设性的意见。有些工厂采用“庙会”、群众接待站、展览会等生动活泼的方法，将整风、生产中的问题进行展览，发动工人参观，现场鸣放，厂长、党委书记等听取工人意见，现场整改，使许多关键问题及时得到解决。由于广大群众参加了整风和生产的大检查，实际上形成了一个深刻的自我教育运动。如电池厂第一工段的一百七十多工人对整风和生产进行了检查以后，举办了展览会，展出这个工段在整风前后的变化：整风前经常打人、骂人的占15％，经常违犯劳动纪律的占12.5％，下班就走、不积极参加社会活动的占55％；整风后，打人、骂人现象已经很少发生，经常违犯劳动纪律的降低到1.4％，下班就走的也减少到1.4％。仁立毛呢厂职工用大字报、漫画、实物等，举办了庆祝整风大丰收的展览会，使工人们进一步受到很大教育。这个厂东淑珍小组过去原材料消耗大，完成计划不好；整风后成为消耗量最低的小组，生产计划完成的也很好。工人们通过回忆对比，最后总结为：提高了觉悟、加强了团结、改进了操作、学习先进经验等四项经验，进一步巩固了整风运动成果。
    在群众性的检查生产和整风的浪潮冲击下，少数落后单位的白旗正陆续被拔掉，插上了红旗。南开区著名的落后单位——天津帆布厂过去领导核心不团结，生产任务完不成就互相埋怨。通过总路线的宣传和检查，群众发动起来以后，对领导上提出尖锐批评，要求领导上把生产计划公布出来。领导上公布了计划以后，工人们干劲十足，5月下旬六天中不但补上了5月份前二十几天没有完成的五千七百多公尺帆布，还超额二千六百公尺。6月上旬又超额一千多公尺。在群众的推动下，领导干部也积极起来，厂长积极跟班劳动，总支书记大力支持职工的革新创举，全厂落后面貌迅速改观。
    在思想大解放的基础上，广大群众精神百倍地投入雄伟的技术革命的浪潮中，进一步促进了生产大跃进。据南开区不完全统计，几天中就提出技术革新的建议七千多件。有些工厂已出现了台台有革新，人人有创造的局面。大沽化工厂在4、5两个月一共才完成第二季度计划的54.2％。对整风和生产的检查开始以后，职工们提出五百多件建议，出现了九百多项技术革新，不但能完成第二季度计划，而且又使全年的跃进计划加了一番。
    目前，全市的整风、生产大检查正继续进行。中共天津市委对检查中发现的先进经验，已及时予以推广；对发现的问题，也正有计划地予以解决。
