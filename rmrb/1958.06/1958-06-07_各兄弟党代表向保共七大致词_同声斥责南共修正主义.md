Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 6th: Representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, the Romanian Workers' Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Korean Workers' Party, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the Algerian Communist Party delivered speeches at the Bulgarian Communist Party's Seventh Congress on June 4th. They congratulated the Bulgarian Communist Party on achieving further great successes in building socialism and fighting for peace.

　　Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, Muckenberger, said in his speech that the relations between the two parties and countries of Germany and Bulgaria are constantly strengthening on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, which he read, stated that the boundless loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, as well as the firm unity of our two countries in the invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, bind us together.

　　Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Kliszko, pointed out in his speech that the Polish United Workers' Party is engaged in a resolute struggle against all acts that undermine the party's ideological unity and against revisionism, because revisionism is the main danger of the current workers' movement. Revisionism attempts to make the workers' movement regress to the path of opportunism and compromise with the bourgeoisie, create ideological confusion, and deny the important role of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the solidarity and cooperation of socialist camp countries. Our party also resolutely opposes sectarianism and dogmatism. Kliszko said that in order to maintain and strengthen the unity of the international workers' movement on the basis of proletarian internationalism and Marxism-Leninism, our party has criticized the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He concluded by saying that People's Poland is now and will remain a loyal and powerful member of the great family of socialist camp countries.

　　Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, Ceaușescu, said in his speech that the Romanian Workers' Party, like the Bulgarian Communist Party and other communist and workers' parties that signed the Moscow Declaration, believes that its primary duty is to resolutely defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, expose and severely combat revisionism and its attempts to undermine the unity of communist and workers' parties and undermine the working people's confidence in the victory of socialism. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia fully reflects the anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist views of modern revisionism. Therefore, the Romanian Workers' Party, like other fraternal parties, condemns this program that harms the communist movement and the workers' movement and actually serves the enemies of socialism, the imperialists. The Romanian Workers' Party will continue to contribute to the cause of continuously strengthening the unity of the communist and workers' parties headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　Member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Feher, pointed out that the main lesson we have learned from the counter-revolutionary events is that we must ensure the guiding and leading role and unity of the revolutionary party and the working class in all aspects of political, social, and economic life. Another lesson is that we must constantly strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. He went on to point out that one of the main tasks of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is to fight for the work of strengthening ideological purity. First of all, we should strive to eliminate the ideological remnants of counter-revolutionary words and deeds and oppose all forms of "national communism," petty-bourgeois, revisionist, nationalist, and chauvinist ideas. At the same time, we oppose the danger of the revival of sectarianism and dogmatism. When talking about the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Feher said that our party stands on the same position as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other fraternal communist and workers' parties.

　　Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Li Hyo-soon, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, saying that the Korean people will make every effort to comprehensively consolidate and develop the friendship and solidarity with the Bulgarian people. He said that an important factor in our common struggle for the final victory of socialism and communism is to resolutely counter modern revisionism. He pointed out that the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Korean Workers' Party, and other fraternal parties not only stand firmly at the forefront of strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the international workers' movement, but also have achieved complete agreement in terms of views, ideology, and line in the struggle against modern revisionism. The Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people, as in the past, will remain loyal to the ideas of proletarian internationalism and will firmly fight to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union.

　　Member of the Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, Nguyen Chi Thanh, said that the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the unbreakable friendship between the two parties and peoples of Vietnam and Bulgaria, which is based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

　　Representative of the Algerian Communist Party, Abdel Kader Wahrahni, said: Today, the Algerian Communist Party is fighting side by side with the National Liberation Front, which is leading the national independence struggle against French imperialism, and is wholeheartedly devoted to the struggle for the liberation of its own people. Our confidence in the inevitable victory of our just cause is growing stronger day by day. Wahrahni expressed his deep gratitude to the Bulgarian people and all those who support the just cause of the Algerian people. He expressed the hope that the international communist workers' movement would more forcefully support the Algerian people in all aspects. Wahrahni said that the Algerian communists are in complete agreement with your opinion that the strength of the communist and workers' parties lies mainly in their ideological unity, which is based on Marxism-Leninism. Wahrahni pointed out that revisionism has today stepped onto the international stage as the main danger to communist and workers' parties. Like all fraternal communist parties, the Algerian Communist Party believes that it is necessary to apply Marxism-Leninism in accordance with the national conditions of Algeria. But it cannot forget the experience accumulated by the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, nor can it forget the inestimable role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace, for the freedom of all peoples, and for the construction of socialism. We believe that all true proletarian internationalists should base themselves on a true and unreserved unity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 5th: At the BCP Congress meetings on the 5th and 4th, many leaders of the BCP spoke at the meetings.

　　Member of the Political Bureau of the BCP Central Committee and Minister of Internal Affairs, G. Tsankov, spoke at the morning meeting on the 5th, focusing on the issue of raising revolutionary vigilance and strengthening the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

　　Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the BCP Central Committee and Minister of National Defense, General of the Army Peter Panchevsky, pointed out in his speech the great efforts made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in easing international tensions. The people of the socialist camp are vigilantly watching and angrily condemning the cunning conspiracies of the imperialists.

　　President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Pavlov, criticized the views and theories of modern revisionism in his speech.

　　At the afternoon meeting on the 4th, Member of the Political Bureau of the BCP Central Committee, Chervenkov, spoke. In his speech, he criticized modern revisionism. He said that our party unanimously believes that any support for arguments similar to the LCY program that completely violate the principles of Marxism-Leninism is incompatible with the nature of our party. Any attempt to weaken the friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and to weaken our people's respect, love, and loyalty to the Soviet Union to any extent is also incompatible with the nature of our party; the LCY program contains such an attempt.

　　Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the BCP Central Committee, Bulgaranov, spoke at the meeting, talking about the development of socialist democracy in the country. He criticized the revisionists' views on the withering away of the state and on the evolution from capitalism to socialism.

　　He said that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia raises the issue of the gradual withering away of the state, and regards this issue as the basic and decisive issue of the current socialist social system. Indeed, only those who, like the Yugoslav leaders, have already been submerged in the sea of revisionism would think that when private ownership still dominates in their villages, the small-peasant economy still prevails, and capitalist relations of production still exist, the issue of the gradual withering away of the state is "a basic and decisive issue of the socialist social system."

　　Bulgaranov also said that the Yugoslav leaders also ignore the issue of class struggle on an international scale. When it can be clearly seen that imperialism is using all means and forces to weaken the socialist countries, split them, and restore the old capitalist system in these countries, the Yugoslav leaders are talking about the gradual withering away of the state.

　　At the morning meeting on the 4th, Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the BCP Central Committee, Gaev, said in his speech that the basic principles of modern revisionism are systematically expressed in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. At the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which was full of revisionist views, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries were slanderously abused, but the essence of capitalism, especially the essence of American imperialism, was not mentioned at all. Gaev emphasized that we have been fighting against various forms of revisionism for decades, and we will not abandon this sacred duty of our own now.

　　Chairman of the National Committee of the Fatherland Front, Staikov, said: After the failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, the imperialist aggressors, especially the American imperialists, tried every means to undermine the unity of the socialist camp. They have been constantly strengthening the slanderous and defamatory movement against the socialist camp countries, especially against the leading force of the socialist camp - the Soviet Union. In this regard, the American imperialists placed their hope on the Yugoslav revisionists. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists, fully expresses the anti-Marxist-Leninist views of the Yugoslav revisionists.

　　各兄弟党代表向保共七大致词
    同声斥责南共修正主义
    据新华社索非亚6日电　在保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会6月4日的会议上，德国统一社会党、波兰统一工人党、罗马尼亚工人党、匈牙利社会主义工人党、朝鲜劳动党、越南劳动党、阿尔及利亚共产党的代表分别致词。他们祝保共在建设社会主义和争取和平的斗争中进一步取得伟大成就。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员穆肯柏格尔致词说，德保两党和两国之间的关系在无产阶级国际主义的基础上正在不断加强。他宣读的德国统一社会党中央委员会的贺词中说，对马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义原则的无限忠诚以及我们两国坚定地团结在以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营的立场使我们联结在一起。
    波兰统一工人党中央书记克利什科致词指出，波兰统一工人党正在进行坚决斗争以反对一切破坏党在思想上的团结一致的行为，反对修正主义，因为修正主义是当前工人运动的主要危险。修正主义企图使工人运动倒退到机会主义和同资产阶级妥协的道路上去，制造思想上的混乱，否认无产阶级专政和社会主义阵营国家团结合作的重要作用。我们党也坚决反对宗派主义和教条主义。克利什科说，为了在无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义的基础上保持和加强国际工人运动的统一，我们党批评了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案。他最后说，人民的波兰现在是、将来仍然是社会主义阵营国家大家庭的忠实而强有力的一员。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员和中央书记齐奥塞斯库致词说，罗马尼亚工人党同保加利亚共产党和其他在莫斯科宣言上签字的共产党和工人党一样，认为自己的主要义务是坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性，揭露并且狠狠地打击修正主义及其破坏共产党和工人党的团结一致、破坏劳动人民对社会主义胜利的信心的企图。南共纲领充分反映了现代修正主义的反马克思主义和反列宁主义的观点。因此，罗马尼亚工人党同其他兄弟党一样，谴责这个给共产主义运动和工人运动带来危害、实际上是为社会主义的敌人、帝国主义者服务的纲领。罗马尼亚工人党今后将继续对不断加强以苏联共产党为首的各国共产党和工人党的团结一致的事业作出贡献。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员费赫尔致词指出，我们从反革命事件中得出的主要教训是：必须保证革命政党和工人阶级在政治、社会和经济生活各方面的指导和领导作用以及团结一致。另一个教训是必须不断加强无产阶级专政。他接着指出，当前匈牙利社会主义工人党的主要任务之一是为加强纯洁思想的工作而斗争。首先应该力求清除反革命言行的思想残余，反对形形色色的“民族共产主义”的、小资产阶级的、修正主义的、民族主义的、沙文主义的思想。同时也反对宗派主义和教条主义复活的危险。费赫尔在谈到南共的修正主义纲领时说，我们的党同苏联共产党、中国共产党和其他兄弟共产党和工人党站在同一立场上。
    朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员和中央书记李孝淳代表朝鲜劳动党中央致祝词说，朝鲜人民将尽一切努力来全面巩固和发展同保加利亚人民的友谊和团结。他说，在我们为社会主义和共产主义的最后胜利而进行的共同斗争中的一个重要因素是坚决反击现代修正主义。他指出，保加利亚共产党、朝鲜劳动党和其他兄弟党不但坚定地站在加强社会主义阵营和国际工人运动的团结一致的最前线，并且在反对现代修正主义的斗争中取得了观点、思想和路线各方面的完全一致。朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民同过去一样，将来仍然忠实于无产阶级国际主义思想，并将坚定地为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民间的友谊和合作而斗争。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员阮志清致词说，越南劳动党和越南人民热烈地祝贺越保两党和两国人民以无产阶级国际主义精神为基础的牢不可破的友谊。
    阿尔及利亚共产党代表阿卜德尔·卡德尔·瓦赫拉尼致词说：今天，阿尔及利亚共产党同领导反法国帝国主义的民族独立斗争的民族解放阵线并肩作战，全心全意投入争取解放本国人民的斗争。我们对自己的正义事业必将取得胜利的信心一天比一天坚定。瓦赫拉尼向保加利亚人民和一切支持阿尔及利亚人民正义事业的人们表示深切的感谢。他表示希望国际共产主义工人运动在一切方面更有力地声援阿尔及利亚人民。瓦赫拉尼说，阿尔及利亚共产党人同你们的意见完全一致，认为共产党和工人党之所以有力量，主要是因为它们思想上的团结，这种思想团结的基础是马克思列宁主义。瓦赫拉尼指出，修正主义今天已经作为对共产党和工人党的主要危险走上了国际舞台。同所有的兄弟共产党一样，阿尔及利亚共产党认为必须根据阿尔及利亚的民族条件来运用马克思列宁主义。但是它也不能忘记光荣的苏联共产党所积累起来的经验，不能忘记苏联在争取和平、争取各国人民自由和建设社会主义的斗争中所起的难以估计的作用。我们认为，所有真正的无产阶级国际主义者应该以同苏共实行真正的、无保留的团结作为自己的基础。
    据新华社索非亚5日电　在保共代表大会5日和4日会议上，保共许多领导人在会上发了言。
    保共中央政治局委员、内务部长格·赞科夫在5日上午会议上发了言，着重谈到了提高革命警惕性和加强无产阶级专政的机构的问题。
    保共中央政治局候补委员、国防部长彼奥特·潘切夫斯基大将在发言中指出了苏联和其他社会主义国家在缓和国际紧张局势方面所作的巨大努力。社会主义阵营各国人民警惕地注视并愤怒地谴责帝国主义者狡猾的阴谋。
    保加利亚科学院院长巴夫洛夫在发言中批判了现代修正主义的观点和理论。
    在4日下午会议上，保共中央政治局委员契尔文科夫发了言。他在发言中批判了现代修正主义。他说，我们党一致认为对类似南共纲领的完全违背马克思列宁主义原则的论点的任何支持，都是同我们党的性质不相容的。不管在任何程度上削弱保苏友谊的以及削弱我国人民对苏联的尊重、爱戴和忠诚的任何企图，也是同我们党的性质不相容的；南共纲领就包含着这种企图。
    保共中央政治局委员、书记处书记布尔加拉诺夫在会上发了言，他谈到国内社会主义民主的发展。他批判了修正主义者关于国家消亡、关于从资本主义进化到社会主义的观点。
    他说，南共纲领草案中提出了关于国家逐步消亡的问题，把这个问题作为社会主义社会制度当前的基本的和有决定意义的问题。的确，只有像南斯拉夫领导人那样一些已经淹没在修正主义大海中的人才会认为：当他们的乡村中私有制还占统治地位、小农经济还占优势、资本主义的生产关系还存在的时候，关于国家逐步消亡的问题是“社会主义社会制度基本的和有决定意义的问题”。
    布尔加拉诺夫还说，南斯拉夫领导人还无视国际规模的阶级斗争问题，当明显地可以看出帝国主义正在用一切手段和力量力图削弱社会主义国家、分裂它们和要在这些国家中恢复旧的资本主义制度的时候，南斯拉夫领导人却在大谈国家的逐步消亡。
    在4日上午会议上，保共中央政治局委员、书记处书记加?夫在发言中说，现代修正主义基本原则在南共纲领草案中有了系统的表现。在充满着修正主义观点的南共第七次代表大会上曾用下流的谩骂中伤苏联和其他社会主义国家，而对资本主义的本质，首先是美帝国主义的本质问题却只字未提。加?夫强调说，我们在几十年当中一直在同各种表现形式的修正主义进行斗争，现在也不放弃自己这一神圣的职责。
    保共中央政治局委员、祖国阵线全国委员会主席斯塔伊科夫说：在匈牙利的反革命叛乱失败后，帝国主义侵略者，首先是美帝国主义者曾经千方百计地企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结。他们不断加强反对社会主义阵营各国，特别是反对社会主义阵营的领导力量——苏联的造谣污蔑运动。在这方面，美帝国主义者寄希望于南斯拉夫修正主义者。南共七大通过的南共纲领充分表现了南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思列宁主义观点。
