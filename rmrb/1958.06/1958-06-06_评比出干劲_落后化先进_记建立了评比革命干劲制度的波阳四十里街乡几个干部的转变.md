　　Vying to Stimulate Enthusiasm: Laggards Transform into the Advanced
　　Recording the Transformations of Several Cadres in Boyang’s Sili Street Township After Establishing a System for Appraising Revolutionary Zeal
　　Yu Gan

　　Sili Street Township is the first township in Boyang County to establish a system for appraising revolutionary zeal. While we were interviewing there, the Township Party Committee helped us convene a symposium, and we also participated in a meeting to appraise zeal. Through the symposium and participation in the meeting, we specifically understood the reactions caused by the appraisal of zeal in various different individuals. The following introduces several people who have undergone major changes after the appraisal. Among them are people who originally had great zeal but later developed complacency, people who previously used coercion and command and later completely abandoned leadership, people who passed the test in the rectification movement but later planned to take the capitalist road, and people who were consistently lax and lethargic. Now, these different people have all been educated in the appraisal of zeal, have all truly mustered their zeal, and are leaping forward.

　　Arrogance Finds it Hard to Rise
　　At the township-wide cadre meeting for appraising zeal, Chen Hanyun, the Party Branch Secretary of Xinzhuang Cooperative, stood up with great enthusiasm and said: Last time, everyone rated me as having first-class zeal. This time, I self-report that I can still be rated as having first-class zeal.

　　Everyone began to appraise, and some said that Chen Hanyun has been very arrogant since being rated as having first-class zeal. Some said that Chen Hanyun’s work has been very superficial recently, only in one group, and he rarely inquires about other groups. Some said that during rice transplanting, Chen Hanyun only made arrangements and did not inspect, and many rice paddies in his cooperative did not meet the standards. Thus, everyone unanimously agreed to rate Chen Hanyun as having third-class zeal.

　　This appraisal result was like ringing an alarm bell for Chen Hanyun, waking him up. Chen Hanyun returned to the cooperative and immediately went deep into the fields to inspect. When he found rice paddies that did not meet the standards, he mobilized the masses to transplant seedlings. When some of the masses were not active, he mobilized everyone to appraise zeal, and the seedlings were quickly transplanted. During the third appraisal of zeal, everyone rated him as having second-class zeal. After returning, Chen Hanyun again overcame his shortcomings based on everyone’s opinions. In addition, he organized a youth shock team of more than thirty people to apply topdressing fertilizer to the seedlings in the barren fields overnight, making these weak seedlings quickly thrive. After such efforts, at the fourth meeting, Chen Hanyun was again rated as having first-class zeal.

　　Changes Really Fast
　　Hu Xiangyun, the production team leader of Taipingqiao Cooperative, was rated as having third-class zeal for the first time and then rated as having first-class zeal for the second time, which is truly a leap forward. In the past, when Hu Xiangyun was the production team leader, the masses had a lot of opinions about him because of his rigid attitude and coercion and command. During the rectification movement last year, he was criticized by the masses and made a self-criticism to the masses. This year, the masses elected him as the production team leader again, but he went from one extreme to the other. In the past, he used coercion and command, but now he completely abandoned leadership. He thought: Now they shouldn’t be able to say that I have a “Kuomintang style,” right?

　　At the meeting for appraising zeal, the masses raised their opinions about him and said: Hu Xiangyun’s problem of coercion and command is gone, but he has developed extreme democratization. When the work arranged by the superiors, some people are unwilling to do it, and he does not actively organize everyone to do it. Therefore, the labor discipline of the entire team is lax, and many women stay at their mothers’ homes and do not return to participate in production. If this continues, this year’s production will not even maintain last year’s output, how can we leap forward?

　　“Leap forward, leap forward, third-class zeal!” After the meeting, Hu Xiangyun thought about it more and more, and he was determined to rectify the labor discipline. In the past, when cooperative members delivered manure to the fields, they only delivered twelve carts a day, and each cart only weighed about two hundred catties. After the rectification, each person could deliver twenty carts a day, and each cart weighed three hundred catties. During rice transplanting, more than four hundred catties of mixed fertilizer were applied per mu, which was one hundred catties more than other teams. Because of the large amount of fertilizer applied, the rice seedlings grew well and became the best team among the eleven teams in the cooperative, gloriously winning the red flag of the competition!

　　When appraising zeal for the second time, Hu Xiangyun’s heart was pounding. People asked him to self-report, and he reluctantly reported a second-class rating. After the appraisal, everyone said: Hu Xiangyun is humble, accepts criticism, and quickly changes his style. He should be the one with the greatest zeal!

　　No Longer Takes the Wrong Path
　　Not long after the rectification movement, Wu Lianxi, the production team leader of Taipingqiao Cooperative, was making his own calculations again. During the rectification movement last year, he was criticized for having serious capitalist ideas. Now he believes that he has passed the test and is preparing to go out and run a business.

　　In the appraisal of zeal, the masses criticized this erroneous thinking of abandoning production leadership and focusing on personal enrichment, and rated Wu Lianxi as having third-class zeal. After the meeting, the Party Branch Secretary also talked to him. He said that he was a Party member and also the production team leader, and it would be terrible if he continued like this. He also told him that the appraisal of zeal is not the same as the rectification movement, and it will be conducted two or three times a month. As long as he completely corrects his mistakes, he can still be rated as having first-class zeal.

　　Two or three times a month was both a joy and a worry for Wu Lianxi. The joy was that he had the opportunity to remove the "third-class" label. The worry was that his business would be completely finished this time. After thinking it over and over, he decided to turn back. He got up early and returned late every day, leading the cooperative members to work in the fields. He ignored the pain in his waist and delivered manure, transplanted rice, and weeded... After being rated as having second-class zeal for the second time, he became more active in production. He was ahead of others in everything he did. The cooperative members were very happy to see Wu Lianxi’s transformation. Some cooperative members even ran to the cooperative and said to the cooperative director: "This time, our team leader should be rated as having first-class zeal!" Indeed, at a meeting for appraising zeal not long ago, Wu Lianxi was rated as having first-class zeal.

　　Stepping Out of the Counter
　　A room of more than twenty square meters was completely filled with people. As soon as the chairman finished speaking, before he had time to self-report, a young man sitting under the gas lamp stood up and said: "When it comes to zeal, I think Jiang Fulin’s is really great, and he should be rated as having first-class zeal!" Immediately afterwards, he stated his reasons. The second, the third... one person spoke after another. In addition to agreeing with the opinion of the first comrade, they also made supplements. Some comrades also briefly talked about Jiang Fulin’s shortcomings, hoping that he would work hard to correct them in the future. Finally, the chairman stood up and asked: "Does everyone agree to rate Jiang Fulin as having first-class zeal?"

　　"Agree!" The voices of thirty or forty people combined together were really a bit deafening. At this time, Comrade Jiang Fulin, who was sitting on the side, finally raised his head, and a smile appeared on his dark face.

　　Jiang Fulin, about forty years old, is a salesman in the township supply and marketing cooperative. In the past, some people called him a "lazy ghost." If no one called him in the morning, he would sleep in. When working, he only knew how to guard the counter. He neither bothered to go to the countryside nor loved to study. He also used the excuse that he was busy with work and did not actively participate in labor production. More than a month ago, during the first appraisal of zeal, the masses said that he was lethargic and rated him as having third-class zeal.

　　He was full of anger at that meeting. He thought: I am a salesman, and I only need to guard the shop. How can I manage so much? Besides, I am not a student, what is there to study! After learning about this situation, a cadre from the County Party Committee stationed in Sili Street Township talked to him and explained the principles to him. After a night of ideological struggle, he slowly came to his senses. The next morning, he got up early and made a guarantee to the Township Party Committee Secretary: to strive for first-class zeal.

　　Jiang Fulin’s thinking is changing day by day. He opens the door early and closes the door late. He also steps out of the counter, carrying a peddler's pole to the countryside to sell goods and collect waste products. He returns fully loaded, carrying almost one hundred forty to fifty catties. In the past, when cargo ships came, workers were hired to carry the goods. Now he takes the lead in carrying them himself. In more than a month, he has saved more than six hundred yuan for the state. He has also begun to develop the habit of reading newspapers. Whenever he has time, he goes to the cadre experimental fields to participate in production. People say that since the appraisal of zeal, Jiang Fulin has completely changed!

　　The “Prodigal Son” Returns
　　Yu Yongquan was originally a farmer by origin and had certain production skills. It was just that in the past he learned opera for a few days, and he became more and more disdainful of farm work. Therefore, the masses of the Taipingqiao Cooperative where he was located had a lot of opinions about him. Although there were changes after the rectification movement, he was still not active in working. During the first appraisal of zeal, he was rated as third-class.

　　After a period of ideological struggle, Yu Yongquan thought: In terms of technology, I am no worse than others, so why should I always fall behind?

　　When the rice seedlings were planted, he was the first to sign up to participate. Planting rice seedlings is extremely important. If the seeds are not planted well, transplanting will become a problem. The leadership was a little worried, but his will was firm, so they had to let him try it. The result was very good. Not long after the seedlings emerged from the soil, they encountered strong winds and heavy rain, and the lives of the seedlings were really in danger. At this time, Yu Yongquan, wearing a straw raincoat and a bamboo hat, guarded the seedlings all night, protecting the safety of the seedlings.

　　At the second appraisal meeting, everyone said: Yu Yongquan protected the rice seedlings well, but he only knew how to do it himself and did not mobilize the masses to do it together, so he was only rated as second-class. Later, he made improvements in this area and also taught the technology to others. The masses said: It’s really “the prodigal son returns and is more precious than gold!” The third time, he was rated as having the greatest zeal.

　　评比出干劲  落后化先进
    记建立了评比革命干劲制度的波阳四十里街乡几个干部的转变
　　于赣
    四十里街乡，是波阳县首先建立评比革命干劲制度的乡。我们在那里采访时，乡党委会帮助我们召开了个座谈会，我们也参加了一次评比干劲的会议。通过座谈和参加会议，具体地了解了评比干劲在各种不同的人物中所引起的反应。下面介绍的，就是经过评比发生较大变化的几个人。这里面，有原来干劲很大，以后滋长了骄气的人，有过去强迫命令、后来又完全放弃领导的人，也有在整风中过了关，后来又打算走资本主义道路的人，还有一贯散漫、暮气沉重的人。现在，这些不同的人，都在评比干劲中受到了教育，都真正的鼓足了干劲，向前跃进。
    骄气难抬头
    在全乡干部评比干劲的会议上，新庄社支部书记陈汉云兴致勃勃地站起来说：上一次，大家评我是一类干劲，这次，我自报，我还可评为一类干劲。
    大家开始评了，有人说，陈汉云从评为一类干劲以后，骄气很大；有人说：陈汉云最近一个时期工作很不深入，只是在一个组里，对别的组很少过问；有人说，在插秧中，陈汉云只布置不检查，他所在的社里有很多秧田不合标准。这样，大家一致意见，将陈汉云评为三类干劲。
    这次评比结果，等于向陈汉云敲了一次警钟，将他惊醒了。陈汉云回到社里，立刻深入田间检查，发现不合标准的秧田，就发动群众补插。有些群众不积极，他就发动大家评干劲，很快就将秧苗补全了。第三次评干劲时，大家将他评为二类干劲。回去后，陈汉云又根据大家意见，克服了自己的缺点。另外，组织了三十多人的青年突击队，连夜向瘦田的秧苗施追肥，使这些瘦弱的秧苗很快地茁壮起来。经过这样的努力，在第四次的会议上，陈汉云又被评为一类干劲了。
    变得真是快
    太平桥社生产组长胡香云，第一次被评为三类干劲，第二次就被评为一类干劲，这真是一个跃进。过去，胡香云做生产组长时，因为态度生硬，强迫命令，群众对他很有意见。去年整风时，受到了群众的批判，向群众做了检讨。今年，群众又选他做生产组长，他却从一个极端走上另一个极端，过去是强迫命令，这时却是完全放弃领导。他这样想：这下该不能再说我有“国民党作风”了吧？
    在评比干劲的会议上，群众对他提意见说：胡香云强迫命令的毛病是没有了，但却发展了极端民主化。上级布置的工作，有人不愿干，他就不积极组织大家干。因此，弄得全组劳动纪律散漫，好多妇女住娘家不回来参加生产。这样下来，今年的生产连去年的产量也保持不住，怎么能跃进呢？
    “跃进，跃进，三类干劲！”散会后，胡香云越想越不对头，下决心要把劳动纪律整顿一下。过去社员往地里送粪，每天只送十二车，每车只有二百来斤。经过整顿后，每人每天可送二十车，每车载重三百斤。插秧时，光混合圆肥每亩就下了四百多个，比别的组多一百来个。由于施肥多，禾苗也长得好，在全社十一个组里，成为最好的组，光荣地夺得了竞赛的红旗！
    第二次评比干劲时，胡香云心里直跳。人家叫他自报，他勉强报了个二类的。经过评比以后，都说：胡香云虚心，接受批评，迅速转变作风，应该是干劲最大的！
    不再走歪路
    整风过去不久，太平桥社生产组长吴连喜，又在打自己的算盘了。去年整风时，他因资本主义思想严重，曾经受到批判。现在他认为已经过了关，又准备出去跑生意了。
    评比干劲中，群众批判了这种放弃生产领导，专管个人发财的错误思想，给吴连喜评了个三类干劲。散会后，党支部书记又找他谈话。说他是个党员，又是生产组长，老这样下去，可不像话呀。还告诉他：评干劲比不得整风，每月都要进行两三次，只要彻底改过，还会被评为一类的。
    每月两三次，对吴连喜是一喜一忧。喜的是“三类”的帽子有机会摘掉；忧的是：自己的生意这回要彻底完蛋了。想来想去，他下决心回头了。每天早起晚归，带领社员下地干活。腰疼，也顾不得了，一样送粪，插秧，薅草……。第二次，被评为二类干劲后，生产更加积极。做什么都走在人家的前面。社员看到吴连喜的转变，都很高兴。有的社员还跑到社里，对社主任说：“这回，我们的组长可该评为一类干劲了吧！”真的，在不久以前的评比干劲会议上，吴连喜被评为一类干劲了
    走出柜台来
    一间二十多平方公尺的房子里，全塞满了人。主席的话刚落音，还没有来得及自报，坐在汽灯下的一位小伙子，便站起来说：“要说是干劲，我看姜福林的可真不小，应该评为一类！”紧接着，他便述说了自己的理由。第二个、第三个……一个挨一个发言。他们除了同意第一个同志的意见外，还作了补充。有的同志对姜福林的缺点，也扼要地谈了一下，希望他今后努力改正。最后，主席站起来问：“把姜福林评为一类干劲，大家是不是同意？”
    “同意哟！”三、四十人的声音合到一起，实在有点震耳。这时，坐在一旁的姜福林同志，才抬起头来，他那黝黑的脸上，浮起了笑容。
    姜福林，四十来岁的年纪，乡供销社的业务员。过去，有人叫他“懒鬼”。早晨要没人叫他，就一直睡大觉。工作时，只知道死守柜台，一不顾下乡，二不爱学习。还借口工作忙，不积极参加劳动生产。一个多月前，在第一次评比干劲时，群众都说他有暮气，把他评为三类干劲。
    那次会上，他憋了一肚子气。心想：我是个业务员，只要能守住门面就行，那里能管得那么多。再说，又不是学员，还学习个什么！县委驻四十里街乡的一位干部知道了这个情况后，就找他谈话，讲道理给他听。经过一夜的思想斗争，他才慢慢地想开了。第二天一早起来，就找乡党委书记提出保证：要争取一类干劲。
    姜福林的思想，一天天地转变着。早开门，晚关门，并走出了柜台，挑着货郎担下乡推销货物，收购废物，来回满载，差不多都在一百四五十斤上下。过去运货船来，都是雇工人搬运；现在他带头自己搬。一个多月来，给国家节约了六百多元。读报纸，也开始养成了习惯。一有功夫，便到干部试验田参加生产。人们都说：评干劲以来，姜福林完全变样了！
    “浪子”回了头
    虞涌泉，本来也是庄稼人出身，有一定的生产技术。只是因为过去学了几天戏，对庄稼活便越来越瞧不起。因此，他所在的太平桥社群众，对他很有意见。整风后虽说有了改变，但干活仍不积极。第一次评比干劲时，他被评为三类的。
    虞涌泉作了一番思想斗争后，心想：论技术，我也不比别人差，为什么总要落在人后？
    秧苗下种时，他头一个报名参加。秧苗下种这个活，极关重要。种子下不好，插秧就成了问题。领导上有点不放心，但他的意志坚决，只得叫他试一下。结果很好。秧苗出土不久，就遇着大风大雨，秧苗的性命实在危险。这时，虞涌泉披着蓑衣戴着斗笠，整夜地守护在秧苗边，保护秧苗的安全。
    在第二次的评比会上，大家都说：虞涌泉保护秧苗好，但只知道自己干，没有发动群众一齐搞，只被评为二类的。以后，他在这方面有了改进，还把技术教给别人。群众说：真是“浪子回头金不换”！第三次，他便被评为干劲最大的了。（附图片）
