To Ensure the Rectification Movement is Successfully Completed
    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress General Office and Directly Subordinate Agencies of the State Council Strengthen Leadership Over the Rectification

    (Our report) Following the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the directly subordinate agencies of the State Council conducted a thorough inspection of the current rectification movement. They are now seizing the opportunity to promote the further deepening of the rectification movement. The slogan they have put forward is: Work hard for a month, strive to be the best, and fully ensure the successful completion of the rectification movement.

    After the conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the Rectification Leadership Group of the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the directly subordinate agencies of the State Council immediately conducted a comprehensive inspection of the progress of the rectification movement in its eighteen subordinate units. Based on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, they made specific arrangements regarding the requirements, methods, and steps for carrying the rectification through to the end. After inspecting the rectification movement, the Rectification Leadership Group believes that most units, after concentrating on "spiritual work," have found or solved the key problems in their units, and leadership styles and methods have been greatly improved. However, this inspection also revealed that a few units, due to the lax leadership of leading cadres over the rectification and the lack of proper arrangements for the rectification and their work, had not engaged in deep and thorough "spiritual work," and the rectification work was not keeping up. In order to win a complete victory in the rectification movement, the Rectification Leadership Group of the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the directly subordinate agencies of the State Council required all units to continue to adhere to the principle of the top leader taking charge, strengthening specific leadership and overall planning, and ensuring that all units carry the rectification through to the end.

    Currently, all units have universally conveyed the main spirit and content of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to all personnel, and all units have made new and comprehensive plans to carry the rectification through to the end. At the same time, the Rectification Leadership Group Office has also increased its staffing. They leave the office every day to understand the situation in the subordinate units, conduct inspections, and study the situation as intensely as if they were fighting a battle every night, further proposing opinions to promote the movement. This has enabled both the advanced units and the units with slower progress in the rectification movement to move forward. For example, the Bureau of Foreign Experts slackened somewhat during the "spiritual work" in the previous stage. A few days ago, the bureau made a new plan to "work hard for a month to successfully complete the rectification," and based on further "spiritual work" combined with studying the General Line, it is deeply resolving three key issues: the leadership system, management methods, and service ideology.

　　保证整风运动善始善终
    人大常委会办公厅国务院直属机关加强对整风的领导
    本报讯　全国人民代表大会常委会办公厅和国务院各直属机关根据“八大”第二次会议的精神对当前的整风运动进行了一次深入检查以后，目前正抓紧时机促进整风运动进一步深入发展。他们提出的口号是：苦战一月，力争上游，全力保证整风运动善始善终。
    “八大”第二次会议结束以后，人大常委会办公厅、国务院直属机构整风领导小组立即对所属十八个单位的整风运动进展情况作了一次全面检查，并且根据“八大”第二次会议的精神，对如何把整风坚持到底的要求、方法和步骤作了具体部署。经过对整风运动的检查，整风领导小组认为，多数单位经过集中“务虚”以后，都已找到或者解决了本单位的关键问题，领导作风和领导方法有了很大改进；但是，这次检查也发现少数单位由于领导干部对整风的领导抓得不紧，对整风和业务没有做好妥善的安排，因而“务虚”不深不透，整改工作也跟不上。为了争取整风运动的全胜，人大常委办公厅、国务院直属机构整风领导小组要求各单位在目前都要继续坚持第一把手挂帅，加强具体领导和全面规划，保证一切单位都把整风坚持到底。
    现在，各单位已普遍向全体人员传达了“八大”二次会议的主要精神和内容，所有单位都作出了把整风进行到底的新的全面规划；同时，整风领导小组办公室还增加了新的人员力量，他们每天走出办公室，深入所属单位了解情况，进行检查，每晚都要像作战一样紧张地研究情况，进一步提出促进运动的意见。这样，就使整风运动先进的单位和进展比较迟缓的单位都在前进。例如，外国专家局在前一阶段的“务虚”中有些松劲，前几天这个局已重新作出“苦干一月胜利结束整风”的规划，并且结合学习总路线，在进一步“务虚”的基础上，深入解决领导体制、管理方法与服务思想等三个关键问题。
