(Reported by this newspaper) Currently, in the main wheat-producing areas along the Yangtze and Yellow-Huai Rivers, farmers are engaged in a summer planting rush, day and night, immediately following the summer harvest.

This year, the summer harvest in various regions has been very rapid, generally shortening the harvest period by six or seven days compared to previous years, and the progress of summer planting is also fast. As of June 10th, Anhui Province had planted 5.2 million mu more of mid-season rice than in the same period last year, summer corn planting was 320,000 mu more than in the same period last year, and sweet potato planting was 1.05 million mu more than in the same period last year. Many agricultural cooperatives in Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and other provinces have put forward the resounding slogan of "Seize the harvest on sunny days, rush to plant on rainy days, never idle day or night, and strive for a bumper harvest," mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and setting off a high tide of summer planting. Farmers have reflected on the pace of this year's summer harvest and planting, saying:

	In the morning, a field of wheat,
	By noon, all gone without a trace;
	After a cup of tea,
	Green seedlings fill the field.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops, many areas have actively carried out plowing and fertilization to improve the quality of summer planting. In Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, of the 1.83 million mu of late autumn crops planted, more than 1.7 million mu were fertilized with more than 13,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Counties such as Nanzhao and Tongbai have basically eliminated planting on barren land. Of the more than 70,000 mu of late autumn crops rush-planted in Changge County, 46,000 mu received an average of 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and 28,000 mu were deeply plowed. Over 17,000 mu were plowed and sown, with some combining deep plowing with double-layer fertilization.

In order to seize the opportunity for early planting, various regions have made early labor plans, improved attendance rates, and promoted advanced tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. Before the summer harvest, material and technical preparations were also made. In Anhui Province, before the summer harvest, the fertilizer needed for 28.8 million mu of land had been delivered to the fields, totaling 54.1 billion dan of manure, accounting for about 70% of the amount to be delivered. Ningyang County, Shandong Province, delivered more than 300 million jin of base fertilizer to the fields before the summer harvest, and inspected and sun-dried more than 300,000 jin of seeds, repaired more than 19,000 pieces of farm implements, and trained more than 1,000 planters and technicians. In addition, cadres from various agencies, officers, soldiers, teachers, students, and urban residents have vigorously supported the summer harvest and planting.

During the summer planting, this year, many areas have expanded the area of multiple cropping based on improved water conservancy and fertilizer conditions. Shanxi Province plans to expand the summer multiple cropping area by 9 million mu, and Jincheng County will carry out multiple cropping on all 410,000 mu of wheat fields. Chaoyi County, Shaanxi Province, has decided to expand the multiple cropping area of wheat fields from 54% last year to 70% this year. Sanyuan County plans to expand the multiple cropping area of wheat fields by more than 230,000 mu, to further rationally utilize land and tap the potential of cultivated land. (Attached photo)

    长江以北广大地区农民昼夜突击
    夏种进度势如奔马
    本报讯目前主要产麦区，沿江和黄淮地区的广大农民，紧接着夏收正在昼夜突击夏种。
    今年各地夏收十分迅速，一般比往年收割期缩短了六、七天，夏种的进度又快。到6月10日止，安徽省中稻比去年同期多栽五百二十多万亩，夏玉米播种比去年同期多三十二万亩，甘薯栽插比去年同期多一百零五万亩。河南、陕西、江苏等省很多农业社提出了“晴天抢收，雨天抢种，日夜不闲，争取丰收”的响亮口号，调动广大群众的积极性，掀起了夏种的高潮。有农民反映今年夏收夏种的进度说：
    早上麦一片，
    中午全不见；
    喝完一杯茶，
    绿秧栽满田。
    为了争取夏播作物的丰收，许多地区积极进行了翻地、施肥，提高夏种的质量。河南省南阳专区已种的一百八十三万亩晚秋，其中一百七十多万亩，每亩施底肥一万三千多斤，南召、桐柏等县基本消灭了板种白地。长葛县抢种的七万多亩晚秋作物中，有四万六千亩，每亩平均施底肥二万斤，并有二万八千亩作到了深翻，一万七千多亩进行了犁地播种，部分并结合深翻进行双层施肥。
    为了争取早种，各地及早做好了劳动规划，提高出勤率，推广先进工具，大大提高了劳动效率。在夏收前，还做好了物质和技术等准备工作。安徽省在夏收前，有二千八百八十万亩地所需的肥料已经送到地头，共送粪五百四十一亿担，占应送粪数量的70％左右。山东省宁阳县在夏收前把三亿多斤底肥送到地头，并检查和翻晒三十多万斤种子，修好农具一万九千多件，训练了一千多名播种手和技术员。此外，各地机关干部、军官、士兵、教师、学生和城镇居民都大力支援了夏收夏种。
    在夏种中，今年很多地区在水利、肥料条件改善的基础上扩大了复种面积，山西省计划扩大夏季复种面积九百万亩，晋城县四十一万亩麦田将全部进行复种。陕西省朝邑县今年麦田复种面积决定在去年54％的基础上扩大到70％，三原县计划扩大麦田复种二十三万多亩，进一步合理利用土地，发挥耕地潜力。（附图片）
    四川郫县幸福二社小春作物获得丰收以后，社员们争取秋季大丰收的信心更高。这是社员们在进行早稻中耕锄草。
