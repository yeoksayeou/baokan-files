Production Record Board

Fujian Zini Cooperative
Early Rice Yields 1,300 Jin Per Mu

This newspaper reports: The youth production team of the Zini Agricultural Cooperative in Longxi County, Fujian Province, started harvesting early rice and reported good news. The 1.8 mu of early-season rice that was test-harvested on the 13th yielded a high of 1,300 jin and 5 liang per mu, an increase of 60% compared to last year, setting a new record for the highest per mu yield of early rice in southern Fujian. This year, this production team planted 12 mu of double-season high-yield rice. The early rice fields were generally deeply ploughed to a depth of one chi, with a large amount of river mud added to the surface of the ridges. The superior Nan Te No. 1 variety was selected, and early transplanting and dense planting were adopted. The amount of fertilizer used was also doubled compared to previous years. Special attention was paid to irrigation and drying the fields. After transplanting, the fields were irrigated frequently with shallow water, sometimes irrigating during the day and draining at night. When drying the fields, artificial small-scale irrigation was used, so the field mud was neither rotten nor hard, and the roots of the rice plants were firm. Although they were hit by a typhoon, the rice plants were still guaranteed not to fall, thus achieving a bumper harvest. The team also has two mu of first-class high-yield fields, which will be harvested within the week and are expected to yield 1,800 jin per mu.

Xusheng Cooperative
The mu and three fen of wheat managed by the cadres of the Xusheng Cooperative in Xiaoliang Township, Hejin County, Shanxi, yielded 2,123 jin per mu.

Qianjin Cooperative
The six mu and three fen of wheat experimental fields of the Youth Shock Team of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangqiu Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong, achieved a high yield of 1,853 jin per mu due to deep plowing to a depth of eight cun to one chi, increasing the seeding rate to 30 jin, watering eight times, and fertilizing eight times.

Qinjian Cooperative
The four mu, three fen and seven li of wheat of the Qinjian Cooperative in Ganjian Township, Hejin County, Shanxi, averaged 2,196 jin and three liang per mu.

Wuxing Cooperative
The three mu of high-yield wheat fields of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Zhang Shu'an Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong, yielded an actual output of 1,612 jin and five liang per mu.

Yuhuangmiao Cooperative
The one mu and eight fen of high-yield wheat experimental fields of the Yuhuangmiao Agricultural Cooperative in Heilongmiao Township, Liangshan County, Shandong, yielded an actual output of 1,460 jin per mu.

Songzhuang Cooperative
The twenty-one mu of high-yield fields of the Songzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Qingshui Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong, yielded 1,440 jin per mu.

Sino-Hungarian Friendship Cooperative
The nineteen mu of high-yield wheat of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Wulizhuang Township, Ziyang County, Shandong, yielded 1,000 jin per mu.

Jiti Cooperative
The forty mu of high-yield wheat of the Jiti Agricultural Cooperative in Heilongmiao Township, Liangshan County, Shandong, averaged 1,000 jin per mu.

Liangwang Cooperative
The thirteen mu of high-yield wheat of the Liangwang Agricultural Cooperative in Fushan Township, Ningyang County, Shandong, averaged 1,000 jin per mu.

Lianfeng Cooperative
The two and a half mu of peanut high-yield experimental fields planted by the Lianfeng Cooperative in Dongshan Township, Qiongshan County, Hainan District, Guangdong, were appraised and accepted by the township party committee and the technical station, yielding a total of 3,850 jin of green peanuts, with an average yield of 1,541 jin per mu. Among them, the high-yield one mu and five li yielded an average of 2,415 and a half jin per mu. In addition to implementing measures such as seed selection and increased fertilization, these two and a half mu of experimental fields also grasped the experience of dense planting, planting more than 2,000 more plants than ordinary fields (a total of more than 12,000 plants). At harvest, the plants with the most pods had up to 190 pods each, and the fewest had more than 50 pods each, with a general average of about 80 pods.

    福建紫泥社
    早稻亩产1300斤
    本报讯　福建省龙溪县紫泥农业社青年生产队早稻开镰，首报喜讯。13日试割的一亩八分早季水稻，每亩高产达一千三百斤又五两，比去年增产六成，首创目前闽南地区早稻最高亩产纪录。今年这个生产队种了十二亩双季丰产水稻。早稻田普遍深翻一尺，畦面复加了大量的河泥，选用南特号良种，采取了早插密植，用肥量也比往年增加一倍。灌溉和烤田尤其讲究，插秧后一直浅水勤灌，有时昼灌夜排。烤田时用人工小水灌浇，因而田泥不烂不硬，禾根牢固，虽遭受过台风的袭击，仍保证了稻禾不倒伏，因此获得丰收。该队还有两亩一类丰产田，周内即将收割，预计可达亩产一千八百斤。
