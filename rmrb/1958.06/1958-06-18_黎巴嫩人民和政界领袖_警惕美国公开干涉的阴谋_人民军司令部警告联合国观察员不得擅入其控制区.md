Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 17th: According to a Damascus radio broadcast on the evening of June 16th, fighting continued between the rebellious people of Beirut and government armed forces on the 16th, and many explosions were heard in various districts of Beirut.

While the rebellious people continue their armed struggle with government troops, the Lebanese people and many political leaders are vigilantly watching the American conspiracy to openly interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs under the guise of the United Nations.

According to a broadcast by the Voice of Free Lebanon radio station on the evening of June 16th, the Lebanese People's Army Headquarters has warned UN observers that they must obtain permission before entering areas under the control of the People's Army; otherwise, the People's Army will not be responsible for any encounters they may experience.

It is reported that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Oseiran issued a statement to the press saying that everyone can have his own interpretation of the Security Council's resolution. As for us, we only have one interpretation: we will not allow any foreign troops from the United Nations or any other major power to land in Lebanon, regardless of its mission.

According to the "Al Anwar" newspaper report on June 17th, the Lebanese National Congress Party reiterated in a statement: "The Lebanese situation can only be resolved by the Lebanese people within Lebanon, and the decision made by various political parties to demand Chamoun's resignation is the only way to resolve this crisis."

Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Hussein Oueini said: "We will fight against any interference in Lebanese affairs."

The "Al Balad" newspaper quoted Lebanese opposition parliamentarian Anwar al-Khatib as saying at a press conference held in Beirut on June 17th that the opposition parties now insist on ending the current regime. He said that the opposition parties will not recognize any orders issued by Chamoun, including the order to dissolve political parties.

According to the "Al-Nasr" newspaper report on June 17th, U.S. Army officers are now training members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party to use new American weapons. The newspaper said that recently some British planes arrived at the Riak airport south of Baalbek, carrying some British officers in plain clothes.

The "Al Ray Al Aam" newspaper reported on June 17th that Chamoun held talks on the 16th with the British and Turkish ambassadors and the chargé d'affaires of the Iraqi embassy in Lebanon.

According to a broadcast by the Voice of Free Lebanon radio station, the People's Army had detained a car of the Iraqi embassy in Lebanon carrying a large number of weapons and some documents. The radio station said that the People's Army also confiscated 110,000 Lebanese pounds from the car.

According to the "Al Anwar" newspaper report on June 17th, Chamoun ordered on the 16th to prohibit foreign journalists from sending any news unfavorable to the government regarding the situation in Beirut.

    在起义人民同政府部队继续进行武装斗争的同时，黎巴嫩人民和许多政界领袖正在注意警惕美国企图借联合国名义公开干涉黎巴嫩内政的阴谋。

    据报道，黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰向报界发表声明说，每个人对安全理事会的决议都可以有他自己的解释。至于我们，却只有一种解释，即：我们不允许任何来自联合国或其它任何一个大国的外国军队在黎巴嫩登陆，不管它的任务如何。
    据“光明报”17日报道，黎巴嫩国民大会党在一项声明中重申：“黎巴嫩局势只能由黎巴嫩人在黎巴嫩国内来解决，而各政党作出的要夏蒙辞职的决定是解决这个危机的唯一办法。”
    反对党领袖、前总理侯赛尼·乌埃尼说：“我们将同任何干涉黎巴嫩事务的行为进行斗争。”
    “巴拉达报”17日引用黎巴嫩反对党议员安瓦尔·哈提卜在贝鲁特举行的一次记者招待会上的话说，各反对党现在坚持要结束现政权。他说，各反对党将不承认夏蒙所发布的一切命令，包括解散各政党的命令。
    据“胜利报”17日报道，美国陆军军官们现在正在训练国家社会党徒使用美国新式武器。这家报纸说，最近有一些英国飞机到达巴尔贝克南部的里阿克机场，载来了一些穿着便服的英国军官。
    “舆论报”17日报道，夏蒙在16日同英国和土耳其两国大使以及伊拉克驻黎巴嫩大使馆代办举行了会谈。
    据自由黎巴嫩之声电台广播，人民军曾经扣留了伊拉克驻黎巴嫩大使馆的载有大量武器和一些文件的汽车。电台说，人民军还从汽车上没收了十一万黎巴嫩镑。
    据“灯塔报”17日报道，夏蒙16日下令禁止外国记者发出任何不利于政府的有关贝鲁特情况的消息。
