    It's Better to Have No Books Than to Blindly Believe Them
    Wang Zugao
    We advocate reading some books seriously, but we also oppose blindly believing in books.

    However, in real life, there are indeed some people who worship books to the ground. Regardless of whether a book is good or bad, whether the principles and conclusions in it are right or wrong, whether it is outdated or not, whether it is suitable for the specific situation at that time and place or not, they regard it as the golden rule and dare not doubt it in the slightest, let alone develop and improve it. In the eyes of these people, what is not mentioned or recorded in ancient and modern Chinese and foreign books should not be said by him, so he dare not say or mention it. The formula for these people is: what is said in the book is—correct; what is not said in the book—cannot be said. In short, books determine everything.

    When Xu Zuying, a worker at the Shanghai Huafu Fountain Pen Factory, wanted to reduce the gold-plating content on the pen case of a fountain pen from 92% and catch up with the pen case of the American Parker fountain pen in terms of color and luster, the head of the factory's technology department said: "There is no theoretical basis for this in Chinese and foreign books." Listen to how confident he is. It is only because books support them. The basis for these people is not the living objective reality, but books.

    In real life, however, there are more people who start from objectively existing actual things and do not blindly believe in books. Li Shimei, an expert in termite prevention and control, said at a report meeting at Peking University: "I bought many Chinese and foreign books on termite prevention and control and found that many of the things said in the books were different from the actual situation I observed, so I became suspicious. After research, I did not completely believe the conclusions in the books." Li Shimei was not intimidated by the works of experts and scholars, but through the path of hard practice, with the support of the Party and the government, mastered the life rules of termites and found a set of methods to eradicate termites. This spirit of Li Shimei, who broke the blind belief in books and went to occupy materials in detail, and then carried out serious scientific analysis and research, this spirit of treating books with a revolutionary critical spirit is so valuable. He did not pick up some things piecemeal from foreign or domestic old paper piles, but was purposeful and finally came to the correct conclusion and solved practical problems.

    Some of our scientists and professors conduct scientific research "from magazines to magazines," which is completely contrary to Comrade Li Shimei's method of coming from the masses and going to the masses.

    Blindly believing in books, not daring to say what is not said in books, not daring to mention what is not mentioned, how can science and technology and cultural undertakings be developed and improved? How can new books continue to be produced? How can we better solve the practical problems that are not mentioned in the books but are urgently required of us to solve in socialist construction?

    Our attitude towards books (excluding bad books) should be: both believing and not believing. We believe in what has been proven to be true through practice, and we do not believe in what is not. We cannot be satisfied with this. We must also continuously enrich the knowledge in books through practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding. Therefore, we must dare to think about things that are not mentioned in the books. As long as we proceed from objective reality, occupy materials in detail, and are guided by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, we can draw correct conclusions from these actual materials. This is by no means being arrogant or thinking wildly. It is precisely a kind of spirit of not being an ancient slave and daring to be a contemporary person.

    "It's better to have no books than to blindly believe them," this sentence is very reasonable.

    尽信书不如无书
    汪祖高
    我们提倡认真地读些书，但也反对迷信书本。
    但是，在现实生活中，确有那么一部分人对书本崇拜得五体投地。他们不管这本书是好是坏，书中的原理、结论是对是错，是过时还是不过时，是适合当时当地的具体情况还是不适合当时当地的具体情况，他们都奉为金科玉律，丝毫也不敢产生怀疑，更不用说去发展提高了。在这些人看来，古今中外的书上没有讲过的，没有记载过的，他就不应讲，因此也就不敢讲、不敢提。这些人的公式是：书上讲过的——没错；书上没讲过的——不能讲。总之，书本决定一切。
    上海华孚金笔厂工人徐祖英要把金笔的笔套上的镀金成分从92％降下来，在颜色和光泽方面要赶上美国派克金笔的笔套时，该厂技术科长却说：“这在中外书籍里都找不到理论根据的”。你听，这口气多么理直气壮。只因为给他们撑腰的是书本。这些人的根据，不是活生生的客观实际，而是书本。
    现实生活中却有更多的人，他们是从客观存在的实际事物出发，不迷信书本。防治白蚁的专家李始美在北京大学的报告会上说：“我买了许多中外有关防治白蚁的书来看，发现书上说的许多地方与我观察到的实际情况不同，我就怀疑起来。经过研究，我没有完全信书上的结论。”李始美并没有被专家学者的著作所吓倒，而是通过刻苦实践的道路，在党和政府的支持下，掌握了白蚁的生活规律，找到了根除白蚁的一套方法。李始美这种破除对书本的迷信，而去详细地占有材料，然后进行认真的科学的分析研究的精神，这种用革命的批判的精神对待书本的精神是多么可贵。他没有从外国或本国的故纸堆中零星地捡些东西来，而是有的放矢，最后得出正确的结论，解决了实际问题。
    我们还有些科学家和教授的科学研究是“从杂志上来，到杂志上去”，这与李始美同志的从群众中来，到群众中去的方法是完全背道而驰的。
    迷信书本，书上没有说过的不敢说，没有提过的不敢提，这样科学技术和文化事业又如何得到发展和提高呢？新的书又怎能不断产生呢？又怎能更好地解决书上没有提过的而社会主义建设中迫切要求我们解决的实际问题呢？
    我们对待书本（坏书除外）的态度应该是：既相信又不相信。凡是通过实践证明是真理的则相信，反之则不相信。我们还不能以此为满足，我们还要通过实践、认识，再实践、再认识，不断地丰富书本上的知识。因此，我们就要敢于去想书上没有讲过的东西，只要我们是从客观实际出发，详细地占有材料，在马列主义一般原理的指导下，是可以从这些实际材料中得出正确的结论的。这决不是妄自尊大，胡思乱想。正是不作古奴，敢为今人的一种气魄。
    “尽信书不如无书”，这句话是很有道理的。
