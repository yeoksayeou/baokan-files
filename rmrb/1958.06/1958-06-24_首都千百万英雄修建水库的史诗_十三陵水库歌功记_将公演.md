    Epic of Millions of Heroes in the Capital Building a Reservoir
    "Ode to the Miyun Reservoir" to be Performed
    (Our Dispatch) The heroic deeds of the people of the capital in building the Miyun Reservoir will soon be brought to the stage. The twelve-scene new-style drama "Ode to the Miyun Reservoir" will be premiered before "July 1st" as a gift to celebrate the completion of the Miyun Reservoir and the 37th anniversary of the Party.
    Playwright Tian Han, together with literary and art workers in the capital, was deeply moved by participating in this great labor. In order to praise this great socialist project and the millions of heroes in the construction, he completed this large-scale script in just one week. The actors of the China Youth Art Theater, who participated in voluntary labor at the Miyun Reservoir construction site with Tian Han, also immediately guaranteed to rehearse this script in one week.
    The play begins with the construction of mausoleums during the feudal dynasties of Yuan and Ming, and continues to describe the twenty years after the completion of the reservoir. The playwright, with his revolutionary optimism, romanticism, and rich imagination, presents the past, present, and future of the Miyun Reservoir to the audience. Through many heroic figures and complex plots, it shows the great will of the Chinese people and the soaring enthusiasm under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction.
