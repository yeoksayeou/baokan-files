(Our newspaper's Hengyang dispatch on June 27th) Hunan Province is about to reap a great harvest of early rice. According to the recent assessment of the province's 20 million mu of early rice by the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee's Summer Production Inspection Meeting, the average yield of early rice in the province this year will reach 550 jin per mu. The total output of early rice will reach over 11 billion jin, more than double the total output of early rice last year. One million mu of early rice in the province will achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. At this meeting, the Provincial Party Committee called on the people of the province to continue to exert their efforts, increase measures to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, and on the basis of systematically summarizing the experience of high-yield early rice, strive for late rice to surpass early rice, and one season of intermediate rice to compete with two seasons, so that the province's early, intermediate, and late rice will achieve a balanced and large increase in production, breaking through the province's original leap forward targets for grain production.

The growth of early rice in Hunan Province this year is better than in any previous year in history. In Liling County, a famous double-cropping rice producing area, the 490,000 mu of early rice seedlings are generally four chi tall, with rice ears reaching seven or eight cun in length. Most of the rice is currently in the grain-filling stage, and some has already begun to scatter seeds. According to inspection and assessment, the average yield of early rice in the county this year could reach over 800 jin per mu, an increase of nearly double the average yield of early rice last year. This year, twelve townships and more than 280,000 mu of early rice in the county will reach over 1,000 jin per mu. The Dongting Lake area, known as a granary, will greatly change its low-yield appearance this year, and the average yield of early rice is expected to reach 550 jin per mu. The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which has always been considered to have a late season and poor conditions, has some areas where the early rice is better than that of the lake area and the hilly area, and the average yield is expected to reach 600 jin per mu.

The imminent bumper harvest of early rice is the result of the province's farmers implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Since last winter and this spring, the province has built and repaired more than 1.2 million water conservancy projects, including three times as many reservoirs as built since liberation, expanding the irrigated area by more than 2.6 million mu and improving the drought resistance capacity of more than 18 million mu of paddy fields. The province has accumulated 35 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average of 600 dan of fertilizer applied per mu, five times more than last year. Advanced technical measures such as deep plowing and close planting have been universally implemented in the province's early rice fields, with an average of about 30,000 rice seedlings per mu, also an increase of four or five times compared with previous years. Since the beginning of spring, the province's farmers have also overcome several cold waves and more than 20 days of continuous rain, and eliminated most insect pests. All of these have created favorable conditions for a bumper harvest and increased production of early rice. In Huangdong Township, Changning County, more than 70% of the 2,500 mu of rice has been planted with 100,000 seedlings, with a planned yield of over 2,000 jin per mu. In the experimental field of the secretary of Qinren Township in this county, 400,000 seedlings were planted per mu, with a planned early rice yield of 7,000 jin per mu, and two seasons reaching 14,000 jin, striving to become the world's highest record. For example, the Dacheng No. 1 Cooperative in Yongxing County plans to produce 30,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu this year, striving for 50,000 jin, of which the high-yield experimental field requires a yield of 120,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu.

In view of the promising bumper harvest of early rice in the province, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee requires all localities to continue to overcome various natural disasters, do a good job in field management, and ensure a bumper harvest and increased production. At the same time, because the province still has 20 million mu of intermediate rice and more than 16 million mu of late rice still being cultivated, efforts should be made to increase the production of these more than 36 million mu of intermediate and late rice.

    湖南早稻将增产一倍以上
    平均亩产可达550斤
    本报衡阳27日电　湖南省各地早稻即将获得大丰收。根据最近中共湖南省委夏季生产大检查会议对全省二千万亩早稻的鉴定，今年全省早稻平均亩产将达到五百五十斤。早稻总产量将达一百一十亿斤以上，比去年早稻总产量增加一倍以上。全省将有一百万亩早稻亩产达到一千斤。省委在这次会议上号召全省人民，继续鼓足干劲，增加措施，确保早稻丰收，并在系统地总结早稻丰产经验的基础上，力争晚稻超过早稻，一季中稻与两季比赛，使全省早中晚稻实现平衡大增产，突破全省原定的粮食生产跃进指标。
    今年湖南省的早稻生长情况比历史上任何一年都好。著名的双季稻产地醴陵县四十九万亩早稻禾苗，一般都有四尺来高，禾穗长达七八寸。现在大部分正在灌浆，一部分已经兜头散籽，据检查鉴定，全县今年早稻平均亩产可达八百斤以上，比去年早稻平均亩产量增长接近一倍。这个县今年将有十二个乡，二十八万多亩早稻达到千斤以上。以粮仓闻名的洞庭湖地区，今年将大大地改变低产面貌，预计早稻平均亩产也可达到五百五十斤。历来被认为季节迟，条件差的大山区——湘西土家族苗族自治州，今年有些地方的早稻也赛过湖区和丘陵区，预计平均亩产可达六百斤。
    早稻即将获得丰产，是全省农民执行了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的结果。从去冬今春以来，全省共兴修和整修水利工程一百二十多万处，其中兴修的水库为解放以来的三倍，扩大了二百六十多万亩灌溉面积，提高了一千八百多万亩水田的抗旱能力。全省积肥达三百五十亿担，每亩平均下肥六百担，比去年增加五倍。全省早稻田普遍贯彻执行了深耕密植等先进技术措施，每亩禾苗一般在三万兜左右，比往年也增加四、五倍。全省农民在入春以后还战胜了几次寒潮的侵袭和二十多天的霪雨，消灭了大部虫害。所有这些都为早稻丰收增产创造了有利条件。常宁县黄洞乡二千五百多亩稻70％以上插了十万兜，计划亩产二千斤以上。这个县亲仁乡秘书的试验田一亩插了四十万兜，计划早稻亩产七千斤，两季达到一万四千斤，争取成为世界最高的纪录。又如永兴县大城一社今年计划亩产红薯保证三万斤，争取五万斤，其中高额丰产试验田要求亩产红薯十二万斤。
    中共湖南省委鉴于全省早稻丰收在望，要求各地继续战胜各种自然灾害，搞好田间管理，确保丰产丰收。同时由于全省还有二千万亩中稻和一千六百多万亩晚稻尚在培育，争取这三千六百多万亩中、晚稻的更多增产。
