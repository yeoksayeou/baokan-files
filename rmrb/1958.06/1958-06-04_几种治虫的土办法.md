Several Indigenous Methods for Pest Control

　　The efficacy of Corydalis bungeana is remarkable

　　In Dancheng County, Henan Province, the collection of "Corydalis bungeana" for manufacturing insecticidal liquid has yielded good results. Experiments have shown that one jin of toxic liquid (extracted by chopping and squeezing Corydalis bungeana) mixed with twenty-five jin of water can kill all aphids on trees. The masses praised this method, saying, "This method is really good, it can control pests and doesn't cost any money." The method of using Corydalis bungeana to control pests has been promoted throughout the county.

　　Eighteen Kinds of Indigenous Pesticides

　　Wengjiang Township in Pingjiang, Hunan Province, has summarized the local masses' indigenous methods of using wild poisonous weeds to kill insects, and has trial-produced eighteen kinds of pesticides that can cure general crop pests, with a pest mortality rate of over 96%.

　　The eighteen kinds of indigenous pesticides that have been manufactured are: Yellow vine, Artemisia keiskeana, tobacco stalks, daylily, Yangmei bark, poisonous garlic, smartweed, Ma Tiao, Pinellia ternata, South China arrow poison, poisonous cocklebur, Lycianthes lysimachioides, Dryopteris crassirhizoma, Chinese Angelica, lacquer tree, Flemingia philippinensis, Smilax china, and Chinese prickly ash. Among them, the first ten are the most effective. The manufacturing methods are generally divided into three types: powder, soak and decoction.

　　Using Sealing Methods to Treat Corn Borers

　　Hongcheng Second Cooperative in Xichengzi Township, Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, is adopting the method of tightly handling corn stalks to eliminate overwintering larvae. Last year, this cooperative stored 400,000 bundles of stalks, of which 200,000 bundles remain unused. In order to prevent the larvae in these stalks from turning into moths, they have begun to cover the stalk stacks and seal them with mud.

    几种治虫的土办法
    猫儿眼草真顶用
    河南郸城县采集“猫儿眼”制造杀虫药水，效果良好。试验结果，一斤毒液（用猫儿眼草剁碎挤出）兑二十五斤水，能杀死树上的全部蚜虫。群众赞扬这个办法说：“这种办法真好，又能治虫又不花钱。”这个社用猫儿眼治虫的办法，已经在全县各地推广了。
    十八种土农药
    湖南省平江瓮江乡，总结本地群众利用野生毒草杀虫的土办法，试制成十八种农药，能治农作物的一般虫害，杀虫死亡率在96％以上。
    已经制造出的十八种土农药是：黄藤、蒿桐青、烟秆、大黄花、杨梅树皮、毒大蒜、辣蓼、马条、法夏子、南蛇毒箭、毒苍子、黎奶根、管仲、血当归、山漆、千斤拔、破铜线、花椒。其中以前十种效果最为显著。制造的方法：一般分为粉剂、浸剂、煎剂三种。
    用封闭办法治玉米虫
    辽宁新金县西城子乡红城二社，采用抓紧处理玉米秸秆的办法，来消灭越冬幼虫。这个社去年收储秸秆四十万捆，除已用掉的外，还有二十万捆。为了不使这些秸秆里的幼虫变成蛾子，已开始把秸秆堆垛苫好，并用泥封闭起来。
