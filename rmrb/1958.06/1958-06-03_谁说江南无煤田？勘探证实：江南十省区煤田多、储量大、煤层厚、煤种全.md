Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd - Contrary to old theoretical deductions, the provinces south of the Yangtze River, which many geologists once believed were unlikely to have large coalfields, have since last year discovered and confirmed more than twenty coalfields rich in bituminous coal, lignite, anthracite, and coking coal. This has not only opened up new avenues for geological thinking but also provided very favorable conditions for changing the unbalanced distribution of China's coal industry.

　　These twenty-plus coalfields are distributed across ten provinces and regions: Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi, encompassing all provinces and regions south of the Yangtze River except for southern Jiangsu. In the past, old geologists had issued various pessimistic conclusions about the lack of coal in these provinces and regions. For example, Guizhou Province, now confirmed to have the largest coal reserves in the Southwest, was once described as a province where "no coal seam is three feet thick." Current exploration proves that in the large area west of Anshun and east of Panxian in western Guizhou alone, there are seven contiguous large coalfields with a total reserve of over 18 billion tons, approaching the total coalfield reserves of Henan Province. The coal seam thickness reaches six to ten meters, and the coal types are also complete. Guangdong Province, which was previously thought to only have anthracite, recently discovered a prime coking coalfield in Yangchun County. A large coalfield recently found in Longyan County, Fujian Province, is estimated to have reserves of 300 million tons based on preliminary estimates. Geological personnel have also found similar types of coalfield distributions in Yongchun to the east and Yongding to the south of this coalfield. Zhejiang, once called "mountain without mines," has also found a coal mine with substantial reserves this year in the Changxing-Guangde area bordering Anhui.

　　The geographical location of these newly discovered large coalfields is also very good, which is of great value for the development of local industry and transportation. For example, the Qianxi large coalfield and the Yongchuan and Yongren coalfields in Sichuan and Yunnan are all very close to the Panzhihua iron ore area and can be used as coking coal bases in the future. The newly discovered coking coalfields in Fengcheng, Jiangxi, and Shuangfeng, Hunan, can also rely on existing transportation lines to directly reach the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base.

　　Currently, most of these coalfields will be developed this year in conjunction with the great development of local industries. For example, the Quren coalfield in Guangdong has four pairs of mine shafts starting construction this year. When all are put into production, the coal production will be more than the province's total coal production last year.

### 谁说江南无煤田？勘探证实：江南十省区煤田多、储量大、煤层厚、煤种全

　　谁说江南无煤田？
　　勘探证实：江南十省区煤田多、储量大、煤层厚、煤种全
    据新华社2日讯  根据旧的理论推断，曾经被许多地质学家认为不可能找到大煤田的长江以南各省，自去年以来已经发现和证实了二十多个储量丰富的烟煤、褐煤、无烟煤和炼焦煤田。这样，不但为地质界打开了思路，同时也为改变我国煤炭工业分布不平衡的状态提供了非常有利的条件。
    这二十多个煤田分布在四川、云南、贵州、湖南、江西、安徽、浙江、福建、广东、广西十个省区，即除了江苏南部以外，包括了长江以南的所有省区。这些省区过去曾被旧的地质学家下过各种各样缺煤的悲观结论。例如已被证实为西南区煤炭储量最多的贵州省，曾被形容为“煤无三尺厚”的省份。现在勘探证明，仅在这个省西部安顺以西盘县以东大片地区内，就分布着七个相毗连的大煤田，总储量达一百八十多亿吨，接近于河南全省煤田的储量，煤层厚度达六公尺到十公尺，煤种也很齐。过去被认为只能有无烟煤的广东省，最近在阳春县境内也发现了一个主焦煤田。福建省龙岩县最近找到的一个大煤田，据初步估计储量就有三亿吨。地质人员还在这个煤田东部的永春、南部的永定两地，找到了同类型的煤田分布。曾被称为“无矿山”的浙江，今年在与安徽交界处的长兴广德地区，也已找到了一个蕴藏量较大的煤矿。
    这些新发现的大煤田的地理位置也很好，对于发展当地的工业和交通运输业有着很大价值。如黔西大煤田和四川永川、云南永仁等煤田，都离攀枝花铁矿区很近，将来可以作为炼焦煤基地。江西丰城、湖南双峰等地新发现的炼焦煤田，也都可以依靠现有的交通线直接到达武汉钢铁基地。
    现在，这些煤田大部分都将在今年结合地方工业的大发展得到开发。如广东曲仁煤田今年开工建设的矿井就有四对，全部投入生产后，煤产量比去年全省的煤产量还多。
