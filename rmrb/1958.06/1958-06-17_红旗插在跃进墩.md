Red Flag Planted on Leap Forward Pier

The No. 4 pier of the Sandaokan Yellow River Bridge is the most challenging pier of the bridge. The thousand-ton caisson has to penetrate layers of silt, quicksand, and gravel to be firmly placed in the heart of the Yellow River. Even a slight deviation could render months of work futile. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway project has been put on the back of a "Leap Forward" express train, compressing the caisson construction period from five months to two. People are secretly worried about this critical project: "No. 4 pier! You must not block the Leap Forward train's progress!" The task of the soldiers is to forge a path through difficulties. See how the red flag is planted on No. 4 pier!

The Sun Rises

The sun rises, the desert sun rises so early!

The "Steel First Company" soldiers are already on No. 4 pier greeting the sun. Five battlefronts are attacking the fortress. Sparks fly in the coffer dam as welders rush to weld steel components; a large model is being erected on the sand island with carpenters and steelworkers working together; a movable platform is being assembled, and a dredging bucket roams on the platform; in mid-air, brave soldiers climb on the gantry... This is a revolutionary parallel operation where an hour's work equals five hours' work, and five processes proceed simultaneously. No. 4 pier has become a non-stop working machine, each link connected to the next, one chasing another. Everyone has a battle plan, everyone is like a dragon entering the sea!

The soldiers say, "People on No. 4 pier are full of energy!"

The face of the desert is fickle. When a sandstorm arrives, the sun is snatched away by the dust-filled sky, and everything becomes dark. The gale makes it hard to stand, and the sand hits your face, making a "pat-pat" sound, drowning out voices, and blurring figures. On No. 4 pier, our soldiers are fighting valiantly! Xu Jicheng, the carpentry squad leader, has his face covered with sewage and sand, making his features unrecognizable, but he is still swinging his axe to assemble the caisson model. Xu Jicheng leads a group of brave carpenters who accomplish in fifteen hours what would normally take three to five days. Song Minglun, the steel reinforcement squad leader, this "living Luo Shengjiao" (a war hero), who once rescued a Korean family in the flames of the Cheongcheon River, now leads a group of steelworkers charging into the battle, closely following the carpenters. The political instructor picks up the phone in the caisson, and the real-time competition situation is broadcast through the microphone-loudspeaker, echoing in the sky above the Yellow River! National quotas and Leap Forward targets are being broken by our soldiers! New records and new creations are constantly emerging, shortening the preparation time for the caisson by two-thirds!

Sparks of Wisdom

The revolutionary competition has turned No. 4 pier into a red-hot furnace, and sparks of wisdom are rising straight into the sky. Our soldiers are daring young people who think and act boldly. In the past, forging two-ton steel plates could only produce one pile per day. Forger Li Quan came up with a major innovation, changing hot forging to cold pressing. In ten minutes, a crooked sheet pile can be pressed flat and straight. Engineers say it's worth promoting after assessing it.

Engineer Wang Yuzhu is a young engineer who can work alongside the soldiers. He doesn't just sit in the office making plans. He lives in the company and lives and works with the soldiers. He explains the construction organization and technical measures directly to the soldiers, discusses them with everyone, and the soldiers enrich him with their wealth of experience, creating a movable platform that doubles work efficiency. Previously, heavy work platforms were installed on the scaffolding inside the caisson. Setting up and dismantling the scaffolding three times took forty-five days. Wang Yuzhu and two engineers designed a movable platform suspended under the gantry with pulleys above and a discharge opening below. It can be raised and lowered at will for pouring concrete, dredging, and working inside the sinking caisson. Therefore, people say, "A versatile platform is equipped under a versatile gantry!"

Every drop of water forms a river. The twenty technical innovations that have appeared on No. 4 pier are promoting the project's Leap Forward again and again!

Where There is Difficulty, There is the Commander

The detachment leader lives in the "Steel First Company." He works here, he labors here. Late at night, the caisson suddenly collapses with sand and stops sinking. People are discussing it, but the detachment leader has already appeared in the caisson. He convenes an on-site meeting, listens quietly to the brief speeches of the commanders and technicians, summarizes and analyzes, and points out that the sand collapse is not terrible and is easy to control. However, this phenomenon shows that the friction between the caisson and the sand has increased, and the progress will be very slow if this continues. He immediately decides to add the second section of the caisson in advance to increase the pressure and speed up the progress...

Having dealt with railways for a long time, our commander is as familiar with bridges as he is with his own ten fingers. Ten years ago, the detachment leader led a company to repair the Songhua River Bridge. Jiang, the company commander, was a soldier in that company. In the ten years, they have fought all over the motherland, always maintaining their full vigor. Listen, if you press your pulse to them, you will hear the beating of the Yellow River Bridge—under the command of such a commander, No. 4 pier has overcome numerous difficulties, broken through one dangerous pass after another, and stands majestically on the Yellow River's rolling torrent. The key pier has become an iron pier, promoting the Baotou-Yinchuan section of the project. The harshness of nature and the complexity of technology have been conquered by our soldiers. The red flag is planted on this Leap Forward pier. (Includes image)

    红旗插在跃进墩
    三道坎黄河大桥四号墩，是大桥最艰险的一座桥墩。千吨重沉井要穿过层层淤泥、流沙、粒石，稳当地放到黄河心脏，稍稍偏歪，几个月时光便要付于流水。包兰线工程跨上了千里马，逼得沉井工期由五个月压缩到两个月，人们心底暗暗为这包兰线关键工程耽心：“四号墩啊！你可不能挡着大跃进火车向前奔……”。战士的工作是劈荆斩棘，请看红旗如何插在四号墩！
    太阳出来了
    太阳出来了，沙漠里的太阳起得好早！
    “钢一连”战士早早在四号墩上迎接太阳，五条战线向着碉堡进攻。围堰里火星四射，电焊工在抢焊钢件；沙岛上在竖立高大的模型，木工钢筋工交叉作业；活动平台在拼吊，挖泥斗在平台上游荡；半空中，勇敢的战士攀越在龙门架上……，这是平行作业的大革新，一个钟头做五个钟头工作，五道工序同时并进。四号墩变成了座工作不息的机器，一环扣一环，一个赶一个；个个都有作战方案，个个好比蛟龙入海！
    战士们说：“人到四号墩浑身都是劲！”
    沙漠的脸色变幻无常，风沙来了，太阳被漫天黄沙夺去，一时天昏地暗，暴风，刮得你站立不稳；黄沙，打得你脸上“扑扑”响，听不见话音，难分辨人影。四号墩上，我们的战士精神抖擞地搏斗！木工班长徐吉成被污水和沙土涂得面孔不见眉眼，他还在挥动大斧拼沉井模型，徐吉成率领一批勇敢的木工，十五个钟头内办了三、五天才能办成的事。钢筋组长宋明伦，这个“活罗盛教”，曾经在清川江畔的战火中抢救出一家朝鲜人，现在又率领一组钢筋工冲入阵地，猛追木工。指导员在沉井拿起电话，竞赛实况经过话筒——扩音器，震荡黄河上空！国家定额、跃进指标，给我们战士打破！不断的出现新纪录，新创造，将沉井准备工程时间缩短了三分之二！
    智慧的火花
    革命竞赛把四号墩的烘炉烧得通红，智慧的火花直上云霄，我们战士是敢想敢干的青年。往常熔锻冶锻两吨重的钢板，一天只能冶锻一棵，锻工李权来了个大革新，把热锻改为冷压，十分钟，一棵歪歪扭扭的板桩便压得平平整整，工程师鉴定后也说有推广价值。
    工程师汪玉珠是位能和战士一起干的青年工程师，他不是光坐在办公室里作计划，他住在连队和战士们生活劳动在一起；他把施工组织和技术措施直接讲给战士听，和大伙商量，战士们也用丰富的经验充实了他，创造了提高工效两倍的活动平台。以前，沉井里的脚手架上安着笨重的工作平台，沉井三拆三搭要四十五天，汪玉珠和两位工程师设计在龙门架下吊活动平台，上装滑车，下有漏口，可以随心升降，浇灌混凝土，挖泥沉井下作业，都可以使用，所以人们说：“万能的龙门架下配有万能的平台！”
    滴水汇成河，四号墩出现的二十项技术革新，促进工程进度跃进再跃进！
    哪里有困难指挥员在哪里
    支队长住在“钢一连”，他在这里办公，在这里劳动。深夜，沉井突然翻沙，不下沉了，人们正议论纷纷，支队长已经出现在沉井。他召集现场会议，静听着指挥员和技术人员的简短发言，归纳分析后指出，翻沙并不可怕，制止容易；但这种现象说明沉井和泥沙磨擦力加大了；这样下去进度很慢。他立刻决定：提前加上第二节沉井，加重压力，加快进度……。
    长期和铁路打交道，我们的指挥员熟悉桥梁如熟悉自己的十个手指。十年前，支队长率领一个连抢修松花江大桥，姜连长是这个连的战士。十年中他们转战祖国各地，一直保持着饱满的干劲，你听，按着他们脉搏，你会听到黄河大桥跳动的声音——，在这样的指挥员指挥下，四号墩经历重重艰难，冲破一道道险关，雄伟地耸立在黄河滚滚急流上了，关键墩成了铁墩，促进着包头—银川段工程。大自然的艰险，复杂的技术，一并为我们战士征服，红旗插在这座跃进墩上。（附图片）
