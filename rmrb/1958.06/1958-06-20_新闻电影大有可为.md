    News Films Have Great Potential
    Lin Bi
    News films have many advantages: they can quickly and timely reflect the vibrant spirit of the times, possess relatively clear political and militant characteristics, and they appear before the audience with realistic and moving images. Added to this are their characteristics of being short and concise, concentrated, and rich in content, which makes them a socialist art form beloved by the masses. Some viewers compare news films to "living newspapers" and "living magazines," and to "school classrooms" and "political textbooks," which is reasonable. Sitting in the news cinema, the audience can see the vivid achievements of socialist construction in all parts of our motherland and witness the boiling life in every corner. The audience is encouraged and gains strength from the films. Newsreels have become a powerful vanguard in the Party's propaganda work.
    There are still some obstacles to the screening and distribution of newsreels. Some cinemas that screen feature films are unwilling to add newsreels, which hinders newsreels from meeting the broad masses of viewers. Their reason is that adding newsreels prolongs the screening time, affects the number of screenings, affects revenue, etc. This is an erroneous view based solely on business income, without considering political propaganda. To further expand the propaganda effect of news films, we cannot rely solely on news cinemas, but must mobilize all cinemas and projection teams. The on-site meeting of news cinemas held by the Film Bureau in Tianjin requires cinemas and film projection teams in various places to screen them in a timely, regular, universal, and in-depth manner, screening them at every show and adding them to every show. But to achieve this, we must first liberate our thinking, put politics in command, and truly recognize the great political significance of the screening of newsreels and science education films.
    Our motherland is so large, and the landscape is so beautiful. This is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for news films. Especially when our country's socialist construction is developing with such magnificent momentum, the audience is even more eager to see this great era reflected. The tasks facing news films are also more arduous. Any statement that underestimates the role of news films is unfounded. News films are not only potentially useful, but have great potential. We wish the news film industry a bountiful harvest!

    新闻电影大有可为
    林碧
    新闻电影有着很多优点：它能迅速及时地反映生气勃勃的时代面貌，具有比较鲜明的政治性和战斗性，它以真实感人的形象出现在观众面前，又加上它的短小精悍、集中、内容丰富多采等特点，因此，它成为广大群众所热爱的一种社会主义艺术形式。有的观众把新闻影片比做“活报纸”、“活杂志”，比做“学校的课堂”和“政治教材”，这是有道理的。观众坐在新闻影院里就能够看到我们祖国各地的社会主义建设成就的形象。看到各个角落沸腾的生活，观众从影片中受到鼓舞、取得力量，新闻纪录影片已经成为党的宣传工作中的一支有力的尖兵。
    新闻纪录片的放映发行工作还有一些障碍。有些放映故事片的影院不愿意加映新闻影片，妨碍了新闻纪录片同广大观众见面，他们的理由是：加映新闻片就延长了放映时间，影响了放映场次、影响收入等等。这是单纯从营业收入出发的错误观点，没有从政治宣传上来考虑。要进一步扩大新闻电影的宣传效果，不能只靠新闻影院，还必须把所有影院、放映队发动起来。电影事业管理局在天津召开的新闻电影院工作现场会议，要求各地电影院、电影放映队及时、经常、普遍、深入地放映，场场放映，场场加映。但是做到这一点必须首先解放思想，政治挂帅，真正认识到新闻纪录影片和科学教育影片放映工作的重大政治意义。
    我们祖国如此之大，江山如此多娇，这正是新闻电影取之不尽、用之不竭的源泉，特别是我国社会主义建设事业正以波澜壮阔、一日千里之势发展的时候，观众更加要求把这个伟大的时代反映出来，摆在新闻电影面前的任务也更加繁重了。任何低估新闻电影作用的说法都是没有根据的。新闻电影不是小有可为，而是大有可为，我们预祝新闻电影事业的丰收！
