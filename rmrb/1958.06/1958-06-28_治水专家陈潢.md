Greatness from the Ordinary

    Water Conservancy Expert Chen Huang
    Chen Huang, a water conservancy expert from a commoner background in the Qing Dynasty of China, invented a water measurement method based on on-site observation. In today's terms, the "water measurement method" is a method of measuring water flow velocity and flow rate. This was an important contribution at the time (17th century).
    Chen Huang once said: "When encountering narrow river surfaces, or when there are towns and hills along the banks that cannot be opened up, I survey the terrain upstream and downstream, and build more rolling water gates and culverts to discharge the excess water into ditches. Using the principle of measuring earthwork to measure water, it is necessary to ensure that the amount of water discharged is equal to the excess floodwater, so that the turbulent waves can be calmed down." This is a penetrating insight. Chen Huang devoted most of his life to harnessing the Yellow River, and his ideal was to fundamentally control the Yellow River and seek benefits for millions of people. However, his ideal was not realized at that time. Only in today's liberated China is it possible for the fundamental control of the Yellow River to be transformed from an ideal into reality.

    治水专家陈潢
    我国清代平民出身的治水专家陈潢，根据实地观察发明了测水法。用今天的话来说，“测水法”就是测量水的流速和流量的方法。这在当时（十七世纪）是一项重要贡献。
    陈潢曾经说：“遇到河面窄狭的地方，或是沿岸有城镇山岗不可开辟的时候，我就在其上下游勘察地形，多建滚水闸坝和涵洞，把过涨的水泄入沟渠。用测土方的道理转而测水，一定要使泄水的数量和过涨的洪水相等，这样惊涛怒浪就可以平缓下来。”这是一个精辟的见解。陈潢把一生的主要力量都放在治理黄河上，他的理想是：根治黄河，为千千万万人民谋福利。然而他的理想在当时并没有实现，只有在解放了的今天，根治黄河才有可能由理想变成现实。
