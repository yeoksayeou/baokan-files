　　Bi-Monthly International Review
    From May 19th to June 4th

    After the Soviet Union launched its third red giant star into space, it caused a huge response internationally. Even the Western bourgeois press admitted that the Soviet Union had far surpassed the United States in some extremely important and decisive scientific and technological fields, and that the United States would not be able to catch up in the short term. The recent meetings of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states in Moscow further demonstrated the solidarity and strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation of the socialist camp. The socialist camp steadfastly safeguards peace, and its international prestige has greatly increased.

    The head of the imperialist camp, the United States, is still experiencing a deepening economic crisis, which is spreading to other capitalist countries. Class struggles within imperialist countries have intensified, and contradictions between imperialist countries are expanding, with some countries experiencing profound social unrest. The results of elections in many capitalist countries show that reactionary forces are even more unpopular, and peaceful and democratic forces have received more votes. The struggles of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for the maintenance of peace continue to impact the imperialist camp.

    These facts show that the socialist cause is thriving, the difficulties and contradictions within the imperialist camp are deepening, and the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind.

    Two Meetings of Solidarity and Cooperation

    The two meetings held recently in Moscow by representatives of the fraternal parties and governments of the Soviet Union and European socialist countries—the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states—are the most prominent events of this half-month.

    The meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance was held from May 20th to 23rd. In addition to the representatives of the eight member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, representatives of the Communist Party of China, the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party were also invited to attend the meeting.

    The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is a comprehensive economic cooperation organization established by the Soviet Union and European socialist countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, and socialist mutual assistance. For nearly ten years, the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance have developed fraternal economic cooperation through the coordination of national economic plans, equal and mutually beneficial trade, the provision of preferential long-term loans, various enterprise equipment, and technical assistance from economically advanced countries to other fraternal countries, the exchange of technical data, and the exchange of advanced experiences. This has played a significant role in promoting the common upsurge of socialist economic construction in various countries.

    The meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance was held in a situation where the scale of socialist construction in various countries and the economic ties between countries have greatly expanded. In this situation, it is obviously very important to further improve the forms of economic cooperation between countries in the socialist camp and to better implement specialization and collaboration in the relevant departments of the national economy. The new guidelines for further developing and strengthening the international division of labor among countries in the socialist camp formulated at this meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance aim to ensure the most rational use of natural resources and economic resources, improve labor productivity, and create greater material welfare for the people of all countries. The rational organization of economic cooperation among countries in the socialist camp will inevitably accelerate the development of productivity in various countries and better exert the economic power of the entire socialist camp.

    The meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states put forward new common tasks for the current struggle for world peace and security. The declaration of this meeting solemnly announced that they would do everything possible to unswervingly defend the cause of peace and fight to stop a new war, and proposed to conclude a treaty of mutual non-aggression with the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The meeting also decided that the Warsaw Treaty member states would continue to reduce their armed forces by 419,000 people in 1958; and agreed to the Soviet Union's decision to withdraw its troops from Romania in the near future and to reduce the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary by another division in 1958. This declaration and these major measures are new efforts and contributions made by the Warsaw Treaty member states to strive for world peace and ease international tensions. After the meeting, the Soviet Union and European socialist countries made new efforts to promote the early realization of a summit meeting and the cessation of nuclear testing.

    In the past three years, the Warsaw Treaty has made great contributions to ensuring the security of the contracting states and world peace. This treaty was signed for self-defense after the aggressive North Atlantic Group was formed. After the signing of the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet Union and other contracting states still actively advocated the abolition of the existing military groups in Europe and the establishment of a European collective security system, and later proposed the conclusion of a treaty of mutual non-aggression between the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, these reasonable proposals for peace were all rejected by the United States and its followers. In this way, the Soviet Union and other European socialist countries further strengthened the power of the Warsaw Treaty in order to ensure their own security and world peace, making it impossible for the war schemes of the North Atlantic aggressive group to be realized. The argument that the root cause of international tension is due to the existence of two opposing military and political groups is obviously an intentional reversal of black and white to defend the aggressive policies of Western imperialism.

    The two meetings held in Moscow are the most vivid manifestation of the solidarity, vigorous development, and continuous strengthening and consolidation of socialist countries in all aspects.

    The Economic Crisis in the Capitalist World Continues to Deepen

    In sharp contrast to the situation in the socialist camp, the imperialist camp is fraught with difficulties. The economic crisis in the United States not only shows no signs of abating, but has also affected many other capitalist countries and raw material exporting countries.

    Due to the continued deepening of the economic crisis in the United States, the demand for raw materials has decreased and prices have plummeted, which has caused economic and financial crises in many raw material exporting countries in the capitalist world. For example, Chile's copper exports, according to the current situation, will decrease by 225 million U.S. dollars this year and will cause Chile's trade deficit to reach 95 million U.S. dollars. Bolivia's foreign exchange income is 80% dependent on the export of raw materials such as tungsten, tin, lead, and zinc to the United States, but now the prices of these raw materials have fallen by 30%, which has caused a great blow to its economy. Due to the United States' restrictions on oil imports, Venezuela's oil exploitation has decreased by 14%, causing the country to lose 250,000 U.S. dollars in revenue every day. The large-scale closure of tin mines in Malaya is mainly due to the reduction of imports by the United States. Currently, Malaya's tin exports have decreased by 50%, and 25% of the tin mines have closed down. Pakistan's jute and Indonesia's rubber have both suffered economic difficulties due to reduced exports. Regarding this situation, the recent issue of the American "Time" magazine bluntly stated that countries affected by the American economic crisis cannot hold any hope for the United States, because the United States not only does not intend to increase the number of raw material purchases, but also prepares to establish new tariff barriers on raw material imports.

    In order to ensure the interests of monopoly capital and expand commodity exports, the United States is taking measures to shift the economic crisis to other capitalist countries. Recently, the so-called "Foreign Aid Amendment" being醞酿 in the U.S. Congress is one of these measures. This amendment stipulates that the materials purchased by other capitalist countries using the funds of the International Cooperation Administration in the past should in principle be purchased domestically in the United States in the future, and only 50% can be purchased abroad if it does not affect domestic industry in the United States. This is actually a complete ban on purchasing abroad,打击 other commodity exporting countries. In this way, the contradictions between the economic interests of the United States and other capitalist countries are becoming more and more obvious. At the same time, the struggle for markets among major capitalist countries is愈演愈烈.

    As the economic crisis continues to deepen, the number of unemployed in the capitalist world is不断增长. In the first quarter of this year, the number of unemployed in the United States and Canada reached the highest record since the war, and the number of unemployed in Australia, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden also reached the highest record in the past five years. The number of unemployed in Japan, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries has increased significantly. Even in capitalist countries such as Sweden and Switzerland, which have always been considered economically relatively "stable", the number of unemployed has increased in recent months.

    The situation in the capitalist world is very不美妙. The工潮 in many countries are expanding, and they are shouting slogans demanding work and survival. This shows that the class struggle in capitalist countries has intensified. Regarding this situation, the United Nations "International Labor Organization", which recently held a meeting in Geneva, also said in a report with worry that the poverty, pain, and颓丧 caused by the economic crisis in the capitalist world, if developed, will cause people to普遍对资本主义的经济制度和社会制度的幻想破灭.

    The Political Situation in France is Still in Turmoil

    The difficulties and chaos in the imperialist camp are also manifested in the recent fierce struggle between the French people's democratic forces and the fascist forces. De Gaulle, who is supported by the extreme right wing of the French bourgeoisie and the fascist forces, gained a majority in the authorization vote in the National Assembly on June 1 and took power. However, the French people's struggle to defend peace, democracy, and freedom continues. The political situation in France is still in turmoil.

    De Gaulle's acquisition of "legitimate power" through parliamentary means this time, as Mitterrand, one of the leaders of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, pointed out, is merely a formality; because, "in fact, he has already seized this power through the illegal actions of the army." After the military coup in Algeria on May 13, Corsica also experienced a rebellion on May 24. In addition, instability is developing among senior military generals. It was in this situation that the so-called bourgeois "middle" parties, including the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party, succumbed to De Gaulle. On May 28, the Pflimlin government, which had been in power for only half a month, resigned despite receiving the support of the majority of the National Assembly. This opened the door for De Gaulle to take power.

    Not only that, even in the so-called "legal" actions, the principles of democracy have been wantonly破坏. On May 27, before Pflimlin had resigned, De Gaulle publicly issued a statement saying that he had begun the "necessary formal procedures" for organizing a government, and issued a notice to the Algerian rebels in the tone of a head of government. And French President Coty, regardless of his status as head of state, personally came forward to work for De Gaulle. He abandoned the normal cabinet-forming procedures and instead of De Gaulle wooed the various bourgeois parties, and even used resignation as a means to force the National Assembly to support De Gaulle. From this series of situations, people can clearly see the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy and the parliamentary system.

    The result of the parliamentary vote cannot reflect the will of the French people. The French people have already shown through their actions that they firmly oppose De Gaulle's coming to power. After the rebellion in Algeria, the French people's struggle to defend peace, democracy, and freedom has vigorously开展起来了. On May 27, workers in various places held massive anti-fascist general strikes. On the 28th, a unprecedented large-scale parade with 500,000 people participating was held in Paris. When the National Assembly discussed the issue of De Gaulle's coming to power, workers and people from all walks of life in Paris and other cities held demonstrations and parades. In this struggle, the long-tested French Communist Party showed that it is a firm defender of peace, democracy, and freedom, and further raised its prestige among the French people. The unity of the working class has also been further strengthened.

    The will of the people, to a certain extent, has also affected the internal affairs of bourgeois political parties. Many parties have already fallen into serious分裂 on the issue of supporting De Gaulle. Within the Socialist Party, although the like of Mollet shamelessly奔走游说 for De Gaulle, the result was that 49 deputies voted against De Gaulle's coming to power in the National Assembly, while only 42 deputies supported De Gaulle. Within the Radical Socialist Party, the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, and the Popular Republican Movement, some deputies also cast negative votes in the authorization vote.

    After De Gaulle came to power, he immediately forced the National Assembly to pass three bills, deciding to grant the government special powers and allowing constitutional amendments to bypass the parliament. This is the beginning of an offensive against democracy. However, the French working class and the masses of the people are uniting around the French Communist Party, ready to counter the anti-democratic measures taken by De Gaulle. "The French people oppose all dictatorships! No military dictatorship can conquer the great French people!" These words spoken by French Communist Party leader Duclos are the common will and common determination of thousands of French people.

    The Lebanese People are Persisting in Fighting

    The armed uprising of the Lebanese people against imperialism and its agents has lasted for nearly a month. In the capital Beirut, the insurgents seized the Basta district from the beginning. In northern Lebanon, the insurgents controlled the entire area including the old city of Tripoli, Halba, and Jaba'in. In the Chouf Mountains in the central region, the troops of the Druze tribe have established a base. In the southern cities of Saida and Tel Majaron, there are strong rebel forces active. The patriotic people in Sidon, an important southern coastal city and the terminal of the Aramco oil pipeline, also launched an armed struggle on May 25.

    The pro-Western Chamoun government carried out bloody suppression of the insurgents. Government troops dispatched tanks and aircraft to attack towns controlled by the insurgents. The United States and its vassal countries have been grossly interfering in Lebanon since the beginning of the Lebanese people's uprising, assisting the Lebanese government forces in attacking the people. On May 18, planes piloted by American soldiers even bombed Tripoli. More than 1,000 active-duty American officers, dressed in civilian clothes, directly commanded the Lebanese security forces and the army. Former "Arab Legion" commander Glubb, who is currently serving as a senior advisor to the Baghdad Pact Group, also arrived in Beirut to plan a military offensive against the insurgents. In addition, thousands of Iraqi and Jordanian soldiers, under the direct command of the United States and Britain, have recently been airlifted to Beirut to participate in military operations to suppress the Lebanese patriotic people. However, imperialism and its agents have not achieved their goals. The insurgents, fighting bravely, have constantly repelled the government forces' attacks and still control large areas of Lebanon.

    In Lebanon, a country with a population of only 1.5 million, such a vigorous armed struggle against imperialism and its agents has taken place, which is an encouraging event. This event shows that the Lebanese people's political awareness is increasing day by day, and they deeply realize that Lebanon's national interests are irreconcilable with the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Therefore, they bravely took up arms and launched a resolute struggle against the Chamoun government, which is implementing imperialist policies. This event also shows that imperialism's prestige in the Middle East is increasingly declining, and the Middle Eastern people's movement against imperialism and for national independence is irresistible. Like the Egyptian people's struggle against imperialist aggressors and the Syrian people's struggle to crush imperialist war plans, the events currently taking place in Lebanon are another heavy blow to imperialism.

    Precisely because of this, the United States will not be reconciled to the development of the situation in Lebanon. It is调兵遣将, attempting to use the already bankrupt "Eisenhower Doctrine" and other excuses to further "take action" in Lebanon. This conspiracy activity has formed a threat to peace. At the same time, the United States is also vigorously carrying out political conspiracies, attempting to divide the various opposition parties and the broad masses of the people in Lebanon in order to preserve its aggressive forces in Lebanon. Under the direction of the United States, the Lebanese authorities recently proposed several so-called plans to reorganize the government, the purpose of which is to allow Chamoun to continue to serve as president. In addition, others have proposed other plans, demanding that the various opposition parties and the insurgents compromise with Chamoun. However, these plans have been rejected by the major opposition parties and the broad masses of the people. The major opposition parties and the broad masses of the people firmly demand Chamoun's resignation. They are persisting in fighting for this unanimous goal.

    The Lebanese people's struggle is also a struggle to defend peace. The United States and its followers want to play with fire in Lebanon, which cannot but arouse the serious attention of peace-loving countries. The Soviet people have expressed that they cannot ignore the new adventure plans of imperialism in the Middle East. The people of all countries in the world also support the Lebanese people's struggle. "Those who are virtuous receive much help," which is a very favorable condition for the Lebanese people to win victory.

　　半月国际述评
    从五月十九日到六月四日
    苏联第三颗红色巨星上天之后，在国际上引起了巨大反响。连西方资产阶级的报刊也承认，苏联在一些极其重要而具有决定意义的科学技术方面，已经远远地超过了美国，并且不是美国在短时期里所能够赶上的。最近在莫斯科举行的经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议和华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议，更表现了社会主义阵营团结一致，互助合作的加强。社会主义阵营坚定不移地维护和平，国际威望有了更大的增长。
    帝国主义阵营的首脑美国，经济危机仍在继续加深，并且正向其它资本主义国家蔓延。帝国主义国家内的阶级斗争已经加剧，帝国主义国家间的矛盾正在扩大，有的国家出现了深刻的社会动荡。许多资本主义国家大选的情况说明，反动势力更加不得人心，和平民主力量得到了更多的选票。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反对殖民主义和维护和平的斗争，继续冲击着帝国主义营垒。
    这些事实表明，社会主义事业蓬勃发展，帝国主义阵营内部的困难和矛盾日益加深，东风继续压倒了西风。
    两个团结合作的会议
    苏联和欧洲社会主义国家的兄弟党和政府的代表，最近在莫斯科举行的两个会议——经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议、华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议，是这半个月里最突出的事件。
    经济互助委员会的会议是5月20日到23日举行的。参加会议的除了经济互助委员会的八个成员国党的代表以外，中国共产党、越南劳动党、朝鲜劳动党和蒙古人民革命党的代表也应邀参加了会议。
    经济互助委员会是苏联和欧洲社会主义国家本着无产阶级国际主义的原则，并以完全平等、互相尊重民族利益和社会主义互助的原则为基础而建立的全面经济合作的组织。将近十年以来，经济互助委员会各成员国，通过国民经济计划的配合，平等互利的贸易，经济较先进国家对其他兄弟国家提供优惠的长期贷款、各种企业设备和技术援助，互换技术资料和交换先进经验等各种各样的方式，发展了兄弟般的经济合作。这对促进各国社会主义经济建设的共同高涨，起了很大的作用。
    这次经济互助委员会的会议，是在各国社会主义建设规模和各国之间的经济联系已经大大扩展了的情况下举行的。在这种情况下，进一步改进社会主义阵营各国经济合作的形式，使国民经济各有关部门更好的实行专业化和协作，显然是十分重要的。这次经济互助委员会的会议所制定的进一步发展和加强社会主义阵营国家的国际劳动分工的新方针，旨在保证最合理地利用天然资源和经济资源，提高劳动生产效率，为各国人民创造更大的物质福利。合理地组织社会主义阵营各国的经济合作，必将加速各国生产力的发展，更好的发挥整个社会主义阵营的经济威力。
    华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会的会议，对当前争取世界和平和安全的斗争提出了新的共同任务。这个会议的宣言庄严地宣布，它们将竭尽全力不懈地捍卫和平事业和为制止新战争而斗争，并且建议同北大西洋公约成员国缔结互不侵犯公约。会议还决定，华沙条约缔约国在1958年继续裁减武装部队四十一万九千人；并且同意了苏联在最近期间从罗马尼亚撤出驻军和在1958年把驻匈牙利的苏联军队再减少一个师的决定。这个宣言和这些重大措施，是华沙条约缔约国为争取世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势而作出的新的努力和贡献。在会议以后，苏联和欧洲社会主义国家为促使高级会议和停止核试验的早日实现，又作了新的努力。
    华沙条约在过去三年多的时间里，对于保障缔约国家的安全和世界的和平，已经作出了很大的贡献。这个条约是在侵略性的北大西洋集团组成以后，为了自卫而签订的。华沙条约签订以后，苏联和其他缔约国家仍然积极主张取消欧洲现有的军事集团，建立欧洲集体安全体系，后来又提出在华沙条约和北大西洋公约成员国之间缔结互不侵犯公约。但是，这些谋求和平的合理建议，一概遭到美国及其追随者的拒绝。这样，苏联和其他欧洲社会主义国家为了保障自身安全和世界的和平，进一步加强了华沙条约的力量，使北大西洋侵略集团的战争阴谋无法实现。那种认为国际紧张局势的根源是由于存在着两个对立的军事政治集团的说法，显然是有意颠倒黑白，为西方帝国主义的侵略政策辩护。
    在莫斯科举行的这两个会议，是社会主义国家在各方面团结一致，蓬勃发展和不断加强和巩固的最生动的表现。
    资本主义世界经济危机继续加深
    同社会主义阵营的情况恰好相反，帝国主义阵营内部困难重重。美国的经济危机不仅没有减退的迹象，而且已经波及到其他许多资本主义国家和原料出口国家。
    由于美国经济危机继续加深，原料需求减少，价格大跌，这就引起了资本主义世界许多原料出口国经济和财政的危机。如智利铜的出口，按照目前情况，今年将减少二亿二千五百万美元，并将使智利的贸易逆差高达九千五百万美元。玻利维亚的外汇有80％是靠向美国输出钨、锡、铅、锌等原料得到的，而现在这些原料已经跌价30％，这就使它的经济遭受很大打击。由于美国限制石油进口，委内瑞拉的石油开采量减少了14％，使这个国家每天要损失二十五万美元的收入。马来亚锡矿业大批倒闭，主要也是由于美国减少进口引起的。目前，马来亚锡的出口减少了50％，锡矿倒闭了25％。巴基斯坦的黄麻和印度尼西亚的橡胶都由于出口减少，而使这些国家遭到了经济困难。对于这种情况，最近一期的美国“时代”杂志直截了当地说，遭到美国经济危机影响的国家，对美国不能抱有什么希望，因为美国不仅不打算增加原料的采购数量，而且还准备对原料进口建立新的关税壁垒。
    美国为保证垄断资本的利益，扩大商品输出，正在采取措施，把经济危机转嫁到其他资本主义国家身上。最近，美国国会正在酝酿的所谓“对外援助修改案”，就是这种措施之一。这个修改案规定，过去一向使用国际合作署资金的其他资本主义国家采购的物资，今后原则上要在美国国内采购，只有在不影响美国国内工业的情况下，才可以在国外采购50％。这实际上是完全禁止在国外采购，打击其他商品出口的国家。这样，美国同其他资本主义国家经济利益的矛盾，就更加表面化了。同时，各主要资本主义国家之间争夺市场的斗争，也正在愈演愈烈。
    随着经济危机继续加深，资本主义世界的失业人数正在不断增长。今年第一季美国和加拿大的失业人数达到战后最高纪录，澳大利亚、英国、荷兰、挪威和瑞典等国的失业人数也达到了五年内的最高纪录。日本、菲律宾、马来亚等国失业人数都有大量增加。就是一向被认为经济比较“稳定”的瑞典和瑞士这样的资本主义国家，失业人数最近几个月也有了增加。
    资本主义世界的情况是很不美妙的。许多国家的工潮正在扩大，他们喊出了要求工作、要求生存的口号。这说明在资本主义国家里，阶级斗争已经加剧。对于这种情况，最近在日内瓦举行会议的联合国“国际劳工组织”在一份报告中也忧心忡忡地说，资本主义世界经济危机所造成的人民的贫困、痛苦和颓丧如果发展下去，就会引起人们普遍对资本主义的经济制度和社会制度的幻想破灭。
    法国政局仍在动荡中
    帝国主义阵营的困难和混乱也表现在最近法国人民民主力量和法西斯势力的激烈斗争上。受到法国资产阶级极右派和法西斯势力支持的戴高乐，6月1日在国民议会的授权投票中得到了多数而登台执政了。但是，法国人民保卫和平、民主和自由的斗争还在继续着。法国的政局仍然在动荡中。
    戴高乐这次通过议会途径取得“合法政权”，正如民主社会抵抗联盟的领袖之一密特朗所指出的，仅仅是一种形式罢了；因为，
  “事实上他已经通过军队的非法行动而掌握了这种政权”。在5月13日阿尔及利亚的军事政变以后，科西嘉岛在5月24日又发生了叛乱。此外，在高级的军事将领中，不稳的现象也在发展。正是在这种形势下，包括社会党右翼领导集团在内的所谓资产阶级“中间”党派向戴高乐屈服了。5月28日，上台才半个月的弗林姆兰政府在得到国民议会多数支持的情况下辞职不干了。这就为戴高乐的上台打开了大门。
    不但如此，即使在所谓“合法”的行动中，民主的原则也已经遭到了肆意的破坏。5月27日，弗林姆兰还没有辞职，戴高乐居然就公开发表声明，说他已经开始了组织政府的“必要的正规程序”，并且以政府首脑的口气向阿尔及利亚的叛乱分子发出通告。而法国总统戈蒂，也不顾国家元首的身份而亲自出马为戴高乐效劳。他背弃了正常的组阁程序而代替戴高乐对各个资产阶级政党进行拉拢，甚至还以辞职作为手段来迫使国民议会支持戴高乐。从这一系列的情况中，人们可以清楚地看到资产阶级民主和议会制度的虚伪性。
    议会的表决结果，决不能反映法国人民的意志。法国人民已经用行动表明，他们坚决反对戴高乐上台。在阿尔及利亚的叛乱发生以后，法国人民保卫和平、民主和自由的斗争就蓬勃地开展起来了。5月27日，各地工人举行了声势浩大的反法西斯总罢工。28日，巴黎举行了有五十万人参加的规模空前的大游行。在国民议会讨论戴高乐上台问题的时候，巴黎和其它城市的工人群众和各阶层人民又举行了示威游行。在这场斗争中，久经考验的法国共产党表现出它是和平、民主和自由的坚定的捍卫者，因而进一步提高了在法国人民中的威望。工人阶级的团结也进一步加强了。
    人心所向，在一定程度上对资产阶级政党内部也起了影响。很多党派在支持戴高乐问题上已经陷于严重的分裂。在社会党内，尽管摩勒之流可耻地为戴高乐奔走游说，结果在国民议会投票时还是有四十九个议员反对戴高乐上台，而支持戴高乐的只有四十二个议员。在激进社会党、民主社会抵抗联盟和人民共和党内，也有一部分议员在授权表决中投了反对票。
    戴高乐上台以后，马上就迫使国民议会通过三项法案，决定授予政府以特别权力，并且使得修改宪法可以绕过议会来进行。这是向民主进攻的开始。但是，法国的工人阶级和人民群众正团结在法国共产党的周围，随时准备对戴高乐所采取的反民主的措施进行反击。“法国人民反对所有的独裁政府！任何军事独裁政府都征服不了伟大的法国人民！”法国共产党领袖杜克洛所说的这些话，就是千千万万法国人民共同的意志和共同的决心。
    黎巴嫩人民在坚持战斗
    黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义及其代理人的武装起义，已经持续将近一个月了。在首都贝鲁特，起义人民一开头就占据了巴斯塔区。在黎巴嫩北部，起义人民控制了包括的黎波里旧城、哈勒巴、贾巴因等城市的整个地区。在中部的舒弗山区，德鲁斯部落人民的部队已经建立了根据地。南部的赛伊达、特尔·马贾荣等城市，有强大的起义人民部队在活动。南部沿海重要城市、阿美石油公司输油管的终点西顿的爱国人民，在5月25日，也展开了武装斗争。
    亲西方的夏蒙政府，对起义人民进行了血腥的镇压。政府军队出动了坦克和飞机进攻起义人民控制的城镇。美国及其仆从国家，从黎巴嫩人民起义的一开头，就对黎巴嫩进行粗暴干涉，援助黎巴嫩政府军队向人民进攻。5月18日，由美国军人驾驶的飞机竟轰炸了的黎波里。美国一千多名现役军官，穿着平民服装，直接指挥黎巴嫩的保安部队和陆军。前“阿拉伯军团”司令、目前担任巴格达条约集团高级顾问的英国将军格拉布，也到达贝鲁特，策划对起义人民进行军事进攻。此外，数以千计的伊拉克和约旦士兵，在美、英直接指挥下，最近也空运到贝鲁特，参加镇压黎巴嫩爱国人民的军事行动。但是，帝国主义及其代理人并没有达到他们的目的。英勇战斗的起义人民，不断地击退了政府军的进攻，仍然控制着黎巴嫩的大片地区。
    在仅有一百五十多万人口的黎巴嫩，发生了这样轰轰烈烈的反对帝国主义及其代理人的武装斗争，这是一个振奋人心的事件。这个事件表明，黎巴嫩人民的政治觉悟正在日益提高，他们深切地认识到，黎巴嫩的民族利益同“艾森豪威尔主义”是不可调和的，因此他们英勇地拿起武器，同执行帝国主义政策的夏蒙政府展开了坚决的斗争。这个事件也表明，帝国主义在中近东的威风越来越衰落，中近东人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的运动则势不可挡。同埃及人民抗击帝国主义侵略者和叙利亚人民粉碎帝国主义战争计划的斗争一样，黎巴嫩目前发生的事件，是对于帝国主义的又一次沉重打击。
    正是因为这样，美国对黎巴嫩局势的发展是不会甘心的。它正调兵遣将，企图利用已经破产的“艾森豪威尔主义”和其他借口，对黎巴嫩进一步“采取行动”。这种阴谋活动已经形成对和平的威胁。同时，美国也在极力进行政治阴谋，企图分化黎巴嫩的各反对党和广大人民，以保存它在黎巴嫩的侵略势力。在美国的指使下，黎巴嫩当局最近提出好几个所谓改组政府的计划，其目的都是为了让夏蒙继续担任总统。另外，也有人提出其他的计划，要求各反对党和起义人民向夏蒙妥协。但是，这些计划都遭到了主要反对党和广大人民的拒绝。各主要反对党和广大人民坚决要求夏蒙辞职。他们正为这个一致的目标而坚持斗争。
    黎巴嫩人民的斗争，也是保卫和平的斗争。美国及其追随者想在黎巴嫩玩火，这不能不引起爱好和平国家的严重注意。苏联人民已经表示，他们对帝国主义在中近东的新冒险计划不能置之不理。世界各国人民也都支持黎巴嫩人民的斗争。“得道者多助”，这是黎巴嫩人民争取胜利的一个十分有利的条件。
