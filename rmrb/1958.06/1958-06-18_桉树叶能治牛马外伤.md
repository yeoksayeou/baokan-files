    Eucalyptus Leaves Can Treat External Injuries in Cattle and Horses
    Comrade Xie Dianyin, a veterinarian in my detachment, has proven through extensive experimentation that eucalyptus leaves can treat external injuries and suppurating wounds in cattle and horses. Its effectiveness is no less than that of penicillin, sulfonamides, iodine tincture, iodoform, potassium permanganate, and other disinfectants that we usually use.
    Preparation method: Dry the eucalyptus leaves in the sun, use 20 cm each time, add 200 cc of water, decoct to 100 cc, filter with coarse gauze, and put it in a bottle, tightly sealed to prevent volatilization. After it is slightly warm, use cotton wool dipped in the liquid to apply to the wound. Wash the wound every four hours, and it will heal in one week to ten days.

    桉树叶能治牛马外伤
    我支队兽医谢锻英同志，经多方试验证明：桉树叶能治疗牛马外伤及化脓创伤。其功用不减于我们平素惯用的青霉素、?胺、碘酊、碘仿、鐹锰酸钾等消毒药品。
    配制方法：是将桉树叶晒干，每次用二十公分，加水二百公撮，煎至一百公撮，用粗纱布滤过，装入瓶内，严密封口，以防挥发。稍温后，用棉花蘸其液体涂于伤口处。每隔四小时洗涤一次，一周至十天即可痊愈。
