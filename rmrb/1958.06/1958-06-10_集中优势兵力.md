　　Concentrating superior forces to attack a single stronghold and achieve a complete victory in a campaign is a common method used by experienced military commanders in revolutionary warfare. Applying this method to the production front to direct the technological revolution is still relatively rare. The Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory's technical team concentrated its technical strength to conquer technological fortresses, which can be described as a creative approach in the process of technological revolution.
    
    Currently, the biggest problems in production enterprises can be summarized into two aspects: one is the issue of workers' labor concept, that is, who they are working for; the other is the issue of technical ideology and technical level. After rectification and study, the socialist labor concept has been further established, and technical issues have become prominent problems in our construction journey. Our technical strength is lacking. Many experienced veteran workers cannot improve rapidly because they lack the guidance of scientific and technological theory; some engineering and technical personnel with technical theoretical knowledge often detach themselves from production practice and apply outdated process regulations, affecting technological improvement. In addition, due to departmental divisions and specialized duties, product design is the responsibility of the design department, production technology is the responsibility of the technology department, and product production is the responsibility of the production workshop. As for whether the product design is feasible and the production technology is reasonable in production practice, they rarely care. Sometimes, when people from the production workshop come to them with technical problems, the technical personnel only flip through drawings and materials, talk about it theoretically, and may not solve the actual problem. In this situation, how can the technical level be rapidly improved, and how can key technical problems be quickly resolved?

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward in production requires all personnel engaged in production to be both red and expert, and all production tools and production technologies must create conditions and be continuously updated. The organizational form of enterprises must also be changed to adapt to the new situation. A certain organizational form represents certain work content. The Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory organized several technical teams according to different products, concentrated technical strength, and attacked technical fortresses. This is a bold attempt to advance technology and a major change in production relations. At present, the relationship between departments in this factory has changed, the relationship between departmental personnel and production workers has changed, and the relationship between the previous process and the next process has changed. This relationship is specifically manifested in the fact that under the leadership of the technical team, the goals are consistent, the understanding is consistent, and the steps are consistent. With this new type of organizational form and interrelationship, not only has the sense of responsibility of technical personnel been enhanced, and the shortcomings of departmental division and lack of correlation have been compensated, but more importantly, the excellent qualities of engineering and technical personnel have been cultivated in production practice, and technical experience has been enriched, thereby gradually creating a set of practical and compliant process systems that meet the requirements of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, enabling production technology to leap from one stage to another.

    It should be seen that it is not just the organizational form that determines the technological leap forward. To concentrate all the energy of technical personnel on one goal, we must not relax the daily political and ideological work. Only by firmly grasping this link can technical personnel see as greatly and as far as optical instruments.

    集中优势兵力，攻打一个据点，取得战役的全胜，这是有经验的军事指挥员在革命战争中常用的方法。把这种方法运用到生产战线上来，指挥技术革命，到现在还不多见。云南光学仪器厂的技术大队集中使用技术力量，攻下技术堡垒，可以说是技术革命进程中具有创造性的一种做法。
    当前生产企业中最大的问题，归纳起来不外两个，一个是职工的劳动观念问题，也就是为谁劳动问题；另一个就是技术思想和技术水平问题。经过整风学习，社会主义的劳动观念已经进一步确立起来，而技术问题就成为我们建设途程中突出的问题了。我们的技术力量是缺乏的，许多有经验的老工人，因为缺乏科学技术理论指导，不能迅速地提高；有些具有技术理论知识的工程技术人员，常常脱离生产实践，搬用陈旧的工艺规章，影响技术的改进。加之科室分工，各有专职，产品设计是设计科的事，生产工艺是工艺科的事，产品生产是生产车间的事，至于生产实践中，产品设计是否可行，生产工艺是否合理，他们就很少关心。有时，生产车间的人为了技术问题找到门上来了，技术人员才翻翻图纸资料，从理论上讲一套，也未必解决实际问题。试问这种情况，技术水平怎能迅速提高，技术关键问题又怎能很快解决呢？
    生产大跃进的形势，要求所有从事生产的人员必须又红又专，一切生产工具和生产技术要创造条件、不断更新。企业的组织形式也要适应新的形势有所改变。一定的组织形式代表着一定的工作内容。云南光学仪器厂按照不同的产品分别组织若干技术大队，集中使用技术力量，攻打技术堡垒，这是向技术进军的一个大胆尝试，也是生产关系的一大改变。目前，这个厂科室与科室之间的关系改变了，科室人员与生产工人的关系改变了，前一个工序与后一个工序的关系改变了。这种关系具体表现在在技术大队的统率下，目标一致、认识一致、步调一致。有了这种新型的组织形式和相互关系，不仅增强了技术人员的责任感，弥补了科室分工各不相关的缺陷，而且更重要的是在生产实践中锻炼了工程技术人员的优良品质，丰富了技术经验，从而逐步创造出一套切合实际、符合多快好省建设方针的工艺制度，使生产技术从一个飞跃到另一个飞跃。
    应当看到，决定技术跃进的不只是组织形式问题，要把技术人员的全部精力集中到一个目标上去，决不能放松日常的政治思想工作。只有紧紧抓住了这个环节，才能使技术人员像光学仪器一样，看得很大也看得很远。
