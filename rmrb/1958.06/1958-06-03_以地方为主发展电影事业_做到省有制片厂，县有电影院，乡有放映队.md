Xinhua News Agency, 2nd June – To implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction in the development of the film industry, and to gradually achieve a situation where each province has a film studio, each county has a cinema, and each commune has a film projection team within five to ten years, is the plan proposed by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture at the Film Industry Leap Forward Work Conference held in Beijing from May 25th to May 31st. Representatives from the cultural bureaus of twenty-seven provinces (cities) and autonomous regions, as well as heads of various film studios and film institutions, participated in this conference.

　　This conference analyzed the situation of the leap forward in the film industry and discussed plans for establishing film studios in various provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, and for establishing privately-run film projection teams. The conference believes that in order to make the film industry adapt to the development of socialist construction and the cultural life of the people, it is necessary to change the existing film industry system according to the spirit of the General Line, and under the conditions of centralized leadership, comprehensive planning, division of labor and cooperation, fully mobilize all positive factors. According to the principle of combining central and local initiatives, combining large, medium, and small-scale efforts, and combining cultural departments' management with self-management by business departments and mass organizations, and primarily relying on local initiatives to develop the film industry. According to this spirit, some film studios under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, with the exception of a few, will be transferred to the relevant provinces and cities, and the power of film distribution will also be decentralized. The plan for establishing film studios in various provinces and autonomous regions also stipulates that news film studios should be established in various provinces and autonomous regions this year. Guangdong, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang and other ten provinces and autonomous regions, in addition to Guangdong and Shaanxi continuing construction, the others will start preparing for the construction of comprehensive film studios this year and start their own production from next year. By 1961, all provinces and cities will have completed the construction of comprehensive film studios and put them into production. At present, the production of newsreels has blossomed everywhere. News film studios (stations) in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have already produced the first batch of news bulletins or short documentaries, some of which have already met with audiences.

　　According to the plan of this conference, various localities will also trial run more than 500 film projection teams run by agricultural cooperatives this year. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, cinemas will be established in 80%-90% of the counties across the country, and wide-screen cinemas will be appropriately developed in large cities in various provinces and cities as needed and possible.

　　This conference pointed out that in order to achieve the above plan, it is necessary to implement putting politics in command in film work. The film industry must actively serve socialist construction and workers, peasants and soldiers, promote the Party's General Line for socialist construction, overcome bourgeois ideas in film art creation, and proceed from the 600 million viewers to create films with a high degree of ideological content and that are welcomed by workers, peasants and soldiers, with distinctive local characteristics and national styles. It is necessary to break superstitions, oppose mystical views, break old systems that are not suitable for the development of the film industry, and give full play to the potential of film creators, film industrial personnel, film machinery and equipment, and the film machinery industry, as well as various aspects.

　　This conference also pointed out that the construction of film studios in various provinces and cities should implement the principle of simultaneous production and construction, self-reliance as the main factor, and strong support from old factories. In the construction of factories, attention should be paid to diligence and thrift, making use of available resources, and preventing the tendency of seeking perfection, large scale, novelty, extravagance and waste in capital construction and machinery and equipment. In film production, film studios in various provinces and cities should mainly face the local areas, and on the premise of further strengthening the socialist content of films, vigorously promote diverse styles, so that film production can truly achieve "a riot of color" and "let a hundred flowers bloom."

　　以地方为主发展电影事业
    做到省有制片厂，县有电影院，乡有放映队
    据新华社2日讯  在电影事业发展中贯彻党的社会主义建设的总路线，在五年到十年内，逐步做到各省有电影制片厂，各县有电影院，各乡有电影放映队，这是文化部电影事业管理局在5月25日到5月31日在北京举行的电影事业跃进工作会议上提出的规划。这个会议，有二十七个省（市）自治区文化局代表和各制片厂、各电影事业单位负责人参加。
    这次会议分析了电影事业跃进的形势，并且讨论了在各省、自治区、市建立电影制片厂和举办民办放映队等方案。会议认为，要使电影事业适应社会主义建设事业发展和人民文化生活的要求，就必须根据总路线的精神，改变现有电影事业的体制，在集中领导，全面规划，分工协作的条件下，充分调动一切积极因素，根据中央举办与地方举办相结合，大中小型相结合，文化部门举办和业务部门、群众组织自办相结合的原则，并以地方为主来发展电影事业。根据这个精神，文化部电影局所属的一些电影制片厂除个别外将下放到有关省市，电影放映发行的职权亦将下放。在各省、自治区建立电影制片厂的方案还规定，今年内就要在各省、自治区分别建立起新闻电影制片厂，广东、陕西、新疆、内蒙古、湖北、四川、安徽、浙江等十个省和自治区，除广东、陕西继续建设外，其他均从今年开始筹建综合性电影制片厂并将从明年开始自己生产，到1961年各省市将全部建成综合性制片厂并投入生产。目前，新闻影片的制作已经遍地开花，江苏、陕西、山东、广东、浙江、安徽、内蒙古自治区等地的新闻电影制片厂（站）已经拍摄出第一批新闻简报或短纪录片，其中有的已经同观众见了面。
    根据这次会议的规划，今年各地还将试办五百个以上的由农业合作社自办的电影放映队，在第二个五年计划期间将在全国80％—90％的县里建立起电影院，并根据需要和可能在各省市的大城市适当发展宽银幕电影院。
    这次会议指出，为了实现上述规划，必须在电影工作中实行政治挂帅，电影事业必须积极地为社会主义建设和工农兵服务，宣传党的社会主义建设的总路线，克服电影艺术创作中的资产阶级思想，要从六亿观众出发，创造有高度思想性的和为工农兵喜闻乐见的、具有鲜明的地方色彩和民族风格的影片。要破除迷信，反对神秘观点，打破旧的不适合于电影事业发展的制度，充分发挥电影创作人员、电影工业人员、电影机械设备和电影机械工业以及各方面的潜力。
    这次会议还指出，各省市建设电影制片厂应当贯彻边生产边建设，自力为主，老厂大力支援的方针，在建厂中要注意勤俭办事，因陋就简，防止在基本建设和机械设备等方面求全、求大、求新、铺张浪费的偏向。各省市的制片厂在制片中，主要应当面向地方，在进一步加强影片的社会主义内容的前提下，大力提倡多种多样的风格，使电影制片真正做到万紫千红、百花齐放。
