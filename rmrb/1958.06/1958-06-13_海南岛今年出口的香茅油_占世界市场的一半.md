    Hainan Island's Citronella Oil Exports Account for Half of the World Market This Year
    (Our dispatch) Hainan Island has become an important producing area of ​​spice oils in the world. This year, the organized exports of citronella oil will account for half of the world market. Citronella oil is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing spices, soaps, artificial menthol, mosquito repellent, bactericides, and hydrocinnamic vanillin.
    The capitalist countries that first manufactured citronella oil in the world have a history of sixty-eight years. Hainan Island started production in 1953. In less than five years, the quality has surpassed the main producing area of ​​Indonesia. At present, the citronella planting area in Hainan has increased more than 5,000 times compared with before liberation, and more than 30 processing plants have been established successively.
    Hainan produces many varieties of spice oils, including citronella oil, maple citronella oil, patchouli oil, spearmint oil, and lemon eucalyptus oil. This year, the introduction of vetiver, mint and litsea cubeba oil crops has also begun. The export value of these spice oils is very high. Four tons of patchouli oil can be exchanged for nineteen heavy-duty trucks. Thirteen countries, including Britain, France and India, purchase citronella oil from our country. (Zeng Shan)

    海南岛今年出口的香茅油
    占世界市场的一半
    本报讯　海南岛已成为世界香料油的重要产地。今年组织出口的香茅油将占世界市场的一半。香茅油是制造香料、肥皂、人造薄荷脑、驱蚊油、杀菌剂、氢基香草醛等不可少的原料。
    世界上制造香茅油最早的资本主义国家已有六十八年历史，海南岛是在1953年开始生产，在不到五年的时间内，质量已超过世界上的主要产区印度尼西亚。目前，海南的香茅种植面积已比解放前增加五千多倍，先后建立起来的加工厂有三十多间。
    海南出产的香料油品种很多，有香茅油、枫茅油、藿香油、留兰香油、柠檬安油。今年又开始引种香根、薄荷和山苍子等油料作物。这些香料油的出口价值都很高，四吨藿香油就可换十九部载重汽车。向我国购买香茅油的有英、法和印度等十三个国家。　（曾珊）
