Overseas Chinese affairs work should emphasize implementing the principle of "starting from the 600 million people, taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements." It should be good at analyzing what are the interests of all the people (including the interests of overseas Chinese), what are the interests of overseas Chinese; what are the long-term interests, what are the temporary interests; what is the mainstream, what is the tributary. Only in this way can we correctly handle various issues in overseas Chinese affairs work, solve the special problems of overseas Chinese and their relatives, and be promoters of socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, June 6th. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, domestic overseas Chinese affairs work should also strive for advancement and take the lead in the leap forward. This was proposed at the first enlarged meeting of the Second Committee of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which closed in Beijing on the 3rd.

The meeting was held in Beijing from May 24 to June 3. In accordance with the spirit of rectification, the meeting summarized the work of the first half of the year and arranged for future work.

At this meeting, He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Fang Fang, Vice Chairman, both spoke. In her speech, He Xiangning called on overseas Chinese affairs workers in various places to find ways to guide relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to exert their strength and role in the socialist construction of their hometowns. In the great leap forward of production, relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese should also actively participate in the upsurge of production and construction with the spirit of the great leap forward, and contribute all their strength to the construction of socialism.

In his report, Fang Fang said that through the universal and in-depth study of the general line of socialist construction, it should be clear that the plan for all the people is the plan for overseas Chinese affairs work. Overseas Chinese affairs work should strive to take the lead in any aspect that may leap forward and take the lead. For example, developing subtropical economic crops, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and sports activities for returned overseas Chinese students in overseas Chinese hometowns. He emphasized that overseas Chinese affairs work must also strive for advancement and be promoters. Any ideas such as "following the crowd and catching the train" are lagging behind the current situation. Overseas Chinese affairs workers should emphasize implementing the principle of "starting from the 600 million people, taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements." It should be good at analyzing what are the interests of all the people (including the interests of overseas Chinese), what are the interests of overseas Chinese; what are the long-term interests, what are the temporary interests; what is the mainstream, what is the tributary. Only in this way can we correctly handle various issues in overseas Chinese affairs work, solve the special problems of overseas Chinese and their relatives, and be promoters of socialist construction.

Fang Fang also talked about the issue of self-reliance at the meeting. He said that advocating that returned overseas Chinese and their relatives become self-reliant laborers is not only to completely abolish the remnants of exploitation among them, to transform people, but also to develop new socialist relations between people, and to combine mental and physical labor in the cultural revolution and technological revolution to promote the leap forward in production. At the same time, this is also the foundation for strengthening the unity of overseas Chinese relatives, returned overseas Chinese and the domestic people. However, it is reasonable for relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese who are old, infirm, and unable to work to live on savings and support from relatives. The state will still provide social relief to those who are old, infirm, unable to work, and have no source of income.

He said that arranging and organizing the labor force of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to participate in industrial and agricultural production according to the needs of social production development is the fundamental direction of domestic overseas Chinese affairs work on labor production throughout the entire socialist construction period, but it does not negate other necessary labor. For example, housework, work in organs and streets, various voluntary labor, various municipal construction, etc. As long as it is a family necessity or work called upon by the Party and the government, it can also be considered labor time and counted as participating in labor.

Regarding the issue of dual nationality of overseas Chinese, Fang Fang said that it should be properly resolved through negotiations between the two governments. He said that, according to the principle of personal voluntariness, we should support overseas Chinese who are willing to choose the nationality of their country of residence, and there should be no discrimination whatsoever. We should naturally also agree with those who are willing to retain Chinese nationality. For those who cannot reside in their place of residence and return to China, the state also welcomes them to work and produce together with the people of the whole country and participate in national construction in accordance with the principle of starting from the 600 million people, taking into account all aspects and making appropriate arrangements.

In group discussions and speeches at the meeting, the delegates unanimously expressed their agreement with the speeches of He Xiangning and Fang Fang, and cited many examples to illustrate that relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in various places are making a great leap forward together with the people of the whole country, actively participating in labor production, and investing to support the construction of their hometowns.

The representatives' speeches showed that more and more relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in Fujian Province are participating in labor production. In Jinjiang County, 120,000 relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese participated in production every day this spring, and more than 50,000 people who had no labor habits in the past also actively participated in labor. Relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in Fujian Province have also launched an upsurge of investing to support local industrial construction and run public welfare undertakings. Up to now, overseas Chinese and domestic relatives of overseas Chinese in the province have donated funds to establish more than 1,000 middle schools, primary schools, and other specialized schools. By early May, overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Jinjiang County had invested more than 3 million yuan to support local industrial and agricultural construction, creating the highest investment record in history. In the past two months, the amount of investment by overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Nan'an County was equal to the total investment in the past five years.

The ideology of returned overseas Chinese students has also undergone great changes. They are advancing together with domestic students, actively participating in agricultural production and various voluntary labor. Two thousand students from the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Students' Middle School Remedial School braved the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius last winter to participate in voluntary labor to build water conservancy projects in Qinghe Town in the suburbs of the city, and as a result, they completed the task three days ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota by 100%. More than 300 returned overseas Chinese students from this school who voluntarily requested to go to Yunnan to participate in agricultural production this spring are working very well. In the process of labor training and participation in work-study programs, many moving events have also emerged among returned overseas Chinese students in Guangdong and Fujian. From January to early May this year, 96 returned overseas Chinese students from eight middle schools in Guangzhou participated in agricultural production in the countryside.

The meeting also elected 30 overseas Chinese representatives to the Second National People's Congress.

During the preparatory meeting, the attendees participated in voluntary labor to build the Ming Tombs Reservoir.

### 侨务工作要从全局出发力争上游  侨委扩大会议根据整风精神安排今后工作

　　侨务工作要从全局出发力争上游
    侨委扩大会议根据整风精神安排今后工作
    侨务工作者应该着重贯彻“从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排”的原则，应善于分析什么是全民的利益（包括华侨利益），什么是华侨的利益；什么是长远利益，什么是暂时利益；什么事情是主流，什么事情是支流。只有这样才能正确地处理侨务工作中的各种问题，既解决了华侨、侨眷的特殊问题，又能做社会主义建设的促进派。
    据新华社6日讯　在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，国内侨务工作也应力争上游，跃进居先。这是3日在北京闭幕的华侨事务委员会第二届委员会第一次扩大会议提出的。
    会议从5月24日到6月3日在北京举行。会议根据整风的精神，总结了上半年的工作和安排了今后的工作。
    在这次会议上，华侨事务委员会主任何香凝、副主任方方都讲了话。何香凝在讲话中号召各地的侨务工作者应设法引导侨眷、归侨对家乡的社会主义建设事业，发挥他们的力量和作用。侨眷、归侨在生产大跃进中也应以大跃进的精神，积极投入生产建设的热潮，为建设社会主义而贡献一切力量。
    方方在报告中说，通过对社会主义建设总路线普遍深入的学习，应当明确以全民计划为侨务工作的计划。侨务工作凡是可能跃进居先的，应该力争跃进居先。例如，在侨乡发展亚热带经济作物、文教卫生事业、归国华侨学生的体育运动等。他强调指出，侨务工作也一定要力争上游，要做促进派，任何“随上大流、挂上列车”等想法都是落后于当前形势的。侨务工作者应该着重贯彻“从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排”的原则，应善于分析什么是全民的利益（包括华侨利益），什么是华侨的利益；什么是长远利益，什么是暂时利益；什么事情是主流，什么事情是支流。只有这样才能正确地处理侨务工作中的各种问题，既解决了华侨、侨眷的特殊问题，又能做社会主义建设的促进派。
    方方在会上还谈到了自食其力的问题，他说，提倡归侨、侨眷变为自食其力的劳动者，不仅是为了彻底废除他们中的剥削残余，为了改造人，而且也是为了发展人与人之间的社会主义新的关系，在文化革命、技术革命中，使脑力劳动与体力劳动结合，促进生产跃进。同时，这也是增强侨眷、归侨和国内人民团结的基础。但是，年老体衰，失去劳动力的侨眷、归侨，靠积蓄和亲人赡养为生是合理的。对年老体衰、失去劳动力没有生活来源的人，国家仍将进行社会救济。
    他说，根据社会生产发展的需要，安排、组织侨眷、归侨的劳动力，参加工、农业生产，这是整个社会主义建设时期国内侨务工作在劳动生产问题上的根本方向，但也并不否定其他的必要劳动。例如家务劳动、机关和街道工作、各种义务劳动、各项市政建设等等。只要是家庭必需或是党和政府号召要做的工作，也可以认为是劳动的时间，算作是参加了劳动。
    关于华侨双重国籍问题，方方说，理应经过两国政府谈判，妥善解决。他说，根据本人自愿的原则，对于愿意选择所在国国籍的华侨，我们应当加以赞助，而不应当有丝毫的歧视，对于愿意保留中国国籍的，我们自然也应加以赞同；对于在侨居地无法居留而回国的，国家也根据从六亿人民出发，统筹兼顾、适当安排的原则欢迎他们和全国人民一道劳动生产，参加国家建设。
    参加会议的代表在小组讨论和大会发言中，一致表示同意何香凝、方方的讲话，并列举了很多事例，说明各地侨眷、归侨正和全国人民一起大跃进，积极参加劳动生产，投资支援家乡建设。
    代表们的发言表明，福建省侨眷、归侨参加劳动生产的越来越多。晋江县侨眷、归侨在今春每天都有十二万人投入生产，过去没有劳动习惯的五万多人也积极参加了劳动。福建省侨眷、归侨还掀起了投资支持地方工业建设和举办公益事业的热潮。到目前为止，全省旅外华侨和国内侨眷、归侨捐资兴办中学、小学和其他专业学校已达一千多所。到5月上旬止，晋江县华侨、侨眷投资支援地方工农业建设的就已达三百多万元，创造了历年来投资的最高纪录。南安县两个月来，华侨、侨眷投资的数目即相等于五年来投资的总和。
    归国华侨学生的思想也起了很大变化，他们正在和国内学生一同跃进，踊跃参加农业生产和各种义务劳动。北京市归国华侨学生中等补习学校的二千名学生，去冬冒着零下二十度的严寒到市郊清河镇参加兴修水利的义务劳动，结果提前三天超额百分之百完成任务。今春自动要求到云南参加农业生产的这个学校三百多名归侨学生，劳动得很好。广东、福建的归国华侨学生在劳动锻炼的过程中和参加勤工俭学活动中，也出现了许多动人的事例。从今年1月到5月初，广州市八所中学有九十六名归国华侨学生下乡参加农业生产。
    这次会议还选举了三十名第二届全国人民代表大会华侨代表。
    在预备会议期间，出席会议的人员曾参加了建设十三陵水库的义务劳动。
