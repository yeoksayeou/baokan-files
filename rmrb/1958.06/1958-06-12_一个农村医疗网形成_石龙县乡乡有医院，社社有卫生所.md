Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 11th -- In Shiling County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, farmers in 34 townships have established 40 hospitals on their own, equipped with 250 simple beds and maternity beds. In addition, 135 health centers and stations have been set up in various agricultural cooperatives. The county has achieved the goal of having hospitals in every township and basically health centers in every cooperative, forming a rural medical and prevention network.

These people-run hospitals were expanded or separated and built from the original joint clinics and their branch clinics. The health centers were reorganized and rebuilt or newly built from the original health rooms of the agricultural cooperatives. The medical equipment was based on the original equipment of the joint clinics, with the insufficient part supplemented by investment from the agricultural cooperatives and health care fees paid by the members. If there were not enough beds or no wards, they made do with whatever was available, using empty houses of the masses or building new or supplementing existing ones with labor and materials contributed by the masses. For example, when the masses in Tongwan Township heard that a hospital was to be built, each agricultural cooperative donated a bed, and after arranging them, a hospital was built.

In addition to the doctors from the original joint clinics and the health workers and midwives from the agricultural cooperatives, the source of medical personnel included more than 300 people, including private practitioners of Chinese and Western medicine mobilized by the county, demobilized medical personnel returning to their hometowns, and some rural health workers who had been trained in the past.

    一个农村医疗网形成
    石龙县乡乡有医院，社社有卫生所
    新华社南宁11日电　广西僮族自治区石龙县三十四个乡农民自办了四十所医院，设有简易病床、产床二百五十张；另外还在各农业社里设立了一百三十五个卫生所、卫生站。全县已经实现了乡乡有医院，基本上社社有卫生所，形成了一个农村医疗预防网。
    这些民办医院，都是由原有的联合诊所及其分诊所扩充或分开建成的。卫生所是从原来农业社的卫生室整顿改建和新建而成的。医药器材设备，是以联合诊所原有的器材设备为基础，不足部分由农业社投资和社员交保健费来补充。病床不够或没有病房，就因陋就简，利用群众的空房子或由群众献工献料新建、补建。如通挽乡的群众听说要办医院，每个农业社就献出一张床，整理后，一所医院就建成了。
    医务人员的来源，除了原有联合诊所的医生及农业社的保健员、接生员以外，县里还动员了私人开业的中医、西医、复员回乡的部队医务人员和过去训练的一部分农村卫生员共三百多人参加工作。
