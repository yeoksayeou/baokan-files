Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The "Wenyi Bao" ("Literary Gazette"), "Renmin Wenxue" ("People's Literature"), "Shikan" ("Poetry"), "Xin Guancha" ("New Observer") and other national literary periodicals, since the Great Leap Forward, have been striving to face the reality of life and open their doors to the masses. This approach has brought unprecedented vitality and fighting power to the publications.

    In recent times, these periodicals have focused on the issues of greatest concern to the masses, vigorously organizing the publication of works that rapidly reflect reality. "Renmin Wenxue" began with literary works that swiftly reflected major events at home and abroad, such as "Oh, the American Little Moon!" and "Yanghe Canal." Now, most of its works focus on the Great Leap Forward. The short stories in the sixth issue, such as "A Warm Snowy Night," "The Loading Record," and "Night Visit," quickly depict the Great Leap Forward scenes of rural areas becoming mechanized, building reservoirs, and constructing pumping stations. "Xin Guancha" has added many new columns this year, such as "Leap Forward Vanguard," "People Going Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside," and "From the Forefront of National Construction," which reflect the new atmosphere and new things in the Great Leap Forward from various aspects. "Shikan" also selected and published a large number of folk songs and poems reflecting the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. The bi-monthly "Harvest" recently published many works by writers who have been sent down to the countryside, using essays, features, and other literary forms to describe how they have been educated and inspired after immersing themselves in life. "Wenyi Bao" is making every effort to promote the spirit of literary creation linking with reality and the masses. The latest issue specifically sent editors to Shanxi Province to edit a "Shanxi Literary Special Edition" on the spot, introducing the mass character, realism, and national style of literary creation in Shanxi.

    These publications have recently attached great importance to publishing and recommending works by the masses, thus opening up a broad field of creation and winning the support and love of the broad masses. "Renmin Wenxue" published many feature articles and novels created by workers, such as "Waves of Shanghai" and "What Master Bu Gao Thought." The editors of the magazine also often go deep into factories to guide workers who love literature in their creations, discovering and cultivating talented literary authors from them. The one hundred worker poems published in the April issue of "Shikan" were praised by many writers, and also made readers pleasantly surprised to see the vigorous vitality of mass creation. The "Worker's Page" column newly opened by "Xin Guancha," organizing workers to write, draw, and edit themselves, aroused great interest among the masses. Recently, the "Worker's Page" independently edited by workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant published large-scale cartoons and poems such as "Singing High and Advancing Vigorously." The editors of the magazine believe that these works are completely comparable to those of experts.

    "Wenyi Bao," "Renmin Wenxue" and other periodicals have shown increasingly stronger political character and militancy. Through the re-criticism of poisonous weeds such as rightist Ding Ling, the criticism of the traitor Fast, and the criticism of Qin Zhaoyang's revisionist thought, the sharp struggle between the two roads on the literary front has been profoundly revealed, and readers' political sense and Marxist-Leninist ideological level have been improved. At the same time, the periodicals pay attention to strengthening regular literary criticism, and begin to implement the mass line in this work, combining expert reviews with mass reviews. "Wenyi Bao" opened a "Reader Discussion Forum." "Shikan" has a "Readers Talk About Poetry" column. "Renmin Wenxue" has also restored the "Reader Forum," which had been interrupted for two years. The inexhaustible source of mass literary criticism not only provides a rich ideological basis for expert commentary, but also, as can be seen from some recently published mass review articles, some unique insights have surpassed those of some experts. The April issue of "Shikan" published the incisive opinions of more than 30 workers on poetry creation. Some famous writers believe that some of these arguments are difficult for experts to put forward.

    The results of literary periodicals linking with reality, facing the masses, and enhancing combat effectiveness have also promoted changes in writing style. In these few periodicals, the themes and forms have recently become more diversified, and short, concise, popular, and lively articles have gradually increased.

    The new appearance of national literary periodicals is a good start to the soaring development of my country's socialist literary cause, and will play a promoting role in establishing a new writing style in my country's socialist era.

    社会主义文学事业飞跃发展
    “文艺报”等文学期刊向群众敞开大门
    据新华社18日讯　“文艺报”、“人民文学”、“诗刊”、“新观察”等几个全国性文学期刊，大跃进以来努力面向生活实际，向群众打开大门。这种做法给刊物带来了前所未有的生命力和战斗力。
    这些刊物最近一个时期都注意抓当前群众最关心的事，大力组织迅速反映现实的作品。“人民文学”从最早出现“哎呀呀！美国小月亮”、“洋河大渠”等迅速反映国内外大事的文学作品以来，现在大部分作品都以大跃进为内容。第六期刊载的短篇小说“一个温暖的雪夜”、“装车记”、“夜访”等，把农村车子化，修水库、修抽水站等大跃进景象迅速表现出来。“新观察”今年新增加的许多栏目“跃进尖兵”、“上山下乡的人”、“来自祖国建设前线”等，从各个方面反映大跃进中的新气象、新事物。“诗刊”也选登了大量反映工农业大跃进的民歌和诗作。“收获”双月刊，最近及时登载了许多下放作家，用散文、特写等文学形式描写自己深入生活后受到教育与感染的作品。“文艺报”更极力发扬文学创作联系实际、联系群众的精神，最近一期，特地派编辑人员到山西省就地编辑“山西文艺特辑”，介绍了山西文艺创作的群众性、现实性和民族风格。
    这些刊物最近都十分重视登载和推荐群众作品，因而开辟了广阔的创作领域，得到广大群众的拥护和喜爱。“人民文学”登载了“上海的浪花”、“步高师傅所想到的”等许多工人创作的特写、小说，刊物的编辑人员还经常深入工厂，辅导爱好文艺的工人进行创作，从中发现和培养有才能的文艺作者。“诗刊”4月号集中发表的一百首工人诗作受到许多作家的推崇，也使读者惊喜地看到群众创作蓬勃的生命力。“新观察”新辟的“工人之页”专栏，组织工人自写自画自编，引起群众极大的兴趣。最近由石景山钢铁厂工人自编的一期“工人之页”，刊登了“高歌猛进”的大幅漫画、诗歌，刊物编辑人员认为这些作品完全可以和专家的作品媲美。
    “文艺报”、“人民文学”等期刊已表现出愈来愈强的政治性和战斗性。通过对右派分子丁玲等毒草的再批判、对叛徒法斯特的批判及关于秦兆阳修正主义思想的批判，深刻地揭示了文艺战线两条道路的尖锐斗争，提高了读者的政治嗅觉和马列主义思想水平。各期刊同时注意加强经常性的文艺批评，在这一工作中开始贯彻群众路线，使专家评论与群众评论相结合。“文艺报”开辟了“读者讨论会”。“诗刊”有“读者谈诗”专栏。“人民文学”也恢复了曾中断两年的“读者论坛”。群众文艺批评的无尽源泉，不但为专家评论提供了丰富的思想基础，而且从最近发表的一些群众评论文章可以看到，有些独到之见已经超越某些专家的见解。“诗刊”4月号发表了三十多位工人对诗歌创作的精辟意见，一些著名文学家认为其中某些论点是专家很难提得出来的。
    文学期刊联系实际、面向群众、增强战斗性的结果，也促进了文风的改变。这几个刊物最近题材、形式更加多样化，短小精悍、通俗生动的文章日渐多了起来。
    全国性文学期刊开始出现的新面貌，是我国社会主义文学事业飞跃发展的一个良好开端，对树立我国社会主义时代新的文风将会起着促进的作用。
