Singing the General Line

    Thoughts grow wings, flying high and far:
    Shed the feeling of inferiority, dare to think and dare to do.
    Effort plus diligence, break through two barriers:
    Culture and technology, we must control!

    Thoughts grow wings, flying high and far:
    Create what we don't have, realize what is difficult.
    Don't underestimate the farmers, they can generate electricity with water;
    Don't underestimate those with little schooling, they can master machines.

    Thoughts grow wings, flying high and far:
    We must manage atomic energy, we must build big rockets,
    And also launch satellites, flying up to the ninth heaven.
    Everyone becomes an expert, every field produces top talents.

    思想长翅膀
    张永枚
    思想长翅膀，飞得高又远：
    甩掉自卑感，敢想更敢干。
    干劲加钻劲，打开两道关：
    文化和技术，我们要掌管！
    思想长翅膀，飞得高又远：
    没有的要创造，困难的要实现。
    别看庄稼人，能叫水发电；
    别看读书少，机器玩个转。
    思想长翅膀，飞得高又远：
    要管原子能，要造大火箭，
    还要放卫星，飞上九重天。
    人人成专家，行行出状元。
