Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th - According to TASS, a memorandum from the Soviet government to the U.S. government regarding the "Experts Conference" states that the Soviet government still believes that the Experts Conference should promote the cessation of such tests as quickly as possible by all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons. This memorandum was delivered to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson on the 24th by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

The Soviet government's memorandum is a response to the U.S. government's memorandum of June 20 regarding the convening of the Experts Conference. Both memorandums were published in Moscow newspapers on the 25th.

The Soviet government's memorandum points out that both sides have agreed on holding the Experts Conference in Geneva on July 1 and the duration of the conference. The Soviet side has expressed its agreement to the participation of British and French representatives in addition to the U.S. representatives. It also has no objection to the participation of a Canadian representative.

In consultation and agreement with the Polish government and the Czechoslovak government, the Soviet government's memorandum presents the list of experts designated by these two countries to participate in the Geneva conference.

The Soviet government refutes the claim in the U.S. government's memorandum of June 20 that the Soviet Union has deviated from the agreement reached on the issue of conference members. The Soviet government's memorandum states that the Soviet government has consistently adhered to the position elucidated in the letters from Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev to U.S. President Eisenhower on May 9 and 30 of this year.

    苏联向美国政府致送备忘录
    “专家会议”应促成停试氢弹
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府就举行“专家会议”问题给美国政府的一份备忘录说，苏联政府仍然认为，专家会议应当促进一切拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家尽快停止这种试验。这份备忘录已经在24日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给美国驻苏联大使汤普森。
    苏联政府的备忘录是答复美国政府6月20日关于召开专家会议问题的备忘录的。这两份备忘录都登载在25日的莫斯科报纸上。
    苏联政府的备忘录指出，关于7月1日在日内瓦召开专家会议以及这次会议的开会期限双方都已议妥。苏联方面表示同意除美国代表外，英国和法国的代表也参加会议。同样也不反对加拿大代表参加。
    在同波兰政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府协商同意下，苏联政府的备忘录提出了这两个国家指派参加日内瓦会议的专家名单。
    苏联政府驳斥了美国政府6月20日备忘录中所谓苏联离开了在会议成员问题上所达成的协议的说法。苏联政府的备忘录说，苏联政府始终一贯地坚守苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今年5月9日和30日给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信件中所阐明的立场。
