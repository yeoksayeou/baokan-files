Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 28th. After a large number of nurseries, sewing groups, and milling workshops were established, 3.2 million women laborers in rural Liaoning Province were generally liberated from household labor and invested in the intense summer hoeing production campaign.

This year, Liaoning Province's spring plowing and sowing progressed rapidly and in a concentrated time frame. Seedlings emerged uniformly and grew quickly. The cultivated area of paddy fields increased after the reform of the cultivation system, and with the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, there was a general feeling of insufficient rural labor. Mobilizing women's labor to participate in agricultural production became an extremely important issue.

When mobilizing women to participate in summer hoeing production, Party and government organizations at all levels conducted ideological education for them on the relationship between guaranteeing the realization of agricultural production increase targets and women's own interests; criticized the conservative thinking of some cadres who disliked "mobilizing women as troublesome, difficult, and of little use"; and earnestly helped women solve specific difficulties in participating in production, universally establishing nursery groups, sewing groups, rice milling groups, etc., to liberate women from household labor. According to incomplete statistics, at present, each agricultural cooperative in the province has an average of nearly five nurseries, more than twenty kindergartens, and nursery groups. Chaoyang County alone has established more than 500 sewing factories and sewing groups, and more than 1,600 grain processing factories and milling workshops. After the large-scale establishment of nurseries, sewing groups, and milling workshops in Xidayingzi Township, the number of women participating in field production increased from 70% during the spring plowing period to more than 90%.

This year's summer hoeing in Liaoning Province involves complex production projects and requires relatively strong technical skills. At the beginning of the summer hoeing season, various localities paid attention to organizing women to learn agricultural technology, and established many technical groups and technical night schools. Some women bought agricultural technology textbooks, while others took experienced farmers as teachers. Ten counties, including Fengcheng, Gaiping, Lingyuan, and Jianping, have trained more than 84,000 female technicians and skilled workers. In agricultural cooperatives in Chaoyang County, there are an average of three female technicians in each production team. Tens of thousands of women not only hoe the fields like men, but also undertake labor such as topdressing, checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, and rice transplanting. The number of women participating in hoeing in Beizhen County this year has increased fivefold compared with last year, and seventy women have learned how to plow.

After the broad masses of women's labor force participated in summer hoeing production, it not only greatly alleviated the tense situation of rural labor and improved the quality of field operations, but also enabled the province to complete the first hoeing task fifteen days ahead of schedule. In Lianhe Township, Chaoyang County, 80% of the first and second hoeing tasks in the large fields were completed by women, and the quality of the work was very good, which was praised by the male members of the cooperative.

    辽宁农村大办托儿所、缝纫组、碾磨坊
    妇女劳动力获得解放投入生产
    新华社沈阳28日电　辽宁省农村的三百二十万名妇女劳动力，在大量兴办托儿所、缝纫组、碾磨坊后，普遍从家务劳动中解放出来，投入了紧张的夏锄生产运动。
    今年，辽宁省的春耕播种进度快，时间集中，小苗齐出齐长，改革耕作制度后水田面积增加，加上大量兴修水利，农村劳动力普遍感到不足。发动妇女劳动力参加农业生产就成为一个极为重要的问题。
    各地党政组织在发动妇女参加夏锄生产的时候，对她们进行了保证实现农业增产指标同妇女切身利益的关系的思想教育；批判了某些干部嫌“发动妇女麻烦、困难多、作用小”的保守思想；认真帮助妇女解决参加生产的具体困难，普遍地建立起托儿组、缝纫组、碾米组等，使妇女们从家务劳动中解放出来。据不完全统计，目前全省平均每个农业社已有近五个托儿所、二十多个幼儿园和托儿小组。朝阳一个县就成立了五百多个缝纫厂和缝纫小组，建立了一千六百多个粮米加工厂和碾磨坊。西大营子乡在大量举办托儿所、缝纫组、碾磨坊以后，参加田间生产的妇女已由春耕时期的70％增加到90％以上。
    辽宁省今年夏锄中，生产项目复杂，技术性比较强，各地在夏锄开始时，就注意组织妇女学习农业技术，成立了许多技术小组、技术夜校。妇女们有的买了农业技术课本，有的拜老农为师。凤城、盖平、凌源、建平等十个县共培养和训练了八万四千多名女技术员和技术手。朝阳县的农业社中，平均每个生产队都有三名女技术员。成千上万的妇女不仅同男人一样铲地，而且还担负了追肥、查苗、补苗、水稻插秧等劳动。北镇县今年参加铲地的妇女比去年增加五倍，并且有七十名妇女学会了扶犁。
    广大妇女劳动力参加夏锄生产以后，不仅大大缓和了农村劳动力紧张的状况，提高了田间作业的质量，并且使全省提前十五天完成了头遍的铲趟任务。朝阳县联合乡80％大田的第一二遍铲趟任务，都是由妇女完成的，作业质量很好，受到男社员的称赞。
