Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th. More than 544 agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province have successively established agricultural science experiment teams, technology research groups, and technology research offices. A mass agricultural scientific research effort is unfolding vividly throughout the province.

The members of these agricultural cooperative science research organizations include both young and middle-aged farmers, as well as older farmers. The research work includes conducting comparative studies of various improved varieties of crops in light of local conditions, the introduction of high-yield crops, high-yield and bumper harvests, cultivation techniques, close planting, rational fertilization, soil improvement, irrigation, pest and disease control, and forestry, animal husbandry, horticulture, etc. The projects number more than 3,000. These scientific research activities have broken the shackles of various conservative ideas, promoted and adopted advanced scientific technologies and effective measures to increase production, achieving the goal of "people increasing knowledge and land increasing production."

In Yancheng County, 97 agricultural cooperatives established experiment teams last year, focusing on conducting experiments on improved varieties and high-yield cultivation of crops such as wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes. As a result, grain crops increased by more than 30%. Among them, four experiment teams achieved an average grain yield of over 500 jin per mu, and two teams exceeded 800 jin, creating a new record for large-scale high-yield grain crop production in the county. The science and technology research offices and laboratories established by 20 agricultural cooperatives, including Guangwu in Xingyang County, widely used simple scientific instruments to measure the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other elements in soil, moisture, and fertilizers, guiding commune members in accumulating fertilizer and rationally irrigating and fertilizing in stages, which not only increased yields but also cultivated a large number of technicians for the agricultural cooperatives.

In order to encourage and organize the masses to further develop agricultural scientific research in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, the Henan Provincial Agricultural Science Research Department recently convened a representative meeting of agricultural science experiment and research workers. The meeting summarized and promoted the successful experiences of past experiments and research in various regions, criticized certain scientific and technical personnel for mystifying science, only wanting to conduct experiments in research institutions, not trusting the masses, and being unwilling to go to agricultural cooperatives to assist farmers in conducting experiments, etc. These are bourgeois ideas, and based on the new situation of the current mass agricultural science great leap forward in Henan and the successful experiences in various regions, a work plan was formulated.

　　河南广大农民研究农业科学
    五百多个农业社建立研究组织
    据新华社郑州5日电　河南省有五百四十四个农业社已经先后建立了农业科学试验队、技术研究小组和技术研究室，一个群众性的农业科学研究工作正在全省有声有色地展开。
    这些农业社科学研究组织里的成员，有青壮年农民，也有老年农民。研究工作包括因地制宜地进行各种农作物优良品种对比、高产作物引种、高额丰产、栽培技术、密植、合理施肥、土壤改良、灌溉、病虫害防治和林业、畜牧、园艺等，项目达三千种以上。这些科学研究活动，打破了各种保守思想的束缚，推广和采用了先进科学技术和行之有效的增产措施，达到了“人增知识地增产”的目的。
    郾城县有九十七个农业社去年建立的试验队，着重进行小麦、玉米、红薯等作物的优良品种和高额丰产试验，结果粮食作物都增产30％以上，其中有四个试验队平均粮食亩产超过五百斤，有两个队超过八百斤，创造了全县粮食作物大面积丰产的新纪录。荥阳县广武等二十个农业社建立的科学技术研究室和化验室，广泛使用简单的科学仪器，测定土壤、墒情和肥料中的氮、磷、钾等元素的含量，指导社员积肥和合理分期灌溉、施肥，既增加了产量，又为农业社培养出大批技术员。
    河南省农业科学研究部门，为了鼓舞和组织群众多快好省地进一步开展农业科学研究，最近召开了农业科学试验研究工作者代表会议。会议总结与推广了过去各地试验研究的成功经验，批判了某些科学技术人员把科学神秘化，只愿意在研究机关作试验，不相信群众，不愿意到农业社协助农民作试验等资产阶级思想，并且根据当前河南群众性的农业科学大跃进的新形势和各地的成功经验，制定了工作规划。
