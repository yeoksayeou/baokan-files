Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, at its recent First Second Party Congress, proposed to save more than 10 million yuan for the country this year, and strive for grain self-sufficiency within three to five years.

For several months, the officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region, under the guidance of the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building the army, have formed a new situation of a great leap forward, with everyone finding tricks, tapping potential, and offering suggestions. This year, a certain automobile regiment will save the country wealth up to 5 million yuan. The Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory of the Military Region has doubled the number of vehicles repaired each month compared to the past, and is now advancing towards the goal of assembling four vehicles with scrap materials before National Day. The first "Leap Forward Brand" sedan has recently left the factory.

Under the slogan of "self-sufficiency in production," various units are continuously improving the targets for producing grain and vegetables. Recently, a certain automobile regiment used holidays and rest time to reclaim more than 200 mu of wasteland and newly build and renovate 2,000 meters of canals. The garrison in Xigaze decided to build a canal that can irrigate 300,000 mu of cultivated land. The officers and soldiers also plan to plant vegetables in the harsh winter of the plateau, changing the view that vegetables cannot grow in the winter on the plateau.

    贯彻多快好省勤俭建军方针
    西藏军区争取粮食自给
    据新华社拉萨电　中国人民解放军西藏军区，在最近召开的第一届第二次党代表大会上，提出今年为国家节约资金一千万元以上，三、五年内争取粮食自给。
    几个月来，西藏军区的官兵在贯彻多快好省勤俭建军的方针下，形成了一个人人找窍门、挖潜力、献计策的大跃进的新局面。汽车某团今年为国家节约的财富，将达五百万元。军区拉萨汽车修配厂，每月修车的台数比过去增加了一倍，现在正在向国庆节前用废旧料装配四辆汽车的目标前进。第一辆“跃进牌”大轿车已在最近出厂。
    “在生产自给”的口号下，各部队在不断提高生产粮食和蔬菜的指标。汽车某团最近利用假日和休息时间，开荒二百多亩，新修和整修水渠两千多公尺。日喀则驻军决定修建一条能灌溉三十万亩耕地的水渠。官兵们还计划在高原的严冬栽种蔬菜，改变人们认为高原冬季不能生长蔬菜的看法。
