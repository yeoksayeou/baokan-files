    Lu Cai and the "Lu Cai Hao" Rice

    "Lu Cai Hao" is an excellent early-maturing and high-yielding early indica rice variety currently being promoted comprehensively in Fujian Province. It is resistant to fertilizer, drought, and waterlogging, and can resist pests and diseases and withstand cold, and is not prone to lodging. It originated in Xianyou and was cultivated by Lu Cai (provincial model worker), a member of the Shanwei Agricultural Cooperative in Wangdun Township, Xianyou County, from a single ear of rice that mutated in the "Nante Hao" early rice variety.

    Lu Cai is sixty-two years old this year. He has been farming since he was a child, likes to study farming techniques, and is very serious about seed selection. In 1948, Lu Cai found a rice seedling growing particularly well on the edge of his three-fen "Nante Hao" paddy field. This seedling was somewhat different from "Nante Hao." The plant was two or three inches shorter, the stem was thick, the leaves were large, and the base was a deeper purplish-red. At the time, he kept the seedling and let it continue to grow. When it headed, the rice seedling had a total of six ears, with more than one hundred and fifty grains per ear, and the grains were round and large. At the summer harvest, he harvested the six ears separately, obtaining a total of more than eight hundred and ninety seeds. After drying, he wrapped them in cloth and stored them in a jar. He cultivated them every year and expanded the planting area every year. By the spring of 1952, "Lu Cai Hao" was planted on thirty mu in the Lu Dexiu mutual aid team in which Lu Cai participated. In the spring of 1956, the area of "Lu Cai Hao" in the county had expanded to more than 12,000 mu, and it was introduced to Jinjiang, Yongchun, Dehua, Nan'an, Huian, Tong'an and other counties for trial planting. The results were greatly increased yields, and it was named "New Nante Hao." In order to encourage the selection of new varieties, the Jinjiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office decided to rename "New Nante Hao" as "Lu Cai Hao." Last spring, in addition to expanding the planting of "Lu Cai Hao" in various counties of the Jinjiang area, trial planting was also carried out throughout the province. This year, "Lu Cai Hao" has been promoted throughout the province, with a planting area of approximately 150,000 mu.

    陆财和“陆财号”水稻
    “陆财号”是福建省目前正在全面推广的一个早熟丰产的早籼稻优良品种。它耐肥、耐旱、耐涝，能抗病虫害和御寒，不易倒伏。它原产在仙游，是仙游县王墩乡山尾农业社社员陆财（省劳模），从早稻良种“南特号”田中选择变异的单穗培育出来的。
    陆财今年六十二岁，他从小就种田，喜欢钻研耕作技术，对选种工作很认真。1948年陆财在他的一块三分大的“南特号”秧田的埂边，发现一株长得特别好的秧苗。这株秧苗和“南特号”有些不同，植株矮二、三寸，茎秆粗壮，叶片阔大，基部紫红色较深，当时他就把这株秧苗留下来，让它继续生长。到抽穗时，这株稻苗共抽了六个穗，每穗有一百五十多粒，谷粒圆大。夏收时，他单独收获了这六个穗，共得种子八百九十多粒，晒干后，用布包好，藏在缸中。以后年年培育，年年扩大播种面积，到1952年春，“陆财号”就在陆财自己参加的陆得秀互助组种了三十亩。1956年春，全县“陆财号”面积已扩大到一万二千多亩，并引进晋江、永春、德化、南安、惠安、同安等县试种，结果都大大增产，并定名为“新南特号”。晋江专署为了鼓励新品种的选育工作，决定将“新型南特号”改为“陆财号”。去年春，“陆财号”除在晋江专区各县扩大种植外，并在全省各地进行试种，今年“陆财号”已在全省各地推广，种植面积约有十五万亩。
