    Industrial Important Elements - Rare Metals
    Wang Hong
    Rare metals are an extremely important component of modern industry. For example, lithium, zirconium, tantalum, niobium, cadmium, lanthanum, hafnium, samarium, etc., are necessary materials for the atomic industry; tantalum, niobium, zirconium, rhenium, cesium, rubidium, strontium, thallium, cadmium, germanium, indium, etc., are materials for the radio and electronics industry; all rare refractory metals and certain rare earth metals are the main raw materials for constructing various high-grade alloy steels that are heat-resistant, corrosion-resistant, and stainless. In particular, titanium alloys and cobalt alloys are indispensable materials for manufacturing jet aircraft and missiles. The organic chemical industry and silicate industry also need certain refractory metals as contact agents and catalysts. Therefore, rare metals are indispensable in the metallurgical industry, machinery manufacturing, atomic industry, electronics industry, and defense industry. Without rare metals, there would be no modern industry. At present, the industrial competition between countries internationally is mainly manifested as competition for rare metals. Whoever can produce more rare metals, whoever can discover and master the properties of rare metals more, and whoever can achieve high purification of rare metals can produce various high-quality alloys and alloy steels, and will have a high-level mechanical industry and modernized atomic, electronics, and defense industries. Therefore, the rare metal industry represents a country's level of industrialization and scientific and technological level.
    What are rare metals? This must be discussed starting from the classification of metals. To date, a total of sixty-seven metallic elements have been discovered to be stored in nature. Among them, except for iron, manganese, and chromium, which are called ferrous metals, the remaining sixty-four are called non-ferrous metals.
    According to the abundance of reserves in nature, non-ferrous metals are divided into two parts: one part is called ordinary metals; the other part is called rare metals. There are thirteen kinds of ordinary metals, and their names are: copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, magnesium, tin, antimony, nickel, sodium, calcium, potassium, barium, and strontium. In addition, there are fifty-one kinds called rare metals. These fifty-one rare metals can be roughly classified into six categories according to their properties and characteristics:
    The first category is called rare light metals. Their characteristics are low specific gravity and light weight. This category includes four metals: lithium, beryllium, rubidium, and cesium.
    The second category is called rare refractory metals. Their characteristic is a high melting point. This category includes ten metals: titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, and cobalt.
    The third category is called rare dispersed metals. Their characteristic is that the ore bodies are dispersed and always associated with other minerals. This category includes four metals: gallium, indium, thallium, and germanium.
    The fourth category is called radioactive metals. They have natural radioactivity. This category includes six metals: uranium, polonium, thorium, radium, actinium, and protactinium.
    The fifth category is called rare earth metals. Their natural oxides resemble soil. This category includes sixteen metals, and their names are: cerium, praseodymium, lanthanum, yttrium, scandium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium.
    The sixth category is called precious metals, totaling eleven, and their names are: gold, silver, platinum, iridium, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, cadmium, bismuth, and mercury.
    Rare metals are not only extremely rare in the earth's crust, but also the ore bodies are very dispersed, and refining and purification are very difficult. Therefore, small reserves, difficult exploration, difficult refining, and difficult purification are the characteristics of rare metals. Without a high level of science and technology, it would be impossible to discover it, and even if it is discovered, it cannot be refined. Therefore, the emergence of most rare metals has been after the nineteenth century, and it has taken nearly a hundred years from discovery to formal production.
    Our country is a country with extremely abundant reserves of rare metals. Judging from very incomplete data alone, most provinces in the country have rich mineral deposits, and the ore bodies are quite concentrated, often reaching tens of millions of tons in one mine. Therefore, it is very likely that the term "rare metal" is not applicable in our country.
    However, abundant reserves are one thing, clear exploration and mining are another; smelting and purification are yet another. At present, we are relatively backward in the production of rare metals, and we must catch up in the short term! The development speed of the rare metal industry will mark the speed of our country's industrialization.

    工业重要元素——稀有金属
    王虹
    稀有金属是近代工业中极其重要的组成部分。比如说，锂、锆、钽、铌、镉、镧、铪、钐等是原子工业的必要材料；钽、铌、锆、铼、铯、铷、锶、铊、镉、锗、铟等是无线电和电子工业的材料；全部稀有难熔金属及某些稀土金属，是构成各种耐热、防蚀、不锈等高级合金钢的主要原料，特别是钛的合金与钴的合金，是制造喷气飞机和导弹的不可缺少的材料；有机化学工业和矽酸盐工业也需要某些难熔金属作接触剂和催化剂等，所以无论在冶金工业、机器制造业、原子工业、电子工业、国防工业中都离不了稀有金属，没有稀有金属就没有近代工业。目前国际上各国的工业竞赛，其中一个主要内容，就表现为稀有金属的竞赛。谁能生产更多的稀有金属，谁能更多地发现和掌握稀有金属的性能，谁能做到稀有金属的高度提纯，谁就能生产各种高质量的合金和合金钢，就有高水平的机械工业和近代化的原子工业、电子工业以及国防工业。因此，稀有金属工业又代表着一个国家的工业化水平和科学技术水平。
    什么是稀有金属？这得从金属的分类谈起。到目前为止，已经发现蕴藏在自然界中的金属元素，一共有六十七种。其中除了铁、锰、铬三种叫做黑色金属外，下余六十四种都叫做有色金属。
    按自然界中蕴藏量的多寡，有色金属又分成两部分：一部分叫普通金属；一部分叫稀有金属。普通金属有十三种，它们的名称是：铜、铅、锌、铝、镁、锡、锑、镍、钠、钙、钾、钡、锶。除此以外，尚有五十一种都叫稀有金属。这五十一种稀有金属，按它们的性质和特点，大致可以归在六个大类里：
    第一类叫稀有轻金属。它们的特点是比重小、质量轻。在这一类里包括锂、铍、铷、铯四种金属。
    第二类叫稀有难熔金属。它们的特点是熔点高。在这一类里包括钛、锆、铪、钒、铌、钽、钼、钨、铼、钴十种金属。
    第三类叫稀散金属。它们的特点是矿体分散，都与其它矿物共生。在这一类里包括镓、铟、铊、锗四种金属。
    第四类叫放射性金属。它们具有天然放射性。在这一类里有铀、钋、钍、镭、锕、镤六种金属。
    第五类叫稀土金属。它们的天然氧化物像泥土。在这一类里有十六种金属，名称是：铈、镨、镧、钇、钪、钕、钐、铕、钆、铽、镝、钬、铒、铥、镱、镏。
    第六类叫贵金属，共有十一种，名称是：金、银、铂、铱、钯、钌、铑、锇、镉、铋、汞。
    稀有金属不但在地壳中的含量极少，而且矿体非常分散，提炼、提纯都很困难。因此，蕴藏量少，勘探难，提炼难，提纯难，就成为稀有金属的特点。假如没有高度的科学技术，就不可能发现它，即使发现了也提炼不出来。所以绝大多数的稀有金属的出现都是在十九世纪以后，而且发现了之后到正式生产差不多都经过了百把年的时间。
    我国是稀有金属蕴藏量极其丰富的国家。仅从很不完备的资料来看，全国大多数的省分都有丰富的矿藏，而且矿体相当集中，常常在一个矿里的藏量达到几千万吨。因此，很有可能稀有金属这个名词，在我国并不适用。
    但是储量丰富是一回事，勘探清楚、开采出来是一回事；冶炼提纯又是一回事。目前，我们在稀有金属的生产上还比较落后，我们必须在短期内迎头赶上！稀有金属工业的发展速度将标志着我国工业化的速度。
