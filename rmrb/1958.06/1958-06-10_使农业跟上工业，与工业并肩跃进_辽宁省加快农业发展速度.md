Make Agriculture Keep Up with Industry and Leap Forward Side by Side
Liaoning Province Accelerates Agricultural Development
(Our reporter Gao Fang reports from Shenyang on the 9th) The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction, is implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, with priority given to the development of heavy industry. Since the beginning of this year, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC, while continuing to strengthen its leadership over the construction of Liaoning's industrial base, has adopted the method of secretaries taking the lead, the entire party mobilizing, and the whole people being mobilized, to vigorously strengthen and improve the leadership over agricultural production and construction, so that agriculture can quickly catch up with the development of industry and leap forward side by side with industry.

Liaoning Province is one of the important bases for industrial construction in our country. In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the CPC has placed the focus of its leadership on industrial construction, and has achieved great results. Because the Provincial Committee concentrated its efforts on industry, it has relatively paid insufficient attention to the leadership of agricultural production and construction in the past few years, and the development of agricultural production in the province is very inconsistent with the development of industrial production and the growth rate of the urban population. As a result, the province's original situation of not being able to meet its own needs for grain, pork, and vegetable production and the situation of supply falling short of demand has become even more strained, and the deficit is increasing. The state needs to transfer about 1.2 million tons of grain, about 20,000 tons of pork, and about 80,000 tons of vegetables from other provinces every year to meet the needs of urban workers and residents. According to calculations, the state's operation of these materials will lose more than 20 million yuan every year. If the grain and pork supplied to Liaoning every year are exchanged on the international market, more than 1 million tons of steel can be exchanged.

If this contradiction of imbalanced industrial and agricultural development is not resolved for a long time, it will inevitably affect the high-speed development of industry and the continuous improvement of people's lives, which is detrimental to the entire socialist construction cause. To this end, the Second Session of the First Congress of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, held in late November last year, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, proposed to resolutely implement the Central Committee's policy of "simultaneously developing industry and agriculture with priority given to the development of heavy industry" and accelerate the development of agriculture. However, at that time, the leaders at all levels were still constrained by various right-leaning conservative ideas. According to the agricultural development speed proposed at that time, it would still take five years to achieve self-sufficiency in grain for the people of the province, two years to achieve self-sufficiency in pork, and one year to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables.

After the emergence of the situation of a comprehensive socialist leap forward in the country, the Provincial Committee convened a provincial rural work conference in early March this year. According to the Central Committee's spirit of "going all out, aiming high," a great debate was launched on whether agricultural production in the province could leap forward at a faster rate. The responsible cadres from various regions, counties, and townships participating in the conference thoroughly criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas such as satisfaction with the status quo, fear of leaping forward, and "theory of conditions only" through comparing enthusiasm, comparing plans, comparing measures, and comparing leadership, and liberated their minds from top to bottom. Finally, it was decided to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, pork, and vegetables in 1958. The main measures to achieve this leap forward plan are: in terms of grain production, it is necessary to greatly expand the area of ​​irrigated farmland, increase the application of manure, grow more high-yield crops, expand the area of ​​double cropping and intercropping, and restore wasteland; in terms of hog production, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of collective breeding as the main method, widely use substitute feed, and strengthen epidemic prevention; in terms of vegetable production, it is necessary to appropriately expand the planting area and strive to increase the yield per unit area.

After the meeting, in order to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan of "three self-sufficiency" in one year, the Provincial Committee and County Committees established the Agricultural Production Leap Forward Office to uniformly lead and comprehensively arrange various tasks of the agricultural leap forward. Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, due to the secretaries taking the lead, the entire party acting, and vigorously strengthening the leadership of agricultural production and construction, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production and construction has been greatly stimulated. The farmers of the province have worked hard in the spring and have achieved great production results. In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, the newly expanded paddy field area in the province is more than the total area of ​​paddy fields opened up in the province since the beginning of history, and the newly increased irrigated area of ​​dry land is equal to four and a half times the area of ​​dry land irrigation developed since the beginning of history. The transformation of low-lying areas along rivers and the construction of soil and water conservation projects in mountainous areas have achieved unprecedented results. For the first time in the history of the province, all cultivated land has been applied with base fertilizer, and the average fertilization rate per hectare has reached 106,000 jin, an increase of 1.8 times compared with last year. 60% of the province's grain fields are planted with high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes. More than one-third of the grain fields have adopted local effective advanced yield-increasing experiences such as mixed planting, intercropping, interplanting, and double cropping. In the spring sowing, the province restored the sowing of 90,000 hectares of wasteland. The sowing in the fields generally achieved early start, fast progress, good quality, and strong and neat seedlings, which was unprecedented. The number of hogs raised in the province has increased by 240,000 compared with the end of last year, and the vegetable sowing area in the suburbs of the ten major cities has increased by 60% this year compared with last year. The province has successfully completed the various plans and measures for the spring production leap forward, and has laid a reliable foundation for the province to achieve "three self-sufficiency" in one year.

    使农业跟上工业，与工业并肩跃进
    辽宁省加快农业发展速度
    本报沈阳9日电　记者高方报道：中共辽宁省委根据党的社会主义建设总路线，贯彻在优先发展重工业的条件下工农业同时并举的方针。今年以来中共辽宁省委在继续加强对辽宁工业基地建设工作的领导的同时，采取书记挂帅、全党动手、全民动员的方法，大力加强和改进对农业生产建设的领导，使农业迅速跟上工业的发展，与工业并肩跃进。
    辽宁省是我国工业建设的重要基地之一，几年来在中央的正确领导下，中共辽宁省委把领导重心放在工业建设方面，取得了巨大成绩。由于省委集中力量抓工业，几年来相对地对农业生产建设的领导就有些照顾不够，全省农业生产的发展和工业生产的发展、城市人口增长的速度很不相称。这样，就使这个省原来粮食、猪肉、蔬菜生产不能自给和供不应求的局面更加紧张，逆差越来越大，需要国家每年从外省调进粮食一百二十万吨左右、猪肉二万吨左右、蔬菜八万吨左右，供应城市职工和居民的需要。据计算，国家经营这些物资每年要亏损二千万元以上，如果把每年供给辽宁的粮食和猪肉在国际市场上进行交换，可以换到一百多万吨钢材。
    这种工农业发展不平衡的矛盾，长期不解决必将影响到工业的高速度发展和人民生活的不断提高，对整个社会主义建设事业不利。为此，去年11月下旬举行的中共辽宁省第一届代表大会第二次会议根据党的三中全会的精神，提出了要坚决贯彻中央“在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举”的方针，加速发展农业，但当时各级领导者由于还受着各种右倾保守思想的束缚，根据当时提出的农业发展速度，仍然需要五年才能做到全省人民吃粮自给、二年猪肉自给、一年蔬菜自给。
    全国出现社会主义全面大跃进的形势后，今年3月初省委召开的全省农村工作会议，根据中央“鼓足干劲，力争上游”的精神，对全省农业生产究竟能不能以更快的速度大跃进展开了大鸣大放大辩论。参加会议的各地、县、乡负责干部通过比干劲、比规划、比措施、比领导，彻底批判了满足现状、不敢跃进和“唯条件论”等各种右倾保守思想，从上到下解放了思想。最后确定1958年实现粮食、猪肉、蔬菜三自给。实现这一跃进规划的主要措施是：在粮食生产方面，要大大扩大农田灌溉面积、增施粪肥、多种高产作物、扩大复种套种面积、恢复撩荒地等；在生猪生产方面，要认真贯彻集体饲养为主的方针，广泛利用代用饲料，加强防疫工作；在蔬菜生产方面，要适当扩大种植面积，努力提高单位面积产量。
    会后，为了保证实现一年“三自给”的跃进规划，省委到县委成立了农业生产大跃进办公室，统一领导和全面安排农业大跃进的各种工作。由于认真贯彻工农业同时并举的方针，由于书记挂帅，全党动手，大力加强对农业生产建设的领导，大大激发了广大农民的生产建设积极性。全省农民大干一春，已取得了伟大的生产成绩。在农田水利建设方面，全省新扩大的水田面积，比全省有史以来开起的水田面积总和还要多，新增加的旱田灌溉面积等于有史以来所发展的旱田灌溉面积的四倍半。沿河地区洼改治涝和山区修筑水土保持工程都取得了史无前例的成绩。全省耕地有史以来第一次全部施了底粪，平均每公顷的施肥量达到十万六千斤，比去年增加了一点八倍。全省粮田60％种植了水稻、玉米、薯类等高产作物。有三分之一以上的粮田采用了混种、间种、套种、复种等当地行之有效的先进增产经验。全省在春播中恢复播种撩荒地九万公顷。大田播种普遍做到了动手早、进度快、质量好、苗齐苗旺是从来没有过的。全省生猪的饲养头数已比去年年底增加了二十四万头，十大城市郊区的蔬菜播种面积今年比去年增加了60％，胜利地完成了全省春季生产跃进的各项计划措施，已为全省一年实现“三自给”打下了可靠的基础。
