Wooden-Wheeled Rice Transplanter Born in Fujian

(Our dispatch) According to the Fujian Daily: The Changting County Handicraft Cooperative in Fujian Province has successfully trial-produced a boat-shaped wooden-wheeled rice transplanter. This is a significant innovation in agricultural tool reform.

This rice transplanter is composed of two foot-pedal gears, four transplanting finger wheels, and four seedling delivery slots, connected together. It also has a seedling-carrying boat slightly larger than an ordinary rice transplanting boat attached to the back. When transplanting, a person sits on the seedling-carrying boat, puts the seedlings on the seedling slots with both hands, and then steps on the two wooden wheels. The entire rice transplanter moves backward one step, and the four transplanting finger wheels rotate accordingly. The seedlings then pass through the seedling delivery slots and are planted into the field by the transplanting finger wheels, four seedlings in a row. The boat-shaped wooden-wheeled rice transplanter has been field-tested with good results. Its advantages are: high efficiency, after skilled operation, it will be more than twice as fast as manual transplanting; simple structure, any ordinary carpenter can imitate it at a glance; low cost, entirely made of wood, each unit costs less than ten yuan; easy to operate, generally women and semi-laborers can use it, and it can greatly reduce physical labor; easy to carry, it can be disassembled and assembled at any time, regardless of paddy fields or mountain fields, as long as it is three meters wide, it can be used.

This rice transplanter was created by Dai Maoyang, a doctor at the Changting Handicraft Cooperative's clinic. From the results, the wooden-wheeled rice transplanter is basically successful. With slight improvements, work efficiency will continue to increase and can be widely promoted and applied. Currently, Dai Maoyang has gone to the Changting County Agricultural Tool Factory to specifically study the problem of automating seedling delivery and separation in the rice transplanter. It is understood that the automatic seedling separation part has been designed and initially manufactured, and research is underway on how to closely link it with the transplanting action.

On May 25th and 26th, the wooden rice transplanter was transported to Fuzhou for a transplanting demonstration. Jiang Yizhen, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as responsible persons of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, agricultural experts, and agricultural cooperative members, all visited the demonstration. Everyone not only carefully observed the transplanting action of the rice transplanter, but also sat on the rice transplanter and personally operated and tested it.

Comrade Jiang Yizhen said while operating: "This rice transplanter has a simple structure and is easy to use. It does not require any special skills to ensure the quality of transplanting. In particular, it can greatly liberate heavy physical labor. This is a great success. It should be affirmed as the first step in the mechanization of rice transplanting, and it can now be widely promoted for trial use."

Agricultural experts and farmers, after trying it out, were also very satisfied with the reduction of fatigue. The farmers felt that using this machine for transplanting was a big step forward compared to transplanting boats. It is no longer necessary to bend over during operation, and stepping on the wooden wheels is not heavy. Operating day and night will not be tiring. Moreover, the elderly and children can use it, and the problem of a shortage of transplanting hands and labor shortages can be completely solved. Zhou Keyong, a professor at the Agricultural College, and Zheng Yimu, the head of the Gushan Fifth Cooperative, together inspected the quality of the transplanted rice seedlings, pulled up a few to look at, and believed that the depth of the seedling roots was consistent, and the seedlings were firmly planted but not too deep, reaching the level of skilled transplanting experts.

　　繁重的体力劳动将大大减轻
    木轮插秧机在福建诞生
    本报讯　据福建日报消息：福建省长汀县手工业联社试制成功船形木轮插秧机。这是农具改革中一项具有重要意义的创造。
    这种插秧机由两个脚踏齿轮、四个插秧指轮、四个送秧槽等联结而成，后面还挂一条比普通插秧船稍大的载秧船。插秧时，人坐在载秧船上，用两手把秧苗放在秧槽上，然后脚踩二个木轮，整个插秧机便往后移动一步，四个插秧指轮随之转动，秧苗便经过送秧槽和插秧指轮扎到田里，一排四株。船形木轮插秧机经过实地试验，效果良好。它的优点是：效率高，操作熟练后，将比人工插秧快一倍以上；构造简单，一般木匠一看便能仿制；成本低，全部由木料制成，每部成本不上十元；操作方便，一般妇女、半劳力均能使用，并可大大减轻体力劳动；携带方便，可以随拆随装，不管洋田、山田，只要有三公尺宽，就可使用。
    这部插秧机是长汀手工业联社医疗所医师戴茂扬创造的。从效果看，木轮插秧机基本上是成功的，只要稍加改进，工作效率还会继续提高，可以普遍推广应用。目前，戴茂扬已到长汀县农具厂专门研究如何使插秧机送秧、分秧实现自动化的问题。据了解自动分秧的部分已经设计和初步制造出来，正在研究如何与插秧的动作紧密联系起来。
    5月25、26两日，木制插秧机运到福州作了插秧表演。中共福建省委书记江一真和省农业厅的负责人、农业专家、农业社员，都参观了表演。大家不但仔细观察了插秧机插秧的动作，并且坐上插秧机，亲自操作试验。
    江一真同志一面操作一面说：“这架插秧机构造简单、使用轻便，不需要技术就能保证插秧质量，特别是可以使繁重的体力劳动获得大大解放，这就是一个很大的成功，应该肯定它是插秧机械化的第一步，现在就可以普遍推广试用。”
    农业专家和农民们试用后，也都对减轻疲劳这一点表示非常满意。农民们都觉得用这个机器插秧，比插秧船又大大进了一步，操作时不要再弯腰，脚踏木轮也不重，日夜操作都不会累。而且老人、小孩都可以用，插秧手缺乏、劳力紧张的问题就可以全部解决。农学院教授周可涌和鼓山五社社长郑依牳等一起检查了已插好的秧苗的质量，拔起几根来看，认为秧苗扎根深浅一致，扎得稳而不深，达到了插秧能手的水平。（附图片）
