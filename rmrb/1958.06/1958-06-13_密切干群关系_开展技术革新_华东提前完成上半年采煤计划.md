Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 12th: The mines under the Jinan Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry had, by June 7th, completed their first half-year production plan ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of the month, they will overproduce more than 1.2 million tons of raw coal in the first half of the year, an increase of 37.88% compared to the same period last year.

Through the rectification movement, the enterprises in East China have taken on a completely new look. The relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and many key production problems have been solved in a timely manner. In the past, workers at Xinwen Coal Mine had three complaints about cadres going down the mine: first, they didn't solve problems; second, they affected production by wandering around; and third, they pretended to know what they were doing and gave random directions. Now, they believe that cadres going down the mine has three benefits: first, they accurately grasp the key points; second, measures are taken in a timely manner; and third, it is easier to unify opinions. After the socialist education on "For whom are we laboring," the ideological awareness of the workers in various mines has been unprecedentedly enhanced, setting off a wave of "comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced," followed by the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement. The successful experiment of overall scraper conveyor shifting in the first mining area of Xiaqiao Mine has reduced the conveyor shifting time from six hours in the past to one hour (including preparation time), and implemented double-cycle operation, increasing output by 20% and improving the efficiency of coal miners by 30%.

    密切干群关系　开展技术革新
    华东提前完成上半年采煤计划
    据新华社济南12日电　煤炭工业部济南管理局所属各矿，到6月7日为止，提前完成了上半年产量计划；预计到月底，半年可以超产原煤一百二十多万吨，比去年同期增加37.88％。
    华东各矿通过整风运动，企业面貌焕然一新。干部和群众的关系密切了，许多生产关键问题及时得到了解决。新汶煤矿的工人过去看见干部下井有三烦：一烦不解决问题，二烦来逛窑影响生产，三烦不懂装懂乱指挥；现在他们认为干部下井有三好：一好关键抓得准，二好措施及时，三好意见容易统一。各矿经过“为谁劳动”的社会主义教育以后，职工思想觉悟空前提高，掀起了“比先进、赶先进”的热潮，随之而来的是技术革新运动的蓬勃开展。夏桥矿采煤一区试验整体移溜子成功，使移溜子时间从过去六小时缩短到一小时（包括准备时间在内），并且实行了双循环作业，增加产量20％，采煤工效率提高30％。
