Xinhua News Agency, June 15th – All able-bodied family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and the urban poor in various districts of Beijing have been organized to participate in production.

Currently, the total number of family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and urban poor participating in production in various districts of Beijing is over 6,700. They have formed 214 production groups, engaged in 80 types of production activities, including spinning thread, reeling thread, pasting cardboard boxes, bookbinding, making straw covers, making shoes, collecting scrap iron, dismantling rubber shoes, and serging sock tops. These jobs do not require high technical skills, are simple and easy to learn, and some involve processing or auxiliary labor for factories and enterprises. Production is organized according to local conditions, time, and individual circumstances. People can either concentrate on production in the production groups or take the work home. Generally, family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and the urban poor participating in production can earn about ten yuan or more per month, with the highest earning six or seventy yuan. Zhang Qijun, a resident who previously relied on state relief, now earns thirty yuan per month after participating in production and is able to support himself.

Currently, the various districts in the city are helping the newly established production groups of family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and the urban poor to consolidate and improve. The government still provides certain subsidies to family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and the poor who have already participated in production but still have difficulties in life. Necessary subsidies and relief are still provided to 461 households of the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled who have completely lost their ability to work.

    首都民政工作大跃进
    城区贫民全部参加生产
    新华社15日讯　北京市城区各区有劳动能力的烈属、军属和贫民，已经全部组织起来参加生产。
    北京市各城区目前参加生产的烈属、军属和城市贫民共有六千七百多人，他们组成了二百一十四个生产组，生产门路有纺线、络线、糊纸盒、装订、打草套、制鞋、拣钢铁、拆胶鞋、锁袜口等八十种。这些工作技术性不强，简便易学，有些是为工厂、企业进行加工或作辅助劳动。在生产中因地、因时、因人制宜，可以集中在生产组里生产，也可以把活带到家里去做。参加生产的烈属、军属和贫民，一般地每月都可以收入十元左右或者更多一些，最高的可以收入六、七十元。过去依靠国家救济的居民张其均参加生产后，每月收入三十元，已经能够自己养活自己。
    目前，城区各区正帮助新成立的烈属、军属和贫民生产组巩固和提高。对已经参加生产但在生活上仍有困难的烈军属和贫民，政府仍给予一定的补助；对四百六十一户完全丧失劳动力的老、弱、病、残户，还照常给予必要的补助和救济。
