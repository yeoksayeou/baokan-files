Everyone Proposes Topics, Everyone Answers
A Proposal to Promote the Great Leap Forward

Comrade Editor:

I suggest that the People's Daily open a column called "Everyone Names Topics." Between industries, such as farmers to industry, workers to agriculture, customers to commerce, as well as residents and students, etc., they can write down their legitimate demands and reasonable wishes. This can improve the imagination of people on the industrial and agricultural fronts and increase their creativity and sense of responsibility in daring to think and act.

People might think: Proposing topics and making it difficult for others, what kind of promotion can it play? Not so. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the Party put forward a general topic to the whole people and proposed the general line, which played a role in reversing the universe. However, some specific goals of some sub-industries are not detailed enough or forward-looking enough to meet the wishes of the whole people. Therefore, the realization of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's great call to march into nature may be partially affected and may not achieve the most complete and regret-free situation. It is very necessary to concentrate the wisdom of the majority through the call of newspapers and periodicals.

Let me give a few examples now. Take agriculture as an example:

If people see that the masses have been mobilized to collect mountain fruits for winemaking and tree seeds for oil extraction, this is a great thing, and it is also the first step for people to learn to seize wealth from nature. However, this is only the first step, because even if the enthusiasm of the masses in this regard can be sustained, we only collect what nature produces. Sometimes, it takes a lot of effort, and it is impossible to concentrate the use, or even outweigh the gains. This requires transforming nature. If we think of and use Michurin's theory when afforestation, and "graft" some generally used trees to make them have higher economic value, this can more fundamentally solve the problem of raw material sources for winemaking and oil extraction. Some people may say that this is a problem that botanists should first study in the experimental garden before they can bring it to the masses, and it is not good to mix it with mass movements. However, it is not. Modern science must take root among the masses from the very beginning in order to catch up with the objective situation. Taking grafting and cuttings as an example, our factory is now studying and producing a series of plant growth stimulants. The use of this drug can help plant rooting and greatly improve the survival rate of transplanted seedlings, which significantly reduces the technical complexity in this regard. Therefore, if we propose a topic such as "How to quickly improve and utilize wild fruit trees in the north and move oil crops to the north," it is a very realistic and important issue, and it is worth the relevant departments and personnel to spend some effort to study it.

For another example, the issue of wild economic animals, our country is currently still in the stage of actively eliminating harmful animals and producing more precious furs. On the other hand, in terms of protecting and actively cultivating biological resources, not enough attention has been paid. (For example, we still do not have an advanced legislation on hunting and precious animal protection.) In this way, in a few years, some animals will be on the verge of extinction, and the production of some precious furs will also decline year by year. Therefore, it should be timely to launch a nationwide movement focusing on the breeding of economic organisms and supplemented by the elimination of absolute pests (there are only a few such animals, such as jackals and wolves). The problem of mass production and supply of modern hunting gear and ammunition has been correspondingly raised.

In short, the call of the great general line needs to be embodied by thousands of different ways and detailed and precise specific actions. In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism, I hope that the above suggestions can be given due attention, and your newspaper will take the lead, and national newspapers and popular science publications will engage in the mass movement of "proposing topics."

    大家出题目　大家来回答
    促进大跃进的一个倡议
    编辑同志：
    我建议人民日报辟一个“大家点名出题目”的专栏。在行业与行业之间，例如农民对工业，工人对农业，顾客对商业以及居民、学生等都能把他们的正当要求和合理愿望写出来，这就可以提高在工农业战线上的人们的想像力，增加他们敢想敢做的创造力和责任感。
    人们或者会想：出题目，难难人，能起个什么促进作用？不然。在大跃进高潮中，党向全民出了总题目，提出总路线，起着旋转乾坤的作用。但是下面某些分行分业的具体目标还不够细致，不够高瞻远瞩，不能符合全民的愿望，因此，就可能使党中央、毛主席的向自然大进军的伟大号召的实现遭受部分影响，而不能达到最圆满、最无遗憾的境地。通过报刊的号召，集中多数人的智慧，是十分必要的。
    我现在举几个例子。拿农业来说：
    如果人们看到群众已经发动起来采集山果酿酒和树籽榨油，这是极大的好事，也是人们学会向自然夺取富源的第一步。然而这仅是第一步，因为即使群众在这方面的热情能够持久，仅是自然产什么，我们收什么，有时费力多，不能集中利用，甚至得不偿失。这就要改造自然。如果在造林的时候想到并且利用米丘林学说，把某些一般用的林木，经过“嫁接”使它变成有更高经济价值，这才能较根本的解决酿酒和榨油的原料来源问题。也许有人说这是要由植物学家先在试验园中研究好了，才能拿到群众中来的问题，不好与群众性运动混杂起来。然而不然，近代科学一定要一开始就在群众中生根，才能赶上客观形势。就拿嫁接、插条来说，我们厂现在研究生产一系列的植物生长刺激素，使用了这种药物，就能帮助植物生根，使移栽的树苗成活率大大提高，这就使这方面的技术复杂性显著降低了。因而如果我们提出：“怎样迅速改良利用北地野生果树，和使油料作物北移”这样一个课题，就是非常现实而且重要的问题，值得有关部门和人员下点功夫研究的了。
    又如，野生经济动物问题，我国目前还是停留在积极除害兽和多生产珍贵皮毛的阶段。而在这问题的另一面——保护和积极培育生物资源方面，注意的就还不够。（譬如我们到现在还没有一个先进的有关狩猎和珍贵动物保护的立法。）这样，不要多少年，有些动物就将濒于绝种，某些珍贵的皮毛的产量也将逐年下降。因此开展一个以繁育经济生物为主，以消灭绝对害兽（这种动物只有豺、狼等很少几种）为辅的全国性的运动，应该是适时的了。大量生产和供应现代化的猎具、弹药问题，就相应地被提了出来。
    总之，伟大的总路线的号召是需要有千千万万不同方式，细致精工的具体行动来体现的。为了充分发挥群众建设社会主义的积极性，希望上述建议能得到应有的重视，由你报登高一呼，全国报刊以及通俗科学刊物，都来搞“出题目”的群众运动。　孙纪昌
