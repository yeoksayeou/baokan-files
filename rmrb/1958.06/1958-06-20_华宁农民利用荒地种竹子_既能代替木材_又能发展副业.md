    Huaning Farmers Use Wasteland to Grow Bamboo
    Can Replace Timber and Develop Sideline Occupations
    (Our Report) Yunnan's Huaning County, despite a very serious drought, has already planted nearly 100,000 clumps of bamboo. According to the county committee's decision, more than 300,000 clumps, or about 10,000 mu, will be planted this year. The people of Huaning County fully recognize the role of developing bamboo in enhancing their economic life. Although it has not rained for nine months this year, they are actively planting bamboo by carrying water to plant them. Huaning, like many places in Yunnan, has a mild climate, with many barren hills and wastelands suitable for bamboo planting, and the vast majority of rural people also have the habit of planting bamboo. With the increasing development of economic life, Huaning County also feels that bamboo resources are insufficient. Therefore, actively developing bamboo has become a good way for them to solve the difficulty of lacking timber and develop sideline occupations. The experience of Huaning County in planting bamboo proves that bamboo income will account for more than 30% of their total agricultural income.
    Now is the time for "planting bamboo when peaches turn red." In order to do a good job in planting bamboo during the rainy season, Huaning County has decided to set up special personnel in counties, districts, and townships to be responsible for solving problems in bamboo cultivation.

    华宁农民利用荒地种竹子
    既能代替木材　又能发展副业
    本报讯　云南华宁县在旱象十分严重的情况下，已种下竹子近十万蓬。根据县委会的决定，今年还将种植三十多万蓬约一万多亩。华宁县的人民群众充分认识到发展竹子对增进经济生活的作用，虽然今年有九个月不下雨，也用挑水栽竹的办法积极种植竹子。华宁同云南很多地方一样，气候温和，荒山荒地多，宜于栽种竹子，农村广大群众也有栽竹的习惯。随着经济生活的日益发展，华宁县亦感到竹源不足，因此，积极发展竹子就成为他们解决缺乏木材困难，发展副业的一个好门径。华宁县种植竹子的经验证明，竹子的收入将占他们农业总收入的30％以上。
    现在已经到了“桃子红栽竹子”的时候了，华宁县为了在雨季把种竹的工作作好，已决定县区乡设置专人，负责解决培植竹子当中的问题。
