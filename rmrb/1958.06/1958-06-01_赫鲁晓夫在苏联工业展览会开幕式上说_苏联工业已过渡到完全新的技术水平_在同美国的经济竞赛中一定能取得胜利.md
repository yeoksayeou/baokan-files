Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 31st: The 1958 Soviet Industrial Exhibition opened in Moscow today. This exhibition fully demonstrates the new achievements of Soviet industry and science and technology.

    Speaking at the opening ceremony, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, said that we believe that in the economic competition with the United States, we will definitely be able to achieve victory, because the high labor productivity guaranteed by socialism is beyond the reach of the capitalist system.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联工业展览会开幕式上说
    苏联工业已过渡到完全新的技术水平
    在同美国的经济竞赛中一定能取得胜利
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　1958年苏联工业展览会今天在莫斯科开幕，这次展览会充分显示出苏联工业和科学技术的新成就。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在开幕式上讲话时说，我们相信，在同美国进行经济竞赛中，我们一定能够取得胜利，因为社会主义所保证的高度劳动生产率是资本主义制度所望尘莫及的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联工业现在已经过渡到完全新的技术水平。现在开幕的这个展览会反映了这个过渡，它表明，苏联完全有条件在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上最发达的资本主义国家。苏联领导人伏罗希洛夫、勃列日?夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克和波斯别洛夫都出席了开幕式。
    今年的展览会有二十一个展览馆，共展出了六万件展览品，比去年多了一万件。展览品集中显示出苏联在改组国民经济管理方法、采用新技术、发展重工业和轻工业生产的突出成就。今年展出的机器品种有一半以上是第一次展出的。
    展览会展出的各种自动化的工具和仪器比往年多得多，这显示出自动化是苏联工业生产的一个重要方向。今年新开设了三个新的展览馆——“化学工业馆”、“科学馆”和“地质、石油、煤气馆”。
    轻工业和日用品工业在展览会中也占着重要的位置，仅丝织品就有七百多种新产品展出。
