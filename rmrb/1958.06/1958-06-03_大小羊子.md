　　Big Lamb and Little Lamb
　　Méi Wū (枚屋)
    I lived in the home of a poor peasant old lady, she had three sons. The eldest and the youngest were both born in the year of the sheep, one was called Big Lamb and one was called Little Lamb.
    As soon as I arrived, I became friends with Little Lamb. At that time, Big Lamb was serving in the military away from home and hadn't returned yet. Little Lamb accompanied me from door to door to visit, and he introduced me to the living conditions of almost every household in the village, sometimes adding his own comments. He took me to collect manure early in the morning, and pulled me to catch fish and eels at noon. He reminded me of the local customs and habits. He took me to the market. After class, he worked with me and taught me the secret to using a large shovel.
    Little Lamb started school late and was already a teenager when he was in the third grade of elementary school. He said that whether he would continue studying next semester would depend on Big Lamb's return. He was very proud of Big Lamb and also encouraged me to make friends with Big Lamb.
    Three days before the Spring Festival, we were carrying pond mud back under the gasoline lamp when we discovered that Big Lamb had suddenly come home. Big Lamb was a handsome and energetic rural youth. Before even taking off his military uniform, he went down to the pond to carry mud. He carried a lot and ran fast, still maintaining the true qualities of a farmer. The army was like a school, teaching him a lot of revolutionary principles and culture, and his words and deeds were obviously different from three years ago. The team members welcomed him very much, elected him as a work point evaluator, and also recommended him to be the village announcer. After he came back, our family life became even more organized. He got up early every morning to fill the water tank, and after returning from the fields, he busied himself with the vegetable garden and studying culture, never idle for a moment. He was especially strict with Little Lamb, checking his homework every other day, urging him to wash his face and brush his teeth, not allowing him to argue about work points, and not allowing him to pick easy tasks. Little Lamb also listened to him very much.
    Once the winter vacation was over, Little Lamb was going to study "third grade, second semester". Big Lamb planned the family's finances: he planned to get married this year and also wanted to build two houses... and decided to temporarily not let Little Lamb go to school, but instead have him herd cows at home to increase income. Every night, I taught Little Lamb to read. Little Lamb was also very willing. He immediately asked Big Lamb for the money to buy textbooks, saying that he would go to the market with me next time it was held.
    The longer we spent together, the deeper our understanding became. I saw that Big Lamb set an example in everything he did at home and had a high level of prestige, but unconsciously, the volume of his voice became louder and louder, and the tone of his accusations became more and more frequent, as if once he issued an order, the whole family only had to obey. Sometimes it made the whole family quite unhappy, and the old lady also complained about him from time to time. I wanted to talk to Big Lamb, but... it can also be said to be a common problem of intellectuals: fearing things at hand, hesitating, and worrying.
    One day, Little Lamb came home from herding the cows and found that the bottom half of his pen was missing, but the cap was still neatly inserted in his pocket. Big Lamb had brought this pen to Little Lamb when he was in the army, and Little Lamb always liked to keep it on him, taking it out to write whenever he was happy. Little Lamb didn't even bother to eat his meal and rushed to the fields to look for it, but where could he find it! The old lady and I were worried about Little Lamb, fearing that Big Lamb would scold him.
    Big Lamb came back from plowing the fields and, as expected, scolded Little Lamb sternly: "A pen is for writing, not for looking good. How many times have I told you not to bring a pen when herding cows? You just don't accept advice..." Big Lamb was so angry that his neck turned red, and he raised his hand and slapped Little Lamb twice on the back of the head. By the time I stepped forward to stop him, it was already too late. The old lady still wanted to protect Little Lamb, saying, "Look in the drawer again." Big Lamb became even more furious when he heard this, took out the bottom half of the pen from his pocket, and threw it into Little Lamb's hand: "If I hadn't found it while plowing, it would have been buried in the dirt long ago. And you're still looking in the drawer? You're so careless, what's the point of studying culture? You might as well not buy the textbooks!" Big Lamb said it and did it, forcing Little Lamb to return the money for the books to him.
    The next day, it was drizzling. Little Lamb was holding his breakfast bowl, staring blankly into space. I asked him why, and he said he had a headache. At this time, Big Lamb was plowing the fields, and the old lady was groping around, not knowing what she was doing. It just so happened that it was just the two of us left. Little Lamb looked at me, and something seemed to be stuck in his throat as he said, "It's not allowed to hit children now, and especially not on the head, hitting the head will cause headaches. When children make mistakes, they should be educated... My older brother doesn't have as good a temper as you. You're the only one in the family who's good to me." He also told me, "You can't tell my older brother this."
    Hearing these words, it was as if five flavors were mixed together. I felt an indescribable taste in my heart. Little Lamb's display of affection, treating me like a brother and revealing his innermost feelings, moved me greatly.
    In the afternoon, braving the rain, Big Lamb and I went to the town to pick out sweet potato seeds. Little Lamb's words lingered in my mind, and I walked silently along the way. In the end, I couldn't help it, and I said to Big Lamb, "I have an opinion, I want to discuss it with you, I don't know if it's right?..." Once I opened my mouth, it was like pulling the stopper out of a kettle, and I poured out all my opinions of Big Lamb. Of course, I didn't mention Little Lamb's words at all. I had to keep my promise to Little Lamb. Big Lamb thought for a moment and only said one sentence: "Yes, your opinion is correct."
    When I got home, I was naturally very tired and plopped down, suddenly remembering that I had forgotten to do one thing: on the way, I had planned to quietly go to the town's supply and marketing cooperative to buy Little Lamb's textbooks back, to smooth over this small dispute. Damn it, I forgot. Big Lamb also came into the house. He changed out of his wet pants and pulled a language textbook out of his pocket. He said to himself, and also to Little Lamb, "The arithmetic books are sold out, they won't be available for two more days."
    Little Lamb looked at me, with a smile and a hint of blame in his eyes. He still thought I had revealed his secret.

### 大小羊子

专栏：

　　大小羊子
　　枚屋
    我住在一位贫农老太太家里，她有三个儿子。老大和老三都肖羊，一个叫大羊子，一个叫小羊子。
    我一来就跟小羊子交上了朋友。那时大羊子服兵役在外，还没有回家。小羊子陪我挨家挨户去串门，他几乎把全村每家的生活情况都对我作了一番介绍，有时还加上他的评语。清早带我去拾粪，中午拉我去摸鱼、捕黄鳝。他提醒我这里的风俗习惯。领我去赶集。课余，与我一起劳动，还教我使用大锹的诀窍。
    小羊子入学迟，十几岁了，才读初小三年级。他说下学期还念不念书，要等大羊子回来决定。他对大羊子是很夸耀的，也撺掇我跟大羊子交上朋友。
    春节前三天，我们在汽油灯下挑塘泥回来，发现大羊子突然到家了。大羊子是个漂漂亮亮的、生龙活虎的农村青年。军服未脱就下塘挑泥，挑得多，跑得快，不失庄稼人的本色，部队像一所学校，教他学了不少革命道理和文化，说话做事又显然与三年前不同。小队队员很欢迎他，选他当评工员，又推选他叫喇叭筒子。他回来以后，我们家庭的生活也更有条理了。他一早起身就把水缸挑得满满的，下地回来忙着弄菜园、学文化，一刻不闲。对小羊子的要求尤其严格，三天两头检查他的作业，督促他洗脸刷牙，不许他吵工分，不准他挑活干。小羊子也很听他的话。
    寒假一过，小羊子要读“三下”了。大羊子计划了一下家庭经济：他打算今年结婚，还想盖两间房子……，决定暂且不让小羊子上学，叫他在家放牛，增加一点收入。每晚，由我教小羊子读书。小羊子也很愿意，当时就向大羊子要了买课本的钱，说下次逢集同我一起去买。
    相处久了，彼此了解也深一层。我看大羊子在家里处处以身作则，威信很高，可是不知不觉中，他说话嗓门一天大似一天，指责口吻一天多似一天了，仿佛他一发号施令，全家只有照办的份。有时弄得一家子颇不愉快，老太太也对他时有怨言。我想跟大羊子谈谈，可是……也可以说是知识分子的通病：临事而惧，趑趄，顾虑。
    一天，小羊子放牛回家，发现他的钢笔丢了下半节，笔套还好好插在口袋上。这是大羊子在部队时捎给小羊子的，小羊子老爱插在身上，一高兴就拿下来写。小羊子饭也顾不得吃，拔脚就往田里去找，哪里还找得到喔！老太太和我都为小羊子担心，生怕大羊子说他。
    大羊子耕田回来，果然声色惧厉地训斥小羊子：“钢笔是写字的，又不是要好看的，我说过多少回，让你放牛别带钢笔？就是不接受意见……”大羊子气得脖子也红了，举起手来朝小羊子的后脑勺子上拍拍打了两下，待我上前阻拦已经来不及了。老太太还想护着小羊子，说：“抽屉里再找找看。”大羊子听了更是火上加油，身上掏出半节钢笔，朝小羊子手中一扔：“要不是我耕田拣到，早就入了土了，还往抽屉里找呢？这样不要好，还学什么文化。干脆课本也别买啦！”大羊子说得到，做得到，逼着小羊子把书钱退给他。
    第二天，下着牛毛雨。小羊子捧着早饭碗，呆呆地出神，我问他为什么，他说头痛。这时大羊子在耕田，老太太摸摸索索不知做什么事去了，正好就剩我们俩。小羊子看了我一眼，喉咙口鲠了什么似地说：“现在不兴打小孩，更不能打脑袋，打脑袋会头痛的。小孩犯了错误，应当教育……大哥脾气没有你好，全家就是你跟我好。”还叮咛道：“这话不能对我大哥说。”
    听了这几句话，如同五味失调，我心里有一种说不出的滋味。小羊子对我亲如手足、披肝沥胆的感情流露，使我感动极了。
    下午，冒着雨，我和大羊子一同上镇去挑山芋种子。小羊子的话牵萦着我，一路上我默默而行。终究忍不住了，我对大羊子说：“我有个意见，想跟你商量商量，不知对不对？……”一开了口，就像水壶拔去了塞子，我把对大羊子的意见，全部倒了出来。当然，我半句也未提小羊子的话，我要守信于小羊子。大羊子思索了一下，只说了一句：“是的，你的意见是对的。”
    回到家，我自然很累了，一屁股坐下，猛然想起忘了办一件事：途中我曾打算，悄悄地到镇上供销社把小羊子的课本买回来，为这件小纠纷打个圆场。该死竟忘了。大羊子也进屋来了，他把湿漉漉的裤子换下，在裤兜里摸出一本语文课本，他像自言自语，又像对小羊子说：“算术卖完了，要过两天才有。”
    小羊子对我望望，眼光中有微笑，有责怪。他还以为我泄漏了他的秘密。
