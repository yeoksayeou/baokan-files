Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do!

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: Song Kechen, a staff member of the Anhui Provincial Grain Bureau who only attended school for half a year, has successfully created a grain dispenser that can automatically calculate grain prices, tally accounts, and weigh grain. The use of this grain dispenser can fundamentally solve the problem of people queuing to buy grain. It can also free grain sellers from the heavy physical labor of dispensing and loading grain, as well as the tedious accounting work. It provides extremely favorable conditions for the mechanization of grain stores.
    This grain dispenser consists of thirteen components, including a weighing scale, a calculation disk, a cumulative counter, a controller, and a modified large wooden box. When selling grain, a simple turn of the machine's crank reveals the price of the rice on the calculation disk. Then, pulling the controller and stepping on the machine's foot pedal causes the desired amount of rice to flow from the outlet, while simultaneously automatically accumulating the quantity of rice sold. It only requires one person to operate and can sell grain two or three times per minute, totaling over 20,000 jin of grain per day.
    This grain dispenser is 100% accurate in calculating grain prices, accumulating grain quantities, and weighing the weight of the grain. Its cost is only about 200 yuan. The Anhui Provincial Grain Bureau has decided to promote it throughout the province.
    This newspaper reports: Zhou Runsheng, head of the business team of the Jianqiao District Grain Management Office in Hangzhou City, and all his staff, after more than half a month of painstaking research, have used the original weighing scale to trial-produce an electric-operated automatic rice weighing machine.
    Using this electric rice weighing machine, the cashier only needs to press the electric button to calculate the price of the variety and quantity required by the customer. After the customer pays, an electric bell and light signal will notify the customer to collect the grain. After the customer places the rice bag, the machine will automatically weigh the rice for the customer.
    The cost of each of these electric rice weighing machines is less than 200 yuan. Using this weighing machine can eliminate errors, eliminate retail losses, and enable grain sellers to be freed from heavy physical labor.

    售粮用机器　买粮不排队
    宋克臣创造售粮器　周润生制成称米机
    据新华社合肥电　只读过半年书的安徽省粮食厅工作人员宋克臣，创造成功一种能自动计算粮价、累计账目、磅称粮食的售粮器。使用这种售粮器，可以从根本上解决群众排队买粮的问题，还可以把售粮员从发粮、装粮的笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的结账工作中解脱出来，并且为粮店实现机械化操作提供了极有利的条件。
    这种售粮器由一架磅秤、一个计算盘、一个累计器、一只控制器和一只改装过的大木箱等十三个部件构成。售粮时，手转动一下机器的摇把，计算盘上顿时就露出售米的粮价；接着手拉一下控制器，脚踩一下机器的脚踏，要售的米就从出口处流了出来，同时自动地累计售米的数量。它只要一人操作，每分钟能出售粮食两三笔，一天能出售粮食两万多斤。
    这种售粮器计算粮价、累计粮食数量和磅称粮食的重量，都百分之百的准确。它的造价只需二百元左右。现在安徽省粮食厅决定在全省推广。
    本报讯　杭州市笕桥区粮食管理所业务组组长周润生和全体职工，经过半个多月的苦心钻研，利用原有的磅称，试制成一架用电操纵的自动称米机。
    使用了这架电动称米机，出纳员只需揿动电钮，便能够计算出顾客所需品种数量的货价，顾客付款以后，电铃、电灯信号会通知顾客取粮；顾客将米袋放好，机器就自动把米称给顾客。
    这种电动称米机，每架成本还不到二百元。使用这种称米机，能消灭差错，消灭零售损耗，而且能使售粮员摆脱笨重的体力劳动。
