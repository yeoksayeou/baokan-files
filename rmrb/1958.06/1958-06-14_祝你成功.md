    "Wish You Success"
    This is a Soviet feature film with a bright style and novel subject matter, depicting how young people should approach life, learning, and work.
    Andrei is a young man without a definite goal in life, who spends his days cracking jokes. His cousin Alyosha—a lumberjack who came to his house to wait for university entrance exams—fought against all his incorrect ideas. Later, Andrei, who was very casual about life, finally followed his cousin to become a lumberjack, going to life to temper himself. Seeing this, we cannot help but think of the name of the film, and sincerely wish him success! (Zhi)

    “祝你成功”
    这是一部风格明快、题材新颖的苏联故事片，描写了青年人应该怎样对待生活、学习和工作。
    安德烈是个对生活没有一定目标、整天只说俏皮话的年青人，他的表哥阿辽沙——一个伐木工人来到他家等着考大学时，跟他那种种不正确的思想进行了斗争。后来对生活非常随便的安德烈，终于跟着表哥去当伐木工人，走向生活去锻炼了。看到这里，我们不期而然地想到了这影片的名字，并衷心地祝他成功！（之）
