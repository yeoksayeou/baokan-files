Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd, Vienna Dispatch: The Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation opened in Vienna on the 1st. Nearly five hundred delegates from sixty countries, as well as representatives from various international organizations, are participating in the conference. Some delegations are still en route to Vienna.

The President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Mrs. Gordon, delivered a report entitled "The Current Role and Responsibility of Women and the Tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation."

In her report, Mrs. Gordon said, "For the sake of our children's happy lives, we are determined to do everything in our power. We will strive to unite our forces to oppose the most serious danger facing all mankind today, atomic war; we must unite to eradicate war and strive for the peaceful resolution of all (international) disputes. This is our main task."

Mrs. Gordon then said that the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing has been warmly welcomed by the people of all countries. The peoples of all countries are stepping up their opposition to the testing of atomic weapons, and the number of protest demonstrations has increased, especially in Britain and the United States. Women and women's organizations have sent many protests to governments and international organizations.

Mrs. Gordon then pointed out the changes taking place in the world due to the people of all countries striving for independence. She said that wherever people are suffering from political and economic dependence, they are striving for liberation, and women are a major force in this struggle. This has been clearly demonstrated at the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

Mrs. Gordon's report also attached great importance to women's struggle for their own rights.

Mrs. Gordon said that the conference will discuss three main issues, for which three meetings will be held within the framework of the conference. The central topic will be the discussion of the conditions for women to fulfill their roles as mothers and working citizens in society. The second meeting will discuss the right to educate and nurture children and young people in the spirit of peace and friendship among peoples. The third meeting will discuss the issue of peace, which women cherish so much.

Mrs. Gordon concluded by saying that the Women's International Democratic Federation should loudly proclaim its will to defend peace with all its might, that it should be closer to the peace movement than ever before, and that it should create a strong public opinion to promote disarmament and peaceful coexistence among peoples. These two issues will be discussed at the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation, which will open in Stockholm on July 16.

Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd, Vienna Dispatch: The Austrian Democratic Women's Federation organized an international women's meeting in Vienna on the 2nd to celebrate International Children's Day.

Those present warmly welcomed the delegates from various countries who are in Vienna to attend the Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation. The President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Mrs. Gordon, the head of the Soviet delegation, Popova, and others were elected to the honorary presidium of the meeting.

The President of the Austrian Democratic Women's Federation, Zubik, delivered a speech, welcoming the representatives of the Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

In her speech, Mrs. Gordon pointed out the need to unite all forces against the atomic threat.

Representatives from Argentina, Senegal, the Soviet Union, Australia, West Germany, and Japan spoke at the meeting. When the Soviet representative Popova mentioned the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing, the hall resounded with warm and prolonged applause.

After the celebration, a concert was held, in which outstanding musicians and actors from Vienna participated.

    全世界妇女的当前主要任务
    广泛团结起来根除战争威胁
    国际妇联代表大会开幕  戈登夫人作报告
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社维也纳1日讯：国际民主妇女联合会第四届代表大会1日在维也纳开幕。参加大会的有来自六十个国家的将近五百名代表以及各国际组织的代表。还有一些代表团正在来维也纳途中。
    国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人在会上作了报告，报告的题目是“妇女当前的作用和责任与国际民主妇女联合会的任务”。
    戈登夫人在报告中说，为了我们孩子的幸福生活，我们决心做到我们的力量所能做的一切。我们将努力团结我们的力量来反对全人类现在所面临的最严重的危险，反对原子战争；我们还要团结一致来根除战争，争取通过和平途径解决一切（国际）争端。这就是我们的主要任务。
    戈登夫人接着说，苏联关于单方面停止核武器试验的决定受到各国人民的热烈欢迎。各国人民都在加紧反对试验原子武器，抗议示威的次数增多了，特别是在英国和美国。妇女和妇女组织纷纷向各国政府和国际组织发出了许多抗议书。
    戈登夫人接着指出世界上由于各国人民争取独立所发生的变化。她说，不论什么地方，备受政治和经济不独立之苦的人民都竭力争取解放，在这一斗争中妇女是其中的一个主要力量。这一点在亚非团结大会上已明显地表现出来。
    戈登夫人的报告也极其重视妇女争取本身权利的斗争。
    戈登夫人说，大会将讨论三个主要问题，为此在大会范围内将举行三个会议。作为中心议题的将是关于使妇女在社会上执行母亲和劳动公民的作用的条件的讨论。第二个会议将讨论关于以和平和各国人民友好的精神来教育和培养儿童和青年的权利问题。第三个会议将讨论妇女所极其珍视的和平问题。
    戈登夫人最后说，国际民主妇女联合会应当高声宣布自己全力保卫和平的意志，它应当比过去任何时候都更加接近和平运动，并且造成一种强有力的舆论来促进裁军和各国人民和平共处。这两个问题将在7月16日在斯德哥尔摩开幕的争取裁军和国际合作大会上讨论。
    新华社2日讯  据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利民主妇女联合会为庆祝国际儿童节2日在维也纳组织了国际妇女会见。
    到会的人热烈欢迎正在维也纳参加国际民主妇女联合会代表大会的各国代表。国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人、苏联代表团团长波波娃等人被选入会议的荣誉主席团。
    奥地利民主妇女联合会主席祖比克致词，欢迎国际民主妇女联合会代表大会的代表。
    戈登夫人发言时指出必须团结一切力量反对原子威胁。
    阿根廷、塞内加尔、苏联、澳大利亚、西德和日本的代表在会上讲了话。苏联代表波波娃在提到苏联单方面停止试验核武器的决定时，会场上响起了热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    庆祝会之后举行了音乐会，维也纳的优秀音乐家和演员参加了演出。
