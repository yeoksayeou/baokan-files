    The Story of Thermal Expansion and Contraction of Metals
    Mi Yang
    When trains were first invented, people laid the tracks without considering thermal expansion and contraction, nailing them tightly together one by one. As a result, in the summer, the rails expanded, causing the entire railway to buckle and become distorted. Now, people have learned their lesson and leave gaps between each rail when laying tracks to allow room for expansion.
    The Eiffel Tower in Paris is world-famous. In the morning, when the sun rises, the east-facing side of the tower heats up and begins to expand, while the west side remains cold, causing the entire tower to lean westward. At noon, the south side of the tower is hotter than the north side, so the tower leans northward. In the evening, it leans eastward. Someone made a measurement and found that the tip of the tower moved westward by about fifteen centimeters (about half a Chinese foot) between sunrise and two hours after sunrise. It is also seventeen centimeters taller in the hot summer than in the cold winter.
    Bullets fit very tightly in the gun barrel. This ensures that the bullet flies straight along the axis of the barrel when fired. However, after prolonged shooting, the barrel heats up and begins to expand. As a result, the bullet collides inside, reducing the accuracy of the shot and easily damaging the barrel. This phenomenon is particularly severe with machine guns. Light machine gunners frequently pour water on the barrel during combat for this reason. Heavy machine guns have a jacket outside the barrel filled with water, preventing them from heating up and expanding too much.
    Good concrete used in construction should have roughly the same thermal expansion and contraction properties as steel reinforcing bars. We often see cracks in concrete slabs or other components. One reason is that the steel reinforcing bars expand and contract more than the concrete.

    金属热胀冷缩的故事
    米扬
    火车刚发明的时候，人们铺设铁轨，没有考虑到它的热胀冷缩，而把它紧紧地一根一根钉在一起，结果到了夏天，铁轨伸长了，把整个铁路都挤得弯弯曲曲。现在人学乖了，铺铁路时每条轨间都留一个缝隙作为它们伸张的余地。
    巴黎爱菲尔铁塔是世界上很有名的。早晨，太阳升起的时候铁塔朝东的一面晒热了，开始伸长，朝西的依然是冷的，于是整个铁塔就向西倾斜；到了中午，塔的南面就比北面热，所以塔就向北倾斜；到了晚上则向东倾斜。有人做了一个测量，发现塔尖在早晨日出之前和日出两小时以后向西移动了大约有十五公分（半市尺左右）的距离，酷暑比严冬的时候要长十七公分。
    枪弹在枪管中嵌得是非常紧密的，这就保证了发射时弹丸能沿着枪膛的轴线一直飞出去，可是射击久了枪膛就要发热，并且开始膨胀，于是弹丸就要在里面左右碰撞，射击的命中率就降低了，并且枪筒也很容易损坏。机关枪这种现象特别严重，轻机枪射手在作战时不时往枪筒上淋水就是这个道理。重机枪因为在枪膛外面有一个夹层，在夹层里灌满了水，所以不致发热膨胀得太厉害。
    建筑上好的混凝土，它的热胀冷缩的本领和钢筋是应该大致相同的，我们常常看到一些混凝土板或者其他构件开裂，原因之一就是钢筋伸长缩短的本领比混凝土大的原故。
