　　Hangzhou Residents Widely Participate in Sports Activities

    This newspaper reports: May is the "National Fitness Activity Month" in Hangzhou. The city's slogan of "Everyone exercise, everyone healthy, full of vigor, build the motherland" for the great leap forward in sports has deeply rooted in people's hearts. During the activity month, more than 200,000 workers, cadres, students, and street residents in the city have participated in physical exercises. More than 200 residential areas in the city's streets and lanes (out of about 400 residential areas in the city), and more than 10,000 residents have started doing calisthenics. Mass sports activities have taken on a new look, and everyone participating in physical exercise has begun to form a trend.

    All 40 residential areas in Yuewang Road Street, Ding'an Street, and Haierxiang Street have launched calisthenics. They have all trained their own instructors, and many residents insist on doing it twice a day. More than 800 residents in the 11 residential areas of Yuewang Road Street participated in calisthenics (accounting for more than 50% of the residents in the area who can participate in physical exercise). On May 15th, Yuewang Road also held the first residents' sports meeting, with calisthenics and tug-of-war as the competition events.

    In order to strive for 300,000 people in the city to participate in physical exercise during the activity month, Shangcheng and Xiacheng have decided to participate in the city's first residents' sports meeting. (Zhou Qi)
