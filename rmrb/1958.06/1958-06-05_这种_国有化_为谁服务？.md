Whom Does This "Nationalization" Serve?
　　Leshan
    On May 14th, Sir Bowman, head of the British Coal Industry Administration—the agency responsible for managing nationalized coal enterprises—held a press conference in London to explain the agency's 1957 report on the British coal industry. Bowman pointed out that the British Coal Industry Administration had a deficit of as much as £5.3 million in 1957, and the estimated deficit for 1958 would be even greater.
    However, shortly before this press conference, the British Labour Party published a booklet entitled "A Story of Success," boasting about the achievements of the nationalization measures taken in the British coal industry, civil aviation, transportation, electricity, and gas industries.
    Let us see what the Labour Party's so-called "achievements" of coal industry nationalization mean.
    Due to backward mining methods and outdated equipment, the British coal industry had long been in a state of depression. The interests of British monopoly capital required the reorganization and re-equipment of the mines, but the coal mine capitalists had other ideas and were reluctant to move forward. The Federation of British Industries had long proposed that the state should pay for the re-equipment of the mines. In 1938, the Conservative Party also proposed a so-called state redemption of coal mines.
    After World War II, coal mine owners closed some unprofitable mines, which left Britain in a severe coal shortage. It was estimated that Britain was short of 5 million tons of coal a year at that time. Due to the coal shortage, industries that used coal as fuel were unable to start work or had great difficulty doing so. This affected Britain's competitive strength in the capitalist world market on the one hand; on the other hand, the large number of unemployed people domestically was bound to sharpen the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. How to restore the coal mining industry and thus strengthen Britain's capitalist economy became a key issue at the time. After the Labour Party came to power in 1945, it decided to implement coal industry nationalization from January 1947. This decision fully complied with the interests of monopoly capital and was therefore warmly welcomed by capitalists, especially the Coal Owners' Association. After the Conservative Party came to power in 1951, the coal industry nationalization measures remained largely unchanged.
    When coal industry nationalization began to be implemented, the British Coal Industry Administration originally announced that the total amount of monetary compensation to mine owners was £164,660,000, later increased to £353,330,000, and finally increased to £400 million. The repeated increase in the total amount of monetary compensation was of course very beneficial to the mine owners. However, this was not surprising, because the main leaders of the Coal Industry Administration at that time were all mine owners.
    According to regulations, the compensation was to be paid off within 50 years. Before it was paid off, the mine owners received interest on the bonds every year. The original interest rate of 2.5% was also raised to 3.5% by themselves.
    According to the British magazine "Labour Research," the British Coal Industry Administration had to pay £27,988,000 in interest each year, of which £16,600,070 was interest on bonds paid to mine owners, and the rest was interest on loans for expanding equipment. The interest income from bonds received by mine owners each year has exceeded twice the average annual profit of mine owners in the better periods of the coal industry before the war. Interest payment is the largest payment item in the British coal industry. This is a major reason why the British coal industry is losing money.
    The capitalists abandoned the mines with backward equipment and losses, but at the same time they received extremely generous compensation, which of course greatly benefited them in carrying out other activities and investing in more profitable enterprises. For example, the large-scale Cory Brothers Coal Company invested part of the compensation it received in the oil industry. In this way, coal industry capitalists strengthened capitalist enterprises through nationalization measures, thereby obtaining greater profits. At the same time, because the state used taxpayers' money to update coal mine equipment and expand coal production, this relieved the serious coal shortage to a certain extent, so that capitalists in other industrial sectors also shared the benefits and obtained cheap raw material supplies. This is the "achievement" of the Labour Party's implementation of nationalization.
    On the other hand, after coal industry nationalization, the situation of workers working in "state-owned" mines is no different from that in private factories. The relationship between coal miners and the Coal Industry Administration is still a labor-capital relationship, and the exploitation they suffer has not been reduced in the slightest. Working conditions for British coal miners are still very harsh, and industrial accidents are common. Rising prices have offset wage increases. At present, the basic wage for underground miners is £9.10s per week, and the basic wage for surface miners is £8.10s per week. However, the well-fed gentlemen of the Coal Industry Administration have annual salaries as high as £10,000.
    It can be seen from this that the coal industry nationalization measures in Britain have not harmed the position of monopoly capital in the slightest. On the contrary, it is a means for monopoly capital to pursue huge profits and strengthen the exploitation of working people. From this fact, people can clearly see how absurd it is for modern revisionists to insist that the state machine of monopoly capital does not serve monopoly capital, but is above class, and that its intervention will reduce the economic power base of monopoly capital.

　　这种“国有化”为谁服务？
　　乐山
    5月14日，英国煤炭工业管理局——负责管理国有化煤炭企业的机构负责人鲍曼爵士在伦敦举行了记者招待会，就这个局发表的1957年英国煤炭工业情况报告作了说明。鲍曼指出，1957年英国煤炭工业管理局亏空达五百三十万英镑之多，估计1958年亏损数字将有过之无不及。
    可是，在这次记者招待会不久前，英国工党还出版了一个题名为“成功的故事”的小册子，吹嘘英国煤炭工业、民用航空、交通运输、电力、煤气事业采取国有化措施以来的种种成绩。
    让我们看看，英国工党所谓煤炭工业国有化的“成绩”意味着什么。
    由于采煤方法落后，设备陈旧，英国煤炭工业曾经长期陷入萧条状态。英国垄断资本的利益需要对矿井进行改组，重新装备，但是煤矿资本家却有另一套想法，裹足不前。英国工业家联合会早就提出过由国家出钱重新装备矿井的主张。1938年，保守党也提出过所谓由国家赎买煤矿的办法。
    第二次大战后，煤矿主曾把一些无利可图的矿井关闭，这使得英国处于严重的煤荒中。据估计，当时英国一年要缺煤五百万吨。由于缺煤，以煤作燃料的工业就无法开工或则非常困难。这一方面影响了英国在资本主义世界市场上的竞争力量；另一方面，国内的大批失业势必使得工人阶级和资产阶级间的矛盾尖锐化。如何恢复煤矿工业，因而加强英国的资本主义经济，成了当时英国一个关键性的问题。1945年工党上台以后，决定于1947年1月1日起实行煤炭工业国有化。这个决定完全符合垄断资本的利益，因而受到了资本家尤其是矿业家联合会热烈的欢迎。1951年，保守党上台以后，煤炭工业国有化的措施基本上没有什么改变。
    煤炭工业国有化开始实行的时候，英国煤炭工业管理局原来宣布对矿井主的货币赔偿总额为一亿六千四百六十六万英镑，后来增加到三亿五千三百三十万英镑，最后竟增为四亿英镑。货币赔偿总额一再增加当然非常有利于矿井主。不过，这事并不奇怪，因为当时的煤炭工业管理局的主要负责人都是矿井主。
    按照规定，赔偿费于五十年以内偿清。在偿清以前，矿井主每年凭债券支取利息。原定的2.5％的利息，也由他们自行提高到3.5％了。
    据英国“劳工研究”杂志报道，英国煤炭工业管理局每年应付出的利息为二千七百九十八万八千英镑，其中一千六百六十万零七千英镑为付给矿井主的债券利息，其余的是扩充设备的借款的利息。矿井主每年凭债券收入的利息，已经超过战前煤炭工业情况较好时期矿井主每年所得平均利润的一倍。利息支付是英国煤炭工业最大的支付项目。英国煤炭工业所以亏损这是一个主要原因。
    资本家把设备落后的、亏本的矿井丢开了，但是他们同时却获得了极为优厚的补偿，这当然大大有利于他们进行其他活动，投资在获利更为迅速的企业。例如，规模宏大的科利兄弟煤矿公司就把所得的部分赔偿金投入了石油业。这样，煤炭工业资本家通过国有化的措施，加强了资本主义企业，从而获取更大的利润。同时，由于国家用纳税人的钱更新了煤矿的设备，扩大了煤的生产，这就在一定程度上解除了严重的煤荒，使其他工业部门的资本家也分享利益，获得了廉价的原料供应。这就是英国工党实施国有化的“成绩”。
    在另一方面，煤炭工业国有化以后，在“国有”矿厂工作的工人处境同私营工厂并无区别。煤矿工人与煤炭工业管理局的关系仍是劳资的关系，他们所受的剥削并未稍减。英国煤矿工人工作条件仍然十分恶劣，工伤事故时有所闻。物价的上涨抵销了工资的增加。目前，地下操作的矿工基本工资每周九英镑十先令，地面操作的矿工基本工资每周八英镑十先令。而养尊处优的煤炭工业管理局的先生们有的年薪竟高达一万英镑之巨。
    由此可见，英国煤炭工业国有化的措施丝毫没有损害垄断资本的地位，相反地，它是垄断资本追求巨额利润和加强对劳动人民剥削的一种手段。从这个事实中，人们可以清楚地看到，现代修正主义者硬说垄断资本的国家机器并不为垄断资本服务，而是超阶级的，它的干涉会缩小垄断资本经济力量的基础，这是何等的荒谬。
