    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 29th: According to a report in the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Japanese Economic Planning Agency announced that the Japanese economy continued to be mired in stagnation in the past month.
    The Economic Planning Agency's report stated that Japan's import and export trade remains sluggish, and there is no hope for a substantial increase in domestic consumption; although the official interest rate on loans to private enterprises has been lowered, this measure cannot directly help to promote industrial and commercial activities.
    According to Kyodo News, the Japan Textile Association decided on the 27th to purchase 50 million square yards of cotton cloth from manufacturers' inventories to cope with the crisis facing the textile industry. At present, the total amount of cotton cloth in the inventories of textile manufacturers is 200 million square yards. If the situation of cotton cloth transactions does not improve, the amount of future purchases will increase.
    Meanwhile, Osaka cotton textile industry figures believe that due to the bleak prospects for domestic demand and exports, their 30% production cut measures will continue until the end of March next year.

    国内外市场前景暗淡
    日本经济继续停滞
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：据“日本经济新闻”报道，日本经济企划厅发表报告说，在过去一个月中，日本经济继续陷于停滞状态。
    经济企划厅的报告说，日本的进出口贸易继续处于呆滞状态，而国内消费也没有大量增加的希望；虽然降低了对私人企业贷款的官定利率，但是这一措施对于促进工商业活动也不能直接有所帮助。
    据共同社报道，日本纺织协会27日决定收购制造商库存的棉布五千万平方码，以应付纺织工业面临的危机。目前，各纺织业制造商库存的棉布共达二亿平方码。如果棉布交易情况还不能好转，那末将来的收购额还会增加。
    同时，大阪棉纺织业界人士认为，由于国内需求和出口的前景暗淡，他们采取的减产30％的措施还要继续到明年3月底。
