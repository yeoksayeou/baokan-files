Peat can be used to produce ammonium sulfate, according to successful experiments conducted by the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The available phosphorus and potassium fertilizer components in peat are significantly increased through dry distillation. Based on one ton of peat, the available phosphorus after manufacturing increases by 8.3 times compared to before manufacturing, and available potassium increases by 1.1 times. During the processing, a certain amount of biogas and distillate oil are also produced. The Ministry of Agriculture, in order to study this new problem of comprehensive utilization of peat, held a forum with chemical departments and agricultural scientific research departments to exchange opinions. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Beijing Second Bureau of Industry further studied this method after the meeting. The Beijing Second Bureau of Industry also conducted experiments in this area.

    泥炭能制硫酸铵
    本报讯　用泥炭干馏制造硫酸铵，已经由黑龙江农业科学研究所试验成功。泥炭的磷、钾速效肥分通过干馏大大地增加了。用一吨草炭计算，制造后的速效磷比制造前增加八点三倍、速效钾增加一点一倍。在加工过程中，同时还产生一定数量的沼气和馏油等。农业部为了研究这个综合利用泥炭的新问题，曾和化工部门、农业科学研究部门举行座谈交换意见。化工部和北京市第二工业局并在会后进一步研究了这一办法。北京市第二工业局还进行了这一方的试验。
