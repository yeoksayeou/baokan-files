To do the most admirable things is to be worthy of being the most admirable people. During my visit to a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) army that was about to return to the country, I discovered this heroic fighting spirit everywhere. It is like a red flag flying in the wind, standing on the frontier of defending peace in the East, inspiring the CPV officers and soldiers to advance victoriously again and again.

When I arrived at this CPV unit, from the unit leaders to the soldiers, everyone was busily preparing to withdraw from Korea. The Korean People's Army and other delegations came to the unit's station in batches to bid farewell. The song and dance performances of the Chinese and Korean military and civilians often lasted until late at night, and it was difficult to say goodbye.

On the eve of their triumphant return to the motherland, the officers and soldiers of this unit felt particularly proud that they had participated in the famous Battle of Kumsong five years ago. This was the last battle that forced the American aggressors to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. In this battle, this unit formed several arrowheads, plunged deeply into the enemy's depth, captured large areas of heavily fortified positions, and then fought hard for nine days and ten nights, bravely repelling the frantic counterattacks of the numerically superior enemy, ensuring the newly occupied positions, and wiping out 7,662 enemies.

The victorious Battle of Kumsong added honor to this CPV unit and also set an example for the most admirable people to do the most admirable things. Since the Korean Armistice Agreement was realized five years ago, this fighting style has run through the various tasks performed by this unit and has taken deep root in the hearts of every officer and soldier.

On the land of Korea, they are both defenders and builders. A few days ago, thousands of officers and soldiers who participated in the construction of the Chongju-China Friendship Reservoir returned from the construction site. Since February 20th of this year, this unit has invested nearly 130,000 workdays in this reservoir project, completing more than 50% of the entire project. In the initial stage of construction, CPV officers and soldiers drank liquor in their stomachs and rubbed it on their legs, working hard day and night in ice water at eight degrees below zero. Many people had red and swollen shoulders bleeding, blisters all over their hands, or became ill due to overwork. They still fought tirelessly with the heroic spirit of defending their positions in those years, and persisted until the eve of the unit's withdrawal from the construction site before returning to the country.

This is just one of the countless glorious examples of the CPV units supporting the Korean people's production labor over the years. As early as May 1953, before the Battle of Kumsong, the American aggressors frantically bombed water conservancy facilities in various parts of Korea in an attempt to sabotage the spring plowing production of the Korean people. The unit, which was in the midst of intense combat readiness work, dispatched more than 3,000 people to participate in the restoration of the Seogam, Limwon, and Maram reservoirs that had been bombed. After the armistice, the smoke and dust of battle on the officers and soldiers had not yet disappeared, and they immediately devoted themselves to another battle to help the local Korean people rebuild their homes. In Changdo-eup, which had become a ruin, elementary and secondary school buildings and one hospital and one cinema were built. The Changdo County Government specially built an Anti-US and Aid Korea architectural memorial tower in the local area to thank the CPV units.

The heroic deeds of the CPV officers and soldiers in peaceful labor remind people of a young messenger's bold words during the Battle of Kumsong. This young messenger was named Su Jun. He and a platoon were holding a newly occupied hilltop. The enemy launched many counterattacks under fierce artillery fire, but they were all repelled. However, in the fierce battle, only a few people were left in the platoon, including Su Jun, who was wounded. At the critical moment, this young messenger said this: On this hilltop, we are the representatives of the peace and democracy camp, and we must defeat the enemy. Su Jun and his comrades became victors. Nothing could better illustrate how proletarian internationalism becomes a source of strength than his words.

In the Battle of Kumsong, there were even more moving heroic deeds than this. Ma Junkun, the second platoon leader of a certain regiment of this unit, was wounded three times while leading the soldiers of the entire platoon in holding a newly occupied position, but he still firmly directed the soldiers to repel the enemy's twelve counterattacks. Later, his legs were broken by the enemy's artillery fire, but he still continued to crawl around on the position to direct the battle with extraordinary bravery and perseverance, and repelled the enemy's seven counterattacks. In the final moment, he detonated the last grenade and died together with the enemies who rushed to the top of the hill. There were eight or nine heroes like Platoon Leader Ma Junkun in this regiment. The vows of those heroes who were seriously injured and resolutely refused to leave the front line were: As long as the heart does not stop beating, they can fight until they do not see the enemy's corpses spread all over the front of the position before leaving the position.

After the realization of the armistice, in order to strengthen the forces for defending peace, the CPV units have also displayed the heroic qualities of resourcefulness and bravery in the Battle of Kumsong in the tense military training over the past few years, and have achieved brilliant victories. And in daily life, they continue to maintain a hard and simple style. They built barracks by themselves on barren hillsides. In addition to cement and wood supplied by the motherland, they burned bricks and tiles, burned lime, and made adobe themselves, and made angle iron from waste iron such as gasoline drums and bomb casings; they truly did not move a single blade of grass or a tree in Korea. In order to reduce the burden on the people of the motherland, from generals to soldiers, everyone started to cultivate wasteland and grow vegetables, and they also raised pigs themselves. In the past year, the vegetables they planted were enough for all officers and soldiers to eat for a whole year, and the pigs they raised could provide meat for more than three months. Together with grain, cooking coal, livestock feed, and office miscellaneous expenses, the annual savings could buy eight fighter jets.

These are the most admirable things that the heroes of the Anti-US and Aid Korea War have done. On the day the reporter arrived, it was the day when this unit was holding a meeting of young activists. After the meeting, I visited several of the representatives and asked them what they planned to do after returning to the country. Their unanimous answer was that under the shining light of the general line of building socialism in the motherland, they were determined to go to the most difficult and needed places to participate in the construction of the motherland and always maintain the honor of being the most admirable people. That is to say, after returning to the country, they will still hold high the red flag of communism and always maintain the most admirable style on the Korean battlefield.

    高举红旗回祖国
    新华社记者　周思义
    要做最可爱的事，才配成为最可爱的人。记者在即将归国的志愿军某部访问中，到处发现这种豪迈的战斗风格。它就像矗立在保卫东方和平前哨上的一杆迎风翻飞的红旗，激励着志愿军官兵们胜利的前进再前进。
    当我到达这支志愿军部队的时候，从部队首长到战士，都在紧张的进行撤离朝鲜的准备工作。朝鲜人民军和别的代表团一批又一批前来部队驻地依依话别。中朝军民的歌舞联欢，往往直到深夜还难分难舍。
    在凯旋归国前夕，这支部队的官兵，特别感到自豪的是五年前参加过著名的金城反击战，这是迫使美国侵略者在朝鲜停战协定上签字的最后一战，在这次战斗中，这支部队组成几个箭头，猛插敌人纵深，攻下了大片坚固设防的阵地，继而苦战九天十夜，奋勇击退了数量上占优势的疯狂反扑的敌人，确保了新占领的阵地，并歼敌七千六百六十二名。
    胜利的金城反击战给这支志愿军部队增添了荣誉，同时也为最可爱的人作最可爱的事，树立了榜样。从朝鲜停战实现以后的五年来，这种战斗风格，贯穿在这支部队所执行的各项任务中，深深扎根在每个官兵的心坎上。
    他们在朝鲜的土地上，既是保卫者又是建设者。几天以前，参加修建定州朝中友谊水库的成千名官兵，才从工地回来。这支部队从今年2月20日开始，先后在这个水库工程中，投入了近十三万个劳动日，完成了全部工程的50％以上。施工初期，志愿军官兵们把烧酒喝在肚里，擦在腿上，在零下八度的冰水里，昼夜不停地艰苦劳动。许多人两个肩膀都红肿出血，手上磨满了水泡，或者是因过度劳累得了病，仍然用他们当年坚守阵地的英雄气概，奋战不息，一直坚持到部队回国前夕撤离工地为止。
    这只是志愿军部队连年来支援朝鲜人民生产劳动的无数光荣事例之一。远在金城反击战之前的1953年5月间，美国侵略者曾疯狂轰炸朝鲜各地水利设施，企图破坏朝鲜人民的春耕生产。正处在紧张备战工作中的部队，先后出动了三千多人，参加修复石岩、林源、马岚三个被炸毁的水库。停战以后，官兵们身上战斗的烟尘还没有消失，又立即投入帮助驻地朝鲜人民重建家园的另一种战斗。单是在已成为一片废墟的昌道邑，就盖起中小学校舍各一处，医院一所，电影院一所。昌道郡政府为了感谢志愿军部队，特地在当地建立了一座抗美援朝建筑纪念塔。
    志愿军官兵们在和平劳动中的英雄业绩，使人联想起金城反击战时一个小通讯员的豪语。这个小通讯员名叫苏俊，他同一个排一起扼守在一座新占领的山头上，敌人在猛烈炮火协同下，多次反扑都被打下去了，可是在剧烈战斗中这个排也打剩了寥寥几个人，其中，有负了伤的苏俊。这个年青的通讯员，在危急万分的时刻，说出了这样的话：在这个山头上我们就是和平民主阵营的代表，一定要战胜敌人。苏俊和他的战友，果然成了胜利者。再没有比他的话能更好地说明无产阶级国际主义如何成为力量的源泉。
    在金城反击战中，还有比这更动人的英雄事迹。这支部队所属某团二排长麻俊坤在率领全排战士在坚守一处新占领的阵地时三次负伤，还是坚定地指挥战士们先后打退了敌人十二次反扑。后来，他的两腿又被敌人的炮火打断了，而他仍然以非凡的勇敢和毅力，继续在阵地上爬来爬去指挥战斗，又打退敌人七次反扑。在最后的时刻，他拉响了最后一颗手雷和冲上山头的敌人同归于尽。像麻俊坤排长这样的英雄，在这个团里，就有八、九个人。那些身负重伤，坚决不下火线的英雄们的誓言是：只要心脏不停止跳动，就能战斗到不看到敌人的尸体铺满阵地前沿也不下阵地。
    停战实现以后，志愿军部队为了加强保卫和平的力量，几年来在紧张的军事训练中也发挥了金城反击战中智勇双全的英雄本色，取得了光辉的胜利。并且在日常生活中，继续保持着坚苦朴素的作风。他们在荒山坡上自己动手建筑营房。建筑材料除了水泥木材等由祖国供应外，他们自己烧砖瓦烧石灰作土坯，用汽油桶和炸弹壳等废铁制成三角铁；真正的作到了不动朝鲜的一草一木。为了要减轻祖国人民的负担，从将军到士兵人人动手开荒种菜，还自己养了猪。在去年一年中，他们种植的蔬菜就够全体官兵整整吃一年，所饲养的猪可以自给肉食三个月以上，连同粮食、炊事用煤、牲口饲料和办公杂支费用等，全年节约所得可以购买战斗机八架。
    这些就是抗美援朝的英雄所作所为的最可爱的事。在记者到达的一天，正是这支部队在召开青年积极分子大会。会后，我访问了其中的几个代表，并问他们归国以后准备干些什么？他们的一致回答是在祖国建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，决心到最艰苦最需要他们的地方去参加祖国建设事业，永远保持最可爱的人的荣誉。这就是说，他们在回国以后，仍将高高地举起共产主义的红旗，永远保持在朝鲜战场上的最可爱的风格。
