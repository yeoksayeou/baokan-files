　　Never Crippled Hearts, A Visit to People Who Are Never Crippled - Extracurricular Performance Team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium
　　By our reporter Wang Zhuofei
    "On the battlefield, we used bayonets to cleave the enemy, and even crippled, we are still fearless soldiers." This is the bold statement of the disabled soldiers of the Extracurricular Performance Team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium, who are currently performing in Beijing, and it is also their guiding principle for action.
    They also sing at the top of their voices:
    We have a strong will,
    We have a heart that will never be crippled,
    We read newspapers and books even without eyes,
    We write and play instruments even without hands,
    Paralyzed legs can work with our hands,
    Even without feet, we can rush and sprint.
    Difficulties only exist for the weak,
    They cannot stop soldiers who have been trained for a long time.
    What a great song! What a moving poem! It shows the high degree of revolutionary optimism of this group of disabled soldiers.
    In this heroic performance team, people have personally seen those people who are praised in the song. They are disabled, but they are still fearless soldiers.
    As long as there is a strong will, you can write and play instruments even without hands.
    Zhang Jiachen lost both hands in a training exercise due to an explosion. How can you write without hands? At first, he asked others to tie the pen to his slender, flat stump with a rope, but this was very troublesome. Every time he wrote, he had to ask others to help tie the pen. Sometimes, when he wanted to write something at night, he couldn't find anyone to help.
    "I want to live and work independently, I want to find a trick to overcome my disability." He made this vow. He designed a tool to help disabled people write based on his own needs. After several days and nights of hard thinking and experimentation, his ideal was realized. This tool is a circular steel sleeve with a small steel clip on it, like an office iron clip. The steel sleeve is placed on the disabled wrist, and the pen is clamped in the small steel clip on the steel sleeve. In this way, you can put the pen in the steel clip yourself without anyone's help and use it freely to write. Now, Zhang Jiachen uses this tool to write, he can write long articles, and he can also take meeting minutes. Every word can be written in the grid and written very neatly.
    After Zhang Jiachen became disabled, in addition to learning to write, he also learned many things, such as playing the harmonica, playing table tennis, etc. He has very high requirements for learning, and he wants to learn another skill after learning one. When he saw many disabled soldiers learning music, he also wanted to learn to use an instrument. He had a strong interest in the harmonium, so he used his stumps to tap the white and black keys on the harmonium in his spare time every day. When he started playing, the tones could not be connected continuously, and he could not play fast tunes. The comrades all encouraged him, but some people said, "It's really a miracle to play the harmonium without hands. There are probably too many difficulties!" Zhang Jiachen was not discouraged when he heard these words, and he continued to learn with confidence. He said that as long as his heart is not crippled, he will definitely be able to learn what he wants to learn. He stayed with the harmonium every day. After a long time, his stumps could press out simple musical phrases on the black keys, and his arms became more flexible, and he was finally able to play ordinary tunes. At this time, he used various opportunities to learn to play the harmonium, actively participated in dances to provide musical accompaniment, and had fun with workers and students. After about a year or so, Zhang Jiachen was able to play the harmonium relatively skillfully. The songs he played on the stage, such as "I Love My Motherland" and "Assembly Call," were warmly welcomed by the audience.
    Zhang Jiachen has even higher aspirations. Because he now plays mostly tunes without semitones. He wants to find a way to modify the harmonium to make it suitable for his own needs and at his command. He said that the socialist building needs steel, and we disabled people are willing to be small screws. I want to be a music teacher in the sanatorium and do something for the country.
    Difficulties cannot stop soldiers who have been trained for a long time, and a one-handed person has learned to play the flute.
    When Yi Ruyuan arrived in Beijing, he asked everyone he met: Are there any one-handed flute players in Beijing? I want to learn advanced experience. He also asked the reporter this question. He told the reporter that he had been asking around, trying to find a one-handed flute-playing companion, but he couldn't find one. Sometimes he met them in his dreams, but when he woke up, it was just a dream. It's really frustrating.
    One-handed flute players are rare. People understand Yi Ruyuan's eagerness to find a companion, because there are indeed many difficulties in playing the flute with one hand.
    Yi Ruyuan was originally a soldier in an anti-aircraft machine gun company of the Volunteer Army. He was injured in 1953 and lost his left hand, lost sight in his right eye, and had only 60% vision in his left eye. Despite this, he was not pessimistic or disappointed. In the sanatorium, he actively participated in recreational activities and was determined to learn to play the flute. At first, he held the flute with one hand, and the flute often fell to the ground. Moreover, when he played, he could only play the notes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and the notes 4 and 7 could not be played. What to do? His method was to study hard and practice hard. He played in the morning, played in the evening, and played whenever he had time. Finally, he held the flute firmly and was able to play the tune of "The East is Red." But at this time, the notes 4 and 7 still could not be played. So he studied how to use the five fingers on one hand and use the stump without a hand to help, and the problem was solved. He asked a student from the Conservatory of Music to manufacture a flute based on his ideas. This flute met his requirements, and he could play all the notes.
    Because his thumb on one hand was also injured and not flexible, he used a rope to put the flute on his hand and put one end of the flute on his shoulder when playing. With the flute firmly in place, he played boldly and to his heart's content, and the notes he played were more accurate.
    After about three years of diligent study and hard practice, he can now play ordinary tunes. His one faintly visible eye can only read for a few minutes each time, but he seems to have forgotten this pain and actively recognizes musical scores to improve his flute playing skills. He also has a plan: to design another flute to facilitate better performance and be a vanguard in the socialist propaganda team.
    Legs are crippled, but the heart is not crippled. If you can't dance for the soldiers, then sing for the soldiers.
    During each performance, people can see a young girl with paralyzed lower limbs singing Sichuan folk songs on the stage with two crutches. This girl's name is He Changjun. She was originally a member of the army's cultural troupe and was a skilled dancer. The dances she performed were enthusiastically welcomed by the frontier soldiers. During a forced march, she fell off a cliff and broke her legs. She then stayed in the hospital for more than two years.
    Paralyzed lower limbs, unable to dance for the frontier soldiers, He Changjun was a little depressed. But she asked herself: Are my legs crippled, or is my heart also crippled? Her answer was: No! If I can't dance for the soldiers, then I'll sing for the soldiers. What's so depressing about that? From then on, she became happy and practiced singing every day. The Sichuan folk songs she sang were welcomed by the disabled soldiers. The Sichuan folk song "A Group of Real People" written by disabled soldiers with paralyzed lower limbs praised He Changjun. One section of this folk song goes like this:
    There is a He Changjun in the paralysis class, this girl is young,
    She is skilled in performing dances in the army, and is welcomed everywhere.
    After being injured and becoming paralyzed, she had no energy. How could she practice dancing?
    "If I don't practice dancing, I will sing. My voice is good, and I can always sing!"
    From then on, she "stretched her mouth" every day, and songs like "Socialism is Good!" rose into the clouds.
    The eyes are blind, but the heart is bright. They will always happily sing for socialism.
    In this performance team, some people are disabled soldiers who are blind in both eyes. They are in the chorus performance, they are in the accompaniment of male and female chorus, and they are in the ensemble of national musical instruments. They also organized an accordion ensemble. Xu Houxian, a young man who is blind in one eye and has faint vision in the other, is a multi-talented young man who can sing and dance. The white film on his one faintly visible eye is very heavy, and the time is not far away when he will be completely blind. However, he is still very happy. He told reporters that as long as he can still see a little light, he will have to sing and dance like someone with two eyes. He has made preparations for complete blindness, actively learning Braille, so that he can work for the Party in the same way after being completely blind. Now he has learned to read and write letters by touch. He also said that in the near future, his eyes may not be able to see the brilliance of the general line of socialist construction, but his heart has been illuminated transparently by the brilliance of the general line. He will work more happily and be a person who will never be crippled.
    In this heroic performance team, there are also the quick-board performer, Du Shuangquan, who had his right hand and right foot amputated; the male solo singer, Gou Zhongyu, who had both hands amputated; Huang Tianran, who uses the stumps of his amputated hands to hold table tennis rackets and perform table tennis; and Yang Daxin, a car skills performer who can ride a bicycle for long distances and can ring the bell and brake despite having both hands amputated.
    "Your heroic revolutionary optimism will inspire the 600 million Chinese people to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results."
    The leaders of the Party and the country praised them after watching their performances. Premier Zhou praised them as "people's soldiers and people's artists." Vice Premier Peng Dehuai praised them, saying: "Your heroic revolutionary optimism will inspire the 600 million Chinese people to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and will educate millions of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers to better defend the socialist construction of the motherland. Your patriotism and internationalism will spread all over the world. Your blood and sweat have not been shed in vain, you have watered the great flower of socialism of the Chinese people."
    The performances of the disabled soldiers in Beijing were also warmly welcomed by the audience. The audience was moved to tears after watching their performances. People couldn't help but reflect and ask themselves: If disabled people are like this, can people with hands, feet, and eyes be inferior to them? Their communist style is becoming a model for people to learn from, and their revolutionary optimism is inspiring people to move forward. (Attached pictures)

　　永不残废的心，永不残废的人访
    四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队
　　本报记者　王濯非
    “战场上我们用刺刀劈过敌人，残废了我们仍是无畏的士兵”。这是正在北京演出的四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队的残废军人们的豪言壮语，也是他们的行动指针。
    他们还敞开嗓子歌唱：
    我们有坚强的意志，
    我们有颗永不残废的心，
    没有眼睛照样读书看报，
    没有双手一样写字弹琴，
    两腿瘫痪能用双手劳动，
    没有双脚也能急走飞奔。
    困难只能在软弱者面前存在，
    挡不住久经锻炼的士兵。
    这是多么伟大的歌唱！这是多么动人的诗篇！它显示出这一批残废军人的高度的革命乐观主义的精神。
    在这支英雄的演出队中，人们亲眼看到了像歌唱中所歌颂的那一些人，他们是残废了，但仍然是无畏的士兵。
    只要有坚强的意志，没有双手也能写字弹琴。
    张家琛是在一次练兵运动中由于炸药爆炸而失去双手的。没有双手怎么写字呢？开始，他请别人用绳子把笔绑在他的细扁的残肢上写字，可是这样很麻烦，每次写字都要找别人帮助绑笔，有时在夜里想写点东西，也找不到人帮忙。
    “我要独立生活和工作，我要找窍门战胜残废”。他立下了这个志愿。他就根据自己的需要，设计一种帮助残废人写字的工具。经过几昼夜的苦思和试验，他的理想实现了。这种工具是圆形的钢套，钢套上还有一个像办公用的铁夹子一样的小钢夹。钢套套在残废的手腕上，笔就夹在钢套上的小钢夹中。这样就可以不要人帮忙自己把笔夹在钢夹中，运用自如地写字。现在张家琛用这种工具写字，可以写长篇文章，也可以作会议纪录，每个字都可以写在格子里面，并写得很端正。
    张家琛残废了以后，除了学会写字以外，还学会了很多东西，如吹口琴、打乒乓球等。他学习的要求是很高的，学会了一样就想再学一样。他见到许多残废军人学音乐，他也想学会使用一种乐器。他对风琴有浓厚的兴趣，于是他就天天在课余时间用残肢去敲打风琴上的白键和黑键。开始弹的时候，音调连续不起来，遇到快的调子也弹不出来。同志们都鼓励他，但也有人说，“没有双手也能弹风琴，真是奇事。困难恐怕是太多了！”张家琛听到了这些话，没有气馁，还是满怀信心地学下去。他说，只要心没有残废，自己想学的东西一定能够学会。他天天不离开风琴，日子久了，他的残肢能在黑键上按出简单的乐句，胳膊也灵活起来，终于能弹出一般的曲子。这时，他就利用各种机会学习弹风琴，积极参加舞会作音乐伴奏，同工人、学生联欢。大约经过了一年多的时间，张家琛已经能够比较熟练地弹风琴了。他在舞台上演奏的“我爱我的祖国”、“进军号”等歌曲，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    张家琛还有更高的愿望。因为他现在弹的多是没有半音的曲子。他要设法改装风琴，使风琴适合自己的需要，听自己使唤。他说，社会主义大厦需要钢材，我们残废的人愿意做一个小小的螺丝钉，我想在教养院里当音乐教员，为国家做一点事情。
    困难挡不住久经锻炼的士兵，一只手的人学会了奏笛。
    易如元到了北京，逢人便问：北京有独手吹笛子的人吗？我想学习先进经验。见到了记者，他也这样问。他对记者说，我到处打听，想找个独手吹笛的同伴，就是找不到。有时在梦中遇见了，醒来却是一场空。真叫人发急。
    独手吹笛的人是少有的。人们对易如元急于寻找同伴的迫切心情是理解的，因为独手吹笛确有很多困难。
    易如元原是志愿军一个高射机枪连的战士，1953年负伤，失去了左手，右眼失明，左眼只有60％的视度。尽管这样，他不悲观，也不失望，在教养院里，积极参加文娱活动，并下决心要学会吹笛子。开始，他一只手拿着笛子吹，笛子时常掉在地上，而且在吹的时候，只能吹1、2、3、5、6的音，4、7的音吹不出来。怎么办呢？他的办法是多学苦练，早上吹，晚上吹，有空就吹，终于把笛子拿稳，并能吹出东方红的调子。但这时，4、7的音还是吹不出来。于是他就研究怎样能利用一只手上的五个手指，并且用没有手的残肢来帮忙，问题就好解决了。他请了一位音乐学院的学生，根据他的意见制造出一种笛子。这种笛子满足了他的要求，他可以把所有的音都吹出来了。
    由于他的一只手上的大母指也受过伤，用起来不灵活，在演奏的时候，他就用绳子把笛子套在手上，并把笛子的一端放在肩上。笛子放得牢稳了，他就大胆的吹，尽情的吹，吹出的音也就更加正确。
    经过约有三年时间的勤学苦练，他现在能吹一般的调子了。他的一目微光的眼睛，每次看书只能看几分钟，但他好像忘记了这个痛苦一样，积极识乐谱，提高吹笛的技能。他还有一个打算：再设计一种笛子，便于更好地演奏，做一个社会主义宣传队伍中的尖兵。
    腿残废了心没有残废，不能为战士跳舞，就为战士歌唱。
    每次演出时，人们都可以看到一个扶着两个拐杖的下肢瘫痪的年轻姑娘在舞台上歌唱四川民歌，这位姑娘的名字叫何长俊，原是部队文工团员，是个跳舞能手。她跳的舞受到边疆战士的热情欢迎。在一次急行军中，她摔到崖下，跌坏了两条腿，以后在医院里住了两年多。
    下肢瘫痪，不能跳舞给边疆战士看了，何长俊有些苦闷。但她向自己问道：腿残废了，心难道也残废了吗？她的回答是：没有！不能跳舞给战士看，就唱歌给战士听，有什么好苦闷的呢？从此，她愉快起来，天天练习唱歌。她唱的四川民歌，受到残废军人的欢迎。下肢瘫痪的残废军人写的“一群真正的人”的四川小调中就表扬了何长俊。这首小调有一段是这样的：
    瘫痪班有个何长俊，这个姑娘年纪轻，
    在部队表演舞蹈有本领，到处受到人欢迎。
    负伤后成瘫痪浑身没劲，要练习舞蹈怎能行？
    “不练舞蹈我把歌唱，嗓子好，唱歌总能行”！
    从此天天“展嘴劲”，“社会主义好！”的歌唱入云。
    双目失明了，但心是亮堂的。他们永远愉快地为社会主义歌唱。
    在这支演出队里有一些人是双目失明的残废军人。在大合唱的演出中有他们，在男女合唱的伴奏中有他们，民族乐器合奏中有他们。他们还组织了一个手风琴合奏队。一目失明、一目微光的残废军人徐厚贤是个多才多艺的小伙子，能歌善舞。他的一目微光的眼睛，白膜很重，离完全失明的时间已经不远了。可是，他依然很愉快。他对记者说，只要还能看到一点光，我还得像有两只眼睛的人一样唱歌和跳舞。他已做了双目完全失明的准备，积极学习盲文，可以在完全失明后一样地为党工作。现在他已学会了摸书和写信。他还说，在不久的将来，我的眼睛可能看不到社会主义建设总路线的光辉，可是我的心已被总路线的光辉照得透明，我要更加愉快地工作下去，做一个永不残废的人。
    在这支英雄的演出队中，还有快板演唱者、切去右手右足的杜双全，男声独唱、切去双手的苟中玉，用切去双手的残肢抱着乒乓球的拍子表演乒乓球的黄天然，切去双手能够长途骑自行车并能按铃和刹车的车技表演者杨达信。
    “你们的英雄的革命乐观主义精神，将鼓舞中国六亿人民多快好省地建设社会主义”
    党和国家的领导人看了他们的表演后，都称赞他们。周总理称赞他们是“人民的战士、人民的艺术家”。彭德怀副总理赞扬他们说：“你们的英雄的革命乐观主义精神，将鼓舞中国六亿人民多快好省地建设社会主义，将教育几百万中国人民解放军更好地保卫祖国的社会主义建设事业。你们的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神，将奔放全世界。你们的血和汗是没有白流的，你们浇成了中国人民社会主义的伟大花朵。”
    残废军人在北京的演出还受到观众的热烈欢迎。观众们在看了他们的演出后，感动得流了眼泪。人们不禁反省自问：残废的人尚且如此，有手、有脚、有眼睛的人难道还能不如他们吗？他们的共产主义风格，正成为人们的学习榜样，他们的革命乐观主义精神，正鼓舞着人们前进。（附图片）
