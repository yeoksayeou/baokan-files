Xinhua News Agency, 15th: To adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, China will accelerate the pace of railway electrification. The electrification railway experimental field—the Baoji-Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—is ready for all tasks and is about to start construction. The Fengtai-Shacheng line and the Beijing East Suburb circular test line will also start construction this winter and next spring. China's railways have determined to adopt the world's most advanced technical standard—single-phase AC 50 Hz 25 kV high voltage—as the standard system for electrification.

In recent months, the railway electrification plan has been revised repeatedly with the ideological leap forward and changes in objective conditions. At the end of last year, it was only planned to carry out some pilot work on three lines: the Baoji-Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Fengtai to Shacheng, and Taiyuan to Su County on the Beitongpu line. By March of this year, several lines had been added, more than three times the original plan. Recently, the Ministry of Railways is drafting a fifteen-year railway electrification development plan. According to this plan, the pace of progress will be even faster.

The acceleration of railway electrification is closely related to the national Great Leap Forward in production. Since April and May, the results of the Great Leap Forward in various aspects have gradually been reflected in transportation. The goods that various units requested to be shipped are increasing day by day and becoming more urgent day by day. Goods waiting for shipment at stations and in warehouses have become mountains and seas, so that various railway administrations report to the Ministry of Railways every day in alarm. Faced with this new situation, the railway department is both happy and worried. What is happy is that there are more goods, which shows that the production leap forward in various aspects is really fast. What is worrying is that the mouth is big, the belly is big, and the neck is thin. The more goods, the greater the pressure on transportation, and it is expected to be even more tense in the future.

According to the requirements of the objective situation of the national Great Leap Forward, and the characteristics of China's large area, many mountainous areas, and abundant hydropower resources, China's railways have decided that electrification will be the main direction of development in the future. There are many benefits to railway electrification. Electric locomotives have great power and endurance, and they are most suitable for use in places with large slopes, many tunnels, and large transportation volumes. Moreover, the larger the transportation volume, the better its economic effect. On general lines, the use of electric locomotives and "centralized dispatch" equipment can provide a transportation capacity equivalent to the construction of three parallel railways. The use of electric locomotives can save a lot of coal. An electric locomotive can save about 7,000 tons of coal per year compared to a steam locomotive (referring to thermal power generation; if hydropower generation is used, the savings are even greater). In terms of investment, electrification is much more economical than double-tracking. The investment in general electrified railways does not exceed 200,000 yuan per kilometer. If the Baotian, Baofeng, Taiyuan to Su County on the Beitongpu line, and Fengsha lines were double-tracked, the investment would be more than 500 million yuan, while electrification would only cost more than 200 million yuan. Electric locomotives are also more convenient and safer to manage. Railway management personnel can be reduced by about 20% to 25%, and transportation operating expenses can be reduced by about 40%.

The Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture has brought glorious and arduous transportation tasks to the transportation industry, and has also created favorable development conditions for transportation. Last year, some people doubted whether China could manufacture electric locomotives itself, whether it could design electrified railways itself, and whether the power supply could keep up. At that time, many people thought that railway electrification technology was too complicated and could not be done. There was even wavering in technical policies. In March of this year, the railway department formulated a Great Leap Forward plan, and it still felt that there were many difficulties. Recently, the situation has changed drastically. The electric locomotives that were originally thought to be impossible to manufacture have been jointly trial-produced by the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Railways; the power supply is basically not a problem; the preliminary design of the Baofeng Road, which was originally不敢动手 without expert guidance, has been completed. The design department will also complete the design tasks of all electrical railways within the second five-year plan ahead of schedule this year.

On a global scale, electrified railways have a history of eighty years. However, the railway electrification speed in many capitalist countries is not fast. Until now, the total length of electrified railways worldwide is only six or seven kilometers. The Soviet Union developed extremely rapidly after World War II. As of January 1 this year, it had 7,700 kilometers, becoming a country with a relatively large number of electrified railways in the world. Electrified railways in the United Kingdom now have less than 2,000 kilometers.

### 适应生产大跃进需要  铁路电气化建设速度加快

    适应生产大跃进需要
    铁路电气化建设速度加快
    新华社15日讯　我国将加快铁路电气化的速度。电气化铁路的试验田——宝成铁路宝鸡凤县段，各项准备工作都已就绪，即将动工兴建。今冬明春开工的还有丰台沙城线和北京东郊环形试验线。我国铁路已确定采用世界上最先进的技术标准——单相交流五十周波二万五千伏高电压作为电气化的标准制。
    近几个月来铁路电气化的计划随着思想跃进和客观条件的变化而一再修改。去年底还只打算在三条线路上进行一些试点工作，一条是宝成路的宝鸡凤县段、一条是丰台到沙城，一条是北同蒲线上的太原到宿县段。到今年3月，增加了若干线路，比原计划增加三倍以上。最近，铁道部正在拟定一个十五年铁路电气化发展规划。按照这个规划，前进速度将更快。
    铁路电气化速度加快和全国生产大跃进有密切关系。从4月和5月以来，各方面大跃进的结果逐渐反映到交通运输方面，各个单位要求托运的货物一天比一天多，一天比一天急。车站上、仓库里待运的货物成山成海，以致各铁路管理局每天向铁道部告急。面对这个新形势，铁路部门又是喜又是愁。喜的是货物多了，说明各方面生产跃进的真快。愁的是嘴大肚大脖子细。货物越多，对交通运输的压力越大，而且预计今后还将更加紧张。
    根据全国大跃进客观形势的要求，和我国地方大、山区多、水电资源丰富的特点，我国铁路决定今后将以电气化为发展的主要方向。铁路电气化的好处很多。电气机车力气又大又持久，它最适合用在山坡大隧道多和运输大的地方。而且运输量越大，它的经济效果越好。在一般线路上，采用电气机车和“调度集中”设备，运输能力相当于修三条平行的铁路。采用电气机车可以节省大量燃煤，一台电气机车每年大概可以比一台蒸汽机车节省七千吨煤（指火力发电，如水力发电，节省更大），在投资方面，电气化比修复线省得多。一般电气化铁路每公里投资不超过二十万元，宝天、宝凤、北同蒲线的太原到宿县、丰沙这四条线，若修复线，需投资五亿多元，电气化只要两亿多元就够了。电气机车在管理上也比较方便、安全。铁路管理人员大约可以减少20％到25％，运输营业费可以减少40％左右。
    工业农业大跃进为交通事业带来了光荣的繁重的运输任务，同时也为交通运输创造了有利的发展条件。去年还有些人怀疑我国是否能自制电气机车，是不是能自己设计电气化铁路，电力能不能供应得上。那时候许多人认为铁路电气化技术太复杂，搞不了。甚至在技术政策上也有摇摆。今年3月，铁路部门制定了一个跃进计划，还感到困难重重。近来，形势却大变了。原来以为自己不能制造的电气机车，已由第一机械工业部和铁道部合作试制；电力供应基本不成问题；原来没有专家指导就不敢动手的宝凤路初步设计已经完成。设计部门还要提前在今年内完成第二个五年计划期内全部电气铁路的设计任务。
    就全世界范围来说，电气化铁路已有八十年历史。不过许多资本主义国家铁路电气化速度并不快。直到现在，全世界电气化铁路总共只有六、七万公里。苏联在第二次世界大战后发展极快，到今年1月1日已有七千七百公里，成为世界上电气化铁路较多的国家。英国电气化铁路到现在不到二千公里。
