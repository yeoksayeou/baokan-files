    Long Live Labor
    ——Notes from the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Site
    By Our Reporter Fu Dong
    When the car arrived at Changping Station, I had a small argument with my companions. I said we should go north, around Da Hongmen to the reservoir headquarters. They laughed at me, saying the construction site had changed a lot, and I was using outdated information.
    Following their advice, we went northeast for a while, and a large area of houses appeared before us. This is Dagushan! I came here once in February this year. At that time, it was still a bare area! Now, high and low, left and right, are all tents and reed sheds, like a newly built city.
    I climbed to the top of the mountain at the eastern entrance and looked up, wow! Hanbao Mountain and Mang Mountain are connected by a newly built dam, more than a mile long and eight or nine stories high. This is the main project of the reservoir – the flood control dam.
    I wanted to go to the construction site to have a look. Coincidentally, Comrade Sun Ketao from the Organization Department was going to the construction site, so I went with him.
    We climbed up the mountain along the road on Hanbao Mountain. The entire construction site could be seen clearly. The construction site was full of people. More than a dozen belt conveyors were lying diagonally on the dam waist like dragons. On the dam, tamping machines were hammering up and down, and artillery vehicles were rolling back and forth with sheep’s foot rollers. Below the dam, trains and cars were dragging a long string of dump trucks on the small railway track. The last time I came, the dump trucks were still pushed by people. Each dump truck could hold one or two tons of soil, and it was really hard to push! I wonder who came up with the good idea? Sun Ketao said, "They are all soldiers! One locomotive can pull 150 tons of soil at once; the 'car heads' can pull up to 36 tons!" He paused for a moment, then pointed to a smoking locomotive in the middle and said, "I heard that it was a train given to Empress Dowager Cixi by France. Now we have pulled it out to serve socialism."
    We walked into a canvas tent. This is the on-site command post of the West Earth Section. The room was full of comrades from the army. They were busy making phone calls and directing the construction site, one call after another. A comrade named He Hua said, don't look down on the soldiers for not having much education, they are doing big things. One soldier invented a tipping machine. It used to take fifteen minutes to load a truck of soil, but with this thing, it takes only three seconds to load a truck. As he spoke, he led us out of the tent and pointed to a wooden bridge on the hillside to the west, saying, "This was thought up by a division commander of the army. Originally, there was no road on the mountain. When the dam was built to the height of seven stories, the cars were still carrying several buckets of soil straight up and down. The slope was too steep, so Deputy Division Commander Qiu Huihao pondered for a few days and built a bridge in mid-air in four days. It was tested and it was great, it could withstand a 15-ton car."
    On the labor team, the red flags were like fire. This flag was written with "Pioneer Brigade" and "Model Squad," that one was written with "Excellent Brigade" and "Advanced Group," and one flag was written with "Satellite Youth Shock Team." People said that this team was excellent. They had been awarded prizes four times at the construction site, and they were always among them. Their captain, Xu Shixiao, was even more of an iron man. A few days ago, he injured the bone on his thigh and was sent to the hospital. He only rested for two days before going back to work.
    Walking to the east dam, we saw several people transporting materials next to a funnel that was taller than a person. The appearance of this funnel was very interesting. It looked like pants folded from paper by a small child. The sand and stones transported by the belt conveyor were pouring into the funnel, and then flowing from the funnel into the soil baskets. People at the construction site told me a story: After these dozens of belt conveyors were transported to the construction site from various schools and agencies, they solved the problem greatly, and there was no need for thousands upon thousands of people to carry sand and stone to the dam. But there was one thing that was not good. The sand and stone were ejected too quickly and violently, and it was easy to hurt people. Besides, there was no time to load them. Everyone was holding back their energy, saying that they had to put a bridle on these dragon mouths. They thought about it and came up with this funnel. Now these dragons are all obedient, and the efficiency has increased tenfold to fifteenfold.
    On the edge of the feeding platform, I saw a young man who was feeding materials without a moment's rest. He was Du Wancai, a cook from the Eleventh Brigade. The cooking work was not easy, and he had to work more than ten hours a day, but after he delivered the meals to the construction site, he still had to work at the feeding platform for two and a half hours every day.
    Everyone is really motivated. I heard that when it rains, they are even more motivated. Many people carry four or six baskets to the dam, bare-chested. Everyone said, "Even the Dragon King has to be captured, what are we afraid of the raindrops?"
    This is our soldier! This is the communist style! They dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. They have created miracles! Comrade He Hua said it well: "These soldiers and laborers, some of them have not even gone to elementary school, but they are getting smarter and smarter as they work, and things are invented and created naturally."
    We came to the commercial brigade and met a female comrade named Che Ying. She is the instructor of the Third Brigade. She said, "You see, everyone is working so happily now, but there was a lot of twists and turns in the middle!" She said that the more than 900 members of this team are all employees of the Beijing Department Store system. After the various department stores learned from Tianqiao and caught up with Tianqiao, a large number of people were surplus. At that time, the slogan of catching up with England was put forward, and everyone had studied the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program, and their emotions were high, so they rushed to come to build the reservoir. Who knew that everything was unsatisfactory when they came. They encountered a strong wind on the first day, and they slept foot to foot. They ate cold corn buns and pickles. To go to and from work, they had to walk thirty-six miles. So there were a lot of opinions, and they wanted to go home. Some female comrades were afraid of the wind and the sun, so they wrapped their heads tightly with scarves and wore masks and sunglasses. How could this work? In April, the "double anti" campaign was launched on the construction site. First, they debated "for whom to work," and then they discussed the "political and economic significance of building the reservoir." All of a sudden, the construction site was like a fire, and the Third Brigade alone posted more than 1,500 big-character posters. Everyone was busy all day during the day, and they crawled on the ground to write big-character posters at night. As a result, the situation changed greatly, and many "delicate young ladies" now worked during the day and went back at night to scramble to wash and mend clothes and disassemble quilts for the male comrades. There are many advanced organizations. Zhao Yiman Team, Ma Lan Team, Zoya Team, Hu Lan Team, Flood Control Team, May Day Shock Team, Red and Expert Shock Team… The older ones are not to be outdone, and they formed a Huang Zhong Team. They pushed things weighing three or four hundred pounds and could walk a hundred or so miles up and down the slopes every day.
    Go to the agency headquarters. The cadres there said that almost all the cadres of Beijing agencies had come to the Ming Tombs to work.
    Gao Zhenkui is the deputy chief engineer of the construction site. He has been an engineer for more than 20 years. He said that he had never seen such a large project completed in such a short time. He said, "If it weren't for the socialist system, how could there be such a miracle?" Gao Zhenkui said that the masses are really amazing, and they have invented dozens of things. For example, no one has ever seen or even dared to think of a car carrying four buckets up a slope, but the masses have done it. Gao Zhenkui said with a smile: "The Ming Tombs Reservoir is also a good place to treat five airs." He said that when they first came, everyone was afraid of the cold, afraid of the heat, and afraid of not being able to bear it. Now it's all gone. Official airs have no market here, and the situation forces you to go to the construction site.
    His words reminded me of the technical personnel on the dam. They run around in the hot sun, taking clay samples and testing them on the spot. I heard that they used to have to take them to the tent to test them, which took a lot of travel, and they could only make 30 samples a day, but now they can make more than 100.
    I ran around the material yard south of the dam. Teachers and students from schools were mostly working here. I heard that more than 67,000 students have worked here. They have learned many things that they cannot learn in the classroom. I flipped through the "Labor Newspaper" they published, and it was full of feelings: what "The Education Given to Me by the Working People," what "Being a Student of the Masses," what "Who Raised Me, Who Gave Me Knowledge"…
    I met Dr. Zhang Bingjun from the affiliated hospital of Beijing Medical College. He said that his labor at the Ming Tombs was a triple harvest of politics, ideology, and production. He said that in the past, whether it was seeing patients or teaching, he was perfunctory, as long as he coped with it without making mistakes. He always thought about writing some profound theoretical articles and producing something of international standard. During the "double anti" campaign, his classmates posted many big-character posters criticizing him for taking the "white expert road." He began to realize that he could no longer not transform himself.
    When the teachers and students of Beijing Medical College were going to work at the Ming Tombs, he repeatedly asked to go.
    "The Ming Tombs is a labor university, and I have learned so many things." Dr. Zhang said: "When I first went, I was very excited, but I was so tired after working for less than two hours. Thinking that this was socialist construction, I persisted. In the past, I thought that physical labor was nothing! Only then did I really know that labor is not simple! Only then did I know the greatness of physical labor and the greatness of workers and peasants. I think, if there were no People's Liberation Army, peasants… only an engineer's drawing on the construction site, then nothing could be built.
    "Seeing the 100,000-strong labor force on the construction site, I thought to myself, what am I? I am just like a small ant carrying a grain of sand. How useful is this to the dam?! In the past, I always thought I was great, but now I think about it, this kind of arrogance is really a bit inexplicable!
    "In the past, I was always free and undisciplined, and I didn't want to be managed by anyone! When I went to the construction site, I realized that without organization and discipline, nothing could be done.
    "On the construction site, I truly felt the comradeship. Like the People's Liberation Army, they were exhausted, but they still wanted to help us. They also sent us food and water from time to time, and invited me to give them lectures, which really made me feel ashamed.
    "I also have a new view of the relationship between people in the hospital. In the past, everyone didn't communicate much, and they went their separate ways after work. This time, when we went to work, it rained heavily one day, and we were all soaked. Just then, the comrades at home brought us dry clothes. I took the clothes and cried with emotion. This was really sending charcoal in the snow. Labor has shortened the distance between us.
    "I have realized the strength of the masses, and I will definitely consult with everyone more in the future."
    Xu Zhengling, a student from the Zhao Yiman Team, wrote, "In the past, I used to shout all day long that exploitation was shameful and that I wanted to be a self-reliant worker. But in reality, I thought to myself, fortunately I was born in a capitalist family, otherwise, how could I go to university? After the school's red and expert debate, my understanding has improved a bit, so I asked to come down to work.
    When I carried the soil up the high slope of the material platform, my heart was beating and my legs were weak. Only then did I truly hate my family, and if it weren't for the comfort of my home, I wouldn't be so incompetent. I thought of the fact that what I eat and wear are all condensed from the blood and sweat of the working people. I want to pay off this debt in practical actions."
    Yes, the Ming Tombs Reservoir is a construction site, and also a communist school. Under this dam, how many people's individualism has been buried! How much dirt in people's minds has been washed away!

    劳动万岁
    ——十三陵水库工地札记
  　本报记者　傅冬
    车子到了昌平车站，我和同行的人发生了小小的争执，我说应该朝北走，由大红门绕到水库指挥部。别人笑我说，工地早变样了，我还用的老黄历。
    依着他们的话，往东北走了一会，眼前就出现了一大片房子。这是大孤山呀！今年2月我来过这里一回，那时间，这儿还是光秃秃的一片呢！现在，高高低低，左左右右全是帐篷、席篷，像新盖了一个城。
    我上到东山口的山头上，抬头一看，吓！汉包山和蟒山叫新起的一座一里多长，八、九层楼高的高山连起来了。这就是水库的主体工程——拦洪大坝。
    想去工地瞧瞧，碰巧，组织处的孙克洮同志要上工地，我就跟他去了。
    我们沿着汉包山的公路爬上山去。全工地都看得清清楚楚。工地上，到处是人。有十几条皮带运输机像一条条龙似的斜躺在坝腰上。坝上，夯板机一起一落地锤打着，炮车拖着羊角碾，来回地碾着。坝下，火车、汽车拖着一长串的斗车在小火车道上走着。上次我来的时候，斗车还是用人推，一个斗车装一、二吨土，推起来，真费劲！不知是谁想出来的好点子？孙克洮说：“全是战士！一个火车头，一下子能拉一百五十吨的土；‘汽车头’多的也能拉三十六吨土！”他停了一会，接着又指着中间一个冒烟的车头说：“听说那是法国送给西太后的火车，现在我们把它拖出来为社会主义服务了。”
    我们走进一个帆布帐篷里。这是土西段的现场指挥部。一屋子里全是部队同志。他们正忙着打电话，指挥工地，电话一个接一个。一个叫何化的同志说，别瞧战士没什么文化，办的却是大事。有个战士造了个翻板机，早先十五分钟才能装一车土，有了这玩艺，三秒钟就能装一车。说着，他又把我们领到帐篷外，指着西边山腰上的一座木桥说：“这是部队的一位师长想出来的。原先山上没路，坝修到七层楼那样高了，汽车带着几个斗子还直上直下地运土。坡太陡，丘惠镐副师长琢磨了几天，用四天功夫在半空里搭了座桥。一试，挺棒，能顶住十五吨的车。”
    民工队上，红旗似火。这个旗上写着“先锋大队”“模范中队”，那个写着：“优秀大队”“先进小组”，有一面旗子上写着：“卫星青年突击队”，别人说，这个队棒极了。工地上评了四次奖，回回都有他们。他们的队长徐世孝，更是个铁汉子。前些天把大腿上的骨头碰伤了，送到医院，治了一下，他只休息了两天，就又上班了。
    走到东坝上，看见几个人在一个一人多高的漏斗旁运料。这漏斗的样子，挺有意思，很像小娃娃用纸叠的裤子，皮带运输机运上来的沙子和石头正哗哗地吐进这漏斗里，接着又由这漏斗流进土筐里。工地上的人给我讲了个故事：这十几条皮带运输机从各学校、各机关运到工地后，很解决问题，不要成千成万的人往坝上担沙石了。可就是有一样不好，沙石吐的太急太猛，很容易砸伤人，再说也来不及装，大伙憋了一肚子劲，说非要给这些龙嘴上安个笼头不可。他们左思右想，弄出了这么个漏斗。现在这些龙一个个都服服贴贴的了，效率提高十倍至十五倍。
    在送料台的边边上，看见一个年青的小伙子，他一分钟都不闲地在送料。他是十一大队的炊事员杜万才。作饭的活儿不轻，一天要干十几小时，可是他把饭送到工地后，每天还要到送料台干二个半钟点的活。
    大伙的劲头真足，听说碰上下雨天，劲头更足。好些人光着膀子挑着四个筐、六个筐往坝上送料。大伙说：“龙王都要捉，雨点怕什么。”
    这就是我们的战士！这就是共产主义风格！他们敢想、敢说、敢干，他们创造了奇迹！何化同志说的好：“这些战士和民工，有的连小学都没念过，可是他们越干越聪明，东西就自然而然发明创造出来了。”
    我们来到了商业大队，遇到一位叫车颖的女同志。她是三大队的指导员。她说：“你们瞧，大家伙现在干的这么欢，这中间很有一番周折呢！”她说，这个队的九百多个队员，都是北京市百货公司系统的职工。各个百货公司学天桥、赶天桥后，富余出一大批人。那时间赶英国的口号提出来了，加上大伙学了农业发展纲要四十条，情绪高，都抢着要来修水库。谁知道来了事事不如意，头天就碰上了大风，睡的地方脚碰脚，吃的是冷窝头、咸菜。上下班，来回要走三十六里路。于是意见一大堆，想回家。有些女同志又怕风，又怕太阳，用围巾把头包得实实的，还戴上了口罩，黑眼镜。这怎么行？4月，在工地开展“双反”，先辩论“为谁劳动”，后讨论“修水库的政治、经济意义”。这一下，工地上像点了把火，光三大队一下子就贴了一千五百多张大字报。大伙白天忙了一天，晚上爬在地上写大字报。结果情况大变，许多“娇滴滴的小姐”，现在白天干活，晚上回去争着给男同志洗衣服、补衣服、拆被子。先进组织多得很。赵一曼组、马兰组、卓娅组、胡兰组、拦洪组、五一突击队、红专突击队……年纪大点的也不示弱，组成了个黄忠队。他们推着三、四百斤重的东西，一天也能走百十里上下坡路。
    到机关指挥部去。那里的干部说，北京各机关的干部差不多都来十三陵劳动过。
    高振奎是工地的副总工程师。他作了二十多年的工程师。他说他从来没见过这么大的工程用这么短的时间完成。他说：“要不是社会主义制度，那会有这样的奇迹？”高振奎说，群众真了不起，发明创造了几十件东西。比如汽车带四个斗子上坡，谁也没见过，甚至想都不敢想，但群众办到了。高振奎笑着说：“十三陵水库还是个治五气的好地方。”他说，刚来时，大伙怕冷、怕热、怕受不了。现在全没了。官气在这儿也没市场，形势逼得你非下工地不可。
    他的话，使我想起坝上的技术人员。他们在大太阳下，东跑西转，取粘土样子，当下就化验，听说以前他们要拿到帐篷里化验，来回要跑很多路，一天才能作三十个样子，现在可以作一百多个了。
    我到坝南的料场跑了一圈，学校的教师和学生多在这里劳动。听说已经有六万七千多学生劳动过了。他们学到许多在课堂上学不到的东西。我翻了翻他们办的“劳动报”，满纸都是感想：什么“劳动人民给我的教育”，什么“做群众的学生”，什么“是谁养活了我，是谁给了我知识”……
    我见到了北京医学院附属医院的张秉钧大夫，他说，他这次到十三陵劳动是政治、思想、生产三丰收。他说，以前在医院，不论是看病和教书他都马马虎虎，只要应付着不出错就行。自己成天想的是写点什么深奥的理论文章，搞出个有国际水平的东西。“双反”时，同学贴了许多大字报批评他走“白专道路”。他开始认识到自己再不能不改造了。
    北京医学院的师生要去十三陵劳动，他再三请求去。
    “十三陵是个劳动大学，我学了许许多多东西。”张大夫说：“乍一去，兴头高，可是还没干二个钟头，就累得半死不活了。想到这是社会主义建设，才坚持下来。过去我觉得体力劳动没什么！这时才真正知道劳动不简单！才知道体力劳动的伟大，工农的伟大。我想，工地上要是没解放军、农民……只有工程师一张图，那是什么也造不出的。
    “看到工地十万劳动大军，我心里想，我算个什么呢？我不过像一个小蚂蚁衔着一粒砂。这对大坝有多大用？！过去我一向以为自己了不起，现在想想，这种自高自大，实在有点莫名其妙！
    “过去我一向自由散漫，不愿叫人管我！到工地一看，认识到没组织没纪律，什么也干不成。
    “在工地上，我真正感到同志的友爱。像解放军他们累得够呛，可是他们还要帮我们。还不时给我们送饭送水，还请我去给他们讲演，这可真把我给羞死了。
    “对于医院里人与人的关系我也有了新的看法。过去大伙不大来往，下班各走各的。这次去劳动，有一天下大雨，我们浑身都湿透了，正在这时，家里的同志给我们送干衣服来了。我接着衣服，感动得哭了，这真是雪里送炭。劳动使我们之间的距离缩短了。
    “我认识了群众的力量，以后有事一定多找大伙商量。”
    赵一曼队一个叫许征龄的学生这样写道，“过去我一天到晚嚷剥削可耻，要作一个自食其力的劳动者。可是实际上我心里想，幸亏我生在资本家的家庭里，不然，我怎么会上大学呢？这次学校红专辩论后，认识上有点提高，才要求下来劳动。
    当我挑土爬上那料台的高坡时，我心跳，腿发软。这时我才真正恨起自己的家庭来，要不是家里舒服，自己也不会这样无能。我想起我吃的穿的都是劳动人民血汗凝成的。我要在实际行动中还清这笔债。”
    是的，十三陵水库是工地，也是共产主义学校，在这个大坝下埋葬了多少人的个人主义！洗净了多少人脑子里的肮脏！
