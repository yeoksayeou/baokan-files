    Anhui Province Arranges Autumn Planting Crops Early
    The Key to Striving for a Bumper Summer Harvest Next Year Lies in Conscientiously Implementing Technical Reform Measures

    (Our Newspaper Correspondent Yu Ming Reports) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied and arranged preparations for next year's major production as early as the seventh enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee on April 17 this year. Recently, it convened responsible cadres from agricultural departments and agricultural technology experts to further arrange autumn planting crops this year and discuss specific measures to increase production, striving to increase the summer harvest next year by more than double that of this year. In terms of ideology, the meeting pointed out that from top to bottom, from agricultural departments to other departments, it is necessary to establish the idea of preparing for next year's production this year. In particular, this idea should be widely publicized and educated in all cooperatives through vigorous airing of views, debates, just like this year's water conservancy movement. In terms of autumn sowing tasks, the meeting decided to expand the area by another eight million mu this year compared to last year. It requires all localities to arrange stubble in advance, minimize winter fallow land, and utilize all cultivatable land. In terms of production measures, discussions and decisions were made on seeds, fertilizers, tools, agents, and technical training. Regarding the seed issue, the meeting required that from now on, agricultural cooperatives in various localities should do a good job in selecting, retaining, preserving seeds, and the state's purchase and storage of improved seeds during the summer harvest, according to the needs of the stubble. It also designated special personnel to be responsible for safekeeping and conscientiously implement the responsibility system. Regarding the fertilizer issue, after the summer planting work is completed, a movement to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer will be launched. Starting from July, mass fertilizer accumulation will be carried out for three months to ensure that summer harvest crops have sufficient base fertilizer. It also called on all agricultural cooperatives to immediately organize professional fertilizer production teams and groups to be specifically responsible. Regarding the issue of technical training, in addition to on-site visits, evaluations, and training during the summer harvest, it was also decided that the province would launch large-scale training classes by the end of June, striving to have several people in each agricultural cooperative production team receive technical training before the autumn planting so that they can master cultivation techniques well.

    According to Anhui's situation, the meeting also put forward specific requirements for the specific technical measures of autumn planting crops. First of all, it requires the entire province to improve wheat varieties. The planting area of improved wheat varieties in the province has reached 90%. As long as all localities do a good job in selecting and retaining seeds during the summer harvest, this requirement can be achieved next year. It is necessary to thoroughly change the past habits of strip planting without close planting in Huaibei and spot planting without close planting along the Yangtze River, implement strip planting with close planting and spot planting with close planting, and change the method of broadcasting in the Huainan area to strip planting with close planting. It requires each mu of wheat to reach 350,000 to 400,000 plants. In the past, the winter irrigation area of wheat was less than one-tenth, and the average fertilizer application was only 200 dan. Now, three irrigations and four fertilizer applications should be implemented. Implementing autumn, winter, and spring irrigation can overcome the frequent autumn and spring droughts in Anhui and reduce late frost damage. Wheat should be fertilized four times according to needs. First of all, it is necessary to apply 1,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu before sowing. The meeting also proposed timely early sowing, deep plowing and fine harrowing, prevention of plant diseases and insect pests, and the universal implementation of wide-ridge and deep-ditch sowing methods. Anhui wheat often suffers from rust disease before maturity. With wide ridges and deep ditches, timely drainage can reduce soil temperature and prevent and mitigate rust disease.

    In order to effectively prevent rust disease next year, the meeting has deployed Tongguanshan, Ma'anshan, Anqing, and other places to produce sulfur in large quantities.

    The meeting pointed out that increasing the yield of summer harvest crops is key to greatly increasing the yield per unit area, and increasing yield per unit area requires conscientious implementation of the above specific technical measures. For example, the Tongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Funan County last year conscientiously implemented the above-mentioned key technical measures, and the average yield of more than 4,000 mu of wheat in 1957 reached 210 jin per mu. There were 12 mu of high-yield fields, reaching 1,063 jin per mu. The wheat of the First She of the Liu'an Pi Dong implemented the above technical measures, and the estimated yield of 2,200 mu of wheat this year is 786 jin per mu, and there are more than 750 mu with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu.

    The meeting once again pointed out that summer harvest crops have a special role in disaster prevention and yield protection in Anhui, and wheat also has high-yield conditions, which must be taken seriously. It is of great significance for achieving the agricultural program ahead of schedule. "Three years are judged by the first year, the first year is judged by the previous winter"; and the quality of the previous winter's work depends on how well the preparations for autumn planting are done from now on. Now that we have entered the summer harvest season, the meeting called on all localities to select high-yield typical examples, conduct visits and evaluations, and carry out on-site debates in order to summarize experience in a timely manner. The Provincial Party Committee has selected three typical examples in Jingxian County in southern Anhui, Liu'an in Huainan, and Guoyang in Huaibei as evaluation objects, and requires each township to select a typical cooperative to convene all cooperatives to participate in the evaluation, and treat the evaluation as a movement in order to widely carry out ideological education and disseminate technology.

    三年看头年　头年看前冬　前冬看现在
    安徽提早安排秋种作物
    争取明年夏季丰收的关键在于认真贯彻技术改革措施
    本报讯　记者于明报道：中共安徽省委对明年大生产的准备工作，早在今年4月17日省委第七次扩大会上已经作了研究和安排；最近，又召集农业部门的负责干部和农业技术专家开会，进一步安排了今年秋种作物，并讨论了具体增产措施，力争明年夏季收成比今年增加一倍以上。在思想方面，会议指出：从上到下，从农业部门以至其他各部门，都要树立起今年为明年作好生产准备的思想，特别要把这一思想在所有合作社经过大鸣大放、大辩论，好像今年的水利运动一样，展开广泛的宣传教育。在秋播任务方面，会议决定今年要比去年再扩大八百万亩。要求各地及早安排好茬口，尽量减少冬闲田，将能够种植的土地都利用起来。在生产措施方面，对种子、肥料、工具、药剂、技术训练等，都作了讨论和决定。关于种子问题，会议要求从现在起，各地农业社在夏收中就按照茬口需要作好选种、留种、保种工作和国家购贮良种工作。并指定专人负责保管，切实贯彻责任制。肥料问题，夏种工作完毕以后，便要发动砍草积肥运动。从7月起，大规模积肥三个月，保证夏收作物有足够的基肥；并号召各农业社立即组织专业造肥队、造肥组，以便专门负责。技术训练问题，除了通过夏收中现场参观评比训练外，并决定全省在6月底即大规模的开办训练班，争取在秋种前，每一个农业社的生产队都有几人受到技术训练，以便能够很好地掌握栽培技术。
    会议根据安徽情况，对秋种作物的具体技术措施也提了具体要求。首先要求全省小麦良种化。全省小麦的良种播种面积已达90％，各地只要在夏收中作好选种、留种工作，明年便可实现这一要求。要彻底改变过去淮北条播而不密植，沿江点播而不密植的习惯，实行条播密植和点播密植，并把淮南地区的撒种改变为条播密植。要求每亩小麦达到三十五万到四十万株。过去小麦冬灌面积不到十分之一，施肥平均只有二百担。现在要实行三水四肥。实行秋灌冬灌、春灌，便可以克服安徽经常遭受的秋旱、春旱，并可减轻晚霜灾害。小麦根据需要情况要施肥四次，首先是要在播种前每亩施足底肥一千担。会议还提出要适时早播，深耕细耙，防止病虫害以及普遍实行宽畦深沟的播种方法。安徽小麦经常在成熟前发生锈病，有了宽畦深沟，便可及时排水，减少土地温度，防止和减轻锈病。
    为了明年有效防治锈病，会议已布置铜官山、马鞍山、安庆等地大量生产硫磺。
    会议指出，增加夏收作物的产量，关键在于大大提高单位面积产量，而提高单产则必须认真贯彻以上各项具体技术措施。如去年阜南县的同光农业社，因为认真贯彻了上述几项主要技术措施，1957年四千多亩小麦平均每亩达到二百一十斤；有十二亩高额丰产田，每亩达到了一千零六十三斤。六安淠东一社小麦，实行了以上技术措施，今年二千二百亩小麦预计每亩可收到七百八十六斤，并有七百五十多亩，单产可达一千斤以上。
    会议再一次指出，夏收作物在安徽有避灾保收的特殊作用，而且麦子还有高产条件，必须加以重视，它对于提前实现农业纲要具有重要意义。“三年看头年，头年看前冬”；而前冬的工作好坏，则要看从现在起对秋种的准备工作做得如何而定。现在已经进入夏收季节，会议号召各地选择高额丰产典型，进行参观、评比，开展现场辩论，以便及时总结经验。省委已选择了皖南泾县、淮南六安、淮北涡阳的三个典型作为评比对象，并要求每个乡都选择一个典型社召集各社参加评比，把评比当成一个运动，以便广泛地进行思想教育，传播技术。
