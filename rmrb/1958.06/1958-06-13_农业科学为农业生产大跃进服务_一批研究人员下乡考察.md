Agricultural Science Serves the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
　　A Group of Researchers Go to the Countryside for Investigation

　　(Our Newspaper) Professor Ding Ying, President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and a rice cultivation expert, led a comprehensive scientific work team composed of scientific research personnel from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, combined with local agricultural scientific research personnel, to western Guangdong on the 19th to support the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. President Ding and this work team went to western Guangdong after visiting and understanding the agricultural production situation in eastern Guangdong, especially the rice growth situation. The work team is composed of professionals in soil, fertilizer, plant protection, agronomy, and agricultural meteorology. They will start by learning, investigating, and summarizing the high-yield experiences in low-yield areas, further identify the causes of low yields, conduct scientific analysis and research, and then promote them in order to quickly change the face of low-yield areas.
