Column: Notes

    The American "Washington Post," in an article entitled "Prestige Began to Be Lost Long Ago," said that Nixon was beaten in South America because he promoted a "Asia First" foreign policy for the United States during his travels throughout Asia in 1953. Because of this policy, the United States bought more tropical products such as coffee, cocoa, and tin from Asia and Africa, and less from Latin America, which caused dissatisfaction in Latin America.
    In fact, everyone knows that the anti-American sentiment of the Latin American people is not because the United States bought less coffee and cocoa, but because American monopoly capital has squeezed too much from the Latin American people. The "Washington Post's" defense is nothing more than an attempt to cover up the aggressive nature of American foreign policy.

    抢的太多
    美国“华盛顿邮报”在一篇题为“威信早就开始丧失了”的文章中说，尼克松在南美所以挨揍，是因为他在1953年在亚洲各处巡游时提倡美国采取“亚洲第一”的外交政策。由于这样一种政策，美国多买了亚非的热带产物咖啡、可可、锡和其它东西，少买了拉丁美洲的东西，因而引起拉丁美洲的不满。
    其实，谁都知道拉丁美洲人民的反美情绪不是因为美国少买了咖啡、可可，倒是因为美国垄断资本从拉丁美洲人民身上搜刮太多了。“华盛顿邮报”这种辩解，无非是想掩盖美国外交政策的侵略实质罢了。
