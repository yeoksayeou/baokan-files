    The people of all strata in Vietnam and overseas compatriots are very concerned about the Eighth Session of the National Assembly held in April. This is because this National Assembly meeting was convened under the circumstances that the international and domestic situations have undergone significant changes, which are conducive to the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people and to socialism and world peace. Under this situation, this National Assembly meeting discussed many important issues related to the fate of all Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese motherland, and the central issue was to promote the entry of North Vietnam into socialism. This is the first time the National Assembly has discussed this issue.
    The National Assembly unanimously adopted the government's political report, and unanimously agreed to the general line proposed by the government on North Vietnam's transition to the stage of socialist revolution and uniting the people of the whole country to peacefully enter socialism. The speeches of the representatives of all strata, religions, and ethnic groups in the North and South unanimously reflected the enthusiasm of the Vietnamese people for the cause of socialist revolution. The representatives unanimously agreed with the analysis made in Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's report: "In North Vietnam today, the motherland and socialism cannot be separated. To love the country is to love socialism, and to love socialism is to love the country even more."
    The National Assembly representatives unanimously believed that building socialism in North Vietnam is not only in line with the aspirations of the people in the North, but also a great encouragement to the people in the South. Therefore, it is completely in line with the task of struggling for the unification of the motherland. Building socialism in the North and making the North prosperous is to lay the foundation for completing the national and democratic revolution throughout the country, and to strengthen the forces against the interference of US imperialism—the main obstacle to the unification of the motherland—in South Vietnam.
    The documents of this National Assembly meeting further clarified the leading role of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the working class. It is precisely because of this leadership that significant victories have been achieved in the previous stage of the revolution. In the stage of socialist revolution, this leadership is even more important.
    At the same time, this National Assembly meeting also affirmed the position of solidarity and mutual assistance between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and demonstrated the positive attitude of the Vietnamese people in defending the cause of world peace. This position and attitude were embodied in the meeting documents and in the statement of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on supporting the Soviet Union's initiative to unilaterally cease the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    The National Assembly not only unanimously agreed with the government's position and general line, but also unanimously adopted the government's specific policies and proposals, adopted the 1958 national budget, and adopted various bills and measures aimed at improving the people's democratic state institutions.
    In his speech at the opening of the National Assembly meeting, President Ho Chi Minh said: "The Party and the government believe that since the day peace was restored, the North of our country has shifted from the stage of national and people's democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution... The transition of the revolutionary stage requires us to have a profound change in ideology and understanding, and requires various policies, measures and organizational work that are in line with the new situation." The success of this National Assembly meeting marks a major change in the ideology and understanding of the Vietnamese people.
    It should be pointed out that not long ago, among the Vietnamese people and National Assembly representatives, some people's thoughts and understanding could not keep up with the transition of the revolutionary stage. Some people still viewed the people and affairs of the new revolutionary stage from the standpoint of the previous revolutionary stage. Therefore, they had an unclear understanding of the achievements in basic aspects and temporary shortcomings and errors, of the favorable conditions and difficulties of the Vietnamese revolution in the past three years, and of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary and the imperialist aggression against Egypt. Therefore, some people inevitably wavered and panicked in the face of the slanders against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and against North Vietnam and the Vietnam Workers' Party, spread by domestic and foreign enemies.
    Not long ago, the two meetings of representatives of communist and workers' parties in Moscow, the Soviet Union's first launch of the world's first and second artificial earth satellites, and the recent launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite, as well as the rapid development of China and other socialist countries, have prompted people to recognize that "the main content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was started by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia."
    Domestically, the work of economic recovery has been basically completed. The end of the land reform rectification work has made the land reform a final and victorious completion. These achievements have laid the foundation and created favorable conditions for the new era—that is, the era of developing and transforming our country's economy and culture according to the socialist road. These achievements have also shattered the conspiracy to spread doubts about the leading role of the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    The clarification of the international and domestic situation has helped people achieve consistency with the Party and the government in their understanding of the new stage of revolution in North Vietnam.
    The unanimity of this National Assembly meeting embodies the unity between the people and the Party and the government.
    The success of this National Assembly meeting has answered the urgent wishes of the Vietnamese people. The spirit of the documents of this National Assembly meeting will penetrate into the people of the whole country, and it will promote the people of all strata in Vietnam to further advance in their understanding of the socialist revolution and in their thinking. It will inspire the people of the whole country and guide them to exert all their strength. It will promote the further unity of the Vietnamese people, enhance the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people, and strive for the glorious victory in the future, for building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic and prosperous Vietnam, and for making a positive contribution to defending world peace.

    越南民主共和国向社会主义胜利迈进
    越南民主共和国国会常务委员会委员长  孙德胜
    越南国内各阶层人民和海外侨胞都非常关心4月间召开的国会第八次会议。这是因为这一次国会会议是在国际形势和国内形势都有了重大的变化，有利于越南人民的革命斗争，有利于社会主义和世界和平的情况下召开的。在这种形势之下，这次国会会议讨论了关系到全体越南人民和越南祖国的命运的许多重大问题，而中心问题是促使越南北方进入社会主义的问题。这是国会第一次讨论到的问题。
    国会一致通过了政府的政治报告，一致同意政府提出的关于越南北方转入社会主义革命阶段以及团结全国人民和平进入社会主义的总路线。北方和南方的各阶层、各宗教、各民族的代表的发言，都一致反映出了越南人民对于社会主义革命事业的热情。代表们一致同意范文同总理报告中所作的分析：“在越南北方的今天，祖国和社会主义是不能分开的。爱国就是爱社会主义，而爱社会主义就更加热爱祖国。”
    国会代表们一致认为，越南北方建设社会主义不仅符合于北方人民的愿望，而且对南方人民也是一种巨大的鼓舞力量，因而它完全符合于为统一祖国而斗争的任务。在北方建设社会主义，使北方富强起来，就是为在全国范围内完成民族和民主革命奠定基础，也就是加强反对美帝国主义——统一祖国的主要阻力——干涉越南南方的斗争力量。
    这次国会会议的文件进一步地明确了越南劳动党和工人阶级的领导作用。正是由于这种领导，前一革命阶段已经取得了重大的胜利。在社会主义革命阶段，这种领导就更为重要。
    同时，这次国会会议也肯定了以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结和互助的立场，并且表明了越南人民在保卫世界和平事业中的积极态度。这种立场和态度在会议文件中以及越南民主共和国国会关于支持苏联单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的倡议的声明中体现了出来。
    国会不仅一致同意政府的立场和总路线，还一致通过了政府的各项具体政策主张，通过了1958年国家预算，通过了目的在于健全人民民主国家机构的各项法案和措施。
    胡志明主席在国会会议开幕时所作的讲话中说：“党和政府认为，自恢复和平的那一天起，我国的北方已经从民族和人民民主革命阶段转入社会主义革命的阶段……革命阶段的转变要求我们在思想上和认识上需要有深刻的转变，要求须有符合于新形势的各种政策、措施和组织工作”。这次国会会议的成功，标志着越南人民在思想上和认识上的一个重大转变。
    应该指出，在不久以前，在越南人民以及国会代表中间，有一部分人的思想和认识还跟不上革命阶段的转变。有的人还站在前一革命阶段的立场上来看待新的革命阶段的事和人，因此，对于基本方面的成绩和暂时的缺点错误，对于三年来越南革命所处的有利条件和困难认识不清，对于匈牙利的反革命叛乱和帝国主义侵略埃及的战争等等认识不足。因而有一些人在国内外敌人的诽谤苏联和各社会主义国家，诽谤越南北方和越南劳动党的论调面前免不了动摇和惊惶失措。
    不久前，各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行的两个会议，苏联最先发射了世界上第一和第二个人造地球卫星，最近苏联第三颗人造地球卫星又上了天，以及中国和其他社会主义国家的飞跃发展，这一切促使人们认清了“我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡”。
    在国内，恢复经济的工作已经基本完成。土改纠偏工作的结束，使土地改革获得了最后胜利的完成。以上这些成绩，给新的时期——即按照社会主义的道路来发展和改造我国的经济和文化的时期打下了基础和创造了有利的条件。这些成绩也粉碎了散布对越南劳动党领导作用的怀疑的阴谋。
    国际形势和国内形势的明朗化，帮助了人们在对越南北方的革命新阶段的认识上与党和政府取得了一致。
    这次国会会议的一致性，就是体现了人民与党、政府之间的一致性。
    这次国会会议的成功，回答了越南人民的迫切愿望。这次国会会议文件的精神将深入到全国人民当中，它将推动越南各阶层人民在对社会主义革命的认识上和在思想上前进一步。它使全国人民振奋，引导人民发挥出一切力量。它促进越南人民的进一步团结，增强越南人民的斗志，为将来的光辉胜利，为建设和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而奋斗，为保卫世界和平作出积极的贡献。
