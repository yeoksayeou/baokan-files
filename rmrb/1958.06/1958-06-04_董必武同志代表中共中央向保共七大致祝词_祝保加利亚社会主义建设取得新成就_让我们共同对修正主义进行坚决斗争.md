Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 3rd: Comrade Dong Biwu, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on the 3rd. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrades,

Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I, on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extend warm and fraternal congratulations to the delegates of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, all members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Bulgarian people.

Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have achieved tremendous successes in socialist construction in a short period of time, establishing heavy industry that never existed in the past, and rapidly developing light industry. It has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with developed industry and advanced cooperative agriculture.

Now, the Bulgarian people have victoriously completed the Second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, bringing about significant changes in the proportion of industry and agriculture, from 24.8 to 75.2 in 1939 to 68.3 to 31.7 in 1957. You have also achieved historic victories in the socialist transformation of the countryside, with nearly 92% of arable land joining agricultural production cooperatives.

Due to the continuous economic development and a series of measures taken by the Party and the government to improve the people's livelihood, the living standards of the Bulgarian people have been significantly improved.

Your current congress will adopt the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of Bulgaria's national economy. We believe that the completion of this plan will ensure further economic upsurge in Bulgaria and strengthen the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people have consistently been loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, making significant contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. In international affairs, the Bulgarian government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, making unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the achievements of the Bulgarian Communist Party in leading the Bulgarian people in building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

The people of China and Bulgaria have long established a deep friendship. The Chinese people are very familiar with and respect the outstanding activist of the international workers’ movement, the great leader of the Bulgarian people, Georgi Dimitrov, who gave strong support and encouragement to the Chinese people’s liberation struggle, and made immortal contributions to the establishment of friendship between the two peoples. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Bulgaria in political, economic, and cultural fields have made increasingly comprehensive progress. We believe that the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian people, based on the great Marxism-Leninism as a common ideological foundation and with the common goal of building socialism, will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after basically completing the socialist revolution on the economic front, i.e., the ownership of the means of production, in 1956, launched the rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists in 1957, which was our country's socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. Now this struggle has achieved a decisive victory, which has thoroughly changed the spiritual outlook of our people and greatly enhanced their communist consciousness.

Our China has already overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan last year and has now entered the Second Five-Year Plan period. Under the illumination of the general line and general policy of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and under the encouragement of slogans such as "catching up with Britain in 15 years or less" and "working hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of most areas," a new situation of a great leap forward in socialist construction has been launched throughout the country. From January to April of this year, our country's total industrial output value increased by 26% compared with the same period last year, of which April increased by 42%; agricultural construction has also been greatly strengthened. It is expected that this year's total industrial and agricultural output value in our country will have an amazing development compared with any previous year. We firmly believe that with the hard work of the people throughout the country, and through the new technological revolution and cultural revolution recently launched, we will surely be able to rapidly build our country into a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture

The current international situation favors the people of all countries engaged in peaceful socialist construction, and it favors the people of all countries engaged in the struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has long surpassed the imperialist camp in terms of popular support, population, and rapid production development. The Soviet Union's successive launches of three artificial satellites show that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in science and technology. In 1957, the meetings of the twelve communist and workers' parties and the sixty-four communist parties held in Moscow greatly strengthened the unity of the international working class and the socialist camp, and promoted the development of the world peace movement. Recently, a series of peace initiatives put forward by the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union's first suspension of nuclear weapons testing, and the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea have greatly increased the prestige of the socialist camp among peace-loving people and countries around the world. Contrary to the booming socialist situation, the head of the imperialist camp, the United States, is now in a new and serious economic crisis, which is impacting the entire capitalist world. All this shows that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind and will continue to prevail over the West wind.

In the sharp struggle between the contemporary socialist system and the capitalist system, between the working class and the bourgeoisie, in order to save themselves from destruction, imperialism, in addition to adopting means such as expanding armaments, threatening war, carrying out armed aggression, plotting subversion, and intensifying exploitation and suppression of their own people and the people of colonies and semi-colonies, also desperately tries to undermine socialist countries and the international communist movement from within. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia recently adopted an anti-Marxist-Leninist and thorough revisionist program at its Seventh Congress, which is exactly what imperialism, especially US imperialism, needs. This program is in opposition to the declaration of the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties, and fundamentally violates interests of international communist movement. Therefore, we must wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism represented by the LCY leadership. Our irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism is consistent with the spirit of the CPC Central Committee and the CPSU Central Committee in criticizing modern revisionism. We believe that only by thoroughly opposing modern revisionism and resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism can we consolidate the unity of the international communist movement and socialist countries. Only on the basis of this unity can we further unite the workers of the world, unite all people in the world who oppose imperialism, oppose war, and oppose national enslavement, and jointly struggle for greater victories for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and socialism.

Finally, please allow me to sincerely congratulate you on the complete success of this congress! Please allow me to read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to your congress:

To the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and all the people of China, extends warm fraternal congratulations to the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

Under the correct leadership of the Bulgarian Communist party , Bulgarian People have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Now Bulgaria has changed from a backward agricultural country into a country with developed socialist industry and advanced cooperative agriculture.

The Bulgarian Communist Party has also made significant contributions to opposing imperialism, defending world peace, and supporting the liberation movements of oppressed nations and the struggle of peoples of all countries for socialism.

The Bulgarian Communist Party is a working-class party with rich revolutionary traditions. It stands firmly on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and has waged a resolute struggle against revisionism that opposes Marxism-Leninism in order to defend the unity within the international communist movement.

All the great achievements made by the Bulgarian Communist Party in its struggle have greatly encouraged the Chinese people.

The Communist Party of China firmly believes that the conv

　　董必武同志代表中共中央向保共七大致祝词
    祝保加利亚社会主义建设取得新成就
    让我们共同对修正主义进行坚决斗争
    新华社索非亚3日电  中国共产党代表团团长董必武同志3日在保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会上致祝词，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，谨代表中国共产党和中国人民，向保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的代表们、保加利亚共产党的全体党员和保加利亚人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在短短的时期内，取得了社会主义建设的巨大成就，建立了过去从未有过的重工业，并且迅速地发展了轻工业。它已经从一个落后的农业国变成为一个有发达的工业和先进的合作化农业的社会主义工业农业国。
    现在保加利亚人民已经胜利地完成了发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，使工农业的比重发生了重大的变化，从1939年的二四·八比七五·二变成为1957年的六八·三比三一·七。你们在农村中的社会主义改造也已经取得了历史性的胜利，近92％的耕地加入了农业生产合作社。
    由于经济的不断发展，以及党和政府采取了一系列改善人民生活的措施，保加利亚人民的生活水平已经有了显著的提高。
    你们的这次代表大会将通过保加利亚发展国民经济的第三个五年计划。我们相信这个计划的完成，将保证保加利亚国民经济的进一步高涨，并将增强世界和平、民主和社会主义事业的力量。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则，在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面，作出了重大的贡献。在国际事务中，保加利亚政府一贯奉行和平的对外政策，为缓和国际紧张局势，维护欧洲和世界和平的事业进行了不懈的努力。
    中国共产党和中国人民对于保加利亚共产党领导保加利亚人民在建设社会主义事业和保卫世界和平事业上所取得的成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中保两国人民早已建立了深厚的友谊，中国人民十分熟悉和尊敬国际工人运动的杰出活动家、保加利亚人民的伟大领袖——格奥尔基·季米特洛夫，他对中国人民的解放斗争曾经给了有力的支持和鼓舞，对中保两国人民友谊的建立，作出了不朽的贡献。近几年来，中保两国之间的政治、经济和文化各方面的友好合作关系获得了日益全面的进展。我们相信，以伟大的马克思列宁主义为共同思想基础、以建设社会主义为共同目标的中保两国人民的友谊和合作，必将继续不断地获得巩固和发展。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在1956年基本上完成了在经济战线上，即生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命以后，又在1957年展开了整风运动和反右派的斗争，这是我国在思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命。现在这个斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利，它彻底地改变了我国人民的精神面貌，大大地提高了我国人民的共产主义觉悟。
    我们中国，在去年已经超额地完成了第一个五年计划，现在已经进入了第二个五年计划时期。全国人民在“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总方针、总路线的照耀下，在“十五年或者更短的时间内赶上英国”“苦战三年，争取大部分地区的面貌基本改观”等口号的鼓舞下，已经掀起了一个建设社会主义的大跃进的新的局面。我国今年1月到4月的工业总产值，比去年同期增长了26％，其中4月份增长42％；农业方面，也大大加强了建设。预计我国今年的工农业总产值将比过去任何一年有惊人的发展。我们深信，在全国人民奋发努力之下，通过最近掀起的新的技术革命和文化革命，我们一定能够迅速地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的国家。
    目前的国际形势有利于从事社会主义的和平建设的各国人民，有利于从事争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的各国人民。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，在人心归向、人口众多、生产发展迅速等方面，早就超过了帝国主义阵营。苏联接连三颗人造卫星上天，表明苏联在科学技术方面已远远超过了最发达的资本主义国家——美国。1957年，在莫斯科举行的十二国共产党和工人党会议和六十四个共产主义政党的会议，大大加强了国际工人阶级队伍和社会主义阵营的团结，促进了世界和平运动的发展。最近以来，苏联和东欧各兄弟国家所提出的一系列的和平倡议，苏联首先停止核武器的试验，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退，更大大增加了社会主义阵营在全世界爱好和平的人民和国家中的威望。与社会主义蒸蒸日上的形势相反，帝国主义阵营的首脑美国，现在已经陷入新的严重的经济危机，这个危机正在冲击整个资本主义世界。这一切，都说明了东风已经压倒西风，而且将继续压倒西风。
    在当代社会主义制度和资本主义制度、工人阶级和资产阶级的尖锐斗争的情况下，帝国主义为了挽救自己的灭亡，除了采取扩充军备、战争威胁、进行武力侵略、阴谋颠复、加紧对于本国人民和殖民地半殖民地人民的剥削和镇压这些手段以外，还竭力企图从我们内部来破坏社会主义国家和国际共产主义运动。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟最近在它的第七次代表大会上通过了一个反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，它恰恰适合于帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的需要。这个纲领同共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的宣言相对抗，根本违反了国际共产主义运动的利益。因此，我们必须同以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。我们对现代修正主义作不调和的斗争是和保共中央、苏共中央批判现代修正主义的精神一致的。我们认为，只有彻底反对现代修正主义，坚决地保卫马克思列宁主义，才能巩固国际共产主义运动和社会主义国家的团结。只有在这种团结的基础上，我们才能进一步团结全世界的劳动者，团结全世界一切反对帝国主义、反对战争、反对民族奴役的人们，共同为世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义的更大胜利而斗争。
    最后，请让我衷心地祝贺你们这次代表大会圆满成功！请让我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致你们的代表大会的贺电：保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会：
    中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党的全体党员和全中国人民，向保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    在保加利亚共产党的正确领导之下，保加利亚人民在社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。现在保加利亚已经从一个落后的农业国家变成为一个有发达的社会主义工业和先进的合作化农业的国家了。
    保加利亚共产党在反对帝国主义，保卫世界和平，以及支持被压迫民族的解放运动和各国人民争取社会主义的斗争中，也作出了重大的贡献。
    保加利亚共产党是一个富有革命传统的工人阶级的政党。它坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的基础上，为保卫国际共产主义运动内部的团结，同反对马克思列宁主义的修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。
    保加利亚共产党在斗争中所取得的一切伟大成就，大大地鼓舞了中国人民。
    中国共产党坚决相信，保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的召开，对于进一步促进保加利亚的社会主义建设事业，对于反对帝国主义，保卫世界和平的事业，对于粉碎破坏国际共产主义运动团结的以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、各国共产党人的团结、中保两党的团结，必将作出新的贡献。
    衷心地热烈地祝贺保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会的圆满成功！
                  中国共产党中央委员会
                            1958年6月1日
