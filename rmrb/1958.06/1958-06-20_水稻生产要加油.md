    Rice Production Needs a Boost

    Since entering May, news of good harvests has been flying all over the motherland's sky like spring swallows; new high-yield records are surging towards us like rolling waves, each one higher than the last. From the north and south of the Yangtze River to the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River, there is a scene of bumper harvest everywhere. The news of rapeseed production increasing by 60% and the emergence of a new record of more than 800 jin per mu had barely subsided when the triumphant song of an unprecedented wheat harvest was sung. At present, although wheat harvesting varies from place to place due to seasonal differences, and the final national output has not yet been tallied, the situation is definitely better than that of rapeseed. Last year, only five or six places in the country had small plots of land, at most three to five mu, where records of over 1,000 jin were achieved. This year, all wheat-producing areas, all provinces, and almost all counties have seen records of 1,000 jin per mu. The area with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu is no longer one, two, three, or five mu. If we take a province as a unit, it is already tens of thousands of mu, or even hundreds of thousands of mu. Last year, when people were planning this year's wheat output, a yield of 2,000 jin per mu was considered impossible by many. This year, a yield of 2,500 jin or 3,000 jin per mu is no longer an isolated phenomenon, and even high-yield records of over 3,500 jin or 4,000 jin per mu have appeared.

    Rapeseed and wheat, which have always been called "low-yield crops," have advanced rapidly. They have thrown that shameful hat of "low-yield crops" on the ground and squeezed into the glorious ranks of high-yield crops. This is the first great victory and the first batch of fruitful results of the Party and the vast number of peasants fighting through the winter and spring.

    The great Lenin said: The end of one struggle means the beginning of another. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong also often teach us with the theory of continuous revolution. Now, the struggle to win a bumper harvest of rapeseed and wheat this year has come to a victorious end; the next struggle, the struggle to win a bumper harvest of autumn crops, especially rice, has come before us. We have won the victory of the rapeseed and wheat harvest, and we must win an even greater victory in the autumn crops, especially rice.

    Rice has always enjoyed the reputation of being a high-yield crop in our country. Last year, when the average yield of rice in our country reached more than 350 jin per mu, the average yield of wheat was only more than 110 jin. The yield of rice is more than twice that of wheat. This year, wheat has caught up. Its yield per unit area and total output have increased not by a few percent, or a dozen percent, but by dozens of percent. Some provinces, more prefectures and counties, and thousands of agricultural cooperatives have even grown at a rate of one or two times or higher. The total output of wheat and other summer grain crops has increased by about 50% compared with last year. If wheat can grow so rapidly, why can't rice, which has always been known as a high-yield crop? Taking early rice as an example, this year our country planted a total of 160 million mu of early rice. If the average yield per mu increases by 50%, from more than 300 jin per mu last year to 500 jin, the country can harvest 80 billion jin of rice, accounting for about 20% or more of the country's total grain output last year. Striving for a more rapid increase in rice production is of great significance and role in striving for a bumper harvest of agriculture throughout the year and in improving the country's socialist construction and people's lives!

    Are there conditions for striving for a more rapid increase in rice production? We believe that the existing conditions are very good and sufficient. The vast number of cadres have the experience of leading farmers to strive for a great leap forward in wheat production, and farmers in many areas also have advanced experience in rice cultivation. Conscientiously summarizing these experiences and creatively applying them can promote a great leap forward in rice production. After the upsurge of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the drainage and irrigation conditions of rice fields in our country this year are better than ever before, which has created very important and favorable conditions for rice growth. The situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, which was set off on the basis of the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign, has made this year's early rice in our country planted earlier and denser than in any previous year, with more base fertilizer and vigorous growth, which has laid a good foundation for a bumper harvest of early rice this year. Recently, due to the promulgation of the general line of socialist construction, the enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants has been further increased, which is a more powerful impetus and encouragement for striving for a bumper harvest of rice. As long as we are more closely integrated with the vast number of peasants, put in more effort than we did to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, fight drought when there is drought, prevent waterlogging when there is waterlogging, eliminate insects when there are insects, and eliminate diseases and pests when there are diseases and pests, we will definitely be able to strive for a greater harvest of rice than wheat.

    Now, there is still about a month left before the harvest season of early rice in most areas, and the harvest time of mid-season rice will be later. It is a critical moment for the growth of early and mid-season rice. There is still much to be done in the struggle to strive for a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice. As long as we strengthen field management, do a good job in cultivating and fertilizing, as well as preventing drought and waterlogging, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and eliminating three types of fields, we will definitely be able to win a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice. Now is also the time for sowing and raising seedlings for other autumn crops and late rice. As long as we do a better job in deep plowing, selecting good seeds, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and implementing early sowing and dense planting, we will definitely be able to strive for a bumper harvest of other autumn crops and late rice.

    This is not to say that we will not encounter any difficulties in the struggle to strive for a bumper rice harvest. There are still difficulties. For example, most rice areas are currently busy with summer harvesting and planting, and there are difficulties in terms of labor to strengthen field management of rice; for example, most of the fertilizer has been used for spring crops, and there is currently a great shortage of fertilizer for rice fields. In addition, unexpected natural disasters may occur. However, as long as we pay attention early, face up to the difficulties, boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the enthusiasm and labor passion of the vast number of peasants, and rely on the wisdom and strength of the vast number of peasants, all these difficulties can be overcome.

    After the nationwide rectification movement, after the great leap forward last winter and this spring, after the publicity of the Party's general line of socialist construction, and after the practical struggle to strive for a bumper harvest of rapeseed and wheat, the vast number of peasants, whose morale is higher, whose experience is richer, and whose communist consciousness is more enhanced, have already been able to win in the first round, and they will definitely be able to triumph in the second round. Since the peasant masses have already made the low-yield crops of rapeseed and wheat become high-yield crops, they will definitely be able to make rice, which is already a high-yield crop, achieve an even greater harvest and increase production at a faster rate.

    Come on, peasants in rice-growing areas! Create greater miracles and achieve higher records!

### 水稻生产要加油

    水稻生产要加油
    进入5月以来，丰收的喜报像春天的燕子，在祖国的天空到处飞翔；高额丰产的新纪录如滚滚海浪，一个高似一个地向我们涌来。从大江南北到黄河上下，到处是一片丰收景象。油菜增产60％，并出现了亩产八百多斤新纪录，捷声未息，小麦空前丰收的凯歌又唱。目前，虽然由于季节的差异，各地小麦收获有早有晚，全国的产量还没有最后统计出来，但情况比油菜还要好则是肯定的了。去年，全国小麦只有五、六个地方在一、二亩，至多三、五亩的小块土地上，出现过一千多斤的纪录。今年，所有的产麦区，所有的省，也几乎是所有的县，都出现了亩产千斤的纪录。亩产千斤的面积，再不是一、二亩或三、五亩了。如果以省为单位，已经是几万亩、甚至几十万亩了。去年，人们在规划今年小麦产量的时候，亩产两千斤曾经被很多人看成是不可能的事情。今年，亩产两千五百斤、三千斤却已经不是个别现象，甚至亩产三千五百斤、四千斤以上的高产纪录也已经出现了。
    从来就被人叫作“低产作物”的油菜、小麦，快步前进了。它们已经把那顶不光彩的“低产作物”的帽子抛在地上，挤进了高产作物的光荣行列。这是党和广大农民奋战一冬一春的第一个巨大的胜利，第一批丰硕的果实。
    伟大的列宁说过：一个斗争的结束，意味着另一个斗争的开始。党中央和毛泽东同志也经常以不断革命的理论教导我们。现在，争取今年油菜、小麦丰收的斗争胜利地结束了；下一个斗争，争取大秋作物，特别是水稻丰收的斗争又来到我们面前了。我们夺得了油菜和小麦丰收的胜利，更要夺得大秋作物特别是水稻丰收的更大胜利。
    水稻在我国从来就享有高产作物的盛誉。去年，我国水稻平均亩产量达到三百五十多斤的时候，小麦的平均单位产量才只有一百一十多斤。水稻的产量比小麦高出两倍以上。今年，小麦赶上来了，它的单位面积产量和总产量已经不是百分之几、百分之十几的增长，而是百分之几十的增长了。有些省、更多的专区和县、成千上万的农业社甚至已经以一倍、两倍或更高的速度增长了。小麦等夏收粮食作物的总产量比去年增长50％左右。小麦的产量能够如此迅速地增长，素有高产作物盛誉的水稻为什么不能呢？仅以早稻为例，今年我国共种植早稻一亿六千万亩，如果平均亩产量增加50％，由去年的亩产三百多斤增加到五百斤，全国就能收获八百亿斤稻谷，约占去年全国粮食总产量20％以上。争取水稻产量更迅速地增长，对于争取全年农业大丰收，对于全国的社会主义建设和人民生活的改善，具有多么巨大的意义和作用！
    有没有争取水稻产量更迅速地增长的条件呢？我们认为现有的条件很好很够。广大干部有了领导农民争取小麦生产大跃进的经验，很多地区的农民也有水稻栽培的先进经验，认真地总结这些经验，创造性地运用这些经验，就能够促进水稻的大跃进。经过去冬今春的水利建设高潮，今年我国稻田的排灌条件，比以往任何时候都要好，这就为水稻生长创造了十分重要的有利条件。在全民整风胜利的基础上所掀起的农业生产大跃进形势，使今年我国早稻比以往任何一年都插得早、插得密，底肥多，生长旺盛，这就给今年早稻丰收打下了良好的基础。最近期间由于社会主义建设总路线的公布，广大农民的积极性更加高涨，这对于争取水稻丰收是更加有力的推动和鼓舞。只要我们同广大农民更密切地结合在一起，拿出比争取小麦丰收更大的干劲，遇旱抗旱，遇涝防涝，有虫灭虫，有病害除病害，我们就一定能够争取水稻得到比小麦更大的丰收。
    现在，大部地区早稻的收获期还有一个月左右时间，中稻的收获时间还要靠后一些，正是早稻和中稻生长的关键时刻，争取早稻和中稻丰收的斗争还大有可为，只要加强田间管理，作好中耕施肥以及防旱防涝、防治病虫灾害和消灭三类田等工作，我们是一定能够夺得早稻和中稻大丰收的。现在又是其他大秋作物和晚稻播种育秧时期，只要我们在深耕土地、选用良种、施足底肥、实行早播和密植等等方面作得更好，我们也一定能够争取到其他大秋作物和晚稻的大丰收。
    这并不是说争取水稻丰收的斗争中再不会遇到什么困难了。困难仍然是有的。比如，现在大部水稻区正忙着夏收夏种，要加强水稻的田间管理，在劳力上就有困难；如大部肥料已用于小春作物，稻田肥料目前极感不足。另外，还可能发生意想不到的自然灾害。但是，只要我们提早注意，正视困难，大胆放手地发动群众，依靠广大农民的积极性和劳动热情，依靠广大农民的智慧和力量，这一切困难都是能够克服的。
    经过全民整风运动，经过去冬今春的大跃进，经过党的社会主义建设总路线的宣传，经过争取油菜、小麦丰收的斗争实践以后，情绪更加昂扬、经验更加丰富、共产主义觉悟更加提高了的广大农民，既然已经能够在第一个回合中获得胜利，也就一定能够在第二个回合中凯旋。农民群众既然已经使得低产作物的油菜小麦变成高产作物，也就一定能够使本来就是高产作物的水稻获得更大的丰收，以更快的速度增产。
    加油啊，水稻区的农民们！创造更大的奇迹吧，出现更高的纪录吧！
