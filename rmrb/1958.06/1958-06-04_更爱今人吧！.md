Let's Love the People of Today More!
　　Wang Fan
    Recently, from slogans on the walls to newspapers and magazines, some ancient figures such as Huang Zhong, Zhao Yun, Zhuge Liang, and Mu Guiying... have often been used as examples for everyone to learn from, and it has almost become a temporary fashion. These people do have a profound influence among the broad masses of people, and the masses taking them as examples for us to learn from can indeed play a motivating role. However, I always feel that learning from the ancients is necessary, but it is even more important to learn from the people of today.
    The People's Daily editorial on May 4th mentioned that "Most of our party's leaders also made revolution when they were young," which mentioned the people of today. The editorial also said: "The socialist era must produce new people who are suitable for the needs of their era. One characteristic of this new person that distinguishes them from all past heroes and heroines is that their whole body is permeated with the spirit of collectivism, and they have the determination and practical ability to realize the communist ideal." This statement is really excellent. Today, how many heroic figures and heroic deeds have emerged on various fronts! Such as Liu Hulan, Huang Jiguang, such as Wang Chonglun and Hao Jianxiu on the industrial front, such as Wu Yunduo, who is already disabled but still insists on revolutionary work, such as Fang Heming, the old regimental commander of the Red Army... "To count the outstanding figures, we must look at the present," which ancient person can compare with the heroic and noble qualities of these people?
    I propose: the elderly should learn from Fang Heming and Wu Yunduo, the young should learn from Huang Jiguang and Wang Chonglun, and women should learn from Liu Hulan and Hao Jianxiu. We should not belittle the ancients, but love the people of today even more.

### 更爱今人吧！

　　更爱今人吧！
　　王凡
    最近以来，从墙上的标语到报刊杂志上，常常把一些古人如：黄忠、赵云、诸葛亮、穆桂英……作为大家学习的榜样，简直成了一时的风尚。这些人在广大人民群众中确实影响很深，群众拿他们作为我们学习榜样确实能起到激励作用。不过我总觉得学习古人应该，但更应该学习今人。
    人民日报5月4日社论中提到“我们党的大部分领袖也是年轻时候闹革命的”，这就谈到了今人，社论又说：“社会主义时代要产生适合自己时代需要的新人。这种新人区别于过去一切英雄豪杰的一个特色，是全身都浸透着集体主义精神，有为实现共产主义理想的决心和实际本领。”这种提法实在太好了。今天，在各个战线上出现过多少英雄人物和英勇的事迹呀！如刘胡兰、黄继光，如工业战线上的王崇伦、郝建秀、如已经残废仍坚持革命工作的吴运铎、如红军老团长方和明，……“数风流人物还看今朝”，这些人英勇而高贵的品质，有哪个古人比得了？
    我提议：老年人应该学习方和明、吴运铎，青年人应该学习黄继光、王崇伦，妇女们应该学习刘胡兰、郝建秀。我们要不薄古人，更爱今人。
