    Our Factory Has Been Upgraded

    The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party has just concluded victoriously. Our San Sheng He Industrial Mold Trial Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, has been gloriously upgraded to a machine manufacturing factory because we used old lathes to produce a shaper.

    Our factory was originally a small factory with only one hundred and forty-seven workers and simple equipment. In the past, we could only produce simple instruments such as industrial molds and mixers. Recently, after listening to the dissemination of the Party's General Line, we broke with conservative thinking and everyone was determined to be a person who dared to think, dared to speak, and dared to act. At this time, the Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party asked our factory to trial-produce a new type of shaper – a bullhead planer – and to complete it in one week. We bravely accepted this glorious task.

    In order to solve technical problems, on the first day, the factory sent six veteran workers to the Beijing Machine Tool Factory to visit and learn how to manufacture shapers. The next day we began our hard work. Because the equipment was not good, there were many difficulties. Without boring machines and milling machines, we raised the lathe head to replace the boring machine to process the large hole on the large body of the shaper, and converted the lathe into a milling machine or used a planer instead. If there were no tools, we made them ourselves; if there was not enough manpower, we worked day and night. The factory director, the Party branch secretary, and two veteran workers installed a gantry planer temporarily borrowed from outside the factory overnight. Many youth shock team members helped with trial production preparations overnight. In this way, with the hard work of all the factory employees, we finally completed the trial production of the shaper in six and a half days ahead of schedule. On the basis of this victory in hard work, all the factory employees put forward a guarantee to produce three hundred shapers in the second half of this year. Our achievements have received attention from higher authorities, so they announced that our factory would be upgraded from an industrial mold trial factory to a machine manufacturing factory.

    Now, the higher authorities want us to trial-produce a new type of hexagonal lathe. Although this lathe is more complex and precise than the shaper, we are determined to complete this task. Currently, everyone is working hard to complete this new trial production task as soon as possible.

### 我们的工厂升级了

    我们的工厂升级了
    党的“八大”二次会议刚刚胜利闭幕，我们公私合营三盛合工业试模厂因为用破旧车床制成了牛头刨，光荣地升为机器制造厂。
    我厂原是小厂，只有一百四十七个工人，设备简陋，过去只能生产工业试模和搅拌机等简单仪器。最近，我们听了党的总路线的传达，打破保守思想，人人决心要做一个敢想、敢说、敢干的人。这时，中共宣武区委员会要我厂试制一种新式刨床——牛头刨，并且要一星期完成。我们勇敢地接受了这一光荣任务。
    为了解决技术问题，头一天，厂里派了六个老工人去北京机床厂参观、学习制造牛头刨的方法。第二天我们就开始苦战。因为设备不好困难很多，没有镗床和铣床，就把旋床车头垫高代替镗床加工出牛头刨大身上的大眼，把车床改成铣床或用刨床代替，没有工具就动手自做，人力不够就昼夜不停的干。厂长、党支书和两位老工人连夜把从厂外临时借来的龙门刨安装起来。许多青年突击队员连夜帮助做试制准备工作。这样，在全厂职工的苦干下，终于用六天半的时间提前完成了牛头刨的试制任务。在这次苦战胜利的基础上，全厂职工提出了在今年下半年生产三百台牛头刨的保证。我们的成就得到了上级的重视，于是宣布我厂由工业试模厂升级为机器制造厂。
    现在，上级又要我们试制一种新型六角车床。这种车床虽然比牛头刨还要复杂、精密得多，但是我们有决心完成这个任务。目前，大家正鼓足干劲，争取尽早完成这一新的试制任务。
