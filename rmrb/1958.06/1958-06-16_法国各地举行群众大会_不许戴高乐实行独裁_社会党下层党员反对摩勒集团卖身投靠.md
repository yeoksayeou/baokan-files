Xinhua News Agency, June 15th, Paris Dispatch: Mass rallies against fascism and in defense of the republic have continued in many French cities in recent days. At a rally in Tarbes, Upper Pyrenees Department in southern France, attended by four thousand people, the masses warmly welcomed Duclos, Chairman of the French Communist Party Parliamentary Group, who had traveled from afar to participate. People excitedly shouted, "We will never let fascism succeed!" At a rally in Roanne, north of Lyon, Communist Party member Jean Diat called on the masses in his speech to resolutely oppose De Gaulle's implementation of personal dictatorship in the autumn "referendum."

The "Center for the Defense of Freedom and Peace," composed of a number of left-wing republicans, also organized a mass rally in Paris. Former Minister Philip, commentator Matina and others spoke at the meeting. They called on all left-wing forces to unite broadly to counter the conspiracies of the enemies of the Republic.

Among lower-level members of the French Socialist Party, there is growing dissatisfaction with the Mollet-led right-wing leadership group's practice of selling out to De Gaulle and refusing to take united action with left-wing republican forces.

The left-wing minority in the upper echelons of the Socialist Party recently held a meeting at the Mutualité in Paris. Participants enthusiastically supported the suggestion that if the Party Congress cannot be held due to the obstruction of the right-wing leadership group, they will suggest convening a National Congress of the Party. Participants repeatedly shouted "Mollet Get Out!"

In addition, the "Federation of Black African Students in France" issued an appeal to all African people on the 13th, calling on them to protest De Gaulle's rise to power and resist dictatorship. The appeal pointed out that De Gaulle is supported by a group of fanatical colonialists who covet the wealth of the Sahara and Africa.

    法国各地举行群众大会
    不许戴高乐实行独裁
    社会党下层党员反对摩勒集团卖身投靠
    据新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：法国不少城市这几天继续举行反法西斯、保卫共和的群众大会。在法国南部上比利牛斯省塔布市举行的有四千人参加的大会上，群众热烈欢迎远道赶去参加大会的法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛。人们兴奋地高呼“决不让法西斯主义得逞！”。在里昂以北的罗安市举行的大会上，共产党议员让·迪阿在讲话中号召群众在秋天的“全民投票”中坚决反对戴高乐实行个人独裁。
    由若干左翼共和人士组成的“保卫自由与和平中心”也在巴黎组织了一次群众大会。前部长菲利普、政论家马蒂纳和其他人士在大会上讲了话。他们号召一切左翼力量广泛团结起来，反击共和国敌人的阴谋。
    法国社会党下层党员中，越来越不满意以摩勒为首的该党右翼领导集团卖身投靠戴高乐和拒绝同左翼共和力量采取一致行动的作法。
    社会党内上层左翼少数派最近在巴黎互助大厅举行了一次会议。与会者热烈支持这个建议，即：如果党的代表大会由于右翼领导集团的阻挠而不能举行，他们将建议召开党的全国代表会议。与会者还一再高呼“摩勒下台！”
    另外，法国“黑非洲学生联合会”在13日向全体非洲人民发出呼吁，要他们抗议戴高乐上台和反抗独裁。呼吁书指出，戴高乐是受那帮觊觎撒哈拉和非洲的财富的狂热殖民主义分子支持的。
