Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th: High-yield wheat records are frequently reported in Henan Province. In the past two days, two more plots with yields exceeding 3,000 jin per mu have appeared. One is a 1.74 mu high-yield plot in the Sigao Village Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County, north of the Yellow River, with an average yield of 3,259 jin and twelve liang per mu. The other is a 3.025 mu experimental plot in Tongzhuang Village, the eighth team of the second production brigade of the Weixing Agricultural Cooperative in Suiping County, with an average yield of 3,248 jin and fourteen liang per mu.

The characteristics of these two high-yield plots are deep plowing to a depth of seven to nine inches, the selection of the Bima No. 1 improved variety, a seeding rate of 29 to 30 jin per mu, which is twice the seeding rate of ordinary wheat fields, and the use of "set-drill" close planting. The high-yield plot of the Sigao Village Agricultural Cooperative applied eight fertilizers and watered eight times in a timely and rational manner, with a total of 73,000 jin of base fertilizer and top dressing, 30 jin each of chemical fertilizer and bone meal, and seven wind and frost preventions. It did not fall over when hit by a level six wind on May 9th. On May 30th, another level six wind blew, with a rainfall of 90 mm at the same time, and the wheat stalks only tilted 25 degrees. The experimental plot of the Weixing Cooperative had base fertilizer applied three times and top dressing applied three times. In addition to more than 20,000 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer and soil fertilizer, 300 jin of wood ash were also applied. Rice thrips were captured and beaten three times, and frost was prevented twice.

When these two cooperatives harvested, many cadres participated. Cai Zhongtian, Secretary of the Suiping County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chen Bingyin, Deputy Director of the Agricultural and Industrial Department and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Weixing Cooperative of the Chinese Communist Party, specially went to the Weixing Cooperative to participate in the acceptance inspection, weighing, and land measurement.

The members of these two cooperatives praised the good leadership of the Communist Party and the unparalleled superiority of the cooperatives everywhere. Now they are advancing victoriously, preparing to strive for a greater harvest in the autumn. The Sigao Village Agricultural Cooperative proposed: "Plow the land a foot and a half deep, apply 50,000 jin of fertilizer, don't rely on the sky for water, and yield 4,000 jin per mu." They want to create a record of producing 10,000 jin of grain per year in this 1.74 mu high-yield wheat field. The entire cooperative guarantees a double-thousand jin per mu yield for the whole year.

    河南又有两处亩产三千多斤
    深耕密植合理施肥是获得丰产的关键
    新华社郑州15日电　河南省小麦高额丰产纪录频传，最近两天又出现两处亩产三千斤以上的丰产田。一是黄河以北安阳县四高村农业社的一亩七分四厘丰产田，平均亩产三千二百五十九斤又十二两。一是遂平县卫星农业社第二生产大队八小队童庄村的三亩零二厘五试验田，平均亩产三千二百四十八斤又十四两。
    这两处高额丰产的特点是深耕七寸到九寸，精选了碧蚂一号良种，每亩播种量二十九到三十斤，比一般麦田播种量多一倍，并采用了套耧密植。四高村农业社的丰产田适时合理施八肥、浇八水，共上底肥和追肥七万三千斤，化肥、骨粉各三十斤，前后防风防霜七次之多。5月9日六级大风袭击没有倒伏。5月30日又刮六级大风，同时降雨九十公厘，麦株才倾斜二十五度。卫星社的试验田上底肥三次、追肥三次，除了上杂肥、土肥两万多斤外，还上草木灰三百斤。捕打吸浆虫三次，防霜两次。
    这两个社收打的时候，好多干部都参加了。中共遂平县委书记蔡中田、农工部副部长兼中共卫星社党委副书记陈丙寅等特地到卫星社参加了验收过秤和丈量土地。
    这两个社的社员们，到处称赞共产党的领导好，称赞合作社的无比优越性。现在他们乘胜前进，准备争取秋季更大丰收。四高村农业社提出：“地翻尺半，肥上五万，水不靠天，亩产四千。”在这一亩七分四厘小麦高产田里，要创造年产万斤粮的纪录。全社保证全年亩产双千斤。
