　　Organizing Technical Personnel and "Native Experts"
　　Huangzhong Establishes Scientific Research Institution
　　(Our dispatch) Xining – To liberate thought and overcome feelings of inferiority, Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, recently established a comprehensive research leadership organization – the Science and Technology Research Committee. It is organizing technical personnel and "native experts" from all fields to promote the technological revolution on the industrial, agricultural, and pastoral fronts. The committee is headed by Liu Yi, the First Secretary of the CPC Huangzhong County Committee, and includes 27 party and government leaders and experts from industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, and other fields as members. It has seven research groups focusing on agricultural technology, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agricultural and pastoral machinery, chemical fertilizers and chemicals, water conservancy and hydropower, medicine and health, and telecommunications equipment. Technical cadres scattered in various positions, as well as workers, handicraft workers, farmers, and herdsmen with specialized production skills, are participating in the research groups.

　　Currently, the members of the research groups are conducting research on seventy topics within their respective roles, based on the research plan. These topics are aimed at finding scientific and technical solutions to meet the demands of the production leap forward, and the experiences gained will be summarized and promoted immediately so that they can be mastered by the masses and drive the entire production. In addition to comprehensively leading the research work, Secretary Liu Yi has also selected the topic of "Research on Spring Wheat Yield Increase Experience," combining experimental fields and agricultural cooperative production fields to conduct research, and plans to write an article on the research results by the end of the year.

　　Previously, some technical personnel in Huangzhong County were hesitant to conduct experiments. Since the emergence of the technological revolution, with one creation after another from the masses, especially after the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, scientific and technical personnel have been greatly inspired and encouraged. The CPC Huangzhong County Committee has given great importance and support to the positive demands of the masses. (Yang Liben)

　　把技术人员和“土专家”组织起来
    湟中成立科学研究机构
    本报讯　青海省湟中县解放思想，克服自卑心理，于最近成立了综合性的研究工作领导机构——科学技术研究委员会，把各方面的技术人员和“土专家”都组织起来，促进工农牧业战线上的技术革命。委员会由中共湟中县委第一书记柳一任主任，二十七个党政负责同志和工农牧医等方面的内行为委员，下设农业技术、畜牧兽医、农牧机具、化肥化工、水利水电、医药卫生、电讯器材等七个研究组。分散在各个工作岗位上的技术干部和一些在生产技术上有专长的工人、手工业工人、农民、牧民都参加了研究组。
    研究组的组员们目前正根据研究计划，在本职岗位上通过生产对七十个专题进行研究。这些专题都是针对生产跃进的要求，从科学上和技术上来找窍门，找经验，一有成果，就马上总结推广，使它为群众所掌握，推动整个生产。柳一书记除了全面领导研究工作外，还选定了“春小麦增产经验研究”的专题，结合试验田和农业社的生产田作研究，打算在年底写出有关研究结果的文章来。
    以前，湟中县的有些技术人员想做试验都壮不起胆。自从技术革命露头，群众的创造一件接着一件出现，特别是中共八大二次会议以后，使科学技术人员受到很大的启发和鼓舞。中共湟中县委对群众的积极要求，给以很大的重视和支持。　（杨立本）
