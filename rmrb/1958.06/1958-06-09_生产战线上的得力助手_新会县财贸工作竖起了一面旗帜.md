Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th: The finance and trade workers of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, are not only indispensable and capable assistants on the production front, but also create a lot of wealth for society by participating in and organizing production. The county's experience points the direction for rural finance and trade work.

    Xinhui County's finance and trade departments have used methods such as "seeking fertilizer from the ocean, seeking fertilizer from the sky, seeking fertilizer from the ground, seeking fertilizer from the city, and seeking fertilizer from fertilizer (i.e., improving fertilizer efficiency)" to find many new sources of fertilizer in deep mountains, forests, and the ocean, meeting the needs of agricultural production. In the first four months of this year, the county's market towns sent 400,000 dan of fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives.

    Banks frequently go deep into agricultural cooperatives to understand their financial situations and help them arrange funds to solve problems through self-reliance. In order to solve the problem of insufficient pig feed, the Grain Bureau actively produces various feeds and promotes feeding pigs with cow dung. The annual processing of coarse bran powder, grass powder, peanut shell powder, eggshell powder, sweet potato vine powder, and bagasse powder is enough to feed 380,000 pigs.

    The commercial departments have also been very creative in solving the problem of insufficient industrial raw materials. For example, when cement is insufficient, they create burnt clay to replace it; when coal is insufficient, they use peat soil instead; when wood is insufficient, they use bamboo strips instead, etc.

    For commodities that are in short supply in the market, the commercial departments solve the problem according to the principle of "produce what is needed, develop what is lacking." When the supply of native paper is insufficient, the commercial departments organize agricultural cooperatives to increase the production of straw paper using rice straw as raw material; when ramie is insufficient, they grow more than 1,000 mu of ramie themselves; when bricks and tiles are insufficient, they build their own kilns to burn them; when Chinese medicinal materials are insufficient, they help agricultural cooperatives grow medicinal materials. In order to ensure the supply of non-staple foods, they have helped farmers establish 25 production bases for melon seeds, lotus seeds, straw mushrooms, tea, rabbit breeding, and beekeeping. In addition, they have helped agricultural cooperatives establish 27 processing factories, such as ceramic factories, lime kilns, and fertilizer factories. This has changed the face of market supply.

    Commercial departments also use methods such as sending out samples and trial sales to open up sales channels for agricultural and sideline products. The red taro and yam produced in the county have limited sales within the county, so commercial department cadres take samples to various places to find sales channels. For products that are not easy to transport over long distances, the commercial departments process them themselves. In order to adjust surpluses and shortages and prevent stockpiling, they also organize various small commodity exchange meetings within the county. In terms of work style for purchasing, they have shifted from waiting for goods to come to their doors to going deep into the production areas to purchase goods directly.

    Under the leadership of the commercial departments, the county now has 200 peddler teams with more than 2,000 people going to the countryside every day to provide mobile supplies. Barbers also go to the fields and construction sites to work. All stores have simplified sales procedures, extended business hours, and created rotating sales shelves, automatic cloth measuring rulers, and automatic candy dispensers, which have improved work efficiency and convenience for the masses. During the busy farming season, stores also open early markets and night markets, working "from dark to dark" to do business.

    The waste utilization campaign carried out by the commercial departments throughout the county has become a household name. In recent years, commercial departments have organized small vendors to recycle waste products, process and utilize them, adding a total value of 10.96 million yuan, with an average increase in income of more than 50 yuan per household in the county. Through extensive mobilization to utilize waste, almost every brick, tile, stone, grass, tree, and piece of wood in the county is a living treasure. Orange peel, tangerine peel, pine needles, etc., can be used to make oil; lotus root ends, kudzu ends, sweet potato residue, etc., can be used to make sauce; broken bricks and tiles can be used to make large bricks for building houses and paving the ground, etc. This year, the county plans to utilize more than 280 kinds of waste, creating a value equivalent to 100 million jin of rice. In order to make full use of waste, this year, we will also expand and build wild plant oil factories, fiber factories, small ore factories, pigskin factories, rotten fruit factories, and comprehensive waste processing factories. The county has established a Waste Utilization Committee, and districts and towns have established Waste Utilization Stores to vigorously carry out waste product collection, processing, and repair. Various places have also set up home beautification service teams to assist residents in cleaning up waste products and beautifying their homes. These practices have been well received by the masses.

### 生产战线上的得力助手  新会县财贸工作竖起了一面旗帜

　　生产战线上的得力助手
    新会县财贸工作竖起了一面旗帜
    据新华社广州8日电　广东省新会县财贸工作人员不但是生产战线上不可缺少的得力助手，而且因为参预和组织生产，为社会增加了很多财富。这个县的经验是农村财贸工作的方向。
    新会县财贸部门以“向海洋要肥、向天空要肥、向地下要肥、向城市要肥、向肥料要肥（即提高肥效）”等办法，在深山野岭、树林底下和海洋里找到不少新的肥源，满足了农业生产的需要。今年四个月里全县圩镇送给农业社的肥料就有四十万担。
    银行经常深入到农业社了解资金情况，帮助农业社安排资金，自力更生解决问题。粮食局为了解决养猪饲料不足的问题，积极生产各种饲料，推广牛粪喂猪，全年加工的大糠粉、草粉、花生壳粉、蛋壳粉、薯藤粉、蔗渣粉，可以饲养三十八万头猪。
    商业部门在解决工业原材料不足的问题上，也有很多创造。如水泥不足，就创制了烧粘土代替；煤炭不足，就用泥炭土代替；木板不足，就用竹片代替等。
    对于市场供应紧张的商品，商业部门就根据“需要什么，生产什么，缺乏什么，发展什么”的方针来解决。土纸货源不足，商业部门就组织农业社用稻草作原料增产草纸；青麻不足，就自种一千多亩青麻；砖瓦不足，就自己做窑烧制；中药材不足，就帮助农业社种药材。为了保证副食品供应，他们帮助农民建立了瓜子、莲子、草菇、茶叶、养兔、养蜜蜂等二十五种生产基地。此外还帮助农业社建立陶瓷厂、灰窑、肥料厂等二十七个加工厂。这样就改变了市场供应的面貌。
    商业部门还采用寄出样本、试销等办法，为农副产品打开销路。这个县生产的红芋头和大薯，县内销路有限，商业部门干部就带着样本到各地去寻找销路。有些不好远运的产品，商业部门就自己加工。为了调剂有无，防止积压，还在县内组织各种小型商品交流会。在收购工作作风上，他们由过去的等货上门转变为深入产地，上门收购。
    在商业部门的领导下，全县现在每天有两百个货郎队共两千多人下乡流动供应。理发工人也到田间工地去劳动。所有门市部都简化了卖货手续，延长了营业时间，并创造了旋转卖货架、自动卖布尺、自动卖糖器等，提高了工作效率，方便群众。在农忙季节，商店还加开早市、夜市，实行两头黑做买卖。
    商业部门在全县开展的废物利用运动，已做到家喻户晓。几年来商业部门组织小商贩回收废品，加工利用，共增值一千零九十六万元，全县每户平均增加收入五十多元。经过广泛发动利用废物，县里的一砖一瓦一石一草一木几乎都是活财宝。桔皮、橙皮、松叶等可以制油；藕尾、葛尾、薯渣等可以制酱；烂砖瓦可以制大砖盖房子铺地等。今年全县计划利用废物二百八十多种，创造的价值相当一亿斤稻谷。为了充分利用废物，今年还要扩建和新建野生植物油料厂、纤维、小矿石、猪皮、烂果、废品综合等加工厂。县里成立了废品利用委员会，各区、镇成立了废品利用商店，大力开展废品收购、加工修理等工作。各地还设立了美化家庭服务组，协助居民清理废品、美化家庭。这些做法都得到群众的好评。
