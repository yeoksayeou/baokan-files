　　Domestically Produced Bicycles
    Comrade Chen Wenxuan of Xi'an City:
    The People's Daily forwarded your letter inquiring about the quality and price of various bicycles. Based on my daily experience selling bicycles, I will now provide a general introduction to the quality and characteristics of several domestically produced bicycles:
    1.  The "Forever" brand bicycles produced in Shanghai have a durable paint finish that is resistant to chipping and discoloration. The electroplating is wear-resistant and rust-proof, the ride is light and easy, and the style is beautiful, making it most suitable for urban use. The retail price of this bicycle in Beijing is 161.40 yuan per unit.
    2.  The "Flying Pigeon" brand bicycles produced in Tianjin have a longer frame, a larger load capacity, and the frame and parts are strong and durable. They are not only suitable for urban riding but also for carrying goods or for rural use. The retail price of this bicycle in Beijing is 164 yuan per unit.
    3.  The "Production" and "New China" brand bicycles produced in Shanghai have not yet reached the quality of "Forever" and "Flying Pigeon," but their quality has greatly improved recently. The retail prices of the above two types in Beijing are 150 yuan for the "Production" brand and 148 yuan for the "New China" brand.
    4.  The "White Mountain" brand bicycles produced in Shenyang have also improved greatly recently. In particular, after the brakes were changed to band brakes, the braking is more sensitive than before. Although the quality has not yet caught up with "Flying Pigeon" and "Forever," the price is relatively cheap. The retail price of this bicycle in Beijing is 148 yuan per unit.
    Finally, it should be mentioned that after the great leap forward in industrial production, the quality and style of the "Forever" and "Flying Pigeon" brand bicycles have greatly improved, and have caught up with or exceeded the British "Raleigh" brand bicycles. However, because they are only being trial-produced in small batches, they are not yet available in large quantities on the market.

　　国产自行车
    西安市陈文宣同志：
    人民日报转来你询问各种自行车质量价格的来信，现在我根据日常经售自行车的体会，把几种国产自行车的质量和特点，概括地介绍如下：
    1、上海出产的永久牌自行车，烤漆坚固，不易掉漆和变色，电镀耐磨防锈力强，乘骑轻便，样式美观，最适合城市使用。这种车北京零售价格每辆一百六十一元四角。
    2、天津出产的飞鸽牌自行车，车身较长、负荷量大，车身及各部零件坚固耐用，不但适合城市乘骑而且适合载货或农村使用。这种车北京零售价每辆一百六十四元。
    3、上海出产的“生产”、“新华”两种牌子的自行车，质量虽然还没有赶上“永久”和“飞鸽”，但最近质量上也有很大改进。以上两种北京零售价“生产牌”一百五十元，“新华牌”一百四十八元。
    4、沈阳出产的“白山牌”自行车，近来也有很大改进，特别是车闸改为抱闸以后，刹车比以前灵敏，虽然质量还没赶上“飞鸽”和“永久”，但价格比较便宜，这种车北京零售价格每辆一百四十八元。
    最后应该提一下，在工业生产大跃进以后，“永久”牌和“飞鸽”牌自行车的质量和样式，都有了很大的改进，都已赶上或超过英国的“凤头”牌自行车。但因刚试行小批生产，目前在市场上还没有大量供应。
