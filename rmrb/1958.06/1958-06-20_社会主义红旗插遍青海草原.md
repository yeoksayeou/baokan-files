    The Socialist Red Flags Spread Across Qinghai Grasslands
    Liu Zexi, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee
    Laid the Foundation for Socialist Transformation
    "Socialism is heaven, cooperativization is the ladder to heaven, following the Communist Party will never be wrong," this is the praise of socialism by the herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province, and also their high trust in the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It is precisely because of the ardent expectations and warm support of the broad masses of herdsmen that the new situation of socialist transformation of animal husbandry in Qinghai Province has been promoted this year. According to statistics as of the end of May, 1,311 pastoral cooperatives and 221 joint state-private livestock farms have been established in the six autonomous prefectures of the province. The organized herding households account for 34.9% of the total herding households. Among them, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have basically realized pastoral cooperativization. In Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the organized herding households are as high as 96% or more. Even in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where the work foundation is relatively weak, a number of pastoral cooperatives and joint state-private livestock farms have been established on a trial basis. The flowers of socialism – pastoral cooperatives and joint state-private livestock farms – have blossomed all over the Qinghai grasslands.
    In the eight years since liberation, the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee and party organizations at all levels, following the various policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee, have universally established ethnic regional autonomous governments, realized the right of the minority nationalities to be masters of their own affairs; cultivated more than 5,800 minority nationality cadres, developed more than 7,300 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, who play a backbone role in various tasks, and are also the core force for us to realize the socialist transformation of animal husbandry; and have taken various effective measures to vigorously develop animal husbandry production. From the beginning of liberation to the end of last year, the number of livestock of various kinds in the province has increased by one and a half times, and in places where development is fast, it has increased by about ten times. Everywhere presents a joyful scene of "prosperity of both people and livestock." The Party has established close ties with the minority nationality people and enjoys a high prestige among the herdsmen. All of this has laid a good foundation for carrying out the socialist transformation of animal husbandry.
    In 1956, we established 45 pastoral cooperatives and one joint state-private livestock farm on a trial basis. Due to the implementation of unified management, the rational use of labor, the implementation of group grazing, the effective prevention of various natural disasters, the universal promotion of seasonal rotation grazing and the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, they have shown great superiority in production. According to the statistics of 30 cooperatives in 1957, there was an increase in production compared with 1956. Among them, 3 cooperatives increased by more than 200%, 7 cooperatives increased by more than 100%, 8 cooperatives increased by more than 50%, 11 cooperatives increased by more than 20%, and 1 cooperative increased by 17%. Among the 426 members of these cooperatives, 403 households increased their income, accounting for 94.6% of the total number of households.
    The production development of joint state-private livestock farms is also very rapid. Due to the increase in production, the average income of the five pastoral owners who entered the farm in 1956 increased by 21.5% compared with 1955; in 1957, it increased by another 20.54% compared with 1956. The doubts of those who were afraid of transformation before have been eliminated, and they believe in the policies of the Communist Party. Some pastoral owners happily said: "Transformation is not pain, but happiness."
    Due to the great demonstration effect of this batch of cooperatives and farms, many people have seen the benefits of getting organized. Therefore, since last winter, a wave of herdsmen demanding to establish cooperatives has surged. They automatically jointly signed names, concentrated yurts, visited old cooperatives, selected accountants, sought out cooperative cadres, and repeatedly applied to establish cooperatives. The vast majority of pastoral owners also believed that the general trend was irresistible and the popular sentiment was irresistible, and expressed their willingness to accept transformation. They reflected: "Cooperativization is like the morning sun, it will rise even if it doesn't want to, and socialism is like the water in the Yellow River, no one can stop it."
    Boldly and Freely Carry Out the Cooperativization Movement
    Based on the above favorable situation, the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee, at its Second Fifth Plenary Session held in March this year, seriously criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking that existed in the past in dealing with the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, strengthened leadership over pastoral areas, and thus quickly formed a high tide of socialist transformation in pastoral areas. In early May, the Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting of the secretaries of the Party committees of various prefectures and a few county Party committees in Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and decided to further accelerate the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. The meeting determined that in areas where conditions are ripe, it is necessary to boldly and freely carry out the cooperativization movement, and to do it as quickly as possible; in areas where conditions are not yet ripe, efforts should be made to create conditions and strive to realize cooperativization as soon as possible. At the same time, clear provisions were made for some specific issues in the transformation. This further liberated the thinking of cadres, the enthusiasm of the masses was even greater, and the wave of the pastoral cooperativization movement became even more magnificent. In the ten days after the end of the meeting, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture basically realized cooperativization.
    In the pastoral cooperativization movement, all localities have resolutely implemented the class line of "relying on the laboring herdsmen and uniting all forces that can be united," as well as the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit." In the establishment of cooperatives, publicity, preparatory work, and the allocation of cooperative cadres, they resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle herdsmen, especially relying on the poor herdsmen to carry it out, and established the leadership advantage of the poor and lower-middle herdsmen in the pastoral cooperatives. For the pastoral owners, the policy of "uniting, struggling, encouraging, and criticizing" was adopted, and they were actively encouraged and educated to build joint state-private livestock farms. At the same time, some of their wrong words and deeds were exposed and criticized, and they were actively helped to carry out self-transformation. Counter-revolutionary elements who wear ethnic and religious cloaks, use religious activities to spread rumors and sabotage, incite a few backward elements, and attempt to resist socialist transformation were resolutely given severe blows and punishments.
    According to the principle of "peaceful transformation," the transformation of the pastoral owners' economy was carried out in the form of joint state-private operation. Livestock entering the farm was implemented by the method of "discounting and calculating shares, and distributing dividends according to shares." At the same time, they were given due consideration in all aspects. The pastoral owners entering the farm generally served as members of the farm affairs management committee, and some served as farm directors or deputy farm directors after consultation and election. The state only sends cadres to lead, and generally does not make investments. Their family members can, according to their own wishes, participate in labor within the farm on a priority basis, and are given reasonable wages in the same way as other herdsmen. Sufficient convenience is also provided in terms of using livestock and normal religious activities. Appropriate handling was also given to the "sacred animals" referred to by the herdsmen, allowing them to enter the cooperative or farm, or be entrusted to the cooperative or farm for grazing, and respecting their historical customs.
    A Production Upsurge Has Been Set Off on the Grassland
    The purpose of implementing socialist transformation is to liberate the productive forces and develop production. At the same time as the upsurge of pastoral cooperativization appeared, an unprecedented production upsurge was set off in various places. Herdsmen working happily and tensely can be seen everywhere on the grassland. They broke with old conventions, worked day and night to deliver young livestock, built water conservancy projects, irrigated grasslands, reclaimed wasteland for farming, prevented disasters, eliminated pests, and prepared materials for settlement. According to incomplete statistics as of late May, the lamb survival rate in various autonomous prefectures this year generally reached about 90%, which is 15%-20% higher than last year; 507 channels have now been built, more than 60 dams have been built, 27 water storage ponds have been repaired, and more than 150 wells and springs have been dug, irrigating nearly 3 million mu of grassland; more than 100,000 harmful animals of various kinds have been eliminated; and the grain planted in many areas this year can reach self-sufficiency. It is estimated that the number of livestock of various kinds in the province this year will increase by more than 14% on the basis of 17.17 million heads last year, and it is entirely possible to overfulfill the task of 19.58 million heads.
    At present, there are two main tasks before us: one is to firmly grasp the key measures such as water and grass, disaster prevention, improvement, and settlement, and to do a good job in production to achieve a great leap in production; the other is to continue to push the pastoral cooperativization to a climax, strive to achieve cooperativization as soon as possible, and comprehensively do a good job in the rectification and consolidation of the established cooperatives and farms. Because the time we established cooperatives and farms is short, the speed is fast, and the work is generally done more roughly, many problems remain to be solved carefully in the future. Therefore, we must, in the spirit of unity and mutual benefit, and according to the conditions, freely mobilize the masses, carry out great liberalization, great contention, and great debate, clarify right and wrong, and on the basis of educating and improving the political awareness of the broad masses of herdsmen of all ethnic groups, continue to deal with the remaining problems in the establishment of cooperatives and farms, clear livestock and livestock shares, appropriately merge groups, rationally organize the use of labor, and gradually realize piece-rate wages and management systems including output quotas. Implement the policy of "running cooperatives democratically" and "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," implement the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and actively develop diversified operations, in order to achieve the purpose of increasing production and increasing income.

    社会主义红旗插遍青海草原
    中共青海省委农村工作部部长　刘泽西
    打下了社会主义改造的基础
    “社会主义是天堂，合作化是天梯，跟着共产党走，永远不会错”，这是青海省各族牧民对社会主义的赞歌，也是他们对共产党、毛主席的崇高信任。正是由于广大牧民群众的这种殷切期望和热烈拥护，便促成了青海省今年畜牧业社会主义改造的崭新局面。截至5月底的统计，全省六个自治州已办起一千三百一十一个牧业合作社和二百二十一个公私合营牧场。组织起来的牧户占总牧户的34.9％。其中海北藏族自治州，海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治州，海南藏族自治州已经基本上实现了牧业合作化。海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治州组织起来的牧户高达96％以上。就连工作基础较差的果洛藏族自治州，也已试办了一批牧业合作社和公私合营牧场。社会主义的花朵——牧业合作社和公私合营牧场——已经开遍了青海草原。
    解放八年来，中共青海省委和各级党组织，遵循党中央的各项方针政策，普遍建立了民族区域自治政权，实现了少数民族人民当家作主的权利；培养了少数民族干部五千八百多人，发展了七千三百多名共产党员和共青团员，他们在各项工作中起着骨干作用，也是我们实现畜牧业社会主义改造的核心力量；并且采取了各项有效措施，大力发展了畜牧业生产。从解放初到去年年底，全省各种牲畜增加了一倍半，发展快的地方增加了十倍左右，到处呈现着“人畜两旺”的欢乐景象。党和少数民族人民建立了密切的联系，在牧民群众中有了崇高的威信。所有这些，就给进行畜牧业社会主义改造打下了良好的基础。
    1956年，我们试办了四十五个牧业合作社和一个公私合营牧场。由于实行了统一经营，合理使用了劳力，实行了分群放牧，有效地防御了各种自然灾害，普遍推行了四季轮牧和农牧结合，因而在生产上显示了巨大的优越性。据三十个社1957年的统计，比1956年都有增产。其中增产200％以上的三个社，100％以上的七个社，50％以上的八个社，20％以上的十一个社，17％的一个社。在这些社的四百二十六户社员中，增加收入的就有四百零三户，占总户数的94.6％。
    公私合营牧场生产发展也非常迅速。由于生产增加了，入场的五户牧主1956年比1955年平均收入增加了21.5％；1957年比1956年又增加了20.54％。以前害怕改造的人疑虑消除了，相信了共产党的政策。有的牧主高兴地说：“改造不是痛苦，而是幸福”。
    由于这批社、场的巨大示范作用，很多人看到了组织起来的好处。因此，去冬以来，要求办社的牧民风起云涌。他们自动联名，集中帐房，访问老社，选择会计，物色社干，再三申请办社，绝大部分牧主也都认为大势所趋，人心所向，表示愿意接受改造。他们反映说：“合作化像早上的太阳不升也得升，社会主义像黄河里的水谁也挡不住”。
    大胆放手开展合作化运动
    根据上述有利形势，中共青海省委在今年3月间召开的二届五次扩大会议上，严肃批判了已往在对待畜牧业社会主义改造上存在的右倾保守思想，加强了对牧业区的领导，因而很快地便在牧业区形成了一个社会主义改造的高潮。5月上旬省委又在海南藏族自治州召开了牧业区各州委书记和少数县委书记的现场会议，决定进一步加速对畜牧业的社会主义改造。会议确定，凡是条件成熟的地区，必须大胆放手开展合作化运动，能快就快；凡是条件尚不成熟的地区，应该努力创造条件，争取尽早实现合作化。同时对改造中的一些具体问题作了明确规定。进而解放了干部思想，群众的劲头更足，牧业合作化运动的波澜也就更加汹涌壮阔了。在会议结束后的十多天，海北藏族自治州和海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治州就基本上实现了合作化。
    在牧业合作化运动中，各地都坚决贯彻执行了“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可以团结的力量”的阶级路线，以及“自愿互利”的原则，在建社宣传、准备工作以及社干的配备上，都坚决依靠了贫苦牧民和中等牧民，特别是依靠了贫苦牧民去进行，在牧业社中树立了贫苦牧民的领导优势。对于牧主则采取了“又团结，又斗争，又鼓励，又批评”的政策，积极鼓励教育他们兴建公私合营牧场，同时对他们中的一些错误言行进行了揭发和批判，积极帮助他们进行自我改造。对披着民族、宗教外衣，利用宗教活动，进行造谣破坏，煽惑少数落后分子，企图抗拒社会主义改造的反革命分子，坚决给以严厉的打击和惩办。
    根据“和平改造”的方针，对于牧主经济的改造，采取了公私合营的方式。牲畜入场实行“折价计股，按股分红”的办法。同时在各方面给了他们应有的照顾。入场牧主一般都担任了场务管理委员会的委员，有的经过协商、推选，担任了场长或副场厂。国家只派干部领导，一般不作投资。他们的家属，根据自愿，可以优先参加场内劳动，同样按其他放牧员给予合理的工资。在支用牲畜和正常的宗教活动等方面，也都给予充分的方便。对牧民群众所称的“神畜”也作了适当的处理，允许入社、入场或交社、场代放，并尊重他们历史上的风俗习惯。
    草原上掀起了生产高潮
    实行社会主义改造的目的，就是为了解放生产力，发展生产。在牧业合作化高潮出现的同时，各地都掀起了空前未有的生产高潮。草原上到处可以看到愉快而紧张劳动的牧民。他们打破陈规旧习，夜以继日地接产幼畜，兴修水利，灌溉草原，开荒种地，防灾灭害和备料定居。截至5月下旬的不完全统计，各自治州羔羊成活率，今年一般达90％左右，比去年高15％—20％；现已兴修渠道五百零七条，筑坝六十多座，修涝池二十七个，打井挖泉一百五十多眼，灌溉草原近三百万亩；消灭各种害兽十万多头；不少地区今年种植的粮食就可达到自给自足。预计今年全省各种牲畜在去年一千七百一十七万头的基础上，增加14％以上，超额完成一千九百五十八万头的任务是完全可能的。
    目前，摆在我们面前的任务主要有两条：一是必须紧紧抓住水草、防灾、改良、定居等关键性的措施，确实搞好生产，实现生产大跃进；二是继续把牧业合作化推向高潮，争取早日实现合作化，并全面做好已建社、场的整顿巩固工作。由于我们建社、建场的时间短，速度快，工作一般做的比较粗糙，许多问题还有待于今后继续认真解决。因此，我们必须本着团结互利的原则，根据条件，放手发动群众，开展大放大鸣大辩论，辩明是非，在教育提高各族广大牧民群众政治认识的基础上，继续处理建社、建场中的遗留问题，清理牲畜和畜股，适时合群，合理组织使用劳力，逐步实现按件计酬和包括包产等管理制度。贯彻执行“民主办社”、“勤俭办社”的方针，实行农牧结合，积极开展多种经营，以期达到增加生产、增加收入的目的。
