Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. American prisoners, Reverend R.B. Geren and Wallace F. Weaver, were released by our governing authorities on the 14th after serving their sentences. They left our country on the 19th from Shanghai aboard the British ship "Changsha". Five years ago, Geren was arrested in Shanghai on June 15, 1953, for collecting military, political, and economic intelligence in our country under the guise of missionary work and engaging in espionage activities. Weaver was arrested on the same day for undermining our country's financial regulations. Both were sentenced to five years' imprisonment according to the law.
