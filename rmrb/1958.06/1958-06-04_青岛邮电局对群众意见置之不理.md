Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau Disregards Public Opinion

　　After the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau cancelled the door-to-door subscription fee collection method in April of last year, subscribers found it very inconvenient. Many subscribers did not have time to pay the fees, and had to stop subscribing to newspapers and periodicals, which reduced the circulation of newspapers and periodicals. The Cangkou District Post and Telecommunications Bureau of Qingdao City alone reduced its circulation by more than 3,000 copies. Later, someone suggested in the newspaper that the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau restore the door-to-door fee collection method, but they ignored it. Later, I wrote to them directly, but they still ignored it. In March of this year, I wrote to the Qingdao Daily suggesting that the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau consider restoring the door-to-door fee collection method during the rectification upsurge. The Qingdao Daily replied that my letter had been forwarded to the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau for processing; however, two months have passed, and there has not even been a reply. From this incident, it is not difficult to see that the Qingdao Post and Telecommunications Bureau has a very weak mass viewpoint. It is suggested that they thoroughly burn away this bureaucratic air during this rectification.

### 青岛邮电局对群众意见置之不理

　　青岛邮电局对群众意见置之不理
    去年4月份，青岛市邮电局取消了订阅报刊上门收费的办法后，订户感到很不方便。许多订户没有时间去交费，不得不停止订阅报刊，因而使报刊发行数量降低了。仅青岛市沧口区邮电局，就减少发行量三千多份。后来有人在报上建议青岛市邮电局恢复上门收费的办法，但是他们没有理。后来我又直接给他们去信，他们仍然置之不理。今年3月，我又给青岛日报去信建议青岛市邮电局在整改高潮期间考虑恢复上门收费的办法，青岛日报回信说已把我的信转给青岛市邮电局处理了；但为时已过两个月，至今连一个回信也没有。从这件事不难看出青岛市邮电局的群众观点是十分薄弱的。建议他们在这次整改中，要狠狠地烧掉这种官气。
