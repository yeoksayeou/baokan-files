Those Who Play with Fire Are Bound to Get Burned
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The armed struggle of the Lebanese people against imperialism and its agents has entered its sixth week. Recently, the insurgent people not only defeated multiple offensives by the Chamoun government's forces, but also launched an offensive from central Lebanon towards Beirut. Simultaneously, fierce fighting also erupted between the insurgent people and government forces within Beirut. In the fighting, the Chamoun government's Ministry of Defense, Ramileh Prison, the Presidential Palace, and the residence of Prime Minister Solh were all fiercely attacked. Solh fled in panic, barely escaping with his life. This fully demonstrates the powerful strength of the insurgent people, so much so that even Solh himself exclaimed that the government forces could no longer "control the situation."

Under the blows of the patriotic Lebanese people, the pro-Western government headed by Chamoun has fallen into isolation. Because the policies implemented by this government have lost all popular support, even within its own ranks, signs of desertion and betrayal have begun to emerge. Many government officials, including ministers, diplomats, senior military officers, and judges, have successively submitted their resignations. Incidents of government soldiers mutinying on the battlefield and joining the ranks of the insurgent people's forces are also common. However, the ruling clique headed by Chamoun not only refuses to step down but is instead acting perversely. Recently, it announced the dissolution of three opposition parties and ordered "conscription" in preparation for stubborn resistance. But when the broad masses of the people throughout the country have risen up in arms to fight the Chamoun government, what use can these reactionary measures be?

The reason why the Chamoun government can be so vicious is simply because it has the backing of American and British imperialism. From the moment the Lebanese people launched their uprising, imperialism has carried out all sorts of interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. They have continuously sent large quantities of weapons to the Chamoun authorities and dispatched military personnel to assist government forces in attacking the Lebanese people. Recently, they discovered that doing only this was not enough to subdue the heroic Lebanese people, so they are preparing to carry out even more rampant armed intervention. According to Western press reports, the US and British authorities have already drafted a detailed plan for armed intervention in Lebanon and reached an "agreement" during the Macmillan-Eisenhower talks. According to this plan, the US Sixth Fleet's Marine Corps will land in Beirut, and US and British paratroopers will occupy southern Lebanon. The United States will take charge of the intervention operation, while Britain is willing to act as an accomplice. On June 15th and 16th, US President Eisenhower discussed the Lebanese situation with Dulles and Twining for several days in a row. According to Agence France-Presse, the US plan is to send troops to land in Lebanon as long as the Lebanese government makes a "request" or the government is overthrown. According to a report in the British "Daily Mail" on June 16th, the US authorities have issued new orders to the US Sixth Fleet stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean, preparing to take "emergency action."

In order to create a pretext for its intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs, the United States has adopted the tactic of a thief crying "stop thief." It instructed the Lebanese authorities to falsely accuse the United Arab Republic before the UN Security Council of interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs, which is part of this conspiracy. Under the activity of the United States, the Security Council has decided to send an observation committee to Lebanon to stop the so-called "illegal infiltration of personnel or the transport of weapons or other materials across the border." However, if the observation committee really came for this purpose, then they should stop the behavior of the US, Britain, and their puppet states from transporting large quantities of weapons into Lebanon and dispatching large numbers of military personnel into Lebanon. Some of these weapons have already been seized by the Lebanese insurgent people, which is a well-known fact. But now the observation committee wants to avoid this issue and carry out other activities, which makes it very clear that the so-called observation committee is just a tool to cover up US and British intervention.

The United States also intends to use the Baghdad Pact countries as a vanguard. Jordanian and Iraqi soldiers and officers have long secretly and in batches joined the Chamoun army to suppress the Lebanese insurgent people. Under the direction of the United States, a Lebanon-Iraq-Jordan "defense" treaty is being actively brewed. In addition, Western newspapers have also revealed that Chamoun's representatives even participated in the Baghdad Pact group's military conference held not long ago, and together with the United States, Britain and other countries, studied the issue of using the Baghdad Pact countries' troops to suppress the Lebanese insurgent people on a large scale.

However, whether the United States uses the United Nations or the Baghdad Pact, whether it uses the pretext of the Chamoun government's "request" or any changes within Lebanon, it is illegal for it to carry out armed intervention in Lebanon. Any event that occurs in Lebanon is Lebanon's internal affair. The Lebanese people have every right to oppose the Chamoun government, which violates national interests, and have every right to take action to defend the independence of their country. No matter what banner the United States and its followers use to invade Lebanon, it will be naked aggression!

The current situation in Lebanon is not only the focus of the struggle between the Middle Eastern people and imperialism but also the focus of the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war. The heroic Lebanese people are fighting to protect national independence and also to defend peace. Therefore, peace-loving people from all countries in the world stand on the side of the Lebanese people. Peace is indivisible. The peace of Lebanon and the Middle East is threatened, and so is world peace. The world's forces for peace will mobilize and, together with the Lebanese people, shatter the dangerous plan of the United States and its followers to play with fire in Lebanon. Now is an era when the forces of peace are unprecedentedly strong, and the East wind has prevailed over the West wind. No matter in which region of the world, if imperialism dares to provoke peace, they will be completely defeated. Those who play with fire are bound to get burned! This is our warning to imperialism.

    玩火者必自焚
    本报评论员
    黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义及其代理人的武装斗争，已经进入第六周。最近，起义人民不但击败了夏蒙政府军队的多次进攻，而且从黎巴嫩中部向贝鲁特发动了攻势。同时，在贝鲁特市内，起义人民同政府军队也发生激战。在战斗中，夏蒙政府的国防部、拉米勒监狱、总统官邸以及总理索勒哈的住宅都遭到猛烈攻击。索勒哈仓惶出走，仅以身免。这充分显示了起义人民的强大威力，因此连索勒哈本人也惊呼政府军队已不能“控制局势”了。
    在黎巴嫩爱国人民的打击下，以夏蒙为首的亲西方政府已经陷于孤立地位。由于这个政府所执行的政策丧尽人心，甚至在它的内部也开始出现众叛亲离的现象，包括部长、外交官、高级军官、法官等许多政府官员，先后提出了辞职。政府士兵临阵哗变倒戈，参加起义人民部队的事件，也是屡见不鲜。但是，以夏蒙为首的统治集团不但仍然不肯下台，反而倒行逆施，最近竟宣布解散三个反对党，并下令“征兵”，准备顽抗。可是，当全国广大人民都揭竿而起同夏蒙政府作战的时候，这些反动措施又能有什么用呢？
    夏蒙政府所以能够这样穷凶极恶，只是由于它有美英帝国主义在后边撑腰。从黎巴嫩人民发动起义的时候起，帝国主义就对黎巴嫩内政进行了种种干涉。他们把大批的武器源源不断地送给夏蒙当局，并且派遣了军事人员协助政府军队进攻黎巴嫩人民。最近他们发现，仅仅这样做还不能够压服英勇的黎巴嫩人民，于是他们就准备进行更猖狂的武装干涉。据西方报刊透露，美英两国当局已经拟就了一套武装干涉黎巴嫩的详细计划，并在麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔的会谈中达成了“协议”。根据这个计划，美国第六舰队的海军陆战队将在贝鲁特登陆；美英两国伞兵，将占领黎巴嫩南部。美国担任干涉行动的指挥，而英国则甘愿充当帮凶。6月15日和16日，美国总统艾森豪威尔又连日同杜勒斯和特文宁讨论黎巴嫩局势。据法新社说，美国的打算是，只要黎巴嫩政府提出“请求”或者这个政府被推翻，美国就要派兵在黎巴嫩登陆。又据英国“每日邮报”6月16日报道，美国当局已向美国驻地中海东部的第六舰队发出新的命令，准备采取“紧急行动”。
    美国为了给它干涉黎巴嫩内政制造借口，采取了贼喊捉贼的办法。它指使黎巴嫩当局向联合国安理会诬告阿拉伯联合共和国干涉黎巴嫩内政，就是这个阴谋的一部分。在美国的活动下，安理会已经决定派一个观察委员会到黎巴嫩，来制止所谓“边境有人员非法渗入或将武器或其他物资运入”。但是，观察委员会果真是为此而来，那么他们就应该制止美英及其仆从国家把大批武器运进黎巴嫩并派遣大批军事人员进入黎巴嫩的行为。这些武器，有的已被黎巴嫩起义人民所缴获，这是人所共知的事实。可是现在观察委员会却想避开这个问题，而去进行别的活动，这就使人很清楚地看出，所谓观察委员会不过是掩盖美英干涉的一个工具。
    美国也打算利用巴格达条约国家担当打先锋的角色。约旦、伊拉克士兵和军官早已秘密地、分批地参加了夏蒙军队，镇压黎巴嫩起义人民。在美国导演下，一个黎巴嫩—伊拉克—约旦“防御”条约正在积极酝酿中。另外，西方报刊还透露，夏蒙代表竟参加了不久以前举行的巴格达条约集团的军事会议，和美英等国一起研究利用巴格达条约国家军队大规模镇压黎巴嫩起义人民的问题。
    但是，美国不论是利用联合国，还是利用巴格达条约，不论是借口夏蒙政府的“请求”，还是借口黎巴嫩内部的任何变化，它要想对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，都是非法的。黎巴嫩国内发生的任何事件，都是黎巴嫩的内政。黎巴嫩人民完全有权利反对违反民族利益的夏蒙政府，完全有权利采取行动来卫护自己国家的独立。美国及其追随者不论打着什么样的旗帜侵犯黎巴嫩，都将是赤裸裸的侵略！
    目前的黎巴嫩局势，不但是中东人民和帝国主义之间的斗争焦点，而且也是和平力量与战争势力之间的一个斗争焦点。英勇的黎巴嫩人民正为保护民族独立而战，也正为保卫和平而战。因此，世界各国爱好和平人民都站在黎巴嫩人民这一边。和平是不可分割的。黎巴嫩和中东的和平受到了威胁，也就是世界和平受到了威胁。世界和平力量将会动员起来，同黎巴嫩人民一起，粉碎美国及其追随者在黎巴嫩玩火的危险计划。现在是和平力量空前强大，东风已经压倒西风的时代，不论在世界上的任何地区，帝国主义如果胆敢向和平挑衅，他们都要彻底失败。玩火者必自焚！这就是我们对帝国主义的警告。
