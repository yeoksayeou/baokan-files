    "Frank" Confession
    Sawada Renzo, the Japanese representative of the Kishi Nobusuke government attending the "Japan-South Korea Talks," openly stated that strengthening "cooperation" with the Syngman Rhee group and "pushing the current 38th parallel to the Yalu River" is the Japanese government's "diplomatic mission." As a confession of the Kishi Nobusuke government's undying imperialist ambitions, this is quite "frank." However, when questioned in the Diet, he hemmed and hawed, saying that the "wording was inappropriate" and needed to be "corrected."
    Whether it is "corrected" or not, the Kishi Nobusuke government's self-positioning as a running dog of the United States and its harboring of imperialist ambitions towards Asian countries is "Sima Zhao's heart, known to all." It is absolutely certain that the Kishi Nobusuke government's following the United States and stepping up the revival of militarism will only bring greater disasters to the Japanese people, leading to a more miserable defeat than in 1945.

### “坦率”的供状

    “坦率”的供状
    出席“日韩会谈”的日本岸信介政府代表泽田廉三公然说：加强同李承晚集团“合作”，“把目前的三八分界线推进到鸭绿江边”是日本政府的“外交任务”。作为岸信介政府帝国主义野心未死的供状，这倒是很“坦率”的。但是在国会上一碰到质询，他却支吾其词，又说什么“措词有不妥当的地方”，要加以“更正”了。
    “更正”也好，不更正也好，岸信介政府以美国的走卒自居，对亚洲各国抱着帝国主义野心，原是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”的；而岸信介政府跟在美国后面，加紧复活军国主义，只能给日本人民带来更大的灾难，导向比1945年更惨的失败，则是绝对无疑的。
