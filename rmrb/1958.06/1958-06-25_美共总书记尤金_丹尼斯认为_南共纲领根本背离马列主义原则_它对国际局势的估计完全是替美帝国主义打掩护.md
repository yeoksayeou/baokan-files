Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: New York Dispatch: The American Communist Party's organ, "Worker's Weekly," published an article on June 15th entitled: "Dennis's Opinions on the Yugoslav Program." The article introduced American Communist Party General Secretary Eugene Dennis's critique of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The article begins by stating: In a recent report to the National Executive Committee of the American Communist Party on several aspects of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Eugene Dennis emphasized that the views of the Yugoslav Communists are contrary to the position adopted by the American Communist Party.

The article says: Dennis pointed out that since he made a preliminary assessment to the National Executive Committee two weeks ago based on news dispatches, the third part of the Yugoslav program concerning "International Political Relations" is now available in the United States. Therefore, his report to the National Executive Committee meeting on May 19th mainly discussed this part. He first sharply criticized the main points of the Yugoslav program. His summary of conclusions includes the following:

	The Soviet Union Firmly Pursues a Policy of Peace
	Tensions are Created by the United States

I. Dennis said that the fatal weakness of the erroneous position of the Yugoslav Communists lies in their non-Marxist assessment of the international situation. The Yugoslav program almost completely obscures the responsibility of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, for the root causes of world tensions. It says that "two opposing military-political blocs" bear equal responsibility for the arms race and the danger of war.

Furthermore, the Yugoslav program believes that the Soviet Union's "Stalinist" foreign policy is responsible for the creation of two opposing military-political blocs. It also insists that the roots of current international conflicts and divisions can be found in the great power agreements signed in Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam. The fact, of course, is that because the Soviet Union resolutely implemented socialist policies, these agreements provided a common basis for the continued united action of the anti-Axis alliance in the post-war period to seek stable peace. These agreements stipulated the reunification, demilitarization, and elimination of Nazism in Germany, and the establishment of democratic and independent states in Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania.

The fact is that the "Cold War" occurred in 1946-47 due to the United States and its junior partners, Britain and France, violating these three great powers agreements on peace, democracy, and national freedom.

Dennis further pointed out that the Yugoslav program asserts that the Soviet Union's post-war foreign policy is based on "hegemonistic politics" and the struggle for "spheres of influence." The Yugoslavs ignore the facts that the Soviet Union firmly pursues a policy of peace, as evidenced by: the Soviet Union's initiative to abolish its past military bases in Finland and Lushunkou, reduce its armed forces, unilaterally suspend nuclear weapons testing, and propose numerous suggestions on declaring nuclear weapons illegal, establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Europe, and holding summit meetings to resolve all international disputes through peaceful negotiations.

Dennis pointed out that, unfortunately, the Yugoslav Communist leadership declared that Yugoslavia would practice "neutrality" between the two absolutely opposed world systems and camps of socialism and capitalism. They mistakenly equated these two camps, believing that they should be equally responsible for the "Cold War." Furthermore, the Yugoslav leaders said that they would rely on the U.S.-controlled United Nations as the main fortress for striving to achieve world peace.

Dennis said that the Sixteenth National Congress of the American Communist Party had already rejected this non-Marxist view of the international situation, previously proposed first by Stachel, and later by Clark and Gates.

For example, in the main political resolution adopted by the Congress, the section entitled "Striving for Peaceful Coexistence and Ending the Cold War" emphasized the following point: "Shortly after the end of World War II, the large corporations that controlled American political and economic life began to try to expand their control to the rest of the world. They caused our government to abandon President Roosevelt's policy of U.S.-Soviet friendship and the three great powers' unity for peace... Monopoly capitalists replaced these policies with atomic bomb diplomacy, military alliances, war bases, and active interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Under the pretext of 'defending' the illusory 'Soviet threat,' they established a highly profitable arms economy at home.

"...Although the imperialists were able to launch an aggression against Egypt, the power of the forces of peace—the Soviet Union, China, the people's democracies, the Bandung nations, and the peaceful sentiments of the people in the United States and other major capitalist countries—was able to quickly stop this aggression. Although the imperialists interfered in the tragedy of Hungary, they did not dare to take the opportunity to carry out open, large-scale military intervention.

"...Although they (the imperialists) do not dare to launch any major war in the current situation, they have been trying to change this balance of world power. They do this in various ways, especially by trying to split the socialist world or weaken the socialist countries."

	Similar to the Views of Gates and Others in the South
	Vainly Attempting to Belittle the Soviet Union

II. Dennis drew people's attention to the fact that neither in Tito's speech at the Congress nor in the third part of the Yugoslav program was there any mention of Yugoslavia belonging to the socialist camp that exists today in the Soviet Union, People's China, and the people's democracies. Tito and his program both demanded a "higher" loyalty, that is, loyalty to the "universal efforts" of workers with socialist ideas in various countries.

They vaguely put forward this argument in order to justify—according to the South Communist leaders—that it is legitimate not to cooperate with different socialist countries in international affairs and in organizing economic, political, and cultural cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries.

Dennis pointed out that here, one is also reminded that Stachel, Gates, and Clark held similar views. They declared their loyalty to some abstract "socialism," but they did not take an active, clear attitude towards the socialist reality that exists today. They belittled and diminished the epoch-making significance of the Soviet Union and socialism appearing as a world system.

III. Dennis said that another error of the Yugoslav program seems to lie in its one-sided emphasis on the national characteristics of a certain country. Because it puts the national conditions affecting the process of socialist development in Yugoslavia in such a position that it negates the international experience and lessons to be drawn from the general laws of socialist revolution and construction, especially negating the main role played by the Soviet Union in building socialism, ensuring the victory of socialist construction, and paving the way for socialism to appear as a world system—thereby enabling Yugoslavia, like other Eastern European countries, to obtain the prerequisites for achieving national independence and social development.

In addition, the Yugoslav communists deny the historical role of the Soviet Union, deny the undeniable fact that the socialist camp (which decisively affects the development of the international situation) has emerged, they vainly and arrogantly attempt to export "national communism," and try to put forward the views and experiences of Yugoslavia as "modern" and "best" methods for other countries to transition to "socialism"!

	The American Communist Party Takes Marxism-Leninism as a Guide
	Its Position is Completely Different from that of the South Communist Party

IV. Dennis further pointed out that the leaders of the Yugoslav Party have also drawn other conclusions that contradict the most basic realities of life and the principles of Marxism-Leninism. For example, according to this program, the dictatorship of the proletariat in socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, inevitably leads to "state centralism, bureaucracy, and social conflict." At the same time, this program believes that the accelerated development of state monopoly capitalism in the United States, Britain, and France is paving the way for capitalism to "evolve" into socialism! The program claims that in the West, especially in the United States, there is no need for a Marxist-Leninist vanguard party, and even says that the trade unions here are the leaders of the working class and will become the vanguard on the road to socialism. Dennis said that this would surprise many people—and also surprise American Marxists.

Dennis emphasized that the Sixteenth National Congress of the American Communist Party adopted a clear position on this issue. The Congress rejected similar views put forward by Gates, Clark, and others who attempted to abolish the Communist Party. Because the Congress declared that the primary task of the American Communist Party is to establish and strengthen the Communist Party as the socialist party of the American working class, a vanguard party guided by the science of Marxism-Leninism.

Dennis summarized that the Yugoslav program shows that the leaders of the Yugoslav Communists have fundamentally departed from the principles of Marxism-Leninism on some basic issues. The Yugoslav program is revisionist in nature and stands alone in direct contradiction to the opinions of the Communist and Workers' Parties contained in the Declaration of the Twelve Parties and the Peace Declaration of the Sixty-four Parties published last November, and the Yugoslav position is also completely different from the main position adopted by the American Communist Party at its last Congress.

Dennis finally pointed out that although the current political and ideological differences between the Marxist-Leninist parties of Eastern and Western countries and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are essentially the same and equally sharp as the differences that existed between 1948 and 1955—however, the methods of debating and dealing with these differences now are significantly different from the methods of treating previous discords and differences.

Dennis said that what path the Yugoslav leadership may take in terms of cooperation with the socialist family, or in terms of treating the not-so-altruistic "aid" from the United States and the issue of the Balkan "powder keg"—remains to be seen, but various signs indicate that "danger lies ahead."

### 美共总书记尤金·丹尼斯认为  南共纲领根本背离马列主义原则  它对国际局势的估计完全是替美帝国主义打掩护

    美共总书记尤金·丹尼斯认为
    南共纲领根本背离马列主义原则
    它对国际局势的估计完全是替美帝国主义打掩护
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党机关报“工人周刊”6月15日刊登了一篇文章，题目是：“丹尼斯关于南斯拉夫纲领的意见”。文章介绍了美国共产党总书记尤金·丹尼斯对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的批判。
    文章首先说：在最近就南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领的几个方面向美国共产党全国执行委员会提出的报告中，尤金·丹尼斯着重指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者的观点是同美国共产党所采取的立场相反的。
    文章说：丹尼斯指出，自从他在两星期以前根据新闻电讯向全国执行委员会作出初步估计以来，现在在美国已经可以得到南斯拉夫纲领中关于“国际政治关系”的第三部分了。因此，他要在全国执行委员会5月19日的会议上作的报告主要谈这一部分。他首先尖锐地批评南斯拉夫的纲领的主要论点。他的结论摘要包括下列几点：
    苏联坚决奉行和平政策
    紧张局势是美国造成的
    一，丹尼斯说，南斯拉夫共产主义者的错误立场的致命弱点在于他们对国际局势所作的非马克思主义的估计。南斯拉夫的纲领几乎完全掩饰了帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义对造成世界紧张局势的根源的责任。它说，“两个敌对军事政治集团”对军备竞赛和战争的危险负有相等的责任。
    此外，南斯拉夫的纲领认为，苏联的“斯大林主义”外交政策要对造成两个敌对的军事政治集团负责。它还硬说，目前国际冲突和分裂的根源可以在德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦签订的大国协定中找到。事实当然是，由于苏联坚决执行社会主义的政策，这些协定提供了共同的基础，使反轴心联盟的统一行动在战后时期继续下去，以寻求稳定的和平。这些协定规定德国重新统一、非军事化和消灭纳粹主义，规定在波兰、保加利亚和罗马尼亚建立民主的和独立自主的国家。
    事实是，“冷战”是在1946—47年由于美国和它的低级伙伴英国和法国一些违反这些关于和平、民主和民族自由的三大国协定而发生的。
    丹尼斯进一步指出，南斯拉夫的纲领断言，苏联在战后时期的外交政策是以“霸权政治”和争取“势力范围”的斗争为基础的。南斯拉夫人忽视了苏联坚决奉行和平政策的种种事实，这些事实表现在：苏联主动取消它过去在芬兰和旅顺口的军事基地，裁减它的武装部队，单方面地停止核武器试验，以及提出关于宣布核武器为非法、在中欧建立无原子武器地区和关于举行最高级会议用和平谈判的方法解决一切国际争端的许多建议。
    丹尼斯指出，不幸，南斯拉夫共产党领导方面宣布南斯拉夫在社会主义和资本主义这两个绝对相反的世界体系和阵营之间实行“中立”，他们错误地把这两个阵营相提并论，认为它们应该同样对“冷战”负责。此外，南斯拉夫领导人说，他们将依靠美国控制的联合国作为争取实现世界和平的主要堡垒。
    丹尼斯说，美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会已经拒绝过去先由斯塔罗宾、后来又由克拉克和盖茨提出的这种对国际局势的非马克思主义观点。
    例如，在代表大会所通过的主要政治决议中题为“争取和平共处和结束冷战”的那部分着重指出了下面这一点：“在第二次世界大战结束后不久，控制着美国政治经济生活的大公司就着手设法把它们的控制扩大到世界的其余地区。它们使我们的政府抛弃了罗斯福总统的美苏友好和三大国为和平而团结一致的政策……垄断资本家以原子弹外交、军事联盟、战争基地和积极干涉其他国家内政的作法代替了这些政策。他们在“防御”空想的“苏联威胁”借口下在国内建立了一种非常有利可图的军备经济。
    “……虽然帝国主义者能够对埃及发动侵略，但是和平力量——苏联、中国、人民民主国家、万隆国家以及美国和其他主要资本主义国家的人民的和平情绪——的力量却能够很快地制止这种侵略。虽然帝国主义者干涉了匈牙利的悲剧，但是他们不敢乘此机会进行公开的、大规模的军事干涉。
    “……虽然他们（帝国主义者）不敢在目前情况下发动任何大战，但是他们一直在设法改变世界力量的这种对比。他们用各种方法特别是用试图分裂社会主义世界或削弱社会主义国家的办法来做到这一点。”
    南共同盖茨等观点相似
    妄自尊大力图贬低苏联
    二，丹尼斯提请人们注意这样一个事实：无论铁托在代表大会上所发表的演说中或者南斯拉夫纲领第三部分中都丝毫没有说南斯拉夫是属于今天在苏联、人民中国和人民民主国家存在的社会主义阵营的。铁托和他的纲领都要求要有一种“较高的”忠诚，即忠于各国有社会主义思想的工人们“普遍进行的努力”。
    他们含糊地提出这个论点，以便证明——据南共领导人说——在国际事务方面和在组织社会主义国家之间的经济、政治和文化合作和互助方面不同社会主义国家进行合作是正当的。
    丹尼斯指出，这里，人们也想起斯塔罗宾、盖茨和克拉克持有类似的见解，他们宣布他们忠于某种抽象的“社会主义”，但是他们对今天所存在的社会主义现实却并不采取积极的、明确的态度，他们轻视和贬低苏联和社会主义作为一个世界体系而出现这一事实的划时代的意义。
    三，丹尼斯说，南斯拉夫纲领的另一个错误之点看来在于它片面强调某一个国家的民族特点。因为它把影响南斯拉夫社会主义发展进程的民族条件放在这样一个地位，以致否定了要从社会主义革命和建设的一般规律中得出的国际经验和教训，特别是否定了苏联在建设社会主义、保证社会主义建设的胜利和为社会主义作为一个世界体系出现铺平道路——因而使南斯拉夫像其它东欧国家一样能够得到取得民族独立和社会发展的先决条件——方面所起的主要作用。
    此外，南斯拉夫共产主义者否认苏联的历史作用，否认社会主义阵营（它决定性地影响着国际局势的发展）已经出现这一无可争辩的事实，他们妄自尊大地试图输出“民族共产主义”，并且试图把南斯拉夫的观点和经验作为其它各国向“社会主义”过渡的“现代的”和“最好的”方法提出来！
    美共以马列主义为指针
    它同南共立场截然不同
    四，丹尼斯进一步指出，南斯拉夫党的领导还得出另外一些同生活的最基本的现实、同马克思列宁主义的原则相矛盾的结论。例如，据这项纲领断言，社会主义国家，特别是苏联的无产阶级专政不可避免地导致“国家集权主义、官僚主义和社会冲突”。同时，这项纲领认为美国、英国和法国的国家垄断资本主义的加速发展在为资本主义“演变地长入”社会主义铺平道路！纲领声称，在西方，特别是在美国，一个马克思列宁主义的先锋党没有什么必要，竟说这里的工会是工人阶级的领导者，并且将成为走向社会主义的道路上的先锋队。丹尼斯说，这会使很多人感到意外——同样也使美国马克思主义者感到意外。
    丹尼斯着重指出，美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会在这个问题上采取了明确的立场。代表大会拒绝了企图取消共产党的盖茨、克拉克和其他人所提出的类似的观点。因为代表大会宣布，美国共产党的首要任务是建立和加强共产党，作为美国工人阶级的社会主义政党，一个以马克思列宁主义科学为指南的先锋党。
    丹尼斯概括说，南斯拉夫的纲领表明，南斯拉夫共产主义者的领导在一些基本问题上，从根本上离开了马克思列宁主义的原则，南斯拉夫纲领在性质上是修正主义的而且孤零零地同去年11月发表的十二个党的宣言和六十四个党的和平宣言中包含的各国共产党和工人党的意见直接矛盾，而且南斯拉夫的立场也是同美国共产党在它上一次代表大会上所采取的主要立场截然不同的。
    丹尼斯最后指出，虽然东西方国家的马克思列宁主义的政党同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间目前政治上和意识形态上的分歧和从1948年到1955年之间存在的分歧本质上相同而且同样尖锐——但是现在辩论和处理这些分歧的方法同对待以前的不和及分歧的方法有显著的不同。
    丹尼斯说，南斯拉夫的领导在同社会主义国家大家庭的合作方面，或是在对待美国的不那么大公无私的“援助”方面和在巴尔干“火药库”问题上到底可能走什么道路——仍旧要等着看，但是，各种迹象都指明“前面有危险”。
