    What Kind of Person Was Judas?
    Question: In Comrade Boda's article "American Imperialism's Gamble in Yugoslavia" published in the second issue of "Red Flag" magazine, it is written: "For the imperialists, Tito is certainly more valuable than Judas." The People's Daily on the 27th published an editorial from the Australian Communist Party's "Tribune" weekly, which believes that comparing Tito to Judas is correct. May I ask, what kind of person was Judas?

    Answer: Judas was a traitor who betrayed Jesus, as recorded in Chapter 22 of the Gospel of Luke in the Bible. The Bible says that Judas was one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. The rulers were jealous of Jesus and plotted to kill him. However, Jesus and his disciples preached together, and the rulers could not recognize which one was Jesus. If a betrayer could not be found among Jesus' disciples, the rulers' plan to kill Jesus would be difficult to achieve. Later, the rulers finally found Judas among Jesus' disciples, and the rulers offered thirty pieces of silver for Judas to hand Jesus over. Judas agreed. He agreed with the rulers that Judas would kiss Jesus as a sign when arresting Jesus to identify the one who was Jesus. Because of Judas' betrayal, Jesus was arrested and killed. This story has since been widely used to refer to shameful acts of betrayal and treason.

    犹大是怎样一个人？
    问：伯达同志在第二期“红旗”杂志上发表的“美帝国主义在南斯拉夫的赌注”一文中写道：“对帝国主义者说来，铁托当然要比犹大值钱”。27日人民日报刊载了澳共“论坛”周报的社论，这篇社论认为把铁托比作犹大是对的。请问犹大是怎样一个人？

    答：犹大是圣经路加福音第二十二章所记载的出卖耶稣的一个叛徒。圣经说，犹大本是耶稣十二门徒里的一个。统治者忌恨耶稣，阴谋加以杀害。但是，耶稣和门徒一起传教，统治者认不得那一个是耶稣。如果不能从耶稣门徒中找到一个出卖者，统治者杀害耶稣的计划是难以得逞的。后来，统治者终于在耶稣门徒中找到了犹大，统治者以三十个银币的代价，要犹大把耶稣交出来。犹大应允了。他同统治者约定：在逮捕耶稣时由犹大以吻耶稣为记，指证那个是耶稣。由于犹大的出卖，耶稣被捕并被杀害了。这个故事，后来被广泛地用来比喻可耻的出卖和叛变行为。
