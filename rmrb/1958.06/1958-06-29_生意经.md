    "Business Acumen"
    Britain and the United States have been vying to sign agreements with the six-nation Western European atomic energy joint venture organization regarding the construction of atomic power plants. Although the efficiency of American atomic power plants is much lower than that of British atomic power plants, and the cost of power generation is much higher, the first batch of $350 million contracts was snatched away by the United States.
    Why is this? It turns out that the reason the United States made this deal is that it promised to provide the Western European atomic energy joint venture organization countries with more than $100 million in long-term loans. In the words of relevant British sources, this is relying on "financial enticement."
    Of course, Britain is not unaware of the method of expanding exports through financial means. The problem is that Britain does not have the money to do so. Not long ago, when Macmillan went to Washington to meet with Eisenhower, he shouted the slogan of "economic interdependence," aiming to get a sum of money from the United States to improve Britain's foreign trade; as a result, he gained nothing and returned empty-handed. Now, the signing of the contract for the construction of atomic power plants for the Western European atomic energy joint venture organization countries has further shattered the British Prime Minister's wishful thinking. Facts have proven that what the bosses in Washington are interested in is using their money as "financial enticement" to snatch away the deals that Britain is about to get, and definitely not using their money to help Britain improve its position in international trade.

    “生意经”
    英国和美国一直争着要和西欧六国的原子能联营组织签订关于建造原子发电站的协定。虽然美国的原子发电站比起英国的原子发电站来效能要差得多，发电成本要高得多，可是第一批三亿五千万美元的合同却被美国抢走了。
    这是为什么呢？原来，美国做成这笔买卖的原因是，它答应提供西欧原子能联营组织国家一亿多美元的长期贷款。用英国有关人士的话来说，这是依靠“财政上的引诱”。
    当然，用财政手段来扩大输出的办法，英国并非不知道。问题不过是英国没有钱那样做。不久前麦克米伦到华盛顿去和艾森豪威尔会谈时高喊“经济上互相依赖”的口号，目的就是想从美国搞到一笔钱来改善英国的对外贸易；结果他是一无所得，空手而归。现在，为西欧原子能联营组织国家承建原子发电站的合同的签订情况，更进一步粉碎了英国首相的痴心妄想。事实证明，华盛顿的老板感兴趣的只是用他们的钱作为“财政上的引诱”来把英国眼看可以到手的买卖抢走，而决不是用他们的钱来帮助英国改善在国际贸易中的地位。
