Double-Season Grapes
　　Jie Tingyong
　　After I was sure about the existence of double-season grapes, I asked many people: "Have you heard of grapes that can bear fruit twice a year?" They all replied in surprise: "Is there such a thing?"
　　Double-season grapes are produced in the Jiujiang Army Hospital in Jiangxi Province, cultivated by Lieutenant Colonel You Quanju, the director of this hospital. You Quanju's hometown is Shen County, Hebei Province, which is rich in fruits. You Quanju has been interested in horticulture since childhood, and still is today. Since he was transferred to Jiujiang Army Hospital, he has been constantly collecting famous fruit trees from all over the country in his spare time and planting them on the barren hills of about twenty or thirty mu north of the hospital. After several years of operation, it is now full of Shenzhou honey peaches, Henan apricots, Tianjin pears, and Liaoning apples. Double-season grapes are also planted here. Why is he so enthusiastic about horticultural work? As he himself said: The wounded and sick need a beautiful environment. If they lie in bed, open the window, and see green trees, red flowers, and smell the fragrance of fruits, how much they need it! With an orchard, they can also enjoy the shade under the grape trellis in the hot summer. In the autumn harvest season, they can also eat the freshest fruits.
　　The varieties of double-season grapes include Purple Rose, Red Rose, and White Rose. Although they are called "Three-Season Grapes" in You Quanju's hometown, they only yield one crop a year there. In the spring of 1955, he inserted grape branches brought back from his hometown into the soil, and in 1956 they bore fruit, but they were not very ripe.
　　In 1957, the grapes were fully ripe, blooming in March, and by the end of July, sweet and delicious grapes were eaten. Unexpectedly, less than half a month after harvesting this crop, clusters of small flowers bloomed again on these branches. In November, the second crop of grapes ripened again, with the same size and taste as the previous crop, but the yield was a little lower. According to their calculations, the total yield of the two crops is more than 7,000 jin per mu.
　　Now the double-season grapes planted in this hospital have expanded from the original one hundred to five hundred. This spring, the Jiujiang Prefectural Office, Jiujiang Silkworm Farm, and Yunshan, Wushan, and Maoshan Tou farms have all obtained seedlings of double-season grapes. These units are preparing to further promote this variety.

    双季葡萄
  　解廷勇
    当我确实知道有双季葡萄的事情以后，曾经问过很多人：“你们听说过葡萄一年能结两次果实吗？”他们都惊奇的回答：“有这种事？”
    双季葡萄产在江西省九江市陆军医院里，是这个医院院长游全举中校栽培的。游全举的家乡在河北深县，盛产水果。游全举从幼年时代起就对园艺感到兴趣，直到现在还是这样。自从他调到九江陆军医院任职开始，不断地利用业余时间搜集全国著名的果树，栽植在靠医院北面的大约有二、三十亩面积的荒山岗。经过几年的经营，这里现在已经布满深州蜜桃、河南杏、天津鸭梨和辽宁苹果。双季葡萄也栽在这里。他为什么这样热心园艺工作呢？正如他自己所说：伤病员们需要幽美环境，如果他们躺在病床上，打开窗子，就可以看到绿树、红花和闻到果香，对他们是多么需要呀！有了果园，炎热的夏天他们还可以到葡萄架下乘乘凉。秋收季节，他们还可以吃到最新鲜的水果。
    双季葡萄的品种有紫玫瑰，也有红玫瑰和白玫瑰。在游全举家乡虽然叫它们为“三季葡萄”，但是在那里每年只收一季。1955年春天，他把从家乡带回来的葡萄枝条扦插在土里，1956年就结了果，但不很成熟。
    1957年葡萄完全成熟了，3月开花，7月底就吃到了香甜可口的葡萄。不料收完这季葡萄不到半个月，这些枝条上又开了一串串的小花，11月第二季葡萄又成熟了，颗粒、味道同前一季的完全一样，只是产量低了一点。根据他们计算，两季葡萄的总产量，每亩有七千多斤。
    现在这个医院栽种的双季葡萄由原来的一百棵扩大到五百棵。今年春天，九江专署、九江蚕场和云山、雾山、毛山头等农场都要到了双季葡萄的秧藤。这些单位准备进一步推广这个品种。
