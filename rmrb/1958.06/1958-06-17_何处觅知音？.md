    Where to Find a Soulmate?
    Jiang Zhi Shui

    Recently, reading the newspapers, I learned that some painters, although having experienced eight or nine years of life after liberation, remain as they were, still thinking that having talent can determine everything. They consider themselves as literati and refined scholars of the old society, feeling incomparably aloof. Participating in politics or using art to serve politics would be lowering their dignity. They believe that workers, peasants, and soldiers do not understand art and are not soulmates. One painter felt that his works were "high-class" and only a few people understood them, so he inevitably felt a bit "lonely," but he still "plans to paint for a few friends, enough if they like it." (See "Fine Arts" No. 5) There are also painters who deliberately create crude and shoddy works when painting for workers, peasants, and soldiers, thinking that they won't understand whether the painting is good or bad anyway. It is said that a unit ordered a batch of paintings from the Chinese Painting Cooperative, intending to give them to the peasants, but the painters were unwilling to sign their names on them, believing that it would lower their status. How can people who hold this view talk about praising socialism? And how can they consciously serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    What kind of soulmate are they looking for anyway? The exploiting classes in the old society used the money they obtained from exploiting the working people to play with antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, which were used to decorate their empty and ugly souls. At that time, the real working people had no right to appreciate art. This was precisely the tragedy of a conscientious artist in the old society. Historically, countless artists have been saddened for life because they could not find a true soulmate. Are our artists still taking the rewards of these exploiting classes as their life's purpose?

    If the soulmate is a "refined scholar and man of letters" like oneself, with whom one can indulge in self-admiration, then there are no such people today. Moreover, what kind of sentiment is this kind of person?

    In fact, as long as you shift your position, you can find soulmates everywhere.

    This matter is also recorded in the fifth issue of "Fine Arts." Six painters in Tianjin held an exhibition, and in a few days, more than 5,000 people visited. In order to allow the workers to buy them, the price of each painting did not exceed five jiao. More than 230 paintings of flowers, landscapes, and insects were sold out in less than two days. Many people rushed to see and order paintings right after work, and those ordering paintings lined up. Some workers were too busy and asked their children or others to order on their behalf with their membership cards... One of the six painters said: "Workers, peasants, and soldiers not only love painting, but also understand painting and like to buy paintings. ...As long as the colors are bright and the taste is healthy, they are quickly ordered. They don't like works with dull colors or those that simply pursue the interest of ink and brush."

    Are not these enthusiastic art connoisseurs and workers who so cherish the labor of artists the rare soulmates for painters? Could any famous painter in the old days feel this inner joy of serving the workers?

    More importantly, the workers pointed out that an important shortcoming in their creation was the insufficient expression of realistic themes. This opinion is really to the point and hits the nail on the head. Socialism has opened up infinite roads for the prosperity of art. It is not difficult to find a soulmate. As long as you put down your aloof airs, abandon the reins of fame and wealth, and let your works directly meet the working people, when you find a soulmate and feel the greatest pleasure of serving them, you will naturally be willing to enthusiastically praise them.

    何处觅知音？
    江之水
    最近看报，得知有些画家虽然经过了八九年的解放后的生活，可是依然故我，仍以为有了本领即可决定一切，自以旧社会的文人、雅士自居，觉得自己清高无比。若是参予政治或以艺术为政治服务，就是降低了品格，他们认为工农兵不懂艺术，不是知音。一位画家觉得自己的作品是“高级”的，只有几个人了解，不免感到有点“孤单”，但他还是“打算就为几个朋友画画，他们能喜欢就够了。”（见“美术”第五期）还有的画家，为工农兵作画时，就故意粗制滥造，以为画得好坏反正他们也不懂。据说有一个单位向国画合作社订了一批画，准备送给农民，画家们竟不愿在上面署名，认为那样就降低了身份。持有这种观点的人，谈得上什么歌颂社会主义？又怎么能自觉地为工农兵服务呢！
    他们寻找的究竟是什么样的知音呢？旧社会的剥削阶级拿着剥削劳动人民得来的钱，把玩些古董字画之类，是用来打扮他们那空虚和丑恶的灵魂的。那时，真正的劳动人民是无权欣赏艺术的。这正是旧社会一个有良心的艺术家的悲哀所在，历史上不知有多少艺术家因找不到真正的知音而悲愤终生，难道我们的艺术家还在以这些剥削阶级的赏赐为自己的生活目的吗？
    如果知音是同自己一样的“雅士墨客”，彼此可以自我陶醉，那么今天也已经没有这种人了，况且这种人又是一种什么样的情趣呢？
    其实，只要把立场一挪，到处都是知音。
    这事也在第五期“美术”上记载着，天津的六位画家开了个展览会，几天之内参观的就有五千多人，他们为了让工人群众能买，每幅画售价不超出五角，二百三十余幅花卉、山水、草虫不到两天就被订购一空。许多人刚下班就赶来看画、订画，订画的都排了队，有的工人因为忙把会员证交给自己的孩子和托别人代订……。六位画家中的一位说：“工农兵不但爱画，而且懂画，喜欢买画。……只要色调鲜艳，趣味健康的都很快订出去，凡是色调灰暗或单纯追求墨情笔趣的作品，他们就不喜欢。”
    这些热情的艺术鉴赏家和如此珍贵艺术家劳动的工人们，不正是画家们难得的知音吗？旧时代的任何一位有名的画家能够感受到这种为工人服务的内心的愉快吗？
    更重要的，是工人们都指出他们在创作上存在的重要缺点是表现现实题材不够。这意见真是一针见血，正好击中要害。社会主义给艺术的繁荣开辟了无限的道路，要想找到知音是不难的，只要放下清高的架子，抛弃名利的缰绳，让自己的作品直接与劳动人民见面，当你找到了知音并感受到为他们服务的最大乐趣的时候，就不期而然地愿意热情地歌颂他们了。
