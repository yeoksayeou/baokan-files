　　A Historical Account of the Grand Canal
　　Zhifei
    The headline in the People's Daily on May 17th: "Opening Up the North-South Grand Canal, Connecting Five Major Rivers," this massive project has already started ahead of schedule, and now hundreds of thousands of laborers are working simultaneously on three sections along the Grand Canal. When the project is completed in the future, most of China will be able to communicate by boat, and it will be possible to travel directly from Beijing to Hangzhou by steamship; grain from the southwest can be transported to Beijing by waterway. This news is so inspiring that we would like to briefly discuss the evolution of the old Grand Canal.
    The earliest canal was a ditch dug by the states of Chu and Wu in the early sixth century BC. Later, King Fucha of Wu wanted to become the leader of the Central Plains, so he connected the waterways of the Si and Ji rivers between Shandong and Henan. Southerners opened a canal in the north, and from then on, the technology of canal excavation was passed on to the north. In the early Warring States period, the state of Wei moved its capital to Kaifeng and dug a canal connecting the Yellow River and the Bian and Ji rivers, which is the famous "Honggou" in history. Later, the Chu-Han Contention used this canal as a boundary.
    After the Qin and Han dynasties, the rulers had a more comprehensive plan and system center for the excavation of canals. The unification of the Sui Dynasty came after a long period of division during the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties. The area south of the Yangtze and Huai rivers had been developed by southward migration into the most economically and culturally developed region in the country. How to strengthen control over the wealthy areas of the south became a major issue for the unified regime established in the Central Plains; at the same time, due to defense considerations, a large military base needed to be established in Zhuojun (now Beijing) in the northeast of the country. How to transport the military supplies of the whole country to this large base was another major issue for the rulers at that time. The rivers in China all run from west to east. Emperor Yang of Sui excavated the Grand Canal to connect the transverse waters, forming a river that runs through the north and south, the purpose of which was to solve the above two problems.
    Emperor Yang of Sui built the Grand Canal in several sections: In the north, he built the Tongji Canal to connect the Luo, Yellow, and Huai rivers; south of the Huai River, he re-excavated the ancient Han Canal to connect the Yangtze and Huai rivers; south of the Yangtze River, he opened a Jiangnan River, passing through the Taihu Lake basin and reaching Hangzhou on the Qiantang River, thus closely linking the Central Plains and the Jianghuai region.
    The canal system of the Sui Dynasty was multi-branched, with Luoyang, the capital, as the center, connecting the Guanzhong Plain in the west, the North China Plain in the north, and the Taihu Lake basin in the south, and the scope of navigation greatly exceeded the past. The Grand Canal opened by Emperor Yang of Sui could pass dragon boats with four-story buildings that were 200 feet long and 45 feet high, and its depth and width can be imagined. The excavation of this canal played a significant role in the economic and cultural development of China's north and south in the future.
    The Tang and Song dynasties indeed enjoyed the benefits of the Grand Canal, but over time, the riverbed gradually silted up, and some places even rose above the ground, which required spending a lot of money every year and conscripting thousands of laborers to work on dike repairs and dredging. The Southern Song Dynasty established its capital in Hangzhou, and the area north and south of the Huai River belonged to the Song and Jin regimes respectively. Since it was not used for grain transport, the rulers allowed it to silt up, and many river sections in the north became land routes at that time.
    The Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties excavated another system of canals, which is the Grand Canal shown on today's general maps. From the Yuan Dynasty, the capital was no longer in the Central Plains but in Beijing, so there was no need to open the canal to the Central Plains again. It was enough to connect Beijing, the political and military center, with Jiangnan, where wealth and taxes came from. Therefore, the canal channel became a single line in the eastern part of China, no longer going west, and the imbalance in the development of various regions in the country became more serious.
    The Yuan Dynasty restored this canal, basically following the old route. At that time, there were still several sections that could be navigated: south of the Huai River, the Han Canal and the Jiangnan River were intact; north across the Huai River, one could trace the Si River to Shandong; in Hebei, the Wei and Bai rivers converged in Tianjin. The entire line lacked only a large section of about 400 li between the Si and Wei rivers in Shandong, and a small section of 50 li between Beijing's Tongzhou and the capital. Therefore, the Jizhou River (Jining) and the Huitong River (south of Linqing) were opened to connect the Si and Wei rivers, and grain transport reached Tongzhou directly. Also, water from the Changping rivers west of Beijing was introduced into Beijing's Jishuitan, and flowed eastward to Tongzhou into the Bai River. The Grand Canal of the Yuan Dynasty was fully navigable. However, these two sections of the canal were high in terrain and steep in slope, and the water flow relied entirely on the regulation of dams. The project was huge and maintenance was especially difficult. Although a miracle was created under the planning of the great hydraulic engineer Guo Shoujing, and it was unobstructed for a generation, it eventually could not carry heavy loads due to its narrow banks and shallow water. Therefore, most of the grain for the Yuan Dynasty had to be transported north by sea at great risk.
    Before moving the capital to Beijing, the Ming Dynasty first dredged the Grand Canal. The problem was still in the large section in Shandong. The Ming Dynasty learned from the experiences and lessons of the Yuan Dynasty and introduced the Wen River into the Nanwang Lake between the Si and Wei rivers. Nanwang Lake was the highest in terrain, known as the "water ridge," and from there it diverged north and south. North to Linqing for 300 li and south to Xuzhou for 390 li, dams were built to block the water. It took five years to complete, and navigation was greatly improved.
    Therefore, the Grand Canal was initiated in the Yuan Dynasty, and it was successfully completed in the Ming Dynasty. However, the section from Tongzhou to Beijing had been abandoned for a long time. Although the Ming and Qing dynasties repeatedly started construction to restore it, they never restored the old appearance of the Yuan Dynasty. At most, it could only reach outside Beijing. The Grand Canal after the Ming Dynasty actually ended at Tongzhou.
    The main task of the Grand Canal was to transport grain from the south to the north, referred to as grain transport. People often call the Grand Canal the Grain Transport River. The Ming and Qing dynasties also established a Grand Canal Governor-General to manage grain transport affairs. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, maritime steamship transportation had risen, and north-south transportation was becoming increasingly frequent. Grain was either transported by sea or converted into cash, and grain transport was gradually stopped. Once grain transport ceased, the canal from north of the Yellow River to Linqing soon silted up into flat land, and the riverbed became farmland and villages. After the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was built, the Grand Canal lost its effectiveness even more.
    The world-famous Suez Canal is about 160 kilometers long; the Panama Canal is only more than 80 kilometers long, while our Grand Canal, straightening the old bends, is more than 1,500 kilometers long, making it the longest canal in the world.

　　运河史话
　　知非
    5月17日人民日报的头条新闻：“打通南北运河、联结五大河流”，这一巨大工程已经提前开始，现在有几十万民工在运河沿线的三个地段同时施工。将来工程完竣以后，使大半个中国可以互通舟楫，从北京坐轮船可以直达杭州；西南的粮食可以由水路运到北京。这条消息太振奋人心了，因此我们想简单地谈一谈旧运河的沿革。
    最早的运河是公元前六世纪初楚国和吴国所开的沟渠，后来吴王夫差要做中原的盟主，在山东、河南之间接通了泗水和济水的航运，南方人在北方开了运河，从此开凿运河的技术，才传到了北方。战国初年，魏国把国都迁到开封，开凿了一条连接黄河及汴、济诸水的运河，这就是历史上有名的“鸿沟”。后来楚汉相争，即以这条运河为界。
    秦、汉以后，统治者对于运河的开凿，更有了通盘计划和系统中心。隋朝的统一，是经过了魏、晋南北朝长期的分裂，江淮以南，已被南下移民开发成为国内经济、文化最发达的地区。如何加强对南方富庶地区的控制，便成为建立在中原的统一政权的大问题；同时因为国防的关系，在国境的东北部涿郡（今北京）需要建立一个军事上的大据点。如何把全国的军需物资输送到这个大据点，又是当时统治者的另一个大问题。中国的河流，都是由西往东，隋炀帝开运河，便是要将横贯诸水联系起来，成为贯通南北的河流，目的就是为了要解决上面这两个问题。
    隋炀帝修筑运河，分为数段举行：在北方修通济渠沟通洛水、黄河、淮水；自淮以南，重新复开古时的邗沟，沟通江淮；在长江以南，开了一条江南河，穿过太湖流域，直达钱塘江边杭州，于是把中原和江淮紧密地联系起来。
    隋朝的运河系统是多枝形的，以京都洛阳为中心，西通关中盆地，北抵华北平原，南达太湖流域，通航的范围，大大超过以往。隋炀帝所开的运河，都可以通行长二百尺高四十五尺的四层楼的龙舟，其深广可以想见。这条运河的开凿，对于以后中国南北的经济、文化各方面的发展，都起了很大的作用。
    唐、宋两代，确实享受了运河之利，但时间久了，河底逐渐填淤，有些地方甚至高出平地，这就需要每年花很多的钱，征发成千上万的民伕来作修堤浚淤的工作。南宋建都杭州，淮河南北分属宋、金两个政权，既不为漕运所经，统治者也就听其淤塞，在北方的许多河身，遂成了当时的陆行大道。
    元、明、清三朝又开凿了另一系统的运河，即现今一般地图上所画的那条大运河，从元朝起，首都已不在中原而在北京，就无需乎再把运河开向中原，只要把政治、军事重心的北京和财赋所出的江南联系起来就够了。因此运河河道变成了偏在中国东部的一条单线形，不再向西去，于是国内各地区发展的不平衡，也就更趋严重。
    元朝复修这条运河，基本上是沿袭旧道，在当时还有若干段可以通航：自淮以南，邗沟和江南河，完好未坏；逾淮而北，可溯泗水到达山东；河北境内有卫河、白河交会于天津。全线独缺山东境内泗、卫之间约四百里一大段，北京通州之间五十里一小段没有河道。于是开济州河（济宁）、会通河（临清南）沟通泗、卫两水，漕运直达通州。又引京西昌平诸水入北京积水潭，东出至通州入白河，元朝的大运河，遂全线通航。可是这两段运道，地势高，坡度大，水流全靠建闸节制，工程既巨、维持尤难，虽然在伟大的水利工程学家郭守敬的规划之下，创造了奇迹，一代通行无阻，但终因岸狭水浅，不能载重，故元朝的大部分漕粮，只得冒大风险由海道北运。
    明朝在末迁都北京以前，先疏浚运河，问题还是在山东境内这一大段。明朝吸取了元朝的经验教训，把汶水引入泗卫之间的南旺湖，南旺湖地势最高，号称“水脊”，自此向南北分流，北至临清三百里，南至徐州三百九十里，都筑闸拦水，修建了五年才完工，航运大畅。
    所以大运河是创始于元，至明朝始告成功。但通州至北京一段，因堙废已久，明清两代虽屡次兴工修复，却始终没有恢复元朝的旧观，最多只能通到北京城外。明以后的大运河，实际上是以通州为终点。
    运河的主要任务是南粮北运，简称漕运，一般人常把运河叫作运粮河，明清两朝并设一漕运总督，专管运粮的事务。到了清末，海上轮船运输已经兴起，南北交通日盛，漕粮或由海运，或改折现金，后来逐渐停止漕运。漕运既停，从黄河北至临清的运河，不久即全部淤成平地，河底变成了耕地和村庄。津浦铁路修成后，运河更失去了它的效用。
    世界有名的苏彝士运河，全长约一百六十多公里；巴拿马运河才八十多公里，而我们的运河，把旧来的湾道取直，还有一千五百多公里，可算是世界上最长的一条运河。
