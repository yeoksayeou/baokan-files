    Hubei People Determined Not to Let a Single Rice Seedling Die of Drought
    Shandong Accelerates Water Conservancy Construction in Drought Resistance

    (Our Dispatch) Under the impetus and inspiration of the general line of socialist construction, the peasant masses of Hubei Province, having already achieved a great summer harvest, are now engaged in a tenacious struggle against the drought to ensure an even greater autumn harvest. To date, millions of people throughout the province have been投入into this struggle, voicing the resounding slogan: "Do not let a single seedling die of drought, do not let a single rice shoot die of drought!"

    From the end of May to the beginning of June, most areas of Hubei Province experienced varying degrees of drought due to prolonged lack of rain. In some areas, the drought-affected area accounted for about 40% of the cultivated land. In order to overcome the drought and ensure a great autumn harvest, after discovering the above situation, various places successively mobilized the masses to carry out drought resistance struggles. Up to now, millions of people throughout the province have been投入into drought resistance. Various waterwheels and other water lifting and carrying tools used for drought resistance throughout the province amount to about one million pieces.

    Because of studying and discussing the Party's general line of socialist construction, and using accounting and comparison methods in the struggle to make the masses realize the importance of drought resistance for guaranteeing a good harvest, coupled with the actions of cadres and the masses together in various places, the high enthusiasm and creativity of the masses have been stimulated. After studying the general line on June 5th, the Yuejin First Cooperative of Baiyu Township, Xinzhou County, had more than 370 members working to water and resist the drought all night, only stopping work when the cocks crowed for the second time. After studying the general line, Yuejin Eighth Cooperative immediately mobilized all the cooperative's waterwheels, manure buckets, and water buckets for drought resistance. As a result of the mobilization of the entire township, more than 6,000 mu of drought-affected cotton seedlings were all watered once or twice within seven days.

    A major feature of this year's drought resistance is that, in order to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, tools, and water, various places have organized communist cooperation, with very good results. According to the statistics of Huanggang Prefecture alone, more than 150,000 people participated in the cooperation. Macheng County in this prefecture put forward the slogan: "Those who have less should help those who have more (tasks), those who are fast should help those who are slow, support each other, and leap forward together." Qiting Township has seven cooperatives, of which four cooperatives have better water conservancy conditions and did not experience drought, but the other three cooperatives experienced more severe drought, with more than 300 mu of cotton seedlings about to die from drought. After organizing cooperation, the four cooperatives with water used water to support the three cooperatives lacking water, saving these more than 300 mu of cotton fields.

    So far, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, farmers in various parts of Hubei have made considerable achievements in the drought resistance struggle. In Jingzhou and Xiaogan Prefectures alone, more than one million mu of rice paddies and cotton fields have been rescued from near drought death. However, since it has not rained in various places to this day, many fields and lands that were not originally旱affected have also begun to show drought symptoms. The drought resistance struggle is entering a more arduous period. To this end, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities to continue to organize the masses to resist drought and expand the scale of the struggle, resolutely ensuring that: no seedling dies from drought, no rice shoot dies from drought, and a great autumn harvest is ensured.

    The Provincial Party Committee also notified all localities that in the drought resistance struggle, it is necessary to vigorously organize cooperation, and to use the energy of tool reform from the upsurge of water conservancy last winter and this spring to carry out tool reform on a large scale, in order to improve labor efficiency, so as to both resist drought and strengthen field management, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor when carrying out the above work simultaneously.

    (Our Dispatch) The massive emergency drought resistance movement has comprehensively accelerated the pace of water conservancy construction in Shandong Province. To date, the province has more than 80 million mu of land with water conservancy facilities. In the past ten days alone, the area of irrigated land in the province has expanded by more than two million mu, and more than 100,000 sets of simple water lifting tools have been created and promoted.

    In the mass drought resistance struggle, many difficulties that seemed difficult to overcome in normal times have been broken through by the masses one by one. In particular, the problem of water source shortage in some areas has been solved by the masses coming up with ideas and offering suggestions, tapping into abundant groundwater sources. In the four counties of Rongcheng, Huangxian, Wendeng, and Jimo in Laiyang Prefecture alone, more than 30,000 mountain springs were dug, 419 submerged rivers were intercepted at the bottom of the river, and more than 600 machine wells were drilled in just ten days. The people in mountainous areas have tried every means to search every mountain ridge and find all water sources for utilization. At the same time, some land that had not been leveled has also been leveled in the drought resistance struggle.

### 湖北人民决心不让旱死一蔸秧  山东在抗旱中加快了水利建设速度

    湖北人民决心不让旱死一蔸秧
    山东在抗旱中加快了水利建设速度
    本报讯　在社会主义建设总路线的推动和鼓舞下，已经获得夏季大丰收的湖北省的农民群众，正为确保秋季的更大丰收向旱象进行着顽强的斗争。到目前止全省投入这一斗争的已有几百万人，他们提出的响亮口号是：不让旱死一棵苗，不让旱死一蔸秧。
    5月底6月初，湖北省大部地区由于久晴不雨而先后发生了不同程度的旱象，部分地区受旱面积占耕地面积的40％左右。为了战胜旱象，确保秋季大丰收，各地发现上述情况后，即先后发动群众开展了抗旱斗争。全省到目前止先后投入抗旱的已有几百万人。各地动用来抗旱的各种水车和其他提水、担水工具等共达百万件左右。
    由于学习和讨论了党的社会主义建设总路线，在斗争中又用算账对比的方法使群众认识了抗旱对保证丰收的重要性，加以各地干部和群众一道行动，从而激发了群众的高度积极性和创造性。新洲县白渔乡跃进一社在6月5日学习了总路线后，有三百七十多个社员连夜车水抗旱，直到鸡叫二遍才收工。跃进八社学习总路线后，立即把全社的水车、粪桶、水桶都出动抗旱。由于全乡大动员的结果，六千多亩受旱的棉苗在七天内就全部灌了一次到两次水。
    今年抗旱中一个重大的特色是：各地为了解决劳力、工具、水量不足的困难，组织了共产主义的协作，效果很好。仅据黄冈专区的统计，参加协作的即达十五万多人。这个专区的麻城县提出的口号是：“少帮多（活路），快帮慢，互相支援，共同跃进”。企亭乡有七个社，其中四个社水利条件较好，未发生旱象，但另外三个社旱象较严重，有三百多亩棉苗眼看就要旱死了。组织协作后，四个有水社就用水支援三个缺水社，使这三百多亩棉田都得了救。
    到目前为止，湖北各地农民在各级党委的领导下，抗旱斗争已取得不小的成绩，仅荆州、孝感两专区即有百多万亩的稻田和棉地从将要旱死的情况中抢救了出来，但是，由于各地至今仍未下雨，不少原来未旱的田、地也开始呈现旱象，抗旱斗争正在进入更加艰巨的时期。为此，中共湖北省委要求各地继续组织群众抗旱，并扩大斗争的规模，坚决作到：不让旱死一棵苗，不让旱死一蔸秧，确保秋季大丰收。
    省委还通知各地，在抗旱斗争中要大力组织协作，并且要用去冬今春水利高潮中改革工具的干劲，大搞工具改革，来提高劳动效率，以便一面抗旱，一面加强田间管理，克服在同时进行上述工作时存在的劳力不足困难。　（方堤）
    本报讯　巨大规模的突击抗旱运动，全面地加快了山东省水利建设的速度。到目前为止，全省有水利设施的土地已达八千多万亩。仅最近十几天的时间，全省水浇地的面积就又扩大了二百万亩以上，同时并创制和推广简易提水工具十万多套。
    在群众性的抗旱斗争中，许多平素看来似乎难于克服的困难，都被群众逐一突破了。特别是部分地区的水源缺乏问题，通过广大群众人人出计、个个献策，把丰富的地下水源挖掘出来。莱阳专区的荣成、黄县、文登、即墨等四县，仅十天的时间就挖出山泉三万多个，掘深河底截住潜流四百一十九条，并打机井六百多眼。山区人民更是千方百计，踏遍每一处山岭，把一切水源都找出来，加以利用。与此同时，有些未加平整的土地，在抗旱斗争中，也得到了平整。
