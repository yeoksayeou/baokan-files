A New Atmosphere in a Machine Gun Company of a Certain Unit: Officers and Soldiers Unite and Help Each Other Like Brothers

(Our report) The excellent revolutionary tradition of respecting officers, cherishing soldiers, uniting, and helping each other has been fully developed in the machine gun company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after the rectification campaign.

The Platoon Leader's Quilt Covers the Soldier

One night during a cold snap, Wang Kejian, a new recruit this year, worried about being cold; however, he slept very comfortably all night. When he woke up in the morning, he realized that the platoon leader's quilt had been placed on him. He deeply felt the warmth of the revolutionary family as soon as he arrived in the army. Not long ago, Wang Kejian received a letter from home asking him to send some money back. He was worried because he had only enlisted recently and had saved a total of five yuan in the "Soldiers' Small Bank." When Squad Leader Wang Zhenhe learned about this, he agreed to withdraw the money for him and send it home. Soon after, Wang Kejian received another letter from home saying that since receiving the ten yuan sent, their life was not a big problem and hoped he would work with peace of mind. Wang Kejian was surprised and asked the squad leader with the letter, "I only saved five yuan, how come my family received ten yuan?" Before the squad leader could speak, the deputy squad leader said from the side: "The squad leader paid the remittance fee and added another five yuan for you." Wang Kejian was encouraged by this profound revolutionary friendship and determined to work hard to complete all the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. Many times, when it was his turn to be on guard at night, he automatically extended it by one or two hours to allow the squad leader and comrades to sleep more.

Since November of last year, after the machine gun company resolved some problems in the relationship between officers and soldiers through democratic examination, countless similar vivid examples of unity and friendship have occurred. When Squad Leader Li Zengyu's family was in difficulty, several company and platoon cadres raised more than twenty yuan to help solve the problem.

Company Cadres Take the Lead in Carrying Mess Kits

Not long ago, this company participated in several combat exercises. In each long march, thanks to good unity and mutual assistance, no one fell behind, and no accidents occurred. The company cadres were assigned to take care of a platoon each, and they helped anyone who was tired by carrying their guns for them. At the rear of the column, the company commander and political instructor saw that the cooks had a lot of things, so they took turns carrying the marching pots and the oil buckets. Sometimes, after forced marches, everyone's clothes were soaked in sweat. The company cadres, fearing that the soldiers would catch a cold, personally boiled spicy soup for everyone to drink.

"Our Company's Cadres Don't Act Like Officials"

In the past, after finishing a day of training, the cadres would return to their small rooms and rarely talk to the soldiers. Now, the cadres often talk to the soldiers and return to their dormitories only after the soldiers have gone to sleep. They also take turns checking the beds every night and covering the soldiers with their quilts. When a soldier is sick, the cadres personally take care of them and sometimes buy them some candies and snacks. They have achieved political concern and consideration for every soldier in their lives. The leaders can know what's on every soldier's mind in a timely manner. During the recent inspection of "five airs," the soldiers said, "We don't dare to talk about other airs, but our company's cadres definitely don't act like officials." Many big-character posters praising the change in the cadres' work style were posted.

The Soldiers' Discipline and Character Have Been Extraordinarily Strengthened

Now the company cadres deeply realize that once political and ideological education is strengthened and the relationship between officers and soldiers is improved, all problems can be solved easily. More obvious is the strengthening of the sense of collectivism and collective honor. In the past, some soldiers didn't care if their shooting scores were failing. Now, some comrades get a "good" score, but because they didn't get an "excellent" score, they are so upset that they can't eat.

    某部机枪连一片新气象
    官兵团结互助亲如兄弟
    本报讯  中国人民解放军某部机枪连，尊干爱兵团结互助的优良革命传统，经过整风后得到了充分的发扬。
    排长的被子盖在战士身上
    在一个寒潮袭击的夜晚，今年入伍的新战士王克俭，耽心着会挨冻；可是，一夜睡的挺舒服，早晨起来，才知道排长的花被子盖到自己身上了。他刚来到部队就深深感到了革命大家庭的温暖。不久前，王克俭接到家中来信，要他寄点钱回去。他心里犯了愁，自己入伍不久，一共积下五元钱存入了“士兵小银行”。班长王振合知道了这件事，就答应替他把钱取出来寄回家去。不多久，王克俭又接到家中一封信，说自从收到寄来的十元钱以后，生活没多大问题了，希望他安心工作。王克俭惊奇地拿着信去问班长：“我一共才存了五元钱，怎么家中收到十元钱呢？”还没等班长开口，副班长在旁边说：“班长出上汇费又给你添了五元。”王克俭为这种深厚的革命友爱所鼓舞，下决心努力完成上级分配的一切任务。有很多次轮着他夜晚站岗，他自动延长一二个小时，让班长和同志们多睡一会觉。
    自从去年11月间，机枪连通过民主检查，解决了官兵关系中的一些问题以后，类似这样团结友爱的生动事例是数不胜数的。六班长李增玉家中有困难，就是几位连排干部凑了二十几元钱帮助解决的。
    连干部带头背行军锅
    不久前，这个连参加了几次战斗演习，在每次长途行军中，由于团结互助好，没有一个掉队的，也没有发生任何事故。连的干部每人分工照顾一个排，看到谁走累了就替谁背枪。在队伍的后尾，连长和指导员看到炊事班的东西很多，就分工背着行军锅、挑着油挑子。有时经过急行军，大家衣服被汗湿透了，连的干部惟恐战士们感冒，就亲自烧辣汤给大家喝。
    “我们连的干部没有官气”
    过去在进行完一天的操课以后，干部就回到自己的小房间里，很少和战士谈谈话，现在干部经常和战士们谈心，晚上等战士们都睡了觉才回到自己的宿舍，还每晚轮流查铺，给战士们盖被子。战士病了，干部亲自照顾，有时还买些糖果点心给病号吃。对每一个战士都作到了政治上关心，生活上体贴。战士们有什么心事，领导上都能及时知道。在最近检查“五气”的时候，战士们说：“别的气不敢说，反正我们连的干部没有官气。”表扬干部作风转变的大字报贴出了许多。
    战士的纪律性格外加强了
    现在连的干部深深体会到：政治思想教育抓紧了，官兵关系改善了，什么问题都好解决。更明显的是集体观念和集体荣誉感加强了。过去有的战士射击成绩不及格，也不在乎。现在有个别同志取得“良好”成绩，因为没得到“优秀”，还难过的吃不下饭去。
