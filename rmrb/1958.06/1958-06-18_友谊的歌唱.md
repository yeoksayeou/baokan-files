    A Song of Friendship
    A Soldier of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    The scorching sun beats down at noon, sweat drips on the dam’s earth;
    Mouth parched and tongue dry, boiled water is like pearls.
    Korean "Amani," loves the Chinese People's Volunteers,
    Carrying a large earthenware jar on her head, she comes to deliver rice soup.
    After drinking, spirits rise, carrying earth as fast as the wind;
    The dam grows taller every day, certain to be completed soon.

    友谊的歌唱
    志愿军某部战士
    烈日正当午，汗滴坝上土；
    口渴舌又干，开水是珍珠。
    朝鲜阿妈妮，疼爱志愿军，
    头顶大瓦罐，来把米汤送。
    喝过精神爽，抬土快如风；
    水坝天天长，准能早竣工。
