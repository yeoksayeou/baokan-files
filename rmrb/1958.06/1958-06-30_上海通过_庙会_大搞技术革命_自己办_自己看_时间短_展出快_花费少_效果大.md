    (Reported by our newspaper) Shanghai is vigorously promoting technological revolution in all walks of life through the form of "temple fairs." "Temple fairs" are a popular ethnic form favored by the working people of our country. Now, Shanghai's various industries have widely adopted it as a form of exchanging technological revolution and work experience, and exchanging materials, making these tasks lively and effective.
    The Xuhui District was the first to use the "temple fair" form to promote work. They adopted this form to solve the cooperative relationship between factories and achieved unprecedented success, arousing people's interest. Later, the cotton textile industry applied this form to the industry-wide technical revolution review, competition, and experience exchange. The first day of the event was exceptionally lively, with over a thousand "deals" being "made" on the spot. Subsequently, industries such as printing and dyeing, chemicals, transportation, electromechanical, steel, and woolen textiles also held such "temple fairs." According to extremely incomplete statistics from some industries that have already held technical revolution "temple fairs," more than 1,500 grassroots units have "set up stalls" at the "temple fairs," with more than 26,400 innovation cases. The content includes: newly invented tools, improved tools, equipment, technology, operations, adoption of new technologies, new designs, new materials, improved working conditions, improved management systems, etc., truly "letting a hundred flowers bloom and providing a feast for the eyes." In the first few days of some industries holding "temple fairs," the number of people who came to "attend the fair" accounted for more than one-third of the industry's employees, which can be described as an unprecedented event.
    Upon entering the "temple fair," it is bustling and extraordinarily lively. On the stalls are displayed various technological creations, innovations, and improvements, large and small. The "stallholders" recommend the characteristics of these "goods" to the "fairgoers": what are the benefits, and how to make them. If the "customer" is interested, they fill out an order form, and the "business" is considered completed, with technology given away free of charge. If the problem cannot be solved at the time, they can also go to the factory for further observation and exchange. In addition to the "stalls" set up by each factory, there is also a "training ground" at the "temple fair," with on-the-spot teaching and learning. The "Wenzi knot" in the bobbin room of the Huayang No. 2 Cotton Mill is particularly well-tied. In order to "promote" this technology, the factory specially sent skilled workers to teach on the spot, and also gave away a knotting device after teaching.
    The "small teahouse" at the "temple fair" is full of distinguished guests, each holding a cup, discussing "business." Here, some factory directors are leading their entire team as receptionists, while others are technical innovators detailing their major innovations. The "innovation teahouse" of the cotton textile industry exchanged 124 innovation projects in the first two days and made 42 "deals" through counterpart connections. If customers have any "difficult problems," they can also go to the working group of the Scientific Popularization Association at the temple fair; or post a notice on the "recruitment list" to find friends and seek talents. There are indeed many brave and knowledgeable people at the temple fair who are willing to help. Sometimes, a notice on the recruitment list is posted and someone comes to take up the challenge shortly thereafter.
    At the "temple fair," there are also crosstalk performances, shadow plays, folk songs, and living newspaper plays. They sing songs of the Great Leap Forward and tell stories of innovators, showing both objects and people, with facts and ideas, which is very attractive.
    The "temple fair" is filled with communist ideology and the spirit of "selflessness." The Xinhua Printing and Dyeing Factory lacked "medium green." In the collaboration room of the "temple fair," they posted a big-character poster requesting fraternal factories to support 300 kilograms. The chief engineer of Printing Factory No. 1 saw it. Although Printing Factory No. 1 did not have it temporarily, they guaranteed that they would manufacture it themselves and supply it to Xinhua Printing and Dyeing Factory immediately. Similar vivid and touching examples are numerous in the "temple fair." A worker said after visiting the "temple fair": "The temple fair form is really good. Originally, I lacked work experience. After participating in the temple fair, I learned a lot. My mind was opened and inspired. The temple fair is really a good school for spreading technology."

    上海通过“庙会”大搞技术革命
    自己办　自己看　时间短　展出快　花费少　效果大
    本报讯　上海市各行各业通过“庙会”形式，大搞技术革命。“庙会”是我国劳动人民喜闻乐见的一种民族形式。现在上海市各行业已广泛地用来作为交流技术革命和工作经验、互通物资有无的一种形式，因而使得这些工作搞得有声有色，生动活泼。
    最早运用“庙会”形式推动工作的是徐汇区。他们采用这个形式，解决厂与厂的协作关系，获得了空前的成功，引起了人们的兴趣。以后，棉纺织业又把这个形式运用到行业性的技术革命的检阅、评比和经验交流上，举办的第一天，就热闹异常，当场“成交”了一千多笔“生意”。接着，印染、化学、交通运输，机电、钢铁、毛纺等行业也陆续举办了这样的“庙会”。根据已经举办技术革命“庙会”的部分行业的极不完全的统计，在“庙会”上“摆摊头”的基层单位有一千五百多个，各种革新事例二万六千四百多件。内容包括：创造发明的新工具，改进的工具、设备、工艺、操作，采用新技术，新设计、新材料，改善劳动条件，改进管理制度等等，真是“百花齐放、美不胜收”。有些行业在举办“庙会”的最初几天，前来“赶集”的群众便占到本行业职工的三分之一以上，称得上盛况空前。
    一进“庙会”，熙熙攘攘，分外热闹。摊头上，陈列着各种各样大大小小技术上的创造、革新和改进。“摊主”向“赶集”的群众推荐这些“货色”的特点：有什么好处，怎么做。如果“顾客”看中了，就填一张看中单，“生意”就算成交了，技术奉送，分文不取。如果当时不能解决问题，还可到厂里去继续观摩交流，除了各厂摆设的“摊头”以外，“庙会”上还有“讲武台”，当场包教包学。棉纺业华阳二厂筒子间的“纹子结”打得特别好，厂里为了“推销”这项技术，特别派了熟练工人当场包教，教会后还送给一只打结器。
    “庙会”上的“小茶馆”，则是高朋满座，一杯在手，谈论“生意经”。这里，有的是厂长带着全班人马充当招待员，有的是技术革新者在详细介绍自己的重大革新。棉纺业的“革新茶馆”在开始的最初两天，就交流了一百二十四项革新项目，用对口挂钩的方式做了四十二笔“生意”。如果顾客们有什么“疑难杂症”，还可以去找庙会上的科学普及协会的工作组；或者到“招贤榜”上贴一张告示访友求贤。庙会上确有许多这样见义勇为的有胆有识之士，有时一张求贤榜的告示贴出不久，就有人来揭榜了。
    “庙会”上还有说相声的、拉洋片的、唱小曲的、演活报剧的。他们唱的是跃进歌，说的是革新者的故事，见物见人，有事实，有思想，非常吸引人。
    “庙会”上到处洋溢着共产主义的思想内容，充满着“大公无私”的精神。新华印染厂缺乏“媒介绿”，在“庙会”的协作室里贴了一张大字报，要求兄弟厂支援三百公斤，一印厂的总工程师看到后，虽然一印厂暂时也没有，但是他们却保证自己制造后立即供应给新华印染厂。类似这样的生动感人的事例，在“庙会”里真是比比皆是。一个工人参观了“庙会”以后说：“庙会形式真正好，本来工作经验缺，参加庙会就知道，思想开窍启发大，庙会真是传播技术的好学校。”
