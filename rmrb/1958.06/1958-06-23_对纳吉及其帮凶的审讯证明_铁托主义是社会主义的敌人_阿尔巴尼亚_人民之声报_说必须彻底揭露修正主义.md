Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 21st: The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published a commentary on June 20th entitled "The Nagy Traitor Group and Modern Revisionism," stating: The Hungarian counter-revolutionary event was an organized conspiracy by imperialists to establish a hotbed of war against the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. There is no need to emphasize the tricks played by the imperialist bloc, as they are well-known and understandable.

The commentary said that we especially want to talk about the role played by the Yugoslav revisionists, who bear major responsibility in the preparation and execution of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary event. The Hungarian event and the trial of the Nagy group show that the Nagy clique were old friends of the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group. The speeches of Tito, Kardelj, etc., before and during the Hungarian event, the articles published by Yugoslav publications during this period, the inflammatory propaganda of the Yugoslav Communist revisionists about "democratization," "decentralization," and "workers' councils," and their exaggeration and slander of certain mistakes made by the Hungarian Party and the People's regime in the past – all of these became the program for the Nagy traitor group to achieve the goal of overthrowing the people's democratic regime. The documents drafted by Nagy and his accomplices based on these, such as "Morality and Ethics," "Some Urgent Issues," and "Five Basic Principles of International Relations," formed the ideological program for carrying out the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary.

The role of the Yugoslav revisionists became even more obvious during the counter-revolutionary event. The Yugoslav revisionists called the Hungarian counter-revolutionary event a "people's revolution." Vlahović, a member of the Executive Committee of the Yugoslav Communist League Central Committee, said in an article published in "Borba" during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary event that Yugoslavia and the "uprising" in Budapest represented a new socialist movement. When the Nagy conspiracy group came to power, Tito specially wrote a letter of congratulations. This congratulation was also an instruction encouraging Nagy to continue down the counter-revolutionary road.

The commentary then pointed out that the Yugoslav revisionists did not give up their sabotage activities and conspiracies even after the failure of the Hungarian counter-revolution. The Nagy group received the protection and support of the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest. The Yugoslav Embassy became a base for the remnants of the Hungarian counter-revolution to continue receiving instructions.

The commentary, in referring to the recent denials by the Yugoslav revisionists of their support for Nagy's counter-revolutionary activities, said that a sieve cannot cover the sun, and empty words cannot deceive the people. The commentary said that after Nagy's execution, the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group continued to defend the traitor Nagy, and on the 17th, "Borba" published Nagy's biography, calling him a "prominent figure" in Hungarian political life.

The commentary said that the people of socialist countries clearly recognize the true face of Titoism as a dangerous enemy of socialism. People will not only remain vigilant forever, but will also strengthen the struggle to thoroughly expose revisionism, especially Yugoslav revisionism, until it is completely destroyed politically and ideologically.

    对纳吉及其帮凶的审讯证明
    铁托主义是社会主义的敌人
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”说必须彻底揭露修正主义
    新华社地拉那21日电  阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”20日以“纳吉叛徒集团和现代修正主义”为题发表评论说：匈牙利反革命事件是帝国主义者为建立反对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的战争温床的一个有组织的阴谋。这里无须强调帝国主义集团所干的勾当，这是人所共知的和可以理解的。
    评论说，我们特别想谈一下在匈牙利反革命事件的准备和进行中，负有重大责任的南斯拉夫修正主义者所起的作用。匈牙利事件和对纳吉集团的审讯说明纳吉之流是南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团的老朋友。铁托、卡德尔等在匈牙利事件以前和在事件过程中的演说、南斯拉夫刊物在这一时期所发表的文章、南共修正主义者关于“民主化”“分散主义”“工人委员会”等煽动性的宣传，以及他们对匈牙利党和人民政权过去所犯的某些错误的夸大和污蔑——所有这一切都成了纳吉叛卖集团为达到推翻人民民主政权这一目的的纲领。纳吉及其帮凶根据这些所草拟的“道德和伦理”“一些迫切的问题”“国际关系的五项基本原则”等文件形成了在匈牙利进行反革命叛乱的思想纲领。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者的作用在反革命事件进行当中表现得更加明显。南斯拉夫修正主义者称匈牙利的反革命事件为“人民革命”。南共中央执行委员会委员弗拉霍维奇在匈牙利反革命事件的过程中，在“战斗报”上所发表的一篇文章中说，南斯拉夫和布达佩斯的“起义”代表着一个新的社会主义运动。当纳吉阴谋集团上台的时候，铁托特地写信表示祝贺。这一祝贺同时也是鼓励纳吉继续走反革命道路的指示。
    评论接着指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者即使在匈牙利反革命失败以后也没有放弃他们的破坏活动和阴谋。纳吉集团得到了南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆的庇护和支持。南斯拉夫大使馆成了匈牙利反革命残余继续获得指示的基地。
    评论在谈到最近南斯拉夫修正主义者为自己支持纳吉的反革命活动所作的抵赖时说，筛子是遮不住太阳的，空话是欺骗不了人民的。评论说，在纳吉被处决以后，南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团仍然在维护纳吉叛徒，在17日“战斗报”上公布了纳吉的生平，称他为匈牙利政治生活当中的“杰出人物”。
    评论说，社会主义国家的人民清楚地认识了铁托主义是社会主义危险的敌人的真面目，人们不仅将永远保持警惕，并且将加强彻底揭露修正主义，特别是南斯拉夫修正主义的斗争，直到它在政治上、思想上被完全摧毁为止。
