    This Practice Should Be Promoted
    Song Qian, Zhuzhou City, Hunan

    After watching the performance of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) Performing Arts Troupe, I can say that my eyes were feasted. At the same time, I had a different feeling compared to watching performances by other artistic groups: The ACFTU Performing Arts Troupe is truly starting to do what they said they would do - enriching the cultural and recreational life of workers and driving the cultural and recreational activities of workers.

    During the intermission, the stagehand didn't say the usual, "Comrades, we will now have a ten-minute break." Instead, she said: "Comrades, we just watched the performance on stage. Now, shall we all sing a song together?" The audience erupted in a clamor. I looked at the confident stagehand on stage with astonishment, truly sweating for her. But the audience shouted "Agreed!" When she asked again, the cheers shook the building. When teaching the song, each subsequent phrase was stronger than the previous one, each subsequent time was stronger than the previous one. At the end, the entire auditorium was boiling. I also transformed from being shy and embarrassed to being generous and brave in singing. The housewife in her thirties next to me finally let go and started singing as well.

    From this, I thought of the years of the past War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, when many patriotic youths and art warriors went to factories, streets, villages, and schools to promote the principles of revolution and resistance against Japan to the people there, perform for them, and sing inspiring and indignant songs with them. How many people were educated and enlightened by them and rushed to the battlefield.

    Today, in this era of the Great Leap Forward, isn't there also a need for this kind of propaganda and mobilization work? The ACFTU Performing Arts Troupe's approach is worth promoting.

    要提倡这种做法
    湖南株洲市　宋谦
    看了全国总工会文工团的演出，可说是饱享眼福，同时与看了其它文艺团体演出后有相异的一点感受：全总文工团真是开始按着他们说的那样来做了——丰富职工的文娱生活，带动起职工的文娱活动。
    当幕间休息时，司幕同志没按惯例讲一声：“同志们，现在休息十分钟。”而是说：“同志们，刚才我们看了台上的演出，现在让我们大家来演唱一个歌好吗？”台下哗然了，我用惊异的眼光望着台上信心十足的司幕同志，我倒真为她捏把汗。可是观众却喊出了“同意”，等她再问时，欢呼声震撼了屋宇，教唱时是后一句比先一句强，后一次比先一次强，终了时整个礼堂都沸腾了。我也由腼腆，不好意思转为大方，勇于歌唱了。我身旁的那位三十开外的家庭妇女，最后也放开嗓子唱起来。
    由此我连想到在过去的抗日战争、解放战争的年代里，有多少爱国青年和文艺战士，走到工厂、街头、农村、学校，为那里的人们宣传革命、抗日的道理，为他们演出，同他们一起唱着激动人心、愤慨昂扬的歌曲。有多少人受了他们的教育和启发，奔向战场。
    今天在这大跃进的时代里，不也正需要这种宣传鼓动工作吗？全总文工团的做法，是值得推广的。
