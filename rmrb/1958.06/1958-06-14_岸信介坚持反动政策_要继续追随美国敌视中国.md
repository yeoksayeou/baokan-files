Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 13th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's remarks at his first press conference after forming his new cabinet today show that the Kishi Nobusuke's new cabinet will continue to pursue domestic and foreign policies of following the United States, persisting in being hostile to the Chinese people, reviving militarism, and suppressing the domestic movement for peace and democracy.

In response to a reporter's question about Sino-Japanese relations, Kishi Nobusuke stated that his new cabinet does not intend to change its policy of hostility towards China. He said that changing his previous cabinet's policy of hostility towards China "is inappropriate." Regarding the incident in which Japanese thugs insulted the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki under his indulgence, Kishi Nobusuke still expressed his intention to take a "wait-and-see" attitude, attempting to continue to evade his responsibility for this serious incident.

In response to questions about Japan-U.S. relations, Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to continue to adopt a policy of subservience and dependence on the United States. Kishi Nobusuke revealed his intention to rely on the United States to implement economic expansion in Southeast Asia. He hopes that the United States will cooperate by providing dollars to help Southeast Asian countries purchase Japanese dumped goods on a deferred payment basis. He also stated that he would send a minister in charge to the United States to discuss these issues.

On domestic policy, Kishi Nobusuke reiterated that he would continue to try to revise the constitution that stipulates Japan's renunciation of war, so that Japan could freely rearm. At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke stated that he would implement the "small constituency system" to exclude Japanese democratic forces.

    岸信介坚持反动政策
    要继续追随美国敌视中国
    据新华社13日讯 东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在他成立新内阁以后举行的第一次记者招待会上发表的谈话表明，岸信介新内阁将继续执行追随美国、坚持与中国人民为敌、复活军国主义和镇压国内争取和平、民主运动的内外政策。
    岸信介在答复记者提出的有关中日关系的问题时，表示他的新内阁不打算改变敌视中国的政策。他说，改变他的上届内阁的敌视中国的政策“是不适当的”。谈到在他纵容下发生的日本暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗的事件，岸信介仍然表示要采取“静观”态度，企图继续逃避他在这一严重事件上应负的责任。
    岸信介在答复有关日美关系的问题时，表示要继续采取屈从和依赖美国的政策。岸信介表示出他企图依靠美国向东南亚实行经济扩张的打算。他希望美国在日本使东南亚国家采取延期付款方式购买日本倾销商品的问题上，通过提供美元给予合作。他表示还要派负责的大臣去美国商谈这些问题。
    在对内政策方面，岸信介再次表示他将继续设法修改规定日本放弃战争的宪法，而得以放手重新武装日本。同时，岸信介表示要实行排斥日本民主势力的“小选举区制”。
