　　Rice seedlings are green, wheat ears are yellow,
　　Busy with rice planting and wheat harvesting,
　　The sun sets in the west, still not home,
　　The golden rooster crows at dawn, leaving the village again.
　　The sickle is sharpened as bright as snow,
　　Only a flash of white light is seen when harvesting wheat,
　　Rice planting is so fast, the hands are hard to see,
　　In the blink of an eye, the white field changes into a green garment.

    栽秧割麦两头忙
　　秧苗青青麦穗黄，
　　栽秧割麦两头忙，
　　夕阳西下还未归，
　　金鸡报晓又出庄。
　　镰刀磨得雪样亮，
　　割麦只见闪白光，
　　栽秧快得难见手，
　　转眼白田换绿装。
