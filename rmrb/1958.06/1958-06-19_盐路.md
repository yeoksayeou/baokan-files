Salt Road
Political Department of the Tibet Military Region, Liu Ke

This is a new highway.

After crossing the Qilian Mountains, the car entered the Qaidam Basin. Surrounded by wilderness, I quickly dozed off in the driver's seat. I don't know how long we drove in my hazy state, but when I occasionally opened my eyes, I suddenly found that the straight and wide road had changed color, shining black and bright. I straightened up in surprise.

"What? Asphalt road?" It would be hard to imagine paving a road with asphalt here.

The driver smiled and shook his head. The car was speeding forward. After a moment of silence, he said faintly, "It's not asphalt. It's salt!"

"What? Paving a road with salt?" I widened my eyes and became indignant: "Who did such a stupid thing, paving a road with salt!" This is a terrible waste.

The driver didn't react to my indignation, casually spat out the window, and gently turned the steering wheel.

Dozens of kilometers passed, and the convoy stopped to rest. The derricks of oil wells faintly appeared on the horizon. At this time, some young men and women in the car jumped out happily, shouting excitedly by the roadside. Among them were technicians, doctors, and recent university graduates, all here to participate in the construction of Qaidam.

The driver raised his head, smiled, and said to me, "Smart man, you should get out and rest too. The road ahead is still long!"

Of course, I would get out of the car; I wanted to see clearly the fact of paving a road with salt, record it, and report it to the People's Daily. It's outrageous to use precious salt to pave a road! Don't they know how important salt is in the chemical industry? And in remote areas, ethnic minorities value salt more than gold!

However, before I could take out my notebook, the current scene shocked me: the road is salt; the land beneath the road is also salt; all around, under a thin layer of dust, it's all pure white salt! At a glance, it is a vast ocean of salt crystals! At this moment, someone whispered: "Motherland!" The voice was very subtle, but it was so loud and clear, stirring in the depths of people's hearts for a long time...

Qaidam has been sleeping for tens of millions of years, but our great Party has awakened it!

    这是一条新的公路线。
    翻过祁连山，汽车进入柴达木盆地。由于四周是一片荒原，在驾驶室里我很快就打起盹来。迷迷糊糊的也不知走了多久，当我偶尔睁开眼时，却突然发现平直而宽阔的公路已经变了颜色，黑亮黑亮地闪闪发光。我惊异地直起了腰。
    “怎么？柏油路吗？”公路在这里要铺上柏油，是令人难以理解的。
    驾驶员笑着摇摇头。汽车在急驰前进，停了片刻，他淡淡地说：“不是柏油。是盐！”
      “什么？用盐铺路？”我瞪大了眼睛，随着愤慨起来：“是谁干了这样的傻事，用盐铺路！”这真是天大的浪费。
    驾驶员对我的愤慨没有丝毫反映，漫不经心地向窗外吐了口唾沫，微微转动着方向盘。
    几十公里过去了，车队停下来休息。地平线上隐约出现了钻探油井的尖架。这时车上的一些青年男女欢快地跳下车来，在路边极端兴奋地又嚷又叫；他们之中有技术工人、医生、以及刚从大学毕业的学生，都是来柴达木参加建设的。
    驾驶员一扬头笑着对我说：“聪明人，你也下车来休息休息吧，前面路还远着哩！”
    当然，我是要下车的；我要把用盐铺路这件事实看清楚，记下来，向人民日报反映。太不像话了，用宝贵的盐铺路呢！他们不知道，盐在化学工业上有多么重大的作用；而在边远地区的少数民族，他们又是把盐看得比黄金还贵重！
    可是，我还没有摸出小本，目前的情景却把我震呆了：路上是盐；路下呢，也是盐；四周，在一层薄薄灰尘复盖下，也全是洁白的盐啊！一眼望去，是浩瀚的盐的结晶海洋！这时有谁轻轻地喊了一声：“祖国！”声音很微细，可是它却是那样地响亮，明朗，在人们心的深处久久激荡着……
    柴达木沉睡了千万年，但我们伟大的党，使它苏醒了！
