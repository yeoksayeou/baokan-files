(Reported from Guangzhou on June 22nd) The on-site meeting on trade work held by the Finance and Trade Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the financial and trade departments of the State Council in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, lasted for thirteen days. After visiting, introducing typical experiences, and group and plenary discussions, it concluded on the 18th.

On the 18th, Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Finance and Trade Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a summary speech on eleven issues. He first talked about the current situation of financial and trade work. He said: The current situation of financial and trade work is good. This year's summer harvest is very good. If no unexpected major disasters occur, the autumn harvest is also expected to be good. Although we cannot completely control natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, and winds, some can be basically controlled, and some are being controlled. State-owned industries and local industries are developing rapidly. Financial and trade work has also developed greatly during this period. Judging from the current situation, there will be new developments in economy, finance, culture and technology, business management, political thought, leadership style, etc. in the future. The tasks will become heavier and heavier, which requires us to do more work and do it better, and strive to achieve greater achievements in all aspects. In the past, financial and trade work has made great achievements in developing the economy, stabilizing market prices, transforming private businesses, and improving people's lives. The current work is based on the past work and achieved under the correct leadership of the Party. The errors and shortcomings that occurred in certain times and links in the past naturally had an unfavorable effect on production, but compared with the achievements, they were only some shortcomings in the victorious advance.

Comrade Ma Mingfang then discussed the following eleven issues:

One, Starting from Production, Support and Promote the Development of Agricultural Production Through Purchasing and Marketing Activities
This meeting had a lot of good discussions on this issue. Under the encouragement of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, agricultural production has greatly developed. This year, a new record of more than 4,300 jin per mu of wheat has appeared. This fact has broken the old and conservative views, greatly enhancing the masses' confidence in increasing production. The great leap forward in agricultural production has further increased the task of financial and trade work to support agricultural production. A significant feature of this year's agricultural production is the large quantity, variety, and urgency of the required means of production. The supply of new agricultural tools, transportation tools, fertilizers, soil fertilizers, medicines, and water conservancy equipment has increased several times, or even dozens of times, compared with last year. It will continue to increase year by year in the next few years. We should have a general idea in our minds, anticipate things in the first half of the year for the second half of the year, and anticipate things this year for next year, so that we can take the initiative in our work. The ways to solve the problem of supplying agricultural means of production are: first, rely on industry, but most of the raw materials needed by industry must be supplied through commerce. Therefore, commercial departments should do a good job in supplying raw materials and supply the products to production units in a timely manner. Second, rely on local methods, local methods plus some science and technology. Local methods are mass methods, large in quantity, wide in scope, and quick in effect. They can be adapted to local conditions and use local materials for local manufacturing. In addition to engaging in certain production themselves, commercial departments should use great efforts to organize and assist agricultural cooperatives to solve the problem of insufficient means of production by themselves by adopting local methods. Commercial departments should also actively try every means to supply livestock, seeds, and feed needed for agricultural production to supplement the shortage of agricultural cooperatives.

The commodity part produced by agricultural cooperatives should be purchased in full, and the price should be reasonable. Purchase at the place of production, inspect goods on the spot, and transport in a straight line. The main problem now is not that there are too many products, but that there are still too few products, and insufficient products. This will be the case for the next few years.

The primary task of commercial work to support agricultural production is to do a good job in supplying the means of production and purchasing agricultural products to promote the increase in grain and other crops. These are the two wings of supporting agricultural production. The better the supply and purchase work is done, the more conducive it is to the development of agricultural production. Without doing a good job in supplying the means of production and purchasing agricultural products, production cannot leap forward, or at least will be restricted.

Do a good job in supplying consumer goods, delivering goods to agricultural cooperatives, villages, households, and fields. Commercial work is not only directly related to industrial and agricultural production, but also directly related to the broad masses of urban and rural people. Commercial workers should not only be familiar with what production departments produce and what they need, but also be familiar with what consumers need, how much they need, what they do not need or do not need much, what they agree with and what they oppose, and combine production departments and consumers through our purchasing and marketing activities to promote the development of production and organize and guide people's lives. This is a complex and important economic, political, and mass work. To do these tasks well, we must have a high degree of political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, must have a global viewpoint, and must clarify that commercial workers are economic workers, but also political workers and mass workers.

Two, Organize and Assist Sideline Production
The scope of sideline occupations is very wide, including growing vegetables, growing medicinal materials, raising poultry and livestock, collecting wild plants and wild animals, forestry, minerals, etc. There are many types and treasures everywhere. We have a large population. If we arrange it well and launch a large-scale advance into nature in this regard, we can accumulate and create a lot of wealth.

In Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, the income from sideline occupations in 1956 was equivalent to the value of 100 million jin of rice. The output value of sideline production in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, is expected to reach 27 million yuan in 1958, accounting for more than 40% of the total agricultural output value, with an average increase in income of 51 yuan per person. In Lushan mountainous area of Henan Province, the income from sideline occupations accounts for 40% to 70% of the total income of farmers. This year, Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, can collect 70,000 dan of semi-finished fiber products, 30,000 dan of rayon, 6,000 dan of oil, 10,000 dan of starch, and 15,000 dan of sugar from collecting wild plants alone.

From this, it can be seen that the potential of agricultural and sideline production is very large. Developing it can increase wealth and improve people's lives; it can accumulate funds for the development of industrial and agricultural production, increase the raw materials needed for industrial and agricultural production; and it can increase export goods and earn foreign exchange.

The commodity nature of sideline production is very large, generally accounting for 70% to 80%. In addition to the part that commercial departments directly operate (such as nurseries, breeding farms, etc.), they should actively assist agricultural cooperatives in planning, arranging, and organizing production in this regard, and closely integrate agricultural production with sideline production. It is not right to affect the increase in grain production because of engaging in sideline occupations, but it is also not right to ignore sideline production. The purchase and sale of agricultural and sideline products should be organized in a planned manner, and purchase and sale should be closely combined with production.

Three, Commercial Departments Running Industries
Commercial departments should run some industries and play an active role in the development of industry. In the past, commercial departments also ran some industries and played a positive role.

Which industries should commercial departments run and in which directions should they develop to be better? This is a question that can be studied. I think there are roughly the following aspects:

(1) Processing industries for agricultural and sideline products, such as food processing, grain processing, wild plant processing, etc.
(2) Industries that provide demonstrations to townships and communities, such as agricultural tool repair and assembly, fertilizer manufacturing, and certain small-scale mining and processing industries.
(3) Certain small-scale industries that are urgently needed for agricultural and industrial production, but agricultural cooperatives and industrial departments do not have time to run, and commercial departments have the conditions and possibilities to run and can be completed in a short period of time.

It is a big task to run these industries well. The amount of each industry can be determined by local conditions and time. At the same time, we must pay attention to running the original processing factories of the commercial departments well and give full play to their potential. The output value of the original processing enterprises in the supply and marketing cooperative system alone is more than 2 billion yuan per year. There are also many in the grain and commercial departments, and they must all be run well.

In addition to running some industries on their own, commercial departments should pay special attention to organizing and assisting local and agricultural cooperatives in running industries well, exchanging experiences and technologies, and doing a good job in supplying raw materials and purchasing and selling products.

Finance and banking departments should play an active role in the development of industrial and agricultural production through their financial and loan activities, but they should generally not directly run factories.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, all localities should pay attention to organizing cooperation and mutual cooperation and mutual promotion, and avoid mutual competition and mutual restriction.

Four, Waste Product Utilization
China has a population of 600 million, and the market capacity is very large. Widely and rationally utilizing waste products and transforming various waste products into new products and into beneficial things through processing and manufacturing is an important task. When a new product begins to appear as a new product, it also begins to develop towards old and waste products. New products, old products, and waste products are always interrelated.

Waste product utilization is a large amount of wealth. In the past few years, Xinhui has recovered waste products, processed and utilized them, with a total value of 10.97 million yuan, an average of 50 yuan per household. The plan for this year is to reach 7 million yuan, equivalent to 100 million jin of rice, which is equal to half of the increase in grain production. The Xinhui Waste Product Utilization Exhibition displays many facts about waste product utilization, such as orange peel and mandarin orange peel can be used to make oil, lotus root tails, kudzu tails, and sweet potato residues can be used to make sugar and sauce, broken bricks can be used to make large bricks, and old wood can be used to make dung buckets and carts. Wuji County, Hebei Province, recovered 74 kinds of waste products in 1957, including 1.55 million jin of rags, broken shoes and socks, and old cotton, which were processed to produce 970,000 jin of cooked cotton, which can weave 320,000 bolts of local cloth. There are many such examples in various places. It seems like a small method and a poor method, but it is very useful if done well.

Xinhui's method of combining the recovery of waste products with beautifying homes is a good method. They have established home beautification service groups in various places, going door-to-door to help the masses clean up waste products and repair utensils. The masses sell waste products to pay for repairs without having to pay extra money, or paying very little money. From January to May this year, the county has helped more than 8,400 households repair furniture and beautify their homes, and recovered waste products worth more than 50,000 yuan. In Shang'an Street, Xinhui City, there is an old house. The back building is dilapidated and the residents cannot afford to repair it. After the home beautification service group studied and designed it, the doors, windows, beds, and benches were repaired, the rotten parts were replaced with new ones, and the leaks were repaired. It was completely new. It cost a total of 348 yuan, and the old wood, old bricks, and scrap iron cleared out after the house was repaired were valued at more than 420 yuan. After the house was repaired, there was still an income of 74 yuan. There is also an old house in the courtyard, where seven households live. In the past, the house was very dirty inside and outside. After the service group taught them techniques such as brushing walls, repairing furniture, and applying paint, and organized the families to help each other and cooperate, they cleaned up the entire courtyard in just two days. This method is very popular among the masses and is worth imitating throughout the country. This can also organize some people with skills but no fixed jobs and find them jobs.

Five, Establishing Township Finance
We should actively create conditions to gradually establish township finance. The township people's committee is the grass-roots government. The rapid development of agriculture, local industry, and cultural and educational undertakings urgently requires the township people's committee to establish its own finance. The township must have a certain fixed income to统筹 resolve the funds needed for the development of various undertakings. The relationship between the township people's committee and the people is more direct. Establishing township finance makes it possible to do a better job of finance within the scope of a township. According to the experience of Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, the greatest benefit of establishing township finance is that it can give play to the enthusiasm of the township government, and increase materials and financial income by organizing cooperation in all aspects, organizing mass production, and improving business management. It is estimated that the county's income will increase to 14 million yuan this year. If calculated according to 2,000 counties in the country, that is 28 billion yuan. Even if it is discounted, 10 billion yuan is calculated at 5 million yuan per county, and 8 billion yuan is calculated at 4 million yuan.

Here, let's talk about the issue of rural savings. Organizing savings to absorb idle funds to expand industrial and agricultural construction is a very important task and should be approached with a positive attitude, but it must be done through the voluntary participation of the masses and should not be too tense. Savings should be combined with the production and life plans of the masses to ensure that both idle funds are fully utilized to support production and the needs of the masses' lives are taken into account, and that it is convenient for the masses. This will win the support of the masses. Some places have adopted special deposit methods, such as New Year's savings, marriage savings, and house repair savings, which are very popular among the masses and are a good method.

Six, Technical Revolution Issues
We should widely carry out technical reforms. The characteristics of technical reform in the financial and trade system are small and scattered, with a wide range, and can be quickly and directly linked to the people's production. For example, improving rice selling machines can eliminate queues for the masses to buy grain. The scope of technical reform in the financial and trade system is very wide: there are technical reforms in processing enterprises, technical reforms in commodity transportation, sales, pricing, and packaging, technical reforms in storage and custody, technical reforms in service industries and catering industries, and technical reforms in manual operations. Technical reforms are growing and developing.

By the end of May, Xinhui County's grain, commercial, and banking departments had created and improved more than 280 kinds of tools. Among them are automatic rice selling machines, simple weighing devices (for raising pigs), cage weighing devices (for buying chickens and snakes), automatic oil selling machines, cloth measuring machines, etc. These creations and inventions have greatly improved work efficiency and reduced labor intensity. For example, in the past, six people in the grain sales department were too busy. The masses queued up to buy rice. Now, using an automatic rice measuring machine, only two people are needed, and the masses do not have to queue up. Using a lifting and lowering cloth measuring scale and a cloth rolling and marking machine, work efficiency is increased three times.

According to statistics from the Hubei grain system by the end of May, more than 950 kinds of tools have been improved and created, generally increasing work efficiency by three to five times, and some by more than ten times. The expenses of units using these tools have been reduced by more than 50% compared with the past, and the number of personnel has been reduced by 20% to 30%. Huangpi County's improvement of barley processing tools can save the masses 900,000 labor forces. The oil pressing tool created by the Baichi Oil Pressing Plant in Qichun County has increased efficiency by eleven times. If it is promoted throughout the province, it can free up more than 33,000 people.

The staff of the Zhangliang Grain Management Office in Lushan, Henan Province, created and improved 35 kinds of tools, including seven kinds of tools for purchasing, selling, and inventory, which increased work efficiency by three times, and the number of salespersons was reduced by half.

The above facts show that: Now it is not a question of whether there is technical innovation in the financial and trade system, but how to develop the technical innovation movement into a mass movement.

Technical revolution is a basic factor in developing productive forces. Technical reform in industrial and agricultural production is the basis of the technical revolution. However, promoting the technical innovation movement in the financial and trade system is also of great significance. It can improve work efficiency, reduce physical labor, and facilitate mass purchase and sale. The socialist ownership of the means of production, the liberation of productive forces, and the liberation of people's thinking have created broad prospects for the technical revolution. Technical reform can also promote the development of productive forces, make production more reasonably organized, and promote the development of science and culture, break superstitions and conservatism, and give play to the creative talents of the masses. From now on, comrades from the financial and trade departments in various provinces and localities should regard mobilizing the masses and carrying out the technical innovation movement as a major task, quickly and universally carry it out, and actively encourage, support, and help the masses to boldly create and boldly innovate, from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex. We should pay attention to combining mechanization, semi-mechanization, and manual operation techniques. At present, many labors still rely on manual work, and many people are not skilled in manual operation techniques, and need to be greatly helped to improve and improve.

Now I will introduce the situation of 118 people who have contributed to technical innovation in the grain, commercial, and banking departments of Xinhui County, which is enough to make people think deeply.

Among these 118 people, 100 people only have primary school education, and the remaining 18 people only have secondary school education. Fifty people were originally from farmers, and 41 people were from workers, accounting for 77%. Their current positions: 99 people are workers, shop assistants, and general staff, and 19 people are cadres above the section level. The ages of these people: 90 people are under 35 years old, and 28 people are over 35 years old.

Bourgeois scholars always describe inventions and creations as profound and unpredictable, saying that they are only the business of a few scholars, experts, and some noble people, and the working people have no share. If their statement is correct, then how can we explain the vivid facts that appear before us?

Eight, Establishing a System Where Employees Participate in Enterprise Management, Cadres Participate in Labor, and the Masses Participate in Supervision
Shops and factories affiliated to the financial and trade system should establish a system of employee representative conferences (or general employee meetings) to discuss and decide on major work issues in the enterprise.

Some shops have delegated purchasing, sales, and inventory to business groups, which is also a concrete content of employee participation in enterprise management. The implementation of this system is more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of employees. Delegating purchasing, sales, and inventory to business groups means that many things in the enterprise are handled by front-line employees, instead of piling many things on top; this can change the phenomenon that existed in the past where there was no goods to ask the upper level for, no knowledge of profit or loss, no decision-making power, and everything was asked of the leaders. Delegating purchasing, sales, and inventory to business groups can also reduce the number of full-time leaders and create conditions for cadres to participate in labor.

Enterprise units should minimize the number of full-time personnel, and managers and general cadres should directly participate in purchasing and sales work. Cadres should get along with the masses as laborers, go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner, changing the long-standing phenomenon that there are too many full-time management personnel and that management personnel are separated from direct business personnel.

Establishing a system for the masses to supervise enterprises, convening resident representative meetings and consumer representative meetings, and listening to the opinions and requirements of the masses to combine the work of enterprises with the masses has proven to be very effective. During the rectification movement, the broad masses put forward many useful opinions on commercial work and commercial workers, which greatly improved commercial work. The supervision of the masses should be formed into a regular system.

We should pay attention to strengthening political and ideological work among employees. We should pay attention to organizing employees' labor, rest, entertainment, and study so that everyone can work harmoniously and rhythmically. The employees are very active and enthusiastic, which is valuable. We should pay attention to protecting and consolidating this enthusiasm. The number of personnel should be streamlined, which is certain, but we should also pay attention to maintaining the necessary cadres and personnel.

By the way, let's talk about the issue of rules and regulations. Rules and regulations must be reformed. They should be simplified if they should be simplified, merged if they should be merged, abolished if they should be abolished, retained if they should be retained, and established if they should be established. The reform of rules and regulations should proceed from the principle of being conducive to production, conducive to business management, conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of employees, conducive to strengthening cooperation in all aspects, and facilitating the masses. In the past, some rules and regulations were designed to restrict capitalist industry and commerce. Now the situation has changed, and the system must also change. Some rules and regulations were not suitable in the past, and some rules and regulations are still applicable or basically applicable now. We are breaking and establishing, not negating the system.

Nine, Setting Up Banners
All industries, departments, and regions should pay attention to cultivating and establishing a number of advanced work units as banners. There should be a number of counties in the province, and a number of townships in the county as banners. Banners can inspire and encourage people, break the dull and conservative situation, and can also drive the backward and encourage the advanced. Banners are established after cadres and the masses have correctly carried out their work, not lightly imposed on a certain unit or region by anyone. After a banner appears, it should be seized, cultivated, and placed in a prominent position.

We must grasp the advanced, grasp the backward, and drive the middle, wave after wave, so as to constantly promote various tasks.

Ten, Cultivating a Contingent of Cadres Who Are Both Red and Expert
There are 8.5 million people in the national financial and trade system, including about 2 million cadres. We must vigorously cultivate a contingent of cadres who have communist consciousness, cultural and scientific knowledge, are proficient in their business, and can closely contact the masses.

All cadres should work hard to study Chairman Mao's works, and also study some works by Marx and Lenin, make plans, and start from the near to the far. Learn to apply them in actual work. From not understanding to understanding, from understanding less to understanding more. We must also learn culture, business, and technology. As long as we are determined and have the right method, we will definitely learn well.

Leading cadres should all plant experimental fields as a permanent system for combining physical labor and mental labor. Young intellectuals and cadres who lack grassroots work experience should be given opportunities to exercise in a planned and phased manner so that they can understand the production and life of the people and establish a class viewpoint and the feelings of the people. This is a major policy issue related to the cultivation of successors.

We should pay attention to discussing the "empty," use the "empty" to bring along the "real," and combine the "empty" and the "real." Some places have proposed that leading cadres of financial and trade departments at all levels should hold regular meetings to discuss the "empty," which is a good method. We should pay attention to organizing this work.

We should adopt various methods, such as running training classes, running cadre schools, holding competitions, and exhibitions, to improve the political and ideological and professional level of cadres.

The financial and trade departments in various localities should make a plan for cultivating cadres who are both red and expert (one year, three years, or five years) so as to carry out this work in a planned manner.

Eleven, The Party Committee's Unified Leadership
The financial and trade departments should regularly provide the Party committee with various situations, materials, and issues so that the Party committee can familiarize itself with and study the financial and trade work. The Party committee's financial and trade department should assist the Party committee in doing the following tasks: discussing and studying the work of the financial and trade departments; formulating short-term and long-term work plans; uniformly arranging the implementation of various major tasks; organizing cooperation in all aspects; and inspecting the implementation of the work. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the financial and trade department should pay more attention to political and ideological work and closely combine political and ideological work with economic work. Political work without economic work has no content and no power. The combination of political work and economic work will have endless effects on economic work. This has been fully proven by the experience of various places.

Twelve, Rectification
The rectification movement in grass-roots units of the national financial and trade system has mostly come to an end. Only a few regions and units that started later are carrying out a big debate or special rectification. There are still some backward units where the masses have not been mobilized, the leadership style has not changed significantly, major problems in the work have not been resolved, right-wing elements and bad elements have not been exposed, and the core backbone force has yet to be formed. Individual units are even occupied by right-wing elements or bad elements, and the enthusiasm of the masses is still being suppressed. According to the inspection of some areas in the previous period, backward units accounted for about 10%. The leading organs of various localities must conduct in-depth inspections to thoroughly carry out the rectification of these units.

In previous political movements, some units in the financial and trade system were often slipped through. This time, no unit should be allowed to slip through, and the appearance of backward units must be thoroughly changed. If you are afraid of trouble now, you will be more troubled in the future.

Units that have not yet struggled against and dealt with right-wing elements and four types of bad elements must overthrow and discredit them so that they are isolated and divided, and then dealt with. Attention should be paid to the fact that individual places have expanded the scope of struggle and used inappropriate methods of struggle.

Units where the movement has been carried out more deeply also have some incomplete aspects. For example, some units have not completely resolved the problems raised by the masses that can be resolved by the unit itself; some people whose mistakes are serious and need to be organizationally dealt with have not been completely dealt with. Units that have not been thoroughly reformed should make up for the lesson.

After entering the fourth stage, all units should study the rectification documents, study the general line, and check their thoughts and exchange their hearts with each other.

On the basis of the rectification movement, the Party's grass-roots organizations in enterprises should be reorganized. Where conditions permit, a separate branch should be established to form a strong leadership core and implement the system of division of labor under the leadership of the Party committee. If the organizational system changes, the Party's grass-roots organizations should also make corresponding adjustments.

The Party's grass-roots organizations are the foundation of the Party, and the foundation must be laid well and deeply. We should pay attention to discovering and cultivating a group of advanced branches as examples.

It is better to have one of the township Party committee secretaries in charge of financial and trade work, or to establish a financial and trade leading group, which is conducive to strengthening the Party's leadership over financial and trade work.

Ma Mingfang finally hoped that comrades from all localities would convey the spirit of this meeting, mobilize the vast number of employees, exert full effort, and advance courageously. Let us achieve more and greater achievements on the financial and trade front!

    财贸战线上的职工  鼓足干劲奋勇前进
    马明方部长在全国财贸工作新会现场会议上作总结发言
    本报广州22日电  中共中央财政贸易工作部和国务院财贸各部门在广东省新会县召开的贸易工作现场会议，经过参观、典型经验介绍和分组讨论、大会讨论，历时十三天，已在18日结束。
    中共中央财政贸易工作部部长马明方在18日的大会上，就十一个问题作了总结发言。他首先谈到当前财贸工作的形势。他说：财贸工作当前的形势是好的。今年夏田收成很好，如果不发生意外大灾害、秋田也丰收有望。虽然水旱虫风等自然灾害我们还不能完全管得住，但是有些基本上能够控制，有些正在设法控制。国营工业、地方工业正在迅速发展中。财贸工作这个时期也有很大的发展。从现在的形势看，今后在经济、金融、文化技术、经营管理、政治思想、领导作风等方面都会有新的发展，今后的任务是越来越重了，这就要求我们做更多的工作，把工作做得更好，争取在各方面取得更大的成就。财贸工作过去在发展经济，稳定市场物价，改造私商，改善人民生活等方面的成就是很大的。现在的工作是在过去工作的基础上取得的，是在党的正确领导下取得的；过去在某些时候、某些环节上发生的错误和缺点，自然起过不利于生产的作用，但是和成绩比起来，那只是胜利前进中的某些缺点。
    马明方同志接着论述下面的十一个问题：
    一、从生产出发，通过购销活动，支援和促进农业生产发展
    这次会议对这个问题讨论很多，很好。在全国农业发展纲要四十条的鼓舞下，农业生产有很大的发展。今年已出现小麦亩产四千三百多斤的新纪录。这个事实，打破了那些陈腐的保守观点，大大地增强了群众的增产信心。农业生产的大跃进，更进一步地加重了财贸工作支援农业生产的任务。今年农业生产的一个显著特点，是所需要的生产资料数量大，品种多，时间紧。今年新式农具、运输工具、化肥、土肥、药剂、兴修水利的设备等等的供应，都比去年增加几倍，有些甚至增加几十倍；明年、后年、以至今后若干年内，还要逐年增加。我们要心里大体上有个数，前半年预计到后半年的事，今年预计到明年的事，这样，工作就可以争取主动。解决农业生产资料供应问题的办法；一是靠工业，但是工业所需要的原材料，大部分又是要通过商业来供给的。因此，商业部门应当做好原材料的供应工作，并且把产品及时供应给生产单位。二是靠土办法，土办法加上些科学技术。土办法是群众性的办法，量大，面宽，收效快，可以因地制宜，就地取材，就地制造。商业部门除了自己搞某些生产以外，应该用很大的力量组织和协助农业社自己动手，采取土办法解决生产资料不足的问题。商业部门还要积极地想尽一切办法，供应农业生产上需要的耕畜、种籽、饲料等，以补助农业社的不足。
    农业社生产出来的商品部分，应当全部收下来，价格要合理。要到产地收购、就地验货、直线调运。现在的主要问题不是产品多，仍然是产品少、产品不足。今后若干年内也是如此。
    商业工作支援农业生产的首要任务，是做好生产资料的供应和农产品的收购工作，以促进粮食和其他农作物的增产，这是支援农业生产的两翼。供应和收购工作做得愈好，就愈有利于农业生产的发展，没有做好生产资料的供应工作和农产品的收购工作，生产就无法跃进，至少会受到限制。
    要做好消费品的供应工作，送货到农业社、到村、到户、到地里。商业工作不仅和工农业生产发生直接的关系，而且和广大城乡人民发生直接的关系。商业工作人员不仅要熟悉生产部门生产些什么，需要些什么，而且要熟悉消费者需要些什么，需要多少，不需要或者不大需要什么，赞成和反对的是什么，通过我们的购销活动把生产部门和消费者结合起来，促进生产的发展，并组织和指导人民的生活。这是一件复杂的重要的经济工作、政治工作和群众工作。要做好这些工作，就必须有高度的政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，必须有全局观点，必须明确商业工作人员是经济工作人员，同时又是政治工作人员和群众工作人员。
    二、组织和扶助副业生产
    副业的范围很广，种菜，种药材，饲养家禽家畜，采集野生植物和野生动物，林木，矿物等，种类很多，到处有宝。我们人又多，如果安排好了，在这一方面向自然界来个大进军，就可以积累和创造许多财富。
    广东新会县1956年的副业收入相当于一亿斤稻谷的价值。黑龙江双城县副业生产的产值预计1958年可以达到二千七百万元，占农业总产值的40％以上，平均每人可以增加收入五十一元。河南鲁山山区副业收入占农民总收入的40％到70％。四川奉节县今年采集野生植物一项，就可以制纤维半成品七万担，人造棉三万担，油六千担，淀粉一万担，糖一万五千担。
    由此看来，农副业生产的潜力是很大的。发展起来，可以增加财富，改善人民生活；可以积累发展工农业生产的资金，增加工农业生产上需要的原材料；可以增加出口物资，换来外汇。
    副业生产的商品性很大，一般占到70％到80％。商业部门除了自己直接经营的部分（如苗圃、养殖场等）以外，应该积极协助农业社规划、安排和组织这方面的生产，把农业生产和副业生产紧密地结合起来。如果因为搞副业而影响了粮食的增产，那是不对的，但是忽视了副业生产，也是不对的。应该有计划地组织农副产品的收购和销售，把购销和生产紧密地结合起来。
    三、商业部门办工业
    商业部门应该办些工业，对工业的发展应该起积极的作用。过去商业部门也办了一些工业，起了积极的作用。
    商业部门办那些工业，向那些方面发展才更好？这是可以研究的一个问题。我以为大体上有如下几个方面：
    （一）农副业产品的加工工业，如副食品加工、粮食加工、野生植物加工等等。
    （二）给乡社示范的工业，如农具修配、肥料制造、某些小型采矿、小型加工等工业。
    （三）农业和工业生产迫切需要，而农业社、工业部门来不及办，商业部门又有条件和可能办的某些小型的短期内可以办成的工业。
    把这些方面的工业办好，是个很大的任务。办多少，各地可因地因时制宜。同时必须注意把商业原有的加工厂办好，发挥它们的潜力。仅供销社系统原有加工企业的产值，每年就有二十几亿。粮食、商业部门也不少，都要办好。
    商业部门除了自办一些工业外，要特别注意组织和协助地方和农业社办好工业，交流经验、技术，做好原材料供应和产品购销工作。
    财政、银行部门应当通过自己的财务、贷款活动对工农业生产的发展起积极的作用，但一般不宜直接办工厂。
    各地应该在党委统一领导下，注意组织协作和互相配合，互相促进，不要互相争夺，互相限制。
     四、废品利用中国有六亿人口，市场容量很大。广泛地合理地利用废品，把各种废品经过加工制造之后，转化为新产品，转化为有利之物，这是一件重要的工作。新品当它以新品的姿态开始出现的时候，同时就开始向着旧品、废品方面发展，新品和旧品、废品永远是互相关联的。
    废品利用是一笔很大财富。新会几年来回收废品，经过加工利用，共值一千零九十七万元，平均每户五十元。今年计划达七百万元，相当一亿斤稻谷，等于粮食增产的一半。新会废品利用展览会，摆出许多废品利用的事实，如桔皮、橙皮、羌皮可以制油，藕尾、葛尾、薯渣可以制糖、制酱，烂砖制大砖，旧木制粪桶、车子等。河北无极县1957年收回各种废品七十四种，其中破布、破鞋袜、旧棉花三项共一百五十五万斤，加工后，出熟棉九十七万斤，可织土布三十二万匹。这样的例子各地很多，看起来是小办法，穷办法，但做好了用处很大。
    新会结合收回废品，美化家庭的办法，是一个很好的办法。他们在各地设立美化家庭服务组，逐户上门帮助群众清理废品，修理用具，群众卖了废品作修理费，不用另出钱，或者出很少的钱。今年1月至5月全县即帮助八千四百多户修理家具，美化家庭，并收回价值五万多元的废品。新会城尚安街有一间古老大屋，后楼残烂不堪，住户无力修理，经美化家庭服务组研究设计，将门窗床凳修好，挖烂补新，修葺漏破，焕然一新，总共出三百四十八元，而修理房屋后清理出来的旧木材、旧砖、废铁折价四百二十多元。房子修好了还收入七十四元。大院里也有一间古老大屋，住着七户人家，过去屋里屋外很脏，经过服务组向他们传授刷墙、修理家具、上油漆等技术，组织各家互助合作，共同整理，只两天的工夫，就把整个院子美化起来了。这个办法群众很欢迎，值得全国各地仿行。这样也可以把一些有手艺而无固定职业的人组织起来，找到工作。
    五、建立乡财政应当积极创造条件，把乡财政逐步建立起来。乡人民委员会是基层政权。农业、地方工业和文化教育事业的迅速发展，迫切要求乡人民委员会建立自己的财政。乡要有一定的固定收入，以统筹解决各项事业发展所需要的资金。乡人民委员会同人民群众的关系更直接些，建立起乡财政就有可能在一个乡的范围内把财政工作做得更好些。根据广东曲江县的经验，建立乡财政最大的好处是，可以发挥乡政权的积极性，经过组织各方面的协作，组织群众生产和改善经营管理，增加物资和财政收入，全县今年收入预计可增加到一千四百万元。如果按全国二千个县算，那就是二百八十亿，打上几折，一个县按五百万元算一百亿，按四百万算也是八十亿。
    在这里，谈谈农村储蓄问题。组织储蓄吸收游资来扩大工农业建设是很重要的工作，应当采取积极的态度，但必须通过群众的自愿，不要弄得过分紧张。储蓄要和群众的生产计划与生活计划结合起来，切实做到既能充分利用游资支援生产，又能照顾到群众生活所需，便利群众。这样就能取得群众的拥护。有些地方采取专用存款办法，如年节储蓄、嫁娶储蓄、修房子储蓄等，群众很欢迎，是个好办法。
    六、技术革命问题
    我们应该广泛地进行技术改革。财贸系统技术改革的特点是小而分散，面宽，可以迅速地直接地和人民的生产联系起来，如改良售米器就可以消灭群众买粮排队。财贸系统技术改革的范围很广：有加工企业的技术改革，有商品调运、销售、计价和包装方面的技术改革，有储存保管方面的技术改革，有服务业和饮食业的技术改革，有手工操作的技术改革。技术改革正在生长和发展中。
    新会县到5月底，粮食、商业、银行三个部门新创造和改良了的工具有二百八十多种。其中有自动卖米器、简易过磅器（养猪的）、笼阁过秤器（买鸡、买蛇的）、自动卖油器、量布机等。这些创造和发明，大大提高了工作效率，减轻了劳动强度。如粮食门市部，过去有六个人还忙不过来，群众排队买米，现在采用自动量米器，只用二个人，群众还不用排队。使用升降量布计算尺、卷布压码机，工作效率提高三倍。
    湖北粮食系统到5月底的统计，改良和创造的工具有九百五十多种，一般提高工作效率三到五倍，有的达十几倍。使用了这些工具的单位，费用较前减少50％以上，人员减少20％到30％。黄陂县改进大麦加工工具，可为群众节约九十万个劳动力。蕲春县白池榨油厂创造的榨油工具，效率提高十一倍，如果全省推广，可腾出三万三千多人来。
    河南鲁山张良粮食管理所职工创造和改良了三十五种工具，其中用于购销盘存方面的七种工具，工作效率提高三倍，营业员因此减少一半。
    上面这些事实说明：现在不是财贸系统有没有技术革新的问题，而是如何把技术革新运动发展成为群众性的运动。
    技术革命是发展生产力的一个基本因素。工业农业生产的技术改革，是技术革命的基础。但是财贸系统推行技术革新运动，同样有重大意义，可以提高工作效率，减轻体力劳动，便利群众购销。生产资料的社会主义所有制，生产力的解放，人们思想的解放，给技术革命创造了广阔的前途。而技术改革又可以促进生产力的发展，使生产组织得更合理，可以促进科学文化的发展，打破迷信和保守，发挥群众的创造才能。各省各地财贸部门的同志，从现在起，就应该把发动群众，开展技术革新运动看做一个重大任务，迅速地普遍地开展起来，积极鼓励支持和帮助群众大胆创造，大胆革新，从低级到高级，从简到繁。要注意使机械化、半机械化和手工操作技术相结合。目前许多劳动还靠手工，而手工操作技术很多人还并不熟练，需要大力帮助他们改进和提高。
    现在我把新会县粮食、商业、银行三个部门对技术革新有贡献的一百一十八人的情况介绍一下，是足以发人深思的。
    这一百一十八人中，有一百人只有小学文化程度，其余十八人也只是中学程度。原来是农民出身的五十人，工人出身的四十一人，两者占77％。他们现在的职务：当工人、店员、一般工作人员的九十九人，股级以上干部十九人。这些人的年龄：三十五岁以下的九十人，三十五岁以上的二十八人。
    资产阶级学者总是把发明和创造说得高深莫测，说它只是少数学者、专家和某些高贵的人的事，劳动人民是没有份的。如果他们的说法是对的话，那么在我们面前出现的这些生动的事实又怎样解释呢？
    七、建立职工参加企业管理，干部参加劳动，群众参加监督的制度
    商店和财贸系统所属的工厂，应该建立职工代表大会（或者是全体职工会议）制度，在职工代表大会上讨论和决定企业中的重大工作问
  题。
    有些商店把进货、销货、库存下放到营业小组，也是职工参加管理企业的具体内容。实行这种制度更有利于把职工的积极性调动起来。进、销、存下放到营业小组，就是企业中的许多事情由处在第一线的从业人员办理，而不是把许多事情堆在上边；就可以改变过去存在的那种没货向上要，赔赚不知道，当家不作主，事事问领导的现象。购、销、存下放到营业小组，还可以减少脱产的领导人员，创造干部参加劳动的条件。
    企业单位要尽量减少脱产人员，经理和一般干部都应当直接参加购销工作。干部要以劳动者身份和群众相处，深入实际，深入群众，及时发现和解决问题，改变过去长期存在的脱产管理人员过多，管理人员与直接营业人员相脱节的现象。
    建立人民群众监督企业的制度，召开居民代表会议，消费者代表会议，听取群众的意见和要求，把企业的工作和群众结合起来，已经证明效果很好。整风运动中，广大群众对商业工作和商业工作人员提了许多有益的意见，使商业工作得到很大改进，应当把群众的监督形成为一种经常的制度。
    要注意加强职工中的政治思想工作。要注意组织职工群众的劳动、休息、娱乐、学习，使大家都能够有节奏地和谐地进行工作。职工群众很积极、很热情，这是可贵的，要注意保护和巩固这种积极性。人员要精简，这是肯定的，但是也要注意保持必需的干部和人员。
    顺便提一下规章制度问题。规章制度要改革，该简的简，该并的并，该废的废，该留的留，该立的立。改革规章制度应该从有利于生产，有利于经营管理，有利于调动职工的积极性，有利于加强各方面的协作，便利群众出发。过去有些规章制度是为了限制资本主义工商业的，现在情况变了，制度也要改变。有些规章制度在过去就是不适合的，有些规章制度现在仍然适用或者基本上是适用的。我们是有破有立，不是否定制度。
    八、树立旗帜各行业、各部门、各地区都要注意培养和树立若干先进工作单位，作为旗帜。省内要有若干县，县内要有若干乡作为旗帜。旗帜可以振奋和鼓励人心，打破沉闷保守局面，也可以带动落后，鼓励先进。旗帜是经过干部和群众正确地进行了工作之后建立起来的，不是任何人轻加于某个单位和地区的。旗帜出现之后要抓住它培养它，把它放在显著的地位。
    要抓先进、抓落后，带动中间，一浪赶一浪，如此，不断地推动各项工作。
    九、培养又红又专的干部队伍
    全国财贸系统有八百五十万人，其中干部约二百万人。我们必须大力培养一支有共产主义觉悟、有文化科学知识、精通业务、能够密切联系群众的干部队伍。
    所有干部都应当努力学习毛主席的著作，也要学习一些马克思、列宁的著作，订出计划，由近及远。学会在实际工作中去运用。从不懂到懂，从懂得少到懂得多。也要学文化，学业务技术。只要有决心，方法对头，一定能学好。
    领导干部都要种试验田，作为体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的一个永久的制度。青年知识分子和缺乏基层工作经验的干部，要有计划地、分期分批地给他们以锻炼的机会，使他们懂得人民群众的生产和生活，树立起阶级观点和人民群众的情感。这是一个重大政策问题，关系到接班人的培养问题。
    要注意论虚，以虚带实，虚实并举。有些地方提出：各级财贸部门领导干部，定期开会论虚，是一个好办法。应注意组织这项工作。
    要采取各种办法，如办训练班、办干部学校、评比、展览等方法，提高干部的政治思想和业务水平。
    各地财贸部都要做出一个培养红专干部的规划（一年的三年的或五年的），以便有计划地进行这项工作。
    十、党委统一领导财贸部门要经常供给党委各种情况、材料和问题，以便党委熟悉和研究财贸工作。党委财贸部要协助党委做好如下的一些工作：讨论和研究财贸部门的工作；制定短期和长期的工作规划；统一安排各项重大工作的贯彻执行；组织各方面的协作；检查工作执行的情况。财贸部在党委领导下要更多地注意政治思想工作，把政治思想工作和经济工作紧密地结合起来。政治工作脱离了经济工作，就没有内容，没有力量。政治工作和经济工作结合起来，就会对经济工作起无穷无尽的作用。这一点已经被各地的经验充分证明了。
    十一、整风
    全国财贸系统基层单位的整风运动，大部分已经接近结束，只有一部分动手较晚的地区和单位正在进行大鸣大放或专题整改。还有一些落后单位，群众没有发动起来，领导作风没有显著转变，工作中的重大问题没有得到解决，右派分子和坏分子还没有揭发出来，核心骨干力量还有待形成。个别单位甚至还由右派分子或坏分子占领，群众的积极性还受着压制。据前一个时期部分地区的检查，落后单位约占10％左右。各地领导机关必须进行深入检查，把这些单位的整风搞深搞透。
    历次政治运动，财贸系统往往有些单位被滑过去，这次不要让一个单位滑过去，一定要彻底改变落后单位的面貌。现在怕麻烦，将来就会更麻烦。
    对右派分子和四类坏分子还没有进行斗争和处理的单位，必须把他们斗倒斗臭，使之陷于孤立、分化，然后加以处理。个别地方发生过斗争面扩大，斗争方法不适当的偏向，应当引起注意。
    运动搞得比较深入的单位，也还有一些不彻底的方面。例如，有些单位对于群众提出来的可由本单位解决的问题，还没有完全解决；对于一些错误性质严重，需要加以组织处理的人，还没有完全处理。改得不彻底的单位应当进行补课。
    在进入第四阶段之后，各单位则应当学习整风文件，学习总路线，结合检查思想，互相交心。
    应该在整风运动的基础上，对企业中党的基层组织进行一次整理。凡有条件建立支部的，都应该单独建立支部，形成坚强的领导核心，贯彻实行党委领导下的分工负责制。机构体制改变了，党的基层组织也应该作相应的调整。
    党的基层组织是党的根基，一定要把根扎好扎深。要注意发现和培养一批先进的支部作为榜样。
    乡党委书记中有一个人专管财贸工作，或者建立财贸领导小组，这个办法比较好，便于加强党对财贸工作的领导。
    马明方最后希望各地同志把这次会议的精神传达下去，动员广大职工，鼓足干劲，奋勇前进。让我们在财贸战线上取得更多更大的成就！
