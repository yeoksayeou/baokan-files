(Reported by our reporter Chang Rong) In order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign and maintain a vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit among the people, the Boyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has established a system for evaluating revolutionary drive and dedication. The establishment of this system has enabled frequent ideological exchanges between lower and upper levels, between the masses and cadres, and between departments, greatly enlivening democratic life and creating a strong political atmosphere everywhere.

The nationwide rectification movement has achieved tremendous success in Boyang County. The style of work of cadres has changed, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production has soared to unprecedented heights. In order to further unleash the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses during the Great Leap Forward, in addition to adopting methods of competition, inspection, and evaluation, and putting forward the slogan "Do something, debate something" to solve newly discovered problems, the County Party Committee has also explored and established a system for evaluating revolutionary drive and dedication in practice. This system can make up for the shortcomings of competition, inspection, evaluation, and debate, and can be regularized and involve everyone.

This system was first piloted in the County Party Committee's base point township - Sishilijie Township. After gaining experience, it was promoted throughout the county. Currently, not only rural areas, but also government offices, enterprises, and schools have established this system. The evaluation of revolutionary drive and dedication is generally carried out in close combination with competition, inspection, evaluation, and irregular debates, taking competition, inspection, and evaluation as a prerequisite, and debate as a means of solving ideological problems. After each competition, inspection, and evaluation, another evaluation of the drive and dedication of each cadre and member of the masses is conducted. In addition, it is stipulated that county-level office cadres should conduct evaluations every two months, mainly using Party and League activity days and administrative life meetings; district, township, and commune cadres should conduct evaluations every half month to one month, mainly using work brainstorming sessions; and commune members should conduct evaluations every three to seven days, mainly using production team work arrangement times. During the evaluation, generally the methods of self-reporting, public discussion, and open debate are adopted. The results of the evaluation are divided into three categories: those with the greatest revolutionary drive, those with general revolutionary drive, and those without revolutionary drive. Regardless of which category of drive one is evaluated as, everyone presents a large number of facts to illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, and the determination is made after obtaining the individual's consent. The evaluation is closely integrated with the central work of the time and place, and the content varies for cadres and the masses. For cadres, this includes whether the work in the areas they are responsible for is leading, whether they have paid attention to being both red and expert in their training, and whether the "five airs" have been eliminated, etc. For the masses, this includes how well they observe labor discipline, whether they cherish public property, and safeguard the interests of the state, etc.

The practice of three or four months has proven that the system of evaluating revolutionary drive and dedication is a good remedy for all ills, and it has shown its tremendous power among both cadres and the masses. For example, in Sishilijie Township, during the first evaluation of drive, 148 cadres were not active in their work and were rated as having third-class drive. However, in the fourth evaluation, there were only 23, and all were striving for first-class drive. In the past, this township had 459 people enjoying "Five Guarantees" (food, clothing, medical care, housing, and burial expenses). After the evaluation of drive, 274 of those who were able to work went to the fields. In the past few months, they have earned more than 30,000 work points and are expected to receive 4,500 yuan. The farmers in this township were accustomed to smoking dry tobacco. When working, many people used the excuse of smoking to rest. Now this has changed. In the past few months, the time saved in this area alone has resulted in more than 35,000 additional work points. Zhang Wenhua, secretary of the Party branch of Xiaoling Township, originally had a very serious conservative ideology. During the first evaluation of drive, everyone pointed out this shortcoming to him. Afterwards, he also summoned commune cadres to carefully investigate the conditions of the entire township and re-formulated the leap forward targets, planning for a per-mu yield of 800 jin, which was 300 jin more than the original. Cheng Jianfa, a member of Tuanlin Commune in Tuanlin Township, was not enthusiastic about production in the past. In early April, he only earned 46 work points and weeded only three-tenths of a mu of land each day. After being rated as having third-class drive for the first time, he was determined to learn from the advanced. In late April, he earned 87 work points and weeded six-tenths of a mu of land each day. Seeing his true transformation, the masses rated him as having first-class drive the second time.

In the evaluation of revolutionary drive and dedication, the members of the County Party Committee played a exemplary role. At the 39th plenary meeting of the County Party Committee held in mid-April, the method of "grasping both ends and leading the middle" was adopted, and the drive and dedication of each member of the County Party Committee were checked and identified separately. Among the 46 members of the County Party Committee, six were rated as having the greatest revolutionary drive, three were rated as having no revolutionary drive, and the rest were general. Comrade Mao Xinfa, secretary of the Sixi area District Party Committee, had great dedication and drive. He led the masses to establish a granular fertilizer factory and successfully trial-produced mixed round fertilizer and granular round fertilizer, which were promoted throughout the county. Therefore, he was rated as having "the greatest revolutionary drive." However, he mainly attributed the credit for the trial production of round fertilizer to himself, neglecting the strength of the masses and technicians, and his arrogance gradually increased. The members of the County Party Committee also pointed out this shortcoming to him and gave him strong criticism. Comrade Ling Binlai, secretary of the Huanggang District Party Committee, was passive in his work and lacked魄力 *pòlì* (forcefulness), which often caused the various tasks in the entire district to fall behind others, and was rated as having an "old woman" style. After returning, Comrade Ling Binlai unleashed his revolutionary drive and mobilized labor from all aspects to actively transplant rice seedlings. Not only did he not fall behind, but he also started several days earlier than some areas.

During this ideological debate among the members of the County Party Committee, it was discovered that many people did not subscribe to newspapers and were not good at constantly arming themselves with Marxist-Leninist thought. After discussion, a series of systems were formulated. For example, the secretary of the County Party Committee and the Minister of Propaganda must regularly read newspapers of the four levels of the Party, and the members of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee must write one to four articles each month, etc. These aspects will be listed as one of the main contents of the next evaluation of drive.

At present, all units have established evaluation organizations for revolutionary drive and dedication, and have prepared evaluation record books for revolutionary drive and dedication, which detail the evaluation situation each time for the year-end overall evaluation.

    谁的干劲足　谁的钻劲大　立见分晓
    波阳县建立评比革命干劲制度
    思想常交锋　政治作统帅　落后赶先进　先进更先进
    本报讯　记者长荣报道：为了巩固整风的成果，使人们经常保持着旺盛的革命斗志，中共江西波阳县委会建立了评比革命干劲和钻劲的制度。这一制度的建立，使得下级和上级之间，群众和干部之间，部门和部门之间，经常进行思想交锋，从而大大地活跃了民主生活，到处洋溢着浓厚的政治空气。
    全民整风运动，在波阳县取得了巨大的成绩。干部作风有了转变，党和群众的关系进一步密切，群众的生产劲头也空前高涨。为了进一步发挥干部和群众的这种积极性，在生产大跃进中，县委除了采取竞赛检查评比的办法，并提出“作什么，辩什么”的口号，解决新发现的一些问题外，还在实践中摸索出建立评比革命干劲和钻劲的制度。这种制度，可以弥补竞赛检查评比和辩论的不足，可以做到经常化和涉及到每一个人。
    这一制度，首先在县委的基点乡——四十里街乡试行，取得经验后，便在全县范围内推广。目前，不仅是农村、机关、企业和学校也都建立了这一制度。评比革命干劲和钻劲时，一般都和竞赛检查评比、不定期的辩论紧密结合进行，以竞赛检查评比为前提，以辩论为解决思想问题的手段，在每次竞赛检查评比之后，再对每个干部和群众进行一次干劲和钻劲的评比。另外，还规定县级机关干部每两月进行一次，主要利用党团活动日、行政生活会进行；区、乡、社干部半月到一月进行一次，主要是利用工作上的碰头会进行；社员三天到七天进行一次，主要是利用生产小组排工的时间进行。在评比时，一般都采取自报公议，大争大辩的方法。评比的结果，分为三类：革命干劲最大的，革命干劲一般的和没有革命干劲的。不管是被评为那一类干劲的，大家都摆出大量的事实，说明他的优点和缺点，并取得本人同意后确定。评比时，都和当时当地的中心工作紧密结合起来，其内容干部和群众各有不同。在干部方面，如所负责地区的各项工作是否领先，在锻炼上是否注意了又红又专，五气是否打掉等等。在群众方面，如遵守劳动纪律怎样，是否爱护公共财产和维护国家的利益等等。
    三、四个月的实践证明，评比革命干劲和钻劲的制度，是医治百病的良方，不论在干部和群众中，都显示出了它巨大的威力。比如四十里街乡，在第一次评比干劲时，有一百四十八个干部工作不积极，被评为三类干劲。但在第四次评比时，只有二十三个，而且都在努力争取一类干劲。这个乡过去有四百五十九人享受“五保”待遇，经过评比干劲后，其中二百七十四个有劳动力的都下了田。几个月来，他们已作了三万多个工分，预计可分到四千五百元。这个乡的农民习惯抽旱烟，在干活时，很多人借口抽烟去休息，现在已经有了改变。几个月来，光这方面节省出来的时间，就多作了三万五千个工分。肖领乡党总支书记张文华，原来保守思想很严重，在第一次评比干劲时，大家给他指出了这一缺点。以后，他又召集社干部仔细摸了一下全乡的底，重新制订了跃进指标，计划亩产八百斤，比原来的多了三百斤。团林乡团林社的社员程煎发，过去生产老是不起劲，4月上旬只做了四十六个工分，耘草每天只耘三分田。第一次被评为三类干劲后，便下决心要向先进看齐。4月下旬便做了八十七个工分，耘草每天也达到了六分田。群众看到他真正转变了，第二次就把他评为一类干劲。
    在评比革命干劲和钻劲中，县委委员起了示范的作用。在4月中旬召开的第三十九次全体县委会议上，采取了“抓两头，带中间”的办法，对每个县委的干劲和钻劲，都分别进行了检查和鉴别。在四十六个县委委员中，被评为革命干劲最大的有六人，被评为没有革命干劲的有三人，其余都是一般。泗溪领区区委书记毛新发同志，钻劲大，干劲足，带领群众建立了一个颗粒肥料厂，并试制混合圆肥和颗粒圆肥成功，在全县推广。因此，被评为“革命干劲最大的”。但他把试制圆肥的功劳主要归于个人，忽视了群众和技术员的力量，骄气逐渐抬头。县委委员们也给他指出了这一缺点，并进行了有力的批评。黄岗区区委书记凌宾来同志，工作被动，没有魄力，因而使全区各项工作常常落在别人之后，被评为有“老太婆”作风。回去后，凌宾来同志便发挥了革命干劲，调动各方面的劳动力积极插秧，不但没有落在后面，还比有些地区提早了好几天。
    在这次县委委员的思想大交锋中，发现不少人没有订阅报纸，不善于用马克思列宁主义的思想来经常武装自己。经过讨论，订出了一系列的制度。如县委书记和宣传部长要经常阅读四级党的报纸，县委常委每月要写出一篇到四篇文章等等。这些方面，都将列为下次评比干劲的主要内容之一。
    目前，各个单位都建立了革命干劲和钻劲的评比组织，并备有革命干劲和钻劲的评议记载簿，详细记载每次的评比情况，以备年终总评。
