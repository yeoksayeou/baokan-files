Localities Should Also Build Bearing Factories
Kong Sang

The successful trial production of oil-impregnated bearings by the North China Radio Equipment Factory is a piece of happy news. It not only opens up a path for saving large amounts of steel in the production of ball bearings, but more importantly, it opens up a broad field for our country to rapidly develop the bearing industry in a short period and meet the needs of all aspects during the Great Leap Forward.

Ball bearings are a widely used product in modern industry. Electric motors, machine tools, automobiles, tractors, bicycles, motorcycles, diesel engines, textile machinery, agricultural machinery, coal mining machinery, and so on, all require ball bearings. Our country is in a great historical period of the Great Leap Forward. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, and with the gradual realization of the technical revolution, the need for ball bearings will inevitably increase. However, the current production of ball bearings in our country is far from meeting the demand. According to the First Ministry of Machine Building, the country will need a total of 45 million sets this year, but can only supply about half of them itself; next year it will need more than 100 million sets; and by 1962, it will need about 300 to 400 million sets, of which about 100 million sets will be directly needed by rural areas. That is to say, next year's ball bearing production must be more than three times that of this year, and the 1962 production must be more than ten times that of this year in order to meet the demand. The ball bearing industry has become a weak link in the entire industrial chain.

If there is a weak link, it must be strengthened, this is our principle. We should accelerate the development of the ball bearing industry so that it catches up with the development needs of other industrial sectors. But how can we accelerate the development of the ball bearing industry? Is it completely relying on the central government to solve the problem, or are local authorities also solving it by themselves at the same time? "Many hands make light work." Relying solely on the central government's investment in building new factories is not enough. Only when all localities work together can there be high-speed development. Therefore, here, the combination of the central government's strength and the local strength, the combination of large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, is still the only correct policy, the only correct path. Moreover, the fact that the North China Radio Equipment Factory successfully trial-produced oil-impregnated bearings shows that the production of ball bearings is not mysterious, does not require very complex technology, and does not require a lot of investment to build a factory. Since each province, city, autonomous region, and special district can build other factories with more complex technology and more money, they can certainly build ball bearing factories. Therefore, we hope that every province, city, autonomous region, and even special district, will consider building one to several small and medium-sized bearing factories according to their own needs and possibilities, in order to supply the needs of industrial and agricultural development in their own regions.

    地方也要办轴承工厂
    孔桑
    华北无线电器材厂试制成功含油轴承，是一个令人高兴的好消息。它不只为在滚珠轴承生产中大量节约钢材开辟了道路，而且更重要的是为我国在短时期内迅速发展轴承工业，满足大跃进时期各方面的需要开辟了广阔的园地。
    滚珠轴承是现代工业里应用非常广泛的一种产品。电动机、机床、汽车、拖拉机、自行车、摩托车、柴油机、纺织机械、农业机械和采煤机械等等，都少不了滚珠轴承。我们的国家正处在伟大的大跃进的历史时期。随着工业农业的飞跃发展，随着技术革命任务的逐步实现，对滚珠轴承的需要必将越来越多。但是，目前我国滚珠轴承的生产远远不能满足需要。根据第一机械工业部计算，今年全国共需要四千五百万套，只能自给一半左右；明年需要一亿套以上；到1962年大约需要三亿到四亿套，其中农村直接需用的就有一亿套左右。也就是说，明年的滚珠轴承产量必须比今年多三倍以上，1962年的产量必须比今年多十多倍，才能满足需要。滚珠轴承工业已经成为整个工业链条中薄弱的一环了。
    有薄弱环节就得加强，这是我们的原则。我们应该加速发展滚珠轴承工业，使它赶上其它工业部门的发展需要。可是，怎样才能加速发展滚珠轴承工业呢？是完全依靠中央解决呢，还是地方也同时自己动手解决？“众人拾柴火焰高”，光靠中央投资建设新厂是不够的，只有各地一齐动手才有高速度的发展。所以，在这里，中央的力量和地方的力量相结合，大型企业和中小型企业相结合，仍然是唯一正确的方针，唯一正确的道路。况且华北无线电器材厂试制含油轴承的事实说明：滚珠轴承的生产并不神秘，并不需要很复杂的技术，也不需要很多的投资就能建设一个工厂。各省、市、自治区和专区，既然能建设其它技术比较复杂、花钱比较多的工厂，当然也能建设滚珠轴承工厂。因此，我们希望每一个省、市、自治区，以至专区，都考虑根据自己的需要和可能，建设一个到几个中小型的轴承工厂，以便供应本地区工业和农业发展的需要。
