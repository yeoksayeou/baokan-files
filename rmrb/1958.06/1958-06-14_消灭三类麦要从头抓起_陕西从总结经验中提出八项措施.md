Eliminating Third-Class Wheat Must Start from the Beginning
Shaanxi Proposes Eight Measures from Summarizing Experience

(Our Dispatch) Shaanxi Province recently held meetings to summarize the experience of this year's wheat bumper harvest and arrange next year's wheat production, proposing to eliminate third-class wheat fields next year.

Third-class wheat fields in Shaanxi Province account for about one-fifth of the total wheat field area in the province. Third-class wheat has few plants, small ears, and few grains. This phenomenon seriously affects the improvement of wheat yield per unit area in Shaanxi Province.

When discussing the elimination of third-class wheat, various regions summarized that the main reasons for the formation of third-class wheat are: first, poor tillage and moisture conservation. In many areas, most third-class wheat is stubble wheat. The stubble land is plowed shallowly, harrowed and ground fewer times, and cannot retain bottom moisture. Second, there is insufficient fertilization, especially insufficient base fertilizer. According to statistics from 21 counties including Chang'an, Huayin, Luochuan, and Huanglong, a total of more than 3.62 million mu of wheat fields were fertilized with base fertilizer last winter, accounting for about 47% of the total wheat field area in the above-mentioned areas, of which most of the wheat fields without base fertilizer are stubble wheat fields. Third, there is a small amount of sowing, late sowing, and rough sowing. Last year, third-class wheat was sown with 11 to 12 jin per mu, which was 5 to 10 jin less than ordinary wheat fields. The sowing time for third-class wheat fields in northern Shaanxi, Guanzhong, and southern Shaanxi was generally 10 to 15 days late. For example, the sowing work in the Guanzhong Plain ended before Frost's Descent (late October), but last year it was extended to the Beginning of Winter (early November); the climate in southern Shaanxi is relatively warm, and wheat sowing should be completed before the Beginning of Winter, but last year it was delayed until after the Minor Snow (late November). The agricultural proverb circulating in Shaanxi Province is "Grain must be hoed to be successful, wheat must be sown to be successful," but the sowing work in third-class wheat fields is just the opposite, sown very roughly, so that wheat cannot get a good development environment.

Based on these reasons, various regions proposed that solving third-class wheat should start from the beginning and be treated the same as other wheat fields in terms of operational technical requirements. The specific measures are: 1. Implement deep plowing in all wheat fields, carry out another autumn deep plowing movement on the basis of the summer deep plowing movement, and make full use of iron shovels for deep plowing, tractors for deep plowing, and double-wheeled double-share plows for combined tillage. 2. Apply base fertilizer to all fields, with an average of 10,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. 3. Use 666 powder for soil treatment to completely eliminate underground pests. 4. Sow all good varieties and treat seeds with pesticides. 5. Implement strip sowing and close planting in all fields, increasing the sowing amount to 25 to 30 jin per mu. 6. Irrigate all wheat fields with irrigation conditions, generally irrigating three times. 7. Topdress all wheat fields two to three times. Some counties (cities) proposed topdressing more than four times, with a fertilization amount of 5,000 to 8,000 jin per mu. 8. Carry out all mid-tillage, weeding, and rolling.

In order to ensure the realization of the above measures, various regions have put forward the slogan of "Early is best," and will carry out the preparatory work before wheat sowing in advance. For example, some counties have already planned to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign and promote new agricultural tools in advance, and generally adopt the working methods of collecting autumn crops, applying fertilizer, preparing land, sowing, and ridging simultaneously, so that the wheat sowing work can be completed about ten days in advance, basically eliminating third-class wheat fields and increasing wheat yield per unit area. If the yield of third-class wheat catches up with that of second-class wheat fields, the yield will increase by more than 100 jin per mu. The third-class wheat fields in the Guanzhong area alone can increase production by more than 300 million jin. If the third-class wheat catches up with the first-class wheat (a large part will definitely catch up with the first-class wheat), the yield will be even higher.

It is estimated that third-class wheat fields will still appear next year, but due to this series of measures, this wheat is already third-class wheat on a new foundation, and the number of such wheat fields will be much smaller than in the past.

### 消灭三类麦要从头抓起  陕西从总结经验中提出八项措施

    消灭三类麦要从头抓起
    陕西从总结经验中提出八项措施
    本报讯  陕西省各地最近在总结今年小麦丰产经验，安排明年小麦生产的会议上，提出了明年要消灭三类麦田。
    陕西省的三类麦田约占全省麦田总面积的五分之一左右，三类麦株数少，麦穗小，颗粒少。这种现象严重影响着陕西省小麦单位面积产量的提高。
    各地在讨论消灭三类麦的时候，归纳出形成三类麦的主要原因是：第一整地保墒差。好些地区三类麦多数是回茬麦，回茬地犁得浅，耙磨次数少，保不住底墒。第二是施肥少，特别是施基肥少。据长安、华阴、洛川、黄龙等二十一个县统计，去冬施基肥的麦田共三百六十二万多亩，约占上述地区麦田总面积47％，其中未施基肥的多数是回茬麦田。第三，播种量少，播种迟而且粗糙。去年三类麦每亩下种十一、二斤，比一般的麦田少五斤至十斤。陕北、关中和陕南等地的三类麦田的播种时间，一般迟了十天到十五天。例如关中平原播种工作在霜降前就结束了，而去年竟延长到立冬；陕南地区气候比较暖，小麦播种工作应在立冬前结束，而去年迟到小雪以后。陕西省流传的农谚是“谷要锄成，麦要种成”，但是，三类麦田的播种工作却恰恰相反，种的十分粗糙，使小麦得不到一个良好的发育的环境。
    根据这些原因，各地提出解决三类麦应该从头抓起，并且在作业技术要求上和其他麦田一视同仁。具体措施是：一、全部麦田实行深耕，在夏季深翻地运动的基础上再来一个秋季深翻地运动，并充分利用铁锨深翻、拖拉机深耕和双轮双铧犁套耕。二、全部实施基肥，平均每亩施基肥一万至一万五千斤。三、用六六六药粉进行土壤处理，彻底消灭地下虫害。四、全部播种良种，并用药剂拌种。五、全部实行条播密植，每亩下种量提高到二十五斤至三十斤。六、有灌溉条件的麦田全部进行灌溉，一般的灌溉三次。七、所有麦田追肥二至三次，有些县（市）提出追四次以上，每亩施肥量五千至八千斤。八、全部进行中耕、拔草和碾磨。
    为了保证实现上述各项措施，各地都提出了“一早百早”的口号，要提前进行小麦播种前的准备工作。例如有些县已经计划提前开展积肥运动和推广新式农具，并且普遍采用边收秋、边施肥、边整地、边播种和边打畦等工作法，使小麦播种工作提前十天左右完成，基本上消灭三类麦田，提高小麦单位面积产量。如果以三类麦赶上二类麦田的产量计算，每亩将增产一百多斤，仅关中地区的三类麦田就能增产三亿多斤。如果三类麦赶上一类麦（一定有很大一部分赶上一类麦），产量将更高。
    据估计明年还会出现三类麦田，但是，由于有了这一系列的措施，这种小麦已经是新基础上的三类麦，而且这种麦田的数字将比过去减少很多。
