Agricultural Production Enters the Era of the Great Leap Forward
Wu Zhipu Speaks on Henan Province's Bumper Wheat Harvest

(Reported by our newspaper) Henan Province, one of China's major wheat-producing regions, has achieved an unprecedented summer harvest this year. The total output of wheat and barley on 83,350,000 mu throughout the province reached 20.6 billion jin. Among them, the average yield per mu of 67,650,000 mu of wheat (harvested area) was 254 jin, with a total output of 17.1 billion jin, an increase of 1.29 times compared to last year and more than double the bumper year of 1956. Sixty-six counties and cities increased production by one to two times or more. Among them, nine counties and cities, including Meng County, Yanshi, and Bo'ai, 76 townships, and 1,778 communes achieved the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in one season of harvest. This growth rate is unprecedented in Henan Province. According to data from the Henan Provincial Bureau of Statistics, Henan Province's wheat production has increased by an average of just over 300 million jin per year in the eight years since liberation. During the faster-developing First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual increase was less than 400 million jin, while this year it increased by 9.6 billion jin. This year's summer grain (including wheat and barley) increased by 11.4 billion jin compared to last year.

Agricultural Production Enters the Era of the Great Leap Forward

Recently, this reporter interviewed Comrade Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the significance of Henan Province's bumper wheat harvest and how it was achieved. Wu Zhipu said: This year's bumper wheat harvest in Henan marks the entry of the province's agricultural production into a new era of the Great Leap Forward. It is also a good start for the Henan people to fundamentally change their face after three years of hard work. The bumper wheat harvest is a great victory for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction in Henan. It not only makes the people of the province see more clearly the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, but also further encourages the people of the province to exert even greater effort and better guarantee the victorious completion of the Second Five-Year Plan and the achievement of the "Four, Five, Eight" target ahead of schedule, creating more favorable conditions.

Next, Wu Zhipu refuted those "pessimists" who harbored doubts about the agricultural Great Leap Forward. He said: Last year, many "pessimists" cited "Henan is barren and the people are poor, and the cultivation is extensive" and "wheat is a low-yield crop" as "arguments," asserting that this year's increase could only be a few percent, and absolutely could not increase by tens of percent. But this year, the province is experiencing bumper harvests everywhere, regardless of mountainous areas, sandy areas, plains, or disaster areas. A yield of 1,000 jin per mu has become a common phenomenon. The highest record was created by the Satellite Agricultural Cooperative in Suiping County, reaching 3,530 jin per mu. The facts eloquently prove that wheat is not a low-yield crop; it has already stepped into the ranks of high-yield crops. As long as we conscientiously implement the General Line, production can leap forward no matter where we are. All the "tide-watching faction" and the "autumn reckoning faction" will never see their "tide" or calculate their "accounts" in Henan.

Great Ideological Emancipation

Talking about the reasons for the bumper wheat harvest, Wu Zhipu said: First and foremost, the entire Party and all the people conscientiously implemented the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and continuously and profoundly waged sharp struggles against right-leaning conservative thinking. The great victory of the rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the struggle against right-leaning opportunism within the Party since the second half of last year, as well as the in-depth development of the socialist education movement, Party consolidation, and commune consolidation in the countryside, laid a solid ideological foundation for this year's bumper wheat harvest. On this ideological basis, we emancipated our minds, further criticized conservative thinking and pessimistic views on agricultural production, and launched a great march towards agricultural production. Facts have proven that people with right-leaning thoughts are often cowards in production. When the province encountered a severe drought of 100 days without rain during the wheat sowing last autumn, those with conservative thinking did not exert themselves and invigorate their spirits to become masters of nature. Instead, they looked gloomy and depressed and acted as slaves of nature, advocating relying on heaven and waiting for rain to sow. At this critical juncture, the Party led the masses in launching a mass debate on whether to rely on heaven and wait for rain or to sow by fighting drought. Through the debate, superstitions were broken, and the idea of "man can conquer nature" was established, ensuring early and good sowing. Later, another debate was organized on whether wheat production could leap forward. Through the debate, the fallacies of "barren land, poor people, and mountainous, sandy, and disaster areas cannot increase production" were criticized, and advanced targets and measures were proposed. Subsequently, in every specific link of wheat production, such as winter watering, fertilization, eliminating third-class wheat, and strengthening late-stage wheat management, a major debate was launched between the two lines and two methods. On the one hand, all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas were thoroughly criticized; on the other hand, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was inspired, and the subjective initiative of the vast number of cadres and masses was fully utilized, ensuring the concrete implementation of various measures in wheat production.

Wu Zhipu said: This year's bumper wheat harvest in the province is inseparable from the hard work of the people of the province throughout the winter and the great efforts in the spring to carry out water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. This is another large-scale march by the people of the province to change the face of nature after the first upsurge of water conservancy construction in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. After this hard work, the irrigated area in the province has expanded to over 117 million mu, accounting for more than 86% of the total cultivated area, basically eliminating general waterlogging and drought disasters. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, not only have the old habits of neglecting fertilizer accumulation, such as "people have no toilets, pigs have no pens," been changed in many places, but also granular fertilizer plants have been universally established in communes and teams, mass-producing soil fertilizer and artificial urea, and developing indigenous chemical fertilizers. As a result, a "fertilizer network" relying on the masses for self-reliance has been initially formed throughout the province, accumulating a total of 3.3 trillion jin of fertilizer, averaging more than 25,000 jin per mu. These were things that could not even be imagined in the past. The development of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements has greatly enhanced people's belief in "getting grain from the land" and promoted the great emancipation of people's minds. In addition, in the water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements, we adopted the principle of combining capital construction with current production, loudly proposing "reservoirs are completed, canals are open, and water reaches the seedlings." Fertilizer accumulation should be accumulated, transported, and applied simultaneously, directly promoting wheat field management. This is an important condition for striving for a bumper wheat harvest.

Being the Masters of Nature

Wu Zhipu said: Persistently and unremittingly fighting against various natural disasters is also an important key to ensuring this year's bumper wheat harvest. This year, throughout the entire process from sowing to harvesting wheat, we were subjected to continuous disasters, some of which were rare in recent decades. For example, the severity of the drought at the time of sowing exceeded the great drought of "red land for thousands of miles" in 1942; there was unusually little rain and snow in winter, with some areas in northern Henan not experiencing a thorough rain for 200 days; in the spring, we continuously overcame several severe frosts; in May, the entire province was universally hit by a cold wave, the temperature suddenly dropped, and there were 7-8 grade winds, causing many wheat fields to collapse, and some areas even experienced the rare "May snow"; during the wheat filling stage, over 24 million mu of wheat fields were infested with wheat bugs. Over 10 million mu of wheat fields on both sides of the Huai River experienced continuous rain for more than a month before the wheat harvest. The people of the province launched tenacious struggles against the disasters with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. They put forward the heroic slogan of "being the masters of nature, not the slaves of nature," "meeting soldiers with generals, and water with earth," preventing before disasters arrive, and promptly inspecting and rescuing after disasters, thus basically ensuring that wheat seedlings were not affected by any disasters, powerfully guaranteeing the bumper harvest.

Comrade Wu Zhipu said: Secretaries took the lead, the whole people were mobilized, closely combined with the agricultural technology revolution, and conscientiously improved wheat cultivation management. Organizations at all levels from the province to the township had a secretary, deputy secretary, or member specifically in charge of leading wheat production. Special districts and counties established wheat field management committees, and communes established wheat field management professional teams to implement measures from sowing to harvesting. The main measures were as follows:

1.  Promote the "three fertilizers and five waterings" experience and universally carry out spring watering, winter irrigation, and increased topdressing. According to rough estimates, winter and spring watering of wheat totaled more than 100 million mu times, using 4 billion cubic meters of water, an increase of 3.5 billion cubic meters of water compared to last year. More than 20 million mu of "vegetarian fields" that had never been fertilized in the past were also universally fertilized this year. The amount of topdressing fertilizer in general wheat fields throughout the province increased from 2,000-3,000 jin per mu in the past to more than 20,000 jin, a tenfold increase compared to last year. Some high-yield fields even applied 50,000 jin, 80,000 jin, and 100,000 jin of fertilizer. Some high-yield fields in Yanshi and Meng Counties also developed this experience, reaching "six waterings and six fertilizings" or "seven waterings and seven fertilizings," making wheat grow stronger.
2.  Eliminate third-class wheat. In the spring, a slogan of "expand first-class wheat, improve second-class wheat, and eliminate third-class wheat" was proposed in a timely manner to strive for the average development of wheat. Party members, Youth League members, cadres, activists, or experienced old farmers were selected to manage it specifically, watering when there was a lack of water and fertilizing when there was a lack of fertilizer. As a result, all of the more than 14 million mu of third-class wheat in the province was transformed into first-class and second-class wheat due to careful management, sufficient fertilizer, and sufficient water.
3.  "Wheat is not harvested, management does not stop." Conscientiously strengthen late-stage wheat management to prevent lodging, changing the old habit of no one caring about wheat after Qingming in previous years.
4.  Promote improved varieties, close planting, and achieve early and good sowing. To ensure the implementation of these measures, various localities universally used the working method of the mass line, such as visiting, comparing, holding exhibitions, and holding meetings where there was advanced experience, using advanced experience to drive the backward, using facts to educate the masses. Cadres universally established experimental fields, went deep into the masses, studied technology, led production with production, discovered advanced experience, and summarized it, launching a movement to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. At the same time, they also continuously learned and applied the advanced wheat field management experience of fraternal provinces and cities such as Hubei, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Anhui, and put forward different battle slogans according to different periods, such as "wheat is not harvested, management does not stop," to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses. Due to the unprecedented rise in communist ideology, large-scale socialist cooperation was widely carried out in the wheat production process. During the drought-resistant wheat planting, 3 million people supported each other. During the wheat harvest, 5 million people left their counties, townships, and communes to support the wheat harvest in neighboring areas, thus ensuring that the wheat was planted well, grew well, and harvested well.

The Potential for Increased Production is Still Great

Comrade Wu Zhipu finally said: Henan's wheat production potential is still very great. It can leap forward this year, and it can also leap forward next year. Under the encouragement of the General Line, we must resolutely carry out the technical revolution in agricultural production and organize a continuous leap forward in wheat production. Last year, we did not do enough in terms of wheat base fertilizer, close planting, improved varieties, and deep plowing of the land. Therefore, this year's wheat production is very uneven, with a large gap between high yield and low yield, sometimes reaching dozens of times. These situations show that as long as we conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of continuous revolution, continue to exert great effort, strive for the upstream, conscientiously carry out the agricultural technology revolution, overcome past shortcomings, universally promote this year's high-yield experience, and continue to learn from the rich experience of fraternal provinces and cities, Henan's wheat production prospects are promising next year. Now, in addition to continuing to organize this year's autumn agricultural production Great Leap Forward, we have begun preparing for next year's even greater wheat harvest. Before the wheat harvest, various localities universally carried out wheat visits and comparisons, conducted field seed selection, summarized high-yield experience, and formulated next year's wheat production increase plans. The province will recently hold a wheat high-yield exhibition to promote advanced high-yield experience. We have initially determined that all wheat fields will be replaced with improved varieties next year; the land will be deeply plowed more than one foot before sowing; and the land will be leveled to ensure irrigation; 20,000 jin of base fertilizer and 30,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer will be applied per mu; narrow row close planting will be universally promoted; and the area of ​​large-area high-yield fields will be expanded. Measures will be taken before sowing to prevent the production of third-class wheat fields. As long as we are not arrogant or impetuous, are conscientious and diligent, and strive to implement the General Line for Socialist Construction, a continuous Great Leap Forward in wheat production next year is completely guaranteed.

    农业生产进入大跃进的年代
    吴芝圃就河南省小麦丰收发表谈话
    本报讯　我国主要小麦产区之一的河南省，今年获得了史无前例的夏季大丰收。全省八千三百三十五万亩小麦、大麦总产量达到二百零六亿斤，其中六千七百六十五万亩小麦（收获面积）平均亩产二百五十四斤，总产量达到一百七十一亿斤，比去年增产一点二九倍，比丰收的1956年增产一倍多。有六十六个县、市增加一倍到两倍以上。其中，孟县、偃师、博爱等九个县市、七十六个乡、一千七百七十八个社一季收获的粮食就实现了农业发展纲要（修正草案）中规定的粮食生产指标。这种增长速度是河南省过去从来没有的。根据河南省统计局资料，河南省的小麦在解放后八年来，平均每年只增加三亿斤多一点。在发展较快的第一个五年计划期间，平均每年也增长不到四亿斤，而今年就增加了九十六亿斤。今年夏粮（包括大、小麦）合计比去年增产一百一十四亿斤。
    农业生产进入大跃进的年代
    记者最近就河南省小麦大丰收的意义和如何取得这一丰收的有关问题，访问了中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃同志。吴芝圃说：今年河南小麦大丰收，标志着全省农业生产已经进入新的大跃进的年代，也是河南人民苦战三年、从根本上改变面貌的一个良好开端。小麦大丰收，是党的社会主义建设总路线在河南的伟大胜利，它不仅使全省人民更清楚地看到了党中央和毛主席领导的英明正确，而且进一步鼓舞全省人民鼓足更大的干劲，更好地为保证胜利完成第二个五年计划和大大提前实现“四、五、八”创造更为有利的条件。
    接着，吴芝圃批驳了那些对于农业大跃进抱怀疑态度的“悲观论”者。他说：在去年，不少的“悲观论”者，曾引用“河南地瘠民贫，耕作粗放”、“小麦是低产作物”等“论据”，断言今年只能增产百分之几，绝对不能增产百分之几十，但今年全省不分山区、沙区、平原和灾区到处丰收，小麦亩产千斤，已成为普遍现象，最高的遂平县卫星农业社创造的亩产纪录每亩达三千五百三十斤。事实雄辩地证明了：小麦不仅不是什么低产作物，它已经迈进高产作物的行列了，只要我们认真贯彻总路线，不论在什么地方，生产都能大跃进。所有的“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”，他们在河南永远也看不到他们的“潮”算不出他们的“账”了。
    思想大解放
    谈到小麦丰收的原因，吴芝圃说：首先是全党全民认真地贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线，不断地和右倾保守思想深刻地尖锐地斗争。去年下半年以来的整风运动，反右派斗争，党内反对右倾机会主义斗争的伟大胜利和农村的社会主义教育运动、整党、整社的深入发展，为今年的小麦大丰收打下了坚固的思想基础。在这个思想基础上，我们解放了思想，进一步批判了农业生产上的保守思想和悲观论调，展开了农业生产大进军，事实证明：具有右倾思想的人，往往就是生产上的懦夫。当去年秋天小麦播种时，全省遇到百日无雨的严重干旱，具有保守思想的人，不是鼓足干劲，振作精神作大自然的主人，而是哭丧着脸，精神萎靡当大自然的奴隶，主张靠天等雨播种。在这个紧要的关头，党领导群众开展了是靠天等雨呢，还是抗旱播种的群众性大辩论，通过辩论破除了迷信，树立了“人定胜天”的思想，做到了种早种好。以后又接着组织了小麦生产能不能跃进的大辩论，通过辩论批驳了所谓“地瘠民贫、山区、沙区和灾区不能增产”的谬论，提出了比先进的指标和措施。以后在小麦生产的每个具体环节上，如冬浇、施肥、消灭三类麦、加强小麦后期管理等，开展了两条路线和两种方法的大辩论，一方面体无完肤地批判了形形色色的右倾保守思想，一方面鼓舞了群众革命干劲，充分发挥了广大干部和群众的主观能动性，保证了在小麦生产中各项措施的具体贯彻。
    吴芝圃说：今年全省小麦大丰收，是和全省人民苦战一冬，大干一春大搞水利积肥运动分不开的。这是全省人民继1955年冬和1956年春第一次水利建设高潮后，又一次更大规模的为着改变自然面貌的大进军。经过这场苦战，全省水浇地已扩大到一亿一千七百多万亩，占总耕地面积的86％以上，基本上消除了一般水旱灾害。在积肥方面，不但改变了过去许多地方“人没厕所，猪没圈”不注意积肥的旧习惯，并且社社队队普遍建立颗粒肥料厂，大量地熏制土肥和人造尿及发展土制化学肥料，因而在全省范围内初步形成了一个依靠群众自力更生的“肥料网”共积肥三万三千亿斤，平均每亩可达二万五千斤以上。而这些在过去却是连想都不敢想的。水利积肥运动的开展，大大增强了人们“向土地要粮”的信念，促进了人们思想大解放。此外，又加上在水利和积肥运动中，我们采取了基本建设与当前生产相结合的方针，响亮地提出“库成渠通，水到苗长”。积肥要边积、边送、边施，直接推动了麦田管理，这是争取小麦丰收的重要条件。
    做自然的主人
    吴芝圃说：自始至终坚持不懈地和各种自然灾害作斗争，也是保证今年小麦丰收的一个重要关键。今年在小麦由种到收的整个过程中，曾经受到连续不断的灾害袭击，其中有的灾害是近几十年少有的。例如播种时的旱灾，严重程度超过1942年“赤地千里”的大旱灾；冬季雨雪奇少，其中豫北部分地区二百天没下透雨；春季又连续战胜几次严重的霜冻，全省在5月间又普遍遭受寒流袭击，温度突降并且出现七、八级大风，造成许多小麦倒伏危险，部分地区还下了过去罕见的“五月雪”；小麦灌浆时，二千四百万亩麦田上又发生了吸浆虫。淮河两岸的一千多万亩麦田在麦收前阴雨连绵达一个多月，全省人民以冲天的革命干劲，和灾害连续不断地展开了顽强斗争。他们提出：“要做自然的主人，不做自然的奴隶”“兵来将挡，水来土屯”的豪迈口号，旱时抗旱，霜来防霜，风来防风，有虫治虫，在灾害到来之前，便着手预防，灾后再及时检查抢救，因而基本上保证麦苗没有受到什么灾害，有力地保证了丰收。
    吴芝圃同志说：书记挂帅，全民动员，密切结合农业技术革命，认真改进小麦栽培管理。由省到乡各级组织都有一个书记、副书记或委员专门领导小麦生产，专区和县建立麦田管理委员会，社社建立麦田管理专业队，从种到收，贯彻到底。其中主要抓以下措施：
    一、推广“三肥五水”经验，普遍开展春浇、冬灌与增施追肥。根据大体估算，冬、春共浇小麦一亿多万亩次，用水量四十亿公方，比去年增加了三十五亿公方水，有两千多万亩过去根本不施肥的“斋公田”今年也都普遍施到了肥料，全省一般麦田追肥从过去每亩二、三千斤增加两万斤以上，比去年增加十倍。有的丰产田施肥还达到五万斤、八万斤、十万斤。偃师、孟县等一部分丰产田，并发展了这一经验，达到了“六水六肥”或“七水七肥”，小麦生长更加健壮。
    二、消灭三类麦。春季适时提出了“扩大一类麦，提高二类麦，消灭三类麦”的口号，争取小麦平均发展。挑选党员、团员、干部、积极分子或有经验的老农，专责管理，缺水浇水，缺肥施肥，因而使全省原有的一千四百多万亩三类麦，由于管理细致，肥大水足，全部变成了第一类、二类麦。
    三、“麦不收割、管理不停”认真加强小麦后期管理，防止倒伏，改变了往年小麦一过清明无人问的旧习惯。
    四、推广良种，密植，做到种早种好。为保证这些措施实现，各地普遍运用了参观、评比，开展览会，和那里先进就到那里开会的群众路线的工作方法，以先进带动落后，以事实教育群众，干部普遍建立了试验田，深入群众，钻研技术，以生产领导生产，发现先进总结经验，开展学先进，比先进，超先进运动。同时还不断学习与运用湖北、河北、山东、陕西、山西、安徽等兄弟省市的麦田管理先进经验，并根据不同时期提出不同的战斗口号，如“麦不收割，管理不停”以鼓舞群众干劲。由于共产主义思想空前高涨，在小麦生产过程中，广泛开展了社会主义大协作，在抗旱种麦中，有三百万人相互支援，麦收中，有五百万人离开了本县、本乡、本社，支援邻区收麦，因而保证了小麦种好，长好，收好。
    增产潜力还很大
    吴芝圃同志最后说：河南小麦生产潜力还大得很，今年能跃进，明年也能跃进，我们要在总路线的鼓舞下，坚决开展农业生产的技术革命，组织小麦丰产的连续跃进。去年我们在小麦的底肥、密植、良种、深耕土地等方面，还做的不够，因此今年小麦生产还很不平衡，高产与低产之间悬殊很大，有的竟达几十倍，这些情况说明，只要我们认真执行毛主席不断革命的指导思想，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，认真开展农业技术革命，克服过去的缺点，普遍推广今年高额丰产经验，继续学习兄弟省、市的丰富经验，明年河南小麦生产前途大有可为。现在我们除继续组织今年秋季农业生产大跃进外，已经着手为争取明年小麦更大丰收进行准备工作。各地在麦收前，普遍开展了小麦参观评比，进行了田间选种，总结丰产经验，并制定出明年的小麦增产计划，省里最近将举办小麦丰产展览会，推广先进丰产经验。我们初步确定明年所有麦田全部换用良种；播种前深翻土地一尺以上；并且要平整土地，保证灌溉；每亩施底肥二万斤，追肥三万斤；普遍推行窄行密植，扩大大面积丰产田，并且在播种前采取措施防止三类麦田的产生。只要不骄不懈，兢兢业业，努力贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，明年小麦连续大跃进是完全有把握的。
