Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: The European Trade Union and Labor Conference against the Threat of Atomic War and advocating for Disarmament and Peace, convened under the auspices of the World Federation of Trade Unions, opened in Berlin on the 20th.

Nearly three hundred representatives of trade unions and working people from more than twenty countries are participating in this conference. Representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions are participating in the conference as observers.

The conference adopted the following issues for inclusion in the meeting's agenda: The issue of striving to establish unified action by trade unions and working people of all countries against the threat of atomic war, the issue of striving for disarmament and peace, and the issue of striving for a better life and social progress.

Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech to the conference participants, emphasizing that the working people of European countries are increasingly aware of the dangers of arms expansion and war preparation, nuclear weapons testing, and the equipping of the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons. They are also aware that major powers must reach an agreement on the issue of reducing atomic armaments. The working people are increasingly clearly understanding that arms expansion and war preparation, nuclear weapons testing, and huge military expenditures make it impossible to improve living and working conditions in any way.

Louis Saillant welcomed the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation to be held in Stockholm.

In the discussions that followed, representatives from East and West Germany emphasized the danger of equipping the West German army with atomic weapons in their speeches. Representatives of the Permanent Committee of the All-German Workers' Conference described the people's movement protesting atomic armament being carried out in West Germany.

Volski, Secretary of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, emphasized the need to expand cooperation among European trade unions in the struggle against atomic armament. He suggested that the meeting draft a document on issues such as the unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in Europe, and the prohibition of equipping West German troops with atomic and rocket weapons.

Madame Gille, Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, spoke about the struggle of the French working class and trade unions to negotiate with Algeria and establish peace in Algeria, as well as to defend democratic rights and freedoms.

Shevchenko, Secretary of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, said at the meeting that the Soviet working people advocate resolving all disputes through negotiations.

He also emphasized the serious threat posed by the atomic armament of West German troops to the German people and the people of European countries.

The Council of the Federation of Free German Trade Unions distributed a statement expressing its willingness to conclude agreements with all trade union organizations in Europe on the issue of opposing the atomic armament of West Germany.
