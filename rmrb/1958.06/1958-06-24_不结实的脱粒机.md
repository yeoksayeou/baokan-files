    Flimsy Threshing Machine
    Recently, we purchased 1,300 units of manual threshing machines from the Hefei Farm Implement Factory in Anhui Province. After reselling them to various agricultural cooperatives, it was universally reported that the threshing machines were not sturdy. For example, the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Chengbei Township purchased two threshing machines, and in less than a day of use, one could not be used because the screws on the pedal came loose and the threshing teeth were bent, while the other could not be used because the axle broke. Similar situations occurred in every cooperative. We hope that this factory will quickly improve product quality.

    不结实的脱粒机
    最近我们从安徽省合肥市农具制造厂购进人力脱粒机一千三百台，经转售给各农业社使用后，普遍反映脱粒机不结实。如城北乡光明农业社买去的两台脱粒机使用不到一天，一台因踩板上的螺丝松脱和脱粒齿弯曲不能使用，另一台因为轮轴折断而不能使用。类似情况每社都有。希望这个厂迅速改进产品质量。中共湖北省安陆县委会  王长义
