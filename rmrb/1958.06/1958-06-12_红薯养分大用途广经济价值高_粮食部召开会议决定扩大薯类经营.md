Sweet Potatoes Have Great Nutrition, Wide Uses, and High Economic Value
Ministry of Food Calls Meeting to Expand Sweet Potato Management

(Our Newspaper News) The Ministry of Food convened a Southern Sweet Potato Meeting in Changsha City from May 20th to 28th. Huang Jingbo, Vice Minister of Food, who presided over the meeting, pointed out that this year the southern provinces will have a large increase in sweet potato (also known as sweet potato below) production, and how the food departments can do a good job in the management of sweet potatoes is of great significance to improving China's current food situation and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance to build socialism. Representatives from thirteen provinces and cities participating in the meeting conducted on-site visits and discussions around this issue, and exchanged experiences in terms of food use, storage, transportation, and processing.

At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that sweet potatoes are a high-yield crop with high economic value and wide uses, occupying a very important position in the lives of the people in the southern provinces, and are known as "one season of sweet potatoes for half a year's food." According to reports from representatives from various regions, the sweet potato planting area has generally expanded this year. According to estimates from ten provinces alone, the output will more than double that of last year. If converted into rice, it accounts for about 11% of the country's total grain output. For example, Chen County in southern Hunan Province plans to produce 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes per mu, and the highest-yielding areas will achieve 120,000 catties per mu. This is of great significance to improving China's current food situation and promoting the development of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and increasing farmers' income. The characteristics of sweet potatoes are that they contain a lot of water, are large in volume, have thin skins, are bulky, and are prone to rot and infection with diseases, making them difficult to store and transport over long distances. These difficulties can be completely overcome as long as they are taken seriously. However, in the past, due to insufficient research on these characteristics, coupled with the fact that many people in the food department had erroneous ideas such as being afraid of trouble and losing money, their enthusiasm for managing sweet potatoes was not high, and the quantity was very small. Some people believe that sweet potatoes are only a coarse grain for filling the stomach, with little nutrition, and urban residents in particular are not very accustomed to eating sweet potatoes. With the large increase in sweet potato production, how to eliminate these concerns and correct these erroneous views, and actively carry out sweet potato management work, has become a political task for current food work.

This meeting, in view of the above situation, adopted the methods of seeing, eating, talking, and doing, and specially held a "sweet potato banquet" and an exhibition of food processing machinery, and organized on-site visits and tastings. At the "sweet potato banquet," everyone drank 72-degree sweet potato wine and tasted 32 kinds of foods with both northern and southern flavors, all of which were delicious and palatable, including wontons, shumai, cut noodles, steamed buns, dumplings, and various high-end pastries. These foods were all made by mixing 35% to 80% of sweet potatoes. More than 100 kinds of edible processed samples were also displayed at the exhibition. After chemical verification, it was proved that sweet potatoes contain a lot of vitamins and various nutrients, and are cheap, beautiful, and taste good, with advantages that other grains do not have. Representatives concluded that sweet potatoes are not only a very good staple food, but also an important raw material for the food industry. The Chengguan Sweet Potato Processing Factory in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, can extract 40 catties of starch from 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes. The remaining 80 catties of residue can be used to make 4.8 catties of wine, and more than 90 catties of distiller's grains can be used as pig feed. After deducting the cost of raw materials, the various finished products made from 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes are worth 13.5 yuan. According to materials from the Datong City Distillery in Shanxi Province, every 100 catties of dried sweet potatoes can brew 53 catties of 65-degree white wine, which is 6 or 7 catties more than sorghum and corn. It can also be used to make vinegar, soy sauce, and as raw materials for fruit sugar, glucose, alcohol, and other products.

Through discussions, visits, and evaluation, everyone exchanged experiences in the storage, transportation, consumption, processing, and comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, and found many solutions to a series of technical problems to be solved in the future. Representatives from various regions were very interested in Hunan's experience in managing sweet potatoes. They have combined sweet potatoes with more than 100 kinds of biscuits and pastries in urban restaurants and food stores, which are cheap, beautiful, nutritious, and very popular among consumers. In terms of processing, dozens of processing machines selected from mass inventions and creations were displayed, two of which can be promoted, and the other several can be promoted after improvement. Their common characteristics are high work efficiency and labor saving, which are very suitable for agricultural cooperatives to use. Some have even developed into electric motor equipment, which can solve the difficulty of lacking labor for processing during the harvest season in concentrated production areas.

The meeting also exchanged views on some specific issues in terms of management policies, and believed that in the future, the work of sweet potato processing and storage should follow the mass line, mainly decentralization, and make various products according to needs and possibilities according to local conditions to meet the needs of urban and rural people. The meeting emphasized that actively carrying out sweet potato management is an important political task for the food department. In the past, because sweet potatoes were not managed as a staple food, the reputation and status of sweet potatoes has not been respected as it should be among a large number of people. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously carry out publicity and educate the masses to improve cooking techniques in the future to prepare for expanding sweet potato management this year.

Representatives from thirteen provinces and cities including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Shanghai participated in this meeting. (Luo Houren)

    红薯养分大用途广经济价值高
    粮食部召开会议决定扩大薯类经营
    本报讯　粮食部从5月20日至28日在长沙市召开了南方薯类会议。主持这个会议的粮食部黄静波副部长指出：今年南方各省红薯（即甘薯下同）将大量增产，粮食部门如何做好薯类的经营工作，对改善我国目前粮食状况和巩固工农联盟建设社会主义，都有重大的意义。参加会议的十三个省、市代表围绕这个问题进行现场参观和讨论，并就食用、储运、加工等方面交流了经验。
    会上大家一致认为红薯是一种经济价值高、用途广的高产作物，在南方各省人民生活中占着很重要的地位，素有“一季红薯半年粮”之称。据各地代表反映，今年红薯种植面积普遍扩大，仅据十个省估计产量将超过去年一倍多，如果折合稻谷计算，约占全国粮食总产量的11％左右。如在湖南南部的郴县专区就计划要亩产万斤薯，最高丰产地要实现亩产十二万斤。这对改善我国目前的粮食状况和促进工农业、畜牧业的发展，以及增加农民收入都有很大意义。红薯的特点是含水分多、体积大、皮薄、笨重，容易引起腐烂和感染病害，不易保管和长途调运。这些困难只要认真对待，是完全可以克服的。但是，过去由于对这些特点研究不够，加之粮食部门有不少人存在着怕麻烦、怕赔钱等错误思想，经营薯类的积极性不高，数量很小。有些人认为红薯只是一种粗糙果腹的杂粮，营养少，特别是城市居民对食用红薯还不大习惯。随着红薯大量增产后，如何消除这些顾虑和纠正这些错误的看法，积极开展薯类经营工作，就成为当前粮食工作的一项政治任务。
    这次会议，针对以上情况，采取看、吃、谈、做的办法，专门举办了“红薯宴”和食用加工机具等方面的展览会，组织现场参观尝食。在“红薯宴”会上大家饮了七十二度的红薯酒，饱尝了三十二种南北口味的食品，样样鲜美可口，有馄饨、烧麦、切面、包子、水饺和各种高级点心。这些食品都是掺杂了35％到80％的红薯做成。在展览会上也陈列出百多种食用加工样品。经化验证明：红薯中有大量维生素，含有各种营养成分，而且又价廉、物美、味道好，具有其他粮食所不及的优点。代表们由此得出结论，认为红薯不但是很好的主粮，还是食品工业的重要原料。湖南湘阴县城关薯类加工厂，用一百斤薯干可提四十斤淀粉，剩下的八十斤渣子，可制酒四点八斤，还可出九十多斤酒糟作猪饲料。除去原料费用，一百斤薯干制出来的各种成品，可值人民币十三元五角。另据山西省大同市酒厂材料，每一百斤薯干，可酿六十五度的白酒五十三斤，比高粱玉米要多六、七斤。它还可制醋作酱和作水果糖、葡萄糖、酒精等产品的原料。
    通过座谈、参观和评比鉴定，大家对红薯的储藏、运输、食用、加工和综合利用等方面交流了经验，对今后所要解决的一系列的技术问题找到了很多办法。各地代表对湖南经营红薯的经验很感兴趣，他们在城市酒菜馆和食品店已将红薯搭配制成一百多种饼干点心应市，物美价廉，又富有营养，很受消费者欢迎。加工方面，从群众发明创造中挑选展出的加工机具就有几十种，其中有两种可以推广，其他几种加以改进即可推广，它的共同特点是工效高、节省劳力，很适合农业社使用，有的并已发展到电动机具，可解决集中产区收获时期缺少劳力加工的困难。
    会议还就经营方针、政策方面的一些具体问题交换了意见，认为今后对红薯加工保管等工作应走群众路线，以分散进行为主，因地制宜地根据需要和可能制成各种产品，满足城乡人民的需要。会议强调指出：积极开展薯类经营工作，是粮食部门一项重要的政治任务。过去由于没有把薯类作为主粮经营，在很大一部分人们中，对红薯的名誉地位还没有得到应有的尊重，因此，今后必须大力展开宣传，教育群众改进烹调技术，为今年扩大红薯经营作好准备。
    参加这次会议的有广东、广西、湖南、湖北、四川、云南、贵州、浙江、福建、江西、山西、江苏和上海市等十三个省、市的代表。（罗厚仁）
