    Mountainous People are Poor But Have Higher Aspirations
    Guizhou Province to Establish Twenty-One Colleges and Universities

    (Our Dispatch) Guizhou Province is breaking through the mystified view that higher education is unattainable, and will establish twenty-one universities and specialized colleges this year. Among them, Guizhou Institute of Technology, and the three specialized colleges in the Zunyi area for agriculture, medicine, and teacher training are all well prepared. The remaining schools are also actively under construction, and will begin classes in the autumn of this year, and are currently preparing for summer enrollment.

    Among these twenty-one institutions of higher learning, the largest, Guizhou University, will offer majors in mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, history, and foreign languages. The Guizhou Institute of Technology, already established in Guiyang, specializes in training senior industrial talents urgently needed for the development of local industry in Guizhou Province. The other nineteen institutions of higher learning are divided by their professional nature into industry, agriculture, water conservancy, finance and economics, sports, medicine, and teacher training. Each prefecture, autonomous prefecture, and city in the province has a teacher training college to accelerate the training of teachers for the development of secondary education in various counties and districts. The Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture will also establish two specialized colleges for agriculture and teacher training this year.

    Before liberation, Guizhou Province was a poor and backward mountainous area. Apart from three institutions of higher learning in Guiyang City, the other seventy-nine counties and cities never had a university or specialized college. Especially in the remote ethnic minority areas, even primary schools were few and far between. In this year's great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas, with "higher aspirations despite poverty," urgently demanded to change the backward state of higher education. In order to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the technological revolution and cultural revolution, the higher education departments of Guizhou Province, under the leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, seriously criticized the "Guizhou is backward theory" and feelings of inferiority, broke through the mystified view that higher education is unattainable, strived for progress, and decided to greatly expand higher education this year.

### 山区人穷志更高  贵州省要办二十一所大专学校

    山区人穷志更高
    贵州省要办二十一所大专学校
    本报讯　贵州省打破高等教育事业高不可攀的神秘观点，今年内要建立二十一所大学和专科学校。其中贵州工学院、遵义地区的农科、医科、师范等三个专科学校，都早已筹备就绪，其余各校也正积极筹建，将在今年秋季开学上课，目前正进行暑期招生准备工作。
    在这二十一所高等学校中，规模最大的贵州大学，将设置数学、物理、化学、文学、历史、外国语等专业。已在贵阳建立的贵州工学院，专门培养贵州省发展地方工业中迫切需要的高级工业人才。另外的十九所高等学校，按其专业性质有工业、农业、水利、财经、体育、医药和师范等。全省每个专区、自治州、市都设有师范专科学校，加速培养各县区发展中学教育中的师资人员。黔南布依族苗族自治州今年也要设立农业、师范两个专科学校。
    贵州省解放前原是一个又穷又白的山区，除了在贵阳市有三所高等学校，其余七十九县市从来就没有过大学或专科学校。特别是边沿少数民族地区，连小学也寥寥可数。在今年工农业大跃进中，山区各族人民“人穷志更高”，迫切要求改变高等教育落后状况。为了适应工农业生产的发展和技术革命、文化革命的需要，贵州省高等教育部门在中共贵州省委领导下，严肃批判了“贵州落后论”和自卑感，打破了认为高等教育事业是高不可攀的神秘观点，力争上游，决定今年大办高等学校。
