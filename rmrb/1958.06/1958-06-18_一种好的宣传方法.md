    A Good Method of Propaganda
    I feel that it is very good that the People's Daily has published key excerpts of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in conjunction with news reports. Our classmates also say it is very good. This can help us solve the difficulty of lacking specific materials in our studies, and help us understand the meaning of a certain section, paragraph, or sentence of the report in a more specific and profound way.

    一种好的宣传方法
    人民日报配合新闻报道，把刘少奇同志代表中共中央向“八大”二次会议所作工作报告重点摘要发表，我感觉很好，我们同学也都说很好。这样可以帮助我们解决学习中缺少具体材料的困难，帮助我们比较具体深刻地领会报告的某节某段某句的意思。
