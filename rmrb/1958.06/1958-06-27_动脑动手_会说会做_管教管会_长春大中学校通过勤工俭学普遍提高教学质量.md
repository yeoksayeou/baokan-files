Using Brains and Hands, Speaking and Doing, Teaching and Managing
Changchun Universities and Schools Universally Improve Teaching Quality Through Work-Study Programs

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Li Detian reports: Over 58,000 students in universities and schools in Changchun City have actively participated in the work-study movement over the past three months and achieved very good results.

Since the launch of the work-study program in March of this year, according to incomplete statistics, universities, colleges, and technical secondary schools have established a total of 15 small factories for machinery manufacturing, assembly, and repair; middle schools have also established metal and woodworking factories, workshops, and shop floors. Schools throughout the city have also established 35 large and small farms, covering over 900 hectares of cultivated land. Many schools have also organized various service-oriented work-study groups to serve people within the schools. In addition, secondary and higher schools have signed contracts with more than 100 departments, including factories, basic construction, forestry, railways, and geology, to create good working conditions for students. Now, physical labor has become one of the important courses in various schools.

At the beginning of the work-study movement, some people once thought that "work-study programs would reduce the quality of teaching," and some were also worried that it would affect students' health. However, several months of practice have proved that schools, due to the implementation of the work-study policy, have combined teaching with production and theory with practice, thereby improving the quality of teaching. For example, in the past, the Chemistry Department of Northeast People's University only found topics for scientific research and graduation theses from books, which were not practical. After the implementation of the work-study program this year, most of the students' graduation theses were based on problems that urgently needed to be solved by industrial and business departments. Among the 114 production projects in which the department cooperated with various parties, 83 were listed as graduation thesis topics. In the past, the 16 secondary vocational schools in Changchun City generally had a tendency to be divorced from reality. Teachers and students were accustomed to using their brains but not their hands, and the knowledge they learned was difficult to consolidate and was not useful. Some teachers at the Architectural Engineering School said that in the past they "could only talk about houses, but couldn't build houses." Now, through construction practice, teachers and students at the school have improved their operational skills and consolidated their theoretical knowledge in less than a month. Students at the Agricultural Mechanization School said that they used to get perfect scores in both automobile tractor and repair courses every time, but when they went to the factory, they didn't understand anything, and they were very anxious. Now they attend classes in the morning and work in the afternoon. When they encounter problems in the production process, they no longer memorize book theory, but can use their own language to explain the tractor from entering the factory, disassembling, repairing, installing, experimenting, and leaving the factory. Due to the combination of majors and production labor, teachers began to overcome the shortcomings of "moving their mouths but not their hands, being able to speak but not being able to do, managing teaching but not managing learning" in the past. Now, many teachers are teachers in class and workshop directors, foremen, or captains in production.

The work-study movement in various schools has combined intellectuals with workers and peasants, and mental labor with physical labor, thus profoundly changing the students' mental outlook. A song praising labor is circulating among the students of Northeast Normal University Affiliated Middle School: "Eat more, sleep soundly, have a good mood, have good spirits; insomnia and headaches are swept away, and memory is also enhanced." In the past, most of the students at the Health School were unwilling to be nurses, thinking it was "humble." After the launch of the work-study movement, they had a correct understanding of the relationship between mental and physical labor, so more than 90% of the students expressed their willingness to be nurses for life.

The work-study movement over the past few months has greatly enhanced the students' physical fitness. According to surveys in many schools, it has been proven that after students participate in work-study activities, their weight, vital capacity, and grip strength have all increased.

The development of work-study programs has been widely praised by public opinion. In the past two months or so, the city has received 1,456 letters of praise from various parties, expressing their sincere support for work-study programs.

    动脑动手　会说会做　管教管会
    长春大中学校通过勤工俭学普遍提高教学质量
    本报讯　记者李德天报道：长春市各大、中学校五万八千多学生，三个月来，积极参加了勤工俭学运动，获得了很好的效果。
    自今年3月份开展勤工俭学以来，据不完全的统计，各大专和中等技术学校已拥有机械制造、装配、修配等小型工厂共十五个；中学也成立了金木工厂、手工作坊、车间等。全市学校还建立了大、小农场三十五个，九百多公顷耕地。许多学校还组织了各种服务性的勤工俭学小组，为校内人员服务。除此以外，中等以上学校又和工厂、基本建设、森林、铁路、地质等一百多个部门订立了合同，为学生创造了良好的劳动条件。现在，体力劳动已成为各学校的重要课程之一。
    在勤工俭学运动开展之初，有些人曾经认为“勤工俭学会降低教学质量”，也有人担心会影响学生的健康。但是几个月的实践证明：各学校由于贯彻了勤工俭学方针，使教学和生产相结合，理论和实际相结合，从而提高了教学质量。比如东北人民大学化学系过去作科学研究和毕业论文，只是从书本上找题目，不切实际。今年开展勤工俭学后，学生的毕业论文绝大部分都是根据工业、企业部门急需解决的问题确定题目。这个系和各方面进行协作的一百一十四个生产项目中，有八十三项被列为毕业论文题目。长春市的十六所中等专业学校过去普遍存在着脱离实际的倾向，教师、学生习惯于只动脑不动手，所学的知识难以巩固，还不管用。建筑工程学校有些教师说，他们过去“只会说房子，不会盖房子”。现在，这个学校的师生们通过施工实践，不到一个月的时间，都提高了操作技能，巩固了理论知识。农业机械化学校学生说，他们过去对汽车拖拉机和修理两门课程每次都考五分，可是到工厂以后啥也不懂，心中急得发慌。现在他们上午上课，下午劳动，碰到工艺过程中的问题，不再是空背书本理论，而是用自己的语言能把拖拉机从进厂、拆卸、修理、安装、实验、出厂一一加以说明。由于专业结合生产劳动进行，使教师们开始克服过去教学中“动嘴不动手，会说不会作，管教不管会”的缺点。现在很多教师在上课时当老师，生产时当车间主任、工长或队长。
    各校的勤工俭学运动，使知识分子和工农相结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，因而使学生们的精神面貌发生着深刻的变化。东北师范大学附中学生中流传着这样一首赞颂劳动的歌谣：“吃得多，睡得香，情绪好，精神爽；失眠、头痛一扫光，记忆力也增强”。卫生学校学生过去大部分都不愿当护士，认为“卑贱”。开展勤工俭学运动后，对脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系，有了正确认识，于是90％以上的学生都表示终身愿做护士。
    几个月来的勤工俭学运动，使学生们的体质大大增强。据很多学校的调查，都证明了学生参加勤工俭学活动后，他们的体重、肺活量、握力等方面都有增加。
    勤工俭学的开展，受到社会舆论的普遍赞扬，近两个多月来，全市已收到各方面的表扬信达一千四百五十六封，表示对勤工俭学的衷心拥护。
