Accompanied by Vice Mayor of Beijing Jia Tingsan, Vice Chairman Zhu De carefully viewed the various products at the exhibition. In the Chemical and Light Industry Hall, Beijing brand premium ink was displayed alongside American Parker brand ink. Vice Chairman Zhu De used a pen to write the words "中国" (China) with each ink. After comparing them, he said, "The Chinese one is better!" After seeing that the quality of Beijing Paint Factory's products this year was significantly better than last year, he said, "This is the result of the Great Leap Forward." The crepe striped fabric newly produced by Qianmen Weaving Factory is sturdy, beautiful, and sells for only 42 cents per foot. This product received Vice Chairman Zhu De's praise.

Vice Chairman Zhu De visited the rich and varied Work-Study Program Hall in great detail. He said that schools have many talents and much equipment, and factories and schools should be linked together.

    据新华社6日讯　朱德副主席昨晚参观了北京市地方工业生产跃进汇报展览会。
    朱德副主席在北京市副市长贾庭三陪同下，仔细地参观了展览会上的各种产品。在化工轻工馆里，陈列着北京牌高级墨水和美国的派克牌墨水，朱德副主席拿钢笔用这两种墨水各写了“中国”两字，经过比较，他说：“还是中国的好！”他看了北京市油漆厂今年的产品质量比去年有显著进步以后说，“这是大跃进的结果。”前门织布厂新产的绉纹条布，坚固美观，每尺只卖四角二分钱，这个产品受到朱德副主席的称赞。
    朱德副主席很详细地参观了内容丰富的勤工俭学馆。他说，学校人材多、设备多，工厂和学校应挂钩。
