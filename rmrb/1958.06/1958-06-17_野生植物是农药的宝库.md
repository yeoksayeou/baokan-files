In the struggle to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, Santai County, Sichuan Province, faced a shortage of pesticides. To solve this problem, the county's Party and government mobilized the masses to find many local methods and discovered that a large number of wild plants could kill insects. Consequently, a mass movement of agricultural cooperatives self-collecting and manufacturing pesticides was launched. The path taken by Santai County in solving the pesticide shortage once again proves an unbreakable truth: The broad masses, whose minds have been liberated in the Great Leap Forward, possess an invincible and enormous power, and any difficulty can be overcome.

A Correct Path

This year, diseases and insect pests of major spring crops such as rice, cotton, and sweet potatoes occurred more widely and were more severe than in previous years in Santai County. However, the county had a shortage of pesticides. Although the supply and marketing departments made great efforts, the pesticide supply was still no greater than in previous years. Taking Anju District as an example: the district needed more than 170,000 jin of pesticides, but the supply and marketing cooperative could only supply more than 50,000 jin, a large gap between demand and supply.

Under these circumstances, the Santai County Party Committee was determined to rely on its own efforts to solve the difficulty of pesticide shortages. In May, the county, district, and township levels each established a command organization for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, headed by a member of the Party committee and with the participation of personnel from relevant departments. They led rural work cadres to go deep into the townships and cooperatives, invited old farmers and rural doctors to hold discussions, explored local methods and local medicines for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, summarized the masses' experience in using local methods and local medicines to eliminate insects, and mobilized the masses to think boldly and act boldly. Soon, a wave of enthusiasm for everyone to come up with ideas and plans swept across the county. Thirty-one local methods and local medicines capable of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests such as aphids, spider mites, and rice stem borers were found.

Wild Plants are Rich in Pesticides

Among the wild plants found in Santai County that can be used as pesticides is *Calystegia hederacea*, locally called "Dawanhua," also known as wild cotton. In addition, there are walnut leaves, walnut husks, peach leaves, *Gelsemium elegans*, *Polygala japonica*, *Pinellia ternata*, tobacco, *Lysimachia capillipes*, *Alnus cremastogyne* leaves, *Artemisia apiacea*, *Loxostylis chinensis*, *Jatropha curcas*, *Melia azedarach* leaves, *Melia azedarach* fruits and bark, *Vitex negundo* leaves, *Vernicia fordii* shells, etc. These things can be collected in large quantities locally. For example, the *Melia azedarach* tree is a very common tree locally, found everywhere. In the past, people did not pay attention to it, but this time, several old farmers from Hongxing Second Cooperative in Anju Township told people that using its fresh leaves, chopped and soaked in juice, can eliminate cotton aphids and spider mites. The method is very simple: chop the fresh leaves and soak them in two to three times their weight in clean water for four to six hours, then filter out the residue. When using it, one jin of mother liquor can be mixed with half a jin of lime and ten jin of water and sprayed on cotton seedlings. For example, walnut trees are found in many places, and their shells and leaves can also be made into medicinal juice by boiling or soaking in clean water. When making walnut shell medicinal juice, add four jin of water to each jin of shells and boil for half an hour; it can prevent cabbage caterpillars.

The following are also worth special mention: *Alnus cremastogyne* trees, which often grow by rivers, ponds, and fields. In the past, local farmers used its leaves to kill pupae and fumigate bedbugs. It is not only a special medicine for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, but also a good thing to ensure a bumper harvest. *Polygala japonica* is a very poisonous grass. A herbal medicine doctor introduced to people: cut its roots into thin slices, add three to five times their weight in clean water, boil for one hour, and filter out the residue to make the mother liquor. When using it, add fifteen to twenty jin of clean water; it can poison all chewing-mouthpart pests. *Gelsemium elegans*, also known as *wuduoyun*, grows by ditches and canals. The emulsion made from it can eliminate aphids. *Lysimachia capillipes*, which grows in dark and humid places, was used by farmers in large quantities as green manure in the past. According to old farmers, it can eliminate underground pests just like *Calystegia hederacea*. Now, farmers collect it, chop it up, dry it on a kang, and make it into a powder. For every two liang of medicinal powder, add ninety jin of water and pour it next to the crops to kill all mole crickets.

Breaking Superstition, Cooperatives Self-Manufacturing

The Santai County Command Organization for the Prevention and Control of Diseases and Insect Pests collected, tested, and promoted the above-mentioned local methods and local medicines simultaneously. The results of trials in the Beita Agricultural Cooperative and Hongxing Second Cooperative showed that these local medicines were very effective in killing insects. *Melia azedarach* leaf emulsion, walnut leaf emulsion, *Pinellia ternata* emulsion, etc., all had insecticidal efficiencies of over 90%, while *Polygala japonica* emulsion, walnut shell emulsion, etc., were all over 80%. The efficiency of most of them was about the same as that of 1% 666 emulsion, and some were even more efficient.

After the news of the successful trials spread in a timely manner, the agricultural cooperatives were very enthusiastic about self-manufacturing local medicines. The farmers all said that this was completely in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results and running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Soon, all the agricultural cooperatives in the county took action. People were collecting medicines everywhere in the deep mountains and wilderness, and by the fields and canals. The Young Pioneers also had new content for their team day activities. They were led by experienced old farmers to identify various wild plants and collect them. The agricultural cooperatives collected, manufactured, and cooperated with each other, doing things very quickly. In a very short period of time, the county manufactured more than 100,000 jin of various local medicines and is still continuing to manufacture them. Now, the farmers of Santai County no longer worry about the lack of pesticides in their fight against insect pests, and the bumper harvest of spring crops is more reliably guaranteed.

In the manufacture and promotion of these pesticides, the supply and marketing cooperatives of Santai County played a very important role. Because the supply and marketing cooperatives passed on the methods of making medicines everywhere, now, many agricultural cooperatives in Santai County not only know how to use the above-mentioned wild plants to make pesticides, but also know how to manufacture lime-sulfur mixture, cotton oil soap, Bordeaux mixture, rosin mixture, egg oil emulsion, and other pesticides. Many farmers have learned the techniques of mixing and soaking, and they can manufacture them in large quantities with simple tools, using local materials, making them and using them as they go, and eliminating insect pests very promptly. The farmers proudly said: We have broken superstition, and we can also manufacture pesticides ourselves.

    野生植物是农药的宝库
    新华社记者　朱成
    四川省三台县在防治农作物病虫害的斗争中农药不足。为了解决这个问题，这个县的党和政府发动群众找到了很多土法，发现了大批野生植物可以杀虫，因而又发动了一个农业社自采自造农药的群众性运动。三台县在解决农药不足问题上所走的道路，再一次证明了一条颠簸不破的真理：在大跃进中解放了思想的广大群众，具有无坚不克的巨大力量，任何困难都可以克服。
    一条正确的道路
    今年三台县的水稻、棉花、甘薯等大春作物病虫害发生得比较普遍，比往年也严重。但是，这个县农药不足，供销部门虽然尽了很大的努力，农药进货仍不比往年多。以安居区为例：全区需要农药十七万多斤，而供销社只能供应五万多斤，需要量和供应量差得很远。
    在这种情况下，中共三台县委决心自力更生，发动群众解决农药不足的困难。5月间，县、区、乡都以党委的一个成员为主，吸收各有关部门的人员参加，成立了防治病虫害的指挥机构，领导农村工作干部深入乡社，邀请老农和农村医生座谈，发掘防治病虫害的土法土药，总结群众用土法土药除虫的经验，并且发动群众大胆地想和大胆地干，很快，全县就掀起了人人想法个个献计的热潮，找到了三十一种能够防治蚜虫、红蜘蛛、稻螟虫等病虫害的土法土药。
    野生植物农药多
    三台县发现的可作农药的野生植物中也有“打破碗花花”，当地叫“打碗花”，又名野棉花。此外还有核桃叶、核桃果皮、桃树叶、断肠草、九十九条根、生半夏、烟草、闷头花、山麻柳叶、桐蒿、苦艾、扁竹根、巴豆、苦楝子树叶、苦楝子和皮、臭黄荆叶、桐子壳等，这些东西当地可以大量采集。比如苦楝子树是当地很普通的树，到处都有。过去人们不重视它，这次安居乡红星二社的几位老农却告诉人们：用它的鲜叶切碎泡汁，就能消灭棉蚜和红蜘蛛。办法很简单，把鲜叶切碎用二到三倍的清水泡上四到六小时，然后滤去渣子就成了。使用的时候，一斤母液兑上半斤石灰和十斤水就可向棉苗上喷射。又如很多地方都有核桃树，它的果壳和叶子也可用煮或清水泡的办法制成药汁。制造核桃壳药汁的时候，每斤果壳加水四斤煮半小时就可以了，它能防治菜青虫。
    这里值得特别介绍的还有以下几种：山麻柳树，多长在河边、塘边和田边，过去当地农民就用它的叶子来杀蛹和熏臭虫。它既是除四害讲卫生的特效药，又是保证丰收的好东西。九十九条根是一种最毒的草。一位草药医生向人们介绍：把它的根部切成薄片，加上三至五倍的清水熬上一小时滤去渣子就成了母液，使用的时候再兑上十五到二十斤清水就成了，它能毒杀一切咀嚼式口器的害虫。断肠草，又名五朵云，长在沟边渠边，用它熬制成的乳剂可消灭蚜虫。生长在阴暗潮湿之处的闷头花，过去农民大量利用它作青肥。据老农民介绍，它和打碗花一样也能消灭地下害虫。现在，农民把它采集起来切碎炕干制成粉剂，每两药粉兑水九十斤，浇到农作物的旁边就能把地蚕全部杀死。
    打破迷信社社自造
    三台县防治病虫害的指挥机构，对于上述的土法土药是边搜集、边试验、边推广的。在北塔农业社和红星二社试验的结果表明，这些土药杀虫效率都很高。苦楝子树叶乳剂、核桃树叶乳剂、生半夏乳剂等等，杀虫效率都在90％以上，九十九条根乳剂、核桃壳乳剂等等都在80％以上。它们多数的效率都和1％的666乳剂差不多，有的效率更高。
    试验成功的消息及时传播以后，农业社自造土药的劲头很大。农民都说，这完全符合多快好省和勤俭办社的方针。很快全县各农业社都行动起来了，深山野岭和田旁渠边，到处都有采药的人。少先队过队日也有了新内容，他们由有经验的老农领着辨别各种野生植物，进行采集。各农业社采的采，制的制，分工协作，搞得飞快。全县在很短的时间内就制成了各种土药十几万斤，并且还在继续制造。现在，三台县农民和虫害作斗争再不愁缺农药了，大春作物的丰收有了比较可靠的保证。
    在这些农药的制造和推广方面，三台县的供销社起了极大的作用。由于供销社到处传授制药的办法，现在，三台县的许多农业社，不只会利用上述野生植物制农药，而且也会制造石灰硫磺合剂、棉油皂、波尔多液、松脂合剂、蛋油乳剂等农药。很多农民学会了调剂和泡制的技术，他们用简单的工具就能大批制造，就地取材，随造随用，除治虫害非常及时。农民自豪地说：打破了迷信，农药我们也能自己制造了。
