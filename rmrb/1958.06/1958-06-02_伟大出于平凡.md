Greatness Springs from the Ordinary

　　The Inventor of the Recording Machine

　　Cheng Jiayin was a mechanical manufacturer in China in the 18th century. He once created a "message-sending tube." Inside the tube, every inch or so, there was a gate. After a person finished speaking into the tube, they would close the gate. If the gates were opened in sequence, one could hear the original words spoken. It is said that the voice could be preserved for a hundred days without dissipating. The original record is not very clear, but this must have utilized acoustic principles in physics. At that time, Western physics knowledge had not yet been introduced to China, so Cheng Jiayin's invention was very great. Cheng Jiayin also made many other machines, but unfortunately, he died at a young age, and even his inventions were lost.

　　Mathematical Theorist Wang Lai

　　Wang Lai, born from 1768 to 1813, was a Chinese mathematician. At the age of thirty-three, he published a theory on finding the roots of equations in mathematics. This theory was exactly the same as that invented by Descartes in Europe. Although Descartes' invention was more than a hundred years before Wang Lai, it had not been introduced to China at that time. Wang Lai's invention was entirely the result of his own research.

　　A Person Who Dared to Revolutionize Celestial Bodies

　　In the 1470s, everyone in Europe—whether pope, emperor, or the lowest commoner—believed that the Earth was stationary. However, the German Copernicus boldly proposed that the Sun was stationary and the Earth revolved around the Sun. In his book "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres," he scientifically demonstrated the movements of the planets.

　　After Copernicus's theory was published, people did not immediately believe him. On the contrary, most people ridiculed Copernicus as a arrogant madman and a heretic, violating God's will and what was recorded in the Bible. However, science has long proved that it was not Copernicus who was foolish but some people who were superstitious about God.

　　Apprentice Becomes an Electrical Master

　　Faraday (1791-1867) was a famous British electrical master, the first person to discover induced current. Thanks to this discovery, it became possible for mankind to universally and massively utilize electrical energy.

　　Faraday's father was a blacksmith. Due to family financial difficulties, Faraday became an apprentice at a bookstore at the age of thirteen. In his spare time from work, he studied diligently. He was most interested in scientific works, such as "Chemical Catechism" and "Electrical Experiments."

　　He not only loved to read, but also valued experimentation. Although his income was meager, he still managed to buy some instruments to conduct experiments. Even after he became famous in the scientific community, he continued to immerse himself in experiments. At that time, there was much discussion in the scientific community about the classification of electricity. Many people wanted to classify it according to the source of electricity. But they were only discussing it verbally and did not conduct experiments on this issue. Faraday, however, experimented with electricity from various sources, proving that electricity from each source produced the same phenomena and could not be classified. Therefore, Faraday came to the conclusion: "No matter what the source of electricity, its properties are always the same."

　　Due to his emphasis on practice and extensive reading, Faraday, who had never attended school, finally discovered many scientific truths.

　　伟大出于平凡
    录音机的发明者
    程嘉荫是我国十八世纪的一个机械制造家。他曾创造了一个“寄话筒”。筒内每隔一寸多有一个闸，人向筒讲完话后便把闸关闭。如果按次序地把闸打开就可以听到原来所讲的话。据说话声可以保留百天不散。原记载不很清楚，但这必定利用了物理学上声学的原理。当时西洋物理学知识还没有传到我国来，所以程嘉荫的发明是很伟大的。程嘉荫还做了许多其他机械，不幸年岁很轻便死去，连他的发明也失传了。
    数学理论家汪莱
    汪莱生于1768年至1813年，是我国的数学家。他在三十三岁时发表了数学上方程论求根的理论。这理论和欧洲笛卡儿发明的完全相同。虽然笛卡儿发明在汪莱前一百多年，当时并没有传入我国，汪莱这个发明完全是他自己研究得来的。
    勇于向天体革命的人
    十五世纪七十年代，欧洲所有的人——无论是教皇、皇帝，或是最低级的平民，都认为地球是停着不动的。但是，当时的日耳曼人哥白尼，大胆地提出了太阳是不动的，而地球围绕着太阳转动。在他作的“天体的革命”一书中，科学地论证了行星的行动。
    哥白尼的这种理论发表后，人们并没有马上相信他，相反地，一般人都讥笑哥白尼是狂妄之徒和异端，违背上帝的意旨和圣经上所记载的。但是，科学早已证明愚蠢的不是哥白尼而是一些迷信上帝的人。
    学徒成了电学大师
    法拉第（1791—1867）是英国著名的电学大师，是第一个发现感应电流的人。由于这个发现，人类才有可能普遍地大量利用电能。
    法拉第的父亲是个铁匠，由于家庭经济困难，法拉第从十三岁起就到书店当学徒。他在工作之余，便努力读书。他最感兴趣的是有关科学的著作，如“化学问答”，“电学实验”等书。
    他不仅喜爱读书，还重视实验。虽然他的收入很少，但是还是设法买一些仪器来进行实验。直到他在科学界已经成名以后，还是不断地埋头作实验。当时，科学界对于电的分类问题讨论很多，许多人都想按照电的来源而分类。但是他们都只是在口头上讨论，没有就这个问题作作实验。法拉第却将各种来源的电加以试验，证明每种来源的电，都产生同样的现象，分不出什么类来。因此法拉第下了一个结论：“无论什么来源的电，它的性质总是相同的。”
    由于重视实践和广泛阅读书籍，没有上过学的法拉第，终于发现了不少科学上的真理。
