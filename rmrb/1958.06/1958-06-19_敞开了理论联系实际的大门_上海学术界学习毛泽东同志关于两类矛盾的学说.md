Opened the Door to Integrating Theory with Practice
Shanghai Academic Circles Study Comrade Mao Zedong's Theory on Two Types of Contradictions

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai's social science circles, in the process of discussing Chairman Mao's theory on two types of contradictions, have been integrating theory with practice, using this theory to analyze and study problems in actual struggles. More and more professional workers and the masses of workers have broken down the view of academic mystery and stepped onto the platform of academic discussion. This has opened up a broad path for how academic research can be further integrated with actual struggles and how it can serve socialist construction.

    Since February and March of this year, when the anti-Rightist struggle achieved a basic victory and the rectification and "double-anti" movements began to deepen, Shanghai's academic circles (including philosophy, economics, education, history, law, linguistics, etc.) have successively conducted heated discussions on Chairman Mao's theory on two types of contradictions and the academic research policy of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past. Recently, to commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," various social science societies have held several symposia and discussion meetings one after another, launching a surge of studying the theory of two types of contradictions. Many research articles have also been published in "Academic Monthly."

    This study upsurge, which has lasted for several months and focused on the discussion of the theory of two types of contradictions, has shown two characteristics. One is that social scientists generally use this theory as their ideological guide in the process of learning and discussion. Some people have also started from their understanding of the actual situation in a certain agency, factory, or school regarding rectification, the "double-anti," production, and teaching, and put forward their own experiences and opinions on various internal contradictions, initially changing the past tendencies of closed-door research, detachment from reality, emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, getting entangled in noun concepts, and engaging in scholarship for the sake of scholarship. Lu Zhenming, a professor at the First Normal School, linked the fact that the school solved the contradictions between leaders and the led, and between individuals and collectives through heart-to-heart talks, and explained the great power of the theory of two types of contradictions in practical life.

    Many academic research workers have also combined their own ideological situation to examine and criticize their own bourgeois individualism and bourgeois academic thinking. Professor Zhou Xuliang of East China Normal University said that when the Rightists attacked the Party, he published "Starting from the Chapter on Plants and Trees" in Wenhui Daily, emphasizing "Don't be surprised by anything strange, and the strange will disappear on its own," believing that any satire should be allowed, which was essentially defending the Rightists. Only after reading Chairman Mao's article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" did he suddenly realize the errors in his thinking. Through these discussions, people in academic circles have felt the importance and urgency of ideological remolding for bourgeois intellectuals even more.

    Another characteristic shown in the discussion of the theory of two types of contradictions is that more and more professional workers and workers with rich practical experience have broken down the view of academic mystery, joined the academic ranks, and stepped onto the platform of academic discussion. In the process of discussion, Shanghai's social science circles invited some district party secretaries, factory party secretaries, staff members from business departments such as industry and commerce, labor, and taxation, and teachers from universities and middle schools to participate in the discussion, which greatly helped solve theoretical problems. For example, regarding the question of "why is the current main contradiction in our country prominently manifested between the superstructure and the foundation," the academic circles discussed it for a long time without getting to the point. However, at the recent symposium held by the Philosophical Society and the Economic Society, the staff members of the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission, the Commercial Bureau, the Industrial Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, and the Labor and Wage Bureau, based on the theory of two types of contradictions, focused on the problems existing in Shanghai's industrial and commercial relations, production and sales relations, labor wages, and tax system, and the relationship between Shanghai's industry and inland industry. Combining their actual work, they specifically and vividly explained what contradictions actually exist between today's superstructure and the economic base, the forms of manifestation of the contradictions, the correct methods for resolving these contradictions, and the great role of timely resolving these contradictions in promoting the development of productive forces. The deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Qiuxin Shipyard, who first established a philosophy group among workers and now has 22 philosophy groups, also participated in the discussion and introduced the situation of the factory's workers breaking superstitions, learning philosophy, and using philosophy to connect with reality to solve ideological and work problems.

    The participation of this new force in Shanghai's academic circles swept away the past dull, tedious, and empty academic atmosphere. Many academic workers believe that the speeches of people engaged in practical work have given them great education and enlightenment. Some people have also combined this with examining their past ideas of belittling the masses and belittling practice. To get out of the study, get out of the classroom, establish the revolutionary outlook on life of the working class, go to the workers and peasants and into practice, conduct investigations and research, and summarize experience, can theory be closely combined with practice, and theory can play a role in guiding practice.

    敞开了理论联系实际的大门
    上海学术界学习毛泽东同志关于两类矛盾的学说
    本报讯　上海市社会科学界在讨论毛主席关于两类矛盾学说的过程中，理论联系实际，运用这个学说分析研究实际斗争中的问题。越来越多的业务工作者和工人群众打破了学术神秘的观点，走上了学术讨论的讲台。这给学术研究如何进一步和实际斗争相结合，如何为社会主义建设服务，找到了一条广阔的道路。
    从今年2、3月起，上海学术界（包括哲学、经济学、教育学、历史学、法学、语言学等方面）在反右斗争取得基本胜利、整风和双反运动开始走向深入的时候，就开始对毛主席关于两类矛盾的学说和厚今薄古的学术研究方针，相继进行了热烈的讨论。最近，为纪念毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年，社会科学的各个学会，又陆续举行了数次座谈会和讨论会，掀起了学习两类矛盾学说的热潮，在“学术月刊”上也发表了许多研究的文章。
    这个持续数月以讨论两类矛盾学说为中心的学习热潮，出现了两个特点，一个是社会科学家们在学习和讨论过程中，一般都能以这个学说作为自己的思想指导。有些人还从自己深入一个机关、一个工厂、一个学校所了解到的关于整风、双反、生产和教学等方面的实际情况出发，对各种内部矛盾提出自己的体会和看法，初步改变了过去关门研究、脱离实际、重古轻今、纠缠名词概念、为学术而学术的倾向。第一师范学院教授陆贞明联系本校通过交心运动解决领导与被领导、个人与集体之间矛盾的事实，说明两类矛盾学说在实际生活中所发挥的巨大力量。
    许多学术研究工作者还结合自己的思想情况，对自己的资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级学术思想进行了检查和批判。华东师范大学周煦良教授说他在右派向党进攻时，曾在文汇报上发表“从草木篇说起”，强调“见怪不怪，其怪自败”，认为任何讽刺都应允许，实质上是为右派辩护；直到看了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文章后，才恍悟到自己思想上的错误。通过这些讨论，学术界人士更感到了资产阶级知识分子思想改造的重要性和迫切性。
    在讨论两类矛盾学说中所表现出的另一特点，是有越来越多的具有丰富实践经验的业务工作者和工人群众打破了学术神秘的观点，参加了学术队伍，走上了学术讨论的讲坛。在讨论过程中，上海社会科学界邀请了一些区委书记、工厂党委书记，工商、劳动、税务等业务部门的工作人员，大中学校的教师参加讨论，对解决理论问题大有帮助。如对“当前我国主要矛盾为什么突出地表现在上层建筑和基础之间”这个问题，学术界讨论很久，不得要领。但在最近哲学会、经济学会举行的座谈会上，参加座谈会的上海市计划委员会、商业局、工业局、税务局、劳动工资局的工作人员，根据两类矛盾的学说，分别就上海市的工商关系、产销关系、劳动工资、税收制度，上海工业和内地工业的关系等方面所存在的问题，结合他们本部门实际工作情况，具体而又生动地说明了今天的上层建筑同经济基础之间究竟存在一些什么矛盾，矛盾的表现形式，解决这些矛盾的正确方法，以及及时解决了这些矛盾，对于推动生产力发展的巨大作用。在工人中首先成立了哲学小组，现在已拥有二十二个哲学小组的求新造船厂党委副书记也参加了讨论会，并介绍了该厂工人打破迷信学习哲学，运用哲学联系实际解决思想问题和工作问题的情况。
    上海学术界这支生力军的参加讨论，一扫学术界过去沉闷烦琐，空洞无物的学究气氛。许多学术工作者认为从事实际工作者的发言，给他们的教育启发很大。有人还结合检查自己过去轻视群众、轻视实践的思想。要走出书斋，走出课堂，树立工人阶级的革命人生观，到工农群众中和实践中去，调查研究，总结经验，才能把理论和实践密切地结合起来，理论也才能起到指导实践的作用。（陈向东）
