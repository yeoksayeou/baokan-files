Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 12th: Hong Kong trade associations and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of protest to the British Chargé d'Affaires regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' interference and prohibition of Hong Kong Chinese residents from displaying the national flag and singing the national anthem, and refuted the Hong Kong British authorities' public statement distorting the facts.

Following the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest note on June 10th, the Hong Kong British authorities issued a public statement on the 11th, reiterating their attitude of interfering with Hong Kong Chinese residents displaying the Chinese national flag, using the excuse that displaying the national flag could "stir up trouble" and so-called "concern" for "peace and order."

On the evening of June 11th, the Hong Kong motorcycle industry workers held a protest meeting attended by 1,000 people. The chairman of the meeting, in his speech, angrily condemned the Hong Kong Education Department's unreasonable measures to interfere with Hong Kong Chinese residents displaying the Chinese national flag and expressed enthusiastic support for our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' solemn protest to the British government on this matter. He pointed out that this practice of the Hong Kong British authorities infringing on the patriotic rights of Chinese compatriots has already drawn the attention of more than 600 million Chinese people. The various excuses made by the Hong Kong authorities in their public statement for interfering with Chinese residents displaying the national flag are completely reversing right and wrong.

The Hong Kong Swatow Importers and Exporters Association, the Fung Kwai Tong Egg Merchants Association, and the Yee On Association, and other organizations held council meetings on the 11th. Speakers at these meetings unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note. The Fung Kwai Tong Egg Merchants Association also issued a statement saying that the Hong Kong authorities' public statement claiming that displaying the national flag could disrupt peace is a complete distortion of the facts and ignores the true meaning of our compatriots displaying the national flag.

Many members of the public also expressed enthusiastic support for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note. Tang Bingda, treasurer of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Zhuang Chengzong, chairman of the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, Wu Renhuai, chairman of the Fujian Chamber of Commerce, Chen Xunyu, chairman of the Swatow Importers and Exporters Association, Li Jingxi, chairman of the Chinese Vegetable Oil Exporters Association, and film industry figures Zhu Shilin and Yuan Yang'an, all gave interviews to newspaper reporters on the 11th, supporting our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' solemn protest and pointing out that the Hong Kong British authorities' subsequent public statement was sophistry.

    香港各业社团和各界人士
    拥护外交部向英国代办的抗议
    新华社香港12日电　香港各业社团和各界人士热烈拥护外交部就香港英国当局干涉和禁止香港中国居民悬挂国旗和唱国歌事件给英国代办的抗议照会，并驳斥香港英国当局歪曲事实的公报。
    外交部6月10日的抗议照会发表后，香港英国当局为此在11日发表公报，借口悬挂国旗足以“激起事端”，以及所谓“关心”“安宁和秩序”，重申干涉香港中国居民悬挂中国国旗的态度。
    香港摩托车业工人11日晚上举行了有一千人参加的抗议大会，大会主席在发言中，愤怒地谴责香港教育司干涉香港中国居民悬挂中国国旗的无理措施，并且表示热烈拥护我国外交部就这件事向英国政府提出的严正抗议。他指出，香港英国当局这种侵犯中国同胞爱国权利的做法，已经引起六亿多中国人民的注视。香港当局的公报中为干涉中国居民悬挂国旗而找的各种借口，完全是颠倒是非的。
    香港汕头进出口商会、丰贵堂蛋业商会和义安公社等团体，11日分别举行了理事会议，在这些会议上发言的人对我国外交部的照会一致表示热烈拥护。丰贵堂蛋业商会并发表声明说：香港当局发表的公报中认为悬挂国旗足以破坏安宁一节，完全是歪曲事实，抹煞我同胞悬挂国旗的真正意义。
    许多社会人士也表示热烈拥护外交部的照会。香港中华总商会司库汤秉达、福建同乡会理事长庄成宗、福建商会理事长吴仁怀、汕头进出口商会理事会陈逊予、中国植物油出口商会理事长李景熙和电影界人士朱石麟、袁仰安等都在11日向报纸记者发表谈话，拥护我国外交部的严正抗议，并且指出香港英国当局事后的公报是强词夺理的。
