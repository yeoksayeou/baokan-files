　　Fertilizer and Fertilization
　　Deng Xiliu
    The growth of crops requires the absorption of a lot of nutrients from the outside world. According to scientific research, there are about seventy elements that make up a plant organism. Any substance that can supply the nutrients needed for crop growth, improve soil fertility, and directly or indirectly benefit crop growth, thereby increasing crop yield and the quality of agricultural products, can be called fertilizer. In fertilization, fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter are of universal significance.
    Nitrogen is the main component of protein, and protein contains 16%-18% nitrogen. Protein is the material basis of plant life processes. Therefore, without nitrogen, there would be no plant life. At the same time, nitrogen also exists in chlorophyll. When the nitrogen fertilizer supply is sufficient, crops grow luxuriantly and the leaves are dark green. Lack of nitrogen slows down the formation of chlorophyll, the leaves turn yellow, the production of nutrients inside the plant decreases, the plant is short, the branches and leaves are not lush, there are fewer tillers, and the yield is low. However, excessive or improper application of nitrogen fertilizer (such as applying it too late) will cause crops to grow excessively and become weak, making them prone to lodging and pests and diseases, and will also delay maturity.
    Phosphorus is the main component of the cell nucleus. Phosphorus can help the growth of young buds and young roots, promote the development of seedlings, and also promote various metabolic processes in plants, making crops bloom and bear fruit earlier. If phosphorus fertilizer is insufficient, the roots of crops will not grow well; the stems and leaves often appear red, purple, or reddish-brown; flowering is late and the flowers are weak; maturity is late; the germination power of the seeds is weak; the fruits grow small, with less juice and poor sweetness; and the quality of agricultural products is reduced.
    Potassium is closely related to the formation of carbohydrates. When potassium is insufficient, the intensity of plant photosynthesis is weakened and the starch content is reduced. Without potassium, plants cannot form starch. Potassium can make crops grow strong, the stems and leaves are tough, and they are not easy to lodge; enhance the resistance of crops to diseases; and grow plump seeds. Crops lack potassium fertilizer, the stems grow weak and are easy to lodge; the roots are poorly developed and prone to root rot; the tips and edges of the leaves turn yellow, turn brown, and finally dry up and die; the plants are short; and the seeds are also small.
    Animal manure, corpses, and plant roots, stems, and leaves all contain organic matter. After organic matter rots in the soil, it produces a dark brown, gluey substance called humus. Humus can make soil particles stick together, form a granular structure, increase the soil's ability to retain moisture and nutrients, and improve soil fertility. It is an indispensable thing in the soil. Usually, the organic matter contained in the soil is not much, and it is often consumed and reduced, so it needs to be supplemented by fertilization.
    According to scientific research and production practice experience in various places, under the current production and fertilization level, arable land soil in my country generally lacks organic matter and nitrogen. Applying nitrogen fertilizer can increase production; phosphorus is more lacking in the Yangtze River Basin and its southern regions; potassium is generally not lacking. Therefore, in my country's fertilization problem, we must first focus on increasing the application of organic matter and nitrogen fertilizer, followed by phosphorus fertilizer, and then potassium fertilizer.
    My country's fertilizer resources are extremely rich, and there are many types of fertilizers used, roughly estimated to be about one or two hundred kinds. Distinguished from the source and nature of fertilizers, they can be roughly divided into two categories: organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers.
    Organic Fertilizers and Their Characteristics
    Organic fertilizers. The main ones are human and animal manure, farmyard manure, green manure, etc. Generally speaking, the characteristics of organic fertilizers are: (1) They contain complete fertilizer components, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and also contain organic matter, which not only provides nutrients for crops, but also has the effect of improving the soil and increasing soil fertility. Therefore, fertilization must be based on organic fertilizers. (2) Organic fertilizers need to undergo fermentation and changes before the fertilizer components they contain can be absorbed and utilized by crops, so the fertilizer effect is generally relatively slow, but the fertilizer effect is longer.
    (1) Human and animal manure: According to research by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the amount of feces and urine excreted by an adult in a year and the amount of fertilizer components contained are shown in the following table:
　　Feces and urine
　　Human feces
　　Human urine
　　Total
　　Amount excreted by an adult per year
　　180 jin
　　1400 jin
　　1580 jin
　　Content per 100 jin
　　Nitrogen
　　1 jin
　　8 liang
　　Phosphoric acid
　　8 liang
　　2 liang
　　Potassium oxide
　　6 liang
　　3 liang
　　Amount of fertilizer components excreted by an adult per year
　　Nitrogen
　　1 jin
　　13 liang
　　7 jin
　　8 jin
　　13 liang
　　Phosphoric acid
    14 liang
　　1 jin 12 liang
　　2 jin 10 liang
　　Potassium oxide
    11 liang
　　2 jin 10 liang
　　3 jin 5 liang
    From the above table, it can be seen that human and animal manure contains more nitrogen and less phosphorus and potassium. The fertilizer content in feces is thicker than that in urine; however, from the annual excretion amount, the amount of human urine is much larger than the amount of human feces, and the total fertilizer content is also much higher, so special attention should be paid to the accumulation and utilization of human urine.
    The fertilizer effect of human and animal manure is very good. The feces and urine of an adult in a year used as fertilizer can increase grain production by 100 to 150 jin and seed cotton by 50 to 60 jin.
    Human and animal manure must be decomposed before it can be applied. Human and animal manure are easy to decompose, especially human urine decomposes quickly. Single human urine can be applied without decomposition. The nitrogen fertilizer contained in decomposed human and animal manure is easily volatilized and lost, so attention should be paid to preventing the loss of fertilizer components when storing human and animal manure. Do not pour grass ash into human and animal manure, so as not to promote the volatilization of nitrogen fertilizer in human and animal manure.
    The fertilizer effect of human and animal manure is relatively fast, suitable for topdressing, and can also be used as base fertilizer. Generally, 1,000 to 2,000 jin can be applied per mu, and it is best to apply it in several times, not too much at one time, so as not to lose fertilizer components. In dry land, when used as a base fertilizer, it can be applied to the side of the sowing ditch or hole during sowing, covered with soil after application, and then sown; when used as topdressing, it can be applied by opening ditches or digging holes next to the plant and covering it with soil after application. In paddy fields, when used as a base fertilizer, it should be evenly applied to the dry soil that has been tilled before irrigation and harrowing, and then irrigated and harrowed; or when transplanting rice seedlings, it can be used to dip the seedling roots or stuff the seedling roots. When used as topdressing, if the water source is convenient, it is best to drain the field water before application, harrow it after application to mix the manure and urine with the soil, and then irrigate it after one or two days to allow the manure and urine to penetrate into the soil and be fully absorbed by the soil. In areas where water sources are difficult, it can also be applied without draining the water; but do not drain the water within a week after application to avoid loss of fertilizer components.
    (2) Farmyard manure: The mixture of livestock manure and the bedding grass or dry soil paved in the pens is called farmyard manure. The "pen manure" said by farmers in the north and the "fence manure" said by farmers in the south are all farmyard manure.
    Livestock excrete a large amount of feces and urine, which contain a lot of fertilizer components. For example, a cow excretes 20,000 jin of feces and urine a year, containing about 80 jin of nitrogen; a horse excretes 15,000 jin, containing about 90 jin of nitrogen; a pig excretes 4,000 jin, containing about 15 jin of nitrogen; a sheep excretes 1,500 jin, containing about 15 jin of nitrogen; at the same time, livestock manure also contains phosphorus and potassium fertilizer components. Livestock manure contains about 15%-25% organic matter, so farmyard manure is an important source of organic matter for the soil. According to experience in various places, the manure produced by a pig in a year used as fertilizer can increase grain production by 200 jin to 300 jin.
    Horse manure, mule manure, and donkey manure are coarse and loose in texture, contain less water, are easy to ferment, have a high heating temperature, and have a relatively fast fertilizer effect, so they are called "hot manure". Cattle manure is fine in texture, contains a lot of water, ferments slowly, has a low heating temperature, and has a slow fertilizer effect, so it is called "cold manure". Pig manure is similar in nature to cattle manure and also belongs to cold manure, but the fertilizer effect is faster than that of cattle manure.
    Farmyard manure must be composted and decomposed before it can be applied. When composting farmyard manure, it should be sealed to avoid sun and rain, which will cause loss of fertilizer components. The fertilizer effect of farmyard manure is slow, but it is durable and suitable for use as a base fertilizer. Generally, 2,000 to 4,000 jin can be applied per mu. When preparing the land, transport the farmyard manure to the field, spread it evenly on the field surface, and then immediately plow it into the soil to avoid fertilizer dispersion. Farmyard manure can be applied to various soils and crops, especially to clay soils and sandy soils.
    (3) Green manure: Any green and tender plant stems and leaves that are directly plowed and buried in the field as fertilizer are called "green manure". There are two sources of green manure: one is natural wild, and the other is artificially planted.
    There are many kinds of green manure crops cultivated in my country, about 20 or 30 kinds, mainly winter green manure crops, among which purple vetch, vetch, and golden flower cabbage are the most common. 1,000 jin of fresh vetch or golden flower cabbage stems and leaves contain about 5 jin of nitrogen; at the same time, they also contain phosphorus, potassium nutrients, and a large amount of organic matter. Therefore, planting green manure can not only increase fertilizer, but also improve the soil and increase soil fertility. As the proverb in the south of the Yangtze River says: "Plant grass seeds for three years, and bad fields will become good fields." According to a survey by the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, applying 1,500 jin of purple vetch to one mu of paddy field can increase rice production by about 50 jin.
    If winter green manure crops are well cultivated and managed, one mu of land can produce more than 10,000 jin of fresh grass, which can be used for several mu of fields.
    Green manure crops should be plowed in time. Purple vetch and golden flower cabbage should be plowed in the full bloom period, and vetch should be plowed in the initial flowering period. At this time, the yield of stems and leaves is high, the fertilizer content is also high, and the stems and leaves are not old and easy to rot. At the same time, the plowing period should be closely combined with the rice transplanting period, which is not good if it is too early or too late.
    Green manure such as purple vetch should be used as a base fertilizer. Generally, 2,000 to 3,000 jin can be applied per mu. When plowing, some lime can be applied to accelerate the decomposition of green manure and neutralize the acidity produced during the decomposition of green manure.
    Inorganic Fertilizers and Their Characteristics
    Inorganic fertilizers. The main ones are nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus fertilizer, potassium fertilizer, etc. Generally speaking, the characteristics of inorganic fertilizers, especially chemical fertilizers, are: 1. The fertilizer content is high and the momentum is great; 2. The fertilizer effect is fast; 3. The fertilizer content is simple, mostly containing only one or two fertilizer components; 4. Does not contain organic matter. Therefore, inorganic fertilizers should be used in combination with organic fertilizers and should not be used alone.
    (1) Nitrogen fertilizer: At present, the inorganic chemical nitrogen fertilizers used in my country include the following:
　　Name
　　Ammonium sulfate
　　Ammonium chloride
　　Ammonium thionitrate
　　Ammonium nitrate
　　Calcium ammonium nitrate
　　Urea
    Lime nitrogen

    Nature
　　Fast-acting, acidic
　　Fast-acting, acidic
　　Fast-acting, acidic
　　Fast-acting, neutral
　　Fast-acting, alkaline
　　Slightly slower, neutral
　　Slow-acting, alkaline
    Among these nitrogen fertilizers, the most used and most common is ammonium sulfate. The application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer in my country is generally effective, and the effect of increasing production is significant. One jin of ammonium sulfate can generally increase grain production by 3 to 5 jin and seed cotton by 1 to 2 jin.
    Ammonium sulfate and urea are suitable for general soils and crops, and are suitable for paddy fields and dry land. The nitrogen fertilizer contained in ammonium nitrate and calcium ammonium nitrate is easily lost in paddy fields and is not suitable for application to rice. The effect of application to dry crops is very good. Ammonium chloride is not suitable for application to flue-cured tobacco, sugar crops, potato crops and fruit trees, because it contains chlorine, which will affect the quality of these agricultural products. Lime nitrogen is most suitable for application to acidic soils.
    Ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium thionitrate, ammonium nitrate, and calcium ammonium nitrate are all soluble in water, can be directly absorbed and utilized by crops, and have a fast fertilizer effect; although the fertilizer effect of urea is slightly slower for a few days, they are most suitable for use as topdressing (apply in small amounts in several times), but can also be used as base fertilizer. Ammonium sulfate can also be used to dip rice seedling roots and as seed fertilizer for dry land wheat.
    Topdressing application method. In dry land, ditches or holes can be opened 3 or 4 cun away from the crop plant, ammonium sulfate is applied, and soil is covered after application. The method of topdressing in rice fields is similar to that of using human and animal manure.
    Ammonium nitrate is easy to agglomerate. For agglomerated ammonium nitrate, gently grind it before application, or dissolve it in water. Do not hit it violently to avoid explosion hazards. Improper storage of ammonium nitrate may also cause combustion.
    The nitrogen fertilizer contained in lime nitrogen must undergo decomposition and changes before it can be absorbed and utilized by crops, and the fertilizer effect is slow; at the same time, lime nitrogen will produce things that are harmful to crop growth during the decomposition process, so it should generally be applied as a base fertilizer, applied to the field 10 to 15 days before sowing or transplanting rice seedlings. Lime nitrogen is toxic, and poisoning should be prevented during transportation and application.
    Ammonium sulfate, ammonium thionitrate, and ammonium chloride are all acidic fertilizers. When applied to acidic soils, lime needs to be applied to neutralize their acidity. However, lime and grass ash should not be mixed and applied at the same time to avoid chemical changes and loss of their nitrogen fertilizer.
    (2) Phosphorus fertilizer: At present, the inorganic phosphorus fertilizers used in my country include the following:
    Name
    Superphosphate
    Triple superphosphate (also called triple superphosphate)
    Fused phosphate fertilizer
    Thomas phosphate fertilizer
    Phosphate content per 100 jin (jin)
    18—20
    45—46

　　General application rate per mu (jin)

    Nature
    Fast-acting, acidic
    Fast-acting, acidic
    Slow-acting, alkaline
    Slow-acting, alkaline
　　Most slow-acting, alkaline
    Among these phosphorus fertilizers, the most used is superphosphate. Usually, one jin of superphosphate can increase grain production by 1.5 to 2 jin and seed cotton by 0.5 to 1 jin.
    The phosphoric acid contained in superphosphate can be dissolved in water and has a fast fertilizer effect. A disadvantage of powdered superphosphate is that when it comes into contact with substances such as iron, aluminum, and lime in the soil, its water-soluble phosphoric acid is easily combined with these substances to form water-insoluble compounds such as iron phosphate, aluminum phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. As a result, crops cannot absorb and utilize those phosphoric acid fertilizer components, and the fertilizer effect of superphosphate is greatly reduced. Therefore, powdered superphosphate should be mixed with organic fertilizers (such as farmyard manure, compost, etc.) and used in a concentrated manner, or made into granular fertilizers for application, and direct spreading is strictly prohibited.
    Superphosphate can be applied to general soils and crops, especially to phosphorus-deficient soils, and to fields where crops such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanuts, and green manure are planted.
    Superphosphate is best used as a base fertilizer, and can also be used as topdressing. Used as a base fertilizer: In paddy fields, when transplanting rice seedlings, mix about 5 jin of superphosphate with decomposed organic fertilizer per mu to dip the seedling roots; in dry land, mix it with organic fertilizer and apply it in a concentrated manner in the sowing ditch or hole, cover the soil first and then sow. Used as topdressing: In paddy fields, it can be strip-applied between rice plants, or plugged next to rice plants; in dry land, it should be applied in ditches or holes 3 or 4 cun deep 3 or 4 cun away from the crop plant.
    Triple superphosphate (also called triple superphosphate) has the same properties as superphosphate and the same usage. However, its fertilizer content is higher, so pay attention to the dosage and do not use it to dip seedling roots.
    Thomas phosphate fertilizer, fused phosphate fertilizer, and phosphate rock powder are all suitable for application to acidic soils. The phosphoric acid they contain is not soluble in water. After being applied to the soil, it needs to be dissolved by the action of organic acids before it can be absorbed and utilized by crops, so the fertilizer effect is slow. It should be composted with organic fertilizer and applied as a base fertilizer, and should not be used as topdressing.
    (3) Potassium fertilizer: Most farmers in my country use stalks, weeds, branches, etc. as fuel. The grass ash left after burning is used as fertilizer, which is an important source of potassium fertilizer in rural areas.
    Usually, 100 jin of grass ash contains about 5 jin of potassium fertilizer, 2 jin of phosphorus fertilizer, and also contains lime. The potassium fertilizer contained in grass ash is mainly potassium carbonate, which can be dissolved in water and has a fast fertilizer effect. It can be used as base fertilizer or topdressing. General soils and crops are suitable for application, and 100 to 200 jin can be applied per mu. Applying grass ash to rice seedling fields can not only supply potassium, but also play a role in keeping warm and reducing the phenomenon of rotten seedlings caused by low temperature.
    Grass ash should be stored separately and avoided from wind and rain to avoid loss of fertilizer components.
    Things to pay attention to when fertilizing
    Some people think that as long as more fertilizer is applied, production can be increased. This is incorrect. Blindly applying more fertilizer will not only fail to increase production, but will often cause a decrease in production.
    So, what should we pay attention to when fertilizing?
    When applying fertilizer, you must first know the nature of the fertilizer, whether it is organic fertilizer or inorganic fertilizer; whether it is nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus fertilizer, or potassium fertilizer. These fertilizers should be used in combination to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. When applying fertilizer, you must also know how much fertilizer content the fertilizer contains. If the fertilizer content is high, the amount applied should be small; if the fertilizer content is low, the amount applied should be large. When applying fertilizer, you must also know the speed of the fertilizer effect. Fertilizers with slow effects should be applied early, and fertilizers with fast effects can be applied when crops need fertilizer.
    When applying fertilizer, you must look at the soil conditions. Generally speaking, less fertilizer can be applied to fertile land, and more fertilizer should be applied to poor land. Sandy soil has loose soil particles and weak fertilizer retention capacity. Nutrients are easily lost, so more organic fertilizer should be applied; when applying fast-acting fertilizers, they should be applied in several times and in small amounts. Clay soil has a tight soil texture and is not easy to seep water and ventilate. Fertilizers are not easy to decompose, so well-decomposed organic fertilizers should be applied. Saline-alkali soil should be applied with more green manure, farmyard manure, and compost, which can reduce alkali damage. Acidic soils generally lack nutrients such as phosphorus and calcium, so attention should be paid to the application of phosphorus fertilizer and lime.
    When applying fertilizer, you must look at the type of crop. Different crops have different fertilizer requirements, some need more nitrogen fertilizer, and some need more phosphorus fertilizer or potassium fertilizer. The same type of crop has different fertilizer tolerance due to different varieties. The same crop has different fertilizer requirements due to different yields. For example, producing 200 jin of cereal grains requires about 5.3 jin of nitrogen, 2.7 jin of phosphoric acid, and 5.3 jin of potassium oxide; producing 400 jin of cereal grains requires about 13.3 jin of nitrogen, 5.3 jin of phosphoric acid, and 12 jin of potassium oxide.
    Fertilizer should be applied in time. Topdressing too early or too late is not appropriate. Too early has little effect, and too late has no effect, and may even have the opposite effect. Therefore, fertilizer should be applied when the crop needs fertilizer. Topdressing should be moderate and not excessive; special attention should be paid to the dosage when topdressing is applied in the later stages of crop growth. Generally speaking, when the base fertilizer is sufficient, the amount of topdressing can be appropriately reduced; when the base fertilizer is insufficient, the amount of topdressing can be appropriately increased.
    "Applying fertilizer to a large area is not as good as a line." This means that fertilizer should be applied next to the crop so that the fertilizer content is concentrated and the crop can easily absorb and utilize it. Therefore, fertilizer should be applied in a concentrated manner. Ditch application, hole application, dipping seedling roots, and plugging seedling roots are all good methods of concentrated fertilization.
    In short, fertilization should be based on the specific conditions of different fertilizers, soils, crop types, and crop growth conditions, comprehensively consider, adapt to local conditions and times, and flexibly apply. The so-called "look at the land, look at the crops, look at the fertilizer" is the principle that fertilization should follow.

　　肥料和施肥
　　邓锡鎏
    农作物的生长，需要从外界摄取很多的养料。根据科学上的研究，组成植物有机体的元素约有七十种。凡是能供给农作物生长所需要的养料和提高土壤肥力，直接或间接有利于农作物的生长，从而提高了农作物产量和农产品质量的物质，都可以叫做肥料。在施肥上，具有普遍意义的是含有氮、磷、钾和有机物的肥料。
    氮是构成蛋白质的主要部分，蛋白质里含有16％—18％的氮素。蛋白质是植物生命过程的物质基础。所以，没有氮就不会有植物的生命。同时，氮也存在于叶绿素中，氮肥供应充足时，农作物生长茂盛，叶色浓绿。缺乏氮，叶绿素的形成缓慢，叶色发黄，植物体内部养料的制造就会减少，植株矮小，枝叶不茂盛，分蘖少，产量低。但是，氮肥供给过多或施用不当（如施用过迟），会使农作物贪青疯长，茎叶脆弱，容易倒伏，也容易遭受病虫为害，同时也会延迟成熟。
    磷是组成细胞核的主要成分。磷能帮助幼芽和幼根的生长，促进幼苗的发育，还能促进植物体内各种代谢作用，使农作物早开花、早结实。要是磷肥不足，农作物的根部生长不好；茎和叶往往呈现红色、紫色或赤褐色；开花迟，花弱；成熟晚；籽实的发芽力弱；果子长得小、汁少、甜味差；农产品的质量降低。
    钾对于碳水化合物的形成有很密切的关系。钾不足，植物光合作用的强度减弱，淀粉的含量降低。没有钾，植物就不能形成淀粉。钾能使农作物生长健壮，茎叶坚韧，不易倒伏；增强农作物对病害的抵抗力；长的籽实饱满。农作物缺乏钾肥，茎秆长的软弱，容易倒伏；根部发育不良，易患根腐病；叶子尖端和边缘发黄、变褐，最后干枯衰亡；植株矮小；结的籽实也瘦小。
    动物的粪尿、尸体和植物的根、茎、叶等都含有有机物。有机物在土壤里腐烂后，生成一种黑褐色具有胶粘性的东西，叫做腐植质。腐植质能够使土壤微粒粘结起来，形成团粒结构，增加土壤保存水分和养分的能力，提高土壤肥力，是土壤里少不了的东西。通常土壤里所含的有机物不多，而且常消耗减少，需要靠施肥来补充。
    根据各地科学研究和生产实践经验，在目前生产和施肥水平下，我国耕地土壤普遍缺乏有机物和氮素，施用氮肥都能获得增产；磷素在长江流域和其以南地区较为缺乏；钾素一般不缺。因此，在我国施肥问题上，首先要着重增施有机物质和氮肥，其次是磷肥，再次是钾肥。
    我国肥料资源极为丰富，使用的肥料种类很多，粗略估计约有一、二百种。从肥料来源及性质上区别，大致可分为有机肥料和无机肥料两大类。
    有机肥料和它的特点
    有机肥料。　主要的有人粪尿、厩肥、绿肥等。一般说，有机肥料的特点是：（1）含的肥分完全，氮、磷、钾都有，而且还含有有机物，不但能供给农作物养分，同时还具有改良土壤、增进地力的作用。所以，施肥必须以有机肥料为基础。（2）有机肥料需要经过发酵变化，所含的肥分才能供农作物吸收利用，所以肥效一般的比较缓慢，但是肥效较长。
    （一）人粪尿：根据中国农业科学院的研究，一个成年人一年排泄粪尿的数量和所含肥分数量如下表：
　　粪尿
　　人粪
　　人尿
　　合计
　　一个成年人一年排泄量
　　180斤
　　1400斤

　　100斤里含量

　　13两
　　磷酸
    14两
　　1斤12两
　　2斤10两
　　氧化钾
    11两
　　2斤10两
　　3斤5两
    从上表可以看到，人粪尿含氮较多，含磷、钾较少，粪里肥分比尿浓厚；但是从一年的排泄量看，人尿量比人粪数量大得多，总的肥分含量也多得多，所以要特别重视人尿的积攒利用。
    人粪尿的肥效很好，一个成年人一年的粪尿用作肥料，能够增产粮食一百到一百五十斤，籽棉五十到六十斤。
    人粪尿要腐熟才能施用。人粪尿容易腐熟，特别是人尿的腐熟很快，单独的人尿不腐熟也可以施用。腐熟的人粪尿所含的氮肥容易挥发损失，所以在贮存人粪尿的时候，要注意防止肥分的损失。草木灰不要倒在人粪尿里，以免促使人粪尿中氮肥的挥发。
    人粪尿的肥效比较快，适宜用作追肥，也可以用作基肥。一般每亩可以施用一千斤到二千斤，最好是分次施用，一次不要施太多，以免肥分流失。在旱地，施用作基肥时，可以在播种时施于播种沟或穴旁边，施后盖土，然后播种；用作追肥时，可以在植株旁开沟或挖穴施用，施后盖上土。在水田，施用作基肥时，应该在灌水耕耙前，均匀施到耕翻过的干土上，然后灌水耕耙；或者在插秧时，用来蘸秧根或塞秧根。用作追肥时，如果水源方便，最好把田水放掉后施用，施后耙一下，使粪尿与土壤混合，隔一、二天再灌水，让粪尿渗进土里，被土壤充分吸收。在水源困难的地方，也可以不放水施用；但施用后一星期内不要排水，免得肥分流失。
    （二）厩肥：牲畜的粪尿和栏圈里铺垫的褥草或干土的混合物，叫做厩肥。北方农民说的“圈粪”，南方农民说的“栏粪”，都是厩肥。
    牲畜排泄的粪尿数量大，肥分多。比如，一头牛一年排泄的粪尿有二万斤，约含有氮素八十斤左右；一匹马有一万五千斤，约含有氮素九十斤左右；一头猪有四千斤，约含有氮素十五斤左右；一只羊有一千五百斤，约含有氮素十五斤左右；同时，牲畜粪尿还含有磷和钾肥分。牲畜粪中约含有15％——25％的有机物，所以厩肥是供给土壤有机物的重要来源。各地经验，一头猪一年所产的粪尿用作肥料，可以增产粮食二百斤到三百斤。
    马粪、骡粪、驴粪的质地粗松，含的水分少，容易发酵，发热温度高，肥效比较快，所以叫做“热粪”。牛粪的质地细密，含的水分多，发酵较慢，发热温度低，肥效也较迟慢，故叫做“冷粪”。猪粪性质类似牛粪，也属于冷粪，但肥效要比牛粪快。
    厩肥要经过堆沤腐熟才能施用。堆沤厩肥时要封盖好，以免日晒雨淋，损失肥分。厩肥的肥效较慢，但持久耐用，适宜用作基肥。一般每亩可施用二千到四千斤。在整地时，把厩肥运到地里，均匀撒施田面后，随即耕翻入土中，以免肥分散失。厩肥可以施用于各种土壤和作物，特别是施用在粘土地和沙土地里。
    （三）绿肥：凡是利用青绿幼嫩的植物茎叶直接耕翻埋在田地里作肥料的，都叫做“绿肥”。绿肥的来源有两种：一种是天然野生的，另一种是人工栽种的。
    我国栽培的绿肥作物种类很多，约有二、三十种，主要的是冬季绿肥作物，其中又以紫云英、苕子、金花菜等为多。一千斤新鲜的苕子或金花菜茎叶约含有五斤氮素；同时，还含有磷、钾养分，以及大量有机物。所以种植绿肥，不但可以增加肥料，还能改良土壤，提高地力。正如江南的农谚说：“草子种三年，坏田变好田”。根据华东农业科学研究所的调查，一亩水田施用一千五百斤紫云英，可以增产稻谷五十斤左右。
    冬季绿肥作物栽培管理得好，一亩地能产鲜草一万斤以上，可供好几亩田施用。
    绿肥作物要适时耕翻。紫云英和金花菜宜在盛花期耕翻，苕子宜在初花期耕翻，这时候茎叶产量高，含的肥分也多，而且茎叶还不老，容易腐烂。同时，耕翻期要密切结合水稻插秧期，过早、过晚都不好。
    紫云英等绿肥应用作基肥。一般每亩可以施用二千到三千斤。耕翻的时候可施上些石灰，以加速绿肥腐烂，并中和绿肥腐烂过程中所产生的酸性。
    无机肥料和它的特点
    无机肥料。主要的有氮肥、磷肥、钾肥等。一般说，无机肥料特别是化学肥料的特点是：1、肥分浓厚，劲头大；2、肥效快；3、肥分单纯，大多只含有一种或两种肥分；4、不含有机物。因此，无机肥料应该与有机肥料配合施用，不要单独施用。
    （一）氮肥：目前我国使用的无机化学氮肥有以下几种：
　　名称
　　硫酸铵
　　氯化铵
　　硫硝酸铵
　　硝酸铵
　　硝酸铵钙
　　尿素

　　速效，酸性
　　速效，中性
　　速效，碱性
　　稍慢，中性
　　迟效，碱性
    在这些氮肥中，用的最多、最普遍的是硫酸铵。我国施用化学氮肥是普遍有效，而且增产效果显著。一斤硫酸铵一般可以增产粮食三到五斤，籽棉一到二斤。
    硫酸铵和尿素适用于一般的土壤和作物，适用于水田和旱地。硝酸铵和硝酸铵钙所含的氮肥，在水田里容易流失，不宜施用于水稻，施用于旱作物上的效果是很好的。氯化铵不宜施用于烤烟、糖料、薯类等作物及果树，因为它含有氯素，会影响这些农产品的质量。石灰氮最适宜施用于酸性土壤。
    硫酸铵、氯化铵、硫硝酸铵、硝酸铵、硝酸铵钙等都能溶解于水，作物能直接吸收利用，肥效很快；尿素肥效虽稍慢几天，它们都是最宜于用作追肥（要分次少量施），但也可以用作基肥。硫酸铵还可以用来蘸水稻秧根和用作旱地小麦的种肥。
    追肥的施用方法。在旱作地，可以在离作物植株三、四寸远处开沟或挖穴，施入硫酸铵，施后盖土。在水稻田追肥的方法和用人粪尿相仿。
    硝酸铵易结块。结了块的硝酸铵，施用前要轻轻研碎，或用水溶解，不可猛烈捶击，以免发生爆炸危险。硝酸铵存放不当还可能引起燃烧。
    石灰氮所含的氮肥，要经过分解变化，才能供作物吸收利用，肥效较慢；同时，石灰氮在分解过程中会产生有害于作物生长的东西，所以，一般应该施用作基肥，在播种前或插秧前十到十五天施到田地里。石灰氮有毒性，搬运和施用时要预防中毒。
    硫酸铵、硫硝酸铵和氯化铵都是酸性肥料，在酸性土壤施用时，需要施用石灰来中和它们的酸性。但石灰和草木灰不要与它们同时混合施用，以免引起化学变化，损失它们的氮肥。
    （二）磷肥：目前我国使用的无机磷肥有下面几种：
    名称
    过磷酸钙
    重过磷酸钙（又叫三料过磷酸钙）
    熔成磷肥
    汤马斯磷肥
    磷矿粉100斤中含磷酸量（斤）
    18—20
    45—46

    性质
    速效、酸性
    速效、酸性
    迟效、碱性
    迟效、碱性
　　最迟效、碱性
    在这些磷肥中，用的最多的是过磷酸钙，通常一斤过磷酸钙可以增产粮食一斤半到二斤，籽棉半斤到一斤。
    过磷酸钙所含的磷酸能够溶解于水，肥效快，粉状过磷酸钙有一个缺点，这就是当它与土壤中的铁、铝和石灰等物质接触时，它的水溶性磷酸很容易与这些物质化合成磷酸铁、磷酸铝、磷酸三钙等不溶于水的化合物。这样一来，作物就不能吸收利用那些磷酸肥分，过磷酸钙的肥效也就大为降低。因此，粉状过磷酸钙应该与有机肥料（如厩肥、堆肥等）混合后集中使用，或者制成颗粒肥料施用，切忌直接撒施。
    过磷酸钙可以施用在一般的土壤和作物，尤其适宜施用在缺磷的土壤，以及种植大豆、油菜、花生、绿肥等作物的田里。
    过磷酸钙最好用作基肥，也可以用作追肥。施用作基肥：在水田，当插秧时，每亩用五斤左右过磷酸钙与腐熟有机肥料调匀，用来蘸秧根；在旱地，和有机肥料混合后集中施用在播种沟、穴里，先盖土后播种。施用作追肥：水田可以在稻株行间条施，或者塞施在稻株旁边；旱地应在作物植株旁三、四寸远处，开三、四寸深的沟或穴施用。
    重过磷酸钙（又叫三料过磷酸钙）与过磷酸钙性质相同，用法也一样。但是它的肥分更浓厚，要注意用量，并且不要用来蘸秧根。
    汤马斯磷肥、熔成磷肥、磷矿粉都适宜施用于酸性土壤。它们所含的磷酸不溶解于水，施到土壤里，要靠有机酸的作用加以溶解后，才能供作物吸收利用，所以肥效慢，应该与有机肥料堆沤后施用作基肥，不宜作追肥。
    （三）钾肥：我国农家多数都用藁秆、杂草、树枝等作燃料，燃烧后剩下的草木灰，利用作肥料，是农村中重要的钾肥来源。
    通常一百斤草木灰约含有钾肥五斤，磷肥二斤，还含有石灰质。草木灰含的钾肥主要是碳酸钾，它能溶解于水，肥效快，做基肥或追肥都可以。一般土壤和作物都适宜施用，每亩可以施用一百到二百斤。水稻秧田施用草木灰，不但可以供给钾素，而且能起保温作用，减少因低温而引起的烂秧现象。
    草木灰要单存单放，避免风吹雨淋，以免肥分损失。
    施肥应该注意的事情
    有些人认为只要多多施肥，便能增产。这是不正确的。盲目地多施肥料，不但不能丰产，往往会引起减产。
    那么，施肥应该注意些什么事情呢？
    施用肥料，先要知道肥料的性质，是有机肥料，还是无机肥料；是氮肥，还是磷肥，或是钾肥。这些肥料应该配合着使用，互补长短。施用肥料，还要知道肥料含的肥分多少。肥分高的，施用数量要少；肥分低的，施用数量要多。施用肥料，也要知道肥料效力的快慢。肥效迟的要及早施用，肥效快的可以在作物需肥时施用。
    施用肥料，要看土壤情况。一般说，肥地可以少施些，瘦地要多施些。沙土地土粒松散，保肥力弱，养分容易流失，要多施有机肥料；在施用速效性肥料时，要分次，少量施用。粘土地土质紧密，不容易渗水、通气，肥料不易分解，要施用腐熟良好的有机肥料。盐碱地要多施绿肥、厩肥、堆肥，可以减轻碱害，酸性土壤一般缺少磷、钙等养料，应该注意施用磷肥和石灰。
    施用肥料，要看作物种类。作物不同，需要肥料的程度也不一样，有需要氮肥多的，有需要磷肥或钾肥多的。同一类作物，由于品种不同，耐肥能力也有所不同。同一种作物，产量不同，需肥量也不同。例如，生产二百斤的禾谷类粮食约需氮素五点三斤，磷酸二点七斤，氧化钾五点三斤；生产四百斤的禾谷类粮食约需氮素十三点三斤，磷酸五点三斤，氧化钾十二斤。
    肥料要适时施用。追肥过早或过晚都是不适宜的，过早效果不大，过晚起不了作用，甚至会起反作用。所以，肥料要施用在作物需肥的火候上。追肥要适量，不要过多；特别是在作物生育后期施用追肥，更要注意用量。一般说，基肥充足时，追肥用量可以适当少些；基肥不足，追肥可以适当多些。
    “施肥一大片，不如一条线”。这就是说，肥料要施在作物旁边，使肥分集中，作物容易吸收利用。所以，肥料要集中施用。沟施、穴施、蘸秧根、塞秧根等都是集中施肥的好方法。
    总之，施肥要根据不同的肥料、土壤、作物种类和作物生育状况等具体条件，全面考虑，因时因地制宜，灵活运用。所谓“看地、看庄稼、看肥料”，这就是施肥应该遵循的原则。
