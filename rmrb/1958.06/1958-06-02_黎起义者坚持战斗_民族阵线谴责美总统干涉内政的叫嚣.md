Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 1st: According to reports, in Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city, the southern port of Saida, and many other areas in the north and south, the insurgent people continue to fight against the pro-Western government's armed forces. At the same time, the general strike and market shutdown, which have been ongoing for more than twenty days by the insurgent people throughout Lebanon, continue.

The "Voice of Free Lebanon" radio station reported that government forces used artillery in their offensive against the insurgent people in Tripoli, and many women and children in Tripoli were killed.

Damascus newspapers reported that American weapons continue to flow into Lebanon, and military personnel from Iraq and Jordan also continue to enter Lebanon to help the pro-Western government suppress the insurgent people.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Ahmed Halaba, a "consultant" to the National Socialist Party members supporting the Shamun regime in southern Lebanon, has announced his resignation from his "consultant" position. He said that he found that the only purpose of the National Socialist Party members was to serve American imperialism and its agents, and in order to show their loyalty to the American imperialists, they killed the people.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Damascus Radio, the Lebanese National Front issued a statement on May 29, condemning Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on the 28th, which indicated that the United States would interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, and reiterated that the National Front firmly opposes the Eisenhower Doctrine.

The statement expressed serious protest against the interference of the United States and its allies in Lebanon's internal affairs, and pointed out that this interference is "an illegal act and a challenge to the principles of the United Nations."

Lebanese opposition parliamentarian and cousin of the current Prime Minister, Taqi al-Din al-Sulh, said in a statement on the 29th that after we read Eisenhower's speech, "the United States has provided us with new evidence proving that it is against all liberation movements, although it does not admit it."
