    A Great Year

    It has been a year since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The development of China's situation over the past year fully demonstrates its great historical significance.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's work was published at a turning point in China's history. In 1956, China achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. This victory ushered China into a new era in which the exploiting classes would move toward permanent elimination, and social productive forces could develop at an unprecedented rate. China's socialist transformation proceeded exceptionally rapidly, which demonstrated the broad masses' urgent demand for the socialist system. However, the newly established social order would not be consolidated immediately. On the one hand, the basic completion of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production was a major achievement in the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in China, but it was not the end of the struggle between the two roads. The bourgeois elements and some upper-strata petty-bourgeois elements, who were dissatisfied with socialism, had failed on the economic front, but they wanted to continue to compete with the proletariat on the political and ideological fronts. These signs had gradually emerged by the end of 1956 and the beginning of 1957, and correctly handling these contradictions had been placed on the proletariat's agenda. On the other hand, within the ranks of the working people, especially between leaders and the masses, due to the vestiges of the influence of the old era and the imperfections of the new system, there were also many pressing problems that hindered the full development of socialism, which needed to be clarified. The development of certain international events in 1956, especially the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion organized by the Nagy counter-revolutionary clique in late October, further made people feel the necessity of correctly understanding the root causes, nature, and methods of resolving contradictions in socialist society.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's work answered these questions. Based on the principles put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party led the national rectification campaign, which greatly enhanced the consciousness of the proletariat and the working people, thereby greatly accelerating China's social development.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's work affirmed in principle the contradictions in socialist society and distinguished between two types of contradictions with completely different natures—the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people. This argument has significant theoretical and practical significance.

    Any society inevitably has contradictions and inevitably uses contradictions as the driving force for development. This is originally a basic fact of human history and also a basic viewpoint of Marxism. However, for a period of time, some people used to shy away from the contradictions in socialist society, and even denied the existence of such contradictions. In this way, these people had to fall into passivity and confusion in the face of facts. Of course, those who oppose socialism attempt to use the contradictions in socialist society to negate the superiority of socialism and negate the fundamental unity of the masses in socialist society. However, in order to refute their slander, it is not necessary to deny the contradictions in socialist society. The question is to conduct a scientific analysis of the contradictions, so that the vanguard of the proletariat can actively and correctly resolve these contradictions according to the objective laws of the contradictions, and constantly push society forward. The series of major developments in our country over the past year have been the result of talking extensively about the contradictions in socialist society; facts show that this has not hindered us, but has ensured that we advance at the highest speed.

    Distinguishing the contradictions in socialist society into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people has first of all dealt a fatal blow to all kinds of anti-socialist elements and revisionist elements. These people attempt to deliberately distort the contradictions among the people in socialist society into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and use the shortcomings and mistakes of the Communist Party and the People's Government to incite the people to "revolt." The Nagy elements in Hungary, the revisionist elements in Yugoslavia, and the bourgeois right-wing elements in China did just that. At the same time, they describe the real contradictions between ourselves and the enemy (including the contradictions between themselves and the people, which are of an antagonistic nature) as contradictions among the people. These methods of theirs have once deceived a portion of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong's work pointed out the fundamental differences between the two, put forward six political criteria as the boundary between the two, and pointed out the different class roots of revisionism and dogmatism, which gave the Chinese people a powerful weapon in the anti-rightist struggle.

    But the significance of distinguishing between the two types of contradictions is far more than this. Strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions also puts those who have bureaucratic tendencies, are detached from the masses and are high above them, and who abuse coercive methods against the people without relying on methods of persuasion, in a position where they have to correct their mistakes, thereby greatly strengthening the connection between the proletariat's vanguard and the people. In our socialist country, some management workers are influenced by the bourgeois ideology and style of work, and there is a gap between them and the people, and they even use methods of handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to handle contradictions among the people. This dangerous tendency must be corrected, and the experience of the rectification movement has proved that for the vast majority of workers, this tendency can be completely corrected. The vast majority of workers accepted the criticisms and suggestions of the masses in the rectification movement, overcame the shortcomings in their work, and took a series of steps to get rid of official airs, go deep among the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and proceed from the interests of the masses in everything. In this way, they gained full initiative in their work. They became students of the masses, and therefore they can be teachers of the masses; they serve the masses, and therefore they can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Under such circumstances, the political outlook of our country has undergone tremendous changes; as a result, the economic outlook of our country has also undergone tremendous changes.

    From this it can be seen how immeasurable the role of correctly understanding the contradictions in socialist society, correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, and correctly handling the contradictions among the people has played in China's anti-rightist struggle, rectification movement, and the great leap forward in socialist construction over the past year. It can be said that without these principles put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country could not have mustered their energy, strived for the upstream, and built socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, the Party Central Committee is completely correct in regarding the correct handling of contradictions among the people as an inseparable part of the general line of socialist construction.

    Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly pointed out that correctly handling contradictions among the people is not a new issue for Marxism, nor is it a new issue for our Party. Correctly handling contradictions among the people is also the working method of the Party's mass line. Why does it seem like a new issue to many comrades? This is because, after the basic end of the large-scale, rapid and violent mass class struggle in the revolutionary period, more attention has been paid to the contradictions among the people, and at this time, some comrades have forgotten the lessons of history and mistakenly believe that in the cause of socialist construction, they can not rely on the masses, can not rely on politics, and can only rely on the administrative order method of a few people. The fallacy of this thinking has been fully exposed in the history of China's rapid development over the past year. But this does not mean that after the lessons of the past year, the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people has been fully grasped by the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and from now on everything will be fine. The facts are by no means so. The ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will not be so easy to sweep away, and the ideological tendencies of subjectivism and metaphysics will not be so easy to overcome. The task of our Party, the task of all Marxists in our country, is to continue to fight for the propaganda of the idea of ​​correctly handling contradictions among the people on the basis of the victories that have been achieved, and to continue to fight for the consolidation of the results of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement. Only in this way can our newly established socialist system become increasingly consolidated, and our great socialist construction cause can leap forward again and again on the basis of relying on the masses!

专栏：

    伟大的一年
    毛泽东同志的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的著作发表一周年了。一年来我国形势的发展，充分证明了它的伟大的历史意义。
    毛泽东同志的著作是发表在我国历史的转折时期。1956年，我国取得了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的决定性胜利，这个胜利使我国进入了一个剥削阶级走向永远消灭、社会生产力可以空前迅速发展的新时代。我国的社会主义改造进行得异常迅速，这说明了广大群众对于社会主义制度的迫切要求。但是新建立的社会秩序是不会马上巩固起来的。在一方面，生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的基本完成，是我国社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的重大成果，但是并不是两条道路斗争的结束。对于社会主义心怀不满的资产阶级分子以及某些上层小资产阶级分子，在经济战线上失败了，但是还要在政治战线思想战线上继续同无产阶级较量较量。这种迹象到1956年底1957年初已经逐步显露，而正确地对待这种矛盾已经提到无产阶级的议事日程上来了。在另一方面，在劳动人民内部，首先是在领导者同群众之间，由于旧时代的影响的遗留，由于新制度的还不完善，也存在着许多妨碍社会主义充分发挥威力的迫切问题，需要加以澄清。1956年某些国际事件的发展，特别是10月下旬的由纳吉反革命集团所组织的匈牙利反革命叛乱，更加使人们觉得有正确认识社会主义社会中的矛盾的根源、性质和解决方法的必要。
    毛泽东同志的著作答复了这些问题。根据毛泽东同志所提出的原理，党领导了全国人民的整风运动，这个运动大大提高了无产阶级和劳动人民的觉悟，从而大大加速了我国的社会发展。
    毛泽东同志的著作从原则上肯定了社会主义社会中的矛盾，并且区别了两类性质完全不同的矛盾——敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这个论断具有重大的理论意义和实践意义。
    任何社会都必然有矛盾，都必然以矛盾为发展的动力，这本来是人类历史的基本事实，也是马克思主义的基本观点。但是有一个时期，有些人曾经讳言社会主义社会中的矛盾，甚至否认这种矛盾的存在。这样，这些人就不得不在事实面前陷于被动和混乱。当然，反对社会主义的人企图用社会主义社会中的矛盾来否定社会主义的优越性，否定人民群众在社会主义社会中的根本上的团结一致。但是为了驳斥他们的诽谤，并不需要否认社会主义社会中的矛盾。问题是在对于矛盾加以科学的分析，使无产阶级的先锋队得以根据矛盾的客观规律积极地正确地解决这些矛盾，不断地把社会推向前进。我们国家一年来的一系列的重大发展，正是把社会主义社会中的矛盾大谈特谈的结果；事实表明这并没有阻碍了我们，反而保证了我们以最高的速度前进。
    把社会主义社会中的矛盾区别为敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，这首先就给了形形色色的反社会主义分子和修正主义分子一个致命的打击。这些人企图把社会主义社会中的人民内部的矛盾故意歪曲成为敌我之间的矛盾，利用共产党和人民政府的缺点和错误煽动人民起来“革命”。匈牙利的纳吉分子、南斯拉夫的修正主义分子和我国的资产阶级右派分子就是这样作的。同时，他们又把真正的敌我矛盾（包括他们自己同人民之间的敌我性质的矛盾）说成为人民内部的矛盾。他们的这些手法都曾经欺骗过一部分群众。毛泽东同志的著作指出了两者的根本区别，提出了六项政治标准作为两者的界限，并且指明了修正主义和教条主义的不同的阶级根源，这就使我国人民的反右派斗争得到了有力的武器。
    但是区别两类矛盾的意义远不限于这一点。严格区别两类矛盾，还使那些有官僚主义倾向的、脱离群众高高在上的、对人民群众滥用强制方法而不依靠说服方法的人们处于非改正错误不可的地位，从而使无产阶级先锋队同人民群众的联系大大地加强了起来。在我们的社会主义国家中，一部分管理工作人员受资产阶级思想作风的熏染，同人民群众之间存在着隔阂，甚至用处理敌我矛盾的方法来处理人民内部矛盾。这种危险的倾向是必须纠正的，而整风运动的经验证明，对于绝大多数的工作人员说来，这种倾向也是完全能够纠正的。绝大多数的工作人员在整风运动中接受了群众的批评建议，克服了工作中的缺点，并且采取了一系列的步骤打掉官气，深入群众，跟群众同甘共苦，一切从群众的利益出发。这样，他们在工作中就获得了充分的主动。他们作了群众的学生，因而就能作群众的先生；他们为群众服务，因而就能充分调动群众的积极性创造性。在这样的情况下，我们国家的政治面貌发生了极大的变化；随之而来的是，我们国家的经济面貌也发生了极大的变化。
    由此可见，正确地认识社会主义社会中的矛盾，正确地区别两类矛盾，正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，这些原则，对于我国一年来的反右派斗争、整风运动和社会主义建设的大跃进，起了怎样难以估量的作用。完全可以说，离开了毛泽东同志所提出的这些原则，全国人民就不可能鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。因此，党中央把正确处理人民内部矛盾作为社会主义建设总路线的一个不可分的组成部分，这是完全正确的。
    毛泽东同志曾经反复指出：正确处理人民内部矛盾，这对于马克思主义并不是一个新问题，对于我们党并不是一个新问题。正确处理人民内部矛盾，也就是党的群众路线的工作方法。为什么对于许多同志好像是一个新问题呢？这是因为，在革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本结束以后，人民内部矛盾更多地被人们注意了，而正在这个时候，却又有一部分同志忘记了历史的教训，错误地以为在社会主义建设事业中可以不依靠群众，可以不依靠政治，可以只依靠少数人的行政命令方法去进行的原故。这种思想的错误在过去一年我国的飞速发展的历史中已经暴露无余了。但是这决不是说，经过了过去一年的教训，正确处理人民内部矛盾的原理，就已经被全党和全国人民所充分掌握，从此可以万事大吉了。事实决不是如此。资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想影响不会这样容易扫清，主观主义和形而上学的思想倾向不会这样容易克服。我们党的任务，我国一切马克思主义者的任务，就是在已经得到的胜利的基础上，继续为宣传正确处理人民内部矛盾的思想而斗争，继续为巩固反右派斗争和整风运动的成果而斗争。只有这样，我们的新建立的社会主义制度才能日趋巩固，我们的伟大的社会主义建设事业才能在依靠群众的基础上跃进再跃进！
