The Ministry of Communications recently held symposiums on local transportation work in the South and North in Wuhan and Beijing, respectively. Based on the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the meetings summarized the basic experiences of eight years of work, determined the goals of the technological revolution, drafted plans for future leaps forward, and put forward the resounding slogan of "the whole Party and all the people should run transportation." These two meetings greatly inspired transportation workers and all relevant personnel across the country to strive to build a comprehensive national transportation network based on modern tools in the shortest possible time.

Under the situation of the rapid development of local industry and the booming agricultural production, all aspects of the national economy have a more pressing demand for transportation. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production comes a large increase in transportation tasks. In the past, the growth was a few percent, now it is a doubling or several-fold increase. This prompts the transportation sector to catch up quickly, otherwise it will hinder the further great development of industrial and agricultural production.

In the past, transportation work had achievements. Both in terms of highways and waterways, it basically met the needs of production and construction. However, in the past work, a fundamental issue of the transportation industry, namely the issue of two methods and two guiding ideologies, has not been completely resolved; now, this fundamental issue has been basically resolved ideologically. With the liberation of thought, the development of the transportation industry can be greatly promoted.

What are the two methods and two guiding ideologies for building the transportation industry? One is to one-sidedly emphasize vertical leadership, administrative management, rules and regulations, and not seriously rely on Party committees and governments at all levels, especially the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, to achieve the policy of the whole Party running transportation; it one-sidedly emphasizes specialization, standardization, and technicality, and only expects state investment, without seriously relying on the broad masses and relying on the whole people to run transportation; it one-sidedly emphasizes high standards and modernization, limiting the transportation industry to only a few points and lines, instead of facing mountainous areas, rural areas, factories, mines, and remote areas to popularize transportation. Using this method and guiding ideology, the development of the transportation industry will inevitably be restricted, and the result will not be greater, faster, better, and more economical, but less, slower, worse, and more expensive.

The other method and guiding ideology is that the whole Party and all the people run transportation, specifically: relying on the localities, relying on Party committees at all levels; relying on the broad masses, following the mass line, emphasizing serving the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives; facing mountainous areas, rural areas, factories, mines, and remote areas to popularize transportation, advocating the combination of popularization and improvement, with popularization as the main focus. Building transportation with this as the guiding ideology will not result in less, slower, worse, and more expensive, but greater, faster, better, and more economical.

Experience has proved that it is correct to build the transportation industry in accordance with the latter policy, because this policy reflects the objective needs of China's industrial and agricultural production development and the broad masses of people for transportation, reflects the correct relationship between transportation and various departments of the national economy, which is the policy of the whole Party and all the people running transportation.

The experience of the whole Party and all the people running transportation has emerged in large quantities throughout the country. Wangying District in Lichuan County, Hubei Province, relying on the whole Party and all the people to run transportation, spent only four months developing 4,200 vehicles and 30 wooden boats, building 2,500 sky rails (aerial ropeways), 156 chutes, and a 1,200-kilometer district-wide road network, thereby quickly realizing the transportation plan of "changing small roads into large roads, changing manual transport into animal power transport, and changing carrying on shoulders into vehicles and boats," and solving the urgently needed field transportation problems at that time. Yulin Prefecture in Shaanxi Province relied on the whole Party and all the people to build highways, which enabled the traditionally barren mountainous areas to develop agricultural production. The Dongfanghong Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, relying on the efforts of the entire cooperative to implement the policy of democratic and thrifty management, used its own accumulation to develop motorized ships, and will quickly realize the mechanization of the entire cooperative within a year. These vivid examples illustrate that the policy of the whole Party and all the people running transportation is completely correct. The transportation industry must follow this correct path.

With the correct path for building transportation, it is also necessary to implement technological revolution in response to current and future tasks, popularize transportation construction, and rapidly improve transportation capacity to meet the needs of the development of the situation.

The goal of the technological revolution in the transportation industry is first and foremost to reform transportation tools, replacing carrying on shoulders and backs with vehicles and boats, liberating a large amount of labor in rural areas, especially mountainous areas; and gradually innovating existing folk vehicles and boats. While adopting new technologies as much and as quickly as possible, it is necessary to make full use of existing equipment and widely carry out mass movements for improving tools and technological innovations. Implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, gradually improving on the basis of popularization, combining modern new technologies with general technologies, and combining mechanization and semi-mechanization with manual labor. In conjunction with agricultural production, pay attention to promoting the comprehensive utilization of irrigation and drainage machinery, hydropower generation, and transportation.

While implementing the technological revolution, it is necessary to reform business management accordingly, breaking down outdated rules and regulations in order to liberate the productive forces that have been constrained.

Implementing the technological revolution will open up broad prospects for the transportation industry. The Second National Congress of the Eighth Party Congress has issued a fighting slogan for the transportation industry, which is to establish a comprehensive transportation network based on modern tools throughout the country. Through the path of technological revolution, the scale of this long-term development will be realized in a relatively short period of time. In the future development of the transportation industry, we must, in accordance with the policy of comprehensive utilization of water resources, open up canals and develop waterway transportation. Adopt economic ship types and accelerate port mechanization, facilitate direct transportation between rivers and seas, strengthen intermodal transportation, actively develop waterway transportation in all places where conditions permit, vigorously develop highway transportation, and, while planning industrial and agricultural production, make road network plans for provinces (cities), prefectures, counties, townships, and communes, and adopt the methods of public-private partnership, dividing areas and sections, the masses building roads, the masses maintaining roads, and the masses greening, to realize a national local road network.

Now, we are in a great era of historical leapfrog development. The general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is guiding the rapid development of the transportation industry. Party committees in various localities have begun to grasp transportation work, and the broad masses are supporting transportation construction with great strength. The new situation of the whole Party and all the people running transportation has promoted the development of the transportation industry, and a new upsurge in transportation construction is taking shape. Transportation departments at all levels must use this favorable situation, plant red flags, uproot white flags, give prominence to politics, and plant the red flag of the general line of socialist construction in every corner. We must uniformly arrange the comprehensive cooperation between transportation construction and various departments of the national economy, give full play to the local human, financial, and material resources, and set off a new upsurge in transportation construction throughout the country, so as to powerfully adapt to and promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production!

    全党全民办交通
    交通部在最近期间，分别在武汉和北京召开了南方的和北方的地方交通工作座谈会。根据党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，总结了八年工作的基本经验，确定了技术革命的目标，拟出了今后跃进的规划，并提出了“全党全民办交通”的响亮口号。这两次会议，大大地鼓舞了全国交通运输职工和一切有关人员，力争在尽可能短的时间内建成一个以现代工具为主的、四通八达的全国运输网。
    在地方工业一日千里、农业生产万马奔腾的形势下，国民经济的各方面对交通运输的要求更加迫切了。随着工农业生产大跃进而俱来的，是大量运输任务的增加。过去是百分之几的增长，现在是一倍或几倍的上升。这就促使了交通运输必须迅速跟上，否则就会妨碍工农业生产的进一步的大发展。
    过去交通运输工作是有成绩的。不论公路和水运方面，基本上适应了生产和建设上的需要。但是，在过去的工作中，还没有完全解决的交通运输事业的一个根本问题，即两种方法、两种指导思想的问题；现在，这个根本问题已经从思想上基本解决了。思想解放了，就能大大促进交通运输事业的发展。
    建设交通运输事业的两种方法和两种指导思想是什么呢？一种是片面地强调垂直领导、行政管理、规章制度，而不认真依靠各级党委和政府、特别是依靠各级党委的统一领导，以实现全党办交通的方针；它片面强调专业化、正规化和技术性，单纯指望国家投资，而不认真依靠广大群众、依靠全民办交通；它片面强调高标准、近代化，把交通运输事业只局限在少数点线上，而不面向山区、农村、厂矿和偏僻地区去普及交通。用这种方法和指导思想，交通运输事业的发展必然受到限制，其结果不是多快好省，而是少慢差费。
    另一种方法和指导思想是全党全民办交通，具体的说就是：依靠地方、依靠各级党委；依靠广大群众，走群众路线，强调为工农业生产和人民生活需要而服务；面向山区、农村、厂矿和偏僻地区去普及交通，主张普及和提高相结合，并以普及为主。以此为指导思想建设交通，其结果不是少慢差费，而是多快好省。
    经验证明，按照后一种方针建设交通运输事业是正确的，因为这一方针反映了我国工业、农业生产发展和广大人民对交通运输的客观需要，反映了交通运输跟国民经济各部门之间的正确关系，就是全党全民办交通的方针。
    全党全民办交通的经验已经在全国各地大量出现。湖北省利川县汪营区依靠全党全民办交通，只用四个月时间就发展了四千二百辆车子、三十艘木船，建设起二千五百条天线（架空索道）、一百五十六条滑道、一千二百多公里的全区道路网，从而迅速实现了“改小路为大路、改人力运输为畜力运输、改肩挑为车船”的交通规划，解决了当时迫切需要解决的田间运输问题。陕西省榆林专区，依靠全党全民修建公路，使一向贫瘠的山区发展了农业生产。湖北省黄梅县东方红木帆船运输合作社，依靠全社努力贯彻民主办社、勤俭办社的方针，以自己的积累发展机动船舶，一年之内将迅速实现全社机械化。这些生动的事例说明了全党全民办交通的方针是完全正确的。交通运输事业必须走这条正确的路线。
    有了正确的路线建设交通，还必须针对当前的和今后的任务实行技术革命，普及交通建设，迅速提高运输能力，以适应形势发展的需要。
    交通运输业的技术革命目标，首先是改革运输工具，以车船代替肩挑人背，解放农村特别是山区的大量劳动力；对现有的民间车船逐步革新。在尽多尽快地采用新技术的同时，必须充分利用现有设备，广泛地展开群众性的改良工具和技术革新运动。实行普及和提高相结合、在普及基础上逐步提高、现代化新技术与一般技术相结合、机械化及半机械化与手工劳动相结合的方针。结合农业生产，注意推行排灌机械、水利发电与交通运输的综合利用。
    在实行技术革命的同时，必须相应地改革经营管理，破除陈旧的规章制度，以解放被束缚的生产力。
    实行技术革命，将为交通运输事业开辟广阔的前途。党的八届二次代表大会已为交通运输事业发出了战斗的口号，这就是要在全国范围内，建立一个以现代工具为主的、四通八达的运输网。通过技术革命的道路，这个远景发展的规模，将在较短的时期内获得实现。在今后交通事业的发展过程中，我们必须根据水利资源综合利用的方针，开辟运河发展水路运输。采用经济船型，并加速港口机械化，畅通江海直达运输，加强水陆联运，在一切有条件的地方积极发展水路运输，大力发展公路运输，并在规划工农业生产的同时，做出省（市）、专、县、乡、社的道路网规划，采取民办公助、分区分段、群众修路、群众养路、群众绿化的办法，实现全国地方道路网。
    现在，我们正处在历史上伟大的飞跃发展时代。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，引导着交通运输事业迅速向前发展。各地党委已经开始抓交通运输工作，广大群众正以巨大的力量支持交通建设。全党全民办交通的新形势，已经促进了交通运输业的发展，一个交通建设的新高潮正在形成。各级交通运输部门必须运用这一有利形势，插红旗，拔白旗，政治挂帅，把社会主义建设总路线的红旗，插到各个角落。必须统一安排交通建设和国民经济各部门之间的全面协作，充分发挥地方的人力、财力、物力，在全国范围内掀起一个交通运输建设的新高潮，有力地适应和促进工农业生产的大跃进！
