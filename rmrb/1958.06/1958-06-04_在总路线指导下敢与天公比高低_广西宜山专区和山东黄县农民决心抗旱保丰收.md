　　Under the Guidance of the General Line, Daring to Compete with the Heavens
    Yishan Prefecture, Guangxi, and Huang County, Shandong, Farmers Resolve to Fight Drought and Ensure a Good Harvest
    (Our Report) Encouraged by the General Line, the broad masses of farmers in Yishan Prefecture, Guangxi, are now competing with the heavens, with even greater determination to fight drought and ensure a good harvest.

    Recently, Yishan Prefecture vigorously promoted the General Line for building socialism and conducted work inspections and debates in conjunction with this. This enabled cadres and the masses who were pessimistic and disappointed in the face of the severe drought to find ways to overcome difficulties and reinvigorate themselves to work hard.

    In Xincheng County, which has been fighting drought for more than sixty days, not only is there a shortage of water for irrigating fields, but nearly half of the cooperatives are also experiencing difficulties in obtaining drinking water. Some cadres and masses believed that a reduction in production this year was a foregone conclusion. However, after the General Line was promoted, they were invigorated. More than 9,000 people in the county newly invested in the fight against drought. They built twelve dams across the three river sources where water was available, found more than 400 underground water sources, and solved the irrigation problem for 55,000 mu of land. They were full of energy and strived to move forward, converting fields that had not been planted with early rice to medium rice, planting more tuber crops, and vigorously promoting advanced production technologies. In this way, they not only made up for the losses caused by drought-reduced production but also increased grain production compared to the original plan.

    (Our Report) Inspired and encouraged by the Party's General Line, the people of Huang County, Shandong Province, are using their power to turn the tide, overcome the drought, seize an all-around bumper harvest, and ensure the realization of the "Thousand Catty County."

    Huang County has not had a thorough rain for 330 days, from July of last year to the present, and the drought is seriously threatening the soon-to-be-harvested wheat and the spring seedlings that have already emerged from the soil.

    On the evening of May 27th, more than 100,000 people in the county listened to the county party committee's broadcast report conveying and mobilizing the implementation of the General Line. Immediately, everyone was energized, and the entire county was in a fervor. After the broadcast meeting, all townships and communes immediately launched debates, unanimously expressing that under the glorious light of the General Line, they were fully confident and capable of overcoming the drought and seizing an all-around bumper harvest. The slogans they put forward were: "Thousand Catty County encounters a major drought, drought resistance is the lifeline; everyone works hard, day and night, resolutely seize the Thousand Catty County." All townships and communes immediately established drought-resistance combat headquarters; production teams became shock brigades to overcome the drought. The broad masses of commune members were even more energetic, striving to put out the drought within three or four days. Under the slogan "If the sky doesn't rain, don't rely on the sky, move big and small jars up the mountain," Tianjia Township has moved more than 2,000 water jars to the mountains. Each day, more than 1,300 people from various units directly under the county government support the farmers from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.

    After several days of hard work, the county has now irrigated more than 270,000 mu of wheat with grain-filling water. In another four or five days, 400,000 mu of wheat can be universally irrigated twice, and continuous irrigation can be achieved to ensure a good wheat harvest. At the same time, drought-resistant sowing and watering to protect seedlings have also achieved a decisive victory.

　　在总路线指导下敢与天公比高低
    广西宜山专区和山东黄县农民决心抗旱保丰收
    本报讯  在总路线的鼓舞下，广西宜山专区的广大农民正与天公比高低，抗旱保丰收的劲儿更足。
    最近，宜山专区大张旗鼓地宣传了建设社会主义的总路线，并结合进行了工作检查，开展了辩论，使在严重干旱面前悲观失望的干部和群众找到了战胜困难的办法，重整旗鼓地大干起来。
    已经抗旱六十多天的忻城县，不仅灌田缺水，将近一半的合作社吃水也发生了困难。有些干部和群众认为今年减产已成定局。可是在宣传了总路线以后，他们振作起来，全县新投入抗旱斗争的九千多人，在有水的三条河源上拦河筑坝十二处，找到地下水源四百多处，解决了五万五千亩田的灌溉问题。他们鼓足干劲，力争上游，把没有插上早稻的田改种中稻，多种薯类作物，并大力推广先进生产技术。这样，不仅弥补了受旱减产的损失，还可比原计划增产粮食。

    本报讯  在党的总路线的启示和鼓舞下，山东省黄县人民正以回天之力，压倒干旱，夺取全面丰收，保证实现千斤县。
    黄县从去年7月到现在三百三十天未下透雨，干旱严重地威胁着即将丰收的小麦和已出土的春苗。
    5月27日晚全县十几万群众收听了县委传达和动员贯彻总路线的广播报告，顿时人人振奋，全县沸腾。各乡各社都在广播大会后当场展开了辩论，一致表示在总路线的光辉照耀下，完全有信心有力量战胜干旱，夺取全面丰收。他们提出的口号是：“千斤县遇大旱、抗旱就是生命线；人人拼，日夜干，坚决夺得千斤县”。各乡社立即成立了抗旱战斗指挥部；生产队变成了压倒干旱突击队。广大社员更是干劲冲天，争取三、四天内扑灭干旱。田家乡在“天不下雨不靠天，大缸小缸搬上山”的口号下，搬到山上的水缸已达二千多个。县直属机关各单位，每天都有一千三百余人从晚上七点到十一点，支援农民兄弟。
    经过几天的奋战，现全县已浇小麦灌浆水二十七万多亩，再有四、五天四十万亩小麦可普遍浇完两遍水，并且能做到连续浇、浇得透，确保小麦丰收。同时，抗旱播种、浇水保苗也已取得决定性的胜利。
