What Kind of Production Should We Engage In?
    Yang Xuan
    Luo Xiaomei has been worried lately because she can't find a way to engage in production. It turns out that after the rectification campaign among residents of our neighborhood, our area called on residents to engage in production. This was originally what most residents wanted, so everyone was thrilled and actively connected with factories and handicraft cooperatives, taking on some processing work to do. However, there wasn't that much processing work available, and some of it was seasonal, and we are currently in the off-season. Luo Xiaomei and some other residents suddenly had no work to do.
    Comrade Yang has also been worried lately because he can't find a place to iron clothes. He said that many Shanghai alleys have stalls specifically for ironing clothes, which is very convenient, but there are none here. Here, if you want ironing, you have to bring washing, they don't just do ironing. But he and many comrades in his office wash their own clothes and only need ironing. He said that clothes can certainly be worn without ironing after washing, but summer outerwear lasts longer if ironed, it's not just for aesthetics. He also said that they also have requests for darning socks and mending clothes, but they haven't found a place that does this kind of work.
    Luo Xiaomei and Comrade Yang are both my neighbors. When I put the two situations together, wow, on the one hand, people want to work but can't find work, and on the other hand, there's work to be done but no one to do it, isn't that a perfect match? I excitedly ran around and told both sides. Comrade Yang was naturally delighted and had no other opinions, only saying that if residents could set up more of these service industries, it would benefit both people and themselves. But Luo Xiaomei wasn't happy, she said, "Ironing and darning, what kind of future is there in that? Isn't that what we do enough of at home already, why would we go and do it for others? Now that we are being called on to engage in production, we should at least do some processing work for factories and handicraft cooperatives to look respectable."
    Look how wrong Luo Xiaomei's thinking is! She divides labor in various industries into high and low, viewing them as having different ranks. Now people already know that various types of labor that serve the people only have different divisions of labor, and there is no distinction between high and low. Ironing, washing, and mending are needed by society, so it's worth doing, what's shameful or undignified about it? Only people in the old society or those with remnants of old thinking see it as serving others. Moreover, it's possible and appropriate for residents to do this kind of work, it doesn't require a lot of equipment or space, and it can be done at home or organized to be done collectively.
    I think we can't just blame Luo Xiaomei, the cadres in our area are also at fault. While calling on residents to engage in production, they should clarify this thinking and propose principles and methods suitable to local conditions and times.

    搞些什么生产？
    杨萱
    罗小妹近来发了愁，为的是找不到生产门路。原来街道居民整风过后，我们这地区就号召居民搞生产。这原是大多数居民所要求的，所以大家兴高彩烈，纷纷同工厂、手工业社挂了钩，领了些加工活儿来干。但是加工活儿没那末多，而且有些活儿还有季节性，现时正处在淡季。罗小妹和一些居民一时就没了活儿干。
    杨同志近来也发愁，为的是找不到一个熨烫衣服的所在。他说上海许多里弄口都设有专门熨烫衣服的摊子，方便得很，这里就没有，这里是要熨烫就得带洗，不单独给熨烫。但是他和机关里好多同志都自己洗衣，只要求熨烫。他说衣服洗了不熨固然一样穿，但是夏天的外衣熨一下就耐穿，不单是求美观。他还说他们还有补袜补衣的要求，可也没有找到有做这一类工作的地方。
    罗小妹、杨同志都是我的邻居。我把两方面的情况一核计，着哇，一方面是想干活而找不到活干，一方面是有活而找不到人干，这不就对上口径了吗？我兴冲冲地跑来跑去跟两方面一说。杨同志自是满心欢喜，别无意见，只说居民们如果多多办些这类服务性行业，对人对己都有利。只是罗小妹不乐意，她说：“熨烫、补袜，这有什么出息？这种事儿在家里做得还嫌不够还是怎么的，还去给人家做？如今号召搞生产，至少也得弄些厂里、手工业社里的加工活儿干干，才像个样儿。”
    瞧，罗小妹的思想多不对头！她是把各行各业的劳动分了高下，看成是有等级的了。现在人们都已知道，为人民服务的各种劳动，只有分工的不同，没有高低贵贱的分别。烫洗、缝补这些工作，社会上需要，就值得做，有什么不光彩不体面的？只有旧社会的人或是有旧思想残余的人，才把这看做是伺候人。况且居民做这种工作有可能，也合适，用不着许多设备和地方，既可以拿回家去做，也可以组织起来做。
    我想，也不能单怪罗小妹不是，我们地区的干部也有不是。他们在号召居民搞生产的同时，应该明确这种思想，提出因地因时制宜的道理和办法来才好。
