Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 5th. Bulgarian Minister of Council Chairman Yugov reported on the 5th at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party that Bulgaria's current task is: on the one hand, to consolidate, improve, and develop socialist relations of production, and on the other hand, to rely on increasingly strengthened socialist relations of production to continue to develop productive forces and increase production.

Yugov said in a report on instructions for the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of Bulgaria from 1958 to 1962: The tremendous achievements that our country has made in implementing the Second Five-Year Plan have laid a broad and solid foundation for our country to further build a socialist society. These achievements have fundamentally changed the face of our country. He emphasized that socialist relations of production have completely occupied a dominant position in our country. At present, the socialist component in the national economy accounts for 98% of the total industrial output value, more than 90% of the total agricultural output value, and more than 99% of retail trade. Yugov then said that due to the successful completion of the tasks of Bulgaria's Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), and due to the profound changes in the country's economic and social class structure, the new social system of socialism has won in Bulgaria, completing the transition from capitalist relations of production to socialism.

He said, however, it must be taken into account that, due to the extreme backwardness of the national economy inherited from capitalism, only a small portion of the residents are temporarily engaged in industry, and the development of industrial raw material bases is still insufficient. The level of development of productive forces is not yet sufficient to conclude that the construction of our socialist society has been completed.

When talking about the basic direction of economic development during the Third Five-Year Plan period, Yugov said that the draft instructions for the Third Five-Year Plan stipulate that by 1962, the total industrial output value should increase by at least 60% compared with 1957. At that time, the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture will be approximately seventy to thirty. He said that this means that Bulgaria will increasingly become an advanced industrial-agricultural socialist country.

The most important tasks in agriculture during the Third Five-Year Plan period are: to use land and machinery in the most rational way, to ensure stable and bumper harvests, to achieve a high productivity of animal husbandry, and to resolutely reduce the production cost of per unit product.

The draft instructions stipulate that the total agricultural output value in 1962 will increase by about 35% compared with 1957. The socialist component in agriculture will account for more than 97% in terms of crop output and about 96% in terms of animal husbandry output.

Yugov pointed out that if the second sector of agriculture—animal husbandry, especially public animal husbandry—is not extensively developed, then the tasks related to developing agriculture and correctly coordinating the various sectors of agriculture cannot be reasonably resolved. In order to solve this task, it is stipulated that the number of livestock will be greatly increased during the Five-Year Plan period, and the breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. will be improved.

The draft instructions stipulate that the investment amount during the Third Five-Year Plan period is about 26.735 billion leva (Bulgarian currency), while the Second Five-Year Plan stipulated 20.065 billion leva (calculated at 1956 prices).

Yugov pointed out that further improving the labor productivity of various sectors of the national economy will create a realistic possibility for the implementation of a six or seven-hour workday.

Yugov then pointed out that the Third Five-Year Plan stipulates the implementation of many measures to further improve the material welfare of the working people, develop science, education, and art, and further improve the people's cultural level. The actual income of urban and rural working people in 1962 will increase by 30% compared with 1957. National income will increase by approximately 50% during this period. Schools will ensure a gradual transition to comprehensive technical education.

Yugov emphasized that the Party and the government consistently implement the policy of strengthening unity, friendship, and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Due to the implementation of this policy, Bulgaria has been able to achieve brilliant achievements in a short period.

Yugov said that the Bulgarian Communists angrily refuted the slander of the drafters of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia who insisted that the Soviet Union wanted to obtain "hegemony" and "exploit" other socialist countries. The sole motive of the Soviet Union in helping our country and other socialist countries is to prosper the economy and culture of these countries and to strengthen and develop the socialist world system. There can only be such a motive and no other motive, because our people are inspired by the same thought—the thought of Marxism-Leninism—and we have the same goal—the victory of socialism, the victory of communism.

Yugov said, can the fraternal and selfless assistance that our country has obtained from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries be equated with the "assistance" that imperialist countries give to smaller capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries? No, this kind of equation cannot be drawn! Therefore, we Bulgarian Communists resolutely condemn the attempt of the Yugoslav leaders to confuse the relationship between the Soviet Union and us or any friendly country with the relationship between imperialist countries and other underdeveloped countries. It is very strange that the Yugoslav leaders are widely spreading a myth, saying that the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia is carrying out equal cooperation with the United States, and that the assistance obtained from the United States is in the interests of the Yugoslav people. Look, when you roll into the revisionist quagmire, how far you will degenerate! Yugov then listed facts to illustrate the achievements of Bulgaria's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He said that according to preliminary statistics, in the past five years, trade with socialist countries accounted for 80% of Bulgaria's total import and export trade.

Yugov pointed out at the end of his report that the instructions on the Third Five-Year Plan submitted to the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party for approval are a great program for the further development of socialism in Bulgaria. He said that this program clearly depicts the brilliant prospects of socialist development in Bulgaria.

　　保加利亚社会主义发展前景辉煌
    新五年计划规定工农业总产量将分别增加百分之六十和三十五
    于哥夫向保共七大报告新五年计划指示
    新华社索菲亚5日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫5日在保共第七次代表大会上作报告说，目前保加利亚面临的任务是：一方面要巩固、改进和发展社会主义的生产关系，另一方面要依靠日益加强的社会主义生产关系来继续发展生产力和增加生产。
    于哥夫在作关于1958年到1962年保加利亚发展国民经济第三个五年计划的指示的报告时说：我国在执行第二个五年计划中所取得的巨大成就为我国进一步建设社会主义社会打下了广阔的和巩固的基础。这些成就从根本上改变了我国的面貌。他强调说，社会主义的生产关系在我国已经完全占有统治的地位。现在国民经济中社会主义成分在工业总产值中占98％，在农业总产值中占90％以上，在零售贸易中占99％以上。于哥夫接着说，由于保加利亚第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）任务的顺利完成，由于国家经济和社会阶级结构的深刻变化，社会主义这个新的社会制度在保加利亚已经取得了胜利，完成了从资本主义生产关系向社会主义的过渡。
    他说，但是必须估计到，由于资本主义遗留下来的国家经济十分落后，暂时只有不大一部分居民从事工业，工业原料基地的发展仍然不够。生产力发展的水平还不足以下结论说我国的社会主义社会的建设已经完成。
    于哥夫在谈到第三个五年计划期间发展经济的基本方向时说，关于第三个五年计划的指示草案规定，到1962年，工业总产量至少要比1957年增加60％。那时工业同农业的比例关系大约将达到七十比三十。他说，这就是说，保加利亚将日益变成先进的工业—农业的社会主义国家。
    第三个五年计划期间农业方面最重要的任务是：最合理地使用土地、机器，保证稳定的丰收，达到牧畜业的高度生产率和坚决减少单位产品的生产费用。
    指示草案规定，1962年农业总产量将比1957年增加大约35％。农业中的社会主义成分将在农作物产量方面占97％以上，在畜牧业产量方面占96％左右。
    于哥夫指出，如果没有广泛地发展农业的第二个部门——畜牧业、首先是公有畜牧业，那么有关发展农业以及农业各部门正确配合的任务就不可能得到合理的解决。为了解决这一任务，规定在五年计划期间大大增加牲畜头数，改善牛、羊、猪等的品种。
    指示草案规定第三个五年计划期间的投资额约为二百六十七亿三千五百万列弗（保币名），而第二个五年计划规定的是二百亿零六千五百万列弗（按1956年价格计算）。
    于哥夫指出，进一步提高国民经济各部门的劳动生产率将为实现六、七小时工作制创造现实的可能。
    于哥夫接着指出，在第三个五年计划中规定实行许多措施来进一步提高劳动人民的物质福利，发展科学、教育和艺术，以及进一步提高人民的文化水平。1962年城乡劳动人民的实际收入将比1957年增加30％。国民收入在这一时期内将增加大约50％。学校中将保证逐步过渡到综合技术教育。
    于哥夫强调指出，党和政府一贯实行同苏联和其他社会主义国家加强团结、友好和经济合作的政策。由于实行这种政策，保加利亚才能够在短时期内取得了辉煌的成绩。
    于哥夫说，保加利亚共产党人愤怒地驳斥南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领起草人硬说苏联想取得“霸权”和“剥削”其他社会主义国家的谰言。苏联帮助我国和其他社会主义国家的唯一动机是为了繁荣这些国家的经济和文化，加强和发展社会主义世界体系。只可能有这样的动机而不可能有其他的动机，因为我们的人民是受着同一个思想——马克思列宁主义思想——的鼓舞，我们有着同一个目的——社会主义的胜利，共产主义的胜利。
    于哥夫说，我国从苏联和其他社会主义国家获得的兄弟般的无私援助同帝国主义国家给较小的资本主义国家和不发达国家的“援助”两者之间难道能划等号吗？不，不能划这种等号！因此，我们保加利亚共产党人坚决谴责南斯拉夫领导人把苏联同我们或者对任何友好国家的关系和帝国主义国家同其他不发达国家的关系混为一谈的企图。十分奇怪的是，南斯拉夫领导人竟广泛地散布一种神话，说什么南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国同美国进行着平等的合作，说从美国得到的援助符合南斯拉夫人民的利益。你们看，当滚到修正主义泥沼里去的时候，就会堕落到怎样的地步！于哥夫接着列举事实说明保加利亚同苏联和其他社会主义国家经济合作的成就。他说，据初步统计，最近五年中，同社会主义国家的贸易占保加利亚进出口贸易总额的80％。
    于哥夫在报告结束时指出，提交保共第七次代表大会通过的关于第三个五年计划的指示是保加利亚进一步发展社会主义的伟大纲领。他说，这个纲领明确地描绘了保加利亚社会主义发展的光辉前景。
