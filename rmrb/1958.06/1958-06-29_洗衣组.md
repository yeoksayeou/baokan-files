    Laundry Group
    Poem by Huang Qingyun, Illustration by Lin Wan and Cui

Three little darlings, posing a riddle for Mom to guess:
“Hands wipe down, white clouds rise;
Rinse with clear water, white clouds disappear,
Revealing flowers, how lovely.”

“You stand in front, I stand behind,
You twist left, I twist right;
The more it rains,
The drier the flowers become.”

Mom, if you guess it,
You'll surely say we're good babies;
Mom, if you can't guess,
Please come and see our laundry group.

    洗衣组
    黄庆云诗　林琬崔画三个小乖，说个谜儿妈妈猜：“双手擦下去，白云冒上来；清水漂漂白云散，露出花儿多可爱。”“你站前，我站后，你扭左，我扭右；雨儿愈是下得多，花儿愈是干得透。”妈妈，你若是猜得到，定说我们好宝宝；妈妈若是猜不到，请来看看我们的洗衣组。
