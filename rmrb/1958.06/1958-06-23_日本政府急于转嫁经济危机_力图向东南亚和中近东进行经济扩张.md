Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - The Kishi Nobusuke government is actively preparing to expand exports in an attempt to cope with Japan's economic crisis and carry out economic expansion.

According to Kyodo News, Minister of International Trade and Industry Tatsunosuke Takasaki and Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Takeo Miki jointly studied the issue of expanding Japan's exports on the 17th. The Economic Planning Agency also began drafting a "New Development Export Trade Plan" on the same day. The main content of the plan is to provide approximately one hundred million US dollars in yen credit loans to economically underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East to expand Japan's exports and extricate itself from its current economic crisis.

An economic crisis already looms over Japan. According to some statistics published by the Japanese government, Japan's production is declining sharply. In the eight months from July last year to February this year, the industrial and mining production index fell by 13%, and it is still declining. The inventory index continues to increase; taking 1955 as 100, it had increased to 158% by February this year. Among them, the inventory index of the machinery manufacturing industry had increased to 258.5% by January this year. At the same time, prices are falling, especially wholesale prices, which have fallen the most sharply. Taking June 1957 as 100, the price index had fallen by 11.5% by the end of May this year, of which metal prices fell sharply by 34.1% in the year up to February this year. The number of unemployed has increased significantly; by March this year, the number of fully unemployed had reached 850,000. According to Japanese newspapers, the number of fully unemployed is expected to exceed one million by the beginning of next year. These figures show that a cyclical economic crisis has begun to appear in Japan. The Japanese government's use of the term "economic recession" can no longer conceal this fact.

Due to the impact of the economic crisis in the capitalist world, Japan's exports have been decreasing in recent months. The export value in April and May did not reach 200 million US dollars, while Japan's original plan was to export 3.15 billion US dollars this year. Recently, Japanese economic circles generally believe that it will be difficult to maintain exports at the level of more than 2.8 billion US dollars last year. The newly appointed Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, also admitted that Japan's export prospects are bleak. The sluggish exports will further deepen and prolong the crisis in Japan's production, inventory, prices, and unemployment.

Japanese monopoly capital groups and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet have been stepping up activities in Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East in recent days, with the intention of economic expansion. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specifically established a "Near and Middle East Bureau" and an "Economic Cooperation Bureau." Japanese diplomatic envoys stationed in the United Arab Republic and Europe gathered in Rome on the 17th to study issues related to economic expansion. A "study group" composed of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry will soon depart for activities in Southeast Asia.

The series of economic expansion activities of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which has potential imperialist ambitions, are attracting the attention of Asian and African countries. However, the economic expansion activities of the Kishi Nobusuke government cannot solve Japan's economic crisis.

### 日本政府急于转嫁经济危机  力图向东南亚和中近东进行经济扩张

    日本政府急于转嫁经济危机
    力图向东南亚和中近东进行经济扩张
    新华社20日讯  东京消息：岸信介政府正在积极准备扩大输出，企图用来应付日本的经济危机和进行经济扩张。
    据共同社报道，通商产业相高碕达之助和经济企划厅长官三木武夫在17日共同研究了扩大日本的输出问题，经济企划厅并且在当天开始草拟“新的发展出口贸易方案”。方案的主要内容是对东南亚、中近东等经济不发达的国家提供日元信用贷款约计一亿美元，用来扩大日本的输出，以便摆脱日本目前的经济危机局面。
    经济危机已经笼罩着日本。据日本官方发表的一些统计数字，日本的生产在急剧下降，从去年7月到今年2月的八个月中间，工矿业生产指数下降了13％，目前还在继续下降，库存指数不断增加，如果以1955年为一百，到今年2月已经增加到158％，其中，机器制造业的库存指数到今年1月已经增加到258.5％；同时，物价下跌，尤其是批发价格跌得最猛，如果以1957年6月为一百，到今年5月底物价指数已经下跌了11.5％，其中金属价格在到今年2月的一年内就猛跌了34.1％；失业人数大大增加，到今年3月完全失业人数已经达到八十五万，据日本报刊估计，明年初完全失业人数就要突破一百万。这些数字说明，一个周期性的经济危机已经开始在日本出现，日本官方用“经济衰退”的字样已经遮掩不住这个事实了。
    由于资本主义世界经济危机的影响，近几个月来日本的输出额不断减少，4、5两个月都没有达到二亿美元，而日本的原订计划是在今年内输出三十一亿五千万美元。近来，日本经济界一致认为今年出口维持在去年的二十八亿多美元的水平已经很困难了。刚上台的通商产业相高碕达之助也承认，日本的出口前途是黯淡的。由于出口不振，将使日本的生产、库存、物价，和失业等各方面的危机更加深刻化和长期化。
    日本垄断资本集团和岸信介内阁，这几天正在本着经济扩张的意图向东南亚和中近东加紧进行活动。据报道，日本外务省已经专门成立了“中近东局”和“经济合作局”；日本派驻阿拉伯联合共和国和欧洲的外交使节已经在17日齐集在罗马研究同经济扩张有关问题；由日本商工会议所和东京商工会议所组成的“考察团”，不久就要出发到东南亚活动。
    具有潜在的帝国主义野心的岸信介政府的一系列经济扩张活动，正在引起亚非国家的注意。但是，岸信介政府的经济扩张的活动并不能解救日本的经济危机。
