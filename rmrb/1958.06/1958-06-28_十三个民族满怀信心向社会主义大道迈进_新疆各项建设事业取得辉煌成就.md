Thirteen Nationalities March Towards Socialism with Full Confidence
Remarkable Achievements in Various Construction Undertakings in Xinjiang

(Reported by this newspaper) In the past eight years, the economic and cultural construction undertakings of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have achieved unprecedented development. The vast people of thirteen nationalities are marching confidently on the road to socialism.

Currently, the most profound and historically significant change in Xinjiang's society is that socialist relations of production have taken a dominant position in the vast rural and pastoral areas of the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Organized and planned collective production has become the main form of production. By 1957, 97.6% of farmers in the region had joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the socialist transformation of pastoral areas was basically completed this spring. A prosperous scene of building socialism is evident everywhere in the vast rural and pastoral areas.

While the relations of production are gradually changing, the productive forces of all nationalities in Xinjiang have leaped forward with the support of the state and the people of the whole country. In the past eight years, from an almost non-existent industrial base, all nationalities have established more than 400 modern factories and mines, including iron and steel, petroleum, coal, machinery, electricity, chemicals, textiles, and flour processing. Karamay, one of China's largest oil fields, is also under accelerated construction. In 1957, the total output value of modern industry increased more than sixty-five times compared with 1949, accounting for 27.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The establishment of modern industry has not only changed the historical situation in Xinjiang of relying entirely on the supply of industrial products from other regions, and strongly supported the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in Xinjiang, but also enabled the working class, including all nationalities, to grow rapidly.

In the past eight years, more than 10,000 kilometers of highways have been built and repaired on the vast land of Xinjiang. Before liberation, Xinjiang had only more than 3,000 *li* of highways, most of which were impassable due to disrepair. After the highway network connected all the cities on the plains, it is now extending to remote areas of the Tianshan Mountains and the Pamir Plateau. More than 98% of the townships in the region have access to postal routes, and more than 400 districts and townships have access to telephones. Six air routes centered on Urumqi have also been opened.

Due to the construction of irrigation systems under the icy peaks of the Tianshan, Altai, and Kunlun Mountains, agricultural production in the oases of the Tarim Basin and Junggar Basin, which receive little rainfall throughout the year, has achieved tremendous development. During the First Five-Year Plan period, more than 60,000 kilometers of canals were expanded and newly built. The irrigated area in 1949 was only more than 15 million *mu*, but in 1957 it reached more than 25.7 million *mu*. In 1957, the region's grain output more than doubled compared with 1950. The average amount of grain possessed by each farmer increased from 447 *jin* in 1949 to 733 *jin* in 1957. In 1957, the unit area yield of cotton in the region reached the 60 *jin* target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). In recent years, large quantities of Xinjiang cotton have been transported to other regions to support the country's industrial construction. Profound changes have taken place in agricultural production tools and farming techniques. Advanced technologies have been widely adopted by farmers of all nationalities, and the old and crude "two-oxen-pulling-the-plow" style farm implements have been basically replaced by thousands of new-style animal-powered farm implements and agricultural machinery.

Animal husbandry, which ranks second only to agriculture in the national economy, has also made great progress. In 1957, the number of livestock of all kinds reached more than 20 million head, an increase of more than 70% compared with the early days of liberation, exceeding the highest historical record by more than 5 million head. The quality of livestock is also improving, and fine breeds such as Xinjiang sheep are being widely promoted in various pastures. Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, and Tajik herders, who have achieved basic victory in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, are working hard on the grasslands of the Tianshan, Pamir, and Altai Mountains to change the primitive nomadic lifestyle and management methods of following water and grass.

The lives of all nationalities have been significantly improved with the development of various construction undertakings. In 1957, the total social purchasing power of the region increased by 1.25 times compared with 1952.

By 1957, the total number of large, medium, and small schools in Xinjiang had increased to 2,657, an increase of 159.66% compared with 1949. These schools have a total of 571,900 students, accounting for 10.3% of the region's population, an increase of more than 160% compared with the early days of liberation. In the past five years, eleven secondary specialized schools such as mining, petroleum, agriculture and animal husbandry, and health have been newly built. In addition to the original Xinjiang College, institutions of higher learning also include the August 1st Agricultural College, the Languages College, the Medical College, and the Normal College. At present, the number of medical institutions in the region has increased eight times compared with before liberation, and the total number of beds is equivalent to five times that of before liberation. Other cultural and artistic, publishing, sports, and other undertakings have also developed rapidly. All these achievements have changed the face of Xinjiang and laid a good foundation for Xinjiang's various construction undertakings to reach new heights in the Second Five-Year Plan. (Wang Boqing)

    十三个民族满怀信心向社会主义大道迈进
    新疆各项建设事业取得辉煌成就
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区的经济、文化建设事业，在过去的八年中得到空前未有的发展。十三个民族的广大人民正满怀信心地在社会主义大道上迈进。
    目前，新疆社会中变化最深刻且具有历史意义的事实是，在天山南北广大农村和牧区，社会主义生产关系已经占了统治地位，有组织有计划的集体生产成了生产中的主要形式。到1957年，全区97.6％的农户参加了农业生产合作社，牧区的社会主义改造也在今春基本完成。广大农村和牧区到处呈现一片建设社会主义的繁荣景象。
    在生产关系逐步改变的同时，新疆各族人民在国家和全国人民的支援下，生产力飞跃提高。八年来，各族人民在几乎毫无工业的基础上，建立了钢铁、石油、煤炭、机械、电力、化学、纺织、面粉加工等现代化工厂、矿山共四百多个。我国最大油田之一的克拉玛依也正在加紧建设中。1957年现代工业总产值比1949年增加了六十五倍多，已经占到工农业总产值的27.7％。现代工业的建立，不仅改变了新疆历史上完全依靠外地供应工业品的状况，有力地支援了新疆农牧业的发展，而且使包括各民族的工人阶级队伍迅速成长起来。
    八年来，在新疆辽阔的土地上修筑和整修了一万多公里公路，而解放前新疆只有三千多里公路，绝大部分因年久失修不能畅通。公路网联结起平原上所有的城市后，现在正向着天山和帕米尔高原的偏远地区延伸。全区已有98％以上的乡通了邮路，四百多个区、乡通了电话。以乌鲁木齐为中心的六条航线也已经开辟。
    由于在天山、阿尔泰山和昆仑山的冰山雪峰下修筑了灌溉系统，使终年少雨的塔里木盆地和准噶尔盆地绿洲上的农业生产，获得巨大发展。第一个五年计划期间，扩建和新建渠道六万多公里。1949年的灌溉面积只有一千五百多万亩，而1957年就达到了两千五百七十多万亩。1957年全区粮食产量较1950年增加了一倍。每个农民平均占有的粮食已由1949年的四百四十七斤，增加到1957年的七百三十三斤。1957年全区棉花的单位面积产量，已经达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的六十斤的指标。几年来新疆棉花大批外运，支援了国家的工业建设。农业中的生产工具和耕作技术已经发生了深刻的变化。先进的技术为各族农民普遍采用，古老粗陋的“二牛抬杠”式农具，已基本上为成千上万的新式畜力农具和农业机械所代替。
    在国民经济中仅次于农业的畜牧业也有很大发展。1957年，各种牲畜头数已达到两千多万头，比解放初期增加了70％以上，超过历史上最高纪录五百多万头。牲畜质量也在提高，新疆羊等优良畜种正在各个牧场广泛推广。已在畜牧业社会主义改造中取得基本胜利的哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜和塔吉克族牧民，正在天山、帕米尔、阿尔泰山的草原上，为改变原始的逐水草游牧的生活方式和经营方式而辛勤劳动。
    各族人民的生活，随着各项建设事业的发展得到了显著改善。1957年全区的社会购买力比1952年增加了一点二五倍。
    到1957年，新疆大、中、小学校的总数已增加到二千六百五十七所，比1949年增加了159.66％。这些学校的学生共有五十七万一千九百人，占全自治区人口的10.3％，比解放初期增加了160％以上。最近五年来，新建了矿业、石油、农牧、卫生等中等专业学校十一所，高等学校除原有的新疆学院外，还建立了八一农学院、语文学院、医学院和师范学院。目前，全区医疗机构比解放前增加了八倍，病床总数相当于解放前的五倍。其他文化艺术、出版、体育等事业也有了迅速发展。这一切成就改变了新疆的面貌，并为新疆各项建设事业在第二个五年计划内达到新的高峰奠定了良好基础。　　　（汪波清）
