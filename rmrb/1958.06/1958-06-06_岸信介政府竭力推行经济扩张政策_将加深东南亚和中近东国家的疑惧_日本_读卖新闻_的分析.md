Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun" is worried that the Kishida Nobusuke government's "economic diplomacy" policy, which is being promoted under the name of "economic cooperation" but is actually aimed at expansion, will cause increasing apprehension among Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries.

The influential Japanese bourgeois newspaper recently pointed out in its analysis of the Kishida Nobusuke government's "economic diplomacy" policy that although Kishida and his powerful cabinet members have agreed with some countries to conduct "economic cooperation" and provide them with yen loans, they have adopted harsh policies in the concrete implementation stage. In terms of trade, Japan strictly restricts the export of goods from the other country to Japan, while forcing the other country to purchase Japanese complete sets of equipment through deferred payment methods, which makes the other country suspicious of Japan's "economic diplomacy" policy and "economic cooperation" with Japan.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" cited an example, saying that Japan's provision of 18 billion yen in loans to India within three years is essentially an expansion of exports to India through deferred payment, and the amount of loans confirms the amount of Japan's expanded exports to India. For example, the Kishida Nobusuke government sent former Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, Takasaki Tatsunosuke, to visit Egypt at the beginning of this year. At that time, Takasaki expressed Japan's willingness to conduct "economic cooperation" with Egypt. However, in the subsequent concrete trade between the two countries, Japan disregarded the Egyptian side's opinion and unilaterally stopped exports to Egypt for the trade settlement between the two countries. The newspaper is worried that other countries will become more distrustful of Japan in the long run.

The "Southeast Asia Development Plan" that Kishida Nobusuke had vigorously peddled to Southeast Asian countries, which aimed to develop the resources of Southeast Asian countries using American funds and Japanese technology, was declared bankrupt because the United States was unwilling to provide funds and Southeast Asian countries were suspicious of it. Subsequently, the Kishida Nobusuke government stepped up its efforts to formulate a plan for Japan to provide its own funds to "develop Southeast Asia" in order to continue its economic expansion policy. At the beginning of this year, the Kishida Nobusuke government established a 5 billion yen "Asian Development Fund." Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also been planning to establish a "Prime Minister's Fund for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises" to "assist" Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries in "supporting small and medium-sized enterprises." After the establishment of the second Kishida Nobusuke cabinet, concrete consultations will be held on the establishment of this "Prime Minister's Fund." It is reported that Kishida Nobusuke himself is also preparing to go to the Asian and African regions again to peddle "economic diplomacy" after the establishment of the new cabinet.

However, some news from Southeast Asian countries shows that the Kishida Nobusuke government will not have a smooth ride in promoting its economic expansion policy. After the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, visited Japan and issued a joint statement with Kishida Nobusuke announcing that Malaya would provide a market for Japanese industrial products, Singapore newspapers immediately reported on the 3rd that this statement had caused panic among people in Malaya about Japan dumping goods there.

### 岸信介政府竭力推行经济扩张政策  将加深东南亚和中近东国家的疑惧  日本“读卖新闻”的分析

　　岸信介政府竭力推行经济扩张政策
    将加深东南亚和中近东国家的疑惧
    日本“读卖新闻”的分析
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本“读卖新闻”担心岸信介政府正在推行的以进行“经济合作”为名而实际上在于进行扩张的“经济外交”政策将引起东南亚和中近东国家的日益加深的疑惧。
    日本的这家有影响的资产阶级报纸最近在分析岸信介政府的“经济外交”政策时指出，岸信介和他的有势力的阁员虽然同一些国家约定进行“经济合作”，并且向它们提供日元贷款，但是到了具体实施阶段却采取了苛刻的方针。在贸易方面，日本严格限制对方国家向日本输出，同时用延期付款的办法强使对方国家购买日本的成套设备，这样就使对方国家对日本的“经济外交”政策和同日本进行“经济合作”这件事发生怀疑。
    “读卖新闻”举例说，日本在三年内向印度提供一百八十亿日元的贷款，实质上是用延期付款的方式向印度扩大输出，并且通过确定贷款数额肯定了日本向印度扩大输出的数额。又如，岸信介政府在今年初曾经派前任经济企划厅长官高崎达之助访问了埃及。当时高崎表示日本愿意同埃及进行“经济合作”。但是在其后两国具体进行贸易的过程中，日本却无视埃及方面的意见，单方面停止了用于两国贸易结算的对埃输出。报纸担心长此下去其它国家将更加不信任日本。
    岸信介曾经极力向东南亚国家兜售的利用美国资金和日本技术开发东南亚国家资源的“东南亚开发计划”，由于美国不愿意提供资金和东南亚国家对之怀有疑虑而宣告破产。其后，岸信介政府就加紧制定由日本自己提供资金来“开发东南亚”的计划，以便继续推行它的经济扩张政策。今年初，岸信介政府已经设立了五十亿日元的“亚洲开发基金”。最近，外务省又在计划设立“中小企业首相基金”，用来“协助”东南亚和中近东各国“扶植中小企业”。第二次岸信介内阁成立之后，将就建立这项“首相基金”的问题进行具体协商。有消息说，岸信介本人还准备在新内阁成立之后，再次到亚非地区去兜售“经济外交”。
    但是，来自东南亚国家的一些消息表明，岸信介政府在推行它的经济扩张政策过程中将不会是顺利的。在马来亚联合邦总理拉赫曼访问日本，并且同岸信介发表联合声明宣布马来亚将为日本的工业品提供市场以后，新加坡报纸立即在3日报道，这项声明已经引起马来亚人士对日本向当地倾销商品的恐慌。
