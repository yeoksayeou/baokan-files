Why are Bourgeois Intellectuals Considered an Exploiting Class?
Zhejiang Agricultural College Teachers and Students Engage in Debate

    (Report from Zhejiang Daily) A fierce debate has erupted among teachers and students at Zhejiang Agricultural College regarding the question: "Why are bourgeois intellectuals considered an exploiting class?"

    One side of the debate believes that classifying current bourgeois intellectuals as an exploiting class is inappropriate. Their reasoning is threefold: First, the standard for classifying classes is their economic and productive position. Currently, intellectuals rely primarily or entirely on wage income for their livelihood and do not exploit the labor of others. Second, intellectuals are a special stratum. In the old society, although Chinese intellectuals served the reactionary ruling class, they were ultimately mental laborers who were also oppressed by the three major enemies: feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. After liberation, the Party and the state included intellectuals in the working class, and they can join trade unions. If they belong to the exploiting class, why can they join trade unions? Is there a contradiction? Third, if we classify bourgeois intellectuals based on their current political and ideological outlook, does that mean that anyone with bourgeois individualism should be categorized as belonging to the exploiting class?

    The other side of the debate believes that Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, which states that the majority of bourgeois intellectuals are in a wavering transitional state between socialism and capitalism, is entirely correct. Acknowledging this is of great benefit to the self-reform of intellectuals. They believe that the intellectuals referred to here are the bourgeois intellectuals "in a wavering transitional state" and should not include worker-class intellectuals who have been transformed into both red and expert. The reasoning is: First, most intellectuals in old China came from non-proletarian families, and the education they received was bourgeois. Although they have made some progress under the Party's education in the years since liberation, their worldview and outlook on life are still incompatible with the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation, and most intellectuals cannot yet be said to have completed this transformation." Many comrades cited the erroneous words and deeds exposed by some intellectuals during the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, the Double-Anti movement, and the heart-to-heart talk movement to illustrate that bourgeois intellectuals, before they are thoroughly reformed, do indeed belong to the exploiting class. The conclusion in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report is entirely appropriate and correct. This is an objective reality, not subjective conjecture. Second, although intellectuals are a stratum, these intellectuals belong to different classes and serve different classes. At present, bourgeois intellectuals still have a dual nature: on the one hand, they are mental laborers who rely on wage income as their source of livelihood, and therefore are included in the working class and can join trade unions; on the other hand, they are incompatible with the glorious title of members of the working class, so they must accelerate their ideological transformation and establish a worker-class ideology; only in this way can they shoulder the great task of socialist construction. Third, we cannot classify everyone with some bourgeois individualistic thoughts as a bourgeois intellectual. The criteria for measuring whether someone is a bourgeois intellectual should be based not only on their economic status, but also on their political attitude and class stance. We cannot sever ourselves from history when looking at the problem. At present, we must look at their attitude and stance towards the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Some bourgeois intellectuals, from an economic standpoint, no longer engage in exploitation. However, before their bourgeois worldview and outlook on life are changed, their guiding ideology still belongs to the bourgeois system, and therefore, they should be classified as belonging to the exploiting class. For example, the landlord class, as a class, has been eliminated through land reform, but before landlord class elements are transformed into laboring peasants, they still belong to their original class.

    Currently, the debate on this issue is still ongoing.

### 为什么说资产阶级知识分子属于剥削阶级？  浙江农学院师生展开论战

    为什么说资产阶级知识分子属于剥削阶级？
    浙江农学院师生展开论战
    本报讯　据浙江日报报道：“为什么说资产阶级知识分子属于剥削阶级”的问题，已在浙江农学院广大师生中开展了激烈的争论。
    争论的一方，认为把目前资产阶级知识分子划入剥削阶级是不妥当的。理由有三：第一，划分阶级的标准是所处的经济地位和生产地位。目前知识分子都以工资收入为主要或全部生活来源，并没有剥削别人的劳动。第二，知识分子是特殊的阶层。在旧社会，我国知识分子虽然是为反动统治阶级服务的，但他们终究是脑力劳动者，同样受到封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人的压迫。解放后，党和国家把知识分子列入工人阶级，他们可以加入工会。既然属于剥削阶级，为什么可加入工会，这样是否有矛盾？第三，如果从目前知识分子政治思想面貌来划分，说资产阶级知识分子属于剥削阶级，那么，是否凡是有资产阶级个人主义思想的人，都应该列入剥削阶级范畴？
    争论的另一方，认为刘少奇同志报告中所说资产阶级知识分子，他们的大多数人在社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间处在动摇的过渡状态的论断十分正确。承认这一点，对知识分子自我改造有很大的推动作用。他们认为这里所指的知识分子是指“处在动摇的过渡状态”的资产阶级知识分子，不应该包括已经改造成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。理由是：第一，旧中国的知识分子多半出身于非无产阶级家庭，受到的教育都是资产阶级的教育。解放几年来，在党的教育下虽有一定的进步，但他们的世界观、人生观与社会主义事业全面大跃进的形势仍然是不相适应的，正如毛主席所指出的：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变”。许多同志列举有些知识分子在大鸣大放和双反运动以及交心运动中暴露出来的错误言行，说明资产阶级知识分子在没有彻底改造好之前，确是属于剥削阶级的，刘少奇同志报告中的论断是完全恰当的、正确的。这是客观的存在，并不是主观的臆测。第二，知识分子虽然是一个阶层，但这些知识分子分别属于不同的阶级，为不同阶级服务。目前，资产阶级知识分子还有两面性：一方面他是脑力劳动者，以工资收入作为自己的生活来源，因而列入工人阶级，可以参加工会；另一方面，他们又与工人阶级成员的光荣称号不相适应，所以他们必须加速改造思想，树立工人阶级思想；只有这样，才能担负伟大的社会主义建设任务。第三，不能把所有存在一些资产阶级个人主义思想的人，都列为资产阶级知识分子。衡量是否资产阶级知识分子的标准，不但要根据他们的经济地位，而且要看政治态度、阶级立场。我们不能割断历史来看问题。在目前，就要看他们对于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争所抱的态度和立场。有的资产阶级知识分子，从经济基础看，已不存在剥削行为。但在他们的资产阶级世界观与人生观没有改变以前，他们的指导思想还是属于资产阶级体系的，因此，应该列入剥削阶级。如地主阶级作为一个阶级，通过土改已被消灭了，但是地主阶级分子没有改造成为劳动农民之前，仍然是属于他原来的阶级的。
    目前，关于这个问题的争论仍在继续进行。
