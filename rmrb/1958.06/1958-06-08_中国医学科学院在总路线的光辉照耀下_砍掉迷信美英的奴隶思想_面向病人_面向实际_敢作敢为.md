　　The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line,
	Cuts Away the Slavish Ideology of Blindly Believing in America and Britain
	Faces the Patients, Faces Reality, and Dares to Act
　　(Our dispatch) A huge high tide of breaking superstitions and liberating thought is being whipped up among all the experts, professors, and technical personnel of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Deep-rooted ideologies of worshipping America and Britain blindly and belittling oneself are beginning to step down, and the ideology of extreme individualism centered on "I" has nowhere to hide. Many things that people dared not think or do in the past, they have now thought of and done. This is a completely new leaping forward situation that has emerged under the brilliant illumination of the General Line.
　　In the past, because many of the experts and professors here had studied abroad in capitalist countries, and the younger generation was cultivated by them, this created a general and firm ideological form of blindly worshipping foreign countries and blindly believing in America and Britain. People treated British and American literature as the Bible, bowed down to British and American literature, and regarded following the tail of Western medicine as an honor. Scientific problems that foreign countries had not solved, such as tumors, leukemia, and heart disease, they did not even dare to think about, believing that "American and British scholars have no way, how can we do it?" They dared not say anything that foreigners had not said, believing that the scientific frameworks of Western countries were sacrosanct and inviolable. In short, from research thinking to research methods, from service attitude to rules and regulations, everything was still the American way.
　　Due to the existence of serious bourgeois individualism, they single-mindedly pursued fame and fortune, sought unpopular fields, sought shortcuts, engaged in the "black market," engaged in the "free market," and refused to study diseases that most seriously endanger people's health, or opened small gaps under the big hat of "national tasks." In this rectification movement, through the great debate on the two roads and two methods of scientific research and medical work, they ruined the capitalist research direction, ruined bourgeois individualism, and turned out the bottom of old "Peking Union Medical College Hospital" (Peking Union Medical College Hospital is now the affiliated hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences). Everyone saw how much "good deeds" people who blindly believed in America had done for the people. Especially in the booming study of the General Line, they received profound education and encouragement. The countless vivid examples in the leap forward in industry and agriculture infected the thoughts of many people. The "golden hoop" on their heads was broken, the blind belief in America and Britain was broken, and their minds were liberated. People put forward the bold words of "making cancer bow its head and letting hypertension give way."
　　Now, the whole academy is full of red flowers, the enthusiasm is soaring, and the ambitions are high. Scientists from ten institutes and departments such as physiology, pathology, occupational health, biochemistry, and internal medicine have decided to vigorously invest in the comprehensive investigation and research of silicosis, and many old scientists will personally go to the site. On the 6th, the academy leadership held a comprehensive tumor research meeting to deploy the battle. The Department of Internal Medicine decided to immediately open up a "test field" in the Dongdan District to conduct a general survey of hypertension and heart disease, and to carry out treatment and prevention work. The Department of Public Health has now decided to fully invest in cooperating with Beijing's task of "eliminating dysentery." With the cooperation and support of various departments, the Institute of Occupational Health is preparing to formulate a national silicosis prevention and control plan based on three months of on-site investigation and research. The comrades of the Department of Nutrition are determined to go to various places to investigate, thoroughly understand the national nutritional status within two years, and solve problems on the spot and train local cadres on the spot. The advanced plans and advanced actions of various departments inspire and encourage each other, thus forming a high tide of the entire medical science leap forward.
　　Peking Union Medical College Hospital was established by American imperialism to promote a policy of cultural aggression, and all its systems were American-style. The hospital does not serve patients, but requires patients to serve the hospital; doctors do not serve patients, but serve personal fame and fortune. The serious thing is that after liberation, there are still quite a few people who are nostalgic for the American imperialist set and attempt to maintain the "Peking Union Medical College Hospital standard" (which is essentially the British and American standard). Many hospitals across the country have successively implemented three-shift clinics, but some people in Peking Union Medical College Hospital still disagree with the implementation of three-shift clinics under the pretext of "Peking Union Medical College Hospital special" and "research special." All doctors, nurses, and staff members of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the Tumor Hospital thoroughly exposed and liquidated capitalist medical ideology, medical style, and rules and regulations in the great debate. People absorbed tremendous strength from the study of the General Line and quickly shattered the various constraints such as the so-called "Peking Union Medical College Hospital standard." On the evening of June 3, after studying the General Line, combined with the discussion of the report by Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Health, on thoroughly reforming hospital work, the personnel of the two hospitals unanimously took action overnight, immediately crossed the three-shift clinic (8:00 am to 8:00 pm), and implemented a 24-hour clinic system. Many department directors and professors personally went to the clinic to participate in and guide the work. Simple beds were also prepared overnight, and patients were admitted the next day. Many departments are also actively brewing preparations to further open family beds to meet the needs of the masses. In terms of service attitude, they have formulated specific regulations to compete with "Tianqiao." Nursing workers quickly put forward more than 300 specific opinions on reforming nursing work. Other new regulations that face patients and facilitate the masses, such as lowering fees, quick medicine collection, quick delivery of test reports and photo reports, have also appeared one after another. Surgery, obstetrics and gynecology have also improved surgical operations, shortening the operation time and the length of hospital stay.
　　Overnight leap, a brand-new look. Welcomes and praises immediately replaced the dissatisfaction and criticism on the suggestion book. Big-character posters praising medical staff appeared on the walls of the clinic corridors. Cancer patients who came to Beijing that night could go to the Tumor Hospital for treatment immediately without having to wait until the next day. A patient from Hunan who came to Beijing originally heard how difficult it was to see a doctor at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, but he did not expect to see a doctor at Peking Union Medical College Hospital on April 1 and was overjoyed.

　　中国医学科学院在总路线的光辉照耀下
    砍掉迷信美英的奴隶思想
    面向病人  面向实际  敢作敢为
    本报讯　在中国医学科学院的全体专家、教授、技术人员中，正在掀起一个空前巨大的破除迷信、解放思想的高潮。根深蒂固的崇拜英美和妄自菲薄的奴隶思想开始下台，以“我”为中心的极端个人主义思想已无藏身之地。过去许多不敢想不敢作的事，今天想出来了，也作出来了。这是在总路线的光辉照耀下出现的一个全新的跃进局面。
    过去，由于这里的许多专家教授是在资本主义国家留学回来的，而年轻的一代又是他们培养出来的，这就造成一种普遍的牢固的盲目崇拜外国、迷信英美的意识形态。人们把英美文献当作圣经，拜倒在英美文献之下，以追随西方医学的尾巴为荣耀。凡是外国没有解决的科学问题如肿瘤、白血病、心脏病等，就连想也不敢想，认为“英美学者都没办法，我们怎么能行？”凡是外国人没说过的话，就不敢说，认为西方国家的科学框框是天经地义、神圣不可触犯的。总之，从研究思想到研究方法，从服务态度到规章制度，还都是美国的一套。
    由于存在着严重的资产阶级个人主义，他们一味追求名利，找冷门、找捷径，搞“黑市”，搞“自由市场”，拒绝研究危害人民健康最严重的疾病，或者是在“国家任务”的大帽子底下开了小差。在这次整风运动中，通过对科学研究、医疗工作两条道路、两种方法的大辩论，搞臭了资本主义研究方向，搞臭了资产阶级个人主义，翻出了老“协和”（协和医院现在是中国医学科学院的附属医院）的底子，大家看到了迷信美国的人究竟为人民作了多少“好事”。特别是在轰轰烈烈的总路线学习中受到了深刻的教育和鼓舞，工农业跃进中的无数生动实例感染了许多人的思想，他们头上的“紧箍咒”打破了，对英美的迷信破除了，思想解放了，人们提出了“要癌症低头，让高血压让路”的豪言壮语。
    现在，全院已是红花遍开，干劲冲天，壮志凌云。生理、病理、劳动卫生、生化、内科等十个所、系的科学家，决定大力投入矽肺的综合调查研究，许多老科学家都要亲自出马到现场去。6日，院领导召开了肿瘤综合研究会议，部署战斗。内科决定立刻在东单区开辟一块“试验田”，对高血压和心脏病进行普查，并且开展治疗和预防工作。公共卫生系现在决定全力投入配合北京市“消灭痢疾”的任务。劳动卫生研究所在各系的合作和支持下，准备在三个月现场调查研究的基础上，拟订出全国性矽肺防治方案。营养系的同志们决心到各地调查，在两年内把全国营养状况彻底摸清，并且就地解决问题，就地培养当地干部。各系的先进计划和先进行动相互启发相互鼓舞，从而形成了整个医学科学跃进的高潮。
    “协和”是美帝国主义为了推行文化侵略政策而开办的，它的一切制度都是美国式的。医院不是为病人服务，而是要病人为医院服务；大夫不是为病人服务，而是为个人名利服务。严重的是，在解放以后，仍旧有相当多的人留恋美帝国主义的一套，企图保持“协和标准”（实质上是英美标准）。全国很多医院都陆续实行三班门诊，协和仍旧有一些人在“协和特殊”、“研究特殊”等借口下，不同意实行三班门诊。协和医院和肿瘤医院的全体医生、护士工作人员在大辩论中，彻底揭露和清算了资本主义的医疗思想、医疗作风和规章制度。人们从总路线学习中，吸取了巨大的力量，很快地粉碎了所谓“协和标准”等各种束缚。6月3日晚上，两院人员在总路线学习中，结合讨论卫生部徐运北副部长关于彻底改革医院工作的报告以后，一致连夜行动起来，立即跨过三班门诊（早八点到晚八点），而实行了二十四小时门诊制，许多科主任、教授都亲临门诊参加和指导工作。简易病床也连夜准备就绪，第二天就开始收容病人，不少科还积极酝酿准备进一步开设家庭病床，来满足群众的需要。在服务态度上，他们纷纷制定出具体规定，同“天桥”竞赛。护理工作者很快提出了三百多条革新护理工作的具体意见。其他像降低收费、快速取药、快速出检验报告和照相报告、面向病人、便利群众的新的规章，也相继出现，外科、妇产科等还改进了手术操作，缩短了手术时间和住院日期。
    一夜奔腾，面貌全新。欢迎和赞扬马上代替了意见簿上的不满和批评。门诊走廊上出现了患者表扬医务人员的满墙大字报。当夜来到北京的癌症患者，用不着等到第二天，就可以立即到肿瘤医院就诊。湖南到北京来的一位患者，本来听说到“协和”看病如何困难，没想到4月1日到“协和”就看上了病，真是喜出望外。
