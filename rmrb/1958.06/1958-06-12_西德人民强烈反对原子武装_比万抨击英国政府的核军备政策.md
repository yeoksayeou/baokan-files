Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: According to TASS, Bonn: News of mass opposition to atomic armament continues to pour in from all over West Germany.

    The West German Miners' Union congress held in Munich on the 9th passed a resolution opposing the atomic armament of the West German army.

    The Miners' Union has nearly 600,000 members.

    The West German Public Service Workers' Union congress, which was held in Munich a few days ago, also opposed the atomic armament policy. The majority of delegates to this congress advocated that the West German Trade Union Federation conduct a vote among its 6.5 million members to allow them to express their attitude on the issue of atomic armament.

    West German university students are also actively participating in the mass movement against atomic armament. "Committees for the Struggle Against Atomic Armament" have been established in most universities.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: According to TASS, London, June 10th: The British House of Commons began discussing the issue of disarmament on the 10th. Labour Party representative Bevan emphasized the dangers of modern weapons. He also condemned the "theories" advocating nuclear weapons as "tools of defense" and "deterrents."

    Bevan fiercely criticized the British government's attitude towards the issue of disarmament, especially the British government's decision to equip the West German army with nuclear weapons. He emphasized that the vast majority of people in European countries consider this a "sinful mistake." He said: The Labour Party believes that "equipping the West German army with atomic weapons at a time when there is an unprecedented possibility of making progress in disarmament is a provocative crime. This is an extremely serious provocation to the Russians."

    When discussing the Soviet Union's policy on disarmament, Bevan said that it was not the Soviet Union, but some other country, that should be primarily responsible for the lack of progress on the issue of disarmament. Bevan said that the British government should answer why it "never seriously considers" some of the Soviet Union's recent proposals.

    Bevan also said that the British government should be "deeply ashamed" of its refusal to stop nuclear weapons testing.

    西德人民强烈反对原子武装
    比万抨击英国政府的核军备政策
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：从西德各地继续传来群众反对原子武装的消息。
    在慕尼黑举行的西德矿工工会代表大会9日通过决议，反对用原子武器武装西德军队。
    矿工工会有将近六十万会员。
    前几天在慕尼黑召开的西德公用事业职工工会代表大会也反对原子武装政策。这个代表大会的大多数代表都主张西德工会联合会在六百五十万会员中进行投票，让他们对原子武装问题表示态度。
    西德大学生也正在积极参加反对原子武装的群众性运动。在大多数大学中都已经成立了“反对原子武装斗争委员会”。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社伦敦10日讯：英国下院10日开始讨论裁军问题。工党代表比万着重指出了现代化武器的危险。他还谴责了主张把核武器当作“国防工具”和“威慑手段”的“理论”。
    比万激烈地抨击英国政府对裁军问题所采取的态度，特别是英国政府同意用核武器装备西德军队的决定。他强调指出，欧洲各国绝大多数人民认为这是一个“罪恶的错误”。他说：工党认为，“在裁军方面空前地有可能取得进展的时候，用原子武器装备西德军队是一种挑衅性的罪行。这是对俄国人进行极端严重的挑衅。”
    比万在谈到苏联对裁军问题的政策时说，首先应当对裁军问题上没有取得进展这种局面负责的不是苏联，而是某个其他国家。比万说，英国政府应当回答，为什么“从不认真考虑”苏联最近的一些建议。
    比万还说，英国政府应当因拒绝停止核武器试验而“深深感到羞耻”。
