Chongqing, June 12 (By our own correspondent) – Chongqing City, since mid-May, has organized a team of 20,000 people, including cadres, veteran workers, and activists, with one million people participating, to launch a large-scale production inspection focusing on industry, mainly to examine new problems arising from the implementation of the General Line. While the inspection team conveys and publicizes the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, it also resolves new contradictions according to the spirit of the General Line. The most significant problem discovered is the resurgence of new conservative ideas. The current struggle against the conservatives is the second round. The first round was the “Double Anti” campaign, and the result of the struggle was that most raised their targets. However, some still adopt a year-end accounting attitude toward the leap forward targets. A few even stand by with folded arms, wanting to lower the targets by taking advantage of the failure to complete the plan. Overall, concrete measures are not keeping up; in some cases, production is leaping forward too quickly, and measures are not keeping pace; in others, the original measures were not specific enough and needed to be increased or supplemented but were not resolved in time; some were satisfied with the sensational scenes, and originally had no measures or wanted to rely on state investment, increased equipment, and manpower to complete the task. Because the measures are not keeping up, there are many difficulties in equipment, raw materials, and manpower supply, so a considerable number of cadres have developed a fear of difficulty. The "promotion of retreat" faction then spread a series of skeptical arguments. The inspection team launched a sharp struggle against the conservatives.

    The resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the proposal of the General Line are powerful weapons for countering the conservatives. After presenting facts and reasoning, the focus was on criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas of some cadres who retreated in the face of difficulties and wanted to "dismount." The Municipal Party Committee decided that, unless there are special, significant, and insurmountable difficulties, the leap forward targets must not be changed (only "mount up," not "dismount"); at the same time, it will seize the two links of rectification and in-depth implementation of the General Line, strengthen specific assistance, vigorously develop measures, vigorously develop collaboration, and vigorously promote technological revolution. The current situation has fundamentally changed, and the conservatives have once again lowered their heads. Due to the transmission of the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, a new production upsurge has appeared again after the "Double Anti" campaign. For example, at the beginning of the inspection of the Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant, the annual steel output was set at 70,000 tons. The inspection team submitted this target for discussion by the masses. The workers proposed that as long as the secretary takes the lead and the factory director comes forward to solve the two key problems of the newly built open-hearth furnace and hot charging, they are confident of completing 120,000 tons. The factory has now revised its production target to 100,000 to 120,000 tons. The Xiyuan Electric Motor Factory and the Zhihua Machine Factory only completed about 10% of the monthly plan in the first half of May. After debate and increased measures, they overfulfilled the May plan.

Xinhua News Agency reported – Guangzhou City originally had only a few factories that could complete 50% of the annual leap forward plan in the first half of this year, but now the vast majority of factories are confident in completing or overfulfilling the leap forward plan. This is the result of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee's organization of the Red May Industrial Production Inspection Team, after inspecting the new right-leaning conservative ideas that emerged in the city's industrial production system during the Great Leap Forward.

    The factories in Guangzhou formulated this year's production leap forward plan during the rectification movement. The enthusiasm of the workers was high, and production rose steadily. However, the leading cadres of a considerable number of factories began to be satisfied with the existing achievements. In the previous period, when many factories generally encountered difficulties such as insufficient funds, factory buildings, equipment, labor, and raw materials, the factory leaders did not mobilize the masses to actively and courageously overcome them, but waited for the higher authorities to provide money and effort to solve them. This thinking affected the development of production. At that time, a considerable number of factories believed that it was impossible to complete the 50% target of the annual leap forward plan in the first half of the year.

    The inspection team organized by the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee adopted the method of "abstract discussion" and ideological confrontation to overcome the right-leaning conservative ideas of leading cadres. For example, the South District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of cadres attended by factory directors, party branch secretaries, and a few workers in the district to conduct discussions on how to improve the current production. The Lianguang Cloth Factory, which has the best factory buildings and equipment in the district, has very poor product quality, with a substandard cloth rate of 5%, but the leading cadres of this factory said at the forum: the leadership is willing to leap forward, but the workers and cadres are afraid of leaping forward, so the quality cannot be improved. The cadres of the Erlian Cloth Factory, whose conditions are much worse than this factory, introduced at the meeting that the substandard cloth rate had been reduced from 10% to 0.13% due to fully mobilizing the masses to find solutions, refuting the statement of the leading cadres of the Lianguang Factory. After debate and inspection, the leading cadres of the Lianguang Factory believed that the main reason was the right-leaning thinking of the leadership that did not deeply mobilize the masses and was content with the status quo. After returning to the factory, they immediately mobilized the masses to find solutions. As a result, the workers put forward dozens of rationalization proposals in a few days. Now the substandard cloth rate has been reduced to 0.5%. Before the meeting, 60% of the 119 factories in the district could not complete the plan for the first half of the year. Through the debate, except for a few factories with limited production, the leaders of the vast majority of factories wrote guarantees, expressing their confidence in completing the plan for the first half of the year.

    Is it necessary for the higher authorities to provide people and money to solve the lack of factory buildings, equipment, labor, raw materials, and funds? No. The inspection team found that the materials and equipment lacking in some factories were surplus to others, and even within the same factory. The inspection team organized various units to adjust and collaborate with each other, enabling several hundred factories and handicraft cooperatives in the city to solve their difficulties.

    At the same time, the inspection team went deep into various factories, mobilized the masses to offer suggestions, and launched a technical innovation movement. For example, after the inspection team mobilized the masses in the Guanghua Printing and Dyeing Factory to adopt methods such as widening the flower frame for printing and dyeing cloth, they could not only make up for the underproduction figures of the previous month, but also overfulfill the production tasks of the second quarter. After the workers of various factories in the South District were mobilized, they put forward more than 30,000 rationalization proposals in May, which is more than the total number in the first four months of this year. After some rationalization proposals were implemented, factories with poor equipment also produced products that reached domestic or international advanced levels.

    重庆广州大规模检查工业生产
    及时批判新的保守思想
    本报重庆12日电　重庆市从5月中旬开始，组织了一支包括干部、老工人、积极分子等两万人参加的队伍，群众参加的有一百万人，展开以工业为重点的生产大检查，主要是检查贯彻总路线中存在的新问题。检查团一边传达、宣传“八大”二次会议的精神，一边根据总路线精神解决新的矛盾，发现最主要的问题是新的保守思想又抬头。目前与保守派斗争是第二个回合。第一个回合是双反，斗争的结果是多数把指标拉上去了。但仍有一部分人对跃进指标抱年终算账的态度。个别人甚至冷眼旁观，想借完不成计划把指标拉下来。总的是具体措施跟不上，有的是生产跃进太快，措施来不及，有的是原来措施不具体，需要增加或补充，没有及时解决；有的满足于轰轰烈烈的场面，原来就没有什么措施或想依靠国家投资、增加设备、人力来完成任务。因为措施跟不上，在设备、原料、人力供应等方面有不少困难，因此相当一部分干部产生畏难情绪。“促退派”就出来散播一系列怀疑论调。检查团展开了反击保守派的尖锐斗争。
    “八大”二次会议决议和总路线的提出是反击保守派的有力武器。经过摆事实、讲道理，重点批判了一部分干部中见难而退、想“下马”的右倾保守思想。市委决定凡是没有特殊的重大的和不可克服的困难，跃进指标一律不准更动（只准“上马”不准“下马”）；同时抓住整风和深入贯彻总路线这两个环节，加强具体帮助，大搞措施、大搞协作和技术革命。目前情况已根本转变，保守派已再一次低下头去。由于传达了“八大”第二次会议的精神，继双反之后再一次出现了新的生产热潮。如重庆第三钢铁厂，在检查之初，今年钢产量定七万吨，检查组把这个指标交群众讨论，工人提出只要书记挂帅，厂长出马，解决新建平炉和热装两个关键问题，有把握完成十二万吨。现这个厂已把生产指标修订为十万到十二万吨。西原电机厂、治华机器厂5月上半月只完成月计划10％左右，经过辩论，增加措施后，超额完成了5月份计划。
    本报讯  广州市原来只有少数厂能在今年上半年完成全年跃进计划的50％，现在已经有绝大多数厂有信心完成或超额完成跃进计划了。这是在中共广州市委组织的红五月工业生产检查团，在检查全市工业生产系统在大跃进中出现的新的右倾保守思想后所取得的效果。
    广州市的工厂在整风运动中，订出了今年的生产跃进计划，职工们情绪高涨，生产节节上升，但是有相当一部分工厂的领导干部却开始满足于已有的成绩。前一时期，当许多厂普遍发生资金、厂房、设备、劳动力、原材料不足等困难时，厂的领导干部没有发动群众积极勇敢地去克服，而是等待上级出钱出力来解决。这种思想影响了生产的发展，当时有相当一部分工厂认为上半年无法完成全年跃进计划50％的指标。
    中共广州市委组织的检查团采取“务虚”和思想交锋的办法，克服领导干部的右倾保守思想。如中共南区委员会召开了全区厂长、党支部书记和少数工人参加的干部会议，对怎样搞好当前生产的问题进行鸣放辩论。全区厂房、设备最好的联光布厂产品质量很差，次布率达到5％，但是这个厂的领导干部却在鸣放会上说：领导上愿意跃进，但是工人和干部害怕跃进，因此质量提不高。条件比这个厂差得多的二联布厂的干部，在会上介绍了由于充分发动群众想办法，使次布率由10％降到0.13％，驳倒了联光厂领导干部的说法。经过辩论检查，联光厂的领导干部认为主要是领导上不深入发动群众、安于现状的右倾思想作怪，回厂后就立即发动群众想办法，结果工人们在几天内就提出了几十件合理化建议，现在次布率已经降到0.5％。开会前，全区一百一十九个厂中有60％的厂不能完成上半年计划，通过辩论，除少数限产的工厂外，绝大多数厂的领导写了保证书，表示有信心完成上半年的计划。
    缺乏厂房、设备、劳动力、原材料和资金，一定要上级给人给钱才能解决吗？不然。检查团发现有些厂缺少的物资设备，却是另一些厂所多余的东西，甚至一个厂内部也有这种情况。检查团就组织各单位相互调剂协作，使全市好几百家工厂和手工业社解决了困难。
    检查团同时深入各厂，发动群众献计，展开技术革新运动。如检查团在广华印染厂发动群众采取加宽印染布的花框等办法后，不但可以补足上个月的欠产数字，而且可以超额完成第二季度的生产任务。南区各工厂的职工发动起来后，在5月份提出了合理化建议三万多条，比今年头四个月的总数还多。有些合理化建议实行后，使得设备不好的工厂也生产出达到国内或国际先进水平的产品。
