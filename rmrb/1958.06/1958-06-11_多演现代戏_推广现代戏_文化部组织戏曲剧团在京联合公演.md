Buoyed by the great leap forward in socialist production, many opera troupes across the country have created and performed numerous opera works reflecting contemporary struggles, forming another upsurge in modern drama performances since the national liberation. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of opera workers, enrich the creation of modern dramas, consolidate and develop existing achievements, exchange experiences, and further improve the ideological and artistic level of opera performances depicting modern life, the Ministry of Culture has decided to hold a symposium on opera performances depicting modern life for approximately one month, starting from June 13th.

To facilitate the discussion and research of this symposium, the Ministry of Culture has organized the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe, Wuhan Chu Opera Troupe, Henan Yu Opera Institute's Third Troupe, Hunan Flower Drum Opera Troupe, Fujian Min Opera Experimental Troupe, as well as Beijing opera, Ping opera, and Qu opera units performing modern dramas, to hold a joint performance of opera with modern themes. Among them, the Chu Opera "Liu Jiumei", the Shanghai Operas "Mother" and "An Actor's Diary", the Yu Operas "Zhaoyang Gully" and "Liu Hulan", the Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan", the Min Opera "The Counselor", as well as the Beijing Opera and Ping Opera "The White Haired Girl", "Capturing Bandit Boss Vulture" and "Sanliwan" performed by some troupes in the capital, are all relatively excellent works depicting modern life and have been warmly welcomed by local audiences.
