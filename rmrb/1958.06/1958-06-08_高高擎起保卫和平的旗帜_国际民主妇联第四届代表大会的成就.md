　　Holding High the Banner of Defending Peace
　　——Achievements of the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation

    The Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation, held in Vienna, has successfully concluded after five days of meetings. Representatives from seventy-six countries participated in this congress. They held discussions on three topics: "Defending Life," "Conditions for Women to Fulfill Their Responsibilities as Mothers, Workers, and Citizens in Society," and "The Right to Educate and Nurture Children and Youth in the Spirit of Peace and Friendship Among All Peoples." They also telegraphed the President of the Security Council on behalf of the common aspirations of women and mothers worldwide, calling for efforts to stop nuclear weapons testing. Through this congress, women all over the world once again demonstrated their united strength in fighting to maintain peace, defend women's rights, and protect children's well-being.

    Since the World Women's Congress held in Copenhagen in 1953, the world situation has undergone profound changes and reached a new turning point. The imperialist camp headed by the United States is suffering the impact of a new and severe economic crisis, while the situation in the peace-loving socialist countries is thriving. The national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America continue to surge, and the movements of the people in capitalist countries such as France, Italy, Britain, and Japan to safeguard peace and strive for democracy are also developing more broadly. The Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing, the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, powerfully promoting the progress of the world peace movement. The launching of the three Soviet artificial satellites marked that the forces of peace and democracy have definitely surpassed the forces of imperialist war, further enhancing the confidence of the world's people in defending peace. All this shows that the current situation is favorable for the people of the world to achieve new victories in the struggle for peace, democracy, and national independence.

    However, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States stubbornly attempts to block the advance of the historical trend. U.S. imperialism continues to engage in war threats and preparations for new wars. Therefore, all peace-loving people must remain highly vigilant and continue to work tirelessly to maintain peace. In this situation, the peace appeal issued by the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation to the world in the name of mothers undoubtedly has enormous appeal and far-reaching significance.

    In the struggle to defend peace and oppose war, women are a great force. From the report of the General Secretary of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Madame Hertta Kuusinen, we are pleased to see that many women's organizations from other countries have recently joined the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the women of these countries were previously unorganized and had not participated in social life. This not only marks the further awakening of women in some countries and the further unity of women in the world, but also reflects the growth and strengthening of world peace forces. The Women's International Democratic Federation, based on the common aspirations of women of all countries, has carried out many beneficial works in playing the active role of women in defending peace. We believe that, after this congress, driven by the new situation, women all over the world will further strengthen unity and friendship and make greater contributions to world peace.

    "There can be no struggle for the rights and happiness of women and children without an effective struggle for peace and national independence." This sentence is very true. Chinese women deeply understand the correctness of this point from their own experience. Chinese women cherish the rights they have already gained and are working hard with the people of the whole country to build a liberated motherland. They therefore feel the preciousness of peace. Chinese women are willing to join women from all over the world in holding high the banner of defending peace and working together to ensure that mothers and children can always live in a world without fear. We believe that as long as all people who cherish peace work together, are vigilant against the conspiracies of war instigators, it is possible to stop the adventures of war maniacs under the current conditions and create the primary condition for the realization of women's rights and children's happiness—lasting world peace.

　　高高擎起保卫和平的旗帜
　　——国际民主妇联第四届代表大会的成就
    国际民主妇女联合会在维也纳举行的第四届代表大会，经过五天的会议以后，已经胜利闭幕。参加这届大会的有来自七十六个国家的代表。她们就“保卫生命”、“妇女在社会上执行母亲、劳动者和公民职责的条件”、“以和平和各国人民友好的精神来教育和培养儿童和青年的权利”等三个议题分别进行了讨论，并且代表全世界妇女和母亲们的共同愿望，打电报给安全理事会主席，呼吁设法制止核武器试验。通过这届大会，全世界妇女再一次显示了她们团结一致为维护和平、保卫妇女权利和儿童幸福而斗争的力量。
    自从1953年在哥本哈根召开世界妇女大会以来，世界局势已经发生了深刻的变化，并且达到了一个新的转折点。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，正在遭受新的严重的经济危机的冲击，而爱好和平的社会主义各国的情况却在蒸蒸日上。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动继续高涨，法国、意大利、英国、日本等资本主义国家人民维护和平、争取民主的运动也在更加广泛地开展。苏联单方面停止核武器试验的决定、苏联和东欧各人民民主国家的和平倡议、中国人民志愿军的从朝鲜撤退，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎，有力地促进了世界和平运动的进展。苏联三个人造卫星的上天，标志着和平民主力量肯定地超过了帝国主义战争势力，进一步增强了世界人民保卫和平的信心。这一切都说明：目前的形势有利于全世界人民在争取和平、民主和民族独立的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    但是，以美国为首的帝国主义集团却顽固地企图阻挡历史潮流的前进。美帝国主义还在继续进行战争威胁和准备新的战争。因此，一切爱好和平的人们仍须保持高度的警惕，继续不懈地为维护和平而斗争。在这种情况下，国际民主妇女联合会第四届代表大会以母亲名义向世界发出的和平呼吁，无疑地是有着巨大的感召力量和深远的意义的。
    在保卫和平、反对战争的斗争中，妇女是一支伟大的力量。从国际民主妇女联合会总书记桑蒂的报告中，我们高兴地看到：最近又有许多国家的妇女组织加入了国际民主妇女联合会，而这些国家的妇女以前是没有组织起来和没有参加过社会生活的。这不仅标志着某些国家妇女的进一步觉醒和世界妇女的进一步团结，而且也反映了世界和平力量的壮大和加强。国际民主妇女联合会根据各国妇女的共同愿望，在发挥妇女对保卫和平的积极作用方面，进行了许多有益的工作。我们相信，经过这次大会，在新形势的推动下，全世界的妇女将会更加加强团结和友谊，对世界和平作出更大的贡献。
    “没有争取和平和民族独立的有效斗争，就不可能争取到妇女和儿童的权利和幸福”，这句话说得很对。中国妇女从切身的经验中深深体会到这一点的正确。中国妇女珍视自己已经取得的权利，正在同全国人民一道，鼓足干劲，为建设解放了的祖国而进行努力，因此特别感到和平的可贵。中国妇女愿意同世界各国妇女一道，高高擎起保卫和平的旗帜，为使母亲和孩子能够永远生活在没有恐惧的世界里而共同奋斗。我们相信：只要一切珍视和平的人们共同努力，警惕战争挑拨者的阴谋，在目前的条件下，就有可能制止战争狂人的冒险，为实现妇女的权利和儿童的幸福创造出首要的条件——全世界的持久和平。
