Rare and Exotic Tropical Plants

Several rare and exotic tropical plants have been discovered in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan.

Ironwood that Can Replace Steel

Here, there is an ironwood tree that is harder than iron. This tree's texture is as hard as steel, and it can replace steel in certain machine parts. It is the hardest wood in the world. The oil yield of its seeds reaches 80%, making it the plant with the highest oil yield. According to a 50-year-old Dai elder from Manting Village, when he was a child, the tree was already as thick as a person could embrace, and it still looks as thick today.

Natural Oil Flows from the Tree Trunk

In Menglun and Mengpeng and other places in Xishuangbanna, there grows a type of oil tree. Its leaves are as large as palms, and its trunk has fine hairs. When a hole is dug in the trunk and lit with fire, oil flows out. Local Dai people use this natural oil for lamps. Monks use this oil on scriptures to prevent insect and ant damage. Some people also use this oil on sores on mules and horses, and the sores heal quickly. The scientific name of the oil tree is "Dryobalanops aromatica," and it belongs to the camphor family.

Rauvolfia serpentina, a Medicinal Material for Treating Hypertension

Three years ago, India produced a good medicine for treating hypertension called Serpina, which became a world treasure. The raw material for making Serpina is Rauvolfia serpentina. It is said that this tree is artificially planted in India, and after growing for three years, it is uprooted, and Serpina is extracted from its roots. However, in Menglun and other places in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Rauvolfia serpentina is a common wild plant. It grows among Eupatorium odoratum and other weeds, with oval leaves and small white flowers. Local Dai people call it "Masa Duan" and use it to feed horses. Last year, scientific researchers investigating biological resources in Yunnan discovered Rauvolfia serpentina. After testing by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, it was proven that the roots, stems, and leaves of this Rauvolfia serpentina contain effective components for extracting Serpina.

    珍奇的热带植物
    在云南西双版纳傣族自治州发现了几种珍奇的热带植物。
    可代钢铁的铁力木
    这里有一种比铁还硬的铁力木。这种树的质硬如钢，可以代替钢铁作机器上的某些部件，是世界上最硬的木材。结的籽出油率达80％，也是出油率最高的植物。据曼听寨一个五十多岁的傣族老人说，当他还是小孩时，这树就有一人合抱粗，现在看起来还是这么粗，
    树干里流出天然油
    在西双版纳的猛笼和猛捧等地，生长着一种油树，树叶大如手掌，树干上有茸毛。在树干上挖一个洞，用火一烧，便流出油来。当地傣族人用这种天然油点灯，和尚们把这种油涂在经书上，可以防止虫蛀和蚂蚁咬。还有人用这种油涂在骡马的疮口上，疮很快就好了。油树的学名叫“羯布罗香”，属于龙脑香料。
    治高血压药材萝芙木
    三年前印度制成一种治高血压症的良药，叫作寿比南，成为世界珍品，制成寿比南的原料就是萝芙木。据说：这种树在印度用人工种植，生长三年后连根拔起，用根部提炼寿比南。而在西双版纳傣族自治州猛笼等地，萝芙木是随处可见的野生植物，它生长在飞机草和其它野草丛中，叶椭圆，开白色小花，当地傣族人叫它做“麻萨端”，用来喂马。去年在云南考察生物资源的科学研究人员发现了萝芙木，又经上海药物研究部门化验，证明这种萝芙木根部以及茎和叶中，都含有提炼寿比南的有效成份。
