    Singing the General Line
    Six Hundred Million People on the General Line
    Ke Zhongping
    Six hundred million people on the General Line,
    Urging on warhorses to compete in speed,
    People have the heroic spirit of Communism,
    Horses have the four hooves of more, faster, better, and more economical,
    With one burst of energy,
    Running twenty-five thousand li;
    Whipping again and again,
    Leaving Britain and America behind.
    Chairman Mao, at sixty,
    Takes "Swimming the Yangtze River" as rest,
    When the East Wind completely overwhelms the West Wind,
    We will follow Chairman Mao,
    With a flick of the whip, flying to the Milky Way to swim.
    What Should You Do?
    Jin Yi
    What did you do during the First Five-Year Plan?
    What do you want to do during the Second Five-Year Plan?
    Comrades, ask yourselves this every day.
    Everyone is responsible for building a socialist motherland!
    Sunrise in the East
    Fang Ji
    The red sun rises in the East,
    Shining brilliantly in all directions,
    Looking from the Kunlun Mountains,
    The West is dark and the East is bright!
    Milestone
    Liang Shangquan
    A copy of the "Eighth National Congress" document—
    A milestone.
    Walking along its red line,
    Flying along its arrow,
    One day is worth twenty years,
    What is there to fear about a long road!
    One hundred and eight thousand li a day,
    Chasing straight after Britain!

    歌唱总路线
    总路线上人六亿
    柯仲平
    总路线上人六亿，
    催开战马比高低，
    人有共产主义英雄劲，
    马有多快好省四只蹄，
    一鼓劲，
    跑出二万五千里；
    加鞭再加鞭，
    把英国美国都抛在后边。
    毛主席，年六十，
    “万里长江横渡”当休息，
    东风完全压倒西风时，
    我们跟着毛主席，
    鞭一扬，飞上天河游泳去。
    你该干些什么？
    靳以
    第一个五年计划你干了些什么？
    第二个五年计划你想干些什么？
    同志，每天都要问自己。
    建设社会主义祖国人人有责！
    日出东方
    方纪
    东方升起红太阳，
    光芒万丈照四方，
    昆仑山上望一望，
    西方黑来东方亮！
    指路碑
    梁上泉
    一部“八大”文件——
    一座指路碑。
    沿着它的红线走，
    顺着它的箭头飞，
    一天就顶二十年，
    路远何足畏！
    一天十万八千里，
    直把英国追！
