Under the slogan of advancing while holding high the red flag of the General Line, young teachers and students at Tsinghua University are breaking down superstitions and creating boldly, raising the red flag of the proletariat's courage to think and act in many areas. Lai Jinyan, a fifth-year student in the Department of Civil Engineering, dared to create boldly in his graduation design by linking theory with practice. He modified the original design of a radio mast tower (a radio mast tower is a device used by radio stations as an antenna to transmit radio waves). This design can not only save a large amount of steel but also has good stability and is safe to operate. It has been praised by the design unit, and the Metal Structure Design Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has decided to use this design in the second batch of production this year.

Xie Xingjian and another student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, during their graduation internship at the Fengman Hydropower Plant, improved the plant's current plant-use system. After comparing eight possible existing plans, they proposed a new and practically significant improvement plan. This plan can save a set of power generation equipment worth more than 700,000 yuan, while the entire plan only requires an investment of 20,000 yuan. The factory has agreed to use this design.

Wu Guoqin and two other students from the Department of Hydraulic Engineering boldly designed a rockfill overflow dam while helping farmers with water conservancy in the countryside during this year's winter vacation. This type of dam has never existed in China, and cannot be found in foreign literature either. Now, this dam is under construction.

Lu Daquan and two other young teachers and three graduate students from the Television Teaching and Research Group broke down their blind faith in bourgeois authorities and broke through the obstruction of right-wing elements such as Qian Weichang. After diligently studying and working hard, they opened three television courses that had never existed in China, guided twenty-five students in their specialized television graduation designs, established a laboratory, and produced a complete set of television system equipment.

Hua Rongnian, a student in the Department of Power Engineering, improved the cylinder head of a gas cylinder during an internship in Tianjin. Each gas cylinder can increase by four horsepower and save 900 yuan. If this measure is implemented throughout Tianjin, it can save 20,000 taels of gold.

These creative inventions of young teachers and students have been supported by the Party and assisted by workers. At the same time, because they dared to think boldly, create boldly, break down superstitions, break through all backward conservatism, link theory with practice, and study and work diligently, they have set an example for all teachers and students in the school. Everyone has expressed that they want to learn from them and become "good teachers" and "good students" of a socialist university who are both knowledgeable in scientific theory and able to solve practical problems, and who have the spirit of daring to think and create independently.

　　青出于蓝而胜于蓝
    清华大学青年教师和学生树立敢想敢干新风格
    本报讯  在高举总路线的红旗前进的口号下，清华大学青年教师和学生破除迷信，大胆创造，许多地方树立起无产阶级敢想敢干的红旗。土木系五年级学生来晋炎，在毕业设计中，由于联系实际，敢于大胆创造，修改了无线电桅杆塔原设计（无线电桅杆塔是广播电台当作天线，发送电波用的设备），这项设计不仅可以节省大量钢材，而且稳定性好，操作安全，受到了设计单位的好评，建筑工程部金属结构设计局决定在今年第二批生产时使用这一设计。
    电机系学生谢行健等二人在丰满水电厂毕业实习时，对该厂目前的厂用系统加以改进，在比较了已有八个可能方案后，提出了具有现实意义的新的改进方案，这个方案可以节约一套价值七十多万元的发电设备，而整个方案只要投资二万元。这项设计厂方已同意使用。
    水利系学生吴国钦等三人在今年寒假下乡帮助农民搞水利化时，大胆地设计了一个堆石滚水坝。这种坝中国从没有过，外国的文献中也找不到。现在，这个水坝已施工。
    电视教研组陆大?等三位青年教师和三位研究生，破除了对资产阶级权威的迷信，冲破了钱伟长等右派分子的阻挠，经过了苦钻实干，开出了三门中国从未有过的电视课程，指导了二十五个学生的电视专门化毕业设计，建立了实验室，并制成一套电视系统设备。
    动力系学生华茸年在天津实习时改进了煤气缸的缸盖，每台煤气缸可以增加四匹马力，节约九百元，如果这项措施在全天津实现，就可以节约黄金两万两。
    这些青年教师和学生的创造发明，由于得到了党的支持和工人同志的帮助，同时由于他们敢于大胆的想，大胆的创造，破除迷信，冲破一切落后保守，联系实际，苦钻实干，已经为全校师生树立了一面红旗。大家纷纷表示要向他们学习，成为既通晓科学理论又能解决实际问题，并具有敢想敢独创精神的社会主义大学的“好教师”和“好学生”。（附图片）
