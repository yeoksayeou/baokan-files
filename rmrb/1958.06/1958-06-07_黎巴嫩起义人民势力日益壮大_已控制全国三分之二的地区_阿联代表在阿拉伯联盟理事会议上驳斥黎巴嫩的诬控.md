Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, June 6th: Lebanese southern insurgent leader Asad told the Syrian News Agency that Lebanese insurgent forces have controlled two-thirds of the country.

Asad said that in southern Lebanon, the insurgents have already controlled the cities of Sidon, Tyre, Aqiya, Bint Jbeil, Marjayoun, and Hasbaya.

In the north, the Lebanese government can only exercise power in individual regions. In central Lebanon, apart from Zahlé, the insurgents have almost taken control of the entire Bekaa Valley.

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Lebanese People's Army used American anti-tank rocket launchers in the battle with government forces in Beirut on the 4th. These weapons were seized from government forces.

According to newspaper reports, Jordanian troops have landed in Beirut port on the 5th at the request of the Chamoun government.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 6th: According to Cairo newspapers on the 5th, Said Fahmy, head of the United Arab Republic delegation attending the special meeting of the Arab League Council, pointed out in his speech at the meeting on the evening of the 3rd that the real reason for the Lebanese government's "accusation" against the United Arab Republic was merely to create grounds for foreign interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Such interference is detrimental to Arab nationalism and violates international law and international practice.

Fahmy emphasized that the current events in Lebanon are a national movement of the Lebanese people. He said that the Lebanese problem is entirely an internal matter.

Fahmy also talked about the Lebanese government fabricating and broadcasting news hostile to the United Arab Republic. He said that Lebanon has become a base for conspirators against the United Arab Republic.

He finally reiterated that the United Arab Republic will respect Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.

    黎巴嫩起义人民势力日益壮大
    已控制全国三分之二的地区
    阿联代表在阿拉伯联盟理事会议上驳斥黎巴嫩的诬控
    据新华社大马士革6日电　黎巴嫩南部起义人民领袖阿萨德对叙利亚通讯社发表谈话说，黎巴嫩起义人民已经控制了全国三分之二的地区。
    阿萨德说，在黎巴嫩南方，起义人民已经控制了赛伊达、特尔、阿克吉亚、宾特山城、迈尔杰乌荣和哈斯贝亚等城市。
    在北部，黎巴嫩政府只能在个别地区行使政权。在黎巴嫩中部，除了扎赫莱以外，起义人民差不多控制了整个贝卡盆地。
    据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩人民军4日在贝鲁特同政府部队进行的战斗中使用了美国的反战车火箭炮，这些炮是从政府部队手中缴获来的。
    据报纸报道，约旦军队应夏蒙政府的要求已经在5日在贝鲁特港登陆。
    据新华社开罗6日电　据开罗报纸5日报道，参加阿拉伯联盟理事会特别会议的阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团长赛义德·法米在3日晚间举行的会议上发言时指出，黎巴嫩政府对阿拉伯联合共和国提出“控诉”的真正原因仅仅是为了要给外国干涉黎巴嫩内政制造理由，这种干涉有害于阿拉伯民族主义，并且违反国际法和国际惯例。
    法米着重指出，黎巴嫩目前的事件是黎巴嫩人民的民族运动。他说，黎巴嫩问题完全是内部问题。
    法米还谈到黎巴嫩政府捏造并且广播敌视阿拉伯联合共和国的消息。他说，黎巴嫩变成了反对阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋分子的大本营。
    他最后重申，阿拉伯联合共和国将尊重黎巴嫩的独立和主权。
