    Fitter Zhang Bingli and Wang Wenyu Boldly Innovate
    Work Efficiency Leaps More Than 28,000 Times

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 23rd dispatch) Reporter Li Qian reports: Xi'an youth fitters Zhang Bingli and Wang Wenyu boldly imagined and painstakingly researched, and successfully experimented with using a punch press to replace manual production of "magnetic field slotting tool punch head" for electric motors, increasing production efficiency by a staggering 28,800 times.

    Zhang Bingli and Wang Wenyu are both fitters in the tool group of the Xi'an Joint State-Private Zhongxing Electric Motor Factory. In the past, they relied entirely on manual operation to produce punch tools for punching motor rotor and stator slots, and production efficiency was very low; a senior fitter could only file one out in twelve hours. This year, the factory is producing electric motors in large quantities, and the supply of punch tools cannot meet the demand. How to improve the production efficiency of this tool became a key problem in production. Young workers Zhang Bingli, Wang Wenyu, and Shen Mincai, young technician Deng Mingqing, and veteran worker Hu Songmin, etc., formed a technical innovation group to study and solve this problem in their spare time. Zhang Bingli first came up with the idea of heating the blank and then using a punch press to replace manual processing. In this way, producing a punch tool only takes 22.5 seconds, increasing production efficiency by thousands of times compared to manual operation. Then, Wang Wenyu, a 22-year-old young fitter, proposed changing hot punching to cold punching. This suggestion received enthusiastic support and help from Zhang Bingli. Together, they consulted with Zhu Xingkuan, an eighth-grade veteran technician, and also received technical assistance. After three or four sleepless nights of experimentation, they finally successfully experimented with the method of cold punching punch tools. Using this method to produce a punch tool only takes 1.5 seconds, increasing efficiency more than 28,000 times compared to manual operation, and more than nine times compared to the hot punching method.

    The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote letters to the technical innovation group headed by Zhang Bingli and Wang Wenyu, congratulating them on their achievements in the technical innovation movement and encouraging them to continue their efforts to achieve greater achievements. The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also awarded Zhang Bingli and Wang Wenyu the honorary title of Xi'an Youth Technical Innovation Shock Workers and called on all young workers in the city to learn from them.

### 钳工张秉礼和王文煜大胆革新  工作效率猛跃二万八千多倍

    钳工张秉礼和王文煜大胆革新
    工作效率猛跃二万八千多倍
    本报西安23日电  记者李茜报道：西安市青年钳工张秉礼和王文煜大胆设想，刻苦钻研，试验用冲床代替手工生产电动机“磁场冲槽工具冲头”成功，使生产效率猛跃到二万八千八百倍。
    张秉礼和王文煜都是西安市公私合营中兴电机制造厂工具组的钳工。过去他们完全靠手工操作生产冲电动机转子和定子线槽的冲头工具，生产效率非常低，一个高级钳工十二小时才能锉出一个。今年工厂大批生产电动机，冲头工具供不应求。如何提高这种工具的生产效率，就成了生产中的关键问题。青年工人张秉礼、王文煜、沈民才，青年技术员邓名清和老师傅胡松民等五人，自动成立了技术革新小组，在业余时间来研究解决这个问题。张秉礼首先想出了把毛坯加热以后，用冲床代替手工加工的办法。这样生产一个冲头工具，只用二十二点五秒钟，比用手工操作生产效率提高一千几百倍。接着，二十二岁的青年钳工王文煜又提出了改热冲为冷冲的建议。这个建议得到了张秉礼的热情支持和帮助。他们又一起请教了八级老技工朱兴宽，也得到了技术上的帮助。他们经过三、四个不眠的夜晚的试验，终于试验成功冷冲冲头工具的办法。用这个办法生产一个冲头工具，只要一点五秒钟，比用手工操作效率提高二万八千多倍，比用热冲的办法提高工效九倍多。
    中共西安市委和陕西省工会联合会分别写信给以张秉礼、王文煜为首的技术革新小组，祝贺他们在技术革新运动中的成就，鼓励他们继续努力，争取获得更大的成就。共青团西安市委也授予张秉礼和王文煜以西安市青年技术革新突击手的光荣称号，并号召全市青年职工向他们学习。
