Rapeseed Yields Can Increase Rapidly
This Year's Summer Harvest of Rapeseed Increased by 60% Compared to Last Year
National Highest Yield Record Reached 806 Jin Per Mu

(Our Newspaper) Buoyed by the Great Leap Forward, and through the efforts of the vast number of farmers throughout winter and spring, rapeseed has achieved a bumper harvest across the country. The summer harvest of rapeseed nationwide is now basically complete. According to recent estimates by the agricultural departments, the total national summer harvest of rapeseed can be increased by about 60% compared to last year's summer harvest of rapeseed. Hubei, Anhui, and Henan provinces have more than doubled their production this year compared to last year; Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangdong provinces have more than doubled their production; the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has increased production by more than 80%; and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Shaanxi provinces have also increased production by 20% to 40%.

Amidst the universal bumper harvest of rapeseed, many large-area high-yield models and high-yield models have emerged in various places. This year, eleven counties in Hunan Province, including Xupu, Qidong, Lingling, Chenxi, Qianyang, Huitong, Dayong, Shaodong, Dongkou, Shuangfeng, and Xinshao, have all averaged over 100 jin per mu. Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces have also seen some counties producing over 100 jin of rapeseed this year. Although Sichuan Province experienced significant natural disasters last winter and this spring, the average yield per unit area in the province can still reach about 100 jin. Xinghua County in Jiangsu Province, the rapeseed yield champion last year, is expected to have an average yield of about 250 jin per mu this year, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. Rapeseed in Songzi County, Hubei Province, is also growing particularly well this year, with an expected average yield of about 150 jin per mu throughout the county. Among them, more than 33,000 mu of "Victory Rapeseed" have an average yield of over 270 jin per mu. The Baishuitang Agricultural Cooperative in Dakou Township of this county, due to planting mostly "Victory Rapeseed" improved varieties, is expected to have a yield of 300 jin per mu on all 440 mu of rapeseed, with some reaching 702 jin. The 1.36 million mu of rapeseed in Wuhu Special District, Anhui, is expected to yield 110 jin per mu, an increase of 134% compared to last year. Zeng Kaicai, a special-class labor model in Yingcheng County, Hubei, harvested 2,418 jin of rapeseed from his three mu of experimental fields, averaging 806 jin per mu, setting the national record for highest rapeseed yield.

The strong leadership of party committees at all levels is an important factor in this year's bumper rapeseed harvest. The First Secretaries of the Hubei and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committees personally deployed and inspected this production. It is even more common for the secretaries of prefectural and county party committees to personally lead this production, and promptly solve problems in production. In order to enrich their experience in this area, many leading comrades in rapeseed producing areas also cultivated rapeseed experimental fields.

Improving rapeseed cultivation techniques has also contributed significantly to this year's rapeseed bumper harvest. Field management of rapeseed was universally strengthened last winter and this spring. Rapeseed fields in all provinces have been fertilized and weeded one to two times more than in previous years. Zunyi Special District, the main rapeseed producing area in Guizhou, carried out four topdressings of fertilizer and weeding for rapeseed, creating favorable conditions for rapeseed growth and development. Rapeseed in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan generally changed from broadcasting to dibbling. Some areas in this province with sparse planting habits have also changed from sparse to dense. Some cultivation techniques have spread very quickly through on-site meetings. After the Xinghua Rapeseed Promotion Conference, many producing areas paid attention to the experience of applying more topdressing fertilizer during the flowering period and expanded the area of flower fertilizer application.

Many facts show that this year's rapeseed harvest was wrested from nature by the people. The severe drought in southwestern China and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River last year brought great difficulties to the sowing of rapeseed; last winter and this spring, many rapeseed producing areas suffered more than three frosts; during the rapeseed harvest season, many areas encountered rainy and harsh weather. Thanks to the indomitable fighting spirit of the vast number of cadres and masses inspired by the rectification campaign and socialist education, the constantly emerging natural disasters have been overcome one by one. Many agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province started with drought-resistant sowing and continuously fought natural disasters for several months, until the harvest they also fought a great battle with cloudy and rainy weather. Some areas in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan and other provinces that experienced rapeseed pests and diseases, on the one hand fought against drought, floods, and frost, and on the other hand, promptly prevented and controlled serious pests and diseases.

The high-yield materials emerging from various places prove that rapeseed has great potential for increased production, and there is much to be gained from increasing the yield per unit area of rapeseed. Many local leaders are confidently and actively arranging the next year's rapeseed sowing work. Hubei Province has initially decided to expand the rapeseed sowing area to 5 million mu this winter, and has also made arrangements for seeds and fertilizers. For a greater rapeseed harvest next year, each agricultural cooperative in Xinghua County, Jiangsu, universally carried out seed selection and retention work, and planned in advance that the winter sowing area of rapeseed this year would be 200,000 mu, four times larger than the autumn sowing area last year. Hukou, a hundred-jin rapeseed county in Jiangxi, planned an average yield of 150 jin next year, striving to reach 200 jin.

Due to this year's rapeseed harvest, many oil-deficient areas in the past have achieved self-sufficiency and surplus in oil this year. Fuzhou Special District in Jiangxi Province, originally an oil-deficient area, planned to achieve self-sufficiency with surplus by 1960. As a result, after this year's rapeseed harvest, it achieved the three-year plan in one year, and could also transfer some oil to support other places. Hukou County in this province achieved "one hundred-jin rapeseed county" this year. After a bumper harvest, the county, in addition to completing the state-allocated unified purchase task, further improved the people's edible oil level throughout the county according to the policy of "more production, more gain, more increase, more retention."

    油菜产量能迅速增长
    今年夏收菜子比去年增产六成
    全国最高丰产纪录已达亩产806斤
    本报讯　在大跃进形势鼓舞下，经过广大农民一冬一春的斗争努力，各地油菜普遍丰收了。现在全国的夏收油菜，已基本收割完毕，据农业部门最近预计，全国夏收菜子总产量可比去年夏收菜子总产量增产60％左右。湖北、安徽、河南三省今年比去年增产一倍半以上，湖南、江西、贵州、广东四省增产一倍以上，广西僮族自治区增产80％以上，江苏、浙江、云南和陕西等省也增产二至四成。
    在油菜普遍大丰收中，各地涌现出许多大面积丰产典型和高额丰产典型。湖南省溆浦、祁东、零陵、辰溪、黔阳、会同、大庸、邵东、洞口、双峰、新邵等十一个县今年都平均亩产一百斤以上。湖北、安徽、江西、陕西等省，今年也出现了一些百斤菜子县。四川省去冬今春虽然有较大的自然灾害，但是全省平均单位产量，仍能达到百斤左右。去年的油菜丰产冠军江苏省兴化县，今年预计平均亩产达二百五十斤左右，比去年增产三成以上。湖北省松滋县的油菜，今年也长的特别好，全县预计亩产一百五十斤左右。其中有三万三千多亩“胜利油菜”，平均亩产达二百七十多斤。这个县的大路口乡白水淌农业社，由于大部种了“胜利油菜”良种，全社四百四十多亩油菜，预计亩产达三百斤，高的达七百零二斤。安徽芜湖专区的一百三十六万亩油菜，预计亩产一百一十斤，比去年增产134％。湖北应城县特等劳动模范曾开彩种的三亩试验田油菜，实收菜子二千四百一十八斤，平均亩产八百零六斤，创造了全国最高的油菜丰产纪录。
    各级党委的坚强领导，是今年油菜大丰收的重要因素。湖北、江西省委第一书记都亲自部署和检查了这项生产。地委书记、县委书记亲自领导这项生产，及时解决生产中的问题，更是普遍情况。不少油菜产区的领导同志，为了丰富这一方面的经验，还培育了油菜试验田。
    改进油菜栽培技术为今年的油菜丰产也出力不小。去冬今春的油菜田间管理普遍加强了。各省的油菜田，都比往年多了一到二次的施肥和除草。贵州主要油菜产地遵义专区，先后对油菜进行四次追肥、除草，给油菜的生长发育创造了良好条件。湖南洞庭湖地区的油菜，普遍改撒播为点播。这个省一些有稀植习惯的地区，也都改稀为密了。有些栽培技术，通过现场会议传播得非常迅速。在兴化油菜促进会议以后，许多产区都重视了多施花期追肥的经验，扩大了追花肥的面积。
    许多事实表明，今年油菜的丰收是人们向自然夺取来的。去年西南地区和长江中游严重的干旱为播种油菜带来很大的困难；去冬今春，许多油菜产区受到三次以上的霜冻；在油菜收获季节里，许多地区又赶上多雨的恶劣气候。由于整风和社会主义教育所鼓舞起来的广大干部和群众顽强的斗争精神，不断出现的自然灾害都被一个一个战胜了。安徽省许多农业社由抗旱播种开始，连续和自然灾害斗争了几个月，直到收获还和阴雨大战了一场。浙江、江苏、安徽、四川等省的一些发生油菜病虫的地区，一方面向旱、涝、霜冻斗争，一方面及时防治了为害严重的病虫。
    从各地涌现出来的丰产材料证明，油菜增产潜力很大，提高油菜单位面积产量大有可为。许多地方的领导，正在满怀信心地积极布置下一年油菜播种工作。湖北省已初步决定将今冬油菜播种面积扩大到五百万亩，同时，并做了种子与肥料等安排。江苏兴化县各农业社为了来年油菜更大的丰收，普遍进行了选留种子工作，提前规划了今年冬播油菜的面积为二十万亩，比去年的秋播面积扩大四倍。江西百斤菜子县湖口，计划了明年的平均产量为一百五十斤，争取达到二百斤。
    由于今年油菜丰收，许多过去缺油地区，今年都做到了油料自给和有余。江西省抚州专区，原来为缺油区，规划到1960年达到自给有余，结果今年菜子丰收后，一年就实现了三年的规划，还能有一部分油脂调出支援别地。这个省湖口县今年实现了“油菜百斤县”，获得大丰收后，全县除完成国家分配的统购任务外，还根据“多产多得、增产多留”的政策，进一步提高全县人民的食油水平。（附图片）
