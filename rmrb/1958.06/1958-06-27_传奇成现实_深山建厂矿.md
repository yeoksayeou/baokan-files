Construction Blossoms

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 26th: A local industrial system serving agricultural production in mountainous areas is being established in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    Before liberation, there were no factories or mines in the Autonomous Prefecture. The Tujia, Miao, and Han farmers, who lived in the deep mountains, spoke of factories and mines as mythical legends.

    Now, a relatively large agricultural machinery factory and a bacterial fertilizer factory have been established in Jishou, the capital of the Autonomous Prefecture. On the phosphorus mines spanning hundreds of kilometers in the northeast of the Autonomous Prefecture, a superphosphate factory with an annual output of 3,000 tons is being built. In the eight iron ore producing areas of Sangzhi, Longshan, Huayuan, and others, more than 200 small iron smelting furnaces and small blast furnaces are being built. In Yongshun, Longshan, Baojing, Guzhang, and other famous tung oil producing areas, more than 100 oil presses, five Hong oil manufacturing plants with an annual output of more than 4 million catties, and 30 wild essential oil processing plants have also been established. According to the dispersed characteristics of mountain villages, 70 small mobile rice mills will also be established to process grain for farmers of all ethnic groups in various mountain villages regularly. With the establishment of a large number of factories and mines, many power plants have also been built. This year, the entire prefecture will build 96 small hydropower stations and 300 biogas power stations. In five years, this remote mountainous area will be electrified.

    传奇成现实　深山建厂矿
    据新华社长沙26日电　湘西土家族苗族自治州正在建立一个为山区农业生产服务的地方工业体系。
    解放前，自治州没有一个厂矿，聚居在深山里的土家、苗、汉各族农民把厂矿说成神话般的传奇。
    现在，在自治州首府——吉首已经建立了规模较大的农业机械厂和细菌肥料厂。在自治州东北部绵延数百公里的磷矿山上，正在建立一座年产三千吨的过磷酸钙厂。在桑植、龙山、花垣等八个铁矿产区，正在建立二百多座小炼铁炉和小高炉。在著名的桐油产区——永顺、龙山、保靖、古丈等地，亦建立起一百多座榨油厂、五座年产四百多万斤的洪油制造厂和三十座野生香精油料加工厂。根据山寨分散的特点，还将建立七十个小型的流动碾米厂，经常到各山寨为各族农民加工粮食。随着大批厂矿的设立，许多动力工厂也建立起来了。今年，全州要兴建九十六座小型水力发电站和三百处沼气发电站。五年后，这个偏僻的大山区将实现电气化。
