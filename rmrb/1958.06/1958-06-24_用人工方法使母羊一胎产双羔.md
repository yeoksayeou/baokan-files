    Using Artificial Methods to Induce Ewes to Give Birth to Twin Lambs
    The method of using artificial means to make sheep produce more twin and triplet lambs has been successfully tested at the Aohan Banner Sheep Farm in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is a major innovation in the great leap forward in China's animal husbandry production. It breaks the superstitious idea held by some that "animal husbandry cannot leap forward as quickly as other production."
    The method created by the Aohan Banner Sheep Farm to make sheep produce more lambs is: injecting pregnant mare serum into ewes. Last year, the sheep farm workers injected 1,961 ewes with this method, and recently more than 2,500 lambs have been born, including more than 530 twins and 8 triplets, reaching a peak reproduction rate of 127.7%.
    The practice of injecting pregnant mare serum into ewes to increase the lambing rate has been continuously tested in this sheep farm for three years. Practice has proved that both crossbred sheep and local sheep can use this method to increase the lambing rate. For the past three years, they have used non-twin-bearing estrous ewes and healthy mares that have been pregnant for forty to one hundred and twenty days for experiments. The injection time is three to four days before the ewe's estrus, and the injection is subcutaneous in the back leg of the sheep, injecting twelve to fifteen cc per sheep, and artificial insemination is performed five to six days after the injection.

    用人工方法使母羊一胎产双羔
    用人工方法让绵羊多产双羔和三羔，这个办法已在内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟敖汉旗羊场试验成功。这是我国畜牧业生产大跃进中的一项重大创举。它打破了有些人认为“畜牧业不能像其它生产一样迅速跃进”的迷信思想。
    敖汉旗羊场创造使绵羊多产羔的办法是：用妊娠马血清给母绵羊注射。去年羊场职工们用这种办法注射的一千九百六十一只母羊，最近已产下羊羔二千五百多只，其中双胎的五百三十多只，三胎的八只，繁殖率达到127.7％的高峰。
    给母绵羊注射妊娠马血清来提高产羔率，在这座羊场里曾经连续试验了三年。实践证明：不论杂种羊或是本地羊，都可以采用这种办法提高产羔率。他们三年来都是采用历年不怀双胎的发情母羊同妊娠已四十天到一百二十天的健康母马做试验。注射时间是在母羊发情前三天到四天，在羊的后腿里皮下注射，每只羊注射十二到十五西西，注射后五天到六天进行人工授精。
