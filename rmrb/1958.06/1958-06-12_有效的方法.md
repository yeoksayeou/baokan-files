    Effective Methods
    Xiao Min
    Our country's socialist construction has entered a new stage of technological and cultural revolution. The Party's call has been enthusiastically responded to by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. In the countryside, the vast number of peasants are enthusiastically advancing towards culture, studying agricultural techniques, and reforming production tools. This is the beginning of a great march to conquer technological and cultural backwardness. The enthusiasm of the masses is extremely valuable. However, in the advance towards the technological and cultural revolution, the enthusiasm of the vast masses alone is not enough; it also requires strong leading cadres to appropriately organize the enthusiasm of the masses. Otherwise, the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustainable nor move in the right direction or improve further. The vast number of grassroots cadres should play this backbone role in the technological and cultural revolution, because they themselves must first engage in learning. In this way, grassroots cadres can not only be among the masses, but also lead and organize the masses to advance towards technology and culture. During the socialist Great Leap Forward, many grassroots cadres have already become "native experts" and outstanding cultural warriors. With the situation developing rapidly, grassroots cadres feel the importance of learning even more urgently. When analyzing the reasons for establishing the Red and Expert School, San Guanmiao Township in Dengfeng County stated that it was "the Party's call, the needs of the situation, and the demands of the cadres." All localities should recognize the desire of grassroots cadres to learn and organize their learning well.
    Recently, Henan Province has vigorously established Red and Expert Schools, providing a good example for solving the learning problems of grassroots cadres. As local cadres said, Red and Expert Schools "are the best way for grassroots cadres to persist in systematic political and theoretical study for a long time, and are a feasible way for grassroots cadres to gradually become both red and expert."
    Red and Expert Schools are a good form of combining politics and technology, theory and practice. This combination is clearly reflected in the learning content. They study language, political theory, agricultural technology, and plant experimental fields. Their learning has completely broken away from dogmatic learning, and learning and doing are combined. For example, the agricultural technology course at the San Guanmiao Township Red and Expert School focuses on issues that urgently need to be resolved in current agricultural production. This year, they will learn advanced experiences in the production process of various major crops, learn advanced methods of fertilizer production, and understand the chemical composition and uses of various fertilizers, and immediately apply what they have learned in the experimental fields. The requirements for their collectively cultivated experimental fields are: grain crops should achieve a yield of 2,500 jin per mu, cotton should achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and sweet potatoes should achieve a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. Their experimental fields have become a guidance station for agricultural production technology.
    Red and Expert Schools are also a relatively reliable and effective method for improving grassroots cadres. Generally speaking, grassroots cadres are relatively busy with work, live in dispersed areas, and have high mobility. In the past, literacy campaigns and political theory studies for cadres in various places were often in a state of self-flow and intermittent. Now that there are Red and Expert Schools, their learning time is relatively fixed and concentrated, the learning content has a certain plan, and the learning methods are also more flexible, combining classes and self-study. As long as they persist for a long time, grassroots cadres can gradually learn more systematic basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and cultural and scientific knowledge. Undoubtedly, this is an effective method for improving on-the-job cadres, and this is an important step in realizing the technological and cultural revolution.

    有效的方法
    萧敏
    我国的社会主义建设已经进入了技术革命和文化革命的新阶段。党的这个号召已经得到工人、农民、知识分子的热烈响应。在农村里，广大农民向文化进军、研究农业技术、改革生产工具之风热火朝天。这是征服技术落后和文化落后伟大进军的开端。群众的热情是极为可贵的。但是，在向技术革命、文化革命的进军中，只有广大群众的积极性是不够的，还需要有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，不然，群众的积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和再提高。广大基层干部在技术革命、文化革命中就应当起这种骨干作用，因为他们自己必须首先进行学习。这样，才能使基层干部不仅置身于群众之中，而且能领导组织群众向技术、文化进军。在社会主义大跃进中，已经有不少基层干部当上了“土专家”，当上了出色的文化战士。形势发展一日千里，基层干部更加迫切感觉到学习的重要。登封县三官庙乡分析他们创办红专学校的原因时就说到，这是“党的号召，形势需要，干部要求。”各地应当看到基层干部这种学习的愿望，很好地组织他们学习。
    最近，河南省大力创办红专学校，为解决基层干部的学习提供了很好的榜样。正如当地干部所说，红专学校“是基层干部长期坚持系统的政治理论学习的最好形式，是基层干部逐步达到又红又专的可行途径。”
    红专学校是政治与技术、理论和实践相结合的一种好形式。这种结合在学习内容上明显地体现出来。他们学习语文、政治理论、农业技术并种了试验田。他们的学习已经完全摆脱教条式的学习，学和做结合起来了。例如三官庙乡红专学校的农业技术课，内容是当前农业生产中迫切需要解决的问题，他们今年要学会各种主要农作物生产过程的先进经验，学会先进的造肥方法，了解各种肥料所含的化学成分和用途，学了马上就在试验田中运用。他们集体种的试验田的要求是：粮食作物的产量达到亩产二千五百斤，棉花亩产皮棉一百斤，红薯亩产一万斤。他们的试验田已经成为农业生产技术的指导站。
    红专学校也是提高基层干部的比较可靠和有效的方法。一般地说，基层干部工作比较繁忙，住得分散，流动性又大。过去，各地扫除文盲和干部政治理论学习，经常处于自流和时停时续的状态。现在有了红专学校，他们的学习时间比较固定、集中，学习内容有一定的计划，学习方法也比较灵活，上课和自修相互结合，只要长期坚持下去，基层干部就可以循序渐进，学到比较系统的马列主义基础知识和文化科学知识。无疑的，这是提高在职干部的有效方法，这是实现技术革命和文化革命的重要的一步。
