    Marx and Hegel
    Qiu Yin's article "Despise 'Great Men' Accordingly," published on page eight on May 29th, is essentially a good article. However, the statement in the article that Marx "despised" Hegel as a "'dead dog'" contradicts the views expressed by Marx in the postscript to the second edition of the first volume of "Das Kapital." Marx said: "Nearly thirty years ago, when Hegelian dialectics were still very popular, I criticized the mystical aspects of Hegelian dialectics. But when I wrote the first volume of "Das Kapital," the rampant, conceited, mediocre warriors, who are still bragging in German intellectual circles today, treated Hegel like Lessing's daring Moses Mendelssohn treated Spinoza, regarding him as a 'dead dog.' Therefore, I openly admit that I am a follower of this great thinker." From this passage, it is completely clear that it was those conceited and ignorant braggarts who despised Hegel as a "dead dog," and Marx deeply loathed them. How can it be said that Marx despised Hegel as a "dead dog"?

    马克思和黑格尔
    5月29日八版上丘引同志写的
  “见‘大人’则藐之”，基本上是一篇好文章。但是文中关于马克思“对黑格尔则‘藐之’为‘死狗’”的说法，是与马克思在“资本论”第一卷第二版所写的跋中所表述的观点相抵触的。马克思说：“在黑格尔辩证法仍甚流行的将近三十年前，我已批评过黑格尔辩证法的神秘的方面。但我著作资本论第一卷时，猖狂的，自负的，平庸的，今天还在德意志知识界吹牛的战士们，却已像勒新时代大胆的摩塞·门德尔桑对待斯宾诺莎一样，对待黑格尔，把他看作是一条‘死狗’了。因此，我倒公然承认我是这位大思想家的门人。”从这一段话中完全可以看出，把黑格尔藐之为“死狗”的，是当时那些自负的不学无术的吹牛家们，马克思对他们是深恶痛绝的。怎能说马克思把黑格尔藐之为“死狗”呢？
