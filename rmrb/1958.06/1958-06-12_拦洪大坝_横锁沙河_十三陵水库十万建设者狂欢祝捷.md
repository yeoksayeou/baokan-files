　　Flood Control Dam Firmly Locks the Sha River
　　100,000 Builders at the Ming Tombs Reservoir Celebrate Victory

　　(Our dispatch) After 140 days and nights of intense labor, the builders of the Ming Tombs Reservoir were all excited and jubilant yesterday, celebrating the successful completion of the earthwork for the reservoir's main structure – the flood control dam – before the arrival of the flood season.

　　Now, this flood control dam, towering between the Mangshan and Hanbao mountains of the Ming Tombs, has tightly locked the Sha River tributary of the Wenyu River, which has caused trouble for many years. This Ming Tombs Reservoir, lying like a mandarin fish on the northern outskirts of the capital, can hold back floods from a drainage area of more than 200 square kilometers, store 60 million cubic meters of water, and irrigate more than 250,000 mu of land.

　　The celebration rally, attended by 100,000 people, began at 3 p.m. After General Luo Wenfang, the general commander of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Construction Headquarters, delivered the opening speech, Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council; General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power; Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education; General Yang Chengwu, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Garrison in Beijing; Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others spoke successively.

　　Yesterday, the entire reservoir construction site presented an unusual scene. Everywhere was a sea of people and red flags fluttering. The five characters "Ming Tombs Reservoir" written by Chairman Mao were affixed to the front of the flood control dam.

　　Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, extended congratulations to the reservoir builders on behalf of the State Council. Qi Yanming said that under the care and leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, all the builders had completed the main project of the reservoir. The People's Liberation Army is a victorious army in war and a production expert in construction. A considerable number of government officials, students, and other intellectuals had little or no experience in manual labor. This time, they participated in the construction of the reservoir together with the masses, receiving good training and education from labor. Many international friends and foreign experts also contributed their labor to the reservoir, and we express our gratitude to them.

　　Generals Gan Siqi and Yang Chengwu encouraged all the builders to be determined to fight to the end and build the entire reservoir project beautifully.

　　Wan Li, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, extended warm congratulations to all the reservoir builders on behalf of the Municipal Committee. He said: The people of the capital regard the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site as a communist university. Today's victory is the victory of the entire capital. He called on everyone to make persistent efforts and completely fulfill all construction tasks of the reservoir.

　　After the commanders of each section and team of the construction site reported their achievements to the conference, and the Deputy General Commander of the construction site announced the end of the fourth award evaluation, the members of the chorus sang the new work "Moving Mountains and Reclaiming Seas" composed by musicians to praise the Ming Tombs Reservoir.

　　The get-together began, and 100,000 builders sang and danced on the construction site spanning dozens of miles. Thunderous applause and cheers erupted continuously from the crowd. Actors from more than 20 professional art troupes performed on both the north and south sides of the dam to offer their regards.

　　On the south side of Xiaogushan, more than 5,000 PLA soldiers, farmers, and commercial workers formed a large circle, watching the wonderful programs performed by the China Youth Art Theater and the Tianma Dance Troupe. As soon as nine actresses finished singing the ramming song praising the "Jiulan Group," nine girls wearing sky blue tops suddenly jumped onto the stage. They tightly grasped the actresses' hands and said, "Thank you for your encouragement. In the finishing project, we must work even harder." At this time, the audience shouted for the "Jiulan Group" to also sing a ramming song. Yan Xiulan, "Da Lan," casually composed a tune and led the singing: "The earthwork project is completed, everyone comes to celebrate. After the celebration, we must work even harder!"

　　In a circle on the north side of the dam, old farmer Chen Wenxiang, wearing a Ming Tombs Reservoir medal on his chest, was using his personal experience to tell the soldiers: "Before liberation, the farmers here were especially afraid of water. In one night, the water would flood hundreds of mu of surrounding fields. Now, everyone especially wants water, and they all hope it comes soon." His words expressed the joy of thousands of local farmers at the completion of the earthwork for the reservoir's dam.

　　At night, tens of thousands of lights were lit on the construction site, and the songs of 100,000 voluntary labor troops rose up. Cars and trains parked on both sides of the dam traveled incessantly on each line. The finishing of the dam and the beautification of the Ming Tombs Reservoir have begun. Their unanimous slogan is: Let the high mountains bow their heads, let the Dragon King surrender. We will never withdraw until we have built the Ming Tombs Reservoir well! (Attached pictures)

    拦洪大坝　横锁沙河
    十三陵水库十万建设者狂欢祝捷
    本报讯　十三陵水库的建设者经过一百四十昼夜的紧张劳动后，昨天人人振奋，个个欢腾，庆祝水库的主体工程——拦洪大坝的土方工程在洪水到来以前胜利完工。
    现在，这座耸立在明十三陵的蟒山和汉包山之间的拦洪大坝，已经把多年为患的温榆河的沙河支流紧紧锁住。这座像一条桂鱼斜卧在首都北郊的十三陵水库，能够拦住二百多平方公里流域面积内的洪水，蓄水六千万立方公尺，浇地二十五万多亩。
    有十万人参加的祝捷大会在下午三时开始。十三陵水库修建总指挥部总指挥罗文坊少将致开会词后，国务院副秘书长齐燕铭、中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇上将、水利电力部副部长张含英、教育部部长杨秀峰、中国人民解放军驻京部队司令员杨成武上将、中共北京市委书记处书记万里等先后讲了话。
    昨天，整个水库工地呈现出一片不寻常景象。到处是人山人海，红旗招展。毛主席写的“十三陵水库”五个大字贴在拦洪坝的胸前。
    国务院副秘书长齐燕铭代表国务院向水库建设者们表示祝贺。齐燕铭说，在党中央和毛主席关怀领导下，全体建设者们把水库的主要工程完成了。解放军在战争中是常胜军，在建设中是生产能手。机关干部、学生和其他知识分子，有相当一部分没有或很少劳动过，这次同人民群众一起修水库，从劳动中受到一次很好的锻炼和教育。许多国际友人和外国专家们也为水库付出了劳动，我们向他们表示感谢。
    甘泗淇、杨成武上将勉励全体建设者，要决心战斗到底，把水库的全部工程修得漂漂亮亮。
    中共北京市委书记处书记万里，代表市委向水库全体建设者致以热烈的祝贺。他说：首都人民把十三陵水库工地当作共产主义的大学校。今天所取得的胜利，是首都全民的胜利。他号召大家再接再厉，彻底完成水库的全部修建任务。
    工地的各段、队指挥向大会报捷和工地副总指挥宣布第四次评奖结束后，合唱队队员们唱起了音乐家歌颂十三陵水库的新作品“移山倒海”。
    联欢开始，十万建设者在方圆几十里的工地上载歌载舞，人群中不断爆发出雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声。二十多个专业艺术团体的演员们在大坝南北两面，进行慰问演出。
    在小孤山南面，五千多个解放军战士、农民和商业工作人员围成一个大圈，观看中国青年艺术剧院和天马舞蹈团演唱的精彩节目。九个女演员刚唱完赞扬“九兰组”的打夯歌，突然从台下跳上九个穿着天蓝色上衣的姑娘。她们紧紧握住女演员的手说：“谢谢你们对我们的鼓励。在结尾工程中，我们一定要干得更加努力。”这时，台下的观众高喊着要“九兰组”也唱一个打夯歌。“大兰”阎秀兰随口就编成曲子领唱起来：“土方工程完了工呀，大家来联欢啊。联欢结束后呀，更要加油干哪！”
    大坝北面的一个圆圈里，胸前挂着十三陵水库奖章的老农民陈文祥正在用亲身的经历，向战士们说：“解放前，这里的农民特别怕水，一夜之间，水就把周围几百亩田都淹没了。现在，大家特别想水，都希望它早点来。”他的话道出了当地千万农民对水库拦河大坝土方工程完工的喜悦心情。
    入夜，工地上万盏灯火齐明，十万义务劳动大军的歌声四起，停留在大坝两旁的汽车、火车，又川流不息地奔驰在各条线路上。大坝结尾和美化十三陵水库的各项工程开始了，他们一致的口号是：让高山低头，让龙王投降，不修好十三陵水库，决不收兵！（附图片）
