Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th Dispatch from TASS: The latest issue of the American "Time" magazine published an article commenting on Soviet scientific achievements. The magazine pointed out that Western evaluations of Soviet scientific achievements and potential have undergone tremendous changes in the past year. It wrote that a year ago, the West did not believe that the Soviet Union had solved the problem of launching artificial satellites. "Today, the large Russian satellite weighing one and a half tons and the small gadget called an American 'orange' by Premier Khrushchev are flying together in the sky, so Soviet science is recognized as dominant in the world. Achievements that Western scientists could only vaguely guess at as possible several years ago can now be compiled into a brilliant list that any country would be proud of..."

The article said: "The Soviet Union has the world's largest basic particle accelerator (synchrophasotron). Its power is almost twice that of the Berkeley accelerator in California, USA. The first Soviet jet airliner began flying more than two years earlier than the American one..."

The magazine said that Soviet scientists are leading the way in studying the principles of applying atomic energy. "These extremely significant achievements are due to a broad and powerful system of theoretical and practical research."

The magazine pointed out that despite the underestimation by many in the West, the Soviet Union has a long tradition of leadership in many scientific departments.

Billman, an American mathematician at the Rand Corporation, said: "It is surprising that few people in the West think about the deep scientific tradition of the Russians. In some scientific departments, we have always been behind them."

"Time" magazine wrote when explaining the reasons for the great achievements of the Soviet Union in various scientific departments, there the Soviet Union created various conditions for Soviet science and scientists. "The conditions created by the Soviet Union enable every Soviet youth to become a scientist, as long as he has sufficient talent. Now, Russia is training one to two times more engineers than the United States... Some people believe that in terms of scientific knowledge level, Soviet middle school graduates at the age of seventeen are two years ahead of their American counterparts."

    美国“时代”周刊承认
    苏联科学成就超过西方
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社纽约5日讯：最近一期美国“时代”周刊刊登了一篇评论苏联科学成就的文章。周刊指出，一年来西方对苏联科学的成就和潜力的评价发生了巨大的变化。它写道，一年前西方不相信苏联已经解决了发射人造卫星的问题，“今天，重量达一吨半的俄国大卫星和被赫鲁晓夫总理叫作美国‘橘子’的小玩意儿一同在天空中飞行，因而苏联的科学被公认为在世界上占主导地位。若干年以前西方科学家还只能模糊猜测有可能达到的成就，如今已经可以编成一张任何一国都要引以自豪的光辉的一览表了。……”
    文章说：“苏联拥有世界上最大的基本粒子加速器（同步稳相加速器）。它的功率几乎是美国加利福尼亚州柏克莱加速器的两倍。俄国的第一架喷气式客机开始飞行比美国早两年多……。”
    这家周刊说，在研究应用原子能的原理方面是苏联科学家领先。“获得这些极为重大的成就是因为有一个广泛的强有力的理论研究和实用研究体系。”
    这家周刊指出，尽管西方许多人估计不足，苏联在许多科学部门居领导地位是有悠久的传统的。
    “兰德公司”的美国数学家比尔曼说：“令人惊异的是，西方很少有人想到俄国人科学传统深厚这点。在某些科学部门，我们过去一直是落在他们后边的。”
    “时代”周刊在说明苏联各个科学部门都获得巨大成就的原因时写道，那里给苏联科学和科学家创造了各种条件。“苏联所创造的条件使每个苏联青年都能成为科学家，只要他有足够的才能就行。现在，俄国培养的工程师已经比美国多一倍到两倍……有人认为，在科学知识水平方面，苏联中学的十七岁的毕业生要超过美国同年学生两年”。
