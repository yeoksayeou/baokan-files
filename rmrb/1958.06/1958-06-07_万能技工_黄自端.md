　　"All-Round Technician" Huang Ziduan
    By Our Correspondents Wu Shiqiao and Chen Qitong

    Huang Ziduan, a technician at the Yongchun Farm Implement Factory in Fujian Province, known as an "all-round technician," has, over the past three years, with the support and encouragement of the local Communist Party committee and the farm implement factory leadership, transformed himself from an ordinary furniture worker into a "local expert" in machinery manufacturing and installation, renowned in several counties, through unwavering will and diligent study. In the past three years, he has not only collaborated with or led other employees to survey, design, and install more than twenty hydro-powered and hydroelectric joint processing plants for the rural areas of Yongchun, Dehua, Anxi, Nan'an and other counties, and trained more than twenty skilled workers, but also designed, manufactured and copied more than one thousand wooden water turbines, automatic conveyors, flour sifters, flour mills, potato grinding machines, potato cutting machines, tea kneading machines, bowl making machines, and deep plows, threshers, and other power, processing machinery and new agricultural implements, supplying the needs of hydropower stations and joint processing plants.

    Huang Ziduan is 40 years old this year. He had no schooling as a child, worked as an apprentice with a carpenter, and then worked as a carving worker in a furniture store, never having dealt with machines. After liberation, he came to the Yongchun Power Plant as a carpenter. He became deeply interested in how a generator could drive huge machines to produce and make electric lights shine. Whenever he had a break, he would squat next to the machines and chat with the mechanics, watching and asking questions. Over time, he not only learned some common sense about machine structure, performance, and equipment installation, but also learned a lot of fitter skills. His spirit of diligent study was valued by the Yongchun County Party Committee and the power plant leadership, who sent him to visit other places and sent him to a hydropower training class to study. Subsequently, he was transferred to the newly established farm implement factory to serve as a technical worker in machinery manufacturing and installation.

    In the process of learning by doing, Huang Ziduan overcame difficulties such as a low level of education, not being able to understand technical books, and not being able to take notes, and quickly transformed himself into an "all-round technician" with multiple skills such as surveying, design, machinery manufacturing, and installation. Once, when he had just returned to Yongchun from a visit to another place, the Penghu Hydroelectric Joint Processing Plant urgently needed to manufacture an automatic rice milling conveyor, but there was no one in the entire county who could design and manufacture this kind of machine. At this time, Huang Ziduan volunteered to take on the task. Based on his impressions of visiting automated processing plants in other places, he adopted the approach of designing, manufacturing, and improving simultaneously, spending more than three months, and finally successfully trial-produced the first automatic rice milling conveyor in Yongchun County. However, when the machine was test-run, a problem arose. As soon as the two automatic blowers blew air, they blew rice and rice husks out together. But Huang Ziduan was not discouraged. He continued to repeatedly assemble, disassemble and study. Late at night on the seventh day, he suddenly came up with a solution. He quickly got up, put on goggles and a mask, and crawled into the wind box of the operating blower to observe. He squatted in the wind box for several hours and finally found the source of the problem. After modification, the automatic conveyor was put into production. (Attached picture)

　　“万能技工”黄自端
    本报记者　吴世巧　陈启桐
    被称为“万能技工”的福建省永春农具厂技工黄自端，三年来，他在当地中共党委和农具厂领导上支持和鼓舞下，用百折不挠的意志和艰苦钻研的精神，从一个普通的家具工人，变成一个名闻数县的机械制造和安装的“土专家”。近三年来，他不但协同或领导其他职工先后为永春、德化、安溪、南安等县农村勘察、设计和安装了二十多个水力、水电联合加工厂，培养了二十多个熟练工人，同时还设计制造和仿制了一千多部木质水轮机、自动输送机、筛粉机、磨粉机、磨薯机、切薯机、揉茶机、制碗机和深耕犁、脱谷机等动力、加工机械和新农具，供应了水电站和联合加工厂的需要。
    黄自端今年40岁，从小没有念过书，跟着一个木匠师傅当学徒，以后就一直依靠他的灵巧的双手，在家具店中当雕花工人，一直没有和机器打过交道。解放后，他来到永春电厂作木工，他对一架发电机能带动巨大的机器生产并使电灯发光引起了浓厚的兴趣。每当休息的时候，他都要蹲在机器旁边和机工们闲聊，边看边问，日积月累，不但学会了一些机器结构、性能和安装设备的常识，还学会了不少的钳工技术。他这种钻研精神，受到中共永春县委和电厂领导上的重视，曾先后派他到外地去参观，还送他进水电训练班去学习。接着又调他到新成立的农具厂担任机械制造和安装技术工人。
    在边作边学当中，黄自端战胜了文化水平低，看不懂技术书籍和不会作笔记等困难，使自己迅速变成一个具有勘察、设计、机械制造和安装等多种技术的“万能技工”。有一次，当他刚从外地参观回到永春时，蓬壶水电联合加工厂急需制造一部碾米自动输送机，但全县找不到一个能设计和制造这种机器的人。这时，黄自端就自告奋勇地担负了这个任务。根据他在外地参观自动化加工厂的印象，采用边设计、边制造、边改进，前后花了三个多月，结果试制成功了永春县第一部碾米自动输送机。可是当这部机器试车生产时，问题又来了，两架自动鼓风机一鼓风就连米带谷皮一起刮出去，但是黄自端并不气馁，继续反复装拆研究，到第七天深夜，他忽然想出了一个办法，连忙起床，戴了风镜和口罩，钻进开动着机器的鼓风机的风箱里去观察，蹲在风箱里达几小时之久，终于找到了毛病所在，经过改制，这套自动输送机，就投入了生产。（附图片）
