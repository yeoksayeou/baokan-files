    Good News Continues to Pour in from the Bumper Harvest List
    Gucheng County
    △ Huang Mingshan, the team committee member of the 16th Team of the Dongsheng Cooperative in Hugang Township, Gucheng County, Hubei, experimented with 1.3 mu of land, which yielded a verified 2,411 jin and 12 liang of wheat per mu. Why was such a high yield achieved on this land? It was due to deep plowing twice to a depth of eight cun, full wide-row strip planting, weeding twice, preventing and controlling pests three times, and ensuring lodging prevention.
    Lushan County
    △ Six management districts including Huquan Store in Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, set new records for high-yield wheat production. By the morning of June 9th, the average yield per mu of the 19.7 mu of high-yield wheat that had been threshed was 1,412 jin. Among them, 1.02 mu of high-yield wheat in the Wang Xiaoshui Production Team of the Huquan Store Management District reached a yield of 2,563 jin and 2 liang per mu. During the harvesting, Li Tiancheng, the second secretary of the county party committee, participated in the entire harvesting process of this high-yield field from beginning to end and personally measured the land. This yield per unit area is 17.5 times higher than the average wheat yield of the entire township last year.
    △ The He Lou First Production Team's 1.12 mu of high-yield wheat field yielded an average of 2,074 jin per mu. The Guo Yunhe Production Team of the Huquan Store Management District's 1.6 mu of high-yield wheat yielded 1,750 jin per mu. The Li Jinming Production Team of the Xuezhai Management District's 1.09 mu of wheat yielded 1,512 jin per mu.
