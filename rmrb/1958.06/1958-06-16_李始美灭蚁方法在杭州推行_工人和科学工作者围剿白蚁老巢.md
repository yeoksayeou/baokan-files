Hangzhou, June 15 (Reported by our correspondent Tu Zhengfeng): Workers and scientific personnel in Hangzhou are using Li Shimei's ant eradication method to eliminate termites in Hangzhou, achieving positive results. On the morning of June 10th, at the Hangzhou Municipal Construction Workers Service Center, workers and scientific personnel for the first time uncovered the secrets of the main termite nest and royal chamber in Hangzhou. They also captured a queen termite about one inch long, with a head resembling a termite and a body resembling a silkworm, a young replacement queen, and a ochre-colored king termite much smaller than the queen.

This main termite nest was recently excavated from an earthen wall in the Hangzhou Children's Products Store by Zhu Zongxin, a carpenter at the Hangzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Service Department, and his ant eradication team, following Li Shimei's method of finding termites. Zhu Ruzuo, Chairman of the Hangzhou Branch of the Chinese Entomological Society, and Tang Jue, Associate Professor, and Li Fen, Teaching Assistant, of Zhejiang Agricultural College, who had previously attended Li Shimei's lectures in Shanghai, also participated in the dissection of the ant nest and the search and capture of the queen and king termites.

The dissection of the ant nest proceeded sequentially. First, the outer shell of the main nest was pried open, revealing the activity area of the worker termites, where the soil was loose and the tunnels were relatively large. After removing this layer of loose soil, the tunnels gradually narrowed, the soil layer became firmer, and a large number of white soldier termites with yellow heads and small pincers appeared. Deeper in, there were many larvae and piles of flesh-white termite eggs. Continuing the search, they soon discovered an oval-shaped cavity about one inch high, three inches wide, and seven inches deep, with smooth and hard surroundings. Compared with the tiny tunnels inhabited by the worker and soldier termites outside, this cavity appeared more spacious, and this was the royal chamber. In a deep hole in another corner of the royal chamber, the king and queen termites were captured. Continuing to peel open the ant nest layer by layer, a replacement queen termite, slightly larger than the average worker and soldier termite, was captured in a crevice.

The dissection proceeded smoothly, taking only two hours from start to capture of the queen termite. Through concrete practice and observation, the knowledge of workers and scientific personnel in eliminating termites has been greatly enriched, and scientific personnel have also been educated. Zhu Ruzuo, Chairman of the Hangzhou Entomological Society, said that he has been engaged in entomological research for thirty years, but this was his first time participating in the dissection of a main termite nest. This has been very enlightening for him.

Termites are widely distributed in Hangzhou and cause great harm, with the state paying a large sum of money for house repairs every year. In order to completely eliminate termites and rapidly promote Li Shimei's ant eradication experience in Hangzhou and other parts of Zhejiang, the Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee has decided to hold a training class with the participation of 500 people in the middle of this month and will invite Li Shimei to Hangzhou to give lectures.

### 李始美灭蚁方法在杭州推行  工人和科学工作者围剿白蚁老巢

    李始美灭蚁方法在杭州推行
    工人和科学工作者围剿白蚁老巢
    本报杭州15日电　记者屠正峰报道：杭州市工人和科学工作者用李始美灭蚁的方法在杭州消灭白蚁取得效果。10日上午在杭州市建筑工人修建服务处，工人和科学工作者第一次打开了杭州白蚁主巢、王宫的秘密。并且捉到了一条长约一寸，头似白蚁，身似蚕的蚁后、一只幼小的后补蚁后和一只比后蚁要小很多的赭石色的蚁王。
    这个白蚁主巢是最近曾在上海受过灭蚁短期训练的杭州市建筑木工朱宗信和他的灭蚁小组按照李始美寻找白蚁的方法，在杭州市儿童用品商店一道土墙里挖掘出来的。中国昆虫学会杭州分会理事长祝汝佐和曾在上海听过李始美讲学的浙江农学院副教授唐觉、助教李芬等都参加了解剖蚁巢，搜捉蚁后和蚁王的工作。
    解剖蚁巢是顺序前进的。首先将主巢的外壳撬开，里面就是工蚁的活动场所，泥土松软，孔道较大。去掉这层松土，孔道渐渐缩小，土层较坚，出现了大批黄头并长有一付小钳的白色兵蚁。再深一层，有很多幼蚁和成堆的肉白色的蚁卵。继续搜索下去，不久，发现了一个高约一寸，宽约三寸，深达七寸，周围光滑坚硬，椭圆形的洞穴。这个洞穴与外围工、兵蚁所居细小的洞穴对比起来，显得更宽畅，这就是王宫。在王宫的另一个拐角的深穴内捉住了蚁王和蚁后。把蚁巢继续一层层地剥开，在一个空隙中又捉住了一只身躯比一般工、兵蚁略大的候补蚁后。
    这次解剖工作进行得很顺利，从开始到捕获蚁后只花了二个小时。通过具体的实践和观察，大大地丰富了工人和科学工作者消灭白蚁的知识，也教育了科学工作者。杭州昆虫学会理事长祝汝佐教授说，他从事昆虫学研究工作已有三十年，但参加白蚁主巢解剖这还是第一次。这次对他启发很大。
    白蚁在杭州分布很广，为害很大，每年国家付出一笔很大的房屋修理费。为了彻底消灭白蚁，让李始美的灭蚁经验迅速地在杭州以及浙江各地推广。杭州市人民委员会已决定于本月中旬举办有五百人参加的消灭白蚁训练班，并将请李始美来杭讲学。（附图片）
