　　Next Year's Summer Harvest Will Be Even Better
    Bengbu Special District Organizes Visits, Appraisals, and Summarizes Experiences
    (Our report) Bengbu Special District in Anhui Province, in order to strive for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year, has begun various preparatory work ahead of schedule.

    The per-unit area yield of barley and rapeseed in Bengbu Special District this year has increased by about 50% compared to last year. Wheat is also growing very well and can also increase production compared to last year. In order to summarize the experience of increasing production and lay the foundation for a better harvest of summer crops next year, agricultural cooperatives in various places have begun to organize visits and appraisals, and to find out the experience of high yields in the fields. Huai Shang Agricultural Cooperative in Fengyang County recently mobilized more than 500 members to carry out mutual evaluation, and found a lot of experience and lessons from wheat that grew well and wheat that grew poorly. Through the appraisal, the whole cooperative has decided to comprehensively promote the planting of improved wheat varieties and close planting, and to apply more fertilizer in the autumn planting. Recently, Chu County organized township and commune cadres from the entire county to visit high-yield wheat. The wheat experimental field planted by cadres of the CPC Chu County Committee on 14 mu of poor land was praised by the visitors. Because these wheat plants were all strip-planted and densely planted, and the field management work was also done meticulously, the wheat grew better than the surrounding agricultural cooperatives. After the township and commune cadres visited, they all said that they would learn from the county party committee's experimental field in the autumn planting. The CPC Feidong County Committee also adopted the form of an on-site meeting, organizing district and township party committee secretaries in the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative to conduct visits, appraisals, exchange experiences, and deploy work.

    The seed selection work, which is related to the good or bad harvest of the summer season next year, has also begun. Various places have reserved sufficient seeds of various summer crops based on the comprehensive promotion of close planting in autumn planting. Some agricultural cooperatives have also reserved double sets of seeds to guard against natural disasters.

    Preparing basal fertilizer for autumn planting is also one of the current agricultural activities of farmers. The entire special district requires 1,000 dan of fertilizer to be applied per mu. In addition to developing various fertilizer sources, agricultural cooperatives are also generally digging field head cellars to chop green grass and compost green manure, and it is estimated that there will be one field head cellar for every five mu of land in the entire district. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in various places have also paid attention to arranging crop stubble to ensure that summer crops are planted in a timely manner. Various autumn planting farm tools are also being tested and improved according to the new situation of promoting close planting. The CPC Bengbu Prefectural Committee attaches great importance to the early preparation for striving for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year. It has recently held a telephone conference to make specific arrangements, and requires party committees in various places to continuously solve various ideological obstacles in this work.

　　明年的夏季收成要比今年更好
    蚌埠专区组织参观评比总结经验
    本报讯  安徽省蚌埠专区农民为争取明年午（夏）季作物更大丰收，已提早进行各项准备工作。
    蚌埠专区今年的大麦和油菜单位面积产量都比去年提高了五成左右。小麦生长得也非常好，也可比去年增产。为总结增产经验，替明年午季作物获得更好的收成打下基础，各地农业社已开始组织参观评比，深入田间找出丰产的经验。凤阳县淮上农业社最近发动五百多社员开展互评互比，从长得好和长得差的小麦中找出了很多经验教训。通过评比全社已决定在秋种中全部推广优良麦种和密植，增施更多的肥料。滁县最近组织全县乡、社干部参观丰产小麦，中共滁县委员会干部在十四亩孬地里种的小麦试验田受到了参观者的称赞。由于这些小麦全部是条播密植的，田间管理工作也作得细致，小麦长得比周围农业社的好，乡、社干部参观过后，都表示秋种中也要学着县委试验田那样做。中共肥东县委并采取了现场会议的形式，组织区、乡党委书记在星光农业社进行边参观、边评比、边交流经验、边布置工作。
    关系来年午季收成好坏的选种工作也已开始进行。各地根据秋种中全面推广密植的情况，留足各种午季作物种籽。有的农业社还留了双套种籽，以防备自然灾害。
    为秋种准备基肥也是农民当前的农事活动之一。全专区要求每亩施肥千担。各农业社除开辟各种肥源外，正在普遍挖田头窖，以便砍青草沤绿肥，预计全区每五亩田就有一个田头窖。此外，各地农业社还注意了安排农作物的茬口，保证午季作物及时下种。各种秋种农具也正在根据推行密植等新情况，试验改良。中共蚌埠地委对提早准备，争取明年午季作物获得更大丰收工作很重视，最近已召开了电话会议，作了具体布置，并要求各地党委在这一工作中要不断解决各种思想障碍。
