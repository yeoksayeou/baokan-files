Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: The American "Workers' Weekly" published an article by George Morris on June 15th, entitled "Seasonal Trends Cannot Support the Government's Boasting."

In the article, Morris pointed out that the Eisenhower government is trying to put forward false explanations and exaggerate seasonal factors in order to boast that the US economy is recovering.

Morris said that this effort was powerfully refuted last week by research reports from the Department of Commerce and a Joint Economic Committee of Congress. A study conducted jointly by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission found that corporate spending on expansion and the addition of new plants and equipment significantly lagged behind the government's own earlier estimates.

Originally, it was expected that this expenditure would decrease by 14% compared to last year. Contrary to expectations, this expenditure decreased by 17%, and according to this research report, there are indications that it will decrease even more drastically in the future, at least by 7 billion less than last year's 35 billion.

The staff of this Congressional Joint Economic Committee concluded in a research report that this factor and other factors will "offset" the stimulating effect of government spending on military and other purposes on the economy.

Based on a study of past economic recessions, this committee of Congress believes that a recovery to the level of last July "will not be achieved at the earliest until mid-1959, and possibly not until the end of 1960."

This Congressional Joint Economic Committee (which is the most authoritative economic research institution in Congress) believes that the possibility of a reduction in the number of unemployed this year or this winter is extremely small, and that by the first quarter of 1959, the number of unemployed may "reach as high as seven million."

The basic trend of production reduction in manufacturing continues, and the number of unemployed has increased by another 67,000, reaching a new low of only 15 million employed in factories. This is the lowest in many years.

A sharp increase in the number of unemployed can be seen in the government employment report for next month. In addition to reflecting continued layoffs (especially in the automotive and auto parts industries), this also reflects the inability of high school and college graduates to find jobs and the usual reduction in employment in many industries during the summer.

At the same time, the lines of people receiving family relief are growing longer and longer, because the unemployed have exhausted their unemployment benefits and savings and have no other way out.

Morris went on to talk about the falsity of the survey report published by the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare on the increase in the number of people receiving relief. This report said that the trend of the number of people receiving relief up to the end of April was "slow," and that only 120,000 families of unemployed had been added in this economic crisis, with a total of 450,000 families and 1.31 million men, women, and children on the relief rolls.

Morris pointed out that this report did not mention the undoubtedly much larger number of poor unemployed people who cannot be included on the relief lists because they nominally still have houses, etc., or, in many states, because close relatives are still working and they cannot get assistance. Tens of thousands of people are suffering extreme poverty without asking for public relief. Many people apply for relief from private charities that are already overcrowded in order to avoid state or local regulations and conditions. In many states, the relief standards are so low that it is not worth applying.

### 制造业继续减产　失业者仍在增加  美国经济毫无“恢复”迹象  “工人周报”用事实驳倒政府的吹嘘

    制造业继续减产　失业者仍在增加
    美国经济毫无“恢复”迹象
    “工人周报”用事实驳倒政府的吹嘘
    据新华社29日讯　美国“工人周报”6月15日刊载了乔治·摩里斯的一篇文章，题目是“季节性的趋向不能支持政府的吹嘘”。
    摩里斯在文章中指出：艾森豪威尔政府努力提出虚伪的说明和夸大季节性因素，借此来吹嘘美国经济正在恢复。
    摩里斯说，它的这种努力上星期已被商务部和国会一个经济联席委员会的研究报告有力地驳倒了。商务部同证券和交易委员会共同进行的一项研究，发现企业方面用在扩建及添设新厂和新装备上的开支大大地落后于政府自己早些时候的估计。
    原来预料这种开支要比去年减少14％，同预料的相反，这种开支减少了17％，而且据这份研究报告说，有迹象表明将来还要减少得更剧烈，至少要比去年的三百五十亿减少七十亿。
    这个国会经济联席委员会的工作人员在研究报告中得出结论说，这个因素和其他因素将“抵销”政府用在军事用途和其他用途的开支对经济所造成的刺激作用。
    根据对过去经济衰退的研究，国会的这个委员会认为，要恢复到去年7月的水平“最早也不会像在1959年年中以前达到，而且可能非到1960年年底不能达到”。
    这个国会联席委员会（它是国会最有权威的经济研究机构）认为，今年或今冬失业人数减少的可能性是极小的，到1959年第一季度时失业人数可能“多达七百万人”。
    制造业方面生产减缩的基本趋向仍在继续，失业人数又增加了六万七千人，达到了工厂中就业人数只有一千五百万的新低潮。这是许多年来最低的。
    预计下个月的政府就业报告中可以看到失业人数会有急剧增加，这里面除了反映了继续解雇（特别是汽车及汽车附件业）外，还反映了大中学生毕业生找不到工作和许多行业在夏季常有的就业人数减少的情况。
    同时，列队领取家庭救济的人越来越多了，因为失业者已经提取完了他们的失业津贴和积蓄，没有其他办法。
    摩里斯接着谈到美国政府卫生、教育和福利部所公布的对领取救济金人数的增加情况的调查报告的虚假性。这个报告说迄至4月底为止领取救济金人数的发展趋向是“缓慢的”，在这次经济危机中失业者只增加了一十二万个家庭，救济名册上共有四十五万个家庭，一百三十一万男女和儿童。
    摩里斯指出，这个报告没有指出人数无疑要大得多的贫穷的失业者，他们不能列在救济名单上，因为他们说起来还有房子等，或者在许多州内因为近亲还在工作而不能得到援助。成千成万的人遭到了极端贫困的痛苦而没有要求公共救济。很多人为了避免州或地方的规定条件而到已经过分拥挤的私人慈善团体中去申请救济。在许多州里，救济标准很低，不值得去申请。
