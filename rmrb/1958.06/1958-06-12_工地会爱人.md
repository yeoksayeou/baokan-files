    A Construction Site Loves Her
    By our reporter, Zhang Zhiqing

    One afternoon, at the No. 4 Team of the No. 6 Farmer's Brigade working on the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, a PLA officer in his thirties arrived. As soon as he got to the site, he picked up a carrying pole and baskets and started carrying dirt with everyone else.

    Before long, this officer started a labor competition with the female deputy team leader, Jin Guizhen. Jin Guizhen carried dirt, and the officer carried dirt too. Jin Guizhen filled her baskets, and the officer filled his baskets to overflowing. The officer carried one more basket, and Jin Guizhen immediately caught up. Neither of them was willing to fall behind. The farmers were very curious. Why did this officer come to our farmers' team and compete with our team leader?

    It turned out that this officer was named Zhang Tianming, and he was Jin Guizhen's husband. Zhang Tianming had just returned home from the army on leave the day before. When he got home, he saw that everyone had gone to build the Ming Tombs Reservoir, and his wife was also at the construction site. He thought, everyone is working hard on the reservoir construction site, racing against the floods. How could he stay at home on vacation? The next day, he came to the construction site and started a competition with his wife, Jin Guizhen. Some people advised him to rest well, but Zhang Tianming said, "I have a part to play in building the reservoir. I am so happy to be able to participate in building the reservoir in my hometown." And so, Zhang Tianming worked with everyone for seven days.

    As his vacation was coming to an end, Zhang Tianming said to Jin Guizhen, "The reservoir construction is so intense. I will take care of the preparations for my return to the army myself. You work hard on the construction site!"

    At the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, many people spread the story of Zhang Tianming and his wife working together to build the reservoir during his vacation as a good story, saying, "One is a PLA officer, and the other is a production expert in the agricultural cooperative. It's truly a red flower with green leaves." (Attached pictures)

    工地会爱人
    本报记者　张志清
    一天下午，修十三陵水库的农民六大队四中队里，来了一位三十岁上下的解放军军官，他一到工地就拿起扁担筐子和大家一起担土。
    不一会，这位军官和女副队长靳桂贞展开了劳动竞赛。靳桂贞担土这位军官也担土，靳桂贞装满筐这位军官就装尖筐，军官多担了一筐，靳桂贞立即赶上，两个人谁也不肯落在后边。农民们很奇怪，为什么这个军官到我们农民队伍里来，还和我们的队长竞赛呢？
    原来，这个军官叫张天明，是靳桂贞的爱人。张天明头天刚由部队回家休假，到家一看，大家都去修十三陵水库了，自己的爱人也在工地。他想，大家都在水库工地上紧张地和洪水争先，自己怎么能在家里休假呢？第二天他就到工地上来了，并且和他的爱人靳桂贞开展了竞赛。有人劝他好好休息，张天明说：“修水库我也有份啊，我能参加修建家乡的水库，太幸福了。”就这样，张天明和大家一起劳动了七天。
    假期快满了，张天明对靳桂贞说：“修水库这样紧张，我回部队以前的准备工作自己会料理，你好好在工地上干吧！”
    十三陵水库工地上，很多人把张天明休假期间和爱人一起修水库的事传为佳话，都说：“一个是解放军军官，一个是农业社生产能手，真是红花配绿叶啊。”（附图片）
