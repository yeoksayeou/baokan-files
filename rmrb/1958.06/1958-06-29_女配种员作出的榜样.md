The advanced deeds of women during the Great Leap Forward have been widely praised and celebrated. However, in terms of the depth of the impact on feudal ideology and the magnitude of the shock to social customs, the actions of two young female breeders from the Mingxing (Star) Cooperative in Xuzhai Township, Ganquan County, Shaanxi Province, are particularly outstanding.

Breeder is a new term. In northern China, the local names for it are “la gongzi” (pulling the master) or “min zhuang” (people’s post), which means leading studs, donkeys, or bulls to help female animals mate. In the old society, this occupation was the most despised. Even men who engaged in this profession were looked down upon. How could women dare to engage in this occupation? If they did, they would be scolded by the old feudalists as "shameless."

Looking down on this occupation has no scientific basis nor any explicit regulations, but it is an old custom that has been passed down through generations. Precisely because of this, it has even more obstructive power. The first ones to dare to fight against this traditional old thinking must be people who are concerned about public welfare, understand the big picture, and have great courage. The two young female breeders mentioned above are the vanguards who charged forward to attack this bad ideology.

Xuzhai Township in Ganquan County is located in a remote mountain valley. During the agricultural Great Leap Forward, livestock breeding became the weakest link. Due to the lack of animal power, in just one village in this township, more than 100 mu of wheat could not be sown in time. One can imagine the anxiety of the people about this problem. The Party branch grasped this problem and organized a debate, deciding to breed livestock.

Breeding naturally requires mating; but when a male member of the Mingxing Cooperative led a stud for mating, he was ridiculed, and he angrily quit. The problem was raised at the Party branch meeting. What to do? It is impossible to do it without changing this atmosphere. Therefore, the Party branch secretary and the township head personally led the studs, going around to mate, setting an example for those old feudalists to see. This inspired two heroines: one was Hu Shulian, the deputy director of the Mingxing Cooperative, who was about twenty years old, and the other was Yang Guiying, the production team leader, who was twenty-five or six years old. They believed that this was solving a major difficulty for the cooperative and was the most glorious thing. Why should they be afraid of anyone talking nonsense? So, they led the studs.

These two young women, on a market day in Ganquan County, strode confidently, leading a large chestnut-red stallion, and stood in a spacious place. People swarmed around, and immediately someone brought a female donkey for mating. They were serious and generous, engaging in mating work conscientiously. In their bright eyes, there was a sparkle of pride, and sometimes a challenging glance around, as if inquiring, wanting to hear who dared to say anything?

Honest men had ashamed looks on their faces, and they discussed, "Young women dare to do this, if we men don't dare to do it, are we still men?" Some old feudalists clicked their tongues and said, "Heavens, these two young ladies are really brave."

The courage of the "two young ladies" is indeed greater than that of Mu Guiying, who broke the Tianmen Formation. But more importantly, their noble communist style of regarding all beneficial labor as glorious, bravely advancing for the benefit of the masses, and daring to lead people to charge against the old forces, is something that Mu Guiying could never match.

Later, it was said that Zhao Shoushan, the Governor of Shaanxi Province, also personally led a stud to mate. Then, the thoughts and actions of these two young female breeders are no less remarkable than those of the Governor. Facts prove that all those who dare to face the truth and fight for it are equally great, worthy of respect and emulation.

    女配种员作出的榜样
    吕秦姬
    在大跃进中，妇女们的先进事迹，被人们传颂赞扬的很不少了，但如果从对封建思想的冲击之深，对社会风气的震动之大来说，还要算陕西省甘泉县许寨乡明星社的两个青年女配种员的事出色。
    配种员是个新名词。它的土名在中国的北方叫“拉公子”，又叫“民桩”，也就是拉了种马、种驴或者种牛，帮同母畜交配。这种职业，在旧社会最被轻视。即使是男人从事了这种职业，也受轻视。女人哪里敢去从事这种职业？要干，更会被老封建们骂作“不要脸”。
    轻视这种职业是既无科学根据也无明文规定的，但这是老风气，一直相传继着。唯其如此，它才更有阻碍的力量。首先敢起来同这种传统的旧思想进行搏斗的，必然是急公益，识大体，又大有勇气的人才行。上面说的这两个青年女配种员，就是向这种坏思想冲锋陷阵的急先锋。
    甘泉县的许寨乡，处在一个偏僻的山沟里，在农业大跃进中，牲畜的繁殖成了最薄弱的一环。由于缺乏畜力，仅这个乡当中的一个村子，就有一百多亩麦子没有能够及时下种，人们对于这个问题的焦急心情是可以想见的。党的支部抓住了这个问题，组织了一场辩论，决定要繁殖牲畜。
    繁殖自然先要配种；但当明星社的一个男社员拉着种畜配种时，却受到了讥笑，他气得不干了。问题提到了党的支部会上，怎么办？不改变这种风气是不行的。于是，乡的党支部书记、乡长都亲自拉了种畜，到处串着配种，作样子给那些老封建们看一看。这么一来就激起了两位女英雄：一个是明星社的副社长，名叫胡树莲，年方二十岁左右，一个是生产队长杨桂英，年方二十五、六。她们认为，这是解决社里的大困难，是最光荣的事，怕他谁胡说些什么？于是，她们拉起种畜来了。
    这两位年青妇女，在甘泉县城的一个集日上，昂首阔步的拉着一匹枣红色大儿马，找了一个宽敞的地方一站。人们蜂涌的围了上来，立即就有人拉来了母驴配种。她们两个严肃大方，认真的从事着配种工作。明亮的眼睛里，闪烁着骄傲的光芒，有时挑战似的迅速地环顾一下四周，好像是在探询，倒要听听谁敢说什么？
    正直的男人们脸上带有着惭愧，议论说，“年轻女人都敢这样干，我们男人不敢干，还算话吗”？也有些老封建，吐一吐舌头说，“天爷，这两位姑奶奶胆子可真不小了。”
    “两位姑奶奶”的胆量的确比大破天门阵的穆桂英还大。但更重要的是她们把一切有益的劳动都看作光荣，为了群众的利益勇往直前，敢于率领人们向旧势力冲锋陷阵的高尚的共产主义风格，又是穆桂英所万万不能及的。
    后来，据说陕西省赵寿山省长也亲自拉种畜配种了。那么，这两位青年女配种员的思想和行动，较之省长是不算逊色的，事实证明，所有敢于正视真理并为之奋斗的人，都同样是伟大的，值得人们尊敬而且效法的。
