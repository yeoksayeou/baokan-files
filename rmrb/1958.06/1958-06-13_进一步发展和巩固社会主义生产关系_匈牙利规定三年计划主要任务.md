Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 11th: At a report meeting here on the 9th, Jenő Fock, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, pointed out that Hungary's work to consolidate the national economy had ended in 1957, and the recovery of Hungary's economic life after the counter-revolutionary events of October the year before was faster than expected. He said that currently, what Hungary needs to decide is not the issue of consolidating the economy, but the speed and prospects of socialist economic development.

In a report entitled "Some Issues of Our Economic Policy and Instructions for the Three-Year Plan," Fock first briefly described the achievements Hungary has made in the past few years. He pointed out that in 1955, Hungary's industrial output had nearly tripled that of 1938. The number of employees in factories increased from 332,000 in 1938 to 700,500 in 1957. Employees' income increased by nearly one-third from 1949 to 1956. He said that if the party and state leadership had not made the mistakes that everyone knows about, greater achievements could have been made.

When talking about the instructions for the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960), Fock said that starting this year, we will ensure that Hungary's international balance of payments reaches equilibrium. During the Three-Year Plan, we must further develop and consolidate our country's socialist relations of production, first of all by supporting the agricultural cooperation movement. One of our most important tasks is to gradually eliminate the imbalances existing in the Hungarian national economy.

He said that we will continue to develop industry, especially heavy industry. The Three-Year Plan stipulates that the output of large-scale industry will increase by 24%, and the output of the entire socialist industry will increase by more than 22%. Labor productivity in industry will increase by 15%, and the increase in industrial output will mainly rely on increasing labor productivity. In these three years, state investment will reach 32 billion forints, a large part of which will be used for the machinery manufacturing industry. He pointed out that the Three-Year Plan stipulates that the output of high-voltage equipment will increase by 41%, telecommunications equipment will increase by 72%, and instrument output will increase by 62%.

Fock then talked about the issue of restructuring the industrial structure. He said that our industrial structure should adapt to the increasing domestic consumption and foreign demand. At the same time, technological reforms should also be accelerated. In addition, compared with the average consumption during the First Five-Year Plan (1950-1954), by 1960, Hungary's meat consumption will increase by 25%, sugar consumption will increase by 40%, and dairy product consumption will increase by 32%.

Fock said that during the Three-Year Plan, Hungary's long-term loans used to help develop agriculture will increase by 82% compared to 1957, the real wages of employees will increase by about 6%, and the income of agricultural laborers will increase by 4% to 5%. During this period, residential construction will increase by 60% compared to the First Five-Year Plan period.

    进一步发展和巩固社会主义生产关系
    匈牙利规定三年计划主要任务
    据新华社布达佩斯11日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会书记福克·耶诺9日在这里的一次报告会上指出，匈牙利巩固国民经济的工作已经在1957年结束，前年十月反革命事件后，匈牙利经济生活恢复的速度比预期的为快。他说，目前，匈牙利需要决定的已经不是巩固经济的问题，而是社会主义经济发展速度和前景的问题。
    福克在题为“我们的经济政策的若干问题和三年计划指示”的报告中首先扼要地叙述了过去几年匈牙利所取得的成就。他指出，1955年匈牙利的工业产量就将近增加为1938年的三倍。工厂中的职工从1938年的三十三万二千人，增加到1957年的七十万零五千人。职工的收入从1949年到1956年增加了将近三分之一。他说，假如过去党和国家的领导机构没有犯过大家所知道的那些错误，那末，本来是可以取得更大的成就的。
    福克在谈到三年计划（1958—1960年）指示时说，从今年起，我们将确保匈牙利的国际收支达到平衡。在三年计划期间，我们必须进一步发展和巩固我国的社会主义生产关系，首先是要支持农业合作化运动。我们最重要的任务之一是逐渐消除匈牙利国民经济中存在的不平衡状态。
    他说，我们将继续发展工业，特别是重工业。三年计划规定，大工业的产量将增加24％，整个社会主义工业产量将增加22％以上。工业中的劳动生产率将提高15％，工业产量的增加将主要依靠提高劳动生产率来实现。在这三年中，国家投资将达到三百二十亿福林，其中很大一部分将用于机器制造业。他指出，三年计划规定高电压设备的产量将增加41％，电讯器材将增加72％，仪器产量将增加62％。
    福克接着谈到了改组工业结构的问题。他说，我们的工业结构应当适应日益增加的国内消费和国外的需求。同时，还应该加速进行技术改革。此外，同第一个五年计划期间（1950—1954年）的平均消费量比较，到1960年，匈牙利的肉类消费量将增加25％，糖的消费量将增加40％，奶制品的消费量将增加32％。
    福克说，三年计划期间，匈牙利用来帮助发展农业的长期贷款，将比1957年增加82％，职工的实际工资将增加6％左右，农业劳动者的收入将增加4％到5％。在这个时期，住宅建筑将比第一个五年计划期间增加60％。
