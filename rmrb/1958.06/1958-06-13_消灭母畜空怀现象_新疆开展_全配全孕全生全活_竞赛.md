Eliminate Empty Pregnancy in Female Livestock
Xinjiang Launches "All Mated, All Pregnant, All Born, All Survive" Competition

Urumqi, June 12th (report from our newspaper) — The mating season for large livestock in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has arrived, and the vast agricultural and pastoral areas are launching a "All Mated, All Pregnant, All Born, All Survive" competition, striving to ensure that all eligible female animals are mated and become pregnant. Herdsmen in the Altai Mountains, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, and Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture have proposed 100% mating of eligible female livestock. Qitai County will establish large livestock breeding headquarters at the county, district, and township levels this year, implement a layered contract system, and work hard for three months to ensure that more than 10,000 mares and cows become pregnant, striving to become a county with "a thousand horses, a thousand foals, a thousand cattle, a thousand calves." In order to improve the quality of female livestock, many pastoral cooperatives classify female livestock according to their physical condition, and separate those that are under reproductive age, overage, and have infectious diseases for grazing, in order to increase the conception rate of eligible female livestock.

By the end of last year, the number of horses, cattle, donkeys, mules, and camels in the entire autonomous region had increased to more than 4.5 million, an increase of 29.94% compared to 1952. However, due to the prevailing idea in various places that "waiting for tractors makes livestock breeding unimportant," the breeding potential of large livestock has not been fully realized, and the phenomenon of empty pregnancy in female livestock and slaughtering of eligible female livestock is quite serious. In many areas, especially agricultural areas, because they only focus on draught power and not on breeding, and lack organized breeding plans, a large number of eligible female livestock are not mated every year, which greatly hinders the rapid breeding of large livestock.

In order to meet the demands of the great leap forward in agricultural production for draught animals, the department in charge of animal husbandry in the autonomous region recently held symposia on large livestock breeding in northern and southern Xinjiang in Urumqi and Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, respectively. The meetings called on all localities to quickly change the backward situation of large livestock breeding. This year, all of the autonomous region's more than one million female livestock must be mated, and efforts should be made to eliminate the phenomenon of empty pregnancy in female livestock. From strengthening feeding management and preventing epidemics, efforts should be made to enhance the physical fitness of female livestock and increase the survival rate of young livestock.

### 消灭母畜空怀现象  新疆开展“全配全孕全生全活”竞赛

    消灭母畜空怀现象
    新疆开展“全配全孕全生全活”竞赛
    本报乌鲁木齐12日电　新疆维吾尔自治区大家畜配种季节已经到来，广大农牧区正在开展“全配、全孕、全生、全活”的竞赛，力争实现适龄母畜头头配种，个个怀胎。阿尔泰山区、巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州、克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州的牧民们提出适龄母畜百分之百配种。奇台县今年将在县、区、乡成立大畜繁殖指挥部，实行层层包干制，苦战三月，使一万多匹母马和母牛，个个怀胎，争取成为“千马千驹、千牛千犊”的县。很多地区的牧业社为了提高母畜质量，按母畜体质好坏分等编群，并把不到生殖年龄、超龄和有传染病的母畜分开牧放，以增加适龄母畜受胎率。
    全自治区到去年年底，马、牛、驴、骡、骆驼已繁殖到四百五十多万头，比1952年增加29.94％。但是由于各地存在着“等待拖拉机，大畜繁殖不重要”的思想，大家畜的繁殖潜力远远没有发挥，母畜空怀和屠宰适龄母畜的现象相当严重。很多地区特别是农业区，因为只重役使不重繁殖，缺乏组织配种计划，每年都有大量适龄母畜不配种，大大阻碍了大家畜的迅速繁殖。
    为了适应农业生产大跃进对耕畜的要求，自治区主管畜牧的部门最近在乌鲁木齐市、克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州分别召开了北疆、南疆大家畜繁殖工作座谈会。会议要求各地迅速改变大家畜繁殖的落后状况，今年全自治区一百多万头母畜要全部配种，尽力消灭母畜空怀现象，并从加强饲养管理、预防疫病等方面，增强母畜体质，提高幼畜成活率。
