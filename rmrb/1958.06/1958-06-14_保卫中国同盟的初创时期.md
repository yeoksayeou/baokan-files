The China Defence League was established in 1938. During the four years until the outbreak of the Pacific War at the end of 1941, I had the honor of doing minor work under the leadership of Mr. Song Qingling. Therefore, I still remember some of the major events during these four years. On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the founding of the China Defence League, I will record it.

    The China Defence League was founded in the second year of the Chinese people's arduous war of resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression. The war of resistance must be protracted, the struggle must be arduous, and victory can only be achieved by fully mobilizing the masses and persevering to the end. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek was comprehensively suppressing the people's anti-Japanese mass movement, blockading the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, cutting off food and supplies, and contacting Japan in many ways, so that the Japanese invading army could concentrate its firepower on attacking the people's army. Anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare of the masses sprung up everywhere. They had no money, no doctors, no medicines. The China Defence League was born under such circumstances, called for by Mr. Song Qingling. Its purpose was to assist the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, provide support to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and provide relief to patriotic compatriots and guerrilla fighters and commanders wounded in the guerrilla areas and behind enemy lines.

    Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionaries were blatant in their sabotage. They created a whole set of official "Support the War Against the Enemy Associations," the purpose of which was to unify all fund-raising, strictly control all similar patriotic donation movements, and control the patriotic donation groups of overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang through their special agent lines, in an attempt to make every penny fall into Chiang Kai-shek's pocket. Their slogan was: "Independent fund-raising is opposing Chiang Kai-shek, opposing the government, and opposing the war of resistance." The China Defence League overcame all difficulties and resolutely took on the tasks it shouldered.

    In order to accomplish such a task, the China Defence League had to be located in Hong Kong until the Japanese imperialists attacked Hong Kong. International friends from all over the world who supported the Chinese people's war of resistance, as well as patriotic overseas Chinese, began to donate bit by bit. Medical personnel and medicines serving the guerrilla areas, battlefield service teams and ambulance teams composed of overseas Chinese serving the guerrilla areas, overcame various difficulties and were continuously delivered to the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the guerrilla teams from Shenzhen, Dongjiang, and Hanoi. The communication equipment at the time of the establishment of the New Fourth Army was also donated by the China Defence League.

    The Japanese imperialists occupied Guangzhou, followed by the occupation of Wuhan. Hong Kong became an isolated island where Japanese special agents swaggered. Domestically, Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist conspiracy was even more blatant, and donations to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were even more subject to the shameless obstruction and open sabotage by Kuomintang agents. Under such circumstances, the activities of the China Defence League were further expanded, and more donations were received for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. The International Peace Hospital opened in Yan'an was initiated and supported by the China Defence League after the fall of Guangzhou. Prominent overseas Chinese leaders Mr. Tan Kah Kee and Mr. Situ Meitang also made great contributions to assisting the China Defence League.

    Chiang Kai-shek used various despicable means to threaten the China Defence League, and even used British imperialism and its agents in Hong Kong to intimidate and threaten it. But the China Defence League responded to these conspiracies with redoubled efforts. Many film and drama charity sales were organized in Hong Kong to raise funds to support the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Dongjiang Column, and various guerrilla forces.

    Chiang Kai-shek also mobilized the British ambassador stationed in Chongqing to threaten Ms. Song Qingling, attempting to persuade her to leave Hong Kong and give up the work of the China Defence League. Ms. Song Qingling had a fierce debate with him, and the British ambassador walked away in shame.

    After the Southern Anhui Incident, Ms. Song Qingling sternly condemned Chiang Kai-shek's criminal behavior, and at the same time, through the China Defence League, she accused Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of destroying the New Fourth Army and surrounding and blockading the Eighth Route Army to the world, and won the support of international friends and patriotic overseas Chinese who supported the Chinese people's war of resistance.

    The China Defence League also supported the progressive cultural and journalistic undertakings in Hong Kong at that time. The pro-justice "Wah Sheung Daily," which was published in Hong Kong after the Southern Anhui Incident, was funded by the China Defence League.

    The China Defence League also carried out international anti-Japanese united front work to support the war of resistance, oppose regression, and oppose surrender. It established close ties with the Aid China Associations in the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and other places, and provided them with information about supporting China's war of resistance and the activities of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

    In just four years, the China Defence League did a lot of work. Of course, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army mainly relied on the support of the masses, relied on the style of hard work and simplicity, and relied on the weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies captured from the enemy to solve difficulties; but the China Defence League completed its tasks on the side, in some corners, and played a certain role.

    I can't help but recall how Ms. Song Qingling carried out strong and unyielding work in those four years of hardship, under the accusations of relatives and friends, the intimidation of secret agents, the slander and sabotage of imperialist colonialists, and the threats and rumors of Chiang Kai-shek. Time flies so fast, it has been twenty years, these twenty years are really extraordinary twenty years. I can't help but recall the scene when the China Defence League was announced to be established in a small living room in Ms. Song Qingling's residence in Hong Kong twenty years ago by five or six people, and Ms. Song Qingling's happy mood of waving to millions of people on Tiananmen Square on October 1, 1949. Struggle is always carried out bit by bit. Only those who selflessly carry out the struggle bit by bit can share the joy and excitement of the great victory in which their own labor is involved.

    保卫中国同盟的初创时期
    廖承志
    1938年保卫中国同盟创立，到1941年底太平洋战争爆发的四年间，我荣幸地在宋庆龄先生领导下，做过微小的工作。因此这四年间的大事，我还记得一些。际此保卫中国同盟成立二十周年的时候，将它纪录下来。
    保卫中国同盟创立的时候，正是中国人民对日本帝国主义的侵略进行艰苦抗战的第二年。抗战必须持久，斗争一定艰巨，只有充分发动群众坚持到底才能取得胜利。而蒋介石在那个时候，正全面地压迫人民的抗日群众运动，对中国共产党领导下的八路军和新四军进行封锁，断绝粮饷接济，并多方和日本接触，使日本的侵华军队集中火力进攻人民军队。群众的抗日游击战争到处风起云涌。他们没有钱，没有医生，没有药品，保卫中国同盟就是在这样的情况下，由宋庆龄先生号召而诞生的。它的目的就是援助抗日游击战争，给八路军、新四军支援，并救济在游击区和敌后受伤的爱国同胞和游击队的战斗员、指挥员。
    蒋介石和国民党反动派的破坏是明目张胆的。他们搞成了一整套官办的“抗敌后援会”，目的是统一一切募捐，严格控制所有的类似的爱国捐献运动，并通过其特务线索控制南洋各地华侨的爱国捐献团体，企图使每一分钱都落在蒋介石的腰包里。他们的口号就是：“进行独立募捐就是反对蒋介石，就是反对政府，就是反对抗战。”保卫中国同盟克服了一切困难，毅然担起了它所应当担负的任务。
    保卫中国同盟为完成这样的任务，不得不设在香港，直到日本帝国主义进攻香港的时候。全世界各地支援中国人民抗战的国际朋友，以及爱国华侨，开始点点滴滴的捐款。到游击区服务的医疗人员、药品，由华侨组成的到游击区服务的战地服务队、救护车队，克服了各种困难，由深圳、东江、河内源源地送达到八路军、新四军和游击队伍。新四军成立时的通讯设备也是保卫中国同盟募捐助成的。
    日本帝国主义侵占了广州，跟着侵占了武汉。香港成为日本特务横行阔步的孤岛。在国内，蒋介石的反共阴谋更露骨了，对八路军、新四军的募捐更受到了国民党特务的无耻阻挠和公开破坏。在这种情况下，更扩大了保卫中国同盟的活动，给八路军、新四军的捐款来得更多了。在延安开办的国际和平医院，就是广州沦陷后由保卫中国同盟发起和接济的。著名侨领陈嘉庚、司徒美堂先生对协助保卫中国同盟也做了不少贡献。
    蒋介石用各种卑鄙的手段威胁保卫中国同盟，甚至通过英帝国主义和在香港的代理人进行恐吓和威胁。但是保卫中国同盟以加倍的努力回答了这些阴谋。在香港组织了多次的电影、戏剧等各种各样的义卖会进行筹款，支援了八路军、新四军、东江纵队以及各个游击部队。
    蒋介石还动员了驻重庆的英国大使来威胁宋庆龄先生，企图劝说她离开香港，放弃保卫中国同盟的工作。宋庆龄先生和他展开了一场激烈的争辩，英国大使才满面羞惭地走开了。
    皖南事件爆发后，宋庆龄先生严词谴责了蒋介石的罪恶行为，同时通过保卫中国同盟向全世界控诉了蒋介石摧残新四军和包围封锁八路军的罪行，取得了支持中国人民抗战的国际朋友和爱国侨胞的声援。
    保卫中国同盟还支援了当时香港的进步文化新闻事业。皖南事变后在香港出版的主张正义的华商报，就是由保卫中国同盟拨款举办的。
    保卫中国同盟还进行了支持抗战、反对倒退、反对投降的国际的抗日统一战线工作，它和美国、英国、澳大利亚、加拿大等地的援华会取得了密切联系，供给他们有关支援中国抗战和八路军、新四军活动的资料。
    短短的四年中，保卫中国同盟进行了不少工作。固然，八路军、新四军主要是依靠群众支持，依靠艰苦朴素作风，依靠缴获敌人的武器弹药和医药用品来解决困难的；但保卫中国同盟在侧面，在某些角落，是完成了它的任务，并起了一定的作用。
    我不禁回想起宋庆龄先生在那四年艰苦的岁月中，在亲友的责难、特务的恐吓、帝国主义殖民者的中伤破坏及蒋介石的威胁造谣下，怎样地进行了坚强不屈的工作。时间过得真快，已是二十年了，这二十年真是不平凡的二十年。我又不禁回忆起二十年前在香港宋庆龄先生住宅的一个小客厅里，由五六个人宣布保卫中国同盟成立时的情景，和1949年10月1日兴奋地在天安门上向千百万群众挥手的宋庆龄先生的欢乐心情。斗争总是一点一滴地进行的。唯有忘我地进行一点一滴的斗争的人，才能分享到自己的一份劳力在里面的伟大胜利的欢欣和兴奋。
