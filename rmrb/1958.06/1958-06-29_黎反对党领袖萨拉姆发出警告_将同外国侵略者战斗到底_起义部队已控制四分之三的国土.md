Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the Cairo newspaper "Al-Akhbar" published on the 28th a letter from Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam to the people of Arab countries. In his letter, he warned that if the UN observers are turned into an international police force, then the Lebanese people will consider this an act of aggression and resist it, just like resisting any other foreign aggression.

Salam's letter stated that if Western countries' troops land in Lebanon, the Lebanese people will resist them and fight them to the end. He said that the direct cause of the current popular uprising in Lebanon is the interference of Western countries in Lebanon's internal affairs through their embassies.

According to a Damascus report: Former Prime Minister Yafi, one of the leaders of the Lebanese opposition, said at a press conference held in Beirut on the 27th that the Lebanese rebel forces have now controlled three-quarters of the territory of Lebanon.

He said, "This is the foundation for establishing a revolutionary government." He also said, "The question of establishing a government is to choose the appropriate time."

It is reported that fierce battles broke out again on the 27th in many areas of Lebanon between the rebel forces and the Chamoun government's armed forces. The government forces once deployed modern weapons supplied by the imperialists, such as jet aircraft, heavy artillery, and armored vehicles, but the rebels continued to strike them hard.

In the capital Beirut, following the fierce fighting all night on the 26th, fighting continued in the Basta district on the 27th in the morning and afternoon, with machine gun fire and rifle fire resounding all day long. This was the most intense fighting in Beirut in two weeks.

In Tripoli, the second largest city, fierce fighting broke out in the urban area and suburbs on the 26th for several hours at night, and fierce fighting continued on the 27th.

The rebel forces in the northern Jabal Terbol area launched a fierce attack on the government forces' positions.

On the same day, fierce fighting also broke out in the Rashaya area of the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

    黎反对党领袖萨拉姆发出警告
    将同外国侵略者战斗到底
    起义部队已控制四分之三的国土
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：开罗“消息报”28日刊载了黎巴嫩反对党领袖、前总理萨拉姆告阿拉伯各国人民书。他在信中警告说，如果把联合国观察员变为国际警察部队，那么黎巴嫩人民就将认为这是侵略行为，并且予以抵抗，就像抵抗其他任何外国侵略一样。
    萨拉姆的信说，如果西方国家的军队在黎巴嫩登陆，黎巴嫩人民就将抵抗他们，并且同他们战斗到底。他说，黎巴嫩目前人民的起义的直接原因是西方国家通过它们的大使馆干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    据大马士革消息：黎巴嫩反对党领袖之一、前总理雅非27日在贝鲁特举行的记者招待会上说，黎巴嫩起义人民部队现在已经控制了黎巴嫩四分之三的领土。
    他说，“这是成立革命政府的基础”。他还说，“成立政府的问题是要选择适当的时间。”
    据报道，黎巴嫩许多地区在27日又爆发了起义部队和夏蒙政府武装力量之间的激烈战斗。政府部队曾经出动帝国主义者供应的喷气式飞机、重炮和装甲车等现代武器，但是起义者继续予以痛击。
    在首都贝鲁特，继26日彻夜激战以后，27日上下午在巴斯塔区继续发生战斗，机关枪声和步枪声整天不绝。这是两星期来贝鲁特发生的最激烈的战斗。
    在第二大城的黎波里市区和郊区，26日发生夜战几小时，27日又继续有激战。
    北部特包勒山区的起义部队向政府部队阵地发动了猛烈的进攻。
    同一天，黎巴嫩东部贝卡盆地的拉希亚地区也发生了激战。
