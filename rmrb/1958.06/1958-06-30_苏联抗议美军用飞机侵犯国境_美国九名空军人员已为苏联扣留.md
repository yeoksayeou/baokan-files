Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 29th: The Soviet government lodged a firm protest with the U.S. government on the 28th against the U.S. military aircraft's blatant violation of the Soviet border in the area south of Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The note firmly demanded that the U.S. government take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed over the note to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson yesterday.

The note stated that on June 27th, at 18:30 Moscow time, a four-engine military aircraft with U.S. Air Force markings crossed the Soviet border and intruded into Soviet airspace for 170 kilometers. Two Soviet fighter jets took off to instruct the U.S. aircraft to land. The intruding aircraft did not comply with this suggestion, and the Soviet fighter jets were forced to compel it to land. The aircraft landed and burned 240 kilometers from the point of the border violation.

After the intruding aircraft landed, nine crew members wearing U.S. military uniforms were detained. The confessions of these individuals and the documents they carried indicate that the detained personnel are all active-duty members of the U.S. Air Force.

The note emphasized that the facts prove that the intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into Soviet territory was a premeditated act.

The note recalled that similar incidents have occurred before, but the U.S. government has consistently denied the facts. The note stated that it appears the U.S. government will find it difficult to deny the U.S. military aircraft's violation of the Soviet border on June 27th.

    苏联抗议美军用飞机侵犯国境
    美国九名空军人员已为苏联扣留
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府28日照会美国政府，坚决抗议美国军用飞机粗暴地侵犯苏联亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温以南地区的边境。照会坚决要求美国政府采取有效措施制止再发生这类事件。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯已经在昨天把这项照会交给美国驻苏联大使汤普逊。
    照会说，6月27日莫斯科时间十八点三十分，一架带有美国空军标志的四引擎军用飞机越过苏联边境，侵入苏联领空达一百七十公里。两架苏联歼击机起飞，要这架美国飞机着陆。入侵飞机没有服从这一建议，于是苏联歼击机不得不强迫它着陆。这架飞机在距侵犯边境地点二百四十公里的地方着陆并焚毁。
    入侵飞机着陆以后，身穿美国军装的九名机上人员即被扣留。这些人的供认和他们所携带的证件表明，被扣留的人员都是美国空军现役人员。
    照会强调指出，事实证明，美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境是一种预谋的行为。
    照会追述说，以前也发生过类似事件，但是，美国政府不顾事实一直矢口否认。照会说，看来美国政府对美国军用飞机6月27日侵犯苏联国境一事将难以否认。
