The Smartest People
——Introducing New Members of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery

    Tang Xieneng Creates Slurry Injection Well Drilling Method

    Tang Xieneng, a farmer cadre who only attended private school for three years, successfully experimented with the "Slurry Injection Well Drilling Method," solving the problem of not being able to drill artesian wells on high ground, and opening up a new path for drilling artesian wells in the Leizhou Peninsula.

    Tang Xieneng is the well-drilling team leader in the suburbs of Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, 30 years old this year, and from Leidong County, with a farmer background. Before becoming a well-drilling team leader in 1955, he only underwent half a month of training. Over the past two years, he has led farmers to drill more than 480 artesian wells, freeing more than 20,000 mu of farmland from the threat of drought. He has transformed from a farmer who knew nothing about well-drilling technology into a "local expert" familiar with the complete set of well-drilling techniques. In 1954, the Leizhou Peninsula began drilling artesian wells. Initially, the masses chose low-lying areas to drill. By last year, after more than 4,000 wells had been drilled, they began moving towards higher ground. Because drilling was twice as deep as before, using the "Clear Water Well Drilling Method" resulted in shallower drills that were not usable in high-altitude areas. In November last year, based on several years of well-drilling experience, Tang Xieneng boldly experimented with the "Slurry Injection Well Drilling Method" in the Dongfang Agricultural Cooperative of Puzai Township in the suburbs, and achieved success, solving the problem of not being able to drill artesian wells in high ground. This well-drilling method has several advantages: it can drill deep, generally from 150 meters to 300 meters, the diameter is large, the water output is high, there is no need to lower casing, and it will not collapse, and the operation is simple. In the past, it took twelve people to drill a well, but now it only takes eight, greatly shortening working hours and saving costs. After the birth of this new well-drilling method, the Zhanjiang Special District Water Conservancy Bureau organized farmers from Leidong, Haikang, and the suburbs of Zhanjiang City to visit. At present, this new well-drilling method is being widely promoted throughout the Leizhou Peninsula.

    Cheng Jinru Creates a Hand-Operated Plate Bending Machine

    Cheng Jinru, a forging worker at the Xiaguan Agricultural Implement Factory in Yunnan Province, is from Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, and is 43 years old. He started working in factories at the age of thirteen. He used a pressure plate and some screws and tin to make a hand-operated plate bending machine, solving the factory's difficulty in making boilers due to the lack of a plate bending machine. In the past, this factory made boilers by hand, but now with the plate bending machine, the efficiency has increased three times, and the quality of the boilers has also improved. This hand-operated plate bending machine only cost 50 yuan. Cheng Jinru has also successively improved more than ten kinds of tools, saving the country thousands of yuan in wealth.

    Hu Xiuqing Creates the Derrick Soil Transport Method

    Hu Xiuqing, the supervisory director of the Taiping Agricultural Cooperative in Taiping Township, Jiashan County, Anhui Province, is 32 years old, from a poor peasant family, a demobilized soldier, a Communist Party member, and has a primary school education. This spring, he visited Bengbu to see new tools and was inspired to create the derrick soil transport method. Using this method to transport soil, one person's daily efficiency can reach 16 to 17 cubic meters, which is one to two times higher than the local general soil transport efficiency.

    Meng Zhaolin Creates a Sweet Potato Slicing Machine

    Meng Zhaolin, 48 years old, is a worker at the Chengguan Wood Industry Production Cooperative in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province. He studied carpentry from a young age and only attended primary school for three years. Last year, he and the workers in the cooperative jointly created a foot-operated fruit processing slicing machine. In April this year, many agricultural cooperatives expanded the planting area of ​​potatoes. Many agricultural cooperatives were worried that after a good harvest of potatoes in the future, they would suffer from mold and spoilage due to the lack of potato processing tools and storage experience. Seeing this situation, Meng Zhaolin and other technicians studied this issue together and immediately received the support of the cooperative's technical research committee. In the research process, he also received help from workers in the Chengguan Iron Industry, Agricultural Implement, Clock and Watch, and other handicraft cooperatives. Based on the principle of the fruit processing slicing machine, he worked hard for fifteen days, and after three trials and modifications, he finally successfully trial-produced the foot-operated potato processing slicing machine at the end of April. This slicing machine has sixteen blades and can slice 1,260 jin of potatoes per hour, which is thirty times more efficient than manual operation. The sliced ​​potato slices are neat and uniform. The cost of this slicing machine is extremely low and it is very popular among the masses. Zhang Hongcai Creates a Double-Wheel Foot-Operated Water Wheel

    Zhang Hongcai is 33 years old this year, an urban poor resident, with a primary school education, and a Communist Party member. He has been a carpenter since he was a child and is now the director of the Hongguang Woodware Cooperative in Bo County, Anhui Province. In April this year, he and his two assistants jointly created a double-wheel foot-operated water wheel. This type of water wheel can irrigate 8 to 10 mu of paddy fields per day, while ordinary water wheels can only irrigate 4 to 5 mu. Their created water wheel was exhibited at the agricultural exhibition in Fuyang Special District, Anhui Province, and has been promoted to about 300 units throughout the special district, with very good water pumping results.

    Xiang Guangzhang Creates a Rice Seeder

    Xiang Guangzhang, 41 years old this year, is a member of the Yuguan Agricultural Implement Cooperative in Wufeng County, Hubei Province, and an advanced agricultural implement producer in the province.

    In March this year, it was the rice transplanting season on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, farmers in the Wufeng County area were not transplanting rice, but scattering seeds by hand. People first drained the water from the paddy fields, then waded through the mud, scattering seeds handful by handful. The movement was very laborious, the work efficiency was not high, and the seeds often did not germinate in the mud for several days. The farmers said to Xiang Guangzhang: "It would be great if you could create a machine for us!" Xiang Guangzhang had long had this idea. When he returned to the agricultural implement cooperative, he discussed it with everyone, but no one had ever seen a seeder. Later, encouraged by the secretary of the Party branch, he discussed it with everyone again, drew up a drawing, and worked with three workers to trial-produce the first seeder. The first experiment failed. Based on the helpful suggestions of the old farmers, Xiang Guangzhang quickly made improvements and worked all night to transform it successfully.

    This rice seeder is operated by two people and looks like a small wooden handcart. Each unit can sow more than 10 mu per day, which is six to seven times more efficient than manual sowing, and the seeds sown are uniform and have a high survival rate.

    Xu Chuanquan Creates a Universal Tractor

    Xu Chuanquan, a technician at the Yuxi Special District Iron Factory in Yunnan Province, is from Shanghai and is 36 years old. Xu Chuanquan is an old worker who has been working on internal combustion engines for more than 20 years and was promoted to technician in 1957. He spent two months creating a steam tractor. This tractor can pull a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, a harvester, and a seeder. Its power can be used for rice milling, flour milling, cotton ginning, power generation, water pumping, and sawing wood. It can also drive a lathe. One of the characteristics of this universal tractor is that it can use any fuel.

    最聪明的人
    ——中国农业机械学会新吸收的会员的介绍
    唐协能创造灌泥浆打井法
    只读过三年私塾的农民干部唐协能，试验成功的“灌泥浆打井法”，解决了在高地上无法打自流井的难题，为雷州半岛打自流井开辟了新道路。
    唐协能是广东省湛江市郊区的打井队长，今年三十岁，雷东县人，农民出身。1955年他担任打井队长之前，只经过半个月的训练。两年多来，他领导农民打成了四百八十多眼自流井，使两万多亩农田解除了旱患的威胁，由一个完全不懂打井技术的农民变成一个熟悉全套打井技术的“土专家”。1954年，雷州半岛便开始打自流井。起初，群众都是选低洼的地方打井。到了去年，各地打了四千多眼井之后，便向高地进发。因为钻井要比以前深一倍，沿用“清水打井法”，钻的较浅，在地势高的地区，便不能使用。去年11月，唐协能根据几年来的打井经验在郊区铺仔乡东方农业社大胆试用“灌泥浆打井法”获得成功，解决了在高地无法打自流井的问题。这种打井法有几个好处：打得深，一般能打一百五十公尺到三百公尺，口径大，出水量多，不用下套管，也不会崩塌，操作简便。过去打一眼井需要十二个人，现在只要八个人就行了，大大缩短了工时和节约了费用。这个新的打井法诞生之后，湛江专区水利局即组织雷东、海康、湛江市郊区等地的农民前往参观。目前，雷州半岛各地正在普遍推行这种新的打井方法。
    程金如创造手摇弯板器
    云南省下关农具厂锻工程金如，江苏省江阴县人，四十三岁。他十三岁就到工厂做工。他用一块压板和一些螺钉、元锡做成了一部手摇弯板器，解决了这个厂做锅炉缺乏弯板器的困难。过去这个厂做锅炉都用手工敲，现在有了弯板器，提高工效三倍，并提高了锅炉的质量。这部手摇弯板器只花了五十元的成本。程金如还陆续改进了十多种工具，为国家节约了几千元财富。
    胡秀清创造吊杆运土法
    胡秀清，安徽嘉山县太平乡太平农业社的监察主任，三十二岁，贫农成份，转业军人，共产党员，高小文化程度。今年春天，他到蚌埠参观新工具，得到启发，因此创造了吊杆运土法。用这种方法运土，一个人一天工效可以达到十六到十七土方，比当地一般运土工效提高一倍到两倍。
    孟昭麟创造薯类切片机
    孟昭麟，四十八岁，山西省汾阳县城关木业生产合作社工人。他从小就学习木匠，仅上过三年小学。去年他和社内的工人们共同创造了脚踏水果加工切片机。今年4月间，许多农业社扩大山药蛋的种植面积，许多农业社担心将来山药蛋丰收以后，因缺乏薯类加工工具和保管经验，会发生霉烂现象。孟昭麟看到这种情况，就和张思亮等技术工人一起研究这个问题，立即得到这个社的技术研究委员会的支持。在研究过程中，他又得到城关铁业、农具、钟表等手工业社的工人们的帮助。他根据水果加工切片机的原理，苦战十五天，前后经过三次试验和修改，终于在4月底试制成功脚踏薯类加工切片机。这部切片机有十六把刀片，每小时可切山药蛋一千二百六十斤，比人工操作提高效率三十倍。切成的薯片整齐均匀。这部切片机的成本极低，很受群众欢迎。张洪彩创造双轮脚踏水车
    张洪彩今年三十三岁，城市贫民，高小文化程度，共产党员。他从小就当木工，现在是安徽省亳县红光木器社的主任。今年4月他同他的两个助手共同创造了双轮脚踏水车。这种水车，每部一天可以灌八亩至十亩水田，而一般水车只能灌四亩至五亩。他们创造的这种水车，在安徽省阜阳专区的农业展览会上展出后，已经在全专区推广了约三百多部，车水效果很好。
    向光章创造水稻播种机
    向光章，今年四十一岁，是湖北省五峰县渔关农具社社员，省的农具先进生产者。
    今年3月里，正是长江南岸的插秧季节。可是五峰县一带的农民不是插秧，而是用手撒种。人们首先放干了稻田的水，然后跋涉在稀泥里，一把一把地撒种子，动作非常吃力，工效不高，而且种子在稀泥里往往好几天不发芽。农民对向光章说：“你能给我们创造一种机器就好了！”向光章早也就有这份心思。回到农具社里，他便和大伙研究，可是谁都没有见过播种机。后来在党支部书记的鼓励下，他又和大家商量，东比西划绘起一份图样来，并且和三个工人一起研究，试制出了第一部播种机。第一次试验失败了。根据老农民有益的建议，向光章连忙进行改进，熬了一整夜改造成功了。
    这种水稻播种机由两个人操作，就像个小型木制手推车，每部一天可播种十亩多，比人工用手撒种的效率提高六倍到七倍，而且播下的种子均匀，成活率很高。
    徐川泉创造万能拖拉机
    云南省玉溪专区铁工厂技术员徐川泉，上海人，三十六岁。徐川泉是一个做了二十多年内燃机的老工人，1957年被提拔为技术员。他以两个月的时间创造发明了蒸汽拖拉机。这种拖拉机可以牵引双轮双铧犁、收割机、播种机。它的动力可以用作碾米、磨面、轧花、发电、抽水、锯木，也可以带动车床转动。这种万能拖拉机的特点之一是可以用任何燃料。
