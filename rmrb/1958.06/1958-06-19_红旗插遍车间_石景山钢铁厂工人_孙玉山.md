    Red Flags Planted All Over the Workshop
    Sun Yushan, Worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    It has been a year since Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was published. In this short year alone, this theoretical work has guided all our work, causing tremendous changes in the entire social landscape. Under the guidance of this theoretical work, we launched a nationwide rectification campaign. The victorious progress of the rectification campaign has unprecedentedly improved the relationship between people and broken the superstitions of many. Chairman Mao's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is related to everyone.

    Looking at the situation in our factory, since the rectification, our factory has produced millions of big-character posters. Through mass airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, the relationship between leaders and the led has become closer. The Party Secretary regularly participates in labor and reads newspapers to the workers to explain the situation, thus greatly improving the workers' thinking. The leaders also feel that they have gained something, saying that they couldn't find their way in the past, but now that they have gone down to the workshop, it is much better than before. The contradictions between workers and leaders are decreasing, workers are actively seeking help from leaders, and leaders are also actively coming down to ask veteran workers for advice, which benefits both sides.

    Currently, our factory is undergoing major construction. Originally, it was planned to build a medium-sized joint enterprise in ten years, but under the encouragement of the General Line, the workers are particularly enthusiastic. The ten-year plan has been leaped forward to be completed in four years, without increasing investment. On this basis, the workers have leapt forward again and again. After six leaps forward, the construction plan has been leapt forward from completion in four years to completion in two and a half years. The original annual production was 600,000 tons of steel, but now it has leapt forward to 1.3 million tons. Our coking workshop's metallurgical coke has increased from the original 451,000 tons to 492,000 tons after four leaps forward. One coke oven has a horizontal flue and is a semi-handicraft coke oven. It has been proposed to automate it, and it will be completed soon. The chemical workshop has successfully trial-produced "germanium," which is used in the most advanced communication equipment. This material is more precious than gold. In the process of successful trial production, we did not rely on any technical data or advanced equipment, but only relied on good combination of labor and technology, and sufficient enthusiasm. In terms of coke quality, the original coke ash content was above 12, but now it has reached more than 9, and it will soon reach the most advanced international level.

    The correct handling of contradictions among the people has fully promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Through skills competitions, we and the technicians discussed together and successfully solved the problem of using asphalt to make coke. This kind of coke can be used for making electrodes, smelting lead, and other purposes.

    In the past, workshop technicians relied entirely on theory and did not combine well with the workers, so solving problems was not very practical. Now, after directly participating in production labor, the technicians feel the importance of combining theory with practice, and also feel that the workers' experience is the richest.

    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, people's minds have also been liberated. After hard work, the workers have been able to produce electric welding machines. Moreover, the quality of this electric welding machine has caught up with that of foreign countries. We also plan to build our own motors in the future. Diesel fuel has also been made. Now cadres spend half their time laboring and half in the office, and workers not only labor but also participate in management. Workers and cadres are advancing side by side. The workers' enthusiasm is not forced, but naturally formed. Our slogans are: Revolutionary enthusiasm soars to the sky, ash content leads the country; improve technical equipment, everyone contributes ideas; quadruple the variety, increase coke by another six thousand; everyone studies culture, everyone is both civilized and martial; make a big fuss about technical revolution, red flags planted all over the workshop.

    红旗插遍车间
    石景山钢铁厂工人　孙玉山
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一年了。仅在这短短的一年的时间内，这个理论著作指导了我们的一切工作，使整个社会面貌起了巨大的变化。在这个理论著作的指导下，我们开展了全民的整风运动。整风运动的胜利进行，空前地改善了人和人之间的关系，也破除了许多人的迷信。毛主席关于正确处理人民矛盾的理论，是和所有的人都有关系的。
    就从我们厂子的情况来看，整风以来，我们的工厂出了百万张大字报。通过大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报，领导与被领导之间的关系更加密切了。党委书记按期参加劳动，为工人读报讲解形势，因此，工人思想有了很大的提高。领导也觉得有收获，说过去工作摸不着门路，现在下了车间就比过去好多了。工人与领导的矛盾在减少，工人主动向领导求援，领导也主动下来向老工人请教，这使两方面都获益不少。
    现在，我们的工厂正在进行大建设。本来计划十年建成一个中型的联合企业，但是，在总路线的鼓舞下，工人干劲特别足，十年规划跃进到四年完成，投资没有增加。在这个基础上，工人跃进又跃进。经过了六次跃进，建设计划又由四年完成跃进到两年半完成。原来年生产到六十万吨钢，现在跃进到一百三十万吨。我们焦化车间冶金焦已由原来的四十五万一千吨，经过四次跃进，达到四十九万二千吨。一焦炉是水平火道，是半手工业焦炉，这次提出来要自动化，最近即可完成。化工车间已经试制成功发展最先进通讯设备所用的“锗”，这种东西比黄金还贵重。在试制成功的过程中，我们并没有依靠什么技术资料和先进设备，而只是依靠劳技结合好，干劲足。在焦炭质量方面，原来焦炭灰份是十二以上，现已达到九点多，即将达到国际最先进水平。
    人民内部矛盾的正确处理，充分地发扬了群众的积极性和创造性。通过比武大会，我们和技术人员共同商量，成功地解决了用沥青炼焦的问题。这种焦可以作制电极、炼铅等用途。
    过去，车间技术员全凭理论办事，和工人结合得不好，因此，解决问题就不大结合实际。现在，技术员在直接参加生产劳动后，感觉理论结合实际的重要性，也感觉工人的经验是最丰富的。
    在毛主席思想的指导下，人们的思想也得到了解放。工人经过刻苦钻研，已能搞出电焊机。并且，这种电焊机的质量已赶上了外国。我们今后还准备自造马达。柴油也已做出来了。现在干部是一半劳动，一半在办公室，工人不仅劳动，也参加了管理。工人和干部并肩前进。工人的干劲不是强迫的，是自然形成的。我们的口号是：革命干劲冲天，灰份全国领先；改进技术设备，人人都把计献；品种增加四倍，焦炭再增六千；人人学习文化，个个文武双全；大闹技术革命，红旗插遍车间。
