Promote Indigenous Methods for Manufacturing High-Grade Cement
Henan Builds Cement Plants on a Large Scale to Strive for Self-Sufficiency

(Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 16th dispatch) Reporter Lu Xiaoping reports: Henan is vigorously promoting the experience of peasants in Zhuge Township, Yanshi County, in creating high-grade cement using indigenous methods. In just over a month, more than 400 cement plants with annual production capacities ranging from several hundred to two thousand tons have been built or are about to be completed.

This year, various construction projects in Henan Province require hundreds of thousands of tons of high-grade cement, of which the state can only supply a portion. Furthermore, the lime-clay cement made by local methods in the past was only suitable for general water conservancy construction projects. Many significant industrial and transportation construction projects could not start on time due to the lack of high-grade cement. At the same time, the coal industry, lacking sufficient timber for mine supports and unable to replace them with metal supports, could not increase production as desired. If cement were available, concrete could be used for supports. However, the manufacturing of high-grade cement has always been considered the domain of modern cement plants.

The peasants Ma Yongrui, Ma Faxi, and Ma Zhangming of Zhuge Township, Yanshi County, produced high-grade cement using handicraft methods, creating a precedent for mass production of this cement in various regions. After painstaking research, they used one hundred jin of chalky soil, mixed with fifteen jin of anthracite coal and four to eight jin of red clay, made into small balls, and burned in a self-built vertical furnace. After adding some gypsum and grinding, it became cement with a grade of 400 or higher. Moreover, building such a vertical furnace with a daily output of six tons of cement requires an investment of only about 3,000 yuan, can be completed in one month, and the operating technology can be learned in half a month.

However, the manufacturing of cement in Zhuge Township is entirely manual, requiring a relatively large amount of labor and animal power. The cost of each ton of cement is as high as about 70 yuan. Therefore, when promoting the experience of this township, relevant departments in Henan Province decided to try to supply various regions with some simple, small-scale mechanical equipment, such as using a locomotive boiler to drive a double-roller iron mill for fine powder processing. In this way, building a factory of the same scale as the Zhuge Township cement plant requires an investment of about 30,000 yuan, and the cost of each ton of cement can be reduced to about 50 yuan. Since the manufacturing of this equipment takes time, various regions, unable to wait, mobilized the masses to solve the problem. For example, Wuliang Township in Yu County created an automatic blowing furnace and a double-roller fast mill, requiring only four to six laborers to complete the crushing of raw materials and semi-finished products for a daily output of six tons of cement. Currently, in addition to a batch of small cement plants that have been built and are under construction in townships and communes throughout Henan, more than 40 cement plants with annual production capacities ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 tons or more are being planned by the special districts and counties and will soon begin construction. After these plants are all completed this year, they can produce more than one million tons of high-grade cement annually. At that time, Henan Province can solve its own needs for all but some special types of cement.

### 推广土办法造高标号水泥  河南大建水泥厂争取自给

    推广土办法造高标号水泥
    河南大建水泥厂争取自给
    本报郑州16日电　记者陆笑萍报道：河南各地大力推广偃师县诸葛乡农民创造的土制高标号水泥的经验，在一个多月里建成和即将建成的年产几百吨到两千吨的水泥厂已达四百多座。
    今年河南省各种建筑工程需要好几十万吨高标号水泥，国家只能供应一部分；而前些时候，各地用土法制成的石灰烧粘土水泥，又只适用于一般水利建筑工程。不少工业、交通方面的重大建设工程，曾因没有高标号水泥而不能按时开工。同时，煤炭工业因没有足够的木材做坑木支柱，又不能以金属支柱来代替，无法如愿地增产。如果有了水泥，就可以用混凝土做支柱。可是，对于制造高标号水泥，各地一向认为这是现代化水泥厂办的事。
    偃师县诸葛乡农民马永瑞、马发喜、马章明等人用手工业制出高标号水泥，为各地大量制造这种水泥创造了先例。他们经过苦心研究，用一百斤白垩土，配上十五斤无烟煤和四至八斤红粘土，制成小球放在自造的直立炉里烧炼后，再加上一些石膏，碾碎了就成为水泥，标号达到四百号以上，而且建设这样一座日产六吨水泥的直立炉，投资只需三千元左右，一个月就可建成，半个月便能学会操作技术。
    但是，诸葛乡制造水泥全是手工作业，用劳力和畜力比较多。每吨水泥成本高到七十元左右。因此，河南省有关部门在推广这个乡的经验时，便决定设法供应各地一些简单的小型的机械设备。如以锅驼机带动双磙铁碾做粉细工作，等等。这样建设一座和诸葛乡水泥厂规模相同的厂，投资约三万元，每吨水泥的成本可降到五十元左右。由于这些设备的制造需要一段时间，各地等不及，就发动群众来解决。如禹县无良乡创造出一种自动吹风炉和双磙快碾，只需四至六个劳动力就可以完成日产六吨水泥的原料和半成品的粉碎工作。现在，河南各地除乡、社已经建成和正在建设的一批小型水泥厂以外，专、县正在筹建的四十多座年产五千吨到三万吨以上的水泥厂，也即将动工。这些厂在今年全部建成后，可以年产高标号水泥一百多万吨。那时河南省除一部分特种水泥以外，其它的自己都可以解决。
