Dulles to Meet with De Gaulle
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: The U.S. State Department announced on the 11th that Secretary of State Dulles will visit Paris on July 5th to hold talks with the new French Premier De Gaulle.

Originally, there were reports that the U.S. government had intended to invite De Gaulle to Washington to meet with Eisenhower. However, De Gaulle, through a French Foreign Ministry spokesperson on the 10th of this month, stated that due to “busy domestic affairs,” he would be unable to spare time to visit abroad in the “near future.”

The French Foreign Ministry spokesperson revealed on the same day that Dulles's visit to Paris was "suggested" by Eisenhower for De Gaulle to invite. According to the Associated Press on the 12th, quoting Washington officials, Dulles is going to Paris to "personally understand De Gaulle's views on a range of issues from the North African situation to East-West summit talks," and at the same time, he also wants to let De Gaulle know what kind of "support" the United States can give him.

    彼此拉拢　互相摸底
    杜勒斯将同戴高乐会谈
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院11日宣布，国务卿杜勒斯将在7月5日访问巴黎，同法国新总理戴高乐举行会谈。
    原先有消息说，美国政府曾经打算请戴高乐到华盛顿去，同艾森豪威尔会晤。但是戴高乐本月10日通过法国外交部发言人表示，由于国内“政务繁忙”，他在“最近的将来”不可能抽身出国访问。
    法国外交部发言人同一天透露，杜勒斯这次去巴黎访问是由艾森豪威尔“建议”戴高乐邀请的。据美联社12日引用华盛顿官员的话说，杜勒斯去巴黎是为了要“亲自了解戴高乐对从北非局势一直到东西方最高级会谈等一系列问题的看法”，同时他也要让戴高乐知道美国可能给他“什么样的支持”。
