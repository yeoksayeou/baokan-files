Small Facts

    Large-scale sheep improvement in Inner Mongolia is an important way to solve the current shortage of raw materials for China's wool textile industry. Inner Mongolia has more than 10 million sheep, accounting for one-fifth of the country's total number of sheep. However, in the past, wool production was low and the quality was poor, which was not suitable for the rapid development of China's wool textile industry. After large-scale sheep improvement, it is expected that more than 20 million kilograms of improved wool will be produced by 1962.

    Inner Mongolia has improved more than 250,000 sheep in the past seven years. The wool production of these improved sheep has significantly exceeded that of local sheep. According to a survey in the Zhaowuda League, ordinary Mongolian sheep produce 3.66 jin of wool per year, but first-generation hybrid sheep after improvement can produce 5.48 jin of wool per year, second-generation hybrid sheep can produce 6.6 jin of wool per year, and high-generation hybrid sheep can produce up to 15 jin of wool per year, and the quality of the wool is also very good.

    改良绵羊的好处
    内蒙古大规模改良绵羊，是解决我国目前毛纺工业原料缺乏的重要途径。内蒙古现有绵羊一千多万只，占全国绵羊总数的五分之一。但过去羊毛产量少，质量低，不适合我国毛纺工业迅速发展的要求。大规模改良绵羊后，预计到1962年将出产改良羊毛二千多万公斤。
    内蒙古在过去七年中已改良了绵羊二十五万多只。这些改良羊的产毛量都显著地超过本地羊。根据昭乌达盟调查，一般蒙古羊年产毛三点六六斤，但改良后的一代杂种羊，每年能产毛五点四八斤，二代杂种羊每年能产毛六点六斤，高代杂种羊每年产毛量最高的达十五斤，毛的质量也很好。
