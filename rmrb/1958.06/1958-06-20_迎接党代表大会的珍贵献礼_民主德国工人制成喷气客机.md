    A Precious Gift to Greet the Party Congress
    East German Workers Manufacture Jet Airliner

    (Our Dispatch) The first "152" type turbojet airliner has been manufactured in the German Democratic Republic. (See the picture on the right below.) This is a precious gift from the German working class to greet the Fifth National Congress of the Socialist Unity Party. This jet airliner has undergone ground tests, and its performance is excellent. Preparations for its test flight are actively underway. From now on, after the Soviet Union, there will be a second country in the socialist camp capable of producing jet airliners. This marks a great leap forward in the Democratic German aviation industry.

    The "152" type jet airliner is a medium-range aircraft with a speed of 800 kilometers per hour and can fly at an altitude of 10,000 to 12,000 meters. Its main advantages are:

    First, the engines are installed on top of the landing gear, not on the wings, which not only reduces vibration to the fuselage and noise in the cabin, but also allows for replacement when better engines are made in the future, without affecting the entire fuselage.

    Second, it can take off on ordinary runways (1,300 to 1,500 meters long and 45 meters wide) without the need for special runways. Therefore, ordinary airports can be used.

    Third, fuel consumption is very low.

    The "152" type jet airliner has three types of cabins with forty-eight, fifty-seven, and seventy-two seats. The cabin can maintain a certain air pressure and temperature, and the ventilation equipment is excellent. It is also equipped with all kinds of new radio equipment and safety devices, such as radar, blind flight, de-icing, and automatic fire extinguishing equipment.

    The "152" type jet airliner was designed by the Democratic Germany itself. The Soviet Union provided selfless assistance, providing technical data, precision instruments, advanced materials, and valuable experience.

    迎接党代表大会的珍贵献礼
    民主德国工人制成喷气客机
    本报讯　第一架“一五二”型涡轮喷气客机，已经在德意志民主共和国制成。（见右下图）这是德国工人阶级为迎接统一社会党的第五次全国代表大会的珍贵献礼。这架喷气客机，已经过地面试验，性能良好，正在积极准备试飞。从此，社会主义阵营国家中，继苏联之后，已经有第二个国家能够生产喷气客机。这标志着民主德国航空工业的大跃进。
    “一五二”型喷气客机，是中距离航程的飞机，时速八百公里，可以航行在一万到一万二千公尺的高空。它的主要优点是：
    第一，发动机安装在机轮上部，不是安装在机翼上，不但可以减少对机身的震动和机舱里的噪音，并且在将来造出更好的发动机的时候，可以更换，不影响整个机身。
    第二，在普通跑道上（长一千三百公尺到一千五百公尺，宽四十五公尺）就能起飞，不用特殊的跑道。因之，可以利用普通机场。
    第三，耗油量很小。
    “一五二”型喷气客机的座舱，有四十八、五十七、七十二个座位的三种。机舱内能保持一定的气压和温度，通风设备良好。还装有一切新式的无线电设备和安全装置，如雷达、盲目飞行、消冰、自动灭火等设备。
    “一五二”型喷气客机，是民主德国自己设计的，苏联曾给予了无私的帮助，提供了技术资料、精密仪器、高级材料和宝贵的经验。
