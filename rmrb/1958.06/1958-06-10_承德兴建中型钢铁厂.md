Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Construction of the Chengde Steel Plant recently commenced. This is the fourth medium-sized steel plant to be built in Hebei Province, following the commencement of construction on the Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Xuanhua steel plants. When fully completed in 1962, this plant will be able to produce 600,000 to 750,000 tons of iron and 500,000 to 600,000 tons of steel annually, as well as various types of steel products.

The Chengde region of Hebei Province is rich in iron and coal reserves, which have been little exploited in the past. The construction of this medium-sized steel plant will create favorable conditions for the development of the machinery industry and the mechanization of agricultural production in the Chengde region. At the same time, this plant will also produce a large amount of coke, which, in addition to supplying the ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling production systems, can also produce various chemical products such as tar, ammonium sulfide, and benzene, supplying the chemical fertilizer, building materials, and other industrial production as raw materials.

　　承德兴建中型钢铁厂
    据新华社天津讯　承德钢铁厂最近动工兴建。这是河北省继邯郸、石家庄、宣化三座钢铁厂动工以后兴建的第四座中型钢铁厂。这个厂到1962年全部建成，每年可以生产六十到七十五万吨铁，五十到六十万吨钢，还生产各种钢材。
    河北省承德地区铁和煤的蕴藏量很丰富，过去很少开采。这个中型钢铁厂的兴建，将为承德地区的机械工业发展和农业生产机械化创造有利条件。同时，这个厂还将生产大量焦炭，除了供给炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等生产系统以外，还可以生产焦油、硫氨、粗苯等多种化学产品，供给化学肥料、建筑材料等工业生产作原料。
