　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Damascus newspapers reported on the 23rd that the rebel people of Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, once again repelled a fierce attack by the pro-Western government forces on the 22nd, firmly holding their controlled areas.

　　Government forces had used heavy artillery to bombard the areas controlled by the rebel people and attempted to occupy them, but as with many offensives over the past month, they failed again.

　　Following several explosions in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, on the 22nd, the Chamoun government arrested a large number of communists, insisting they were responsible for those explosions.

　　The Voice of Free Lebanon radio, in its broadcast on the evening of the 22nd, exposed Chamoun's new conspiracy to borrow troops from foreign countries. The broadcast stated that the headquarters of the Lebanese People's Forces, in a letter to the Iraq Petroleum Company, revealed that Chamoun's armed forces were scheming to fight the People's Forces in the suburb of Minya near Tripoli in order to request foreign intervention under the pretext of protecting foreign property. The Iraq Petroleum Company, mainly American and British capital, has an oil pipeline from Kirkuk, Iraq, to Tripoli.

　　TASS, Washington, 21st: An article by Pearson published in the "Washington Post and Times Herald" revealed that the US Air Force "C-124" transport planes are on standby in West Germany, ready to transport Turkish and Iraqi troops to Lebanon.

　　Pearson also wrote: "If Turkish and Iraqi troops are not enough, then British paratroopers and US Marines will land."

　　According to a report by Noel Barber, a reporter for the British "Daily Mail," from the 60,000-ton aircraft carrier "Saratoga" of the US Sixth Fleet near Rhodes, under a joint tactical plan, an unprecedentedly large British and American naval force is gathering in the Eastern Mediterranean, ready to intervene in Lebanon at any time. These forces include more than eighty British and American warships, led by three American aircraft carriers carrying two hundred jet aircraft and the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal."

　　Barber said that US troops with two reinforced battalions of Marines would make an amphibious landing, entering the city of Beirut from the port.

　　Britain will probably send paratroopers to land in order to control the airport five miles from Beirut.

　　He also said that if Lebanese President Chamoun feels that requesting Western aid is too dangerous, then the Sixth Fleet can sail into Beirut without firing a shot to "rescue" the American僑 (Qiao - overseas Chinese) in Lebanon.

　　London's "Reynold News" on the 22nd condemned Britain and the United States' plans for armed intervention in Lebanon as "Mediterranean Madness" and accused Britain of following the United States and not pursuing its own independent policy. The newspaper said that the most dangerous factor in the Middle East is that the United States is eager to intervene in Lebanon. "Mr. Dulles wants his own Suez Canal (war), and no matter what (war) brinkmanship operations Dulles may order, Britain is hanging on to his coattails in these actions."

    一个多月来连续粉碎政府军攻势
    的黎波里起义者坚不可摧
    美报透露美国打算驱遣土伊两国军队打头阵
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：大马士革报纸23日报道，黎巴嫩第二大城的黎波里起义人民在22日再度击退亲西方政府的部队的一次猛烈进攻，坚守住他们的控制地区。
    政府部队曾经使用重炮向起义人民控制地区轰击，并且企图进占，但是结果，像一个多月来的多次进攻一样，他们又失败了。
    黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特几个地方在22日发生爆炸事件以后，夏蒙政府逮捕了大批共产党人，硬说他们应对那些爆炸事件负责。
    自由黎巴嫩之声电台在22日晚上的广播中，揭露了夏蒙向外国借兵的新阴谋。广播说，黎巴嫩人民部队总部在给伊拉克石油公司的一封信中揭露，夏蒙的武装力量计谋在的黎波里附近的米尼亚郊区同人民部队作战，以便在保护外国财产的借口下，要求外国干涉。伊拉克石油公司主要是美国和英国的资本，它有一条输油管从伊拉克的基尔库克通到的黎波里。
    据塔斯社华盛顿21日讯：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”刊登的皮尔逊的一篇文章透露，美国空军“C—124型”运输飞机正在西德待命，准备把土耳其和伊拉克的军队运到黎巴嫩去。
    皮尔逊又写道：“如果土耳其和伊拉克军队不够，那么，英国伞兵和美国海军陆战队就将登陆。”
    另据英国“每日邮报”记者诺厄尔·巴伯尔自罗得岛附近美国第六舰队的六万吨航空母舰“萨拉托加号”上报道说，在联合战术计划下，空前庞大的英美海军部队正集结在东地中海中，准备随时出动干涉黎巴嫩。这些部队包括八十多艘英美军舰，为首的是载有二百架喷气式飞机的三艘美国航空母舰和英国“皇家方舟号”航空母舰。
    巴伯尔说，拥有两个加强营的海军陆战队的美军将作两栖登陆，从港口进入贝鲁特市。
    英国大概将派伞兵降落，以控制距贝鲁特市五英里的飞机场。
    他又说，如果黎巴嫩总统夏蒙觉得要求西方援助的作法太危险，那么，第六舰队就可以一枪不放地驶入贝鲁特，去“营救”在黎巴嫩的美侨。
    伦敦“雷诺新闻”22日谴责英国和美国打算在黎巴嫩进行武装干涉是“地中海的疯狂”，并且指责英国追随美国而不奉行自己的独立政策。报纸说，中东最危险的因素是，美国渴望着干涉黎巴嫩。“杜勒斯先生希望来一个他自己的苏伊士运河（战争），而不论杜勒斯可能下命令搞些甚么（战争）边缘派行动，在这些行动中英国都挂在他的衣襟后边。”
