The Most Intelligent People
——Materials on the 36 New Members Admitted to the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery

	Sun Fengqian Creates Hand-Operated Water Pump
	The waterwheel created by Sun Fengqian is mostly made of wood and is called a wooden hand-operated water pump. Sun Fengqian is 45 years old this year and is a carpenter from the Jian Guo No. 8 Cooperative of Yanji Township, Bo County, Anhui Province. He comes from a poor peasant family and did not attend school before liberation. He is a person who constantly uses his brain. During the large-scale water conservancy project, one day when he was cooking, he used a bellows to blow air. It suddenly occurred to him that if a bellows could produce air with a shake, it must be able to suck air. If it can suck air, it must be able to suck water, and if it can suck water, it must be able to discharge water. So he wanted to use the principle of the bellows to make a waterwheel.
	The cooperative director strongly supported his idea. He worked for eight days and eight nights in a row. On the eighth night, at 11 o'clock, he finished the water pump, but the secret test didn't work. Later, he discovered some shortcomings. For example, he thought that the gears of an electric fan are slanted, while the water paddles of his water pump are straight, so he changed them to slanted. After several improvements like this, the hand-operated water pump started pumping water.
	This waterwheel pumps twice as much water as an ordinary dragon-head well and saves half the labor.

	Yang Shouyi Creates a Carousel-Type Earth Transporter
	Yang Shouyi, the 29-year-old director of the Xinhui Agricultural Cooperative in Zhao Ji Township, Funan County, Anhui Province, comes from a poor peasant family. He and cooperative member Zhang Zhipin created a carousel-type earth transporter.
	This year, Xinhui Cooperative's rice improvement task is one thousand mu, requiring 570,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Each person needs to dig an average of ten cubic meters per day to complete the task. But at the beginning, even with a rush from 6 am to 12 pm, each person averaged only one and a half cubic meters per day. Yang Shouyi used his brain. He thought, since a carousel can carry wooden horses, can it carry earth? He first used firewood to gesture, and then used wooden poles and bamboo poles to experiment beside the reed ditch. At first, they were afraid of being laughed at, so they hid in the reed pit and used meal times and evenings to try it out. After three days, they met with the masses. But it still didn't work when installed in the field. They continued to improve it and finally succeeded. This carousel-type earth transporter is operated by eight people. After becoming proficient, each person averages 12.3 cubic meters of earth per day. Efficiency has increased six to eight times. Due to this creation, the irrigation area of Xinhui Cooperative has expanded. The original plan was 30%-40%, now it can reach 60%-70%.

	Wei Li Creates a Multi-Functional Seeder
	Wei Li, a working cadre of the Agricultural Technology Section of Hanggin Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia, is a young student who has studied in high school for one year. He created a multi-functional seeder. This work started in the summer of 1953, and he did it in his spare time. By 1957, it was basically successful. It can sow seeds, fertilize, and cultivate land, increasing work efficiency five to six times. Later, he installed arrow-shaped hoe teeth, hilling devices, and soil-crushing teeth, so he could do nine kinds of farm work.
	In the winter of 1957, he also modified the disc seeder to fertilize while sowing. Now more than 500 machines in the whole banner have been modified. Zhang Yusheng Creates a Horse-Drawn Four-Box Waterwheel

	Zhang Yusheng, who has an elementary school education and is in his twenties, is the director of the Shenghua Agricultural Cooperative in Santazhi Township, Futang District, Anhui Province, and a Communist Party member. There is no rice and no waterwheels here. Using water dippers to irrigate the land, two people can only irrigate a little over one mu a day. When promoting large-scale rice cultivation and building water conservancy projects, they encountered tool problems. After Zhang Yusheng came up with a solution, he created the "One-Wheel Horse-Drawn Four-Box Waterwheel." The amount of water lifted is one and a half times greater than that of a 15-horsepower diesel engine. The One-Wheel Horse-Drawn Four-Box Waterwheel has a great effect on "transforming Huaibei into Jiangnan."

	Xia Wanyou Creates an Aerial Earth Transporter
	Xia Wanyou, 34 years old, of the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Daihe Township, Huoshan County, Anhui Province, comes from a poor peasant family and has been a cowherd since childhood. After joining the People's Liberation Army after liberation, he began to learn culture. After being demobilized, he participated in agricultural production. When advancing into Tibet and crossing the Jinsha River, he saw wooden stakes driven on both sides of the river with bamboo cables pulled in the middle, and people sliding across from above. In the Great Leap Forward in production, with the help of the bamboo craftsman Xu Weiming and the cooperation of many people, he created the "Automated Aerial Earth Transporter." Operated by eight people, one day's work is equivalent to the amount of work done by one hundred and eighteen people in one day. (To be continued) (Attached photo)

    最聪明的人
    ——中国农业机械学会新吸收的36个会员的材料
    孙凤钱创造手摇抽水机
    孙凤钱所创造的水车，绝大部分用的是木料，叫做木制手摇抽水机。孙凤钱今年四十五岁，是安徽省亳县颜集乡建国八社的木工，贫农出身，解放前没上过学。他是一个经常动脑筋的人。在大修水利当中，有一天他做饭，利用风箱鼓风，他猛的想起风箱一摇就出风，能出风必定能吸风，能吸风也一定能吸水，而能吸水也一定能出水。于是他就想利用风箱原理来制造水车。
    社主任很支持他这个想法。他一连干了八天八夜。在第八天夜里十一点他把抽水机做好了，可是偷着试验，不动。后来，他发觉了一些缺点，比如他想到，电风扇的齿子是斜的，而他的抽水机的打水板是直的，于是他改成了斜的。这样作了几个改进，手摇抽水机抽出水来了。
    这水车比一般龙首水井抽水量多一倍，劳力省一半。
    杨守义创造转马式运土器
    安徽省阜南县赵集乡新辉农业社主任杨守义，二十九岁，贫农出身，他和社员张志品创造了转马式运土器。
    新辉社今年稻改任务是一千亩，需要挖土方五十七万。每人每天要平均挖十立方，才能完成任务。但是开始时，每天从早六点到晚十二点的突击，每人每天才平均一立方半。杨守义动了脑筋，他想转马这东西既然能带木马，带土行不行呢？他先用木柴比划，后用木杆、竹竿等在苇沟旁实验。起初，他们怕别人笑话，钻在苇坑内利用吃饭和晚上时间，试了三天以后，才和群众见面。但安到地里还是不行，他们继续改进，后来搞成功了。这种转马式运土器由八人操作，熟练后每人每日平均运土十二点三立方。效率提高了六到八倍，由于这一创造，新辉社的灌溉面积扩大了，原计划30％—40％，现在可以达到60％—70％。
    卫立创造多能式播种机
    内蒙古杭锦后旗农业技术科的工作干部卫立，是个读过一年高中的青年学生。他创造了多能式播种机。这工作从1953年夏天开始，他都是抽业余时间进行的，到1957年基本成功，可以播种、施肥、整地，工作效率提高五到六倍。后来他又安上箭形锄齿、培土器、碎土齿，就可以干九种农活了。
    1957年冬，他又改装了圆盘播种机，使它在播种同时施肥。现在全旗五百多台都进行了改装。张玉生创造马拉四箱水车
    张玉生，高小文化程度，二十多岁，是安徽省阜南县许堂区三塔乡盛华农业社主任，共产党员。他们这里没有水稻，也没有水车，用水斗浇地两人一天只浇一亩多。推广大面积水稻，大兴水利时，碰到了工具问题。经过张玉生想办法，创造了“一轮马拉四箱水车”。提水量比十五马力柴油机出水量还大一倍半。一轮马拉四箱水车对“淮北变江南”作用很大。
    夏万友创造空中运土器
    安徽省霍山县戴河乡幸福农业社的夏万友，三十四岁，贫农出身，从小放牛。解放后参加人民解放军后，才开始学文化，复员后参加农业生产。他在进军西藏过金沙江时，在江两岸看到打上木桩中间拉竹缆，人从上边滑过去。在生产大跃进中，在篾工徐维明的帮助下和许多人合作，创造了“自动化空中运土器”，用八个人操作，一天的工作量相等于一百一十八人操作一天的工作量。　（续一）（附图片）
