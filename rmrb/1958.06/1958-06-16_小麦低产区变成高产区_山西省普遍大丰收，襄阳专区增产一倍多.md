Low-Yielding Wheat Areas Transformed into High-Yielding Areas
Shanxi Province Achieves Universal Bumper Harvest, Xiangyang Prefecture Increases Production by More Than Double

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 15th dispatch) Reporter Feng Jianwei, Wu Zanting reported: Shanxi Province, historically a low-yielding wheat area, has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat this year. It is estimated that the total wheat output of the province will reach approximately 3 billion jin, exceeding the original Great Leap Forward plan by 11%, exceeding last year's total output by 68%, and exceeding the bumper harvest of 1956 by 23%.

Shanxi Province's wheat-producing areas are dispersed, and the wheat ripening period in southern Shanxi is more than a month earlier than in central Shanxi. Currently, 70% of the southern region has been harvested. Central and southeastern Shanxi are ripening from south to north and are starting to be harvested successively. According to telephone reports received by the provincial leadership organs, this year's wheat ears are large, the grains are full and heavy, and the actual harvest generally exceeds estimates by about a quarter. Before the harvest, the total output of the province's 18 million mu of wheat was estimated at 2.5 billion to 2.7 billion jin, but recently it has increased to about 3 billion jin. Large-scale and high-yield harvests are constantly emerging. According to existing incomplete statistics, there are 640,000 mu with an average yield of over 400 jin per mu, of which 20,000 mu have an average yield of 800 jin per mu, and more than 13,000 mu have an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently held a mobile on-site wheat conference, organizing county heads, agricultural college professors, and experimental station directors to visit and evaluate Yongji, Jieyu, and Hongzhao counties, and to summarize and exchange wheat yield increase experiences. According to the conference analysis, in addition to the widespread promotion of deep plowing, close planting, superior seeds, timely sowing, and pest control, the outstanding experience for Shanxi Province's wheat bumper harvest is good field management. This year, Shanxi Province's wheat encountered a 100-day drought during the sowing season. Most of the sowing was done under drought conditions, and the seedlings were initially yellow and weak. More than 5 million mu were missing seedlings and had broken ridges. Later, natural disasters such as insects, frost, and drought were encountered. However, under the slogan of "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results" of the Party, the province's farmers implemented universal watering, weeding, rolling, topdressing, and pest control. Many areas implemented repeated reviews, crash programs, continuous summaries, and continuous improvements, and persistently discovered and eliminated three types of wheat seedlings. Jieyu County took the "experimental fields" of leading cadres as examples, continuously reviewed, continuously consolidated first-class wheat fields, improved second-class wheat fields, and eliminated third-class wheat fields, finally enabling the third-class wheat fields to catch up with the general wheat fields, and the county's 390,000 mu of wheat fields all achieved bumper harvests.

After more than five months of intense struggle, the province finally reversed the historically low-yield situation of wheat and achieved a universal and balanced bumper harvest. Within various wheat-producing areas, there is also a new atmosphere of bumper harvests in irrigated land, bumper harvests in dry land, bumper harvests in regular crops, bumper harvests in replanted crops, bumper harvests in first-class wheat, and bumper harvests in third-class wheat. In Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative of Jieyu County, there are 100 mu of "inferior" land, which used to produce only 56 jin per mu. This year, a youth shock brigade has made great efforts to cultivate it, and it is expected to produce 900 to 1,000 jin per mu, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields.

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 15th dispatch) Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of 10 million mu of summer crops. According to the recent actual measurement and acceptance in various places, the total summer harvest output of the prefecture has reached more than 3 billion jin, more than double the 1.43 billion jin of last year's bumper summer harvest; the average yield per unit area of the prefecture has also increased from 154 jin last year to more than 300 jin.

Xiangyang Prefecture is located in the northwestern part of Hubei Province and is a well-known low-yield area in the province. Before liberation, the average wheat yield per mu was only 70 to 80 jin. Before the cooperativization, the total summer harvest output of the prefecture in general years was only 500 to 600 million jin. With the gradual cooperativization of agriculture, the output increased rapidly. By last year, the total summer harvest output of the prefecture had increased sharply to 1.43 billion jin, and the yield per unit area had increased to 154 jin. According to preliminary understanding, the wheat output of the five counties and cities of Xiangyang, Guanghua, Zaoyang, Zhuxi, and Xiangfan in this prefecture this year not only doubled the summer harvest of last year but also caught up with and exceeded the total grain output of last year, realizing the slogan of "one season to catch the whole year." The average yield of wheat per mu in the eight counties and cities of Gucheng, Xiangyang, Sui County, Zaoyang, Yicheng, Nanzhang, Guanghua, and Xiangfan all exceeded 300 jin, of which Gucheng County's 260,000 mu of wheat reached more than 500 jin per mu. All these facts have removed the so-called "low-yield area" label and greatly liberated people's thinking.

Along with the large-scale bumper harvest, a large number of high-yield records have appeared in various places. Last year, the highest wheat record created by Fang County in this prefecture was 1,540 jin. This year, the yield of wheat per mu exceeding 1,000 jin has become a widespread phenomenon in this prefecture. According to preliminary understanding, there are about 200,000 mu of wheat with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu in the prefecture. Last year, there was not a single 1,000-jin cooperative in this prefecture, but this year there are nearly 100 1,000-jin cooperatives in the prefecture, of which Gucheng County alone has more than 50 1,000-jin cooperatives and more than 270 1,000-jin teams. The Star Light Cooperative's Wang Mingjin experimental field, which achieved a high yield of 4,353 jin, appeared in Gucheng County.

Summer harvest crops such as broad beans, peas, and barley have also seen many high-yield examples. The Happiness Road Cooperative in the suburbs of Xiangfan City had 24.4 mu of broad beans, with an average yield of 1,064 jin per mu, of which 1.5 mu reached a yield of 1,287.4 jin. Zhangpo Cooperative in Xiangyang County had 15 mu (upland) of peas, with an average yield of 825 jin per mu. Permanent and Fangchong Cooperatives in this county had 10 mu of barley, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. The Hongwei Cooperative had 22 mu (upland) of barley with a yield of 1,204 jin per mu. These high-yield records are rare nationwide.

The fact that Xiangyang Prefecture has achieved a bumper summer harvest proves that whether it is upland or dry land or mountain or paddy field, as long as careful cultivation is carried out, wheat can achieve high yields. Baokang, Zhushan, and Zhuxi counties are all large mountainous areas, and many high-yield examples have appeared this year. Zhuxi County has 11 1,000-jin cooperatives this year, and there are 50 mu of wheat with an average yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu.

Although Xiangyang Prefecture has achieved a bumper summer harvest, according to inspection, the increase in production in this prefecture is still unbalanced. Approximately 1 million mu of wheat still yields only about 100 jin per mu. Therefore, more than a month before the wheat harvest, various places organized cadres and the masses to visit and appraise the wheat fields in person, summarize high-yield experiences, find loopholes, further overcome conservative thinking, and study this year's winter sowing measures, thereby laying a good foundation ideologically and technically for a greater bumper harvest of summer crops next year.

    小麦低产区变成高产区
    山西省普遍大丰收，襄阳专区增产一倍多
    本报太原15日电　记者冯健伟、武赞庭报道：历来小麦低产的山西省今年的小麦也获得空前的大丰收。据估计，全省小麦的总产量可达三十亿斤左右，超过原订大跃进计划的11％，超过去年总产量的68％，超过丰收的1956年的23％。
    山西省产麦地区分散，小麦成熟期在晋南比晋中早一个多月。目前南部已收割70％，晋中、晋东南自南而北次第黄熟，陆续开始收割。据省领导机关目前接到各地电话报告，今年小麦穗大，粒粒饱满，很有份量，一般实收获量超过估计四分之一左右。全省一千八百多万亩小麦收割前估计总产量为二十五亿到二十七亿斤，最近又增加到三十亿斤左右。大面积丰产和高额丰产正在不断出现，据现有不完全统计，平均亩产四百斤以上的有六十四万亩，其中有两万亩平均亩产八百斤，有一万三千多亩平均亩产一千斤。
    山西省人民委员会最近召开了小麦流动现场会议，组织各县县长、农学院教授、试验站主任到永济、解虞、洪赵县参观评比，总结交流小麦增产经验。据会议分析，山西省小麦大丰收的原因，除普遍推广深耕、密植、优种、适时播种和治虫等增产措施外，突出的经验是田间管理工作好。今年山西省的小麦在播种时期遭遇一百天大旱，大部是抗旱下种，初期幼苗黄弱，有五百多万亩缺苗断垅，后期还遇到虫、冻、旱等自然灾害。但是，全省农民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游的口号鼓舞下，实行普浇、普锄、普滚压、普追肥、普治虫。许多地区实行排队再排队，突击再突击，总结再总结，提高再提高的顽强战斗，连续发现和消灭三类麦苗。解虞县实行以领导干部“试验田”为榜样，连续排队，连续巩固一类麦田，提高二类麦田，消灭三类麦田，终于使三类麦田赶上一般麦田，全县三十九万亩麦田齐获丰收。
    经过五个多月的紧张斗争，全省终于扭转了小麦历年来低产的局面，取得普遍平衡的大丰收。在各类产麦地区内，也出现水地丰收，旱地也丰收，正茬丰收，回茬也丰收，一类麦丰收，三类麦也丰收的新气象。解虞县丰收农业社有一百亩“下等”地，过去每亩只产五十六斤，今年由青年突击队尽力培育，每亩预计可产九百到一千斤，低产田变成高产田。
    本报武汉15日电　湖北省襄阳专区一千万亩夏季作物获得了史无前例的大丰收。根据最近各地实打验收的情况看来，全区夏收总产量达到三十亿斤以上，比大丰收的去年夏收总产量十四亿三千万斤翻了一番还多；全区平均单位面积产量，也由去年的一百五十四斤跃增到三百斤以上。
    襄阳专区地处湖北省西北部，是全省出了名的低产区。解放前小麦平均亩产只有七、八十斤。合作化以前，一般年成全区夏收总产量也只有五、六亿斤。随着农业逐步合作化，产量上升很快，到了去年，全区夏收总产量已经激增到十四亿三千万斤，单位面积产量增加到一百五十四斤。据初步了解，这个专区的襄阳、光化、枣阳、竹溪、襄樊等五个县市，今年麦收产量不仅比去年夏收翻了一番，而且还赶上和超过了去年全年粮食总产量，实现了“一季捞全年”的口号。谷城、襄阳、随县、枣阳、宜城、南漳、光化和襄樊八个县市，小麦平均单产都超过三百斤，其中谷城县二十六万亩小麦亩产达到五百斤以上。所有这些事实，就把所谓“低产区”的帽子摘下来了，大大解放了人们的思想。
    与大面积丰产的同时，各地出现了大量的高额丰产纪录。去年，这个专区房县创造的小麦最高纪录是一千五百四十斤，今年这个专区小麦亩产千斤以上已成为大量现象。据初步了解，全区亩产一千斤以上的小麦约有二十万亩。去年，这里还没有一个小麦千斤社，而今年全区却出现了近百个千斤社，其中仅谷城一个县，就有五十多个千斤社和二百七十多个千斤队。高产达到4353斤的是星光社王明进试验田就出现在谷城县。
    蚕豆、豌豆、大麦等夏收作物也出现了不少高额丰产典型。襄樊市郊区幸福之路社二十四亩四分蚕豆，平均单产一千零六十四斤，其中有一亩五分单产达到了一千二百八十七斤四两。襄阳县张坡社十五亩（岗地）豌豆，平均单产八百二十五斤，这个县永久、方冲两社十亩大麦，平均单产一千斤，宏伟社二十二亩（岗地）大麦亩产达到了一千二百零四斤。这些高额丰产纪录，在全国来说，都是罕见的。
    襄阳专区夏季大丰收的事实证明，不管岗坡旱地还是山地水田，只要精耕细作，小麦就可以获得高额丰产。保康、竹山、竹溪等县都是大山区，今年就出现了不少高额丰产典型。竹溪县今年光千斤社就有十一个，还有五十亩小麦平均亩产二千斤以上。
    襄阳专区的夏收作物虽然取得了大丰收，但根据检查，这个专区增产还不平衡，大约有一百万亩小麦亩产仍在一百斤左右。因此，早在麦收前一个多月，各地便组织干部和群众到麦田里实地参观、鉴定，总结高产经验，寻找漏洞，进一步克服保守思想，研究今年冬播措施，从而在思想上、技术上为明年夏收作物更大丰收打下良好基础。
