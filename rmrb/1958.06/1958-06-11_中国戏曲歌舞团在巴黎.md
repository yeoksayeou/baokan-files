    China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater in Paris

    "When the curtain of the Paris International Theater Festival opened for Chinese Peking Opera, the Parisian public rekindled the passion of three years ago..."
    -- Comment from "l'Humanité"

    At the end of April, the French newspaper "l'Humanité" featured the smiling faces of several Chinese actresses, with a striking headline above the picture: "Beijing Smiles at Paris." This reported the arrival of the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater to participate in the grand 1958 Paris International Theater Festival.

    This artistic troupe has been performing at the theater festival for over a month now and will soon leave France. During its nearly month-long stay in Paris in April and May, it left an indelible impression on the hearts of Parisians. In those twenty-one successful performances, just as "Le Parisien Libéré" said, "Beijing's opera acrobats, mime artists, opera singers, and dancers have once again conquered Paris."

    Starting on April 29th, the opera and dance drama theater began performing at the world-renowned Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in the central district of Paris. Before the performances, some people doubted whether the opera and dance drama theater could achieve the same success as the Chinese Art Troupe's visit to Paris in 1955. But these concerns were dispelled after the first performance. The first performance by the Chinese artists was considered the most lively day of the theater festival.

    A commentary in "l'Humanité" stated: "When the curtain of the Paris International Theater Festival opened for Chinese Peking Opera, the Parisian public rekindled the passion of three years ago. This is a festival of colorful splendor, enchanting music, and graceful dance, a festival shared by the whole world. At first, we thought we wouldn't be as surprised as we were when we first saw it three years ago, but then our thoughts immediately changed, and we were once again dreamily immersed in a heavenly mythical world."

    Parisian theater critics considered this the most beautiful, most rare, and most astonishing theatrical performance, saying: "Peking Opera is the best theatrical performance in the world, something that Western theater people haven't even dreamed of for more than a century."

    The first program performed by the opera and dance drama theater was "Flower Drum Lantern," and the young actors' cheerful, powerful, light, and skilled dancing immediately won enthusiastic applause from the audience. As the evening progressed, the audience's emotions rose higher and higher. During "Sizhou City" and "Dragon Dance," the audience stomped their feet frantically on the floor, or beat on the chairs (a European habit of cheering), and even shouted.

    There were always such exciting scenes in the opera and dance drama theater's subsequent performances.

    Parisian newspapers praised the Kunqu Opera "A Hundred Flowers Presenting the Sword," performed jointly by Yu Zhenfei and Yan Huizhu. Renowned theater critic Guy Leclerc wrote: "In this play, the characters' emotions are mostly expressed through facial expressions, which is rare, and the actors perform very delicately and realistically. It is worth noting that the comedic roles and performances are not detached from the plot in Chinese opera. Those naive, funny, or witty performances become an indispensable part of the entire play, a subtle method of expressing the overall emotion. Even Molière and Musset could not achieve this."

    Li Yuru's Peking Opera "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" also received special praise. Many people who had not seen Chinese opera before were able to understand the entire plot of the play, so as soon as the curtain fell, enthusiastic applause rang out.

    "Sizhou City," with its flashing swords and fierce fighting, was even easier for foreigners who did not understand Chinese to understand. When the Turtle Spirit fought countless gods with a sword and spear, the audience couldn't help but clap and cheer enthusiastically. Actress Zhang Meijuan took bows more than ten times before the enthusiastic audience quieted down.

    A commentator from "Le Parisien Libéré" commented: "This battle between heavenly soldiers and water generals has a strong Shakespearean flavor. For three years, I have been thinking that Western directors could use the combat scenes of Peking Opera to perform famous plays such as 'Richard III' and 'King Lear.'"

    The Parisian audience particularly remembered Wang Mingzhong, who performed "Havoc in Heaven" in Paris three years ago. This time, his performance in "Crouching Tiger Ridge" gave people the same fresh feeling as "Havoc in Heaven." "Libération" said: "'Crouching Tiger Ridge' brought us flexible, lively, light, and agile combat. The soldiers leaped high, dodged quickly, somersaulted continuously, and turned danger into safety. Every move was as fast as a fleeing rabbit and as light as a flying swallow, making people unable to keep up and stunned."

    The "Dragon Dance," which symbolizes the brave and kind character of the Chinese working people, was particularly appreciated by Parisians, and the comments it aroused were too numerous to list. A commentator from "Libération" said: "From today onwards, don't tell me that dragons don't exist anymore. I have seen them with my own eyes, just as I have seen everyone."

    Every time the Chinese artists' performance ended, it was already close to midnight, but many people who had watched the play at the entrance of the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre were reluctant to leave for a long time. Some waited to congratulate and say goodbye to the actors who came out, while others in the square even imitated the singing of the young female roles and hummed the tunes of Peking Opera.

### 中国戏曲歌舞团在巴黎

    中国戏曲歌舞团在巴黎
    “当巴黎国际戏剧节的帷幕为中国京剧打开时，巴黎的公众又燃起了三年前的激情……”
    ——“人道报”的评论
    4月末尾，法国“人道报”上有一天出现了几个中国女演员微笑的面容，图片上面是一个醒目的标题“北京向巴黎微笑”。这样报道了参加1958年巴黎盛大的国际戏剧节的中国戏曲歌舞团的到来。
    这个艺术团自从参加戏剧节演出到现在已经一个多月，不久就要离开法国了。它在4、5月间逗留巴黎的将近一个月的日子中，在巴黎人的心中留下了难以磨灭的印象。在那二十一场成功的演出里，正像“解放了的巴黎人报”说的，“北京歌剧的险技家、哑剧家、歌剧家和舞蹈家又征服了巴黎”。
    4月29日起，歌舞团开始在巴黎市中心区世界闻名的萨拉·伯纳尔剧院演出。演出前曾有些人怀疑这次戏曲歌舞团能不能获得像1955年中国艺术团访问巴黎时那样成功。但是在第一次演出后就打消了人们这种顾虑。中国艺术家的第一次演出被认为是戏剧节最热闹的一天。
    “人道报”的一篇评论说：“当巴黎国际戏剧节的帷幕为中国京剧打开时，巴黎的公众又燃起了三年前的激情。这是一个五色缤纷、乐声缭绕、轻歌曼舞的节日，是全世界所共享的节日。在开始时，我们以为不会再像三年前初见时那么感到惊奇了，可是后来我们的想法立刻改变，我们又如梦如痴地浸沉到天堂般的神话世界中。”
    巴黎的戏剧评论家认为这是最美丽、最稀奇、最惊人的戏剧演出，他们说：“京剧是全世界最好的戏剧演出，这是一个多世纪以来西方剧人连梦中也未曾想到的事。”
    歌舞团演出的第一个节目是“花鼓灯”，青年演员们爽朗有力、轻快纯熟的舞姿一下子就博得了观众热烈狂欢的掌声。随着晚会的进行，观众的情绪也越来越高涨，到“泗洲城”和“龙舞”时观众用脚拼命地跺着地板，或打着椅子（欧洲人叫好时的习惯），甚至叫起来。
    在歌舞团以后的演出中每次总有这种激动的场面。
    巴黎各报推崇备至地评论了俞振飞和言慧珠合演的昆曲“百花赠剑”。著名戏剧评论家居伊·勒克莱克写道：“在这出戏中，人物的感情多半是通过面部表情来体现的，这一点很难得，演员们演得非常细腻、逼真。值得注意的是，打诨插科的滑稽角色和表演，在中国戏里不是脱离剧情出现的，那些天真可笑或滑稽机灵的表演成了全剧一个不可缺少的部分，是表达整个感情的一个细致的方法。这一点连莫里哀和缪塞都没有办到。”
    李玉茹的京戏“拾玉镯”也获得了特别的好评。许多没有看过中国戏的人都能领会戏中的全部情节，因此帷幕刚刚下垂，便响起了热烈的掌声。
    刀光剑影、大打出手的“泗洲城”对于听不懂中国话的外国人更易了解。当水母娘娘以一刀一枪奋战无数神将时，观众情不自禁、狂热地鼓起掌、喝起彩来。演员张美娟一连谢了十多次幕，热情的观众才安静下来。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”的评论员评论说：“这种天兵水将之间的搏斗是带着浓厚的莎士比亚色彩的。三年来我一直在想，西方的导演尽可以采用京剧的战斗场面来演‘理查三世’‘李尔王’等名剧。”
    巴黎观众对三年前在巴黎演“闹天宫”的王鸣仲特别记得清楚。这次他演“卧虎沟”也正如“闹天宫”一样给人以新鲜的感觉。“解放报”说：“‘卧虎沟’给我们带来了灵活生动、轻快敏捷的战斗。战士们纵身高跳、闪身逃躲、筋斗连翻、化险为夷。一举一动，疾如脱免，轻如飞燕，真叫人接应不暇，目瞪口呆。”
    象征着中国劳动人民勇敢又善良性格的“龙舞”，获得了巴黎人的特别赞赏，它所引起的评论更是繁多到难于列举了。“解放报”的评论员说：“从今天起，不要再跟我说龙是不存在的了。我亲眼看过了，正如同我看见了大家一样。”
    每次中国艺术家演出结束时总已接近深夜，可是萨拉·伯纳尔剧院门口许多看完戏的人很久也不肯离去。有的等着向出来的演员祝贺告别，有的在广场上竟学着花旦的嗓子学着哼起京戏的调子来。
