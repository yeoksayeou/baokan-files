How Can Swallows Know the Ambition of a Swan?
　　Yú Dàyú

　　After the news came out that some counties had decided to establish their own universities, most people were greatly encouraged and felt very excited. Because, according to the rules of our ancestors, small counties could only produce "xiucai" (successful candidates in the imperial examinations), but now we are going to produce "zhuangyuan" (the top scholar in the imperial examination)!

　　However, I also heard some "experts" in this field, that is, some university professors, who did not approve of this approach. Among them, even some people who usually "don't talk about state affairs" expressed their attitude this time, saying that county-run universities must be "carefully considered."

　　Why should county-run universities be "carefully considered"? Obviously, it is not because we should generally think deeply about everything we do. Rather, it is because they believe that a small county is hardly qualified to run a university. According to these "experts," a university is a very large, very spacious, very profound, very broad, very mysterious, and very remarkable school. It must have magnificent school buildings, a large amount of funding, countless regulations, a complete set of systems, imported instruments, foreign-educated PhDs, a wide variety of courses, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign theories, and so on, to be considered "formal."

　　Of course, the above is not entirely useless. We do not have too many formal universities now, but not enough. The problem is that these people seem to think that the essence of a university lies entirely in these things. Thus, a professor of electrical engineering who burns out several electric meters in a row when operating a machine seems to take it for granted; a professor of entomology who doesn't dare to admit his profession when going to the countryside, fearing being stumped by farmers, doesn't feel ashamed either. As for how many semi-finished products in terms of professional skills and political failures are cultivated in such universities, it seems to be even less the concern of these "experts."

　　Why haven't experts and scholars "carefully considered" these issues? The reason is that, although the above is contrary to political struggle and production construction, it does not contradict their so-called "formal" standards.

　　What exactly does standardization mean? In my opinion, it means making organizations more sound, systems more rational, equipment more complete, and so on. The purpose is to further improve the efficiency of revolutionary work, make new things easier to discover, and make good things grow faster. In recent years, the rapid progress of various undertakings in our country, standardization, although not the only factor, is also a relatively important link. However, the unfortunate thing is that "standardization" is sometimes understood by some people as things like bureaucracy, formalism, empty and tedious procedures, and detachment from reality. Some people even simply believe that standardization is to restore the old traditions of the bourgeoisie. Do you want to do something? Please first write all kinds of lengthy and cumbersome reports, and then go through layers of formalistic review, not only to see if it complies with a series of old conventions and systems, but also to check whether there are precedents in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. No matter what practice proves, what genius creates, what the masses welcome, or what production needs, as soon as it violates any regulations, systems, classics, conventions, celebrities, scholars, European and American civilization, Western customs, newly added superstitions, or inherent prejudices, it will all be invalid. It's really "If you have 'Yu Jia Ji', you cannot even fart". Standardization has been misinterpreted as a book of superstitions, making people wary of offending ghosts and gods in every move.

　　People with junior high school education actually want to find out the habits of termites? Counties in the mountains dare to run universities? Farmers also want to be scientific researchers? Which dictionary has ever linked these words with their names? Some people think this way, and cannot help but smile suspiciously and contemptuously. They say: "This is really ants trying to shake a big tree, ridiculously overestimating themselves!"

　　However, the facts are the most impolite. The fact is that, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the bourgeoisie's spells and prescriptions can no longer scare the liberated Chinese people. When engineers all over the world were helpless, didn't an ordinary Chinese worker invent the automatic anti-encirclement disk? When many biologists were still conducting "research work" year after year, didn't an ordinary person with a junior high school education find the best method for preventing and controlling termites in the world? The fact is that, in today's China, not only people with junior high school education study laws, but people with even lower education levels also study laws; not only one county runs its own university, but many counties run their own universities; not only farmers become scientific researchers, but all kinds of people become scientific researchers.

　　Let me, without considering my own limitations, on behalf of all kinds of experts, scholars, advanced elements, and model heroes who have grown up in labor and contributed to socialist construction, use a ready-made saying to retort to those discouraged "standardization" gentlemen: "How can swallows know the ambition of a swan!"

    燕雀安知鸿鹄志
    于大愚
    有的县决定自办大学的消息传出后，一般人都受了很大的鼓舞，感到非常兴奋。因为，按照我们老祖宗的规矩，小小的县分是只能考秀才的，现在我们却要考状元了！
    然而，我也听到有些这方面的“专家”，即有些大学教授，却并不以这种做法为然。他们里面，连有些平时“不谈国事”的人，这回也表示了态度，说县办大学必须“慎重考虑”。
    为什么县办大学就要“慎重考虑”呢？显然不是因为一般地我们办什么事都要深思熟虑。而是认为小小的一个县分，几乎就没有什么资格办大学。按照这些“专家”的看法，所谓大学，即非常大，非常阔，非常高深，非常广博，非常神秘，非常了不起的学校也。必须有堂皇的校舍、大量的经费、无数的规章、成套的制度、进口的仪器、留洋的博士、五花八门的课程、古今中外的学说等等之类，才算“正规”。
    当然，上述种种，并不是毫无用处。正规的大学，我们现在并不是太多，而是不够。问题在于这些人仿佛就此认为大学之所以成为大学，全部就在那里了。于是，多年的电机学教授一操作机器就连续烧坏几个电表，仿佛还理所当然；昆虫学教授下乡不敢承认自己的本行，怕被农民问倒，也不以为耻。至于在这种大学里培养出的学生有多少业务上的半成品和政治上的废品，似乎就更非这些“专家”的分内之事了。
    为什么专家学者们对这些问题没有“慎重考虑”过呢？原因是，以上种种与政治斗争、生产建设虽然背道而驰，可是和他们所谓“正规”的标准却没有什么不符之处。
    到底什么叫正规化？据我看，就是使组织更健全，制度更合理，设备更完善等等。其目的在于使革命工作的效率进一步提高，使新事物更容易发现，使好东西更快地成长。几年来，我国各种事业的突飞猛进，正规化虽然不是唯一的因素，也是比较重要的环节之一。然而糟糕的是，“正规化”有时竟被某些人理解成官僚主义、形式主义、空洞烦琐、脱离实际一类的东西。甚至还有人干脆认为正规化就是恢复资产阶级的旧传统。你要干点什么吗？请先写种种冗长累赘的报告，再经层层形式主义的审核，既要看看合不合一系列的陈规旧制，还要查查古今中外有没有先例可循。管你实践证明的，天才创造的，群众欢迎的，生产需要的，一触犯什么规章、制度、典籍、惯例、名流、学者、欧美文明、西方习俗、新添的迷信、固有的成见，就一律无效。真是“家有‘玉匣记’，不能放个屁”。正规化竟被曲解成迷信书。使人一举一动都要提防冲撞鬼神。
    初中程度的人竟要寻找白蚁生活的规律？山沟里的县分胆敢办什么大学？庄稼汉也要当科学研究员？什么字典里曾经把这些辞儿和他们的名字连在一起过呢？有些人这样想着，就不免由怀疑而轻蔑地笑了。他们说：“这真是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量！”
    然而，事实是最不客气的。事实是，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，资产阶级的符咒仙方再也吓唬不住解放了的中国人了。在全世界的工程师们都无能为力的时候，中国的一个普通工人不就发明了自动化的反围盘么？当多少生物学家们还在年复一年地进行着“研究工作”的时候，一个初中程度的普通人，不就找出了目前世界上最好的防治白蚁的方法么？事实是，在现在的中国，不仅初中程度的人研究规律，更低文化程度的人也要研究规律；不仅一个县自办大学，很多县都要自办大学；不仅农民当科学研究员，其他各种各样的人都要当科学研究员。
    让我不揣冒昧，代替在劳动中长成，对社会主义建设做出贡献的各式各样的专家、学者、先进分子、英雄模范们，用一句现成的辞儿，回敬那些泄气的“正规化”先生们：“燕雀安知鸿鹄之志哉！”
