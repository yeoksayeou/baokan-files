Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 29th. The Korean Central News Agency today quoted a Seoul Hapdong News Agency report stating that well-informed sources from the U.S. Eighth Army stationed in South Korea said on the 27th that the U.S. military will begin establishing a missile base near Chuncheon in the southern part of Gangwon Province, South Korea, on July 4th.

The report said that the U.S. military will move a military base on the west coast of South Korea to Chuncheon, transforming it into the Fourth Missile Command, thereby "further strengthening" its attack power. It also stated that this command will conduct a test launch of "Honest John" rockets on July 4th. Chuncheon is very close to the Korean military demarcation line. The fact that the United States is building a missile base there shows that the United States' atomic war preparations and provocative activities are becoming increasingly rampant.

After unilaterally declaring the abandonment of its obligations under Article 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement in June 1957, the United States has continuously shipped atomic weapons into South Korea and conducted atomic war exercises. The United States had also long ago reorganized the U.S. Seventh Division and Twenty-Fourth Division stationed in Korea into "Pentomic Divisions," equipping them with illegally imported rocket launchers capable of firing atomic warheads.

    美国加紧原子备战活动
    将在南朝鲜建立导弹基地
    据新华社平壤29日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社今天引汉城合同通讯社消息报道，侵占南朝鲜的美国第八军的消息灵通人士在27日说，美军将于7月4日开始在南朝鲜江原道南部的春川附近建立一个导弹基地。
    消息说，美军将把它在南朝鲜西海岸的一个军事基地移到春川，变成第四导弹指挥部，而攻击力量将因此“进一步加强”。它又说，这个指挥部将在7月4日进行发射“诚实的约翰”火箭的试验。春川离朝鲜军事分界线很近，美国在那里修建导弹基地的事实表明，美国进行的原子备战挑衅活动日益猖狂。
    美国在1957年6月擅自宣布废弃它对朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项所规定的义务以后，即不断地把原子武器运入南朝鲜和进行原子战争演习。美国也早已经把侵朝美军第七师和第二十四师改编为“五单位制原子师”，用非法输入的能够发射原子弹头的火箭炮装备它们。
