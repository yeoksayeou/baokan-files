Xinhua News Agency, 10th: China's petroleum industry has already unveiled a new page in its history. This year, the entire country has started or is about to start construction on over five hundred small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum factories. These five hundred plus factories are distributed across more than twenty provinces and autonomous regions including Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Guizhou. Their total production capacity will reach more than 1.2 million tons, equivalent to 80% of China's total petroleum production last year.

This is the first batch of local petroleum factories determined for construction after consultation between the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and various provinces at the recently held local petroleum industry conference. The vast majority of them will be put into production this year or next. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, there will be thousands upon thousands of small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum factories constructed throughout the country. In this way, China's petroleum industry will advance rapidly at a speed that was difficult to achieve in the past by relying solely on the construction of large-scale plants and large oil fields. Among them, the first batch of small and medium-sized plants alone can produce more than one million tons of crude oil next year.

In order to enable this batch of small and medium-sized oil plants to be constructed rapidly, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and various provinces are strengthening cooperation to resolve technical and equipment problems.

The Ministry of Petroleum Industry will first help the provinces build sixty-eight demonstration plants that can all be put into production this year. In addition to a portion of the required complete set of equipment being allocated by the state, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry will organize its affiliated machine repair factories to carry out crash production. The fifteen sets of standard designs for small and medium-sized synthetic petroleum plants with annual output ranging from three hundred to five thousand tons designed by the Ministry's design institutes will soon be distributed to various locations. In addition, the Ministry also plans to transfer a group of personnel from existing technical forces and graduating students to support various regions. State-owned petroleum industries in Fushun, Jinxi, and other places are also training technical workers for various regions. In this way, the various regions will receive more than one thousand technical personnel and workers from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry alone this year.

Various regions have also fully utilized their enthusiasm and creativity in developing local petroleum industries. Many county party secretaries personally led the masses to search for oil refining resources everywhere and overcame difficulties such as lack of experience, equipment, and materials. They refined petroleum in a very short period of time. For example, in the Yibin Prefecture of Sichuan Province, after the prefectural party secretary and county party secretaries personally took action and concentrated the wisdom of the masses, they used earthen ditches instead of iron pipes and bellows instead of blowers, and only spent 20 yuan to build the first dry distillation pile; plus the refining equipment, the total investment was only more than 120 yuan. The refined oil products can not only operate automobiles, tractors, and diesel engines, but also be used as lamp oil and machine oil. Now, the prefecture has regarded the establishment of petroleum factories as one of the keys to solving agricultural mechanization. The entire prefecture plans to build dozens of such small petroleum plants this year. The example of the Zhengzhou City Waste Oil Processing Plant in Henan Province using coal tar recovered from local coking to process gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, etc., has also opened up new avenues for local petroleum industries. It is estimated that the country can recover at least nearly one million tons of coal tar from the local coking industry. These coal tars were discarded in the past. If they can all be utilized, tens of thousands of tons more gasoline and diesel can be produced.

    大办中小石油工厂　揭开石油工业史新的一页
    建厂五百多座  产油一百二十万吨
    今年建成这批工厂后产油能力相当于去年全国产量80％
    新华社10日讯　我国石油工业已经揭开了它历史上新的一页。今年全国各地已经开始建设和即将建设的中小型人造石油工厂共有五百多个。这五百多个工厂分布在河北、江苏、广东、贵州等二十几个省和自治区，总生产能力将达一百二十多万吨，相当于去年我国全部石油产量的80％。
  这是石油工业部在最近召开的地方石油工业会议上与各省协商后确定建设的第一批地方石油工厂，它们绝大部分将在今年或明年投入生产。在第二个五年计划期间，还将有成千上万个中小型的人造石油工厂在全国各地建设起来。这样，我国石油工业就将以过去单靠建设大型厂和大油田所难以达到的速度迅速前进。其中单是第一批中小型厂在明年就可以生产出一百多万吨原油。
    为了使这批中小型石油厂迅速地建设起来，石油工业部和各省正在加强协作，以解决技术和设备问题。
    石油工业部将首先帮助各省建设起六十八个都在今年就能投入生产的示范厂。所需的全套器材设备，除了由国家调拨一部分外，由石油部组织所属的机修工厂突击生产。部属的各个设计院设计的十五套年产三百到五万吨的中小型人造石油厂的标准设计。不久将全部分发给各地。此外，这个部还准备从现有的技术力量和即将毕业的学生中抽调一批人员支援各地。抚顺、锦西等地的国营石油工业，也都在为各地培养技术工人。这样，今年各地仅从石油工业部方面得到的技术人员和工人，就有一千多人。
    各地在发展地方石油工业中也充分发挥了积极性和创造性。很多县委书记亲自带领群众到处找炼油资源，并且克服了经验、设备和材料等不足的困难。在很短期内就炼出了石油。如四川宜宾专区在地委书记、县委书记亲自动手和集中群众智慧以后，利用瓦沟代替铁管，风箱代替鼓风机，只花二十元就建成了第一个干馏堆；加上炼油设备，总投资也不过一百二十多元。炼制出来的油品不但可以开动汽车、拖拉机和柴油机，也可以作灯油和机器油。现在，这个专区已经把举办石油工厂作为解决农业机械化的关键之一，今年全专区就准备办几十个这样的小型石油厂。河南郑州市废油加工厂利用土法炼焦中回收出来的煤焦油，加工成汽油、煤油、轻柴油等的事例，也为地方石油工业开辟了新的门路。据估计，全国从土法炼焦工业中至少可以回收到近百万吨煤焦油，这些煤焦油过去都是被废弃的，如果能够全部加以利用，就可以多生产几十万吨汽油和柴油。
