Ode to the Great Leap Forward

	Setting Up a Ring by the Open Hearth Furnace
	Chen Zhewu
	Politics takes command,
	Production greatly increases,
	Soaring enthusiasm and great dedication,
	Heroes compete on the arena.
The competition on the arena began, and the steelworkers, with the most heroic feelings, wrote these four lines of rhyming clappers and pasted them next to the "arena." The heroes of the steelmaking workshop are all eager to try, ready to jump onto the arena and show their skills.

That afternoon, the general Party branch of the Xiaoping Furnace Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company officially made the eighth revision to this year's Great Leap Forward plan. The number in this revision increased by 42,000 tons of steel compared to the first Great Leap Forward plan. That very night, the third shift of the smelting section, working the middle shift, created a new record for high-yield, high-quality production. Xie Kun, the duty director and an old steelworker, then set up a "fast steelmaking arena." On the left was written: "Respectfully invite heroes from all walks of life to compete in the arena to determine strengths and weaknesses"; on the right was written: "Specially invite steelmaking heroes to compete by the open hearth furnace." In addition, the two sides also wrote the following two slogans, one was: "Charge into battle, fight tenaciously"; the other was: "Despise difficulties, enthusiasm soars to the sky."

This arena was set up at nine o'clock in the evening. In the middle of the arena was written:

	Ring Leader: Xie Kun.
	Date: Middle shift, May 21st.
	Smelting time: 15 minutes shorter than planned.
	Output: 200 kilograms more than planned.
	Quality: Grade A steel.
	Operation: Safe and accident-free.
	Manganese addition method: In the furnace.

As soon as this arena was set up, the first shift of smelting was on the night shift that day. When the workers of the first shift saw it, they were all ambitious and eager to challenge. Zhang Wenjin, the duty director and a young steelworker, then convened everyone to a meeting to discuss it. Everyone unanimously said: We must catch up resolutely and knock Xie Kun off the arena.

As they spoke, the workers of the first shift started working enthusiastically by the steelmaking furnace. Duty director Zhang Wenjin is a steelmaking expert. He was named a Sichuan Provincial Model Worker and a National Advanced Producer. In recent years, he has always maintained the glorious title of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's annual advanced producer. Old steelworker Xie Kun is also a good man. In the first quarter of this year, he also became an advanced producer in Sichuan Province. Both of them are duty directors, one setting up the arena and the other accepting the challenge. It is truly a battle of equals, a contest of talent. Who will win and who will lose? There is a big competition going on.

That night, Zhang Wenjin showed his skills. He displayed his most superb skills. Although he shortened the charging time of the steel compared to Xie Kun's steel by five minutes. However, due to the lack of close cooperation in the class, especially the untimely supply of hot iron, the smelting time was prolonged. Compared with the new record created by Xie Kun, the first furnace of steel lost the arena by a difference of four minutes in time.

The next morning, the second shift of smelting took over. They also accepted the challenge, but they were no match for the enemy. They lost the battle after smelting two furnaces of steel in a row.

Then, it was the third shift's turn to work. Ring leader Xie Kun was a little anxious when he saw that the other two shifts had not caught up. He hoped that everyone would catch up. Only when you chase me and I chase you can the arena be lively. Only when I catch you and you catch me can production increase every day. He checked his shortcomings. Because he was busy handing over and taking over shifts when he went to and from work, and he had to hold production meetings after work, he and Zhang Wenjin did not have the opportunity to meet and exchange opinions, and experience was not disseminated in time. An important experience for Xie Kun in creating a new record was: unity, cooperation, and close coordination. When he set up the arena, he invited the leaders of auxiliary work types such as the gas furnace and pig iron furnace to be "arena assistants," so the front and rear of the furnace cooperated very well. The reason why Zhang Wenjin lost the arena last night was because he did poorly in this aspect. Therefore, Xie Kun sent him a war letter and posted it on the "Great Leap Forward Platform," which read: "Respectfully invite the heroes of the first shift to compete in the arena." At the same time, he also wrote out his experience in creating a new record in a big-character poster and posted it prominently on the "Great Leap Forward Platform."

It is precisely:

	They don't give way to each other in the arena,
	Spreading experience is essential,
	Unite, help each other, and learn from the advanced,
	Red flowers of production bloom everywhere.

In the evening, the workers of the first shift saw the "invitation-style" war letter written by Xie Kun in the study room. Everyone was eager to try and rushed to the front. Zhang Wenjin learned from Xie Kun's experience of finding "arena assistants" and was even more confident. When everyone discussed the second challenge, he still clenched his fist: "Okay, catch up! We must invite Lao Xie off the arena tonight!"

As he spoke, they wrote such a battle song and posted it on the "Great Leap Forward Platform" to express their greatest determination.

	The war drums are rumbling,
	Heroes go to the battlefield,
	To create a new record for smelting,
	Smelt more high-quality steel.
	If you don't knock Xie Kun off the arena,
	You're not strong!

Immediately, the workers began a tense production battle by the steelmaking furnace. Zhang Wenjin personally directed and supervised the battle, taking the lead. Song Jinguang, the secretary of the shift Party branch, also came out to "expedite supplies and suppress the front," responsible for expediting and supervising the timely supply of hot iron. The pig iron furnace foreman and the workers in the blower room also cooperated closely. Three hours later, a fierce battle came to a temporary end. The bell rang behind the furnace, and the white-hot molten steel poured out of the furnace mouth. Suddenly, the steel ladle splashed with thousands of beautiful sparks.

At this time, Zhang Wenjin looked at the record of tapping the steel, and jumped up to the arena, tearing down Xie Kun's new record with a "brush."

Now, this "fast steelmaking arena" that compares more, faster, better, more economical, and safer is being fought fiercely. The entire workshop is being swept into a wave of competition full of heroism. It is precisely:

	Set up a battlefield by the open hearth furnace,
	Compete in smelting for more, faster, better, and more economical,
	Everyone is eager to try,
	Everyone is energetic and ambitious,
	You chase me and I chase you to compete for the ring leader,
	Both wisdom and courage are strong in martial arts,
	Happy news is reported every day in steelmaking,
	Red flowers of production bloom all over the hall.

### 马丁炉旁摆擂台

专栏：跃进之歌

    马丁炉旁摆擂台
    陈哲武
    政治挂了帅，
    生产大提高，
    干劲冲天钻劲大，
    擂台比武逞英豪。
    擂台比武开始了，炼钢工人用最豪壮的心情，写下了这四句快板贴在“擂台”旁边。炼钢车间的众家英雄，个个磨拳擦掌，准备跃上擂台，大显身手。
    这天下午，重庆钢铁公司小平炉车间党总支正式对今年的跃进规划作了第八次修改，这次修改的数字和第一次跃进规划比较，增加了四万二千吨钢。就在这天晚上，上中班的冶炼第三班就创造了一个高产优质新纪录。这个班的值班主任老炼钢工谢昆便摆下了一个“快速炼钢擂台”。左边写着：敬请各路英雄擂台比武分强弱；右边写着：特邀炼钢好汉马丁炉旁见高低。另外，两边还写有这样两条标语，一条是：冲锋陷阵，顽强战斗；另一条是：鄙视困难，干劲冲天。
    这个擂台是在晚上九点钟摆的，擂台中间写着：
    擂主：谢昆。
    日期：5月21日中班。
    冶炼时间：比计划缩短十五分。
    产量：比计划超额二百公斤。
    质量：甲类钢。
    操作：安全无事故。
    加锰方法：炉内。
    这个擂台一摆出来，当天上夜班的是冶炼第一班。第一班的工人见了，个个志大劲足，应擂上阵。值班主任、青年炼钢工张文金便召集大家开会讨论。大家一致表示：坚决赶上去，要把谢昆从擂台上打下来。
    说着，第一班的工人便在炼钢炉旁热火朝天地干开了。值班主任张文金是个炼钢能手，他曾被评为四川省劳动模范和全国先进生产者。这几年来，一直都保持着重钢年度先进生产者的光荣称号。老炼钢工谢昆也是一条好汉，今年第一季度他也当上了四川省的先进生产者。他们两人都是值班主任，一个摆擂，一个应擂，真是棋逢对手，将遇良才，究竟谁胜谁负，大有一场争夺。
    这天晚上，张文金大显身手，他施展了生平最高超的技艺，虽然在上料的时间上他比谢昆炼的那炉钢的上料时间缩短了五分钟。但是，由于班上的协作配合不够紧密，特别是热铁水的供应不及时，拖长了冶炼时间，第一炉钢和谢昆所创造的新纪录比起来，结果在时间上以四分钟之差败下擂来。
    第二天早晨，接班的是冶炼第二班，他们也应擂接战，但是，力不胜敌，一连炼了两炉钢都退阵败北。
    接着，又轮到第三班上班了。擂主谢昆见其他两班都没有赶上来，心里有些着急，他很希望大家都赶上来，只有你追我赶，擂台才打得热闹，只有我赶你追，生产才能天天提高，他检查了自己的缺点，因为上班下班时要忙着交班接班，下了班要开生产会议，他和张文金没有机会碰头交换意见，经验没有及时传播。谢昆创造新纪录有一条重要的经验是：团结协作、紧密配合。他在摆设擂台时把煤气炉、化铁炉等辅助工种的班长请来作“打擂助手”，所以炉前炉后互相配合很好。而张文金昨夜所以败下擂来就是这一点作得差。于是，谢昆便向他下了一张战书，贴在“跃进台”上，上写着：“敬请第一班众英雄豪杰打擂比武。”同时，他还把自己创造新纪录的经验用大字报写了出来，引人注目地贴在“跃进台”上。
    正是：
    互不相让打擂台，
    传播经验本应该，
    团结互助学先进，
    生产红花遍地开。
    晚上，第一班的工人在学习室里见了谢昆写的“请帖式”的战书，个个横枪跃马，争先上阵，张文金学习了谢昆找“打擂助手”的经验，更加信心百倍。在大家讨论第二次应擂时，他依然把拳头一捏：“好呀，追上去！今晚一定要把老谢请下擂来！”
    说着，他们便写了这样一首战歌贴在“跃进台”上，以表示自己最大的决心。
    战鼓咚咚响，
    英雄上战场，
    要创冶炼新纪录，
    多炼优质钢。
    不把谢昆打下擂，
    不算本领强！
    马上，工人们便在炼钢炉旁开始了紧张的生产战斗。张文金亲自指挥督战，带头冲锋。轮班党支部书记宋金光也出马“催粮压阵”，负责催督热铁水的及时供应。化铁炉班长和鼓风房的工人也紧密协作。三小时以后，一场恶战便暂告结束，炉后的钟声响了，白热的钢水从炉口奔腾而出，顿时，盛钢桶便飞溅起千万颗美丽的火星。
    这时候，张文金把出钢的纪录一看，便将身一跃，飞上擂台，“刷”的一下把谢昆的新纪录扯下来。
    现在，这个比多、快、好、省、安全的“快速炼钢擂台”正打得难解难分。整个车间正卷在一个充满英雄气概的竞赛浪潮中，正是：
    马丁炉旁摆战场，
    多快好省赛炼钢，
    个个磨拳齐擦掌，
    人人劲大志昂扬，
    你追我赶争擂主，
    智勇双全武艺强，
    炼钢天天传喜报，
    生产红花开满堂。
