Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 3rd: According to TASS, the "Chronicle" published in San Francisco wrote that a growing number of American entrepreneurs now advocate lifting the trade embargo against the People's Republic of China. They believe that this embargo is a "harmful and obvious evil scheme."

The newspaper specifically cited the statement made last week by Cyril Magnin, director of the San Francisco Port Authority. Magnin called for the restoration of consumer goods trade between the United States and China.

The newspaper finally emphasized that anyone who hinders the development of trade between the People's Republic of China and the United States is "closing their eyes and not seeing the transformation of all relationships in recent years."

    许多美国企业家
    要求同我国贸易
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：在旧金山出版的“纪事报”写道，美国现在有越来越多的企业家主张取消对中华人民共和国的贸易禁运，他们认为这种禁运是“有害的、明显的罪恶计谋”。
    这家报纸特别援引了旧金山港务局局长西里尔·马宁上周所作的声明。马宁呼吁恢复美国同中国的消费品贸易。
    报纸最后着重指出，凡是阻碍中华人民共和国同美国之间的贸易发展的人都是“闭着眼睛看不见近几年来人们一切关系的转变”。
