    Titles Changed
    Mu Lin
    When cadres were first sent to the countryside, the peasants addressed them very politely by their official titles – “Director Zhang,” “Section Chief Li.” Later, this gradually changed to “Comrade Zhang,” “Comrade Li.” After another period of time, the peasants affectionately called them “Old Zhang,” “Old Li,” and then simply, like family members, without any restraint, calling them “Brother Zhang,” “Brother Li.” How one is addressed may not seem like a big deal, but it reflects a profound change in the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the process of eating, living, and working alongside the peasants, they have established a deep revolutionary friendship. This is also a sign of shedding airs and gradually becoming one with the masses in thought, style, and life.
    However, it is said that some cadres, especially intellectual cadres, still feel a bit uncomfortable with this affectionate way of being addressed by the peasants. They believe that being called “Comrade” is acceptable, but being called “Old Zhang” or “Old Li” is somewhat disrespectful, and being called “Brother” seems vulgar. We should examine what is meant by "respect." If the peasants superficially "respect" you by calling you "Director" or "Section Chief," but in reality, they keep you at arm's length, what can you gain from such "respect" other than being detached from the masses? This affectionate way of addressing them by the peasants precisely demonstrates their loyalty and sincerity, and it expresses their respect for the cadres. It seems that those who like to nitpick about "titles" have not truly shed their former cadre airs, have not engaged with the peasants as ordinary people, and have not truly integrated with them.
    Of course, whether a cadre has shed airs and established the thoughts and feelings of the working people is not entirely reflected in how the peasants address the cadres and the attitudes of the cadres towards how the peasants address them. However, those who consider themselves special, superior, and desire respect always have a certain distance from the masses. Let the peasants always use the affectionate and simple words "Old Zhang," "Old Li," "Brother," to address us!

    称呼变了
    木林
    下放干部刚到农村的时候，农民都非常客气的称呼干部的职衔——“张部长”、“李科长”，以后渐渐改称为“张同志”、“李同志”。又经过一个时期以后，农民便亲切地称呼“老张”、“老李”了，后来便干脆如同一家人一样毫无拘束地称起“张大哥”、“李大哥”来。看来怎样称呼似乎不是什么了不起的问题，然而可以看出干部同群众的关系是在发生深刻变化。他们在同吃同住同劳动的过程中同农民建立了深厚的革命友谊，这也是放下架子，在思想、作风、生活上逐渐群众化的一种标志。
    但是，据说有些干部、尤其是知识分子干部，对农民这种亲切的称呼，还有些感到不太舒服。他们认为，称呼同志还可以，称呼“老张”、“老李”就有些不够尊重，称呼老兄老弟那就显得庸俗了。我们倒要看一看什么叫做“尊重”。假如农民表面上对你很“尊重”地称呼你“部长”、“科长”，而实际上却对你敬而远之，那末，这样的“尊重”除了使你脱离群众之外，还会得到什么呢？农民这种亲切的称呼，正是表现了农民那种忠诚朴实的本色，正是表现了对干部的尊重。看来，那些爱挑剔“称呼”的人还没有真正放下原来的干部架子，没有以一个普通人的身分去同农民接触，没有真正和农民打成一片。
    当然衡量一个干部是否放下了架子，是否树立了劳动人民的思想感情，并不完全表现在农民对干部怎样称呼和干部对农民称呼所持的态度上，不过凡是自视特殊，高人一等，喜人尊重的人，他们总是和群众有一定距离的。让农民永远用“老张”、“老李”、“大哥”、“老弟”这个亲切朴实的字眼称呼我们吧！
