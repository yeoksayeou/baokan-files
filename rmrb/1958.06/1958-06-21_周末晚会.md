    Weekend Evening Party
    Liu Peihang
    On a weekend evening in early summer, I attended the "Weekend Evening Party" regularly held by the Hongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, Beijing.

    A gas lamp was hung under an ancient pine tree, illuminating this "venue." The choir members forgot the fatigue of a day's work and sang the self-composed "Attendance Song" loudly.

    At the evening party,社員 Wang Yongshun sang a solo of his own song "Transmitting the General Line, My Heart is So Happy". Students in the agricultural middle school who work and study part-time also turned their happy daily lives of learning and labor into a dance – "A Day's Life" which was performed at the evening party. When the choir of the Seventh Production Team sang the literacy song "How Good It Would Be If He Could Read," an old lady in her fifties, surnamed Fan, and her daughter-in-law also sang vigorously along. This old lady Fan is not only skilled in production and singing, but also an active participant in literacy efforts. She insists on studying every day, has now learned more than 500 characters, and is determined to work with all the illiterate people in the township to shed their illiteracy in 180 days and become new farmers with culture. The performances of the children's team were even more interesting. Wang Xiaosan, with two small braids, was just over seven years old. She waved her small fists calmly and commanded the children to sing the song "Little Chicken, Little Duck" with varying degrees of strength.

    The members requested song after song. They sang more than 30 programs including short and pithy clapper talks, comic dialogues, and songs, praising the general line and singing out their comfortable feelings about the great leap in production and the great cultural turn-over.

    In this cooperative, the production team is also the choir, and more than 400 people regularly participate in singing activities. Regardless of age, they sing with smiles on their faces in the fields or on the streets. The daily singing practice never stops.

    周末晚会
    刘佩衡
    在初夏的一个周末夜晚，我参加了北京市昌平区永丰屯乡宏丰农业社经常举办的“周末晚会”。
    在一棵苍松下悬挂着一盏汽灯，照亮了这个“会场”。歌咏队员们忘掉了一天劳动的疲劳，响亮地唱着自编的“出勤歌”。
    晚会上，社员王永顺独唱了自己编写的歌曲“传来总路线心里好喜欢”。在农业中学半工半读的学生们也把他们每天学习、劳动的幸福生活编成舞蹈——“一天的生活”在晚会上表演出来。当第七生产队的歌咏队演唱扫盲歌“他要识字该多好”时，一个五十多岁的姓范的老太太和她的儿媳也在一边起劲地唱起来。这位范老太太不仅是生产、唱歌的能手，也是扫盲的积极分子，她每天都坚持学习，现在已经学会了五百多字，并且决心和全乡的文盲一道要在一百八十天摘掉文盲帽子，做个有文化的新农民。幼儿队的孩子们的表演更令人兴趣，梳着两个小辫的王小三，刚七岁多，她不慌不忙地挥着小拳头，有强有弱地指挥着小朋友唱“小鸡小鸭”的歌曲。
    社员们要求演唱的一个接着一个。他们演唱了短小精悍的快板、相声、歌曲等三十多个节目，歌颂了总路线，也唱出生产大跃进和文化大翻身的舒畅心情。
    在这个合作社，生产队就是歌咏队，已有四百多人经常参加歌咏活动。不论年纪老少，在田间或街头都笑容满面地歌唱。每天练歌的活动，从不间断。
