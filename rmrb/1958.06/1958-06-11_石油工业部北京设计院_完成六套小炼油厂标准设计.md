    Beijing Design Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry
    Completes Standard Design for Six Small Refineries

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Beijing Design Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has recently completed six sets of standard designs for small-scale artificial petroleum factories that are most suitable for counties and townships. The greatest advantage of these standard designs is that, due to attention being paid to the comprehensive utilization of resources, they can not only produce various oil products but also recover chemical fertilizers. Taking the smallest factory with a production capacity of 300 tons of shale oil as an example, it can recover 54 tons of crystalline ammonium sulfate annually. These fertilizers can increase grain production by more than 300,000 jin.
    These six sets of small refinery designs all use oil shale or coal, which are abundant in China, as raw materials. The production capacities are 300 tons, 1,000 tons, and 3,000 tons respectively. The production method is also very simple. Just pile the coal or shale into a shaped pile on the ground, ignite the top of the pile, and burn the coal or shale on the top surface to reach the temperature of dry distillation. Then, extract the gas and tar gas obtained from the dry distillation through the iron pipe at the bottom of the pile and enter the recovery system for recovery. This small factory also has processing equipment that can refine kerosene, light diesel, heavy diesel, and other oil products. Its by-products, such as paraffin wax and coke, can also be supplied to the metallurgical or chemical industry as raw materials and fuels.
    The designers strived for simplicity in the design, so the small factories built with this standard design have simple equipment and require little investment. For example, a piled dry distillation factory with an annual output of 3,000 tons of coal tar requires less than 20 tons of steel for all equipment and materials, and the investment is only more than 75,000 yuan. A county with a population of 200,000 can run such a small coal refining plant for an average of less than four jiao per person. After completion, the annual output of heavy diesel will be 1,980 tons, semi-coke will be 31,000 tons, and coke will be 570 tons. The entire investment can be recovered in less than a year.
    Currently, the standard designs for these small petroleum plants have been duplicated and distributed to various regions.

    完成六套小炼油厂标准设计
    本报讯　石油工业部北京设计院最近完成了六套最适于县乡级的小型人造石油工厂的标准设计。这些标准设计的厂的最大好处是：由于注意了资源的综合利用，既能生产各种油品，又能回收化学肥料。以生产能力为三百吨页岩油的最小型工厂计算，每年就能回收五十四吨结晶硫铵，这些肥料可以增产三十多万斤粮食。
    这六套小型炼油厂的设计都是以我国资源很丰富的油页岩或煤做原料。生产能力分别为三百吨、一千吨和三千吨。生产方法也很简易，只需在地上堆成定型的煤或页岩堆，从堆顶点火，把顶面的煤或页岩燃着，使它达到干馏的温度，然后通过堆底的铁管把干馏所得的瓦斯、焦油气体等抽出，进入回收系统回收。这种小型厂中还附有加工设备，可以炼制煤油、轻柴油、重柴油等各种油品。其副产品石蜡和焦炭等，也都可以供给冶金或化学工业做原料和燃料。
    设计人员在设计时力求因陋就简，因此用这种标准设计建设的小型厂设备简单，投资也很少。如年产三千吨煤焦油的成堆干馏工厂，全部设备器材所需的钢材不到二十吨，投资只要七万五千多元。一个二十万人口的县，平均每人不到四角钱，就能办这样一个小煤炼油厂。而建成后每年所得的重柴油就有一千九百八十吨、半焦三万一千吨、焦炭五百七十吨。全部投资不到一年就能收回。
    现在，这批小型石油厂的标准设计都已复印出来，并且已经发给各地。
