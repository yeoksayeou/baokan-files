    Four Crew Members of the "Tuapse" Return to the Soviet Union
    Accuse US-Chiang Kai-shek of Brutal Crimes
    (Our Moscow dispatch, June 19) Four crew members of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse," which was hijacked to Taiwan by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique of Taiwan, recently returned to the Soviet Union via Brazil. They held a press conference in Moscow on the 18th, accusing the US-Chiang of the brutal persecution they suffered, and once again appealed to social groups in various countries to assist the remaining seven Soviet crew members still detained in Taiwan to return home.
    Since the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" was hijacked to Taiwan by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique on June 23, 1954, the Soviet people have been extremely indignant at this act of piracy, and the fate of the forty-nine Soviet crew members on board the "Tuapse" has been of constant concern to the Soviet government and people. In August 1955, twenty-nine Soviet crew members returned to the Soviet Union, and subsequently another nine crew members were transported to the United States (five of whom returned to the Soviet Union in 1956, while the whereabouts of the other four are unknown).
    These Soviet crew members, who spent four years of hellish life in Taiwan, denounced the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique of Taiwan and the American imperialists in Taiwan to Soviet journalists and foreign journalists stationed in Moscow at the press conference. They used their personal experiences to recount the inhuman lives they lived for four years. The names of the four crew members are: Zbrov, Anfirov, Baikovich, and Gvozdik. Baikovich said: "The painful life of the past four years is indescribable. The US-Chiang agents imprisoned us in prisons in several groups. They used every means to try to dispel our thoughts of returning home. After interrogation, they subjected us to various tortures. Throughout this process, all the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique were carried out together with the American imperialists! An American colonel named Lazarius played a major role."
    The four crew members also exposed the rumors fabricated by the US-Chiang agents. When they were in Taiwan, the US-Chiang agents threatened them, saying that their families had been thrown into prison, and that they would suffer the same fate after returning to the Soviet Union, and at the very least would be distrusted and unable to find work.
    Kudiyanov, who presided over the press conference, said: All the Soviet crew members who returned home have been assigned jobs, and the Soviet government has given great care to their families, and their wages have always been paid as usual. The captain of the "Tuapse" is now working on the "Marshal Ushakov," which travels between Odessa and India.
    At the meeting, the Soviet crew members also said: "There are still seven Soviet crew members left in Taiwan, one of whom, a crew member named Pisanov, was groundlessly imprisoned in a mental hospital, and his life and death are still unknown. The other six are still in prison. We firmly demand that social groups from various countries provide assistance so that they can return to their homeland as soon as possible."
    In addition, the "Tuapse" oil tanker is still in Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has shamelessly repainted the Soviet oil tanker and converted it into a gunboat, with the number "336". The Soviet crew members said that this ship belongs to the Soviet Union and should be returned to the Soviet Union.

    “图阿普斯号”四名船员返回苏联
    控诉美蒋残暴罪行
    本报莫斯科19日电　被美国和台湾蒋介石集团劫夺到台湾的苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的四名船员不久前经巴西回到了苏联。他们于18日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会，控诉了美蒋对他们施行的残酷迫害，并再一次呼吁各国社会团体协助仍被扣留在台湾的另外七名苏联船员回国。
    自从1954年6月23日苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被美国和蒋介石集团劫往台湾后，苏联人民对这种海盗行为异常气愤，“图阿普斯号”船上四十九名苏联船员的命运一直为苏联政府和人民所关怀。1955年8月曾有二十九名苏联船员回到苏联，此后又有九名船员被运往美国（其中五人已于1956年回到苏联，其他四人，下落不明）。
    这些在台湾度过了四年地狱生活的苏联船员，在记者招待会上向苏联记者和驻莫斯科的外国记者们控诉了台湾蒋介石集团以及在台湾的美帝国主义者的罪行。他们用亲身的经历诉说了四年来非人的生活。这四名船员的名字是：兹布罗夫、安非洛夫、拜科维奇和格沃兹吉克。拜科维奇说：“四年来的痛苦生活是难以描述的，美蒋特务把我们分成几批囚在监狱里，他们用尽一切办法想打消我们回国的念头，经过审讯后就对我们进行各种拷打。在这整个过程中，蒋介石集团的一切活动全是与美帝国主义者一起干的！有一个叫拉查里乌斯的美国上校起了主要作用。”
    这四名船员还揭露了美蒋特务的造谣。在台湾时美蒋特务曾威胁他们说，他们的家庭已投入监狱，并且说他们回到苏联后也会遭到同等命运，并且至少是不受信任，找不到工作。
    主持记者招待会的库季扬诺夫说：归国后的苏联船员全都分配了工作，苏联政府对他们的家庭给予了很大的照顾，他们的工薪一向照发。“图阿普斯号”船长现在在“乌沙可夫大将号”上工作，这只船来往于敖德萨和印度之间。
    在会上苏联船员们还说：“现在还有七个苏联船员留在台湾，其中一个叫彼萨诺夫的船员，无缘无故地被关在疯人病院，至今生死不明。其他六个人仍在监狱里。我们坚决要求各国的社会团体进行帮助，能使他们早日回到祖国的怀抱。”
    另外，“图阿普斯号”油船仍然留在台湾，蒋介石集团无耻地把这只苏联油船改涂颜色，并且改装成炮舰，它的号码是“3 3 6”。苏联船员说，这只船是苏联的，它应当归还苏联。
