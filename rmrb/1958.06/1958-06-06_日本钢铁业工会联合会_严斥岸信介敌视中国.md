Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: Representatives of the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Labor Union Federation today submitted a letter of protest to the Nobusuke Kishi government on behalf of 120,000 iron and steel industry workers, strongly protesting the Nobusuke Kishi government's adoption of a policy of hostility towards China.

The protest letter demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately change its attitude, retract all remarks that have caused the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, and apologize to China for the flag desecration incident. The protest letter also demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government provide unconditional guarantees for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and sincerely strive to expand Sino-Japanese trade.

The protest letter pointed out that the responsibility for the failure to implement the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the Sino-Japanese Iron and Steel Barter Agreement, as well as the complete stagnation of Sino-Japanese trade, should be borne by the Nobusuke Kishi government. The protest letter strongly condemned Nobusuke Kishi's hostile attitude towards China as contrary to the Japanese people's desire for independence and peace, and making the Japanese economic crisis even more profound. The protest letter demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as soon as possible, and restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The "Iron and Steel Labor Union" also demanded that capitalists of the five major steel companies, including Yawata Iron & Steel Co., unite and work together to urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to change its hostile attitude towards China so that the Sino-Japanese Iron and Steel Barter Agreement can be implemented as soon as possible.

    日本钢铁业工会联合会
    严斥岸信介敌视中国
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本钢铁产业工会联合会的代表今天代表十二万钢铁产业工人向岸信介政府递交抗议书，严重抗议岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策。
    抗议书要求岸信介政府立即改变态度，取消一切造成日中关系恶化的发言，并且就侮辱中国国旗事件对中国赔罪。抗议书同时要求岸信介政府对实施第四次日中贸易协定给予无条件的保证，有诚意地为扩展日中贸易而努力。
    抗议书指出，第四次日中贸易协定和日中钢铁易货协议不能付诸实施，和日中贸易陷入全面停顿的责任应该由岸信介政府承担。抗议书强烈指责说，岸信介敌视中国的态度违背了日本人民争取独立与和平的愿望，并且使日本经济危机更加深刻化。抗议书要求岸信介政府断绝同台湾蒋介石集团的关系，尽速承认中华人民共和国政府，恢复日中两国邦交。
    “钢铁工联”同时还要求八幡制铁公司等五大钢铁公司的资本家团结一致努力促使岸信介政府改变敌视中国的态度，以使日中钢铁易货协议能够早日付诸实施。
