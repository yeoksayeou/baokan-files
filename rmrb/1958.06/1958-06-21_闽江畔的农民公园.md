    Farmer Parks on the Banks of the Min River
    Recently, sixteen farmer parks have been built along the scenic Min River. These parks were created by members of twelve agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Fuzhou, including Yangqi, Xin'an, and Pukou, through voluntary labor.
    The parks are tranquil and beautiful, some built in shady orchards, others on hillsides by the river. They feature flowerbeds, stone chairs, stone tables, stone lions, artificial hills, and goldfish ponds. There are also small pavilions with chess sets, billiards, and other games for visitors to enjoy. Loudspeakers, blackboard newspapers, picture display boards, and bulletin boards installed in the parks frequently attract crowds of visitors. Now, in the season of blooming flowers, clusters of crabapples, peonies, roses, monthly roses, and colorful dianthus are blooming in the flowerbeds, scattering rich fragrances. At noon and in the evening, the area is bustling with activity. After work, farmers gather in groups of three to five, bringing the old and the young, to enjoy the scenery of the park and listen to beautiful songs and current affairs broadcasts.
    Recently, the parks have been as lively as if celebrating a festival, with huge crowds gathering every night to watch the performances of the General Line Art Propaganda Teams from the agricultural cooperatives' clubs. The park is a place for farmers to stroll, chat, and enjoy the scenery, as well as a venue for General Line propaganda activities. Huang Zhanliu, a member of the Shangbao Agricultural Cooperative, wrote a poem praising the park: "In the past, this was a barren slope, now it has become a beautiful little park, surrounded by roses, with exotic flowers and grasses planted on the edges, stone lions, stone chairs, and stone tables, artificial hills arranged so completely, working hard during the day, enjoying entertainment in the park in the evening." Chen Haoyuan, a seventy-three-year-old member of the Yangqi Agricultural Cooperative, voluntarily requested to manage the flowerbeds in the park for free. He said that he had never heard of building parks in the countryside before, and only today's society can do it. He also said that the countryside is like the city, the city has parks, and we in the countryside also have parks.

    闽江畔的农民公园
    景色秀丽的闽江畔，新近修建起十六个农民公园。这些公园是福州市郊区阳岐、新安、浦口等十二个农业生产合作社的社员们义务开辟出来的。
    公园环境恬静幽美，有的修建在绿树成荫的果园内，有的建立在河旁的小山坡上。内有花圃、石椅、石桌、石狮、假山和金鱼池。园里还有小亭，亭内放置着象棋、康乐球等供游人玩乐。装置在公园里的扩音器、黑板报、图片宣传栏和贴报处，时常吸引成群的游人。现在，正是百花盛开、万紫千红季节，园内花圃里一丛丛海棠、芍药、蔷薇、月季、玫瑰、五彩石竹，开放着红、白、紫各色花儿，播散着馥郁的香气。中午、夜间这里到处呈现一片热闹景象。农民们在劳动后，三、五成群，扶老携幼，汇集到这里来欣赏公园景色，收听那优美动听的歌曲和时事广播。
    近日来，公园像庆祝节日一样热闹，每个晚上都是人山人海，观看农业社俱乐部的总路线文艺宣传队的文艺表演。公园是农民散步、谈心、欣赏景色的地方，也是总路线宣传活动的场所。尚保农业社社员黄占鎏编了一首赞扬公园的诗：“从前这里一块荒坡地，现在变成美丽小公园，周围种满玫瑰花，奇花异草栽边缘，石狮、石椅和石桌，假山排设真周全，白天勤劳动，晚间娱乐在公园。”阳岐农业社社员陈浩元，今年已七十三岁了，他自动向农业社要求义务管理公园里的花圃。他说，过去从没听说过农村要修建公园的事，只有今天的社会才能办到。他还说，农村好比城市，城市有公园，我们农村也有公园了。
