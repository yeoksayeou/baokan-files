Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The textile machinery manufacturing sector is stepping up its efforts to rush-produce a large number of new textile equipment in order to promote China's modern textile industry, which has a 70-year history, to ride on a swift horse of new technology and sprint forward. According to the plan recently formulated by the National Textile Machinery Industry Great Leap Forward Conference, within three years, all equipment for wool, linen, silk, and chemical fibers that originally needed to be imported will be supplied domestically; newly built cotton textile factories will also be equipped with the latest technology of high-speed, automation, and continuous operation.

In the next two years, of the more than 700 types of textile machinery used in the world that China cannot yet manufacture, more than 500 types will be trial-manufactured and put into production. Among them, the blank spots in wool, linen, silk, and viscose fiber should be filled first to meet the needs of the comprehensive development of China's textile industry.

The textile machinery industry is one of the fastest-growing industrial sectors in China since liberation. It has grown from repair shops. During the First Five-Year Plan period, it not only supplied complete sets of equipment for building 2.5 million spindles of cotton textile factories, but also supplied some for export. However, due to the weak foundation in the past, and insufficient attention to the development of wool, linen, silk, and viscose fiber during the First Five-Year Plan period, complete sets of equipment for these sectors cannot yet be manufactured. At present, complete sets of wool textile printing and dyeing equipment have been designed and can be manufactured in large quantities next year. Viscose fiber equipment will be imitated according to Soviet drawings. In the silk industry, new automated silk reeling equipment is being trial-manufactured. The adoption of this automated equipment will not only improve silk reeling efficiency, but also greatly improve the working conditions of silk reeling workers. In the cotton textile industry, new equipment such as combing machines for spinning high-count yarns, looms for weaving wide fabrics, and printing and dyeing high-grade varieties will also be manufactured one after another.

    跨上骏马为技术革命开道
    五百种新式纺织机械正在试制
    据新华社22日讯  纺织机械制造部门正加紧赶制大批新式纺织设备，以促使我国具有七十年历史的现代化纺织工业，跨上新技术的骏马飞奔向前。根据最近全国纺织机械工业跃进会议制定的规划，在三年之内，原来需要进口的毛、麻、丝、化学纤维等设备将全部由国内供应；新建棉纺织厂也将由高速化、自动化、连续化的最新技术装备起来。
    今明两年，要将世界上应用的七百多种各类纺织机械中我国尚不能制造的五百多种试制出来投入生产。其中首先要弥补毛、麻、丝及粘胶纤维等空白点，满足我国纺织工业全面发展的需要。
    纺织机械工业是我国解放后发展得最迅速的工业部门之一。它从修配厂的基础上成长起来，在第一个五年计划期间不仅供应了建设二百五十万锭棉纺织厂的全套设备，还有一部分供应出口。但是由于过去基础薄弱，以及在第一个五年计划期间对毛、麻、丝及粘胶纤维发展注意不够，这几个部门的全套设备目前还不能制造。目前，全套毛纺织印染设备都已设计完毕，明年就可以大量制造，粘胶纤维设备将按苏联图纸进行仿造。丝绸工业方面正在试制新式自动化缫丝设备，采用这种自动化设备，不仅提高缫丝效率，还将大大改善缫丝工人的劳动条件。在棉纺织业中，像纺高支纱用的精梳机、织宽幅布的织机、印染高级品种等新式设备也都要陆续制造。
