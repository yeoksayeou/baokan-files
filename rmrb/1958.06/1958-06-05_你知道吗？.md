    Did you know?
    When did China start having hoes? As early as the Stone Age, but at that time it was made of stone. The "sectioned stone hoes" unearthed in Fujian and Guangdong were stone hoes fitted with handles. There were bronze hoes in the Bronze Age. The iron-mouthed hoes and concave iron-mouthed hoes of the Warring States period discovered by the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1950 during the excavation of the Warring States tomb in Guweicun Village, Huixian County, Henan Province, can be said to be the close ancestors of the hoes we use today.

    我国从什么时候开始有锄头的呢？早在石器时代就有了，不过当时它是石制的。福建、广东一带出土的“有段石?”系装柄的石锄。铜器时代有铜锄。1950年中国科学院考古研究所在发掘河南辉县固围村战国墓地时发现的战国时代的铁口锄和凹字形铁口锄可说是我们现在所用的锄头的近祖。
