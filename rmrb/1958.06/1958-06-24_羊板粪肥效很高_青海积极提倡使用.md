    Sheep Dung Manure Has High Fertilizer Efficiency
    Qinghai Actively Promotes its Use
    (Our dispatch) Qinghai Province is vigorously promoting the application of sheep dung.
    According to scientific analysis, sheep dung is one of the most effective farmyard manures. Calculated based on the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium elements it contains, the fertilizer efficiency of one ton of sheep dung is equivalent to 150 jin of ammonium sulfate, 100 jin of ammonium phosphate, and 80 jin of superphosphate, but the price of sheep dung (Xining city price) is 11.9% cheaper than these chemical fertilizers. According to experienced farmers and herdsmen, each head of large and small-tailed sheep can accumulate an average of about 700 jin of pure sheep dung or 12,800 jin of pen manure annually. After deducting the grazing season in summer and autumn, and the areas where transportation is inconvenient and cannot be utilized, or temporarily cannot be utilized as fertilizer for other reasons, if 20% to 25% can be utilized this year, this item alone could allow the entire province to accumulate 1.8 billion to 2.2 billion jin of pure sheep dung, or 30 billion to 40 billion jin of pen manure. The provincial average could apply 240 to 300 jin of pure sheep dung or 4,000 to 5,000 jin of pen manure per mu (calculated based on the province's 7 million mu of cultivated land), which can increase grain production considerably.

    羊板粪肥效很高
    青海积极提倡使用
    本报讯  青海省大力提倡施用羊板粪。
    根据科学的化验分析，羊板粪是农家肥料中肥效最高的一种。按所含的氮、磷、钾元素计算，每吨羊板粪的肥效，相当于一百五十斤硫酸铵，一百斤磷酸铵，八十斤过磷酸钙等化学肥料，而羊粪价格（西宁市价格）比这些化学肥料还便宜11.9％。据有经验的农、牧民介绍，大小山、绵羊每年每头平均可积净羊粪约七百斤或圈肥一万二千八百斤，除去夏秋季节放牧和部分地区交通不便不能被利用，或因其他原因暂时不能被利用作肥料外，今年若能利用20％至25％，仅此一项，全省一年则可积净羊板粪十八亿至二十二亿市斤，或圈肥三百亿至四百亿市斤，全省平均可亩施净羊粪二百四十至三百市斤或圈肥四千至五千市斤（按全省七百万亩播种面积计算），能增产相当多的粮食。
