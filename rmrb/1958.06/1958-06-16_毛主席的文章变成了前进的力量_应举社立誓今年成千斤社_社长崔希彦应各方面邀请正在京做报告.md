Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 15th: (By our reporter Yu Minsheng) After seeing and hearing about Chairman Mao's article introducing their cooperative in "Red Flag" magazine, all members of the Yingju Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, were invigorated, full of fighting spirit, and high-spirited. They vowed to continue working hard and diligently to achieve a "thousand-jin cooperative" this year and once again report the good news to Chairman Mao.

When this reporter arrived at the cooperative on the 11th, I saw that the members had already copied Chairman Mao's article in conspicuous black characters on the whitewashed walls along the street. Over the past few days, the Party members, Youth League members, and cooperative members have been holding meetings day and night to study and discuss the Party's general line for socialist construction and Chairman Mao's article. They said with extraordinary excitement and joy, "We must preserve this glorious red flag and never let it fade!"

In this cooperative, there is no sign of anyone idling. After the intense wheat harvest, people are engaged in intense summer planting. Currently, the members are converting 2,830 mu of dry land (68% of the cooperative's cultivated land area) into paddy fields. This is an unprecedented initiative in the cooperative's production, and people are placing their hopes for a bumper harvest on these paddy fields. They walk in teams to the paddy fields to plant rice seedlings from three or four in the morning until dusk before returning home. After dinner, they return to the fields, under the starry sky, accompanied by rhythmic songs, pulling seedlings in the nursery fields to prepare for completing more transplanting tasks the next day. Although the labor is intense, the members are all energetic and full of vigor. The cooperative's transplanting efficiency has also increased from 50 mu per day in the past to 215 mu.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Cui Xiyan, the chairman of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, who is currently attending the Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference in Beijing, has recently been invited by some organizations, groups, schools, and military units in Beijing to give several reports on the "experience of relying on collective strength to overcome natural disasters and organize a comprehensive great leap forward." Dozens of units are also organizing to listen to recorded reports. Everyone who heard the report praised it highly, saying that Cui Xiyan's report is a Marxist-Leninist report that is both "red" and expert, and a vivid socialist education. Teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University, after listening to the report, wanted to invite Cui Xiyan to teach at the university. To meet the needs of all parties, Cui Xiyan's report is scheduled to continue until mid-month.

    毛主席的文章变成了前进的力量
    应举社立誓今年成千斤社
    社长崔希彦应各方面邀请正在京做报告
    据新华社郑州15日电　本社记者于民生报道：河南省封丘县应举社的全体社员在看到和听到毛主席在“红旗”杂志上介绍他们合作社的文章后，人人精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。他们立下誓言，要继续大干、苦干，在今年实现千斤社，再次向毛主席报喜。
    记者于11日到达这个合作社时，看到社员们已经把毛主席的文章，用醒目的黑笔字抄写在粉白的沿街墙壁上。这里的党员、团员和社员们，几天以来连夜开会，学习和讨论党提出的社会主义建设总路线以及毛主席的文章。他们怀着异常激动和喜悦的心情说，我们一定要保住这面光荣的红旗，使它永不褪色！
    在这个合作社里，看不到一个游手好闲的人，人们在紧张的麦收以后，正在进行紧张的夏种工作。目前社员们正在把二千八百三十亩旱地（占全社耕地面积的68％）改成水稻田，这是这个合作社生产上的一个史无前例的创举，人们把丰收的希望寄托在这些水稻田上。他们从早上三四点钟就成队地走到水田里去插秧，直到黄昏才回家。晚饭后，又回到田间，顶着满天星斗，伴随着有节奏的歌声，在育苗田里拔秧苗，为第二天完成更多的插秧任务作准备工作。劳动虽然紧张，但是社员们个个生龙活虎，干劲十足。全社插秧效率也由过去的每天五十亩，提高到二百一十五亩。
    据新华社讯　正在北京出席第四次全国民政会议的河南省封丘县应举农业社社长崔希彦，最近应北京的一些机关、团体、学校、部队等的邀请，先后做了几次有关“依靠集体力量战胜灾荒组织全面大跃进的经验”的报告。有几十个单位还正在组织听录音报告。所有听到报告的人都极为赞扬，说崔希彦的报告是一篇马列主义红专的报告，是一次生动的社会主义教育。北京农业大学的师生听过报告，要请崔希彦到农业大学任教。为了满足各方面的要求，崔希彦的报告计划进行到本月中旬。
