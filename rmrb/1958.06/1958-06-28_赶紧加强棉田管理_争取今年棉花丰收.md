Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: Most of the cotton fields across the country have begun to bud, and the struggle to achieve a bumper cotton harvest this year has entered an extremely important and crucial stage. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua News Agency reporters: A bumper cotton harvest depends on this. The most urgent task now is to mobilize and organize sufficient forces to continuously strengthen mid- and late-stage management of cotton fields.

The Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson said: The cotton planting area this year is around 90 million mu, which is about the same as in 1956, and only slightly more than last year by 3 million mu. Therefore, the major increase in cotton production mainly relies on universally improving the yield per unit area. Judging from the current cotton field management and cotton seedling growth, the concentrated cotton-producing areas are better, while the scattered cotton-producing areas are worse. However, the scattered cotton-producing areas account for a considerable proportion of all cotton fields.

The spokesperson then introduced the seedling management situation in cotton fields across the country. He said: Cotton was generally planted earlier and better this year, and a large amount of base fertilizer was applied, resulting in uniform and robust emergence of cotton seedlings. Around May 10th, northern cotton-producing areas suffered a wind-freeze disaster, while the Yangtze River basin cotton-producing areas experienced continuous rain from late April to mid-May. Low ground temperatures in both the north and south slowed cotton seedling growth, and some diseases occurred. However, before the summer harvest, the seedling management of cotton fields across the country was generally good. Various regions carried out seedling checks and transplanting in the affected cotton fields to ensure full stands. Subsequently, various regions also seized the time to carry out thinning, weeding, aphid control, and topdressing. After the summer harvest, due to labor shortages, grass overgrowth and soil compaction occurred in some areas (mainly scattered cotton-producing areas). Aphid damage has not completely subsided. In major cotton-producing counties such as Yanshi and Lingbao in Henan, and Weinan in Shaanxi, some agricultural cooperatives are suffering from severe aphid damage. In some areas, such as the Guanzhong and northern Henan cotton-producing areas, mid- and late-stage cotton pests such as red spiders, blind bugs, and cotton bollworms have also occurred. More serious are the two issues of seedling establishment and the current drought. Due to low temperatures and numerous diseases during the seedling stage, seedling establishment in a large portion of cotton fields this year is generally later than in previous years. Currently, the Nanyang area in Henan, northern and eastern Henan, northern and southeastern Hebei, Shandong, and parts of Jiangsu are experiencing severe drought. Some cotton seedlings planted in wheat fields in parts of Hebei and Shandong are dying. Failure to promptly establish seedlings, combat drought, control pests, weed, and apply topdressing will affect this year's cotton production increase.

Regarding current cotton field management, the spokesperson said: First, we must learn from the experience of seedling management, continue to strengthen the Party's leadership in cotton production work, organize forces, put forward measures and requirements, and organize visits and comparisons to quickly manage cotton fields well. Agricultural cooperatives should specifically arrange labor and assign special personnel to be responsible for cotton field management. Currently, Hubei and Henan have held cotton field management conferences in cotton-producing areas. Henan has put forward the slogan "Work hard for fifty days, blitz for half a month," and has proposed the requirements of completely eliminating grass overgrowth and soil compaction, eliminating pests and diseases, eliminating third-class seedlings, ensuring no drought or flooding, and eliminating excessive buds and crazy branches. This should be implemented and promoted throughout the country's cotton-producing areas.

The spokesperson said: Grasping cotton field management also requires grasping both ends. Grasp the work of producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, 100 jin of lint cotton per mu, and eliminating third-class seedlings. High-yield cotton fields should be subject to specific management measures according to the field, and management of the vast cotton fields should be promoted through grasping both ends and comparisons.

The spokesperson said: Pest control, cultivation, and topdressing are three key factors for high cotton yields. If pest control can be carried out thoroughly, cotton production can be increased by 30%-40%. It is hoped that various regions will use existing machinery and equipment in combination with indigenous methods and medicines to achieve universal, timely, and thorough treatment, and never relax vigilance against pest infestations. Cotton is a crop that needs to be cultivated many times. Farmers say, "Cotton cultivated eight times yields bolls like strings of garlic." It is necessary to organize labor as much as possible to cultivate more times to ensure there is no grass overgrowth or soil compaction. In the past, it was generally cultivated four or five times; this year, it is required to be done six, seven, or even eight or nine times. In terms of fertilization, the "five applications and two supplements" proposed by Hubei is good. The so-called five applications are one base fertilizer application, one seed fertilizer application at the time of sowing, and three topdressing applications before budding, at budding, and at flowering. The two supplements are two topdressing applications for weaker cotton seedlings during the seedling stage. The three topdressing applications are very important for high cotton yields, and it is hoped that various regions will strive to achieve them. As for technical measures such as removing excessive buds and pruning branches, they must also be done in a timely manner. In addition, various regions should also pay attention to doing a good job in cotton field drainage facilities before the rainy season arrives.

The spokesperson concluded by saying: Cotton was planted well this year, and seedling management was generally good. As long as we work hard to promptly implement mid- and late-stage management measures for cotton fields, we will definitely achieve a bumper harvest and be able to create amazing high-yield records.

### 赶紧加强棉田管理  争取今年棉花丰收

    赶紧加强棉田管理
    争取今年棉花丰收
    据新华社27日讯　全国棉田大部分已经开始现蕾，争取今年棉花大丰收的斗争进入了极端重要的关键时期。农业部发言人向新华社记者说：棉花大丰收在此一举。当前最迫切的是发动和组织足够的力量，不间断地加强对棉田的中期和后期管理。
    农业部发言人说：今年棉花种植面积九千万亩左右，和1956年差不多，比去年只增加三百多万亩，因此争取棉花产量大跃进主要依靠普遍提高单位面积产量。根据目前棉田管理和棉苗生长情况看，集中棉区好些，分散棉区差些；但是，分散棉区在全部棉田中占有相当的比重。
    接着发言人介绍了全国棉田苗期管理情况。他说：今年棉花普遍种得早和种得好，而且大量增施了基肥，棉苗出土整齐而且茁壮。北方棉区在5月10日左右遭了一场风冻灾害，长江流域棉区4月下旬到5月中旬阴雨连绵，北方南方都因地温低棉苗生长缓慢，并且发生了一些病害。但在夏收以前，全国棉田的苗期管理基本上是好的，各地都对受害棉田进行了查苗和移补，保证了全苗。接着各地都抓紧了间苗、锄草、治蚜、追肥等工作。夏收到来后由于劳力紧张，部分地区（主要是分散棉区）发生了草荒、土壤板结的现象。蚜虫为害还未完全过去，主要产棉县如河南偃师、灵宝，陕西渭南，有些农业社蚜虫为害严重；有些地方如关中、豫北棉区，棉花中后期的害虫红蜘蛛、盲椿象、棉铃虫等又发生了。更严重的是定苗和当前的旱象两个问题。由于苗期气温低病害多，今年有很大一部分棉田定苗一般比往年为迟。目前河南南阳地区和豫北、河北北部和东南部、山东、江苏部分地区旱象严重。河北、山东部分在麦田中间种的棉苗有死苗的现象。如不及时定苗、抗旱、治虫、锄草和追肥，就将影响今年棉花的跃进增产。
    关于当前的棉田管理，发言人说：首先要吸取苗期管理的经验，继续加强党对棉花生产工作的领导，组织力量，提出措施和要求，并组织参观评比，迅速把棉田管好。农业社要具体安排劳力，专人负责抓棉田管理工作。现在，湖北和河南都已分别在棉区开了棉田管理会议，河南提出了“大干五十天、突击半个月”的口号，提出了彻底消灭草荒与土壤板结、消灭病虫害、消灭三类苗、无旱无涝和没有赘芽、疯杈现象的要求。这在全国棉区都应该贯彻推行。
  发言人说：抓棉田管理也要抓两头。抓千斤籽棉田、百斤皮棉田和抓消灭三类苗的工作。丰产棉田应按田订具体的管理措施，通过抓两头和评比来推动广大棉田的管理。
    发言人说：治虫、中耕和追肥是棉花丰产的三个关键。如能彻底治虫，棉花就能增产30％—40％。希望各地利用现有药械结合土法土药，尽量作到普遍治、及时治和彻底治，一刻也不要放松对虫情的警惕。棉花是需要多锄的作物，农民说“棉花锄八遍，结桃如蒜辫”，要尽可能组织劳力多锄，保证没有草荒和土壤板结现象。往年一般锄四、五次，今年要求作到六、七次甚至八、九次。在施肥方面，湖北提出的“五施两补”是好的。所谓五施是一次基肥，一次播种时的种肥，和现蕾前、现蕾时、开花时三次追肥；两补是苗期较弱的棉苗补两次追肥。三次追肥对棉花丰产的关系很重大，希望各地努力作到。至于去赘芽、整枝打杈等技术措施，也须作得及时。此外各地还应注意在雨季来临以前做好棉田的排涝设施。
    发言人最后说：今年棉花种得好，苗期管理一般也好，只要我们努力及时贯彻棉田的中后期管理措施，一定能够丰收，也一定能够创造惊人的高产纪录。
