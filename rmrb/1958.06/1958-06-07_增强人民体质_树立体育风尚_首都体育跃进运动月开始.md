    增强人民体质　树立体育风尚
    首都体育跃进运动月开始
    新华社6日讯　一个以增强人民体质、树立体育风尚为目的的“全民体育运动跃进月”，今天在首都开始。许多机关、学校、街道居民的院落和运动场上，今天已开始出现活跃的景象。中国科学院历史研究所一、二所的院子里，到处是作早操、跳绳和练单双杠的人；北京大学各系的许多党、团负责人带头参加体育锻炼，学生们几乎百分之百地参加了早操，下午召开全校动员大会后有些教授还组织了太极拳学习小组；有些地区的居民今天第一次作了体操。在这个“跃进月”里，将通过宣传教育，开展多种多样的体育活动，使每人每天都能根据本人的具体情况，参加十分钟以上的体育锻炼。体育工作基础较好的单位，将广泛组织单项运动竞赛和测验，使更多的人达到劳卫制和等级运动员标准。
    在“跃进月”内，全市各公共体育场所每晚将有全国的、市级的、区级的、基层的等各级优秀运动队举行表演和比赛，每个星期天从早到晚都有各种项目的竞赛活动。各区也将组织体育教师和学生，利用假日和休息时间，分片到各基层单位辅导群众进行体育活动。
    中共北京市委书记处书记、北京市副市长张友渔今晨发表广播讲话。他说，体育不仅关系着个人的健康，也关系着全国社会主义建设事业。在当前全国生产大跃进高潮里，人人比干劲，比多快好省地完成各项任务，这就不仅要求每个人具有共产主义的风格、熟练的技术、丰富的知识，也必须有坚强的体质。他号召全市人民自觉地经常参加体育锻炼，使之成为风气。
