    Worth Writing About Extensively
    The People's Daily published an inspiring article on May 26th, written by Comrade Li Xingfa, the director of the Refractory Material Factory in Changxing County, Zhejiang, titled "Opened the Door to the Mystery of Technology." This is truly an exciting and good article. Their spirit of hard struggle, their heroic spirit of "what foreigners can do, we can also do; what foreigners cannot do, we can also do," proves that we can catch up with and surpass Britain in less than fifteen years. Their deeds are worth writing about extensively. I suggest that similar deeds across the country be written into books, plays, and made into movies for widespread dissemination, so that those with insufficient revolutionary vigor will wake up and muster their energy.

    值得大书特书
    5月26日人民日报刊登了浙江长兴县耐火器材厂厂长李兴发同志写的“打开了技术神秘之门”。这真是一篇激动人心的好文章。他们那种艰苦奋斗的精神，那种“外国人能做到的，我们也能做到；外国人不能做到的，我们也能做到”的英雄气概，证明了我们不用十五年就可赶上和超过英国。他们的事迹值得大书特书。我建议把全国类似这样的事迹写成书、剧本，摄制成电影，广为传播，使那些革命干劲不足的人看了，猛醒过来，鼓起干劲。
