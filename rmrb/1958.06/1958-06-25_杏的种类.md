    Apricots are one of the many fruit trees native to China. The book *Guanzi* (around 685 BC) contains a record of "five fertile soils suitable for apricots," summarizing that apricot trees can be planted in different soils, indicating that apricot cultivation was already quite common in China as far back as two and a half thousand years ago. Du Mu's famous poem, "Excuse me, where can I find a tavern? A shepherd points to Apricot Blossom Village in the distance," further suggests that there were large-scale apricot cultivation villages at that time.

    Apricot tree cultivation requires relatively little labor because it does not have high requirements for soil conditions. Therefore, in northern China, apricot trees can be found in plains, sandy wastelands, hills, or high mountains. However, apricot trees prefer a dry climate, so Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Henan provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region all abound in apricots or apricot kernels. Although apricot trees are also cultivated in areas south of the Huai River, the high temperatures and rainfall in the south often cause the growing fruits to fall off, and the ripe fruits are prone to rot. The quality of the remaining fruits is also poor. Therefore, the distribution of apricot trees decreases further south.

    In foreign countries, apricot cultivation is mostly for fresh fruit or processing. In China, apricots are divided into three categories: kernel-use apricots, flesh-use apricots, and dual-purpose apricots.

    Kernel-use apricots have very thin, fibrous flesh that is not suitable for eating. However, the apricot kernels are large, full, and nutritious, with some containing more than 25% protein and more than 47% oil. These apricots have been exported in large quantities in the past and present, and their economic value is very high. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual export value reached over one million taels of silver, ranking second among various dried and fresh fruit exports (walnut kernels were first). The cultivation requirements for this type of apricot are also low, generally only requiring planting on mountains or even barren hills. Famous varieties include "Bai Yu Bian" and "Long Wang Mao" (produced in Hebei), and "Ke Lala" (produced in Shaanxi).

    Flesh-use apricots are more widely distributed than kernel-use apricots. In addition to being used as fresh fruit, they can also be processed into canned fruit in syrup or jam, and dried apricots. This type of apricot has a very rich variety in China, such as "Sha Jin Hong" from Qingxu, Shanxi, "Cao Xing" from Sanyuan, Shaanxi, "Yin Xing" and "Mai Huang Xing" from Changli, Hebei, and "Xiang Bai Xing" from Beijing, all of which are of excellent quality. Other varieties, such as "Jin Gang Quan," "Da Pian Tou," "Guan Lao Ye Lian," and "Da Jie Xing," have very large fruits, with most weighing over eighty grams. Among them, the larger "Da Pian Tou" (produced in Lanzhou) fruits can weigh over one hundred and thirty grams. It is said that such large apricots cannot be found abroad.

    Dual-purpose apricots are varieties that can be used for both flesh and kernels. The better ones include "Shui Bian" and "Yi Chuan Ling" from Miyun and other places in Hebei Province, and "Zhu Bao Zi" and "Ye Sheng Zi" from Huaxian, Shaanxi. These apricots are mostly cultivated in mountainous areas. Their kernels are sweet kernels, and the flesh can also be dried, but they are inferior to the kernels of excellent kernel-use apricots and the flesh of flesh-use apricots. Therefore, the cultivation of this type of apricot is not very common at present, and further selection and research are needed to improve them.

    In addition, many mountainous areas also have many wild or semi-wild mountain apricots. The flesh of these apricots is not suitable for eating, and the kernels are very bitter, but they can be used to extract oil and can also be used for medicinal purposes (the kernel contains benzaldehyde, which can be used as a cough suppressant, but the kernel contains cyanide and is highly toxic, requiring processing and extraction). Therefore, they also have certain value. After the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture, many areas have grafted mountain apricots into kernel-use apricots.

    杏的种类
    翁心桐
    杏是我国许多原产果树中的一种。管子一书（约在公元前685年）里有五沃之土宜杏的记载，总结出杏树可在不同土壤种植，可知远在两千五百年前的我国，就已经相当普遍的栽培着杏了。在杜牧的名诗“借问酒家何处有，牧童遥指杏花村”的句里，更可以推测到当时已有成村的大面积杏的栽培了。
    杏树的栽培比较省工，因为它对土壤条件的要求不高，所以在我国北部，不论平原、沙荒、丘陵或高山，都有杏的踪迹。但是杏树喜欢干燥的气候，所以河北、山西、陕西、甘肃、山东、河南等省和新疆维吾尔自治区，都盛产杏或杏仁。淮河以南地方，虽然也有杏树的栽培，但是南方地区高温多雨，正在生长的果实往往就落掉了，成熟了的果实又容易腐烂，存下的果实品质也较差，所以，愈往南杏树的分布就愈少。
    国外栽培杏多作鲜果或加工用，我国是分为仁用杏、肉用杏、兼用杏三类。
    仁用杏的果肉很薄，多纤维，不堪食用。但是杏仁大而饱满，营养丰富，有的含蛋白质达25％以上，含油量达47％以上。这种杏在过去和现在都有大量出口，经济价值很高。抗日战争前每年出口值达银百万两以上，占各种干鲜果出口的第二位（核桃仁为第一位）。这种杏的栽培条件也很低，一般只在山地甚至荒山上种植就行了。著名的品种有“白玉扁”、“龙王帽”（河北产）、“壳拉拉”（陕西产）等。
    肉用杏的分布比仁用杏更广，除了作鲜果用外，还可以加工制作糖水或果酱罐头和杏脯等。这种杏在我国的品种十分丰富，如山西清徐的“沙金红”，陕西三原的“曹杏”，河北昌黎的“银杏”和“麦黄杏”，北京的“香白杏”等，品质都很优良。又如“金钢拳”、“大偏头”、“关老爷脸”、“大节杏”等品种，果实很大，重量多在八十公分以上。其中“大偏头”（兰州产）中大的果实，有重达一百三十公分以上的。这样大的杏子，据说在国外是找不到的。
    兼用杏是果肉和杏仁两用的品种，比较好的有河北省密云等地的“水扁”、“一串铃”，陕西华县的“珠宝子”、“野生子”等。这种杏多在山地栽培。它的杏仁是甜仁，果肉也可以晒干，但是比起优良的仁用杏的仁和肉用杏的肉来，都差一等。所以这种杏的栽培目前并不很多，需要进一步选择和研究提高。
    此外，许多山区还有不少野生或半野生的山杏。它的果肉不堪食用，它的仁很苦，却可以榨油，还可当药用（仁内含苯甲醛，可作镇咳剂，但仁内含?化物有剧毒，需加工提取），所以亦有一定价值。农业大跃进后，许多地区已将山杏改接成为仁用杏了。
