　　Let Industry and Agriculture Speed Along the General Line
    Hubei Establishes a Nearly 1,000-Person Inspection Team to Promote Industrial Development by the Entire Party and All the People
    Yunnan Industry and Agriculture Inspection Team Sets Off to Inspect, Promote, Help, and Find Treasures
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st – The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), seriously implementing the general line of socialist construction, has formed an industrial work inspection team of nearly 1,000 people, and will go to various places in seven routes starting from June 1st for inspection.

    The purpose of this inspection is to take the general line as the standard, to promote industrial development by the entire party and all the people, to promote urban support for rural areas, and to promote the complete victory of the rectification campaign, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution. For prefectures and counties, the focus of inspection is on: the county's local industrial plan and measures; the leadership of the prefectural and county party committees over industry; the development of small and medium-sized industries; the rectification movement of local industrial and transportation enterprises, eliminating blind spots and strengthening weak links. For cities, the focus of inspection is on: the work of urban support for rural areas, especially the work of urban industry and commerce in supporting local industries and agricultural machinery and equipment and raw materials; the enterprise rectification movement; and the development of the technical revolution and cultural revolution.

    This inspection will focus on "dismounting to see the flowers," combined with "riding on horseback to see the flowers," in order to achieve a combination of depth and breadth in the inspection. For new experiences that emerge in various places, the inspection team will promptly organize on-site meetings to promote them on the spot. For experiences that need to be promoted throughout the province, they will be introduced through newspapers and magazines and by organizing professional on-site meetings.

    The Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to this inspection. Six days before the inspection team set off, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial urban and industrial work conference, studied the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and made a communication report, starting from breaking down superstitions and liberating the mind, and studied the industrial situation in the province. Participating in this inspection are six secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, five standing committee members, and thirty-one members. They also organized more than 200 geological, steel, hydropower, machinery, coal, and chemical professional and technical personnel to participate, to help various places solve various technical problems.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 1st – The twelve industry and agriculture inspection teams organized by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CCP, set off on May 31st to various parts of the province to inspect industrial and agricultural production in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CCP, and at the same time to widely communicate and publicize the general line of socialist construction in various places.

    Each inspection team is led by the heads of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CCP, the Provincial People's Committee, the Trade Union, the Communist Youth League, and enterprise leading organs. Before departure, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CCP convened a meeting of the heads and deputy heads of the various inspection teams to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. Ma Jikong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CCP and General Leader of the various industry and agriculture inspection teams, pointed out at the meeting that the tasks of the inspection team are: first, to conduct inspections in accordance with the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results"; second, to promote; third, to help; and fourth, to find treasures. The content of the inspection: in agriculture, mainly the planting plans for the six major crops of rice, corn, potatoes, sugarcane, cotton, and flue-cured tobacco, the technical revolution, and the fight against drought; in industry, mainly the policy of local industry, the speed of execution of plans, etc. The method of inspection is to grasp both ends and bring along the middle, to find the advanced and establish the advanced.

    At the same time, the movement to publicize the general line throughout Yunnan Province has also begun. On the 30th, Zheng Gang, the representative attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, made a report to the party member cadres of the province and Kunming city-level organs on the communication of the Party's general line of socialism. The Yunnan People's Publishing House is reprinting 700,000 copies of documents related to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and began distributing them to various places on the 31st. Kunming City is organizing a vast propaganda team, including reporters, art troupes, rural and factory clubs, etc., to widely publicize the general line of socialist construction to the city's people. Cadres of all ethnic groups in the ethnic minority areas of the Yunnan border are also vying to buy and read newspapers containing conference documents, forming a wave of learning.

　　让工农业沿着总路线飞驰
    湖北组成近千人的检查团促进全党全民办工业
    云南工农业检查团出发检查、促进、帮助、找宝
    新华社武汉1日电  中共湖北省委认真贯彻社会主义建设总路线，组成近千人的工业工作检查团，从6月1日起分七路赴各地检查。
    这次检查，是以总路线为标准，以促进全党、全民办工业，促进城市支援农村，促进整风全胜和技术革命、文化革命的开展为目的。对专、县着重检查：县的地方工业规划和措施；地委、县委对工业的领导；中小型工业的发展；地方工业与交通运输企业的整风运动，消灭空白点和加强薄弱环节。对城市着重检查：城市支援农村的工作，特别是城市工商业支援地方工业和农业机械设备和原材料的工作；企业的整风运动；技术革命和文化革命开展的情况。
    这次检查，是以下马看花为主，结合走马看花，以求检查做到深和广结合。对各地出现的新经验，检查团将及时就地组织现场会议推广。对需要在全省推广的经验，则通过报纸书刊介绍和组织专业现场会议推广。
    省委对这次检查非常重视。在检查团出发前六天，省委就召开了全省城市和工业工作会议，学习了“八大”二次会议的文件和作了传达报告，从破除迷信、解放思想入手，研究了全省工业情况。参加这次检查的，有省委书记六人、常务委员五人和委员三十一人。他们另外还组织了地质、钢铁、水电、机械、煤炭和化工等专业技术人员二百多人参加，以帮助各地解决各种技术问题。
    新华社昆明1日电  中共云南省委组织的十二个工农业检查团，5月31日分路出发前往全省各地，根据中共八大二次会议的精神检查工农业生产，同时在各地广泛传达和宣传社会主义建设总路线。
    各个检查团分别由中共云南省委、省人民委员会、工会、共青团和企业领导机关的负责人率领。临出发前，中共云南省委召开了各个检查团的团长、副团长会议，传达了“八大”二次会议的精神。中共云南省委书记处书记、各工农业检查团总团长马继孔在会上指出，检查团的任务一是根据“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”这条总路线进行检查，二是促进，三是帮助，四是找宝。检查的内容：在农业方面，主要是水稻、包谷、薯类、甘蔗、棉花、烤烟等六大作物的种植计划，技术革命和抗旱斗争；在工业方面，主要是地方工业的方针，执行计划的速度等。检查的方法是抓两头、带中间，找先进、树立先进。
    与此同时，云南全省宣传总路线的运动也已经开始。30日，出席“八大”二次会议的代表郑刚，向省和昆明市级机关的党员干部作了关于党的社会主义总路线的传达。云南人民出版社正翻印七十万本有关“八大”二次会议的文件，并于31日开始分发各地。昆明市正组织一支包括报告员、文艺团体、农村和工厂俱乐部等人员组成的阵容浩大的宣传队伍，向全市人民广泛宣传社会主义建设总路线。云南边疆少数民族地区各族干部，也争相购买和阅读登有会议文件的报纸，形成了学习的热潮。
