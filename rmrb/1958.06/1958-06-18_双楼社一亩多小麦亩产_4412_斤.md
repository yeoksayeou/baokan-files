Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th: The Shuanglou Agricultural Cooperative in Shangqiu County, eastern Henan Province, has achieved a new high in wheat yield. A 1.2957 mu experimental plot yielded a total of 5717 jin of wheat, creating a high-yield record of 4412 jin, four taels, and five qian per mu, exceeding the high yield of the Xingguang Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei.

	Last autumn, the sorghum planted on this land was flooded. Later, no crops were planted, and it became a sun-cured fallow land. Last autumn, it was plowed six inches deep with a double-shared plow, and at the end of August, it was deep-plowed one chi and five cun with a grab hook. On September 10th, it was plowed five cun again with a soil plow, and it was harrowed twenty-two times in total. It was originally planned to plant vegetables, but later wheat was planted using the Bima No. 1 improved variety. It was densely planted with a row spacing of 3.3 cun, with an average of 32 jin of seeds per mu, twice as much as usual. The seeds were not only soaked in warm water but also mixed with 20 jin of ammonium sulfate.

	This plot of land was fertilized twice as a base fertilizer and five times as a top dressing. In addition to several rains, it was also watered for root development, greening, and jointing. According to the calculation of several plants before harvesting, there were an average of 1,639,600 plants per mu. The large ears had more than 100 grains, with an average of more than 39 grains per ear. It was threshed four times.

	This plot of land is an experimental field planted by Yang Shenglun (Communist Party member) of the Zhao Village Production Team of the Shuanglou Commune, and Yang Guangju, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. Liu Xueqin, secretary of the Shangqiu County Party Committee, Li Fanshu, the county magistrate, Meng Jilun, the head of the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee, and other responsible comrades went to the Shuanglou Commune to congratulate them. At the same time, they also measured the land and calculated the yield together with Wu Shusen, the secretary of the Township Party Committee of this township.

    双楼社一亩多小麦亩产4412斤
    据新华社郑州17日电　河南省东部商丘县双楼农业社小麦丰产纪录更上一层楼。一点二九五七亩试验田，共收小麦五千七百一十七斤，创造了亩产小麦四千四百一十二斤四两五钱多的丰产纪录，超过了湖北谷城县星光社的高额产量。
    这块地去年秋季种的高粱被水淹了，后来没有种什么庄稼，成了晒垡地。去秋用双铧犁犁了六寸深，8月底又用抓钩深翻一尺五，9月10日又用土犁翻了五寸，前后共耙了二十二遍。本来准备种菜，后来种上了小麦，用碧玛一号良种，三点三寸行距耧密植，平均每亩下三十二斤种子，比一般地增加一倍。种子不仅浸过温汤，还拌了二十斤硫酸铵。
    这块地共上了两次底肥，五次追肥。除下了几场雨外，还浇了盘根水、返青水、拔节水。收割前根据数棵推算，每亩平均有一百六十三万九千六百多棵。大穗有一百多粒，平均每穗三十九粒多。共打了四场。
    这块地是双楼社赵庄生产队杨圣伦（共产党员）、共青团支部书记杨广居等人种的试验田。中共商丘县委书记刘学勤、县长李繁庶、县委农村工作部长孟记伦等负责同志，都到双楼社祝贺，同时还和这个乡的中共党委书记吴树森一起丈量土地，核算产量。
