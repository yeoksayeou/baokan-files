Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 18th: The example of workers at the Qiu Xin Shipyard studying philosophy has greatly encouraged Shanghai workers. They have broken the superstition that workers with low education cannot learn theory. Many factory enterprises have established theory study groups, and a mass theoretical study upsurge is taking shape.

	Emphasizing the present over the past, and integrating theory with practice are the most prominent characteristics of Shanghai workers' study of philosophy, and also the most important experience of the first worker theory study group in Shanghai—the philosophy group of the Qiu Xin Shipyard's repair workshop. Now, all worker philosophy groups in the city are learning from the Qiu Xin Shipyard's approach, taking Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and the Party's policies and resolutions as the central content of their study. At the current stage, the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China are the main study materials. While carefully understanding the basic spirit of the documents, they analyze and study problems in their own factory, workshop, and work thinking, and then raise them to a theoretical level for resolution. This learning method is welcomed by the workers. Learning theory from practical experience has quickly improved workers' ideological understanding and ability to analyze problems. Some workers in the cigarette rolling section of the Da Dong Tobacco Factory, after studying philosophy, gave play to their subjective initiative, analyzed the decline in cigarette quality that occurred in the comprehensive realization of the Great Leap Forward plan, and pointed out that they had emphasized objective difficulties without making enough subjective efforts. After discussion, they believed that they should mainly cooperate with the previous process to solve the problem of declining cigarette quality. After they discussed why the issue of the technological revolution and the working class's tasks in the technological revolution is being raised now, their daring to think and act became even greater.

	The bold creativity of the working masses in theoretical study has greatly inspired theoretical workers. The Shanghai Philosophical Society listened to the introduction of workers studying philosophy at the Qiu Xin Shipyard and also held a symposium. Philosophers unanimously agreed that theoretical work needs to be liberated from the small circle of a few people sitting in their studies researching book knowledge. Theoretical workers should go into practical work, go to the masses, learn from the working people, and at the same time propagate Marxist-Leninist theory to them.

	Now, some theory teachers from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's primary party school and district party committees have begun to go deep into factories to help workers establish philosophy groups and study theoretical problems together with them in group meetings. Teachers from the Philosophy Department of Fudan University are also contacting factories and will soon participate in the work of popularizing philosophy among the working masses.

    上海许多工人纷纷成立学习小组
    从实际出发学习哲学
    据新华社上海18日电　求新造船厂工人学哲学的榜样，使上海工人得到很大鼓舞，他们破除了认为工人文化低不能学理论的迷信，许多工厂企业的工人纷纷成立理论学习小组，一个群众性的理论学习高潮正在形成。
    厚今薄古、理论联系实际，是上海工人学习哲学的最大特点，也是上海第一个工人理论学习小组——求新造船厂修造车间哲学小组最主要的经验。现在全市各个工人哲学小组都学习求新造船厂的作法，以毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”和党的政策、决议作为学习的中心内容，在目前阶段又以中共八大二次会议文件作为主要学习材料。在认真领会文件的基本精神的情况下，联系本厂本车间和自己工作思想上的问题进行分析研究，再提高到理论上加以解决。这种学习方法受到工人们的欢迎。从实际出发学习理论，很快地提高了工人的思想认识和分析问题的能力。大东烟厂卷烟工段的一些工人，在学习哲学后发挥主观能动性，分析了在全面实现跃进计划中发生的卷烟质量下降问题，指出强调客观困难没有尽到主观上的努力。经过讨论，他们认为应当主要和上一工序协作，解决卷烟质量下降问题。他们讨论了为什么现在提出技术革命和工人阶级在技术革命中的任务问题以后，敢想敢作的劲头更大了。
    工人群众在学习理论上的大胆创造性，给理论工作者以很大的启发。上海哲学学会听取了求新造船厂工人学哲学的介绍，还举行了座谈。哲学家们一致认为理论工作需要从少数人坐在书斋里研究书本知识的小圈子里解放出来，理论工作者要到实际工作中去，到群众中去，向劳动人民学习，同时向他们宣传马列主义的理论。
    现在中共上海市委初级党校和区委的一些理论教师，已经开始深入工厂，帮助工人建立哲学小组，和他们一道在小组会上研究理论问题，复旦大学哲学系的教师们也在和工厂联系，即将参加在工人群众中普及哲学的工作。
