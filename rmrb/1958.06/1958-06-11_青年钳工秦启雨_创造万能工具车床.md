    Young Fitter Qin Qiyu
    Creates Universal Tool Lathe
    Qin Qiyu, a twenty-year-old grade-three fitter with a junior high school education from the Northwest Automobile and Machine Tool Repair Factory, invented a universal tool lathe with the strong support of the Party Committee Secretary and Factory Director, and the help of his comrades. This lathe can perform seven processes: milling, turning, drilling, grinding, slotting, planing, and punching. It can also perform vertical milling and horizontal milling. The lathe has a simple structure, with only sixty-odd parts. It is easy and flexible to use, easy and convenient to move, and can be driven by a two-horsepower engine. It is suitable for both large and small jobs, and can be easily modified for automatic feeding, automatic cutting, and thread cutting (turning screws).

    青年钳工秦启雨
    创造万能工具车床
    西北汽车机具修配厂一个年仅二十岁具有初中文化程度的三级钳工秦启雨，在党委书记、厂长大力支持和同志们的帮助下，发明了一种万能工具车床。这部车床可作铣、车、钻、磨、锸、刨、冲七个工序的活，还可立铣、卧铣。车床构造简单，只有六十多种零件，使用轻便灵活，搬动容易、方便，用二马力的发动机就可带动。用它干大小活都很适用，如稍加改装还可自动走刀、自动吃刀和挑扣（车螺丝）。
