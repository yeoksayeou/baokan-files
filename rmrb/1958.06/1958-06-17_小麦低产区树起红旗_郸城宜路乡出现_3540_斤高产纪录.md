Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th. In Dancheng County, eastern Henan, a sandy area that has always had low grain yields, a red flag of 3,540 jin per mu of wheat has been raised this year. This high-yield record was created by Wang Shugui, the second secretary of the Yilu Township Party Committee in Dancheng County, and Yang Shupeng, the captain of the first production team of the Yangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, in a 2.1 mu wheat experimental field. Township Party Secretary Zhang Xuegong and others personally supervised the harvesting and threshing. The Organization Minister of the Dancheng County Party Committee went to investigate and measure the land, proving it to be completely accurate. This 2.1 mu of land was an old vegetable garden, and last year's wheat yield was 650 jin per mu. This season, before sowing the wheat, the land was plowed three times with a deep plowing of one and a half chi, harrowed eight times, with a base fertilizer application of 30,000 jin per mu, four topdressings of coarse fertilizer, each time 10,000 jin per mu, and three additional topdressings of urea fertilizer, each time 1,000 jin per mu. Additionally, 90 jin of sesame cake was applied once per mu, and finally, 50 jin of wood ash was applied once per mu. The selected variety was the local farmer's improved variety "Purple Stem Coarse." During wheat field management, in addition to applying topdressing fertilizer in stages, root-watering, greening water, and jointing water were successively applied, and the wheat was continuously treated with pesticides three times to prevent wheat midges, eliminating the pests.

In addition, the Duanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in this township also has 10.03 mu of wheat with a yield of over 3,000 jin per mu. Among them, 5.5 mu of wheat in the second production team averaged 3,150 jin per mu; and 4.8 mu of wheat in the first production team averaged 3,274.5 jin per mu.

    小麦低产区树起红旗
    郸城宜路乡出现3540斤高产纪录
    新华社郑州15日电　一向粮食产量较低的豫东沙区郸城县，今年也升起了小麦亩产三千五百四十斤的红旗。这个高额丰产纪录是郸城县宜路乡党委第二书记王树贵和杨庄农业社第一生产队队长杨树朋等在二亩一分小麦试验田里创造出来的。乡党委书记张学功等亲自监收监打，又经过中共郸城县委组织部长前往调查，丈量土地，证明完全确实，这二亩一分地是老菜园地，去年小麦亩产达六百五十斤。这季小麦在播种以前套犁三遍，深耕一尺半，耙八遍，每亩施底肥三万斤，追粗肥四遍，每次每亩一万斤，另外还追尿肥三次，每次每亩一千斤，还追麻饼一次，每亩九十斤，最后又施了一次草木灰，每亩五十斤。选用的品种是当地农家良种“紫秆糙”。在麦田管理过程中，除分期施追肥外，还先后浇了盘根水、返青水、拔节水，并用药剂连续防治吸浆虫三遍，消灭了虫害。
    另外这个乡的段庄农业社也有十亩零三分小麦亩产在三千斤以上。其中有第二生产队的五亩五分小麦，平均亩产三千一百五十斤；第一生产队的四亩八分小麦，平均亩产三千二百七十四斤半。
