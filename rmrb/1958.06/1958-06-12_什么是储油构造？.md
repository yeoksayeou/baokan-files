What is an Oil-Bearing Structure?
	Shí Gōng
    Gasoline spilled on the ground disappears in a short time. Where did it go? It turned into a gas and ran into the air. If you put it in a bottle and forget to put the cap on, it will all run away after a few days. Gasoline is extracted from petroleum, and many substances in petroleum have the same "escape" character as gasoline. Therefore, oil fields are not like other mineral deposits, which stay where they are after they are formed. There must be a place like a tightly capped bottle to preserve them and become an oil field.

    Where can you find such a big bottle underground?

    Bottles are easy to find; many porous rocks are good places to store oil. Don't be fooled by how solid the rock looks; there are plenty of pores inside. However, some are smaller and fewer, or the pores are not connected to each other, so water cannot penetrate, and we call it impermeable rock, such as clay and shale; other rocks, such as sandstone, have many large pores that allow water to pass through, called permeable rock. In this kind of permeable rock, oil can be stored in its pores.

    Having permeable rock alone is not enough. If there isn't a layer of impermeable rock on top, like a bottle without a cap, the oil will run away; if there isn't a layer of impermeable rock underneath, like a bottle without a bottom, it will also run away; it must be tightly sealed with impermeable rock layers above and below.

    It's not enough to have impermeable rock layers sandwiched in. When have we ever seen a lot of water gathering when it's spilled on a table? No matter how much water there is, it will spread in all directions. Only when there is a depression in the center of the table will a lot of water gather there. The situation is exactly the opposite now; only where there is a bulge, like a saddle, will more oil gather at the top of that saddle.

    What is the reason for this? It turns out that water is also hidden in the oil-bearing rock. Oil is lighter than water and floats upwards, so oil naturally rushes to the top and gathers into a deposit. Incidentally, natural gas is also often found with oil. Gas is lighter than oil, so it gathers in the highest place. Often natural gas is discovered first, followed by oil. The discovery process of some oil fields in Sichuan is like this.

    This kind of place suitable for storing oil is called an oil-bearing structure.

    Finding an oil-bearing structure gives some hope of discovering oil. The three new oil wells in Sichuan were all drilled on oil-bearing structures.

    It is not very easy to recognize an oil-bearing structure in the field, because the part of the structure exposed on the surface is usually damaged. What we see may be paddy fields, hills, messy rocks, and a structure often spans tens or hundreds of miles. What we see here or there is only a local phenomenon, so how can we see it at a glance? At this time, we only need to measure the direction of inclination of the rock layers exposed on the surface in various places and the angle they form with the ground plane. If the same layer of rock inclines eastward in a certain place in the east and westward in a certain place in the west, then there should be a saddle peak between these two places. As for whether the rocks in the east and west are the same layer, we can identify them from their color, thickness, composition, and whether the fossils of ancient organisms they contain are the same. When we saw the photos of the Longnüsi drilling well in Sichuan, the drilling well was surrounded by paddy fields. How did we know that there was oil here? In fact, as long as you understand the above principles, you won't find it strange. Of course, it takes a lot of work to really find an oil-bearing structure, especially to find the peak hidden underground. Often, in addition to direct observation on the ground, some other scientific technologies are needed to assist.

    Finally, oil is not only stored in the oil-bearing structures mentioned above, but it is most reliable to find it in this kind of structure, so it is usually the first place to look for oil.

    什么是储油构造？
    石工
    汽油泼在地上，一会儿就消失了，到哪里去了呢？变成气体跑到空中去了；要是把它装到瓶子里，忘记了盖瓶塞，过了些天也会全都跑掉。汽油是从石油中取得的，石油中的许多物质都有和汽油一样会逃跑的性格。因此，石油矿不像别的矿产，生成以后就呆在那儿不动，得要有那种像盖严了的瓶子似的地方，才能把它保存下来，成为油田。
    在地下，哪儿去找这么大的瓶子呢？
    瓶子好找，许多具有孔隙的石头就是藏石油的好地方。别看石头那样结实，里面的孔隙可有的是。不过有的比较小、比较少，或者孔与孔之间不连通，因此水浸不透，我们叫它不透水的石头，像粘土、页岩就是；另外一些石头譬如砂岩，孔隙多而大，能够透水，叫透水的石头。在这种透水的石头里，石油便可以藏在它的孔隙中。
    单有透水的石头还不成，要是上面没有一层不透水的石头，好像瓶子没有盖，石油会跑掉；下面没有一层不透水的石头，好像瓶子没有底，也会跑掉；必须上下都有不透水的石头封得严严的。
    有不透水的岩层夹住了，这还不够，我们几时见过泼在桌子上的水聚集得很多呢？水再多也会向四面流散，只有当桌子中央凹下一块，那里的水才会聚多。现在的事情恰恰相反，只有什么地方凸起一块，像马鞍一样，在那鞍子的顶部，聚集的石油才多。
    这是什么道理呢？原来在含油的石头里，也藏得有水。油比水轻，向上浮，石油自然就奔向顶部，聚集成矿。附带要说一下，天然气也常和石油藏在一起，气比油又轻，因此它聚集在最顶端的地方。常常先发现了天然气接着就发现了石油，四川有些油田的发现过程就是这样。
    这种适宜储藏石油的地方，叫作储油构造。
    找寻到储油构造，发现石油就有了几分希望了，四川新喷油的三口井都是在储油构造上钻的。
    在野外，要认出储油构造，并不是很简单的。因为这个构造露出地面的部分通常受到破坏，我们看见的可能是水田、山丘，乱七八糟的石头，而且一个构造往往拉开有几十里、几百里，我们在这里或那里看见的不过是局部的现象，哪能一目了然。这时只有把各处露出地面的岩层倾斜的方向和它与地平面所成角度都量出来，要是同一层石头在东边某处向东倾斜，在西边某处向西倾斜，那末在这两处之间，应该有个马鞍的顶峰。至于这东西两处的石头是不是同一层，我们可以从它的颜色、粗细、成分种种性质和它所保存的古代生物的化石是否相同来识别。我们看见四川龙女寺钻井的照片时，钻井的附近是水田，怎么会知道这里有石油的呢？其实只要懂得上述道理，就不觉得奇怪了。当然，要真的找起储油构造来，特别是要找到那个藏在地下的顶峰，是需要花很多劳动的，往往除开直接在地面观察以外，还要用一些别的科学技术来协助。
    最后，石油并不是只藏在上面所说这种储油构造里，但在这种构造里找起来最有把握，因此通常是先在这种构造里找石油。
