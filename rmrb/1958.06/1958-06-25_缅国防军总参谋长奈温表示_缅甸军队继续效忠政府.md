Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 24th: Myanmar Defense Forces Chief of Staff General Ne Win said on the 23rd that the Defense Forces must continue to be loyal to the ruling government in order to respect democracy and the will of the people.

Ne Win made these remarks while speaking at the annual commanders' meeting. He said that the Defense Forces must never serve a certain individual, a certain group, or a certain party, but must serve the country and the people.

Ne Win said that the people of Myanmar are eager to know whether the army is standing on one side in the current political struggle due to its previous loyalty and opinions. He pointed out that although everyone has their own opinions and special tendencies, as soldiers, everyone must be equally loyal to the constitution and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 24th: At a meeting held on the 22nd, 140 members of the Supreme Council of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League's U Ba Swe-U Kyaw Nyein faction passed a resolution to expel U Nu, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, and Vice-Chairman Thakin Tin, as well as eight others, from the League's Executive Committee, and at the meeting on the 23rd, U Ba Swe was elected as the chairman of their League.

U Ba Swe then appointed U Kyaw Nyein as Vice-Chairman and Thakin Da Kin as Secretary-General. The meeting also produced a central executive committee of the league consisting of sixteen people. Prior to this, 136 members of the Supreme Council of the U Ba Swe-U Kyaw Nyein faction had announced on the 15th the dissolution of the Central Executive Committee of the League.

    据新华社仰光24日电　缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军在23日说，国防军为了尊重民主和人民的意志，必须继续效忠于执政的政府。
    奈温是在一年一度的指挥官会议上发表讲话时这样说的。他说，国防军绝不能为某个个人、某个集团或者某个党派服务，而必须为国家和人民服务。
    奈温说，缅甸人民渴望知道军队是否由于以前的忠诚和意见而在目前的政治斗争中站在某一方面。他指出，虽然每个人会有自己的意见和特殊倾向，但是作为军人来说，大家都必须同样效忠于宪法和民主。
