    People's Warriors Sweat Across Tianshan North and South
    Production and Construction Corps Makes Great Contributions
    Xinjiang's Various Ethnic Groups Use Fish and Water, Blood and Flesh to Describe Friendship with the People's Liberation Army
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the People's Liberation Army has become a strong force in the socialist construction of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and has continuously made outstanding contributions in supporting various productions in the autonomous region.
    In recent years, the people's warriors, with heroic selfless labor, have vigorously developed the agricultural and pastoral industries of the troops, processing side businesses, transportation, and basic construction. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, they immediately threw themselves into the production front. They started from scratch, from small to large, turning more than 3 million mu of wilderness into oases, establishing forty-four modern mechanized large farms and sixteen ranches. The cumulative grain production over the years was 1,198.8 million jin, and cotton (seed cotton) was 212.6 million jin. The troops' animal husbandry has also developed to more than 810,000 heads. They built 114 tractor repair plants, power plants, coal mines, oil, grain and cotton processing plants, and other agricultural and sideline product processing plants on the barren Gobi Desert. On the Tianshan Mountains, which are more than 4,000 meters above sea level, they broke ice and dug mountains to build roads. On the windy and snowy transportation lines and on the hot Gobi Desert, they transport the materials needed for the lives of the various ethnic groups and the various constructions of the autonomous region all year round. By the end of last year, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the troops had accounted for more than 10% of the total output value of the autonomous region. Among them, cotton accounted for 29% of the total output of the autonomous region, the industrial output value accounted for 36.7% of the total industrial output value of the state-owned and local state-owned industries in the autonomous region, and the transportation turnover accounted for more than 40% of the autonomous region.
    Since 1956, the total annual profit of the Xinjiang Military Region Production Troops has been more than 35 million yuan. This year, the troops have put forward plans for a great leap forward in various constructions, reclaiming 3.5 million mu to 4 million mu of wasteland. Build a number of new farms, and strive to create more wealth for the country and enhance the socialist economic strength of the autonomous region. At the same time, all units and industries are required to carry out a campaign to do more good things for the people of all ethnic groups.
    The mechanized farming and advanced agricultural technology of the agricultural production troops have had a profound impact on the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In recent years, the troops have continuously created large-scale high-yield records for wheat, cotton, and corn. These large-scale high-yield fields are generally one to several times higher than those of local farmers, greatly encouraging the confidence of farmers of all ethnic groups to increase production. In particular, the large-scale cotton production in the Manas reclamation area has been fruitful for many years, opening up a new path for the technological reform of cotton planting by farmers of all ethnic groups. Every year, the troops' farms receive hundreds and thousands of farmers of all ethnic groups from far and near to visit and exchange experiences. In 1956, more than 2,000 farmers of all ethnic groups interned in the troops' farms for half a year. From irrigation and plowing to the treatment of various crop seeds and field management, all the advanced agricultural technologies mastered by the people's warriors were taught to the farmers of all ethnic groups.
    In order to support the development of various constructions in the autonomous region, thousands of officers and technical personnel have been transferred to various fronts in the autonomous region. In addition, each reclamation area of the production and construction troops also assigns special personnel to be stationed in agricultural cooperatives near the reclamation area every year to help farmers of all ethnic groups develop production. From 1953 to 1957, the agricultural production troops dispatched more than 2,000 full-time cadres to help 549 agricultural cooperatives of all ethnic groups establish societies and develop production in 25 counties of the autonomous region. More than 200,000 mu of land was cultivated and harvested on behalf of the agricultural cooperatives, and more than 4,800 technicians such as farm tool handlers, plant protection personnel, and water conservancy personnel were trained for the agricultural cooperatives. With the help of the troops, various crops in the agricultural cooperatives have reaped bumper harvests year after year. The general increase in production is between 40% and 60%. Many agricultural cooperatives have therefore been rated as model societies, and the cadres stationed in the societies by the troops have been rated as advanced workers.
    Under the slogan of "not only doing a good job in our own production, but also doing a good job in the production of the masses," the agricultural production troops have given up more than 650,000 mu of reclaimed land to farmers of all ethnic groups in recent years, supporting and adjusting more than 6.3 million jin of fine seeds to farmers of all ethnic groups, and supporting more than 18,000 pieces of various farm tools. Help farmers of all ethnic groups establish households. The agricultural production troops also adjusted land with farmers of all ethnic groups by "exchanging more for less and exchanging good for bad." Before the farmers moved, the troops built beautiful houses for the farmers to live in. In addition, the production troops also helped the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to develop cultural and health undertakings and build hospitals and schools. The doctors of the troops also often treat the people of all ethnic groups.
    Almost all major construction undertakings in the autonomous region have received assistance from the production and construction troops. The sweat of the people's warriors' hard work has been sprinkled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang often use fish and water, blood and flesh to describe the friendship between the People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups. Every year during the Spring Festival, Eid al-Fitr and Corban Festival, the People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups pay respects to each other, sing and dance, and spend happy days together like family members.
    The large number of facts that the People's Liberation Army has supported the people of all ethnic groups has deeply moved the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, and they have compiled these deeds into songs and spread them everywhere. A song praising the deeds of the People's Liberation Army in building water canals for them is circulated in Hetian Ayimailai Village on the southern edge of Tarim. The lyrics say:
    "A hundred years ago, there was a girl here,
    No other woman was more beautiful than her.
    She vowed to marry a hero:
    He can lead the river water to his hometown.
    This girl lived for a hundred years and died guarding this land.
    Now, clear water flows in front of the girl's door,
    As beautiful as the Jinhe and the Milky Way.
    Let our lark also sing this song,
    Fly around to spread the kindness of the People's Liberation Army."

    人民战士的汗珠洒遍天山南北
    生产建设兵团贡献巨大
    新疆各族人民用鱼和水、血和肉形容同解放军的友谊
    本报讯　人民解放军新疆军区生产建设兵团已成为新疆各族人民社会主义建设事业中一支强大的力量，在支援自治区各项生产中，不断地作出了杰出的贡献。
    几年来，人民战士以英雄的忘我劳动，大力发展了部队农牧业，加工副业，交通运输业，和基本建设事业。他们在和平解放新疆以后，立即投入生产战线上去。他们从无到有，从小到大，把三百多万亩荒野变成了绿洲，建立了四十四个现代化机械化大农场和十六个牧场，历年生产的粮食累计为十一亿九千八百多万斤，棉花（籽棉）两亿一千二百六十多万斤，部队的畜牧业也发展到八十一万多头。他们在荒凉的戈壁滩上，兴建了拖拉机修配厂、发电厂、煤矿、油料、粮食和棉花加工厂，以及其他农副产品加工厂一百一十四个。他们在拔海四千多公尺的天山上，破冰凿山、修筑公路，在风雪运输线上，在酷热的戈壁滩上，一年四季不停地运输各族人民生活上和自治区各项建设上所需要的物资。到去年年底，部队工农业总产值已占到自治区总产值的10％以上。其中棉花占自治区总产量29％，工业产值占自治区国营和地方国营工业总产值的36.7％，运输周转量占自治区的40％以上。
    从1956年起，新疆军区生产部队每年利润总额都在三千五百万元以上。今年，部队更提出了各项建设大跃进的计划，开荒造田三百五十万亩到四百万亩。兴建一批新农场，力争为国家创造出更多的财富，增强自治区社会主义经济力量。同时，要求各单位、各行业开展一个多为各族人民做一件好事的运动。
    农业生产部队机械化耕作和先进的农业技术，对于新疆各族农牧民日益起着深刻的影响。部队几年来不断地创造了小麦、棉花、玉米大面积丰产和高额丰产纪录。这些大面积丰产田一般高出当地农民一倍到几倍。大大地鼓舞了各族农民增产的信心。特别是玛纳斯垦区大面积棉花连年丰产，为各族农民植棉技术改革，开辟出了一条崭新的道路。每年，部队农场都接待远近成百上千的各族农民来参观访问，交流经验。1956年，有两千多名各族农民，在部队农场实习了半年之久。从灌溉、犁地到各种作物种籽处理和田间管理，凡人民战士掌握的一切农业先进技术，都教给了各族农民。
    为了支援自治区各项建设事业的发展，曾经有几千名军官和技术力量，转业到自治区各项战线上去。此外，生产建设部队各个垦区，每年还指派专人常驻垦区附近农业社，帮助各族农民发展生产。1953年到1957年，农业生产部队派遣了两千多名专职干部，在自治区二十五个县内，帮助五百四十九个各民族农业社建社和发展生产。为农业社代耕、代收的土地有二十多万亩，为农业社培养的农具手、植保员、水利员等技术人员达四千八百多名。在部队帮助的农业社中，各种农作物连年丰收。一般增产都在40％到60％。不少的农业社因此被评为模范社，部队驻社干部被评为先进工作者。
    农业生产部队在“既要搞好自己的生产，又要搞好群众生产”的口号下，几年来，曾经让出了六十五万多亩开垦的土地给各族农民，支援和调剂给各族农民良种六百三十多万斤。支援各种农具一万八千多件。帮助各族农民建立家务。农业生产部队又“以多换少、以优换劣”和各族农民调剂了土地。在农民搬家以前，部队给农民盖好了一座座漂亮的房屋居住。此外，生产部队还帮助新疆各族人民发展文化和卫生事业，兴修医院和学校。部队的医生也经常为各族人民治病。
    几乎所有自治区重大的建设事业上都曾经得到生产建设部队的援助，人民战士辛勤劳动的汗珠，洒遍天山南北各地。新疆各族人民常用鱼和水、血和肉来形容解放军和各族人民的友谊。每年春节，开斋节和库尔班节，解放军和各族人民，都互相拜节，载歌载舞，亲如家人共同欢度快乐的日子。
    人民解放军支援各族人民的大量事实，深深感动了各族农牧民，他们把这些事迹编了歌儿到处传播。塔里木南缘和阗阿依迈来村留传着这样一首歌儿，歌颂解放军为他们修水渠的事迹。歌词说：
    “百年前这里有一位姑娘，
    没有别的女人比她更漂亮。
    她发下誓言要嫁一位英雄：
    他能把河水引到自己的家乡。
    这姑娘活了一百年，守着死在这块土地上。
    如今，清水从姑娘门前流过，
    美如金河和银河。
    让我们的百灵鸟也唱会这支歌，
    飞到各地去传播解放军的恩德。”
