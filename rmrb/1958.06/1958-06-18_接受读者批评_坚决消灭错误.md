    Accepting Readers' Criticism, Resolutely Eliminating Errors
    On the 11th of this month, the large slogan on the front page of some of our newspapers, "Add Oil! Add Oil! Add Oil for Socialist Construction!" was mistakenly printed as "...Add Oil for Socialist Consctruction!" Many readers called or wrote to offer criticism. We accept the readers' criticism and are determined to eliminate errors. The newspaper's editorial board has already disciplined the personnel responsible for the dereliction of duty, and has decided to launch a campaign to eliminate errors throughout the editorial department.

    接受读者批评  坚决消灭错误
    11日本报有一部分报纸第一版大标语“加油！加油！为社会主义建设加油！”错成“……为社会主义设建加油！”不少读者打电话或写信来提出批评。我们接受读者的批评，决心消灭错误。本报编委会已给予失职人员以处分，并决定在全编辑部开展一个消灭错误的运动。
