Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 14th: Over a thousand people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand gathering at the Friendship Cinema in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building at 7 p.m. this evening, warmly celebrating the 20th anniversary of the founding of the China Welfare Institute.

Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, founder and leader of the China Welfare Institute, Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, Kang Keqing, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defense of Children, Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the China Relief Association, Chen Qiyuan, Director of the Supervisory Committee of the China Relief Association, Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, NPC deputy Liao Mengxing, and leaders of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, including Chen Pixian, Xu Jianguo, and Jin Zhonghua, attended the celebration. The meeting was presided over by Deputy Mayor Jin Zhonghua.

Vice Chairman Song Qingling spoke at the celebration. She said: "Over the past twenty years, we have experienced years of struggle between light and darkness. Nine years ago, light finally triumphed over darkness, and the new China stood brightly like a giant in the East. The original aim of the China Welfare Institute's founding and its struggles: to establish a free, independent country governed by the people, has been realized."

She said: "Our achievements should be directly attributed to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, which has enabled us to continuously leap forward ideologically on the basis of enhanced political awareness! Encouraging us to take action and propelling the entire country to leap forward in all aspects. The welfare of women and children is also leaping forward."

Vice Chairman Song Qingling then said: "As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the China Welfare Institute, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has formulated the general line for our country's socialist construction. We should decide how to do more, faster, better, and more economically in our work. We must eradicate those conservative ideas that limit our work to the existing level and scope. We must do our daily work well, and then gradually and systematically develop the work of our units to a higher technical and scientific level. This is what our society and the current stage of socialist construction require of us. We must demand this of ourselves." Following this, Vice Chairman Song Qingling called on all staff of the China Welfare Institute to cherish past achievements and traditions and to carry out their work creatively in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction.

Vice Chairman Song Qingling said with confidence: "We have the conditions to enable the work of the China Welfare Institute to achieve new development and push the work of the China Welfare Institute to a new climax."

Then Comrade Ke Qingshi spoke, first extending congratulations on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to all the working comrades of the China Welfare Institute.

In his speech, Comrade Ke Qingshi said: "The China Welfare Institute is not a general charitable organization, but a revolutionary organization with a strong fighting will. In the struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the China Welfare Institute always stood with the Chinese people. Its contribution to the Chinese people's liberation movement is worthy of our eternal remembrance."

Comrade Ke Qingshi continued: "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the China Welfare Institute has done a lot of beneficial work and achieved great success in handling maternal and child health care and children's welfare work, and in reporting to the people of all countries about our country's socialist construction. It has also played an active role in strengthening the forces of the people of all countries in defending world peace." He also said: "We believe that the China Welfare Institute, with its glorious tradition, will continue to carry forward the spirit of 'self-reliance and hard struggle', rely more closely on the masses, and serve the masses, and serve socialist construction."

Comrade Ke Qingshi then said that maternal and child health care and children's education are an indispensable part of socialist construction. We should care about the physical and mental health of women and children. We must care about the growth of young people and children, cultivate the communist spirit of children, and make them the working descendants with communist consciousness and healthy physique. Finally, Comrade Ke Qingshi wished the China Welfare Institute greater achievements in our great socialist construction cause.

Comrade Kang Keqing, who came specially from Beijing to participate in the celebration, also spoke at the meeting. She expressed her heartfelt and warm congratulations to all the comrades of the China Welfare Institute on behalf of the comrades from Beijing.

After the meeting, the Children's Art Theater of the China Welfare Institute and the Little Partner Art Troupe of the Children's Palace performed entertainment programs such as the Red Flower Dance, children's solo singing, and the "Good Fortune and Surplus" small song and dance drama. The film "Shanghai's Children" was also shown.

The China Welfare Institute has also received congratulatory gifts, telegrams, and letters from many mass organizations and cultural units. (Attached picture)
