Middle School Students Become Tea Picking Experts

Fang Chenghan, a student in Class 4 of the third grade of the junior high school at She County Middle School in Anhui Province, picked 102 jin and 12 liang of tea leaves single-handedly on May 8th at the tea mountain of the Third Production Team of the Dagu Tea Farmers Cooperative in Daguyun Township, Xitou District, She County. The tea leaves picked by Comrade Fang Chenghan and the tea trees that had been picked were inspected and found to be fully qualified. After this news spread, the male and female members of the entire Daguyun village told each other about it and praised it unanimously.

Wang Baoshi, the First Secretary of the She County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and responsible comrades of the district committee who were inspecting work locally, visited Comrade Fang Chenghan that evening, greatly praised his initiative, and encouraged him to be a model student in combining work and study.

　　中学生成了采茶能手
    安徽歙县中学初中部三年级四班学生方承汉，5月8日在歙县溪头区大谷运乡大谷茶农合作社第三生产队茶山采茶，单手日采茶叶一百零二斤十二两。方承汉同学采下的茶叶和采摘过的茶树，经检查完全合格。这一消息传出后，大谷运全村男女社员都纷纷相告，交口称赞。
    在当地检查工作的中共歙县县委第一书记王保实和区委负责同志当晚访问了方承汉同学，对他的创举大加赞扬，勉励他做一个勤工俭学的模范学生。（杨衡）
