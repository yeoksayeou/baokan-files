	"Selected Cartoons of the Double-Anti Great Leap Forward"
	The works in this collection are mainly selected from the "Shanghai Great Leap Forward Cartoon Exhibition," including sixty works by cartoonists such as Zhang Leping, Zhou Yuequan, Shen Fan, and Cai Zhenhua. Among them, some use serious yet humorous, sharp yet well-intentioned strokes to satirize various forms of bureaucracy, conservatism, and all kinds of wasteful phenomena; at the same time, some use joyful strokes to praise the inspiring deeds emerging from all fronts in the "Double-Anti" movement. This book is edited and published by the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House. (Editor)
