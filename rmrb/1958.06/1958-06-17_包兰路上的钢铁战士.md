    Steel Warriors on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway
    By Liberation Army Daily Reporter Shang Like

    On a clear day, this reporter rode a train on the northern section of the new Baotou-Lanzhou Railway line and arrived at the construction site of the Sandaokan Yellow River Bridge. Here, the heroic railway soldiers overcame the exceptionally severe wind and sandstorms of Inner Mongolia and conquered the natural barrier of the Yellow River, erecting a heroic bridge four and a half months ahead of schedule.

    It is a very meaningful thing to look back on how the railway soldiers lived through the past year.

    Wind and Sand Lose Their Power

    Last spring, when the officers and soldiers of a certain railway engineering unit responsible for this bridge project arrived at the Yellow River after a long journey, there were no houses, no residents, only a desolate desert. Apart from the remains of ancient beacon towers on the east bank of the Yellow River and some stories about the Yang family generals stationing troops and fighting battles here, the area had been uninhabited for centuries; there were only violent wind and sandstorms and the roaring Yellow River.

    From the day the soldiers pitched their tents by the river, strong winds, carrying sand, howled like wolves. Where the wind rose, sand and dust rolled, the sky and earth were dark, and even the gazelles and hares in the desert were frightened, closing their eyes and hiding in the sand pits. The wind and sandstorms blew away the tents, lifted the pot lids, and the freshly cooked rice was filled with sand. In those days, the soldiers had to sleep in the wind, eat in the wind, and sometimes, when they encountered particularly heavy wind and sandstorms, they couldn't even set up their stoves, and they didn't dare put their teeth together when they ate. Sleeping was equally difficult. Because the tents couldn't keep out the wind and sand, the soldiers were often choked awake by the sand in the middle of the night. When they got up, their heads and faces were covered in sand. Some soldiers simply wore goggles and masks to sleep. In such a harsh environment, the soldiers composed many heroic ballads:

    People say the wind and sand in Inner Mongolia are strong,
    But the railway soldiers are not afraid;
    Today we swallow wind and eat sand,
    Tomorrow a rainbow will hang over the grasslands.

    When soldier Chen Zhongyuan was eating, he crunched on a piece of sand. He spat it out and said, "You're trying to break my teeth, but when I finish building the bridge and plant the windbreak forest, I'll subdue you!" Indeed, these heroic builders never succumbed to the wind and sand. In the absence of bricks, tiles, or wood, they miraculously used Yellow River water and riverbank soil to make adobe bricks and build arched barracks in the form of cave dwellings on the beach. They not only had offices and dormitories, but also their own canteens and bathhouses. Some even built parallel bars, pommel horses, and basketball courts. In just a few months, many such new construction villages appeared on this barren land, and people were pleasantly surprised to call them gardens on the Baotou-Lanzhou line.

    Conquering the Natural Barrier of the Yellow River

    Although this railway engineering unit had repaired the Qingchuan River Bridge on the war-torn Korean battlefield and had also repaired old bridges and built countless new ones in various parts of the country, it was the first time they had laid tracks in the desert and built bridges over the Yellow River. If wind and sand were the soldiers' greatest enemy, then the Yellow River's rapids, freezing temperatures, and spring ice floes also brought many troubles to the bridge-building troops.

    When the severe cold arrived, water froze instantly, and the ice layer on the Yellow River was more than a meter thick, allowing even heavy trucks to pass over it. It was indeed not an easy task for the soldiers to work on the frozen Yellow River in temperatures of minus twenty or thirty degrees Celsius; especially the soldiers in the caissons, who felt like they were in an ice cellar. When they came out of the caissons, everyone's head was covered with a layer of frost. Whenever this happened, the soldiers naturally thought of the heroic image of martyr Luo Shengjiao, who jumped into the icy river to rescue Korean children. Yu Guoqiang, the deputy squad leader of the first company, and Li Changtai, were shivering and their faces turned blue because their water boots were leaking, but they gritted their teeth and insisted on working, without saying a word about being "cold." When the company commander saw that something was wrong, he quickly asked, "Are your water boots leaking?" "No!" "Are you sick?" "No, I can still eat three or four bowls of rice in one meal!" "That's not right!" the company commander said decisively, "You have the shivers, go to the small warm shed to warm up!"

    As a result, when they took off their water boots, their legs below the knees were already red and swollen, and a white mark would appear when pressed. The company commander asked them painfully why they didn't come up to rest, and they replied, "One less person means less strength, and what does this count for compared to Luo Shengjiao?"

    In those cold days of hardship, there were countless such touching stories throughout the bridge construction site.

    In the third month of spring, a new battle against ice floes began. The Yellow River here is somewhat peculiar. It freezes earlier than the upper reaches and thaws later. Once the ice floe season arrives, the ice blocks, like mountains and seas, rush down from the upper reaches, often causing great disasters. In order to prevent the piers that had not yet emerged from the water from being washed away, a "Flood Prevention Headquarters" was specially established on the construction site. Flood prevention sentries were dispatched from the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and a company and two artillery platoons were mobilized to join the flood prevention battle. Many soldiers wrote such letters of determination: "When the motherland needs it, I am willing to step forward, crush the Yellow River ice floes, and not allow the piers to suffer any damage!"

    The Yellow River began to flow with ice! This was the signal for battle! Thousands upon thousands of ice blocks, some as large as five thousand to ten thousand square meters, collided with each other with a clanging sound, all rushing downstream! At the bottleneck, they collided with each other and accumulated into high ice dams, blocking the water of the Yellow River! At this time, artillery fire rumbled on both sides of the Yellow River, and the sound of thousands of packages of explosives exploding shook the sky and the earth, even shattering the glass windows in the barracks.

    On this day, people from the entire detachment came to the riverbank to watch and support this fierce battle between man and nature! Amidst the rumbling artillery fire and the cracking of ice blocks, the soldiers built wooden planks on the cracked ice blocks, put on life jackets, and bravely delivered explosive packages to the large ice blocks, just as the soldiers' ballad said: Step on the Yellow River and reverse the flow, Move Mount Tai as a pillow.

    How heroic and optimistic the soldiers were in the face of difficulties! It was this tenacious revolutionary will that enabled them to finally conquer the natural barrier of the Yellow River and allow the bridge to safely pass through the ice floe season.

    Leap Forward Again and Again

    This spring, news of the Great Leap Forward across the country and reports of victory from various construction fronts reached the bridge construction site. Letters from home also reported good news to the soldiers, especially the news that Chairman Mao visited various provinces, cities, and factory cooperatives, which made the soldiers even happier. Soldiers from Sichuan jumped up and said, "Chairman Mao has come to our hometown." All this good news boosted the soldiers' soaring enthusiasm. The original plan was for the Sandaokan Bridge to open to traffic at the end of October. Since the Great Leap Forward, after enthusiastic discussions by all officers and soldiers, the opening date has been gradually advanced from the end of October to "October 1st" - "September 1st" - "August 1st." Finally, the unit's Party committee more clearly put forward the resounding slogan of "Fight hard for three months, ensure the opening to traffic on 'July 1st,' and dedicate it to the Party's birthday."

    包兰路上的钢铁战士
    解放军报记者　尚力科
    一个晴朗的日子，记者乘坐包（头）兰（州）铁路北段这条新线上的火车，来到了三道坎黄河大桥的工地上。在这里，英雄的铁道兵战士们，战胜了内蒙古地区特大的风沙，征服了黄河天险，提前四个半月，架起了一座英雄的桥梁。
    一年多来，铁道兵战士们是怎样生活过来的，今天回顾一下，是一件很有意义的事情。
    风沙失去了威风
    去年春天，当担负这座桥梁工程的铁道兵某部队的官兵们，经过长途跋涉，来到黄河边上的时候，这里没有房舍，没有人家，有的只是一片荒凉的沙漠。除了在黄河东岸还可以看到古代烽火台的遗迹和听到一些有关杨家将在这里屯兵打仗的故事以外，多少世纪以来，这里一直是荒无人烟；这儿只有狂暴的风沙和奔腾咆哮的黄河。
    从战士们在河边上支起帐篷的那天起，大风就卷着黄沙，像狼嚎般地扑来。风起处，沙尘滚滚，天昏地暗，连沙漠里的黄羊和野兔，都吓得闭起眼睛，躲在沙窝里。风沙卷走了部队的帐篷，揭起了锅盖，刚刚煮熟的饭里落满了沙子。那些日子，战士们不得不在大风里睡觉，大风里吃饭，有时碰到特大的风沙，连锅灶也支不起来，吃饭的时候连牙都不敢对在一起。睡觉也同样的艰难，由于帐篷挡不住风沙，战士们往往在半夜里被沙子呛醒了，起来一看，满头满脸都是黄沙，有的战士就干脆戴着风镜和口罩睡觉。就在这样艰苦的环境下，战士们编出了许多英雄的歌谣：
    人说内蒙风沙大，
    铁道兵战士不害怕；
    今天吞风吃黄沙，
    明天彩虹草原挂。
    战士陈中元在吃饭的时候，“咯崩”一声嚼了块沙子，他一口吐出来说：“你将我的牙，等我修好了大桥，栽起了防风林，非把你制服不可！”的确，这些英雄的建设者们，从来没有向风沙屈服，他们在既无砖瓦，又无木料的情况下，奇迹般地用黄河的水和河边的泥土，打成了土坯，在沙滩上筑起了窑洞式的拱形营房。他们不仅有了办公室和宿舍，也有了自己的食堂和澡塘，有的还建设了双杠、木马和篮球场。短短的几个月，在这片荒凉的土地上出现了许许多多这样的工地新村，人们不胜惊喜地称它们为包兰线上的花园。
    战胜天险黄河
    这支铁道兵部队，虽然在战火弥漫的朝鲜战场上抢修过清川江大桥，也曾在祖国各地抢修过旧的和新建过无数座桥梁，但是，在沙漠里铺轨，在黄河上架桥，却还是第一次。如果说风沙是战士们最大的敌人，那么，黄河的激流、冰冻和春天的冰凌期，同样给建桥部队的官兵带来了很多麻烦。
    当严寒到来的时候，这里滴水成冰，黄河的冰层有一公尺多厚，连载重汽车都可以从冰上通过。战士们要冒着零下二、三十度的严寒，在冰冻的黄河上施工，的确不是一件容易的事情；特别在沉井里的战士，就像掉在冰窖里一样，从沉井里出来的时候，每个人的头上都顶着一层冰霜。每当这时候，战士们就很自然地想起了罗盛教烈士奋身跳进冰窟抢救朝鲜儿童的英雄形象。一连的副班长于国强和李长太，由于水靴漏水冻得浑身发抖，脸色发青，但是他们咬着牙坚持作业，谁也不说一个“冷”字。连长一看不对劲，忙问：“水靴漏水吗？”“不漏！”“你们有病吗？”“没有病，一顿饭还能吃三、四碗！”“不对！”连长斩钉截铁地说：“你们是打摆子，快到小暖篷里烤烤！”
    结果脱下水靴一看，他们膝盖以下已经红肿，一按一个白迹印。连长心疼地责问他们为什么不上来补一补，他们回答说：“少一个人就少一分力量，比起罗盛教来这算得了什么。”
    困难在那些寒冷的日子里，整个大桥工地上，不知有多少这样动人的故事。
    到了春三月，一场新的防凌战斗又开始了。这儿的黄河有些古怪，它比上游封冻封的早，开冻又开的晚，一到了流冰期，排山倒海似的冰块，从上游冲下来，常常造成极大的灾害。铁道兵战士为了使尚未打出水面的桥墩不被冲垮，工地上专门成立了“防凌指挥所”，黄河上游派出了防凌监视哨，并且调动了一个连和两个炮兵排投入了防凌战斗。有多少战士都写下了这样的决心书：“当祖国需要的时候，我愿挺身而出，粉碎黄河冰凌，不让桥墩受到任何损伤！”
    黄河开始流冰了！这是战斗的讯号！成千上万的冰块，大的大到五千到一万平方公尺，它们乒乒乓乓地互相撞击着，一齐朝下游涌来！到了咽喉的地方，它们互相碰撞，积成高高的冰坝，把黄河的水都堵了起来！这时，黄河两岸炮声隆隆，上千包炸药的轰响声，震天动地，连营房里的玻璃窗子都震碎了。
    这一天，全支队的人都来到河沿上观看和支援这场人和自然的激烈战斗！在隆隆的炮声和冰块的炸裂声中，战士们在裂开的冰块上搭起了木板，带上救生圈，到大冰块上英勇的投送炸药包，正像战士的歌谣上说的那样：脚踏黄河水倒流，搬倒泰山当枕头。
    战士们在困难面前，多么豪迈乐观，正是这种顽强的革命意志，使他们终于战胜了天险黄河，使大桥安全地度过了流冰期。
    跃进再跃进
    今年春天，全国大跃进的消息和各个建设战线上的捷报，传到了大桥工地上。家乡的来信，也纷纷向战士们报捷，特别是毛主席走访各个省市和工厂合作社的消息，更加使战士们乐坏了。四川籍的战士跳起来说：“毛主席到我们家乡啦。”这一切喜讯，鼓起了战士们冲天干劲。三道坎大桥原计划是10月底通车，大跃进以来，经过全体官兵热烈讨论以后，通车时间已由10月底逐步提前到“十一”——“九一”——“八一”，最后部队党委更明确提出了“苦战三月，确保‘七一’通车，给党的生日献礼”的响亮号召。（附图片）
