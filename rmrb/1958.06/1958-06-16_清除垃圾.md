　　Clearing Away the Rubbish

　　According to Saigon newspapers, the proliferation of American pornographic films in South Vietnam has aroused widespread indignation among people of all strata in South Vietnam. Many people have written to newspapers, demanding that the import of such obscene things be prohibited. A student even suggested holding an "Anti-Degradation Film Day" or "Clearing Away Rubbish Day" to throw American pornographic films into the trash.

　　It is indeed reasonable for this South Vietnamese student to call American pornographic films "rubbish" and solemnly demand that they be cleared away. Even the Saigon "Free Vietnamese News" pointed out: "The Hollywood films shipped to South Vietnam are of no benefit to us, and Western pornographic films have poisoned the entire young generation of South Vietnam." From this vivid fact, we can see that even in South Vietnam, which is so tightly controlled by the American imperialists, the so-called American way of life has already begun to stink among the broad masses.

    清除垃圾
    据西贡报纸消息，美国黄色电影在南越的泛滥，已经引起南越各阶层人民的广泛愤慨。许多人写信给报纸，要求禁止输入这种下流的东西。一个学生并建议举行一个“反对堕落影片日”或者“清除垃圾日”，把美国的黄色影片扔到垃圾箱里去。
    这位南越学生把美国的黄色影片称为“垃圾”，并严正地要求予以清除，的确是很有道理的。就是西贡的“自由越南人报”也指出：“运到南越来的好莱坞影片，对我们一点好处也没有，西方的黄色影片毒害了南越整个的年青一代。”从这件生动的事实中可以看到，即使在美帝国主义者如此严密控制下的南越，所谓美国生活方式也已经在广大群众中发臭了。
