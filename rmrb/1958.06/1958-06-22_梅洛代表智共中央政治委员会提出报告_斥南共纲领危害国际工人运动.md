Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Santiago dispatch: The Chilean Communist Party's newspaper "El Siglo" published on June 3rd the report made by Garvarino Melo, representing the Central Political Committee of the Chilean Communist Party, to the 28th Plenary Session of the Chilean Communist Party. In the report, Melo criticized the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Melo said: "At the 26th Plenary Session, we firmly supported the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the declaration signed by representatives of Communist Parties from various countries celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. These two documents strengthened the struggle for peace and the ideological unity of the international communist movement. The first document was, and still is, of particular importance because it clearly and firmly emphasizes the most basic principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding the struggle for socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby refuting and shattering the non-Marxist-Leninist erroneous ideas that appeared in some communist parties after the 20th Congress of the CPSU. This document was, and still is, a blow to the enemies of socialism who dreamed of ideologically disintegrating the communist ranks and splitting the socialist camp. All socialist countries and communist parties, except Yugoslavia and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, are closely united around the principles indicated in this document."

Melo pointed out, "The Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia passed a program that is truly revisionist to Marxism-Leninism, and therefore all communist and workers' parties have a duty to condemn this kind of ideological smuggling."

"The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia creates a set of anti-Leninist theories of the state. As everyone knows, Lenin pointed out that the capitalist state, even the most democratic republic, is merely the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat. However, when the Yugoslav comrades talk about the bourgeois state, they believe in their program that 'the state and the state machine, while undertaking major economic functions, acquire their independent economic foundation, and the new social role of the state machine grows on this basis.' They also said: 'In order to obtain its independent functions, the state machine places itself above society, while showing certain tendencies to restrict the role of private capital and the role of the working class.'"

"While beautifying the capitalist state in this way, they even say that in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries except Yugoslavia, the state has become or is becoming a tool opposed to society. On the other hand, the Yugoslav comrades also belittle the leading role of the party in socialist construction, which can only lead to—as it has already led to in their country—serious errors and backwardness in socialist construction, leading to the weakening of proletarian ideology and the prosperity of bourgeois ideology in many aspects. The mistakes made by the Yugoslav comrades can probably be explained by this fact."

"What is even worse is (I will not go into their many revisionist expressions in other aspects for the time being) their erroneous understanding of the international situation, of the role of the Soviet Union in the struggle for socialism, for the independence of all peoples, and for world peace, their view of the essence of the socialist camp and its peaceful policies, and their view of the importance and nature of the alliance of socialist countries. Specifically, in all these aspects, although the Yugoslav comrades made some verbal reservations, they actually portrayed the socialist camp as something similar in policy to the capitalist camp. The Yugoslav comrades said that the world is divided into 'two hostile military-political blocs,' placed these two blocs on an equal footing, denied the peaceful and democratic nature of the socialist state group, and advocated a policy of a third position."

Melo emphasized: "These are not just issues involving the Yugoslav comrades, nor are they just issues involving the profound ideological differences between the Yugoslav communists and the communist parties of socialist countries that have already expressed their opinions on their program. No, these are issues related to the entire world communist movement, issues related to all those who are fighting for socialism. In many capitalist countries, including our own, the working class is paving the way for itself to seize power; in this case, the tendency to revise the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and the leading role of the proletariat becomes an international danger. In addition, in all countries, including our own, the basic and decisive thing is to fully clarify international issues in the workers' movement and the people's movement, in order to avoid confusion and betrayal, and to make it impossible for the enemy to secretly smuggle goods into this movement tomorrow. Chile has had fascists and bourgeois nationalists who have repeatedly put forward the erroneous slogan of 'neither the United States nor the Soviet Union,' which coincides with the extremely erroneous views of the Yugoslav comrades."

"When we understand the seriousness of these ideological smuggled goods, we have an obligation to sound the alarm and call on all party members and leaders to further study Marxist-Leninist science, spread this science among the masses, and create conditions to make revisionist claims impossible to appear in Chile."

    梅洛代表智共中央政治委员会提出报告
    斥南共纲领危害国际工人运动
    新华社19日讯  圣地亚哥消息：智利共产党机关报“世纪报”6月3日刊载了加耳瓦里诺·梅洛代表智利共产党中央政治委员会向智利共产党二十八中全会所作的报告。梅洛在报告中批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领。
    梅洛说：“我们在二十六中全会上坚决支持社会主义国家共产党（和工人党）的宣言及世界各国共产党参加庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的代表签字的宣言。这两个文件加强了争取和平的斗争及国际共产主义运动在思想上的统一。第一个文件过去是，现在仍然是具有特别重大价值，因为它明确而坚定地强调马列主义关于争取社会主义的斗争及关于无产阶级专政的最基本的原则，从而驳斥并粉碎了在苏共第二十次代表大会以后曾在某些共产党内出现的非马克思列宁主义的错误思想。这个文件对于那些梦想使共产主义队伍思想涣散、梦想使社会主义阵营各国分裂的社会主义敌人，过去和现在都是一个打击。所有社会主义国家和共产党，除南斯拉夫及南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟外，都紧密地团结在这个文件所指出的原则的周围。”
    梅洛指出，“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会通过了一个纲领，这个纲领对马列主义说来是真正的修正主义，因此各国共产党和工人党都有义务对这种在思想形态方面偷运私货的行径加以谴责。”
    “南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领创造一套反列宁主义的国家论。大家知道，列宁指出过，资本主义国家，即使是最民主的共和国，也不过是资产阶级对无产阶级的专政罢了。但是南斯拉夫同志在谈到资产阶级国家时，却在自己的纲领中认为‘国家和国家机器在承担起重大经济职能的同时，获得其独立的经济基础，而国家机器的新的社会作用又在这个基础上增长着。’他们又说：‘国家机器为获得其独立职能，把自己置于社会之上，同时表现出某些限制私人资本作用和工人阶级作用的倾向。’”
    “他们在这样美化资本主义国家的同时，竟说什么在苏联及除了南斯拉夫以外的其他社会主义国家中，国家已经或正在变为与社会相对立的工具。在另一方面，南斯拉夫同志又贬低党在社会主义建设中的领导作用，这就只会导致到——正如在他们那里已经导致到的——严重的错误及社会主义建设方面的落后，导致到无产阶级思想的削弱及资产阶级思想在许多方面的兴隆。南斯拉夫同志所犯的错误，大概可从这一事实得到说明吧。”
    “尤有甚者是（我暂不去谈他们在其他方面的许多修正主义的表述）他们对国际形势，对苏联在争取社会主义、争取各国人民的独立及争取世界和平的斗争中所起的作用抱着错误的认识，是他们对社会主义阵营的实质及其和平政策的看法，是他们对社会主义国家联盟的重要性和性质的看法。具体说来，在所有这些方面，南斯拉夫同志虽然也作了某些口头上的保留，但实际上他们还是把社会主义阵营说成是在政策上与资本主义阵营类似的东西。南斯拉夫同志说什么世界分裂为‘两个敌对的军事政治集团’，把这两个集团放在同等地位，否认社会主义国家集团的和平及民主的性质，并鼓吹第三种立场的政策。”
    梅洛强调说：“这些都不只是牵涉到南斯拉夫同志的问题，也不只是牵涉到标志南斯拉夫共产主义者与已经对他们的纲领发表了自己意见的社会主义国家的共产党之间的深刻思想分歧的问题。不，这些是与整个世界共产主义运动有关的问题，是与一切为社会主义而斗争的人有关的问题。在许多资本主义国家，包括在我们国家里，工人阶级正在为夺取政权而为自己开辟道路；在这种情况下，修正马克思列宁主义关于国家及无产阶级领导作用的理论的倾向，就成为一种国际危险。此外，在所有国家，包括在我们国家，基本的和有决定性的东西，就是要在工人运动和人民运动中完全弄清国际问题，以便避免纷乱和背叛行为，并使敌人不可能在明天把私货偷偷运到这个运动中来。智利曾有法西斯分子和资产阶级民族主义分子，他们不只一次提出‘既不要美国也不要苏联’的错误口号，这个口号与南斯拉夫同志的极错误观点，正相吻合。”
    “我们了解了这些思想上的私货的严重性时，就有义务发出警报，号召所有党员和领导人进一步深入研究马克思列宁主义科学，在群众中传布这种科学，创造条件来使修正主义主张不可能在智利出现。”
