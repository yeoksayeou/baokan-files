Another High-Yield Rapeseed County – Nanhui
    Over 50,000 Mu of Rapeseed Achieve an Average Yield of 258 Jin per Mu

    (Report from our newspaper) The more than 50,000 mu of rapeseed in Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, has been threshed, achieving an average yield of 258 jin per mu, roughly a two-fold increase compared to last year. Among them, over 10,000 mu yielded over 300 jin per mu. Lu Xulian, the leader of the eighth team of Hengbin First Commune, cultivated a "Rapeseed King" plant that was five chi tall, fifteen chi in circumference, with a root thirty-two centimeters thick, forty-four large branches, four hundred and four small branches, and over 21,000 pods. This single "Rapeseed King" plant can produce one and a half jin of rapeseed, equivalent to the yield of sixty ordinary rapeseed plants.

    In the past, the county's rapeseed yield had always been low, averaging less than 85 jin per mu. The "conditions theory" was the fundamental reason for the low rapeseed production. Last year, the "conditions theory" was criticized from top to bottom, leadership was strengthened, and measures were taken to inspect oilseed production alongside grain production, and to arrange oilseed production alongside grain production, with comprehensive planning and unified deployment. In terms of technical measures, a series of measures were tightly grasped, including improved varieties, close planting, fertilization, and strengthened field management. Consequently, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved.

    The rapid leap forward in rapeseed production has brought great inspiration and encouragement to the people of the entire county, and their thinking has been greatly liberated. The Nanhui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is summarizing this year's harvest experience, preparing for next year's production, and striving for an even greater harvest.

    又一个油菜高产县——南汇
    五万多亩油菜平均亩产菜籽258斤
    本报讯　江苏南汇县五万多亩油菜已经脱粒完毕，平均亩产二百五十八斤，约比去年增产二倍。其中亩产三百斤以上的有一万多亩。横滨一社八队队长陆叙连栽培的一棵油菜王，身高五尺，周抱十五尺，根粗三十二公分，有四十四个大枝，四百零四个小枝，二万一千多个荚子，单这一棵油菜王就可产油菜籽一斤半，等于普通油菜六十棵的产量。
    过去，这个县的油菜产量一直很低，平均亩产不到八十五斤，条件论是油菜低产的根本原因。去年，自上而下地批判了条件论，加强了领导，采取检查粮食生产也检查油料生产，布置粮食生产也布置油料生产的措施，全面安排，一起部署。在技术措施上，紧紧地抓住了改良品种、密植、施肥、加强田间管理等一系列措施。因而获得了空前大丰收。
    油菜的高速跃进给全县人民带来了极大的启发和鼓舞，思想大大解放。中共南汇县委正在总结今年的丰收经验，作好明年生产准备，争取更大丰收。
