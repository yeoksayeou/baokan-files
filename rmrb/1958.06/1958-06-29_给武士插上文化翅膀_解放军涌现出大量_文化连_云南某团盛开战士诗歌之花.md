    Giving Warriors Cultural Wings
    Large Numbers of "Culture Companies" Emerge in the People's Liberation Army
    Soldier Poetry Blossoms in a Yunnan Regiment
    Xinhua News Agency, 28th - A wave of eliminating illiteracy has rapidly formed in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. A good atmosphere of learning has become widespread in the troops, with "people not leaving their books, books not leaving their people" and "everyone a student, teachers everywhere," resulting in rapid progress in learning. A large number of "Culture Platoons" and "Culture Companies" that have eliminated illiteracy have emerged in various units. In Kunming, the Air Force, and other units, there even appeared "Culture Regiments" that basically eliminated illiteracy after a month of hard work. At the victory celebration of "Conquering the Cultural Fortress" in a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region, seventy-four soldiers were examined. After two months of study, they had progressed from being illiterate to being able to recognize, speak, write, and use 1,500 characters, able to read popular newspapers and books, able to write letters and drafts, and able to take simple notes. Currently, activities such as buying books, reading newspapers, and writing poems and ballads are very active in many "Culture Companies." Reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and writing articles of thousands of characters is no longer limited to a few people, but is widespread among the soldiers.
    This illiteracy elimination movement has been vigorously launched by various units in response to the Party's call for a cultural revolution, determined to give warriors cultural wings in the shortest possible time, displaying heroic spirit. Since April, various units have formulated Great Leap Forward plans for eliminating illiteracy. Party committees have personally taken charge, issuing calls to the troops to "Conquer the Cultural Mountain" and "March Towards Culture." Many leading cadres have gone deep into the companies to establish illiteracy elimination "experimental plots." Units and individuals who have consistently achieved excellent results in cultural learning over the years, such as the Shanghai Garrison, a warehouse of a certain unit of the Lanzhou Military Region, and a certain Hui ethnic minority squad stationed in the Qaidam Basin, have been awarded the title of "Pacesetters" in the march towards culture. Soldiers are full of fighting spirit and energy in the illiteracy elimination movement, determined to be revolutionary soldiers who are both cultured and military-minded.
    The illiteracy elimination campaign in the troops has implemented the working method of the mass line. Many units have adopted the method of "high leading low, strong leading weak," "teaching one character if you know one," "learning one character and passing it on," and "everyone being a teacher," which has yielded good results. The soldiers "carry three things everywhere" (books, paper, pens) and are "diligently learning, diligently teaching, diligently asking questions at all times," "recognizing characters by looking at objects," and "learning as they do," utilizing every bit of time for learning. A certain company stationed in Xinjiang built a large sand table as a "cultural garden." During breaks and after meals, the soldiers used their hands as pens and sand as paper to practice writing characters. The Fifth Company of a certain unit guarding the Xiamen front line achieved "recognizing characters when going out, recognizing characters when entering, recognizing characters when looking up." After learning the new characters, a certain unit stationed in Yunnan then launched a campaign to "write hundreds of sentences, connect five hundred words, read thousands of articles, and copy ten thousand characters." A certain unit of the Air Force vigorously advocated "reading while recognizing characters, and writing while copying characters." As a result, learning progress has been rapid. The soldiers sang about their joyful mood, saying: "The sun rises and shines in all directions, the day before yesterday I was still illiterate, after three days of intensive study my eyes opened, and my heart is bright. In the past, culture controlled me, today I use it; having become the master of culture, I fly to climb the mountain of science."

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zheng reports: Once warriors have cultural wings, they can also win the laurel of poets. Soldier poetry is blossoming in a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Yunnan border.
    "The construction of the motherland is advancing rapidly, the enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward is like a surging tide, resolutely grasp the key to culture and science, and ride rockets to explore the mysteries of the universe." With such heroic spirit, the soldiers of the entire regiment overcame various difficulties in learning culture, and since May of this year, they have launched a campaign of "singing the Great Leap Forward with ten thousand poems." In less than a month, from the regiment headquarters to the companies, everywhere was plastered with soldiers' poems. The clubs of each company could not accommodate all the poems, so poetry gardens were also opened in platoons and squads, but the poems quickly broke out of the "gardens" and climbed onto the soldiers' bedsides. So far, 4,231 poems have appeared, of which one company created more than 700 poems in ten days. Yu Huabiao, a soldier who only knew 650 characters, wrote 216 poems by himself, becoming the "poetry king" of the entire company. Many ethnic minority soldiers have also become excellent poets.
    These people's soldiers inherited the excellent tradition of writing "gun barrel poems" during the war years, writing about what they do in the form of new poems, folk songs, flower lantern operas, songs, and Sichuan flower drum tunes, boldly creating and enthusiastically singing for socialism.
    Soldiers often take advantage of breaks, meals, entertainment, and meetings to recite their poems aloud to their comrades. For example, why launch a great debate? Soldier Zhang Bingde recited a poem: "Parting the clouds to see Venus, soldiers debate point by point, the train can only move with steam, clarify the principles before doing things." He timely answered the questions of some soldiers. Soldier Zhang Lize also wrote a poem praising the power of peace during current affairs studies: "East wind, east wind, rushes straight to the west, the power is great, overwhelming the west wind, eternal victory belongs to the east wind." In addition, there are many poems describing military training, duty, and praising good people and good deeds. A soldier in a certain company wrote a poem on the wall praising his battalion commander: "Our battalion commander is like a young man, flying in the clouds, drilling in the fog. When it rains and the road is slippery, he always takes the lead to rush forward. We must learn from the battalion commander, train hard to defend the country."
    While launching the ten thousand poems campaign, this regiment also launched a writing campaign of "copying ten thousand characters, reading thousands of articles, connecting five hundred words, and writing hundreds of sentences." When writing hundreds of sentences, many soldiers used the genres of novels and plays to promote the Great Leap Forward of the motherland, while others used crosstalk to educate new recruits. At a recent evening party, the drama "Visiting the Countryside," written and performed by Liu Xirong and eight other soldiers, only lasted six minutes, but vividly reflected the new face of the Great Leap Forward in the countryside and was very popular.

    给武士插上文化翅膀
    解放军涌现出大量“文化连”
    云南某团盛开战士诗歌之花
    新华社28日讯　扫除文盲运动的热潮已在中国人民解放军中迅速地形成。各部队普遍出现“人不离书，书不离人”，“人人是学生，到处有先生”的好学风气，学习成绩突飞猛进。各部队扫除了文盲的“文化排”、“文化连”大量出现。昆明、空军等部队，还出现了苦战一月基本上扫除了文盲的“文化团”。南京部队某部在“攻克文化堡垒”的祝捷大会上，考核了七十四名士兵，他们经过两个月的学习，已经由文盲达到了会认、会讲、会写、会用一千五百字，能够读通俗报刊、书籍，能够写信、写稿，能够作简单笔记的水平。目前，在许多“文化连”队里，买书、读报、写诗歌快板等活动十分活跃。读“毛泽东选集”，写上千字的文章已不是少数人，而是广大战士了。
    这个扫除文盲运动，是各部队响应党的文化革命号召，决心在最短的时间内，给武士插上文化翅膀的英雄气概下蓬勃展开的。4月份以来，各部队都订出了扫盲大跃进规划，党委亲自挂帅，向部队发出“攻克文化山”、“向文化大进军”的号召。许多领导干部纷纷深入连队，搞扫盲“试验田”。上海警备区、兰州部队某仓库、驻柴达木盆地某回民班等几年来坚持文化学习成绩优秀的单位和个人，都被荣立为向文化进军的“标兵”。战士们在扫盲运动中斗志昂扬，干劲十足，决心做一个文武双全的革命军人。
    部队扫盲贯彻实行了群众路线的工作方法。许多部队采用高带低，强带弱，会一字教一字，学一字传一字，人人当教员的群教群学的方法，收到良好的效果。战士们则“处处三带”（带书、纸、笔）“时时三勤”（勤教、勤学、勤问），“见物识字”、“做什么学什么”，利用点滴时间进行学习。驻新疆部队某连筑起一个“文化园地”大沙盘，每逢课余饭后，战士们以手代笔，以沙为纸练习写字。守卫在厦门前线某部五连做到了“出门识字，进门识字，抬头识字”。驻云南部队某部在学好生字以后，接着还展开了“写百篇话，联五百词，读千篇文，抄万个字”的运动。空军某部则大力提倡“边识字边读书，边抄字边写话”。因此学习成绩突飞猛进。战士们歌唱自己的愉快心情说：太阳出来照四方，前天我还是文盲，突击三天睁了眼，我的心中亮堂堂。过去文化管着我，今天我来使用它；当了文化的主人，飞步再翻科学山。
    新华社昆明28日电　新华社记者陈铮报道：一旦插上了文化的翅膀，武士也能夺得诗人的桂冠。中国人民解放军驻云南边疆某团队盛开战士诗歌之花。
    “祖国的建设一日千里，跃进的热情像澎湃的海涛，坚决掌握文化科学的钥匙，驾着火箭去探索宇宙的奥妙。”全团战士们以这样的英雄气概，克服了学习文化中的各种困难，从今年5月份起又开展了“万首诗歌唱跃进”的运动。不到一个月，从团部到连队，到处都贴满了战士的诗歌。各个连队的俱乐部容纳不了，排、班里也开辟了诗歌的园地，可是诗歌又很快冲出了“园地”，爬上了战士们的床头。到目前为止，已经出现的诗歌达四千二百三十一首，其中有一个连队的战士十天内就创作七百多首。只识六百五十个字的战士余华标，竟一个人作诗二百一十六首，成了全连的“诗大王”。许多少数民族战士也都成了出色的诗人了。
    这些人民战士继承了战争年代写“枪杆诗”的优良传统，以新诗、山歌、花灯、歌曲以及四川花鼓等形式，做什么写什么，大胆地创作，热情地为社会主义歌唱。
    战士们经常趁休息、吃饭、娱乐和开会的时候，把自己作的诗在战友们面前高声朗诵。如为啥要开展大辩论？战士张炳德便吟诗一首：“拨开云雾见金星，战士辩论针对针，火车有气才能走，做事先把理弄清。”及时地解答了有些战士的疑问。战士张礼泽在时事学习中，也即兴作了一首歌颂和平力量强大的诗：“东风东风，直往西冲，力量很大，压倒西风，永远胜利，属于东风。”此外，还有许多描述练兵、执勤和表扬好人好事的诗歌。某连战士在墙头上写了一首表扬自己营长的诗：“咱营长，赛青年，云里飞，雾里钻。天下雨，小路滑，他每次带头往前窜。咱们要，学营长，练好本领保国防。”
    在开展万首诗歌运动的同时，这个团队还展开了“抄万个字、读千篇文、联五百词、写百篇话”的作文运动。许多战士在写百篇话时，有的采用小说、剧本的体裁宣传祖国的大跃进，有的以相声的形式教育刚入伍的新战友。在最近一次晚会上，刘锡荣等八个战士自编自演的话剧“农村访问”，只演了六分钟，却生动地反映了农村大跃进的新面貌，很受大家欢迎。
