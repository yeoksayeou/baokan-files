Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The level of automation in Soviet iron and steelmaking has surpassed all capitalist countries, including the United States, and ranks first in the world.

The charging process of all Soviet blast furnaces has been fully automated. The number of measuring and inspection instruments and automated devices used in iron and steel production exceeds that of the United States. Currently, over 90% of pig iron and steel in the Soviet Union are produced using automated blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces.

All Soviet blast furnaces can automatically regulate the temperature of hot air. Approximately 90% of blast furnaces are equipped with regulators for automatically adjusting the hot blast temperature, 67% of large blast furnaces have regulators for adjusting blast furnace gas pressure, and 90% of blast furnaces can automatically regulate the thermal regime of hot blast stoves. The automation of blast furnace production can increase the productivity of blast furnaces by 7% to 10%. In addition, the degree of automation in steelmaking and rolling production in the Soviet steel industry is also continuously improving.

From 1959 to 1965, thirty-three new blast furnaces in the Soviet Union, all blast furnaces that have been completely renovated, and blast furnaces currently in production, will all be equipped with new automated devices and regulation systems.

Soviet experts are currently conducting research on the complete automation of blast furnace production. According to calculations, after the implementation of full automation, the productivity of blast furnaces can be further increased by 1.5% to 2%.

Currently, Soviet experts are also studying the construction of a steel factory that can make the entire steel production process (from loading furnace materials to manufacturing steel) an automated continuous production process. The research achievements of Soviet metallurgists in areas such as using oxygen for steelmaking and continuous casting of steel ingots have brought the problem of establishing such a steel factory closer to a solution.

    从世界第一再向前跃进
    苏联钢铁生产即将全面自动化
    正在设计从装料到成材连续生产的工厂
    新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联炼铁和炼钢的自动化水平已经超过包括美国在内的一切资本主义国家，而居世界第一位。
    苏联所有高炉的装料工作已经全部自动化，在炼铁和炼钢生产中采用的测量检查仪器和自动化装置的数量已经超过美国。现在，苏联90％以上的生铁和钢都是用自动化的高炉和平炉生产的。
    苏联的所有高炉都能自动调节热风的温度，约有90％的高炉装置了自动调节鼓风温度的调节器，67％的大型高炉装有调节高炉煤气压力的调节器，90％的高炉可以自动调节热风炉的热工制度。高炉生产的自动化可以使高炉的生产率提高7％到10％。此外，苏联钢铁工业中炼钢和压延生产的自动化程度也在不断提高。
    在1959年到1965年期间，苏联有三十三座新的高炉、全部经过改建的高炉、以及现在正在进行生产的高炉，将全部装备上新的自动化装置和调节系统。
    苏联的专家们现在正在进行高炉生产全面自动化的研究工作。据计算，在实现全面自动化以后，高炉的生产率还可以再提高1.5％到2％。
    目前，苏联专家还正在研究建设一种可以使整个钢铁生产过程（从装运炉料到制成钢材）成为一个自动化的连续生产过程的钢铁工厂。苏联冶金学家在利用氧气冶炼钢铁和连续铸钢锭等方面的研究成就，已经使得建立这样一种钢铁工厂的问题接近解决。（附图片）
