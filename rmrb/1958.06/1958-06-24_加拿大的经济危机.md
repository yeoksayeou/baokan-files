Canada's Economic Crisis
Zhang Zhenya

The American economic crisis is impacting the entire capitalist world. And taking the brunt of the impact is Canada, which is most deeply economically dependent on the United States.

From the third quarter of 1954, Canada experienced nearly three years of investment boom. Under the influence of the American economic stagnation last April, its industrial production began to decline. By the fourth quarter of last year, total industrial output had fallen by 4.5% compared to the first quarter. The economic situation deteriorated further in the first quarter of this year. In the first four months of this year, steel production fell by 14% compared to the same period last year, and automobile production in March fell by 2.4% compared to the same month last year. Major industrial sectors such as the pulp and paper industry, the timber industry, the non-ferrous metal industry, the mining industry, the petroleum industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the durable goods industry, the textile industry, and construction (especially housing construction) have also fallen into the quagmire of overproduction.

While production generally declined in various industrial sectors, the number of unemployed in Canada surged from 174,000 in August of last year to 880,000 in March of this year. The unemployment rate is approaching the record of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Import and export trade also began to decline. Canada's total export value in the first quarter of this year fell by 24% compared to last year, and the total import value fell by 12.2%.

In the face of the end of prosperity, enterprises have generally implemented austerity measures. In the third quarter of last year, Canadian enterprises' investment in machinery and equipment decreased by 13% compared to the same quarter of 1956, calculated at constant prices. The trend of investment contraction continued to develop in the first quarter of this year. The decline in investment has already prompted warnings from Canadian bourgeois economists that the economic "recession" will not be restored in the short term.

The impact of the American economic crisis on the Canadian economy is the fastest and most obvious. This is due to the close connection between its economy and the American economy. In 1957, the net value of American private overseas investment reached 37.5 billion US dollars, of which investment in Canada reached 13.7 billion, accounting for more than one-third of its total investment. At the same time, the proportion of American investment in foreign investment in Canada is as high as 76%. According to the report of the Canadian Royal Commission, as early as 1955, 95% of Canada's automobile industry, 68% of the petroleum industry, 51% of the chemical industry, and 48% of the pulp and paper industry were controlled by American capital. Under the unrestrained penetration of American monopoly capital, Canada's economy has become increasingly dependent on the United States and has shown abnormal development. For example, Canada's largest forest pulp and paper industry accounts for 20% of the national income in terms of total product value, and its export volume ranks first in the capitalist world (Canada produces more than half of the capitalist world's newsprint). However, more than 80% of Canada's exported pulp and paper products are absorbed by the United States. Canada's second largest industrial sector, non-ferrous metal mining and smelting, also relies on the American market as its main outlet. Its rich iron ore in Labrador is monopolized by the United States Steel Corporation. Other products such as petroleum, uranium ore, and canned food are also largely exported to the United States. Trade with the United States accounts for 25% of Canada's gross national product. On the other hand, 73% of Canada's imports are supplied by the United States. These are mainly various industrial manufactured products, such as electrical machinery and equipment, auto parts, tractors, and locomotives. All this naturally makes any fluctuation in the American economy inevitably affect Canada.

The decline in the American construction industry and overall economic activity in 1957 first hit the export of Canada's timber and pulp and paper industries. In 1956, the total value of such products exported from Canada to the United States reached 1.6 billion US dollars, accounting for 30% of Canada's total export value of 5.288 billion US dollars that year. However, the export of such products to the United States suddenly dropped to 1.2 billion US dollars last year, that is to say, it fell by 25%, resulting in a 11% drop in the output of Canadian sawn timber and sleepers last year. The output of the pulp and paper industry also decreased by 3%. Since Canada's timber and pulp and paper industry surpasses any other domestic industrial sector in terms of total product value, investment equipment, number of employees, and electricity consumption, the impact of this situation on the Canadian national economy is not difficult to imagine.

The second most seriously affected is Canada's second largest industrial sector, the non-ferrous metal industry. In 1957, the total output of this industrial sector decreased by 7%. Taking the aluminum manufacturing industry as an example, this industrial sector has been expanding its productivity after the war under the stimulation of arms expansion and war preparation by the Canadian and American governments. In 1957, the production equipment capacity of the Canadian aluminum manufacturing industry increased by 7.7%. However, the overproduction of aluminum in the United States caused Canada's aluminum exports to fall by 5.6%, and its output to fall by 9%, resulting in serious undercapacity. The export of other non-ferrous metals such as copper was also affected by the sluggish American market, falling by 18% in 1957, and the export of zinc also fell by 13%. The production of the entire non-ferrous metal industry is in a state of recession.

Even the petroleum industry, which once saw a sharp increase in exports in the first quarter of last year due to the disruption of the Suez Canal, is now seeing a declining production trend. Canada's petroleum industry increased its exports to the United States in the first half of last year due to insufficient crude oil supply from refineries in California, United States, thus increasing the total output of 1957 by 7% compared with 1956. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, due to the reduction in American demand for petroleum, the volume of Canadian petroleum extraction in December dropped to the lowest level in the past two and a half years. The situation deteriorated further in the first quarter of this year.

The reason for this situation is obviously the American economic crisis. However, there are also more important factors for the outbreak of the economic crisis in Canada. This is that the internal conditions for the occurrence of an economic crisis in Canada have matured.

Like the United States, because of its location in North America, Canada's economy was not damaged in the Second World War. On the contrary, its productivity was greatly expanded. In the seven years from 1937 to 1944, Canada's industrial production doubled in seven years under the stimulation of the military boom. However, as soon as the war ended, it suffered a severe economic decline in 1945-1946, just like the United States. Then in 1947-1948, relying on the renewal of fixed capital in the domestic consumer goods industrial sector delayed during the war, the economy began to rise again. This fixed capital investment boom gradually became saturated after 1948 and slowed down. Therefore, the Canadian economy showed a situation close to stagnation in 1949. In 1950, the American war of aggression against Korea broke out, and Canada also actively expanded its armaments. As a result, its economy began to rise sharply again under the stimulation of the military boom. From 1950 to 1953, Canada's domestic investment was mainly concentrated in the national defense industry and strategic raw material industry. The most prominent example in this regard is the development of Canada's aircraft manufacturing industry. This industry could not even be included in the ranks of Canada's top 40 largest industries in 1949. But under the stimulus of the Canadian government's large-scale expansion of the air force, it had risen to 16th place in 1952, and in 1953 it jumped to 8th place. Under this deformed military boom, Canada naturally experienced an economic decline like the United States after the end of the Korean War. From 1953 to 1954, its industrial production fell by 3% on an annual basis. However, from the second half of 1954, since other capitalist countries were experiencing a stage of post-war prosperity, Canada relied on the export market and began economic expansion again. From the second half of 1954 to the first quarter of 1957, a new investment upsurge was set off in Canada. This large-scale investment was used on the one hand to expand the national defense industry, build airports and highways, set up radar networks, and build some buildings with military strategic significance, and at the same time for export industries such as timber, papermaking, and metal mining, and sectors closely related to these export industries, such as hydropower generation (papermaking and aluminum manufacturing are the largest consumers of hydropower), fuel, power, and transportation equipment industries were also expanded. However, the stagnation of the American economy in the first quarter of 1957 and the subsequent end of the capitalist world market boom caused serious overproduction in Canada's export industries. In addition, the long-standing shrinking domestic market has greatly exceeded the entire industrial productivity, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the crisis.

From the above situation, it can be seen that: first, the ups and downs of Canada's post-war economy are roughly similar to those of the American economy; second, Canada's economy from 1950 to 1953 mainly relied on the boom of the military industry to maintain; third, Canada's economic prosperity after 1954 was maintained by further militarization of the economy and vigorous expansion of the export industry. The domestic market has long been unable to accommodate the huge production capacity caused by the long-term large-scale investment after the war. In fact, Canada's domestic market in recent years has also been maintained by the extreme expansion of consumer credit. For example, from the third quarter of 1951 to the third quarter of 1955, Canada's consumer credit increased from 1.1 billion Canadian dollars to more than 2.2 billion Canadian dollars. In addition, the decline in domestic housing construction in Canada last year and the plummeting output of various durable consumer goods are also clear evidence of the decline in people's purchasing power. For example, in 1957, in addition to the sharp drop in automobile production in Canada, refrigerators decreased by 15% compared with the previous year, washing machines decreased by 9%, television sets decreased by 24%, textile industry decreased by 4%, housing construction decreased by 11%...

All of this shows that this economic crisis in Canada broke out under the conditions that both domestic and international conditions have matured.

Like the American government, the Canadian government also adopted measures such as encouraging housing construction, relaxing credit, expanding public works, and lowering the rediscount rate of the Central Bank of Canada last year to delay the development of the crisis. In addition, it also implemented tax cuts in December last year. This tax cut is estimated to cost Canada at least 150 million Canadian dollars in tax revenue this year. Due to the excessive expenditures, Canadian Finance Minister Fleming recently said that a record deficit of more than 640 million US dollars will appear in the 1958-1959 fiscal year.

But despite this, the crisis is still deepening. At present, from various signs, Canada's economic crisis has converged with the American economic crisis and is rapidly trending downstream. This ominous cloud rising in North America is causing a great threat to Western Europe.

    加拿大的经济危机
    张振亚
    美国的经济危机正在冲击整个资本主义世界。而首当其冲的则是经济上依赖美国最深的加拿大。
    从1954年第三季起，加拿大曾经历了近三年的投资繁荣。去年4月在美国经济停滞的影响下，它的工业生产开始下降。到去年第四季工业总产量比第一季下跌了4.5％。今年第一季经济情况更趋恶化。今年头四个月，钢产量比去年同期下降了14％，小汽车产量3月份比去年同月下跌2.4％。主要工业部门像纸浆造纸工业、木材工业、有色金属工业、采矿工业、石油工业、机器制造业、耐用品工业、纺织工业以及建筑（特别是住房建筑）也都陷入生产过剩的泥潭。
    在各工业部门生产普遍下跌的同时，加拿大失业人数从去年8月的十七万四千人骤增至今年3月的八十八万人。失业比例已接近三十年代大危机时期的纪录。
    进出口贸易也开始下跌。加拿大今年第一季的出口总值比去年下跌24％，进口总值下跌12.2％。
    在繁荣结束的局面下，各企业纷纷实行紧缩。去年第三季加拿大各企业在机器设备上的投资额按不变价格计算比1956年同季度下降了13％。今年第一季投资紧缩趋势仍在发展。投资下降已经使加拿大资产阶级经济学者发出警告：经济“衰退”已非短期所能恢复。
    加拿大经济受美国经济危机影响最快也最明显。这是由于它的经济同美国的经济有密切联系的缘故。1957年美国私人海外投资净值达三百七十五亿美元，在加拿大的投资就达一百三十七亿，占它总投资额的三分之一强的比例。同时在加拿大的外国投资中，美国所占比例高达76％以上。根据加拿大皇家委员会的报告，早在1955年加拿大95％的汽车工业、68％的石油工业、51％的化学工业、48％的纸浆造纸工业都为美国资本控制。在美国大垄断资本这种毫无阻挡的渗入下，加拿大的经济遂日益依附美国而呈现畸形发展。例如加拿大最大的森林纸浆造纸工业，其产品总值占国民收入的20％，出口量占资本主义世界第一位（加拿大生产着资本主义世界一半以上的新闻纸）。但是加拿大出口的纸浆和造纸产品的80％以上都由美国吸纳。加拿大的第二个大工业部门有色金属开采和冶炼业，也是以美国市场为主要出路。它的刺布拉多的丰富铁矿石由美国钢铁公司所垄断。其它如石油、铀矿石、罐头食品等也无不以对美出口为大宗。同美国的贸易占了加拿大国民生产总值的25％。而另一方面加拿大73％的进口又是由美国供应。这里主要是各种工业制成品，如电气机械设备、汽车零件、拖拉机、机车车辆等。这一切就自然使美国经济的任何动荡都必然波及加拿大。
    1957年美国的建筑业和整个经济活动的下降使加拿大的木材、纸浆造纸工业的出口首先受到打击。1956年加拿大向美国出口的这类产品的总值高达十六亿美元，占加拿大是年全部出口总值五十二亿八千八百万美元的30％。但是去年这类产品的对美输出就突然下降到十二亿美元，也就是说跌落了25％，结果使加拿大的锯材和枕木的产量在去年下跌了11％。纸浆造纸工业的产量也下降了3％。由于加拿大的木材、纸浆造纸工业无论在产品总值、投资设备、雇用工人人数、电力消费方面都超过国内其它任何工业部门，所以这一情况对加拿大国民经济的打击是不难想像的。
    其次受到严重影响的是加拿大第二个最大的工业部门有色金属工业。1957年这个工业部门的总产量下降了7％。以制铝工业为例，这个工业部门在战后加拿大和美国政府扩军备战的刺激下，一直扩大着它的生产力。1957年加拿大制铝工业的生产设备能力提高了7.7％。但是美国铝的生产过剩却使加拿大铝的出口下降了5.6％，产量下降了9％，形成了严重的开工不足。其他有色金属如铜的出口，也是受美国市场不景气的影响，在1957年跌落了18％，锌的出口也下降了13％。整个有色金属工业的生产处在萎缩状态中。
    即以去年第一季度受苏伊士运河中断影响而一度出口骤增的石油工业来说，它的产量也正日趋下降。加拿大的石油工业在去年上半年曾因美国加里福尼亚州各油厂原油供应不足而增加了对美出口，因此使1957年全年的产量比1956年增加了7％。但是去年第四季，由于美国对石油需求的减少，12月加拿大石油开采量就下降到过去两年半以来的最低水平。到今年第一季情况更形恶化。
    造成这种情况的原因显然是由于美国的经济危机。不过加拿大的爆发经济危机也还有更重要的因素。这就是加拿大发生经济危机的内在条件已经成熟。
    同美国一样，由于地处北美洲，加拿大在二次世界大战中，经济不但未遭破坏。反而大大扩展了生产力。从1937年到1944年的七年中，加拿大工业生产在军事景气的刺激下于七年中增加了一倍。可是战争一结束，在1945—1946年它就像美国一样遭受了一次严重的经济下降。接着在1947—1948年它依靠了战时推迟的国内消费品工业部门更新固定资本，经济又开始上升。这一固定资本投资繁荣到1948年以后渐趋饱和状态而减缓了速度。因此1949年加拿大的经济出现了接近停滞的情况。1950年美国侵朝战争爆发，加拿大也积极扩张军备。于是它的经济在军事景气刺激下，又开始急剧上升。从1950年到1953年的期间，加拿大的国内投资主要集中在国防工业和战略原料工业方面。这方面最突出的例子就是加拿大飞机制造业的发展。这一工业在1949年还不能侧身于加拿大前四十名最大工业的行列。但是在加拿大政府大规模扩充空军的刺激下，1952年它已升到第十六位，1953年更跃居到第八位。在这种畸形的军事繁荣下，朝鲜战争一结束，加拿大也就自然而然地像美国一样经历了一次经济下降。从1953年到1954年它的工业生产，按年度计算，下跌了3％。但是从1954年下半年起，由于其他资本主义国家正在经历着战后繁荣的阶段，加拿大依靠出口市场，又开始了经济扩张。从1954年下半年到1957年第一季度在加拿大又掀起了一次投资高潮。这次的大规模投资，一方面是用于扩充国防工业，修建机场、公路，设置雷达网，建立一些有军事战略意义的建筑物，同时用于出口工业如木材、造纸和金属开采，以及同这些出口工业关系密切的部门，像水力发电（造纸和制铝工业是水电的最大消费者），燃料、动力和运输设备等工业也进行了扩充。可是1957年第一季度美国经济的停滞，和接着而来的资本主义世界市场繁荣的结束就使加拿大的出口工业出现了严重的生产过剩。此外再加上早就存在的国内市场的萎缩，就使整个工业生产力大大过剩，最后导致了危机的爆发。
    从以上情况可以看出：第一，加拿大战后经济的起伏变化大体上同美国经济的起伏变化极为类似；第二，加拿大的经济在1950年到1953年主要也是依靠军事工业的景气来维持；第三，1954年以后加拿大的经济繁荣是依靠经济进一步军事化和对出口工业的大力扩展来维持。国内市场早已不能容纳战后长期的大规模投资所造成的庞大生产能力。实际上近年来加拿大的国内市场也是借助于消费者信贷的极度扩张来维持的。例如从1951年第三季到1955年第三季加拿大的消费者信贷就从十一亿加元增加到二十二亿多加元。另外去年加拿大国内住房建筑的下降和各种耐用消费品的产量暴跌也是人民购买力下降的明证。例如1957年加拿大除了汽车生产的暴跌以外，冰箱比上一年减产15％，洗衣机减产9％，电视机减产24％，纺织工业减产4％。住房建筑下降了11％……。
    所有这一切都说明，这次加拿大的经济危机是在国内外条件都已成熟的情况下爆发的。
    加拿大政府也像美国政府一样，在去年就采取了像鼓励住房建筑、放松信贷、扩大公共工程、降低加拿大中央银行的再贴现率等措施来延缓危机的发展。此外，它还在去年12月实行了减税。这次减税估计将使加拿大的税收在今年至少损失一亿五千万加元。由于预算的出多进少，加拿大财政部长弗莱明最近说，在1958—1959财政年度将出现六亿四千多万美元的破纪录赤字。
    但是尽管如此，危机却仍然在日益深化。目前从各种迹象看来，加拿大的经济危机已经和美国经济危机合流而急趋下游。这片在北美洲升起的险恶的乌云，正在对西欧造成极大的威胁。
