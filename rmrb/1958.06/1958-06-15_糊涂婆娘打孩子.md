　　Several times I passed through Tongchuan, always hurriedly getting off the train to catch the bus, and getting off the bus to catch the train, without taking the time to look closely. This time, "rainy weather kept me," and I missed the train, spending a whole morning in Tongchuan. So I decided to wander along the road to feast my eyes.
　　Due to industrial development and population increase, Tongchuan has been changed into a city (probably a provincial-level city; the public store signs have changed the "county" character to "city"). But due to the terrain, the city only has one road. Leaning against the mountains and beside the water, from the south gate of the old county town to the south, passing Sanlipu, Wulipu, Qilipu all the way to Shilipu, it is quite long. The road is densely lined with offices and shops, interspersed with some residential houses. Some houses are located on high earthen slopes beside the road. Although the houses are relatively simple, they look like high-rise buildings, and living there is very impressive.
　　In front of such a residence between Wulipu and Qilipu, I happened to see a muddle-headed woman beating her child. A girl of about three years old was watching a small boy who had just learned to walk, playing in front of the house on the earthen slope. Somehow, she wasn't careful, and the little one fell down at the edge of the earthen slope, crying with his head down. The three-year-old older sister grabbed the little brother's leg and exclaimed to her mother for help: "Ah! Ah! Mom, come quickly!"
　　The mother heard the sound and rushed out of the door, with flour on both hands (she was probably kneading dough to make dinner). Seeing this situation, she was so anxious that she scolded the girl for being useless, "can't even look after a child," and slapped her twice on the back of the head. The child was beaten, frightened, and cried, and let go of her hand. The little one who was being pulled by the leg slid down. Fortunately, the earthen slope was not high, and he slid down, so he was not hurt. People passing by quickly ran over, picking up the child and blaming the mother: "This woman is really muddle-headed. If you want to beat the older one, you should pick up the younger one first!"
　　The comment "really muddle-headed" is accurate for this mother, because I don't believe she had any worse intentions. The muddle-headedness lies in the fact that she didn't realize it was wrong at the time, and wasn't as "clear as a bystander" as the passerby. Moreover, she didn't even bother to think about why the child called her over. I think she will understand that she was wrong after she calms down. I don't need to, and don't want to, say anything more to her.
　　From this, I immediately thought of a kind of muddle-headed woman-style critic in our society. Some of them have this kind of frantic emotion, are good at wielding slaps, and when they see something goes wrong, they don't first try to stop the chaos, "pick up the child," but slap them from behind, even if the child is about to slip down, they don't care. It seems that their duty is only to punish mistakes, not to remedy shortcomings. These people don't have very bad intentions; it would be a bit unfair to say that they have ulterior motives, but it would be accurate to say that they are more than capable of spoiling things.
　　However, they are not convinced, and stare and ask, shouldn't mistakes be criticized? The answer is: they should be. But what are you criticizing for? If it is said that the child was not taken care of and fell down, the person who was taking care of the child should be responsible. Then, shouldn't this muddle-headed woman be responsible for the fact that the child finally slipped down? If the critic is a leader, wouldn't this greatly disappoint subordinates?
　　The difference between a good critic and a muddle-headed woman-style critic lies here: the former is good at changing the chaotic situation, first trying to remedy the shortcomings, and also making the responsible person finally understand their mistakes. If it is a general shortcoming, they can always make the person who made the mistake more confident in their work afterward. The latter is always eager to slap people, expanding the chaos and aggravating the negative emotions of the person who made the mistake and those around them. Afterward, they still leave others confused and afraid to take responsibility for things seriously.
　　"One can rouse the spirit, but not deflate it," does not deny positive criticism, and criticism does not necessarily have to be deflating. The problem lies only in what kind of person the critic is and how they are carrying out this criticism. Then, for the muddle-headed woman-style critic, shouldn't "one can rouse the spirit, but not deflate it" be carefully pondered? Besides the spirit and substance, isn't the method also worth learning? Otherwise, can it be dismissed with just a phrase "muddle-headed woman"?

    糊涂婆娘打孩子
    吕秦姬
    几次路过铜川，都是匆匆忙忙的下火车赶汽车，下汽车又赶火车，没有顾得细看一看。这次是“下雨天留客”，误了火车，整整有一个上午耽在铜川，于是我决计沿着马路漫游一番，以饱眼福了。
    铜川由于工业的发展，人口的增加，已经改成了市（大概是省辖市吧，公营商店的招牌上把县“字”都改成“市”字了）。但是由于地势的决定，市区只有一条马路。依山傍水，从旧县城的南门向南，经三里铺、五里铺、七里铺直到十里铺，也还真够长的。马路两旁密密地排列着机关、铺户，也还间有一些居民住宅。有些住宅设在马路旁边高高的土坡上，房子虽较简陋，但看起来也同高楼一样，住着是很风光的。
    就在五里铺和七里铺之间的这样一所住宅前，我偶然地看到了一件糊涂婆娘打孩子的事。一个大约三岁的女孩子，看着一个刚刚会走的小男孩，在土坡上的宅门前玩。不知怎么没有小心，那个小的在土坡边沿上跌倒了，头朝下在那里哭。那位三岁的大姐姐，扯住了小弟弟一条后腿，惊呼她的妈妈前来援救：“啊！啊！妈妈快来呀！”。
    妈妈闻声从房门里闯出来，乍叉着两只面手（她大概正在合面作饭），一看这架势，就急得大骂女孩子没出息，“连个孩子也看不了”，顺手在背后给了两巴掌。孩子一挨打，一受惊，一哭，一撒手，那个被扯着后腿的小的便溜下去了。幸亏是不高的土坡，又是往下溜的，并没有摔坏。路过的人赶快跑过来，一面抱起孩子，一面责怪这位妈妈：“这婆娘真糊涂，你要打大的，也要先把小的抱起来呀”！
    “真糊涂”的评语，对于这位妈妈来说，是确切的，因为我不相信她还有什么更坏的居心。这糊涂就在于她当时并不自觉其为错误，并没有那位过路人那样“旁观者清”，而且，未曾顾得想一下，孩子喊她前来究竟为了什么？我想，她冷静下来以后，也会明白这是自己错了的，对于她，我无需、也不想再说什么了。
    我由此立即想到我们社会上也有这么一种糊涂婆娘式的批评家。他们有的是这种气急败坏的情绪，善于抡巴掌，看到那里出了事，不是先去设法制止混乱，“抱起孩子”，而是从后面一巴掌打下去，即使孩子要溜下去他也是不管不顾的。好像他的职责只在处罚过错，而并不在补救缺点。这种人居心也并不很坏，说他是别有用心，是有些委屈的，但说他是成事不足坏事有余，便算得恰如其分了。
    然而他们又不服气，瞪起眼睛来问道，难道错了就不该批评？答曰：应该的。但你批评又是为了什么呢？如果说孩子没有照顾好，跌倒了应该由看孩子的人负责，那末，后来孩子的终于溜了下去，不是就应该由这位糊涂婆娘负责了吗？批评者倘是领导者，难道这不会使下级大失所望吗？
    好的批评家同糊涂婆娘式的批评家的区别就在这里：前者善于去改变混乱的局面，先设法补救了缺点，同时也使责任者终于明白自己的错处，倘是一般的缺点，他总能使错误者在事后能够更有信心的去工作。而后者总是急于去抡巴掌打人，扩大了混乱，加重了错误者和周围的人的败坏情绪。事后还弄得别人摸不清头脑，而怯于去对事认真负责了。
    “气可鼓而不可泄”，并不否定积极的批评，而批评又不必定是泄气的，问题只在于批评者是那一种人，又是怎样去从事这种批评的。那末，对于糊涂婆娘式的批评家，“气可鼓而不可泄”，不是更应该好好深思咀嚼的吗？除了那精神和实质以外，就连方法不是也值得去学习一番吗？否则，岂是说一句“糊涂婆娘”就能拉倒了呢？
