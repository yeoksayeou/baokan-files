    Cyprus Bloodshed

    Q: What is the story behind the bloody tragedy of the Turkish Cypriot rioters attacking Greek Cypriot residents in Cyprus on June 7th? Reader Cui Zhengbin

    A: Cyprus is a large island at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. It was originally Greek territory and was once ruled by Turkey. It became a British colony in 1878. Of the more than 500,000 residents, 80% are Greek, and Turks account for only a minority. The Greek people have always demanded national self-determination and unification with Greece, and have carried out a long-term struggle. In order to continue ruling this colony, Britain, in addition to bloody suppression, also incited conflicts between the minority Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. The Turkish government has also demanded partition of Cyprus. This bloodshed is related to these conspiracies.

    塞浦路斯流血事件
    问：6月7日塞浦路斯的土耳其族暴徒袭击希腊族居民的流血惨剧，是怎么回事？　读者　崔正彬
    答：塞浦路斯是地中海东端的一个大岛。它原是希腊的领土，曾被土耳其统治过，1878年起成为英国殖民地。在五十多万居民中，80％是希腊人，土耳其人只占少数。希腊族人民一直要求民族自决，归并于希腊，并进行了长期的斗争。英国为了继续统治这块殖民地，除了进行血腥镇压之外，还挑拨少数土耳其族人同希腊族人的冲突。土耳其政府也要求在塞浦路斯实行分治。这次流血事件，就同这些阴谋有关。
