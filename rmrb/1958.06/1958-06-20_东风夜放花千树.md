    The East Wind Blows, A Thousand Trees Bloom
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shang Yin
    Things in the countryside change with unexpected speed. When I arrived in Xinhui on March 10th, the weather was still a bit chilly, the fields lay quietly, and people were busy repairing roads, carrying mud, and delivering manure. But in just over ten days, when I returned to Xinhui from Maoming, I saw a green expanse, newly planted rice seedlings, like a soft velvet carpet covering the fields! What was especially astonishing was that these rice seedlings were arranged in rows that were extraordinarily neat, with uniform symmetry between the fields, so delicate and exquisite, as if in an instant, someone had magically arranged this land.
    "Spring rain is abundant, dyeing a stream with new green." In late March, most parts of Guangdong did indeed have several spring rains, which of course helped the appearance of this poetic landscape. But this is not the main reason. Guangdong has abundant rainfall, and it is common for several heavy rains to fall before Qingming. Why is it that only this year, nearly 30 million mu (over 85% of the total area to be planted in the province) of rice fields were planted in a short period throughout the province; and most of them were planted according to the specifications of close planting, while in previous years, planting had only just begun at this time.
    Moreover, the changes are not limited to rice planting. For example, in afforestation, from March 21st to 23rd, I stayed in Taishan County for three days, and the people of the county were mobilized to carry out a concentrated afforestation effort, aiming to complete a total task of 650,000 to 750,000 mu in these three days, and completing 230,000 mu on the first day. Kaiping, Enping, Yangjiang, Dianbai, Maoming and other counties probably started at the same time, completing a year's work—equivalent to the past few years—in a few days. In these counties, the hills and plains are covered with newly planted cedar, eucalyptus, tea oil trees, stone chestnut, melaleuca, crape myrtle, flamboyant trees...
    And what about water conservancy? The Niyong ditch in Xinhui has suddenly become a river for irrigation, navigation, and fish farming; when I was in Guangzhou, I heard that Maoming County was going to build an irrigation project to irrigate 200,000 mu of land, with a total channel length of more than 170 kilometers, requiring breaking through 15 mountains and 2.67 million cubic meters of earthwork, which would be very difficult for the county to do on its own. But when I entered Maoming County, I saw the Jianjiang River water, like a silver chain, flowing down the newly opened channel! Other fresh things such as eliminating the four pests, vehicle revolution, biogas power generation... and so on, are sometimes simply unbelievable to those who have not experienced them: originally, swarms of flies were competing with people for food, but now it is so clean that not a single one can be seen; originally, people carried things on their backs and shoulders, but now it is replaced by creaking carts; originally, even oil lamps were hard to find, but now it is as bright as day... All of this often appears in a matter of days, how can it not make people feel miraculous?
    What is the reason for such rapid changes in the countryside? Before answering this question, I would like to first describe the relationship between these changes. Things in the countryside are not done in isolation, but are always linked together, with one link tightly connected to another. When one link changes, other links also change accordingly. For example, to strive for a bumper harvest of rice, five barriers must be overcome: water conservancy, fertilizer, technological reform, field management, and careful harvesting and threshing. These five barriers are connected to each other, and a change in one will also lead to a change in another. Du Ruan Township in Xinhui, in order to solve the problem of fertilizer sources, easily achieved vehicle revolution; but after vehicle revolution, the problem of road construction followed. The township Party committee is considering how to flatten the two hills on the highway leading to Jiangmen City to facilitate the passage of bicycles and handcarts. In Conghua County, the transformation started with rice planting. During rice planting, the county Party committee insisted that all rice seedlings in the county should be planted according to the specifications of more than 20,000 plants per mu. But the problem came: what about the fields with insufficient fertilizer and a considerable part of the terraced fields? Should they also be forced to be consistent? This was debated, and the result of the debate was that without violating the farming season, they should all be planted according to the specifications, and efforts should be made to supplement the fertilizer if it was insufficient. This is using a further method to seek balance, or "promoting balance", rather than conservative "promoting regression balance". This is breaking through the technical reform barrier, and then affecting the fertilizer barrier in reverse. This revolution in rice planting technology also affected the reform of labor tools and transportation tools. For example, because of the consistency of row spacing and plant spacing of rice seedlings, the famous "four-row cultivator" was created, and because of the need to send fertilizer up the mountains, a large amount of aerial transportation was used, causing a chain reaction of tool reforms. Therefore, as long as one of these links is broken through, things will run fast like riding a fast horse. But how can we break through one of these links? Like the Conghua County Party Committee, we must have enough courage—enthusiasm, and a determination to promote progress, in order to "strive for the upstream".
    Changes in the countryside also affect the change of leadership plans and strengthen the leadership's determination to leap forward. The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee estimated the current rural situation in late April. It felt that in just two or three months, following the winter planting of 20 million mu, more than 800 million cubic meters of earthwork was used for water conservancy construction, the irrigation area was increased and improved by 12.4 million mu, more than 2 million mu of cultivated land was leveled, and 20 million mu of forest was planted. These are things that could not be done in the past few years or decades. Other aspects such as industry, science and health, culture and education, have also been affected by the leap in agricultural production and have caused changes. The leadership has begun to reconsider the cooperation and coordination of industrial and agricultural production, and paid attention to the new plans regarding rural mechanization and electrification, technological revolution, and cultural revolution.
    What exactly is the reason for such rapid and significant changes in the countryside? It is people, people who are liberated in their thinking. These people dare to think, dare to debate, and dare to act. They not only know "what to do" but also understand "why to do it". This is the result of removing a capitalism and adding a socialism to everyone's mind after the collectivization and the great socialist ideological revolution of last year. Last winter, the issue of more, faster, better, and more economical was also resolved in the great airing of views, great debates. In this way, everyone is like an armed fighter, working with immense strength. Comrade Peng Yaoneng, director of the Longbang No. 1 Cooperative in Xinhui, told me: "Things that have been 'debated' are easy to handle and have momentum. Things that have not been 'debated' are difficult to handle and cannot be done." The early planting and transplanting work of the cooperative was not done well, which affected the entire production arrangement, because the issue of "why plant rice seedlings early?" had not been debated and the thinking had not been unified. The great socialist ideological revolution, the national rectification study, the great airing of views, the great debates, and the big-character posters were the prelude to this great upsurge in production. Wherever we go to any agricultural cooperative, we can see all kinds of big-character posters on the walls of the cooperative committee. When the director of the cooperative talks about production measures, he often says: "This was mentioned in the big-character posters," "It has been debated in the big-character posters, and it will definitely be done." This shows that the flowers of great changes in the countryside had already begun to bud in the great socialist ideological debate. The great harvest on the production front of the whole province is the result of the great liberation of the masses' minds and the flourishing of the masses' wisdom. Socialist thought is like the east wind overnight, blowing a thousand trees and tens of thousands of trees full of flowers.
    The sign of ideological liberation can be attributed to people's belief and determination to conquer nature, that is, whether they dare to win the struggle against nature? Do they succumb to the violence of nature, or conquer and control the entire nature? Of course, this is not enough. Having only belief and determination is not enough to show the state of ideological liberation among cadres and the masses. Because he not only possesses such belief and determination, but also wants to realize such belief and determination quickly! They not only want to turn a backward country into a prosperous and strong country, but also want to catch up with Britain and the most advanced countries in the world in a very short time!
    "Learn from ××, catch up with ××, surpass ××." Such competitive slogans show an extraordinary spirit. Xinhui is an advanced county, and more than 70,000 people have visited it in two months. After these people returned from the visit, they all put forward the slogan of "Learn from Xinhui, catch up with Xinhui, and surpass Xinhui." Others who have visited Hong'an County, Hubei, have also put forward "Learn from Hong'an, catch up with Hong'an, and surpass Hong'an." Large banners are posted everywhere. "What kind of person was Shun? Anyone who strives can also be like him." Such a tone was considered "bragging" in the past. People who have been bound by the idea of "not being the first in the world" for a long time would not think like this, and even if they did, they would not dare to say it publicly. Now it is socialist competition, the so-called "no one should give way in the face of benevolence", and they have also been liberated in their thinking.
    In the countryside, an ordinary farmer will tell you when to mechanize and electrify. He gestures and tells you: "This is a hospital, school, auditorium... this is a fertilizer factory, grain processing factory, oil pressing factory... this is a sports field, theater, club, this is a dairy farm, a bee farm, a silkworm house..." This is not a distant matter, but will be realized in three to five years. I have also heard that they call themselves to become principals, teachers, scientists.... I remember that in 1944, Yan'an held a border area cultural congress, and some farmer representatives called themselves "cultural people", they sang "We are all cultural people", how open and bold it sounds! Not at all restrained. This was more than ten years ago, after the first rectification movement. Now, after another national rectification, a large number of people who call themselves "scientists" and "educators" have emerged. History will prove the reality of these people's heroic voices without discount!
    The Foshan Prefectural Committee put forward a great leap forward slogan: "Turn ten thousand acres of fertile land into granaries, turn water network river gates into fish ponds, turn green barren mountains into fruit mountains, turn thousands of miles of coastline into fishing ports, mulberry and sugarcane base ponds into treasures, electric machinery replace people's labor, turn the countryside into a garden, and make a civilized and prosperous four-no village." What a magnificent spirit this is! This is not an unattainable and distant ideal. I tell you, there is a Xinhui County in Foshan Prefecture, which has begun to gradually realize it. This is the prospect seen from Xinhui County.

    东风夜放花千树
    本报特约记者　尚吟
    农村里的事情，变动得出人意料地快。我在3月10日到新会时，天气还有些儿寒峭，田野静静地躺着，人们忙碌地修路、担泥、送粪。可是还不过十多天的时间，我从茂名再转回到新会来，只见那绿油油的一片，新插上的禾苗，软绒毯似的铺满了田畴！尤其使人惊异的，这些禾苗一行一行的排列得格外整齐，阡陌之间，均匀对称，其细微精致，巧夺天工，仿佛瞬息之间，有谁给这块大地作了魔术样的安排似的。
    “春雨足，染就一溪新绿”。3月下旬，广东的大部地区，确是下了几场春雨，这对面前诗一样的境界的出现，当然不是没有帮助的。但这还不是主要原因。广东雨量充沛，清明之前落下几场大雨，是常有的事。何以唯有今年，一阵子便在全省范围内插下了近三千万亩（占全省应插面积的85％以上）的稻田；而且插得大部分合乎小科密植的规格，往年这个时候，也才不过开始播种。
    而且，事情的变化，还不止插秧这一回事。比如植树造林，3月21日到23日，我住在台山县城的三天，全县人民正动员起来突击造林，要在这三天内完成六十五到七十五万亩的总任务，第一天就完成了二十三万亩。开平、恩平、阳江、电白、茂名等县，大概也是同时动手，在几天之内做完一年——相当于过去几年的工作。在这些县里，漫山遍野的杉树、桉树、茶油、石粟、千层、紫荆、凤凰木……，都是新近才栽上去的。又如水利工作吧。新会的泥涌水沟，忽然变成了灌溉、航行、养鱼三用的河流；在广州的时候，听说茂名县要兴建一项灌溉二十万亩田地的引鉴工程，这项工程渠道全长一百七十多公里，需破开十五座山，二百六十七万个土方工程，由县自己来办是困难很大的。但是当我跨入茂名县境，便看到鉴江的河水，银链似地顺着新开的渠道流泻而来！其他如除四害、车子化、沼气发电……等等许多新鲜事物，不是身历此境的人，有时简直难于置信：原来是窝蜂似的苍蝇和人争食，现在清净得一个也不见了；原来是身背肩挑的，现在代之以咯吱咯吱的车子；原来是油灯也难得找到的，现在是灿烂光明如同白昼；……所有这一切，往往是在几天的时间内出现的，能教人不觉得神奇吗？
    什么原因使得农村起了这样快的变化？回答这个问题之前，我想先记述一下这种变化间的关系。农村里的事情，不是孤立地进行的，总是一个关联一个，一个环节紧扣着另一个环节。其中有一个环节起了变化，其他各个环节也随之起着变化。比如争取水稻的丰收，要过五个关：水利关、肥料关、技术改革关、田间管理关、细收细打关。这五个关就是一个接连一个，其中有一个起变化，也将引起其他一个的变化。新会的杜阮乡，为要解决肥源的问题，很容易就实现了车子化；可是车子化之后，随之而来的便是修筑道路的问题。乡党委正考虑如何把通往江门市的公路上的两个山坡削平，以便利脚踏车和手推车行走。在从化县，变革是从插秧开始的，在插秧时县委坚持了全县的秧苗一律要按两万棵以上的规格插下去。但是问题来了：肥料不足的田和相当部分的梯田怎么办？是否也强求一致？这曾经展开辩论，辩论的结果是不违农时，一律依规格插下去，肥料不足的力求补足追肥。这是用进一步的办法求得平衡，或称“促进的平衡”，而不是保守的“促退的平衡”。这是从突破技术改革关，反转回来再影响到肥料关的。这项插秧技术的革命，同时还影响到劳动工具和运输工具的改革。如因为秧苗株距行距的一致，创制出有名的“四行中耕机”，因为送肥上山的需要，而大量采用空中运输等，引起了一连串工具改革上的连锁反应。所以只要在这一个个的环节中，突破了其中一个，事情就像骑上快马一样迫得飞奔迅跑。可是怎样才能突破这其中的一环呢？要像从化县委那样，有足够的勇气——干劲，要有促进向上的决心，才能“力争上游”。
    农村中的变化，同时影响到领导计划的改变，加强了领导上跃进的决心。广东省委在4月下旬估量了一下目前农村情况。觉得在短短的两三个月内，紧接着进行冬种二千万亩后，修建水利近八亿多土方，增加与改善灌溉面积一千二百四十万亩，平整耕地二百多万亩，植林二千万亩，这是过去几年或几十年所不能做到的事。其他在工业方面、科学卫生、文化教育方面，也受到农业生产的跃进而引起变化，领导上已开始重新考虑工农业生产的配合和协调，注意到关于农村机械化和电气化的问题和技术革命、文化革命等问题的新计划。
    究竟是什么原因使得农村起了这样快这样大的变化呢？这是人，是思想上解放了的人。这些人敢想、敢辩、敢干。他们不但知道“干什么”，而且也懂得“为什么干”。这是合作化之后，经过去年一年的社会主义思想大革命，大伙儿的脑子里去掉了一个资本主义加上了一个社会主义的结果。去年冬天，在大鸣大放大辩中又解决了一个多快好省的问题。这样人人就好像是武装起来的斗士，干起活来力大无比。新会龙榜一社社主任彭耀能同志告诉我：“‘辩’了的事好办，有劲头。不经过‘辩’的事就不好办，搞不下。”该社早播早插工作没做好，影响到整个生产安排，就是对“为什么要提早插秧？”这个问题没有经过辩论，打通思想。社会主义思想大革命，全民的整风学习，大鸣大放大辩大字报，是这次生产大高潮的前奏。我们随便到哪一个农业合作社里去，都可以看到社委会墙上的各式各样的大字报，社主任在谈到生产措施时也常说道：“这在大字报上提过的”，“大字报上辩了，一定能办到”。这说明农村大变化的花朵，早在社会主义思想大辩论中已经开始蓓蕾。全省在生产战线上的大丰收，就是群众思想大解放，群众的智慧之花盛开的结果。社会主义的思想，恰如一夜东风，吹得千株万树繁花满枝。
    思想解放的标志，可以归结到人们对征服自然的信念和决心，即和自然斗争敢不敢胜利？是伏倒于自然的暴力之下，还是征服和驾驭着整个大自然？当然，这还不够，光有信念和决心，还不足以表明现下干部和群众中的思想解放状态。因为他不但具备这样的信念和决心，而且要在很快地实现这样的信念和决心！他们不但要把一个落后的国家变为一个富强的国家，而且要在很短的时间内，赶上英国，赶上世界最先进的国家！
    “学习××，赶上××，超过××”。这样的竞赛口号，显示出一种不平凡的气概。新会是一个先进县，到这里参观的人，两个月内有七万多。这些人参观回去后，都提出了“学习新会，赶上新会，超过新会”的口号。其他到过湖北红安县参观的人，回来后也一样提出“学习红安、赶上红安、超过红安”。大块大块的标语到处张贴着。“舜何人也，有为者亦若是。”这样的口吻，在过去是被认为“大言不惭”的。在长期受“不为天下先”的思想束缚着的人，固然不大会作如是想，就算作如是想也不敢公然地说出来。现在是社会主义竞赛，所谓“当仁不让”，在思想上也就解放起来了。
    在乡下，一个普通的农民，他会对你说什么时候要机械化，电气化。他指手划脚地告诉你：“这是医院、学校、礼堂……这是肥料厂、粮食加工厂、榨油厂……这是运动场、剧场、俱乐部，这是奶牛场、蜜蜂场、蚕房……”这不是很遥远的事，三年到五年的时间就要实现的。我还听说过，他们自称要变成为校长、教员、科学家……。记得1944年，延安开过一次边区文化代表大会，有些农民代表自称为“文化人”，他们歌唱着“我们都是文化人”，说起来是多么的开朗和豪爽啊！一点也不觉得拘束。这是十几年以前的事了，那是在第一次整风运动之后。现在经过了再一次的全民大整风，又出现了一大批自称为“科学家”、“教育家”的人，这些人的豪迈的声音，历史将会不折不扣地证明它的实在性！
    佛山地委提出了一个大跃进的口号：“万顷良田变谷仓，水网河闸变鱼塘，绿化荒山变果山，千里海岸变鱼港，桑蔗基塘成宝地，电气机械代人忙，农村变作花园样，文明富足四无乡。”这是多么雄壮的气魄！这不是一个不可及的、遥远的理想，告诉你，佛山专区有一个新会县，已经开始逐步实现了。这是从新会县看出来的远景啊。
