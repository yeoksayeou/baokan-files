Notes

    The Sorrow of a Slave
    Philippine President Garcia has concluded his visit to the United States. During his visit, in order to win favor with the United States, Garcia reiterated that the Philippines would never recognize China and guaranteed that the Philippines would faithfully fulfill the military treaties signed with the United States, ensuring that American monopoly capital would continue to enjoy privileges in the Philippines.
    What does this "loyalty" of the Philippines to the United States bring? Even Garcia had to admit that the Philippines' "economic situation is far from satisfactory." The trade deficit in 1957 was as high as more than 180 million US dollars, and more than half of it was from American imports.
    Garcia probably thought that by doing his utmost to be obsequious, he could "touch" the "heartstrings" of his American master and thus beg for more dollars. However, Wall Street bosses are never willing to throw more bait to a fish that is already hooked. Therefore, despite Garcia's fawning, he only managed to get a loan of 125 million US dollars. Of which 50 million is still unreliable. And according to reports, the loan he originally hoped to obtain was 300 to 400 million US dollars.
    Selling oneself and relying on others, getting a meager amount of dollars, but ending up with economic bankruptcy, is truly the sorrow of a slave.

### 奴才的悲哀

    奴才的悲哀
    菲律宾总统加西亚已经结束了对美国的访问。在访问期间，加西亚为了博得美国的欢心，曾重申菲律宾决不承认中国，并保证菲律宾将忠实地履行同美国签订的军事条约，保证美国垄断资本在菲律宾继续享有特权。
    菲律宾对美国这样“忠诚”，带来的是什么呢？连加西亚也不得不承认，菲律宾的“经济情况远不是令人满意的”，1957年的贸易逆差高达一亿八千多万美元，而其中一半以上是美国的进口。
    加西亚大概认为，像他这样极尽奴颜婢膝之能事，总该“打动”美国主子的“心弦”，从而多乞求一点美元吧。可是，华尔街老板对于已经上钩的鱼，是决不肯多投诱饵的。因此，尽管加西亚摇尾乞怜，最后却只弄到一亿二千五百万美元的贷款。其中五千万元还不牢靠。而据报道，他原来希望得到的贷款是三亿到四亿美元。
    卖身投靠，仰人鼻息，讨到微薄的一点美元，却弄得经济破产，真可谓奴才的悲哀了。
