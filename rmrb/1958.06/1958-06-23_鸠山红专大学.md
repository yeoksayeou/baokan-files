Jushan Red and Expert University
Xiao Long

Jushan is a high mountain located in Xuegou Township, Yuxian County, Henan Province, estimated to be 800 meters high. On the northern Tianwang Mountain, there is an ancient, dilapidated stockade over a century old. In the old society, this stockade served as a refuge for the common people during times of famine and chaos. The stockade has been abandoned for over forty years, overgrown with weeds, and only thirty-two broken stone caves remain. Water for drinking had to be carried up the mountain from below. Jushan Red and Expert University is located in this high mountain, dilapidated stockade.

The Birth of Jushan Red and Expert University

Jushan has steep slopes and exposed rocks. In the past, during heavy rains, flash floods would occur, causing severe soil erosion. The masses here described the misery of life in the old society, saying: "Living deep in the mountains makes it hard to prosper, and death comes with an empty stomach. If you don't want to suffer, you have to go down the mountain." In 1956, the Party issued a call to develop and build mountainous areas. The people of Yuxian County responded enthusiastically to this call and initially organized twenty-two members of the Communist Youth League to form a youth basic construction team to conquer Jushan. They launched a tenacious struggle against nature and proposed the slogan: "Protecting water and soil is like protecting life; managing mountains and ditches is like managing the home." They were not afraid of the cold weather and overcame all kinds of difficulties to develop and manage fifty-six mountain peaks, achieving "water stays on the mountain, soil stays in the valley, dams don't collapse, and fertile fields don't flood." To commend their achievements, the State Council awarded them a banner of honor. The Provincial People's Committee, Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and County People's Committee also praised them and introduced their experiences.

The new appearance of the mountainous area and the beautiful scenery of the future excited the hearts of the youth of Yuxian County, especially those who were managing the mountainous area. They praised, "The mountainous area is good, every mountain has its treasure." Many young people came to support the construction of the mountainous area and requested to settle down there, expressing their desire to build the area into a beautiful and prosperous place. According to their descriptions, the future mountainous area would be: "Pines and cypresses cover the sun and moon, fruit trees fill the mountains, fish and ducks swim in the ponds, and cattle and sheep graze on the mountains."

In order to develop and build the mountainous area, and to transform the impoverished mountainous area into a prosperous one, the Yuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to train a large number of technicians with proletarian standpoints and viewpoints, mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, and possessing certain specialized scientific and technical knowledge to settle in the mountainous area and build it up. Therefore, the County Committee decided to establish a people-run Red and Expert University in Jushan. The students enrolled in this school were junior and senior high school educated youths with the determination to build the mountainous area. Currently, the school has two classes, one hundred and four students, seven teachers, and three cadres. It opened in mid-March.

The First Lesson

The first lesson for the educated youths who applied to Jushan Red and Expert University was an examination. The examination method of this school has broken with convention. The political course was examined by means of big-character posters. The examination of aspirations was done through heart-to-heart talks. The agricultural course examination involved participating in sowing cotton and deep plowing of autumn fields. The topic for the Chinese language examination was "How to be an ambitious youth." In the political and Chinese language examinations, the students expressed their determination to build the mountainous area. Communist Youth League member Zhang Fengming wrote on a big-character poster: "I want to take root, sprout, blossom and bear fruit in the mountainous area. Party and Chairman Mao, you watch! See how the son you have cultivated and taught is advancing." Communist Youth League member Yan Yongshan said in his composition: "Thousands of difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, cannot defeat my ambition. Thousands of hardships, ten thousand hardships, can never change my determination to build the mountainous area. If I am not red enough, not expert enough, my bones will turn to mud but my soul will not scatter, I will dedicate my life to Tianwang Mountain."

The examination of Jushan Red and Expert University is different from the examination of regular schools. Regular schools only test cultural and scientific knowledge, while they tested the students' political ideology, labor skills, and culture. This examination was actually a political test, a vivid political lesson, testing whether students were determined to build the mountainous area. In fact, during the agricultural course examination, some could not withstand the test of labor, and ten people ran away.

The goal of Jushan Red and Expert University is to train technicians with socialist consciousness who can master scientific knowledge in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and who can also participate in labor. Initially, the length of study was set at two years. In view of the fact that most of the enrolled students were junior high school graduates or dropouts, the length of study was later changed to three years. The courses offered include eight general courses such as politics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, hydrology, meteorology, and surveying, and seventeen specialized courses such as engineering mechanics, soil science and fertilizers, dendrology, silviculture, soil and water conservation, crop cultivation, and crop science. The textbooks used are mainly those from secondary vocational schools, and teachers also use university textbooks as reference materials. They attend classes for two hours every morning, participate in agricultural and sideline labor for nine and a half hours, and participate in social and political activities or self-study in the evenings.

The teachers of this school are all cadres who have been sent down to the countryside. Among the seven people, five are college graduates, one is a student who studied in the Soviet Union and obtained a Ph.D. degree; one is a teacher transferred from the county's No. 1 Middle School. The three cadres were all allocated by the County Committee. They are all full of confidence in running the school well.

Running the School Diligently and Frugally, Combining Work and Study

This school started from scratch, transforming the barren stockade and dilapidated caves into a university. At the beginning of the school year, although the local people enthusiastically supported them, giving them land, furniture, etc., they still encountered many difficulties. The stone caves where the students lived had no doors, there was not a single piece of straw under the sleeping mats, classes were held in the open air, without tables or benches, there were no tools for labor, and water for drinking and washing had to be carried down the mountain.... In the face of these difficulties, the teachers and students did not complain.

On the second day of the school year, all the teachers and students launched a large-scale debate on running the school diligently and frugally and combining work and study, and set off a collective upsurge of running the school and studying diligently and frugally with the slogan "We will build our own school and study ourselves, without spending a penny of the state's money. We will eat by our own labor and use the surplus to support industrialization.‚Äù Their slogan was "Build a new home (i.e. the school) with the support of our old homes, and return the original items when the new home becomes rich." After an hour of discussion, everyone reported a total of 587 pieces of various agricultural tools and household utensils such as hoes, rakes, plows, shovels, and cotton ginning machines, and 103 yuan in cash, as well as over ten shovels and other items, 1,000 brushes and 3,200 sheets of cotton paper as investment in school construction. In this way, the problems they encountered were basically solved.

The school established labor organizations and divided the students into agricultural production teams and sideline production teams; relying on income from agricultural and sideline production to solve students' living and learning expenses, and to build the school. They already have seventy mu of terraced fields and seventy mu of mountain land, with 20,000 fish scale pits. In terms of agricultural production, they have sown 105 mu of sweet potatoes, cotton, corn, millet, potatoes, and vegetables. If there are no special circumstances, the grain crops alone are estimated to yield more than 20,000 jin, and they will be able to achieve complete self-sufficiency in one year. In terms of sideline production, they plan to raise 50 sheep and 50 pigs each, raise 50 silkworm mats, and build two lime kilns. In addition, they also organize students to cut grass and engage in transportation, etc. By the end of the year, the planned income from sideline production is more than 16,000 yuan.

This school has received encouragement and material assistance from the state and various parties. Comrade Diao Wen, Secretary of the County Committee, personally gave them two political lessons. Deputy County Head Tian has made several reports to the school, encouraging them to "have ambition, overcome difficulties, study diligently and deeply, and achieve both redness and expertise." The County Bureau of Culture and Education allocated 1,000 yuan to the school's construction fund, and the bank loaned 1,500 yuan as production expenses. The forestry farm supported them with 15 mu of black locust seedlings and prepaid them 2,000 yuan as a deposit for contracting the seedling field. The county's agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy units also gave the school some support.

The teachers and students of Jushan Red and Expert University will rapidly change its appearance with their laboring hands. According to their plan, the school will look like this one year later:

The campus is fragrant with flowers, the cave walls are whitewashed;
Narrow paths become wide roads, a new large classroom is built.
Every ditch becomes an experimental plot, the mountain caves become grain stores.
Roads are shaded by trees and the mountains are full of fruit, with inexhaustible food and drink.
Strive for complete teaching equipment, clubs, sports fields, electric lights, broadcasting, and libraries.
Clear spring water flows from mountain to mountain, with beautiful flowers and endless joy.
Recruit four or five more classes in the fall. Study politics and technology,
Strive to become both red and expert; both literate and martial, become double champions in three years.

Now, this new type of university with revolutionary spirit is advancing along the correct path under the care and guidance of the Party and the government.
