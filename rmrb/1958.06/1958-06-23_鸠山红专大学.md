Jushan Red and Expert University
Xiao Long

Jushan is a high mountain located in Xuegou Township, Yuxian County, Henan Province, estimated to be 800 meters high. On the northern Tianwang Mountain, there is an ancient, dilapidated stockade over a century old. In the old society, this stockade served as a refuge for the common people during times of famine and chaos. The stockade has been abandoned for over forty years, overgrown with weeds, and only thirty-two broken stone caves remain. Water for drinking had to be carried up the mountain from below. Jushan Red and Expert University is located in this high mountain, dilapidated stockade.

The Birth of Jushan Red and Expert University

Jushan has steep slopes and exposed rocks. In the past, during heavy rains, flash floods would occur, causing severe soil erosion. The masses here described the misery of life in the old society, saying: "Living deep in the mountains makes it hard to prosper, and death comes with an empty stomach. If you don't want to suffer, you have to go down the mountain." In 1956, the Party issued a call to develop and build mountainous areas. The people of Yuxian County responded enthusiastically to this call and initially organized twenty-two members of the Communist Youth League to form a youth basic construction team to conquer Jushan. They launched a tenacious struggle against nature and proposed the slogan: "Protecting water and soil is like protecting life; managing mountains and ditches is like managing the home." They were not afraid of the cold weather and overcame all kinds of difficulties to develop and manage fifty-six mountain peaks, achieving "water stays on the mountain, soil stays in the valley, dams don't collapse, and fertile fields don't flood." To commend their achievements, the State Council awarded them a banner of honor. The Provincial People's Committee, Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and County People's Committee also praised them and introduced their experiences.

The new appearance of the mountainous area and the beautiful scenery of the future excited the hearts of the youth of Yuxian County, especially those who were managing the mountainous area. They praised, "The mountainous area is good, every mountain has its treasure." Many young people came to support the construction of the mountainous area and requested to settle down there, expressing their desire to build the area into a beautiful and prosperous place. According to their descriptions, the future mountainous area would be: "Pines and cypresses cover the sun and moon, fruit trees fill the mountains, fish and ducks swim in the ponds, and cattle and sheep graze on the mountains."

In order to develop and build the mountainous area, and to transform the impoverished mountainous area into a prosperous one, the Yuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to train a large number of technicians with proletarian standpoints and viewpoints, mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, and possessing certain specialized scientific and technical knowledge to settle in the mountainous area and build it up. Therefore, the County Committee decided to establish a people-run Red and Expert University in Jushan. The students enrolled in this school were junior and senior high school educated youths with the determination to build the mountainous area. Currently, the school has two classes, one hundred and four students, seven teachers, and three cadres. It opened in mid-March.

The First Lesson

The first lesson for the educated youths who applied to Jushan Red and Expert University was an examination. The examination method of this school has broken with convention. The political course was examined by means of big-character posters. The examination of aspirations was done through heart-to-heart talks. The agricultural course examination involved participating in sowing cotton and deep plowing of autumn fields. The topic for the Chinese language examination was "How to be an ambitious youth." In the political and Chinese language examinations, the students expressed their determination to build the mountainous area. Communist Youth League member Zhang Fengming wrote on a big-character poster: "I want to take root, sprout, blossom and bear fruit in the mountainous area. Party and Chairman Mao, you watch! See how the son you have cultivated and taught is advancing." Communist Youth League member Yan Yongshan said in his composition: "Thousands of difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, cannot defeat my ambition. Thousands of hardships, ten thousand hardships, can never change my determination to build the mountainous area. If I am not red enough, not expert enough, my bones will turn to mud but my soul will not scatter, I will dedicate my life to Tianwang Mountain."

The examination of Jushan Red and Expert University is different from the examination of regular schools. Regular schools only test cultural and scientific knowledge, while they tested the students' political ideology, labor skills, and culture. This examination was actually a political test, a vivid political lesson, testing whether students were determined to build the mountainous area. In fact, during the agricultural course examination, some could not withstand the test of labor, and ten people ran away.

The goal of Jushan Red and Expert University is to train technicians with socialist consciousness who can master scientific knowledge in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and who can also participate in labor. Initially, the length of study was set at two years. In view of the fact that most of the enrolled students were junior high school graduates or dropouts, the length of study was later changed to three years. The courses offered include eight general courses such as politics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, hydrology, meteorology, and surveying, and seventeen specialized courses such as engineering mechanics, soil science and fertilizers, dendrology, silviculture, soil and water conservation, crop cultivation, and crop science. The textbooks used are mainly those from secondary vocational schools, and teachers also use university textbooks as reference materials. They attend classes for two hours every morning, participate in agricultural and sideline labor for nine and a half hours, and participate in social and political activities or self-study in the evenings.

The teachers of this school are all cadres who have been sent down to the countryside. Among the seven people, five are college graduates, one is a student who studied in the Soviet Union and obtained a Ph.D. degree; one is a teacher transferred from the county's No. 1 Middle School. The three cadres were all allocated by the County Committee. They are all full of confidence in running the school well.

Running the School Diligently and Frugally, Combining Work and Study

This school started from scratch, transforming the barren stockade and dilapidated caves into a university. At the beginning of the school year, although the local people enthusiastically supported them, giving them land, furniture, etc., they still encountered many difficulties. The stone caves where the students lived had no doors, there was not a single piece of straw under the sleeping mats, classes were held in the open air, without tables or benches, there were no tools for labor, and water for drinking and washing had to be carried down the mountain.... In the face of these difficulties, the teachers and students did not complain.

On the second day of the school year, all the teachers and students launched a large-scale debate on running the school diligently and frugally and combining work and study, and set off a collective upsurge of running the school and studying diligently and frugally with the slogan "We will build our own school and study ourselves, without spending a penny of the state's money. We will eat by our own labor and use the surplus to support industrialization.” Their slogan was "Build a new home (i.e. the school) with the support of our old homes, and return the original items when the new home becomes rich." After an hour of discussion, everyone reported a total of 587 pieces of various agricultural tools and household utensils such as hoes, rakes, plows, shovels, and cotton ginning machines, and 103 yuan in cash, as well as over ten shovels and other items, 1,000 brushes and 3,200 sheets of cotton paper as investment in school construction. In this way, the problems they encountered were basically solved.

The school established labor organizations and divided the students into agricultural production teams and sideline production teams; relying on income from agricultural and sideline production to solve students' living and learning expenses, and to build the school. They already have seventy mu of terraced fields and seventy mu of mountain land, with 20,000 fish scale pits. In terms of agricultural production, they have sown 105 mu of sweet potatoes, cotton, corn, millet, potatoes, and vegetables. If there are no special circumstances, the grain crops alone are estimated to yield more than 20,000 jin, and they will be able to achieve complete self-sufficiency in one year. In terms of sideline production, they plan to raise 50 sheep and 50 pigs each, raise 50 silkworm mats, and build two lime kilns. In addition, they also organize students to cut grass and engage in transportation, etc. By the end of the year, the planned income from sideline production is more than 16,000 yuan.

This school has received encouragement and material assistance from the state and various parties. Comrade Diao Wen, Secretary of the County Committee, personally gave them two political lessons. Deputy County Head Tian has made several reports to the school, encouraging them to "have ambition, overcome difficulties, study diligently and deeply, and achieve both redness and expertise." The County Bureau of Culture and Education allocated 1,000 yuan to the school's construction fund, and the bank loaned 1,500 yuan as production expenses. The forestry farm supported them with 15 mu of black locust seedlings and prepaid them 2,000 yuan as a deposit for contracting the seedling field. The county's agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy units also gave the school some support.

The teachers and students of Jushan Red and Expert University will rapidly change its appearance with their laboring hands. According to their plan, the school will look like this one year later:

The campus is fragrant with flowers, the cave walls are whitewashed;
Narrow paths become wide roads, a new large classroom is built.
Every ditch becomes an experimental plot, the mountain caves become grain stores.
Roads are shaded by trees and the mountains are full of fruit, with inexhaustible food and drink.
Strive for complete teaching equipment, clubs, sports fields, electric lights, broadcasting, and libraries.
Clear spring water flows from mountain to mountain, with beautiful flowers and endless joy.
Recruit four or five more classes in the fall. Study politics and technology,
Strive to become both red and expert; both literate and martial, become double champions in three years.

Now, this new type of university with revolutionary spirit is advancing along the correct path under the care and guidance of the Party and the government.

    鸠山红专大学
    萧龙
    鸠山是河南省禹县薛沟乡境内的一座高山，估计高达八百公尺。北面天王山上有一个一百多年的古老的破寨，这个寨子在旧社会是老百姓在荒乱的年月里逃难藏身的场所。山寨已经荒芜了四十多年，野草丛生，原来的山寨仅有三十二个破石洞。山上吃的水要到山下去担。鸠山红专大学就设在这高山破寨里。
    鸠山红专大学的诞生
    鸠山山高坡陡，岩石裸露，过去每逢大雨，山洪暴发，水土流失严重。这里的群众形容在旧社会的生活惨状说：“久居深山难富裕，临死还是肚内饥，要想不受苦，除非下山去。”1956年党发出了开发山区、建设山区的号召。禹县人民热烈响应党的这个号召，首批组织二十二名共青团员成立一支征服鸠山的青年基本建设队，他们向自然展开了顽强的斗争，他们提出“保水保土如保命，治山治沟如治家”的口号，他们不怕天寒地冻，克服种种困难，开发治理好五十六个山头，做到“水不下山，土不出川，堰不倒塌，良田不淹。”为了表彰他们的功绩，国务院曾授予他们一面奖旗，省人民委员会、许昌专署、县人民委员会也表扬了他们，并介绍了他们的经验。
    新的山区的面貌和未来的美景激动着禹县青年的心，特别是治理山区的青年的心，他们称赞“山区就是好，十山有十宝。”许多青年纷纷支援山区建设，并要求在山区安家落户，他们表示要把山区建设成为一个美丽富饶的山区，照他们的描画，未来的山区是“松柏遮日月，花果树满山，鱼鸭池中游，牛羊牧山间。”
    为了开发山区、建设山区，把贫困的山区变为富裕的山区，中共禹县县委会决定要培养大批具有无产阶级立场、观点，掌握马列主义理论，又有一定专门科学技术知识的技术人员在山区安家落户，建设山区。因此，县委决定在鸠山创办一座民办性质的红专大学。这所学校招收的学生就是具有建设山区决心的初中、高中的知识青年。现在这所学校有两个班，一百零四名学生，七名教师，三名干部。它已于3月中旬开学。
    第一课
    报考鸠山红专大学的知识青年所上的第一课是考试。这所学校的考试方法已打破常规。考政治课采用大字报的方式，考志愿采取谈心会的方式，考农业课是参加播种棉花、深翻大秋地的劳动，考试语文的题目是“怎样做一个有志气的青年”。在政治课和语文的考试中，学员表示建设山区的决心。共青团员张凤鸣在大字报上写道：“我要钻到山区里生根发芽、开花结果，党和毛主席您看吧！看您培养教导下的儿子是怎样的前进。”共青团员阎永善在作文中说：“千难万难，难不倒我的志愿，千苦万苦，绝不能把我建设山区的决心改变，红不透，专不深，骨肉成泥魂不散，把生命献在天王山上。”
    鸠山红专大学的考试不同一般正规学校的考试。正规学校只考试文化科学知识，而他们把学生的政治思想、劳动、文化都考试了一下。这场考试实际上是一场政治考验，是一场生动的政治课，考验学生是否有决心建设山区。事实上，在农业课的考试当中，有的经不起劳动的考验，有十个人逃之夭夭了。
    鸠山红专大学培养的目标是有社会主义觉悟、能掌握农业、林业、水利三方面科学知识而又能参加劳动的技术员。最初修业年限定为二年，鉴于招收学生大部分是初中毕业或肄业生，后来把修业年限改为三年。他们所开课程，普通课有政治、数学、物理、化学、植物、水文、气象、测量学等八门，专业课有工程力学、土壤肥料学、树木学、造林学、水土保持、耕作学及作物栽培学等十七门。他们所采用的教材主要是中等专业学校的课本，教师也用高等学校教材作为参考。每天早上上课两小时，参加农副业劳动九个半小时，晚上参加社会、政治活动或自习。
    这所学校的教师都是下放的干部，七个人当中有五个大专毕业生，一个是留苏联学生并得过副博士学位；一个是从该县第一中学抽调的教员。三个干部都是县委调配的。他们都满怀信心的要把学校办好。
    勤俭办学  勤工俭学
    这所学校是白手起家，把荒寨破洞变成大学的。开学初，虽然当地群众热情的支持他们，给他们地、家具等，但他们仍然遇到不少困难，学生住的石洞没有门，睡铺底下没有一根草，在露天里上课，也没有桌、凳，劳动没有工具，吃水、洗脸都跑到山下去……。在这些困难面前，师生没一句怨言。
    开学第二天，全校师生展开勤俭办学、勤工俭学的大辩论，并掀起了一个“自己办学自己学，不要国家一文钱，自己劳动自己吃，剩余支援工业化”的集体办学、勤俭办学的热潮。他们的口号是“建新家（即学校）老家支援，新家富原物归还。”经过一小时的讨论，大家共报了锄、耙、犁、铲子、弹花机等各种农具和生活用具五百八十七件，现金一百零三元，共青团员刘洪克自报锨铲十多件，毛笔一千支，棉纸三千二百张，作为建校投资。这样，他们遇到的问题就基本上解决了。
    学校建立了劳动组织，把学生分别编入农业生产队和副业生产队；依靠从事农副业生产收入解决学生的生活和学习费用，并建设学校。他们已有七十亩梯田和七十亩山头地，有二万个鱼鳞坑。在农业生产方面，他们已播种有红薯、棉花、玉米、谷子、马铃薯、蔬菜等一百零五亩，如果没有特殊情况，仅粮食作物估计可收入二万多斤，一年就能达到全部自给自足。在副业生产方面，计划养羊、猪各五十头，养蚕五十席，建石灰窑两座，此外，还组织学生割草、搞运输等，到年底副业生产收入计划是一万六千多元。
    这所学校得到国家和各方面的鼓励和物资帮助。该县县委书记刁文同志亲自给他们讲过两次政治课，田副县长曾几次到学校作报告，鼓励他们“要长志气，克服困难，苦学苦钻，达到红透专深。”县文教局拨给该校一千元建校基金，银行贷款一千五百元作为生产费用，林场支援他们洋槐育苗十五亩，并预先支付给他们二千元承包育苗田的订金，县农、林、水利等单位也给学校一些支援。
    鸠山红专大学的师生们将以劳动的双手迅速地改变它的面貌。照他们的规划，一年之后，这所学校的模样将是这样的：
    校园百花香，洞洞粉白墙；
    羊肠小道变大路，新建一所大课堂。
    沟沟变成试验地，山洞变成粮食仓。
    道路成荫果满山，吃喝不尽用不完。
    教学设备争取全，俱乐部、体育场、电灯、广播、图书馆。
    清泉流水山连山，百花艳、乐无边。
    秋后再招四五班。学习政治技术钻，
    锻炼成为红又专；既能文又能武，三年后成为双状元。
    现在，这所具有革命精神的新型大学，正在党和政府的关怀指导之下，沿着正确的道路前进。
