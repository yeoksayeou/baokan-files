    The Power of the Master of Nature
    Can agricultural production develop at high speed? What is the great significance of human subjective initiative? After reading the news items published today, can't we draw a conclusion?
    Some people suffering from right-leaning symptoms did not learn their lesson during the Great Leap Forward last winter and this spring, saying that they would "settle accounts with you after autumn." Now, it is not yet time to settle the final account after autumn, but the first account can be settled, and they are destined to lose. We hope that these comrades will admit defeat early and stop standing by and gesticulating. By admitting defeat, they can recognize the great power of revolutionary peasants and join everyone in invigorating their spirits and working hard.
    Some people who are content to be slaves of nature always like to emphasize how bad the objective conditions are! How hopeless! Therefore, while others are striving to go upstream, they are content to stay in the middle, or even willingly go downstream. These comrades should also learn some experience now. It turns out that bad conditions can be changed. The question is: to have the ambition to be the master of nature, to truly understand that "everything is done by man, and the subjective initiative of the masses is a great driving force."

    自然主宰者的威力
    农业生产能不能高速度发展？人的主观能动性有什么巨大意义？读了今天发表的几条消息，难道还不能得出结论吗？
    有一些害了右倾病症的人，在去冬今春大跃进中还没有得到教训，说是要“到秋后再同你们算账”。现在，还没有到秋后算总账的时候，但是第一次账是可以算了，而且他们已经注定算输了。我们希望这些同志提早认输吧，不要再站在旁边指手划脚了。认了输，就可以认识到革命的农民的伟大威力，就可以同大家一起，振作精神，鼓足干劲。
    有一些安于做自然的奴隶的人，总是喜欢强调客观条件怎样不好呀！怎样没有办法呀！因此，人家在力争上游，他却安居中游，或者自甘下游。这些同志现在也该学到一点经验了。原来，不好的条件是可以改变的。问题是在于：要有志气做大自然的主宰者，要真正懂得“事在人为，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力”。
