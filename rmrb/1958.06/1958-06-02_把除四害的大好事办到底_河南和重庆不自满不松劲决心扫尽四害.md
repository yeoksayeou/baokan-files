　　Henan and Chongqing, Not Complacent or Relaxed, Determined to Sweep Away All Pests

　　(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Henan Daily: The Henan Province’s movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene is developing towards a new stage.

　　Since the end of last year, after several months of continuous concentrated efforts by the people of Henan, significant achievements have been made in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. Since this spring, the incidence of seasonal infectious diseases in various regions has decreased significantly. For example, the incidence of dysentery in the province during the spring was 16% lower than in the same period last year; in Dengfeng County, the incidence of malaria and gastrointestinal diseases this year decreased by more than 90% compared to the same period in 1955.

　　Currently, various regions are conducting comprehensive inspections of the previous stage of work, summarizing experiences, formulating plans, and launching new battles. In summarizing and inspecting, the Luoyang Special District found that many cadres and masses had a relaxed attitude of "taking a break," and promptly put forward the new battle slogan of "no complacency, no relaxation, thoroughly eliminate the remaining four pests." The Xinxiang Special District adopted the method of "raising the level of the first category, grasping the second category, and sitting to help the third category" to strive for a complete victory in the battle to eliminate the four pests. In the Xinyang Special District, various regions are closely integrating with production, taking comprehensive measures to vigorously eliminate the remaining four pests and continue to carry out basic hygiene construction. Zhengzhou City is vigorously annihilating the remaining four pests, while further improving the finishing work of basic hygiene construction; universally mobilizing the masses to formulate covenants for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene; strictly implementing the hygiene area responsibility system, promoting hygiene supervision; and conducting regular major offensives, major inspections, and major appraisals.

　　(Reported by this newspaper reporter Gong Chenghua) Chongqing City recently organized the masses to conduct a major debate on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, promptly overcoming the relaxed thinking that arose among a few people after the large-scale offensive, in order to push the movement further forward.

　　After a large-scale offensive movement to eliminate the four pests in Chongqing City, a "sense of security" and relaxed thinking grew among a few people. In response to this situation, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly put forward the task to the masses of eliminating pests completely and to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene regularly and more deeply. At the same time, the residents of the city were organized to debate two issues: the harm of the four pests to the people and socialist construction, and how to completely eliminate the four pests. In the debate, the masses, from their own personal experiences, realized the benefits after the elimination of the four pests, recognized that this was a great thing, and demanded that the good thing be carried out to the end. In the debates among residents of various districts and rural areas, the broad masses believed that the achievements of this offensive movement were great, but there were still remnants, especially since the four pests breed quickly, so there could be no complacency or relaxation, otherwise previous efforts would be abandoned.

　　On the basis of ideological improvement, the masses automatically formulated various systems, turning the elimination of the four pests and the promotion of hygiene into a regular mass activity, and a wave of households automatically formulating patriotic hygiene covenants appeared. They pledged to achieve "four no's" (no spitting, no dumping garbage, no urinating or defecating, no littering of melon and fruit peels and paper scraps); "eight cleans" (clean indoors and outdoors, clean courtyards, clean eating utensils, clean personal hygiene, clean streets and alleys, clean public places, clean bedding, clean clothes). Citizens also specifically divided the cleaning and hygiene responsibility areas for each household, cleaning once or twice a day, and conducting a major cleaning once a week. Mutual aid groups were also established in residents' groups to supervise and help residents who were busy with production to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene. Various streets have also formulated inspection and appraisal systems for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

　　The Chongqing City Headquarters for Eliminating the Four Pests also took specific measures to deal with the disposal of urban feces; the sewage waterfalls and sewage ditches were also cleaned up. The Shanhuba sewage pond, which has accumulated water for more than 300 years and covers an area of 200,000 square meters, is a major breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies. After 300,000 person-times of voluntary labor, it has been dredged and connected to the Yangtze River, turning the stinky sewage in the pond into flowing clear water.

### 把除四害的大好事办到底  河南和重庆不自满不松劲决心扫尽四害

　　把除四害的大好事办到底
    河南和重庆不自满不松劲决心扫尽四害
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：河南省除四害讲卫生运动正向新的阶段发展。
    去年年底以来河南人民经过几个月的连续突击，除四害讲卫生运动取得了很大的成绩。今春以来，各地的季节性传染病显著减少，如春季全省痢疾的发病率比去年同期下降16％；登封县今年的疟疾、肠胃病的发病率与1955年同期相比下降90％以上。
    目前，各地正在普遍检查前一阶段的工作，总结经验，制定计划，开展新的战斗。洛阳专区在总结检查中，发现不少干部、群众有“歇一歇”的松劲情绪，便及时提出“不自满、不松劲，彻底消灭四害残余”的新的战斗口号。新乡专区采用“提高一类，抓好二类，坐阵帮助三类”的办法，争取除四害战斗获得彻底胜利。信阳专区各地正密切结合生产，采取综合措施，大力扑灭残存四害和继续进行卫生基本建设。郑州全市人民在大力歼灭残余四害的同时，进一步搞好卫生基本建设的扫尾工作；并普遍发动群众订立除四害讲卫生公约；严格执行卫生区域责任制，推行卫生监督；定期进行大突击、大检查、大评比。
    本报讯　记者龚成华报道：重庆市最近组织群众进行了一场除四害、讲卫生的大辩论，及时克服在大规模突击后少数人中产生的松劲思想，以便把运动向前推进一步。
    重庆市经过大规模除四害的突击运动后，在少数群众中滋长出“高枕无忧”和松劲思想。针对这种情况，中共重庆市委向群众及时提出除害务尽，必须经常地、更深入地开展除四害、讲卫生运动的任务。同时组织全市居民辩论四害对人民和社会主义建设的危害，和如何彻底消灭四害两个问题。在辩论中，群众从亲身体会到消灭四害以后的好处，认识到这是一件大好事，要求把好事办到底。在各区居民和农村的辩论中，广大群众认为这次突击运动的成绩很大，但是还有残余，尤其四害繁殖得快，因此不能自满、松劲，不然就要前功尽弃。
    在思想提高的基础上，群众自动订立了各种制度，把除四害、讲卫生变成一种经常性的群众活动，出现各家各户自动订立爱国卫生公约的热潮。他们保证做到“四不”（不随地吐痰、不随地倒垃圾、不随地大小便、不随地乱抛瓜果皮和纸屑）；“八净”（室内外干净、院落干净、食具干净、个人身体干净、大街小巷干净、公共场所干净、被褥干净、衣服干净）。市民们又具体划分各家清洁卫生责任区域，每天清扫一至两次，每周大扫除一次。在居民小组中还成立了互助小组，互相监督和帮助生产忙的居民搞好清洁卫生。各街道还订出了除四害、讲卫生的检查、评比制度。
    重庆市除四害指挥部还对城区粪便的处理采取了具体措施；对污水瀑布和污水沟渠，也作了清理。积水已有三百多年、面积达二十万平方公尺的珊湖坝污水塘，是蚊蝇孳生的大本营，经过三十万人次的义务劳动，加以疏导，已经使它与长江相通，把塘里的臭污水变为流动的清水。
