Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: The general line of socialist construction has greatly encouraged the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian Province to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

The returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in Jinjiang County, a major hometown of overseas Chinese, after reading the news and documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, happily spread the word, saying: The powerful motherland with modern industry and agriculture that our overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese compatriots have longed for for generations is about to be realized faster and faster. They have expressed their willingness to contribute money and effort, and use practical actions to build socialist hometowns and the motherland in a faster, better, and more economical way. In the past few days, the returned overseas Chinese, their relatives, and the local people of this county have invested 7.38 million yuan in succession to run local small-scale industries. At the same time, they have collected 1.5 million jin of scrap copper and iron to supply the needs of local industrial development. Wu Wushang, a returned overseas Chinese in Luoshan Township, specially dismantled an iron-made patio cover weighing more than 3,000 jin, which was built before liberation to prevent bandits, and sold it to the supply and marketing cooperative, and invested the money earned in the township to run industries. He said: "Before liberation, the people in our overseas Chinese hometowns lived in misery, and bandits were rampant, so we built patio covers everywhere; now the overseas Chinese hometowns are peaceful and prosperous everywhere. We must, under the encouragement of the general line, make factories bloom everywhere in the overseas Chinese hometowns."

Chen Yangzeng, director of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Investment Company Office and returned overseas Chinese, told reporters: "Our investment company has decided to invest 60% more funds than last year to participate in local industrial construction."

    总路线传到福建侨乡
    归侨和侨眷投资建设的热情更高涨
    据新华社福州讯　社会主义建设总路线大大鼓舞了福建省广大归国华侨和侨眷参加祖国社会主义建设的热情。
    主要华侨家乡晋江县的广大归侨和侨眷，在看了中共八大二次会议的消息和文件以后，欢欣鼓舞地奔走相告说：我们归侨和海外侨胞祖辈盼望的有现代工业和农业的强大祖国，现在愈来愈快就要实现了。他们纷纷表示要有钱出钱、有力出力，用实际行动多快好省地建设社会主义的家乡和祖国。在最近几天内，这个县的归侨、侨眷和当地人民一起，先后投资七百三十八万元兴办地方小型工业，同时收集了一百五十万斤废铜废铁，供应发展地方工业的需要。罗山乡归侨吴乌赏特地把解放前为了防避土匪而打造的一副三千多斤重的铁制天井盖，拆下来卖给供销社，并把卖得的钱向乡里投资办工业。他说：“解放前，我们侨乡民不聊生，土匪乱如麻，到处修天井盖；现在的侨乡到处安居乐业，我们一定在总路线的鼓舞下，使工厂在侨乡遍地开花。”
    福建省华侨投资公司办公室主任、归侨陈仰曾对记者说：“我们投资公司已决定比去年多投60％的资金，参加地方工业建设。”
