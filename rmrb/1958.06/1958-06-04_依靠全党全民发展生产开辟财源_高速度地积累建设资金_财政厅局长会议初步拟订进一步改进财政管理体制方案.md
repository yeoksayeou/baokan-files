Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The National Conference of Provincial and Municipal Finance Directors, recently convened by the Ministry of Finance, pointed out that, in accordance with the general line of socialist construction, the basic task of financial work in the future is to accumulate construction funds at high speed, and to use construction funds rationally and thriftily, in order to fully support the great leap forward in production and construction. The key to completing this task lies in relying on the entire Party and relying on the masses to manage finance.

　　This conference was held from April 28th to May 31st. The conference implemented the spirit of first focusing on ideology, then on practical matters, and combining ideology and practice. During the ideological discussions, the attending representatives all used the general line of socialist construction as the standard to earnestly examine the shortcomings of past financial work, and also discussed several important issues in future financial work. The conference believed that in order for financial work to implement the general line of socialist construction, it is necessary to thoroughly liberate thought, boldly mobilize the masses, and make every effort to accumulate funds at high speed on the basis of the great leap forward in production, in order to ensure the high-speed development of socialist construction. In the past, some comrades engaged in financial work did not have a sufficient understanding of this point. In their work, they often considered the balance of financial revenue and expenditure too much, and sometimes adopted some passive and mechanical balancing methods, paying insufficient attention to how to open up financial resources from the development of production. The conference believed that it is necessary to open up financial resources from the development of production, and to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift through strict economy, in order to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.

　　The conference pointed out that completing the task of accumulating construction funds at high speed cannot be done solely by a few staff members of the financial system. It is necessary to rely on the entire Party and rely on the masses to manage finance. Because China's finance is based on the public ownership of the means of production, it is socialist finance, people's finance, and every receipt and expenditure in finance is directly or indirectly related to the immediate and long-term interests of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, financial work is by no means a technical job, but a political job and a mass work. It is necessary to rely on the entire Party and rely on the masses to manage finance in order to do financial work well. In the past, some comrades engaged in financial work did not have a sufficient understanding of this point either. They excessively exaggerated the role of rules and regulations, and one-sidedly emphasized financial supervision, while neglecting the role of people and the supervision of the masses. This prevented financial work from playing its due role.

　　The conference believed that in order to rely on the entire Party and rely on the masses to manage finance, it is necessary to adopt a series of specific measures, among which resolving the relationship between centralism and decentralization in the financial management system is an important link in relying on the entire Party to do a good job in finance. Since the State Council promulgated the regulations on improving the financial management system on November 15 last year, and began to implement them this year, it has achieved good results, and the enthusiasm of various localities and departments has also been brought into play, and it has powerfully supported the great leap forward in production and construction. However, according to the current new situation, there is still a need for further improvement. On the one hand, the conference made appropriate adjustments to some unreasonable parts in the past calculation of the income and expenditure base numbers of various regions; on the other hand, according to the general line of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and the spirit that financial powers should be delegated sufficiently when they should be delegated, and that financial systems should be simplified as much as possible when they can be simplified, it has preliminarily drafted a plan for further improving the financial management system, and will submit it to various localities for continued study.

　　The conference also reformed various rules and regulations that fettered the productive forces and were not conducive to bringing into play the enthusiasm of the masses with a revolutionary spirit. In the reform of these rules and regulations, some of the powers to formulate systems were delegated to the local level. For example, for budget forms and expenditure standards, except for those that must still be uniformly stipulated by the central government, the rest are handed over to the local level to formulate according to local conditions; at the same time, the system procedures have also been greatly simplified. For example, the reports submitted by provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to the central government have eliminated quarterly reports and simplified monthly reports, which can reduce 96% of the workload. The number of budget forms has been simplified from the original sixty to ten, and the number of indicators to be filled in has been reduced from about 20,000 to about 3,000.

　　This conference also discussed the decentralization of management power of insurance work and the power of financial allocation for capital construction, as well as several issues in industrial and commercial tax revenue. The conference also studied the leap forward targets for financial revenue and expenditure in 1958 according to the new situation of the national great leap forward in production. The representatives from various localities expressed with full confidence that they are not only confident of completing the national budget adopted by the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February this year, but also can greatly overfulfill it.

　　依靠全党全民发展生产开辟财源
    高速度地积累建设资金
    财政厅局长会议初步拟订进一步改进财政管理体制方案
    财政政策的好坏固然足以影响经济，但是决定财政的却是经济。未有经济无基础而可以解决财政困难的，未有经济不发展而可以使财政充裕的。 　　 ——毛泽东：抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题
    新华社3日讯  财政部最近召开的全国财政厅局长会议指出，根据社会主义建设的总路线，今后财政工作的基本任务就是要高速度地积累建设资金，合理地和节约地使用建设资金，以全力支持生产建设的大跃进。完成这一任务的关键，在于依靠全党、依靠群众来办财政。
    这次会议是从4月28日到5月31日举行的。会议贯彻了先务虚后务实、虚实并举的精神。在务虚时，到会代表都以社会主义建设的总路线为标准，认真地检查了过去财政工作中的缺点，同时也讨论了今后财政工作中的若干重要问题。会议认为财政工作要贯彻社会主义建设的总路线，必须彻底解放思想，放手发动群众，千方百计地在生产大跃进的基础上，高速度地积累资金，以保证社会主义建设的高速度的发展。过去有一些做财政工作的同志对这一点是认识不足的，他们在工作中往往是考虑财政收支数字平衡多，并且有时采取了一些消极的、机械的平衡办法，对于如何从发展生产来开辟财源则注意不够。会议认为，必须从发展生产来开辟财源，从厉行节约来贯彻勤俭建国的方针才能多快好省地建设社会主义。
    会议指出，要完成高速度积累建设资金的任务，绝不是财政系统少数工作人员就能做好的，必须依靠全党、依靠群众来办财政。由于我国的财政是以生产资料公有制为基础的，是社会主义的财政，人民的财政，财政上的一收一支都直接或间接地关系到广大人民的眼前利益和长远利益。因此，财政工作绝不是什么技术性的工作，而是一种政治工作和群众工作，必须依靠全党、依靠群众办财政才能把财政工作做好。过去有些做财政工作的同志对于这一点也是认识不足的，他们过分夸大了规章制度的作用，并且片面地强调了财政监督，而忽视了人的作用和群众的监督。这样就使财政工作不能发挥应有的作用。
    会议认为，要依靠全党、依靠群众来办财政，就必须采取一系列的具体措施，其中解决财政管理体制上的中央集权与地方分权的关系问题，是依靠全党办好财政工作的重要一环。去年11月15日国务院公布了关于改进财政管理体制的规定并在今年开始实行以来，已经收到了良好的效果，各地方、各部门的积极性亦有所发挥，并且有力地支持了生产建设的大跃进。但是根据目前的新情况，还有进一步改进的必要。会议一方面对于过去计算各地区的收入与支出基数中的某些不合理部分作了适当的调整；另一方面根据多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，和财政权限上应当下放的要放够，财政制度上能够简便的要尽量简便的精神，初步拟订了进一步改进财政管理体制的方案，并将提交各地继续进行研究。
    会议还以革命的精神，大刀阔斧地改革了各种束缚生产力和不利于发挥群众积极性的规章制度。在这些规章制度的改革中，一部分是把制订制度的权限下放给地方。如对预算表格及经费开支标准等问题，除了必须仍由中央统一规定的以外，其余都交由地方根据各地实际情况因地制宜地自行规定；同时也大大简化了制度手续。如省、市、自治区向中央报送的报表，就取消了季报、简化了月报，这样就可以减少96％的工作量。预算表格由原来的六十种简化成十种，填写的指标由二万个左右，减少到约三千个。
    这次会议还讨论了保险工作管理权力和基本建设财务拨款工作权力下放及工商税收中若干问题。会议还根据全国生产大跃进的新情况，研究了1958年财政收支的跃进指标，各地代表都满怀信心地表示，对今年2月第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议所通过的国家预算不但有把握完成，而且可以大大地超额完成。
