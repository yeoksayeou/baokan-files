    Shandong Has Collected 50,000 Folk Songs
    Twenty Volumes of Folk Song Selections Will Be Published
    (Our dispatch) Since the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice in mid-April to collect folk songs, the entire province had collected 50,000 folk songs by the end of May. In order to strengthen the work of sorting out and researching folk songs, under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shandong Folk Song Editorial Group was formed by drawing a group of editors from the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Cultural Bureau, the Shandong People's Publishing House, and the Dazhong Daily. Now, this group has initially selected, edited, and classified some of the materials. After a few days of intensive work, the first batch of more than a thousand folk songs has been compiled into a collection, and it is expected that twenty volumes of folk song selections will be published soon. Among them, in addition to reflecting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, there will also be one reflecting the life and struggle of fishermen and salt workers. The creators of these folk songs are mostly workers and peasants, who describe the heroic steps and magnificent spirit of the working people of Shandong in the socialist great leap forward with a bright tone of socialist realism and revolutionary romanticism. One of them wrote: "The Great Wall was built by the people, the Grand Canal was opened by the people. Since ancient times, China has had many heroes, but today's heroes surpass hundreds of generations. Raise your hands to push down the mountains, and drop your hands to fill the vast sea." Another one is: "A small cart squeaks, I push stones to build river dams, don't look at my cart is small, even Mount Tai can be loaded."
    Under the leadership of the Party committees of various counties and cities, the activity of collecting and sorting out folk songs has been launched in vast areas of Shandong Province. At present, more than twenty counties and cities have published collections of folk songs.

    山东已搜集民歌五万
    二十本民歌选将出版
    本报讯　自中共山东省委4月中旬发出搜集民歌的通知后，到5月底止，全省已搜集民歌五万首。为加强民歌的整理研究工作，在中共山东省委宣传部的领导下，由省文联、文化局、山东人民出版社、大众日报社等单位抽调一部分编辑人员组成了山东省民歌编辑组。现在，这个组已经将部分材料进行了初选、编辑和分类。经过最近几天的突击，首批千余首民歌已汇编成集，预计最近将有二十本民歌选集出版。其中除了反映工、农业生产大跃进的以外，还有一本是反映渔民、盐民生活和斗争的。这些民歌的创作者绝大部分是工农群众，他们以社会主义现实主义和革命浪漫主义的明朗笔调，描绘了山东劳动人民在社会主义大跃进中的豪迈步伐和磅礴气概。其中有一首写道：“万里长城人民建，千里运河人民开。自古中国英雄多，今朝英雄胜百代。举手推倒重重山，落手填平茫茫海”。另一首是：“一辆小车吱呀呀，我推石头修河坝，别看我的车子小，泰山也能装得下”。
    在各县、市党委的领导下，搜集与整理民歌的活动已在山东省广大地区展开。目前有二十多个县、市出版了民歌集。
