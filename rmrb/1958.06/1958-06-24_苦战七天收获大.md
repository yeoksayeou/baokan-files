    Great Harvest After Seven Days of Hard Work
    In late May, our company only completed 50% of the monthly construction plan. At this time, the company's Party committee conveyed the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of all our employees. After seven days of hard work, we overfulfilled the May construction plan by 3.8%.
    In just seven days, many heroic figures emerged, and examples of technological innovation, creation of machinery, and improvement of tools came one after another. Comrade Na Zhiqiang, a technician from the First Engineering Section, created a double-acting rammer, which replaced manual ramming and doubled efficiency. Workers in the prefabrication plant improved their operating methods, increasing production from thirty precast panels per day to one hundred and thirteen. Zhou Jingrong, a young electrician from the Second Engineering Section, and the engineering and technical personnel and workers from the Third Engineering Section, as well as the plumbing team of Feng Junliang from the Fourth Engineering Section, created and improved tools, greatly improving work efficiency.
    Now, all our employees are continuing to advance on the basis of victory. Everyone is full of confidence in guaranteeing the overfulfillment of the second quarter's construction plan, and plans to achieve 15,000 technical innovations in June as a gift for the Party's birthday – "July 1st."

    苦战七天收获大
    5月下旬，我们公司只完成了月施工计划的50％，这时，公司党委传达了党的建设社会主义的总路线，激起我们全体职工的革命干劲，经过七天苦战，以超额3.8％完成5月份的施工计划。
    在短短的七天内，涌现出很多英雄人物，革新技术、创造机械和改进工具的事例一个接着一个。第一工段技术员那治强同志创造了双动打夯机，代替了手工打夯，提高效率一倍。预制厂工人改进了操作方法，由每天打三十块预制板，提高到一百一十三块。第二工段青年电工周景荣和第三工段工程技术人员和工人、第四工段水暖工冯俊良小组等创造和改进了工具，工作效率大大提高。
    现在，我们全体职工正在胜利的基础上继续前进，人人都信心百倍保证超额完成第二季度的施工计划，并要在6月份实现技术革新一万五千件，为党的生日——“七一”献礼。 		 太原第一建筑公司  赵辅臣
