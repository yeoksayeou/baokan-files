Xinhua News Agency, Nantong, June 10th. The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the China Construction Trade Union held an on-site meeting in Nantong City from June 2nd to 9th. The purpose of this meeting was to further summarize and promote Nantong's experience and exchange advanced experiences from various regions, in order to adapt to the new situation of industrial construction faced by construction enterprises across the country under the illumination of the general line. Participating in the meeting were thirty-five construction delegations from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as industrial and transportation departments such as metallurgy, chemical industry, and railways, totaling more than 1,100 people.

The Nantong City Construction Engineering Company's Party Committee, Trade Union, advanced producers, and grassroots cadres introduced their experiences at the meeting. Representatives from more than twenty regions, including Beijing, Gansu, Shanghai, and Qinghai, also introduced their experiences in learning from Nantong, improving relations between cadres and the masses, and carrying out technical innovation movements. Through this meeting, the representatives gained a concrete and profound understanding of the Nantong Construction Engineering Company's experience in upholding political leadership and relying on the masses. Many regional representatives used concrete facts to illustrate the achievements they had made in learning the basic experience of the Nantong Company. After learning from the Nantong Company's experience, many units had leading cadres move into construction sheds to eat, live, and labor alongside the workers, improving relations between cadres and the masses and strengthening political and ideological work. The spirit of diligence and thrift, and hard work and plain living, has also been established in many units. All the representatives expressed at the meeting that they would earnestly and resolutely learn from the Nantong Company's experience, uphold political leadership in all work, and implement the mass line.

During the exchange of experiences in cadres participating in production, workers participating in management, and reforming rules and regulations (referred to as "two participations and one reform"), the representatives further recognized the great significance of relying on the masses and implementing the mass line, breaking the concept that enterprises can only be run well by relying on cadres, relying on large organizations, and relying on complicated rules and regulations. Many representatives believed that doing a good job in "two participations and one reform" is a revolutionary measure to thoroughly improve relations between cadres and the masses and to liberate the productive forces. Some representatives also examined the fact that they had not relied well on the masses in management, and thus had adopted methods such as "controlling," "貫 (貫穿, penetrating)," "卡 (carding)," and "monitoring" that were detached from the masses. Some representatives criticized the right-leaning conservative ideas that "two participations and one reform" would cause chaos, make things worse, and affect the quality of projects, etc., and that they did not trust the masses.

The representatives believed that technical innovation in the construction industry must also uphold political leadership, launch a vigorous mass movement, break the mysterious concepts in industrial construction, eliminate ideological obstacles such as low culture, shallow knowledge, and the inaccessibility of science and technology, establish a spirit of originality of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to act, and strive to basically realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of construction enterprises within two or three years. The employees of the Shanghai Construction Engineering Bureau, due to breaking superstitions, put forward more than 9,000 technical innovation proposals in one month, which is 50% more than the total number of proposals put forward during the first five-year plan period. They are determined to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization within one year, and complete mechanization and factoryization within two or three years. According to the experiences introduced by various regions, the representatives believed that the technical innovation movement must go through a development process from low-level to high-level, so it is necessary to attach importance to small but universally significant inventions and creations. In the movement, leadership and the masses, technicians and workers, popularization and improvement, and mechanization, semi-mechanization, and advanced manual tools must be combined to mobilize all positive factors and utilize everything that can be utilized to achieve greater results.

At the meeting, construction companies from Dalian and Qingdao also introduced their experiences in small companies undertaking large industrial construction tasks. The facts powerfully broke the mysterious concepts of industrial construction and set an example for relying on existing construction enterprises to undertake increasingly heavy construction tasks.

    技术革新必须坚持政治挂帅
    全国三十五个建筑代表团在南通开现场会议交流经验
    据新华社南通10日电　建筑工程部和中国建筑工会全国委员会2日到9日在南通市召开现场会议。这次会议的召开是为了进一步总结和推广南通的经验和交流各地的先进经验，以适应全国建筑企业在总路线照耀下所面临的工业建设的新形势。参加这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区和冶金、化工、铁道等工业和交通部门的三十五个建筑代表团，共一千一百多人。
    南通市建筑工程公司党委、工会、先进生产者和基层干部，在会上介绍了他们的经验。北京、甘肃、上海、青海等二十多个地区的代表也在会上介绍了他们学习南通、改善干部和群众关系、以及开展技术革新运动等方面的经验。通过这次会议，代表们对南通建筑工程公司政治挂帅、依靠群众等方面的经验有了具体深刻的认识。许多地区代表都用具体事实说明他们学习南通公司的基本经验中所取得的成绩。不少单位学习了南通公司的经验以后，领导干部搬进工棚跟工人同吃同住同劳动，改善了干部同群众的关系，加强了政治思想工作。勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的风气也在许多单位树立起来。全体代表都在会上表示，要认真地下决心学好南通公司的经验，在各项工作中做到政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线。
    代表们在交流干部参加生产、工人参加管理和改革规章制度（简称“两参一改”）的经验中，进一步认识到依靠群众，贯彻群众路线的重大意义，打破了那种认为只有依靠干部、依靠庞大的机构、依靠繁琐的规章制度才能搞好企业的观念。许多代表认为，搞好“两参一改”是彻底改善干部和群众关系、解放生产力的革命措施。有些代表还检查了在管理上没有很好依靠群众，因而在方法上采取了“管”、“贯”、“卡”、“监”等脱离群众的做法。有的代表批判了认为“两参一改”会搞乱、搞糟，影响工程质量等不相信群众的右倾保守思想。
    代表们认为建筑业的技术革新也必须政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，破除工业建筑中的神秘观念，扫除文化低、学识浅、科学技术高不可攀等思想障碍，树立敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的独创精神，争取两三年内基本上实现建筑企业的机械化和半机械化。上海建筑工程局职工由于冲破迷信，一个月中就提出九千多项技术革新建议，比第一个五年计划期间所提建议的总和还多50％。他们决心在一年内实现机械化、半机械化，两三年内全部实现机械化、工厂化。根据各地介绍的经验，代表们认为技术革新运动必然经过由低级到高级的发展过程，因此必须重视细小而带有普遍意义的发明创造。在运动中，领导和群众，技术人员和工人，普及和提高，机械化、半机械化和先进手工工具必须相结合，从而调动一切积极因素，利用一切可以利用的东西，达到更大的效果。
    在会上，旅大、青岛等地的建筑公司还介绍了小公司担任大工业建设任务的经验。事实有力地打破了工业建筑的神秘观念，为依靠现有建筑企业担负日益繁重的建设任务树立了榜样。（附图片）
