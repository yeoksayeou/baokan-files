Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th. The Chongqing Local State-Owned Xin Jian Machinery Factory, after a month and a half of hard work, successfully trial-produced a small car.

    This small car, named "Advanced," with the exception of the tires and a few electrical and mechanical parts, has its engine, gearbox, chassis, body, and other major machines and structures all manufactured by the factory itself. This small car is designed with great horsepower, and the maximum speed can reach 120 kilometers per hour.

    The Xin Jian Machinery Factory is a small car repair and fitting factory with outdated equipment, and most of the machines have exceeded their service life. When they started trial-manufacturing the small car, they had no official documentation. The factory leaders and relevant personnel referred to some pictorial magazines, designed it themselves, and boldly manufactured it. When there was not enough equipment, they used manual operation. Many important parts such as the body and beams were manufactured manually.

    小厂制成小轿车
    据新华社重庆15日电　重庆市地方国营新建机械厂苦战一个半月试制成功一部小轿车。
    这部被命名为“先进”牌的小轿车，除了轮胎和电气、机械上的个别部件以外，其余引擎、牙箱、底盘、车身等主要机器和结构，全部是这个厂自己制造的。这部小轿车设计的马力很大，每小时最快速度可达一百二十公里。
    新建机械厂是一个规模很小的汽车修配工厂，设备陈旧，大部分机器都超过了使用年限。开始试制小轿车的时候，没有任何正式资料，工厂领导干部和有关人员参考了一些画报杂志，就自己设计，大胆制造。设备不够，就用手工操作，像车身、大梁等许多重要部分都是手工制造的。
