Some of Our Experiences
The CCP Xinghua County Committee, Jiangsu Province

This year, the average yield of rapeseed in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, is about 250 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year's 185.6 jin per mu.

During the harvest season, in Duotian, Zhuhong, Zhoufen, Shagou and other townships where rapeseed grows more abundantly, people are rushing to harvest rapeseed as if they were celebrating a happy event. Around three o'clock every night, the lights are already on in many homes in the villages. Before the women have even finished cooking breakfast, the male commune members are going to the *duo* (a type of field) in groups by boat to harvest rapeseed. In this water-network area of intersecting lakes and rivers, everywhere you see boats loaded with large, pod-filled rapeseed being transported from the fields back to the villages and spread out on the threshing grounds and field slopes. Everywhere there are joyous songs:

"At Full Bloom (referring to "Xiaoman" solar term), the rapeseed turns yellow day and night,
Old and young bend their waists and rush to harvest busily,
Harvesting rapeseed under the starlight,
People race against the sun for time.
This year is another year of harvest,
The rapeseed grows like yellow clouds,
Branches and pods droop to cover the soil,
Not even eggs or duck eggs can roll in."

The characteristics of this year's rapeseed harvest in Xinghua are: many high-yield fields, many "rapeseed kings," and many double pods. The 125 mu of rapeseed fields in Linggou Agricultural Cooperative, Duotian Township, have a minimum yield of 200 jin per mu, with an average yield of about 350 jin per mu. Within this cooperative, twelve "rapeseed kings" with more than 3,000 to 8,000 pods per plant have already been discovered. An experimental plot of 0.8 mu cultivated by the cooperative cadres can yield more than 500 jin, becoming a banner for high yield in the entire cooperative.

Like other crops, the quality of cultivation and management has a great impact on increasing yield. From this year's rapeseed cultivation, we have gained the following experiences.

I. Eliminate Category III fields to ensure large-scale yield increases. This year, going to the fields, you can see a lot of rapeseed growing very well, but you can also find Category III fields that are not yet satisfactory. Therefore, eliminating Category III fields has become the key to increasing rapeseed yield. The county party committee has paid close attention to this year's Category III seedlings from beginning to end. At the three-level cadre meeting held by the county party committee last November, the first deployment was made, putting forward the slogan "Eliminate Category III and catch up with Category I, make the good even better." In January and February, the county party committee launched mass airing of views and debates on the cultivation of Category III wheat and rapeseed, continuously setting off a county-wide surge of fertilizing with mud, checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, and topdressing through surveying the types of fields and arranging measures. For example, more than 12,000 mu of rapeseed fields in Duotian Township were generally topdressed with mud three times this year. Furthermore, 40% were topdressed four times, and 80% were topdressed with human manure and chemical fertilizer, more than twice as many times as in previous years. After the rapeseed in Linggou Cooperative suffered from frost, they also proposed action slogans such as "Not a single seedling is missing, guarantee Category III catches up with Category I," and carried out competitions in replanting seedlings and field management. These actions won a relatively balanced rapeseed harvest this year. Within the county, some cooperatives did not replant seedlings in the fields damaged by frost in a timely manner, which was a loss. We must remember this lesson in future rapeseed cultivation.

II. Good seedlings, sufficient fertilizer, and sufficient water are indispensable conditions for high rapeseed yield. The main source of fertilizer (base fertilizer and topdressing) for Xinghua rapeseed is river mud. Using river mud as the main fertilizer for rapeseed has indeed increased production, but judging from this year's rapeseed cultivation, using only mud fertilizer is not enough. Mud fertilizer is slow-acting and cannot meet the needs of rapeseed growth. It is very necessary to give sufficient topdressing to late-planted rapeseed in the later stages. The nine fen of rapeseed on Wangjia’an in the fourth team of Linggou Cooperative had a poor foundation, was planted late, and no base fertilizer was applied. 80% of the seedlings were replanted after being damaged by frost. However, because this field was topdressed with 40 jin of chemical fertilizer (including 10 jin of phosphate fertilizer) in the later stage, the yield was still very high, reaching 270 jin per mu. Throughout the county, the rapeseed replanted after frost, all those that were topdressed with manure and chemical fertilizer grew very well. These situations tell us that the fertilizer issue for high-yield rapeseed is something we should pay attention to studying in the future.

III. Doing a good job in seed preservation and harvest protection is the only way to achieve large-scale yield increases. Due to natural disasters and man-made damage (eating), the "sow ten mu, harvest eight mu" phenomenon often occurs in our county's rapeseed production. How to ensure the harvest area has become a very important factor in whether our county's rapeseed can increase production. This year, some places did not do a good job in winter frost prevention, resulting in a significant reduction in the harvest area, which should be taken as a lesson.

Although our county achieved an unprecedented rapeseed harvest in 1958, judging from the many high-yield fields that have already appeared, the potential for rapeseed yield increase is still great. We are mobilizing the masses to select seeds and formulate plans for planting rapeseed next year and summarize experience, and strive for a greater harvest next year.

    我们的一些体会
    中共江苏兴化县委员会
    今年江苏省兴化县的油菜平均单产约二百五十斤左右，比去年亩产一百八十五斤六两，增产三成以上。
    在收获季节里，生长油菜较多的垛田、竹泓、周奋、沙沟等乡，人们抢收油菜像忙喜事一样。每天在夜间三点钟左右，村庄上好多人家灯火已明。妇女们早饭还未煮好，男社员就成群的划船上垛（一种田的名称）去收菜籽。在这湖河交叉的水网地区，到处看到一船船棵大荚多的油菜，从田间运回村庄，摊放在场头上、田坡上。到处是欢乐的歌声：
    “逢满（指“小满”）油菜日夜黄，
    老少弯腰抢收忙，
    头顶星星收菜籽，
    人与太阳抢时光。
    今年又是丰收年，
    油菜长得黄云般，
    枝荚垂头盖泥土，
    鸡蛋鸭蛋滚不入”。
    今年兴化油菜丰收的特点是：高产田多，油菜王多，双荚子多。垛田乡凌沟农业社的一百二十五亩油菜田，每亩最低的产量是二百斤，平均亩产可达三百五十斤左右。就在这个社内，每株三千多荚到八千多荚的油菜王，已经发现了十二个。社干部种的一块八分大的试验田，可以收到五百多斤，成为全社高产的旗帜。
    油菜和其他作物一样，培植管理工作好坏，对提高产量的作用很大。从今年的油菜培植中，我们得到如下一些体会。
    一、消灭三类田，保证大面积增产。今年到田里去可以看到大量长得很好的油菜，但是同样可以发现长得还不能令人满意的三类田。因此，消灭三类田就成了提高油菜产量的关键。县委对今年的三类苗自始至终抓得比较紧。在去年11月份县委召开的三级干部会上就做了第一次部署，提出“消灭三类赶一类，好的更加好”口号。在1、2月份，县委又对三类麦子、油菜的培植问题，开展了群众性鸣放辩论，不断通过排类型田、排措施，掀起了全县规模的?泥、查苗、补苗、追肥等工作。如垛田乡一万二千多亩菜籽田，今年普遍追了三次泥浆。还有40％追了四次，80％追了人粪和化肥，比往年多追了两次以上。凌沟社的油菜受冻以后，又提出：“不缺一棵苗，保证三类赶一类”等行动口号，开展了补苗和田间管理竞赛，这些行动赢得了今年比较平衡的油菜丰收。在全县范围内，有一些社没有在冻害的田中及时补上苗，这是一个损失，我们在今后培植油菜中，必须记取这个教训。
    二、苗好、肥足、水足是油菜丰产缺一不可的条件。兴化油菜的肥料（基肥和追肥）主要来源是河泥。把河泥作为油菜的主要肥料，确使油菜增了产，但是从今年的油菜培植情况看，只用泥肥，是不行的。泥肥效迟，不能满足油菜生长的需要。对于迟栽的油菜，在后期给予充足的追肥是十分必要的。凌沟社四队王家岸的九分油菜，底子差，栽的迟，并且未施基肥，有80％的苗是受冻以后补的。但是由于这块田在后期又追四十斤化肥
  （其中十斤磷肥），产量仍很高，亩产达到二百七十斤。全县在冻后补栽的油菜，凡是这样追了粪肥、化肥的生长都很好。这些情况告诉我们，油菜高产的肥料问题，是我们今后应该注意研究的。
    三、做好保种保收工作，才能达到大面积增产的目的。由于自然灾害和人为的损害（吃掉），我县的油菜生产常常发生“种十亩收八亩”的现象。如何保证收获面积，便成了我县油菜能否增产的一个很重要的因素。今年，有些地方因对冬天防冻工作做的不好，使收获面积减少很多，应该引为教训。
    1958年虽然我县油菜得到了空前的丰收，但从已经出现的许多高额丰产田看，油菜的增产潜力还是很大的，我们正发动群众进行选种及制订明年种植油菜的规划和总结经验，争取明年更大的丰收。
