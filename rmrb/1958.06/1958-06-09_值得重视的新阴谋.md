A New Conspiracy Worth Paying Attention To

    A dispatch from Indonesia says that a representative of the so-called "Free Taiwan Movement," named Chen Zhixiong, has recently emerged in Jakarta to conduct activities. This person visited Antara News Agency, claiming to be the "special envoy" to Southeast Asia dispatched by the "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" based in Tokyo, and that he had been instructed to open an "office" in Jakarta. This Khlestakov-like dubious character appearing in Jakarta at a time when Chiang Kai-shek’s clique in Taiwan colluding with Indonesian rebels has already aroused the hatred of all patriotic Indonesian people, is worthy of serious attention. He is obviously charged with the mission of attempting to create confusion among the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese at this time, muddying the waters and serving the United States in carrying out its conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
    The so-called "Free Taiwan Movement," or "Taiwan Independence League," or "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan," are all the same, merely a farce directed by the United States and acted out by the Chinese national scum, Liao Wenyi. He is a foreign slave trained by the United States. He has a "doctorate" from Ohio State University in the United States, and an American-style, slavishly named "Thomas Liao." Of course, these two points alone are not enough to gain the favor of American imperialism. What enabled him to become a running dog of the United States is his own boast of having more than ten years of history of advocating Taiwan’s reliance on the United States. He said that during the Pacific War, he hoped that the United States would occupy Taiwan. Therefore, when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, rapidly liberated all of China with overwhelming force in 1949, the United States saw that Chiang Kai-shek's ruling clique could no longer sustain itself. On the one hand, it issued a "White Paper" which foreign news agencies called practically tantamount to "writing off" the Chiang Kai-shek government, and on the other hand, it tried its best to seek out and support the so-called "third force," attempting to block the Chinese people's liberation movement. Liao Wenyi was rounded up by the United States under these circumstances. Later, Liao Wenyi ran to Japan, which was occupied by the U.S. military, gathered a small group of national scum who betrayed the motherland, and formed a lifeless "government." Whenever the United States clamored for "trusteeship" of Taiwan or attempted to create "two Chinas," this small group of scum would come out and jump around. From this, it can be clearly seen that this group of scum is a sinister tool prepared by the United States to continue to create a divided China in case Chiang Kai-shek becomes useless.
    The so-called "Taiwan Independence League" or "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" can exist in Japan is also inseparable from the consistent protection and support of the reactionary Japanese government. In particular, the Kishi Nobusuke government has worked extra hard to please the United States in helping the United States create a conspiracy of "two Chinas." Last December, when the Japanese delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference went to Cairo to attend the meeting, the Japanese authorities stuffed a Liao Wenyi group member into the plane and smuggled him to Cairo, attempting to sneak him into the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference venue to make trouble. It was only because of the vigilance of the Egyptian government and the timely measures taken that this conspiracy of the Japanese authorities failed. The Japanese authorities' harboring of the Liao Wenyi group, although instructed by the United States, also has its own plans. That is to try to use this group of scum to pave the way for re-interfering in Taiwan. This can also be seen from the Japanese government's consistent condoning of public opinion such as creating "Taiwan's return to Japan."
    Although the Liao Wenyi group has the support of the United States and the Japanese authorities, and their activities in Japan are not interfered with, the banner of Taiwanese they have put up has no market at all, even among Taiwanese compatriots living in Japan. In 1955, when the Liao Wenyi group held the so-called "Taiwan Provisional National Congress" in Tokyo, only forty people attended the "Congress" among the more than 25,000 Taiwanese compatriots living in Japan, and many of them later realized that they had been deceived. It can also be seen from here that the Liao Wenyi group, like the Chiang Kai-shek group, does not represent anyone except a small group of people themselves. Like the Chiang Kai-shek group, they were in the past, and are still today, tools in the hands of foreign imperialists who harbor aggressive ambitions towards Taiwan.
    This time, a so-called "special envoy" of the Liao Wenyi group appeared in Jakarta, obviously under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. This "special envoy" said that he was "very surprised" that no one in Indonesia knew about the so-called "Free Taiwan Movement," but this is exactly what he wanted. Precisely because no one or very few people know their details, he can take the opportunity to confuse the public when the Chiang Kai-shek group becomes even more notorious in the minds of the Indonesian people, attempting to harm the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and serve the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
    Everyone knows that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. The majority of Taiwan's residents are of Han Chinese descent, and of course, there are also many local ethnic minorities. But this is only a Chinese ethnic minority issue. The current abnormal state of Taiwan is entirely caused by the illegal occupation of the United States. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan will never waver, and we must achieve this goal. Anyone who wants to use the Taiwan issue to create a conspiracy to split China will eventually find that it is just a fantasy. As for the activities of Liao Wenyi and his ilk, who are willing to be running dogs of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and betray the motherland, they will one day be subject to the just judgment of the Chinese people.
    Indonesia is our friendly neighbor. The Indonesian government has always believed that our liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and opposes any conspiracy about "two Chinas." We believe that after the Indonesian government and people understand the truth about the Liao Wenyi group, this so-called "special envoy" will no longer be able to use his tricks in Indonesia.

### 值得重视的新阴谋

　　值得重视的新阴谋
    来自印度尼西亚的消息说，有一个自称所谓“自由台湾运动”的代表名叫陈志雄的人，最近突然在雅加达出面进行活动。这个人拜访了安塔拉通讯社，自称他是设在东京的“台湾共和国临时政府”派驻东南亚的
  “特使”，他已受命在雅加达开设“办事处”。这个乞乞科夫式的可疑人物，在台湾蒋介石集团勾结印度尼西亚叛乱分子已经引起所有印度尼西亚爱国人民痛恨的时候，出现在雅加达，是值得严重注意的。他显然负有这样的使命：企图趁这个时候在印度尼西亚人民和华侨中间引起混乱，混水摸鱼，替美国执行制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。
    所谓“自由台湾运动”，或“台湾独立同盟”，或“台湾共和国临时政府”，都是一样，不过是美国导演下的、由中国民族败类廖文毅串演的把戏。他是美国一手训练出来的洋奴才。他拥有美国俄亥俄州立大学的“博士”头衔，还有一个美国式的叫作“托马斯·廖”的奴气十足的名字。当然，单凭这两点，还不足以取得美帝国主义的青睐。使他能够成为美国一名走狗的，是他自己所吹嘘的具有十多年鼓吹台湾投靠美国的历史。他说，在太平洋战争时期，他就希望美国占领台湾。因此，当1949年中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，以摧枯拉朽之势迅速解放全中国的时候，美国见蒋介石统治集团已经无法撑持下去，一方面发表了外国通讯社称之为实际上等于“一笔勾销”蒋介石政府的“白皮书”，一方面则极力物色和扶植所谓“第三种力量”，妄图阻挡中国人民的解放运动。廖文毅就是在这种情况下被美国搜罗去的。以后，廖文毅跑到在美军占领下的日本，纠集了一小撮背叛祖国的民族败类，搞了个死魂灵“政府”，每当美国叫嚣“托管”台湾或企图制造“两个中国”的时候，这一小批败类就出来跳动一番。从这里，可以很清楚地看到，这批败类是美国准备在蒋介石一旦不中用的时候用以继续制造分裂中国的阴险的工具。
    所谓“台湾独立同盟”或“台湾共和国临时政府”能够在日本存在，同日本反动政府的一贯包庇和支持也是不无关系的。特别是岸信介政府，为了讨好美国，在帮助美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋方面更分外卖力。去年12月，日本参加亚非人民团结大会的代表团到开罗去开会的时候，日本当局就曾把一名廖文毅集团分子塞进飞机，用走私方式挟带到开罗，企图使他混进亚非人民团结大会会场，进行捣乱。只是由于埃及政府的警觉和及时采取了措施，日本当局的这一阴谋才未得逞。日本当局窝藏廖文毅集团，虽然是得到美国的指使，但也还有自己的打算。那就是企图借这批败类开道，重新染指台湾。这从日本政府一贯纵容制造“台湾复归日本”之类的舆论，也可以看出来。
    廖文毅集团虽然有美国和日本当局的支持，在日本的活动不受干涉，但是他们打出的台湾人的旗号，即使在侨居日本的台湾同胞中间，也完全没有市场。1955年廖文毅集团在东京召开所谓“台湾临时国民大会”时，在侨居日本的二万五千多名台湾同胞中间，只有四十人出席了“大会”，而且其中很多人后来认识是受了欺骗。从这里也可以看出，廖文毅集团正同蒋介石集团一样，除了代表他们本身一小撮人以外，并不代表任何人。他们同蒋介石集团一样，过去是，现在依然不过是对台湾抱有侵略野心的外国帝国主义手中的工具。
    这次，廖文毅集团的一名所谓“特使”出现在雅加达，显然是美帝国主义在背后指使。这名“特使”对印度尼西亚没有人知道所谓“自由台湾运动”，表示“很是奇怪”，其实这倒正中他的下怀。正因为没有人或很少人知道他们的底细，他才能趁蒋介石集团在印度尼西亚人民心目中变得更加声名狼籍的时候，钻出来混淆视听，企图损害中国和印度尼西亚两国之间的友好关系，并为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务。
    谁都知道，台湾是中华人民共和国的神圣领土的不可分割的一部分。台湾的居民大部分是汉族血统的居民，当然也有不少当地的少数民族。但这也只是中国的少数民族问题。台湾目前的不正常状态，完全是由于美国的非法占领而造成的。中国人民解放台湾的决心决不会动摇，而且我们一定要达到这个目的。任何人想利用台湾问题制造分裂中国的阴谋，到头来他们会发现那只是一场幻想。至于廖文毅之流甘愿作美日反动派走狗的背叛祖国的活动，也总有一天会受到中国人民的正义审判。
    印度尼西亚是我们友好的邻邦。印度尼西亚政府一向认为我们解放台湾是中国的内政，而反对任何关于“两个中国”的阴谋。我们相信，印度尼西亚政府和人民在弄清了廖文毅集团的真相以后，这个所谓“特使”将不能再在印度尼西亚施展他的伎俩。
