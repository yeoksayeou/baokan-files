　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: A sedimentary rock iron ore deposit discovered in an area of Hubei Province, after more than two years of prospecting and exploration by the geological exploration department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, is initially estimated to have prospective reserves of approximately two billion tons. About half of this is rich iron ore, which can be directly used in blast furnaces for iron smelting.

　　The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry initially plans to explore and prove industrial reserves of more than 500 million tons in this iron ore area during the Second Five-Year Plan period, in order to provide raw materials for new large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises. This mining area can also supply some rich iron ore to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise and the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant in the future.

　　After smelting pig iron from the iron ore in this mining area, the phosphorus content in the slag can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing phosphate fertilizer.

　　The advantage of this iron ore area is that it is very close to the Yangtze River, and the railway line needed for construction is only 250 kilometers long. This iron ore can be mined by tunneling, which is more economical than open-pit mining.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: A rich iron ore deposit discovered in an area of Hebei Province, which was originally thought to have a small deposit, has been confirmed by the geological exploration department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to be a large rich iron ore deposit with prospective reserves of 300 million tons after re-prospecting and exploration. Some of the iron ore in this deposit can also be used for open-hearth steelmaking.

　　The geological exploration department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry initially plans to explore and prove industrial reserves of 150 million tons for design and development in this rich iron ore area within three years.

　　This rich iron ore is distributed in several places within Wu'an County and She County in Hebei Province. The farthest is 150 kilometers away from the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, and the nearest is only dozens of kilometers away from the railway. To the south of the iron ore area is Fengfeng Coal Mine, the largest coking coal production base in Hebei Province, which is of great significance for establishing a new iron and steel production base near the iron ore area.

　　The Hebei Provincial Department of Industry is currently preparing to build an iron ore mine with an annual output of 3 million tons in this mining area. In addition to supplying medium and small iron and steel plants in the province, the iron ore will also be supplied to other state-owned iron and steel enterprises.

　　湖北河北发现巨大铁矿
    一个储量二十亿吨一个储量三亿吨
    据新华社2日讯  在湖北省一个地区发现的沉积岩铁矿经过冶金部地质勘探部门两年多的普查和勘探，初步估计铁矿远景储量约二十亿吨。其中约半数是富铁矿，可直接供高炉炼铁用。
    冶金部初步计划在第二个五年计划期间要在这个铁矿区探明五亿吨以上的工业储量，以便为新建大型钢铁联合企业提供原料。这个矿区今后还可以供应武汉钢铁联合企业和重庆钢铁厂部分富铁矿。
    这个矿区的铁矿在冶炼生铁后，炉碴中所含磷分还可以用作制造磷肥的原料。
    这个铁矿区的优点是离长江很近，建矿所需要建筑的铁路线只有二百五十公里。这个铁矿可采用坑道开采方法，比露天开采还要经济。
    据新华社2日讯  在河北省一个地区发现的富铁矿，原认为藏量不大，但经过冶金部地质勘探部门重新普查和勘探，证实是一个远景储量达三亿吨的大型富铁矿。这个铁矿的部分铁矿石还可供平炉炼钢用。
    冶金部地质勘探部门初步计划在三年内将在这个富铁矿区探明供设计开采用的工业储量一亿五千万吨。
    这个富铁矿分布在河北省武安县和涉县境内的好几处地方，最远的离京广铁路有一百五十公里，最近的离铁路只有几十公里。在铁矿区的南面就是河北省最大的炼焦煤产地——峰峰煤矿，这对在铁矿区附近建立新的钢铁生产基地具有重要意义。
    河北省工业厅目前准备在这个矿区建立一个年产三百万吨的铁矿。铁矿石除供应本省的中、小型钢铁厂外，还将供给其他国营钢铁企业。
