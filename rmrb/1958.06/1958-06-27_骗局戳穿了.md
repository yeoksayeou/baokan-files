	The Scam Exposed
    According to a report in the June 12th "New York Times," seventeen Hungarian refugees have already left the United States for Vienna, from where they will transit back to their home country. Before their departure, they said they would rather return to Hungary than stay in the United States any longer. Why leave the United States? They cited a variety of reasons, the main one being that they could not get used to the American way of life. They had tasted the flavor of this way of life: work was hard to find, and even when they had a "rice bowl," it was precarious. American factory owners treated them like Black people, and after losing their jobs, they weren't even entitled to so-called "relief funds"...
    These people left Hungary during the 1956 Hungarian incident, misled by Western reactionary propaganda and other reasons. Later, the United States took them in as refugees. At that time, the American propaganda machine used this topic to vigorously promote the so-called "free world" and the "happy" life in the United States, practically portraying the United States as a "paradise" for these refugees. However, paper cannot contain fire, and lies don't have long legs. The departure of this group of Hungarian refugees from the United States completely exposed Washington's scam.

    骗局戳穿了
    据6月12日“纽约时报”报道，十七个匈牙利难民已经离开美国到维也纳去，从那里转道回国。他们临行前说：宁愿回到匈牙利去，也不想再在美国呆下去了。为什么要离开美国呢？他们举出了各式各样的理由，而主要的一条则是不能习惯美国的生活方式。他们饱尝了这种生活方式的滋味：工作难找，有了“饭碗”又朝不保夕，美国厂主以对待黑人的手段对付他们，失业之后连所谓“救济金”都没有他们的份儿……。
    这些人是在1956年匈牙利事件期间被西方的反动宣传所蒙蔽以及其它原因而离开匈牙利的。后来美国当作难民收容了他们。当时美国的宣传机器借着这个题目大肆渲染所谓“自由世界”和美国的“幸福”生活，简直把美国说成是这些难民的“天堂”。但是，纸包不住火，谎言腿不长。这一批匈牙利难民离开美国一事，完全戳穿了华盛顿的骗局。
