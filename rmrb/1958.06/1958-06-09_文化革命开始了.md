　　The Cultural Revolution Begins

One of the basic points of the General Line for Socialist Construction is to gradually realize the technological revolution and the cultural revolution while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic front, the political front, and the ideological front. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China that in order to adapt to the needs of the technological revolution, a cultural revolution must be carried out simultaneously.

Now, after our country has undergone socialist revolutions in the ownership of the means of production and in ideology and politics, the productive forces have been greatly liberated, and hundreds of millions of laborers are exerting their utmost efforts, striving for the upper reaches, and working hard, quickly, well, and economically to build socialism. In practice, people have deeply felt that if productive forces are to be further and fully developed, there must be culture and technology. The main obstacles hindering the rapid development of productive forces are the backwardness of production technology and culture in our country. Many people say: "Socialism is paradise, but without culture, you cannot enter." The masses have urgently felt the necessity of mastering culture.

In the past few years, we have established thousands of modern industrial and mining enterprises, and production technology has begun to undergo major innovations. However, the vast majority of the 600 million people—farmers and many handicraft laborers—are still working with physical strength and simple tools. People yearn for mechanization, electrification, and industrialization. To realize this ideal, an important condition is to rapidly improve the cultural level of the people throughout the country. Lenin said in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues": "It is necessary to recognize that a communist society can only be built on the basis of modern knowledge, and without this knowledge, communism will always be just a wish." This sentence seems particularly relevant to us today.

The cultural revolution is a cultural emancipation movement for all working people. In the past, the exploitative system forcibly separated mental and manual labor. The exploiting classes deprived the working people of the right to learn culture, and in turn, despised the working people, calling them "ignorant and uneducated." They deliberately mystified culture and knowledge, leading people to mistakenly believe that culture was something unattainable. However, even under those difficult conditions, the working people still made great contributions to the development of human culture. Most inventors throughout history were working people with limited cultural knowledge. If the working people master cultural knowledge and theory and production practice are closely combined, then the development of science and technology and the entirety of human culture will undoubtedly be much faster. In the face of the fortress of culture, any sense of inferiority or superstitious notions on the part of the working people are unfounded. Smashing all the clay sculptures and wooden idols used by the exploiting classes to frighten the masses is an important prerequisite for mobilizing the masses to advance towards the great goal of the cultural revolution.

In the short span of eight years since liberation, our efforts have greatly changed the original backwardness of our country, both economically and culturally. In terms of culture, a vigorous upsurge of the cultural revolution has begun throughout the country. In the nationwide literacy campaign, a literacy army of 60 million people has emerged, and 156 counties across the country have eliminated illiteracy and are known as "illiteracy-free counties." A mass movement for running schools, centered on the popularization of primary schools, is being carried out across the country. At present, seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Heilongjiang, have basically universalized primary school education; in addition, according to incomplete statistics from 23 provinces and autonomous regions, 1,070 counties and cities have basically universalized primary school education, with 90% to 98% of school-age children enrolled. The number of newly established secondary schools in various regions is also staggering, with 16 provinces and cities also running more than 130 institutions of higher learning. Many new scientific research institutions have also been established in various regions. The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests has achieved great success. The transformation of old intellectuals and the training of new intellectuals are currently progressing smoothly. This cultural revolution situation is by no means isolated; it complements the technological revolution, and its purpose is to most rapidly develop the social productive forces. In the future, as long as we give play to the spirit of exerting all our strength and striving for the upper reaches, we will surely be able to achieve the great goal of the cultural revolution. The key issue here is that everyone must strive for the upper reaches, be determined to be at the forefront of the cultural revolution upsurge, and achieve all the goals of the cultural revolution.

The cultural revolution, like the technological revolution, like the entire socialist construction cause, and like any revolutionary cause, must follow the mass line. In the cultural revolution movement, we must first mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole Party and let the whole Party do it. The central government should run things, and the local governments should also run things, so that the central and local forces can be fully combined. If both the central and local governments run things, then the enthusiasm of each province, city, autonomous region, special district, county, and township can be mobilized. All levels of state organs and Party organizations must pay attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all working people and all intellectuals. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Only the enthusiasm of the leading cadres combined with the enthusiasm of the broad masses can prevent it from becoming a futile effort by a few. But if there is only the enthusiasm of the broad masses without strong leading cadres to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be sustained." At present, in places where the cultural revolution movement is being carried out well, the leadership and the masses have already been combined. But in some places, the masses are actively demanding to learn culture, while the leadership lags behind the masses. In other places, leading cadres value culture, but have not yet organized the enthusiasm of the masses. Any revolutionary movement cannot be carried out vigorously without the participation of the broad masses of the people. At present, there are still many outdated rules and regulations at work among cultural and scientific workers. Some people believe that cultural and educational undertakings can only be "run by the state." This idea limits the development of cultural undertakings. If it is only run by the state, there are limitations in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources; but if the masses also run it, the unlimited potential of the masses' financial, material, and human resources can be brought into play. Therefore, the correct policy is to fully combine the strength of the state and the strength of the masses. Some people believe that cultural and educational undertakings must have certain specifications, "adding one point is too long, subtracting one point is too short." This is a point of view that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. We are providing culture for the masses; whatever meets the needs of the masses is the standard of the masses' cultural revolution. All kinds of forms, all kinds of cultural organizations, all kinds of cultural undertakings, as long as there is a need and possibility, should be encouraged, and all outdated rules and regulations that hinder the interests of the masses should be abolished. Only in this way can our cultural undertakings be greatly developed and especially developed quickly, well, and economically. The cultural revolution can then be as irresistible as a force of nature, winning victory after victory.

In implementing the mass line and carrying out the great development of cultural and educational undertakings, we must correctly handle the relationship between popularization and improvement. Popularization and improvement are mutually complementary. At present, we must both popularize and improve. In our country, there are still many working people who are illiterate, and there are still many who have not reached the level of primary school. Therefore, it is very obvious that we should vigorously popularize. Without popularization, the working people cannot master cultural and scientific knowledge, and productive forces cannot be further developed. Of course, the speed of popularization depends on the specific conditions of each place and must be based on an appropriate foundation. While popularizing, we must also pay attention to improvement. The people's cultural undertakings have already developed considerably in the past eight years and must continue to advance rapidly. With the improvement of cultural undertakings, we can make great strides in science and production technology and catch up with and surpass the advanced levels of the world within twelve years. Popularization and improvement are both relative, and their specific combination should be adapted to the time and place. For example, private agricultural middle schools have recently developed greatly, which is popularization; at present, in places where they have already developed, while continuing to develop popularization work, we should pay attention to consolidating and improving the existing private agricultural middle schools. We will build a strong contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals in the process of continuous popularization and improvement within ten to fifteen years. The consolidation of the working class's revolutionary cause can only be achieved with such a contingent of working-class intellectuals.

In the ranks of the great march of the cultural revolution, who is the leader? Should it be led by the Party, or should it be led by experts? We say that it must be led by the Party. Politics is the commander, because politics is about resolving the relationships between people and determining the goals and policies of the entire cause. Any business cannot be separated from politics or from the leadership of the Party. The Party's line and policies are formulated by concentrating the experience and wisdom of the broadest masses, and then passed through consultation, research, and adoption with the masses by Party members in state organs, enterprises, cooperatives, people's organizations, and cultural and educational organs, and then implemented together with them, and prepared to be tested, supplemented, or modified based on practice. Therefore, cultural work, like other departments of national work, must be led by the Party.

The Cultural Revolution has begun. After achieving victory on the ownership and political-ideological fronts, the Chinese people are continuing to advance by leaps and bounds towards their beautiful ideals and happy path. Six hundred million workers, peasants, and intellectuals, march forward, overcome all difficulties, and seize the advanced red flag of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution in an era of great leaps forward in the history of the country! In ten or twenty years, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: Let us appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture!

### 文化革命开始了

　　文化革命开始了
    社会主义建设总路线的基本点之一，是在继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命。刘少奇同志在中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议上的报告中指出，为了适应技术革命的需要，必须同时进行文化革命。
    现在我国经过了生产资料所有制和思想上政治上的社会主义革命，生产力得到了大解放，几亿劳动大军都鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地为建设社会主义而奋斗。人们在实践中已经深刻地感觉到，要生产力进一步充分地得到发展，就要有文化，有技术。现在妨碍着生产力迅速发展的主要障碍是我国生产技术的落后和文化的落后。许多群众说：“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上。”群众已经迫切地感到掌握文化的必要了。
    我们在最近几年来已经建立了成千上万个现代化工矿企业，生产技术已开始了重大的革新。但是六亿人民的绝大多数——农民和很多手工业劳动者，还是凭着体力和简单工具在劳动。人们向往着机械化、电气化、工业化。要实现这个理想，一个重要的条件就是要使全国人民文化水平迅速提高。列宁在“青年团的任务”中说过：“必须认清，只有在现代知识基础上，才能建立共产主义社会，如果不通晓这种知识，那共产主义就始终不过是一种愿望而已。”这一句话对于今天的我们格外显得说到了痒处。
    文化革命是全体劳动人民的文化翻身运动。在过去，剥削制度硬生生地把脑力劳动和体力劳动割裂开来。剥削阶级剥夺了劳动人民学文化的权利，反过来却卑视劳动人民，把劳动人民说成“愚昧无知”。他们故作玄虚，把文化知识神秘化，使人们误认为文化是高不可攀的东西。但是，即使在那种困难的条件下，劳动人民仍然对人类文化的发展作了巨大的贡献。历代的发明家，大多数是出身于文化知识不高的劳动人民。如果劳动人民掌握了文化知识，理论和生产实践得到了密切结合，那么，科学技术和整个人类文化的发展无疑更要迅速多少倍。在文化的堡垒面前，劳动人民的任何自卑心理和迷信观念都是没有根据的。打碎剥削阶级用来吓唬群众的一切泥塑木雕的偶像，是动员群众向文化革命的伟大目标进军的重要前提。
    解放以来短短八年的时间，无论在经济方面或是文化方面，我们的努力已经大大地改变了我国原有的落后面貌。就从文化方面来说，现在全国各地已经普遍地开始了蓬蓬勃勃的文化革命的高潮。全国扫盲运动中已经出现了六千万人的扫盲大军，全国已有一百五十六个县消灭了文盲，被称为“无文盲县”。以普及小学为中心的群众办学运动正在全国开展起来，目前江苏、浙江、河南、湖南、福建、江西、黑龙江等七省已经基本上普及了小学教育；另外根据二十三个省和自治区的不完全统计，已有一千零七十个县和市基本上普及了小学教育，学龄儿童入学的占90％到98％。各地新办的中学数字也是惊人的，有十六个省市还举办了一百三十多所高等学校。许多新的科学研究机关也在各地成立了。以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动获得了巨大的成绩。旧知识分子的改造和新知识分子的培养工作目前进展都比较顺利。这个文化革命的形势完全不是孤立的，它同技术革命相辅而行，其目的就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。今后，只要我们发挥鼓足干劲、力争上游的精神，我们就一定能够实现文化革命的伟大目标。这里关键的问题是人人都要力争上游，决心走在文化革命高潮的前头，实现文化革命的全部目标。
    文化革命同技术革命一样，同整个社会主义建设事业和任何革命事业一样，必须走群众路线。在文化革命运动中，首先要调动全党的积极性，要全党来干。中央办，地方也办，要把中央力量和地方力量充分结合起来。中央地方都办，那就可以调动起各省、市、自治区、专区、县、乡的积极性。各级国家机关和党组织都必须注意调动全体劳动人民、全体知识分子的积极性。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性不可能持久。”目前，凡是文化革命运动开展得好的地方，领导与群众已经结合起来。但有的地方，群众积极要求学文化，而领导落后于群众。也有的地方，领导干部重视文化，但还没有把群众的积极性组织起来。任何革命运动，没有广大人民群众的参加是不可能轰轰烈烈地开展的。目前在文化科学工作者之中还有许多清规戒律在作祟。有人认为，文化教育事业只能由“国家办”。这种思想局限了文化事业的发展。仅仅由国家办，在人力、物力、财力上都有局限性；而群众也办，就可以把群众的财力物力人力的无限潜力发挥出来。因此，正确的方针是把国家的力量和群众的力量充分结合起来。有人认为，文教事业必须有一定的规格，“增之一分则太长，减之一分则太短”。这是一种脱离群众脱离实际的观点。我们是为群众办文化，什么样的合乎群众的需要，什么样的就是群众的文化革命的正规。各种各样的形式，各种各样的文化组织，各种各样的文化事业，只要有需要和可能，都应当鼓励，妨碍群众利益的清规戒律应当一律取消。只有这样，才能多快好省地使我们的文化事业大发展而特发展。文化革命才能势如破竹，节节胜利。
    在贯彻群众路线，进行文教事业的大发展中，要正确地对待普及和提高的关系。普及和提高是相辅相成的。目前我们既要普及，又要提高。我们国家的劳动人民中，还有很多人不识字，还有很多人达不到初级小学的水平，因此，很显然，我们应当大力普及。不普及，劳动人民不能掌握文化科学知识，生产力就得不到进一步的发展。当然，普及的速度，要看每个地方的具体条件，要建立在适当的基础上。在普及的同时，也要注意提高。八年来人民的文化事业已经有了相当的发展，必须继续迅速前进。文化事业有了提高，我们才能在科学上、生产技术上大步前进，在十二年内赶上和超过世界先进水平。普及和提高，都是相对的，它们的具体结合要因时因地制宜。比如民办农业中学，最近有了很大的发展，这是普及；目前，在已经发展起来了的地方，在继续发展普及工作的同时，就应该注意巩固和提高现有的民办农业中学。我们将在不断普及和提高的过程中，在十年至十五年内，建成一支强大的成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍。有这样一支工人阶级知识分子队伍的建成，工人阶级的革命事业才能得到巩固。
    在文化革命大进军的行列里，谁是领导者？是要党来领导，还是要专家来领导？我们说，必须由党来领导。政治是统帅，因为政治是解决人和人的关系的，是规定整个事业的目标和政策的。任何业务不能脱离政治，脱离党的领导。党的路线和政策，是集中了最广大群众的经验和智慧而制定，然后又经过党员在国家机关中、在企业中、在合作社中、在人民团体中、在文化教育机关中，在同群众一起商量、研究、通过，再同他们一起去执行，并且准备根据实践再加以考验、补充或修改的。因此，文化工作和国家工作的其他部门一样，都必须由党来领导。
    文化革命开始了。中国人民在取得所有制和政治思想战线上的胜利之后，正在大踏步地向着自己的美好的理想、幸福的道路继续前进。六亿工人、农民和知识分子，前进吧，在国家历史上的伟大的飞跃发展的时代，克服一切困难，夺取技术革命、文化革命的先进红旗！在十年二十年以后，像毛泽东同志说过的那样：让我们以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界！
