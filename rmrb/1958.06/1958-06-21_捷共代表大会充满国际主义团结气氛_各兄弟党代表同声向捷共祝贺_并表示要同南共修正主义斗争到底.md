Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 19th: The 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party continued its discussions on the afternoon and evening of the 19th. Eleven delegates spoke at the afternoon session. Purhlik, Director of the Political Department of the Czechoslovak Army, emphasized the importance of strengthening the Party's leadership and expanding democratic life in the army, and also criticized past weaknesses in this regard.

    Murstina, a representative from Hradec Kralove Region, pointed out in his speech that revisionism is the main danger at present, a poison that undermines and weakens the workers' movement from within. It is necessary to fight it resolutely and strengthen the ideological education of the people.

    In the afternoon session, in addition to the head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, the heads of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, and the German Socialist Unity Party also delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. They all warmly congratulated the convening and success of the congress, emphasizing the fraternal friendship and solidarity between the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the Czechoslovak people.

    Raiko Damyanov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, said that the Czechoslovak Communist Party, mature, firm, and loyal to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, stands today at the forefront of the international communist movement. Speaking of the imperialists' attacks on the solidarity of the socialist camp, he said that the imperialists are currently using revisionism to attack.

    Damyanov said that today, the nest of modern revisionism is in Belgrade, in the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He added that the current struggle against revisionism is primarily a struggle against the anti-Marxist-Leninist stance of the Yugoslav leaders. In the struggle to uphold the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, revisionism will undoubtedly and inevitably be defeated.

    Login-Sowinski, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, said that the Polish United Workers' Party believes that the solidarity of the socialist camp based on Leninist principles is the most important thing, and therefore it has adopted a critical attitude towards the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which deviates from Marxist-Leninist principles on many important issues and violates the interests of the unity of the international workers' movement. The Polish United Workers' Party believes that the Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto are the only correct action programs for the Communist Parties and the entire revolutionary workers' movement.

    Before the adjournment of the afternoon session, the Presidium read out the congratulatory telegram from the Japanese Communist Party.

    The congress continued in the evening of the 19th. Representatives of various Communist and Workers' Parties continued to deliver congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

    Gheorghe Drăghici, head of the Romanian Workers' Party delegation and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee, said that the Romanian Workers' Party firmly opposes the revisionist theories contained in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The slanders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia leadership against the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the vicious distortion of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism will only harm the international communist and workers' movement and benefit the imperialist reactionaries. The Romanian Workers' Party will continue to vigorously fight back against all attempts to revise Marxist ideas and will fight to strengthen the unity of Communist and Workers' Parties.

    Auguste Pioux, head of the French Communist Party delegation, member of the Politburo and Secretary of the Secretariat of the French Communist Party, said that the French Communist Party is engaged in a major struggle to save the Republic. He said that only by recognizing Algeria's right to independence can the Algerian problem be resolved peacefully.

    Speaking of the danger of fascism in France, he said that the working class and conscious democratic forces will not be intimidated, and with the help of the Communist Party, they have launched a struggle against fascist dictatorship and war and organized resistance.

    Vittorio Spano, head of the Italian Communist Party delegation and member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, spoke of the great victory won by the Italian Communist Party in the recent elections. Spano also pointed out that the recent events in France should also make the Yugoslav Communists understand the serious error of their practice of using the contradictions between artificially created large and small countries to replace the contradictions between socialist and capitalist countries. He added that not only the Communists, but life itself will condemn the ideological and political stance of the Yugoslav Communists.

    Hysni Kapo, head of the Albanian Party of Labor delegation and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee, said that the victory of Czechoslovakia strengthens the strength of the entire socialist camp. Kapo also spoke of the despicable attacks made by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia program on the Soviet Union and socialist countries. He said that the Yugoslav leaders are shameless traitors serving the imperialists, especially the US imperialists. There is not and never will be any force in the world that can undermine the unity of the socialist camp and damage the victorious Marxist-Leninist ideas.

    Jenő Fock, head of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegation and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee, expressed his gratitude to the Czechoslovak people for their solidarity and selfless assistance to the Hungarian people during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots. He pointed out that defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and opposing the revisionist errors of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia leadership is the international obligation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

    Dugersuren, head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party delegation and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee, spoke of the danger of revisionism clearly expressed in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and assured the congress that the Mongolian Party will fight against the distortion of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, against attempts to deny the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union and its historical experience, and against attempts to undermine the unity of socialist countries.

    When the heads of the fraternal party delegations spoke, the venue was filled with an atmosphere of close comradely love of proletarian internationalism. The representatives of the fraternal parties brought the friendship and congratulations of the working people of the world to the congress, and also expressed their admiration and high trust in the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak people.

    捷共代表大会充满国际主义团结气氛
    各兄弟党代表同声向捷共祝贺
    并表示要同南共修正主义斗争到底
    据新华社布拉格19日电　捷共第十一次代表大会在19日下午和晚间继续进行大会讨论。在下午会议上发言的有十一位代表。捷克斯洛伐克陆军政治部主任普尔赫利克在发言中强调指出了在军队中加强党的领导和扩大民主生活的重要性，也批判了过去在这方面的弱点。
    赫拉岱茨州的代表姆尔斯蒂纳在发言中指出，修正主义是当前主要危险，是从内部破坏和削弱工人运动的毒素，必须对它进行坚决斗争，同时要加强对人民的思想教育。
    在下午会议上，除了中国共产党代表团团长外，在会上致祝词的还有保加利亚共产党、波兰统一工人党、德国统一社会党代表团团长。他们都热烈地祝贺大会的召开和成功，强调同捷共、同捷克斯洛伐克人民之间的兄弟友谊和团结。
    保共中央政治局委员拉·达米扬诺夫说，成熟、坚定和忠于马克思列宁主义思想的捷克斯洛伐克共产党今天是站在国际共产主义运动的最前列。他在谈到帝国主义者对社会主义阵营团结的进攻时说，帝国主义者目前正在利用修正主义来进攻。
    达米扬诺夫说，今天，现代修正主义的巢穴是在贝尔格莱德，是在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导集团中。他又说，目前反对修正主义的斗争首先是反对南斯拉夫领导人的反马克思列宁主义的立场的斗争。在为维护马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁性而进行的斗争中，修正主义无疑将不可避免地遭到失败。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员洛加—索文斯基说，波兰统一工人党认为，以列宁主义原则为基础的社会主义阵营的团结是最重要的东西，因此它对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领采取了批判的态度，这个纲领在许多重要问题上背离了马克思列宁主义原则，违反了国际工人运动团结的利益。波兰统一工人党认为，莫斯科宣言与和平宣言是共产党和整个革命工人运动的唯一正确的行动纲领。
    下午会议休会前，主席团宣读了日本共产党的贺电。
    代表大会在19日晚间继续举行。各国共产党和工人党代表继续在会上致祝词。
    罗马尼亚工人党代表团团长、中央政治局委员德勒吉奇说，罗马尼亚工人党坚决反对南共纲领中所包含的修正主义理论。南共领导人对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的诽谤以及对马克思列宁主义基本理论的恶毒歪曲只会损害国际共产主义和工人运动，而有利于帝国主义反动派。罗马尼亚工人党将继续有力地反击修改马克思主义思想的一切企图，并且为加强共产党和工人党的团结而斗争。
    法国共产党代表团团长、法共政治局委员、书记处书记皮佑说，法国共产党正在进行重大的斗争来挽救共和国。他说，只有承认阿尔及利亚的独立权利才能使阿尔及利亚问题得到和平解决。
    他在谈到法国的法西斯主义的危险时说，工人阶级和自觉的民主力量不会被吓倒，在共产党的帮助下，他们对法西斯独裁和战争展开了斗争并且组织了抵抗。
    意大利共产党代表团团长、意共领导机构成员维·斯巴诺谈到意大利共产党在最近选举中获得的巨大胜利。斯巴诺还指出，法国最近的事件也应该使得南斯拉夫共产主义者了解他们用人造的大国和小国之间的矛盾来代替社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的矛盾这种做法的严重错误。他又说，不仅共产党人，而且生活本身也会谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者在意识形态和政治方面的立场。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长、中央政治局委员卡博说，捷克斯洛伐克的胜利加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量。卡博还谈到了南共纲领对苏联和社会主义国家所进行的卑鄙的攻击。他说，南斯拉夫领导人是为帝国主义者、特别是美帝国主义者服务的无耻叛徒。世界上没有而且也决不会有任何力量能够破坏社会主义阵营的团结和损害胜利的马克思列宁主义思想。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团团长、中央政治局委员福克·耶诺对捷克斯洛伐克人民在匈牙利反革命暴乱期间给予匈牙利人民的声援和无私的援助表示感谢。他指出，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、反对南共领导集团的修正主义错误是匈牙利社会主义工人党的国际义务。
    蒙古人民革命党代表团团长、中央政治局委员杜格苏伦谈到了南共纲领所明显表示出来的修正主义的危险，他并且向代表大会保证，蒙古党将要进行斗争反对对马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说的歪曲，反对否认苏联共产党及苏联的领导作用和它的历史经验的企图，反对破坏社会主义国家团结的企图。
    在兄弟党代表团团长讲话时，会场上洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的亲密友爱气氛。兄弟党的代表带来了世界各地劳动人民对大会的情谊和祝贺，也表达了他们对捷共和捷克斯洛伐克人民的钦佩和高度信任。
