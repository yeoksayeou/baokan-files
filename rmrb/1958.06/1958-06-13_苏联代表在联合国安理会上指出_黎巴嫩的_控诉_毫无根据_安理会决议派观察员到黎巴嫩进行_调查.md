Xinhua News Agency, June 12th, New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on the 11th, deciding to send an observation committee to Lebanon to investigate the Lebanese government's so-called "accusation" of the United Arab Republic "interfering" in Lebanon's internal affairs.

This resolution was proposed by the Swedish representative and was adopted with ten votes in favor and the Soviet Union abstaining. Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the Soviet Union's abstention should not be interpreted as any change in the Soviet Union's attitude towards Lebanon's "accusation." He said that this "accusation" is groundless, and this vote by the Security Council shows that the Council has not expressed any opinion on this "accusation." The Soviet government hopes that no country will interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, thereby ensuring international peace.

The United Arab Republic representative Lutfi, who had no right to vote, said that he did not object to the Swedish resolution because the United Nations sending an observation committee was mainly Lebanon's own business, as this committee only operates within Lebanon.

After the Security Council finally announced an indefinite adjournment, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld announced that the first group of personnel from the observation committee appointed by him would leave for Lebanon on the 12th.

    苏联代表在联合国安理会上指出
    黎巴嫩的“控诉”毫无根据
    安理会决议派观察员到黎巴嫩进行“调查”
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会11日通过一项决议，决定派遣一个观察委员会到黎巴嫩去调查黎巴嫩政府提出的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”黎巴嫩内政的“控诉”。
    这个决议案是瑞典代表提出的，它以十票赞成，苏联弃权而获得通过。苏联代表索波列夫在发言时指出，苏联的弃权并不能被解释为苏联对黎巴嫩的“控诉”的态度有任何改变。他说，这个“控诉”是毫无根据的，安全理事会这次表决表明，理事会对于这个“控诉”并没有表示意见。苏联政府希望，任何一国都不要干涉中东国家的内政，从而保证国际和平。
    没有表决权的阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲说，他不反对瑞典的决议案，因为联合国派遣观察委员会主要是黎巴嫩自己的事，因为这个委员会只在黎巴嫩境内活动。
    在安全理事会最后宣布无限期休会后，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德宣布，由他任命的观察委员会的第一批人员将在12日前往黎巴嫩。
