　　Street Poems on the General Line
　　The General Line is a Lamp
    Zhang Xuexin
    The General Line is a lamp,
    Shining bright day and night.
    The General Line is a boat,
    Everyone rows swiftly like an arrow.
    The General Line is a banner,
    Wherever it's planted, there's victory.
    The General Line is a flower,
    Blooming in everyone's heart.
    You Say
  　Zhang Xuexin
    You say: When walking,
    Don't fear slowness, only standing still.
    I say: No!
    Walking the socialist road,
    Only speed is allowed, no slowness!
    Daring to Think and Daring to Do
    Li Xue'ao
    Having learned the General Line,
    Daring to think and daring to do.
    Drawing blueprints overnight,
    Experimenting at dawn.
    The machine is made at noon,
    ?? turning in the afternoon.
    The factory director doesn't even know,
    The new chicken (machine) is already laying eggs.
　　Workers' High Aspirations
    Li Xue'ao
    Workers' aspirations are high,
    Skilled hands and clever minds.
    Three inventions a day,
    Five creations in three days.
    Hey hey yo, experts can't compare!
    Workers' aspirations are high,
    Skilled hands and clever minds.
    Steel obeys commands,
    Thunder and lightning obey whistles.
    Everyone surpasses living immortals,
    Even Zhuge Liang must come to learn!

　　总路线街头诗
　　总路线是盏灯
    张学新
    总路线，是盏灯，
    白天黑夜放光明。
    总路线，是条船，
    大家摇橹飞如箭。
    总路线，是杆旗，
    插到哪儿，哪儿胜利。
    总路线，是朵花，
    人人心里开着它。
    你说
  　张学新
    你说：走路呀，
    不怕慢，只怕站。
    我说：不！
    走社会主义的路，
    只许快，不许慢！
    敢想又敢干
    李学鳌
    学了总路线，
    敢想又敢干。
    连夜画图纸，
    天亮搞试验。
    中午机制成，
    下午??转。
    厂长还不知，
    新鸡（机）又下蛋。
　　工人志气高
    李学鳌
    工人志气高，
    心灵手又巧。
    一日三发明，
    三日五创造。
    嘿嘿哟，专家比不了！
    工人志气高，
    心灵手又巧。
    钢铁听命令，
    雷电听口哨。
    人人赛过活神仙，
    诸葛亮也得来请教！
