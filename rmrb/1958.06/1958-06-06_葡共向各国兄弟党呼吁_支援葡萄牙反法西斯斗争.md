Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch. According to the Chilean "Siglo" newspaper not long ago, the Portuguese Communist Party appealed to the people of all countries, all communist parties and workers' parties, to support the Portuguese people who are engaged in a long-term struggle under fascist rule.

    This appeal was issued by the Portuguese Communist Party after its Fifth National Congress held in October last year.

    The appeal pointed out that the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal is built on a huge repressive machine led by a political police force. In the political and social life of the country, the basic civil liberties stipulated in the constitution have been completely deprived. Under the thirty-one years of dictatorial rule, homes can be illegally searched at any time. Women and young people with different political ideas, or even without any political views, are imprisoned. Many of them are tortured to death. They are thrown into political prisons in mainland Portugal and the "death camp" in Tarrafal (on the island of Green Cape on the Atlantic coast of Africa) without trial or after a brief trial. The struggle of the working masses for economic rights is often hindered by the political police. Libraries and bookstores are illegally searched. The political police search the residences of progressive writers and prohibit scholars and artists from traveling abroad and attending international conferences.

    The appeal stated that this kind of suppression has been increasing, and seventy patriots have already been sentenced to imprisonment in the first few months of this year.

    The appeal pointed out that for more than thirty years, the Portuguese people have continuously launched protests and large-scale demonstrations against the fascist regime. Agricultural workers unite to fight for reasonable wages, and university students unite to resist increasingly expensive tuition fees, oppose the imprisonment of their classmates, and oppose anti-democratic decrees. Various social and political strata across the country have voiced calls for a peaceful resolution of Portugal's political problems, but the government's response to this national call is persecution and imprisonment.

    Finally, the Portuguese Communist Party appealed to all fraternal parties to once again support the Portuguese people's struggle against the atrocities of the Salazar dictatorship, against "security measures," against violations of freedom, human rights, and civil rights, and for amnesty.

### 葡共向各国兄弟党呼吁  支援葡萄牙反法西斯斗争

    葡共向各国兄弟党呼吁
    支援葡萄牙反法西斯斗争
    新华社4日讯　据不久以前的智利“世纪报”报道，葡萄牙共产党呼吁世界各国人民、各国共产党和工人党，支援在法西斯统治下进行长期斗争的葡萄牙人民。
    这个呼吁是葡萄牙共产党在去年10月举行第五次全国代表大会以后发出的。
    呼吁书指出，葡萄牙的萨拉查独裁政权是建立在一个政治警察所领导的庞大的镇压机器上。在国家的政治和社会生活中，完全剥夺了宪法所规定的基本的公民自由权利。在三十一年的独裁统治下，任何时候住宅都会遭到非法搜查。有不同政治思想，甚至没有任何政治见解的妇女和青年被监禁起来。其中很多人被严刑拷打至死。他们没有经过审讯，或在经过简短的审讯之后便被投入葡萄牙本土的政治监狱和塔拉法耳（在非洲大西洋岸的绿角岛上）的“死亡营”里。工人群众争取经济权利的斗争经常受到政治警察的阻难。图书馆和书店被非法搜查。政治警察搜查进步作家的住宅，并且禁止学者和艺术家到国外旅行和参加国际会议。
    呼吁书说这种镇压活动有加无已，在今年头几个月里就已经有七十个爱国者被判处徒刑。
    呼吁书指出，三十多年以来，葡萄牙人民不断掀起了反对法西斯政权的抗议和大规模示威游行。农业工人团结起来进行争取合理工资的斗争，大学生团结起来反抗日益昂贵的学费，反对把他们的同学投入监牢和反对反民主的法令。各个社会和政治阶层在全国各地发出了要求和平解决葡萄牙的政治问题的呼声，而政府对这个民族呼声的回答却是迫害和监禁。
    葡萄牙共产党最后呼吁各兄弟党再一次地支持葡萄牙人民为反对萨拉查独裁政权的暴行、反对“安全措施”、反对侵犯自由、人权和公民权以及争取大赦的斗争。
