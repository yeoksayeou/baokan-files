    Success or Disaster
    The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a meeting at the beginning of this month to re-examine U.S. foreign policy. At the meeting, four Assistant Secretaries of State who attended from the State Department defended U.S. policies in the Far East, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe. In the end, Dulles himself attended and portrayed recent U.S. diplomacy as highly effective and without flaws.
    But what are the facts? In Latin America, Nixon's "goodwill visit" ended in a shameful retreat. In the Middle East, Lebanon has launched a fierce struggle against the pro-American regime. In the Far East, U.S. support for Indonesian rebels has been strongly condemned. In Western Europe, the U.S. practice of exporting economic crises has caused dissatisfaction...
    Dulles and his assistants' claim that these are "successes" of U.S. foreign policy is obviously self-deception. Therefore, even Senator James Warburg, who attended the meeting, angrily wrote to the "New York Times" and raised the question: "Does it require some even greater disaster to shake Mr. Dulles's truly unbelievable self-satisfaction?" Indeed, it is time for the American ruling group to wake up.

### 成效还是灾难

    成效还是灾难
    美国参议院外交委员会于本月初举行了重新审查美国外交政策的会议。会上国务院出席作证的四位国务卿帮办为美国在远东、中东、拉丁美洲和欧洲的政策进行了辩解，最后杜勒斯还亲自出席把最近一个时期美国的外交说成是卓有成效，毫无缺陷。
    但是事实怎样呢？在拉丁美洲，尼克松的“亲善访问”以狼狈逃归结束。在中东，黎巴嫩掀起了如火如荼的反对亲美政权的斗争。在远东，美国支持印度尼西亚叛军的行为受到强烈的谴责。在西欧，美国输出经济危机的作法引起了不满……。
    杜勒斯和他的几位帮办把这些说成是美国外交政策的“成效”，显然是自欺欺人。因此连出席会议的参议员杰姆斯·华勃也气愤地写信给“纽约时报”提出了这样一个问题：“难道还须要什么更大的灾难才能动摇杜勒斯先生的实在令人难以置信的自满？”的确，应该是美国统治集团清醒的时候了。
