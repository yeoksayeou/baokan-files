Small Cooperatives Have Become a Stumbling Block to the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture
Liaoning Combines Production to Complete Cooperative Mergers

(Our Newspaper Dispatches) Reporter Yang Shaoshan reports: In the past month or so, the broad countryside of Liaoning Province, in combination with current production, has widely carried out the work of merging agricultural cooperatives. This is a major measure taken by farmers in various localities under the leadership of the Party in order to meet the upcoming technological revolution and to make the relations of production more suitable for the leap forward development of productive forces.

At present, the work of merging cooperatives in various places has basically come to an end. The number of agricultural cooperatives in the province has been reduced from the past 9,297 to 1,551. The average number of households per cooperative after the merger is 1,855, basically achieving one cooperative per township. The general adjustment and expansion of the scale of agricultural cooperatives has further greatly liberated the vigorously developing productive forces.

The mass upsurge of cooperative mergers in Liaoning Province has been launched on the basis of the important experience and achievements gained in pilot large-scale cooperatives in various places over the past few years, and on the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, in order to adjust the relations of production and develop productive forces. In the past two years, the province has piloted 375 large-scale cooperatives with more than 1,000 households each. Each city and county generally has several or a dozen large-scale cooperatives. These large-scale cooperatives have demonstrated their unique superiority over small cooperatives in giving full play to the effectiveness of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Some large-scale water conservancy projects, basic farmland construction, and other production-increasing measures that many small cooperatives simply could not accomplish have been accomplished by the large-scale cooperatives. Before Gaiping County's Taiyangsheng Cooperative merged into a large-scale cooperative of 2,400 households in 1956, the original Henan Village small cooperative had more than 2,000 mu of land suitable for development into paddy fields. They had wanted to develop it for several years, but could not due to insufficient manpower and material resources. After the merger, more than 1,800 mu were developed in the first year, and the grain output of these lands doubled that year. This cooperative, due to fully utilizing the advantages of the large-scale cooperative in other aspects, has reached or exceeded the level of the wealthy middle peasants in the past in terms of the production and livelihood of the entire cooperative in just two years, becoming a banner for running large-scale cooperatives in the province. Therefore, farmers have realized that small cooperatives have become a stumbling block to the further development of large-scale agricultural production, and they demand that there must be adaptive production relations with the development of productive forces. Especially in early March of this year, after the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call to achieve "three self-sufficiencies" (grain, pork, vegetables) in the province in one year and "agricultural mechanization and electrification in five years," this further encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to merge into large-scale cooperatives, pave the way for mechanization, raise funds for electrification, and maximize the potential of the socialist agricultural economy. In order to realize this wish, they sent representatives, jointly wrote applications, and repeatedly requested higher authorities in meetings and verbally to approve their merger into large-scale cooperatives based on townships. Before Heishan County approved the county to run large-scale cooperatives, the County Committee of the Communist Party of China received many calls and applications from townships and cooperatives every day, requesting approval to run large-scale cooperatives. Many small cooperatives, while applying to merge, also made production plans after the merger, and proposed to guarantee that they would definitely run the large-scale cooperatives well. Some cooperatives even proposed that if the leadership did not approve their merger, they would jointly run "black large-scale cooperatives." The masses' urgent demand to merge cooperatives reached an unprecedented height.

Party committees at all levels, based on production needs and the demands of the broad masses, approved the merger applications.

The cooperative merger work in various places is closely integrated with current production. Generally, under the leadership of the township party committee, a unified merger is adopted to establish upper-level leadership organizations, the production and labor organization basically remains unchanged, and the specific problems after the merger are gradually handled by specialized agencies. In this way, the workload during the merger period is greatly reduced, and the large-scale cooperatives can concentrate their main forces on doing a good job in current production after the merger. Cooperatives in Yingkou, Chaoyang, Gaiping, Liaoyang and other counties have all called on their members to use practical actions to do a good job in current production as a gift for the merger into large-scale cooperatives, which greatly promoted current production. After the merger of cooperatives in Yingkou County, through the rational organization of labor and the full exploitation of funding potential, the county constructed 81 medium and large-scale reservoirs, dug more than 100 new deep wells, and expanded the irrigated area of paddy and dry land by more than 520,000 mu in just over a month. In addition, 45,000 mu of new wasteland were reclaimed and six small power stations were built.

    小社已经成了农业大跃进的绊脚石
    辽宁结合生产完成并社工作
    本报讯  记者杨绍山报道：辽宁省广大农村最近一个多月来，结合当前生产广泛进行了农业社的合并工作。这是各地农民在党的领导下，为了迎接即将到来的技术革命和使生产关系更加适合生产力的飞跃发展而采取的一项重大措施。
    目前，各地并社工作已经基本结束。全省农业社社数已由过去的九千二百九十七个并成了一千五百五十一个。合并后的社平均户数为一千八百五十五户，基本上实现了一乡一社。农业社办社规模的普遍调整和扩大，使蓬勃发展的生产力进一步得到了大解放。
    辽宁省的群众性并社高潮，是在几年来各地试办大社取得了重要经验和成就以及今年农业生产大跃进的基础上，为了调整生产关系、发展生产力而掀起来的。在过去两年中，全省试办了三百七十五个一千户以上的大社，每个市、县一般都有几个或十几个大社，这些大社在充分发挥人力、物力、财力效能上，都显示了它比小社独具的优越性。许多小社根本办不到的一些大型水利工程、农田基本建设和其他增产措施，大社都办到了。盖平县太阳升社在1956年合并为两千四百户大社以前，原河南村小社有两千多亩适合开成水田的土地，几年想开都因为人力、物力不足，而没有开成。并社以后，头一年就开了一千八百多亩，这些地的粮食产量当年就翻了一番。这个社，由于在其他方面也充分发挥了大社的优越性，仅仅两年的时间，全社的生产和社员生活，就全部达到或超过了过去当地富裕中农的水平，成为全省办大社的一面旗帜。因此农民都认识到小社已经成了进一步发展农业大生产中的绊脚石，他们要求随着生产力的发展，必须有一个适应的生产关系。特别是在今年3月初，中共辽宁省委提出全省一年实现“三自给”（粮食、猪肉、蔬菜）和“五年实现农业机械化、电气化”号召以后，这就更加鼓舞了农民们合并大社、为机械化铺平道路、为电气化筹集资金、最大限度地发挥社会主义农业经济潜力的热情。他们为了实现这一愿望，纷纷选派代表、联名写申请书和在会议上、口头上，三番五次地请求上级批准他们并成以乡为单位的大社。黑山县在批准全县办大社以前，中共县委每天都接到很多次来自乡、社的电话和申请书，要求批准他们办大社。许多小社一面申请并社，一面作出了并社以后的生产规划，并提出保证一定要把大社办好。有的社甚至还提出如领导方面不批准他们并社，他们就联合办黑大社。群众迫切要求并社的热情空前高涨。
    各级党委根据生产需要和广大群众要求，批准了并社申请。
    各地的并社工作，都是密切结合当前生产进行的，一般都是在乡党委领导下，采取了统一合并建立上层领导机构，生产劳动组织基本不动，并社后的具体问题由专门机构逐渐处理。这样，就大大减少了并社期间的工作量，大社并成后便可以把主要力量集中到搞好当前生产上去。营口、朝阳、盖平、辽阳等县的合作社都在并社同时，号召社员以搞好当前生产的实际行动做为并大社的献礼，大大推动了当前生产。营口县并社后经过合理组织劳动力和充分挖掘资金潜力，全县仅仅一个多月的时间，就修较大型水库八十一座，新打深井一百多眼，扩大水旱田灌溉面积五十二万多亩。另外，还新开荒地四万五千亩，建小型发电站六座。
