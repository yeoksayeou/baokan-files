    In the rural areas of Pinggu County, Hebei Province, large slogans reading "Marching towards Science, Waging War against the Earth" can be seen everywhere. This is the heroic and豪迈 vow made by the people of Pinggu County as they launch their battle to extract non-ferrous metals from the barren mountains. The people of this county are currently experiencing an unprecedented revolutionary era of demanding metal resources from the earth. More than two thousand red flags, indicating underground ore deposits, flutter in the wind above three hundred mountain peaks. In mid-May, five thousand farmers laid down their hoes and went up the mountains, taking up hammers as miners. Since then, the earth-shattering sounds of blasting have been incessant. In just over ten days, they have opened up more than five hundred working faces on two hundred and thirty-eight mountains spanning a hundred miles, and they have put forward this year's production target as "a county producing ten thousand taels of gold and ten million catties of copper."

    Pinggu County is located at the southern foot of the Yanshan Mountains. Mountains account for two-thirds of the county's area, and mineral resources are abundant. In the past, only a few farmers regularly went up the mountains to mine gold, while the various rich non-ferrous metals buried in the mountains could not be exploited and were ignored. Because there were many mountains and little land, a saying circulated among the people here in the past: "Living at the foot of a rich mountain, life is not rich." The Party Central Committee's call for the whole Party and the whole people to run industry, like a beacon, illuminated the path for the Pinggu County Party Committee to lead the people to march into the deep mountains. The County Party Committee decided to launch a mass mining production campaign to bring various mineral deposits to the surface and serve the country's industrialization.

    The news that the Pinggu County Party Committee had decided to lead the people in mining spread like lightning throughout every village in the county. Agricultural cooperatives held meetings one after another to study how to ensure the realization of "double leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and double harvest in grain and minerals." After discussions among the members, those who remained in the cooperative to work ensured that they would wait for the sun (early departure) and chase the moon (late return) every day; hoeing and weeding during the day and making ridges at night. Among the three hundred or so people in the whole village, twenty-five young and strong farmers could be deployed to go up the mountain to mine. After mass research and discussion, all agricultural cooperatives in the county formulated measures to ensure that "agriculture and mining do not interfere with each other," and the county could squeeze out five thousand farmers to go up the mountain to mine during the busy farming season.

    To start mining, it is necessary to find out where the mineral deposits are located. A "native exploration team" composed of thirty-four old gold miners, middle school students, and cadres was formed. A small hammer, a fifteen-times magnifying glass worth only a few cents, and a booklet on "How to Recognize Ores" were their exploration "instruments." Carrying these tools, they searched for ore veins by traversing mountains and ridges during the day, and at night they used ten adobe bricks to build a furnace and use bellows to blow air to smelt the ore for identification and testing. The enthusiasm of the masses for reporting and finding mines was also very high. Farmer Geng Peizhang ran for several miles to send a piece of ore he found while chopping firewood at Dataomu to the exploration team. After testing, a lead ore line was found there. Similar moving examples occurred almost every day. In the first week of May, no less than five thousand people reported mines. In more than twenty days, this native exploration team traversed more than five hundred mountain peaks, collected more than three hundred kinds of ore samples, found one hundred and forty-six ore veins containing fifteen kinds of metals such as copper, lead, gold, silver, and zinc, and arranged more than two thousand positions for more than twenty thousand people to go up the mountain to mine.

    The farmers in the eight villages near the mine, after learning that five thousand people would be going up the mountain to mine, vacated their houses before the workers went up the mountain, and arranged food and accommodation for the more than three thousand workers who came from afar. Yanzhuang Village vacated eighty-seven houses in one day. Zhang Baoyu's newly built five-room house with tile roof had not yet been moved into, but it was given to the workers as a kitchen. They also automatically and actively squeezed out time to repair the roads leading to the mine. They widened and leveled the trails, and even teenagers picked up iron shovels to participate in this work.

    The "new tenants" who live here often receive help and care from the landlords. The landlords not only provide them with firewood for cooking, but also help them chop and collect support wood in the mine. Tawa Village alone sent more than 13,000 catties of support wood to the miners.

    开发沉睡的燕山
    本报记者　吕素瑄
    在河北省平谷县的农村里，到处可以看到写着“向科学进军、向地球开战”的大幅标语，这是平谷县人民展开向荒山索取有色金属战斗发出的英雄的豪迈誓言。这个县的人民目前正经历着史无前例的向地球要金属原料的革命时代，表明地下藏有矿石的两千多面红旗，在三百多个山头上空迎风飘扬。5月中旬五千名农民放下了锄头，上山拿起锤头作了采矿工人，自此开山的惊天动地的炮声整日不绝。他们在短短的十几天里，在长达百里的二百三十八个山头上，开拓了五百多个掌洞进行采矿，他们提出了今年的生产指标是“万两黄金县，铜产一千万（斤）”。
    平谷县位于燕山南麓，山地占全县面积的三分之二，矿产丰富。过去这里只有少数农民经常上山采金，而埋藏在万山丛中的各种丰富的有色金属，却无法开采，也无人过问。因为山多地少，过去在这里的人民中间曾流传着：“生在富山下，生活并不富”。党中央提出全党全民办工业的号召，像一盏指路明灯，照亮了中共县委领导人民向深山进军的道路，县委决定开展一个群众性的声势浩大的采矿生产运动，使各种矿藏出土，为国家工业化效劳。
    中共平谷县委决定领导人民开矿的消息，像闪电般地迅速传遍了全县的每一个村庄。各农业社纷纷召开大会，研究怎样保证实现“工农业生产双跃进，粮食、矿产双丰收”。经过社员讨论后，留在社里劳动的保证每天要等太阳（早出）、赶月亮（晚归）；白天锄地薅草，夜间作畦地。在全村的三百多人中，就能够调配出二十五名青壮农民上山采矿。全县各农业社经过群众性的研究讨论，都分别制订出保证“农业开矿两不误”的措施，在农忙的季节里全县能挤出五千名农民上山开矿。
    要开矿首先就要摸清什么地方有矿藏，一支由三十四名采金老工人、中学生、干部组成的“土勘探队”组成了。一把小锤子、一个只值几角钱的十五倍的放大镜，和一本“怎样认识矿石”的小册子，就是他们的勘探“仪器”，他们携带着这些工具白天翻山越岭的寻找矿苗，晚上利用十块土坯砌成炼炉用风箱鼓风，烧炼矿石进行识别和化验。群众报矿找矿的积极性也非常高，农民耿佩章把他在大桃木打柴时发现的一块矿石，跑了好几里路送给勘探队，经过化验勘探就在那儿找到了铅矿线，类似这种动人的事例几乎天天出现。在5月份的第一周，群众报矿的不下五千人。这支土勘探队在二十多天的时间里，翻越了五百多个山头，采集了三百多种矿样，找到了藏有铜、铅、金、银、锌等十五种金属的矿线一百四十六条，安置了可供两万多人上山采矿的二千多个镐位。
    靠近矿山的八个村庄的农民们，知道了将有五千人上山采矿的消息后，他们在工人上山前，纷纷腾出房子来，给远道而来的三千多名工人安排好食宿。宴庄村在一天内就腾出了八十七间房子。张保玉最近盖好的五间新瓦房，还没有搬进去就让给工人作了伙房。他们还自动积极的挤出时间来修整通向矿山的道路，他们把小道开宽填平，连十几岁的孩子们也拿起铁锨来参加这项工作。
    住到这里来的“新房客”，经常受到房主的帮助和关怀。房主不但供给他们作饭的柴火，还帮助他们砍集矿洞里的撑木，仅塔洼村就送给矿工一万三千多斤撑木。
