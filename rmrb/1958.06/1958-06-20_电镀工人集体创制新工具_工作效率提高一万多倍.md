    Electroplating Workers Collectively Create New Tool
    Working Efficiency Increased More Than 10,000 Times
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th -- An Zhen, Dong Xiangrui, Niu Xuezhong, and Wang Shoushan, electroplating workers of the Eighth Workshop of the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, collectively successfully trial-produced a "universal electroplating tumbler tool" on the afternoon of the 14th, increasing the efficiency of electroplating nuts and screws by more than 10,000 times, and the electroplating quality is also very high.
    In the past, this factory used iron wires to hang nuts and screws one by one for electroplating. It could only electroplate 70 pieces at a time, taking 33 minutes. Due to the low electroplating efficiency, the completion of the entire production task was often affected. For example, the task of electroplating screws and nuts in April of this year was not completed until May. An Zhen and others recently thought: "The General Line requires us to build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, but how can we do it if we can't even complete the task?" They visited the small tumbler electroplating parts at the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory and were greatly inspired. After returning to the factory, they immediately drew drawings and successfully trial-produced it after two days of hard work. Now, with the universal electroplating tumbler tool, it can load 720,000 pieces at a time and be electroplated in 28 minutes, solving the key problem in the factory's production.

### 电镀工人集体创制新工具  工作效率提高一万多倍

    电镀工人集体创制新工具
    工作效率提高一万多倍
    新华社太原17日电　山西机床厂八车间电镀工人安震、董祥瑞、牛学忠和王寿山，14日下午集体试制成功一种“万能电镀滚筒工具”，使电镀螺帽、螺钉的效率提高一万多倍，电镀质量也很高。
    这个厂过去是用铁丝把螺帽、螺钉一个一个地吊起来电镀，一次只能电镀七十件需时三十三分。由于电镀效率低，整个生产任务的完成经常受到影响，如今年4月份的电镀螺钉、螺帽任务，拖到5月份也没有完成。安震等最近在想：“总路线要我们多快好省地建设社会主义，可是我们连任务都完不成怎么能行？”他们到经纬纺织机械制造厂参观了小滚筒电镀零件，受到很大启发，回厂后马上绘制图纸，经过两天的苦战便试制成功。现在用万能电镀滚筒工具，一次可装七十二万件，二十八分钟就镀完了，解决了这个厂生产中的关键问题。
