Preventing Heatstroke in Postpartum Women
    Wei Xin

    According to old Chinese customs, to prevent postpartum women from catching cold, regardless of how hot the weather is, the doors and windows of the postpartum room are always tightly closed. The postpartum woman also wears several layers of thick clothing, wraps her head in a headscarf, and is not allowed to wash her hair or bathe. She is also covered with a thick quilt while sleeping, and the postpartum woman's diet is also hot. Due to the above habits, when the weather is very hot, the heat in the postpartum woman's body cannot be dissipated, and the function of regulating body temperature is impaired. This often leads to postpartum women suddenly experiencing a rise in body temperature, confusion, and other symptoms of heatstroke. If prompt first aid is not received, death from heatstroke can occur. In the past two years, many places have experienced postpartum women dying from heatstroke. Now that it is hot summer weather again, those unreasonable old habits must be changed to prevent postpartum women from suffering heatstroke.

    First, the indoor air where the postpartum woman resides must be circulated: It is correct that postpartum women should not be directly exposed to wind after childbirth. However, postpartum women still need to breathe fresh air frequently, so keeping the doors and windows tightly closed is not a good idea. The upper windows should be opened. If there are no windows above, the windows can be opened and covered with a layer of damp cloth or curtains; the bed can also be moved to a place where the wind cannot blow directly.

    The thickness of the postpartum woman's clothing and bedding should also be prepared according to the cold or hot weather conditions, so that the postpartum woman feels comfortable. It is not advisable to wear too much or too thick clothing.

    Postpartum women's diet should pay attention to hygiene and cleanliness, and the temperature should be appropriate. Boiling food is in line with hygiene requirements, but it is not necessary to eat it while it is hot to avoid excessive sweating.

    In the past, postpartum women had many dietary restrictions, and avoiding raw and cold foods was especially common. In fact, as long as we pay attention to hygiene, and soak fruits and vegetables in potassium permanganate (commonly known as potassium permanganate) solution and then rinse them with cold boiled water, postpartum women can eat them completely. When the weather is very hot, postpartum women should drink more cold boiled water (it is better to add a little salt to the boiled water), or drink mung bean soup.

    Postpartum women exert a lot of effort during childbirth and sweat a lot. It is very comfortable to wash the postpartum woman's hair and wipe her body one or two days after childbirth. It is best to have someone help with the washing to avoid the postpartum woman getting too tired. Just avoid direct wind exposure after washing your hair.

    It is not appropriate to sit in a basin to bathe while lochia has not yet cleared during the postpartum period, but you can wipe your body with warm water. Wiping your body once or twice a day in hot weather is possible. Frequent bathing not only keeps you clean and regulates body temperature, but also promotes blood circulation, which is also beneficial for milk secretion.

    If it is found that the postpartum woman has symptoms of heatstroke, the windows should be opened immediately, or the postpartum woman should be moved to a cool place. Loosen the postpartum woman's clothing, wipe her body with liquor or cold water, cover her head with a cold water towel, and give her cold boiled water or soda and other cold drinks. And quickly ask a doctor for treatment.

    防止产妇中暑
    卫新
    按照我国老习惯，为了怕产妇受凉，不管天气多热，产妇房内总是门窗紧闭，产妇还要穿上几件厚衣服，头上包上头巾，而且不能洗头洗澡，睡觉时还要盖上厚被，产妇的饮食也是热的。由于以上的习惯，当天气很热时，产妇体内的热量不能向外发散，调节体温的机能受到障碍，往往因此发生产妇体温突然上升，神智昏迷等中暑现象。如果得不到及时的急救，还会因中暑死亡。前两年，许多地方都曾发生过产妇中暑死亡事故，目前又是天气炎热的夏天，必须改变那些不合理的老习惯，防止产妇中暑事故。
    首先，产妇居住的室内空气要流通：产妇在产后不直接吹风是对的。但是产妇还要经常呼吸到新鲜空气，所以门窗紧闭不是个好办法。应当把上面的窗户打开，如果上面没有窗，可把窗户打开后糊上一层冷布，或拉上窗帘；也可以把床挪在风不能直接吹到的地方。
    产妇的衣被厚薄也要根据气候冷热的情况来准备，让产妇觉得合适就行，不宜穿盖过多、过厚。
    产妇饮食要注意卫生清洁，冷热适度。把东西煮开了吃是合乎卫生要求的，但不必趁热吃以免出汗过多。
    过去产妇忌嘴很多，忌吃生冷更是普遍。其实只要我们注意卫生，把瓜果用过锰酸钾（俗称灰锰氧）水泡过，再用冷开水冲洗，产妇完全可以吃。天气很热时，应该让产妇多喝冷开水（在开水里放一点点食盐更好），或喝绿豆汤。
    生孩子时产妇很用劲，出汗很多，如果产后一两天给产妇洗洗头，擦擦身是很舒服的。有人帮着洗最好，以免产妇过累。洗过头后只要不直接吹风就行了。
    月子里恶露未尽，坐在盆里洗澡是不合适的，但是可以用温水擦身，热天每天可擦一、二次。常擦澡不仅可以保持清洁，调节体温，而且可以促进血液循环，对乳汁分泌也有好处。
    如果发现产妇已有中暑现象，要立即把窗户打开，或把产妇移到阴凉的地方。把产妇的衣服解开，用烧酒或冷水替她擦身，用冷水手巾复盖头部，灌喂冷开水或汽水等清凉饮料，并且快请医生来救治。
