Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

The farmers of all ethnic groups in the northern Tianshan Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, through their battle actions, have rapidly overcome the summer blizzard and frost disasters, unprecedented in over fifty years, safeguarding the fruits of their labor gained through hard work last winter and this spring. This frost and snow disaster occurred from May 29th to 30th, caused by the invasion of Arctic cold air. The blizzard struck farmland in more than a dozen counties along the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. Now, with the exception of some farmland that was severely affected and needs to be replanted, all localities have victoriously overcome the disaster.

Faced with these sudden natural disasters, all localities, under the battle cry of "the whole Party mobilized, the whole people mobilized," waged a tenacious struggle against the disaster. At this moment, the general line of socialist construction was also transmitted to both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, further raising the morale of the people of all ethnic groups. On the day of the snowfall, the Secretary of the Changji County Party Committee, the County Head, and all county cadres went to agricultural cooperatives in various locations, braving the snow to lead the masses in the struggle against the disaster. During the disaster relief effort, members of agricultural cooperatives of all ethnic groups toiled day and night in the snow, bringing clothes, bedding, and sacks to cover seedlings, preventing frost and freezing. Farmers in the suburbs of Urumqi rescued thousands of mu of vegetable seedlings.

　　新疆战胜夏季大风雪
    据新华社电　新疆维吾尔自治区天山北部各族农民以战斗行动，迅速战胜了五十多年来未有过的夏季大风雪和霜冻灾害，保卫了去冬今春苦战得来的劳动成果。这次霜雪灾害发生在5月29日到30日，是受到北极寒潮侵袭引起的。风雪袭击了沿天山北麓十几个县的农田。现在，各地除部分农田受灾较重需改种外，都胜利渡过了灾难。
    面对这些自然灾害的突袭，各地在“全党动员、全民动员”的战斗口号下与灾害展开了顽强搏斗。正在这时，社会主义建设总路线又传到了天山南北，各族人民斗志更加高昂。降雪当天，中共昌吉县委书记、县长和全县所有干部就冒雪分赴各地农业社，领导群众进行抗灾斗争。在抗灾斗争中，各族农业社社员日夜奔波在雪地里，把衣服、被褥、口袋都拿来覆盖禾苗、防霜防冻。乌鲁木齐市郊区农民抢救了数千亩菜苗。
