　　Daring to Think and Act, Accelerating Construction Speed
    D冶 Steel Plant's No. 1 New Open Hearth Furnace Taps Steel Ahead of Schedule; Taiyuan No. 2 Thermal Power Plant Begins Partial Power Generation
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 1st: The first new open hearth furnace in the expansion project of D冶 Steel Plant tapped its first batch of steel this afternoon ahead of schedule, and the quality of the steel is good.
    Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Head of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Urban Industrial Work Inspection Team, congratulated the workers of D冶 Steel Plant on behalf of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee today, and cut the ribbon for the steel tapping of the open hearth furnace. He encouraged everyone to dare to think, dare to learn, dare to act, break down superstitions, go all out, and strive for the upstream, and strive to advance the other parts of the expansion project ahead of schedule. Soviet and East German experts who are helping with the production and construction at D冶 Steel Plant also came to the site today to congratulate.
    The early steel tapping of the No. 1 open hearth furnace of D冶 Steel Plant has laid a good foundation for the early and comprehensive completion of the entire expansion project. Other new workshops and new open hearth furnaces will be put into production one after another this year following the No. 1 open hearth furnace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 1st: The newly built modern high-temperature and high-pressure Taiyuan No. 2 Thermal Power Plant began partial power generation today. At 1:47 PM today, the first powerful current generated by the plant was officially connected to the Taiyuan area power grid, and transmitted to factories, mines, and rural areas that urgently need electricity.
    The Taiyuan No. 2 Thermal Power Plant was designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union, and the main equipment was also supplied by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet government also sent experts to help with various construction and installation projects.
    Under the encouragement of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the workers responsible for building the plant only took three and a half months to install various equipment and put it into production four months ahead of schedule, saving more than one million yuan in construction funds.

　　敢想敢干加快建设速度
    大冶钢厂一号新平炉提前出钢  太原第二热电厂开始局部发电
    据新华社武汉1日电　大冶钢厂扩建的第一号新平炉今天下午提前炼出了第一炉钢，钢的质量良好。
    中共湖北省委书记处书记、湖北省委城市工业工作检查总团副总团长张平化，今天代表湖北省委向大冶钢厂的职工祝贺，并且为平炉出钢剪了彩。他勉励大家要敢想、敢学、敢干、大破迷信、鼓足干劲、力争上游，把扩建工程的其它部分争取提前再提前。在大冶钢厂帮助生产建设的苏联和民主德国的专家，今天也都到现场祝贺。
    大冶钢厂一号平炉提前出钢，为这个厂整个扩建工程提前全面竣工打下了良好基础。其他新车间和新平炉，将继一号平炉之后陆续在今年投入生产。
    据新华社太原1日电　新建的现代化高温高压太原第二热电厂今天开始局部发电。今日下午一时四十七分，这个厂发出的第一股强大的电流正式并入太原地区的电力网，输送到迫切需要电力的工厂、矿山和农村。
    太原第二热电厂是苏联帮助设计的，主要设备也是苏联供应的。同时，苏联政府还派来专家帮助进行了各项建设和安装工程。
    负责建厂的职工们，在鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，只用了短短三个半月的时间，就安装好了各种设备，提前四个月投入生产，并节约了一百多万元建设资金。
