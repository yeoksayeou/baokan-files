　　Historical Proof
　　——Materials on Forty-One Major Inventors of Mechanical and Electrical Technology
　　Office of Policy Research, First Ministry of Machine Building
　　This collection contains short biographies of forty-one important inventors in the history of mechanical and electrical technology over the past two hundred years. The historical facts fully prove that the inventions and creations of science and technology mostly originate from the working people, and mostly come from those with low social status, little education, and poor conditions.

　　Among these forty-one best-known inventors of mechanical and electrical technology, twenty-five basically had no formal schooling, came from working-class backgrounds, and were looked down upon, attacked, and suppressed by society before their inventions. Eight people had received some schooling, but were not "experts" in mechanical and electrical engineering; they were originally engaged in other professions and became "experts" through studying from being "outsiders." Only seven people had received specialized technical education and worked in mechanical and electrical factories or research departments, but before their inventions, they were just ordinary engineers, researchers, assistants, etc., and not any kind of authority. There is one other person whose resume information could not be found, and the situation is unknown.

　　(I) Basically No Formal Schooling

　　Newcomen (England) 1663—1729
　　A blacksmith by origin. At the age of thirty-five, he improved the water pumping machine powered by steam, and at the age of forty-two, he invented the atmospheric engine.

　　Polzunov (Russia) 1728—1766
　　Born into a soldier's family, he worked as a factory apprentice and a mining and smelting technician. At the age of thirty-five, he proposed a steam engine design, and three years later, he successfully manufactured it, making it the world's first industrially applicable steam engine. He also formulated some basic laws of thermodynamics.

　　Watt (England) 1736—1819
　　His father was a bankrupt small businessman. He apprenticed at an instrument factory at the age of eighteen. At the age of twenty-eight (1764), he repaired Newcomen's steam engine at the University of Glasgow and noticed that a large amount of steam was being wasted, so he invented the separate condenser. It took four years of experiments to complete the manufacturing. The steam engine was fully tested successfully in 1774. The Industrial Revolution began due to the invention of the steam engine.

　　Evans (America) 1755—1819
　　Born into a poor peasant family. When he was young and studying, he used wood shavings to light the fire for illumination. Later, he became a worker. At the age of twenty-two, he invented the wool carding machine. At the age of thirty-two, he invented the high-pressure steam engine, which was a further advancement than Watt's.

　　Hargreaves (England) 1745—1778
　　Worked as a carpenter and weaver, without education. At the age of twenty-two (1767), he made the spinning jenny, and later improved the cotton gin. The machines he manufactured were opposed by the artisans of the time.

　　Arkwright (England) 1732—1792
　　Born into a poor peasant family, without formal schooling. He worked as a barber and sold wigs. He only worked in a textile factory in his thirties. In 1769, he invented the roller spinning frame, which was powered by water.

　　John Kay (England) Dates of birth and death unknown
　　A weaver who invented the flying shuttle automatic loom in 1733. His machine was opposed by artisans. He fled to France and died in poverty.

　　Howe (America) 1819—1867
　　Born into a farming family, he worked as a machinist and watchmaker. At the age of twenty-six, he designed and manufactured the sewing machine.

　　Grinkov (Russia) Dates of birth and death unknown
　　A technician from a working-class background, he invented the spinning machine in 1760, nine years earlier than Arkwright. Because it was not valued, it was not further improved and promoted.

　　In 1903, their 750-pound, 12-horsepower airplane was successfully test-flown.

　　Nartov (Russia) 1694—1756
　　Born as a serf, he was a court mechanic during the reign of Peter the Great. Before 1729, he manufactured the world's first lathe with a tool post, which was the ancestor of all modern machine tools. Unfortunately, it was not put into practical use.

　　Whitney (America) 1756—1825
