Why Laborers Are the Smartest
　　Gan Ziyu
    The general line for building socialism has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the prelude to the technological revolution has begun. The inventions and technological improvements from the laboring masses are truly blooming in full splendor, full of vitality. Today's newspaper has again published a batch of historical materials, indicating that most of the inventions and creations in science and technology over the past two hundred years have come from laborers and "outsiders." These facts all show that it is precisely the "humble" that the bourgeois gentlemen look down upon who are the smartest, while the "noble" are the most foolish.
    These facts have greatly encouraged the ambition of the workers, peasants, old cadres, and "small" intellectuals. Once the wisdom of the broad masses is awakened, the pace of advancing towards the technological revolution will surely be rapid and unstoppable.
    Facts speak louder than words. The truth that laborers are the smartest does not need much explanation. However, in the past hundred years, old China was in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial position, and the laboring people suffered greatly from oppression. After the victory of the revolution, they were liberated politically and turned over economically, but they have not yet completely turned over in science and culture; the fear of bourgeois experts and professors and the superstition of science and technology have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, in addition to presenting the facts, further explaining why laborers are the smartest will still be helpful in breaking down superstitions.
    Now, let us try to explain this issue from the following three aspects.
    I. Labor Practice Creates Science
    Labor not only created mankind and history, but also created science and culture. This is one of the basic viewpoints of Marxists regarding science and culture.
    Science is the understanding of the laws of natural phenomena by mankind in the struggle for production. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Practice": "First, Marxists believe that human productive activity is the most basic practical activity, and it is the thing that determines all other activities. Human understanding mainly depends on material productive activity, gradually understanding the phenomena of nature, the properties of nature, the laws of nature, and the relationship between man and nature; and through productive activity, it also gradually understands certain interrelationships between man and man to varying degrees. All this knowledge cannot be obtained without productive activity."
    Production activities provide topics for the development of science and technology and promote the development of science and technology. The development of science and technology, in turn, promotes the development of production. People observe and accumulate facts from productive labor, summarize experience, analyze and think, and apply the summaries of previous labor experience to develop, in order to further and more fully grasp its regularity.
    Watt's invention of the steam engine was not, as bourgeois historians of science boast, due to Watt's unique insight, suddenly inventing and creating from the steam pushing the lid of a kettle. The invention of the steam engine was first due to the need for new tools and new power in the emerging capitalism. Before Watt, many people had worked hard in this area, and Newcomen was one of the closest to Watt's steam engine. Without the needs of society, this invention would not have received support and development. For example, although the Russian worker-technician Polzunov's steam engine invention was seven or eight years earlier than Watt's, it did not receive any development in serfdom Tsarist Russia. Secondly, there was Watt's personal talent and experience, including his rich experience in repairing steam engines and his spirit of daring to create new things.
    Some may doubt that this is true for inventions in practical technology, but what about "pure" science? We know that strictly speaking, there is no such thing as pure science. It is also determined by productive labor and is also used to promote production. Take the most abstract mathematics as an example. Classical geometry was created because of the need to measure agricultural land and observe astronomy and orientation. Due to the discovery of overseas markets after the 15th century and the development of industry, mining, transportation, and other industries, people's production activities became larger-scale and more complex, and many unsolvable problems were raised in production technology, while also providing many practical results. Newton then invented a mathematical method—calculus—that uses a variational perspective to deal with the problem of material movement.
    Productive labor not only provides topics and materials for science and technology, but it is also the material basis for scientific and technological research. Without the instruments created by productive labor, the development of modern science would be impossible. Without advanced industrial technology, the atomic age would not have been possible. Not to mention that the material and cultural life of the entire society is supported and supplied by productive labor.
    II. The Laboring People Can Most Urgently Feel the Need to Create and Develop Science and Technology
    This principle has become even more obvious since the high tide. Under the call of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the laboring people of our country are striving to catch up with the United Kingdom in industrial production in fifteen years or even less, and to realize the forty-article development outline for agriculture ahead of schedule. They must go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and get rid of poverty and backwardness as soon as possible. This strong desire to build socialism is the driving force for creating and improving technology.
    The laboring people directly participate in production. In their production activities, they all hope to get rid of our country's economic and technological backwardness as soon as possible. To increase production and accelerate development, they will encounter some difficulties. To overcome these difficulties, technology must be reformed. The laboring people are in production all day long, with the richest experience and the most familiar situation, so they can grasp the contradictions that urgently need to be resolved in production technology. This strong desire to strive for the top can force out a spirit of hard work and a spirit of drilling. If they don't understand, they will learn; if they are outsiders, they will drill. This need from the development of production, as Engels put it, can promote the progress of science more than ten universities.
    Many reformers and creators of agricultural tools were still the target of eliminating illiteracy last year. However, seeing that crops are short of water, the waterwheel supply is insufficient, or seeing that there is not enough labor and they are desperately rushing to work, but still cannot adapt to the requirements of cultivation, this forces people to use their brains, not waiting for "foreign" machines, and rushing to make "native" machines. People seek teachers and visit sages, create collectively, and countless creations and improvements have appeared.
    The lofty ambition of building socialism and the urgent requirement of rapid development of productivity make the laborers supervise themselves and pursue technological improvements and inventions and creations as if they are hungry and thirsty. The closer they are to productive labor, the deeper they feel the urgent need for technological revolution and the greater their enthusiasm. This is the most valuable driving force for the development of science and technology. This is a fundamental reason why laborers are the smartest. In the history of science and technology in the world, no era or country has had such a valuable creative driving force as socialist countries.
    The starting point for bourgeois experts in researching science and technology is mostly for personal fame and gain. The extremely bad phenomena exposed during the anti-Rightist struggle, such as "occupying territory," "intimidating outsiders," "speculating," and "avoiding solving production problems," show that the motivation of the Rightist experts is a dirty and corrupt individualism, and what they can "create" is naturally some impractical things that seek fame and reputation.
    If intellectuals want to be smart, they must go to the masses and to productive labor, and become genuine ordinary laborers themselves. Many scientists, experts, and scholars who have done this have already achieved success. If they can do it more thoroughly, they will definitely achieve more success.
    III. Young calves are not afraid of tigers, and those who dare to overthrow idols and are brave in innovation are the smartest.
    In the history of scientific and technological development, we often see that when a certain science and technology reaches a certain stage, it will be full of many prejudices, full of this and that "limit," and people with conservative ideas will stagnate at these limits. "It's not in the books," "foreign countries don't have it," and "authoritative people say it won't work" are their mantras. If people fall into this state of mind, they will worship in front of idols, dare not have the slightest doubt, let alone the slightest movement. These people are often a group of academic tyrants with more "knowledge," divorced from labor, divorced from life, and self-proclaimed authoritative figures. History is merciless, and these people will not become objects of ridicule by later generations, and will not be battered and bruised in the face of truth.
    Workers, peasants, "outsiders," and young people certainly do not have much "knowledge" and have poor conditions, but they are close to production, close to life, and their ideas are relatively materialistic and relatively dialectical. They have a great advantage, that is, young calves are not afraid of tigers, and they are not bound by prejudices and superstitions. They dare to doubt the ancients, doubt foreigners, and dare to overthrow idols. They dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. As long as there is such a need in productive labor, all "authority" and "dogma" cannot be restrained. This fearless spirit of daring to break the old world and build a new world, this fresh and lively thought and action that grows out of breaking through the stagnant academic atmosphere, often contains the young buds of inventions, creations, and major improvements. We often read in the history of science that laborers, "outsiders," and young people who are looked down upon are often able to dare to uphold the truth, speak the truth, and challenge the great men who ruled the throne of science at that time. These young buds are the most vital and unstoppable things. Under the cruel persecution of the old society, even taking physical elimination methods (such as Bruno, who supported the theory of geocentrism, being burned to death by the court), the light of scientific truth cannot be extinguished. Moreover, in liberated China, in China where the laboring people have grasped great power, do we still doubt that these "young calves" cannot capture the fortress of science and technology and cannot throw the science of the capitalist world behind them?
    In these past struggles between the advanced and the conservative, we can cite Darwin as an example. Twenty-two-year-old Darwin began to participate in scientific expeditions to South America, collecting specimens. Five years of travel allowed him to observe traces of biological evolution, and the idea of ​​evolution had already taken shape, but he did not dare to publish the creation "Origin of Species" until he was in his forties or fifties. An unknown naturalist threw a challenge to the entire court and the entire European scientific "authority." A young Huxley firmly supported this truth at the time. A year after the book was published, a debate was held at Oxford University, and Oxford Archbishop Wilberforce determined that Darwin's theory was against the Bible and God. It is an unforgivable thing for a person to recognize apes as their ancestors. However, where is the "authoritative" Bishop Wilberforce now?
    Closer to home, when the Soviet Union first launched the Stakhanov movement, railway experts, professors, and engineers who considered themselves "authorities" brought out thick books and quoted scriptures to prove that the "scientific limit" of freight train speed was 13 to 14 kilometers per hour. However, Stakhanov workers quickly reached 18 to 19 kilometers per hour at that time. Comrade Stalin severely criticized this group of "ideological authorities" in his speech at the first Stakhanov workers' conference.
    Are there too few examples in China today? Li Shimei, who only studied in junior high school for one year, surpassed the international scientific level in termite control; Ma Jingyun, who had only been a car driver and welder, successfully researched and developed friction welding with an internationally advanced level; Farmer Wang Baojing became a researcher at the Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences; A small factory without an engineer manufactured complex tractors. Who can estimate how much creative wisdom the liberated and superstition-breaking laboring people have?

　　为什么劳动者最聪明
　　甘子玉
    建设社会主义的总路线深入人心，技术革命的序幕揭开了，来自劳动群众的创造发明与技术改进，真是百花怒放，生机勃勃。今天报上又公布了一批史料，说明两百多年来科学技术的发明创造，大都出于劳动者和“外行”人之手。这些事实都说明，恰恰是资产阶级大人先生们所看不起的“卑贱者”最聪明，而“高贵者”却是最愚蠢的。
    这些事实，大大地鼓舞了工农群众、老干部、“小”知识分子的志气，广大群众的智慧一经唤醒，向技术革命进军的步伐一定能日行千里，势如破竹。
    事实胜于雄辩，劳动者最聪明的道理，本来是用不着多所说明。但是，近百年来旧中国处在半封建半殖民地的地位，劳动人民备受压迫。革命取得胜利以后，政治上解放了，经济上翻身了，可是在科学文化上，还没有彻底翻身；怕资产阶级专家和教授和对科学技术的迷信，还没有彻底破除。因此，除了摆出事实以外，再摆摆为什么劳动者最聪明的道理，对于破除迷信，也还是有帮助的。
    现在，我们试从下列三个方面，来说明一下这个问题。
    一、劳动实践创造科学
    劳动不但创造了人类、创造了历史，同时也创造了科学文化，这是马克思主义者对待科学文化的基本观点之一。
    科学是人类在生产斗争中对于自然现象的规律的认识。毛主席在“实践论”里指出：“首先，马克思主义者认为人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其它一切活动的东西。人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然的现象、自然的性质、自然的规律性、人和自然的关系；而且经过生产活动，也在各种不同程度上逐渐地认识了人和人的一定的相互关系。一切这些知识，离开生产活动是不能得到的。”
    生产活动提供了科学技术发展的课题，促进科学技术发展。科学技术发展了，又推动生产的发展。人们从生产劳动中观察并积累事实，总结经验，加以分析思考，运用前人劳动经验的总结，加以发展，才能进一步地更多地掌握它的规律性。
    瓦特对蒸汽机的发明，并非如资产阶级科学史家们所渲夸的是由于瓦特独具慧眼，从开水锅盖的被蒸汽推动而忽然发明创造的。蒸汽机的发明，首先是由于当时新兴的资本主义需要新的工具，新的动力。在瓦特以前，已经有过不少人在这方面努力，纽可曼就是其中最接近于瓦特蒸汽机的一个。如果没有社会上的需要，这种发明就得不到支持，得不到发展，比如俄国工人技师波尔祖诺夫的蒸汽机发明虽比瓦特早七、八年，可是在农奴制的帝俄，得不到任何的发展。其次才是瓦特个人的才干和经验，包括他丰富的修理蒸汽机的经验，和勇于创造新事物的精神。
    有人也许怀疑，实用技术上的发明固然如此，可是“纯粹”科学呢？我们知道，严格说来，是没有所谓纯粹科学的。它同样受生产劳动所决定，同时也用来推动生产。就拿最抽象的数学来说，由于需要测量农业用地，观测天文和方位，才产生了古典的几何学。由于十五世纪以后海外市场的发现，工矿交通业的发展，人们的生产活动愈加大规模而复杂，生产技术上提出许多解决不了的课题，同时也提供了不少的实践成果，牛顿才会发明用变异的观点来处理物质运动问题的一种数学方法——微积分学。
    生产劳动不但给科学技术提出课题，提供材料，而且也是科学技术研究的物质基础。没有生产劳动所创造的仪器，就不可能有近代科学的发展。没有高度的工业技术，原子能时代就不可能到来。更不用说，整个社会的物质与文化生活，都是由生产劳动所支持、所供给的了。
    二、劳动人民能够最迫切地感觉到创造与发展科学技术的需要
    这个道理，在高潮以来，就更加明显。我国的劳动人民，在中央和毛主席的号召下，工业生产上要用十五年或者更短时间赶上英国，农业上要提前实现四十条发展纲要，都要鼓足干劲、力争上游，又多、又快、又好、又省地建设社会主义，早日摆脱一穷二白的局面。这种强烈的建设社会主义的愿望，是创造与改进技术的动力。
    劳动人民直接参加生产。他们在生产活动中，都希望尽早摆脱我国在经济上和技术上的落后状态。要增加生产，加速发展，就会遇到一些困难，克服这些
  困难，就必须革新技术。劳动人民整日在生产当中，经验最丰富，情况最熟悉，因此就能抓住生产技术中所迫切需要解决的矛盾。这种强烈的力争上游的愿望，就能够迫出来一股干劲，一股钻劲，不懂就学，外行就钻。这种来自生产发展的需要，正如恩格斯所比喻的，要比十所大学还能推动科学前进。
    许多农具的改革者、创造者，去年还是扫除文盲的对象。可是，眼看着庄稼缺水，水车供应不足，或者是眼看着劳动力不够，拚命抢工，也还不能适应耕作要求，这就迫着人们开动脑筋，不等“洋”机器，赶制“土”机器。人们寻师访贤、集体创作，出现了数不清的创造与改进。
    建设社会主义的雄心壮志，生产力飞速发展的迫切要求，使劳动者自己督促自己，如饥如渴地追求技术改进，追求发明创造。愈接近生产劳动的人，对技术革命的迫切需要，感触最深，劲头最大。这是最可贵的科学技术发展的动力。这是劳动者最聪明的一个根本理由。在世界科学技术历史上，还没有一个时代和国家，像社会主义国家那样具有这么可贵的创造的推动力。
    资产阶级的专家们，研究科学技术的出发点大都是为个人名利。反右派时所揭发出来的“占地盘”“唬外行”“投机取巧”“逃避解决生产问题”等极其恶劣的现象，说明了右派专家们的动力是脏透了的、腐臭了的个人主义，他们所能“创造”的，自然也是一些脱离实际、沽名钓誉的东西。
    知识分子要聪明，就必须到群众中去，到生产劳动中去，自己变成一个货真价实的普通劳动者。不少这样做了的科学家和专家学者，已经取得了成就，如果能够做到更彻底一些，就一定能取得更多的成就。
    三、初生之犊不畏虎，敢于推翻偶像、勇于革新的人是最聪明的。
    在科学技术发展的历史上，我们常常看到，某一门科学技术走到一定的阶段，就会充满着许多成见，充满着这样那样的“极限”，思想保守的人，就会在这些极限上踏步不前。“书本上没有”、“外国没有”、“权威人士说不成”，这都是他们的口头禅。人们如果陷入这种精神状态之中，就会拜倒在偶像的前面，不敢稍有怀疑，更不敢稍有动弹。这种人，往往就是“学问”较多、脱离劳动、脱离生活、自命为权威人士的一群学阀。历史无情，这种人没有不成为后人耻笑的对象的，没有不在真理的面前碰得头破血流的。
    工农群众、“外行”人、年青人，固然是“学问”不多，条件不好，可是，他们接近生产，接近生活，他们的想法是比较唯物的、比较辩证的。他们具有一个极大的优点，那就是初生之犊不畏虎，不受成见、迷信所束缚，他们敢于怀疑古人、怀疑洋人，敢于推翻偶像，他们敢想、敢说、敢作敢为，只要是生产劳动中有这种需要，一切“权威”“教条”是束缚不住的。这种敢于打破旧世界、建立新世界的大无畏精神，这种冲破陈腐窒息的学究空气而生长起来的新鲜活泼的思想与行动，常常蕴藏着发明创造和重大改进的幼芽。我们常常在科学史上读到，被人看不起的劳动者、“外行”人、年青人，往往能够敢于坚持真理，说出真理，和当时统治着科学宝座的大人先生们挑战。这些幼芽，是最有生命力的、不可遏止的东西。在旧社会的残酷迫害下，甚至采取肉体消灭的办法（比如拥护地动学说的白鲁诺被教庭烧死），也不能把科学真理的火光扑灭。何况在解放了的中国，在劳动人民掌握了大权的中国，我们难道还怀疑这些“初生之犊”不能攻占科学技术的堡垒，不能把资本主义世界的科学抛在后面吗？
    在过去这些先进与保守的斗争里，我们可以举达尔文作例子。二十二岁的达尔文，开始参加到南美洲的科学旅行，收集标本，五年的旅行，使他观察到生物进化的痕迹，进化论的思想已经形成，但是“物种原始”这本创作，他到四、五十岁时才敢发表。一个默默无闻的博物学家，向整个教庭、全欧洲的科学“权威”抛出了挑战书。坚决支持这个真理的，当时还有年青的赫胥黎。书出版后一年，在牛津大学开了辩论会，牛津大主教威伯福士判定：达尔文的理论是和圣经、上帝对抗的。一个人认人猿为自己的祖先，是十恶不赦的事情。可是，“权威”的威伯福士主教如今安在？
    再近一点，苏联初开展斯达哈诺夫运动时，自命“权威”的铁道专家、教授、工程师，搬出了厚厚的书本，引经据典地证明货车运行速度的“科学极限”是每小时十三到十四公里，可是，斯达哈诺夫工作者当时很快就达到每小时十八到十九公里了。斯大林同志在第一次斯达哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说里，就狠狠地批评了这群“思想权威”。
    中国当前的例子还嫌少吗？只念过一年初中的李始美，超过了国际上防治白蚁的科学水平；只当过汽车司机和焊工的马景云，研究成功具有国际先进水平的摩擦焊接法；农民王保京成为陕西农业研究所的研究员；一个工程师都没有的小工厂，制造出复杂的拖拉机。又有谁能够估量，解放了的、破除迷信了的劳动人民，有多么大的创造智慧呢？
