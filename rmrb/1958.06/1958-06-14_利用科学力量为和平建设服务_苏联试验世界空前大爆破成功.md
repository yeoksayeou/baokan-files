Xinhua News Agency, 13th: TASS reports: Recently, the Soviet Union, for the purpose of scientific investigation, successfully completed an unprecedented large-scale explosion experiment near Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic. The results of the experiment prove that the power of large-scale explosions can be controlled very accurately, which makes it possible to use the power of explosives to build canals, trenches, dams, and reservoirs according to pre-determined plans.

This explosion was carried out by a joint expedition team composed of the Soviet Mining Research Institute, the Geophysical Research Institute, the Chemical Physics Research Institute, and other scientific institutions near Tagansai, near Tashkent. Before the explosion, thousands of tons of explosives were buried deep underground at the explosion site, and many boreholes were drilled, in which nearly 150 kinds of specialized instruments and equipment were installed to determine the various complex phenomena occurring underground, above ground, and in the air when a large amount of soil was thrown more than 400 meters into the air in a fraction of a second. In addition, sensitive movie cameras were installed at distances of 600 meters, 1,200 meters, and 2,400 meters from the explosion site. More than 60 kilometers of cables were also buried to control the entire set of equipment remotely.

During the explosion, hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of soil were thrown in all directions within a radius of one kilometer in a matter of seconds, forming a large pit 180 meters in diameter and 42 meters deep. The size and depth of the pit formed by this rigorously calculated and astonishingly accurate explosion exactly met the requirements pre-determined by the scientists. The Soviet "Construction Newspaper" pointed out not long ago, when talking about the results of this large-scale explosion experiment, that soon, blasters will be able to use this blasting method to make entire mountains fly into the air and level mountains to the ground.

Currently, Soviet scientific institutions have begun preparing to use the above method to carry out large-scale underwater explosions on the Angara River in Siberia in order to widen the riverbed of the Angara and allow more water to flow into the reservoir of the world's largest Bratsk Hydropower Station under construction, thereby shortening the time required to build the reservoir from five years to three years. According to scientists' calculations, 30,000 tons of explosives will be buried under the riverbed of the Angara River to carry out this underwater explosion.

    利用科学力量为和平建设服务
    苏联试验世界空前大爆破成功
    新华社13日讯 据塔斯社报道：最近，苏联为进行科学考察，在乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干附近成功地完成了一次世界上空前未有的大规模的爆破试验。试验结果证明，大规模爆破的力量是可以控制得非常准确的，这就使得可以利用炸药的力量按照预先拟定的计划来建造运河、壕沟、堤坝和水库。
    这次爆破是由苏联矿业研究所、地球物理研究所、化学物理研究所和其他科学机构组成的联合考察团在塔什干附近的塔干萨伊进行的。爆破以前，在爆破地点很深的地下埋设了上千吨的炸药，并且开凿了许多钻井，井中装有将近一百五十种专门仪器和设备，以确定当炸药在几分之一秒的时间内把大量的泥土抛到四百多公尺高空时、地下地上和空中所发生的各种复杂现象。此外，在距离爆破地点六百公尺、一千二百公尺、二千四百公尺的地方，装设了敏感的电影摄影机。为了远距离控制上述一整套设备，还埋设了六十多公里长的电缆。
    爆破时，在几秒钟时间内就把几十万立方公尺的土抛到方圆一公里的四周去，同时形成了一个直径一百八十公尺、深四十二公尺的大坑。这次经过严格计算和惊人准确的爆破所形成的坑的大小和深度恰好完全符合科学家们预定的要求。苏联“建筑报”不久以前在谈到这次大规模爆破试验的结果时指出，不久以后，爆破手利用这种爆破方法将能够使整个的山飞到空中，使山岳夷为平地。
    目前，苏联的科学机构已经着手准备在西伯利亚安加拉河上用上述方法进行大规模的水底爆破，以便加宽安加拉的河床，使河水能够更大量地流入正在建设的世界上最大的布拉茨克水电站的水库，从而把建成水库所需要的时间从五年缩短到三年。据科学家计算，为了进行这一水底爆破，要在安加拉河河床下埋设三万吨的炸药。
