    Reported by our correspondent Wei Wenhua: Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, and to meet the needs of the technological and cultural revolutions, in addition to continuing to improve existing institutions of higher learning and the state investing in the construction of new institutions, China's higher education is also breaking the mystique of running universities, with localities and the masses starting to vigorously establish institutions of higher learning. From incomplete statistics from April to the end of May, in seventeen provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Guangdong, Jilin, Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Guizhou, Gansu, Hubei, Shanxi, and Beijing, more than 130 new universities and specialized colleges have been established. Most of them are ready, some have already started classes, and some will enroll students during the summer vacation this year; the rest are also actively building schools. This kind of new higher education institution is like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, showing a vigorous development trend, which is a great epoch-making initiative in China's educational history.

    These newly established institutions of higher learning include comprehensive universities, as well as specialized colleges and schools in engineering, agriculture, teacher training, medicine, art, and physical education. The majors offered are all based locally, oriented towards production, and closely integrated with reality. The Liling Agricultural College in Hunan Province, which opened on May 11, initially set up two disciplines: agronomy and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. All courses are offered based on local agricultural production needs and the principles of rapid completion and suitability. The Hainan Branch of the South China Agricultural College, which was established earlier this year, is located in Nada on Hainan Island, and its majors are set up according to the characteristics of local tropical crops, cultivating the currently lacking talents in this area. The Lanzhou Railway Institute in Gansu, which will begin enrolling students this summer, is set up to meet the needs of the development of the railway construction industry in Northwest China, with five departments including railway construction and railway transportation. Many provinces have established teachers' colleges in special districts and even counties to greatly accelerate the training of teachers and meet the urgent needs of the cultural revolution situation; they have also established institutions of higher learning in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy to cultivate higher specialized technical personnel; industrial departments and factory and mining areas are running industrial colleges to train relevant personnel. The academic systems, study years, and teaching methods of these newly established institutions of higher learning are temporarily stipulated according to specific circumstances, and experiences are constantly created and improved in practice; generally, attention is paid to the principle of combining theory with practice and learning with productive labor. The doors of the schools are open to the broad masses of working people, and the students enrolled are mainly high school graduates who have participated in labor and other laborers who have achieved success through self-study and have a considerable level of political and cultural knowledge. The Dongcheng Township Amateur Agricultural University in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, which opened on May 1, has students including labor models who have participated in agricultural production for more than seven years after graduating from high school, and learning models who have worked diligently and persevered in self-study after graduating from junior high school. They study while farming, put forward the slogan of "learning and labor," and "red and expert," and want to complete relevant professional courses at the university level in about three years; many amateur institutions of higher learning enroll middle and primary technicians from government agencies, industrial and agricultural production departments; some newly established institutions of higher learning in Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces have also enrolled a group of workers, village branch secretaries, and agricultural cooperative directors who have achieved success in self-study and have a considerable level to study further and cultivate their own intellectuals of the working class. Some students study full-time at school, and most of them study part-time or in their spare time.

    These newly established institutions of higher learning are located in the special districts, counties, small and medium-sized cities, and even townships, agricultural cooperatives, and factory and mining units of the provinces, changing the situation where institutions of higher learning were excessively concentrated in the past, and making them closer to production practice and the broad masses. Guizhou Province, which originally only had three institutions of higher learning in the provincial capital Guiyang, has established twenty-one institutions of higher learning in special districts, autonomous prefectures, and cities this year. Even the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which has always been culturally underdeveloped, has established two specialized colleges: agriculture and teacher training. Liaoning Province is running more than 20 institutions of higher learning that will enroll students this year or are actively preparing to enroll students next year. In the next two years, all major cities and special districts in the province will have one or several. Some of the new institutions of higher learning in various places are run by the province, special district, and county, some are run by industrial and mining enterprises, and some are run privately. Under the strong leadership of the Party, they are giving full play to local initiative and relying on the strength of the masses, so the schools are run quickly and economically. In Jiangsu Province, where higher education is relatively developed, twelve new institutions of higher learning have emerged in just two days in early June. The first batch of higher education institutions that have applied to be newly built throughout the province this year are being actively prepared or have been completed, reaching 28, far exceeding the original number of 16 institutions of higher learning in the province. Recently, Jiaozuo City, Henan Province, has established a mining college and a medical college in two secondary technical schools; in the ancient village of Tianwangshan, Yuxian County in this province, the masses used 32 stone cave dwellings to set up an agricultural university.

    Party committees at all levels have actively led this cause. When XuShui County, Hebei Province, was running a university, the county party committee first criticized the superstitious thinking of people who did not dare to get involved in running a university, and assigned a secretary to be specifically responsible for planning and arranging, organizing the strength of all parties, and quickly completed the various preparations for building the school. The school opened on May 15. Under the leadership of the provincial party committee, the education department of Guizhou Province criticized the "Guizhou is backward" theory and the sense of inferiority, strived to be the best, and the number of institutions of higher learning it is running this year is equal to seven times the number of existing institutions of higher learning. Jiangxi Province criticized the arguments such as "poor conditions" and "difficulties," and began to assign special personnel in early May to accelerate the preparation for the construction of a university and two colleges, some of which will enroll students during the summer vacation this year. The party secretary of the area where many newly established universities are located serves as the principal. The agricultural college run by the farmers of Dongchongfan Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, is jointly led by Wang Zhenzhong, the secretary of the township party branch, and Lin Shuying, a national silkworm farming model, as the president and vice-president. The local party committee not only leads the politics of the newly established schools, but also provides specific leadership to teaching. They seize the cooperation of the original local schools, so that the old schools support the new schools, and the public schools help the private schools. Many places take the method of "hen laying eggs," and an old school fixedly helps one or several new schools. Some old schools in Guangdong Province, according to the conditions and needs of teachers and equipment, give full play to their potential and set up "satellite" colleges.

    The source of teachers for these newly established colleges and universities is generally: people are drawn from existing institutions of higher learning to provide support, teachers from existing institutions of higher learning and personnel from technical departments and scientific units hold concurrent positions, and cadres who have been transferred to lower levels for labor training are selected. Some newly established schools in Shaanxi and Hubei provinces have even broken the mystery of professors and hired labor models as professors.

    我国教育史上划时代的伟大创举
    地方和群众大办高等学校
    两个月来十七个省市新办大专学校一百三十多所
    本报讯　记者魏文华报道：在党的总路线光辉照耀下适应技术革命和文化革命的需要，我国高等教育除继续提高现有高等院校并由国家投资兴建新的院校外，同时打破办大学的神秘观点，地方和群众也开始大办高等学校。从4月到5月底的不完全统计，在江苏、广东、吉林、湖南、福建、浙江、江西、河南、河北、黑龙江、陕西、辽宁、贵州、甘肃、湖北、山西、北京等十七个省、市，新举办的大学、专科学校达一百三十多所，其中大部分筹备就绪，有的已经开学上课，有的在今年暑假就招生开学；其余的也正在积极建校。这种新的高等学校有如雨后春笋，出现了蓬勃发展的局面，在我国教育史上是划时代的伟大创举。
    这些新办的高等学校，包括综合大学以及工、农、师范、医、艺术、体育等专业学院和专科学校。所设专业都是立足本地，面向生产，密切结合实际。5月11日开学的湖南省醴陵农业专科学校，初步设置农学和畜牧兽医两个学科，所有课程都根据当地农业生产需要和速成适用的原则开设。提前在今年成立的华南农学院海南分院，院址设在海南岛那大，按照当地热带作物的特点设置专业，培养目前缺乏的有关这方面的人材。今年暑假开始招生的甘肃兰州铁道学院，以适应我国大西北铁道建设事业发展的需要，设置铁道建筑、铁道运输等五个系。不少省在专区以至县建立师范专科学校，大量地加速培养师资，满足文化革命形势的迫切要求；设农业、林业、水利等方面的高等学校，培养较高的专门技术人材；工业部门和工厂矿山地区则举办造就有关人材的工业专科学校。这些新办的高等学校，学制、学习年限、教学方法等都按照具体情况暂时规定，在实践中不断创造经验，不断改进；一般注意理论与实践、学习与生产劳动相结合的原则。学校的大门面向广大的劳动人民，招收学生以参加劳动的高中毕业生和其他自学有成绩具有相当政治文化水平的劳动者为主。5月1日开学的吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛乡业余农业大学，学生中有高中毕业后参加农业生产已达七年多的劳动模范、初中毕业后勤耕苦钻坚持自学的学习模范等，他们边耕边学，提出“学习、劳动”、“红透专深”的口号，要在三年左右的时间学完有关的专业课程达到大学水平；不少业余高等学校招收机关干部、工农业生产部门的中级和初级技术人员；河北、陕西等省有的新设立的高等学校还招收了一批自学有成绩具有相当水平的工人、乡支部书记、农业社主任等入学深造，培养工人阶级自己的知识分子。学生在校有的是脱产学习，绝大部分是半工半读或业余学习。
    这些新办的高等学校，分别设在省的专区、县、中小城市以至乡镇、农业社、厂矿单位，改变过去高等学校过份集中的情况，使高等学校更加接近生产实际和广大群众。原来全省只在省会贵阳市有三所高等学校的贵州省，今年在专区、自治州、市设立二十一所高等学校，就连文化一向不发达的黔南布依族苗族自治州，也设立农业和师范两所专科学校。辽宁省兴办在今年招生或积极筹办在明年招生的高等学校有二十多所，今明两年内全省主要城市和专区都将有一所或几所。各地新办的高等学校，有的是省、专区、县举办，有的是工矿企业部门举办，有的是民办，都在党的坚强领导下发挥地方积极性和依靠群众力量，所以学校办得又快又省。高等教育事业比较发达的江苏省，6月初两天中已涌现出十二所新的高等学校，全省各地申请在今年内新建的高等学校，第一批正积极筹建或已建成的达二十八所，远远超过全省原有的十六所高等学校数目。河南省焦作市最近在两个中等技术学校办起一所矿业学院和一所医学院；这个省禹县天王山古寨里，群众利用三十二间石窑洞办起了一所农业大学。
    各地党委积极地领导了这一事业。河北省徐水县办大学，县委首先批判了人们不敢插手办大学的迷信思想，抽出一个书记专门负责筹划安排，组织各方面的力量，很快完成建校的各种准备工作，学校已在5月15日开学上课。贵州省教育部门在省委领导下，批判了“贵州落后论”和自卑感，力争上游，今年举办的高等学校等于现有高等学校的七倍。江西省批判了“条件差”、“有困难”等论调，5月初开始分别指派专人负责，加速筹建一所大学和两所学院，有的在今年暑假就要招生。很多新办大学就由所在地区的党委书记担任校长，湖北省罗田县东冲畈乡农民自办的农学院，由乡党总支书记王振中和全国养蚕模范林淑英分任正副院长。地方党委对新成立的学校，不但领导政治，而且对教学也加以具体领导。对当地原有的学校抓协作，做到老校支援新校，公立学校帮助民办学校，许多地方采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，一个老学校固定帮助一个或几个新学校。广东省有的老学校根据师资、设备等条件和需要，发挥潜力，设立“卫星”学院。
    这些新办大专学校的师资一般的来源是：由现有高等学校抽人支援，现有高等学校教师和技术部门、科学单位的人员兼职，从下放劳动锻炼的干部当中选拔。陕西和湖北等省，有些新办学校更打破教授之谜，聘请劳动模范当教授。
