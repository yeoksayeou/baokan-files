    How can I not be happy!
    The front page of the People's Daily on May 22nd carried the news: Chairman Mao rode in a Dongfeng-brand car, and he said with a smile: "I'm riding in a car made by ourselves!" Recalling the past, in the dark and impoverished old China, not only did we not have our own machine manufacturing industry, but even some domestically produced light industrial products were called "foreign goods." Only nine years have passed since the national liberation, and in this short period, people have ridden in airplanes and cars made by ourselves, used tractors made by ourselves, and watched television sets made by ourselves...
    Recently, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line for building socialism to the people of the whole country. Under the call of this general line, the things we make ourselves will definitely become more and more numerous and better and better. How can this not make me happy!

    怎能叫我不高兴！
    5月22日的人民日报第一版登载着：毛主席乘坐东风牌轿车，他笑着说：“坐了我们自己制造的小汽车了！”回忆过去，黑暗贫弱的旧中国，不但没有自己的机器制造工业，就连一些本国造的轻工业品，也被称为“洋货”。全国解放到现在只有九年，在这短暂的时期内，人们坐了我们自己制造的飞机、汽车，用了我们自己制造的拖拉机，看了我们自己制造的电视机……
    最近党中央和毛主席向全国人民提出了建设社会主义的总路线。在这条总路线的号召下，我们自己制造出的东西一定会越来越多，越来越好。这怎能叫我不高兴！
