    "Advanced" Brand Sedan

    The Chongqing New Construction Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced a sedan.

    This sedan is named "Advanced" brand and has a lot of horsepower, with a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. This factory was originally a very small auto repair shop with outdated equipment. When trial-producing the sedan, they had no blueprints or materials. The workers and technicians designed it themselves with reference to picture album styles. The main components of this car were all manufactured by themselves.

    “先进牌”小轿车
    重庆市新建机器厂试制成功一部小轿车。
    这部小轿车命名“先进”牌，马力很大，每小时最快行驶一百二十公里。这个厂原是很小的一个汽车修配厂，设备都很陈旧，在试制轿车时完全没有图纸资料，工人和技术人员就参考画报样式自己设计，这部车的主要部件都是自己制造的。		  新华社记者  刘诗临摄（附图片）
