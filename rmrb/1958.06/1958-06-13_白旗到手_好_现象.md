    Branch Secretary of Banqiao, don't be discouraged,
    This time being labelled with the big white flag,
    It's not that the white flag ran over by itself,
    It's that your work is not proactive.

    I urge you not to be complacent any longer,
    As long as you work hard and fight desperately,
    The white flag will surely be sent away.

    Receiving the white flag is a good phenomenon,
    Quickly catch up in the areas where you fall short,
    Last time our township raised the white flag;
    All kinds of work transformed.

    白旗到手“好”现象
    板桥支部不要气，这次评上大白旗，不是白旗自动跑，是你们工作不积极。
    劝你们不要再麻痹，只要你们拚命干，白旗定会送出去。
    白旗到手好现象，不足的地方快跟上，前次我乡抬白旗；各项工作都变样。
    （云南保山沙坝支部）
