    Lanzhou to Build Wool Textile Factory
    (By our reporter) Lanzhou is building a wool textile factory. After the factory is completed and put into production next year, it will be able to use the wool produced in Gansu to produce a large number of economical and beautiful woolen cloth, serge, blankets, yarn and plush, and other colorful products. This modern wool textile factory will be forty times larger than the Lanzhou Woolen Mill before liberation. The factory building of the coarse spinning mill alone covers an area of more than 20 mu. In order to give play to the potential of existing equipment, most of the machinery and equipment in the coarse spinning section is old, and all the equipment in the worsted spinning section is domestic.

　　兰州兴建毛纺织厂
    本报讯  兰州兴建一座毛纺织厂。这个厂在明年建成投入生产后，就可以利用甘肃出产的羊毛大量生产经济美观的呢绒、哔叽、毛毯、绒线和长毛绒等各色各样的产品。这座现代化的毛纺织厂将比解放前的兰州制呢厂大四十倍。仅粗纺场的厂房占地面积就达二十多市亩。为发挥现有设备的潜力，粗纺部分的机器设备多数是利用旧的，精纺部分的设备全部是利用国产的。  （刘丰年）
