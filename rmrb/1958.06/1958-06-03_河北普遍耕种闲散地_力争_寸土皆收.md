Xinhua News Agency report: Hebei Province is universally eliminating blank and idle land. As of May 21st, according to incomplete statistics from Handan, Xingtai, Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other regions, more than 887,000 mu have been utilized along canal sides, reservoir sides, ditch sides, field ridges, house sides, fish-scale pits, and contour terraces, planting millet, corn, beans, melons, vegetables, sunflowers, etc.

Last year, Hebei Province cultivated over 1.4 million mu of idle and scattered land, playing a significant role in increasing crop yields and raising the income of commune members. According to estimates by relevant departments this year, due to the increase in canal sides, reservoir sides, ditch sides, and slopes after water conservancy projects were built, along with idle land around villages and threshing grounds, the area is much larger than last year. To ensure "every inch is utilized," all localities have conducted surveys and planning for all idle and scattered land under the slogan "turn waste land into a great leap forward, turn every inch of land into gold," and have organized the masses to sow seeds. According to incomplete statistics from Baoding City and Qingyuan, Lixian, Boye, and other five counties in Baoding Prefecture, 100,000 people have been involved in this activity, and the sowing work on more than 210,000 mu of idle and scattered land has been completed.

    河北普遍耕种闲散地
    力争“寸土皆收”
    据新华社讯  河北省各地普遍消灭空白地和闲散地。到5月21日为止，据邯郸、邢台、天津、保定、唐山、石家庄等专区不完全统计，已利用渠边、水库边、沟边、地埂、宅旁、鱼鳞坑、水平沟等种植谷子、玉米、豆类、瓜菜、向日葵等八十八万七千多亩。
    河北省去年曾种植了一百四十多万亩闲散地，在增加农作物产量，增加社员收入等方面起了很大作用。今年据有关部门估计，由于各地兴修水利后渠边、库边、沟边、坡地增加，连同村边、场头等闲散地比去年增加很多。为保证“寸土皆收”，各地在“废地大翻身、寸土变黄金”的口号下，将所有闲散地进行了调查和规划，组织群众播种。保定专区据保定市和清苑、蠡县、博野等五县不完全统计，有十万人投入这一活动，并已完成二十一万多亩闲散地的播种工作。
