　　Re-examining the Hui Ming Spirit
　　Ge De
　　Since the publication of “Hui Ming and Jia Gui” (April 8th, page 8), some people have misunderstood the meaning of “promoting the Hui Ming spirit and eliminating the remnants of the Jia Gui character.” Some comrades said, “Hui Ming is not worth learning from,” “We have no remnants of the Jia Gui character,” and so on. Naturally, I must take some responsibility for this, as the article was not clear enough.

　　Promoting the Hui Ming spirit, simply put, means promoting a brave spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. It also means promoting the noble style of the working people represented by Hui Ming throughout history. Eliminating the "remnants of the Jia Gui character" means opposing the cowardly and shrinking, subservient slave character remnants of not daring to think, not daring to speak, and not daring to act. It means breaking open the shackles that the old society left on our spirit and carrying out a "spiritual self-liberation."

　　What inspires me most is the heroic spirit of the working people in the Great Leap Forward, their creative innovative actions, and the brilliance released by the great liberation of their minds.

　　Take just one slogan: "Make the Old Man in the Sky Surrender!" What an extraordinary slogan this is. How much authority "the Old Man in the Sky" held in the minds of peasants in the past is something I know deeply because of my peasant background. Not to mention daring to say it out loud, even thinking it secretly was unthinkable, because it was said that heaven would know if you had such a thought, and you would be afraid of retribution. It shows the extent to which the spirit was bound. Now, they have straightened their backs and overthrown this Mount Tai in their minds, demanding that he "surrender." As for the many inventions and creations at the agricultural tool reform exhibition, the many "treasures" from the hands of ordinary working people, and the strange new things that make people feel amazed, they can teach us how great the effect of ideological liberation is, and how urgently it is needed. And this is precisely what first happened in a class that was the most culturally backward. This cannot but turn around and demand that the intellectual class learn this great style from them.

　　Someone once asked: Why take Hui Ming as an example? Why not take the many famous heroes of the past and the current heroes and martyrs as examples? I believe that the heroes and martyrs of the past and present are naturally worthy of great admiration and need to be learned from well. Everyone can write about them, the more the better. And newspapers are reporting and promoting them extensively. As for taking Hui Ming as an example, firstly because he is an ordinary person. Many of the heroes of the past have been mythologized and have become extraordinary and outstanding figures, making them seem admirable but unattainable to the general public. Yue Fei was a great hero, but he had to be said to be a golden-winged roc descending to earth; other heroes were born from dreams of the sun and moon, or the reincarnation of the Thunder God, etc. In a word, they were not of ordinary stock. But Hui Ming was just a genuine fire-cooking monk (and no one has yet investigated his birth and background). When something happened, he suddenly came forward to take on the important task alone, "brave and unashamed," without a trace of "feeling inferior." This is all the more representative of the fearless nature of the working people. Precisely because he is also not today's revolutionary hero and martyr, it can better illustrate that the working people have always had this style, so-called "it has always been so." Today, due to gaining political and ideological liberation, and receiving the leadership and assistance of the working class party, this style of the working people has been greatly promoted. This is enough to kill the arrogance of those who think "workers and peasants have nothing to learn from." It is also enough to make the heroes who think "Hui Ming is not worth learning from" feel inferior.

　　I do not think Hui Ming is our only perfect and flawless positive example from ancient times to the present. I am only taking his humble origins but daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do this point to cheer on our proletarian fighters today.

### 再谈惠明精神

　　再谈惠明精神
　　葛德
    “惠明和贾桂”（4月8日八版）发表以后，引起了一些人的误解：为什么要“提倡惠明精神，肃清贾桂性格的残余”？有的同志说：“惠明不值得学习”，“我们没有贾桂性格的残余”等等。对这，我自然要负些责任，因为文章没有说得十分明白。
    提倡惠明精神，简单地说，就是提倡一种敢想、敢说、敢做的勇敢精神，也就是提倡以惠明为代表的劳动人民自古以来的高尚风格。肃清“贾桂性格的残余”，就是要反对不敢想、不敢说、不敢做的那种萎萎缩缩、甘居下游的奴隶性格的残余，就是要打开旧社会留在我们精神上的枷锁。来一个“精神上的自我解放”。
    给我最大启发的，是劳动人民在大跃进中的那种英雄气魄，是他们创造性的革新行动，是他们思想上的大解放所放出的异彩。
    就以一句口号来说吧：“要叫老天爷举手投降！”这该是多么不简单的一个口号。“老天爷”在过去的农民头脑中该有多大权威，我因出身农家是深深知道这一点的。别说不敢骂出口来，就是暗自想一想也不敢，因为据说心中一动上天就会知道，怕遭报应的。可见精神被束缚到了什么程度。现在居然挺起腰来把精神上的这座泰山推倒，要他“举手投降”了。至于农具改革展览会上的那许许多多的发明创造，那许许多多出自普通劳动人民之手的“宝贝”，那使人感到千奇百怪的新事物，更能教我们明白：思想解放的功用有多么伟大、而它又是多么迫切需要。而正是这一点，却首先发生在从文化上最落后的一个阶层，这便不能不使人反转来要求知识阶层去学习他们这种伟大的风格了。
    有人曾问：为什么要拿惠明作例子？为什么不拿古来的许多鼎鼎大名的英雄和现在的英雄和烈士们作例子？我以为古今的英雄、烈士，自然都是值得十分钦佩，需要很好学习的。人人可写，多多益善。而且报纸上正在连篇累牍地报道宣传。至于以惠明作例，首先因为他是一个平凡的人。古之英雄，有许多已经被人们所神化，而成为非凡和超群的人物了，使一般人看来可敬而不可攀。岳飞是大英雄，但偏偏要被人说成是金翅大鹏降凡；另外的那些英雄们，又多是什么梦日月而生呀，霹雳大仙降凡呀等等，一句话，都并非凡种。而惠明却只是个地地道道的烧火和尚（至今也还没有人查究他的出生和身世），遇事却忽然出来独当大任，“有勇无惭”，没有一毫“自惭形秽”的影子，这就更足以代表劳动人民无所畏惧的本色。正因为他又不是今天的革命英雄和烈士，所以更能说明劳动人民本来就具有这种风格，所谓“古已有之”。今天，由于获得了政治上和思想上的解放，得到了工人阶级政党的领导和帮助，劳动人民的这种风格就更加大大地发扬了。这是足可用来杀一杀那种认为“工人和农民没有什么可学习的”的骄气的。也足可使“惠明不值得学习”的英雄们气短的。
    我并不认为惠明乃是我们从古到今唯一完美无缺的正面典型。只是取其出身卑贱却能敢想敢说敢做这一点，来为我们今天的无产阶级战士们擂鼓助威而已。
