    He Shouli Creates Sleeper Incision Machine
    Can Extend Sleeper Lifespan by Ten Years
    He Shouli, a mechanical foreman at the SanKeshu Sleeper Preservation Plant in Harbin, successfully trial-produced a sleeper incision machine. This incision machine can make 20-millimeter-deep, diagonally dashed-line grooves at certain intervals on all four sides of the sleeper, allowing for the injection of more than 20 millimeters of preservative oil. This will extend the average lifespan of the sleepers to 27 and a half years. In the past, sleepers that were not incised could only be injected with 2 millimeters of preservative oil, resulting in an average lifespan of only 17 and a half years. According to the extended lifespan of the sleepers produced by this plant, the entire plant can save more than 145,000 cubic meters of wood annually.
    Three years ago, after He Shouli heard that sleepers could have their lifespan extended if they were incised before oil injection, he wanted to create a machine that could make incisions, but there was no technical data available for reference regarding what this machine should look like. The factory's Party and administrative leaders encouraged him to break away from the superstition of technology, dare to think and dare to act, and helped him solve the difficulties in manpower and materials. After more than ten experiments, he finally succeeded in creating it.

    何守礼创造枕木刻痕机
    可延长枕木使用年限十年
    哈尔滨三棵树枕木防腐厂的机械工长何守礼试制成功枕木刻痕机。这台刻痕机能够在枕木的四面刻上二十公厘深、相隔一定距离的斜虚线状条痕，注进二十公厘以上的防腐油，枕木使用年限可以平均达到二十七年半。而过去，枕木不经过裂痕，只能注进防腐油二公厘，平均使用年限只有十七年半。按这个厂所产枕木延长使用年限计算，全厂每年能节约木材十四万五千多立方公尺。
    三年前，何守礼听说枕木经过裂痕再注油，能延长使用寿命，就想创造一台能够刻痕的机器，但是这个机器是什么样子，却没有一点技术资料可以参考。工厂党和行政领导鼓励他破除对技术的迷信，敢想敢作，并且帮助他解决人力、物力上的困难，经过十多次试验，终于创造成功。
