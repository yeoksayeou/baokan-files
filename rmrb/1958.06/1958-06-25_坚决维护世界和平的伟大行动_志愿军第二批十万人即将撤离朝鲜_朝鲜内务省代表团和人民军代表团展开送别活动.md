    Great Action to Resolutely Safeguard World Peace
    Second Group of 100,000 Volunteers to Withdraw from Korea
    Delegation from the Korean Ministry of Internal Affairs and People's Army Delegation Launch Farewell Activities
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 24th: Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Withdrawal Communiqué
    The second group of six divisions and other special forces units of the Chinese People's Volunteers, totaling 100,000 people, will begin withdrawing from Korea on July 11, 1958, and will complete the withdrawal before August 20.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 24th: The Delegation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and two delegations of the Korean People's Army, who came to bid farewell to the second group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers, arrived in the middle of June to carry out extensive and in-depth farewell activities. The delegations held grand farewell rallies in the various returning units of the Volunteers. The heads of the delegations delivered farewell speeches at the meetings and presented banners and gifts to the Volunteer units. Representatives from the Korean People's Army delegation, dispatched by the heroic unit that defended the "Heartbreak Ridge" positions, also met with representatives of the youth activists' congress of a certain unit of the Volunteers and visited the "Eight-Year Creation Exhibition" of this unit during the farewell activities. When the Ministry of Internal Affairs delegation bid farewell to a certain unit of the Volunteers, they made a special trip to the Chang Gongli Reservoir to work alongside the Volunteer officers and soldiers. They brought a letter of condolence from Li Yuzi, a nurse at the Korean Central Hospital. The letter described a very moving story of friendship: Li Yuzi worked in a field hospital during the war and once transfused blood to Xie Ping, a wounded Volunteer soldier. Later, the hospital was bombed by American planes, and Li Yuzi was injured. Xie Ping, who had just recovered, transfused blood back to her.
    During the farewell activities, the delegations also laid wreaths at the cemeteries of the Volunteer martyrs. The delegation's performance teams and film projection teams have been organizing song and dance and film evenings for the Volunteer officers and soldiers in recent days. Guests and hosts often enjoyed themselves until late at night, still reluctant to part.

    坚决维护世界和平的伟大行动
    志愿军第二批十万人即将撤离朝鲜
    朝鲜内务省代表团和人民军代表团展开送别活动
    新华社平壤24日电　中国人民志愿军总部撤军公报
    中国人民志愿军第二批六个师及其他特种兵部队共十万人将于1958年7月11日开始撤离朝鲜，8月20日以前撤完。
    新华社平壤24日电　欢送中国人民志愿军第二批归国部队的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内务省代表团和朝鲜人民军的两个代表团，先后在6月中旬来到志愿军归国部队，展开广泛深入的送别活动。代表团在志愿军各归国部队中举行了隆重的送别大会。各代表团团长都分别在会上致送别词，并且向志愿军部队赠送锦旗和礼品。由坚守过“伤心岭”阵地的英雄部队派出的朝鲜人民军代表团的代表们，在送别活动期间还会见了志愿军某部青年积极分子代表大会的代表，参观了这个部队“八年创造展览会”。内务省代表团在志愿军某部送别时，还特地赶到长公里水库和志愿军官兵共同劳动。他们带来了朝鲜中央医院护士李玉子的一封慰问信。信上叙述了一个十分动人的友谊故事：李玉子战时在战地医院工作时，曾把鲜血输给志愿军伤员谢平。后来，医院遭到美机轰炸，李玉子受了伤，刚痊愈的谢平又把鲜血输给了她。
    各代表团在送别活动中，还向志愿军烈士陵园敬献花圈。代表团的演出队和电影放映队连日来为志愿军官兵组织了歌舞、电影晚会。宾主们往往联欢到深夜还在依依话别，难分难舍。
