　　Attending the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party
　　By our correspondent, Li Cheng
    The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party successfully concluded on the afternoon of June 7th.

    At the congress, the resounding pronouncements, "The socialist transformation of Bulgaria has been victoriously completed!" "Bulgaria has shaken off its backwardness and become a socialist industrial and agricultural nation!" were incredibly heartening news of victory! During the conference, which ran from June 2nd to 7th, nearly fifty delegates spoke. They recounted the tremendous changes in various regions during the thirteen years of the people's government, and expressed their determination to advance towards even greater victories. The Pirin Mountains, located in the southwestern corner of Bulgaria, used to be the most backward region, known as "poor land and impoverished people." Valkanov, the First Secretary of the Blagoevgrad District Party Committee from this region, said at the meeting that after Bulgaria's liberation, like all other regions, the sun of freedom also shone on the land of our Pirin region. Now 86% of the cultivated land and more than 91% of the farming households in our district have been collectivized. The Pirin region has become a place of "rich land and wealthy people." Last year, the average daily wage for each laborer in the district was over twenty-seven levs, and the average annual income for each member was six thousand two hundred and seventy-one levs, nearly double that of 1952. Whenever they talk about the increasing income every year, the members say, "Yes, this is the benefit of socialism." The Pirin region is one of the main tobacco-producing areas in Bulgaria. Valkanov said, "This year, the members throughout the district enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party, guaranteeing to supply the state with 18,000 tons of good tobacco. This is an unprecedented miracle…"

    Stoychkov, a tunneling worker and Socialist Labor Hero from the Batak Hydropower Station, Bulgaria's first underground hydropower station in the Rhodope Mountains, recounted the socialist feats and heroic spirit of the tunneling workers at the hydropower station. He said, "In five years, the underground tunnels we have dug are almost equivalent to those dug in seventy years under bourgeois rule. Now, the Vazha River can no longer flow freely, but must obey the commands of the working people; the always turbulent Arda River has been subdued in one place; and the Maritsa River will soon be tamed as well. The achievements we have made should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party. The Party enlightened the people and pointed out the correct direction. In our work, we only have one idea, to tunnel faster, to complete more plans, and to accelerate socialist construction."

    Countless similar achievements in socialist construction confirm the wisdom and correctness of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. At the same time, the congress fully demonstrated the close unity of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people around the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In their speeches, the delegates unanimously agreed with the summary report of the Party Central Committee and the instructions of the Third Five-Year Plan, and unanimously stated that they would unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and devote all their efforts to complete the great tasks set forth by the Seventh Congress of the Party. Each time the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party appeared, the venue immediately resounded with warm applause and cheers of "Long Live the Bulgarian Communist Party!" Every day at the end of the meeting, the citizens of Sofia gathered in groups in front of the venue – the Bulgarian Communist Party Club building – to cheer and salute the delegates. The congress received more than 6,000 congratulatory telegrams and letters from people from all over the country celebrating the convening of the congress.

    In order to defend Marxism-Leninism and to safeguard the socialist achievements that have been made, the congress also fully demonstrated an irreconcilable spirit of struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Many delegates pointed out in their speeches that the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a completely anti-Marxist-Leninist program, that the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia only benefits imperialism, and that a resolute struggle must be waged against modern revisionism represented by the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The heads of the delegations of fraternal parties from the Soviet Union, China, and other countries who were invited to attend the congress all spoke at the meeting. In particular, Khrushchev's speech at the congress, with its severe criticism of modern revisionism represented by the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, was warmly welcomed by the delegates. Whenever he talked about the absurd and anti-Marxist-Leninist arguments of the Yugoslav leadership group, the venue was filled with laughter. When Khrushchev talked about modern revisionism being a Trojan horse, attempting to disintegrate revolutionary parties from within, etc., with a pointed analysis, the venue immediately burst into warm applause, and some delegates excitedly shouted: "Correct!" "Yes!"

    The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which is of great significance in the history of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people, has closed. This was a victorious congress, a congress of unity, and a congress against modern revisionism represented by the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. It pointed out to all the Bulgarian people the bright road to a glorious socialist victory.

　　保共七大旁听记
　　本报记者　李成
    保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会7日下午胜利闭幕了。
    大会上，“保加利亚社会主义改造已胜利完成！”“保加利亚已经摆脱了落后，成为社会主义工业和农业的国家”这些响亮的声音，是多么振奋人心的胜利消息啊！从6月2日到7日的会议期间，近五十名代表在会议上发了言。他们叙述了各地区在人民政权十三年来的巨大变化，表示了向更大胜利进军的决心。位于保加利亚西南角的彼林山区，过去是最落后的一个地区，号称“地薄人穷”。来自这里的代表布拉果耶夫格勒州党委第一书记瓦尔卡罗夫在会上说，保加利亚解放后，像所有地区一样，自由的太阳也照在我们彼林区的土地上了。现在我们州86％的耕地和91％以上的农户已经合作化了。彼林区已成了“地厚人富”的地方。去年全州平均每个劳动日报酬达二十七个列弗以上，每个社员平均一年收入达六千二百七十一列弗，比1952年增加近两倍。每当谈到年年有所增加的收入时，社员们都说：“是啊，这就是社会主义的好处。”彼林区是保加利亚生产烟草的主要产地之一。瓦尔卡罗夫说：“今年全州社员热烈响应党的号召，保证供给国家一万八千吨好烟草。这是从来没有的奇迹……。”
    来自罗多彼山区保加利亚第一个地下水电站——巴塔克水电站的地下隧道掘土工人、社会主义劳动英雄斯托伊奇科夫叙述了水电站地下隧道掘土工人们的社会主义功勋和英雄气魄。他说：“在五年的时间里，我们开凿的地下隧道几乎相当于资产阶级统治时期七十年所开凿的。现在，同乍河已不能畅所欲流，而要听从劳动人民的使唤；向来狂暴不安的阿尔达河已被制服在一个地方；马利卡河很快也要被驯服。我们取得的这些成就都应归功于党领导的正确。党启发了人们，指出了正确方向。在工作中，我们只有一个想法，更快地掘进，更多地完成计划，加快社会主义建设。”
    难以胜数的类似的社会主义建设业迹确证了保共中央领导的英明和正确。同时大会充分显示了保共队伍和全国人民在保共中央周围的紧密团结。代表们在发言中，异口同声地完全赞同党中央的总结报告和第三个五年计划的指示，一致表示将更紧密地团结在党中央周围，用全力来完成党七大提出的伟大任务。每次开会时，保共领导人一出现，会场上立时就响起热烈的掌声和“保加利亚共产党万岁”的欢呼声。每天散会时，索非亚市民们成群结队地聚集在会场——保共俱乐部大楼门前，向代表们欢呼致意。大会收到的各地人民祝贺大会召开的贺电和贺信达六千多份。
    为了捍卫马克思列宁主义，为了维护已取得的社会主义成果，大会还充分显示了对以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义的不调和的斗争精神。许多代表在发言中指出，南共纲领是完全反马克思列宁主义的纲领，南共纲领只有利于帝国主义，必须同以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义进行坚决斗争。应邀出席大会的苏联、中国等国兄弟党的代表团团长，都在会上讲了话，特别是赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲话时，对以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义的严厉批判，受到代表们的热烈欢迎。每当他谈到南共领导集团的荒诞无稽的反马克思列宁主义论点时，会场上总是一片嘲笑声。当赫鲁晓夫谈到现代修正主义是特洛伊木马计，企图从内部瓦解革命政党等一针见血的分析时，会场上立即抱以热烈掌声，有的代表激动地高喊：“正确！”“对呀！”
    在保加利亚人民共和国和保加利亚人民历史上具有重大意义的保共七大闭幕了。这是一个胜利的大会，团结的大会，反对以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义的大会。它向全保加利亚人民指出了向更辉煌的社会主义胜利大进军的光明大道。
