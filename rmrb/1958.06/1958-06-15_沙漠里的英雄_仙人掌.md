    Hero in the Desert - The Cactus
    Song Jun
    In a boundless desert, finding a drop of water is an extremely difficult task. Not to mention human habitation, even other creatures are scarce. Does this mean there is nothing alive in the desert? No, cacti possess a unique, steadfast character. Through a long period of struggle with nature, they have made themselves capable of growing in the desert.

    In the deserts of Mexico in Central America and tropical South Africa, many cacti grow. Like other plants, cacti need water to grow. In order to adapt to the water-scarce external environment, cacti have gradually changed the shape of their bodies. Their stems mostly become thicker, forming a water reservoir. If there is a rainfall, the stem can store a large amount of water to meet the needs of perennial drought. At the same time, in order to reduce water consumption, their leaves are mostly degraded into thorns, reducing the chance of water evaporating in large quantities through the leaves. Cacti do not have green leaves, but they can still perform photosynthesis. This is because their stems are mostly green, which replaces the function of the leaves. In this way, cacti can stand tall in the desert, becoming heroes in the plant kingdom fighting against nature.

    There are many types of cacti, and their shapes also vary greatly. The flowers that bloom are very similar to double-petaled lotus flowers, and come in colors such as white, yellow, pink, red, and purple. The most common are cacti with flat stems; cactus staffs with round and long stems; cactus fists with stems that look like round balls; and cactus mountains with tall stems that look like rockeries. In addition, there are epiphyllum and orchid cacti whose stems look almost like leaves.

    After understanding the character of cacti, cultivation becomes much easier. Because their hometown is in the tropics, they cannot resist low temperatures and cold, so they should be placed in a greenhouse in winter. Usually, watering should not be too much, especially in winter, it is necessary to keep them dry, otherwise they will rot. In addition, we can imagine that the nutrients contained in the desert will not be too much, so it is not necessary to give them too much fertilizer when cultivating cacti.

    沙漠里的英雄——仙人掌
    松筠
    在一片漫无边际的大沙漠里，打算寻找一滴水，简直是一件非常困难的事情，那里不要说人类居住，就连其他生物也是很少的。难道沙漠里就完全没有有生命的东西吗？不，仙人掌类植物独具一种刚毅的性格，它们经过漫长时间的和大自然斗争，使自己能够生长在沙漠里。
    在中美墨西哥和南非洲热带的沙漠里，生长着很多很多的仙人掌类植物。同其他植物一样，仙人掌也需要水才能生长。为了适应缺乏水分的外界环境，仙人掌逐渐地改变了身体的外形。它们的茎多半都变得比较肥胖，成了一种贮水库。如果遇到一次降雨，茎就能把大量的水分贮存起来，以供常年干旱的需要。同时，为了减少水分的消耗，它们的叶子，大都退化变成刺状，减少水分通过叶子大量蒸发掉的机会。仙人掌没有绿色的叶子，但是它照样能进行光合作用。原来它们的茎多半都是绿色的，它代替了叶子的功用。既然如此，仙人掌类植物，就能够挺立在沙漠里，成为植物界中向大自然作斗争的英雄。
    仙人掌类植物的种类很多，而且形状也多变。开的花同重瓣的荷花很相似。有白、黄、粉、红、紫等色。最常见的，有茎长得扁扁的仙人掌；茎长得又圆又长的仙人杖；茎长得像圆球一样的仙人拳；高大的茎长得像一座假山状的仙人山等，另外还有茎长得简直像叶子一样的昙花、令箭荷花等。
    了解了仙人掌类植物的这种性格后，培养起来就方便多了。因为它们的故乡是在热带地方，它们没有能力抵抗低温寒冷，所以冬天应该把它们放进温室里。平常浇水不宜太多，特别是到了冬天，一定要保持干旱，不然就会腐烂。另外我们可以想像到，沙漠里含的养分是不会太多的，因此培养仙人掌类植物，就没有必要给它们太多的肥料。
