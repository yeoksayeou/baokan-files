Loess Plateau Can Also Afforest in All Seasons

    (Our reporter Zhai Qiyin reports) The people of Qin'an County, a national afforestation model county, with their daring and innovative spirit, broke with convention and recently launched a summer afforestation campaign, setting an example of "afforestation in all seasons" on the Loess Plateau of northern China. In the past few years, the county only used the spring and autumn seasons for afforestation, and the progress was slow. Since last winter, inspired by the general line of socialism, the people of the county have successively carried out three afforestation campaigns in winter, spring, and summer, afforesting approximately 800,000 mu, with an average of five mu afforested per laborer. Among them, the winter campaign afforested more than 400,000 mu, and the spring afforestation covered 220,000 mu. Currently, they are completing the summer afforestation task of 170,000 mu. As of now, the county has eleven 10,000-mu forest communes and eighty-five 5,000-mu forest communes, and has won the title of National Afforestation Model County.
    The methods adopted by Qin'an County for planting trees in winter are: (1) inverting the soil, pressing the fertile soil to the roots, and covering the top with barren soil; (2) inserting short poles obliquely, burying them deeply and tamping them firmly; (3) covering the branches with two inches of soil to avoid freezing and drying; (4) planting two seedlings in one nest. In addition to the above methods, summer tree planting also requires cutting, pruning, and planting simultaneously; selecting two- or three-year-old tender branches with abundant water and drought resistance, pruning off the green leaves to avoid water discharge; and watering every five or six days.
    The initiative of "afforestation in all seasons" in Qin'an County is of great significance. Spring and autumn are busy seasons for rural production, coupled with a lack of labor. Solving the problem of planting trees in winter and summer opens up a broad path for large-scale afforestation.

    黄土高原也能四季造林
    本报讯　记者翟其寅报道：全国造林模范县——秦安县人民以敢想敢干的首创精神，打破常规，最近又开展了夏季造林运动，树立了在我国北方黄土高原上“四季造林”的典范。该县过去几年，只利用春秋两季造林，进度缓慢。去年冬季以来，在社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，该县人民先后进行了冬季、春季和夏季三次造林突击运动，共造林约八十万亩，平均每个劳动力造林五亩。其中去冬一次突击造林四十多万亩，春季造林二十二万亩。目前正在完成夏季造林十七万亩的任务。截至现在全县出现的万亩林社有十一个，五千亩林社八十五个，荣获全国造林模范县的称号。
    秦安县冬季栽树采取的办法：（1）土壤倒置，肥土压根，生土盖顶；（2）短杆斜插，深埋踏实；（3）枝头盖土两寸，避免受冻干枯；（4）一窝两苗。夏季栽树，除采取上述几项办法，还要边砍、边剪、边栽；选择水多耐旱的二、三年生的嫩条，剪去绿叶，避免水分排泄；隔五、六天浇水一次。
    秦安县“四季造林”的创举，具有重要意义。春秋两季是农村生产繁忙季节，加之劳动力缺乏，解决了冬夏两季栽树的问题，就开辟了大规模造林的广阔途径。
