    Watching the Chu Opera "Liu Jiemei"

    In terms of subject matter, "Liu Jiemei" is a play reflecting the struggle between two roads in the countryside; if viewed from the perspective of the issues raised by the play and the ideological significance embodied by the character of Liu Jiemei, then it is not just a rural matter. In the great era of entering the socialist revolution, is it to take the socialist road? Or is it to take the capitalist road? Isn't this an extremely important question placed before everyone! Therefore, after watching the Chu Opera "Liu Jiemei," I feel that it not only allows us to vividly see the scenes of this struggle and transformation in the countryside; but even more thought-provoking is what Liu Jiemei's experience tells us. Obviously, the answer to this is related to everyone. The Chu Opera, in the form of opera, through the depiction of Liu Jiemei and his relationship with the people around him, expresses this point quite well.

    For the sake of personal wealth and prosperity, Liu Jiemei, who originally carried the banner of revolution, took the capitalist road after being allocated land and becoming a cadre. Zhou Daqing, who had been beaten by the landlord for him, became his object of exploitation and was almost ruined. Enjoying pleasure, emphasizing extravagance, and being keen on exploitative behavior will naturally be supported and praised by capitalist forces in the countryside—such as Cao Laoqi and Zhu Bade—and will be used by these people. As a result, it not only benefits oneself but greatly benefits capitalism; it not only harms others but also harms socialism. The play vividly reveals the essence of this problem through the relationship between Liu Jiemei, Zhang Xianmei, and the head of the cooperative, Party branch secretary Liu Min'san, the relationship with his father Liu Langcheng, and the relationship with Zhou Daqing, Cao Laoqi, Qi Niang, and Zhu Bade. This is the first thing that audiences feel most strongly.

    The play also has unique insights in the depiction of the character Liu Jiemei. Although his personality is not yet distinct enough, the author firmly grasps a crucial link. That is, when a person's actions are supported by capitalist ideology, he cannot see the truth of anything; he will always reverse right and wrong. Liu Jiemei's so-called "good intentions," "reason," and "protection of farmers' interests" are actually closely linked to the pursuit of personal interests—getting rich. Therefore, he later even bitterly resented the state monopoly of purchase and marketing, saying that cooperativization had harmed the farmers. Why did Liu Jiemei do this? There is always an ideology supporting him in this. The play digs into the depths of his soul on this point and powerfully reveals its harm. I think this is another thing that audiences feel most strongly.

    The Chu Opera "Liu Jiemei" has many moving scenes. For example, the scene depicting Liu Jiemei's transformation, where his father Liu Langcheng brings up the old rags and the new clothes made after liberation, is one example. Holding these clothes, Liu Langcheng and Liu Jiemei seem to be engaged in close combat in their dialogue; "People forget their roots, trees forget their roots, an unsteered boat drifts with the current, capitalism is a dead end, quickly turn back from the vast sea of suffering." A mass chorus; after the crowd exits, only Liu Jiemei is left alone on the stage, his solo singing, and scenes recalling the old society; all are very artistically infectious. This kind of infectiousness embodies the voice of the broad masses of peasants and their true thoughts and feelings. The play and the actors' performances vividly embody this voice and these feelings of the masses, and therefore it has achieved a heart-stirring artistic effect. Therefore, I believe that the singing performance using traditional opera techniques, the way Liu Langcheng handles the clothes, the use of the mass chorus, etc., are all quite successful. Undoubtedly, these are some fresh and beautiful things, which are very gratifying gains in artistic creation.

    The Chu Opera "Liu Jiemei" is not without its shortcomings. For example: Liu Jiemei's transformation is mainly due to the Party's rescue and education of him, and this point has not been vividly and artistically embodied with artistic power; for example: Liu Jiemei's personality and his character development have not been written more prominently; for example: the playwright has not been able to make good use of the traditional opera's screenwriting techniques, etc., all of which make people feel somewhat lacking.

    推荐现代题材戏曲剧目
    看楚剧“刘介梅”
    李啸仓
    从题材上说，“刘介梅”是反映农村中两条道路斗争的戏；如果从剧本所提出的问题、从刘介梅这个人物形象所体现的思想意义来看，那就不仅仅是农村的事了。在进入社会主义革命的伟大时代里，走社会主义的道路？还是走资本主义的道路？难道不是摆在每个人面前的一个极其重要的问题吗！所以，看过楚剧“刘介梅”以后，我觉得它不仅使我们历历如绘地看到农村中这种斗争、变革的情景；而更令人深思的是，刘介梅的经历告诉了我们什么。显然，这个答案是关系到每个人的。楚剧以戏曲形式，通过刘介梅和他与周围人的关系的描写，在这一点上是表现得相当好的。
    为了个人发家致富，本来扛革命大旗的刘介梅，在分得土地当了干部以后，却走上资本主义道路。为他挨过地主毒打的周大青，成了他的剥削对象，几乎被弄得家败人亡。图享受、讲排场、热衷于剥削行为，自然就会受到农村中资本主义势力——如曹老七、朱八爹等一类人物的拥护和捧场，就会被这些人利用。其结果，不仅是利己而是大利于资本主义；不仅是损人，而是有损于社会主义。剧本通过刘介梅、张仙梅与社主任、党支部书记刘敏三的关系，与父亲刘朗成的关系，与周大青、曹老七、七娘、朱八爹的关系，形象地揭示了这个问题的实质。这是使观众感受得最强烈的第一个地方。
    在刘介梅这个人物的描写上，剧本也有独到之处。虽然他的个性还不够鲜明，然而重要的一个环节却是被作者牢牢地抓住了。那就是一个人当被资本主义思想支持着自己行动的时候，他是看不到任何事物的真象的，他会永远颠倒是非。刘介梅的所谓“好心”“有理”和“保护农民利益”，实际上是与追求个人利益——发财致富紧密地联系在一起的。所以后来他甚至于十分怨恨统购统销，说合作化坑了农民。刘介梅为什么要这么做？这当中总有一个思想支持着他。剧本在这一点上挖到了他的灵魂深处，并且也有力地揭示了它的危害性。我觉得这是使观众感受得最强烈的又一个地方。
    楚剧“刘介梅”有不少动人场面。比如描写刘介梅转变，他父亲刘朗成把从前的破烂衣物和解放后所制的新衣等挑上来的一场，就是一例。拿着这些衣物，刘朗成和刘介梅好像短兵相接似的对白；“人忘本、树忘根哟，无舵的小船随水流，资本主义是绝路，茫茫苦海快回头。”一段群众合唱；众人下场后，舞台上只剩下孤零零的一个刘介梅，他的一段独唱，和回想旧社会生活的场面；都是很有艺术感染力的。这种感染力是体现着广大农民群众的心声，和他们真实的思想感情的。剧本和演员的表演正是生动地体现了群众的这种心声、这种感情，因而它才取得了震动人心的艺术效果。所以，我认为这里所运用的戏曲传统表现手法的歌唱表演，刘朗成挑衣服的处理方法，群众合唱的采用等等，都是做得相当成功的。无疑地这是一些新鲜的、美好的东西，是在艺术创造上很可喜的收获。
    楚剧“刘介梅”也不是没有美中不足的地方。如：刘介梅的转变主要由于党对他的挽救和教育，这一点还未能鲜明生动地以艺术的力量体现出来；如：刘介梅的个性和他的性格发展还没有写得更突出；如：在编剧方法上还没能很好地运用传统戏曲的编剧手法等等，就都是使人感到有些欠缺的。
