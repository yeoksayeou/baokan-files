Xinhua News Agency, June 26th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet government, in a memorandum to the U.S. government on June 25th, expressed its hope that the United States would confirm that the Geneva experts' meeting should be subordinate to the task of resolving the universal and immediate cessation of nuclear testing, and that the purpose of this meeting should still be as determined in the exchange of letters between the two governments.

The memorandum pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's claims regarding the experts' meeting essentially aim to turn the experts' meeting into a meaningless one, thereby discrediting it. The memorandum stated: "If the U.S. government genuinely adopts this position, if it is unwilling to have the outcome of the experts' meeting guarantee that countries possessing nuclear weapons will cease testing such weapons, then what is the point of sending experts to participate in the aforementioned meeting?" The Soviet government declared that, under such circumstances, the Soviet Union cannot send experts because it is unwilling to participate in activities that deceive the people.

The Soviet government's memorandum was delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson on the 25th. This memorandum refuted U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks at a press conference on June 17th regarding the role of the experts' meeting.

The memorandum expressed disagreement with Dulles's statement that the convening of the experts' meeting should not "prejudge the question of whether to temporarily abolish testing." The Soviet government pointed out that if the outcome of the experts' meeting does not lead to the ultimate goal—the universal and immediate cessation of experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs—then their entire work will be a futile waste of time. The memorandum said: "Not only that, but there is reason to worry: Under such circumstances, the experts' meeting may even become a tool for deceiving the people, creating a false impression that some steps are being taken to stop the testing of nuclear weapons as soon as possible, while in fact no progress whatsoever is being made."

The memorandum also stated that, based on Dulles's remarks at the press conference, it naturally leads to the conclusion that the suggestion regarding the experts' meeting was made in order to have the Soviet government reject it. When that didn't happen, a trick was played in an attempt to doom the meeting in advance.

The memorandum emphasized that it is precisely the necessity of stopping nuclear weapons testing that is the basis for reaching an agreement on the issue of the experts' meeting, and this agreement has been explicitly affirmed in the relevant documents exchanged between the Soviet and U.S. governments. The U.S. Secretary of State's remarks put forward another proposition, which essentially cancels out the proposition put forward in Eisenhower's letter.

    专家会议如不能促成停止核试验
    苏联将不派遣专家参加会议
    苏联政府向美国政府提出备忘录
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在6月25日给美国政府的备忘录中表示希望美国确认，日内瓦专家会议应当服从于解决普遍立即停止核试验的任务，并且这次会议的目的仍然应当是如两国政府间来往函件中所确定的那样。
    备忘录指出，美国国务卿杜勒斯关于专家会议的主张实质上是要使专家会议成为毫无意义的会议，从而使它威信扫地。备忘录说：“如果美国政府当真采取这种立场，如果它不愿意使专家会议的结果保证拥有核武器的各国停止这种武器的试验，那末何必派专家去参加上述会议呢。”苏联政府声明，在这种情况下，苏联不能派遣专家，因为它不愿意参与欺骗人民的活动。
    苏联政府的备忘录已经在25日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给美国驻苏联大使汤普逊。这份备忘录驳斥了美国国务卿杜勒斯6月17日在记者招待会上所发表的关于专家会议的作用的谈话。
    备忘录表示不同意杜勒斯下面的说法：专家会议的召开不应当“预先决定是否暂时取消试验的问题”。苏联政府指出，如果专家会议的结果不能导致最终的目标——普遍立即停止原子弹和氢弹的试验性爆炸，那么他们的整个工作就会是徒劳无益地浪费时间。备忘录说：“不但如此，而且有理由耽忧：在这种情况下专家会议还可能变成欺骗人民的工具，给人民造成一种假象：似乎正在采取某种步骤来尽快地停止试验核武器，而事实上事情却丝毫没有进展。”
    备忘录还说，根据杜勒斯在记者招待会上的谈话自然而然就得出这样的结论：提出关于专家会议的建议是为了让苏联政府拒绝它。而结果并不是这样，于是就玩弄花样，企图事先就使这次会议归于失败。
    备忘录着重指出，正是停止核武器试验的必要性才是就专家会议问题达成协议的基础，而这个协议已经在苏美两国政府交换的有关文件中明文肯定下来。美国国务卿的谈话中提出了另一种主张，这种主张实质上是取消了艾森豪威尔信件中所提出的主张。
