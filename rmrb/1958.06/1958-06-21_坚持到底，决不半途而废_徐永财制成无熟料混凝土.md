    Persist to the End, Never Give Up Halfway
    Xu Yongcai Makes Cement-Free Concrete
    Xu Yongcai, a veteran worker and Communist Party member from the Northeast Third Engineering Bureau, which is building the Changchun Passenger Car Factory, recently successfully trial-produced cement-free foamed concrete using general building materials and waste materials.
    Foamed concrete is compressive, heat-insulating, and soundproof. It is a building material used for factory and building roofs, and it was previously produced mainly with cement as the primary raw material. Due to insufficient cement supply, the production of foamed concrete was once halted in April. At this time, Xu Yongcai began to use his brains to find substitute materials to produce this product. Based on his twenty years of work experience, he decided to use local building materials and waste materials such as shale powder, fly ash, quicklime, and gypsum to trial-produce cement-free foamed concrete. This bold idea was supported by the Party organization and the workers. Initially, Xu Yongcai failed five times in a row. At this time, he experienced a fierce ideological struggle: should he persist in the trial production or give up halfway? Encouraged by the Party and the workshop workers, he strengthened his confidence and continued to trial-produce it twenty-eight times, making thirty-three formulations, and finally successfully made cement-free foamed concrete.
    The results of the analysis of the first batch of cement-free concrete samples by the Harbin Civil Engineering Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences proved that they fully met the requirements.
    Due to Xu Yongcai's successful trial production of cement-free foamed concrete, not only was the production cost of this building material reduced by 66 yuan per cubic meter, but also more than 1,500 tons of cement could be saved for the country.

    坚持到底，决不半途而废
    徐永财制成无熟料混凝土
    建设长春客车厂的东北第三工程处老工人、共产党员徐永财，最近用一般建筑材料和废料试制成功无熟料泡沫混凝土。
    泡沫混凝土能抗压、保温、隔音，是厂房、楼房房顶上用的建筑材料，过去都是以水泥为主要原料生产。由于水泥供应不足，泡沫混凝土的生产曾在4月间一度停顿。这时徐永财便开动脑筋，寻找代用材料生产这种产品。他根据自己二十年来做工的经验，决定用页岩粉、粉煤灰、生石灰、石膏等地方建筑材料和废料试制无熟料泡沫混凝土。这个大胆的设想得到了党组织和工人的支持。最初，徐永财一连试制五次都失败了。这时，他思想上产生了激烈的斗争：是坚持试制下去还是半途而废？在党和车间工人的鼓励下，他坚定了信心，又接连试制了二十八次，作了三十三个配方，最后终于把无熟料泡沫混凝土制成了。
    第一批无熟料混凝土样品经哈尔滨中国科学院土建研究所化验的结果，证明完全合乎要求。
    由于徐永财试制成功了无熟料泡沫混凝土，不仅使这种建筑材料每立方公尺的生产成本降低了六十六元，而且还可为国家节省一千五百多吨水泥。
