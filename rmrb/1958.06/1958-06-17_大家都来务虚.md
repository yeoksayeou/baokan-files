    Everyone Should Engage in "Wuxu" (Conceptualization)
    Yi Huai
    Whenever "wuxu" is mentioned, some comrades always feel it is a bit elusive, so they treat it as something only for leading organs and leading cadres and don't dare to try it themselves.

    Is "wuxu" really such a mysterious thing? No, this is just scaring yourself. A few days ago, the newspaper published news about the Yanbei area of Shanxi Province, where counties, townships, and communes were all engaging in "wuxu," combining conceptualization with practical work, elevating problems in practical work to the height of theory, thereby grasping the development law of the Great Leap Forward. Reading this news was really exciting. The fact that counties, townships, and communes in the Yanbei area are universally engaging in "wuxu" will encourage those comrades who are scaring themselves to muster the courage and also learn to engage in "wuxu."

    Leading organs and leading cadres naturally need to engage in "wuxu," and general cadres in grassroots organizations also need to engage in "wuxu." Regardless of the type of organization or cadre, as long as they want to do their work better, they need to learn to distinguish whether the thoughts that dominate their own and the actions of their comrades are correct or wrong; whether they are advanced or backward; whether they are bourgeois or proletarian. Then, they must pull out the white flags and plant red flags from their own thoughts and the thoughts of those around them. Only in this way can they do their work well. To do a good job, one must also grasp the objective laws of the development of things, rather than acting blindly; one must be good at accumulating experience, rather than being constrained by one's own narrow experience, and constantly elevate one's experience to a theoretical level of understanding. If you don't engage in "wuxu," what other methods can you use to solve these problems? The Yanbei Prefectural Party Committee decided to let cadres at the county, township, and commune levels all engage in "wuxu" in order to help everyone solve these problems.

    Some people will say that "wuxu" is needed, but is it really possible? We say that whether it is possible depends first on whether you dare. As long as you dare, it is possible! Talking about politics, talking about ideology, and talking about theory are not mysterious, unattainable, or unpredictable things. Theory comes from practice, and political thought exists in people's production activities and class struggles. Any great scholar or great politician, if separated from the people's production struggles and class struggles, would find it difficult to talk about any useful theory or politics. The production struggle and class struggle themselves embody the laws of dialectical materialism. Many grassroots comrades who seem not to talk about theory or philosophy are actually working according to the basic laws of dialectical materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong said: Those who truly know are the people who are practicing in the world. Those people obtain "knowledge" in their practice, which is then conveyed through writing and technology to the hands of the "scholars." In this way, what reason is there to say that the vast number of grassroots cadres and cadres close to the grassroots cannot engage in "wuxu"? Our era is an era where workers and peasants learn philosophy, where workers and peasants reform tools themselves, and also an era where everyone can talk about politics, talk about ideology, and talk about theory. Of course, the theoretical level of general cadres is not high, and it will be difficult to engage in "wuxu." The theories and politics they talk about may be relatively simple and incomplete. However, this does not matter. The theory and politics that come directly from production practice, even if they are not complete, are more vital and combative than those flashy and impractical dogmas. Moreover, as long as we continue to engage in "wuxu," we will improve everyone's political thought and theoretical level, arouse everyone's interest in studying politics and theory, and enable our comrades to become "civil and military" talents who are both practical and have political and theoretical minds!

    大家都来务虚
    易槐
    一提起务虚，有些同志总觉得有点不可捉摸，于是，就把它当成是领导机关和领导干部的事，自己不敢尝试。
    务虚真的就是那么玄妙的事情吗？不是，这只是自己吓唬自已。前几天报纸上登载了山西雁北地区县县乡乡社社务虚、虚实并举，把实际工作中的问题提高到理论高度去认识，由此掌握大跃进的发展规律。这个新闻看了着实叫人兴奋。雁北地区县、乡、社普遍务虚的事实，将会鼓舞那些自己吓唬自己的同志鼓起勇气，也来学习务虚。
    领导机关领导干部自然需要务虚，基层组织一般干部同样也需要务虚。不管他是什么样的组织和干部，只要他们想把工作做得更好，就需要学会分辨支配自己以及周围的同志们的行动的，究竟是正确的思想还是错误的思想；是先进的思想还是落后的思想；是资产阶级思想还是无产阶级思想。然后，从自己以及周围的同志们的思想中拔掉白旗，插上红旗，只有这样，才能把工作做好。要做好工作，还得要掌握事物发展的客观规律，而不盲目行动；要善于积累经验，而不受自己狭隘经验的束缚，不断地把自己的经验提高到理论高度去认识。如果不去务虚，你又能够用什么办法来解决这些问题呢？雁北地委决定让县、乡、社的干部都来务虚，就是要帮助大家解决这些问题。
    有人会说，务虚需要是需要的，可是究竟能不能呢？我们说，能不能，首先要看敢不敢，只要敢，就能！谈政治谈思想谈理论，并不是什么神秘的高不可攀神妙莫测的事情。理论来源于实践，政治思想就存在于人们的生产活动和阶级斗争中。任何一个大学问家大政治家，如果离开了人民群众的生产斗争和阶级斗争，也就很难谈出什么有用的理论和政治来。生产斗争和阶级斗争的本身就体现着辩证唯物主义的规律，很多看起来并不会讲理论讲哲学的基层工作同志，实际上却都是在按照辩证唯物主义的基本规律在工作。毛泽东同志说过：真正亲知的是天下实践着的人，那些人在他们的实践中间取得了“知”，经过文字和技术的传达而到达“秀才”之手。这样说来，有什么理由可以说广大的基层干部以及接近基层的干部就不能务虚呢？我们的时代是工人、农民学哲学，工人、农民自己来改革工具的时代，也是人人都能谈政治谈思想谈理论的时代。当然，一般干部理论水平不高，务起虚来会有困难，他们谈出的理论、政治，可能是比较朴素和不够完整的。但是，这不要紧，直接来自生产实践的理论和政治，纵然不够完整，但是比之那些华而不实的教条却更有生命力和战斗力。而且，只要不断务虚，就会提高大家的政治思想和理论水平，唤起大家学政治学理论的兴趣，使我们的同志都能成为既能实干又有政治理论头脑的“文武”全材！
