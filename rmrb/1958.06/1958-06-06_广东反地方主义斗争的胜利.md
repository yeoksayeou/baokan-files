　　The Victory of the Struggle Against Localism in Guangdong
　　Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　In the rectification movement, the Guangdong Party organization, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the decisions of the Provincial Committee, conducted a systematic and in-depth struggle against localism through the great debate on the historical problems of Guangdong. This struggle has achieved a great victory, and its significance and consequences are extremely significant and far-reaching, fully proving the wisdom of the Central Committee's instructions and the correctness of the measures taken by the Provincial Committee.

　　In the early days of liberation, in order to implement the Central Committee's line and policy of land reform, the Guangdong Party conducted struggles against localism and decentralism in 1952 and 1953. Due to different conditions at the time, localism had not yet developed to the serious extent it later reached. At the same time, without the Party's rectification movement, it was not possible to find the mass line method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. The problem was not completely resolved, and the roots of localism were not eradicated. Therefore, given the right opportunity and suitable temperature, localism re-emerged, revived, and even intensified its activities.

　　The anti-Party activities of localist elements had shown some signs after the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress in 1956, and reached a peak last spring until the great airing of views in May, when rightists launched a major offensive against the Party. Facts revealed that the harm of localism to the Party's cause was far more serious than originally expected. Their methods were very bad, disregarding internal and external considerations, using any means, fabricating facts, concocting evidence, spreading rumors and slanders, engaging in political frame-ups, and even engaging in counter-revolutionary incidents in collusion with counter-revolutionary elements.

　　Localism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology and feudal remnants within the Party. For the Guangdong Party organization, it is impossible to continue to move forward without winning the struggle against localism.

　　Localism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology and feudal remnants within the Party. Localist elements start from extreme individualism, develop into political ambitionists, and even form sinister anti-Party cliques. They use backward regional concepts to engage in sectarianism, cultivate personal power, and attempt to create "independent kingdoms" to resist the leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee. Therefore, localism is fundamentally incompatible with communism, with the Party's principle of unity and centralization, and with the Party spirit of a communist.

　　Our differences with localism are fundamental differences, and our struggle with localism is a struggle between communist ideology and capitalist ideology. Whether to have a thorough democratic revolution, whether to take the socialist road, whether to have the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether to have a unified and centralized Marxist-Leninist party are the crux of this struggle. For the Guangdong Party organization, it is impossible to continue to move forward without winning the struggle against localism.

　　It is now very clear that the root of localism is serious right-leaning in politics and extreme individualism in thought. If those with localist ideas are not vigilant, they will inevitably be used by individualist ambitionists, and even embark on the road of organizing sectarian cliques to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Facts have proved that some people have already embarked on this road, they have become rightists within the Party, and agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party.

　　Localism in Guangdong developed to such a serious extent in a period of time. The reason for this is now not difficult to find in the historical conditions at that time. As the socialist revolution gradually deepened, the domestic class struggle sometimes became sharp, and there must be a corresponding reflection within the Party. This is a turning point in the revolution. Everyone has been tested again. Those who had serious right-leaning ideas and localism during the democratic revolution are now frantically active again, and even want to compete with the Party. This is not surprising at all. Some of them cannot pass the socialist barrier and fall at this last hurdle.

　　The Guangdong Party organization has conducted a serious struggle against localist errors. In order to uphold the principles of the Party, the Provincial Committee and Party organizations at all levels have been engaged in an irreconcilable, tortuous, and complex struggle with localism for several years. Especially in the past two years, the Provincial Committee has spent a lot of energy to solve the problem of localism within the Guangdong Party, and in order to solve the Hainan problem, with the help of the Central Committee, the Provincial Committee and the Hainan District Committee have held countless meetings and made many decisions. The Provincial Committee has shown the greatest tolerance, waiting for the people who have committed localist errors to awaken, but their anti-Party activities have never been seen to be restrained. Now it seems that we have given them too much care, so that the localists have always ignored the Party's advice and criticism to them, disregarded the organization, disregarded Party discipline, and repeatedly forced the Party to engage in endless debates with them, launching constant attacks on the Party.

　　Universally carrying out the great debate on the historical problems of Guangdong within organs and Party organizations above the county level, and making the struggle against localism one of the main contents of the rectification movement, is the most effective way to solve the problem.

　　In order to carry out this debate to the end, thoroughly clarify the major issues of right and wrong in the historical problems of Guangdong, and eliminate the adverse effects of localism, the Provincial Committee made a decision in August last year, and then repeatedly reaffirmed its determination to universally carry out the great debate on the historical problems of Guangdong within organs and Party organizations above the county level, and to strengthen communist education in the struggle against localism, as an important task of the Party on the ideological front, and as one of the main contents of this rectification movement. Facts have proved that this is completely necessary and also the most effective way to solve the problem. Because in Guangdong, the influence of localism is quite widespread, but most people with localist sentiments are blind, unconscious or not completely conscious, and a few localist elements are using this situation to create confusion in the historical problems of Guangdong, confuse right and wrong, spread the poison of localism, and engage in anti-Party conspiracies. Therefore, only through great airing of views, great contending, great debating, and great discussion; through presenting the facts and reasoning, putting the problems to the whole Party for discussion, and allowing Party members and the masses to fully expose and criticize, can we thoroughly clarify the facts, reveal the truth, clarify the confusion, distinguish right from wrong, and achieve the purpose of fundamentally raising the communist awareness of Party members and eliminating the poison of localism. The result is exactly this, adopting this mass line method, the more fully the exposure and criticism of localism, the more profound the education received by the masses, and the problems that have not been resolved for several years have been completely resolved this time.

　　In the process of carrying out the great debate on the historical problems of Guangdong, we adhered to the principle of ideological education as the main focus, and adopted different policies for people who have committed localist errors according to different circumstances. For the majority who liberally echoed localist remarks due to their low level, as well as those who generally have localist ideas and sentiments and have not engaged in non-organizational activities, the main thing is to raise their ideological understanding. As long as they consciously conduct self-examination, draw a clear line with localism, and firmly stand on the side of the Party, they will generally not be subject to organizational punishment. For the minority who have serious localist ideas and even engage in non-organizational anti-Party activities, their erroneous words and deeds should be strictly criticized. If they truly recognize their mistakes, deeply examine themselves, and thoroughly reform, the principle of strict ideological criticism and lenient organizational treatment will also be adopted. For the individual whose mistakes are extremely serious and who do not repent, they must be disciplined and severely dealt with in order to educate the whole Party. It should be pointed out that the great debate on the historical problems of Guangdong contains two types of contradictions. This struggle is basically a contradiction of an internal nature within the Party, because the contradiction between most people who have committed localist errors and the Party is still a contradiction of an internal nature; however, a very small number of rightist elements within the Party are engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies under the cover of localism, and their contradiction with the Party is a contradiction of an external nature, that is, a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. Only by correctly distinguishing and not being afraid to expose these two types of contradictions can we achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong, distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, and thoroughly eradicating localism.

　　The struggle against localism in the Guangdong Party has achieved great victories, the relationship between outside cadres and local cadres has been fundamentally improved, and a new high tide of great leap forward has appeared in the work of the province.

　　In the past six months, through the efforts of the whole Party, the struggle against localism in the Guangdong Party has achieved great victories. The communist awareness of Party members has been significantly improved, the harm of localism has been recognized by many people, localism has really become infamous, lost its market in the Party, and is despised by everyone. The struggle against localism has saved a large number of cadres who have been poisoned by localism, enabling them to stand on the correct position of the Party again; it has also ferreted out a small number of localist rightist elements within the Party, purifying the Party ranks, which is a great organizational gain. After the anti-localism struggle, the relationship between outside cadres and local cadres has been fundamentally improved, especially in areas and departments where this relationship was not good. In the past, local and outside cadres were two separate forces, but now there is an atmosphere of close unity and working together, and the enthusiasm and initiative for work are unprecedentedly high. The Party's discipline, which was damaged by localism, has been rectified and strengthened, the vital forces within the Party that were suppressed by localism have become active, the political enthusiasm and initiative of Party members have been greatly improved, and various unhealthy trends such as competing for fame and position and demanding treatment have been suppressed. A situation in which there is both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual comfort, and lively and vigorous atmosphere is beginning to appear within the Party. What is particularly gratifying is that after the anti-localism struggle, the unity of the Guangdong Party organization and the unified leadership with the Provincial Committee as the core have been further strengthened. On the basis of the anti-localism and in-depth mass rectification movement, a new high tide of great leap forward has appeared in the work of the province. The work of the Hainan District Committee, the Hepu Prefectural Committee, and the Shaoguan Prefectural Committee, etc., has undergone obvious changes and progress after resolutely overcoming localism and adjusting the Party's leadership.

　　Drawing lessons, safeguarding the unity of the Party, strengthening communist education, and thoroughly discrediting individualism within the Party, so that everyone resists and despises it, can fundamentally eliminate localism.

　　The anti-localism struggle is an extremely vivid and profound Marxist-Leninist education for the Guangdong Party organization, and each of us should seriously draw lessons from this struggle. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always warned us to be vigilant against all erroneous tendencies such as sectarianism, localism, and departmentalism, to prevent complacency, exaggerating personal roles, and the dangerous tendency to regard the areas and departments under one's leadership as personal capital and independent kingdoms, and have repeatedly emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity, centralization, and obedience to the leadership of the Central Committee of the whole Party. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party sounded the alarm to the whole Party, especially senior cadres, pointing out that "the unity of the Party is the life of the Party, is the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, and destroying the unity of the Party is violating the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, and is helping the enemy to harm the life of the Party." Therefore, protecting the unity and unification of the Party, safeguarding the Party's democratic centralism and iron discipline is the sacred duty of every Party member. Localism is a major enemy of the Party's unity and unification, and a major enemy of communism, and everyone should deeply hate and despise it. Tolerance, concessions, liberalism, and conciliatory attitudes toward localism, sectarianism, and all non-organizational activities will inevitably bring serious consequences to the Party, making the Party fall into division and disintegration, lose its combat effectiveness, and causing great losses to the Party's cause.

　　Strengthening communist education and raising the Marxist-Leninist awareness of Party members is a powerful antiseptic for eradicating localism, sectarianism, feudal regional views, and resisting the attacks of all non-proletarian ideologies. The spread and even the proliferation of localism are often caused by the blindness and lack of consciousness of Party members' thinking. Through the rectification movement and practical struggle, helping Party members to master the dialectical materialism and historical materialism worldview and methodology, eliminate narrow regional concepts, eliminate personal worship, recognize the harm of localism, strengthen the unity of local cadres and outside cadres, strengthen organizational concepts and discipline concepts, and constantly improve the communist awareness, so that all Party members gradually become communistized, which is the long-term task of the Party, and also a reliable guarantee for fundamentally overcoming localism and eliminating the influence of localism.

　　Bourgeois individualism must be resolutely opposed, especially the individualism of senior cadres should be especially vigilant. The facts revealed in Guangdong prove that all those who engage in localism can be said to have individualism as their root. The greater the individualism, the greater the localism they engage in, and those who have the conditions will develop into individualist ambitionists and become the heads of localist anti-Party cliques. Obviously, with individualism, there is no communism, the more individualism, the less communism. Insisting on individualism, if you do not commit this error, you will commit that error. Individualism must be thoroughly discredited within the Party, despised by everyone, and resisted by everyone. In this way, localism will have no support and will not be able to continue to harm. Therefore, every Party member must not relax the struggle against individualism at all times, especially senior cadres of the Party, should cherish their history, regard the interests of the Party's unity as higher than everything, work diligently and conscientiously, and never degenerate from a communist who is full of enthusiasm and diligently serves the people into a despicable bourgeois individualist ambitionist.

　　Loose Party discipline and unsound organizational life are also a breeding ground for localist activities. Therefore, the Party's democratic life and the Party's discipline must be strengthened, a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralization must be unified, criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, and all non-organizational activities must be prohibited. Every Party member must place himself under the management of Party organizations at all levels, accept the strict supervision of Party organizations, and conscientiously abide by Party discipline. This is one of the important conditions for Party members to avoid making mistakes or reduce making mistakes.

　　In the past few years, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and the successive movements led by the Provincial Committee have been correct, and the work of the province has achieved great results. The unity of the Party in the province is basically good, and the relationship between outside cadres and local cadres is basically united. After the rectification movement and the anti-localism struggle, the unity and unification of the whole Party will be further consolidated, the unity of outside cadres and local cadres will be further strengthened, and the work of the province will achieve a new and more rapid development. This is completely predictable. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province are confidently marching forward to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way to realize the Party's general line.

　　广东反地方主义斗争的胜利
　　中共广东省委书记处书记　区梦觉
    在整风运动中，广东党组织按照中央的指示和省委的决定，通过关于广东历史问题的大辩论，系统地深入地开展了反对地方主义的斗争。这个斗争取得了巨大的胜利，它的意义和后果是十分重大十分深远的，完全证明了中央指示的英明和省委所采取的措施的正确。
    解放初期，为了贯彻执行中央的土地改革的方针路线，在1952年和1953年，广东党内曾经进行过反对地方主义和反对分散主义的斗争。由于当时条件不同，地方主义还没有发展到像后来那样严重的地步，同时，没有全党的整风运动，还不可能找到大鸣大放大辩论的群众路线的方法，问题没有彻底解决，地方主义的根子没有铲除掉。因此遇到适当时机，温度适宜，地方主义就又重新露头，死灰复燃，甚至变本加厉地活动起来。
    地方主义分子的反党活动，在1956年广东省党代表大会后已看到一点迹象，而去年春天直到5月大鸣大放，右派分子向党大举进攻时达到了高峰。从揭露的事实看，地方主义对党的事业的危害，其严重程度远远超出原来的预料之外。他们活动的手法非常恶劣，不分内外，不择手段，捏造事实，虚构罪证，散布流言蜚语，造谣中伤，进行政治陷害，甚至发生和反革命分子勾结在一起闹事的反革命事件。
    地方主义是资产阶级思想和封建残余思想在党内的一种反映。对于广东党组织来说，不取得反地方主义斗争的胜利，就不可能继续向前迈进。
    地方主义是资产阶级思想和封建残余思想在党内的一种反映。地方主义分子是从极端个人主义出发，发展为政治野心家，以至结成罪恶的反党集团。他们利用落后的地域观念，进行宗派拉拢，培植私人势力，企图造成“独立王国”，以对抗中央和省委的领导。因此，地方主义和共产主义根本不相容，和党的统一集中原则，和共产党员的党性根本不相容。
    我们同地方主义的分歧，是根本性的分歧，我们同地方主义的斗争，是共产主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争。要不要彻底的民主革命，要不要走社会主义道路，要不要无产阶级专政，要不要统一集中的马列主义的党，这就是这场斗争的癥结所在。对于广东党组织来说，不取得反地方主义斗争的胜利，我们就不可能继续向前迈进。
    现在看得很清楚，地方主义的根子是政治上的严重右倾和思想上的极端个人主义。有地方主义思想的人如果不警惕，发展下去就必然要为个人主义野心家所利用，甚至走上组织宗派小集团进行反党反社会主义的道路。事实证明，现在有一些人已经走上了这条道路，他们已经成为党内的右派分子，成为资产阶级在党内的代理人。
    广东的地方主义在一个时期发展到这样严重的地步，这个原因现在不难从当时的历史条件中找到。社会主义革命逐步深入，国内阶级斗争有时尖锐起来，在党内也一定会有相应的反映。这是革命的转折点。每个人都受到了再一次的考验。在民主革命时期具有严重右倾思想和地方主义的人，现在又猖狂地活动起来，甚至要和党较量一下，这是一点也不奇怪的。他们中间有些人过不了社会主义关，在最后这道关口上摔下来了。
    广东党组织对于地方主义错误进行了严肃的斗争。为了维护党的原则，几年来省委和各级党组织一直同地方主义作着不调和的、曲折的、复杂的斗争。尤其是最近两年，省委曾经花了很大的精力去解决广东党内的地方主义问题，而为了解决海南问题，在中央帮助下，省委和海南区党委更不知召开了多少次会议，作过多少决定。省委仁至义尽地以最大的容忍等待着犯地方主义错误的人的觉悟，但是他们反党活动始终未见有所敛迹。现在看来，我们对他们的照顾显然多了些，以至地方主义者始终无视党对于他们的忠告和批评，目无组织，目无党纪，并一再压迫党同他们进行无休止的争论，向党发动不断的攻击。
    在全省县以上机关和党组织内普遍开展广东历史问题的大辩论，把反对地方主义的斗争作为整风运动的主要内容之一，是解决问题的最有效的方法。
    为了把这场争论进行到底，彻底弄清广东历史问题上的大是大非，清除地方主义的恶劣影响，去年8月省委作了决定，以后又几次重申决心，在全省县以上机关和党组织内普遍开展广东历史问题的大辩论，把反对地方主义的斗争，加强共产主义的教育，作为党在思想战线上的一项重要任务，作为这次整风运动的主要内容之一。事实证明，这样做是完全必要的，也是解决问题的最有效的方法。因为在广东，地方主义的影响相当广泛，但是大多数具有地方主义情绪的人是盲目的，不自觉或不完全自觉的，而少数地方主义分子正是利用这种情况，在广东历史问题上制造混乱，混淆是非，散播地方主义的毒素，进行反党的阴谋活动。因此，只有通过大鸣、大放、大争、大辩；通过摆事实、讲道理，把问题拿到全党来讨论，让党员群众进行充分的揭发批判，才能彻底弄清事实，揭露真相，澄清混乱，辨明是非，达到从根本上提高党员的共产主义觉悟，清除地方主义毒害的目的。结果也正是这样，采取这种群众路线的方法，对地方主义的揭露批判越充分，群众受到的教育就越深刻，几年来未能解决的问题这次得到了彻底的解决。
    在开展广东历史问题大辩论过程中，我们坚持了思想教育为主的原则，对于犯有地方主义错误的人区别不同的情况，采取不同的方针。对于多数由于水平低，自由主义地附和地方主义的言论，以及一般有地方主义思想情绪，没有进行非组织活动的人，主要是提高他们的思想认识，只要他们自觉的进行检查，和地方主义划清界限，坚决站到党的方面来，一般均不作组织处分。对于少数有严重的地方主义思想甚至进行非组织的反党活动的人，则应当对他们的错误言行展开严格的批判，如果他们真正认识错误，深刻检讨，痛改前非，也采用思想批判从严，组织处理从宽的原则；而对于其中个别错误极为严重又不悔改的人，则必须绳之以纪律，严肃处理，用以教育全党。应当指出，广东历史问题大辩论，包含有两种性质的矛盾。这个斗争基本上是属于党内性质的，因为大多数犯有地方主义错误的人，他们同党的矛盾仍属内部是非性质的矛盾；但是极少数的党内右派分子，他们在地方主义的掩护下进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，他们同党的矛盾则是属于外部性质的矛盾，即敌我矛盾。正确区分而又不害怕揭露这两种性质的矛盾，才能达到明辨是非，分清敌我，和彻底根除地方主义的目的。
    广东党内反对地方主义的斗争已经取得了很大的胜利，外来干部和本地干部的关系有了根本改善，全省的工作出现了一个新的大跃进的高潮。
    半年来，经过全党的努力，广东党内反对地方主义的斗争已经取得了很大的胜利。党员的共产主义觉悟有了显著的提高，地方主义的危害性已被许多人所认识，地方主义真的搞臭了，在党内丧失了市场，而为大家所不齿。反对地方主义的斗争，挽救了一大批受到地方主义毒害的干部，使他们重新站到党的正确立场上来；也揪出少数党内地方主义右派分子，纯洁了党的队伍，这是组织上的大收获。经过反地方主义斗争，外来干部和本地干部的关系有了根本改善，特别是在这种关系搞得不好的地区和部门，过去本地、外来是两股劲，现在出现了彼此亲密团结一起干的气象，工作热情和积极性空前高涨，劲头特别大。为地方主义所破坏的党的纪律整饬和加强起来，在地方主义压抑下的党内有生力量活跃起来，党员的政治热情和主动性大为提高，争名位、闹待遇等各种歪风邪气被打了下去，党内开始出现一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅，生动活泼的局面。特别值得庆幸的是，经过反地方主义斗争以后，广东党组织的团结和以省委为核心的统一领导达到了进一步加强，全省的工作在反地方主义和深入全民整风运动的基础上，出现了一个新的大跃进的高潮。像海南区党委、合浦地委、韶关地委等，坚决克服了地方主义，调整了党的领导之后，工作都有明显的转变和进步。
    吸取教训，维护党的团结，加强共产主义教育，把个人主义在党内彻底搞臭，作到人人抵制，个个鄙视，就能够从根本上铲除地方主义。
    反地方主义的斗争，对于广东党组织，是一次极其生动和深刻的马克思列宁主义教育，我们每个人应当从这个斗争中认真吸取教训。党中央和毛主席历来都告诫我们，要警惕一切宗派主义、地方主义、本位主义等错误倾向，要防止骄傲情绪，夸大个人作用，把自己领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国的危险倾向，并一再强调加强全党的统一性、集中性和服从中央领导的重要性。党的七届四中全会决议更向全党特别是高级干部敲响了警钟，指出“党的团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则，破坏党的团结就是违反马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是帮助敌人来危害党的生命”。因此，保护党的团结统一、维护党的民主集中制和铁的纪律，这是每个党员的神圣职责。地方主义是党的团结统一的大敌，是共产主义的大敌，每个人应当深恶而痛绝之。对地方主义、宗派主义和一切非组织活动的容忍、让步、自由主义和调和态度，都必然要给党带来严重的后果，使党陷于分裂瓦解，丧失战斗力，使党的事业受到巨大的损失。
    加强共产主义教育，提高党员的马克思列宁主义觉悟水平，这是根除地方主义、宗派主义、封建地域观点，抵御一切非无产阶级思想意识的进攻的有力防腐剂。地方主义的传播以至泛滥，往往是以党员思想存在的盲目性，缺乏自觉性为条件而造成的。通过整风运动与实际斗争，帮助党员掌握辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观和思想方法，消除狭隘的地域观念，去掉个人崇拜，认识地方主义的危害性，密切本地干部和外来干部的团结，加强组织观念和纪律观念，不断提高共产主义的觉悟程度，使全体党员逐步共产主义化，这是党的长期任务，也是从根本上克服地方主义，杜绝地方主义影响的可靠保证。
    资产阶级个人主义必须坚决反对，特别是高级干部的个人主义尤应注意警惕。从广东揭发出来的事实证明，所有闹地方主义的人，他们的根子可以说都是个人主义在作怪，个人主义越大，闹的地方主义就越大，有条件的就会发展成为个人主义野心家，成为地方主义反党集团的头子。很明显，有了个人主义，就没有共产主义，个人主义愈多，共产主义就愈少。坚持个人主义，不犯这种错误也要犯那种错误。个人主义在党内必须把它彻底搞臭，人人鄙视，个个抵制，这样，地方主义就没有了依托，就不能继续为害。因此每个党员时刻都不能放松对于个人主义的斗争，尤其是党的高级干部，更应当珍惜自己的历史，把党的团结的利益看作高于一切，兢兢业业做好工作，绝不要由满腔热忱、勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的共产党员，堕落为卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义的野心家。
    党内纪律松懈，组织生活不健全，也是便利地方主义活动的温床。因此，党的民主生活和党的纪律必须加强，高度民主和高度集中必须统一，批评和自我批评必须开展，一切非组织活动必须禁止。每个党员都必须把自己置于各级党组织的管理之下，接受党组织的严格监督，认真遵守党的纪律，这是使党员避免犯错误或减少犯错误的重要条件之一。
    几年来，在党中央直接领导下，广东省委的领导和省委领导的历次运动是正确的，全省的工作获得了巨大的成绩。全省党的团结的情况基本上是好的，外来干部和本地干部的关系基本上是团结的。经过整风运动和反地方主义斗争，全党的团结统一将进一步巩固，外来干部和本地干部的团结将进一步加强，全省的工作将获得一个新的更迅速的发展，这是完全可以预期的。全省人民在党的领导下，正满怀信心地为提前实现全国农业发展纲要，为实现党的总路线，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义而豪迈地前进。
