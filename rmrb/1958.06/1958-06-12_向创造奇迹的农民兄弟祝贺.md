Editorial: Congratulating the Farmer Brothers Who Create Miracles

　　"Selling grain with baskets the year before last,
　　Selling grain by boat last year,
　　This year, cars can't load it all,
　　Next year, even trains will be too small."
　　Dear readers, when you read this heroic folk song of the farmers of Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi on page 8 of this newspaper a few days ago, you may have thought: This is a romantic work, how can grain increase so much and so fast? However, the era we are in today is so full of revolutionary romanticism! What had been regarded as beautiful fantasies and myths for centuries has now become a reality one by one! What people are singing is what has already been achieved or will soon be achieved.
　　In recent days, news of high-yield wheat harvests has been pouring in from all over the country. What exciting news this is! Those who have put in countless efforts and sweat for the happiness of 600 million people, who can not be ecstatic for such a great victory! Look, after prediction, the 2,200 mu of wheat in the Pidong No. 1 Cooperative in Liu'an County, Anhui Province, can reach an average yield of 800 jin per mu. Among them, 28 mu can reach more than 1,000 jin per mu. The 676 mu of wheat in the Limin Cooperative in Ningjin County, Hebei Province, is estimated to yield 700 jin per mu. In Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, there are places with wheat yields of 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin per mu. In the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Guanghua County of the province, 11 mu of wheat actually yielded 3,215 jin per mu. These yield figures are many times higher than the general yield, but this is not the national record this year! According to the news received as of today, the national record appeared in the Weixing Agricultural Cooperative in Suiping County, Henan Province. There, 2.9 mu of wheat yielded 3,530 jin and 7.5 liang per mu. This seems like just an ideal. But it is not, it is reality! This is the real thing already in hand!
　　At the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the report he made on behalf of the Party Central Committee: "We have more than 600 million people, and our Party has formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with these more than 600 million people. Relying on this great force, we can do whatever human beings can do, or we can do it very quickly. There is nothing we cannot do." A yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu is a yield that was difficult for predecessors to imagine. But now we have done it.
　　The Party Central Committee has repeatedly called on us to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and not to underestimate ourselves or be dejected. These many high-yield wheat records prove that as long as we think about it and do it, we will get a rich harvest. What should those who are still "watching the tide" and waiting for "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" think now? Let us advise them: do not doubt and wait any longer, hurry up and cheer up, and move forward with the times and with the masses!
　　Today's great achievements are not a gift from heaven, but are created by the hardworking and courageous hands of our people. Under our superior social system, under the leadership of our Party Central Committee armed with Marxism-Leninism, the wisdom and talent of the Chinese people can be transformed into endless power. As long as we earnestly mobilize the masses and wholeheartedly rely on the masses, our country can create unprecedented miracles. This is true of wheat production, and it is true of any other undertaking.
　　More than 2,000 years ago, our ancient sages and wise men had the great ideal of "exhausting the benefits of the land," that is, giving full play to land productivity. Now, in our country, the era of giving full play to land productivity has arrived. Hasn't the old idea that wheat can only have low yields and cannot have high yields been broken by living facts? This year, perhaps we only have more than ten mu of land that has reached a yield of 3,000 jin per mu, but next year, we may have thousands or tens of thousands of such ten mu. This is by no means a fantasy! "The development of social productive forces requires socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds; the victory of socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds, in turn, promote the leap forward of social productive forces; this leap forward of productive forces, in turn, continues to stimulate the improvement of socialist relations of production and the advancement of people's thinking. In the continuous struggle to transform nature, people constantly transform society and transform themselves." (Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress). Today's high-yield wheat record has liberated people's minds from the superstition that "wheat is a low-yield crop." One step forward in people's thinking will inevitably promote another step forward in things. What a tremendous power will the ideological leap of 500 million farmers produce!
　　In our society, any creation, any miracle, no matter where it appears, will soon become the wealth of the whole society. We have seen that relevant departments from the Central Committee to relevant leading comrades and agricultural scientists in Hubei Province have rushed to the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Guanghua County to conduct on-the-spot observation and research and summarize experience. We must promote this experience to the whole country and set off a nationwide upsurge in wheat production to catch up with the advanced. In areas where such high yields have not yet appeared, do not think that miracles can only be created on particularly fertile land. As long as we are good at absorbing advanced experience, miracles can be created anywhere. The experience of Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province proves that all kinds of regions, including mountain slopes and dry land, can strive for high-yield harvests. Most of the high-yield wheat records of more than 1,000 jin in more than 200 mu of 22 cooperatives in Zaoyang County appeared on barren ridges that have always had yields of only more than 100 jin. Zhuxi County is a famous large mountainous area, but the Minzhu Cooperative in Zuoxi Township of this county has 12.2 mu of wheat with an average yield of 2,019 jin per mu. "There is no bad land, only bad farming," this sentence is always true. In front of our more than 500 million intelligent and courageous farmers, what kind of barren land cannot be turned into fertile farmland? Everything is created by labor, and fertile fields are also created by labor! We believe that the labor and wisdom of the people will make endless contributions to our country's socialist cause.
　　Let me congratulate the farmer brothers who create miracles, and wish them continuous and greater victories!

### 向创造奇迹的农民兄弟祝贺

    向创造奇迹的农民兄弟祝贺
    “前年卖粮用箩挑，
    去年卖粮用船摇，
    今年汽车装不了，
    明年火车还嫌小。”
    亲爱的读者，当你前些日子在本报第八版上读到江西井冈山农民的这首豪迈的民歌的时候，你也许会想：这是浪漫主义的作品，粮食怎么能增加得那么多那么快呢？可是，我们今天所处的这个时代就是这样富于革命的浪漫主义的色彩！多少世纪以来一直被当做美丽的幻想和神话的东西，于今一桩桩地变成了现实！人们歌唱着的，就是已经实现了的或者很快就要实现的。
    最近几天，各地纷纷传来小麦高额丰产的捷报，这是多么激动人心的捷报啊！为六亿人民的幸福而付出过无数心血和汗水的人们，谁能够不为这样伟大的胜利而欢欣若狂！看吧，安徽省六安县淠东一社的二千二百亩小麦经过预测，平均每亩产量可达八百斤。其中有二十八亩亩产可达一千多斤。河北省宁津县利民社六百七十六亩小麦，估计每亩可产七百斤。湖北省襄阳专区，亩产一千五百斤到二千斤的小麦各地都有。该省光化县幸福农业社有十一亩小麦，亩产实产达到三千二百一十五斤。这些产量数字，比一般产量已经高出不少倍，可是，这还不是今年的全国最高纪录！截至今天收到的消息，全国最高纪录出现在河南省遂平县卫星农业社。在那里，有二亩九分小麦每亩产量达到了三千五百三十斤七两半。这好像只是一个理想。但是不然，这是现实！这是已经拿到手的实物！
    在党的“八大”第二次会议上，刘少奇同志代表党中央所作的报告中说过：“我们有六亿多人口，我们党同这六亿多人口结成了血肉的联系，依靠这伟大的力量，凡是人类能够做的事，我们都能够做，或者很快就能够做，没有什么事我们不能够做的。”亩产三千多斤，这是前人很难想像的产量。但是现在我们做到了。
    党中央一再号召我们，要敢想，敢说，敢做，不要妄自菲薄，委靡不振。这许许多多的小麦高产纪录证明，只要我们想到了，干到了，就得到了丰硕的收获。那些还在“观潮”、还要等“秋后算账”的人们，现在该作何感想呢？让我们奉劝他们：不要再怀疑观望了，赶紧振作起来，跟着时代、跟着群众一起前进吧！
    今天的伟大成果，不是天公赐与，是我们勤劳勇敢的人民双手创造的。在我们的优越的社会制度下面，在我们以马克思列宁主义武装起来了的党中央的领导下面，我国人民的聪明才智，可以变成无穷无尽的力量。只要我们认真发动群众，全心全意依靠群众，我们国家就可以创造出前无古人的奇迹。小麦生产如此，其他任何事业也是如此。
    二千多年以前，我国的古圣先贤就有了“尽地利”即充分发挥地力的远大理想。现在，在我们的国家，充分发挥地力的时代已经到来。小麦只能低产不能高产的老观念，不是已经为活生生的事实打破了么？今年，或许我们只有十多亩地达到亩产三千几百斤的产量，到明年，我们就可能有成千上万个这样的十多亩。这决不是幻想！“社会生产力的发展要求社会主义革命，要求人们精神的解放；社会主义革命的胜利和人们精神的解放，又推动社会生产力的跃进；这种生产力的跃进，又继续刺激社会主义生产关系的改进和人们思想的前进。人们在不断地改造自然界的斗争中，不断地改造社会和改造人们自己。”（刘少奇同志在“八大”第二次会议上的报告）。今天的小麦高产纪录，使人们的思想从“小麦是低产作物”的迷信束缚下解放出来了。人们的思想跃进一步，必然会推动事物再跃进一步。五亿农民的思想跃进，将要发生多么巨大的威力！
    在我们的社会里，任何一个创造，任何一种奇迹，无论它出现在什么地方，很快都会变成全社会的财富。我们看到，从中央有关部门以至湖北省的有关领导同志和农业科学家们，都已经赶到光化县幸福农业社去进行实地观察研究，总结经验。我们要把这一经验向全国推广，掀起一个全国小麦生产赶先进的高潮。在还没有出现这样的高额产量的地区，不要以为只有在特殊肥沃的土地上才能创造奇迹。只要我们善于吸取先进的经验，在任何地方都可以创造奇迹。湖北襄阳专区的经验证明，各种各样的地区，包括山坡旱地，都能够争得高额丰产。枣阳县二十二个社的二百多亩千斤以上的小麦丰产纪录，大部分出现在历来产量只有一百多斤的瘠薄岗地上。竹溪县是有名的大山区，可是这个县的左溪乡民主社却有十二亩二分小麦平均亩产达到二千零一十九斤。“没有不良的土地，只有不良的耕作”，这句话永远是真理。在我们五亿多聪明勇敢的农民面前，什么样的瘠薄土地不能变成肥沃的良田呢？一切都是劳动创造的，肥田也是劳动创造的！我们相信，人民群众的劳动和智慧，将对我国的社会主义事业作出无穷无尽的贡献。
    让我向创造奇迹的农民兄弟祝贺，祝贺他们不断地得到更大的胜利！
