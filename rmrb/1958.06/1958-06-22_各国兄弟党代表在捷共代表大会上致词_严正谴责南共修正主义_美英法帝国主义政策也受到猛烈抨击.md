Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 20th - At the third day (June 20th) of the Czechoslovak Communist Party's 11th Congress, delegates continued to discuss the report of the Party Central Committee.

    In the morning session, the speeches of seven representatives focused on issues related to the national economy. Speakers explored how to more quickly and effectively achieve the general task of "completing socialist construction" put forward by the CPC Central Committee from different perspectives.

    After the speeches of these seven representatives, the heads and representatives of the delegations of the German Communist Party, the Austrian Communist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Finnish Communist Party, the Indian Communist Party, the Argentine Communist Party, the Spanish Communist Party, and the Mexican Communist Party addressed the congress with congratulations. Their speeches demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the international communist movement and the common will of working people around the world to oppose revisionism.

    The head of the Austrian Communist Party delegation, Koplenig, expressed his appreciation for the Czechoslovak Communist Party's resolute struggle against revisionism in his speech. Koplenig said that the Austrian Communist Party unanimously condemned the revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and fully agreed with Khrushchev's recent assessment at the Bulgarian Communist Party Congress.

    The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, condemned the American imperialists for organizing rebellions in Indonesia and supplying them with modern weapons and military instructors. He pointed out that no force in the world could force Indonesians to abandon the path of independence.

    The representative of the Spanish Communist Party emphasized that the Spanish Communist Party has always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and has carried out vigorous struggles against all manifestations of revisionism. He said that modern revisionism, represented by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, is a manifestation of imperialist ideology aimed at weakening the unity of the international communist movement and the strength of the socialist camp.

    The representative of the Indian Communist Party, Basu, said that the brilliant achievements of Czechoslovakia, alongside the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, embody the decisive victory of Marxist-Leninist thought. He emphasized that defending the purity of these ideas and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement is a historically significant task.

    The representatives of the Finnish, Mexican, and Argentine Communist Parties all strongly condemned the revisionist views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in their speeches.

    In the afternoon and evening sessions, a total of ten representatives spoke.

    Kopecky, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, talked about the tasks of Czechoslovak science in the cause of completing socialist construction. He emphasized the great importance of cooperation between Czechoslovak science and Soviet science, and reviewed the outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in scientific and technological progress, and also praised the achievements of Chinese science and technology.

    The speakers were followed by representatives from local party organizations, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives.

    Hendrich, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the evening session, and he firmly criticized modern revisionism. He said that the significance of the struggle against modern revisionism is no less than Lenin's struggle to crush Bernstein and the revisionism of the Second International. Lenin's victory in the struggle against revisionism was a prelude to the victory of the Great October Revolution and the victory of the entire struggle today. The victory in the struggle against modern revisionism will be another blow to imperialism, meaning that the international workers' movement will move forward more firmly.

    Hendrich pointed out in his speech that our congress shows that we agree with Comrade Khrushchev's criticism of Yugoslav revisionism at the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and we also fully agree with the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party's criticism of Yugoslav revisionism.

    At the afternoon and evening sessions, many representatives of communist and workers' parties addressed the congress with congratulations, warmly congratulating the achievements of the CPC and expressing infinite admiration for the CPC's consistent adherence to the principled stand of proletarian internationalism. They also emphasized the unity of the international workers' movement and condemned the revisionist views of the Yugoslav leadership group.

    The General Secretary of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties, Bagdash, said at the afternoon meeting that the efforts of the Yugoslav revisionists to spread revisionism in various Arab countries and undermine the friendship between Arab countries and the Soviet Union and socialist countries will surely end in bankruptcy.

    Bagdash said that the policy of imperialism has turned Lebanon into a base for plotting evil conspiracies against Syria and the entire Arab national liberation movement. He pointed out that if the American and British imperialists intend to occupy Lebanon, then the entire Arab East will become a volcano that will erupt at the feet of the imperialist invaders.

    The General Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, Bouhali, said that de Gaulle's attitude towards the Algerian issue means that the war against Algeria will continue, which is a provocation to all progressive mankind. As long as France refuses to negotiate with the National Liberation Front on the basis of national independence, the Algerian people will continue the war of liberation. He called on all fraternal parties to strengthen their solidarity with the Algerian people. The Algerian Communist Party will continue to resolutely oppose revisionism, considering it a major danger to the international communist movement.

    The head of the British Communist Party delegation, Klugman, said that the British Party opposes revisionism from whatever source, including Yugoslav revisionism. The British reactionaries used Yugoslav revisionism to create confusion for the working class.

    The representative of the Norwegian Communist Party, Ivar Lee, said in his speech that the Norwegian Communist Party firmly supports the Moscow Declaration.

    The representative of the Greek Communist Party, Grozos, said that our party unanimously rejects the revisionist theories of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    The representative of the Chilean Communist Party said that the Chilean Communist Party will oppose all forms of revisionism.

    Representatives of fraternal parties from Brazil, Sweden, Canada, Belgium, Colombia, Uruguay, Denmark, Tunisia, Morocco and other countries also gave congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

    各国兄弟党代表在捷共代表大会上致词
    严正谴责南共修正主义
    美英法帝国主义政策也受到猛烈抨击
    据新华社布拉格20日电  在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会第三天（20日）会议上，代表们继续讨论党中央委员会的报告。
    在上午的会议上，七位代表的发言都着重谈到有关国民经济的问题。发言人从不同角度探讨了怎样更快更好地实现捷共中央提出的“完成社会主义建设”的总任务。
    这七位代表发言以后，德国共产党、奥地利共产党、印度尼西亚共产党、芬兰共产党、印度共产党、阿根廷共产党、西班牙共产党和墨西哥共产党的代表团团长和代表向大会致祝词。他们的讲话显示了国际共产主义运动牢不可破的团结，也表现了全世界劳动人民反对修正主义的共同意志。
    奥地利共产党代表团团长柯普勒尼希在讲话中对捷克斯洛伐克共产党坚决地同修正主义作斗争表示赞扬。柯普勒尼希说，奥地利共产党一致谴责南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领，完全同意赫鲁晓夫最近在保共代表大会上所作的估计。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在讲话中谴责了美帝国主义者在印度尼西亚境内组织叛乱，并且供给他们现代武器和军事教官。他指出，世界上没有任何力量能够强迫印度尼西亚人放弃独立的道路。
    西班牙共产党代表强调指出，西班牙共产党一向忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，并且同修正主义的一切表现进行有力的斗争。他说，以南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟为代表的现代修正主义，是旨在削弱国际共产主义运动的团结和社会主义阵营的力量的帝国主义意识形态的表现。
    印度共产党代表巴苏说，捷克斯洛伐克同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国并肩取得的辉煌成就，体现了马克思列宁主义思想的决定性胜利。他强调指出，保卫这些思想的纯洁，加强社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，是具有历史意义的任务。
    芬兰、墨西哥和阿根廷共产党的代表在讲话时都严正地谴责了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义观点。
    在下午和晚上的会议上，发言的共有十位代表。
    捷共中央政治局委员柯别茨基谈到捷克斯洛伐克科学在完成社会主义建设的事业中的任务。他着重指出了捷克斯洛伐克科学同苏联科学合作的极大重要性，并且回顾了苏联在科学技术进步方面所取得的卓越成就，还赞扬了中国科学和技术的成就。
    接着发言的有各地党组织、企业和农业合作社的代表们。
    捷共中央书记亨德里赫在晚间会议上发了言，他坚决地批判了现代修正主义。他说，对现代修正主义的斗争的意义不逊于列宁粉碎伯恩斯坦和第二国际修正主义的斗争。列宁对修正主义斗争的胜利是伟大十月革命胜利和今天整个斗争胜利的前奏。对现代修正主义斗争的胜利将是对帝国主义的又一打击，意味着国际工人运动将更加坚定地前进。
    亨德里赫在发言中指出，我们的代表大会表明：我们同意赫鲁晓夫同志在保共第七次代表大会上对南共修正主义的批评，也完全同意中共八大第二次会议对南共修正主义的批判。
    在下午和晚间会议上，有许多共产党和工人党的代表向大会致祝词，对捷共的成就表示热烈祝贺，对捷共一贯坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则立场表示无限钦佩。他们也强调国际工人运动的团结，谴责南共领导集团的修正主义观点。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党总书记巴格达什在下午会议上说，南斯拉夫修正主义者要在各阿拉伯国家中散布修正主义和破坏阿拉伯国家同苏联和社会主义国家间的友谊的努力一定会以破产告终。
    巴格达什说帝国主义的政策已经把黎巴嫩变成一个策划反对叙利亚和整个阿拉伯民族解放运动的罪恶阴谋的基地。他指出，如果美英帝国主义者打算占领黎巴嫩，那么整个阿拉伯东方将变成在帝国主义侵略者脚下的一触即发的火山。
    阿尔及利亚共产党总书记布哈利说，戴高乐对待阿尔及利亚问题的态度意味着将要继续对阿尔及利亚进行战争，这是对全体进步人类的一种挑衅。只要法国拒绝在民族独立的基础上同民族解放阵线谈判，阿尔及利亚人民就要继续进行解放战争。他要求一切兄弟党加强对阿尔及利亚人民的声援。阿尔及利亚共产党将继续坚决反对修正主义，认为它是对国际共产主义运动的一个主要危险。
    英国共产党代表团团长克卢格曼说，英国的党反对不管来自任何方面的修正主义，包括南斯拉夫的修正主义在内，英国反动派利用了南斯拉夫的修正主义来为工人阶级制造混乱。
    挪威共产党代表伊瓦·李在讲话中说，挪威共产党坚决支持莫斯科宣言。
    希腊共产党代表格罗佐斯说，我们党一致驳斥南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义理论。
    智利共产党代表说，智利共产党将反对一切形式的修正主义。
    在会上致祝词的还有巴西、瑞典、加拿大、比利时、哥伦比亚、乌拉圭、丹麦、突尼斯、摩洛哥等国的兄弟党的代表。
