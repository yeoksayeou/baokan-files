    Blocking the Road to Personal Dictatorship
    Anti-Fascist Organizations in Various Parts of France Actively Carry Out Activities
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th - The Committees for the Defense of the Republic in various parts of France are actively carrying out activities to block the road to personal dictatorship.
    Currently, such committees have been established in more than thirty of the ninety provinces in France.
    Many committees are preparing to convene meetings with the participation of Republican members of various political parties to determine the current tasks and methods of activity. The Committee for the Defense of the Republic in the Lot-et-Garonne department convened a meeting of representatives from local committees throughout the province.
    In Belfort, the Committee for the Defense of the Republic called on the working people to heighten their vigilance and prepare to counter the provocations of the so-called "Committees of Public Safety," which are eager to try. In Finistère, six committees decided to further expand their activities. The committees of Brest and Saint-Pol-de-Léon called on all democrats to unite and take action to promote the establishment of a Republican government.
    At the same time, committees in many places are further establishing grassroots organizations to strengthen the forces defending the Republic. The Committees for the Defense of the Republic in many places, such as Pierrefitte, are establishing organizations in residential areas. In Grenoble, workers at the Roussillon factory formed a Committee for the Defense of the Republic.

    堵塞个人独裁的道路
    法各地反法西斯组织积极展开活动
    新华社巴黎10日电　法国各地的保卫共和国委员会正为堵塞个人独裁的道路积极展开活动。
    目前在法国的九十个省中已经有三十多个省设立了这样的委员会。
    许多委员会准备召开有各个不同政党的共和派议员参加的会议，以确定当前的任务和活动方式。罗特加隆省的保卫共和国委员会召开了全省各地方委员会代表会议。
    在培尔福，保卫共和国委员会号召劳动人民提高警惕，准备反击跃跃欲试的所谓“救国委员会”的挑衅。在菲尼斯台省，有六个委员会决定进一步展开活动。布勒斯特和圣波德累翁的委员会号召一切民主人士团结起来、采取行动以促进共和政府的成立。
    同时许多地方的委员会正在进一步建立基层组织以壮大保卫共和的力量，皮埃尔菲特等许多地方的保卫共和国委员会正在居民区里建立组织。在格累诺布尔，鲁斯图居工厂的工人们组成了保卫共和国委员会。
