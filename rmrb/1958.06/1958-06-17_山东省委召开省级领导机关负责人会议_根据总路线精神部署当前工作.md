Jinan Dispatch from our Newspaper: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of leading cadres of provincial-level organs on June 3rd to convey and study the resolutions and spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and to deploy current work.

At the meeting, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, repeatedly explained the great significance of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" proposed by Chairman Mao and adopted by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, as well as the tasks of technical revolution and cultural revolution currently put forward by the Party. He said that in order to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the instructions of the Central Committee, the overall task at present, in light of the actual situation in Shandong Province, is to comprehensively grasp "thought, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs." This means that first of all, we must strengthen ideological work, with rectification as the commander, industrial and agricultural production as the center, and technical and cultural revolutions as the two key points. The most important task on the agricultural production front is to complete spring planting and replanting seedlings, protect seedlings, do a good job in summer harvesting and summer planting, continue to fight drought in areas without rain, and at the same time prepare for flood control, especially to ensure that the wheat is harvested and ensure a bumper harvest throughout the year.

Shu Tong emphasized that rectification must be carried through to the end, deeply and thoroughly. Units that have not thoroughly carried out the anti-rightist and anti-right-leaning conservative thought struggles must focus on making up lessons during rectification. Currently, rectification and make-up lessons have begun in the leading organs of the province, cities, and regions. In the make-up lessons, many serious problems have been exposed. From the first meeting of the Provincial Party Congress in July 1956 (i.e., the Qingdao Meeting) to the Provincial Four-Level Cadre Meeting in November 1957, there has been a struggle between two roads and two lines within and outside the Party in Shandong. Some people reacted very quickly to "opposing rash advance" and sweeping away "typhoons," but they have no interest in the Party's socialist construction cause. They are not inserting red flags but white flags, not promoting but hindering. They adopt an attitude of listening or not listening to the decisions of the Party Committee. They do not regard the Party Committee as the highest organization of the proletariat, placing their work under the leadership of the Party Committee and faithfully implementing the decisions of the Party Committee; instead, they regard the Party Committee as a federation, acting on what they agree with and discarding what they disagree with, forming their own system, doing their own thing, confronting the Party Committee, and being disloyal. If these problems are not resolved, it will be impossible to unite and correctly implement the Party's guidelines and lines.

Finally, Shu Tong pointed out that units above the county level should thoroughly solve the problems of localism, decentralism, sectarianism, and departmentalism, and immediately conduct inspections from the perspective of implementing the Party's guidelines, lines, and resolutions. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee will both conduct rectification in this spirit, deeply and thoroughly, persevere to the end, and achieve complete victory. In this way, our entire Party in Shandong will be united, and with one heart and one mind, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, we will move from victory to new and greater victories.

    山东省委召开省级领导机关负责人会议
    根据总路线精神部署当前工作
    本报济南电　中共山东省委于6月3日，召开省级领导机关负责人会议，传达学习党的“八大”二次会议的决议和精神，部署当前工作。
    会上，省委第一书记舒同同志，一再说明毛主席倡议的“八大”二次会议通过的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线和党在目前提出的技术革命、文化革命任务的重大意义。他说，为了认真贯彻执行“八大”二次会议的精神和中央的指示，根据山东地区的实际情况，当前总的任务是把“思、工、农、商、学、兵”全面地抓起来。这就是说，首先要加强思想工作，整风是统帅，工农业生产是中心，技术革命、文化革命是两个关键。当前农业生产战线上最重要的一关，是突击完成春田播种和补苗、保苗，搞好夏收、夏种，无雨的地方继续抗旱，同时做好防汛准备，特别重要的是保证将麦子拿到手，保证全年大丰收。
    舒同强调提出，要把整风坚持到底，搞深搞透。反右派、反右倾保守思想还不彻底的单位，必须在整风中重点补课。目前省、市、地领导机关整风补课已经开始。在补课中，暴露了许多严重的问题。自1956年7月省党代表大会第一次会议（即青岛会议）至1957年11月省四级干部会议，山东党内党外一直存在着两条道路、两条路线的斗争。有一部分人对“反冒进”、刮“台风”反应很快，但对党的社会主义建设事业却毫无兴趣。他们不是插红旗而是插白旗，不是促进而是促退。他们对党委的决议采取可听可不听的态度，他们不是把党委看作是无产阶级的最高组织，把自己的工作置于党委领导之下，忠实执行党委的决议；而是把党委看作是联合会，合则行之，不合则抛在一边，自成系统，自搞一套，与党委分庭抗礼、离心离德。这些问题如果不解决，就不可能团结一致正确地贯彻党的方针和路线。
    最后，舒同指出县以上的单位，要彻底解决地方主义、分散主义、宗派主义、本位主义思想，从执行党的方针路线决议方面立即进行检查，省委常委与省人委都将本此精神进行整风，搞深搞透，坚持到底，取得全胜。这样，我们山东全党就能团结一致，万众一心，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，从胜利走向新的更大的胜利。
