Tonight we should arrive at the "Greening Cooperative" in the Yimeng Mountains, a model cooperative that has been nationally recognized for its afforestation efforts.

On the way, we heard that the director of the Greening Cooperative, Director Song, had been bitten by a dog and his leg was very swollen. How is he now? We got off the bus and arrived at the Greening Cooperative at dusk. Someone said that the director had gone up the mountain to check on the newly planted peanuts. Here, in front of the village, behind the village, east of the village, and west of the village, there are mountains connecting mountains and ridges connecting ridges; as soon as you step out the door, you're in the mountains.

The door of the cooperative office was closed, and the loudspeaker mounted above the window was broadcasting Peking Opera. The war drums thumped, and the singing was high-pitched. Such a lively opera, but not many people were listening, because everyone was out building the reservoir.

I originally planned to ask someone to go to the construction site with me, but I struck out everywhere I went. What to do? I only knew that the reservoir was being built to the west of the village, so I headed in that direction, hoping to find it.

Leaving the village, the small road extended into a mountain gully. I was carefully watching my step when a voice suddenly rang out in front of me: "Who is it?" In this quiet mountain stream night, the voice sounded particularly loud. Following the beam of my flashlight, I saw a winding path climbing up the cliff. Although I couldn't see a person, I still shouted loudly with hope: "Comrade, are you going to the construction site?" An answer immediately rang out clearly:
	"Yes, let's go together." He replied briskly and decisively.

The person I met was none other than the director of the cooperative. He was in his fifties, with a kind face and bright eyes. Dressed in a blue jacket and blue trousers, he immediately gave the impression of being a capable, straightforward, and very calculating head of the household.

We walked one in front of the other. He told me that when the reservoir was completed, it would be able to irrigate more than a thousand mu of land, accounting for one-third of the cooperative's total land. In the future, the water would not flow from the bottom of the ditch, but would run over the top of the ridge.... The director became more and more excited and happy as he spoke. Even though we had crossed another big gully and climbed another steep slope, I no longer felt it was difficult to walk. At this time, a fan-shaped patch of red light shone on the opposite mountain. That was probably the construction site. The director glanced back at me and said with pride, "Treasure mountains and treasure water, even if you offered to exchange this mountain area for the plains, we wouldn't want to."

The reservoir was nearing completion. Here, surrounded by mountain cliffs and high ridges, the newly built stone wall bravely cut off the deep gully where water had been flowing for perhaps thousands of years. People were busy ramming earth and transporting soil, shuttling back and forth; red lanterns hung on the old mulberry trees, and lights shone halfway up the mountain. On the nearby blue stone walls, two lines of words could be seen in powder:

	Lanterns and torches red in the sky
	Deep mountain streams compete with heroes
A large amount of water had already accumulated in the reservoir, and only the tops of a few white poplars, covered with green leaves, were visible. The water was so clear that the stream of people walking along the water's edge, accompanied by the lights, clearly projected their shadows onto the water's surface. In the nearby night, the creaking of carts could be heard, high-pitched and drawn-out, as if coming from mid-air, further adding to the joyful atmosphere of this mountain stream construction site.

The director stopped a young man who was carrying soil and said, "Team leader, why haven't you put up ropes by the water's edge yet?" The team leader wiped the sweat from his face and said a little embarrassed, "Haven't had time." The director did not say a word of criticism, but only shifted his gaze from the young man's face and pointed to the silhouettes of people moving like flying shadows on the water: "Look!" The team leader also quickly glanced at the water's surface, and the smile on his face immediately disappeared.

He promised, "I'll go get it done right away!" But he didn't leave. He looked at the director, suddenly furrowed his brow, and complained, "Your leg is still swollen, the others told you not to come, why did you come again?"

The director quickly defended himself, "It's alright, I can still work." Perhaps he was still afraid that the young man wouldn't be at ease, he turned to me and said, "If you don't believe me, ask this comrade, I'm walking just as fast as him." Then he added, "There are so many people, and there's no moon, so tell them to be extra careful with their hoes and shovels."

When I carried back a load of soil, the director was already ramming earth with the young people. He was enthusiastically shouting the rhythm in his thick voice.

    山涧夜晚
    董均伦
    今天就能到达沂蒙山区里的“绿化社”了，这是一个在造林方面曾经得到国家奖励的模范社。
    在路上，便听说绿化社宋主任的腿叫狗咬了，肿得很是厉害。现在怎样了呢？下了汽车，走到绿化社，已经是黄昏了。有人说，社主任上山检查刚种上的花生去了。这里，庄前庄后，庄东庄西，山连山，岭连岭的，出门便是山。
    社办公室的门关着，安在窗上面的广播筒，正在播送京剧。战鼓咚咚，唱腔高昂。这样热闹的戏，却没有多少人听，因为人们都修水库去了。
    本来打算约个人一块儿上工地去，找了几个地方，都扑空了。怎么办呢？只知道在庄的西面修水库，朝着方向走吧，也许能找到的。
    出了庄，小路便伸到了一条山沟里去，我正留神脚下，前面突然响起了一个问声：“谁呀？”在这安静的山涧夜晚里，这声音显得格外响亮。顺着手电光看去，只见一条弯曲的小路爬上了崖头，虽然看不见个人影，我还是满怀希望地大声问道：“同志，你是到工地上去吗？”应声立刻又清楚地响了过来：
  “是呀，咱们一块儿走吧。”他回答得利落干脆。
    我所遇见的，不是别人，正是社主任。他有五十多岁，脸面忠厚，两眼很有精神，青袄青裤，一看便使人觉得，这是一个能干、爽直，很有算计的当家人。
    我们一前一后地走着，他告诉我，这个水库修起来，能浇一千多亩地，占全社土地的三分之一。将来的水不是从沟底流，而是叫它从岭顶上走……。社主任越说越兴奋，越说越欢喜。尽管又翻过了一条大沟，又爬上了一个陡坡，我再也不觉得难走了。这时对面的山头上，扇面样的亮着一片红光。那里大约是工地了。社主任回头扫了我一眼，口气自豪地说道：“宝山、宝水，拿平原来换这山区，俺还不愿意换呢。”
    水库已经接近完工了。这里周围都是山崖高岭，那条新修的石墙，威武的斩断千年也许万年都在流水的深沟。人们在忙着打夯运土，穿梭样的来来往往；老桑树上挂着红灯，半山腰里也亮着火光。近处青色的石壁上，可以望到两行粉字：
    灯笼火把空中红
    深山陡涧比英雄
    水库里已经积下了一大片水，几棵白杨，只露出了半截长满绿叶的树梢。水是那样清亮，走在水边的人流，伴着灯光，把自己的影子清楚地投到水面上。相离不远的夜色里，响着吱吱哟哟的小车声，高昂、悠长像是从半空里传来的，更给这山涧工地，增添着欢乐的意味。
    社主任截住了一个正在挑土的小伙子说：“大队长，怎么还没把水边上拦上绳子。”大队长抹着脸上的汗，有点发窘地说：“不得空啊。”社主任没有说一句责备的话，只把眼睛从小伙子的脸上移开，指着水面上如飞的人影说：“你看！”大队长也风快地向水面上扫了一眼，脸上的笑容立时隐退了。
    他答应道：“我这就去弄！”可是并没有走开，他望着社主任，忽然蹙起了眉毛，埋怨说：“你的腿还肿，大伙不叫你来，怎么又来了？”
    社主任连忙分辩说：“不要紧，我一样能干。”大约他还害怕小伙子不放心，转脸对着我说：“不信，你问问这个同志，我走的和他一样快呀。”接着又叮咛道：“人这样多，没有月亮，镐头、铁锨的，叫他们多加小心呵。”
    当我挑回一担土来，社主任已经和青年人在一起打夯了。他用粗壮的嗓门，兴高彩烈地喊着号子。
