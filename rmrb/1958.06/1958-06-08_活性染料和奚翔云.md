　　Reactive Dyes and Xi Xiangyun

　　Clothes lose their color and become less beautiful as they age, which shows that all dyes in the past would fade. If you want the dye to not fade after the fiber is dyed, you need to combine the dye with the fiber. In 1956, Britain, Switzerland and West Germany successively produced an organic dye containing reactive halogen atoms. This dye is called "reactive dye". The halogen atoms in this dye can interact with the hydrogen atoms in the relevant groups on the fiber in an alkaline environment to generate hydrogen halide. This makes the dye molecules other than halogen atoms firmly chemically bonded to the fiber. Therefore, the dye is not easy to fall off, and basically achieves the effect that the clothes will not fade even if they are worn out and broken; moreover, this dye has a wide range of applications, the dyeing process is very simple, and the cost is low, so it is the best new type of dye in the world today. Because this is a new dye, countries such as Britain never reveal technical information in this area. However, Xi Xiangyun, a young technician from the Shanghai Runhua Dye Factory, with the cooperation and support of workers Jiang Boqi and Qian Wu Ba, developed twelve reactive dyes after four months of research. Currently, my country has reached the world's peak in dye manufacturing.
　　The young technician Xi Xiangyun is twenty-six years old this year. He graduated from Shanghai Hujiang University. He started working in September 1952. He was assigned to Shanghai Chemical Factory as a technician. In 1956, he was named an advanced worker in Shanghai for improving a certain plastic formula, saving raw materials, teaching workers technology, and helping workers summarize operating experience. In 1957, he was transferred to Runhua Dye Factory as a technician in the laboratory.
　　Xi Xiangyun's characteristic is that he is sensitive to all new things, likes to fantasize, likes to ask questions, likes to study hard, and likes to do experiments. Before he successfully trial-produced the first reactive dye in China this year, he studied the structure of a dye (copper red-brown) produced in five countries including Switzerland, found out the shortcomings of this dye in structure, and proposed a plan to improve the structure, making the dye produced in my country better than that of other countries.
　　Before the successful trial production of reactive dyes, some engineers and professors in Shanghai, Liaoning, Jilin and other places had noticed the emergence of this British dye, but some people were frightened by the British advertisements promoting the particularly excellent performance and fastness of reactive dyes, thinking that reactive dyes were very complicated to manufacture and afraid that they would be ridiculed if the research failed. Some people spent several months dissecting British reactive dyes, but the British put a lot of useless fillers in these dyes to confuse us, so that the dissection did not yield any results. Before starting his research, Xi Xiangyun looked everywhere for British materials and asked people for advice. Based on some inspirations from foreign advertisements, he finally produced this dye, which the British boasted as a trump card, on January 6 this year.

### 活性染料和奚翔云

　　活性染料和奚翔云
    衣服穿旧了颜色就不及新的漂亮，这说明过去无论那一种染料都会褪色。如果要纤维染上染料不褪色，就需要使染料和纤维化合。1956年，英国、瑞士和西德先后制成一种含有活性的卤素原子的有机染料，这种染料叫“活性染料”。这种染料中的卤素原子，在碱性环境中能与纤维上的有关基团中的氢原子发生作用，生成卤化氢，这就使卤素原子以外的染料分子与纤维之间也发生了牢固的化学结合，因此染料就不易脱掉，基本上做到衣服穿旧着破也不褪色；而且这种染料应用范围广泛、染色过程非常简便，成本低廉，所以这是目前世界上最好的一种新型染料。因为这是一种新的染料，英国等国对这方面的技术资料从不透露。但是我国上海润华染料厂青年技术员奚翔云在工人蒋伯祺和钱伍捌的合作、支持下，经过四个月的研究，制成了十二种活性染料。目前我国在染料制造方面已登上世界高峰。
    青年技术员奚翔云，今年二十六岁。上海沪江大学毕业。1952年9月参加工作。分配在上海化工厂当技术员。1956年，因改进某种塑料配方，节约原材料和教工人学技术，帮助工人总结操作经验，被评选为上海市先进工作者。1957年调到润华染料厂当化验室的技术员。
    奚翔云的特点是对一切新鲜事物都很敏感，好幻想、好问、好钻研、好动手作试验。在今年试制成功国内第一种活性染料之前，他研究了瑞士等五个国家生产的一种染料（铜染红棕）的结构，找出了这种染料结构上的缺点，提出了改进结构的方案，使我国生产出的这种染料，比其他国家的都好。
    活性染料试制成功前，上海、辽宁、吉林等地某些工程师和教授，都注意到英国这种染料的出现，但有些人被英国广告上宣传活性染料的性能特别优良、牢度特别好吓住了，以为活性染料制造起来十分复杂，怕研究不成功被人耻笑。有些人曾花了好几个月的时间，把英国的活性染料进行解剖，但英国人在这种染料里放了许多无用的填充材料迷惑我们，使解剖得不到什么结果。奚翔云在动手研究前，曾到处寻找英国资料，向人请教。他根据国外广告上的一些启发，终于在今年1月6日把这种英国人吹为王牌的染料制成了。
