    After a bumper wheat harvest, the Wuxing First Agricultural Cooperative in Huxian County, Shaanxi Province, in order to win the second bumper harvest of this year by taking advantage of the victory, all the members launched a new upsurge of deep plowing. They thresh grain during the day and plow the land at night, full of energy. This is a scene of the members and the staff of the Huxian County Health Institute who came to support them plowing the land together. They plowed more than 200 mu of land in three nights.

Fucheng Township now averages 863 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu, more than double the amount of fertilizer accumulated last winter and spring. The picture shows members of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in the township scraping grass turf and mud in front of and behind the village to compost fertilizer.
