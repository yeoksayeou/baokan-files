The Most Intelligent People
    ——Materials on the Thirty-Six Newly Admitted Members of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery

    Editor's Note: Scientific and technological inventions mostly originate from the working people. The material published in this newspaper today once again fully proves this point. These people are the most intelligent. Their creations and inventions will encourage many petty intellectuals, many workers and peasants, and many new and old cadres to cast aside their inferiority complexes, cut off their self-deprecation, break down superstitions, and inspire the fearless spirit of creation to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do.

    Yue Yongchao Creates the Great Leap Forward Rapid Waterwheel

    Yue Yongchao is 54 years old and is a carpenter in the Fourteenth Cooperative of Heshangqiao Township, Changge County, Henan Province. He comes from a middle peasant background and attended school for five years.

    During the Great Leap Forward, to realize water conservancy, he created the Great Leap Forward Rapid Waterwheel. This waterwheel has a larger water output than three Liberation-type waterwheels. When operated by two people, it can irrigate twelve to fourteen mu of land per day.

    This creation was completed jointly by him and a cooperative member surnamed Zheng. Some people in the masses initially did not believe in them, and they themselves were afraid of losing face if they failed. As a result, they only conducted experiments after work. However, due to their hard work, they finally succeeded.

    Gong Peizhi Creates the Double-Rail Shuttle Cart

    Gong Peizhi, a carpenter from the Haogouji Iron and Wood Production Cooperative in Su County, Anhui Province, has been a carpenter since he was fifteen years old, for a total of twenty-two years. During water conservancy efforts, he accepted the task of manufacturing a shuttle cart. He first automated the unloading of soil, but the soil box could only open automatically and not close automatically. He put a lot of thought into solving this problem. At that time, he was attending a provincial exhibition of advanced tools for water management. One night, when he came back and pushed the door, the door closed automatically, which attracted him and led him to install a spring made of bamboo strips on the soil box. He also added ball bearings to the axle, making it very easy to crank. Later, it was changed to a double rail, with an automatic soil-loading basket, which increased efficiency many times over.

    This double-rail shuttle cart, operated by six people for ten hours a day, can transport an average of twelve to fifteen cubic meters of soil per person. It is suitable for digging ditches, digging ponds, building embankments, and repairing reservoirs; it has been widely promoted in Anhui.

    Zhang Guangyi, Creator of the Automatic Crowbar Rammer

    Zhang Guangyi is the Party Branch Secretary of the Leisong Agricultural Cooperative in Leifeng Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province. He is 38 years old, from a poor peasant background, and only attended school for one year in the old society.

    After the movement to build water conservancy projects began in 1956, the entire cooperative sent 400 people to repair reservoirs, while farm work was also very busy. Therefore, he began to study new tools to improve labor efficiency. One night, he suddenly thought of the principle of the scale. He thought that although the weight of the scale was small, it could press hundreds of pounds. Why couldn't the ramming tool be improved by using this principle? The next day, just as he was about to borrow a scale for research, a carpenter had already developed a lever-type rammer. This tool could save 50% of the labor, but it could not move forward automatically. Therefore, after more than a year and fourteen improvements, Zhang Guangyi transformed the stone ram that twelve people took turns lifting into an automatic crowbar ram that could be operated by two women. This crowbar ram has three major characteristics: 1. It hits in the front and rolls in the back, landing stably. 2. It hits and moves automatically. 3. It has a simple structure.

    The Dengfeng County Party Committee promoted more than 400 of these crowbar rammers throughout the county at one time.

    In addition, he also made two types of ridging machines, which, with two people and one animal, can ridge eighty mu per day, increasing efficiency twenty-seven times compared to the past. From 1956 to the present, he has successfully created twelve types of tools, including water lifting, ridging, sowing tools, and sluice gates.

    Wang Shujin Creates a Hand-Cranked Mill

    Wang Shujin, Deputy Head of the sideline business of Xinying First Cooperative, Yingyang Town, Kaifeng County, Henan Province, is 37 years old, from a lower-middle peasant background, and has not attended school.

    During the large-scale water conservancy efforts in the winter of 1957, their cooperative had to build eight reservoirs, and all the labor force had to go to the reservoir construction site. However, at that time, more than eighty laborers were left to grind flour. This gave him the idea of improving the flour-grinding tool. He spent three months making a hand-cranked mill. He used the frame of the Liberation-type waterwheel and placed the stone mill on top. One person can turn the handle or step on it with their feet to produce flour, and it can automatically sift it out, increasing efficiency twenty times compared to manual pushing and ten times compared to animal power. Now, only four people are needed in the entire cooperative to grind flour, saving seventy to eighty laborers to be put into other production.

    The hand-cranked mill he created has been promoted throughout the province.

    Wang Yuzhen, Creator of Underground Canals

    At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, many people were attracted by the underground canals. Who is the creator of the underground canals? It is Wang Yuzhen, the Party Branch Secretary of the Dongduo Agricultural Cooperative in Huaimiao Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province. Wang Yuzhen comes from a poor peasant background and had not attended school before liberation. Now he only has a primary school education.

    When building water conservancy projects in 1957, the cooperative bought four locomotive boilers, which could irrigate a lot of land, but the canals occupied fifteen mu of good land with three harvests a year. The branch secretary was very distressed, so he discussed with the cadres to build underground canals, but some of the masses said it couldn't be done. A meeting of tile kiln workers was held to study the burning of tile pipes, and the workers also said it couldn't be done. However, after the underground tile pipe canal was completed, everyone said it could be done. Everyone summarized that underground canals have three savings, three conveniences, and one prevention. The three savings are saving land, saving water, and saving labor; the three conveniences are convenience of transportation, convenience of cultivation, and convenience of planting; and one prevention is preventing flooding, so that both low-lying and high-lying land can be irrigated.

    This creation is indeed original, daring to think and daring to do. Its promotion will have a great impact on agricultural production.

    Chen Fatian, Creator of the Leap Forward Cone

    Chen Fatian, the well-drilling team leader of the Anshang Agricultural Cooperative in Neihuang County, Henan Province, comes from a poor peasant background, has studied carpentry, and is not very literate.

    In December 1957, the Neihuang County Party Committee proposed the task of one hundred days of water conservancy. There were still twenty-eight wells in their cooperative that had not been dug. At that time, the entire cooperative only had one set of well-sinking tools, and it took forty days to dig one well, so it would take more than three years to dig twenty-eight wells.

    Chen Fatian believed that the key was to improve the well-sinking tools. He considered how to change the single pipe to a double pipe, one pipe for drilling the well and one pipe for sucking mud. He made a model and asked three blacksmiths to make it. It was not successful at first, and some people said, "If he succeeds, the sun will rise from the west!" Of course, the sun will never rise from the west, but with the support of the Party Branch and the help of an old well-drilling technician, this illiterate finally made a double-pipe cone. It could dig a well two meters deep and eighty centimeters in diameter in two days, increasing efficiency by more than seventy-nine times. This well-sinking tool was named the "Leap Forward Cone" by the masses. Later, the cooperative added two more sets of tools, and the twenty-eight wells were completed in one month. In addition, he also created twenty-four kinds of tools, such as hand-cranked waterwheels, ridging machines, hand-cranked saws, and hand-cranked drills.

    He Ting's Hand-Cranked Automatic Soil-Dumping Machine

    He Ting, who has never been to school for a single day, a 46-year-old from a hired peasant background, has created a hand-cranked automatic soil-dumping machine, which is known as "flying in the sky."

    He Ting is a member of the Hongxing Second Cooperative in Sunzhuang Township, Tanghe County, Henan Province. In 1957, the cooperative built four reservoirs in a big way. The deeper they dug, the more difficult it was to transport the soil. He and a few others discussed and created a hand-cranked automatic soil-dumping machine. Nine people operate it, and they can transport more than 240 cubic meters of soil per day, increasing efficiency eight times compared to carrying it by people.

    Due to his creation and the creations of other comrades in the cooperative, the four reservoirs were completed in three months. The Hongxing Second Cooperative has since been free from drought and flood.

    He also created five kinds of tools, including a human-pulled automatic manure-spreading cart, a ridging machine, and a foot-operated water pump.

    Gong Yunchang Creates an Arch-Shaped Soil-Transporting Device

    In the movement to build water conservancy projects on a large scale, soil-transporting tools were constantly being created. Gong Yunchang, a member of the Shuguang Cooperative in Fancheng Hui Nationality Town, Lin颍 County, Henan Province, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a second-year junior high school student, created an "arch-shaped soil-transporting device."

    This year, their town issued a call for one hundred days of water conservancy, requiring the digging of two hundred pits and ponds, but more than 160 people had not dug one well in half a month. He wanted to create an advanced soil-excavation tool. He encountered difficulties, and it was not suitable at the beginning, but after several revisions, it was finally successful. During this process, he received help from a comrade in the County Water Conservancy Office. This soil-transporting device is five times more efficient than carrying it by people.

    During the winter irrigation in 1957, he also created a single-pipe water pump and a platen waterwheel. During this year's spring plowing, he created a leveling hoe. His platen waterwheel can be applied to different sizes of well openings.

    Ma Lianchen Creates Soil-Transporting Tools

    Among the "native experts" who were hired as special researchers by the Institute of Agricultural Mechanization of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences this time, there is a 23-year-old youth named Ma Lianchen, who is a transferred cadre. He is from Nanyang City, Henan Province, apprenticed, and only attended school for four years. In 1951, he participated in the work of the Henan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. The place where he was transferred was the Guangming First Cooperative in Changying Township, Taikang County, Henan Province.

    After arriving at the cooperative, large-scale water conservancy was underway. He also participated in lifting soil and carrying soil. At first, he was so tired that his back hurt and his legs ached, and the cooperative members were also very tired, and some women's shoulders were worn out. Therefore, he was determined to change this situation. He spent eight days and nights working with the masses to create two types of soil-transporting tools: a mud sling and a hand-cranked soil-turning belt, increasing efficiency by two to sixteen times.

    Zhang Fulai, a Creative and Inventive Expert

    Zhang Fulai, a fitter at the Hefei Agricultural Tool Factory in Anhui Province, from a poor peasant background, did not graduate from elementary school, but this skilled craftsman among the working people created a clever machine called the grain purification computer. He began this research in 1953, and made five models one after another, and then made a large model. After being identified by the Provincial Grain Institute, it was considered basically successful, and it was fully completed in March 1958. This machine is a combined machine, which can automatically transport, pass through boxes, pass through wind, weigh, and calculate, and can complete 500,000 jin of grain per day, saving 400 laborers. This is a very outstanding creation and invention.

    He also invented a three-wheeled foot-operated waterwheel and a wooden Liberation-type waterwheel.

    Wang Shenggui Creates a Wind-Powered Waterwheel

    Wang Shenggui, a member of the Haibeitou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Daren County, Shanxi Province, from a poor peasant background, is 41 years old and has only read four years of books. He is a person who is not convinced by his low education and is full of enthusiasm and drive. He often said: "Even us native farmers must study technology." After liberation, the number of wells in their village increased from twenty to more than two hundred, and many human and animal power were needed for irrigation. He studied the use of wind power to drive the waterwheel. He had been considering it as early as 1948, and formally trial-produced it successfully in 1955. Some local people opposed it, but he did not bow his head.

    This waterwheel, in the case of a three-level wind, can irrigate six points of land per hour in a well two zhang deep. The greater the wind, the higher the efficiency. Now the local people are convinced. The masses said: "There are also livestock that can irrigate without eating grass or feed." His invention was rewarded by the People's Government of Shanxi Province.

    Mao Qichang Creates an Animal-Powered Liquid Manure Spreader

    Mao Qichang, the Deputy Director of the Cibei Agricultural Cooperative in Yeying Township, Taihe County, Anhui Province, is a 27-year-old young man, from a poor peasant background, and has a junior primary school education. In March 1956, he created an animal-powered liquid manure spreader. This car is shaped like a flatbed car, with a urine tank on it, and equipment for controlling the amount of water and distributing water behind the tank. It can not only apply top dressing but also irrigate the land, and it can also transport.

    At that time, farm work was very busy, and his family opposed it, saying that he was messing around. He had to work overtime at night. After it was made, it was used to apply top dressing to wheat fields, and more than ten acres were top-dressed in less than half a day. Not only was the efficiency high, but the application was also very even. This aroused everyone's attention.

    The second agricultural tool he created was the Hetian machine. This is used for ridging and preventing leakage after dry land is converted to paddy fields. With this Hetian machine, a large amount of human and animal power can be saved, so that the cooperative's work of converting dry land to paddy fields can be carried out smoothly.

    Bian Weixiang Creates an Aerial Soil Transporter

    The soil transporter created by Bian Weixiang is not only for aerial transportation, but also the soil box automatically opens and closes, and it can be cranked by hand or pedaled by foot. In addition, two seats were added next to the windlass so that the people who shake it can sit down to work.

    Bian Weixiang is a carpenter from the Anfeng Second Cooperative, Shuangmen Township, Shou County, Anhui Province. He is 38 years old this year, and he has been a carpenter since he was eighteen years old.

    The single-person hand-cranked foot-pedaled aerial soil transporter was created during the large-scale water conservancy construction in 1957. At that time, the cooperative members transported pond mud from morning to night, but each person could only transport more than one cubic meter per day. Bian Weixiang wondered if he could use iron wire as a track to transport soil from the air. Soon, his soil transporter was completed. One person can crank it by hand, and the work efficiency is five to six times higher than manual labor. He continued to improve it, adding pedals and seats.

    Xu Zhenwu, Creator of the Foot-Operated Mill

    Xu Zhenwu, 46 years old, from a poor peasant background, is the head of the agricultural tool reform headquarters in Liujiaping Township, Wufeng County, Hubei Province, and has read five years of books.

    He has been a carpenter since he was seventeen years old, and he is very clever and has created many inventions.

    What he brought to the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition this time is the model of the foot-operated mill created in January this year.

    Wufeng County is a mountainous area. For many years, grinding flour has been done by rolling two round stones. A whole laborer can only grind thirty to forty kilograms a day, and three to five families have one mill.

    After the great leap forward in production, everyone is busy with production and quickly repairing water conservancy projects, and some people have to be drawn to push the mill. In his own family, his wife had to push the mill all day long to provide food.

    Xu Zhenwu was determined to change this situation. He created a foot-operated mill, which can process 270 to 300 kilograms of grain a day, increasing efficiency several times. It only needs to be stepped on for two days, which is enough for the entire cooperative to eat for several days, which is very popular among the masses and has been promoted in the vicinity.

    Another creation of Xu Zhenwu is the antenna track that is several miles long. In the past, the people there had to walk a long way to collect firewood and carry it back. With this track, after collecting firewood, it slides down to the village in one go. This track can also transport soil.

    He also created waterwheels, threshers, cultivators, etc.

    Gong Guangyan Creates a Hand-Cranked Diamond Drill

    At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, the two types of hand-cranked diamond drills created by Gong Guangyan, a blacksmith at the Agricultural Tool Cooperative Factory in Changyang County, Hubei Province, attracted widespread attention. Some provinces ordered them, and many people drew diagrams, preparing to go back and imitate them.

    Gong Guangyan is 32 years old this year, from a poor peasant background, and has only read a few years of books. But his inventions and creations are outstanding.

    Their county is carrying out water conservancy, building a hundred-mile-long canal, which has to pass through a mountain, which is very difficult. If the mountain tunnel cannot be opened, the canal will not be successfully built. In this situation, Gu Guangyan created a machine gun-type hand-cranked diamond drill, and the drill bit used was the kind used for drilling iron. But it didn't work, that drill bit could drill iron, but not stone. The masses said that they had never seen a diamond drill in their lives. But he was not discouraged. The district party secretary encouraged him to do it, and they worked together for six days and six nights, creating a drill bit that looked like a steel pen tip, and adding three gears to the machine. So it was successful, and it could dig one zhang and two chi per day, increasing efficiency six times. But Gu Guangyan was still not reconciled. He then used the principle of the sewing machine to make a sewing-style hand-cranked diamond drill, increasing efficiency to eighteen chi per day.

    Many people from within and outside the province went to Changyang to visit and order goods. At the Agricultural Tool Exhibition, several more provinces ordered goods. Because this tool can be used for mining and opening mountain tunnels, it has great uses.

    Gong Guangyan also created weeding tools, waterwheels, etc.

    Wang Yushun Creates a Double-Layer Deep-Plowing Plow

    Deep plowing is an important measure to increase production. But in many places in China, farmers have to dig with iron shovels in the absence of deep-plowing tools. Now, Wang Yushun, the leader of the iron industry group of the Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative in Zengfumiao Township, Changge County, Henan Province, a 50-year-old man from a poor peasant background who has only attended private school for three years, has created a deep-plowing agricultural tool - a double-layer deep-plowing plow.

    This was created jointly by him and the cooperative leader Wang Shuiwang. In November 1957, the county party committee proposed to promote deep plowing. At that time, manual plowing was used, and one laborer could only plow one point per day. Wang Yushun accepted the task of manufacturing a deep-plowing plow. He worked hard for three days and failed three times, but finally succeeded. This plow can plow to one chi two to one chi five, and one person and three animals can plow three and a half mu per day. This increases efficiency by thirty-four times. This plow is most popular among the masses and has been promoted throughout the county.

    He has also successively created, modified, and imitated seventeen kinds of advanced tools, such as sweet potato slicers, harrowing weeding machines, double-ridge hoes, and double-ridge ten-tooth harrows.

    Wang Keshu Creates a Corn Planter

    Wang Keshu, a worker at the Wood Products Production Cooperative in Luxi County, Yunnan Province, is 51 years old this year and is very enthusiastic. In recent years, he has trial-produced wheat sowing boards and rice weeding tools. In October 1957, he and Shang Rugui created a double-row corn planter and a single-row corn planter. The double-row corn planter can plant sixteen mu per day, increasing efficiency three times compared to old-fashioned tools.

    He also created a grid machine, which can spin three strands of single yarn into sewing thread.

    Cement Expert Ma Faxi

    Native method expert Ma Faxi, from Zhuge Village, Zhuge Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, is an agricultural cooperative leader, from a poor peasant background, and has only read three years of books.

    From 1938, he and Ma Yongrui from the same village studied the use of local raw materials (chalky soil, red clay, and anthracite) to burn cement using native methods. But no one supported them in the old society. It was not until 1949 that they built a large furnace and burned the first batch of cement. The upsurge of water conservancy came, and rural areas needed to build many reservoirs and needed a lot of cement. Therefore, in March of this year, a total of seven furnaces were established in the township, producing 30 tons of cement per day, not only supplying the township but also supplying nearby agricultural cooperatives. Their cement is of high quality, the best can reach the level of 400 cement, and a set of scientific operating procedures has been established.

    This native method of burning cement is simple and easy to implement, and solves a big problem. (To be continued)

    最聪明的人
    ——中国农业机械学会新吸收的三十六个会员的材料
    编者按　科学、技术发明大都出于劳动人民。本报今天发表的这个材料，又一次充分地证明了这一点。这些人是最聪明的人。他们的创造和发明将鼓舞很多小知识分子、很多工人和农民、很多新老干部打掉自卑感，砍去妄自菲薄，破除迷信，振奋敢想、敢说、敢做的大无畏创造精神。
    岳永朝创跃进快速水车
    岳永朝今年五十四岁，是河南省长葛县和尚桥乡十四社的木工。他中农出身，上过五年学。
    在大跃进中，为了实现水利化，他创造了跃进快速水车。这种水车比三部解放式水车出水量大。两个人摇，每天可以浇地十二到十四亩。
    这项创造是他和一个姓郑的社员共同完成的。群众中有人起初不大相信他们，他们自己也有怕失败了丢人的想法。这样，他们只在收工后才进行试验；由于他们刻苦钻研，终于还是成功了。
    龚培芝创造双轨穿档滑车
    安徽省宿县蒿沟集铁木生产社的木工龚培芝，从十五岁起就作了木工，一直到现在，作了二十二年。他在水利化当中接受了一项制造穿档滑车的任务，他首先把卸土改成自动化，但是土箱只能自动开，不能自动关。为解决这个问题，费了很大心思。那时他正在省里开治水先进工具展览会，一天晚上回来，一推门，门自动关上了，这吸引了他，使他在土箱上装了用竹片作的弹簧；他还在轴上加了滚珠，摇起来非常轻快，以后又改成双轨，加上了自动装土的箥箕，效率提高了许多倍。
    这种双轨穿档滑车，六人操作，每天工作十时，每人可以平均运土十二到十五立方。它适用于挖沟、挖塘、筑圩、修水库；已在安徽大量推广。
    自动橇夯创造者张广义
    张广义是河南省登封县雷封乡雷嵩农业社的党支部书记。他今年三十八岁，贫农出身，在旧社会只上过一年学。
    在1956年兴修水利的运动开始以后，全社抽四百个人去修水库，而这时农活又很忙。于是，他就开始钻研新式工具，以提高劳动效率。一天晚上，他忽然想起秤的原理，他想秤铊虽小，能压几百斤，为什么打夯工具不能利用这原理改进呢？第二天，他正要借秤来研究，有一个木匠已研究出拉杆式压夯来了，这工具可节省劳力50％，但不能自动前进。于是，张广义通过一年多的十四次改进，把十二个人轮流抬的石夯，改进为两个妇女就能操作的自动撬夯。这撬夯有三大特点：一、前打后碾，落地平稳，二、自打自走，三、构造简单。
    中共登封县委一次就在全县推广这撬夯四百多部。
    此外，他还作成了两种打畦机，二人一畜，每天可打畦八十亩，比过去提高效率二十七倍。从1956年到现在，他已经创造成功提水、打畦、播种工具和水闸等十二种。
    王书金创造了手摇磨
    王书金，河南省开封县颖阳镇新颖一社的副业股长，今年三十七岁，出身下中农，没上过学。
    1957年冬季大搞水利，他们社要修建八座水库，劳动力都要去水库工地。可是当时还留下八十多个劳动力磨面粉。这使他有了改进磨面工具的想头。他花了三个月的时间，制成了手摇磨。他利用了解放式水车的架子，把石磨放在上边，一个人用手摇，或脚踏，就能出面，并且能自动筛出，比人工推提高效率二十倍，比畜力拉提高十倍。现在，全社只需四个人来磨面就够了，节省下七十到八十个劳动力，投入其他生产。
    他所创造的这种手摇磨已经在全省推广。
    地下渠道创造者王玉振
    在全国农具展览会上，许多人都被那地下渠道吸引住了。地下渠道的创造者是谁？是河南省偃师县槐庙乡东夺农业社的中共支部书记王玉振。王玉振出身贫农，解放前没上过学，现在也才有小学程度。
    1957年修水利的时候，社里买来了四部锅驼机，可以浇许多地，但是渠道却占去了一年三熟的良田十五亩。支部书记很心疼，于是就和干部们一起商量作地下渠道，可是有的群众说不行。召开瓦窑工人会议研究烧瓦管，工人也有说不行的，但是，地下瓦管渠道作成以后，大家又都说行了。大家总结了地下渠道有三省、三便利、一防止。三省是省地、省水、省工；三便利是便利交通、便利耕作、便利种植；一防止是防止大水漫灌，低地高地都可以浇。
    这项创造确实是独出心裁，敢想敢作，推广开来，对农业生产将起很大的影响。
    创造跃进锥的陈法田
    河南内黄县岸上农业社打井组长陈法田，贫农出身，学过木匠，识字不多。
    1957年12月，中共内黄县委提出百日水利化的任务，他们社里还有二十八眼井没有打。当时全社只有一套下泉工具，打一眼井需要四十天，二十八眼需要三年多才能打好。
    陈法田认为关键在于改进下泉工具，他考虑如何把单管改为双管，一管凿井，一管吸泥。他作了一个模型，请三位铁匠来作。起初没成功，有人说“他要作成了，太阳就从西边出来！”当然，太阳永远也不会从西边出来，但是在党支部支持下，又经过一位老打井技师帮助，这个文盲终于把双管锥制成了，它两天就可以打一眼两公尺深八十公分直径的井，效率提高了七十九倍多。这下泉工具被群众命名为“跃进锥”。后来，该社又增加了两套工具，二十八眼井一月就打完了。此外，他还创造了手摇水车、打畦器、手摇锯、手摇钻等二十四种工具。
    贺亭的手摇自动倒土机
    一辈子没进过一天学校，今年四十六岁的雇农出身的贺亭，创造了一种被人称为“天上飞”的手摇自动倒土机。
    贺亭是河南省唐河县孙庄乡红星二社的社员。1957年，社里大兴水利，修四个水库。越挖得深，运土越困难。他就和几个人一起商量，创造了手摇自动倒土机，九人操作，每天可以运二百四十多方土，比人担提高效率八倍。
    由于他的创造和社里其他同志的创造，四个水库在三个月内修成了。红星二社从此不再怕旱，也不再怕涝了。
    他还创造了人拉自动扬粪车、打畦器、脚踏抽水机等五种工具。
    巩云长创造弓形运土器
    在大修水利的运动中，运土工具的创造层出不穷，巩云长，这个河南省临颍县凡城回族镇曙光社社员，共青团员，初中二年级的学生，创造了一种“弓形运土器”。
    今年，他们镇上提出百日水利化的号召，要挖二百口坑塘，可是一百六十多人，半月没挖好一口。他就想搞一先进出土工具。他遇到过困难，开始时不适用，但是经过多次修改，最后还是成功了。这当中他得到过县水利办公室一位同志的帮助。这运土器比人挑的效率高五倍。
    1957年冬浇时，他还创造了单管抽水机、压板水车。今年春耕时又创造了一种平锄器。他的压板水车可以适用于大小不同的井口。
    马连臣创造运土工具
    在这次被聘为农业科学院农业机械化研究所特约研究员的“土专家”中，有一个叫做马连臣的二十三岁的青年，他是个下放干部。他是河南省南阳市人，学徒出身，只上过四年学。1951年参加了河南省工商联工作。他下放的地点是河南省太康县常营乡光明一社。
    到社后，正在大搞水利化。他也参加抬土、挑土。起初他累得腰疼腿酸，社员们也很劳累，妇女们有的肩膀压烂了。于是，他决心改变这种情况，花了八昼夜的时间，和群众一起，创造出两种运土工具：吊泥兜，手摇转土带，效率提高了二到十六倍。
    创造发明能手张福来
    张福来，安徽省合肥农具厂的钳工，贫农出身，小学没毕业，但是这个劳动人民当中的巧匠创造出了一种叫做净粮计算机的巧妙的机器。他从1953年就开始了这一研究，前后作过五个模型，又作了一个大模型，经省粮食所鉴定，认为基本成功，到1958年3月全部完成。这个机器是一种联合机器，它能自动地输送、过箱、过风、过磅、计算，每天可完成五十万斤粮食，节省下劳力四百个。这是一项很出色的创造发明。
    他还发明了三轮脚踏水车和木制解放式水车。
    王盛贵创风力水车
    山西省大仁县海北头村农业社社员，贫农出身，四十一岁，只念过四年书的王盛贵，是个不服文化低，钻劲、干劲十足的人。他常说：“就是咱这个土农民，也要钻技术”。解放后，他们村水井由二十眼增加到二百多眼，浇地时要用很多人畜力。他就研究利用风力带动水车。他远在1948年就考虑了，1955年正式试制成功。当地人有的反对，但他毫不低头。
    这水车在三级风的情况下，二丈深的水井，每小时可浇地六分，风力大，效率就更高。现在当地群众都服气了。群众说：“不吃草、不吃料能浇地的牲畜也有了。”他这项发明得到了山西省人民政府的奖励。
    毛其昌创畜力浇尿车
    安徽省太和县业莹乡茨北农业社副主任毛其昌，是个二十七岁的年青人，贫农出身，现有初小程度。他在1956年3月创造了畜力浇尿车。这车形状像平板架车，上面有尿箱，箱后有控制水量和分水等设备。它不但能施追肥而且可以浇地，也可以运输。
    当时农活很忙，家里人又反对，说他瞎胡闹，他只好在夜里加班搞。制成后，用到麦地里去施追肥，不到半天就追完十亩多，不但效率高，而且施得很匀。这才引起了大家的重视。
    他创造的第二个农具是和田机。这是用在旱田改水田后打畦、防漏上。有了这个和田机，就节省下了大批人畜力，使得社里旱田改水田工作可以顺利进行。
    卞维祥创造空中运土机
    卞维祥所创造的运土器，不但是空中运输，而且是土箱自动开关，不但可以手摇，而且可以脚踏。另外，还在辘轳旁加了两个座位，摇的人可以坐下来工作。
    卞维祥是安徽省寿县双门乡安丰二社的木工，今年三十八岁，他从十八岁起就作了木工。
    创造单人手摇脚踏空中运土器，是在1957年大修水利的时候。那时候，社员们从早到晚运塘泥，可是每人每天只能运一方多。卞维祥动了脑筋，是否能用铁丝作轨道，从空中运土。不久，他的运土器做成了，一个人用手摇，工作效率比人力提高五到六倍。他还不断改进，加上了踏板，又加上了座位。
    创造脚踏磨的徐祯武
    徐祯武，四十六岁，贫农出身，湖北省五峰县刘家坪乡农具改革指挥部负责人，念过五年书。
    他从十七岁起就作木匠，心灵手巧，创造发明很多。
    这次带到全国农具展览会来的是今年1月创造的脚踏磨的模型。
    五峰县是山区，许多年来磨面都是用两个圆石头滚。一个整劳动力，一天只能磨三、四十斤，三、五家就有一座磨。
    生产大跃进以后，大家忙生产，快修水利，还要抽一部分人推磨。他自己家里要他妻子一个人整天推磨，才能供应吃饭。
    徐祯武下决心改变这种情况，他创造了脚踏磨，一天可以加工二百七十到三百斤粮食，效率提高了几倍。它只要踏两天，就够全社吃几天，很受群众欢迎，已经在附近推广开了。
    徐祯武的另一项创造是几里长的天线轨道。过去，他们那里的人上山打柴，要走很远路背回来，有了这根轨道，打完柴，一滑，一下就滑到村里了。这轨道还可以运土。
    他还创造了水车、脱谷机、中耕器等。
    龚光炎创造手摇钻石机
    在全国农具展览会上，湖北省长阳县农具合作工厂铁工龚光炎所创造的两种手摇钻石机，引起了人们的普遍注意，有的省订了货，有很多人画了图，准备回去仿制。
    龚光炎今年三十二岁，贫农出身，只读过几年书。但是他的发明创造很出色。
    他们县里搞水利化，修一条百里长渠，要通过山，这困难很大。山洞打不开，渠就修不成功。顾光炎在这种情况下，创造了一种机枪式的手摇钻石机，钻头用的是钻铁的那种。但不行，那钻头能钻铁，不能钻石头。群众说，我们一辈子没看过钻石机。但是他不泄气，区委书记鼓励他干，他们一起干了六天六夜，制造出一种像钢笔尖似的钻头，又在机器上加了三个齿轮，于是成功了，一天能掘进一丈二，效率提高了六倍。可是顾光炎还是不死心，他接着又利用缝纫机的原理，做出了一种缝纫式手摇钻石机，效率提高到每天一丈八。
    省内、省外许多人去长阳参观、订货的很多。在农具展览会上，又有几个省订货。因为这工具可以开矿，开山洞，用处很大。
    龚光炎还创造了锄草器、水车等。
    王玉顺创造双层深耕犁
    深耕，是增产措施当中的重要一项。可是我国很多地方的农民，在没有深耕农具的情况下，只好用铁锨来挖。现在，河南省长葛县增福庙乡先进第一农业社铁业组长王玉顺，这个贫农出身只上过三年私塾的五十多岁的老汉，创造了一种深耕农具——双层深耕犁。
    这是他和社长王水旺共同创造的。1957年11月，县委提出推广深翻地，当时用人工翻，一个劳力一天只能翻一分。王玉顺接受了制造深耕犁的任务，他苦战了三天，失败过三次，终于得到成功。这种犁能犁一尺二到一尺五，一人三畜每天可犁三亩半。这样就提高效率三十四倍。这种犁最受群众欢迎，已在全县推广。
    他还先后创造、改制和仿制了红薯切片机、耙地锄草机、双垅锄、双垅十齿耙等十七种先进工具。
    王克书创玉米点播机
    云南省泸西县木器生产社工人王克书今年已经五十一岁了，钻劲很大。这几年他试制了播种小麦的拉板、薅秧工具，1957年10月又和尚汝桂一起创造了双行玉米点播机和单行玉米点播机。双行玉米播种机每天可以播种十六亩，比旧式工具的效率提高了三倍。
    他还创造了格线机，可以把三股单纱纺成缝衣用的线。
    水泥专家马发喜
    土法专家马发喜，河南省偃师县诸葛乡诸葛村人，农业社长，贫农出身，只念过三年书。
    从1938年起他就和本村马永瑞研究用当地原料（白垩土、红粘土和无烟煤）用土法烧水泥。但旧社会没人支持他们。直到1949年，他们才砌成了一个大炉子，烧出了第一批水泥。水利高潮来了，农村要修很多的水库，需要很多水泥。于是，今年3月，全乡共建立了七个炉子，每天产三十吨水泥，不但供应本乡，而且供应了附近农业社。他们的水泥质量很高，最好的能达到四百号水泥的水平，而且建立了一套科学的操作规程。
    这种土法烧水泥，办法简单易行，解决问题很大。　（待续）
