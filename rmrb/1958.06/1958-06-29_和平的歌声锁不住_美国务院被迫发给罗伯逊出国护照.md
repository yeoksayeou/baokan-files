Xinhua News Agency, June 28th, New York Dispatch: Under pressure from public opinion in the United States and other countries, the U.S. State Department was forced to issue a passport to Paul Robeson, the world-renowned black singer and staunch fighter for peace.

Since 1950, the U.S. State Department has refused to issue Robeson a passport, using the excuse that Robeson refused to answer questions from Congressional investigation committees "regarding participation in the Communist Party." It attempted to use this method to block Robeson's resounding songs of peace and obstruct his participation in the struggle for world peace. However, with the support and solidarity of the American public and the public in other countries, Robeson has steadfastly waged a struggle to obtain a passport and oppose reactionary forces.

Regarding the issuance of his passport, Robeson told a TASS reporter: I thank those who have supported me with their sympathy during this time. Now that I am able to go abroad, I will happily participate in the cultural exchange between the people of our two countries (the United States and the Soviet Union). At the end of July or the beginning of August, I will go to London, and then I hope to go to Moscow, followed by other places.

I have said many times that it would be a great happiness for me to be able to shake the hands of friends in the Soviet Union and personally express my heartfelt sincerity and say "deep gratitude" to them.

### 和平的歌声锁不住  美国务院被迫发给罗伯逊出国护照

    和平的歌声锁不住
    美国务院被迫发给罗伯逊出国护照
    据新华社28日讯　纽约消息：在美国国内和其他国家公众舆论的压力下，美国国务院被迫发给了世界著名的黑人歌唱家、保卫和平的坚贞战士保罗·罗伯逊以出国护照。
    自从1950年以来，美国国务院就一直以罗伯逊拒绝答复国会调查委员会“有关参加共产党”的问题为借口，拒绝发给罗伯逊出国护照。它想用这种办法来封锁住罗伯逊洪亮的和平歌声，阻挠他参加争取世界和平的斗争。但是，在美国公众和其他国家公众的声援和支持下，罗伯逊一直坚毅地进行着争取出国护照和反对反动势力的斗争。
    罗伯逊就他获得出国护照一事对塔斯社记者发表谈话说：我感谢在这一段时间里以自己的同情支持过我的人。现在，我已经可能出国了，我将幸福地参加我们两国（美国和苏联）人民之间的文化交流。7月底或者8月初，我要去伦敦，然后希望能去莫斯科，随后再到其他地方去。
    我已经说过多次了，能在苏联握朋友的手，亲自向他们表达衷心的诚意和说一声“深为感谢”，这对我来说是极大的幸福。
