    Diligent Work-Study Programs Greatly Improve Teaching Quality
    Northeast Institute of Technology Teachers and Students Transform Their Thinking and Master Scientific and Technological Knowledge Through Labor
    (Our reporter Lin Mo reports) The Northeast Institute of Technology in Shenyang is widely carrying out work-study activities. Teachers and students are contributing their share to the great leap forward of the motherland's socialist construction, and in actual production activities, they are more deeply transforming their thinking and more thoroughly mastering scientific and technological knowledge. More than 1,200 students who will graduate this summer have undertaken 48 design tasks for various factories and mines. 90% of the students have replaced the past imaginary graduation designs with actual designs. The 14 designs of the Mining Department are mostly for county industries. The students of the Electrical Power Department are designing a complete set of electrical equipment for a steel rolling mill for Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. The ore dressing specialty of the Nonferrous Metals Department is undertaking the design of a fairly large-scale lead-zinc mine. The more arduous redesign of a blast furnace in a steel plant in Benxi is jointly undertaken by teachers and students from the steel metallurgy, electrical power, and mechanical engineering departments. All graduating students of the Mining Electricity Department have been put into the design work of mine ventilation, drainage, and hoisting machines.
    Students in other classes on campus have also planned various production activities. More than 500 people work in three shifts every day in the on-campus practice factory. Another five or six hundred students go to factories, mines, and the field for internships. More than 1,000 first-year students are responsible for planting vegetables on more than 200 mu of land on campus.
    Most of the more than 100 large and small laboratories on campus have been put into production activities and have actually become comprehensive laboratories for the city. Anshan and Benxi Iron and Steel Companies have both used the school's laboratories for testing.
    The students have a high degree of enthusiasm for work-study programs. Under the guidance of teachers, they have achieved gratifying results in a short period of time. Teachers and students of the third grade of the Electrical Power Department successfully trial-produced an electronic analog computer and a wired broadcasting machine in 20 days, and redesigned and modified an electrical sleep machine, a shortwave electrotherapy machine, and an electrical stimulation machine.
    The work-study activities of the Northeast Institute of Technology have not only created economic value and supported the country's industrial construction, but more importantly, through the work-study activities, teachers and students have a more concrete and profound understanding of the correctness of the socialist education policy. Many teachers have clarified that theory must be combined with practice, and education must serve production. In the past, the course on safety in production was generally neglected in teaching. Those who taught were not enthusiastic, and those who learned were not interested. Everyone believed that these were practical problems in production and had no profound theory or scientific value. Recently, teachers and students went to work in the mines for a period of time, and personally experienced how important production safety is to the lives of workers and the quality of production. Their views on this course have changed. In the past, when metallurgy teachers talked about blast furnaces to students, they always talked about the most advanced, automated ones. This time, when the students went down, the production department asked them to design small blast furnaces with a capacity of several tons, and to make them economical, durable, and simple in structure. The students had to temporarily search through various materials and ask teachers and friends everywhere. The blast furnaces they finally managed to design were neither economical nor simple. Some teachers, who used to talk about textbook theory fluently in the classroom, were at a loss when they saw the machines in the factory, like a tiger trying to eat the sky, unable to start. Some avoided practical problems and walked around the machines. Faced with these real problems, some teachers began to awaken.
    Many students in the Electrical Power Department realized that learning quality can be greatly improved through work-study activities. In the past, when students listened to teachers talk about electrical principles and the structure of electric motors in the classroom, the teachers drew many diagrams on the blackboard, and they took many notes themselves, but they were still confused about the actual structure of the machines. This time, when they encountered actual operation, they couldn't even connect the wires correctly at first. In the process of trial-producing electronic analog computers, electrical sleep machines, and shortwave medical machines, they encountered problems many times. They combined textbook knowledge with repeated experiments and research. After the problems were solved, they raised them to the theoretical level. In this way, the knowledge they learned was practical and profound. The students felt that only when theory is combined with practice is the knowledge they learn truly useful. Teacher Zhou Kongzhang said that in the past, when he prepared lessons, he had to flip through many reference books, comparing them with each other, theory plus theory, principle after principle. He didn't have a grasp of whether it was actually the case. He felt that after actual production, he was more confident when he returned to the classroom. He had experience and examples, and his lectures would be more vivid.
    Teacher Jin Feng experienced the power of the collective in production. When he started to guide students in the trial production of machines, he always lacked confidence and was afraid of not being able to complete it. But in production, because everyone came up with ideas and methods, and got help from various sources, the task was finally completed smoothly. At this time, his mind suddenly opened up. He said: "At first, I was thinking about whether I could do it, and didn't think about whether our collective, whether everyone could do it. Now I see that I am very small; I see that everyone's strength is great."
    Labor production has also cultivated people's sense of responsibility and conservation. When making electrical sleep machines, students understood that if they were not made well, they would not only not cure diseases in the future, but would also harm people. Therefore, when welding each wire joint, they repeatedly checked it and repeatedly said that they should be responsible to the people. People often talk about how a person in a collective is like a screw on a machine. However, every screw must be tightened to play its due role. This time, they discovered that when assembling a wired broadcasting machine, the machine didn't work properly because a screw was not tightened properly, which made everyone work very hard to find the problem. In the past, when students did experiments in the laboratory, many people didn't care about the waste of raw materials. But this time, everyone realized that they were manufacturing products for the country, and that many raw materials were personally bought by the students in the rain, hungry, and running around everywhere. Therefore, they paid great attention to saving materials in production, and picked up every little bit of material.
    Some students went to factories to be apprentices and saw that the old workers were disciplined, punctual, and conscientious and responsible for their work, operating a machine to produce the same thing, day after day. At first glance, this seems very ordinary, but it is impossible to do when put on oneself. On the contrary, some students are picky and choosy, like the new and dislike the old, and are sometimes tight and sometimes loose when they work. In contrast, they can more and more realize the excellent qualities of the working class, which are ordinary and precious.
    Therefore, the students all feel that through the work-study method, ideological transformation is in-depth and concrete, knowledge is learned comprehensively and profoundly, and at the same time, the body can be exercised in labor.

    勤工俭学大大提高教学质量
    东北工学院师生在劳动中改造思想，掌握科学技术知识
    本报讯　记者林沫报道：沈阳东北工学院广泛开展勤工俭学活动，师生们都要在祖国社会主义建设大跃进中贡献出自己的一分力量，并在实际生产活动中，更深入地改造思想，更透彻地掌握科学技术知识。将在今年暑假毕业的一千二百多个同学，承担了各厂矿的四十八项设计任务，90％的同学都以实际设计代替了过去的假想式的毕业设计。采矿系的十四项设计，大部分都是县工业。电力系的同学正在给武汉钢铁公司设计一个轧钢机的全套电力设备。有色金属系选矿专业担负着一个规模相当大的铅锌矿的设计任务。更为繁重的本溪炼铁厂某高炉的改建设计，则由钢铁冶炼、电力、机械三系的部分师生共同担任。矿电系的应届毕业同学已全部投入了矿井的通风、排水和卷扬机的设计工作。
    校内其他班级的同学也有计划地安排了各种生产活动。有五百多人每天分三班在校内实习工厂参加劳作。还有五六百学生分别到厂矿及野外进行实习。一年级的一千多同学，在校内负责二百多亩地的蔬菜种植。
    校内的大、小一百多个试验室，绝大部分已投入生产活动，实际上已成为全市综合性的试验室。鞍山和本溪钢铁公司都已利用该校的试验室进行试验。
    同学们对勤工俭学有很高的积极性，在老师的指导下，短时间内已获得了可喜的成绩。电力系三年级的师生，在二十天时间内，试制成功了电子模拟计算机、有线广播机，重新设计和改装了电力睡眠机、超短波电疗机、电力刺激机。
    东北工学院的勤工俭学活动，不仅创造了经济价值，支援了国家的工业建设，更重要的是通过勤工俭学的活动，师生们对社会主义的教育方针的正确性有了比较具体和深刻的体会。不少教师明确了理论必须结合实际，教育必须为生产服务。过去对生产中的安全这门课，在教学中普遍受到轻视。教的人不起劲，学的人没兴趣。都认为这是生产中的实际问题，没有什么高深的理论和科学价值。最近师生们下矿井工作过一个时期，亲身经历到生产的安全对职工的生命和生产的好坏多么重要，对这门课的看法就不同了。冶金系教师过去对同学讲高炉，都是讲最先进的、自动化的。这次同学们下去，生产部门要他们设计几吨容量的小高炉，而且要经济、耐用、构造简单。同学们只得临时查遍各种资料，到处求师访友，最后勉强设计出来的高炉，却是既不经济，又不简单。有的教师，过去在课堂上对书本理论讲的头头是道，但一到工厂见到机器，却像老虎吃天，无处下手，有的就躲避实际问题，绕开机器走路。面对着这些现实问题，有些教师开始觉悟了。
    电力系的许多同学体会到，通过勤工俭学活动，可以大大提高学习质量。同学们过去在课堂上听老师讲电学原理、电动机的构造，老师在黑板上画了很多图，自己也记了很多笔记，但机器的构造到底什么样，自己脑子里还是稀里糊涂。这次一遇到实际操作，开始连线路都接不对。在试制电子模拟计算机、电力睡眠机、超短波医疗机的操作过程中，多次遇到问题，结合书本知识，反复试验研究，当问题解决之后，再提高到理论上，这样学得的知识就实际和深刻了。同学们从而感觉到，只有在理论联系实际的情况下，所学得的才是真正有用的知识。周孔章老师说，过去他备课，讲一个问题要翻很多参考书，互相参考对照，理论加理论，原则套原则，究竟实际是否如此，自己也没有把握。他觉得经过实际生产，再上讲堂也理直气壮了，有经验、有实例，讲起课来也就会生动了。
    金丰老师在生产中体会到集体力量。开始由他指导同学试制机器的时候，他一直缺乏信心，怕完不成。但在生产中由于大家出主意，想办法，多方面取得帮助，终于顺利完成了任务。这时，他的心胸才豁然开朗，他说：“起初我想的都是我行不行，没有想到我们的集体，我们大家行不行。现在我才看到自己很渺小；看到我们大家，力量就伟大了。”
    劳动生产也培养了人们的责任心和节约观念。在作电力睡眠机的时候，同学们懂得，如果作得不好，将来使用起来不但不能治病，反而会害人。因此在焊每一根线路接头的时候，都反复检查，一再提出要对人民负责。人们也常谈到，一个人在集体中，好比一架机器上的螺丝钉。但是，任何一个螺丝钉都要把它上紧，起到应有的作用。这次他们就发现，在装制有线广播机的时候，由于一个螺丝钉没有上好，机器就不好使，害得大家费了很大劲，才找到了毛病所在。过去同学在试验室作试验的时候，很多人对原材料的浪费是毫不在乎的。而这次大家都意识到自己是在为国家制造产品，许多原材料又是同学们亲自冒着雨、饿着肚子，各处跑着买来的，因此在生产中都很注意节省材料，一丁点的东西都要把它捡起来。
    有的同学到工厂去当学徒，见老工人守纪律、守时刻，对工作认真负责，把着一台机器生产一样东西，数年如一日。乍看起来，这事很平凡，但放在自己身上却做不到。相反的，有些同学干起活来，却挑肥捡瘦，喜新厌旧，忽紧忽松。相形之下，就越能处处体会到平凡而又可贵的工人阶级的优良品质。
    所以，同学们都感到，通过勤工俭学的办法，改造思想深入具体，学知识全面又深刻，同时在劳动中还能锻炼身体。
