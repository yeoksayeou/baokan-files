Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Moscow. According to TASS, Professor Shemyakin, a Soviet authority on organic chemistry, said that applying gibberellin, a "metabolic product of Fusarium" with great growth-stimulating ability, to the soil can make cabbage heads grow to a diameter of five meters and carrots grow to one meter long.

Professor Shemyakin told TASS reporters that gibberellin gives chemists and biologists unexpectedly opportunities to fundamentally transform agriculture. Applying five grams of gibberellin per hectare of land is enough to obtain huge vegetables. Moreover, it can shorten the growing season from several months to several weeks, making it possible to solve the problem of growing crops in the frozen soil of the Far North and in desert areas.

　　苏联化学家使用赤霉素  能使蔬菜长得快而又大
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联有机化学权威谢米亚舍教授说，把具有很大刺激生长能力的赤霉素“镰刀菌的代谢产物”施于土中，能使甘蓝的头长到直径五公尺大，能使葫萝卜长到一公尺长。
    谢米亚舍对塔斯社记者说，赤霉素使化学家和生物学家有了根本改造农业的臆想不到的机会。每公顷土地施用五克赤霉素就足以获得巨大的蔬菜。而且它还能使植物生长期从几个月缩短到几个星期，因为有可能解决极北的冻土区和沙漠地区种植农作物的问题了。
