　　The Most Touching Art
　　Ma Shaobo
    I watched the performance of the spare-time performance team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Rehabilitation Center with infinite respect, and I simply forgot that I was appreciating art. My heart soared with the hearts of these heroes.

    These Chinese "Pauls" are not only heroes in defending peace and the motherland, and heroes on the production front, but also vanguard fighters in the cultural revolution and good hands in literary and artistic work!

    These good sons and daughters of the motherland once galloped on the front lines of defending peace and the motherland. They shed blood gloriously and their limbs were injured. However, what difficulties in the world can frighten or stop the heroic men taught by the Party!

    Comrades Fan Deyou and Li Zhenghua, who were paralyzed, learned to assemble mineral earphones and radios; Comrades Chen Shaokang, who had both lower limbs amputated, and Zhou Shaocheng, who was paralyzed, learned to repair shoes and hand-cranked tricycles; Comrades Zhang Denggui and Zhou Rong, who were paralyzed, learned to weave palm fiber grass bags and slippers; some could show movies, knit sweaters, sew, embroider, grow vegetables, and raise pigs; some were elected as people's representatives of districts and townships, serving as party branch secretaries, agricultural cooperative directors, accountants, and teachers of people's schools... Among these production heroes, so many good hands in literary and artistic work have emerged. Such beautiful dances, such wonderful music, singing, and majestic poems have appeared.

    People's wings of imagination are always easy to fall behind the reality. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, who would have believed that Comrade Zhang Jiachen, whose hands were amputated, could play the organ so beautifully and accurately with his two arm bones! Who would have believed that Comrade Yi Ruyuan, whose left hand was amputated and one eye was blind, could play such a moving flute sound with one hand! The soprano solo by Comrade He Changjun, who is paralyzed in the lower limbs, the baritone solo by Comrades Gou Zhongyu and Huang Tianran, whose hands were amputated, the harmonica playing by Comrade Yang Daxin, whose hands were amputated, the accordion playing by Comrades Yang Chaoan and Xu Houxian, who are blind, and the ethnic musical instrument playing by Comrade Zhou Zinong, who is blind, have all reached a very high level. It is no exaggeration to say that some professional artists should be ashamed of them.

    Comrade Zhang Jiachen's poem recitation made people's blood boil. This poem is called "Our Hearts Are Forever Loyal to the Party" and is the work of Comrade Liu Yusheng, a specially disabled revolutionary soldier. This is the heroes' oath of loyalty to the Party and the motherland, and it is a symbol of all revolutionaries being forever loyal to the Party and the cause of communism.

    Let us cheer for the heroes' beautiful dances, wonderful music, singing, and majestic poems! Let us cheer for the most touching art and the most lovable people! They are bravely marching towards the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. Their tenacious revolutionary will and great optimistic spirit have deeply moved me and will surely move everyone. "Though physically disabled, the will remains strong." What should we, who are physically sound, do? "Fearless soldiers" have already broken into the art garden, which is often regarded as a mysterious palace. Then what should our professional literary and artistic workers do?

    When the program was in progress, I was thinking; when the purple velvet curtain fell, I was thinking; when the applause was thunderous, I was thinking; when I shook hands and talked happily with the heroes, I was thinking. I thought today was not about listening to songs and watching dances, but about taking a solid lesson in revolutionary comparison!

　　最动人的艺术
　　马少波
    我怀着无限崇敬的心情，看了四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队的表演，简直忘记了是在欣赏艺术，我的心跟着这些英雄们的心一起飞腾起来了。
    这些中国的“保尔”，不但是保卫和平、保卫祖国的功臣，生产战线上的英雄；而且是文化革命的先锋战士、文艺工作的好手！
    这些祖国的好儿女，曾经驰骋在保卫和平、保卫祖国的最前线，他们光荣地流过血，肢体伤残了；但是，天下有什么困难能吓得倒挡得住党教养出来的英雄好汉！
    瘫痪的范德友、李正华同志学会了装配矿石耳机和收音机；双下肢截除的陈绍康、瘫痪的周绍成等同志学会了修理皮鞋和三轮手摇车；瘫痪的张登贵、周荣等同志学会了编织棕丝草包和拖鞋；有的会放电影、打毛线、缝纫、绣花、种菜、养猪；有的当选为区、乡人民代表，担任党支部书记、农业社社长、会计、民校教师……。就是在这些生产好汉中间出现了这么多文艺工作的好手。出现了这样优美的舞蹈、这样美妙的音乐、歌唱和气壮山河的诗篇。
    人的想像的翅膀总是容易落后于现实的，如果不是亲眼看到，谁会相信双手切肢的张家琛同志用两只臂骨弹奏风琴，竟会如此的美妙和精确！谁会相信左手切肢一目失明的易如元同志一只手扶笛竟会吹出那样动人的笛声！下肢瘫痪的何长俊同志的女声独唱，双手切肢的苟中玉、黄天然同志的男声独唱，双手切肢的杨达信同志的口琴演奏，双目失明的杨朝安、徐厚贤同志的手风琴演奏，双目失明的周自农同志的民族乐器演奏，都达到了很高的水平，一点也不夸张的说，有些专业的艺术家对之应有愧色。
    张家琛同志的诗朗诵，使人热血沸腾。这首诗叫作“我们的心永远忠于党”，是特等残废革命军人刘渝生同志的作品，这是英雄们对党对祖国忠心耿耿的誓言，是所有革命者永远忠于党、忠于共产主义事业的象征。
    让我们为英雄们优美的舞蹈、美妙的音乐、歌唱和气壮山河的诗篇而欢呼！为最动人的艺术、最可爱的人而欢呼吧！他们正在向技术革命、文化革命勇猛进军，他们的顽强的革命意志和伟大的乐观主义精神，深深地感动了我，也一定会感动每一个人。“人残志不残”，而我们身体完好的人应该怎样呢？“无畏的士兵”已经闯进常被人看作神秘之宫的艺术花园里来了，那末我们专业的文艺工作者又该当如何呢？
    当节目进行的时候，我在想；当紫丝绒幕落下来的时候，我在想；当掌声如雷的时候，我在想；和英雄们握手言欢的时候，我在想。我想今天哪里是来听歌看舞，倒是结结实实地上了一次革命评比的大课！
