　　Laying the Ideological Foundation for Next Year's Bumper Harvest
    Shangjiluo Township Launches a Grand Debate on Wheat Technology Innovation
    (Our report) Taiyuan, Shanxi - To prepare for a bumper wheat harvest next summer, Shangjiluo Township in Hongzhao County, a major wheat-producing area on the Jinnan Plain, recently launched a mass-based grand debate on wheat technology innovation. This debate greatly liberated thought and promoted various preparatory activities such as seed selection, tool reform, and opening up sources of fertilizer.
    The township-wide grand debate began on May 1st. It employed a variety of lively forms, such as accounting, comparisons, visits, and on-site experiments. The debate focused on whether the new technical measures were good and worth promoting.
    After a month of great airing of views and grand debate, advanced technical measures have taken root in the hearts of the people. Commune members have put forward many rational suggestions and opinions for implementing these new technical measures. Many agricultural cooperatives have also put forward higher technical requirements, such as changing the original deep plowing of eight inches to deep plowing of one foot, and increasing the application of base fertilizer from 10,000 jin per mu to 15,000 or 20,000 jin, and popularizing superior varieties in all wheat fields. The Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative in Xiajiluo Village has also decided to use field selection and other methods this year to ensure pure varieties.

　　打下明年丰收的思想基础
    上纪落乡开展小麦技术革新大辩论
    本报讯　山西为明年夏季小麦丰收做好准备，晋南平原产麦区洪赵县上纪落乡最近开展群众性的小麦技术革新大辩论。经过这次辩论，大大解放了思想，推动了选种、改革工具、开辟肥源等各项准备活动。
    全乡大辩论从5月1日开始。运用了算账、对比、参观和实地试验等多种多样生动活泼的形式。辩论了新的技术措施好不好，值得不值得推广等问题。
    经过历时一个月的大鸣大放、大辩论，先进技术措施深入人心，社员群众为贯彻这些新的技术措施，提出了许多合理化建议和意见，不少农业社还提出了更高的技术要求，如把原来深耕八寸改为深耕一尺，亩施基肥万斤分别改为一万五、两万斤，和在全部麦田中普及优种。下纪落村雄火农业社还决定今年用场选、田间选等多种方法，做到纯种。
