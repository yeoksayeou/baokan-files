    Using Biogas to Promote Increased Sweet Potato Production
    Wei Shaoqiu, a Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi corn production model worker, experimented with using biogas to grow sweet potatoes in the youth production team of the Jianjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Huaiqun Township, Luocheng County. He and the youth production team he led divided one mu of sweet potato land into three large rows. On each row, they erected a wooden A-frame, one and a half zhang high. Under the frame, they piled a mixture of cow dung, fertile mud, and weeds. Then, using fertile mud mixed with base fertilizer, they piled it up from both sides along the wooden frame, forming a high ridge like the head of a reservoir dam. Then, on both sides of this high ridge, they planted sweet potatoes from bottom to top, arranging them in layers like stairs, with a total of fourteen layers. At the top of the wooden frame, they inserted a bamboo tube, from which water dripped down to keep the inside moist. A walkway was left under the wooden frame at the head of the ridge to regularly replace the fresh cow dung with the already decomposed cow dung from inside. The frame would then continuously emit biogas in all directions. After the sweet potato roots absorbed the biogas, they became both drought-resistant and able to maintain appropriate temperature and nutrients. In this way, 360,000 seedlings could be planted per mu. If each seedling yields eight tubers, and each seedling yields twelve ounces of potatoes, then approximately 270,000 jin could be harvested per mu.

    利用沼气促进甘薯增产
    广西僮族自治区玉米丰产模范韦绍裘，在罗城县怀群乡建江农业社青年生产队试用沼气种红薯。他和他所领导的青年生产队，将一亩红薯地开成三个大厢，每厢上用木头搭一个人字塔形的架子，架高一丈五尺，架下堆满牛粪、肥泥、杂草等混合物，再用肥泥混合基肥，从两边沿着木架往上堆，堆成像水库坝首一样的高畦。然后在这高畦的两边，从底到顶都种上红薯，一层层摆成楼梯形，共摆十四层。木架顶上，插一根竹管，从竹管淋下水去，使里面保持湿润。再在畦头的木架底下留一条人行道，经常将新鲜牛粪换出里面已腐熟的牛粪，架内便会源源不绝地向四面发出沼气。红薯根部吸收沼气之后，既能抗旱，又能保持适当的温度和养分。这样一亩地能种三十六万株薯苗，如每苗结薯八蔸，以每苗收薯十二两计算，那么，每亩田约可收二十七万斤。
