Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: China's geological work has broken out of its narrow confines. Based on the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, it is advancing along the broad path of the whole Party running geology and the entire people running geological undertakings. This path will accelerate the pace of geological work, bring about a new situation of a hundred flowers blooming, and thus provide more abundant mineral resources for the great development of national industry.

According to this newly opened road, most of the special zones and counties in each province and autonomous region of China will gradually establish geological organizations, further strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels over geological work, and at the same time, massively mobilize the masses to report mineral discoveries and strengthen the inspection of these reported sites.

Now, the Ministry of Geology has preliminarily determined the plan for the next five years based on this road. After this plan is realized, China will not only have more large raw material mineral bases for steel, non-ferrous metallurgy, fuel, and chemicals than it does now, but also countless medium and small mineral deposits, distributed throughout the provinces and even special zones and counties. In this way, it can not only guarantee the various mineral resources needed for the great development of China's industry and make the distribution of industry more rational, but also better realize the policy of simultaneously promoting central industry and local industry and combining large, medium, and small enterprises.

Seeking minerals by looking for mines and following the mass line has been a consistent method of prospecting advocated in New China since the establishment of relatively formal geological work, thus ensuring the mineral resources urgently needed for national construction. However, in the past, some people inappropriately emphasized the scientific and technical nature of geological work, to some extent mystifying it, as if only relying on geological "experts" could get things done. As a result, geological work could only be limited to the narrow circle of the central competent department, ignoring the leadership of local Party committees at all levels. There was also a lack of specific organizational measures for the masses' reporting of mineral discoveries, hindering the rapid development of geological work.

Recently, the Party Group of the Ministry of Geology, in the rectification movement, seriously criticized the above-mentioned non-political tendencies. The Ministry of Geology believes that China is a country with vast land and many mountains, and a long history of mining. As early as the Yin and Shang dynasties two thousand years ago, iron ore was mined, and iron tools were used in the Zhou dynasty. Therefore, not only are there many mining relics left by our ancestors, but there are also many "local" engineers among the masses who have been both workers and farmers for generations. For example, some farmers in southern Jiangxi can roughly identify the grade of tungsten-tin ore with a glance. An old worker in Leping County, Jiangxi, can recognize which parts of the sandstone belong to the mineral layer without testing. Many large mines discovered in China during the First Five-Year Plan, such as Zhongtiaoshan, Jingtieshan, Ma'anshan, and Baiyunebo, were mostly found from the masses' information and the mining relics of ancestors. Especially after the policy of simultaneously promoting central industry and local industry was put forward, the enthusiasm for finding minerals is now even higher in various places. Many county Party secretaries personally lead the masses to explore for treasures in the deep mountains. Provinces such as Yunnan, Fujian, and Zhejiang have established geological organizations in almost every special zone, transferring large numbers of cadres and students to run geological training classes. Some counties have also set up full-time mineral reporting inspectors and mineral specimen exhibition rooms. The number of mineral discoveries reported by the masses in various places has also greatly increased compared to the past. Therefore, it can be predicted that if China's geological work further thoroughly implements the mass line prospecting method, it will surely be able to quickly survey and explore the rich underground resources.

Now, in order to realize this path, the Ministry of Geology has transferred all of its prospecting and exploration teams to the provinces and autonomous regions, which will be uniformly arranged by the Party committees of the provinces and autonomous regions according to their needs and technical strength to arrange geological work in their provinces.

### 地质部门确定新方针  跳出小天地  大家办地质

　　地质部门确定新方针
    跳出小天地  大家办地质
    据新华社2日讯  我国地质工作已经从狭小的圈子里跳出来，根据党的社会主义建设的总路线，正在沿着全党办地质、全民办地质事业的宽阔道路前进。这条道路将加快地质工作的速度，给它带来一个百花盛开的新局面，从而为全国工业大发展提供更充足的矿产资源。
    按照这条新开辟的道路，今后我国每个省和自治区的大部分专区和县都将逐步建立起地质机构，进一步加强各级党委对地质工作的领导，同时将大规模地发动群众报矿和加强对报矿点的检查。
    现在，地质部已经根据这条道路初步确定了今后五年的规划。这个规划实现以后，我国将不但拥有比现在多得更多的钢铁、有色冶金、燃料和化工等的大型原料矿物基地，同时还将有无数的中小型矿产地，分布在全国各省以至专区和县。这样，既可以保证我国工业大发展所需的各种矿产资源，使工业的分布更加合理，而且使中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大中小型企业相结合的方针更好地实现。
    就矿找矿和走群众路线，这是新中国自建立比较正规的地质工作以来一贯提倡的探矿方法，因而也保证了国家建设所迫切需要的矿产资源。但是过去由于有人不适当地强调了地质工作的科学性和技术性，在某种程度上把地质工作神秘化起来，似乎只有依靠地质“专家”才能办事，因而使地质工作始终只能局限在中央主管部的狭小圈子里，忽视了依靠各级地方党委的领导；对群众的报矿工作也缺乏具体的组织措施，妨碍了地质工作的迅速发展。
    最近，地质部党组在整风运动中，严肃批判了以上那种非政治倾向。地质部认为，我国是地大山多的国家，采矿历史悠久，早在公元前二千年的殷商时代就开采铁矿，周代已采用铁器。因此，不但祖先留下的采矿遗迹多，群众中祖祖辈辈曾经是亦工亦农的“土”工程师也很多。如赣南的有些农民拾起一块钨锡矿石，用眼睛一看就能大致不差的鉴定品位。江西乐平县有个老工人，不经过化验，就能认识那些砂岩是属于矿层的那些部位。我国在第一个五年计划期间发现的很多大矿，如中条山、镜铁山、马鞍山、白云鄂博等，大部分是从群众的情报和祖先采矿遗迹中找到的。特别是当中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针提出以后，目前各地找矿的积极性更高。很多县委书记亲自带领群众到深山探宝；云南、福建、浙江等省差不多每个专区都建立了地质机构，抽调大批干部和学生举办地质训练班训练，有些县还设立了专职的报矿检查员和矿物标本陈列室；各地群众报矿的件数也比过去大大增加。因此可以预见，如果我国地质工作进一步彻底实行走群众路线的探矿方法，一定能把丰富的地下资源很快勘探出来。
    现在，地质部为实现这条道路，已经把所属的普查勘探队伍，全部下放到省和自治区，将由各省、自治区的党委根据需要和技术力量，统一安排本省的地质工作。
