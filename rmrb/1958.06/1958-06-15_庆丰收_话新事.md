Celebrating the Harvest, Talking About New Things
\tWritten by our reporters collectively

\tChairman Mao, the Communist Party,
\tCare for the people like parents;
\tLeading us to build water conservancy,
\tConquering nature brings prosperity to all.
\tThe past waves of water become waves of wheat,
\tBarren land becomes granaries;
\tMen, women, old and young, all are joyous,
\tHarvesting wheat is like going to the battlefield;
\tThe sickle is the submachine gun,
\tRegardless of the hot sun,
\tNot afraid of sweat soaking clothes,
\tDay and night are no different,
\tFighting in one breath until dawn,
\tThe bountiful wheat enters the threshing ground!

This is a scene of Henan farmers singing about this year's wheat harvest and their enthusiasm during the harvest. During those days of rejoicing and celebrating the harvest, reporters visited Meng County on the banks of the Yellow River, Yanshi on the Loess Plateau of western Henan, the sandy area of eastern Henan in the old course of the Yellow River, Dengfeng at the foot of Mount Song, Lushan in the Funiu Mountains, and the famous Yellow River flooded area. Everywhere they witnessed new signs of the harvest and heard new stories. Now, we select a few small snippets to report to our readers.

An Elderly “Five Guarantees” Man Must Harvest a Few Stalks

In the Yuetan Agricultural Cooperative of Yanshi County, which produces a thousand catties of wheat per mu, the reporter saw wheat stacks on both sides of the Yi River like many screens erected there. A ferry that can hold fifty or sixty people is transporting more than two hundred and thirty mu of high-yield wheat to the opposite bank day and night. They transported it here for three days and three nights, and there was still a lot left, forcing the cooperative to select another group of strong laborers to wade across the river and carry it for a day and a night. The reporter asked them why this year's wheat was so difficult to transport. They replied that if it were like the wheat of previous years, with each mu yielding one load, a boat of this size would only need one morning to transport it all. This year's wheat grows so well that it is difficult to transport. Today, from three o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock now, only seven or eight mu of wheat have been transported back.

The wheat harvest here has excited everyone. Liu Shizi, a "Five Guarantees" elderly man in this cooperative, is seventy-eight years old this year. Seeing that the wheat was so good, he painstakingly requested the cooperative to allow him to participate in the wheat harvest. Liu Yingxiang, the secretary of the CCP branch in the cooperative, thought that he was deaf and blind and not suitable for going to the field to harvest wheat, so he said to him: "Many people from other places come here to see our wheat this year. Why don't you boil some tea at home and entertain the guests!" The words of the Party branch secretary annoyed the old man. He said, "I have never harvested such good wheat as this year in all my years. I must harvest a few stalks no matter what." After speaking, he shook himself and walked away with a sickle, and no one could stop him.

The Experience of Old Farmers is No Longer Accurate

In Meng County, where "one season crosses the Yellow River," the reporter heard this little story: When estimating production in the past, old farmers were always regarded as sages. People say, "The eyes of old farmers are like scales," which seems not to be wrong. The old farmers would stand in the field, gather the wheat stalks with both hands, then hold the ears of wheat, think for a while, and then say: 180 catties per mu, just watch! After threshing and weighing, it was guaranteed to be within three to five catties. But this year, old farmers generally reported that their experience was no longer accurate. In the Dongguan Cooperative of Meng County, the reporter saw Zhao Qingling, Zhang Hejun, and several other old farmers estimating production. The wheat here was taller than their shoulders, and each stalk had fifty or sixty grains. The old men gathered the wheat stalks back and forth, holding a handful of ears here and picking up a handful of ears there, murmuring for a long time, but still couldn't estimate the yield. The cadres and the masses next to them were all anxious, urging them to say a number quickly. The old men had no choice but to say: "Although we have lived for sixty or seventy years, we have never seen such good wheat. Our old experience can only estimate low yields. We can't estimate such high yields!"

Women Break the Rules and Enter the Field

The wheat harvest in Malou Township, Lushan County, brought women to the threshing ground. This is simply a rare event in this wheat harvest. In previous years, women were not allowed to enter the field at all. As soon as they came, they were driven out by the men, who said that women had "a tainted air" that would reduce wheat production. But this year, the wheat harvest was abundant, there was too much work, and the men alone could not handle it, so they broke the old rules and had to let the women enter the field. When the reporter visited a women's threshing ground in the Xingfu Agricultural Cooperative, a middle-aged woman told the reporter that they had threshed a field of wheat that day, which was originally estimated to yield three hundred catties per mu, but they actually threshed more than four hundred catties. Then she jokingly said to a male member of the cooperative who was guiding them in threshing: "Women entering the field actually increased the wheat yield. Look how conservative your previous estimates were." The male member said nothing, just laughed. Another woman held a handful of wheat seeds and said to the reporter: "Look, how good the first batch of wheat is. We must dry it well and winnow it clean, and store it separately to pay the public grain." She said that this was to repay the Communist Party for leading them to obtain a great harvest, and to thank Chairman Mao for liberating the minds of men and women.

Li Tingjun, the secretary of the CCP Malou Township Party Committee, told the reporter that this year the masses were no longer arguing about how much public grain to hand over and how much surplus grain to sell. The question they are arguing about this year is who should vacate how many houses to use as warehouses! The township has held several meetings on this issue, and it has not yet been properly resolved. Some cooperatives are still worried about not having enough places to store the wheat.

Children Pick Up Wheat Like Little Tigers

"Shoes worn out, waists bent, not letting a single ear remain in the field." This is the determination and oath of the children's wheat picking team of the Gongtong No. 3 Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County. The Gongtong Cooperative's children's wheat picking team has more than one hundred and twenty members. Like adults, during the wheat harvest season, they go to the fields as soon as the rooster crows, carrying baskets, picking up ears of wheat while singing songs, each looking like a little tiger. Adults cut one plot, they pick one plot, cut one mu, pick one mu, and rush to wherever there are ears of wheat. Once, dozens of young team members went to the field of the Houshuangmiao Production Team to pick up wheat and were stopped by the members of the team. They composed a quick-rhyme song and sang: Houshuangmiao, what a mess, a large piece of wheat is scattered, asking you to pick it, you don't pick it, people pick it and you get anxious, really shameless. The members of Houshuangmiao listened and made a self-criticism on the spot, and promised to improve the quality of wheat cutting. This children's wheat picking team picked up more than five thousand catties in five days.

The Last Individual Household Asks to Join the Cooperative

In the large wheat fields of the Wutong Agricultural Cooperative in Meng County, one piece is like another, the wheat is four feet high, the ears are three inches long, and you can't see the edge at a glance. It is estimated that the minimum yield per mu is eight hundred catties. Strangely, in the middle of this large wheat field, there is a small, sparse piece of short wheat, the ears are small and the stalks are thin, the ears are only about one inch long, and the wheat stalks are only two feet tall. It is estimated that the yield per mu is at most two hundred catties. Party Branch Secretary Dang Xiuguo told the reporter that this wheat field caused them a lot of trouble. In the spring, when the county was evaluating and visiting the elimination of third-class wheat seedlings, because this third-class wheat could not be eliminated, a yellow flag was inserted several times. It turned out that this piece of wheat belonged to Dang Xiuzhong, an individual household. He had a livestock and a waterwheel, as well as two laborers, and thought he could outperform the cooperative. When the cooperative was applying smoked fertilizer, his family worked hard to make adobe and build kilns, busy for a while. The cooperative applied 30,000 catties of fertilizer to the wheat, but he only applied 7,000 catties. The cooperative irrigated the wheat fields seven times, but his two laborers pushed the waterwheel, one person changing the furrows, and it took a lot of effort to irrigate only three times. He neither believed in close planting nor replanted seedlings, always sticking to the old method of planting wheat. As a result, his wheat was not good and he lost face for the whole village. The cooperative once sent people to help transform the third-class wheat, but because the foundation was too poor, it still did not grow well. In this way, he, the last individual household in the village, finally surrendered. Now, he has formally applied to the cooperative committee to join the cooperative, and the cooperative has approved his application.

In the days of harvest, farmers throughout the province are all overjoyed, and they can't help but sing:

\tThe general line shines brightly,
\tOur villages have undergone great changes,
\tGolden wheat fills the granaries,
\tHappy days are boundless,
\tThank Chairman Mao,
\tThank the Communist Party!

    庆丰收　话新事
    本报记者集体采写
    毛主席、共产党
    关心百姓像爹娘
    领导咱们修水利
    征服自然万民康
    过去的水浪变麦浪
    贫瘠土地成粮仓
    男女老少喜洋洋
    收麦好比上战场
    镰刀就是冲锋枪
    那管天热太阳晒
    不怕汗珠湿衣裳
    黑夜白天没两样
    一气战到大天亮
    丰收的麦子进了场！
    这是河南农民歌唱今年小麦丰收的情景和他们在麦收中的干劲。在那万民欢腾，喜庆丰收的日子里，记者们分头访问了黄河畔的孟县，豫西黄土高原的偃师，黄河故道的豫东沙区，中岳嵩山脚下的登封，伏牛山区的鲁山和著名的黄泛区，到处目睹丰收新气象，耳闻新故事，现在选择其中几个小片断，汇报给读者。
    五保老人也要割几棵
    在偃师县亩产千斤小麦的岳滩农业社里，记者看到这个社伊河两岸的麦堆像许多屏风那样地树立在那儿。伊河渡口的一只能容纳五、六十人的渡船，正在夜以继日地把二百三十多亩丰产小麦运往对岸。他们整整在这里运了三天三夜还剩下很多，最后迫使社里又挑选一批强劳力，淌水搬运了一天一夜。记者曾问他们今年的小麦为啥这样难运，他们回答说，如果像往年那样的麦子，每亩收一挑子，有这么大的船只需一个上午就可以运完了。今年的小麦长的好，也就难运了，今天从清晨三点钟运到现在的十点钟，才运回七、八亩麦子。
    这里的小麦丰收，激动了每个人的心弦。这个社的五保户刘狮子，今年七十八岁了，他看到小麦这样好，苦心要求社里让他参加麦收。中共社支部书记刘应祥认为他耳聋眼花，不适宜下地割麦，便对他说：“今年外地来到咱这里参观小麦的人很多，你在家里烧点茶水，招待招待客人吧！”党支部书记的话，气恼了这位老人，他说：“我长这么大年纪，从未割过像今年这样好的麦子，无论如何也要割几棵。”说罢，抖抖擞擞的拿着镰刀走了，谁也劝阻不了他。
    老农的经验不灵了
    记者在“一季过黄河”的孟县，听到了这样一个小故事：历来估产的时候，都以老农为圣人。人们说：“老农的眼睛是杆秤”，这话似不差，老农们在地头一站，两手一拢麦棵，再握一下麦穗，低头盘算一番，一张口：打一百八，看吧！打完场一过秤，保险上下不差三、五斤。可是今年，老农普遍反映自己的经验不灵了。在孟县东关社，记者看到赵庆令、张合军等几个老农在估产，这里的麦高过肩，一棵麦有五、六十粒。几个老人把麦棵拢来拢去，东握一把麦穗，西捡一把麦穗，嘀咕了半天，还是估不出个边来，旁边的干部和群众都等急了，一再催他们快说出个数来，老头们没办法，只好说：“我们虽然活了六、七十岁，但是从未见过这样好的麦子，我们的老经验能估低产，像这样高产，我们估不灵了！”
    妇女破规忙上场
    鲁山县马楼乡的小麦丰收，使妇女上了打麦场。这简直是这个麦收中的奇闻。因为往年这里的妇女根本不能上场，一来就被男人赶了出去，他们说妇女有“骚气”，会使小麦减产。可是今年小麦丰收了，活多了，光靠男人便忙不过来了，就打破了旧规，不能不让妇女上场了。记者在幸福农业社的一个妇女打麦场上参观的时候，一个中年妇女告诉记者：她们那天打的一场麦，原来估计亩产三百斤，可是她们却实打了四百多斤。接着她打趣地对在这里指导她们打场的一位男社员说：“妇女上场，麦子倒打多了，你看你们以前估计的产量多保守。”这位男社员一声不响，只是发笑。另一个妇女拿着一把麦籽对记者说：“你看，第一场麦子多么好，我们一定要晒干扬净，另外放着缴公粮。”她说，这样，一来是为了报答共产党领导咱获得了大丰收，二来是为了感谢毛主席使咱男女思想得到了大解放。
    中共马楼乡党委书记李廷钧对记者说，今年究竟缴多少公粮和卖多少余粮，群众都不争吵了，今年争吵的问题是谁该腾出多少房子来作仓库！乡里为这个问题已经开了几次会，到现在还没有妥善解决，有些社还在愁着小麦没地方存放呢。
    儿童拾麦赛老虎
    “鞋磨烂，腰累弯，不让一穗留在田”。这是长葛县共同第三农业社儿童拾麦队的决心和誓言。共同社的儿童拾麦队共有一百二十多人。他们和成年人一样，在麦收期间，每天鸡一叫，就下地，提着篮子，一边拾麦穗，一边唱着歌，一个个好像小老虎。大人割一块，他们就拾一块，割一亩，拾一亩，哪里有麦穗就到哪里去突击。有一次，几十个小队员到后双庙生产队的田里去拾麦，受到这个队社员的阻拦，他们就编了一首快板唱道：后双庙，真是糟，麦子撒了一大片，叫你拾，你不拾，人家去拾你发急，真是厚脸皮。后双庙的社员听了，当场作了检讨，并保证提高割麦的质量。这支儿童拾麦队，在五天里，就拾了五千多斤。
    最后一个单干户要求入社
    孟县梧桐农业社的大片麦田里，一块好似一块，麦高四尺，穗长三寸，一眼望不到边，据估计最低也能亩产八百斤，奇怪的是在这大片麦田中间，夹着一小块稀拉拉的矮麦子，穗小秆细，穗子不过寸把长，麦秆只有二尺来高，据估计亩产顶多不过两百斤。党支部书记党修国告诉记者，这块麦田给他们添了不少麻烦，春季，全县评比参观消灭三类麦苗的时候，因为这块三类麦总是消灭不了，好几次给插了黄旗。原来这块麦子是单干户党修忠的。他自己有一头牲口和一辆水车，还有两个劳动力，自以为满可以比过合作社。社里搞熏肥时，他一家人又脱坯又围窑，忙碌了一阵子，社里麦子上肥三万斤，他才上了七千斤；合作社麦田浇了七次水，他两个劳动力推水车，一人改畦口，费了很大劲才浇了三次水；他既不相信密植，又不补苗，总是抱着老种麦的办法不放，结果他的麦子不像样，给全村的人丢了脸，合作社曾出人帮助改造三类麦，但因为基础太差，还是没长好。这样，他这个全村的最后单干户，终于服输了。现在，他正式向社务委员会申请，要求入社，社里已经批准他入社了。
    全省农民们在丰收的日子里，无不喜形于色，他们情不自禁地高歌：
    总路线万丈光芒，
    咱们村庄大变样，
    金黄麦子仓仓满，
    幸福日子乐无疆，
    感谢毛主席，
    感谢共产党！
