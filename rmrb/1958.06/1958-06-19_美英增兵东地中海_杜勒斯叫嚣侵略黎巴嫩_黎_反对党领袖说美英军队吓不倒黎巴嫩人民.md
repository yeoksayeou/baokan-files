Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United States and Britain are accelerating their deployment of armed intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference on the 17th, once again blatantly stated that the U.S. Sixth Fleet is watching the situation in Lebanon; some of its forces are close to the situation; and some of the newly dispatched forces under the name of "rotation" can take action in response to appropriate requests when needed.

Dulles reiterated his interest in using so-called United Nations forces to intervene in Lebanon. He also openly stated that the United States is prepared to send troops to participate. At the same time, Dulles also stated that the United States will not only intervene in Lebanon under the banner of the United Nations; under other circumstances, the United States may also send troops to Lebanon.

On the same day, Dulles also discussed the matter for two hours with military leaders, including Secretary of Defense McElroy, Undersecretary Caris, and the Chiefs of Staff. The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote on the 17th, "Today, the question of sending Western armed forces to Lebanon is being urgently studied again." According to the newspaper, two battalions of U.S. Marines in the Eastern Mediterranean are already "in a state of combat readiness," and a third battalion will depart for the Eastern Mediterranean region along with a special fleet consisting of five warships. Britain's military preparations on the island of Cyprus are also being stepped up. According to an announcement by the British Air Force Ministry, the task of airlifting a parachute brigade of approximately three to four thousand people to Cyprus is nearing completion, with the last batch of personnel having taken off on the 17th. On the same day, the British War Office announced that it would airlift another artillery regiment to Cyprus on the 18th.

Meanwhile, eight U.S. transport planes delivered a batch of U.S. ammunition to the Chamoun government on the evening of the 16th.

As the conspiracy of the United States and Britain to carry out armed intervention under the name of the United Nations becomes increasingly obvious, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjold flew to Beirut on the evening of the 17th to arrange for the "observation" work of the United Nations Observer Group. At a press conference held before his departure, he avoided answering questions raised by reporters about the possibility of foreign intervention in Lebanon and whether it was legal, only vaguely referring reporters to the United Nations Charter.

On the Chamoun government side, Health Minister Moucharafieh, who is responsible for liaison with the United Nations Observer Group, announced on the 17th that the Chamoun government has requested the United Nations to send a so-called United Nations force of several thousand people to Lebanon. According to United Press International, citing a senior official of the Chamoun government, if the United Nations cannot fulfill this "request," the Chamoun government will request U.S. and British troops to quickly move into Lebanon.

In addition, the French government has also formally expressed its intention to intervene in the armed intervention in Lebanon. French government spokesman André Malraux told reporters after a cabinet meeting on the 17th, "If Britain and the United States take action, France's attitude would probably be to participate." Malraux also revealed that a French warship is currently in Lebanese waters.

Abdul Majid Rifai, leader of the Arab Ba'ath Party in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, said in a statement on the 17th that any Western interference in Lebanon's internal affairs will only lead to the elimination of Western forces in Lebanon. Rifai said that the movements of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and British troops cannot intimidate the Lebanese people who are fighting.

    美英增兵东地中海
    杜勒斯叫嚣侵略黎巴嫩
    黎—反对党领袖说美英军队吓不倒黎巴嫩人民
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美英武装干涉黎巴嫩内政的部署正在加速进行中。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在17日举行的记者招待会上再一次露骨地表示，美国第六舰队正在注视着黎巴嫩的局势；它的一些部队是接近这种局势的；而且最近在“轮换”的名义下新调去的一些部队需要的时候可以响应适当的要求采取行动。
    杜勒斯再次表示对利用所谓联合国部队干涉黎巴嫩感到兴趣。他还公开表示美国准备派军队参加。同时，杜勒斯又表示，美国也不仅仅要在联合国招牌下才能干涉黎巴嫩，在其他一些情况下，美国也可能派军队到黎巴嫩去。
    同一天，杜勒斯还同国防部长麦克耳罗伊副部长卡利斯和三军参谋长等军事首脑商谈了两小时。“纽约先驱论坛报”17日写道，“今天又在紧急地研究把西方武装部队派往黎巴嫩的问题”。据这家报纸说，美国在东地中海的两营海军陆战队已经“处在战斗准备状态中”，第三个营将和由五艘军舰组成的一支特别舰队一起出发去东地中海地区。英国在塞浦路斯岛的军事准备工作也在加紧进行。据英国空军部宣布，空运一个伞兵旅约三千到四千人到塞浦路斯的工作已经接近完成，最后一批人17日已经起飞。同一天，英国陆军部又宣布18日将再空运一个炮兵团到塞浦路斯。
    同时，八架美国运输机16日晚把一批美国弹药运交夏蒙政府。
    在美英利用联合国名义进行武装干涉的阴谋日益明显的时候，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德17日晚乘飞机前往贝鲁特，去安排联合国观察委员会的“观察”工作的进行。在他动身前举行的记者招待会上，他对记者提出的在黎巴嫩进行外国干涉的可能性如何以及是否合法等问题避不回答，只是含糊地要记者参看联合国宪章。
    而在夏蒙政府方面，负责同联合国观察委员会之间的联络工作的卫生部长穆希贝尔17日已经宣布，夏蒙政府已经向联合国提出要求派遣一支为数几千人的所谓联合国部队到黎巴嫩来的请求。据合众国际社援引夏蒙政府一位高级官员的话说，如果联合国不能满足这一“请求”，夏蒙政府将要求美英部队迅速进驻黎巴嫩。
    此外，法国政府也正式表示要插足对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。法国政府发言人安德烈·马尔罗17日在内阁举行了会议以后对记者说，“如果英美两国采取行动的话，法国的态度大概是参加进去”。马尔罗还透露，一艘法国军舰目前正在黎巴嫩海面。
    黎巴嫩第二大城市的黎波里的阿拉伯复兴党领袖阿卜杜勒·马吉德·里法伊17日发表谈话说，西方对黎巴嫩内政的任何干涉，只会导致在黎巴嫩的西方势力的消灭。里法伊说，美国第六舰队的调动和英国的军队吓不倒正在进行斗争的黎巴嫩人民。
