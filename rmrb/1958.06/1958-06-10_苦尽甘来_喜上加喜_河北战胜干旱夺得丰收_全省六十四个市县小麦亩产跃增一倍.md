　　This dispatch from Tianjin, June 9th: After more than 200 days of fighting drought, Hebei province's more than 40 million mu of summer crops are being reaped amidst an atmosphere of celebrating the harvest. In the earlier season areas of Handan and Xingtai prefectures, statistics as of June 9th show that over 3 million mu have already been harvested. Some wheat in the central regions has also begun to be reaped.

　　"Persist in firing the first shot of the Great Leap Forward," this aspiration that the farmers of Hebei made in the spring has now been realized. According to reliable predictive statistics from already harvested wheat and agricultural technicians and experienced farmers, large-scale high-yield wheat production with yields of 500, 800, and over 1,000 jin per mu in Hebei province is no longer an isolated phenomenon. These days, in the main wheat-producing areas such as the Fuyang River, Hutuo River, and Wei Canal River basins, gongs and drums are sounding everywhere, and good news is spreading. Representatives from many agricultural cooperatives, holding up specimens of high-yield wheat and carrying reports of yields of 500, 800, and 1,000 jin per mu, are rushing to the prefectural and county leadership organs to report the good news. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office received more than 230 reporting units on June 4th alone. The leadership organs of Xingtai Prefecture have also been receiving dozens of reports of good news every day recently.

　　In the face of a severe drought with no substantial rain for more than 200 days, after the autumn sowing last year, the farmers of Hebei province successively launched five upsurges of winter irrigation, spring watering, topdressing fertilizer, and eliminating the three categories of wheat, with general wheat fields reaching five waterings and three fertilizations or seven waterings and five fertilizations. After hard work, most of the third-category wheat fields in the province were eliminated; in Shijiazhuang Prefecture alone, more than one million mu of third-category wheat was upgraded to first-category wheat.

　　The summer harvest work in Hebei province is being carried out in the context of the widespread development of the technical revolution. In order to meet the needs of this year's wheat harvest, Handan, Xingtai, and other prefectures mobilized agricultural workers and skilled craftsmen to create and modify summer harvesting tools well before the wheat harvest. Ren County in Xingtai Prefecture had already produced more than 600 horse-drawn harvesters and 71 threshing machines before the wheat harvest, realizing the requirements for semi-mechanization of wheat harvesting and greatly improving work efficiency. The county has harvested nearly half of its wheat in two days. According to the county party committee's estimate, the time for harvesting and threshing wheat throughout the county will be shortened from about 40 days in the past to five or six days. Due to the adoption of new harvesting tools, the summer harvest time in Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other places will be reduced by half compared with the past. Therefore, all localities can free up more labor and time for the field management and manure accumulation of autumn crops, creating conditions for an even greater harvest in the autumn and increased wheat production next year.

　　"Double harvest of wheat and ideology" is the outstanding feature of this year's summer harvest work in Hebei. Mutual visits have become a high tide throughout the province. According to statistics from Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other four prefectures, more than 300,000 people and rural commune cadres have visited each other. Anguo County, where the average wheat yield per mu is over 400 jin, has received more than 40,000 visitors. Many visitors in various places counted the ears and grains and calculated the yield of the 40 mu of high-yield wheat in the Jiaozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Gaocheng County, and the output was 1,127 jin per mu. Many people said: "In this way, half a mu of land can support one person." Some people said: "The hat of low wheat yield was put on it by people, and now people have taken it off."

　　This dispatch from Tianjin, June 9th: From May 27th to June 4th, Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province used methods such as a bumper harvest reporting meeting, inspection, comparison, and visits to vigorously summarize the achievements and experiences of this year's wheat harvest, and took advantage of the heat to arrange next year's wheat planting plan. In the last two days, it has been harvesting wheat intensely, and it is expected that the harvest will be roughly completed around the 12th. On the 6th, the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, on behalf of the entire district, reported good news to the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee. The letter of good news stated that the estimated wheat yield per mu in the entire district can reach 200 jin, and the total output can reach 1.1 billion jin, a double increase compared with last year. The wheat output of seven counties, including Jize, Cixian, Shexian, Yongnian, Chengan, Handan, and Linzhang, has doubled compared with last year. Jize County took the lead in doubling and doubling again. The total summer output of Chengan, Jize, Cixian, and Handan counties this year exceeded the total annual output last year. Chengan exceeded 25.75%, Jize exceeded 20.31%, Cixian exceeded 12.34%, and Handan exceeded 4.01%. What is particularly gratifying is that there are about 80,000 mu of thousand-jin mu in the entire district, and there have also been many typical examples of high-yield thousand-jin she and thousand-jin teams.

　　After receiving the letter of good news from Handan Prefecture, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee immediately issued a circular, pointing out that, like the Handan area, the entire province, with the soaring energy of the entire party and the entire people, has carried out a heroic and tenacious struggle against the severe drought, applying large amounts of fertilizer, promoting improved varieties, and implementing close planting. The summer harvest is a certainty. According to preliminary estimates from various places, 135 cities and counties can increase production compared with last year, and 64 cities and counties will increase production by more than double. The average yield per mu of Anguo, Gaocheng, Zhengding, and Shijiazhuang can reach 400 jin. Large-scale, high-yield typical examples are everywhere, which is a great joy for the people of the entire province. The circular pointed out that in order to encourage the broad masses to leap forward again and again, and to produce high yields again and again, it is hoped that all localities will deeply discover, summarize, and promote high-yield experiences, mobilize villages, communes, and teams to strive for the top, report bumper harvests, and spread the red flag of summer harvest throughout the province.

　　The circular finally proposed that, in order to strive for a greater harvest and a greater leap forward in next year's summer crops, and to create a large-scale high yield of 500, 800, and 1,000 jin, and to cultivate higher and more high-yield new records, it is hoped that all localities, in the high tide of vigorously promoting the general line, and in the giant wave of harvest and leap forward, will launch a Great Leap Forward movement of "Wheat Season Crossing the Yellow River," "Wheat Season Crossing the Yangtze River," "One Season Leaping One Year," "Double," and "Double Again," based on the spirit of continuous revolution. Starting from this year's summer harvest, vigorously engage in water conservancy, manure accumulation, and deep plowing, laying the foundation for a greater leap forward and a greater harvest next summer.

　　苦尽甘来　喜上加喜  河北战胜干旱夺得丰收
    全省六十四个市县小麦亩产跃增一倍
    本报天津9日电　经过二百多天的抗旱斗争，河北省四千多万亩夏收作物在一片庆祝丰收的气氛中开镰收割。季节较早的邯郸、邢台等专区，9日统计已收割三百余万亩。中部地区部分小麦也已开镰。
    “坚持打响大跃进的第一炮”，河北农民在春天立下的这个志愿现在实现了。根据已经收割的小麦和农业技术人员、老农的可靠预测统计，河北省小麦亩产五百斤、八百斤和千斤以上的大面积高额丰产已不是个别的。这些天来，在滏阳河、滹沱河、卫运河流域等主要产麦区，到处锣鼓喧天，喜讯四传。很多农业社的代表，高举着丰产小麦的标本，带着亩产五百斤、八百斤、一千斤的报喜单赶到专县领导机关报喜。中共邯郸地委和邯郸专署仅在4日这一天就接待了二百三十多个报喜的单位。邢台专区领导机关近来每天也接到几十起喜报。
    在二百多天没有下透雨的严重干旱情况下，河北省农民在去年抗旱播种以后，又相继掀起了冬灌、春浇、追肥、消灭三类麦等五次高潮，一般麦田都达到了五水三肥或七水五肥。经过大干苦干，全省的大部三类麦田消灭了，仅石家庄专区就有百余万亩三类麦上升为一类麦。
    河北省的夏收工作是在技术革命普遍开展的情况下进行的。为了适应今年小麦丰收的需要，邯郸、邢台等专区早在麦收以前就发动农工巧匠创造改制夏收工具。邢台专区的任县在收麦前已赶制了马拉收割机六百多台，脱粒机七十一台，实现了收麦半机械化的要求，大大提高了工作效率。这个县在两天内已收割近半数的小麦。据县委估计，全县小麦收打时间将由过去的四十天左右缩短到五六天完成。由于采用了新式收割工具，邯郸、石家庄等地的夏收时间均将比过去缩短一半。因此各地都能腾出更多的劳力和时间进行大秋作物田间管理和积肥，为秋季的更大丰收和明年小麦增产创造条件。
    “小麦、思想双丰收”是河北今年夏收工作的突出特点。互相参观已在全省形成高潮。据保定、石家庄等四个专区统计，互相参观的群众和乡社干部达三十余万人。小麦平均亩产四百斤以上的安国县，已接待了四万多参观者。很多地方的参观者把藁城县焦庄农业社的四十亩高额丰产麦计穗、数粒，合计产量，每亩打一千一百二十七斤。许多人说：这一来有半亩地就能养活一个人了。有的人说：“小麦低产的帽子是人们给它戴上的，现在人们给它摘下来了。”
    本报天津9日电　河北省邯郸专区在5月27日至6月4日，用丰收报喜会、检查、评比、参观等方法，大张旗鼓地总结了今年小麦丰收的成绩和经验，趁热布置了明年小麦种植计划。近两天来，正在紧张收割小麦，预计12日前后即可大体上收割完毕。中共邯郸地委、邯郸专署于6日代表全区向中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会报喜。报喜书中说，全区小麦预计亩产可达二百斤，总产量可达十一亿斤，比去年增产一倍。鸡泽、磁县、涉县、永年、成安、邯郸、临漳等七个县的小麦产量同去年相比都翻了一倍，鸡泽县一马当先一翻再翻，成安、鸡泽、磁县、邯郸四个县今年夏季的总产量超过了去年全年的总产量。成安超过25.75％，鸡泽超过20.31％，磁县超过12.34％，邯郸超过4.01％。特别值得庆幸的是：全区出现约八万亩左右千斤亩，并且还出现了不少的千斤社、千斤队的高额丰产典型。
    中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会接到邯郸专区的报喜书后，立即发出通报，指出：全省和邯郸地区一样，经过全党全民冲天的干劲，鏖战苦战地向严重干旱进行了英勇顽强的斗争，大量施肥、推广良种和实行密植，夏季丰收已成定局。据各地初步估产，有一百三十五个市、县可比去年增产，其中增产一倍以上的就有六十四个市、县，安国、藁城、正定、石家庄市平均亩产可达四百斤。大面积的、高额的丰产典型到处都有，这是全省人民的大喜事。通报中指出，为了鼓舞广大群众，跃进再跃进，高产再高产，希望各地深入发现、总结、推广丰产经验，发动乡乡、社社、队队争上游、报丰产，把夏季丰收的红旗插遍全省。
    通报最后提出：为了争取明年夏季作物的更大丰收更大跃进，并创造五百斤、八百斤、一千斤的大面积丰产和培养更高更多的高额丰产新纪录，希望各地在大张旗鼓地宣传总路线的高潮中，在丰收、跃进的巨浪中，根据不断革命的精神，发动群众开展“麦季过黄河”“麦季跨长江”“一季跃一年”“翻一翻”“翻两翻”的大跃进运动。从今年夏收开始，大搞水利、积肥、深翻地等工作，打下明年夏季更大跃进、更大丰收的基础。（附图片）
