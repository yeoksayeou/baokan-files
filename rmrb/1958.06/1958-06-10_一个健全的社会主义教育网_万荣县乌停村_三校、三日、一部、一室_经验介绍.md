　　A Sound Socialist Education Network
　　——Introducing the Experience of "Three Schools, Three Days, One Club, One Room" in Wuting Village, Wanrong County
　　By Our Reporter　Feng Jianwei
    In Shanxi, there is a village whose political and ideological outlook has undergone a 180-degree change in two years. This village is Wuting Village in Wanrong County. In 1956, this village "lost its soul." Commune members did not pay attention to quality in their work and did not cherish the property of the cooperative. Eighty-three strong and fat oxen died in succession, and more than 130 farm tools, large and small, were damaged. Of the 385 households in the village, more than 200 were short of grain and demanded supplies. More than 60 people were not engaged in proper work, some carrying used clothes to Lanzhou, and some selling rabbits to other counties. Production in the village declined, and cultural and health work was also backward. In 1957, the evil trends and unhealthy influences disappeared, the lost "soul" was found, and people turned from the wrong path to the right path. Not only were no oxen injured or killed, but a group of calves were added. Damage to farm tools was greatly reduced, those engaged in speculative business gave up, and those not engaged in proper work mended their ways. Production in the village flourished, and cultural and health work also took the lead in the county.
    Why did such a drastic change occur in two years? The story is like this:
    Finding the Lost Political Soul
    As early as the spring of 1957, the Wuting Village Branch of the Communist Party of China received a profound education from the successive deaths of oxen and the damage to farm tools, and experienced the truth that ideological and political work must not be relaxed at any time. At that time, the branch had carried out some work through civil schools or mass meetings, but capitalist ideology always occupied a dominant position, unable to be broken or shattered! In the face of complex and arduous ideological struggles, the Party branch decided to start with rectifying and improving the organization and carrying out comprehensive and systematic education to further strengthen ideological and political work. Therefore, it learned from the experience of An'yi County in establishing night party schools, and established a night party school, stipulating that classes would be held every tenth day of the month to educate party members on party knowledge, policies, and tasks. Subsequently, the Youth League organization also followed the example of the party school and established a League school to systematically educate League members and youth activists. The original political education in the civil school was also rectified and improved, becoming a peasant spare-time political school with formal courses and classes. Over the past year, the party school has systematically taught the Party Constitution, socialist revolution, socialist construction, and Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, enabling party members to clarify the ideas of "the revolution has reached its end, the revolution has no end, and the revolution has reached one's own head," and improve their work enthusiasm. The education on the League Constitution, communist morality, and labor attitude carried out by the League school has also changed many League members who looked down on labor and were not content with rural work. The education on the relationship between the individual and the collective, the road to socialist construction, running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and running the household diligently and thriftily, carried out by the civil school, has begun to improve the state of disunity in the whole village. However, it was also found at that time that the "three schools" could only carry out positive and systematic education, with poor connection to reality and insufficient resolution of specific problems. If education could be combined with the actual life of party members, League members, and peasants, it would play a greater role. This wish was finally fulfilled not long after the establishment of the Party Day, League Day, and "Three Loves and Three Diligences Day" system. This "three days" system takes the Party Constitution, the League Constitution, and the "Three Loves and Three Diligences Convention" as the criterion, the spirit of criticism and self-criticism as the method of activity, carries out mass mutual criticism and supervision, achieves the goal of improving thinking, improving work style, and solving specific problems in daily life from the perspective of ideological understanding, with good results. In order to further improve the propaganda and mobilization work on the basis of improving political and ideological education, following the establishment of "three schools and three days," a club and an exhibition room were also established and improved. These two organizations used various forms of propaganda, such as physical exhibitions, clapper talks, dramas, singing, dancing, reading newspapers, reading books, blackboards, and broadcasting, to cooperate with the central work and carry out extensive propaganda activities. In this way, it not only achieved the goal of encouraging the fighting spirit of cadres and masses and promoting current production, but also combined with "three schools and three days" to launch a comprehensive attack on the remnants of capitalist ideology. For a time, what the people of the whole village thought, did, said, sang, listened to, and watched, anytime, anywhere, at all times, was nothing but socialism.
    The "three schools, three days, one club, one room" organization is a huge driving force for the development of political and ideological work in Wuting Village. The role of this organization makes political and ideological education more precise and systematic than before, and also enables ideological education to be closely linked to actual life, effectively improving people's ideological awareness and promoting production and construction. In the past, the party members and cadres of Wuting Village had a vague understanding of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, and there had long been two erroneous tendencies: one was to fear contradictions, avoid struggles, and adopt a passive and retreating attitude. For example, party member Li Tianhai resigned as the director of the cooperative after only sixty days because he was afraid of commune members causing trouble over grain. The other was to treat people and handle affairs by coercive means regardless of the distinction between the enemy and ourselves. For example, party cadre Wei Minglun relied on orders to do everything, without persuasion or education. Although these two tendencies had been criticized in the party in the past, because the issues were discussed in isolation and ideological understanding was not improved, the changes were very small. After the establishment of the party school, it systematically explained the manifestations, nature, causes, and correct handling methods of contradictions among the people, aiming at ideological problems, making everyone's closed minds suddenly enlightened, and consciously examining problems and criticizing mistakes. Li Tianhai and other four party members who were originally passive and retreating immediately became active. Wei Minglun, who had committed the error of coercion and command, also changed his leadership style and was elected by the commune members as a cadre in charge of sideline production. It was with this teaching method combining theory with practice, positive education with life criticism, that the "three heads" thinking of some party members, the lack of peace of mind of League members in rural production, and the erroneous thinking of commune members' dependence on the state and the cooperative were completely eliminated.
    One Rope Pulls Eight Lines
    Another excellent role of "three schools, three days, one club, one room" is that under the unified leadership of the Party organization, they can interlock, cooperate in combat, and conduct propaganda and education work in a concentrated manner. As early as when it was just established and first showed its edge, it carried out a joint and unified propaganda and education activity aimed at the phenomenon that some commune members arbitrarily damaged farm tools and livestock and were not actively working in the commune. At that time, the "three schools" focused on explaining the principles of "loving the commune as one's home" and the unity of individual and collective interests in terms of principles, so as to improve the ideological understanding of the commune members. The "three days" focused on the damage to farm tools and the death of livestock, and launched a mass debate. On the basis of improving understanding and distinguishing right from wrong, the commune members Wei Bianze and Li Baihuai, who had consistently damaged farm tools and abused livestock, were severely criticized. Commune members Yan Chunzhang and Yan Wuyin, who loved public property and worked actively, were commended. The club promptly compiled 22 clapper talks such as "The Cattle Complain" and "Livestock is the Treasure of Farmers," and performed them in the streets and alleys. The exhibition room also used real people and objects to hold an exhibition of dead livestock and damaged farm tools, using charts, cartoons, and objects to tell people the causes and harms of farm tool damage and cattle death. In the past, many commune members were indifferent to the commune's property, thinking that "if the official drum is broken, everyone will mend it, and it's not worth a penny when it's one's turn"! After seeing the specific calculations in the exhibition, they realized that the more than 80 dead cattle were worth more than 14,000 yuan, and each commune member's household lost an average of nearly 20 yuan, and they realized the consistency of individual and collective interests, and they put forward rationalization proposals one after another, demanding to strengthen the responsibility system and improve the feeding and service system. From then on, the phenomenon of livestock weakness, death, and farm tool damage quickly stopped.
    In carrying out education on the grain issue, "three schools, three days, one club, one room" also adopted the method of studying the ideological situation of commune members in advance, grasping the typical ideological tendency of "eating more grain is a matter of personal life and has nothing to do with the state," and concentrating efforts to criticize it. The "three schools" put forward that the issue of saving or not saving grain is essentially a question of whether to take the socialist road or not. It raised the issue of grain to the height of the road of social development. The "three days" launched a comparative debate through the facts of Chen Rongzhi's saving grain and Wei Fugui, Wei Yinzhu, and Li Shengyao's wasting grain, so that everyone further clarified the harm of wasting grain to the state, the cooperative, and the individual. The club also used various living people and events to carry out ideological education, such as Wei Fugui, who had forgotten his roots and took the lead in causing trouble over grain. The club organized the elderly to recount his painful life of losing his parents in his childhood and being a cowherd for the landlord, enduring hunger and starvation, to inspire him to recall and compare, so that Wei Fugui woke up from his dream and tearfully examined his mistakes. The exhibition room used physical exhibitions and on-site visits to promote Chen Rongzhi's experience in saving grain, so that everyone learned the method of making coarse grains fine and using substitutes. A new trend of obeying the state's supply and marketing plan was quickly formed in the whole village. Although this year everyone ate an average of 65 kilograms less grain than in 1956, no one shouted that they were short of grain.
　　Tortuous Road, Rich Fruits
    It is difficult to create experience, and it is not easy to adhere to experience for a long time. In the process of creating "three schools, three days, one club, one room" in Wuting Village, many twists and turns occurred. At the beginning of the establishment, the "three schools" lacked teachers, and no one lectured when there were classes. Later, classes were reluctantly started, but people were not always present. Either this one was called away to attend a meeting, or that one was pulled away to work, and many farmers were not used to it, often arriving late and leaving early, with vacant seats. The Party branch clearly understood that the most fundamental reason for this bleak situation was that the party members and cadres had not straightened out their thinking and had not paid attention to it. Therefore, it was decided to discuss in the party the issues of "is it okay not to do political and ideological work?" and "what is learning for?" At the same time, the painful lessons of burying oneself in production and neglecting politics in 1956, which resulted in reduced grain production, reduced income, damaged farm tools, and dead livestock, were used to educate party members and cadres. The whole party quickly reached a consensus, and everyone expressed their determination to overcome difficulties and do a good job in political and ideological work. Since then, branch committee members have been assigned to lead the "three schools" and serve as teachers, organize teaching and research groups, regularly collect and study the ideological situation of party members, collectively prepare lessons, take turns lecturing, and promptly solve specific problems, so that the party school gradually got on the right track. The difficulty of lacking talents was solved quickly by adopting the method of supplementing what was lacking, giving equal importance to politics and business, and selecting and training from among the cadres sent to the countryside, demobilized soldiers, and junior high school graduates. In addition, a strict teaching system was formulated and learning and working time were arranged uniformly, solving the contradiction between learning and production. In this way, "three schools, three days, one club, one room" have been adhered to, and the villagers have developed the habit of learning and have never been interrupted.
    Recently, Wuting Village held a grand exhibition to review the achievements of creating "three schools, three days, one club, one room" in the past year, and invited more than 400 representatives attending the propaganda work conference convened by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee to visit the site and exchange and summarize experience. The exhibits, charts, and cartoons were dazzling and filled two courtyards and a large room. Countless exhibits proved the fresh flowers and rich fruits of "three schools, three days, one club, one room" in Wuting Village. The most prominent gain here is the change in people's spiritual outlook. According to the statistics of the Wuting Village Branch of the Communist Party of China, in the past year, the number of first-class party members in the village increased from six to fourteen, the number of second-class general party members decreased from four to two, and the original five backward party members have all been transformed into good party members. The political and ideological situation of the broad masses of peasants is also completely different from what it was a year ago. First-class commune members account for 94% of the total number of commune members, and only a few unreformed landlords and rich peasant elements are backward. Wuting Village is located in a dry and high plateau with poor natural conditions, but the production of the whole village has gradually developed and people's lives have gradually improved. This year, we have had a bumper harvest of wheat and six major new features have emerged, such as basically eliminating illiteracy and basically eliminating the "four pests," which have renewed the old, dirty, and dilapidated appearance of Wuting Village. The tall walls are painted snow-white, with colorful murals and art slogans everywhere. The streets are cleaned every day, and earth-made garbage bins are set up. There are sidewalks on both sides of the wide roads, and rows of small cypress trees have grown. The whole village is like a large garden with fragrant fragrance, and a new atmosphere is everywhere.

　　一个健全的社会主义教育网
　　——万荣县乌停村“三校、三日、一部、一室”经验介绍
　　本报记者　冯建伟
    山西有一个村庄，两年之间，政治思想面貌发生一百八十度的大变化，这个村就是万荣县的乌停村。1956年，这个村“丢了灵魂”。社员作活不讲质量，不爱惜合作社财物。膘壮肥大的黄牛一连死了八十三条，大小农具坏了一百三十多件。全村三百八十五户，有二百多户吵闹缺粮，要求供应。有六十多人不务正业，有的背估衣下兰州，有的贩兔子跑外县；村里生产衰落，文化和卫生工作也很落后。1957年，歪风邪气烟消云散，丢掉的“灵魂”找来了，人们由歧路转向正道。大黄牛不但没有死伤，还添了一群小牛犊，农具损坏大大减少，搞投机生意的人洗手不干了，不务正业的改邪归正，村里的生产蒸蒸日上，文化卫生工作也在全县遥遥领先。
    为什么在两年之间竟然会发生这样急剧的变化呢？事情原来是这样的：
    找回丢掉的政治灵魂
    还在1957年的春天，中共乌停村支部就从连二接三的死牛、坏农具事件中受到深刻教育，体验到任何时期都不能放松思想工作和政治工作的真理。当时，支部曾通过民校或群众大会，进行了一些工作，但是资本主义思想始终占居统治地位，冲不动，打不烂！在复杂艰巨的思想斗争面前，党支部决定从整顿健全组织，开展全面系统的教育入手，来进一步加强思想工作和政治工作。于是，便学习安邑县创办夜间党校的经验，建立一座夜间党校，规定每月逢十上课，向党员进行有关党的知识、政策和任务的教育。接着，团组织也仿照党校的样子，建立了团校，向团员和青年积极分子进行系统教育。原来的民校政治教育，也经过整顿健全，变成有正式课程、班次的农民业余政治学校。一年来，党校系统地教学了党章、社会主义革命、社会主义建设和毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，使党员清理了“三头”（革命到了头、革命没有头、革命革到自己头”思想，提高了工作积极性。团校进行的团章、共产主义道德和劳动态度的教育，也使许多轻视劳动，不安心农村工作的团员得到改变。民校进行的个人和集体关系、社会主义建设道路、勤俭办社和勤俭持家教育，使全村的涣散状况，开始有了好转。但是，当时也发现“三校”只能进行正面的系统的教育，联系实际较差，解决具体问题不够。如果使教育结合党员、团员和农民的实际生活，那就会发挥更大的作用。这个愿望终于在不久建立起党日、团日和“三爱三勤日”制度后，完满实现。这种“三日”制度，是以党章、团章和“三爱三勤公约”为准则，以批评和自我批评精神为活动方法，开展群众性的互相批评监督，达到提高思想，改善作风，从思想认识的角度，解决日常生活中的具体问题，效果很好。为了在政治思想教育提高的基础上，进一步作好宣传鼓动工作，继“三校、三日”建立之后，又建立和健全了俱乐部和展览室，这两种组织通过实物展览和快板、戏剧、歌咏、舞蹈、读报、读书、黑板、广播等多种宣传形式，配合中心工作，开展广泛的宣传活动。这样，不仅达到鼓励干群斗志，推动当前生产，而且和“三校、三日”结合起来，向资本主义思想残余展开全面冲击，一时，全村人们想的，干的，说的，唱的，听的，看的，随时随地，无时无刻，无一不是社会主义。
    “三校、三日、一部、一室”的组织，对于乌停村政治思想工作的开展是巨大的推动力量。这种组织的作用使政治思想教育比从前更精确更系统，而且还能使思想教育紧密联系实际生活，有效的提高人们思想觉悟，推动生产建设。乌停村党员干部原来对如何正确处理人民内部矛盾认识很模糊，长期以来就存在两种错误倾向：一种是害怕矛盾，躲避斗争，采取消极退缩的态度。如党员李天海当了六十天合作社主任，害怕社员闹粮，辞职不干了。一种是不分敌我界线，一律用强迫手段待人处事。如党员干部尉明伦干什么也靠命令，不说服教育。对于这两种倾向，过去在党内虽然都作过批评，但因为就事论事，思想认识提不高，而转变很小。党校建立后，便针对思想问题，系统地讲解有关人民内部矛盾的表现形式、矛盾性质、发生根源和正确处理方法，使大家闭塞的思想豁然开朗，自觉地检查问题，批判错误。原来消极退缩的李天海等四个党员，立刻积极起来。犯强迫命令错误的尉明伦，也转变了领导作风，被社员选为领导副业生产的干部。就是用这种理论联系实际、正面教育和生活批判相结合的教学方法，使某些党员的“三头”思想，团员的不安心农村生产，社员的依赖国家和合作社等等错误思想，都得到彻底清除。
    一条绳牵起八条线
    “三校、三日、一部、一室”的另一优异作用，是能够在党组织的统一领导下，环环相扣，联合作战，集中地进行宣传教育工作。还在它刚刚建立，初试锋芒的时候，就针对当时某些社员任意损坏农具、牲畜，不积极在社内劳动的现象，进行一次联合统一的宣传教育活动。当时，“三校”着重从道理上讲“爱社如家”和个人与集体利害一致的道理，提高社员们的思想认识。“三日”便以农具损坏、牲畜死亡为中心内容，开展群众性的大辩论。在提高认识分清是非的基础上，对一贯损坏农具和虐待牲畜的社员尉边则、李百槐等人，进行了严厉批判。对爱护公共财物、积极劳动的社员阎春章、阎武寅等作了表扬。俱乐部及时编写“黄牛诉苦”和“牲畜就是庄户宝”等二十二个快板，在街头巷尾演唱。展览室还利用真人实物，举办死牲畜和坏农具的展览会，用图表、漫画、实物，告诉人们农具损坏、耕牛死亡的原因和害处，原来不少社员对社内财物漠不关心，认为“官鼓坏了众人补，轮到自己头上不值几文”！看了展览会上的具体计算，才知道死的八十多头牛，价值一万四千多元，每户社员平均损失近二十元，体会到个人利益和集体利益的一致性，纷纷提合理化建议，要求加强责任制，改善饲养和使役制度，从此牲畜瘦弱、死亡和农具损坏现象，便迅速停止。
    在进行粮食问题的教育上，“三校、三日、一部、一室”，也是采取事前研究社员思想情况，抓住“多吃粮食是个人生活问题，与国家无关”这个典型的思想倾向，集中力量进行批判。“三校”提出节约不节约粮食的问题，实质上是走不走社会主义道路的问题。把粮食问题提到社会发展道路的高度来认识。“三日”通过节约用粮的陈荣智和浪费粮食的尉富贵、尉印珠、李胜耀等人的事实，掀起对比大辩论，使大家进一步明确浪费粮食对国家、合作社和个人的危害。俱乐部又通过各种活人活事作思想教育，如对翻身忘本带头闹粮的尉富贵，俱乐部就组织老年人陈述他幼年丧失父母给地主放牛忍饥挨饿的痛苦生活，启发他回忆对比，使尉富贵从迷梦中醒悟过来，痛哭流涕的检查错误。展览室则用实物展览和现场参观的办法，推广陈荣智节约用粮的经验，使大家学会粗粮细作、采用代食品的办法。全村很快形成一种服从国家供销计划的新风气。这一年虽然比1956年每人平均少吃了六十五斤粮食，从没有一个人叫喊缺粮的。
　　曲折的道路丰富的果实
    创造经验困难，长期坚持经验也不容易。乌停村在创建“三校、三日、一部、一室”的过程中，就曾发生过许多波折。创办之初，“三校”缺教员，有课没人讲。后来勉强开了课，人又到不齐。不是这个被叫走开会，就是那个被拉去工作，还有许多农民不习惯，经常迟到早退，缺额虚席；对于这种不景气的状况，党支部清楚地了解，最根本的原因是党员干部思想上没有搞通，没有引起重视。因此，便决定在党内讨论“不作政治思想工作行不行？”“学习是为了什么？”等问题，同时，又以1956年埋头生产、忽视政治，结果造成粮食减产、收入降低、农具损坏、牲畜死亡的惨痛教训，教育党员干部，全党认识很快取得一致，大家都表示要克服困难，决心搞好政治思想工作。此后，支部委员分工领导“三校”，兼任教员，组织教研组，定期收集和研究党员思想情况，集体备课，轮流讲课，及时解决具体问题，使党校逐渐走向正轨。对于缺乏人材的困难，采取缺啥补啥、政治和业务并重的办法，由下放干部、复员军人、初中毕业学生中选择和培养，迅速解决。另外，还严格制订教学制度，统一安排学习和工作时间，解决了学习和生产的矛盾。这样，“三校、三日、一部、一室”便坚持了下来，村里人都养成学习习惯，永没有间断过。
    最近，乌停村举行一次盛大展览会，检阅一年来创建“三校、三日、一部、一室”的成就，邀请出席山西省委召开的宣传工作会议的四百多代表实地参观，交流总结经验。展出的实物、图表、漫画，琳琅满目，摆满了两个院子和一个大房间。无数件展品证明，乌停村“三校、三日、一部、一室”的鲜花硕果。这里最突出的收获是人们精神面貌的变化。据中共乌停村支部统计，全村党员在一年之间，一类党员由六人增加到十四人，二类一般党员由四人减为二人，原来五个落后党员，已经全部转变为好党员，广大农民的政治思想状况，也与一年前迥然不同，一类社员已占社员总数的94％，只有少数未改造好的地主富农分子，才表现落后。乌停村地处干旱高垣，自然条件很差，但是，全村生产逐渐发展，人们的生活逐渐改善。今年喜逢小麦大丰收，又出现基本扫除文盲，基本消灭“四害”等六大新气象，使旧日肮脏破烂的乌停村街头面貌焕然一新。高大的墙壁粉刷的雪白，到处有色彩鲜艳的壁画和美术标语。街道每天打扫清洁，还设置土造垃圾箱，宽敞的马路两旁有了走水道，长起成行的小柏树。整个村里像一座香郁四射的大花园，到处呈现新生气象。
