Not a Grain Left Behind: Collecting Wheat for the Commune

　　This newspaper reports that members of the Guangming Second Cooperative in Sujia Township, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, recently, under the leadership of the cooperative's management committee, through extensive airing of views, fully expressing opinions, and debates on the issue of collecting wheat for the cooperative, put forward the slogan "Return every grain to the cooperative," aiming to increase grain yield by five catties per mu.

　　After the establishment of this cooperative in 1956, many members here, like members of other cooperatives, believed that since cooperativization had occurred, everything belonged to "the cooperative." In order to gain more grain for themselves, some female members neglected production within the cooperative and led their children in groups to randomly collect wheat in the cooperative's fields. Some openly collected, while others secretly stole. The impact of collecting wheat not only disrupted the order of the summer harvest, but more seriously, many women did not participate in the cooperative's labor, preventing the full utilization of labor power. At the same time, because family members of the cooperative members collected wheat for themselves, they quarreled with each other, affecting the solidarity of cooperative cadres and even among teams.

　　Based on the above situation, the cooperative management committee recently raised questions such as "Is it right to randomly collect wheat?" "Is it better for the collected wheat to belong to the cooperative or to individuals?" "How should wheat be collected this year?" and organized cooperative cadres and members to conduct airing of views, expressing opinions, and debates. During the debate, members discussed the issues one after another, and some recognized the disadvantages of privately collecting wheat. Guo Jucheng said: Labor belongs to everyone, but the collected wheat becomes private. Reduced production affects the cooperative, and less grain handed over affects the state. In the end, the cooperative, the state, and everyone suffer! The superiority of the agricultural cooperative is completely wiped out. Female members Su Xiuying and Caicaima said: Some young and strong women do not participate in the cooperative's farm work, but instead randomly collect and steal wheat everywhere, sometimes even fighting and making a mess, causing disunity among cooperative cadres and members. This selfish and self-serving thinking must be eliminated this year. Some, although recognizing that randomly collecting wheat is bad, still could not accept the idea of collecting wheat for the cooperative. For example, Qiankunma said: To have the collected wheat returned to the cooperative, isn't that governing people too strictly? As soon as she said this, Chen Guiying immediately retorted, saying that in order to return every grain to the collective, everyone has a responsibility to return the collected wheat to the cooperative. What's so "strict" about that? At this time, some members raised different opinions, such as saying that wheat collected in one's own cooperative's fields should belong to the cooperative, while wheat collected in other cooperatives' fields should belong to the individual. Chen Jianhai immediately said: No, the collection of wheat should not be divided by region. All wheat collected by cooperative members should belong to the cooperative. Cooperative members work hard under the scorching sun, and it is unreasonable for you to keep the collected wheat for yourselves. Through debate, everyone realized that it was inappropriate for collected wheat to belong to individuals and agreed that it should belong to the cooperative.

### 颗粒不遗　拾麦归社

　　颗粒不遗　拾麦归社
    本报讯　陕西咸阳县苏家乡光明二社的社员，最近在社管会的领导下通过大鸣、大放，辩论了拾麦归社的问题，提出“颗粒还社”的口号，要每亩增收粮食五斤。
    1956年这个社建立后，这里的许多社员也和其他社的社员一样，认为合作化了，一切都成了“社里的”；为了自己多得粮食，一些妇女社员，放下社里的生产不管，领上孩子成群结队地在社的地里乱拾麦。有的明拾暗偷。由于拾麦的影响，不但使夏收工作秩序混乱，严重的是很多妇女不参加社的劳动，使劳动力不能发挥应有的作用；同时，由于社员家属拾麦归自己，互相争吵，影响到社干部甚至队与队的不团结。
    根据上述情况，最近社管会提出“乱拾麦对不对？”“拾下的麦归社好？还是归个人好？”“今年怎样拾麦”等问题，组织社干、社员展开鸣、放、辩。在辩论中社员纷纷议论，有的认识到私拾麦的坏处。郭巨成说：劳动是大家的，拾下的麦是私人的，减了产是社里的，少交公粮是国家的，结果亏了社亏了国家还亏了大家！把农业社的优越性一下弄光了。女社员苏秀英和彩彩妈说：有些年轻力壮的妇女，不参加社的农活，却到处乱拾麦、偷麦，有时甚至打闹得乱哄哄的，闹的社干、社员都不团结，这种自私自利的思想今年一定要去掉。有人虽然认识到乱拾麦不好，但对拾麦归社还通不过。如乾坤妈说：要把拾下的麦归社，那不是把人治的太死了吗？他的话刚一出口，陈桂英立即反驳说，为了颗粒还家，大家把拾的麦子归社，这是大家的责任，还有什么“死”的呢？这时，有的社员又提出了不同意见。如说：在本社地里拾麦归社，在外社地拾的麦应当归个人。陈建海立即说：不行，拾麦不应分地区，凡是社员拾的麦都应该归社，社员都在热死黄天的日子里辛苦劳动，你们把拾的麦子归自己，这是不合理的。经过辩论，大家都认识到拾麦归私人不妥当，同意归社。
