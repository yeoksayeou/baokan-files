The NPC Standing Committee Approves Agricultural Tax Regulations
　　Stabilize the Burden on Farmers, Promote Agricultural Development
　　During the Second Five-Year Plan, the annual agricultural tax collection will be basically stabilized at the level of the 1958 collection. By 1962, the proportion of agricultural tax to actual output will decrease from about 11.3% in 1957 to about 7%.
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its ninety-sixth meeting this afternoon to discuss and approve the Agricultural Tax Regulations of the People's Republic of China.
    Before discussing and approving this regulation, the meeting heard an explanation given by Vice Minister of Finance Wu Bo. Wu Bo said that after the basic completion of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, the relations of production in rural areas have undergone fundamental changes. The original method of agricultural tax collection based on individual economy is no longer applicable. Since 1956, the Ministry of Finance has begun drafting new agricultural tax regulations. Over the past two years, it has solicited opinions from provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and various departments of the Central Government, and has held several professional meetings for discussion and revision, and has been discussed and approved by the 71st plenary meeting of the State Council on February 12, 1958.
    Wu Bo said that the new Agricultural Tax Regulations (draft) are based on the principles of benefiting the development of agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, taking into account the interests of the state, collectives, and individuals, taking into account the combination of unified leadership and adapting to local conditions, and simplifying the tax system as much as possible. According to these principles, on the one hand, starting from the rural economic situation after agricultural cooperation, some important changes have been made to the original agricultural tax system; on the other hand, past experiences have been summarized, and some of the original collection methods that have proven effective and are still applicable in the future have been retained.
    Wu Bo said that in 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, agricultural output will increase greatly, but the agricultural tax in 1958 will only increase by 4.6% compared with 1957. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the annual agricultural tax collection will basically be stabilized at the level of the 1958 collection and will not be increased. He said that by 1962, China's agricultural production will increase by at least 60% compared with 1957. Since the amount of agricultural tax collected remains basically unchanged, the proportion of agricultural tax to actual output will gradually decrease from about 11.3% in 1957 to about 7% in 1962. This means that the agricultural production increase during the Second Five-Year Plan will be basically used to increase the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives and the income of farmers, which is of great significance for encouraging farmers to accelerate the socialist construction of rural areas in accordance with the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Under the condition of continuous increase in agricultural production, adopting a stable policy for the burden on farmers can only be achieved in the new China where the working class holds power.
    After discussion, the meeting also passed a resolution approving the Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    The meeting then heard a report by Deputy Secretary-General Zhang Su on the adjustment of the electoral units and number of representatives of the Second National People's Congress.
    Finally, the meeting approved the list of appointments and removals. This included the appointment of Zhou Xing as Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. Zhou Xing previously served as Deputy Minister of Public Security.

    人大常委会通过农业税条例
　　稳定农民负担  促进农业发展
　　第二个五年计划期间，各年的农业税征收额，基本上稳定在1958年征收额的水平上。到1962年农业税占实际产量的比例，将由1957年的11.3％降到7％左右。
    新华社3日讯  全国人民代表大会常务委员会在今天下午举行第九十六次会议，讨论和通过了中华人民共和国农业税条例。
    会议在讨论和通过这个条例以前，听取了财政部副部长吴波所作的说明。吴波说，全国农业合作化基本完成以后，农村的生产关系起了根本的变化。原来以个体经济为基础的农业税征收办法，已经不再适用。从1956年起，财政部就开始起草新的农业税条例。两年来曾先后向各省、自治区、直辖市和中央各部门征求了意见，并且多次召开专业会议进行了讨论和修改，并且经过1958年2月12日国务院全体会议第七十一次会议讨论通过。
    吴波说，新的农业税条例（草案）是本着有利于农业生产的发展和农业生产合作社的巩固，兼顾国家、集体和个人利益，照顾统一领导同因地制宜相结合，并且尽量简化征税制度等原则来拟定的。根据这些原则，一方面从农业合作化以后的农村经济情况出发，对原来的农业税收制度作了若干重要的改变；另一方面总结了过去的经验，把原来征收办法中行之有效而且今后仍然适用的一些规定都保留下来。
    吴波说，1958年，由于农业生产的大跃进，农业产量将有很大的增长，但1958年的农业税只比1957年增加4.6％。第二个五年计划期间，各年的农业税征收额，即基本上稳定在1958年征收额的水平上，不予提高。他说，到1962年，我国农业生产至少将比1957年增长60％以上，由于农业税征收额基本不变，农业税占实际产量的比例将由1957年的11.3％，逐渐下降到1962年的7％左右。这就是说，在第二个五年计划期间的农业增产部分，将要基本上用来增加农业生产合作社的公共积累和农民的收入，这对于鼓励农民根据鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，加速农村的社会主义建设，是有很大作用的。在农业生产不断增加的情况下，对农民负担采取稳定的方针，这只有在工人阶级掌握政权的新中国才能做到。
    会议经过讨论，还通过决议，批准中华人民共和国政府和蒙古人民共和国政府文化合作协定。
    会议接着听取了副秘书长张苏关于第二届全国人民代表大会代表的选举单位和代表名额调整情况的报告。
    会议最后通过了任免名单。其中包括任命周兴为最高人民检察院副检察长，周兴曾任公安部副部长。
