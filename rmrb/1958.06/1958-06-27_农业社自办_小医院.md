　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. A number of health clinics established by agricultural cooperatives are being set up in the suburbs of Shanghai and in the counties of Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai. A township hospital with twenty beds, run by Donggou Township in the East Suburbs District, will open on July 1st.

　　These health clinics, which farmers call "small hospitals," are all located within the agricultural cooperatives. The medical and healthcare personnel are cadres seconded from medical units who take time out from labor to serve, and some are doctors from nearby township joint clinics. These medical and healthcare personnel also frequently make house calls for treatment. In the five agricultural cooperatives in Xuhang Township, Jiading County, 54% of the patients in the health clinics were treated by doctors making house calls in four months.

　　The health clinics charge low fees, generally only two jiao per visit. Those who temporarily lack money for medical treatment and medicine can have it recorded and deducted when the autumn distribution takes place.

　　The agricultural cooperatives spend very little money running the health clinics, only needing to purchase some commonly used medicines. The medical and healthcare personnel are supplied by the cooperative through fixed salaries or payment in work points. The health clinics are generally able to break even.

    农业社自办“小医院”
    新华社上海26日电　由农业社创办的一批保健室，正在上海郊区和嘉定、宝山、上海三县建立。东郊区东沟乡举办的一个设有二十张病床的乡医院，将在7月1日开幕。
    这些保健室，农民称它为“小医院”，都设在农业社里。医务保健人员是由医疗单位的下放干部从劳动中抽出一部分时间来担任的，有些是附近乡镇联合诊所的医生。这些医务保健人员还经常出诊上门治疗。嘉定县徐行乡五个农业社举办的保健室，四个月中有54％的病人是医生上门治疗的。
    保健室收费便宜，一般每次看病只花二角钱，一时缺少钱就医买药的，可以记账，到秋后分配时扣还。
    农业社举办的保健室花钱很少，只需购置一些常用药品。医务保健人员的供给，由社里定薪或用工分支付。保健室一般都能保本自给。
