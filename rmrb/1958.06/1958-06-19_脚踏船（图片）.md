    Pedal Boat
    The shipyard in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, has successfully created a pedal boat. This boat is equipped with two foot-pedaled wheels. One person pedals to steer, making it light, convenient, and labor-saving, and even faster than rowing with two oars. Its carrying capacity reaches 800 to 1,000 catties, making it suitable for inland waterway transportation. (Xinhua News Agency)
