Powerful Czechoslovak Industry

According to per capita calculations, Czechoslovakia ranks first or second in the world in the production of ten items. It ranks first in the world for electric washing machines, motorcycles, and shoes, and second for machine tools, rolling mill equipment, freight car carriages, coal, and wool fabrics.

Taking a few of the most important industrial products for comparison, according to 1957 statistics, Czechoslovakia's per capita steel production was 386 kilograms, 66 kilograms more than France, 110 kilograms more than Canada, 46 kilograms more than Sweden, 85 kilograms more than Australia, and more than three times that of Italy. Czechoslovakia's per capita pig iron production was 269 kilograms, 73 kilograms more than Sweden, 48 kilograms more than Australia, about four times that of Japan, and more than six times that of Italy. Czechoslovakia's per capita coal production was 5.6 tons, about one ton more than West Germany, 1.1 tons more than the United Kingdom, and 3.3 times more than France. In terms of per capita cement production, Czechoslovakia was at 270 kilograms, exceeding the United Kingdom by 34 kilograms and approaching the level of the United States. In terms of electricity, Czechoslovakia's per capita consumption was 1,360 kilowatt-hours, significantly exceeding France and Italy, and reaching the level of the world's most advanced countries.

The strong vitality of Czechoslovak industry is also reflected in its development speed far exceeding that of developed capitalist countries. Taking the machine-building industry as an example, if the production index of the machine-building industry in various countries in 1950 is 100, then in 1956, Czechoslovakia was 269, while the United States was only 149, the United Kingdom 129, Belgium 147, and Sweden 120. In addition, calculated on a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia's production of chemical industrial equipment has surpassed the United States and reached the level of West Germany; in terms of metallurgical equipment, it has surpassed West Germany. In terms of power equipment production, Czechoslovakia has also surpassed the United Kingdom and is approaching the level of the United States and West Germany. (Yang)

    强大的捷克斯洛伐克工业
    按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克有十种物品的生产分别列居世界第一位和第二位。占世界第一位的有电气洗衣机、摩托车和鞋子，占第二位的有机器工具、轧钢设备、货车车厢、煤和毛织品等。
    试拿几种最重要的工业产品来比较一下，根据1957年的统计，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均的钢产量是三百八十六公斤，比法国多六十六公斤，比加拿大多一百一十公斤，比瑞典多四十六公斤，比澳大利亚多八十五公斤，相当于意大利的三倍多。捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均的生铁产量是二百六十九公斤，比瑞典多七十三公斤，比澳大利亚多四十八公斤，约等于日本的四倍和意大利的六倍多。捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均的煤产量是五·六吨，约比西德多一吨，比英国多一·一吨，比法国多三·三倍。按人口平均的水泥产量，捷克斯洛伐克是二百七十公斤，已超出英国三十四公斤，而接近于美国的水平。在电力方面，按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克是一千三百六十度，大大超过法国和意大利，达到了世界上最先进国家的水平。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业的强大生命力也表现在它的发展速度远远超过发达的资本主义国家。以机器制造业为例，如果各国1950年机械制造业产量的指标为一百，则1956年，捷克斯洛伐克为二百六十九，而美国仅是一百四十九，英国一百二十九，比利时一百四十七，瑞典一百二十。此外，如按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克化学工业设备的生产已追过美国，达到了西德的水平；冶金设备方面超过了西德。动力设备的生产，捷克斯洛伐克也超出了英国，接近美国和西德的水平。  （杨）
