If It Doesn't Rain, Demand Water from the Earth
Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Calls for Completion of Transplanting Plan Around the Summer Solstice

(Our dispatch) The people of all nationalities in Yunnan Province are fighting tenaciously and persistently against the most severe drought in history with the heroic spirit of "forcing the heavens to surrender."

Since last winter, most areas of Yunnan Province have been experiencing drought for as long as seven months. As a result, small rivers and streams have almost completely dried up, and the drought is widespread and severe, unprecedented in Yunnan's history.

However, in the face of the continuously rising revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the broad masses throughout the province, the threat of this drought has become a driving force for breaking the old idea of "relying on the heavens for food." Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Yunnan are determined to declare war on nature with doubled measures and a hundredfold effort. "Full planting and transplanting with no rain in June, a good harvest even with no rain in July" has become the rallying cry of the masses' arduous struggle.

Currently, a production upsurge centered on drought-resistant planting and drought-resistant seedling protection is in full swing. The labor attendance rate in rural areas in each county has reached 100%. As a result of putting politics in command, an unprecedented political situation has emerged in the countryside. Extensive debates and big-character posters have penetrated the fields, and the masses are full of fighting spirit. Miraculous feats are emerging everywhere. In Haining County, District Four organized more than 500 waterwheels to draw water from Fuxian Lake over the mountains, a distance of twenty kilometers, for drought-resistant planting. A method of large-scale collaboration, embodying the spirit of communism and breaking down the boundaries between townships and communes, has been widely adopted by the masses in the fight against drought.

In addition to conserving water and building water conservancy projects, "demanding water from the earth" is a characteristic of this year's drought resistance efforts in Yunnan. In the past, the people of all nationalities in Yunnan rarely dug wells, but after careful water accounting and mass debates this spring, more than one million wells and ponds have now been dug, and more than ten thousand man-made dragon pools have been created throughout the province.

Although the drought is severe this year, thanks to the persistent and active hard work of cadres and the masses, the progress of rice transplanting has been nearly half faster than the same period last year just after the Grain Buds season. More than 41% of the province's transplanting plan has been completed, and it is advancing at a rate of 400,000 mu per day. After studying the rural production situation on the 6th, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that it is necessary to persist in hard work, firmly believe in the long-term drought resistance effort, and strive to complete the entire planting plan around the summer solstice to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest. The Provincial Committee pointed out that it is necessary to pay attention to the emergence of new skeptics and resolutely fight against them. The struggle against the drought this year should be regarded as a test to train cadres and the masses, raise awareness, and accumulate experience. It is necessary to overcome the drought, achieve victory, turn bad things into good things, and make all the bandwagoners and skeptics feel ashamed in the autumn. (Wang Dian)

### 天不下雨向地要水  云南省委号召在夏至前后完成栽插计划

    天不下雨向地要水
    云南省委号召在夏至前后完成栽插计划
    本报讯　云南各族人民正以“要老天爷举手投降”的豪迈气概，与历史上最严重的一次干旱作着顽强持久的战斗。
    去冬以来，云南省绝大部分地区干旱已达七个月之久。因而目前小河流水几已全部枯竭，旱象普遍严重，为云南历史上所罕见。
    但是，这种干旱的威胁，在全省干部和广大群众革命干劲继续高涨的形势面前，却成为了打破“靠天吃饭”的陈旧观念的一种推动力量。云南人民正在党的领导之下决心以加倍的措施和百倍的干劲向自然宣战，“6月无雨要满栽满插，7月无雨也要丰收”已成为群众的苦战口号。
    目前以抗旱栽种、抗旱保苗为中心的生产高潮正气势磅礴，农村的劳动出勤率各县都达100％。政治挂帅的结果，已使农村出现了前所未见的政治局面，大辩论、大字报已深入田间，群众斗志旺盛。处处涌现奇迹般的壮举。华宁县四区组织五百多台水车，越过高山抽抚仙湖水经过二十公里抗旱栽种。一种表现共产主义精神的、打破乡、社界限的大协作的方法，已在抗旱斗争中被群众广泛采用。
    除了节约用水与兴修水利，“向地下要水”是今年云南抗旱中的一个特色。云南各族人民已往少有打井的习惯，但在今春细算水账，群众性的大辩论以后，目前全省已打井打塘一百万个以上，人造龙潭一万多处。
    今年虽然旱象严重，但由于干部和群众持久的积极苦战，芒种刚过，水稻栽秧的进度已快于去年同期一半左右，全省已完成栽秧计划的41％以上，连日正以每天四十万亩的速度前进。中共云南省委6日在研究了农村生产情况以后指出：必须坚持苦战，坚定持久抗旱的信心，力争在夏至前后全部完成栽种计划，为丰收奠定基础。省委指出：必需注意新的怀疑派出现，并要和他们作坚决斗争，要把今年与旱象的斗争，作为锻炼干部和群众，提高觉悟、积累经验的一种考验，必需战胜干旱，取得胜利，变坏事为好事，使一切观潮派、怀疑派在秋后无地自容。　（王甸）
