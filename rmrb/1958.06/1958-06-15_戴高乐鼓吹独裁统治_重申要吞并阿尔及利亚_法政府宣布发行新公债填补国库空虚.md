Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Paris Dispatch: De Gaulle delivered a ten-minute speech to the French public on French television on the evening of the 13th, touting his implementation of dictatorial rule in France and reiterating his stubborn colonialist stance of annexing Algeria.

When discussing the "major problems" facing France, De Gaulle first proposed to "pacify Algeria." Completely disregarding the Algerian people's repeated declarations of their firm desire for national independence, he stated that "actions must be taken to unite Algeria with France forever."

De Gaulle admitted that he came to power in a situation where fascists and colonial soldiers created riots in Algeria and staged armed coups in France itself. He said: "The task of myself and my government is to propose a new system to our people," to give the government "sufficiently effective power." He described the establishment of a government with absolute power as a "precondition" for everything. In this regard, he spoke strongly about the "referendum" on the "new system" scheduled for this autumn.

On domestic issues, De Gaulle focused on France's economic difficulties, stating that "extremely difficult but absolutely necessary efforts" must be made to "restore order to public finances and the economy." He said that otherwise, France would face a major catastrophe. He vigorously encouraged the French people to buy more government bonds to "ensure" the "victory" of government measures.

Regarding foreign relations, De Gaulle emphasized that France "belongs" to the Western bloc, but at the same time, he said that France does not "confine" itself within this bloc. He said that France will "occupy its proper place and carry out its due activities" in this bloc in order to "serve both the nation and security at the same time."

De Gaulle also advocated that France form a "federation" with its African colonies and establish ties with Morocco, Tunisia, and Indochina "on the basis of cooperation."

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Paris Dispatch: The De Gaulle government has decided to issue a new government bond starting June 17th in order to further squeeze the people's blood and sweat to fill the empty treasury. The term of the new government bond is as long as fifty-four years. The total amount of issuance has not been disclosed. The decision was announced by Finance Minister Pinay at a press conference on the evening of the 13th.

It is reported that due to the endless consumption of the Algerian colonial war, France's financial situation is very embarrassing. The $655 million in foreign debt borrowed from the United States and the West European "Payment Union" at the beginning of this year is about to be used up, and by the end of May, France still owed nearly $400 million to the West European "Payment Union."

    戴高乐鼓吹独裁统治
    重申要吞并阿尔及利亚
    法政府宣布发行新公债填补国库空虚
    新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：戴高乐13日晚上在法国电视节目中向法国公众发表了十分钟的演说，替他在法国实行独裁统治进行鼓吹，并且重申要吞并阿尔及利亚的顽固的殖民主义立场。
    戴高乐在谈到法国所面临的“重大问题”时首先提出要“平定阿尔及利亚”。他完全不顾阿尔及利亚人民一再表明的坚决争取民族独立的愿望，表示要“采取行动使阿尔及利亚永远同法国结成一体”。
    戴高乐承认，他自己是在法西斯分子和殖民军人在阿尔及利亚制造暴乱以及在法国本土制造武装政变的形势下上台的。他说：“我和我的政府的任务就是向我国人民提出新制度”，要使政府有“足够有效的权力”。他把建立一个独揽大权的政府说成是一切事情的“前提条件”。在这方面，他强烈地谈到预定在今年秋天就“新制度”问题举行的“全民投票”。
    在内政问题方面，戴高乐集中地谈论了法国的经济困难，表示必须进行“非常困难但又绝对必要的努力”来“恢复财政经济的秩序”。他说，否则的话，法国将会有大灾祸临头。他竭力鼓动法国人多多购买政府即将发行的公债，来“保证”政府措施获得“胜利”。
    在谈到对外关系时，戴高乐强调法国是“属于”西方集团的，但是同时他又说，法国并不把自己“局限”在这个集团之内。他说，法国将在这个集团中“占据它应有的位置和进行理应属于它的活动”，以便“同时为国家和安全两者服务”。
    戴高乐还主张法国同它在非洲的属地组成“联邦”，以及同摩洛哥、突尼斯和印度支那各国“在合作的基础上”建立联系。
    据新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：戴高乐政府决定从6月17日开始发行一项新公债，以便进一步压榨人民的血汗，来填充空虚的国库。新公债的期限长达五十四年。发行总额没有透露。这个决定是由财政部长比内在13日晚间的记者招待会上宣布的。
    据报道，由于阿尔及利亚殖民战争的无尽止的消耗，法国的财政境况十分窘迫。今年初向美国和西欧“支付同盟”借得的六亿五千五百万美元的外债就要用完了，而到5月底为止，法国还在西欧“支付同盟”欠下了近四亿美元的债务。
