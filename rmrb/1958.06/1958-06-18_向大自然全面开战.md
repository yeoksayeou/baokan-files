Launch a Full-Scale War Against Nature
Zhang Zicun, Secretary of the CPC Wushan County Committee

Without Conquering Drought, We Cannot Escape Poverty

Our Wushan County, like everywhere else, is in the spring of the Great Leap Forward. We are launching a full-scale war against nature with the task of fundamentally transforming the natural landscape within two years, basically eliminating factors unfavorable to the development of production.

The task of transforming the natural landscape in Wushan County was proposed after the completion of agricultural cooperativization. The natural environment forced us to take this path. Wushan County is located on the Loess Plateau in the upper reaches of the Wei River in central Gansu. 95% of the area is mountains, hills, and ravines. The annual rainfall is between 300 and 500 millimeters, mostly concentrated in the autumn, and droughts occur constantly. In a major drought in 1928, more than 10,000 people starved to death in the county. In Mahe Township, with more than 500 households, 1,000 people starved to death. At the time of liberation, out of 790,000 mu of land in the county, 630,000 mu were frequently affected by disasters, with a yield of only 90 jin per mu. The total grain output was only 72 million jin, an average of about 250 jin per person. Obviously, without conquering drought, the people cannot escape poverty, and there is no point in talking about building socialism.

Thus, the task before us is to rapidly change the natural landscape and eliminate drought. Initially, everyone lacked confidence. After the realization of advanced cooperativization, we felt that we could victoriously complete this task. However, there were still many obstacles, especially ideological obstacles. Due to the backwardness of rural culture and the long-term suffering of farmers from drought, there were superstitious ideas in their minds, believing that humans could not conquer nature. In 1953, when the county suffered a severe drought, many farmers worshiped gods to pray for rain and even beat the cadres who advised them to build water conservancy projects. The county party committee studied this situation and believed that in order to change the natural landscape, it was necessary to liberate the masses' minds, and to liberate the masses' minds, it was necessary to present facts to the masses to show them that changing the natural landscape was possible. In order to mobilize the masses, we focused on cultivating typical examples. In 1953, although some cadres were beaten, the county party committee still organized these people and mobilized activists to build a small canal to draw water up the mountain in Zhu Jia Ping. That year, those who prayed for rain had poor harvests, while those who built water canals had good harvests. Although the canal in Zhu Jia Ping was small, it sparked the fire of revolution against nature, educated the masses, and launched the first water conservancy construction movement in Wushan County. Since then, we have cultivated various typical examples throughout the county. Each typical example was largely managed personally by the secretary or member of the county party committee, from cultivation to the creation of experience, to consolidation and improvement, taking full responsibility from beginning to end, allowing these typical examples to grow and strengthen, and not allowing these typical examples to collapse midway. Soon, various banners appeared throughout the county: Deng Jia Bao and Guan Er Cun for soil and water conservation, Zhu Jia Ping and Dong Liang Qu for drawing water up the mountain, Ma He Township and Kui Ge She for afforestation, Deng Jia Bao and Mou Jia Ping for leveling land, and He Ping Township and Dong Shun She for realizing water conservancy. We organized the masses to visit various points on the one hand and organized people from the points to publicize in other villages on the other. This method of education from the masses to the masses, this method of influencing and promoting work from points to areas, achieved remarkable results. Through the efforts of the people of the county, by 1957, there were 160,000 mu of irrigated land (including 50,000 mu before liberation), 800,000 mu of afforestation, the land on the mountains had been terraced, and soil erosion was basically controlled. In that year, the county's grain output increased from 72 million jin to 140 million jin, and the average grain per person increased from 250 jin to 700 jin. The material life of the people of the county has been greatly improved, greatly increasing their confidence in overcoming nature.

The Three Measures to Change the Natural Landscape

After the launch of the mass rectification movement and the victory in the anti-rightist struggle last autumn, leading cadres and the broad masses alike raised their socialist consciousness and boosted their revolutionary drive, immediately creating a situation of a great leap forward in socialist construction throughout the county. In particular, the provincial party committee conveyed the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, saying that Chairman Mao called on the country to work hard for three years to fundamentally change the appearance of various regions and catch up with Britain in fifteen years, which gave us great inspiration and made us realize that socialist construction should be faster and faster, not slower. We examined and criticized the right-leaning conservative ideas in the leadership's thinking and immediately organized a great leap forward in socialist undertakings throughout the county. We put forward the slogan of "fundamentally transforming in one year and completely transforming in two years" in fundamentally transforming the natural landscape. We thought that with the revolutionary drive of the leadership and the masses, with the guarantee of agricultural cooperativization, with the foundation of past work, and with many banners for transforming nature, this is strength. We are determined to "leap to the sky in one step" in the work of transforming the natural landscape according to the law of "water and soil are connected, and grass and trees grow together," so that the work of transforming nature will advance by leaps and bounds, completely reversing the passive situation of people in the face of nature, ensuring that what we obtain from nature is no longer disasters, worries, and anxieties, but endless wealth and joy, so that nature will make amends in front of people, awaiting dispatch. Therefore, we mobilized the people of the county to launch a war against nature and began three major thorough transformations of the natural landscape.

The first thorough transformation is to turn all dry land into paddy fields and eliminate drought. To this end, we launched the Dong Liang Qu—that is, the water-up-the-mountain movement, and thousands of canals appeared to draw water up the mountain. During the busy construction in winter, the attendance rate of the county's 190,000 agricultural population reached 80%, and the regular attendance rate was 60%. The elderly, women, and children all went to the mountains. Everyone's slogan is: "If the water doesn't go up the mountain, the people don't come down the mountain, the ground freezes three feet, the heart is ten feet hot, not afraid of difficulties, conquer drought." So far, 320,000 mu of irrigated land have been built. Now, we are rushing to build the 250-li-long Middle Liang Qu and the 800-li-long North Liang Qu (built jointly with Gangu County). These two canals will be completed during winter irrigation and can irrigate 250,000 mu of land. By this winter, all 790,000 mu of land in the county, except for 60,000 mu of shady and humid areas, will be turned into irrigated land, and this task was originally planned to be completed in five years.

As a result of drawing a large amount of water up the mountain, we now feel that the water source is insufficient, and the flow of water in the canals is not large, especially during the dry season. The long-term solution to this problem is, of course, to plant trees and forests to change the climate and conserve water sources. However, distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. At present, while repairing canals, the county has launched the "hundred reservoirs, thousand ponds, ten thousand cellars" movement. Our slogan is: "A thousand ponds as positions, a hundred reservoirs as backing, ten thousand cellars as vanguards, green ridges and wastelands as guards, close rainwater when it rains, store canal water when there is no rain." In this way, water can be accumulated during the dry season, and water can be stored during the rainy season. Even if it does not rain for a hundred days, long-term irrigation can be guaranteed.

The second thorough transformation is to turn bald mountains into green mountains, so that the barren yellow mountain tops, ridges, and all places that can be planted with trees and grass will turn into a lush green color, changing the climate and beautifying the environment. The total area of ​​Wushan County is more than 2.7 million mu. In addition to 790,000 mu of cultivated land and 440,000 mu of pastoral land, there are still 1.5 million mu of land that need to be afforested, of which 800,000 mu are suitable for large-scale afforestation, and 700,000 mu of ridges and wastelands need to be interplanted. In the past few years, we have adopted a three-guarantee system in afforestation work, namely: guarantee planting, guarantee management, and guarantee survival. From the cooperative to each household and each person, they are contracted to a certain area and number. By last year, the county had completed 800,000 mu of large-scale afforestation, of which 300,000 mu had become closed forests. The remaining 700,000 mu of afforestation tasks were originally planned to be completed in ten years, and 400,000 mu were completed in 1958. However, as a result of this year's concentrated greening, 410,000 mu were completed in seven days, and now it has exceeded the plan by 110,000 mu, and it is planned to plant another 200,000 mu by the end of the year. The result is "a ten-year plan completed in one year, and a one-year plan completed in seven days." According to last year's experience, due to the implementation of the three-guarantee system, the survival rate of trees is above 90%. Now, newly planted trees are growing everywhere in Wushan, and there are also 390,000 mu of grass in the middle of these trees. The beautiful scenery of large trees and dense forests in Wushan County is just around the corner. In order to beautify the environment of the county, we have also put forward the slogan of "fourizations"—orchardization, vegetable gardenization, melon gardenization, and gardenization—and are working hard to realize this wish.

The third thorough transformation is to turn sloping fields into flat fields and small plots into large plots, that is, to transform the terrain on existing cultivated land to make it conducive to production. Wushan County has 350,000 mu of cultivated land with a slope of about 10 degrees, 200,000 mu with a slope of 15 to 20 degrees, and 30,000 mu with a slope of about 30 degrees. These lands are divided into many small plots by more than 50,000 gullies that are hundreds of meters long, four or five meters wide, and three or four meters deep, and by hundreds of thousands of ridges and roads. This situation is extremely unfavorable to production. After the water goes up the mountain, it increases the difficulty of irrigation, lengthens the project of branch canals, and still cannot eradicate the erosion of the land by water during the irrigation process. Precisely because the plots are too small, it wastes labor during cultivation and is not suitable for machine farming and other technological reforms. Therefore, we launched a "flattening slopes and connecting land" movement throughout the county. Our action slogan is: "Split mountains to fill gullies, compete with ridges for land, merge canals and roads, connect land, borrow soil to return to life." The reason for proposing "borrowing soil to return to life" is because some land has exposed red sand and rocks, which cannot grow crops. These things must be blasted and transported away, and new soil must be filled in so that it is the same as other land, so as not to affect the work of connecting the land because it is sandwiched between two good pieces of land. We have already created some experience in this area. For example, in the past, it took 60 to 70 workdays to level one mu of land with a slope of 15 degrees in Baiquan Township. Later, the "multi-headed plow, soil-pulling board, and quick flat land method" was created, which only takes six workdays per mu. According to this experience, the township has leveled more than 50,000 mu. Because some land has a large slope, and because some large gullies separate many pieces of land, blasting must be used to improve work speed. To this end, we have consciously trained more than 10,000 peasant blasting experts and established three small explosives factories while repairing the mountain canals. We plan to complete 250,000 mu of land leveling and connection work this year and 300,000 mu next year. In this way, the terrain will be greatly transformed, so that all the terraced fields are flat, and all the land is transformed from small pieces to large pieces, which is conducive to production, technological reform, and management.

The Victorious Fruits of Marching Toward Nature

Through the above work, that is to say, by next year, Wushan will completely complete the work of transforming the natural landscape. We will no longer spend a lot of labor on transforming the natural landscape, and we will no longer worry about drought. Nature has succumbed to us, and we can free up our hands to speed up the pace of agricultural technology revolution. This work has already partially started this year. For example, in order to improve the soil, the work of deep plowing has begun, and 80,000 mu of land have been plowed, and all will be completed next year. In order to increase the amount of fertilizer, while carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement, bacterial fertilizer factories have been established, and another chemical fertilizer factory is under construction. This year, the county has applied 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In order to increase crop yield, the area of intercropping and interplanting has been expanded from 30,000 mu to 470,000 mu. The area of high-yield crops has been expanded from 130,000 mu to 280,000 mu. In order to improve farming efficiency, the number of new agricultural tools has increased from more than 6,000 to more than 20,000, and preparations are being made to expand the area of mechanized farming. These measures alone can certainly bring huge economic benefits to the people of Wushan. This year, the total grain output of the county will increase from 140 million jin to 360 million jin, the yield per mu will increase from 190 jin to 500 jin, and the average grain per person will increase from 700 jin to 1,900 jin. Encouraged by this situation, the people of the county put forward the fighting slogan for the future: ensure that the grain yield per mu crosses the Yangtze River in three years! The people of Wushan excitedly saw their future, and they painted a beautiful scene for this future: "Clear water flows, flowers and fruits fill the mountains, fish swim in the canals, ducks fill the ponds, the five grains are abundant, the six animals are prosperous, the electric lights shine brightly, and a beautiful paradise." Comparing this beautiful scene with the past of Wushan is like heaven and earth! This is the victorious fruit of the people of Wushan marching toward nature. Now, we are working hard to implement the general line put forward by the central government of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, preparing to launch a magnificent agricultural technology revolution, so that we can extract more wealth from nature and ensure that the yield per mu exceeds 800 jin in three years!

    向大自然全面开战
    中共武山县委书记　张子存
    不战胜干旱  不能摆脱穷困
    我们武山县，和各地一样，正处在大跃进的春天里。我们正在向大自然全面开战，任务是：保证两年内基本改造自然面貌，把不利于发展生产的因素基本清除。
    武山县改造自然面貌的任务，在农业合作化完成以后就提出了。自然境界逼得我们不能不走这条路。武山县位于甘肃中部渭河上游黄土高原上，全境95％的面积是大山、丘陵、沟壑。年雨量三百至五百公厘，大都集中在秋季落下，旱灾不断发生。1928年一次大旱全县就饿死一万余人，有五百多户人家的马河乡就饿死千人。解放当时，全县七十九万亩土地，有六十三万亩经常受灾，每亩产量只有九十斤，粮食总产量不过七千二百万斤，每人平均只有二百五十斤左右。很显然，不战胜干旱，人民无法摆脱贫困，也谈不上建设社会主义。
    这样，摆在我们面前的任务是迅速改变自然面貌，消灭旱灾。开始，大家的信心不足。实现了高级合作化以后，我们觉得可以胜利完成这个任务了。但是，障碍还是很多的，特别是思想障碍。由于农村文化落后，农民受旱灾的长期折磨，思想上存在着迷信观念，认为人无法胜天。1953年全县大旱，不少农民拜神求雨，并且打了劝他们修水利的干部。县委研究了这种情况，认为想改变自然面貌必须要解放群众的思想，而要解放群众的思想必须拿出事实给群众看，使他们知道改变自然面貌是可能的。为了发动群众，我们突出地抓紧了培养典型的工作。1953年，虽然有些干部挨了打，县委仍组织了这些人，并动员了积极分子，在朱家坪修了一条小小的引水上山的渠道。这一年，求雨的欠收，修水渠的丰收。朱家坪的渠道虽小，却发出了向大自然革命的火花，教育了群众，掀起了武山县第一个兴修水利的运动。从此，我们在全县范围内，培养了各种各样的典型。每个典型，大都由县委书记或委员亲自掌握，由培养到创造出经验，到巩固提高，从头负责到底，只许这些典型成长壮大，不许这些典型中途垮台。不久，全县出现了各种旗帜，水土保持有邓家堡和观儿村，引水上山有朱家坪和东梁渠，绿化有马河乡和魁阁社，平整土地有邓家堡和牟家坪，实现水利化有和平乡和东顺社。我们一面组织群众到各个点里参观，一面组织点里的人到外乡宣传。这种由群众中来到群众中去的教育方法，这种由点到面影响推动工作的方法，收到了显著的效果。经过全县人民的努力，到1957年已有水地十六万亩（其中有解放前的五万亩），造林八十万亩，山上的土地已梯田化，基本上控制了水土流失。这一年，全县粮食产量由七千二百万斤提高到一亿四千万斤，每人平均粮食由二百五十斤提高到七百斤。全县人民的物质生活有了很大程度的改善，大大提高了战胜大自然的信心。
    改变自然面貌的三项措施
    去年秋季展开全民性整风运动和取得反右派斗争胜利以后，从领导干部到广大群众，提高了社会主义觉悟，鼓起了革命干劲，立即在全县里出现了社会主义建设大跃进的形势。特别是省委传达了八届三中全会精神，说毛主席号召全国苦战三年基本改变各地区面貌，十五年赶上英国，这给了我们很大的启示，使我们认识到社会主义建设应该快些、再快些，而不是慢些。我们检查和批判了领导思想上的右倾保守观念，立即组织了全县社会主义事业的大跃进。我们在根本改造自然面貌方面提出了“一年基本改造，两年彻底改造”的口号。我们想，有了领导和群众的革命干劲，有了农业合作化的保证，有了过去工作基础，有了许多面改造自然的旗帜，这就是力量。我们决心根据“水土相连，草木相生”的规律在改造自然面貌的工作上“一步登天”，让改造自然的工作一日千里，完全扭转人在大自然面前被动的局面，保证我们从大自然那里取得的不再是灾害、耽心和忧虑，而是无穷的财富和欢乐，让自然在人的面前戴罪立功，听候调遣。于是，我们动员全县人民向大自然开战，对自然面貌开始了三大彻底改造。
    第一个彻底改造是：变全部旱田为水田，消灭旱灾。为此，我们开展了东梁渠——即水上山运动，出现了千条引水上山的渠道。冬天施工紧张时，全县十九万农业人口出勤率高达80％，经常出勤率60％。老人、妇女、儿童都上山了。大家的口号是：“水不上山，人不下山，地冻三尺，心热十丈，不怕艰难，战胜干旱。”到目前为止，已修水地三十二万亩。现在，正突击赶修长达二百五十华里的中梁渠、长达八百华里的北凉渠（与甘谷县合修的），这两条渠道冬灌时完成，可浇地二十五万亩。至今冬，全县七十九万亩土地除六万亩阴湿地带外，全部变成了水地，而这个任务原计划是要五年完成的。
    大量引水上山的结果，现在已感到水源不足，渠道里水的流量不大，特别是枯水时期。解决这个问题，长久的办法当然是植树造林，以改变气候，涵蓄水源。但远水不解近渴，目前，全县在修渠的同时，开展了“百库、千塘、万窖”运动。我们的口号是：“千塘作阵地，百库作后盾，万窖当先锋，绿化埂荒作卫兵，下雨关雨水，无雨蓄渠水。”这样，在枯水期可以积水，雨季可以储水，即使百日不落雨，也可保证长年灌溉。
    第二个彻底改造是：变秃山为绿山，使枯黄的山头上、地埂上和一切能够植树种草的地方都变成碧绿的颜色，改变气候，美化环境。武山全县面积是二百七十余万亩，除去七十九万亩耕地、四十四万亩畜牧地外，尚有一百五十万亩土地需要植树，其中宜于大面积造林的是八十万亩，需要间种的梗荒七十万亩。过去几年，我们在绿化工作上采取了三包制，即：包栽、包管、包活。由合作社到每户、每人，都包下一定的面积和数目。到去年，全县已完成大面积造林八十万亩，其中已有三十万亩变成了郁闭森林。剩下的七十万亩造林任务，原计划十年完成，1958年完成四十万亩。但是，经过今年突击绿化的结果，七天内完成了四十一万亩，现在已超过计划十一万亩，计划到年底再种二十万亩。结果是“十年计划一年完成，一年计划七天完成”。根据去年的经验，由于实行三包制，树的成活率都在90％以上。现在，在武山到处长起了新栽的树，在这些树的中间还有三十九万亩草。武山县树大林密的美景，已指日可待了。为了美化全县的环境，我们又提出了“四化”——果园化、菜园化、瓜园化、花园化的口号，并且在努力实现这一愿望。
    第三个彻底改造是：变坡田为平田，变小片为大片，也就是对现有耕地上的地形改造，使其有利于生产。武山县有坡度十度左右的耕地三十五万亩，十五度至二十度的二十万亩，三十度左右的三万亩。这些土地，被五万多条长数百公尺、宽四五公尺、深三四公尺的沟，被几十万条地埂和道路分割成许多小块，甚至有几分一块的。这种状况极不利于生产。水上山以后，增加了灌溉的困难，延长了支渠的工程，灌溉过程中仍然不能根绝水对土地的冲刷。正由于地块太小，耕种时浪费劳动力，不适于机器耕作及其他技术改革。因此，我们在全县范围内，展开了“削平坡度、土地连片”运动。我们行动的口号是：“劈山填沟，与埂争地，合渠并道，土地连片，借土还生。”所以提出“借土还生”是因为有些土地中间已露出红砂、岩石，不能生长庄稼，要把这些东西炸掉、运走，另填上新土，使它与其他土地一样，不致于因为它被夹在两块好地的中间而影响连片的工作。我们在这方面已创造了一些经验。如百泉乡过去平整坡度十五度的土地一亩要六十至七十个工，后来创造了“多头犁，拉土板，速成平地法”，一亩地只需六个工，该乡按照这个经验，已平整了五万多亩。由于有些土地坡度较大，由于有些大沟隔开了许多土地，必须使用炸破才能提高工作速度。为此，我们在修上山渠道时，已有意识培养了一万多名农民炸破手，建立了三个小型的炸药工厂。我们计划今年完成二十五万亩，明年完成三十万亩的土地平整和连片工作。这样，在很大程度上改造了地形，使所有的梯田都是平坦的，使所有的土地由小块变成了大块，就有利于生产、技术改革和管理了。
    向自然进军的胜利果实
    通过上述工作，也就是说到明年，武山就彻底完成了改造自然面貌的工作。我们再不会为改造自然面貌花大量的劳动力了，再不会为干旱发愁了，大自然在我们面前屈服了，我们就可以腾出手来，加快脚步进行农业技术革命。这一工作，今年已部分开始。例如：为了改良土壤，开始了深翻地的工作，已翻地八万亩，明年全部完成；为了增加施肥量，在开展积肥运动的同时，又建立了细菌肥料工厂，另一个化学肥料厂正在建设中。今年全县每亩地已施肥两万斤；为了提高作物产量，复种和套种面积由三万亩扩大到四十七万亩；高产作物面积由十三万亩扩大到二十八万亩；为了提高耕作效率，新农具已由六千多部增加到两万多部，并且准备条件扩大机耕面积。只是这些措施，已经可以肯定将在经济上给武山人民带来巨大的经济利益。今年全县粮食总产量将由一亿四千万斤提高到三亿六千万斤，亩产量由一百九十斤提高到五百斤，每人平均粮食由七百斤提高到一千九百斤。在这种情况的鼓舞下，全县人民提出了今后的战斗口号：保证在三年内粮食亩产量跨过长江！武山人民兴奋地看到了自己的未来，他们给这个未来画了一个美景：“清水长流，花果满山，鱼游渠中，鸭满塘边，五谷丰登，六畜兴旺，电灯高照，美丽乐园。”拿这个美景同武山的过去相比，正是天渊之别！这就是武山人民向大自然进军的胜利的果实。现在，我们正努力贯彻中央提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，准备掀起一个波澜壮阔的农业技术革命，这样，我们就会从大自然身上索取更多的财富，保证三年内亩产量超过八百斤！
