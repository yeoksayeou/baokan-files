Can the "Shangyou" Cooperative Leap Forward Again?
——A Debate in the Gulong Cooperative on the General Line
Tang Youguo

Speaking of the Gulong Cooperative in Luocheng, it once had a glorious history. As early as 1956, it was rated as an agricultural model cooperative in Guangxi Province; last year, it was the county's model cooperative; in late May of this year, in the county-wide major inspection and appraisal, it once again won the glorious title of "Shangyou Cooperative" awarded by the county party committee. Over the past few years, the lives of the masses have undergone fundamental changes, and poverty and backwardness have become a thing of the past. Precisely because of this, some cadres and members of the cooperative developed serious complacency. The following is a major debate in this cooperative on whether it can leap forward again after implementing the general line.

The Divergence of Two Lines

After the cooperative cadres studied the general line of socialist construction in the county, they became even more enthusiastic and decided to make another great leap forward on the existing basis, to achieve a double thousand jin per mu yield of rice by the end of the year, to adopt new-style agricultural implements, and to motorize transportation. The plan was good, but as soon as it was announced to the members, it was immediately strongly opposed by those with conservative ideas. He Qishi said: "In a mountainous area like ours, leaping forward to this point is already the limit. What 'three-izations'? It's really like 'a hungry dog wanting to eat swan meat'..." Old farmer Qin Yongzeng immediately echoed: "In my opinion, you cadres are 'going upstream' into a daze! Let's just sit steady in the fishing boat!" Many people also said: "Two meals a day is enough for us; we don't want anything else." This surprised the cooperative cadres a lot.

No Superstition Allowed

The next day (June 9th), a debate on "Can Mountainous Areas Leap Forward Again?" was launched among all the members of the cooperative. Cooperative cadre Qin Yongyue listed the facts of production comparison over three years, refuting the claim that "mountainous areas cannot leap forward." He said: "During the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, we made small efforts, and grain production increased. We sold 160,000 jin of surplus grain alone, and none of the 300 households in the cooperative bought grain from the state. In 1957, we opposed 'reckless advance,' and even 'small efforts' were opposed, resulting in a decrease of 95,000 jin, and 30% of the surplus grain households became grain-deficient households, and only 20,000 jin of surplus grain was sold. This year, we are making great efforts, and all the paddy fields have been replanted with early rice seedlings, and the planting season has been advanced by thirty days. It is the best crop in eight years, and a bumper harvest is a certainty." Cooperative member Qin Yongsheng also said: "In my opinion, it is entirely possible to realize the 'three-izations.' First of all, we have eliminated drought and realized double seedlings; secondly, most of the field foundations have been opened up, and small plots have become large plots, which can fully use new-style agricultural implements; the township road was basically completed in 1956, and only needs to be repaired, so it can fully realize motorized transportation." Speaking of this, Qin Yongsheng asked rhetorically: "Who can say that we do not have the conditions to leap forward?" "I say we don't." He Qishi shouted loudly: "First, we don't have technicians to manufacture agricultural implements; second, we don't have designers; third, we don't have money. Even if we buy them, it won't be enough to use up all the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds." "We have plenty of talent!" He Wenwu, the production captain of the "Shangyou" team, retorted: "We have eight carpenter masters and sixteen apprentices. The all-purpose soybean seeder was created by our cooperative. Light plows, double-furrow plows, automatic carts, handcarts, and soil leveling machines have also been successfully manufactured one after another, and we are still working on harvesters, threshers, corn shellers, and so on. We have willing carpenters, and any difficulties can be overcome."

Through presenting facts and debating, the masses unanimously supported the cooperative committee's plan.

Unexpectedly, There is Such Great Potential

People educated by the general line are full of energy, everyone strives to go upstream, and everyone is full of enthusiasm. Six hundred laborers work 100% of the time, chasing early rice fertilizer on 1,130 mu for two days and two nights, 30 dan per mu; topdressing fertilizer on 350 mu after flowering; rushing to sow two-season rice seedlings, sowing enough 15 jin per mu; making more than 100,000 dan of artificial urine; and planting 124 mu of soybeans. New-style agricultural implements that have been manufactured include: 18 all-purpose soybean seeders, 1 double-furrow plow, and a three-wheeled five-furrow plow and a water-powered water pump have been successfully trial-produced. In the face of these leap-forward facts of one day equaling twenty years, the backward and conservative people were also convinced. He Qishi said: "I never thought that our mountain cooperative had such great potential."

    “上游”社能不能再跃进？
    ——古龙社关于总路线的一场辩论
    唐佑国
    讲到罗城古龙社，它曾有过一段光荣的历史。早在1956年，就被评为广西省农业模范社；去年是县的模范社；今年5月下旬全县大检查，大评比中，再次荣获县委给予“上游社”的光荣称号。几年来，群众的生活起了根本变化，贫困，落后已经一去不复返了。正因为如此，部分社干、社员思想产生了严重的自满情绪。下面就是这个社在贯彻总路线后，能不能再跃进的一场大辩论。
    两条路线的分歧
    社干部在县学习了社会主义建设总路线之后，干劲更大了，决定在现有基础上，再来个大跃进，年底前实现水稻亩产双千斤，采用新式农具，交通运输车子化。计划倒好，谁知一向社员宣布，立刻遭到有保守思想的人的强烈反对。何启世说：“像我们这种山区，跃进到这地步，已经是止啦，还来什么‘三化’？真是‘饿狗想吃天鹅肉’……。”老农覃永曾立即附和：“我看，你们干部‘上游’上昏啦！还是稳坐钓鱼船吧！”不少群众也跟着说：“一天两餐饭，什么我们也不想要了。”这一来，社干吃惊不小。
    迷信不得
    第二天（6月9日），一个“山区能不能再跃进”的辩论，在全体社员中开展起来了。社干覃永岳列举了三年生产对比事实，驳斥了“山区不能跃进”的讲法。他说：“1956年合作化高潮时，我们社小搞，粮食增产，仅余粮就卖了十六万斤，全社三百户没有一个人向国家买粮食。1957年反‘冒进’，连‘小搞’都反掉了，结果减产了九万五千斤，30％的余粮户变成缺粮户，余粮才卖了两万斤。今年大搞，全部水田改种了头苗，种植季节提前三十天，是八年来最好的庄稼，丰收已成定局。”社员覃永胜也说：“依我看，实现‘三化’是完全有条件的。首先我们消灭了旱灾，实现两苗化；其次，田（地）基大部分已打通，小块田（地）变大块，完全可以使用新式农具；乡道1956年基本建成，只需修补一下，完全可以实现运输车子化。”说到这里，覃永胜反问：“谁能说我们没有条件跃进呢？”“我说没有。”何启世大声喊着说：“第一，我们没有制造农具的技术员；第二，没有设计师；第三，没有钱，就是买，把所有的公积金、公益金用完也不够。”“我们有的是人材！”“上游”队生产队长何文武反驳说：“我们有八个木匠师傅、十六个徒弟。万能黄豆播种机是我们社创造出来的，轻便步犁、双铧犁、自动车、手推车、平土机也先后制造成功，正在做的还有收割机、打谷机、玉米脱粒机等。我们有肯干的木匠师傅，什么困难都可以克服。”
    通过摆事实，大辩论，群众一致拥护社委规划。
    想不到还有这样大的潜力
    经过总路线教育的人们，干劲冲天，人人争上游，个个鼓干劲。六百个劳动力百分之百出工，两天两夜追早糙包胎肥一千一百三十亩，每亩三十担；花后肥三百五十亩；抢播二苗秧，每亩播足十五斤；造人造尿十万多担；种黄豆一百二十四亩。新式农具已制成的有：万能黄豆播种机十八架，双铧犁一架，三轮五铧犁、水推抽水机已试制成功。在这些一日等于二十年的飞跃前进的事实面前，落后保守的人也信服了。何启世说：“真想不到我们山区社还有这样大的潜力。”
