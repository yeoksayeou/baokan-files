Xinhua News Agency, 25th: As the motherland enters a new historical stage of technological revolution, the electricity industry workers, responsible for urban and rural electrification, recently decided to double the construction speed and put forward the bold slogan of "working hard for five years to achieve preliminary electrification of the whole country."

Now, the national electricity workers are working hard to realize this slogan. In the first five months of this year, they completed nearly twice as many capital construction tasks as in the same period last year. In many construction projects in Luoyang, Jilin, and other places, the time it took to install a generator set in the past can now be used to install six or seven sets. The design progress of various projects has also been greatly accelerated compared to the original plan. It is estimated that within this year, the installed capacity of power generation equipment put into production by national, local state-owned, and rural power stations will reach more than 2 million kilowatts, which is close to the total of all new power generation equipment added during the First Five-Year Plan. The number of above-quota power generation and supply projects started to supply electricity for the great development of industry and transportation has also increased from the original 123 to 188.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the leading agency of the national electricity industry, is currently busy formulating policies, measures, and development plans for the next few years to accelerate the realization of electrification.

Electricity is a very convenient and economical power source in modern production. It can be centrally produced by utilizing all power resources, can be transmitted over long distances to places in need through wires, and can be converted into various forms of energy according to the needs of various departments of the national economy. Widely developing electricity and applying electricity are important measures for technically transforming the national economy and continuously improving labor productivity. At present, the manufacturing capacity of China's machinery industry is still low. In addition to the electricity needs of large-scale industry, local industry and agriculture, which are undergoing a great leap forward, are also in urgent need of electricity. Based on this situation, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has determined that the path of China's electricity industry in moving towards electrification is: on the one hand, it must develop in the direction of large-scale, high-voltage, large power systems and automation, but at present, the most important thing is to find every possible way to build more small and medium-sized power stations to provide sufficient power for local industry and agriculture.

At present, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has delegated most enterprises and power systems to local management. In the construction plans recently prepared for the second half of this year and next year, nearly two-thirds of the power stations will use small and medium-sized generator sets of 12,000 kilowatts and below, which China can now produce in large quantities. In the vast rural areas below the special districts and counties with weak industrial foundations, the focus is on extensively building the smallest hydropower stations or thermal power stations. At the same time, the electricity sector is also preparing to make the electricity industry, like other industries, scattered all over the country like stars through the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan. In this way, not only will a material foundation be provided for the technological revolution, but the current uneven distribution of electricity can also be completely changed.

China's hydropower resources are very abundant, with more than 2,000 rivers distributed throughout the country, and the development conditions are also very good. Massively developing hydropower will be an important way to accelerate the realization of electrification. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the policy of "hydropower as the mainstay" for the electricity industry at the beginning of the year, thousands of technicians have been conducting survey and design work on more than 80 rivers. They plan to complete the preliminary design of more than 80 hydropower stations within this year. Most of the water conservancy projects that have been built in various provinces will be used for power generation. Some large hydropower stations that were originally scheduled to begin construction in the next year or the year after, such as Liujiaxia, Tongxia, Xinfengjiang, and Danjiangkou hydropower stations, have now decided to start construction this year ahead of schedule. The units responsible for the design and construction of these hydropower stations have also taken active measures to ensure that these hydropower stations can be put into production ahead of the original plan.

### 电力工业职工决定把建设速度加快一倍  苦干五年跨上电气化的骏马  今年内全国投入生产的发电设备容量将达二百多万瓩

    电力工业职工决定把建设速度加快一倍
    苦干五年跨上电气化的骏马
    今年内全国投入生产的发电设备容量将达二百多万瓩
    新华社25日讯　当祖国开始进入技术革命的新的历史阶段的时候，担负着城乡电气化任务的电力工业职工最近又决定把建设速度加快一倍，提出要“苦干五年，争取全国初步电气化”的豪迈口号。
    现在，全国电业职工正在为实现这一口号而努力。在今年头五个月，他们完成的基本建设任务比去年同期增加了将近一倍。洛阳、吉林等地许多建设工程过去安装一台发电机组的时间，现在可以安装六、七台。各类工程的设计进度，也比原订计划大大加快。预计在今年一年内，全国国营、地方国营和农村电站投入生产的发电设备容量将达二百多万瓩，接近于第一个五年计划期间新增加的全部发电设备的总和。为供应工业和交通运输业的大发展用电而开始建设的限额以上的发电供电工程项目，也从原定的一百二十三个增加到一百八十八个。
    全国电力工业的领导机构水利电力部，最近正忙于为加速实现电气化而制定方针措施和今后几年的发展规划。
    电是现代生产中很方便而又经济的动力。它可以利用一切动力资源来集中生产，能通过导线远距离地输送到需要的地方，并且可以根据国民经济各部门的需要转化成为各种不同的能的形态。广泛地发展电力和应用电力，这是对国民经济进行技术改造和不断提高劳动生产率的重要措施。我国目前机械工业的制造能力还低，同时除了大工业需要用电以外，正在大跃进中的地方工业和农业，也都迫切需要电力。根据这一情况，水利电力部确定我国在向电气化迈进中电力工业的道路是：一方面固然要向大型、高压、大电力系统和自动化的方向发展，但目前最重要的还是必须想尽一切办法多建设中小型的发电站，为地方工业和农业提供足够的动力。
    目前水利电力部已经把大部分企业和电力系统下放给地方管理。在最近编制的今年下半年和明年的建设计划中，有将近三分之二的电站将采用我国已能大量生产的一万二千瓩以下中小型发电机组。在工业基础薄弱的专区、县以下的广大农村中，更以广泛地建设最小型水电站或火电站为主。同时，电力部门还准备通过第二个五年计划的建设，使电力工业和其他工业一样，星罗棋布地分散在全国各地。这样，不但为技术革命提供了物质基础，目前电力分布不平衡的状况也可以得到彻底改变。
    我国的水力资源非常丰富，有二千多条河流分布在全国各地，开发条件也很好。大量地发展水力发电事业，将是加快实现电气化的重要途径。自从中共中央在年初提出电力工业以发展“水电为主”的方针以后，全国已有几千名技术人员在八十多条河流上进行勘测设计工作。他们计划在今年内就要完成八十多个水电站的初步设计。各省已经建成的水利工程，将大部分被利用来发电。一些原定在明后年才能开始建设的大水电站，例如刘家峡、青铜峡、新丰江、丹江口等水电站，现在都决定提前在今年施工。负责这几个水电站设计施工的单位，并且采取积极措施，争取使这些水电站能够比原定计划提前投入生产。
