    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    83　Our crimson flowers of the iron-stemmed begonia bloom close to the branches, hence people call us the "close-to-stem begonia." Sometimes it's written as "iron-stem," which feels even more meaningful; our branches are indeed somewhat iron-like. To be precise, we should be called "wooden peach," a good name that already existed in the "Airs of the States." The stem can be used as a cane, and the fruit can be steeped in wine or preserved in honey, willing to sacrifice ourselves, not expecting jade in return. (Note)
    (Note) "Airs of the States, The Songs of Wei, Papaya": "You throw me a wooden peach, and I repay you with jade."
    84　The kapok in Lingnan is called cotton tree, and people in Lingnan also call us hero tree. Tall trees can be covered with large red flowers, and producing heroes requires such demeanor. But our wood is light and not very useful, and our cotton is very different from cotton flower. Fortunately, Panzhihua in Sichuan also produces iron ore, and the place is named after the flower, which also brings us great honor.
    85　Daylily. We are yellow lilies, generally called golden needles, and everyone knows us better as a vegetable than as a flower. Saying we can make you forget your worries is completely unfounded. We are not a tranquilizer, so how can we make the worried not worry? For example, if you are worried about not being both red and expert, you certainly won't eat a dozen large bowls of golden needles. Unless you work hard to carry out self-revolution, we cannot remove even a tiny bit of your worries.
    86　Red Spider Lily. We are wild grasses, and the flowers and leaves cannot meet. In autumn, flower stalks are drawn out, and red flowers bloom in clusters. The tubular flower splits into six petals, and the stamens protrude from the flowers. Only after the flowers wither do the dark green leaves emerge like garlic. We are poisonous all over, but please don't be afraid. We have many uses, depending on how you use us. We can induce vomiting, treat ringworm, and cure unnamed carbuncles. Applying the juice to mud walls can also prevent rats.
    87　Iris tectorum. We are one of the irises, also known as crested iris. The flower shape is very large, and the color is based on purple. Common irises resemble flying kites, and we are airplanes, spreading our wings to make great plans. Each emerald leaf is a sword out of its scabbard, and each capsule is a bomb with its pin pulled. Why say it so aggressively? Because we want to inspire people to wage war on the Earth!

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    83　铁干海棠猩红色的花朵贴着枝干开放，因此，人们叫我们为贴干海棠。有时写成铁干，觉得更有意思，我们的枝干是有些和铁相似。认真说我们倒应该称为木桃，“国风”上早就有了这个好名号。干可以为杖，实可以浸酒蜜渍，宁愿自我牺牲，不望琼瑶之报。（注）
    （注）国风卫风木瓜：“投我以木桃，报之以琼瑶。”
    84　攀枝花攀枝花在岭南就叫作木棉，岭南人又叫我们为英雄树。高大的乔木能戴满大红花，生产英雄具有这样的风度。但我们的木材轻松，没有什么用，我们的棉絮也和棉花大不相同。幸喜四川也有攀枝花产生铁矿，地以花命名，使我们也沾了大光。
    85　萱草我们是黄百合，一般就叫作金针，作为菜比作为花大家知道得更深。说我们可以忘忧，完全是莫须有，并不是麻醉剂，怎能使愁者不愁？比如你在发愁，怕不能又红又专，你总不会把金针吃上十几大碗。除非你自己努力进行自我革命，我们不能把你的忧愁除掉一星星。
    86　石蒜我们是野草，花和叶不能见面，秋天抽出花梗开出红花成团，筒状花裂成六瓣，花蕊挺出花间；花谢后才标出浓绿的叶片如蒜。我们全身都有毒，但请不要害怕，我们的用处很多，看你怎样用法。可以催吐、治癣，并医治无名肿毒；把浆汁涂入泥壁中还可以防鼠。
    87　玉蝉花我们是鸢尾之一，别名花菖蒲，花形很大，颜色以紫色为基础。一般的鸢尾花和飞鸢相仿佛，我们就是飞机，正展翅作雄图。一张张翠叶是出了鞘的宝剑，一颗颗蒴果是拉了线的炸弹。为什么要说得这样剑拔弩张？因为要鼓舞人心，向地球开战！
