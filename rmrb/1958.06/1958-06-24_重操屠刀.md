    Resuming the Butcher's Knife

    On June 20th, fifty American-made fighter-bombers capable of dropping atomic bombs officially joined the West German armed forces. It is said that West Germany has once again become an air force nation.

    In reporting this news, the Associated Press called this army a "new" air force. In fact, it is an "old" air force at its core. It is no different from Hitler's air force, including its white-bordered black iron cross insignia. The head of this air force, Lieutenant Colonel Barkhorn, is not without credentials either. He was a so-called "air hero" during World War II and received Hitler's "Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords."

    Think of the misfortunes suffered by London, Coventry and other places during World War II. How much damage was caused by those planes painted with the white-bordered black iron cross! Now these executioners have obtained new killing weapons from American imperialism. This cannot but be a dangerous signal. However, times have changed. The resounding call for peace issued by the European working class on the 22nd is the answer to the war preparations of the United States and West Germany.

    重操屠刀
    6月20日，五十架美制的能投掷原子弹的战斗轰炸机正式参加了西德国防军。据说，这样一来西德又再度成了空军国家。
    美联社在报道这则消息时，把这支军队称为“新”空军。其实压根儿是一支“老”牌空军，它跟希特勒的空军没什么两样，包括它的白边黑色铁十字的标志在内。这支空军的头子巴尔克霍尔恩中校，也不是没有来历的，他曾是第二次世界大战的所谓“空中英雄”，得过希特勒的“勇士剑和橡树叶十字勋章”。
    想一想第二次大战中伦敦、考文垂等地所遭到的厄运吧，那些漆着白边黑色铁十字标志的飞机造成了多大的损害！现在这些刽子手又从美帝国主义那里拿到了新的杀人武器。这不能不是一个危险的信号。不过，时代不同了。欧洲工人阶级22日发出的响亮的和平呼声就是对美国和西德这种战争准备的答复。
