Studious and Diligent, Persevering, Illiterate Becomes Expert
Cao Yixiu Masters the Life Habits of Rats

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Yunnan Daily: The Kunming Branch of the Chinese Medical Association recently held a fascinating academic lecture on the life habits of rats. The speaker was Cao Yixiu, a 64-year-old illiterate Dai woman. The audience included more than 40 senior intellectuals and technicians from the Kunming medical community. Fan Yongjing, a young Han Chinese farmer, also presented a report alongside Cao Yixiu.
    That afternoon, on a field on the southern outskirts of Kunming, the speaker, carrying a pickaxe, walked into a recently harvested wheat field with the audience. Cao Yixiu spoke as she walked. She said that the location of rats' dwellings varies with the seasons. Cao Yixiu continued: When we find a rat hole, how can we tell from the signs at the entrance whether there are rats inside and how many?
    They came to a rat hole in the field. The audience asked, "Are there any rats here?" Cao Yixiu replied, "Definitely." The audience then asked, "How many rats are there?" Cao Yixiu looked at the rat hole and said, "Only large rats. At most one or two." The audience was somewhat skeptical. Cao Yixiu said, "Okay, let's dig it up and see." Sure enough, two large rats were caught inside the hole. The audience asked Cao Yixiu why she could make such an accurate judgment. She replied: First, there is a lot of loose soil at the entrance of the rat hole, the soil is fresh and smooth, there are no spider webs inside the hole, and the grass next to the hole is flattened, which indicates that rats are definitely coming in and out; second, there is water next to the hole, and there is grain on the recently harvested dikes, which indicates that rats are likely to live there. The audience further asked why she could determine that there were only large rats. She said: The most common rat holes have two doors, front and back, with the back door often in a hidden place. After rats give birth, they use loose soil to block the front door, first to prevent snakes from stealing stored grain and harming the young rats, and second, because going through the front door is easily discovered by people. Now this hole is not blocked, indicating that there are only large rats.
    People then came to a rat hole built next to a sewage ditch. There were a few withered grasses left in front of the hole, and much of the green grass next to the hole had been bitten off. Cao Yixiu humorously said: The rats in this hole are about to "cooperate." If the rats haven't gone out to cool off, they must be in the hole making a nest for the soon-to-be-born baby rats. At this time, Fan Yongjing jumped into the sewage ditch, blocked the back hole with a clod of earth, and swung the pickaxe to dig from the front. People stood on both sides of the ditch watching intently. The hole was dug deeper and deeper, and people's hearts beat faster and faster. Suddenly, two fat rats jumped out of the edge of the pickaxe in a panic. Their heads had just emerged when they were caught. People felt the fat belly of the female rat and estimated that ten or so baby rats would be born in another week.
    Cao Yixiu's rich knowledge of rat life habits has been accumulated through long-term practice. Initially, her knowledge of rat life habits was limited. What prompted her to study rats was to eradicate the plague. Her hometown, Lianghe County, was occupied by Japanese imperialism in 1945. The extremely cruel imperialists released a large number of rats and spread the plague. Many villages suffered from "itchy disease," and people often died. In 1951, the Party and the government sent plague prevention personnel to rescue the area. Only then did they realize that "itchy disease" was the plague spread by the Japanese imperialists using rats. To eliminate the plague, rats had to be eliminated. From then on, Cao Yixiu would always bring a hoe with her when she went out to work in the morning, day after day, carefully watching for rat holes along the way. If she found one, she would immediately dig it up. Later, she thought that to completely eliminate rats, she had to understand their living habits. After that, before each dig, she would carefully observe the surrounding conditions and natural environment of the hole, the situation inside the hole, and so on, conducting persistent research. From 1951 to the present, Cao Yixiu has eliminated more than 10,000 rats and conducted careful comparative observations. After the Party put forward the call to eliminate the four pests in 1956, the Lianghe County People's Government of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture specially hired a horse for her, allowing her to ride the horse to villages and hamlets in Lianghe and Longchuan to explain and impart rat-killing experience to cadres, the masses, and students, and to perform practical demonstrations.
    The senior intellectuals and technicians from the Kunming medical community who attended the lecture felt they had gained a lot. They gave a very high scientific evaluation of the knowledge of rat life habits that Cao Yixiu and Fan Yongjing had mastered, and thus felt that they should learn from local experts in the future.

    曹依秀掌握老鼠生活规律
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：中华医学会昆明分会最近举行了一次引人入胜的关于老鼠生活习性的学术讲演。主讲人是一个六十四岁的、没有念过书的傣族妇女曹依秀。听讲的人有昆明医学界的四十多个高级知识分子和技术人员。与曹依秀一同作报告的还有汉族青年农民范永镜。
    这天下午，在昆明南郊的一块田边，主讲人扛着十字镐和听讲的人一起走进刚刚收割过的麦田里。曹依秀边走边说。她说，季节不同，老鼠的住地也有所不同。曹依秀接着说：当我们找到了一个老鼠洞时，怎样才能从洞口的迹象，判断有没有老鼠？有多少老鼠呢？
    他们来到地里发现了一个鼠洞。听讲的人问道：“这里有没有老鼠？”曹依秀答复说：“一定有”。听讲的人又问：“有多少老鼠？”曹依秀看了看鼠洞，说：“只有大老鼠。最多有一只到两只。”听讲的人有些怀疑。曹依秀说：“好吧，那么现在就挖开来瞧。”果然在洞内捉住了两只大老鼠。听讲的人问曹依秀为什么能够作出这样准确的判断，她回答说：第一、鼠洞口有很多松土，土很新鲜、光滑，洞内没有蜘蛛网，洞口旁的小草也被压倒，这说明一定有老鼠出入；第二、洞旁有水，刚收割过的田埂上有粮，这说明老鼠有可能住下来。听讲的人又追问为什么能断定只有大老鼠呢？她说：最常见的鼠洞都有前、后两个门，后门多在隐蔽的地方。老鼠生儿后要用松土把前门阻塞起来，一则怕蛇偷吃存粮，侵害小鼠，二则走前门易被人发现。现在这个洞没有阻塞，可见只有大鼠。
    人们又来到了一个筑在污水沟旁边的老鼠洞前，洞前残留着几根枯草，洞旁的青草被咬断了许多。曹依秀有风趣地说：这个洞里的老鼠快要“合作化”了，如果老鼠没有出去纳凉，就一定在洞里为即将出世的小老鼠做窝。这时，范永镜跳下污水沟，用土块堵住了后洞，抡起十字镐从前面挖起洞来。人们站在两岸聚精会神地看着，洞越挖越深，人们的心越扣越紧，蓦地两只肥大的老鼠从镐锋边惊惶地跳出来，它的头刚露出就被捉住了。人们用手摸摸那雌鼠肥大的肚子，估计再过一个星期就有十来只小鼠出世了。
    曹依秀关于老鼠生活习性的丰富知识，是从长期实践中积累起来的。最初，她对老鼠的生活习性所知有限，促使她研究老鼠的，是为了扑灭鼠疫。她的家乡梁河县在1945年被日本帝国主义占领期间，极为残酷的帝国主义者曾经放出了大量老鼠、散布鼠疫，许多村寨发生“痒子病”，经常死人；1951年，党和政府派来了鼠疫防治人员进行抢救，这时才知道“痒子病”是日本帝国主义者用老鼠散布的鼠疫，要消灭鼠疫，必须消灭老鼠。从此，曹依秀几年如一日地在早晨外出工作时，就一定要带着锄头去，沿路留心看有无鼠洞，发现了立即就挖。后来她又想到，要彻底消灭老鼠，必须摸清它的生活习惯，以后在每次挖洞前，她就留心观察洞口周围的情况和自然环境、洞内的情形等等，顽强地进行研究。从1951年至现在，曹依秀一共消灭了一万多头老鼠，进行了细心的比较观察。在1956年党提出除四害的号召后，德宏傣族景颇族自治州梁河县人民政府专门给她雇了一匹马，让她骑着这马经常去梁河、陇川各村、各寨，向干部、群众和学生们讲解传授灭鼠的经验，并作实际操作表演。
    这次听讲的昆明医学界的高级知识分子和技术人员都感到收获很大。对于曹依秀和范永镜已掌握到的关于老鼠生活习性的知识，他们从科学上给予了相当高的评价，从而感到今后要好好向土专家学习。
