Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 13th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued its debate on the Algerian question yesterday.

    Representatives of seventeen Asian-African countries, including Indonesia, Iraq, and the United Arab Republic, submitted a proposal to the General Assembly. The proposal calls for the recognition of the Algerian people's right to independence; points out that the current situation in Algeria poses a threat to international peace and security; and requests the French government and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to hold negotiations to seek a solution that conforms to the United Nations Charter. The proposal also recalls past resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on the Algerian question. These resolutions have called for a peaceful, democratic, and just resolution of the Algerian question, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, through appropriate means.
    Many countries' representatives spoke at yesterday's meeting. They refuted the notion that the Algerian question is a French "internal affair," pointing out that the war France is waging in Algeria is a colonial war.
    The representatives accused the French government of stubbornly refusing to negotiate and attempting to continue its colonial rule in Algeria.
    At yesterday's meeting, the only representative who publicly defended the French colonialist position was the representative of Cuba.

    亚非十七国代表向联大政委会提出提案
    要求承认阿尔及利亚独立权利
    据新华社13日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会昨天继续就阿尔及利亚问题进行辩论。
    印度尼西亚、伊拉克、阿拉伯联合共和国等十七个亚非国家代表团向大会提出了一项提案。这个提案要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利；指出目前在阿尔及利亚的局势是对国际和平和安全的威胁；要求法国政府和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府举行谈判，以求得符合于联合国宪章的解决办法。提案还追述了过去联合国大会关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议。这些决议都要求通过适当的办法，使阿尔及利亚问题求得符合于联合国宪章原则的和平、民主和公正的解决。
    许多国家的代表在昨天的会议上发了言。他们驳斥了所谓阿尔及利亚问题是法国“内政”问题的说法，指出法国在阿尔及利亚从事的战争是殖民战争。
    代表们指责法国政府顽固地拒绝谈判，而企图继续在阿尔及利亚实行殖民统治。
    在昨天会上发言公开为法国殖民主义立场辩护的，只有古巴的代表。
