Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 8th: The All-African People's Conference solemnly opened today in Accra, the capital of Ghana.

　　Approximately three hundred representatives and observers from all parts of Africa attended the meeting to discuss the issue of opposing imperialist enslavement and striving for national independence.

　　Inside the conference hall hung a huge map of Africa, which read: "African People Unite! We have nothing to lose but our chains, and we will regain the entire continent. We want to achieve freedom and human dignity." The hall was also decorated with slogans such as "Colonialists Get Out of Africa" and "Long Live the Union of African Republics."

　　Kwame Nkrumah, Chairman of the Ghana People's Convention and Prime Minister of Ghana, delivered the opening speech. He said that this conference will "formulate new strategies and tactics to realize our desired aspirations and goals – namely, the freedom and independence of Africa."

　　He mentioned five important issues to be discussed at the meeting: colonialism, imperialism, and racism; the arbitrary division of the African continent and the resulting border disputes; tribalism, racial laws, and religious segregation measures; the status of traditional authorities, especially the issue of developing a free and democratic society; and the Union of African States.

　　The Ghanaian Prime Minister, wearing a robe today, emphasized the significance of unity in his speech.

　　He also spoke of the achievements of Ghana's independence. He said, however, that unless his country's freedom is linked to the liberation of Africa, it is "meaningless." He said: "We have not departed from this premise, nor will we waver in the slightest until the ultimate goal is achieved, until the last trace of colonialism and imperialism is erased from the African continent."

　　Nkrumah also stated that Ghana supports "all forms of non-violent action" taken to promote Africa's "legitimate rights and aspirations."

　　Subsequently, the delegates attending the conference began their meetings.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 7th: Bozanyo, Chairman of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference and Foreign Minister of Ghana, said at a press conference this afternoon that approximately two hundred delegates, twenty observers, and sixty fraternal representatives from twenty to thirty countries will participate in the All-African People's Conference, scheduled to open here on the morning of the 8th.

　　Bozanyo said that it has been suggested to establish five committees and three organizational committees to handle the various issues facing the conference.

　　The five committees will discuss the following issues respectively: first, colonialism and imperialism; second, racism and laws and measures regarding racial discrimination; third, tribalism and religious segregation, as well as the status of traditional systems under colonial rule or in free democratic societies; fourth, adjusting existing borders and merging geographically regional countries into federations or confederations, and finally merging into a Pan-African federation of a free and independent United States of Africa; fifth, considering the establishment of permanent institutions.

　　The three organizational committees are: the Propaganda Committee, the Proposal Committee, and the Credentials Committee.

　　Bozanyo also said that only political parties and trade union organizations have the right to vote, with each organization casting one vote.

　　When a reporter raised a question about the agenda, Bozanyo replied that the agenda had not yet been finalized, and he expected it to be finalized after the meeting on the afternoon of the 8th.

　　Bozanyo also said that the United States has sent more "fraternal representatives" and "observers" than any other country outside Africa. People here believe that this clearly shows the United States' extraordinary interest in this conference.

    非洲人民团结争取独立和自由
    全非人民大会开幕
    恩克鲁玛说要在非洲大陆清除殖民主义痕迹
    新华社阿克拉8日电  全非人民大会今天在加纳首都阿克拉隆重开幕。
    来自全非洲各地的大约三百名代表和观察员出席这个会议，来讨论反对帝国主义奴役和争取民族独立的问题。
    在大会会议厅内挂着一幅巨大的非洲地图，上面写着：“非洲人民团结起来！我们失去的只有枷锁，我们将重新得到的是整个大陆。我们要取得自由和人的尊严。”会场周围还挂着“殖民主义者滚出非洲去”、“非洲各共和国联盟万岁”等等标语。
    加纳人民大会党主席、加纳总理恩克鲁玛致开幕词。他说，这次大会将“制订新的战略和战术，以便实现我们所希望的愿望和目标——即非洲的自由和独立”。
    他提到了会议将讨论的五个重要问题：殖民主义、帝国主义和种族主义；专横地划分非洲大陆，以及因而造成的边境纠纷；部族制度、种族法以及宗教隔离措施；传统当局的地位，尤其是发展一个自由民主的社会的问题；非洲国家联盟。
    这位加纳总理今天身穿长袍，他在讲话中强调团结的意义。
    他还谈到加纳独立的成就。他说，但是，除非他的国家的自由同非洲的解放联系起来，这是“毫无意义的”。他说：“我们并没有离开这个前提，我们也不会丝毫动摇，直到实现最后目标，直到殖民主义和帝国主义的最后一丝痕迹从非洲大陆上被清除的时候为止。”
    恩克鲁玛同时表示，加纳支持为了促进非洲的“合法权利和愿望”而采取的“各种形式的非暴力行动”。
    随后，参加大会的代表们开始举行会议。
    新华社阿克拉7日电  全非人民大会总务委员会主席、加纳外交部长博齐约今天下午在记者招待会上说，将有来自二十个到三十个国家的大约两百个代表、二十个观察员和六十个兄弟代表参加预定8日上午在这里开幕的全非人民大会。
    博齐约说，已经建议成立五个委员会和三个组织委员会来处理大会所面临的各种问题。
    这五个委员会将分别讨论以下问题：第一、殖民主义和帝国主义；第二、种族主义以及关于种族歧视的法律和措施；第三、部族制度和宗教隔离制度以及在殖民统治下或在自由民主社会下的传统制度的地位；第四、调整现有的疆界，以及把地理上的区域性国家并成联邦或邦联最后合并成为一个自由和独立的非洲合众国的泛非联邦；第五、考虑成立常设机构。
    三个组织委员会是：宣传委员会、提案委员会和资格审查委员会。
    博齐约还说，只有政党和工会组织有投票权，每一个组织投一票。
    有记者提出关于议程的问题，博齐约回答说，议程还没有确定，他预料将在8日下午的会议以后确定。
    博齐约还说，美国所派的“兄弟代表”和“观察员”比非洲以外的其他任何国家多得多。这里人士认为，这清楚地表明美国异乎寻常地对这次大会表示很大兴趣。
