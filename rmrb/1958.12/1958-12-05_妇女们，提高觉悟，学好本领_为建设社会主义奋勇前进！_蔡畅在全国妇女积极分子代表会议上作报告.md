Xinhua News Agency, December 4th. Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered a report today to the National Conference of Women Activists in Socialist Construction, entitled "Raise Awareness, Learn Skills, and Forge Ahead Vigorously for Socialist Construction."

    Cai Chang first summarized the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward nationwide. She said: In this upsurge of socialist construction, under the leadership of the Party, the number of women of all ethnic groups participating in social labor has increased unprecedentedly, the scope of labor has expanded unprecedentedly, and they have contributed tremendous strength to the comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In the Great Leap Forward, women's communist ideological awareness and enthusiasm for building socialism have been greatly enhanced, their spirits are high, their fighting will is high, and they are firmly on the path of socialism.

    Women should become a main force in agricultural production, continue to play an active role in industrial production, and should actively participate in cultural education, medical and health care, collective living welfare, and various service undertakings.

    She said: The achievements of the 1958 Great Leap Forward are great, but these achievements are still far from the goals required to fully build a socialist society and the highest ideals of future communism. We still have many arduous tasks ahead of us, so we must never be satisfied with today's achievements. We must carry forward our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, continue to work hard, and advance victoriously. The great historical task of the Chinese people at this stage is to build socialism. That is, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, according to the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party, and through the social organization form of the people's commune, gradually building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science, and creating conditions for the gradual transition from socialist society to communist society in the future. This is also the glorious task of Chinese women.

    Cai Chang pointed out: 1959 is the second year of the three years of hard struggle. Successfully completing next year's construction tasks is of decisive significance for fundamentally changing the face of our country and accelerating socialist construction. Chinese women must, under the leadership of the Party and together with the people of the whole country, complete and overfulfill the state's grand and arduous construction plan for 1959, strive for continued high-speed growth in steel and grain production, and strive for a greater leap forward upsurge in various socialist constructions.

    She said: The production and construction tasks facing us are enormous. To complete this task, we need women to work more actively and produce more. Women should become a main force in agricultural production, continue to play an active role in industrial production, and should actively participate in cultural education, medical and health care, collective living welfare, and various service undertakings. In all jobs suitable for women, we should gradually replace men with women so that the labor force of the entire society can be more rationally arranged. Next, Cai Chang specifically elaborated on the great significance of active labor for socialist construction and the thorough liberation of women.

    Collective living welfare work is a major issue related to the lives of all the people, the promotion of production, the consolidation of the commune, socialist construction, and the thorough liberation of women. It is a lofty cause that is of great political significance and serves the people.

    Cai Chang emphasized in her report that we must vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings well. She said that our purpose of actively laboring and developing production is to gradually improve the lives of the people. Since the communization of the people's communes, in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a large number of collective living welfare facilities such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and maternity hospitals have been established in various places, turning the scattered housework of each household into a public undertaking of society. This is a major revolution in people's lives. Collective living welfare work is a major issue related to the lives of all the people, the promotion of production, the consolidation of the commune, socialist construction, and the thorough liberation of women. It is a lofty cause that is of great political significance and serves the people. Some people do not attach importance to this cause, look down on this kind of labor, and are unwilling to do it. This is not right. Both men and women should actively participate in and support this cause and do it well. Now women account for the majority of those working in these jobs, which is our glory. Among the comrades present, there are many model cooks, educators, childcare workers, health workers, midwives, seamstresses, and administrators. You have already played an active role in leading the masses to run collective living welfare undertakings well, and in the future, you need to continue to carry forward the spirit of diligent and earnest service to the people and do this undertaking even better.

    What has been and is being destroyed is the old feudal patriarchal family, and what has been and is being established is the new democratic and united family. She said: With the establishment of collective living welfare undertakings, women participate more in social labor, receive remuneration according to their labor like men, and family life is more democratic and united. We advocate abolishing the unreasonable patriarchal system inherited from history, but family life is still necessary. The family life we need is a family life of equality between men and women, respect for the old and love for the young, and democratic unity. After children enter nurseries, kindergartens, and schools, they are educated by society, but parents still have the responsibility to educate them, especially to assist childcare institutions and work together to educate the children well. Family members should also take care of and help each other in life, and economic expenditures should be planned together. Under the principle of not hindering collective production and collective life, it is permissible to cook some meals, raise some small livestock and poultry, etc., in the family. This is the personal freedom that can exist in a large collective. Rural communes should plan new residential areas and build houses suitable for the reunion of men, women, old, and young in each family. Some people believe that after the collectivization of life, the family has been destroyed. Yes, we have been and are destroying the old feudal patriarchal family, and we have been and are establishing a new democratic and united family. This kind of family is more beautiful and happier than at any time in history.

    Study politics, raise awareness, study technology, and learn the skills to build socialism.

    In her report, Cai Chang earnestly encouraged women activists and the broad masses of women to strive to study politics, improve their communist ideological awareness, diligently study technology, learn culture, and improve their skills in building socialism in order to play a greater active role in socialist construction. She pointed out that now, under the leadership of the Party, socialist and communist education movements are being widely and deeply carried out throughout the country. Our women must actively participate in this movement to further improve their communist ideological awareness and give play to their enthusiasm for building socialism. She called on all women to firmly establish the idea of loving the people's communes and to actively participate in the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes with the attitude of masters. Through the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and great character posters, they should participate in solving some important issues in the communes. They should think of the interests of the communes everywhere and seriously treat all undertakings of the communes. She called on women to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies; and to put in hard work to better and more study technology. First of all, they must learn professional skills in their own positions, and strive to be proficient and expert. On the basis of being proficient in one profession, they should further learn multiple technologies and strive to be versatile all-rounders who are both workers and farmers, and capable of both literary and military skills. She also pointed out that women must learn to use new tools, strive to improve tools, carry out technological innovation, and boldly invent and create. She said: Culture is a tool for building socialism and communism. To learn technology and improve our skills, we must study culture.

    We must care for people and cherish people. Paying attention to women's physical health and taking care of women's special needs is a matter related to the sustained labor of half of the nation's labor force.

    In her report, Cai Chang particularly pointed out that we should pay attention to physical health and maintain vigorous energy. She said: Chairman Mao often taught us to care for people and cherish people, and to effectively guarantee people's health and safety. We must regard the work of caring for people as an extremely important task. We must improve working conditions as much as possible, properly solve the problem of eating and clothing, continue to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests, develop medical and health undertakings, and combine work and rest rhythmically, with work and leisure. In addition to the above general requirements, women have special requirements. Menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding are natural phenomena in women's physiology. Whether women rest well and recuperate well during pregnancy and childbirth has a significant impact on their lifelong health. She pointed out that this is also a matter related to the sustained labor of half of the nation's labor force. She said: To ensure women's health and safety, we must rely on the common concern of everyone in society, especially on the attention of our women. She asked the women activists present to not only take the lead in doing a good job in production, but also take the lead in arranging their lives well, and to discuss with the masses, take measures, and establish systems to ensure good sleep and rest. She said: Women are most able to understand women's needs, and you must care for the women around you with utmost care. The greater their enthusiasm, the more attention should be paid to their physical health and safety; the more attention is paid to their health and safety, the more energetic and persistent they will be, and the more they can guarantee the leap forward again and again in production and construction.

    She also especially wished all women activists to always listen to the Party's words, constantly improve their communist awareness, wholeheartedly and faithfully be loyal to the people, and be loyal to the communist cause. They should continue to play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridging role in the ideological, production, and life aspects of the masses.

    Cai Chang finally said: The task of socialist construction is before us, and the beautiful communist ideal inspires us. We are using our own hands to carry out a great and glorious cause that no predecessors have ever done. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our women across the country must raise their awareness, learn their skills, and forge ahead vigorously for socialist construction!

    Cai Chang's report lasted for two hours. Her report was warmly welcomed by the whole audience.

    The conference will continue on the 5th.

    妇女们，提高觉悟，学好本领  为建设社会主义奋勇前进！
    蔡畅在全国妇女积极分子代表会议上作报告
    新华社4日讯  中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅，今天向全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议作了题为“提高觉悟，学好本领，为建设社会主义奋勇前进”的报告。
    蔡畅首先综述了全国大跃进的伟大成就。她说：在这个社会主义建设高潮中，我国各族妇女在党的领导下，参加社会劳动的人数空前增多，劳动范围空前扩大，对全面大跃进贡献了巨大的力量。妇女们在大跃进中，共产主义思想觉悟和建设社会主义的积极性有了更大的提高，精神焕发，斗志昂扬，坚定地走社会主义道路。
    妇女在农业生产上要成为一支主力军，在工业生产上继续发挥积极作用，在文化教育、医药卫生、集体生活福利和各项服务性事业方面更应该积极参加。
    她说：1958年大跃进的成就是伟大的，但是这些成就，同完全建成社会主义社会所要求达到的目标相比，同将来共产主义的最高理想相比，还差得很远。在我们面前还有许多艰巨工作，因此我们绝不能满足于今天的成绩，一定要发扬优点，克服缺点，继续努力，乘胜前进。我国人民现阶段的伟大历史任务是建设社会主义。就是在中国共产党的领导下，根据党所提出的社会主义建设的总路线，经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，逐步把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，并为将来由社会主义社会逐步过渡到共产主义社会创造条件。这也正是我国妇女的光荣任务。
    蔡畅指出：1959年是苦战三年的第二年，胜利地完成明年的建设任务，对于基本改变我国面貌，对于加速社会主义建设，具有决定的意义。我国妇女一定要在党的领导下和全国人民一起，完成和超额完成1959年国家宏伟而艰巨的建设计划，争取钢铁和粮食产量继续高速度地增长，争取社会主义各项建设出现更大的跃进高潮。
    她说：摆在我们面前的生产建设任务是巨大的，要完成这个任务，需要我们妇女更加积极劳动，努力生产。妇女在农业生产上要成为一支主力军，在工业生产上继续发挥积极作用，在文化教育、医药卫生、集体生活福利和各项服务性事业方面更应该积极参加。要在所有适合妇女担任的工作岗位上，逐步作到以女替男，使整个社会的劳动力能够得到更合理的安排。接着，蔡畅具体阐明了积极劳动对于社会主义建设和妇女彻底解放的重大意义。
    集体生活福利工作，是关系全体人民生活、关系促进生产、巩固公社、关系社会主义建设、关系妇女彻底解放的大事。是具有重大政治意义的、为人民服务的崇高事业。
    蔡畅在报告中着重指出要大力办好集体生活福利事业。她说，我们积极劳动，发展生产的目的，是为了逐步改善人民的生活。人民公社化以来，为了适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，各地举办了大量的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院等集体生活福利设施，使一家一户的分散的家务劳动，变成了社会的公共事业，这是人民生活上的一个大革命。集体生活福利工作，是关系全体人民生活，关系促进生产、巩固公社，关系社会主义建设，关系妇女彻底解放的大事。是具有重大政治意义的、为人民服务的崇高事业。有的人不重视这一事业，看不起这种劳动，不愿意去作，这是不对的。不论男的、女的，都要积极参加并支援这个事业，把这个事业办好。现在在这些工作岗位上作工作的妇女占多数，这是我们的光荣。在座的同志中，有不少模范的炊事员、教养员、保育员、卫生员、助产员、缝纫员、管理员，你们在带动群众办好集体生活福利事业中，已经起了积极作用，今后需要继续发扬勤勤恳恳、切切实实的为人民服务的精神，把这项事业办得更好。
    已经并正在破坏的是旧的封建的家长制的家庭，已经并正在建立的是新的民主团结的家庭。她说：办了集体生活福利事业，妇女更多地参加了社会劳动，和男子一样地按劳动领取报酬，家庭生活更加民主团结。我们主张废除历史上遗留下来的不合理的家长制，但是，家庭生活还是必要的。我们需要的家庭生活，是男女平等、尊老爱幼、民主团结的家庭生活。孩子进了托儿所、幼儿园、学校之后，由社会来教育，父母仍旧有教育的责任，特别要协助儿童教养机关，共同努力，把孩子教养好。一家人还要在生活上互相照顾和帮助，经济开支还要共同计划。在不妨碍集体生产、集体生活的原则下，在家庭里作点饭菜，养点小家畜、家禽等等，这是大集体中可以有的个人自由。农村公社规划新居民点和修建房屋，要适宜于每个家庭男女老幼的团聚。有人认为生活集体化以后，家庭被破坏了。是的，我们已经并正在破坏旧的封建的家长制的家庭，我们已经并正在建立新的民主团结的家庭，这种家庭比历史上任何时期都更加美好和幸福。
    学习政治，提高觉悟，钻研技术，学好建设社会主义的本领。
    蔡畅在报告中，恳切地勉励妇女积极分子和广大妇女群众，为了在社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的积极作用，必须努力学习政治，提高共产主义思想觉悟，刻苦钻研技术，学习文化，提高建设社会主义的本领。她指出，现在全国各地，在党的领导下，正在广泛深入地开展社会主义、共产主义教育运动，我们妇女要积极参加这个运动，更进一步提高共产主义的思想觉悟，发挥建设社会主义的积极性。她要求全体妇女都要巩固地树立热爱人民公社的思想，都要以主人翁态度积极参加整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，通过大鸣大放大辩论的方法，参与解决公社中的一些重要问题。要处处为公社的利益着想，认真对待公社的一切事业。她要求妇女努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作和党的政策；并且下苦功夫更好更多地学习技术，首先要在自己的岗位上，学会专业的技能，努力作到熟练和精通，在精通一门专业的基础上，进一步学会多种技术，争取作亦工亦农、能文能武、多才多艺的多面手。她还指出，妇女们一定要学会使用新工具，努力改良工具，进行技术革新，大胆发明创造。她说：文化是建设社会主义、共产主义的工具，我们要学好技术，提高本领，一定要学习文化。
    要关心人，爱护人。注意妇女身体的健康，照顾妇女的特殊要求，是关系到全国一半劳动大军持久劳动的问题。
    蔡畅在报告中特别指出，要注意身体的健康，保持旺盛干劲。她说：毛主席经常教导我们，要关心人，爱护人，要切实保障人们的健康和安全。我们要把关心人的工作，作为极为重要的工作来做。要尽可能改善劳动条件，妥善地解决吃饭穿衣问题，继续开展除四害运动，发展医药卫生事业，还要把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来，有劳有逸。除了上述一般要求以外，妇女还有特殊要求。来月经、怀孕、生孩子、奶孩子，是妇女的生理上自然的现象。在孕期、产期，是不是休息得好，调养得好，对妇女一辈子的健康有重大的关系。她指出，这也是关系到全国一半劳动大军持久劳动的问题。她说：保障妇女的健康和安全，要靠社会上大家共同关怀，特别要靠我们妇女的注意。她要求到会的妇女积极分子们既要带头搞好生产，也要带头安排好生活，并要同群众商量，采取措施，确定制度，保证睡好，休息好。她说：妇女最能体贴妇女的要求，你们对周围的妇女群众，一定要无微不至的关心。越是他们的干劲大，就越要注意她们的身体健康和安全；越是注意她们的健康和安全，她们就会干劲更足、更持久，就能保证生产建设事业跃进再跃进。
    她还特别祝望全体妇女积极分子永远听党的话，不断地提高共产主义觉悟，全心全意地忠实于人民，忠实于共产主义事业，要在群众的思想、生产、生活各方面，继续起带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。
    蔡畅最后说：社会主义建设的任务摆在我们面前，美好的共产主义理想鼓舞着我们，我们正在用自己的双手，进行着前人从来没有作过的伟大光荣的事业，我们全国妇女要在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，提高觉悟，学好本领，为建设社会主义奋勇前进。
    蔡畅的报告历时二小时。她的报告受到全场极为热烈的欢迎。
    5日，大会将继续举行。
