Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 1st: Xinhua County, Hunan Province, through the consolidation of existing native iron and steel smelting furnaces, and after carrying out the "Five Determinations" work of fixing locations, fixing groups, fixing types, fixing personnel, and fixing leadership, has established twelve iron and steel bases, realizing the base-ization and factory-ization of iron and steel production.

Native furnace iron smelting in Xinhua County had already blossomed everywhere in June and July. The prominent problems encountered after the native furnaces were put into production were resource imbalances and a lack of labor. The county party committee promptly decided to establish iron and steel bases, and in accordance with the spirit of communist cooperation, broke down the boundaries of townships and communes, and carried out a large-scale mobilization of the county's labor force to jointly develop the county's resources. Based on the data from the masses and the exploration team on mineral deposits, as well as labor and natural regional conditions, it was decided to establish twelve iron and steel production cooperation zones to carry out joint mining, coal mining, and smelting operations. At the same time, the native furnaces were consolidated. The iron smelting sites with more iron and coal reserves and more convenient transportation were uniformly included in the scope of the iron and steel base management. The furnaces in other areas lacking iron or coal, or lacking iron but having coal, were eliminated. The equipment was removed and moved to the iron and steel base for reinstallation. After the consolidation, the preserved and newly built furnaces were basically located near the sites producing coal and iron ore. This also provided a number of backup furnaces for rotation and repair.

During the mass movement to build iron and steel bases, the county and commune party committees mainly focused on three links: First, selecting and determining excellent furnace types, vigorously carrying out technical reforms of native furnaces, and rushing to manufacture equipment and materials. The county adopted the method of converting small furnaces to large ones and increasing the height of short furnaces, and rebuilt and built more than 2,000 native-foreign combined furnaces of one to five tons, nine five-ton small blast furnaces, and two twenty-five-ton small blast furnaces. The county also transferred more than 1,600 carpenters to make blowers, and in more than 50 days, they made 3,000 wooden centrifugal blowers and foot-operated blowers. In addition to equipping some boiler locomotives, gas engines, and diesel engines, the use of hydraulic blowers was also vigorously promoted. The Wenjiaqiao branch factory of the Heqing Commune relied on its own efforts, using oil-soaked cloth strips as transmission belts and tung oil plus soap solution as lubricating oil, to achieve hydraulic blowing, and the daily output per furnace jumped from 0.3 tons to 3 tons.

Second, establishing "satellite factories" to serve the iron and steel base. Each iron and steel base established its own twelve briquette manufacturing plants, fifteen woodworking plants, fifty-seven ironware processing workshops, and three coking plants. The county also established one machinery factory, one coking plant, and one briquette factory. After completing the production task of blowers, the county agricultural machinery factory manufactured 800 earth trains (mine cars) and is currently preparing to produce equipment such as gas engines.

Third, establishing a transportation network extending in all directions from mines to factories and from bases to all parts of the county. The county newly built more than 1,500 kilometers of simple roads, which are connected to the Zi River, which runs through Xinhua. At present, eleven bases can be reached by car. The county also built three wooden rail earth train lines with a total length of 60 li for transporting coal and ore. The double-track earth train line from Jinzhushan to Shatangwan is as long as 13 li and was built and opened to traffic in just seven days and nights, increasing transportation efficiency by 20 times. Next year, we will vigorously build thermal power and hydropower stations.

The iron and steel bases are producing while being built, and the output is often stable at a high level. By November 20, the county had produced more than 84,000 tons of iron and 5,800 tons of native steel, greatly exceeding the original plan. (Attached picture)

    新化县钢铁基地初步形成
    本报长沙1日电  湖南省新化县在整编原有土炼铁炼钢炉的基础上，经过定点、定组、定型、定员、定领导的“五定”工作，建立了十二个钢铁基地，实现了钢铁生产基地化、工厂化。
    新化县土炉炼铁在6、7月间就已遍地开花。土炉投入生产后遇到的突出问题是资源不平衡和劳动力缺乏。县委及时决定建立钢铁基地，按照共产主义协作精神，打破乡社界限，对全县劳动力实行大调动，协力开发全县资源。根据群众和勘探队对矿藏的勘察资料，以及劳动力和自然区域等情况，确定建立十二个钢铁生产协作区，进行采矿、挖煤、冶炼的联合经营。同时对土炉进行整编，将铁煤储量较多、运输较便利的炼铁现场，统一纳入钢铁基地管辖范围，其他无铁无煤或有煤缺铁地区的炉子就淘汰，把设备取下来，搬到钢铁基地去重新安装。整编以后，保存和新建的炉子基本上做到了靠近产煤产矿砂的现场。这样也有了一批轮换检修的后备炉。
    在群众性的建设钢铁基地的运动中，县、社党委主要抓了三个环节：第一，选择、确定优良炉型，大搞土炉技术改革，赶制设备和器材。全县采取小炉改大、矮炉加高的办法，共改建和新建了一至五吨的土洋结合炉二千多座，五吨小高炉九座，二十五吨小高炉两座。全县还抽调了一千六百多名木匠大制鼓风机，五十多天就制成木质离心式鼓风机和脚踏鼓风机三千台。鼓风动力除装备一部分锅驼机、煤气机、柴油机外，还大力推广了水力鼓风。禾青公社文家桥分厂自力更生，用浸油的布条做传动带，用桐油加肥皂液做润滑油，实现了水力鼓风化，每炉日产量由零点三吨飞跃到三吨。
    第二，建立为钢铁基地服务的“卫星厂”。各钢铁基地自己建立了十二个煤球制造厂、十五个木工厂、五十七个铁器加工车间和三个炼焦厂。县里还建立了机械厂、炼焦厂、煤球厂各一个。县农具机械厂完成鼓风机生产任务以后，制造了八百台土火车（矿车），目前正准备生产煤气机等设备。
    第三，从矿山到工厂，从基地到全县各地，建立四通八达的交通运输网。全县新修简易公路一千五百多公里，和贯通新化的资水相接。目前，已有十一个基地可以通汽车。全县还修建了三条全长六十华里的木轨土火车道，运煤运矿砂。金竹山至沙塘湾的双轨土火车道长达十三华里，仅七昼夜就修成通车，运输效率提高二十倍。明年还要大力兴建火力、水力发电站。
    钢铁基地边建设边生产，产量经常稳定在高产水平。到11月20日，全县已产生铁八万四千多吨，土钢五千八百吨，大大超过原订计划。（附图片）
