Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: News from Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi personally held talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Douglas MacArthur II, on the 7th regarding the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This shows that although Kishi Nobusuke and the United States' plot to revise the "Security Treaty" into a more aggressive bilateral military treaty has suffered a heavy blow under the strong opposition of the Japanese people, Kishi Nobusuke has not given up his plan to complete the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as soon as possible.

According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," Kishi Nobusuke has reached some kind of conclusion on the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" during the two and a half hour secret talks with MacArthur II.

The Japan-U.S. negotiations were originally conducted between Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and MacArthur II. They were originally scheduled to hold the third formal negotiation this week, but due to the increasing internal strife within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and Kishi Nobusuke's activities to "adjust" this strife repeatedly failed, Fujiyama had to announce another temporary postponement on the grounds that the U.S. Ambassador was going on a "trip." Today, Fujiyama said that he would meet with the U.S. side this weekend.

Fujiyama went to Kanagawa Prefecture today to find former Japanese Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic Party advisor Shigeru Yoshida, hoping that he would support Nobusuke Kishi's plot to step up the negotiation to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Although Yoshida believed that "Japan needs to take a clearer attitude towards communism"; he said that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should be carried out "leisurely."

At present, the trend within the Liberal Democratic Party against Nobusuke Kishi is increasing. The core figures of the "anti-mainstream faction" including the Hayato Ikeda faction, the Tanzan Ishibashi faction, the Kōjirō Ishii faction and the Kenzo Matsumura - Takeo Miki faction, such as Kōichi Seko, Hideo Shuto, and Masanobu Tsuji, held a meeting in Tokyo today, deciding to oppose the early re-election of the party president, oppose the adoption of crude and tyrannical working methods for party work, and advocate that there should be "unified opinions" among the various factions on important policies such as the preparation of the next fiscal year's budget and the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the same time, the leaders of the four "anti-mainstream" factions, State Minister Hayato Ikeda, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Takeo Miki, as well as Kenzo Matsumura, Namaji Hayashi, Hideji Masutani, Okujirow Okubo, and Kojiro Ishii, also held a meeting today, deciding to strengthen the unity of the four factions and establish an anti-Kishi Nobusuke system.

Under the aggressive situation of the "anti-mainstream faction," Nobusuke Kishi, Finance Minister Eisaku Sato, Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Banboku Ohno, Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima, and Chairman of the General Council Ichiro Kono decided to hold a five-person meeting again on the 9th, intending to "strengthen the unity of the mainstream faction" and "repel the counterattack of the anti-mainstream faction." According to Kyodo News, they insisted on holding a party convention in January next year in order to "re-elect Nobusuke Kishi as president again before the anti-mainstream faction is ready."

    死要修改日美“安全条约”
    岸信介与美大使密谈
    新华社8日讯  东京消息：日本首相岸信介7日亲自和美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二就修改日美“安全条约”问题举行了会谈。这件事说明，岸信介和美国想把“安全条约”修改成为更富有侵略性的双边军事条约的阴谋在日本人民的强烈反对下虽然已经遭到沉重打击，但是，岸信介还没有放弃早日完成修改日美“安全条约”的计划。
    据“东京新闻”透露，岸信介在同麦克阿瑟第二举行的两个半小时的秘密会谈中，已经就修改“安全条约”的谈判的问题得出了某种结论。
    日美谈判原先是在日本外务相藤山爱一郎和麦克阿瑟第二之间进行的。他们原定在这个星期举行第三次正式谈判，但是，由于执政的自由民主党内部的纷争日益严重，岸信介“调整”这种纷争的活动又一再遭到失败，藤山不得不以美国大使要“出外旅行”为理由，再次宣布暂时推迟。今天，藤山又表示要在本周末同美方会谈。
    藤山今天到神奈川县去找了日本前首相、自由民主党顾问吉田茂，希望他支持岸信介加紧进行修改日美“安全条约”谈判的阴谋。吉田虽然认为“日本需要对共产主义采取更加明确的态度”；但是，对修改日美“安全条约”问题，他表示应该“从容地进行”。
    目前，自由民主党内部反对岸信介的趋势有增无已。“反主流派”的池田（勇人）派、石桥（湛山）派、石井（光次郎）派和松村（谦三）——三木（武夫）派等四派的核心人物世耕弘一、周东英雄、辻政信等二十人，今天在东京举行了会议，决定反对提前改选党的总裁，反对采取土豪恶霸式的工作方法进行党的工作，并且主张在编制下一财政年度预算和修改日美“安全条约”等重要政策的问题上要有各派的“统一意见”。同时，“反主流派”的四个派系的首脑人物国务相池田勇人、经济企划厅长官三木武夫以及松村谦三、林浪治、益谷秀次、大久保留次郎、石井光次郎等七人也在今天举行了会议，决定要加强四派的团结，建立反岸信介体制。
    在“反主流派”这种咄咄逼人的情势下，岸信介、大藏相佐藤荣作、自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦、干事长川岛正次郎、总务会长河野一郎等决定在9日再次举行五人会谈，打算“加强主流派的团结”、“打退反主流派的反击”。据共同社说，他们坚持要在明年1月举行党的大会，以便“在反主流派还没有作好准备的时候，再次选举岸信介做总裁”。
