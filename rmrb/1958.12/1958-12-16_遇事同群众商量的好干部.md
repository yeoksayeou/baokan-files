A Good Cadre Who Consults the Masses on Everything
By our reporter Li Huanchao

	After returning from the steel smelting construction site in the deep autumn, Li Dingzhong was given the task by his leaders to harvest over 4,800 mu of late rice within four days.

	Li Dingzhong is the battalion commander of the Wenxing Production Battalion of the Red Star People's Commune in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, a twenty-four-year-old Communist Party member. Although the task of harvesting late rice was arduous, it did not overwhelm him, as he had already mastered a magic weapon: as long as you consult with the masses on everything, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. However, the task was indeed very challenging. Of the more than 2,300 laborers in the battalion, more than 1,200 had already been transferred to build railways and smelt steel. With fewer people and a heavy task, what could be done to complete the mission?

	After discussing with the company and platoon cadres, Li Dingzhong decided to hold battlefield meetings for poor peasants and key members by company or platoon. At the battlefield meetings in each company, they calculated the time and labor needed after harvesting the late rice for planting rapeseed and wheat, digging autumn sweet potatoes, and carrying out deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation. Everyone also discussed whether the late rice should be harvested in a concentrated rush and whether it could be done in a concentrated rush. The poor peasants and key members all believed that those who lacked confidence were suffering from the thought of being afraid of hardship. A poor peasant commune member from Langsi Company said: In the old society, we had no rice to cook in lean years and tearfully harvested the grain to pay rent to the landlords. Now it is all our own, and we must not let the grain we have earned with our sweat rot in the fields. Poor peasants and key members from Wenxing, Langsi, and other companies also proposed to allocate the labor force well, assign tasks specifically to each "bantu" (a tool for carrying rice), and adopt the method of camping in the fields, dividing areas and assigning responsibilities by company. The battalion headquarters would provide unified command, overall arrangements, and full cooperation. The battalion headquarters promptly promoted this method. Each production company understood the strength of the labor force, and the confidence of the commune members also increased. Commune members from Langsi, Huafeng, and other companies proposed to complete the task in three days, and a high tide of rushing to harvest soon began throughout the battalion. The full and semi-laborers in Changling, Langsi, and other companies achieved a high efficiency of harvesting an average of 1.5 mu per person per day. On the second day of the rush harvest, black clouds gathered in the sky after lunch. At that time, Li Dingzhong was returning from inspecting work at Taiping Company and, passing the Langsi River, saw that some commune members in Langsi Company on the opposite bank had stopped using their "bantu." He really wanted to shout to the commune members: Comrades, we must harvest even if it rains. But the words came to his throat and then he stopped. He thought: I don't want the commune members to get wet in the rain, so he rolled up his trousers and crossed the Langsi River, and asked the commune members to go home and get rain capes and hats. Big drops of rain began to fall, and he took off his cotton coat to help the second platoon leader finish carrying the last few bundles of rice. When the commune members saw their battalion commander carrying rice in the rain, no one was willing to go home to get rain gear, and everyone carried, cut, and hoed. Everyone's heart was warm, and the cheers and shouts, the sound of cutting rice and carrying rice, drowned out the howling of the wind and rain. It wasn't until the cooks from the public canteen brought dinner that everyone stopped their sickles and "bantu," wiped the sweat from their soaked bodies, and ate dinner under the grass shed in the fields. While they were eating, they asked the battalion commander and company commander to work through the night in the rain. Several commune members who finished eating first ran back to the company headquarters without saying a word and brought horse lanterns to the fields. After dinner, the commune members fought again under the lights in the wind and rain. Li Dingzhong was deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the commune members racing against the rain. But he was very worried that the commune members would catch a cold, and resolutely refused to let the commune members work at night. He mobilized the commune members to go back everywhere, but no commune member was willing to go home. In the end, Li Dingzhong had to order everyone to go home to rest, and everyone reluctantly stopped working. The next day the weather cleared up, and the commune members all worked very happily. With the concerted efforts of the commune members, the late rice of the whole battalion was successfully harvested in four days, and the grains of late rice returned home. The commune members said with emotion: The Communist Party really does what it says.

	After the late rice was harvested, Li Dingzhong and the commune members took advantage of the victory to rush to plant rapeseed and wheat, and vigorously carry out deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation. However, there were only a hundred or so commune members left who could plow the fields, and more than half of the battalion's 300 cattle had no one to use. Li Dingzhong thought: When harvesting late rice, the enthusiasm of the women was no less than that of the men. If they learn to plow the fields, the task of rapeseed and wheat can be doubled and still catch up with the season. So he discussed the issue of mobilizing young women to learn to plow the fields with the cadres of the battalion. Xie Yueying, the female company commander of Wenxing Company, quickly mobilized eight young women to learn to plow the fields. The next day, they followed the male commune members who plowed the fields to learn and plow in the fields, and basically learned it after a day of hard work. When the good news reached other companies, the young women all scrambled to sign up to learn to plow the fields. In a few days, the battalion had added more than 100 new forces for plowing the fields, and all the cattle in the battalion were also put to work. More than 1,100 mu of wheat and more than 4,700 mu of rapeseed were all sown in time. In addition, 2,800 mu of winter-irrigated fields were not only deeply plowed, but also dug with ten "tangzi" (ponds) per mu, and filled with miscellaneous fertilizer and manure.

	While the commune members were working hard to increase production, Li Dingzhong paid more attention to the lives of the commune members. When he heard that some commune members were reporting that the food in some public canteens was not good enough, he went to that canteen to eat every day, using the time before and after meals to discuss improving the food with the cooks. When the cooks saw that the battalion commander was so concerned about their work, in addition to seriously cooking the food well, they also grew their own vegetables and raised chickens to improve the quality of the dishes. When the commune members saw that the food was better than before, they also loved the public canteen. The house of the canteen was dilapidated, and the commune members who could do carpentry and masonry automatically used their rest time to repair it. The walls were dark, and the commune members who had lime at home donated lime to whitewash the walls. After that, the food quality of all 43 canteens in the battalion was greatly improved. In the past, the third canteen of Wenxing Company, which was called a third-class canteen by the commune members, now the commune members can eat two small dishes for each meal.

    遇事同群众商量的好干部
    本报记者  李焕超
    深秋，李定中从炼铁工地回来后，领导上便交给他在四天之内把四千八百多亩田的晚稻抢回来的任务。
    李定中是湖南省湘乡县红星人民公社文星生产营的营长，一个二十四岁的共产党员。抢收晚稻的任务虽然繁重，但没有压倒他，他已经掌握了一套法宝：凡事只要和群众商量，天大的困难也能克服。但是，任务的确很艰巨。营里二千三百多名劳动力，已经调出一千二百多名去修铁路、炼钢铁去了。人手少，任务重想什么办法才能完成任务呢？
    李定中和连排干部商量后，决定以连或排为单位召开贫农和骨干分子的战地会议。各连在战地会上，算了抢收晚稻后，要抢种油菜、小麦、挖秋红薯、搞深耕积肥的时间和劳动力账，大家还讨论了晚稻要不要突击抢收能不能突击抢收？贫农和骨干分子都认为那些信心不足的人，是怕吃苦的思想作怪。浪丝连的一个贫农社员说：在旧社会，歉收年头我们没有米下锅，含着眼泪将谷子收回来向地主交地租。现在都是我们自己的，我们决不能让自己汗水换来的粮食烂在田里。文星、浪丝等连的贫农和骨干分子还提出了把劳动力搭配好，任务具体分配到每个扮桶，以连为单位采取田间扎营，分片包干的办法。营部统一指挥，全面安排，通力协作。营部及时推广这一办法，各个生产连摸清了劳动力底子，社员的信心也大了。浪丝、华丰等连的社员提出了三天要完成任务，全营很快掀起抢收高潮。长岭、浪丝等连的整、半劳动力，达到了平均每人一天抢收一点五亩的高工效。抢收的第二天，吃过午饭的时候天空黑云四起，那时李定中从太平连检查工作回来，经过浪丝河，看到对岸的浪丝连有的社员把扮桶停下来，他真想大声对社员说：同志们，下雨也要抢收。可是话到喉头又收回去了。心里想：不要社员给雨淋坏了，于是卷起脚过了浪丝河，叫社员回家拿蓑衣斗笠。大点大点的雨落下来了，他脱掉身上的棉衣，帮二排长扮完最后几把稻子。社员们看到自己的营长冒雨扮禾，谁也不肯回家拿蓑衣雨具，大家又扮的扮、割的割，个个的心里热呼呼的，欢呼的吆喝声，割禾扮禾声，掩盖了风雨的呼啸声。直到傍晚公共食堂的炊事员送来了晚饭，大家才停下镰刀、扮桶，擦一擦满身湿透的汗水，就在田边的草棚下吃起晚饭来。他们一边吃，一边向营长、连长要求冒雨干个通宵。有几个先吃完饭的社员，一声不响地跑回连部，把马灯拿到田里来了。吃完饭，社员们又在风雨的灯光下战斗起来了，李定中也被社员们与雨点赛跑的干劲深深感动。但是他很担心社员们受凉，坚决不让社员开夜工，他到处动员社员回去，而社员谁也不愿回家。最后李定中只好下命令要大家回家休息，大家才勉强收工。第二天天气转晴，社员们个个干得顶欢。全营的晚稻在社员们齐心协力的抢收下，四天胜利地完成任务，晚稻颗粒还家了。社员们感慨地说：共产党办事情真是说到做到。
    晚稻扮收回来之后，李定中又和社员们一道乘胜抢种油菜、小麦，大搞深耕积肥。可是能够犁田的社员只剩下一百多个人，营里三百多头耕牛，有半数以上没有人使。李定中心里想：收晚稻时妇女的干劲不比男的差，如果她们学会犁田，油菜、小麦的任务再加一倍也能赶上季节。于是他和营里的干部商量发动青年妇女学犁田的问题。文星连女连长谢月英很快就动员了八个年青妇女学犁田。第二天她们跟着犁田的男社员到田里边学边犁，苦学了一天就基本上学会了。这一喜讯传到其他连，年青的妇女都争着报名学习犁田。几天时间，全营就增加了一百多个犁田的生力军，营里的耕牛也全部出工了。一千一百多亩小麦和四千七百多亩油菜，都及时播种了。另外有二千八百亩浸冬田，不但深耕了，而且每亩打了十方的氹子，沤上了杂肥和粪。
    在社员发狠闹生产的同时，李定中更加注意社员的生活。当他听到社员反映有的公共食堂菜饭不够好时，他就每天跑到那个食堂去吃，利用吃饭的前后时间和炊事员研究改进伙食问题。炊事员看到营长这样关心自己的工作，他们除了认真把菜饭做好之外，还自己种了蔬菜，养了鸡子，提高菜的质量。社员们看到菜饭比过去好了，他们也热爱公共食堂了。食堂的房子破烂，会做木匠和砌匠的社员自动地利用休息时间把它修整好。墙壁乌黑，家里有石灰的社员就献出石灰把墙粉刷得雪白。这以后，全营四十三个食堂伙食质量也大大提高了。以前，社员叫做三类食堂的文星连第三食堂，现在社员每餐能吃到两个小菜。
