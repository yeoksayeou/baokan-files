A twenty-year-old Yi girl attended the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Congress. People who know her story are very moved and call her a good Yi girl.

Her hometown, Bai Ni Township in Shuicheng, Guizhou, is full of towering mountains and ridges. The high mountains and dry land make it difficult for many crops to grow in the fields. It is a notorious "poor and remote area" where "no three li are level, and no one has three fen of silver." Before liberation, her family worked from dawn till dusk, planting a few rain-fed fields year-round. In the event of drought, they couldn't even recover the seeds. Her father died after falling from a rock while working for the landlord because he couldn't pay the rent, leaving behind his mother, daughter, and young brother, destitute and helpless. They endured such hardships until liberation, when they finally saw the sun.

In order to completely change the face of the mountainous area, the Party branch decided to build a reservoir in the Guanyin Mountain Valley with a capacity of 800,000 cubic meters of water. This project was extremely arduous, requiring splitting a large stone mountain and blasting millions of cubic meters of rock to build a dam. In February of this year, He Xianzhen was the first to respond to the Party's call. In the midst of heavy snow, she led thirty-seven women to join the mountain-splitting commando team, and together with other laborers, they entered the Guanyin Mountain Valley. They built work sheds in the sparsely populated wilderness and began construction of the reservoir. When they first arrived, they saw several feet of snow and icicles hanging from the cliffs, which made many people a little daunted. He Xianzhen thought that if people don't go up the stone mountain, the stone mountain will always be a stone mountain, and the stone mountain will not turn into a reservoir by itself. She said to the women, "We are not discouraged by failure, only success will satisfy us." After speaking, she took the lead to climb the stone mountain, tied a thick rope around her waist, and clinging to the cliff with both hands, she hung on the cliff to drill blasting holes. He Xianzhen's hair often froze into icicles as thick as chopsticks, her clothes froze into ice shells, and her face and hands were chapped. When others told her to come down and rest, she said, "The cold wind can chill my body, but my heart is always warm. The more hardship we endure here today, the more happiness we create for the people."

He Xianzhen's tenacious will moved the laborers on the construction site. Many people proposed: if He Xianzhen can climb the stone mountain, we can also climb it. Therefore, everyone signed up to go to "Tiger Mountain" to be "Tiger Generals," and learn He Xianzhen's fighting spirit of not fearing hardship and danger. In splitting the mountain and drilling blasting holes, the members of the women's commando team played a highly effective role. In order to improve work efficiency, He Xianzhen and other comrades carried out technological innovations, and in a few short days, they created nine advanced tools, including an aerial stone transporter, a stone-cutting machine, a foot-operated rammer, and a dam press. The aerial stone transporter alone saved more than 3,500 laborers a day. In this way, in less than a few months, a large stone mountain was quickly split open. Their commando team completed the main mountain-splitting project. The leading comrades of the CPC Shuicheng County Committee personally went to the construction site to provide guidance, which further boosted everyone's enthusiasm. He Xianzhen resolutely stated: "If water doesn't enter the fields, people won't go home." During the five-month blitz, He Xianzhen received praise and rewards from the Party and the construction site headquarters several times. She became even more humble and proactive, getting up early every day and leading the entire commando team in splitting mountains and building dams.

One night, He Xianzhen was walking back to the construction site camp from the dam. Seeing that the reservoir was about to be completed, and that more than 4,500 mu of dry land would soon be transformed into bright and shining paddy fields, she happily sang a mountain song in her heart:

Thousands of miles of cliffs are split into ditches,
Ten thousand miles of rock feet, water flows backwards,
Do everything possible to build water conservancy,
So that future generations will not suffer.

In the middle of the night, she had just fallen asleep when a rainstorm came. Later, the rain fell harder and harder, and the wind blew more and more violently. The work sheds were torn apart by the strong wind, the dormitories were filled with water, and even the cooking pots were filled with mud and sand. At this time, she suddenly heard a landslide in the valley, and the construction site headquarters issued an emergency order to assemble to protect the dam. He Xianzhen kicked open the quilt, quickly put on her clothes, and rushed to the dam. She was knocked down several times by the rainstorm as soon as she left the work shed. Mountain torrents flowed everywhere, and the work shed became a river, and the bedding was washed away by the water. He Xianzhen couldn't bother to salvage her luggage from the flood, struggling to climb up from the flood and continuing to rush forward. Once on the dam, the reservoir had become a vast ocean. The people protecting the dam rushed to dig several spillways and flood intercepting ditches, but they couldn't stop the raging mountain torrents. The flood continued to surge over the top of the dam, and the road to the gate was also washed away by the flood. The gate was still tightly closed, and the safety chain for opening the gate was tightly fastened to a rock. If people couldn't get down and the gate couldn't be opened, the flood couldn't be discharged. The people on the dam were extremely nervous, watching as the dam foundation was about to collapse. At this time, she suddenly saw the chain on the rock, her heart pounding. In front of her was a dark and vast ocean, and the mountain torrents were raging like wild horses running loose. A moment of carelessness could cause people to be swept into the flood. But when she thought of the seedlings in the fields and the people in the village who were urgently waiting for water to irrigate the fields, she didn't care about anything and rushed up. With a leap, she jumped down from the thorny bushes on the several-zhang-high cliff. When she landed next to the chain, the rocks cut her legs like sharp blades, and her face was also cut with cracks by the thorns, dripping with blood, and her clothes were torn into pieces. At first, she tried hard to pull the chain, but she couldn't open it, and she was as anxious as if she were on fire. Finally, she used all her strength, stomped on the rock, and with a violent force, the gate opened, and the flood quickly rushed out of the gate. When the people protecting the dam rushed over, He Xianzhen had passed out from exhaustion, still holding the chain with both hands.

    彝族的好姑娘
    格来
    在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会上，有一个二十岁的彝族姑娘。知道她事迹的人都很受感动，都称她是彝族的好姑娘。
    她的家乡——贵州水城白腻乡，到处是崇山峻岭，山高地旱，田里很多庄稼都长不好，有名的“地无三里平，人无三分银”的“穷乡僻壤”。解放前，她的一家人一年到头，顶星星，戴月亮，种着几块望天水田，遇到天旱，连种籽都收不回来。她的父亲因交不上田租，给地主扛活，从石岩上摔死了，留下母女幼弟，无依无靠，经常受冻挨饿，这样的苦日子一直熬到解放，她们才见着了太阳。
    为了彻底改变山区的面貌，党支部决定在观音山峡谷修筑一座可容纳八十万立方水量的蓄水库。这个工程非常艰巨，要劈开一座大石山，炸掉上百万的石方，才能筑起拦水大坝。今年2月间，何献珍第一个响应党的号召，在大雪纷飞的季节里，她带动了三十七个妇女参加了劈山的突击队，和其他民工一道，开进了观音山峡谷，在人迹稀少的荒山里，搭起了工棚，开始动工修筑水库。她们初到那里，看到积雪数尺，冰柱挂在悬岩上，许多人都有点胆怯。何献珍想，如果人不上石山，石山永远是石山，石山自己不会变成水库。她向妇女们说：“我们失败不灰心，成功才甘心”。说完，便带头上石山，腰间束了一根粗绳子，两手攀着峭壁，吊在崖上打炮眼。何献珍的头发经常冻结成像筷子一样粗的冰棒，衣服冻成了冰壳，脸和手冻裂了，别人叫她下来休息，她说：“寒风能吹冷我的身体，但我的心永远是热的，我们今天在这里多吃点苦，就是给人民多创造点幸福。”
    何献珍的顽强意志感动了工地上的民工们，许多人提出：何献珍能上石山，我们也能上，于是个个报名要求上“虎山”做“虎将”，学习何献珍不畏惧艰险的战斗精神。在劈山打炮眼中，妇女突击队的队员们发挥了高度地突击作用。何献珍为了提高工效，她和别的同志一道进行技术革新，在短短的几天中，创造出了空中运石机、打石机、脚踏打夯机和压坝等九种先进工具。其中光空中运石机一项，一天就能节约三千五百多个劳动力。这样不到几个月的时间，一座大石山很快被劈开了。她们这支突击队完成了主要的劈山工程。中共水城县委的领导同志亲自到工地进行指导，更鼓舞了大家的干劲。何献珍坚决表示：“水若不入田，人就不回家。”在五个月的突击中，何献珍几次受到了党和工地指挥部的表扬和奖励。她愈加虚心积极，每天很早爬起来，带领着整个突击队员劈山筑坝。
    有天夜里，何献珍从水坝上走回工地宿营地，看到水库快要建成，四千五百多亩旱地，转眼就要变成明光光的水田，她心里乐滋滋地唱起山歌：
    千里悬岩劈成沟，
    万里岩脚水倒流，
    千方百计修水利，
    子子孙孙不受苦。
    半夜里，她刚刚入睡，就来了暴风雨，后来雨越下越大，风越吹越猛，工棚被狂风吹得四分五裂，宿舍里到处水汪汪的，连煮饭的锅里也填满了泥沙。这时她突然听到山谷里传来了一阵山崩地裂的声音，工地指挥部发出紧急护坝的集合命令。何献珍一脚蹬开被子急忙披上衣服，向水坝冲上去。她刚出工棚，就被暴风雨吹倒了几次。山洪到处奔流，工棚内也成了河流，铺盖被水卷走了。何献珍顾不上从洪水里打捞行李，挣扎着从洪水里爬起来，继续冲上前去。一到坝上，水库已成了一片汪洋大海。护坝的人们抢挖了几条溢洪道和拦洪沟，但怎么也挡不住汹涌的山洪。洪水继续在坝顶上翻腾着，通往闸门的道路也被洪水冲断了。闸门仍然紧闭着，开闸门的保险链索紧拴在一处石岩上。人下不去，闸门拉不开，洪水就没法排出。坝上的人们紧张极了，眼看着坝基就要冲垮了。这时她突然看见了岩上的链索，心里怦怦地跳着，面前黑茫茫的一片汪洋，山洪像脱缰的万马在奔腾着，一不留神洪水会把人卷入洪峰里。但她一想到田里的禾苗，乡里的人们正急待着水去灌田，就什么也不顾，飞奔上去，一个纵身，从几丈高悬崖的荆刺丛中跳下去。当她扑到链索旁边时，岩石像锋利的刀刃一样割裂了她的腿，脸上也被荆刺刺开了一道道的裂缝，鲜血淋淋，身上的衣服都撕成了碎块。她起初使劲拉着链索，但怎么也拉不开，心里急得像火烧一样。最后，她使尽全身的力气，脚蹬着石岩猛一使劲，闸门拉开了，洪水很快从闸门冲出去。当护坝的人们赶来时，何献珍精疲力竭地昏迷过去了，双手还拉着链索。
