In the future communist society, I believe that physical labor will disappear, and everyone will only need to engage in mental labor (but this is not "pure" mental labor as Wei Gao said, but only because physical labor is no longer needed at that time); although there will still be a division of labor in society, there will be no division of physical and mental labor.

Physical labor is a sign of backward production technology. Communism is a society with highly developed production technology. At that time, physical labor can be completely replaced by machines, and physical labor will completely disappear. Everyone will become mental laborers.

Physical labor is a sign of backward production technology. In human history, there was a period when there were only physical laborers and no mental laborers, that is, the primitive communist society. At that time, people relied only on tools such as wooden sticks and stones to obtain very little living materials that could barely prevent starvation, so everyone had to engage in physical labor. Later, with the application of ironware in production, mankind entered slave society. Due to the improvement of production technology, people had surplus living materials and more free time for work, and some spiritual life requirements arose. In addition, production experience needed to be summarized, and cultural workers engaged in mental labor appeared. At this time, the phenomenon of class opposition also occurred. The ruling class engaged in mental labor, so physical labor was gradually despised. It can be seen that physical labor is only available when production technology is backward, and the separation of physical labor and mental labor is caused by class opposition.

The history of social production technology development proves that every new technology applied in production and the improvement of production technology can reduce people's physical labor. Marx said this when talking about the role of machines: "Machines have the wonderful power to reduce human labor and make human labor play a greater effect." (Quoted from "Selected Essays on Planned Economy", Fourth Collection, page 195) We can also find proof in our real life. When Comrade Shaoqi inspected work in Baoding, he said that he saw a stone crushing machine in a factory, which replaced the physical labor of five hundred people knocking on stones in one day. Therefore, the higher the production technology, the less physical labor people have. As everyone knows, communism is a society with highly developed production technology. At that time, people's physical labor can be completely replaced by machines, and even some mental labor can be replaced by machines (electronic computers). Some automated factories in the Soviet Union are the pioneers of the new technological foundation of communism. The workers in these factories do not need to engage in physical labor at all, and can carry out production by simply pressing a button. This shows that in communist society, people's physical labor will completely disappear, and everyone will become mental laborers. Some people say with sophistry that no matter how advanced the society develops, no matter how mechanized, electrified, and automated it is, physical labor is always in a decisive position: even if all labor is just operating by pressing buttons, it must be done by hand, not by brain. This statement is incorrect. What is the basis for saying that no matter how advanced the society develops, physical labor is always in a decisive position? Do people prefer to abandon machines and engage in heavy physical labor? Besides, it is even more ridiculous to say that pressing a button with your hand is physical labor. For example, if a scientist today uses his hand to do experiments, or a writer uses his hand to write a book, is that considered physical labor? Of course not.

In the future communist society, social division of labor will still exist. Some people need to engage in the production of material resources, and some people engage in the production of spiritual life (scientific research, literature and art, etc.). Their labor is necessary labor for society, but the division of labor between them is not the division of physical labor and mental labor, because those who engage in the production of material resources also use machines to replace physical labor. And it should be pointed out that at that time, the necessary labor time spent by mankind to solve the necessities of survival such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation will account for a very small proportion of the entire labor, and more time and more labor will be used to study science, conquer nature, and explore the secrets of the world. In such a situation, although, as mentioned earlier, everyone is a mental laborer, some of these people surpass ordinary people in certain specialized knowledge. Although these people cannot be said to be "geniuses", they are ultimately different from ordinary people.

Eliminating the major differences between physical and mental labor does not lie in having college students with a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge engage in labor unrelated to their own profession, but in improving the scientific and cultural knowledge of workers and peasants.

Here, I would also like to talk about the issue of eliminating the major differences between physical and mental labor. I believe that today's young students participating in labor production and part-work, part-study play a major role in changing the erroneous view that people have despised physical labor for thousands of years and cultivating a labor reserve force that combines theory and practice, but the statement that this is the basic way to gradually eliminate the differences between mental and physical labor is worth considering. Because, as we said earlier, physical labor is a sign of backward production technology, and the phenomenon of separation of physical labor and mental labor occurred after the society produced class opposition. Therefore, as long as production technology is improved, highly automated machines can eliminate physical labor; as is well known, communist society is also a society that has eliminated classes, and of course the phenomenon of separation of physical labor and mental labor will also be eliminated. My view is that eliminating the major differences between physical and mental labor does not lie in having college students with a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge engage in labor unrelated to their own profession, but in improving the scientific and cultural knowledge of workers and peasants, that is, it should not be high moving towards low, but low should cater to high. In communist society, "the increasing technological progress in industry and agriculture, such as electrification, comprehensive mechanization, and chemicalization, requires production workers to have a high level of general education and specialized engineering and technical education or agronomic education." "The way to eliminate the major differences between physical and mental labor is to raise the cultural and technical level of workers to the level of engineering and technical personnel, and to raise the cultural and technical level of peasants to the level of agronomists."

("Textbook of Political Economy", Volume II, pages 635, 636). And the ever-decreasing working hours of workers and peasants in the future will ensure that workers and peasants "have the opportunity to devote more time and energy to mastering knowledge and culture, and to harmoniously develop all their physical and intellectual powers." (Ibid.)

### 将来人人都是脑力劳动者

    将来人人都是脑力劳动者
    人韦
    在未来的共产主义社会中，我认为，体力劳动会消失，人人都只需要从事脑力劳动（但这不是如魏高所说的“单纯的”脑力劳动者，而只是因为那时已不需要体力劳动）；社会虽仍存在着职务的分工，但不存在体力劳动与脑力劳动的分工。
    体力劳动是生产技术落后的标志，共产主义是生产技术高度发展了的社会，那时体力劳动完全可由机器来代替，体力劳动就完全消失了，人人都成为脑力劳动者
    体力劳动是生产技术落后的标志。在人类历史上，曾经出现过一个只有体力劳动者而没有脑力劳动者的时期，那就是原始共产社会。在当时，人们仅仅依靠木棍、石块等工具，取得极少的仅能不饿死的生活资料，所以人人必须从事体力劳动。以后随着铁器在生产中的应用，人类进入奴隶社会后，由于生产技术的提高，人们已有剩余的生活资料，同时也有较多的工作余暇时间，产生了一些精神生活的要求，再加上生产经验需要总结，这就出现了从事脑力劳动的文化工作者。在这个时候，阶级的对立现象也产生了，统治阶级都从事脑力劳动，因此体力劳动才逐步受到轻视。由此可见，生产技术落后才有体力劳动，而体力劳动与脑力劳动的分离是由于阶级的对立而产生的。
    社会的生产技术发展史证明，每一项新的技术在生产中的应用，生产技术的提高，都能减轻人们的体力劳动。马克思在谈到机器的作用时曾这样说：“机器有减少人类劳动和使人类劳动发挥更大效果的绝妙力量。”（转引自“计划经济论文选”，第四辑，第195页）在我们的现实生活中，也可以找到证明。少奇同志在保定视察工作时，曾说他在一个工厂里看见一部碎矿石机，工作一天就代替了五百个人敲矿石的体力劳动。所以生产技术愈提高，人们的体力劳动就愈减少。而大家知道，共产主义是生产技术高度发展了的社会，在那时，人们的体力劳动完全可以由机器来代替，甚至某些脑力劳动也可由机器来代替（电子计算机），苏联的某些自动化工厂，就是共产主义的新的技术基础的先声，这些工厂的工人完全不要从事体力劳动，只要按电钮就能进行生产。由此说明，到共产主义社会，人们的体力劳动就完全消失了，人人都成为脑力劳动者。有一种人，以诡辩的态度说，不论社会发展到如何高级，不论机械化、电气化、自动化到何种程度，体力劳动总是处于决定一切的地位：即使是一切劳动都只是按电钮去操作，也是要用手去按，不能用脑去按。这种说法是不正确的。所谓社会发展到如何高级，体力劳动总是处于决定一切的地位，这有什么根据呢？难道人们宁可抛弃机械而去从事繁重的体力劳动吗？再说，用手按电钮就算体力劳动这更可笑了，比如我们今天一个科学家用手做试验，一个作家用手写书就算体力劳动吗？这当然不对。
    在未来的共产主义社会中，社会分工是仍然存在的，有些人需要从事物质资料的生产，有些人从事精神生活（科学研究、文学艺术等）的生产，他们的劳动都是社会的必要劳动，但他们之间的分工，不是体力劳动与脑力劳动的分工，因为从事物质资料生产的人，也以机器代替了体力劳动。而且应该指出的是，在那时，人类为了解决生存所必需的如衣食住行等所花的必要劳动时间将在整个劳动中占极少的比例，更多的时间更多的劳动是用来研究科学，征服自然，探测世界的秘密。而在这样的情况下，虽然如同前述人人都是脑力劳动者，但这中间有一部分人在某些专门知识方面又超过一般人，这些人虽不能说是“天才”，终究同一般人也有不同之处。
    消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的重大差别，不在于把已有一定科学文化水平的大学生去从事和本身业务无关的劳动，而在于提高工农的科学文化知识
    这里，也附带谈一谈消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动间的重大差别问题。我认为，今天青年学生参加劳动生产，半工半读，这对改变数千年来人们轻视体力劳动的错误看法，培养理论和实际相结合的劳动后备军，是起着重大的作用，但把这作为逐步消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别的基本途径的提法，就值得商榷。因为如同我们前面所说的，体力劳动是生产技术落后的标志，体力劳动与脑力劳动的分离现象是社会产生阶级对立以后发生的。因此只要提高生产技术，高度自动化的机器就能消灭体力劳动；如所周知，共产主义社会也是消灭了阶级的社会，当然体力劳动与脑力劳动的分离现象也会随之消灭。我的看法是：消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动的重大差别，问题不在于把已经有一定科学文化水平的大学生去从事和本身业务无关的劳动，而在于提高工农劳动人民的科学文化知识，也就是说，不是高拉向低，而应该是低去迎合高。在共产主义社会中，“工业和农业中的技术日益进步，如电气化、全盘机械化和化学化等等，愈来愈要求生产工作者有受过普通教育和专门的工程技术教育或农艺教育的高度水平”。“消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动间的重大差别的办法，就是把工人的文化技术水平提高到工程技术人员的水平，把庄员的文化技术水平提高到农艺师的水平。”
    （“政治经济学教科书”，下册，635、636页）。而将来工农劳动者劳动时间的日益缩减，也就保证工农劳动人民“有可能抽出更多的时间和精力来掌握知识和文化，来和谐地发展自己的全部体力和智力。”（同上）
