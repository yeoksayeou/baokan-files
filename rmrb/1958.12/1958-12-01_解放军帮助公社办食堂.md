Xinhua News Agency Report: A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently dispatched thirty mess hall directors, quartermasters, and outstanding cooks to people's communes in their garrison area to help the communes run their public mess halls well. This is a new measure by the PLA to fully support the people's communes. The commanders and fighters said: We will introduce our experience in running mess halls to the people's communes so that the members can eat well and eat their fill.

The PLA has relatively rich experience in running mess halls, especially in how to ensure that everyone eats well under relatively difficult material conditions. Before this unit sent specialists to help the communes run their mess halls, a group of officers who had gone to the communes to study had made remarkable achievements in helping the communes' mess halls. After this group of officers arrived at the communes, according to the local Party committee's instructions to "grasp production with one hand and living standards with the other," they resolved to help the people's communes run their mess halls well and decided that platoon leader Kang Fengji and quartermasters Li Fangshu and Han Xinren would be specifically responsible. They first suggested to the commune that a mess hall management committee be established, accounts be set up, settlements be made in a timely manner, published every half month, and solicit the opinions of the members to implement democratic management of meals. They also helped the commune select mess hall locations in the center of the villages, build dining halls, personally helped carry earth and mud, plaster the walls, and write slogans and poems. The mess hall originally burned more than one catty of coal per person per day on average, which was a great waste. They helped the cooks modify the stoves and taught the cooks how to burn the fire, reducing the daily coal consumption to twelve or thirteen taels. When it got cold, they wove a batch of straw curtains to hang at the entrance of the dining hall and used the fire for cooking to build "underground heating" in the dining hall, so that the members could eat in warm rooms. In order to save food and improve living standards, they helped the mess hall to ration grain according to population and process coarse grains finely. Platoon leader Wang Zefu also made a rice hulling machine for the mess hall based on his hometown experience, so that the members could eat good rice.

The members sat in the warm, clean dining hall, eating meals that suited their tastes, and said with joy that the mess hall was well-run and that our production should be even better.

    解放军帮助公社办食堂
    据新华社讯  中国人民解放军某部最近派出三十名食堂主任、司务长和优秀的炊事兵到驻地人民公社，帮助公社办好公共食堂。这是解放军全力支援人民公社的一个新措施。指战员们说：把我们办食堂的经验介绍给人民公社，使社员吃得好，吃得饱。
    解放军办食堂，有比较丰富的经验，尤其是在物质条件比较困难的情况下，如何使大家吃得好有更丰富的经验。这支部队在派专人帮助公社办食堂以前，曾有一批到公社进行学习的军官，在帮助公社食堂的工作中作出了显著成绩。这批军官到公社以后，根据地方党委“一手抓生产，一手抓生活”的指示，决心帮助人民公社办好食堂，确定由排长康风吉和司务长李芳书、韩信仁具体负责。他们首先向社里建议成立了食堂管理委员会，建立账目，及时结算，每半个月公布一次，征求社员的意见，实行伙食民主管理。他们又帮助社里在村庄中心选择食堂地点，修建饭厅，亲自帮助抬土和泥，粉刷墙壁，写标语、诗歌。这个食堂原来每人每天平均烧煤一斤多，浪费很大，他们就帮助炊事员改炉灶，教炊事员烧火方法，每天烧煤降到十二、三两。天冷了，他们编一批草帘挂在饭厅门口，并在饭厅里利用做饭的火建造了“地下暖气”，使社员在暖屋里吃饭。为了节约粮食和改善生活，他们帮助食堂作到计口下粮、粗粮细作。排长王泽富还根据家乡经验，为食堂制造了一部稻谷脱壳机，使社员吃到了好大米。
    社员们坐在暖和、干净的饭厅里吃着适合口味的饭菜，喜气洋洋地表示食堂办得好，我们的生产要更好。
