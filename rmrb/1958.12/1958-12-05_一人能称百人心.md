    One Person Can Satisfy a Hundred Hearts
    Li Jiusu, Huangsi People's Commune, Xingtai County, Hebei

    In August of this year, our village established a people's commune, and then established a collective canteen. The leaders assigned me to work as a cook. I thought: people are iron, food is steel, and the matter of feeding hundreds of people is very important, so I happily accepted the task.

    But at the beginning, I didn't understand the techniques of cooking, which caused a lot of trouble! The rice I cooked was either too thick or too thin, too much or too little. The soup I made wasn't tasty either, people said: "We're drinking 'staring soup'." I also didn't know how much salt to put in the stir-fried dishes. Sometimes I put too much, and someone would jokingly say: "You must have killed the salt seller." Once, when steaming dry food, I kept cooking it without knowing if it was cooked through, and ended up burning the steamer. Everyone comforted me: "It's inevitable to mess up a meal or two, it will get better later." But I felt very sad. What to do? There was only one way: to learn from experienced people, to take them as teachers. At the same time, we cooks often studied together how to improve cooking and stir-frying techniques; we also frequently solicited opinions from the masses, trying to vary the dishes to make people satisfied. Through constant hard work, we have become quite good at making ordinary, simple meals. Now, the canteen not only changes the menu three times a day, with everything different, but also saved more than a thousand catties of grain in two months. The masses say that the food we make tastes like food from a restaurant. Some old ladies say: "Once it passes through your hands, even bad things can become delicious."

    Some people say: cooking is the most "laborious and thankless" job, because people have different tastes, and "it is difficult for one person to satisfy a hundred hearts." But I think that as long as you solicit more opinions, learn more, and improve more, it is possible to "satisfy a hundred hearts," at least to satisfy the hearts of most people. As for me, I am determined to gradually make everyone eat to their heart's content!

    一人能称百人心
    河北邢台县皇寺人民公社  李九苏
    今年8月，我们村建立了人民公社，接着就建立了集体食堂，领导上分配我担任炊事员工作。我想：人是铁，饭是钢，几百口子人吃饭这件事很重要，我就愉快地接受了这个任务。
    可是开头，我不懂做饭的技术，可遭难咧！做的饭，不是稠就是稀，不是多就是少。做的汤也不好喝，人说：“我们喝的是瞪眼汤。”炒菜也不知放多少盐，有时放多了，有人就诙谐地说：“准是把卖盐的打死了。”有一次蒸干粮，不知生熟一直烧，结果笼屉也烧坏了。大家安慰我：“做坏一顿半顿的短不了，以后就会好的。”可是自己心里很难过。怎么办？道路只有一条：向有经验的人学，拜他们为师。同时，我们炊事员们经常一起研究如何提高做饭、炒菜等技术；还经常征求群众意见，想法多变花样，叫人吃得满意。由于不断苦心钻研，我们对于一般的粗茶淡饭，都做得满好了。现在食堂里不仅做到了一天三变样，样样都不重，而且在两个月内还节省了一千多斤粮。群众说我们做的饭菜像饭馆子里的滋味。有的老大娘说：“一经你们的手，歹东西也能变成好吃的。”
    有人说：炊事工作最是“吃力不讨好”，因为人们口味不同，“一人难称百人心”。但我觉得，只要多征求意见，多学习，多改进，是能做到“称百人心”的，至少能称大多数人的心。我呢，我决心要渐渐做到叫人人都吃得称心如意！
