    How to Keep a Room Warm
    Wu Min
    Everyone knows that to keep a room warm in winter, you can use a stove or install heating pipes. But there is another way, which is to prevent a large amount of cold air from entering the room (proper ventilation is still necessary for people to breathe fresh air and for coal to burn) and to prevent heat from escaping from the walls and window glass to the outside. Some of these methods are very simple, and those who have the means may want to try them.
    In order to prevent a large amount of cold outdoor air from entering the room, it is necessary to block the gaps in the walls and windows and paste them with paper. The north-facing wall, because of the northwest wind, needs more attention.
    As for preventing heat from escaping from the walls and window glass to the outside, it is best to keep a layer of air between the walls, because air conducts heat much less than materials such as soil, wood, and glass. With an air wall, the interior and exterior can be isolated. There are many ways to make an air wall, for example: install a layer of paneling, ceiling, or flooring inside the room. Except for the flooring, seal the gaps in the walls with paper (this way you don't have to worry about the hot sun shining on the roof in summer, and it can also prevent moisture). In cities where wood panels are scarce, you can use small wooden strips to nail to the wall, and then paste thick paper or old newspapers, but do not stick the paper directly on the wall. In rural areas, you can cut rice straw or wheat stalks very short, or mix cow dung and horse manure with an appropriate amount of mud and apply it to the walls. It is best to paste both sides of the windows, leaving a space in the middle. For areas with glass, leave some transparent areas and paste another layer from the inside. Likewise, be careful not to stick the paper directly on the glass. Each region can choose different materials that are both economical and beautiful to make air walls according to this principle.

    怎样使室内暖和
    伍敏
    冬天要使室内暖和，生炉子或装暖气管是大家知道的。但是还有另一个办法，那就是防止室外冷空气的大量进入（适当的通风，使人能呼吸到新鲜空气和使煤炭能够燃烧仍是必要的）和防止室内的热量从墙壁门窗的玻璃传出室外。这种办法有的很简单，有条件的不妨试一试。
    为了防止室外冷空气大量跑入室内，必需将墙壁和窗户的空隙堵住，并用纸糊起来。朝北的墙壁，因为有西北风，更要注意。
    至于防止热量从墙壁门窗的玻璃传出室外，最好是使壁间保留有一层空气，因为空气远比泥土、木头、玻璃等物质传热少，有了空气壁就能使室内室外隔绝起来。做空气壁的办法很多，例如：室内装一层板壁、天花板或地板，除地板外均用纸把壁缝糊起来（这样夏天还可以不怕火热的太阳晒屋顶，还可以防止潮湿。）城市中木板缺乏，可用小木条钉在墙上，然后用厚纸或旧报纸裱起来，但不要把纸贴在墙上，农村里可以把稻草或麦秆切得很短，或用牛粪马粪混在适量的泥里涂在墙上，窗户最好两面糊，中间空，有玻璃的地方除了透光的留下外，从里面再糊一层。同样注意不要把纸贴在玻璃上。各地区都可以按这个原则来选择又经济又美观的不同材料作空气壁。
