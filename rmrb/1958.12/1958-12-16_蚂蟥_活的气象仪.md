Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 15th: The Changhou People's Commune in Nanxian County, Hunan Province, is using leeches to forecast the weather with very good results.

　　One day, Duan Chunzuo, a meteorologist from the Changhou People's Commune, went to the Fifth Brigade to inspect meteorological work. An old farmer, Deng Lenan, told him that leeches could predict the weather. The method is very simple: use a colorless, transparent glass bottle, fill it with water from the pond, put the leech in the bottle, and place the bottle in a corner away from sunlight. When the weather is clear, it sinks to the bottom of the bottle and remains still. Before overcast skies or wind and rain, it will float to the top of the water.

　　Meteorologist Duan Chunzuo went back and conducted many experiments, and they were all very accurate. The first time, he caught a bull leech for testing. During the cold wave on October 22nd, it swayed up and down erratically. After the cold wave, he caught a yellow leech and a green leech, placing these three types of leeches in three glass bottles respectively. During the two cold waves that were about to arrive on November 7th and November 13th, the leeches were all moving up and down in the water. Based on the activity of the leeches, he made cold wave forecasts, and the commune immediately mobilized labor to rush in a large harvest of cotton and rice. The commune members said this local method is very good.

    蚂蟥——活的气象仪
    新华社长沙15日电  湖南省南县长厚人民公社用蚂蟥预报天气，效果很好。
    有一天，长厚人民公社气象员段春作到五大队检查气象工作，老农邓乐南告诉他，蚂蟥能预报天气。方法很简单，用一个无色透明的玻璃瓶，盛满池塘里的清水，把蚂蟥放到瓶里后，将瓶子放在不见阳光的角落里，天气晴朗的时候，它沉在瓶子底下不动，在阴云密布或风雨之前它就会浮到水上面来。
    气象员段春作回去作了多次实验，都很灵验。第一次，他捉了一条牛蚂蟥作试验，在10月22日那次寒潮来临时，它上下不定地摆动。寒潮过后，他又捉了一种黄色的和一种绿色的蚂蟥，把这三种蚂蟥分别放在三个玻璃瓶内，在11月7日和11月13日两次寒潮快要来到时，蚂蟥都在水里上下移动。他根据蚂蟥的活动情况，作了寒潮预报，社里立即动员劳动力抢收了大量棉花和水稻。社员说这个土办法好得很。
