    Major Improvements in the Rural Financial and Trade Management System
    The people's commune system has been implemented in the vast rural areas across the country. This new situation has brought new tasks to the rural financial and trade work: it requires the financial and trade work to improve the management system in accordance with the changes in production, distribution, exchange, and consumption after the people's commune system. The "Decision on Improving the Rural Financial and Trade Management System to Adapt to the Situation of People's Communes," jointly promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council today, clearly stipulates the principles and methods for improving the rural financial and trade system and improving the rural financial and trade work. This is a very timely and significant measure. Implementing and executing this decision will inevitably have an increasingly positive impact on further strengthening financial and trade work, promoting the development of people's commune production and the consolidation of people's communes, as well as promoting the development of the entire national economy.
    The fundamental spirit of improving the rural financial and trade system is to implement the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, implement the devolution of institutions, unified planning, and financial contracting. Specifically, it is to implement the method of "two devolutions, three unifications, and one contract."
    "Two devolutions" means that all personnel and assets of the state's commercial, grain, finance, banking, and other financial and trade departments in rural areas are devolved to the people's communes, which are responsible for management. After the devolution, these institutions are both a component of the people's commune and a grassroots unit of the national financial and trade department. They are under the unified leadership of the people's commune and subject to the professional guidance of higher-level financial and trade departments. "Three unifications" means that the people's communes must obey the state's unified regulations in three aspects: policy implementation, plan formulation, and working capital management. "One contract" means contracting financial tasks, that is, unifying all income from various taxes and profits from devolved enterprises in rural areas, deducting administrative expenses and operating expenses originally paid by the state, and contracting to pay the state according to the difference between income and expenditure.
    After implementing this new method, it is obviously very different from the past financial and trade system, and it is more in line with the requirements of the new situation after the realization of people's communes. First of all, after the financial and trade institutions are devolved to the people's communes, although they are also grassroots units of the national financial and trade departments, they are mainly managed and operated by the people's communes. This makes it easier for the local Party committee to strengthen its leadership over rural financial and trade work, and it is also more convenient to give full play to the enthusiasm for management and operation in accordance with the needs of the commune itself and to promote the role of financial and trade work in promoting production. Secondly, after the grassroots financial and trade work is mainly led by the commune, the financial and trade work can be more closely integrated with the commune's production and distribution, so that the plans of the grassroots financial and trade work can be more practical. Thirdly, the implementation of this method will further ensure the reliable guarantee of the state's financial revenue, and at the same time, it will also help to give full play to the enthusiasm of the people's communes in developing production and increasing accumulation, and simplify the procedures for collection and payment. Therefore, conscientiously implementing the decision on improving the rural financial and trade system will undoubtedly greatly improve the level of the state's entire financial and trade work.
    The improvement of the financial and trade system is of great significance. Judging from the initial trials in various places during this period, although most people have realized its importance ideologically, some cadres still have certain doubts and concerns about this measure. Therefore, unifying the ideological understanding of cadres is obviously very necessary for the rapid and smooth implementation of this decision.
    For example: Some cadres suspect that devolving financial and trade institutions to the people's communes is "a step backward from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership," and they worry that it will "mess things up" after the devolution; some cadres worry that the leading departments of financial and trade work at all levels will have "nothing to do" after the financial and trade institutions are devolved, so they are hesitant to devolve the financial and trade institutions.
    Is devolving financial and trade institutions to the people's communes a step backward from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership? We believe that the development from agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes has expanded and improved the original collective ownership. The people's commune is basically collective ownership, but it contains some components of ownership by the whole people; devolving the state's financial and trade institutions to the people's communes is to increase this component of ownership by the whole people in the people's communes, strengthen the state's leadership over the people's communes, and make it easier for the people's communes to gradually transition to ownership by the whole people. This certainly cannot be said to be a step backward.
    Does the devolution of financial and trade institutions to the people's communes mean that the leading departments of financial and trade work at all levels have "nothing to do"? Of course not. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently pointed out: "People's communes must develop both self-sufficient production that directly meets the needs of the commune, and must develop commodity production as widely as possible in both industry and agriculture. Each commune should, according to its own characteristics, implement the necessary division of labor and commodity exchange with other communes and state-owned enterprises under the leadership of the state." "In a necessary historical period in the future, the commodity production of people's communes, as well as commodity exchange between the state and communes, and between communes and communes, must have a great development."
    It is not difficult to see that with the development of commodity production and the expansion of commodity exchange in the people's communes, various financial and trade tasks such as purchasing and marketing, finance, and credit will inevitably develop and expand accordingly, which requires financial and trade departments at all levels to further strengthen leadership over the financial and trade work of the people's communes in terms of plan management, business guidance, technical assistance, cadre training, supervision, and inspection. The foundation of financial and trade work lies in the commune. It is necessary to help the commune establish and improve its work and related systems, and to always pay attention to strengthening business leadership. The financial and trade departments at all levels are not only "having nothing to do," but on the contrary, their work responsibilities are greatly increased. The idea that there is "nothing to do" after the financial and trade institutions are devolved is unfounded and detrimental to work.
    It should be emphasized that "two devolutions, three unifications, and one contract" is an inseparable and complete unity. We must understand it correctly and comprehensively. If we only "unify" but not "devolve," then the financial and trade work cannot quickly adapt to the new situation after the people's communes; but if we only grasp the "devolution" side and ignore the "unification" side, it is also incorrect, which may cause the financial and trade work of the people's communes to deviate from the state's policies and plans, and may lead to localism. If this situation occurs, it will be detrimental to the consolidation of the people's communes and the development of the entire national economy. Now, some grassroots cadres in individual places believe that after the financial and trade institutions are devolved, the materials of these institutions can be used casually, and the money can be spent casually, so there are chaotic phenomena such as the state and the commune's materials are not separated, the canteen and the warehouse's materials are not separated, and the individual and the collective are not separated. This is obviously a one-sided understanding of the method of "two devolutions, three unifications, and one contract." We must not only criticize the conservative ideas and fear of difficulties that dare not devolve, but also prevent and criticize the incorrect tendency of only one-sidedly emphasizing "devolution" and ignoring "unification." In practical work, the correct attitude towards this issue should be to believe in the leadership of the Party, believe in the power of the masses, and resolutely devolve the rural financial and trade institutions, while at the same time strengthening the political and ideological education of grassroots cadres, so that they fully understand the importance of unified policies, unified plans, and unified working capital management. It can be fully affirmed that as long as the Party committees at all levels strengthen the political and ideological education of the cadres of the people's communes and correct their ideological understanding, the financial and trade work of the communes will take on a new look after the financial and trade system is improved; the various financial and trade tasks stipulated by the state can also be successfully realized.
    After the rural financial and trade institutions are devolved to the people's communes in various places, it is also necessary to strengthen economic accounting work. Since the people's communes have not been established for a long time, various systems are not perfect or even very unsound, which is understandable. But this situation should not be allowed to continue. It should be pointed out that timely solving this problem is of great significance for consolidating the people's communes. The larger the commune and the more socialized the commune's production, the clearer the financial accounting needs to be. Although the people's commune is a unified economic organization that shares profits and losses for the entire commune, this does not mean that the various economic departments and units of the commune do not need to establish their own financial work and do not need to conduct separate accounting. On the contrary, the more economic work develops, the more accurately the economic departments and business units of industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, etc. within the commune should calculate their respective costs, expenses, and operating results. In a word, economic work should be more and more detailed. Therefore, at present, in conjunction with the commune rectification work, a set of necessary systems should be established immediately, such as commercial, financial, and credit management systems, and these systems should be conscientiously implemented. The boundaries between the state and the commune, the collective and the individual, and this unit and that unit must be strictly delineated. Only in this way can we continuously improve business management, and financial and trade work can play a more active role in promoting the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes, promoting production development, and promoting national economic construction.

### 农村财政贸易管理体制的重大改进

    农村财政贸易管理体制的重大改进
    人民公社化已经在全国广大农村实现，这一新的形势给农村财政贸易工作带来了新的任务：要求财政贸易工作根据人民公社化以后在生产、分配、交换、消费等方面引起的变化，相应地改进农村财政贸易工作的管理体制。中共中央和国务院在今天联合公布的“关于适应人民公社化的形势改进农村财政贸易管理体制的决定”，对于改进农村财贸体制、改进农村财贸工作的原则和办法，做了明确的规定。这是一个非常适时的、具有重大意义的措施。贯彻和执行这个决定，对于进一步加强财贸工作，促进人民公社生产的发展和人民公社的巩固，以及对于促进整个国民经济的发展，必将日益产生积极的影响。
    改进农村财贸体制的根本精神是根据统一领导、分级管理的方针，实行机构下放，计划统一，财政包干。具体地说，也就是实行“两放、三统、一包”的办法。
  “两放”就是把国家在农村的商业、粮食、财政、银行等财贸部门的人员和资产全部下放给人民公社，由人民公社负责管理。下放以后，这些机构既是人民公社的一个组成部分，同时又是国家财贸部门的基层单位，它受人民公社的统一领导，并且受上级财贸部门的业务领导。“三统”就是人民公社在政策的执行、计划的制定和流动资金的管理等三个方面必须服从国家的统一规定。“一包”就是包财政任务，也就是把国家在农村中的各项税收和下放企业利润等收入，统一计算，扣除原来由国家开支的行政费和事业费，由公社按收支差额，包干上缴国家。
    实行这个新办法以后，显然和过去财贸体制有了很大不同，它更加符合人民公社化实现以后新情况的要求。首先，财贸机构下放到人民公社以后，它虽然同时也是国家财贸部门的基层单位，但主要是由人民公社负责管理和经营了。这样就更便于当地党委加强对农村财贸工作的领导，也更加便于根据公社本身的需要，因地制宜地发挥管理和经营的积极性，发挥财贸工作对生产的促进作用。其次，基层财贸工作主要由公社领导以后，财贸工作与公社的生产、分配可以更加紧密地结合起来，使基层财贸工作的计划能够更加切合实际。第三，实行这个办法以后，国家的财政收入将进一步获得可靠的保证，同时也有利于充分发挥人民公社发展生产、增加积累的积极性，并且简化征收和缴纳的手续。因此，认真地贯彻执行关于改进农村财贸体制的决定，无疑地也将把国家整个财贸工作的水平大大提高一步。
    财贸体制的改进，意义是重大的。根据这一段时期各地初步试行的情况来看，虽然大部分人已经从思想上认识了它的重要意义，但是也还有一些干部对这一措施抱有某些怀疑和顾虑。因而统一干部的思想认识，对于迅速而又顺利地贯彻执行这一决定，显然是十分必要的。
    例如：有些干部怀疑，财贸机构下放到人民公社，是否“由全民所有制向集体所有制倒退了一步”，他们担心下放以后是否会“搞乱了”；有些干部则担心财贸机构下放以后各级财贸工作的领导部门是否“无事可做”了，因而他们对财贸机构的下放，表现得束手束脚。
    把财贸机构下放给人民公社，是不是由全民所有制向集体所有制后退了一步呢？我们认为：由农业生产合作社发展到人民公社，使原有的集体所有制扩大了和提高了，人民公社基本上是集体所有制，但它包含了若干全民所有制的成分；国家财贸机构下放给人民公社，就是增加了人民公社这种全民所有制的成分，加强了国家对人民公社的领导，更加便于人民公社逐步地向全民所有制过渡。这当然不能说是后退。
    财贸机构下放到人民公社以后，是否意味着各级财贸领导部门“无事可做”了呢？当然也不是。最近中共中央六中全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中曾经指出：“人民公社无论在工业方面和农业方面，既要发展直接满足本社需要的自给性生产，又必须尽可能广泛地发展商品性生产。各个公社应当根据自己的特点，在国家领导下，同别的公社和国营企业实行必要的生产分工和商品交换。”“在今后一个必要的历史时期内，人民公社的商品生产，以及国家和公社、公社和公社之间的商品交换，必须有一个很大的发展。”
    这就不难看出，随着人民公社商品生产的发展和商品交换的扩大，各项财贸工作如购销、财政、信贷等业务也必然要相应地发展和扩大，这就需要各级财贸部门对于人民公社财贸工作进一步在计划管理、业务指导、技术帮助、干部训练、督促检查等方面加强领导。财贸工作的基础在公社。必须帮助公社把工作和有关的制度建立和健全起来，并且经常注意加强业务方面的领导。各级财贸部门不仅不是“无事可做”，相反地，它们的工作责任是大大加重了。认为财贸机构下放以后“无事可做”的想法是没有任何根据的，也是不利于工作的。
    应当强调地指出，“两放、三统、一包”，是一个不可分割的完整的统一体。我们对它必须全面地正确地加以理解。如果只“统”不“放”，那末财贸工作就不能迅速地适应人民公社化以后的新形势；但是如果只抓住了“放”的一面，忽视了“统”的一面，同样也是不正确的，这样就可能使人民公社的财贸工作脱离国家政策和计划的轨道，就可能产生本位主义。如果出现这种情况，对于人民公社的巩固和整个国民经济的发展都是不利的。现在已有个别地方的基层干部，认为财贸机构下放了，这些机构的物资可以随便使用了，钱可以随便花了，因而出现了国家和公社的物资不分，食堂和仓库的物资不分，个人和集体不分等混乱现象。这显然是对“两放三统一包”的办法的片面的理解。我们既要批判不敢下放的保守思想和畏难情绪，又要防止和批判只片面地强调“放”而忽视了“统”的不正确倾向，在当前特别应该注意防止后一种倾向。在实际工作中，对待这一问题的正确态度，应该是既要相信党的领导、相信群众的力量，坚决地把农村财贸机构下放，同时又必须加强对基层干部的政治思想教育工作，使他们充分理解统一政策、统一计划和统一流动资金管理的重要性。完全可以肯定，只要各级党委加强对人民公社干部的政治思想教育工作，端正他们的思想认识，在财贸体制改进以后，公社的财贸工作就会出现新的气象；国家规定的各项财贸任务，也就可以顺利地实现。
    各地在农村财贸机构下放到人民公社以后，还必须加强经济核算工作。由于人民公社建立起来的时间还不长，各种制度一时还不完备甚至很不健全，这是可以理解的。但是这种情况不应该任其继续下去。应该指出，及时解决这个问题，对于巩固人民公社具有重要的意义。公社愈大，公社生产愈采取社会的规模，财务会计就愈需要搞得清清楚楚。人民公社虽然是一个统一的经济组织，由全社共负盈亏，但这决不能认为公社所属的各个经济部门和单位可以不必建立自己的财务工作，不必分别进行核算了。相反的，经济工作越是发展，公社内部的工业、农业、商业、交通运输等经济部门和经营单位，也就越应该精确地各自计算成本、费用和经营成果。一句话，经济工作应该越作越细致。因此，目前应当结合整社工作，立即着手建立一套必要的制度，例如商业、财务、信贷管理等制度，并且认真地执行这些制度。把国家的和公社的、集体的和个人的、这个单位和那个单位的界限严格地划分清楚，只有这样，才能不断地改善经营管理，财贸工作也才能在促进人民公社的巩固和提高、促进生产发展以及促进国家经济建设等方面，发挥更为积极的作用。
