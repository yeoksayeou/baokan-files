    Historical Friendship Between the Chinese and German Working Classes
    The people of China and Germany have a traditional fighting friendship. The working classes of both countries have supported each other in the struggle for freedom and liberation. During China's First Revolutionary Civil War, the German working class provided valuable support. In 1927, representatives of the Chinese working class went to Berlin to present a banner to [Ernst] Thälmann in gratitude.
