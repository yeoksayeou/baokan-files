    Cultivating Communist New People in Labor Competitions
    ——On the Socialist Labor Brigade Movement in Czechoslovakia
    By our correspondents  Yang Yi  Lin Hai
    After the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward the task of completing socialist construction, especially after the recent proposal by the CPC Central Committee to launch a nationwide discussion on raising the people's living standards, the political enthusiasm and social responsibility of the Czechoslovak working people have been further enhanced. They see more clearly the beautiful prospects of the communism they are striving for, and appreciate the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the working people. In order to accelerate the building of socialism, the workers feel that the current mode of labor competition can no longer meet the requirements of the developing situation. In the discussion, they put forward the slogan of pushing the socialist production competition to a higher level, which led to the idea of organizing the competition in a new way.
    Just at this time, the news of the great initiative of the Soviet people in establishing "Communist Labor Teams" reached Prague, and the slogan "Work, study and live in the spirit of communism" inspired and enlightened the Czechoslovak working class. On November 30th, miners from the 50th and 62nd work teams of the Nosek Coal Mine first proposed the initiative to strive for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" at the mine-wide celebration of the early completion of this year's production tasks. This initiative, like other exciting events, quickly spread throughout the country and was enthusiastically responded to by laborers in factories and mines everywhere.
    We visited the coal mine named after the revolutionary leader Nosek and its 50th and 62nd work teams bathed in the winter sun. These were originally two advanced work teams, but they felt that their production achievements still could not meet the needs of the Party and the country, and they felt that in order to better complete the production tasks, it was necessary to strengthen the collaboration between the various work teams and departments, and to raise all the workers of the entire coal mine to an advanced level. They believe that the slogan put forward by the Soviet workers is a comprehensive slogan with both clear political requirements and strict economic requirements. Therefore, they also put forward eight guarantees for striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade." These guarantees include strict requirements on the quality and speed of completing production tasks, requirements for saving and cherishing public property, requirements for consciously observing labor discipline and safety regulations, requirements for improving technical level and economic knowledge, and more importantly, they proposed that "members of the socialist labor brigade must play an exemplary role in work, life and social activities with a high degree of political awareness."
    Ksenik, a young worker from the 50th work team, said: "The past forms and content of competition are no longer in line with today's requirements. If we want to produce more, better and more economically, we must think of new ways." He said that the Party Central Committee's letter to the people on raising the people's living standards was so exciting to us, and the initiative of the Soviet "Communist Labor Teams" inspired us. With the help of the Party organization and the administration, we studied their experience and the specific conditions of our socialist construction, and thus formed the idea of ​​launching a competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade." He told us that the glorious title of socialist labor brigade cannot be obtained solely by subjective wishes. We must occupy it with our glorious and arduous labor.
    The workers all talked about the latest content of this competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade," which is the explicit goal of cultivating new people with socialist and communist spirits. An old worker said that educating people is the most important and difficult task. But we must do this work, especially for young workers, and we should not abandon the responsibility of education and cultivation.
    When we asked about the development of the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement in the Nosek Coal Mine, Director Dvořák answered this question very excitedly. He pointed out that the movement has now been launched throughout the mine. In half a month, nearly half of the workers have participated in this competition. Any work team that has continuously completed the eight guarantees for more than a month can obtain the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" after application and approval. If this work team fails to complete the guarantee and fails to improve for 14 consecutive days, this title will be cancelled accordingly. However, its title can be restored after all shortcomings are corrected.
    Dvořák especially introduced to the reporters the growth of the new atmosphere in the mining area. He said that in the past, in the competition, each unit only cared about completing its own quota, but now everyone has the spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual help, thus promoting the overall improvement of coal mine production. In particular, the workers have put forward the idea of helping backward work teams and backward workers with a comradely attitude, so the political life of the workers has become active, criticism and self-criticism have also been carried out, and before leaving work every shift, they actively clean up tools and assist the workers of the next shift in preparing their work. This saves time and improves labor efficiency. The workers are also more concerned about the production of the entire coal mine than before, and put forward many suggestions and criticisms that are beneficial to the entire coal mine. Dvořák said that the workers' political awareness has been raised, so they stand tall and see far. Many work teams participating in the competition constantly raise their requirements for themselves. At present, everyone in the Nosek Coal Mine is eagerly considering how to win the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Brigade." The workers are using every effort to eliminate those factors that prevent them from obtaining this title. In such a mass movement full of socialist spirit, no individual or collective will be allowed to fall behind for a long time.
    The production achievements of the Nosek Coal Mine in the half month since the launch of the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement have also shown its great superiority. In the first half of December, nearly 2,000 tons more coal were mined than in the first half of November, an increase in production of 8%. The Nosek Coal Mine was originally a relatively backward coal mine, and it had not yet completed the state production tasks very well until last year. Because of this, the leaders of the coal mine were replaced, and Dvořák, who was originally the secretary of the county party committee, was sent to be the director of the mine. After coming to the coal mine, this person with rich practical experience and a humble style closely relied on the leadership of the Party, and well implemented the Party's mass line work method, greatly improved the workers' level of awareness and enthusiasm, and improved the organization and management of production. As a result, this year's annual production plan was completed one month and three days ahead of schedule, and production increased by 50% compared to last year. This remarkable achievement earned the coal mine the government and trade union red flags and leaped into the ranks of the advanced. The reason why the Nosek Coal Mine was able to propose the initiative to establish a "Socialist Labor Brigade" this time is closely related to the strengthening of political work by the Party organization of the coal mine since this year. And the "Socialist Labor Brigade" movement is also gradually carried out completely under the leadership and help of the Party. After the 50th work team and the 62nd work team put forward the initiative, the Party organization immediately helped them discuss it, clarified some problems that were not clear at the beginning, put forward more comprehensive conditions, summarized the experience in a timely manner, and immediately guided the masses to invest in this competition. In particular, the Party organization used the competition to urge the mine leaders to move to the forefront of the mass movement more quickly, mobilized Party members to promote advanced experience to other workshops, and further strengthened political and ideological work to ensure the political content of this competition. The initiative of the Nosek Coal Mine is being widely and deeply unfolded throughout the country. In the coal mine, machinery manufacturing and consumer goods industries, a mass movement to strive for the title of "Socialist Labor Brigade" is taking shape, and other departments are also gradually developing. The CPC Central Committee and the government gave great support to this initiative. Recently, the Party Central Committee sent a working group to the Nosek Coal Mine to summarize its experience in order to further promote it. The CPC Central Committee and the Central Council of the Czech Trade Union have both discussed this issue specifically.

    在劳动竞赛中培养共产主义新人
    ——关于捷克斯洛伐克社会主义劳动队运动
    本报记者  杨翊  林海
    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会提出完成社会主义建设的任务，特别是最近捷共中央提出开展关于提高人民生活水平的全民讨论以后，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的政治积极性和社会责任感进一步昂扬起来。他们更真切地看到了他们所奔赴的共产主义的美好远景，体会到共产党和人民政府对劳动人民的关怀。为了加速建成社会主义，工人们感到现时的劳动竞赛方式已不能满足形势发展的要求。他们在讨论中提出把社会主义生产竞赛推向更高水平的口号，因而产生了以新的方式来组织竞赛的思想。
    正在这个时候，苏联人民建立“共产主义劳动工作队”的伟大创举的消息传到了布拉格，“以共产主义的精神来工作、学习和生活”的口号鼓舞和启发了捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级。11月30日诺塞克煤矿的第五十和六十二工作队的矿工们，首先在全矿庆祝提前完成今年生产任务的大会上提出了争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的倡议。这一倡议正像其他激动人心的事件一样，很快就传遍全国，得到各地工厂矿山劳动者的热烈响应。
    我们浴着冬日的阳光访问了这个以革命领袖诺塞克命名的煤矿和它的第五十和六十二工作队。这原来就是两个先进工作队，可是他们感到他们的生产成绩仍然不能适应党和国家的需要，而且他们感到要更好地完成生产任务必须加强各个工作队和各个部门之间的协作，把整个煤矿的工人都提高到先进水平。他们认为苏联工人提出的口号是既有明确的政治要求又有严格的经济要求的全面的口号，因此，他们也提出了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的八项保证。这些保证包括对于完成生产任务的质量和速度上的严格的要求，节约和爱护公物的要求，自觉遵守劳动纪律和安全条例的要求，提高技术水平和经济知识的要求，更重要的是他们提出了“社会主义劳动队的成员必须以高度的政治觉悟在工作、生活和社会活动中起模范作用”的条件。
    第五十工作队的青年工人克塞尼克说：“过去的竞赛形式和内容已经不符合今天的要求了。我们要更多、更好、更省地进行生产，就必须想新的办法。”他说，党中央关于提高人民生活水平的告人民书是这样令我们兴奋，而且苏联“共产主义劳动工作队”的创议又启发了我们，在党组织和行政的帮助下，我们研究了他们的经验和我们建设社会主义的具体条件，因此形成了发起一个争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的思想。他告诉我们说，社会主义劳动队的光荣称号，决不是光凭主观愿望就能取得的，我们要以自己光荣而艰巨的劳动去占有它。
    工人们都谈到这次争取“社会主义劳动队”称号竞赛中最新的内容，就是提出了培养具有社会主义和共产主义精神的新人的明确目标。有一位老工人说，教育人是最重要而又最艰难的工作。但我们必需去做这个工作，特别是对青年工人，不应放弃教育和培养的责任。
    当我们问到“社会主义劳动队”运动在诺塞克煤矿开展的情况时，矿长德沃尔塔十分兴奋地回答了这个问题。他指出，现在已在全矿掀起了这一运动。在半个月的时间内，已有将近一半的工人参加了这项竞赛。凡是连续一个月以上完成了八项保证的工作队，经过申请和批准可以得到“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。如果这个工作队一旦完不成保证而又连续十四天未能改进时，这一称号也就随之取消。但当缺点全部纠正后仍可恢复它的称号。
    德沃尔塔特别向记者介绍了矿区中新的风气的成长。他说，过去竞赛中各单位只顾自己完成定额，而现在大家都有了互相协作互相帮助的精神，因此促进了煤矿生产的全面提高。特别是工人们提出了以同志式的态度帮助落后的工作队和落后的工人，因之工人们的政治生活活跃了，批评和自我批评也开展起来，每班下班之前都主动收拾好工具，协助下一班的工人做好准备工作。这样就节约了时间，提高了劳动效率。工人们也都比以前更关心全煤矿的生产，并提出很多对整个煤矿有益的建议和批评。德沃尔塔说，工人们政治觉悟提高了也就站得高看得远了。许多参加竞赛的工作队经常不断提高对自己的要求。目前在诺塞克煤矿大家都在急切地考虑怎样争取“社会主义劳动队”这一光荣称号。工人们用一切努力消除那些阻碍他们获得这一称号的因素。在这样一个充满社会主义精神的群众性的运动中，是不会让任何个人或集体长久掉队的。
    诺塞克煤矿在“社会主义劳动队”运动开展以来半个月的生产成绩，也显示了它的巨大优越性。12月上半月比11月上半月就多挖掘了近二千吨煤，提高了生产8％。诺塞克煤矿原来是一个较落后的煤矿，到去年都还没有很好完成国家生产任务。为了这一点，更换了煤矿的领导，派来了原来担任县委书记的德沃尔塔来担任矿长。这个有着丰富实际经验和作风谦逊的人来到煤矿后，密切依靠党的领导，并很好地贯彻了党的群众路线的工作方法，大大提高了工人们的觉悟水平和积极性，改进了生产的组织和管理，因此今年提前一个月零三天完成全年生产计划，并比去年增产50％。这一显著成就使煤矿获得了政府和工会的红旗，跃进到先进的行列。诺塞克煤矿这次所以能够提出成立“社会主义劳动队”的创议，与今年以来煤矿的党组织加强了政治工作密切有关。而“社会主义劳动队”运动也完全是在党的领导和帮助下逐渐开展的。当第五十工作队和六十二工作队提出创议后，党组织即时帮助他们讨论，明确了一些开始时并不明确的问题，提出了更全面的条件，及时总结了经验，并且马上引导群众投入这一竞赛。特别是党组织利用竞赛督促矿的领导更快地走到群众运动的前面去，动员党员把先进经验推广到其他车间，并进一步加强政治思想工作以保证这次竞赛的政治内容。诺塞克煤矿的创议正在全国广泛而深入地展开，在煤矿、机器制造业和消费品工业部门，一个群众性争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的运动正在形成，其他部门也在逐步开展。捷共中央和政府对这个创议给予极大的支持。最近党中央派出一个工作组到诺塞克煤矿总结了它的经验，以便进一步推广。捷共中央和捷工会中央理事会都专门讨论这一问题。
