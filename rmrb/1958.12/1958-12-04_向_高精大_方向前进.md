    Moving Towards “High, Precision, and Large”
    Li Zhongyuan, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry
    Tianjin is said to be an industrial city, but in terms of equipment in the mechanical industry, its strength is relatively weak. The city's largest equipment included only an eight-meter lathe, a two-ton forging hammer, and a two-meter vertical lathe. The largest five-ton cupola furnace was only installed in July. In the past few years, large castings and forgings had to be processed in Shenyang, Taiyuan, and Jinan, and the connecting rods for eighty-horsepower diesel engines had to be processed in Changchun.
    The situation of the Great Leap Forward requires us to develop new products in the direction of high, precision, and large. Therefore, in the spirit of breaking superstitions, liberating our minds, and daring to think and act, we arranged for various factories to produce a batch of new "high, precision, and large" products, such as a 2,500-ton hydraulic press, a 15,000-kilowatt turbine generator, a 12,000-kilowatt turbine generator, and a five-ton steam hammer. Many of these products not only had not been produced before, but also had never been seen. However, the vast number of workers have great confidence. They said, "Don't look at the big task, we are not afraid. If mechanical workers double their output, fitters will become mechanized." After hard work, by the end of October, more than 17,000 sets of smelting equipment were completed. Factories under the Tianjin Mechanical and Electrical Industry Bureau system have self-made and modified 1,129 sets of indigenous equipment; of which 784 sets were self-made and 345 sets were modified.
    From the perspective of processing technology, they are diverse, including various cutting machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, planers, grinders, shapers, and boring machines, as well as forging, casting, electrical, lifting, welding, and other equipment, almost including the entire cold and hot processing process. The manufacture of these equipments has the characteristics of simple form, making do with available resources, using local materials, adapting to local conditions, spending less money, and achieving quick results. It is also easy to master and can solve key problems in production in a timely manner.
    Most of the factories producing these products are small factories with simple equipment. For example, the turbine factory was originally a small machinery factory under the logistics department of the North China Military Region. While building a new factory, we required this small factory to trial-produce a 15,000-kilowatt turbine and governor. However, at that time, the largest lathe in the factory was an eight-foot lathe, the cupola furnace was only two tons, and there was no vertical lathe. They sent people to the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory to study and obtained drawings. After returning to the factory, they first mobilized workers to build equipment. In less than three months, they not only completed the manufacturing tasks of smelting equipment, but also made a four-meter vertical lathe weighing 80 tons, a heavy-duty six-meter lathe, a 25-ton gantry crane, a five-ton cupola furnace, a large heat treatment kiln, and five-meter flat plates. The four-meter vertical lathe should have been equipped with thirteen motors and four tool rests, but they only installed four motors and one tool rest; the six-meter lathe was pieced together with several old bed surfaces, which the workers called "pieced together six-meter lathe." This factory successfully trial-produced a turbine main shaft made of nodular cast iron instead of No. 35 steel forging; this shaft weighed eight tons, was 3.1 meters long, and had a flange diameter of 900 millimeters at both ends.
    Another example is the Hero Workshop of the Forging Press Machine Factory (because the workshop's factory buildings and equipment were old, but it was able to comprehensively complete the plan for more than 20 consecutive months, so it was named the Hero Workshop in July). The workshop branch secretary, workshop director, technicians, and various functional staff members were all from worker backgrounds. Technician Ning Peikuan worked diligently, combined closely with the workers, and successively made special tools for processing hammer bodies of types A and B, mobile cylinder boring machines, mobile automatic cylinder grinding machines, fixed cylinder grinding machines, indigenous milling machines, and indigenous boring machines. It takes 128 hours to process a steam hammer body with an imported boring machine, while it only takes 24 hours to process it with an indigenous boring machine. Due to the addition of special equipment, the monthly output of steam hammers increased from nine to one hundred; in the past, it could only produce 65 kg and 150 kg, but later it could produce 300 kg and 400 kg steam hammers.
    Others include the large-eye boring machine, large gear milling machine, and mobile shaper self-made by the Paper Printing Machinery Factory, and the rotary arc-shaped simple lathe of the Xin Gonglian Machinery Manufacturing Factory. The structures are very simple, but they can process large parts.
    Several factories have the following experiences in the work of self-making and modifying equipment:
    First, "Do it if we agree, debate if we disagree, and experiment if we don't believe", "Strive for success, prepare for failure, accept experience, and prepare to come again." These are the methods and slogans put forward by several factories in carrying out ideological work in the work of self-made indigenous equipment and large equipment. There are many ideological obstacles encountered in the work. The most difficult to solve are technical personnel, especially senior intellectuals. They always say: "There is no basis", "Unscientific", and some say: "Be cautious, don't let a false step cause eternal regret, it may be a lifetime thing". The most typical example is a technician named Zhao Fuchang at the Turbine Factory. The factory decided to let him and the workers design a four-meter vertical lathe together. He did not say a word for several days and just shook his head. When the workers asked him urgently, he said, "You workers dare to think and dare to do, it doesn't matter what you say, but I have to take responsibility for what I say." Later, he used the excuse of being sick and went to the hospital. For ideological differences, the factories organized debates in a timely manner. When the debate reached the point of where the first large machine tool came from, the skeptics began to admit defeat. The Dazhong Iron Factory used the facts that it had been able to cast Cangxian lions, Jingzhou pagodas, Jiahe large iron bells, and Dongguang iron Bodhisattvas in the past to persuade many people. The workers of the Xin Gonglian Machinery Factory posted a big-character poster: "A barrel weighs nine tons, flanges nibbled on-site, boldly breaking superstitions, facts break the theory of conditions."
    Second, many people say that large machines cannot be manufactured without large equipment. This is not the case. The Dazhong Iron Factory used two round steels as tracks, an old bed surface as a tool rest, and installed two vertical milling heads to process the large parts of a five-meter gantry planer. The large gear of the four-meter vertical lathe in the Turbine Factory has a diameter of 2.6 meters and weighs more than six tons, and the base weighs seven tons. They are all processed by setting up two large flat plates. When experts came to the factory to see the machine tools used for processing, they could not find them. Because the shaft holes of the large gear are processed by connecting boring bars to the drill rods of the radial drilling machine; the base is installed with a transmission device next to it, and the workpiece is driven by a belt, and two tool rests are installed on the flat plate for processing. Large castings are cast by setting up a front furnace next to a small cupola furnace to store molten iron, and small group furnaces are used to cooperate. This is called "small chickens lay big eggs, even chickens can lay eggs."
    Third, these simple indigenous equipment are the crystallization of decades of labor experience of workers. Although the structure is simple, the principle is very scientific. If further sorted out and improved, many can become complete "high, precision, and large" equipment. For example, the special equipment made by the Forging Press Machine Factory is two to ten times more efficient than imported equipment. The large-eye boring machine self-made by the Paper Printing Machinery Factory has a boring bar of 250 mm and can bore large holes of 600 to 900 mm, with a cutting speed of 40.5 meters per minute. Large gear milling machines can mill large gears with an outer diameter of 2.4 meters and gears with more than twelve modules, and the accuracy can meet the requirements. Therefore, we must not confuse "indigenous" with "rough," and we should not underestimate indigenous things.
    Fourth, through the mass-based construction of indigenous equipment, the vast number of workers, especially veteran technicians, have greatly raised their eyebrows. In the past, factories, especially large factories, had various restrictions on workers. For example, one person could not operate more than two models of machine tools, had no right to inquire about design, and even if a worker's skills were high, he could only be a technician at most, not an engineer. After carrying out the mass movement, these constraints were broken. Ning Peikuan, a technician from the Hero Workshop of the Forging Press Machine Factory, who came from a worker background, solicited workers' opinions before designing each piece of equipment, and then convened workers for collective review after the design, so the equipment he designed was very popular among the workers. Shen Shixiang, a 52-year-old worker at the Paper Printing Machinery Factory, was sent by the factory to Chongqing and Shanghai by plane, which moved him to tears. During his visit to Shanghai, he spent four nights designing a large-eye boring machine, and after returning to the factory, he designed a large gear milling machine in one night. At a symposium, he said: "When I heard that China only has 260,000 machine tools, which is not as good as Japan, I felt really anxious. I must design more suitable machine tools in the future." From this, it can be seen that it is very important to let workers participate in design and manufacturing.

    向“高精大”方向前进
    天津市机电工业局局长  李仲垣
    天津市说起来是一个工业城市，但是在机械工业的装备方面，力量还是比较薄弱的。全市最大的设备仅有一台八公尺车床，一台二吨的锻锤和一台二公尺的立式车床，最大的一座五吨冲天炉是7月份才安装好的。几年来，凡是大的铸锻件都要到沈阳、太原、济南去加工，八十马力柴油机的连杆要到长春去加工。
    大跃进的形势要求我们向高、精、大试制新产品的方向发展。于是，我们就本着破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢干的精神布置各厂生产一批“高、精、大”的新产品，例如二千五百吨的水压机、一万五千瓩的水轮机组、一万二千瓩的汽轮机组和五吨蒸汽锤等。其中有很多产品不但是过去所没有生产过的，而且还是从未见过的。但是，广大职工的信心很大。他们说，“甭看任务大，我们并不怕，机工翻一番，钳工机械化”。经过苦战，截至10月底就完成了冶炼设备一万七千余台。天津机电工业局系统所属工厂已自制和改装了土设备一千一百二十九台；其中属于自制的设备有七百八十四台，属于改装的设备有三百四十五台。
    从加工工艺看是多种多样的，包括车、铣、刨、磨、插、镗等各种切削机床和锻压、铸造、电气、起重、焊接等设备，几乎包括了冷、热加工的全部工艺过程。这些设备的制造都具有形态朴实，因陋就简，就地取材，因地制宜，花钱少，收效快的特点，而且便于掌握，又能及时解决生产中的关键问题。
    生产这些产品的工厂，多数是些设备简陋的小工厂。如水轮机厂，原来是华北军区后勤部的一个小机械厂，在建新厂的同时，我们要求这个小厂试制出一万五千瓩的水轮机和调速器。可是当时全厂最大的车床是八尺车床，冲天炉只是两吨的，又没有立式车床。他们派人到哈尔滨电机厂学习，并且要来了图纸，回厂就先发动职工搞设备，不到三个月，不但完成了冶炼设备的制造任务，还制成重八十吨的四公尺立式车床一台、重型六公尺车床一台、二十五吨龙门吊车一台、五吨冲天炉和大型热处理窑、五公尺平板等设备。四公尺立式车床本来应该装十三个马达，四个刀架，他们只装了四个马达，一个刀架；六公尺车床是用几个旧床面拼凑起来的，工人叫它“拼凑六米车床”。这个厂试制成功以球墨铸铁代替三十五号钢锻制成水轮机主轴；这根轴重八吨，长三点一公尺，两端法兰直径为九百公厘。
    又如锻压机床厂英雄车间（由于这个车间厂房、设备陈旧，而能连续二十多个月全面地完成计划，因此7月份被命名为英雄车间）是专做汽锤的，车间支部书记、车间主任、技术员和各职能员都是工人出身，技术员宁培宽刻苦钻研，同工人密切结合，先后作成加工锤体的甲乙型专用工具、移动式搪缸机、移动式自动磨缸机、固定式磨缸机、土铣床和土搪床等专用机床。用进口搪床加工一台汽锤锤身需一百二十八个小时，而用土制搪床加工只要二十四个小时就可以了。由于增添了专用设备，蒸汽锤的月产量从九台提高到一百台；过去只能生产六十五公斤和一百五十公斤的，后来能生产三百公斤、四百公斤的蒸汽锤。
    其他还有造纸印刷机厂自制的大眼搪床、大型铣齿机、移动式插床，新工联机器制造厂的旋弧型简易车床等，结构都很简单，但能加工大件。
    几个工厂在自制和改装设备的工作中，有以下几点体会：
    一、“一致就干，不一致就辩，不信就试验”、“争取成功，准备失败，接受经验，准备再来”。这是几个工厂在自制土设备、大设备工作中，进行思想工作时所提出的方法和口号。工作中遇到的思想障碍是很多的。其中最难解决的是技术人员，特别是高级知识分子，他们总是说：“无根据”、“不科学”，还有的说：“得慎重点，别叫一失足成千古恨，弄不好是一辈子的事”。最典型的是水轮机厂一个名叫赵福昌的技术员，厂里决定让他和工人一起进行四公尺立式车床的设计，他几天不哼，光摇脑袋，工人问得急了，他才说：“你们工人敢想敢干说了没关系，我说了得负责任”，后来他就借口有病住医院去了。对于思想分歧，各厂都及时组织辩论，当争论到第一台大机床是哪里来的时候，怀疑的人才开始认输。大众铁工厂就用过去能铸成沧县狮子、景州塔、交河大铁钟、东光铁菩萨的事实，说服了许多人。新工联机器厂的工人贴出这样一张大字报：“一个筒体重九吨，两头法兰就地啃，胆大包天破迷信，事实打破条件论”。
    二、不少人说，没有大设备就不能制造大机器。事实并非如此。大众铁工厂就用两根圆钢作道轨，一个旧床面子作刀架，装上两个立铣头，来加工五公尺龙门刨床的大件。水轮机厂四公尺立式车床的直径二点六公尺，重六吨多的大牙轮和七吨的底座，都是用两块大平板架起来加工的。专家来工厂要看加工用的机床，却找不到了。因为大牙轮的轴孔是在摇臂钻的钻杆上接上搪杆来代替加工的；底座是在旁边安个传动装置，用皮带带动工作物，平板上装两个刀架进行加工的。大的铸件都是在小化铁炉旁设前炉，储存铁水，并有小群炉配合来进行浇铸的，这叫做“小鸡下大蛋，无鸡也下蛋”。
    三、这些简单的土设备都是工人几十年劳动经验的结晶，结构虽然简单，但道理却很科学，如果进一步加以整理和提高，许多是可以成为完整的“高、精、大”设备的。例如，锻压机床厂做的专用设备比进口设备的效率高二倍到十倍。造纸印刷机厂自制的大眼搪床，搪杆二百五十公厘，能搪六百到九百公厘的大孔，切削速度每分钟为四十点五公尺。大型铣齿机可以铣外径二点四公尺的大牙轮，和十二个模数以上的齿轮，精度都可以达到要求。因此，我们不能把“土”和“粗”混淆起来，更不应该轻视土的。
    四、通过群众性的大搞土设备，广大工人特别是老技术工人大大地扬眉吐气，以往，工厂特别是大工厂，对工人有种种限制，例如，一人不能操作两种型号以上的机床，无权过问设计，工人技术高了顶多只能当技师，不能当工程师。大搞群众运动以后，把这些约束都冲破了。锻压机床厂英雄车间工人出身的技术员宁培宽，设计每种设备之前都征求工人的意见，设计后又召集工人进行集体审查，因此他设计的设备很受工人欢迎。造纸印刷机厂五十二岁的老工人沈士祥，厂里让他坐飞机到重庆、上海参观，使他感动得流泪，他在上海参观期间用四个晚上的时间，设计出大眼搪孔机，回厂后一晚上又设计出大型铣齿机。在一次座谈会上他说：“一听到咱中国才只有二十六万台机床，还不如日本，心里实在着急，今后一定要多设计些适用的机床。”由此可以看出，让工人参加设计、制造，是十分重要的。
