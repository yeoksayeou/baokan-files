    Everyone Should Utilize Biogas
    Yu Ming
    Judging from the popularization of biogas in Fuyang County, the utilization of biogas is something worth greatly promoting. The masses in this county not only use biogas for cooking and lighting, but also use it to power machinery, drive blowers for steelmaking, drive lathes for producing bearings, and drive water pumps and small steel mills. They are now experimenting with compressing biogas, and if the experiment is successful, it can be used to power cars and tractors. According to statistics, this county alone, in the two areas of using biogas for cooking and lighting, can save the state 800 million jin of fuel and more than 5 million jin of kerosene per year.
    However, regarding the utilization of biogas, there is currently a misconception that biogas work is a scientific endeavor, only to be researched and experimented with by scientific and technical personnel, while ordinary farmers are not yet capable of utilizing it. Therefore, the work of researching and utilizing biogas has remained in the hands of a few scientific and technical personnel.
    Utilizing biogas is a scientific endeavor, which is undeniable, but it is not mysterious; it is a science that is easy to grasp. Now everyone in Fuyang County already knows how to utilize biogas, not only being able to use manure and other materials to produce biogas, but also being able to utilize natural biogas from mud ditches and ponds, just as the farmers in Fuyang say: "Working with biogas is not difficult, a bamboo pole and a boat, at most no more than ten minutes, to obtain enough for a whole day." Precisely because of this, whether in plains or mountains, inland or border regions, there are conditions for utilizing and producing biogas, because those places all have mud ponds, sludge ditches, and manure and garbage.
    The experience of Fuyang is that to promote the utilization of biogas, in addition to leaders personally experimenting, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to engage in it. Only in this way can the wisdom of the masses be gathered, the creative inventions of the masses be encouraged, various mysterious viewpoints be broken, and a set of experiences be created.
    Recently, when the Ministry of Agriculture held an on-site biogas meeting in Fuyang, it proposed to universally promote the utilization of biogas throughout the country, which is in line with the current requirements of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, it is also achievable. The question is whether the leadership can break superstitions and liberate their minds? Whether they can mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement? If they can, then everywhere will be like Fuyang County, and the work of utilizing biogas can be quickly and fully launched. (Attached picture)

    大家都来利用沼气
    于明
    从阜阳县推广沼气的情况看来，利用沼气这件事情值得大大提倡。这个县的群众不但利用沼气做饭、点灯，而且还用来开动机器，带动鼓风机炼钢，带动车床生产轴承，带动抽水机、小钢磨等。现在正在试验压缩沼气，试验成功以后，可以用来开动汽车和拖拉机。据统计，这个县仅在利用沼气做饭和点灯这两项上，一年就可为国家节省燃料八亿斤，煤油五百多万斤。
    但是在利用沼气这个问题上，现在有一种错误看法，就是认为沼气工作是一种科学工作，只有科学技术人员可以研究试验，而一般农民还无条件利用。因此，研究和利用沼气的工作一直停留在少数科学技术人员手中。
    利用沼气是一项科学工作，这是不可否认的，但是它并不神秘，这是很容易掌握的一种科学。现在阜阳县就已经人人都会利用沼气，不但可以利用粪便等制造沼气，而且可以利用泥沟塘里的天然沼气，正如阜阳农民说的：“搞沼气不费难，一根竹竿一只船，最多不过十分钟，取的一天用不完。”正因为如此，无论在平原或山区、内地或边疆，都有条件利用和制造沼气，因为那些地方都有沼泥塘、污泥沟和粪便、垃圾。
    阜阳的经验，要推广利用沼气，除了领导亲自试验外，还要发动群众去搞。这样才可以集中群众的智慧，鼓舞群众的创造发明，打破各种各样的神秘观点，创造一套经验。
    最近，农业部在阜阳召开沼气现场会议的时候，提出要在全国普遍推广利用沼气，这是符合当前工农业生产的要求的。因此，也是办得到的。问题在于领导是不是能够破除迷信，解放思想？是不是能够发动群众，大搞群众运动？如果能够的话，那么各地都会像阜阳县一样，利用沼气的工作，就可以很快全面展开。（附图片）
