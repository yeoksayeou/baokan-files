Comprehensively Utilizing Cattle to Enhance Economic Value
Siyang Commune-Run Integrated Cattle Service, Milk, and Breeding Farm

(Reported by this newspaper) In two months, Siyang County, Jiangsu, established commune-run integrated cattle service, milk, and breeding farms and dairy product processing factories in every commune. Now, all the elderly in the county's twenty-seven communes' homes for the aged, children in kindergartens, and weak commune members are eating fresh milk every day. The dairy product factory has processed the remaining fresh milk into seven kinds of dairy products, such as condensed milk, milk powder, cream, lactose, and casein.

Siyang County achieved an unprecedented comprehensive bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, fundamentally changing the impoverished situation of the old disaster area. In order to promote greater leaps in agricultural production and meet the ever-increasing needs of the people's material lives, the county party committee decided to vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of cattle for service, milk, and breeding throughout the county. It strives to increase the number of cattle from the existing 30,000 to a greater leap within three years, and to expand the consumption of milk from the current elderly and children to all those who need it.

Using local yellow cattle and water buffalo for milking is unprecedented in the history of Siyang County. At the beginning of promoting cattle milking, many people had concerns. They were afraid that local cattle would not produce milk, that milking cattle would delay farming, that calves would starve to death, that no one would drink the milk, and that milking cows would be difficult to raise.

In order to promote the comprehensive utilization of cattle for service, milk, and breeding quickly and well, the Siyang County Party Committee and the Party Committees of various communes took the following specific measures in addition to carrying out publicity in various ways to unify thinking: (1) Each commune has a secretary in charge to strengthen leadership; (2) Short-term training courses for milkers, breeders, and dairy product processors were set up to impart technology; (3) Advanced breeding and milking experiences were promoted in a timely manner, using practical examples to break the masses' concerns and conservative ideas. In communes such as Peiwei, each cattle can produce six or seven catties of milk per day, and the highest can reach more than 20 catties. According to tests, the quality of the milk is very high. The fat content of yellow cow milk is 5-7%, and the fat content of buffalo milk is as high as 8-12%, while the fat content of ordinary Dutch milk cows is only about 3.5%. In communes such as Xinyuan, the method of "more labor for less milk, more milk for less labor, and full labor for stopped milk production" was adopted for milking cattle, making the milking cattle more efficient in autumn sowing than before, and the milk production did not decrease.

On the basis of the widespread promotion of cattle milking in various communes, dairy product processing factories were established in October and November. This kind of small-scale dairy product factory can be set up for as little as forty or fifty yuan.

Jiangsu provincial leading organs attach great importance to the experience of Siyang people in promoting cattle milking and flat-bottomed pot condensed milk. Recently, a field meeting was held in Siyang County, calling on the province to vigorously promote it.

    综合利用耕牛提高经济价值
    泗阳社社办耕牛役、乳、繁综合利用场
    本报讯  江苏泗阳县在两个月里，社社办起耕牛役、乳、繁综合利用场和乳制品加工厂。现在，这个县二十七个公社所有的敬老院的老人，幼儿院的小孩和体弱社员，每天都吃到新鲜牛奶。乳品厂已将剩余鲜奶加工成炼乳、奶粉、奶油、乳糖和酪胶等七种乳制品。
    泗阳县今年粮食棉花获得空前的全面大丰收。因而从根本上改变了老灾区的贫困面貌。为了促进农业生产的更大跃进，满足人民物质生活不断提高的需要，县委决定在全县范围内，大搞耕牛役、乳、繁综合利用。争取在三年内，使耕牛从现有三万多头，再来一个更大的飞跃，使吃牛奶的人从现有老人、小孩到所有需要的人。
    用本地黄牛、水牛挤奶，在泗阳县的历史上是空前的。在开始推行耕牛挤奶的时候，许多群众有顾虑。他们怕本地土牛挤不出奶，怕耕牛挤奶误了耕种，怕饿死小牛，怕挤出奶来没人喝，怕挤奶的牛难饲养。
    为了又快又好地推广耕牛役、乳、繁综合利用工作，泗阳县委和各公社党委除通过各种方式进行宣传，统一思想外，采取了下列几项具体措施：（1）每个公社都有一个书记挂帅，以加强领导；（2）开办挤奶员、饲养员、奶品加工员短期训练班，传授技术；（3）及时推广先进的饲养和挤奶经验，用实际事例，打破群众的顾虑和保守思想。裴圩等公社，每头耕牛每天能挤奶六、七斤，最高的达二十多斤。据化验，奶的质量很高，黄牛奶含脂率为5—7％，水牛奶含脂率高达8—12％，而一般荷兰奶牛奶的含脂率只有3.5％左右。新元等公社，对挤奶的耕牛采取“奶多少耕，奶少多耕，停产满耕”的办法，使挤奶耕牛，在秋种中比原来工作效率还要高，挤奶量也没降低。
    各个公社在普遍推广了耕牛挤奶的基础上，又在10、11月份纷纷办起了乳制品加工工厂。这种小型乳制品厂，只要四、五十元就可以办起来。
    江苏省级领导机关，十分重视泗阳人民推行耕牛挤奶和平锅炼乳的经验，最近在泗阳县召开了现场会议，号召全省大力推广。
