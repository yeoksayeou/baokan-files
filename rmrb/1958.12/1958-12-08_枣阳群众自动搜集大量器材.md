Zao Yang Masses Automatically Collect Large Quantities of Equipment

(Reported by this newspaper) The Zao Yang County in Hubei Province relied on its own efforts to solve the problem of insufficient equipment for building water conservancy projects. In order to complete the plan for building water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, the relevant departments of Zao Yang County sent cadres to purchase equipment everywhere a long time ago. However, the things they bought back were far from meeting the needs. According to calculations, there was still a shortage of more than 3,000 tons of cement, more than 150 tons of explosives, and more than 22,000 sections of cement culvert pipes. Steel, steel bars, pig iron, and timber were also in short supply. In addition, there was a lack of a batch of tools for digging and transporting earth. Under such circumstances, some communes "lost heart" and prepared to stop some water conservancy projects.

The Zao Yang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to this situation, mobilized the masses to conduct a great debate on the questions of "is it right not to build without equipment, can we produce equipment ourselves, and can local materials replace foreign materials?" and educated everyone with the achievements of the national steel and iron smelting campaign, criticizing the ideas of "only relying on conditions" and "reaching out to higher authorities for help." In the debate, the masses posted more than 250,000 big-character posters, and according to local conditions, tapped potentials and found several ways to solve the shortage of equipment. First, mobilize the masses to build water conservancy equipment themselves. Run factories on the construction sites, produce locally, and use locally. Now, more than 100 various water conservancy equipment processing factories have been established throughout the county, with more than 15,000 people engaged in production. By the end of November, in nearly a month, the county had produced 1,800 tons of cement, 200,000 tons of lime, more than 70,000 sections of culvert pipes, and 10 tons of explosives. Second, mobilize the masses to collect various materials and carry out purchases. As of November 25, the county had purchased 97 tons of scrap steel and iron, and tens of thousands of kilograms of bamboo. In addition, some surplus raw materials such as steel bars and cement were cleared from financial and economic enterprises. Third, economize on materials, use local materials, and replace foreign materials with local materials. For example, using rock to build tunnels instead of reinforced concrete water diversion culverts for the Huayang River Reservoir can save 90 tons of steel bars and 920 tons of cement. The Shahe Reservoir used the formwork for making culvert pipes to be dismantled and converted into earth railway tracks and earth-carrying vehicles, which can save 400 cubic feet of wood. Some reservoir construction sites also saved a lot of materials by using tree bark instead of hemp rope and other methods.

After solving the difficulty of insufficient equipment by the above methods, the communes that were originally preparing to stop some water conservancy projects no longer stopped.

### 枣阳群众自动搜集大量器材

    就地取材  就地加工
    群策群力  兴建水利
    枣阳群众自动搜集大量器材
    本报讯  湖北省枣阳县自力更生，解决了兴修水利器材不足的困难。为了完成今冬明春兴修水利工程的计划，很早以前，枣阳县有关部门就派出干部到各处采购器材，但是，买回来的东西，远远不能满足需要。据计算尚差水泥三千多吨，炸药一百五十多吨，水泥剅管二万二千多节。钢材、钢筋、生铁和木材等也还差许多。此外还缺乏一批挖土、运土的工具。在这种情况下，有的公社就“打退堂鼓”，准备停修一部分水利工程。
    中共枣阳县委针对这一情况，发动群众，就“没有器材就不修对不对、自己能不能生产器材、土材料能不能代替洋材料”等问题进行了大鸣大放大辩论，并以全民炼钢炼铁的成就教育大家，批判了“唯条件论”和“伸手向上要”的思想。在辩论中，群众共贴出大字报二十五万多张，根据当地情况，挖出了潜力，找出了好几种解决器材不足的办法。第一，发动群众自己大造水利器材。在工地上大办工厂，就地生产，就地使用。现在全县已经办起各种水利器材加工厂一百多处，有一万五千多人投入生产。到11月下旬止，近一个月时间，全县共生产了水泥一千八百吨、石灰二十万吨、剅管七万多节、炸药十吨。第二，发动群众搜集各种材料，进行收购。到11月25日止，全县已收购了废钢铁九十七吨，竹子几万斤。此外还从财经企业部门清理出一部分剩余的钢筋、水泥等原材料。第三，节约用料，就地取材，以土代洋。例如华阳河水库用岩石打隧洞代替钢筋水泥输水涵管，可节约钢筋九十吨，水泥九百二十吨。沙河水库利用做涵管的模板，拆下来改做土铁路轨道和运土车等，便可节约木板四百方丈。有的水库工地，采取用树皮代替麻绳等办法，也节省了大量材料。
    用以上几种办法解决了器材不足的困难后，原来准备停修一部分水利工程的公社也不停修了。
