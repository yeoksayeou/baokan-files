    Eight Hours Better Than Twelve Hours
    By Our Correspondent, Bao Ming
    According to general understanding, more people and longer working hours naturally lead to more output; fewer people and shorter hours mean less output. However, the Party Branch Secretary of the Wuhan Meat संयुक्त Processing Plant's feeding workshop told me the opposite: Last year, twenty-four people fed two thousand pigs, working twelve, even fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and were still overwhelmed. The mortality rate of live pigs reached 0.15%, and the qualification rate after slaughter was only 90%. This year, seven people feed two thousand pigs, working eight hours a day, or ten hours at most when they are busy, but they are much more relaxed. The mortality rate has dropped to 0.02%, and the qualification rate has risen to 98%.
    He said that when the proposal to reduce working hours from twelve to eight was first put forward, everyone asked for more people. Only Yang Minghua (a Party member), a feeder, suggested improving labor organization and reducing the number of people to sixteen. The opinions were sharply opposed. The Party Branch mobilized the masses to debate, and only one old worker agreed to reduce the number of people, while the majority believed that "live pigs are difficult to care for" and still advocated increasing the number of people. Later, they experimented in Yang Minghua's group, and as a result, sixteen people working eight hours a day reduced the mortality rate to 0.04%. While the masses were generally learning from the work experience of Yang Minghua's group, Liu Changrong (a Party member) suggested reducing the number of people to twelve. Yang Mingsheng (a Party member), Huang Youde, Wang Heqiu, and others further suggested reducing it to seven and took the lead in successful experimentation. Therefore, the entire workshop quickly achieved seven people feeding two thousand pigs, working eight hours a day.
    Why is it that fewer people and shorter hours result in higher work efficiency than more people and longer hours? In summary, they mainly made three reforms: First, in the past, the receiving, feeding, and waiting-for-slaughter processes belonged to their respective work sections and did not cooperate with each other. As a result, the receiving process did not screen out all the sick pigs and sent them to the feeding warehouse. The feeders had to classify the pigs according to white, mottled, and black hair, and also screen out sick pigs, making the work very stressful. If the feeders didn't screen out all the sick pigs, the waiting-for-slaughter process wouldn't accept them, and the two sides argued, wasting time. They combined these three processes into one work section and organized "one-stop" cooperation. When the receiving group inspected the pigs, they carefully screened out the sick pigs. At the same time, when the live pigs were weighed, they were classified according to coat color before being sent to the warehouse. This didn't take much effort, but it greatly reduced the burden on the feeders, and live pigs had fewer opportunities to be infected with diseases. Second, in the past, they used broken rice and bran to cook refined feed for the pigs. The feed for tens of thousands of pigs was centrally cooked in the feed work section and transported by seventy-two small carts. As a result, there were too many carts and too little space, and the gate was broken down and could not supply enough feed. The feeders often came at three or four in the morning to wait for pig feed, but the pigs didn't start eating until seven o'clock. They learned from the advanced experience of East China and changed to using green grass fermented into green feed to feed the pigs, and built fermentation tanks near each warehouse, which not only saved grain but also eliminated the phenomenon of coming early to wait for feed, and reduced the workers transporting feed. Third, although there were many people in the group in the past, the internal division of labor was unreasonable and the operating methods were unreasonable, so everyone was very tired and the efficiency was not high. They improved the internal labor organization and operating methods, and at the same time, everyone could rest well with eight hours of work a day, and their energy was abundant when they went to work, so work efficiency was significantly improved. As a result of their implementation, the entire workshop was reduced from seven work sections to two work sections, and from nine hundred and thirty-two people to three hundred and fifty-eight people, and also established green feed, sugar production, animal husbandry, and paper making factories. In November of this year, more than 206,000 pigs were brought in, the most pigs brought in in a month since the factory was built, but their mortality rate of live pigs was further reduced to 0.013%.
    The experience of this workshop shows that as long as we mobilize the masses to innovate technology and rationally use labor, even if the number of people is reduced and working hours are shortened, labor productivity will still be significantly improved. During the Great Leap Forward, the masses put forward a slogan called "Hard work plus clever work, production doubles and triples." That is to say, in addition to hard work, we must also work cleverly, find the knack, tap the potential, and work cleverly in order to achieve the goal of increasing production by multiples and folds. At present, to ensure that the masses can eat their fill, sleep well, rest well, and produce well, and to ensure that the eight-hour work system is restored while production continues to leap forward, we need to put in effort on the word "clever."

    八小时比十二小时
    本报记者  葆铭
    按照一般的理解，人多、工作时间长，自然会多出活；人少、时间短，就少出活。但是，武汉肉类联合加工厂饲养车间的支部书记却向我讲了个相反的情况：他们去年二十四人饲养两千头猪，每天工作十二小时，甚至十四小时、十六小时，还忙乱不堪，生猪死亡率达0.15％，屠宰后的合格率只有90％。今年七个人养两千头猪，每天工作八小时，最忙十个小时，却搞的很轻快，死亡率降为0.02％，合格率升为98％。
    他说，当年初提出将工作时间由十二小时缩短为八小时的时候，大家都要求增加人，唯有饲养工杨明华（党员）却建议改进劳动组织，把人减为十六人，意见正是针锋相对。支部发动群众辩论，结果也只有一个老工人同意减人，而多数人认为“生猪难侍弄”，仍然主张增加人。后来，他们就在杨明华这个小组试验，结果做到十六个人每天工作八小时，死亡率还降为0.04％。在群众普遍学习杨明华这个组的工作经验中，刘昌荣（党员）又建议将人数减为十二人，杨明盛（党员）和黄友德、王和球等人更进一步建议减为七人，并带头试验成功。所以，全车间很快就做到了七人养两千头猪，每天工作八小时。
    为什么人少时间短比人多时间长的工作效率还高呢？概括起来，他们主要作了三个改革：一是过去接运、饲养和候宰工序各属各的工段，互不协作，结果接运工序没有把病猪全部剔出，就送到饲养仓库，饲养工既要按白毛、花毛、黑毛猪分类，又要选剔病猪，弄得工作很紧张。饲养工没把病猪剔尽，候宰工序又不收，双方争执不下，耽误时间。他们将这三个工序并为一个工段，组织“一条龙”协作。接运组在验收时，就仔细将病猪剔尽，同时在生猪过磅时，按毛色分类，然后才送进仓库。他们这样做并不费事，但却大大地减轻了饲养工的负担，而生猪受疾病传染的机会也更少。二是过去他们用碎米、糠皮煮成精饲料喂猪，几万头猪的饲料集中在饲料工段煮好，用七十二辆小车推送。这样，车多地方小，把门挤破了也供应不过来。饲养工们常常早晨三四点钟就来等猪食，而猪却要七点钟才开始喂。他们学习华东先进经验，改用青草发酵成青饲料喂猪，并把发酵池建在各个仓库附近，这样既节约了粮食，又消除了老早就来等饲料的现象，并且减去了推送饲料的工人。三是过去组里虽然人多，但内部分工不合理，操作方法不合理，结果大家很累，效率还不高。他们改进了组内劳动组织和操作方法，同时实行每天八小时工作大家能休息好，上班时精力充沛，工效就显著提高了。他们这样实行的结果，全车间就由七个工段并为两个工段，由九百三十二人减为三百五十八人，还办起了青饲料、制醣、畜牧、造纸等工厂。今年11月进猪二十万六千多头，是建厂以来进猪最多的一月，但他们的生猪死亡率却更进一步降为0.013％。
    这个车间的经验说明了，只要我们发动群众革新技术，合理使用劳动力，尽管人减少了，劳动时间缩短了，而劳动生产率还显著提高。在大跃进中，群众提出了一个口号，叫做“苦干加巧干，生产翻几番”。这就是说，除了苦干，还必须巧干，必须找窍门，挖潜力，干的巧，才能达到生产论倍成番地增长的目的。当前要做到群众能吃饱、睡好、休息好而生产也好，要做到恢复八小时工作制而生产还不断跃进，就需要在这“巧”字上面下功夫。
