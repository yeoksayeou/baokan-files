Our era is an era where one day equals twenty years, but for the minority nationalities in our country, one year equals a thousand years. For thousands of years, the Dong people of Sanjiang, Guangxi, have lived a life of scarcity, lacking both food and clothing, suffering from hunger and cold. After liberation, people's lives gradually improved, but every year 400,000 person-times of labor were still needed to transport grain from other places. After a year of the Great Leap Forward, they have become a "four surplus county" with surpluses of grain, oil, meat, and money! In the past, the Lisu people of the Nujiang River in Yunnan relied on wild vegetables to survive the winter, but this year they have so much grain that they need to build new warehouses to store it. In terms of culture, many minority nationalities have changed from the backward state of carving wood and tying knots, and a new atmosphere of poems covering the walls has emerged! In our country, quite a few ethnic autonomous regions have undergone such earth-shaking changes. This change shows that the socialist system and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are the fundamental guarantees for the high-speed development of all ethnic groups.

Only with ideological harvest can there be productive harvest. The speed of the Great Leap Forward of the minority nationalities depends first and foremost on the changes in their ideological outlook. Only by winning the battle on the ideological front can there be a great victory on the production front. Those "regional backwardness theories," "regional exceptionalism theories," and the passive dependency thinking of relying on state assistance are the main obstacles on the road forward. Once these ideas are broken, people get rid of superstition, liberate their minds, and an earth-shattering drive is brought into play. After a year of hard work, the backward appearance has been changed.

China was poor and blank. Generally speaking, minority areas are poorer and blanker. This is a bad thing, but it is also a good thing. Because they are poorer and blanker, the people of minority nationalities are more urgently demanding to change the pain of being poor and blank. Mobilizing the masses to change this poor and blank life will draw the newest and most beautiful pictures and write the newest and most beautiful words. We cannot cling to the "backwardness theory" and fail to find ways to change backwardness.

State assistance is an important aspect of promoting the development and progress of minority nationalities. In the past, the state vigorously helped minority nationalities develop their economic and cultural undertakings, and will continue to do so in the present and future. But it would not be good to regard reliance on state assistance as the only way to change poverty and blankness, rather than striving for self-reliance while receiving state assistance. Passive dependency thinking is a stumbling block to the Great Leap Forward.

The great victories on the production front of the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County and other advanced minority areas are a good example of the high-speed Great Leap Forward of minority nationalities in our country. Let us learn from their spirit of self-reliance and hard work while receiving state assistance, so that all ethnic groups in our motherland can advance side by side and leap forward together!

    先要消除思想障碍
    我们的时代是一天等于二十年的时代，但是，对于我国的少数民族来说，却是一年等于千百年，广西三江的侗族人民千百年来一直过着少吃缺穿，挨冻受饿的日子。解放后，人们生活逐渐改善，但是每年仍需要四十万人次的劳动力到外地运粮。经过一年的跃进，他们已经成为粮、油、肉、钱样样有余的“四余县”了！云南怒江傈僳族人民过去是靠野菜过冬的，而今年则粮食多得要造新仓库来放了。在文化方面许多少数民族已经改变了刻木结绳的落后状态，出现诗歌满墙的新气象了！在我们的国家里，已经有相当多的民族自治地方，起了这样翻天复地的大变化。这个变化说明，社会主义制度，和中国共产党的领导是各民族人民高速度发展的根本保证。
    只有思想丰收，才有生产丰收。各少数民族人民跃进的速度，首先取决于他们思想面貌的变化，只有在思想战线上打了胜仗，才有生产战线上的巨大胜利。那些“地区落后论”、“地区特殊论”和消极依靠国家帮助的依赖思想，是前进途中的主要障碍。这些思想一经打破，人们破除了迷信，解放了思想，冲天干劲就发挥出来了。经过一年苦战，改变了落后面貌。
    中国是一穷二白的。在中国的领土上，一般说，少数民族地区则更穷更白。这是坏事，但也正是好事。因为更穷更白，少数民族人民就更迫切地要求改变穷白的痛苦。发动群众起来改变这穷白的痛苦生活，就会画出最新最美的图画，写出最新最美的文字。不能死抱住“落后论”，不去设法改变落后。
    国家的帮助，是促使少数民族发展进步的一个重要方面。国家过去大力帮助了少数民族发展经济文化事业，现在和将来也会继续帮助下去。但是如果把依靠国家帮助当作改变一穷二白的唯一办法，而不是在国家帮助的同时努力自力更生，那就不好了。消极的依赖思想，是跃进的绊脚石。
    三江侗族自治县和其他先进的少数民族地区在生产战线上的大捷，是我国少数民族高速度跃进的良好榜样。让我们学习他们在国家帮助下同时自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，使我们祖国各民族，并驾齐驱，齐步跃进！
