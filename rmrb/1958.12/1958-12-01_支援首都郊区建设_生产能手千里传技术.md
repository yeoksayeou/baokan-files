    Supporting the Construction of the Capital's Suburbs
    Skilled Workers Travel Thousands of Miles to Transmit Technology
    (Our report) In order to assist the suburbs of Beijing to quickly realize rope-drawn mechanization and methane gasification, rope-drawn machine work teams and methane gas demonstration teams from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have recently arrived in Beijing. The methane gas demonstration team from Fuyang County, Anhui Province, gave its first wonderful performance at the Chaoyang People's Commune in the eastern suburbs of Beijing a few days ago. The rope-drawn machine work team sent by Jiangsu Province is actively preparing, and will soon meet with the commune members in the suburbs of Beijing.
    The members of these demonstration teams and work teams are mostly the most famous creators and users of advanced tools in their local areas. They will adopt the methods of guaranteed teaching and learning, mutual teaching and learning, and mobile performances to impart technology. The entire set of methods for methane gas extraction, storage, transportation, and use demonstrated by the methane gas demonstration team are applicable to the conditions in the suburbs of Beijing.
    Some time ago, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing encountered some difficulties in promoting rope-drawn machines and the use of methane gas, and the progress of the work was not very smooth. After learning about this situation, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Fuyang County Committee of Anhui Province immediately sent these work teams and demonstration teams to assist the work in the capital.

    生产能手千里传技术
    本报讯  为协助北京市郊区迅速实现绳索牵引机化、沼气化，江苏省和安徽省的绳索牵引机工作队和沼气表演队最近已到达北京。安徽省阜阳县的沼气表演队前几天在北京东郊朝阳人民公社已经作了第一场精彩表演。江苏省派来的绳索牵引机工作队正在积极筹备，不久也将和京郊社员们见面。
    这些表演队、工作队的成员，大都是当地最有名的先进工具的创造者和使用者，他们将采用包教包学、互教互学、巡回表演的办法传授技术。沼气表演队表演的沼气取、储、运、用等一整套作法都适用于北京郊区的情况。
    前些时京郊农民由于在推广绳索牵引机和沼气使用中遇到一些困难，工作进展不很顺利。中共江苏省委和安徽省阜阳县委了解到这种情况后，立即派出这些工作队、表演队来协助首都工作。
