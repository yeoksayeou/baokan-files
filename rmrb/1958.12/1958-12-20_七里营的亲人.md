In the office of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Henan, we met three comrades who looked like peasants. As soon as we met, they rushed to say, "You must go and see the Qiliying Commune, see the cotton in the commune, and see the streets of Qiliying. Hey, it's just like a city... ." Their words revealed their infinite pride in the construction achievements of Qiliying. We originally thought they were members of the Qiliying People's Commune, but later learned that they were cadres from the First Ministry of Machinery Industry who had been sent to Qiliying for labor training. These days, they are gathering in the county, waiting for the organization to assign them work uniformly.

We arrived at the Qiliying Commune. The roads in Qiliying are flat and clean, comparable to asphalt roads, and the small ditches on both sides of the road are as neatly cut as with a knife. The walls on both sides of the road are painted snow-white, covered with poems and paintings. Walking on such a street, we couldn't help but praise it. The comrades in the commune said that not long ago, this road was still uneven and very dirty. The sent-down cadres took the lead in repairing the road and came up with ideas to beautify the streets. In a few days, it became what it is now. We walked into the courtyard of the commune office and saw a sign for the Red and Expert University hanging in the courtyard. When we asked about the Red and Expert University, the topic turned to the sent-down cadres again. The comrades in the commune told us that the vice-principal and dean of this university are both sent-down comrades, and 11 or 12 of the 17 departments have teachers who are sent-down cadres. Comrade Dong Daoguang, who introduced the situation to us, is also a student at this school. He is studying literature and said that he was encouraged to engage in creative writing with the help of the sent-down comrades. We went to visit the commune's repair shop and found that this factory was also built with the help of the sent-down cadres. When asked about the commune's steelmaking situation, it turned out that everything from setting up the furnace to pouring molten iron was done by the sent-down cadres. After the sent-down cadres left, the cadres and workers they trained continued to fight on the steel front... . We saw so many new things in Qiliying, and we couldn't find anything that didn't have the hard work of the sent-down cadres!

We went to the commune's Red Flag Canteen for dinner, which is a large canteen where more than 800 people eat. In the canteen office, there was a menu posted that promised no repetition of dishes for a week. In the elderly dining hall, neat red lacquered square tables were arranged. Before mealtime, the master chefs brought out dishes specially made for the elderly. In the mother and child dining hall, there were rows of low tables and small stools. The rice bowls in the young and middle-aged restaurant were also covered with thick "cotton jackets." The canteen courtyard was full of big-character posters praising the cooks and offering mutual suggestions. It is said that since the establishment of this canteen (July), the rice has never been half-cooked or burnt, and the steamed buns have never had too much or too little alkali. We praised the good management of the canteen, but the quartermaster, Lu Shuxin, praised his "advisor," the sent-down cadre Liu Wenhan. Liu Wenhan worked in the fields during the day, and in the evening, he went to be Lu Shuxin's "advisor," studying this plan and that system, often until late at night. With so many people eating, a month or two ago, grain still had to be rationed. How could we ensure that everyone was full without wasting grain, and that it was fair and reasonable? This was not a simple matter. Just how much rice to cook for each meal and how to distribute the cooked rice to everyone was a difficult problem. Liu Wenhan helped everyone come up with ideas and formulated forms and systems. The cooks worked very actively, but some people did not trust them and said things behind their backs, so the cooks got angry and quit. Liu Wenhan suggested holding a commune member meeting to criticize those who spoke irresponsibly. The elderly people complained that it was inconvenient to eat in the canteen, so Liu Wenhan immediately discussed it with the commune cadres and decided to set up a separate small stove for the elderly... . Lu Shuxin talked to us for almost two hours and had not finished introducing all the ideas that his "advisor" had given him.

An old woman holding a child heard that we were from the county and asked us head-on, "Did you see Lao Yang in the county?" She invited us into her house to sit down and told us. Lao Yang's name is Yang Dekun, the sent-down female cadre who runs the Red and Expert University. She lived in her house for several months... . Suddenly, she nudged her daughter sitting next to her and pointed to us, saying, "Look, they are all wearing cotton shoes. Beijing is probably colder than here. Make a pair of cotton shoes for Lao Yang to take with them." During the conversation, the old woman kept sighing. We asked her if she was feeling unwell. Her daughter shook her head and said, "Mother feels bad whenever Lao Yang is mentioned. These days, she wakes up from her dreams at night, mumbling, 'I don't know when I will see Lao Yang again.'" We jokingly asked the old woman, "Why do you miss Lao Yang so much?" The old woman was not happy when she heard this. She said, "Look at what you're asking. If you leave home, wouldn't your mother miss you?" Before she finished speaking, the old men and old women who came to visit us one after another started talking. They said that sent-down cadres are different from ordinary workers. They eat and live with the commune members, and work with everyone, just like family members. The old women and old men really treat the sent-down cadres as their own children. There is an old woman named Lei Wuyun in the Xiaoji Production Team. When she learned that Niu Yuwen, the sent-down cadre living in her house, might be sent to the frontier, she took the time to sew a small pocket, like bidding farewell to children about to leave their hometown, and filled it with "soil from the cooking stove" from her home. She handed the pocket to Niu Yuwen and told her, "This is the soil of your hometown. Eat a little of it after you go to the frontier, and you won't be unaccustomed to the water and soil." When we saw this old woman Lei, she kept praising her "daughter" who was about to travel far, saying that she could really endure hardships and worked like a man. What the old woman couldn't forget was this incident: One spring evening, the temperature suddenly dropped. To prevent frost, Niu Yuwen stayed up all night watching the thermometer. At dawn, the temperature dropped to zero. Niu Yuwen immediately rang the bell to warn everyone, and the commune members mobilized to prevent frost, and the crops in the team suffered no damage. Afterwards, everyone asked each other: Which commune member was so conscientious and responsible? Old woman Lei Wuyun told us that she was really reluctant to let Niu Yuwen leave. She ran to ask the cadres to keep Niu Yuwen, but the cadres said "no." She also planned to find a marriage partner for Niu Yuwen, but it didn't work out. At this time, Niu Yuwen had been gone for more than ten days, and she still念念不忘 (niàn niàn bù wàng - always remembering in one's mind) said: It would be great if Niu Yuwen could be sent back to us.

In the commune's guesthouse, the commune chief, Wang Wensheng, said that after the sent-down cadres left, the masses felt that there was one less person in their family, and the cadres felt that there was one less arm to help them with their work. He told us that when these comrades first came, they were naturally not used to anything. Their hands blistered from work, and they couldn't turn over in bed at night. Yang Dekun, who later worked very well, went to cut cotton bolls when she first came. After a day of cutting, all the seams of her fingers were worn out and bleeding. The next day, she wrapped her fingers with cloth strips and silently continued to work as usual. They were so determined and worked so "破份 (pò fèn - reckless)," and after a while, you couldn't tell the difference between the commune members and the sent-down cadres. Chief Wang told us: These comrades are peasants, but not just peasants; they are not cadres, but they are the most capable cadres. No matter what the task is, as long as the Party puts it forward, they take the lead and actively do propaganda, and serve as advisors and come up with ideas for the cadres. Wang Wensheng told us about such a thing: When the large-scale steelmaking began, the Party committee was extremely nervous, only focusing on fighting hard to produce the first furnace of molten iron, and had not yet had time to arrange propaganda work. However, the sound of gongs and drums came from the steelmaking site. The sent-down cadres who did not participate in steelmaking immediately composed 快板 (kuài bǎn - a form of rhythmic storytelling),活报剧 (huó bào jù - living newspaper plays), and 相声 (xiàng sheng - cross-talk) as soon as they returned from the fields, and automatically went to the furnace to do mobilization work. The steelmaking was done day and night, and their propaganda was done day and night.

The sent-down cadres built Qiliying as if they were building their own hometown, and the people of Qiliying also regarded the sent-down cadres as their own relatives. In the days after the news of the sent-down cadres leaving, people felt like they had a stone pressed on their hearts. On the night before the sent-down cadres left, some people didn't close their eyes all night, listening for any movement. The Young Pioneer Du Xingduo repeatedly told his mother before going to bed to wake him up early. In order not to affect production, the commune originally did not allow everyone to see them off, but many commune members secretly went to see them off. Even Zhang Guoting, who had the best labor discipline, violated the commune's decision for the first time and went to see off the sent-down cadres. People had more than a thousand words in their hearts, but no one spoke. Everyone just looked at each other with tears in their eyes. Chief Wang, this old cadre who had been tested in long-term struggles, had previously instructed everyone to see them off happily and not to cry, but when he delivered a farewell speech to the sent-down cadres, he started crying first. When the sent-down comrades waved goodbye to everyone with their luggage on their backs, in the midst of the noise, someone suddenly said in a trembling voice, "Don't worry, I will definitely work hard... ." It turned out that this was Li Chengzhang, a member of the Sixth Team. He was not content with agricultural production in the past and ran to the city to find a job. Last winter, he heard that cadres were sent down to work, and he thought to himself that college students were coming to build their hometown, so what reason did he have to escape labor? Soon he honestly participated in agricultural production.

At night, every house in the Qiliying People's Commune was brightly lit with electric lights, and the song "Socialism is Good" was broadcast from the loudspeakers. The song accompanied the young people to the "Red and Expert University." They seemed to be talking about something? Maybe they were reminiscing about the just-departed principal and teachers. The old people were holding children returning from kindergarten, and the children were chattering, perhaps asking when the aunts who taught singing and dancing would come back?

    七里营的亲人
    马超卿  杜兴河
    在河南新乡地委组织部的办公室里，我们遇见三个农民模样的同志，一见面他们便抢着说：“你们一定要去看看七里营公社，看看社里的棉花，看看七里营的街道，嘿，那简直像城市了……。”言语之间，流露出对七里营建设成就的无限自豪。原以为他们是七里营人民公社的社员，后来才知道他们是第一机械工业部下放到七里营劳动锻炼的干部。这几天他们正在县里集中，等待组织统一分配工作。
    我们到了七里营公社。七里营的马路平坦整洁，可以和柏油路比美，路两边的小水沟修得像刀切过一样。马路两边，墙壁粉刷得雪白，上边满是诗画。走在这样的街上，我们不由得赞不绝口。社里的同志说，不久前，这条路还高低不平，很不干净，下放干部们带头修路，出主意美化街道，几天工夫，就变成了这个样子。我们走进公社办公室的院子，院子里挂着红专大学的牌子，一问起红专大学，话题又转到下放干部身上。社里的同志告诉我们，这个大学的副校长、教务长都是下放同志担任，十七个系里，有十一、二个系的教员都是下放干部。向我们介绍情况的董道光同志也是这个学校的学生，他在学文学，他说，他是在下放同志的帮助下才鼓起了搞创作的勇气的。我们去参观公社的修配厂，发现这个厂也是在下放干部的帮助下建设起来的。问起社里炼钢铁的情况，那更是从盘炉到流出铁水，都是下放干部一手搞起的，下放干部走了，他们培养出的干部和工人还继续在钢铁战线上战斗……。我们在七里营看了那么多新鲜事物，找不到有哪一件事里没有下放干部的心血！
    我们到公社的红旗食堂吃饭，这是个有八百多人吃饭的大食堂。食堂的办公室里贴着一星期不吃重样饭的饭单。老人饭厅里摆着整整齐齐的红漆方桌，开饭时间不到，大师傅就端上了特为老人们做的饭菜。母子食堂里一排排矮桌小凳，青壮年餐厅里的饭缸也都穿上了厚厚的“棉袄”。食堂院子里贴满了表扬炊事员和互相提意见的大字报。据说，这个食堂从成立（7月）到现在，饭从来没有夹生或焦糊过，馒头从来没有碱大碱小过。我们称赞食堂管理工作做得好，司务长吕书新却向我们称赞他的“参谋”下放干部刘文翰。刘文翰白天下地干活，一到晚上，就去给吕书新当“参谋”，研究这样的计划那样的制度，常常一直搞到深夜。这么多人吃饭，一两个月前，粮食还要定量供应，怎么样才能既让大家吃饱又不浪费粮食，还要做到公平合理，这真不是一件简单的事，单只每顿饭下多少米，饭做熟了怎么分给大家，就是一个难煞人的问题。刘文翰帮助大家出了主意，制定了表格和制度。炊事员干得很积极，有些人却不信任他们，背后随便乱说，炊事员赌气不干了。刘文翰就建议召开社员大会批评那些不负责任乱说话的人。老人们嫌在食堂吃饭不方便，刘文翰马上和社干部商量，决定给老人们另设小灶……。吕书新给我们谈了差不多两个小时，还没有把他的“参谋”给他出的主意介绍完。
    一位抱着孩子的老大娘听说我们是从县里来的，迎面就问：“你们在县里看见老杨没有？”她一边招待我们进屋里坐，一边给我们讲。老杨叫杨德坤，就是办红专大学的那位下放女干部，在她家住过好几个月，……突然她把坐在身旁的女儿碰了一下，指着我们对她说：“你看他们都穿的棉鞋，北京大概比这里冷，给老杨做一双棉鞋捎去吧。”在谈话中，老大娘不断唉声叹气，我们问她哪里不舒服吗？她女儿摇摇头说：“一提老杨娘就不好受，这几天晚上做梦醒来，也念叨着：不知哪一天才能见到老杨。”我们半开玩笑地问老大娘：“你为什么那么想老杨？”这一问老人家可不高兴了，她说：“看你问的，你离家走了，你妈妈不想吗？”话未落音，先后进来探望我们的老大爷老大娘，就你一言我一语地说开了。他们说下放干部和一般工作人员不一样，他们和社员一起吃、一起住，跟大伙一起干活，就像家里人一样。老大娘老大爷们的确是把下放干部当做自己的亲儿女看待。小冀生产队有一位雷伍云大娘，当她知道住在她家里的下放干部牛玉文有可能被派到边疆去的时候，像送别将要远离家乡的儿女一样，赶紧抽空缝了一个小口袋，里边装上家里的“锅台土”。她把口袋递给牛玉文，告诉她说：“这是家乡土，到边疆后吃一点，就不会不服水土了。”当我们看到这位雷老大娘时，她还不停地向我们夸奖她这位将有远行的“女儿”，说她真能吃苦，干起活来像个男子汉。特别使老大娘不能忘记的是这样的一件事：春天的一个晚上，气温突然下降。为了防霜，牛玉文通夜不睡守着寒暑表。黎明时候，气温一下降到零度。牛玉文马上敲钟报警，社员们闻警一齐出动防霜，队里的庄稼一点没受损失。事后，大家互相询问：是哪位社员办事这样认真负责？雷伍云大娘告诉我们，她实在舍不得让牛玉文走，她跑去要求干部要留下牛玉文，干部说“不中”。她还打算给牛玉文说亲，也没有说成。这时候牛玉文离开已经十来天了，她还念念不忘地说：要是能把牛玉文给我们送回来就好了。
    在公社招待所里，社长王文生说，下放干部走了以后，群众的感觉是家里少了一口人，干部的感觉是工作上少了一条膀子。他告诉我们，这些同志刚来的时候，自然什么都不习惯，干活手上打泡，晚上睡觉翻不过身来，那位后来劳动得很好的杨德坤，刚来就去剪棉花桃，一天剪下来，几个手指缝全磨出了血，第二天，她把手指缠上布条，不声不响地照样干。他们就是这样决心大，劳动起来“破份”（不顾一切的意思），过不多久，你就分不出那是社员那是下放干部了。王社长告诉我们：这些同志是农民，又不单纯是农民；不是干部，可又是最得力的干部。不论是什么任务，只要党一提出，他们就带头干，而且主动的做宣传，给干部当参谋出主意。王文生讲了这样一件事情：大搞钢铁开始的时候，党委紧张得要命，只顾为流出第一炉铁水而苦战，还没有来得及布置宣传工作。可是，炼铁工地上却传来了锣鼓声，没参加炼铁的下放干部从田间回来，立刻就编了快板、活报剧、相声，自动到炉边做鼓动工作。炼铁夜以继日，他们的宣传夜以继日。
    下放干部建设七里营，像建设自己的家乡一样，七里营的人民也把下放干部当做家里的亲人。下放干部要走的消息传来以后那几天，人们的心上像压上了石头。下放干部动身的头一天晚上，有些人通夜一眼未闭，老听着动静。少先队员杜兴铎睡觉前再三叮嘱他妈，早点叫醒他。为了不影响生产，社里本来不让大家去送行，可是很多社员都偷着去送行，连劳动纪律最好的张国亭也第一次违反了社里的决定，去送下放干部。人们心里何止千言万语，可是谁也不说话，大家只是含泪相视。王社长，这位经过长期斗争考验的老干部，事先，他嘱咐大家要高高兴兴地送行，不要哭，可是，当他向下放干部致辞告别的时候，自己却先哭了起来。当下放同志背着行李向大家挥手告别的时候，在一片吵杂声中，忽然有人用颤动的声音说：“你们放心吧，我一定好好劳动……。”原来这是六队社员李成章，他过去不安心农业生产，跑到城里找工作，去年冬天听说干部下放劳动，暗想大学生都来建设自己的家乡，自己有什么理由逃避劳动呢？不久他便老老实实参加农业生产了。
    夜晚，七里营人民公社家家电灯通亮，喇叭里传出“社会主义好”的歌曲，歌声伴送着年青人走向“红专大学”，他们好像在谈论着什么？也许在怀念着刚离别的校长和教员，老年人抱着从幼儿园回来的孩子，孩子们唧唧喳喳，也许在问奶奶爷爷教唱歌跳舞的那些阿姨什么时候才回来？（附图片）
