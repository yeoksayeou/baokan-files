　　Future Years Will Bring Even Richer Harvests
　　Summer comes, and the rice ripens into a yellow expanse,
　　The fields and paddies gleam with golden light,
　　Everyone sees it and their hearts are filled with joy,
　　The people's commune is busy with the harvest.
　　The rice ears bend like golden hooks,
　　Countless golden hooks nod in unison,
　　A golden sea stretches to the horizon,
　　The people's commune has another bumper harvest.
　　Harvest songs resound in the paddies,
　　Each person sings a different song,
　　Though the songs differ, their hearts are the same,
　　Every voice thanks Chairman Mao.
　　Singing mountain songs without end,
　　Like the eastward flowing river, never ceasing,
　　Forever following the Communist Party,
　　Future years will bring even richer harvests.
　　　　　　　　　　　Guangdong Chen Shicai

    今后年年更丰收夏来稻熟一片黄，满田满垌闪金光，人人看到心欢喜，人民公社收割忙。稻穗弯弯似金钩，线线金钩乱点头，天边一片黄金海，人民公社又丰收。丰收山歌响垌中，各人唱歌各不同，歌声不同心一样，声声感谢毛泽东。唱起山歌无尽头，江河东去水长流，永远跟着共产党，今后年年更丰收。
