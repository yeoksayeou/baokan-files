To solve the problem of agricultural product processing and meet the needs of the people's lives:
Jiangxi People's Commune vigorously develops light industry

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 27th dispatch) In the past two months, People's Communes in various parts of Jiangxi Province have established more than 36,000 light industrial factories. Since the autumn, due to Jiangxi's bumper harvest, a large number of agricultural products urgently need processing. At the same time, the broad masses of people have demanded a better supply of living materials. Under these dual pressures, Jiangxi's light industry was in a passive "sandwiched biscuit" situation.

What is the best way to develop light industry faster? Some people look upward, reaching out to ask higher authorities for labor, technical talent, capital, and equipment. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the experience of many regions, proposed: the large-scale development of light industry cannot rely solely on state investment; it must rely on the masses, rely on the communes, be self-reliant, start with indigenous methods, and move from indigenous to foreign methods. Therefore, on October 12, a provincial on-site conference on light industry was held in Boyang County to criticize the above-mentioned erroneous ideas and vigorously promote Boyang County's experience in relying on communes to vigorously develop light industry.

After the Boyang on-site conference, a high tide of vigorously developing light industry, centered on the large-scale establishment of agricultural product processing factories and comprehensive utilization factories, quickly swept through the People's Communes throughout the province. In the Gannan Administrative Region, the 97 People's Communes in seven counties, including Longnan and Guangchang, established more than 6,000 agricultural product processing factories for sweet potatoes and other products all at once. The People's Communes in counties such as Hukou, Duchang, and Jiujiang in the Jiujiang Special Region have newly established more than 12,000 agricultural product processing factories and comprehensive utilization factories for vegetable oil, feed, rice milling, sweet potatoes, wild plants, soybeans, food, leather, combs, and so on. From mid-October to the present, in just over two months, People's Communes across the province have newly established a total of more than 36,000 agricultural product processing factories and comprehensive utilization factories for dozens of items, such as earthen sugar, oil extraction, winemaking, starch processing, non-staple food processing, and earthen paper processing, giving the province's light industry a brand new look.

The People's Communes' large-scale development of light industry can utilize local materials, process them locally, and supply them locally, greatly accelerating the processing of agricultural products, solving the transportation difficulties of market supply, and timely meeting the needs of the people's lives. In this way, the passive "sandwiched biscuit" situation of light industry has been fundamentally changed.

In the process of establishing factories, the People's Communes in various places, adhering to the spirit of self-reliance and the principle of "doing whatever can be done and doing whatever is needed," overcame all difficulties. First of all, on the issue of labor, the People's Communes in various places gave full play to the superiority of the commune's unified allocation of labor, carefully calculated, properly arranged, vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings, and squeezed out a portion of male and female labor to invest in light industry. On the issues of capital and factory equipment, the communes also found solutions using the method of "indigenous methods to cope with poverty." On the one hand, they utilized surplus old houses, temples, ancestral halls, water mill houses, etc., converting them into factory buildings, quickly launching production; on the other hand, because processing factories have short processing times and quick profit returns, they used the profits obtained from processing for a period as capital construction investment, solving the difficulty of insufficient capital construction funds. On the issue of solving the problem of production machinery and equipment, they made extensive use of indigenous iron, ceramics, bamboo, and wood to replace steel raw materials, self-made indigenous machines, and produced many wooden paper-making machines, sweet potato planing machines, sweet potato flour machines, ceramic distillation towers, and other indigenous machines, solving the difficulty of a shortage of foreign machines.

On the issues of power and technical talent, the People's Communes in various places sought solutions through large-scale comprehensive utilization of water power and methods such as old factories leading new factories and training talent.

    解决农产品加工问题  满足人民生活需要
    江西人民公社大办轻工业
    本报南昌27日电  江西省各地人民公社在最近两个月内办起三万六千多座轻工业工厂。入秋以来，由于江西农业大丰收，大批农产品急待加工处理。同时广大人民群众对生活资料的供应要求更多更好。在两重压力下，使江西省的轻工业处于“夹糖烧饼”的被动局面。
    用什么办法更快地发展轻工业呢？有些人眼睛向上，伸手要上级给劳动力给技术人才，给资金、设备。中共江西省委根据很多地区的经验提出：大办轻工业不能光靠国家投资，必须依靠群众，依靠公社，自力更生，土法上马，先土后洋。于是于10月12日在波阳县召开了全省轻工业现场会议，批判了上述错误思想，大力推广波阳县依靠公社大办轻工业的经验。
    波阳现场会议后，一个以大办农产品加工工厂和综合利用工厂为中心的大办轻工业高潮，很快便在全省各人民公社中掀起。赣南行政区的龙南、广昌等七个县，九十七个人民公社，一下子办起红薯加工等各种农产品加工工厂六千多个。九江专区的湖口、都昌、九江等县人民公社，新办起植物油、饲料、碾米、红薯、野生植物、黄豆、食品、皮毛、篦具等等农产品加工工厂和综合利用厂一万二千多个。从10月中旬到现在为止，全省各地人民公社两个多月时间新办起土糖、榨油、酿酒、淀粉加工、副食品加工、土纸加工等几十项农产品加工工厂和综合利用厂共达三万六千多个，使全省轻工业出现了崭新的面貌。
    人民公社大办轻工业可以就地取材，就地加工，就地供应，就大大加速了农产品的加工处理，解决了市场供应的运输困难，及时满足了人民生活的需要。这样，也就基本改变了轻工业处于“夹糖烧饼”的被动局面。
    在办厂过程中，各地人民公社本着自力更生的精神，和“能办什么就办什么，需要什么办什么”的原则，克服了一切困难，首先，在劳动力问题上，各地人民公社发挥了公社统一调配劳动力的优越性，精打细算，妥善安排，大办集体福利事业，挤出了一部分男女劳动力投入轻工业。在资金和厂房设备问题上，公社用“土办法穷对付”的方法，也得到了解决。一方面利用多余的旧民房、寺庙祠堂、水碓房等，改建成厂房，迅速上马，投入生产；另一方面，由于加工厂加工时间短，利润收获快，加工一个时期即把加工获得的利润作为基建投资，解决了基建资金不足的困难。在解决生产机器设备问题上，大量利用土铁、陶瓷、竹木等代替钢铁原材，自制土机器，制成了很多木质造纸机、刨薯机、薯粉机、陶瓷蒸馏塔等等土机器，解决了洋机器不足的困难。
    在动力和技术人才问题上，各地人民公社就大闹水力综合利用，和以老厂带新厂，培训人才等办法求得了解决。
