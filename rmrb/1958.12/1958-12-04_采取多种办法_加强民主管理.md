Adopt Various Methods to Strengthen Democratic Management
    Frequent Inspection and Comparison
    According to Anhui Daily, since Feiguang People's Commune in Feixi County implemented democratic management more than two months ago, countless facts have proven that this is a crucial key to improving production and consolidating the commune.
    Recently, the commune's leadership conducted a serious inspection of democratic management. Their experience is: further implementing democratic management lies first in cadres establishing a democratic style. Throughout the commune, ideological education was strengthened among cadres, from within the Party to outside the Party, through work inspections. The significance of implementing democratic management for improving production and consolidating the commune was discussed, simplified practices were criticized, and democratic management was made a key content of regular inspections and comparisons. Second, cadres participated in production, led production, and integrated with the masses. The commune stipulated that the commune director, deputy director, and cadres should labor for 100 days each year, accountants for 80 days, and work area cadres for 150 days each year. Production team leaders participated in production the same as commune members. Third, commune members were widely absorbed into the management of all commune affairs. The commune member representative assembly was held once per quarter, and major events such as production plans, financial budgets, distribution plans, cadre appointments, and labor management were discussed and decided by the representative assembly. Financial accounts and all expenditures were regularly announced to the masses. Public welfare organizations such as canteens and nurseries were directly managed by the management committee elected by commune members. Specialized organizations were established for production technology research and tool reform, and commune members were widely absorbed to participate. Fourth, various forms of democracy were adopted to promote democracy, such as organizing regular and irregular big-character posters; setting up opinion books and opinion boxes in various public places; and setting up leap forward columns, criticism and commendation columns, honor rolls, and "calling the roll" platforms in each work area production team. In addition, each squad and platoon established democratic life meetings twice a week, and each company and battalion every two weeks, to widely listen to the opinions of commune members and carry out criticism and suggestions between commune members, and between commune members and cadres.
    Explaining the Rationale Makes Things Easier
    According to Xinhua Daily, the Daiyao People's Commune in Xinghua County recently held a cadre meeting to launch a "speaking out" and debate on two working methods and two working styles, affirming that there is no contradiction between implementing "three-izations" (Organization militarization, Action combatization, Life collectivization) and promoting democracy, and that "three-izations" must be built on the basis of democratic management.
    At the meeting, everyone criticized Liu Shurong, the Party branch secretary of the Guishan Brigade, for not doing mobilization and persuasion work in implementing various tasks, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, causing the team to fall behind other teams in every task. The quality of this year's autumn planting was also the worst in the township.
    Everyone cited the recent example of mobilizing the masses to test stool samples for disease examination. This was originally a good thing, but because the Guishan Brigade did not explain what was going on to the masses, it ordered the masses to send stool samples. Cadres also urged door-to-door, but even so, the task was not completed on time. The Zhengjia Brigade, which is adjacent to the Guishan Brigade, explained the rationale clearly first, and the masses happily sent stool samples for testing.
    Regarding Liu Shurong's problems, everyone further analyzed the reasons for the simple and rigid working style: First, he did not seriously study the Party's policies, and his own understanding was not improved, so he could not convince people with reason. Second, he did not grasp the task tightly or resolutely at the beginning. When the higher authorities criticized, he rushed to catch up with the task without consulting the masses. Third, cadres could not lead by example and set an example to motivate the masses. After the debate, everyone agreed that to ensure a greater leap forward and give full play to the superiority of the three-izations, it is necessary to thoroughly change the style, follow the mass line, strengthen ideological work, and rely on the high consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses to complete the task.
    Major Power Belongs to the Commune, Minor Power to the Companies and Platoons
    According to Dazhong Daily, Aiguo People's Commune in Ju County implemented democratic management while implementing organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization.
    In leading production, the commune also gave battalions and companies the flexibility to arrange production when implementing a combination of large-scale operations and divided responsibility. When the commune deploys various tasks, it first analyzes which method of operation is suitable. For example, if deep plowing, planting wheat, and autumn harvest are better implemented with large-scale operations, then large-scale operations are implemented. However, if methods such as cutting and drying sweet potato chips and storing sweet potatoes are better implemented with divided responsibility or even household responsibility, then power is decentralized, and battalions and companies adopt effective measures according to their own circumstances. This means that major power is in the commune and minor power is in the battalions and companies. The commune studies it well, and everyone does it separately. Not only is the commune flexible in dispatching forces to complete major tasks such as industry, agriculture, and transportation, but it can also give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of battalion and company cadres and better complete the work within their authority. In order to complete the task, the production company actively held meetings of platoon and squad cadres, or old peasant forums, to actively study the completion of the current task, and make preparations for the next stage of production in advance, reversing the passive situation of only listening to orders and arranging work in the past, and achieving a clear understanding of production.
    Promote Good Management Experience
    According to Heilongjiang Daily, Dongning County's Iron and Steel People's Commune paid more attention to implementing democratic management after realizing organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization.
    For many days, the commune's Party committee has used various meetings and Party lessons to carry out democratic management education among cadres above the level of team leader in the entire commune, and summarized and promoted the five methods of democratic management implemented in the Dadu River Cultivation Area: ① Everything goes through democratic discussion and organizes debates; ② Cultivation area representative meetings are held quarterly, or democratic evaluation summaries are conducted at the end of a period of work; ③ Cadres individually visit commune members and help commune members solve specific problems; ④ Commune members post big-character posters anytime and anywhere if they have opinions; ⑤ Each cultivation area and each team has an opinion box.
    After conscientiously implementing the policy of democratic management, the entire commune's work has greatly changed. Originally, the deep plowing work in the Industrial and Agricultural Cultivation Area was progressing slowly, and the cadres had no confidence. After fully discussing the issue with the masses, the masses put forward many effective measures, and the task was completed in seven days.

    采取多种办法  加强民主管理
    经常检查评比
    据安徽日报消息  肥西县肥光人民公社实行管理民主化的两个多月以来，无数事实证明，这是搞好生产、巩固公社的重要关键。
    最近该社领导上对民主管理问题，进行了认真检查，他们的经验是：进一步贯彻管理民主化，首先在于干部树立民主作风。全社在干部中，通过检查工作，从党内到党外，加强了思想教育，讨论了实行管理民主化对于搞好生产、巩固公社的重大意义，批判了简单化的做法，并将管理民主化作为经常检查评比的主要内容。其次，干部参加生产领导生产，与群众打成一片。公社规定社长、副社长和干部，每年劳动一百天，会计八十天，作业区干部每年劳动一百五十天，生产队长和社员一样参加生产。第三，广泛吸收社员参加公社一切事务的管理。社员代表大会每季召开一次，有关生产计划、财务预算、分配方案、干部任用、劳动管理等重大事件，均经代表大会讨论决议。财务账目一切开支定期向群众公布。食堂、托儿所等公共福利组织由社员选举管理委员会直接管理。生产技术研究、工具改革成立专门组织，广泛吸收社员参加。第四，采取了多种多样的民主形式，发扬民主如组织定期和不定期的张贴大字报；在各公共场所设立意见簿、意见箱；各作业区生产队设跃进栏、批评表扬栏、光荣榜、点将台等。此外，各班排还建立两晚开会一次，各连营两周一次的民主生活会，广泛听取社员意见，开展社员与社员之间，社员与干部之间的批评建议。
    说清道理好办事
    据新华日报消息  兴化县戴窑人民公社最近召开的干部会议上展开了两种工作方法，两种工作作风的鸣放辩论，肯定实行“三化”和发扬民主丝毫没有矛盾，“三化”必须建筑在管理民主化的基础上。
    在会上，大家批评了桂山大队支部书记刘书荣在贯彻各项任务中不做动员说服工作，引起群众不满，使得该队每次工作都落在别的队后面，今年秋播质量也是全乡的倒数第一名。
    大家举出最近动员群众化验大便检查疾病的例子。这本是一件好事，但是由于桂山大队根本没有向群众讲清楚是怎么一回事，就下命令叫群众把大便送去。干部还挨门逐户的催促，虽然如此，任务还没有按时完成。与桂山大队毗邻的征家大队，由于先把道理说清楚，群众都欢欢喜喜的送大便去化验。
    就刘书荣的问题，大家进一步分析了工作作风简单生硬的原因：第一，没有认真的学习党的方针政策，自己的认识未提高，不能以理服人。第二，执行任务开始抓得不紧，不坚决，等到上级提出批评时，就忙于赶任务，不和群众商量。第三，干部不能以身作则，做出样子，带动群众。经过辩论，大家一致认为要保证更大跃进，充分发挥三化的优越性，必须彻底改变作风，走群众路线，加强思想工作，依靠群众的高度自觉性和积极性去完成。
    大权归公社  小权给营连
    据大众日报消息  莒县爱国人民公社，在实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的同时，实行了管理民主化。
    该社在领导生产上，实行大兵团作战和分片包干相结合的方法时，也给营、连安排生产的机动权。社里在部署各项任务时，先分析一下适合那种作战方法，如深翻地、种麦、秋收实行大兵团作战好，就实行大兵团作战。但像切晒红薯干和储藏红薯等，分片包干甚至包到户的办法比较好，就权力下放，由营、连根据本单位的情况，采取有效措施。这样做是大权在公社，小权在营、连，公社研究好，大家分头干。不仅公社调遣力量灵活，完成工农业和交通运输等项重大的任务，同时能发挥营、连干部的积极性主动性，更好地完成在他们职权范围的工作。生产连为了完成任务，主动地召开排、班干部会议，或老农座谈会，主动研究完成当前任务，事先打好下一步的生产谱，扭转了过去光听命令安排工作的被动局面，做到生产心中有数。
    推广好的管理经验
    据黑龙江日报消息  东宁县钢铁人民公社在实现了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化以后，更注意贯彻民主管理化。
    很多日子以来社党委就利用各种会议和上党课的形式在全社队长以上的干部中，进行民主管理教育并总结推广了大肚川耕作区实行民主管理的五种方法：①事事经过民主讨论，组织辩论；②按季召开耕作区代表会议，或在一段工作完了时进行民主评比总结；③干部个别访问社员；帮助社员解决具体问题；④社员有意见随时随地贴大字报；⑤各耕作区、各队都设意见箱。
    经过认真贯彻民主管理的方针，全社工作面貌大大改观。原来工农耕作区深翻工作进度很慢，干部没信心，组织群众充分讨论以后，群众提出了许多有效措施，七天就完成了任务。
