Supporting the Whole Country Is Our Glorious Task
Chen Lei, Vice Governor of Heilongjiang Province

Heilongjiang Province is one of the key regions in the country's First Five-Year Plan. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country and fraternal provinces and cities, industrial construction has developed rapidly. 122 projects above the quota have been completed, including 16 of the 22 projects aided by the Soviet Union. By the end of 1957, the province's total industrial output value had increased from 49.1% in 1952 to 63.1%. This year, industrial output value has increased even more than last year. Heilongjiang Province has become a region with relatively developed electromechanical manufacturing, forestry, and coal industries. The place formerly known as "Great Northern Wilderness" has now become one of the country's important industrial bases.

Our country is a socialist country. Under the unified leadership of the Central Government, we implement the principle of planned economy. Fraternal provinces and cities across the country support each other and cooperate to build our country into a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible. The rapid development of industry in Heilongjiang Province is the result of the support of the whole country. Even now, we still receive assistance from many regions across the country for certain products we need. Taking steel as an example, Heilongjiang Province is still a weak link, so the steel needed for the machinery industry and capital construction mainly relies on the support of fraternal provinces and cities. For example, light industrial products still rely on the support of Shanghai and other provinces and cities. Now that our province's industry has greatly developed, we must take vigorously supporting the whole country as our primary task. This is a major shift for us, and we must make every effort to do a good job in mutual assistance and cooperation with various provinces and cities, and contribute our strength to the nationwide Great Leap Forward.

In this year's Great Leap Forward, all industrial and mining enterprises in our province have thoroughly implemented the policy of fully tapping potential, vigorously supporting the whole country, and gradually developing rationally. According to statistics as of the end of September, the proportion of products supporting fraternal provinces and cities to total products is: 100% for water turbines and water turbine generators, and more than 90% for boilers, machine tools, AC motors, bearings, etc., 41.7% for coal, 38% for logs, and 78.5% for sawn timber. These products are supplied to more than 20 provinces and cities across the country, which shows that a large part of our industrial production in Heilongjiang Province is oriented to the whole country. The entire working class and all the people of our province are proud of this.

In order to better complete the glorious task of vigorously supporting the whole country in the future, we must further promote the communist style and resolutely struggle against departmentalism. It is true that the vast majority of regions and enterprises in our province are working hard and seriously on the task of supporting the whole country, but some units still sometimes show a lack of enthusiasm and seriousness for cooperative products or fail to fulfill delivery contracts on time. Individual units even adopt the practice of prioritizing themselves over others when materials are in short supply, which is obviously wrong. It must be understood that supporting the whole country is a question of the relationship between the part and the whole, the local and the overall situation. Any delay or postponement in our daily work of supporting the whole country will affect the construction progress of fraternal regions and the completion of the national plan. This is not allowed for us communists. We should have the communist spirit of selflessness and public service, taking care of the overall situation everywhere and correctly handling the relationship between the local and the whole. Departmentalism and local viewpoints are all manifestations of the remnants of capitalist ideology and must be resolutely overcome.

We should also have a comprehensive view of vigorously supporting the whole country and appropriately developing ourselves. Provinces like ours with relatively developed industries should put supporting the whole country first, otherwise, we will commit the mistake of departmentalism and localism. Of course, to vigorously support the whole country, we also need to appropriately develop ourselves, otherwise, it will be detrimental to supporting the whole country. According to the requirements of various parts of the country for the industry of Heilongjiang Province, and according to the needs of the province's agricultural development, we must also appropriately develop ourselves. The relationship between supporting the whole country and rationally developing the industry of our province must be properly handled. Since the products of our province's key enterprises are mostly oriented to the whole country, it is of great significance to strengthen the leadership of key enterprises and help them better complete their production tasks. In the current situation of relatively tight materials, priority must be given to ensuring the key, and appropriate consideration should be given to the general.

At present, there are still three issues in our province's support to the whole country that deserve attention: First, support to the whole country needs to be further organized and planned. All support tasks should be included in the plan as much as possible, and efforts should be made to reduce temporary additional tasks, so as to ensure the planned nature of industrial production and reduce blindness, which will be conducive to greater support to the whole country. Second, when determining production targets, especially the part that supports the whole country, we should start from many aspects in the supply of raw materials and actively take various measures to ensure that they are implemented. Third, we must vigorously reverse the backward state of transportation. At present, many materials in our province are backlogged waiting for transportation, especially the transportation of coal and wood is the most tense, so it cannot fully meet the needs of fraternal provinces and cities. The main reason is the lack of vehicles. In the current situation of more goods and fewer vehicles, we arrange the transportation of goods according to the principle of prioritizing external over internal, ensuring key and urgent needs, and appropriately taking care of general needs. We are also taking all measures to tap transportation potential, improve loading and unloading work, and accelerate vehicle turnover, in an effort to change the current tense transportation situation.

All employees on the industrial front in Heilongjiang Province bear the glorious task of vigorously supporting the whole country. We must go all out, launch mass movements, carry out technical revolution, vigorously tap potential, and strive for greater leaps forward in supporting the industry and agriculture of the whole country.

    支援全国是我们的光荣任务
    黑龙江省副省长  陈雷
    黑龙江省是国家第一个五年建设的重点地区之一，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在全国人民和各兄弟省市的大力支援下，工业建设有了飞快的发展，建成了限额以上的工程一百二十二项，其中苏联帮助建设的二十二项工程完成了十六项。到1957年底，全省工业总产值已由1952年49.1％提高到63.1％。今年工业产值比去年有了更大的增长。黑龙江省已经成为一个以机电制造工业、森林和煤炭工业比较发达的地区。从前号称“北大荒”的地方，现在已经成为国家的重要工业基地之一。
    我们的国家是社会主义国家，在中央统一领导下，实行计划经济的原则，全国各兄弟省市互相支援，分工协作，为了尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的国家。我们黑龙江省的工业之所以能够迅速发展起来，就是全国支援的结果。直到现在我们需要的某些产品仍然得到全国许多地区的帮助，以钢铁为例，我们黑龙江省还是一个薄弱环节，因而在机械工业和基本建设等方面所需要的钢铁，主要依靠兄弟省市的支援；又如轻工业品还要依靠上海等省市的支援。当我省的工业目前已经有了很大发展，必须把大力支援全国作为自己的首要任务，这对我们来说是一个很大的转变，我们必须努力以赴，搞好各省市的互助协作，在全国的大跃进中贡献我们的力量。
    在今年大跃进中，我省各工矿企业都贯彻执行了充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国，逐步合理发展的方针。截至9月末的统计，支援兄弟省市的产品占全部产品的比例是：水轮机和水轮发电机100％，锅炉、机床、交流电动机、轴承等都在90％以上，煤炭41.7％，原木38％，锯材78.5％，这些产品供应全国二十多个省市，这说明我们黑龙江省的工业生产面向全国的部分是很大的。我省全体工人阶级和全体人民群众以此引以为荣。
    为了在今后更好地完成大力支援全国的光荣任务，必须进一步发扬共产主义风格，坚决和本位主义思想作斗争。诚然，我省绝大多数地区和企业，对于支援全国的任务是努力的、认真的，但也有的单位有时还发生对协作产品不够积极和认真或不能按期执行交货合同的现象，个别单位甚至在材料紧张的时候，竟采取先己后人的作法，这显然是错误的。必须了解：对于全国的支援是一个部分和整体、局部和全局的关系问题，在我们支援全国的日常工作中，如有任何的迟缓和延误，都会影响兄弟地区的建设进度，都会影响国家计划的完成。这对我们共产主义者来说都是不容许的。我们应当具有舍己为人、大公无私的共产主义精神，处处照顾大局，正确处理局部和整体的关系。本位主义、局部观点，都是资本主义思想残余的表现，必须坚决加以克服。
    对于大力支援全国和适当发展自己，也应当有全面的看法。像我们这样工业较发达的省，应当把支援全国放在第一位，否则，就会犯本位主义、地方主义的错误。当然，要大力支援全国，也需要适当发展自己，否则，将不利于对全国的支援。按照全国各地对黑龙江省工业的要求，以及根据本省农业发展的需要，也要适当发展自己。支援全国和合理地发展本省的工业，二者的关系必须摆得恰当。鉴于我省重点企业的产品大部分面向全国，因此加强对重点企业的领导，帮助重点企业更好地完成生产任务具有重要意义。在当前材料比较紧张的情况下，必须优先保证重点，适当照顾一般。
    目前我省在支援全国方面，还有三个问题值得引起注意：第一，支援全国需要进一步有组织有计划地进行，应当把一切支援任务都尽量纳入计划，力求缩减临时追加的任务，从而保证工业生产的计划性，减少盲目性，以利于对全国更大的支援。第二，确定生产指标特别是支援全国的部分，在原材料的供应上应从多方面着手，积极采取各种措施予以保证，使之得到落实。第三，必须大力扭转运输工作的落后状况。目前我省有许多物资积压待运，尤以煤炭、木材的运输最为紧张，因而不能充分满足兄弟省市的需要，主要原因是车辆不足，在目前货多车少的情况下，我们对货物运输是按照先外后内，保证重点和急需，适当照顾一般的原则加以安排的，并且正在采取一切措施挖掘运输潜力，改进装卸工作，加速车辆周转，力求使目前运输的紧张状况有所改变。
    黑龙江省工业战线上的全体职工肩负着大力支援全国的光荣任务，我们必须鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，大力挖掘潜力，为更好地大力支援全国工农业的更大跃进而奋斗。
