    This newspaper reports that Fuyang County, Anhui Province, has widely mobilized the masses to vigorously develop artificial biogas and collect natural biogas from ditches and ponds, achieving preliminary biogasification. The county's daily biogas production has reached 300,000 to 500,000 cubic meters. In addition to using biogas for lighting, boiling water, and cooking in their daily lives, hospitals and factories in the county have also used biogas to replace fuels such as alcohol and gasoline. There are 172 hospitals and health institutions that use biogas to sterilize needles. At the same time, the county has established six biogas power stations (including three power plants), using biogas directly as power or for power generation, for pumping water, milling flour, slicing, sawing wood, producing bearings and other tools. In addition, there are six film projection teams and two radio stations using biogas to generate electricity for film screenings and broadcasting. Thanks to the initial biogasification, the county has greatly alleviated the shortage of fuel in rural areas.
    Recently, Fuyang County, in its efforts to solve the fuel problem with biogas, has also found a way to manufacture artificial coal. In developing and utilizing natural biogas from ditches and ponds, the masses in Kouzi Township of the county saw that biogas could be produced from the ditches and ponds as fuel, so they used ditch mud mixed with wheat bran (rice husks, sawdust, broken straw, etc.) and a small amount of salt to create artificial coal, and they succeeded. This artificial coal (also known locally as biogas coal) generally has a mixing ratio of 90% pond mud, 9% wheat bran, and 1% salt. Every hundred catties of this kind of artificial coal can replace sixty-five to eighty catties of coal, is smokeless, and the ash residue can be used as fertilizer. After the successful creation of this artificial coal, it was immediately welcomed by the masses in various places. Fuyang County quickly established 3,612 artificial coal factories, forming a high tide of vigorous artificial coal production. At the same time, other counties in the Fuyang Special Zone are also universally promoting it. At present, of the 1.18 million people in Fuyang County, 940,000 people (approximately 80%) have widely used biogas and artificial coal as fuel.
    From November 8th to 13th, the Ministry of Agriculture held a national biogas on-site meeting in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, calling on all parts of the country to quickly promote the experience of Fuyang and other places in vigorously developing biogas and artificial coal, in order to solve the current shortage of coal, oil, firewood and other fuels in rural areas and the power problems in some rural areas.
    The meeting also requested that all localities universally promote artificial coal this winter and next spring. (Attached picture)

### 利用沼气  推广人造煤  新的燃料新的动力

    利用沼气  推广人造煤
    新的燃料新的动力
    本报讯  安徽省阜阳县广泛地发动群众，大搞人造沼气和收集沟塘自然沼气，实现了初步沼气化。全县日产沼气量已达到三十到五十万立方公尺。全县人民除在日常生活当中利用沼气点灯、烧水、煮饭之外，医院、工厂还利用了沼气代替酒精、汽油等燃料。仅医院和卫生机构用沼气煮针消毒的就有一百七十二处。同时，该县还建立了六个沼气动力站（其中有发电站三处），利用沼气直接作动力或发电，进行抽水、磨面、切片、锯木、生产轴承和其它工具。另外，还有六个用沼气发电放映电影的电影队和两个广播站。这个县由于实现了初步沼气化，大大缓和了农村中燃料的不足。
    最近，阜阳县在利用沼气解决燃料问题当中，又找到了一个制造人造煤的办法。这个县口孜乡群众在开发利用沟塘自然沼气中，看到沟塘里能出沼气作燃料，他们就用沟塘泥混合麦糠（谷壳、锯木屑、碎藁秆等均可）及少量食盐，创造人造煤，结果成功了。这种人造煤（当地又叫沼气煤）一般混合比例为塘泥90％，麦糠9％，食盐1％。这样的人造煤每百斤能顶六十五到八十斤煤，无烟，灰渣还可作肥料。这种人造煤创造成功后，立即受到各地群众的欢迎。阜阳县很快就建立了三千六百一十二个人造煤厂，形成了大搞人造煤的高潮。同时，阜阳专区其它各县也都在普遍推广。目前阜阳全县一百一十八万人口中，已有九十四万人（约占80％）广泛利用了沼气和人造煤作燃料。
    11月8日至13日，农业部在安徽省阜阳县召开了全国沼气现场会议，号召全国各地迅速推广阜阳等地大搞沼气和人造煤的经验，以解决当前农村中煤、油、柴等燃料不足和一部分农村的动力问题。
    会议还要求各地在今冬明春普遍推广人造煤。（附图片）
