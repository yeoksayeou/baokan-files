Spiritual Food Enters the Mines

"Up the mountain and down the mountain, water connects to water, and mountain connects to mountain. Bicycle wheels whir, turning to the mines and construction sites, loved by everyone."

This is a ditty that Li Dekuan, a young postman on Yaomo Mountain in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, often sings.

In the days when the whole nation was fighting for steel, the young postman Li Dekuan often pushed his bicycle, loaded with newspapers, magazines, and mail, from mountain to mountain, delivering newspapers and letters to the steel warriors in a timely manner.

Every day when he appeared on the construction site, people would surround him as if welcoming a relative, vying to buy newspapers and magazines, entrusting him to remit money and send letters; sometimes they would also ask him to buy some daily necessities such as candles.

    精神食粮进矿山
    “上山又下山，水连水来山连山，自行车轮子呜呜转，转到矿区、工地人人都喜欢。”
    这是新疆维吾尔自治区妖魔山上一位青年邮递员李德宽经常唱的几句顺口溜。
    在全民为钢铁而战的日子里，青年邮递员李德宽经常推着满载报刊、邮件的自行车，从这山跑到那山，及时把报刊、信件送到钢铁战士手里。
    每天他一出现在工地上，人们就像迎接亲人似地把他围起来，争着向他买报纸、杂志、托他汇款、寄信；有时还请他代买一些蜡烛等日常用品。
