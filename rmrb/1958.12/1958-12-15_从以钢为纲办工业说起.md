    Starting from Taking Steel as the Key Link in Developing Industry
    Yu Ping
    During the Beidaihe Conference of the Party Central Committee in August this year, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the opinion that developing industry must take steel as the key link. More than three months of practice have proved that this is an extremely important guideline for developing China's industry at high speed.
    The mass movement of taking steel as the key link, which has been launched across the country since the Beidaihe Conference, has achieved great success. In the first eight months of this year, we produced a total of more than 4.4 million tons of steel, more than 5.2 million tons of iron, more than 116 million tons of coal, and 38,000 machine tools. However, in the three months from September to November, we produced more than 5.2 million tons of steel, more than 14.8 million tons of iron, more than 170 million tons of coal, and 45,000 machine tools. During this period, the freight volume of various means of transportation also increased. The leap forward in steel has very clearly driven the leap forward in various industrial sectors and transportation departments.
    The reason why China's industry can develop at a speed unprecedented in the world this year, and the reason why the output of steel and many other heavy industrial products can increase exponentially, is of course not only because of the guideline of taking steel as the key link. In the period from last winter to this spring, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the practical experience of the Chinese people's struggle over the past few years, formulated a general line and a series of guidelines and policies for China's socialist construction, let politics take command in economic work, eliminated people's superstition about industrialization, and established the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing central and local industries, and simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises. After that, the guideline of combining indigenous and foreign methods, the guideline of taking steel as the key link, and the guideline of launching mass movements to run industry were put forward. All these guidelines and policies have played a huge role in the high-speed development of industry.
    In actual work, there are indeed two different guidelines and policies. One guideline and policy can better mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, so that things can be done more, faster, better, and more economically, while the other guideline and policy can only less mobilize or even restrict the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, so that things get the opposite result, or cannot fully achieve the expected results. For example, when we implemented the three "simultaneous development" guidelines, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people were restricted to a certain extent; after the implementation of the three "simultaneous development" guidelines, the situation was completely different. However, people will further ask: Why can this kind of guideline and policy better mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, while that kind of guideline and policy cannot better mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people? What is the reason?
    This is indeed a question worth pondering. To answer this question, we must first understand the relationship between the objective world and the subjective world. The thing is like this: when our subjective world (ideological understanding) can correctly or relatively correctly reflect the objective world, our things will be done better; on the contrary, when our subjective world cannot correctly or cannot relatively correctly reflect the objective world, our things cannot be done well or even will be done badly. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong told us in "On Practice": "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If it does not conform, they will fail in practice." Therefore, it can be said that the fundamental reason why we have achieved such great victories in the cause of socialist construction over the past year lies in the fact that the Party's guidelines and policies are more suitable for the laws of the objective external world, suitable for objective economic laws, and not others.
    According to the Marxist point of view, people's understanding of the objective world is gradually deepened in the process of repeated practice. Our understanding of how to develop the socialist economy at high speed was not completely clear from the beginning, but gradually became clear step by step with the development of practice. We have also taken detours on some issues. For example, this is the case with the understanding of the relationship between various departments and aspects of the socialist economy. When our large-scale economic construction began, some comrades once believed that accelerating the development of agriculture and light industry would hinder the development of heavy industry, rather than promote the development of heavy industry; and some comrades once believed that the development of local small and medium-sized enterprises would hinder the development of central large enterprises, rather than promote the development of central large enterprises. In this way, some shortcomings were produced in actual work, that is, more attention was paid to heavy industry and less attention was paid to agriculture and light industry, and more attention was paid to central large enterprises and less attention was paid to local small and medium-sized enterprises. This one-sidedness in ideological methods and shortcomings in actual work have been timely corrected by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The same is true in the relationship between the steel industry and other industries. Some of our comrades demanded to develop heavy industry as soon as possible, and this strong desire to develop heavy industry at high speed is good. However, on the issue of how to develop at high speed, our thinking was not very clear for a considerable period of time. Some comrades believe that various heavy industrial departments must be placed side by side in order to develop quickly; some comrades oppose the practice of placing them side by side, but believe that the focus should not be on the steel industry but on other industries. Practice has proved that these comrades have not found the "key" to solve the problem, or have not grasped the main contradiction within heavy industry, and have not recognized and mastered the objective laws of economic development, so they cannot achieve the expected results in actual work. After Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the opinion of taking steel as the key link to develop industry in August this year, this problem was fundamentally solved.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to always pay attention to studying and solving the main contradictions of things, so as to solve the whole problem. He said in "On Contradiction": "If there are many contradictions in any process, one of them must be the main one, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are in a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, when studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must do our best to find its main contradiction. If we grasp this main contradiction, all problems will be solved easily." In the past, on the issue of how to develop heavy industry at high speed, we often could not find the center in the face of complex things and could not grasp the main contradictions.
    The various departments of industry, especially the various departments of heavy industry, are closely linked to each other. To develop steel, there must be coal and electricity, machines, chemical products (such as sulfuric acid, explosives for mining), refractory materials, cement, and wood, etc. Or, to develop coal, there must be machines, electricity, steel, cement, and wood, etc. However, the central issue of China's current industry is the production of steel and the production of machinery. With steel and machinery, we can produce all kinds of means of production, equip heavy industry itself and light industry, and equip agriculture and transportation, so that the expanded reproduction of society can proceed more quickly. And steel is the most important condition for machinery production, that is, the development of machinery production depends on the development of steel production. This means that within heavy industry, the departments that are linked to each other are in a state of both opposition and unity, contradicting each other and promoting each other. However, among many contradictions, the contradiction between the steel industry and other industries is the main one. The development of steel determines the development of heavy industry and even the entire industry. This is an objective law. Recognizing and mastering this objective law and adopting the guideline of taking steel as the key link, we have grasped the "key" to developing industry at high speed. We demand to establish an independent and complete industrial system in a relatively short period of time, which essentially means to establish or first establish a relatively strong steel industry and machinery industry, especially the foundation of the steel industry. This is true from a national perspective, and it is also true from a perspective of a cooperation zone and a province or autonomous region.
    Recognizing and mastering objective economic laws is of extreme importance to socialist construction. Economic laws are the laws of the economic life process that do not depend on our will. All our work can only achieve the expected results if it is suitable for and utilizes economic laws. And violating economic laws, even the slightest violation, will only cause confusion in things and disrupt the working procedures. On the issue of dealing with economic laws, two erroneous tendencies should be opposed. One erroneous tendency is to be a slave to economic laws, believing that people are powerless in the face of the effects of economic laws, obliterating the subjective initiative of people, and not actively thinking of ways to prevent certain laws from having a destructive effect on society and using laws to benefit society. Another erroneous tendency is to negate objective laws, believing that we can ignore objective laws, can act freely, and do whatever we want. Neither of these two erroneous tendencies can allow the socialist construction cause to proceed smoothly. We communists are dialectical materialists, and dialectical materialism is the most respectful of the masses, respectful of practice, and also the most respectful of science. We should adopt a realistic and honest attitude towards objective laws. The more we adopt an honest attitude, the more we can deeply understand the objective world, make our subjective world suitable for the laws of the objective external world, and the more we can successfully transform the objective world.
    In China's socialist construction, there are some objective laws that we have recognized or begun to recognize; but there are still many objective laws that we have not recognized or mastered, which means that some of our economic work is not completely conscious or completely free. Therefore, strengthening the research and analysis of the actual economic development situation and strengthening the research on economic laws have a very realistic and urgent significance.

    从以钢为纲办工业说起
    余平
    在今年8月党的北戴河会议期间，毛泽东同志提出了发展工业必须以钢为纲的意见。三个多月的实践证明，这是高速度发展我国工业的一个极其重要的方针。
    北戴河会议以后在全国范围内开展起来的以钢为纲的群众运动，已经取得了巨大的成就。今年前八个月，我们一共生产了钢四百四十多万吨，铁五百二十多万吨，煤一亿一千六百多万吨，机床三万八千台。而从9月到11月的三个月时间内，我们却生产了钢五百二十多万吨，铁一千四百八十多万吨，煤一亿七千多万吨，机床四万五千台。在这期间，各种运输工具的货运量也有了增加。钢铁的跃进，极其明显地带动了各个工业部门和运输部门的跃进。
    今年我国工业所以能够以世界上从来没有过的速度发展，钢铁和其他许多重工业产品产量所以能够成倍地增加，当然不只是因为有以钢为纲这样一条方针。在去年冬季到今年春季的一段时间内，党中央和毛泽东同志根据几年来我国人民斗争的实际经验，对我国的社会主义建设制定了总的路线和一系列的方针政策，在经济工作中让政治挂了帅，破除了人们对工业化的迷信，确立了工业和农业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的原则。此后，又提出了土洋结合的方针，以钢为纲和大搞群众运动办工业的方针。所有这些方针政策，对于工业的高速度发展都起了巨大的作用。
    在实际工作中，确实有两种不同的方针政策，一种方针政策可以比较多地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，从而使事情办得多快好省，而另一种方针政策则只能比较少地发挥甚至只能束缚人民群众的积极性和创造性，从而使事情得到相反的结果，或者不能完全得到预期的效果。例如，当我们实行三个“并举”的方针以前，人民群众的积极性和创造性就受到一定程度的限制；在实行三个“并举”方针以后，情形就完全是另一个样子。但是，人们会进一步发问：为什么这样一种方针政策就能够更好地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，而那样一种方针政策就不能更好地发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，其道理何在？
    这确实是值得我们深思的一个问题。要回答这个问题，我们必须首先弄清楚客观世界和主观世界的关系。事情本来是这样，当我们的主观世界（思想认识）能够正确地或者比较正确地反映客观世界的时候，我们的事情就办得比较好；相反，当我们的主观世界不能正确地或者不能比较正确地反映客观世界的时候，我们的事情就不能办好甚至会办坏。这就是毛泽东同志在“实践论”中告诉我们的：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”因此，可以这样说，我们一年来在社会主义建设事业中获得如此巨大的胜利，根本的原因就在于党的方针政策更加适合于客观外界的规律性，适合于客观经济法则，而不是其他。
    照马克思主义的观点说来，人们对于客观世界的认识，是在反复实践的过程中逐步深化的。我们对于如何高速度发展社会主义经济，思想上并不是一开始就完全明确，而是随着实践的发展而一步步地逐渐明确的。在某一些问题上还走过弯路。例如对于社会主义经济的各个部门和各个方面的关系的了解就是这样。当我国大规模经济建设开始以后，有些同志在工业和农业的关系问题上，就曾经一度认为加快了农业和轻工业的发展，会妨碍重工业的发展，而不是促进重工业的发展；又有一些同志在中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业的关系问题上，曾经一度认为地方中小型企业的发展，会妨碍中央大型企业的发展，而不是促进中央大型企业的发展。这样，就在实际工作中产生了一些缺点，即多注意了重工业而少注意农业和轻工业，多注意了中央大型企业而少注意地方中小型企业。这种思想方法上的片面性和实际工作中的缺点，已经被党中央和毛泽东同志及时地纠正了。
    在钢铁工业和其他工业的关系问题上也是这样。我们有些同志要求尽快地发展重工业，这种对高速度发展重工业的强烈愿望是好的。但是在如何高速度发展的问题上，在相当长的一段时间内，思想中是不很明确的。有些同志认为必须把各个重工业部门都平列起来，才能发展得快；有些同志反对平列的作法，但是又认为应当突出的不是钢铁工业而是其他工业。实践证明，这些同志都没有找到解决问题的“钥匙”，或者说都没有抓住重工业内部的主要矛盾，没有认识和掌握经济发展的客观规律性，因而在实际工作中就不能达到预期的效果。今年8月毛泽东同志提出了以钢为纲发展工业的意见以后，这个问题才从根本上解决了。
    毛泽东同志教导我们要经常注意研究和解决事物的主要矛盾，从而解决整个问题。他在“矛盾论”里说：“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要的和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”过去，我们在如何高速度发展重工业的问题上，就是常常在复杂事物的面前找不到中心，抓不住主要矛盾。
    工业的各个部门，尤其是重工业的各个部门，是彼此密切联系的。要发展钢铁，就必须有煤炭和电力，有机器，有化工产品（如硫酸、开矿用的炸药），有耐火材料、水泥和木材等等。或者是，要发展煤炭，就必须有机器，有电力，有钢材、水泥和木材等等。但是，我国当前工业的中心问题是钢铁的生产和机械的生产。有了钢铁和机械，我们就可以生产各种各样的生产资料，装备重工业本身和轻工业，并且装备农业和交通运输业，使社会的扩大再生产能够更快地进行。而钢铁又是机械生产最主要的条件，即机械生产的发展决定于钢铁生产的发展。这就是说，在重工业内部，彼此联系的部门都处在又对立又统一的状态，互相矛盾着又互相促进着。但是，在许多矛盾中，钢铁工业和其他工业的矛盾是主要的。钢铁的发展，决定着重工业以至整个工业的发展。这是客观的规律性。认识和掌握了这个客观规律性，采取以钢为纲的方针，我们就抓到了高速度发展工业的“钥匙”。我们要求在一个比较短的时期内建立起一个独立完整的工业体系，从本质上说，就是要建立起或者是首先建立起比较强大的钢铁工业和机械工业，特别是钢铁工业的基础。从全国范围说来是如此，从一个协作区和一个省、自治区说来也是如此。
    认识和掌握客观的经济法则，对于社会主义建设有着极端重要的意义。经济法则是不以我们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的规律性。我们的一切工作，只有在适合和利用经济法则的情况下才能取得预期的效果。而违反经济法则，即使是极小的违反，都只会引起事情的混乱，引起工作程序的破坏。在对待经济法则的问题上，应当反对两种错误的倾向。一种错误倾向是作经济法则的奴隶，认为人们在经济法则的作用面前是无能为力的，抹煞了人的主观能动作用，不去积极想办法防止某些法则对于社会的破坏作用和利用法则来为社会谋福利。另一种错误倾向是否定客观法则，认为我们可以不管客观法则，可以自由行动，要怎样做就怎样做。这两种错误倾向，都不可能使社会主义建设事业顺利地进行。我们共产党人是辩证唯物论者，辩证唯物论是最尊重群众、尊重实践的，也是最尊重科学的。我们对于客观法则，应当采取实事求是的老实态度。越是采取老实态度，就越加能够深刻地认识客观世界，使自己的主观世界适合于客观外界的规律性，也就越加能够成功地改造客观世界。
    在我国的社会主义建设中，有一些客观法则我们已经认识到了，或开始认识到了；但是还有许多客观法则我们还没有认识到，还没有掌握，这就是说我们有一些经济工作还没有完全自觉，还不完全自由。因此，加强对实际经济发展情况的研究和分析工作，加强对经济规律的研究工作，有着极现实的和迫切的意义。
