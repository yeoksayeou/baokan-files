    Visiting the Moluccas
    Shen Dingyi
    The Brightly Colored Moluccas
    In early November, we arrived in Ambon, the capital of Indonesia's Moluccas province. The plane slowly descended amidst the green hills and clear waters. The lower we went, the richer and greener the colors became. Coconuts, palms, and sago trees (a type of tree whose core can be used as food; sago is the staple food of the Moluccan people, so some call it the "bread tree") swept towards us. The bay shimmered golden in the sunset.

    We landed at Pattimura Airport, nestled between the mountains and the sea. Girls in bright pink and red dresses danced and sang at the airport, while a team of curly-haired young men enthusiastically played bamboo flutes.

    From Ambon onwards, we switched to boats and sailed for over a week on the beautiful Moluccas Sea.

    The Moluccas archipelago consists of 997 islands of various sizes, with a total land area of just over 80,000 square kilometers and a population of less than one million. However, the ocean area between the islands is more than ten times larger than the land area, making the Moluccas very rich in marine products such as fish, shellfish, and pearls. The main products on the islands are cloves, nutmeg, and copra. Ordinary people mainly use sago pith as food. Rice and daily necessities have to be transported from elsewhere.

    The Moluccas hold a very important position. To the east, it is close to Dutch-occupied West Irian; to the north, it faces the Philippines; and to the south, it is not far from Australia. Only to the west does it border its own territory—the islands of Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara. In the seventeenth century, the first foothold for the Dutch invasion of Indonesia was Ambon. During World War II, Japanese imperialism established important military bases in the South Pacific on some of the Moluccan islands. Now, the Moluccas have become a frontline position for the Indonesian people against imperialist intervention and for the recovery of West Irian.

    In the past year, the people and army of the Moluccas have undergone major tests. When the North Sulawesi rebellion was rampant at the beginning of this year, the Moluccas were targeted by imperialists and rebel groups, who attempted to launch several coups there. But their plots failed. Later, the rebel groups crossed the sea and occupied some parts of northern Moluccas, and American planes from US air bases began to brutally bomb the Moluccas, attempting to force the Moluccan military and civilians to submit. But the Moluccan military and civilians did not yield. They recovered the lost territories, shot down American bombers, and captured the American pilot Pope alive, exposing the crime of American armed intervention in Indonesia to the world.

    We accompanied President Sukarno on his visit to the Moluccas. President Sukarno also invited the ambassadors and ministers of twelve countries to Indonesia to travel with him, including our ambassador Huang Zhen and Soviet ambassador Volkov. President Sukarno's visit to the Moluccas had great significance. According to him, this was to thank the Moluccan people for their contribution to upholding unity and opposing division.

    The Blood Debt Owed by American Air Pirates
    As soon as we arrived in the Moluccas, the American air pirate Pope became the center of everyone's discussion. To this end, I specifically interviewed Lieutenant Colonel Pieters, the commander of the Moluccas and West Irian Defense Zone, during the trip.

    "The people of the Moluccas hate Pope intensely," Lieutenant Colonel Pieters began. He cited an example: when Pope was escorted to Ambon, thousands of people waited at the pier to beat this American murderer to death. If the military and police had not tried their best to dissuade them, even ten Popes would have been beaten to death. After Pope was sent to Jakarta, the people eagerly demanded his trial and sent telegrams to the central government several times, demanding that he be sentenced to death.

    Pieters then meticulously described the capture of Pope. On the morning of May 18, Lieutenant Colonel Pieters led his troops to attack Morotai, which had been occupied by the rebel groups. Just as they set sail from Ambon, Pope piloted a B-26 bomber to attack them. A bomb exploded thirty meters away from the command ship on which Lieutenant Colonel Pieters was riding. However, the plane was immediately shot down. Pope and an Indonesian rebel pilot parachuted to escape, but they were finally captured alive on a small island near Ambon. Including Pope's plane, the Moluccan government forces shot down a total of three American planes and also captured a Chiang Kai-shek gang pilot.

    All very important documents were found on Pope. A few months ago, I saw part of these documents in a hotel in Jakarta, which the army displayed to reporters. Among them were the certificate of the Taipei American Air Transport Company covering Pope's identity, as well as badges proving that he was a genuine member of the US Air Force. There were also some documents that were not made public. According to newspaper reports, one of these documents was an order from the US military command in the Ryukyu Islands to Pope, designating Pope to undertake a "temporary" mission to help the Indonesian rebels. This made it very clear that, in reality, it was the US Air Force that was bombing the Moluccas and other parts of eastern Indonesia.

    Pieters then calculated the blood debt owed by this American thief: he killed 400 Moluccans, sank three ships, injured seven, and destroyed many civilian houses, schools, churches, and markets. Many people were even bombed to death in their sleep.

    Not only that, but Pope's hands were also stained with the blood of our Chinese compatriots. Readers probably still remember that half a year ago, two Hong Kong ships, the "Flying Geese" and the "Moro," which were docked outside the port of Ambon, were bombed, and dozens of Chinese crew members were killed and injured. Now the truth is out: this was also done by Pope.

    In his conversation, Lieutenant Colonel Pieters also revealed another fact, namely, that the United States was massively supplying weapons to the rebel groups. The rebels were attacking the Moluccas with brand-new American guns. The lieutenant colonel said that when he led his troops to liberate Morotai, he seized a large number of American weapons from the rebels, and also seized a very large American flag. The prisoners confessed that this American flag was used for air contact. This flag has now been sent to the National Council in the capital for preservation.

    From the above ironclad evidence, we can see to what extent the US imperialists' intervention in Indonesia had become rampant at that time.

    The Bad Reputation of the United States
    In March of this year, when the Indonesian government forces were about to launch a large-scale offensive against the rebel groups in central Sumatra, the chargé d'affaires of the US Embassy in Indonesia made a barbaric request to the Indonesian government, demanding that US paratroopers and navy land in Bagan Siapi-api, a strategic location and oil center in central Sumatra. The US chargé d'affaires' excuse, like all the excuses used by imperialists to launch aggression, was to "protect" the American expatriates and American enterprises there. At that time, Bagan Siapi-api was still in the hands of the rebels. The United States conspired to directly send troops and join forces with the rebel groups to obstruct the Indonesian government forces' offensive and further strengthen the rebel groups' momentum, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of overthrowing the Indonesian government.

    The Indonesian government resolutely rejected the US request and quickly sent its own paratroopers to parachute into Bagan Siapi-api, launching attacks on the rebel groups around Bagan Siapi-api.

    Shortly after the liberation of Bagan Siapi-api, I and a group of foreign journalists went there at the invitation of the Army Information Office. The materials obtained by the reporters on the scene proved that the US conspiracy revealed by the newspapers was completely true. Here is just one small episode, which is enough to show that the American conspiracy had been arranged long ago. Some Indonesian officers who participated in the paratroop operation told us that before the Indonesian paratroopers liberated Bagan Siapi-api, many American reporters had rushed to Bagan Siapi-api from Singapore and Padang, which was occupied by the rebels. Because they thought, based on the notice they received from the US government, that American soldiers would land in Bagan Siapi-api immediately. So when the Indonesian paratroopers landed in Bagan Siapi-api, some American reporters were already waiting at the airport. They rushed up and competed with unprecedented enthusiasm to shake hands and hug this group of paratroopers. But when they faced each other, they were greatly disappointed. It turned out that it was not American soldiers who had parachuted in, but Indonesian government forces. This can only be blamed on their own lack of information.

    We also visited the weapons airdropped by the United States in Bagan Siapi-api, and spent most of the day touring the oil fields exploited by the American Texaco oil company, meeting the company's American manager. This company was the ringleader of the United States in providing assistance to the rebel groups. Its ships transported military supplies to the rebel groups and sheltered American officers to serve as "instructors" for the rebels, teaching them how to use rocket launchers and other American weapons. When we were in Bagan Siapi-api, it was said that there was also a US Navy officer disguised as an oil company employee, living in that oil company with great fanfare.

    There are many tricks used by the United States to interfere in Indonesia, but roughly speaking, they are nothing more than these two: hard or soft, or a combination of both. But no matter how it changes, in the final analysis, it always opposes the independence and unity of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people are very wary of the actions of the United States. The newspapers here have repeatedly pointed out that the United States' acts of aggression and interference in Indonesia will never stop, no matter what tricks it plays on the surface.

    Now the people of the Moluccas regard Pope and American military supplies as specimens of American imperialist aggression. Whenever they talk about these, they grit their teeth. In our travel group to the Moluccas, the most unpopular person was probably that American reporter. Some people stared at him and called him "Pope," while some Indonesian officers smiled on the surface but patted him heavily on the back, saying "Pope" with each pat, or asking "Pope, how are you?" with each pat, and the American reporter could only endure it with an embarrassed red face.

    Resolutely Demand the Liberation of West Irian
    We traveled in a diagonal triangle on the sea in southern Moluccas, reaching Saumlaki, the southernmost part of the Moluccas, and then Dobo, the easternmost part and closest to West Irian. Then we headed northwest from Dobo and, on our way to Ambon, visited Saparua, the hometown of the national hero Pattimura and the place where he resisted the Dutch invaders.

    The towns on these islands are very beautiful. They are surrounded by mountains and the sea, covered by lush tropical trees, and decorated with lanterns and immersed in a festive atmosphere to welcome President Sukarno's arrival. People wore colorful national costumes, danced various Moluccan and West Irian dances, and held large-scale mass rallies to welcome President Sukarno.

    In Ambon and on the islands we visited, the people's demand for the liberation of West Irian was so strong that there were slogans, banners, and speeches about demanding the liberation of West Irian and condemning imperialism and colonialism everywhere. In Dobo on Yaro Island, the closest island to West Irian, this fervent atmosphere reached its peak.

    At the mass rally, the people of Dobo carried densely packed banners with slogans such as "Crush the evil Dutch colonialists, who separate our parents, brothers, and sisters," "Moluccan youths, rise up, now is the time to liberate West Irian!" In a group of women, they held high stirring banners: "For the liberation of West Irian, we are willing to be widows!" Representatives made impassioned speeches, sang newly composed songs, and shouted "Merdeka (Independence)!" towards West Irian continuously for several minutes.

    The urgent desire of the people of Yaro Island to liberate West Irian as soon as possible is understandable, because for them, this is not only to liberate their own territory, but also to liberate their hometown and their relatives. Yaro Island and West Irian are only dozens of miles apart, and it takes only six or seven hours to sail by boat. In the past, the Yaro people often went to West Irian to farm. There were fields and plantations cultivated by the Yaro people in West Irian, as well as relatives and friends of the Yaro people, and people from West Irian also often came to Yaro Island to visit relatives. Because the Netherlands refused to return West Irian, these two inseparable places are now forcibly separated.

    President Sukarno's visit greatly encouraged the Moluccan people's will to liberate West Irian and struck a blow at the imperialists' divisive conspiracies. Every one of his speeches and talks told everyone that one cannot beg for anything from imperialism. In order to recover West Irian, there must be practical actions, which is to strengthen unity and organize strength.

    The eleven-day trip to the Moluccas left most people with a deep impression: the firm will of the people living on this remote and scattered archipelago to oppose imperialism is inviolable. (Attached picture)

    访问马鲁古
    沈定一
    色彩明朗的马鲁古
    11月初，我们到了印度尼西亚马鲁古省的首府安汶。飞机在一片青山绿水之间缓缓下降。越往下降，色彩越浓越绿。漫山遍野的椰子树、棕榈树和硕莪树（一种树心可作粮食的树木，硕莪是马鲁古人民的主要粮食，因此有人叫它“面包树”）迎面扑来。海湾在夕阳下金光闪烁。
    我们在山与海之间的巴蒂慕拉飞机场上降落了。穿着粉红和大红衫裙的姑娘们在机场上载歌载舞，一队绻发的小伙子正在起劲地合奏着竹笛。
    从安汶开始，我们改乘船只，在美丽的马鲁古海上航行了一个多星期。
    马鲁古群岛共有九百九十七个大小岛屿，合起来的陆地总面积不过八万多平方公里，人口不超过一百万，但岛屿之间的海洋面积却比陆地面积大十倍以上，所以马鲁古的海产品——鱼、贝壳和珍珠等非常丰富。岛上则主要产丁香、豆蔻和椰干，普通人主要是以硕莪树心当粮食。大米和日用百货都要从外地运来。
    马鲁古的地位非常重要。它东面紧靠荷兰占领的西伊里安，北面和菲律宾相望，南面不远处是澳大利亚，只有西面靠着自己的国土——苏拉威西和努沙登拉省的一些岛屿。十七世纪时，荷兰侵入印度尼西亚的第一个落脚点就是安汶。第二次世界大战期间，日本帝国主义在马鲁古的一些岛屿上建立了南太平洋上的重要军事基地。现在，马鲁古又成为印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义干涉和收复西伊里安的前哨阵地。
    一年来，马鲁古的人民和军队经受了重大的考验。当今年年初北苏拉威西叛乱活动猖獗的时候，马鲁古曾经是帝国主义和叛乱集团力图夺取的对象，他们曾经几次想在马鲁古发动政变。但他们的阴谋失败了。之后，叛乱集团渡海侵占了马鲁古北部的一些地方，来自美国空军基地的美国飞机也开始对马鲁古进行了残酷的轰炸，企图迫使马鲁古军民屈服。但是马鲁古的军民没有低头，他们收复了失地，打下了美国轰炸机，活捉了美国飞行员鲍普，使美国武装干涉印度尼西亚的罪行大白于天下。
    我们是跟随苏加诺总统到马鲁古去访问的，苏加诺总统还邀请了十二个国家驻印度尼西亚的大使和公使同行，其中有我国大使黄镇，苏联大使沃尔科夫。苏加诺总统这次访问马鲁古有重大的意义，据他说，这是来感谢马鲁古人民坚持统一、反对分裂的功劳的。
    美国空中强盗欠下的血债
    一到马鲁古，美国空中强盗鲍普就首先成为大家谈论的中心。为了这件事，我在旅途中特地访问了马鲁古和西伊里安防区司令皮埃特斯中校。
    “马鲁古人民恨透了鲍普，”皮埃特斯中校的谈话是这样开头的。他举例说，当把鲍普解到安汶来的时候，成千成万人等在码头上要揍死这个美国杀人犯，要不是军警竭力劝阻，即使十个鲍普也被揍死了。鲍普押送到雅加达后，人民又急不可待地要求审判他，几次打电报给中央政府要求把他判处死刑。
    皮埃特斯接着细致地谈了俘掳鲍普的经过。5月18日清晨，皮埃特斯中校率领部队去进攻被叛乱集团占领的摩罗泰，他们刚从安汶坐船出发的时候，鲍普就驾驶着B—26型轰炸机来袭击他们。一颗炸弹在皮埃特斯中校乘坐的指挥船的三十公尺外爆炸。但是，这架飞机立刻被打落了。鲍普和一个印度尼西亚叛军飞行员跳伞逃命，但他们终于在安汶附近的一个小岛上被活捉了。连同鲍普的飞机在内，马鲁古的政府军一共打下了三架美国飞机，还活捉了一个蒋帮飞行员。
    从鲍普身上搜出了全部非常重要的文件。几个月前我曾在雅加达的一家旅馆里看到过这些文件的一部分，这是陆军方面陈列给记者们看的。其中有掩护鲍普身份的台北美国人的航空运输公司的证书，也有说明他是道地的美国空军人员的证章等物。另外还有些文件是不公开的。据报纸揭露，这些文件中有一份是美国驻琉球群岛的军事司令部给鲍普的命令，指定鲍普担任帮助印度尼西亚叛军的“临时”任务。这就非常清楚，实际上，轰炸马鲁古和印度尼西亚东部其它地方的就是美国空军。
    皮埃特斯接着算了一笔这个美国飞贼欠下的血债：炸死四百个马鲁古人，炸沉轮船三艘，炸伤七艘，还炸毁了许多民房、学校、教堂和市场，许多人还是在睡梦中被炸死的。
    不仅如此，鲍普的手上也沾满了我们中国同胞的鲜血。读者大概还记得，在半年以前，停泊在安汶港口外的两艘香港船——“飞雁号”和“摩洛号”被炸，有几十个中国船员被炸死炸伤。现在真相大白，原来这也是鲍普干的。
    皮埃特斯中校在谈话里还揭露了另外一个事实，就是美国大规模地输送武器给叛乱集团。叛军就是拿着簇新的美国枪炮来攻打马鲁古的。这位中校说，当他率领军队解放摩罗泰的时候，在叛军手中缴获了大批美国武器，还缴获了一幅很大的美国旗。俘虏供认，这面美国旗是为了对空联络用的。这面旗现在已送到首都民族委员会中去保存。
    从上面这些如山铁证中，可以看出当时美帝国主义对印度尼西亚的干涉已猖狂到了什么程度。
    美国的坏名声
    今年3月，当印度尼西亚政府军将要向苏门答腊中部的叛乱集团展开规模较大的攻势的时候，美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆代办却向印度尼西亚政府提出了一个蛮横的要求，就是要派美国伞兵和海军在苏门答腊中部的战略要地和石油中心巴干峇鲁登陆。美国代办的借口同所有帝国主义发动侵略的借口一样，就是所谓要“保护”那里的美国侨民和美国企业。那时巴干峇鲁还在叛军手里。美国阴谋直接出兵和叛乱集团合流，以阻挠印度尼西亚政府军的进攻，并且进一步壮大叛乱集团的声势，以达到推翻印度尼西亚政府的最后目的。
    印度尼西亚政府断然拒绝了美国的要求，而且迅速派出自己的伞兵空降巴干峇鲁，向巴干峇鲁四周的叛军展开了攻击。
    巴干峇鲁解放不久，我曾和一群外国记者在陆军新闻处的邀请下到了那里。记者们在现场得到的材料证明，报纸所揭发的美国的阴谋是完全真实的。这里只举一个小小的插曲，就足以说明美国的阴谋是早已安排好了的。一些参加空降的印度尼西亚军官告诉我们，在印度尼西亚伞兵解放巴干峇鲁之前，就有许多美国记者从新加坡和叛军占领的巴东赶到巴干峇鲁。因为他们根据从美国官方得到的通知，以为美国兵立刻就要在巴干峇鲁空降。所以当印度尼西亚伞兵在巴干峇鲁降落的时候，一些美国记者早已等候在飞机场上了，他们一拥而上，以空前的热情争着要同这批空降部队握手拥抱。但是等到面对面的时候，他们才大失所望。原来空降的不是美国兵而是印度尼西亚的政府军。这只能怨他们自己消息太不灵通了。
    我们在巴干峇鲁也参观了美国空投武器，并且在美国德士古石油公司开采的油田区里逛了大半天，见到了这个公司的美国经理。这个公司就是美国接济叛乱集团的窝主，它的船只给叛乱集团运送军火，又掩护美国军官去充当叛军的“教官”，教叛军怎样去使用火箭筒等等美国武器。我们在巴干峇鲁的时候，据说还有一个美国海军军官司装石油公司职员，堂而皇之地住在那家石油公司里。
    美国干涉印度尼西亚的花样是很多的，但大致讲来不外乎这两种：硬的或软的，或者软硬兼施。但万变不离其宗，归根结底，它总是敌视印度尼西亚人民的独立和统一。印度尼西亚人民对美国的行径是很警惕的。这里的报纸屡次指出，美国对印度尼西亚的侵略和干涉活动决不会停止，不管它在表面上耍什么花样。
    现在马鲁古人民把鲍普和美国军火当做美帝国主义侵略的标本，一谈起这些，个个咬牙切齿。在我们这个到马鲁古去的旅行团里，最不受欢迎的大概就是那个美国记者了。有些人紧钉着他叫“鲍普”，有些印度尼西亚军官面上笑着，手掌却重重地拍在他的背脊上，拍一下叫一句“鲍普”，或者拍一下问一声“鲍普好不好？”，这个美国记者却只有尴尬地红着脸孔忍受了。
    坚决要求解放西伊里安
    我们在马鲁古南部海面上走了个斜三角形，到了马鲁古最南面的桑姆拉吉，又到了最东边的也是最靠近西伊里安的杜波，再由杜波西北行，在快到安汶的时候，访问了民族英雄巴蒂慕拉的故乡和他抗击荷兰侵略者的所在地萨波洛亚。
    这些岛屿上的城镇非常美丽。它们都被山海环抱着，由浓绿的热带树木掩盖着，为了迎接苏加诺总统的到来，又都张灯结彩、沉浸在一片节日的气氛里。人们穿着色彩鲜艳的民族服装，跳着各种各样的马鲁古和西伊里安的舞蹈，举行了规模盛大的群众大会来欢迎苏加诺总统。
    在安汶以及在我们到达的这些岛屿上，人民要求解放西伊里安的情绪是那么强烈，到处都是关于要求解放西伊里安和谴责帝国主义和殖民主义的口号、标语和演说。在最靠近西伊里安的亚罗岛上的杜波，这种热烈的情绪达到了顶点。
    在群众大会上杜波人民抬着密密层层的标语，上面写着“粉碎罪恶的荷兰殖民主义者，它使我们的父母兄弟姊妹分离”，“马鲁古青年们起来，现在是解放西伊里安的时候了！”在一群妇女队伍里，她们高举着激昂的标语：“为了解放西伊里安我们情愿作寡妇！”代表们发表了慷慨激昂的演说，高唱着自己作的新歌，面向西伊里安连续几分钟不停地高呼“默地卡（独立）！”
    亚罗岛上的人民希望赶快解放西伊里安的迫切心情是可以理解的，因为对他们来说，这不仅是解放自己的国土，而且也是解放自己的家乡和自己的亲人。亚罗岛和西伊里安相隔只有几十哩，坐船飘海六七个钟头就到了。以前，亚罗人常到西伊里安去种地，西伊里安上面有亚罗人垦植过的田地和种植园，也有亚罗人的亲戚朋友，而西伊里安岛上的人也常到亚罗岛上来走亲戚。由于荷兰拒不交还西伊里安，现在这两个不可分割的地方硬是被分割了。
    苏加诺总统的访问大大鼓舞了马鲁古人民解放西伊里安的意志，打击了帝国主义的分裂阴谋。他的每次演说和谈话都告诉大家，对帝国主义不能乞求。为了收复西伊里安必须要有实际的行动，这就是加强团结和组织力量。
    在马鲁古十一天的旅行，使多数人都有一个深刻的印象：住在这个偏远而分散的群岛上的人民的反对帝国主义的坚强意志是不可侮的。（附图片）
