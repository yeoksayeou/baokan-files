Xinhua News Agency, Amsterdam, 30th Dispatch: The 19th Congress of the Dutch Communist Party concluded on the 29th. The congress was held in an atmosphere of soaring political enthusiasm and unity throughout the party. The delegates discussed the tasks facing the party and fully endorsed the policies of the party and the Central Committee headed by Groot, which are to wage a relentless struggle against revisionism, uphold Marxist-Leninist theory, mobilize the masses to counter the attacks of the Dutch reactionaries on the living standards and democratic rights of the working people, and strive for peace and socialism.

    Many delegates cited new facts about the destructive activities of the Wijnkoop-Gorter revisionist group in their speeches. The congress thoroughly exposed the true colors of the Dutch revisionists and dealt them a devastating blow.

    The congress unanimously adopted the draft of the new Party Constitution and elected a new Central Committee with complete unanimity.

    The congress, in a unanimously adopted "Letter to All Urban and Rural Workers, to All the Dutch People," pointed out: "The current situation poses a great threat to the vital interests of all working people. For the first time since the end of World War II, our country is ruled by a right-wing government. What many supporters of the Labor Party thought impossible has happened, and our Communist Party has been warning about this for several years." The document went on to state, "It is not enough to be merely uneasy. It must be expressed in action. The power of the people must stand up against the forces of reaction. The main slogan now should be: Stand with the Communists, oppose the right!"

    The delegates attending the congress called for cuts in military spending, shorter terms of service, and not sending Dutch troops to West Irian, and returning West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia. The congress opposed the establishment of American rocket bases in the Netherlands, advocated Dutch participation in a nuclear-free zone, advocated a permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing, a complete ban on the use of such weapons, and advocated expanding trade between East and West.

    In their discussions and speeches, the delegates paid close attention to the organizational work of the election campaign, as the Dutch reactionaries insisted on holding parliamentary elections ahead of schedule on March 12 next year. The "Letter to All Urban and Rural Workers, to All the Dutch People" pointed out that "much in the country depends on the outcome of the upcoming elections. A victory for the Communist Party in the elections will be the heaviest blow we can inflict on the right-wing group. We must devote all our strength to this. Forward, into battle!"

    Comrade Groot, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, emphasized in his closing remarks that the congress was filled with an atmosphere of harmony and unity. Groot said, "Armed with the resolutions of this congress, we will confidently complete the tasks before us!"

    At a special session of the congress, a documentary film about the life and activities of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the great leader of the international proletariat and the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, was shown. This was a gift from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Comrade Vergeer, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party, called on all activists and comrades attending the congress to use this film to educate the entire party in the spirit of the immortal Marxist-Leninist doctrine and to resolutely defend the principles of Leninism.

    The congress received congratulatory telegrams from many fraternal Communist and Workers' parties. The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, on behalf of the Indonesian Communists and working people, thanked the Dutch Communist Party for its firm support in the Dutch Parliament for the Indonesian people's demand for the liberation of West Irian. Many congratulatory telegrams protested the Dutch authorities' ban on the attendance of representatives of fraternal parties at the congress.

    政治热情高涨  全党团结一致
    荷共十九次代表大会胜利闭幕
    决定要同修正主义进行无情斗争
    准备给反动派的进攻以有力反击
    新华社30日讯  据塔斯社阿姆斯特丹消息：荷兰共产党第十九次代表大会已经在29日闭幕。这次代表大会是在政治热情高涨和全党团结一致的情况下进行的，代表们讨论了党所面临的任务，完全拥护党以及以格鲁特为首的党中央委员会的政策，这些政策是要同修正主义作无情的斗争，维护马克思列宁主义理论，动员群众反击荷兰反动派对劳动人民生活水平和民主权利的进攻，争取和平和社会主义。
    许多代表在发言中都举出魏吉纳—戈查克修正主义集团破坏活动的新的事实。代表大会彻底撕破了荷兰修正主义者的假面具，并且给他们以毁灭性的打击。
    代表大会一致通过党的新党章草案，并且意见完全一致地选举了新的中央委员会。
    代表大会在一致通过的“告全体城乡劳动人民、告全体荷兰人民书”中指出：“现在的局势对全体劳动人民的切身利益有着极大的威胁。在第二次世界大战结束后，我国第一次由右翼政府执政。许多拥护劳工党的人认为不可能发生的事情已经发生了，而我们共产党好几年来就已对这点提出了警告。”文件接着指出，“仅仅不安是不够的。应该把它表现在行动中。人民的力量应该同反动势力相对抗。现在主要的口号应该是：同共产党员在一起，反对右派！”
    参加代表大会的代表们要求削减军费，缩短服役期限，不要把荷兰军队派到西伊里安去，把西伊里安还给印度尼西亚共和国。代表大会反对在荷兰建立美国火箭基地，主张荷兰参加无原子武装地区，主张永远停止核武器试验，绝对禁止使用这种武器，主张扩大东西方之间的贸易。
    代表们在讨论和发言中都很注意选举运动的组织工作，因为荷兰反动派硬要提前在明年3月12日举行议会选举。“告全体城乡劳动人民、告全体荷兰人民书”指出，“全国的很多方面取决于即将到来的选举的结果。共产党在选举中的胜利将是我们能够给予右翼集团的最沉重的打击。我们必须为此付出全部力量。前进，投入战斗！”
    荷兰共产党中央委员会总书记格鲁特同志在致闭幕词时特别强调指出代表大会上充满了融洽一致的气氛。格鲁特说，“用这次代表大会的决议武装起来的我们，将满怀信心地来完成我们所面临的任务！”
    在代表大会的特别会议上，放映了有关国际无产阶级的伟大领袖、共产党和苏维埃国家的奠基人拉弗基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的生平活动的纪录片。这是苏联共产党中央委员会赠送的礼物。荷兰共产党中央委员会书记费尔吉同志号召参加大会的全体积极分子和全体同志利用这部影片，以不朽的马克思列宁主义学说的精神教育全党，坚决捍卫列宁主义的原则。
    代表大会收到许多兄弟共产党和工人党的贺电。印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会的贺电，代表印度尼西亚的共产党员和劳动人民，感谢荷兰共产党在荷兰议会中坚决支持印度尼西亚人民关于解放西伊里安的要求。许多贺电对荷兰当局禁止兄弟党的代表出席代表大会的行为提出抗议。
