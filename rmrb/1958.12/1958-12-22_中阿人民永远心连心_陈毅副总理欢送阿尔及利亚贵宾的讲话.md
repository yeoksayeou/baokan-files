Respectable guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, respectable Minister Mahmoud Chérif, respectable Minister Ben Youcef Ben Khedda, friends, comrades:

Today, with infinite reluctance, we bid farewell to the distinguished guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Although your stay in China has been short, it has left an unforgettable impression on the hearts of the Chinese people. As you are about to embark on your journey home, I once again, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, express my heartfelt gratitude for your gracious visit.

During your visit to China, you personally witnessed the warm welcome of the Chinese people to the envoys of the Algerian people. The Chinese people thank you for bringing the lofty friendship of the Algerian people. The delegation of your government held friendly and cordial talks with the leaders of our government, and the two governments have issued a joint communiqué on the current international situation, especially the situation of the struggle in Algeria and the development of relations between the two countries. Your visit has made a significant contribution to the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the governments and peoples of China and Algeria, and will also help to further promote friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries.

Dear friends, you are about to part with us. Please convey to the Algerian people that the hearts of the Chinese people will forever be closely linked with yours. Your heroic struggle against colonialism and for national independence will always have the resolute support of the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the heroic Algerian people will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve the final victory in their national liberation struggle.

Goodbye, and wish you a safe journey!

Long live the victory of the Algerian people's national liberation struggle!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!

Long live world peace!

    亲爱的朋友们，你们马上就要同我们分手了，请你们转告阿尔及利亚人民：中国人民的心将永远同你们的心紧紧地连在一起，你们的反殖民主义、争取民族独立的英勇斗争，将永远得到中国人民的坚决支持。我们深信，英雄的阿尔及利亚人民一定能够克服一切困难，取得民族解放斗争的最后胜利。
    再见吧，祝贵宾们一路平安！
