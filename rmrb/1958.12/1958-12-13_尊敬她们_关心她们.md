    Respect Them, Care for Them
    Zhang Ke
    In our society, there are already many people engaged in collective welfare undertakings. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the establishment of the people's communes, even more people are involved in collective endeavors. The tens of millions of cooks and childcare workers in the people's communes are among them.
    Most of these people are women who have just been liberated from household chores, or young girls who have never handled household affairs before. For these tedious and unfamiliar tasks, they not only bravely took them on but also strived to study the work and learn techniques, trying every means to do their jobs well. To ensure that commune members work and rest on time, they rise before dawn and sleep late at night, even thinking about their work in their dreams. To make the food better, they carefully observe the preferences of the commune members, understand their needs, and then try to make food that suits their tastes and requirements. To ensure that commune members eat better, they raise pigs and chickens, also working as feeders. To allow commune members to rest more, they deliver meals to the fields. The young girls working in nurseries, though lacking experience, are striving to learn childcare knowledge and carefully taking care of the children, making their lives happy and lively. The old ladies care for the children like they care for their own grandchildren, preferring to go hungry and suffer hardships themselves rather than letting the children suffer in the slightest. In short, these people are trying every means to dedicate their wisdom and strength to the cause of social welfare.
    Why are these people so enthusiastic about collective welfare undertakings? This is because they have extraordinary insights and lofty ideals. They understand that the work they are engaged in is a noble endeavor to serve the people. They understand that living welfare work is an indispensable part of the people's communes. Doing a good job in living welfare not only makes everyone's life better, their mood comfortable, and their spirits high, which can fully stimulate their enthusiasm for labor and better carry out production; but also can continuously strengthen the communist ideology of commune members through collective life. They understand that while it's the same thing to cook and take care of children, the meaning is completely different. In the past, whether it was done well or not only affected one family, but now it affects the activities of the commune. As they themselves said: "Turning around the stove is the same, but it's different at home and in the commune." Similarly, cooking and taking care of children is not the same as serving people in the past. In the past, they were serving people who did not work for their food, and the laborers themselves were also despised. Now it is mutual service, serving laborers who contribute to society and are respected.
    For such people, we should not only respect them but also provide them with all kinds of assistance. For example, establishing canteens and nurseries in rural areas is a new task, so there are still many problems in the work, which requires everyone to solve together. Those with experience contribute their experience, those with technology impart their technology.... Only in this way can canteens and nurseries be run better and meet everyone's requirements.
    Now many cooks and childcare workers are working tirelessly, and as leading cadres of the commune, we must also care about their health and ensure that they eat well, sleep well, and rest well.

    尊敬她们  关心她们
    张克
    在我们这个社会里从事于集体福利事业的人本来是很多的，大跃进，特别是人民公社化以后，从事于集体事业的人更多、人民公社的几千万名炊事员，保育员就是其中一部分。
    这些人大都是刚刚从家务劳动中解放出来的妇女，或者是从来没有操持过家务的年青姑娘，对于这样繁琐而陌生的任务，她们不但勇敢地承担起来，而且努力钻研业务、学习技术，想尽一切办法把自己的工作做好。为了保证社员们按时作息，她们起五更、睡半夜，甚至做梦的时候也惦记着自己的工作。为了把饭菜做好，她们细心地体察社员的爱好，了解社员的要求，而后尽量做出适合社员爱好和要求的饭菜来。为了使社员吃得更好，她们喂猪喂鸡，兼做了饲养员。为了使社员多休息一会，她们把饭菜送到田间。托儿所作保育工作的年青姑娘虽然还缺乏经验，但她们努力学习保育知识，经心照顾着儿童，使孩子们过着愉快活泼的生活。老太太更像爱护自己的儿孙一样照顾着孩子，宁肯自己挨饿受累，也不使孩子受一点屈。总之，这些人是在想一切办法，把智慧和力量献给了社会福利事业。
    这些人为什么这样热心于集体福利事业呢？这因为她们有着卓越的见地和远大的理想，她们懂得自己所从事的工作，是为人民服务的一种崇高的工作。她们懂得生活福利工作是人民公社不可缺少的工作，搞好生活福利工作，不但使大家生活过得好，心情舒畅，精神饱满，可以充分发挥劳动积极性，更好地搞好生产；而且可以通过集体生活不断增强社员的共产主义思想。她们懂得：同样是做饭带孩子，但意义却完全不同。过去做得好坏只影响一家，现在会影响公社的活动。正如她们自己所说的：“同样围着锅台转，在家在社不一般。”同样是做饭带孩子，和过去的侍候人不一样。过去侍候的是一些不劳而食的人，而劳动者本身也是被人轻视的。现在是互相侍候，侍候的都是对社会有贡献而受到尊敬的劳动者。
    对于这样的人，我们不但要尊敬，而且要给以各种各样的帮助。例如在农村建立食堂、托儿所是一件新的工作，所以工作问题还是很多的，这就需要大家一起来解决。有经验的献出经验，有技术的传授技术……。只有这样，食堂、托儿所才能办得更好，才能符合大家的要求。
    现在许多炊事员、保育员在不眠不休地工作，作为公社的领导干部，同样要关心他们的身体，同样要保证她们吃好、睡好、休息好。
