    The play is over, and the audience goes to the cloakroom to get their coats, put them on, and leave. Recently, there have been more and more people like this in the audience. After receiving their clothes from the cloakroom attendant, they don't just leave. Instead, they smile and nod to the attendant, saying "Thank you." Lately, I have also seen many people thanking the salesperson or saying goodbye to the gatekeeper when leaving a store or after visiting a place.

    It is a formality, but behind the formality, there is content. It is politeness, but behind politeness, there is thought. Here, there is the question of attitude towards service personnel; it is equal, not condescending. Here, there is the question of how we view service industries; we should not see a chasm of high and low status between service industries and other industries.

    In class society, the exploiting class does not labor, enjoys everything for nothing, and oppresses the laborers, yet looks down upon the laborers who support them. In a society where the ideology of the exploiting class occupies a dominant position, the working people are also ideologically branded by this kind of thinking and often regard service labor as "inferior."

    In our socialist society, the exploiting classes have been eliminated, and the ideology of the working people has been liberated. In shops, canteens, and all public places, the relationship between those engaged in service work and the so-called served is equal. Due to the change in social atmosphere and the improvement of the work of service personnel, we often see a family-like atmosphere between them. However, the remnants of old ideas cannot be completely and thoroughly eliminated overnight; they will still surface from time to time. The incident mentioned by Comrade Cheng Ke in the People's Daily supplement on the 4th of this month is a very illustrative example. The reason why that person quarreled in the car and then remained silent was simply because he had a concept of belittling service work in his mind. It should be said that this phenomenon is not isolated; it is incompatible with the great achievements of our country in construction and also hinders our socialist cause. We need to further promote socialist morality and make everyone a polite, thoughtful, and cultured person.

    Our Party advocates that cadres at all levels should appear as ordinary laborers and respect the working people. The Party has always opposed bureaucracy, officialdom, and putting on airs. From the news reports in the newspapers, we can often see how humble, kind, and amiable our Party leaders are in their interactions with the working people. From many revolutionary historical stories and memoirs, we can also read moving stories of how our leaders treated soldiers, orderlies, and cooks with warmth and consideration. We should learn from these vivid and glorious deeds.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao wrote a memorial article for Comrade Zhang Side, a soldier of the Central Guard Regiment who sacrificed himself while burning charcoal. In the article, Chairman Mao especially mentioned ordinary soldiers and cooks. He taught us that regardless of what work people do or what their status is, as long as they are "working thoroughly for the interests of the people," they should be cared for and valued. If a person dies for the interests of the people, such a death is heavier than Mount Tai. The title of this article is "Serve the People." Chairman Mao used the opportunity of mourning the death of a soldier to explain to us the noble thought of serving the people.

    Salespersons, ticket sellers, cooks... many practitioners in service industries may be unknown, but they are engaged in a noble cause, the socialist cause, the cause of human liberation; they are practitioners of Chairman Mao's thought of serving the people. Let us pay our respects to them!

    在衣帽间所见
    春城
    散戏了，观众纷纷到衣帽间去取大衣，穿上，走了。近来，观众中这样的人却多起来了，当他们从衣帽间服务员手中接过衣服后，并不就那么完事大吉，而是一边向服务员微笑颔首，一边说了声谢谢。近来，我也看到很多人在商店买了东西，或者参观了一个地方之后，在离开的时候，往往还要向售货员道谢，向守门人员告别。
    是形式，但形式背后有内容。是礼貌，但礼貌背后有思想。这里有对服务人员的态度问题，是平等的，而不是居“高”临“下”的。这里有对服务性行业的看法问题，不应把服务性行业和其他行业之间看作有高低贵贱的鸿沟。
    在阶级社会里，剥削阶级不劳动，白享受，还要压迫劳动者，却反而看不起供养他们的劳动者。在剥削阶级的思想占有统治地位的社会里，劳动人民在思想上也受到这种思想的烙印，也往往把服务性的劳动看作是“下等”的。
    在我们社会主义社会里，剥削阶级消灭了，劳动人民的思想解放了。在商店里、食堂里、一切公共场所里，从事服务工作的人和所谓被服务者的关系是平等的，由于社会风气的改变由于服务人员的工作的改进，我们经常看到他们彼此之间有了一种亲如一家的气氛。但是旧思想的残余不可能一朝一夕就完全彻底清除，它们还会不时冒出头来。本月4日人民日报副刊程克同志文中所谈到的一件事就是个很能说明问题的例子。那个人所以要在车里吵起来，而后来又默无一言，无非是由于他脑子里有一个轻视服务性工作的观念在作怪。应该说，这种现象还不是个别的，它同我们的国家在建设方面的伟大成就是不相称的，也是对我们社会主义事业有妨碍的。我们需要更进一步地发扬社会主义的道德风尚，要使大家成为有礼貌、有思想、有文化的人。
    我们党提倡各级干部要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，要尊重劳动人民。党一向反对官僚主义、官气、摆架子。从报纸的通讯中我们常常可以看到我们党的领导人怎样谦逊、亲切、和霭地和劳动人民相处。从许多革命的历史故事、回忆录中，也可以读到我们的领袖怎样热情、体贴地对待战士、勤务员、炊事员……的令人感动的故事。我们应该从这些生动的光辉的事迹中吸取教训。
    在抗日战争的年代里，毛主席曾经为一个因烧炭而牺牲的中央警卫团的战士张思德同志写了追悼的文章。在文章里，毛主席特别提到了普通的战士和炊事员。他教导我们：不管人们做什么工作，地位如何，只要是“彻底地为人民的利益工作的”，就应该关心他们，重视他们。如果一个人是为人民利益而死的，这样的死就比泰山还重。这篇文章的题目就叫“为人民服务”。毛主席借追悼一个战士的死的机会，为我们阐明了为人民服务的高尚思想。
    售货员、售票员、炊事员……许多服务性行业的从业员，他们可能是默默无闻的，但他们所从事的是高贵的事业，社会主义事业，人类解放的事业，他们是毛主席的为人民服务思想的实行家。让我们向他们致敬吧！
