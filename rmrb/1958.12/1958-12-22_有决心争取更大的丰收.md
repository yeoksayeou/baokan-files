    Determined to Strive for Greater Harvests
    Li Fengcun, Chengguan People's Commune, Juye County, Shandong
    I am the instructor of the Iron Girls' Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Juye County, Shandong. I was truly delighted when I saw the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in the newspaper. This year, agriculture has achieved a great bumper harvest, with the yields of grain and cotton both doubling, something that has never happened before. Take our commune as an example. In the past, grain yields were only 200 to 300 jin per mu, but this year they have increased several times. The 1,162 mu of high-yield fields cultivated by our Iron Girls' Team averaged 2,441 jin per mu.
    The main reason we were able to achieve such a great bumper harvest this year is that the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has inspired us, enabling us young people to dare to think and dare to act, and to constantly struggle against conservative ideas. When we started to cultivate the thousand-mu high-yield fields, many people said we were making a fool of ourselves, but we were not discouraged. The township Party committee constantly supported us, helped us solve some difficulties, and helped us hire experienced farmers as technical advisors. We also encouraged each other, saying, "No matter how great the difficulties, our determination is greater. Thousands of difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, cannot defeat the Iron Girls." With our enthusiasm aroused, we continued to innovate technology and break old habits. For example, with sweet potatoes, we used to plant only 1,100 plants per mu, but now we plant 12,000 plants. In the past, plowing was only three or four inches deep, but now we plow three feet deep. After a year of hard work, we finally achieved a large-scale bumper harvest.
    This year's Great Leap Forward not only resulted in higher grain yields, but also greatly improved the thinking of us young people. Things we didn't dare to do in the past, we now dare to do, and we have learned a lot of skills and gained some production experience. Although we have achieved a great bumper harvest this year, we are not satisfied with our current achievements. Just as the communique says, we will make even greater leaps forward next year.
    Our commune has formulated a leap forward plan for next year based on the production policy of planting less and harvesting more. Our Iron Girls' Team plans to cultivate ten thousand mu of high-yield fields next year. We have already planted 6,500 mu of wheat, including ten mu of extremely high-yield fields and one thousand mu of large-scale high-yield fields. In order to achieve the leap forward plan, the wheat has been sown in deeply plowed land. Generally, the land is plowed one and a half feet deep, and the high-yield fields are plowed more than three feet deep; and sufficient base fertilizer is applied, averaging 130,000 jin per mu. Field management is currently being strengthened.
    Our commune has established a Red and Expert University, which has departments of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, etc., in order to improve the technical level of the commune members and strive for a greater harvest next year. During the rectification of the commune, a comprehensive and in-depth inspection should be carried out on the commune's production planning, distribution status, living welfare, business management, financial work, and organizational leadership. At the same time, the Party's organization and the commune's organization must be effectively consolidated to ensure that the leading members of the Party and the commune at all levels must be active elements who are loyal to the interests of the people and the cause of communism, and to absorb outstanding elements who have been tested in the Great Leap Forward and the communization movement and who meet the standards of Party members into the Party. -- Excerpt from the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes"

    有决心争取更大的丰收
    山东巨野县城关人民公社  李凤存
    我是山东巨野县城关人民公社钢铁姑娘团的指导员。我看到了报纸上登的党的八届六中全会的公报后，心里真是高兴。今年农业获得了大丰收，粮食、棉花的产量都翻一番，这是过去从来没有过的事。就拿我们公社来说，过去粮食每亩只有二、三百斤，今年却翻了几番。我们钢铁姑娘团搞的一千一百六十二亩丰产田，平均亩产二千四百四十一斤。
    今年我们能获得这样的大丰收，主要是党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞着我们，使我们青年人敢想敢干，不断跟保守思想作斗争。当我们开始搞千亩丰产田时，许多人说我们是胡闹，但我们并没有灰心。乡党委在不断地支持我们，并帮助解决一些困难，帮助我们聘请了老农作技术顾问。我们自己也互相鼓励说：“困难大没有决心大，千难万难，难不倒钢铁姑娘。”干劲鼓起来了，我们又不断革新技术，打破旧习惯。比如地瓜，过去每亩只栽一千一百棵，我们却栽了一万二千棵。过去翻地只有三、四寸，我们却翻了三尺深。经过我们一年来的苦战，终于获得了大面积丰收。
    今年的大跃进，不光是粮食打得多，主要的是我们青年人的思想大大提高了，过去不敢干的事，现在敢干了，并且学了不少本领，摸到一些生产经验。今年虽然获得大丰收，但我们并不满足现有成绩。正像公报上说的那样，明年还要作更大的跃进。
    我们公社已根据少种多收的生产方针，订出明年的跃进计划。我们这个钢铁姑娘团，明年计划搞万亩丰产田。现在已种下小麦六千五百亩，其中有十亩高额丰产田，有一千亩大面积丰产田。为了实现跃进计划，小麦都播在深翻地上。一般深翻一尺五寸，丰产田深翻三尺以上；并施足底肥，平均每亩合十三万斤。目前正在加强田间管理。
    我们社里办了红专大学，里面设有农业、林业、水利等系，以便提高社员的技术水平，争取明年更大的丰收。在进行整社的时候，要对公社的生产规划、分配状况、生活福利、经营管理、财务工作、组织领导，做一次全面的深入的检查。同时，要切实整顿党的组织和公社的组织，保证党和公社的各级领导成员必须是忠实于人民利益和共产主义事业的积极分子，并且吸收在大跃进运动和公社化运动中受过考验、合乎党员标准的优秀分子入党。——摘自“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”
