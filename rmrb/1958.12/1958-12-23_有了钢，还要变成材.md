Having 10.7 million tons of steel is in our hands! People are saying: our machine manufacturing, coal industry, transportation... and other industries will flourish everywhere under the leadership of steel. However, having steel does not equal having machines. Steel must be transformed into material, and then material into tools. How to turn steel into material? First, pressure processing is required.

Pressure processing is the method of using applied pressure to transform steel into various suitable shapes. The process of steel pressure processing generally involves heating the steel ingot in a heating furnace to 1000 to 1200 degrees Celsius, and then sending it to a rolling mill or forging hammer for pressing. This process of heating steel and then pressing it is called hot working. Round steel, square steel, angle steel, steel rolled products, and other shaped steel are produced by hot working. After hot working, the grain size of the steel becomes uniform and fine, which improves the quality of the steel and increases its strength and toughness. Sometimes, in order to produce thinner and finer steel materials such as thin plates and steel wires, it is also necessary to cold work the hot-rolled steel billets. Cold working does not require heating, only applying external force at room temperature to deform the steel. Cold working can make the surface of the steel smooth, increase its hardness, and make its length suitable.

Pressure processing includes several methods such as rolling, forging, stamping, and drawing. Among them, rolling steel is the most familiar to us. A rolling mill has two rollers, which are installed parallel to each other, one above and one below, on the machine frame, with a gap in between. During rolling, the rollers are first rotated, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Then, one end of the steel ingot to be rolled is inserted into the gap between the two rollers. Because friction occurs when the steel comes into contact with the surface of the rollers, the steel is carried forward. At the same time, the steel ingot is squeezed by the rollers, becoming thinner and longer. Because steel is easier to roll into various shapes at high temperatures, most shaped steels are hot-rolled. Cold rolling does not require heating, but cold rolling can only roll thinner steel materials, and the compression rate is also smaller.

Hammer forging is used more widely and earlier than rolling steel. Ancient weapons and farm tools were mostly forged by hammer. Hammer forging also requires heating the steel first, and then using it for hammering. Ordinary blacksmithing is free hammer forging, without molds. However, in factories, mold hammer forging is also used. The upper mold acts as a hammer head, and the lower mold acts as an anvil. Hammer forging can make steel into various complex shapes, and at the same time, during the hammer forging process, carbon and slag mixed in the steel can sometimes be squeezed out.

Hammer forging and rolling are the basic methods of turning steel into material, and stamping and drawing can be considered within the scope of turning material into tools. Stamping is to place the steel in a mold of a certain shape and press it hard with a punch. For example, the outer shell of a car is made in this way. Drawing is mainly used to make steel pipes and steel wires. This processing method requires the use of a drawing die.

Recently, Northeast Institute of Technology and other units have also successfully tested direct rolling of various steel materials from molten iron or molten steel. That is, pouring molten steel between two rotating cold rolling cylinders, solidifying on one side and rolling into sheet material on the other. Because this method does not require casting ingots first, it is called ingot-free rolling or liquid rolling. This is a very advanced method. It can not only save many processes, but also the equipment required is not complicated.

    有了钢，还要变成材
    王干一
    一千零七十万吨钢拿到手了！人们都说：我们的机器制造、煤炭工业、交通运输……等工业也将在钢帅的带动下遍地开花了。可是，有了钢并不等于就有了机器。必须变钢成材，然后才能变材为器。如何变成材呢？首先要进行压力加工。
    压力加工就是用施加压力的办法使钢变成各种适用的形状。钢的压力加工过程一般是先将钢锭在加热炉中加热到一千度至一千二百度，然后送到轧钢机或锻锤机上进行压制。这种把钢加热后再压制的过程就叫热加工。圆钢、方钢、角钢、钢轧品等型钢就是热加工出来的。经热加工后钢的晶粒均匀而细小，这就改善了钢的质量，提高了它的强度和韧性。有时为了制出更薄、更细的钢材如薄板、钢丝等，还需要把热轧出的钢坯进行冷加工。冷加工不需加热，只在室温下加外力使钢变形。冷加工能使钢的表面光滑、硬度增加和长短适宜。
    压力加工有轧、锻、冲、拉等几种方法。其中我们最熟悉的要算是轧钢了。轧钢机上有两根轧辊，两个轧辊一上一下平行地安在机架上，中间留有孔隙。在轧制时先把轧辊转动起来，一个顺时针方向转，另一个逆时针方向转。然后把要轧的钢锭的一端塞到两个轧辊之间的孔隙中。由于钢与轧辊表面接触时发生摩擦，所以钢被带向前进。同时钢锭受到轧辊的挤压，变得薄而长。因为钢在高温下比较容易轧成各种形状，所以大多数型钢都是热轧出来的。冷轧就不用加热了，但是冷轧只能轧较薄的钢料，压缩率也较小。
    锤锻比轧钢用得更普遍更早。古代所用的武器和农具多是锤锻成的。锤锻也需要先把钢加热，然后用来锤打。平常的打铁是自由锤锻，不用模型。但是在工厂里还采用模型锤锻的办法。模型的上模起锤头作用，下模起铁钻作用。锤锻可以把钢作成各种复杂的形状，同时在锤锻过程中有时还可以把掺杂在钢中的碳和渣挤出来。
    锤锻和轧制是变钢成材的基本方法，至于冲压和抽拉就可算在变材成器的范围里了。冲压是把钢放在一定形状的模子里用冲头猛压。例如汽车的外壳就是这样作成的。抽拉主要是用来作钢管和钢丝的，这种加工方法需要用拉模。
    最近东北工学院等单位还试验成功用铁水或钢液直接轧制成各种钢材。即把钢水倒在两个转动的冷轧筒之间，一面凝固，一面就轧成板材。因为这种方法不用先铸锭，所以称为无锭轧制或液态轧制。这是一种很先进的办法。它不但可以省掉很多工序，而且所需的设备也并不复杂。
