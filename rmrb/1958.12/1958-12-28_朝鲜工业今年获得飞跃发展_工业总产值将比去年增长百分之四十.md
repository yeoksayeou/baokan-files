Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 26th. 1958 is the year the Korean people have mounted the "Chollima," and all industrial sectors in Korea have experienced leap-forward development.

    Thanks to the hard work of the workers, Korea's total industrial output value plan for this year was completed ahead of schedule on December 3rd. According to "Rodong Sinmun," Korea's total industrial production value this year will increase by 40% compared to last year.

    In industry, due to the Korean Workers' Party's adherence to the economic policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry while also developing light industry and agriculture, heavy industry sectors have taken the lead in leaping forward. The production level of various heavy industry sectors in Korea, which were severely damaged during the war, has far exceeded pre-war levels today, more than five years after the armistice. Compared with 1949, the output value of Korea's metallurgical industry this year is about three times that of that time; the output value of the machinery industry is 5.7 times that of that time; and coal production exceeds 1949 by 60%.

    This year, Korea's heavy industry sectors have restored and newly built many important production facilities, including two blast furnaces in the iron and steel sector. The Supung Power Station and Changjin River Power Station, with power generation capacities of 700,000 kilowatts and 330,000 kilowatts respectively, have been restored and expanded. The Huichon Machine Tool Factory and Unsan Tool Factory, with an annual output of 2,000 to 3,000 machine tools, have been completed in the machinery industry sector this year. In the chemical industry sector, a new ammonium nitrate fertilizer plant has been built in the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory this year. The increase in these many important production facilities and the adoption of advanced production methods such as the iron-coke smelting method and hydraulic coal mining method have greatly increased the production capacity of Korea's various industrial sectors this year. This year, steel and iron production have increased by approximately 100,000 tons compared to last year; coal production will increase by more than 1.5 million tons compared to last year; cement production will reach 1 million tons; and chemical fertilizer will reach 440,000 tons.

    The workers in the machinery industry sector have broken with the idea of mystification, and have trial-produced many important products such as automobiles, tractors, and bulldozers this year, and will begin mass production from next year.

    The light industry sector has also developed rapidly this year. The silk fabrics produced by various factories under the Light Industry Ministry this year are equivalent to 2.4 times that of last year; the output of woolen fabrics is equivalent to 4.6 times that of last year; cotton fabrics will increase by 28% compared to last year; and daily necessities will increase by 68%.

    According to the decision of the Korean Workers' Party's June Plenary Session, more than 1,000 local factories have been newly built in various places, and these factories will be able to produce products worth 20 billion North Korean won this year.

    The variety of Korean light industrial products has also greatly increased this year. The number of light industrial products sold in the Pyongyang City Department Store under the Light Industry Ministry was 326 at the beginning of this year, and has increased to more than 2,000 by December.

    朝鲜工业今年获得飞跃发展
    工业总产值将比去年增长百分之四十
    新华社平壤26日电  1958年是朝鲜人民跨上“千里马”的一年，朝鲜各个工业部门都有飞跃的发展。
    由于工人们努力生产，朝鲜今年的工业总产值计划已经在12月3日提前完成。据“劳动新闻”报道，朝鲜今年的工业生产总值将比去年增长40％。
    在工业方面，由于朝鲜劳动党坚持执行优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业的经济政策，重工业各部门带头向前跃进。在战时遭到严重破坏的朝鲜重工业各部门的生产水平在停战后五年多的今天，已经远远超过了战前。同1949年相比，今年朝鲜冶金工业的产值大约相当于那时的三倍；机械工业的产值相当于那时的五点七倍；煤炭产量超过1949年60％。
    朝鲜重工业部门今年恢复和新建了许多重要的生产设备，其中包括钢铁部门的两座高炉；发电能力各为七十万瓩和三十三万瓩的水丰发电站和长津江发电站已经恢复和扩建完成；机械工业部门今年建成了年产两千到三千台机床的熙川机床厂和云山工具厂；化学工业部门今年在兴南肥料工厂中新建了一座氮铵肥料厂。这许多重要生产设备的增加和铁焦炼铁法、水力采煤法等先进生产方法的被采用，使朝鲜各工业部门的生产能力在今年内有了很大的增长。今年，钢和铁的产量都比去年增加了约十万吨；煤炭将比去年增加一百五十万吨以上；水泥产量将达一百万吨；化学肥料将达四十四万吨。
    机械工业部门的职工们打破了神秘化的思想，今年试制了汽车、拖拉机、推土机等许多重要产品，并且将从明年开始大量生产。
    轻工业部门今年也发展得很快。轻工业省所属各厂今年生产的丝织品相当于去年的二点四倍；毛织品产量相当于去年的四点六倍；棉织品比去年将增加28％；日用品将增加68％。
    根据朝鲜劳动党六月全会的决定，各地新建了一千多座地方工厂，这些工厂今年能够生产价值二百亿元朝币的产品。
    朝鲜轻工业产品的种类今年也大大增加。在轻工业省所属平壤市商店门市部中出售的轻工业品在今年年初是三百二十六种，到12月份已经增加到二千多种。
