Vigorously Develop Artificial Boards
Deputy Minister of Forestry Yong Wentao

    Under the situation of the overall Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, timber production has leaped forward again and again, but the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand is still quite serious. The reason why timber production cannot break through greater limits within a certain period is not only due to the many difficulties in the construction of timber enterprises, but also because the trunk line transportation for developing forest areas cannot keep up. Even if more timber is felled, it cannot be transported out.

    The above situation tells us that the timber industry must pass a hurdle. This hurdle is how to meet the growing demand for timber from the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and how to overcome the difficulties in timber production. How do we pass this hurdle? We believe that while actively building forest area roads, developing remote forest areas, and increasing timber production, we must also produce artificial boards in large quantities and actively promote the saving of timber. That is to say, we must increase sources and reduce expenditures, and do both simultaneously.

    Here we only talk about the issue of artificial boards. What is the position of artificial boards in timber supply, and how much role can they play? We have researched and analyzed the timber consumption during the First Five-Year Plan period. Do all building materials, furniture, packaging, and other timber uses necessarily require logs? No, a large proportion of them can be replaced by artificial boards. For example, 30% of building materials, 60% of packaging and furniture materials, and 20% of vehicle, ship, agricultural tool, and machinery materials can be replaced by artificial boards.

    The important role of developing artificial boards in large quantities lies in: First, it can fully utilize the remaining materials from timber harvesting and processing, such as branches, bark, board edges, and shavings. These remaining materials generally account for 30% of the log production volume. In the past, these remaining materials were discarded in the mountains, which was a great waste of timber resources. Developing artificial boards can turn these "waste materials" into useful materials, achieving rational utilization of forest resources. At the same time, it can also save investment in cleaning up forest farms and create favorable conditions for the renewal of felled areas.

    Second, the raw materials used for fiberboard and particleboard in artificial boards, in addition to the remaining materials from timber harvesting and processing, can also be made from one- and two-year-old shrubs, trees, and bamboos, and can also be made from herbaceous fibers such as cotton stalks, bagasse, reeds, and thatch. It is particularly worth mentioning that products made from one- and two-year-old shrub saplings and bamboo fibers are of equally excellent quality. In this way, relying on young forests and bamboo fibers that are not of great economic value at present can greatly replace timber, even faster than fast-growing tree species. Thus, we can free ourselves from the passive situation of relying on decades-old trees to solve the timber supply problem.

    Third, it can greatly save timber resources and alleviate the tight timber supply situation. One cubic meter of hard fiberboard is equivalent to 5.7 cubic meters of sawn timber made from logs. One cubic meter of particleboard is equivalent to 2 cubic meters of sawn timber made from logs. Therefore, every cubic meter of fiberboard or particleboard produced is equivalent to felling 5.7 or 2 cubic meters less of logs. It should also be pointed out that developing artificial boards can save investment, steel, and labor much more than increasing log production. For example, producing 22 million cubic meters of logs requires an investment of 1.6 billion yuan, 210,000 tons of steel, and 240,000 laborers; while producing artificial boards to replace 22 million cubic meters of logs only requires an investment of 600 million yuan, 110,000 tons of steel, and 210,000 laborers.

    Fourth, it can save expenses for the using departments and improve labor efficiency. According to foreign materials, using fiberboard and particleboard to make furniture can improve labor efficiency by 15%. According to materials from the Ministry of Commerce, using thick cardboard as packaging material can reduce packaging costs by 40%. The construction department also reflects that using artificial boards will greatly reduce costs.

    Next year, the development of artificial boards should focus on fiberboard, with appropriate development of particleboard and thick cardboard. This is because the auxiliary materials and machinery and equipment required for the production of fiberboard are easy to solve; other artificial boards are different. For example, the machinery required for thick cardboard is more complex and uses more steel; particleboard uses more glue, and the production of glue is currently in short supply. At the same time, fiberboard is not only richer in raw materials than other artificial boards, but also has a wider range of uses.

    In view of the above situation, we believe that in order to expand the utilization of forest resources, save forest resources, save the use of timber, and ensure construction needs, we must pass the hurdle of artificial boards next year, and vigorously develop the wood processing industry that can fully utilize logging and processing residues to manufacture artificial boards. This is the correct direction for the development of timber production.

    大力发展人造板
    林业部副部长  雍文涛
    在工农业全面大跃进的形势下，木材生产一跃再跃，但供不应求的现象仍相当严重。而一定时期内木材生产所以不能突破更大限度，不仅是由于木材企业建设方面存在着许多困难，也由于开发林区的干线交通跟不上去，即使多砍了木材也运不出来。
    上述情况告诉我们，木材工业必须过关。这个关就是如何满足工农业大跃进对木材日益增长的需要，如何克服木材生产中的困难。这个关怎样过呢？我们认为，必须在积极修建林区道路、开发边远林区、增产木材的同时，大量生产人造板，并积极提倡节约使用木材。也就是说，必须开源节流，同时并举。
    这里只谈人造板问题。人造板究竟在木材供应中占什么地位，能起多大作用？我们曾经研究分析了第一个五年计划期间木材消耗情况。在建筑、家具、包装等各项用材中，是否都一定需要用原木呢？不，其中有很大比例可以用人造板来代替。例如，建筑用材中有30％、包装家具用材中有60％、车船农具及机器用材有20％就可用人造板来代替。
    大量发展人造板的重要作用在于：第一、它能充分利用木材采伐及加工的剩余物，例如树枝、树皮、板边、刨花等。这种剩余物一般为原木生产量的30％。这些剩余物，过去都被丢弃在山上，对木材资源是个很大浪费，发展人造板就能把这些“废材废料”变成有用之材，作到合理利用森林资源。同时也可节约清理林场的投资，为采伐迹地更新创造有利条件。
    第二、人造板中的纤维板、刨花板所用的原料除去木材采伐及加工后剩余物外，还可以用一年、二年生的灌木、乔木及竹类作原料，也可以用草本纤维如棉秆皮、甘蔗渣、芦苇、茅草等多种植物作原料。特别值得提出的是用一、二年生的灌木幼树及竹类纤维制成的产品，其质量同样优良。这样，依靠幼林及目前经济价值不大的竹类纤维就能够大量代替木材，比快速树种来得还快。从而使我们摆脱依靠几十年生的大树解决木材供应问题的被动局面。
    第三、可以大大节约木材资源，缓和木材供应紧张局面。一立方公尺硬质纤维板可以等于五点七立方公尺的原木制成的板材使用。一立方公尺刨花板可以等于二立方公尺原木制成的板材使用。因而每生产一立方公尺的纤维板或刨花板即等于少采伐五点七或二立方公尺的原木。还应指出，发展人造板比增产原木能大大节约投资、钢铁和劳力。如生产二千二百万立方公尺原木，需要投资十六亿元，钢铁二十一万吨，劳力二十四万人；而生产代用二千二百万立方公尺原木的人造板，只要投资六亿元，钢铁十一万吨，劳力二十一万人。
    第四、可以节约使用部门的费用，提高劳动效率。据国外材料，使用纤维板、刨花板作家具可以提高劳动效率15％。据商业部材料，使用厚纸板作包装材料可以降低包装费用40％。建筑部门也反映，使用人造板后将大大降低成本。
    明年发展人造板，应以纤维板为主，适当的发展刨花板、厚纸板。这是因为生产纤维板所需辅助材料及机器设备容易解决；其他人造板则不同。如厚纸板所需机械较复杂，用钢材多；刨花板用胶多，而现在胶的生产又供不应求。同时，纤维板不仅原料比其他人造板丰富，且使用范围也比较广泛。
    鉴于以上情况，我们认为，为了扩大利用森林资源，节约森林资源，节约使用木材，保证建设需要，明年必须过人造板这一关，大搞能够充分利用采伐剩余物和加工剩余物制造人造板的木材加工工业，这是木材生产的正确发展方向。
