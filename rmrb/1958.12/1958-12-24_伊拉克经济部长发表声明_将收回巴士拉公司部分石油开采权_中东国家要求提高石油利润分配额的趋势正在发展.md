Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 23rd: Iraqi Economy Minister Kubba issued a statement on the evening of the 22nd, saying: After negotiations, the Basra Petroleum Company has agreed to relinquish its oil extraction rights in Iraqi territorial waters and return these rights to the Iraqi government.

The statement said, "Negotiations are continuing so that the oil companies will return to the Iraqi government those extraction areas where actual oil drilling work has not been carried out, because it will independently explore and drill for oil in these areas using the most appropriate methods."

The Basra Petroleum Company is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, controlled by British, American, French, and Dutch capital, and produced nine million tons of crude oil last year. Its concession areas include the entire southern region of Iraq, south of Baghdad. The extraction area returned by this oil company to the Iraqi government is in the Persian Gulf region. It is estimated that this region has very rich oil reserves.

This newspaper reports: The trend of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries demanding that Western oil companies increase their profit-sharing ratios has recently seen new developments. According to news from New York and London, the Saudi Arabian government, in negotiations with Indiana Mobil Oil Company of the United States regarding an oil concession area, has proposed a profit distribution method of 60% and 40% for oil production, refining, transportation, and sales. This greatly exceeds the current ratio of the "Aramco" and Saudi Arabian government, which split oil production profits equally at 50%.

For many years, Middle Eastern oil-producing countries and Western oil companies have been splitting oil production profits at a ratio of 50%. The production costs of oil companies are kept absolutely confidential, so the income of oil-producing countries is far below 50%. As for the profits from refining, transportation, and sales, they are entirely monopolized by oil monopoly capital groups. The governments of Middle Eastern oil-producing countries have long expressed dissatisfaction with this situation. In the past year or so, the Iranian government has successively signed contracts with Italian and American oil companies to split oil production profits at ratios of 75% and 25%, respectively. The governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have also successively signed contracts with Japanese oil companies to distribute profits from oil production, transportation, refining, and sales at ratios of 57% and 43%, and 56% and 44%. The signing of these contracts has caused shocks to American and British oil monopoly capital.

The American "New York Times" commented on Saudi Arabia's proposal to Indiana Mobil Oil Company for a new profit distribution method, writing that the demands made by Saudi Arabia indicate that "a wave of economic nationalism is once again exerting pressure on Western oil companies." Any new measures on the oil issue "will have a major political impact on the people of this region."

### 伊拉克经济部长发表声明  将收回巴士拉公司部分石油开采权  中东国家要求提高石油利润分配额的趋势正在发展

    伊拉克经济部长发表声明
    将收回巴士拉公司部分石油开采权
    中东国家要求提高石油利润分配额的趋势正在发展
    新华社巴格达23日电  伊拉克经济部长库巴22日晚间发表声明说：经过谈判，巴士拉石油公司同意放弃它在伊拉克领海内开采石油的权利，并且把这项权利交还伊拉克政府。
    声明说，“谈判还在继续进行中，以便使各石油公司把那些并没有实际进行过石油钻探工作的各开采区交还伊拉克政府，因为它将在这些地区内自行用最适当的办法开采和钻探石油。”
    巴士拉石油公司是英、美、法、荷资本控制的伊拉克石油公司的子公司，去年生产了九百万吨原油。它的租借地包括巴格达以南伊拉克的整个南部地区。这家石油公司交还给伊拉克政府的开采区是阿拉伯湾地区。据估计，这个地区石油蕴藏量非常丰富。
    本报讯  中东出产石油国家要求西方石油公司提高利润分配比额的趋势，最近有了新的发展。据纽约和伦敦消息，沙特阿拉伯政府在和美国印第安那美孚油公司关于一块石油开采地的谈判中，提出了按60％和40％对分石油生产、提炼、运输和销售等方面利润的分配办法。这就大大超过了目前“阿美石油公司”和沙特阿拉伯政府按50％平分石油生产利润的比额。
    中东出产石油国家和西方石油公司多年来都是按50％的比例对分石油生产利润的。石油公司生产成本是绝对保密的，因此出油国家所得远远低于50％。至于提炼、运输和销售方面的利润，则完全由石油垄断资本集团所独占。中东出产石油国家的政府久已对这种情况表示不满。一年多来，伊朗政府已先后和意大利的和美国的石油公司签订了按75％和25％对分石油生产利润的合同，科威特和沙特阿拉伯政府也先后和日本的石油公司签订了按57％与43％和56％与44％，分配石油生产、运输、提炼和销售等方面利润的合同。这些合同的签订都曾引起美英石油垄断资本的震动。
    美国“纽约时报”在评论沙特阿拉伯向印第安那美孚油公司提出新的分配利润办法一事写道：沙特阿拉伯所提出的要求表明，“经济民族主义的浪潮，正在重新向西方石油公司施加压力”。关于石油问题上任何新的措施，“都将对这个地区的人民产生重大的政治影响”。
