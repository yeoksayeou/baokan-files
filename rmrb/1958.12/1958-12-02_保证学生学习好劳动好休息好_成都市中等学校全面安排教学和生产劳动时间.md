This Dispatch from Chengdu, December 1st: Middle schools in Chengdu are taking various measures to comprehensively arrange teaching and production labor, ensuring that students have regular study, labor, and rest. A normal order has been established in the schools. Currently, the system of five days of study and one day of labor per week has been widely guaranteed in more than fifty middle schools and normal schools throughout the city; teaching time in more than twenty secondary vocational schools is also maintained at about 24 hours per week. Students also have two to three hours of self-study and one to two hours of physical exercise every day. Sundays are no longer occupied, and students enjoy rest and recreation.

Since the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor this spring, Chengdu middle schools have achieved great results. More than 190 factories and workshops have been established in middle schools throughout the city, and 37 farms and gardens have also been opened. As of mid-November, the total number of workdays completed by teachers and students in middle schools throughout the city reached 2.2 million. This has not only created a great deal of wealth for the country, but students have also learned production skills in labor, and their ideological awareness and learning quality have also greatly improved. Schools have also successively included productive labor in their teaching plans and established a system for teachers and students to participate in labor, carrying out teaching and production in an orderly manner. However, after schools undertook production tasks such as steelmaking, coking, machinery manufacturing, and transportation in September, the participation of students in labor greatly increased, and the connection between schools and social political movements and production struggles was further strengthened. However, some schools failed to seize this favorable opportunity to implement the Party's education policy and make proper arrangements for teaching and productive labor. Some school leaders were not clear enough about the principle that schools should focus on teaching and that production should be subordinate to teaching. When production tasks were tight, they relaxed their leadership over teaching; some schools regarded these labors as temporary tasks, without making comprehensive plans in advance, and lacked reasonable organization in labor, excessively occupying manpower, which affected teaching work.

In light of the above situation, the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of the Party Committee (General Branch, Branch) secretaries and principals of middle schools throughout the city in mid-November for serious study. The meeting held that the Party's education policy is to improve the quality of education. Education and productive labor must be combined more closely and perfectly, and teaching must never be relaxed while focusing on productive labor. Therefore, schools should make comprehensive arrangements for teaching, productive labor, scientific research, and other work. According to the different conditions of schools and majors, production labor outlines should be compiled to incorporate productive labor into the teaching plan; each school should also make a monthly labor plan so that students can participate in labor according to the plan; in addition, it is necessary to actively study and solve the problem of conducting teaching in labor. At the meeting, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee also requested that schools do their best to ensure that students sleep on time, have one day of rest every week, and have two to three hours of self-study time every day; teachers should also have sufficient time to prepare lessons and grade homework. In order to strengthen control over students' labor time, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee also decided that voluntary labor should be arranged uniformly by the Municipal Education Bureau and various district committees, and labor exceeding the plan should be approved by a certain leading organ.

After this meeting, Party organizations in various schools convened meetings one after another to check and study the arrangement of teaching and productive labor. The measures they took were roughly as follows: First, according to the needs of productive labor and the teaching situation, the school's labor system was re-examined. Ordinary middle schools continued to implement the system of five days of study, one day of labor, and one day of rest per week, while secondary vocational schools were arranged according to the "one, four, seven" (one month of vacation, four months of labor, and seven months of study), "one, three, eight," or "one, two, nine" system, and then the students were organized to concentrate on using labor time, taking turns to participate in labor by class. This facilitates both the arrangement of teaching and the students' learning of production technology, improving production efficiency. In the Fourth Middle School, although only a quarter of the high school students worked in the school-run factory in the two weeks after the arrangement, the production of various products such as lathes exceeded the total of the past six months. Second, for students engaged in concentrated labor, measures were taken to seize every minute and every second and seize every opportunity to arrange special timetables, send teachers to follow the class in labor, and use production gaps to conduct teaching, so that students can be taught wherever they go. The teaching content is also closely integrated with production practice. Many schools teach metalworking, physics, and industrial internships next to steelmaking furnaces and in machine factories. Secondary vocational schools such as textile industry schools and construction engineering schools also put professional courses in factories or construction sites for on-site teaching. Therefore, even students in various schools who are engaged in concentrated labor have two hours of study time every day, and there is also time in the morning and evening to review their lessons. Third, secondary vocational schools have also appropriately compressed and merged many courses according to the principle of strengthening basic technical courses and reducing general courses, and some outdated content has also been eliminated, so that students can learn more useful knowledge in a shorter period of time. After such arrangements, teaching, productive labor, and rest time in various schools have been reliably guaranteed. The Radio Industry School is one of the schools with a large production task. In the past, the school calculated that more than 1,000 of the school's 1,400 students needed to participate in labor for a long time. However, after taking the above measures, teachers and students vigorously carried out technical innovation, manufactured more than 20 transport vehicles and coal crushing and washing machines, greatly reducing the labor-intensive labor such as handling and coal crushing; implemented comprehensive militarization to better organize teachers and students; and sent some administrative and teaching leaders to grassroots production units to strengthen leadership. This school, which had once suspended classes due to the intensity of labor, quickly established a normal order. Only one-third of the students need to take turns to participate in labor, and they can also conduct more than four hours of study and self-study in labor every day. On Sundays, they can also fully rest.

Currently, middle schools in Chengdu are formulating production labor plans for teachers and students based on the teaching needs and production labor conditions of their schools, and are starting to compile production labor outlines on the basis of comprehensively considering the cultivation of students with certain production skills and theoretical knowledge, so that teaching and production labor can be more closely and perfectly combined.

    保证学生学习好劳动好休息好
    成都市中等学校全面安排教学和生产劳动时间
    本报成都1日电  成都市各中等学校采取多种措施，对教学和生产劳动进行全面安排，保证学生有规律地学习、劳动和休息。在学校里建立起了正常的秩序。现在，全市五十多所中学和师范，每周五天学习，一天劳动的制度已普遍得到保证；二十多所中等专业学校，教学时间也保持在每周二十四小时左右。学生们每天还有两、三小时自习和一、两小时体育锻炼时间。星期天也不再被占用，学生们就愉快地休息和娱乐。
    成都市中等学校在今年春天贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针以来，取得了很大成绩。全市中等学校建立的工厂、车间共有一百九十多个，还开辟了三十七个农场和园地。到11月中旬为止，全市中等学校师生所作的劳动日，共达二百二十万个。不仅为国家创造了许多财富，学生们在劳动中还学会了生产技能，思想觉悟和学习质量也大大提高。各校还先后把生产劳动列入了教学计划，定出师生参加劳动的制度，有秩序地进行教学和生产。但是，在9月份各学校担负起炼钢、炼焦、机械制造、运输等生产任务后，学生参加劳动大大增加，学校与社会政治运动和生产斗争的联系进一步加强，部分学校却没有抓住这个贯彻党的教育方针的有利时机，对教学和生产劳动进行妥善安排。有些学校领导人对学校以教学为主，生产服从教学的原则不够明确，生产任务紧张，就放松了对教学的领导；有些学校把这些劳动看作临时任务，事先不作全面计划，劳动中又缺乏合理组织，过多地占用人力，教学工作就因而受到影响。
    根据以上情况，中共成都市委宣传部在11月中旬召开了全市中等学校党委（总支、支部）书记和校长会议，进行了认真的研究。会议认为，党的教育方针是为了提高教育质量。必须把教育与生产劳动结合得更加紧密完善，决不能抓住生产劳动而放松了教学。因此，各学校应该对教学、生产劳动、科学研究和其他工作进行全面安排。根据不同学校和专业的情况，编制生产劳动大纲，把生产劳动纳入教学计划；每个月各学校还应作出全月劳动计划，以便学生按照计划参加劳动；此外，要积极研究解决在劳动中进行教学的问题。会上，市委宣传部并要求各校尽力保证学生按时睡眠，每星期有一天休息，每天有二至三小时自习时间；教师也要有充分的时间备课和批改作业。为了对学生劳动时间加强控制，市委宣传部还决定，义务劳动由市教育局和各个区委统一安排，超过计划的劳动要经过一定领导机关的批准。
    在这次会议后，各学校党组织都先后召开会议，对教学和生产劳动的安排问题作了检查和研究。他们采取的措施，大致有以下几项：一、根据生产劳动的需要和教学情况，重新研究了学校的劳动制度，普通中学继续按每周学习五天、劳动一天、休息一天的制度贯彻执行，中等专业学校则分别按“一、四、七”（每年放假一个月、劳动四个月、学习七个月）“一、三、八”或“一、二、九”制度安排，然后，把学生组织起来，集中使用劳动时间，分班轮流参加劳动。这样，既便于安排教学，也便于学生学习生产技术，提高生产效率。第四中学在安排后两周内，虽然只有四分之一的高中生在校办工厂劳动，生产的车床等各种产品却超过了过去半年多的总和。二、对集中劳动的学生，采取分秒必争，见缝插针办法，安排专门课表，派教师跟班劳动，利用生产空隙进行教学，作到学生到哪里，教学到哪里。在教学内容上，也紧密结合生产实际。许多学校在炼钢炉旁和机械厂里讲金工、物理和工业实习等课程。纺织工业学校、建筑工程学校等中等专业学校还把专业课下放到工厂或工地，进行现场教学。因此，即使各校进行集中劳动的学生，每天也有两小时学习时间，早晨和夜晚还另有时间复习功课。三、各中等专业学校还按照加强基础技术课、减少一般课程的原则，对许多课程作了适当的压缩、合并，一些内容陈旧过时的还加以取消，使学生在较短时间学到更多有用的知识。经过这样安排，各个学校的教学、生产劳动和休息时间，都有了可靠的保证。无线电工业学校是生产任务较大的学校之一。该校过去计算，全校一千四百多学生，需要一千多人长期参加劳动。但是，在采取上述措施后，师生们又大力开展技术革新，制造了二十多部运输车辆和碎煤、洗煤机，大大减少了耗费劳力最多的搬运、碎煤等劳动；实行了全面军事化，把师生更好地组织起来；并把一些行政和教学领导人派到基层生产单位，加强领导。这个曾经因劳动紧张而停过课的学校，就迅速建立了正常的秩序。全校只需三分之一的学生轮换参加劳动，每天还能在劳动中进行四小时以上的学习和自习。星期天，也可以充分地休息了。
    目前，成都市中等学校正在根据本校教学需要和生产劳动条件，制订师生生产劳动规划，并在通盘考虑培养学生具有一定生产技能和理论知识的基础上，着手编制生产劳动大纲，使教学和生产劳动更加紧密完善地结合起来。
