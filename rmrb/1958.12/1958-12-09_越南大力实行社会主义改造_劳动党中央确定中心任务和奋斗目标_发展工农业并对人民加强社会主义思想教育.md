Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 8th. The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnamese Labor Party, today published news of the 14th (enlarged) meeting of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

The news said that in November of this year, the 14th (enlarged) meeting of the Central Committee of the Labor Party heard Comrade Le Duan's report on the international situation, Comrade Nguyen Duy Trinh's report on the three-year plan for developing and transforming the national economy, and Comrade Truong Chinh's summary report on land reform work.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the central task of North Vietnam in the next few years is to implement socialist transformation. In this transformation, agricultural cooperativization must be the main link in developing agricultural production and promoting the entire socialist transformation cause.

Based on the great achievements in restoring the economy and developing cultural undertakings, the meeting decided that the main goals of the people of North Vietnam are: by the end of 1960: the total output of rice should reach at least 7.6 million tons per year, with an average of at least 500 kilograms of rice per person per year. In addition, efforts should be made to grow coarse grains and cash crops, and develop animal husbandry and fish farming to increase more non-staple foods. Strive to develop industries that produce means of production (including improved agricultural tools) and begin to build the iron and steel industry and the fuel industry. Build more power plants and build several new industrial zones, such as the Viet Tri Industrial Zone and the Thai Nguyen Industrial Zone. Increase the construction of water conservancy projects and transportation lines. Continue to develop the industry of producing consumer goods in order to gradually meet the growing needs of the people. By 1960, industry and handicrafts will be able to meet most of the domestic needs for major consumer goods such as cloth, sugar, household goods, and stationery. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, cultural literacy work must be carried out, and first-level general education must be popularized among the people, especially at the grassroots cadres and youth. Develop cultural, educational, medical, and health undertakings.

The Central Committee of the Labor Party also discussed the summary report on land reform work at this meeting. The meeting reaffirmed the achievements of the land reform work and the historic victory of the anti-feudal struggle in North Vietnam. The meeting conducted an in-depth review of the land reform work and organizational consolidation work. The meeting also pointed out that carrying out socialist ideological education within the party and among the people is a key task that determines the victory of other tasks. The entire party must attach the greatest importance to propaganda and education work, and must improve the quality of propaganda, education, literature and art work. (Attached picture)

    新华社河内8日电  越南劳动党机关报“人民报”今天发表了越南劳动党中央第十四次（扩大）会议的消息。
    消息说，今年11月，劳动党中央举行的第十四次（扩大）会议听取了黎笋同志关于国际形势的报告，阮维祯同志关于发展和改造国民经济三年计划的报告和长征同志关于土地改革工作的总结报告。
    会议一致认为，在今后几年内，越南北方的中心任务是实行社会主义改造。在这个改造中，必须以农业合作化作为发展农业生产和推动整个社会主义改造事业的主要环节。
    根据恢复经济、发展文化事业的巨大成就，会议决定越南北方人民主要的奋斗目标是：到1960年年底：稻谷总产量最少要达到年产七百六十万吨，按人口计算平均每人每年最少要有五百公斤稻谷。此外，还要努力种植杂粮、经济作物，发展畜牧业和养鱼业，以增加更多的副食品。努力发展生产生产资料的工业（包括改良农具），开始建设钢铁工业、燃料工业。增建一些发电厂，建设几个新的工业区，如越池工业区、太原工业区等。增建水利工程和交通运输线。继续发展生产消费品的工业，以便逐步满足人民日益增加的需要。到1960年，工业和手工业将能满足国内对主要消费品如布、糖、家庭用品、文具等的大部分需要。在肃清文盲的基础上，必须开展文化补习工作，开始在人民中，首先是在基层干部和青年中，普及第一级普通教育。发展文化、教育、医务、卫生等事业。
    劳动党中央这次会议还讨论了土地改革工作总结报告。会议再次肯定了土地改革工作的成绩和越南北方的反封建斗争的具有历史性的胜利。会议对土地改革工作和整顿组织工作进行了深刻的检查。会议还指出，在党内和在人民中进行社会主义思想教育，是决定其它各项工作取得胜利的一项关键性的工作，全党对宣传、教育工作必须加以最大的重视，必须提高宣传、教育、文学和艺术工作的质量。（附图片）
