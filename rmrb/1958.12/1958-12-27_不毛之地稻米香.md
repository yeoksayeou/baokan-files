Fragrant Rice from Barren Land
By Our Correspondent Xian Zhaorui

This year, the Soil Improvement Experimental Station of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region achieved a bumper harvest of rice for the first time on a piece of severely saline-alkali "Bai Jiang Tu" (white hardened soil) in Daxingdun, Pingluo County. In the 0.73 mu of experimental Bai Jiang Tu field, the highest yielding green manure test area, a 45-square-meter paddy field, yielded a total of 36.1 jin of rice, equivalent to a yield of 455.6 jin per mu. This has ended the history of Bai Jiang Tu being unusable and provided valuable data for soil science research.

It is truly not an easy task to grow rice on Bai Jiang Tu. This type of soil is a strongly alkaline saline-alkali soil with a hard texture and extremely poor water permeability and aeration. When dry, it is as hard as iron and cannot be plowed; when wet, it becomes a muddy mess, making it impossible for livestock and machinery to work the land. Areas with this type of soil are barren, hence, both Chinese and foreign experts call it "barren land," and local farmers call it "smooth cement road."

In the past, not only had China not found a way to improve this type of soil, but also no successful improvement data could be found in soil science literature. At that time, some people with serious conservative ideas even believed that improving this type of soil was not a matter for our generation, but a "task for the next generation." However, the harm of Bai Jiang Tu to agricultural production and construction is very serious. Taking Ningxia as an example, 650,000 mu of flat land on the Yellow River Plain has been barren for a long time due to the harm of Bai Jiang Tu; Bai Jiang Tu is like a rotten sore, corroding fertile farmland. The hardworking farmers of all ethnic groups spend a lot of effort every year to carry out small pieces of Bai Jiang Tu interspersed in the good fields and replace them with good soil...

In the spring, when the Chinese people embarked on the Great Leap Forward, the staff of the Soil Improvement Experimental Station also felt stirred up: "Everyone is making a Great Leap Forward, can we, who are engaged in soil work, also make a leap forward?..." They thought: Hasn't the Party repeatedly taught us that we should dare to think what our predecessors didn't dare to think, and create what doesn't exist in the world? Finally, they liberated their minds, broke with conventions, and one night in early spring, under the initiative of technician Huang Zhenhua, jointly studied and formulated a bold plan to try to grow rice on Bai Jiang Tu. At that time, some people expressed indifference, believing that trying to grow rice on Bai Jiang Tu was not that simple and lacked sufficient theoretical basis. However, the relevant leading departments gave firm support and encouragement to their bold attempt. The responsible comrades of the Ningxia Agricultural Science Research Institute also specially sent vehicles to help them transport fertilizer and materials. The responsible comrades of the Soil Improvement Experimental Station also invited several experienced farmers from nearby agricultural cooperatives to provide technical guidance, which further increased the confidence in the experiment.

Plowing began, but the hard soil could not be dug with iron shovels. Some people said: This soil is so hard, we might as well not dig it; others said: A shallow plowing would be enough. After discussing with the experienced farmers, they told them: To succeed in the experiment, the first step is to plow the land deeply. Therefore, they jointly came up with a way to plow the land—first use a pickaxe to dig small holes in the hard ground, and then lift the "lids." After several days of hard work, they finally plowed a selected piece of severely saline-alkali Bai Jiang Tu, reaching a depth of six to seven inches.

Before sowing, they consulted a lot of data and found that using gypsum could destroy the original soil structure. They personally went to Helan Mountain to collect 800 jin of gypsum and applied it to the land; based on the characteristics of high soil alkalinity and poor fertility, they also applied 4,000 jin of farmyard manure, 1,000 jin of green manure, and 50 jin of phosphate fertilizer as base fertilizer. At the same time, considering the high alkalinity and the possibility of seedling death, they sowed 40 jin per mu, 20% more than the local general paddy fields.

A few days after sowing, dense shoots appeared in the paddy field, and everyone was very happy. After hearing about it, the members of the nearby agricultural cooperative also came to see the "rare thing." However, people with conservative ideas came out again to make sarcastic remarks: "It's sprouting, but I'm afraid it will be difficult to pass the one-month mark!" The comrades of the Soil Improvement Experimental Station also felt that this was indeed a critical juncture related to the fate of the rice. Whenever they had free time, they would flip through books, check data, and study the properties of Bai Jiang Tu and the experiences and lessons of local rice planting over the years; at the same time, they carefully observed the growth of the rice, measured the changes in soil pH and water temperature regardless of wind and rain, recorded various valuable data, and strengthened field management. According to local customs, within seven to thirteen days after the rice seedlings emerged, the water should be drained for a few days to allow the rice roots to take firm root in the soil before irrigating again. But they broke this habit, and after discussing with the members of the cooperative, adopted the method of "live water irrigation" (i.e., irrigating while draining water), which not only avoided floating seedlings, but also prevented the rise of alkaline water, greatly reducing the "sodium ions" in the Bai Jiang Tu that are most harmful to crops. Yang Baoyu, an experienced farmer, was moved by the comrades' daring and hard-working style and presented a valuable experience he had accumulated over the years. This experience is: during the seedling growth period, a thick layer of muddy soil should be silted up in the field, so that the rice roots can be firmly rooted in the muddy soil, and the activity of the root system can develop vigorously with the help of organic fertilizer in the muddy soil, ensuring the normal growth of seedlings during water drainage. The comrades immediately adopted this valuable suggestion and dug a muddy water ditch, silting up two or three inches of muddy soil.

Timely topdressing with various fertilizers containing different ingredients according to the growth and development process of the crops is another key to ensuring the normal development of rice. However, on this issue, the general topdressing habit of local rice for many years is to regularly topdress or topdress less at the seedling emergence, jointing, and heading stages. They broke this habit and adopted the method of continuous topdressing and more topdressing. From the time the rice seedlings grew three leaves to the time of heading and grain filling, they respectively topdressed 10 jin of blood meal, 1,000 jin of pig manure, 35 jin of superphosphate (three times), 300 jin of liquid fertilizer, and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate by topdressing, spraying, and watering, so that the crops received extremely rich nutrients at each stage and safely passed the "one-month mark."

When the rice began to bear ears, technician Huang Zhenhua found that some rice seedlings had withered leaf tips, and he was very anxious. On the one hand, he mobilized everyone to topdress with superphosphate again; on the other hand, he took samples and rushed more than 100 li to the Yinchuan Agricultural Technology Extension Station to study prevention and control methods. They found that the reason for the withered leaf tips was the lack of trace elements, so they sprayed copper sulfate and boric acid once, breaking through the last hurdle for the normal development and growth of rice and ensuring a bumper harvest. Now, all the comrades of the Soil Improvement Experimental Station of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are actively preparing, planning to cultivate high-yielding rice on Bai Jiang Tu with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu next year.

    不毛之地稻米香
    本报记者  咸兆瑞
    今年，宁夏回族自治区土壤改良试验站在平罗县大兴墩的一块恶性白礓土上，第一次种植水稻获得丰收。七分三厘白礓土试验田中，最高的压青试验区四十五平方公尺稻田，共收稻子三十六点一斤，折合亩产四百五十五点六斤。从此，结束了白礓土不能开发利用的历史，给土壤科学研究工作提供了宝贵资料。
    要让白礓土上长出水稻来，真是一件不容易的事。这种土壤是一种含有强烈碱性的碱化土壤，质地坚硬，透水通气极差，干时坚硬如铁，翻犁不动；遇水则泥泞一团，牲畜、机具无法下地。凡是有这种土壤的地区，都是寸草不生，因此，中外专家都称它为“不毛之地”，当地农民叫它“光板洋灰马路”。
    过去，不但在我国没有研究出改良这种土壤的办法，就是在土壤学文献上也查不出一个改良成功的资料来。当时，有些保守思想严重的人，甚至认为改良这种土壤不是我们这一代考虑的问题，而是“下一代的任务”。但是，白礓土对农业生产建设的危害是很严重的。就拿宁夏来说，地处黄河平原上的六十五万亩平展展的土地，由于白礓土的危害而长久地荒芜着；白礓土更是像一块块腐烂了的浓疮一样，腐蚀着肥沃的良田，勤劳的各族农民，每年要花费许多精力把插花在好田里的一小块一小块的白礓土背出去，换上好土……。
    春天，当我国人民跨上了跃进马飞速前进的时候，土壤改良试验站的工作人员的心里也翻腾起来：“人人都在大跃进，我们这些搞土壤工作的人能不能跃进？……”他们想：党不是一再教导我们，前人不敢想的我们要敢想，世界上没有的我们要创造吗？终于解放了思想，打破了清规戒律，在初春的一个夜晚，由技术员黄震华同志倡议共同研究订出了在白礓土上试种水稻的大胆的计划。当时，有些人表示很冷淡，认为在白礓土上试种水稻不是那么简单的事，没有充分的理论根据。但是，有关领导部门对他们这种大胆的尝试，给予坚决支持和鼓励。宁夏农业科学研究所的负责同志还专门派去车辆，帮助他们运肥运料。土壤改良试验站的负责同志又从附近农业社请来了几个老农做技术指导，进一步提高了试验的信心。
    翻地开始了，坚硬的土地铁锹挖它不动。有些人就说：这么硬的土地，挖不动干脆算了；有的说：浅翻一下也就可以了。经过和老农研究，老农告诉他们：要想试验成功，头一步就得把地深翻好。因此，共同想出翻地的办法——先用洋镐在坚硬的地面上刨开一个个小洞，再揭“盖子”。费了好几天功夫，终于把选好的一块恶性白礓土地翻好，深度达六、七寸。
    播种前，他们查看了许多资料，发现使用石膏可以破坏原来的土壤结构。便亲自到贺兰山采回石膏八百斤，施到地里；又根据土壤碱性大、肥力差等特点，施了四千斤厩肥、一千斤绿肥和五十斤磷肥做基肥。同时，还考虑到碱性大、容易死苗的情况，每亩下种量四十斤，比当地一般稻田多20％。
    下种以后不几天，稻田里生出了密密麻麻的一片嫩芽，大家万分高兴。附近农业社的社员们听到后，也跑来看“稀罕”。但是，有保守思想的人又出来说风凉话了：“出苗是出苗了，恐怕难过满月关啊！”土壤改良试验站的同志们也觉得这确是关系水稻命运死活的一个严重关头。一有空，他们就翻书籍、查资料，研究白礓土壤的性能和当地历年来播种水稻的经验教训；同时，还详细地观察着水稻的生长情况，不避风雨地测量着土壤酸碱度变化情况和水温情况，记载着各种宝贵资料，并加强了田间管理。按照当地的习惯，在水稻出苗后的七天到十三天内就要退水晒秧几天，使稻根在泥土上扎实以后再灌水。但是他们打破了这种习惯，和社员们研究，采取了“活水灌溉”（即边退水边灌溉）的办法，既避免了漂秧，又防止了碱水上升，大大减少了白礓土中对作物危害最大的“钠离子”。富有种稻经验的老农杨保玉同志被同志们敢想敢干的风格和苦干的精神所感动，把他多年来积累的一条宝贵的经验献出来了。这条经验是：在水稻幼苗生长期间，在田里淤积一层厚厚的浑泥，这样，既可使稻根牢固地扎在浑泥里，又可使根系的活动借着浑泥里的有机肥料而发育茁壮，保证在退水时幼苗的正常生长。同志们马上采纳了这一宝贵意见，开挖了一道浑水沟，淤积了二、三寸浑泥。
    根据作物的生长情况和发育过程，及时追施含有不同成分的各种肥料，是保证水稻正常发育的另一个关键。但是，在这个问题上，当地一般水稻多年来的追肥习惯是按照出苗、拔节、抽穗等阶段定期追肥或少追肥。他们打破了这种习惯，采取了不断追肥、多追肥的办法。从稻苗长出三个叶子开始，到抽穗灌浆时止，根据土质改变情况和稻草发育情况，用追肥、喷施、顺水施等方法分别追了十斤血粉、一千斤猪粪、三十五斤过磷酸钙（三次）、三百斤液肥和十斤硫酸錏，使作物在各个阶段得到了极为丰富的养料，安全地渡过了“满月关”。
    水稻开始孕穗了，技术员黄震华发现有些稻苗的叶尖有枯萎现象，心里非常着急。他一面发动大家又追了一次过磷酸钙；一面带上样品赶了一百多里路到银川农业技术推广站，研究防治的办法。研究出叶尖枯萎的原因是缺少微量元素，就喷射了一次硫酸铜和硼酸，突破了水稻正常发育生长的最后一关，保证了丰收。现在，宁夏回族自治区土壤改良试验站的全体同志，正在积极准备，计划明年培植亩产二千斤的白礓土高额丰产水稻。
