    "The Land of Abundance North of the Border" Rejuvenates
    Ningxia's Experience in Preventing and Treating Soil Salinization in the Yellow River Irrigated Area
    By our correspondent in Yinchuan

    The Ningxia Plain in the Yellow River irrigated area of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has a history of irrigation for over two thousand years. The Tanglai, Hanyan, Qinhang and other large canals were all ancient canals built during the Han and Tang dynasties. Before liberation, due to the lack of drainage facilities, the low-lying areas of the plain formed the famous Seventy-Two Connected Lakes. In this Yellow River Plain of eight hundred *li*, known as the "Land of Abundance North of the Border," the Hui and Han farmers sang songs of grief and indignation: "Ningxia Plain, watering the fields, planting and harvesting every year, but having nothing to eat, suffering endlessly!" At that time, the lake water not only occupied large tracts of farmland, but also raised the groundwater level due to the continuous lakes and swamps, increasing the degree of soil alkalization year by year. According to scientific measurements, approximately 2.9 billion tons of Yellow River water were introduced annually, bringing in about 1.3 million tons of salt, of which about 1 million tons remained in the ground after partial drainage. Soil salinization became an increasingly serious obstacle to the development of agricultural production.

    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government first mobilized the masses to renovate the existing canals, giving the water conservancy projects a new look. Then, they began to study the prevention and treatment of salinization and soil improvement. Starting in 1952, the construction of a drainage system began, and at present, a complete drainage network has been basically formed, creating good conditions for eliminating soil salinization. Now, the average yield of wheat per *mu* on the plain has increased from about 150 *jin* before liberation to 510 *jin*. The Ningxia Plain has become a truly prosperous place.

    The experiences of this irrigated area in preventing and treating soil salinization are as follows:

    1. Water Conservancy Improvement: Soil salinization is mainly caused by irrigation, so improvement from the water conservancy aspect is the most fundamental method. According to experiments, if comprehensive measures are taken in terms of water conservancy, the soil salinity can be reduced from 5% to below 3%. Specific measures are: (1) Ditch Drainage: The construction of a complete drainage system can not only effectively lower the groundwater level and improve saline-alkali soil, but also drain the lake fields, turning lakes and swamps into fertile fields. (2) Muddy Water Silting: The sediment content of the Yellow River during the flood season is 6% to 14%, containing rich nutrients. Irrigation during the flood season, after the sediment settles, the clear water is discharged, which has a great effect on improving soil salinization. (3) Summer Soaking and Winter Irrigation: Irrigation in the hot summer and early winter can flush away surface salt. (4) Small Ridges and Shallow Irrigation: Farmers in the irrigated area have traditionally had the habit of "flooding irrigation," which wastes water and raises the ground water level. According to experiments, the yield can be increased by about 10% after implementing small ridges and shallow irrigation. (5) Canal Renovation: Old canals have large seepage, eroding nearby farmland, and therefore need to be silted and embankments reinforced.

    2. Cultivation Improvement: The irrigated area has sparse rainfall (annual rainfall of 250 mm) and a dry, windy climate. In order to prevent evaporation and lower the groundwater level, improvements in cultivation techniques are also important for overcoming salinization. Specific measures are: (1) Early Spring Harrowing: This can loosen the soil and reduce evaporation. Generally, it is required to harrow twice and cultivate once in the spring. (2) Land Leveling: Uneven ground surface not only wastes water, but also easily forms "salt spots." (3) Increased Application of Organic Fertilizer: This can enhance the plant's salt resistance and improve soil structure. According to experiments, on saline soil where seedlings cannot be caught, applying 40 *jin* of pig manure per *mu* can result in a yield of 450 *jin* per *mu* after three years. (4) Sand Covering and Alkali Suppression: The masses say, "Sand covering alkali is better than a gold board." This is because fine sand spread on saline soil can improve the soil and suppress alkali. (5) Summer and Autumn Turning and Sunning: The weather is hot in the summer, and turning and sunning more can cut off soil capillaries and prevent salt from rising. According to experiments, the salt content of autumn-turned stubble fields can be reduced by about 50%. (6) Dense Planting and Coverage: Cross-dense planting of crops such as wheat has the advantages of reducing evaporation, preventing salt return, and avoiding seedling shortages. (7) Dry Farming: In the Pingluo and Huinong areas north of Yinchuan, the method of "dry farming" has been promoted in accordance with local conditions, reducing salt content by 0.137% compared to winter irrigation. (8) Loosening Soil After Rain: After rain, the soil hardens, and salt is most likely to rise. It is necessary to loosen the soil, weed, and harrow the seedlings in a timely manner.

    3. Crop Improvement: In addition to planting salt-tolerant crops, soil should also be improved through crop selection in areas of soil salinization. The measures are: (1) Rice Planting to Wash Away Salt: Rice has strong salt tolerance. Planting rice in the first year not only provides a harvest, but also washes away salt and improves the soil due to the large amount of irrigation. (2) Planting Green Manure: Green manure is mostly leguminous crops, with rhizobia that can improve fertility and improve soil structure. (3) Planting Salt-Tolerant Crops: Crops such as barnyard grass, millet, and foxtail millet have strong salt tolerance and yield very high in areas with heavy saline-alkali. (4) Crop Rotation: Planting rice for too long can easily cause groundwater and salt to rise. Gradually transitioning paddy fields to dry land is an effective way to improve the soil. (5) Planting Trees for Drainage: According to scientific research, each ten-year-old poplar tree can drain 82 tons of water per year; in areas where willow trees are planted, the amount of water evaporation is 22 times greater than the natural evaporation in similar areas without trees. Therefore, the significance of planting trees and afforestation in irrigated areas is even greater.

    “塞上江南”又回春
    宁夏引黄灌区防治土壤盐渍化的经验
    本报驻银川记者
    宁夏回族自治区引黄灌溉区的宁夏平原，灌溉历史已有两千多年了。唐徕、汉延、秦汉等几条大型渠道，都是汉、唐时修建的古老渠道。在解放前，由于没有排水设施，平原上低洼地形成著名的七十二连湖，在这个素有“塞上江南”之称的八百里的黄河平原上，回汉族农民们却悲愤地唱着“宁夏川，水浇田，年种年收无吃穿，苦连天！”的歌谣。那时湖水不仅侵占了大片耕地，湖沼连绵提高了地下水位，土壤碱化程度逐年增加。据科学测量：每年引入黄河水约为二十九亿吨，带入盐分约一百三十万吨，除排泄一部分外，还有约一百万吨留在地里。土壤盐渍化愈来愈严重，成为发展农业生产的一个重大障碍。
    解放以后，党和人民政府首先发动群众整修旧有的渠道，使水利工程面目一新。接着便着手研究防治盐渍化和改良土壤的工作。从1952年起，即开始兴建排水系统，到目前一个完整的排水网已基本形成，这给消灭土壤盐渍化创造了良好的条件。现在平原上小麦平均亩产已由解放前一百五十斤左右，提高到五百一十斤。宁夏平原已经成为一个真正富饶的地方了。
    这个灌区防治土壤盐渍化的经验有以下几项：
    一、水利改良方面：  土壤盐渍化主要是由灌溉引起的，因此从水利方面改良是最根本的办法。据试验，如果从水利方面采取全面措施后，即可使土壤盐分由5％降到3％以下。具体措施是：（1）开沟排水：兴修完整的排水体系，不但可以有效地降低地下水位，改良盐渍化土壤，同时还可以涸出湖田，使湖沼变为良田。（2）浑水淤田：黄河在洪水期的含沙量为6％到14％，含有丰富的肥分。洪水时期进行灌溉，泥沙澄淀后将清水排出，对改良土壤盐渍化有很大作用。（3）伏泡冬灌：在伏天和冬初进行灌溉，可以冲洗地面盐分。（4）小畦浅灌：灌区农民历来有“大水漫灌”的习惯，既浪费水又提高地面水位。据试验实行小畦浅灌后，产量可提高10％左右。（5）整修渠道：旧有渠道渗漏很大，浸蚀着附近的农田，因而需要进行流淤固堤。
    二、耕作改良方面：灌区雨量稀少（年雨量二百五十公厘）、气候干燥多风，为防止蒸发，降低地下水位，在耕作技术上的改良对于克服盐渍化也很重要。具体措施是：（1）早春耙耘：可以疏松土壤，减少蒸发。一般要求春天耙两遍、耘一遍。（2）平整土地：地面高低不平，不仅浪费水量，而且容易形成“盐斑”。（3）增施有机肥料：可以增强植物抗盐能力，改善土壤结构。据试验在捉不住苗的盐土上，每亩施用猪肥四十斤，三年后每亩产量能达四百五十斤。（4）铺沙盖碱：群众说“沙盖碱，赛金板”。这是由于细沙铺在盐土上，可以起改良土壤和压碱作用。（5）伏秋翻晒：伏天气候炎热，多翻多晒可以切断土壤毛细管，防止盐分上升。据试验：秋翻板茬田含盐量可降低50％左右。（6）密植复盖：小麦等作物采用交叉密植，好处：可以减少蒸发，防止反盐，避免缺苗。（7）打干田：银川以北平罗、惠农一带，因地制宜地推行了“打干田”的办法，比冬灌田减少盐分0.137％。（8）雨后松土：雨后土壤板结，盐分最容易上升，必须及时松土、锄草、耙苗。
    三、作物改良方面：土壤盐渍化地区除应种植耐盐作物外，还应通过作物改良土壤。措施是：（1）种稻洗盐：水稻耐盐性强，第一年种稻不仅可有收获，且因灌水多能冲洗盐分，改良土壤。（2）种植绿肥：绿肥多系豆科作物，有根瘤菌可以提高肥力，改善土壤结构。（3）种植抗盐作物：稗子、糜、谷等作物抗盐性能很强，种植在盐碱较重的地区，产量很高。（4）水旱轮作：种稻过久，容易引起地下水和盐分上升。如将水田逐渐过渡到旱田，是改良土壤的有效办法。（5）植树排水：据科学研究，每棵十年生的杨树，每年可排水分八十二吨；在种植柳树的地区水分蒸发量要比不种树的同样的地区自然蒸发量大二十二倍。因此，在灌区植树造林的意义就更为重大。
