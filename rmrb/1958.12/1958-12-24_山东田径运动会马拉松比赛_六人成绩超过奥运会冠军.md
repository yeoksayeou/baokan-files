Shandong Track and Field Meet Marathon
    Six Runners Exceed Olympic Champion's Time

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd – Another group of marathon runners in our country have reached world-class levels. At the Shandong Provincial Winter Track and Field Meet held in Jinan on the 21st, the results of six marathon runners exceeded the record of two hours and twenty-five minutes set by the marathon champion of the 16th Olympic Games, the French athlete Mimoun. The times of the top three even broke the highest record in the history of the Olympic marathon race – two hours, twenty-three minutes and three point two seconds.

    The first place winner was Li Dunyong from Qingdao, who set a new national record of two hours, nineteen minutes and fifty-five point six seconds. Li Dunyong participated in the 1958 National Marathon Championships in Beijing on November 3rd, and finished twenty-third with a time of two hours, thirty-four minutes and fourteen seconds. However, in less than fifty days, his result surpassed that of the national champion of that championship, Zheng Zhaoxin from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (time of two hours, twenty-one minutes and twenty-nine seconds).

    山东田径运动会马拉松比赛
    六人成绩超过奥运会冠军
    新华社济南23日电  我国又有一批马拉松赛跑选手的成绩达到了世界水平。21日在济南举行山东省冬季田径运动会时，有六名马拉松选手的成绩都超过了第十六届奥林匹克运动会马拉松冠军、法国选手米蒙创造的二时二十五分的纪录。其中前三名的成绩还打破了历届奥林匹克运动会马拉松赛跑的最高纪录——二时二十三分三秒二。
    获得第一名的是青岛市选手李敦涌，他创造了二时十九分五十五秒六的全国最高成绩。李敦涌今年11月3日在北京参加1958年全国马拉松锦标赛时，获得第二十三名，当时的成绩是二时三十四分十四秒。可是，过了还不到五十天，他的成绩就超过了那次锦标赛的全国冠军、内蒙古自治区的郑昭信（成绩二时二十一分二十九秒）。
    在这次山东省冬季田径运动会上，获得马拉松比赛第二名和第三名的是山东体育学院的梁在銮和宋义臣，他们的成绩分别是二时二十一分五十八秒四和二时二十三分零秒六。
