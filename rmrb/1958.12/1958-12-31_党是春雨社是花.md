The Party is the spring rain, the commune is the flower,
Flowers bloom for miles, scenting every home,
Five-in-one, twisting steel ropes,
United as one, the strength is immense.
The people's commune is a flower,
Loved by men, women, old and young,
With food, clothing, housing and transport guaranteed,
The commune is the home of its members.
The commune's flower is planted by the people,
Blooming in myriad colors everywhere,
Life gets better and better,
Communist happiness arrives.

    党是春雨社是花
  党是春雨社是花，
  花开十里香万家，
  五位一体拧钢绳，
  万众一心力量大。
  人民公社一枝花，
  男女老少都爱它，
  衣食住行有保障，
  公社就是社员家。
  公社之花人民栽，
  万紫千红处处开，
  日子越过越美好，
  共产主义幸福来。
