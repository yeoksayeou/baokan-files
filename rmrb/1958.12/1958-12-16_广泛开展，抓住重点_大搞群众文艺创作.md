    Widely Launch, Grasp Key Points
    Vigorously Promote Mass Literary and Artistic Creation
    Huangpu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Qiande, Lu Zhiqian
    In order to strive for a great harvest of literary and artistic works for the National Day celebration next year, under the instruction of the Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, we first established a key literary and artistic creation headquarters, led by the First Secretary of the District Committee, with the Propaganda Department leaders personally responsible for the overall work. We made full use of various district-wide cadre meetings to repeatedly conduct ideological mobilization, pointing out the significant political importance of key literary and artistic creation work, requiring Party organizations at all levels to put politics in command, mobilize the entire Party, pay attention to leadership, and fully mobilize the masses to ensure that key literary and artistic creation is based on the mass creation movement. In this way, after repeated emphasis, more than 80 grassroots Party committees, general branches, and directly subordinate branches in our district have begun to place the "key literary and artistic creation" work in its proper important position.
    Secondly, we constantly conducted ideological mobilization in response to the specific ideological situation of the cadres. Frankly speaking, regarding "literary and artistic creation," we ourselves had varying degrees of ideological constraints. The main reason was a lack of understanding of literary and artistic creation, considering it a more specialized issue, especially lacking sufficient confidence in the requirement to create a certain number of excellent works with a certain political ideology and artistic level. However, facts powerfully educated us that even large-scale literary and artistic works were not beyond the concern of our workers and masses. For example, the Oil and Grain General Branch in our district had a moving story of residents in the alleyways rescuing grain during a tidal bore. The workers and masses were very interested in this and had written news reports and poems for newspapers and periodicals, but they simply did not dare to use large-scale literary and artistic forms to express it, believing it was beyond their capabilities. Later, after our specific mobilization, we broke through ideological constraints and increased their writing confidence. As a result, several grain store workers who had never written screenplays before confidently began writing. Using several evenings of their spare time, a draft of a screenplay entitled "Night Tide on the Huangpu River" was unexpectedly and rapidly completed.
    We used this type of specific example as material for liberating thought. It seems that this is a relatively effective method. After this kind of exchange and introduction, it often prompted some people who were still undecided about key literary and artistic creation to quickly make up their minds to write.
    In addition, on the basis of full mobilization, the "command" organizations at all levels also conducted thorough and meticulous work to discover and organize authors through individual contact. In the 65 key literary and artistic creations currently underway, a large proportion of them were first discovered by us through the rectification campaign and the work reports of various grassroots organizations to the District Committee. Then, we contacted the relevant cadres and masses with a specific goal, mobilizing and organizing them to write. The advantage of this individual contact is that it not only allows us to conduct ideological mobilization work more meticulously and deeply, but also allows us to specifically study and solve some of the difficulties and problems encountered in writing with the authors. Generally speaking, as long as we find the right themes, the writing enthusiasm shown by the masses through such "individual contact" often exceeds our estimates.
    In organizing and discovering key literary and artistic creations, we also regarded mobilizing cadres with longer revolutionary experiences to participate in writing as an important aspect of our work. According to preliminary understanding, there are currently one or two hundred such cadres in our district. Most of them participated in the struggles of various revolutionary periods in history, and many of their struggle experiences should be rich creative themes reflecting our great era. One general branch secretary has now decided to complete a revolutionary struggle novel that he had started three or four years ago. However, these cadres mostly hold certain leadership positions. Therefore, in order to help them solve some writing time issues and cultural level limitations, we plan to organize a writing team with a certain cultural level, writing ability, and high political quality to cooperate with them in writing.
    Through this period of work, a relatively deep experience we have gained is that whether in organizational mobilization or specific writing, we must implement the working method of combining leadership with the masses. The facts show that after the establishment of the Key Literary and Artistic Creation Headquarters in our district, the First Secretary took command, the Propaganda Department leaders personally took action, and organizations at all levels were able to establish themselves relatively quickly, and the number of key literary and artistic creations quickly increased from the original 25 to 65. At the same time, because the leadership attaches importance to it, we can promptly obtain strong support in various measures.
    In general, the key literary and artistic creation work in our district is still underway. We plan to concentrate more energy on regular writing tutoring activities in various forms after the establishment and improvement of organizations at all levels, the mobilization of the masses, and a considerable number of key creations. The key literary and artistic creation work in our district has basically just begun. It is obvious that a greater effort by the entire Party is needed to truly grasp it deeply and thoroughly, so as to complete the glorious and arduous creation task assigned by the Party with quality and quantity.

### 广泛开展，抓住重点  大搞群众文艺创作

    广泛开展，抓住重点
    大搞群众文艺创作
    中共上海市黄浦区委会  王乾德  陆峙强
    为了争取明年纪念国庆的文艺大丰收，我们在市委宣传部指示下，首先成立了重点文艺创作指挥部，由区委第一书记挂帅，宣传部领导动手负责全面工作的进行，充分利用了各种全区性的干部会议，反复务虚，指出重点文艺创作工作的重大政治意义，要求各级党的组织必须政治挂帅，全党动手，领导重视，全面发动群众，使重点文艺创作在群众性创作运动基础上获得保证。这样，经过反复强调，我们全区八十多个基层党委、总支、和直属支部已经开始把“重点文艺创作”这项工作，放到应有的重要位置上来了。
    其次，我们针对干部中的具体思想情况不断进行务虚。实在讲，对于“文艺创作”，从我们自己开始，都有不同程度的思想束缚，主要是平时对文艺创作缺乏了解，认为这是比较专门性的问题，特别对于要求创作一定数量的有一定政治思想、艺术水平的优秀作品，缺乏足够信心。但是事实有力地教育我们，即使是大型的文艺作品，我们职工群众也不是不可过问的，如我区油粮总支有一个江潮倒灌时里弄居民抢救粮食的动人故事，职工群众对此很有兴趣，曾向报刊写了通讯、诗歌，但只是不敢去用大型的文艺形式表现出来，认为这是力所不及的。后来经过我们具体地动员，打破了思想束缚，提高了他们的写作自信，于是几个从来没有写过电影剧本的粮店职工，就信心百倍地动笔写了，结果利用几个晚上的业余时间，一部题名为：“浦江夜潮”的电影剧本初稿，就意外迅速地完成了。
    我们利用这类具体事例，作为解放思想的材料，看来这是一个比较有效的办法，经过这种交流、介绍，往往促使有些在重点文艺创作上还打不定主意的人很快下了写作决心。
    此外在全面发动的基础上，各级“指挥”组织还深入细致地通过个别联系的方式发掘和组织作者。我们在现有六十五个重点文艺创作中，有很大部分都是我们首先通过整风工作和各基层组织给区委的工作汇报来发现题材，然后有目标地与有关的干部、群众联系，动员、组织他们来执笔创作的。这种个别联系的好处是：不但可以把思想务虚工作做得更细致、深入，而且还可以和作者具体研究解决一些写作所碰到的困难和问题。一般地讲，只要我们题材找准，通过这样的“个别联系”，群众表现出来的写作劲头往往是超过我们估计的。
    在组织、挖掘重点文艺创作中，我们还把发动有较长革命经历的干部来参加写作，列为我们工作的一个重要方面。经初步了解，我区现有这样的干部一、二百人，他们大都参加过历史上各个革命时期的斗争，他们当中的许多斗争经历，应该是很丰富的反映我们这个伟大时代的创作题材。有一位总支书记这次已经决心把三、四年前已经着手的革命斗争小说在最近续写完毕；但是这些干部大都负责一定的领导工作，因此为了协助他们解决一些写作时间问题和文化水平限制问题，我们打算组织一支有一定文化水平、写作能力和政治质量较高的写作队伍与他们合作去写。
    通过这一时期的工作，我们一个比较深刻的体验是：不论在组织发动上，或具体写作上都必须贯彻领导与群众相结合的工作方法。事实说明：我区重点文艺创作指挥部成立以后，由于第一书记挂帅、宣传部领导亲自动手，各级组织就能较快地相应建立起来，而重点文艺创作数目也就很快由原来二十五部上升到六十五部，同时由于领导重视，我们在各项措施上就能及时获得有力的支持。
    总的说来，我区重点文艺创作工作还正在开展，我们打算在各级机构建立和健全以后；群众发动起来，重点创作有相当数量以后，将以较多精力集中于经常性的各种形式的写作辅导活动。我区重点文艺创作工作，基本还是只开了个头，真正能够抓深，抓透，使能按质按量完成党所交给的这项光荣而艰巨的创作任务，显然还有待于全党更大的努力。
