To Prevent Sweet Potatoes from Rotting
Sichuan Launches Mass Collection and Processing Campaign

(Reported by our newspaper) During the intense "Four Autumns" campaign, various regions in Sichuan Province are universally adopting the method of combining large-scale movements with small-scale movements, launching a mass sweet potato storage and processing campaign to ensure that the abundant sweet potato harvest is not only reaped well but also stored well and handled well. Currently, the collection and processing of sweet potatoes throughout the province has greatly accelerated. According to statistics from some special districts, the amount of sweet potatoes collected and processed exceeds more than half of those already harvested.

Sichuan Province's 28 million mu of sweet potatoes has yielded an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, accounting for approximately one-third of the province's total grain output this year. The sweet potato harvest is nearing completion. This huge quantity of grain requires quick storage and processing to avoid spoilage and waste. However, there is currently a labor shortage, and in some places, sweet potato cellars and processing equipment are not adequately prepared. Faced with this situation, Party committees in various regions of Sichuan have resolutely criticized the erroneous thinking that "there are so many sweet potatoes, it doesn't matter if some rot" and "the quantity is too large to process in time," and have launched a mass movement to process sweet potatoes.

Most regions have combined the sweet potato harvesting work with the deployment of certain labor forces to carry out "assault weeks" and "assault days," digging, processing, and storing simultaneously. Xichong County this year has more than 40% of its cultivated land planted with sweet potatoes, and the output is five and a half times more than last year. Although the county's farmers completed the rush harvest in one week, many people neglected storage work. The Xichong County Party Committee led the farmers of each commune to launch a major debate on "Should the grain in hand be allowed to rot?" Immediately following this, a rush storage movement was organized. During the movement, secretaries of Party organizations at all levels took action, cadres were assigned to specific areas to take responsibility, and there were dedicated personnel at each level for management. Specialized management teams were established for inspection. In just two days, more than 70% of the total sweet potato output was put into cellars. PingShan County recently launched a "Sweet Potato Processing Week." The farmers used flour mills, stone rollers, and various self-made tools to process the sweet potatoes quickly, producing a large amount of sweet potato starch.

After mobilizing the masses, the problems of insufficient sweet potato cellars and inadequate tools were quickly resolved. Farmers in Leshan, Wanxian, Xichong, and other places created methods to use earthen walls and bamboo fences to replace cellars for storing sweet potatoes or have commune members manage them in a decentralized manner. In Fushun County, by mobilizing the masses, more than 30,000 new cellars and more than 1,000 new processing plants were built in a few days, and a large number of slicing machines and grinding machines were manufactured, capable of processing more than 800 million jin of sweet potatoes.

    不让甘薯腐烂
    四川开展群众性收藏加工运动
    本报讯  四川省各地在紧张的“四秋”运动中，普遍采取大运动套小运动的办法，开展群众性的红苕（甘薯）保管和加工运动，保证把丰收的红苕不但收好，而且藏好、处理好。目前全省红苕收藏、加工大大加快，据部分专区统计，都超过已收红苕的一半以上。
    四川省二千八百万亩红苕今年空前丰收，将占全省今年粮食总产量三分之一左右。现在全省红苕已接近收完。这批数量庞大的粮食要求很快藏好和加工好才能避免霉烂和浪费。但是当前劳力紧张，有的地方薯窖和加工设备也准备不及。四川各地党委面对这一情况，坚决批判了那种认为“红苕很多，烂点没什么”以及“数量太大，处理不及”的错误认识，大搞群众性处理红苕运动。
    各地大都结合收薯工作，抽出一定劳力搞突击周、突击日，随挖、随加工、随收藏。西充县今年全县红苕面积占耕地的40％多，产量比去年多五倍半，全县的农民虽然以一周时间抢收完毕，但是许多人却忽视收藏工作。西充县委领导各社农民展开了“到手粮食应不应该烂？” 的大辩论，紧接着就组织抢藏运动。运动中，各级党组织书记动手，干部分片包干，层层有专人管理，并建立专业管理队验收，只两天时间就把占总产量70％以上的红苕全部入窖。屏山县最近展开了“红苕处理周”，农民们用粉磨、石碾和各种自制工具进行加工，很快就生产了大量红苕淀粉。
    发动群众以后，薯窖不足、工具不够的问题很快得到解决。乐山、万县、西充等地农民创造了利用土围墙、竹栏等代替窖堆存红苕或由社员们分散保管。富顺县发动群众，几天中就新打窖三万多个，新建加工厂一千多个，造出大量切片机、磨粉机，能处理红苕八亿多斤。  （于竟祁）
