According to Yunnan Daily news, the safety protection work at the Baitanyao Reservoir in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province, is well done, making it a safe construction site in the county, which has also improved work efficiency.

There are more than 5,000 migrant workers working at the Baitanyao Reservoir construction site, 60% of whom are new migrant workers and building water conservancy projects for the first time. They are very enthusiastic, especially after launching the Red Flag competition, their enthusiasm is even greater. However, they generally do not understand safe operating techniques and lack safety knowledge. They said, "We have mined coal, built roads, and climbed mountains, what is this project?" Thinking, "We have drilled so many coal holes, what is digging this bit of 'immortal soil'?" In the early stage of construction, the leaders of the construction site did not pay enough attention to safety work and did not take effective measures. Some cadres even had the idea that "major projects inevitably have minor loopholes" and neglected safety protection work. Therefore, the second company of migrant workers in Qingmen Township had an accident while digging soil due to digging "immortal soil."

After the accident, the construction site Party committee attached great importance to it, conducted a safety work inspection, and immediately convened an emergency meeting of more than 200 cadres at the company commander level and above to review the insufficient attention paid to safety and hygiene work in the previous period. The migrant workers also organized discussions. During the discussion, they said: "We must pay attention to safety in major matters, and we must also pay attention to safety in minor matters." Wang Zhengxi, a migrant worker from Shaoxiang Township, used to think that stone cannons have great explosive power and earthen cannons have little explosive power, so he only hid from stone cannons but not from earthen cannons. As a result, an earthen cannon scraped his leg. After discussing this matter, everyone solved the problem of new migrant workers not paying attention to safety, and all said, "Even after crossing a big river, a small river can still capsize." In order to effectively carry out safety protection work, the construction site Party committee also convened party and Youth League branch meetings and party group expanded meetings to mobilize party and Youth League members to take the lead in paying attention to safety protection work. On the basis of thorough ideological work, cadres and migrant workers were mobilized to discuss and formulate "Safe Operating Procedures." In order to implement the safe operating procedures, the construction site Party committee also held an on-site meeting on pile driving and soil extraction. More than 50 platoon leaders and company commanders visited the site, and Li Shike, the company commander of Xintian Township migrant worker company, introduced his experience and publicized operating procedures and safety knowledge. The construction site Party committee also held an on-site meeting on blasting issues and specially trained a professional team for ignition and blasting.

In addition, the Party organization also tightly grasped the blasting, soil extraction, and transportation links where accidents are likely to occur, assigned capable cadres to lead, and prevented the occurrence of accidents. The construction of the water diversion channel is a key project of 7,800 cubic meters of earth (stone), of which stone accounts for 60%, which needs to be blasted entirely, which is prone to accidents. When blasting, they designated the blasting positions and the experienced blasting team was responsible for loading and firing. This professional team was led by Zhou Binghe, the company commander with four years of blasting experience. During construction, "three no digs" were implemented: no digging of "immortal soil," no digging of high slopes above 1.5 meters, and no digging of steep slopes; "three no firings" were implemented: no firing of rock mouths, no firing if the cannon is less than three cubic meters of earth (stone), and no firing of sky cannons; and the "four fixings" were adhered to: fixed points, fixed times, fixed personnel, and fixed areas to ensure safety. Each working point also adhered to construction from high to low, from top to bottom, layer by layer. Thanks to these efforts, no casualties have occurred in the entire water diversion channel project, which involved firing 4,000 cannons and five large cannons. In addition, all cadres also served as four staff members: commander, combatant, propagandist, and safety inspector. Every day during construction, "three inspections" were carried out: checking attendance in the morning, checking safety at noon, and checking work efficiency in the evening. During the Red Flag competition, safety was also listed as an important item, with small inspections every three days and large inspections every five days. Regular inspections were also carried out on soil extraction, transportation, and vehicles.

As a result of the above work, this reservoir construction site was rated as a "safe construction site."

    云南白炭窑水库加强教育制定操作规程
    水利工地成为安全工地
    据云南日报消息  云南昭通县白炭窑水库安全保护作得很好，成为该县的安全工地，因此，工效也随着提高。
    白炭窑水库工地有五千多民工上阵，他们当中有60％是新民工，都是第一次修水利。他们干劲大，特别是开展红旗竞赛后，干劲更大。但是他们一般不懂安全操作技术，缺乏安全常识。他们说：“挖过煤炭，修过公路，爬过大山，干这点工程算什么？”认为：“煤洞子都钻过多少，挖这点神仙土算什么。”工地领导在施工初期对工地安全工作也注意的不够，没有采取有效措施，有些干部还存在“大工程难免出小漏洞”的思想，忽视安全保护工作。因此，箐门乡民工第二连在挖土时，就由于挖神仙土，出了事故。
    事故发生以后，工地党委十分重视，进行了安全工作的检查，并立即召开了二百多人参加的连长以上干部的紧急会议，对前一段安全卫生工作注意不够作了检查。民工们也组织了讨论。在讨论中，他们说：“大事要注意安全，小事也要注意安全”。邵子乡民工连的民工王正秀，他过去认为：石炮爆破力大，土炮爆破力小，只躲石炮不躲土炮，结果，土炮把他的腿擦破了皮。大家就这件事讨论后，解决了新民工不注意安全的思想，都说：“就是过了大河，小河也会翻船。”为了切实作好安全保护工作，工地党委又召开了党、团支部大会、党小组扩大会议，动员党、团员带头注意安全保护工作。在思想工作作透的基础上，又发动干部和民工们讨论制定了“安全操作规程”。为了贯彻安全操作规程，工地党委还召开了排桩取土现场会议，五十多个排长、连长进行现场参观，由新田乡民工连连长李世克介绍经验，宣传操作规程和安全知识。工地党委还就爆破问题开了一次现场会议，并专门训练了点火、放炮的专业队伍。
    除此以外，党组织还紧紧抓住容易发生事故的爆破、取土、运输几个环节，派得力干部领导，杜绝事故的发生。筑输水道是一个七千八百个土（石）方的重点工程，其中石方占60％，需要全部采用爆破，容易发生事故。他们便在放炮时，指定炮位，并由经验丰富的爆破队负责装药、点火，这个专业队又由有四年放炮经验的连长周柄和领导。在施工时，做到了“三不挖”，不挖神仙土、不挖一公尺五以上的高坡，不挖陡坡；“三不放”，岩口石不放，炮不足三个土（石）方不放，冲天炮不放；还坚持实行“四定”：定点、定时、定人、定区，保证了安全。每个工点也都坚持了由高到低，自上而下，层层施工。由于作了这些工作，在整个输水道工程中，放了四千炮和五个大炮，从未发生过伤亡事故。此外，所有干部还一身兼四员：指挥员、战斗员、宣传员、安全检查员。每天施工作到“三查”，早上查出工，中午查安全，晚上查工效。在开展红旗竞赛时，也把安全列为一项重要内容，作到三天一小查，五天一大查。在取土、运输、车子等方面，也都经常进行检查。
    由于进行了以上工作，这个水库工地评为“安全工地”。
