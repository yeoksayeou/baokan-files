    Cheer for the Great Seven-Year Plan
    Lin Ling
    The higher we push the various stages of development in human history, the longer the time, and the later we get, the shorter the time. The stage of primitive man is calculated in hundreds of thousands of years, the primitive society is calculated in tens of thousands of years, and the slave society and feudal society are calculated in thousands of years. Capitalist society is the shortest, with only two hundred years of history, and it will be replaced by socialist society. Socialist development is even faster, calculated in decades. It has only been a little over forty years since the October Revolution, and only a little over twenty years since the Soviet Union built socialism. Now the Soviet Union has announced a seven-year plan to accelerate the development of the national economy and gradually transition to a communist society.
    Human progress is manifested in the pursuit of speed; the more progress, the faster the development. When mankind's highest ideal—communist society—is realized, it will be an endless period of hundreds of millions of years.
    Comrade Khrushchev said in the outline of the Seven-Year Plan that the fundamental issue of the seven years is to maximize the winning of time. Why is this proposed? Comrade Khrushchev said that because now is the decisive stage of the competition between socialism and the capitalist world.
    This is the content of our era. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out last year that a new turning point has emerged in the international situation. The socialist camp has gained the upper hand, and the imperialist camp has gained the disadvantage. The East Wind, representing the new world of mankind, has prevailed over the West Wind of the old world. The task of the people of the world is to accelerate the demise of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and end the old world as soon as possible.
    Imperialism has brought heavy disasters to mankind. They only do bad things and must be ended quickly.
    Ending the old world is also building the new world. The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan is a plan to accelerate the construction of the new world. Last year, during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union proposed a long-term plan for the development of the national economy over fifteen years. The current situation of the international decisive battle requires further acceleration, and the seven-year plan is almost to complete the tasks of the fifteen-year plan.
    The reason why such a magnificent seven-year plan can be proposed is precisely to illustrate the superiority of socialism. Socialist countries can follow scientifically formulated plans to gradually, steadily, and quickly move towards communism. The socialist system will inevitably win in peaceful competition.
    Today, the Soviet Union's industrial output accounts for 20% of the world's output, and the output of the entire socialist camp accounts for one-third. When the seven-year plan is completed, it will reach one-half, or perhaps even more. What a great force that is!
    Fast speed and large scale are the characteristics of the construction of the socialist camp and the characteristics of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. The successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan will first enable a part of mankind to make a huge leap forward on the road of development towards communism. The realization of communism is no longer a distant matter. The great significance of the Seven-Year Plan lies in this. Let us cheer to our heart's content!

    欢呼伟大的七年计划
    林陵
    人类历史的各个发展阶段越往上推，时间越长，越到后来，时间越短。原人阶段是用几十万年来计算的，原始社会是用几万年来计算的，奴隶社会和封建社会是用几千年来计算的。资本主义社会最短，只有二百年的历史，它将要被社会主义社会代替了。社会主义发展更迅速，是用几十年来计算的。十月革命到现在还只有四十年多一点，苏联建成社会主义也只有二十年多一点，现在苏联公布了七年计划，要加速国民经济的发展，逐步过渡到共产主义社会去。
    人类的进步表现在速度的追求上，愈进步，发展愈快。等到人类最高理想——共产主义社会实现后，那就将亿万斯年绵绵无尽期了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在七年计划的提纲里说，七年的根本问题就是最大限度地赢得时间的问题。为什么要这样提呢？赫鲁晓夫同志说，因为现在是社会主义同资本主义世界竞赛的决定阶段。
    这是我们这个时代的内容。毛泽东同志在去年指出，在国际形势中已经出现了新的转折点，社会主义阵营已经占了上风，帝国主义阵营已经占了下风，代表人类新世界的东风，已经压倒了旧世界的西风。全世界人民的任务是加快帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的灭亡，早日结束旧世界。
    帝国主义给人类带来重重灾难，他们尽做坏事，必须快些把它结束。
    结束旧世界也就是建设新世界。苏联的七年计划就是加快建设新世界的计划。去年庆祝十月革命四十周年时，苏联曾提出十五年发展国民经济的远景计划，目前国际上的决战形势，要求更进一步加快速度，七年计划几乎就是要完成十五年规划的任务。
    这样宏伟的七年计划所以能够提出，正可以说明社会主义的优越性。社会主义国家能够按照科学地制定的计划，逐步地、稳步地而且是快步地走向共产主义。社会主义体系必然要在和平竞赛中取得胜利。
    今天苏联的工业生产量已占全世界产量的20％，整个社会主义阵营的产量占三分之一，七年计划完成的时候，将达到二分之一，也可能更多一些。那是多么伟大的力量啊！
    速度快，规模大，这就是社会主义阵营建设的特点，苏联七年计划的特点。七年计划的胜利完成将首先使人类的一部分在走向共产主义的发展道路上来一次巨大的跃进，共产主义的实现不再是遥远的事了。七年计划的伟大意义就在于此，让我们尽情地欢呼吧！
