Commentary on the French Political Situation

The French National Assembly election has concluded. Although the French Communist Party obtained approximately 20% of the vote, it only holds 2% of the seats. This ridiculous election result vividly demonstrates the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy. All well-intentioned people who still harbor illusions about bourgeois democracy should draw a conclusion from this French election and discard their illusions from now on.

The emergence of such a ridiculous election result in France today is not surprising at all. This is the inevitable result of the development of the French political situation after De Gaulle came to power on June 1st of this year. De Gaulle relied on the bayonets of fascist armed rioters to seize power; then he manipulated the farce of a referendum, imposing the "Fifth Republic Constitution," which concentrates power in the president and reduces the parliament to a mere decoration, on the French people; then he formulated a set of election laws aimed at excluding the French Communist Party, to ensure that the parliament becomes a plaything of the dictator. All this, plus the presidential election to be held in a few weeks, completes the entire design of the "Fifth Republic." The democratic traditions of which the French bourgeoisie was so proud have been abandoned, and parliamentary politics have given way to military dictatorship.

From maintaining bourgeois democracy to abandoning bourgeois democracy, from parliamentary politics to military dictatorship, this is undoubtedly a turning point in the history of French bourgeois rule and a major change in French political life. So, why did such a turning point occur in France, a country with a long tradition of bourgeois democracy? Is it a sign of their strength that the French big bourgeoisie, represented by De Gaulle, dares to blatantly exclude the democratic forces led by the French Communist Party and impose a military dictatorship on the French people? What impact will this reactionary situation in French politics have on France and even Western Europe?

The rightward turn in French politics is primarily inseparable from the changes in the balance of class forces within France and the bankruptcy of the domestic and foreign reactionary policies of the French bourgeois ruling group. The French bourgeoisie played a disgraceful role in the last war by selling out the interests of the French nation, surrendering to fascist Germany, and burying the Third Republic, losing all credibility among the French people. This class greatly lost its vitality in the course of the war, and the strength of the part of the bourgeoisie that collaborated with Hitler's Germany (i.e., the Vichy elements) was further weakened to a considerable extent due to Hitler's defeat. After the war, it was mainly due to the support of the United States and Britain that this class was able to usurp the fruits of the French people's victory and regain its ruling position in the Fourth Republic. However, this ruling position was far from consolidated. On the one hand, a powerful democratic force led by the French Communist Party emerged in France itself after the war; on the other hand, overseas, the national independence movements of the colonial peoples, inspired by the great victory of the anti-fascist war, were impacting the French colonial empire on an unstoppable scale. In order to consolidate its ruling position, the French bourgeoisie adopted reactionary policies of excluding democratic forces, waging colonial wars, and relying on US imperialism.

However, the French bourgeoisie's implementation of these reactionary policies did not manage to preserve their colonial empire or consolidate their ruling position. The eight-year "dirty war" in Indochina ended with the French colonists being driven out of Indochina; the colonial war in Algeria, which has lasted for more than four years to date, has also done nothing to maintain the African colonial system. The French colonial empire is falling apart even more. Twelve years of colonial wars have brought the French people a heavy burden of military expenditure, huge personnel sacrifices, and impoverishment of life. The few "US aid" dollars obtained by relying on the United States cannot fill the bottomless pit of colonial wars, nor can they solve France's financial crisis; France has been forced to undertake the obligations of aggressive military blocs and arms expansion and war preparations as a result of accepting "US aid." This has made France's strength increasingly weak and its dependence on the United States increasingly great. The United States, in its capacity as leader and creditor, is squeezing out French influence everywhere, and the French bourgeoisie can only swallow its humiliation and put on a brave face in the face of the aggressive US imperialism. France's international status has been greatly reduced. All these disastrous consequences cannot but arouse dissatisfaction and opposition among the French people, and the democratic forces led by the French Communist Party are growing stronger in the struggle to resolutely demand a change in government policy and in the struggle to bravely resist the ruling class's frenzied persecution. Within the French bourgeoisie, the contradictions and divisions between the various parties representing the interests of different groups on how to conduct colonial wars and solve the financial crisis, as well as on the tactical issues of foreign policy, have deepened and become more apparent.

The failure of reactionary policies, the pressure of democratic forces, and the division within the bourgeoisie—these are the reasons that have caused the twenty-odd cabinets in France to collapse one after another in the past ten years or so since the war. On the eve of De Gaulle's coming to power, the right-wing socialist party leader Mollet, who was actually an agent of the bourgeoisie, frantically clamored "rather have De Gaulle than the Popular Front" precisely because the French bourgeoisie was in a very unfavorable position in the balance of class forces within the country. French President Coty's lament that "France is a country facing the most terrible problems, and on the other hand, it is also a country with the most fragile and therefore the weakest government" illustrates that the rule of the French bourgeoisie is on the verge of collapse. The French bourgeoisie is so weak that it can no longer rule in the old way. They put De Gaulle forward as a tool to continue maintaining their power, and De Gaulle took advantage of the French people's dissatisfaction with the rule of the bourgeois parties of the Fourth Republic and their aversion to bourgeois democracy, and put up the banner of "reform." The promises he made of "stabilizing the political situation," "pursuing an independent diplomacy," and "solving the Algerian problem," etc., also contributed to the illusions of a considerable number of French people about him. At the same time, some forces within the bourgeois parties that opposed dictatorial rule, constrained by their anti-communist prejudices, refused to cooperate with the French Communist Party. Here, it must be emphasized that the right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party betrayed the working class and adopted a shameful policy of surrendering to De Gaulle. Mollet and his ilk ran to De Gaulle's door, doing everything possible to whitewash De Gaulle's reactionary face and pave the way for De Gaulle to come to power, and put a legal veneer on the dictatorial regime. The "Fourth French Republic" was thus buried.

However, all that De Gaulle has achieved today is the seizure of power. Having power does not mean having the ability to solve the serious situation facing the French ruling group.

First of all, the De Gaulle government is powerless on the most important colonial issue. The Republic of Algeria and the Republic of Guinea were declared successively after De Gaulle came to power, which was a head-on blow to De Gaulle's dream of maintaining the French colonial empire. De Gaulle stubbornly regards Algeria as part of France, on the one hand using the "five-year reconstruction plan" and "equal status with the people of mainland France" to deceive and divide the Algerian people, and on the other hand increasing war expenditure, deploying troops and generals, and actively expanding the offensive against the Algerian National Liberation Army. However, the Algerian people's determination to persist in independence is unshakable. Any political conspiracy will only be spurned, and expanding military aggression will inevitably lead to greater failure. The Algerian War was the fuse that led to the collapse of the recent French cabinets and will continue to be the death knell of the De Gaulle regime. The foundations of North Africa have collapsed, and the flames of West Africa are burning. The De Gaulle government will absolutely not be able to extricate itself from the tightening noose around the necks of French colonialists.

Secondly, De Gaulle cannot establish a truly stable and strong regime. Although he used deceptive and threatening means to force the passage of the dictatorial "Constitution" and used election manipulation to deprive the French Communist Party of its seats in the parliament, the anti-fascist forces centered on the French Communist Party have a broad mass base and a strong fighting will. They will not allow De Gaulle to lead France down the path of fascism. The De Gaulle government's expansion of the war of aggression against Algeria has deteriorated and will continue to deteriorate France's financial situation; it is also at a loss in the face of the severe economic crisis, and has only adopted reactionary measures such as freezing wages and restricting agricultural product prices. This has deepened the dissatisfaction of the working people and directly impacted De Gaulle's rule. The various fascist and right-wing forces that brought De Gaulle to power also hold different views on various important issues, especially the Algerian issue, because of their own interests; the development of contradictions and struggles between them will inevitably affect the stability of the De Gaulle regime.

The French bourgeoisie's "Le Monde" commented after the referendum: "If he (referring to De Gaulle) cannot solve France's major problems, then the whole country will quickly turn against him." This shows that even the French bourgeoisie does not think that the De Gaulle regime is all smooth sailing.

The political situation that has emerged in France today is certainly a bad thing for the French people. The French people will temporarily endure the disasters brought about by the De Gaulle regime's reactionary nature, their democratic rights will be further deprived, and France's democratic forces will be in a more difficult situation. However, from the long-term interests of the French people, the temporary rampantness of the reactionary forces is not necessarily a bad thing. The French reactionary forces, which De Gaulle concentratedly represents, are a toxin that has long been lurking in French political life. Now that there is a toxin, and the toxin has been released, the French people can improve their ability to resist the toxin and be tempered in the struggle. These days, all the reactionary forces in the world are gleefully talking about the so-called "failure of the French Communist Party," and they are laughing too early. The French democratic forces, led by the French Communist Party, which resolutely oppose De Gaulle's dictatorial path, represent the true freedom of will of the French people and are the core force of the French people. Those who are temporarily blinded and intimidated and have lost their ability to judge, with the French Communist Party as a positive teacher and De Gaulle as a negative teacher, will soon be able to see through its true nature from the actions of the De Gaulle regime, dispel their illusions about De Gaulle, and eventually unite around the French democratic forces and increasingly embark on the path of revolutionization.

The entire process of France being led to fascism by De Gaulle is also a good thing with educational significance for the people of other Western European countries. The fate of France, a country that once prided itself on bourgeois democracy, today most clearly shows that bourgeois parliamentary politics is only a ruling tool that the bourgeoisie is ready to abandon at any time. The fate of France also most clearly shows the harmfulness of national chauvinism to the people of those Western European countries that also possess colonies; here, the brilliant truth of Marxism that "a nation that oppresses other nations cannot be a free nation" is once again confirmed. The path that France has taken and is taking will guide the people of Western European countries to raise their awareness, increasingly unite around the communist parties of various countries, completely eliminate any illusions about bourgeois democracy, strengthen the revolutionary struggle, and accelerate the death of the decadent capitalist system and the hypocritical bourgeois democratic system!

In the past years, there have been more than one instance of temporary or local countercurrents, but countercurrents have never been able to stop the mainstream of history. We believe in all the people's and new forces and despise the forces of imperialism and all reactionaries. The countercurrent of the fascist threat that is currently appearing in the French political situation, no matter how rampant it may be for a while, will eventually be shattered on the rock of the French people's strength!

    评法国政局
    法国国民议会选举已经结束。法国共产党虽然获得约20％的选票，却只占有2％的议席。这种可笑的选举结果生动地证明了资产阶级民主的虚伪性。一切善良的对资产阶级民主尚抱有幻想的人们，应该从这次的法国选举中得出结论，从此可以丢掉他们的幻想了。
    今天的法国出现这种可笑的选举结果，是完全不奇怪的。这是今年6月1日戴高乐上台后的法国政治局势发展的必然结果。戴高乐依靠法西斯武装暴乱分子的刺刀而攫取政权；然后玩弄公民投票的把戏，集权力于总统一身、降议会为装饰品的“第五共和国宪法”强加在法国人民身上；然后制定一套其目的在于排挤法共的选举法，以确保议会成为独裁者的玩物。这一切，再加上数星期后就要进行的总统选举，就完成了“第五共和国”的全部设计。法国资产阶级所自豪的民主传统从此被抛弃，议会政治从此让位于军事独裁。
    从维持资产阶级民主到抛弃资产阶级民主，从议会政治到军事独裁，这无疑是法国资产阶级统治史上的一个转折点，是法国政治生活中的一个大变局。那么，为什么在法国这样一个具有长久的资产阶级民主传统的国家，会发生这样一个转折呢？以戴高乐为代表的法国大资产阶级今天敢于猖狂地排斥以法国共产党为首的民主力量，敢于把军事独裁制度强加在法国人民的头上，这是不是表明他们的力量强大呢？法国政治上这种反动局面的出现，对于法国以至西欧又将发生什么样的影响呢？
    法国政局的向右转，首先是同法国国内阶级力量对比的变化、同法国资产阶级统治集团的内外反动政策陷于破产这一基本形势分不开的。法国的资产阶级在上次大战中扮演了出卖法国民族利益、投降法西斯德国、葬送第三共和国的可耻角色，在法国人民群众中威信扫地。这个阶级在战争的过程中大大丧失了元气，同希特勒德国合作的那一部分资产阶级（即维希分子）的力量，更由于希特勒的复灭而受到相当程度的削弱。战后主要是由于美英两国的支持，这个阶级才得以篡夺法国人民的胜利果实，在第四共和国中重新取得了统治地位。但是，这个统治地位远不是巩固的。一方面，在法国本土，战后出现了空前强大的以法国共产党为首的民主力量；另一方面，在海外，为反法西斯战争的伟大胜利所鼓舞起来的殖民地人民的民族独立运动，以势不可当的规模冲击着法兰西殖民帝国。为了巩固它的统治地位，法国资产阶级采取了排斥民主力量、进行殖民战争和依附美帝国主义的反动政策。
    但是，法国资产阶级执行这种反动政策，并没有能够保住他们的殖民帝国和巩固他们的统治地位。在印度支那进行了八年的“肮脏战争”，以法国殖民者被赶出印度支那而结束；在阿尔及利亚进行的迄今四年余的殖民战争，也无助于保持非洲的殖民体系。法兰西殖民帝国是更加分崩离析了。十二年的殖民战争带给法国人民的是沉重的军费负担、巨大的人员牺牲和生活的贫困化。投靠美国所换来的一些“美援”，既填补不了殖民战争的无底洞，也解决不了法国的财政危机；法国却因接受了“美援”而被迫承担侵略性军事集团和扩军备战的义务。这就使得法国的力量越来越虚弱，对美国的依赖性越来越增长。美国以盟主和债主的身份到处排挤法国的势力，而法国资产阶级在咄咄逼人的美帝国主义面前，只能忍羞负辱，强作欢颜，法国的国际地位大大降低。这一切灾难性的后果，不能不引起法国人民的不满和反对，以法国共产党为首的民主力量在坚决要求改变政府政策的斗争和奋勇反抗统治阶级的疯狂迫害的斗争中日益壮大起来。在法国资产阶级内部，代表不同集团利益的各个政党，在如何进行殖民战争和解决财政危机的问题上，以及在外交政策的策略问题上的矛盾和分歧，则日益加深和表面化。
    反动政策的碰壁，民主力量的压力，资产阶级内部的分裂——这就是促使战后十多年来法国二十几届内阁一届一届地倒了下来的原因。在戴高乐上台的前夕，实际上是资产阶级代理人的右翼社会党头子摩勒所以疯狂地叫嚣“宁愿要戴高乐，不要人民阵线”，就是因为法国资产阶级在国内阶级力量的对比中已经处于十分不利的地位。法国总统戈蒂悲鸣“法兰西共和国是遭遇着最可怕的问题的一个国家，另一方面也是政府最脆弱因而也最软弱的一个国家”，这一番话说明了法国资产阶级的统治已经面临崩溃。法国资产阶级已经软弱到不能再按老样子统治下去了。他们抬出了戴高乐作为他们继续保持政权的工具，而戴高乐则利用了法国人民对第四共和国的资产阶级政党统治的不满和对资产阶级民主的厌恶，打出了“革新”的幌子。他所开出的“稳定政局”、“执行独立外交”和“解决阿尔及利亚问题”等等支票，也促成了为数不少的法国人民对他的幻想。同时，资产阶级政党中一部分反对独裁统治的力量，囿于反共成见，拒绝和法共合作。在这里，必须着重指出社会党右翼领导集团的叛卖工人阶级和投降戴高乐的可耻政策。摩勒之流奔走于戴高乐的门下，百般粉饰戴高乐的反动面目为戴高乐上台开辟道路，替独裁政权披上了合法外衣，“法兰西第四共和国”就这样被埋葬了。
    然而，今天戴高乐所做到的只是攫取了权力，有了权力并不等于具有了解决法国统治集团所面临的严重局势的能力。
    首先，在最主要的殖民地问题上，戴高乐政府就是无能为力的。阿尔及利亚共和国和几内亚共和国在戴高乐上台后先后宣布成立，这对戴高乐企图维持法兰西殖民帝国的迷梦，是一个迎头痛击。戴高乐硬把阿尔及利亚当作法国的一部分，一方面用什么“五年复兴计划”和“与法国本土人民同等地位”来欺骗、分化阿尔及利亚人民，另一方面则增拨战费、调兵遣将，积极扩大对阿尔及利亚民族解放军的进攻。但是，阿尔及利亚人民坚持独立的决心是不可动摇的。任何政治阴谋，只会遭到唾弃，扩大军事侵略，必然招致更大的失败。阿尔及利亚战争曾经是促使法国最近几届内阁垮台的导火线，将继续成为戴高乐政权的催命符。北非的根基已经坍塌，西非的烈火正在燃烧。戴高乐政府绝对无法解脱套在法国殖民主义者脖子上的、愈拉愈紧的绞索。
    其次，戴高乐也不可能建立一个真正稳定的和强有力的政权。尽管他用欺骗和威胁的手段强迫通过了独裁“宪法”，又用玩弄选举的手法剥夺了法国共产党在议会中的席位，但是，以法国共产党为中心的反法西斯力量是有广泛的群众基础和坚强的战斗意志的。他们不容许戴高乐把法国引向法西斯化。戴高乐政府扩大侵略阿尔及利亚的战争，已经恶化了并且还将继续恶化法国的财政状况；对严重的经济危机，它又束手无策，而只是采取冻结工资和限制农产品价格等等反动措施。这就加深了劳动人民的不满，直接冲击了戴高乐的统治。把戴高乐捧上台的各种法西斯和右翼力量，也因为本身的利益而在各项重要问题特别是阿尔及利亚问题上持有不同的主张；它们之间的矛盾和斗争的发展，必然将影响戴高乐政权的稳定性。
    法国资产阶级的“世界报”在公民投票后发表的评论中说：“如果他（指戴高乐）无法解决法国的各项主要问题，那么全国会很快地转过来反对他。”这就说明，即使是法国资产阶级也并不认为戴高乐政权是诸事大吉的。
    今天在法国出现的政治局势，对法国人民来说诚然是一件坏事。法国人民将暂时承受由于戴高乐政权的反动性而带来的灾难，他们的民主权利将遭到进一步的剥夺，法国的民主力量将处于更加困难的境地。但是，从法国人民的长远利益来看，反动势力的猖獗一时，也未尝不是一件好事。戴高乐所集中代表的法国反动势力，是长期潜伏在法国政治生活中的毒素。既然有了毒，把毒放了出来，法国人民就可以提高抗毒的能力，在斗争中经受锻炼。这些日子里，全世界一切反动的力量都在兴高采烈地侈谈所谓“法国共产党的失败”，他们未免笑得太早了。由法国共产党领导的坚决反对戴高乐独裁道路的法国民主力量，是代表了法国人民的真正自由意志，是法国人民的核心力量。今天受蒙蔽和威吓而暂时失去了判断能力的人们，既有法共作为正面教员，又有戴高乐作为反面教员，他们不久就能够从戴高乐政权的所作所为中看穿它的真正性质，破除对戴高乐的幻想，最终将团结在法国民主力量的周围，日益走上革命化的道路。
    法国被戴高乐引向法西斯化的全部过程，对于其他西欧国家的人民也是一件富有教育意义的好事。法国这样一个曾经以资产阶级民主自豪的国家今天的遭遇，最清楚不过地表明了资产阶级议会政治只是资产阶级随时准备予以抛弃的一种统治工具而已。法国的遭遇对于那些也拥有殖民地的西欧国家的人民，还最清楚不过地表明了民族沙文主义的危害性；在这里，又一次证实了“压迫其他民族的民族，是不能成为自由的民族的”这一马克思主义的光辉真理。法国走过的道路以至正在走着的道路，将会引导西欧各国人民提高觉悟，日益团结在各国共产党的周围，彻底解除对资产阶级民主的任何幻想，加强革命斗争，加速腐朽的资本主义制度和资产阶级虚伪民主制度的死亡！
    在过去的岁月中，曾经不止一次地发生过一时或一地的逆流，但是，逆流从来不能阻挡历史的主流。我们相信一切人民的和新生的力量而蔑视帝国主义和一切反动派的力量。目前在法国政治局势中出现的法西斯威胁的逆流，不论它一时多么猖狂，最终必然在法国人民力量的岩石面前碰得粉碎！
