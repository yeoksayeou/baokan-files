The Imperialist Struggle for Africa
陶恺

Divide, Divide, and Divide Again

The rich continent of Africa has always been an important target for imperialist countries in their scramble for colonies and spheres of influence. With the development of the African national independence movement, the imperialist struggle has become even more acute. American imperialism is taking advantage of the decline of the old colonial powers, intensifying its colonial expansion in Africa, and has become the most ferocious enemy of the African national independence movement.

Before the 20th century, the African continent was divided by colonial countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal. The current administrative regions of Africa were largely defined at the Berlin Conference in 1885, where these colonial countries divided Africa. After Germany's defeat in World War I, its African colonies, including Equatorial Africa, Togo, Cameroon, Tanganyika, and Southwest Africa, were annexed by the victorious powers, Britain and France.

After the outbreak of World War II, the imperialist struggle for Africa entered a new stage. Taking advantage of the inability of old European colonial powers like Britain and France to manage, the United States launched a large-scale invasion of the African continent under the guise of wartime needs.

In November 1942, as the United States landed in North Africa, it immediately sent numerous economic delegations to North Africa, Congo, West Africa, Ethiopia, Liberia, and South Africa to conduct activities. The American "Christian Science Monitor" ambitiously declared: "The war is the first to bring the United States and the vast African continent into a close prospect of trade relations and base relationships."

Because Britain relied on American aid during the war, it was forced to open the doors of its African colonies to the United States. According to the so-called "Reverse Lend-Lease Act" implemented in June 1943, the aid the United States provided to Britain during the war could be offset by materials from British colonies. As a result, the United States became the largest buyer of African mineral resources and agricultural products, and American goods also poured into the African market in large quantities. During the entire war, the African materials plundered by the United States under the so-called "Reverse Lend-Lease Act" amounted to $215 million, and the gains plundered by other methods far exceeded this figure. Therefore, by the end of the war, American influence had penetrated the African continent in many ways; the "principle of equal opportunity in trade" promoted by U.S. State Department officials had "maintained a supreme position" in Africa. The old European imperialist countries and their African colonies were one by one locked in the chains of the dollar.

The United States Came from Behind

After the war, American colonial forces invaded Africa on an even larger scale. The "Marshall Plan," dubbed the "European Recovery Program," was a powerful tool for large-scale American invasion of Africa. According to the "Marshall Plan," the purpose of "African economic development" was to "strengthen the economies of the countries participating in the development plan—that is, the Western European colonial countries" while "the interests of the African people are considered first." The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, the Export-Import Bank, and the World Bank, controlled by the United States, then launched large-scale activities in Africa. The activities of these American institutions, on the one hand, found outlets for surplus industrial products in the United States; on the other hand, they also paved the way for investment by American private enterprises. Therefore, since 1950, American private capital has followed and, together with American "aid" and "loans" of various kinds, has carried out frantic colonial expansion. Important mineral deposits such as uranium in South Africa and Congo, copper and niobium in Rhodesia, manganese in Middle Congo, Gabon, and Ghana, and molybdenum, zinc, and aluminum in Equatorial Africa have been controlled or penetrated by American capital. In addition, a large portion of American investment in Africa is concentrated in oil exploration and exploitation, estimated to account for one-third to one-half of all investment. In Algeria, Libya, Somaliland, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Mozambique, Spanish Sahara, Portuguese Guinea, Angola, Kenya, and Nigeria, the frantic activities of American oil consortiums can be seen. Among them, Algeria is the focus of American oil consortium activities. Today, on the vast and rich African continent, most regions are directly or indirectly controlled by American capital to varying degrees. Currently, U.S. private investment alone is estimated at $2 billion, and when combined with U.S. "aid," "loans," and other forms of investment, it far exceeds that of the old European colonial powers.

Along with the expansion of American investment, American political and military activities in Africa have also been significantly strengthened. In the North African region, the United States successively obtained the right to build military bases in Morocco (December 1950) and Libya (September 1954). In East Africa, the United States signed a military agreement with Ethiopia (May 1953), under which the United States trained the Ethiopian army. In Eritrea, the United States also built a military intelligence base. The United States is also eyeing Kenya, a strategic location in East Africa. In 1954, the U.S. Navy visited the area, and the U.S. "Mutual Security Agency" and the World Bank have both proposed loans to improve port facilities there. The United States signed "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreements" with the Union of South Africa and Liberia in November 1951. In addition, the United States has also actively conducted military infiltration activities in other parts of West Africa in recent years.

Resistance from Old Colonial Powers

American colonial expansion in Africa has been met with resistance from old colonial powers such as Britain and France.

In the strategically important North African region, the struggle between imperialist powers is particularly intense. In Libya, in order to resist American infiltration, Britain disrupted the U.S.-Libya military base negotiations in 1953, preemptively signing a twenty-year "Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" with Libya and providing Libya with a $10 million loan. But the United States would never be willing to be second best, and after coercion and enticement, it finally obtained the right to establish a base in 1954. The United States also instigated Libya to demand the withdrawal of French troops from the Fezzan province in order to realize its conspiracy to expand its military bases. On the issue of bases in Morocco, there is also a sharp struggle between the United States and France. France opposed Morocco negotiating the base issue with the United States alone, arguing that it must be resolved jointly by the United States, France, and Morocco. When Nixon visited Morocco in 1957, there was a great uproar in France, and many members of parliament even demanded that the government protest the "unfriendly" actions of the United States. In Tunisia, the contradictions between the United States and France are even more acute. After the French Air Force frantically bombed the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef at the end of last year, the United States immediately appeared as a "mediator," sending Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy to Tunisia to conduct activities. At the end of last year, the United States further offered emergency military "aid" to Tunisia, and Britain also took similar measures. This aroused the extreme dissatisfaction of the French government. In addition, American oil monopolies are trying to invade the Algerian region, especially the Sahara region. Britain, France, and other countries are also extremely uneasy about the infiltration of American forces. The British Broadcasting Corporation had already loudly warned that Britain should not imagine that "African watered by American gold will grow British roses."

In other parts of Africa, the expansion of American power has also been resisted and opposed by old colonial powers.

The Two-Faced Approach of the United States

While the United States excludes colonial forces such as Britain and France, it also supports them. The support of the United States for the old colonial forces, in addition to jointly suppressing the national independence movement, is also to create favorable conditions for the United States to dominate.

The Francis Bolton report of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, published in 1956, stated that the United States "is unwilling to interfere in any way" with the "methods and means" by which European colonial countries rule the African people in expanding its activities to invade Africa. The United States, in Africa as elsewhere, is an active supporter of all forms of colonial rule. Without American military, financial, and diplomatic support, France's colonial war in Algeria would have been impossible to sustain. In Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the British plan to establish the Central African Federation was also supported by the United States. The World Bank once made "establishing a single political federation" a condition for providing loans to Rhodesia. In addition, on issues such as the future of trusteeships and racial discrimination, the old colonial powers have received American support more than once in the United Nations.

However, all this cannot conceal the activities of the United States to seize the spheres of influence of the old colonial powers. With the rise of the African national independence movement, the number of countries that have achieved independence has increased, and many remaining colonies will soon be independent, and the United States has intensified its struggle for Africa. The United States has completely set aside the old European imperialist countries and carried out activities independently in many parts of Africa.

In the past year or so, the United States has established diplomatic embassies and U.S. Information Services in many parts of West Africa and Central Africa. The American Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation have also launched large-scale activities in these regions under the guise of so-called "civilian institutions." The purpose of the United States is nothing more than to cultivate a group of agents before the ruling machinery of the European imperialist countries is overthrown, so that they can replace them when needed. In this way, when an independent country is born, it will become a stillborn under the clutches of the United States.

For the newly independent African countries, the United States uses U.S. "aid" as bait to intensify political and economic infiltration. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Satterthwaite, on the eve of the opening of the All-African People's Conference, once considered the development of the African national independence movement to be a "challenge" to the United States. He advocated that the United States "take action quickly, generously, and wisely" to give African countries "sufficient economic and technical assistance." The United States must "fully seize this opportunity without delay." The "New York Times," in commenting on the formation of the West African Federation core by Ghana and Nigeria, admitted that the purpose of American "aid" was to "influence" the African national independent countries to take a so-called "constructive course of action" in order to facilitate the continuous colonial expansion of the United States.

The African People Want to Be Masters

Africa has awakened, and the African people want to be the masters of Africa. With the intensification of the imperialist scramble and the large-scale invasion of American forces, the African people's struggle for independence and freedom has also become more intense.

The African people have gradually dispelled their previous illusions about the United States. Not long after the "Marshall Plan" was implemented, the African people already felt that the United States was ill-intentioned. A Nigerian said: "The Marshall Plan is a policy of using African resources to serve Europe and the United States. This policy, in its meaning, is absolutely unfavorable to the cause of Africa getting rid of European colonialism and striving for freedom." The U.S. State Department had to admit that there was widespread resentment and hostility towards the "Marshall Plan" among Africans.

Since then, on the issue of military bases in Libya and Morocco, in the Algerian people's struggle for independence, and in the Suez incident, the African people have further recognized the ferocious imperialist face of the United States. The setbacks that Richards encountered in the United Arab Republic, Morocco, and Sudan when promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in some African countries are also of great significance.

The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, attended by representatives from twenty-two African regions and countries, made a special resolution condemning the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and other imperialist acts of aggression. The conference resolution listed various forms of aggression by imperialist countries against Asian and African countries: such as foreign interference in the affairs of other countries; the creation of spheres of influence and the signing of military and political treaties and alliances that endanger world peace and suppress the wishes of the people; treaties that violate national sovereignty; exploitation of the national economies of other countries for imperialism; subversion of national governments; the establishment of foreign military bases and the stationing of foreign troops on the territory of other countries, etc. These crimes of imperialism are precisely the best portrayal of the aggressive activities carried out by the United States in Asia and Africa.

The recent All-African People's Conference also made a strong indictment of imperialism and colonialism and passed corresponding resolutions. The day when the African people control their own destiny and drive all imperialism out of Africa is getting closer and closer.

    帝国主义争夺非洲的斗争
    陶恺
    瓜分、瓜分再瓜分
    富饶的非洲一直是帝国主义国家争夺殖民地和势力范围的重要目标。随着非洲民族独立运动的发展，帝国主义的争夺战更为尖锐化。美帝国主义正在利用老牌殖民主义国家的衰落，在非洲加紧进行着殖民扩张，成了非洲民族独立运动最凶恶的敌人。
    非洲大陆在二十世纪以前是由英、法、德、比利时、葡萄牙等殖民国家所瓜分的。目前非洲行政区域，大体上就是在1885年由这些殖民国家瓜分非洲的柏林会议上划定的。第一次世界大战以后，德国帝国主义战败，它在非洲的殖民地赤道非洲、多哥、喀麦隆、坦葛尼喀和西南非洲等地，也就分别归并于战争的胜利者英、法两国。
    第二次世界大战爆发以后，帝国主义争夺非洲的斗争又进入一个新的阶段。美国利用英法等欧洲老牌殖民国家无法兼顾的机会，在战争需要的幌子下，对非洲大陆展开了大规模的侵略活动。
    1942年11月，美国在北非登陆的同时，立即派出了许多经济代表团分别去北非、刚果、西非、埃塞俄比亚、利比里亚和南非等地进行活动。美国“基督教科学箴言报”野心勃勃地宣布说：战争第一次使美国和巨大的非洲大陆发生密切的贸易联系和基地关系的前景。
    英国由于在战争要依赖美国的援助，被迫向美国打开了非洲殖民地的门户。根据1943年6月实行的所谓“倒转租借法案”的规定，美国在战争时期给予英国的援助，可以用英国殖民地的物资来抵偿。这样，美国就成了非洲矿产资源和农业产品的最大买主，美国货物也大量涌入了非洲市场。在整个战争时期，美国根据所谓“倒转租借法案”所掠夺的非洲物资即达二亿一千五百万美元，至于用其他方法掠夺的所得，更远远超过这个数目。因此，到战争结束时，美国势力已从多方面渗入非洲大陆；美国国务院官员所宣扬的“贸易方面机会均等的原则”已经在非洲“保持住至高无上的地位”。欧洲的老牌帝国主义国家以及它们的非洲殖民地都一个个的被锁上了美元的锁链。
    美国后来居上
    战后美国殖民势力更大规模地侵入非洲。号称“欧洲复兴计划”的“马歇尔计划”就是美国大规模侵入非洲的一个有力工具。根据“马歇尔计划”规定，“非洲经济发展”的目的，是“加强参加发展计划各国——即西欧殖民国家的——经济“然而，“首先考虑的是非洲人民的利益”。美国的经济合作署、进出口银行以及美国控制下的世界银行，随即在非洲展开了大规模的活动。美国这些机构的活动，一方面为美国国内过剩的工业产品找到了出路；另一方面也为美国私人企业的投资开辟了道路。因此，自1950年以后，美国私人资本便跟踪而进，和美国的各式各样的“援助”“贷款”一起进行了疯狂的殖民扩张。南非和刚果的铀，罗得西亚的铜和钶，中刚果、加蓬和加纳的锰，赤道非洲的钼、锌和铝等重要矿藏，都纷纷被美国资本所控制或渗入。此外，美国在非洲的投资有很大一部分集中在石油勘探和开采方面，估计约占全部投资的三分之一到二分之一。在阿尔及利亚、利比亚、索马里兰、象牙海岸、埃塞俄比亚、突尼斯、莫三鼻给、西属撒哈拉、葡属几内亚、安哥拉、怯尼亚、尼日利亚等地，都可以看到美国石油财团的疯狂活动。其中阿尔及利亚是美国石油财团活动的重点地区。到今天，在广阔富饶的非洲大陆上，大部分地区都在不同程度上受到美国资本直接或间接的控制。目前，仅美国的私人投资估计已达二十亿美元，再加上美“援”、“贷款”等形式的投资，已远远超过欧洲老牌殖民主义国家。
    随着美国投资的扩大，美国在非洲的政治和军事活动也有了显著加强。在北非地区，美国先后在摩洛哥（1950年12月）利比亚（1954年9月）取得了建筑军事基地的权利。在东非，美国和埃塞俄比亚签订了军事协定（1953年5月），由美国训练军队。在厄立特里亚，美国也筑有军用情报基地。对于东非的战略要地怯尼亚，美国也正在虎视眈眈。1954年，美国海军曾访问了这个地区，美国的“共同安全署”以及世界银行都曾提出贷款，用来改善这里的海港设备。美国和南非联邦、利比里亚在1951年11月间先后签订了“共同防务援助协定”。此外，美国对西非其他地区，近年来也积极进行了军事渗入活动。
    旧殖民国家的抵抗
    美国在非洲的殖民扩张，遭到了英法等老牌殖民主义国家的节节抵抗。
    在具有重大战略意义的北非地区，帝国主义之间的斗争特别激烈。在利比亚地区，英国为了抗拒美国的渗入，在1953年破坏了美国—利比亚的军事基地谈判，抢先和利比亚签订了为期二十年的“友好同盟条约”，并且向利比亚提供了一千万美元的贷款。但美国绝不会甘居下风，它经过威逼利诱，终于在1954年取得了建立基地的权利。美国并策动利比亚要求法军退出斐赞省，以便实现其扩大军事基地的阴谋。在摩洛哥基地问题上，美法之间也进行着尖锐的斗争。法国反对摩洛哥单独和美国谈判基地问题，而认为必须由美、法、摩三国共同解决。1957年尼克松访摩洛哥时，法国国内大哗，许多议员甚至要求政府向美国这一“不友好”的行动提出抗议。在突尼斯，美法的矛盾更其尖锐。去年年底，法国空军疯狂轰炸突尼斯的萨基埃特·西迪·优素福村以后，美国立即以“斡旋者”的身份出现，派出了副国务卿帮办墨菲去突尼斯进行活动。去年年底，美国更对突尼斯提出了紧急军事“援助”，英国也采取了同样的措施。这引起了法国政府的极度不满。此外，美国石油垄断财团正在竭力设法侵入阿尔及利亚地区，特别是撒哈拉地区。英、法等国对于美国势力的渗入也极为不安。英国电台早就大声疾呼地警告说，英国绝不能幻想“受美国黄金灌溉的非洲，会长出英国的玫瑰来”。
    在非洲的其他地区，美国势力的扩张，也受到旧殖民国家的抵制和反抗。
    美国的两面手法
    美国一面排挤英法等殖民势力，一面又支持它们，而美国对于旧殖民势力的支持，除为了共同镇压民族独立运动以外，也是为了替美国的独霸创造有利的条件。
    1956年发表的美国众院外交委员会的弗兰西斯·波尔顿报告说：美国在扩大侵略非洲的活动中，“丝毫不愿干预”欧洲殖民国家统治非洲人民的“方式方法”。美国在非洲同在其他地区一样，是一切形式的殖民统治的积极支持者。法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，如果没有美国军事、财政和外交上的支持，是早就无法维持下去了。在罗德西亚和尼亚萨兰，英国成立中非联邦的计划也受到美国的支持。世界银行曾经把“建立一个单一的政治联邦”作为向罗德西亚提供贷款的条件。另外，在托管地前途、种族歧视等问题上，旧殖民主义国家也不止一次在联合国内得到美国的支持。
    但是，这一切都掩盖不了美国夺取旧殖民国家的势力范围的活动。随着非洲民族独立运动的高涨，已经取得独立的国家日益增多，余下的不少殖民地取得独立也为期不远，美国也更加加紧了对非洲的争夺。美国在非洲许多地区已经完全撇开欧洲的老牌帝国主义国家，单独进行活动。
    近一年多来，美国已在西非和中非许多地区设立了外交使馆和美国新闻处。美国的洛克菲勒基金组织和福特基金组织也以所谓“民间机构”的面貌在这些地区展开了大规模的活动。美国的目的无非是在欧洲帝国主义国家的统治机器被打垮以前，先培养起一套代理人集团来，一旦需要，就可以取而代之。这样一个独立国家刚诞生的时候，就将在美国的魔掌下成了名存实亡的死胎。
    对于新独立的非洲国家，美国则以美“援”为饵，加紧进行政治、经济渗透。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿萨脱斯威特在全非人民大会开幕前夕，曾经认为非洲民族独立运动的发展，是对美国的“挑战”。他主张美国“迅速、大方和明智地采取行动”，给予非洲国家以“充分的经济和技术援助”。美国必须“毫不迟延地充分地利用这个机会”。“纽约时报”在评论加纳——尼日利亚结成西非联邦核心、当时，承认美国提供“援助”的目的在于“影响”非洲民族独立国家采取所谓“建设性的行动方针”，以利于美国不断进行殖民扩张。
    非洲人民要做主人
    非洲已经觉醒，非洲人民要做非洲的主人。随着帝国主义的加紧争夺和美国势力的大举侵入，非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争也更加高涨起来。
    非洲人民越来越多地逐步破除了以前对美国的幻想。在“马歇尔计划”推行不久的时候，非洲人民就已经感到了美国是不怀好意的。一位尼日利亚人说：“马歇尔计划是利用非洲资源为欧洲和美国服务的政策。这种政策，就其含意来说，是绝对不利于非洲摆脱欧洲殖民主义、争取自由的事业的”。美国国务院也不得不承认非洲人广泛存在着对“马歇尔计划”的憎恶和敌对情绪。
    此后，在利比亚和摩洛哥的军事基地的问题上，在阿尔及利亚人民争取独立以及苏伊士事件等问题上，非洲人民又进一步认清了美国的狰狞的帝国主义面貌。理查兹在非洲一些国家推销“艾森豪威尔主义”时，在阿联、摩洛哥、苏丹的碰壁，也具有重要意义。
    有二十二个非洲地区和国家代表参加的亚非人民团结大会曾经作出专门的决议谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”和其他帝国主义的侵略行为。大会决议中列举了帝国主义国家对亚非国家的各种侵略形式：例如外国对别国事务的干涉；制造势力范围和签订危害世界和平和压制人民愿望的军事和政治条约和联盟；侵犯国家主权的条约；为了帝国主义而对别国国民经济所进行的剥削；颠复民族政府；在别国领土上建立外国军事基地和驻扎外国军队等。帝国主义这些罪行，正是美国在亚非两洲进行侵略活动最好的写照。
    这次全非人民大会也对帝国主义和殖民主义进行了有力的控诉，并通过了相应的决议。非洲人民掌握自己的命运，把所有帝国主义赶出非洲的日子越来越近了。
