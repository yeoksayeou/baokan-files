    Who Subscribed to the Newspaper?
    Zhejiang Shangyu Ren Shangzhong
    The postman hurriedly stepped into the kitchen of the Ruyi Canteen, dropped a newspaper, and turned to leave. Adebo, who was chopping vegetables, suddenly looked up and asked in surprise, "Shousong, why are you delivering newspapers to us?" "You subscribed!" He said and left.
    Smoke and steam enveloped the narrow kitchen. Four old cooks were busy cooking and preparing food. Uncle Sheng, who was tending the fire, opened his mouth as if asking a question, "Who subscribed to this newspaper? We didn't subscribe!" Uncle Xiang, while pouring rice into the wok, replied, "The postman wouldn't deliver it wrong, the words 'Ruyi Canteen Kitchen' are clearly written on the corner of the newspaper!" Adebo said with confidence, "The team probably subscribed for us." He jokingly added, "You only focus on cooking, let you read the newspaper to open your minds." This caused a burst of laughter. Uncle Kui continued, "Brother De is right! We only cook and don't study, our minds will indeed rust, people will say we're old-fashioned!"
    The canteen was noisy, groups of commune members entered the dining hall for meals while talking and laughing, and the cooks spiritedly delivered food. Even the platoon leader, Xiancan, walked in carrying a hoe. Adebo asked, "Platoon leader, did you subscribe to the newspaper for us?" Xiancan said, "No!"
    In the evening, Adebo went to the postal agency again to ask, "Comrade Ayuo, who subscribed for the newspaper for our Ruyi Canteen kitchen?" Ayuo replied, "Simao from your team subscribed."
    Adebo returned to the village and went straight to Simao's house. Simao and several young men were sitting under the kerosene lamp, talking and laughing. Adebo entered the door and asked, "Simao, how come the newspaper you subscribed to was delivered to the kitchen?" Several people quickly stood up to offer him a seat. Simao replied with a smile, "Uncle Adebo, you are busy day and night cooking for everyone, we have nothing to thank you for, a few brothers discussed it and subscribed to a newspaper for you to read." Adebo listened, and suddenly his whole body warmed up. He said urgently, "How can this be? How can this be? Cooking is just fulfilling a little responsibility for us old folks, contributing a little strength."

    谁订的报？  
    浙江上虞  任尚忠
    邮递员匆匆地跨进如意食堂的炊事房，丢下一张报纸，转身就走。正在切菜的阿德伯，突然抬起头来，惊异地问：“寿松，你怎么替我们送来报纸呢？”“你们订的呀！”说罢就走了。
    青烟、蒸气笼罩着不宽敞的炊事房。四个老炊事员正忙着烧菜煮饭。正在烧火的胜叔公发问似的开了腔：“这报是谁订的呀！我们可没有订嘛！”祥叔一面将米倒进镬里，一面回答着：“邮递员是不会送错的，报角上还清楚的写着‘如意食堂炊事房’的字呢！”阿德伯满有把握地说：“这大概是队里给我们订的。”他还打趣的补上一句：“你们只埋头做饭，给你们看看报，思想开开窍。”引起了一阵哄笑。奎公接着说：“德哥讲得对！我们光烧饭，不学习，思想确实要生锈了，人家要说我们老脑筋了！”
    食堂里乱哄哄的，一簇簇的社员边谈边笑的进餐厅来吃饭，炊事员精神抖擞的送饭搬菜。连长贤灿背着锄头，也走了进来，阿德伯就问：“连长你给我们订了报吗？”贤灿说：“没有呀！”
    傍晚，阿德伯又到邮政代办所去问：“阿幼同志，我们如意食堂炊事房的一份报是谁来订的？”阿幼回答说：“你们队里四毛来订的。”
    阿德伯回到村里，就直向四毛家里走去。四毛和几个小伙子坐在煤油灯下谈笑着，阿德伯进门就问：“四毛，你订的报，怎么送到炊事房来了？”几个人连忙立起来让坐，四毛笑嘻嘻地回答：“阿德伯，你们日夜地忙着为大伙儿烧饭做菜，我们没有什么可以向你们答谢，几个兄弟哥商量了一下，订份报给你们看看。”阿德伯听了，忽然全身热起来，他急急地说：“这怎么行呢？怎么行呢？烧饭做菜也只是尽尽我们老头子的一点责任，贡献一点力量呗。”
