The United Nations General Assembly recently voted on the proposal regarding the Algerian question passed by the Political Committee. As a result, the proposal failed to pass by one vote.

This proposal was put forward by seventeen Asian and African countries. It demanded recognition of the Algerian people's right to independence and advocated resolving the Algerian question through negotiations. The result of the voting reflected the common desire of the Asian and African people to restore peace in Algeria on the basis of recognizing the Algerian people's right to national independence. In this vote, the vast majority of Asian and African countries, and all socialist countries, clearly expressed their support for the Algerian people's struggle for independence and freedom. Those who voted against included many colonial countries, such as Britain, Italy, and Portugal. The United States, which has always proclaimed that all peoples enjoy the right to self-determination, voted against the seventeen-nation Asian-African proposal in the UN General Assembly Political Committee; then, in the General Assembly Plenary Session, it used abstention to support France.

Anyone with a little memory will not forget: As early as September 1955, when the United Nations General Assembly first raised the Algerian question, the United States voted against including this issue on the agenda. US Representative Lodge openly clamored that Algeria was an "inseparable part of the French Republic." Since then, US Ambassador to France Douglas Dillon adopted the tone of the French conquerors, and Washington unconditionally supported the policies implemented by Soustelle (and later Lacoste). At the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1956, the US representative firmly opposed the seventeen-nation Asian-African proposal to recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination. In the discussions from November to December 1957, the United States supported the deceptive Algerian "Basic Law" put forward by France at the time. ... In fact, the United States not only tried its best to defend France's colonialist policy and obstruct a reasonable solution to the Algerian question at the previous UN General Assembly discussions on the Algerian issue, but also provided France with a large amount of military supplies through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement; it used hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and "aid" to make up for the huge financial deficit caused by France's Algerian war expenditures. Therefore, despite the United States' best efforts to conceal its colonialist stance on the Algerian issue by various means, its words and actions are constantly exposing itself.

As one of the parties involved in the Algerian issue, France refused to attend the meeting during the UN discussion of this issue to avoid the accusations of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and the condemnation of world opinion. This unreasonable attitude once again showed that French colonialists still vainly attempted to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement by force and permanently occupy Algeria. The fact is also true, the de Gaulle government, which climbed to power relying on the military coup in Algeria, continued to mobilize colonial troops to carry out bloody suppression of the Algerian people. De Gaulle made it clear that there were only two futures for Algeria: "Either war or fraternal love." That is to say, Algeria is either forcibly annexed by the French colonialists, or it is recruited by France. Obviously, the French government's attempt to destroy the Algerian people's will to demand independence is completely contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Algerian people, like the people of other countries, have the right to self-determination and have the right to democracy, independence, and freedom. The United Nations has the responsibility to stop the colonial war waged by France in Algeria, and to promote a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question on the basis of confirming the Algerian nation's right to independence.

Although the United Nations General Assembly failed to adopt a plan for the peaceful settlement of the Algerian issue in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of countries and peoples this time due to the deliberate obstruction of the United States and other colonial countries. However, the Algerian people's struggle for independence and freedom will not be affected by this in any way. On the contrary, the Algerian people, and even the entire African people, can see from the voting situation in the United Nations who are the supporters of the national independence movement, who are the opponents of the national independence movement, who are the friends of the Algerian and African people, and who are the enemies of the Algerian and African people. We are convinced that no matter whether the United Nations General Assembly passes a resolution that conforms to the Algerian people's desire for independence, as long as the Algerian people unite as one, persevere, and persist in their struggle, they will surely overthrow the colonial rule of imperialism and achieve final victory!

    必须确认阿尔及利亚的独立权利
    本报评论员
    联合国大会全体会议最近就政治委员会通过的关于阿尔及利亚问题的提案进行表决。结果由于一票之差，这个提案没有通过。
    这个提案是由亚非十七个国家提出的。要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，并且主张通过谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题。投票表决的结果反映出亚非人民争取在承认阿尔及利亚人民民族独立权利的基础上，恢复阿尔及利亚的和平的共同愿望。在这次投票中，绝大多数的亚非国家和所有的社会主义国家，都明白表示了自己支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立和自由的立场。投反对票的包括许多殖民国家，例如英国、意大利和葡萄牙等。而一向宣扬各国人民享有自决权利的美国，这次在联大政治委员会就亚非十七国提案进行表决时，投的是反对票；到联大全体会议上又用弃权的办法来支持法国。
    稍有记性的人都不会忘记：早在1955年9月，联合国大会第一次提出阿尔及利亚问题的时候，美国投票反对把这个问题列入议程。美国代表洛奇公开叫嚷阿尔及利亚是“法兰西共和国不可分割的部分”。这以后，美国驻法大使道格拉斯·狄龙采用了法国征服者的论调，华盛顿无条件支持苏斯戴尔（和后来的拉戈斯特）所执行的政策。在1956年联合国第十一届大会上，美国代表坚决反对承认阿尔及利亚人民享有自决权的亚非十七国提案。在1957年11月到12月的讨论中，美国又为法国当时提出的骗人的阿尔及利亚“根本法”捧场。……事实上，美国不仅是在历次联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题的时候，极力为法国的殖民主义政策辩解，阻挠阿尔及利亚问题的合理解决，它还通过北大西洋公约组织为法国提供大量的军事物资，来镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动；以几亿美元的贷款和“援助”来弥补法国由于阿尔及利亚战争开支而造成的巨大财政赤字。因此，尽管美国竭力用种种办法掩饰它对阿尔及利亚问题所采取的殖民主义立场，它的言论和行动却总是在不断地揭露着自己。
    作为阿尔及利亚问题的当事国之一的法国，在联大关于这一问题的讨论中，以拒不参加会议来逃避阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表的控诉和世界舆论的谴责。它这种无理的态度又一次表明了：法国殖民主义者仍然妄想用武力镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动、永远霸占阿尔及利亚。事实也正是如此，依靠阿尔及利亚的军事政变爬上台的戴高乐政府，继续调动殖民军对阿尔及利亚人民进行血腥镇压。戴高乐明白指出，阿尔及利亚的前途只有两个：“要末是战争，要末是兄弟友爱”。也就是说，阿尔及利亚不是由法国殖民者武力吞并，就是受法国招安。显然，法国政府这种企图摧毁阿尔及利亚人民要求独立的意志的做法，同联合国宪章的宗旨和原则是完全违反的。阿尔及利亚人民，像其他各国人民一样有权自决，有权得到民主、独立和自由。联合国有责任来制止法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，并且促使阿尔及利亚问题能够在确认阿尔及利亚民族独立的权利的基础上得到和平解决。
    这一次联合国大会，虽然由于美国和其他殖民国家的蓄意阻挠，没有能按照绝大多数国家和人民的愿望，通过关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的方案。但是，阿尔及利亚人民争取独立和自由的斗争决不会因此而受到任何影响。恰恰相反，阿尔及利亚人民以至整个非洲人民，可以从联合国投票的情况看出，究竟谁是民族独立运动的支持者，谁是民族独立运动的反对者，谁是阿尔及利亚和非洲人民的朋友，谁是阿尔及利亚和非洲人民的敌人。我们确信，不论联合国大会是否通过符合阿尔及利亚人民独立愿望的决议，只要阿尔及利亚人民团结一致、再接再厉、坚持斗争，就一定能够推翻帝国主义的殖民统治，取得最后胜利！
