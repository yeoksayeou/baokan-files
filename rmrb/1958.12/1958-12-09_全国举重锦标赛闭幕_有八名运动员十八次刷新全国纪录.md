Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 8th. The 1958 National Weightlifting Championships, which lasted a week, victoriously closed at 9:00 PM on the 7th in Xi'an. In all the competitions, Chen Yongbo, Zhu Hongquan, Shu Gang, Huang Qianghui, Li Baiyu, Wang Lijun, Chang Guanqun, and Han Laixiang, eight athletes in the featherweight, middleweight, light-heavyweight, and heavyweight categories, broke national records eighteen times in ten individual events and three total scores; Peng Guofu and Han Laixiang's total scores in the middleweight and heavyweight categories exceeded the standard for Master of Sports, and the individual scores of twelve other athletes reached the Master of Sports standard. The top six teams in the general team score for the ordinary group were Shanghai, Jiangsu, Tianjin, the "August 1st" team of the People's Liberation Army, Fujian, and Beijing.

The middleweight, light-heavyweight, light-heavyweight, and heavyweight events are relatively weak in China's weightlifting sport, but the results of these weightlifting events at this Games were quite excellent. Li Baiyu of the Sichuan team broke the national record of 415 kg with a total score of 432.5 kg in the light-heavyweight competition. Han Laixiang of the "August 1st" team and Chang Guanqun of the Shanghai team broke the national record of 377.5 kg with total scores of 395 kg and 392.5 kg respectively in the heavyweight competition. At this Games, the Chinese Youth Team also defeated the Polish Republic Central Council of Trade Unions weightlifting team with a score of 5-2.

Three hundred and thirty-three athletes from twenty-seven provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and the People's Liberation Army, totaling twenty-eight teams, participated in this Games. The vast majority of them are workers and students. Among the twenty-six athletes from the Tianjin and Jilin teams, there were twenty worker athletes, and the majority of all athletes were novices. Among the forty-three athletes from Anhui, Henan, and Sichuan, thirty-eight were weightlifting athletes who had only appeared in the past year. The more than one hundred and ninety athletes participating in the youth group competition were all young people aged eighteen to twenty-two. This group of new forces can all study diligently and practice hard, so many people created excellent results at this Games. For example, Feng Baoshan, a nineteen-year-old from the Liaoning team, only started practicing weightlifting in the summer, but at this Games, he achieved the standard of a first-class athlete in the flyweight category with a total score of 252.5 kg.

    全国举重锦标赛闭幕
    有八名运动员十八次刷新全国纪录
    新华社西安8日电  历时一周的1958年全国举重锦标赛，于7日晚九时在西安胜利闭幕。全部比赛中有陈永博、朱鸿全、舒刚、黄强辉、李白玉、王立钧、常冠群、韩来祥等。八名运动员在次轻量、中量、次重、重量四个级的十个单项成绩和三个总成绩中，十八次刷新了全国纪录；彭国富、韩来祥的中量级和重量级总成绩都超过了运动健将的标准，另十二名运动员的单项成绩都达到了健将标准。普通组团体总分名列前六名的是上海、江苏、天津、解放军“八一”队、福建、北京等六个队。
    中量、轻重、次重、重量这四个项目，在我国举重运动中都是较为薄弱的项目，而这次运动会上的这几项举重的成绩都颇为优异。四川队李白玉在次重量级比赛中以四百三十二点五公斤的总成绩打破了四百一十五公斤的全国纪录，“八一”队韩来祥和上海队常冠群在重量级比赛分别以三百九十五公斤、三百九十二点五公斤的总成绩打破了三百七十七点五公斤的全国纪录。在这次运动会上中国青年队还以五比二胜波兰共和国总工会中央理事会举重队。
    参加这次运动会的有全国二十七个省、市、自治区和解放军共二十八个队的三百三十三名运动员。其中绝大部分都是工人和学生。天津和吉林两个队二十六个运动员中就有二十个工人运动员，全部运动员中大部分是新手。安徽、河南、四川三个队共四十三名运动员，其中也有三十八个运动员是最近一年来才出现的举重运动员。参加青年组比赛的一百九十多名运动员，都是十八岁到二十二岁的青年。这批新生力量大都能勤学苦练，因此在这次运动会上许多人都创造了优异成绩。如辽宁队十九岁的冯宝山夏天才开始练习举重，而这次在最轻量级比赛中却以二百五十二点五公斤的总成绩，达到了最轻量级一级运动员的标准。
