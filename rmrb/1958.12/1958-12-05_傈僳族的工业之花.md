The Industrial Flower of the Lisu Ethnic Group
By our reporter Huang Changlu

The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, relying on the self-reliance of the various ethnic groups, has vigorously developed local industry, causing the remote and isolated mountainous areas to bloom with industrial flowers.

Before this year, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture was a blank sheet of paper in terms of industry. Although the Gaoligong Mountains and the Biluo Snow Mountains are rich in mineral resources, the Lisu, Nu, Dulong and other ethnic groups living in the mountainous areas have never developed their own industry, and even handicrafts have not yet been separated from agriculture. Farmers of all ethnic groups generally use wooden hoes made of branches or directly use wooden sticks for cultivation. The clothes worn by the masses and the quilts they use are all made of hand-woven hemp cloth; they eat with wooden bowls and cook rice in bamboo tubes. In 1953, four technicians were invited from the interior to open the first small iron factory in Fugong, which began to produce small iron hoes weighing less than half a kilogram. By 1956, only fourteen small factories and mines had been built throughout the prefecture, with fewer than 450 employees. Now, in less than a year, 612 factories and mines, 130 steelmaking furnaces and 150 ironmaking furnaces have been built along the Nujiang River, and 10,000 ethnic minority farmers have learned new technologies such as steelmaking, ironmaking, mining, construction, and forging, becoming the first generation of workers in Nujiang.

The birth of industry has caused tremendous and profound changes in the production and life of various ethnic groups in Nujiang. In the past few years, the government has used manpower and horses to transport large quantities of iron farm tools from thousands of miles away, gradually replacing wooden hoes and wooden sticks. This year, the prefecture has produced 70 tons of steel and 250 tons of iron. The autonomous prefecture is more than self-sufficient in iron and steel. Using these iron and steel, the prefecture has produced 80,000 iron farm tools, including more than 60 new types of farm tools that have appeared in the Nujiang area for the first time, such as deep plows, mountain plows, harvesters, threshers and seeders. Farmers of all ethnic groups are gradually realizing the semi-mechanization of cultivation and harvesting on the basis of popularizing iron farm tools. The improvement of farm tools has made the backward productivity of these ethnic groups advance as fast as a rocket. In the past, threshing was done by foot, and each person could only thresh dozens of kilograms of grain a day, bleeding from their feet. This year, threshers have been widely used, and each person can thresh 350 kilograms of grain a day while singing mountain songs, greatly reducing labor intensity. In the past, Lisu women spent the whole year walking and working by twisting hemp thread, and there was also a special "hemp weaving month" in winter. Now, the autonomous prefecture has established a rayon factory and has begun to weave its own cotton cloth and fine cloth. Bamboo tubes and wooden bowls in the homes of farmers of all ethnic groups have gradually been replaced by iron pots and porcelain bowls. This year, the autonomous prefecture also mined nearly 1,000 tons of industrial raw materials such as mica and crystal, supporting national construction and increasing the income of the masses.

The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture started its industry from scratch, and encountered more difficulties than any other place. However, the Party committees at all levels fully mobilized the masses, turning the development of industry into an urgent requirement and unanimous action of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, and all difficulties were solved. Although Nujiang is rich in mineral resources, where are they buried? No one in the prefecture can answer this mystery. Therefore, the cadres carried their luggage, carried mineral specimens, crossed ropeways, climbed mountains, and publicized the importance of developing industry and the methods of identifying minerals to the masses in villages and villages. After the masses realized the benefits of developing industry to the country and to their own vital interests, they launched a nationwide upsurge in finding and reporting minerals. When they found something different from ordinary stones when hunting and farming in the mountains, they sent them to the cadres overnight to see. The strength of hundreds of thousands of people has surpassed that of geological experts. They have found more than ten kinds of ores such as gold, iron, copper, lead, silver, crystal, and mica in the Biluo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain. The Waping Iron Mine in the Fifth District of Bijiang County was discovered by Hei Qianzhe, a Lisu farmer, while plowing; the villagers of Ganabo Village in the Second District of Gongshan County found a mica mine, which has now mined nearly 700 tons of mica. Nujiang is currently not accessible by road, and machines from the interior cannot be transported in, so they mobilized the masses to build equipment locally. More than 200 steelmaking furnaces and ironmaking furnaces are mostly built near the mines. They found some refractory stones to build furnaces, burned some charcoal, used a few old door panels as bellows, and built a thatched shed to produce. Perhaps the most difficult thing in developing industry is the technical problem. Among the 600 factories and mines in the Nujiang Autonomous Prefecture, there is not a single engineer or technician. This year, they successively sent 400 ethnic minority farmers to factories and mines in the interior to visit and study, and they started working when they came back. The wisdom of the masses broke through the fortress of technology. Taking steelmaking as an example, the workers had never even visited before, but the Party organization in the Nujiang area believed that the masses could make steel, so it assigned this task to the ironmaking plant in the Fourth District of Fugong County. The workers failed three times in their experiments, and finally used a chicken coop furnace to produce the first batch of steel with a quality comparable to foreign steel. Now, there are already 1,500 ethnic minority workers in the prefecture who have mastered steelmaking technology.

On the basis of the successful development of industry by relying on "small local groups," the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee has planned to continue to rely on the masses to develop "small foreign groups" of industry, and plans to produce 1,000 tons of iron and steel next year and build a machine manufacturing factory. Each county, district, and people's commune will build small machine manufacturing or repair plants. A hydropower station will be built to experiment with using electricity to make steel and solve the problem of coal shortage in the territory. And according to the rich resources of the prefecture, industries such as sugar refining, pharmaceutical manufacturing, textile, paper making, flour and non-staple food processing will be established, and efforts will be made to transfer industrial technology to a new basis in two or three years.

    傈僳族的工业之花
    本报记者  黄昌禄
    云南怒江傈僳族自治州依靠各族群众自力更生大办地方工业，使偏远闭塞的山区盛开工业之花。
    今年以前，怒江傈僳族自治州在工业上还是一张白纸。虽然高黎贡山和碧罗雪山里埋藏着丰富的矿产，但居住在山区的傈僳族、怒族、独龙等民族，却一直没有产生自己的工业，甚至手工业也还没有从农业中分离出来，各族农民普遍使用树枝作成的木锄或直接用木棒耕种。群众穿的衣服，盖的被子全部是用手工织的麻布做成的；吃饭用木碗，煮饭用竹筒。1953年，从内地请来了四个技术工人，在福贡开办了第一座小型铁工厂，开始生产不到半斤重的小铁锄。到1956年，全州也不过建成了十四个小厂矿，职工不到四百五十人。现在，不满一年的时间，怒江两岸星罗棋布地建成了六百十二个厂矿，一百三十座炼钢炉和一百五十座炼铁炉，一万名少数民族农民学会了炼钢、炼铁、采矿、建筑、锻铸等新技术，成为怒江第一代工人。
    工业的诞生，在怒江各民族的生产生活中引起了巨大深刻的变化。过去几年，政府曾利用人背马驮千里迢迢地运来了大批铁制农具，逐步代替了木锄木棒。今年，全州已炼出七十吨钢和二百五十吨铁。自治州所需钢铁已自给有余。利用这些钢铁，全州已造出八万件铁制农具，其中包括六十多种在怒江地区第一次出现的新农具，如深犁、山地犁、收割机、打谷机和播种机等。各族农民正在普及铁制农具的基础上，逐步实现耕作收割的半机械化。农具的改进使这些民族落后的生产力像火箭一样飞快前进。过去打谷用脚踩，每人每天踩得脚板流血也只能打谷几十斤，今年普遍使用了打谷机，每人每天唱着山歌就可打谷三百五十斤，大大减轻了劳动强度。以前傈僳族妇女一年到头走路干活都在搓麻线，冬天还有一个月专门的“织麻布月”。现在，自治州建立了人造棉工厂，开始自己织造棉布和细布。各族农民家庭中的竹筒木碗已逐渐被铁锅瓷碗所代替。今年，自治州还开采了近千吨云母、水晶等工业原料，支援了国家建设，增加了群众收入。
    怒江傈僳族自治州办工业是道地的白手起家，碰到的困难比其它任何地方都多。但各级党委充分发动了群众，把办工业变成全州各族人民的迫切要求和一致行动，所有困难都迎刃而解。虽说怒江矿产丰富，但它们究竟埋藏在哪里？全州没有人来解答这个谜。于是，干部们就背起行李，带着矿石标本过溜索翻大山，逐村逐寨向群众宣传办工业的重要意义及识矿方法，群众认识了办工业对国家的好处和对他们的切身利益以后，便掀起了全民找矿报矿的热潮。他们在山上打猎耕地时发现与一般石头不一样的，便星夜送去找干部看。几十万群众的力量，赛过了地质专家，他们已在碧罗雪山和高黎贡山上找到金、铁、铜、铅、银、水晶、云母等十余种矿石。碧江县第五区的娃平铁矿，是傈僳族农民黑前者在犁地时发现的；贡山县第二区戛那博村群众找到一个云母矿，现已开采了将近七百吨云母。怒江目前还不通公路，内地有机器也运不进来，他们就发动群众就地取材造设备。两百多个炼钢炉和炼铁炉大都建在矿边，找点耐火石砌成炉子，烧些木炭，用几块旧门板作个风箱，搭间草棚就生产了。也许办工业中最困难的还是技术问题，怒江自治州的六百多座厂矿中，没有一个工程师或技术员。他们今年先后派了四百个少数民族农民到内地厂矿参观学习，回来便干开了。群众的智慧攻破了技术的堡垒。以炼钢为例，工人们连参观也没有参观过，但怒江地区的党组织相信群众能炼出钢来，就把这任务交给福贡县第四区的炼铁厂。工人三次试验都失败了，最后终于用鸡窝炉炼出了第一炉质量可以同洋钢媲美的钢。现在，全州已经有一千五百名少数民族工人掌握了炼钢技术。
    在依靠“小土群”办工业获得成功的基础上，自治州党委已经规划继续依靠群众办“小洋群”的工业了，准备明年生产一千吨钢铁，建设一座机械制造厂。各县、区和人民公社分别建设小型机械制造或修配厂。建设一座水力发电站，试验用电力炼钢，解决境内缺煤的困难。并根据本州的丰富资源，建立榨糖、制药、纺织、造纸、面粉及副食品加工等工业，争取在两三年内把工业技术转到新的基础上。
