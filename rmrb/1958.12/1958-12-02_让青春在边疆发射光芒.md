    Let Youth Shine on the Frontier
    By our reporters Zhao Qi and Ge Lai
    Some people, when they hear the word "frontier," immediately think of ice and snow, wind and sand, the vast desert, and camel caravans, as if it were desolate and frightening. They do not understand that the frontier today is full of new meaning, a symbol of courage, diligence, and glory. The frontier is a place of grand construction projects and a vibrant life. In the past two or three years, tens of thousands of outstanding young men and women have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, heading to the motherland's frontier to "extract treasures from barren mountains and offer grain from the grasslands," determined to join hands with people of all ethnic minorities to fight against nature and turn the frontier into a beautiful and happy garden of the motherland.
    How can we describe the vibrant life of the frontier builders? Perhaps it is difficult to imagine: a prospector's tent village springs up overnight at the foot of a snowy mountain. Logging teams enter the primeval forest, alarming beasts that have dwelled there for thousands of years. Vast grasslands, where no house has ever stood, miraculously give rise to new towns. Wilderness that was uninhabited last year yields millions of mu of fertile land this year. In high-altitude areas around 4,000 meters above sea level, all kinds of crops and vegetables grow. Highways replace ancient post roads, and the horns of truck convoys echo through the valleys. The frontier representatives who came to participate in the Second National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists are all so radiant as they talk about the moving scenes of frontier construction. Wang Shulan, a young woman from Shanghai, was captivated by the small red flags fluttering all over the Qaidam Basin as soon as she stepped foot there. She discovered that there were more and more drilling rigs for oil exploration, and at night, lights were lit in tent clusters everywhere. She could not contain her excitement: "What a wonderful place! I have come to the motherland's treasure bowl." Wang Shulan is a mail clerk at the Lenghu Post and Telecommunications Bureau in the basin. What moves this young person the most is the selfless spirit of labor of the basin builders. She saw oil workers guarding the oil wells day and night, their bodies covered with ice. She saw Liang Zhigang, the director of the post and telecommunications bureau and secretary of the Party branch, often carrying mailbags himself to deliver mail. The director, fearing that the young people would catch a cold, gave the mobile house to the young people to live in, while he slept in a drafty yurt, his quilt covered with a thick layer of snow after a night of wind and snow. She saw the joyful scene of people in the basin passing on the good news about oil discoveries, and the post and telecommunications bureau was often visited by oil workers to report good news. "Here, it feels so shameful to care about personal gains and losses; everyone is working for a common ideal!" Wang Shulan said, "I increasingly understand that people don't live just to eat and wear clothes, but to live a more meaningful life." The girl has become strong. In her work, even in the severe cold of minus 30 or 40 degrees Celsius, she helps unload mailbags as soon as the mail truck arrives at night, allowing the drivers and escorts to warm themselves by the fire in the tent. She travels 70 to 100 kilometers to the tents of field teams and the road maintenance stations along the highway to carry out mobile services, and also takes the opportunity to promote the significance of subscribing to newspapers and magazines to the workers on stage during thousand-person gatherings and movie nights. One night, she received more than 300 subscriptions to newspapers and magazines in two hours. Now the distribution density here has reached two magazines subscribed per person, and an average of more than one newspaper subscribed per person. Wang Shulan said: "People here are doing all kinds of work, but we all understand the meaning of our work. We are all the first developers of the basin!"
    The young people from the interior who support the construction of the frontier have fallen in love with the land irrigated by their sweat with such deep feelings, and are determined to take root and blossom in their new home. A land reclamation team composed of 449 young people from Henan established the Chahanwusu Youth Collective Farm in Qinghai. This farm is only three years old. In the first year that the land reclamation team came, it was all wilderness, and their food and clothing were all provided by the state. Last year, they achieved self-sufficiency. But this year, they harvested 1.25 million jin of grain all at once. The area around the farm is full of treasures. They found copper, iron, zinc, lead, and crystal, and established eight factories for smelting, artificial fibers, sugar making, leather, clothing, repair, and food processing. They are also planning to build "Communist Youth City." The young people have brought their parents from their hometowns in Henan, and their younger siblings. More than 50 young couples held their weddings on the same day. Dozens of chubby babies appeared on the farm, one of whom was named "Wei Frontier." The father of this child, Wei Fushen, is the secretary of the farm's Party general branch and a first-class labor model in the 1956 land reclamation movement. When Wei Fushen was a child, he and his parents wandered around Henan begging for food, his father starved to death, and his brother was conscripted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The family was scattered. It was not until after liberation that Wei Fushen met his mother and younger brother. Wei Fushen said: "Thinking about the past and looking at today, as long as the Party calls, how can I not work resolutely!" In 1956, Wei Fushen and his wife were the first to register in the district, responding to the Party's call to go to the frontier. Now, Wei Fushen's family has reunited in Qinghai.
    Vice Chairman Zhu De called on young people to go to the Northwest and Inner Mongolia and other regions to accelerate the construction of the motherland's frontier and to show their skills in the great socialist construction there. Go to the frontier, go to the place where the motherland needs you most! More and more young men and women are emitting light and heat in frontier construction. Some people did not fully understand the significance of supporting frontier construction at first, but when they set foot on the land of the frontier, their mood changed, and they sincerely hoped to change the face of the frontier immediately. Wang Fengchang, a young welding worker who came to Baotou Steel in February of this year, saw that the wooden-wheeled carts in Inner Mongolia were too clumsy, so he said to the secretary of the Party branch: "It would be great if these carts could be modified." The branch secretary said: "We are building factories here to solve such problems. With steel, anything is possible!" Wang Fengchang understood for the first time the significance of establishing industries in minority areas. He thought, Baotou Steel needs to speed up construction, what more can he do? It was this installation worker, who had never made machinery, who, together with his young partners, worked day and night in the technical innovation movement. With the help of veteran workers, they created miracles, manufacturing a hand-operated grinder, an acetylene generator, an automatic shrinking machine, an automated rolling bed, and eight other automated machines, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. Wang Fengchang said: "Everyone who works here feels happy. Look, the new factory buildings are emerging from the beaches. A few months ago, everyone was still fighting groundhogs there, and now the big chimneys are standing up."
    Let us introduce another Communist Party member who is "Red in Tibet and specialized in Tibet"! He is Tan Changhua, a young technician at the Rikaze Farm. He often participates in land reclamation production, livestock breeding, and cultivation of new varieties of crops that do not exist on the plateau. He has learned the Tibetan language and often carries his luggage to rural areas and pastures to learn from the production experience of the Tibetan people and study the changes in the soil and climate of Tibet. In recent years, Tan Changhua's farm has successfully tested more than 300 varieties of highland barley, wheat, and vegetables. When he saw that most agricultural areas in Tibet only grow one crop a year, and many pastoral areas lack grass in winter, he began to study diligently and conduct bold experiments. This year, he successfully tested a single-season double-cropping of highland barley and "Xuesha" pasture in a mu of experimental field. Many Tibetans often come to visit his experimental field and offer him white hadas to express their congratulations.
    The new generation nurtured by the Party has shown noble communist qualities in frontier construction, selflessly dedicating their precious youth and everything they have.
    During a season of heavy snow, a logging team with mountain axes, large saws, and mountain-splitting explosives entered the Nanshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. One dark night of howling wind, a fire suddenly broke out at the logging site, and the entire site was instantly engulfed in a sea of flames. The flames engulfed the workers' sheds, and the explosives exploded with thunderous roars. Seeing that the timber was about to be burned, Li Sanlu, a young Communist Party member who had been participating in construction in Xinjiang for nearly ten years, was also covered with sparks, but when he thought of the motherland's construction and that Xinjiang's infrastructure projects were urgently awaiting timber, he jumped into the fire without hesitation, repeatedly rescuing timber and workers trapped in the fire. At this time, Li Sanlu's hands and legs were bleeding from the fire, causing him unbearable pain, but when he discovered that there were still several boxes of explosives in the fire, he straightened up and rushed into the fire again, continuously carrying out several boxes, until the last time he rushed out of the raging fire dozens of feet high, he fainted in a loud noise. When rescuers found him, Li Sanlu had already frozen on the snow, still holding the box in both hands, constantly shouting: "Timber!" "Timber!"
    Young people have received the best training in frontier construction. Chen Naiyu, a young man from Shanghai who participated in construction in Ningxia, was praised by the local people for his spirit of self-sacrifice when he participated in water conservancy construction in Jingyuan County. After Chen Naiyu arrived in Jingyuan County, he heard that millions of mu of land here were suffering from drought. Seeing that Ma Sizhi, the secretary of the Jingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally climbed the mountains to find a water diversion route, he asked to do water conservancy work with excitement. His legitimate request was supported by the Party, and he quickly learned some water conservancy and surveying techniques. In the battle to conquer Laolongtan, he and the young people of the commando team swore in the face of the cliffs of the Laolongtan Canyon: "In order to quench the thirst of millions of mu of land, for the construction of the motherland's frontier, we will overcome all difficulties and be sure to divert water up the mountain." This project was very dangerous. The cliffs of Laolongtan Canyon towered into the clouds. In the past, some people had tried to explore a water diversion channel and fell to their deaths beneath the cliffs. In order to explore the channel, Chen Naiyu and his partners risked their lives, sliding from the hanging rocks to the cliffs, suspending themselves in the air to survey, and finally measured the channel.
    These outstanding young people all attended the Second National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists. In the glorious and magnificent cause of frontier construction, their youth has radiated brilliant light.

    让青春在边疆发射光芒
    本报记者  赵奇  格来
    有些人一听到“边疆”，就联想到冰雪、风沙，想到浩瀚的沙漠和骆驼群，似乎十分荒凉可怕。他们不了解，现在的边疆，却已经充满了崭新的涵义，它是勇敢、勤劳、光荣的象征。在边疆，到处是规模宏伟的建设，到处是沸腾的生活。近两三年来，已有成千成万的优秀青年男女，热情地响应了党的号召，他们怀着崇高的理想，奔向祖国边疆“向荒山取宝，要草原献粮”，立志要和各少数民族人民并肩向大自然开战，把边疆变成祖国幸福美丽的花园。
    怎样来介绍边疆建设者的沸腾生活啊？也许你很难想像得到；雪山下面，一个晚上就出现了探矿者的帐篷村。伐木队开进遮天的原始森林，惊走了伏居千年的野兽。从来没有一座房屋的辽阔草原，像奇迹似的突然出现了新的城镇。去年还是没有人烟的荒野，今年就开出良田千万亩。拔海四千公尺左右的高寒地带，长出了各种各样的作物和蔬菜。公路代替了古驿道，汽车队的喇叭在山谷里欢鸣。前来参加第二次全国青年建设社会主义积极分子大会的边疆代表们，个个都是那么神采奕奕地谈起建设边疆的动人情景。上海姑娘王淑兰一踏进柴达木盆地，就被遍地飘着的小红旗吸引住了，她发现钻探石油的井架越来越多，夜里，一处处的帐篷群里燃起了灯火。她禁不住内心的激动：“这是个多么好的地方！我来到了祖国的聚宝盆。”王淑兰是盆地冷湖邮电局的封发员，最使这个青年人感动的，是盆地建设者们忘我的劳动精神。她看到石油工人日夜守候在油井旁边，浑身上下结满了冰凌。她看到邮电局长、党支部书记梁志刚经常自己背着邮包到外面送信，局长怕青年人着了凉，把活动房子让给青年们住，自己睡进透顶的蒙古包，一夜风雪，睡的被子铺满了一层厚雪。她看到盆地的人们互相传送石油喜报的狂欢情景，连邮电局也经常有石油工人们来报喜。“在这里，觉得计较个人得失是多么可耻，人人都在为着共同的理想啊！”王淑兰说，“我越来越懂得，人活着不光是为了吃和穿，是要怎样生活得更有意义。”姑娘变得坚强了，在工作中，那怕是零下三、四十度的严寒天气，夜里邮车一到，就去帮着卸邮包，让驾驶员和押运员到帐篷烤火。她跑出七十到一百公里以外，到野外队的帐篷和沿公路的道班房去开展流动业务，还乘举行千人集会和电影晚会的机会，到台上向职工们宣传订阅报刊的意义。有一天晚上，她在两个小时内就收订了三百多份报刊。现在这里的发行密度，达到每一个人订了两份杂志，平均一个多人就订了一份报纸。王淑兰说：“这里的人做着各种各样的工作，但是我们都了解自己工作的意义，我们都是盆地的第一批开采人！”
    支援边疆建设的内地青年，就是怀着这样深切的感情，爱上了自己用汗珠灌溉过的土地，决心在新的家乡生根开花。由四百四十九个河南青年组成的垦荒队，在青海建立了察汉乌苏青年集体农庄。这个农庄只有三年历史，垦荒队刚来的那年，荒野一片，他们的吃穿全由国家负担。去年，做到了自给。但是今年，一下就收了粮食一百二十五万斤。农庄的周围，遍地是宝，他们找到了铜、铁、锌、铅和水晶，建立了冶炼、人造纤维、制糖、皮革、被服、修配、食品加工等八个工厂，他们还正在筹建“共青城”。青年们把在河南家乡的爸爸妈妈接来了，把弟弟妹妹接来了，五十多对青年男女在一天同时举行了婚礼，农庄出现了几十个胖娃娃，其中有一个名字叫做“魏边疆”。这个孩子的爸爸魏富申，是农庄的党总支书记、1956年开荒运动的一等劳动模范。魏富申小时候在河南和爸爸妈妈一起到处逃荒讨饭，父亲活活饿死了，哥哥被国民党反动派拉壮丁拉走，一家人东离西散。直到解放后，魏富申才和母亲、弟弟见了面。魏富申说：“想过去，看今天，只要党有号召，我怎能干得不坚决！”1956年，魏富申和他的爱人首先到区里报名，响应党提出的到边疆去的号召。现在，魏富申的一家又在青海团聚了。
    朱德副主席号召青年们到西北和内蒙古等地区去，加速祖国边疆的建设，在那里的伟大社会主义建设中大显身手。到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去！越来越多的青年男女在边疆建设中，发出了光和热。有些人，一开始还没有完全明白支援边疆建设的意义，但是当他们踏上了边疆的土地，心情变了，真是一个劲儿的希望马上就把边疆的面貌改变过来。今年2月才到包钢的青年电焊工人王凤昌，看到内蒙古的木轱辘大车太笨，便向党支部书记说：“如果把这种大车改装一下，那该多好。”支部书记说：“我们在这里办工厂，就是为了要解决这样的问题，有了钢铁，什么事都好办了！”王凤昌第一次懂得了在少数民族地区办工业的意义，他想，包钢需要加快建设，自己能够更多地做些什么呢？就是这个从来没有制造过机械的安装工人，和青年伙伴一起，在技术革新运动中日夜苦战，在老工人的帮助下，连创奇迹，他们制造出手搬式磨床、乙炔发生器、自动缩口机、自动化滚床和其他八台自动化机械，大大加快了工程进展的速度。王凤昌说：“在这里工作的人，谁不觉得幸福，你看，新的厂房都是从沙滩里冒出来的。几个月前，大伙还在那里打地老鼠，现在大烟囱都竖起来了。”
    让我们再介绍一个“红在西藏、专在西藏”的共产党员吧！他就是日喀则农场的青年技术员谭昌华。他经常参加开荒生产、饲养牲畜、培植高原上没有的新品种农作物，他学会了藏语，时常背着行李，到农村、牧场学习藏族人民的生产经验，研究西藏土壤和气候的变化。谭昌华所在的农场，几年来已试种成功了三百多种青稞、小麦和蔬菜。当他看到西藏大部分农区每年只种一季作物，许多牧区冬季缺草的时候，就开始了苦心钻研，进行大胆的试验，今年，他在一亩试验田里，试种成功了一季连作、一季两收的青稞和“雪沙”牧草。许多藏民经常到他的试验田来参观，向他献洁白的哈达表示祝贺。
    党所教养出来的新一代，在边疆建设中表现出了崇高的共产主义品质，他们毫不保留地献出了珍贵的青春，献出了自己的一切。
    在大风雪的季节里，一支伐木队带着山斧、大锯和劈山的炸药，开进了新疆维吾尔自治区的南山。一个狂风吼啸的黑夜，伐木工地突然起了大火，霎时整个工地成了一片火海，火舌卷进了工棚，炸药雷鸣般地爆炸着，眼看木材就要烧坏了，在新疆参加建设近十年的年青的共产党员李三禄，身上也冒起火星，但他一想到祖国的建设，想到新疆的基建工程正迫切地等待着木料，他就毫不犹豫地跳进大火里，一次又一次地抢救木料和被困在火圈的工人。这时，李三禄的手上、腿上已被火烧得鲜血直流，使他痛得直不起腰来，但他一发现火圈里还有几箱炸药，就猛地伸起腰来，又冲进火海，接连搬出了几箱，直到最后一次他从数十丈高的烈火中冲出来时，就在一声巨响中昏过去了，当救护人员发现时，李三禄已冻僵在雪地上，他两手还抱着箱子，嘴里不断地喊着：“木料！”“木料！”
    年轻人在边疆建设中，受到了最好的锻炼，从上海到宁夏参加建设的青年陈乃瑜，他在泾源县参加兴修水利时所表现的自我牺牲精神，受到当地人民的赞扬。陈乃瑜到了泾源县后，听说这里有上百万亩的土地遭受干旱，看到中共泾源县委书记马思执亲自攀登大山寻找引水线路，于是他怀着激动的心情，要求做水利工作，他的这种正当要求，得到了党的支持，他很快就学会了一些水利和勘测的技术。在征服老龙潭的战斗中，他和突击队的青年们面对着龙潭峡谷的峭壁宣誓：“为了给百万亩土地解渴，为了祖国边疆的建设事业，我们排除万难，一定能引水上山。”这个工程十分艰险，老龙潭峡谷的峭峰高耸云霄，过去曾有人想探出一条引水的砭道而跌死在峭峰下面。为了探出砭道，陈乃瑜和他的伙伴冒着生命危险，从悬岩上蹓到峭壁，吊在空中勘测，终于测出了砭道。
    这几个优秀的青年人，都出席了第二次全国青年建设社会主义积极分子大会。在建设边疆的光荣、壮丽的事业中，他们的青春放出了灿烂的光辉。
