Ordinary and Extraordinary
    Yao Renwei

    "Every job has potential, it all depends on how you do it. Some people can make ordinary work extraordinary, while others can make extraordinary work very mediocre."

    These words were written by Comrade Sheng Guoping, a cook at the Shanghai Tianfu Ribbon Factory and a representative at the National Youth Activist Congress, in his article "Serving the People is the Greatest Happiness" (published in the People's Daily on November 22nd). The words are insightful and moving, and Comrade Sheng Guoping's own exemplary deeds are the most vivid and best illustration of the above truth. Because he wholeheartedly wanted the workers to have hot meals and dishes, he racked his brains day and night and used waste materials to make a warmer; because he was determined to carry out technical revolution in the cooking work, he successively made blowers, semi-automatic dishwashers, semi-automatic sweet potato peelers, etc.

    From this, I also thought of some other things: While many biologists are still carrying out "research work" year after year, Li Shimei, who only studied in junior high school for one year, has found the best method in the world to prevent and control termites; when engineers all over the world were powerless, an ordinary Chinese worker was able to invent an automated anti-enclosure disc; Ma Jingyun, who had only worked as a car driver and welder, successfully researched and developed friction welding, a method with international advanced standards; farmer Wang Baojing became a researcher at the Shaanxi Agricultural Research Institute. Pest control, working, and farming can all be said to be extremely ordinary, things that millions of people have to do. These people also seem to be very ordinary people, but they have created extraordinary achievements. It can truly be said that they have made ordinary work outstanding.

    But why are they able to be so extraordinary? I believe that in addition to their own diligent labor practice, coupled with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and paying attention to accumulating experience, studying theory, and improving knowledge in practice, the most important point is that they have the ambition to build socialism in their hearts. Only by first solving the problem of "working for whom" can we easily solve the problem of "how to work". The relationship between the two is closely linked. It is not difficult to imagine that a person who does not love the collective cause and only cares about personal fame and fortune can have any accomplishments. Those bourgeois experts and scholars who are divorced from reality, seemingly extraordinary, are actually mediocre and accomplish nothing, and their fatal flaw lies here.

    Comrade Sheng Guoping's deeds once again tell us that in our society, there is only a difference in revolutionary division of labor, and there is no ordinary or extraordinary work. What determines it is your attitude towards serving the people. Chairman Mao taught us long ago in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person who is of great benefit to the people. A man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who is free from low tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people." And those who despise this kind of ordinary work are just the opposite.

    平凡和不平凡
    姚人为
    “什么工作都有出息，单看你怎么作法，有人可以把平凡的工作作得不平凡，有人也可把不平凡的工作作得很庸俗。”
    这几句话是全国青年积极分子大会代表、上海天福织带厂炊事员盛国屏同志写的“侍候人民是最幸福的事”一文中谈到的（登在11月22日人民日报）。话很警辟动人，盛国屏同志本身的模范事迹就是上述真理的最生动最好的说明。由于他一心一意要使工人兄弟吃到热饭热菜，就日夜动脑筋，利用废料做了一只保暖器；由于他决心在炊事工作上大搞技术革命，又先后制成了鼓风机、半自动洗碗器、半自动剥山芋皮器等。
    从这里，我又联想到一些事情来：当多少生物学家们还在年复一年进行着“研究工作”时，只念过一年初中的李始美却就找出了目前世界上最好的防治白蚁的方法；在全世界的工程师们都无能为力时，中国一个普通工人却能发明自动化反围盘；只当过汽车司机和焊工的马景云，研究成功具有国际先进水平的摩擦焊接法；农民王保京成为陕西农业研究所的研究员；治虫、作工、种地都可以说是极平凡的，千百万人都要做的事，这些人看起来也都是很平凡的人，但是却创造发明了不平凡的事绩，这真可以说是把平凡的工作作得出类拔萃的了。
    但是他们为什么能够这样不平凡呢？我认为除了通过他们自己勤奋的劳动实践，再加上具有敢想、敢说、敢为的革新精神，在实践中注意积累经验钻研理论提高知识以外，最主要的一点还在于他们胸中怀着建设社会主义的雄心壮志。只有先解决了“为谁作”的问题，才容易解决“怎么作”的问题，两者的关系是紧密相联的。不难设想，一个不热爱集体事业、只是斤斤计较个人名利的人他能有什么作为。那些脱离实际的资产阶级专家学者们，貌似不平凡，实际上庸庸碌碌，无所作为，它的致命伤也就在这里。
    盛国屏同志的事迹，又一次告诉我们：在我们的社会里，只有革命分工的不同，没有什么平凡与不平凡的工作，决定的是你为人民服务的态度问题。毛主席在“纪念白求恩”一文中早就教导我们：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”而那些轻视这种平凡工作的人，则是恰恰相反。
