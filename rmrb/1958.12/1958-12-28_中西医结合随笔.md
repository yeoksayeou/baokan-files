Random Notes on Integrating Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine

　　Consulting on Stubborn Illnesses

　　The December 4th edition of the Beijing Evening News reported that the collaborative efforts of traditional Chinese and Western medicine at Peking Union Medical College Hospital had subdued stubborn illnesses such as cirrhosis of the liver and gastric ulcers. This is indeed good news – a boon for patients.

　　Western medicine's treatment for cirrhosis of the liver, before ascites appears, mainly involves a high-protein, low-fat diet, careful attention to taking vitamins and lipotropic agents, and rest. After ascites appears, in addition to passively draining the fluid, certain vascular anastomosis procedures can be performed. The most important aspect of Western medicine's treatment of gastric ulcers is emphasizing mental well-being, strictly adhering to dietary regimens, avoiding raw, cold, hard, and irritating foods, and taking some supplementary medications. If the condition is severe, a portion or all of the stomach may need to be removed. In short, while Western medicine has some methods for treating these two diseases, it is far more challenging than treating illnesses like pneumonia and malaria, making it highly necessary to explore new treatment avenues.

　　Traditional Chinese medicine does not recognize these two diseases as such. Generally, treatment begins when patients exhibit symptoms. For example, when cirrhosis patients exhibit poor appetite, right upper abdominal distension and pain, nausea, vomiting, and irregular bowel movements in the early stages, traditional Chinese medicine attributes this to liver qi stagnation and disharmony between the spleen and stomach. In the Five Elements theory, the liver belongs to wood, and according to the principle of mutual restraint, wood can restrain earth (earth being a metaphor for the stomach). Thus, the aforementioned series of symptoms represent the "wood restraining earth" phenomenon. As for the early symptoms of gastric ulcers, they closely resemble those of early cirrhosis, leading traditional Chinese medicine to often treat these two conditions as the same ailment. The primary treatment for these symptoms involves soothing the liver to resolve stagnation and regulating the spleen and stomach. While this explanation may seem unscientific, the fact that it can cure the illnesses suggests that there is a rationale worthy of investigation.

　　However, when the disease is in its early stages, or even when the disease is severe but the patient does not show obvious symptoms (some gastric ulcer patients only discover the condition when the stomach perforates), traditional Chinese medicine may not be aware of the illness. This is because traditional Chinese medicine primarily relies on "pattern identification and treatment," and without symptoms, there is no basis for treatment. Furthermore, the treatment's effectiveness relies mainly on the patient's subjective feelings, and without treatment, there is a lack of objective evidence. This is precisely where Western medicine is needed for integration and mutual improvement.

　　Thoughts Triggered by a Cold

　　Western medicine typically treats colds with "A.P.C." This is the most commonly used medication, and many patients can self-administer it.

　　After studying traditional Chinese medicine, I have discovered that it also has unique advantages in treating colds. Moreover, the treatment's effectiveness is no less than that of aspirin, often resulting in recovery by the next day after taking the medication.

　　Two commonly used traditional Chinese medicine formulas for treating colds are Sang Ju Yin (Mulberry Leaf and Chrysanthemum Drink) and Yin Qiao San (Honeysuckle and Forsythia Powder). Sang Ju Yin has already "won the hearts of the people" in China. Anyone with a slight headache or fever can buy a few cents' worth of mulberry leaves and chrysanthemum flowers, brew them in hot water, drink a hot cup, and cover themselves with a blanket to sleep for a while, and they will soon feel much better. The components of Yin Qiao San have now been compressed into tablets – Yin Qiao Jie Du Pian (Honeysuckle and Forsythia Detoxification Tablets) – making them even more convenient to take.

　　These two formulas can be found in Wu Jutong's "Wen Bing Tiao Bian" (Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases), written during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, people were unaware of "cold viruses," let alone bacteria that were dozens or hundreds of times larger than viruses! Back then, it was simply believed that patients were invaded by wind and cold, causing pathogenic factors to wreak havoc in the body, leading to fever. Therefore, pungent and cooling herbs were used for treatment. Pungent herbs can expel wind, while cooling herbs can clear heat. Sang Ju Yin is called a mild pungent-cooling formula, and Yin Qiao San is called a balanced pungent-cooling formula.

　　These pungent-cooling agents are not only effective for colds but also for certain early-stage febrile diseases. Some researchers have found that taking these pungent-cooling medications during outbreaks of influenza can not only prevent the occurrence of complications but also shorten the course of the disease. These formulas are sometimes even used during certain stages of Japanese encephalitis.

　　Mutual learning, research, and improvement between Western and traditional Chinese medicine are indeed highly necessary.

    中西医结合随笔  
    蔡景峰
    会诊顽疾
    12月4日北京晚报载，北京协和医院中西配合，使顽疾肝硬化、胃溃疡低头。这确是一个喜讯——病家的福音。
    西医治疗肝硬变，在腹水未出现以前，主要是高蛋白低脂肪饮食，多注意服用维生素、去脂素及注意休息；出现腹水以后，除去消极地抽腹水以外，还可以行某些血管的吻合术。西医治疗胃溃疡，最重要的是强调精神愉快，严格注意饮食制度，不能吃生的、冷的、硬的及有刺激性的食物，还有可以服一些辅助药品，如果病情严重，就需要把胃的一部或是全部切除。总之，西医在这两种病上，虽然较有办法，却要比治疗肺炎、疟疾……等病伤脑筋得多，所以很有必要在治疗方面开辟新的道路。
    祖国医学并不知道这两种病，一般是病人表现出症状来，再来治疗它。比如，当肝硬化病人在早期表现出胃口不佳、右上腹胀痛、恶心呕吐、大便不规则时，中医认为这是肝郁不舒、脾胃不和的缘故。肝在五行里属木，依照五行生克的说法木病可以克土（土就是胃的代名词），所以出现了上述一系列“木克土”的病象。至于胃溃疡的早期症状，酷似早期肝硬变，因而中医常把这两种病当作同一种病来治疗。治疗这些症候主要就在舒肝化郁，调理脾胃。虽然这一套解释看来不够科学，然而居然把病治好了，可见这里面还是有值得研究的道理。
    但是，当疾病在较早期，或甚至病已严重，而病人不表现明显症状时（有些胃溃疡病人直到胃穿孔时才发现症状），中医就可能不知道他有病。因为中医主要是“辨证论治”，无症就无所谓治；而且治疗效果主要也是靠病人主观感觉，不治就缺乏客观证据。这也正是需要西医来结合，互相提高的一点。
    从伤风想起的
    西医治伤风，一般是用“爱皮西”（A．P．C）。这是最常用的药，有许多病人自己也能掌握了。
    学习中医以后，我发现用中药治疗伤风，也有独到之处。而且治疗效果，也并不下于阿司匹灵，往往吃过药第二天，就好了。
    治伤风常用的中药有桑菊饮和银翘散两贴方子。桑菊饮在我国民间已经“深得人心”，谁只要有点头痛脑热，买几分钱桑叶、菊花，用开水一泡，热腾腾地喝它一杯，盖上被睡一会儿，不多久就好多了。银翘散的成分现在已经压成药片——银翘解毒片，吃起来更便当。
    这两个方子，在清代嘉庆年间的吴鞠通的“温病条辨”一书中就见到的。当时别说不知道“伤风病毒”，就是比病毒大上几十几百倍的细菌也不知道呢！那时候，仅仅认为病人是受了风、寒的侵袭，以致病邪在体内作孽，使人发热，所以就用辛、凉的药来治。辛可以驱风，凉可以解热。桑菊饮就叫做辛凉轻剂，银翘散就叫做辛凉平剂。
    这些辛凉剂，不但对伤风有效，对某些初起热性病也有效。有人研究过，在流行性感冒猖獗时，服用这种辛凉剂药品，不但可以防止并发症的发生，还可以缩短病程，甚至在乙型脑炎的某些阶段，有时也用得着这些方剂。
    西医中医，互相学习、研究、提高，实在大有必要。
