Using Winches for Soil Transport is Good

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the results of using winches for soil transport at the Old Dragon River water conservancy construction site in Taixing, Jiangsu, each winch operated by ten people (four people pushing the winch, four people supporting the cart and dumping soil, and two people digging soil) can achieve an average efficiency of ten to twelve cubic meters per person per day when the distance is between one hundred and one hundred and fifty meters, which is more than double the efficiency of manual pushing carts for soil transport. A large single-pillar winch has also been created at the Old Dragon River construction site, which can both pull vehicles to transport soil and act as a crane, making it superior to small winches. Its effect is even greater when used for climbing slopes to transport soil.

    绞关运土好
    本报讯  据江苏泰兴老龙河水利工地使用绞关运土的结果表明，每部绞关十个人操作（四人推绞关，四人扶车和倒土、二人挖土）在距离一百到一百五十公尺情况下，每人每天平均功效达十到十二方，比人力推车运土功效提高一倍以上。在老龙河工地上还创造了一种大型独柱式绞关，既能牵引车辆运土、又能做起重机，比小型绞关更优越。用于爬坡运土，作用更大。
