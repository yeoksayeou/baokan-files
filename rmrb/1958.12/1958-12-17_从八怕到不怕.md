From Eight Fears to No Fears
Song Qiying, Pengdian Commune Nursery Worker, Cangxi County, Sichuan

Our township originally had two day-care kindergartens. After the establishment of a commune in our township this September, "three transformations" were implemented. Families lived scattered on different hills and ridges, and going out meant climbing slopes. The surrounding five or six *li* were too far for the nursery workers to pick up and drop off each child, which meant parents had to make three trips a day. This directly affected the adults' ability to work on time. Summer was even more troublesome; the sun was scorching, and the children, barefooted, could hardly stand the heat on the ground, and their heads felt like they were being baked. Rainy days made the roads even harder to walk, and the kindergartens had to close for several days every time it rained. The children, waking up early and going to bed late with the adults, also suffered serious health problems. Therefore, parents requested the establishment of full-time kindergartens, with some even making repeated applications to the Party branch.

Things were not always so smooth. Although most people were willing, a few still had varying degrees of concern, especially parents with only children or those who were overly doting. Some mothers were unwilling, while others were opposed by the fathers. Generally, parents had eight main fears: 1. Fear that their children wouldn't eat enough or wouldn't eat well, with inconsistent meals and exposure to extremes of temperature; 2. Fear that their children wouldn't be properly covered with blankets; 3. Fear that their children would quarrel and fight; 4. Fear that their children would fall off cliffs or into the water; 5. Fear that they would not have heat on cold days; 6. Fear that if the children got sick, no one would take care of them; 7. Fear that no one would add clothes when the weather changed, and the children would catch a cold; 8. Fear that the teachers wouldn't be patient or fair.

The Party General Branch and the Women's Federation organized a series of meetings involving Party members, Youth League members, cadres, women, the elderly, and parents. After two days of full mobilization, the original plan was to enroll thirty children, but sixty-two children were registered. Thus, the full-time kindergarten was established.

When the children first entered the kindergarten, they had different personalities due to their different family education. Some children wouldn't leave their parents; after being dropped off, they would run back home. The older children, not used to playing together, ran around everywhere, and the younger ones cried in the direction they came from. Some children stared blankly all day without saying a word. In short, it was a chaotic scene, with some crying, some闹ing, and everyone shouting. It was even worse at night; some wanted their grandmothers, some wanted their mothers, some wanted to be carried on backs, and some wanted to be held. This one fell asleep, then that one woke up, this one needed to defecate, and that one needed to urinate. We had no choice but to carry this one on our backs and hold that one, until every child fell asleep. Later, we gradually became skilled in this work. We made simple toys for the children using mud, bamboo, and cardboard, and took them to the mountains to pick wildflowers and pull weeds to feed the rabbits, which enriched their knowledge and exercised their bodies. We also took time to learn songs and dances at the complete primary school and taught them to the children when we returned. Currently, the children can not only sing more than a dozen small songs such as "Socialism is Good," "The East is Red," and "Kindergarten," but also dance more than ten kinds of dances such as "Picking Cotton" and "Planting Wheat." We also divided the children into two classes, selected class leaders, arranged seating at mealtimes, selected seat leaders, and assigned fixed seats, bowls, and chopsticks to each child. They were no longer as disobedient as before. At night, they went to their designated beds to sleep, and mealtimes were also orderly. We not only paid attention to cultivating the children's sense of collectivism, but also paid attention to cultivating their ability to live independently and their labor habits. For example, the children could take care of simple daily life tasks such as adding rice, washing their faces, washing dishes, and washing their feet. With the help of the complete primary school, the kindergarten has now established a relatively formal curriculum. As for the parents' eight fears, they now have none.

    从八怕到不怕
    四川苍溪县彭店公社保育员  宋其英
    我们乡里原来办了两个日托幼儿园。今年9月全乡成立一个公社后，实行了“三化”。各家这山那岭居住分散，出门就是爬坡上坎。周围五、六里远，保育员不可能一一接送，这就必须家长一天跑三趟。接来送去的，直接影响到大人按时出工。夏天更恼火，太阳晒得火辣辣的，特别是中午，打着赤脚的孩子，简直不敢挨地，头上也像火烤。下雨路更难走，幼儿园也只得下几天雨就放几天假。孩子们随着大人早起晚睡，也严重地影响了身体健康。因此家长们纷纷要求建立全托幼儿园，有的还向党支部再三申请。
    事情总不是那么顺利，虽然大多数人愿意，少数人还是有不同程度的顾虑，特别是独子或对孩子溺爱的家长，不是妈不愿就是爹不准。一般家长主要有八怕：一怕小孩吃不饱，吃不好，饿饱不匀，冷热不均；二怕孩子盖不好被盖；三怕孩子吵嘴打架；四怕孩子跌崖落水；五怕天气冷烤不上火；六怕孩子生病没人管；七怕天气变化无人加衣服，孩子要受凉；八怕教师不耐心不公平。
    党总支和妇联组织就召开了党团员、干部、妇女、老人、家长等一系列的会议。经过两天的充分发动，原计划收托三十个孩子，结果有六十二个孩子报了名。这样，全托幼儿园便建立起来了。
    孩子刚入园，由于所受家庭教育的不同，性格也不一致。有的娃儿不离大人，前头送来，后头又跑回去，大点的孩子耍不惯到处跑，小的朝着自己来的路叫喊，有的孩子一天瞪着眼不开腔。总之乱糟糟的，吵的吵，闹的闹，嚷成一团。到了晚上就更淘气了，有的要婆婆，有的要妈妈，有的要背，有的要抱；这个睡着了，那个又醒了，这个要屙屎，那个要撒尿。我们没有办法，只好背了这个又抱那个，直到每个孩子都入睡。后来我们渐渐熟练了这项工作。我们用泥巴、竹子、纸壳等给孩子做一些简单的玩具，带孩子们上山采野花，扯野草喂兔子，这样既丰富了孩子们的知识，又锻炼了孩子们的身体。我们又抽时间到完小学习歌舞，回来教给孩子。目前孩子们不仅能唱“社会主义好”“东方红”“幼儿园”等十几首小型歌曲，还会跳“摘棉花”“点小麦”等十几种舞蹈。我们又将孩子分作两个班，选了班长，吃饭编了席桌，选了席长，席位、碗筷等都固定给孩子。他们再也不像以前那么不听话了，晚上自己到各人安置的铺位上睡觉，吃饭也有秩序了。我们不仅注意培养孩子们的集体观念，还注意培养他们独立生活的能力和劳动习惯，比如添饭、洗脸、洗碗、洗脚等，简单的日常生活，孩子们都能自理了。在完小的帮助下，幼儿园现在已建立起较正规的课程。至于家长们的八怕，现在一怕也不怕了。
