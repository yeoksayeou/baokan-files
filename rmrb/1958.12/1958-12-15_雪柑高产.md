Xinhua News Agency report: In the Yaosha Camp of the Hongqi Commune in Nan'yu, Minhou County, Fujian, a 1.05-mu orange orchard harvested a total of 46,992 jin of Xuegan oranges, averaging 44,754.4 jin of Xuegan oranges per mu, a 7.13-fold increase compared to the bumper harvest last year.

On the 6th, early in the morning, a picking team of more than 300 people began harvesting in this orange orchard. It took them more than three hours to finish, filling a total of 829 boxes. More than a thousand commune members working in the surrounding fields rushed to congratulate them upon hearing the news of the bumper harvest.

The 74-year-old woman, Zhuo Er'mei, leaning on her crutch, asked her grandson to help her visit. When she saw the boxes of yellow-orange Xuegan oranges spread all over the ground, she touched them and looked at them again and again, excitedly saying, "I have been growing citrus fruits all my life, and this is the first time I have seen such a good harvest."

There are a total of 42 orange trees in this orchard, all of which are 26-year-old mature trees, managed by more than 20 people. They displayed a spirit of hard work and meticulousness in their management. First of all, a lot of fertilizer was applied, and it was applied reasonably. The entire garden was fertilized with a total of 2,310 dan of river mud, 150 dan of human manure, and 80 jin of chemical fertilizer. Secondly, pests were eliminated. "666" powder and lime sulfur mixture were sprayed a total of nine times, and pests were manually killed fourteen times, ensuring that pests were killed whenever they were found, leaving no pests behind. At the same time, field management was strengthened, ensuring that there were no weeds on the ground and no dead branches on the trees. In June and July, this orange orchard was hit by mountain floods and typhoons. Thanks to the collective efforts of the soldiers and civilians to tie up the branches, they finally overcame the floods and typhoons. (Attached photo)

    雪柑高产
    据新华社讯  福建闽侯县南屿红旗公社尧沙营，在一块一点零五亩柑园里，共采雪柑四万六千九百九十二斤，平均每亩产雪柑四万四千七百五十四斤四两，比去年大年增产七点一三倍。
    6日清早，这块柑园由三百多人组成的采摘队开始采摘，整整忙了三个多小时才采摘结束，共装了八百二十九箱。正在周围原野耕田的一千多个社员闻到丰收喜讯后，纷纷赶来祝贺。
    七十四岁老太婆卓二妹拄着拐杖，叫她的孙儿扶着来参观，当她看到铺满地上的一箱一箱黄橙橙大雪柑时，摸了又看，看了又摸，激动地说：“我种柑桔一生，这么好的收成还是第一次见过。”
    这片柑树共有四十二株，都是二十六龄的壮年树，由二十多人专责管理。在管理工作上发挥了刻苦、细致的精神。首先是肥料下得多，下得合理，全园共施河泥二千三百一十担、人粪一百五十担和八十斤化学肥料。其次是消灭虫害，共喷射了九次“六六六”粉和硫磺合剂，先后经过十四次人工捕杀虫害，做到有虫就杀，一虫不留。同时加强田间管理，做到地上不留杂草，树上不留枯枝。6月和7月间，这片柑园曾遇到山洪和台风的侵袭，由于兵民们全体出动，把树枝捆住，终于战胜了水灾和风灾。（附图片）
