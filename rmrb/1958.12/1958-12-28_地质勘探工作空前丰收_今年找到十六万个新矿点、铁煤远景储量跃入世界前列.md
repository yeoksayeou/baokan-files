Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: China's work in searching for underground treasures achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1958. This year, 160,000 new mineral deposits were found nationwide, 3.6 times more than the total number of mineral deposits found during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. The reserves explored for several major minerals have greatly exceeded the national plans set at the beginning of this year, and some have even exceeded the total reserves proven during the First Five-Year Plan period.

With the vigorous development of the mass campaign for steelmaking and coal mining in various places, iron and coal are the two major resources that have achieved the greatest harvest in exploration this year. The prospective iron reserves have jumped from an estimated 18 billion tons at the beginning of the year to 100 billion tons, second only to the Soviet Union, ranking second in the world. The prospective coal reserves have also far exceeded the estimated 1.5 trillion tons at the beginning of the year, ranking among the top in the world. At present, China has mastered more than 600 iron ore producing areas, of which only the large iron ore producing areas can meet the needs of each economic cooperation zone to establish one or several steel enterprises with an annual output of several million tons. As for small and medium-sized iron ore, they are even more ubiquitous. Due to the discovery of a large number of new coalfields in the southern and northwestern provinces, the so-called "no coal in Jiangnan" theory has been completely bankrupt, providing favorable conditions for rapidly changing the unbalanced distribution of China's coal industry.

Copper, which was once considered by imperialist scholars to be very scarce in China, has seen its proven reserves or prospective reserves soar this year due to the expansion of old mining areas and the continuous discovery of new mineral producing areas. According to statistics, dozens of large and medium-sized copper mines have been newly discovered this year.

The three minerals of tungsten, tin, and molybdenum, which were originally ranked first in the world, have also made great progress this year. At present, the proven reserves of these three minerals can ensure the needs of China's rapidly growing steel industry.

In addition, dozens of new aluminum mines have been discovered this year. The proven reserves of nickel and chromium mines, which were extremely scarce during the First Five-Year Plan period, are estimated to exceed dozens of times the total proven reserves in the past few years in just one year. Large potassium mines and large boron mines, which had never been discovered, have now been found in inland salt lakes such as Qinghai and Tibet. Other minerals such as manganese, magnesium, lead, zinc, sulfur, phosphorus, petroleum, oil shale, mica, asbestos, and rare metals necessary for the development of cutting-edge industries have also made many important discoveries this year.

All these fruitful results provide sufficient and reliable mineral resources for China to establish a complete industrial system and gradually build a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

The bumper harvest of China's underground treasures this year also proves the complete correctness of the policy of the whole party and the whole people running geology under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction. This policy has generated great vitality since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call for taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward. In order to find resources needed for steel and other industries, Party committee secretaries in various places personally took command and mobilized tens of thousands of people to go to the mountains to find mines. With the heroic spirit of "declaring war on the earth and asking the mountains to offer treasures," they almost turned over all the mountains and conducted an unprecedented large-scale general survey of China's rich underground resources. Therefore, in just a few months, many secrets of the earth that had never been discovered in the past were quickly revealed. Many provinces have discovered important minerals such as coal, iron, sulfur, and phosphorus in almost every county. Henan Province had not found the Central Plains iron ore base urgently needed by the state after several explorations by geological personnel in the past. After mobilizing the masses to find mines this year, it was quickly found in Xin'an County.

The vast number of geological personnel breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, and improving exploration procedures and working methods have also played a great role in promoting this year's prospecting work. Now, they can obtain one to two times more mineral reserves with the same workload than during the First Five-Year Plan period. The average drilling speed of drilling rigs has also increased by more than double compared to the past. Many geological teams have also greatly improved the accuracy of exploration due to their close contact with the local people and their ability to absorb the opinions of "local" experts.

    地质勘探工作空前丰收 
    今年找到十六万个新矿点、铁煤远景储量跃入世界前列
    据新华社27日讯  1958年我国寻找地下宝藏的工作获得了空前未有的丰收。这一年全国找到的新矿点有十六万个，比第一个五年计划期间找到的全部矿点还多三点六倍。几项主要矿种探得的储量，都大大超过了今年年初制定的国家计划，有的甚至超过了第一个五年计划期间所探明的储量的总和。
    随着各地全民办钢铁和全民办煤矿运动的蓬勃开展，铁和煤是今年勘查中获得最大丰收的两项主要资源。铁的远景储量已从年初估计的一百八十亿吨跃进到一千亿吨，仅次于苏联，占世界第二位。煤的远景储量也远远超过了年初估计的一万五千亿吨，跃居世界的前列。目前，我国掌握的铁矿产地已有六百多处，其中仅是大型的铁矿产地就能满足各个经济协作区建立一个或几个年产数百万吨的钢铁企业的需要。至于中小型的铁矿更是遍及各地。由于在南方与西北各省发现了大量新煤田，所谓“江南无煤论”等已经彻底破产，为迅速改变我国煤炭工业分布不平衡现象提供了有利条件。
    曾经被帝国主义学者认为我国十分缺乏的铜，今年由于老矿区的扩大和新矿产地的不断发现，已探明的储量或远景储量都扶摇直上。据统计，今年新发现的大中型铜矿就有几十个。
    原来就已居世界首位的钨、锡、钼三种矿产，今年也有很大发展。目前这三种矿产已经探明的储量能够保证我国钢铁工业急剧增长的需要。
    此外，今年新发现的铝矿也有好几十处。原来在第一个五年计划期间极感缺乏的镍矿和铬矿，估计今年一年的探明储量就将超过过去几年探明储量总和的几十倍。原来一直没有发现的大钾矿和大硼矿，现在也已在青海和西藏等内陆盐湖中找到了。其他像锰、镁、铅、锌、硫、磷、石油、油母页岩、云母、石棉和发展尖端工业必需的稀有金属等，今年都有不少重要发现。
    所有这些丰收成果，为我国建立完整的工业体系，逐步建成具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家，提供了充分可靠的矿产资源。
    今年我国地下宝藏的丰收，同时也证明了在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全党全民办地质的方针的完全正确。这一方针，在中共中央提出以钢为纲、全面跃进的号召后，更产生了伟大的生命力。各地为了寻找钢铁及其他工业需要的资源，由党委书记亲自挂帅，发动成千上万群众上山找矿。他们以“向地球开战，要高山献宝”的豪迈气概，几乎翻遍了所有的山头，对我国丰富的地下资源进行了一次史无前例的最大规模的普查。因而，在短短几个月内，许多过去从未发现的大地秘密，就很快地被揭露了出来。很多省几乎县县都发现了煤、铁、硫、磷等重要矿产。河南省过去经地质人员几次勘查，都未找到国家急需的中原铁矿基地，今年在发动群众找矿以后，很快就在新安县找到了。
    广大地质人员破除迷信、解放思想，改进勘探程序和工作方法，对于今年的找矿工作也起了极大的促进作用。现在，他们用同样的工作量就能获得比第一个五年计划期间多一倍到两倍的矿产储量。钻机的平均钻探速度也比过去加快了一倍以上。许多地质队还由于密切联系了当地的群众，善于吸收“土”专家的意见，勘探的正确性也比过去大大提高了。
