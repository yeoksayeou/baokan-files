Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: China's famous breaststroke swimmer, Mu Xiangxiong, today in Beijing broke the world record for the men's 100-meter breaststroke with a time of one minute and eleven point four seconds, adding a glorious page to Chinese sports history.

The twenty-three-year-old Mu Xiangxiong had made six attempts this year on the men's 100-meter breaststroke world record of one minute and eleven point five seconds (held by Soviet athlete Minashkin). Today, when he participated in the last competition of the year and made his seventh attempt on this record, he finally realized his great ambition of breaking the world record.

Since the International Amateur Swimming Federation's regulation prohibiting underwater swimming in breaststroke came into effect on May 1, 1957, China's other famous breaststroke swimmer, Qi Lieyun, broke the world record's minimum standard of one minute and thirteen seconds in Guangzhou with a time of one minute and eleven point six seconds, becoming the first to set the world record for the men's 100-meter breaststroke. However, on September 15th of that year, the famous Soviet breaststroke swimmer Minashkin improved this world record by one-tenth of a second. From August this year, Mu Xiangxiong began challenging this world record. On October 19th, in the Sino-Soviet swimming friendship match held in Beijing, he defeated Minashkin, who was visiting China at the time, with a time of one minute and eleven point seven seconds. Today marks the fourth time this year that he has completed the 100-meter breaststroke in under one minute and twelve seconds. The new world record of one minute and eleven point four seconds is almost two seconds faster than his best record from last year (one minute and thirteen point three seconds).

Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Significant achievements were made by athletes from various regions this afternoon at the 1958 Winter Swimming Competition for Outstanding Athletes held at the Beijing Gymnasium Swimming Hall.

Mu Xiangxiong, a famous breaststroke swimmer from Tianjin, finished the 100-meter race with a time of one minute and eleven point four seconds, breaking not only the national record of one minute and eleven point six seconds set by Qi Lieyun in the men's 100-meter breaststroke but also surpassing the world record of one minute and eleven point five seconds held by Soviet athlete Minashkin.

Shanghai athletes Chen Yunpeng and Dai Lihua set three national best records. In the men's 200-meter butterfly race, Chen Yunpeng improved the national record of two minutes and thirty-eight point seven seconds held by Wang Qiangli to two minutes and thirty-four point four seconds. This is an improvement over the new national record of two minutes and thirty-four point five seconds he set in September this year. Chen Yunpeng also participated in the men's 100-meter butterfly race today and broke the national record of one minute and six point one seconds with a time of one minute and five point one seconds. He had also achieved a better result in October this year (one minute and four point three seconds).

Dai Lihua set a national best record of one minute and twenty-five point five seconds in the women's 100-meter sidestroke race today. This result far exceeds the national record of one minute and thirty-eight point four seconds.

In the women's 400-meter freestyle race held today, Fujian athlete Fu Cuimei also broke the national record of five minutes and forty-three point six seconds with a time of five minutes and forty-one point five seconds.

    穆祥雄创百公尺蛙泳世界纪录
    各地优秀游泳选手创优异成绩
    据新华社20日讯  我国著名的蛙泳选手穆祥雄今天在北京以一分十一秒四的成绩打破了男子一百公尺蛙泳的世界纪录，为中国体育史上增加了光辉的一页。
    二十三岁的穆祥雄今年曾经向一分十一秒五的男子一百公尺蛙泳世界纪录（由苏联选手米纳什金保持）做了六次冲击。今天，当他参加今年的最后一次比赛和向这个纪录做第七次冲击的时候，终于实现了他打破世界纪录的宏愿。
    自从国际业余游泳联合会在游蛙泳时不能利用潜泳的规定生效的第一天——1957年5月1日，我国另一个著名的蛙泳选手戚烈云就在广州以一分十一秒六的成绩突破了世界纪录的最低标准——一分十三秒，第一个创造了男子一百公尺蛙泳的世界纪录。但是，在这一年9月15日，著名的苏联蛙泳选手米纳什金又把这项世界纪录提高了十分之一秒。从今年8月起，穆祥雄就开始冲击这项世界纪录。10月19日，在北京举行的中苏游泳友谊赛中，他就以一分十一秒七的成绩战胜了当时来中国访问的米纳什金。今天，这已经是他今年第四次在一分十二秒以内游完一百公尺蛙泳了。一分十一秒四的世界新纪录，比他去年的最高纪录（一分十三秒三）快了将近两秒钟。
    新华社20日讯  今天下午在北京体育馆游泳馆举行1958年各地优秀选手冬季游泳比赛时，各地选手创造了显著成绩。
    天津市著名的蛙泳选手穆祥雄以一分十一秒四的成绩游完了一百公尺，不仅打破了戚烈云创造的男子一百公尺蛙泳一分十一秒六的全国纪录，而且还超过了苏联运动员米纳什金保持的一分十一秒五的世界纪录。
    上海选手陈运鹏、戴丽华创造了三项全国最高成绩。在男子二百公尺蝶泳比赛中，陈运鹏把王强立保持的二分三十八秒七的全国纪录提高到了二分三十四秒四。这比他今年9月间创造的二分三十四秒五的全国新成绩有了提高。陈运鹏今天还参加了男子一百公尺蝶泳比赛，并且以一分五秒一的成绩打破一分六秒一的全国纪录。今年10月间他还曾经创造过更好的成绩（一分四秒三）。
    戴丽华今天在女子一百公尺侧泳比赛中创造了一分二十五秒五的全国最好成绩。这个成绩已经远远超过了一分三十八秒四的全国纪录。
    在今天举行的女子四百公尺自由泳比赛中，福建选手傅翠美也以五分四十一秒五的成绩打破了五分四十三秒六的全国纪录。
