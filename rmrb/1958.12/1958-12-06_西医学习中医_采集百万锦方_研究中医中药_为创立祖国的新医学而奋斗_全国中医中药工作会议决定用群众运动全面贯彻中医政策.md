Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 5th: The National Conference on Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbs, lasting sixteen days, closed in Baoding on the 2nd. Vice Minister of Health Xu Yunbei gave a summary at the meeting, and Zhang Jiafu, Deputy Director of the Second Office of the State Council, spoke at the meeting.

This conference, guided by the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, and in the spirit of rectification, focused on summarizing the achievements and exchanging experiences in traditional Chinese medicine work over the past few years. At the same time, it further criticized all kinds of bourgeois ideologies that underestimated, discriminated against, and excluded traditional Chinese medicine in traditional Chinese medicine work, unified the ideological understanding of leaders in the health departments, and determined that in the future, large-scale efforts should be made to promote Western doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine, collect "a million excellent prescriptions," carry out research on traditional Chinese medicine and herbs, launch mass movements for the large-scale production of Chinese medicine, and strive to create a new medicine for the motherland.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the Party's policy of uniting Western and traditional Chinese medicine, inheriting and developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and serving socialist construction, health departments in various regions have criticized Comrade He Cheng's erroneous thinking of underestimating, discriminating against, and excluding traditional Chinese medicine, and great achievements have been made in traditional Chinese medicine work. The political status of traditional Chinese medicine has been elevated to an unprecedented level, and great progress has been made in its professional development, greatly promoting the enthusiasm of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Western doctors have also undergone great changes in their thinking, recognizing in their practical work the role of traditional Chinese medicine in the people's health cause and the richness and diversity of traditional Chinese medicine. The unity and cooperation between Western and traditional Chinese medicine have been strengthened. In particular, since the rectification movement, the political and ideological awareness of the vast number of medical and health personnel has been generally improved, and they have gained a further understanding of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. After the Party proposed breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and vigorously carrying out technological revolutions, the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine and herbs was further explored, solving many diseases that were considered untreatable. The treatment methods and efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine for some diseases have also surpassed Western medicine, such as appendicitis without surgery and gangrene without amputation. Traditional Chinese medicine work has also broken some Western medical concepts, such as willow branch bone grafting and chicken skin replacing human skin, breaking the Western medical concept that allogeneic transplantation is impossible. The meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine provides a new research field for physiology and pathology. The richness and diversity of traditional Chinese medicine have educated everyone, and more and more people are learning traditional Chinese medicine, strengthening the unity and cooperation between Western and traditional Chinese medicine. Many veteran traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are also actively summarizing their experiences and exploring various existing treatment methods. In recent years, great progress has been made in the production, purchase, and sale of Chinese medicinal materials, and many achievements have also been made. Traditional Chinese medicine work across the country has undergone new changes and a new situation has emerged.

Although great achievements have been made in traditional Chinese medicine work, when the delegates, through pragmatism, further studied and understood the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and examined the work in their regions in light of Hebei Province's experience in traditional Chinese medicine work, they believed that although there are not many people who openly oppose traditional Chinese medicine now, there are still many people who oppose traditional Chinese medicine in tangible and intangible ways, and who discriminate against and exclude traditional Chinese medicine in their work. Many medical and health personnel still believe that traditional Chinese medicine is "unscientific," deny that traditional Chinese medicine has a theory, and have a very low opinion of traditional Chinese medicine. When they mention traditional Chinese medicine, they think of it as old and backward. When they mention that traditional Chinese medicine has both essence and dross, they first think of dross. The meeting focused on criticizing this bourgeois ideology of underestimating and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, which exists among a considerable number of medical and health personnel, and the erroneous attitude of some health leaders who regard the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine as trivial, fail to implement it effectively, and are not resolute enough in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. After discussions and debates in the form of great debates, big-character posters, and small group meetings, most people gained a further understanding of the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and the great treasure house of Chinese medicine. The meeting implemented the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, criticizing all kinds of bourgeois ideologies that underestimate, discriminate against, and exclude traditional Chinese medicine, and the erroneous attitude of taking a perfunctory, "neither opposing nor actively supporting" approach to traditional Chinese medicine work.

After unifying their thinking and understanding, the delegates had open minds and were full of confidence, determined to make health work adapt to the new situation of the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the vigorous upsurge of the technological and cultural revolutions, further implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, and make a comprehensive leap forward in traditional Chinese medicine work. The meeting decided that in the future, it is necessary to continue to fight against the concentrated representative of bourgeois ideology that discriminates against and excludes traditional Chinese medicine—He Cheng's thinking—and on this basis, launch mass movements to fully implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. The meeting believes that the first step is to launch a mass movement for Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine. Western doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine is the key to strengthening the unity of Western and traditional Chinese medicine and inheriting and developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the principle of "systematic study, comprehensive mastery, and sorting out and improvement" and carry out mass learning movements, with everyone learning, everyone studying, general mastery, and key improvement. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should organize off-the-job Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine classes, requiring the training of about 2,000 high-level doctors combining Western and traditional Chinese medicine within two or three years as the backbone for sorting out and researching traditional Chinese medicine. All medical and nursing staff should also generally understand and master certain traditional Chinese medicine knowledge through various forms of learning within two or three years, and should be able to possess two sets of disease prevention and treatment skills in their respective professional fields. At the same time, it is necessary to launch a "million excellent prescriptions" collection movement throughout the country to explore the treasures of traditional Chinese medicine and herbs, and eliminate and prevent several diseases that are most harmful to the people, such as schistosomiasis, malaria, hookworm disease, filariasis, as well as cancer, high blood pressure, burns, silicosis, etc. The meeting also made plans for cultivating new forces in traditional Chinese medicine, widely mobilizing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to take on apprentices, running traditional Chinese medicine colleges and schools well, strengthening research on traditional Chinese medicine and herbs, strengthening the production of Chinese medicine, improving business management, making Chinese medicine high-yield and abundant, and basically meeting the supply. Representatives from many provinces and cities enthusiastically responded to the call of this meeting and formulated preliminary work plans for the future. (Attached picture)

    西医学习中医  采集百万锦方  研究中医中药
    为创立祖国的新医学而奋斗
    全国中医中药工作会议决定用群众运动全面贯彻中医政策
    据新华社保定5日电  历时十六天的全国中医中药工作会议，2日在保定闭幕。会议由卫生部副部长徐运北作总结，国务院第二办公室副主任张稼夫在会上讲了话。
    这次会议以党的中医政策方针为纲，用整风的精神，着重总结了过去几年来中医中药工作的成就，交流了经验；同时进一步批判了中医中药工作中的形形色色的轻视、歧视、排斥中医的资产阶级思想，统一了卫生部门领导干部的思想认识，确定今后要大张旗鼓地开展西医学习中医，采集“百万锦方”，开展中医药研究工作，大搞中药生产的群众运动，为创立祖国的新医学而奋斗。
    几年来，中医中药工作在党中央和各级党委的领导下，根据党的团结中西医、继承发扬祖国医学遗产、为社会主义建设服务的方针，各地卫生部门进行了对贺诚同志轻视、歧视、排斥中医错误思想的批判，中医工作取得了很大成绩。中医政治地位空前提高，业务上也得到了很大发展，中医的积极性大为发扬。西医在思想方面也有很大变化，在实际工作中认识到中医在人民卫生事业中的作用和祖国医学的丰富多彩，中西医的团结合作有了加强。特别是整风运动以来，广大医药卫生人员政治思想觉悟普遍提高，对党的中医政策有了进一步认识，当党提出破除迷信、解放思想、大闹技术革命以后，中医中药宝库得到了进一步的发掘；解决了许多认为无法治疗的疾病。中医对于有的疾病的治疗方法和疗效也超过西医，如阑尾炎不作手术、坏疽不用截肢等。中医工作并打破了某些西医学术上的观念，如柳枝接骨、鸡皮代人皮等打破了西医异体不能移植的观念。中医的经络学说为生理、病理学提供了新的研究领域。祖国医学的丰富多彩教育了大家，学习中医的人越来越多，加强了中西医的团结合作，许多老中医也积极总结经验，发掘已有的多种治疗方法。几年来，中药材工作在产、购、销方面有很大发展，也取得了不少成绩，全国中医中药工作已经起了新的变化和出现了新的形势。
    中医中药工作虽然取得了很大成绩，但是当代表们通过务虚，进一步学习领会党的中医政策、结合河北省在中医中药工作中的经验检查本地区工作时，认为现在公开反对中医的人虽然不多，但是有形无形的反对中医，工作上歧视、排斥中医的还大有人在。还有不少的医药卫生人员认为中医“不科学”，否认中医有理论，对中医估计很低，一提到中医，就想到它是古老的、落后的，一提到中医有精华糟粕，就首先想到糟粕。会议着重批判了这种在相当一部分医药卫生人员中存在着的轻视、歧视中医的资产阶级思想和一些卫生领导干部对党的中医政策等闲视之，执行不力，和资产阶级思想斗争不够坚决的错误态度。经过大鸣大放、大字报、小组会的讨论争辩，大多数人对党的中医政策的正确伟大，对中国医药学这个伟大宝库有了进一步的认识。会议贯彻批评与自我批评的精神，批判了形形色色的轻视、歧视、排斥中医的资产阶级思想和对中医中药工作采取无所谓、“既不反对、又不积极”的消极怠工的错误态度。
    代表们在统一思想认识后，思想开阔，信心百倍，决心使卫生工作适应工农业生产的飞跃发展和技术革命、文化革命蓬勃高涨的新形势，进一步贯彻党的中医政策，使中医中药工作全面大跃进。会议决定今后要继续同歧视、排斥中医的资产阶级思想集中的代表——贺诚思想作斗争，并在这个基础上大搞群众运动，用群众运动来全面贯彻党的中医政策。会议认为，首先要开展西医学习中医的群众运动。西医学习中医，是加强中西医团结和继承发扬祖国医学遗产的关键，因而必须贯彻“系统学习，全面掌握，整理提高”的方针和开展群众性学习运动，人人学，大家学，普遍掌握、重点提高。各省市自治区举办离职西医学习中医班，要求在二、三年内培养出两千名左右的中西结合的高级医生，作为整理研究祖国医学的骨干，所有的医护人员在二、三年内也应通过各种形式的学习，普遍了解和掌握一定的中医知识，并且能在自己的专业方面具备中西医两套防治疾病的本领。同时要在全国范围内开展采集“百万锦方”运动，发掘中医中药的珍宝，消灭和防止几种为害人民最大的疾病，如血吸虫病、疟疾、钩虫病、丝虫病、以及癌肿、高血压、烫伤、矽肺等。会议还对培养中医新生力量、广泛发动中医带徒弟、办好中医学院和中医学校、加强中医药研究、加强中药生产、改善经营管理、使中药高产丰收和作到基本上满足供应等方面作了规划。很多省市的代表热烈响应这次会议的号召，纷纷拟定了今后的初步工作规划。（附图片）
