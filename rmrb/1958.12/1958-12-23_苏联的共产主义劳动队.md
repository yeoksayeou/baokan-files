Soviet Union, Moscow—Some members of the Party branch of the locomotive depot at the Moscow marshalling station on the Moscow-Kazan railway organized "Communist Volunteer Saturdays" as early as 1919. They repaired locomotives all night on Saturdays until Sunday morning. Lenin called their behavior a "great initiative." It has been almost forty years since the "Communist Volunteer Saturdays." Now the locomotive depot is repairing new-style locomotives, but the revolutionary creativity tradition of the older generation of Communists has been inherited by the workers. A month ago, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proposed convening the 21st Congress to discuss the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, the Party members and youth of the internal combustion engine repair workshop of the locomotive depot took the lead in launching the Communist competition, and a significant Communist labor work team was born.

    One of the competition conditions for the "Communist Labor Workshop" of the locomotive depot at the Moscow marshalling station is that all young workers in the workshop reach the level of secondary or secondary specialized education within four or five years. 21 people in the workshop are already preparing to enter railway technical schools, and 6 of them are preparing to enter railway engineering colleges. This is a young worker preparing to enter a railway technical school in a preparatory class.

    苏联的共产主义劳动队
    苏联莫斯科——卡赞铁路线莫斯科调车站机车库的党支部的一些成员，早在1919年组织过“共产主义义务星期六”。在星期六连夜赶修机车，一直到星期日的早晨。列宁把他们的行为称作“伟大的创举”。从“共产主义义务星期六”到现在已经快四十年了。现在机车库修理的是新式机车，但是老一代共产党人的革命创造性传统却被工人们继承了下来。一个月前，当苏联共产党提出召开第二十一次代表大会讨论七年计划的控制数字时，机车库的内燃机车修理车间的党团员和青年们首先发起共产主义竞赛，一个意义重大的共产主义劳动工作队就这样诞生了。（附图片）
