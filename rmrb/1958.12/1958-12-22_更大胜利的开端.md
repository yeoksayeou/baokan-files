    Hearing that this year's target of 10.7 million tons of steel has been completed ahead of schedule is truly exceptionally joyful. It's like a major victory message sent from the front lines, or like hearing a joyous song sung by a chorus of ten thousand people.

    When the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the great call this year to double last year's 5.35 million tons of steel, setting the target at 10.7 million tons, everyone was truly excited and inspired. At the time, we were fully confident that this glorious task would be completed, and would be completed ahead of schedule. This is because the policies set and the calls issued by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always been based on a combination of Marxism-Leninism and China's reality, extremely solid and reliable, and also a leap forward, invincible. At the same time, it inspires the masses, allowing them to unleash endless wisdom and power. For example, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, large, medium and small-scale development in steelmaking is an extremely brilliant instruction. On the one hand, we are vigorously developing the world's most advanced steel industry, and on the other hand, we are carrying forward the traditional methods of steelmaking that our ancestors have used for thousands of years, so that everyone can become a steelmaking expert. In the spring of 1952, the first night I went to Anshan, I saw the ten miles of lights shining brilliantly and the fire illuminating the sky. I was amazed by the magnificent scene of our new industry. And today, all over the country at night, where are there no groups of indigenous furnaces emitting red light that illuminates the sky, inspiring people? When I went to Anshan again in the summer of 1956, I saw that the base was being leveled with sheep's horn rollers for new steel plant buildings. Excellent engineers and cadres from the No. 1 Steel Plant had been transferred to specially design new steelmaking equipment. They happily told me: we will have very large open-hearth furnaces. In 1958, the power of large open-hearth furnaces was finally revealed. And new kings of open-hearth furnaces will continue to be built one after another. All this shows that our Party, since the founding of the country, has had a profound and grand plan for the steel industry, and is vigorously promoting it at all times. The early completion of 10.7 million tons of steel this year is due in large part to the important role played by various steel bases.

    Another important factor is that hundreds of millions of people are rising up to make steel. Take Beijing as an example. No matter which street or alley you walk on, you will hear exciting conversations about steelmaking. Elementary school students, after school, form groups and happily look for scrap iron to prepare materials for steelmaking. As soon as the general branch secretary of our Writers Association conveyed the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, everyone immediately requested to make steel. If they didn't know how, they would learn; if they couldn't make it, they would try again. Those who had always held pens happily picked up iron rods for stir-frying steel, put on work aprons, and went to the front of the roaring fire to make steel together with everyone. The wise Party has increasingly strengthened the unity of the people of the whole country, so that everyone can be of one mind, and respond happily as soon as there is a call. This is a remarkable thing, and it is something that has never happened in history. This is the unparalleled power emitted by our 600 million Chinese people united around the Party. The era when imperialism ridiculed us as a sheet of loose sand is gone forever. The early completion of 10.7 million tons of steel is due to the most important and fundamental factor: the wise leadership of the Party.

    Let the imperialists change from ridicule to trembling! Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will continue to achieve victories greater than the last. The completion of 10.7 million tons of steel is just the beginning.

    更大胜利的开端 
    艾芜
    一听见今年1070万吨钢的任务，已经提前完成，真是叫人欢喜异常。这就像前线送来一个大胜的消息，又像听见一支万人合唱的欢乐的歌曲。
    今年党中央和毛主席发出伟大的号召，要把去年535万吨钢翻一番，订成1070万吨的时候，真是人人振奋，个个鼓舞。当时我们就充分相信这个光荣任务一定能够完成，而且会提前完成。因为党中央和毛主席订的政策、发出的号召一向是根据马克思列宁主义和中国的现实相结合，非常坚实可靠，而又是跃进，所向无前的。同时又是启发群众，能让群众发挥无穷无尽的智慧和力量。像炼钢要土洋并举，大中小并举，就是极其英明的指示。一方面大量发展世界上最新的炼钢工业，一方面又把几千年来，我们祖宗炼钢的传统方法发扬光大起来，使人人可以成为炼钢能手。1952年春天，我第一次到鞍山的晚上，看见十里灯光辉煌，火光烛天，不禁为我们新工业的辉煌景象感到惊喜。而今天全国各地的晚上，又哪里没有土炉之群，发出映天的红光，叫人鼓舞呢？1956年夏天，我再到鞍山去的时候，就看见正在为新的炼钢厂房用羊角碾平整基地，第一炼钢厂的优秀工程师和干部，已经抽调出来，专门设计新的炼钢设备，他们欢喜地告诉我说：我们将会有很大的平炉了。1958年终于显出大型平炉的威力。而新的平炉之王，还要陆续地建成。这都表明我们的党，自建国以来，就对炼钢工业有着深远宏大的计划，而且无时无刻不在大力推行。今年1070万吨钢的提前完成，各个钢铁基地是起着重要的作用的。
    另外起重要作用的，是成千成万的人民群起炼钢。就以北京来说，不论走在哪条街哪条胡同，都会听见关于炼钢的兴奋的谈话。小学生放学出来，便成群结队，欢欢喜喜，找寻废铁，为炼钢准备材料。我们作家协会的总支书记，一传达了党中央和毛主席的号召，大家立即要求炼钢，不会就学，炼不成再炼。一向拿笔的人，都欢欣鼓舞地拿起炒钢的铁棍，围起工作裙子，走到熊熊大火的炉前和大家共同炼钢。英明的党已把全国人民日益坚强地团结起来，使大家能够万众一心，一有号召，就欢天喜地的响应。这是了不起的事情，也是历史上从来没有过的事情。这是我们六万万中国人在党的周围团结起来，发出了无比的威力。帝国主义嘲笑为一盘散沙的时代，永远一去不复返了。1070万吨钢的提前完成，党的英明的领导，是最重要最根本的因素。
    就让帝国主义由嘲笑而变为发抖吧！在党和毛主席的领导下，我们将继续取得一个比一个大的胜利。1070万吨钢的完成，只是一个开端。
