Concurrent Development of Industry and Agriculture Brings Many Benefits

After the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was published, the reporter, braving the swirling snowflakes, visited Mo Rigece, a representative of the "Eighth National Congress" of the Chinese Communist Party and the director of the China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Zhalait Banner, Inner Mongolia. He was reading the newspaper containing the communique at the time.

Mo Rigece said: The main indicators of national economic development for 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session are realistic. They reflect the demands of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. As long as we exert our energy, work hard, work practically, and work cleverly, we will definitely be able to overfulfill all tasks. Then he excitedly told the reporter: "In order to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session, our commune has formulated a guarantee plan for 1959."

The China-Soviet Friendship People's Commune, led by Mo Rigece, is located in the northwest of Zhalait Banner, a high-altitude hilly area with barren soil and serious water and drought disasters. Due to the large land area and small population, the farming has always been rough and shallow, with extensive planting and low yields, so the yield per unit area is only about 180 catties. During the Great Leap Forward this year, the grain yield per unit area increased by nearly doubled compared to last year. Speaking of this, he said that next year's production increase measures will be more effective than this year's, and 150,000 to 200,000 catties of fertilizer will be applied in next year's satellite fields, and 50,000 catties of fertilizer will be applied in basic farmland. Mo Rigece also introduced the industrial and animal husbandry production of his commune with a satisfied expression. In terms of animal husbandry, the net increase of large livestock this year was 30%, and the net increase of small livestock was 84%. The commune's industry has also made preliminary progress. Now the whole commune has 13 factories for iron smelting, iron and wood, brick and tile, fur, and sewing, with more than 150 workers. The entire commune is forming an economic system combining industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry.

Mo Rigece said that the establishment and development of the commune's industry has brought us many benefits. In the past, the purchase of production tools such as shovels, hoes, and carts had to rely on urban supplies. Now the commune's factories can meet most of the needs within the commune. The iron used in the iron and wood factory is produced by our own smelting plant, which saves money and is convenient. Implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is a good way to develop the commune's economy at a high speed. When recalling the road traveled this year, Mo Rigece said meaningfully that any undertaking has difficulties. When the Party proposed that rural areas should also run industries, many people dared not imagine that farmers could run industries. However, after liberating our minds and boldly setting up factories, many industrial products were manufactured, and industrial and technical talents also grew up.

    工农业并举好处多
    中共八届六中全会公报发表后，记者冒着纷飞雪花，访问了中国共产党“八大”代表、内蒙古扎赉特旗中苏友好人民公社主任莫日格策，当时他正在阅读载有公报的报纸。
    莫日格策说：六中全会提出的1959年国民经济发展的一些主要指标是实事求是的。它反映了我国各族人民的要求，只要我们鼓足干劲，苦干、实干、巧干，一定能够超额完成各项任务。接着他兴奋地告诉记者：“为了保证实现六中全会提出的跃进计划，我们公社已拟制了1959年的保证计划。”
    莫日格策领导的中苏友好人民公社，在扎赉特旗西北部，是一个高寒丘陵山区，土质瘠薄，水旱灾害严重。这里因地多人少，历来就粗耕浅作、广种薄收，因此单位面积产量只一百八十斤左右。在今年大跃进中，粮食单位产量平均比去年增加将近一倍。谈到这里，他说，明年的增产措施比今年更有力，明年的卫星田内将要施肥十五万到二十万斤，在基本农田中施肥五万斤。莫日格策还以满意的神情介绍了自己社的工业和牧业生产情况。在牧业方面，今年大畜纯增30％，小畜纯增84％。公社的工业也有了初步发展，现在全社有炼铁、铁木、砖瓦、皮毛、缝纫等工厂十三个，工人达到一百五十多人。整个公社正在形成为一个工、农、牧、林相结合的经济体系。
    莫日格策说公社工业的建立和发展，给我们带来许多好处，过去买锹、镐、车马等生产工具都得依靠城镇供应，现在公社的工厂就可以满足社内绝大部分需要了。铁木工厂用的铁是我们自己冶炼厂生产出来的铁，既省钱又方便。实行工业与农业同时并举，真是高速度发展公社经济的好门路。当回忆到今年所走过的路的时候，莫日格策意味深长地说，任何一种事业都是有困难的。当党提出农村也要办工业时，许多人不敢设想农民能办工业。可是经过解放思想，大胆地办起工厂后，许多工业产品制造出来了，工业技术人材也成长起来了。
