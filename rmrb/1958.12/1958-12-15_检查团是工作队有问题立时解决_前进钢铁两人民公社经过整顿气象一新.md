    Inspection Teams Act as Work Teams, Solving Problems Immediately: The Qianjin and Gangtie People's Communes Undergo Rectification and Present a Fresh Outlook

    (Our Report) The Party Committee of the Qianjin People's Commune in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, vigorously mobilized cadres and the masses to conduct a mass-based comprehensive inspection of the commune's current production, collective life, and financial expenditures. Problems were solved promptly as they were discovered during the inspection, giving the entire commune a completely new look.
    This commune, with 7,147 households and a population of over 23,700, was established in early October. Since its establishment, the commune has witnessed a leap in industrial and agricultural production, further improvement in the lives of its members, and a fundamental change in the people's mental outlook. However, as the People's Commune had only recently been established, the ideological awareness of a small number of cadres and the masses had not yet caught up, and some systems were not perfect. Therefore, some problems still existed in all aspects. In this comprehensive mass inspection, two major problems were first discovered in agricultural production. One was that the tasks of harvesting and planting had not yet been completed. As of November 28th, only 28% of the over 20,000 mu of autumn harvests, such as soybeans, sweet potatoes, and buckwheat, had been gathered, and only 22% of the over 20,000 mu of winter crops, such as rapeseed, wheat, green manure, and vegetables, had been planted. The other was that the harvesting and planting were carried out carelessly, and the winter crops planted did not fully meet the standards of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production. The autumn harvests had also not been collected with sufficient care. As a result, many people complained, "A bumper harvest, but only half harvested and half lost." Some said that this year's harvest was truly unprecedented, but it was a shame that "people only harvested half, and the land only yielded half." In response to this situation, the commune's Party committee immediately took measures, with the secretary taking the lead. The entire population was mobilized, and the inspection team divided up the work and took responsibility for specific areas, organizing the masses to work around the clock for five days and nights. By December 3rd, the tasks of harvesting and planting were completed, and a supplementary effort was made to improve the quality of crops that had already been harvested and planted but did not meet standards.
    While inspecting current production, a detailed inspection was also conducted on the collective life of commune members and public welfare undertakings. Through the inspection, it was discovered that all 210 public canteens, 210 nurseries, 10 kindergartens, 10 Homes of Happiness, and other welfare undertakings in the commune still had some problems. For example, the staff of canteens and nurseries had previously only emphasized saving labor, and all used semi-laborers and elderly women as cooks and childcare workers. Through this inspection, these personnel were adjusted, and politically reliable chefs with cooking experience and commune members with good hygiene habits were selected to work in the canteens. It was stipulated that canteens should not only provide commune members with hot and tasty meals on time but also provide hot water in a timely manner and open bathhouses. Reliable young and middle-aged women were also selected to serve as childcare workers in the nurseries, generally those with experience in raising children, good hygiene habits, and no infectious diseases. Kindergartens and Homes of Happiness were moved to houses with better sunlight and air, and the rooms were whitewashed. The inspection also found that winter epidemics were relatively serious, and many commune members were unable to work due to illness, and some children had measles. After discovering this situation, the inspection team immediately organized all medical personnel and the broad masses to carry out prevention, treatment, and isolation, so that more than 300 patients in the commune basically recovered, and the spread of the disease was stopped. During the inspection, welfare processing plants were also expanded to solve the needs of commune members for shoes, socks, and rain gear for the winter. The processing plants have now produced a large number of cloth shoes, straw sandals, cotton socks, umbrellas, rain hats, straw cloaks, and combs needed by female commune members. Ten additional service organizations such as sewing, barbering, and cotton fluffing were added. In order to further strengthen the leadership of the welfare undertaking, the commune Party committee decided that Secretary Yang Tingyou would be in charge, and the brigades would have the deputy branch secretaries specifically in charge of welfare. Each collective welfare unit elected a management committee through the masses to conscientiously implement the democratic management system.
    In order to further consolidate and improve the People's Commune, the inspection team also conducted a comprehensive inspection of the commune's previous expenditures. The inspection revealed that the expenditure problems were significant, and some cadres lacked a sufficient understanding of running the commune diligently and thriftily. They unilaterally emphasized showing the superiority of socialism, putting on a big show, building office buildings, and buying bicycles. In October alone, the commune spent more than 2,400 yuan to buy 16 bicycles, proposing "bicycle-izing transportation," and planned to spend more than 8,000 yuan to build 40 office rooms. Through this accounting inspection, non-productive expenditures reached 40%. After discovering this serious problem, twelve of the sixteen bicycles that had been purchased were sold, the office building under construction was halted, and an expenditure system was established. The broad masses of commune members warmly supported these measures. Previously, every bit of expenditure had to be paid for by the commune. Now, production and welfare undertakings are fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses themselves, reducing non-productive expenditures and increasing the commune's income. In November alone, the commune's various sideline incomes reached more than 21,000 yuan. Now, a new atmosphere has emerged in the commune's production and life. Through this comprehensive inspection, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of cadres and the masses has also been greatly improved. (Huang Shengpu)

    (Our Report) The Gangtie People's Commune's Eighth Brigade in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, achieved great success by promoting democracy in the winter production inspection.
    The inspection was conducted based on the opinions of the commune members. The inspection team, carrying hoes and bamboo baskets, went deep into the fields. Wherever they went, they absorbed commune members to participate in the inspection work, explaining the agricultural production plans and measures for the coming year while observing. When problems were discovered, they discussed them with the masses and resolved them on the spot. When they arrived at places where production had increased more or less this year, they studied the reasons with the commune members, looked at the lessons learned, and discussed what to do next year. In this way, the problems were discovered deeply and resolved quickly and thoroughly.
    The inspection team arrived at Huangpo Chong and found that the drainage ditches in a portion of the green manure field managed by Gong Guozhou were not well cleared, and there was a lot of waterlogging in the field, and the green manure grew yellow and thin. The inspection team consulted with the cadres of this small team and immediately sent two commune members to clear the ditches and drain the waterlogging. The inspection team came to Liujiaban and Zhushan Dalong to inspect deep plowing. They saw that the fields plowed by commune member Liu Jiefu were all more than 1.5 chi deep, while the fields plowed by commune member Gong Guizhou were only 3 or 4 cun deep. They convened a meeting of 30 to 40 commune members working nearby and asked them to discuss whether or not deep plowing was necessary and what the benefits of deep plowing were. During the discussion, some people said that based on the fields of Liujiaban, deep plowing was necessary. In the past, the mud feet of the fields of Liujiaban were very shallow, and they could not be plowed more than 3 or 4 cun deep, and the average yield per mu was only 300 jin per year. During the Great Leap Forward in production last winter, the commune members worked hard for ten days and ten nights and generally added 5 cun of soil, and this year the average yield per mu reached 3,200 jin. This ironclad fact shows that production cannot be increased without deep plowing. After everyone understood this principle, they all proposed that deep plowing was necessary and that land that had not been deep plowed should be reworked. They also wrote big-character posters and published blackboard newspapers praising Liu Jiefu's model actions in deep plowing and criticized Gong Guizhou's mistaken behavior of not thinking about increasing production for the commune. Because the inspection team listened to the opinions of the masses everywhere in their work, adopted the method of reasoning, and consulted with the masses, the masses had a high enthusiasm for production.
    At present, winter crops have generally been cultivated and fertilized once to three times; more than 400 mu of land that should be turned over have been turned over, and the depth is more than 1.5 chi; an average of more than 1,700 dan of fertilizer has been accumulated per mu, and a chemical fertilizer plant has been built to produce more than 15,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer. Winter production is being carried out in depth.

    检查团是工作队有问题立时解决
    前进钢铁两人民公社经过整顿气象一新
    本报讯  湖南省衡南县前进人民公社党委会，大力发动干部和群众，对公社的当前生产、集体生活和财政开支等问题，进行了群众性的全面大检查。在检查中，发现问题就及时解决，使整个公社面貌焕然一新。
    这个拥有七千一百四十七户二万三千七百多人的公社是在10月初建立的。自公社成立以后，工农业生产都有了飞跃的发展，社员生活也有了进一步提高，人们的精神面貌发生了根本变化。但是由于人民公社刚刚成立不久，少数干部和群众的思想觉悟还跟不上，有些制度不够健全。所以各方面都还存在一些问题。在这次全民大检查中，首先发现在农业生产方面还存在两个重要问题，一个是抢收抢种任务还没有完成。到11月28日止，全公社应收的二万多亩秋大豆、红薯、荞麦等秋收作物还只收了28％；该种的二万多亩油菜、麦子、绿肥、蔬菜等冬季作物也还只种下22％。另一个是抢收抢种工夫粗放，种下的冬季作物还没有完全符合农业生产八条“宪法”的标准，已收的秋收作物也没有达到细收细打的要求。因此很多群众反映说：“丰收丰收，半收半丢”。有的说今年丰收确是从来没有的，就是不该“人收一半，地收一半”。根据这一情况，社党委立即采取措施，由书记挂帅，全动民手，检查团分片包干，组织群众突击五昼夜，到12月3日，抢收抢种任务全部完成，并对原来已经收完种下但是不合质量的进行了一次补课。
    在检查当前生产的同时，对社员的集体生活和公共福利事业也进行了一次细致的检查，通过检查，发现全公社二百一十个公共食堂、二百一十个托儿所和十个幼儿园、十个幸福院以及其他福利事业，都还多多少少存在一些问题，比如食堂、托儿所的工作人员，原来只片面强调节省劳力，全用半劳力和老年妇女充当炊事员和保育员，通过这次检查，对这些人员进行了调整，选派政治可靠、有做菜经验的厨师和平常有卫生习惯的社员到食堂去工作，规定食堂除了按时供给社员可口的热菜热饭以外，还及时供给热水开水，并开设洗澡堂。托儿所的保育员也换上了一批可靠的青壮年妇女去担任工作，一般都是选出有带孩子的经验、讲究卫生、无传染病的人。幼儿园和幸福院都搬到阳光和空气较好的房子里，房间都进行了粉刷。在这次检查中还发现冬季流行的疾病也较严重，不少社员因病不能出工，有些小孩出麻疹，检查团发现这情况以后立即组织全体医务人员和广大群众一道进行预防、治疗和隔离，使全社三百多个病号基本好转，并制止了蔓延现象。检查中并扩大福利加工厂，解决社员过冬需要的鞋袜、雨具等用品，现在加工厂已经做出了大批布鞋、草鞋、棉袜、雨伞、斗笠、蓑衣和女社员需要的梳篦，并且增了十处缝衣、理发、弹花等服务性的机构。为了进一步加强生活福利事业的领导，公社党委确定书记杨廷佑同志专管，大队都由副支书具体抓生活福利事业，各个集体生活福利单位都通过群众选出管理委员会，认真地执行民主管理制度。
    为了进一步巩固和提高人民公社，这次检查团还对整个公社前段开支情况进行了一次全面检查，通过检查发现开支问题很大，个别干部对勤俭办社的认识不足，他们片面强调显示社会主义优越性，大摆排场，修建办公楼，买自行车，仅10月份全公社就花了二千四百多元买了十六部自行车，提出什么“行路自行车化”，并计划拿出八千多元修建四十间办公楼房。通过这次检查算账，非生产性开支达到40％。检查中发现这一严重问题以后，把已买的十六部自行车卖了十二部，正在进行修建的办公楼停止修建，并确定了开支制度。广大社员热烈拥护这些措施。原来一点一滴都要公社开支，现在搞生产，办福利事业都是充分发动群众依靠群众自己办理，减少非生产性的开支，增加了公社的收入，光是11月份社里的各项副业收入就达二万一千多元。现在全公社的生产生活都出现了新气象，通过这次全面检查，广大干部和群众的思想觉悟也有了大大的提高。  （黄生谱）
    本报讯  湖南临湘县钢铁人民公社八百大队，在冬季生产大检查中，发扬民主，收到很大成绩。
    检查是根据社员的意见进行的。检查组拿着锄头、背着竹畚箕，深入到田间。每到一处，便吸收社员参加检查工作，边看边向社员宣传明年的农业生产计划和措施；发现了问题，就同群众一道商量，就地解决。到了今年增产比较多或者比较少的地方，就同社员一块研究原因，看看有哪些经验教训，明年该怎么办为好。这样一来，问题既发现得深，解决得也快也透彻。
    检查组来到了黄婆冲，发现龚国洲管理的一部分绿肥田，沟没有清好，田里渍水很多，绿肥长得又黄又瘦。检查组便同这个小队的干部商量，立即派了两个社员清好沟，排除了渍水。检查组来到柳家畈和竹山大垅检查深耕情况，看到社员刘界夫犁的田，深度都在一尺五以上，而社员龚贵洲犁的田，只有三、四寸深。便召开在附近劳动的三、四十个社员开了一个现场会，提出要不要深耕，深耕有哪些好处等问题让大家讨论。讨论中，有人说从柳家畈的田看，就一定要深耕。柳家畈田过去泥脚很浅，犁不过三、四寸深，年年亩产不过三百斤；去年冬天生产大跃进，社员们苦战了十天十晚，普遍加了五寸厚的土，今年平均亩产达到三千二百斤。这个铁的事实说明：要增产非深耕不行。大家弄清了这个道理之后，纷纷提出一定要深耕，没有深耕的土地要返工。并写大字报、出黑板报表扬刘界夫深耕搞得好的爱社模范行动，批评了龚贵洲不为社里增产着想的错误行为。由于检查组在工作中处处倾听群众意见，采取说理的办法，同群众商量办事，群众生产干劲很高。
    目前，冬季作物已普遍中耕施肥一次到三次；四百多亩该翻的田都已翻转来了，深度也都在一尺五寸以上；每亩平均已积肥一千七百多担，自建了化肥厂，制出土化肥一万五千多斤。冬季生产正在深入地开展着。
