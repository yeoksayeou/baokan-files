Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Women are showing their talents in developing collective living and welfare undertakings, making outstanding achievements, and diligently serving production and the people. Today, at the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, representatives proudly reported their achievements in vigorously running collective living and welfare undertakings. These excellent people's cooks' speeches were warmly welcomed.

	Chen Qimei, a cook from the Red Flag People's Commune in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, focused on how they used their brains to diversify meals and ensure everyone ate well and was full. Their canteen had made twenty-three different kinds of food alone. During the recent autumn harvest and winter planting season, commune members ate four meals a day, and each meal was different. On days to improve living standards, there were even more varieties, including noodles, steamed buns, sweet potato cakes, sorghum pancakes, wontons, vegetable buns, and meat buns. The canteen made soft and fine food especially for the elderly and children. They also took good care of sick commune members and new mothers, providing all the food needed by new mothers, cooked and delivered to their door.

	Today, seven excellent people's cooks spoke at the conference. Because of their wholehearted contributions to the canteen work, they have gained the trust and respect of the masses. Liang Shaomin, Director of the Huaiyin Special District Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Federation, introduced the public canteen run by women of the Lianmeng Brigade of the Lianmeng Commune in Huaian County. This canteen usually has two dishes, cold dishes and pickles for breakfast and dinner, a small amount of meat every three days, and meat or fish once a week, with an extra bowl of soup for the elderly. These canteens not only make good food, ensuring that commune members are full and eat well, but also make commune members feel very convenient. Even if commune members have guests during meal times, the canteen will find ways to add dishes for the guests. Women also deliver meals to the fields during the busy farming season. There is also a water-boiling stove in the canteen, so commune members can drink boiled water at any time. This public canteen is called "a red flag of socialism."

	In the speeches of Xiong Huifang, a cook from the Binjiang People's Commune in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province; Dongwa Kacuo, a cook from the Beishan People's Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province; Qin Yueying, a representative from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Yi Xiuying, a cook from the Gaofeng Brigade of the Junshan People's Commune in Yueyang County, Hunan Province; and Xu Ying, a representative from the Fulu Street 302 Alley Canteen in Yulin District, Shanghai, they all expressed their determination to run the canteen even better, making the dishes delicious and satisfying everyone. Xiong Huifang, a cook from the Binjiang People's Commune in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, said in her speech: "I guarantee to listen to the Party and be an excellent people's cook." Xiong Huifang was a little unwilling when she started cooking, but then she thought that in socialist construction, the work of a cook is also glorious, so she settled down to do it. The canteen she runs opens in four batches according to the production and work of more than 100 people, meeting the needs of the masses. In her speech, she said that she will actively study her profession and become an expert in cooking.

	Many women have promoted the spirit of daring to think and act for the mechanization of canteens, and have made many inventions. Female workers of the Capital Machinery Factory, for the mechanization of the canteen, after a month of hard work and ingenuity, made the "Capital Women's No. 1 Combined Noodle Making Machine." This machine only needs to be turned on for two hours to make steamed buns for about 12,000 people. In the manufacturing process, they encountered many difficulties, but they were determined and not intimidated by the difficulties. For example, there was no general assembly drawing during the general assembly, so the female workers drew it themselves. Due to lack of experience, the drawings were not accurate enough, and the parts made were not coordinated with each other, causing the machine parts to be reworked many times, and some parts were reworked as many as fifteen times. After hard work, the female workers finally completed the general assembly and successfully trial-produced this machine. Wang Shengdai, a female worker from the Capital Machinery Factory, introduced the process of manufacturing the combined noodle making machine at the meeting and assured the conference: we will not be arrogant or complacent, we will always move forward, and we are determined to make greater contributions in various technical innovations.

	Xia Gengfang, Liu Yuxian, Jiao Zengxue, Wu Liumei and other four women activists from commercial, service and medical departments, in their speeches at the conference, showed that many women in these jobs have established the lofty idea of diligently serving production and the masses. Xia Gengfang dared to think and act, managing the Chongqing Jiangbei Gailanxi Bridge non-staple food store alone. With the cooperation and assistance of workers in nearby barbershops and employees of factory and school mess halls, the variety of goods managed by the past two people increased from more than 100 to 400 or 500, and the monthly turnover increased from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to more than 11,000 yuan. More than 20 kinds of slow-selling goods accumulated in the past were all sold out, and errors were eliminated. Nearby people and food groups are also very satisfied. Jiao Zengxue, a representative of the Shanghai Second Medical College Affiliated Guangci Hospital rescue team for Qiu Caikang and Zang Hexing, vividly reported the process of rescuing steel hero Qiu Caikang. She said: "Our hospital's nursing staff will always hold high the red flag of rescuing Qiu Caikang and contribute our life's energy to the socialist and communist cause." Wu Liumei, a representative from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that their township-run rural maternity hospital has left a very good impression among the masses since its establishment. For example, in Leilong Village in the second half of this year, out of 33 pregnant women, except for 5 who did not have time to enter the hospital, the remaining 28 all safely gave birth to children in the maternity hospital. They usually care about the pregnant women very much. Wu Liumei often goes to the pregnant women's homes to help with housework, makes various nutritious products for the pregnant women, and brings the children that the pregnant women cannot take care of to sleep with her. Sometimes two children sleep together, and there are not enough quilts. She would rather cover less herself than let the children freeze. When the child cries at night, she gets up to hold him and coax him. The people in the pregnant woman's family are grateful and say: "The maternity hospital is better than our own home." Liu Yuxian, the director of the Kaiyuan Chengguan Town Sewing Factory in Gejiu City, Yunnan Province, introduced that in order to facilitate the masses, their factory organized skilled workers to bring machines to the countryside to sew clothes for farmers, and added retail stores and service points in the city, which has been well received by customers.

	Today, ten female activists from the industrial front also reported their achievements in steel, geology, construction and other aspects at the conference. They are: Liu Xirong and Li Suqin, representatives from Henan Province; Cui Guiying, a representative from Hebei Province; Xue Mingjie, a representative from Heilongjiang Province; Chen Zhiqin, a representative from Zhejiang Province; Huang Yinggui, a representative from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; Li Huifen, a representative from Qinghai Province; Bai Suyun, a representative from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; Li Anmujie, a representative of the Kawa nationality from Yunnan Province; and Dong Shuzhen, a representative from Liaoning Province. Liu Xirong, Director of the Yuxian County Women's Federation in Henan, said: In the previous period, 54.4% of the female labor force in Yuxian County participated in the steel army. In addition to building factories and furnaces with men, they also independently established 27 women's steelmaking plants and 3,900 women's furnaces. Not only did they smelt iron, but 8,664 people were trained as technicians in steel production, and many people were named heroes and models. Huang Yinggui, a representative from Guangxi, said that the 230 Zhuang women in their Tuokan Commune not only ate well and had good recreational activities in the battle of smelting iron and mining coal in the Nanling Iron and Steel Base, but also the leaders took care of their special needs in many ways. The regiment political commissar went to the barracks every night to visit them. Therefore, although their work is very intensive, they live very happily. Li Huifen, a representative of the "Zhao Yiman" Women's Team in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, said that they have grown from 12 people when they were established in early March this year to more than 300 people, becoming the vanguard of the petroleum industry. Li Huifen also said: They all have a common ideal - to build Qaidam into one of the heavy industrial bases of the motherland. Dong Shuzhen, Director of the Third Family Committee of Tiexin Street, Jintie District, Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, led the families of employees to set up an activated carbon factory under the conditions that there were no materials and equipment and no technical knowledge. Dong Shuzhen said in her speech that from the beginning of large-scale production in late August to the end of the year, their factory can produce seven tons of high-grade activated carbon, creating 15,400 yuan of wealth for the country. After the establishment of this factory, they also set up four factories such as linen embroidery and mica.

	At today's conference, Yan Bibo, Director of the Jixian County Women's Federation in Hebei Province, and Miao Hongting, Director of the Lanzhou City Women's Federation in Gansu Province, respectively introduced the situation in their local areas where a large number of women replaced men in the commercial and service systems in order to support the three marshals' ascension.

    妇女积极分子畅谈办好集体生活福利
    据新华社9日讯  妇女在兴办集体生活福利事业中大显身手，作出了出色的成绩，做到了勤勤恳恳地为生产服务、为人民服务。今天，全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上的发言中，代表们以自豪的心情报告了她们在大力办好集体生活福利事业中的成就。这些优秀的人民炊事员的发言，受到热烈欢迎。
    浙江省东阳县红旗人民公社炊事员陈七妹的发言着重地介绍了她们如何开动脑筋，使饭菜多样化，让大家吃得饱吃得好。她们办的食堂，仅在饭食方面就做过二十三样，最近秋收冬种时，社员一天吃四餐，餐餐饭食不一样。逢到改善生活的日子，花样就更多了，有面条、馒头、番薯糕、高梁饼、馄饨、菜包子、肉包子等。她办的食堂对老人、小孩专做软食、细食。对生病的社员、产妇也照顾得很周到，凡是产妇所需的饮食，全部是食堂做的，食堂还烧好了送上门。
    今天共有七位优秀的人民炊事员在会上发言。她们由于全心全意地在食堂工作上作出了贡献，得到了群众的信任和尊敬。江苏省妇联淮阴专区办事处主任梁少敏在会上介绍了淮安县联盟公社联盟大队妇女办的公共食堂。这个食堂平时都有两个菜、早晚有冷菜和酱菜，三天一小荤，每星期可以吃到一次肉或鱼，老人外加一碗汤。这些食堂不但饭菜做得好，使社员吃得饱吃得好，而且使社员们感到很方便，即使社员们在开饭时来了客人，食堂也会想出办法为客人加菜。妇女们在农忙季节还把饭菜送到田间。食堂里还有老虎灶，社员随时可以喝到开水。这个公共食堂被称为“社会主义的一面红旗”。
    在黑龙江哈尔滨市滨江人民公社炊事员熊惠芳、青海省互助土族自治县北山人民公社炊事员东娃卡措、广西僮族自治区代表覃月英、湖南省岳阳县君山人民公社高丰大队炊事员易秀英、上海市榆林区福禄街三○二弄食堂代表徐英的发言中，还都表示了决心，保证今后把食堂办得更好，做到菜美饭香，人人满意。黑龙江哈尔滨市滨江人民公社炊事员熊惠芳在发言中说：“我保证听党的话，作一个优秀的人民炊事员”。熊惠芳开始做炊事工作时，有点不大乐意，但又想到在社会主义建设中，炊事员的工作也是光荣的，就安心做下去了。她办的食堂根据一百多人生产和工作的情况，分四批开饭，满足了群众的需要。她在发言中表示，今后积极钻研业务，做一个做饭的专家。
    有许多妇女为了食堂的机械化，发扬了敢想敢干的精神，有很多的发明创造。首都机械厂女工为了食堂机械化，经过一个月的苦干巧干，制成了“首都妇女一号联合制面机”。这个机器只须开动两小时，就可以做出约一万二千人吃的馒头。在制造过程中，她们遇到很多困难，可是她们决心大，没有被困难吓倒。如总装时没有总装配图，女工们就自己画。由于缺乏经验，画的图不够准确，做出的零件互不协调，造成机器零件屡次返工，有的零件返工达十五次之多。女工们经过艰苦奋斗，终于总装完成，试制成功这部机器。首都机械厂女工汪声黛在会上介绍了她们制造联合制面机的经过，并向大会保证：不骄不傲，永远前进，决心在各项技术革新中作出更大的贡献。
    来自商业、服务业和医务部门的妇女积极分子夏更芳、刘玉仙、敫增雪、吴六妹等四人在大会上发言中，说明了这些工作岗位上已有不少妇女已经建立了勤勤恳恳地为生产为群众服务的崇高思想。夏更芳敢想敢干，一人管理重庆市江北溉澜溪大桥副食品门市部，在附近理发店工人和工厂、学校伙食团职工的协作帮助下，经营的商品品种由过去两人管理时的一百多种增加到四、五百种，每月营业额由两三千元上升到一万一千多元，过去积存的二十多种滞销商品全部推销出去，而且消灭了差错，附近群众和伙食团体也很满意。上海第二医学院附属广慈医院挽救丘财康、臧呵兴护理小组的代表敫增雪，生动地报告了她们抢救钢铁英雄丘财康的经过，她说：“我们全院护理人员将永远高举起抢救丘财康的红旗，为社会主义和共产主义事业贡献出毕生的精力。”广西僮族自治区的代表吴六妹说，她们乡办的农村产院成立以来，在群众中留下了很好的印象。如蕾陇村今年下半年来，三十三个产妇除了五人来不及进院外，其余二十八人全部在产院安全地生下了小孩。她们平时对产妇非常关心，吴六妹就常常到产妇家去帮助料理家务，为产妇做各种营养品，把产妇照顾不了的小孩带来同自己一起睡，有时两个小孩同睡，被子少，宁可自己少盖一些也不让孩子冻着，晚上小孩啼哭，就起来抱他哄他。产妇家中的人都感激地说：“产院比自己的家还好。”云南省个旧市的开远城关镇缝纫厂主任刘玉仙介绍她们厂为了便利群众，一方面组织技术工人带机器下乡为农民缝衣服，一面在城市增设门市部和服务点，得到了顾客的好评。
    今天还有十名工业战线上的妇女积极分子在大会上汇报她们在钢铁、地质、建筑等方面的成就。她们是：河南省代表刘喜荣、李素琴，河北省代表崔桂英，黑龙江省代表薛明杰，浙江省代表陈芝琴，广西僮族自治区代表黄英桂，青海省代表李惠芬，宁夏回族自治区代表白素云，云南省代表、佧佤族的李安木戛，辽宁省代表董淑珍。河南禹县妇联主任刘喜荣说：禹县在前一时期有54.4％的妇女劳动力参加了钢铁大军，她们除了和男子一道建厂建炉以外，还单独建立妇女炼铁厂二十七个、妇女炉三千九百个，不仅炼出了铁，还有八千六百六十四人锻炼成为钢铁生产中的技术员，不少人被评为英雄模范。广西代表黄英桂说，她们驮堪公社二百三十个僮族妇女在南岭钢铁基地炼铁挖煤战斗中，不仅吃的好，文娱生活好，而且领导上多方照顾她们的特殊需要，团政委每天晚上都要到营房去探望她们。因此她们虽然劳动很紧张，但是生活却过的很愉快。青海柴达木盆地“赵一曼”女子队的代表李惠芬说，她们已由今年3月初成立时的十二人发展到三百多人，成为了石油工业的尖兵。李惠芬还说：她们都有个共同理想——要把柴达木建设成为祖国重工业基地之一。辽宁锦州市锦铁区铁新街第三家属委员会主任董淑珍，领导职工家属在什么物资设备也没有，什么技术也不懂的条件下，办起了活性炭工厂。董淑珍在发言中说，她们厂从8月末开始大量生产到年底，可以出产高级活性炭七吨，为国家创造一万五千四百元财富。在这个工厂建立以后，她们又办起了麻布抽绣、云母等四个工厂。
    在今天的大会上，还有河北省冀县妇联主任严碧波、甘肃省兰州市妇联主任苗鸿亭，分别介绍了她们当地为了支援三大元帅升帐，在商业、服务业等系统大量以女代男的工作情况。
