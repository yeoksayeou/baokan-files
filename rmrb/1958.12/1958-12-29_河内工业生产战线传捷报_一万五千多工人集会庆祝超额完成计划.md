Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 28th: Over 15,000 workers in Hanoi today warmly celebrated the fact that all state-owned and most private factories in Hanoi have completed and overfulfilled the 1958 national production plan ahead of schedule.

The staff and workers first gathered at the Grand Theater Square, listened to reports from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and leaders of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Labor Party on the achievements of Hanoi's industrial production, and then marched in the streets.

The marching crowd carried huge achievement boards, beat gongs and drums, danced lions, and excitedly shouted slogans such as "Long live the Labor Party!" "Dare to think, dare to do, advance rapidly!" Leading the procession was the first "Victory" brand sedan car recently successfully trial-produced in Vietnam.

This year is the best year for industrial production in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in the past four years. Thirty-five large and small factories and enterprises have completed and overfulfilled their production plans ahead of schedule. The factories with the best results have overfulfilled their plans by more than 50%.

Hanoi's industrial production will have even greater development next year, and about ten light industrial factories will be built next year.

Recently, when discussing and formulating next year's production plan, workers in many factories expressed their determination to "throw time far behind" and "break through the output targets three to five times higher than now."

    新华社河内28日电  河内一万五千多工人今天热烈庆祝河内全部国营和大部分私营工厂提前和超额完成了1958年国家生产计划。
    职工们首先在大戏院广场集会，听了全国总工会和劳动党河内市委会领导人关于河内工业生产成绩的报告，然后列队到街上游行。
    游行队伍抬着巨幅的成绩牌，敲锣打鼓，舞着狮子，兴奋地高呼
  “劳动党万岁！”“敢想、敢做，快步猛进！”等口号。走在队伍最前面的是越南最近试制成功的第一辆“战胜”牌小轿车。
    今年是越南民主共和国首都河内四年来工业生产成绩最好的一年。三十五个大小工厂企业提前和超额完成了生产计划。成绩最好的工厂超额完成计划50％以上。
    河内的工业生产明年还要有更大的发展，明年将建成约十个轻工业工厂。
    工人们最近在讨论制订明年生产计划的时候，许多工厂的工人表示决心“一定要把时间远远地抛在后面”，“一定要突破比现在多三倍到五倍的产量指标”。
