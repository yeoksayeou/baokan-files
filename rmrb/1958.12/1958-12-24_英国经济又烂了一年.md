Xinhua News Agency reporter Qian Xing:

    As 1959 approaches, the economic outlook for Britain appears even bleaker.

    In this year that is coming to an end, British production has decreased, unemployment has increased, and domestic and foreign markets have shrunk. As it welcomes the New Year, Britain's political and economic contradictions with all its major allies are becoming increasingly acute, and Commonwealth countries affected by the capitalist world economic crisis are also increasingly dissatisfied with Britain.

    At the very beginning of the New Year, the British economy will suffer its first major blow from the continent of Western Europe. Six Western European countries (West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) will implement their "Common Market" plan on January 1. This will threaten British exports to Western Europe, a market that usually accounts for one-seventh of Britain's export goods.

    If Britain is hit in Western Europe, it will have to turn more to Commonwealth countries to seek trade development. But in this region, traditionally linked to Britain, centrifugal forces are strongly at play. Commonwealth members have their own problems. For example, for raw material producing countries within the Commonwealth system, their purchasing power has also greatly declined due to the sharp decline in raw material prices caused by the capitalist world economic crisis. Therefore, even relatively developed Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand are currently imposing restrictions on the import of British goods. The reduction in the purchasing power of Commonwealth countries is already showing signs of harming British exports, and will become increasingly obvious in the New Year.

    To change this tendency of Commonwealth countries, Britain must take some emergency measures, such as increasing investment and loans to Commonwealth countries, but Britain does not have the strength to do so (at the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference held in Montreal in September this year, representatives of Commonwealth countries governments expressed great enthusiasm for the proposal to establish a Commonwealth Bank. But when the question of who would pay the money was raised, the proposal finally had to be abandoned). On the contrary, the monopoly capital of the United States and West Germany has replaced or infiltrated Britain's traditional sphere of influence in Canada, Australia, Pakistan, and South Africa. This has alarmed British monopoly capitalists.

    This is a rough picture of the external environment of the British economy. One-third of Britain's total industrial products are exported, and the difficulties in the external environment cannot but have an increasingly adverse impact on British domestic production.

    In the year that is about to pass, British industrial production has been declining continuously, unlike in previous years when it was only in a state of stagnation. Official figures show that since the second quarter of this year, the decline in British industrial production has been increasing. Compared with the same period last year, from May to July this year, the total value of British industrial production decreased by 2.5% to 3%, 4% in August, 4.5% in September, and 16% in November.

    The decline in British industrial production has spread to all major sectors. From January to November this year, steel production was 18 million tons, a decrease of 10.4% compared with the same period last year. Iron production from January to October this year was 10.9 million tons, a decrease of 9.2% compared with the same period last year. Coal production from January to December this year was 208.7 million tons, a decrease of 3.8% compared with last year.

    Britain's shipbuilding industry production is now far behind Japan. And West Germany is closely following behind Britain, threatening Britain's position as the world's second largest. The "Financial Times" predicts that the shipbuilding industry may be worse in 1959 than in 1958.

    In the machine tool industry, total orders have fallen below 60 million pounds, which is less than three-quarters of the previous year's total.

    The textile industry is currently in a serious crisis. In the third quarter of this year, cotton yarn production decreased by 16% compared with the same period last year, sales decreased by 30%, and exports decreased by more than 33%.

    Compared with other declining industries, the automobile industry can be said to be an exception. This year, approximately one million cars were produced, and it is an industry that earns foreign exchange in foreign trade. However, due to reduced exports to Commonwealth and Western European countries, automobile production also declined in November. In the New Year, the establishment of the Western European "Common Market" and the increased competition in the American automobile industry will undoubtedly have a significant impact on British automobile exports.

    The number of registered unemployed in Britain in mid-November has reached 575,000, the highest figure in eighteen years, and it is still increasing.

    Since Britain now has 10%-30% of its industrial production capacity idle, the Ministry of Trade estimates that manufacturing expenditure on fixed capital next year will be one-sixth less than this year. Expenditure on the construction of factories and mines by private industry is likely to decrease by as much as 25%.

    Britain's situation of declining production has a great tendency to develop into a profound crisis. The measures currently taken by the British government to reduce export and production difficulties are: first, to repeatedly propose compromise proposals, trying its best to make some arrangements with the Western European "Common Market" in order to preserve this important market.

    Second, to continue to beg the United States for "aid," attempting to use this to try its best to control Commonwealth countries and maintain the stability of the pound.

    Third, to take measures of monetary reflation domestically, including reducing bank interest rates, relaxing installment purchase restrictions, and increasing government investment in certain state-owned industries.

    But now the chances of successful talks with "Common Market" countries seem dimmer than ever. Begging the United States for "aid" has also been met with a cold reception. The British government's wishful thinking of obtaining financial support from the United States without leading to further penetration of British spheres of influence by American capital is of no interest to the United States. And taking measures of monetary reflation domestically can only produce extremely limited and short-term effects, and is like drinking poison to quench thirst.

    Faced with a bleak New Year, many British bourgeois newspapers are deeply concerned. The "Financial Times" admitted in an editorial on December 20 that the British economy next year will be shrouded in "a lot of dark clouds."

### 英国经济又烂了一年

    英国经济又烂了一年
    ·新华社记者  钱行·
    当1959年快要到来的时候，英国的经济前景看来更加黯淡了。
    在这快要结束的一年里，英国生产减少、失业增加、国内外市场萎缩。在迎接新年的时候，英国同它的一切主要盟国的政治矛盾和经济矛盾越来越尖锐，受到资本主义世界经济危机影响的英联邦国家对英国也越来越不满了。
    新年一开始，英国经济就将从西欧大陆受到第一个巨大打击。六个西欧国家（西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡）将在1月1日执行它们的“共同市场”计划。这将威胁到英国对西欧的输出，而通常英国的出口商品有七分之一是输往西欧这个市场的。
    英国在西欧遭到打击，它就不得不更多地转向英联邦国家寻求发展贸易。但是在这个历来同英国联在一起的地区，离心力量正在强烈地发生作用。英联邦成员国有它们自己的问题。例如对于英联邦系统内的原料生产国家说来，由于资本主义世界经济危机造成的原料价格急剧下降，它们的购买力也大大下降了。因此目前甚至像澳大利亚和新西兰这种经济比较发达的英联邦国家，也对英国货的进口实行限制。英联邦国家购买力的降低对英国商品输出的害处目前已见端倪，在新的一年中将变得日益明显。
    英国要改变英联邦国家的这种倾向，就必须采取一些紧急措施，例如对英联邦国家增加投资和贷款，但是在这一点上英国是心有余而力不足的（在今年9月在蒙特利尔举行的英联邦贸易和经济会议上，英联邦国家政府的代表们对于建立英联邦银行的主张表示了很大的热情。但是当谁出钱的问题提出来的时候，这个主张终于不得不扔掉了）。相反，美国和西德的垄断资本已经代替了或者渗入了英国在加拿大、澳大利亚、巴基斯坦和南非的传统势力范围。这使英国垄断资本家十分惊慌。
    这就是英国经济的外部环境的大致情况。英国的全部工业产品中有三分之一是输出国外的，外部环境的困难不能不对英国国内生产发生越来越不利的影响。
    在即将过去的一年中，英国的工业生产已经不断下降，不像前几年还只是处于呆滞状态。官方数字说明，从今年第二季开始，英国工业生产下降的幅度越来越大。同去年同期相比，从今年5月到7月，英国工业生产总值下降了2.5％到3％，8月份下降了4％，9月份下降了4.5％，而11月份下降了16％。
    英国工业生产的下降遍及各个主要部门。今年1月到11月钢产量是一千八百万吨，比去年同期减少10.4％。铁的生产在今年1月到10月为一千零九十万吨，比去年同期减少9.2％。今年1月到12月煤产量为二亿零八百七十万吨，比去年减少3.8％。
    英国的造船工业生产量现在已大大落后于日本。而西德也紧随在英国后面，威胁着英国的世界第二位的地位。“金融时报”预测，造船工业在1959年可能比1958年更糟。
    在工作母机工业方面，总的订货量降到了六千万英镑以下，这个数目还抵不到以前全年总数的四分之三。
    纺织工业目前处在严重的危机中。今年第三季度，棉纱产量比去年同期减少16％，销售量减少30％，出口减少33％以上。
    同其他走下坡路的工业相比，汽车工业可说是例外。今年大约生产了一百万辆汽车，它是在对外贸易中赢得外汇的工业。但是由于对英联邦和西欧国家出口减少，11月份汽车产量也下降了。在新的一年中，西欧“共同市场”的成立和美国汽车工业的加强竞争，无疑将使英国汽车的出口受到重大影响。
    11月月中英国登记的失业人数已达五十七万五千人，这是十八年来最高的数字，而且仍在继续增加中。
    由于英国现在已经有10％—30％的工业生产能力闲置不用，据贸易部估计，制造业明年在固定资本方面的开支要比今年减少六分之一。私营工业修建厂矿的开支大概要减少25％之多。
    英国这种生产下降的情况大有发展为深刻的危机的趋势。英国政府目前为了减少出口和生产的困难而采取的措施是：第一，接二连三地提出妥协的建议，尽力企图同西欧“共同市场”作出某种安排，以保全这个重要市场。
    第二，继续乞求美国“援助”，企图以此来尽力控制英联邦国家和维持英镑稳定。
    第三，在国内采取通货再膨胀的措施，包括减低银行利率、放宽赊购限制和增加政府对某些国有工业的投资。
    但是现在看来同“共同市场”国家会谈成功的机会比任何时候都更黯淡。乞求美国“援助”也受到了冷遇。英国政府希望取得美国的财政支援而又不导致美国资本进一步渗入英国的势力范围，这一如意算盘是美国不感兴趣的。而在国内采取通货再膨胀的措施只能产生极有限的和短暂的效果，而且是饮鸩止渴。
    面对着前景黯淡的新的一年，英国许多资产阶级报刊忧心忡忡。12月20日的“金融时报”在社论中承认，明年的英国经济将笼罩着“大量的乌云”。
