Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - Seoul dispatch: The Syngman Rhee clique, which is desperately trying to force the South Korean "National Assembly" to pass the "National Security Law" amendment, staged another farce of all-out violence in the "National Assembly" today. During the melee, Syngman Rhee's men seriously injured an opposition party member.

Yesterday, while the Democratic Party members of the Legislative and Judicial Subcommittee had not yet arrived, Syngman Rhee's men made a unilateral decision at the subcommittee meeting to submit the "National Security Law" amendment proposed by the Syngman Rhee government on November 18 for "National Assembly" discussion. Democratic Party members have since been staging a sit-down protest inside the "National Assembly" hall since last night to prevent the discussion of this bill, which deprives the South Korean people of their basic human rights. Today, Syngman Rhee's men openly resorted to violence in the "National Assembly," resulting in a melee. Democratic Party member Kim Jae-kun was beaten unconscious and immediately hospitalized, while another Democratic Party member was also injured. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee government also mobilized a large number of plainclothes secret agents to surround the "National Assembly."

    南朝鲜“国会”又演武剧
    李承晚分子大打出手
    反对党议员惨遭毒殴
    新华社平壤20日电  汉城消息：极力设法迫使南朝鲜“国会”通过“国家保安法”修正案的李承晚集团今天又在“国会”中演出一场全武行的丑剧，李承晚分子在这场殴斗中把一名反对党的议员打成重伤。
    李承晚分子昨天趁反对党民主党的委员还没有到的时候，就在“国会”的法制司法分科委员会会议上作出片面决定，要把李承晚政府在11月18日提出的“国家保安法”修正案提交“国会”讨论。民主党的议员于是从昨天晚上起就在“国会”会场内进行静坐斗争，来阻止讨论这项剥夺南朝鲜人民基本人权的法案。今天，李承晚分子公然到“国会”中大打出手，于是引起一场混战，民主党议员金载坤被打得人事不省，立即进了医院，另一个民主党的议员也被打伤。同时，李承晚政府还调集大批便衣特务把“国会”包围起来。
