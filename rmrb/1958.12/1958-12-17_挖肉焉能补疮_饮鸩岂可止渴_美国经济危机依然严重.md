Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, New York Dispatch: Many facts prove that, after more than a year, the United States is still deeply mired in the most serious overproduction crisis since the war. On the other hand, because the US government is trying to stimulate the economy by massively increasing spending, a serious financial crisis has now emerged.

Government Massively Increases Spending
Attempting to Stimulate the Economy

Since the outbreak of the third post-war economic crisis in the United States last fall, the US government, serving the monopoly capital, has hurriedly and repeatedly increased spending to stimulate economic activity. According to figures announced by the US government, in the 1958 fiscal year ending June 30 this year, the federal government's budget expenditure alone reached $71.9 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion over the 1957 fiscal year. However, the actual cash expenditure for this year was as high as $83.3 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion over the previous fiscal year's cash expenditure. After the United States launched an armed invasion of the Middle East in July this year and subsequently engaged in military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, government spending further expanded. In the 1959 fiscal year, which began on July 1 this year, the US government's budget expenditure is $79.2 billion, while the actual cash expenditure is expected to reach $94.1 billion. A large portion of these increased expenditures is military spending. For example, military spending in the 1959 fiscal year is $5 billion more than the peak of military spending during the US war of aggression, equivalent to two and a half times the military spending in 1948. In this year, Congress approved the Department of Defense's authority to sign new contracts up to $15 billion (the Department of Defense can use this authority to place orders, with payments made later), $4 billion more than in 1958. Other significant items include government purchases of "surplus" agricultural products and public works expenditures. At the same time, local government expenditures have also increased accordingly.

Industrial Production Rebounds
Sales Have Not Improved

The US government's frantic increase in spending has enabled some enterprises, especially those related to military production, to obtain large orders, thereby temporarily stimulating their production. Driven by military industrial production, coupled with other factors (such as reduced inventories and a speculative boom in the residential construction industry caused by government interest rate cuts), the US industrial production index rose from 126 in April this year to 138 in October (with the average for 1947-1949 as 100). However, this artificial "rebound" has not caused much "joy" for American monopoly capital, because the fundamental contradiction between overcapacity and the continuous decline in people's consumption is still seriously threatening all sectors of the American economy. According to statistics, as of November, the operating rate of the entire US manufacturing industry was only 75%, meaning that one out of every four machines was idle. The operating rate of the steel industry for the entire year was only about 60%. Automobile production is estimated at only 4.5 million vehicles, almost 50% lower than the output in 1955. At the same time, due to massive unemployment and excessive debt, the purchasing power of ordinary Americans is constantly declining, which is particularly evident in the poor sales of durable consumer goods.

Stimulus Effect Declines
Rebound Has Stalled

What worries the US monopoly bourgeoisie even more is that the stimulating effect of artificial measures on the US economy has declined, some "rebounds" in production have stagnated, and many signs indicate that production may decline again. According to "Business Conditions Digest," US business investment increased from more than $7.7 billion in the second quarter of this year to more than $8.1 billion in the third quarter, but then fell to more than $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Due to the reduced market demand for steel, the steel industry's investment for next year will be 30% less than this year. According to a report in the December 1st issue of "Time" magazine, the number of Americans buying homes through mortgages in October decreased by 14% compared to September. The magazine admitted, "This foreshadows a reduction in home construction in the future." According to official figures, the number of unemployed in November remained at 3.8 million. Many newspapers pointed out that the number of unemployed this winter may exceed 4.5 million.

Agricultural Overproduction is Disastrous
Export Difficulties Increase Daily

The prospects for agriculture are equally bleak. Due to the increase in "surplus" agricultural products this year, the purchase price of agricultural products will be greatly reduced. According to the US Agricultural Marketing Service, the purchase price of wheat will be reduced by 25% compared to last year, reaching the lowest level in thirteen years. And US officials have recently been predicting that farmers' net income next year will decrease by 5% to 10% from $13 billion this year.

In the export market, due to the economic crisis that is prevalent in the capitalist world, the prospects are even bleaker. The recently published US "Foreign Business Weekly" worriedly pointed out that US manufacturers are encountering great difficulties in the capitalist world market. The magazine believes that these difficulties will become increasingly greater in the future.

Economists Predict
Production Will Plunge Again

This increasingly bleak economic outlook has caused great anxiety among many bourgeois economists and newspapers. The famous American economist Hobbs believes that US industrial production will plunge again in 1959.

Severe Fiscal Crisis
Inflation Worsens

The US government's artificial stimulus measures have not only failed to extricate US monopoly capital from the crisis of production "overcapacity," but on the contrary, massively increased spending has caused a serious fiscal crisis and inflation. From July 1 this year to June 30 next year, the US government's budget deficit will be as high as $12.2 billion. If the cash expenditures outside the budget are added, the total will reach more than $13 billion. This amount is more than $2.5 billion more than the highest budget deficit during the US war of aggression in Korea. To make up for the deficit, the government has had to borrow heavily and increase the amount of currency issued. According to the US Treasury Department, the US national debt at the end of October has soared to a historical peak of $280.8 billion. In just one month from September to October, the US government borrowed $4 billion. According to the US Budget Bureau, the national debt may reach $288 billion by the end of June next year. On the other hand, although production has greatly declined, the supply of currency has increased by more than $13 billion. The supply of dollars is now four times more than before the war, while production has only increased by less than one time. As a result of inflation, the actual value of the dollar is declining day by day. From June last year to the present, domestic prices in the United States have risen by 4.7%.

Ruling Group Decides
To Fleece the People Again

Faced with this critical situation, the US ruling group has decided to launch a new offensive against the ordinary American people, asking them to bear the burden of the crisis. The December 5th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" pointed out that 1959 will be the year of the largest tax increase in the United States. The magazine said that in the next two years, each taxpayer will pay 50% more in income tax than now. According to US officials, the US government has also decided to drastically cut social needs spending and some other non-military appropriations in the next fiscal year's budget.

    挖肉焉能补疮  饮鸩岂可止渴
    美国经济危机依然严重
    新华社15日讯  纽约消息：许多事实证明，经过一年多时间以后，美国目前仍然深深地陷在战后最严重的生产过剩危机中，而在另一方面，由于美国政府妄图用大量增加开支的办法刺激经济，现在又出现了严重的财政危机。
    政府大增开支
    企图刺激经济
    从去年秋季美国战后第三次经济危机开始以后，为垄断资本服务的美国政府就慌忙一再增加开支来刺激经济活动。据美国政府宣布的数字，在今年6月30日结束的1958财政年度，单单是联邦政府的预算开支就达七百一十九亿美元，这个数目比1957财政年度增加了二十五亿美元，但这一年度的实际现金开支高达八百三十三亿美元，比上一财政年度现金开支增加了三十三亿美元。今年7月美国在中东发动武装侵略以及随后在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅之后，政府的开支又进一步膨胀。在今年7月1日开始的1959财政年度里，美国政府的预算开支为七百九十二亿美元，而实际现金开支预计将达九百四十一亿美元。这些增加的开支中，很大一部分是军事费用，例如，1959财政年度中的军事开支比美国侵略战争中军事开支的最高峰还多五十亿美元，等于1948年军事开支的两倍半。在这一年度里，国会批准给国防部签订新合同的权限达到一百五十亿美元（国防部可以利用这种权限去订货，到以后付款），比1958年多四十亿美元。其余的显著项目包括政府对“过剩”农产品的收购，公共工程的支出等。同时，地方政府的开支也相应增加。
    工业生产回升
    销路并未好转
    美国政府这样疯狂地增加开支，使一些企业、特别是同军事生产有关的企业获得大批订货，从而暂时刺激了它们的生产。在军事工业生产的带动下，再加上其他的一些因素（如存货的减少以及由于政府降低利率而一度造成住宅建筑业的投机风潮等），美国工业生产指数从今年4月份的一百二十六回升到10月份的一百三十八（以1947—1949年的平均数为一百）。但是这种人为的“回升”并没有引起美国垄断资本多大的“欢跃”，因为生产能力过剩和人民消费不断降低的这一根本矛盾仍然在严重地威胁着美国经济的各个部门。据统计，到11月份为止，美国整个制造业的开工率还只有75％，就是说每四部机器中就有一部被闲置不用。钢铁工业全年的开工率仅达到60％左右。汽车的生产估计只有四百五十万辆，比1955年的产量几乎要低50％。同时，由于大量的失业和债务过多，美国普通人民的购买力在不断地下降，这一点特别暴露在耐用消费品的销路不佳上。
    刺激作用衰退
    回升已告停滞
    使美国垄断资产阶级感到更大忧虑的是，人为措施对美国经济所起的刺激作用已经衰退，生产中的某些“回升”已经呈现停滞，而且许多迹象表明，生产可能再度下降。据“商业现况调查”杂志说，美国企业投资曾经从今年第二季度的七十七亿多美元增加到第三季度的八十一亿多美元，但是到第四季度又下跌到七十七亿多美元。因为市场上对钢铁需要的减少，钢铁工业用于明年的投资将比今年减少30％。据12月1日的“时代”周刊报道，美国人通过抵押方式来购买房屋的数目在10月份比9月份减少了14％，这家杂志承认，“这预示着房屋建筑以后将减少。”失业人数根据官方数字，11月份仍然有三百八十万。许多报刊指出，今年冬天失业人数有可能超过四百五十万。
    农产过剩成灾
    出口困难日增
    农业方面的前景也同样不妙。由于今年“过剩”农产品的增加，农产品的收购价格将会大大降低，据美国农业市场服务处说，小麦的收购价格将比去年降低25％，达到十三年来的最低水平。而美国官员最近已经在预言，明年农民的净收入将从今年的一百三十亿美元减少5％到10％。
    在出口市场方面，由于在资本主义世界普遍出现的经济危机，前景更是一片黯淡。最近出版的美国“国外商业周刊”忧虑地指出，美国制造商在资本主义世界市场上遇到很大的困难。这家刊物认为，这种困难今后将会越来越大。
    经济学家预言
    生产将再暴跌
    经济方面这种愈来愈阴暗的前景，使得许多资产阶级经济学家和报刊感到极大不安。美国著名的经济学家霍布斯认为，1959年美国的工业生产将会再度暴跌。
    财政危机严重
    通货膨胀恶化
    美国政府这种人为的刺激措施不仅没有使美国垄断资本摆脱生产“过剩”的危机，相反的，大量增加开支已经引起严重的财政危机和通货膨胀。从今年7月1日到明年6月30日的财政年度，美国政府预算赤字将高达一百二十二亿美元，如果加上预算以外的现金花费，总数将达到一百三十亿美元以上。这个数目比美国侵朝战争时期最高的预算赤字还要多二十五亿美元以上，为了弥补赤字，政府已不得不大量举债和增加货币发行量。据美国财政部宣布，美国国债在10月底已激增到二千八百零八亿美元的历史最高峰。仅从9月到10月的一个月里，美国政府借的债就达四十亿美元。据美国预算局估计，到明年6月底，国债可能达到二千八百八十亿美元。另一方面虽然生产大大下降，而货币的供应却增加了一百三十多亿美元。现在美元的供应量比战前增加了四倍，而生产却只增长了不到一倍。通货膨胀的结果，使得美元的实际价值日益下降。从去年6月到现在，美国国内物价上涨了4.7％。
    统治集团决定
    再向人民开刀
    面对着这种危急的局面，美国统治集团已决定向美国普通人民展开新的进攻，要他们来承受危机的重担。12月5日的“美国新闻与世界报道”指出，1959年将是美国增税最大的一年。这家刊物说，在未来的两年中，每个纳税人所交纳的所得税比现在要多50％。据美国官方人士还透露，美国政府已经决定大量削减下一财政年度预算中的社会需要的开支和其他某些非军事拨款。
