    This Road Won't Work

    After suffering heavy blows, the imperialists can always learn a bit. Dulles had to change his tune and acknowledge China's existence, which is one example. However, compared to the stubborn Dulles, there were some who learned to be smarter even earlier.

    George Allen, the director of the United States Information Agency, discovered the predicament of American foreign propaganda some time ago. In 1957, despite spending nearly one hundred million dollars, the effect was not wonderful. Therefore, he announced that the methods would be changed in 1959. One of the changes was: "Emphasize the promotion of American culture and reduce the promotion of American economic and military power."

    This reveals two messages: First, even the American news official himself admits that the propaganda of war-mongering and financial seduction has failed; therefore, second, more yellow cultural bacteria will be released from the United States than in the past.

    This second point deserves vigilance from the people of the world. However, given that the market for American yellow books, yellow music, and rock and roll is getting smaller and smaller and is being increasingly resisted, we can also give this news official a heads-up, saying: This road won't work!

    帝国主义者在碰得头破血流之后，多少总能学些乖。杜勒斯不得不改口承认中国之存在，就是一例。不过，比起冥顽不灵的杜勒斯来，也还有比他学乖学得早些的。
    美国新闻署署长乔治·艾伦在早些时候就发现美国对外宣传上的窘境，以1957年来说，尽管花了将近一亿美元，效果却并不美妙。于是他宣布1959年要改变方法。其中有一条是：“强调宣传美国的文化，少宣传一些美国的经济和军事力量。”
    这就透露了两个消息：一、连美国新闻官自己也承认战争叫嚣和金元勾引的宣传失败；因此，二、从美国放出来的黄色文化细菌将要比过去更多。
    这后一条是值得世界人民引起警惕的。然而，鉴于美国的黄色书刊、黄色音乐、摇摆舞的市场越来越少，越来越被抵制，我们也可以向这位新闻官预告一声，曰：此路不通！
