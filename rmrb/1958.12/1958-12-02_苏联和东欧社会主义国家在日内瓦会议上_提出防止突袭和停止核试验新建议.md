Xinhua News Agency Report: To advance the Conference on Preventing Surprise Attacks, the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries presented several practical measures on November 28.

According to a communique issued after the meeting, Soviet representative Kuznetsov presented to the conference "The Soviet Government's Statement on Measures to Prevent Surprise Attacks."

It is understood that the statement contains specific measures to prevent one country from launching a surprise attack on other countries. It suggests establishing monitoring stations at important railway stations, seaports, and highways to monitor troop concentrations and other methods of surprise attack. Monitoring stations would be established in Warsaw Pact countries, NATO countries, and Iran, a member of the Baghdad Pact with close ties to NATO. According to the proposal, an equal number of monitoring stations should be established in the Soviet Union and the United States.

The statement also includes measures for aerial inspection. The proposed aerial photography would be carried out in equal areas of the Soviet Union and the United States.

Reportedly, the statement suggests reducing foreign troops stationed in Europe and recommends that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany refuse to deploy nuclear weapons on their territories.

According to conference participants, the Soviet delegation made it clear that these measures are insufficient to prevent surprise attacks and must be linked to other disarmament measures.

On the same day, Czechoslovakian representative Dr. Hajek, on behalf of the delegations of Albania, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, presented to the conference "Proposals on Establishing Ground Monitoring Stations, Conducting Aerial Inspections, and Simultaneously Implementing Certain Measures in Disarmament to Reduce the Danger of Surprise Attacks."

The statements and proposals of the socialist countries powerfully refuted the slander by the West that the East is keen on "political propaganda" and does not pay attention to the "technical aspects" of preventing surprise attacks, especially the monitoring system.

The Western representatives came to Geneva not to reach an agreement on preventing surprise attacks, thereby helping to ease international tensions. They are considering easing world opinion in the struggle for peace and security, gathering intelligence on modern weapons, and freely entering the territory of socialist countries. Therefore, in contrast to the attitude of the socialist countries attending the conference, they have not put forward any practical suggestions to prevent the danger of surprise attacks, but only put forward some lists of weapons and ways to identify them.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 29th: In order to break the deadlock in the conference, the Soviet delegation presented the Soviet government's declaration on the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests and a draft amendment to the agreement on stopping nuclear weapon tests at the meeting on not continuing to test nuclear weapons on the 29th.

It is understood that the draft amendment to the agreement proposed by the Soviet government stipulates that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, participating in the current meeting, undertake the obligation to stop testing all types of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. The draft amendment to the agreement also stipulates that the three governments agree to urge other countries' governments to also participate in the agreement to stop nuclear tests, and to implement a monitoring system in accordance with the recommendations agreed upon at the first Geneva Experts Conference, establishing monitoring stations on their own territories and their overseas territories.

The draft amendment to the agreement proposed by the Soviet Union also suggests that the monitoring system be implemented simultaneously with the agreement to stop nuclear tests. This removes any further excuses for the West to obstruct an agreement on the issue of banning nuclear weapon tests.

According to the communique issued by the conference, the US delegation presented at the meeting the first clause of its proposed treaty on the issue of stopping nuclear tests—the clause on the obligation not to continue nuclear weapon tests and to cooperate with the nuclear weapon test monitoring agency.

### 苏联和东欧社会主义国家在日内瓦会议上  提出防止突袭和停止核试验新建议

    苏联和东欧社会主义国家在日内瓦会议上
    提出防止突袭和停止核试验新建议
    据新华社讯  苏联和东欧社会主义国家为了使防止突然袭击的会议取得进展，在11月28日提出了若干实际措施。
    据会后发表的公报说，苏联代表库兹涅佐夫向会议提出了“苏联政府关于防止突袭的措施的声明”。
    据悉，声明中包含有防止一国对其他国家进行突袭的具体措施。它建议在重要的火车站、海港和公路上设立监督站以监督军队的集结和其他突袭方法。监督站将设立在华沙条约国家、北大西洋集团国家以及同北大西洋集团有密切联系的巴格达条约成员国伊朗。根据建议，在苏联和美国应当建立数量相等的监督站。
    声明中还包括空中视察措施。建议中的空中摄影将在苏联和美国的相等的地区中实行。
    据报道，声明建议减少驻在欧洲地区的外国军队，并建议德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国拒绝在它们的领土上设置核武器。
    据会议人士说，苏联代表团清楚表明，这一切措施是不足以防止突袭的，它们必须同其他裁军措施联系起来。
    同一天，捷克斯洛伐克代表哈耶克博士代表阿尔巴尼亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团向会议提出了“关于建立地上监督站、进行空中视察以及在裁军方面同时实行某些措施以减少突袭危险的建议”。
    社会主义国家的声明和建议有力地驳斥了西方的这样一种谰言：东方热中于“政治宣传”，而不注意防止突袭问题的“技术方面”，特别是监督制度。
    西方代表来到日内瓦并不是想就防止突袭问题达成协议，从而帮助缓和国际紧张局势。他们考虑的是缓和世界争取和平和安全的舆论、搜集关于现代武器的情报和自由地进入社会主义国家的境内。因此，同出席会议的社会主义国家的态度相反，他们还没有提出任何防止突袭危险的实际建议，只是提出了一些武器清单以及辨别它们的办法。
    新华社日内瓦29日电  为了打破会议僵局，苏联代表团29日在不继续试验核武器会议上提出了苏联政府关于停止核武器试验问题的宣言和关于停止核武器试验的协定修正草案。
    据悉，苏联政府提出的协定修正草案规定，参加目前会议的苏美英三国政府承担停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的义务。协定修正草案还规定：三国政府同意促使其他国家政府也参加停止核试验的协定，并且根据第一次日内瓦专家会议上商定的建议实施监督制度，在它们自己的领土上和它们的海外领地上建立监督站。
    苏联提出的协定修正草案还建议，监督制度将同停止核试验的协定同时实施。这一点就使西方不再有借口来阻挠就禁止核武器试验问题达成协议。
    据会议发表的公报说，美国代表团在会议上提出了它所拟议的关于停止核试验问题的条约的第一项条款——关于不继续核武器试验和同核武器试验监督机构合作的义务的条款。
