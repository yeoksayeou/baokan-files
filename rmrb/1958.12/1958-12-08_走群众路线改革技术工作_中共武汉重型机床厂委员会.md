    Craft regulations were originally intended to guide production. However, before the "Double-Anti" movement, many of our plant's crafts became a constraint on production. A cold processing craft would be at least four or five pages long, and up to over a hundred pages. Workers had to read them, but it was a mental drain and a waste of time. Workers said it was a "craft novel," "as thick as a novel, but not as engaging."

    In other aspects of technical work, the situation of being detached from reality and the masses was also serious. For example, the equipment operation procedures were all compiled by the Mechanical and Power Section. Once compiled, they were implemented, and if workers did not follow the operating procedures and accidents occurred, they were punished. As a result, equipment accidents continued to increase. The process of compiling these equipment operation procedures was a joke. A student who had just graduated from a technical secondary school had never even seen many of the devices, yet he compiled procedures for workers based on materials, manuals, and books. Workers said: "It's like teaching a mother how to raise a child."

    The reasons for the above situation were, on the one hand, that the engineering and technical personnel's thinking was not liberated, and the style of dogmatism, mechanically copying, detachment from reality, and self-righteousness was relatively strong. But more importantly, the factory leadership's subjectivism and dogmatism. As a result, some unrealistic rules and regulations were brought in, which restricted the development of production, restricted the workers, restricted the engineering and technical personnel, and also restricted the leadership.

    Treating the Symptoms Without Addressing the Root Cause

    During the period of great airing and contending last year, some problems existing in the craft were exposed. The Craft Section also thought about simplifying the craft, but only wanted to simplify it within the scope of "doing things according to the rules."

    After the start of the "Double-Anti" movement, there was not a single workshop that did not have opinions about the craft department. The Craft Section itself also felt that there was a problem; it should be changed, but how to change it? They could not find the direction. Their thinking was still tied by four ropes. The first rope was the so-called legal concept. They believed that the format and content of craft documents were issued by the ministry, and implementing craft and abiding by craft discipline were old principles. The second rope was that the old factories all did this, and it had been effective, so it could not be easily changed. The third rope was fear of responsibility. What if the craft was not written in full, and defective products were produced, who would be responsible? What if random changes caused chaos? The fourth rope was that they could not put down their airs. They believed that they were technicians and engineers, had gone to university, and knew more than the workers, and were unwilling to consult the workers. In short, they believed in themselves, believed in the system, and did not believe in the workers. They said: "Craft discipline is the factory's regulation, and random changes will cause chaos."

    The leadership also realized the seriousness of this problem, but did not find a way to solve it. In February of this year, when discussing the completion of production tasks in the model workshop, the workshop construction team and workers proposed to modify the model structure. After debate, the Forging and Metallurgical Section agreed and handed it over to the workshop for modification. Later, the Forging and Metallurgical Section also held two forums with veteran workers in the model workshop and decided to simplify the craft documents, and put forward several proposals on the standardization of core boxes and pouring systems, and some other issues. At that time, the leadership felt that this approach was right, but did not raise it to the level of taking the mass line in technical work, and did not summarize and promote it well. As a result, some piecemeal, ameliorative, symptomatic measures taken in the rectification did not solve the fundamental problem, and the masses were not satisfied.

    Combining the Real and the Virtual to Liberate Thinking

    In the later period of the "Double-Anti" airing and contending, we analyzed the big-character posters, held forums with veteran workers and forums with cadres, and found that in addition to concentrating on the leadership's ideology and work style, the masses' opinions were also more prominent on technical management issues in production management. Therefore, after the Party committee solved the problem of the leadership's ideology and work style, it proposed that "technical work should take the lead and be at the forefront of the movement," and the deputy director in charge of production was responsible for the technical departments, and the Party secretary and the provincial Party committee work group conducted pilot projects in the No. 1 machining small parts workshop.

    At that time, although the personnel of the Craft Section were tightly bound by four ropes, the vigorous "Double-Anti" movement promoted changes in their thinking. With the help of advanced craft personnel, the comrades of the Craft Section held forums with the No. 1 machining assembly workshop, the large parts workshop, and the small parts workshop, and face-to-face debates, which gave them a great education.

    Through face-to-face ideological struggle with the workers, through the education of facts, and through debates in the section's large and small meetings, it was clarified "What is the use of craft?" "Who is it for?" The ropes were loosened a little. However, at this time, the understanding was still limited to the level of "simplifying the craft," and the ropes were not completely untied.

    The Party committee studied these situations, summarized and improved them, grasped the fundamental problems of technical management, found the direction, and loudly put forward the slogan "Technical work takes the mass line." Through the combination of top and bottom, mutual promotion, and the joint efforts of leaders, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, the long-awaited battle achieved victory on the decisive battlefield of the Craft Section, thereby establishing a banner for the mass line of the entire technical work and promoting the full bloom.

    At this time, the factory leaders further proposed several principles for reforming the craft: (1) Simple crafts should not be compiled, or should be compiled by workers; (2) Crafts should be typicalized; (3) Complex crafts should be studied with workers, preferably by consulting workers first and then compiling; (4) Craft content should be simplified; (5) Simple tools and fixtures should be self-designed, self-made, and self-used by workers; (6) Complex tools and fixtures should be designed in consultation with workers, preferably by consulting workers first and then designing. At the same time, four more points were put forward: First, as long as it is convenient for production and convenient for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, it is right; Second, the standard for measuring right and wrong is more, faster, better, and more economical; Third, the method is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, come from the masses, and go to the masses; Fourth, the attitude should be firm, implement it if you understand it, debate it if you don't agree, and experiment if you are not sure. In this way, the ideological fortress was finally broken, and they quickly took action. From then on, they were determined to face production and face reality, and proposed comprehensive measures to take the mass line.

    Due to the craft taking the mass line, the craft work of cold processing and hot processing has undergone great changes, and the atmosphere is completely new, and great achievements have been made. Taking cold processing craft as an example:

    1.  The craft has been greatly simplified, and the efficiency has been greatly improved. The average time for compiling the craft has been reduced by 60%, the time for workers to read the craft has been reduced by 75%, and the paper has been reduced by 75%. Paper alone saves 600 yuan a month. Originally, the Craft Section compiled 13 kinds of product crafts for 1959, and could only compile 12 kinds. After simplification, it proposed to compile 27 kinds of product crafts. The number of craft personnel has also been reduced.

    2.  The quality has been improved. The compilation of the craft is more practical, and many difficulties have been overcome.

    3.  The design of tools and fixtures ensures the quality. Now they generally consult the opinions of veteran masters before designing after receiving the design task book. For example, the headstock hanger of the large lathe designed by Comrade Li Qiyuan, the original plan was more complicated. After he studied with the workers, he improved the structure of the tools and fixtures. The new fixture saved more than five times more than the original plan. For example, there are two rack gauges, which were designed before the Double-Anti movement. After everyone's awareness was improved in the Double-Anti movement, the comrades who engaged in measuring tools discussed with the masses to improve them. The previous ones were only used for one product, but now they can be used for four products. The previous ones had 30 parts, but now they have been changed to 24 parts. The previous ones had 22 parts, but now they have been changed to 2 parts. The manufacturing cost has been saved by more than 1,100 yuan.

    The masses are very satisfied with the simplification of the craft, and the engineering and technical personnel are also very happy. The gear workshop has a allegro, which reflects the situation before and after the reform:

    Four people in the craft compile, each copy averages six sheets, each sheet is not ordinary, each book of theory is turned down, regardless of the actual side, workers glare at it. Go to the office to find the construction worker, quickly read the article, the article has been read for half a day, the workers only touch the edge, several sets of tools are made, single pieces and small batches are not needed, how can this craft work, the eight-part essay kills people.

    It is more beneficial to decentralize the craft, reducing several baskets of articles, discussing and simplifying everyone's work, Zhuge is not as good as three cobblers, workers do not have to bite the article, the simple size is very good, the tool coefficient is greatly reduced, everyone nods and says good.

    Several Experiences

    Technical work taking the mass line is the embodiment of the mass line in the Party's work in technical work. In the past, we only believed in a few engineering and technical personnel, did not believe in the workers, and were bound by old rules and regulations. In the great rectification movement, everyone's thinking was liberated, and after arduous and complex struggles, we finally found this direction. Our experience is:

    First, we must put politics in command and liberate our minds. Only with a solid ideological foundation can we break superstitions and realize the mass line in technical work. The entire struggle process of our plant's technical work taking the mass line vividly and powerfully proves this problem. In the past, because we did not grasp putting politics in command, ideological work was weak, and the leadership lacked the idea of relying on the workers, did not treat them as the real masters of the enterprise, and did not regard the workers as the source of knowledge and strength. As a result, technical work was trapped in the circle of a few engineering and technical personnel, making technical work detached from reality and the masses, making technical work lag behind the needs of production development, and even become an obstacle to production in some places. On the other hand, it is precisely because politics has been put in command, thinking has been liberated, superstitions have been broken, resolved, and we have resolutely relied on the workers and implemented the mass line that technical work has shown a new situation.

    Second, the combination of leadership and the masses is the basic method for realizing the mass line in technical work. Specifically, it is the combination of two three, one is the combination of leaders, workers, and engineering personnel. In the rectification movement, the factory Party and government leaders changed their style, were determined to integrate with the masses, listened to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, gathered them together, studied and analyzed them, and educated themselves, educated the workers, and promoted the engineering and technical personnel. The workers have the deepest feelings and the sharpest struggles against various unreasonable systems and erroneous ideological styles. Their criticism promoted the leadership and also promoted the engineering and technical personnel. The development of things is always the external cause acting through the internal cause. The ideological situation of the engineering and technical personnel has changed in the great rectification movement. After the education of facts, and through the promotion of the leadership and the workers, the advanced led the backward, and ideological struggles were launched. Finally, the ideological liberation was comprehensive, and they quickly took action. The factors of leaders, workers, and engineering and technical personnel cannot be ignored, and when the three aspects are combined, they become a huge force.

    One is the combination of airing, contending, debate and rectification. At the beginning, it was airing and contending. There will inevitably be different understandings in airing and contending, so there must be debates, and changes must be made when the debates are clarified. But the initial changes are always incomplete. We must air, contend, and debate again, and implement it when the debates are clarified, and experiment if we are not sure. This is how we deepen step by step, more and more thoroughly. It can be said that every stage and every step of our development is realized through the combination of airing, contending, and rectification.

    Third, technical work taking the mass line is the road of being both red and expert for our plant's technical personnel. Engineering and technical personnel get rid of the shackles of dogmatism, combine with reality, combine with the workers, participate in production labor, and learn from the workers. If they can do this, they can achieve "red" in ideology, style, and action, and achieve "expert" in technology and business. The fact that our plant's technical work has achieved great gains in production, economy, ideology, and politics in a short period of time, as mentioned above, is a very good proof.

    走群众路线改革技术工作
    中共武汉重型机床厂委员会
    工艺规程本来是用来指导生产的。但是双反运动以前，我厂的不少工艺却成了束缚生产的东西。一份冷加工工艺，少者四、五页，多者一百多页。加工一个丝杆螺母，就编了二十三页。工人不看不行，看起来伤透脑筋，浪费时间。工人说这是“工艺小说”，“有小说那么厚，没有小说那么吸引人”。
    技术工作的其他方面，脱离实际，脱离群众的情况也是严重的。例如设备的操作规程，都是机械动力科编的，编了就贯彻，如果工人不按操作规程办事，出了事故就处分。结果设备事故仍然有增无减。这些设备操作规程的编制过程说起来是个笑话，一位刚从中等技术学校毕业的学生，许多设备连看都没有看过，他却凭资料、说明书和书本，编出规程来给工人讲课。工人说：“简直是教妈妈养孩子”。
    造成上述情况的原因，一方面是工程技术人员思想未解放，教条主义，生搬硬套，脱离实际，自以为是的风气比较重；但更重要的是工厂领导上存在着主观主义、教条主义。结果搬来了一些不切实际的规章制度，束缚了生产的发展，束缚了工人，束缚了工程技术人员，也束缚了领导。
    治标未治本
    去年大鸣大放的时候，曾揭发过一些工艺上存在的问题。工艺科也想过简化工艺，但是只是想在“照章办事”的范围内来简化。
    双反运动开始以后，没有一个车间对工艺部门没有意见，工艺科自己也感到有问题；应该改，如何改呢？却找不到方向。他们的思想，还被四根绳子捆着。第一根是所谓法律观念。认为工艺文件格式和内容是部里颁发的，贯彻工艺，遵守工艺纪律是老原则；第二根是老厂都这样做，已行之有效，不能轻易改动；第三根是怕负责任。假如不把工艺写齐全，出了废品谁负责？随便改了造成混乱怎么办？第四根是架子放不下。认为自己是技术员，工程师，读过大学，比工人懂得多，不愿请教工人。总之是相信自己，相信制度，不相信工人群众。说：“工艺纪律是厂里的法规，随便改动会乱了套”。
    领导思想上也曾意识到这个问题的严重，但未摸到解决问题的途径。今年2月，在模型车间讨论完成生产任务的时候，车间施工组和工人提出要修改模型结构。经过辩论，锻冶科同意，交由车间修改。以后锻冶科又和模型车间老工人开过两次座谈会，决定简化工艺文件，对芯盒和浇注系统的标准化，以及其他一些问题提过几种方案。当时领导上感到这样做法对，但是没有提高到技术工作走群众路线上来认识，没有很好总结推广。结果，在整改中所采取一些就事论事的、改良的、治标的措施，并没有解决根本问题，群众也不满意。
    实虚并举解放思想
    双反鸣放后期，我们分析了大字报，召开了老工人座谈会、干部座谈会，发现群众的意见除了集中在领导思想作风以外，对生产管理中的技术管理问题也比较突出，于是党委在解决了领导思想作风问题以后，提出“技术工作要一马当先、走在运动最前面”，并且由生产副厂长负责技术科室，党委书记和省委工作组在一加工中小件车间搞试点。
    当时工艺科的人员虽然有四根绳子捆得很紧，终因轰轰烈烈的双反运动促进了他们思想的变化。在先进工艺人员的帮助下，工艺科的同志到一加工装配车间、重大件车间、中小件车间和老工人开座谈会，面对面的辩论，给他们教育很大。
    经过工人面对面的思想斗争，经过事实的教育，经过科里大小会的辩论，明确了“工艺做什么用？”“到底给谁看？”绳子松开了一些。不过这时认识还限于“要简化工艺”的水平上，绳子还没有完全解开。
    党委对这些情况作了研究，总结提高，抓住了技术管理的根本问题，找到了方向，响亮地提出“技术工作走群众路线”的口号。经过上下结合，互相促进，领导、工人、工程技术人员三方面并肩携手，酝酿已久的战斗，在工艺科这个决定性的战场上取得了胜利，从而为整个技术工作的群众路线树立了旗帜，促成了全面开花。
    这时，工厂领导同志又进一步提出了改革工艺几项原则：（1）简单的工艺不编，或由工人编；（2）工艺典型化；（3）复杂的工艺与工人研究，最好是先请教工人，以后再编；（4）工艺内容要简化；（5）简单的工卡具由工人自设、自制、自用；（6）复杂的工卡具与工人研究设计，最好是先请教工人后再设计。同时，又提出了四条：第一、只要是便利于生产，便利于工农业大跃进就是对的；第二、衡量对与不对的标准是多快好省；第三、方法是相信群众，依靠群众，从群众中来，到群众中去；第四、态度要坚决，通了就贯彻，不统一就辩，没有把握的就试验。这样最后攻破了思想堡垒，就迅速行动起来。他们从此下定决心，面向生产，面向实际，提出全面的走群众路线的措施。
    由于工艺走群众路线，冷加工、热加工的工艺工作大有转变，气象焕然一新，成绩很大，以冷加工工艺为例：
    一、工艺大大简化，效率大大提高了。平均减少编制工艺时间60％，减少工人阅读工艺时间75％，纸张减少75％。光是纸张一个月就节约六百元。原来工艺科为1959年编了十三种产品工艺，只能编出十二种，简化以后提出编二十七种产品工艺。工艺人员也减少了。
    二、质量提高了。编制工艺比较切合实际，还克服了许多困难。
    三、工卡具设计保证了质量。现在他们一般都是接到设计任务书后，先征求老师傅的意见，再设计。如李棨元同志设计的大车床，床头箱吊架，原来想的方案比较复杂，经过他与工人研究后，改良了工卡具的结构，新的卡具比原方案节约了五倍以上。又如：有两个齿条检具，是双反前设计的，在双反后大家觉悟提高了，由搞量具的同志找群众商量改进后，以前的只用于一种产品，现在可通用于四种产品，以前是三十个零件的现改为二十四个零件，以前是二十二个零件的现改为两个零件。制造费节约一千一百多元。
    群众对简化工艺很满意，工程技术人员也兴高彩烈。齿轮车间有首快板，反映了改革前后的情况：
    工艺四人编，一份平均足六片，片片上面不一般，本本的理论向下翻，不管实际放一边，工人一看瞪了眼。科室去找施工员，快把文章读一遍，文章读了有半天，工人才算摸到边，工具作了几大套，单件小批不需要，这样工艺怎能行，八股文章害死人。
    工艺下放好处多，少了文章几大箩、讨论简化大家干，诸葛不如三皮匠，工人不用咬文章，简图尺寸很好看，工具系数大减少，大家点头都说好。
    几点体会
    技术工作走群众路线，就是党的工作中的群众路线在技术工作上的体现。过去我们只相信少数工程技术人员，不相信工人群众，给陈规旧律束缚着。在伟大的整风运动中，大家的思想解放了，经过艰巨复杂的斗争，终于找到了这个方向。我们的体会是：
    第一、必须政治挂帅、解放思想，有了牢固的思想基础，才能破除迷信，实现技术工作走群众路线。我厂技术工作走群众路线的全部斗争过程，生动而有力地证明了这个问题，以往由于未抓住政治挂帅，思想工作薄弱，领导上缺乏依靠工人群众的思想，没有把他们当成企业真正的主人，没有把工人群众看成是知识和力量的源泉，因而使得技术工作陷于少数工程技术人员圈子里，使得技术工作脱离实际、脱离群众，使得技术工作落后于生产发展的需要，甚至某些地方成为生产的障碍，另一方面也正是由于政治挂帅了，思想解放了，迷信破除了，解决了，坚决依靠工人群众，贯彻了群众路线，使技术工作出现了一个崭新的局面。
    第二、领导与群众相结合，这是实现技术工作走群众路线的基本方法。具体来说也就是两个三结合，一是领导、工人、工程人员相结合，在整风运动中，厂党政领导转变作风，下定决心和群众打成一片，虚心听取群众意见，集中起来，研究分析，教育自己，教育工人群众，促进工程技术人员。工人群众对各种不合理的制度、错误的思想作风，是感受最深、斗争最尖锐的，他们的批评推动了领导，也推动了工程技术人员。事物的发展，总是外因通过内因起作用的，工程技术人员在伟大的整风运动中，思想状况发生了变化，经过事实的教育，经过领导和工人群众的促进，先进的带动后进，展开思想斗争，最后思想全面解放，迅速行动起来。领导、工人、工程技术人员三方面的因素都是不能忽视的，当三方面结合起来了，就成了巨大的力量。
    一是鸣放辩论整改相结合。开始是鸣放，鸣放中必然有不同的认识，就要辩，辩通了就改。但是开始改总是不彻底的，再鸣放、再辩，通了就贯彻，没有把握就试验，这样一步一步的深入，越来越彻底。可以说，我们每一个阶段，每一步发展都是以鸣、辩、改相结合来实现的。
    第三、技术工作走群众路线，就是我厂技术人员红与专的道路。工程技术人员摆脱教条主义的束缚，与实际结合，与工人群众结合，参加生产劳动，向工人群众学习，如果做到这样，就能在思想上、作风上、行动上达到“红”，技术上、业务上达到“专”。我厂技术工作走群众路线短短一段时间里，如同前面说到的生产上、经济上、思想上、政治上都获得极大的收获，就是一个很好的证明。
