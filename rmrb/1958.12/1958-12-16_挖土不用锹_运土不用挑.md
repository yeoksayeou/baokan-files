According to the Hubei Daily: Li Hongwu, the captain of the vegetable production team of a commune in the suburbs of Honghu, Hubei, and carpenter Lu Defu, have carefully trial-produced a "animal-powered soil shovel." This animal-powered soil shovel is simple to manufacture. Just use a few mulberry trees to make a rectangular frame, install an inclined wooden board on the frame for scooping and stopping soil, and add four handrail posts to control loading and unloading operations. During operation, first loosen the soil, then press the handrail posts and the soil will follow the cattle; when unloading the soil, just lift the posts. Its efficiency is that one person and one cow can transport 71 cubic meters of soil per day, and the cost is about 10 yuan.
If two small pulleys are added on both sides under the frame, and the soil shoveling board is covered with iron sheet to make it rotate forward more sharply, the efficiency of one person per day can be increased from the original 71 cubic meters to more than 120 cubic meters. Now it has been widely promoted throughout the county, and in many places, digging soil without a shovel and transporting soil without carrying has been realized.

    挖土不用锹  运土不用挑
    据湖北日报消息  湖北洪湖郊区公社蔬菜生产大队大队长黎洪武和木工卢德富等精心试制成功一部“畜力铲土器”。这种畜力铲土器，制造简单，只要用几根桑树做一个长方形的架子，架上安一块斜形木板，以便撮土拦土，加上四根扶手柱子以掌握装卸操作。操作时，先将土耕松，再把扶手柱子一按，土就跟着牛走；卸土时，只将柱子一提就行了。它的工效是每天一人一牛可运土七十一方，造价约十元。
    如果在架子底下两旁加装两个小滑轮，在铲土板子上包上铁皮，使其向前旋转更加锋锐，这样一人一天工效，可以由原七十一方提高到一百二十多方。现在全县已普遍推广，许多地方实现了挖土不用锹，运土不用挑。
