Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th. Our correspondent reports that North Korea's coal production this year, calculated per capita, has greatly exceeded that of Japan. According to Pyongyang newspapers today, the workers of various coal mines in North Korea had produced 6.1 million tons of coal by December 11th of this year, completing the state plan ahead of schedule. They are now confidently striving to reach a coal production of 6.9 million tons by the end of the year. In this way, North Korea will have an average of 690 kilograms of coal per person this year, while Japan currently has only 568 kilograms per person.

Currently, coal mines in North Korea are widely adopting advanced technologies and are actively preparing to produce 12 million tons of coal next year, completing the target set by the Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule.

The coal mines in North Korea were severely damaged during the war. All the wellhead equipment was destroyed, and many tunnels were flooded and collapsed. In the five years since the war, Korean workers have restored and expanded all the original mines, and have also built new mines.

With the assistance of fraternal countries, Korea has equipped each coal mine with modern machinery - electric drills, chain and belt conveyors, electric vehicles, etc. In all bituminous coal mines, the mechanization of coal transportation has reached more than 76%. This year, the coal output of each bituminous coal miner increased by 3.4 tons compared to 1949, and the coal output of workers in anthracite mines increased by 6.9 tons.

Due to the widespread promotion of labor hero Kim Chik-hyon's high-speed tunneling method, the tunneling speed of each three-person tunneling team in North Korean coal mines has increased from 30 to 40 meters per month to about 100 meters. Therefore, North Korea's coal production this year has increased by about 70% compared to 1949 before the war.

At present, various coal mines are actively preparing to fully promote hydraulic coal mining methods, while continuing to increase tunneling speed. The recent daily output of famous coal mines such as Aoji and Gaogianyuan has doubled compared to the beginning of this year. (Photo attached)

    朝鲜煤炭工业大步前进
    按人口计算产量已超过日本
    新华社平壤14日电  本社记者报道，朝鲜北部今年的煤产量按人口平均计算已经大大超过了日本。据平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜北部各煤矿的职工们，到今年12月11日为止，已经生产了六百一十万吨煤，提前完成了国家计划。他们正在满怀信心地争取在年内使煤产量达到六百九十万吨。这样，朝鲜北部今年平均每人将可分得煤六百九十公斤，而日本目前平均每人只有五百六十八公斤。
    目前，朝鲜北部各煤矿正在广泛采用先进技术，为在明年生产一千二百万吨煤以提前两年完成五年计划所规定的指标而积极进行准备。
    朝鲜北部的煤矿在战争中受到严重破坏，井上设备全被炸毁，坑道多被水浸而塌落。战后五年多以来，朝鲜工人恢复和扩建了原有的全部矿井，另外还建设了新矿井。
  朝鲜在兄弟国家的援助下，以现代化的机械——电钻、链式和皮带式运输机、电车等装备了各个煤矿。在各个有烟煤矿中，运煤作业的机械化程度已经达到76％以上。今年，每个有烟煤煤矿工人的采煤量比1949年增加了三点四吨，无烟煤矿中的工人的采煤量增加了六点九吨。
    由于普遍推广了劳动英雄金直玄的高速掘进工作法，朝鲜北部煤矿中每个三人掘进小组每月的掘进速度已经由三十到四十公尺提高到一百公尺左右。因此，朝鲜北部今年的采煤量已经比战前的1949年增加了约70％。
    目前，各煤矿正积极准备全面推广水力采煤法，同时继续提高掘进速度。阿吾地、高乾原等著名煤矿最近的日产量已经达到今年年初的二倍。（附图片）
