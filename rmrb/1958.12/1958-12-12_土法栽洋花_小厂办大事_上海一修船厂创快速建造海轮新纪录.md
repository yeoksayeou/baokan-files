Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 11th. The Shanghai Shipyard, whose primary business is repair, launched a mass movement during the Great Leap Forward, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build its first 3,000-ton coastal freighter, the "Peace No. 49." The hull of this ship was launched on the 8th, only thirty-five days from the start of construction to launch. This not only set a new record in China's shipbuilding history for building similar ships, but also faster than Japan's shipbuilding speed. According to the "Science of Ships" magazine published in July 1958, the slipway cycle for Japan to build a 2,500-ton deadweight ocean-going vessel is 45 days.

The Shanghai Shipyard was originally a ship repair factory, which had only built barges and tugboats in the past, and never ocean-going vessels. In the second half of this year, the competition between the Dalian and Jiangnan shipyards inspired the enthusiasm of the Shanghai Shipyard workers. During the rectification campaign, the workers' thinking was greatly liberated, and they also saw the new demands placed on maritime transport by the Great Leap Forward, so they decided to build ocean-going vessels.

Changing from a factory mainly engaged in ship repair to a factory capable of manufacturing ocean-going vessels did indeed present various difficulties. In August, when the leaders of the Shanghai Shipyard mobilized all employees to build ocean-going vessels, there was not even a shadow of a slipway in the factory, and all the lifting equipment was only a few small crawler cranes. Materials were scarce, and the workers lacked experience. Some people thought that shipbuilding under such conditions was impossible.

Faced with this situation, the factory Party organization fully mobilized the masses to discuss and carry out a technical revolution to address the weak links. The workers created many indigenous methods, some of which were new methods never before seen in the shipbuilding industry. These methods greatly enriched China's shipbuilding experience and powerfully proved that shipyards without large equipment can also build ocean-going vessels. The Shanghai Shipyard did not have a slipway, so it built the slipway while building the ship. The slipway design was also completely improved according to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. As a result, the total investment was only one-third of the original, and the time was greatly shortened. For the bottom of the ship, general shipyards have to use a 40-ton crane to lift sections onto the slipway. The largest crane in this factory was only 12 tons. The workers and technicians studied together and used old materials to make a set of skids to replace the crane, sliding the hull sections one by one from the bottom up. When the hull was slid onto the slipway, it could only slide back and forth, not left and right, so the sections did not fit together. Shen Jind, the leader of the carpenter's marking team, etc., used wood to make a rocking tool. When the hull was placed on it, it would fit together completely after rocking it a few times. After the hull was joined, when installing the mast, the height of the crane was not enough again. The crane workers built a "human" shaped wooden frame on the deck using indigenous methods. After the mast was hoisted onto the deck by the crane, it was erected using the wooden frame.

Using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build ships can greatly shorten the time, and the quality of the ship also meets the requirements. The original plan for "Peace No. 49" was to launch it in forty-five days, but the actual time was shortened by ten days compared to the plan. Before the hull was launched, the relevant departments conducted inspections. The welding quality passed X-ray inspection, proving that it met the standards.

This ship is expected to be fully installed by the beginning of next year. Through this practice, the Shanghai Shipyard workers have become more confident. At present, they are mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop indigenous equipment and machine tools in preparation for building larger ocean-going vessels next year. (Attached picture)

### “土法栽洋花”  小厂办大事  上海一修船厂创快速建造海轮新纪录

    “土法栽洋花”  小厂办大事
    上海一修船厂创快速建造海轮新纪录
    新华社上海11日电  以修理为主要业务的上海船厂，在大跃进中发动群众采用土洋结合的办法，第一次建造了一艘载货量三千吨的沿海货轮——“和平四十九号”。这艘海轮的船体已在8日下水，从开始建造到下水只有短短的三十五天，不但创造了我国造船史上建造同类船只的新纪录，并且比日本的造船速度快。据1958年7月份出版的“船的科学”杂志资料，日本建造一艘二千五百吨载重量的海轮，船台周期要四十五天。
    上海船厂原来是一家修船工厂，过去只建造过一些驳船和拖轮，从未造过海轮。今年下半年，大连、江南两个造船厂的竞赛，激发了上海船厂工人的干劲。工人们在整风运动中，思想大大解放，同时看到大跃进的形势对海上运输提出的新的要求，因此，决定动手建造海轮。
    从一个以修船为主的工厂变成一个能够制造海轮的工厂，确实存在着种种困难。8月份，上海船厂领导上向全厂职工动员造海轮时，厂内连船台的影子都没有，所有的起重设备只是几台小型的履带式的吊车，材料很缺乏，工人的经验也不足。有些人认为在这样条件下造船是不可能的事情。
    面对这种情况，工厂党组织全面发动群众进行讨论，针对薄弱环节大搞技术革命。工人们创造了许多土办法，有些还是造船工业上从未有过的新方法，这些方法大大丰富了我国的造船经验，并且有力地证明，没有大设备的修船厂同样能够建造海轮。上海船厂没有船台，就一边造船一边造台，船台设计也完全根据多快好省的原则加以改进，结果全部投资只有原来的三分之一，时间也大大缩短。轮船的船底，一般船厂都要用四十吨的大吊车一段段地吊上船台。这个厂最大的吊车只有十二吨，工人们和技术人员一起研究，就利用旧料制成一套滑架代替吊车，把船体一段段顺次从底下滑上去。船体滑上台时，因为只能前后滑，不能左右滑，段与段之间合不拢，木工放样组组长沈金弟等就用木头做了一个摇摆工具，船体放在上面，只要摇摆几次，就完全合拢了。船身合拢后，安装桅杆时，起重机的高度又不够，起重工人在甲板上用土办法搭了一个“人”字形的木架，桅杆用吊车吊上甲板后，再用木架把它竖立起来。
    采用土洋结合的办法造船，时间可以大大缩短，船的质量也同样符合要求。“和平四十九号”原来计划是四十五天才能下水，结果比计划缩短了十天。船体下水以前，有关部门进行了检查，焊接质量通过爱克司光检验，证明达到标准。
    这艘船预计在明年年初可以全部安装完毕。上海船厂职工通过这次实践，信心更加提高。目前，他们又在发动群众大搞土设备、土机床，为明年建造更大的海轮作准备。（附图片）
    上海船厂用三十五天的时间造了第一艘三千吨海轮，下水后矗立在黄浦江边。
