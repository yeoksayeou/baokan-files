Revolutionary Enthusiasm Must Be Combined with Scientific Spirit
Hou Yong

1958 was a year of overall great leap forward in China's socialist construction and a year of universal increase in the socialist and communist consciousness of the people. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of the people, with their lofty communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and created countless new production records and miracles. The scene of vibrant socialist construction in our country, with all flowers blooming and ten thousand horses galloping, shows that the creative power of the people is inexhaustible under the socialist system, and that anyone who grasps the truth can be unstoppable and invincible. The proponents of the theory of conditions and the dogmatists are already dumbfounded, and even more shocking things are yet to come.

While Developing Vigorous Revolutionary Enthusiasm
Also Advocate Calm Scientific Analysis

Amidst the chorus of victories, we are about to bid farewell to 1958, a year of great victory in China's socialist construction, and welcome 1959, a decisive year in the three years of hard work. Based on the overall leap forward in the national economy in 1958, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward a more ambitious leap forward plan for 1959. In order to smoothly complete the tasks of 1959 and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than this year, we must continue to oppose conservative thinking, break down superstitions, maintain high morale and soaring energy, continue to develop the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and advance courageously with vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm.

However, while we advocate daring to think, speak, and act, and develop lofty revolutionary enthusiasm, we must advocate seeking truth from facts and advocating calm scientific analysis, and closely integrate the two. We are Marxists. "Marxism differs from all other socialist theories in that it remarkably combines two characteristics: on the one hand, it analyzes objective situations and objective evolutionary processes with a completely scientific and calm attitude, and on the other hand, it very firmly recognizes the significance of the revolutionary will, revolutionary creativity, and revolutionary pioneering spirit demonstrated by the masses..." (Lenin: "Against Boycott"). Without vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, being lifeless, not daring to think about things that others have not said, not daring to do things that predecessors have not done, being hesitant and struggling in work, not believing in the creative ability of the masses, standing outside the mass movement picking faults and giving orders, being afraid to promote, and being content to be in the middle, such people cannot be considered promoters. Similarly, relying solely on enthusiasm, without considering objective conditions and actual possibilities, boasting; or thinking that after having advanced indicators, one can be sloppy and careless, then grand ideals will become empty talk, only bearing flowers but no fruit. Empty talk cannot defeat the enemy.

While Emphasizing People's Subjective Initiative
Also Emphasize Objective Practical Possibilities

Dare to think, speak, and act must never be confused with empty talk and exaggeration. The lofty style and ardent revolutionary spirit of communists are based on the knowledge and mastery of objective laws, and are the result of observing the world with a proletarian worldview. The same is true in people's struggle with nature. The bastions of science and technology can certainly be broken through, and the secrets of nature will certainly be revealed by people. However, the concrete solution to each scientific and technological problem often requires hard work, thousands of experiments, breaking through numerous difficulties, and experiencing many failures before a solution can be found. Thus, it can be seen that Chairman Mao has always taught us to despise difficulties strategically and to pay attention to difficulties tactically, to have both soaring energy and a spirit of scientific analysis, which is a reflection of the laws of objective things development and a principle that must be followed in all work. It is wrong to not understand the universal laws of world development, to be timid and self-deprecating, and to bow to difficulties. It is also wrong to not pay attention to studying and analyzing the specific laws of the movement of things, to disregard the specific conditions of the current environment, and to be blindly optimistic.

We communists are dialectical materialists, and we should understand the relationship between subjective initiative and the laws of development of objective things. The victory of the Great Leap Forward fully demonstrates how great the power of people is when they exert subjective initiative after recognizing objective laws. Proponents of the theory of conditions are mechanical materialists in their thinking methods. They regard production only as a pile of dead things such as factories, machines, land, and raw materials, and do not understand at all that machines are operated by people, land is cultivated by people, and the subjective initiative of the masses is a great driving force. Chairman Mao said in his famous book "On Protracted War": "The outcome of a war is certainly determined by the military, political, economic, geographical, the nature of the war, and international assistance conditions of both sides, but it is not determined solely by these; merely having these only gives the possibility of victory or defeat, it itself does not determine victory or defeat. To determine victory or defeat, one must add subjective efforts, that is, guiding the war and carrying out the war, that is, conscious initiative in the war." The fact that China's socialist cause leaped forward and developed in 1958 also shows that when objective conditions are met, whether or not a leap forward can be achieved depends on the decisive role of the policies and lines adopted by the Party. Proponents of the theory of conditions idolize objective conditions, kneel down at the feet of objective conditions, see things but not people, which is completely contrary to Marxism and must be resolutely opposed. However, opposing neglecting people's subjective initiative must never lead to the other extreme, neglecting objective conditions and actual possibilities. After achieving success in their work, some comrades get a little feverish in their minds, thinking that they can do whatever they think of, and develop a style of exaggeration. They disregard actual possibilities and needs, do not conduct thorough investigations and research, and do not consult with the masses. Relying only on their good intentions and good wishes, they order plans and issue orders at a moment's notice, thinking that as long as they think of it, they can do whatever they want. Such exaggeration of subjective initiative goes to its own opposite - subjectivism. It must be pointed out that our criticism of the theory of conditions is by no means a denial of objective conditions and objective laws, thinking that human will can determine everything. On the contrary, we believe that to achieve success and effectiveness in work, it is necessary to thoroughly study objective conditions and make our thoughts and plans conform to objective circumstances. Only by well recognizing objective laws, understanding them, can we skillfully use them, control them, and truly become the masters of nature and society. The clearer the understanding of objective laws and the better the mastery of them, the more fully people can exert subjective initiative. Unfounded assumptions and actions that go beyond objectively permissible conditions can only lead to failure, not a leap forward.

Adhere to the Traditional Style of Seeking Truth from Facts
Plans Should Be Both Advanced and Reliable

We communists transform society according to the laws of social development. Starting from reality and seeking truth from facts is our Party's traditional style and fundamental position. Chairman Mao taught us: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'is' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, regularity, 'seeking' is what we go to study. We must start from the actual situation at home and abroad, inside and outside the province, inside and outside the county, and inside and outside the district, and draw from it its inherent rather than fabricated regularity, that is, find the internal connection of the surrounding events, as a guide to our actions." According to Chairman Mao's instructions, when we make plans and put forward tasks, we must specifically analyze the situation at that time and place, start from objective reality, see both the future prospects and fully estimate the current favorable conditions and difficulties, and at the same time fully estimate the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, to formulate realistic leap forward plans. It both inspires people with advanced indicators and has concrete measures to guarantee it, and at the same time checks and revises it at any time during the implementation. This is the style of seeking truth from facts. Violating this principle, swaying with the wind, acting emotionally, treating subjective wishes as reality, making big plans and shouting empty slogans away from objective and subjective conditions, or only talking about advanced measures without considering concrete measures, and so on, this kind of practice of being divorced from reality, like the right-leaning conservative thinking of being helpless in the face of difficulties, is a subjective style and is extremely harmful to the socialist cause. To adhere to starting from reality, we must conduct serious and in-depth investigation and research in our work and implement the Party's mass line. As long as we fully concentrate the opinions of the masses, we can avoid subjectivity and one-sidedness. In order to avoid one-sidedness, we must also pay attention to being good at patiently listening to and considering opposing opinions, and pay attention to adopting reasonable opposing opinions and the reasonable parts of opposing opinions. We cannot reject them or refuse to consider them just because they do not agree with our own opinions.

The Greater the Achievements
The More We Must Maintain a Clear Head

We have already achieved great victories on all fronts. It is completely wrong to underestimate our achievements. However, we must never neglect the shortcomings in our work because of the great achievements. On the contrary, the greater the achievements, the more we must maintain a clear and calm head. Compared with the achievements, the shortcomings in our work are only a black spot in the sun, not enough to cover its brilliance, but even so, we must see it and pay attention to it. Any shortcomings and errors are detrimental to the people. We are advancing precisely by constantly overcoming shortcomings and errors. To adhere to the attitude of seeking truth from facts, we must take an honest attitude towards the assessment of achievements and shortcomings, say yes if there is, say no if there is no, say good if it is good, say bad if it is bad, neither exaggerate nor minimize. Some people become smug in the midst of a chorus of victories, only willing to listen to achievements, unwilling to listen to shortcomings, liking praise, disliking criticism, and even a few people concealing shortcomings. Its serious harm lies in the fact that the result of doing so will make the leading organs unable to correctly understand the situation, and thus unable to correctly decide on policies and work plans, often causing serious consequences.

In short, adhering to the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, opposing exaggeration, adhering to dialectical materialism, opposing subjectivism, and further improving our work style is of great significance for realizing the even more magnificent 1959 leap forward plan than in 1958.

    革命热情要和科学精神相结合
    侯永
    1958年，是我国社会主义建设事业全面大跃进，人民群众社会主义和共产主义觉悟普遍高涨的一年。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀之下，广大人民以崇高的敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，破除迷信，解放思想，创造了无数新的生产纪录和奇迹。我国社会主义建设百花争艳、万马奔腾的图景，表明在社会主义制度下人民的创造力量是无穷无尽的，表明任何人只要掌握了真理，就能势如破竹，所向披靡。唯条件论者、教条主义者已经目瞪口呆，使他们更吃惊的还在后面。
    既发扬蓬勃的革命热情
    又提倡冷静的科学分析
    在一片胜利声中，我们即将送走1958年，我国社会主义建设取得伟大的胜利的一年；迎接1959年，苦战三年中具有决定性的一年。党的八届六中全会在1958年国民经济全面跃进的基础上，提出了1959年的更加伟大的跃进计划。为了顺利地完成1959年的任务，争取实现比今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，我们必须继续反对保守思想，破除迷信，保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲，继续发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，以蓬勃的革命热情勇往前进。
    但是，在我们提倡敢想敢说敢做，发扬崇高革命热情的同时，必须提倡实事求是，提倡冷静的科学分析，并使两者密切结合起来。我们是马克思主义者，“马克思主义与其它一切社会主义理论不同，它精妙地结合着两种特点：一方面是完全用科学冷静态度来分析客观情势与客观进化行程，另方面极坚决地承认群众所表现的革命毅力，革命创造性和革命首创精神的意义……。”（列宁：“反对抵制”）没有旺盛的革命热情，暮气沉沉，别人没说过的事不敢想，前人没干过的事不敢动，在工作中扭扭捏捏，步履维艰，不相信群众的创造能力，站在群众运动之外挑三剔四，指手划脚，怯于促进，甘居中游，如此这般的人，谈不上什么促进派。同样，单凭一股热情，不考虑客观条件和实际可能性，夸夸其谈；或者以为有了先进指标之后，就可以粗枝大叶，漫不经心，那么，远大的理想就会变成空谈，只开花不结果。空谈是不能战胜敌人的。
    既重视人的主观能动性
    又重视客观实际可能性
    决不能把敢想敢说敢做同空谈、浮夸混同起来。共产主义者崇高的风格和炽热的革命精神，是以认识和掌握客观规律为基础的，是以无产阶级世界观观察世界的结果。在人们同自然界作斗争中，也是这样。科学技术的堡垒一定可以攻破，自然界的秘密一定会被人们揭露。但具体解决每个科学技术问题时，又往往要经过刻苦钻研，千百次试验，突破重重困难，经历多少次失败，才能找到解决办法。由此可见，毛主席历来教导我们在战略上藐视困难、在战术上要重视困难，既要有冲天干劲，又要有科学分析的精神，是客观事物发展规律的反映，是一切工作中必须遵循的原则。不懂世界发展的普遍规律，怯敌自贬，在困难面前低头，是错误的。不重视研究分析事物运动的具体规律，漠视当前环境的具体条件，盲目乐观，也是错误的。
    我们共产党人是辩证唯物主义者，我们应当懂得主观能动性和客观事物发展规律的关系。大跃进的胜利完全表明，人们在认识了客观规律性之后发挥主观能动性，该有多么巨大的力量。唯条件论者，在思想方法上是机械唯物论者。他们把生产只看做是厂房、机器、土地、原料等一堆死东西，完全不懂得机器是靠人开动的，土地是靠人耕种的，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。毛主席在他的名著“论持久战”一书中说：“战争的胜负，固然决定于双方军事、政治、经济、地理、战争性质、国际援助诸条件，然而不仅仅决定于这些；仅有这些，还只是有了胜负的可能性，它本身没有分胜负。要分胜负，还须加上主观的努力，这就是指导战争和实行战争，这就是战争中的自觉的能动性”。1958年我国社会主义事业跃进发展的事实，也说明在客观条件具备的时候，能否跃进，党采取的政策、路线就有决定的作用。唯条件论者把客观条件偶像化，跪倒在客观条件脚下，见物不见人，这是同马克思主义完全背道而驰的，必须坚决反对。但是，反对忽视人的主观能动性，决不能走上另一极端，忽视客观条件和实际可能性。有些同志在工作上取得了成绩之后，脑子有点发热，以为自己想到哪里就可以做到那里，滋长一种浮夸作风。他们不顾实际可能和需要，不进行周密的调查研究，也不跟群众商量，只凭着自己的一片好心和善良的愿望，灵机一动，就订计划、下命令，以为只要想到，就可以随心所欲了。这样夸大主观能动性，就走向了自己的反面——主观主义。必须指出，我们批判唯条件论，决不是否认客观条件和客观规律性，以为人的意志可以决定一切。相反地，我们认为工作要取得成绩，有效果，必须周密地研究客观条件，使自己的思想、计划符合于客观情况。只有很好地承认客观规律，认识它，才能熟练地运用它、支配它，真正做自然界和社会的主人。对客观规律认识得愈清楚，掌握得愈好，人们就愈能充分发挥主观能动性。无根据的设想，超越客观许可的条件去行动，只能引向失败，而不能跃进。
    坚持实事求是的传统作风
        计划要订得既先进又可靠
    我们共产党人是依据社会发展规律来改造社会的。从实际出发，实事求是，是我们党的传统作风和根本立场。毛主席教导我们：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。我们要从国内外、省内外、县内外、区内外的实际情况出发，从其中引出其固有的而不是臆造的规律性，即找出周围事变的内部联系，作为我们行动的向导”。根据毛主席的指示，我们做计划、提任务的时候，必须具体分析当时当地的情况，从客观实际出发，既看到将来的远景，又充分估计到当前的有利条件和困难，同时充分估计到群众的积极性和创造性，来制定切合实际的跃进计划。既使人们为先进指标所鼓舞，又有具体措施加以保证，同时在执行中随时检查修正。这是实事求是的作风。违背这个原则，随风摇摆，感情用事，把主观愿望当作现实，离开主客观条件做大计划，喊空口号，或只空谈先进措施，不考虑具体措施，如此等等，这种脱离实际的作法，同在困难面前束手无策的右倾保守思想一样，是主观主义作风，是对社会主义事业极端有害的。坚持从实际出发，必须在工作中认真深入调查研究，贯彻党的群众路线，只要充分集中了群众意见，就可以避免主观性、片面性。为了避免片面性，还要注意善于耐心地听取和考虑反面意见，注意采纳合理的反对意见和反对意见中的合理部分，不能因为不合己见就顶回去，或拒绝考虑。
    愈是取得巨大的成绩
      愈要保持清醒的头脑
    我们已经在各个战线上取得了伟大的胜利，低估我们的成绩是完全错误的。但是，我们也决不能因为有了巨大成绩，而忽视工作中的缺点，相反地，成绩愈大，我们愈要保持清醒冷静的头脑。我们工作中的缺点同成绩比较起来，只不过是太阳之中的一个黑点，不足以掩盖其万丈光辉，但即使这样，我们也必须看到它，重视它。任何缺点、错误都是对人民不利的。我们正是在不断克服缺点和错误中前进的。坚持实事求是的态度，就必须对成绩和缺点的估计采取老实态度，有就说有，无就说无，好就说好，坏就说坏，既不能夸大，也不能缩小。有些人在一片胜利声中，飘飘然起来，只愿听成绩，不愿听缺点，喜欢表扬，厌恶批评，甚至有少数人隐瞒缺点。它的严重危害在于：这样做的结果，会使领导机关不能正确地了解情况，从而也不能正确地决定政策和工作计划，往往造成严重的恶果。
    总之，坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，反对右倾保守思想，反对浮夸，坚持辩证唯物主义，反对主观主义，进一步改进我们的工作作风，对实现比1958年更为宏伟的1959年跃进计划，是有重要意义的。
