    We Contributed to 10.7 Million Tons of Steel
    Wang Chengliang, Head of the Youth Solidarity Furnace, Second Steelmaking Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel

    Our Youth Solidarity Furnace, on December 16th, completed the annual leap forward plan of 213,000 tons of steel fifteen days ahead of schedule, exceeding the initial national plan by 35,026 tons. The furnace bottom utilization coefficient reached 9.45, an increase of 1.91 compared to the same period last year. The quality of the steel also met national requirements. We are very happy that, in the days when the people of the whole country are fighting to complete the 10.7 million tons of steel, our twenty-one young steelworkers have also contributed.

    Last year, although our Youth Solidarity Furnace also completed the plan ahead of schedule, the results were not very significant. At the beginning of the year, the Party Central Committee put forward the call to surpass Britain within fifteen years, which greatly encouraged us. In September, the Party Central Committee put forward the call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel annually, and our enthusiasm was even greater. The four shifts on our furnace put forward the guarantee of unity, hard work, and mutual creation of favorable conditions. We took the initiative to break the boundaries between shifts,展开ed large-scale cooperation between shifts and individuals, and proposed that four things should be done during handover: not leaving when encountering furnace repair, not leaving when blocking furnace doors, not leaving when tapping steel, and not leaving until the work is finished. During our competition with the then most advanced No. 18 open hearth furnace in the factory, one day, I competed with Zhang Shukong, the famous rapid steelmaking expert of No. 18 open hearth furnace, while being sick. Soon, the comrades in the shift found that this furnace of steel had fallen behind No. 18 furnace, and unanimously proposed to quickly create conditions for the next shift. I adjusted the temperature of the regenerator, and other comrades also made all preparations. Zhuang Futing, the furnace head of the B shift, said with satisfaction when he came to work: You have passed the baton very well. Our shift guarantees to run to the front. In this way, we created conditions for each other and helped each other. In the ten-day overall evaluation, we won the championship in the three aspects of utilization coefficient, steel output, and smelting time.

    We are all young workers, and we don’t have much experience in mastering large open hearth furnaces. Everyone paid special attention to learning advanced experience. We learned the experience of the Youth Friendship Furnace in maintaining the furnace body, changed the ratio of patching materials, and changed the once-a-day blowing of the furnace roof to once per shift. We also learned the experience of rapid steelmaking from No. 16 open hearth furnace. We also developed a set of thermal system, so that our open hearth furnace has always maintained an advanced level.

    In the battle to complete the leap forward plan, we received the care of the Party and the support of all parties everywhere. Repairing ladles, transportation, raw materials, ingot casting, and furnace repair workers all demonstrated the spirit of communist collaboration, doing everything possible to ensure that our open hearth furnace produced more steel. Medical staff and cooks saw that we were working hard and also sent their own prepared ginseng soup and delicious meals to the front of the furnace. Once, the corner of our furnace was burned, but welding the corner required building a false wall inside the furnace. Jin Shixin, Wang Youchen and more than 20 members of the Youth Rocket Team of the Metallurgical Furnace Repair Factory, upon hearing this, immediately put on grass bags soaked in water and jumped into the red-hot furnace without hesitation to build a false wall. In just three minutes, the grass bags were baked dry and caught fire, and some people's eyebrows and hair were scorched, but they came out to drink a sip of ice soda, changed the grass bags, and jumped in again. Finally, they completed the rush repair task in one point and fifteen minutes, ensuring that our open hearth furnace resumed production in time.

    Now, although we have completed the leap forward plan, what we have done is far from enough. Recently, we held a joint meeting of the four shifts and decided to increase production by another 12,000 tons of steel as a gift to the Party and to New Year's Day 1959.

    我们为1070贡献了一份力量
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉炉长  王成良
    我们青年团结炉在12月16日提前十五天超额完成了全年产钢二十一万三千吨的跃进计划，比年初的国家计划增产了三万五千零二十六吨；炉底利用系数达到九点四五，比去年同期增加了一点九一；钢的质量也合乎国家要求。我们感到很高兴，在全国人民为完成一零七零万吨钢而战的日子里，我们二十一个青年炼钢工人也贡献了一份力量。
    去年，我们青年团结炉虽然也提前完成了计划，但成绩还不十分显著。年初，党中央提出十五年内超过英国的号召，大大鼓舞了我们。9月间，党中央又提出了年产一零七零万吨钢的号召，我们的干劲更大了。我们炉子上的四个班，提出了团结苦干，互相创造有利条件的保证。我们主动打破了上下班的界限，展开了班与班、个人与个人之间的大协作，提出在交接班时要做到四不走，即遇到补炉、堵炉门、出钢和活不干完不走。在我们同当时全厂最先进的十八号平炉开展竞赛的过程中，有一天，我带病和十八号平炉著名的快速炼钢能手张述孔竞赛。不久，班上的同志们发现这炉钢已经落在十八号炉后面，一致提出赶紧为下一班创造条件。我调整好了蓄热室温度，别的同志们也做好了一切准备。乙班炉长庄福亭上班一看，满意地说：你们这一捧递的太好了，我们这班保证跑到前面去。这样，我们互相创造条件，互相帮助，十天总评，在利用系数、出钢量和熔炼时间三个方面我们都获得了优胜。
    我们都是青年工人，掌握大型平炉的经验不多，大家都特别注意学习先进经验。我们学习了青年友谊炉维护炉体的经验，改变了补炉材料的配料比，将一天吹一次炉顶改为一班吹一次。又学习了十六号平炉快速炼钢的经验。还研究出了一套热工制度，使我们的平炉一直保持了先进的水平。
    在我们完成跃进计划的战斗中，处处都得到了党的关怀和各方面的支援。修罐、运转、原料、铸锭和修炉工人都发挥了共产主义大协作的精神，尽一切力量保证我们平炉多出钢。医务人员和炊事员见到我们工作紧张，还将他们自己调制的人参汤和可口的饭菜送到炉前。有一次我们的炉子烧坏了拱角，但焊拱角一定要在炉内砌一道假墙。冶金熏炉修理厂青年火箭队的靳世新、王佑臣等二十多名队员听到后，立即披上渗透了水的草袋，毫不迟疑地跳进通红的炉内去砌假墙，只三分钟，草袋就烤干起火了，有人的眉毛、头发也烤焦了，但他们出来喝一口冰汽水、换个草袋，又跳了进去，终于用一点零十五分的时间完成了抢修任务，保证了我们这个平炉及时恢复生产。
    现在，我们虽然已完成了跃进计划，但我们做得还很不够。最近，我们又举行了四班联席会议，决心再增产一万二千吨钢向党、向1959年元旦献礼。
