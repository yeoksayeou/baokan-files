	Reluctant Parting: Deep Affection Between Cadres and Peasants
	Reporter

More than one hundred cadres from the Ministry of Agriculture who were sent to Xuchang County, Henan Province, are about to return to Beijing after more than nine months of labor and training.

On the evening of November 29th, everyone returned to their respective homes after work as usual. However, they no longer had the laughter and lightheartedness of returning home with hoes. When the older women called them to eat, everyone was listless.

"Are you sick?" Aunt Li Songzhi asked with concern, noticing that her expression was not very good.

"No, Auntie, -- Auntie, I'm leaving tomorrow."

"Leaving? Where to? Back to Beijing?"

"Yes!" Songzhi's tears had already flowed, and she couldn't say any more. The aunt, while crying, said: "Why are you leaving so suddenly? Tell them to let you stay for another year!"

The news spread like this, one household after another. Every family wanted to keep their loved ones – the down-to-earth cadres – for a few more days. But they couldn't be kept, so they planned: how to make something good overnight to send off their loved ones, and what souvenirs to give to their beloved children or siblings. That night, no one in any family slept well, making shoes, slaughtering chickens, embroidering pillows... Old man Mao Wenke quietly stewed two large hens and, not satisfied with that, used his savings to buy two pounds of pastries. Songzhi's uncle called Songzhi to his room, took out some money, and wanted to give it to Songzhi as travel expenses, saying, "How can a daughter leave without giving her money?" Songzhi resolutely refused to accept it, and the old man got angry.

Every down-to-earth cadre is a close relative of the farmers here. Now that they are about to leave, who can not be saddened by this parting? When thinking of everyone working together on this land, digging ponds in the spring cold, blocking floods on stormy nights, catching insects, topdressing fertilizer, and breaking off tobacco suckers under the scorching sun... scenes after scenes appeared before people's eyes: Guo Zhaokun wearing a pair of nearsighted glasses, he really looks a bit like an intellectual, but the vigorousness he showed when working was really great. When digging ponds, shovel after shovel, from morning till night, his hands were blistered, but he never complained. In the summer, he braved the scorching heat to fertilize and ridge the fields. The heat in the tobacco fields was stifling, but he didn't care, and he always silently tended the high-yield tobacco field. And there are Zhang Xiyu, He Ruirong, Hu Zhaoling, Kang Xiuwen, Xie Shuixian, Ma Ruiqi... they all worked as hard as Guo Zhaokun. And what the old man in Ma Ruiqi's host family talked about most was not only that Ruiqi worked well, but that when she came home, she would serve and comfort the elderly and help her younger siblings. Early in the morning, she would sweep the yard, pour the bedpan for her grandmother, and cook for her aunt. In the evening, she would encourage her younger siblings to study.

Heroes in the fields and good children in the family, how can they not win the praise of the villagers? What the villagers praised was also the Party schools, agricultural universities, animal husbandry training classes, bacterial fertilizer factories, alcohol factories, weather stations, and farm tool repair stations that they had built single-handedly... What the villagers will never forget is Zhao Wenxiang, who donated his blood to a patient in critical condition; Li Derui and Yin Hongfan, who covered the tobacco leaves with their beloved Guangdong mat and wool blanket to prevent frost; and Sun Qichang, who cured dozens of people of influenza.

The masses love this group of down-to-earth cadres, and the down-to-earth cadres also love their good teachers and friends – the masses. For nearly a year, they learned many farm jobs from the farmers, learned from the local Party and government cadres how to use class analysis to work, how to draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology, and how to care about the interests of the masses... All of this cannot be finished thinking about or talking about in three days and three nights. Now that they are about to say goodbye to their loved ones who care for and educate them, how can they bear to leave? They have to express their feelings to their loved ones before leaving. Two days before the parting, they rushed to plant fifty-two acres of apple orchard day and night. They quickly told their loved ones some of the techniques they knew. Down-to-earth cadre Yang Xiuhua told Old Chen the manufacturing process of bacterial fertilizer over and over again, asking Old Chen to repeat it, and then do it again for her to see. …

The day of parting finally arrived. People, with tears in their eyes, surrounded the car, reluctant to part, saying goodbye to each other, and wishing each other new victories in work and production.

The car slowly started, and the excited crowd waved their hands, calling "Old Ma, Old Guo". When the car drove far away, people still stared at the direction the car was going for a long time, unwilling to leave.

    难舍难分骨肉情
    记者
    农业部下放到河南省许昌县的一百多名干部，经过九个多月的劳动锻炼后，最近就要回北京。
    11月29日晚上，大家还像平日一样，劳动后回到各自的家里去。但是，他们没有了那种往日荷锄而归时的欢笑声和轻快的心情。大娘、婶子招呼吃饭时，一个个都没精打采。
    “是生病了么？”李松芝的大娘看见她的神色有些不大好，关心地问道。
    “不，大娘，——大娘，明天我就要走了”。
    “走？到哪里去？回北京？”
    “嗯！”松芝的眼泪早已流了出来，再也说不下去了。大娘呢，一面哭着，一面说着：为什么走得这样急？给他们说说你再多住上一年吧！”
    消息就像这样一个个地传开了。每一个家庭都想再挽留自己的亲人——下放干部们多住几天。可是留是留不住的了，只好盘算着：怎样用这一夜的时间作点好东西给亲人饯行，预备什么纪念品送给自己心疼的孩子或兄弟姊妹。这一晚，每一个家庭里都没有好好地睡觉，作鞋的作鞋，宰鸡的宰鸡，绣枕头的绣枕头……。毛文科老大爷，悄悄地炖上两只大母鸡还不算，又用自己积攒下来的钱去买来两斤糕点。松芝家的大爷，把松芝叫到他的房里，拿出了几块钱，要给松芝作盘缠，说：“闺女出门，哪有不给钱的？”松芝坚决不收，老大爷还生气。
    每一个下放干部，都是这里的农民们的亲骨肉。如今，他们就要离去，谁能不为这离情别绪而难过呢？一想到大家曾经一起在这块土地上，冒着春寒挖坑塘，在滂沱大雨之夜堵洪水，在火毒的太阳下捉虫、追肥、掰烟岔……一幕幕的情景又都出现在人们的眼前：郭兆坤戴着一副近视眼镜，确实还有点像个知识分子，但是他干起活来那个泼辣劲可真是好样的。挖起坑塘来，一锨又一锨，从早干到黑，手磨起了泡，从不叫累。夏天，他又冒着酷暑施肥、培垅，烟田中的热气蒸人，他也满不在乎，总是不声不响地侍弄着那块烟叶丰产田。还有张锡玉、何瑞荣、胡昭玲、康秀文、谢水仙、马瑞奇……他们也都像郭兆坤一样的努力。而最使马瑞奇住家的那户大爷念叨的，不光是瑞奇劳动好，就是回到家里，也会侍候、安慰老人，帮助弟弟妹妹。清早起来，她就扫院子，给奶奶倒尿罐，给婶子烧锅作饭，晚上回家就鼓励弟弟妹妹们学习。
    田间的英雄，家庭里的好儿女，怎么不博得乡亲们的赞许呢？乡亲们赞许的，还有由他们一手办起来的党校、农业大学、畜牧训练班、细菌肥料厂、酒精厂、气象站、农具修配站、养猪场……乡亲们感念不忘的，还有那把自己的血输给一个危急的病人的赵文祥；那把自己心爱的广东凉席和绒毯给烟叶盖上防霜的李德锐和殷鸿范；那为三十几个人治好了流行性感冒的孙其昌。
    群众热爱这一群下放干部，下放干部也热爱自己的良师益友——群众。将近一年的时间，他们从农民那里学会了许多农活，从当地党和政府的干部中学会了怎样用阶级分析的方法工作，怎样同资产阶级思想划清界限，怎样关心群众的利益……这一切，三天三夜也想不完、说不完。现在，他们就要同关心和教育了自己的亲人们告别了，他们又怎么能够舍得离开？要走了，总得向亲人们表示一番心意。分别的前两天，他们白天黑夜地赶着种了五十二亩苹果园。他们赶紧把自己懂得的一些技术告诉给自己的亲人。下放干部杨秀华，一遍又一遍地把细菌肥料的制造过程告诉了老陈，要老陈照样说一遍，又作一遍给她看。……
    分别的日子终于到了。人们含着眼泪，围着汽车依依难舍，互道珍重，互祝在工作上、生产上取得新的胜利。
    汽车慢慢地开动了，激动的欢送的人群挥着手，“老马、老郭”地叫着，当汽车开得很远的时候，人们还久久的向车行的方向凝望，不肯离去。
