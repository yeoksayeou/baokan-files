　　Semimonthly International Review
　　December 1st – 15th
　　The True Colors of Western Countries Revealed
　　In the past half-month, the struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of war over the Berlin issue has attracted great attention. Since the Soviet Union put forward a peaceful proposal on November 27 regarding ending the foreign occupation of Berlin and making West Berlin a free city, the official figures of Western countries have been greatly panicked. They dared not seriously consider the Soviet proposal, which even many Western bourgeois newspapers admitted was "unassailable." In the past half month, they brazenly distorted the content of the Soviet proposal, slandered the Soviet Union's intentions in putting forward this proposal, saying that "Moscow has invaded West Berlin," and that the United States, Britain, and France "have a responsibility to safeguard the freedom of West Berlin" and "maintain" their "occupation rights." Some people with deranged nerves even clamored to use force on the Berlin issue.

　　In response to all these shameless slanders and mad clamoring, the Soviet Union issued a series of stern and righteous rebuttals. On December 11, TASS was authorized to issue a statement on the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet proposal. On December 12, TASS published Khrushchev's answers to questions from West German reporters on the Berlin issue. On December 13, the Soviet government separately sent notes to the countries of the North Atlantic Group. In these documents, the Soviet Union, with a firm and reasoned attitude, refuted the absurd arguments of Western countries, reaffirmed the Soviet Union's determination to end the Berlin occupation system, and solemnly warned those who clamored for the use of force not to act rashly. At the same time, the Soviet Union pointed out to Western countries the path of conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union in a realistic and calm manner to resolve the Berlin issue.

　　So far, the struggle over the Berlin issue has fully exposed the faces of US, British, and French imperialism, which attempt to prolong the occupation system indefinitely. They are doing everything possible to retain West Berlin as their "cold war" center and military bridgehead, in order to carry out their sinister plans to subvert the German Democratic Republic and attack other countries in the socialist camp.

　　The struggle over the Berlin issue has also fully exposed the faces of the Adenauer clique in West Germany, who are betraying national interests. For the sake of their ulterior revanchist plans, they even clamor to continue to trap West Berlin, which has belonged to the German people for generations, under the occupation of foreign troops. In sharp contrast to this, the national leaders of the German Democratic Republic, in order to ease the tense situation in Germany and Europe, and to benefit the cause of peaceful reunification of Germany, are willing to make sacrifices and agree to make West Berlin, which should have been incorporated into the capital of the Republic, a free city.

　　The struggle over the Berlin issue has also fully exposed how ridiculous the so-called "unity" of Western countries is! For example, while Britain joins West Germany in slandering the Soviet proposal, it takes the opportunity to ask West Germany to make concessions to Britain on the issue of the "free trade zone" in exchange for Britain's support for West Germany on the Berlin issue. The British ruling Conservative Party's "Daily Express" clearly stated that "Britain's interests are not the same as West Germany's interests" on the Berlin issue, and meaningfully calculated the old accounts of Hitler's Germany "bombing Britain and making the British people suffer," claiming that "historically, morally, and financially... Britain has no reason to bear the burden of Berlin." Of course, this threat from Britain is not only aimed at West Germany, but also at the US, the behind-the-scenes string-puller of West Germany. Therefore, Dulles had to hurriedly convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany to create the so-called "unity" of Western countries on the Berlin issue.

　　Western countries have revealed their true colors on the Berlin issue. Their insistence on a stubborn position will only lead to failure.

　　The Loud Clarion of the African People
　　The struggle of the African people for national independence has recently seen vigorous development. The "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" held on December 1 and the All-African People's Conference held on December 8 fully demonstrated the momentum and strength of the African national independence movement.

　　The call by the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" on December 1 has been warmly responded to by peace-loving people all over the world. The Asian-African Solidarity Committees of the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, Burma, and other countries have successively issued statements expressing their support; grand rallies have also been held in Moscow, Hanoi, Jakarta, New Delhi, and other places to severely condemn imperialism. "Imperialism get out of Africa!" This loud clarion call resounded throughout Africa and Asia. It heralds that the Asian and African people will further unite and take action to fight for the complete destruction of the colonial system and for independence and freedom.

　　The All-African People's Conference held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, was the largest non-governmental gathering ever held in Africa. More than 300 representatives from 62 organizations in 28 countries participated in the conference. In their speeches, they angrily exposed the monstrous crimes committed by imperialists in Africa and severely condemned Western colonialists. The meeting passed important declarations and resolutions on colonialism and imperialism, and on the withdrawal of colonial countries. These declarations and resolutions strongly condemned the sinful colonial system, pointing out that in French and British colonies, local residents suffered greatly from colonialism and racism, and were deprived of human dignity and democratic rights. Imperialists also used extremely cruel forms to plunder and exploit the natural resources and manpower of these regions. Therefore, in order for the African people to truly enjoy independence, freedom, and democratic rights, the resolution demanded that Western colonialists immediately stop political oppression and economic plunder of Africa, and withdraw from the territories they occupied. All of these reflected the strong desire of the African people to strive for independence and freedom, and their determination to drive imperialism out of the entire African continent.

　　This conference is a symbol of the great unity of the African people. Imperialists attempted to influence the conference through despicable activities, thereby undermining the unity of the African people. The United States sent a large number of "observers" to attend the conference, running around everywhere. However, the imperialists' conspiracy failed once again. The speeches and resolutions of the conference have always been imbued with the spirit of African people demanding unity. It is certain that this conference will greatly strengthen the unity among the African people and powerfully promote the development of the African national independence movement. The day when imperialism gets out of Africa is not far away.

　　American Conspiracy in the Middle East
　　Since the American armed aggression against the Middle East was defeated, the entire situation in the Middle East has continued to develop in a direction favorable to the national independence movement. But American imperialism is very unwilling to give up. "It is difficult to alter one's nature," American imperialism has not learned any historical lessons. Recently, it is trying every means to promote a new plan of aggression in the Middle East.

　　As early as November, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining and Secretary of Defense McElroy came to the Middle East one after another to conduct activities to sign bilateral military treaties with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. According to various sources, according to the US-Iran military treaty, the United States will establish missile bases and submarine bases in Iran, and will station troops in Iran. The military treaties signed by the United States with Turkey and Pakistan also have similar content. This proves that these military treaties infringe upon the territorial sovereignty of the Middle Eastern contracting countries and threaten the security of the Middle East. The main aggressive target of the United States in creating these new military treaties is the national independence movement of Arab countries. The United States intends to use these bilateral military treaties to replace the Baghdad Pact, which has lost its soul, and completely turn it into an American tool of aggression in the Middle East.

　　At the same time, the United States is conducting insidious political activities in the Middle East: one is subversion, and the other is division. On December 6, US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree began a "visit" to the Middle East. These two kinds of poison are hidden in his gourd. In order to put a sugar coating on the poison, it is said that Rountree also intends to provide some "financial assistance" and the like to Middle Eastern countries. However, although Rountree is as cunning as a fox, he is playing the role of a street rat that everyone shouts and beats in the Middle East. Middle Eastern public opinion has revealed that Rountree is an ominous thing. His visit to the Middle East this time is to provoke the unity among the people of Arab countries, and to plot to carry out sabotage activities against those Arab countries that insist on implementing national independence policies.

　　American news agencies have recently clamored about Iraq being threatened by so-called "communism," which is the excuse and signal for imperialism to attempt to subvert the Republic of Iraq. On December 8, the Iraqi government announced that it had cracked a major subversion conspiracy case involving foreigners. Many newspapers in Baghdad have pointed out that this conspiracy case is related to the United States. This is obviously a very noteworthy event.

　　However, the situation is very unfavorable to the United States. The military treaties signed by the United States with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan have been severely condemned and warned by the Middle East and related countries. Rountree's "visit" hit a snag in Lebanon at the very beginning: Lebanese Prime Minister Karami announced that Lebanon is "completely impossible" to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." It can be seen that the American conspiracy is difficult to succeed.

    半月国际述评
    12月1日——15日
    西方国家原形毕露
    过去半月中，和平力量和战争势力之间在柏林问题上的斗争，吸引了人们的极大注意。自从苏联在11月27日提出了关于结束外国对柏林的占领、使西柏林成为自由城市的和平建议以后，西方国家的官方人物大为恐慌。他们不敢认真考虑苏联这一项即使许多西方资产阶级报刊也承认是“无懈可击”的建议。他们在过去的半月中，放肆地歪曲苏联的建议的内容，诽谤苏联提出这项建议的用意，说什么“莫斯科侵犯了西柏林”，美、英、法三国“有职责维护西柏林的自由”、“维护”它们的“占领权利”，某些神经失常的人更叫嚣要在柏林问题上使用武力。
    对于所有这些无耻诽谤和疯狂叫嚣，苏联给予了一系列义正词严的回击。12月11日塔斯社受权就西方国家对待苏联的建议的态度发表了声明，12日塔斯社发表了赫鲁晓夫的就柏林问题答西德记者问，13日苏联政府分别照会北大西洋集团各国。在这些文件中，苏联以坚定的说理态度把西方国家的那些荒谬论调驳得体无完肤，重申苏联的结束柏林占领制度的决心，严肃地警告那些叫嚣使用武力的人不得轻举妄动。同时，苏联向西方国家指出了以实事求是的、冷静的态度同苏联一道进行谈判以解决柏林问题的道路。
    迄今为止，在柏林问题上的斗争，已经充分暴露了美、英、法帝国主义企图无限期地延长占领制度的面目。他们千方百计地要保留西柏林继续作为他们的“冷战”中心和军事桥头堡，以便实行他们的颠复德意志民主共和国和进攻社会主义阵营其他国家的罪恶计划。
    柏林问题上的斗争，也充分暴露了西德阿登纳之流出卖民族利益的面目。他们为了自己的不可告人的复仇计划，竟然叫嚷要把世世代代属于德国人民的西柏林继续陷于外国军队的占领下。与此截然相反，德意志民主共和国国家领导人为了缓和德国和欧洲的紧张局势，为了有利于德国的和平统一事业，宁愿作出牺牲，同意使本来应该并入共和国首都的西柏林成为一个自由城市。
    柏林问题上的斗争，还充分暴露了西方国家的所谓“团结”是多么滑稽！譬如，英国一方面同西德一起诬蔑苏联的建议，另一方面却趁机要西德在“自由贸易区”的问题上向英国让步，以交换英国在柏林问题上对西德的支持。英国执政的保守党的“每日快报”明白地表示在柏林问题上“英国的兴趣同西德的兴趣不一样”，并且意味深长地算起希特勒德国“曾轰炸英国，使英国人民吃足苦头”的老账，声称“从历史上、道义上、财政上……英国都没有理由承担柏林的负担”。当然，英国这种威胁，不仅是针对着西德，实际上也是瞄准着西德的幕后牵线人美国的。因此，杜勒斯又不得不匆匆召集美、英、法和西德的四国外长会议，搞西方国家在柏林问题上的所谓“团结”了。
    西方国家在柏林问题上已原形毕露。他们坚持顽固立场，只会招致失败的后果。
    非洲人民的响亮号角
    非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争最近又有蓬勃的发展。12月1日举行的“帝国主义滚出非洲日”和在12月8日召开的全非人民大会，充分地显示了非洲民族独立运动的声势和力量。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处关于在12月1日举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”的号召，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈响应。苏联、中国、蒙古、缅甸等国亚非团结委员会先后发表声明表示支持；在莫斯科、河内、雅加达、新德里等地还举行盛大集会，对帝国主义进行了严厉的谴责。“帝国主义滚出非洲去！”这个宏亮的号角响遍了非洲，也响遍了亚洲。它预告亚非人民将进一步团结起来，行动起来，为彻底摧毁殖民制度、争取独立自由而斗争。
    在加纳首都阿克拉召开的全非人民大会，是第一次在非洲举行的规模最大的民间性集会。共有二十八个国家的六十二个组织的三百多名代表参加了这次大会，他们在发言中愤怒地揭发了帝国主义者在非洲所犯的滔天罪行，并对西方殖民者进行了严厉的谴责。会议通过了关于殖民主义和帝国主义问题、关于要求殖民国家撤走等重要宣言和决议。这些宣言和决议强烈地谴责了罪恶的殖民制度，指出在法属和英属殖民地中，当地居民备受殖民主义和种族主义的迫害，被剥夺了人类尊严和民主权利。帝国主义者并且采取极其残酷的形式，对这些地区的天然资源和人力进行掠夺和剥削。因此，为了使非洲人民能真正享受独立自由和民主权利，决议要求西方殖民主义者立即停止对非洲的政治压迫和经济掠夺，并从它们所占领的领土上撤走。所有这些都反映了非洲人民争取独立自由的强烈愿望和要把帝国主义从整个非洲赶出去的决心。
    这次大会是非洲人民大团结的标志。帝国主义者企图通过卑鄙的活动，对会议施加影响，从而破坏非洲人民的团结。美国派遣了大批“观察员”出席会议，到处奔走。但是，帝国主义者的阴谋又一次落了空。大会的发言和决议始终贯穿着非洲人民要求团结一致的精神。可以肯定，这次会议将大大加强非洲人民之间的团结，并有力地推动非洲民族独立运动的发展。帝国主义滚出非洲的日子，不会是很远了。
    美国在中东的阴谋活动
    自从美国武装侵略中东遭到失败以后，整个中东局势正在沿着有利于民族独立运动的方向继续发展。但是美帝国主义是十分不甘心的。“江山易改，秉性难移”，美帝国主义一点也没有接受历史教训，近来它正千方百计地在中东推行新的侵略计划。
    还在11月间，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁和国防部长麦克耳罗伊就先后到中东来，进行了同伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦签订双边军事条约的活动。据各方面透露，根据美国—伊朗军事条约，美国将在伊朗建立导弹基地和潜艇基地，并将在伊朗驻扎军队。美国同土耳其、巴基斯坦签订的军事条约，也具有类似的内容。这就证明，这些军事条约侵犯了中东缔约国的领土主权，并且威胁了中东的安全。而美国所以要制造这些新的军事条约，其主要的侵略矛头还是指向阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动的。美国打算用这几个双方军事条约来代替失了魂的巴格达条约，从而把它完全变为美国在中东的侵略工具。
    在这同时，美国又对中东国家进行阴险的政治活动：一是颠复，二是分化。12月6日，美国助理国务卿朗特里开始“访问”中东，他的葫芦里藏的就是这两样毒药。为了给毒药包上一层糖衣，据说朗特里也打算对中东国家提供一点“财政援助”之类的东西。但是，朗特里虽然像狐狸一样狡猾，他在中东扮演的却是人人喊打的过街老鼠的角色。中东各国舆论纷纷揭露，朗特里是个不祥之物。他这次到中东来，是想挑拨阿拉伯各国人民之间的团结，并阴谋对那些坚持执行民族独立政策的阿拉伯国家进行破坏活动。
    美国通讯社近来大肆叫嚷伊拉克受到所谓“共产主义威胁”等等，这正是帝国主义企图颠复伊拉克共和国的借口和信号。12月8日，伊拉克政府宣布破获了一件有外国人合谋的重大颠复阴谋案。巴格达许多报纸已经指出，这个阴谋案是同美国有关的。这显然是一个非常值得注意的事件。
    但是，形势对美国十分不利。美国同伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦签订军事条约，已经受到中东和有关国家的严重谴责和警告。朗特里的“访问”一开头就在黎巴嫩碰了一个不小的钉子：黎巴嫩总理卡拉米宣布黎巴嫩“完全不可能”接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。可以看出，美国的阴谋活动是很难得逞的。
