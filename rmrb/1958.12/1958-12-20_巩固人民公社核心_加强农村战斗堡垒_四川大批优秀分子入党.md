    Consolidate the Core of People's Communes  Strengthen Rural Fortresses
    A Large Number of Outstanding Elements in Sichuan Join the Party

    (Reported by our newspaper) To adapt to the new situation after the Great Leap Forward in rural areas, Party organizations at all levels in Sichuan Province are actively strengthening the work of accepting new Party members in rural areas.  In the past two months or so, many activists who have been educated and examined over a long period and have communist awareness have joined the Party in various places.  Statistics from Wanxian, Leshan, Nanchong, Luzhou and other regions alone show that more than 10,000 new Party members have been accepted.

    On the basis of the rectification campaign last year, and through this year's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, especially the people's commune movement and the nationwide iron and steel smelting campaign, the communist thinking of the broad masses of peasants in Sichuan has soared unprecedentedly. After the implementation of the "Four Transformations" in people's communes in various places, the organization and discipline of the peasant masses have been further improved. At present, a large number of rural activists who are willing to resolutely struggle for socialism and communism and actively request to join the Party have emerged throughout the province.

    Since September, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan have actively strengthened their leadership in the work of accepting new Party members.  Various localities have closely combined this with the central work, educating activists applying to join the Party through various means, and individually accepting those who meet the conditions into the Party according to organizational procedures.  The Wanxian Prefectural Party Committee and the county Party committees under its jurisdiction have held special meetings to make arrangements. Many township and commune Party organization leaders have personally taken on the work of developing the Party. Party organizations at all levels in Leshan, Jiangjin and other regions have assigned special personnel to be in charge of this work, and have adopted various forms such as centralized study, Party lectures, small-scale seminars, and individual talks to educate the masses. Most of the new Party members accepted in various places are "joining the Party on the firing line."

    The newly accepted rural Party members are generally of good class background, have a firm stance, have a communist ideological consciousness, have close ties with the masses, have a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to fight against backward ideas; are familiar with agriculture, dare to create, and constantly promote technological innovation. Zhang Mingyun, a new Party member in Qiaoting Township, Wusheng County, has always been good at production and active in his work. In deep plowing, he resolutely opposed the idea of extensive planting and low yields. He took the lead in improving tools and working with the masses to rush to cultivate the land, completing the plowing plan one week ahead of schedule, which promoted production throughout the township. Sixteen of the eighteen new Party members recently accepted in Shuanghe District, Yingshan County, are models of production or work in the Great Leap Forward. As a large number of women participate in production, the number of women joining the Party has also greatly increased. Women account for more than 20% of the newly accepted Party members in Naxi County.

    The strengthening of rural Party organizations has played a significant role in further strengthening the Party's leadership and consolidating the people's communes. More than 100 rural Party members in Liemian District, Wusheng County, were transferred to support industry this year. After communization, many production teams had few or even no Party members. Recently, after this district accepted a group of new Party members, this situation changed. Under the leadership of all Party members and activists, a vigorous campaign for large-scale and high-yield spring crops was quickly launched throughout the district. (Yu Jingqi)

### 巩固人民公社核心  加强农村战斗堡垒  四川大批优秀分子入党

    巩固人民公社核心  加强农村战斗堡垒
    四川大批优秀分子入党
    本报讯  为了适应农村大跃进后的新形势，中共四川省各级党组织积极加强农村接受新党员的工作。最近两个多月，各地已有许多经过长期考察、教育，具有共产主义觉悟的积极分子入党。仅万县、乐山、南充、泸州等专区的统计，新接受的党员已达一万人以上。
    在去年整风的基础上，通过今年工农业大跃进，特别是人民公社化和全民炼铁炼钢运动，四川广大农民群众共产主义思想空前高涨。各地人民公社实行“四化”以后，更进一步提高了农民群众的组织性和纪律性。目前，全省各地都涌现了大批愿为社会主义和共产主义坚决奋斗，并积极要求入党的农村积极分子。
    从9月份以来，四川各级党委都积极加强了对接受新党员工作的领导，各地紧密结合中心工作，通过多种多样的方式向申请入党的积极分子进行教育，按照组织手续个别地接受他们中条件具备的人入党。中共万县地委和所属各县委都召开了专门会议进行安排，许多乡和公社党组织负责人都亲自担任发展党的工作。乐山、江津等地区各级党组织都有专人分管这一工作，并采取了集中学习、上党课、小型座谈、个别谈话等多种多样形式向群众进行教育。各地接受的新党员，绝大部分都是“火线入党”的。
    被接受的农村新党员，一般都是成分好、立场坚定；有共产主义思想觉悟，和群众有密切联系；有敢想、敢说、敢做和敢于向落后思想作斗争的共产主义风格；熟悉农业，敢于创造，不断地推进技术革新。武胜县桥亭乡新党员张明云一贯生产好，工作积极，在深耕中他坚决反对广种薄收的思想，自己带头改进工具，和群众一道抢耕，提前一星期完成翻地计划，推动了全乡生产。营山县双河区最近接受的十八名新党员，有十六名都是大跃进中的生产或工作模范。由于妇女大批参加生产，妇女入党的人数也大大增加。纳溪县新接受的党员中妇女占20％以上。
    农村党组织的壮大，对进一步加强党的领导，巩固人民公社，起了重大作用。武胜县烈面区今年先后调出一百多农村党员支援工业，公社化后有许多生产队党员很少甚至没有。最近，这个区接受了一批新党员后，就改变了这种情况。在全体党员、积极分子带头下，全区很快就开展了轰轰烈烈的小春作物大面积高产运动。  （于竞祁）
