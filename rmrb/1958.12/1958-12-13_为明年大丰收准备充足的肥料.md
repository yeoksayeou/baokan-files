To strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production, fertilizer is an extremely important key. "Crops bloom because of fertilizer," "Without ten thousand dan of fertilizer, it's hard to harvest ten thousand jin of grain," these sayings all illustrate the causal relationship between fertilizer and crop yield. Analyzing the progress of agricultural production in China over the past three years from the perspective of fertilization levels is also very interesting. In 1956, the nationwide fertilization level generally increased, approximately 2,500 jin per mu were applied, and grain, cotton, and other crops took a big leap forward; in 1957, the fertilization level increased only slightly, and the increase in grain and other crops was not significant; in 1958, the fertilization level increased dramatically, leaping again and again, with an average increase of ten to twenty times compared to last year, and crops achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Next year is a year of decisive significance in the three-year hard battle to change the face of the motherland, and the yield of various crops must be greatly increased, which requires the preparation of sufficient fertilizer. Especially in carrying out the mass high-yield movement and gradually implementing the basic farmland system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest, a large amount of various fertilizers is needed as a guarantee. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to implement the instructions on fertilizer issues issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 29, with natural fertilizer as the main focus, to fully develop the fertilizer accumulation and production movement, to improve both the quantity and quality of fertilizer, and at the same time to grasp the work of accumulating, producing, sowing, preserving, transporting, and applying fertilizer, and to do a good job in all aspects.

Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce jointly held a national on-site promotion meeting for fertilizer accumulation and production in Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, to study and discuss how to prepare sufficient fertilizer for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. This is a timely and important meeting. From this meeting, it can be seen that we have accumulated extremely rich experience in accumulating and producing fertilizer during this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. In terms of accumulating and producing organic fertilizer, there are truly a variety of methods, blooming everywhere. In terms of manufacturing inorganic fertilizer, a mass method of manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizer has also been created. Therefore, the fertilizer accumulation and production movement of large-scale accumulation of natural fertilizer, large-scale production of indigenous chemical fertilizer, and vigorous planting of green manure this winter and next year, if grasped well, will surely achieve great results.

On the fertilizer issue, there are now some incorrect statements. One is the "limited fertilizer source theory," which believes that after digging and digging, the fertilizer is almost exhausted, and therefore expresses doubts about whether a lot of fertilizer can be found again. Is this statement correct? Of course not. The many facts that have emerged in China's great leap forward in agricultural production this year have refuted this argument. Facts have proved that in the past year, not only has the fertilizer source not been exhausted, but also due to the improvement of fertilizer accumulation technology and the widespread development of fertilizer production using indigenous methods, the avenues for fertilizer accumulation and production have become wider and wider, and the fertilizer source has become richer and richer. Now, in addition to using human and animal manure, river mud, pond mud, and some plants to produce fertilizer, many areas can also use ore, brine, seawater, and soot to manufacture indigenous chemical fertilizer. Therefore, when looking for fertilizer sources, we should not only focus on the current commonly used fertilizer sources, but should cast our eyes in all directions, looking for new fertilizer production raw materials above and below ground, on land and in water. Since last winter, Anhui Province has discovered hundreds of methods for making fertilizer, which can be summarized in ten characters: "smoke, burn, dig, exchange, sweep, shovel, ferment, pile, pick, and scoop." Smoked fertilizer alone has more than 100 methods. They adopted a variety of methods and produced a total of 560 billion dan of fertilizer, which is more than 26 times the total accumulated fertilizer in the eight years since liberation, with an average of 6,300 dan per mu. Now they have made a new plan, requiring the fertilizer accumulated and produced this winter and next spring to reach 5,000 dan per mu. Not only Anhui, but also many other provinces have had many methods and a wide range of fertilizer sources for fertilizer accumulation this year. At the National On-site Promotion Meeting for Fertilizer Accumulation and Production held in Zhejiang Province, a resounding slogan was put forward: "Let household fertilizer go out, mineral fertilizer come out of the soil, mountain fertilizer go down the mountain, sea fertilizer land, water fertilizer ashore, and develop and utilize all fertilizer sources!" This is very meaningful.

Another argument is the "fertilization limit theory," which believes that fertilization is already a lot, has reached the so-called "limit," cannot be increased further, and any more will cause lodging and problems. Therefore, there are doubts about whether so much fertilizer needs to be found. Is this statement correct? Let's look at the facts: this year, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased by ten to twenty times compared to last year, and there are many places where about 100,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu, and some high-yield fields have even applied 200,000 to 300,000 jin of fertilizer. These facts are unimaginable for those who believe in the "fertilization limit theory," but the facts are indeed ironclad facts. With so much fertilizer applied, the crops not only did not have problems, but also achieved a bumper harvest. The increase in agricultural production in China this year is something that cannot be found in books, and some outdated theories should no longer be blindly believed. Of course, we do not deny that the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland should have a reasonable limit as a standard for fertilization, but this reasonable limit is not the fertilization "limit" envisioned by those who believe in the "fertilization limit theory" based on outdated book knowledge. So, to what extent can the amount of fertilizer applied to the land not be increased any further? Future production practice and scientific experiments will provide the correct answer. However, the current actual situation is that the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland in various parts of China is not already excessive, but is still far from enough. Precisely because of this, it has recently been decided in various places that the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of large-area high-yield fields next year will be as high as tens of thousands of jin or even hundreds of thousands of jin. Our experience is that we want a lot of fertilizer and skillful application of fertilizer. This means that on the one hand, we must apply a large amount of fertilizer, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to combining fertilization with deep plowing, irrigation, soil improvement, promotion of improved varieties, and rational close planting. At the same time, we must also pay attention to applying fertilizer in layers and according to the needs of crops, so that crops can eat their fill and eat well. As long as we do these things, we can guarantee high yields.

In fertilizer accumulation and production, improving the quality of fertilizer is of great significance. In many places, the quantity of fertilizer accumulated and produced is very large, which has greatly increased the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland, but because the quality of fertilizer is not high, the effect of increasing production in farmland is not large enough compared to the manpower spent on fertilizer accumulation, production, and transportation. If the quality of fertilizer can be greatly improved, not only can the fertilizer efficiency be increased and production be promoted more effectively, but also the labor force spent on fertilizer accumulation, production, and transportation can be saved. The improvement of fertilizer quality can also promote the improvement of fertilization tools and methods, which is conducive to gradually realizing the gardenization of cultivation and the industrialization of agriculture. The so-called improvement of fertilizer quality not only refers to increasing the fertilizer efficiency of each fertilizer, but also refers to increasing the variety of fertilizers, and the fine fertilizer needed to increase crop production. Therefore, we should implement the policy of mainly using organic fertilizer; on the one hand, accumulate and produce high-quality farm fertilizer, and on the other hand, use various raw materials to produce indigenous chemical fertilizer on a large scale. At present, people's communes in many provinces have already established tens of thousands of indigenous chemical fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, and bacterial fertilizer plants. Now, we should consolidate these fertilizer plants based on resource conditions, and take measures such as fixing personnel, fixing equipment, fixing quality, and fixing quantity.

At present, people's communes in various places are beginning to take measures to develop diversified economies, and fertilizer accumulation and production can be coordinated with the development of diversified economies. For example, planting more green manure and using green manure as feed to raise pigs in large quantities can not only develop the pig-raising industry, but also increase fertilizer, which is a double benefit. Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, used large-scale planting of feed crops and large-scale pig raising to solve the fertilizer problem this year. This experience is very good and should be promoted.

In order to effectively do a good job in fertilizer accumulation and production, it is also necessary to widely publicize scientific knowledge about fertilization to farmers, so that farmers understand the main uses of various fertilizers. In this way, when they accumulate and produce fertilizer, they can pay attention to the specifications and quality of various fertilizers; when they apply fertilizer, they can also use various fertilizers more rationally and give full play to the fertilizer efficiency of various fertilizers. Scientific education on fertilizer can be carried out in a planned way as a part of the production technology course in rural red and expert schools.

To break through the fertilizer barrier, we must liberate our minds and invest in the fertilizer accumulation and production movement with full confidence. Therefore, all localities must conduct in-depth political and ideological work, and through mass airing of views, mass blooming, big-character posters, and mass debates, criticize and correct various incorrect views and working methods, so that the fertilizer accumulation and production movement can be carried out more deeply and more extensively, creating a very reliable condition for a greater harvest next year.

### 为明年大丰收准备充足的肥料

    为明年大丰收准备充足的肥料
    争取农业生产大跃进，肥料是极其重要的一关。“庄稼一朵花，全靠肥当家”，“没有万担肥，难收万斤粮”，这些话都说明了肥料和农作物产量的因果关系。近三年来我国农业生产的进展情况，从施肥水平上来分析，也是很有意思的。1956年，全国的施肥水平普遍提高了，大约每亩施肥二千五百斤，粮棉等各项农作物就大大地向前跃进了一步；到1957年，施肥水平提高得有限，粮食及其他农作物增产幅度也不算大；到1958年，施肥水平突飞猛进，一跃再跃，平均每亩施肥比去年增加十倍到二十倍，农作物也就获得了史无前例的丰收。
    明年，是苦战三年改变祖国面貌具有决定性意义的一年，各项农作物的产量还要大大跃进，这就需要准备好充足的肥料。尤其在开展大面积高额丰产运动，逐步实行少种、高产、多收的基本农田制的情况下，更需要有大量的各种各样的肥料作为保证。因此，必须继续贯彻执行中共中央8月29日发布的关于肥料问题的指示，以自然肥料为主，全面开展积肥造肥运动，既要提高肥料的数量，又要提高肥料质量，同时要把积肥、制肥、种肥、保肥、运肥、施肥各项工作都抓起来，并且要抓得很好。
    最近，农业部、化工部、商业部联合在浙江省余杭县召开了全国积肥造肥现场促进会议，研究和讨论了如何为明年农业生产更大跃进准备充足的肥料的问题，这是一个及时的重要的会议。从这个会议上看出，在今年农业生产大跃进中，我们已经积累了极其丰富的积肥和造肥经验。在积制有机肥料方面，办法真是多种多样，遍地开花。在制造无机肥料方面，又创造了群众性的制造土化肥的办法。因此，今冬和明年的大积自然肥、大搞土化肥和大力种植绿肥的积肥造肥运动，只要抓好了，一定可以得到很大的成绩。
    在肥料问题上，现在有些错误说法，一种是“肥源有限论”，认为挖来挖去，肥料差不多挖空了，因此对能不能再找到很多的肥料，表示怀疑。这种说法对不对呢？当然不对。今年我国农业生产大跃进中出现的许许多多的事实，已经驳倒了这个论调。事实证明，近一年来，不但肥源没有挖空，而且由于积肥技术的提高和用土法制化肥的广泛发展，积肥造肥的门路越来越广阔，肥源也越来越丰富了。现在，许多地区除了利用人畜粪便、河泥塘泥和部分植物造肥以外，还能利用矿石、卤水、海水和烟灰等制造土化肥。因此，在寻找肥源的时候，我们不能只着眼于眼前的若干惯用的肥源上面，而应当目光四射，向地上地下、陆地水里寻找新的制肥原料。安徽省自去年冬季以来，发现了数百种搞肥料的办法，归纳起来是十个字：“熏烧挖换扫，铲沤堆拾捞”，仅熏肥就有一百多种办法。他们采用多种多样的办法，共搞了五千六百亿担肥料，为解放八年来积肥总和的二十六倍多，平均每亩地可施六千三百担。现在他们又作了新的计划，要求今冬明春积制的肥料，达到每亩能施用五千担。不仅安徽，其他许多省份今年积肥也是办法极多，肥源极广。在浙江省召开的全国积肥造肥现场促进会议上，就提出了一个响亮的口号：“让家肥出门，矿肥出土，山肥下山，海肥登陆，水肥上岸，把一切肥源开发利用起来！”这是很有意义的。
    另一种论调是“施肥极限论”，认为施肥已经很多了，已经到了所谓“极限”，不能再多了，再多就要倒伏，要出毛病，因此对需不需要找这么多肥料，表示怀疑。这种说法对不对呢？还是看看事实吧：今年每亩施肥是比去年增加十倍到二十倍，每亩施肥十万斤左右的地方很多，有的高额丰产田还施肥二三十万斤。这些事实对于“施肥极限论”者说来是不可想像的，可是事实的确是铁一般的事实，施了这么多肥料，农作物不但没有出毛病，而且获得了丰收。我国农业今年的增产幅度本来就是书本上找不到的，一些过了时的理论不应该再迷信了。当然我们不否认农田的施肥量应当有一个合理的限度作为施肥的标准，但是这个合理的限度却不是“施肥极限论”者根据旧的书本知识所设想的那个施肥“极限”。那么土地的施肥量究竟达到什么程度就不能再增加了？这个问题，将来的生产实践和科学试验是会作出正确的答案的。但是，现在的实际情况是：我国各地的农田施肥量不是已经过多，而是还很不够。正因为如此，最近各地才决定来年的大面积丰产田的每亩平均施肥量多达十几万斤以至几十万斤。我们的经验是又要肥料多，又要施肥巧。这就是说，一方面要大量施肥，一方面要注意施肥与深耕、灌溉、土壤改良、推广良种、合理密植等措施结合起来。同时，还要注意分层施肥和按作物需要施肥，让庄稼吃饱吃好，只要做到了这些，就能保证高额丰产。
    在积肥造肥中，提高肥料的质量，有重要意义。有不少地方积肥造肥数量很大，使得农田的施肥量大大增加了，但是由于肥料的质量不高，农田的增产效果同在积肥造肥运肥上所花费的人力比较起来，还不够大。如果能大力提高肥料质量，不但可以增大肥效，更有效地促进增产，而且可以节省在积肥造肥运肥方面所花的劳动力。肥料质量的提高，还可以促进施肥工具和施肥方法的改进，便于逐步实现耕作园田化和农业工厂化。所谓提高肥料质量，不仅指的是增加每一种肥料的肥效，而且指的是增加肥料的品种，增产农作物所需要的细肥。因此，应当贯彻以有机肥料为主的方针；一方面积制质量良好的农家肥料，另方面要利用各种原料大制土化肥。现在，不少省份的人民公社已经办起了数以万计的土化肥厂、颗粒肥料厂和细菌肥料厂，现在应当根据资源的条件，采取定人、定设备、定质、定量等办法，把这些肥料工厂巩固起来。
    现在各地人民公社正在开始采取措施，发展多种经济，积肥造肥可以同发展多种经济配合起来。例如多种绿肥，用绿肥作饲料大量养猪，既能发展养猪业，又能增加肥料，一举两得。山东省寿张县今年用大种饲料作物、大量养猪来解决肥料问题，这个经验很好，应当加以推广。
    为了把积肥造肥工作切实做好，还需要对农民普遍宣传关于施肥的科学知识，使农民懂得各种肥料的主要用途。这样，他们在积肥造肥的时候，就能重视各种肥料的规格、质量；在施肥的时候，也能比较合理地使用各种肥料，充分发挥各种肥料的肥效。关于肥料方面的科学教育，可以作为农村红专学校的生产技术课程的一个部分，有计划地进行。
    要破肥料关，必须解放思想，抱着充分的信心来投入积肥造肥运动。因此，各地要深入进行政治思想工作，通过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，批判纠正各种各样的不正确看法和工作方法，使积肥造肥运动更深入更广泛地开展起来，为明年的更大丰收创造个十分可靠的条件。
