At the entrance of the venue, the gold-lettered Hall of Fame displayed the advanced model deeds of 296 family members of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students, including the famous agricultural labor model Li Qiubai, the "both civil and military" new-type farmer Xu Yukui, the hero on the steel front Liang Jiyao, the industrial labor model Chen Dingmao, the female militia member on the coastal defense front Shi Biyu, the meritorious person supporting the front line Li Quanshui, the technician Cheng Jinju, who is known as a good daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law and a good mother to her children, the famous athlete Huang Qianghui, the female writer Xiao Fei from a peasant background, the excellent Chao opera actress and advanced worker Li Yuchan, the doctor Boyan Batu who is engaged in technical innovation, and Zheng Shuxian, a three-good student and gold medal winner.

The red frames of the Hall of Fame also displayed good news and products from overseas Chinese farms, factories, and schools, including steel, chemical products, paper, and famous fruits such as pineapple and citrus, etc. These are the fruits of the labor of family members of overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students. During the Great Leap Forward across the country, they, along with the people of the whole country, contributed their wisdom and strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, delivered a written opening speech. Chen Jiageng congratulated the more than 290 advanced model figures among the returned overseas Chinese, family members of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students who attended the meeting. He called on all returned overseas Chinese and their families to support the people's communes with practical actions and work hard to run the communes well together with the people of the whole country.

He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, delivered a speech at the meeting, warmly congratulating the opening of the meeting. She pointed out that under the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, returned overseas Chinese generally showed soaring enthusiasm in various positions and made great achievements. Many people have made contributions in scientific and technological inventions and creations. Family members of overseas Chinese across the country participate in labor production, establish a new concept of the glory of labor, and move towards the direction of self-reliance, which can share the burden of family life with overseas relatives. Under the guidance of the policy of combining education with productive labor, returned overseas Chinese students practice diligence and frugality in their studies, and have made great progress in political thought, moral character, and scientific and technological knowledge. He Xiangning then talked about the national people's commune movement. She pointed out that returned overseas Chinese and their families realize that the establishment of people's communes will make their lives more secure and lay a happy foundation for their future generations, so they sincerely support and actively participate in the people's communes. Because the establishment of people's communes will promote greater development of my country's production and make the lives of family members of overseas Chinese more secure. He Xiangning hopes that returned overseas Chinese and their families will not only continue to support the people's communes economically, but also participate in production better and make greater contributions to consolidating and developing the people's communes.

He Xiangning said: "Now my country's various production and construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the lives of our people are becoming increasingly prosperous. However, compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are still suffering from the bullying of American imperialism. We miss the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and we must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. We hope that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan will prioritize national righteousness. As long as they still have patriotic ideas and national integrity, the door of the motherland is still open to them." He Xiangning then hoped that overseas Chinese would strengthen unity, further expand unity, and love the motherland more, in the spirit of loving the country as one family and not distinguishing between those who come first and those who come later, while strengthening friendly relations with the people of their residence.

Next, Lin Qiangyun, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, congratulated the conference on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and the people of Guangdong Province. Lin Qiangyun said that the family members of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese in Guangdong have greatly improved their ideological awareness through the national rectification campaign and socialist education. They enthusiastically participated in the people's commune movement, actively participated in construction, contributed ideas and skills, and supported the industrial and agricultural production and public welfare undertakings of the people's communes. He hopes that the family members of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese will exert greater strength and build their hometown in the greater leap forward of production next year.

Zhuang Xiquan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, delivered a report on the overview of the work of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese in 1958 at the meeting. The meeting will continue to be held.
