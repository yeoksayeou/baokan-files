Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a report on agricultural issues at the plenary session of the National Representative Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction on the afternoon of the 26th.

The report first pointed out that the National Representative Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction is a celebration meeting, a summing-up meeting, and also a rally to pledge determination. The task of the conference is to: celebrate victory, summarize experience, and encourage progress. At this meeting, review the great victory on the agricultural front in 1958, summarize the rich experience of the past year, propose new tasks for 1959, and prepare to struggle to achieve these new tasks.

I. The Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production in 1958

Liao Luyan said: The proportion of increased production of various agricultural crops in 1958 was unprecedented.

The total grain output in the country in 1958 reached about 750 billion jin, more than double the output of 1957. The annual growth rate was five times higher than the five-year growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period (a 20% increase from 1952 to 1957). The annual increase of about 380 billion jin was more than double the total increase during the five years of the First Five-Year Plan (180 billion jin). The total cotton output reached about 67 million dan, also more than double that of 1957. The annual growth rate was four times higher than the five-year growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan (a 25% increase from 1952 to 1957). The annual increase of 34 million dan was much more than the total increase in the past five years (with production decreases in three of those years). Based on the past oil extraction rate, the edible vegetable oil that is expected to be produced will increase by about 50% compared to 1957. Such a large increase has never been seen before.

Other industrial raw material crops: cured tobacco, sugarcane, and sugar beet have doubled in production. Hemp, silk, tea, and fruit increased by 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, which was also rare in the past.

Animal husbandry: The pregnancy rate of female large livestock reached 67% of eligible female livestock, the highest in recent years. The number of sheep increased by about one-third compared to 1957. The number of pigs increased by about two-fifths compared to 1957.

The main features of the agricultural leap forward in 1958 are: the increase in unit yield was large; output increased season by season, and the momentum grew stronger season by season, with early rice higher than wheat, and late rice and late autumn crops higher than early and mid-season rice; many low-yield areas and low-yield crops turned over, and low-yield became high-yield; the original high-yield crops and high-yield areas became even higher-yield. Of course, the magnitude of the leap forward in various regions and crops was still unbalanced. The great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 threw the pessimistic view of "agricultural production cannot develop rapidly" into the clouds; it relieved some people's worries about "large population and small arable land." The bourgeoisie's "population theory" went bankrupt, and the imperialist reactionaries' curses about our "inability to solve the population contradiction" were shattered by the facts of the great leap forward.

In the great leap forward in agricultural production, forestry and fishery production, as well as land reclamation, water conservancy construction, and meteorological work, also leaped forward together.

In forestry, the afforestation area in 1958 was about twice the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period; timber production also greatly exceeded previous years; there were also great achievements in regeneration of harvested areas and forest fire prevention; and the experiment to improve the methods of cultivating trees to promote rapid and high-yield timber production has been successful, which is a very meaningful mass creation.

In fisheries, the estimated amount completed in 1958 increased by about double compared to 1957.

In land reclamation, the achievements of the great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production also include the results of the hard work of state-owned farms and ranches. There have also been many new developments in the operation and management of state-owned farms and ranches, especially in the leap forward development in the reclamation of border areas and the planting of rubber.

In water conservancy, in 1958, more than 50 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work was completed in farmland water conservancy projects. The irrigated area expanded in one year was equal to more than one and a half times the expansion in the eight years from 1949 to 1957, and equal to twice the original irrigated area before liberation. The amount of soil and water conservation projects completed in 1958 controlled an area of soil and water loss that was more than four times greater than in 1957.

In meteorology, the focus of meteorological work serving agriculture was clarified, and the desolate situation of a few meteorological personnel doing meteorological work was changed, forming a booming situation of the masses doing meteorology. Meteorological stations, climate stations, climate outposts, and "weather watching groups" systematically formed a large army of meteorological work combining technicians and the masses, and the accuracy of weather forecasts also improved significantly.

The great leap forward in agricultural production has also promoted the development of various undertakings such as commune-run industries, rural commerce, transportation, postal and telecommunications, science, culture, education, and health.

This once again proves the superiority of the socialist system and proves that the subjective initiative and creativity of the working people who have been liberated economically, ideologically, and politically under the leadership of the Communist Party will exert infinite power.

The experiences of the agricultural great leap forward in 1958 are very rich. Concentrated, they can be mainly summarized into three points:

First, "Politics in command." The essence of "politics in command" is to strengthen the leadership of the Party. The great leap forward in 1958 was the great result of implementing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." The lessons of opposing rash advance in 1956 are still fresh in our minds. Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party can we implement "politics in command." Without the leadership of the Party, how can we talk about "politics in command"? Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party and carrying out socialist and communist ideological education extensively and deeply among cadres and the masses can we fight against various erroneous tendencies and correctly implement the Party's line and policies. This is also "politics in command." Advocating the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and liberating the mind is also an important experience of the great leap forward in 1958. However, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act involves the question of what to think, what to say, and what to do. It is necessary to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and scientific laws, not to think wildly, speak wildly, and act wildly away from the truth of Marxism-Leninism and scientific laws. Therefore, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act must also closely rely on the leadership of the Party and must also have "politics in command."

Second, the mass line. The mass line is our Party's glorious tradition. Whether on the industrial front, the agricultural front, or on all fronts of socialist construction, the fine tradition of the mass line is an important "magic weapon" for achieving the great leap forward in 1958. The great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters created in the rectification movement of the whole Party and the whole people, and widely applied in agricultural production and various rural work, are a new form of socialist democracy and a new creation of the mass line. The combination of cadres, the masses, and technical personnel, planting experimental fields, cadres participating in production, and leading production are also a new creation of the mass line in leading mass production and fighting against nature. The leadership method of "grasping both ends and leading the middle" is a concrete method of implementing the principle of coming from the masses and going to the masses. The new method of on-site meetings to promote experience is to directly bring everyone to the site of the new creations of the masses to "learn from the scriptures," summarize experience on the spot, observe and study on the spot, and promote it after returning, which has great and rapid results. This is also a new method of implementing the principle of coming from the masses and going to the masses. All this shows that in the great leap forward in 1958, the traditional style of the mass line has been well developed and has undergone new development; it is precisely this development that has guaranteed the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings of socialist construction in 1958.

Third, the "Eight-Character Charter." Water (water conservancy), fertilizer (fertilizer), soil (deep plowing and soil improvement), seed (good seeds), density (close planting), protection (plant protection, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests), tools (tool reform), and management (field management). These eight characters are the "Eight-Character Charter" proposed by Chairman Mao after summarizing the experience of the masses of farmers in increasing production. The practice in 1958 proved that wherever this "charter" was conscientiously implemented, the increase in agricultural production was relatively large; wherever this "charter" was implemented poorly, the increase rate was very small, or there was no increase, and individual counties, townships, and communes even reduced production. Of course, the specific practices of each character of the "Eight-Character Charter" should be adapted to local conditions, and different crops and different varieties should also have different practices, not uniformly. However, despite the different practices, generally speaking, this "Eight-Character Charter" must be conscientiously implemented. This is a fundamental experience in the technical measures to increase production in the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958.

We must apply these rich and successful experiences of 1958 to the work in 1959.

II. Strive for a Greater Harvest and Comprehensive Leap Forward in Agricultural Production in 1959

Next, Liao Luyan spoke about striving for a greater harvest and comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

He said: The achievements of the agricultural front in 1958 were unprecedentedly great, but agricultural production has not completely passed the test. There are still five hurdles to overcome: ① Grain should reach an average of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per person nationwide, and the total grain output should be doubled or tripled compared to 1958; the proportion of potatoes in grain should be gradually reduced; ② Cotton must achieve adequate clothing, with an average of 20-30 jin of ginned cotton per person nationwide, and the total cotton output must also be doubled or tripled compared to 1958; ③ The production of oil crops and hemp has not fundamentally passed the test; ④ Tea and silk have not yet recovered to their historical highest levels; ⑤ Animal husbandry production is still a weak link, with insufficient draught power and the supply of meat not meeting needs. Therefore, the task is still very arduous, and we must not be negligent or complacent because of the great leap forward in 1958.

Specific requirements for 1959: Grain should reach 1,050 billion jin, an increase of 300 billion jin compared to 1958; cotton should reach 100 million dan, an increase of 33 million dan compared to 1958; the production of oil crops and hemp must basically pass the test in 1959; tea, silk, and other industrial raw material crops should have greater development; animal husbandry: large livestock should strive for full pregnancy of eligible female livestock, and carry out the "Four Completions Movement"; pigs and sheep should have greater development. In addition to requiring a certain number of livestock, it is also necessary to ensure a certain slaughter rate, meat output, and market supply. Production of poultry, vegetables, and aquatic products and other non-staple foods should be properly arranged to ensure the supply of non-staple foods for urban and rural people. Ensuring the supply of non-staple foods for urban people is the glorious task of rural people's communes.

Ensure a bumper harvest in the first harvest season of 1959. Currently, we must focus on field management of winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed, winter production, water conservancy, manure accumulation, and preparatory work for spring plowing. After the beginning of spring, we must focus on early rice, and we must do a good job in preparing for early rice now.

In 1959, we must also focus on the movement of high-yield demonstration plots on a large scale, conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter," and garden-ize cultivation. Changing shallow plowing and extensive cultivation to deep plowing and intensive cultivation, and changing extensive planting and low yields to intensive planting and high yields, this policy is completely correct. The success of the high-yield demonstration plot movement on a large scale will lay a preliminary foundation for gradually reducing the existing cultivated land area to, for example, about one-third, and will gradually realize Chairman Mao's great ideal of turning the land into a garden.

In 1959, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should develop in an all-round way. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are interconnected and interdependent. A comprehensive revolution must be carried out in all five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries to completely change the face of the entire agricultural front.

The production policy of the people's commune should be: industry and agriculture should be developed simultaneously, and self-sufficient production and commodity production should be developed simultaneously. Vigorously developing commune-run industries will, on the one hand, accelerate national industrialization, and on the other hand, promote the realization of ownership by the whole people, accelerate commune industrialization, and narrow the gap between urban and rural areas. Developing commodity production is conducive to the development of socialist economic construction and is also an important measure to consolidate and develop the people's commune. State-owned farms should play an exemplary role in implementing the policy of all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production.

The planned growth rate of grain and cotton in 1959 is lower than the actual growth rate in 1958, but it is still a leap forward plan and is entirely possible to complete, and should strive to exceed. The reason for setting the indicators in this way is to free up some labor to expand the planting of oil crops, cotton, hemp, and various industrial raw material crops, develop diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, develop commune-run industries, and also free up some labor to support large industries. Grain, cotton, and various cash crops, agriculture, industry, and diversified operations of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should all have a certain proportion. This is also to avoid being too tense and to combine work and rest. At the same time, it is very beneficial to set the indicators lower and leave room for the masses to exceed them. The indicators in 1958 were exceeded time and time again. The production tasks in 1959 are complex and diverse, and rural labor must be well and rationally arranged.

With the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, the new situation of people's communization, more abundant experience, and stronger strength, the production tasks in 1959 can be completed and must be completed. We must do everything possible to strive for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. Our slogan is: Bumper harvest after bumper harvest, leap forward after leap forward.

III. Unify Understanding, Raise Ideology, Do a Good Job in Production, Do a Good Job in Life, and Run Rural People's Communes Better

The third issue Liao Luyan spoke about was unifying understanding, raising ideology, doing a good job in production, doing a good job in life, and running rural people's communes better. On this issue, he elaborated on the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.

He pointed out that the people's commune is still basically a collective ownership system, but it already has some elements of ownership by the whole people; after the realization of ownership by the whole people, the people's commune will still be socialist in nature; the task of our people at the present stage is to build socialism, and the people's commune will greatly strengthen the speed of socialist construction in our country and will become the best form for our country to realize two transitions (from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, from socialism to communism); the people's commune must continue to develop commodity production and continue to maintain the principle of distribution according to work.

In addition, he also pointed out that the people's commune should, based on deep plowing and intensive cultivation, intensive planting and high yields, and garden-izing cultivation, gradually reduce the existing cultivated land area to, for example, about one-third, and gradually realize the great ideal of turning the land into a garden; a comprehensive revolution in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries; and completely change the face of the entire agricultural front; industry and agriculture should be developed simultaneously, and self-sufficient production and commodity production should be developed simultaneously to do a good job in production. The people's commune is also the organizer of people's lives, and while doing a good job in production, it must do a good job in life. It is not enough to only focus on production without focusing on life, and the result will be that production will not be done well. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we must care about the lives of the masses. The more we care about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. To do a good job in life, the current main tasks are: ensuring sleep and rest time, running canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. Let the commune members eat well, sleep well, and take good care of their children, and the commune members will be in a good mood and more enthusiastic, ensuring a greater leap forward in production. He also called for doing a good job in the operation and management of the people's commune. Rectify the organization, improve the system, and manage at different levels and with different powers. Combine militarization of organization, combatization of action, and collectivization of life with democratization of management. Strengthen planning and statistical work, strengthen economic accounting, and economic work must be done more and more meticulously.

Finally, Minister Liao Luyan pointed out that to run the people's commune well, we must strengthen the Party's leadership over the people's commune, strengthen ideological education, implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and also pay special attention to carrying forward the style of the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts. Thereby ensuring a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

    廖鲁言关于农业问题的报告
    新华社26日讯  农业部部长、中共中央农村工作部副部长廖鲁言，26日下午在全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的全体大会上，作了关于农业问题的报告。
    报告首先指出：全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议是一个庆功会、总结会、也是一个誓师大会。会议的任务就是：庆祝胜利、总结经验、鼓舞前进。在这个会上，检阅1958年农业战线上的伟大胜利，总结一年来丰富的经验，提出1959年的新任务，并且做好准备为实现新任务而奋斗。
    一、1958年农业生产大跃进
    廖鲁言说：1958年各种农作物增产的比例是空前的。
    1958年全国粮食的总产量达七千五百亿斤左右，比1957年的产量增加一倍还多一点，一年增长的比例比第一个五年计划期间五年增长的比例（1957年比1952年增长20％）还多五倍；一年增加三千八百亿斤左右，比第一个五年计划期间五年增加数的总和（一千八百亿斤）还多一倍以上；棉花的总产量达六千七百万担左右，也比1957年增加一倍还多一点，一年增长的比例比第一个五年计划五年增长的比例（1957年比1952年增长25％）还多四倍；一年增加三千四百万担，比上五年增加数的总和还多得多（上五年中有三年是减产的）；油料，按照往年的供榨率和出油率计算，预计可生产的食用植物油比1957年增长50％左右，这样大的增长幅度是过去没有的。
    其他工业原料作物：烤烟、甘蔗和甜菜是成倍增长的，麻类、蚕丝、茶叶和水果增长的幅度分别为20％、30％、40％不等，这种高幅度过去也是少见的。
    畜牧业：大家畜的母畜满怀率达适龄母畜的67％，这是近几年来最高的一年；羊比1957年增长约三分之一；猪比1957年增加五分之二左右。
    1958年农业跃进的形势主要是：单位产量增长的幅度大；产量一季比一季高，劲头一季比一季大，早稻比麦子高，晚稻和晚秋又比早中稻高；许多低产区和低产作物翻了身，低产变成了高产；原来的高产作物和高产的地区更高产了。当然，各地区和各作物的跃进的幅度还是不平衡的。1958年的农业大跃进，把“农业生产不能快速发展”的悲观论抛到了九霄云外；解除了某些人关于“人口多耕地少”的忧愁。资产阶级的“人口论”破产了，帝国主义反动派关于我们“不能解决人口矛盾”的诅咒，在大跃进的事实面前被粉碎了。
    在农业生产大跃进中，林业、渔业生产和农垦、水利建设、气象事业也是一齐跃进的。
    林业方面，1958年造林面积相当于第一个五年计划期间五年造林面积总和的两倍左右；木材生产量也大大超过往年；迹地更新和护林防火也有很大的成就；改进林木的培育方法，以促进木材快速丰产的试验已经成功，这是很有意义的一种群众创造。
    水产方面，预计1958年完成的数量，比1957年增加一倍左右。
    农垦方面，农、牧业生产大跃进的成就，也包括国营农、牧场努力的成果，国营农、牧场的经营管理也有很多新的发展，特别是在边疆地区的垦殖和橡胶的种植方面有了跃进的发展。
    水利方面，1958年农田水利工程完成了五百多亿土石方，一年扩大的灌溉面积等于1949—1957年八年扩大数的一倍半以上，等于解放前原有的灌溉面积的两倍；1958年度完成的水土保持工程量，可以控制水土流失的面积比1957年增加了四倍多。
    气象方面，明确了气象工作以农业为服务的重点，改变了少数气象人员办气象的冷冷清清的局面，形成了群众办气象的轰轰烈烈的局
  面；气象台、气候站、气候哨、“看天组”，系统地形成了技术人员和群众相结合的一支气象工作的大军，气象预报的准确率也有了显著的提高。
    农业生产大跃进，也促进了社办工业、农村商业、交通、邮电、科学文化教育卫生等各项事业的发展。
    这再一次证明社会主义制度的优越性，证明在经济上、思想上、政治上解放了的劳动人民，在共产党的领导下，他们的主观能动性和创造性将发挥出无穷的力量。
    1958年农业大跃进的经验是非常丰富的，集中起来，可以主要归纳为三条：
    第一、“政治挂帅”。“政治挂帅”实质就是加强党的领导。1958年的大跃进，就是贯彻执行党中央和毛主席的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”这条总路线的伟大成果。1956年反冒进的教训在我们的头脑中还是记忆犹新的。只有加强党的领导，才能实行“政治挂帅”。离开了党的领导，还谈得上什么“政治挂帅”？！只有加强党的领导，在干部和群众中广泛深入地进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，才能同各种错误的倾向展开斗争，也才能正确执行党的路线和政策。这也就是“政治挂帅”。提倡敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，解放思想，这也是1958年大跃进的一条重要经验。而敢想、敢说、敢做，就有一个想什么、说什么、做什么的问题，是要根据马列主义的普遍真理、根据科学的法则去敢想、敢说、敢做，而不是离开马列主义的真理和科学法则去乱想、乱说、乱做。所以，敢想、敢说、敢做也必须紧密依靠党的领导，也要“政治挂帅”。
    第二、群众路线。群众路线是我们党的光荣传统。无论在工业战线上、农业战线上和社会主义建设事业的各个战线上，群众路线这个传统的优良作风，是取得1958年大跃进的重要的“法宝”。在全党全民整风运动中创造出来的，在农业生产和农村各项工作中普遍应用的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报，做什么，鸣放什么，辩论什么，这是社会主义民主的一种新形势，也是群众路线的一种新创造。干部、群众和技术人员三结合，种试验田，干部参加生产，领导生产，这也是在领导群众生产、向自然界做斗争方面，群众路线的一种新创造。“抓两头、带中间”的领导方法，也就是实行从群众中来、到群众中去的一种具体方法。现场会议这种推广经验的新方式，则是把大家直接带到群众新创造的现场去“取经”，就地总结经验，实地观摩学习，回去推广，收效大而且快，这也是实行从群众中来、到群众中去的一种新方法。这一切说明，在1958年大跃进中，群众路线的传统作风有了很好的发扬和新的发展；也正是这种发扬和发展，保证了1958年工业农业生产和社会主义建设各项事业的大跃进。
    第三、“八字宪法”。水（水利）、肥（肥料）、土（深翻地、改良土壤）、种（良种）、密（密植）、保（植物保护，防治病虫害）、工（工具改革）、管（田间管理），这八个字，是毛主席总结了农民群众增产措施的经验而提出的“八字宪法”。1958年的实践证明，哪里认真贯彻执行了这个“宪法”，哪里的农业生产的增长幅度就比较大；哪里贯彻执行这个“宪法”比较差，哪里的增产比例就很小，或者没有增产，个别的县、乡和公社甚至减了产。当然，“八字宪法”的每一个字的具体做法，应该因地制宜，不同的作物和不同的品种也应该有不同的做法，不是千篇一律的。但是，做法尽管不同，总的来说，必须认真执行这个“八字宪法”。这是1958年农业生产大跃进在增产技术措施方面的一条根本经验。
    我们必须把1958年的这些丰富的成功的经验运用到1959年的工作中去。
    二、争取1959年农业生产
    更大的丰收和全面的跃进
    接着，廖鲁言讲了关于争取1959年农业生产更大丰收和全面跃进的问题。
    他说：1958年农业战线的成就是空前巨大的，但是农业生产并没有完全过关。还要过五关：①粮食要达到全国平均每人两千斤到三千斤，粮食总产量还要比1958年再增产一倍到两倍；薯类在粮食中所占的比重要逐步减低；②棉花要实现丰衣，全国平均每人有皮棉二十—三十斤，棉花总产量也要比1958年再增产一倍到两倍；③油料和麻类的生产还根本没有过关；④茶叶、蚕丝还没有恢复到历史最高水平；⑤畜牧业生产还是一个薄弱环节，畜力不足，肉食供应不能满足需要。因此，任务还是很艰巨的，绝不能因为1958年的大跃进而疏忽松劲，骄傲自满。
    1959年的具体要求：粮食达到一万零五百亿斤，比1958年增加三千亿斤；棉花达到一万万担，比1958年增加三千三百万担；油料和麻类的生产必须在1959年基本过关；茶叶、蚕丝和其他工业原料作物都要有更大的发展；畜牧业：大家畜要力争适龄母畜的满怀，开展“四全运动”；猪羊都要有较大的发展，除了要求达到一定的存栏数以外，并且要保证一定的屠宰率、出肉量和上市量；鸡鸭、蔬菜和水产等副食品的生产都要有适当的安排，保证城乡人民副食品的供应。保证城市人民副食品的供应，是农村人民公社的光荣任务。
    保证1959年第一个收获季节的大丰收。当前要抓小麦、油菜等越冬作物的田间管理、冬季生产、水利、积肥和备耕工作。开春以后要抓早稻，现在就要做好早稻的备耕工作。
    1959年还要抓大面积高额丰产田运动，切实执行“八字宪法”，耕作园田化；改变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收，这个方针是完全正确的；大面积高额丰产田运动的成功，就为把现有种农作物的耕地面积逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右奠定了初步基础，就将逐步实现毛主席的大地园林化的伟大理想。
    1959年农林牧副渔要全面发展。农、林、牧是相互结合，相互依存的。一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。
    人民公社的生产方针应当是：工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。大搞社办工业，一方面将加速国家工业化，另方面将促进全民所有制的实现，加速公社工业化，缩小城市和乡村的差别。发展商品生产，有利于社会主义经济建设的发展，也是巩固和发展人民公社的一项重要措施。在执行农林牧副渔全面发展、工业农业并举和自给性生产商品性生产并举的方针上，国营农场应该起模范作用。
    1959年粮棉计划增长的比例定得比1958年的实际增长的比例低，但是还是一个跃进的计划，是完全有可能完成的，并且应该力争超过。指标这样定的原因，就是为了腾出一定的劳力来扩大油料、棉、麻和各种工业原料作物的种植，发展林牧副渔等多种经营，发展社办工业，也腾出一定的劳力来支援大工业。粮棉和各种经济作物，农业、工业和林牧副渔多种经营都应该有一定的比例。这也是为了避免过于紧张，并且使劳动和休息结合起来。同时，指标定得低一点，留有余地，让群众去超过，很有好处。1958年的指标就是一次一次被超过的。1959年的生产任务是复杂多样的，农村劳动力必须有很好的合理安排。
    有了1958年农业生产的大跃进，有了人民公社化的新形势，经验更丰富了，力量更雄厚了，1959年的生产任务是能够完成的，也必须完成。一定要千方百计地争取1959年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进。我们的口号是：丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进。
    三、统一认识，提高思想，搞好生产，
    搞好生活，把农村人民公社办得更好
    廖鲁言讲的第三个问题，是关于统一认识，提高思想，搞好生产，搞好生活，把农村人民公社办得更好的问题。在这个问题上，他根据八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的文件作了阐述。
    他指出，人民公社现在基本上还是集体所有制，但是已经带着全民所有制的若干成分；在实现了全民所有制以后，人民公社也还是社会主义性质的；我国人民现阶段的任务是建设社会主义，人民公社将大大加强我国社会主义建设的速度，并且将成为我国实现两个过渡（由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制、由社会主义过渡到共产主义）的最好的形式；人民公社必须继续发展商品生产和继续保持按劳分配的原则。
    此外，他还指出：人民公社应该根据深耕细作、少种多收、耕作园田化，把现有种农作物的耕地面积逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右，逐步实现大地园林化的伟大理想；农林牧副渔五业全线大革命；彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌；工业和农业同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举来搞好生产。人民公社也是人民生活的组织者，在搞好生产的同时，必须搞好生活。只抓生产，不抓生活，是不行的，其结果是生产也搞不好。群众的干劲越大，越要关心群众的生活，越关心群众的生活，群众的干劲也会越大。搞好生活，目前主要是：保证睡眠和休息的时间，办好食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等等。让社员吃好饭、睡好觉、带好孩子，社员就会心情舒畅、干劲更大，保证生产更大的跃进。他还要求搞好人民公社的经营管理。整顿组织，健全制度，分级分权管理。使组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化同管理民主化结合起来。加强计划工作和统计工作，加强经济核算，经济工作必须越做越细致。
    最后，廖鲁言部长指出：办好人民公社，必须加强党对人民公社的领导，加强思想教育，贯彻执行党的路线、方针和政策，还要特别注意发扬群众路线的作风和实事求是的作风。从而保证1959年农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进。
