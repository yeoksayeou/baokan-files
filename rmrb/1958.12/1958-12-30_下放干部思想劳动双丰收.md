    Cadres Sent Down Reap Double Harvest of Ideology and Labor
    People's Daily Commentator

    Last winter and this spring, approximately one million cadres responded to the Party's call and went to the countryside and mountainous areas to participate in labor training. Now, a large number of comrades have completed their training and returned to their original offices, or have taken on new jobs according to the needs of the state. Some comrades are still continuing their labor training. The facts of the past year or so have proven that sending cadres down to participate in labor training is indeed one of the effective ways to build a cadre team that strives for the cause of communism and can withstand risks. The vast majority of the cadres sent down have reaped a double harvest in ideology and labor after a year or so of training.

  The vast majority of the cadres sent down were intellectuals who had not participated in labor production in the past. They used to look down on labor and lacked class feelings for the working people. During the period they were sent down, these comrades underwent arduous and strict training during the period of peaceful construction in these areas. It can be said that more than 90% of the people performed very well in this training. They and the broad masses of farmers, with great enthusiasm, strived to double the output of steel and grain. Regardless of the severe cold or hot weather, regardless of wind or rain, everyone was never afraid of getting dirty or tired, taking the lead in enduring hardship and resting last, and truly played a leading role among the masses. After a long period of common labor and common life, they gradually established a friendship with the farmers like flesh and blood, and learned many excellent qualities from the farmers. After the cadres sent down changed their views on labor and the masses, the masses loved and trusted the cadres sent down. The moving scenes of reluctance between the masses and the cadres sent down when the cadres left in many places are the best illustration of this close relationship.

    Changing the view of labor and working people, and establishing feelings with the farmers, are the fundamental reasons for a series of profound changes in the cadres sent down. As early as 1939, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "If intellectuals do not combine with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and practice combining with the workers and peasants. Their final dividing line is only on this point." The situation in the past year has once again proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion. Many of these comrades sent down were active and hardworking in the past, and were generally loyal to the cause of socialism, but because they had never or had not been trained in the countryside and in labor production for a long time, there were still many problems in their ideology. In addition, some people originally came from families of the exploiting classes. Before being sent down, they had varying degrees of views that belittled labor and working people. Therefore, they often had some incorrect ideas and practices on certain issues, could not correctly implement the Party's policies, could not serve the people wholeheartedly, and the decadent bourgeois individualism was still very strong in some cadres. In the past year, the cadres sent down have undergone great changes in their combination with the masses and in their labor training. Many problems that could not be solved quickly in office life or in theoretical study have been solved to varying degrees. During the training period, the level of awareness of most comrades has been greatly improved. When they threw themselves into the vast collective and labored with the masses, their thinking changed, and they began to realize the insignificance of individual strength and the greatness of collective strength. In the past, those who were comfortable and greedy for enjoyment, afraid of difficulties, and pursued fame and fortune also began to feel ashamed of this idea. When many comrades devoted themselves to the red-hot mass movement, the brilliant prospects of the collective cause attracted them, making the various germs and dirt that measured personal gains and losses stored in their minds gradually decrease or disappear; the spirit of the masses who were not afraid of difficulties and did not talk about conditions encouraged them, making them grow a spiritual force that dared to despise difficulties and not be afraid of hardships. The socialist consciousness of the peasant masses in the communization movement moved them. When they had feelings for the collective, and even completely melted into the collective, all considerations for the individual naturally took a secondary position, making the individual subordinate to the collective. In the tense hard work, when the training was over and the work was redistributed, many comrades prominently showed this new style. More than 800 cadres sent down by the First Ministry of Machine Building in Xinxiang Prefecture, after the training, hundreds of people were assigned to work in remote areas and inland provinces with more difficult living conditions. They obeyed the state's allocation without hesitation and happily embarked on new jobs. They were determined to use their hands to open up roads and create happiness for later generations. What a heroic and noble communist style! This proves that as long as a person can truly combine with workers, peasants and soldiers, and train himself in collective labor, he can gradually establish a revolutionary outlook on life that serves the people wholeheartedly, and he can become the kind of noble person, pure person, moral person, who is free from vulgar interests, and is beneficial to the people, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in commemorating Bethune.

    After having feelings for the masses, many people began to understand that considering issues should have a mass viewpoint. With a mass viewpoint, these comrades had a further understanding of the correctness of the Party's policies and lines. This change is not surprising. The same thing, considering from an individualistic standpoint and considering from a mass viewpoint, will naturally lead to different conclusions. Some cadres sent down from cultural departments originally had doubts and resistance to the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and to the policy of seeking improvement on the basis of popularization. However, when they had feelings for the peasants, personally participated in the popularization of culture, and saw poetry materials and painting topics, poets, and painters everywhere, and saw the huge material force generated by literature and art serving the masses, they realized that cultural work also needs "small, local, and mass", and were sincerely willing to participate in these jobs.

    Most of the cadres sent down have learned one or more skills of physical labor. They have not only contributed to the great leap forward in the countryside and promoted their ideological transformation, but also initially changed the abnormal development of cadres only using their brains and not their hands, making everyone gradually become all-rounders in building socialism. This is an important step in eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

    The harvest of labor training is huge and multifaceted. We hope that the comrades who have returned to their original offices or have gone to new jobs can consolidate the results of labor training, improve their work style, and be more enthusiastic in fulfilling any tasks assigned to them by the Party selflessly. We hope that the comrades who are being assigned jobs can carry forward the communist style of not being afraid of hardship and not talking about conditions that they have developed in labor training, and unconditionally obey the assignment. We hope that the comrades who remain in the same place to continue training will develop a higher level of consciousness and strive to achieve greater harvests in ideology and labor. Whether it is comrades who have completed their training or continue to train, they need to pay attention to guarding against arrogance and impatience, and continue to transform and improve themselves diligently, and not have the slightest complacency and slackness. We must always remember that to become a well-rounded, truly risk-resisting working-class intellectual, more training and testing are needed.

    Labor training is one of the best ways to transform cadres. In the future, all departments and units should continue to organize cadres to go deep into factories and rural areas and participate in labor production in various ways suitable for the working conditions of their own agencies, so that more people can get the opportunity to train.

    下放干部思想劳动双丰收
    本报评论员
    去冬今春，一百万左右干部响应党的号召，下乡上山进行劳动锻炼。现在一大部分同志已经结束了锻炼，回到原机关工作，或者根据国家需要，走上新的工作岗位。一部分同志仍然继续进行劳动锻炼。一年左右的事实证明，下放干部进行劳动锻炼，的确是建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的、经得起风险的干部队伍的有成效的办法之一。绝大多数的下放干部，经历了一年左右的锻炼后，在思想上和劳动上都获得了丰收。
  绝大多数下放干部都是过去没有参加过劳动生产的知识分子。他们过去轻视劳动，对劳动人民缺乏阶级的感情。下放期间，这些同志在这些方面经受了和平建设时期的艰苦的严格的锻炼。可以说，90％以上的人在这次锻炼中都表现得很好。他们和广大农民群众一起，鼓足干劲，力争钢铁粮食产量加番。不论严寒酷暑，不论风里雨里，大家总是不嫌脏不嫌累，吃苦在前休息在后，在群众中真正起了带头作用。经过较长时期的共同劳动和共同生活，他们逐渐和农民群众建立起情同骨肉的友谊，从农民身上学到了许多优良品质。当下放干部对劳动对群众的看法有了改变以后，群众也就热爱下放干部，信任下放干部。许多地方在下放干部离开的时候，群众和下放干部之间难舍难离的动人情景就是这种亲密的关系的最好说明。
    改变了对劳动和劳动人民的看法，和农民群众建立了感情，这是下放干部发生一系列深刻变化的根本原因。毛泽东同志早在1939年就曾经指出：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点”。这一年来的情况又一次证明毛泽东同志论断的正确。这些下放同志中的很多人，过去工作是积极努力的，对社会主义事业一般也是忠诚的，但是由于从来没有或者长期没有在农村中和劳动生产中受到锻炼，思想意识中还存在不少毛病。另外一些人则原来出身于剥削阶级的家庭，在下放前，不同程度地存在着轻视劳动和劳动人民的观点，因此，他们对于某些问题，常常存在着一些不正确的想法和做法，不能正确地贯彻执行党的方针政策，不能全心全意为人民服务，腐朽的资产阶级个人主义思想在有些干部身上还非常浓厚。一年来，下放干部在和群众结合这一点上在下放劳动锻炼以后得到很大的改变，许多在机关生活中、在理论学习中不能很快地得到解决的问题，都得到程度不同的解决。锻炼期间，大多数同志的觉悟程度大大地提高了。他们投入浩大的集体和群众一起劳动的时候，他们的想法就变了，开始体会到个人力量的渺小，集体力量的伟大。过去，好安逸、贪享受，害怕困难、追逐名利的人，也开始感到这种想法的可耻。当许多同志投身在火热的群众运动之中的时候，集体事业的光辉前景就吸引着他们，使他们思想里贮藏的那些计较个人得失利害的种种霉菌和污垢逐渐减少或消失；群众的不怕困难、不讲条件的干劲鼓舞着他们，使他们生长起一种敢于藐视困难不怕艰苦的精神力量。农民群众在公社化运动中的社会主义觉悟感动着他们。当他们对集体有了感情，甚至和集体完全溶而为一的时候，对个人的一切考虑，就自然退居于次要的地位，使个人服从于集体。在紧张的苦战中，在下放锻炼结束重新分配工作的时候，许多同志都突出地表现出这种新风格。第一机械工业部下放在新乡专区的八百多名干部，在锻炼结束后，有几百人被分配在边远地区和内地生活比较艰苦的省份去工作，他们毫不犹豫地服从了国家的分配，愉快地走上新的工作岗位，他们立志用自己的双手为后来者开拓道路创造幸福。这是多么豪迈多么高尚的共产主义风格！这证明，任何一个人只要能够真正和工农兵结合，在集体的劳动中锻炼自己，就能逐步树立起全心全意为人民服务的革命人生观，就有可能成为像毛泽东同志在纪念白求恩的时候所说的，那种毫无自私自利之心的高尚的人、纯粹的人、有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
    和群众有了感情之后，不少人开始懂得考虑问题应该有群众观点。有了群众观点，这些同志对党的方针路线的正确性就有了进一步的体会。这种变化并不奇怪，同是一件事情，站在个人主义立场考虑和用群众观点考虑，自然会得出不同的结论。有些文化部门的下放干部，原来对文艺的工农兵方向，对于在普及的基础上求提高的方针是有怀疑和抵触的。但是，当他们对农民有了感情，亲自参与了文化的普及工作，看到到处是诗材画题、诗人、画家，看到了文艺为群众服务所产生的巨大物质力量以后，就体会到文化工作也需要“小、土、群”，并且真心愿意参加这些工作。
    下放干部大都学会了一种或几种体力劳动的技能，他们不但对农村的大跃进有了贡献，促进了他们的思想改造，还初步改变了干部只用脑不用手的畸形发展状态，使大家逐渐成为建设社会主义的多面手。这是消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别的一个重要步骤。
    劳动锻炼的收获是巨大的多方面的。我们希望回到原机关或到新岗位工作的同志们，能够巩固劳动锻炼的成果，改进工作作风，鼓起更大的干劲，忘我地完成党所交付给自己的任何任务。我们希望正在分配工作的同志，能够发扬在劳动锻炼中养成的不怕艰苦不讲条件的共产主义风格，无条件地服从分配。我们希望留在原地继续锻炼的同志，发扬更高的自觉性，争取在思想和劳动上得到更大的丰收。不论是已经结束锻炼或继续锻炼的同志，都需要注意戒骄戒躁，继续刻苦的改造和提高自己，而不要有丝毫的自满和松懈。要时刻记住，要成为红透专深、真正经得起风险的工人阶级知识分子，还需要更多的锻炼和考验。
    劳动锻炼是改造干部的最好的办法之一，今后，各部门、各单位还应当以各种适合本机关工作条件的方式，继续组织干部深入工厂、农村，参加劳动生产，使更多的人得到锻炼的机会。
