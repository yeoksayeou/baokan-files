　　Both "Cold" and "Hot"
　　Wu Chuanqi
　　Hot is overflowing revolutionary enthusiasm
　　Cold is the spirit of scientific analysis
　　The so-called both "cold" and "hot" requires people to be good at implementing the dialectical materialist standpoint, viewpoint, and method into practical work. "Hot" means having overflowing revolutionary enthusiasm, soaring revolutionary drive, and fully developing the subjective initiative of people; "cold" means maintaining a clear head, the spirit of scientific analysis, and the attitude of constantly understanding and grasping objective laws. "Hot" and "cold" are a unity of opposites. Combining both cold and hot is necessary to correctly observe and handle problems.
　　In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the output of major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, grain, cotton, machinery, and coal doubled compared to 1957. Practice has proven that China's socialist construction can develop at a high speed not only in industry but also in agriculture. However, some people in the past only one-sidedly emphasized the limitations of material and technical conditions. Bound by various conventions, they dared not think or act, willing only to follow the rules and surrender to difficulties, resulting in "less, slower, worse, and more expensive." These people loved cold and not hot. This kind of cold is not the calmness of scientific analysis. On the other hand, the great victory of the Great Leap Forward also made some people dizzy, and they became indifferent to everything, as if there were only people's subjective wishes and no objective laws. As long as they could think of it, they could do it. They only started from subjective wishes and not from practical possibilities. These people went to another extreme, loving only hot and not cold.
　　Chairman Mao has always taught us to despise difficulties strategically and to value difficulties tactically. The so-called "despise" and "value" are also a unity of opposites. The more we despise difficulties strategically, the more we must value difficulties tactically. However, those who are "cold," that is, those who lack revolutionary spirit, dare not despise difficulties strategically and are often frightened by difficulties, surrendering to them. Conversely, those who are too hot-headed do not know that they must also value difficulties tactically, and as a result, they often suffer great losses.
　　Have a viewpoint of continuous revolution
　　Also have a viewpoint of revolutionary stages
　　Striving to realize a communist society is the ultimate goal of Marxists. However, some people once held a mysterious view of communism, regarding it as an infinitely distant cause; or they were satisfied with existing achievements, lost their revolutionary spirit of progress, and lost their sensitivity to new things. They did not take a positive attitude towards the sprouts of communism in socialist society, and in socialist construction, they did not actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism, but instead adopted a passive attitude or even adopted an attitude of obstructing and suppressing; they believed that "the revolution has reached its peak" and stopped there. These people also love cold and not hot. However, "sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat." If a person is only cold and not hot, they will degenerate over time.
　　On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the whole country quickly realized the people's commune system, and rural people's communes began to implement a distribution system that combined wages and the supply system. This was an urgent demand of the broad masses and also a creation in the socialist distribution method—it began to have the sprouts of communism, which was not only conducive to accelerating socialist construction but also conducive to preparing conditions for the future transition to communism. It is, of course, wrong to turn a blind eye to, be indifferent to, or even belittle such great beginnings. This is the attitude of those who are too cold. However, for such a great beginning, some people's heads are a little too hot. Some people advocated that rural people's communes "immediately implement ownership by the whole people" or even "immediately enter communism." This, in addition to vulgarizing the great ideal of communism and creating ideological confusion among the masses, would not produce any positive significance. They have good intentions, but they are too impatient, with enthusiasm exceeding calmness.
　　Loving cold and not hot or loving hot and not cold
　　Means loving metaphysics and not dialectics
　　A person who is only cold and not hot, or only hot and not cold, is metaphysical and definitely not dialectical. Being only cold and not hot will lead to chronic diseases and violate the Marxist-Leninist "theory of continuous revolution," stopping at a certain stage of revolutionary development. Conversely, if one is only hot and not cold, one will get an acute disease and violate the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolutionary development stages, falling into the illusion of attempting to transcend the current stage of the revolution and jump into the next stage.
　　If a person "sees things but not people," and does not see the power of the masses, he will be cold and not hot; conversely, if he "sees people but not things," that is, he only sees the subjective initiative of people and does not see objective material conditions, he will also be hot and not cold. Not long ago, the argument that agricultural production could only increase by a few percent each year was prevalent. This was because they "saw things but not people," failing to see the great subjective initiative and creative power of the people, and failing to see the realistic possibilities in the development of things. Of course, they could not take a positive attitude, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and take practical steps to turn this realistic possibility into reality. This view has now been mercilessly criticized by practical experience. However, some people do things without considering the actual conditions at all. In one place, an experimental wheat field of one hectare put forward a high-yield target of 1.5 million kilograms per acre. As an experiment, it is necessary to affirm that their desire is good with great enthusiasm and high motivation. However, they lack a reliable basis and do not have concrete calculations, which is a manifestation of only hot and not cold heads. Taking the non-realistic possibility as the realistic possibility will inevitably fall into subjective idealism. Some comrades still do not understand that there are two kinds of possibilities, non-realistic and realistic. Realistic possibility refers to the possibility that both subjective and objective conditions are met, and non-realistic possibility refers to the possibility that neither subjective nor objective conditions are met. We oppose the conservative thinking that cannot see the realistic possibilities in the development of things, oppose "seeing things but not people," and also oppose the non-realistic fantasy that ignores objective conditions, oppose "seeing people but not things." We advocate seeing both people and things, both hot and cold.
　　Since saying that the head should be cold refers to scientific analysis, can it be said that those who love cold and not hot have any basis for scientific analysis? Of course not. As mentioned above, cold and hot are a unity of opposites, just as objective and subjective are a unity of opposites. Only talking about the objective and not the subjective is not dialectics in itself. Similarly, only wanting cold and not hot violates science itself, and is a manifestation of right-leaning conservatism and metaphysical mechanism. Therefore, when we remind those who are too hot-headed to cool down a bit, those with right-leaning conservative ideas, those "wave-watching factions," and those "autumn account settlers," should not take the opportunity to muddy the waters. Doing so is in vain. Practice is the objective criterion for testing truth. The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 all prove that their minds are unscientific.
　　If the thinking method is wrong
　　It will also cause cold and hot imbalances
　　Errors in thinking methods can also cause people to have cold and hot diseases. Standpoint and method are related but also different. From the point of view of thinking methods, whether loving cold and not hot or loving hot and not cold is loving metaphysics and not dialectics. Some people, when they see certain shortcomings in their work, become half cold, or only see shortcomings and deny achievements, exaggerating individual shortcomings as comprehensive, mistaking one finger for ten fingers, or being passive, complaining, pessimistic, and disappointed, thereby only hindering and not promoting in their work. In addition, some people are prone to get a hot head when they have made some achievements in their work: either they only see achievements and do not admit shortcomings, and do not understand that even with great achievements, small shortcomings cannot be ignored; or they are arrogant and complacent and no longer make progress. Both tendencies, although often different in degree, are manifestations of not loving dialectics and preferring metaphysics.
　　When the masses are not mobilized, be a little hotter
　　When the masses have been mobilized, be a little colder
　　The dialectical materialist worldview requires people to be both hot and cold; to be hot, so we advocate liberating the mind, daring to think and act, and going all out to strive for progress. To be cold, so we advocate that people fully understand objective reality and strive to make their thinking and understanding conform to the laws of development of objective things. Breaking superstition is not breaking science, and daring to think and act is not blindly thinking and blindly acting.
　　For leaders, being both hot and cold has special significance. When a mass movement is to be launched, and when the mass movement has not yet been launched, it is necessary to be a little hotter on the premise of correctly grasping the party's policies. Conversely, when a vigorous mass movement has already risen, the mind should be a little colder. Such a combination of cold and hot can ensure the full mobilization of the masses and the healthy development of the movement. Of course, throughout the entire process of the mass movement, in any work, and at any time, it is necessary to be both hot and cold, to have fervent revolutionary enthusiasm, and to have a calm and scientific mind.
　　In short, the combination of hot and cold, the combination of soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, the combination of daring to think and act and seeking truth from facts, the combination of giving play to subjective initiative and proceeding from reality, and so on, are the correct thinking methods and working styles required by dialectical materialism.

### 亦“冷”亦“热”

    亦“冷”亦“热”
    吴传启
      热是充沛的革命热情
      冷是科学分析的精神
    所谓亦“冷”亦“热”，这就是要求人们善于把辩证唯物主义的立场、观点和方法贯彻到实际工作中去。热就是要有充沛的革命热情，冲天的革命干劲，充分地发挥人的主观能动作用；冷就是要保持清醒的头脑，科学分析的精神，不断认识和掌握客观规律的态度。“热”和“冷”是对立面的统一，亦冷亦热，相互结合，才能正确地观察和处理问题。
    1958年的大跃进，钢、粮、棉、机械、煤等主要工农业产品的产量，比1957年翻了一番。实践证明，我国的社会主义建设，不仅在工业方面，而且在农业方面，都可以高速度地发展。但是有一些人，过去却只片面地强调物质和技术条件的限制。他们受种种陈规所束缚，不敢想、不敢干，只愿按部就班，向困难低头，结果是“少慢差费”。这种人是爱冷不爱热的。这样的冷就不是科学分析的冷静了。另一方面，大跃进的伟大胜利，也使某些人冲昏了头脑，他们变得一切都不在乎，仿佛只有人们的主观愿望，并没有什么客观规律，只要想得到，就能做得到。只从主观愿望出发，不从实际可能出发。这种人又走了另一极端，只爱热不爱冷了。
    毛主席一向教导我们，在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难。所谓“藐视”与“重视”，也是统一的对立面。愈是在战略上藐视困难，就愈要在战术上重视困难。但是那些“冷”的也就是缺乏革命气概的人，就不敢在战略上藐视困难，而往往会被困难吓倒，向困难低头。反之，头脑太热的人，不知道在战术上还要重视困难，结果往往吃了大亏。
    要有不断革命论的观点
    也要有革命阶段论的观点
    为实现共产主义社会而奋斗，是马克思主义者的最终目的。但是曾经有些人对共产主义抱有一种神秘的观点，把它看作是无限遥远的事业；或者是满足于已有的成果，丧失革命的进取精神，失去对新鲜事物的敏感，对社会主义社会中的共产主义的萌芽，不是采取积极态度，在社会主义建设中为向共产主义过渡积极准备条件，而是采取消极的甚至采取妨碍和压抑的态度；认为
  “革命到顶”，就此止步。这种人的头脑也是爱冷不爱热的。可是，“逆水行舟，不进则退”，一个人只冷不热，久而久之就会蜕化。
    在1958年大跃进的基础上，全国迅速实现了人民公社化，农村人民公社开始实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。这是广大群众的迫切要求，也是社会主义的分配方式上的一种创举——它开始带有共产主义的萌芽，既有利于加速社会主义建设，又有利于为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。对于这种共产主义的萌芽视而不见，无动于衷，甚至加以贬斥，这当然是错误的。这是那些太冷的人的态度。但是对于这样的伟大的开端，某些人的头脑又太热了一些。有的人就主张农村人民公社“立即实行全民所有制”，甚至
  “立即进入共产主义”。这除了使共产主义的伟大理想庸俗化以外，除了在群众中造成思想认识上的混乱以外，不会产生任何积极意义。他们好心一片，但性子太急，热情有余，冷静不足。
      爱冷不爱热或爱热不爱冷
        都是爱形而上学不爱辩证法
    一个人只冷不热，或者是只热不冷，都是形而上学，决不是辩证法。只冷不热，就会得慢性病，就会违反马克思列宁主义的“不断革命论”，在革命的某一发展阶段上停步不前。反之，如果只热不冷，又会得急性病，又会违反否认马克思列宁主义的革命的发展阶段论，陷入企图超越革命的当前阶段而跳入下一阶段的空想。
    如果一个人“见物不见人”，看不见群众的力量，就会冷而不热；反之，如果“见人不见物”，就是只看见人的主观能动性，不看客观的物质条件，也会热而不冷。还在不久以前，曾流行过所谓农业生产每年只能增长百分之几的论点，这就是由于“见物不见人”，看不到人民群众的伟大的主观能动性和创造力量，看不到事物发展中的现实可能性，当然也就不能采取积极态度，发动群众，依靠群众，采取切实步骤，把这种现实的可能性变为现实。这种观点现在已经受到实践经验的无情批判了。可是，也有些人却完全不考虑实际条件办事。有一个地方的一顷小麦试验田，提出了亩产三百万斤的高产指标。作为试验，干劲大，热情高，应该肯定他们的愿望是好的。但是他们却缺乏可靠的根据，没有切切实实的计算，这是头脑只热不冷的表现。把非现实的可能性当作现实的可能性了，这就必然要陷入主观主义的空想。有些同志还不懂得，可能性有非现实的和现实的两种，现实的可能性是指主观和客观条件都具备的可能性，非现实的可能性是指主观和客观条件都不具备的可能性。我们反对看不见事物发展中的现实可能性的保守思想，反对“见物不见人”，也反对忽视客观条件的非现实的空想，反对“见人不见物”。我们主张见人又见物，又热又要冷。
    既然说头脑要冷，是指科学的分析，那末，是不是可以说，那些爱冷不爱热的人们，乃是有了什么科学分析的根据呢？当然不是。上面说过，冷和热是对立的统一，正同客观和主观是对立的统一一样。只讲客观，不讲主观，本身就不是辩证法，同样，只要冷，不要热，本身就违背了科学，是右倾保守的表现，是形而上学机械论的表现。因此当我们提醒那些头脑过热的人们，要他们的头脑冷一点的时候，那些有右倾保守思想的人，那些“观潮派”，“秋后算账派”，也不必趁机混水摸鱼，这样做是枉然的。实践是检验真理的客观标准，1958年大跃进的伟大成就，统统证明了他们的头脑是违反科学的。
      思想方法如果错误
          也会造成冷热失调
    思想方法上的错误，也可能使人们害冷热病。立场和方法是有联系的，又是有区别的。从思想方法上来说，无论爱冷不爱热，或者是爱热不爱冷，都是爱形而上学，不爱辩证法。有的人在看到了工作中的某些缺点的时候，就冷了半截，或者是只看缺点，否认成绩，把个别缺点夸大为全面，把一个指头误认为十个指头，或者是消极被动，怨天尤人，悲观失望，从而在工作中只促退而不促进。另外也有一些人当他们在工作中做出了一点成绩的时候，就容易头脑发热：或者是只看见成绩，不承认缺点，不懂得有了大的成绩也不能忽视小的缺点；或者是骄傲自满，不再进步。两种倾向，虽然程度常常不同，但都是不爱辩证法，偏爱形而上学的表现。
      群众未发动起来多热一点
        群众已发动起来多冷一点
    辩证唯物主义的世界观，要求人们要热又要冷；要热，所以我们提倡解放思想，敢想、敢干，鼓足干劲、力争上游。要冷，所以我们提倡人们要充分认识客观实际，努力使自己的思想认识符合客观事物的发展规律。破迷信并不是破科学，敢想敢干并不是盲目地想盲目地干。
    对于领导者来说，要热又要冷，有其特殊的意义。当要发动群众运动，当群众运动还没有发动起来的时候，在正确掌握党的方针政策的前提下，需要多热一点。反之，当轰轰烈烈的群众运动已经起来了的时候，头脑又应该多冷一点。如此冷热相济，就既可以保证群众的充分发动，又可以保证运动的健康发展。当然，在群众运动的整个过程中，在任何工作中，在任何时候，都必须又要热又要冷，要有炽热的革命热情，又要有冷静科学头脑。
    总之，热和冷相结合，冲天干劲同科学分析相结合。敢想敢干同实事求是相结合。发挥主观能动性同从实际出发相结合，如此等等，是辩证唯物主义所要求的正确的思想方法和工作作风。
