Strive for a Greater Bumper Harvest in Art Creation
By our commentator

1958 has been a year of great harvest for art.

The high tide of the mass art movement is an important characteristic of the new situation of this year's Great Leap Forward in production and cultural revolution. Various forms of art, such as murals, cartoons, comic strips, sculptures, paper-cuts, and arts and crafts, have been mastered and widely used by the workers and peasants to serve politics and the struggle for production, forming a vigorous mass movement. This is unprecedented. This is a great victory for socialist cultural construction.

After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, many professional art workers went to factories and rural areas to participate in production labor, cultural and educational work in the countryside, and the fiery struggles of the workers and peasants. They integrated with the workers and peasants and made great leaps forward in their thinking. Over the past year, art creation has been closely integrated with political movements and the cultural and artistic demands of the masses, creating many new works that fully demonstrate the political enthusiasm and high level of initiative of professional art workers. The emergence of this unprecedentedly prosperous new situation is a great victory for the Party's General Line on the cultural revolution front and the result of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art. It was under such a situation that the National Art Work Conference was held to discuss and study the experience of the art movement and the achievements of art creation over the past year, which may have a great impact on the development of future work. The "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Painting Exhibition" that recently opened in Beijing and the preview for the Socialist Countries Fine Arts Exhibition not long ago exhibited many excellent and popular works in a relatively concentrated manner. They are representative works of art creation in this year's Great Leap Forward. The emergence of these works once again vividly proves that only by closely serving politics, combining with production, and reflecting real life can art works have brilliant artistic life. They vividly express the soaring enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building socialism with charming artistic images and greatly encourage the people. They are examples of the close integration of politics and art. Revolutionary art workers can see from here that it is wrong to talk little about politics, and it is also wrong to talk little about art. Art and politics, thought and technology are a dialectical unity. "Art is politics" and "politics is art" are both violations of the Party's literary and artistic line. In order to create more beautiful works in form that are adapted to revolutionary political content, we hope that all professional and amateur art workers across the country will continue to maintain and exert their abundant revolutionary energy, and conduct more in-depth research on art, and improve further on the existing foundation.

Speaking of improvement, is there no need to talk about popularization anymore? Of course not. If anyone uses improvement as an excuse to stagnate the ongoing mass art movement, this is of course a huge mistake. In order to further widely develop the mass art movement, it is still necessary to vigorously overcome and correct the views that despise popularization and despise mass creation. At the same time, it is also necessary to overcome the past tendency of improving behind closed doors, divorced from politics and the masses. It is not that we do not want to improve, but that we must put improvement on a reliable foundation of popularization. If despising popularization is due to a lack of mass viewpoint, then despising improvement is also a manifestation of a lack of mass viewpoint, because this kind of thinking essentially underestimates the role of art in socialist construction and underestimates the ever-growing demands of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for art appreciation.

We believe that the guidance work for mass art activities is a very prominent issue in the current popularization and improvement. The masses are eager to improve, and therefore require corresponding guidance; however, the guidance work still falls far short of meeting the needs. Lack of manpower is a problem, and there are also many issues worth studying in terms of guidance content and methods. We do not refuse to learn from foreign countries, but we do not agree with forcibly transplanting foreign things to the masses. Foreign things must be digested, and the things of our own national tradition must also be sorted out when they come into our hands. In short, we must proceed from reality. What to guide and how to guide? There are many disputes at present, so there is no need to rush to set specifications. However, to be a good teacher of the masses, we must first be a good student of the masses. This is our most fundamental good experience. How to help the masses further improve the ideological content of their works and improve their artistic skills? The guidance of experts is indispensable, but it is not appropriate to regard the guidance of experts as the only method, because, even in terms of professional manpower, it is currently impossible to fully meet the needs. Under this circumstance, it is very necessary to continue to break superstitions, give full play to the creativity and initiative of the masses, and vigorously promote the experience of "those who are able become teachers" and mutual guidance.

In our art work, we must still adhere to the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom." On the basis of the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, we should widely unite art workers and encourage creative competition in various art forms. Narrow, mechanical, and simplistic views on subject matter, form, and style must continue to be corrected. The people's demands for art are diverse. The people's commune movement, the nationwide steelmaking movement, the nationwide military training movement, etc., should be fully reflected in art. However, we cannot oppose landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings because of this. We cannot understand the Party's literary and artistic policies one-sidedly, and simply view the functions of art and its special laws.

Our art creation team has also greatly expanded, and more people will participate in the art team in the future. In order to meet the needs of the workers and peasants, we hope that all localities will set up more art training classes, amateur art schools, or establish art departments in Red and Expert Universities according to their conditions and possibilities; art colleges should open their doors widely to the workers and peasants in order to absorb and cultivate a large number of worker-peasant art talents. The teaching content, system, and methods of art colleges should also be thoroughly reformed, breaking down the old and establishing the new in a big way, in order to establish a new art education system that truly conforms to the actual situation of the Chinese revolution and meets the needs of the people, and cultivate talents that meet the needs of the actual revolution.

In order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and in order to create excellent art works worthy of the great socialist era, we must resolutely and correctly implement the Party's literary and artistic policies. Under the correct leadership of the Party, let us push the art movement to a new upsurge and strive for a greater harvest next year!

    争取美术创作的更大丰收
    本报评论员
    1958年是美术的一个大丰收年。
    群众美术运动的高涨，是今年生产大跃进和文化革命的新形势的重要特点；美术的种种形式，如壁画、漫画、连环图画、雕塑、剪纸以及工艺美术等等，都被工农群众掌握并且广泛运用起来，为政治服务，为生产斗争服务，形成了气势澎湃的群众运动。这是史无前例的。这是社会主义文化建设的一个伟大胜利。
    许多专业美术工作者经过整风反右斗争之后，下厂下乡，参加生产劳动，参加农村的文教工作，参加了工农群众的火热的斗争，与工农群众相结合，在思想上有很大的跃进。一年来，美术创作与政治运动和群众文化艺术要求紧相结合，创作了很多新的作品，充分表现了专业美术工作者的政治热情和积极性的高涨。这种空前繁荣的新形势的出现，是党的总路线在文化革命战线上的一个伟大胜利，是坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的路线的结果。正是在这样形势之下召开了全国美术工作会议，对一年来美术运动的经验和美术创作的成就进行了讨论、研究，这对于今后工作的开展，可能产生很大的推动作用。最近在北京开幕的“工农兵画展”和不久前为参加社会主义国家造型艺术展览的预展，比较集中地展出了许多优秀的、为群众喜爱的作品。它们是今年大跃进中的美术创作的代表作。这些作品的出现，再一次生动地证明了只有密切地为政治服务、结合生产、反映现实生活，美术作品才能有光辉的艺术生命。它们用富有魅力的艺术形象，生动地表现了我国人民建设社会主义的冲天干劲，给人民以极大的鼓舞。它们是政治和艺术紧密结合的范例。革命的美术工作者可以从这里看到：少谈政治是错误的，少谈艺术也不对。艺术与政治、思想与技术是辩证的统一。“艺术即政治论”和“政治即艺术论”同样都是违反党的文艺方针的。为了创作出更多与革命的政治内容相适应的形式优美的作品，我们希望全国所有的专业和业余的美术工作者，继续保持和发挥充沛的革命干劲，并且对艺术作更深入的钻研，在现有的基础上再提高一步。
    谈到提高，是不是无需再谈普及了呢？当然不是。如果有人以提高为借口使正在开展的群众美术运动停滞不前，这当然是天大的错误。为了把群众美术运动进一步广泛地开展起来，对于轻视普及、轻视群众创作的观点还要大力克服和纠正。同时，也要克服过去的关门提高，脱离政治脱离群众的提高的偏向。不是不要提高，而是要把提高放在可靠的普及基础之上。如果说轻视普及是由于缺乏群众观点，那么，轻视提高也是一种缺乏群众观点的表现，因为这种思想实质上是低估了美术事业在社会主义建设中的作用，低估了工农兵群众对美术欣赏的不断增长的要求。
    我们认为：对于群众美术活动的辅导工作，是目前普及与提高中的一个很突出的问题。群众迫切要求提高，因此也就要求相应地给以辅导；但辅导工作还大大不能满足需要。人力不足是问题，在辅导内容、方法上也有许多问题值得研究。我们不拒绝借鉴外国，但也不赞成把外国的东西硬搬过来塞给群众。外国的东西要经过消化，自己民族传统的东西到我们手中也要加以整理，总之要从实际出发。辅导什么、怎样辅导？目前争论不少，倒不必急于定出规格。但是，要做好群众的先生，必须先做好群众的学生，这一条是我们最根本的好经验。如何帮助群众进一步提高作品的思想性，提高艺术技巧，专家的辅导工作是不可少的，但也不宜把专家的辅导工作视为唯一的方法，因为，即从专业人力上来说，目前也是不可能完全满足需要的。在这种情况之下，继续破除迷信，发挥群众的创造性、积极性，大力推广“能者为师”，相互辅导的经验，很有必要。
    在我们的美术工作中，仍然要坚持党的“百花齐放”的方针。在毛主席所提出来的六条政治标准的基础上，把美术工作者广泛地团结起来，鼓励各种艺术形式的创作竞赛。对于题材、形式、风格的狭隘、机械、简单化的观点，必须继续加以纠正。人民对于艺术的要求，是多种多样的。人民公社运动、全民炼钢运动、全民皆兵运动等等，应当在艺术上得到充分的反映。但也不能因此而反对山水画、花鸟画。不能片面地去理解党的文艺政策，简单地去看待美术的职能和它的特殊规律性。
    我们的美术创作队伍也大大地扩大了，今后还会有更多的人参加到美术队伍里来。为了满足工农群众的需要，希望各地根据条件和可能，多多创办一些美术训练班、业余艺术学校或在红专大学中设立美术系；美术院校对工农群众则应大开门，以便吸收和培养出大批的工农美术人才。美术院校的教学内容、制度、方法，也要加以彻底改造，大破大立，以便建立起真正符合中国革命实际，符合人民需要的新的美术教育体系，培养出符合革命实际需要的人材来。
    为了庆祝建国十周年，为了创作出无愧于伟大的社会主义时代的优秀美术作品，必须坚决正确地贯彻党的文艺方针。在党的正确领导下，把美术运动推向新的高潮，争取来年更大的丰收！
