    On the Necessity of Commodity Production under the Socialist System
    ·"Economic Issues" of the Soviet Union Publishes Special Article·
    The Soviet Union's "Economic Issues" magazine published an article by Batyrev in its eighth issue of 1958, titled "On the Necessity and Essence of Commodity Production under the Socialist System." The article states: Commodity-money relations are the tool by which state-owned production departments establish connections with cooperative collective farm production departments. The historical experience of the first stage of communist society's development proves that under the socialist system there must still be a special form of commodity production, and there must still be commodity-money relations that can express socialist production relations. The necessity of commodity production under the socialist system is not merely due to the existence of collective farm ownership. If one believes that the main reason lies in the mutual relations between state-owned enterprises and collective farm cooperatives, then it will be impossible to explain the essence and causes of commodity-money relations within the state-owned production sector. Some economists believe that a part of social products is produced as commodities, so the production of the rest of the social products must also have commodity characteristics. This argument is also untenable. If, within the state-owned sector, the connection between enterprises is another kind of non-commodity connection (just like the connection between workshops within an enterprise), then the commodity exchange between the state-owned production sector and the collective farm cooperative production sector will never change the nature of the mutual relations within the state-owned production sector.
    The argument that the commodity nature of socialist production is due to the requirements of the law of distribution according to labor is also untenable. First of all, it is theoretically incorrect to say that the nature of production depends on the form of distribution. In addition, distribution according to labor itself does not mean commodity exchange, because labor power is not a commodity under the socialist system. The commodity nature of production under the socialist system is determined by production itself, and it has nothing to do with distribution in the form of use value. On the contrary, the reason why distribution has the nature of commodity circulation is precisely because production itself requires that the amount of social labor consumption must be expressed in terms of commodity value. The argument that the necessity of commodity production under the socialist system is due to the difference in social labor, the difference between the labor of workers in state-owned enterprises and the labor of members of collective farms, the difference between mental labor and physical labor, and the difference between skilled labor and simple labor, is also untenable. Because our problem is precisely to explain why, at the present stage of socialist production development, we cannot use the unit of working time when comparing direct social labor of different qualities, but must adopt an indirect method, that is, using the value of labor products. The reason why various social labor of different qualities cannot be calculated by working time is not due to the difference in labor, but is determined by the nature of direct social labor in the first stage of communism.
    The socialist mode of production can eliminate spontaneous forces in the market, so that it does not play a role in supervising production and coordinating it with social needs. However, before labor becomes the primary need of life, before the materials produced are not yet sufficiently abundant, and before socialist enterprises still need to use material incentives to encourage producers to participate in labor, in other words, during the stage of socialist development, society cannot but use commodity-money categories. It is also necessary to use commodity-money links in the national economy to objectively supervise and encourage the production of each social labor division sector, in order to maximize the satisfaction of social needs.
    The experience of socialist construction proves that the practice of forced abandonment of the principle of open and broad supply of goods and implementation of a rationing system in individual periods violates the requirements of the socialist law of distribution according to labor, and also fails to effectively supervise the production of consumer goods, so that it adapts to the activities of the commodity transmission network. With the increase in purchase and acquisition prices, the monetary income of collective farms and members has greatly increased, and the stimulating effect of monetary income on improving labor productivity and improving production organization has also increased. Monthly advance payments to collective farm members and other methods related to adjusting labor remuneration play a significant role in the development of commodity-money relations. The government has also taken various measures to adjust the working capital of collective farms, adjust the settlement methods between collective farms and state-owned enterprises, all of which are to reduce the scope of the role of in-kind relations.
    With these facts, it can be clearly seen that the following popular arguments in the past are wrong: it seems that expanding the scope of commodity circulation will delay the speed of moving towards communism; it is necessary to reduce the scope of commodity circulation and expand the scope of product exchange; only product exchange can create conditions for incorporating collective farm production into the national plan, and so on.
    It can be seen that not only cannot commodity production and commodity-money relations be abolished in the near future, but there are no objective conditions to do so for a long time to come.

### 论社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性

    论社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性
    ·苏联“经济问题”杂志发表专文·
    苏联“经济问题”杂志1958年第八期发表了巴蒂列夫“论社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性和本质”一文。文章说：商品货币关系是国营生产部门与合作社集体农庄生产部门之间借以建立联系的工具。共产主义第一阶段社会发展的历史经验证明，在社会主义制度下仍然要有一种特殊形式的商品生产，仍然要有能够表现出社会主义生产关系的商品货币关系。社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性并不仅仅由于集体农庄所有制的存在。如果认为主要原因在于国营企业与集体农庄合作社的相互关系，那末要想说明国营生产部门内部的商品货币关系的本质和原因就会有不可克服的困难。某些经济学家认为，社会产品的一部分是作为商品而生产的，因此其余社会产品的生产也一定带有商品性。这种论点也站不住脚。假如在国营部门内部，各企业之间的联系是另外一种非商品性的联系（也如企业内部各个车间相互之间的联系一样），那末国营生产部门与集体农庄合作社营生产部门之间商品交换也绝不会改变国营生产部门内部之间相互关系的性质。
    想把社会主义生产的商品性说成是由于按劳分配规律的要求的这种论断也不能成立。首先，生产性质取决于分配形式，理论上就是不正确的。此外，按劳分配本身并不意味着商品交换，因为在社会主义制度下劳动力不是商品。社会主义制度下生产之所以带有商品性是由生产本身决定的，它与利用价值形式进行分配无关，恰恰相反，分配之所以带有商品流转性质是由于生产本身要求必须用商品价值来表现社会劳动消耗量。把社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性说成是由于社会劳动不同，说成是由于国营企业职工劳动与集体农庄庄员劳动有区别，由于脑力劳动与体力劳动有区别，由于熟练劳动与简单劳动有区别，这种论点也站不住脚。因为我们的问题恰恰是要说明，在社会主义生产发展的现阶段在比较质量不同的直接社会劳动时为什么不能利用单位工作时间，而必须采取间接办法，即利用劳动产品价值。质量不同的各种社会劳动之所以不能用工作时间来计算，并不是由于劳动的这种不同，而是由共产主义第一阶段直接社会劳动的性质决定的。
    社会主义生产方式能够消灭市场上的自发势力，使它在监督生产与社会需要相协调这方面不起作用。但是，在劳动还没有成为人生第一需要以前，在生产出来的物资还不十分充足以前，在社会主义企业还需要利用物资鼓励办法吸收生产者参加劳动以前，换言之，也就是在社会主义发展阶段，社会就不能不利用商品货币范畴。还必须利用国民经济中的商品货币联系来客观地监督和鼓励每个社会劳动分工部门的生产，以便能最大限度满足社会需要。
    社会主义建设经验证明，在个别时期迫不得已放弃公开广泛供应的卖货原则而实行定量供应制的这种作法，违反了社会主义按劳分配规律的要求，而且也不能很好地监督消费品生产，使之与商品传送网的活动相适应。随着征购和收购价格的提高，集体农庄和庄员的货币收入大大增加了，货币收入对提高劳动生产率和改进生产组织所起的刺激作用也提高了。按月发给集体农庄庄员预付款以及其他有关调整劳动报酬的各种办法，对发展商品货币关系起很大的作用。政府还采取了各种措施来调整集体农庄的流动资金、调整集体农庄与国营企业的结算办法，所有这些也都是为了缩小实物关系起作用的范围。
    有了这些事实就可以很清楚地看到，以前流行的下列这些论点是错误的：似乎扩大商品流通范围就要推迟向共产主义迈进的速度；必须缩小商品流通的范围，扩大产品交换的范围；只有产品交换才能够创造出条件把集体农庄生产纳入全民计划，等等。
    由此可见，不仅在最近将来不能废除商品生产和商品货币关系，而且今后很长时期内也没有客观条件这样做。
