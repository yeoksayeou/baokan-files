The mass line in copper smelting industry
Ma Jikong, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In Yunnan, the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and the large-scale mass copper smelting movement have given ancient mines unlimited youthful vitality, enabling copper mines that have been stagnant and dormant for decades to contribute to the country with a leap-forward attitude. This large-scale mass copper smelting movement began after the Central Committee issued instructions at the Beidaihe Conference in September this year. After two high-yield weeks in October and November, some copper mines have initially passed the technical barrier of indigenous copper smelting and achieved certain results.

Yunnan is rich in copper resources. According to preliminary exploration, millions of tons of metal ore can be obtained, indicating that the copper smelting industry has a promising future. As early as two hundred years ago, Yunnan had a history of indigenous copper smelting, accumulating certain experience in indigenous methods. In addition, fuel resources are relatively abundant, which provides better conditions for large-scale copper smelting. However, most of the copper mines are located in deep mountains and old forests, making transportation inconvenient. Most of the copper ore veins are layered (narrow veins), requiring ventilation and drainage equipment for drilling and mining. Moreover, copper ore has a much lower grade than iron ore, and is mostly reticulated ore, sandstone, and gravel, requiring crushing and ore dressing, which requires more equipment and labor. These complex conditions have created many difficulties for large-scale copper smelting.

Before liberation, copper smelting in Yunnan was basically at a standstill. After liberation, the main work was geological exploration of copper mines, and some basic construction was started, but production was never taken up. In the past, using indigenous methods for copper smelting was also considered, but it was not realized. The reasons are: on the one hand, social reforms were not completed at that time, and it was difficult to mobilize the masses to carry out large-scale work before cooperativization; more importantly, there was the idea of "emphasizing foreign and neglecting indigenous," fearing that adopting indigenous methods would damage the ore body and worrying that the recovery rate would be low, wasting resources. Therefore, for eight or nine years, it has been in a state of static exploration, testing, analysis, design, and construction. Therefore, all places that are prepared to engage in "large foreign" enterprises have not produced even a pound of copper.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the wave of the whole people running industry has broken the silence of the copper smelting industry. In particular, the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," as well as the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on vigorously developing the copper and aluminum industries, which proposed a broad road for large-scale copper smelting. At this point, we resolutely adopted the method of focusing on indigenous methods, semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. According to the specific conditions of Yunnan, copper was listed as the "deputy commander," and the slogan of "steel and copper going hand in hand" was put forward. In practice, the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" has shown great power. Copper ore mining and dressing not only require a large amount of labor, but also improper mining and dressing can easily cause great difficulties in smelting, and even no copper can be smelted. Therefore, the focus of combining indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, is concentrated on the two key steps of mining and dressing. The process of overcoming this difficulty is the process from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups" and then to foreign methods. Initially, indigenous machinery was generally used to mine and dress ore instead of manual operation, and then some "foreign tails" were added, that is, equipping certain ventilation, power, etc., to transition to semi-indigenous and semi-foreign. At present, some areas have begun to engage in mass technical innovations, such as using foot-operated hanging hammer drilling machines, wooden rail wooden mine cars, wooden indigenous winches, and indigenous cableways in mining and transportation; in ore dressing, using hydraulic and animal power grinding, mills, hammer mills, and wooden ball mills and other crushing equipment; all have increased efficiency several times. For example, after nine kinds of indigenous mechanized ore dressing tools were used on the ore dressing site of the Bangping Copper Mine in Mojiang, the efficiency was increased by four or five times compared with manual selection, and the ore grade was increased from 0.4% to 1% to about 10%. It is precisely by adopting these methods from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods, that the situation of stagnation due to mining and dressing difficulties has been broken, and a high tide of mass copper smelting has been set off throughout the province.

The policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" embodies the mass line of running industry. The process of implementing this policy is the process of relying on and mobilizing the broad masses. Without the hands-on work of the broad masses, it would be impossible to obtain a large amount of copper in a short period of time, and it would be impossible for labor-saving and efficient "large foreign" enterprises to emerge quickly. And the whole people engaging in copper mainly relies on and mobilizes the peasant masses. Without a large number of peasants, there is no question of a vigorous mass movement. Therefore, the fundamental problem lies in relying on and mobilizing the peasants. Full political mobilization, explaining to the peasants the relationship between copper smelting and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and clarifying the important significance of our province's unshirkable support for the whole country, thereby encouraging the peasant masses' high political enthusiasm, occupies a primary position in mobilizing the masses to smelt copper. Most of Yunnan's copper mines are located in plateaus on the plateau, with high mountains and deep forests, cold climate, and inconvenient supply, but the fighting spirit of millions of migrant workers has never waned, mainly because the masses recognize the relationship between copper smelting and their own vital interests. However, copper smelting is unfamiliar to the vast number of peasants, and they do not even know what copper matte and blister copper look like, let alone ore dressing and smelting. And quickly smelting copper is not only the requirement of the country, but also the requirement of the peasants. Wherever copper is smelted, the masses have high political enthusiasm. Wherever copper cannot be produced for a long time, the emotions of the masses are affected. Therefore, on the basis of political mobilization of the masses, quickly guiding the peasant masses to break through the technical barrier is of decisive significance. In this situation, we adopted the mass line method to mobilize the masses to break through the technical barrier, which made the mass copper smelting movement a big step forward and also made copper smelting achieve great results. At that time, starting from the specific situation in our province, the methods of "three sides" and "three combinations" were used to help the peasant masses master the technology more quickly. Although our province has experience in indigenous copper smelting, there are very few old workers left. After liberation, most of the copper mine bases first had geological exploration, then basic construction, and then smelting production. However, the large-scale mass movement does not allow following the procedures of exploration, construction, and production. Therefore, the method of "three sides" - side exploration, side construction, and side production - was adopted. The geological exploration team, on the basis of drilling and exploration, used its power and other equipment to guide smelting, ore dressing, and testing. The basic construction unit, on the one hand, focused on basic construction, and on the other hand, squeezed out some of the power and machinery used for basic construction for mining and smelting, adopted indigenous manual selection, and carried out indigenous copper smelting, so as to achieve a double leap forward in basic construction and production. At the same time, basic construction and exploration departments actively promoted and cultivated a large number of all-rounders. This break-up of the step-by-step three-sided approach has played a significant role in copper smelting. Yunnan's Jinsha River, Yimen, Wenjiang and other copper mines have all adopted this method, obtaining a large amount of copper, and at the same time, they have also passed on technical knowledge to the peasant masses, cultivating technical forces for foreign copper smelting.

In the entire process of breaking through the technical barrier, the method of "three combinations" is a mass line method with universal significance, namely: the combination of cadres, technicians, and the masses, the combination of new and old, and the combination of politics and technology. At the same time, it emphasized that cadres should take the lead in learning technology and breaking through the technical barrier. Many areas have established secretary furnaces and experimental furnaces, forming a upsurge of everyone learning technology and everyone teaching technology. In this mass movement of learning technology, many people have mastered more complex technologies such as furnace front, batching, and ore dressing, so that new furnaces produce copper, and abnormal old furnaces return to normal. Practice has proved that mastering copper smelting technology is neither mysterious nor simple. As long as we adhere to the mass line method, adopt "three sides" and "three combinations," and let the masses learn and master it, and fix workers in technical jobs, the technical barrier can be quickly broken through. After the technical barrier is initially broken through, we must pay attention to improving on the basis of popularization as the development progresses from indigenous to foreign, and constantly guide the masses to further master and learn technology. At present, we are working on solving this problem.

Vigorously developing copper production is Yunnan people's unshirkable glorious task to the country. We are prepared to use the strength of geological exploration and basic construction teams to conduct side exploration, side mining, and side smelting, and carry out technical equipment in a planned way: all rich ores that can be manually selected should be equipped with smelting first, and all those that are not easy to manually select, such as sandstone and reticulated ores, should be equipped with ore dressing first, and engage in semi-mechanization to improve efficiency and save a lot of labor. From the perspective of development, it will transition from "small indigenous groups" to "small foreign groups," and strive to engage in some "large foreign groups"; from indigenous machinery to semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, and then to foreign. Because it is much more difficult to equip than iron smelting, especially in mining and dressing, we mainly rely on self-reliance to equip indigenous and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign equipment. Next year, our province plans to produce tens of thousands of tons of copper, and each ton of copper smelting roughly requires the capacity of equipping more than two tons of mining, dressing, smelting and transportation machinery and equipment. In this way, the province will need to equip hundreds of thousands of tons of machinery and equipment next year. This is an arduous task. In addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to engage in "small indigenous groups," according to the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," we are prepared to strive to build some "medium foreign groups" and even "large foreign groups." We believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee, under the guidance of correct policies, and with the support of various places, as long as we adhere to relying on and mobilizing the masses, and continue to implement the mass line on the copper smelting front, these difficulties can be solved.

    炼铜工业中的群众路线
    中共云南省委书记  马继孔
    在云南，“土洋并举”的方针和大规模的群众炼铜运动，赋予了古老矿山以无限的青春活力，使停顿、沉睡了数十年的铜矿，以跃进的姿态，为国家贡献力量。这个大规模的群众炼铜运动，是在今年9月北戴河会议中央发出指示后开始的，经过10月和11月两次高产周，部分铜矿已初步过了土法炼铜技术关，取得了一定的成绩。
    云南蕴藏着丰富的铜矿资源，据初步勘探，可拿到几百万吨的金属矿量，说明炼铜的事业是很有前途的。远在二百多年以前，云南就有了土法炼铜的历史，积累了一定的土法炼铜的经验，兼之燃料资源较丰富，为大规模炼铜准备了较好的条件。但是，由于铜矿大多在深山老箐之中，交通运输不便；铜矿矿脉又大多是层状矿（矿脉窄），必须具有打硐开采的通风、排水设备；加之铜矿比铁矿品位低的多，又多是网状矿、沙石岩，又需碎矿选矿，需要的设备和劳力均较大。这些复杂的条件，造成了大规模炼铜的许多困难。
    解放前，云南炼铜已基本上处于停顿状态，解放后，主要进行了铜矿的地质勘探工作，并着手进行了一些基本建设，但一直未把生产抓起来。过去，也曾考虑到用土法炼铜，但是，并未实现。其原因：一方面由于当时社会改革未完成，在合作化前发动群众大搞有困难；更重要的是由于存在着“重洋轻土”的思想，怕采取土办法破坏矿体，耽心回收率低，浪费资源。因此，八、九年来，一直处于静止地勘探、化验、分析、设计和基建之中，因而，凡是准备大搞“大洋”企业的地方，连一斤铜也未拿出。
    大跃进以来，全民办工业的浪潮打破了炼铜工业的沉默。特别是党中央提出了“土洋并举”的方针，以及中共中央和国务院关于大力发展铜、铝工业的指示，为大规模炼铜提出了一条广阔的道路。至此，我们坚决采取了以土为主、半土半洋、由土到洋、土洋结合的办法，并且根据云南的具体情况，把铜列为“副帅”，提出了“钢铜并举”的口号。在实践中，“土洋并举”的方针，显示出巨大的力量。铜矿的采选，不仅需要大量的劳动力，而且采选不当，最易造成冶炼的极大困难，甚至炼不出铜来。因此，土洋并举、由土到洋的焦点集中于采、选两关。克服这一困难的过程，即由“小土群”到“小洋群”一直过渡到洋办法的过程。最初，一般采用了土机械来采选矿代替手工操作，继而加上一些“洋尾巴”，即装备一定的鼓风、动力等等，向半土半洋过渡。目前有些地区已开始搞群众性的技术革新，如在采矿和运输方面采用脚踏吊锤打眼机、木轨木矿车、木质土卷扬机、土索道等；选矿方面，采用水力、畜力的碾、磨、锤碓，以及木质球磨机等碎矿设备；都使效率成倍地提高。像墨江蚌坪铜矿选矿工地上采用了九种土机械化选矿工具后，比手选效率提高四、五倍，并使矿石品位由0.4％—1％提高到10％左右。正是采取了这些由土到洋、土洋并举的办法，冲破了由于采选困难因而裹足不前的局面，在全省掀起了全民炼铜的高潮。
    “土洋并举”的方针，体现了办工业的群众路线。执行这个方针的过程，就是依靠和发动广大群众的过程。没有广大群众的动手动脚，就不可能在短期获得大量的铜，也就不可能迅速出现节约劳力、效率高的“大洋”企业。而全民搞铜，主要又是依靠和发动农民群众，没有为数众多的农民，就谈不上轰轰烈烈的群众运动。因此，根本问题在于依靠和发动农民。政治上的充分动员，向农民讲明炼铜对于国家、农业机械化电气化的关系，讲清是我省责无旁贷的支援全国的重要意义，从而鼓舞农民群众的高涨政治热情，在发动群众炼铜当中，占有首要的地位。云南的铜矿大多处于高原上的高原中，山高箐深，气候寒冷，供应不便，但是，百万民工斗志始终不衰，主要是群众认识到炼铜与其切身利益的关系。但是，炼铜对于广大农民来说，是陌生的，甚至于连冰铜、粗铜是什么样都不认识，更谈不上选矿、冶炼了。而迅速炼出铜来，不仅是国家的要求，也是农民的要求。凡是炼出铜来的地方，群众政治热情高。凡是久久不能出铜的地方，群众情绪就受影响。因此，在群众有了政治发动的基础上，迅速引导农民群众突破技术关，就带有决定性的意义。在此情况下，我们采取群众路线的方法，发动群众突破技术关，这样就使群众性的炼铜运动深入了一大步，也使炼铜取得了巨大的成绩。当时，从我省具体情况出发，运用了“三边”“三结合”的方法，帮助农民群众较快地掌握了技术。我省虽有土法炼铜的经验，但老工人已寥寥无几，而解放后铜矿基地又大多是先有地质勘探，后有基本建设，再有冶炼生产。但是大规模的群众运动，不容许按着勘探、基建、生产的程序办事，因此，就采取了“三边”——边勘探、边基建、边生产的方法。地质勘探队伍，在打硐勘探的基础上，利用其动力等设备，指导冶炼、选矿、化验。基本建设单位，则采取一边以基建为主，一边挤出部分基建所用的动力和机械进行采掘和冶炼，采取土法手选，进行土法炼铜，作到基建生产双跃进。同时，在基建、勘探部门，都积极提倡和大量培养多面手。这种打破按部就班的三边作法，在炼铜上起了显著作用。云南金沙江、易门、文江等铜矿，都是采取这种办法，拿到了大量的铜，同时，也把技术知识传授给农民群众，为洋法炼铜培养了技术力量。
    在整个突破技术关的过程中，“三结合”的办法，是带有普遍意义的群众路线的方法，即：干部、技术人员、群众相结合，新老相结合，政治与技术相结合。同时，强调了干部带头学技术，突破技术关。很多地区都建立了书记炉、试验炉，形成了人人学技术、人人教技术的热潮。在这种群众性学习技术的运动中，有不少群众掌握炉前、配料、选矿等较为复杂的技术，使新炉出了铜，不正常的老炉转为正常。实践证明：掌握炼铜技术，既不神秘，也不简单。只要坚持群众路线的方法，采取“三边”“三结合”，放手让群众学习、掌握，并在技术工种上固定工人，技术关是可以迅速突破的。当技术关初步突破后，必须随着由土到洋的发展，注意在普及的基础上提高，不断地引导群众进一步掌握和学习技术。目前，我们正在着手解决这个问题。
    大力发展铜的生产，是云南人民对国家的义不容辞的光荣任务。我们准备利用地质勘探和基本建设队伍的力量，边勘探、边采矿、边冶炼，有步骤地进行技术装备：凡是能进行手选的富矿，就首先装备冶炼，凡是不易手选的，如沙岩、网状矿，就要首先装备选矿，搞半机械化，以提高效率，并大量节约劳动力。从发展来看，将要由“小土群”向“小洋群”过渡，并争取搞部分“大洋群”；由土机械到半土半洋，再到洋。由于在装备上比炼铁困难得多，特别是采、选方面，我们主要的是依靠自力更生，装备土的、半土半洋的设备。明年我省计划生产几万吨铜，而每炼一吨铜，大体上需要装备两吨重以上的采选炼和运输机械设备能力，这样，全省明年需要装备十几万吨的机械设备才行。这是一个艰巨的任务。除继续发动群众大搞“小土群”以外，根据“土洋并举”的方针，准备争取建设一些“中洋群”以至“大洋群”。我们相信，在中央的领导下，在正确方针的指导下，并在各地支援下，只要我们坚持依靠和发动群众，继续贯彻炼铜战线上的群众路线，这些困难是有可能解决的。
