Revolution in Loading and Unloading Work
The General Branch Committee of the CPC Tangshan Railway Station

Twice Bumping into Walls, Finding a Way Out

Like other railway stations across the country, Tangshan Railway Station faced a continuous increase in loading and unloading tasks due to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rapid rise in railway transportation. The daily average loading was 200 cars in the first half of the year, and after the second half of the year, the daily average loading was 350 cars, an increase of 75%. The unloading task increased even faster, with a daily average of 176 cars in the first half of the year, rising to 350 to 430 cars after September, an increase of 99% to 144%. The sudden increase in loading and unloading tasks, while the loading and unloading labor force and equipment remained the same as before, created a very sharp contradiction, resulting in a passive situation of not being able to unload cars and not being able to load empty cars. Without resolving this contradiction and freeing ourselves from this passive situation, we could not play the role of a "pioneer."

What to do?

The first solution we thought of was to supplement the loading and unloading force. The station sent cadres to the Tangshan City Labor Bureau, the Changli Special District, and the Fengrun County People's Committee to request help in solving the labor force problem. However, everywhere we went, the answer was that the labor force was tight and no one could be spared. We also thought of adding modern loading and unloading machinery to improve the efficiency of loading and unloading operations and solve the contradiction between tasks and manpower. However, adding equipment requires money first, and without money, it won't work. At this time, the workers learned about this. They heard that adding a dozen belt conveyors would not only improve loading and unloading efficiency but also greatly reduce labor intensity, and they were very enthusiastic. Some even suggested, "It doesn't matter if we don't have money, we can raise funds through voluntary labor." At that time, our leadership ideology was not very calm, and we thought this was a way, so we organized the masses to participate in voluntary labor, trying to solve the funding problem through "mass investment." As a result, after a week of hard work, we only got 900 yuan, while a single belt conveyor cost 6,000 yuan. The workers said, "We can't even buy a leg of the machine." Of course, it was even more impossible to buy a dozen belt conveyors using this method. Moreover, we later found out that belt conveyors were simply not available, and even if we placed a temporary order, we didn't know how long we would have to wait. This path was clearly not going to work.

Adding manpower didn't work, and adding equipment didn't work either. Bumping into walls on both paths showed that our guiding ideology was very unclear from the beginning. Although the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, it was not organized in the right direction due to the unclear leadership ideology. The Party organization summarized these lessons and proposed mobilizing the masses, combining with reality, and relying on our own efforts to solve the contradiction between the loading and unloading force and the loading and unloading tasks. At this time, we found a way to build high platforms and dig low cargo spaces. The seeds of this method had actually been there for a long time. Previously, when workers were loading cars, they found that if they raised the ground a little, loading cars from a high place to a low place would save effort and be faster. Sometimes, they would find some soil to put under their feet. We studied this practice of raising the platform and considered it a simple and easy way to improve loading and unloading efficiency and solve the problem of insufficient loading and unloading force, so we chose to take this path.

Mobilizing the Masses, Relying on Our Own Efforts

Building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces is a major technical revolution in loading and unloading operations. However, in the beginning, not everyone's understanding was the same. Some people doubted whether building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces could solve the contradiction between loading and unloading force and loading and unloading tasks, and even thought it was simply "absurd nonsense." They said, "Building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces requires people, and loading and unloading is precisely short of people. Taking people away to build high platforms is like 'giving salt to a thirsty person.'" However, most people, especially the loading and unloading workers, actively supported building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces. They believed that this was not only the most practical way to solve the current difficulty of insufficient loading and unloading force but also another liberation for the loading and unloading workers. Chen Taiquan, a retired old loading and unloading worker, said, "I have worked as a loading and unloading worker all my life and have been oppressed all my life. Building a high platform will save effort." In response to these ideological situations, the Party organization organized the masses to speak out freely, debate, and criticize the doubts about building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces, laying the ideological foundation for promoting this new loading and unloading method.

Following this was overcoming the technical hurdles. Building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces required selecting locations for design and also required partial improvement of the lines. There were no engineering technicians at the station, and some people thought they couldn't do it themselves. But we resolutely relied on the masses, organized the cadres from the engineering and safety supervision departments who had been sent down, as well as the station's train operation commanders, to study together and design on our own. During construction, there were no bricklayers, so we went to the workers to find them and mobilized the masses to sign up voluntarily. As a result, we found that many people could do the work of bricklayers, ironworkers, carpenters, blacksmiths, fitters, and foundry workers. In this way, we also built our own iron factory and manufactured our own construction tools.

The problem of materials was also solved by mobilizing the masses. The construction used more than 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork, more than 1,000 cubic meters of rubble, 200 tons of lime, and a large amount of furnace ash, all of which were solved by the masses themselves. For example, an old worker discovered that there was rubble in two large pits near the station, so he organized the masses to turn over the pits and pick up the soil, digging out more than 400 cubic meters of rubble. The white ash was also obtained by old workers visiting local residents, discovering that there was a kiln bottom in the new stone yard. After the workers dug out the soil layer above the original kiln site, they extracted it.

With design, materials, and tools all available, the remaining problem was labor. The labor used to build high platforms and dig low cargo spaces at Tangshan Railway Station was composed of three types of personnel: first, station employees participating in voluntary labor; second, family members of employees; and third, students coming to the station to participate in voluntary labor. We knew that labor was very valuable and that the project was very dispersed, so we paid special attention to rationally organizing labor, improving labor efficiency, and ensuring the progress of the project.

Because we relied on the masses from beginning to end and relied on our own efforts, we did not spend a penny of the state's money and built eight high platforms of different heights in a very short period of time.

The Superiority of High Platforms

Tangshan City is a heavy industrial city in Hebei Province, and the station's loading and unloading operations are very complex, including industrial and agricultural raw materials, construction materials, and daily necessities. However, the bulk goods are still loose goods such as ballast, rubble, topsoil, and coke. In response to this operational characteristic, we built four different types of high platforms:

One type is a double-sided, dual-purpose platform. The characteristic of this platform is that there is a line in the middle, and high platforms are set up on both sides, which can load goods at the same time. In order to make this platform able to load both open-top cars and boxcars, we set the height of the platform to 2.1 meters according to the height of the open-top car side and also left some垛口 at 1.1 meters according to the height of the boxcar bottom, using these 垛口 to load boxcars.

One type is a high platform on one side and an ordinary platform on the other side. The high side of this platform can load bulk goods, and the ordinary side can load ordinary goods or unload ordinary goods.

One type is a high platform on one side. The characteristic of this platform is that a high platform is set up on one side of the line, which can load bulk goods. The other side of the line does not have a platform, which can slide off bulk goods and can also unload ordinary goods.

There is also a dual-purpose platform with one side high and one side low, with low cargo spaces dug outside. This type of platform is the opposite of the first type of platform. The platform is built in the middle of two lines, and the platform surface is inclined, with one side high and one side low. The high side is 1.8 meters, and the low side is 1.1 meters, and it is 20 meters wide. The high side is suitable for loading bulk goods, and the low side is suitable for loading ordinary goods or unloading ordinary goods. The low cargo spaces outside the line can slide off bulk goods. This high platform is a more advanced multi-purpose high platform than other types of high platforms, but it requires a certain width, so it needs a wider site.

After building high platforms and digging low cargo spaces, it showed great superiority. The labor intensity of loading and unloading workers was reduced, and the loading and unloading effect was greatly improved. In the past, loading a car of coke took 110 minutes, but now it only takes 45 minutes, increasing efficiency by 120%. In the past, loading a car of rubble took 90 minutes, but now it only takes 20 minutes, increasing efficiency by 350%, and with fewer people used. Due to the increased loading and unloading efficiency, the dwell time of vehicles at the station was shortened, which can speed up the turnover of vehicles and transport more things.

Of course, the high platforms we built also have some shortcomings. For example, due to inadequate consideration at the time, sewers were not built, and there are drainage problems during the rainy season. The slope of the horse cart road at both ends of the platform is also too steep, making it inconvenient for horse carts to go up and down. These need to be further improved in future work.

    装卸工作上的革命
    中共唐山车站总支委员会
    两次碰壁  找到出路
    唐山车站和全国其他车站一样，在工农业生产大跃进、铁路运输直线上升的情况下，装卸任务不断增长。上半年每日平均装二百车，下半年后，每日平均装三百五十车，任务增长了75％。卸车任务增长更快，上半年每日平均卸一百七十六车，9月份以后就上升到三百五十车至四百三十车，任务增长了99％至144％。装卸任务骤增，装卸劳动力和装卸设备却还同以前一样，这就出现了非常尖锐的矛盾，造成有车卸不下、空车装不上等被动局面；不解决这个矛盾，不从被动状况中解脱出来，就不能发挥“先行官”的作用。
    怎么办呢？
    我们首先想到的办法是补充装卸力量。车站曾派了干部到唐山市劳动局、昌黎专区和丰润县人委会去联系，请求帮助解决劳动力的问题。但是，走到哪里，哪里都回答说劳动力紧张，抽不出人来。我们又想到用添置现代化装卸机具的办法，来提高装卸作业效率，解决任务和力量之间的矛盾。但是，添置设备首先要有钱，没有钱还是不行。这时，工人们知道了这件事。他们听说要添置十几台皮带运输机，不仅可以提高装卸效率，而且可以大大减轻劳动强度，热情很高，有的还提出“没有钱不要紧，我们用义务劳动的办法筹集资金”。当时，我们的领导思想很不冷静，以为这是一个办法，就组织群众参加义务劳动，企图用“群众投资”的方法来解决资金问题。结果，苦战一周只得了九百元，而一台皮带运输机就要六千元。工人们说“连一条机器腿都买不回来”，要用这种办法买回十几台皮带运输机，当然更不可能。而且后来又打听到，皮带运输机根本买不到，临时订货也不知要等到何时。这条路，显然走不下去了。
    添人不行，添设备也不行，两条路都碰了壁，这说明我们的指导思想在一开始的时候是很不明确的；群众的热情虽然很高，但由于领导思想不明确，也没有被组织到正确的方向上来。党组织总结了这些教训，提出发动群众，结合实际，自力更生来解决装卸力量和装卸任务之间的矛盾。这时候，就找到了筑高站台、挖低货位的办法。这种办法的萌芽，其实是早就有的。以前工人们装车时，就发现如果把地垫高一些，由高处往低处装车，就能省些力，也可以装得快些。有时，他们就找些土来垫在脚下。我们研究了这种垫高站台的做法，认为是一个提高装卸效率、解决装卸力量不足的简便易行的办法，就选定走这条道路。
    发动群众  自力更生
    筑高站台、挖低货位，是装卸作业上一项重大的技术革命。但是，在一开始的时候，并不是大家的认识都很一致的。有些人怀疑筑高站台、挖低货位能不能解决装卸力量和装卸任务之间的矛盾，甚至认为这简直是“荒唐的无稽之谈”。他们说：“筑高站台、挖低货位就要人，而装卸上正缺人，再抽人出去筑高站台，等于‘人渴了给盐吃’”。但是，大多数人，特别是装卸工人，却积极赞同筑高站台、挖低货位。他们认为这不只是解决当前装卸力量不足的困难的最实际的办法，而且是装卸工人的又一次翻身，一位退休的老装卸工人陈太泉说：“我干了一辈子装卸工，挨了一辈子压，修了高站台就省力了”。党组织针对这些思想情况，组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，批判了对筑高站台、挖低货位的怀疑，为推行这种新的装卸方法，奠定了思想基础。
    跟着是过技术关。筑高站台、挖低货位，要选择地点进行设计，还要对线路进行部分改善。车站上没有工程技术人员，有些人以为自己不能搞。但我们坚决依靠群众，组织工务部门和安全监察部门的下放干部，以及车站行车指挥人员，共同研究，自行设计。施工中没有泥瓦工，就到工人中间去寻访，发动群众自动报名。结果，发现不少人会做泥瓦工、铁工、木工、锻工、钳工、翻砂工的工作。这样，又自建了铁工厂，自己制造施工用具。
    材料问题也是发动群众来解决的。施工中共用了二万多立方公尺土方、一千多立方公尺片石、二百吨石灰，还有大量炉灰，都是群众自己解决的。例如，老工人发现车站附近两个大坑里有片石，就组织群众翻坑挑土，挖出四百多立方公尺片石。白灰，也是老工人到当地居民中去访问，发现新石场有个窑底子，经工人挖出原来窑地上面的土层，取出来的。
    设计、材料、工具都有了，剩下的是劳动力的问题。唐山车站筑高站台、挖低货位所用的劳动力，是由三方面的人员组成的：一是车站职工参加义务劳动；二是职工家属；三是来车站参加义务劳动的学生。我们知道，劳动力是非常宝贵的，工程又很分散，因此特别注意到合理地组织劳力，提高劳动效率，保证了工程的进展。
    由于自始至终依靠群众，自力更生，我们没有花国家一文钱，在一个很短的时期内，就修建了八座高低不同的高站台。
    高站台的优越性
    唐山市是河北省的一个重工业城市，车站装卸作业品种很复杂，工农业原料、建设器材、日用百货，什么都有，但大宗货物还是石碴、片石、山皮土、焦炭等散装货物。针对这种作业上的特点，我们修建的高站台有四种不同的类型：
    一种是两面双用站台。这种站台的特点是中间是线路，两边都设有高站台，同时可以装货。为了使这种站台既可装敞车，也可以装棚车，就根据敞车车帮的高度，把站台的高度定为二点一公尺，又根据棚车车底的高度，在一点一公尺处留一些垛口，用这些垛口装棚车。
    一种是一面高站台，一面普通站台。这种站台高的一面可以装散装货物，普通的一面可以装普通货物或卸普通货物。
    一种是一面高站台。这种站台的特点是线路的一面设高站台，可以装散装货物；线路的另一面不设站台，可以溜卸散装货物，也可以卸普通货物。
    还有一种是一边高、一边低的两用站台，外面再挖低货位。这类站台同第一类站台相反，站台修在两条线路中间，台面是斜的，一边高，一边低。高的一边一点八公尺，低的一边一点一公尺，宽二十公尺。高的一边适用于装散装货物，低的一边适用于装普通货物或卸普通货物。线路外面的低货位可以溜卸散装货物。这种高站台是一种比其他类型的高站台更为先进的多用高站台，但是它需要具备一定的宽度，因此要有较宽的场地。
    筑高站台、挖低货位之后，显示出极大的优越性。装卸工人的劳动强度减轻了，装卸效果大大地提高。以前装一车焦炭，要一百一十分钟，现在只要四十五分钟，提高效率120％，以前装一车片石要九十分钟，现在只要二十分钟，提高效率350％，并且用的人还少了。由于装卸效率提高，缩短了车辆在站的停留时间，就能加快车辆的周转，运输更多的东西。
    当然，我们修建的高站台也有一些缺点。例如，由于当时考虑不周，没有修下水道，雨季排水有问题；站台两端的马车道坡度也太大，马车上下不方便。这些都需要在今后的工作中继续改善。
