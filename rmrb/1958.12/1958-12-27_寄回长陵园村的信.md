A Letter Sent Back to Changlingyuan Village

Dear Elders:

It's only been two or three days since I left you, but these two or three days have been so hard to bear! Whether I'm working or resting, I feel empty inside. Changlingyuan Village is my home, and I truly felt reluctant to leave.

I was afraid that Erpingtou would cry and make a fuss when I left, so I didn't tell him. He happened to be at school. Did he make a fuss after school? If he did, tell him that Brother Ji will be back to see him in the village on New Year's Day, and I will definitely bring him a picture book with Chairman Mao's image on it.

When I got back to school, it was already dark. The comrades all told me to rest for a day before working, but how could I? I pestered the director for a long time, and he agreed to let me work in the seismograph group, so I went there that evening.

The seismograph group is rushing to produce portable seismographs. These things are used for treasure hunting. Grandpa often says there are treasures in the gullies northwest of our village. If we have this thing, we can find out if it's true or not. We didn't know how to make this before; we had to rely on imported goods. Imported goods are expensive, bulky, and fragile. We had to haul them around in trucks all day long, and we couldn't use them in places where transportation was inconvenient. The one we're making now is small, sturdy, and durable. Two or three people can carry it. That's why it's called a portable seismograph.

The leadership assigned me the task of making a batch of small mirrors for the instruments. They automatically record the instrument's working status. The mirrors are only the size of rice grains; you could blow them away with a breath. We had asked other units to make them, but some of the ones they made were unusable, and some didn't have the time to make them. The field urgently needs the instruments, so we have to hurry up and make them ourselves.

I've never done this kind of thing before. It's like when I first arrived in the village, I couldn't even tell the difference between rice seedlings and weeds. If I don't know how, I'll learn. There's no other way. I got some books from the group leader and learned from some of the veteran comrades. I read the books and pondered. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to use a chemical method to silver-plate the glass. The chemical method is simple and convenient. Let's try it out first.

When preparing the materials, I rummaged through the room and found that I didn't even have a bottle to mix the chemicals. The supply department doesn't work at night, so I had to go to the section chief's house to find one. Everyone at the section chief's house was asleep. I knocked on the door for a long time before the section chief came to open it in his cotton-padded coat. He immediately wrote a note and told me to go to the administrator, Little Du. I took the note and went to find Little Du. Together, Little Du and I pieced together the medicine in the warehouse. By the time we were walking back, the early morning stars were already leaning to the west.

When I got back to the room, I hurried to mix the chemicals. The group leader also ran over to help. The first batch I mixed was dark and murky. It wouldn't stick to anything when I tried to plate it. The group leader helped me mix the chemicals carefully again, and the second time it plated. The light wasn't very bright, but at least I found a way.

The mirrors I'm plating right now aren't very good yet. Each plating wastes a lot of chemicals. I have to carefully check the reason. I remember one time when I went up the mountain with Grandpa to chop firewood. When we came down the mountain, Grandpa said he had dropped something on the mountain. When you angrily returned, I saw that you had picked up a two or three-foot-long piece of hemp rope. You said it belonged to the commune, and we couldn't waste even a little bit of public property. I still remember that clearly.

Now we can't work together anymore. But Grandpa is still right: "Wherever you go, you're working for socialism!" That's the way it is. No matter how far apart we are, we're still walking the same path.

I wish the whole family well!

### 寄回长陵园村的信

    寄回长陵园村的信大爷大妈：
    离开你们才两三天，可是这两三天多不好过呀！无论工作或休息的时候，心里总像空荡荡的。长陵园村就是我的家，离开时，真感到难舍难分。
    临走时害怕二平头哭哭闹闹，就没告诉他，正巧他上学去了，下学后他闹没有？要是闹就说老冀哥到元旦就回村里看他，一定要带给他有毛主席像的小人书。
    回到学校，天已经黑了。同志们都说让我歇一天再工作，这怎么成呢？我跟主任缠了半天，他答应让我到地震组工作，当晚我就去了。
    地震组正在赶制轻便地震仪，这东西是探宝用的。大爷常说咱村西北的沟崖上有宝，要是有了这东西就能探清真有还是假有。这东西以前我们不会做，得靠进口货。进口货价钱贵，又笨重又娇嫩，整天得用汽车拉着，交通不方便的地方就不能用。现在我们做的这个又小巧又耐用，两三个人抬起来就走。所以起名叫轻便地震仪。
    领导上分给我的工作是做一批仪器里用的小镜子，它能把仪器的工作情况自动记录下来，镜子只有米粒那么大，哈口气就吹不见了。曾托别的单位做，有些做出来的不能用，有些没有工夫做，野外又急着用仪器，只有自己赶快动手做。
    这玩艺儿我以前没干过，像初到村里那一阵，连谷苗跟草都分不清一样。不会就学，没有别的办法。我从组长那儿找了几本书，又领教了几个老同志，就边看书边琢磨起来。琢磨了一阵，我就决定用化学方法往玻璃上镀银，化学法简单省事，先试试看吧。
    准备东西时，我把屋里翻了个遍，发现连配药的瓶子都没有，供应科晚上也是不办公，我就只好到科长家里去找。科长家里都睡了，敲了半天门，科长才披着棉袄来开门。他马上给写了便条，让去找管理员小杜。我又拿着条子去找小杜，跟小杜一起到库房七拼八凑地弄好药，往回走时，三星已经偏西了。
    回到屋里后，就赶忙配药，组长也跑过来帮忙。第一次配出来的黑糊糊的，往上镀时连粘都不粘。组长帮我仔细地又配了遍药，第二次就镀上了，光还不大亮，但总算有了门路。
    眼下镀出来的镜子还不大好，镀一次就得费去不少药，这得好好检查原因。记得有一次，我跟大爷一起上山砍柴，下了山时大爷说掉了东西在山上，等您气呼呼返回来时，我看见原来是检回来一骨节二三尺长的麻绳。您说这是社里的，公家的东西一丁点也不能糟蹋。这件事到现在我还记得清清楚楚。
    现在我们不能在一起劳动了。但是还是大爷说得对：“到哪里也是为社会主义干活！”事实也是这样，无论我们隔着千山万水，我们还是走在一条道上。
    祝全家人好！
