To adapt to the needs of commune development, production improvement, and life enhancement, Henan comprehensively rectifies financial work. Guangdong's Xinhui communes use funds according to urgency.

(By our newspaper) Henan Province convened a People's Commune financial work conference in early December to review and summarize the achievements and experiences in financial work since communization, and studied ways to improve commune financial work this winter and next spring.

How to make commune financial work adapt in all aspects to the characteristics of the commune's large scale, wide business scope, many income and expenditure items, and the integration of national finance and commune finance, and to adapt to the commune's production and life needs, is an important issue in promoting the consolidation and development of the people's communes. Since the realization of communization in Henan Province, the rural grassroots financial system and the establishment of institutions have been reformed, a financial revenue and expenditure contract system has been implemented, and the state's financial revenue tasks have been completed. The vast majority of communes in the province have also established simple and easy-to-implement systems for financial planning management, democratic management, property management, fund management, and accounting. In conjunction with production, financial clearing work was carried out, the commune's property was initially clarified, and the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune was further implemented. Financial work has gradually moved from the chaos of the early days of the commune's establishment to a more standardized state. In order to ensure the needs of commune production and the payment of commune members' wages, many regions have vigorously developed diversified economic production, increasing commune income. Twenty-eight counties in the province have reached an income of 10 million yuan after developing diversified economic production; 177 communes have achieved an increase in income of 1 million yuan; and more than 80% to 85% of communes can guarantee the timely payment of wages, which has played a good role in consolidating the communes.

However, because the communes were established not long ago, there is still not enough experience in managing commune finances, and it is not yet clear how to correctly handle the relationship between the state and the commune, the commune and its members, the development of social commodity production, and allocation relationships. Some comrades still have the idea of ​​"a big family and a big business", and some phenomena of extravagance and waste have appeared. The financial management system is not sound enough. These problems will affect the commune's production and the arrangement of members' lives, and affect the consolidation and development of the commune. In order to solve these problems, in addition to exchanging experiences of good financial management work in various places, the meeting also determined that the following aspects must be grasped in commune financial work this winter and next spring:

First, it is necessary to vigorously organize and develop diversified economic production and increase commune income. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the financial departments of each commune must strengthen cooperation with economic departments such as industry, agriculture, commerce, and finance, mobilize the masses, open up production avenues, and actively organize the production of diversified economies. The province guarantees that by the end of May next year, the net income of commodity production in people's communes will reach 1.7 billion yuan, and according to the total population, it is required that each person increases income by 3 to 6 yuan per month.

Secondly, care about the masses' lives and welfare, do a good job in the commune's income distribution, ensure the timely payment of commune members' wages, and actively run various collective welfare undertakings. According to the different characteristics of various productions, reasonably adjust the wage levels, and appropriately increase the proportion of commune members' wages. It is imperative to ensure that commune members eat well, dress well, and live well, and ensure that commune members have a good Spring Festival.

Third, resolutely implement the whole Party and the whole people in running finance, and realize democratic management of financial work. All financial revenue and expenditure plans and management systems of the commune must be established on the basis of mass formulation, mass supervision, mass execution, and mass summary. The budget and final accounts of revenue and expenditure, the distribution of income, and major financial revenue and expenditure matters must be launched by the members for discussion and implemented after being passed by the members' congress or representative meeting. Various accounts should be announced to the members regularly, and various forms should be used to make everyone understand finance and supervise finance.

Fourth, strengthen financial construction, and gradually establish a complete set of new financial systems adapted to communization. And according to the spirit of unified leadership, hierarchical management, unified but not rigid, and decentralized but not chaotic, appropriately adjust the management authority between the commune, brigade, and production team, and give play to the enthusiasm of all levels in managing finance. (Fang Huang)

(By our newspaper) The people's communes in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, have recently rectified their financial management work. Because they have clarified their assets, diversified operations and sideline production have been greatly developed.

There are thirteen communes in Xinhui County. Initially, many commune cadres unilaterally believed that the commune was large, and the late rice harvest was a bumper one, so there would be no problem with production funds and wage expenditures. Because the communes did not establish a complete set of financial management systems and prepare good financial plans, there was also chaos in the use of funds regardless of priority, as well as turning public funds into small public funds and indiscriminate spending.

The Xinhui County Party Committee began to rectify the financial management of the communes in mid-November. The first step was to find out the commune's assets. Although the great leap forward in production this year made the newly established communes have considerable financial strength, the investment required by each commune to expand production and carry out basic construction was very large; and the implementation of the partial wage and partial supply system also required a large amount of funds every month; in addition, it was also necessary to repay a number of national loans. After such careful calculation, the communes initially clarified their assets, and some communes had a financial deficit of more than 1 million yuan in the month with the largest deficit. This sobered up the minds of many commune cadres, who realized that in order to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward next year, it is necessary to prepare good financial plans and establish good financial management systems, implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune, open up sources of income and reduce expenditures in many ways, and achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure every quarter and every month, and strive for income to exceed expenditure.

When preparing financial plans, the communes first debated among cadres and the masses, unified their understanding, and made it clear that it is necessary to plan the use of funds based on the principle of first satisfying production needs, and use most of the funds in industry and agriculture, and in developing diversified operations, to ensure the rapid growth of the commune's economy. On the basis of clarifying the principles for the use of funds, grasp the seasonal characteristics, rank the expenditure items according to priority and urgency, reasonably arrange funds, and compile a financial plan. In terms of establishing financial management systems, the communes stipulated that all products of production units such as brigades, factories, and farms should be planned and allocated uniformly by the supply and marketing departments, blocking loopholes such as turning public funds into small public funds and hoarding and waste. At the same time, financial contracting and independent accounting were also implemented in each unit, so that they could manage revenue and expenditure and give play to their enthusiasm for diligence and thrift in running the commune.

The communes in Xinhui County have prepared financial plans and established financial management systems. Cadres and the masses clearly realized that to realize the fund planning, it is necessary to quickly develop diversified operations and sideline production, and combine long-term and short-term production, in order to overcome the difficulties of seasonal financial constraints. Therefore, on the one hand, the communes concentrated their main force on deep plowing, soil improvement, and winter planting; on the other hand, they organized professional teams and shock forces, adapted to local conditions, and used local materials to vigorously engage in diversified operations and sideline production. The Gujing Commune mobilized the masses to find out that there are seven major ways and more than 70 items of diversified operations and sideline production, including "digging," "planting," "raising," "picking," "fishing," "making," and "collecting." The increased income in eight days was more than 290,000 yuan. In the past 20 days, the communes in the county have developed diversified operations and sideline production, increasing income by more than 5 million yuan. It is estimated that before the busy spring plowing, the total increase in income can be more than 15 million yuan, which is enough to initially solve the commune's funding needs for the current and the next March, April, and May. (Yang Weiqun)

(By our newspaper) In the process of strengthening the leadership of financial work, the Tangshi People's Commune Party Committee in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, fully mobilized the masses and achieved democratic management. The commune has established a financial management committee, and the brigade and team have democratic supervision posts, and the members of the organization are elected by the members. Their responsibilities are: to clear the accounts, review the expenditures, and check the accuracy of the figures. They have the right to review the accounts and the right to verify the expenditures. For all financial expenditures, there is a budget in advance and reimbursement afterwards. The commune's basic construction is to first discuss the plan with the masses. The method is to explain to the members by the cadre enlarged meeting and the democratic management organization. Each company's democratic management organization (composed of three to five people according to the company's size) is attended by two-thirds of the members and one-third of the cadres. Each company has a financial disclosure column. The commune stipulates that the financial expenditure from the company to the commune should be cleared daily and settled monthly. Financial expenditure and canteen and other affairs management have registration cards, and each member has the right to supervise the finance. The commune's financial plan is also adopted by issuing announcements, big-character posters, and oral announcements. The commune's financial staff often go down the road to check the financial accounts of the camp and company, and solicit the opinions of the masses. In this way, the accounts often meet with the masses, and the members are all satisfied. (Zhang Zhisheng)

    适应公社发展生产改善生活的需要  
    河南全面整顿财务工作
    广东新会各公社分别缓急使用资金
    本报讯  河南省在12月上旬召开了人民公社财务工作会议，检查和总结了公社化以来，在财务工作方面取得的成绩和经验，研究了今冬明春做好公社财务工作的办法。
    如何使公社财务工作从各方面适应公社的规模大、经营范围广、收支项目多和国家财政和公社财务合一的特点，适应公社的生产和生活的需要，是当前促进人民公社巩固和发展的一个重要问题。河南省实现公社化以来，改革了农村基层财政体制和机构的设置，实行了财政收支包干，完成了国家的财政收入任务。全省绝大部分公社还建立了财务计划管理、民主管理、财产管理、资金管理、会计核算等等简便易行的制度。结合生产，开展了财务清理工作，初步澄清了公社的财产，进一步贯彻了勤俭办社的方针。财务工作已经由公社成立初期的混乱，逐步走上正规。不少地区为了保证公社生产的需要，保证社员工资的发放，大力开展多种经济生产，增加了公社收入。全省有二十八个县在发展多种经济生产后，收入达到千万元；一百七十七个公社实现了增加收入百万元；80％至85％以上的公社，都能保证工资的按时发放，对巩固公社起到了良好的作用。
    但是由于公社建立不久，管理公社财务的经验还很不够，对如何正确处理国家与公社，公社与社员的关系，发展社会商品生产和调拨关系，都还不很明确，部分同志还存在有家大业大思想，出现一些铺张浪费的现象。在财务管理制度上还不够健全。这些问题都会影响公社的生产和社员生活的安排，影响到公社的巩固和发展。为了解决这些问题，会上除交流了各地做得好的财务管理工作的经验外，还确定了今冬明春公社财务工作必须抓好以下几个方面：
    首先是要大力组织与发展多种经济生产，增加公社收入。各个公社的财务部门必须在党的统一领导下，加强和工、农、商、金等各经济部门的协作，发动群众，广开生产门路，积极组织多种经济的生产。全省保证到明年5月底止，人民公社商品生产的纯收入要达到十七亿元，按总人口计算，要求每人每月增加收入三元到六元。
    其次，是关心群众生活福利，作好公社的收入分配，保证社员工资及时发放，积极办好各项集体福利事业。根据各种生产的不同特点，合理的调整工资级别，并且要适当的扩大社员工资比例。一定要保证社员吃好、穿好、住好，保证社员过好春节。
    第三，坚决贯彻全党全民办财务，实现财务工作民主管理。对于公社的一切财务收支计划和管理制度，都必须建立在群众制定、群众监督、群众执行、群众总结的基础上。收支预决算、收入的分配，重大财务的收支事项，都必须发动社员讨论，经过社员代表大会或代表会议通过执行。各项账目要定期向社员公布，要运用多种形式，使人人懂得财务、人人监督财务。
  第四，加强财务建设，逐步建立一套完整的适应公社化后新的财务制度。并且根据统一领导分级管理，统而不死、放而不乱的精神，适当调整公社、大队、生产队之间的管理权限，发挥各级管理财务的积极性。（方徨）
    本报讯  广东省新会县各人民公社，最近整顿了财务管理工作。因为摸清了家底，多种经营和副业生产得到了很大的发展。
    新会县有十三个公社。最初，许多社干部大都片面认为，公社很大，晚稻又大丰收，生产资金和工资等开支都不成问题。各社因没有建立成套的财务管理制度和编制好财务计划，也出现了使用资金不分主次缓急，以及化大公为小公和乱支乱用的混乱现象。
    中共新会县委在11月中旬开始整顿公社的财务管理。首先是摸清公社的家底。今年生产大跃进虽然使初建立的公社拥有相当雄厚的资金，但各公社扩大生产和进行基本建设所需投资量很大；而分配上实行部分工资部分供给制度每月也需要大量资金；另外，还要清还国家若干贷款。经过这样精细核计后，公社都初步摸清了家底，而有的公社财政差额最多的1月份就缺资金一百多万元。这使许多公社干部的头脑清醒过来，认识到为了实现明年更大更全面的跃进，必须编制好财务计划和建立好财务管理制度，贯彻勤俭办社方针，多方开源节流，作到每季度每月份收支平衡，并争取收入超过支出。
    各公社编制财务计划时，首先在干部和群众中辩论，统一认识，明确必须本着先满足生产需要的原则，来规划使用资金，把大部分资金用在工农业并举和开展多种经营方面，以保证公社经济迅速增长。在明确资金使用原则的基础上掌握季节特点，把支出项目分别主次缓急排队，合理安排资金，编成财务计划。各公社在建立财务管理制度方面，规定大队、厂、场等生产单位，所有产品都由供销部门统一计划调拨，堵塞了化大公为小公和积压浪费等漏洞。同时，还在各单位实行财务包干、独立核算，使他们做到管收管支，发挥勤俭办社的积极性。
    新会县各公社编制了财务计划，建立了财务管理制度，干部和群众明确认识要实现资金规划必须迅速开展多种经营和副业生产，使长期短期生产结合，才能克服季节性的财力不足的困难。因此，各公社一方面集中主力进行深耕改土和冬种；一方面组织专业队伍和突击力量，因地制宜，就地取材，大搞多种经营和副业生产。古井公社发动群众查出多种经营和副业生产有“挖”、“植”、“养”、“采”、“捕”、“制”、“收”等七大门路七十多项，八天增加的收入就有二十九万多元。全县的公社近二十天来开展多种经营和副业生产增加收入五百多万元。预计到春耕大忙之前，总共可增加收入一千五百多万元以上，这个数字就足可初步解决当前和明年3、4、5月份公社资金的需要。  （杨伟群）
    本报讯  湖南省永兴县塘市人民公社党委会在加强财务工作领导的过程中，充分发动群众，做到了民主管理。公社设立了财务管理委员会，大队和小队有民主监督岗，组织成员由社员选举出来。他们的责任是：清理账目，审查开支，检查数字准确性。他们有权审查账目，有权核销开支。凡是财务开支，事前有预算，事后有报销。社里的基本建设，是先把计划通过群众讨论。方法是由干部扩大会和民主管理组织向社员讲解。每个连的民主管理组织（按连大小三人到五人组成）有三分之二的社员和三分之一的干部参加。每个连都设有财经公开栏。公社规定从连到公社的财务开支，做到日清月结。财务开支和食堂等事务管理都有登记卡片，每个社员都有对财务进行监督的权利。公社的财务计划也是采用出榜公布、大字报、口头公布的办法。公社财经人员，经常分途下去检查营、连的财务账目，征求群众的意见。这样，账目经常与群众见面，社员个个点头满意。（张芷生）
