According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, in order to better serve heavy industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, people's lives, and exports, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will, next year, under the premise of taking steel as the key link, rely on the leadership of the Party, face the people's communes, and develop light industry at high speed. This was the task determined at the recent meeting of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Light Industry Bureau.

This year, the entire Party and all the people have vigorously developed industry, greatly promoting the development of light industry. As of the end of November, more than 100,000 new light industrial factories have been built in various townships and communes throughout the region. The total output value of light industry in the region this year is expected to increase by 155% compared with 1957; the output of major products has mostly overfulfilled the national plan, with a large increase compared with last year, such as heavy leather increasing by 36%, paper increasing by 97%, and dairy products increasing by 157%. In the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the workers breaking down superstitions and working practically and cleverly, the region has successfully trial-produced many new products, including products that previously relied on imports or were entirely adjusted from outside the region, such as clocks, bicycles, and cameras, some of which have been mass-produced.

In order to correctly implement the development policy of light industry and complete and overfulfill the 1959 Great Leap Forward plan, this light industry bureau director meeting criticized the erroneous ideas that light industry can only give way and specialize in "foreign gadgets," and clearly recognized that light industry must walk on two legs. The meeting required light industry authorities in various leagues and cities to put politics in command, promote the spirit of communist collaboration, and help various banners and counties to vigorously develop commune industry in the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, and using local materials for local processing. While vigorously developing commune industry, it is also necessary to rectify, consolidate, and improve the factories that have already been developed.

According to the Tianjin Daily, the Tianjin Municipal Light Industry Bureau held a factory director meeting on the 6th of this month to make arrangements for the production plan and raw material supply in the first quarter of next year; on the 13th, it held another conference to mobilize light industrial workers throughout the city to seize the time, grasp the opportunity, vigorously carry out technical revolution, vigorously carry out raw material production and scientific research, and strive to complete this year's Great Leap Forward plan while fully preparing for next year's production.

Next year will be a crucial year for Tianjin to transform the face of light industry through three years of hard work. In order to meet the needs of urban and rural areas and exports, Tianjin's light industry must achieve a more comprehensive, faster, and more effective Great Leap Forward in production and technology next year than this year. The Tianjin Municipal Light Industry Bureau put forward specific tasks: the number of new products trial-produced and produced throughout the year next year should double that of this year, reaching more than 2,000, including the mass production of high-quality, sophisticated, large, and cutting-edge products, so that high-quality, sophisticated, and large products account for 40% of the planned products in the bureau; the level of mechanization, automation, and continuous production in various factories should be greatly improved compared to this year; three hundred and eighteen scientific research projects should be completed, and efforts should be made to break through one thousand; in terms of product quality, major products should reach the advanced domestic level, and high-quality, sophisticated, and large products put into production should reach the international level.

At present, many light industrial factories in the city are widely mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan for the first quarter of next year. Some factories have already begun to solve the problems of insufficient raw materials and equipment.

    让明年生活更比今年好
    内蒙古天津安排加速发展轻工业
    据内蒙古日报消息  为了更好地为大工业、农牧业、人民生活及出口服务，内蒙古自治区明年将在以钢为纲的前提下，依靠党的领导，面向人民公社，高速度发展轻工业。这是最近内蒙古自治区轻工业局长会议上确定的任务。
    今年全党全民大办工业，大大促进了轻工业的发展。截至11月底，全区各乡、社已新建轻工业工厂十万多座。今年全区轻工业总产值预计比1957年增长155％；主要产品的产量大都超额完成了国家计划，比去年有很大增长，如重革增长36％，纸增长97％，乳制品增长157％。在大跃进中，由于职工破除迷信，实干、巧干，全区试制成功了许多种新产品，其中有过去依靠进口或完全由区外调剂的产品，如钟表、自行车、照像机等，有的并已大批生产。
    为了正确贯彻轻工业发展方针，完成和超额完成1959年跃进计划，这次轻工业局长会议批判了轻工业只能停车让路和专搞“大洋群”等错误思想，明确认识到轻工业必须两条腿走路。会议要求各盟市轻工业主管部门必须政治挂帅，发扬共产主义协作精神，本着土洋结合，综合利用，多种经营，就地取材就地加工的精神，帮助各旗县大办公社工业。在大量发展公社工业的同时，也要对已发展起来的工厂进行整顿巩固和提高。
    据天津日报消息  天津市轻工业局在本月6日召开厂长会议，就明年第一季度生产计划和原材料供应问题做了安排；13日又召开大会，发动全市轻工业职工，争取时间，抓紧时机，大搞技术革命，大搞原材料生产和科学研究，在力争完成今年跃进计划的同时，全面地为明年生产作好准备工作。
    明年是天津市苦战三年改变轻工业面貌的关键年。为了满足城乡和出口需要，天津市轻工业明年要在生产上、技术上来一个比今年规模更大、速度更快、成效更高的全面大跃进。天津市轻工业局提出了具体的任务：明年全年试制和生产的新产品要比今年翻一番，达到二千多种，其中大量生产高、精、大、尖的产品，使高、精、大产品在全局有计划的产品中达到40％；各厂机械化、自动化、连续化的水平要比今年有很大提高；要完成三百一十八项科学研究项目，力争突破一千项；在产品质量方面，主要产品要达到国内先进水平，投入生产的高、精、大产品要达到国际水平。
    目前，全市不少轻工业工厂，正在广泛发动群众，讨论明年第一季度的计划。有些厂已经着手解决原料、设备不足的问题。
