    Enrich the Lives of Commune Members
    Pixian Retains and Improves Market Town Restaurants, Taverns, and Teahouses
    (People's Daily, Chengdu, December 30th, reporters Yu Jingqi and Liu Zongtang) Pixian County, Sichuan Province, while operating public canteens well, has adopted a "four retentions" approach, retaining the pots and stoves in farmers' homes, the restaurants and taverns in rural market towns, the teahouses, and various workshops, and actively adjusting, improving, and developing them to meet the diverse needs of commune members and enrich people's lives.
    Pixian County achieved public canteenization in October, with all of the county's more than 40,000 farm households eating in public canteens. The Pixian County Party Committee, considering that simply operating public canteens would still not address people's various hobbies and customs, instructed all county communes to implement "four retentions" from the beginning of establishing canteens: retaining the pots and stoves in farmers' homes, allowing farmers to cook whatever they want at home while participating in collective canteens; retaining restaurants and taverns; retaining teahouses; and retaining various workshops such as sauce gardens, flour mills, and tofu workshops.
    In order to better adapt the "four retentions" to the current needs of rural areas, the people's communes, under the leadership of the county party committee, carried out a series of adjustments, improvements, and development work. According to incomplete statistics, the county has recently built and expanded more than forty sauce gardens, wineries, confectionery factories, and flour mills. In the past, the county had only one winery, and most of the wine was imported from other places. Now, more than twenty new wineries (workshops) have been built throughout the county, producing 150,000 jin per month, which is more than enough for self-sufficiency. Among them, the famous Pixian wine, Pitong Wine, which had ceased production for more than twenty years, has also resumed production. Spicy broad bean paste is the most popular non-staple food among local farmers, and the number of varieties has now increased from one or two to five or six. Restaurants, taverns, and snack shops in various market towns have also increased the variety of their offerings. At the same time, a large number of mobile service teams have been organized to supply liquor, side dishes, and pastries to public canteens. In terms of teahouses, many places have planned to extend them to the vicinity of commune canteens to facilitate farmers' tea drinking. Some have also added books and pictorials to the teahouses and organized cultural performances, turning them into rural "cultural paradises." The implementation of the "four retentions" has effectively compensated for the shortcomings of public canteens, enriched people's material and cultural lives, and is therefore deeply welcomed by farmers.
    Because various workshops supply a large number of non-staple foods, public canteens in various communes have diversified their dishes, and now most canteens offer three dishes and one soup. In addition, in the public canteens, you can see many commune members bringing their own side dishes, eating with relish. During festivals, holidays, or market days, farmers can buy their favorite cheap and delicious snacks and side dishes. Every market day, the snack shops are packed, filled with joy. Commune members reflect that life is getting better and better, and the enthusiasm for production is also getting higher and higher.

    让社员生活丰富多彩
    郫县保留和提高集镇饭馆酒馆茶馆
    本报成都30日电  记者于竞祁、刘宗棠报道：四川省郫县各人民公社在办好公共食堂同时，采取“四保留”的办法，把农民家中锅灶、农村场镇中的饭馆酒馆、茶馆和各种作坊保留下来，并积极加以调整、提高和发展，多方面满足社员的需要，使人们生活丰富多彩。
    郫县在10月份已经实现了公共食堂化，全县四万多户农民全部在公共食堂用饭。中共郫县县委考虑到单是办好公共食堂仍然不能解决人民各种不同的爱好和习俗，因而从开始建立食堂时，就同时指示全县公社实行“四保留”，即保留农民家中的锅灶，允许农民在参加集体食堂的同时，也可以在家随意做点想吃的东西；保留饭馆酒馆；保留茶馆；保留酱园、粉坊、豆腐坊等各种作坊。
    为了使“四保留”能更好地适应当前农村需要，各人民公社在县委领导下进行了一系列的调整、提高和发展工作。据不完全统计，全县最近新建和扩建的酱园、酒厂、糖果糕点厂以及粉坊等厂坊有四十多个。过去全县只有一个酒厂，大部用酒是依靠外地调进。现在全县新建了二十多个酒厂（坊），每月生产十五万斤，自给有余。其中已经停止生产二十多年的名酒郫筒酒也恢复生产。辣豆瓣是当地农民最喜爱的副食品，现在已由过去的一两种增加到五、六种。各场镇上的饭馆、酒馆、小吃店等，也都增加花色品种；同时还组织了大量的流动服务组，到各公共食堂供应零酒、小菜和糕点。茶馆方面，许多地方有计划地下伸到公社食堂附近，便利农民喝茶。有的还在茶馆中添置了图书画报，组织文娱演出，变成了农村的“文化乐园”。“四保留”的实行，有效地弥补了公共食堂不足之处，丰富了人们的物质文化生活，因而深受农民的欢迎。
    各社公共食堂由于各种作坊供应了大量副食品，菜饭做到多样化，现在一般食堂都是三菜一汤。另外在公共食堂里，可以看到许多社员都带有自己做的小菜，吃得津津有味。每逢节日、假期或是赶场天，农民可以买到自己喜爱的价廉物美的小吃、小菜。每到场期，各个小吃店里都是座无虚席，一片欢乐。社员们反映说：日子愈过愈好，生产的劲头也愈来愈大了。
