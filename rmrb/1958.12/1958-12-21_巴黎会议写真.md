The North Atlantic Treaty Organization council meets every year, but this year's meeting was the most exciting. They argued for three days and resolved nothing, because everyone had ulterior motives. To show "unity" and "friendship," the bigwigs took a group photo together, but no matter how they pretended, they couldn't hide the unease in everyone's hearts.

	The United States' Dulles put on a "lord" face: "I have plenty of money, I want you to send more people to die for me and put rockets in your homes."

	Britain's Lloyd was worried, hoping that the "Common Market" would fail. Last year, he barely became the United States' watchdog, but he can't let France and West Germany gain the upper hand.

	France's Couve de Murville couldn't quite hold his head up, the taste of being a poor relative is really bad. "Huh! You look down on me, but I won't give up demanding a share of the leadership!"

	West Germany's Brentano secretly calculated: "West Berlin must be firmly grasped and not let go," and he also wants to squeeze into the leadership group and greatly expand his own power.

The internal contradictions within the imperialist camp are numerous, and they are all choking each other without letting go. After a big argument, no one's goals were achieved, and the meeting had to end!

The socialist camp shines brightly, and the anti-colonialist movement is like a raging storm. The Western bosses barely took a photo together this year, but who knows what will happen next year! (Attached photo)

    巴黎会议写真
    何万北大西洋集团理事会年年开，今年的会议最精彩，吵了三天什么也没解决，因为各人都怀着鬼胎。为了表示“团结”和“友情”大人先生们在一起拍了个合影，不管他们怎样装模作样，也掩盖不住大家心里的不宁。美国的杜勒斯摆出一付“盟主”的脸，
  “老子有的是钱，要你们多多的出人替我卖命还要在你们的家里安置火箭。”英国的劳埃德忧心忡忡，只盼“共同市场”搞不成功，去年好容易当上了美国的看门狗，可不能让法国和西德再占上风。法国的德姆维尔有点抬不起头，穷亲戚的滋味真不好受，“嗯！你们把我看不上眼，我可不放弃分享领导权的要求！”西德的勃伦塔诺暗中盘算：
  “西柏林要牢牢抓住不能放，”还要挤进领导集团，把自己的势力大大扩张。帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，互相卡住脖子都不放松，嚷了一场谁的目的也没达到，会议只好就此告终！社会主义阵营光芒万丈，反殖民主义的运动有如狂风巨浪，西方几个头目今年还勉强在一起照相，明年可不知怎么样！（附图片）
