    Careful Grazing, High Yield Harvest
    The CPC Qinghai Guide County Committee
    The pasture of the Changmu People's Commune's Animal Husbandry Brigade in Guide County is located on the alpine grasslands south of the Yellow River, a high-altitude, cold region with drastic climate changes and a long dry season. The entire brigade consists of Tibetan herdsmen, primarily engaged in animal husbandry. This brigade's Fifth Team, in March of this year, selected 350 ewes of appropriate age and established a high-yield sheep experimental field. Under the leadership of the Party and with the active support of the commune members, the herdsmen carefully managed the sheep and finally achieved a high yield. This flock of sheep produced lambs twice in the fifteen months from August 1957 to November 1958. The first lambing produced 365 lambs, with 364 surviving, including 15 pairs of twins. The second lambing produced 354 lambs, with 353 surviving, including 4 pairs of twins. The total number of lambs produced in the two lambings was 719, with 717 surviving. The main experiences in achieving this great success are:

    I. Party committee leadership, with the secretary taking the lead in carrying out socialist and communist education movements: The Changmu Brigade Party Committee began organizing the high-yield sheep experimental group during the pastoral cooperation. However, at that time, many cadres and masses had doubts about the brigade party committee's leap forward plan for sheep to "produce two litters a year or three litters in two years, doubling the output in three years," and lacked confidence. In response to these ideological situations, the brigade party committee, led by the first secretary, held four meetings, combined with the grievance-airing movement, to carry out socialist and communist education. Adhering to the spirit of being both practical and idealistic, and combining the two, they promptly launched a "speaking out and debate" campaign to criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, and study specific measures to achieve high sheep production. They forcefully criticized the right-leaning views of those who advocated "the theory of conditions determine everything" and "the theory of backward pastoral areas," thereby boosting morale and strengthening confidence in the Great Leap Forward. After the high-yield sheep experimental group was formed and consolidated, the party committee promptly convened on-site meetings according to different production seasons, and carried out production emulation campaigns for lambing and raising lambs, grass cutting and storage, and the establishment of feed bases, holding more than ten appraisals, which powerfully promoted the development of production.

    II. Herdsmen have become true masters: This year, through the anti-feudal struggle, the broad masses of herdsmen received a profound class education, recognized the development prospects of the two roads, greatly raised their class consciousness, and brought into play the enthusiasm of the working herdsmen as masters of their own affairs, resulting in touching examples of loving the commune as their home and loving livestock as their children. Jue Le, a herdsman in the experimental sheep flock, believed that "the sun of happiness has shone on my door, and I can't get over it if I don't graze the sheep well," so he was not afraid of fatigue, carefully grazing the sheep during the day and guarding the flock at night. The 364 spring lambs he grazed are all well-developed, physically strong, and 73 ewes have already shown signs of estrus and have been bred. In order to ensure that the livestock are well-fed and guarantee high yields, at the suggestion of the herdsmen, a three-shift grazing system was established, extending the grazing time from the original eight hours to thirteen hours. The first shift starts at dawn and is replaced by the second shift at breakfast time, the third shift at noon, and the sheep are driven back after the stars come out in the afternoon. This ensures that grazing is not delayed due to the herdsmen's meals, and that sheep are not lost due to lack of supervision, ensuring that the sheep are physically strong.

    III. Grazing according to time and place, so that the sheep eat their fill and eat well, and drink enough water: In order to ensure that livestock have enough grass to eat all year round, on the basis of seasonal rotation grazing, a zoned and segmented rotation grazing system was further implemented, selecting pastures with good grass, sufficient water, and grass that sheep love to graze. And according to the different conditions of each season, adopt the practice of grazing in high mountains and distant mountains in summer to avoid heat and mosquito harassment in the plains; grazing flowering grasses and frost-resistant grasses in autumn, and avoiding grazing in the low-lying meadows to prevent infection with liver fluke disease and foot rot caused by humidity; grazing in wind-sheltered and sunny areas in mountain gullies and plains in winter and spring, and after the green grass sprouts, eat the yellow grass first and then the green grass to avoid overeating causing sheep enterotoxemia. In spring, summer and autumn, drink water two or three times a day, and once in winter, to prevent insufficient or excessive drinking from affecting weight gain and maintenance.

    IV. Increase the number of rams to achieve full breeding and pregnancy: During the breeding season this year, according to the experience of the old herdsmen, the number of rams was increased in a ratio of one to thirteen to increase the number of matings and eliminate barrenness.

    V. Prevent abortion, carefully lambing and raising young: In order to prevent abortion, during the ewe's pregnancy, avoid grazing in pastures on high mountains and steep slopes, do not let the ewes eat frosted grass, change the morning and evening drinking water to noon drinking water, ensure that the sheepfolds are spacious and comfortable, and that the entrance and exit doors are not crowded, ensuring safe production for both pregnancies. During the lambing period, ensure that they do not leave the flock during the day and do not leave the fold at night, and take turns guarding. Each person is also equipped with a lambing bag, which is disinfected with grass ash every time a lamb is placed in it to prevent the spread of disease and the phenomenon of ewes not recognizing their lambs.

    VI. Establish a feeding base and supplement feeding in a timely manner: This team reclaimed 836 mu of wasteland this year, planted 113 mu of green oats, harvested 148,950 jin of oat grass, and stored 743,450 jin of green hay, which not only ensured the supplementary green grass for the experimental sheep flock, but also supplied supplementary feeding for other flocks, realizing evergreen throughout the four seasons and overwintering with full weight. Starting from November, each sheep in the experimental flock was supplemented with one jin of green hay per day until the green grass sprouts. In order to prevent the sheep from crowding and trampling and wasting green hay, the "hanging grass supplementary feeding method" was adopted.

    VII. Minor illnesses do not leave the flock, major illnesses do not leave the team: In order to strengthen veterinary epidemic prevention work, under the specific leadership of the party committee, the entire team selected 25 young men and women to organize a veterinary platoon, using the method of master teaching apprentice, learning and working at the same time, to train technical forces, so that each flock has herdsmen who understand general veterinary techniques, conscientiously implement the principle of "prevention is more important than treatment," and timely carry out preventive injections of sheep pox, anthrax, and sheep enterotoxemia. It is generally achieved that minor illnesses do not leave the flock and major illnesses do not leave the team.

    In order to launch a greater leap forward in animal husbandry production next year, the county party committee decided to assign special personnel to inspect and assist in strengthening leadership. At present, in addition to doing a good job in overwintering and protecting livestock, they are doing everything possible to enhance the physical fitness of livestock, so as to achieve breeding with production, and strive to produce a litter in April next year and another litter in winter.

    精心放牧  高额丰收
    中共青海贵德县委会
    贵德人民公社常牧大队的牧场位于黄河以南的高山草原上，地处高寒，气候变化剧烈，枯草期较长。全队都是藏族牧民，以经营畜牧业为主。这个队的第五小队，在今年3月选择了三百五十只适龄母绵羊，建立了绵羊丰产试验田。在党的领导和社员的积极支持下，牧工精心管理，终于获得了高额丰产。这群羊在1957年8月至1958年11月的十五个月内，先后产羔两次。第一次产羔三百六十五只，成活三百六十四只，内一胎双羔的十五只；第二次产羔三百五十四只，成活三百五十三只，内一胎双羔的四只。两次共产羔七百一十九只，成活七百一十七只。取得这个巨大成绩的主要经验是：
    一、党委领导，书记挂帅，开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动：常牧大队党委在牧业合作化时即着手组织绵羊丰产试验群。但是当时不少干部和群众对大队党委制定的绵羊“一年两产或两年三产，三年加两番”的跃进计划有怀疑，表现信心不足。针对这些思想情况，大队党委由第一书记主持，先后开过四次会议，结合诉苦运动开展了社会主义和共产主义教育，本着既务虚又务实，虚实并举的精神，及时展开了鸣放辩论，批判右倾保守思想，研究实现绵羊高产的具体措施，有力的批判了“唯条件论”者、“牧区落后论”者的右倾观点，从而，鼓足了干劲，坚定了大跃进的信心。在绵羊高产试验群组成巩固后，党委又根据不同生产季节，及时召开现场会议，开展了接羔育羔、割草贮草、建立饲料基地的生产竞赛运动，先后评比十余次，有力的推动了生产的发展。
    二、牧工成了真正的主人：今年通过反封建斗争，使广大牧民群众受到了一次深刻的阶级教育，认清了两条道路的发展前途，大大提高了阶级觉悟，发挥了劳动牧民当家作主的积极性，出现了爱社如家、爱畜如子的动人事例。试验羊群牧工觉勒认为现在“幸福的太阳照到自己门上了，不把羊放好心里就过不去”，因之不怕劳累，白天精心放羊，深夜守护羊群。他所放牧的三百六十四只春羔，个个发育良好，体质健壮，并有七十三只母羊已发情受配。为了抓好畜膘保证高额丰产，在牧工的倡议下，建立了三班轮流放牧制，使放牧时间从原来的八小时延长到十三小时。第一班天拂晓出发，至吃早饭时换第二班，中午换第三班，下午至星星出来后将羊赶回。这样既不会因牧工吃饭耽误放牧，也不会因无人看管而损失羊只，保证了羊只体质健壮。
    三、因时因地的进行放牧，让羊只吃饱、吃好、喝足：为了保证牲畜常年有足够的草吃，在四季轮牧的基础上，进一步实行了分区分片轮牧制度，选择草好水足羊只最爱吃的草场上放牧。并根据各个季节的不同情况，采取夏季放高山远山，避免在平川受热和蚊蝇骚扰危害；秋季放花草，防霜草，并避免在汭滩牧地放牧，防止感染肝片形吸虫病和因潮湿引起腐蹄病；冬春在山沟平川避风向阳的地区放牧，青草发芽后，先吃黄后吃青，避免过食引起羊快疫。春、夏、秋三季每天饮水二、三次，冬天饮水一次，防止饮水过少或过多影响抓膘和保膘。
    四、增加种公羊，实现全配满怀：今年配种期间根据老牧工的经验，按一比十三的比例，增加种公羊的数量，以增加配种次数，消灭了空怀。
    五、防止流产，精心接羔育幼：为了防止流产，在母羊怀胎期间，避免在高山陡坡的牧场上放牧，不让母羊吃霜草，将早晚饮水改为中午饮水，做到羊圈宽敞舒适，出入圈门不拥挤，保证了两次怀胎，安全生产。产羔期间做到白天不离群，夜晚不离圈，轮流守护。并且每人都置备了接羔袋，每装一次羔羊，用草木灰消毒一次，防止传染疾病和母羊不认羔的现象发生。
    六、建立饲养基地，及时进行补饲：该队今年开垦荒地八百三十六亩，种青燕麦一百一十三亩，收获燕麦草十四万八千九百五十斤，打贮青干草七十四万三千四百五十斤，不仅保证了试验羊群的补饲青草，而且还可以供应其他牧群的补饲，实现了四季常青，满膘过冬。对试验羊群从11月开始，每只羊每天补饲一斤青干草，直到青草发芽时为止。为了防止羊群拥挤践踏浪费青干草，采用了“吊草补饲法”。
    七、小病不出群，大病不出队：为了加强兽疫防治工作，在党委的具体领导下，全队抽调二十五名青年男女组织了兽医排，以师傅带徒弟边教、边学、边作的办法，培养了技术力量，使每个畜群都有懂得一般兽医技术的牧工，认真贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，及时的进行了羊痘、炭疽、羊快疫的预防注射。普遍做到小病不出群，大病不出队。
    为了掀起明年畜牧业生产的更大跃进，县委决定专人检查帮助，加强领导。目前除作好越冬保畜工作外，正千方百计增强牲畜体质，作到随产随配，力争明年4月产一胎，冬季再产一胎。（附图片）
