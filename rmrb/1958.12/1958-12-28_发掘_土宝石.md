    Discovering "Earthen Gems"
    Kunming Dapuji Climate Station, Yunnan

    Our ancestors accumulated many "earthen gems"—agricultural proverbs for overcoming nature—through thousands of years of agricultural production. We decided to go to the countryside to conduct agricultural climate surveys, humbly learn from farmers, summarize farmers' experiences, and unearth "earthen gems" to serve large-scale agricultural production. With the support of the Party committee, we spent only a short time initially completing the agricultural climate survey work in Xishan District, Kunming City. From this agricultural climate survey, we discovered many "earthen gems," which not only effectively served local agriculture but also greatly enriched the content of our agricultural meteorology science.

                Farmers Can Predict Weather

    Farmers, based on years of accumulated experience, observe the characteristics of phenology and the condition of the sky, writing poetic proverbs to predict future weather: "If the mountain wears a hat, it will rain; if the mountain wears a sash, there will be no rain;" "A rainbow in the east, the sun shines; a rainbow in the west, it rains;" "Swallows flying high, the weather is good; swallows flying low, rain is coming;" and so on. Some farmers use the lunar calendar and observe the stars, the crescent moon, and the "Tu Huang Tian" (referring to the eighteen days from the last three days of the Cold Dew period to fifteen days after the Frost's Descent period) to predict the dryness, wetness, coldness, and heat of the coming month and year. This year, on the third day of the eighth lunar month, farmers in Jishan Township saw that the crescent moon was very steep and black at the bottom, and combined with other signs, predicted two heavy rains in the next ten days, and they were all correct.

    Farmers Understand the "Hearts" of Crops

    Farmers are with crops year after year, familiar with the needs of various crops in different periods and under different conditions. As the saying goes: "South wind, the valley (rice) is full in the granary; north wind, the valley is only a bag of chaff; a bit of sun, a bit of rain, no fear of not having white rice to cook;" "Wheat fears frost during the Qingming period, rice fears drought in autumn;" "People fear poverty in old age, rice fears autumn night rain." These words illustrate that winter wheat cannot withstand frost damage after jointing during the Qingming period, and rice fears both drought and low temperatures from the booting stage to the grain-filling stage. In the southwestern region, a summer-autumn north wind indicates low temperatures and cloudy and rainy weather, which is unfavorable for rice flowering. The most suitable weather is sunshine and showers. After farmers master these conditions and local climate characteristics, and combine them with future weather forecasts, they take various measures to prevent unfavorable weather conditions and strive for a good harvest. For example, they select appropriate varieties, transplant seedlings early, and adopt frequent and shallow irrigation and other measures to promote good crop growth and early heading and flowering. Farmers in Jishan Township determine the depth of irrigation according to the different growth stages of rice as follows: shallow water of one inch during the seedling stage, shallow water of one to one and a half inches during the transplanting and greening stage, about one inch during the tillering stage, and deep water of about three inches from the booting and heading stage to the grain-filling stage. This is a good measure to increase water temperature and improve the microclimate of farmland according to the needs of rice at different stages.

          Twenty-Four Solar Terms Are a Calendar for Arranging Agricultural Affairs

    The sowing, transplanting, harvesting, and other major agricultural activities of various local crops are mostly arranged according to the twenty-four solar terms. For example, "Early Qingming, late Summer Solstice, the best time to transplant seedlings is at the Beginning of Summer;" "No need to hoe when transplanting during Minor Heat, no need to use a knife when transplanting during Major Heat;" "If rice does not head during White Dew, it will not bow its head during Cold Dew;" "Before and after Grain Rain, plant melons and sow beans," and so on. Every year the weather is different, and farmers must also make more detailed and appropriate arrangements for some major agricultural activities such as sowing dates, according to the weather characteristics of the year.

    "Earthen Gems" Show Their Power

    There is a model worker in Xishan District, Kunming City, who is very experienced in observing the sky and predicting the weather. If he says it will rain, it will rain. The surrounding farmers call him "Heavenly Master." Every harvest season, he organizes several experienced old farmers to observe weather changes to ensure that harvesting can proceed smoothly, so everyone calls them the "Heavenly Master Association." This model worker can not only observe the sky but also understands the weather conditions required by various crops, and can propose many measures to utilize favorable meteorological conditions and overcome unfavorable meteorological conditions to ensure increased production, such as frequent and shallow irrigation, frequent weeding, seedling tamping, warm bed seedling raising, and preventing lodging.

    Because we summarized the experience of the masses, based on the treasures left by our ancestors, combined with historical meteorological and agricultural meteorological data, we made a climate outlook for the entire year of 1958 (several elements such as precipitation and temperature) for the Dapuji area in February of this year. In September, we made agricultural meteorological forecasts for the rice harvesting period and wheat sowing period in the Kunming area, as well as outlooks for frost, low temperatures, and rainfall from October this year to April 1959. These agricultural meteorological forecasts and climate outlooks, which came from the farmers and returned to the farmers, played a significant role in production. Before obtaining "earthen gems," the accuracy rate of the climate station's supplementary weather forecasts was only about 70%. After we fully utilized "earthen gems," the forecast accuracy rate increased to 91%.

    发掘“土宝石”
    云南昆明大普吉气候站
    我们祖先几千年的农业生产实践积累了不少的“土宝石”——战胜自然的农谚。我们决定到农村中去进行农业气候调查，虚心向农民学习，总结农民经验，挖掘“土宝石”，为农业的大面积丰产服务。我们在党委的支持下，只花了短短的一段时间，初步完成了昆明市西山区的农业气候调查工作。从这次农业气候调查中，我们发现了许多“土宝石”，它们不仅为当地农业进行了有效的服务，还大大丰富了我们农业气象科学的内容。
                农民能预测天气
    农民根据多年积累下来的经验，看物候的特征，天空的状况，写成富有诗意的预测未来天气的农谚：有雨山戴帽，无雨山絮腰；东虹日头西虹雨；燕子高飞天气好，燕子低飞雨要来；等等。有些农民用推算阴历，观看星星、月牙、土皇天
  （是指寒露尾三天霜降后十五天共十八天而言）等预测未来一月一年的干、湿、冷、热情况。今年农历八月初三，积善乡农民看到月牙很陡，底部黑，并结合其它征象，预报未来十天的两次大雨，结果全都对了。农民摸透了作物的“心”
    农民长年累月同农作物在一起，熟悉了各种作物在不同时期和不同情况下的需要。俗语说：南风谷子（稻）堆满仓，北风谷子一包糠，一阵太阳一阵雨，不怕没有白米烹；麦怕清明霜，谷（稻）怕秋来旱；人怕老来穷，谷怕秋夜雨。这几句话说明冬小麦在清明拔节后经不起霜冻为害，水稻从孕穗到灌浆时既怕干旱，又怕低温。在西南地区夏秋北风表示低温阴雨，对水稻开花不利，最适宜的天气是有太阳和阵雨。农民掌握了这些条件和本地的气候特征以后，再结合未来的天气预测，采取各种措施来预防不利的天气条件，争取丰收。例如他们选用适当的品种，提早栽秧，以及采用勤灌浅灌等措施来促使作物生育良好、提早抽穗开花等。积善乡农民按水稻不同生育期确定灌水的深浅度如下：秧苗期浅水一寸，移栽期返青浅水一至一点五寸，发稞期一寸左右，打苞抽穗到灌浆期灌深水三寸左右。这是一个针对水稻不同时期的需要，提高水温，改善农田小气候的良好措施。
          二十四节气是安排农事的日历
    当地各种作物的播种、栽秧、收割等大都按二十四节气来安排。例如，清明早，夏至迟，立夏栽秧最当时；小暑栽秧不用薅，大暑栽秧不用刀；白露不抽穗，寒露不低头；谷雨前后，种瓜又点豆等等。每年天气不同，农民还要根据当年的天气特点对一些主要农事活动如播种期等作出更细致而又恰当的安排。
    “土宝石”大显神通
    昆明市西山区有一位劳动模范，看天测候的经验非常丰富，说有雨，就有雨。周围的农民都叫他“天师”。每逢收割期，他就组织几个有经验的老农观看天气变化，保证收割能顺利进行，因而大家都叫他们为“天师会”。这位劳动模范不仅能看天，而且对各种作物所需要的天气条件也很了解，并能提出许多利用有利的气象条件和克服不利的气象条件的保证增产的措施，如勤灌浅灌，勤薅草，踏苗，温床育秧，防止倒伏等等。
    由于总结了群众的经验，以祖先遗留的宝藏为主，结合历年气象与农业气象的资料，我们于今年2月作出了大普吉地区1958年全年的气候展望（降水、温度等几个要素）。在9月作出了昆明地区水稻收割期、小麦播种期的农业气象预报以及从今年10月至1959年4月的霜冻、低温、降雨的展望。这些来自农民而又回到农民中去的农业气象预报以及气候 展望在生产中起到很大的作用。在未得到“土宝石”以前，气候站补充天气预报准确率只有70％左右，当我们充分利用了“土宝石”以后，预报准确率便提高到91％。
