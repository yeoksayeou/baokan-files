    They Are the Masters of Machines
    ——A Record of the "Red Machine Tool Design Institute" Organized by Workers of the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory
    By Our Correspondent Fan Yinhuai

    Arriving at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, it truly felt like entering a multi-disciplinary scientific research institution. In front of the factory buildings hung white wooden plaques with the bright red characters: "Red Machine Tool Design Institute," "East Wind Design Institute"... These days, each workshop displayed over four hundred newly manufactured machine tools, rolling mills, bottom-dropping boring machines designed and made by the workers themselves. They decorated them with colorful paper strips, making them look like a garden of flowers. From the clear and concise instructions, it could be seen that this batch of new machine tools was made in spare time, mostly using old materials and waste materials.

    In the Red Machine Tool Design Institute
    In the noisy machine shop, a small blackboard was covered with sketches of gears and machine tool frames. Tian Zhen, the secretary of the workshop Party committee and deputy director of the Design Institute, told us: These sketches were drawn by the workers in the workshop while discussing and designing. Now, new products have been made based on these sketches. Several silver-gray machine tools were particularly eye-catching. Meng Xilong, a veteran lathe operator and work area director, was operating a machine tool with a cement base and simple structure. After a while, he suddenly stopped the machine and excitedly announced the test results: the drilling depth was two hundred centimeters, and the efficiency was doubled compared to the original. Another worker chimed in, saying that the machine tool parts had been reduced by seven hundred and fifty, and the weight had been reduced by one thousand kilograms! Everyone's faces were filled with joy and confidence.

    This is a large, precision lathe supplied to many regions across the country. The workers who manufactured and used this lathe felt that many of its parts were either unnecessary or of questionable utility. They repeatedly requested the factory to modify the design and simplify the structure of the lathe, but their requests were shelved by the technical staff. In early November, the factory Party committee decided to hand over the inspection, technology, and design management to the workers for discussion and modification. Everyone agreed at the time, but some workers themselves were a bit unsure whether they had the ability to modify it. Old Tian, the secretary of the factory Party committee, firmly encouraged the workers to try boldly. That night, each work area established design institutes to study and modify design projects. Someone said that removing the machine tool legs could save more than 1,700 yuan. Senior master Zhang Shuangheng flatly said: "Seven parts can be removed from the lathe tailstock, and the space left can also be used to increase the center, making the lathe more versatile." After everyone agreed on the modification projects, they went to work separately, requiring that the finished product be produced within three days.

    It Didn't "Fall Apart"
    The lathe and milling groups of workers disassembled a lathe with everyone pitching in, and took the parts to be modified to work on them. Only technician Tian Qijin from the technical group was anxiously bustling about.

    Why was Tian Qijin worried? It turned out that he had visited the Jinan Machine Tool Factory in September and also felt that the structure of the tailstock and transmission part was too complex and needed to be modified. So he and another technician studied the modifications, but for a long time they couldn't decide which parts to modify and how to modify them. Now the workers were going to remove the bed legs and were taking action without drawings, which really startled him! The importance of the lathe bed legs was like the human heart; the transmission, lubrication, cooling, and motor equipment were all installed inside. Where could they be placed? He was afraid that everyone would "fall apart."

    The parts taken out of the bed legs were removed where they should be removed, and moved where they should be moved, without affecting the performance of the machine tool. However, the lubricator taken out of the bed legs was difficult to handle; it couldn't be removed, but there was no place to put it if it wasn't removed. At this time, master Jia Xinghua had a stroke of inspiration. He placed the greasy and stained lubricator into the headstock, which saved oil and was hygienic. At first, there were some minor problems with oil leakage. He used chicken feather rope to clamp it under the lubricator, and quickly overcame this problem.

    Technician Tian saw that he hadn't accomplished anything in two months, but the workers had made it in three days and installed it perfectly. His mood was relieved, but he had many emotions. He felt that he hadn't fully recognized the wisdom and strength of the working masses, and he felt a bit of hidden pain. Like giving the lathe an "appendectomy," he needed to remove the "appendix" of not believing in the masses.

    他们是机器的主宰
    ——记山西机床厂工人组织的“红色机床设计院”
    本报记者  范银怀
    来到山西机床广，真像进了多科性的科学研究机关，厂房门前挂着洁白底面的木牌，上面写着鲜红的大字：“红色机床设计院”“东风设计院”……。这几天各车间展出了工人自己设计、制造的四百多台新制的车床、轧钢机、落底搪……他们用彩色纸条把它打扮得花团锦簇。从清晰、简明的说明书上可以看出，这批新机床都是在业余时间，大部是用旧料、废料制作的。
    在红色机床设计院
    机器喧嚣的车间里，一块小黑板上画着许多齿轮、车床架草图。车间党委书记、设计院副院长田珍告诉我们：这些草图都是工人们在车间里边讨论、边设计画出来的。现在已经根据这个草图制出了新产品。几台银灰色的车床，特别引人注视，老车工、工区主任孟喜龙操纵着一台水泥底座、结构简单的车床。一会儿，他突然煞住车，兴冲冲地宣布试车结果：钻孔深度二百公分，效率比原来提高了一倍。另一个工人抢着说，可是车床零件比过去减少了七百五十个，重量减轻一千公斤！大家脸上漾起喜悦而自信的神色。
    这是一种供给全国许多地区的大型精密车床。制造和使用这种车床的工人感到这种车床可用可不用的部件很多。他们多次要求厂里修改设计、简化车床结构，都被技术人员搁置下来，11月上旬，厂党委决定把检验、工艺、设计管理都交给工人讨论、更改。当时大家同声赞同，但有些工人自己也有点不大相信自己有本事修改。厂党委书记老田坚定地激励工人大胆试制。当天晚上各工区纷纷成立设计所，研究修改设计项目。有人说去掉车床腿，就能节约一千七百多元。老师傅张双恒断然说：“车床尾架可以去掉七个零件，腾下的地方还可以加大顶尖，使车床使用范围更广泛。”大家议定了修改项目后，就分头去干，要求在三天内拿出成品来。”
    并没有“乱了套”
    车工组、铣工组工人七手八脚把一台车床拆卸开，分别拿去要修改的零件干起来了。只有技术组技师田启金带着紧张的神情到处张罗。
    田启金为什么提心吊胆？原来他9月份从济南机器厂参观回来，也觉得这种尾架和变速部分构造太庞杂、需要修改。于是就和另一位技术员研究修改，但是修改些什么部件，怎样修改，很长时间肯定不下来。现在工人们要去掉床腿，并且没有图纸就行动开了，真使他大吃一惊！这种车床的床腿的重要和人的心脏一样，变速、润滑、冷却、电机设备都装置在里边，可往那里安插呀？他怕大家“乱了套”。
    从床腿里拿出来的部件该去的去，该挪动的挪动，都没有妨害了机床的性能。但从车床腿里取出的润滑器很难处理，去掉不行，不去掉却没有归落。这时贾兴华老师傅异想天开。他把污油的、满渍的润滑器安置到床头里，结果既省油、又卫生。起初还有些漏油的小毛病、他用鸡毛绳夹在润滑器下面，很快就克服了这个流弊。
    田技师看到自己费了两个月时间也没有闹出个名堂来，工人们三天就制造出来了，并且安装得天衣无缝，心境是松快了，感慨却很多。他感到自己没有充分认识到工人群众的智慧力量，有点隐痛。如像给车床“割盲肠”一样，需要割除自己不相信群众的“盲肠”。
