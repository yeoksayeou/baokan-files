Taking the Path of "Self-Reliance"
	He Bao'an, Director of Beijing Jianguo Steel Rolling Mill, Jiang Hong, Party Branch Secretary

	Our factory's workers, through self-reliance, clever work, and hard work, have manufactured six 230cm steel rolling mills and established a workshop with an annual output of over 15,000 tons of diverse steel products. Immediately following this, they are rushing to install five self-made 400cm steel rolling mills, which will form a workshop with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel. This workshop will be put into production in January next year. After this workshop is put into production, our factory's production capacity will be equivalent to 2.5 times the expected steel output for 1958.

	Our factory's self-arming with self-made steel rolling equipment didn't have excellent conditions. In terms of machine tools, there were only five lathes, four ordinary shapers and universal milling machines, no cranes, and no casting equipment. In the past, we never dared to think about making our own steel rolling equipment. This year, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committee, all the factory's workers studied and discussed the Party Central Committee's principle of "taking steel as the key link to drive everything else." Everyone believed that having steel meant it had to be quickly turned into steel products. Thus, a surge of self-reliant, large-scale steel rolling equipment construction unfolded in our factory. The workers put forward the slogan "Strive for speed, race against time; if there's no steel rolling equipment, we'll make it ourselves!" Fitter Zhou Ping's group, together with the welders, used steel ingots and steel plates to weld gearboxes and reducer housings. Without a large gantry planer to process the five-ton castings, they adopted the method of "ants gnawing bones" and "breaking the big into small," using a shaper for processing and then welding them together. Turner Sun Zengming manufactured a native boring machine, solving the problem of reducer boring. All design and process procedures were carried out by technicians and veteran workers together. Guide beam, guide and other parts are the steel rolling workers use waste welding.

	In the process of mobilizing the masses to self-reliantly manufacture steel rolling equipment, we have waged a struggle against the "hand-out faction." Facts have proved that the process of manufacturing steel rolling equipment is the process of breaking down the superstition towards the manufacturing of steel rolling mills, and it is the process of carrying out a large-scale technical revolution throughout the factory. The employees of the welding rod workshop used old parts picked up from the scrap iron pile to manufacture more than ten units of equipment such as electric screens, native lathes, and grinding machines. The machine repair workshop manufactured native cranes and vertical lathes, and is now rushing to make larger equipment such as shapers.

	According to our experience, manufacturing steel rolling mills is not too difficult. As long as we boldly mobilize the masses and break down superstitions, any difficulties can be solved easily. At present, our factory's workers are working selflessly with full confidence to complete the entire set of equipment for the new steel rolling workshop and are actively preparing for the rolling of cutting-edge products such as ball bearings next year.

    走“自力更生”的路
    北京建国轧钢厂厂长  贺保安  党支部书记  江洪
    我们厂的职工，自力更生，巧干苦干，制成了二百三十厘米轧钢机六架，建立了一个年产一万五千吨多品种钢材的车间。紧接着又突击安装自己制造的五架四百厘米轧钢机，由它们组成一个年产五万吨钢材的车间。这个车间将在明年1月投入生产。这个车间投入生产以后，我厂的生产能力将相当于1958年预计完成钢材产量的二点五倍。
    我厂自制轧钢设备武装自己，并没有优异的条件。论机床，只有车床五台，普通牛头刨床和万能铣床四台，没有吊车，也没有铸造设备。过去，我们根本不敢想自制轧钢设备。今年在市委、区委的领导下，全厂职工学习讨论了党中央“以钢为纲，带动一切”的方针，大家认为，有了钢，还必须把钢迅速地变成材。于是一个自力更生地大搞轧钢设备的热潮便在我厂展开了。工人提出了“争速度，赶时间，没有轧钢设备自己干”的口号。钳工周萍小组和电焊工一起，用钢锭和钢板焊成了齿轮箱和减速机箱体。没有大龙门刨床加工五吨重的铸件，就采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”和“化大为小”的方法用牛头刨加工，加工后再焊接。车工孙增明制造土搪床一台，解决了减速机搪孔的问题。全部设计、工艺过程是技术员和老工人一起搞的。导板梁、导板等零件是轧钢工人利用废料焊接成的。
    在我们发动群众自力更生地制造轧钢设备的过程中，曾经同“伸手派”进行了斗争。事实证明：制造轧钢设备的过程，就是破除对制造轧钢机的迷信的过程，就是在全厂范围内大闹技术革命的过程。焊条车间职工们利用在废铁堆里拣来的旧零件，制造了电筛、土车床、磨头机等十余台。机修车间制造了土天车、立车床，现在正赶制牛头车床等较大的设备。
    根据我们的体会，制造轧钢机并不是太困难的事情，只要放手发动群众，破除迷信，任何困难都会迎刃而解。目前，我厂职工正满怀信心地为完成新轧钢车间的全套设备而进行着忘我的劳动，并积极为明年轧制滚珠等尖端产品进行准备。
