Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. Premier Kim Il-sung of the Korean Cabinet stated today at a mass rally in Pyongyang welcoming the return of the Korean government delegation from visits to China and Vietnam that the friendly visit of the Korean government delegation to the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has great political significance. This visit made a great contribution to further strengthening the friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and the people of China and Vietnam.

Premier Kim Il-sung spoke about the visit activities of the Korean government delegation in China and the warm welcome it received from the Chinese people everywhere. He said that the delegation, together with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, held talks in a friendly atmosphere on the current international situation, the issue of further strengthening the friendship and solidarity between Korea and China, and the issue of further strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp, and reached unanimous agreement on all issues. He said that during the delegation's visit to China, the moving scenes of the Chinese people warmly welcoming the delegation everywhere clearly demonstrated the unbreakable friendship and solidarity forged in blood between the people of Korea and China in the long-term common struggle against foreign imperialists, especially the aggression of US imperialism. The friendship between the people of the two countries who share weal and woe in the struggle against aggressors is deeper than the affection between flesh and blood brothers. He said that the fraternal Chinese people will always stand by the Korean people in the common struggle for peace and socialism and, through the Korean government delegation, expressed their firm determination to fight alongside the Korean people whenever necessary in the future.

Premier Kim Il-sung then spoke about the delegation's visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the warm welcome it received. He said that the Korean and Vietnamese people are fighting together against US imperialist aggression and for the reunification of their fatherlands, and are carrying out close cooperation in socialist construction. The friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and Vietnam, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, will be further strengthened and developed in the future.

Premier Kim Il-sung spoke in detail to the masses about the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. He said that the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have made great achievements in socialist construction. The Great Leap Forward movement in China's socialist construction demonstrates the great creativity of the 650 million Chinese people who firmly hold their destiny in their own hands. He said that what was particularly impressive to the delegation was the nationwide movement to produce steel that was launched throughout China. China will catch up with and surpass Britain in terms of major industrial products such as steel within the next few years.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the growth of the power of the People's Republic of China is also the growth of the power of the entire socialist camp, which plays a huge role in maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and has a strong influence on the liberation struggle of the colonial and oppressed people.

Premier Kim Il-sung then spoke about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to build and reunify their country. He said that the Vietnamese people faced many difficulties in the post-war period, but the heroic Vietnamese people, tempered in the flames of war, are firmly united around the Vietnamese Labor Party, bravely overcame all difficulties, and made great achievements in the cause of restoring the damaged national economy.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea, China, and Vietnam, and the victorious development of socialist construction in these countries, is a demonstration of the great strength of the Eastern people who are rising up to create a new life. No force can overcome this power of the newborn Eastern people.

Premier Kim Il-sung condemned the US imperialists for still ignoring the great historical changes taking place in the East and attempting to resist this reality. He said that US imperialism continues to occupy the southern half of Korea and China's territory of Taiwan, and refuses to withdraw its aggressive claws from South Vietnam. But these are just the last struggles of the US imperialists.

Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that the Chinese and Vietnamese people, like the Korean people, have a glorious history of achieving victory in the arduous struggle against the imperialists, and the strength of the people of the three countries is growing stronger day by day. At the same time, the three countries are all glorious members of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and are firmly united with the people of all socialist countries in this camp's big family.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the victory of socialism and the demise of capitalism is the law of historical development. The desperate struggles of the imperialists headed by the United States to try to turn back the wheels of history are bound to fail. He said that the day will surely come when imperialism is driven out of the East. The Korean people must peacefully reunify their fatherland, Taiwan must be returned to the Chinese people, and North and South Vietnam must achieve unification.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that during the Korean government delegation's visit to China and Vietnam, the people of China and Vietnam praised the Korean people for their spirit of dashing towards socialism with the momentum of the Chollima (flying horse). At the same time, the fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union are actively supporting Korea's socialist construction. He called on the Korean people to further strengthen internationalist solidarity with the socialist camp and to unite more closely around the Korean Labor Party, and to wage a tenacious struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the rapid development of socialist construction.

    朝中越人民团结威力日益强大
    帝国主义被赶出东方日子将到
    金日成首相在平壤谈访问中越印象
    新华社平壤10日电  朝鲜内阁首相金日成今天在平壤市欢迎朝鲜政府代表团访问中国、越南归来的群众大会上发表讲话说，朝鲜政府代表团对中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国进行的友好访问有着巨大的政治意义。这次访问对进一步加强朝鲜人民同中国和越南两国人民之间的友谊团结作出了巨大贡献。
    金日成首相谈到朝鲜政府代表团在中国进行的访问活动和到处受到中国人民热烈欢迎的情况。他说，代表团同以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和政府领导人就目前国际局势和进一步加强朝中两国间的友谊团结问题、关于进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结问题，在友好的气氛中进行了会谈，并且在所有问题上取得了一致的意见。他说，在代表团访问中国期间，中国人民到处热烈欢迎代表团的动人场面，清楚地显示了朝中两国人民在反对外来帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者的侵略的长期共同斗争中以鲜血结成的牢不可破的友谊和团结。在反对侵略者的斗争中共甘苦同生死的两国人民之间的这种友谊比骨肉兄弟之情还要深厚。他说，兄弟的中国人民在为和平和社会主义事业而进行的共同斗争中，将永远站在朝鲜人民这一边，并且通过朝鲜政府代表团向全体朝鲜人民表明了自己的坚定不移的决心：在今后任何必要的时候都将同朝鲜人民并肩战斗。
    金日成首相接着谈到代表团在越南民主共和国进行的访问和受到的热烈欢迎。他说，朝鲜人民和越南人民一起，为反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国的统一进行着斗争，并且在社会主义建设中进行着紧密的合作。基于无产阶级国际主义原则的朝越两国人民之间的友谊团结将在今后进一步得到加强和发展。
    金日成首相向到会群众详尽地谈到中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的成就。他说，兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。中国的社会主义建设大跃进运动显示了把自己的命运牢牢地掌握在自己手中的六亿五千万中国人民的伟大的创造力。他说，对代表团说来印象特别深刻的是在中国各地展开的全民生产钢铁的运动。中国在今后数年内要在钢铁等主要工业产品方面赶上和超过英国。
    金日成首相说，中华人民共和国的威力的增长也就是整个社会主义阵营威力的增长，这对维护亚洲和世界和平起着巨大的作用，对殖民地和被压迫的人民的解放斗争发生强烈的影响。
    金日成首相接着谈到越南人民建设和争取统一国家的英雄斗争。他说，越南人民在战后时期面临许多困难，但是，在战火中锻炼出来的英雄的越南人民坚强地团结在越南劳动党的周围，勇敢地克服了一切困难，并且在恢复被破坏的人民经济的事业中取得了巨大成就。
    金日成首相说，朝鲜、中国和越南人民之间的友谊团结和这些国家社会主义建设的胜利发展，是奋起创造新生活的东方人民的伟大力量的示威。任何力量也不能战胜新生的东方人民的这种威力。
    金日成首相谴责美帝国主义者仍然无视在东方发生的伟大的历史转变，并且企图抗拒这种现实。他说，美帝国主义继续强占着朝鲜的南半部和中国的领土台湾，并且不肯从南越缩回它的侵略魔爪。但是，这些只不过是美帝国主义者的最后挣扎。
    金日成首相指出，中国人民和越南人民同朝鲜人民一样，有着在同帝国主义者进行的艰苦斗争中取得胜利的光辉历史，三国人民的力量正在日益强大。同时，三个国家都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的光荣的成员，在这个阵营的大家庭里同一切社会主义国家人民巩固地团结在一起。
    金日成首相说，社会主义胜利、资本主义灭亡是历史发展的法则。以美国为首的帝国主义者妄想使历史车轮倒转而进行的绝望挣扎不可避免地要遭到失败。他说，帝国主义被赶出东方的日子必然到来。朝鲜人民一定要和平统一自己的祖国，台湾一定要归还中国人民；越南北南两方一定要实现统一。
    金日成首相说，在朝鲜政府代表团访问中越两国期间，中越两国人民盛赞朝鲜人民以跨上千里马的气势向社会主义奔驰的干劲。同时，以苏联为首的兄弟国家都在积极支持朝鲜的社会主义建设事业。他号召朝鲜人民进一步加强同社会主义阵营各国之间的国际主义团结，并且更加紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党的周围，为争取祖国的和平统一和社会主义建设事业的飞速发展进行顽强的斗争。
