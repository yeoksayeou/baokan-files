From the Readers

	New Style in Publications
	"Let the workers and peasants run the publications, let the workers and peasants write the articles, let the workers and peasants judge whether the publications are good or not." These are the last four sentences of the "Notice to Readers" from the "Beijing Literature and Art" editorial department. They not only said this, but they also did it. In the October issue of "Beijing Literature and Art," they published seven or eight works by workers and peasants, accounting for almost half of the issue. This "say what you mean and do what you say" style is the style of communism. Only by publishing more works by workers and peasants in publications can we further arouse the love of workers and peasants for the publications.
	To launch a broad mass creation upsurge and continue to push the cultural revolution to a higher climax, we must mobilize the broad masses to write, especially the worker and peasant masses. Publications should use more space to publish works by workers and peasants. I hope that all publications will be as thoroughly oriented towards the worker and peasant masses as "Beijing Literature and Art."

	Print Table of Major Characters
	I suggest that when publishing long novels, a table of major characters in the work should be printed in the front of the book.
	Recently, I read several long novels such as "Small Town in Spring," "Red Sun," "Song of Youth," and "Morning in Shanghai." Because I read them in fragments during my spare time (I think many readers also finish long novels intermittently during their spare time), it is easy to forget the characters that appear before and after in the reading process. When reading later, I have to turn back to the front to check the characters before I can remember them. If the publishing house can briefly introduce the main characters, it will be of great convenience to the readers.  (Troops stationed in Nanjing, Zhou Chuyuan)
	Publish More Popular Editions
	After the China Youth and PLA Literature and Art Publishing Houses printed and distributed some popular editions of several famous long novels, they were very popular among the readers here. Because the popular editions have clear fonts, good paper, and are cheap. Not only do comrades who love literary works like them, but also some comrades who rarely bought books before are now buying many kinds at once.
	What the publishing house is doing is in line with the spirit of "more, faster, better, and more economical." I hope that all publishing houses can do the same. (Li Yuanju, Police Brigade of Changwei District, Shandong)

    读者中来
    刊物新风
    “工农刊物工农办，工农写稿工农看，刊物办得好不好，依靠工农来评判”。这是“北京文艺”编辑部的“告读者”里的末尾四句。他们不但这样说，而且也这样做了，在十月号“北京文艺”上就刊登了七八篇工农的作品，差不多占了本期上一半的篇幅。这种既说就办的作风，是共产主义的作风。只有刊物上多登工农的作品，才能更进一步引起工农对刊物的热爱。
    要掀起广泛的群众创作高潮，把文化革命继续推向更高潮，就必须发动广大群众来写作，特别是发动工农群众来进行写作，在刊物上就应当用更多的篇幅刊登工农的作品。我希望各个刊物都应像“北京文艺”这样彻底面向工农群众。

    加印主要人物表
    我建议出版长篇小说时，在书前加印作品中主要人物一览表。
    近来读了“小城春秋”、“红日”、“青春之歌”和“上海的早晨”几部长篇小说，因为是抽空断断续续的阅读的（我想也有不少读者是利用空闲间断读完长篇的），所以在阅读过程中，前后出现的人物易于遗忘，读到后面要重新往前面翻、查照人物，才能回忆得起来。假若出版社能对主要人物简要介绍，对读者阅读就有很大的方便了。  （驻南京部队  周初元）
    多出普及本
    中国青年、解放军文艺等出版社，将几部著名的长篇小说印制成一部分普及本发行后，很受我们这里读者的欢迎。因为普及本的字迹清晰，纸张也好，价格又便宜。不但爱好文学作品的同志喜欢它，而且一些以前很少买书看的同志，这会一个人一次都买了好多种。
    出版社这样做，是符合多快好省的精神的，希望各个出版社都能像他们这样做。（山东昌潍专区民警大队  李元聚）
