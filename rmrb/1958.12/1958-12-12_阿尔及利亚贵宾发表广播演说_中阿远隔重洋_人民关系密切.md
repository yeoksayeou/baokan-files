Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Mr. Sa'ad Dahlab, a member of the Algerian Provisional Government delegation and Director of the Information Office of the Provisional Government, stated in a radio address to the Chinese people tonight that the Algerian people will fight to the end until the dignity of the Algerian people is restored.

Sa'ad Dahlab delivered the radio address to the Chinese people on behalf of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the full text of the speech to the national audience tonight.

In his speech, Sa'ad Dahlab paid brotherly respect to the Chinese people and expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for inviting them to visit China, and to the Chinese people for their welcome and love. He said, "Although geographical environment separates us, the relationship between the Chinese people, who have suffered in the long war of liberation, and the Arab nation—especially the Algerian people—is extremely close. The spirit of fighting for freedom and national independence links us together." He pointed out that the unity between the Chinese and Algerian peoples is based on the love of freedom, independence, peace, and the will of all peoples, and this unity will be increasingly consolidated and strengthened.

Sa'ad Dahlab said: "We have personally seen the new face of China and the glorious work being done to build a happy, strong, prosperous, and free China. We are convinced that China will succeed and achieve victory. The Chinese government and people have deep sympathy for the Algerian people's struggle for independence today, and we all know the noble stand that China has taken on the entire cause of the Arab people's struggle against imperialism. The great Chinese people stand at the forefront of aiding Algeria, and the Chinese people were among the first to recognize our Provisional Government, which has inspired the Algerian people who have been waging a war of liberation for more than four years."

He said: "The imperialist bloc that supplies France with weapons owned by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization clearly knows that the revolutionary victory in Algeria will strengthen the convictions of all people who yearn for freedom, which will enhance their desire for liberation and will significantly promote the implementation of the Bandung principles.

"We believe that the Asian and African people have learned from their experiences that the road to freedom and independence is the only avenue to happiness, and the day is coming when the Asian and African people will gain their independence and freedom.

"The Algerian war of liberation plays a special role in eliminating imperialism, which makes the world's democratic forces support the Algerian cause. The Chinese people are supporting the Algerian people's war of liberation, and this practical support guarantees our victory."

Sa'ad Dahlab finally shouted slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!" "Long live Asian-African solidarity!" "Long live peace under the banner of freedom and independence!"

    阿尔及利亚贵宾发表广播演说
    中阿远隔重洋  人民关系密切
    新华社11日讯  阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团团员、临时政府宣传部办公室主任沙阿德·达列伯今天晚上在向中国人民发表的广播演说中说，阿尔及利亚人民将要斗争到底，直到恢复阿尔及利亚人民的尊严。
    沙阿德·达列伯是应中央人民广播电台的邀请，代表阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团向中国人民发表广播演说的。中央人民广播电台今天晚上向全国听众播送了这篇演说的全文。
    沙阿德·达列伯在演说中向中国人民致兄弟般的敬意，并且对中国政府邀请他们来中国访问、对中国人民对他们的欢迎和热爱表示感谢。他说：“尽管地理环境把我们分开，可是在长期解放战争中饱尝苦难的中国人民，和阿拉伯民族——特别是和阿尔及利亚人民之间的关系是极其密切的。为自由和民族独立而进行战斗的精神把我们连结在一起。”他指出，中国阿尔及利亚两国人民的团结是建立在热爱自由、独立、和平和各国人民意志的基础上的，这种团结将日益得到巩固和加强。
    沙阿德·达列伯说：“我们亲自看到了中国的新面貌，看到了为建立一个幸福的、强大的、繁荣的、自由的中国所进行的各项光荣的工作。我们确信中国将要得到成功、获得胜利。中国政府和人民对今天阿尔及利亚人民为独立所进行的斗争怀有深切的同情，我们都知道中国对阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义斗争的整个事业所采取的高贵立场。伟大的中国人民站在援助阿尔及利亚的前列，中国人民是首先承认我们临时政府的人民之一，这给进行了四年多解放战争的阿尔及利亚人民以鼓舞。”
    他说：“在阿尔及利亚战争中供给法国以北大西洋同盟所拥有的武器的帝国主义集团，清楚地知道阿尔及利亚的革命胜利将会加强所有渴望自由的人民的信念，这将会增强他们对解放的愿望，并且将显著地促进万隆原则的执行。
    “我们相信，亚非人民从他们的经验中已经知道，为自由和独立而斗争的道路是通向幸福的唯一大道，亚非人民获得他们的独立和自由的日子即将到来。
    “阿尔及利亚解放战争对消灭帝国主义起着特殊作用，这就使得世界民主力量支持阿尔及利亚事业。中国人民正在支援阿尔及利亚人民的解放战争，这种实际支持使我们的胜利得到保证。”
    沙阿德·达列伯最后欢呼“中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友谊万岁！”“亚非团结万岁！”“自由、独立旗帜下的和平万岁！”等口号。
