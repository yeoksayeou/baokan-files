    Mountainous Area’s Great Treasure – The Tung Tree
    Zhou Rusong
    In spring, from the south of Shaanxi and Henan in the north, to Zhejiang in the east, to Sichuan and Guizhou in the west, and to Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan in the south, across this vast land, whether in mountainous areas, hilly regions, along roadsides, or in front of and behind villages, one can see patches or individual trees covered in white flowers. By autumn, these trees are laden with green fruit among their green leaves. This is the tung tree, one of China's famous special products. Although the fruit of the tung tree is inedible, its seeds contain a lot of oil – tung oil.
    Tung oil is water-resistant, acid- and alkali-resistant, non-conductive, and dries easily, making it the best quality drying oil in the paint industry. The reason why the carriages of automobiles, airplanes, ships, and trains, as well as doors, windows, floors, and everyday furniture and appliances, are waterproof, corrosion-resistant, durable, and have a bright and beautiful appearance is because they are coated with a layer of tung oil or varnish made from tung oil. Tung oil can also be used to manufacture artificial leather, artificial gasoline, and plastics. Currently, approximately eight to nine hundred industries worldwide require tung oil. In addition, tung oilseed cake, after the oil has been extracted, is an excellent fertilizer. The outer shell of the fruit can be used to extract important chemical products such as potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and potassium permanganate. The bark contains tannin, which can be used to extract dyes and tanning agents for leather.
    Tung oil is a major product of the vast mountainous areas of southern China, and income from tung oil accounts for a large proportion of total income. The former Maopo Agricultural Cooperative in Cengong County, Guizhou, with a total of seventy-three households, had 545 mu of tung forests. In 1957, their income from tung seeds used for oil extraction was more than 22,700 yuan, accounting for 60% of the cooperative's total income. In the Zehexi team of the Duanlongshan People's Commune in Guzhang County, Hunan, with seventy-six households, the average income per household from tung oil alone this year reached 547 yuan.
    China is the world's largest producer of tung oil, with the highest annual output (1936) exceeding 153,000 tons, accounting for more than 90% of the world's total output. Later, due to the impact of the war, many tung forests were destroyed, and coupled with the exploitation by the reactionary ruling class, farmers in mountainous areas were unable to manage them, and most tung forests were left in a state of neglect. Tung oil production was greatly reduced, with only 96,000 tons produced in 1949, a decrease of 37% compared to 1936. After liberation, the Party and the government actively led and supported the masses in reclaiming abandoned tung forests and encouraged tung tree planting. The output of tung oil has been rapidly increased; at the same time, a large number of new tung forests have been cultivated. By 1957, more than 12 million mu of new tung trees had been planted nationwide, and tung oil production reached 150,000 tons, basically restoring the pre-war peak production level. This year's tung oil production is likely to reach 220,000 tons, an increase of 129% compared to 1949, exceeding the highest historical annual output by more than 43%.
    The tung tree is a high-yielding woody oil plant with great potential for increased production. According to the experience of various high-yield areas this year, the key to increasing yield per unit area lies first in liberating thinking, breaking the superstition that tung trees cannot produce high yields, and changing the state of allowing them to grow naturally without intervention. The best management method is to organize specialized production teams to strengthen management. In terms of technical measures, tung mountains should be deeply ploughed in winter and spring, and shallowly cultivated in summer and autumn, with more fertilizer applied and frequent weeding. Change from extensive management to intensive cultivation and management, and implement horticultural management and terraced slopes. In this way, the tung tree's unit yield can be quickly increased, increasing the income of people in mountainous areas and fully meeting the needs of the country's socialist construction.

    山区一大宝——油桐
    周如松
    春天，北至陕西、河南的南部，东到浙江，西至四川、贵州，南至广东、广西和云南，在这广阔的土地上，无论在山区，在丘陵地区，公路两旁和村庄前后，都可以看到成片的或一株株开着白花的树木。一到秋天，这些树木的绿叶丛中挂满了青色的果实。这就是我国著名特产之一的油桐树。油桐树的果实，虽然不能食用，但它的种子却含有很多的油——桐油。
    桐油不怕水，不怕酸、碱，不传电，容易干燥，是油漆工业上品质最好的干性油。汽车、飞机、轮船、火车的车厢，以及门、窗、地板和日常所用的家具、器具所以能够防水、防腐、坚固耐用而且外表光亮美观，就是因为涂上了一层桐油或者以桐油为原料的明漆。桐油还可以制造人造皮革、人造汽油和塑料等。现在世界上大约有八、九百种工业需用桐油。此外，榨过油的桐子饼是很好的肥料。果实的外壳，可以提制氢氧化钾、碳酸钾、高锰酸钾等重要化学药品。树皮含单宁，能提炼染料和鞣制皮革的鞣酸。
    桐油是江南广大山区的一项主要生产，桐油收入，在总收入中占着很大的比重。贵州岑巩县原毛坡农业社，共七十三户，有桐林五百四十五亩，1957年收桐子榨油收入二万二千七百多元，占全社总收入的60％。湖南古丈县断龙山人民公社泽禾溪队，七十六户，今年仅桐油一项收入平均每户达五百四十七元。
    我国是世界上产桐油最多的国家，最高年产量（1936年）为十五万三千余吨，占全世界总产量90％以上。以后由于战争的影响，很多的桐林遭到破坏，加以反动统治阶级的压榨，山区农民无力经营，大部桐林处于荒芜状态，桐油产量大减，1949年只产桐油九万六千多吨，与1936年比较，下降了37％。解放后，党和政府积极领导和扶持群众垦复荒芜桐林，并奖励植桐，桐油的产量得到迅速的提高；同时，还栽培了大量的新桐林。到1957年，全国新栽油桐一千二百多万亩，桐油的产量达到十五万吨，基本上恢复到战前的最高生产水平。今年的桐油产量可能达到二十二万吨，比1949年增长129％，超过历史最高年产量43％以上。
    油桐是高产的木本油料植物，增产的潜力很大。根据今年各丰产地区的经验，提高单位产量的关键，首先在于解放思想，破除油桐不能高产的迷信和改变任它自生自长的状态。最好的经营方法是组织专业生产队，加强经营管理。在技术措施上，油桐山冬春要深耕，夏秋要浅锄，还要多施肥，勤除草，改变粗放经营为精耕细作，实行管理园艺化，坡地梯田化。这样，就可以把油桐的单位产量很快地提高，以增加山区人民的收入，充分满足国家社会主义建设事业的需要。
