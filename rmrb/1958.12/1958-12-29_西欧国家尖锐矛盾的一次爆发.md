    An Outbreak of Sharp Contradictions Among Western European Countries
    By our correspondent Pan Fei
    A fierce economic and political struggle among Britain, France, and West Germany, in the form of currency exchange changes, suddenly erupted on the eve of the New Year. On the evening of the 27th, the French government announced: First, the French franc would be devalued by 17.55%; second, a "heavy franc" would be issued, with each "heavy franc" equal to one hundred old francs. At the same time, the British government announced the expansion of free convertibility of the pound sterling. Immediately afterwards, West Germany, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and other Western European countries adopted similar measures to those of Britain.
    The devaluation of the franc just six days after De Gaulle was elected president (the seventh devaluation since 1944) is clearly not a pleasant matter for this newly ascended "French leader." However, a huge fiscal deficit, the costly and wasteful Algerian war, and the exhaustion of gold and dollar reserves forced De Gaulle to take drastic action.
    The fact that the franc is being devalued precisely now, forcing French ministers to abandon their Christmas holidays and meet day and night to discuss the matter, is closely linked to the sharp struggle among Western European imperialists.
    French newspapers openly accuse Britain: The expansion of the scope of free convertibility of the pound is the direct cause of the devaluation of the franc. Because after the expansion of free convertibility of the pound, it undoubtedly increased the status of the pound sterling in the capitalist world's financial markets, which is a heavy pressure on the tottering franc. As for why Britain took this measure at this time, London's "Reynolds News" gave the following explanation: "Ten days ago, negotiations on a free trade zone surrounding the mutual reduction of tariffs broke down. It will not resume until January 15. However, starting next Thursday (i.e., January 1), France and its partners will reduce their mutual tariffs for the first time. This is discrimination against Britain. Britain feels it must retaliate."
    The consequences of this series of measures by Western European capitalist countries are still difficult to fully assess. However, at least the following points can be pointed out: First, the "European Payments Union," established eight years ago, has collapsed. This institution has "automatically declared its end" after Britain and France took the aforementioned measures. Second, the struggle among capitalist countries for commodity markets will be more intense than in the past. Because the purpose of expanding the scope of free convertibility of the pound is, in addition to putting pressure on the franc, also to expand British foreign trade. Similarly, France also intends to lower the price of French goods in the capitalist world market through the devaluation of the franc, in order to improve its competitiveness. Third, the Paris-Bonn axis has been further developed. The exchange rate between the new "heavy franc" and the West German mark is one to one, which means that West Germany will "support" the French franc. After the end of the "European Payments Union," France's debt within the organization (approximately six hundred million U.S. dollars) will also be resolved by loans provided by West Germany. The fact is that every contradiction between Britain and France means a sharp opposition between Britain and West Germany. At the same time, this also means a further expansion of West German power in Western Europe.

    西欧国家尖锐矛盾的一次爆发
    本报记者  潘非
    英法西德之间一场激烈的经济和政治斗争，以改变货币兑换的形式，在新年前夕突然爆发了。27日晚，法国政府宣布：一，法郎贬值17.55％；二，发行“重法郎”，每一“重法郎”等于一百个旧法郎。在同一时间，英国政府宣布扩大英镑自由兑换。紧接着，西德、意大利、瑞典、挪威、比利时、荷兰等西欧国家，采取了同英国类似的措施。
    在戴高乐被选为总统以后仅仅六天，法郎就宣告贬值（这是1944年以来的第七次贬值），这对于这位刚爬上台的“法国元首”，显然并不是件惬意的事情。然而，庞大的财政赤字，劳民伤财的阿尔及利亚战争，以及黄金美元储备的枯竭，逼得戴高乐只好上梁山。
    法郎恰恰在现在贬值，法国的部长们被迫着放弃了圣诞节的休假，并夜以继日地开会讨论这一事情，这是同西欧帝国主义之间的尖锐斗争密切联系着的。
    法国报纸公开指责英国：英镑扩大自由兑换的范围，是迫使法郎贬值的直接原因。因为英镑扩大自由兑换范围以后，无疑地提高了英镑在资本主义世界金融市场上的地位，这对于摇摇欲坠的法郎，是个沉重的压力。至于英国为什么要在目前采取这一措施，伦敦的“雷诺新闻”作了这样的解释：“十天以前，围绕着互相降低关税的自由贸易区的谈判破裂了。它将到1月15日才能恢复。但是，从下星期四（即1月1日）开始，法国和它的伙伴，将要第一次减少它们相互间的关税。这是对英国的歧视。英国感到必须报复。”
    西欧资本主义国家这一系列措施的后果，现在还很难全面评述。但是至少可以指出如下几点：一，建立了八年的“欧洲支付同盟”，已宣告垮台。这个机构在英法采取了前述的措施以后，已“自动宣布结束”。二，资本主义国家争夺商品市场的斗争，将比过去更加激烈。因为英镑扩大自由兑换范围的目的，除了对法郎施加压力以外，还企图扩大英国的对外贸易。同样地，法国也打算通过法郎的贬值，降低法国商品在资本主义世界市场上的价格，以提高自己的竞争能力。三，巴黎—波恩的轴心有了进一步的发展。新的“重法郎”和西德马克的兑换率为一比一，这意味着西德将“支持”法国法郎。“欧洲支付同盟”结束后法国在该组织内的债务（约六亿美元），也将由西德提供贷款来解决。事实是，英法之间的每一个矛盾，都意味着英国和西德之间的尖锐对立。同时，这也意味着西德势力在西欧的进一步扩张。
