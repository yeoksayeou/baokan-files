    新华社上海3日电  金日成首相和他率领的朝鲜政府代表团，由外交部副部长曾涌泉、中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光陪同，今天下午从杭州乘专机到达上海。专程由北京到上海迎接贵宾的陈毅副总理和住在上海的全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄都到机场欢迎。
    初冬的上海市今天阳光灿烂，温暖如春。全市人民喜气洋洋，有三十万人拿着鲜花彩旗，载歌载舞，夹道欢迎来自伟大邻邦朝鲜的贵宾们。机场上红旗招展，歌声嘹亮，一片节日景象。下午三时四十分，当贵宾们的座机在天空出现时，伫候在机场内外的人群顿时欢跃起来，乐队奏起了欢迎曲。“欢迎金日成首相”、“中朝人民的友谊万岁！”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    金日成首相穿着藏青色的外衣，神采奕奕地出现在机舱口，微笑着向热情欢呼的群众挥手致意。陈毅副总理、宋庆龄副委员长和上海市副市长许建国，中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋、魏文伯、马天水，中国人民解放军上海警备区司令员王必成中将等上前迎接首相和贵宾们。一群小女孩向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    前来机场欢迎的还有上海市副市长刘季平、刘述周、金仲华、荣毅仁、盛丕华和中国人民解放军驻沪部队的将领，上海各机关、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人。正在上海访问的朝鲜保健工作代表团和朝鲜在上海的留学生、实习生、侨民也前来欢迎。到机场欢迎的还有各国驻上海的领事。
    金日成首相和贵宾们在机场上会见了上海各界代表人士，和他们一一握手。王必成中将、季彬山少将和蔡永空军少将都曾经在抗美援朝中和朝鲜人民一起战斗过。今天，他们非常高兴地在祖国的和平土地上会见了朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成首相和其他朝鲜贵宾们。
    金日成首相穿过欢呼的人群，由陈毅副总理、许建国副市长陪同，乘坐敞篷汽车向市区缓缓驶去。从机场到迎宾馆十多里长的道路两旁，欢乐的人群和无数的鲜花、彩旗汇成一片欢乐的海洋。墙上、树上和高楼大厦的窗口，到处是密密层层的人们。
    贵宾的敞篷汽车经过的时候，人们敲起锣鼓，向贵宾们挥舞着鲜花和艳丽的头巾、彩带，欢呼“欢迎金日成首相”的口号，有的唱起了“金日成将军之歌”。芬芳的花瓣和纸花、彩带像雨一般地撒到贵宾们的身上。气球和和平鸽在欢呼声中飞向天空。在首相经过的道路上，花瓣就像铺成了一层彩色的地毯。
    金日成首相乘坐的敞篷汽车在人群中行进了一小时。直到下午五时，贵宾们才到达迎宾馆。
    欢迎队伍中，还有许多和朝鲜人民一道抗击美帝国主义侵略的志愿军复员军人和到过朝鲜的工人、文艺工作者和医务工作者。
