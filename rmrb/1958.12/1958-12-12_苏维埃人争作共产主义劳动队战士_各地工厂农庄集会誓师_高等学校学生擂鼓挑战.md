Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th The movement to establish "Communist Labor Brigades" is flourishing across the Soviet Union, growing in scale daily. In addition to factories, collective farms, state farms, and schools are also actively responding to the call to "work, study, and live with the Communist spirit," issuing challenges to one another.

In Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kuibyshev, and other places, workers at many factories made pledges at rallies to strive to become members of "Communist Labor Brigades." The Agakhonov team of the assembly workshop at the Kuibyshev Lathe Manufacturing Plant proposed to double their work efficiency within seven years, and they have already completed this year's production plan one month ahead of schedule.

Field work teams and livestock work teams of the Kalinin Collective Farm and the Zhdanov Collective Farm in Stalingrad Oblast have also launched a competition to become Communist Labor Brigades. The Volkova livestock work team proposed a guarantee of producing 5,000 kilograms of milk per dairy cow and decided that the work team would sow pasture grass themselves next spring, actively participating in the preparation of feed. In addition, they called on the youth of nearby collective farms to develop river滩land with them and strive to have all members reach a tenth-grade cultural level within two to three years.

Seventy-nine higher education institutions in Moscow Oblast recently held a congress, at which it was decided to launch a movement in various schools to strive to become "Communist Labor Classes." Participants in the competition must not only study well but also actively participate in labor and social work. At the meeting, someone suggested that the construction work of 26 of the 35 vegetable state farms in Moscow Oblast should be undertaken by the Communist Youth League members of higher education institutions.

Fourth-year students of the metallurgy department of the Leningrad Institute of Technology decided to establish regular contact with a steel rolling workshop in a steel plant. In addition to working with the workers to master a new type of steel rolling operation technology, they also want to organize recreational activities with them. (Attached picture)

    苏维埃人争作共产主义劳动队战士
    各地工厂农庄集会誓师  高等学校学生擂鼓挑战
    新华社莫斯科11日电  建立“共产主义劳动队”运动正在苏联全国各地蓬勃开展，规模日益扩大。除工厂外，集体农庄、国营农场、学校也都纷纷响应“用共产主义精神来工作、学习和生活”的倡议，互相提出挑战。
    列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、古比雪夫等地许多工厂的工人们在集会上纷纷提出要争取成为“共产主义劳动队”队员的保证。古比雪夫车床制造厂装配车间阿加霍诺夫工作队提出要在七年内把工作效率再提高一倍，他们已经提前一个月完成了今年的生产计划。
    斯大林格勒州的加里宁集体农庄和日丹诺夫集体农庄的田间工作队和畜牧工作队之间也展开了争取成为共产主义劳动队的竞赛。沃尔科娃畜牧工作队提出了每头乳牛产奶五千公斤的保证，并且决定在明春由工作队自己播种牧草，积极参加饲料的准备工作。此外，他们还号召附近集体农庄的青年和他们一起开发河滩地，并争取两三年内全部队员达到十年级文化水平。
    莫斯科州七十九个高等学校不久前举行了代表大会，会上决定在各校展开争取成为“共产主义劳动班”的运动。参加竞赛的人不仅要学习好，并且要积极参加劳动和社会工作。会上有人建议把莫斯科州三十五个蔬菜国营农场中的二十六个的建设工作由高等学校的共青团员来担任。
    列宁格勒工学院冶金系四年级学生决定与一个钢铁厂轧钢车间建立经常联系，除了要和工人共同劳动，掌握一种新式轧钢操作技术外，还要和他们一起组织文娱活动。（附图片）
