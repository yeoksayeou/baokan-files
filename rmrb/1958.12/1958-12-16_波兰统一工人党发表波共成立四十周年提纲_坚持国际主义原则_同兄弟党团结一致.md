Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 15th: Warsaw newspapers recently published the outline of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party regarding the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Communist Party.

    The outline discussed the environment in which the Polish Communist Party was born, the Polish Communist Party's struggle against the anti-people policies of the propertied classes, the Polish Communist Party's struggle to win the worker-peasant alliance, to win the anti-fascist national front, and against fascist dictatorship.

    The outline also talked about the dissolution of the Polish Communist Party, pointing out that the Central Committees of the five Communist and Workers' Parties had already confirmed in their resolution of February 19, 1956, that the dissolution of the Polish Communist Party was unjustified and based on untrue accusations. Therefore, the reputation of the great party was restored.

    The outline went on to say that after the party was dissolved, the Polish Communists did not lay down their arms, but continued to fight for the interests of the working class and all the people. Polish Communists established the first underground fighting organizations during World War II. These organizations formed the Polish Workers' Party—the successor to the Polish Communist Party. The first secretaries of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party—Nowotko, Finder, Gomulka—and outstanding activists of the Polish Workers' Party—Bierut, Fornalska and others—emerged from the ranks of the active members of the Polish Communist Party.

    The final part of the outline said that the Polish United Workers' Party inherited the cause of the Polish Communist Party. It is worthy of being the successor to the Polish Communist Party. The United Workers' Party made a correct shift in its policies in a timely manner in 1956. The policies formulated by the Eighth Plenary Session can not only restore the trust of the masses in areas where it has been weakened, but also expand this trust to adapt to the new social tasks facing our country, and can create conditions to ensure our country's further smooth development towards socialism. The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session also created a basis for the Party to successfully combat the main danger of the workers' movement at this stage—modern revisionism. Modern revisionists undermine the principles of Marxism-Leninism, disarm the working class in the face of the bourgeoisie, and modern revisionists oppose the unity of the international communist movement and the unity of the socialist camp. The Party has strengthened its ranks in the struggle against revisionism and dogmatism. Ideological unity unites our Party with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp, as well as with all communist and workers' parties in the world. The Polish United Workers' Party has demonstrated this position by participating in the formulation of the Declaration of the Twelve Communist and Workers' Parties of the Moscow Conference in November 1957 and the Peace Manifesto, and by steadfastly implementing internationalist policies.

    波兰统一工人党发表波共成立四十周年提纲
    坚持国际主义原则  同兄弟党团结一致
    新华社华沙15日电  华沙各报不久以前发表了波兰统一工人党中央委员会关于波兰共产党成立四十周年的提纲。
    提纲谈到了波兰共产党诞生的环境、波兰共产党反对有产阶级反人民政策的斗争、波兰共产党争取工农联盟、争取反法西斯民族阵线和反对法西斯专政的斗争。
    提纲也谈到波兰共产党的解散，指出五国共产党和工人党中央委员会早在1956年2月19日的决议中已经确认，波兰共产党被解散是没有理由的，所依据的是不真实的控告。因此，恢复了伟大的党的名誉。
    提纲接着说，在党被解散以后，波兰共产党人并没有放下武器，而继续为工人阶级和全体人民的利益而斗争。波兰共产党人在第二次世界大战期间成立了第一批地下战斗组织。由这些组织组成了波兰工人党——波兰共产党的继承者。在波兰共产党积极分子的队伍中产生了波兰工人党中央委员会第一批书记——诺沃特科、芬德尔、哥穆尔卡和波兰工人党杰出的活动家——贝鲁特、弗尔纳尔斯卡等人。
    提纲最后一部分说，波兰统一工人党继承了波兰共产党的事业。它不愧为波兰共产党的继承者。统一工人党及时地在1956年对自己的政策作出了正确的转变。八中全会所拟定的政策不仅能恢复已受到了削弱的地方的群众的信任，而且可以扩大这种信任，使之适应于我国面临的新的社会任务，并可以创造条件，保证我国进一步顺利地向社会主义发展。八中全会的决议还为党顺利地同现阶段工人运动的主要危险——现代修正主义进行斗争创造了基础。现代修正主义者破坏着马克思列宁主义的原则，使工人阶级在资产阶级面前被解除了武装，现代修正主义者反对国际共产主义运动的团结和社会主义阵营的团结。党在同修正主义和教条主义的斗争中加强了自己的队伍。思想上的团结一致把我们党同苏联共产党和社会主义阵营各国以及全世界所有的共产党和工人党团结在一起。波兰统一工人党通过参加拟定1957年11月莫斯科会议十二国共产党和工人党宣言及和平宣言以及坚持不渝地执行国际主义政策证明了这种立场。
