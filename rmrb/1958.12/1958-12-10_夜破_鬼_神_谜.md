　　That evening, Zhangshan Township, Lai'an County, Anhui Province, set up a "ring" to debate the existence or non-existence of gods. Participants in the debate included atheists, superstitious old men who had spent most of their lives praying to gods, as well as witches, incense masters, feng shui masters, and fortune-tellers.

　　Liu Xueyou, a middle-aged farmer in his thirties, whose wife had been ill in the past, consulted an incense master, spending seven or eight shi of rice without getting better. At this time, he said indignantly: "There are no ghosts or gods in the world, they are all just swindlers."

　　Mentioning that there were no ghosts or gods in the world sparked a debate. At this time, someone retorted: "Not necessarily, if there are no ghosts and gods, how can people sometimes get lost at night, and fall into pits? Where does the will-o'-the-wisp come from?"

　　The matter of getting lost by ghosts stumped many people. Yes, if there are no ghosts and gods, how can ghost迷路 happen? Among those attending the meeting tonight, some had gotten lost at night in the past. What exactly is the reason for this? Everyone was thinking.

　　Liu Jinsheng had also gotten lost in the past and always thought it was a ghost that led him astray, but after learning philosophy, he realized that people are also material, and after a person dies, there is only a pile of bones left, and there are no ghosts at all, so how can there be ghost迷路! Using a dialectical materialist point of view, he scientifically analyzed the cause of so-called ghost迷路: "When a person walks at night, if they are superstitious about ghosts and gods, when they walk to a cemetery or a deserted mountain forest, they will be frightened, goosebumps all over their body, as if there is a ghost blocking them in front, and a god staring at them from behind. The more nervous they become, the more confused their minds become, and in the end, they become dazed, unable to distinguish east, west, north, and south, running around randomly. When they run, their footsteps and clothes rustle, like ghosts and gods chasing them. In this way, some people fall into deep ditches and drown, and some are scared to death. If you squat down and calm down, your mind will be clear, and you won't get lost. The old saying is right: 'Afraid of water in the distance, afraid of ghosts up close'. When people go to unfamiliar places, not knowing where people have died or where the graves are, they are not afraid of walking at night at all. Carrying a load and chanting ?唷?唷, too tired to think about ghosts and gods, they are not afraid of walking at night either. We only hear about ghosts, but who has really seen a ghost? Isn't it just people spreading rumors and talking nonsense? The will-o'-the-wisp is not the fire of ghosts either, it is the phosphorus that is decomposed from the bones of dead people and animals such as dogs, cats, and donkeys after being exposed to wind and sun. It can emit light and float with the wind, so everyone calls it will-o'-the-wisp, which sounds quite scary."

　　"Ghosts and gods are fake, they were used by landlords in the past to paralyze us working people." Jiang Zemin related the discussion of ghosts to class relations. "In the past, landlords said that there were ghosts and gods, that they had houses and land because their ancestors had good feng shui, and it was their destiny to live off rent, saying that we had a poor life and deserved to be poor, and that we should be content with our lot, otherwise we would suffer in the eighteenth level of hell after death. Many people fell for their ghosts, and followed them in praying to gods and worshiping Buddha. I used to believe in ghosts and gods, burning incense and candles and paper money after my father died, spending a lot of money, hoping that he would bless me to get rich in the underworld, but it didn't work at all, and I was still poor every year. After liberation, my life suddenly got better, but the landlords were finished. Was it that the feng shui of their ancestors suddenly deteriorated? Were they suddenly out of luck? That's not the case at all, didn't the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead us to turn over, and all of us poor people became 'lucky' and our 'fate' suddenly got better! Since then, I no longer believe in ghosts and gods. People write 'Good luck shines' on their chimneys, and I write 'Long live Chairman Mao' on mine."

　　At this time, Zhang Yueshan chimed in with a joke. Last June, a family in the village got sick and asked ghost-woman Li Laotai to descend the spirit. He heard that she was descending the spirit, so he went over to take a look. When he went in, Li Laotai's "spirit" had not yet possessed her, and she was yawning and stretching. He sat down in front of the crowd. Li Laotai glanced at him, yawned again and again, stretched once and then again, yawning until she had snot and tears, her eyes turned white, but the spirit would not descend. At this time, someone next to him quietly nudged Zhang Yueshan with his hand and said: "You are wearing a cadre uniform, Li Laotai's spirit dares not come, you go out!" As soon as he walked out of the gate, Li Laotai wailed and sang, the ghost came, and the god came.

　　Zhang Yueshan's words made many people laugh. Just then, Chen Wencai, who had been sitting there peacefully, suddenly leaned back, his eyes turned white, his whole body trembled, waving his fists and kicking his legs, like a madman. What's going on? Is it a ghost or god coming to punish someone? Everyone was startled and looked at him. They saw him yawning repeatedly, muttering to himself, suddenly shouting loudly: "I'll tell you so you understand, I speak clearly on every road I've traveled. If you want your family's patient to get better, my Yellow Flower Maiden will arrive! Ha!" Another yawn, "I'll tell you so you understand, you must remember clearly on every road I've traveled. Rub three feet of peach-red cloth, buy four feet of red silk satin, weigh a big handful of sandalwood, buy twenty catties of good incense. I guarantee your family's patient will get better, don't forget the bitter feelings of my maiden! He...ya...!" He stretched again. Everyone heard this and knew that he was also "descending the spirit", and immediately burst into laughter, the feng shui master, incense master, ghost-woman, and fortune-teller also laughed non-stop; Chen Wencai himself also laughed. When the laughter subsided slightly, Chen Wencai smiled and asked the incense master Liu Jinyuan: "Old man Liu, your usual spirit-descending is all the same old routine, even I have learned it. How well did I descend the spirit?"

　　Liu Jinyuan lowered his head, said nothing, and his face was very embarrassed. Young woman Ye Shuhua then chimed in and said: "What spirit-descending, it's all just deceptive tricks. My mother is a witch, and she was asked to see my sister's nine-year-old daughter when she got sick. She begged and begged and messed around, and watched the child die. If there really are gods, wouldn't they show their divine power to bless their own niece? My sister is sad and resentful of the old woman when she mentions this." Incense master Liu Jinyuan also spoke. His voice was very low, but very agitated: "I have been an incense master for more than twenty years, relying on descending the spirit and playing tricks, eating and drinking outside, harming many people! To be honest, where are there any real ghosts and gods? Ghosts and gods come from my mouth. I myself am a witch god, if there really is a god, my eyes would not be blind. I 'treat' people's illnesses, relying entirely on luck. Some illnesses are not serious to begin with and will get better on their own. I go and move my hands, and if they get better, people think that I cured them. In this way, my reputation spreads, and everyone comes to ask me to cure them. But I really can't see a doctor! Once, Gao Qiyou in the village was sick and asked me to see him. I descended the spirit, but where did the spirit come from? I guessed that his brother Gao Qifu had been in the north for more than three years without news, and must have died, so I made up a story and said: 'Gao Qiyou, your brother was killed when he withdrew north. He has no money to spend, and his ghost came back to possess you to ask for money. Burn some paper money for him and he will get better.' Later, Gao Qifu came back alive and confronted me in person! Some people have eye problems, and I blow air on them, saying it is immortal air; three yawns and I claim to have descended the spirit, all these are deceptive tricks. In the old society, I was so poor that I had no choice but to pretend to be a ghost to feed myself. Now that our lives are getting better, I will never do that kind of deceptive business again."

　　"Descending the spirit is fake, and our fortune-telling is also fake," said fortune-teller Zhang Yulong with a smile: "Today I am going to open the skylight and speak honestly. We people who make a living in this line, when we walk into someone's house, our ears are like copper bells, relying on listening and also relying on the guide to inquire. When we walk into the houses of people with high thresholds and big houses, we praise them, saying that they have a rich and noble life; when we walk into thatched huts, we say that they have a poor life and bad luck. ..." Ye Shuhua then interjected and asked: "You are quite capable. Once you told my fortune, you kept saying good things at the beginning, but later I asked you: 'According to my fortune, what is the relationship between my husband and wife?' When you heard my tone, you quickly changed your words and said: 'The relationship between husband and wife is not good, if you don't go to the township, you will go to the district, if you don't go to the district, you will go to court.'" Zhang Yulong still said with a smile: "That's called a blind man telling lies. When you mentioned that, I estimated that your husband and wife must not get along; if the relationship between husband and wife is good, why would you ask whether the relationship between husband and wife is good? So I made up a lot of nonsense." After a pause, he said firmly: "Now we blind people have guarantees for life, old age, sickness, and death, who would be willing to do the old business of superstition? I will bring the clapperboard for exhibition tomorrow."

　　At the end of the debate, the comrades in the township also conducted a biogas experiment on the spot. When the gasoline lamp was moved outside, and the room was dark, a glistening green fire immediately emerged from an oilcloth bag, looking like a "will-o'-the-wisp" from a distance. Everyone scrambled to watch. The comrades in the township connected biogas to philosophy, telling everyone that everything in the world is material, and that the so-called "will-o'-the-wisp" is also like biogas, a material thing, but it is phosphorus fire. Some people watched the biogas experiment and suddenly realized: "It turns out that a gas can also emit green light, no wonder philosophy says that everything in the world is material. Of course, the 'will-o'-the-wisp' must also be material, it will not be the light emitted by ghosts and gods. It is 'god' eliminating 'ghost'."

    夜破“鬼”“神”谜
    黄根亭
    这天晚上，安徽来安县张山乡摆了一个“擂台”，辩论有神无神的问题。参加辩论的，有无神论者，有大半辈子求神拜佛的迷信老头，还有巫婆、香头、阴阳先生和算命先生等。
    刘学友，一个三十多岁的中年农民，他老婆过去有病，请香头瞧，花了七、八石米没治好。这时他愤愤地说：“天下那有鬼神，还不都是骗人的。”
    一提起天下没有鬼神，可引起争论来了。这时候有人反问道：“不见得吧，若说没鬼神，晚上一个人走路，怎么有时会被鬼迷住，陷到坑里去的呢？鬼火那来的呢？”
    鬼迷路的事，可把许多人问住了。是呀，没有鬼神，怎么会发生鬼迷路的呢？今晚参加会的人当中，就有人在过去晚上迷过路。这到底是什么原因呢？大家都在思量着。
    刘金生过去也迷过路，也总以为是鬼迷路，可是学了哲学之后，他认清了人也是物质的，人死之后剩摊骨头，根本没有鬼魂，那有什么鬼迷路呢！他用辩证唯物主义观点，很科学地分析了所谓鬼迷路的原因：“一个人夜里走路，如果迷信鬼神，走到坟墓地和荒山野林，就会心惊肉跳，浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，好似前头有鬼挡，后头有神盯，愈紧张脑子愈发昏，到末了就迷迷糊糊地，连东西南北也分不清了，到处乱跑，一跑脚步和身上的衣服就哗哗响，像鬼神在追。就这样有的人陷到深沟里淹死，有的人吓死。要是蹲下来定定神，头脑就清醒了，路也不迷了。老古话讲得对：‘远处怕水，近处怕鬼’，人到陌生地方，不晓得那里死过人，那里是坟墓走夜路就一点不怕。挑一担走路?唷?唷喊，累得顾不上想鬼神，走夜路也不怕。光听说有鬼，可是谁真看到鬼呢，还不是人传人，胡说八道。鬼火也不是鬼的火，那是人和狗、猫、驴等动物死后，风吹日晒，骨头内化出来的磷，能发光，随风飘，大家就管它叫鬼火，说得怪吓人的。”
      “鬼神是假的，那是过去地主麻痹我们劳动人民的。”蒋泽民联系到阶级关系来谈鬼了。“过去地主说有鬼神，说他们有房有地是祖上风水好，命里注定吃租子，说我们是穷命，活该受穷，要安分守己，不然死后打下十八层地狱受苦。好多人上了他们鬼当，也跟着他们求神拜佛。我原来也信鬼神的，父亲死后烧香点烛又烧纸，花费好多钱，盼望他老人家在阴间保佑我发财，可是一点也不灵，我还是一直年年混穷。解放后，我生活一下好起来了，地主却完蛋了，这难道是他们祖上的风水，突然变坏了吗？是他们一下倒运了吗？那才不会哩，还不是共产党毛主席领导我们翻了身，我们穷人才统统交上‘鸿运’，‘命’一下变好了！打这我再不信鬼神了。人家烟囱上写‘吉星高照’，我家写‘毛主席万岁’。”
    这时候张跃山插上来讲了件笑话。去年6月里，村上有家人家生病，请鬼姑子李老太下神。他听说正在下神，就走过去瞧瞧。进去时，李老太的“神”还没附身，正在打哈欠伸腰。他就朝人群前一坐。李老太的眼向他一瞟，一个哈欠又一个哈欠，伸了一次腰又伸一次腰，直哈得又是鼻涕又是眼泪，眼睛发白，总是不下神。这时旁边的人用手悄悄捣捣张跃山说：“你穿的是干部制服，李老太的神不敢来了，你出去吧！”他刚走出大门，后边李老太就哇啦哇啦唱起来，鬼也来了，神也来了。
    张跃山的话，引得好多人都笑了。正在这时，原来好端端坐在那里的陈文才，突然向后一仰，眼睛发白，浑身发抖，幌拳伸腿，好像疯子。这是怎么回事？是鬼神来整人吗？大家顿时一惊，眼睛都看向他。只见他连打哈欠，口中念念有词，一忽儿大叫一声：“对你讲来对你明，行行路路说得清，要得你家病人好，我黄花姑娘到来临！哈！”又是一个哈欠，“对你讲来对你明，行行路路你要记清，搓上三尺桃红布，买上四尺红绸绫，檀香称上一大把，好香买它二十斤。保得你家病人好，莫忘我姑娘苦心情！呵……呀……！”又伸了一个懒腰。大家听到这里，才知道他也在“下神”，立即哄堂大笑，阴阳先生、香头、鬼姑子和算命先生也大笑不止；陈文才自己也笑了。笑声稍低时，陈文才向香头刘金元笑问道：“刘老头，你以往下神都老一套，连我都学会了，我下神下得可像？”
    刘金元低着头，不作声，脸色很尴尬。青年妇女叶书华这时接上说：“什么下神呀，尽是些骗人的把戏。我母亲是巫婆，我姊姊的九岁女儿生了病叫她瞧。她七求八求地尽胡摆弄，眼睁睁把小孩拖死了。要说真有神，自己的外甥女还有不显神通保佑的吗？我姊姊提起这件事就伤心，怨恨老太婆。”香头刘金元也说话了。声音很低沉，但很激动：“我当了二十多年香头，靠下神弄鬼，在外头混吃混喝，害了不少人！说老实话，那里真有什么鬼神呢，鬼神由我口里出。我自己是巫神，要是真有神，我的一双眼也不会瞎了。我给人‘治’病，全靠碰运气，有的病本来不厉害，自己会好，我去动动手，好了，人家就以为是我治好的。这样名气就传出去了，大家都来请我治。其实我那会真正看病呀！有一次村上高其友有病，叫我去瞧。我下神了，可是那来神呢？我估量他哥哥高其富北上三年多没音讯，一定是死了，就胡诌说：‘高其友呀，你的哥哥北撤时打死了，没钱用，鬼魂回来附你身上要钱用，烧点纸钱给他病就好了。’后来，高其富活着回来了，当面顶了我一家伙！有人害眼睛，我用口气吹吹，说是仙气；三个哈欠一打，算是下神了，这尽是骗人的玩意。旧社会内穷得没办法，我装神弄鬼糊嘴，如今我们日子都好过了，我再也不干那种骗人的行当了。”
    “下神是假的，我们算命也是假的。”算命先生张玉龙笑着说：“今天我来揭开天窗讲亮话。吃我们这行饭的，走进人家门，两耳像铜铃，要靠耳听，还要靠引路的探听。走到门槛高、房子大的人家，我们就捧捧他们，说他们是富贵命；走进茅草屋，我们就说他们是穷命，运不好。……”叶书华这时插问说：“你是怪能的。有次你给我算命，开头尽讲好话，后来我问你：‘照我命里推算，我们夫妻关系怎样？’你一听我口气，连忙改口说：‘夫妻关系搞不好，不进乡里到区里，不到区里进法院。’”张玉龙还是笑着说：“这就叫瞎子讲瞎话。你那样一提，我就估计你们夫妻一定合不来；如果夫妻关系好好的，怎么会提出夫妻关系好不好呢？我就胡诌一通。”停顿了一下，他坚决地说：“如今我们瞎子生老病死有保障，谁还愿意去干迷信的旧营生呢？我明天把叮当板送来展览。”
    在辩论会结束的时候，乡里同志还当场做了一次沼气试验。当汽油灯移到外面，屋子里黑漆漆的时候，从一个油布袋内，立即冒出了莹莹的绿火，远看活像是“鬼火”。大家争着观看。乡里的同志从沼气联系到哲学，告诉大家世界上一切都是物质的，所谓“鬼火”也像沼气一样，是物质的东西，不过那是磷火罢了。有的人看了沼气试验，恍然大悟地说：“原来一股气也能发绿光，难怪哲学上说世界上所有的东西，都是物质的。当然‘鬼火’也一定是物质了，不会是鬼神发光。是‘神’消‘鬼’灭。”
