    Cleaning Can Also Create Wealth
    Yin Asu, Cleaning Worker, Yimiao District, Shanghai

    Before liberation, I was already a cleaning worker. When I was seven, my father died, and we didn't have money for the burial. My mother arranged my engagement, using the betrothal gifts for the funeral expenses. At eight, I became a child bride. Unable to endure the beatings and scolding from my in-laws, I ran back to my mother's house three times. My mother couldn't afford to keep me, so a neighbor introduced me to work as a servant for six years of hardship. I got married at sixteen, without bedding or clothes. At seventeen, my father-in-law died, and we had no money for the burial, so we had to sell the house and land, leaving us with no place to live. So, I came to Shanghai to make a living by emptying chamber pots. I looked down on my own job, but I couldn't find any other work. My husband and I only made eight yuan a month, and life was very difficult. It wasn't until the Communist Party came that we were liberated.

    In the past, people looked down on us cleaning workers, calling us dirty and smelly chamber pot emptiers. Now, after liberation, we have truly become cleaning workers.

    I believe that cleaning workers should not only do a good job of cleaning but can also create wealth for the country. In 1949, I switched from using tap water to using Huangpu River water to wash the manure wharves. Everyone followed my example, saving the state thirty yuan in water bills each month. In 1951, when the Party called on us to collect fertilizer for the countryside, we cleaning workers responded enthusiastically, no longer dumping manure into the Huangpu River. This not only provided fertilizer for the countryside but also cleaned up the Huangpu River water. This year, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions called on all workers in the city to strive to increase national accumulation by ten billion yuan. We cleaning workers in Shanghai proposed a target of accumulating 10,000 taels of gold for the country. Cleaning workers at our station have made guarantees to accumulate one and a half taels of gold per person, striving for two taels. I realized that to complete this task, we must rely on the efforts of residents. I often publicized the importance of fertilizer accumulation to residents, mobilizing them to pour their children's excrement into chamber pots instead of into the sewers, and collecting the water used to flush chamber pots. This not only produced more manure but also improved environmental hygiene. When setting production plans this year, many comrades only set a target of thirty cartloads per month. I proposed exceeding that by fifty cartloads per month. People asked me, "How are you going to do it?" My method was to find manure everywhere. In addition to emptying chamber pots for the residents of the neighborhood, I also went to the Baxianqiao farmers' market and the Great World amusement park to get manure. I left early and came back late every day, exceeding my quota by sixty-seven cartloads in half a month. When I spoke at the National Youth Workers Congress, I also made a guarantee that, in addition to completing the annual production target, I would exceed it by 1,800 cartloads (which would increase national production by 1,170 yuan), increasing my daily target from the original four cartloads to ten cartloads. In fact, on the first day of the Great Leap Forward, I completed fourteen cartloads. In August this year, I was injured in the foot and rested for sixteen days. After recovering, I thought I must make up for the tasks missed during my leave. Therefore, I tried to do as many cartloads as possible every day, doing as many as twenty-five cartloads in one day. In fourteen days, I not only made up for the tasks missed during my sixteen days of leave but also exceeded my quota by sixty cartloads. When the leaders found out, they were afraid I was too tired and didn't allow me to do that.

    I deeply appreciate the Party's care for us workers. In the past, we cleaning workers drank raw water; after liberation, the Party installed two hot water barrels for us at the wharf so that the workers could have hot tea at any time. I always left two hours early every day. After pushing the first cartload to the manure wharf, I would start the stove and boil water, so that other comrades could have hot tea when they arrived. I also bought towels and soap so that cleaning workers could wash their faces at the wharf. When I saw that workers had forgotten their clothes at the wharf, I would collect them for them. If they were torn, I would help them mend them; if they were dirty, I would help them wash them. Therefore, they all affectionately called me "Auntie." I deeply feel that we are living a socialist life, brought to us by Chairman Mao. I now love my job very much. I am determined to do it to the end and make even greater achievements!

    清洁工作也能创造财富
    上海市邑庙区清洁工人  殷阿素
    我在解放以前就是个清洁工人，七岁时我父亲死了，没有安葬费，我娘就给我订了婚，把聘礼做了安葬费。我八岁那年就做了童养媳。受不了公婆的打骂，逃回娘家三次。我娘养不起我，由邻居介绍我给人家当小佣人，吃了六年苦。十六岁结婚，没有被头没有衣服。十七岁时公公又死了，没有安葬费，只得把房地变卖，住处也没有了。于是来到上海倒马桶谋生。我自己看不起自己的工作，但是别的工作又找不到，夫妻二人每月只有八块钱，生活非常苦。直到共产党来了，我们才翻了身。
    过去人家看不起我们清洁工人，叫我们又脏又臭的倒马桶的。现在解放了，我们才名副其实地成为清洁工人了。
    我觉得，清洁工人不仅应该首先做好清洁工作，而且也可以为国家创造财富。1949年，我不用自来水而改用黄浦江水来刷洗粪码头，大家都照我这办法做了，每月就给国家节约了水费三十元。1951年，党提出要为农村积肥，我们清洁工人热烈响应，不再把粪倒在黄浦江里，这样不仅给农村积了肥，而且使黄浦江水都清洁了。今年，上海市工联号召全市职工为国家再增加积累十亿元而努力，我们上海市清洁工人就提出为国家积累一万两黄金的指标。我们站清洁工人纷纷提出保证，每人要积累一两半黄金，力争二两。我认识到要完成这个任务，必须要依靠居民一起努力，就经常向居民宣传积肥的重要性，动员她们把孩子的大便倒在马桶里，不要倒在阴沟里，并向居民收回冲马桶的粪水。这样不仅可以多出粪，还改善了环境卫生。在今年订增产计划时，许多同志只订每月三十车，我提出每月超额五十车。人家问我：“你有什么办法呢？”我的办法是到各方面去找粪，除了为里弄居民倒马桶外，我又去八仙桥小菜场，大世界游乐场出粪。每天早出车，迟回来，半个月里就超额了六十七车。我在全国青工代表大会上发言时，又提出保证，在完成全年生产指标外，还要超额完成一千八百车（可为国家增产一千一百七十元），每天从原来四车的指标，跃进到十车。实际上大跃进开始的第一天我就完成了十四车。今年8月，我因脚受伤休息了十六天，病好后，我想我一定要补足休假期间所缺的任务，因此每天尽量多出车，最多的时候一天出二十五车。这样我在十四天里除补足了所缺的十六天休假期中的任务外，还超过了六十车。领导上知道后，恐怕我太疲劳，不许我这样做。
    我深深体会到党对我们工人的爱护。过去我们清洁工人吃的都是生水；解放以后，党为我们在码头上安置了两只开水桶，让工人们随时可以吃到热茶。我每天总是提早二个钟头出车，头一车推到粪码头后，就生起炉子，烧好开水，等其他同志来时就可以吃到热茶了。我还买了毛巾、肥皂，让清洁工人能在码头上洗脸。我看到工人们衣服忘记在码头上，就替他们收起，破了就帮他们补，脏了就帮他们洗，因此他们都亲热的喊我阿姨。我深深感到，我们过社会主义生活了，是毛主席带来的幸福，我现在非常喜爱我这个工作岗位，我决心干到底，并且要做出更大成绩来！
