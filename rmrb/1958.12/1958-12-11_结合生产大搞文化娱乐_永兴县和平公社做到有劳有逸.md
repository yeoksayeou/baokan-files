    Combining Production with Vigorously Developing Cultural Entertainment
    Peace Commune in Yongxing County Achieves a Balance of Work and Rest
    (Our dispatch) Changsha – The Peace People's Commune in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, has witnessed a surge in production enthusiasm and a vibrant cultural and entertainment scene, thanks to ensuring rest for its members during production labor.
    The Commune Party Committee, responding to the new demands of the masses after their living standards improved, arranged collective life and rest entertainment time for the masses, and established a system that closely integrates production with cultural and recreational activities.
    In the past two months of intensive labor, commune members have already watched two operas and one film. With a balance of work and rest, everyone is in good spirits, and a new atmosphere of enthusiastic production prevails everywhere. The fields are filled with the sound of gongs and drums, interspersed with bursts of joyful labor songs. Field blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, and local radio broadcasts are all readily available. On all fifteen ball courts in the commune, young commune members, having just put down their hoes, enthusiastically play basketball and volleyball during their rest time. In the evening, commune members have free time to rest. Some go to Red and Expert Universities with their books, while others go to reading rooms and libraries to read newspapers and books. The performers are busy rehearsing exciting programs. In a happy and rhythmic working life, although commune members work hard every day, they quickly eliminate fatigue. The commune has already exceeded its production target of sixty-five tons of pig iron, and crops have been harvested and planted in a timely manner. Now, commune members have投入 themselves into a new battle – water conservancy construction.

    结合生产大搞文化娱乐
    永兴县和平公社做到有劳有逸
    本报讯  湖南省永兴县和平人民公社在生产劳动中，由于保证了社员的休息，便出现了生产干劲高涨和文化娱乐活动丰富多彩的局面。
    公社党委会根据生活改善后群众的新要求，安排了群众的集体生活和休息娱乐时间，规定了紧密结合生产开展文化娱乐活动的制度。
    在最近两个月的紧张劳动中，社员们已看了两场戏和一场电影。由于有劳有逸，人人精神舒畅，到处是一片热热闹闹搞生产的新气象。田野里锣鼓喧天，间或送来一阵阵愉快的劳动歌声。田间黑板报、大字报、土广播，样样齐全。在全社十五个球场上，刚刚放下锄头的青年社员们，在休息时间兴致勃勃地打起篮排球。晚上，是社员们自由支配的休息时间。他们有挟着书本进红专大学的，也有到阅览室、图书馆看书报的，演员们却忙着在排演精彩的节目。在欢乐的有节奏的劳动生活中，尽管社员们每天劳动紧张，都很快消除了疲劳。全社六十五吨生铁生产任务已超额完成，农作物都及时收割和播种了。现在，社员们又投入了新的战斗——兴修水利。
