Comrade Liu Shaoqi Delivers a Speech on Behalf of the Party Central Committee

In 1958, we have already found a path for high-speed development of agricultural production and have begun to change the backward state of agricultural production. – 1959 is the decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and we must strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than this year. – In order to smoothly complete the tasks of 1959, and in order to strive to thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front in a relatively short period of time, we must always maintain high morale and soaring energy, and we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific spirit in all our work. – The victory of all our work is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and from the Party's working method of the mass line. – At present, the central task in rural areas is to conscientiously do a good job in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes in conjunction with winter production.

Comrades:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend warm congratulations to the national representative meeting of advanced units in agricultural socialist construction, and to all farmers and agricultural workers who have worked diligently on the agricultural front and achieved great victories.

In 1958, China's socialist construction experienced an all-round great leap forward on all fronts and set off a high tide of technical revolution and cultural revolution. The output of major products such as steel, machinery, coal, grain, and cotton all increased by one or more times in 1958 compared to 1957. Great achievements have also been made on the cultural, educational, and health fronts. In this year, the whole country quickly and smoothly realized the people's communes. In terms of water conservancy construction, relatively comprehensive and systematic water conservancy construction experience has been created, and it has paved the way for the comprehensive utilization of water resources and the complete solution of water and drought disasters in the future; many areas are currently able to overcome ordinary water and drought disasters. In agricultural production, a path for high-speed development of agricultural production has been found, and the backward state of agricultural production has begun to change, doubling the yields of grain, cotton, and other crops. Now, in our large country with a large population, the average person can have about 1,200 catties of grain per year, which cannot be regarded as a great achievement.

The achievements we have made in this year's great leap forward in industry and agriculture are the result of the victory of the Party's rectification campaign and anti-rightist struggle, the result of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the result of the unity and mutual assistance of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. It eloquently proves the great vitality and unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The more frantically the reactionary bourgeoisie of the imperialist countries attack the leap forward of China, the Soviet Union, and the entire socialist camp, the more it proves that our victory has indeed painfully hit them, making the whole world see that their future is becoming increasingly dim.

Our achievements are great. However, we must never be complacent because of this. The tasks ahead are still arduous and heavy. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which was convened not long ago, on the basis of comprehensively estimating and summarizing the great leap forward of 1958, formulated some major indicators for industrial and agricultural production in 1959, put forward the task of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, and put forward a grand vision for the future development of agricultural production. The resolution requires that China's agriculture should gradually realize the gardening of cultivation and the mechanization and electrification of the production process; strive to achieve an average of 2,000 to 3,000 catties of grain per capita per year in the country in a relatively short period of time; increase the proportion of oil crops, hemp, and other various cash crops in the total agricultural production; and strive to expand the production of meat, vegetables, and various non-staple foods; like on the industrial front, carry out a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front. There is no doubt that to complete the great tasks of 1959 and gradually turn the future vision into reality, the people of the whole country need to make persistent efforts and work hard. 1959 is the decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and we must strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 than this year.

In order to smoothly complete the tasks of 1959, and in order to strive to thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front in a relatively short period of time, we must continue to strengthen socialist and communist education among the broad masses of people, carry forward the communist style; continue to fight against all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts, and make people always maintain high morale and soaring energy. It must be seen that without the universal improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people, without the increasingly vigorous great revolutionary enthusiasm, it is impossible to guarantee the complete realization of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and it is impossible to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture at a faster speed.

Chairman Mao told us that in order to achieve our tasks, we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific spirit in all our work. Whether in the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, in the arrangement of production and the allocation of labor, in the popularization of new agricultural technologies and the implementation of tool reforms, we must conduct in-depth investigation and research, formulate practical plans, and formulate practical and feasible measures to make the work more and more meticulous. Soaring energy is not expressed in the indicators set only by subjective wishes, but in the real achievements obtained through practical work, hard work, and skillful work. Any exaggerated formalism is incompatible with the communist style and will only cause damage to our cause.

Some activists in the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene are also participating in this meeting. On the health front, significant achievements have also been made in 1958. But our arduous task is far from complete. The current task is to summarize and promote the successful experience of 1958, continue to carry out extensive mass movements, adhere to uniting all staff on the entire medical and health front, implement the policy of close integration of Chinese and Western medicine, close integration of specialized talents and the broad masses, and strive to eliminate the four pests in the next few years, gradually eliminate the diseases that are most harmful to the people, and greatly improve the level of our country's health undertakings.

Obviously, the victory of all our work is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and from the Party's working method of the mass line. The peasants say it well: "Of all the thousands of things, the leadership of the Party is the first; of all the thousands of plans, the mass line is the first plan." Representatives! You are advanced workers on the agricultural front, you are the backbone and activists of the people's communes, and you must deeply feel in your work that nothing can be accomplished without the leadership of the Party and without the masses at any time. People now know the importance of "politics in command." With "politics in command," the enthusiasm comes, and the methods are also available. And the so-called "politics in command" is essentially to adhere to the leadership of the Party, that is, to correctly implement the Party's mass line.

Now our cause is developing rapidly, and the work of the people's communes is more extensive and more complex than the work of agricultural production cooperatives. This requires everyone to better study the Party's guidelines and policies and correctly implement the Party's policies, and to more closely contact the broad masses. At present, the central task in rural areas is to conscientiously do a good job in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes in conjunction with winter production. When rectifying the communes, a high degree of democracy should be implemented, matters should be discussed with the masses, and the opinions of the masses should be listened to with an open mind. In order to run the people's communes well, the mass line must be thoroughly implemented. At the same time, as everyone knows, the people's communes are no longer just organizers of mass production, but also organizers of mass life. Therefore, we must not only rely on the masses to do a good job in production and complete other tasks, but also rely on the masses to conscientiously care about the lives of the masses, properly arrange the time for the masses' labor, study, rest, and entertainment, and strive to run the people's communes' canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and other various welfare undertakings well. This is also a noble and glorious task before us.

Representatives! Under the leadership of the Party, you have made great achievements in your respective work posts. I hope that in the future, you will not only strive to keep yourselves and your units advanced for a long time, but also strive to help others and other units catch up to the advanced level. The Party Central Committee believes that the comrades present today will certainly be able to work together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Party and the people, to continue to make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. I wish the comrades success in their future work! I wish the conference success!

    刘少奇同志代表党中央致词
    一九五八年，我们已经找到了一条高速度发展农业生产的道路，开始改变了农业生产落后的状况。——一九五九年是苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，我们必须争取实现比今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。——为了顺利地完成一九五九年的任务，为了争取在一个较短的时期内彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌，必须永远保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲，必须在任何工作中把革命热情和科学精神结合起来。——我们的一切工作的胜利都离不开党的领导，离不开党的群众路线的工作方法。——目前在农村中的中心任务是结合冬季生产，认真地做好人民公社的整顿和巩固工作。同志们：
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会，向全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，向在农业战线上辛勤劳动、获得了伟大胜利的全体农民和农业工作者，致以热烈的祝贺。
    1958年，我国的社会主义建设，在各个战线上都出现了全面的大跃进，并且掀起了一个技术革命和文化革命的高潮。全国钢铁、机械、煤炭、粮食、棉花等主要产品的产量，1958年比1957年都增长了一倍或一倍以上。在文化教育卫生战线上，也得到了巨大的成就。在这一年里，全国农村迅速地顺利地实现了人民公社化。在水利建设方面，已经创造了比较全面的系统的水利建设经验，并且为今后综合利用水利资源、彻底解决水旱灾害开辟了道路；许多地区目前就已经能够克服普通的水旱灾害。在农业生产上，已经找到了一条高速度发展农业生产的道路，开始改变了农业生产落后的状况，使粮食、棉花和其他一些农作物的产量成倍地增长。现在，在我们这样一个人口众多的大国，全年每口人平均可以有一千二百斤左右粮食，这不能不认为是一个伟大的成就。
    我们在今年的工农业大跃进中所取得的成就，是党的整风运动和反右派斗争胜利的成果，是贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的成果，是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国团结互助的成果。它雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。帝国主义国家的反动资产阶级愈是疯狂地攻击中国、苏联和整个社会主义阵营的跃进，就愈证明我们的胜利的确狠狠地打痛了他们，使全世界都看到他们的前途是愈来愈暗淡了。
    我们的成绩是伟大的。但是，我们绝不能因此自满。今后的任务还是艰巨的，繁重的。不久前召开的党的八届六中全会，在全面地估计和总结1958年的大跃进的基础上，拟订了1959年工农业生产的一些主要指标，提出了整顿和巩固人民公社的任务，并且对今后农业生产的发展提出了一个宏伟的远景。决议要求：我国的农业，要逐步地实现耕作的园田化和生产过程的机械化、电气化；要争取在一个较短的时期内，做到每年全国平均每口人有两千斤至三千斤粮食；要更多地增加油料、麻类和其他各种经济作物在全部农业生产中的比重，努力扩大肉类、蔬菜和各种副食品的生产；要像在工业战线上一样，在农林牧副渔五业中实行全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。毫无疑问，要完成1959年的伟大任务，并且把将来的远景逐步变为现实，还需要全国人民再接再厉，顽强努力。1959年是苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，我们必须争取在1959年实现比今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    为了顺利地完成1959年的任务，为了争取在一个较短的时期内彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌，必须在广大人民群众中，继续加强社会主义和共产主义教育，发扬共产主义风格；继续同形形色色的右倾保守思想进行斗争，使人们永远保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲。必须看到，没有广大人民群众政治觉悟的普遍提高，没有日益蓬勃发展的伟大的革命热情，要保证完满地实现党的社会主义建设总路线，要用较快的速度把我国建设成为一个有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，是不可能的。
    毛主席告诉我们，为了实现我们的任务，必须在任何工作中把革命热情和科学精神结合起来。不论在整顿和巩固人民公社的工作上，在生产的安排和劳动力的调配上，在推广新的农业技术和实行工具改革的工作上，我们都必须进行深入的调查研究，制订合乎实际的计划，规定切实可行的措施，使工作愈做愈细致。冲天的干劲并不表现在只凭主观愿望所定出来的指标上，而是表现在经过实干、苦干、巧干所取得的真实成就上。任何浮夸的形式主义作风，都是同共产主义风格不相容的，对于我们的事业只会造成损害。
    参加这次会议的，还有一部分除四害、讲卫生运动中的积极分子。在卫生战线上，1958年也取得了重大的成就。但是我们的艰巨任务还远没有完成。当前的任务，就是要总结和推广1958年的成功经验，继续开展广泛的群众运动，坚持团结整个医药卫生战线上的全体工作人员，贯彻执行中西医密切结合、专门人才和广大群众密切结合的方针，争取在最近几年内，除尽四害，逐步消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，把我国卫生事业的水平大大提高一步。
    很明显，我们的一切工作的胜利都离不开党的领导，离不开党的群众路线的工作方法。农民们说得好：“千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千计万计，群众路线是第一计”。各位代表！你们是农业战线上的先进工作者，你们是人民公社的骨干和积极分子，你们在工作中一定深切地感到，不论任何时候，离开了党的领导，离开了群众，就将一事无成。人们现在都知道“政治挂帅”的重要，有了“政治挂帅”，干劲就来了，办法也有了。而所谓“政治挂帅”，实质上就是坚持党的领导，就是要正确地实行党的群众路线。
    现在我们的事业正一日千里地在发展着，人民公社的工作比农业生产合作社的工作是更加广泛、更加复杂了。这就要求大家更好地学习党的方针路线和正确地执行党的政策，更密切地联系广大群众。目前在农村中的中心任务是结合冬季生产，认真地做好人民公社的整顿和巩固工作。在进行整社的时候，应该实行高度的民主，遇事同群众商量，虚心听取群众的意见。为了办好人民公社，就要彻底地执行群众路线。同时，大家知道，人民公社已经不只是群众生产的组织者，它还是群众生活的组织者。因此，我们不但要依靠群众来搞好生产和完成其他各项任务，并且要依靠群众认真地关心群众的生活，妥善地安排群众的劳动、学习、休息和娱乐的时间，努力把人民公社的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院和其他各种福利事业办好。这同样是摆在我们面前的崇高的、光荣的任务。
    各位代表！在党的领导下，你们在自己的工作岗位上，已经作出了很大的成绩。希望你们今后不仅要努力使自己和自己的单位长久地保持先进的称号，而且要努力帮助别人和别的单位赶上先进的水平。党中央相信，今天到会的同志们，一定能够同全国人民一道，在党的领导下，在党和人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，继续对祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献。祝同志们今后工作胜利！祝大会成功！
