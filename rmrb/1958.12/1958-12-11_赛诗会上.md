    Poetry Contest
    Pan Wuyi
    November 22nd was the rest day for the Tiancun station of the Beijing Sijiqing People's Commune. The girls put on their floral cotton jackets and rode their bicycles to New Beijing to play; the cooks were making dumplings for the commune members; the village Pingju opera troupe was busy rehearsing the play to be performed at the gala under the sunlight, and the courtyard was filled with the sounds of erhu and gongs and drums.

    This village is a village of poetry. They decided to hold a poetry contest on the holiday. On the first day of the holiday, Comrade Meng Zhaobin, the Propaganda Committee member of the station's Party General Branch, announced the news to everyone through the radio. The masses were in a frenzy, everyone was writing poetry. The feeder sang poetry while feeding the livestock, and the steelmaking expert was writing poetry. Late at night, the Propaganda Committee member ran home and saw his wife still leaning on the head of the bed pondering the poem she had just finished:
      "The door to learning opens,
    	Laughter fills our hearts,
    	We have learned it,
    	Bringing others along."

    His wife, Liu Xiuqing, had just shed her illiteracy label, and now she had also fallen in love with poetry. These two had become poets, and whenever they had a moment, Lao Meng would always take out the small notebook from his pocket and write down three or two poems.

    In the evening, the poetry contest officially began. Before it was completely dark, the venue was crowded with people, including cooks, police officers, barbers, tractor drivers, feeders, girls who opened electric wells, teachers and students, naughty children from the kindergarten, and energetic old men and women in their sixties and seventies. They were happily waiting for their poets to take the stage.

    The stage was brightly lit. Suddenly, the whole audience was silent. Our poets came out. Commune member Du Wenbin recited a poem praising the whole people's steelmaking to the audience:
      "The bellows can refine ten thousand tons of steel,
    	One hammer strikes down a thousand catties of grain;
    	Working in shifts day and night to produce more,
    	We laughingly treat the moon as the sun."

    After Aunt Hu's daughter-in-law, Li Ronghua, recited a poem praising the goodness of the People's Commune, the aunt couldn't restrain her excitement and ran onto the stage, spontaneously reciting a newly composed poem to everyone:
    Who says I can't sing songs,
    Who says I can't be a singer,
    As long as everyone opens their mouths,
    Leap forward songs will resound in all directions.
    Women used to suffer,
    Trampled on and bullied by everyone,
    The Communist Party came to liberate us,
    It is our own dear mother.

    赛诗会上     
    潘武一
    11月22日，这天是北京四季青人民公社田村站的公休日。姑娘们穿起花棉袄，骑着自行车到新北京去玩；炊事员正在给社员包饺子；村的评剧团，在阳光下忙着赶排联欢会上要演的戏，院子里传来一阵阵二胡和锣鼓的合奏。
    这个村是一个诗歌之村。他们决定要在假日开一个赛诗会。假日的头一天，站的党总支宣委孟召斌同志，通过广播把这个消息告诉了大家。群众沸腾了，人人做诗。饲养员一边喂牲口，一边唱着诗，炼钢能手在做诗。深夜宣委跑回家，看见他的爱人还靠在床头上琢磨着她才刚写完的诗：
      “学习大门开，
    嘻笑满心怀，
    我们学会了，
    带着别人来。”
    他的爱人刘秀清才摘掉文盲帽子，现在也爱上了诗，这两口子都成了诗人，只要一有空老孟总是把袋里的小本本拿出来，写上个三两首。
    晚上，赛诗会正式开始了。天还没有黑尽，会场上就挤满了人群，他们之中有炊事员，有民警，有理发员，有拖拉机手，有饲养员，有开电井的姑娘，有教师和学生，有幼儿院的淘气的孩子，也有精神奕奕的六七十岁的大爷大娘。他们欢欢喜喜地等待着自己的诗人出场。
    舞台上灯火辉煌。突然，全场肃静。咱们的诗人出来了。社员杜文斌向听众朗诵赞美全民炼钢的诗：
      “风箱能炼万吨钢，
    一锤打下千斤粮；
    日夜轮班多生产，
    笑把月亮当太阳。”
    胡大娘的儿媳妇李荣花朗诵了歌颂人民公社好的诗后，大娘抑制不住自己的激动，也跑上台去，非常自然地随口向大家念了一首现编的诗：
    谁说歌儿不会唱，
    谁说歌手不能当，
    只要大家把嘴开，
    跃进歌声响四方。
    妇女从前尽受苦，
    万人踩来万人欺，
    共产党来解放咱，
    它是咱们的亲生母。
