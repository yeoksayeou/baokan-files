Xinhua News Agency, December 15th - The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Journalists Association jointly held a banquet this evening to welcome the Hungarian journalists delegation headed by Nemes Dezső, editor-in-chief of "People's Freedom Daily," candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the banquet and met with all members of the Hungarian journalists delegation before the banquet. Comrade Chen Yi welcomed the delegation on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in his speech. Comrade Chen Yi expressed his deep emotion for the speech made by Head of Delegation Nemes Dezső at the banquet. He said: "We welcome you to China. This is an honor for the Chinese people. We hope that the people of China and Hungary and the two parties will extensively exchange experiences in the common struggle." Comrade Chen Yi finally proposed a toast to the fighting friendship between the parties and peoples of China and Hungary.

Head of Delegation Nemes Dezső spoke at the meeting. With language overflowing with internationalist friendship, he warmly praised the friendship between the people of Hungary and China and the fraternal parties of Hungary and China. He said: "We are very happy to see that Chinese comrades are with us in times of difficulty and with us in times of joy."

In his speech, Head of Delegation Nemes Dezső looked back on the Hungarian people's struggle to put down the counter-revolutionary restoration during the October 1956 incident. He said that this struggle was not only a struggle of the Hungarian people, but also a struggle between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. With the support of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people crushed the joint offensive of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and achieved a historically significant victory. The socialist system in Hungary has been further consolidated, and the Hungarian people have become stronger under the leadership of our party. Head of Delegation Nemes Dezső finally warmly congratulated the closer friendship between the people of Hungary and China.

Wu Lengxi, Vice President of the All-China Journalists Association and editor-in-chief of "People's Daily," delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet, warmly welcoming the delegation to visit China during the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in our country. Wu Lengxi said that journalists from China and Hungary have common socialist goals and common Marxist-Leninist ideas, and our friendship and cooperation are unbreakable. Wu Lengxi said that Chinese journalists are very happy about the great victories achieved by the Hungarian people and Hungarian journalists in the struggle to defend the socialist system and in the cause of building socialism. Wu Lengxi said that the victory of the Hungarian people is also our victory. We believe that through this visit of the delegation, the friendly cooperation between Chinese and Hungarian news work will be further strengthened; through the cooperation between news workers of the two countries, the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Hungary will be further consolidated and developed.

Those present at the banquet included: Zhang Ziyi, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, Wang Yutian, Director of the Department of Socialist Countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xu Huang, Deputy Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and heads of various news organizations in the capital.
