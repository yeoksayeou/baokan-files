We Rural Women Have Culture and Knowledge
Gao Yongjun
From Fengtian Production Team, Luhua Work Area, Jiejie People’s Commune, Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province

Our Fengtian Cooperative (now Fengtian Production Team) used to be a remote place. In the old society, poor people couldn't afford to study. Among the ninety-eight poor and lower-middle peasant women, not one was literate. After liberation, our cooperative established a literacy school. But at that time, women always "attended winter school every year, only to start from scratch every year." No one ever graduated from literacy classes. In 1956, when the socialist upsurge swept the countryside, our cooperative launched a vigorous march towards culture. After more than a year of hard work, by May 1st, 1957, we had basically become a literacy-free cooperative. All sixty-seven young and middle-aged women in the cooperative began to liberate themselves from the pain of being uncultured.

After eliminating illiteracy, our cooperative Party branch promptly put forward the slogan of "read a hundred books, write ten thousand characters, and read the newspaper every day." Our cooperative's sixty-seven young and middle-aged women actively plunged into the reading and writing movement. This year in July, the cooperative further proposed to "study political theory and study Chairman Mao's works." At this time, some women said: "It's enough to be able to read oil coupons and cloth coupons and record work points. We don't want to do great things. It's the same whether we study or not." Some women said: "We are roughnecks, how can we learn theory?" In response to these ideas, the branch leaders debated whether theory could be learned and what the use of learning theory was. At the debate, someone said: "Theory is created by the people, and the people can learn it. Didn't Ma Shifan from our cooperative, who just graduated from literacy classes, start studying 'On Practice'? If she can learn, why can't we? It's still because we don't have the determination.” After the debate, superstitious ideas were dispelled, and confidence was strengthened. Many women immediately purchased Chairman Mao's works and various theoretical publications, and also subscribed to various newspapers.

From 1956 to now, we have always insisted on year-round learning. Production is so busy, and women also have housework and children, so there are certain difficulties in terms of learning time. However, with determination and vigor, there is time. We adopted the learning method of "where production goes, learning goes; where people go, books go." The fields, construction sites, and bedsides are all our places of learning. Women who go out and return to their parents' homes all receive learning tasks. We can't give up learning just like we can't give up production or eating. Sun Yuhua, a mother of four children, couldn't get out of bed because of illness, but she always insisted on learning. Ma Shifan, a mother of three children, put a book next to her while doing needlework, reading while working.

The Party branch and the literacy school, at each stage, organized various learning groups tailored to the characteristics of women. Those who had heavy housework and many children and could not attend centralized classes were assigned to bedside groups and package learning groups. This year, twenty-one elderly people with poor reading ability were organized into three listening groups, each group being equipped with stronger tutors. Fifteen young people with higher education were incorporated into philosophy research groups and technical groups. At the same time, we were also helped to arrange housework.

In learning, women implemented the policy of learning for application and linking theory with practice. The Party branch helped women select books on agricultural technology, household sideline production, maternal and child hygiene, and youth self-cultivation, adapting to local conditions and personal needs. When women didn't know how to treat seeds with medicine, they were taught to learn the baking soda seed soaking method, so that women who didn't like to read agricultural technical books in the past became eager to read them. Production team leaders were introduced to how to be production team leaders, and pregnant women and new mothers were selected textbooks on prenatal hygiene and childcare knowledge.

Now, on average, each woman has read one hundred and nine books, written more than twenty thousand characters, and one thousand three hundred and twenty poems. Regarding theoretical books, we have already finished reading "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "Declaration of the Moscow Meeting," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," and other important articles.

Through learning, women have culture and knowledge. Now, everyone reads and everyone creates. More than fifty of the sixty-seven young and middle-aged women can write poetry. Ma Shifan, who used to be illiterate, has now written more than one hundred poems.

Having learned theory, our class consciousness has been raised. For example, after learning Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," we recognized that He Fengming's sabotage of cooperativization was a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, and we exposed his words and deeds. Now, women praise good deeds and criticize bad deeds. When they have shortcomings, they examine themselves. This year, when the cooperative carried out the rectification movement, women wrote a total of four thousand and forty big-character posters.

Women have also changed old customs and habits. No one is superstitious about gods and Buddhas or believes in fate anymore. After reading the book "Don't Ask Gods for Anything," Li Guizhi immediately tore down the "Zhang Xian" statue enshrined in her home. Ma Shifan used to raise pigs that didn't live, and she said it was because her fate was bad. After reading "How to Raise Pigs," she started raising pigs again. She said: "I don't believe in fate anymore." Lu Guiqin used to be bad to her mother-in-law. After reading "Is Mother-in-law a Slave," she took the initiative to make a self-criticism to her mother-in-law. Now the family is very harmonious.

    我们农村妇女有文化有知识了
    黑龙江省泰来县街基人民公社禄化作业区丰田生产队  高勇军
    我们丰田社（现在是丰田生产队）过去是个偏僻的地方，旧社会里穷人念不起书，九十八户贫雇农妇女中没有一个识字的。解放后，我们社就成立了民校，可是那时候妇女总是“年年上冬学，年年从头学”，一年到头也没有一个扫盲毕业的。1956年农村掀起社会主义高潮的时候，我们社轰轰烈烈地向文化大进军，经过一年多的苦战，到1957年“五一”实现了基本无盲社，全社六十七名青壮年妇女，开始从没有文化的痛苦中解放出来。
    在扫除文盲之后，我们社党支部及时提出了“读百本书，写万个字，天天读报”的号召。我们社六十七名青壮年妇女又积极投入了读书写字运动。今年7月社里进一步提出“大学政治理论，学毛主席著作”。这时，有的妇女说：“会看油票、布票、能记工分就行了，咱也不想作大事，学不学都一样。”有的妇女说：“我们是大老粗，那能学理论？”根据这些思想，支部领导辩论能不能学理论，学理论有啥用？辩论会上有人说：“理论是人民创造的，人民就能学，咱社马士范不是刚扫盲毕业就学起实践论来了吗？她能学，咱就不能学？还是咱们没决心。经过辩论，迷信思想打消了，信心坚定了，当场就有不少妇女购买毛主席著作和各种理论刊物，还订阅了各种报纸。
    我们从1956年到现在，一直坚持常年学习，生产这么忙，妇女们还有家务和孩子，在学习时间上是有一定困难的，但是，有决心有劲头，就有时间。我们采用了生产到那里，学习到那里，人到那里，书到那里的学习方法。地头、工地、炕头，都是我们学习的场所，出外和回娘家的妇女都领学习任务。我们扔不开学习，就和扔不开生产，扔不开吃饭一样，四个孩子的妈妈孙玉华，有病不能起炕，可是她始终坚持学习。三个孩子的妈妈马士范，在作针线时还把书放在旁边，边做活边看书。
    党支部和民校在每个阶段，都针对妇女的特点，组织多种多样的学习小组。把家务重，孩子多不能上集中班的人分别编到炕头组、包教包学组，今年还把阅读能力差的二十一名老人，组织了三个听读组，每个组都配上了较强的辅导员，把文化较高的十五名青年，编入了哲学研究组和技术组，同时还帮助我们安排了家务。
    妇女在学习中，贯彻了学以致用、理论联系实际的方针。党支部因人制宜的帮助妇女挑选一些农业技术、家庭副业、妇婴卫生、青年修养等书籍。妇女不会药剂拌种，就教妇女学习小苏打浸种法，使妇女们由过去不爱看农业技术书变成大家抢着看。给生产队长介绍怎样当生产队长，给孕产妇挑选产期卫生和育儿知识课本。
    现在，平均每个妇女读了一百零九本书，写了两万多字，一千三百二十首诗歌，理论书籍，已经读完关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，莫斯科会议的宣言，矛盾论，实践论，论人民民主专政等重要文章。
    经过学习，妇女们有文化有知识了，现在是人人读书，个个创作。六十七名青壮年妇女就有五十多名会作诗，过去一字不识的马士范现在已写出一百多首诗。
    学了理论，我们阶级觉悟提高了。比如学了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，认清了何凤鸣破坏合作化是敌我矛盾，揭发了他的言行。现在妇女看到好事就表扬，坏事就批评，自己有了缺点就检讨，今年社里开展整风运动，妇女们共写了四千零四十张大字报。
    妇女还改变了旧的风俗习惯，没有人迷信神佛、相信命运了。李桂芝看“万事不求神”一书后，马上就把家里供的“张仙”撕掉。马士范过去养猪不活，她说是自己命不好，看了“怎样养猪”她就重新养了猪，她说：“我再不信命了。”吕桂琴过去对婆婆不好，她看了“是婆母是奴隶”之后，主动地向婆母作了检讨，现在家庭非常和睦。
