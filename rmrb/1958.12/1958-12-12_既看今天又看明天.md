    Looking at Today and Tomorrow
    Yu Chuan
    Our Party has always attached importance to cultivating veteran workers. Because veteran workers have more experience in political struggle and rich technical knowledge, they are the backbone of enterprise production. The Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory's initial attention to resolving the learning problems of veteran workers when the factory was establishing schools on a large scale was very correct. Doing so meets the requirements and aspirations of veteran workers, and it also meets the long-term interests of national construction. Veteran workers have two demands. One is to actively build socialism; they work selflessly and have made many contributions. The other demand is to study and improve their cultural and scientific knowledge. When veteran workers have scientific knowledge, it is easier to summarize and improve their rich production experience, which is a great thing for both the workers and the country.
    However, a new problem has arisen in some factories in the current school-running process, which is that veteran workers cannot find places to attend part-work, part-study schools everywhere. This problem has also occurred at the Jiangling Machine Factory. The main reason is the conservatism and shortsightedness of some cadres in their thinking. They are afraid that drawing veteran workers to participate in part-work, part-study schools will affect the completion of production tasks. Therefore, when veteran workers request to study, the cadres do not support them, dare not let them go, and always want to keep them for learning when the tasks are less tight. They do not understand that production and learning are dialectical; they do not understand that today's tasks are tight and production needs veteran workers, but tomorrow's national construction will develop by leaps and bounds, and production tasks will be even tighter. Only by cultivating veteran workers well and enabling them to master scientific and cultural knowledge can they undertake more complex production tasks with higher scientific and technological levels.
    Taking veteran workers away for study may temporarily conflict with production. The Jiangling Machine Factory Party Committee sees this problem very clearly. They have foresight, seeing both today and tomorrow. They see not only the contradictory aspect of learning and production, but more importantly, they also see the unified aspect of production and learning. By clearly understanding the relationship between the two and properly arranging production and learning, the contradictions will be unified and become a force for mutual promotion. The facts show that when the factory's Party Committee resolutely persuaded those cadres with conservative ideas, making them understand the dialectical relationship between learning and production, and understand the importance of cultivating veteran workers for the leap-forward development of production, the cadres and the masses (including the veteran workers themselves) will find ways to create conditions so that veteran workers have the opportunity to study. As a result, the Jiangling Machine Factory has reaped several harvests. After the demands of veteran workers were met, their production enthusiasm became even higher. Although the participation in learning has only been for a short two months, the effects have been quickly apparent. The knowledge they have learned has already shown results in production. Learning has promoted production, and the tasks have also been completed.
    The practice of the Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory Party Committee is worth advocating. When they discover ideological problems among the cadres in the factory's school-running process, they first do not rush to solve some minor contradictions, but instead seize this major contradiction and raise it to the height of ideology for discussion and research. As a result, the contradictions in the factory's school-running process have been resolved, the learning enthusiasm of the masses has been improved, and the thinking of the cadres has also been improved. This is not only a very good leadership method for solving the factory's school-running problems, but also a very good leadership method for solving other problems.

    既看今天又看明天

    我们党是一贯重视培养老工人的。因为老工人的政治斗争经验较多，生产技术知识丰富，是企业生产中的骨干。重庆江陵机器厂在工厂大办学校时，一开始就注意解决老工人的学习问题是非常正确的。这样做，既符合老工人的要求和愿望，也符合国家建设的长远利益的。老工人有两种要求。一是积极建设社会主义，他们忘我地劳动，作出了许多贡献。另一个要求是学习，提高自己的文化和科学知识水平。老工人有了科学知识，就便于把自己丰富的生产经验总结提高，这对工人和对国家来说，都是一件大好事。
    但是，目前有些工厂在办学中，发生了一个新的问题，就是老工人到处上不到半工半读学校。这个问题，在江陵机器厂也曾经发生过。主要的原因是有些干部思想上的保守和短见。他们怕把老工人抽出参加半工半读学校学习后，会影响生产任务的完成。因此，当老工人提出要求学习的时候，干部不支持、不敢放，总想把他们留在任务松一些的时候去学习。他们不懂得生产与学习是辩证的；不懂得今天任务紧，生产上需要老工人，明天国家建设飞跃发展，生产任务会更紧，只有很好培养老工人，使他们掌握科学文化知识，才能够担负科学技术水平更高的、更繁重的生产任务。
    把老工人抽去学习，暂时可能与生产有矛盾。江陵机器厂党委在这个问题上看得非常清楚。他们有远见，既看到了今天，也能看到明天。他们不只是看到学习与生产有矛盾的一面，更重要的是还看到了生产和学习统一的一面。把二者关系认识清楚了，妥善地安排生产和学习，矛盾就会统一起来，成为互相促进的力量。事实正是这样表明的，当这个厂的党委态度坚决地说服了那些具有保守思想的干部，让他们懂得学习和生产的辩证关系，懂得培养老工人对生产飞跃发展的重要意义后，干部和群众（包括老工人自己）就会想办法创造条件，使老工人有学习的机会。江陵机器厂这样做的结果，获得了几方面的丰收。老工人的要求得到满足后，生产热情更加高涨。虽然参加学习还只有短短的两个月，但很快就立竿见影。目前他们学得的知识就已经在生产上显出了成效。学习推动了生产，任务也完成了。
    重庆江陵机器厂党委的做法，是值得提倡的，他们发现工厂办学中干部思想问题，首先不是忙着去解决一些次要矛盾，而是抓住这个主要矛盾，提到思想的高度加以讨论研究。结果，工厂办学的矛盾解决了，群众的学习情绪提高了，干部思想也提高了，这不仅是解决工厂办学的一个很好的领导方法，也是解决其他问题的一个很好的领导方法。
