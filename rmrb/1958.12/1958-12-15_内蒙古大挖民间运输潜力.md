Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 14th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, based on local climate, traffic conditions and other characteristics, is vigorously exploiting civilian transportation potential and launching a large-scale winter transportation campaign. On the grasslands of the Autonomous Region, thousands of camels and ox carts have been organized. Six pastoral banners of the Xilingol League and Ulanqab League recently dispatched a herder transport team consisting of more than four thousand camels and nearly ten thousand ox carts, and are rushing to transport more than six million catties of livestock winter feed.
    In order to enhance the transportation capacity of materials such as grain, coal, and ore, after the major rivers in Inner Mongolia, such as the Yellow River and the West Liao River, freeze over, a battle of ice transportation will be launched. Some communes have even put all available tools into use, such as seeders, double-shared plows, and walking plows. (Attached pictures)

    内蒙古大挖民间运输潜力
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电  内蒙古自治区各地根据当地气候、交通条件等特点，多方面挖掘民间运输潜力，大搞冬季运输运动。在自治区草原上，成千上万的骆驼和牛车已经被组织起来。锡林郭勒盟、乌兰察布盟的六个牧业旗，最近出动了由四千多峰骆驼和近万辆牛车组成的牧民驮运队，正在赶运六百多万斤牲畜过冬的饲料。
    为增强粮食、煤炭、矿石等物资运输力量，内蒙古境内黄河、西辽河等主要河流封冻以后，就要进行一场冰上运输的战斗。有些公社甚至把播种机、双铧犁、步犁等一切可以利用的工具都运用了起来。（附图片）
