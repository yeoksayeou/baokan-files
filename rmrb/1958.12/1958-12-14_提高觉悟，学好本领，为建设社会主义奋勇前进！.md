Raise Awareness, Master Skills, and Forge Ahead Vigorously for Socialist Construction!
Report by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, at the National Conference of Active Women in Socialist Construction

Comrade representatives:

In the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, you have accepted the glorious entrustment of the broad masses of women, bringing your great achievements and rich experiences to gather in the capital for this conference. Everyone is especially happy. At the conference, Comrade Peng Dehuai gave us important instructions on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We warmly support the instructions of the Party Central Committee; we must, according to the spirit of the instructions and in combination with the exchange of experiences and mutual learning, discuss how women can more fully play an active role in socialist construction and make greater contributions. Now I would like to offer some opinions on the following issues for discussion at the conference.

Great Achievements, Glorious Tasks

In the past year, under the glorious illumination of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results to build socialism" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have displayed soaring enthusiasm and achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward on all fronts. This year's total grain output may increase by about 90% compared with last year, and cotton may also increase by 100%. In recent months, the people's commune movement has developed rapidly and smoothly, and now the rural areas across the country have basically realized the people's commune system. The mass movement of vigorously developing industry with steel as the key link is developing vigorously throughout the country. This year, the leap forward plan of completing 10.7 million tons of steel may be achieved; at the same time, steel takes the lead, driving the rapid advancement of the entire industrial production and transportation industries. On the cultural and educational front, the Chinese people have also achieved great achievements.

In this high tide of socialist construction, under the leadership of the Party, the number of women of all ethnic groups in our country participating in social labor has increased unprecedentedly, the scope of labor has expanded unprecedentedly, and they have contributed tremendous strength to the comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Rural women have actively participated in agricultural production and have played a significant role in this year's bumper agricultural harvest. In the mass movement of vigorously developing industry with steel as the key link, the broad masses of women, like men, bravely plunged into the torrent of large-scale steelmaking. Not only did this play a significant role in completing this year's task of doubling steel production, but it also helped them learn the skills of steelmaking and ironmaking. Women have also actively participated in various other heavy industries, light industries, and transportation industries. In commerce and various service industries, and on the fronts of education, health, culture, science, and art, women have made outstanding contributions. In the mass technological revolution movement, many women have liberated their minds, learned technology, displayed originality, and made many inventions and creations. With the rapid development of production and the participation of a large number of women in social labor, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, maternity hospitals, sewing factories, and other collective living welfare facilities have been widely established in rural people's communes and many cities, liberating a large amount of female labor. Female soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, female members of the self-defense forces, and female militia members have also bravely participated in the struggle to defend the construction of the motherland. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have given great encouragement and support to their loved ones participating in the struggle to defend the motherland. In the Great Leap Forward, women have greatly improved their communist ideological awareness and enthusiasm for building socialism, are full of spirit, high in fighting spirit, and are firmly marching forward on the road of socialism.

The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction in 1958 is a victory of the Party's general line of socialist construction, achieved on the basis of a vigorous mass movement under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. At the same time, the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction was also achieved under the international situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The socialist countries led by the Soviet Union are all making Great Leaps Forward, the national independence movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries are booming, and the ranks and forces of people around the world defending peace are growing and strengthening; while the aggressive blocs headed by US imperialism are becoming increasingly unpopular, and US aggressive policies are running into walls everywhere. Such an international situation, as well as the comprehensive and fraternal assistance given to us by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, has created favorable conditions for our Great Leap Forward. At the same time, our Great Leap Forward has further enhanced the power of the East Wind, increased the spirit of the world's people, and weakened the prestige of imperialism. We firmly oppose US imperialism's war threats and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, firmly oppose the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and firmly oppose US imperialism's aggressive policies. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, we must safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and we must safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

Comrades! The achievements of the 1958 Great Leap Forward are great; however, these achievements are still far from the goals required to completely build a socialist society and from the highest ideals of communism. We still have many arduous tasks before us, so we must not be satisfied with today's achievements. We must promote our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, continue to work hard, and advance victoriously.

The great historical task of the Chinese people at the present stage is to build socialism. That is, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, according to the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Party, actively promote the consolidation and development of the people's communes. Through the social organizational form of the people's communes, develop industry and agriculture at high speed, promote national industrialization, commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization, electrification, and make science and culture reach the world's most advanced level; gradually build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agricultural, and modern science and culture, and create conditions for the gradual transition from socialist society to communist society in the future. This is also the glorious task of the women of our country.

1959 is the second year of the three years of hard work. Successfully completing next year's construction tasks is of decisive significance for fundamentally changing the face of our country and for accelerating socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party, the women of our country must, together with the people of the whole country, complete and over fulfill the grand and arduous construction plan of the country in 1959, strive for continued high-speed growth in steel and grain production, and strive for a greater leap forward upsurge in various socialist constructions. In the past few months, rural areas throughout the country have been carrying out the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes under the leadership of the Party. Female commune members should work together with all commune members to strengthen and improve the political and ideological work of the people's communes, establish and improve various systems, and put the production and construction and living welfare undertakings of the people's communes on the track of sound development as soon as possible.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the women of the whole country, together with the people of the whole country, promoted our country to take a big step towards the beautiful prospect of building socialism. In 1959, our women must continue to go all out, work more actively, strive to develop production, participate in various socialist construction tasks; vigorously develop collective living welfare undertakings; strive to study politics, continuously improve communist awareness, give play to the enthusiasm for building socialism; make up their minds, establish perseverance, study technology diligently, learn culture, improve construction skills; and make greater contributions to socialist construction.

Actively Labor, Strive for Production

The tasks of production and construction now before us are enormous. To complete this task, we need our women to labor more actively and strive for production. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year and strive for a greater bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and other crops, our women must continue to work hard to participate in agricultural production and become a main force in agricultural production. We must also actively participate in forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, sideline production, etc. Women have always been good at managing cash crops such as cotton, oil crops, and tea, as well as sideline production such as raising pigs, chickens, and silkworms, and will continue to give play to these strengths and do a good job in these productions in the future. Next year, we must continue to strive for a greater leap forward in industrial production. We must actively support and participate in steel and machinery production, and strive to participate in textile, transportation, and other industrial construction. We should participate more actively in cultural, educational, medical, health, collective living welfare, and various service undertakings; and, according to the needs of the country, gradually achieve women replacing men in suitable work positions, so that the labor force of the entire society can be more rationally arranged.

In order to play a greater role in production and construction, our women must further recognize the great significance of active labor for socialist construction. Chairman Mao once pointed out: "Chinese women are a great source of manpower. This resource must be tapped and struggled for the construction of a great socialist country." (See Volume II, page 675 of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the large-scale and comprehensive development of socialist construction, a large amount of labor is needed. The number of women participating in production has greatly increased, the scope of labor production has expanded unprecedentedly, and the role of women in production has become more obvious. These facts fully prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis. It is precisely because the women, who account for half of China's labor force, work together with men that China's socialist construction has achieved such a great victory.

The universal participation of women in various social labor is also a fundamental condition for the complete liberation of women. Working women in our country have always loved labor. However, in the old society of class oppression, the broad masses of working women and their families worked hard all year round, unable to get enough to eat and wear, and lived a poor and painful life. In such a society, there is no question of women's liberation. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially after the completion of the socialist revolution and the basic realization of the public ownership of the means of production, Chinese women, together with men, have been freed from exploitation and oppression and have been liberated. The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the realization of people's communes have created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for women to participate in social labor. The role of women in socialist construction has increased significantly, and through the exercise of social labor, their horizons have been broadened, and their knowledge and ability have been greatly improved; this has further broken the old social view of favoring men over women, women's labor has been universally respected, and women's status has been raised to an unprecedented level. These facts prove that the greater the achievements of socialist construction, the greater the contribution of women, the more conducive it is to the complete liberation of women.

In our society, labor is to create wealth for the collective and the country, to create a good life for the people of the whole country, the women of the whole country, and future generations; labor is the most glorious and heroic career, and it is the most important thing in our lives. All labor that serves the cause of socialist construction is glorious. Whether it is working in a factory, farming in the fields, being a teacher, being a doctor, cooking in the canteen, or teaching children in the nursery, they are all indispensable tasks for building socialism, and they are all noble and glorious jobs that serve the people, and we should all do them well. Manual labor is the most basic labor. People create the material wealth of society through manual labor, and on this basis, there is cultural life. Without manual labor, human beings cannot live, let alone have any cultural and scientific creations. There are still some people who despise labor, especially manual labor, and distinguish between noble and lowly, high and low, and pick and choose; these are all incorrect. Our women must continue to carry forward the communist spirit of going wherever the Party points; continue to give play to soaring enthusiasm, not be afraid of hardship, not be afraid of difficulties, and, according to the needs of the country, go to labor wherever labor is needed, and contribute all our strength to socialist construction.

Vigorously Develop Collective Living Welfare Undertakings

Our purpose of developing production is to gradually improve the people's lives. The Party calls on us to improve our lives while doing a good job in production. It is difficult to do a good job in production without doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings. Since the implementation of the people's commune system, in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, various places have established a large number of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, homes for the elderly, sewing factories, and other collective living welfare facilities, which have transformed the scattered household chores into social collective undertakings. This is a great revolution in people's lives.

Doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings can make people live well, be full of energy, be in a good mood, and be more enthusiastic. Doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings can also enhance people's collectivist ideology, strengthen organizational discipline, improve production efficiency, and promote the development of production. Doing a good job in collective living welfare undertakings is even more beneficial to women. After the socialization of housework, the contradiction between women's participation in social production and taking care of housework is resolved, so that female labor is greatly liberated and can contribute more to socialist construction. Collective living welfare work is a major event related to the lives of all the people, related to promoting production, consolidating the communes, related to socialist construction, and related to the complete liberation of women; it is a noble cause of serving the people with great political significance. In the old society, service labor was looked down upon. Some people were influenced by this idea and were unwilling to do it, which is not right. To do this well, we must, under the leadership of the Party, rely on the joint efforts of our broad masses. Regardless of men or women, we should actively participate in and support this cause. Women account for the majority of those who are working in these positions now, and this is our glory. Among the comrades present here, there are many model cooks, caregivers, nursery workers, health workers, midwives, sewing workers, administrators, etc. You have played an active role in driving the masses to do a good job in collective living welfare undertakings, and in the future, you need to continue to carry forward the spirit of diligently and practically serving the people and do a better job in this cause.

Among the various collective living welfare undertakings, we must first do a good job in canteens. We must ensure that everyone eats enough, eats well, and eats cleanly and hygienically. The meals must be nutritious and diversified. In cold weather, hot meals must be served. We must respect the living habits of the local people of all ethnic groups; we must also take care of the needs of children, the elderly, pregnant women, lying-in women, breastfeeding mothers, and patients; and make it possible for them to eat suitable meals. The canteen should also be equipped with seasonings such as salt, vinegar, soy sauce, chili, scallions, and garlic. It should also be equipped with a breeding farm to raise pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, and dairy cows, and set up flour mills, tofu workshops, sauce gardens, and vegetable gardens. It can also be equipped with a small shop and a food processing department to meet people's special needs. We must find ways to build dining halls or vacate houses so that everyone can eat in the houses, and we must also do a good job in the storage of winter vegetables and fuel. In short, we want everyone to feel that eating in the canteen is better and more convenient than eating at home, and it saves time, and we want to make everyone feel satisfied as much as possible.

We must do a good job in running nurseries and kindergartens. Children are the successors of the communist cause. Educating and raising children is a great cause. We must love the children in nurseries and kindergartens like we love our own children, brothers, and sisters. We must have a high sense of responsibility for the children, and we must make the children live well, eat well, live well, and play well; we must pay attention to hygiene, prevent diseases, and if they get sick, they must be treated quickly, and if there is an infectious disease, they must be isolated quickly to prevent it from spreading. We must educate the children well, so that the children develop good living habits from an early age, cultivate the children's love for the motherland, love for labor, and love for the collective, and make them honest, brave, lively, and strong. We want parents to feel that their children are better educated and raised than at home, and to feel at ease and satisfied. Regarding the form of childcare organizations, it should be based on the local production development and the needs of the masses, and take into account the possible conditions in the area. Day care or full care can be provided, and there should be no forced uniformity.

We must also do a good job in running homes for the elderly so that the helpless elderly can live happily. We must do a good job in running maternity hospitals so that mothers and children are safe and healthy. We must also do a good job in running sewing factories, shoe-making groups, and demolition and washing groups to prepare bedding in a timely manner so that everyone has something to wear and cover themselves with. We must also do a good job in running bathhouses. When the weather is cold and freezing, we must solve the problem of heating in winter and let everyone spend the winter warmly.

To do a good job in collective living welfare undertakings, we must gradually improve them based on the foundation of local production development; it is not right to unilaterally emphasize life without considering the production base. To do a good job in collective living welfare undertakings, we must adhere to the spirit of diligence and thrift, make careful calculations, save food and other expenses, and not be extravagant and wasteful. To do a good job in collective living welfare undertakings, we must be good at following the mass line, discuss matters with everyone, give play to collective strength, and implement democratic management; and adhere to the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. We must advocate reforming tools, especially gradually promoting the semi-mechanization and mechanization of cooking, laundry, and other utensils, to save labor and improve work efficiency. We must select active elements with good backgrounds, political progress, and enthusiasm for serving the people to serve as administrators, cooks, caregivers, nursery workers, health workers, midwives, sewing workers, etc., and train key personnel through red and expert universities, normal schools for kindergartens, and specially organized training courses. In daily work, we continue to use on-site meetings, appraisals, and inspections to exchange experiences and continuously help staff improve their political and professional level so that collective living welfare work can be continuously improved.

With collective living welfare undertakings being established, women participate more in social labor, receive remuneration according to labor like men, and family life is more democratic and united. We advocate abolishing the unreasonable patriarchal system inherited from history, but family life is still necessary. What we need is a family life that is equal between men and women, respects the old and loves the young, and is democratic and united. After children enter nurseries, kindergartens, and schools, they are educated by society, but parents still have the responsibility to educate them, especially to assist childcare institutions and work together to educate and raise children well. Family members should also take care of and help each other in life, and economic expenses should be planned jointly. Under the principle of not hindering collective production and collective life, it is a personal freedom that can be allowed in the large collective to cook some meals, raise some small livestock and poultry, etc. When rural communes plan new residential areas and build houses, they should be suitable for the reunion of men, women, old, and young in each family. Some people think that family life has been destroyed after collectivization; what we have been and are destroying is the feudal patriarchal system, and what we have been and are building is a new democratic and united family, which is more beautiful and happier than at any time in history. Some people always think that any housework is meaningless, which is not right. Historically, housework has always been indispensable for the development of social production and for the survival and prosperity of every nation, and it has always had social value. Class society despises labor and also despises housework; moreover, housework is scattered in each household, so it becomes trivial, and its social significance is often overlooked. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, many women worked hard to do a good job in housework, which played an active role in supporting socialist construction. Now we have universally established public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other collective living welfare facilities, which does not negate the significance of housework, but transforms the originally scattered housework into a social collective undertaking in terms of form and substance, which can do these things better. Even in the present situation where the degree of socialization of housework is increasing day by day, there is still some housework that is indispensable, and it is necessary to do this housework well.

Raise Awareness, Master Skills

To do a good job in production and collective living welfare undertakings, our women must put politics in command. Everyone knows that putting politics in command is the guarantee for doing all work well. In the past year or so, under the leadership of the Party, through the all-people rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, through the propaganda and education movement of the general line of socialist construction, and through the practical exercise of collective labor and collective life, our women have greatly improved their political and ideological awareness, carried forward the communist style and spirit of cooperation, liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and there are heroic deeds everywhere that can be sung and praised.

Currently, under the leadership of the Party, a socialist and communist education movement is being carried out widely and deeply throughout the country. Our women must actively participate in this movement to further improve their communist ideological awareness and give play to their enthusiasm for building socialism. In the society of class oppression, our working women have always been oppressed, and only socialist and communist society can completely liberate women and bring a good and happy life to the people. The facts of the nine years since liberation have already made us personally experience this. Therefore, we must resolutely listen to the Party, adhere to the socialist and communist road, and be determined to completely break with the various ideas of the bourgeoisie; continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism and the two ideologies. For those who have strong bourgeois ideas, we must carry out education and help them improve their awareness. Education and supervision should be strengthened for the former landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other types of bad elements.

The people's commune is a great creation of the people of our country under the leadership of the Party. Now it is the basic unit of the socialist social structure and the best organizational form for accelerating the socialist construction of our country; in the future, after socialism is built in our country, it will be the best organizational form for transitioning to communism and the basic unit of the communist social structure in the future. Therefore, all of our women must firmly establish the idea of loving the people's commune. The facts of the past three or four months have made everyone see the great superiority of the people's commune. The people's commune is large and public, and the degree of collectivization is higher than in the past, and it also has several components of ownership by the whole people; labor and the means of production have been used more rationally and effectively than before, and it can also be scheduled on a larger scale; comprehensively developing industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and comprehensively operating agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, so that economic and cultural undertakings can develop faster; a large number of collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens have been established, people's lives are more convenient, and a large number of women have been liberated from housework and actively invested in social labor; many places have realized the distribution system of combining supply system and wage system, and it is possible to eat without money. Facts have proved that doing a good job in running the people's commune can greatly accelerate the construction speed of our country, can quickly lead us to a happy life, and also create the most fundamental conditions for women to gradually "reduce and eliminate their inequality with men in social production and social life" (Lenin: The Great Initiative), and is a road leading to the complete liberation of women. Our women must love the people's commune, and with the attitude of masters, actively participate in the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's commune, and participate in solving some important problems in the commune through the method of great airing of views, great contention, and great debate. We must always think about the interests of the commune and take a serious attitude towards all undertakings of the commune. We must oppose those who only care about themselves and not the commune, and oppose those ideas and behaviors that harm others and benefit oneself. We must not only ensure that individual interests are subordinate to the interests of the people's commune, but also ensure that the interests of the commune are subordinate to the interests of the country; this is a complete patriotism and collectivism point of view. It is detrimental to the country if you only start from the interests of the commune and do not see the overall interests of the country. In the final analysis, it is also detrimental to the people's commune itself and to individuals. Therefore, the departmentalism that disregards the overall situation should be criticized and constantly eliminated.

In order to prevent us from losing our way in the struggle, in order to better carry out socialist construction, our women must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, and study the Party's policies. The recent facts of women studying theory and policies in various places prove that both working women in factories and rural areas and intellectuals can understand policies and learn theory well. After studying, the direction is clear, the mind is open, there are standards for carrying out work, and there are methods for solving problems. A high tide of studying theory is now being set off in various places, and our women must actively participate and strive to improve their theoretical and policy level.

Our women must also diligently study science and technology, improve their cultural level, and learn the skills of engaging in production, engaging in work, and engaging in life. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, our women have learned and mastered many production technologies, and their cultural level has also improved significantly. In order to meet the urgent need for the continuous leap forward in production, we must work hard to learn technology better and more. We must learn professional skills in our own positions and strive to be proficient and proficient. On the basis of being proficient in one major, we will further learn a variety of technologies and strive to become all-rounders who are both workers and farmers, both literate and martial, and versatile. A good way to learn technology is to learn while doing, learn in labor practice, ask if you don't understand, drill if you don't know, and overcome difficulties in every possible way. This will definitely enable you to learn technology well. Those who already have technology should teach others without any reservation, and encourage the broad masses of women to learn together and improve their skills.

At present, a technological revolution movement centered on semi-mechanization and mechanization is being carried out in various places. In this movement, our women must continue to break superstitions, liberate their minds, overcome conservative and inferior psychology, and carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do; we must cooperate with each other, work together, give play to the strength and wisdom of the collective; we must study diligently and practice hard, learn humbly, and overcome various difficulties bravely and tenaciously; in this way, we will be able to learn to use new tools, improve old tools, carry out technological innovation, boldly invent and create, and do well and skillfully.

Culture is a tool for building socialism and communism, and we must learn technology well and improve our skills. We must learn culture. Since the Great Leap Forward, many women have gotten rid of illiteracy; but at present, there are still some illiterate people in our country, the majority of whom are women. All illiterate young and middle-aged women must participate in literacy learning. Those who have gotten rid of illiteracy must make every effort to consolidate their learning results, continuously improve their cultural level, and learn scientific knowledge; especially women activists, must take the lead in doing this. Intellectual women must combine with the workers and peasants, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, participate in manual labor, thoroughly transform their ideology, and combine cultural and scientific knowledge with labor practice. Working women in factories and rural areas must become knowledgeable, and intellectual women must become working people in factories and rural areas. We must all train ourselves into new people who are both red and expert, and work more actively for the socialist cause.

Pay Attention to Physical Health and Maintain Vigorous Enthusiasm

Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of working women have been full of enthusiasm, fighting bravely and working selflessly, which is very good, and we must continue to carry forward this spirit and work hard in the future. However, when the enthusiasm of laborers is greater and the labor is more intense, we must pay more attention to physical health and safety. People are the most valuable wealth, and people must have healthy bodies to engage in revolution and construction. Chairman Mao often taught us to care for people, to cherish people, and to effectively protect people's health and safety. We must take the work of caring for people as an extremely important work. We must improve working conditions as much as possible according to local conditions, properly solve the problems of eating and clothing, continue to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests, develop medical and health undertakings; and combine labor and rest rhythmically, with work and leisure. We know that people need to work and rest; they need to get up and sleep; they need to fight hard and recuperate; they need to work and have cultural entertainment. Rest well, fatigue disappears, physical strength recovers, enthusiasm is greater, and labor efficiency is higher. This is a very ordinary principle and an objective law.

Our women also have menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeed children. Whether women have good rest and recuperation during pregnancy and childbirth has a significant relationship to their physical health. Getting sick not only causes personal pain, but also hinders the development and growth of children, affects the happiness of family life, and is related to the lasting labor of half of the country's labor force. We must pay close attention and continue to pay attention to ensuring that women do not do heavy work, do not go into cold water, and do not stay up late during menstruation and pregnancy. In the past, some areas implemented "three adjustments and three no adjustments": adjusting dryness and not wetness during menstruation, adjusting lightness and not heaviness during pregnancy, and adjusting nearness and not farness for breastfeeding mothers; this is a good experience and should continue to be promoted. We must also ensure that women have a certain period of vacation before and after childbirth.

To protect the health and safety of women, we must rely on the joint care of everyone in the society, especially the attention of our women. In production, our women must consciously labor, and at the same time, pay attention to physical health and safe production. Female students must also pay close attention to this when working part-time and engaging in sports. Things like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth are all natural physiological phenomena, not shameful things. It is reasonable and legal to ask for appropriate care at these times. The representatives present here are the leaders of the masses. You must not only take the lead in doing a good job in production, but also take the lead in arranging your lives well; and you must discuss with the masses, take measures, and establish systems to ensure good sleep and rest. Women can best understand the needs of women, and you must care for the women around you in every possible way. The more enthusiastic they are, the more attention you must pay to their physical health and safety, and the more you pay attention to their health and safety, the more enthusiastic and persistent they will be, and the more you can ensure the leap forward in production and construction. Therefore, protecting the health and safety of women is not a hindrance, but a promotion; not discouraging, but encouraging; this is a glorious task entrusted to you by the Party and the people, and I believe you will undertake it without hesitation!

Unite the Broad Masses of Women and Advance Courageously Under the Leadership of the Party

Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the active participation of women of all ethnic groups throughout the country in the social labor of industry, agriculture, and various constructions under the leadership of the Party, many advanced women's collectives have emerged from this, and millions of women activists have been trained; they have united and led the broad masses of women of all ethnic groups throughout the country with their advanced thinking and exemplary actions to actively participate in socialist construction. The comrades present here today are the most outstanding representatives among them. I would like to express my respect to you on behalf of the All-China Women's Federation.

Comrades, our socialist construction is a great and arduous undertaking, which requires the joint efforts and collective creation of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party. In order for you to unite and lead a wider range of people in the future and make greater contributions, I hope that you will always listen to the Party, continuously improve your communist awareness, wholeheartedly be loyal to the people, be loyal to the communist cause, and continue to play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridging role among the masses. In any work, we must continue to follow the mass line, carry forward the democratic style, adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses, adopt the method of planting experimental fields, adopt the method of persuasion, unite and educate the masses, humbly learn from the masses, rely on the strength of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and jointly make greater achievements. In work, we must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience; be realistic and refrain from exaggeration. This meeting is a good opportunity for us to learn from each other. We must use this meeting to exchange work experiences and improve our ability to participate in production and manage life so that we can better serve socialist construction.

In the future, after our country is completely built into a socialist society, we will gradually transition to a beautiful communist society through the form of the people's commune. The Party Central Committee has long pointed out that to transition to communism, the following conditions must be met: "Social products are extremely abundant, the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of all the people have been greatly improved, universal education has been popularized and improved, the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, which the old society left behind and must still be preserved during the socialist period, have gradually disappeared, and the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights that reflect these differences have also gradually disappeared, the function of the state is only to deal with external enemy aggression, and it no longer works internally, at which time, our society will enter the communist era of each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." (See "The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing People's Communes in Rural Areas")

Comrades! The task of socialist construction is before us, and the beautiful communist ideal inspires us. We are using our own hands to carry out a great and glorious cause that our predecessors have never done before. Our women throughout the country must, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, continue to raise awareness, master skills, and forge ahead courageously for socialist construction!

    提高觉悟，学好本领，为建设社会主义奋勇前进！
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上的报告
    亲爱的代表同志们：
    在我国社会主义建设全面大跃进的形势下，你们接受了广大妇女群众的光荣委托，带着你们的巨大成绩和丰富经验，会师首都，举行这次大会，大家都格外高兴。在大会上彭德怀同志代表中共中央给我们作了重要的指示，我们热烈拥护党中央的指示；我们要根据指示的精神，并结合交流经验，互相学习，来讨论妇女在社会主义建设中怎样更充分地发挥积极作用，作出更大的贡献。现在我就下列几个问题提出意见，供大会讨论。
    伟大的成就  光荣的任务
    一年来，在党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民发挥了冲天干劲，在各个战线上取得了全面大跃进。今年粮食总产量可能比去年增产90％左右，棉花也可能增产一倍。最近几个月来，人民公社化运动迅速而顺利地发展，现在全国农村已经基本上实现了人民公社化。以钢为纲的大办工业的群众运动，正在全国各地轰轰烈烈地发展着，今年可能完成一千零七十万吨钢的跃进计划；同时钢铁一马当先，带动了整个工业生产和交通运输业迅速前进。在文教战线上，我国人民也同样取得了很大的成就。
    在这个社会主义建设高潮中，我国各族妇女在党的领导下，参加社会劳动的人数空前增多，劳动范围空前扩大，对全面大跃进贡献了巨大的力量。农村妇女都积极地参加了农业生产，对于今年农业大丰收起了重大作用。在以钢为纲的大办工业的群众运动中，广大妇女群众同男子一样，英勇地投入大炼钢铁的洪流，不仅对于完成今年钢产量翻一番的任务起了很大作用，而且学习了炼钢炼铁的本领。妇女们也积极参加了其他各种重工业、轻工业和交通运输业。在商业和各种服务事业方面，在教育、卫生、文化、科学、艺术战线上，妇女都有出色的贡献。在群众性的技术革命运动中，许多妇女解放了思想，学会了技术，发挥了独创精神，有不少发明创造。随着生产的飞跃发展，随着大量妇女的参加社会劳动，在农村人民公社和许多城市，普遍举办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院、缝纫厂等集体生活福利设施，解放出大量的妇女劳力。人民解放军的女战士、自卫队的女队员、和女民兵们，还英勇地参加了保卫祖国建设的斗争。军烈属们对于自己的亲人参加保卫祖国的斗争给了很大的鼓励和支持。妇女们在大跃进中，共产主义思想觉悟和建设社会主义的积极性有了更大的提高，精神焕发，斗志昂扬，坚定地在社会主义道路上大踏步地前进。
    1958年我国社会主义建设全面大跃进，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是在中国共产党的领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动的基础上取得的。同时，我国社会主义建设全面大跃进，也是在东风压倒西风的国际形势下取得的。以苏联为首的各社会主义国家都在大跃进，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族独立运动蓬勃发展，世界各国人民保卫和平的队伍和力量日益扩大和加强；而以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团却越来越不得人心，美国侵略政策到处碰壁。这样的国际形势，以及苏联和社会主义各国所给予我们的全面的兄弟般的援助，为我们的大跃进创造了有利条件。同时，我们的大跃进又进一步增强了东风的威力，长世界人民的志气，灭帝国主义的威风。我们坚决反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行战争威胁和军事挑衅，坚决反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策。我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，一定要维护祖国主权和领土的完整，一定要保障远东和世界和平。
    同志们！1958年大跃进的成就是伟大的；但是这些成就，同完全建成社会主义社会所要求达到的目标相比，同共产主义的最高理想相比，还差得很远。在我们面前还有许多艰巨工作，因此我们绝不能满足于今天的成绩，我们一定要发扬优点，克服缺点，继续努力，乘胜前进。
    我国人民现阶段的伟大的历史任务是建设社会主义。这就是在中国共产党的领导下，根据党所提出的社会主义建设的总路线，积极促进人民公社的巩固和发展，经过人民公社这种社会组织形式，高速度地发展工业和农业，促进全国工业化，公社工业化，农业机械化、电气化，科学、文化达到世界最先进的水平；逐步把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，并为将来由社会主义社会逐步过渡到共产主义社会创造条件。这也正是我国妇女的光荣任务。
    1959年是苦战三年的第二年，胜利地完成明年的建设任务，对于基本改变我国面貌，对于加速社会主义建设具有决定的意义。我国妇女一定要在党的领导下，和全国人民一起，完成和超额完成1959年国家宏伟而艰巨的建设计划，争取钢铁和粮食产量继续高速度地增长，争取社会主义各项建设出现更大的跃进高潮。在最近几个月中，全国各地农村都要在党的领导下，进行整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，公社女社员要和全体社员一起，共同努力，加强和改进人民公社的政治思想工作，确立和健全各种制度，使人民公社的生产建设和生活福利事业尽快地走上健全发展的轨道。
    在1958年的大跃进中，全国妇女和全国人民一起，促使我国朝着建成社会主义的美好前景迈进了一大步。1959年我们妇女要继续鼓足干劲，更加积极劳动，努力发展生产，参加社会主义各项建设工作；大力办好集体生活福利事业；努力学习政治，不断地提高共产主义觉悟，发挥建设社会主义的积极性；下决心，立恒心，钻研技术，学习文化，提高建设本领；为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    积极劳动  努力生产
    现在摆在我们面前的生产建设任务是巨大的。要完成这个任务，需要我们妇女更加积极劳动，努力生产。为了争取明年农业生产更大的跃进，争取粮食、棉花等各种农作物更大的丰收，我们妇女要继续努力参加农业生产，成为农业生产上的一支主力军。我们还要积极参加林业、牧业、渔业、副业等生产，妇女经管棉花、油料、茶叶等经济作物，养猪、养鸡、养蚕等副业生产，从来就是擅长的，今后还要继续发挥这些特长，搞好这些生产。明年要继续争取工业生产更大的跃进，我们要积极支援和参加钢铁、机械生产，努力参加纺织、交通和其他各项工业建设。在文化、教育、医药卫生、集体生活福利和各项服务性事业方面，更应该积极参加；并且要根据国家需要，在适合妇女担任的工作岗位上，逐步作到以女替男，使整个社会的劳动力能够得到更合理的安排。
    为了在生产建设中发挥更大的作用，我们妇女还要进一步认识积极劳动对于社会主义建设的重大意义。毛主席曾经指出：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”（见“中国农村的社会主义高潮”中册六七五页）大跃进以来，由于社会主义建设大规模地全面发展，需要大量的劳动力。妇女参加生产的人数大大增加，劳动生产的范围空前扩大，妇女在生产上的作用更加明显了。这些事实，充分地证明了毛主席的论断的正确性。正是因为有占我国劳动大军半数的妇女和男子一起，共同努力，我国社会主义建设才取得了这样伟大的胜利。
    妇女普遍参加各种社会劳动，也是妇女彻底解放的根本条件。我国劳动妇女，从来是热爱劳动的。但是在阶级压迫的旧社会里，广大劳动妇女和自己的家人，终年劳动，不得温饱，过着贫困痛苦的生活。在这样的社会里，根本谈不上妇女解放。自从中华人民共和国成立，特别是完成了社会主义革命，基本上实现了生产资料公有制以后，我国妇女才和男子一起，摆脱了剥削压迫，获得了解放。社会主义建设的全面大跃进和人民公社化的实现，为妇女参加社会劳动创造了空前有利的条件，妇女们在社会主义建设中的作用显著增长，而且通过社会劳动的锻炼，眼界更加开阔了，知识、能力大大提高了；这就进一步打破了社会上重男轻女的旧观点，妇女的劳动普遍受到了尊重，妇女的地位空前提高了。这些事实证明，社会主义建设的成就越大，妇女的贡献越大，就越有利于妇女的彻底解放。
    在我们的社会里，劳动是为集体、为国家创造财富，是为全国人民、全国妇女和子孙后代创造美好的生活；劳动是最光荣、最豪迈的事业，是我们生活里第一件重要的事情。一切为社会主义建设事业服务的劳动，都是光荣的。不管是做工也好，种田也好，当教员、当医生也好，在食堂里作饭、在托儿所里教养孩子也好，都是建设社会主义不可缺少的工作，都是为人民服务的崇高的光荣的工作，我们都应该好好去作。而体力劳动又是最基本的劳动，人们通过体力劳动创造了社会的物质财富，在这个基础上才有文化生活。如果没有体力劳动，人类既不能生活，更谈不到有什么文化科学的创造。现在还有些人轻视劳动，特别是轻视体力劳动，把各种劳动分别贵贱、高低，挑肥拣瘦；这些都是不正确的。我们妇女一定要继续发扬党指向那里、就奔向那里的共产主义精神；继续发挥冲天干劲，不怕辛苦，不怕困难，根据国家的需要，那里需要劳动，就到那里去劳动，为社会主义建设贡献出我们的全部力量。
    大力办好集体生活福利事业
    我们发展生产的目的，是为了逐步改善人民的生活。党号召我们，在搞好生产的同时，还必需搞好生活。不搞好集体生活福利事业，要搞好生产是有困难的。人民公社化以来，适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，各地已经举办了大量的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院、敬老院、缝纫厂等集体生活福利设施，使一家一户的分散的家务劳动，变成了社会的集体事业，这是人民生活上的一个大革命。
    办好集体生活福利事业，能使人们生活过得好，精神饱满，心情舒畅，干劲更足。办好集体生活福利事业，又能增进人们的集体主义思想，加强组织性纪律性，提高生产效率，促进生产的发展。办好集体生活福利事业，对妇女的好处更多更大。家务劳动社会化以后，解决了妇女参加社会生产和料理家务的矛盾，使妇女劳动力大解放，能够使妇女对社会主义建设贡献更大的力量。集体生活福利工作，是关系全体人民生活，关系促进生产，巩固公社，关系社会主义建设，关系妇女彻底解放的大事；是具有重大政治意义的、为人民服务的崇高事业。旧社会看不起服务性劳动，有些人受了这种思想影响，不愿意去做，这是不对的。要把这件事办好，一定要在党的领导下，靠我们广大群众共同努力，不论男的、女的，都应该积极参加并支持这项事业。现在在这些工作岗位上做工作的，妇女占多数，这是我们的光荣。在座的同志中，有不少模范的炊事员、教养员、保育员、卫生员、助产员、缝纫员、管理员等等，你们在带动群众办好集体生活福利事业中，已经起了积极作用，今后需要继续发扬勤勤恳恳、切切实实的为人民服务的精神，把这项事业办得更好。
    在各项集体生活福利事业中，首先要办好食堂。要让大家吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生。饭菜要有养分，还要多样化，冷天吃上热饭热菜，要尊重当地各族人民的生活习惯；还要照顾小孩、老人、孕妇、产妇、哺乳母亲、病人的需要；尽可能使他们都能吃到合适的饭菜。食堂还要备有盐、醋、酱油、辣椒、葱、蒜等调料。还要附设饲养场，养猪、养羊、养鸡鸭、养鱼、养奶牛，办粉坊、豆腐坊、酱园、种菜园。还可以附设小卖部、食品加工部，满足人们的特殊需要。一定要想办法，修盖饭厅或者腾出房子，让大家在房子里吃饭，还要作好冬季蔬菜和燃料的储备工作。总之，我们要使大家感到在食堂吃饭，比在家里吃得好，吃得方便，还节省时间，尽可能使大家称心如意。
    我们要把托儿所、幼儿园办好。儿童是共产主义事业的接班人，教养儿童是伟大的事业，我们要像疼爱自己的儿女弟妹一样来疼爱托儿所、幼儿园的孩子。对孩子要有高度的责任心，要让孩子们生活得好，吃得好，住得好，玩得好；要讲求卫生，预防疾病，有了病要迅速治疗，发生了传染病，要赶快隔离，以免蔓延。要把孩子教育得好，使孩子从小就养成良好的生活习惯，培养孩子热爱祖国、热爱劳动、热爱集体，使他们诚实、勇敢、活泼、健壮。要使家长感到孩子比在家里教养得更好，放心满意。关于托儿组织的形式，要从当地生产发展和群众的需要出发，并照顾当地可能的条件，可以办日托，也可以办全托，不要强求一致。
    还要办好敬老院，让无依无靠的老人过得幸福。要办好妇产院，让母子安全健康。也要办好缝纫厂、制鞋组、拆洗组，及时准备被服，使大家有穿有盖。还要办好澡堂。当这天寒地冻的时候，要解决冬季烤火取暖问题，让大家暖暖和和地过冬。
    搞好集体生活福利事业，必须根据当地生产发展的基础，逐步提高；离开生产基础，片面地强调生活，是不对的。搞好集体生活福利事业，必须本着勤俭节约的精神，精打细算，节约粮食和其他各项开支，不能铺张浪费。搞好集体生活福利事业，要善于走群众路线，有事大家商量，发挥集体力量，实行民主管理；并坚持群众自愿的原则。要提倡改革工具，特别要逐步促进炊事、洗衣等用具半机械化、机械化，以节省劳动力，提高工作效率。要选拔成分好、政治进步、热心为人民办事的积极分子担任管理员、炊事员、教养员、保育员、卫生员、助产员、缝纫员等，并通过红专大学、幼稚师范和专门举办训练班等培养和训练骨干。在经常工作中，继续采用现场会，评比检查等方式，交流经验，不断地帮助工作人员提高政治业务水平，使集体生活福利工作不断地改进。
    办了集体生活福利事业，妇女更多地参加了社会劳动，和男子一样地按劳动领取报酬，家庭生活更加民主团结。我们主张废除历史上遗留下来的不合理的家长制，但是家庭生活还是必要的。我们需要的，是男女平等、尊老爱幼、民主团结的家庭生活。孩子进了托儿所、幼儿园、学校之后，由社会来教育，父母仍旧有教育的责任，特别要协助儿童教养机关，共同努力，把孩子教养好。一家人还要在生活上互相照顾和帮助，经济开支还要共同计划。在不妨碍集体生产和集体生活的原则下，在家庭里作点饭菜，养点小家畜、家禽等等，这是大集体中可以有的个人自由。农村公社规划新居民点和修建房屋的时候，要适宜于每个家庭男女老幼的团聚。有人认为生活集体化以后，家庭被破坏了；我们已经并正在破坏的是封建的家长制度，我们已经并正在建立的是民主团结的新家庭，这种家庭比历史上任何时期都更加美好和幸福。有些人总认为任何家务劳动都没有意义，这是不对的。历史上家务劳动对于社会生产的发展，对于每个民族的生存和繁荣，从来就是不可缺少的，从来就是有社会价值的。阶级社会轻视劳动，也轻视家务劳动；而且家务劳动分散在一家一户进行，就变成琐碎的，它的社会意义往往被人们忽视。中华人民共和国成立以后，许多妇女努力搞好家务劳动，这对支援社会主义建设起了积极作用。现在我们普遍建立公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利设施，并不是否定家务劳动的意义，是把原来分散的家务劳动，从形式上、实质上都变成了社会的集体事业，这就能够把这些事情搞得更好。就是在现在家务劳动社会化的程度日益增长的情况下，还有一些家务是不可缺少的，做好这些家务劳动，也是必要的。
    提高觉悟  学好本领
    我们妇女要搞好生产，办好集体生活福利事业，必须政治挂帅。大家都知道，政治挂帅是做好一切工作的保证。最近一年多来，我们妇女在党的领导下，经过全民整风和反右派斗争，经过了社会主义建设总路线的宣传教育运动，经过集体劳动和集体生活的实际锻炼，政治思想觉悟大大提高了，发扬了共产主义风格和协作精神，解放了思想，破除了迷信，到处都是可歌可颂的英勇事迹。
    现在全国各地，在党的领导下，正在广泛深入地开展社会主义、共产主义教育运动，我们妇女要积极参加这个运动，更进一步提高共产主义的思想觉悟，发挥建设社会主义的积极性。在阶级压迫的社会里，我们劳动妇女从来就是受压迫的，只有社会主义、共产主义社会才能彻底解放妇女，才能带给人民美好幸福的生活。解放九年来的事实，已经使我们亲身体会到这一点。所以，我们要坚决听党的话，坚持走社会主义、共产主义道路，决心同资产阶级形形色色的思想彻底决裂；继续开展资本主义和社会主义两条道路、两种思想的斗争，对那些有浓厚资产阶级思想的人，要进行教育，帮助他们提高觉悟。对于过去的地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子和其他各类坏分子，更应该加强教育和监督。
    人民公社是我国人民在党的领导下的伟大创举，现在是社会主义社会结构的基层单位，是加速我国社会主义建设的最好的组织形式；将来在我国建成社会主义以后，又是向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式，也是将来共产主义社会结构的基层单位。因此我们全体妇女都要巩固地树立热爱人民公社的思想。最近三、四个月的事实，已经使我们大家看到了人民公社的伟大的优越性。人民公社又大又公，集体化的程度比过去更高了，还带着若干全民所有制的成分；劳动力和生产资料比以前得到了更合理更有效的使用，还可以在更大范围内调度；全面发展工农商学兵，综合经营农林牧副渔，这样，经济和文化事业就可以更快地发展了；大量创办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业，人民生活更加方便了，大批妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，积极投入社会劳动；很多地方实现了供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度，做到了吃饭不要钱。事实证明，办好人民公社可以大大加快我国建设速度，可以迅速把我们引向幸福的生活，又为妇女逐步“减少和消除她们在社会生产和社会生活上同男子的不平等”（列宁：伟大的创举）创造了最根本的条件，是引向妇女彻底解放的道路。我们妇女要热爱人民公社，以主人翁的态度，积极参加整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，通过大鸣大放大辩论的方法，参与解决公社中的一些重要问题。要处处为公社的利益着想，认真对待公社的一切事业。要反对那些只顾自己、不顾公社的个人主义，反对那些损人利己的思想和行为。我们不但要做到个人利益服从人民公社的利益，还要作到公社的利益服从国家的利益；这才是完整的爱国主义、集体主义观点。只从公社利益出发，不看到国家的整体利益，对国家固然不利，归根到底，对人民公社本身和对个人也是不利的。所以对不顾整体、不顾大局的本位主义思想，应该加以批判，不断清除。
    为了使我们在斗争中不会迷失方向，为了更好地进行社会主义建设，我们妇女要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作和党的政策。最近各地妇女学习理论、政策的事实证明，不论工农劳动妇女或者是知识妇女，都能领会政策，学好理论。学了以后，方向明确了，思想开阔了，进行工作有标准了，解决问题有方法了。现在各地正在掀起学习理论的高潮，我们妇女要积极参加，努力把自己理论、政策水平提高一步。
    我们妇女还要刻苦钻研科学技术，提高文化水平，学好搞生产、搞工作、搞生活的本领。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，我们妇女学习并掌握了许多生产技术，文化水平也有显著提高。为了适应生产不断跃进的迫切需要，我们还要下苦功夫更好更多地学习技术。要在自己的岗位上，学会专业的技能，努力作到熟练和精通。在精通一门专业的基础上，进一步学会多种技术，争取作亦工亦农、能文能武、多才多艺的多面手。学习技术的好方法就是边作边学，在劳动实践中学习，不懂就问，不会就钻，千方百计，克服困难，这样一定能学好技术。已经有技术的人，要毫不保守地教给别人，带动广大妇女共同学习，提高本领。
    目前各地正在开展以半机械化、机械化为中心的技术革命运动，在这个运动中，我们妇女要继续破除迷信，解放思想，克服保守、自卑心理，发扬敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格；要互相协作，共同努力，发挥集体的力量和智慧；要勤学苦练，虚心学习，勇敢顽强地克服各种困难；这样，我们就一定能学会使用新工具，改良旧工具，进行技术革新，大胆发明创造，干得好，干得巧。
    文化是建设社会主义、共产主义的工具，我们要学好技术，提高本领，一定要学习文化。大跃进以来，已经有许多妇女摆脱了文盲状态；但目前我国还有一部分文盲，其中妇女占多数。凡是不识字的青壮年妇女，一定要参加扫盲学习。已经摆脱文盲状态的，要千方百计地巩固学习成果，不断提高文化水平，学习科学知识；尤其是妇女积极分子，更要带头作到这一点。知识妇女要和工农群众相结合，虚心向工农群众学习，参加体力劳动，彻底改造思想，使文化科学知识与劳动实践相结合。工农妇女要知识化，知识妇女要工农化，我们大家都要把自己锻炼成又红又专的新人，更好地为社会主义事业积极工作。
    注意身体健康  保持旺盛干劲
    大跃进以来，广大劳动妇女干劲冲天，英勇苦战，忘我劳动，这是很好的，今后必须继续发扬这种精神，艰苦奋斗。但是在劳动者干劲越大，劳动越是紧张的时候，越要注意身体的健康和安全。人是最宝贵的财富，人们要干革命、搞建设，必须有健康的身体。毛主席经常地教导我们，要关心人，爱护人，要切实保障人的健康和安全。我们要把关心人的工作，作为极为重要的工作来做。我们要根据当地的情况，尽可能改善劳动条件，妥善地解决吃饭穿衣问题，继续开展除四害运动，发展医药卫生事业；还要把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来，有劳有逸。我们知道：人要劳动，也要休息；要起床，也要睡觉；要苦战，也要休整；要干活，也要文化娱乐。休息好了，疲劳消失，体力恢复，干劲更大，劳动效率更高，这是很平常的道理，是客观规律。
    我们妇女还要来月经、怀孕、生孩子、奶孩子。妇女在孕期、产期，是不是休息得好，调养得好，对身体健康有重大的关系。生了病，不但个人痛苦，还会妨碍孩子的发育成长，影响家庭生活的幸福，而且关系到全国一半劳动大军持久劳动的问题。我们一定要密切关心，继续注意使妇女在经期、孕期不作重活，不下冷水，不熬夜。过去有些地区实行“三调三不调”，月经期间调干不调湿，孕期调轻不调重，哺乳的母亲调近不调远；这是一条好经验，要继续推广。还要保证妇女产前产后有一定时间的休假。
    保障妇女的健康和安全，要靠社会上大家共同关怀，特别要靠我们妇女的注意。在生产中我们妇女要自觉劳动，同时，还要注意身体健康，安全生产。女学生在勤工俭学和进行体育锻炼时，也要切实注意这一点。妇女来月经、怀孕、生孩子等事情，都是自然的生理现象，不是丢人的事。在这些时候，要求适当照顾，也是合理合法的事。在座的各位代表是群众中的带头人，你们既要带头搞好生产，也要带头安排好生活；并要同群众商量，采取措施，确定制度，保证睡好，休息好。妇女最能体贴妇女的要求，你们对周围的妇女，一定要无微不至的关心。越是她们的干劲大，就越要注意她们的身体健康和安全，越是注意她们的健康和安全，她们就会干劲更足、更持久，就能保证生产建设事业跃进再跃进。所以保护妇女健康和安全，不是促退，而是促进；不是泄气，而是鼓气；这是党和人民交给你们的一项光荣任务，我相信你们一定会毫不犹豫地担当起来！
    在党的领导下团结广大妇女奋勇前进
    大跃进以来，由于全国各族妇女群众，在党的领导下，积极参加了工业、农业和各种建设的社会劳动，从这中间涌现出来许多妇女先进集体，锻炼出了千百万妇女积极分子；她们以自己的先进思想和模范行动，团结和带动了全国各族广大妇女，积极参加社会主义建设。今天在座的各位同志，就是其中最优秀的代表。我谨代表全国妇联向你们表示敬意。
    同志们，我们社会主义建设是伟大的艰巨的事业，需要全国人民在党的领导下，共同努力，集体创造。为了你们今后能够团结和带动更广大的群众，作出更大的贡献，希望你们永远听党的话，不断地提高共产主义觉悟，全心全意地忠实于人民，忠实于共产主义事业，在群众中继续起带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。在任何工作中都必须继续走群众路线，发扬民主作风，采取领导和群众结合的办法，采取种试验田的办法，采取说服办法，团结和教育群众，虚心向群众学习，依靠群众的力量，集中群众的智慧，共同做出更大的成绩。在工作中一定要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁；实事求是，力戒浮夸。这次会议就是我们互相学习的好机会，我们要通过这次会议，交流工作经验，提高我们参加生产和管理生活的能力，以便更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    将来，我国完全建成社会主义社会以后，还要通过人民公社这种形式，逐步向美好的共产主义社会过渡。党中央早已指出，过渡到共产主义，必须具备下列条件：“社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在这种时候，我国社会就将进入各尽所能，各取所需的共产主义时代。”（见“中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”）
    同志们！社会主义建设的任务摆在我们面前，美好的共产主义理想鼓舞着我们，我们正在用自己的双手，进行着前人从来没有作过的伟大光荣的事业，我们全国妇女一定要在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，继续提高觉悟，学好本领，为建设社会主义奋勇前进！
