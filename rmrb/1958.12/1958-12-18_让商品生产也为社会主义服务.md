Theoretical Journal Excerpts

Commodity Production Still Has a Significant Role

The Changjiang (Yangtze River) Half-Monthly published on the 10th carried an article by Wang Guangyuan entitled "On the Current Role of Commodity Production and the Law of Value." The article, after pointing out the erroneous view held by some that commodity production no longer has a need to exist, stated: Since the people's communes are still socialist in nature and the property of the communes is still collectively owned, not owned by the whole people, its products cannot be unconditionally allocated. Since unconditional allocation is not possible, commodity production and commodity circulation cannot be eliminated; the commercial sector, which is the working department of commodity circulation, is not dispensable; and the role of the law of value as a calculation tool in socialist production cannot disappear. Can we immediately declare that the property of the communes is owned by the whole people, implement unconditional national allocation, and abolish commodity production and commodity circulation? No, we cannot. To do so immediately would be a reckless "left"-leaning adventurist mistake. It should be noted that the members of the people's communes were small producers not long ago, and Marxists believe that the working class cannot expropriate small producers. Even after cooperativization and communization, the state often faces contradictions in determining how much grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products to requisition and purchase. If we immediately implement unconditional allocation, abolish trade, and abolish exchange, this is unacceptable to the peasants at present. During the Great Leap Forward in production and in the people's commune movement, the political consciousness of the peasants has greatly increased. However, it would be incorrect to assume that the political consciousness of the peasants has risen to the same level as that of the working class, that the transformation of collective ownership into ownership by the whole people can be immediately carried out, and that allocation can be immediately accepted. Therefore, commodity production and commodity circulation are still the main methods of uniting 500 million peasants economically and are still indispensable for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Furthermore, although agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest and industrial production has made a Great Leap Forward, our social products are still not abundant overall, and the "poor and blank" state has not been fundamentally eliminated. We do not yet have the material basis to abolish commodities and implement national allocation and unified distribution. Without very abundant social products, how can we achieve unified distribution based on "to each according to his needs"? Therefore, abolishing commodity production and implementing unified national allocation is unacceptable to the peasants at present; on the other hand, due to the lack of social products, the state cannot abolish the wage system of "to each according to his work" and replace it with unified distribution based on "to each according to his needs." Therefore, commodity production and commodity circulation are not a matter of cancellation at present, but a matter of expansion with the development of production. Of course, the expansion here refers to quantitative expansion, not expansion in scope. In terms of scope, commodity production and commodity circulation are gradually being restricted and reduced. This is one aspect. On the other hand, state allocation is gradually expanding, both in terms of quantity and scope. Does allowing the existence of commodity production and commodity circulation under the socialist system, and allowing its development and expansion in quantity, mean developing capitalism? No. Commodity production has served slave society, commodity production has also served feudal society, and commodity production has served capitalist production and the profits of capitalists. Under the socialist system, commodity production can also serve socialist construction without developing capitalism. Because under the socialist system, the private ownership of the means of production has been eliminated, the means of production are owned by the whole people or collectively, labor is no longer a commodity, and the relationship of employment no longer exists. Workers and peasants no longer work for capitalists and landlords or rich peasants, but for themselves. The profits generated in commodity production and circulation are no longer owned by the exploiting classes, but by the whole people, and at the same time, they receive their due share according to the principle of "to each according to his work." How can this generate capitalism? It will not. Commodity production cannot exist and function independently of social and economic conditions. Commodity production is linked to capitalist economic conditions and develops capitalism; it is linked to socialist economic conditions and develops socialism. Our country has basically completed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, small merchants and peddlers, agriculture, and handicrafts economically, eliminating landlords and rich peasants. The capitalist economy and the economic basis on which capitalism depends for its development have long been eliminated. How can commodity production still lead to capitalism? This is impossible. Our commodity production is socialist commodity production, and commodity production can serve socialist economic construction and become a powerful tool for promoting socialist production development.

The article then said: Appropriately developing commodity production at present makes our production and life richer and more colorful. It enables the members of the commune to receive a certain amount of wages in addition to self-sufficiency and supply. What if commodity production is abolished? Either mandatory allocation will be enforced, which, as mentioned earlier, would mean the expropriation of the communes and would drag the peasants into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat, or there would be neither allocation nor exchange and circulation, and our communes would live a primitive self-sufficient life, which is of course inconceivable. Can the consumer goods in industrial products, which are produced by the working class (except for commune industry), be allocated without being treated as commodities? It is also not possible, because there are too few things, and it is impossible to allocate them reasonably through unified allocation and distribution. Unreasonable distribution affects people's lives and may even bring chaos to the order of life. This will seriously affect production, and even make it impossible to maintain normal production order. Therefore, commodity production also has a great positive effect on industrial production.

Commodity production, the law of value, monetary economy, and the wage system under the principle of "to each according to his work" are closely related. It is impossible for them to exist or disappear independently. These issues exist and function in the transition from socialism to communism. Only after products are very abundant, there are conditions for implementing the principle of distribution "to each according to his needs," and all means of production are owned by the whole people, and the central organization has the right to dispose of all products, can these things gradually lose their function and withdraw from the stage of history.

Commune Production Should Not Overemphasize Self-Sufficiency

The tenth issue of the "Masses" semi-monthly, published on the 16th, published an article by Comrade Jin Xun entitled "On the Self-Sufficient Production and Commodity Production of People's Communes." The article said: The part of the production of the people's communes that is used to meet their own needs is production of a self-sufficient nature; the part of the production that is used to meet the needs of the state and various aspects is production of a commodity nature throughout the entire period of socialist construction. In developing production, the people's communes must develop both the self-sufficient part and the commodity part; and in order to adapt to this situation, the communes must not only do a good job in the internal supply of products, but also do a good job in the buying, selling, and transporting of commodities.

Why should the people's communes develop commodity production while developing self-sufficient production? Wouldn't it be better if everything could be self-sufficient? Of course, with the establishment of communes, many kinds of production can be greatly developed, and many kinds of products can be gradually self-sufficient, which is all very good. However, it is impossible for a commune to be self-sufficient in everything, nor should the development of production be limited to the extent of self-sufficiency. In order to increase production at a high speed, in terms of means of production, electrification and large-scale mechanical equipment must be manufactured by specialized factories, timber and moso bamboo need to be mutually adjusted between regions, petroleum and coal need to be extracted by national mines, and modern transportation tools also need to be supplied by the state. In order to improve life, in terms of means of subsistence, it is even more necessary to be rich and colorful, from food and clothing to daily necessities to high-end consumer goods, and it is impossible for a commune to produce everything. Therefore, if self-sufficiency is overemphasized, the result will inevitably hinder the development of commune production and the improvement of the lives of the members. During the period of socialist construction, the idea and practice of not wanting to develop commodity production and planning to achieve self-sufficiency in everything within a commune is wrong.

Then, would it not be simple and easy to change the method of commodity trading between the state and the people's communes to the method of direct allocation and distribution of products, that is, the state issues orders, mobilizes people, and takes things over? It seems that it is less troublesome not to calculate prices and not to use banknotes, and the state issues an order to allocate and distribute various products; but during the period of socialist construction, before the complete realization of comprehensive ownership by the whole people and the implementation of the distribution system of to each according to his needs, doing so would bring extremely serious problems. Of course, state-owned enterprises are owned by the whole people, and there is no problem in implementing the state's orders to allocate products without compensation. However, at present, the people's communes are collectively owned (containing some elements of ownership by the whole people), and the means of production of the people's communes are collectively owned by the communes, so the products of the communes are also collectively owned by the communes. Before the realization of commune industrialization and agricultural factoryization, the products of the communes are not very abundant; when the state needs to take these products away, the members of the people's communes will ask: Is it to each according to his needs? If it is not possible, then what will be exchanged, how much will be exchanged, and is it cost-effective for the commune? Therefore, it is necessary to compare and calculate prices (what is the calculation standard without calculating prices); and the commune also has the right to disagree with the exchange. The needs of the communes are also diverse, and when the entire social product is not very abundant, is it possible to achieve "have whatever you want"? Some people may also think this way: Since the state issues orders to allocate products, it is not allowed to bargain, and it is not allowed to ask for compensation. If this is done, it is a fundamental denial of the collective ownership of the communes. This is a dangerous idea that violates the Party's line and policy. Then, will the development of commodity production revive capitalism? Marx said: "The two phenomena of commodity production and commodity circulation are common to many modes of production, although they differ in scope and importance." Our current commodity trading exists between the state and the communes, between the communes and the communes, between the state and the people, and between the communes and consumers; the enterprises that produce commodities are all socialist in nature, and the socialist commerce is responsible for forming the national commodity circulation. Will such commodity production and commodity circulation revive capitalism? Commodity production and commodity circulation under the socialist system are used to directly serve socialist construction throughout the entire period of socialist construction. Now, our commodity production is not excessive, but greatly insufficient. For the people's communes, in addition to developing self-sufficient production, it is necessary to develop commodity production at the same time in order to increase income, increase accumulation, improve the lives of members, and give greater play to the labor enthusiasm of the members.

Developing Commodity Production is an Objective Law

The "Academic Monthly" published in its twelfth issue an article entitled "The Development and Demise of Commodity Production and Commodity Exchange." The author said: Commodity exchange is an indispensable and important factor in economic life at a certain stage in the development of human history. In socialist society, it is still necessary to continue to maintain and develop commodity production and commodity exchange, because: First, socialist society still has two forms of social production, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, in order to connect cities and villages, production and production, and production and consumption. It is still necessary to continue to maintain commodity production and commodity exchange. Obviously, under the conditions of the coexistence of two ownership systems, the state can only control the products of state-owned enterprises. As for the products of the people's communes, they are still collectively owned by the members of the communes. Under these conditions, the objective necessity of commodity production and commodity exchange has not disappeared, but continues to be maintained within a certain range. Only in this way can the commune's interest in commodity production be aroused, and diversified operations can be engaged in, increasing the volume of commodities, enabling social production to develop rapidly, and facilitating the high development of the social economy, thereby meeting the growing needs of society. Some people think that we are about to transition to communism soon, and therefore think that commodity production and commodity exchange will soon disappear, and some communes have formulated work plans according to this view, only preparing to set up a finance department to replace the work of commerce and banks, which violates objective laws and is unrealistic.

Second, the objective existence of commodity production is also determined by the socialist distribution principle of "to each according to his work." Judging from the current level of production and the level of consciousness of the masses, the principle of "to each according to his work" is still the basis of our country's social distribution system on a national scale. Therefore, settling and paying labor remuneration and exchanging means of subsistence through the monetary form still occupy a very important position, which makes commodity production, commodity circulation, and the "monetary economy" have objectively existing conditions. Some comrades believe that the larger the part of the commune's supply, the more communism there is, the more advanced it is, and therefore, they are enthusiastic about expanding the "package" items, thinking that they can quickly abandon the distribution system of "to each according to his work," thinking that they can quickly eliminate commodity exchange, which is also unrealistic. The purpose of socialist development of production is to meet the growing needs of the people. It must not be assumed that the tendency of the supply system is "uniformization," and freedom of choice must be given. That is to say, at this stage, not everything can be distributed directly in kind, and most consumer goods must be obtained through the monetary form as a medium to obtain personal consumption quotas.

Third, social distribution is always determined by the level of social productive forces. In order to gradually transition collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, in order to gradually replace the distribution principle of "to each according to his work" with the principle of "to each according to his needs," the primary task is to develop social productive forces at a high speed and reach a state of extreme abundance of social products. The people's communes must both develop self-sufficient production to meet the needs of the commune and develop commodity production needed by the whole society as widely as possible. The two cannot be neglected and must complement each other. The so-called extreme abundance of social products is from the national scope. From the perspective of a region or a commune, due to the limitation of natural conditions, it is impossible to require all needs to achieve self-sufficient production, so the form of exchange must be maintained. The current form of exchange is generally dominated by commodity exchange. Socialist commodity production and commodity exchange have special properties and cannot be equated with commodity production in capitalist society. This kind of commodity production and commodity exchange is carried out under the correct use of the law of value and the limitation of its destructive effect, and is to serve the acceleration of socialist construction. The idea that this kind of commodity production will develop capitalism is wrong.

    让商品生产也为社会主义服务
    理论刊物摘要
    商品生产还有重大作用
    10日出版的长江半月刊刊载了王光远的文章：“论商品生产和价值法则在当前的作用”。文章在提出有一部分人认为商品生产已经没有存在必要的错误观点之后说：既然人民公社现在还是社会主义性质，公社的财产仍然是集体所有制，不是全民所有制，那么它的产品就不能进行无条件的调拨。既然不能进行无条件的调拨，商品生产、商品流通就不能消灭；商品流通的工作部门——商业部门就不是可有可无；作为社会主义生产中计算工具的价值法则的作用就不能消失。我们能否马上就宣布公社的财产为全民所有，实行无条件的全国性调拨，并取消商品生产和商品流通呢？不行的。要马上这样办，就会犯盲动性的“左”倾冒险主义的错误。须知人民公社的社员不久前还是小生产者，马克思主义者认为工人阶级对小生产者是不能剥夺的。就是在合作化以后，以及公社化以后，国家在征购粮棉以及收购其他农副产品上，也是经常存在着征购多少的矛盾的。如果现在马上实行无条件的调拨，取消贸易，取消交换，这是农民目前不能接受的。在生产大跃进当中，在人民公社运动中，农民的政治觉悟是大大提高了。但是，如果认为农民的政治觉悟已经提高到和工人阶级一样了，可以马上改变集体所有制为全民所有制，马上接受调拨，这是不对的。所以商品生产和商品流通现在仍然是从经济上团结五亿农民的主要方法，仍然是巩固工农联盟所不可缺少的东西。再说，虽然农业获得大丰收，工业生产大跃进，但是总起来说，我们的社会产品还是不丰富的，“一穷二白”的状况并未根本摆脱。我们还没有取消商品，实行全国调拨，统一分配的物质基础。没有很丰富的社会产品，如何能做到统一分配“各取所需”呢？所以取消商品生产，实行全国统一分配，一方面是农民目前不答应，不同意；另一方面是由于社会产品很不丰富，国家也不可能取消“按劳取酬”的工资制度，而代之以“各取所需”的统一分配。因此，商品生产、商品流通在目前不是取消的问题，而是随着生产发展扩大的问题。当然，这里所说的扩大，是指的量的扩大，不是范围的扩大。就其范围来讲，商品生产和商品流通是逐步被限制和缩小的。这是一方面。另一方面，国家调拨，无论就其数量来讲，还是就其范围来讲，都是逐步扩大的。在社会主义制度下允许商品生产、商品流通存在，并允许其在数量上发展与扩大，是不是就意味着发展资本主义呢？不是的。商品生产为奴隶社会服过务，商品生产也为封建社会服过务，商品生产为资本主义生产，为资本家的利润服过务，在社会主义制度下商品生产同样可以为社会主义建设服务，而不发展资本主义。因为在社会主义制度下，已经消灭了生产资料的私有制，生产资料为全民或集体所有，劳动力不再是商品，雇佣关系已不存在。工人、农民不再为资本家和地主、富农劳动，而是为自己劳动，在商品生产和流通中所产生的利润不再为剥削阶级所有，而是为全民所有，同时他按“按劳取酬”的原则取得他们自己应得的一份。这样，怎么会产生资本主义呢？不会的。商品生产不能离开社会经济条件而独立存在和发生作用。商品生产和资本主义的经济条件相联系，就发展资本主义；和社会主义的经济条件相联系，就发展社会主义。我国已经在经济上基本上完成了资本主义工商业、小商小贩、农业和手工业的改造，消灭了地主和富农，资本主义经济以及资本主义赖以发展的经济基础早已被排除，商品生产怎么还会引导到资本主义呢？这是不可能的。我们的商品生产是社会主义的商品生产，商品生产可以为社会主义经济建设服务，成为促进社会主义生产发展的有力的工具。
    文章接着说：目前适当地发展商品生产，就使我们的生产和生活更加丰富多采。使社员们除自给和供给部分外，还可以得到一定数额的工资。如果取消商品生产将如何呢？要么就强制实行调拨，前面已经说过，这将意味着对公社的剥夺，会把农民拖到无产阶级的敌人的阵营中去，要么就是既不调拨，也不进行交换和流通，让我们公社还过原始的自给自足的生活，这当然是不可思议的。工业产品中的消费资料，是工人阶级生产的（除公社工业以外），可否不作为商品而实行调拨呢？同样不行，因为东西少，统一调拨分配是没办法分配合理的。分配不合理，就影响人们的生活，甚至因此而带来生活秩序上的混乱。这就不能不严重影响生产，甚至使维持正常的生产秩序成为不可能。所以，商品生产对工业生产也是有很大的积极作用的。
    商品生产、价值法则、货币经济、“按劳取酬”原则下的工资制，这些问题是有密切关系的。不可能分离开来独立地存在或消失。这几个问题都是在社会主义向共产主义过渡时期中存在并发生作用的。必须在产品非常丰富，有条件实行“各取所需”的分配原则之后，必须在一切生产资料均为全民所有，中央组织有权支配一切产品之后，这些东西才能逐步地消失了它们作用，退出历史舞台。
    公社生产不应过份强调自给自足
    在16日出版的“群众”半月刊第十期上，发表了金逊同志写的“论人民公社的自给生产与商品生产”一文。文章说：人民公社用于满足自己需要的这一部分的生产，是属于自给性质的生产；用于满足国家及各个方面需要的这一部分的生产，在社会主义建设的整个时期内，是属于商品性质的生产。人民公社发展生产，既要发展自给的部分，又要发展商品的部分；并且为了适应这一情况，公社不仅要做好产品的内部供给工作，还得要做好商品的买卖调运工作。
    人民公社在发展自给性质的生产同时，为什么还要发展商品性质的生产呢？能够样样都自给自足不是很好么？当然，有了公社以后，许多种生产可以大大发展，许多种产品可以逐步自给，这都是很好的。但是，在一个公社要做到一切东西都自给则是不可能的，也不应该把生产的发展仅仅限制在自给自足的限度以内。为了高速度地增产，在生产资料方面，电气化和大型的机械设备必须有专门工厂制造，木材和毛竹等等也需要在地区之间相互调剂，石油和煤炭等等需要由国家的矿山开采，现代化的交通运输工具也需要国家供应。为了改善生活，在生活资料方面，更要丰富多彩，从吃的穿的到用的，从日常必需品到高级消费品，一个公社也不可能样样生产。因此，如果过份强调自给自足，其结果必然阻碍公社的生产发展和社员的生活改善。在社会主义建设时期，那种不想发展商品生产，打算在一个公社内做到样样都自给自足的思想和做法是错误的。
    那末，在国家和人民公社之间不采取商品买卖的办法，改变为产品直接调拨分配的办法，即由国家下命令，动员一下，把东西拿过来，岂不是干干脆脆、简单易行吗？看起来，不要算价钱，不要用钞票，国家下一个命令来调拨分配各种产品，似乎是很省事；但在社会主义建设时期，在完全实现全面的全民所有制以前和实行各取所需的分配制度以前，如果这样做了，却会带来极严重的问题。当然，国营企业是全民所有制，无代价地执行国家的调拨产品的命令是没有问题的。但在目前，人民公社是集体所有制（其中包含有一些全民所有制的成分），人民公社的生产资料是属于公社集体所有，因此公社的产品也属于公社集体所有。在没有实现公社工业化、农业工厂化以前，公社的产品还不十分丰富；当国家需要拿走这些产品的时候，人民公社的社员们就会问：是不是各取所需？如果不可能，那末换什么东西，换多少，对公社合算不合算？于是，就要比比看，就要算算价钱（不算价钱又以什么为计算标准呢）；而且公社还有权不同意交换。公社的需要又是多种多样的，当整个社会产品还不是十分丰富的时候，能够办到“要什么，有什么”吗？也可能有人这样想：既然是由国家下命令调拨产品，就不许讲价钱，不许要代价。如果这样做，那就是根本否认公社的集体所有制。这是违反党的路线、政策的一种危险想法。那么发展商品生产会不会复活资本主义呢？马克思说过：“商品生产与商品流通这两种现象，是许多种生产方式所共有的，虽然在范围和重要性上是不等的”。我们现在的商品买卖存在于国家公社之间、公社和公社之间、国家和人民之间、公社和消费者之间；生产商品的企业都是属于社会主义性质的，负责组成全国商品流通的也是社会主义商业。这样的商品生产和商品流通会让资本主义复活吗？社会主义制度下的商品生产和商品流通，在整个社会主义建设时期内，是被利用来直接为社会主义建设服务的。现在，我们的商品生产还不是过多，而是大大不够。对于人民公社来说，除了发展自给性质的生产以外，必须同时发展商品生产，才能增加收入，增加积累，改善社员生活，更大地发挥社员的劳动积极性。
    发展商品生产是客观规律
    “学术月刊”第十二期发表了“商品生产和商品交换的发展和消亡问题”一文，作者说：商品交换在人类历史发展的一定阶段中是经济生活中一个必不可少的重要因素。在社会主义社会，商品生产和商品交换也还有继续保持和发展的必要，因为：第一，社会主义社会，还同时存在着全民所有制和集体所有制两种社会生产形式，为了城市和乡村、生产和生产、生产和消费之间的联系，还要继续保持商品生产和商品交换。显然的，在两种所有制同时并存的条件下，国家所能支配的只是国营企业的产品，至于人民公社的产品，还是为公社社员集体所占有的。在这种条件下，商品生产和商品交换的客观必要性并没有消失，而是在一定的范围内继续保持着。也只有这样，才能引起公社对商品生产的兴趣，从事多种经营，增加商品量，使社会生产得到迅速的发展，有利于社会经济的高度发展，从而满足社会日益增长的需要。有人以为马上就要向共产主义过渡了，因而认为商品生产和商品交换很快就会消亡了，有的公社并按照这种观点来拟制工作规划，只准备设立一个财政部门来代替一下商业和银行的工作，这是违反客观法则的，不现实的。
    第二，商品生产之客观存在，还由于社会主义的分配原则是“按劳取酬”所决定的。从目前的生产水平和群众觉悟程度来看，“按劳取酬”的原则，就全国范围来说，仍然是我国社会分配制度的基础。因此，通过货币形态来结算和支付劳动报酬以及换取生活资料仍然占有极重要的地位，这就使商品生产和商品流通以及“货币经济”具有客观存在的条件。有的同志认为公社供给的部分越大，就是共产主义越多，就越先进，因此，热心于扩大“包”的项目，以为可以很快抛弃“按劳取酬”的分配制度，以为可以很快消灭商品交换，这也是不现实的。社会主义发展生产的目的，是为了满足人们日益增长的需要。决不能设想实行供给制的趋向是“单一化”，必须给予选择的自由。这就是说，现阶段还不能什么都采用物质直接分配的方式，必然有大部分生活消费品采用货币形态作为媒介取得个人消费额。
    第三，社会分配总是由社会生产力水平决定的。为着使集体所有制逐步地过渡到全民所有制，为着使“按劳取酬”的分配原则逐步地为“各取所需”的原则所代替，首要的任务就是高速度地发展社会生产力，达到社会产品极大丰富的境地。人民公社既要发展为满足本社需要的自给性生产，又要尽可能地广泛发展整个社会需要的商品性生产，两者不可偏废，必须相辅而行。所谓社会产品极大地丰富，是从全国范围来说的，从一个地区、一个公社来说，由于自然条件的限制，不可能要求全部需要达到自给性生产的，因而必须保持交换形式。而当前的交换形式，一般地说还是以商品交换形式占主要地位的。社会主义的商品生产和商品交换具有特殊的性质，不能与资本主义社会的商品生产等同看待，这种性质的商品生产和商品交换是在正确利用价值规律和限制它的破坏作用下进行的，是为加速社会主义建设服务的。认为这种商品生产会发展资本主义的想法是错误的。
