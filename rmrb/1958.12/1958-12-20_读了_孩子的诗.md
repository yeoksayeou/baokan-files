Reading "Children's Poems"
Guo Moruo

The eighth page of the "People's Daily" (December 18, 1958) had a set of "Children's Poems," which I read. I agree with the editor's words, they are truly "promising youngsters." Among the twelve poems, one called "Little Author" specifically mentioned me. The poem is:

	"Don't look down on the little author,
	He writes a lot of poems,
	一心超过杜甫诗，
    快马加鞭赶郭老”.
	He's determined to surpass Du Fu's poems,
	And whip the horse to catch up with Old Guo."

It was written by Liu Yuhua, a first-year student at the Workers and Peasants Middle School. Especially the third line, its ambition is truly great. The editor believes that these young authors will "surpass our generation of poets," and asks me "what do I think?" I must honestly answer: I completely agree, they will certainly surpass us, especially me. Therefore, I wrote a poem to reply to that little author:

	"Old Guo is not old,
	Many poems, few good;
	Young and old work together,
	Study Chairman Mao!"

Studying Chairman Mao's poems, I think that little author will definitely agree with my suggestion. Of course, my suggestion is for all poets, and I believe everyone will also agree.

However, among the twelve "Children's Poems," one is problematic, which is the one called "Enough for the Sun to Shine On for a Few Days." It is from plagiarism. I will write a Sichuan Naxi County folk song and this "children's poem" together below, and you can see.

	"Sichuan Folk Song"
	The commune has several thousand people,
	Many people, great strength, will surely conquer nature.
	Each person swings down a drop of sweat,
	Enough for the sun to shine on for three days.
	(Already selected into "Red Flag Ballads")

	"Children's Poem"
	The commune has thousands upon thousands of members,
	Many people, great strength, surpass heaven.
	Each person sheds a drop of sweat,
	Enough for the sun to shine on for a few days.

These two are basically the same, only a few words have been changed. Children are good at imitation, so this may not be considered plagiarism, but I don't think it's good to bring it out for commendation.

Recently, in the folk songs of the Great Leap Forward, there is often this tendency, that is, copying folk songs from other places, changing a few words and pretending they are their own. The output of folk songs is so large, no one can see them all, so they are often mixed up, and therefore selected or praised. This is really not an honest style. Children can be forgiven, but adults absolutely cannot!

### 读了“孩子的诗”

    读了“孩子的诗”
    郭沫若
    “人民日报”（1958年12月18日）第八版有一组“孩子的诗”，我读了。我同意编者的话，真是“后生可爱”。十二首里面有一首叫“小作者”特别提到了我，那诗是：
      “别看作者小，
    诗歌可不少，
    一心超过杜甫诗，
    快马加鞭赶郭老”。
    是工农中学一年级刘玉花作的，特别是第三句，气魄可真不小。编者认为这些小作者是会“超过我们这一代的诗人的”，问我“以为如何”？我要老老实实地回答：我完全同意，他们一定会超过我们，特别是超过我。因此，我作了一诗来答复那位小作者：
      “老郭不算老，
    诗多好的少；
    老少齐努力，
    学习毛主席！”
    向毛主席的诗学习，我想那位小作者一定会同意我这个建议的。当然，我这个建议是向所有的诗人们的建议，我相信大家也一定会同意。
    但在十二首“孩子的诗”中，有一首可有问题，就是“也够太阳晒几天”的那一首。那是出于抄袭。我把四川南溪县的一首民歌和这首“孩子的诗”一并写在下边，便可以看出。
        “四川民歌”
    社里人口好几千，
    人多力大定胜天。
    每人挥下一滴汗，
    也够太阳晒三天。
    （已选入“红旗歌谣”）
          “孩子的诗”
    公社社员千千万，
    人多力大胜过天。
    每人流下一滴汗，
    也够太阳晒几天。
    这两首基本上相同，只是改了几个字。孩子们是善于摹仿的，这样或许不能算是抄袭，但我觉得不好拿来表彰。
    近来在大跃进的民歌中往往有这种倾向，即是把别处的民歌抄来，改头换面的换几个字便作为自己的东西。民歌的产量既多，谁也不能普遍看到，因此往往被混过，更因而被选或被称赞。这样实在是不太老实的作风。孩子可恕，大人断不可恕！
