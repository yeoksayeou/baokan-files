    African Peoples Fight for National Liberation

    Cameroonian Writer Ben Zamin · Matipu

    The liberation process of Asian and African countries, formerly enslaved by Western European countries, will surely be recorded in history as one of the remarkable events of the second half of the twentieth century. This irresistible movement that arose in Asia has now swept across the African continent.

    There are already nine independent countries on the African continent: the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Ethiopia, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, the Republic of Guinea, and Liberia. Not long ago, Ghana and Guinea decided to unite and establish the core of the West African Federation. However, two-thirds of Africa remains under imperialist rule. This vast land is occupied by colonialists and divided into many colonies, "protectorates," and "protected territories."

    The activities of colonialists devastating and plundering the African people have continued for six hundred years. They once hunted people (men, women, and children) and sent them to the Americas as slaves, creating the social, economic, and moral conditions for the colonialists' rule in Africa. Western European colonialists, during the period from 1800 to 1910, spread the seeds of death and despair throughout the vast African continent, and adventurers like Rhodes, after launching devastating military operations, placed the colonial yoke on the African people.

    At present, it is difficult to fully understand the scale of imperialist plunder of Africa, because imperialists prefer to carry out such plunder secretly, without publicly publishing any detailed statistics. However, for example, 98.6% of Africa's diamonds are seized by imperialists, and more than 80% of the capitalist world's cobalt, more than half of its gold, and about 40% of its chromium are taken from Africa.

    It must also be pointed out that the Congo Basin (Belgian Congo, Gabon, Middle Congo) and the Drakensberg Mountain Valley – Orange River Basin (Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa) are the main areas where French, Belgian, and British atomic enterprises rely on uranium and other uranium-containing ores.

    Most of the raw materials plundered from Africa are transported to Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal, Spain. This brings the monopolists fabulous profits, with profit margins as high as 50%.

    In recent years, American monopoly capital has played an increasingly important role in the plunder of Africa. The penetration of American capital into Africa is strengthening day by day.

    It is hard to imagine a more miserable situation than that of African colonial workers. For example, in the Belgian Congo, the working day lasts from ten to twelve hours. Workers' wages are meager, and their families are starving. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Belgian Catholic Trade Union Federation, Kailisi, once visited the Belgian Congo. According to his admission, 60% of the African residents of Leopoldville (the capital of the Belgian Congo) are starving. According to official statistics, each resident of the Belgian Congo has an average of only half a kilogram of meat per year.

    Most parts of Africa are the arena for the combined forces of brutal racial discrimination, systematic plunder, political fraud, and bribery using francs, dollars, and pounds. And all of this is united by one word: colonialism.

    Imperialism is digging its own grave with its lawless and despicable deeds.

    We have witnessed the widespread awakening of the African people and the rise of powerful mass movements. The program of this movement can be expressed in a simple and clear formula: national independence.

    Since the conquest of Africa, the African people have constantly launched struggles for liberation on a large and small scale.

    During the global anti-fascist struggle, a powerful anti-colonialist trend was born and developed. While the Soviet Union was waging an irreconcilable struggle to eradicate colonial oppression, American imperialism only wanted to squeeze France and other capitalists out of the areas of capitalist plunder. After the war, we saw many facts proving that the notorious American "anti-colonialism" was nothing but a deceptive guise. In all the votes at the United Nations concerning colonial issues (Algeria, Cameroon, etc.), when it was necessary to overturn the national demands of enslaved countries, the United States always automatically voted the same way as Britain, France, and Belgium.

    The post-war anti-colonialist trend has continued to strengthen, whether in Asia or Africa. Hundreds of thousands of Africans fought against fascism in the armies of Britain, France, and Belgium. However, even in the army, they were still slaves of the colonialists. Even bourgeois statisticians admit that during the war from 1939 to 1945, the mortality rate of colonial troops reached a record high of 80%.

    It is extremely despicable to drive African troops to participate in colonial suppression activities. In Algeria, Cameroon, and Kenya, imperialism is everywhere forcing Africans to kill Africans.

    However, people's hatred for the colonial system is growing, and their contempt for the exploiters, who once thought they had brought their notorious so-called "civilization" to Africa, has deepened.

    It can be said that the victory of the anti-fascist war in World War II created objective conditions for the liberation of the people in Asia and Africa who had suffered cruel enslavement by international imperialism. This is a lesson worth pondering by the imperialist warmongers!

    As for the internal reasons that have stimulated the development of national liberation movements in recent years, they are mainly the excessive exploitation of the colonies, the lack of political rights for most Africans, racism, and racial segregation.

    Imperialism, which suffered a disastrous defeat in Asia and was almost completely driven out, is trembling in the face of the growing African national liberation movement. Imperialism spares no effort to try to retain its position. They are still massacring and arresting African patriots in large numbers, subjecting them to exile and severe torture.

    For example, in 1945, the people of Douala in Cameroon suffered bloody and terrible persecution during a strike, which lasted for a week. Unarmed civilians were subjected to armed attacks, and thousands of people were killed. Two years later, French imperialism carried out a bloody suppression in Madagascar, with as many as 90,000 victims. Madagascan parliamentarians and patriots were thrown into prison. Patriots engaged in struggle in Nigeria, Tanganyika, and other colonies have also been subjected to the same large-scale suppression.

    The African people responded to these armed provocations with resolute struggle. During the four years from 1952 to 1956, the people of Kenya waged a heroic struggle against the British regular colonial army. Cameroon entered a stage of armed struggle against French oppressors.

    Colonialists established pseudo-governments led by Africans in various colonies; provided sham "autonomy"; fostered political parties that had essentially nothing in common with the interests of the people; and tried their best to buy off the leaders of political parties. One such "leader," Mr. Houphouët-Boigny, is now a minister in De Gaulle's ultra-colonialist government.

    Imperialism, unwilling to abandon the old principle of "divide and rule," is trying to use such methods to suppress the national consciousness of Africans and stifle the revolutionary forces that are flourishing throughout the African continent. However, this is a futile effort.

    It is also necessary to mention another trick currently being played by colonialists. They talk to us about the formation of a "community" and the implementation of "union" between Europe and Africa. However, this is actually the rule of the colonialists, their "legalized" tyranny.

    If we agree to form such a "community" under colonial oppression, it would be tantamount to allowing imperialism to plunder our national wealth in the future, to hinder our development by relying on outdated conventions that are obviously behind the times; it would be tantamount to hanging a sign on the building created by Africans that says "No Blacks Allowed." This would be tantamount to willingly lagging behind other peoples advancing along the road of progress like a cripple with incomplete limbs. This would be tantamount to willingly maintaining the illiteracy rate of 80% among Africans. This would be tantamount to allowing politicians and imperialist lackeys to sell out the motherland, to sell out our personality and our wealth.

    No, we will say a thousand no's! This is the answer of all the African people from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sahara, from Dakar to Dar es Salaam.

    We cannot yet present the imperialists with an indictment drawn up according to all the rules, accusing them of their crimes in Africa. History will make such a decision.

    However, now that the world has entered the era of conquering outer space, we Africans must eradicate all traces of the six hundred years of slave trade and colonial slavery, we must break free from all shameful chains, eliminate Africa's serious backwardness, and mobilize all of Africa's human, economic, and natural resources to serve the African people.

    We can no longer wait for the day when imperialism and its agents bestow upon us a bit of independence and national dignity that Heaven knows when; we can no longer have such naive ideas that the insignificant reforms bestowed by colonialists can restore our African homeland to the position it deserves in the international community.

    Colonial reformism - this is a deception that can only further tighten the screws of the colonial system.

    Our highest purpose is to fight for the personality, honor, and progress of Africans and the African homeland.

    Not long ago, colonialists depicted India, Indonesia, Egypt, Sudan, and other countries as politically naive and incapable of self-government. These newly born countries, after breaking free from the shackles of colonial slavery, are advancing along the road of consolidating independence, and their prestige on the international stage is increasing day by day.

    About fifty years ago, the Soviet Union, which was born in a country that had suffered from the oppression of the Tsarist system and international capital, was still a backward country. Now, everyone knows that it is the greatest power in the world, and Britain, France, and other Western countries are far behind. The African territories south of the Sahara are slightly larger than the Soviet Union in terms of area, and they possess enormous natural wealth. Once the peoples of southern Africa break free from the shackles of decadent capitalism and brutal imperialism, can they not embark on the great road that the Soviet Union opened up fifty years ago?

    Recent experience has shown that people who stand up and fight to break free from colonial bondage will always receive support in consolidating their independence.

    Countries similar to our own, which have suffered from imperialist oppression in body and spirit, declared their firm determination at the Bandung Conference to help the peoples of all countries that are still being trampled underfoot by colonialists. Our historical obligation is to respond to the call of the Bandung Conference and reach out to take up the material and spiritual weapons it has given us.

    There are two great socialist powers in the world, the Soviet Union and China, whose policies are firmly based on anti-imperialist principles, and they are determined to help the African peoples who are fighting to liberate themselves from colonial oppression.

    Ten years of struggle to win ten thousand years of peace, a valuable life, and prosperity - this is the slogan of all African patriots. The twentieth century presents Africans with a historical task: to break free from the clutches of the colonial evil tiger, and to achieve Africa's dignity, freedom, strength, and prosperity.

    非洲各族人民为争取民族解放而斗争
    喀麦隆作家  本扎敏·玛蒂普
    从前受西欧国家奴役的亚非各国人民的解放过程，必将作为二十世纪后半期的卓越事件之一而载入史册。在亚洲兴起的这一不可阻挡的运动，如今已席卷了非洲大陆。
    在非洲大陆上已经存在着九个独立国家：阿拉伯联合共和国、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳、几内亚共和国、利比里亚。不久以前，加纳和几内亚决定联合起来，建立了西非联邦的核心。但是，三分之二的非洲，仍然处在帝国主义的统治之下。这一片广大的土地被殖民主义者所霸占，并且被分割为许多的殖民地、“保护国”和“保护领”。
    殖民主义者摧残和掠夺非洲人民的活动，继续了六百年之久。它们曾经猎取人（男子和妇孺），把人们送到美洲去作奴隶；为殖民主义者在非洲的统治创造了社会、经济和道德的条件。西欧殖民主义者在1800年到1910年这段时期里，在整个广漠无垠的非洲大陆上散布着死亡和绝望的种籽，而罗德斯之流的冒险主义者在发动毁灭性的军事行动之后，把殖民枷锁套在非洲人民的身上。
    目前，要完全弄清帝国主义掠夺非洲的规模，是很困难的，因为帝国主义者宁愿偷偷摸摸地干这种掠夺的勾当，而不公开发表任何详细的统计资料。但是，例如非洲的金刚石有98.6％被帝国主义者所攫取，而资本主义世界80％以上的钴、半数以上的黄金和40％左右的铬，都是取自非洲的。
    还必须指出，刚果盆地（比属刚果、加蓬、中部刚果）和德拉科诺夫山河谷——橘河盆地（罗德西亚和南非联邦），是法国、比利时、英国开采原子企业赖以滋养的铀及其它含铀矿石的主要地区。
    大部分从非洲掠夺的原料，都被运到英国、法国、比利时、葡萄牙、西班牙去了。这给垄断资本家带来了神话般的利润，利润率高达50％。
    近年来，美国的垄断资本在掠夺非洲的活动中起着越来越大的作用。美国资本向非洲的渗入，一天天在加强。
    很难想像还有什么比非洲殖民地工人的处境更为悲惨的了。例如，在比属刚果工作日长达十小时到十二小时。工人的工资少得可怜，他们的家人饥肠辘辘。比利时天主教工会联合会副总书记凯列司，曾经访问过比属刚果。据他承认，利奥波尔得维尔（比属刚果首都）的60％非洲籍居民，忍饥挨饿。据官方统计，比属刚果每一个居民每年平均只有半公斤肉。
    非洲的大部分地方，是残暴的种族歧视、系统的掠夺、政治上的欺诈，以及使用法郎、美元、英镑实行贿买的各种联合力量的活动舞台。而这一切都是用一个词儿联合起来的，这就是：殖民主义。
    帝国主义正以其无法无天的卑鄙勾当，为自己挖掘坟墓。
    我们亲眼看到非洲人民普遍地觉醒和强大的群众运动的兴起。这个运动的纲领可以用一个简单明了的公式来表达，这就是：民族独立。
    从非洲被征服的时候起，非洲人民就一直以大大小小的规模不断地为争取解放而掀起斗争。
    在全世界反法西斯斗争的时期，一个强大的反殖民主义的潮流，就已经诞生和发展起来。而在苏联为铲除殖民压迫而进行不可调和的斗争时，美帝国主义却只是想把法国和其它的资本家从资本主义掠夺的地区排挤出去。战后，我们看到有许多事实证明，臭名昭著的美国的“反殖民主义”，无非是一种骗人的幌子而已。在联合国举行有关殖民地问题（阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆等）的一切投票时，当需要推翻被奴役各国的民族要求时，美国一向总是自动地跟英国、法国、比利时投一样的票。
    战后的反殖民主义潮流，无论在亚洲或非洲，都继续加强了。成千上万的非洲人，在英国、法国、比利时的军队中，曾为反法西斯而战。但是，就在军队里他们也还是殖民者的奴隶。甚至资产阶级的统计学家也承认，在1939年到1945年的战争时期，殖民地军队的死亡率竟出现了高达80％这样创纪录的数字。
    驱使非洲籍的军队参加殖民地的镇压活动，是十分卑鄙的事情。在阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆和怯尼亚，帝国主义到处在强迫非洲人来残杀非洲人。
    但是，人们对殖民制度的仇恨在增长，对剥削者的蔑视心理也加深了。剥削者曾经认为，是他们把自己的声名狼借的所谓“文明”带到非洲来的。
    可以说，第二次世界大战中反法西斯的胜利，为亚非两洲曾经遭受国际帝国主义残酷奴役的人民的解放，创造了客观的条件。这个教训值得帝国主义战争贩子老爷们深思！
    至于近年来刺激民族解放运动发展的内部原因，则主要是殖民地的超额剥削、大多数非洲人没有任何政治权利、种族主义和种族隔离。
    在亚洲遭到惨败，几乎完全被赶出来的帝国主义，在日益增长的非洲民族解放运动面前发抖。帝国主义不惜采取任何手段妄图保留自己的阵地。它们仍旧在大批地屠杀和逮捕非洲爱国者，对他们实行流放和严刑拷打。
    譬如，1945年在罢工期间，喀麦隆的杜阿拉人民遭受的血腥恐怖的迫害，长达一个星期之久。手无寸铁的老百姓遭到武装袭击，成千的人被杀害。两年之后，法国帝国主义在马达加斯加进行了一次血腥镇压，牺牲者达九万人之多。马达加斯加的议员和爱国者，被关进了监牢。尼日利亚、坦噶尼喀及其它殖民地从事斗争的爱国者，也遭到了同样的大规模的镇压。
    非洲人民以坚决的斗争回答了这些武装挑衅。在1952年到1956年这四年间，怯尼亚人民同英国正规的殖民军队进行了英勇的斗争。喀麦隆进入了反对法国压迫者的武装斗争阶段。
    殖民主义者在各殖民地建立了由非洲人领导的伪政府；提供冒牌的“自治”；扶植实质上同人民利益毫无共同之处的政党；极力收买政党的领袖。这样的“领袖”之一的乌弗埃—博瓦尼先生，现在当上了戴高乐的极端殖民主义者政府的部长。
    不肯放弃“分而治之”老原则的帝国主义，力图玩弄这一类的手法来压制非洲人的民族觉悟，扼杀在整个非洲大陆蓬勃发展的革命力量。然而，这是枉费心机的。
    还不能不提到目前殖民主义者正在玩弄的另一个手法。他们向我们说到欧洲同非洲结成“共同体”和实行“联合”的事情。但是，这实际上是殖民主义者的统治，是他们的“合法化”的暴政。
    如果同意在殖民压迫条件下结成这一类的“共同体”，就等于今后还允许帝国主义掠夺我们的民族财富，就等于凭借显然落后于时代的陈规来阻挠我们的发展；就等于在非洲人创建的大厦上悬挂一条“不准黑人入内”的标竿。这就等于甘愿像一个四肢不全的残废者跟在其它沿着进步道路前进的人民后面裹足不前。这就等于甘心保持80％的非洲人文盲的状态。这就等于允许政客和帝国主义的走狗们出卖祖国，出卖我们的人格和我们的财富。
    不，我们要说一千个不！这就是从好望角到撒哈拉，从达喀尔到达累斯萨兰姆所有的非洲人民的回答。
    我们还不能向帝国主义者提出按照一切规则拟定的控告它们在非洲的犯罪行为的起诉书。历史会作出这样的决定的。
    但是，在世界已经进入征服星际空间纪元的今天，我们非洲人必须铲除六百年来贩卖奴隶和殖民奴役制的一切遗迹，我们必须挣脱一切羞耻的锁链，消除非洲的严重的落后状态，动员非洲的一切人力、经济和自然资源来为非洲人民服务。
    我们再也不能等待有那么一天，帝国主义及其代理人恩赐给我们天晓得的一点独立和民族尊严；我们再也不能有这样天真的想法，即认为靠殖民主义者恩赐的微不足道的改革就能够使我们非洲人的祖国恢复它在国际社会中理应占有的地位。
    殖民地的改良主义，——这是一种骗局，它只能更加拧紧殖民制度的螺丝钉。
    我们最高的目的，是为非洲人获得人格、荣誉及非洲祖国的进步而斗争。
    不久以前，殖民主义者把印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、苏丹及其它国家描绘成政治上幼稚和没有自治能力的国家。这些新生的国家在挣脱殖民奴役的枷锁后，正沿着巩固独立的道路前进，它们在国际舞台上的威信与日俱增。
    在大约五十年以前，曾经在受过沙皇制度和国际资本压迫的国家里诞生的苏联，还是一个落后的国家。现在，所有的人都知道，它是世界上最伟大的强国，而英国、法国及其它西方国家却望尘莫及。撒哈拉南部的非洲领土，论面积说来比苏联多一点，而且这里拥有巨大的天然财富。难道，南部非洲的各族人民，一旦挣脱腐朽的资本主义和残暴的帝国主义的枷锁后，不能走上五十来年以前苏联所开辟的那条伟大的道路吗？
    近年来的经验证明，挺身而起为挣脱殖民束缚而斗争的人民，在巩固自己的独立方面，总是会得到支持的。
    同我们国家相类似的国家，曾经在肉体和精神上遭受过帝国主义的压迫，它们在万隆会议上宣布了自己的坚定的决心，要帮助仍然被殖民主义者踩在脚下的各国人民。我们的历史义务，就是要响应万隆会议的号召，伸出手来拿起它给我们的物质和精神的武器。
    世界上有苏联、中国这两个伟大的社会主义强国，它们的政策是牢固地建立在反帝原则的基础上，它们决心帮助为从殖民压迫下获得解放而斗争的非洲各国人民。
    用十年斗争来争取万年的和平、有价值的生活和繁荣，——这就是非洲一切爱国者的口号。二十世纪在非洲人面前提出了一项历史任务：从殖民制度恶虎的魔爪下挣脱出来，取得非洲的尊严、自由、强大和繁荣。
