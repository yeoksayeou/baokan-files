Xinhua News Agency Report: British magazines, commenting on the North Atlantic Group Council meeting that concluded on the 18th, pointed out that the meeting was full of sharp contradictions between Western countries. Western leaders were only in agreement on one point: rejecting the Soviet Union's peaceful and constructive proposals regarding the Berlin issue.

　　The Labour Party's "Tribune" weekly wrote, "Western leaders gathered together first to say 'no' to the Soviet proposals, and then began to glare at each other over the free trade area."

　　The weekly expressed doubt as to whether the Western countries' policies of rearming West Germany and stockpiling nuclear weapons were correct, and believed that the meeting completely failed to show that "devastating lessons" had caused Western countries to "wake up" and revise their policies.

　　The "Time and Tide" weekly also talked about the divisions within the North Atlantic Group, believing that the situation reflected at the meeting was "extremely serious." The "Time and Tide" weekly concluded that the North Atlantic Group was no longer adapted to modern conditions and that a broader organization of Western countries should be established.

　　The "Economist" magazine pointed out that the efforts to bridge these divisions at the North Atlantic Group meeting "went in the wrong direction, actually widening these divisions."

　　The magazine said that the British strategy, which caused great resentment in France at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, "did not divide France from its five Common Market partners, but only united these six countries with each other in a cause that they firmly believe is important to them all." The magazine expressed unease about the divisions in capitalist Europe.

　　Parisian bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on the North Atlantic Group Council meeting that ended yesterday on the 19th, expressed disappointment or dissatisfaction with the results of the meeting.

　　"L'Aurore" wrote: Like a play that is too long, everyone gets tired at the end of the meeting. The arguments presented at the end do not arouse people's concern. In the economic field, the debates at the OEEC meeting were sometimes fierce, with both sides deadlocked; while in the study of military issues, people showed little enthusiasm.

　　"L'Aurore" believes that France has not been satisfied on the issue of missile bases or on the issue of participating in the "Atlantic Atomic Club."

　　"Combat" also regretted that British and American representatives did not fully trust de Gaulle's intentions. It pointed out that the British and Americans had no intention of sharing the "main responsibility" or atomic secrets of the North Atlantic Alliance with France. Other member states, especially West Germany and Italy, were also uneasy about France's "grand ambitions." "Combat" concluded: There are still many problems to be solved, many differences to be eliminated, and many obstacles to be overcome.

    北大西洋集团裂缝越缝越大
    西方报刊纷纷指出巴黎会议未能调和矛盾
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：英国一些杂志在评论18日闭幕的北大西洋集团理事会会议时指出，这次会议上充满了西方国家之间的尖锐的矛盾。西方各国的领导人仅仅在一点上是意见一致的，这就是，拒绝苏联关于柏林问题的和平的、建设性的建议。
    工党的“论坛”周刊写道，“西方国家的领导人聚集在一起首先是对苏联的建议喊‘不’，然后就开始为了自由贸易区而互相瞪眼睛。”
    这家周刊表示怀疑西方国家重新武装西德和储备核武器的政策是否正确，并且认为，这次会议完全没有表明，“毁灭性的教训”已经使西方国家“清醒过来”而修改自己的政策。
    “时与潮”周刊也谈到了北大西洋集团内部的分歧，认为在这次会议上所反映出的情况是“极其严重的”。“时与潮”周刊的结论是，北大西洋集团已经不能适应现代的条件，应该建立一个西方国家的更广泛的组织。
      “经济学家”杂志指出，在北大西洋集团会议上弥补这些分裂的努力“竟然搞错了方向，反而使这些分裂扩大了”。
    这家杂志说，在北大西洋公约组织会议上，引起法国很大愤慨的英国策略，“并没有分化法国同它的共同市场的五个伙伴的关系，而只是使这六个国家彼此团结在它们坚定地认为对它们全体都是重要的事业中”。这家杂志表示了对于资本主义欧洲的分裂感到的不安。
    巴黎资产阶级报纸19日在评论昨天结束的北大西洋集团理事会会议时，纷纷对会议结果表示失望或不满。
      “震旦报”写道：像一出太长的戏一样，会议开到最后大家都厌倦了。最后提出的论据引不起人们的关心。在经济方面，欧洲经济合作局会议上的争论有时很激烈，双方相持不下；而在研究军事问题时，人们表现得不热心。
    “震旦报”认为，法国在导弹基地问题上、在参加“大西洋原子俱乐部”问题上都没有得到满足。
    “战斗报”也对英美代表不完全相信戴高乐的意图表示遗憾。它指出，英美根本无意同法国分享北大西洋联盟的“主要责任”或原子秘密。其他成员国，特别是西德和意大利，也对法国的“宏图”感到不安。“战斗报”最后说：还有许多问题有待解决，许多分歧有待消除，许多障碍需要克服。
