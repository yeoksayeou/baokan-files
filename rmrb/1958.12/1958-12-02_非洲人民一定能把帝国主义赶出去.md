"Democratice Korea" Says:
    "Dark Continent" Will Shine Brightly
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 1st: The "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today - "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day" - saying that the African people have raised high the torch of national liberation, and the colonial system is fundamentally crumbling in its last bastion - Africa.
    The commentary said that the struggle against imperialism and colonialism is a struggle to defend peace and national independence, and this struggle is closely linked to the Korean people's struggle to achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland. The commentary said that the Korean people are constantly working to develop cooperative relations with the Asian and African peoples who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and actively support the national liberation movements of the colonial peoples.
    The commentary said that there is no doubt that the common struggle of the Asian and African people, actively supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will defeat the colonialists, and every corner of the African continent, once known as the "Dark Continent," will shine brightly.
Damascus "Al-Nour" Says:
    The Chains of Imperialism Are About to Be Smashed
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, December 1st: "Al-Nour" published an editorial today saying, "The people of Asia and Africa, and all free people in the world, are commemorating this important day today ('Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day') because they believe that the time has come for the African people to smash the chains of imperialism and forever rid themselves of the era of tyranny in which they have long lived."
    The newspaper pointed out that Africa is still the base of imperialism, and many African people are still ruled by imperialist countries, especially Britain, France, Belgium, and Portugal. The newspaper pointed out that the United States supports all these imperialists, fully supports them, and helps them plan various conspiracies to suppress the African nationalist movement. The newspaper also pointed out that "American monopoly capitalists are infiltrating Africa through this support, and are gradually taking the position of American partners, who have weakened and cannot stand in the face of the nationalist movement."
    The newspaper said that the African national liberation movement is supported by the Asian national liberation movement and the great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Due to the heroic struggles of the people of Asian countries for freedom and independence, imperialism has already died in many Asian countries.
    The newspaper finally said that although imperialism spares no effort to use all methods and means—deception, threats, and aggression to suppress the nationalist movement—they will surely get out of Africa and all Asian countries. "In the face of Asian-African solidarity, in the face of the liberation movements of these two continents, no force in the world can stand."
Jakarta Newspapers Say:
    The African National Independence Movement Is Irresistible
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 1st: The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial today, calling on the Indonesian people to support the African people's struggle for independence and democracy until they achieve victory.
    The newspaper pointed out that there is no more horrific dark and sinful history in human history than that written by colonialists on African soil.
    The editorial said that it is the United States that supports the Netherlands in continuing to enslave West Irian, and it is also the United States that supports French and British colonialists in continuing to enslave Africa. However, this precisely shows that the United States has no future. The editorial said that at present, Asia and Africa, together with the socialist camp, have become the central force in the world.
    "Dongxing Daily" also published an editorial today supporting the holding of "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day." The newspaper said that U.S. imperialism is the most brutal and stubborn. The reason why U.S. imperialism wants to interfere in Africa and continue to maintain its colonial rule in Africa is because it has direct economic interests there, and the United States also has military interests there. "Dongxing Daily" also condemned the United States' activities to alienate African countries, trying to weaken the development of African nationalist forces.
    The newspaper pointed out that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure, and the development of the African people's national liberation movement is irresistible.
Vietnamese "People's Daily" Says:
    African People Are Moving Forward Greatly
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 1st: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today entitled "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Immediately," saying that imperialism attempts to imprison the African people in a dark prison forever, but the facts have proved that imperialism cannot stop the African nations from moving forward by leaps and bounds. Imperialism will eventually get out of Africa.
    The editorial said that Africa is several times larger than Europe, and there are countries there with early developed cultures. However, for centuries, Africa's wealth has been in the hands of foreign colonialists, and the African people have had to pay their blood and sweat for Western capitalists to get rich. After World War II, British and French colonialists attempted to cling to Africa. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has intensified its invasion of Africa, attempting to replace Britain and France. U.S. Vice President Nixon's remarks after visiting Africa in early 1957 fully exposed U.S. imperialism's ambitions for Africa.
    The editorial pointed out that the Asian and African nations have a common enemy - imperialism. In the struggle against the common enemy, the Asian and African nations are increasingly uniting closely. The Bandung Conference and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference marked a new stage in the movement of the Asian and African people for united struggle for independence and peace, and the solidarity between them will be further developed on "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day."

    非洲人民一定能把帝国主义赶出去
    “民主朝鲜报”说：
    “黑暗大陆”将大放光芒
    新华社平壤1日电  “民主朝鲜报”在今天——“帝国主义滚出非洲日”——发表评论说，非洲人民高高举起了民族解放的火炬，殖民主义体系在它的最后一个堡垒——非洲也从根本上摇摇欲坠了。
    评论说，反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争就是保卫和平和民族独立的斗争，这个斗争同朝鲜人民为争取和平统一祖国的斗争紧密地联系在一起。评论说，朝鲜人民不断为发展同反对帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争的亚非人民的合作关系而努力，并且积极支持殖民地人民的民族解放运动。
    评论说，毫无疑问，受到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营积极支持的亚非人民的共同斗争，将击败殖民主义者，曾经被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲大陆的每个角落都将放出光芒。
    大马士革“光明报”说：
    帝国主义的锁链就要被粉碎
    新华社大马士革1日电  “光明报”今天发表社论说，“亚洲和非洲各国人民以及全世界所有自由的人民今天（“帝国主义滚出非洲日”）都在纪念这个重要的日子，因为他们相信，非洲人民粉碎帝国主义锁链、永远摆脱他们长期在其中生活的暴政时代的时候已经来到了。”
    这家报纸指出，非洲目前仍然是帝国主义的基地，非洲的许多人民仍然受着帝国主义国家，特别是英国、法国、比利时和葡萄牙的统治。这家报纸指出，美国给所有这些帝国主义撑腰，全力支持它们，帮助它们策划各种阴谋，以镇压非洲的民族主义运动。这家报纸还指出，“美国垄断资本家通过这种支持渗入非洲，并且逐渐占据了美国伙伴的地位，这些伙伴已经衰弱了，在民族主义运动的面前，已经站不住了。”
    这家报纸说，非洲民族解放运动得到亚洲民族解放运动和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大力量的支持。由于亚洲国家人民争取自由和独立的英雄斗争，帝国主义在许多亚洲国家已经死亡了。
    这家报纸最后说，虽然帝国主义不遗余力地使用一切方法和手段——欺骗、威胁和为镇压民族主义运动而进行侵略，但是他们必将滚出非洲和所有亚洲国家。“在亚非团结面前，在这两大洲的解放运动面前，世界上任何力量都是站不住的。”
    雅加达报纸说：
    非洲民族独立运动势不可当
    新华社雅加达1日电  雅加达“人民日报”今天发表社论，号召印度尼西亚人民支持非洲人民争取独立和民主的斗争，直到他们获得胜利为止。
    这家报纸指出，人类历史上再也没有比殖民主义者在非洲土地上写下的黑暗的罪恶历史更为骇人了。
    社论说，支持荷兰继续奴役西伊里安的是美国，支持法国和英国殖民主义者继续奴役非洲的同样也是美国。然而，这就恰恰表明美国是没有前途的。社论说，目前，亚洲和非洲同社会主义阵营一起已经成为世界的中心力量。
    “东星报”今天也发表社论支持举行“帝国主义滚出非洲日”。这家报纸说，美帝国主义是最残暴和最顽固的。美帝国主义之所以要干涉非洲，继续保持它在非洲的殖民统治，是因为它在那里有直接的经济利益，而且美国在那里也有军事上的利益。“东星报”还谴责美国离间非洲各国的活动，试图削弱非洲民族主义力量的发展。
    报纸指出，美帝国主义的阴谋是注定要失败的，非洲人民民族解放运动的发展是势不可当的。
    越南“人民报”说：
    非洲人民正在大步前进
    新华社河内1日电  越南“人民报”今天以“帝国主义立即滚出非洲”为题发表社论说，帝国主义企图把非洲人民永远禁闭在黑暗的牢房里，但是事实已经证明帝国主义阻挠不了非洲各民族大踏步前进。帝国主义终归要滚出非洲的。
    社论说，非洲大于欧洲好几倍，那里有文化发达很早的国家。但几世纪以来，非洲的财富操在外国殖民者的手里，非洲人民要为西方资本家发财致富而付出自己的血汗。第二次世界大战后，英、法殖民者企图死赖在非洲。近几年来，美帝国主义加紧侵入非洲，企图取英、法而代之，美国副总统尼克松在1957年初访问非洲后所发表的言论充分暴露了美帝国主义对非洲的野心。
    社论指出，亚非各民族有着共同的敌人——帝国主义。在反对共同敌人的斗争中，亚非各民族正在日益紧密地团结起来。万隆和亚非人民团结大会两个会议标志着亚非人民为争取独立、和平而团结斗争的运动走上了新的阶段，他们之间的团结关系将在“帝国主义滚出非洲日”中又得到进一步的发展。
