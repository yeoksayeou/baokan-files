　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 14th.  Khaled Bagdash, former Secretary-General of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Party, said that the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, after their direct aggression suffered defeat, are now plotting new conspiracies in an attempt to divide the Arabs and undermine the brotherly relations, cooperation, and unity that are developing among the peoples of Arab countries.

　　Bagdash made lengthy remarks during an interview with a reporter from the Lebanese "News Weekly," which were published in today's "News Weekly." Bagdash also said: "It is impossible to defeat the danger of imperialism without the power of the people."

　　The Communist leader said that the power of the people "should be liberated so that it can act properly, and the only course to be taken is the democratic course."

　　Bagdash then elaborated on the current situation. He said that the danger of imperialism still exists and is even more dangerous and acute than before, because it appears in various forms in various Arab countries.

　　Bagdash further said: "Imperialism is a vicious enemy. It will never abandon its strategic goals in this region—the policy of concluding treaties and establishing military bases and carrying out economic plunder—the policy of firmly establishing imperialist control over the region's oil, and the policy of occupying markets and striving for the infiltration of imperialist capital in various forms from the West into all Arab countries."

　　Bagdash emphasized: "As long as imperialism exists, the brotherly cooperation and unity of the entire Arab ranks remain the main item in the Arab liberation movement; moreover, they remain the main point to be emphasized in the current stage of the Arab unification movement. Anything that affects and damages the unity and cooperation between the peoples of Arab countries must be avoided. Therefore, we say that the Arab unification movement—a movement that arises from the reality of Arab countries—can never be consolidated and developed unless it is based on seeking liberation from imperialism. The Arab liberation movement and the Arab unification movement must be carried out in a truly democratic way to be justified. They must be built on a democratic basis and on a good consideration of the objective conditions historically formed in various Arab countries."

　　He pointed out, "If we want to repel the danger of imperialism, maintain and protect our national independence, and guide the national liberation movement forward, we inevitably need to continuously strengthen our friendly relations with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

### 前叙黎共产党总书记巴格达什指出  帝国主义在策划新的阴谋  阿拉伯人民必须加强团结

    前叙黎共产党总书记巴格达什指出
    帝国主义在策划新的阴谋
    阿拉伯人民必须加强团结
    新华社贝鲁特14日电  前叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党总书记哈立德·巴格达什说，帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，在他们的直接侵略遭受失败后，现在正在策划新的阴谋，企图分裂阿拉伯人和破坏阿拉伯各国人民间正在发展的兄弟关系、合作和团结。
    巴格达什接见黎巴嫩“消息周报”记者发表了长篇谈话，这篇谈话发表在今天的“消息周报”上。巴格达什还说：“除了人民的力量外，不可能击败帝国主义危险。”
    这位共产党领袖说，人民的力量“应当获得解放，以便能够适当地行动，应当采取的唯一方针是民主的方针”。
    巴格达什接着阐明了目前的形势。他说，帝国主义的危险目前仍然存在，而且比以前更加危险和尖锐化了，因为它在各个阿拉伯国家中是以各种不同的形式出现的。
    巴格达什又说：“帝国主义是凶恶的敌人。它永远不会放弃它在这个地区的战略目标——缔结条约和建立军事基地以及进行经济掠夺的政策——牢牢地确立帝国主义对这个地区石油的控制的政策，以及占有市场和为帝国主义资本以各种不同的形式从西方渗入所有阿拉伯国家而努力的政策。”
    巴格达什强调指出：“只要帝国主义还存在，整个阿拉伯队伍的兄弟般的合作和团结仍然是阿拉伯解放运动中的主要项目，此外，它们也仍然是阿拉伯统一运动目前阶段中应当予以强调的主要之点。必须避免影响和损害阿拉伯各国人民之间的团结和合作的任何一件事。为此，我们说，阿拉伯统一运动——从阿拉伯国家的实际中产生的运动——除非以摆脱帝国主义谋求解放为它的基础，否则永远也不能得到巩固的发展。阿拉伯解放运动和阿拉伯统一运动必须用真正的民主方法进行才是正当的。它们必须建立在民主的基础上，以及很好地考虑各阿拉伯国家在历史上形成的客观情况的基础上。”
    他指出，“如果我们要击退帝国主义的危险，要保持和保护我们的民族独立并且引导民族解放运动前进的话，我们不可避免地要不断加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友好关系。”
