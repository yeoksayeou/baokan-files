An Guo County in Hebei Province, while improving people's lives and rectifying rural public canteens, first carried out a comprehensive reform of canteen cooking utensils. After a few days of concentrated effort, they created and promoted 17,183 simple cooking utensils such as simple blowers, vegetable cutters, shredders, dough mixers, noodle makers, and lever steamers.

The An Guo County Party Committee, based on the instructions of the provincial and regional Party committees on improving the lives of the masses and running canteens well, conducted investigations and research on rural canteens. At that time, there were more than 15,000 relatively strong cooks in the county's canteens, but due to the backwardness of cooking utensils, they were still too busy. Not only were there few varieties of food, but meals were often not served on time. Therefore, the masses had opinions. The cooks also reflected: they were tired all day long and still couldn't provide good meals for everyone. After the County Party Committee understood this problem, it decided to mobilize the masses to vigorously reform cooking utensils.

The specific method was that the secretary took the lead, with responsibility assigned at each level. Each township established a cooking utensil reform command, and production teams had guidance groups. In order to gain experience and promote it comprehensively, the County Party Committee first conducted a pilot project in the Rocket Commune’s Lu Jing Brigade in Panggezhuang Township. After this brigade mobilized the masses to create a set of models, it immediately convened a field meeting of more than 500 people, including township party committee secretaries, brigade general branch secretaries, canteen managers, cooks, blacksmiths, and carpenters, to pledge to leap forward in the reform of canteen cooking utensils. At the meeting, experiences were exchanged, techniques were taught, tasks were assigned, and measures were studied. Soon, many communes launched reforms and promotions of cooking utensils. In this work, the county and township party committees also focused on the following key points: (1) Fully mobilize the masses, use local materials, be simple and easy to implement, effective, and gradually improve; (2) Grasp the advanced, break conservatism, and debate the conservative thinking that cooking utensils cannot be greatly reformed; (3) Organize cooks, managers, and experienced commune members, blacksmiths, and carpenters to cooperate and reform together; (4) Organize major inspections and summarize experiences. Because the above key points were grasped, the canteen work was greatly improved, the variety of food was renewed, meals were on time, and the commune members were very satisfied.

    安国县全面改革炊事工具
    河北省安国县在搞好人民生活，整顿农村公共食堂的工作中，首先对食堂炊事工具进行了全面大改革。经过几天的大突击，已创制和推广了简易吹风机、切菜机、擦丝机、和面机、制面食机、杠杆笼屉等炊事工具一万七千一百八十三件。
    安国县委根据省地委关于搞好群众生活、办好食堂的指示，对农村食堂进行了调查研究。当时全县食堂有一万五千多名身体比较壮实的炊事员，但是由于炊事工具落后，还是忙不过来，不仅饭菜花样少，还往往不能按时开饭。因此，群众都有意见。炊事员们也反映：一天累到晚，还不能叫大家吃好饭。县委摸清这个问题后，决定发动群众，大搞炊事工具改革。
    具体做法是书记挂帅，层层包干，各乡成立食堂炊事工具改革指挥部，生产队设有指导小组。为了取得经验，全面推广，县委首先在庞各庄乡火箭社路景大队搞试点。在这个队发动群众搞出了一套样板后，就立即召开乡党委书记、大队总支书记、食堂管理员、炊事员、铁匠、木匠五百多人参加的食堂炊事工具改革跃进誓师现场大会。会上交流了经验，传授了技术，分配了任务，研究了措施。不久很多公社就开展了炊事工具的改革和推广工作。在这个工作中，县乡党委又着重抓住了以下几个关键：（一）充分发动群众，就地取材，简单易举，行之有效，逐步提高；（二）抓先进，破保守，对认为炊事工具不能大改革的保守思想进行了辩论；（三）组织炊事员、管理员和有技术经验的社员、铁木工分工协作，共同改革；（四）组织大检查，总结经验。由于抓住了以上几个关键，食堂工作得到很大改进，饭菜花样翻新，开饭准时，社员十分满意。
