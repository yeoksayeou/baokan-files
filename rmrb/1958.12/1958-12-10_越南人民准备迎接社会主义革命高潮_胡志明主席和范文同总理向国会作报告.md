    When Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the other fifteen members of the presidium walked onto the stage, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic applause. The meeting was declared open with the solemn sound of the national anthem.

    Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, first delivered the opening address and gave a brief report on the work of the National Assembly.

    He outlined the domestic and international environment at the time of this National Assembly meeting, pointing out that both the international and domestic environments were very conducive to the Vietnamese people's construction and struggle for unification.

    Ton Duc Thang said that the main task of this National Assembly session was to discuss and adopt the Three-Year Plan for 1958-1960. He said that the adoption of this plan would bring new encouragement to the people of the whole country, greatly promote the cause of socialist construction in the North, make the North a solid base for the struggle for a unified motherland, and make greater contributions to defending world peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 9th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh made a report on the revision of the Vietnamese Constitution at the Ninth Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly this afternoon.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that after the Eighth Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly, the Constitution Revision Committee drafted the first revised draft of the Constitution. From July 1st, the opinions of National Assembly deputies, heads of various political parties, and people's organizations were solicited on this draft. The solicitation of opinions ended on September 30th.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that during this solicitation of opinions, everyone basically agreed with the content of the draft constitution, and at the same time, put forward some specific supplementary opinions. After studying these opinions, a second revised draft of the constitution will be drawn up. This draft will be submitted to the whole people for discussion in February next year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 9th: Premier Pham Van Dong made a government report on the current situation and tasks at the Ninth Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly this afternoon.

    Pham Van Dong first spoke about the international situation. He pointed out that the world situation is developing in a direction favorable to the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people. Socialist forces, nationalist forces, and forces fighting for peace are defeating and increasingly overcoming the imperialist war forces headed by US imperialism.

    When talking about the domestic situation, Pham Van Dong said that after the end of the economic recovery period, North Vietnam began a period of developing and transforming the national economy in accordance with the socialist path. He said: Starting in 1958, a new revolutionary atmosphere appeared in Vietnam, and a mass movement for socialist revolution was launched in the North. From the countryside to the cities, this movement is developing towards a climax.

    Pham Van Dong said that the emergence of the new revolutionary atmosphere in Vietnam is mainly due to the working people's revolutionary drive under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, the achievements of the construction of fraternal countries, especially the great strides of the Soviet Union and the brilliant victories of the Great Leap Forward in China, have also given us great encouragement.

    When talking about the current tasks of the Vietnamese people, Premier Pham Van Dong said: "The basic task of our entire people at present is to vigorously consolidate the North, so that the North will gradually embark on socialism; at the same time, resolutely struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, in order to achieve national reunification on the basis of independence and democracy through peaceful means, and to establish a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam."

    Pham Van Dong said that in order to realize the socialist revolution task in the North, the Vietnamese people must carry out the following great tasks: First, strive to develop and transform the economy in accordance with the socialist path, vigorously promote agricultural and industrial production, and improve the people's lives; Second, vigorously promote ideological and cultural work, so that socialist ideology dominates, and improve the cultural and technical level of the working people; Third, strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate national defense, suppress current bad elements, maintain public order, and protect the peaceful labor cause of the Vietnamese people in the North; Fourth, continue to consolidate and expand the national united front on the strong foundation of the worker-peasant alliance; Fifth, vigorously promote the struggle of the entire people against US imperialism and its running dogs, and demand the restoration of normal relations between the North and the South, in order to realize the unification of the motherland; Sixth, strengthen solidarity with fraternal countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen friendly relations between the peoples of all countries, actively support the national liberation movement, and participate in the movement to defend world peace.

    Pham Van Dong said: In order to accelerate the socialist construction in North Vietnam, the basic tasks of the Three-Year Plan are: "(1) Vigorously develop agricultural and industrial production, with agriculture as the mainstay, while attaching great importance to industrial production, in order to solve the food problem, maximize the production of means of production, and pay attention to solving the problem of the production of most consumer goods. (2) Strengthen the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The main link is to develop agricultural cooperation, while actively developing and consolidating the state-owned economy. (3) On the basis of developing production, further improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people."

    Pham Van Dong said: "It is necessary to vigorously transform the individual economy and the private capitalist economy, develop and consolidate the state-owned economy, and on this basis, develop agricultural and industrial production and improve people's lives."

    Pham Van Dong finally emphasized once again: "We must rise up and actively welcome the high tide of the socialist revolution in the North. The people of the whole country must strengthen their unity and strive to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam."

    范文同说，当前越南新的革命气象的出现，主要是由于劳动人民在党的领导下发挥了革命的干劲。同时，各兄弟国家建设的成就，特别是苏联的大踏步前进和中国大跃进的辉煌胜利，也给了我们巨大的鼓舞。
