Xinhua News Agency, December 15th – This reporter reports: The 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened this September, essentially concluded its work late on December 13th. The future of the Cameroons Trust Territory in Africa remains, and a special meeting will be held in February next year to discuss it.

    A notable feature of the three months of discussions at this session was the shameful failure of the United States' attempt to drag other countries into military provocations, and widespread condemnation of the colonialist atrocities of the United States and other Western countries. In this international organization, which the United States has consistently controlled, the voting machine manipulated by the United States is becoming increasingly ineffective.

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at the opening of the session, delivered a speech to the General Assembly, clamoring to "submit the Taiwan Strait area issue to the United Nations." The United States wanted to repeat its old trick from the Korean War, manipulating the United Nations to falsely accuse China of being an "aggressor" in order to drag other allies into the water. According to U.S. newspapers, Dulles and his subordinates used various intimidation and pressure tactics behind the scenes against the representatives of allied countries for this purpose. However, despite all this, the United States could not help but quickly realize that the situation was unfavorable. Although the United States, shortly after the opening of the General Assembly, once again managed to get the Assembly to pass a proposal obstructing the resolution of the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations, even American newspaper commentators admitted that this was a "dismal victory" after the United States exerted "ugly pressure." Not only were there four fewer votes in favor of the American proposal than last year, but only Britain and Canada spoke out in support of the United States in the debate, and other those who voted in favor of the United States "noticeably remained silent." Subsequently, in the general debate of the General Assembly, many countries expressed concern about the United States playing with fire in the Far East. Dulles had to fire a blank shot and dared not mention submitting the Taiwan Strait issue to the United Nations again.

    Prior to the 13th session, the UN General Assembly's special emergency session had already resolved that the United States and Britain should withdraw their troops from the Middle East, but the United States still attempted to establish a "permanent UN police force" before the withdrawal of troops, so that it could continue its aggression against the Middle East and send troops to other regions to take the lead at any time according to the intentions of the United States. The U.S. delegation engaged in extensive behind-the-scenes activities, but most delegations directly or indirectly opposed the idea of establishing such a force. As a result, the issue was shelved by this session without even being discussed. And under the pressure of world public opinion, the U.S. and British invading forces had to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    In many discussions on colonial issues at this session, the United States and other colonial countries suffered shameful defeats.

    All of this reflects the continuing shift in the balance of power in the United Nations. Before 1955, countries participating in the U.S. military bloc accounted for two-thirds of the UN member states. After 1955, newly independent Asian and African countries continuously entered the United Nations. Currently, among the eighty-two UN member states, countries participating in the U.S. military bloc account for only slightly more than one-half, while socialist countries and countries not participating in blocs account for slightly less than one-half. It is no longer as easy for the United States to obtain a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly to pass its proposals in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter as it used to be. Moreover, the allies on whom the United States relies in the United Nations, such as the twenty Latin American countries and some other countries, are no longer so obedient to the United States' intentions in many instances.

    Although the United States still controls the United Nations, preventing this session from making its due contribution to promoting world peace and security, and has passed resolutions on issues such as Korea and Hungary that have worsened the international situation. However, the overall international trend is that the East wind prevails over the West wind. Even in this organization manipulated by the United States, even in this international institution that is far from reflecting the current true balance of international power, the United States' situation is becoming increasingly difficult.

### 本届联大反映出世界力量对比的变化  美国控制联合国越来越难

    本届联大反映出世界力量对比的变化
    美国控制联合国越来越难
    新华社15日讯  本社记者报道：今年9月开幕的联合国大会第十三届会议，已经在12月13日深夜基本结束工作。还留下非洲喀麦隆托管地前途问题，将在明年2月开会专门讨论。
    这届会议三个月的讨论里的一个显著特点是，美国企图拖其他国家一道来进行军事挑衅的阴谋遭到了可耻的失败，美国等西方国家的殖民主义暴行受到了广泛的谴责。在美国一贯控制着的这个国际组织里，美国操纵的表决机器越来越失灵了。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在会议开幕时，到大会上发表演说，叫嚷准备把台湾海峡地区问题“提交联合国”。美国想重施它侵略朝鲜战争时的故技，操纵联合国来反诬中国为“侵略者”，以便拖其他盟国下水。据美国报刊透露，杜勒斯和他手下的官员为此在幕后对盟国代表使用了种种恫吓和施加压力的手法。但是，尽管做了这一切，美国不能不很快就发现局面不妙。美国虽然在大会开幕后不久，又一次使得大会通过了阻挠解决中华人民共和国在联合国代表权问题的提案，然而连美国报纸评论员也承认，这是美国施加“丑恶的压力”后的“一次惨淡的胜利”。不仅赞成美国提案的又比去年少了四票，而且在辩论里只有英国和加拿大出来发言支持美国，其他投票支持美国者都“令人注意地保持沉默”。接着，在大会一般性辩论里，更有不少国家对美国在远东玩火表示不安。杜勒斯只好放了个空炮，以后不敢再提要把台湾海峡地区问题提交联合国了。
    在十三届会议以前，联大特别紧急会议已经决议要美英从中东撤兵，美国却仍然企图在撤兵前先成立起“联合国常设警察部队”来，这样既可继续对中东侵略，又可随时根据美国意旨派到其他地区去打头阵。美国代表团多方进行了幕后活动，但是大多数代表团都直接或间接反对建立这种部队的主张。结果是，这届会议甚至未经讨论，就把这个问题搁置起来了。而在世界舆论压力下，美英侵略军队也只好从黎巴嫩和约旦撤走。
    在这届会议不少有关殖民主义问题的讨论里，美国等殖民国家遭到了丢脸的失败。
    所有这些，反映出联合国里的力量对比在继续发生着变化。1955年前，在联合国会员国里，参加美国军事集团国家占到三分之二。1955年以后，亚非新独立国家不断进入联合国，目前联合国八十二个会员国中，参加美国军事集团的国家只占有二分之一强，社会主义国家和不参加集团的国家已占到二分之一弱。美国要按照联合国宪章规定，在大会获得三分之二多数来通过它的提案，已不像从前那么容易了。而且，美国在联合国所依恃的盟国，例如二十个拉丁美洲国家和其他一些国家，在许多场合下已不那么顺从美国的意旨了。
    虽然，美国目前还是控制着联合国，使得这届会议没有在促进世界和平和安全上作出它应有的贡献，并且在朝鲜、匈牙利等问题上通过了恶化国际局势的决议。但是，整个国际潮流是东风压倒西风，即使在美国操纵的这个组织里，即使在远远不能反映目前国际真实力量对比的这个国际机构里，美国的处境也越来越困难了。
