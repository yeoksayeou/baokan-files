Shunjiang Commune Organizes Ten Thousand People to Gather Treasures

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shunjiang People's Commune in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, has organized a "Treasure Gathering Team" of ten thousand people to collect small-scale local and special products that were previously neglected. Within five days, the entire commune collected products worth 250,000 yuan, enough to cover the commune's wage expenses for two months.

The Shunjiang Commune is located in a hilly area. In addition to abundant production of grain, sugarcane, and oil crops, it also produces medicinal materials, jute, scattered fruits, tung seeds, palm fronds, reeds, *Quercus acutissima* acorns, and more than thirty other types of small-scale local and special products. These products were previously a source of sideline income for commune members. This year, due to the focus on agricultural production, coupled with the perception of some cadres and masses that small-scale local and special products "don't yield much profit and are troublesome to collect," the harvesting work was neglected during the autumn harvest. After investigation and research, the commune's Party committee convened a meeting of cadres from various detachments and brigades, pointing out that these items, when accumulated, amount to a considerable quantity and do not require much labor, and educating cadres not to underestimate them. The meeting decided that, under the principle of not hindering major production tasks, women and semi-able-bodied laborers would be drawn to form a treasure gathering team of 18,000 people. To cooperate with the treasure gathering, the commercial departments in the market towns were also mobilized, organizing more than one hundred employees to receive and store the products from morning to night, promptly putting them into warehouses.

The work of collecting small-scale local and special products had only just begun, but it has already proven that these scattered products are not "unprofitable." The products collected in the first three days were worth 170,000 yuan, equivalent to the income from 2,000 mu of sugarcane in the entire commune.

    顺江公社万人采宝
    本报讯  四川内江县顺江人民公社组织万人“采宝队”，把过去被忽视的小宗土特产品收集起来。全社在五天内，收集的产品价值二十五万元，足够这个社两个月的工资支出。
    顺江公社地处丘陵区，除盛产粮食、甘蔗、油料外，还出产药材、黄麻、零星水果、桐子、棕片和芦苇、青杠子等三十多种小宗土特产品。这些产品过去都是社员们的副业收入来源。今年由于忙于农业生产，加上部分干部和群众认为小宗土特产品“油水不大，采摘麻烦”，因而在秋收中一度忽视了采摘工作。公社党委经过调查研究以后，召开了各支队和大队干部会议，指出这些东西积少成多，数量很可观，花的劳动力也不多，教育干部不要轻视。会议决定在不妨碍主要生产任务的原则下，抽调妇女和半劳力组成了共有一万八千人参加的采宝队。为了配合采宝，场镇商业部门也动员起来，组织了一百多个职工，从早到晚，随到随收，及时入仓。
    收集小宗土特产品的工作刚刚开始不久，就证明这些零星产品并不是“没有搞头”。头三天采集的产品就值十七万元，相当于全社两千亩甘蔗的收益。
