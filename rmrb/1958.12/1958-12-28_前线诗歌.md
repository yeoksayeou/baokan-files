Frontline Poetry

    Song of the Aerial Hunter
    Peng Xue, Air Force
	Aerial hunter drives the divine eagle, building a Great Wall in the vast sky. If enemy planes dare to invade, we will surely make them nosedive.

    Fishermen Build a Steel Wall at Sea
    Xiao Qiu
	We are maritime militiamen, with fishing nets in one hand and guns in the other. We diligently catch fish and practice martial arts, building a steel wall at sea. A round of red sun shines golden light, ten thousand boats set out to sea together. I search for both schools of fish and enemy traces, I am the king everywhere in the ocean.

    True Glory
    Xiamen Qianpu Militia Company
	Hoe in one hand, gun in the other, farmer and soldier, truly glorious; pick up the hoe to work diligently, hold the gun tightly to defend the coast.

    前线诗歌
    空中猎手之歌
    空军  彭学空中猎手驾神鹰，万里长空筑长城，如果敌机敢来犯，一定叫它倒栽葱。
    渔民海上筑钢墙
    晓丘海上民兵我们当，一手鱼网一手枪，勤抓鱼来勤练武，筑起海上钢铁墙。一轮红日闪金光，万船齐发出海洋，鱼群敌踪我都找，海洋处处我为王。
    真荣光
    厦门前埔民兵连一手锄头一手枪，是农是兵真荣光；拿起锄头勤劳动，握紧枪杆保海防。
