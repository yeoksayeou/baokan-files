Another New Development in Water Conservancy Construction
“Underwater Soil Dumping” Dam Construction Method to be Promoted Nationwide

(Our report) The Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power organized water conservancy and hydropower departments from all provinces (regions) to visit, study, and promote the experience of the Yue Lingshan Reservoir in Qin County, Shanxi Province, in constructing dams using the "underwater soil dumping" method. From mid-November to the present, visiting groups from 19 provinces (regions), including Liaoning, Jilin, Anhui, Gansu, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia, have conducted on-site visits and exchanged experiences. Everyone believes that the "underwater soil dumping" dam construction method of the Yue Lingshan Reservoir is a method of dam construction that is more, faster, better, and more economical. This major reform in water conservancy engineering construction technology provides a significant experience for the construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in various regions. Members of the visiting groups stated that after returning, they must vigorously promote this advanced experience in the winter-spring farmland water conservancy basic construction campaign.

The "underwater soil dumping" dam construction method is a Soviet construction experience. The Yue Lingshan Reservoir is the first engineering unit in China to successfully test and use this method. Under the technical guidance of the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, they have greatly improved and enriched this experience in practice, and have made new creations. This method involves dividing the dam surface into many small plots, first filling them with water to a certain depth, and then pouring the loess into the water in layers, leveling it. It utilizes the phenomenon of soil sinking after being immersed in water and the property of being compacted by applying a slight load after immersion in water. During construction, the weight of the upper layer of fill, the transportation tools, and the treading of people are used to compact the soil to meet the design requirements. In addition to inspecting the dam built with "underwater soil dumping" at the Yue Lingshan Reservoir, personnel from visiting groups from all over the country also went to the Zhangyuan Reservoir in Qin County and the Guanhe Reservoir in Wuxiang County, where this experience is being promoted, to observe the construction procedures on-site and participate in and learn specific operating techniques. After comprehensive and specific visits and studies, they summarized five major advantages of the "underwater soil dumping" dam construction method. First, in the current construction of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in various regions, rolling machinery and pumping machinery cannot meet the demand. This method does not require rolling machinery, and dam sites with conditions for water to flow by gravity do not require pumping machinery, greatly reducing the difficulty of insufficient construction equipment. Second, the dam body has greater plasticity, uniform density, and higher humidity, which can adapt to the settlement and deformation of the foundation or dam body without causing cracks. Third, the earth dam is easily and tightly connected to the loess bank and base. During the construction of irrigation, it is easy to discover hidden dangers such as caves and graves in the foundation, ensuring the safety of the dam. Fourth, this construction method is less affected by the season. It can be constructed on rainy days, and it can be applied all year round in many parts of the country. Fifth, the working surface is large and not restricted by construction conditions, which can accelerate the construction speed, save a lot of funds and labor, and reduce engineering costs. In addition, the operating technology is simple and easy for the masses to master.

This method has a wide range of applications, such as the upper dam, river embankment, and canal embankment. It can be promoted wherever there is a certain source of water, and all parts of China have the conditions for applying this method. Therefore, after this experience was shared at the National Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering Experience Exchange Conference in September this year, the conference gave it a high evaluation and proposed a suggestion for its promotion nationwide. After the personnel of the visiting groups from various provinces (regions) have specifically visited and studied, they will formulate specific experimental and promotion plans. Many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in Shanxi have promoted this experience. The promotion scale in Shanxi this winter and next spring will be faster and larger. In the Jin Southeast Prefecture alone, more than 2,000 reservoir projects are preparing to use the "underwater soil dumping" method for dam construction. (Yang Yi)

### 水利建设中又一新事  “水中倒土”筑坝法将在全国推广

    水利建设中又一新事
    “水中倒土”筑坝法将在全国推广
    本报讯  水利电力部组织全国各省（区）水利水电部门参观、学习、推广山西省沁县月岭山水库“水中倒土”筑坝的经验。自11月中旬到目前为止，已有辽宁、吉林、安徽、甘肃、江苏、广东、福建、四川和内蒙古等十九个省（区）的参观团到这里进行了现场参观并交流了经验。大家认为月岭山水库“水中倒土”筑坝法是多、快、好省的筑坝方法，这项水利工程施工技术大改革为目前各地兴建大、中型水利工程提供了一个重大经验。参观团人员表示回去以后在今冬明春农田水利基本建设运动中，一定要大力推广这一先进经验。
    “水中倒土”筑坝法是苏联的施工经验，月岭山水库是我国第一个试验成功使用这种办法的工程单位，他们在水利电力部的技术指导下，在实践过程中又大大提高和丰富了这个经验。并有新的创造。这种办法是在坝面上划成许多小地畦，先灌上一定深度的水，然后把黄土分层倒入水中，铺平。是利用土壤浸水后发生下沉现象和浸水后稍加荷重即可压实的性质，在施工时利用上层填土的重量及运土工具、人踏等作用，使土密实达到设计要求。全国各地参观团人员除验看了月岭山水库用“水中倒土”建筑的大坝，并到正在推广这种经验施工的沁县漳源水库和武乡县关河水库大坝，现场参观了施工程序，参加和学习具体操作技术。经过全面、具体参观学习，他们为“水中倒土”筑坝法总结出五大优点。一、目前各地兴建大、中型水利工程中，辗压机械、抽水机械供不应求，这种办法不需要辗压机械，有条件使水自流的坝址也不需要抽水机械，大大减少了施工机具不足的困难。二、坝体塑性较大，密度均匀，湿度较大，能适应地基或坝体的沉陷和变形，不致于发生裂缝现象。三、土坝与黄土岸和基地容易紧密衔接。在施工灌水时，容易发现地基中的穴洞、坟墓等隐患，保证坝的安全。四、这种施工方法受季节影响较小，下雨天能施工，全国很多地方可以全年应用。五、工作面较大，不受施工条件限制，可以加速施工速度，能大量地节省资金和劳力，降低工程成本，另外，操作技术简单，容易为群众掌握。
    这种办法使用范围很广，如上坝、河堤、渠堤等方面都能应用，有一定水源的地方就能推广，我国各地均有应用此种方法的条件。因此，今年9月间全国水利水电工程经验交流会议上交流了这一经验后，大会给以很高评价，并提出了在全国范围内推广的建议。这次各省（区）参观团人员具体参观、学习之后，都将制订具体试验和推广的计划。山西已有许多大、中型水利工程推广了这一经验。山西今冬明春的推广规模更快更大，仅晋东南专区就有二千多座水库工程准备采用“水中倒土”法施工筑坝。（杨义）
