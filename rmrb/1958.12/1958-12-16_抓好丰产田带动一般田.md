Grasp High-Yield Fields to Drive General Fields
Hebei Province Arranges Next Year's Production with Different Priorities
(Our Dispatch) Hebei Province is adopting the method of prioritizing high-yield fields and using them to drive general fields to arrange agricultural production for next year and prepare for even greater harvests.

According to recent information, plans for 13 million mu of large-area high-yield fields next year have been mostly implemented in communes and teams. In Chengde and Zhangjiakou Special Zones, where wheat field management tasks are minimal, plans for 2 million mu of high-yield fields have been distributed to communes and production teams. In Zhangjiakou Special Zone, 33 communes in five counties, including Zhangbei and Shangdu, have each designated a 10,000-mu, 10,000-jin high-yield square. Qinglong County in Chengde Special Zone, after planning at the county, commune, and team levels, has identified 15 high-yield ditches, 26 high-yield plains, and 24 high-yield squares, covering a total area of 200,000 mu. Professional teams, mainly composed of young militiamen, have been formed to manage fixed plots with dedicated responsibility. In Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding Special Zones, where wheat field management tasks are greater, the plan to prioritize large-area high-yield fields has also been implemented in conjunction with wheat field management work. Thus, Hebei Province's arrangements for striving for even greater harvests next year have already achieved a breakthrough in high-yield fields.

Prioritizing high-yield fields has also launched the preliminary stage of ideological mobilization for striving for even greater harvests next year. In Renqiu, Jiahe, and Mengcun Counties of Tianjin Special Zone, in conjunction with the management of large-area, high-yield wheat fields, a large-scale debate was launched on whether continued leaps forward were possible next year and whether high yields could be achieved in large areas of cultivated land. Through debate, the "condition theory" and the idea that "leaps forward have reached their limit," as well as the theory that "only small-area high yields are possible," which existed in the minds of some cadres and the masses, were broken.

Many areas have also promptly implemented various yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, manure accumulation, land preparation, and water conservancy in high-yield fields, using them to promote production preparations for striving for a good harvest next year. After Hongqi and Yuejin Communes in Guyuan County established 10,000-mu double 10,000-jin high-yield fields, they organized 3,400 laborers to plow the land, 407 laborers and 686 carts to collect and transport manure, and dozens of young adults to test well drilling, promoting various production preparation activities. After deep plowing of high-yield fields and some general fields in Weichang County, 25,000 laborers were organized to level the land and prepare ridges. According to incomplete statistics, currently over 2 million people across the province are engaged in land preparation, manure accumulation, and other field projects, and 200,000 people are drilling wells in wheat fields and large-area high-yield fields. Of the 13 million mu of high-yield fields in the province, over 5 million mu have been deep-plowed to a depth of 1.5 chi or more, and 4 million mu have been combined with deep plowing to apply 30,000 to 50,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Driven by various production preparation activities in high-yield fields, activities such as land preparation and manure accumulation in general fields have also been rapidly launched.

    抓好丰产田带动一般田
    河北省分别轻重缓急安排明年生产
    本报讯  河北省采取重点安排丰产田，利用丰产田带动一般田的方法，安排明年的农业生产和争取明年更大丰收的各项准备工作。
    根据最近了解，明年全省一千三百万亩大面积丰产田的计划已大部贯彻到社队。麦田管理任务很小的承德、张家口专区，二百万亩丰产田的规划，已下达到公社和生产队。张家口专区坝上张北、商都等五县的三十三个公社，每个社确定了一个万亩万斤丰产方。承德专区的青龙县，经过县社队层层规划，已确定了十五条丰产沟、二十六道丰产川和二十四个丰产方，面积共达二十万亩。并以青年民兵为主，组成了专业队，固定地块，专责包干管理。麦田管理任务较大的邯郸、石家庄、保定等专区，也结合着麦田管理工作，贯彻了先抓大面积丰产田的计划。这样，河北省争取明年更大丰收的安排，已先在丰产田上重点突破了。
    重点安排丰产田，又给明年更大丰收的思想动员工作，打响了前哨战。天津专区任丘、交河、孟村三县，结合着大面积高额丰产麦田的管理，对明年能不能继续跃进，大面积的耕地能否高额丰产等问题，展开了大辩论，经过辩论，打破了部分干部群众思想上的“条件论”和“跃进到头”以及“只能小面积高产”论。
    许多地区还先把丰产田的深翻、积肥、整地、水利等各项增产措施，迅速下达落实，用它推动了争取明年丰收的生产准备。沽源县红旗、跃进等三个公社搞起万亩双万斤丰产田后，曾组织起三千四百劳力翻地，四百零七名劳力、六百八十六辆大车熏肥送粪，几十名青壮年试打机井，推动了各项生产准备活动。围场县的高额丰产田和部分一般田深翻后，又组织起两万五千名劳力平地整畦。根据不完全的统计，目前全省有二百多万人进行翻地积肥和其它田间工程，二十万人在麦田和大面积丰产田里打机井。全省一千三百万亩丰产田，已有五百多万亩深翻了一尺半以上，并有四百万亩结合深翻每亩铺上了三至五万斤底肥。在丰产田各种生产准备活动的带动下，一般田的翻地积肥等活动，也迅速地开展起来。
