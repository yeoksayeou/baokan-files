Fujian Province, Haicheng County People's Committee

    Our county is the highest grain-producing county in Fujian Province. Can high-yield areas achieve a great leap forward and increase their yields by multiples or even several times? We have major differences of opinion on this issue with "skeptics," "conservatives," and those who adhere to "conditionalism" and "regionalism." However, we have triumphed, and the fact that our county achieved a bumper harvest this year answers this question. This year, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the total output of 104,231 mu of grain crops in our county increased by 194% compared to last year, nearly tripling. Isn't this a great leap forward?

    The main experiences we have learned in achieving this unprecedented bumper harvest are as follows:

    1.  Adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen political and ideological education, fully promote democracy, and continuously carry out mass-based airing of views, debates, and discussions. Guide and promote the broad masses of cadres and people to liberate their thinking, break down superstitions, and further encourage labor enthusiasm, so that their energy is constantly pushed to a new high. This is the main link in ensuring both ideological and grain harvests.

    Throughout the development of ideological education, we have paid particular attention to grasping the constant struggle between various advanced and backward ideas. Experience has proven that large-scale airing of views, debates, big-character posters, and discussions are powerful weapons for carrying out all work. When the planting density was not sufficient, when there was a shortage of fertilizer, when the fields were not dried out in time... whenever there were any difficulties, we launched mass-based airing of views, debates, big-character posters, and discussions. In this way, any problem could be easily solved. In the autumn, the county held approximately 500,000 person-times of relatively large-scale airing of views and debates, and wrote nearly 300,000 big-character posters, truly enabling the masses to speak their minds freely and fully promote democracy, thereby further resolving ideological problems and continuously improving revolutionary enthusiasm and dedication. In addition, we also used methods such as visits, inspections, and on-site meetings to educate cadres and raise the awareness of the masses with practical examples, ensuring that the entire autumn production increase movement proceeded vigorously.

    2.  Comprehensively and boldly carry out technical revolution, basically focusing on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture as a technical measure to strive for a special bumper harvest in the autumn. Among them, we particularly focused on the six major measures of early, dense, deep, fertilizer, management, and improvement. Because the leadership was determined and ideological mobilization was sufficient, the new technologies were mastered by the masses, and therefore significant results were achieved in increasing production.

    1.  Early: Farmers in our county originally had experience and habits of early planting, and the proverb "Planting after the Great Heat will not die, three clumps yield one sheng of rice" was widely circulated, but because their minds were not liberated in the past, they did not fully recognize that early planting could promote the early growth of late rice, so they were not bold enough. This year, under the light of the General Line, the county basically completed the task of rice transplanting five days after the Great Heat, seven days earlier than in the past. During the rush planting, farmers across the county, in order to race against the seasons, also organized large-scale collaborations of more than 20,000 laborers by the communes and teams. The Xincuo Production Brigade of the Hongqi Commune in Gangwei, changed its past habit of transplanting rice around the Beginning of Autumn, and completed all transplanting before the Great Heat this year, resulting in a large-area bumper harvest of 1,830 jin per mu on 430 mu of paddy fields, an increase of more than six times compared to last year.

    2.  Dense: Dense planting is an experience of increasing production for several years. This year, based on the characteristics of fertile paddy fields, deep soil layers, and convenient irrigation, the county promoted the rectangular dense planting specifications of 1×5 cun and 2×2×5 cun for single and double rows, with 8-10 seedlings planted in each clump, increasing the number of seedlings per unit area by about four times compared to last year. According to the assessment of the 921 Brigade of the Lotus Commune, with the same land and the same conditions, the yield varied greatly due to the difference in density alone: ​​the yield of 1×5 specification was 2,951 jin per mu, an increase of more than 50% compared to the 2×2×5 cun specification paddy fields, and an increase of 2.8 times compared to the 4×5 cun specification paddy fields.

    3.  Deep: In the past, farmers said, "Deep plowing of the land turns barren soil into gold," but they were not accustomed to deep plowing in the autumn. Generally, they stepped down the rice stubble after the summer harvest, and then transplanted the rice after a simple preparation. This year, in order to adapt to the needs of dense planting and non-lodging, the county completely changed the past farming habits, and all paddy fields adopted the method of deep plowing, of which 60% were plowed more than six cun deep, and 40% reached about eight cun. In order to solve the difficulties of urgent summer plowing time and insufficient耕牛, the county not only promoted the double-shared plow suitable for deep plowing, but also transformed 90% of the old plows into T-shaped deep plows, making them plow one to two cun deeper than the old-style wooden plows.

    4.  Fertilizer: In order to adapt to the characteristics of the long growing season of late rice and the need for more fertilizer, the entire autumn production has launched a combination of surprise and regular fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing competitions. The county has accumulated a total of more than 550 million dan of autumn fertilizer, which is equivalent to 2.8 billion dan of local fertilizer, with an average of 20,000 dan of fertilizer per mu (of which about 14,500 dan is base fertilizer). Before the summer planting, we launched a national half-month surprise fertilizer accumulation competition movement, with 120,000 people participating in the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement every day, accumulating a total of 250 million dan of fertilizer, ensuring the needs of late rice base fertilizer; at the same time, the masses have developed the habit of regular fertilizer accumulation, in addition to the more than 1,500 fertilizer plants shared by each commune and team, producing 780,000 jin of soil fertilizer, they also massively explored fertilizer sources according to different regions.

    5.  Management: From the beginning of soaking seeds to harvesting and entering the warehouse, we never relaxed a series of field management tasks. In mid-August, the county organized more than 5,000 cadres at all levels and 100,000 people to go to the fields to carry out the field management movement of fighting the eight passes (pest control, topdressing, seedling supplementation and thinning, weeding, drainage and irrigation, lodging prevention, alkali resistance, wind prevention, etc.) and four guarantees (guaranteeing seedlings, guaranteeing panicles, guaranteeing grains, and guaranteeing quality), forming a new situation of "people not leaving the fields, fighting in the fields," achieving the requirements of "making up for congenital deficiencies with acquired efforts" and "making up for what is lacking." In field management, we also focused on rational drainage and irrigation, timely drying of fields, prevention of lodging, and heavy application of panicle fertilizer to ensure long panicles and full grains.

    6.  Improvement: Throughout the cultivation and management of late rice, we have always implemented the improvement movement combining technology and tools. During deep plowing, we promoted 2,832 deep plowing tools; during transplanting, we promoted 1,077 direct seeding machines and direct seeders, and 8,744 transplanting boats; during inter-tillage and weeding, the county promoted more than 16,000 inter-tillage and weeding tools. Even during harvesting, we manufactured 4,300 rapid harvesting machines and improved and manufactured more than 3,800 threshing machines. In this way, in the entire labor process, semi-mechanization of operation has been gradually realized, not only improving work efficiency and solving the difficulty of labor shortage, but also further ensuring labor quality.

    3.  Go deep into the fields, strengthen leadership, and ensure the complete implementation and execution of various measures. When leading the movement to strive for a special bumper harvest in the autumn, party committees at all levels fully recognized the importance of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, grasping steel with one hand and grain with the other, and achieved mutual promotion and common leap forward. In terms of leadership methods, we constantly carried out socialist labor competitions based on agricultural activities, and vigorously promoted mass-based high-yield experimental fields to guide the continuous leap forward of overall work. Finally, although we have achieved a special bumper harvest in the great leap forward, there are also many shortcomings and problems, especially in technical measures, which have not fully kept up with the requirements of the great leap forward situation, which must be paid close attention to in the greater leap forward next year.

    高产地区更高产
    福建省海澄县人民委员会
    我县粮食生产是福建省最高的一个县。高产地区能否大跃进，产量能否成倍或数倍翻上去呢？这个问题我们与“怀疑派”、“保守派”和“条件论”、“地区论”者意见是有大分歧的。但是我们胜利了，今年我县大丰收的事实回答了这个问题。今年全县人民在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，十万零四千二百三十一亩粮食作物，总产量比去年增长194％，近两番。难道这不算是大跃进吗？
    今年所以取得空前的丰收，我们体会主要有下述几点经验：
    一、坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想教育，充分发扬民主，不断开展群众性的鸣、放、辩论，引导和促进广大干部、群众解放思想、破除迷信，进一步鼓舞劳动热情，使干劲不断推向高潮。这是保证思想、粮食两大丰收的主要环节。
    在整个思想教育的发展过程中，我们特别注意掌握各种先进和落后思想的不断斗争。经验证明：大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论是开展一切工作的有力武器。我们在插秧密度不够时，在肥料不足时，在烤田不及时时，……在有任何困难的时候，都开展群众性的大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，这样，不论什么问题都可迎刃而解。全县在秋季比较大规模的鸣、放、辩论约达五十万人次，并写了大字报近三十万张，使群众真正达到畅所欲言，充分发扬民主，从而进一步解决了思想问题，不断提高革命干劲和钻劲。此外，我们还通过参观、检查、现场会议等方式，用实际事例教育干部和提高群众认识，保证了整个秋季增产运动始终饱满进行。
    二、全面大胆进行技术革命，基本上围绕着农业八字宪法作为争取秋季特大丰收的技术措施。其中，我们特别抓住了早、密、深、肥、管、改等六大措施。由于领导决心大，思想发动充分，使新的技术为群众所掌握，因此，在增产上获得了显著的效果。
    1、早：我县农民原来就有早插的经验和习惯，普遍流传着：“大暑插不死，三丛一升米”的农谚，但由于过去思想没有解放，对于早插能促进晚稻早期生长认识不足，所以还不够大胆。今年在总路线的照耀下，全县大暑后五天就基本完成插秧任务，比过去提早七天完成。在抢插时，全县农民为了和季节赛跑，各地还以社、队组织二万多个劳力的大协作。港尾红旗公社新厝生产营由于改变过去立秋插秧的习惯，今年在大暑前就全部完成，结果获得四百三十亩山田亩产一千八百三十斤的大面积丰收，比去年增产六倍多。
    2、密：密植是几来年的增产经验。今年全县根据稻田肥沃、土层深厚、灌溉便利等特点，全县推广了1×5寸、2×2×5的单垅和双垅的长方形密植规格，每丛插8—10本，使单位面积苗数比去年增加四倍左右。根据莲花公社921大队鉴定，同等土地同样条件，只是由于密度不同，产量就有很大差别：1×5规格亩产二千九百五十一斤，比2×2×5寸的规格的秧田增产五成多，比4×5寸规格的秧田增产二点八倍。
    3、深：过去农民虽说，“田地一深耕，瘦土变黄金”，但对于秋季深耕没有习惯，一般都是夏收后踩下稻头，过过“拉达”就插秧。今年为了适应密植和不倒伏的需要，全县彻底改变了过去的耕作习惯，全部水田都采取深犁的办法，其中有60％深耕六寸以上，40％达到八寸左右。为了解决夏耕时间急促、耕牛不足的困难，全县除了推广适应深耕的双铧犁外，还把90％的旧犁，改造为丁字深耕犁，使它比旧式木犁深耕一至二寸。
    4、肥：为了适应晚稻生长期长、需要更多肥料的特点，整个秋季生产都开展着突击和经常相结合的积肥、造肥竞赛。全县共积秋肥五亿五千多万担，折为土肥二十八亿担，平均每亩肥料达二万担（其中基肥约一万四千五百担）。在夏种前我们就开展一个全民性的半个月的突击积肥竞赛运动，每天有十二万人投入积肥、造肥运动，先后共积肥二亿五千万担，保证了晚稻基肥的需要；同时群众都已养成经常积肥的习惯，除各公社、队共有肥料厂一千五百多个，先后制造土化肥七十八万斤外，还根据不同地区大量发掘肥源。
    5、管：从开始浸种一直到收割入仓，我们一点也不放松田间管理的一系列工作。8月中旬，全县组织了四级干部五千多人、群众十万人下田开展战八关（治虫、追肥、补苗间苗、除草、排灌、防倒、抗碱、防风等）和四保（保株、保穗、保粒、保质量）的田间管理运动，形成了一个“人不离田，大战田间”的新局面，做到了“先天不足，后天补上”“缺啥补啥”的要求。在田间管理上，我们还突出抓住了合理排灌，适时烤田，防止倒伏，重施穗肥，保证穗长粒饱。
    6、改：整个晚稻在耕作和管理过程中，我们始终贯彻了技术和工具相结合的改进运动。在深耕时，我们推广了深耕工具二千八百三十二部；插秧时，我们又推广直播机、直播器一千零七十七架，插秧船八千七百四十四只；中耕除草时，全县又推广了中耕除草器一万六千多支。一直到收割时，我们还制造快速收割器四千三百架，改良和制造打谷机三千八百多架。这样，在整个劳动过程中，已逐步实现操作半机械化，不但提高工作效率，解决劳力不足的困难，也进一步保证了劳动质量。
    三、深入田间，加强领导，保证各项措施完满地贯彻和执行。各级党委在领导争取秋季特大丰收运动时，都从思想上充分认识到工农业同时并举，一手抓钢铁、一手抓粮食的重要意义，并做到互相推动，共同跃进。在领导方法上，我们是根据农事活动，不断开展社会主义的劳动竞赛，大搞群众性的高额丰产试验田，来指导全面工作的不断跃进。最后，我们在大跃进中虽然取得特大的丰收，但也有不少缺点和问题，特别是在技术措施方面，还没有完全跟上大跃进形势的要求，这是明年更大跃进中必须十分注意的。
