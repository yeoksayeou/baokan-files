    Visiting Xiaoshan for Hundreds of Thousands of Mu of Jute Fields
    By our reporters Li Xinmin and Yi Xintian
    Accounting for a Quarter of the National Output
    The car left Hangzhou City, passed over the Qiantang River Bridge, and arrived at Xiaoshan County, famous throughout the country for its high and abundant jute production. The more than 200,000 mu of jute cultivated here has now been harvested. The members of the Maqu People's Commune are busy selling the jute to the state.

    The commune members talked about the scene of this year's bumper harvest, still vividly remembered. The dense jute fields, with plants taller than two or three people, were something that even the oldest people had never seen before. The girls climbed ladders to pick the jute fruit, the tops of the jute even higher than their heads. The commune members composed many songs to celebrate this year's harvest. One song sings: "Jute is taller than bamboo forests, Bumper harvest red flags are flying everywhere, We fought the drought for eighty days this year, We defeated the Old Dragon King, If you ask where the bumper harvest comes from, In the final analysis, it is the leadership of the Party."

    Xiaoshan County is located on the south bank of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province, near the mouth of Hangzhou Bay, a fertile coastal plain. This is the main jute-producing area of Zhejiang Province and also of our country. This year, the jute output of Zhejiang Province accounted for about half of the total national output, and the output of Xiaoshan County accounted for nearly 60% of the total output of Zhejiang. That is to say, about a quarter of the national jute production comes from Xiaoshan. This year, the average yield per mu of more than 205,000 mu of jute in the county was 935 jin, an increase of nearly 100% compared to last year.

    Jute, known as "luo ma" by Zhejiang farmers, is an economic crop with a wide range of uses. Jute is the main raw material for making sacks and burlap. Mixed with ramie and other materials, jute skin can also be used as raw material for making cables, ropes, hemp thread, fishing nets, etc. With the development of China's hemp textile industry, the demand for jute is also increasing. Xiaoshan's jute production is expanding its planting area and continuously increasing its yield per unit area under this situation.
    
    Flowers of Abundance Bloom Everywhere
    In 1957, the Yanfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaoshan County first created a high-yield record of "1,000 jin of jute" on 3.8 mu of land. This was the earliest "1,000 jin of jute" to appear in Zhejiang Province and also in the country. But in 1958, the area of land in Xiaoshan County that reached "1,000 jin of jute" was already 130,000 mu.

    The increase from 3.8 mu to 130,000 mu was the result of vigorously promoting high-yield experiences under the leadership of the Party and government, and mobilizing the masses to learn from and surpass the advanced.

    After the Yanfeng Agricultural Cooperative raised the high-yield banner of "1,000 jin of jute", the Xiaoshan County Party Committee and the district and township Party committees helped it summarize the high-yield experience five times, and held on-site meetings in Yanfeng several times. They also constantly organized on-site visits and held exhibitions. More than 100,000 people visited here. The high-yield experience of Yanfeng Cooperative and other high-yield jute cooperatives blossomed throughout the county.

    In the process of promoting advanced experience, there was a sharp struggle between the advanced and the conservative. There is such a story in Gualidian District: Quan Furen, the district Party secretary, and several cadres and agricultural technicians jointly created a plot of jute experimental field. Based on the experience of the Yanfeng Agricultural Cooperative's small farm planting on April 30 last year, they sowed the seeds in mid-April. Due to several days of rain, cold weather, and soil hardening, the seedlings did not emerge. Some commune members turned to the old almanac and said, "How can production seasons leap forward?" Later, some people even wrote big-character posters to oppose early sowing. Quan Furen and others believed that early sowing was good. After the first failure, they immediately sowed a second time and improved the sowing method. As a result, the seedlings emerged and grew very well. This year, the jute sowing period in the county was nearly a month earlier than in previous years, and the planting density generally reached more than 32,000 plants per mu, an increase of about 2,000 plants compared to previous years.

    When the jute was three chi tall, the county party committee, based on last year's high-yield experience, proposed: break the rules, apply fertilizer early, apply more fertilizer, and apply heavy fertilizer, requiring 800 to 1,000 dan of fertilizer to be applied per mu. As a result, a mass movement to accumulate and create fertilizer was launched in full swing, and an average of 1,360 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu of jute field in the county.

    This year, after mass field visits and comparisons in Xiaoshan County, everyone summarized the high-yield experience of jute as: break the rules and sow early, overcome nature and protect the seedlings, the soil and fertilizer nourish the jute and make it full, cultivation and management are firmly grasped, the plants are uniformly thick and dense, and the roots are all under the leadership of the Party.
    
    Jute Cultivation Does Not Stop After Harvesting
    After the commune members in the jute area overcame the drought, some cadres and masses developed a "settled" mentality, began to relax, and relaxed the cultivation work during the favorable period after the rain. With the spirit of continuous revolution, the Xiaoshan County Party Committee convened a county-wide cotton and hemp over-planning movement conference, criticized the "settled" mentality of some people who were waiting to reap the benefits, and put forward the resounding slogan of "making the jute grow three chi taller." A late-stage cultivation movement centered on a shock of fertilization and pest control was launched throughout the county. The county party committee immediately organized 5,000 cadres to go to the fields, eating in the fields, working in the fields, and sleeping in the fields, establishing field headquarters; at the same time, they led the vast number of commune members to establish large numbers of high-yield fields and carry out a large-scale high-yield movement.

    Mao Fuyuan, a cadre of the Hongqi People's Commune, proposed a method of removing jute flowers and fruits during the over-planning movement to promote the continued growth of jute. After the commune members experimented on a small amount of land, the jute that had undergone "flower and fruit picking" generally grew about three cun per day, about twice as fast as the jute that was not picked. This experience was immediately promoted to all the jute fields in the commune. Subsequently, about 130,000 mu of jute in the county also adopted this experience.

    During the late-stage jute cultivation movement in Xiaoshan County, districts, townships, and teams all created opposing sides and launched friendly competitions with each other. They also helped each other in the competition in order to improve together. In the pest control work, Gualidian District sent 100 people with 100 sprayers to Yipeng District, its opposing side, for support, working for three consecutive days.
    
    Higher Yields, Even Higher Yields
    While summarizing this year's unprecedented bumper harvest, the Xiaoshan County Party Committee also discovered the huge potential for further increasing the yield per unit area. This year, the highest yield per mu was more than 4,000 jin, while the lowest was only about 400 jin, a vast difference. In order to meet the needs of the mass industrialization movement for jute raw materials, the Xiaoshan County Party Committee has put forward the requirement to strive for a greater leap forward next year, which is to make the low-yield areas quickly catch up with the high-yield areas, and the high-yield areas achieve even higher yields.

    麻林万顷访萧山
    本报记者  李新民  伊心恬
    占全国产量的四分之一
    汽车出了杭州市，驶过钱塘江大桥，就到了以黄麻高产、多产闻名全国的萧山县。这里栽培的二十万多亩黄麻，现在已经收割完了。麻区人民公社的社员们正忙着把黄麻卖给国家。
    社员们谈论起今年的丰收情景，犹念念不忘。一片片两三人高的麻林长得又密又粗，哪怕年纪再老的人过去也从来没有见过。姑娘们爬上梯子摘麻果，麻顶还要高过头。社员们编了许多歌曲，欢唱今年的丰收。有首歌唱的是：“黄麻要比竹林高，丰产红旗到处飘，今年抗旱八十天，我们斗倒老龙王，要问丰收哪里来，归根到底党领导。”
    萧山县在浙江省钱塘江南岸，靠近杭州湾口，是一片土质肥沃的滨海平原。这里，是浙江省也是我国黄麻主要产地。今年浙江省黄麻产量占全国总产量一半左右，而萧山县的产量又占浙江全省近60％。这就是说，全国黄麻有四分之一左右产在萧山。今年全县二十万五千多亩黄麻平均亩产九百三十五斤，比去年增产近一倍。
    黄麻，浙江农民素称络麻，是用途很广的经济作物。黄麻是制造麻袋、麻布的主要原料。麻皮和苎麻等混合，还可用作制造电缆、绳索、麻线、渔网等原料。随着我国麻纺工业的发展，对黄麻的需要量也就越来越多。萧山黄麻生产就是在这种形势下，不断扩大种植面积，不断提高单位产量的。
    丰产之花遍地开
    1957年，萧山县岩峰农业社有三亩八分地首先创造了“千斤麻”高产纪录。这是浙江省也是全国最早出现的“千斤麻”。可是1958年，萧山县达到“千斤麻”的土地已经有十三万亩了。
    从三亩八分到十三万亩，是在党政领导下，大力推广丰产经验，发动群众学先进、超先进的结果。
    当岩峰农业社出现了“千斤麻”的丰产旗帜后，中共萧山县委和区、乡党委就先后五次帮助它总结了丰产经验，并几次在岩峰召开现场会，还不断组织现场参观和举办展览会，先后到这里参观的共有十万多人。岩峰社和其它黄麻丰产社的丰产经验，在全县普遍开了花。
    在推广先进经验的过程中，贯穿着先进和保守的尖锐的斗争。瓜沥区有这样的故事：区委书记全福仁和几个干部、农业技术员合搞一丘黄麻试验田，根据岩峰农业社小农场去年4月30日播种的经验，提早在4月中旬就把种子播下，由于一连几天阴雨，天气寒冷，土地板结，苗出不来。有的社员就翻老皇历说：“生产季节怎么能跃进呀？”后来还有人为此写大字报反对早播。全福仁等却相信早播好，第一次失败了，马上又第二次播下去，并改进了播种方法。结果苗出土了，一直生长很好。今年全县黄麻播种期比往年提早将近一月；密植程度普遍达到每亩三万二千株以上，比往年增加了二千株左右。
    麻高三尺的时候，县委根据去年丰产经验，提出：破常规，早施肥，多施肥，重施肥，要求每亩施肥八百担到一千担。于是，群众性的积肥造肥运动搞得热火朝天，全县平均每亩麻田施肥一千三百六十担。
    萧山县今年通过群众性的田间参观评比后，大家总结了黄麻丰产经验是：打破常规播得早，战胜自然保全苗，土肥壅麻吃得饱，培育管理抓得牢，齐头粗密株又高，根源全是党领导。
    黄麻不收培育不停
    麻区社员战胜干旱后，部分干部群众产生了“定局”思想，开始松劲，放松了雨后有利时机的培育工作。中共萧山县委以不断革命的精神，召开了全县棉麻超规划运动大会，批判某些人的坐等收剥的定局思想，提出“要黄麻再长三尺高”的响亮口号。随着全县开展起一个以突击施肥和防治病虫害为中心的后期培育运动。县委并马上组织五千个干部到田头去，吃在田间，工作在田间，睡在田间，成立田头指挥部；同时，带动广大社员把丰产畈大批地建立起来，开展大面积高产运动。
    红旗人民公社干部毛福元在超规划运动中，提出摘去黄麻花果，促使黄麻继续生长的办法。经社员们在少量土地上试验，一般经过“采花摘果”的麻每天长出三寸左右，比不摘的加速生长一倍左右。这个经验马上就推广到全公社的黄麻田。接着，全县有十三万亩左右的黄麻也采用了这一经验。
    萧山县在后期培育黄麻运动中，区区、乡乡、队队都搞对立面，相互展开友谊竞赛。他们在竞赛中又互相帮助，以便共同提高。瓜沥区在治虫工作中，就派了一百个人带着一百只喷雾器到自己的对立面义蓬区去进行支援，一连工作了三天。
    高产再高产
    萧山县委最近在总结今年史无前例的大丰收的同时，也发现了进一步提高单位面积产量的巨大潜力。今年，单产最高的是四千多斤，而最低的只四百斤左右，相差很远。为了满足全民大办工业对黄麻原料的需要，萧山县委已经提出了争取明年更大跃进的要求，这就是要做到低产的迅速赶上高产，高产的更高产。
