    A Pair of Ebony Chopsticks
    Datong Coal Mine, Liu Jiancheng

    While the kitchen staff at the canteen were washing chopsticks, they discovered a pair of black chopsticks with silver tips, and upon closer inspection, they were made of ebony. She was a bit surprised and quickly asked her companion, "Look, how did a pair of ebony chopsticks end up in a box of bamboo chopsticks?" As everyone gathered around to look, someone quickly said, "I know what happened." It turned out like this:

    Yesterday, female commune member Sun Guifeng's mother came from Sunjia Village, ten miles away, to see her little grandson, Mao Mao. Naturally, lunch was eaten in the people's commune's canteen. Guifeng first took two pairs of chopsticks at the entrance of the canteen, putting one pair in her mother's pocket and holding the other herself as she hurried to get food. Li Ersao, who was serving the food, saw that there was a guest and quickly helped Mao Mao and his grandmother to a seat, placed a pair of chopsticks down, and brought over the guest meal. By the time Guifeng arrived, Mao Mao was already eating with his little fork and his grandmother.

    After the meal, Mao Mao rummaged through his grandmother's pocket, found a pair of bamboo chopsticks, and started whittling them with a small knife. Guifeng shouted, "Mao Mao, Mao Mao! Why are you playing with the chopsticks?" while asking the child for them, accidentally breaking the chopsticks. Seeing her daughter asking for the chopsticks, the grandmother said, "Why do you need his? It's just a pair of chopsticks, if he breaks them, we can buy another pair..."

    "Do you know? These belong to the commune."

    "Really? How did a pair of chopsticks end up in my pocket? Oh! This old fool, after eating the canteen's food, I even wanted to take the canteen's chopsticks." The more the grandmother thought about it, the more she felt it was wrong, and then she saw that Mao Mao had even broken them. This matter formed a knot in the grandmother's heart.

    The next morning, Mao Mao's second uncle came to the township for a meeting and brought a pair of chopsticks and a message, the grandmother said: "Don't make things difficult for the child, it was me who damaged the commune's things, so return these chopsticks to the canteen."

    一双乌木筷子
    大同煤矿  刘建成
    食堂炊事员在刷洗筷子的时候，发现一双黑色的银头筷子，仔细一瞅，还是乌木的。她有点奇怪，连忙问她身边的同伴：“你看，怎么在一盒竹筷子中间出来了一双乌木的？”大伙儿正围拢来看，里边有一个人连忙说：“我知道。”原来是这么回事：
    昨天，女社员孙桂凤的妈妈从十里路外的孙家寨来看小外甥毛毛。午饭自然是在人民公社的食堂吃了。桂凤进食堂门先抽了两双筷子，一双塞在妈妈的口袋里，另一双自己拿着忙的去端饭了。卖饭的李二嫂见有客人来，忙扶毛毛和姥姥坐好，放下一双筷子，端来了客饭。等桂凤走来，毛毛已经用自己的小叉子和姥姥吃饭了。
    吃过饭以后，毛毛翻腾姥姥的口袋，找出一双竹筷子，就用小刀子削着玩了。桂凤一边喊：“毛毛，毛毛！你怎么玩起筷子来了？”一边问孩子要，不留心把筷子弄断了。姥姥看见女儿要筷子，却说：“要他的干啥，一双筷子，玩坏了再买……”
    “您知道吗？这是公社的东西。”
    “真的，我口袋里怎会装了一双筷子？噢！我这个老糊涂，吃了食堂的饭，还要带食堂的筷子。”姥姥越想越不应该，再一看，毛毛还给劈断了。这件事在姥姥的心里就结了个疙瘩。
    第二天早晨，毛毛的二舅来乡里开会，顺便给捎来了一双筷子和一个口信，姥姥说：“不要难为孩子，是我损坏了公社的东西，就把这双筷子偿还食堂吧。”
