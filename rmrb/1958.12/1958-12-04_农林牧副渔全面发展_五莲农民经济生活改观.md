	Comprehensive Development of Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Sideline Occupations, and Fishery
	Wulian Farmers' Economic Life Transformed
	(Our Report) Wulian County, Shandong Province, has changed its old habit of walking on one leg and is vigorously developing diverse economic production while focusing on agricultural production. The county's experience tells people that only by comprehensively grasping production can we develop production at a faster pace and meet the people's growing needs in all aspects.
	Wulian County's diverse economic production is mostly concentrated in five areas: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fish farming. Over the past year, the county has achieved good results by launching mass movements. In forestry, by first focusing on the cultivation of economic forests, the silkworm cocoon production situation this year is unprecedentedly good, with a total output of more than 2.41 million jin, an increase of nearly two and a half times compared to last year; this year's fruit income totaled 370,000 yuan, an increase of more than two and a half times compared to last year. Animal husbandry, including cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs, although the number of animals raised has not increased much compared to last year due to repeated support to other areas, income has also increased by 134% compared to last year. Fishery did not exist in this county at all last year, but this year it has seen great development, and all reservoirs in the county have basically achieved having fish in every reservoir. If we add the income from beekeeping, medicinal materials, and sideline occupations such as chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits, this year's total income from diverse economic production in the county reached 34.62 million yuan (accounting for 34% of total agricultural income), an average of 86.8 yuan per person, an increase of two times compared to last year.
	This year, the county's total grain output reached 1,882 million jin, an increase of nine times compared to last year. Combining agricultural income and diverse economic production income, the county's total income this year reached 188.25 million yuan, an average of more than 456 yuan per person.
	The development of diverse economic production has resulted in the emergence of more than ten "mores" in the county: more grain, more money, more silkworm cocoons, more mining exploitation, more meat, eggs, and fruits, more native product processing, more people wearing new clothes and shoes, more people building new houses, more livestock, and more materials to support national construction. The emergence of these ten "mores" has greatly improved people's living conditions. While living such happy lives, people often look back at the past. Previously, the saying "Golden Qingdao, Silver Jinan, neither gold nor silver is Weixian, to death, not in Wulian County" was widely circulated here. Now, people are singing mountain songs like "People living in the mountains are happy, heroes build their homes."
	Most of Wulian County is mountainous, and material resources are exceptionally abundant. However, in the past, the great significance of comprehensively and extensively developing diverse economic production was not deeply understood, and leadership energy was mostly focused on grasping agriculture. Therefore, mountain resources were not developed in a timely manner, and the improvement of production and living standards was not significant. This raises the question: Can production be developed at a high speed by only focusing on agriculture? Can it meet the people's large and diverse needs? Last winter, the Wulian County Party Committee became aware of this issue, changed the practice of walking on one leg, and began to grasp diverse economic production, thereby achieving this year's results.

### 农林牧副渔全面发展  五莲农民经济生活改观

    农林牧副渔全面发展
    五莲农民经济生活改观
    本报讯  山东省五莲县改变一条腿走路的老习惯，在大抓农业生产的同时，大抓多种经济生产。这个县的经验告诉人们，只有全面抓生产，才能以更快的速度发展生产，满足人民日益增长的各方面的需要。
    五莲县多种经济生产多集中于农业、林业、牧业、副业、养鱼等五个方面。一年来，这个县以大搞群众运动的方法，创造了良好成绩。在林业上，由于首先抓住了对经济林的培育，今年蚕茧生产情况空前良好，总产量达二百四十一万多斤，较去年增产近两倍半；今年果品收入总值为三十七万元，比去年增收两倍半多。包括牛、马、羊、猪等在内的畜牧业，由于对外地一再支援，现在的存养量虽然比去年增长不大，但收入也比去年增收134％。渔业去年在这个县一点也没有，而今年来了个大发展，全县所有水库已基本达到了库库有鱼。如果再加上养蜂、药材和鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等副业收入，今年全县多种经济生产收入总值达三千四百六十二万元（占农业总收入34％），每人平均八十六元八角，比去年增加两倍。
    今年这个县的粮食总产量达十八亿八千二百多万斤，比去年增产九倍。农业收入和多种经济生产收入加在一起，今年全县共收入一亿八千二百五十多万元，每人平均四百五十六元多。
    多种经济生产的发展，使全县出现了十多：粮食多，钱多，蚕茧多，矿藏开采的多，肉、蛋品、果品多，土产加工多，穿新衣、新鞋的多，盖新房的多，牲畜多，支援国家建设的物资多。这十多的出现，大大改善了人们的生活状况。人们在过这样幸福日子中，经常望着现在回顾过去。以前这里到处流传着“金青岛，银济南，不金不银是潍县，至死不在五莲县”的歌谣。现在人们又都唱起了“居山人心快，群英建家园”的山歌。
    五莲县大部是山区，物质资源异常丰富。但过去对全面地、大量地发展多种经济生产的重大意义认识不深，领导精力多集中于抓农业，因而山区资源没有得到及时开发，生产和生活水平的提高不显著。这就给人们提出了这样一个问题：只抓农业是否能够高速度的发展生产，是否能够满足人民大量的多方面的需要？去年冬季，中共五莲县委觉察到这个问题，改变了一条腿走路的作法，开始抓多种经济生产，从而取得了今年的成绩。
