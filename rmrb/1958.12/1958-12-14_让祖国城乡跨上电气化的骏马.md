The Source of Power

December in Harbin brings piercing winds and biting cold. Yet, in these frigid days, the workers of the Harbin Boiler Factory, Turbine Factory, and Electrical Machinery Factory are engaged in a fiery high-production month competition. The cold is dispelled by the intense fervor of labor. In those towering factory buildings, a moving scene unfolds. Huge banners proclaiming "Fully tap potential, vigorously support the whole country" stretch across the workshops. The workers, laboring intensely, skillfully and swiftly assemble the various components, large and small, that have just been processed into boilers, turbines, generators, and electric motors. Trains rumble into the factory buildings. Overhead cranes, having just unloaded materials from various regions from the carriages, load the various packaged power generation equipment back into the carriages. The trains then roar out of the workshops, heading to all parts of the motherland.

These three power machinery manufacturing plants were built successively during the First Five-Year Plan. Their scale is grand and magnificent, boasting world-class equipment. The Electrical Machinery Factory, the first to be built, has been producing while under construction for several years, manufacturing large hydro-turbine generator sets that China had never made before, equipping dozens of hydroelectric stations such as Guanting and Shizitan. Before this year's National Day, the Electrical Machinery Factory, together with the newly built Boiler Factory and Turbine Factory, jointly produced China's first complete set of high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power equipment. From then on, these three factories, hailed as the "Three Sisters," constituted China's first modern power generation equipment manufacturing base. This base is a powerful source of power for our country. It will continuously send complete sets of large-scale hydro and thermal power equipment to all parts of the country, allowing the cities and villages of the motherland to mount the steed of electrification and gallop towards socialism.

A Banner of High Production

After the Party Central Committee issued the call to fight for steel in September this year, central leading comrades such as Deng Xiaoping personally came to inspect these three factories, bringing tremendous encouragement and strength to the workers of the three factories. In order to support the country in seizing 10.7 million tons of steel, the workers threw themselves into a vigorous mass movement. Party committee secretaries and factory directors personally went to the front lines, and the enthusiasm of the workers soared. The potential of the equipment was fully exploited, and high-production "satellites" rose into the sky one after another. At the Electrical Machinery Factory, everyone is talking about the story of the casting workshop launching a "satellite."

In the smoke-filled casting workshop, the electric furnace spits out boiling steel, splattering steel flowers everywhere, illuminating the entire workshop and reddening the smiles of the workers. When the last ladle of steel was lifted away, a worker laughed and said, "This furnace has produced another nine tons of steel!"

This electric furnace that produced nine tons of steel was originally a small three-ton electric furnace. Since September, this factory has undertaken a large number of orders for the whole country, the output of motors has risen sharply, and various steel castings for motors have also increased several times. Steel castings are the first hurdle, and failure to complete them on time would affect the delivery of motors. Faced with this heavy task, people discussed it animatedly. Some advocated that increasing the task required increasing the equipment; however, the leader of the steelmaking team, Communist Party member Sun Xuexi, resolutely opposed this view. He said, "What kind of increased production is it if we have to increase equipment?" He had been dealing with this electric furnace for several years, had figured out its temperament, and knew that it still had potential. So he expressed to the Party organization his determination to tap its potential, guarantee the supply of castings, and make contributions to supporting the whole country.

At this time, the steelmaking experience of "boiling pig heads in a teapot" came from Shenyang. Sun Xuexi was so happy that he almost jumped up. He and his partners immediately learned this experience. Before the residual heat of the furnace had dissipated, he took the lead in crawling into the furnace to enlarge the hearth. When the electric furnace roared again, Sun Xuexi, standing next to the furnace and operating it, worked tirelessly, braving temperatures of over four hundred degrees. He didn't even bother to wipe the sweat from his face; when his pants were burned by the spurting flames, he quickly dipped his legs in the water trough and continued to work with the furnace rake. The first experiment was successful, and the three-ton electric furnace suddenly produced nine tons of molten steel. However, they were not satisfied with these achievements. On this basis, they advanced victoriously, adopted advanced experiences such as the rapid furnace loading method, and melted twelve furnaces at most every day. Ladle after ladle of molten steel turned into steel castings and were delivered to the brother workshops ahead of schedule, ensuring that the motors were delivered on time. From then on, a banner of high production was established next to the steelmaking furnace.

Reform Outdated Rules and Regulations

The mass movement sweeping through the three major factories, like a surging torrent, inspired the daring and hardworking workers, riding this torrent, to break through the shackles of unreasonable rules and regulations, and constantly innovate production technology with their wisdom and experience, pushing production to a new high tide.

In the boiler factory's forging workshop, where steam hammers thundered, veteran forger Wang Zhaoshan operated long iron tongs, clamping a red-hot steel ingot from the furnace, and with several young workers, lifted it onto the die-forging machine, forging it continuously. In just two minutes, the steel ingot was forged into a valve body part. The workers happily said, "This new method is really good. If we had changed it earlier, production efficiency would have improved long ago."

This new forging method was conceived by Wang Zhaoshan a long time ago. Originally, processing this type of valve body part, according to the process regulations, required three steps: rolling, bending, and final forging. Wang Zhaoshan had a lot of opinions about these process regulations. He pondered for many days and came up with a new method: performing final forging directly after rolling, eliminating the intermediate step. The results of the experiment showed that production efficiency could be increased by half. Everyone shouted happily, "This is great! We don't have to jump around forging anymore."

Just as the workers were clapping their hands and cheering, the process technician came over. Wang Zhaoshan and the others greeted him with smiles. Liu Deli抢着 (Liu Deli rushed to) said to the process technician, "You've come just in time. Master Wang just changed the process, and the effect is really great. We were just about to ask you to approve it." As he spoke, he started the die-forging machine, and Wang Zhaoshan demonstrated the process. The process technician frowned and watched for a moment, quickly raising his hand to stop Wang Zhaoshan from starting the machine, and asked Wang Zhaoshan what theoretical basis there was for doing this. This sudden questioning made Wang Zhaoshan a little nervous. He said, "I don't have a word of theory to talk about, but I have a practical basis. Doing it this way can be more, faster, better, and more economical." The process technician put on a stern face and said, "Process regulations are the law. The processing methods currently used are all extracted from the world's advanced experience. Whoever changes them randomly is destroying the process law." Wang Zhaoshan was so angry that the veins on his forehead bulged when he heard this, and he couldn't say a word. He went to the workshop leader, who also criticized him for not randomly changing the process regulations, and even forced him to make a self-criticism. So, they had to continue to work according to the old regulations, tired all day, but only producing more than a hundred pieces.

In this mass movement, Wang Zhaoshan boldly adopted the new method. Coincidentally, the process technician came over again. The workers thought he was going to interfere again, but unexpectedly, he warmly shook Wang Zhaoshan's hand and said, "My superstitious mind has only now been liberated." The workers used the new method to forge valve body parts, producing more than two hundred pieces a day, launching a high-yield "satellite."

Marching Towards Cutting-Edge Technology

The torrent of the mass movement flowed from the workshops to the offices. The technical personnel who joined the movement drew courage and strength from it and boldly began to march towards cutting-edge technology. In just two months, miracles came one after another. New technologies that were despaired of yesterday were completely mastered by them today.

In the design of steam turbine generators, a group of young technical personnel led by Fu Cenhui, in order to support national construction, boldly advocated adopting the latest hydrogen internal cooling technology. After the currently produced 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator is converted to hydrogen internal cooling, it can generate 50,000 kilowatts of electricity. This new technology is a new initiative in the motor industry. In scientifically advanced countries, it has only recently begun to be adopted. Precisely because of this, when Fu Cenhui proposed this idea, many old engineers who had studied abroad discouraged him, saying, "We lack experience and technical data. It's a bit risky to build hydrogen-cooled generators right away. Let's take it step by step."

However, Fu Cenhui and his partners, who were caught up in the torrent of the movement, did not heed the obstruction of these old engineers. They remembered the Party's teachings: Large factories and new factories must do big things and new things. We must do things that others cannot do, and we can exceed the goals of others. So, filled with courage and strength, they automatically formed a hydrogen-cooled assault combat team and began a fierce attack on this cutting-edge technology. During the design process, they often worked late into the night in front of the drawings and always took the drawings down to the workshop to study with experienced workers. Many structural problems were solved one by one. This 50,000-kilowatt hydrogen-cooled turbine generator, which was originally scheduled to be made next year, is now being rushed to be made by technical personnel and workers together. They guarantee that it will be completed at the end of this month as a gift for the New Year's Day of 1959.

The successful design of this cutting-edge technological product encouraged people's confidence in conquering cutting-edge technology. Now, a 200,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment using completely new technology and a complete set of 210,000-kilowatt Liujiaxia Hydropower Station units have been successfully designed one after another, and 600,000-kilowatt power generation equipment has entered the tense design stage.

Boiling High-Production Month

In December, the workers of these three factories, in order to realize this year's leap forward plan and welcome a greater leap forward next year, launched a high-production month competition in the mass movement. In this month, they will complete 400,000 kilowatts of thermal and hydro power equipment. This month's output exceeds the total of the first six months of this year, truly a remarkable high-production month! Now the workers of the three factories are soaring with enthusiasm, production targets are rising sharply, and high-production "satellites" are spinning in the sky one after another. A worker-singer wrote a hymn for the high-production month:

The glory of the industrial constitution shines,
The mass movement is at a high tide,
The three power dragons stir up huge waves,
High-production satellites soar to the ninth heaven.

    让祖国城乡跨上电气化的骏马
    甘甫明  白福源
    动力的源泉
    12月的哈尔滨，朔风凛冽，寒气逼人，就在这寒冷的日子里，哈尔滨锅炉厂、汽轮机厂和电机厂的职工们，热火朝天地展开了高产月竞赛，寒冷也被炽烈的劳动热情驱散了。在那些巍峨高大的厂房里，弥漫着一片动人的景象，“充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国”的巨幅标语横贯车间、紧张劳动着的工人们，把刚刚加工出来的大大小小的部件，熟练敏捷地组装成锅炉、汽轮机、发电机和电动机。火车隆隆地驶进厂房，凌空运行的大吊车，刚从车厢里卸下来自各地的材料，又把包装成箱的各种发电设备装满车厢，火车旋即吼叫着驶出车间，奔向祖国各地。
    这三个动力机械制造厂，是在第一个五年计划期间先后兴建的。它们的规模雄伟宏大，拥有世界第一流的设备。最先动工建设的电机厂，几年来一边建设一边生产，制成了我国从未制造过的大型水轮发电机组，装备了官厅、狮子滩等数十个水电站。今年国庆节前夕，电机厂又和新建成的锅炉厂、汽轮机厂一起，配套制成了我国第一套高温高压火力发电设备。从此，这三个被誉为“三姊妹”的工厂，构成了我国第一个现代化的发电设备制造基地。这个基地是我国强大的动力源泉，它将把成套的大型水力和火力发电设备，源源不断地送往各地，让祖国的城市和乡村跨上电气化的骏马，向社会主义疾驰飞奔。
    一面高产红旗
    今年9月，党中央发出为钢而战的号召后，邓小平等中央领导同志亲莅这三个工厂视察，给三厂职工带来了巨大的鼓舞和力量。为了支援全国夺下一○七○万吨钢，职工们投入了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，党委书记和厂长亲临前线，工人群众干劲冲天，设备潜力被充分发挥出来了，高产“卫星”接二连三地升上天空。在电机厂人人都传颂着铸工车间放“卫星”的故事。
    在烟雾缭绕的铸工车间里，电炉倾吐着沸腾的钢水，四处迸溅着钢花，照亮了整个车间，也映红了工人们的笑脸。当最后一包钢水被吊走时，一个工人欢笑着说：“这炉又炼出了九吨钢！”
    这台炼出九吨钢的电炉，原来是一台三吨的小电炉。从9月以来，这个厂又为全国承制了大批订货，电机的产量直线上升，各种电机的铸钢件，也成倍地增长。铸钢件是第一道关，不能按时完成就要影响电机出厂。在这繁重的任务面前，人们议论纷纷，有人主张增加任务就得增加设备；可是，炼钢组长、共产党员孙学习坚决反对这种主张，他说：“要增加设备还算什么增产呢？”他和这台电炉打了好几年交道，已经摸透它的脾气，知道它还有潜力，于是他就向党组织表示，决心挖掘潜力，保证铸件供应，为支援全国立功。
    这时，从沈阳传来了“茶壶煮猪头”的炼钢经验，孙学习高兴的几乎跳了起来，他和他的伙伴们马上就学起这个经验，炉膛的余热还未散尽，他就带头钻进炉膛里，扩大了炉膛。当电炉又吼叫起来的时候，站在炉旁操作的孙学习，冒着四百多度的高温，不顾一切地劳动着。满脸汗水，他也顾不得擦；裤子被喷出的火舌烧着了，他就迅速把腿伸到水槽里一蘸，又操起炉钎继续干。第一次试验就获得了成功，三吨电炉一下子炼出了九吨钢水。但是，他们并没有满足这些成绩，在这个基础上，又乘胜前进，采用了快速装炉法等先进经验，最高每天熔炼十二炉，一炉炉的钢水，变成了铸钢件，提前送到了兄弟车间，保证了电机按时出厂。从此，一面高产红旗，就在炼钢炉旁落户了。
    改革陈规陋矩
    席卷三大厂的群众运动，像一股汹涌澎湃的巨流，敢想敢干的工人们，乘着这股巨流，冲破了不合理的规章制度的束缚，用自己的智慧和经验，不断革新生产技术，把生产推向新的高潮。
    在汽锤轰鸣的锅炉厂锻工车间里，老锻工王兆山操着长长的铁钳，从炉膛里夹出一块通红的钢锭，和几个年轻工人抬到模锻机上，翻转不停地锻造着，仅仅两分钟的时间，钢锭就被锻成阀体零件了。工人们喜悦地说：“还是这个新的办法好，要是早改过来，生产效率早就提高了。”
    这个新的锻造方法，是王兆山很早以前就想出来的。原来加工这种阀体零件，按照工艺规程的规定，要经过滚压、压弯、终锻三道工序。王兆山对这个工艺规程很有意见，他琢磨了很多天，想出了个新办法，滚压后直接进行终锻，省去中间一道工序，试验的结果，生产效率可以提高一半，大家都高兴的叫嚷着：“这可太好了，再也不用东一蹦西一跳的锻造了。”
    正当工人们拍手叫好的时候，工艺员走了过来，王兆山他们笑呵呵地迎了上去，刘德礼抢着对工艺员说：“你来得正好，刚才王师傅改动了工艺，效果真大呀，正想找你批准呢。”说着他就开动了模锻机，由王兆山表演了一番。工艺员皱着眉头看了片刻，赶快扬起手制止王兆山开动机器，问王兆山这样干有什么理论根据。这突如其来的质问，使得王兆山有些紧张，他说：“要谈理论我一句没有，可是我有实际根据，这样干就能多快好省。”工艺员扳起面孔说：“工艺规程就是法律，现在采用的加工方法，都是从世界先进经验中提炼出来的，谁乱改谁就是破坏工艺法律。”王兆山听了这番话，气的额上青筋突起，一句话也说不出来了。他去找车间领导，领导上也批评他不该乱改工艺规程，还逼着他作了检讨。就这样，他们只得又按照老规程干了，一天累得很，可是只出一百多个活。
    在这次群众运动中，王兆山大胆采用了新办法，恰好工艺员又走了过来，工人们以为他又要来干涉，但是出人意料之外，他竟热情地握着王兆山的手说：“我这个迷信的脑瓜，现在才解放。”工人们用新办法锻造阀体零件，一天就干了二百多个，放出了高产“卫星”。
    向尖端技术进军
    群众运动的洪流，从车间漫向科室，投身于运动中的技术人员们，从中吸取了勇气和力量，大胆地开始向尖端技术进军了。在短短的两个月里，奇迹一个接着一个，昨天还慨叹莫及的新技术，今天就被他们完全掌握了。
    在汽轮发电机的设计中，以傅岑辉为首的一批青年技术人员，为了支援国家建设，大胆主张采用最新的氢气内部冷却技术，现在生产的二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，改用氢气内部冷却之后，就可以发出五万瓩的电力。这种新技术，是电机工业上的一项新创举，在科学发达的国家，也是最近才开始采用的。正由于这样，当傅岑辉提出这个主张时，许多留过外洋的老工程师，就气馁地说：“我们既缺乏经验，又缺少技术资料，马上就搞氢冷发电机，有点冒险，还是一步步慢慢来吧。”
    可是，卷入运动洪流中的傅岑辉和他的伙伴们，并没有理睬这些老工程师的阻拦，他们记住了党的教导：大厂、新厂要办大事、办新事，别人做不到的事情我们要做到，别人的目标我们可以超过。于是，他们浑身都是勇气和力量，自动组成了氢冷突击战斗小组，开始向这一尖端技术发起猛攻。在设计过程中，他们常常在图案前忙到深夜，并随时带着图纸下车间，找有经验的工人研究，许多结构上的难题，都一一迎刃而解了。这台原定在明年才能制成的五万瓩氢冷汽轮发电机，现在正由技术人员和工人一起加紧赶制中。他们保证在这个月末完成，向1959年元旦献礼。
    这一尖端技术产品设计成功，鼓舞了人们攻取尖端技术的信心。现在，采用全新技术的二十万瓩火力发电设备，二十一万瓩的刘家峡水电站全套机组，已相继设计成功，六十万瓩的发电设备也进入紧张设计阶段。
    沸腾的高产月
    12月，这三个工厂的职工们，为了实现今年的跃进计划，迎接明年更大的跃进，在群众运动中又掀起了高产月竞赛。在这个月份里，他们将完成四十万瓩火力、水力发电设备。这一个月产量就超过了今年头六个月的总和，真可称为惊人的高产月啊！现在三个工厂的职工干劲冲天，生产指标直线上升，高产“卫星”一个接着一个在天空飞旋，有一位工人歌手为高产月写下了一首赞歌：
    工业宪法光芒照，
    群众运动热潮高，
    动力三龙翻巨浪，
    高产卫星冲九霄。（附图片）
