Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Bingwen photographed the construction of a steel joint base in Boshan, Henan Province, at the foot of the Taihang Mountains. Henan is building steel base points, adjusting labor organization, and arranging employee life. Shanxi Liugou Steel Plant is conscientiously rectifying ideology, organization, and production management.

According to Henan Daily news, all parts of Henan Province are actively rectifying, consolidating, and improving the "small-scale indigenous steel furnaces," reorganizing the 250,000 iron smelting furnaces and 130,000 steel smelting furnaces into more than 20,000 furnace groups, establishing 1,567 steel plants, and determining 266 steel base points.

In the mass movement to develop the steel industry, Henan Province established many "small-scale indigenous steel furnaces" and combined indigenous and foreign steel plants in just a few months. After rectification, the steel production in various parts of the province has shifted from scattered to centralized, and from shock campaigns to normal operations. However, due to incomplete organization, unfixed personnel, poor production planning, and the lack of well-established technical management systems, steel production in various regions is not very balanced, and product quality is not stable enough. In order to further improve the "small-scale indigenous steel furnaces," Henan Province is carrying out rectification work with the implementation of "five fixings" (fixed location, fixed type, fixed group, fixed personnel, fixed leadership) and "twoizations" (steel baseization, production factoryization) as the content, and with the improvement of steel quality and output as the center.

In the process of consolidating and improving the "small-scale indigenous steel furnaces," political and ideological work was strengthened first, overcoming the temporary views of some workers and establishing the idea of "taking the factory as home" and engaging in steel production for the long term. Secondly, based on the reserves of iron ore and coal mines, as well as transportation and water resources, large and small steel base points were determined and steel plants were established. According to the power equipment situation, the iron smelting furnaces and steel smelting furnaces were organized into furnace groups. Various localities have also continuously rectified the steel workforce. The number of fixed steel workers in the province is about three million, and various specialized teams have been formed according to the type of work, further specializing the labor organization.

With the preliminary realization of factoryization and the formation of base points, various localities have correspondingly strengthened leadership and established some management systems. According to statistics from five regions, including Luoyang, Xuchang, Nanyang, Xinyang, and Zhengzhou, more than 3,300 deputy factory directors and deputy party committee secretaries have been appointed; functional departments such as sections (shares) and offices have been set up, and basic production organizations such as workshops and work sections have been established; preliminary production plans, responsibility systems, brief technical operation essentials, and production and consumption quotas and evaluation and reward systems have been formulated.

Various localities have universally paid attention to the lives of employees. For example, the housing problem of employees has been solved by building new dormitories, adjusting civilian houses, and opening up cave dwellings. The canteen work of various steel plants has also been gradually improved, so that the steel army can eat enough, eat well, and eat hot food. Other service industries, such as daily necessities stores, sewing factories, barber groups, and bathhouses, have also been established successively, and some have also established medical institutions. The production, rest, study, and entertainment time of the steel army has also been appropriately arranged, generally ensuring eight hours of sleep and a certain amount of rest, study, and entertainment time.

Now, steel production in various localities is becoming more and more normal, and steel production and quality are gradually improving. The steel army of the province is widely carrying out technical revolution, striving to achieve "good iron, good steel, steel should become materials, and materials should be diverse."

This newspaper reports that the Liugou Steel Plant in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, combines "five fixings" (fixed location, fixed type, fixed group, fixed personnel, fixed leadership) with "four rectifications" (rectifying ideology, organization, production and financial management, and relations between cadres and the masses), "taking socialist and communist education as the guiding principle," and launching a mass movement to rectify the factory. This movement quickly overcame the chaos in factory management, improved steel production and quality, and initially realized factory enterpriseization, democratic management, and normalized production, laying the foundation for a greater leap forward in steel production and basic construction next year.

The Liugou Steel Plant was established in the mass steelmaking movement this year. Most of its members were originally farmers. In the past few months, they have built more than 100 various iron smelting furnaces, produced more than 100 tons of indigenous steel, and more than 1,500 tons of pig iron. However, due to everyone's lack of experience, there were some problems in organizational work, ideological work, production and financial management. There was a chaotic phenomenon of "cadres flying all over the place, workers rotating throughout the factory, public property unattended, and financial expenditures in chaos." Some cadres had crude work styles, some workers were not at ease in their work, and production was not normal enough.

In order to solve these problems, the factory party committee, taking socialist and communist education as the guiding principle and improving steel production and quality as the center, launched a mass movement of "everyone making suggestions, everyone expressing opinions, everything discussing democracy, and the whole factory undergoing major rectification." Within two days, 15,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the factory, raising nearly 20,000 opinions. Based on the opinions of the masses, thematic debates and special rectifications were carried out in four aspects: ideology, organization, production and financial management, and the relationship between workers and cadres, combined with the implementation of "five fixings."

In terms of ideological rectification, the factory party committee found that there were two reasons why some workers were not at ease in their work: one was that workers were not educated enough, and some workers did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of steel production; the other was that the workers' living problems were not well resolved. In response to this situation, in addition to conducting positive education and publicizing the factory's long-term plan, debates were also carried out based on the universally existing ideological problems, thereby enhancing the masses' awareness and inspiring everyone's determination and enthusiasm to build a steel plant. At the same time, the lives, studies, and recreational activities of employees were further arranged. In terms of eating, democratic management of canteens, diversification of food, and mechanization of kitchen utensils were implemented. Everyone sleeps on a warm kang. The factory also established nurseries for female workers with children. Red and expert night schools were established in each workshop. The factory organized ten basketball teams and an amateur theater troupe. In this way, the workers felt that the factory was more lovely.

In the "five fixings" work, the base was fixed, the basic construction tasks were determined, the various furnaces were rectified, and 30 groups were formed with two furnaces in each group, and each group was equipped with power and blowers.

In terms of fixing personnel, through organizational rectification, according to the needs of each workshop and the technical expertise of the workers, more than 2,500 workers were arranged to work in iron smelting, mining, metal processing, coking, basic construction, ore crushing, and transportation. This facilitates leadership and overcomes the phenomenon of idle labor and waste. After the personnel were fixed, the attendance rate increased from 85% to 99.6%. Within half a month, more than 250 all-rounders, 82 mining experts, 58 iron smelting experts, 50 clever girls, and 21 "know-it-all" cadres emerged.

In terms of fixing leadership and improving the organization, through rectification, institutions such as the factory department, the production planning section, and the basic construction section were established. In order to enable cadres to go deep into key areas, create experience, and strengthen leadership, 85% of the cadres were fixed in the workshops, eating, living, and laboring with the workers; 15% of the cadres implemented half-day work and half-day labor. This further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.

Appropriate regulations have also been made in terms of financial management, employee wage standards, and living welfare benefits.

After these rectifications, the plant's iron production increased from the original maximum daily output of 20 tons to 45 tons, and the quality was guaranteed. In order to prepare for a greater leap forward next year, the factory mobilized the masses to build twelve factories, including refractory brick factories, cement factories, brick factories, lime factories, coke factories, saltpeter factories, and machinery manufacturing factories; thirty kilometers of earthen railways are also under construction.

    巩固提高钢铁小土群
    工作必须愈作愈细致
    河南省博爱县正在太行山麓的柏山建设一个钢铁联合基地  新华社记者  杨丙文摄河南建设钢铁基点，调整劳动组织，安排职工生活山西柳沟钢铁厂认真整顿思想、组织和生产管理
    据河南日报消息  河南省各地积极整顿、巩固和提高钢铁“小土群”，把二十五万座炼铁炉和十三万座炼钢炉，整编为炉组二万多个，建立钢铁厂一千五百六十七个，确定钢铁基点二百六十六个。
    在全民大办钢铁工业的运动中，河南省在短短的几个月中建立了许多钢铁“小土群”和土洋结合的钢铁厂。随后经过整顿，全省各地的钢铁生产已由分散到集中、由突击转向正常。但是由于机构不健全、人员不固定、生产计划性差和技术管理制度还没有很好地建立起来，各地钢铁生产不很均衡，产品质量也不够稳定。为了进一步提高钢铁“小土群”，河南各地以实行“五定”（定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导）、“两化”（钢铁基地化、生产工厂化）为内容，以提高钢铁的质量和产量为中心，进行整顿工作。
    在巩固提高钢铁“小土群”的过程中，首先加强了政治思想工作，克服了部分职工的临时观点，使他们树立了“以厂为家”长期办钢铁的思想。其次，根据铁矿煤矿的储藏量和交通、水力资源等条件，确定大小钢铁基点和建立钢铁厂，并根据动力设备情况，把炼铁炉、炼钢炉编成了炉组。各地对钢铁队伍也不断进行了整顿。全省固定下来的钢铁工人约有三百万左右，并且根据工种编成了各种专业队伍，使劳动组织进一步专业化。
    随着工厂化的初步实现和基点的形成，各地都相应地加强了领导和建立一些管理制度。据洛阳、许昌、南阳、信阳、郑州五个地区的统计，共配备了正副厂长和正副党委书记三千三百多人；设置了科（股）室职能部门，建立了车间、工段等生产基层组织；初步制定了生产计划、责任制度、简要的技术操作要点以及生产、消耗定额、评比奖励制度等。
    各地普遍地注意了职工的生活。如用新建宿舍、调整民房、开辟窑洞等办法，解决了职工的住房问题。各钢铁厂的食堂工作也逐步改进，做到使钢铁大军吃饱、吃好、吃热。其他服务性行业如日用品销售店、缝纫厂、理发组、浴池等也都相继建立起来，有的还建立了医疗机构。钢铁大军的生产、休息、学习、娱乐等时间也都作了适当安排，一般都保证了八小时的睡眠和一定的休息、学习、娱乐时间。
    现在，各地钢铁生产日趋正常，钢铁产量和质量逐步提高。全省钢铁大军正广泛开展技术革命，力争作到“铁是好铁，钢是好钢，钢要成材，材要多种”。
    本报讯  山西省武乡县柳沟钢铁厂，把“五定”（定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导）和“四整顿”（整顿思想、组织、生产财务管理和干群关系）结合起来，“以社会主义、共产主义教育为纲，掀起了一个群众性的整顿工厂运动。这个运动迅速克服了工厂管理工作上的混乱现象，提高了钢铁产量和质量，并且初步实现了工厂企业化、管理民主化、生产正常化，为明年钢铁生产和基本建设更大跃进打下了基础。
    柳沟钢铁厂是在今年全民办钢铁运动中建立的。成员绝大部分原来是农民。几个月来，他们建起了各种炼铁炉一百多座，炼出土钢一百多吨，生铁一千五百多吨。但是由于大家缺乏经验，在组织工作、思想工作、生产和财务管理方面，都存在一些问题。一度曾经出现了“干部满天飞，工人全厂转，公物无人管，财务开支乱”的混乱现象，有的干部作风粗暴，部分工人不安心工作，生产不够正常。
    为了解决这些问题，厂党委以社会主义、共产主义教育为纲，以提高钢铁产量和质量为中心，发动群众开展了一个“人人提意见，个个发议论，事事讲民主，全厂大整顿”的群众性的运动。两天内，全厂就贴出大字报一万五千张，提出近两万条意见。根据群众意见，集中地在思想、组织、生产财务管理和工人与干部关系等四个方面，开展了专题辩论和专题整顿，结合推行了“五定”。
    在思想整顿方面，厂党委发现有些工人不安心工作的原因有两个：一是对工人教育不够，部分工人对生产钢铁的意义认识不足；一是对工人生活问题解决得不好。针对这种情况，除从正面进行教育，并宣传工厂的远景规划以外，还根据普遍存在的思想问题开展了辩论，从而提高了群众的觉悟，鼓起了大家建设钢铁厂的决心和干劲。同时进一步安排了职工的生活、学习和文娱活动。在吃饭方面，实行了食堂管理民主化，饭菜多样化，灶具土机械化。人人都睡上了热炕。厂里还为有孩子的女工成立了托儿所。各车间成立了红专夜校。厂里组织了十个篮球队，一个业余剧团。这样，使工人们都感到工厂更加可爱。
    在“五定”工作中，固定了基地，确定了基本建设任务，把各种炉子进行了整顿，按两炉一小组，组成三十个小组，每组配备了动力和鼓风机。
    在定员方面，通过组织整顿，根据各车间的需要和工人的技术特长，将二千五百多个工人分别安排在炼铁、采矿、金属加工、炼焦、基本建设、碎矿、运输等几个工种。这样，既便于领导，又克服了窝工浪费现象。人员固定以后，出勤率由85％提高到99.6％。半月内涌现出二百五十个多面手、八十二个采矿能手、五十八个炼铁能手、五十个巧姑娘和二十一个“百事通”干部。
    在固定领导、健全机构方面，通过整顿，建立了厂部、生产计划科、基本建设科等机构。为了使干部深入重点，创造经验，加强领导，把85％的干部都固定到车间，和工人同吃同住同劳动；15％的干部实行了半天工作半天劳动。这也进一步密切了干部和群众的关系。
    在财务管理、职工工资标准和生活福利待遇等方面，也作了适当的规定。
    经过这些整顿，全厂铁的产量由原来最高日产二十吨提高到四十五吨，并且保证了质量。为了给明年更大跃进作准备，这个厂发动群众新建了耐火砖厂、水泥厂、青砖厂、石灰厂、焦炭厂、硝磺厂、机械制造厂等十二座工厂；三十公里的土铁路也在紧张施工。
