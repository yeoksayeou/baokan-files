Wisdom Blooms on the Water Conservancy Front
Shandong Fully Launches Technological Revolution

(This newspaper dispatch) Shandong Province, on the farmland water conservancy front, has mobilized the broad masses to launch a vigorous technological revolution movement, increasing water conservancy construction efficiency by an average of more than two times compared to last year. Last year, ten million people worked for eight months to complete 13 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. This year, from the beginning of December, thanks to the vigorous technological revolution, three million people working hard for one month have already completed 2.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. Moreover, many advanced areas have achieved a daily work efficiency of 50 to over 100 cubic meters in water conservancy construction. The province's water conservancy construction movement has initially formed a high tide. 56,696 machine-operated wells have been dug, and 6.6 billion cubic meters of water have been stored using pits, ponds, reservoirs, and rivers. Twenty-seven counties have achieved machine-operated well coverage, and various water conservancy projects have successively commenced construction. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee requires that, on the basis of having basically alleviated common drought and flood disasters, drought and flood disasters must be completely eliminated. Within the next two years, the entire province must reach the standard of no disasters from heavy rain and guaranteed bumper harvests without rain, allowing agricultural production to enter a new era that is fully guaranteed and assured. This arduous water conservancy construction task is being completed under conditions of exceptionally tight industrial and agricultural production and a lack of labor. This can only be achieved by vigorously carrying out a mass-based technological revolution movement, and by working diligently and cleverly in many ways. From the very beginning of this winter's large-scale water conservancy effort, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee grasped this key issue from multiple angles.

First, there was a vigorous effort to reform tools and adopt semi-mechanized construction tools. Currently, the province has produced and promoted more than 100 types of advanced construction tools, totaling over 7 million pieces, including more than 121,000 wooden dump carts, more than 15,500 aerial soil conveyors, more than 34,500 sets of tamping tools, more than 350,000 digging tools, more than 6.9 million soil transport carts, and more than 150,000 water lifting devices. The majority of water lifting devices are being converted to wind power, and some areas have built simple wooden, bamboo, stone, and iron tracks. The large-scale emergence of these advanced tools has greatly saved labor and increased work efficiency. On the Caibei construction site in Zhanhua County and the Menglianggu construction site in Mengyin County, a set of tamping tools consisting of a sheep's horn roller, a prism roller, and a flat roller can replace the physical labor of 80 to 120 people, increasing work efficiency by 13 to 20 times. Jining created a rolling shutter-type soil conveyor, operated by two people cranking and eight people loading, adjustable in length, and capable of digging underwater, greatly solving the difficulties of underwater construction in winter.

Large-scale production of earthen explosives and the use of earthen explosives for blasting to open mountains and dig soil is a new initiative in Shandong Province for solving excavation projects. This method of excavating with earthen explosives has spread throughout the province. Earthen explosives have great power. On the Dongping Lake construction site, using just over 18 kilograms of explosives, 30,000 cubic meters of soil were blasted at once. After blasting a fifth-grade river channel, it can meet standards with only minor repairs. On the Jining Canal project, medicine was loaded into bamboo tubes and placed underwater in pre-drilled holes to blast underwater. The masses said, "With a bang from the earthen cannon, the river is instantly formed. One loud bang is equivalent to the work of hundreds of laborers." Penglai County recently created an even simpler and more economical method of making medicine.

Relying on the masses, self-reliance, making do with what is available, and establishing various factories on water conservancy construction sites on a large scale are measures taken by the province to accelerate water conservancy construction and solve resource shortages. These factories obtain materials locally, produce locally, and use locally, while also testing, using, and improving simultaneously. They also widely convert water conservancy into power, playing a significant role in solving power and resource shortages. These two methods have also greatly promoted the tool reform movement and the movement to open mountains and dig soil using earthen medicine, while also accelerating the pace of communal industrialization. According to incomplete statistics from only the Changwei, Zibo, and Yantai special districts, 381 various factories have been established on construction sites. In these construction sites, many places have also mastered the method of building and utilizing simultaneously, converting water into power, and then promoting the development of water conservancy movements and other productions. Xiawei Township in Yishui County created a model in this regard. The township uses its completed reservoir to generate electricity using water differentials, powering mills to supply the entire township with flour, freeing up a large number of people to do other work.

    水利战线上盛开智慧花
    山东全面开展技术革命
    本报讯  山东省在农田水利战线上，发动广大群众，展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动，使水利建设工效比去年平均提高两倍以上。去年一千万人，干了八个月，才完成土、石方工程一百三十亿公方。今年各个水利工地，从12月开始，由于大搞技术革命的结果，三百万人大干一个月，已经完成了土、石方工程二十一亿公方，其中还有许多先进地区在兴修水利中，日工效达到了五十公方到一百多公方。现在全省水利建设运动，已初步形成高潮，机井已打成五万六千六百九十六眼，利用坑塘水库、河道已蓄水六十六亿公方，二十七个县已经机井化，各种水利工程，已经陆续开工。山东省委要求在已经基本解除普通水旱灾害的基础上，要彻底消灭水旱灾害，在今明两年内，全省达到大雨不成灾、无雨保丰收的标准，使农业生产开始进入一个完全有保障有把握的新时代。这样繁重的水利建设任务，还是在工农业生产异常紧张和劳力缺乏的情况下来完成，就只有大搞群众性的技术革命运动，从多方面苦干加巧干才能实现，山东省委从今冬一开始大搞水利，就从多方面抓住了这个关键性的问题。
    首先是大搞工具改革，采用半机械化的施工工具，现在全省已经制成和推广各种先进施工工具一百多种，七百多万件，其中各种木斗车十二万一千多部，空中运土器一万五千五百多部，夯压工具三万四千五百多套，挖土工具三十五万多件，运土车六百九十多万辆，提水工具十五万多部。大部提水工具正在改装风力带动，有些地区并建成木、竹、石、铁制的简易路轨。这些先进工具的大量出现，大大节省了劳力，提高了工效。沾化县的菜北工地和蒙阴县的孟良崮工地，用羊角碾、棱子滚、平面碾三件组成一套夯压工具，可抵八十至一百二十人的体力劳动，提高工效十三倍到二十倍。济宁创造了一种卷帘式运土器，两人摇绞关、八个人装，可长可短，能挖水下方，大大解决了冬季下水施工的困难。
    大造土炸药，用土药爆破的办法开山挖土，是山东省解决挖方工程的新创举。这种土药爆破挖方的办法已经传遍全省，土药爆破威力很大，东平湖工地，用十八公斤多炸药，一下轰起三万公方土，五级河道爆破之后略加修整即能合乎标准。济宁运河工程，用竹桶装药，顺着事先打好的眼，安到水下，可炸水下方，群众说“土炮一声响，煞时变成河，轰然一声，顶几百个劳力干的。”蓬莱县最近又创造了一种更简便更节省的制药方法。
    依靠群众，自力更生，因陋就简，在水利工地上大量兴办各种工厂，是这个省加速水利建设解决资源不足采取的措施。这些工厂，就地取材、就地生产、就地使用，边试边用边改进，并且广泛地把水利变成动力，对解决动力和资源不足起了很大作用。这两种办法，还大大促进了工具改革运动和大施土药开山挖土的运动，同时也加快了公社工业化的速度。仅据昌潍、淄博、烟台三个专区的不完全统计，在工地上已建立各种工厂三百八十一处。在这些工地上，很多地方还掌握了边建设、边利用、把水变成动力，再推动水利运动及其他生产的发展，沂水县夏蔚乡在这方面创造了范例，这个乡利用修好的水库，制造水差发电，带动碾磨，供全乡吃面，腾出大批人力来干其他活。
