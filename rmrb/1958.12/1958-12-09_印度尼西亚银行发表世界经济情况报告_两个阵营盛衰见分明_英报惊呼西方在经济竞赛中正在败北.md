Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta—The Bank of Indonesia recently published its "1957-1958 Report," stating that economic activity in the United States and Western Europe did not maintain the levels of 1954 to 1956, "but entered an economic recession. There are currently no signs that the economic recession is ending."

The report, after presenting many facts and statistics, said, "Undeniably: American industry has entered its third economic recession since World War II." It cited figures showing that prices in the United States continue to rise while wages continue to fall. The number of unemployed workers has also increased.

The report pointed out, "There are two external factors endangering underdeveloped countries like Indonesia, namely: the decline in raw material prices in recent years and the developing economic recession in Western Europe and the United States. These factors will inevitably further weaken Indonesia's export markets." The report said, "These two facts have and will continue to affect Indonesia's economic development."

The economic situation of socialist countries described in the report stands in stark contrast to that of the United States and Western Europe. It said, "The economic development of Eastern European countries in 1957 once again demonstrated the progress these countries have made in all aspects." The report also cited percentages of industrial output growth and personal income increases in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

The report pointed out the significant progress made by the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in agriculture, especially in grain production, and noted that these countries are paying more attention to the production of consumer goods.

When discussing China's economic development, the report pointed out that prices in China have been relatively stable over the past five years. China successfully completed its first Five-Year Plan in 1957. During the first Five-Year Plan, China's industrial development was rapid, and at the same time, grain production increased, and progress was made in transportation and communications.

The report also cited figures illustrating the development of industry and agriculture in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

In an article published in the Jakarta "People's Daily," Indonesian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Nyoto commented on the report, saying that although he could not agree with some of the opinions in the report, and that a considerable portion of the figures in the report were outdated, it could still be seen from the report that the capitalist system is decadent, while the socialist system is superior. Capitalism is like the setting sun, while socialism is like the rising sun.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th—London Dispatch: The British conservative "People" newspaper published an article on the 7th, fearfully saying: "The West is rapidly losing the economic war with communism."

Although the author of the article expressed deep hatred and made shameless slanders against the Chinese people's enthusiasm and achievements in building socialism, he had to admit that the Chinese people had made astonishing achievements in construction.

The author wrote helplessly: "Adding to what we know about the great achievements being made in Russia, you will feel that half of the communist world is mocking our industrial progress."

    印度尼西亚银行发表世界经济情况报告
    两个阵营盛衰见分明
    英报惊呼西方在经济竞赛中正在败北
    据新华社雅加达讯  印度尼西亚银行最近发表的“1957—1958年报告”说，这一年，美国和西欧的经济活动没有保持1954年至1956年的水平，“而转入经济衰退。目前还看不到经济衰退结束的迹象”。
    这份报告在举出许多事实和统计数字以后说，“无可否认：美国实业界已经进入第二次世界大战以来的第三次经济衰退。”它列举数字表明：美国物价不断上涨而工资不断下降。失业工人的数目也有增加。
    报告指出，“有两个外部因素危及像印度尼西亚这样的不发达国家，那就是：最近几年原料价格下跌以及西欧和美国的正在发展中的经济衰退。这些因素将不可避免地进一步削弱印度尼西亚的出口市场。”报告说，“这两项事实已经并且将要继续影响印度尼西亚的经济发展。”
    这份报告叙述的社会主义国家的经济情况同美国和西欧的经济情况形成了鲜明的对比。它说，“东欧国家在1957年的经济发展情况又一次显示了这些国家在各方面的进步”。报告还援引了苏联和东欧国家工业产值增长和个人收入提高的百分比。
    报告指出了苏联和东欧国家在农业特别是在粮食生产方面所取得的巨大进展，它指出这些国家对消费品生产给予了更大的注意。
    在谈到中国经济发展的情况时，报告指出，近五年来中国物价相当稳定。中国已经在1957年胜利地完成了第一个五年计划。在第一个五年计划期间，中国的工业发展是很快的，同时，粮食的产量有了增加，在运输和交通方面也取得了进展。
    报告还援引数字说明越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国工农业的发展。
    印度尼西亚共产党副总书记约多在雅加达“人民日报”上发表的文章中评论这份报告说，虽然他不能同意这份报告中的某些意见，而且报告中的相当一部分数字是过时的，但是从这份报告中也可以看出，资本主义制度是腐朽的，而社会主义制度是优越的。资本主义像夕阳西下，而社会主义像旭日东升。
    新华社8日讯  伦敦消息：英国保守的“人民报”7日发表的一篇文章惶恐地说：“西方正在同共产主义进行的经济战中迅速地败北。”
    文章的作者尽管对中国人民建设社会主义的热情和成就表现了深深的仇恨并进行无耻的污蔑，但是他也不得不承认，中国人民在建设中已经取得惊人的成就。
    作者无可奈何地写道：“加上我们所知道的在俄国正在取得的巨大成就，你们将会感到，占世界一半的共产党世界正在嘲笑着我们的工业进展。”
