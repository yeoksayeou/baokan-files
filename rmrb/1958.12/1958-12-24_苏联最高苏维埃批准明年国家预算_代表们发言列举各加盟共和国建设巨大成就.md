After discussing the report made yesterday by Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev, the meeting approved the 1959 Soviet national budget and passed the National Budget Law.

Today's meeting began the second item on the agenda – on strengthening the connection between primary and secondary schools and life, and on further developing the national education system. Ivan Kairov, President of the Russian Federation Academy of Educational Sciences, made a report on the reform of secondary education; Zelenko, Director of the Central Labor Reserve Administration of the Soviet Council of Ministers, made a report on vocational and technical education.

The total revenue of the 1959 Soviet national budget approved at the meeting is 723,369,159,000 rubles, and the total expenditure is 707,637,887,000 rubles, with revenue exceeding expenditure by nearly 16 billion rubles.

On the 22nd and 23rd, the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held separate meetings to discuss Zverev's report on the 1959 budget and the implementation of the 1957 budget, which he delivered at the joint session of the two houses on the morning of the 22nd.

He said that the per capita production of pig iron, iron ore, coal, animal oil, and sugar in Ukraine now exceeds that of the United States, and milk production is almost equal to that of the United States.

Aristanbekov emphasized that investment in capital construction of the national economy of the Kazakh Republic this year has increased by 1.8 times compared with 1953. The grain sold and sold to the state by the republic's collective farms and state farms this year is almost eight times more than in the bumper years before the reclamation of wasteland. The representative of the Azerbaijan Republic, Islamic Imam Mustafayev, said that if Azerbaijan relied on imports for all important industrial products it needed before the October Revolution, then now the republic exports more than 120 kinds of Azerbaijani industrial products to many countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

In his speech, Belarusian representative Avkhimovich spoke in detail about the significance of the measures taken by the Party and the government in agriculture after 1953 for the agricultural development of the Belarusian Republic.
