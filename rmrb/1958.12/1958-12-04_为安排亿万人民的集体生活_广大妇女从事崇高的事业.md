For Arranging the Collective Life of Hundreds of Millions of People
Broad Masses of Women Engage in a Noble Cause

(Our report) The people's commune movement has brought about the unprecedented development of social collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries. This is one of the largest industries in our society today, and women are an active and major force in this new undertaking.

From the very beginning of the commune movement, large numbers of women have left their families and participated in collective labor in public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, sewing factories, and rural hospitals. In their labor, women have demonstrated their initiative and overcome many difficulties, making these things happen quickly, well, and economically. In Shaanxi Province, 450,000 women are working as cooks, nursery workers, and midwives; in Hongqi People's Commune in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, the cooks of the Jin Gou Production Team are enthusiastic in serving the members. The five of them handle the meals for 289 people. Although the workload is heavy, they still come up with various ways to make 22 kinds of exquisite food to improve life. These five female cooks strongly emphasize the significance of their labor. They say: If the meals are not well prepared, everyone's enthusiasm for production will not be high, and socialism cannot be built soon. In the Satellite People's Commune of Tunliu Town, Shanxi Province, there is a "versatile daughter-in-law" praised by everyone. This "versatile daughter-in-law" painstakingly researched and created five machines such as a foot-operated blower, a vegetable cutter, and a noodle press.

Because women have exerted their wisdom and strength in collective welfare undertakings, they have effectively supported the production of the masses. For example, during the busy farming season, many places have implemented the "nursery to the fields" method, which greatly facilitates the masses' participation in production. In Wuqing County, Hebei Province, the attendance rate increased from 70% to more than 90% because of this. The Zhaogezhuang station of the Zhangzhen People's Commune in Shunyi District, Beijing, runs a clothing factory. During the autumn harvest, the women in this factory worked hard for a month and solved the problem of clothing for the commune members in a timely manner. Some commune members with many children could not get enough cotton clothes until the coldest days of winter in the past, but this year they were prepared with cotton clothes before the weather turned cold.

The widespread establishment of public welfare undertakings has also freed housewives from the burdens of housework, and they have enthusiastically participated in agriculture, industry, and other construction undertakings. According to labor department estimates, the total number of new female laborers emerging this year is about 50 million or more. On the agricultural front, female laborers generally account for about 50% of the total labor force. The ranks of female workers have greatly expanded. According to statistics in September this year, the number of female workers nationwide has increased by more than 45% compared with last year.

In order to do these undertakings well, Party organizations in various places have strengthened their leadership. Kunming City recently specially transferred a group of young and outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to take on childcare work. Some districts in Beijing have opened training classes for nursery workers to improve their ideological level and childcare knowledge, and require them to work hard to cultivate the noble cause of successors to communism.

The broad masses of women are engaged in respectable work in these "ordinary" jobs. The people love them, and large numbers of outstanding people have been elected by the masses as models and activists in socialist construction. In Shaanxi Province, a total of more than 21,000 model cooks, nursery workers, feeders, and midwives have been selected from townships, counties, and provinces. According to statistics from four special districts in Shanxi Province, 790,000 women are working in public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and maternity hospitals, of which more than 324,000 have been elected as models and activists. Among these outstanding people, many are skilled chefs and excellent cooks. Cai Zhenmei, an excellent cook and nursery worker in Jinping County, Yunnan Province, is a capable Tu ethnic woman who cares about collective life. During the busy farming season of steelmaking and autumn harvesting and planting, she and an old woman in her fifties were responsible for the meals of more than 100 people. At the same time, she also led thirteen children, making large-pot meals and soft rice and porridge for patients and children. Once, she saw that eleven Miao commune members in a neighboring village had difficulties with their canteen work, which delayed production, so she mobilized the Miao commune members to eat in her own canteen. There are thousands upon thousands of such outstanding people across the country. Their work is ordinary, but it is truly great.

    为安排亿万人民的集体生活
    广大妇女从事崇高的事业
    本报讯  人民公社化运动带来了公共食堂和托儿所等社会集体福利事业的空前发展，这是今天我国社会上一项最大的行业之一，在这项新的事业中，妇女群众是一支积极的、主要的力量。
    从公社化运动一开始，各地就有大批妇女走出家庭，参加了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫厂和农村医院等集体劳动。在劳动当中，妇女们发挥了积极性，克服了很多困难，使这些事情办得又多又快又好又省。陕西省有四十五万妇女担任炊事员、保育员和接生员的工作；浙江省东阳县红旗人民公社金钩生产队的食堂炊事员热心为社员服务，她们共五个人办理二百八十九人的伙食，工作负担虽然较重，可是仍然想出各种办法，做出了二十二种精致的饭食来改善生活。这五位女炊事员十分强调她们劳动的意义，她们说：伙食搞不好，大家生产劲头不高，社会主义就不能早日建成。山西省屯留镇卫星人民公社有个人人称赞的“万能媳妇”，这位“万能媳妇”苦心钻研创造出脚踏吹风机、切菜机、压面机等五种机器。
    由于妇女们在集体福利事业中发挥了智慧和力量，因而有力地支援了群众的生产。例如在农忙季节，许多地方实行了“托儿所到田”的办法，大大地便利了群众参加生产。河北省武清县由于这样做了，全县出勤率由70％增加到90％以上。北京市顺义区张镇人民公社赵各庄站办了一个被服厂，这个厂的妇女们在秋收的时候苦战一月，及时解决了社员们的穿衣问题，有些家里孩子多的社员，过去总到三九天才能穿齐棉衣，今年天不冷棉衣就备齐了。
    普遍举办公共福利事业，还使家庭妇女从家务牵累中解放出来，踊跃地参加了农业、工业以及其他各种建设事业。据劳动部门估算，今年各地新涌现出来的妇女劳动力，总数约达五千万人以上。在农业战线上，妇女劳动力一般都占了劳动力总数的50％左右。女职工的队伍大大扩大，今年9月份统计，全国女职工比去年增加了45％以上。
    为了把这些事业办好，各地党的组织都加强了领导。昆明市最近专门抽调了一批年轻优秀的共产党员和共青团员去担任保育工作。北京市有的区为保育员开办了训练班，提高了保育员的思想水平和保育知识，要求她们努力做好培育共产主义接班人的崇高工作。
    广大妇女群众在这些“平凡”的工作岗位上，从事着令人尊敬的工作，人民群众爱戴她们，大批的优秀人物被群众选为模范和社会主义建设积极分子。陕西省由乡、县、省选出的模范炊事员、保育员、饲养员和接生员共有二万一千多人。山西省根据四个专区统计，有七十九万妇女在公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和妇产院工作，其中有三十二万四千多人被选为模范和积极分子，在这些优秀人物中，有很多是巧厨师和优秀炊事员。云南省金平县优秀的炊事员兼保育员蔡贞妹，是一个关心集体生活而又非常能干的土族妇女，她在炼钢铁和秋收秋种的农忙季节，同一个五十多岁的老妈妈承担了一百多人的伙食，同时还带领十三个孩子，既做大锅饭，又为病人、小孩做软饭、稀饭。有一次她看见邻村十一户苗族社员食堂工作有困难，耽误了生产，她便动员苗族社员到自己的食堂来吃饭。全国这样优秀的人物有千千万，她们的工作是平凡的，然而却是真正伟大的。
