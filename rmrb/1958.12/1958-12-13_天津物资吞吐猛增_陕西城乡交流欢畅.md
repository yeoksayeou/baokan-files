Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th: Tianjin launched a commercial transport blitz on the 11th, the first day of the ten-day campaign. Nearly a thousand trucks and horse-drawn carts, fully loaded with industrial products or agricultural and sideline products, shuttled busily between stations, freight yards, and factories. The platforms of various freight yards were piled high with goods waiting to be shipped. More than 3,000 employees from the commercial sector formed a shock force for loading and unloading, working alongside the stevedores in an intense loading and unloading battle. In the 24 hours from 6:00 PM the day before yesterday to 6:00 PM yesterday, the volume of goods shipped from Tianjin to various locations increased by about 40% compared to normal, totaling over 12,000 tons. Among these were essential supplies urgently needed by rural areas, such as salt, kerosene, cotton cloth, woolen garments, handcart tires, medicine, and cigarettes, as well as packaging materials like burlap sacks, oil drums, and lead wire needed by rural areas to transport agricultural and sideline products. Because rural areas throughout Hebei Province began their commercial transport blitz on the 9th, the quantity of industrial raw materials and non-staple foods transported to Tianjin yesterday increased significantly. The daily volume of cotton, tobacco leaves, and hemp increased nearly twofold compared to the past, and the volume of non-staple foods such as vegetables, live pigs, cattle, sheep, and fruits also increased substantially.

Currently, Tianjin has a limited inventory of light industrial raw materials from rural areas, and the supply of non-staple foods remains relatively tight. Therefore, Tianjin's commercial departments are taking advantage of this transport blitz to dispatch a group of staff to various production areas to assist in transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 12th: On December 11th, Shaanxi Province's railway transportation departments transported more than 15,000 tons of various daily necessities to urban and rural areas throughout the province during the commercial material transport blitz. Currently, the supply of goods in cities, industrial and mining areas, and rural areas throughout the province has been replenished. The steelworkers in the mountains of southern Shaanxi have received vegetables and sweet potatoes transported from Guozhen in the Guanzhong Plain, and many county towns have received cloth, general merchandise, and other goods transported from Xi'an, Baoji, and other places. On the 11th, Xi'an City transported more than 1,500 tons of goods, more than double the usual amount. Many goods that were temporarily out of stock in the past have now been replenished. For example, 75 tons of peanuts and sesame transported from Qianxian and Chaoyi have provided processing materials for oil refineries. Porcelain items such as bowls and plates transported from Tongchuan have met the needs of newly started construction sites and the suburban people's commune canteens. The market also has Chinese cabbage transported from Weinan and jujubes transported from Dali.

To ensure the completion of this transport blitz task, the Shaanxi Provincial Commercial Department and Railway Department mobilized their employees. Two deputy directors of the Shaanxi Provincial Commercial Bureau personally led more than 300 cadres drawn from various trade bureaus to load 30 wagons of goods at the Xi'an Commodity Warehouse, transporting industrial products such as knitted goods, enamelware, general merchandise, and non-staple foods to various counties in the province. Railway employees at each station actively utilized methods such as carrying goods on freight cars, adding shipments on guard cars, and transporting goods on passenger cars to ensure that daily necessities were shipped as early as possible.

Currently, Shaanxi Province's commercial and railway departments are leveraging the experience of the transport blitz to redouble their efforts and strive to complete the transportation task of loading and transporting daily necessities for December ahead of schedule.

    天津物资吞吐猛增
    陕西城乡交流欢畅
    据新华社天津12日电  天津市在开展商业运输突击旬第一天——11日，出动了近千辆汽车马车，满载着工业品或农副产品，川流不息地奔驰在车站、货场和仓库工厂之间。各个货场的月台上堆满了待运的物资。商业部门三千多名职工组成的突击装卸大军和搬运工人一块儿投入紧张的装卸战斗。从前天下午六时到昨天下午六时的一昼夜间，由天津运往各地的物资比平常增加了40％左右，共有一万二千多吨；其中有目前农村迫切需要的食盐、煤油、棉布、绒衣、手推车外胎、药品、纸烟等，还有供农村调运农副产品所需要的麻袋、油桶、铅丝等包装物料。由于河北省各地农村在9日就开始了商业运输突击战，因而昨天运到天津的工业原料和副食品的数量有了显著增加，棉花、烟叶、大麻比过去每日调入量增加将近两倍，蔬菜、生猪、牛羊和水果等副食品也大量增加。
    目前，天津市来自农村的轻工业原料库存不多，副食品的供应也依然比较紧张。因此，天津商业部门趁这次突击运输的机会，已经派出一批工作人员分赴各产地去协助调运。
    据新华社西安12日电  陕西省铁路运输部门在11日的商业物资突击运输中，把一万五千多吨各种日用生活必需品运到省内城乡各地。目前这个省各城市、工矿区和农村商品的供应已得到补充。陕南山区的钢铁战士已得到从关中平原虢镇运去的蔬菜和红薯，不少县城已得到西安、宝鸡等地运去的布匹和日用百货。西安市在11日这一天运进的商品就达一千五百多吨，比平时增加一倍以上。过去许多暂时缺货的商品现在已得到补充。例如从乾县和朝邑运来的七十五吨花生和芝麻，已使炼油厂得到加工原料。从铜川运来的碗、盘等瓷器，已供应新开工的工地和郊区人民公社食堂需要；市场上还买到了从渭南运来的大白菜和大荔运来的红枣。
    为保证这次突击运输任务的完成，陕西省商业和铁道部门都向职工进行了动员，陕西省商业厅两个副厅长，亲自带领各贸易局抽出的三百多干部，在西安商品仓库总装了三十车商品，把针织、搪瓷、百货等工业品和副食品运给省内各县。各站的铁路职工，都积极利用货车捎运、守车加运和客车带运等办法，尽量使日用必需品早登程。
    现在，陕西省的商业和铁路部门正在运用突击运输的经验，再接再厉争取提前完成12月份装运日用生活必需品的运输任务。
