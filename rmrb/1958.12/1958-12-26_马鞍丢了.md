    Saddle Lost
    Ma Weixun
    Liu Wenlin, a member of the Sixth Production Team of the Red Star People's Commune in Wuqiao County, had just unloaded coal from the Sangyuan Town when the saddle on his cart was taken.
    "Who took my saddle?" Liu Wenlin shouted anxiously. "It's strange! The cart and horse belong to the commune, why steal the saddle?"
    Liu Wenlin's saddle wasn't stolen. Here's what happened:
    Liu Guoheng, the team's livestock feeder, was a man who loved animals like his own children. Whenever people returned livestock to the barn after using them, he would always carefully examine them from head to toe. This day, after Liu Wenlin returned the young black ox that pulled the cart, he examined it in the same meticulous way. During the inspection, he discovered that the ox's back had been rubbed bare of hair in two palm-sized patches. This distressed Liu Guoheng greatly. He thought, "It must be the saddle that rubbed it." He ran to the cart to inspect the saddle. Sure enough, there was a small hole in the saddle, and a lot of the chaff inside had been lost. He took the saddle back to his own home, refilled it with chaff, and sewed it up stitch by stitch before returning it to the cart.
      "I was getting worried, if you hadn't brought it back, I was going to start scolding."
    "I was also getting worried! If the ox gets rubbed raw again, I won't let you use it anymore," Liu Guoheng glared at Liu Wenlin.

    马鞍丢了   
    马伟勋
    吴桥县红星人民公社第六生产队社员刘文林从桑园镇拉煤回来，刚卸车不久，车上的马鞍子就被人拿走了。
    “谁拿走我的马鞍子啦？”刘文林着急的大声嚷叫。“真是怪！车、马都是公社的，还偷马鞍子干嘛？”
    刘文林的马鞍子并没被人偷走，原来是这么回事：
    这个队上的饲养员刘国衡是个爱畜如子的人，每逢人们用完牲口给他送到畜棚以后，他总是不放心的把牲口从头到尾检查一遍，这天刘文林把架辕的小黑牛给他送回以后，他照样详细检查了一遍。在检查中发现牛的脊背被磨掉了巴掌大的两片毛。可把刘国衡的心痛坏了，他想：“准是被马鞍子磨的。”他跑到车上去检查马鞍子。果然是因为马鞍子破了个小洞，里边装的糠丢了很多。他就把马鞍子拿回自己家去，装足糠，一针针的缝好后，才又送回车上。
      “我正着急呢，再不送回来我就要骂了。”
    “我也正着急呢！要再把牛磨坏，以后就不让你使了。”刘国衡盯了刘文林一眼。
