    Unified Planning, Specific Arrangements
    Large-Scale Afforestation of Woody Oil Plants in Various Regions

    (Our dispatch) In the winter afforestation campaign, oil tea is being planted everywhere in the south, and walnuts and other woody oil crops are being planted in large quantities in the north. This is an important measure to expand the sources of oil and enrich the diversified management of people's communes. Since the middle of last month, many people's communes in Shanxi Province have actively responded to the urgent call of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to plant walnut trees on a large scale, acting in a combat-like and militarized manner. After a month of hard work, more than 359 million walnut saplings have been sown. Anze County has planted an average of more than 2,000 walnut trees per household.
    While celebrating the bumper harvest and picking oil tea fruits in Jiangnan, various regions have selected sufficient oil tea seeds for large-scale sowing. Sichuan Province has decided to use all of the more than 17 million jin of tea seeds produced this year for afforestation. Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces and autonomous regions have selected and collected more than 70 million jin of seeds for planting a large number of oil tea trees. Guangdong Province has planted more than 2 million mu of oil tea forests last month. Xiangxiang County in Hunan Province has organized an army of 300,000 people to plant 600,000 mu of oil tea forests on the mountains, and is also preparing to strive to complete the task of afforesting one million mu of oil tea. From November 8th to 11th, the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province mobilized 2.3 million people across the prefecture for a four-day blitz, planting more than 1.25 million mu of economic forests such as oil tea and walnuts. Guizhou, Guangxi, Hubei and other provinces and autonomous regions are all sowing as they harvest. Jiangsu Province, which originally had few oil tea forests, will also develop them on a large scale this winter, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in edible oil in the province.
    In developing woody oil materials, the following measures have generally been taken in various regions:
    (1) People's communes have formulated plans for the development of woody and wild oil materials when formulating comprehensive production plans for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
    (2) The method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debates is adopted to enable the broad masses to understand the great significance of developing woody oil materials, promote the experience of high yields and bumper harvests, break the convention that bumper harvests cannot be achieved in off-years, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and lay the ideological foundation for the large-scale development of woody oil materials.
    (3) The commune establishes specialized teams, and allocates labor according to the season; solves the problems of seeds and technology; and conducts blitz afforestation in the manner of large-scale corps operations.

    统一规划  具体安排
    各地大造木本油料林
    本报讯  在冬季造林运动中，南方到处栽种油茶，北方大种核桃等木本油料作物，这是扩大油料来源和丰富人民公社多种经营内容的一项重要措施。山西省从上月中旬起，许多人民公社以战斗化、军事化的行动，积极响应省委和省人委大量种植核桃树的紧急号召，经过一个月的努力，已播种核桃三亿五千九百多万株。安泽县每户平均种核桃树两千多株。
    江南各地在油茶普庆丰收采摘油茶果子的同时，都选出了足够的油茶种子，大量进行播种。四川省决定将今年所产的一千七百多万斤茶籽，全部用以造林。浙江、安徽、广东、广西四省、区为大量栽种油茶树，选收了七千多万斤种子。广东省上月已造油茶林二百多万亩。湖南省湘乡县组织了三十万人的大军，上山造油茶林六十万亩，还准备争取完成百万亩的油茶造林任务。云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州，自11月8日至11日全州二百三十万人突击四天，造油茶、核桃等经济林一百二十五万多亩。贵州、广西、湖北等省、区都正在随采随播。原有油茶林不多的江苏省，今冬也要大量发展，逐步作到本省食油自给。
    各地在发展木本油料时，一般采取了以下措施：
    （一）人民公社在制订农、林、牧、副、渔全面生产规划时，都制订了发展木本和野生油料的规划。
    （二）采用大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，使广大群众了解发展木本油料的重大意义，推广高额丰产经验，打破小年不能丰产的常规，克服了右倾保守思想，为大量发展木本油料奠定思想基础。
    （三）公社成立专业队，并按季节调配劳力；解决种苗和技术问题；用大兵团作战方式，进行突击造林。
