    Taking Communist Education as the Key Link
    Integrating Rectification of the Commune with Production
    New Look in Production at the Chuandi Management District of the Red Flag Commune
    (Our dispatch) The Chuandi Management District of the Red Flag People's Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, has achieved preliminary experience in the movement to rectify the commune, taking Communist education as the key link and aiming to consolidate the commune and develop production. The Red Flag Commune is a large commune transformed from the merger of twenty-nine agricultural cooperatives. The predecessor of the Chuandi Management District was the May 1st Agricultural Cooperative led by Guo Yu'en, a national model agricultural laborer. This agricultural cooperative was known throughout the country for its good management and operation and has been a key cooperative directly led by the Ping Shun County Party Committee since the cooperative movement. After Ping Shun and Huguan counties were merged into Huguan County this autumn, the Huguan County Party Committee again made the Red Flag Commune a key commune and organized a work team to conduct a rectification pilot project in the Chuandi Management District.
    At the beginning of the rectification, two ideological obstacles were encountered. Some cadres and farmers did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the current rectification of the commune. They said that after the rural rectification movement, the cadres and farmers were highly motivated and highly aware, and would do whatever they were told, so there was nothing to rectify. In addition, some people were afraid of affecting production work, believing that production work was currently busy, and that they would rectify the commune well after completing the tasks of steelmaking, iron smelting, autumn harvest, and deep plowing. In response to this situation, the Party branch and the work team first organized the cadres to discuss the situation of realizing the communization, and combined it with the various situations and existing problems that have occurred after the communization to conduct research. This enabled the cadres to clearly understand the importance and long-term nature of the two-line struggle in the countryside, as well as the great significance of rectifying the commune for improving and consolidating the commune. After study and discussion, many cadres clarified their minds and gained a correct ideological understanding of the rectification of the commune. On this basis, a plan for rectifying the commune (including rectifying the Party and the League) was formulated.
    This management district closely integrated rectification with production. In order to closely integrate rectification with production, the Party branch established a unified leadership structure for rectification and production in the management district, unified forces, unified actions, and worked in a planned manner, putting forward the ideas of "rectify wherever you work" and "carry out Communist and Socialist education activities wherever there are people." It also adopted the method of "five concentrations": organizing the entire management district into one battalion, four companies, and twelve platoons, then concentrating Party and League members for training by battalion, concentrating labor, concentrating on airing views by company, concentrating on debates by platoon, and concentrating on solving problems. At the same time, with the company as a unit, propaganda and education, financial settlement, production planning, and life and welfare groups were established, so that rectification and production were combined, Party members and non-Party members were combined, and construction sites and rural areas were combined, and production and rectification competitions were launched. Because the form of rectification adapted to production, not only did members of all production fronts participate in the rectification activities, but also rectification was used as a driving force for promoting production. In one month, great achievements have been made in both aspects. According to statistics, a total of 15,000 big-character posters were posted and 19,000 opinions were put forward. At the same time, the autumn harvest task was completed and 31 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated. The production planning group put forward preliminary opinions on the production plan for 1959 to 1962, the financial settlement group handled the distribution issues, and half of the 210 debtors paid off their debts, and the financial system was improved.
    The Chuandi Management District generally adhered to the principle of democratic management in its operation and management. However, since the implementation of military organization, combat-oriented action, and collective living, some cadres have emphasized the practice of giving orders without paying attention to persuasion and education. The members aired many opinions on this. When the Party branch was solving the problem of cadres' work style, it selected two typical examples: one was the model of Wang Xiaoxian, the production brigade leader of Geyu, who ate, lived, and worked with the members at all times, and the other was the example of Gu Qishan, the labor brigade leader of Beiliutan, who did not go deep into reality, used coercion and command, and was divorced from the masses. A comparison was made, and Party and League members were organized to discuss it, so that everyone examined the mistakes of coercion and command, and realized that the more collective life is, the more we should care about the lives of the masses, and the more concentrated it is, the more we should talk about democracy. Immediately afterwards, the public canteens were rectified through the commune management committee, and a life and welfare system was democratically discussed and formulated. A general visit was made to the members, and after the visit, some of the life problems of the masses were reasonably arranged. For example, 42 rubber-wheeled carts were organized to transport 500,000 catties of coal, solving the problem of burning coal in winter. The labor organization was also rectified according to industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production, and a responsibility system and a evaluation and reward system were established, so that: there are arrangements every month and every season, there are plans for every area, and every team and every person has responsibilities. At present, a united and higher upsurge of winter production has been fully launched. After such rectification, the masses reflected that: this year's rectification was decisive, praised the good, criticized and corrected the bad, and really solved the problem.

### 以共产主义教育为纲  整社和生产密切结合  红旗社川底管理区生产出现新面貌

    以共产主义教育为纲
    整社和生产密切结合
    红旗社川底管理区生产出现新面貌
    本报讯  山西省壶关县红旗人民公社川底管理区以共产主义教育为纲，以巩固公社发展生产为目的的整顿公社运动，已经取得了初步的经验。红旗公社是由二十九个农业社合并转建的一个大型的公社。川底管理区前身是全国农业劳动模范郭玉恩领导的五一农业社，这个农业社曾以经营管理搞得好闻名全国，合作化以来一直是中共平顺县委直接领导的重点社。今年秋季平顺与壶关县合并为壶关县后，中共壶关县委又把红旗公社作为重点社，并组织工作组在川底管理区进行整顿试点工作。
    开始整顿的时候，首先遇到了两种思想障碍，有些干部和农民对当前整顿公社的意义认识不足。说经过农村整风运动，干部、农民干劲大，觉悟高，叫干啥就干啥没有什么可整的；另外有一部分人怕影响生产工作，认为现在生产工作繁忙，等完成了炼钢炼铁任务和秋收、深翻地等工作以后，再好好整顿。针对这种情况，党支部和工作组首先组织干部讨论了实现公社化的形势，并结合当前公社化后发生的种种情况和存在问题进行了研究。使干部明确认识了农村两条路线斗争的重要性和长期性，以及整顿公社对提高和巩固公社的伟大意义。许多干部经过学习讨论清醒了头脑，对整顿公社有了正确的思想认识。在此基础上制定出了整社（包括整党整团）方案。
    这个管理区在进行整顿时紧密结合生产进行。党支部为了使整社与生产紧密结合，建立了管理区整社、生产统一的领导机构，统一力量、统一行动，有计划地工作，提出了“在哪里劳动就在哪里整顿”；“哪里有人就在哪里开展共产主义和社会主义教育活动”。并采取了“五集中”的办法：将全管理区组成一个营、四个连、十二个排，随后按营集中训练党、团员，集中劳动，按连集中鸣放，按排集中辩论，集中解决问题。同时以连为单位，成立了宣传教育、财务结算、生产规划、生活福利等小组，使整社与生产结合，党内外结合，工地与农村结合，开展了生产、整社竞赛。由于整社形式适应生产不仅使各个生产战线的社员都参加整社活动，而且把整社作为推动生产的动力。一个月来两方面都获得很大成绩。据统计，共贴大字报一万五千张，提出意见一万九千条，同时完成了秋收任务，积肥三千一百万斤。生产规划小组提出了1959年至1962年生产规划的初步意见，财务结算组处理了分配问题，在二百一十个欠款户中有一半还清了欠款，健全了财务制度。
    川底管理区在经营管理上，一般地坚持了民主办社的原则。但自实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化以后，有些干部强调了下命令的作法，而不注意说服教育。社员对此鸣放了许多意见。党支部在解决干部作风问题时，选择了两个典型，一个是各峪生产大队长王小先时时刻刻与社员同吃同住同劳动的模范事例，一个是北流滩劳动大队长谷起山不深入实际、强迫命令，脱离群众的事例，进行了对比，组织党、团员进行了讨论，使大家都检查了强迫命令的错误，认识到生活越集体，就越要关心群众生活，越集中就越要讲民主的道理。紧接着又通过社管理委员会整顿了公共食堂，民主讨论制定了生活福利制度。对社员普遍进行了一次访问，经过访问，对群众中的一些生活问题，作了合理安排。如组织四十二辆胶皮车拉煤五十万斤，解决了过冬烧煤问题。对劳动组织，根据工业、农业、畜牧、副业等生产，也进行了整顿，建立了责任制和评比奖励制，达到了：月月季季有安排，条条块块有计划，队队人人有责任。目前，一个团结一致、更高的冬季生产高潮已经全面展开。经过这样整顿以后，群众反映说：今年整社当机立断，好的表扬，不好的批评改正，真解决问题。
