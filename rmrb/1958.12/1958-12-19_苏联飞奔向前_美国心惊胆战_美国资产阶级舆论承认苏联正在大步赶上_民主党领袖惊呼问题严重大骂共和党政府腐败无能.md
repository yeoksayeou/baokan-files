　　Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report – The scale of the Soviet Union’s Seven-Year Plan has greatly shocked and terrified the American bourgeoisie. American bourgeois newspapers are doing everything they can to distort the Soviet Union’s magnificent communist construction program, attempting to make readers believe that the Soviet Union cannot complete the Seven-Year Plan. However, as the saying goes, you can't hide the sun with your hand. American newspapers have to admit that the Soviet Union's plan to transform life is exceptionally grand. While the American magazine "Business Week" is spreading the idea that the Soviet Union is not competent to accomplish the tasks it has put forward, it also helplessly admits: "The Soviet Union has every possibility to achieve its established goals in the industrial field... because the Soviets have basically completed several Five-Year Plans in the past."

　　Some American bourgeois newspapers and commentators, when talking about the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, say that this reality should be faced squarely. "Newsweek," in an article about the draft of the Seven-Year Plan, indirectly said that the Soviet Union's achievements have always been "remarkable." The magazine's commentator, Lindley, wrote in an article entitled "We Cannot Ignore This": "There is no basis for us to doubt that the Soviet Union will complete this huge leap forward in the future. If we do not start walking faster, it will undoubtedly catch up with us, and may even surpass us." Therefore, this magazine warned that the Soviet Union is "remarkably rapidly shortening the distance" in its economic competition with the United States.

　　The liberal-leaning "Christian Science Monitor" wrote in an editorial: "Two communist countries are summoning the free world to participate in an economic and ideological competition. Moscow and Beijing have made frightening progress in consolidating their internal affairs... and they are constantly influencing undeveloped and neutral countries and their people with the tremendous effect of communism."

　　The New York stockbroker's newspaper, "The Wall Street Journal," has always been known for its careful and calm tone. But now it has also lost its composure and is nervously calling on God to help American capitalists fight this economic duel with the socialist world. The newspaper said: "We can no longer allow ourselves to sit back and relax... We should also put forward a program to mobilize all mankind to fight for its realization."

　　American newspapers do not hide the fact that their optimistic predictions for the rapid "recovery" of the American economy are on the verge of bankruptcy. "The New Republic" magazine said mournfully: "The contrast between the United States, which has incurred billions of dollars in losses due to a year-long decline in production, and Moscow, which is forging ahead, is very undignified and terrifying."

　　This uneasy voice was also revealed in a conversation by "New York Times" editor Catledge, who said: "When it comes to this economic plan (referring to the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan), we (referring to Americans) feel that the breath of the Soviet Union is already behind our heads. They are only two steps away from us, and they are only ten years behind us in terms of developing production." Mr. Hancher, the president of the University of Iowa, also said that the Soviet Union will be able to guarantee the highest standard of living in the world in the near future. "If the Russian system finally achieves the highest standard of living in the world, then what will we do at that time?" Although Mr. Hancher did not frankly talk about what to do "at that time," the capitalists in the United States and the politicians who serve the capitalists are increasingly unable to hide their unease and panic about this "damnable" question.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 17th – New York dispatch: Prominent American bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann published articles in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 13th and 14th, expressing infinite concern about the prospects of the United States competing peacefully with the Soviet Union in the economic field.

　　Lippmann particularly mentioned that the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in per capita output in the next few years. In contrast, he couldn't help but feel worried. He said: "The communists will win this competition unless we rapidly increase productivity beyond the current level."

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 17th – TASS Washington dispatch, December 16th: The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Butler, said in a speech to members of the National Women's Democratic Club that the United States is currently facing the "most serious challenge" from socialist countries. He attacked the Republican government's corruption and incompetence.

　　Butler said that the quality of the Soviet education system is very high. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to education and trains more scientists and specialized technical personnel every year than the United States.

　　Butler said that the most serious "challenge" to the United States is the economic development of the Soviet Union. He said, "Once upon a time, the Soviet Union was considered a backward agricultural country destroyed by World War II." He pointed out that due to the resolute implementation of industrialization plans, the Soviet Union's economy is rising day by day, but in the past five years, the United States' production has only increased by 1.3%, and in fact decreased last year.

　　Butler then launched a series of sharp attacks on the Republican government, saying that the Republican government has never put forward a plan that meets the requirements of national economic development and growth in the six years since it took office. The United States has also encountered great difficulties in the construction of housing, schools, hospitals, airports, etc. Butler said that more than 15 million Americans live in slums.

### 苏联飞奔向前  美国心惊胆战  美国资产阶级舆论承认苏联正在大步赶上  民主党领袖惊呼问题严重大骂共和党政府腐败无能

    苏联飞奔向前  美国心惊胆战
    美国资产阶级舆论承认苏联正在大步赶上
    民主党领袖惊呼问题严重大骂共和党政府腐败无能
    本报综合报道  苏联的七年计划的规模使美国资产阶级十分震惊和恐慌，美国的资产阶级报纸在尽其所能地来歪曲苏联的宏伟的共产主义建设纲领，企图使读者相信苏联不可能完成七年计划。但是，常言说得好，手掌遮不住太阳。美国的报纸也不得不承认，苏联的改造生活的计划是异常宏伟的。美国“商业周刊”杂志就一方面在散布苏联不能胜任所提出的任务，一方面又无可奈何地承认：“苏联有一切可能来达到工业方面既定的目标……因为苏维埃在过去已基本上完成了几个五年计划”。
    一些美国资产阶级的报刊和评论员，在谈到苏联七年计划的时候，都说应当正视这一现实。“新闻周刊”在一篇关于七年计划草案的文章里旁敲侧击地说，苏联的成就一直都是“了不起的”。这家杂志的评论员林德里在一篇以“我们不能够忽视这个”为题的文章中写道：“没有任何根据使我们怀疑：苏联将来要完成这一向前的巨大跃进。如果我们还不开始快步走，它无疑要赶上我们，甚至可能要超过我们”。因此，这家杂志警告说：苏联在同美国的经济竞赛中“异常迅速地缩短了距离”。
    带有自由主义色彩的“基督教科学箴言报”在一篇编辑部的文章里写道：“两个共产主义国家在召唤自由世界去参加经济上和思想上的竞赛。莫斯科和北京在巩固它们的内部事务方面作出了骇人听闻的进步……而且它们用共产主义的巨大效果在不断地影响那些不发达的和中立的国家以及这些国家的人民”。
    纽约股票经纪人的报刊“华尔街日报”向来以谨言和冷静著称。但是现在它也丧失了自持力并且神经质地呼吁上帝来帮助美国资本家同社会主义世界进行这场经济决斗。这家报纸说：“我们不能再允许自己高枕无忧了……我们应当也提出一个鼓动全人类为其实现而斗争的纲领”。
    美国的报纸并不掩饰它们对于美国经济迅速“复苏”的乐观预测已濒于破产边缘。“新共和”杂志忧郁地说：“在由于持续一年之久的生产下降而招致几十亿美元损失的美国和一往直前的莫斯科之间的对照，是十分不体面和可怕的”。
    这种不安的声音在“纽约时报”编辑凯特列奇的谈话里也流露了出来，他说：“如果谈到这个经济计划（指苏联七年计划），我们（指美国人）就会感到在后脑勺后已有苏联的气息，他们离我们两步之远，他们在发展生产方面只落后于我们十年”。衣阿华州大学校长汗契尔先生也说，苏联在不久的将来就可以保证世界上最高的生活水平。“如果俄国的制度终于得到世界上最高的生活水平，那么到了那个时候我们怎么办呢？”尽管汗契尔先生没有坦率地谈出“到了那个时候”又要如何，但是美国的资本家和为资本家效劳的政客们对于这个“可诅咒的”问题却越来越无法掩盖他们的不安和恐慌。
    新华社17日讯  纽约消息：美国著名资产阶级评论员李普曼在13日和14日的“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表文章，对于美国在经济方面同苏联进行和平竞赛的前景无限担忧。
    李普曼特别提到，苏联在今后几年内就要在按人口平均的产量方面超过美国。相形之下，他不禁愁思满腔。他说：“共产党人将会在这次竞赛中取得胜利，除非我们使生产率迅速超过现在的水平。”
    新华社17日讯  据塔斯社华盛顿16日讯：美国民主党全国委员会主席巴特勒向全国妇女民主俱乐部成员发表演说时说，美国目前面临着来自社会主义阵营国家“最严重的挑战”，他攻击共和党政府的腐败和无能。
    巴特勒说，苏联教育制度的质量很高，苏联十分重视教育问题，每年培养出来的科学家和专门技术人材多于美国。
    巴特勒说，对美国的最严重的“挑战”是苏联的经济发展。他说，“曾几何时苏联被认为是被第二次世界大战破坏了的落后的农业国。”他指出，由于坚决实行工业化计划，苏联的经济日益高涨，可是最近五年来美国的生产量却仅仅增加了1.3％，而去年事实上减少了生产。
    巴特勒接着对共和党政府进行了一系列尖锐的攻击，他说，共和党政府执政六年以来从未提出过符合国家经济发展和增长要求的计划。美国在住宅、学校、病院、机场等的建设方面也遭到很大的困难。巴特勒说，有一千五百多万美国人住在贫民窟里。
