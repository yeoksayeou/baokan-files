From the Perspective of Scientific Research Work on the Relationship Between Mental and Physical Labor
Zhu Hongyuan, Chen Zhongmo

After reading Wei Gao's article "Forever Need Pure Mental Laborers," we feel that Comrade Wei Gao has many erroneous viewpoints, one of which is an incorrect understanding of the relationship between scientific work and material production labor.

For example, Comrade Wei Gao believes: "The current work-study system, for those studying theoretical physics, can only train their thinking and cannot improve their professional skills. Because it cannot be fully integrated with the major, it is not the most perfect training method."

Theoretical Physics Research Also Needs to Be Familiar with Material Production Labor

We are both engaged in theoretical physics work, so we feel compelled to express our views on this issue as well. We do not intend to comprehensively explore the existing work-study system, but we want to point out that all natural science knowledge comes from practice, from labor, or more precisely, from physical labor.

If we carefully observe the actions of various machines, we can find that many machines, including modern machines, largely repeat or imitate human labor. Aren't the two large shovels of a giant automatic walking excavator a simulation of people scooping up sand with their hands? Isn't the long arm extended by a large crane a reproduction of the structure of human hands? The mechanical hand on display in the Beijing Exhibition Hall, which is widely used in modern atomic energy undertakings, directly imitates the movements of the hand.

Of course, when it comes to the relationship between scientific knowledge and material production labor, it should not be considered that science is merely imitating people's labor movements, but scientific knowledge, in the final analysis, is only the improvement and summary of production experience, and further solves the problems raised in production. The correctness of knowledge also depends on the final test in actual production struggles. So-called knowledge that is divorced from practice is, at best, a flower that bears no fruit.

Then, in various scientific fields, is there a special theoretical research department that does not need to be combined with production labor—theoretical physics?

Our answer to this question is that theoretical physics research also needs to be familiar with material production labor, people engaged in theoretical physics work also need to participate in labor training, and the training of theoretical physics workers also needs to implement a work-study system.

It is unlikely that we can imagine a theoretical physicist who is unfamiliar with the actual operation of atomic reactors and certain technological processes to design efficient and satisfactory reactors; similarly, we cannot imagine a theoretical physicist who is unfamiliar with devices that generate thermonuclear reactions, such as "Ogra," to propose a feasible plan for achieving thermonuclear reactions. There are many examples of theoretical physicists drawing wrong conclusions due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation.

For example, there was a famous German theoretical physicist named Sommerfeld, whose extensive work was in the fields of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. In his early years, he did a lot of work in the area of electromagnetic wave propagation. One of his fairly well-known works was using Maxwell's equations to deduce the law of electromagnetic wave propagation on the Earth's surface. Sommerfeld's research on this issue concluded that the longer the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave used for transmitting signals, the further the propagation area would be. In the history of radio development, everyone used long waves for a period of time. One of the reasons was the influence of Sommerfeld's theory. Later, people discovered from communication practice that the fact was exactly the opposite of Sommerfeld's prediction: the shorter the wavelength (of course, there is a limit), the further the propagation area. The reason is that Sommerfeld did not consider that there is an ionosphere in the sky that can reflect radio waves.

To give another recent example, using the pinch effect of a powerful current in a plasma to achieve a controllable thermonuclear reaction is one of the important directions of atomic energy scientific research. The initial theory about this phenomenon assumed that the pinch process had quasi-stability. Extensive practice has proved that this theory is far from the actual situation. The actual situation is far more complicated than theorists imagined. Violent shock waves and charged particle acceleration mechanisms are generated during the pinch process. To clarify these phenomena, more comprehensive practice and more theoretical research are necessary. This is another example of practice opening up a broad path for theory.

Stories like Sommerfeld's theoretical errors and lessons like those learned in the process of researching thermonuclear reactions are far from isolated in the history of the development of theoretical physics. The fundamental reason is that theory is always only an approximately correct reflection of reality, and the richness of the content revealed by production practice is far richer than theorists imagine. Therefore, from this point of view, what's wrong with theoretical physicists having the opportunity to participate in production labor and get more opportunities to learn from reality? In particular, people who study theoretical physics often suffer from a kind of occupational disease, often with ideological methods that do not proceed from reality, and simplify and abstract the rich actual situation. Undoubtedly, participating in physical labor will be of great significance in correcting their ideological methods that are divorced from reality.

It is Unreasonable to Require Direct Combination of Labor and All Book Knowledge

Perhaps some people think that a large part of the work in the field of theoretical physics research is still in the research stage and has not matured to the point where it can be directly applied to production practice; then wouldn't this part of the work have no connection with production?

Indeed, in the current field of theoretical physics research, a considerable part of the field has not matured to the point where it can be directly applied to production. Perhaps this is also one of the reasons why Comrade Wei Gao feels that the existing work-study system cannot be combined with his major. However, we feel that the combination of participation in material production labor and theoretical physics education should not be understood in a very narrow sense. When anyone participates in labor, no matter what kind of labor he is engaged in, this labor is always a specific work, and it always belongs to a relatively narrow scope. When using a lathe in a workshop to perform cutting work, of course, it will not be combined with the theory of internal combustion engines. In this sense, it is unreasonable in itself to require all kinds of work to be directly combined with all the knowledge in books. If we are not pursuing this narrow combination, then why would we feel that there is no connection between participation in material production labor and theoretical physics, which summarizes the fundamental laws of the physical movement of the material world? It is very dangerous to study and learn theoretical physics but not understand the concrete embodiment of the laws of theoretical physics in practice, and not be able to apply the physical laws determined by theoretical physics to solve practical problems. Can we think that a comrade who is familiar with the law of conservation of energy has mastered the knowledge of theoretical physics if he cannot find out the errors in the design of an imaginary perpetual motion machine? Fundamentally speaking, even if there is still a part of the existing theoretical physics knowledge that has not found its direct use, the purpose of our research on these problems is ultimately for production. When developing a newly established material production department, it is impossible to imagine that this newly established production department will have no connection with the old production department. New things always develop from old things. Atomic power plants are, of course, a newer technology than old-fashioned thermal power plants, but can atomic power plants do without the old steam turbine technology? Can we do without the old power transmission technology? In addition, if comrades who are familiar with material production labor can participate in the work of theoretical physics research, it will obviously be easier to open up new avenues for theoretical physics to be applied to production practice.

Creative Labor is Always Produced on the Basis of Repetitive Labor

In the history of science, scientists have made important achievements, but the significance of this achievement is often explained by others and applied to production practice by others. Such examples are not uncommon. This phenomenon seems like a comedy, but it is actually a tragedy. Does our scientific education system still want to repeat this historical tragedy?

Why did Comrade Wei Gao have the above-mentioned erroneous views? We feel that this is still inseparable from his incorrect understanding and understanding of labor. For example, Comrade Wei Gao complains that there is too much repetitive work in the existing work-study system, which is not suitable for professional training and is utilitarian labor. We feel that this statement is inappropriate. Labor always has its social purpose and always has to contribute to society and be useful to others. Labor that does not produce use value is meaningless. Secondly, labor is always repetitive, and creative labor is always produced on the basis of repetitive labor.

It seems that scientific research work is the most creative kind of labor. However, if we take a slight look at scientific research work, we can find that the so-called "creative" scientific research work actually has a lot of ordinary, repetitive labor.

To give a scientific example. Madam Curie was able to extract radium from pitchblende after processing a large amount of ore, repeatedly moving the ore back and forth, repeatedly pouring various solutions, and finally succeeded. The work that Madam Curie was engaged in was not only a large amount of repetitive labor, but also contained a considerable part of heavy physical labor. Comrade Wei Gao's major is atomic energy, but is engaging in atomic energy work just "understanding the problems existing in installation work," as Comrade Wei Gao said? Before the newly built atomic piles and accelerators in our country are completed, isn't the first thing that comrades engaged in atomic energy undertakings do precisely installation work? Comrades who have done scientific experiments know that in scientific research, the most laborious and time-consuming is the manufacture and installation of instruments and equipment, and the time for actually recording data only accounts for a very small amount of time. Perhaps Comrade Wei Gao would think that the research work of theoretical physics is an exception, but the research of theoretical physics also includes a large amount of repetitive labor. For example, it often requires a large amount of numerical calculation, that is, a large amount of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It often involves multiplying long numbers of seven or eight digits back and forth, and often calculating for a problem for two or three months or even half a year. Of course, we don't want to overemphasize the proportion of physical labor in laboratory work, because that will be understood as: it seems that scientific researchers can transform themselves as long as they participate in laboratory work. In fact, the physical labor required by the laboratory is often not entirely undertaken by scientific researchers. For example, the manufacture of certain experimental instruments is undertaken by the gold factory of the research institute or school. However, the existence of a large amount of repetitive work in the laboratory is completely a fact. For example, "repeated testing, welding," etc., which Comrade Wei Gao thinks is not very necessary, is almost done every day. However, the achievements of scientific research are produced from this ordinary repetitive labor. Therefore, creativity is always carried out on the basis of repetition, and without repetition, there is no creativity.

From this point of view, don't we have more reason to think that those comrades who despise the importance of repetitive labor need to experience the profound meaning of this repetitive labor more?

    从科学研究工作看脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系
    朱洪元  陈中谟
    我们读了魏高的“永远需要单纯的脑力劳动者”一文以后，感到魏高同学有许多错误观点，其中的一个便是对于科学工作和物质生产劳动的关系理解得不正确。
    例如，魏高同学认为：“现在的半工半读制度对于学理论物理的人说来，只能使思想得到锻炼，而不能使业务有所提高。因为它不能完全结合专业，所以它不是最完善的培养方法。”
    理论物理研究同样需要熟悉物质生产劳动
    我们都是从事理论物理方面的工作的，因而我们感到不得不对这个问题也来发表一点意见。我们不打算全面地探讨现有半工半读制度，但是我们想指出一点，一切自然科学知识的来源都是来自实践，来自劳动，或者更准确点说，都是来自体力劳动。
    假如我们仔细地观察一下各种机器的动作，便可以发现许多机器，包括现代化的机器在内，都是在极大程度上重复或者是模仿人的劳动。巨型的自动走动掘土机的两只大的铲子，不正是人们用两手捧起沙土的动作的模拟吗？大型的起重机所伸出去的长长的长臂，不正是人的两只手的结构的再现吗？在北京展览馆中，陈列了一副现代原子能事业中应用得十分广泛的机械手，更是直接地模仿了手的动作。
    当然，讲到科学知识对于物质生产劳动的关系，决不能认为仅仅就是科学在模仿人们的劳动动作，但是科学知识归根究底只不过是生产经验的提高和总结，并进一步解决生产中所提出的问题。知识的正确与否，也有赖于最后拿到实际的生产斗争中去检验。离开了实践的所谓知识，最多也不过是一朵不结果实的花朵而已。
    那末在各个科学领域内，有没有一个特殊的不需要和生产劳动相结合的例外的理论研究部门——理论物理呢？
    对于这个问题，我们的答案是，理论物理的研究也同样需要熟悉物质生产劳动，从事理论物理工作的人也同样有必要参加劳动锻炼，对于理论物理工作者的培养也同样需要实行半工半读的制度。
    我们不大可能设想，一个不熟悉原子反应堆操作运转的实际状况以及某些工艺过程的理论物理学家，会设计出效率高的、合乎需要的反应堆来；同样，我们也不能设想，一个不熟悉产生热核反应的装置如“奥格拉”等的理论物理工作者，会提出一个切实可行的实现热核反应的方案。理论物理学家由于不明了实际情况而得出了错误的结论的例子是很多的。
    举例来说，德国有一个著名的理论物理学家索末菲尔德，他的大量的工作是在原子结构和量子力学方面。他在早期，在电磁波传播方面做过不少工作。他的相当著名的一个工作，是用马克斯威方程式推导电磁波在地球表面上传导的规律。索末菲尔德研究了这个问题所得到的结论是：传播讯号用的电磁波的波长愈长，那末传播的区域就愈远。在无线电发展史上，曾经有一个时期大家都用长波。原因之一就是受了索末菲尔德的理论的影响。后来，人们从通讯的实践中发现事实恰和索末菲尔德所预言的结论相反，波长愈短（当然有一个限度），所能传播的区域愈远。原因是索末菲尔德没有考虑到天空中有一个能反射无线电波的电离层。
    再举一个最近的例子，应用等离子区中强大电流的箝制作用实现可控制的热核反应，是原子能科学研究的重要方向之一。关于这一现象最初的理论假定了箝制过程具有准稳定性，广泛的实践证明这一理论和实际情况相去很远。实际情况远较理论家所想像的为复杂。在箝制过程中产生了猛烈的冲击波，和带电粒子的加速机构。为了阐明这些现象，必须作更全面的实践和更多的理论研究，这是实践为理论开辟宽广道路的又一例子。
    像索末菲尔德这类理论发生错误的故事，像研究热核反应过程中发生的这类经验教训，在理论物理学发展的历史上远不是个别的。根本的原因就在于：理论永远只是实际的一个近似的正确反映，生产实践所揭示出的内容的丰富性，远比理论家所想像的要丰富得多。因此，从这种观点看来，理论物理学家有机会参加生产劳动，多得到一点向实际学习的机会，又有什么不好呢？特别是学理论物理的人，往往患有一种职业病，往往是思想方法不从实际出发，把丰富的实际情况加以简单化、抽象化。而无疑的是，参加体力劳动，对于矫正他们脱离实际的思想方法，会有很重要的意义。
    要求劳动和全部书本知识直接结合是不合理的
    也许有人认为，理论物理的研究领域内有很大一部分工作还在研究阶段，还没有成熟到可以直接应用到生产实践上去；那末岂不是这部分工作便和生产没有联系？
    确实，在目前的理论物理研究领域中，有相当大部分领域还没有成熟到直接应用到生产上去。也许这也就是魏高同学感到现有半工半读制度不能和专业相结合的原因之一。不过，我们感到，参加物质资料生产劳动和理论物理的教育的结合，不能从一种非常狭隘的意义上来了解。任何人在参加劳动时，不论他从事什么性质的劳动，这种劳动总是一种具体的工作，并且它总要从属于一个比较狭隘的范围。在车间里面使用车床来进行切削工作时，当然不会和内燃机的理论有什么结合。从这个意义上讲，要求各种工作都和书本上的全部知识直接相结合，这本身就是不合理的。假如我们不是追求这种狭义的结合，那末为什么会感到参加物质资料生产劳动和概括了物质世界的物理运动根本规律的理论物理没有联系呢？研究和学习理论物理，却不了解理论物理的规律在实际中的具体体现，不会把理论物理所确定的物理规律应用来解决实际问题，这是很危险的。一位熟读了能量守恒定律的同志，却不会找出一架空想的永动机设计的错误，我们能认为他已经掌握了理论物理的知识吗？从根本上讲，即使现有的理论物理知识中还有一部分知识没有找到它的直接的用途，但是我们研究这些问题的目的，终究是为了生产。在发展一个新创立的物质生产部门时，也不可能设想这个新创立的生产部门会和老的生产部门没有任何联系。新的东西总是从旧的东西发展出来的。原子能发电站对旧式的火力发电站来说，当然是一种较新的技术，但是在原子能发电站中能够不用到老的蒸汽透平的技术吗？能够不用到老的输电技术吗？另外，如果在理论物理的研究工作中，能有熟悉物质生产劳动的同志来参加工作，显然就将更容易为理论物理开辟出应用到生产实践上的新的道路。
    创造性的劳动总是在重复性的劳动基础上产生的
    在科学史上，科学家作出了重要成果，但这个成果的意义却往往要由别人来替他阐明，替他应用到生产实践中去，这类例子是屡见不鲜的。这种现象，看来是一个喜剧，其实是一个悲剧。难道我们的科学教育制度还要重复这种历史上的悲剧吗？
    为什么魏高同学会产生以上这些错误看法呢？我们感到，这还和他错误的认识和理解劳动分不开。例如魏高同学抱怨现有半工半读制度中重复性的工作过多，不适宜于业务培养，是使用性的劳动等等。我们感到这种说法不恰当。劳动总是有它的社会目的性，总要对于社会有贡献，对别人有用。不产生使用价值的劳动是没有意义的。其次，劳动总是带有重复性的，创造性的劳动总是在重复性的劳动基础上产生的。
    看起来科学研究工作好像是最带有创造性的一种劳动了。不过，假如略为考察一下科学研究工作便可以发现，所谓“创造性”的科学研究工作，实际上有着大量的、平凡的、重复性的劳动。
    举个科学上的例子。居里夫人能够从沥青铀矿中提炼出镭，是经过大量的矿石处理，重复地把矿石移来移去，重复地把各种溶液倒来倒去，最后才得到成功的。居里夫人所从事的工作，不仅是大量的重复性的劳动，而且还包含相当大一部分繁重的体力劳动。魏高同学的专业是原子能，但是从事原子能工作是不是如像魏高同学所说：“只要了解一下安装等工作中存在的问题就可以了”呢？难道在我国新建的原子堆和加速器在建成之前，那些从事原子能事业的同志们所进行的工作不首先正是安装工作吗？从事过科学实验的同志们都知道，在科学研究中，最费力也最占去大部分时间的就是仪器和设备的制造和安装，而真正记录数据的时间却只占极少的时间。也许魏高同学会认为理论物理的研究工作是例外的吧，可是，理论物理的研究中也包含了大量的重复性劳动。例如，它常常要作大量的数字计算，也就是要作大量的加、减、乘、除。常常要把七、八位长长的数字乘来乘去，而且常常要为一个问题算上两、三个月乃至大半年。当然，我们并不想过分夸大在实验室工作中体力劳动所占的比重，因为那将会被人了解为：仿佛科学研究人员只要参加实验室工作就可以改造自己了。而实际上，实验室所需要的体力劳动，常常不是由科学研究人员全部担任的。例如，某些试验仪器的制造，就是由研究所或学校的金工厂来承担的。但是实验室中存在着大量的重复性工作却完全是事实。例如魏高同学所认为不很必要的“重复测试、焊接”等等，就几乎是天天要作。可是，科学研究的成果正是产生于这种平凡的重复性的劳动之中。所以说，创造总是在重复的基础上进行的，没有重复就没有创造。
    由此看来，难道我们不是更有理由认为：那些轻视重复性劳动的重要意义的同志们，更有必要多多地体验一下这种重复性劳动的深刻意义吗？
