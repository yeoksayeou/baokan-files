    A Group of Warriors Transforming Customs and Habits
    Hu Shaohua, First Secretary of the Xinxiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    "The cadres sent down are truly great, taking the lead in all kinds of work.
    After a period of getting along and working together, we are like close brothers.
    In school, you were my teacher; down in the fields, you willingly become my student.
    Technological innovation is your magic touch, and you are pioneers in publicizing current events.
    Managing welfare and promoting hygiene, there are still many things I can't fully describe.
    Are you farmers or students? It's hard to tell, with all your abilities."
    This is a poem by farmers in Xiaoji Town praising the cadres sent down. This year, more than seven hundred cadres from central government organs, Henan Province, and the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee organs have been sent down to Xinxiang County for labor training. When these comrades first arrived, most of them were indeed physically weak and unfamiliar with agriculture, lacking common language with the masses. After labor training, and participating in rural rectification and socialist debates and other political movements, they not only changed their views of belittling labor, learned to work, and raised their political consciousness, but also greatly promoted local work. The praise from the farmers of Xiaoji Town is not an exaggeration.
    When it comes to the labor of the cadres sent down, the commune members always say: "They are really 'po fen'" (meaning willing to work). During the strengthening of cotton field management, the cadres sent down to Wangtun Brigade by the First Ministry of Machine Building proposed: "Don't be afraid of sweating in the hot weather, don't be afraid of wind, rain, or thunderstorms. The most heat will give you a tan, the most sweat will soak your clothes. The more the skin is tanned, the stronger it becomes; the clothes can be washed after they are wet." During the rice transplanting campaign, the cadres sent down soaked in the water day and night with the masses. Even with cut feet and swollen legs, they remained enthusiastic and persevered to the end. During the flood season, many cadres sent down patrolled the riverbanks day and night, and even when sick, they refused to leave the front line. Li Yannong saw a riverbank breach and immediately jumped into the river to block it with his body. Wang Guimei also twice went into the water to take off her cotton coat to block the breach. The cadres sent down learned the good qualities of cherishing labor from the peasant masses, and their selfless attitude towards labor, in turn, educated the peasants, promoting the transformation of customs and habits in the countryside and raising the red banner of labor being glorious. Wang Aisheng, who was sent down to Guandi, took the lead in digging sludge in the pond in winter, his legs frozen blue. When the masses saw this, without a word, they all took off their shoes and socks and jumped into the pit. Originally, some farmers were not at ease with agricultural production and blindly ran to the cities. Although some elderly people had worked all their lives, they always felt that working in the fields had no future and wanted to find an opportunity for their children to leave production and become cadres. Seeing that the Party sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to eat, live, and work with the peasants, their views changed. People who had blindly flowed into the cities slowly returned. A commune member in Qiliying saw that everyone else had returned from the city, but his son had not yet returned, so he personally went to the city to call his son back. Middle school and high school graduates also expressed their determination, saying: "Even university students are coming down to work, what can I, a middle school student, say? Just watch, I am determined to dedicate my youth to the countryside and build a beautiful hometown." The elderly regarded the cadres sent down as role models for educating their children. An old commune member in Zhaodi, whose son did not like to work, taught his son a lesson, saying: "Didn't you see that ministers and section chiefs have come down to work? You are young and don't work. I think we should let the cadres sent down give you a lesson!" In the past, some grassroots cadres did not pay much attention to participating in labor, and the masses had a lot of complaints about this situation. This spring, the Party called on cadres to plant experimental fields, coupled with the labor training of the cadres sent down, those who did not participate in labor actively participated in labor. The Party Branch Secretary of a production brigade used to sleep late in the morning after a meeting at night and did not go to the fields. After the cadres sent down arrived, they waited for the commune members at his door early every morning to go to the fields together. This Party Branch Secretary never slept late again, and not only went to the fields to work early every morning but also implemented the method of working in the fields. The cadres sent down and grassroots cadres went to work early and returned late, enduring hardship first, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. In the past, Zhao Village Brigade never had more than 300 people attending work, but soon after the cadres sent down arrived, it suddenly increased to 400 people. Even the old accountant who had not worked for many years and the newly married daughter-in-law went to work in the fields as an exception. The Party Branch Secretary of Bao'an Dyke said: "In the past, we couldn't get people to work even with gongs and drums, but now, as soon as the bell rings, everyone is in the fields."
    Several hundred cadres sent down displayed their skills in the cultural and technological revolutions. They actively participated in the agricultural tool reform movement, creating, improving, and popularizing more than 3,000 new agricultural tools. A large proportion of the cadres sent down to Xinxiang were comrades from the First Ministry of Machine Building, and their help to the communes in developing industry was particularly great. With the help of these comrades, with the upsurge of establishing people's communes, in a short half month, every team established a factory, and every commune had machines running. The county developed from the original twenty-eight factories to three thousand and two hundred factories. On the cultural front, they were even more active. In Xinxiang County, they personally established seventy-seven elementary school classes, sixty-three middle school classes, seventy red and expert university classes, and three hundred and seventy-nine literacy classes. Almost every cadre sent down served as a teacher and created many good teaching methods. The masses all said: "It would be difficult to hire such good teachers even with a lot of money." The propaganda work and recreational activities in the countryside have also become more active with the participation of the cadres sent down. They helped set up many clubs, reading groups, cultural work troupes, production bulletins, and so on.
    In Xinxiang County, it is indeed true that wherever there are cadres sent down, the work is advanced. Whenever a task is assigned, the cadres sent down always take the lead, publicize, and help grassroots cadres come up with ideas and make plans, becoming the most active force in the countryside in implementing the Party's policies. For example, Qiliying Commune, where production and other tasks have always been done very well, but the sanitation work was not very outstanding. This year, after the Party issued the call to eliminate the four pests, although the commune Party committee attached great importance to it, some cadres still only cared about production and did not pay attention to sanitation. However, the cadres sent down, on the one hand, publicized, and on the other hand, took action and worked hard, repairing toilets, making latrine covers, painting houses, beautifying walls... The sanitation work in Qiliying quickly achieved remarkable results.
    The cadres sent down not only actively participated in labor and contributed cultural and technical knowledge to the countryside, but also put down their airs and integrated with the masses, establishing a relationship as close as flesh and blood. It is common for the cadres sent down to wash pots and dishes, carry water, grind flour, hold children, and take care of household chores for the masses. The masses also regard the cadres sent down as their most trusted relatives. They always leave the best things in their homes for the cadres sent down to eat. Some comrades go to the fields to work, and the old women quietly put eggs and dry food in their pockets without them knowing. When something happens in the homes of the masses, they also like to consult with the cadres sent down. If there is discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, they ask the cadres sent down to mediate. If they need to weigh grain, record work points, or even write letters to their fianc√©s, young girls ask the cadres sent down to give advice. The family-like relationship between the cadres sent down and the masses has played a great role in strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. The masses said that the cadres from the land reform period have returned again. The masses also wholeheartedly support the Party's cadre policy. The elderly often say: "It would be a real mistake to hand over the people's country to this group of young people who don't know the difficulties of managing a household. Chairman Mao is so wise to let them come to labor and train them to be both capable in writing and in martial arts. When they go back to work, they will have a better understanding, and the people's country will become as solid as iron." This is the best evaluation of our Party's cadre policy.
