    A Group of Warriors Transforming Customs and Habits
    Hu Shaohua, First Secretary of the Xinxiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    "The cadres sent down are truly great, taking the lead in all kinds of work.
    After a period of getting along and working together, we are like close brothers.
    In school, you were my teacher; down in the fields, you willingly become my student.
    Technological innovation is your magic touch, and you are pioneers in publicizing current events.
    Managing welfare and promoting hygiene, there are still many things I can't fully describe.
    Are you farmers or students? It's hard to tell, with all your abilities."
    This is a poem by farmers in Xiaoji Town praising the cadres sent down. This year, more than seven hundred cadres from central government organs, Henan Province, and the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee organs have been sent down to Xinxiang County for labor training. When these comrades first arrived, most of them were indeed physically weak and unfamiliar with agriculture, lacking common language with the masses. After labor training, and participating in rural rectification and socialist debates and other political movements, they not only changed their views of belittling labor, learned to work, and raised their political consciousness, but also greatly promoted local work. The praise from the farmers of Xiaoji Town is not an exaggeration.
    When it comes to the labor of the cadres sent down, the commune members always say: "They are really 'po fen'" (meaning willing to work). During the strengthening of cotton field management, the cadres sent down to Wangtun Brigade by the First Ministry of Machine Building proposed: "Don't be afraid of sweating in the hot weather, don't be afraid of wind, rain, or thunderstorms. The most heat will give you a tan, the most sweat will soak your clothes. The more the skin is tanned, the stronger it becomes; the clothes can be washed after they are wet." During the rice transplanting campaign, the cadres sent down soaked in the water day and night with the masses. Even with cut feet and swollen legs, they remained enthusiastic and persevered to the end. During the flood season, many cadres sent down patrolled the riverbanks day and night, and even when sick, they refused to leave the front line. Li Yannong saw a riverbank breach and immediately jumped into the river to block it with his body. Wang Guimei also twice went into the water to take off her cotton coat to block the breach. The cadres sent down learned the good qualities of cherishing labor from the peasant masses, and their selfless attitude towards labor, in turn, educated the peasants, promoting the transformation of customs and habits in the countryside and raising the red banner of labor being glorious. Wang Aisheng, who was sent down to Guandi, took the lead in digging sludge in the pond in winter, his legs frozen blue. When the masses saw this, without a word, they all took off their shoes and socks and jumped into the pit. Originally, some farmers were not at ease with agricultural production and blindly ran to the cities. Although some elderly people had worked all their lives, they always felt that working in the fields had no future and wanted to find an opportunity for their children to leave production and become cadres. Seeing that the Party sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to eat, live, and work with the peasants, their views changed. People who had blindly flowed into the cities slowly returned. A commune member in Qiliying saw that everyone else had returned from the city, but his son had not yet returned, so he personally went to the city to call his son back. Middle school and high school graduates also expressed their determination, saying: "Even university students are coming down to work, what can I, a middle school student, say? Just watch, I am determined to dedicate my youth to the countryside and build a beautiful hometown." The elderly regarded the cadres sent down as role models for educating their children. An old commune member in Zhaodi, whose son did not like to work, taught his son a lesson, saying: "Didn't you see that ministers and section chiefs have come down to work? You are young and don't work. I think we should let the cadres sent down give you a lesson!" In the past, some grassroots cadres did not pay much attention to participating in labor, and the masses had a lot of complaints about this situation. This spring, the Party called on cadres to plant experimental fields, coupled with the labor training of the cadres sent down, those who did not participate in labor actively participated in labor. The Party Branch Secretary of a production brigade used to sleep late in the morning after a meeting at night and did not go to the fields. After the cadres sent down arrived, they waited for the commune members at his door early every morning to go to the fields together. This Party Branch Secretary never slept late again, and not only went to the fields to work early every morning but also implemented the method of working in the fields. The cadres sent down and grassroots cadres went to work early and returned late, enduring hardship first, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. In the past, Zhao Village Brigade never had more than 300 people attending work, but soon after the cadres sent down arrived, it suddenly increased to 400 people. Even the old accountant who had not worked for many years and the newly married daughter-in-law went to work in the fields as an exception. The Party Branch Secretary of Bao'an Dyke said: "In the past, we couldn't get people to work even with gongs and drums, but now, as soon as the bell rings, everyone is in the fields."
    Several hundred cadres sent down displayed their skills in the cultural and technological revolutions. They actively participated in the agricultural tool reform movement, creating, improving, and popularizing more than 3,000 new agricultural tools. A large proportion of the cadres sent down to Xinxiang were comrades from the First Ministry of Machine Building, and their help to the communes in developing industry was particularly great. With the help of these comrades, with the upsurge of establishing people's communes, in a short half month, every team established a factory, and every commune had machines running. The county developed from the original twenty-eight factories to three thousand and two hundred factories. On the cultural front, they were even more active. In Xinxiang County, they personally established seventy-seven elementary school classes, sixty-three middle school classes, seventy red and expert university classes, and three hundred and seventy-nine literacy classes. Almost every cadre sent down served as a teacher and created many good teaching methods. The masses all said: "It would be difficult to hire such good teachers even with a lot of money." The propaganda work and recreational activities in the countryside have also become more active with the participation of the cadres sent down. They helped set up many clubs, reading groups, cultural work troupes, production bulletins, and so on.
    In Xinxiang County, it is indeed true that wherever there are cadres sent down, the work is advanced. Whenever a task is assigned, the cadres sent down always take the lead, publicize, and help grassroots cadres come up with ideas and make plans, becoming the most active force in the countryside in implementing the Party's policies. For example, Qiliying Commune, where production and other tasks have always been done very well, but the sanitation work was not very outstanding. This year, after the Party issued the call to eliminate the four pests, although the commune Party committee attached great importance to it, some cadres still only cared about production and did not pay attention to sanitation. However, the cadres sent down, on the one hand, publicized, and on the other hand, took action and worked hard, repairing toilets, making latrine covers, painting houses, beautifying walls... The sanitation work in Qiliying quickly achieved remarkable results.
    The cadres sent down not only actively participated in labor and contributed cultural and technical knowledge to the countryside, but also put down their airs and integrated with the masses, establishing a relationship as close as flesh and blood. It is common for the cadres sent down to wash pots and dishes, carry water, grind flour, hold children, and take care of household chores for the masses. The masses also regard the cadres sent down as their most trusted relatives. They always leave the best things in their homes for the cadres sent down to eat. Some comrades go to the fields to work, and the old women quietly put eggs and dry food in their pockets without them knowing. When something happens in the homes of the masses, they also like to consult with the cadres sent down. If there is discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, they ask the cadres sent down to mediate. If they need to weigh grain, record work points, or even write letters to their fiancés, young girls ask the cadres sent down to give advice. The family-like relationship between the cadres sent down and the masses has played a great role in strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. The masses said that the cadres from the land reform period have returned again. The masses also wholeheartedly support the Party's cadre policy. The elderly often say: "It would be a real mistake to hand over the people's country to this group of young people who don't know the difficulties of managing a household. Chairman Mao is so wise to let them come to labor and train them to be both capable in writing and in martial arts. When they go back to work, they will have a better understanding, and the people's country will become as solid as iron." This is the best evaluation of our Party's cadre policy.

    一批移风易俗的战士
    中共新乡县委第一书记  胡少华
    “下放干部真是中，各项工作打冲锋。
    相处劳动一阶段，真是手足亲弟兄。
    在校你是我老师，下地甘当我学生，
    技术革命是神手，宣传时事是先行。
    搞福利讲卫生，还有很多说不清，
    是农民是学生，再有本领难分清。”
    这是小冀镇的农民赞扬下放干部的一首诗。今年，中央机关、河南省和新乡地委机关有七百多干部下放在新乡县进行劳动锻炼。这些同志初来时，大多数人的确是四体不勤，五谷不分，和群众没有共同语言。经过了劳动锻炼，又参加了农村整风和社会主义大辩论等政治运动，他们不但改变了轻视劳动的观点，学会了劳动，提高了政治觉悟，同时也大大地促进了地方工作，小冀镇农民对他们的赞扬并不过分。
    提起下放干部的劳动，社员们总是说：“真破份”（肯干的意思）。在加强棉田管理的时候，第一机械部下放干部王屯大队提出：“不怕天热流尽汗，不怕刮风雷雨天，天热不过晒层皮，流汗不过湿件衣。皮肤愈晒越结实，衣服湿了再洗洗。”水稻插秧运动中，下放干部同群众一起昼夜浸泡在水里，脚划破、腿泡肿，仍然情绪高昂，坚持到底。防汛期间，不少下放干部不分昼夜地在河堤上巡逻，害病也不下火线，李砚农看到河堤决口，立即跳到河里用身子堵住决口。王桂梅也曾两次下水脱下棉袄堵决口。下放干部从农民群众身上学得了热爱劳动的好品质，他们的忘我的劳动态度反回来又教育了农民，在农村中移风易俗，插起了劳动光荣的红旗。下放到关堤的王爱生同志，冬天带头下塘挖污泥，冻的腿青脚紫。群众一见二话不说都脱了鞋袜跳入坑内。原来有些农民不安心农业生产，盲目向城市里跑。有些老人虽然自己劳动终生，可是，总觉得下地干活没前途，想找个机会让自己的子弟脱离生产当干部。一看到党派出大批干部到农村来和农民同吃同住同劳动，看法就有了改变。原来盲目流入城市的人慢慢地都回来了。七里营的一个社员看见别人都从城里回来了，自己的儿子还没有回来，就亲自到城里去把儿子叫回来。中、小学毕业生也都表示决心说：“人家大学生都下来劳动了，我这中学生还有啥说的，请看着吧，坚决把青春献给农村，建设美好的家乡。”老年人把下放干部当成教育子女的榜样。赵堤有一个老社员，儿子不爱劳动，他就教训儿子说：“你就没看见，部长、科长都下来劳动了，你年轻轻的不劳动，我看该让下放干部给你上课啦！”过去，有些基层干部不大注意参加劳动，群众对这种情况很有意见。今年春天，党号召干部种试验田，加上下放干部劳动锻炼，原来不大参加劳动的，都积极参加劳动。有一个生产大队的支部书记，原来晚上一开会，早上就睡大觉不下地。下放干部去后，天天一大早在他门口等社员一齐下地，这位支部书记从此再不睡大觉了，不但天天早上下地劳动，还实行了在田间办公的办法。下放干部和基层干部劳动中早起晚归吃苦在前，对群众的生产积极性是很大的鼓舞。赵村大队过去出勤总是超不过三百人，下放干部去了不久，一下增加到四百人，连长年不下地的老会计和刚过门的新媳妇都破例下地干活。保安堤的支部书记说：“过去敲锣打鼓都请不下地，现在钟声一响，地里的人就齐了。”
    几百名下放干部在文化革命技术革命中大显神通，他们积极参加农具改革运动，创造、改良和推广了三千多件新农具。新乡的下放干部中有很大一部分是第一机械工业部的同志，他们对公社搞工业的帮助尤其大。在这些同志的帮助下，随着建立人民公社的高潮，在短短的半月内，实现了队队建工厂，社社机器响。全县由原来的二十八个工厂发展到三千二百个工厂。在文化战线上，他们更是活跃。在新乡县，他们亲自动手建立起小学七十七班，初中六十三班，红专大学七十班，扫盲三百七十九班，差不多每个下放干部都当了教员，并且创造了很多好的教学方法，群众都说：“花多少钱也难请到这样的好老师。”农村的宣传工作和文娱活动，有了下放干部的参加也更加活跃，他们帮助搞起了很多俱乐部、读报组、文工团、生产快报等等。
    在新乡县的确是哪里有下放干部，哪里的工作就先进。任何一项任务下来，下放干部总是又带头、又宣传、又帮助基层干部出主意订计划，成为农村中贯彻执行党的政策的一支最活跃的力量。比如七里营公社，那里的生产以及其他各项工作一向都搞得很好，就是卫生工作不大出色。今年党发出除四害的号召以后，社党委虽然很重视，有些干部仍然只顾生产不讲卫生。可是，下放干部却一面宣传，一面动手大干起来，修理厕所、作茅坑盖、粉刷房屋、美化墙壁……。七里营的卫生工作很快就搞出显著的成绩。
    下放干部不但积极参加劳动，把文化技术知识贡献给农村，还放下架子同群众打成一片，建立了情同骨肉的关系。下放干部为群众刷锅洗碗、担水、推磨、抱孩子、料理家务已是常事，群众也把下放干部当成自己最可信赖的亲人。他们总是把家里最好的东西留给下放干部吃，有些同志下地干活，老大娘们不知什么时候就悄悄地给口袋里放进去鸡蛋和干粮。群众家里有事，也最爱找下放干部商量，婆媳不和，要请下放干部调解，收粮过秤、记工分要找下放干部代办，甚至年轻姑娘给未婚夫写信也找下放干部当参谋。下放干部和群众亲如家人的关系，对于密切党群关系起了很大作用。群众说这是土改时的干部又回来了。群众也衷心拥护党的这一干部政策。老年人常说：把人民的江山交给这群不当家不知柴米贵的年轻人，真不中。毛主席就是英明，让他们来劳动劳动，锻炼的能文能武，回去再工作，心里就有数了，人民的江山就成了铁打的了。这是对我们党的这一干部政策的最好的评价。
