　　Sea

　　Lamusurong's daughter has brownish-yellow eyes,
　　She takes out colored pencils and paper,
　　Leaning over the high table,
　　Stroke by stroke, she paints her ideal.

　　A large tree grows upwards,
　　Its branches wearing green clothes,
　　Butterflies land on the flowers,
　　A scene of beautiful scenery all around.

　　Squirrels are jumping, the fruits are ripe,
　　Countless flowers of all colors,
　　A rainbow arches across the sky,
　　Children dance happily under the rainbow.

　　Blue rivers flow leisurely,
　　The Gobi is a sea bordering an oasis,
　　Herdsmen drive sheep to the seashore,
　　Fishermen discuss the bountiful harvest.

　　Children ride boats for the first time,
　　Rowing boats and enjoying the waves is so much fun,
　　What white birds are flying in the distance?
　　Those are seagulls spreading their wings.

　　Mother is surprised to see the painting,
　　What did her daughter use as a model for this painting?
　　How can yellow sand become blue water,
　　How can flowers grow in the desert?

　　The happy daughter laughs heartily,
　　How can Mom not know,
　　Transforming the desert into a sea,
　　The Soviet example is really good.

　　Father interjects,
　　What my daughter paints will surely come true,
　　I wonder if we'll be around
　　When the Gobi blooms?

　　Mom, listen to how strange Dad is,
　　We will definitely be here then,
　　I'll become an expert creating the ocean,
　　Renaming the Gobi the Sea of Peace.

    海蒙古  拉姆苏荣女儿眼睛色褐黄，拿来彩笔和纸张，俯在高高桌子上，一笔一笔画理想。一棵大树朝上长，枝儿穿起绿衣裳，鲜花上面落蝴蝶，周围一片好风光。松鼠在跳果已熟，万紫千红花无数，一道彩虹天空架，虹下儿童在欢舞。条条大江蓝悠悠，戈壁是海傍绿洲，牧民赶羊去海滨，渔夫纷纷论丰收。儿童初次乘上船，逐波荡舟真好玩，什么白鸟儿远处飞，那是海鸥把翅展。妈妈看画好惊讶，女儿照啥画这画？黄沙怎能成蓝水，沙漠怎能长鲜花？幸福女儿哈哈笑，妈妈怎能不知道，改造沙漠成大海，苏联榜样实在好。父亲开口插一言，女儿画的必实现，不知戈壁开花时，我们是否在人间？妈妈你听爸多怪，那时我们一定在，我成专家造海洋，戈壁改名和平海。
