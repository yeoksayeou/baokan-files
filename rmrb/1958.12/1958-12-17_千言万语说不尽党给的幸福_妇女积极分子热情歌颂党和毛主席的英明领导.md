Xinhua News Agency, 16th: In the final day's speeches at the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, the representatives unanimously praised the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and expressed their gratitude for the happy and beautiful life the Party has given them. They all expressed their determination to always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and follow the Party.

"It was the Party that sent me to be an apprentice, it was the Party that constantly encouraged me to study hard, it was the Party that cultivated me from a housewife into a female worker, the benefits the Communist Party has given me are endless." This is what Huang Xuefang, a female worker from the Shenghua Sulfur Factory in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province, said in her speech today. Huang Xuefang is twenty-three years old this year, born into a poor peasant family. After liberation, she participated in street work and became a street activist. After the Party put forward the general line for socialist construction, the street Party organization sent her to the sulfur factory as an apprentice. After entering the factory, she was a little scared, afraid that her education was low and she would not learn well. The Party branch secretary of the sulfur factory, knowing her situation, often talked to her and encouraged her. When she made achievements, the Party branch praised her. When she was transferred to work at the No. 2 furnace in the sulfur factory, the output of this furnace had never exceeded fifty to seventy kilograms, making it the most backward furnace in the entire factory. At that time, the Party branch secretary encouraged her to find ways to increase production. She followed the Party branch secretary's advice, and worked hard with the master to improve four operating methods, increasing the furnace output to 460 kilograms, creating a new record for the entire factory. Huang Xuefang said in her speech today that thanks to the Party's cultivation and the help of comrades, I have become a fourth-grade worker, and the Zunyi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also given me the honorary title of "Young Worker Pacesetter." I guarantee that I will listen to the Party's words in the future, and go wherever there are difficulties to fight, in order to repay the Party's kindness to me.

Wei Fengying, a female worker from the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, said at the meeting with gratitude, the little achievements I have made are mainly due to the Party's education and cultivation of me. Wei Fengying entered the factory in 1953. When she started mastering machines for production, she could not keep up with the progress and also produced defective products. One of the reasons was that the products she produced were mixed with powder, and it took a lot of time to pick them out. Therefore, she thought about using a spring automatic switch car and grinding the knife into an angle to separate the product from the powder, to solve the problems in production. She told the Party branch about her ideas, and the Party branch encouraged her and invited experienced masters and technicians to help her research and experiment. Finally, the machine was successfully improved, reversing the situation of not being able to complete the task and completing the annual production target 118 days ahead of schedule. Wei Fengying said: This incident gave me a very profound education. Improving tools cannot be done by relying on individual strength alone, but must be reported to the Party and obtain the Party's leadership and the help of comrades. Later, in many inventions and creations, she took the initiative to consult the Party and seek help from comrades. When she failed in the experiment, the Party encouraged her; when she succeeded in the experiment, the Party told her not to be arrogant. In 1956, in order to cultivate her, the Party sent her to a technical school to study, which improved her production skills and enabled her to have better conditions for invention and creation. In the past few years, she has put forward a total of ninety-five innovation projects, creating a wealth of 450,000 yuan for the country. She said at the end of her speech: The above-mentioned achievements I have made should first of all be attributed to the Party and the collective strength. In the future, I am determined to learn modestly, study hard, and constantly improve my political consciousness and technical level under the leadership of the Party, without being proud or arrogant.

Chen Zhiying, one of the first female aviators in New China who grew up under the cultivation of the Party, deeply expressed her infinite gratitude to the Party in her speech. It was the Party's meticulous care and cultivation that made her a soldier of the People's Air Force from a rural girl. Before liberation, Chen Zhiying was a rural girl in the suburbs of Shanghai, who had only attended elementary school for three years. After liberation, she joined the People's Liberation Army. In 1951, the Party sent her to aviation school for training. At the beginning, there were many difficulties, her education level was low and her physical strength was poor, but under the education of the Party and the patient help of the instructors, she finally overcame the difficulties, mastered aviation technology and learned to fly. For eight years, Chen Zhiying has been successfully completing various flight missions, with a flight time of nearly 1,500 hours or more, and completing a journey of 500,000 kilometers. Now Chen Zhiying is the deputy battalion commander of a certain unit of the Air Force and is training the second batch of female aviators for the motherland.

It is the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao that has enabled women who suffered endlessly in the old society to obtain a beautiful and happy life. This beautiful life has promoted them to muster greater enthusiasm and work selflessly for the cause of the Party. When building the Dongliang Canal in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, four young girls conquered a mud pit with amazing energy. This mud pit was more than thirty meters long, with several feet of frozen ice and mud inside. To allow the flood to flow through there, it had to be leveled. At first, no one wanted to accept this arduous task, but the Hui girl Ma Hamai took the lead and other three girls volunteered to request that this section of the project be handed over to them. After three days and nights of hard work, they finally leveled the pit. When Ma Hamai talked about what force prompted her to accept this task at the meeting, she said, I thought at that time that before liberation, our family of six had nothing to eat or wear, and slept crowded on a kang at night, without even a quilt to cover ourselves. For the sake of survival, the whole family had to leave our hometown and flee famine outside. It was not until after liberation that we returned to our hometown and were allocated twelve mu of land, and our lives became better and better after collectivization. Now the Party and the government are calling on the people to build canals, divert water to the mountains, change the arid appearance, and improve people's lives. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao was endless, and an unstoppable force urged me to do it. With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I am not afraid of any difficulties.

The Party's leadership has opened the door of science to rural women, turning them from farmers into scientific researchers. The Nongfeng People's Commune in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, established an agricultural science research institute this year. The deputy director of this research institute is a woman named Zhao Shuqing, who reported at the meeting today on the results of her and three female companions' research on seed breeding. They once used Xanthium sibiricum to graft soybeans, and the oil content was higher than ordinary soybeans. She said that they will also experiment with grafting castor beans and soybeans, corn and sorghum, zucchini and eggplants next year, promote the use of potato sprouts and potato skins to grow potatoes, and continue to cultivate the second generation of Xanthium sibiricum grafted soybeans. Li Shumei, director of the Women's Federation of Dali County, Shaanxi Province, introduced to everyone that 2,221 "female champions," "female Zhuge Liangs," and female experts have emerged among the women of Dali County in the technical revolution movement. 133 ball bearing factories have been established in the county, and one-third of them are female workers. Within a month, they produced more than 420,000 ball bearings.

Among the representatives who spoke today, there were also many who learned multiple skills under the guidance of the Party and created extraordinary achievements in production. There is Wang Xiuying, the captain of the "Women's No. 1" fishing boat driven by twenty-one women from the Waisha Fishery Cooperative in Beihai City, Guangdong Province. The fishing boat she led went to sea three times, and the first time it caught more than 22,000 catties of fish, creating the highest output record for fishing boats in the city at that time. There is also Wu Shuhua, the political instructor of the "March 8th" drilling team in Karamay. Their drilling team, organized by 35 family members, drilled 22 oil wells in less than three months, with oil coming out of every well, and the drilling progress exceeded the national plan every month. There is Li Shuqin, the furnace chief of the "Liu Hulan No. 1" earthen blast furnace of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Macheng County, Hubei Province. Their 0.4 cubic meter iron-smelting furnace is a high-yield and long-life furnace, which once produced 27,000 catties of iron in one day and night, and has been able to produce iron normally and evenly on time since late September. There is also Chu Wenzhen, the platoon leader of the first platoon of the "Cotton and Grain Satellite Assault Regiment" of the Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, who created a high cotton yield record.

Song Yingjie, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Shangzhuang People's Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, mainly talked about their experience in leading and organizing the masses' lives in her speech today. Song Yingjie said that Chairman Mao had inspected their work there in August this year. Chairman Mao's deep concern for the lives of the masses gave them great inspiration and education. Since then, their Party committee has made great efforts in leading the work of running canteens well. All the more than 300 canteens in the commune have established dining halls, achieving diversification of meals, and each canteen is equipped with insulated baskets and insulated jars to allow members to eat hot meals. The canteens also have small shops to sell side dishes and wine on behalf of others, and special care is also given to the sick and lying-in women. Song Yingjie said that they have included running mass collective welfare undertakings well on the agenda of the Party committee, and while inspecting production, they also inspect how well the organization of the masses' lives is done. They emphasized that all cadres have the task of running canteens well. Only producing well is not enough. If the lives of the masses are not well organized, they will not get the red flag. This makes running canteens well a matter of everyone's concern.

Zhang Xiuqin, a teacher from Guoji Agricultural Middle School in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, and He Huiqin, the eldest sister of the "Frontier Ten Sisters," a female militia on the Fujian front line, also spoke at the conference today.

From the 5th to the 16th, a total of 167 representatives spoke at the conference, plus more than 470 people who made written speeches. They unanimously expressed their support for Comrade Peng Dehuai's speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Cai Chang's report of the All-China Women's Federation, and are willing to work hard to implement them in future work.

At today's conference, Li Dequan, Minister of Health and Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, reported to the representatives on the national campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

    千言万语说不尽党给的幸福
    妇女积极分子热情歌颂党和毛主席的英明领导
    新华社16日讯  全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议最后一天的发言中，代表们异口同声地歌颂党和毛主席的英明正确的领导，感激党所给予她们的幸福美好的生活。她们纷纷表示决心，要永远听党和毛主席的话，跟着党走。
    “是党送我去当学徒工，是党不断地鼓励我要好好学习，是党培养我由一个家庭妇女成为一个女工，共产党给我的好处说也说不完。”这是贵州省遵义市升华硫磺厂女工黄学芳今天在发言中说的话。黄学芳今年二十三岁，出生贫农家庭，解放后参加街道工作，成为街道积极分子，党提出社会主义建设总路线以后，街道党组织就把她送到硫磺厂当学徒工。她进厂后，心里有点害怕，怕自己文化低，学不好。硫磺厂的党支部书记知道她的情况后，经常找她谈话，鼓励她，有了成绩，党支部就表扬她。她在硫磺厂被调到二号炉工作时，这个炉子的产量始终没有超过五十公斤到七十公斤，是全厂最落后的一个炉子。当时，党支部书记就鼓励她想办法提高产量。她遵照党支书的意见，和师傅一起，刻苦钻研，改进了四项操作法，使炉子产量提高到四百六十公斤，创造了全厂新纪录。黄学芳今天在发言中说，由于党的培养和同志们的帮助，我已成为四级工，中共遵义市委还给了我“青工标兵”的光荣称号。我今后保证听党的话，哪里有困难，就到哪里去战斗，以报答党给我的恩情。
    辽宁省沈阳东北机器制造厂女工尉凤英怀着感激的心情在会上说，我取得的一点成绩，主要是由于党对我的教育和培养。尉凤英1953年入厂，她开始掌握机器进行生产时，赶不上进度，还出废品。原因之一是她生产出来的产品和末子混在一起，拣一遍要费很多时间。于是，她就琢磨着想用弹簧自动开关车和把刀磨成角度，使产品和末子分开的办法，解决生产中的问题。她向党支部说出了她的想法，党支部鼓励她，并请了老师傅和技术员帮助她研究和试验，终于把机器改进成功了，扭转了完不成任务的情况，提前一百一十八天完成了全年的生产指标。尉凤英说：这件事给我很深刻的教育，改进工具光靠个人的力量是不成的，必须请示党，取得党的领导和同志们的帮助。以后，她在多次的发明创造中，都主动请示党和找同志们帮助。当她试验失败的时候，党就鼓励她；当她试验成功的时候，党就叫她不要骄傲。1956年，党为了培养她，把她送到技术学校去学习，提高了她的生产本领，使她有更好的条件进行发明创造。几年来，她共提出了九十五项革新项目，为国家创造了四十五万元的财富。她在发言中最后说：我取得上述一点成绩，首先应归功于党和集体力量。今后我有决心在党的领导下，不骄不傲，虚心学习，努力钻研，不断地提高政治觉悟和技术水平。
    在党的培养下成长起来的新中国第一批女航空员中的一名驾驶员陈志英在发言时深深地表示她对党的无限感激。是党的无微不至的关怀和培养，使她由一个农村姑娘成为人民空军战士。解放前，陈志英是上海郊区的一个农村姑娘，只上过三年小学，解放后她参加了人民解放军，1951年，党送她到航空学校培养。开始时有许多困难，文化水平低，体力又差，但是在党的教育和教员的耐心帮助下终于战胜了困难，掌握了航空技术，学会了飞行。八年来，陈志英一直出色地完成各项飞行任务，飞行时间将近一千五百小时以上，完成五十万公里的航程。现在陈志英已经是空军某部的副大队长，正在培养祖国第二批女航空员。
    有了共产党和毛主席的领导，才使旧社会受尽折磨的妇女们获得了美好幸福的生活。这种美好的生活又促进她们鼓起更大的干劲，为党的事业而忘我地劳动。在修建甘肃临夏回族自治州境内的东梁渠时，有四个年青的姑娘以惊人的干劲征服了一个烂泥坑。这个烂泥坑有三十多公尺长，里面是几尺深的冻冰和泥浆，要使洪水流过那里，就必须垫平它。起初谁都不愿接受这个艰巨任务，但是回族姑娘马哈麦却带头和其他三个姑娘自告奋勇地提出请求，把这段工程交给她们，经过三昼夜苦战终于垫平了这个坑。当马哈麦在会上谈起是什么力量促使她接受这个任务时，她说，我当时想到解放前我们一家六口人没吃没穿，晚上挤在一个炕上，身上还没有盖的。为了生活，全家只好背井离乡，在外逃荒。解放后才回到家乡分到了十二亩土地，合作化后生活越过越好了。现在党和政府又号召人民修水渠，引水上山，改变干旱面貌，改善人民生活。我越想越觉得党和毛主席的恩情说不完，于是一股不可阻挡的力量催促着我去干。有了党和毛主席的领导，我是什么困难都不怕的。
    党的领导使农村妇女们打开了科学的大门，从庄稼人变成了科学研究工作者。黑龙江省双城县农丰人民公社今年成立了一所农业科学研究室，这个研究室的副主任是一个叫做赵淑青的妇女，她今天在会上报告了她和三名女伴研究种籽繁育的成果。她们曾经用苍子嫁接大豆，含油量比普通大豆要高。她说，她们明年还要试验蓖麻和大豆、玉米和高粱、西葫芦和茄子等植物的嫁接，推广用土豆芽、土豆皮种土豆的办法，还要继续培养苍子嫁接大豆的第二代。陕西省大荔县的妇联主任李淑梅向大家介绍大荔县妇女在技术革命运动中涌现出“女状元”、“女诸葛”、女能手二千零二十一名。全县建立了一百三十三个滚珠轴承厂，有三分之一是女工，一个月内，她们就制出滚珠四十二万多颗。
    在今天发言的代表中，还有许多是由于党的指引而学会了多样本领在生产上创立了奇功的人。这里有广东省北海市外沙渔业社由二十一名妇女驾驶的“妇女一号”渔船的船长王秀英，她所领导的这只渔船曾经三次出海，第一次就捕鱼二万二千多斤，创造了当时全市渔船最高产量纪录。这里还有克拉玛依“三八”钻井队的政治指导员吴淑华，她们这个由三十五名家属组织起来的钻井队，在不到三个月的时间内钻了二十二口油井，井井出油，钻井进度月月超额完成国家计划。这里有湖北省麻城县东风人民公社“刘胡兰一号”土高炉的炉长李淑琴，她们这个○·四立米的炼铁炉是一个高产长寿炉，曾经在一昼夜内产铁二万七千斤，从9月下旬以来，一直能够正常均衡地按时出铁。这里还有山东省高唐县宏伟人民公社“棉粮卫星突击团”第一排的排长储文珍，她们创造了棉花的高产纪录。
    河北省徐水县商庄人民公社党委副书记宋英杰今天发言的内容，主要谈的是他们领导和组织群众生活问题的经验。宋英杰说，今年8月，毛主席曾经到那里视察工作，毛主席对群众生活的深切关怀，给了他们很大的启示和教育。从那时以后，他们的党委在领导办好食堂的工作中作了很大的努力。全社三百多个食堂，都设立了饭厅，做到饭菜多样化，各个食堂都备有暖篓和暖缸，使社员们吃到热饭，食堂还设有小卖部，代卖小菜和酒，对于病人和产妇也有特殊的照顾。宋英杰说，他们把办好群众集体福利事业列入到党委的议事日程，在检查生产的同时，也检查组织群众生活做得怎样。并强调所有干部都有办好食堂的任务，只是生产好，群众生活搞不好，同样得不到红旗，这样就使办好食堂成为人人关心的工作。
    今天在大会上发言的还有江苏省铜山县郭集农业中学教师张秀琴、福建前线女民兵“前沿十姐妹”的大姐何惠琴。
    从5日到16日，在大会上发言的代表共有一百六十七人，加上书面发言的共有四百七十多人。她们一致表示拥护彭德怀同志代表中共中央的讲话和全国妇联蔡畅主席的报告，并愿在今后工作中努力贯彻执行。
    在今天的大会上，卫生部部长、全国妇女联合会副主席李德全向代表们报告了全国开展除四害讲卫生运动的情况。
