The Demands of the Cypriot People Cannot Be Ignored
Commentator of this newspaper

    On December 6, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution that seriously ignores the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination and independence. This proposal was put forward by Mexico, and it only vaguely stated: "Believes that the parties concerned will continue to work hard to achieve a peaceful, democratic and fair solution that conforms to the Charter of the United Nations." Thus, the Cyprus issue, which the UN General Assembly's Political Committee debated for eight days, failed to make any progress, just like at the previous UN General Assembly.
    It is clear that Cyprus belongs to the Cypriot people, and the Cyprus issue should be resolved in accordance with the interests of the Cypriot people. However, the UN General Assembly has failed to find a reasonable solution based on the Cypriot people's desire for self-determination and independence in several discussions on the Cyprus issue, entirely due to the deliberate sabotage and obstruction by Britain and other Western colonial countries.
    Since the last session of the UN General Assembly discussed the Cyprus issue, Britain has paid even less attention to the Cypriot people's legitimate desire for self-determination and independence, and has successively put forward deceptive plans such as "ten years of autonomy" and "seven years of partnership" to impose on the Cypriot people. This has of course been resolutely rejected and opposed by the Cypriot people. The Cypriot people's struggle for self-determination and independence has become increasingly courageous, and British colonialists have adopted bloody means in an attempt to suppress the Cypriot people's independence movement, turning Cyprus into an island of terror. From the perspective of international justice or international security, the Cyprus issue has reached a point where a reasonable solution is urgently needed. However, the current UN General Assembly has failed to fulfill its due responsibility and only passed a vague resolution, which will obviously only arouse the Cypriot people's more determined fighting will.
    In the UN General Assembly's discussion on the Cyprus issue, Britain clearly stated that it has no intention of giving up its colonial rule over Cyprus, whether now or in the future. Britain is clinging to Cyprus in order to use Cyprus as a military base for its continued aggression against Middle Eastern Arab countries. Historically, almost all British aggressions against Middle Eastern Arab countries have started from British military bases in Cyprus. Especially after British troops were forced to withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone in Egypt in 1954, Britain concentrated a large number of troops here and intensified its control over Cyprus. The 1956 British war of aggression against Egypt's Suez Canal used Cyprus as its base of attack. When Britain invaded Jordan this summer, it also used Cyprus as its stepping stone. Today, the national independence movement in the Middle East is flourishing, and Britain, fearing the loss of the oil resources it has plundered in the region, is even more trying to firmly grasp Cyprus as a military base for its suppression of the Middle Eastern national independence movement.
    In the UN General Assembly's discussion on the Cyprus issue, Britain dares to continue to play tricks on the Cyprus issue and adopt a stance hostile to the people of Middle Eastern Arab countries, which is inseparable from the support of the United States. During the discussion, the United States was fundamentally unwilling to see a fair solution to the Cyprus issue, and openly declared that the United Nations was not the place to solve the Cyprus issue, and tried its best to advocate solving the problem "under the protection of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The United States wants to pull the Cyprus issue into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with itself as the leader, to solve it, in order to get involved and turn Cyprus, which has always been exclusively occupied by Britain, into a common aggression base occupied by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    However, no matter what the British and American aggressors plan, the Cypriot people's demand for self-determination and independence is unstoppable. The heroic Cypriot people have fought for a long time and paid a heavy price for national self-determination and independence. They have a firm fighting will and rich fighting experience. Their just struggle will surely win in the end, and their desire for self-determination and independence will be realized.

    塞浦路斯人民的要求不容忽视
    本报评论员
    12月6日，联合国大会通过了一项严重忽视塞浦路斯人民要求自决和独立的愿望的决议案。这项提案是墨西哥提出的，它仅仅含糊其词地表示：“相信有关方面将继续努力，以便取得符合于联合国宪章的和平、民主、公正的解决办法。”这样，联大政治委员会辩论了八天之久的塞浦路斯问题，像在上届联合国大会一样，又没有取得任何进展。
    塞浦路斯是塞浦路斯人民的，塞浦路斯问题应当根据塞浦路斯人民的利益来解决，这本来是十分清楚的事。然而，联合国大会几次讨论塞浦路斯问题，都未能根据塞浦路斯人民要求自决和独立的愿望求得合理解决，完全是由于英国和其它西方殖民国家蓄意破坏和阻挠。
    自从上届联大讨论塞浦路斯问题以来，英国对塞浦路斯人民要求自决和独立的合理愿望更加置之不顾，先后提出什么“十年自治”、
  “七年合伙”等骗人的计划，要强加于塞浦路斯人民的头上，这当然遭到塞浦路斯人民的坚决拒绝和反对，塞浦路斯人民争取自决和独立的斗争愈来愈勇猛，英国殖民者就采取了血腥的手段，企图镇压塞浦路斯人民的独立运动，使塞浦路斯成为一个恐怖之岛。不论从国际正义或者国际安全的角度来说，塞浦路斯问题都已经是到了迫切需要合理解决的时候了。但是本届联合国大会竟没有负起它应有的责任，只通过了一个空洞的决议，这显然只会激起塞浦路斯人民更坚决的斗争意志。
    在这次联大关于塞浦路斯问题的讨论中，英国明白表示它不论现在和将来，都不打算放弃对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。英国死抓住塞浦路斯不放，是要把塞浦路斯作为它对中东阿拉伯国家继续进行侵略的军事基地。英国历来对中东阿拉伯国家的侵略，几乎没有不是从塞浦路斯的英国军事基地出发的。特别是1954年英国军队被迫撤出埃及的苏伊士运河区以后，英国在这里集中大量军队，加紧了对塞浦路斯的控制。1956年英国侵略埃及苏伊士运河的战争，就是把塞浦路斯作为它的进攻基地。今年夏天，英国侵略约旦的时候，也是以塞浦路斯作为它的踏脚石。今天中东地区的民族独立运动正蓬勃发展，英国唯恐失掉它在这个地区所掠夺到的石油资源，更企图牢牢地抓住塞浦路斯，作为它镇压中东民族独立运动的军事侵略基地。
    在联大这次关于塞浦路斯问题的讨论中，英国敢于继续在塞浦路斯问题上玩弄阴谋，采取与中东阿拉伯国家人民为敌的态度，是同美国对它的支持分不开的。在讨论中，美国根本不愿意使塞浦路斯问题获得公正的解决，并公然宣称联合国不是解决塞浦路斯问题的地方，竭力主张“在北大西洋公约组织的保护下”去解决这个问题。美国要把塞浦路斯问题拉到以它自己为盟主的北大西洋公约集团去解决，是想从中插一手，把一向由英国独占的塞浦路斯变成北大西洋公约集团共同占有的侵略基地。
    然而，不管英国和美国侵略者作何打算，塞浦路斯人民的自决和独立的要求是不可遏止的。英勇的塞浦路斯人民，为了争取民族的自决和独立，已经作了长期的斗争，付出过重大的代价，他们有着坚定的斗争意志和丰富的斗争经验，他们的正义斗争最后一定能够胜利，他们要求自决和独立的愿望必将实现。
