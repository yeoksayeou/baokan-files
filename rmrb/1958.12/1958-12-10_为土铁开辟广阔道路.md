    Open up a broad road for native iron
    In the mass movement for iron and steelmaking, the masses built a large number of native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces, producing millions of tons of native iron. How to give full play to the due role of these native iron, this is a completely new issue for us.
    The basic characteristic of native iron in terms of chemical composition is that the sulfur content is very high, generally around 1%, and some are as high as 3% or more, while the content of carbon, silicon, and manganese are all low. According to the usual method of treating foreign pig iron, the machine parts cast would turn into white cast iron, which is hard and brittle, making it impossible to cut and process.
    The Machinery Manufacturing and Process Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, in conjunction with Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Factory, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Tsinghua University and other units, combined production practice and carried out collaborative research and experiments, making use of the high sulfur content of native iron, transforming sulfur from a harmful factor into a beneficial factor. They used native iron to cast "native" ductile iron, making sulfur promote graphite spheroidization in the manufacturing process of "native" ductile iron, equivalent to the role of magnesium in "foreign" ductile iron. The mechanical properties of "native" ductile iron are much higher than that of gray cast iron cast from foreign pig iron. Compared with "foreign" ductile iron, although it is slightly worse, it does not require the addition of spheroidizing agents, saving the consumption of magnesium, a metal that is still relatively scarce in our country, which is more conducive to universal promotion. In the past, the sulfur in native iron, which was always considered difficult to handle, has now been tamed in front of us. We can remove it if we want, and use it if we want: we can use native iron to manufacture general gray iron castings, or we can cast high-grade castings with properties close to steel. This further solves the problem of replacing steel with native iron for making machine parts.
    One of the main contradictions facing China's machinery industry is the difficulty in the supply of raw materials and blanks, especially the supply of cast pig iron is very tight. Castings in mechanical products generally account for about 70% of the total weight of the machine itself. The creation of native ductile iron is of great significance for continuously supplying cast pig iron and making qualified castings, ensuring the high-speed development of the machinery industry. Although these experiences are currently in the initial stage, and there are many theoretical and practical issues to be further explored and resolved, from the perspective of technical maturity, it already has the conditions for universal promotion. In the promotion work, we must widely absorb the creations of the masses, enrich the existing experience, and systematically master the laws of using native iron for casting, so that China's native iron will open up a broad road for machinery manufacturing.

    为土铁开辟广阔道路
    在全民炼铁炼钢运动中，群众兴办了大量的土高炉、小高炉，生产出数百万吨的土铁。如何发挥这些土铁应有的作用，这对我们来说是个全新的问题。
    土铁在化学成份上的基本特点是含硫量非常高，一般都在百分之一左右，有的高达3％以上，而碳、硅、锰的含量都较低，按照通常处理洋生铁的办法，铸出的机器零件，就变成白口铸铁，发硬发脆，没法进行切削加工。
    第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺研究院先后和北京第一通用机械厂、北京农业机械厂、清华大学等单位结合生产实践，协同研究和试验，利用了土铁中含硫量高的特点，把硫由有害因素转化为有利因素，用土铁铸出了“土”球墨铸铁，使硫在“土”球墨铸铁的制造过程中，促成石墨球化，相当于“洋”球墨铸铁中镁的作用。“土”球墨铸铁的机械性能比用洋生铁铸出的灰口铁要高得多，和“洋”球墨铸铁相比，虽然稍差一些，但由于不需要另加球化剂，节约了我国当前还比较稀缺的金属——镁的消耗，更有利于普遍推广。过去，一向认为难以处理的土铁中的硫，现在，在我们面前驯服了。我们要脱就脱，要用就用：我们可以用土铁制造一般的灰口铸铁件，也可以铸成性能接近于钢的高级铸件。这就进一步解决了以土铁代替钢材做机件的问题。
    我国机械工业面临的主要矛盾之一，是原材料和毛胚供应的困难，尤其是铸造生铁的供应显得十分紧张。机械产品中的铸件，一般约占机械本身总重量的70％左右。土球墨铸铁的创制，对于源源不断地供应铸造生铁和作出合乎要求的铸件，保证机械工业高速度发展有着重大的意义。虽然这些经验目前还处于初级阶段，有许多理论和实践上的问题有待于进一步的探讨和解决，但是从技术成熟程度上来看，已经具备了普遍推广的条件。在推广工作中，广泛地吸取群众的创造，丰富已有的经验，系统地掌握土铁用于铸造的规律，那么，我国的土铁将为机械制造开辟一条宽阔的道路。
