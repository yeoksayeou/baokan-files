Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, December 16th. The evening newspaper "Al-Sharq" published an editorial today supporting the Iraqi people's strong opposition to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree, and also demanded: "Rountree, get out!"

    The editorial pointed out that the Iraqi people are in complete agreement with other Arab peoples in dealing with this issue.

    The newspaper pointed out that the voices and slogans Rountree heard from the people's demonstrations in Baghdad convincingly show that the Arab people from the ocean to the Gulf have awakened and demand national liberation. They have the right to "publicly say good things about good people and bad things about bad people" based on everyone's actions.

    The newspaper further pointed out that the U.S. government "uses money, weapons and other means to participate in and support every imperialist aggression against the great Arab people who are struggling to get rid of the shackles of imperialism."

    伊拉克人民呼声引起共鸣
    黎巴嫩舆论要朗特里滚蛋
    新华社贝鲁特16日电  晚报“东方报”今天发表社论支持伊拉克人民激烈反对美国助理国务卿朗特里的态度，并且也要求：“朗特里滚回去！”
    社论指出，在对待这一问题上，伊拉克人民同其他阿拉伯人民完全一致。
    这家报纸指出，朗特里从巴格达人民的游行示威中所听到的呼声和口号令人信服地表明，从大洋到海湾的阿拉伯人民已经觉醒并且要求民族解放。他们有权根据每一个人的行为“公开地对好人说他好，对坏人说他坏”。
    这家报纸进一步指出，美国政府“用金钱、武器和其他手段来参与和支持帝国主义每一次对正在为摆脱帝国主义的桎梏而进行斗争的伟大的阿拉伯人民的侵略活动。”
