    Two Different Methods
    Zeng Zhi
    There are two different methods for any work: one is the method of more, faster, better, and more economical results; the other is the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. Different methods lead to different results, and the same applies to developing sideline production. In the same commune, some vigorously develop sideline production, greatly increasing cash income, and achieving a simultaneous leap forward in industry, agriculture, and sideline production; others only manage to improve agricultural production, and sideline production fails to take off. Within the same commune or county, sideline production income is very low in the first three quarters of the year, but in the fourth quarter, in just a few days or tens of days, sideline production income reaches tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even over a million yuan.
    Whether or not the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results can be achieved depends on whether the leadership has liberated its thinking and whether it has established the view of mobilizing and relying on the masses. If the leadership's thinking is liberated and politics takes command, it can see further and more comprehensively, see the relationship between diversified operations, sideline production, and the development of industry and agriculture, and see the impact of diverse economies on the country and the lives of commune members. With a clear understanding and a broad vision, one will not be bound by arguments such as "the weather is cold, and there are few opportunities"; "there is a lot of work, heavy tasks, and a shortage of labor, so there is no way to engage in sideline production"; "taking care of this will inevitably lead to the neglect of that, and engaging in sideline production will affect industrial and agricultural production," etc. Instead, one will actively look for opportunities and get to work.
    There are two methods of finding and doing: relying on a few cadres or only relying on a few activists to find and do, or boldly mobilizing the masses and relying on the broad masses to find and do? To find more and do better, it is clear that relying on a few people is not possible. Because the wisdom and strength of a few people are not as great as those of the majority, no matter how hard you try, the effect is not as good as having the majority find and do it. "Many hands make light work." As long as the masses are boldly mobilized and the majority are relied upon to find and do, the opportunities will surely become wider and more numerous, sideline production will surely be done well, and income will surely be high. The Wengjiang Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, originally had three fears about developing diversified operations: first, fear of squeezing out agriculture; second, fear of spending a lot of work for little income; and third, fear that labor would not be able to cope. The commune's Party committee led all cadres and commune members to investigate the leadership's drive and dedication, investigate the opportunities for diverse economies, and investigate the arrangement of labor and the exploitation of labor potential; calculate the needs for production funds, the needs for commune members' lives, and the sources of funds, liberating their thinking and unifying their understanding. On this basis, they mobilized everyone to think of ways and find opportunities, and found a total of fifty-four opportunities such as charcoal burning, winemaking, papermaking, and chopping hoe handles. Then, according to different projects, they rationally arranged labor and formed various specialized teams to engage in sideline production, and immediately took action. In just twenty-five days, they earned 310,000 yuan in cash. Changning County, Yunnan Province, mobilized the masses to discuss developing diversified operations and, after arranging labor in a way that suited local conditions, the production of diverse economies also developed rapidly.
    All people's communes, when developing diversified operations, should undoubtedly adopt the method of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    两种不同的方法
    曾志
    任何工作都有两种不同的方法：一种是多快好省的方法；另一种是少慢差费的方法。方法不同，结果也就不同，开展副业生产也是这样。同样是一个公社，有的大搞副业生产，大增现金收入，做到工、农、副业齐跃进；有的只搞好了农业生产，副业生产开展不起来。同是一个公社或者一个县，今年前三季度副业生产收入很少，第四季度仅仅几天、几十天工夫，副业生产收入就达几万，几十万甚至百万元以上。
    能不能实现多快好省的方针，决定于领导上是不是解放了思想？是不是树立了发动群众、依靠群众的观点？领导思想解放了，政治也挂了帅，就能够看的远看的全，就能够看到多种经营、副业生产和工、农业生产发展的关系，就能够看到多种经济对国家和社员生活的影响。认识清楚，目光远大，也就不会为“天寒地冻，门路很少”；“工作多，任务重，劳力紧张，没办法搞副业”；“顾此必然失彼，搞了副业就要影响工农业生产”等等论调捆住手脚，就会积极去找门路去干。
    去找去干有两种方法，是依靠少数干部或者只是依靠少数积极分子去找去干，还是放手发动群众、依靠广大群众去找去干？要想找得多干得好，显然，依靠少数人是办不到的。因为少数人的智慧、力量都不及多数人，任你如何努力，效果也不如多数人去找去干的好。“人多力量大”，只要放手发动群众，依靠多数人去找去干，门路定会愈来愈广愈多，副业生产定会搞得很好，收入定会很多。湖南平江县瓮江公社，原来对开展多种经营有三怕思想：一怕挤掉农业，二怕花工多收入少，三怕劳力搞不赢。公社党委就领导全体干部社员开展了查领导的干劲和钻劲，查多种经济的门路，查劳力安排和劳力潜力的挖掘；算生产资金需要账，算社员生活需要账，算资金来源账，解放了思想，统一了认识。在此基础上又发动大家想办法、找门路，共找出烧炭、酿酒、做纸、砍锄头把等五十四个门路。然后根据不同项目，合理安排劳力，组成了搞副业的各种专业队，立即行动起来。仅仅二十五天的时间，就收入现金三十一万元。云南昌宁县发动群众讨论开展多种经营，采取因地制宜的办法安排好劳力之后，多种经济生产也得到了迅速发展。
    一切人民公社在开展多种经营时，无疑问的都应当采用多快好省的方法。
