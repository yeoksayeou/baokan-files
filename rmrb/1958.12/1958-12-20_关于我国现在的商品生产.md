    On Commodity Production in Our Country Today
    Hu Sheng
    Since the capitalist ownership of the means of production no longer exists in our country, capitalist commodity production has also been eliminated in our country. What exists in our country today is socialist commodity production based on socialist ownership by the whole people and socialist collective ownership.

    The various social conditions under the socialist system ensure that socialist commodity production must exist and develop. Commodity production will only naturally disappear when these social conditions disappear. It is completely wrong to think that our country does not need commodity production now and that commodities and currency can be eliminated. Our country not only needs commodity production now, but also needs to greatly develop commodity production, of course, developing socialist commodity production, not capitalist commodity production.

    Regarding commodity production under the socialist system, there are many issues worth studying in practice and in theory. Here, I will only tentatively discuss a few issues regarding commodity production in our country today.

    People's communes have both the possibility and the necessity to develop commodity production. In the future, there will be great development in commodity circulation between the state and communes, and between communes. This is a result of the development of production in the people's communes, and it will in turn promote the development of production in the communes and the improvement of the living standards of the members.

    What impact will the rural people's communes have on commodity production in our country? Is it possible to "abolish" commodity production because we have people's communes?

    Some people regard the people's commune as a self-sufficient economic unit, or believe that it should develop in this direction. According to this view, since the products of 500 million peasants have been withdrawn from the scope of commodity exchange, it will of course greatly reduce commodity production in our country, to the point of being able to eliminate it. This view is inconsistent with the facts. The people's commune has the characteristic of being "large" (much larger than the original agricultural cooperatives), and it can engage in diversified operations, combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and also combining industry and agriculture. But it is impossible to imagine that the people's commune can produce all the means of production and means of subsistence it needs. Now, in order to further develop production, each people's commune will consider adding tractors, automobiles, and various machines. The more production develops, the more it needs these things, and it is impossible for it to produce all of them by itself. With the development of production in the commune, the living standards of the members will also gradually improve, and their needs in material and cultural life will become more complex. These needs cannot be fully met by the commune's own production. If the commune is satisfied with the means of production and means of subsistence it can manufacture itself, it will inevitably hinder the development of production and the improvement of living standards. If the commune insists on producing everything it needs, regardless of the limitations of resources and technical conditions, it will only result in the waste of manpower and materials. At the same time, it cannot be assumed that a commune will not produce something simply because it does not need it itself. Each commune must not only produce what it needs, but also produce what the state and other communes need, according to possible conditions. If the commune only produces for its own needs, it will inevitably lead to the situation where it does not produce what it has the conditions to produce, or does not produce more of what it has the conditions to produce. This, of course, is also very absurd. When rural productivity is very low, peasants use almost all their energy to obtain the simplest basic necessities, so some things that can be produced locally but are not needed by themselves have to be not produced or produced less. The gradual improvement of productivity can change this situation. Therefore, the rural people's commune, precisely because the scale of production has expanded, on the one hand, needs to obtain various means of production and means of subsistence from outside the commune (from the state, from other communes), and on the other hand, is more able to supply the state and other communes with various products (including grain, industrial raw materials, handicraft products, industrial products, etc.), rather than becoming a more self-sufficient economic unit. In other words, the people's commune has the possibility and the necessity to develop both self-sufficient production, producing products directly for its own needs, and commodity production, producing products for the needs of the state and other communes.

    Commodity economy in rural China is still underdeveloped even now. Since the founding of the People's Republic, in the process of gradually realizing cooperation by removing feudal exploitation from the small-peasant economy, the Party and the government have actively helped farmers increase the output of grain and various technical crops, develop diversified operations and sideline production, and vigorously organize the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the commodity portion of agricultural and sideline products has increased year by year. Compared with 1952, the commodity amount of agricultural and sideline products increased by 23%. However, the proportion of commodities in the total output value of agricultural and sideline products has only been about one-third over the years. Moreover, a considerable portion of the agricultural and sideline products sold by farmers are mutually exchanged within the scope of agricultural and sideline industries, and only a little more than half of these agricultural and sideline products are used to exchange industrial products. This situation, in the final analysis, is a reflection of the low labor productivity in rural areas and the fact that farmers have not yet escaped poverty.

    After the establishment of the people's commune, because the original several handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives merged into one people's commune, the commodities that needed to be exchanged between them were changed to direct distribution within the commune; the commune runs industry, and some industrial raw materials are no longer sold but used by themselves. But this is only one aspect of the situation. It is impossible to conclude that the commune's commodity production will be greatly reduced based on this aspect of the situation. The more important aspect of the situation is that although the people's commune was established not long ago, the facts have proved that the organizational form of the people's commune can make production leap forward. With the improvement of labor productivity and the expansion of the scale of production, the commune will be able to produce more things to supply the needs of its own expanded reproduction and improve the needs of its members' lives, and at the same time produce more things to sell to the state and other communes, and use them to exchange more means of production and means of subsistence that it needs. In the past, farmers used most of their labor in grain production, making it difficult to greatly develop technical crops and other production. In the future, using the superior conditions of the people's commune to improve the agricultural farming system and gradually realize agricultural mechanization, the labor used in grain production can be greatly reduced, and it will be possible to produce enough grain while also producing a large amount of industrial raw materials and other things needed by the state. In the past, because the products of the various agricultural cooperatives were generally similar, there was not much need for exchange. In the future, after the various communes have developed diversified operations and industry in accordance with local conditions, the gradual development of the division of labor in production between the various communes will also increase the necessity for mutual commodity circulation. It can be seen that in the future, there will be a great development in commodity circulation between the state and the communes, and between the communes. This development is the result of the development of production in the people's communes, and it will in turn further promote the development of production in the communes and the improvement of the living standards of the members.

    The nature of the people's commune is basically collective ownership, so commodity production and commodity circulation must be adopted between the commune and the state, and between communes, to realize the exchange of products. It is unrealistic to want to abolish commodity production and commodity circulation.

    Some people believe that although the rural people's commune should not become a self-sufficient economic unit, it can not adopt the form of commodity exchange, but implement the same method as state-owned enterprises. The products of the commune and the means of production it needs are all allocated by the state. This idea is generated because they have not figured out the nature of the current rural people's commune, nor have they seriously analyzed the current economic situation in our country.

    Another characteristic of the people's commune is "public," and its degree of public ownership is higher than that of the original agricultural cooperatives, and it already has some elements of ownership by the whole people, but its ownership is basically still collective ownership, and the means of production and products of each commune are basically the collective property of this commune. Since it is the property of the commune, of course, the commune cannot be asked to take out its own products without compensation. In order to obtain certain products from the commune, the state must pay currency, and the commune uses the currency to purchase various means of production and means of subsistence it needs from the state. The same is true between communes. That is to say, between the commune and the state, and between communes, commodity production and commodity circulation should be relied upon to realize the mutual exchange of their products. This exchange method is a beneficial way to develop the production of the commune and the development of the entire national economy under the current conditions, and it is also an acceptable way for farmers. The attempt to immediately abolish commodities in this regard is related to the idea of ​​eagerly transitioning collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. It must be known that collective ownership cannot be transformed into ownership by the whole people by means of causing losses to farmers and collective ownership communes. If it is immediately announced that all products of the commune are to be allocated by the state, that is to turn all products into ownership by the whole people without compensation. Doing so will only hinder the relationship between the state and farmers, hinder the relationship between workers and peasants, and be detrimental to production. People with this idea certainly do not intend to harm the interests of farmers. Perhaps they think that when all the products of the commune are transferred to ownership by the whole people, the state cannot actually take them all away, and it must still leave a part of the materials needed by the commune in production and life for the commune to handle on its own, and for the remaining part, it must still give the commune compensation of equal value after being transferred out. However, if this is done, it is actually maintaining the status quo of collective ownership. Since it can only be done this way, it just proves that under the current conditions, it is unrealistic to want to "abolish" collective ownership, and therefore it is unrealistic to want to "abolish" commodity circulation between the state and the commune.

    Of course, between the state and the commune, it is not just the relationship of commodity exchangers. Each people's commune is a member of the entire national economy and develops production under the unified leadership of the state. The state must give the people's commune various economic support, and the commune must also hand over a part of its income to the state as a due obligation to the state (this is the part currently paid to the state in the form of agricultural tax and other taxes). With the organization of county joint cooperatives, the county joint cooperatives can concentrate a part of the accumulation of each commune and run certain enterprises and undertakings that exceed the scope of collective ownership of the commune. With the development of production in the people's commune and the development of the entire country, the elements of ownership by the whole people in the people's commune will gradually expand, so that conditions can be gradually created to gradually transition the collective ownership of the commune to ownership by the whole people. How to transition collective ownership to ownership by the whole people is an issue that needs to be discussed separately. What needs to be pointed out here is that the collective ownership of the people's commune is adapted to the level of production development in our country now and in the next few years, and when there are these two socialist ownership forms of ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, commodity circulation between the state and the commune, and between communes, cannot be avoided and should not be avoided.

    The people's commune implements a distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system. The wage portion will gradually increase with the development of production, which requires the development of commodity production; even the supply portion should allow people to have appropriate freedom of choice within the scope of supply. The more production develops, the greater the freedom of choice should be, which also requires the development of commodity production.

    Some people believe that after the supply system is implemented, the state or commune can directly distribute all consumer goods to individuals, so that everything that individuals eat and use will not become commodities. ——Is this idea correct? It is incorrect to think that the supply system can be fully implemented now, and it is incorrect to think that the implementation of the supply system will make consumer goods not commodities.

    All personal consumer goods produced by state-owned enterprises, as well as all personal consumer goods obtained by the state from the people's commune through commodity circulation, are sold to all residents as commodities. There are two situations here, one situation is for the members of the people's commune with collective ownership. The commune sells its own products to the state, and thus obtains cash, and distributes a part of it to the members, who use it to purchase various consumer goods from the state through retail networks. Here, it is actually still commodity circulation between the commune and the state. As for the employees of state-owned enterprises, that is another situation. People who engage in productive labor within the scope of ownership by the whole people do not sell anything to the state, nor do they have anything to sell to the state. They do a share of labor for society, and thus obtain a share of wages, and obtain a share of the consumer goods that they can obtain and need from all the products of society in the form of purchase. Here, the state conducts the distribution of personal consumer goods through the form of commodity circulation. It is necessary to sell personal consumer goods as commodities to individuals before reaching the communist society of each according to their ability and each according to their needs. This is not unfavorable to the development of social production and to individual consumers.

    The distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system has already begun to be implemented in the current rural people's commune. The fundamental principle of this distribution system is still the principle of distribution according to work. In socialist society, because the development of productive forces is not high enough, the principle of distribution according to work must be implemented. Only in the advanced stage of communism can the principle of distribution according to work transition to the principle of distribution according to needs. Therefore, on the one hand, we believe that the socialist distribution system according to work itself is not rigid and unshakeable, but on the other hand, we admit that distribution according to work is the fundamental principle of the distribution system in the current society. The implementation of a partial supply system is to some extent beyond the principle of distribution according to work. For example, the implementation of supply for the children of laborers makes it impossible for people to have significant differences in life due to the number of children; however, the difference in wages based on the quantity and quality of labor cannot be completely eliminated. During the period when the people's commune implements the distribution system combining the wage system and the supply system, wages should also gradually increase with the development of production. Since there are wages, of course, many consumer goods must be sold to consumers as commodities.

    The part of the supply system is not necessarily a supply in kind. The supply system implemented in the current stage is not the principle of distribution according to needs of communism. This is a limited supply under a lower level of production that cannot fully meet people's needs. As long as possible, people should be allowed to have appropriate freedom of choice within the scope of what can be supplied, not only the choice of different colors and varieties of the same type of goods, but also the choice of different goods of equal value. The more social production develops, the more types and colors of personal consumer goods can be provided, then not only can the supply standard be improved, but also people can have more room for choice within the supply standard. It is impossible to imagine that the agency that distributes the supply can be so meticulous as to distribute the goods in kind according to everyone's preferences and needs. According to the ability of the commune and the wishes of the masses, it is also feasible to convert a part of the supply into cash, distribute it to each person, and let people purchase the consumer goods they want on their own.

    The supply system is, in a sense, the bud of the communist distribution system, but only under the fundamental premise of highly developed productive forces, that is, when it reaches the advanced stage of communism where Marx said "all sources of public wealth flow as much as possible," can the supply system become distribution according to needs. At that time, how many consumer goods each person obtains from society will be completely based on his actual needs, so it will of course be completely unnecessary to use currency to purchase them.

    In recent years, when the academic community discussed the issue of commodities in socialist society, some people believed that the system of distribution according to work is one of the reasons for the existence of commodity production in socialist society, but some people have expressed doubts about this statement. This doubt is justified. Of course, there is a close relationship between the distribution system according to work and commodity production. But they are not mutually causal, they are the result of the same cause. Their ultimate cause lies in the level of development of social productive forces. Because the level of development of social productive forces has not yet reached the principle of distribution according to needs, it is necessary to adopt the principle of distribution according to work, and therefore it is necessary to realize the distribution of consumer goods among various producers through commodity production. The supply system and distribution according to work are issues of the distribution system. The distribution system cannot determine the fate of commodities. In the final analysis, what determines the fate of commodities is production, not distribution.

    Socialist commodity production will never lead to capitalism, but will only promote the combination of workers and peasants, strengthen the economic ties between the state and the commune, promote the development of socialist construction, and be able to prepare conditions for the transition to communism.

    People who are eager to eliminate commodity production think that there is always a capitalist "ghost" hiding in commodities, and they are afraid that developing commodity production and commodity exchange will lead to this "ghost." They do not know how to distinguish between capitalist commodities and socialist commodities. What is engaged in commodity production in our country now is neither capitalists nor individual small producers, but socialist countries and socialist collective producers (mainly people's communes, and currently there are still some handicraft cooperatives). This kind of commodity production is not for the purpose of pursuing profits, but in accordance with the basic economic laws of socialism, for the purpose of meeting the needs of the people; it is not anarchic, but is carried out under the unified leadership and unified planning of the state. Will this kind of commodity production create capitalism? Obviously, this kind of commodity production is not something terrible, but something that can serve socialism well.

    In recent years, we have fought a great battle with the capitalist commodity economy. We eliminated capitalist ownership of the means of production and replaced capitalist commerce with socialist commerce, so we were able to defeat the capitalist commodity economy. Before 1953, private commerce still had a considerable influence in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; since the implementation of unified purchase and sales in the second half of 1953, socialist commerce has rapidly gained a dominant position. The commodity volume of agricultural and sideline products has increased year by year, and there has been no harm, because at that time, although the collectivization of the countryside had not yet been realized, this was already commodity production and commodity circulation under the leadership of the socialist state-owned economy. After the complete completion of rural collectivization and the realization of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, there are no longer any capitalist elements in commodity production and commodity circulation. As long as the objective laws of the socialist economy are followed, the production of the country and the production of the commune are developed in a planned way, and the commodity circulation between the country, the commune, and individual consumers is organized in a planned way, then commodity production and commodity circulation must be a beneficial factor in promoting the socialist economy. Conversely, if the objective economic laws are violated, and attempts are made to "abolish" commodity production by taking certain measures when commodity production is still playing an active role, then the result will inevitably be the destruction of production and the disintegration of the economic life of the entire society. On the contrary, it creates favorable conditions for the growth of spontaneous capitalist forces.

    There is certainly no danger in the people's commune developing commodity production under the leadership of the state. It will only promote the combination of workers and peasants in our country, strengthen the economic ties between the state and the people's commune, and enable the economy of the commune and the economy of the state to develop smoothly. The more developed the commune's commodity production is, the more various means of production the commune can obtain, and at the same time, it can issue more wages to the members, thereby further improving the living standards of the members. The increase in the commodities provided by the commune and the increase in the collective and individual purchasing power of the commune will also further promote the development of the entire national economy.

    In order to have more means of production to supply the people's commune, the state must develop commodity production in the means of production, and in order to have more means of subsistence to supply all residents, the state must develop commodity production in the means of subsistence. Developing commodity production of consumer goods in accordance with the national plan is to make it possible for the people of our country to obtain more consumer goods and to be able to choose from more and more diverse products. We are not afraid that the rich and colorful commodity production will stimulate the needs of the people, because this need will in turn further promote the development of production.

    It should also be mentioned here that because commodities and the law of value still exist, we can use the law of value to urge all enterprises to pay attention to economic accounting, improve production management, and increase labor productivity. In this article, the issue of whether the means of production that are allocated within the scope of ownership by the whole people are commodities is not discussed. There are different views on this issue in the academic community. Although the transfer of products from one state-owned enterprise to another state-owned enterprise is not a real transaction (it is not a change from the hands of one owner to the hands of another), it is also necessary to calculate the value, stipulate the price, and through the form of payment and collection, it also has the nature of a commodity. It is not without meaning to maintain this commodity nature, but it is beneficial to production and operation. The people's commune should also make good use of the law of value, learn to calculate costs, conduct economic accounting, not only in the part of commodity production, but also in the part of self-sufficient production.

    Finally, it should also be pointed out that the development of socialist commodity production is conducive to creating conditions for the gradual transition of the collective ownership of the people's commune to ownership by the whole people, and the transition from socialism to communism is mainly determined by the enormous development of productive forces and the great increase in products. Therefore, we can not only use commodity production to promote the development of socialism, but also use commodity production to prepare conditions for the transition to communism.

    关于我国现在的商品生产
    胡绳
    资本家的生产资料所有制在我国已经不存在了，因此，在我国也就消灭了资本主义的商品生产；现在在我国存在的是社会主义的商品生产，它是以社会主义的全民所有制和社会主义的集体所有制为基础的。
    社会主义制度下的各种社会条件，使得社会主义的商品生产必然要存在和发展；只有在这些社会条件消失了的情形下，商品生产才会自然消亡。以为我国现在不需要商品生产，现在可以消灭商品和货币，是完全错误的。我国现在不但还需要有商品生产，而且还要大大地发展商品生产，当然发展的是社会主义商品生产，而不是资本主义商品生产。
    关于社会主义制度下的商品生产，在实践上和理论上有很多问题值得研究。这里只是就我国现在的商品生产初步地讨论几个问题。
    人民公社既有可能也有必要发展商品性生产。今后，在国家和公社、公社和公社间的商品流通会有很大发展。这是人民公社生产发展的结果，又将促进公社生产的发展和社员生活水平的提高
    农村的人民公社化，对于我国的商品生产会发生什么影响呢？是不是因为有了人民公社，就可以“废除”商品生产呢？
    有人把人民公社看成是一个自给自足的经济单位，或者认为，它应该朝这个方向发展；按照这种看法，既然五亿农民的产品退出了商品交换的范围，当然就使我国商品生产大大缩小，以至可以消灭了。这种看法是和事实不符的。人民公社具有“大”的特点（比原来的农业合作社大得多），它能够进行多种经营，不但农林牧副渔结合，而且要工农业并举；但是决不能设想，人民公社能够生产本社所需要的一切生产资料和生活资料。现在每个人民公社为了进一步发展生产，就会考虑到添置拖拉机、汽车和各种机器，生产越发展，它对这些东西的需要越多，这些东西是不可能由它自己全部生产出来的。随着公社生产的发展，社员们的生活水平也逐渐提高，他们在物质生活和文化生活上的需要更加复杂起来，这些需要也不是公社自己的生产所能全部满足的。如果公社满足于自己所能制造的生产资料和生活资料，就必然妨害生产的发展和生活水平的提高。如果公社不顾资源条件和技术条件的限制硬要去生产一切自己所需要的东西，结果只会造成人力物力的浪费。同时，又不能认为，凡是一个公社自己不需要的东西，它就不去生产。每个公社不但要生产自己所需要的东西，而且要按照可能条件，生产为国家、为别的公社所需要的东西。如果公社只是为自己的需要而生产，那就势必会弄到，它有条件可以生产的东西，不生产；有条件可以多生产的东西，不多生产。这样做，当然也是非常荒谬的。在农村生产力很低的时候，农民为了获得最简单的基本生活资料，几乎用了全部力量，所以有些在本地有条件可以生产而不是自己所需要的东西，只好不生产或少生产。生产力的逐渐提高就能使这种情况改变。所以，农村人民公社，正是因为生产规模扩大了，在一方面，更需要从公社以外（从国家、从别的公社）得到各种生产资料和生活资料，并且在另一方面，更能够以各种产品（包括粮食、工业原料、手工业产品、工业产品等等）供应国家和其他公社，而不是更加成为自给自足的经济单位。这也就是说，人民公社有可能，也有必要，既发展自给性的生产，生产直接为了自己所需要的产品，又发展商品性的生产，生产为国家和别的公社所需要的产品。
    我国农村中商品经济直到现在还是不发达的。人民共和国成立以来，在小农经济解除了封建剥削逐步地实现合作化的过程中，党和政府积极地帮助农民提高粮食和各种技术作物的产量，发展多种经营和副业生产，并且大力组织城乡物资交流，因此农副业产品中商品部分逐年都有增大，拿1957年和1952年相比，农副产品的商品额增加了23％。但是在农副业产品的总产值中，商品所占比率，历年来只有三分之一左右。而且在农民所出售的农副业商品中还有不小的部分是在农副业范围内的互相交换，用来交换工业产品的只占这些农副业商品中的一半稍多。这种情形，归根结底，是农村中劳动生产率很低，农民生活还没有摆脱贫穷状况的反映。
    在人民公社成立以后，原来的几个手工业社和农业社因为合成了一个人民公社，它们之间需要互相交换的商品就改变为公社内部的直接分配了；公社办了工业，有些工业原料就不再出售而自己利用了。但这只是一个方面的情形。决不能根据这一方面的情形就断定公社的商品生产会大大缩小。更重要的一方面的情形是，人民公社虽然成立不久，但事实已经证明，人民公社的组织形式能够使生产飞跃地向前发展。随着劳动生产率的提高和生产规模的扩大，公社就能够生产出更多的东西来供应本社扩大再生产的需要和改善社员生活的需要，同时又生产出更多的东西来出售给国家和别的公社，用来更多地换取为自己所需要的生产资料和生活资料。在过去的情况下，农民以绝大部分劳动用在粮食生产上面，难以大大发展技术作物和其他生产，今后，利用人民公社的优越条件，进行农业耕作制度的改进，并且逐步实现农业机械化，那就可以大大减少用于粮食生产上的劳动，而能够在生产足够多的粮食的同时，又大量生产为国家所需要的工业原料和其他东西。在过去的情况下，各个农业社之间，因为生产物一般地差不多，不需要很多交换，今后在各个公社因地制宜地发展了多种经营和发展了工业以后，各个公社间逐渐发展了生产上的分工，也就增加了相互间商品流通的必要。由此可见，在今后，在国家和公社、公社和公社间，商品流通是会有一个很大的发展的。这种发展是人民公社生产发展的结果，而且又将回过来，更促进公社生产的发展和社员生活水平的提高。
    人民公社的性质基本上是集体所有制，因此，公社与国家间、公社与公社间必须采取商品生产和商品流通来实现产品的交换。要想废除商品生产和商品流通是不现实的
    有人以为，农村人民公社固然不应当成为自给自足的经济单位，但是可以不采取商品交换的形式，而实行和国营企业同样的办法，公社的产品和它所需要的生产资料都由国家调拨。这种想法是由于没有弄清楚现在农村人民公社的性质，也没有认真地分析我国现在的经济状况而产生的。
    人民公社的另一个特点是“公”，它的公有化程度比原来的农业合作社更高，并且已经带有若干全民所有制的成分，但是它的所有制基本上仍然是集体所有制，每一个公社的生产资料和产品基本上都是这个公社的集体的财产。既然是公社的财产，当然不能无代价地要公社拿出自己的产品来。国家为要取得公社的某些产品，必须付给货币，而公社又用货币向国家购买各种它所需要的生产资料和生活资料。在公社和公社间也是同样。这就是说，在公社和国家、公社和公社之间，应该依靠商品生产和商品流通来实现它们的产品的相互交换。这种交换方式在现在条件下是对发展公社的生产和发展整个国民经济有利的方式，也是农民能够接受的方式。企图在这方面立即废除商品的想法，是和急于把集体所有制过渡为全民所有制的想法相关联的。必须知道，决不能用使农民遭受损失，使集体所有制的公社遭受损失的办法来把集体所有制转变为全民所有制。如果立即宣布把公社的一切产品都由国家调拨，那就是使一切产品无代价地转为全民所有，这样做，只会妨害国家和农民的关系，妨害工农关系，而不利于生产。有这种想法的人，当然并不是企图损害农民的利益。也许他们这样想，在把公社的一切产品都转为全民所有的时候，实际上国家也不可能全部拿去，一定还是把公社在生产和生活中所需要的一部分物资留给公社自行处理，而对于其余的部分在调出去以后也还是要给予公社以同等价值的补偿。但是，如果这样做，那在实际上就是保持集体所有制的现状；既然只能这样做，那就恰好证明在现在条件下，想要“废除”集体所有制是不现实的，因而想要“废除”国家和公社间的商品流通也是不现实的。
    当然，在国家和公社之间，并不只是商品交换者的关系。每个人民公社是整个国民经济中的一个分子，是在国家的统一领导下发展生产的。国家要给予人民公社以各种经济上的支持，而公社也要把自己收入中的一个部分上缴给国家，作为对国家的一种应尽的义务（这就是目前以农业税和其他税金的形式缴给国家的一个部分）。有了县联社的组织，县联社就可以集中各社的一部分积累，兴办超过公社的集体所有制范围的某些企业和事业。随着人民公社生产的发展和整个国家的生产的发展，在人民公社中的全民所有制成分将逐渐扩大，那样才能逐渐创造条件，使公社的集体所有制逐步地过渡到全民所有制。关于集体所有制如何过渡到全民所有制，是需要另外讨论的问题，这里所要指出的是，人民公社的集体所有制在现在和今后若干年内，是和我国的生产发展水平相适应的，而在存在着全民所有制和集体所有制这两种社会主义所有制形式的时候，在国家和公社、公社和公社之间的商品流通就是不能够避免，也是不应当避免的。
    人民公社实行供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度，工资部分将随着生产的发展逐步增长，这就要求发展商品生产；就是供给部分，也应当让人们在供给范围内有适当选择的自由，生产越发展，选择的自由应越大，这也要求发展商品生产
    有人以为，实行了供给制以后，就可以由国家或公社把一切生活消费品直接分配给个人，这样也就可以使个人的一切吃的、用的东西都不成为商品了。——这种想法对不对呢？以为现在可以全面实行供给制，以为实行供给制就可以使生活消费品不是商品，这种想法都是不对的。
    国营企业所生产的一切个人生活消费品，以及国家经过商品流通从人民公社所取得的一切个人生活消费品，是作为商品而卖给全体居民的。这里面又有两种情形，一种情形是对于集体所有制的人民公社的社员。公社把自己的产品卖给国家，因而获得现金，把其中一部分分配给社员，社员用来经过零售网向国家购买各种消费品。这里，实际上还是公社和国家之间的商品流通。至于对国营企业的职工，那就是另外一种情形了。在全民所有制范围内从事生产劳动的人，并不向国家出卖什么东西，他们也没有任何东西可以出卖给国家。他们为社会做了一分劳动，因而取得一分工资，并用购买的形式从社会的全部生产品中取得一分他所可以取得和他所需要的生活消费品。在这里，国家是通过商品流通的形式来进行个人生活消费品的分配的。个人生活消费品作为商品卖给个人，在还没有到达各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义社会的时候，是必要的；这对于社会生产的发展和对于个人消费者都没有什么不利。
    现在农村人民公社中已经开始实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。这种分配制度的根本原则仍然是按劳分配的原则。在社会主义社会中，因为生产力的发展还不够高，就必须实行按劳分配的原则，只有到了共产主义的高级阶段，按劳分配的原则才能过渡到按需要分配的原则。因此，我们一方面认为，社会主义的按劳分配制度本身不是凝固不变的，不是不可动摇的，但一方面又承认，按劳分配是现在社会中分配制度的根本原则。实行部分供给制是在某种程度内越出了按劳分配的原则，例如由于对劳动者的子女实行供给就使得人们不至于因为子女的多少而在生活上悬殊；但是，决不能完全取消以劳动的数量和质量为根据的工资的差别。人民公社在实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度的期间，还要使工资随着生产的发展而逐步增长。既然有工资，当然，就有许多生活消费品要当做商品出售给消费者。
    在实行供给制的部分也并不一定是实物供给。在现阶段内实行的供给制还不是实行共产主义的按需要分配的原则，这是在较低的生产水平下的不能充分满足人们需要的有限度的供给。只要有可能，就应当让人们在可以供给的范围内有适当选择的自由，不仅是同类物品的不同花色品种的选择，而且是同等价值的不同物品的选择。社会生产越发展，所能提供的个人消费品的种类和花色就越多，那么不但供给的标准可以提高，而且人们在供给的标准内进行选择的余地也就更大。不能设想，分配供给的机关可以细致到按照每个人的爱好和需要来进行实物的分配。根据公社的能力和群众的愿望，把一部分供给折成现金，发给每一个人，让人们自行购买他所要的消费品，也是可行的。
    供给制在一定意义上是共产主义分配制度的萌芽，但只有在生产力高度发展的根本前提下，也就是到了马克思所说的“一切公共财富泉源都尽量涌现出来”的共产主义高级阶段的时候，供给制才能变成按需分配。在那时候，每一个人从社会取得多少消费品，完全根据他的实际需要，因此，用货币来购买当然也将是完全不必要的了。
    近几年来，学术界在讨论社会主义社会中的商品问题的时候，有人认为，按劳分配的制度是社会主义社会存在商品生产的一个原因，但是也有人对这种说法表示怀疑。这种怀疑是有理由的。当然，按劳分配制和商品生产，二者是有密切联系的。但它们并不是互为因果，它们是由同一个原因产生的结果。它们的终极原因是在社会生产力发展的水平上。因为社会生产力发展水平还没有达到可以实行按需要分配的原则，所以才必须采取按劳分配的原则，因而也就有必要经过商品生产来实现消费品在各个生产者中间的分配。供给制和按劳分配是分配制度上的问题。分配制度不能决定商品的命运。归根结底，决定商品命运的，是生产而不是分配。
    社会主义的商品生产，决不会引出资本主义来，只会促进工农间的结合，加强国家和公社间的经济联系，促进社会主义建设的发展，并能够为过渡到共产主义准备条件
    急于消灭商品生产的人以为商品中间总是躲着资本主义的“鬼”，他们害怕发展商品生产和商品交换就会引出这个“鬼”来。他们不知道区别资本主义的商品和社会主义的商品。我国现在从事商品生产的既不是资本家，也不是个体小生产者，而是社会主义国家，社会主义集体生产者（主要是人民公社，目前还有一些手工业合作社）。这种商品生产不是为了追逐利润的目的，而是按照社会主义的基本经济规律，为了满足人民需要的目的；不是无政府的，而是在国家统一领导和统一计划下进行的。难道这种商品生产会造成资本主义么？显然，这种商品生产并不是什么可怕的东西，而是能够很好地为社会主义服务的东西。
    几年来，我们和资本主义的商品经济做了很大的斗争。我们消除了资本主义的生产资料所有制，并用社会主义商业来代替资本主义商业，所以我们就能够战胜资本主义的商品经济。在1953年以前，在城乡物资交流中，私营商业还有相当大的势力；自1953年下半年实行统购统销后，社会主义商业就迅速地取得了优势地位。农副业产品的商品量逐年增加，并没有发生什么害处，因为那时虽然农村的合作化还没有实现，但是这已经是在社会主义的国营经济领导下的商品生产和商品流通了。到了农村合作化全部完成，并且实现了对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造以后，在商品生产和商品流通中间就再没有任何资本主义的成分了。只要按照社会主义经济的客观规律，有计划地发展国家的生产和公社的生产，有计划地组织国家、公社和消费者个人之间的商品流通，那么商品生产和商品流通就必然是促进社会主义经济的有利因素。反之，如果违反了客观经济规律，在商品生产还在起积极作用的时候，企图采取某些措施来“废除”商品生产，那就必然得到破坏生产、瓦解整个社会的经济生活的结果，反而是给资本主义自发势力的生长造成了有利条件。
    人民公社在国家的领导下发展商品生产当然不会有什么危险性。那将只会促进我国工农间的结合，加强国家和人民公社间的经济联系，使公社的经济和国家的经济都能顺利地向前发展。公社的商品生产越发达，公社就能够更多地取得各种生产资料，同时也能更多地发给社员以工资，因而更加提高社员的生活水平。由于公社提供的商品的增加，公社的集体和个人的购买力的提高，也就更促进了整个国民经济的发展。
    为了要有更多的生产资料供给人民公社，国家就要发展在生产资料方面的商品生产，为了要有更多的生活资料供给全体居民，国家就要发展生活资料方面的商品生产。按照国家计划发展生活消费品的商品生产，是为了使我国人民有可能获得更多的生活消费品，并且可能从更多种多样的产品中进行选择。我们不害怕丰富多采的商品生产刺激起人民的需要，因为这种需要反过来又将更推动生产的发展。
    这里还应该提到，由于还存在着商品和价值法则，我们就可以利用价值法则来促使一切企业都注意经济核算，改进生产管理，提高劳动生产率。在本文中，没有谈到在全民所有制范围内实行调拨的生产资料是否商品的问题，这个问题在学术界中是有不同的看法的。产品从一个国营企业调拨到另一个国营企业，虽然不是真正的买卖（不是从一个所有者的手里换到另一个所有者的手里），但是也要计算价值，规定价格，通过付款收款的形式，也具有商品的性质。保持这种商品的性质不是没有意义，而是有利于生产经营的。人民公社同样也应该很好地利用价值法则，学会计算成本，进行经济核算，不但在商品生产的部分应当如此，就是在自给生产的部分也应当如此。
    最后，还应当指出，社会主义的商品生产的发展，是有利于创造条件使人民公社的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制去的，而由社会主义到共产主义的过渡，最主要的是决定于生产力的巨大发展和产品的大大增加，所以，我们不仅能够利用商品生产来促进社会主义的发展，而且还能够利用商品生产来为过渡到共产主义准备条件。
