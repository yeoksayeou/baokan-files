    Busily searching for iron ore day and night
    With bamboo baskets on our backs and dry rations in tow,
    Climbing over ridges and crossing hills;
    To hoist the banner of steel early on,
    Busily searching for iron ore day and night.

    寻找铁矿日夜忙
    背上箥筐带干粮，
    爬上岭头又过岗；
    为了钢帅早升帐，
    寻找铁矿日夜忙。
