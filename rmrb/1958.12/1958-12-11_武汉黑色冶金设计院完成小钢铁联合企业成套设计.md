Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric News The Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute has recently developed a set of designs for small iron and steel complexes suitable for universal construction by counties and people's communes.

This small iron and steel complex is divided into iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, coke refining, refractory materials and other parts. Because the design adopts a combination of indigenous and foreign methods and uses the experience of "small indigenous groups" in various places in smelting iron and steel, it can guarantee the quality of iron and steel in production, so that iron can be made into steel, and steel can be rolled into qualified steel. This iron and steel complex can be built in about ten days with local materials, except for a small part of the power equipment. Its iron-making part has four 3-cubic-meter native furnaces or ten 1.5-cubic-meter native furnaces (including spares); the annual output can reach 7,000 tons. The steelmaking part has one 200 kg fixed converter, which uses hot blast furnace iron for hot charging and blowing, with an annual output of 5,000 tons.

    武汉黑色冶金设计院完成小钢铁联合企业成套设计
    据新华社武汉电  黑色冶金设计院武汉分院，最近做出了一套适合县和人民公社普遍兴办的小型钢铁联合企业的设计。
    这种小型钢铁联合企业共分炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、炼焦、耐火材料等部分。由于设计上采取了土洋结合和运用了各地“小土群”炼钢铁的经验，因此在生产中可以保证钢铁的质量，使铁能成钢，钢能轧成合格钢材。这种钢铁联合企业除很少一部分动力设备外，其他设备依靠当地材料十天左右就可以建设起来。它的炼铁部分有三立方公尺的土炉四座或一点五立方公尺的土炉十座（包括备用的）；年产量可达七千吨。炼钢部分有二百公斤的固定式转炉一个，用高炉铁水热装吹炼，年产量可达五千吨。
