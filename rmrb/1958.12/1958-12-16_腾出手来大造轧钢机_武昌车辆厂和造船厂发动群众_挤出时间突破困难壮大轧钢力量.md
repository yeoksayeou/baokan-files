Free Up Hands to Vigorously Build Rolling Mills
Wuchang Vehicle Factory and Shipyard Mobilize the Masses
Squeeze Out Time, Overcome Difficulties, and Strengthen Rolling Mill Power

This newspaper reports that the Wuchang Shipyard is rushing to produce a thin-plate rolling mill with a diameter of 760×1200. Workers are guaranteeing the completion of the first set by the end of December at the fastest speed, and the remaining four sets of the same specifications will also be completed in the first quarter of next year.

Each set of this thin-plate rolling mill weighs more than 360 tons, and the largest part weighs up to 30 tons. According to design requirements, it can produce 30,000 tons of various thin steel plates annually, the thinnest of which is 0.35 millimeters, as thin as paper. It can also produce silicon steel sheets required for motors, etc.

In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient machinery, they adopted the method of "ants gnawing at bones," using small equipment to do big jobs. On the other hand, they actively manufactured and improved tools. Turner Min Daogui converted an old lathe into a special planer that can perform nineteen working surfaces, increasing efficiency by one to two times. The workers in Workshop No. 3, which undertook the largest task of manufacturing the rolling mill, also launched a competition.

Currently, various machines for manufacturing the rolling mill have been basically completed. Parts for the first rolling mill are being rushed, and materials for the remaining four have already been issued. All will be completed in the first quarter of next year.

This newspaper reports that a comprehensive production leap forward centered on manufacturing rolling mills is unfolding at the Wuchang Vehicle Factory. The factory's first rolling mill has been born, and five more can be completed by the end of the year.

The Wuchang Vehicle Factory is a factory specializing in manufacturing freight cars and refrigerated cars, lacking experience in manufacturing rolling mills. In the first half of this year, according to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Party Committees, the factory began trial production of rolling mills. The factory quickly established a trial production preparation team and immediately sent people to the Hanyang Rolling Mill and Wuhan Metallurgical Design Institute to visit and learn. By the end of August, the manufacture of rolling mills had entered the full production stage. In the manufacturing process, the factory Party committee and the branch committees of various workshops relied on the masses to overcome difficulties without reducing the tasks of vehicle manufacturing and metallurgical equipment manufacturing. For example, the structural workshop adopted the method of counter-rotating to hug the "watermelon," concentrating all the sand castings and convening representatives of relevant groups to discuss. As a result, in less than an hour, each group took away the most difficult casting processing tasks. The six frame seats of the rolling mill were difficult to process, and it took six days to make one using a gantry planer. Later, the workers came up with a way to use a shaper for processing, and one was made in one day. Another example is the gear box, which could not be processed originally. With the help of technicians, the Pan Jingzheng group used a hob to roll it, solving the most difficult processing problem. The factory also set up a rolling mill assembly team to carry out rapid assembly. The rolling mill has now been manufactured. The factory is organizing a comprehensive leap forward with the manufacture of rolling mills as the primary task. (Attached picture)

### 腾出手来大造轧钢机  武昌车辆厂和造船厂发动群众  挤出时间突破困难壮大轧钢力量

    腾出手来大造轧钢机
    武昌车辆厂和造船厂发动群众
    挤出时间突破困难壮大轧钢力量
    本报讯  直径760×1200的薄板轧钢机正在武昌造船厂赶制。职工们用最快的速度保证12月底完成第一套，其余同样规格的四套也要在明年第一季度全部完成。
    这种薄板轧钢机，每套体重三百六十多吨；最大的零件重达三十吨。按设计要求能力，它每年可生产各种薄板钢材三万吨，其中最薄的钢板是零点三五米厘，薄得像纸一样，还可以生产电动机所需用的矽钢片等。
    为了克服机器不足的困难，他们一方面用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，以小干大；另一方面积极制造和改进工具。车工闵道贵用一部旧车床改制成一种特别刨床，可以作十九个工作面，提高工效一倍到二倍以上。承制轧钢机任务最大的三号车间职工，还开展了竞赛运动。
    目前，制造轧钢机的各种机器已基本完成，第一套轧钢机零件正在赶制，其余四部已经下料，明年第一季度全部完成。
    本报讯  一个以制造轧钢机为中心的全面生产大跃进，正在武昌车辆厂展开。这个厂的第一台轧钢机已经诞生，年底还可以完成五台。
    武昌车辆厂是专门制造货车和冷藏车的工厂，缺乏制造轧钢机的经验。今年上半年这个厂根据湖北省和武汉市委的指示，即着手试制轧钢机；厂部迅速成立了试制准备组，马上派人到汉阳轧钢厂、武汉黑色冶金设计院参观学习。8月底，制造轧钢机就进入了全面生产阶段。在制造过程中，厂党委和各车间支部依靠群众，在不缩减车辆制造和冶金设备制造任务的情况下，克服了困难。如结构车间采用双反时抱“西瓜”的办法，把所有的翻砂件集中起来，召集有关小组代表讨论，结果不到一小时，各小组就把最困难的铸件加工任务抱走了。轧钢机的六个机架座加工困难，用龙门刨加工需六天才能做成一个。后来，工人们想办法改用扦床加工，一天就做成了一个。再如齿轮箱本来没有办法加工，潘京正小组在技术员的帮助下用滚刀滚，把最困难的加工问题解决了。厂里还专门成立了轧钢机组装小组，展开快速组装。现在轧钢机已经制成。这个厂以制造轧钢机为首要任务，正在组织全面大跃进。（附图片）
