	Unite as One to Defend the Achievements of the Revolution and the Independence of the Republic
	Iraqi People Rally in a Crowd of 50,000 to Protest American Conspiracy Activities
	New U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Says U.S. is Uneasy About the Situation in Iraq
	Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, December 20th: Fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Iraq participated in the opening ceremony of Peace Week held in the city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, on the 19th. Participants included workers, students, religious figures, and others.
	Aziz Sherif, Secretary-General of the Iraqi National Peace Fighters Committee, spoke first at the meeting. He revealed that imperialism is attempting to oppose the Iraqi Republic from two aspects: on the one hand, it is taking measures such as the United States and the remaining countries of the Baghdad Pact concluding agreements; on the other hand, it is plotting conspiracy activities in an attempt to undermine Iraq's national unity.
	The conference passed a telegram to Prime Minister Qasim saying: "We declare that we must unite well to defend the achievements of the revolution, the independence of the republic, and its republican democracy. We will wholeheartedly fight against those who attempt to divide our ranks and those who plot against the republic."
	The conference also telegraphed the embassies of Iran and Turkey, saying: "We protest the imperialist military treaties concluded by the United States, which aim to threaten the security of our peace-loving republic and nation, as well as the security of other free Arab countries. These treaties aim to subject the Iranian and Turkish nations to the plans of American imperialism. We protest the conspiracy activities carried out by the imperialists with the help of their lackeys."
	Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Washington dispatch: The new U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Jernegan, said on the 18th that the United States is "somewhat uneasy" about the situation in Iraq.
	Jernegan made this statement after meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower before being sworn in.

    团结一致保卫革命成果和共和国的独立  
    伊拉克五万人集会抗议美国阴谋活动
    新任美国驻伊大使说美国对伊拉克局势感到不安
    新华社巴格达20日电  伊拉克各界人民五万人参加了19日在巴格达南面的纳加夫城举行的和平周开幕式群众大会。参加大会的人包括工人、学生、宗教界人士等。
    伊拉克和平战士全国委员会总书记阿齐兹·谢里夫首先在会上讲话。他揭露帝国主义图谋从两方面反对伊拉克共和国：一方面采取美国和巴格达条约残余国家缔结协定的手段，另一方面策划阴谋活动，图谋破坏伊拉克的民族团结。
    大会通过致卡塞姆总理的电文说：“我们宣布要很好地团结一致保卫革命的成果、共和国的独立和它的共和民主政治。我们将全心全意对企图分裂我们的队伍和图谋反对共和国的那些人进行斗争。”
    大会还打电报给伊朗和土耳其的大使馆说：“我们对美国缔结的帝国主义的军事条约提出抗议，美国的目的是威胁我们爱好和平的共和国和民族的安全，以及其它自由的阿拉伯国家的安全。这些条约的目的是要使伊朗和土耳其民族屈从于美国帝国主义的计划。我们对帝国主义者在他们的走狗的效劳下进行的阴谋活动提出抗议。”
    据新华社21日讯  华盛顿消息：新任美国驻伊拉克大使杰尼干18日说：美国对伊拉克的局势“多少有点不安”。
    杰尼干是在宣誓就任前与美国总统艾森豪威尔会晤后说这话的。
