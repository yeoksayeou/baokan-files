Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th – After Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation launched a mass movement, pig iron production exceeded design targets. The daily pig iron production of the No. 1 Blast Furnace, which should have been 2,070 tons according to design, averaged only 1,385.6 tons in early November, then jumped to 2,098.84 tons in mid-November. From the 21st to the 27th of the last ten days of the month, the average daily production was 2,100.17 tons, reaching a maximum of 2,339 tons. The coke produced by the coking plant has, since the 20th, seen its ash content reduced from 20%-22% to 15%-16% while maintaining production, and the coke strength has also reached the company's specified targets.

According to design requirements, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 Blast Furnace should use a high-pressure furnace top, with ore containing 80% sintered ore, and the coke ash content should not exceed 12%. However, when the No. 1 Blast Furnace was put into production, due to time constraints, a temporary switchboard was used, which could not operate at high pressure. At the same time, in the context of the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign, raw materials and fuel were in short supply, and requirements could not be fully met, affecting normal production. Since October, under the leadership of the Party Committee, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has launched a "large-scale, foreign, and mass" movement, conducting extensive debates on how to improve production under existing conditions, criticizing the "condition-only theory" and the conservative thinking of "willingness to remain in the middle" of a few leading cadres. It sought ways to fully utilize the favorable conditions of large enterprises from all aspects, actively overcoming the difficulties of poor raw material and fuel quality, and immediately adopted technical measures, referring to Soviet and domestic experience, to replace the temporary switchboard with an automated switchboard capable of high-pressure operation, changing from normal pressure to high-pressure operation. In order to shorten the time for changing from normal pressure to high pressure, the workers carefully inspected all equipment to prevent gas leakage and increase the furnace temperature. Workers in front of the furnace also submitted guarantee letters, "leaving difficulties to themselves and convenience to others," and a red flag competition was launched between shifts, groups, and individuals, cooperating with each other to ensure safe production.

On October 28, the No. 1 Blast Furnace began to dismantle the switchboard. A labor force of more than 1,000 workers from various trades only used 27 hours to replace the temporary switchboard with an automated switchboard, two days ahead of the original plan. Subsequently, the employees of the No. 1 Blast Furnace conducted high-pressure operation tests. Usually, it takes more than three months to change the blast furnace from normal pressure to high pressure, but the No. 1 Blast Furnace completed it in just one week. On November 15, the furnace top pressure was increased to 0.8 kilograms, the air volume was increased to 2,400 cubic meters, the smelting intensity was increased, and the iron production rapidly jumped to 2,214 tons. Since the adoption of high-pressure operation, the iron notch and slag notch have been well protected, no accidents have occurred, and iron and slag discharge have been timely.

In order to produce more iron, workers also sought ways to save time from all aspects. Under high-temperature operation conditions, it used to take 15 minutes to change a tuyere, but now workers like Zhang Rupo have created a new record of changing one in six minutes. They also thought of many ways to improve the quality of coke. The coking plant does not have a coal washing plant, so the workers picked stones next to the conveyor belt. The coal preparation workshop has a wide and high belt, which runs very fast, and it is difficult to pick stones. After collective research, the workers added an iron grate to the belt to prevent large stones from leaking, which improved the efficiency of picking stones. Workers such as Li Shufan carefully cleaned up the old coal accumulated on the coal preparation plate and belt conveyor with iron rods to avoid disrupting the coal preparation ratio and affecting the quality of coke. Cai Zonggui, the leader of the Class A Party group, also spent four and a half days researching a local method of coal washing equipment, which will be able to wash coal soon.

Many leading cadres have left their offices and gone deep into the lower levels. The director of the iron smelting plant now takes turns day and night to go to the shifts, directing production and solving technical problems at any time. The workers reflected: Now problems can be solved immediately, and they are more motivated to work.

    群众运动在武钢一号高炉初奏捷音
    新炉上阵产量迅速上升
    新华社武汉30日电  武汉钢铁公司大搞群众运动后，使生铁产量超过设计指标。一号高炉的生铁日产量，按照设计指标应该是二○七○吨，11月上旬平均只有一千三百八十五点六吨，中旬一跃升为二千○九十八点八四吨，下旬从21日到27日，平均日产二千一百点一七吨，最高时曾经达到二千三百三十九吨。焦化厂生产的焦炭，自20日以来在保证产量的同时，灰分由过去的20％—22％降低到15％—16％，焦炭的强度也达到了公司规定的指标。
    武钢一号高炉，按照设计要求，要采用高压炉顶，所用矿石，要掺有80％的烧结矿，焦炭灰分不得超过12％。而一号高炉在投入生产时，由于时间紧，采用的是临时配电盘，不能高压操作，同时，在全民大办钢铁的情况下，原料、燃料都很紧张，也不能完全符合要求，影响生产的正常进行。10月份以来，武钢在党委的领导下掀起了“大、洋、群”运动，围绕如何在现有条件下搞好生产进行大鸣大放大辩论，批判了少数领导干部的“唯条件论”和“甘居中游”的保守思想。从各方面想办法充分利用大企业的有利条件，积极克服原料、燃料质量不好的困难，并且立即参照苏联和国内经验，采取技术措施，将临时配电盘换成能够高压操作的自动化配电盘，变常压操作为高压操作。工人们为了缩短变常压为高压的时间，仔细地检修了各项设备，使瓦斯不再跑掉，增加炉温。炉前工人也纷纷提出保证书，做到“困难留自己，方便给别人”，班与班、组与组、人与人之间掀起红旗竞赛，相互协作保证安全生产。
    10月28日，一号高炉开始倒盘，一千多名由各工种工人组成的劳动大军，只用二十七个小时就把临时配电盘换成自动化配电盘，比原计划提前两天。接着一号高炉职工又进行高压操作的试验，通常，把高炉从常压变到高压，要有三个月以上的时间，可是一号高炉仅以一个星期的时间就完成了。11月15日，炉顶压力就提高到零点八公斤，风量加到二千四百立方公尺，冶炼强度提高了，产铁量迅速跃升到二千二百一十四吨。从采用高压操作以来，铁口、渣口都保护得很好，没有发生过事故，出铁出渣也很及时。
    工人们为了多出铁，还从各方面想办法争取时间。在高温作业的条件下换一个风口，过去要十五分钟，现在像张如璞等工人已经创造了六分钟换一个的新纪录。在提高焦炭质量方面，他们也想了许多办法。焦化厂没有洗煤场，工人们就在运输皮带旁拣石头。配煤车间有一条又宽又高的皮带，速度很快，石头很难拣，工人们经过集体研究，在皮带上加了一块铁篦，使大块石头不漏下去，就提高了拣石头的效率。工人李淑范等为了避免搞乱配煤比例，影响焦炭质量，就拿着铁棍子细致地把配煤盘、皮带机上积下来的旧煤清除出来。甲班党小组长蔡宗贵还用四天半的时间研究出一种土法洗煤设备，不久就可以进行洗煤。
    许多领导干部都走出办公室深入下层，炼铁厂的厂长，现在都昼夜轮流到班，指挥生产，随时解决技术问题。工人们反映：现在有问题马上能解决，干活就更加有劲了。
