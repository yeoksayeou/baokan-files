Visiting "Ants Gnawing at a Bone"
    Chen Yi

    The Korean government delegation, along with us,
    Visited the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory.
    This factory is a combination of five small factories,
    It manufactures large products, famous for ants gnawing at a bone.

    Comrade Premier Kim said:
    I heard about the method of ants gnawing at a bone in Korea.
    This time I came to China,
    I want to find the trick to this method on the spot!

    The Korean comrades were first welcomed by the entire factory upon arrival.
    The masses cheered to pay tribute to the Korean government delegation!
    Comrade Premier asked the Party Branch Secretary, the Factory Director and the workers,
    What is ants gnawing at a bone?

    The answer was: it is small factories and small machines manufacturing large parts,
    It is using indigenous methods to manufacture modern machine products,
    It is starting from small parts and finally assembling the large parts.

    This saves construction funds,
    Fully utilizes new and old technologies,
    Fully utilizes all waste products,
    More importantly, it gives full play to the enthusiasm of all employees,
    Maximizing their drive.

    Do you have engineers?
    The answer was no engineers, only eight veteran workers.
    How long have they been working?
    All of them have been working for more than thirty years,
    This strength is probably better than engineers.

    Do you have design drawings?
    The answer was: we also make some sketches, and manufacture at the same time,
    After several iterations, we can also reach the qualified standard.

    Comrade Premier praised:
    This is one aspect of China's Great Leap Forward!
    Look, there are no factory buildings here,
    Mechanical manufacturing is carried out in the open air.
    This is a poor method, this is a scientific method.
    Since China can do it,
    Korea can certainly learn from it!

    Comrade Premier also asked:
    What was your output value last year?
    Answer: Seventy thousand yuan last year.
    What about this year?
    Seven million and change.
    What about next year?
    Provisionally set at seventeen million yuan.

    I interjected: "Isn't that a bit too much?"
    Comrade Premier said: "This is not too much, this is the Great Leap Forward!"
    The workers said in unison: "We will also
    overfulfill the target next year!"

    I hurriedly shouted:
    "My conservative opinion,
    Is to advocate a Great Leap Forward on the basis of implementation!"

    Dozens of guests and hosts burst into hearty laughter!

    Comrade Premier said to me:
    The method of this factory is very good,
    It can indeed break superstitions.
    Others may be able to survive without doing it,
    Korea and China are both poor, we can't survive without doing it.

    I cheered, Comrade Premier,
    You revealed the essence of the problem,
    We must fight against our own inertia.
    If one day we become rich,
    I'm afraid we will still have to keep making revolution.

    After the visit, I understood the trick of ants gnawing at a bone,
    This is just as moving as the ancient story of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.
    Writing down this visit,
    I wonder if I have expressed a few points of truth?
    I disregard my shallowness and dedicate this article to the distinguished Korean guests and the Chinese workers of the Great Leap Forward.

    参观“蚂蚁啃骨头”
    陈毅
    朝鲜政府代表团和我们一起，
    参观了上海建设机器厂。
    这个厂是五个小厂合成，
    它制造大产品，以蚂蚁啃骨头著名。
    金首相同志说：
    我在朝鲜就听见蚂蚁啃骨头这个办法。
    这次到中国来，
    想从现场找这个办法的窍门！
    朝鲜同志到场首先受着全厂的欢迎。
    大众欢呼向朝鲜政府代表团致敬！
    首相同志问了党支书，问了厂长和工人，
    什么是蚂蚁啃骨头？
    答说：就是小厂小机器制造大部件，
    就是用土办法制造现代机器产品，
    就是从小件做起，最后把大件组成。
    这样节省了建设资金，
    充分利用了新旧技术，
    充分利用了一切废品，
    更重要发挥了全体职工的干劲，
    把干劲发挥到最大可能。
    你们有没有工程师？
    答说没有工程师，只有八个老工人。
    他们工龄多少？
    都在三十年以上，
    这就是力量恐怕比工程师还行。
    你们有没有设计图？
    答说：我们也搞些草图，一面制造，
    几次反复也能达到够格的标准。
    首相同志称赞说：
    这就是中国大跃进的一面！
    你看这儿没有厂房，
    在露天就进行机械制造。
    这是穷办法，这是合乎科学的办法。
    中国既然可以做，
    朝鲜当然可以借镜！
    首相同志又问：
    你们去年产值多少？
    答，去年七十万元。
    今年呢？
    七百万有零。
    明年呢？
    暂定千七百万元。
    我插嘴说：“是不是有点冒了？”
    首相同志说：“这不冒，这是大跃进！”
    工人齐声说：“我们明年还
    要超额完成！”
    我急忙呼叫：
    “我这点带保守的意见，
    是主张在落实的基础之上大跃进！”
    宾主几十人发出爽朗的笑声！
    首相同志向我说：
    这个厂的办法很好，
    确实能破除迷信。
    别人不干也许可以过活，
    朝鲜和中国都穷，不干可不行。
    我欢呼，首相同志，
    你揭露了问题本质，
    我们要与自己的惰性作斗争。
    假如有一天我们富裕起来，
    恐怕也还要不断革命。
    参观完毕，我了解了蚂蚁啃骨头的窍门，
    这与愚公移山的古老故事同样动人。
    写下这次参观，
    不知道是不是表达出了几分真情？
    我不计浅陋，把这一篇献给朝鲜贵宾和大跃进的中国工人。
