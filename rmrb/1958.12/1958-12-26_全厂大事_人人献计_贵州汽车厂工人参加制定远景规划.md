A Major Event for the Entire Factory: Everyone Contributes Ideas
    Workers at the Guizhou Automobile Factory Participate in Formulating Long-Term Plans
    According to a report in the Guizhou Daily, the Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Factory is mobilizing all its employees to participate in discussing the factory's long-term plan, the factory expansion design, and how to solve the equipment problems for producing automobiles in large quantities next year.
    At the end of November, the Automobile Manufacturing Factory completed its annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeded its target. In order to prepare for next year's production as early as possible and to achieve a greater leap forward in production next year, the factory Party committee immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the factory Party committee to summarize the implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" in the enterprise. The factory Party committee mentioned the following four points in its summary: First, an unprecedented great leap forward has occurred in production. The entire factory completed its annual plan one month ahead of schedule and exceeded its target. The total industrial output value increased nearly four times compared with the same period last year. There has also been a leap in technology, enabling an automobile repair and parts enterprise to enter the automobile manufacturing industry. Second, various cumbersome management procedures and reports have been greatly simplified. For example, in terms of plan formulation, it used to be "three down, one up," and "three announcements settled the case" (the planning section issued the plan to the workshop, the workshop issued it to the team, and the team discussed it before returning it to the planning section for synthesis, and then it was issued as the official plan). Now, the planning department goes deep into the workshop in advance to investigate and then works with the workshop workers to formulate the plan and settle it at once. Third, cadres' participation in labor has been exercised and effectively overcome the three isms; after workers participated in management, their sense of ownership has been greatly enhanced, they have learned the skills of managing enterprises, and they have taken the initiative to solve many production problems. A new atmosphere of mutual understanding and cooperation between cadres and workers has emerged throughout the factory. The summary also found some shortcomings: many rules and regulations have been abolished, but few have been established; the participation of cadres in labor and the participation of workers in management are still not balanced. Cadres' participation in labor in offices is not as good as in workshops, and technical personnel are not as good as administrative management cadres; at the same time, a complete set of methods has not yet been found; workers' participation in technical management is only the beginning, and is generally limited to participating in daily administrative management work. Therefore, the "three combinations" are not good enough.
    To this end, the factory Party committee decided to further mobilize all employees to conscientiously summarize the experience and lessons learned from implementing the industrial "constitution" in the previous stage, and to discuss the factory's production development plan through extensive airing of views, exposing problems, and debates. The preliminary plans for the equipment, labor organization, factory layout, process regulations, state investment, and capital construction required for production capacity will be disclosed to the masses for revision; afterwards, the existing management systems will be reviewed, and various forms and systems of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" will be gradually established. Through debate, the following issues must be resolved: How many automobiles will be produced in large quantities next year? What if there is not enough equipment to produce automobiles in batches? Should we wait to purchase a large amount of equipment from outside before producing automobiles, or should we rely on our own efforts and engage in specialized machine tools combining indigenous and foreign methods? In self-made equipment, should only technical personnel design it, or should workers also participate in the design? After these issues are resolved, all employees of the factory will also discuss: a series of issues such as the formulation of process regulations and the adjustment of labor organization after an automobile repair and parts factory is transformed into an enterprise that produces automobiles in batches.

    全厂大事  人人献计   
    贵州汽车厂工人参加制定远景规划
    据贵州日报消息  贵州汽车制造厂正在发动全厂职工参加讨论这个厂的远景规划，工厂扩建设计及如何解决明年生产大批汽车的设备问题。
    11月底，汽车制造厂提前、超额完成了今年年度计划，厂党委为了及早为明年的生产作好准备，使明年的生产来一个更大的跃进，立即召开了厂党委扩大会议，总结了两参一改三结合在本企业中的执行情况。厂党委在总结时提到如下四点：一、生产上出现空前未有的大跃进，全厂提前一月超额完成年度计划，工业总产值比去年同期提高近四倍。技术上也来了一个飞跃，使一个汽车修配企业跨入汽车制造企业。二、各种繁琐的管理手续、报表大量简化。例如，在计划编制方面，过去是“三下一上”、“三榜定案”（计划科把计划下达车间，车间又下达小组，小组讨论后再回到计划科综合，然后才作为正式计划下达），现在改为计划部门事先深入车间摸底，然后会同车间工人编制计划，一次定案。三、干部参加劳动，受到了锻炼，有效地克服了三个主义；工人们参加管理后，主人翁感大大提高，学会了管理企业的本领，主动解决许多生产中的问题。全厂出现了一种干部和工人互相体贴、相互协作的新风气。总结中也发现了一些缺点：规章制度废除的多，建立的少；干部参加劳动及工人参加管理还不平衡。干部参加劳动科室不如车间，技术人员不如行政管理干部；同时也还没有找出一套完整的办法；工人参加技术管理仅是开始，一般的限于参加日常行政管理工作。因此，“三结合”做得还不够好。
    为此，厂党委决定进一步发动全厂职工认真总结前段贯彻工业“宪法”的经验、教训，通过大鸣大放，讨论工厂生产发展规划，把生产能力所需的设备、劳动组织、厂房布置、工艺规程、国家投资、基本建设等初步方案向群众交底，让群众修改；之后，对现有的各项管理制度进行审查，逐步建立“两参一改三结合”的各种形式与制度。通过辩论，要解决如下问题：明年将大批生产汽车，年产量多少？生产成批汽车设备不足怎么办？是坐等向外购置了大批设备后生产汽车呢，还是自力更生、搞土洋结合的专门机床？在自制设备中是光由技术人员设计呢？还是工人也参加设计？在这些问题解决以后，全厂职工还将讨论：一个修配汽车的工厂转为成批生产汽车的企业后的工艺规程的制订和劳动组织的调整等一系列的问题。
