Rountree Wants to Eat Tomatoes
He Jun

It is reported that before the American conspirator and Assistant Secretary of State Rountree arrived in Baghdad, the tomatoes in the Baghdad market had already been snapped up by young people, prepared to "welcome" him. Rountree arrived in Baghdad, and the American ambassador gave a lavish banquet for him, with rich wines and delicacies, but Rountree couldn't eat anything! He fled from the airport to the embassy, gasping for breath, his mouth dry and his heart burning. He just wanted to eat some tomato and onion salad with chili. Every famous dish was on the table, but not this one. The ambassador quickly shouted to the chef, "Quick, bring the tomatoes!" The chef was troubled when he heard this and hurriedly said to the ambassador, "There are still a few onions, but the tomatoes in the market have already been sold out." Rountree became angry when he heard this and cursed, "This damn country! Even tomatoes are in short supply. Does America have to come and help it?" The chef was alarmed when he heard this and quickly said from the side:
	"Tomatoes were originally everywhere, but this morning they were snapped up by young people.
	Hearing that you were coming to Baghdad, everyone is angry and everyone is cursing. If you hadn't slipped away quickly, you would have already tasted Baghdad's tomatoes: whether they are sour, sweet, bitter, or spicy!" (Attached picture)
	Chef: Respectable sir, they have plenty of tomatoes if you want to eat them.

    朗特里想吃西红柿
    禾君
    据报道，美国阴谋家、助理国务卿朗特里到达巴格达之前，巴格达市场里的西红柿早被青年人抢购一空，准备用来“欢迎”他。朗特里到巴格达，美国大使欢宴他，名酒佳肴多丰富，朗特里哪里吃得下！他从机场逃到此，大使馆里喘喘气，口干舌燥心发烧，只想吃点西红柿洋葱沙
  辣子。席上名菜样样摆，就是没有这个菜，大使连忙喊厨师，“快把番茄端上来！”厨师一听作了难，忙向大使说一番：“洋葱倒还有几个，西红柿市场里早卖完。”朗特里听到脾气发，大骂：“这个鬼国家！连西红柿也缺货，难道要美国来援助它？”厨师听见着了慌，连忙一旁又开腔：
  “西红柿本来到处有，今早被青年人抢购一扫
  光。“听说您来巴格达，人人愤怒人人骂，要不是您溜得快，早已尝到巴格达的西红
  柿是酸是甜是苦还是
  辣！”（附图片）
    厨师：尊敬的先生，你想吃西红柿他们有的是。
