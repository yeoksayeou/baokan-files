    Bring up the next generation well
    Chen Yanjiao, Kindergarten Teacher, Xiabai Township, Jiang County, Shanxi Province

    In 1957, I returned home from Korea and joined in production. This spring, the cooperative was in the throes of a production upsurge and felt the lack of labor, but there were forty-odd young and middle-aged women who couldn't participate in field production because they were encumbered by children. Some women clamored, "The great leap forward in agricultural production, the children are too tiring to manage. I want to go to the fields to work, but I'm worried about leaving the children." At that time, I was very anxious and wanted to start a kindergarten, but a cooperative cadre said, "This is an old problem. In the past, the kindergartens were only hot for a few days." Soon, the county women's federation held an on-site kindergarten meeting in Sunwang Village, and I went to participate. After returning to the cooperative, I was as happy as if I had won a prize, and I ran to the cooperative management committee without even going home, but the cooperative director said, "We can't do it now, let's put it off for later." At this time, I was no longer willing to wait, so I ran to the Party branch secretary, who said, "Yanjiao, your enthusiasm is really good, you are worthy of being a League branch secretary! With the Party in charge for you, what are you afraid of? As long as it is beneficial to the people, do your best!"

    The news that a kindergarten was going to be established spread quickly, and most of the cooperative members supported it, but some people said, "We have failed several times in the past, and now we are going to do it again, it's just empty talk." Others said, "Children between the ages of three and seven can play by themselves, why use foreign methods?" The rumors made me very uncomfortable. The next day I went to the Party branch secretary again, reflected some of the misunderstandings of some people, and put forward a plan for running a kindergarten. The Party branch specially convened a branch committee to study it, approved my plan, and also had me introduce the experience of the Sunwang Village Kindergarten at the cooperative members' meeting, and also launched a debate on "Why should we run a kindergarten? Who should we rely on to run it?" The cooperative director examined his own conservative thinking. Woman Wang Shenlin said, "Everything the Communist Party does is for everyone, I am willing to send my three children to the kindergarten." Then, young women signed up one after another, and a total of twenty children were enrolled.

    At the beginning, I gathered the children together. If there was no house, I used my house. If there were no toys, I used sorghum stalks to weave some glasses, lotus lanterns, small cars, and kites. But the smaller children cried when they saw me as a stranger, and the older children didn't listen to instructions and fought. I endured my anger and took it slowly, combing the girls' hair and washing the boys' hands and faces. After three days, the children were no longer strangers to me, and they came without their mothers sending them. Later, I taught them to sing songs like "Socialism is good", "The General Line", "Kindergarten is really good" and short rhythmic verses. Half a month later, the children were obedient, and they could sing and say short rhythmic verses, and they could also tell the story of Mr. Dong Guo, and they would salute the elderly and call them Grandpa. In this way, those who originally had a try-and-see attitude also took the initiative to send their children to the kindergarten. In less than a month, all sixty-one children in the cooperative were enrolled in the kindergarten. In order to run the kindergarten well, the Party branch added two more teachers. The cooperative members also took the initiative to make furniture, slides, and swings for the kindergarten, and also bought more than one hundred toys.

    Although all the children were enrolled in the kindergarten, the problem of encumbering mothers had not been completely solved. Because it was a day-care center, mothers had to take care of their children's sleep at night after working all day, and they couldn't find time to participate in political and cultural studies. I thought, we should take care of the children's eating and sleeping! So I put forward this opinion, the Party branch agreed, and the parents welcomed it. Our three teachers moved the forty-one children aged three to seven to the collective dormitory. But it was really difficult at the beginning! We didn't sleep for the first three nights. If the children kicked off the quilt in the middle of the night, we would gently cover them. If some children cried for their mothers, we would pretend to be their mothers' voices and say, "Mom is here with you, why are you crying, go to sleep!" If one child cried loudly, all the children would wake up and respond. When I encountered such a child, I would quickly hold them in my arms and put them down after they fell asleep. It was only after five or six days that it got better. Now our kindergarten is like a primary school, and the children's lives and studies have various systems, such as getting up early to fold quilts, taking turns sweeping the floor, washing their faces and brushing their teeth, four meals a day, standing in line before meals to sing, washing hands, gargling, and all actions are directed by the class leader.

    Since the children entered the kindergarten, the attendance rate of women has reached 99%. In August alone, the mothers of forty-one children averaged twenty-six workdays per person, an increase of 71% compared to before. They said, "The kindergarten is really good! The children live well, and the mothers are at ease. Production and learning are more vigorous, and Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea!"

    把下一代教养好
    山西绛县下柏乡幼儿教师  陈彦蛟
    我在1957年从朝鲜复员回家参加生产。今年春上，社里大闹生产，感到劳动力不足，但却有四十多个青壮年妇女，因为孩子拖累不能参加田间生产。有些妇女嚷着：“农业生产大跃进，孩子累的不能行，有心下地去劳动，留下小孩不放心。”当时我很着急，想办幼儿园，可是碰到一个社干部说：“这是老问题，过去办了几天幼儿园，都是三天热。”不久，县妇联在孙王村召开了幼儿园现场会议，我去参加了。回社后，我像得了喜事一样，连家都未回就跑到了社管委会，可是社主任说：“现在不能办，往后放放再说吧。”这时我再也不愿等待了，就跑去找党支书，党支书说：“彦蛟你这股干劲真好，不愧是个团支书呀！有党给你作主，怕什么，只要对人民有利就尽力干吧！”
    要办幼儿园的消息很快传开了，大部分社员很拥护，可是也有人说：“过去办了几次都失败啦，现在又要搞，真是嘴上抹石灰白说哩。”还有人说：“三岁到七岁的孩子都会自己玩，何必来套洋办法。”风言风语听得我十分难受。第二天我又去找党支书，反映了有些人的一些误解，并且提出了办幼儿园的计划。党支部专门召开了支委会作了研究，批准我的计划，同时还在社员大会上，让我介绍了孙王村幼儿园经验，还开展了“为什么要办幼儿园？依靠谁来办”的辩论会。社主任检讨了自己的保守思想。妇女王神林说：“共产党办事哪件不是为大家，我愿将三个孩子送园。”接着，青年妇女们接二连三报名，共有二十个幼儿入园。
    开始，我把孩子们集合起来，没房子就在我的家，没玩具我就用高粱秸秆编些眼镜，莲花灯，小汽车，风筝。但是小些的孩子见我陌生就哭，大些的孩子也不听指挥，又打架。我忍着火气慢慢来，给女孩子梳梳发，给男孩子洗洗手脸。三天过去了，孩子见我不陌生了，不要妈送就来了。后来我就教他们学“社会主义好”、“总路线”、“幼儿园真正好”等歌子和小快板。半个月过去了，孩子们听话了，也会唱歌会说小快板，还会讲东郭先生故事，见了年老的敬个礼，唤声爷爷好。这样，原来抱着试试看的也主动把孩子送到幼儿园。不到一个月光景，全社六十一个幼儿全部入了园。党支部为了把幼儿园办好，又增加了二个教师。社员们也主动给幼儿园做家具、滑梯、秋千，还买了一百多件玩具。
    虽说幼儿全部入园，但是连累妈妈的问题，还未得到彻底解决。因为是日托，妈妈白天劳动一天，晚上还得关照孩子睡觉，抽不出功夫参加政治、文化学习。我就想，该把孩子们的吃饭，睡觉统统管起来才好呀！于是我把这个意见提出来，党支部很同意，家长们也很欢迎，我们三个教师就把三岁到七岁的四十一个幼儿搬到集体宿舍来住。可是开头真难坏啦！头三个晚上我们没睡过觉，孩子半夜蹬被，我们轻轻盖好，有的叫唤妈妈，我们就装着他妈妈的声音应一声：“妈妈和你作伴哭啥，睡吧！”要是有一个孩子大哭，全体幼儿准会惊醒呼应，遇到这样孩子我就赶紧抱到怀里，等睡着再放下。这样过了五、六天，才好了。现在我们的幼儿园像小学堂一样，幼儿的生活、学习，都有各种制度，如早起叠被子，轮流扫地，个人洗脸刷牙，每天四顿饭，饭前站队唱歌、洗手、漱口，一切行动都听班长指挥。
    从幼儿入园以来，妇女出勤达到99％。仅8月份一个月，四十一个幼儿的母亲平均每人做到二十六个劳动日，比原来提高71％。她们说：“幼儿园真是好！孩子生活过的好，当妈妈的也安心，生产学习更起劲，毛主席恩情比海深！”
