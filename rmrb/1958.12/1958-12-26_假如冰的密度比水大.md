What if Ice Were Denser Than Water...
    Mǐyáng

    In winter, when a lake freezes, the ice always floats on the surface, and even in the coldest weather, the bottom of the lake never completely freezes. This is because ice is less dense than water. But what if ice were denser than water? What would the world be like?

    The surface of the water starts to freeze, but it immediately sinks to the bottom. Then the surface continues to freeze. In this way, rivers and lakes would freeze "solid." Aquatic animals in the north would die out.

    In summer, the surface ice melts, but the ice at the bottom never melts, and the riverbed becomes shallower. As soon as there is a heavy rain, the river will immediately flood and submerge large tracts of fields. Building bridges would be incredibly difficult, because in addition to overcoming the raging floods, one would have to penetrate several meters of ice at the bottom of the river!

    Ice skating would also be impossible. Normally, water is denser and ice is less dense. When the ice surface is subjected to the pressure of the ice skate, its volume shrinks and its density increases accordingly (as if it were compressed tightly). In order to relieve the pressure, the ice has no choice but to turn into water. It is precisely because of this small amount of water that is produced which acts as a lubricant, that athletes can speed across the ice. If ice were denser than water, the above phenomenon would disappear completely, and standing on the ice would be no different from standing on a smooth slab of stone.

    假如冰的密度比水大……
    米扬
    冬天湖水上冻的时候，冰总是浮在表面的，气候再冷湖底也不会完全冻上，这是因为冰的密度比水小的缘故。可是，假如一旦冰的密度比水大，那世界将成一个什么样子了呢？
    水面开始结冰了，但它立即下沉到水底，于是水面又继续结冰。这样下去，江河湖沼都将冻成“实心”。北方的水生动物就将死绝了。
    到了夏天，表面的冰融化了，可是水底的冰却常年不化，河床变浅了，只要下一场大雨，河水就会立即泛滥起来，淹没成片的田野。建大桥将会无比的艰难，除了要克服汹涌的洪水以外，还得要击穿河底好几公尺厚的冰层哩！
    滑冰运动也不行了。因为平常水的密度大，冰的密度小，冰面受到冰刀的压力，体积就缩小了，相应的密度就要增大（这就好像被压得紧密了一样），冰为了解脱外力的压迫，就只好变成水了。就因为随时有这点水产生，起了润滑作用，才使得运动员们能在冰面上飞驰。假如一旦冰的密度比水大，上面这样的现象就完全没有了，我们站在冰上就会和站在光滑的石板上一般无二。
