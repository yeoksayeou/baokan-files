Changes in Damao Mountain (Pictures)

Last winter, Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led more than 500 cadres to Damao Mountain. At that time, Damao Mountain was still a desolate place overgrown with brambles. After a year of hard work by the transferred cadres, Damao Mountain has changed. The transferred cadres happily sang: "Valleys have become tree-lined paths, newly built roads extend in all directions, wooden rail trains run back and forth, industrial flowers are blooming, the sound of motors is booming, there are factories everywhere on the mountain, Gancaowu is a good pasture, cattle and sheep graze in herds all over the hills, like ten thousand flowers blooming, newly built houses stand row upon row." This song movingly sings of Damao Mountain's appearance today.

Now many cadres have moved their families to the mountain, and they are determined to dedicate their youth to the great cause of building the mountainous area.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Houmin photographed:

　　The fragrant plum wine produced by the transferred cadres using wild plants has become a first-class export wine. This is a scene of the cadres of the fragrant plum wine factory preparing spices.

　　In the past, this place was covered with thorns and weeds, but now comfortable auditoriums and dormitories have been built.

　　Since the cadres came to the mountain, they have felled more than one million bamboo and wood. This is a scene of transporting the felled Mao bamboo to other places.

　　The transferred cadres have cultivated more than 500 mu of fruit trees, planted more than 100 mu of vegetables, and afforested 3,875 mu. In the early morning, the transferred cadres are working in the vegetable garden.

　　The fine-wool sheep from faraway Xinjiang have become accustomed to living in Damao Mountain. The transferred cadres have established a livestock farm and are vigorously breeding cattle and sheep.

    大茅山的变化（图片）
    去年冬天，中共江西省委书记方志纯同志率领五百多名干部上了大茅山。那时大茅山上还是荒无人烟、荆棘丛生，经过下放干部一年的辛勤劳动，大茅山已变了样。下放干部愉快地唱道：山谷变成林荫道，新修公路通四方，木轨火车来回跑，工业花朵齐开放，马达声音轰轰响，山上到处有工厂，甘草坞是好牧场，牛羊成群满山坡，好像万朵花儿放，新修住宅行对行。这歌声动人地唱出了大茅山今天的模样。
    现在许多干部已把家搬上山，他们决心把青春献给建设山区的伟大事业。

    下放干部利用野生植物生产的香梅酒已成为出口的第一流佳酒。这是香梅酒厂的干部们正在配制香料的情形。
    过去这里是荆棘乱草，现在已盖起舒适的礼堂和宿舍。
    干部们上山以后，已经砍伐了一百多万根竹木。这是把已砍伐好的茅竹运往外地的情形。
    下放干部栽培了五百多亩果树，种了一百多亩蔬菜，还造林三千八百七十五亩。清晨，下放干部就在蔬菜园里劳动了。
    来自遥远的新疆的细毛种羊，已在大茅山生活得很习惯了。下放干部办起了牧畜厂，大力繁植牛羊。
