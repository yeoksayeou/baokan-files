Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: China's petroleum industry has achieved a tremendous harvest. Crude oil production completed the state plan and the Great Leap Forward plan eighty-eight days and nineteen days ahead of schedule, respectively. The annual output for 1958 is estimated to reach approximately 2.23 million tons, exceeding the state plan by 48%. Drilling footage also completed the state plan of 800,000 meters three months ahead of schedule. Drilling footage for 1958 is estimated to reach over 1.6 million meters, surpassing the total drilling footage in the eight years since liberation. In 1958, a total of twenty-two new oil and gas fields were discovered, expanding the number of oil and gas fields in China to forty-one. This is one and a half times the number of oil and gas fields found in the previous eight years.

In 1958, natural oil exploration launched a mass movement centered on increasing drilling speed. A wave of competition unfolded between exploration areas, drilling teams, and individuals. "Trampling across the Junggar, drilling through the Gobi Desert," and "Records improving daily, production increasing monthly" became the battle slogans of the drilling workers. In 1957, there were no drilling teams that advanced a thousand meters in a month, while in 1958, there were 442 instances of teams advancing over a thousand, two thousand, three thousand, or four thousand meters per month. The Sichuan Nie Wenhai Drilling Team created a national record of 6,336 meters in one month. Up to November, the national average monthly drilling speed for exploration wells was 622 meters, and for production wells, it was 1,432 meters, both more than double the speed in 1957. In terms of the discovery of oil and gas fields, the Lenghu and Shizigou areas in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai have been confirmed as high-yield oil fields. The area of the Karamay Oilfield in Xinjiang expanded sevenfold in 1958. The Jiuquan Basin in Gansu is an old oil-producing area, and several new high-yield oil fields have been found around it through drilling. New oil-producing areas have also been found in central Sichuan. In 1958, a large exploration network was also launched, conducting exploration work in vast areas such as Songliao, North China, northern Jiangsu, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, both sides of the Yangtze River, and the suburbs of Shanghai. In some places, crude oil or natural gas has already been extracted during the drilling process, and oil sands or oil and gas shows have been discovered in many areas.

The scale of capital construction in the petroleum industry was enormous in 1958. Petroleum industrial zones with tens of thousands of people have emerged in the once desolate Gobi Desert. Some areas have formed "oil cities." The Northwest Refinery, with highly mechanized and automated equipment and an annual refining capacity of over one million tons of crude oil, was also completed and put into production at the end of September 1958, producing various high-grade oil products for the country. The construction of other oil fields and synthetic oil plants is also progressing rapidly.

The petroleum industry's "small indigenous groups" developed rapidly in 1958. In just a few months, more than 1,400 small synthetic petroleum factories have been built across the country. These small oil factories mostly use low-temperature distillation of coal or shale to produce crude oil, with simple equipment and easy construction. A farm tool factory in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, which had only four old belt lathes and a small drill press, contracted to manufacture all the equipment for more than 100 small synthetic petroleum factories in the county. Many small oil factories are run by people's communes. (Attached picture)

### 石油工业一跃千里  钻井进尺大过前八年总和  原油产量超过计划近一半

    石油工业一跃千里
    钻井进尺大过前八年总和
    原油产量超过计划近一半
    新华社29日讯  我国石油工业获得巨大丰收。原油生产分别提前八十八天和十九天完成了国家计划和跃进计划，1958年全年产量可达二百二十三万吨左右，超过国家计划48％。钻井进尺也提前三个月完成了八十万公尺的国家计划，1958年钻井进尺可达一百六十万公尺以上，超过解放八年来钻井进尺的总和。1958年共获得新的油、气田二十二个，这使我国油、气田扩大到四十一处。为以往八年所找到油、气田的一倍半。
    1958年，天然油勘探方面，开展了以提高钻井速度为中心的群众运动，探区与探区，钻井队与钻井队，个人与个人之间展开竞赛热潮。“踏遍准噶尔，钻透戈壁滩”，“纪录日日新，产量月月高”成了钻探工人的战斗口号。1957年没有一个月进千公尺的井队，而1958年月进上千尺，月进双千、三千、四千公尺以上的井队就有四百四十二队次。四川聂文海钻井队创造了月进六千三百三十六公尺的全国最高纪录。到11月份为止，全国十一个月平均钻机月速度探井为六百二十二公尺，生产井为一千四百三十二公尺，都比1957年提高一倍以上。在油、气田的发现方面，青海柴达木盆地的冷湖、狮子沟已被证实是高产量油田。新疆克拉玛依油田面积1958年扩大了七倍。甘肃酒泉盆地是一个老油区，经过钻探又在周围找到了好几个新的高产油田。在四川中部也找到了新的石油产区。1958年还撒开了勘探大网，在松辽、华北、江苏北部、宁夏回族自治区、长江两岸及上海市郊等广大地区进行了勘探工作，有些地方在钻探过程中已喷出原油或天然气，许多地区发现了油沙或油气苗。
    1958年石油工业基本建设规模巨大。过去荒无人烟的戈壁滩上已出现拥有数万人口的石油工业区。有的地区已形成了“石油城”。拥有高度机械化、自动化设备，年炼一百万吨以上原油的西北炼油厂，也在1958年9月底建成投入生产，为国家生产各种高级油品。其它油田、人造油厂的建设，进展也很快。
    石油工业“小土群”1958年飞跃发展，短短数月，全国已兴建了一千四百多个小型人造石油工厂。这些小石油厂大都采用煤或页岩低温干馏方法生产原油，设备简单，建设容易。吉林省农安县一个只有四部旧皮带车床和一台小钻床的农具厂，就包制了全县一百多个小型人造石油厂的全部设备。许多小石油厂是人民公社举办的。（附图片）
