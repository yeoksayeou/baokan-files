    Workers Participate in Management, Cadres Greatly Reduced
    Liulihe Cement Plant Achieves Success in Implementing "Two Participations, One Reform"
    (Reported by this newspaper) As a result of the Liulihe Cement Plant's conscientious implementation of "Two Participations, One Reform," unprecedented new developments have emerged in production and management.
    Currently, factory-level cadres in this plant are participating in labor for half a day every day, and workshop cadres are participating in labor full-time; workers are widely participating in all aspects of management. After workers participated in management, management work not only did not become "chaotic," but efficiency became even higher. In terms of production, in the past, it was stipulated that full-time workshop accountants should announce the output to workers on time, but in reality, it was often not timely, sometimes delayed for several days. Now, the workers calculate it themselves, and it can be announced immediately. In terms of wages, in the past, there were full-time labor and wage personnel who used attendance books to calculate, and there were often quarrels and account searching when paying wages every month. Now, the workers keep their own attendance and calculate, which not only avoids this phenomenon, but also makes wage distribution very timely. In terms of materials, after the workers plan and manage themselves, they pay more attention to conservation. The sintering workshop was implementing dust elimination measures and was short of a piece of oil felt. The worker in charge of materials was reluctant to spend a few dozen yuan to buy some, and finally solved the problem with broken sacks coated with asbestos powder. The workers said, "You don't know the cost of firewood and rice until you're in charge."
    The workers' participation in management has laid a solid foundation for cadres to participate in labor, and has further streamlined the management structure, greatly reducing the number of full-time personnel. Currently, this factory has only three functional departments at the factory level: the director's office, the personnel section, and the security section. With workers participating in management, the amount of work that full-time cadres need to do in each workshop has been greatly reduced. This factory originally had fifty-eight workshop cadres. After implementing the "Two Participations, One Reform," it was reduced to eighteen people, and the number of workshop management cadres only accounts for slightly more than 19% of the workers.
    After the cadres of this factory participated in labor, the measures to ensure the normal progress of business work at the factory level are: 1. Further reform the rules and regulations, improve working methods, reduce unnecessary work procedures, and improve work efficiency. For example, the finance team in the factory director's office merged the past eighty-four accounting subjects into twenty-five, and used tables, reports, and documents instead of accounts, greatly reducing registration procedures. In terms of personnel reports, the labor ten-day report system was abolished and changed to reporting only once a month. This greatly reduces the time cadres spend on their own business work, creating conditions for half-day labor. 2. Rationally arrange the time for meetings and various activities. Except in special circumstances, meetings or other collective activities are generally not held during the time when cadres are participating in labor. Workshop cadres participate in labor full-time. The ways they carry out their own work are: first, to pay attention to understanding the situation and solving problems in a timely manner during labor; second, to take a small amount of time to handle daily work that cannot be carried out during labor in their spare time.

### 工人参加管理  干部大大减少  琉璃河水泥厂贯彻“两参一改”有成效

    工人参加管理  干部大大减少
    琉璃河水泥厂贯彻“两参一改”有成效
    本报讯  琉璃河水泥厂认真贯彻“两参一改”的结果，在生产、管理工作上出现了前所未有的新气象。
    这个工厂的厂级干部目前已经做到每天半日参加劳动，车间干部整日参加劳动；工人广泛参加了各方面的管理工作。工人参加管理后，管理工作不但没有“乱”，效率反而更高了。在生产方面，过去规定由车间专职核算员按时向工人公布产量，但实际上往往不及时，有时拖拉几天。现在都是由工人自己算，当时就可以公布。工资方面，过去有专职劳资员，拿着签到簿进行计算，每月发工资经常吵嘴，找账。现在由工人自己考勤计算，不但避免了这种现象，而且发放工资非常及时。在材料方面，由工人自己计划和管理以后，更重视节约。烧成车间搞消灭粉尘措施，缺一块油毡，只花几十元钱，管材料的工人舍不得花，最后用破麻袋涂石棉粉解决了。工人说：“不当家不知柴米贵”。
    工人参加管理为干部参加劳动打下了巩固的基础，并且使管理机构进一步紧缩，专职人员大大减少。现在这个工厂厂一级只有厂长办公室、人事科、保卫科三个职能科室。工人参加管理，各车间需要专职干部做的事情大为减少。这个厂原来是五十八个车间干部，推行两参一改后，又减为十八人，车间管理干部人数只占工人的19％多一点。
    这个工厂干部参加劳动后，厂一级干部保证业务工作正常进行的办法是：一、进一步改革规章制度，改进工作方法，减少不必要的工作手续，提高工作效率。如厂长办公室内的财务组，将过去的八十四个会计科目合并为二十五个，并且以表报、单据代账，大大减少了登记手续。人事表报方面取消了劳动旬报制度，改为每月只报一次。这就使干部从事本身业务工作的时间大为减少，为半日劳动创造了条件。二、合理安排会议和各种活动的时间，在干部参加劳动的时间内，除特殊情况外一般不召开会议或进行其他集体活动。车间干部是整日参加劳动，他们进行本身工作的办法，一是在劳动中及时注意了解情况解决问题；一是抽一小部分时间，在劳动之余处理在劳动中不能进行的日常工作。
