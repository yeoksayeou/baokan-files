Xinhua News Agency, 10th — The Third National Congress of the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) was held in Beijing from November 17th to December 9th.

	During the congress, all delegates, combining the study of Chairman Mao's literature on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," the issue of People's Communes, and the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, conducted in-depth discussions on the domestic and international situations and received profound education on the situation. Wang Shao'ao, Vice-Chairman of the CAPD, delivered a work report on behalf of the Fourth Central Committee at the meeting, and Vice-Chairman Che Xiangchen gave a report on the organizational transformation plan. After discussion, the congress adopted the work report of the Central Committee and the organizational transformation plan. After extensive discussions and debates, the delegates unanimously recognized that the CAPD is still a bourgeois political party today, and most of its members are still bourgeois intellectuals, and must continue to accelerate the fundamental transformation of the organization and its members. The congress decided that the future direction and tasks of the CAPD are: under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to accelerate the fundamental transformation of the organization and its members, to break with the capitalist standpoint, establish a socialist standpoint, and continue to deeply engage in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; actively participate in the cultural revolution, the technological revolution, and the people's commune movement, promote the communist spirit, and accelerate the construction of socialism. The congress also believed that the main ways for members' transformation are: under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with political thought as the command, with socialist work posts as the base, and with participation in professional practice and labor practice as the foundation.

	The congress passed a resolution stating that the vast majority of CAPD members have made varying degrees of progress through the anti-Rightist struggle and general rectification, but they must continue to carry out fundamental self-transformation in order to better serve socialism. The transformation of the political stand and ideological consciousness of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is a long-term, arduous, and repetitive process. The resolution pointed out that as long as people recognize that our country's path to socialism is the inevitable law of social development, recognize this inevitability, and obey this inevitability, then accelerating fundamental self-transformation, accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, and dedicating oneself to the cause of socialist construction will become people's free will and a pleasant thing. Anyone who violates this inevitability and rejects this inevitability will inevitably be abandoned by the ever-advancing train of the times.

	The congress concluded with a closing speech by Xu Guangping. She said: This congress is a congress for conducting education on the situation, a congress for promoting fundamental self-transformation, and a congress for unity. In her closing speech, Xu Guangping expressed her heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China for its concern and leadership of the congress. Xu Guangping finally encouraged everyone to transform themselves with the spirit of "learn as long as you live, study as long as you live, transform as long as you live."

	Before the closing of the congress, Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao, Zhou Jianren and seventy-three others were elected as members of the Fifth Central Committee, and Mao Zhifen and twenty-eight others were elected as alternate members of the Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th — The first plenary session of the Fifth Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy was held today to elect the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and Standing Committee members of the Central Committee. The meeting elected Ma Xulun as Chairman, Wang Shao'ao, Zhou Jianren, Xu Guangping, Che Xiangchen, and Yang Dongchun as Vice-Chairmen, and Fang Ming, Yan Jingyao, Wu Ruo'an, Wu Yan Yin, Wu Yifang, Chen Lijie, Chen Qiu'an, Jin Tongyin, Zhao Puchu, Ke Ling, Xu Boxin, Xu Chubo, Xu Chongqing, Liang Chunfu, Zhang Mingyang, Zhang Jiyuan, Feng Binfu, Yang Shixian, Lei Jieqiong, Ge Zhicheng, Xie Bingxin, Lin Handa, and Jin Zhixuan as members of the Central Standing Committee. The meeting also appointed Xu Boxin as Secretary-General, and Feng Binfu, Ge Zhicheng, and Zhang Jiyuan as Deputy Secretaries-General.

    一个促进自我根本改造的大会
    民进全国代表大会闭幕
    选出马叙伦为主席  王绍鏊等五人为副主席
    新华社10日讯  中国民主促进会第三次全国代表大会11月17日到12月9日在北京举行。
    大会期间，全体代表结合学习毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献、人民公社问题和党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，对国内外形势进行了深入的讨论，受到了深刻的形势教育。民进副主席王绍鏊代表第四届中央委员会在会上作了工作报告，副主席车向忱作了组织改造规划的报告。经过讨论，大会通过了中央委员会的工作报告和组织改造规划。参加大会的代表经过鸣放辩论，一致认识到民进在今天仍是资产阶级性的政党，大多数成员仍是资产阶级知识分子，必须继续加速进行组织和成员的根本改造。大会决定民进今后的方针和任务是：在中国共产党领导下，加速进行组织和成员的根本改造，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，继续深入政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命；积极参加文化革命、技术革命和人民公社化运动，发扬共产主义精神，加速建设社会主义。大会还认为成员改造的主要途径是：在中国共产党领导下，以政治思想为统帅，以社会主义工作岗位为基地，以参加业务实践和劳动实践为基础。
    大会通过决议说，民进的绝大多数成员经过反右派斗争和一般整风，都有不同程度的进步，但是必须继续进行自我根本改造，才能更好地为社会主义服务。而资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子政治立场和思想意识的改造是一个长期的、艰巨的、反复的过程。决议指出，只要人们认识到我们国家走社会主义道路是社会发展的必然规律，认识这个必然性、服从这个必然性，那么，加速进行自我根本改造，接受共产党的领导，献身于社会主义建设事业，就成为人们的自由意志，成为心情舒畅的事情。任何人违反这个必然性，拒绝这个必然性，就必将为不断前进的时代列车所抛弃。
    大会最后由许广平致闭幕词。她说：这次大会是一个进行形势教育的大会，一个促进自我根本改造的大会，一个团结的大会。许广平在闭幕词中衷心感谢中国共产党对大会的关怀和领导。许广平最后勉励大家以“做到老，学到老，改造到老”的精神来改造自己。
    大会闭幕前选出了马叙伦、王绍鏊、周建人等七十六人为第五届中央委员会委员，毛之芬等二十九人为候补中央委员。
    新华社10日讯  中国民主促进会第五届中央委员会今天举行第一次全体会议，进行中央委员会主席、副主席、常务委员的选举。会议选举马叙伦为主席，王绍鏊、周建人、许广平、车向忱、杨东莼为副主席，方明、严景耀、吴若安、吴研因、吴贻芳、陈礼节、陈秋安、金通尹、赵朴初、柯灵、徐伯昕、徐楚波、许崇清、梁纯夫、张明养、张纪元、冯宾符、杨石先、雷洁琼、葛志成、谢冰心、林汉达、金芝轩等为中央常务委员。会议还选任徐伯昕为秘书长，冯宾符、葛志成、张纪元为副秘书长。
