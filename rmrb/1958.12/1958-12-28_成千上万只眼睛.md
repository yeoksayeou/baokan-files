    “Tens of Thousands of Eyes”
    Miao Sun
    It seems that the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has indeed severely stung the hearts of many Western gentlemen, to the point of driving them near to madness and incoherence. For example, a United Press reporter named Roy Essoyan, after continuing to babble about how people's communes are "eliminating individual freedom, private life, and personality," cleverly found a sentence in a Chinese newspaper to prove his point. That sentence is, "Tens of thousands of eyes are watching over the interests of the commune."
    Wonderful, Mr. Reporter's argument. It seems his intention was probably to use it to prove the "lack of freedom" or "lack of personality" of Chinese peasants, but the result goes exactly the opposite way. This quote is excellent. Tens of thousands of eyes watching over the interests of the commune, everyone caring about the collective, caring about this paradise built with their own hands, is precisely the common situation in today's people's communes. This situation can only occur in a socialist country where the people are truly the masters. But in the Western world? A handful of war criminals are watching military maps, watching those fertile lands they can no longer arbitrarily exploit, their mouths watering in vain. In New York and Chicago, tens of thousands of unemployed and destitute people can only blankly stare at their broken rice bowls, stare at their emaciated and dying children. Peasants in Japan or other enslaved countries are staring at their shattered homes, which have been turned into American military bases. Isn't this the reality?
    This reporter lives in Hong Kong, which is only a stone's throw away from mainland China. It wouldn't be difficult to find out what the people's commune is all about. Unfortunately, since he makes his living by spreading rumors, he naturally doesn't want to open his eyes more, and is busy fabricating lies every day in a fit of pique, just to collect his reward.

    “成千上万只眼睛”
    苗隼
    看来，党中央八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”确乎狠狠刺痛了许多西方老爷们的心，以致使他们近于疯狂，语无伦次了。例如有个美联社记者叫罗伊·埃索扬的人，在继续胡扯了一通人民公社“正在消灭个人自由、私生活和个性”之后，又自作聪明地从中国报纸上找到一句话，来证明他的论点。这句话是“成千上万只眼睛正在注视着公社的利益。”
    妙哉，这位记者先生之论证也。看来他的本意大约是很想拿来证明中国农民的“不自由”或“没有个性”的，可是结果恰恰走到它的反面。这句话引用得太好了。成千上万只眼睛注视着公社的利益，人人都关心集体，关心着这个亲手建成的乐园，正是今天人民公社里的普遍情况。这种情况，只有在人民真正当了主人的社会主义国家，才能出现。而在西方世界呢？一小撮战争罪犯们的眼睛正在注视着军用地图，注视着那些不再能任意宰割的肥美土地，空自垂涎三尺；纽约和芝加哥成千上万的失业者、贫苦无依的人们，只能失神地注视着自己的破饭碗，注视着骨瘦如柴、奄奄一息的孩子。日本或者别的被奴役的国家的农民注视着变成了美军军事基地的破碎的家园。事实不正是这样么？
    这位记者身居香港，算得离中国大陆只是咫尺之遥，要想弄清楚人民公社是怎么一回事，也并不难。可惜他既以造谣为业，当然也就并不想多开开眼界，每天气急败坏地编造些谎言，就忙着领赏去了。
