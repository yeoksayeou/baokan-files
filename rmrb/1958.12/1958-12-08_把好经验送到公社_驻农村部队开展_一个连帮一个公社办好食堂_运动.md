Xinhua News Agency — Many units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in rural areas have recently launched a "One Company Helps One People's Commune Run a Good Canteen" movement. A large number of the army's mess hall administrators, quartermasters, and cooks have been sent to the people's commune canteens to pass on the army's experience in running canteens.

The main activity of the troops in helping the people's communes run their canteens is to train a group of canteen management cadres and cooks for the communes, and to impart experience in running good canteens. The methods used by the troops to help are mostly "soldier to soldier, officer to officer." The deputy company commander in charge of the army's mess helps the commune's canteen director, the army quartermaster helps the commune's quartermaster, and the cook helps the commune's cook. After arriving at the commune, they first help the canteen improve its organization, establish various systems, implement democratic management, and help the canteen vigorously improve its food. The army cooks who go to the commune to help often hold technical seminars with the commune cooks, or cook meals themselves. They teach as they cook, inspiring the commune cooks to use their brains and find ways to improve the variety of dishes. Zhang Pingshan, a cook from a certain unit, helped the commune canteen modify the stove overnight, which not only saved half the firewood, but also greatly shortened the cooking time. The rice in one commune's canteen was always poorly cooked. According to the army's experience, Zhang Rong, an army cook, made two rice steaming devices for the commune, which could cook more than 300 jin of rice in two hours, and the rice was fragrant and soft. Many troops have taken out their own canteen utensils to support the commune canteens. One canteen had too few pots and too many people, so the troops gave them a large pot, which shortened the cooking time and enabled the members to eat on time.

The canteens that have been helped by the troops have all undergone a new look. Those who had no experience in running canteens in the past now have it, those whose management work was not sound enough in the past now have someone in charge, and those who had waste in the past can now "calculate the rice according to the number of people," saving food and firewood. Some canteens have managed to make different dishes for every meal, and every meal is delicious and palatable. The members have composed clapper rhymes saying: "Young people eat canteen food, and carry Mount Tai to chase the sun; women eat canteen food, and become clever girls; workers eat canteen food, and smelt good steel in every furnace; old people eat canteen food, and live to be a hundred years old; children eat canteen food, and are lively and healthy."

    把好经验送到公社
    驻农村部队开展“一个连帮一个公社办好食堂”运动
    新华社讯  中国人民解放军驻农村的许多部队，最近开展了“一个连帮助一个人民公社办好食堂”运动。大批部队伙食管理员、事务长、炊事兵已被派到人民公社食堂，传授部队办食堂的经验。
    各部队帮助人民公社办好食堂的活动，主要是为公社培养一批食堂管理干部和炊事人员，传授办好食堂的经验。各部队帮助的方法，多半是“兵对兵，将对将”。管理部队伙食的副连长帮助公社的食堂主任，部队事务长帮助公社的事务长，炊事兵帮助公社的炊事员。他们到公社以后，首先是帮助食堂健全组织，建立各种制度，实行民主管理，帮助食堂大力改善伙食。到公社帮助工作的部队炊事兵，经常同公社炊事人员一起举行技术座谈会，或者亲自做饭做菜。边做边教，启发公社炊事人员开动脑筋，想办法改进饭菜花样。某部炊事兵张平山连夜帮助公社食堂改炉灶，不仅使烧柴节省一半，做饭时间也大大缩短了。有一公社食堂米饭总是做不好，部队炊事兵张荣根据部队的经验，为公社做了两个焖饭器，在两小时内就把三百多斤米饭做好，而且做得又香又软。许多部队抽出自己的食堂用具支援公社食堂。有一个食堂锅少人多，部队就送给他们一口大锅，缩短了做饭时间，使社员能够按时吃饭。
    经过部队帮助的食堂，面貌都是焕然一新。过去没有办食堂经验的现在有了，过去管理工作不够健全的现在有了专人负责，过去有浪费现象的现在都能“计人下米”，省粮省柴。有些食堂做到了顿顿花样不同，餐餐美味可口。社员们编快板说：“青年吃了食堂饭，挑起泰山赶太阳；妇女吃了食堂饭，个个变成巧姑娘；工人吃了食堂饭，炉炉炼出好钢铁；老人吃了食堂饭，长命百岁有希望；小孩吃了食堂饭，活泼伶俐又健康。”
