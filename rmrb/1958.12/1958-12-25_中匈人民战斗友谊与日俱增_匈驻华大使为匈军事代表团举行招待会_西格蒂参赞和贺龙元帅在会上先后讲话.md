Although our two countries are separated by vast mountains and rivers, our shared will and determination to build socialism, to safeguard the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defend lasting world peace, closely link us together, and the friendly and cooperative relations between us, like brothers, will surely grow day by day."
