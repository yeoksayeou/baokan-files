Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th - Khartoum News: The Sudanese Council of Ministers, at its meeting on the 29th, passed a declaration of Sudanese foreign policy, which was announced in Khartoum by Foreign Minister Ahmed Kheir. The statement declared: "The Sudanese Revolutionary Government, in accordance with the principles of the great Bandung Conference, from now on recognizes the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million and participated in drafting the Bandung Conference resolutions."

The statement said: "We, on our part, will strive to consolidate relations with the People's China."

The statement also said: "Sudan will sincerely implement the principles and purposes of the Bandung Conference and the Accra Conference, and will do its utmost to consolidate its relations with those countries that jointly made these two conferences successful and made them outstanding events in world politics."

The statement said that Sudan would strive to participate in the work for justice, freedom and peace. Sudan understands that peace means its obligation to defend the right of self-determination of all nations and peoples—such as the freedom of Algeria, Cyprus and Cameroon. The statement also said that Sudan understands that peace also means: not participating in military treaties, using science for the benefit of mankind and respecting man and human freedom, regardless of his religion, color or political beliefs.

The statement said that, therefore, Sudan does not approve of the arms race and nuclear tests for military purposes.

The statement discussed in detail Sudan's relations with Arab and African countries. The statement said that Sudan would strive to maintain relations between Sudan and Arab countries, especially the United Arab Republic, and that Sudan hopes to consolidate the Arab League.

The statement also said that Sudan feels a great responsibility towards African countries striving for independence, and is very keen to develop friendly relations with other African countries, especially Ethiopia. The statement expressed the hope that the people of African countries will cooperate on the international stage in accordance with the resolutions of the Accra Conference.

The statement said that Sudan will also consolidate its relations with all countries in the world.

Referring to economic policy, the statement said that Sudan welcomes foreign capital, whether it is government capital, company capital, or private capital. Sudan also welcomes loans from international organizations such as the World Bank and other United Nations organizations. Sudan will accept foreign aid from any country, as long as this foreign aid does not infringe upon Sudan's sovereignty or cause it to abandon its foreign policy. The statement said that because we need foreign aid and loans, we will not only welcome foreign aid and loans, but we will also strive to encourage them and seek convenience to attract them.

The statement pointed out that Sudan will conduct commercial exchanges with all countries on the basis of mutual benefit. The statement also said that Sudan will also develop cultural relations with other countries.

The Sudanese cabinet held meetings on the morning and evening of the 29th, presided over by Prime Minister Abboud.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to Agence France-Presse, Khartoum: In an official statement issued today, the new Sudanese government said that Sudan will adhere to a neutral policy, will not participate in military alliances, and will abide by the principles of non-interference in internal affairs formulated at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung and the African Independent States Conference held in Accra.

The statement announced that Sudan would accept economic aid from the United States. According to the statement, studies have shown that the economic aid previously given to Sudan by the United States does not infringe upon Sudan's independence or dignity. The statement said that Sudan needs 120 million pounds for construction in the next five years, but its own income is insufficient.

This statement by the Sudanese government was issued after a cabinet meeting, and Sudanese Radio broadcast it twice.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th - According to the Middle East News Agency from Khartoum, Sudanese Minister of Information Farid said in Khartoum today that Sudan's acceptance of aid from any country does not mean following its policies. He said, "If we feel that American aid will tie us to American policies, or affect our political measures, or serve as a means of exerting pressure on us, we will immediately reject such aid."

Farid said that the new Sudanese government agreed to the US "aid" agreement based on considerations different from those of the old Sudanese government. This agreement was signed in March this year.

Farid said that Sudanese merchants will not be allowed to apply for import licenses through the US technical "aid" agency as they did under the old regime, but must submit their applications to the Sudanese government, and then the Sudanese government will hand over their applications to the US technical "aid" agency. The Sudanese government will also decide on the construction projects to be built with US "aid" and will decide on the number and type of American experts. These experts will work under the supervision of the Sudanese government. The Sudanese government can terminate their contracts at any time.

    苏丹政府发表外交政策声明
    宣布承认我国  遵守中立政策
    新华社开罗30日电  喀土穆消息：苏丹部长会议29日会上通过、并由外交部长艾哈迈德·赫尔在喀土穆宣布的苏丹外交政策的声明中宣告：“苏丹革命政府按照伟大的万隆会议宗旨，从现在起承认拥有六亿人口、曾经参加起草万隆会议决议的中华人民共和国。”
    声明说：“我们这方面将努力巩固同人民中国的关系。”
    声明还说：“苏丹将真诚地执行万隆会议和阿克拉会议的原则和宗旨，并且将尽它的最大力量来巩固它同那些共同使这两个会议获得成功、并使它们成为世界政治中杰出事件的国家的关系。”
    声明说，苏丹将努力参加争取正义、自由和和平的工作。声明说，苏丹理解到，和平意味着它保卫各民族和各国人民的自决权——例如阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯和喀麦隆等的自由——的义务。声明又说，苏丹理解到，和平还意味着：不参加军事条约，利用科学为人类谋福利和尊重人以及人的自由、而不管他的宗教、肤色或政治信仰。
    声明说，因此，苏丹不赞成军备竞赛和为军事目的而进行的核试验。
    声明详细谈到苏丹同阿拉伯和非洲国家的关系。声明说，苏丹将努力保持苏丹同阿拉伯国家、特别是阿拉伯联合共和国之间的关系，而且苏丹希望巩固阿拉伯联盟。
    声明又说，苏丹感到对于争取独立的非洲国家负有重大的责任，而且很希望发展同其他非洲国家、特别是埃塞俄比亚之间的友好关系。声明表示希望非洲各国人民根据阿克拉会议的决议在国际舞台上实行合作。
    声明说，苏丹也将巩固同世界上所有国家的关系。
    谈到经济政策，声明说，苏丹欢迎外国资本，不管是政府的资本、还是公司的资本、还是私人的资本。苏丹还欢迎像世界银行及其他联合国组织这样一些国际组织的贷款。苏丹将接受来自任何国家的外援，只要这种外援不侵犯苏丹的主权或者使它背弃它的外交政策。声明说，由于我们需要外援和贷款，我们将不仅欢迎外援和贷款，而且我们将努力来鼓励它们并寻求方便来吸引它们。
    声明指出，苏丹将在互利的基础上同一切国家进行商业方面的来往。声明还说，苏丹还将发展同其他国家的文化关系。
    苏丹内阁29日上午和傍晚举行了会议，由阿布德总理主持。
    新华社30日讯  据法新社喀土穆消息：苏丹新政府在今天发表的一项官方声明中说，苏丹将遵守中立政策，不参加军事联盟，并且遵守在万隆举行的亚非会议和在阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议所制定的不干涉内政的原则。
    声明宣布，苏丹将接受美国的经济援助。据这项声明说，所作的研究表明美国先前给苏丹的经济援助并不侵犯苏丹的独立或尊严。声明说，苏丹在今后五年中需要一亿二千万镑用来进行建设，但它自己的收入不足。
    苏丹政府的这项声明是在内阁举行会议后发表的，苏丹电台曾两次加以广播。
    新华社开罗30日电  据中东通讯社发自喀土穆的消息说，苏丹宣传部长法里德今天在喀土穆说，苏丹接受任何国家的援助，并不意味着追随它的政策。他说，“如果我们觉得美援会把我们同美国的政策束缚在一起，或者影响我们的政治措施，或者作为对我们施加压力的一种手段的话，我们将立即拒绝这种援助。”
    法里德说，新的苏丹政府是根据同旧苏丹政府不同的考虑同意美国“援助”协定的。这项协定是在今年3月间签订的。
    法里德说，苏丹商人个人将不得像在旧政权下那样，通过美国技术“援助”机构申请进口许可证，而要向苏丹政府提出他们的申请书，然后再由苏丹政府把他们的申请书交给美国技术“援助”机构。苏丹政府还将由它决定用美“援”建设的工程项目，并且将决定美国专家的数目和种类。这些专家将在苏丹政府的监督下工作。苏丹政府可以随时中止他们的合同。
