Build the Building First or Engage in Production First?
Jilunzhai Commune Obtains Answer After Debate

    This newspaper reports that the Jilunzhai Commune in Woyang County, Anhui Province, carried out a debate, refuted the erroneous ideas of emphasizing ostentation and competing for extravagance, and implemented the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily.

    The Jilunzhai People's Commune is a large commune with more than 22,000 households and over 90,000 people. After the commune was established in late September this year, cadres and members alike were overjoyed. However, at the same time, some cadres and members developed the illusion that today, with the establishment of the commune, communism had arrived. They prepared to immediately spend 120,000 yuan to build office buildings, commercial buildings, and assembly halls, and to add various new furniture and office supplies. Production teams also requested to buy radios, phonographs, and so on. They considered the existing housing, theaters, bathhouses, factories, etc., to be too "rustic" and wanted everything to be "foreign." The ideas of emphasizing ostentation and competing for extravagance had already begun to emerge among some people. After the commune's Party committee discovered these situations, it believed that failure to reverse this trend would inevitably affect production and be detrimental to the consolidation of the commune. Therefore, it first launched a debate within the Party and then outside the Party.

    The great debate was conducted by carefully calculating accounts and reasoning. They first calculated two major accounts among the cadres: The first account was to calculate the commune's actual financial resources. It seemed that the commune had a lot of income, but the expenses were also quite large. Each time wages were paid, it cost 150,000 yuan, and the administrative expenses of each production brigade totaled more than 1,000 yuan per month. After this calculation, everyone believed that although the commune had a lot of money, the expenses were also large. Although there would be more income next year, it had not yet been received, so it was necessary to pay attention to saving from the beginning of running the commune. Therefore, everyone calculated the second account, which was how to implement the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily and use the money where it was most needed when funds were not yet abundant. Everyone believed that it was necessary to reduce all administrative expenses and that welfare undertakings for commune members should also spend as little money as possible while appropriately improving the lives of commune members and ensuring they eat well and dress warmly. It was not possible to cover all the expenses of commune members' lives at once. While saving expenses, it was even more important to strive for the simultaneous development of agriculture and sideline occupations. In addition to ensuring the needs of agricultural production, a portion of the funds should be invested in the operation of diversified economies in order to continuously expand income. In terms of expanding production, after careful calculation, everyone understood that if the 120,000 yuan used to build the building were used to buy pigs and sheep to raise, it could generate an income of 1.84 million yuan next year. This debate unified the thinking of the cadres, who recognized that they must continue to work hard, further expand production, and save expenses in order to prepare conditions for the future transition to communism.

    Through the great debate, the style of diligence and thrift has been established throughout the commune. All offices, newly built factories, and livestock farms have been built simply and economically, without adding new furniture and office supplies. The 120,000 yuan originally intended for building the building has been used to purchase pigs and sheep, build 23 sweet potato processing plants, and develop diversified production such as forestry and fishery.

### 先盖大楼还是先搞生产？  纪伦寨公社辩论后得到答案

    先盖大楼还是先搞生产？
    纪伦寨公社辩论后得到答案
    本报讯  安徽涡阳县纪伦寨公社开展辩论，驳倒讲排场、比阔气的错误思想，贯彻了勤俭办社方针。
    纪伦寨人民公社是个拥有二万二千多户、九万多人的大社。今年9月下旬办起公社后，不论是干部或是社员，都欢欣鼓舞。但同时在一些干部和社员当中也产生了一种错觉，以为今天办起了公社，就是到了共产主义了，准备马上花十二万元盖办公大楼、商业大楼和大礼堂，添置各种新家具和办公用具。各个生产队也要求买收音机、留声机等等。他们对原有的住房、戏院、澡堂、工厂等等，都认为太“土”了，样样都想搞“洋”的。讲排场、比阔气的思想已经在一些人当中抬头了。公社党委发现这些情况以后，认为不扭转这种风气，势必影响生产，不利于公社的巩固。于是就先党内、后党外开展了大辩论。
    大辩论是以算细账、讲道理的办法进行的。他们先在干部中算了两笔大账：第一笔账是算算公社的家底究竟有多大。看起来社大收入不少，但是开支也是不小的，每发一次工资就得十五万元，各个生产大队的行政开支每月合计也要一千多元。这么一算，大家认为社大钱多，但开支也大，虽然明年还有更多的收入，但是并没有拿到手，必须在办社开始就注意节省。于是大家又算第二笔账，就是在资金还不是宽裕的情况下，如何贯彻勤俭办社的方针，把钱用到最需要的地方。大家认为必须紧缩一切行政开支，对社员的生活福利事业，也应该在适当提高社员的生活，保证吃好、穿暖的前提下尽量少花钱，不能一下就把社员生活上的一切花费都包下来。在节省开支的同时，更要争取农业和副业双翅齐飞的办法，除保证农业生产的需要以外，把部分资金投到多种经济的经营上去，以便不断扩大收入。在扩大生产方面，经过算细账，大家明白了，如果把盖大楼的十二万元购买猪、羊来养，明年就可收入一百八十四万元。经过这场辩论，使干部思想统一起来，认清了必须继续苦战，进一步扩大生产，节省开支，为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件。
    全社经过大辩论，勤俭之风已树立起来。所有办公室、新建工厂和畜牧场，都是因陋就简，没有添置新家具和办公用具，原来打算盖楼房用的十二万元，已用来购买了猪羊，建起了二十三个山芋综合加工厂，并发展了林、渔等多种生产。
