    On the Road to Factoryization
    The Steel Office of the Jinnan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Recently, we conducted a special study on the issue of factoryizing the management of earthen furnace groups with the heads of four iron smelting plants: Chencun in Hongdong, Shaping in Xiangning, Shicun in Linfen, and Houma.
    Of these four iron smelting plants, Houma Iron Plant is operated by a commune, while the other three are county-run. The earliest-built Linfen Shicun Iron Plant has been in operation for over six months, while the other three plants have only been operating for just over one hundred days. All four plants have selected sites, fixed furnace types, and have complete power equipment. In terms of furnace types, except for Shaping Iron Plant, which has two earthen square furnaces experimenting with smelting iron ingots, the rest use earthen blast furnaces for production.
    In terms of personnel, each plant has fixed a batch. The four plants have a total of more than 3,600 employees, with management cadres accounting for an average of 4%. Shicun Iron Plant has the largest proportion of management cadres, accounting for 6%, while Shaping Iron Plant has only slightly more than 1%. Regarding workers, there are three types in these four plants: One is fixed workers. These are the basic long-term workers within the plant, mostly technical workers and ordinary operating workers in power, smelting, coal mining, and mining. The second type is temporary workers and contract workers. These workers have not yet become formal workers within the plant, and can be fixed in batches after a period of training. The third type is the mining and crushing workers of Houma and Chencun Iron Plants. They are both commune members and take turns working at the iron plant in batches. These workers are neither fixed workers nor contract workers.
    The organizational system has been initially finalized. The situations are generally the same, but each has different characteristics. There are roughly three forms. One is a purely factory-style establishment, with a plant headquarters, workshops, and groups. The second is an organizational establishment that combines factoryization and militarization. This form has both factory-style plant headquarters, workshops, and groups, and military organizational forms of regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. The third form is that the leadership organization within the plant is factory-style, while the various production tasks are militarized organizations. The characteristic of this form is that production tasks are not divided into workshops, but companies, platoons, and squads are organized according to task, with the plant director directly leading the company commanders. Although the organizations of these plants have the above three different characteristics, all plant headquarters have various sections, and production units organize professional teams according to different tasks. The tasks can be roughly divided into nine types: smelting, power, mining, crushing, coal mining, coking, infrastructure, transportation, and miscellaneous work.
    In terms of factoryized management, the following methods have been adopted:
    First, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, leading cadres are assigned responsibilities. The Party organizations of these four plants have been established. Although the branches do not have regular meeting systems, major issues are studied at the Party branch committee meetings, decisions are made, and they are implemented separately. Major issues at the Chencun Iron Plant, such as monthly, quarterly, and annual plans, major capital construction projects, the central tasks of each period, and the formulation of important systems, are all studied collectively at the branch committee meetings, and leading cadres are assigned responsibilities. Shicun Iron Plant also stipulates that important tasks such as production, capital construction, and supply in each period are proposed by the functional departments, decided by the Party committee, and implemented by the plant director for administrative aspects and by the Party branch for mass movements. This ensures the unified leadership of the Party and gives play to the role of various departments, basically overcoming the phenomena of individual decision-making and mutual irresponsibility.
    Second, a democratic management form has been initially established, and the broad masses of workers and staff have basically participated in production management and technical management. Shaping Iron Plant has established five committees: the Production Management Committee, the Living Management Committee, the Technical Research Group, the Public Security Committee, and the Mediation Committee. Workers participate in each management committee. The above-mentioned democratic management organizations, except for the Mediation Committee, have begun to play a role. For example, after accounting in early October, Shaping Iron Plant needed to complete the task of 485 tons of pig iron and 45 tons of steel, with a shortage of more than 700 people from mining to smelting. What to do? After research, the Production Committee believed that the main problem was the unreasonable labor organization, not the lack of labor. The meeting decided to mainly improve labor organization, implement the "five fixings" of fixed task, fixed person, fixed quantity, fixed time, and fixed job, and organized six professional companies according to the tasks of mining, smelting, crushing, transportation, coal mining, and infrastructure, and stipulated labor quotas according to the tasks. The Party branch mobilized the workers and staff, and as a result, the problem of labor shortage was solved in October. Without asking the higher authorities for labor, the task was basically completed.
    Third, the factory "constitution" of "two participations, one reform, three combinations, and four greats" has been initially implemented. A common feature of these four plants is that cadres participate in labor. Big blooming, big contending, and big debate have begun to become regular. The broad masses of workers and staff directly participate in the production and technical management work of their respective positions. In terms of cadres participating in labor, Shaping Iron Plant and Houma Iron Plant implement management cadres participating in production for two hours each in the morning and evening, and office work at noon; leading cadres are responsible for the furnace, participating in production and guiding production; and cadres implement a night shift system. In terms of workers participating in management, there are the following methods: (1) Workers elect representatives to participate in the work of various committees. (2) A workers' congress is held once a month, where the plant director reports to the workers on the work of the previous month and arranges the tasks for the next month, which are implemented after discussion by the workers. (3) The production tasks for each period are directly arranged to the furnace and group, and workers generally know the production targets and labor quotas of their own group, furnace, and month. (4) Use the methods of big blooming, big contending, big character posters, and big debate to mobilize the masses to manage the factory themselves and manage themselves. For example, the power team of Xiangning Shaping Iron Plant had very abnormal production. The youth supervision post posted a big character poster next to the furnace criticizing: "The life of the smelting power team is too chaotic, they don't work hard, they get up late, this lazy style should be changed quickly." After the workers of the power team saw it, they immediately convened a meeting of all workers, conducted on-site research, and in addition to posting a big character poster to make a self-criticism to everyone, they also set a living system, and everyone wrote a guarantee. The phenomenon of loose living and not getting up on time was quickly changed.
    Fourth, some simple and easy-to-implement management systems have been established, and the chaotic phenomena in production management, labor organization, financial system, and material distribution have been basically overcome. To sum up, these four plants have established the following basic systems: (1) In production management, production plans are issued quarterly, monthly, and ten-day basis, tasks are assigned to the furnace and group, and plan management is strengthened. Each iron smelting furnace is equipped with one head and one deputy furnace leader, each responsible for the production management of the furnace. Labor is implemented in two shifts, with the head and deputy furnace leaders each leading a shift. Labor competitions are carried out between furnaces and groups, and a monthly evaluation and quarterly award system is implemented. (2) In labor management, a quota management system, technical operating procedures, and original record system have been implemented. The four plants have clearly stipulated labor quotas, technical operating procedures for earthen blast furnace iron smelting, and simple technical and economic indicators. (3) In financial and material management, procedures for financial expenditure review and approval, as well as cash management, material storage, warehousing, distribution and other systems have been stipulated. In addition, each plant has also stipulated leave systems, meeting systems, etc. The stipulation of these systems has overcome the chaotic phenomenon and made all work orderly.
    From the above situation, these four emerging iron smelting plants have achieved considerable success in factoryized management and have gained some experience. However, there are still some problems that need to be studied and improved. These problems are: the organization of individual plants is too large; the core leadership of the Party committee in some plants is not prominent; the commandist style of some cadres is still very serious; workers participate in management, but are still limited to the production and technical work of their own group and furnace, and rarely ask about the economic activities and management work of the entire plant; cost accounting is generally a weak link.
    We believe that in the process of improving "small earthen groups," it is necessary to implement factoryized management, but the management system of modern enterprises should not be mechanically copied without analysis. Accordingly, we put forward the following improvement suggestions for reference, targeting several problems: In the leadership system, it is necessary to implement a division of labor and responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. The Party committee should improve the meeting system. The setting of institutions should strive to be short, small, and efficient, the division of labor should not be too detailed, and there should not be too many tasks, so as to avoid the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing and to facilitate the training of versatile workers. The establishment of various systems is to organize orderly normal production and mobilize workers' enthusiasm and creativity. Pay attention not to constrain the play of human subjective initiative. Various systems must be decided after discussion by the masses, and then implemented among the masses. Each iron smelting plant must attach importance to cost accounting, so as to grasp economic activity analysis, discover problems, and guide production.

    在工厂化的道路上
    中共晋南地委钢铁办公室
    最近，我们同洪洞陈村、乡宁砂坪、临汾史村、侯马等四个炼铁厂的负责人专门对土炉群管理工厂化问题作了研究。
    这四个炼铁厂，除侯马铁厂是公社经营外，其余三个厂都是县营。建厂最早的临汾史村铁厂，至今已有六个多月，其余三个铁厂仅有一百多天。这四个厂都选定厂址，固定了炉型，动力设备齐全。在炉型方面，除砂坪铁厂有两座土方炉试验炼坨铁外，其余都用土高炉进行生产。
    在人员方面，各厂都固定了一批。四个厂共有职工三千六百多人，管理干部平均占4％。史村铁厂管理干部占6％，比例最大，砂坪铁厂，管理干部仅占1％强。在工人方面，这四个厂有三种情况：一种是固定工。这是厂内的基本长期工，多数系动力、冶炼、采煤、采矿等方面的技术工人和普通的操作工人。第二种是临时工和合同工，这些工人还没有成为厂内的正式工人，通过一段培养，便可分批固定。第三种是侯马和陈村铁厂的采矿、碎矿工人，他们既是公社社员，又分批轮流到铁厂劳动。这种工人既不是固定工人，又不同于合同工人。
    机构体制已初步定型。情况大体相同，但各有不同特点。大体分三种形式。一种是纯属工厂化的建制。设有厂部、车间、小组。第二种是工厂化和军事化相结合的机构建制。这种形式既有工厂形式的厂部、车间、小组，又有军事组织形式的团、营、连、排、班。第三种是厂内领导机构是工厂形式，而各生产工种又是军事化组织。这种形式的特点是生产工种不分车间，而按工种组织连、排、班，厂长直接领导连长。这些厂的机构虽有上述三种不同特点，但都是厂部设有各种股，生产单位依不同工种组织专业队伍。其工种大体可分冶炼、动力、采矿、碎矿、采煤、炼焦、基建、运输、杂工等九种。
    在管理工厂化方面，归纳起来采取了如下方法：
    第一、在党支部统一领导下，领导干部分工负责。这四个厂党的组织已经建立。支部虽没有定期会议制度，但重大问题都在党的支部委员会上研究，作出决议，分头贯彻。陈村铁厂的重大问题，如月、季、年度计划，较大的基本建设工程，每个时期的中心任务，重要制度的制定等，都在支委会上集中研究，领导干部分工负责。史村铁厂还规定每个时期的生产、基建、供应等重要工作，由各职能部门提出方案，党委研究决定，属于行政方面的由厂长负责贯彻，属于群众运动方面的由党支部负责贯彻。这样作既能体现党的统一领导，又能发挥各部门的作用，基本上克服了个人决定问题和互不负责的现象。
    第二、初步建立了民主管理形式，广大职工群众基本上参加了生产管理和技术管理。砂坪铁厂建立了五个委员会，即：生产管理委员会，生活管理委员会，技术研究组，治安保卫委员会，调处委员会。每个管理委员会都有工人参加。上述民主管理组织，除调处委员会外，都已开始发挥作用。如砂坪铁厂在10月初经过算账以后，要完成生铁四百八十五吨、钢四十五吨的任务，从采矿到冶炼尚差七百多人。怎么办？生产委员会研究以后，认为主要是劳动组织不合理，而不是劳力缺乏。会议决定主要从改善劳动组织着手，实行定工种、定人、定量、定时、定任务的五定工作，按工种组织了采矿、冶炼、碎料、运输、采煤、基建等六个专业连，并按工种规定了劳动定额。党支部在职工中作了动员，结果10月份解决了劳力不足问题，没有向上级要劳动力，就基本上完成了任务。
    第三、“两参、一改、三结合、四大”的工厂“宪法”得到了初步贯彻。这四个厂的共同特点是干部都参加劳动。大鸣、大放、大辩论开始作到经常化。广大职工直接参加所在岗位的生产、技术管理工作。在干部参加劳动方面，砂坪铁厂、侯马铁厂实行管理干部早、晚各参加生产二小时，中午办公；领导干部包炉参加生产并指导生产；干部实行夜间带班制。在工人参加管理方面有以下方法：（1）由工人选出代表参加各个委员会的工作。（2）每月召开一次职工大会，由厂长向工人报告上月工作，布置下月任务，经工人讨论后执行。（3）每个时期的生产任务直接布置到炉、组，一般工人都知道本组、本炉、本月的生产指标和劳动定额。（4）用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法发动群众自己管理工厂，自己管理自己。如乡宁砂坪铁厂动力班生产很不正常，青年监督岗便在炉旁贴出大字报批评道：“冶炼动力班生活太紊乱，干活不起劲，起床数他晚，这种懒作风，应该赶快改变。”动力班工人看了以后，立即召开全体工人会议，就地作了研究，除贴出大字报向大家检查外，还定了生活制度，每人都写了保证书。生活散漫、不按时起床的现象很快便改变了。
    第四、建立了一些简单易行的管理制度，在生产管理、劳动组织、财务制度、材料领发等方面基本上克服了混乱现象。归纳起来，这四个厂建立了以下几种基本制度：（1）在生产管理上，逐季、逐月、逐旬下达生产计划，任务到炉、到组，加强计划管理。每个炼铁炉设有正、副炉长各一人，负责本炉的生产管理。劳动实行两班制，由正副炉长各带一班。炉与炉、组与组开展劳动竞赛，并实行月评季奖制度。（2）在劳动管理上，实行了定额管理制度、技术操作规程和原始记录制度。四个厂都明确地规定了劳动定额、土高炉炼铁的技术操作规程和简单的技术经济指标。（3）在财务和原材料管理上，规定有财务开支审核批准手续，以及现金管理，材料保管、入库、领发等制度。另外，各厂还规定了请假制度、会议制度等。这些制度的规定，克服了混乱现象，使各项工作有条不紊。
    从上述情况看，这四个新兴的炼铁厂在管理工厂化方面，已取得了不小的成绩，摸到了一些经验。但还存在一些问题需要研究改进。这些问题是：个别厂机构庞大；有的厂党委的核心领导还不突出；部分干部命令作风还很严重；工人参加管理，还局限于本组本炉的生产和技术工作，对整个厂的经济活动、管理工作还很少过问；成本核算普遍是个薄弱环节。
    我们认为，“小土群”提高过程中。既要实行管理工厂化，又不能把现代化企业的管理制度不加分析地加以搬用。据此，针对几个问题提出以下改进意见，供作参考：在领导体制上，必须实行在党委领导下的分工负责制。党委应当健全会议制度。机构的设置，应力求短小精干，分工不宜过细，工种不宜过多，以免发生相互扯皮的现象，并有利于培养多面手的工人。建立各项制度，是为了组织有条不紊的正常生产，调动工人生产积极性和创造性，注意不要约束了人的主观能动性的发挥。各种制度必须经过群众讨论后作出决定，再拿到群众中去执行。各个炼铁厂，必须重视成本核算，以便抓住经济活动分析去发现问题指导生产。
