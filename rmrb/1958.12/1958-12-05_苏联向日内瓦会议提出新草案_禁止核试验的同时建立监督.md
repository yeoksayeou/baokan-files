    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th: The Soviet representative read the Soviet government's statement of November 29th at the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests. Attached to the statement was a new draft agreement from the Soviet government on the permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

    In the statement, the Soviet government first pointed out that the tripartite conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in Geneva on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests had been stagnant and unproductive for more than three weeks because the United States and the United Kingdom were attempting to evade reaching an agreement. The "conditions" and "reservations" put forward by the U.S. and British governments did nothing to help quickly stop nuclear tests because these "conditions" and "reservations" were irrelevant to resolving the problem.

    The statement pointed out that the Soviet government's starting point is that, under any circumstances, the decision to ban nuclear weapon tests and the supervision of this decision should take effect simultaneously.

    The new draft agreement submitted by the Soviet Union for discussion at the conference contains six articles. The draft stipulates that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States solemnly guarantee that they will no longer conduct any type of atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests from the date of signing the agreement. The three governments guarantee to urge all other countries in the world to also undertake this obligation.

    The draft agreement stipulates the establishment of a supervisory body to supervise the fulfillment of the obligation not to test nuclear weapons. This agency will have a network of monitoring posts set up based on the recommendations of the Geneva Conference of Experts. The three governments agree to set up an agreed number of monitoring posts on their territory (for the United States and the United Kingdom, this also includes their territories or trust territories). The monitoring system is established according to the basic provisions of the protocol attached to the agreement. The agreement and protocol will take effect simultaneously.

    The draft states that the agreement is of unlimited duration and will take effect immediately after ratification by all participating countries in accordance with their constitutional procedures.

    The Soviet government's statement made a reservation regarding this draft agreement, saying: if the U.S. and British governments believe it is more appropriate to include the basic provisions of supervision in the text of the agreement, the Soviet government will not object to doing so.

    苏联向日内瓦会议提出新草案
    禁止核试验的同时建立监督
    新华社4日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科4日讯：苏联代表在日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议上宣读了苏联政府11月29日的声明。声明中附有苏联政府关于永远停止核武器试验的协定的新草案。
    苏联政府在声明中首先指出，苏、美、英三国在日内瓦举行的不继续试验核武器会议三个多星期来始终停滞不前、毫无进展，是因为美国和英国企图回避达成协议。美、英两国政府提出的“条件”和“保留条件”丝毫无助于迅速停止核试验，因为这些“条件”和“保留条件”对解决问题毫无关系。
    声明指出，苏联政府的出发点是，在任何情况下，关于禁止试验核武器的决定和对这个决定的监督应同时生效。
    苏联提交会议讨论的协定新草案包含六个条款。草案规定，苏联、英国和美国政府庄严保证，自签订协定之日起将不再进行任何类型的原子武器和氢武器的试验。三国政府保证促使世界一切其他国家也承担这种义务。
    协定草案规定建立一个监督机构来监督不试验核武器义务的履行。这个机构将拥有根据日内瓦专家会议的建议而设置的监督岗网。三国政府同意在本国领土上（对美国和英国而言，还包括在它们的领地或托管地上）设置商定数目的监督岗。监督系统根据协定所附议定书的基本条文设立。协定和议定书将同时生效。
    草案指出，协定是无限期的，并且将在所有参加国根据它们的宪法程序批准后立即生效。
    苏联政府的声明就这个协定草案提出保留条件说：如果美英两国政府认为把监督的基本条文也列入协定本文更为合适的话，苏联政府将不反对这样做。
