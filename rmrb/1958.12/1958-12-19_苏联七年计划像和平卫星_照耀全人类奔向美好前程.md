    Soviet Seven-Year Plan, Like a Peaceful Satellite, Illuminates All Humanity's Journey Towards a Bright Future
    People from All Walks of Life in Hebei, Shanghai, and Other Places Hold Discussions
    Expressing the Need to Continue Efforts to Learn from the Soviet Union
    (Our newspaper's comprehensive report) According to Xinhua News Agency reports, people from all walks of life in Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Shanghai and other provinces and cities have recently held symposiums one after another to warmly hail the Soviet Union's great seven-year plan for developing the national economy.
    At the symposium jointly held by the Shanghai Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Shanghai Institute of International Relations on the 16th, Sheng Pihua, Vice President of the Shanghai Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy is a huge step for the Soviet people towards communism. According to this plan, the Soviet people will be able to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country in the world, the United States, in terms of per capita industrial production in less than fifteen years. Such an unprecedented scale and speed is impossible for any capitalist country. After seeing this plan outline, I, like everyone else, felt infinite excitement, was infinitely encouraged, and wholeheartedly wish the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, one victory after another in completing this great economic program.
    Chen Wangdao, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and President of Fudan University, Zhou Gucheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Liu Simu, President of the Shanghai "Xinwen Daily" newspaper, and Liao Shicheng, President of Shanghai Normal College, all contrasted the Soviet Union's high-speed development of the national economy with the current economic crisis and production decline in capitalist countries, explaining the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and further believing in the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."
    Tang Guifen, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Guangyao, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, Zhang Haobo, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, farmer representative Shen Fuquan, Wang Wei, Vice President of the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Journalists Association, and others unanimously emphasized the importance of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in construction. Wang Wei said: The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy is not only large in scale and fast in speed, but also puts the plan on a very solid and secure foundation in a realistic manner. I am fully confident that the Soviet people can not only complete it, but also complete it ahead of schedule and above quota. In the struggle to accelerate socialist construction, we must learn from the Soviet people's practice of combining great revolutionary spirit with a realistic spirit, and on the basis of this year's Great Leap Forward, work even harder and strive for a greater leap forward next year.
    At the symposium jointly held by the Hebei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 10th, Zhang Chengxian, President of the Hebei Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy has great historical and international significance. The realization of this plan will lay a material foundation for the Soviet Union's transition to communism and further enhance the material strength of the socialist camp. This plan shows that the socialist camp will definitely be able to win in the peaceful competition with the imperialist camp.
    Wu Yunshan, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: The Soviet Union's grand plan for developing the national economy is amazing in terms of the scale of construction and the speed of economic development. It is like a bright peaceful satellite, illuminating mankind. It is a program for taking a big step towards communism. In order to accelerate our country's socialist construction, we must earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's experience and apply the Soviet Union's experience to our country's socialist construction.
    Qi Biting, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Liu Qingyang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Zhu Jisheng, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Zhai Kang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and others spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, and the Soviet Union's seven-year plan also shows a grand vision for our country's construction. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, the people of our country must work harder and defeat the imperialist countries in the peaceful economic competition with absolute advantage.
    At the symposium jointly convened by the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the 11th, Sun Weiru, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, said that the Soviet Union's announcement of this world-shaking huge plan eloquently demonstrates the infinite vitality of the socialist system, and shows that the Soviet Union is leaving the capitalist world far behind at a pace of one day equals twenty years. The gradual realization of the seven-year plan will further enhance the Soviet Union's economic and defense capabilities, and the hands and feet of war provocateurs will be tied even tighter.
    Yue Jieheng, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and Vice President of Northwest University, said that the Soviet Union formulated this seven-year plan based on the rich experience of more than 40 years since the founding of the country and on the basis of the great development of economic and technical strength, so this plan will definitely be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule.
    Wang Boquan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Han Wangchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Li Runshun, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Women's Federation, and others unanimously expressed in their speeches and written statements that they must combine the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in construction with the actual situation in our country and apply it to our country's economic construction, and strive to accelerate our country's socialist construction.
    At the symposium convened by the Hubei Province and Wuhan City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on the 7th, Tang Xing, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: This plan not only encourages the people of the world, but also makes the imperialists' tricks of shouting "policy of strength" and "policy of war" no longer scare people. Hua Yuqing, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: The seven-year plan specifically demonstrates the strength and confidence of the Soviet people, demonstrating that the Soviet Union's economic, cultural, and scientific construction is developing at an increasingly high speed, and that the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and that the paper tiger of imperialism is increasingly seen through by the people of the world.
    Yao Kefang, Chairman of the Wuhan Medical Association, said in his speech that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan has great world significance and historical significance, and it definitely tells people: Communism is no longer a distant future matter, and the light of communist society is already shining before our eyes.
    The Sichuan Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Chengdu Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association jointly held a symposium on the 8th. Participants in the symposium included leaders of various democratic parties, scientific and technological workers, professors, engineers, and people from all walks of life such as workers, youth, women, and military representatives, as well as people who had studied and visited the Soviet Union.
    Zhang Xiusu, Vice President of the Sichuan Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, said at the symposium: "The Soviet people's grand seven-year plan for building communism makes us feel extremely excited. Seven years later, it will surely leave imperialism far behind, making the paper tiger even more panic-stricken, and the world's peace forces even stronger. We are riding the wind and waves and speeding up the construction of socialism. The Soviet Union's grand seven-year plan has brought us tremendous encouragement. We must continue to strengthen the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship, continue to learn from the Soviet Union, and leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again."
    Tong Shaosheng, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province and Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: From the great seven-year plan, we can see that the Soviet Union's economic construction will rise incomparably, the use of atomic energy will be further expanded, automation, mechanization, and electrification will be universally realized, and the people's living standards will be further improved. These all prove the unparalleled superiority of socialism, and the declining imperialism is destined to die.
    Wang Yonggui, a member of the Chengdu Branch of the Jiusan Society, said: The great seven-year plan makes us see that the prospect of communist society is not far away, and the impact of the October Revolution on all mankind is growing. As an educator, I will earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in the future and cultivate new people who are proficient in science and technology and have practical labor training for socialist construction.

    民盟陕西省委副主任委员、西北大学副校长岳劼恒说，苏联是根据建国四十多年来的丰富经验，并且在经济和技术力量得到巨大发展的基础上制订这个七年计划的，因此这个计划一定能够如期完成或提前完成。

    四川省副省长、民主建国会四川省工作委员会主任委员童少生说：从伟大的七年计划中看到，苏联的经济建设将无比高涨，原子能的利用将进一步扩大，自动化、机械化、电气化将普遍实现，人民生活水平将进一步提高，这些都证明了社会主义的无比优越性，走向没落的帝国主义是注定要死亡的。
    九三学社成都分社委员王永贵说：伟大的七年计划使我们看到共产主义社会的远景已经不远，十月革命的成果对全人类的影响越来越大，自己作为一个教育工作者，以后要认真学习苏联先进经验，为建设社会主义培养既通晓科学技术又有实际劳动锻炼的新人。
