    If you want to know the heroic spirit, just look at the small native furnaces.
    Collective creation by workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company:
    Chant: What a Chongqing Steel City, the sky is full of red clouds. If you want to know the heroic spirit, just look at the small native furnaces!
    Ran Wenzhong: The small converter has a crooked mouth, don't dislike it for being small, each furnace refines dozens of pounds of steel, 1070 needs it.
    Wang Furong: Chicken coop furnace, a true hero, a small furnace produces a steel dragon. Men, women, old and young all refine together, refining the steel until it's red, and the people are red too. Chicken coop furnace, excellent! Native methods are no worse than foreign methods. Combining native and foreign methods, both work together. Steel flowers bloom all over the mountains and plains.
    Gao Yang: Chicken coop furnace, looks small, but its hidden skills are amazing. Its mouth eats ten thousand catties of material, refining steel ingots taller than mountains!
    Wu Zhengrong: Everyone comes to refine steel, to make steel production increase many times over. Steel flows like a river, steel ingots pile up like mountains.
    Chen Wenhua: Although the weather is cold, our hearts are warm. Heroes fight bravely in front of the converter. Steel sparks fly and the motor turns, the steelmaking warriors' will is firm. A furnace of steel is produced in ten-odd minutes, refining steel and also training people. Diligently practice in front of the chicken coop furnace, refining steel and also training people.
    Ran Wenzhong: Holding iron shovels, we dig hard, digging through rocks and sand. No matter how hard the rocks or how tough the sand, we will plant steel flowers. Steelmaking is not just for me, you, or him, heroes are praised by everyone. Native furnaces also launch satellites, and wear red flowers at celebration meetings.
    Liu Lin: Small blower, named Snail, born on the hilltop of the Steel School. Just to refine steel for the converter, it puffs up its small mouth and blows without stopping. Small blower, nicknamed Snail, hearing the nickname makes people sad. How can a snail make a Great Leap Forward? It's simply a dead opponent! Small blower opened its mouth: Comrades, listen to the reason. Snail is just my shell, the real skill is inside. Don't look at my skinny figure, I will live longer than Nanshan. The small blower blows the steel water, flowing like an endless river.
    Min Baocheng: Native furnaces are everywhere, steel flowers bloom everywhere; Everyone praises native steelmaking methods, producing a lot of steel with good quality too! Bravely chasing the British Empire, fully building China. Large and small, native and foreign, their power is great, "1070" is conquered!
