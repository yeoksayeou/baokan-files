    Launch a Two-Pronged Attack to Increase Salt Production

    The salt-making industry is one of the main industries of light industry. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial production, its role in the national economy is becoming increasingly important. Soda ash and caustic soda, which belong to basic chemical industry products, require salt as raw materials; in addition to people eating salt, indigenous steelmaking and iron smelting also use salt as an auxiliary material; basic construction uses salt for antifreeze in winter, and hard water needs salt for softening; one ton of chemical fertilizer requires 1.3 tons of crude salt, livestock need to eat salt, and aquatic product processing also needs salt. Next year is a crucial year for the three-year hard battle, and both industry and agriculture will have a magnificent leap forward. According to the law of proportionate development of various sectors of the national economy, the salt-making industry must also have a greater development in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, aquatic product processing, and the growth of people's lives.

    To complete next year's crude salt production tasks, we must start from tapping the potential of existing salt fields, increasing the yield per unit area, and actively expanding and building new salt fields. This year, the unit area yield of crude salt in my country has been greatly improved compared with last year, but the potential is still great. Taking sea salt, which accounts for more than 80% of the total output, as an example, the national average is only 78 tons per hectare, while the Shuangdao No. 1 District of the Lushun Salt Field is as high as 200 tons, of which the Sun Huaxi group reached 240 tons. Salt fields with high unit area yields mainly rely on the masses and carry out technological revolution, in addition to natural conditions. The technological revolution in sea salt production mainly focuses on seven key links, namely water, brine, beach, crystallization, labor, power, and management (the "seven-character guideline"). Water means ensuring a sufficient supply of seawater and striving for seawater with high concentration. Brine means doing everything possible to create high-concentration brine and preserving it well. Beach means strengthening the bottom of the crystallization ponds and compacting the bottom of the evaporation ponds to ensure that the pond slabs do not rot during the peak production season. Crystallization means strengthening crystallization management. Labor means innovating tools to gradually achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization of crude salt operations. Power means running our own power generation to solve the problem of water pumping power in salt fields. Management means strengthening operation management. "Brine is the mother of salt," and where there is brine, there is salt. The experience of indigenous vacuum salt production in well salt areas, the water extraction combined with solar crystallization method in mineral salt areas, and the mining of regenerated salt in lake salt areas are also the directions of technological revolution in these areas. It can be said that the main experiences for increasing production of various salts have been created. The current problem is to overcome various conservative ideas and earnestly promote them. As long as we earnestly promote them, it is entirely possible to increase the unit area yield by 20%-30%.

    In the work of building new and expanding salt fields, we must implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Large-scale salt fields are still the backbone of production. Those that have already started construction should strive to complete them as soon as possible and put them into production ahead of schedule; those that have been completed should produce salt as soon as possible. Medium and small-scale salt fields and indigenous production have many advantages and should be grasped tightly. They can be entirely run by local authorities and people's communes. Salt field construction is mainly earthwork, and does not require many equipment. Communes have a large population and strong strength, and can uniformly allocate labor, so they can completely handle it. Under the leadership of the county party committee, the Tangxia and Xinsheng people's communes in Rui'an County, Zhejiang Province, mobilized the masses and used slack farming seasons for two rounds of concentrated efforts to build seawalls as long as 35 *li* and salt fields with an area of ​​more than 4,000 *mu*, with an annual output of more than 70,000 tons. At present, the distribution of my country's salt-making industry is not entirely reasonable. Among the 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, only 16 provinces, municipalities, and regions produce salt, of which only 11 provinces, municipalities, and regions produce more. Some areas that do not produce salt have already discovered resources, and some have not yet discovered resources, and need to be actively prospected. Wherever there are resources, mobilize the people's communes to run salt fields, produce and use them locally, and sell them locally, which is not only conducive to the communes meeting needs in a timely manner, accumulating funds, and expanding industrial production, but also helps to alleviate the contradiction between production and sales and the tense situation of transportation.

    The task of crude salt production in 1959 is very heavy, but as long as the party committees at all levels strengthen the leadership of the production and construction of the salt industry, implement the party's general line of socialist construction, and walk on two legs, the task of crude salt production can be completed. Walking on two legs speeds up the Great Leap Forward in salt industry capital construction this year.

    (By our reporter) It is estimated that the investment in capital construction of the salt-making industry this year can be completed at 125% of the total actual investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. The annual output of newly built and expanded salt fields is estimated to be about five million tons. After these salt fields are put into production, they will greatly promote the leaping development of my country's salt-making industry. In the construction of the salt-making industry, the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, has been basically implemented, and appropriate attention has been paid to the combination of coastal and inland areas, thus forming two fronts: one is the "small indigenous groups" front led by counties, townships, and communes to restore and build new medium and small-scale salt fields; the other is the "large foreign groups" front led by the central government, provinces, and special districts to build new and expand large salt fields.

    Last winter, a high tide of restoring and building small salt fields was set off in various places. In the construction of salt fields, the Tangxia and Xinsheng People's Communes in Rui'an County, Zhejiang Province, put forward the policy of "two wants and three don'ts," that is, wanting the leadership of the party, wanting to rely on the masses, not asking the state for investment, not asking the state for materials and equipment, and not asking the state for technical forces. In March of this year, more than 400,000 people were mobilized to enclose seawalls 35 *li* long and open up more than 6,000 *mu* of salt flats. In the construction of salt flats, they relied on self-reliance to solve the difficulties of funds, materials, and equipment. Many salt fields also carried out island linking projects, turning "the vast sea into salt fields." Nan'sandao Island in Leidong County, Guangdong Province, marched towards the ocean, building dikes for more than 40 *li*, connecting ten surrounding small islands separately, and building 8,836 *mu* of salt flats.

    Under the impetus of the general line, the construction work of various large salt fields also put forward the slogan of "completing two years of tasks in one year," accelerating the construction speed. The Tangda Salt Field in Hebei Province, with an annual output of 770,000 tons of salt, was originally scheduled to be completed in 1959, and it is estimated that earthwork can be basically completed by the end of this year. Many construction units, based on the characteristics of salt field construction that requires a large amount of earthwork, can use both foreign and indigenous equipment, and does not require high design data, implemented the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" and the construction principle of "designing, constructing, and producing at the same time" during construction, simplifying the design and accelerating the construction. In May of this year, the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province began constructing a salt field in Huanghua County. Due to the implementation of these methods, a salt field with a scale of 420,000 tons per year was built under the condition of lacking technical forces. Many salt fields also adopted the method of decentralizing design, designing on site, and workers participating in the design, so that the design was more practical and met production requirements. Many advanced experiences have also emerged in large-scale earthwork construction. The slope measuring device created by workers at the Tangda Salt Field in Hebei Province increased efficiency by 50 times.

    "The secretary takes command, the whole party mobilizes, divides responsibilities, and carries them out to the end" is an important guarantee for completing the construction of salt fields. Under the direct leadership of the prefectural and county party committees, the Sheyang County Salt Field in Jiangsu Province began construction in March of this year, and now it has mobilized more than 60,000 people to invest in salt field construction.

    两路进军增产原盐
    制盐工业是轻工业的主要行业之一，随着工业生产的大跃进，它在国民经济中的作用愈来愈大。属于基本化学工业产品的纯碱和烧碱要用盐来作原料；除了人要吃盐以外，土法炼钢、土法炼铁也用盐来作辅助材料；基本建设冬季施工要用盐防冻，硬质水要用盐软化；一吨化学肥料需要一点三吨原盐，牲畜要吃盐，水产加工也要盐。明年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，工业、农业都将有宏伟的跃进。按照国民经济各部门按比例发展的法则，制盐工业也必须有较大的发展，才能满足工业、农业、畜牧业、水产加工业的大跃进和人民生活增长的需要。
    要完成明年的原盐生产任务，要从挖掘现有盐场潜力，提高单位面积产量和积极扩建、新建盐场两方面入手。今年我国原盐的单位面积已经比去年大大提高，但潜力仍然很大。拿占总产量80％以上的海盐来说，全国平均每公顷不过七十八吨，而旅顺盐场双岛一区却高达二百吨，其中孙华喜小组达到二百四十吨。单位面积产量高的盐场，除自然条件外，主要是依靠群众，开展技术革命。海盐生产的技术革命，主要抓七个环节。即水、卤、滩、结、工、动、管（七字纲）。水就是要保证有足够的海水供应，并尽力争取浓度高的海水。卤就是千方百计制造高浓度卤水，并且保存好。滩就是加固结晶池底，压固蒸发池底，保证旺季生产时池板不烂。结就是加强结晶管理。工就是革新工具，使原盐操作逐步达到半机械化和机械化。动就是自己办电，解决盐场扬水动力问题。管就是加强操作管理。“卤是盐的娘”，有卤就有盐。井盐区的土法真空制盐，矿盐区的水采结合天日结晶法，湖盐区开采再生盐等经验，也是这些盐区技术革命的方向。可以说，各种盐的增产的主要经验都已创造出来了，现在的问题是要克服各种保守思想，认真推广。只要认真推广，单位面积产量提高20％—30％是完全可能的。
    在新建、扩建盐场工作中，一定要贯彻大中小、土洋并举的方针。大型盐场仍是生产的骨干，已经上了马的，应争取早日峻工，提前投入生产；已经峻工了的，要早日产盐。中小型盐场，和土法生产好处很多，更应抓紧，它可完全依靠地方和人民公社去办。盐场建设主要是土方工程，需要的设备不多，公社人多力量大，能够统一调配劳动力，完全能够办得起来。浙江瑞安县塘下、莘胜等人民公社在县委的领导下，发动群众，利用农闲两次突击，便建成了长达三十五华里长的海堤和四千多亩面积的盐田，年产七万多吨。目前我国制盐工业分布不尽合理。在二十八个省、市、自治区中，只有十六个省、市、区生产盐，其中生产较多的只有十一个省、市、区。没有生产盐的地区，有的已经发现了资源，有的还没有发现资源，需要积极勘察。凡是有资源的，发动人民公社办盐场，自产自用，地产地销，既有利于公社及时满足需要，积累资金，扩大工业生产；也有利于缓和产销的矛盾和运输紧张的局面。
    1959年的原盐生产的任务很重，但只要各级党委加强对盐业的生产和建设的领导，贯彻党的社会主义建设的总路线，用两条腿走路，原盐生产任务是能完成的。两条腿走路速度快今年盐业基本建设大跃进
    本报讯  今年制盐工业的基本建设，预计投资额可完成相当于第一个五年计划期间实际投资总和的125％，新建、扩建盐场的年产量估计约在五百万吨左右。这些盐场全部投入生产之后，将大大促进我国制盐工业飞跃的发展。在制盐工业建设上，基本上贯彻了大中小结合、土洋结合的方针，并适当注意了沿海与内地的结合，因而形成了两条战线：一条是以县、乡、社为主恢复和新建中小型盐场的“小土群”战线；一条是以中央、省、专区新建、扩建大盐场的“大洋群”战线。
    去年冬季，各地掀起了恢复和新建小盐场的高潮。浙江省瑞安县塘下莘塍人民公社在建设盐场中，提出了“两要三不要”的方针。即要党的领导，要依靠群众，不向国家要投资，不向国家要材料和设备，不向国家要技术力量。今年3月，先后出动四十多万人次，围筑成三十五华里长的海塘，开辟盐滩六千余亩。在建设盐滩中，靠自力更生解决了资金、材料、设备的困难。许多盐场还进行了联岛工程，变“沧海为盐田”。广东省雷东县南三岛向海洋进军，筑堤四十多里，分别将周围的十个小岛联接起来，建了八千八百三十六亩盐滩。
    各大型盐场的建设工作在总路线的推动下，也提出了“两年任务，一年完成”的口号，加快了建设速度。年产七十七万吨盐的河北省塘大盐场，原定在1959年建成，预计到今年年底基本上也可以完成土方工程。许多建设单位根据盐场建设土方工作量大、设备可洋可土、设计数据要求不高的特点，在建设中贯彻了“土洋结合”的方针和“边设计、边施工、边生产”的建设原则，简化了设计，加速了建设。河北省天津专区今年5月在黄骅县开始建设盐场，由于贯彻了这些办法，在缺乏技术力量的条件下，建成了年产四十二万吨规模的盐场。好多盐场还采取了设计下放办法，现场设计，工人参加设计，因而使设计更加切合实际，符合生产要求。在大型土方施工中还出现了许多先进经验。河北省塘大盐场工人创造的量坡器提高效率五十倍。
    “书记挂帅、全党动手、分工负责、一抓到底”是完成盐场建设的重要保证。江苏省射阳县盐场在地委、县委的直接领导下，今年3月就开始建设，现在正动员了六万余人投入盐场建设。（附图片）
