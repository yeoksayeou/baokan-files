New Direction and New Path of History

——Introducing "Fifty Years of Qinghe Woolen Mill"
Jian Bozan

The book "Fifty Years of Qinghe Woolen Mill" is a collective work written by the editorial board jointly formed by third-year students of the History Department of Peking University and the workers of Qinghe Woolen Mill. This book is the product of the combination of mental and physical labor, the product of the combination of scientific research and production undertakings, the product of the combination of intellectuals and working people, and the product of the Party's education policy and scientific research policy in specific practice. Such a book should be said to be a "satellite" launched by the students of the History Department of Peking University in the Great Leap Forward in science.

Since the Great Leap Forward in science, under the leadership of the Party, the students of the History Department of Peking University have gone from the ancient and narrow campus to the production departments and combat units of factories, mines, rural areas, shopping malls, and troops. They saw the vast new world, participated in various kinds of labor, broke superstitions, liberated their minds in labor training, and wrote many new historical works on this basis. They wrote "The History of the Anyuan Road and Mine Workers' Movement," "Tiancun is Moving Forward," "The History of Tianqiao Market," "The History of the Fierce Tiger Company," "The History of the Student Movement of Peking University," and many papers criticizing bourgeois historiography. All these works are "satellites" that the students of the History Department of Peking University are preparing to launch. I warmly hope that these satellites can be launched quickly, following "Fifty Years of Qinghe Woolen Mill."

The books written by the students of the History Department of Peking University are all serving production, serving the working people, and serving the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They all mark a new direction and a new path for history, and have played a pioneering role in this regard. They have opened up an infinitely broad new world for history and shattered the "uselessness of history" spread by bourgeois historians.

Perhaps some people will say, "The direction and path of the book 'Fifty Years of Qinghe Woolen Mill' are correct, but what about the quality?" I have read the manuscript of this book before it was published, and I think its quality is also very good. First of all, this book has grasped the principle of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past. With less than half of the length, it succinctly writes about the forty-one years of this factory during the reactionary rule, and with a large amount of space, it describes in detail the nine years of this factory in revolutionary transformation and in the Great Leap Forward after liberation.

Secondly, this book also shows such a characteristic, that is, it does not write about the fifty years of this factory through the factory's ruling institutions, nor through dead material equipment, but through the workers, the workers in struggle, and through the different struggles of these workers against different class enemies in different periods. In this book, what we see is not just one factory director after another, but one struggle after another. It writes about the fifty years of this factory, and also writes about the fifty years of the revolutionary struggle of the workers in this factory.

Thirdly, it does not use empty words, dogmas, or sentimental language to describe these continuous struggles, but uses the unforgettable concrete facts experienced by the workers themselves, with named and surnamed characters, and uses the simple, vivid and lively language of the working class itself to write about these struggles. Write about the battles and encounters of the workers in these struggles, as well as their inner activities in these struggles. In this book, we can hear the tragic cries of the workers, and we can also hear their victorious shouts. This is a historical record, and it is also a poem written by woolen mill workers.

Fourthly, although the facts cited in this book are all individual facts, these facts are unforgettable facts for the workers, and therefore they are relatively important, typical, and sufficient to reflect the general situation and the main problems. And these facts are not arranged in isolation, but are strung together in a thread composed of continuous class struggles, which runs through the fifty years of this factory.

Another characteristic of this book is that it never treats the enemies of the working class with an objectivist attitude, but stands opposite these class enemies, using deep hatred and impassioned emotions to trace the inhumane crimes of the bureaucrats, landlords, capitalists, special agents, scabs, Japanese invaders, traitors, and all kinds of vampires and murderers who once ruled this factory. On the contrary, it shows infinite loyalty to the Party and to the socialist cause. It enthusiastically praises every victory and every step forward in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and praises every new person and every new thing in ideological transformation and technological revolution. Especially in the last section, "The Brilliant Tomorrow," it cheers the establishment of the people's commune, warmly expects the arrival of the beautiful world of communist society, and is full of infinite joy and desire for new people, new things, new life, new era, and for the future of mankind.

The above points are my impressions after reading the manuscript of this book. Of course, this book is only the beginning of history moving towards a new direction and a new path, and it is only a new bud, but this bud ruthlessly shatters the "quality degradation theory" spread by bourgeois historians.

It should be pointed out that the emergence of such a new type of historical work is inseparable from the cooperation of the working class. Without the participation of the workers of Qinghe Woolen Mill in writing, no matter how great a scholar is, he would not be able to write such a book. This is not only because the materials used in this book cannot be found in any books, but more importantly, the rich and sincere class emotions that permeate this book cannot be found in the physiological cells of any non-working-class scholar.

Secondly, the production of this book is inseparable from the vigorous mass movement. According to the students' report, in order to write this book, the Party organization of Qinghe Woolen Mill once launched a mass movement to write the history of the factory. In this mass movement, the workers "recalled the history of the revolution, praised the Great Leap Forward." They all thought, said, painted, and wrote. They reminded each other, supplemented each other, checked each other, and in less than ten days, the workers wrote more than seventy relatively complete and accurate memoirs. These memoirs are the basic materials for writing this book.

Thirdly, the writing of this book is inseparable from labor training. If the third-year students of the History Department of Peking University did not go to Qinghe Woolen Mill to participate in labor, even if the workers provided them with rich materials, they would not be able to write this book. According to the students' report, before they participated in labor, they could not understand the materials provided by the workers. Later, they participated in labor training, went to work, got off work, and worked overtime with the workers, joined the ranks of the working people, transformed themselves into working people, and then they could understand the materials provided by the workers and transform these materials into history.

Finally, it should also be said that the writing of this book is inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Facts have proved that in the writing process of this book, from beginning to end, no historical expert participated in the guidance. The comrades of the Party organizations of Qinghe Woolen Mill and the History Department of Peking University guided the writing of this book. These comrades are not all historical experts. Some of them have studied history, and some may not have studied history. In the words of bourgeois historians, the leaders of the writing of this book are all "laymen" or "pretended insiders." However, this book was written under the leadership of these "laymen" and "pretended insiders," and even if bourgeois "insiders" participated, it could not have been written without their leadership.

In short, the writing process of this book, for the workers of Qinghe Woolen Mill, is a process of summarizing their experience in struggle and their experience in labor creation. For the students of the History Department of Peking University, it is a process of ideological transformation; for both workers and students, it is a process of breaking superstitions and liberating their minds. On the other hand, the writing process of this book proves that the research of history can be carried out in mass movements and in labor training, and it can and must be carried out under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, the publication of this book is a powerful criticism of the various fallacies of bourgeois historians, such as the "contradiction between research and movement," the "waste of labor," and the "laymen cannot lead experts."

The writing of the book "Fifty Years of Qinghe Woolen Mill" is successful. But in any case, it is still a new beginning, still a new bud. We must attach importance to this new bud, but we cannot be complacent about it, because from the perspective of the tasks of the new era, from the ideological height of communism, our efforts are still far behind the objective requirements. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, when one day equals twenty years, we must redouble our efforts, speed up our pace, continue to work hard for the development of history, and strive to plant the red flag on the highest peak of history.

    历史学的新方向新道路
    ——介绍“清河制呢厂五十年”
    翦伯赞
    “清河制呢厂五十年”这本书，是北大历史系三年级同学和清河制呢厂的工人同志们联合组成的编委会集体编写的。这本书是脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的产物，是科学研究和生产事业结合的产物，是知识分子和劳动人民结合的产物，是党的教育方针和科学研究方针在具体实践中的产物。像这样一本书，应该说是北大历史系的同学们在科学大跃进中放射出的一个“卫星”。
    科学大跃进以来，北大历史系的同学们在党的领导下，从古老的狭窄的校园分别走向工厂、矿山、农村、商场、部队这些生产部门和战斗单位。他们看见了广阔的新世界，参加了各种各样的劳动，在劳动锻炼中，打破了迷信，解放了思想，并且在这个基础上写出了不少新的历史著作。他们写出了“安源路矿工运史”、“田村在前进”、“天桥商场史”、“猛虎连队史”、“北大学生运动史”和许多批判资产阶级历史学的论文，所有这些著作，都是北大历史系同学们准备放射的“卫星”。我热烈地希望这些卫星都能够跟着“清河制呢厂五十年”很快地放射出去。
    北大历史系同学所写的这些书都是替生产服务、替劳动人民服务、替社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的。它们都标志着历史学的新方向、新道路，并且在这一方面起了首创的作用。它们替历史学开辟了无限广阔的新天地，粉碎了资产阶级史学家散布的“历史学无用论”。
    也许有人说，“清河制呢厂五十年”这本书，方向和道路都对了，质量怎么样呢？我在这本书出版之前，看过这本书的稿子，我以为它的质量也很好。首先是这本书掌握了厚今薄古的方针。它以不到一半的篇幅，扼要地写出了这个工厂在反动统治时期的四十一年，而以大量的篇幅，详细地描写解放以后这个工厂在革命改造中在大跃进中的九年。
    其次，这本书还显出这样一个特点，即它不是通过这个工厂的统治机构，也不是通过死的物质设备来写出这个工厂的五十年，而是通过工人，在斗争中的工人，通过这些工人在不同的时期和不同的阶级敌人进行的不同斗争来写出这个工厂的五十年。在这本书中我们看到的不仅是一个厂长接着一个厂长，而是一个斗争接着一个斗争。它写出了这个工厂的五十年，也写出了这个工厂的工人革命斗争的五十年。
    第三，它不是用空话、用教条、用酸溜溜的文字来描写这些连续不断的斗争，而是用工人亲身经历的难忘的具体事实，用有名有姓的人物，用朴素鲜明而又生动的工人阶级自己的言语写出这些斗争。写出工人们在这些斗争中的战斗和遭遇，以及他们在这些斗争中的内心活动。在这本书中，我们可以听到工人们的悲惨呼号，也可以听到他们胜利的呐喊。这是历史纪录，也是制呢工人写下的诗篇。
    第四，在这本书中所举出的事实虽然都是个别的事实，但这些事实都是工人们难忘的事实，因而也就是比较重要的，带有典型性的，足以反映一般情况和主要问题的事实。而这些事实又不是孤立的排列，而是被贯串在一条由连续不断的阶级斗争所组成的线索之中，这条线索，贯通这个工厂的五十年。
    这本书还有一个特点，就是它从来不用客观主义的态度来对待工人阶级的敌人，而是站在这些阶级敌人的对面，以刻骨的深仇和激昂的情感来追述那些曾经统治这个工厂的官僚、地主、资本家、特务、工贼、日寇、汉奸，以及各种各样的吸血鬼、杀人犯的灭绝人性的罪行。在相反的方面，对党对社会主义事业则表现出无限的忠诚。它热情地歌颂社会主义革命与社会主义建设中的每一个胜利和每一步前进，歌颂思想改造与技术革命中的每一个新人和每一件新事。特别是在光辉灿烂的明天这最后一节中，它欢呼人民公社的成立，热烈地期望共产主义社会这个美好世界的到来，洋溢着对新人、新事、新生活、新时代和对人类的明天的无限喜悦和渴望。
    以上几点，是我看了这本书的稿子以后的印象。当然这本书还只是历史学走向新方向新道路的开始，还只是一个新的萌芽，但就是这个萌芽，它就无情地粉碎了资产阶级史学家所说的“质量降低论”。
    应该指出，像这样一个新型的历史著作的产生，是和工人阶级的合作分不开的。如果没有清河制呢厂的工人同志们参加写作，天大的学者也是写不出这样一本书来的。这不仅是因为这本书里面所用的资料不是任何书本中所能找到的，更重要地是浸透在这本书中的丰富而又真挚的阶级情感，不是任何非工人阶级的学者的生理细胞中所能发现的。
    其次，这本书的产生和大搞群众运动也是分不开的。根据同学们的报告，为了写这本书，清河制呢厂的党组织曾经发动了一个写厂史的群众运动，在这个群众运动中，工人同志们“人人回忆革命史，个个歌颂大跃进”。他们大家想、大家说、大家画、大家写。他们相互提醒、相互补充、相互核对，不到十天，工人同志们就写出了七十多篇比较完整、确实的回忆录。这些回忆录就是编写这本书的基本资料。
    第三，这本书的写作和劳动锻炼也是分不开的。如果北大历史系三年级的同学不到清河制呢厂去参加劳动，即使工人同志们替他们提供了丰富的资料，也是写不出这本书来的。根据同学们的报告，当他们还没有参加劳动之前，他们对于工人同志们所提供的资料是不能体会的，后来他们参加了劳动锻炼，和工人同志们一起上班、下班，加班，加入劳动人民的队伍，把自己变成劳动人民，然后才能体会工人同志们提出的资料，才能把这些资料变成历史。
    最后，还要说到的，是这本书的写作和党的领导是分不开的。事实证明，在这本书的写作过程中，自始至终，没有一个史学专家参加指导，指导这本书的写作的是清河制呢厂和北大历史系的党组织的同志。这些同志不都是史学专家，他们之中，有些是学过历史的，有些可能没有学过历史，用资产阶级史学家的话说，领导这本书的写作的，都是“外行”或者是“冒充的内行”。然而这本书就是在这些“外行”和“冒充的内行”的领导之下写出来的，而且如果没有他们的领导即使有资产阶级的“内行”参加也是写不出来的。
    总而言之，这本书的写作过程，对于清河制呢厂的工人同志们说，是总结他们的斗争经验和劳动创造经验的过程。对于北大历史系的同学说，是一个思想改造的过程；对于工人和学生两方面来说，都是打破迷信，解放思想的过程。在另一方面，这本书的写作过程，又证实历史学的研究是可以在群众运动中在劳动锻炼中进行的，是可以而且必须在党的领导之下进行。因此这本书的出版，对于资产阶级史学家的各种各样的谬论，如像“研究与运动矛盾论”、“劳动浪费论”、“外行不能领导内行论”等等都是有力的批判。
    “清河制呢厂五十年”这本书的写作是成功的。但无论如何，它还是一个新的开始，还是一个新的萌芽。我们要重视这种新的萌芽，但不能以此自满，因为从新时代的任务来说，从共产主义的思想高度来说，我们的努力还是远远落后于客观的要求。在一天等于二十年的大跃进时代，我们还要鼓足干劲，快马加鞭，为了历史学的发展继续努力，争取把红旗插在历史学的最高峰。
