A Year of Tempering Through Downward Transfer, Limitless Ideological Harvest

(Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot) More than 24,500 cadres of various ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Daur, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after nearly a year of production labor and grassroots work experience, have made great achievements in ideological transformation, increasing knowledge of the struggle for production, and changing the face of rural areas.

Over the past year, these cadres, through labor practice and living, eating, and working with workers and peasants, have not only learned a set of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production techniques and initially cultivated the ideological feelings of the working people, but also received praise from the masses for their ability to endure hardship, actively carry out social work, and closely connect with the masses. To date, according to statistics from only five leagues including Jerim, Zhaowuda, and two cities, Hohhot and Baotou, 4,144 people have been rated as models, and some of them have honorably joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League.

In the past, these cadres, especially some young intellectual cadres from exploiting class families and who grew up in cities, were out of sync with workers and peasants in terms of emotion and life. After a year of production labor, their ideological feelings have changed. Practice has made them realize that a grain of rice and a piece of firewood do not come easily. Many cadres now say, "I only thoroughly understand the saying 'Who knows that every grain on the plate is hard-earned' today. Today, I feel heartache when I see someone stepping on a seedling or wasting a grain of food." In the past, many people covered their noses and hid when they saw manure, but now they compete to scoop manure and carry burdens to pick up manure, fearing that they will not be able to pick it up. In the past, they had headaches about the weather of "muddy streets after a rain," but now they hope for rain in drought and sunny days in floods. This year, after floods occurred in Baotou and other places, the cadres who were sent to these areas bravely rescued crops and the property of the masses.

What is especially important is that people's class stance has been greatly tempered. As Chen Baohua, a cadre who was sent down, said: "My family is a landlord, and my father was struggled against by the masses. From the land reform to before being sent down, I never understood why the peasants hated the landlords so much; it was not until this time when I actually participated in labor that I understood this reason. It turns out that the crops grown by the peasants with their blood and sweat were taken away by the landlords without compensation. How could they not hate them?" Many people felt that they used to shout "Labor is glorious" and "Labor creates the world," etc., but when they actually did it, they were afraid of getting dirty, tired, and being "ridiculed" by others. They regarded the working people as lowly. Cadres who were once criticized as "young masters" and "pale-faced scholars," after being tempered by labor, have begun to abandon the bourgeois lifestyle and gradually established a hard-working and simple lifestyle. Many cadres who were sent down said: "Rural factories are treasure troves of knowledge and political universities, labor universities." They said that labor tempering has eight major benefits: knowing bitterness and sweetness, understanding diligence and thrift, changing thinking, transforming feelings, changing style, growing ambition, increasing knowledge, and strengthening the body.

During the vigorous development of industry, steel production, and the technical revolution, cadres who were sent down also made many contributions. They helped the communes where they were located establish many agricultural experiment stations, livestock improvement farms, poultry farms, breeding stations, veterinary stations, kindergartens, and health centers, and surveyed water sources, designed and built water conservancy projects, etc. Many cadres also boldly created and reformed many agricultural and pastoral production tools. According to incomplete statistics from seven leagues and cities including Zhaowuda, Jerim, and Hohhot, cadres who were sent down created, reformed, and promoted more than 4,200 pieces of agricultural tools such as weeding machines, threshing machines, and waterwheels, some of which increased production efficiency by five to more than ten times. Especially in the movement of the whole people running industry, cadres who were sent down actively offered ideas and methods for the communes and self-organized and assisted the communes in establishing many factories. According to incomplete statistics from five leagues and cities including Ulanqab and Hohhot, 2,100 factories such as bearing, iron and wood, machine repair, cement, paper making, and cotton making were established. At the same time, many industrial products such as air battery lamps, urea batteries, Taigu oil, and artificial hemp were successfully tested.

In the rural cultural revolution movement, more than 80% of the cadres who were sent down actively and proactively established people's schools, spare-time schools, libraries, and clubs for farmers and herdsmen. According to incomplete statistics from seven leagues and cities including Ulanqab and Baotou, cadres who were sent down helped communes establish a total of 2,990 literacy classes, people-run primary schools, spare-time middle schools, agricultural universities, and red and expert universities, with more than 110,000 students participating in the study. Due to their efforts, many cultural townships and cultural communes have emerged in the rural and pastoral areas of the autonomous region this year. Some farmers said: "Cadres who are sent down are cadres who create benefits for the people of all ethnic groups." Some compiled and sang folk rhymes: "Socialism is really good, our culture has been liberated, comrades who are sent down come to help, rural areas establish clubs, reading newspapers and books is really good."

(Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan) The 30,000 cadres in Shanxi Province who have been sent down to forest areas, mining areas, and rural areas for labor tempering have gained a lot in terms of labor and ideological tempering over the past year.

Most of these cadres who were sent down were intellectuals who had lived in cities for a long time. In the past year, in the process of eating, living, and working with farmers, their ideological outlook has undergone profound changes. In labor, cadres who were sent down have developed a hard-working and simple lifestyle. They are reluctant to throw away broken socks and wear them after mending them; they feel at ease only after picking up a bean at their feet. Their thoughts and feelings have also undergone great changes. Guo Daxing, a cadre who was sent down from Datong City, used to cover his nose when he saw a manure truck. When he participated in a manure delivery, he wore a mask, washed it several times when he came back, and still felt disgusted. Now he said, "I don't feel smelly when I deal with manure all day long. Instead, I feel disgusted by those who cover their noses."

While undergoing labor tempering, cadres who were sent down also universally participated in grassroots work, serving as "advisers" to grassroots cadres in rural areas, and learned the working method of the mass line of consulting with the masses on matters, while promoting local work. According to statistics from the suburbs of Datong City, among the 829 cadres who were sent down from Datong City, 465 were serving in the grassroots work of seven townships, including Shuibo Temple in the suburbs. Shuangjinggou Village in Ya'er Cliff Township in the suburbs was originally a well-known backward village. After three cadres who were sent down from Datong City went there, they worked hard and played a leading and exemplary role, helped commune cadres come up with ideas, and improved the awareness of commune members through comparisons, commendations, and debates, and mobilized students from people's schools to organize youth commando teams to promote the development of work, making this village quickly become an advanced village.

Cadres who were sent down also actively participated in the rural technical revolution and cultural revolution. In terms of the technical revolution: they helped the people's communes produce artificial fibers, various fertilizers, and reform agricultural tools. Cadres who were sent down from the Ancient City Commune in the suburbs of Datong have currently produced 15 kinds of tools, such as simple universal combine harvesters and wheat threshers. In addition, cadres who were sent down also helped rural areas establish weather stations, biogas power stations, and various factories. Cadres who were tempered by labor in the Taiyue, Zhongtiao, and Guandi mountain forest areas have currently established more than 120 small factories such as timber processing plants, smoking plants, starch factories, and wineries. In terms of the cultural revolution: they helped townships and communes eliminate illiteracy and established agricultural middle schools, red and expert universities, women's red and expert schools, peasant Marxism-Leninism colleges, sports and art schools, theater troupes, health stations, and hospitals. According to statistics from Jishan County, cadres who were sent down established 49 various schools. Cadres who were sent down in Xingxian County also assisted the local establishment of industrial universities, agricultural universities, and libraries. In the cultural and technical revolution, many people learned professional knowledge and became all-rounders. Zhang Lianzhen, a cadre who was sent down from the provincial directly affiliated organs, was originally a pharmacist. When she went to the countryside, she was unwilling to treat the masses, fearing that she would be responsible if something went wrong. Later, while eating, living, and working with the farmers, she deeply realized the suffering of the masses and was determined to overcome the difficulties of technology and equipment to treat the farmers. Now she has mastered medical techniques in gynecology, pediatrics, surgery, and internal medicine, reaching the level of a doctor.

    知甘苦  懂勤俭  改思想  变感情  转作风  长志气  增知识  强身体
    下放锻炼一年  思想丰收无边
    本报呼和浩特电  内蒙古自治区二万四千五百多名蒙古、汉、回、达斡尔等各民族干部，经过将近一年的生产劳动和基层工作锻炼，在思想改造、增加生产斗争知识及改变农村面貌等方面，取得了很大的成绩。
    这批干部一年来，通过劳动实践及与工人农民同吃、同住、同劳动，不仅学会了一套工农牧业生产技术，初步培养起了劳动人民的思想感情，同时由于他们能够忍苦耐劳，努力开展社会工作，密切联系群众，受到了群众的好评。到目前为止，仅据哲里木、昭乌达等五个盟和呼和浩特、包头两市的统计，已有四千一百四十四人被评为模范，其中有些人并光荣地加入了中国共产党和中国共产主义青年团。
    过去，这批干部特别是其中一些出身于剥削阶级家庭及在城市里长大的青年知识分子干部，在情感上、生活上与工人农民格格不入。经过一年的生产劳动，他们的思想感情已经发生了变化，实践使他们认识到一粒米、一根柴来之不易，现在许多干部都说：“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”这句话，今天我才彻底明白了，“今天看见有谁踩倒一棵禾苗或糟蹋一粒粮食，就感觉心痛”。过去许多人见了大粪就掩着鼻子躲，现在争着掏粪，担着担子拣粪，而且唯恐拾不到。过去头痛“一雨满街泥”的天气，现在则天旱盼雨，天涝盼晴。今年包头等地发生水灾后，下放到这些地区的干部都奋不顾身地抢救庄稼和群众的财产。
    尤其重要的是人们的阶级立场受到了很大的锻炼。如下放干部陈宝华说：“我的家庭是地主，父亲受到群众的斗争，从土改到下放以前，我始终不了解农民对地主为什么那样仇恨；直到这次实际参加劳动，才懂得了这个道理，原来是农民用血汗种出的庄稼被地主无代价地夺了去，能不仇恨吗？”很多人感到自己过去都会喊“劳动光荣”、“劳动创造世界”等，但具体作的时候，却怕脏、怕累、怕别人“耻笑”。把劳动人民看成是低贱的。曾经被人批评为“大少爷”、“白面书生”等的干部，经过劳动的陶冶，已经开始厌弃资产阶级的生活方式，逐步树立起了艰苦朴素的生活作风。许多下放干部都说：“农村工厂是知识的宝库，是政治大学，劳动大学”。他们说劳动锻炼有八大好处：知甘苦、懂勤俭、改思想、变感情、转作风、长志气、增知识、强身体。
    在大办工业、钢铁生产和技术革命运动中，下放干部也做出了不少的贡献。他们帮助所在乡社建立了许多农业试验站、牲畜改良场、家禽场、配种站、兽医站、幼儿园、保健所，并且勘查水源，设计、修建水利工程等。许多干部还大胆创造和改革了许多农牧业生产工具。据昭乌达、哲里木、呼和浩特等七个盟市不完全统计，下放干部创造、改革与推广的锄草机、打谷机、水车等农具就有四千二百多件，其中有些农具提高生产效率五倍到十几倍。特别是在全民办工业的运动中，下放干部积极为乡社出主意想办法，并自办与协助乡社兴办了许多工厂，据乌兰察布、呼和浩特等五个盟市不完全统计，就兴办了二千一百个轴承、铁木、机修、水泥、造纸、造棉等工厂。同时试验成功了空气电池灯、尿素电池、太古油、人造麻等许多工业品。
    在农村文化革命运动中，80％以上的下放干部，积极主动地为农牧民创办民校，业余学校和图书馆、俱乐部等。据乌兰察布、包头等七个盟市不完全统计，下放干部帮助乡社建立的扫盲班、民办小学、业余中学、农业大学和红专大学等共有二千九百九十所，参加学习的学员有十一万多人。由于他们的努力，今年在自治区农村牧区出现了许多文化乡、文化社。有的农民说：“下放干部是给各族人民造福的干部。”有的编唱顺口溜：“社会主义真正好，咱们文化翻身了，下放同志来帮助，农村成立俱乐部，看报读书实在好”。
    本报太原讯  山西省三万名下放在林区、矿区和农村进行劳动锻炼的干部，一年来在劳动、思想锻炼等方面，都得到了很大的收获。
    这批下放干部大部分是久居城市的知识分子。一年来在与农民同吃、同住、同劳动的过程中，他们的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化。在劳动中，下放干部养成了艰苦朴素的生活作风，破了的袜子不舍得丢，打上补钉再穿；看到脚边一粒豆也要捡起来才安心。思想感情也有了很大的改变。大同市下放干部郭大兴过去见了粪车就捂鼻子，在参加一次送粪时，戴了口罩，回来用水洗了好几次，还觉恶心，现在他说：“整天和粪打交道，也不觉得臭了，反到感到捂鼻子的人讨厌。”
    下放干部在劳动锻炼的同时，都普遍参加了基层工作，当了农村基层干部的“参谋”，学会了遇事与群众商量的群众路线的工作方法，同时促进了当地工作。据大同市郊区统计，在八百二十九名大同市下放干部中，仅担任郊区水泊寺等七个乡的基层工作的就有四百六十五名。郊区鸦儿崖乡双井沟村原是个有名的落后村，大同市三名下放干部去了之后，积极苦干，起带头示范作用，帮助社干部出主意，通过评比、表扬和辩论，提高了社员的觉悟，并发动民校学生组织青年突击队，推动工作的开展，使这个村很快变成了先进村。
    下放干部还积极投身于农村的技术革命和文化革命。技术革命方面：他们帮助人民公社制出了人造纤维，各种化肥，改革了农具。大同郊区古城社的下放干部目前已制成了简易的万能联合收割机、打麦机等十五种工具。此外，下放干部还帮助农村建立了气象站、沼气发电站和各种工厂。在太岳、中条、关帝等山林区劳动锻炼的干部目前已办起了木材加工厂、熏烟厂、淀粉厂、造酒厂等一百二十多个小型工厂。文化革命方面：他们帮助乡社扫除文盲，建立了农业中学、红专大学、妇女红专学校、农民马列学院、体育艺术学校、剧团、保健站、医院等。据稷山县统计，下放干部办的各种学校达到四十九所。在兴县的下放干部还协助当地建立了工业大学、农业大学和图书室。在文化技术革命中，很多人学到了专业知识，成了多面手。省直属机关下放干部张连珍原是个司药，下农村时，不愿给群众看病，怕出了问题负责，后来与农民同吃同住同劳动中，深切体会到群众的疾苦，决心克服技术和设备的困难，为农民治病。现在他已掌握了妇科、小儿科、外科、内科等医疗技术，达到了医生水平。  （程理嘉）（附图片）
