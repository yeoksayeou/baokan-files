Fiberboard needs great development,
Durable and beautiful, without shortcomings,
Waste materials and scraps become treasures,
Production and construction can't use it all up.
Thousands of铡(zhá) knives and ten thousand grinding wheels,
Iron pots boil the shredded wood chips,
Using indigenous methods to produce fiberboard,
Greatly breaking conservative mystery.

    碎料变良材
    纤维板要大发展，
    耐用美观没缺点，
    废材碎料变良材，
    生产建设用不完。
    千把铡刀万盘碾，
    铁锅煮烂碎木片，
    土法生产纤维板，
    大破保守神秘感。
