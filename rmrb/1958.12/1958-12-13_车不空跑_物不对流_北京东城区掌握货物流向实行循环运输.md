Vehicles Don't Run Empty, Goods Don't Flow Backwards
    Beijing Dongcheng District Grasps Goods Flow and Implements Circular Transportation

    (Our Newspaper News) The transportation department of Dongcheng District, Beijing, has created a "five-fixed" circular transportation method in its freight work, overcoming unreasonable phenomena in one-way transportation. While ensuring the transportation needs of steel production and key construction, it has also completed a number of daily-use industrial products and agricultural and sideline product transportation tasks.

    Before the implementation of circular transportation, the contradiction between transportation volume and transportation capacity in Dongcheng District was very sharp. In the business hall of the Dongcheng District Transportation Command, at least twenty shippers waited daily to request transportation arrangements. In vehicle dispatching, however, unreasonable phenomena such as empty runs and counter-currents often occurred, seriously wasting transportation capacity.

    Starting in late October, the Dongcheng District Transportation Command decided to reverse this chaotic situation. On one hand, it convened shipper meetings to study the flow and direction of goods to be shipped in November; on the other hand, it sent cadres to understand the use of transportation tools. After five days of investigation and research, it was found that most of the goods to be shipped had transportation patterns. Based on the information gathered, they began to implement the five-fixed transportation method of fixed transportation points, fixed tasks, fixed routes, fixed personnel, and fixed transportation tools, initially overcoming the chaotic phenomenon. Then, based on the implementation of "five-fixed" transportation, the method of circular transportation was promoted: In the last ten days of each month, the goods that needed to be shipped were ranked according to their importance and urgency, flow, and direction. Shippers with locations close to each other, opposite directions of flow, and suitable for circular transportation were grouped together to form a circular transportation line. Then, a flow chart of all the freight in the district was drawn, and transportation was organized according to it. In this way, the empty mileage of vehicles was greatly reduced. Now, the average empty mileage of each car traveling one hundred kilometers only accounts for fifteen kilometers, a 70% reduction compared to the past.

    After this district implemented the "five-fixed" circular transportation, the planning of transportation was greatly strengthened. Various transportation tools have changed from completing the transportation task of one shipper at a time to completing the transportation tasks of two or even more units. For example, the Jingshan Coal Plant, the construction site of the Dongjiao Warehouse, and a construction site on Zhushi Street all requested vehicles from the transportation command. One needed to transport coal briquettes to the eastern suburbs, one needed earthwork to fill the foundation, and one needed to transport earthwork out. In the past, the dispatcher would have to send vehicles to three parties for transportation. Now, as long as vehicles are sent to one party, the transportation tasks of three units can be completed. The car first goes to the construction site on Zhushi Street, transports the earthwork that needs to be moved directly to the construction site of the Dongjiao Warehouse, then runs empty for one kilometer to the Dongjiao Coal Plant, and transports the coal briquettes to the Jingshan Coal Plant. After unloading the coal, it runs empty for another one kilometer to the construction site on Zhushi Street to begin the second cycle. When vehicles are used for long-distance transportation to Huairou, Miyun, and other places, they also try to bring industrial products to the countryside or agricultural and sideline products into the city.

    The transportation command of this district also actively organizes vehicles from organs stationed in the district to participate in circular transportation. Once, they heard that the Ministry of Culture was sending a car to Zunhua County to pick up cadres who were being sent down to the countryside, so they asked the ministry to transport forty tons of daily necessities to the Foye'er Supply and Marketing Cooperative near Zunhua County.

    Due to the implementation of circular transportation, the empty mileage has been reduced and the transportation efficiency has been greatly improved. The average daily transportation volume of cars put into circular transportation has increased by 80%, and the daily transportation volume of horse-drawn carts and freight tricycles has doubled. In this way, not only the transportation tasks of key shippers were guaranteed, but also 20% of the vehicles could be freed up to complete other transportation tasks. By the end of November, the Dongcheng District Transportation Command had transported more than 100,000 tons of winter coal urgently needed by residents of the entire district, as well as 6,000 tons of vegetables and more than 9,000 tons of daily necessities.

    1.  Transport copper wire from the Beijing Copper Wire Factory to the Beijing Special Steel Factory, run empty for a short distance, transport materials from the Quan Dongyang Vegetable Production Cooperative to the Anding Refractory Brick Factory, and then go to the Beijing Copper Wire Factory to start the second cycle.
    2.  Transport earthwork from the Zhushi Street construction site to the Dongjiao Warehouse construction site, run empty for one kilometer to the Dongjiao Coal Plant to transport coal briquettes to the Jingshan Coal Plant.
    3.  Transport sand and gravel from the Lishui Bridge Sand and Gravel Plant to the Chongwai Trolley Repair Factory, run empty for a short distance, and transport coal from the Yongwai Coal Building Wholesale Department to the Coking Command.

### 车不空跑  物不对流  北京东城区掌握货物流向实行循环运输

    车不空跑  物不对流
    北京东城区掌握货物流向实行循环运输
    本报讯  北京市东城区运输部门在货运工作中，创造了“五定”循环运输的方法，克服了单程运输中的不合理现象。在保证钢铁生产和重点建设运输需要的同时，完成了不少日用工业品和农副产品的运输任务。
    东城区在实行循环运输以前，运输量和运输能力的矛盾很尖锐。在东城区运输指挥部的营业室里，每天至少有二十多个托运单位等着要求安排运输任务。在车辆调度中，却常常出现空驶、对流等不合理的现象，严重地浪费了运输力量。
    10月下旬开始，东城区运输指挥部决心扭转这种忙乱状况。一面召开货主会议，研究11月份托运物资的流量和流向；一面派出干部了解运输工具使用情况。经过五天的调查研究，发现绝大部分托运货物都有运输规律。根据了解的情况，他们开始实行了定运点、定任务、定线路、定人员、定运输工具的五定运输方法，初步克服了忙乱现象。接着又在实行“五定”运输的基础上，推行了循环运输的方法：每月下旬把需要托运的货物，分别轻重缓急、流量流向进行排队，发现地点临近，方向对流适合循环运输的托运单位，就将它们编在一起，组成一个循环运输线，然后画成全区托运货物的流量流向图，根据它来组织运输。这样，使车辆的空驶里程大大减少。现在，平均每辆汽车行驶一百公里，不装载货物的空驶里程只占十五公里，比过去减少了70％。
    这个区实行“五定”循环运输以后，运输的计划性大大加强了。各种运输工具都由以往每次完成一个托运单位的运输任务，变为完成两个以至更多单位的运输任务。例如，景山煤厂、东郊仓库工地和猪市大街某建筑工地等三个单位，都向运输指挥部要车。一个需要到东郊去运煤块，一个需要土方填基础工程，一个需要运出土方。在过去，调度员要向三方面派车载运。现在，只要向一方面派车，就能完成三个单位的托运任务。汽车先到猪市大街建筑工地，把需要运走的土方直接运到东郊仓库工地，然后空驶一公里到东郊机煤厂，把煤块运到景山煤厂。卸了煤以后，再空驶一公里，到猪市大街建筑工地开始第二次循环。车辆到怀柔、密云等地长途运输时，也都设法把工业品带下乡或把农副产品运进城。
    这个区的运输指挥部，还积极组织驻在本区的机关车辆参加循环运输。有一次，他们听到文化部要派车到遵化县去接下放干部，就要求这个部带运四十吨日用百货到遵化县附近的佛爷来供销社。
    由于实行循环运输，减少了空驶里程，运输效率大大提高。投入循环运输的汽车平均日运量提高了80％，马车、货运三轮车的日运量翻了一番。这样，不但保证了重点托运单位的运输任务，还能抽出20％的车辆来完成其他运输任务。到11月底，东城区运输指挥部已经运完全区居民急需的十万多吨冬季用煤，还运了六千吨蔬菜和九千多吨日用百货。

    2、从猪市大街工地运土方到东郊仓库工地，空驶一公里到东郊机煤厂运煤块到景山煤厂。
    3、从立水桥砂石厂运砂石至崇外电车修理厂，空驶一小段，到永外煤建批发部运煤到炼焦指挥部。
