Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 4th: Premier Kim Il-sung and the entire delegation of distinguished guests from the Korean government today visited three small factories in Shanghai that have made great achievements using dilapidated factory buildings and old machines: the Construction Machine Factory, the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, and the Smei Glass Fiber Factory. Premier Kim Il-sung highly praised the spirit of daring to think and act shown by the workers in these three small factories and the achievements they have made in production. He also encouraged the workers to continue their efforts and create even greater achievements.

This morning, Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean guests, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, Shanghai Vice Mayor Xu Jianguo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, and Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, visited the Shanghai Joint State-Private Construction Machine Factory. The distinguished guests saw the "ants gnawing at bones" production method created by the workers in this small factory. In the narrow workshops, the guests saw groups of indigenous and small machine tools surrounding huge workpieces, engaged in intense work. Premier Kim Il-sung repeatedly praised the workers' enthusiasm and bold creative spirit, saying that using small machines to produce large equipment is a good thing, a revolutionary method, and you are doing glorious work.

In the afternoon, the distinguished guests visited the Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory, located in a narrow lane and employing only one hundred workers. This factory produces seamless steel tubes with quality that has already caught up with that of British products. Next to a piercing machine, Premier Kim Il-sung and others carefully watched how seamless steel tubes, heated to a glowing red, were manufactured one after another.

At the Smei Glass Fiber Factory, which uses indigenous methods to produce glass fiber, Premier Kim Il-sung visited the drawing workshop, the clay crucible manufacturing workshop, and the weaving workshop with great interest, watching as shiny glass fibers were combined into threads and woven into cloth.

Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean government delegation received a warm welcome from the workers everywhere they visited in these three factories. The workers also presented Premier Kim Il-sung with the products they had produced and technical innovation materials. The distinguished guests also presented the workers with valuable gifts brought from home.

This morning, the distinguished guests also visited the former residence of Sun Yat-sen and went up to the seventeenth floor of the Shanghai Mansion to view the panoramic view of Shanghai.

    金日成首相在上海参观小工厂
    称赞用小机器造大设备是革命的办法
    据新华社上海4日电  金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团的全体贵宾，今天在上海参观了三个利用破厂房、旧机器干出一番事业的小工厂——建设机器厂、永鑫无缝钢管厂和斯美玻璃纤维厂。金日成首相很赞许这三个小工厂的工人们敢想敢做的精神和他们在生产中创造出的成就，并且勉励工人们继续努力创造出更大的成绩。
    金日成首相和朝鲜贵宾们今天上午由陈毅副总理和上海市副市长许建国、外交部副部长曾涌泉、中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光陪同，参观了上海公私合营建设机器厂。贵宾们在这个小厂中看到了工人们创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的生产方法。贵宾们在狭小的车间里，到处都看到一群群的土机床、小机床在围着庞大的工作物，紧张地战斗。金日成首相对工人们的干劲和大胆创造的精神一再加以赞扬，他说用小机器生产大设备是好事情，是革命的办法，你们这样做是光荣的。
    下午，贵宾们来到设在一条狭窄的里弄里、只有一百名工人的永鑫无缝钢管厂。这个工厂生产出了质量已经赶上英国的无缝钢管。在一架穿孔机旁边，金日成首相等仔细地注视着烧得通红的无缝钢管怎样一根接一根地制造出来。
    在用土办法生产玻璃纤维的斯美玻璃纤维厂里，金日成首相很有兴趣地参观了拉丝车间、陶土坩埚制造车间和织布车间，看着一根根发亮的玻璃纤维并成线、织成布。
    金日成首相和朝鲜政府代表团在这三个工厂参观的时候，到处受到工人们的热烈欢迎，工人们并且把自己生产的产品和技术革新资料献给金日成首相。贵宾们也把从国内带来的珍贵礼物赠送给工人们。
    今天上午，贵宾们还访问了孙中山故居，并且登上上海大厦十七楼，观看了上海市全景。
