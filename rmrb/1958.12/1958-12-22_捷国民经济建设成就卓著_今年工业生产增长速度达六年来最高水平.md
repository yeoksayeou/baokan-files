Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 20th: Czechoslovakia has achieved remarkable successes in national economic construction this year.

    Czechoslovakia's industrial production growth rate this year is the highest in the past six years. In the first three quarters of this year, industrial production increased by 12% compared with the same period last year. Labor productivity increased by 7.5% this year, 80% higher than the original plan of 4.2%.

    Many departments that frequently lagged behind have caught up this year. For example, basic construction, heavy machinery manufacturing, coal mines, and transportation have all seen improvements and changes unseen in recent years. Heavy machinery manufacturing, which is the foundation of the entire national economy, produced 750 million crowns more than originally planned this year, completing 104% of the plan. Coal miners have shown a real leap forward this year, mining three million tons more coal than the increased plan, changing the previous situation of partial reliance on imports and basically meeting the needs of national economic development.

    In terms of steel production, Czechoslovakia has surpassed France and Sweden in per capita terms, and is increasingly approaching the United Kingdom. Steel production in the first three quarters of this year fulfilled 100% of the plan. Steel production exceeded the plan. In November of this year, steel production increased by approximately 10% compared with the same period last year.

    In the first half of this year, Czechoslovakia's electricity production and supply increased by 10.3% compared with the same period last year, and more than 400,000 kilowatts of generating equipment were put into production in the second half of the year. At the same time, due to its rich nuclear resources, Czechoslovakia is vigorously carrying out the construction of the first atomic power station and is preparing to further develop atomic power stations vigorously.

    This year, the chemical industry department has taken many measures to change the past situation of lagging behind the world level. At present, the output of chemical fibers per capita has exceeded that of France and Italy, and is approaching the level of the United Kingdom and West Germany.

    In agriculture, the collectivization movement has also achieved significant results. By the end of September this year, the socialist component in agriculture had reached 75%. At present, there are more than 12,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, with 835,000 farm households and more than 4.2 million hectares of farmland. This year, agricultural production increased by 3% compared with last year despite unfavorable weather conditions, and the production of sugar beets and hops has achieved rare harvests. This year's procurement of agricultural products was better than in any previous year. This fully embodies the superiority of socialist large-scale production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 20th: Czechoslovakia's coal industry completed this year's production plan fourteen days ahead of schedule, ten days earlier than last year. In this way, Czechoslovakia's miners won first place in the national socialist production competition.

    This is the most outstanding achievement that miners have made in socialist construction since 1945.

    It is estimated that by the end of this year, Czechoslovakian coal miners will overproduce 2.7 million tons of coal more than the original 1958 target.

    捷国民经济建设成就卓著
    今年工业生产增长速度达六年来最高水平
    新华社布拉格20日电  今年捷克斯洛伐克国民经济建设获得了显著的成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克今年工业生产的增长速度是以往六年中最高的。今年头三个季度工业生产比去年同期增长了12％。今年劳动生产率提高了7.5％，比原来计划的4.2％高80％。
    许多经常落后的部门在今年已迎头赶上。如基本建设、重型机器制造、煤矿和交通运输等方面都出现了近年来未曾有过的好转和改进。作为整个国民经济基础的重型机器制造业，今年比原计划增产七亿五千万克朗，完成计划的104％。煤矿工人今年显示了真正的跃进，比提高了的计划还多开采了三百万吨煤，改变了以往部分依赖入口的情况，基本上能够满足国民经济发展的需要。
    在钢铁生产方面，捷克斯洛伐克按人口计算已超过法国和瑞典，而且日益接近英国。今年头三季中钢铁生产百分之百地完成了计划。钢材的生产超过了计划。今年11月钢铁的生产比去年同期增长了约10％。
    捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年电力的生产和供应量比去年同期增加了10.3％，下半年又有四十多万瓩的发电设备投入了生产。同时，由于拥有丰富核资源，捷克斯洛伐克正在大力进行第一座原子发电站的修建工程，并准备进一步大力发展原子发电站。
    今年化学工业部门采取了许多措施来改变过去落后于世界水平的状况。目前，化学纤维的产量按人口平均已超过法国和意大利，而接近英国和西德的水平。
    在农业方面，合作化运动也取得了重大成果。到今年9月底为止，农业中社会主义成份已达到75％。目前全国已有一万二千多个农业生产合作社，它们拥有八十三万五千农户和四百二十多万公顷农地。今年农业生产在不利的气候条件下，仍比去年增产了3％，甜菜和啤酒花的生产都获得了少有的丰收。今年农产品收购工作的成绩比过去任何一年都好。这充分体现了社会主义大生产的优越性。
    新华社布拉格20日电  捷克斯洛伐克的煤炭工业提前十四天完成了今年的生产计划，比去年还早十天。这样，捷克斯洛伐克的矿工们在全国社会主义生产竞赛中获得了第一名。
    这是矿工们自从1945年以来，在社会主义建设中所取得的最优异的成绩。
    预计，在今年年底以前，捷克斯洛伐克的煤矿工人将超过1958年原定指标多生产二百七十万吨煤。
