Talking about Steel from the Perspective of Dialectics
Li Fanfu

The entire population engaging in steel production is an unprecedented initiative. In just three months, great achievements have been made, and some initial experiences have been gained. However, some new problems have also arisen. Because these are new problems, it's natural for people to have different viewpoints. This short article sets out to discuss several issues in steel production from a philosophical perspective, connecting the abstract with the practical, and steel with philosophy. These are just some crude opinions, and I hope everyone will discuss whether they are correct.

I. The Issue of Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods

There is no debate that steel production must adopt the principle of combining large, medium, and small scales, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. However, there are different views and practices regarding how to combine indigenous and foreign methods, how to view small indigenous groups, and especially whether to continue to develop small indigenous groups extensively in the future, and whether earthen blast furnaces should be gradually improved. One view and practice is: to only engage in small indigenous groups at the beginning, and to continue to develop small indigenous groups extensively in the future, believing that foreign (i.e., modern or advanced) construction is slow and cannot be waited for. Another view and practice is: to engage in combining indigenous and foreign methods from the beginning, and to build more small foreign blast furnaces, small converters, and small open-hearth furnaces in the future, and to gradually develop from small foreign groups to medium foreign groups and even large foreign groups. Which of these two views and practices is correct? We believe that the latter is correct. Small and large, indigenous and foreign, are a unity of opposites. They can be combined and transformed. How to combine and how to transform depends on the conditions. Throughout the country, in a province, in a region, or in a furnace, indigenous and foreign methods can be combined and transformed. The key lies in the conditions. Anhui Province's approach to combining indigenous and foreign methods is as follows: wherever conditions are available, that is, wherever electricity, blowers, iron pipes, certain technical conditions can be resolved, and transportation is convenient, a batch of small foreign blast furnaces of eight cubic meters or more have been established from the beginning. Of course, there are certain difficulties in building these furnaces at the beginning, but once they are established, there are many benefits: high output, good quality, stable production, and significant savings in fuel and labor. How to save labor is a major issue at present. According to the calculations of the Chaoxian County Party Committee, producing one ton of iron using small indigenous blast furnaces requires at least 74 laborers, and sometimes as many as 147 laborers, while producing one ton of iron using small foreign blast furnaces only requires about 10 laborers. This one point alone demonstrates the superiority of small foreign blast furnaces. The number of these small foreign blast furnaces has gradually increased and now accounts for the main part of the province's steel production. However, in the vast rural areas, where conditions for establishing small foreign furnaces are not yet available, it is still necessary to start with small indigenous groups. For example, in the Dabie Mountains area, they have iron sand, charcoal, and a tradition of using indigenous methods to produce iron and steel. Therefore, they can solve problems effectively by using reformed two-section small indigenous furnaces. These furnaces have a decent output and good quality. If these areas emphasized foreign methods from the beginning and abandoned indigenous methods, it would be wrong. However, in the overall proportion of steel production in the province, small indigenous groups no longer occupy a major position. In the Dabie Mountains, some semi-indigenous and semi-foreign furnaces have also been gradually established on the existing basis. Because even in those mountainous areas, firewood will gradually become scarce, conditions have changed, and it will be difficult to sustain the large-scale use of two-section small indigenous furnaces. We advocate combining indigenous and foreign methods, but from the perspective of the entire province, foreign methods should be the mainstay, not indigenous methods. We must not underestimate small and indigenous methods, especially in the initial stage; but we must gradually improve them and not remain at the original level. Because we want to build a modern industry and achieve communism, this is our goal. Starting with a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, from small to large, is a matter of construction steps, and it is the right thing to do. But we cannot regard small and indigenous methods as long-term unchanging or not needing improvement. We should not be superstitious about foreign methods either, regarding them as mysterious and unattainable. We can also transform and simplify foreign blast furnaces, such as changing the shape of the furnace, changing the pipes, and using less steel plate. According to the experience of Anhui Province over the past few months, small indigenous groups must be combined with small foreign groups, and small indigenous groups must develop into small foreign groups, and small foreign groups must develop into medium foreign groups and even large foreign groups in the future. This direction of running steel is not arbitrarily imagined subjectively, but is explored in practice and conforms to the objective laws of development. Of course, China is very large, the conditions are different in various places, and the practices are also different, which is understandable. But the experience from Anhui proves that this approach is reasonable and correct, and as time goes on, it will increasingly prove the correctness of this approach.

II. The Issue of the Unity of Quantity and Quality

This year, the country must produce 10.7 million tons of steel and 16.9 million tons of iron, and Anhui Province must produce 150,000 tons of steel and 1.03 million tons of iron. This is a task we must complete. This task requires us to not reduce the quantity by even one ton and to ensure that the quality meets the standards. Everything is a unity of quality and quantity. If we only pay attention to quantity and not quality, or only pay attention to quality and not quantity, we are being one-sided. If there is this kind of one-sidedness in the guiding ideology, we cannot complete the task well. At the beginning of the great drive for steel production, due to a lack of experience, some places only pursued high output in quantity, ignoring the issue of quality; other places emphasized quality, but could not catch up in quantity. Which of these two approaches is correct? Both approaches are incomplete, and neither can complete the task. But there is an exploratory process here, a development process from low to high. After this period of practice, everyone has gained experience, and the understanding of the issue of both quantity and quality has been resolved.

However, how can we ensure that we complete the task in terms of both quantity and quality?

This requires the combination of politics and technology. First of all, we must emphasize putting politics in command, implement correct policies, launch mass movements, fully mobilize the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. As long as the broad masses are mobilized, and they dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, an endless stream of power can be generated. While fully mobilizing the masses, we must study technology and pay attention to science. Because steelmaking is a science. From the time humans discovered iron and mastered the method of steelmaking, and gradually improved and improved it, a long historical process has passed. This time, our nationwide mass steel production has greatly enriched the experience of smelting. We must learn this science well. Learning should implement the combination of theory and practice, the combination of leaders, the masses, and technicians, and the combination of top-down and bottom-up methods. All new creations must be tested before they can be promoted. These learning methods have proven to be effective in practice. We advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, but this kind of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act must be based on Marxism and natural science. Some comrades admire high-yield abundance and attempt to launch exceptionally large "satellites" without studying technology or paying attention to science, wanting to use a method that does not require much effort to refine a large amount of good steel. This is impossible.

III. The Issue of Launching High-Yield "Satellites" and Ensuring Normal Production

In the great drive for steel production, all parts of the country have adopted the method of launching high-yield "satellites." This method can break superstition, liberate the mind, and encourage the confidence of the masses, especially in the early stages of the movement, it has played a certain role. But there are also different opinions on launching "satellites." One view is that the method of concentrating all efforts to launch "satellites" has many benefits and can be boldly pursued. Another view is that launching "satellites" must take into account quality and must be combined with ensuring normal production. We believe that the latter understanding is more comprehensive. The relationship between launching "satellites" and ensuring normal production should also be a dialectical relationship, and ensuring normal production should be the main focus. The purpose of launching "satellites" is not just to inspire people, but to promote production. If launching "satellites" cannot guarantee quantity and quality, and if production cannot be stabilized at a higher level after launching "satellites," then this method may not be beneficial to steel production. Steel "satellites" have different characteristics from agricultural "satellites." In agriculture, high-yield "satellites" such as wheat or rice not only have high yields, but the quality is generally good as well. Steel is different. Iron has first-class iron, second-class iron, and sintered iron, etc. Steel also has high-grade steel, high-quality steel, ordinary steel, and scrap steel, etc. Bad iron cannot be refined into good steel, and scrap steel cannot be used as steel products. Therefore, only talking about the number of tons of steel without saying anything about the quality cannot solve the problem. No matter how high the output of bad iron and scrap steel is, they cannot be counted as "satellites." Should we continue to launch "satellites" in the future, and what kind of "satellites" should we launch? We believe that it is wrong to affirm or deny launching "satellites" across the board. In the future, we should advocate launching "satellites" that are of good quality, high yield, well-repaired furnaces, and that save on raw materials (especially coal) and labor. After launching "satellites," we must not only be able to guarantee normal production, but also make production rise step by step. If it is such a "satellite," it is worth continuing to promote.

IV. The Issue of Decentralization and Concentration

In our great drive for steel production, we have adopted the method of combining widespread blooming with grasping key points, that is, the method of combining decentralization and concentration. This approach was correct in the early stages of mobilizing the entire party and the entire people to engage in steel production. What about in the future? There are different opinions on this issue. One view is that widespread blooming should continue in the future, and decentralization should continue. Every people's commune, every factory, office, and school should refine iron and steel, so that small amounts can accumulate into large amounts. Another view is that after steel production has become widespread, we should pay attention to rational layout and appropriate concentration in the future. We should establish steel bases in places with ore, coal, electricity, and convenient transportation (either based on ore or based on coal, but one or two conditions must be met). Leaders should focus on key points and should not disperse their efforts. We believe that the latter view is basically correct; but we should not absolutely oppose decentralization and concentration, they can be combined and transformed. Here, we must also look at the conditions. We are neither blindly concentrating nor blindly decentralizing. We should concentrate where concentration is needed and decentralize where decentralization is still needed. According to the direction of development, we must not only combine indigenous and foreign methods, and focus on foreign methods, small indigenous groups must develop into small foreign groups, and then develop into medium foreign groups and even large foreign groups. This will inevitably require appropriate concentration, the establishment of bases, and the strengthening of key points; but key points are divided into large key points and small key points. Small key points are concentrated in relation to the original decentralized situation; but many small key points are decentralized in relation to large key points. Therefore, concentration and decentralization, points and surfaces should be well combined. In addition, schools and offices that meet the conditions can establish small-scale steel factories; but this is not a matter of layout. The role of these factories is mainly to combine teaching with labor, to combine steelmaking with personnel training, and to train cadres. At the same time, we should also distinguish between the primary and secondary. In the future, schools should focus on education, hospitals should focus on treating diseases, factories should focus on production, and cadres should have appropriate arrangements for participating in labor. Steelmaking should be regarded as an important sideline.

V. Conclusion

Combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on foreign methods, emphasizing both quality and quantity, and rational layout are the methods we have adopted for running steel. Anhui Province has done this for several months, and experience has proven that this approach is in line with the current objective reality.

To do a good job in steel production, just like doing a good job in other work, subjective guidance must conform to objective laws. Objective laws and subjective understanding are also a unity of opposites. To correctly or approximately reflect the objective subjectively, and to resolve the contradiction between the subjective and the objective, a certain amount of time and repeated research are required. We have been engaged in mass steel production for only two or three months. We can see some issues clearly in general, and some issues still need to be studied further. If we do not continuously observe problems from the perspective of materialist dialectics and deeply analyze reality, our subjectivity cannot correctly reflect objectivity, and we will commit subjectivism.

Dialectics requires us to observe things using the law of the unity of opposites, the law of the transformation of quality and quantity, and the law of negation of negation. These laws are not difficult to understand; but in real life, theory and practice are often easily disconnected, and when encountering practical problems, dialectics is often discounted. For example, as mentioned earlier, in steel production, some comrades see the small but not the big or see the big but not the small, see the indigenous but not the foreign or see the foreign but not the indigenous; value quantity but not quality or value quality but not quantity; value politics but not technology or value technology but not politics; only seek more and faster, regardless of good and economical, or only care about good and economical without seeking more and faster, etc., are all one-sidedness of thinking methods. Some comrades cannot distinguish between the primary and secondary when looking at problems, and cannot see the direction of development, such as the issue of combining indigenous and foreign methods and the issue of understanding small indigenous groups. Why does this happen? In simple terms, it is a lack of respect for dialectics. There are different situations of disrespect for dialectics: either not learning it well; or although learning it, not using it to observe problems and deeply analyze reality. Therefore, it is of great significance to continue to advocate learning philosophy among the vast number of cadres and the masses, especially to advocate respecting materialist dialectics, using dialectics to analyze practical problems, and to constantly summarize experiences.

    从辩证法谈钢铁
    李凡夫
    全民大搞钢铁，这是史无前例的创举。仅仅三个月，已经获得很大成绩，摸到一些初步经验，也产生一些新问题。因为是新问题，人们有不同看法是很自然的。这篇短文为自己提出一个任务，就是把钢铁生产中的几个问题提到哲学上来讨论，把务虚与务实相联系，把钢铁与哲学相联系，这只是一些粗浅的意见，是否对头，希望大家来讨论。
    一、土洋结合问题
    钢铁生产必须采取大中小并举、土洋结合的方针，这一点是没有争论的；但土洋如何结合，对小土群如何看法，特别在今后是否还要大量发展小土群，土高炉是否应当逐渐提高，则有不同看法和做法。一种看法和做法：一开始只搞小土群，今后还要大量发展小土群，认为洋的（即现代化的或高级的）建设慢，不能等待。另一种看法和做法：一开始就搞土洋结合，今后要多建小洋高炉、小转炉、小平炉，并且要由小洋群逐渐发展为中洋群以至大洋群。这两种看法和做法哪一种对呢？我们认为，后一种是正确的。小与大，土与洋是对立面的统一，它们可以结合，也可以转化。如何结合，如何转化，则要看条件。在全国，在全省，在一个地区，在一个炉子中，土洋都可以结合，也可以转化，关键在于条件。安徽省土洋结合的做法是这样的：凡是条件具备的地方，也就是凡是电力、鼓风机、铁管子、一定技术条件能够解决以及交通便利的地方，一开始就建立了一批八立方公尺以上的小洋高炉，这种炉子初建时，当然有一定困难，但建立起来以后，好处很多，产量高，质量好，生产稳定，而且可以大大节约燃料和劳动力。目前如何节约劳动力，是一个大问题，根据巢县县委的计算，用小土高炉生产一吨铁，最少需七十四个劳动力，有时多至一百四十七个劳动力，而用小洋高炉生产一吨铁，只需十个劳动力左右，仅此一端，即可见小洋高炉的优越性。这种小洋高炉已逐渐增多，现在已占全省钢铁生产的主要部分。但在广大农村中，在建立小洋炉的条件还不具备的地方，开始还是要搞小土群。比如在大别山地区，他们有铁砂，有木炭，有土法炼钢铁的传统，因此他们使用经过改革的两截小土炉，很能解决问题。这种炉子产量不低，质量也很好。如果这些地区一开始就强调搞洋的，而放弃土的，就不对头了。但在全省的钢铁生产比重中，小土群已不占主要的地位。在大别山区，在现有基础上，也已逐渐建立一些半土半洋的炉子了。因为即使在那些山区，木柴也将逐渐发生困难，条件起了变化，大量使用两截小土炉也就难于持久了。我们主张土洋结合，但是从全省来说，应以洋为主，而不应以土为主。我们对小的、土的不能轻视，特别是开始阶段是如此；但必须逐步提高，不能始终停留在原有的水平上。因为我们要建设现代化工业，要搞共产主义，这是我们的目的。开始从土洋结合着手，从小到大，这是建设步骤问题，这样做是对的；但不能把小的土的看作可以长远不变或不需要提高的。对洋的我们也不要迷信，看作是神秘的高不可攀的东西。我们对洋高炉也可以改造，可以简化，如炉形的改变，管道的改变和少用钢板等。根据安徽省几个月来的经验，小土群必须结合小洋群，小土群必须发展为小洋群，小洋群今后还要发展到中洋群以至大洋群。这个办钢铁的方向，并不是凭主观任意想像出来的，而是在实践中摸索到的、符合客观发展规律的。当然，我们中国很大，各地的条件不同，做法也不一样，这是可以理解的。但从安徽的经验证明，这样的做法是合理的、正确的，随着时间的发展，愈来愈证明这种做法的正确性。
    二、数量与质量的统一问题
    今年全国要生产一千零七十万吨钢，一千六百九十万吨铁，安徽省要生产十五万吨钢，一百零三万吨铁，这是我们必须要完成的任务。这个任务，既要求我们在数量上一吨不能减少，在质量上又必需合乎规格。任何事物都是质与量的统一物。如果我们只注意数量，不注意质量，或只注意质量，不注意数量，都是片面性。如果在指导思想上有这种片面性，就不能很好完成任务。在开始大搞钢铁时，由于没有经验，有些地方只追求数量上的高产，忽视了质量问题；另一些地方，重视了质量，但在数量上赶不上去。这两种做法哪一种对呢？两种做法都是不全面的，两者都不能完成任务。但这里有一个摸索过程，有一个由低到高的发展过程。经过这一时期的实践，大家已有了经验，对于既要重视数量，又要重视质量这个问题，在认识上已经解决了。
    但是，我们又怎样才能保证在数量上和质量上都完成任务呢？
    这就要靠政治与技术的结合。首先必须强调政治挂帅，要贯彻执行正确的方针，要大搞群众运动，充分发动群众，把群众的积极性充分调动起来，只要把广大群众发动起来，使他们敢想、敢说、敢干，就可以发生无穷无尽的力量；在充分发动群众的同时，必须钻研技术，讲究科学。因为炼钢铁是一门科学。从人类发现铁和掌握炼钢铁的方法，并逐渐把它们提高改进，已经过很长的历史过程。这次我国全民大搞钢铁，又使冶炼的经验大大丰富起来。我们对于这门科学必须很好学习。学习应贯彻理论与实践相联系，领导、群众、技术人员三结合，由上到下和由下到上相结合等方法，一切新的创造都要经过试验才去推广，这些学习方法实践证明是有效的。我们提倡敢想、敢说、敢干，但这种敢想、敢说、敢干，又必须建立在马克思主义和自然科学的基础上。有些同志羡慕高额丰产，企图放出特大“卫星”，而不钻研技术，不讲究科学，想用不大费力的方法炼出大量好的钢铁来，这是不可能办到的。
    三、放高产“卫星”与保证正常生产问题
    在大搞钢铁中，全国各地都采取放高产“卫星”的方法，这种方法，可以破除迷信，解放思想，鼓舞群众的信心，特别在运动初期，是曾经起过一定作用的。但对放“卫星”也有不同的意见。一种意见认为集中一切力量来放“卫星”的方法好处很多，可以放手大干；另一种意见认为放“卫星”必须照顾质量，必须与保证正常生产相结合。我们认为，后一种认识是比较全面的。放“卫星”与保证正常生产的关系，也应该是一种辩证的关系，并应以保证正常生产为主。放“卫星”的目的，不仅仅是为着鼓舞人心，而且是为着促进生产。如果放“卫星”不能使数量与质量得到保证，在放“卫星”后不能使生产稳定在较高的水平上，那么，这种方法对于钢铁生产未必是有利的。钢铁“卫星”与农业“卫星”有着不同的特点。在农业上，如麦子或稻子的高产“卫星”，不但产量高，质量一般也是好的。钢铁就不同了。铁有一类铁、二类铁和烧结铁等。钢也有高级钢、优质钢、普通钢和废钢等。坏铁不能炼好钢，废钢不能作钢材，所以只说钢铁吨数多少，不说质量如何，是不能解决问题的。坏铁和废钢不论产量如何高，都不能算作“卫星”。今后是否还要放“卫星”，放什么样的“卫星”呢？我们认为，对放“卫星”一概肯定或一概否定都是不对的，今后应提倡放质量好、产量高、炉子修得好、原材料（特别是煤）和劳动力又节约的那种“卫星”。在放“卫星”后，不但要能保证正常生产，还要使生产步步上升。如果是这样的“卫星”，是值得继续提倡的。
    四、分散与集中问题
    我们在大搞钢铁中，是采用遍地开花与抓重点相结合的方法，也就是分散与集中相结合的方法。这种做法，在发动全党全民搞钢铁的初期是对的，今后又如何呢？对这个问题，也有不同的意见。一种意见认为，今后仍要遍地开花，继续分散，每个人民公社，每个工厂、机关和学校，都要炼铁炼钢，这样才能积少成多。另一种意见认为，钢铁生产已经普及之后，今后应该注意合理布局，适当集中，要在有矿石有煤炭有电力和交通便利的地方（或者就矿石，或者就煤炭，总要具备一两个条件）建立钢铁基地，领导要抓重点，而不应分散力量。我们认为，后一种意见基本上是正确的；但不要把分散与集中绝对对立起来，它们是可以互相结合，也可以互相转化的。这里也要看条件，我们既不是盲目的集中，也不是盲目的分散，应该集中的地方就集中，应该分散的地方仍要分散。按发展方向来说，我们既要搞土洋结合，并以洋为主，小土群必须发展为小洋群，又发展为中洋群以至大洋群。这样势必要适当集中，建立基地，加强重点；但重点又有大重点与小重点之分，小重点对原来分散的情况来说，是集中的；但许多小重点对大重点来说，又是分散的。因此，集中与分散，点与面应很好结合。另外，凡是条件具备的学校和机关，可以建立小规模的钢铁工厂；但这不是属于布局问题，这些工厂的作用主要在于使教学与劳动相结合，在于炼铁与炼人相结合，在于锻炼干部。同时还应分清主次，今后学校应以教育为主，医院以治病为主，工厂以生产为主，干部参加劳动时间应有适当安排，对于炼铁炼钢则应看作是一项重要的副业。
    五、小结
    土洋结合、以洋为主、质量并重、合理布局，这是我们办钢铁所采取的方法，安徽省几个月来就是这样做的，经验证明，这种做法是符合当前客观实际的。
    我们要搞好钢铁生产，正如要搞好其他工作一样，主观指导必须符合客观规律。客观规律与主观认识，也是对立面的统一，要主观正确地或近似地反映客观，解决主客观的矛盾，须要有一定的时间和反复研究。我们全民大搞钢铁，只有两三个月的时间，有些问题我们已可大体看得清楚，有些问题，还须继续研究。如果我们不用唯物辩证法的观点不断地去观察问题，深入分析实际，我们的主观就不能正确反映客观，我们就会犯主观主义。
    辩证法要求我们用矛盾统一的规律、质量互变的规律、肯定否定的规律去观察事物。这些规律并不是很难理解的；但是在实际生活中，理论与实际往往容易脱节，遇到实际问题，辩证法往往被打了折扣。比如前面说过，在钢铁生产中，有些同志见小不见大或见大不见小，见土不见洋或见洋不见土；重量不重质或重质不重量；重政治不重技术或重技术不重政治；只图多快，不顾好省，或只顾好省不图多快等等，都是思想方法的片面性。有些同志看问题分不清主次，看不清发展方向，如对土洋结合问题和对小土群的认识问题就是如此。为什么会发生这种情况呢？简单一句话，就是不尊重辩证法。不尊重辩证法也有不同的情况：或者没有很好学习它；或者虽然学习了，但没有运用它去观察问题，深入分析实际。因此，目前在广大干部和群众中继续提倡学习哲学，特别要提倡尊重唯物辩证法，用辩证法去分析实际问题，去不断总结经验，有着很重要的意义。
