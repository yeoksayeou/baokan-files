Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: According to a report in "Akahata," the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 19th, reiterating its call to communist parties, workers' parties, and peace-loving and justice-seeking people around the world to extend hands of solidarity and support to the Japanese people's struggle for a victorious verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident."

The appeal pointed out that the final appeal hearing of the "Matsukawa Incident" at the Japanese Supreme Court concluded on November 26th, supported by the unified action of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The hearing confirmed that the seventeen workers accused in the "Matsukawa Incident" are innocent.

The appeal stated that although the majority of the Japanese people are demanding that the defendants be declared innocent, the expected verdict of the Japanese Supreme Court in two or three months is not optimistic. The appeal pointed out that although the Kishi Nobusuke government suffered a serious setback in its conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law," it has not abandoned its intention to be subordinate to U.S. imperialism, drag Japan into the U.S. imperialist war plan, and revive Japanese militarism. The appeal said that a Kishi Nobusuke government like this is in danger of exerting political pressure on the "Matsukawa Incident" trial and again sentencing the innocent defendants to death. The appeal pointed out that this is clearly an act of trampling on the Japanese Constitution and undermining democracy, and at the same time an act of accelerating the path to war.

The appeal expressed heartfelt gratitude for the support and encouragement given to the Japanese people by fraternal parties and democratic organizations in the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd, Tokyo: A national rally demanding the innocent release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" was held in Tokyo on the evening of the 22nd. Approximately 300 representatives from Tokyo and from prefectures such as Osaka, Aichi, and Fukushima participated in the rally, which was jointly held by the "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the Tokyo Regional Council.

The rally adopted future action guidelines. The guidelines stipulate that the movement to secure the innocent release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" should closely coordinate with the spring struggle to be launched by workers next year, encourage six million workers to participate in practical actions, and launch forceful actions at all levels to demand the innocent release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

The guidelines stipulate that February of next year will be held as a month to demand the Japanese Supreme Court to release the defendants innocently, and March 8 will be designated as a day to demand a verdict of innocence for the defendants. On that day, various forms will be used to demand that the Japanese Supreme Court pronounce the defendants innocent and release all defendants.

    日共再次向兄弟党和各国人民呼吁 
    要求支援“松川事件”的斗争
    日本人民明春展开争取释放无辜被告的强大运动
    据新华社讯  东京消息：据“赤旗报”报道，日本共产党中央委员会19日发表呼吁书，再次呼吁各国共产党、工人党和全世界爱好和平与正义的人民，对日本人民为争取“松川事件”裁判胜利的斗争，伸出团结和支援的手。
    呼吁书指出，日本最高裁判所进行的“松川事件”最后一审的口头辩论，在日本广大人民统一行动的支持下，已经在11月26日结束。辩论证实了“松川事件”被告十七名工人是无罪的。
    呼吁书说，虽然大多数日本人民都要求宣布被告无罪，但是预料日本最高裁判所在两三个月后的判决是不容乐观的。呼吁书指出，因为岸信介政府虽然在实现修改“警察官职务执行法”的阴谋上遭到严重失败，但是它并没有放弃从属于美帝国主义，把日本拉入美帝国主义的战争计划和复活日本军国主义的意图。呼吁书说，像这样的岸信介政府，就有对“松川事件”裁判施加政治压力，并且再次判处无辜被告死罪的危险。呼吁书指出，这显然是蹂躏日本宪法和破坏民主的行为，同时也是加紧走向战争道路的行为。
    呼吁书对于各兄弟党和民主团体在“松川事件”斗争中给予日本人民的支援和鼓励表示衷心的感谢。
    新华社23日讯  东京消息：东京在22日晚间举行要求无罪释放“松川事件”被告全国大会。东京本地以及来自大阪、爱知、福岛等县的代表约三百人参加了这个由“松川事件”对策协议会、日本工会总评议会、东京地方评议会联合举行的大会。
    大会通过了今后的运动方针。方针规定，争取无罪释放“松川事件”被告的运动应该密切配合工人明年展开的春季斗争，促使六百万工人参加实际行动，并且在各个岗位展开实力行动，要求无罪释放“松川事件”的被告。
    方针规定，在明年2月举行要求日本最高裁判所无罪释放被告月，并且把3月8日定为要求宣判被告无罪日，在当天以各种形式要求日本最高裁判所宣判被告无罪并释放全体被告。
