    Give Play to Mass Wisdom, Tap into "Big" and "Foreign" Potential
    Anshan Iron and Steel Massively Builds Small Indigenous Steel Rolling Mills
    (Our dispatch) Anshan Iron and Steel (Group) is relying on the masses to build small, indigenous steel rolling mills, opening up a new path for large enterprises to increase production capacity in a faster, better, and more economical way.
  The small, indigenous steel rolling mills currently being manufactured by various rolling mills at Anshan Iron and Steel can increase the production of various steel products by about 250,000 tons annually. These rolling mills are designed and manufactured by the rolling mill workers themselves, using waste materials, without state investment, and during their spare time from production. The structure of these machines is very simple, the equipment materials and parts are all made from waste products, the machine frames are welded from scrap steel plates or steel billets, the heating furnaces are built with waste bricks, the rollers are made from the original discarded rollers of the workshop, and other parts are found in the scrap piles.
    In the past, Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mills had ideas of "emphasizing foreign over indigenous" and "emphasizing big over small." Since the central government put forward the policy of "combining large, medium and small" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods," the workers have opened their minds and started to manufacture small, indigenous steel rolling mills to meet the country's growing need for steel. In August, the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant manufactured two sets of small tube rolling mills to support the Southwest region. Then, in a short period of time, it re-manufactured two more sets and installed them in the old factory buildings. These two seemingly simple machines can roll out 60,000 tons of small seamless steel tubes a year, almost catching up with the factory's original designed capacity. In the past, all large and small specifications of steel tubes in the seamless steel tube plant had to be rolled by large hot rolling mills. Each time a specification was rolled, the machine had to be stopped for five or six hours to change the rollers, and sometimes only three or four tubes were rolled after a roller change before another change was needed. This affected the increase in steel production. Now, seamless steel tubes under 76 mm are all handled by small tube rolling mills, and the original hot rolling mills can concentrate on rolling large steel tubes, effectively utilizing the equipment capacity.

### 发挥群众智慧  挖掘“大”“洋”潜力  鞍钢大造小土轧钢机

    发挥群众智慧  挖掘“大”“洋”潜力
    鞍钢大造小土轧钢机
    本报讯  鞍钢各大洋轧钢厂依靠群众自己动手大搞小、土轧钢机，为大企业多快好省地增长生产能力开辟新的道路。
  目前鞍钢各轧钢厂正在制造的小、土轧钢机，每年可以增产各种钢材二十五万吨左右。这些轧钢机都是轧钢工人在保证生产之余，不用国家投资，自己动手设计、制造出来的。这些机器的构造都很简单，设备材料和机件全部利用废品，机架是用废钢板或钢坯焊接起来的，加热炉是用废砖砌成的，轧辊是用原车间的报废的轧辊改造的，其他，一些零件都是从废品堆里找出来的。
    鞍钢各大型轧钢厂过去存在着“重洋轻土”“重大轻小”思想，自从中央提出“大中小结合”“土洋结合”的方针以后，职工们打开了脑筋，开始制造小、土轧钢机，来满足国家对钢材日益增长的需要。鞍钢无缝钢管厂8月份制造两套小型轧管机支援西南地区，接着，又在很短的时间内重新制造出两套，安装在旧厂房里。这两台看来很简陋的机器，一年可以轧出六万吨小无缝钢管，几乎赶上了这个工厂原来的设计能力。无缝钢管厂过去大、小规格的钢管全部都要经过大型热轧机轧制，每轧一种规格要停机五、六个小时换轧辊，有时换一次辊只轧三、四根又要再换一次。这样就影响了钢材产量提高。现在，七十六公厘以下的无缝钢管全由小轧管机担负起来了，原有的热轧机集中力量轧大型钢管，有效地发挥了设备能力。（附图片）
