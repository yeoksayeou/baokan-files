Xinhua News Agency report: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is actively preparing to implement the basic farmland system. The autonomous region is vast, sparsely populated, and has a small labor force, resulting in a long-standing practice of "extensive planting and meager harvests." Although grain production has increased year by year in recent years, the yield per mu is still not high. In order to completely change this situation, the Ningxia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Committee of the Autonomous Region have proposed to resolutely implement the policy of less planting, high yield, and more harvest. Combining this with the recent movements of manure accumulation and water conservancy construction, they have mobilized the masses to discuss the issue using methods of recollection, comparison, and detailed accounting, based on summarizing past experiences in increasing production.

The discussions in various regions show that the high yields of over 1,000 jin per mu achieved throughout the region this year were obtained on the basis of emancipating the mind and intensive cultivation. The yield per mu of high-yield fields is equivalent to several times to dozens of times that of "extensive planting and meager harvest" fields. According to a survey of the Red Star, Xingguang, and Limin cooperatives in Zhongning County, each person can manage three mu of basic farmland with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu, requiring a total of 99 workdays and yielding 6,000 jin of grain. If the "extensive planting and meager harvest" method is adopted, each person manages twelve mu, using 120 workdays, but only yields 2,160 jin of grain. Other counties also calculated similar detailed accounts in the discussions. After these calculations, the masses believe that planting basic farmland well can not only achieve high yields and more harvests but also save labor.

In the discussions, the masses believe that in order to plant basic farmland well and achieve the goals of "less planting, high yield, and more harvest," it is necessary to resolutely implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."

Currently, 600,000 laborers throughout the region have invested in various construction tasks for basic farmland. Deep plowing has reached 2.6 million mu; over 75.8 billion jin of manure have been accumulated, and over 148.8 million jin of native fertilizer have been produced. Twenty-five large and medium-sized reservoirs in the southern plateau gully area have been started one after another, and soil improvement work in the irrigation area has also been launched on a large scale.

    宁夏积极准备实行基本农田制
    据新华社讯  宁夏回族自治区积极准备实行基本农田制。自治区地广、人稀、劳力少，在耕作上多年来一直是“广种薄收”。近年来粮食产量虽然逐年上升，可是亩产量仍然不高。为了彻底改变这种面貌，中共宁夏工委和自治区人民委员会提出要坚决贯彻少种、高产、多收的方针，并且结合最近的积肥、兴修水利等运动，在总结以往增产经验的基础上，发动群众用回忆、对比、算细账的方法加以讨论。
    各地讨论的情况表明，今年全区亩产千斤以上的高额产量，都是在解放思想、精耕细作的基础上获得的。种高产田的一亩产量相当于“广种薄收”田的十几倍到几十倍。据中宁县红星、星光、利民三个社的调查，亩产二千斤的基本农田，每人可经营三亩，共需工九十九个，可收粮食六千斤；采用“广种薄收”的办法，每人经营十二亩，用工一百二十个，但只收粮食二千一百六十斤。其他各县在讨论中也都算了类似的细账。这样算了以后，群众认为，把基本农田种好，既能高产多收，又能节省劳力。
    群众在讨论中认为，要想种好基本农田，达到“少种、高产、多收”的目的，必须坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”。
    目前，全区已有六十万个劳力投入了基本农田的各项建设工作。深翻地已达二百六十万亩；积肥七百五十八亿多斤，制造土化肥一亿四千八百多万斤。南部高原沟壑区的二十五个大、中型水库已经陆续开工，灌区的土壤改良工作也已大规模地展开。
