    Daring to Think and Act and Seeking Truth from Facts
    Wang Pu
    The widespread surge of the communist spirit of daring to think, act, and create among the people is a hallmark of our era. The practice of millions of people daring to think, act, and create has shattered many "conventions," broadened people's horizons, enabled them to more fully grasp the objective laws of the development of many things, and enriched, developed, and revised some technical principles.
    Consider the workers at the Harbin Machine United Factory. They say, "We're not afraid of big tasks, we're afraid of being afraid." At first glance, it seems that as long as you're bold, you can solve problems, which smacks of relying on your own courage. But on closer analysis, it makes sense. It means that everything can be understood. Workers in large factories can master the laws of manufacturing large machines, and workers in small factories can also master them. What's frightening is being timid and hesitant when encountering difficulties, and not studying them. Based on the principle that all large machine tools are composed of three parts—the cutter (cutting head), the rotor (transmission device), and the body (machine tool bed)—they created "building block" type mobile machine tools to replace several large machine tools. They broke the superstition that small factories cannot manufacture large machinery, but they did not deny the laws of manufacturing large machinery. On the contrary, they more fully understood and better applied these laws. In the process of the development of things, once people grasp its laws, they will change from passive to active, and their subjective initiative will be further brought into play. This kind of daring to think, act, and create while seeking truth from facts can achieve construction alongside destruction, creating something new whilst dismantling the old.
    Of course, in the process of daring to think, act, and create, not everyone can succeed immediately without any setbacks. In the midst of a vigorous mass movement, some people inevitably take detours and run into snags. There are various reasons for taking detours and running into snags, which must be analyzed specifically. Some people highly respect objective laws, are bold and meticulous, and study diligently day and night. However, because it takes a process to understand and grasp the laws of the development of relatively complex things, failure is inevitable even after several experiments. This is not surprising. All scientific experiments cannot succeed with just one or two attempts. "606" and "914" only succeeded after hundreds of experiments. Such detours and snags should be considered normal.
    Another reason for taking detours and running into snags is often due to a lack of a calm head, thinking that breaking superstitions means denying objective laws and that one can do whatever one wants. This is a big mistake. Of course, the courage of these people is still commendable. We should not pour cold water on them, but we need to sprinkle a little alum to clarify their thinking, so that they understand that they must grasp objective laws, respect objective laws, and seek truth from facts, so that people's subjective initiative can turn possibilities into realities and realize their foresight.
    The observers, the accountants, and the naysayers also pay lip service to seeking truth from facts, respecting objective laws, and so on. Their purpose is only to deny the positive suggestions of the masses, belittle the noble style of the masses daring to think, act, and create, or, in other words, they are pouring cold water on the masses everywhere. Revolutionary progressives must draw a clear line between themselves and them, and resolutely fight them to the end.

    敢想敢干和实事求是
    王朴
    人民群众中敢想敢干敢独创的共产主义风格普遍高涨，是我们的时代的特征。千百万群众敢想敢干敢独创的实践，破除了许多
  “常规”，给人们打开了眼界，使人们更全面地掌握许多事物发展的客观规律，丰富、发展和修正了一些技术原理。
    请看吧，哈尔滨机联机械厂的工人们说：“不怕活大，就怕害怕。”乍一听，好像只要胆子大就能解决问题，有点迷信自己胆量的味道。但细加分析，却有道理。它的意思是说：任何事物都是可以被认识的，大工厂的工人能够掌握制造大机械的规律，小工厂的工人也能掌握它；可怕的是遇着困难就束手束脚，不去钻研。他们根据一切大型机床都不外由三个部分——刀子（切削头）、转子（传动装置）和身子（机床床身）组成的原理，创造了“积木式”的活动机床来代替好几种大机床。他们破除了认为小厂不能制造大型机械的迷信，但并不否认制造大型机械的规律，恰恰相反，他们更全面地认识这种规律，更好地运用了这种规律。人们在事物发展的过程中，一旦掌握了它的规律，就会从被动变为主动，使主观能动作用就得到进一步的发挥。这种实事求是的敢想敢干敢独创，就可以做到破而不乱，有破有立。
    当然，在敢想敢干敢独创的过程中，并非人人都能马到成功，一帆风顺。在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，难免有些人走弯路，碰钉子。走弯路，碰钉子有各种原因，要具体分析。有一些人很尊重客观规律，胆大心细，日夜苦心钻研。但因为认识和掌握比较复杂的事物发展的规律需要一个过程，试验几次仍不免失败。这并不奇怪。一切科学试验，都不是一次两次就能试验成功的。“六○六”、“九一四”是试验了几百次才成功的。这种走弯路、碰钉子应当被认为是正常的。
    走弯路、碰钉子的另一原因，往往是由于缺乏冷静的头脑，以为破除迷信就是否认客观规律，爱怎么样就能怎么样。这就大错特错了。当然，这些人的勇气仍然可嘉。对他们不应泼冷水，但需要撒一点明矾，使思想澄清一下，让他们懂得必须掌握客观规律，尊重客观规律，实事求是，人的主观能动作用才能把可能性变成现实性，把预见性实现出来。
    观潮派，算账派，摇头派之流，他们也口口声声地叫什么实事求是，尊重客观规律，等等。其目的只不过是否认群众的积极建议，贬斥群众的敢想敢干敢独创的高尚风格，或者说，他们是处处向群众泼冷水。革命促进派必须同他们划清界限，并且坚决同他们进行斗争到底。
