Oil Workers' Poetry on the Oil Sands Mountain
    Wu Bin Tao Xuehong

    "Declare war on the Kunlun Mountains! Order the Earth to offer up its oil!" This is the oath of the oil workers fighting in the Oil Sands Mountain area of ​​Qaidam. They are drilling countless oil wells of all sizes at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, wanting to let oil flow all over the country and become the blood irrigating the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    Since the technological revolution and the cultural revolution were launched, drilling workers have set off a high tide of poetry. Countless poems created by the workers have written about their love for Qaidam; they have written about their ambition to build the motherland and their heroic spirit. On the wall of the auditorium of the Oil Sands Mountain Exploration Area, a loud battle song is written like this:

    Drill through the Gobi Desert for thousands of feet,
    Traverse the Kunlun Mountains thousands of times.
    We will surely gather the oil waves into a river,
    And turn the treasure upside down to the sky.
    The Kunlun Mountains become an oil sea,
    The Gobi desert turns into fertile fields.

    Accelerating drilling will find large oil fields sooner. Drilling workers are determined to surpass Wang Jinxi of Yumen and Zhang Yunqing of Xinjiang, two advanced drilling teams. The 32108 drilling company posted a letter of challenge, stating that it would
  "Cross the Tianshan Mountains and surpass the Qilian Mountains," strive for the top, and surpass Britain as soon as possible.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the transportation company has had five vehicles that have broken through the "10,000 miles per month" mark. The employees wrote:
      "What does wind, sand and severe cold matter?
    Accelerate the wheels like flying clouds,
    What is difficult about high mountains and steep ridges?
    Enthusiasm soars to the ninth heaven.

    It is not without difficulties to conduct oil exploration in the Gobi Desert. But storms and sand can only scare cowards. A worker named Hongliu wrote:
      "Wind and sand, don't blow, scorching sun, stop being rude.
    Issue a warning order and ask you to change your temper."

    Whether working in exploration teams or chemical plants, female oil workers have shown unparalleled courage and revolutionary spirit. The collective poems created by the female oil workers of the chemical plant expressed their determination:
      "Overwhelm Mu Guiying, enrage the living Wu Song.
    The benchmark is inserted high into the clouds, and the roots are rooted in the top of the Kunlun Mountains.
    The east wind stirs up the courage of heroes, and the enthusiasm frightens the American wolves to death."

    After studying the Party's General Line, the employees of the electromechanical workshop put forward the following fighting slogan:
    Spare no effort, Hengxin competes with the sun and the moon, and strive for the top with perseverance surpassing the Foolish Old Man.
    Find large oil fields with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and let politics take command so that everyone is red and expert.
    Encouraged by this slogan, the rework scrap rate of the workshop's machine repair decreased from 7% in the past to 1%.

    The workers of the earthwork team, the pioneers of drilling, are mostly transferred cadres. Although they have only undergone a few months of physical labor training, they have learned the skills of labor. Thanks to their efforts, roads stretched from the exploration area base to dozens of oil well sites. The second platoon of the fourth company of the earthwork project regiment created an average of 40 cubic meters of earthwork dug per person per day, and the highest one could dig 116 cubic meters of earthwork.

    The oil workers of Oil Sands Mountain, with the spirit of masters of culture, have written many bold and revolutionary poems, and use these poems to encourage themselves and their comrades to fight against nature. Before the Great Leap Forward, a drilling rig could only drill three or four hundred meters a month, but now 50% of the drilling rigs can drill more than one thousand meters a month. Currently, each drilling company has put forward a target of drilling two thousand meters per month. A drilling worker with the pseudonym "Geng Hong" wrote:
    The red drilling team climbs to the peak, and talented people explore for oil.
    Monthly drilling of two thousand years and ten thousand, the enthusiasm and drilling strength break through the sky.

    Oil workers are the "masters of the oil field". Thanks to their heroic labor, oil gushes from the ground like a spring. The refinery is being expanded day and night under intense conditions. The workers wrote:
    The oil well is amazingly divine, spraying hundreds of tons a day.
    If you want to refine oil quickly, expand the refinery as soon as possible.

    The battle of the oil workers of Oil Sands Mountain is advancing at a speed of a thousand miles a day. The fruitful results of labor production are constantly breeding more and better poems. People say that Qinghai is a very lovely place in the motherland, and Qaidam is a treasure house in Qinghai with abundant resources and the most mineral deposits, and Qaidam is praised as a "treasure pot". These poems by the oil workers of Oil Sands Mountain can be said to be a bunch of flowers blooming in the "treasure pot".

    石油工人诗话油砂山
    吴斌  陶学洪
    “向昆仑山宣战。喝令地球献出石油”。这是战斗在柴达木油砂山地区的石油工人的誓言。他们在昆仑山下钻凿无数个大小的油井，要让石油流遍全国，成为灌溉工农业生产大跃进的血液。
    自从技术革命和文化革命开展以来，钻井工人掀起了一个诗歌跃进高潮。无数的工人创作的诗篇，写出了他们对柴达木的热爱；写出了他们建设祖国的雄心壮志和英雄气概。在油砂山探区大礼堂的墙上，宏亮的战歌这样写着：
    钻透戈壁千万丈，
    踏遍昆仑万重山。
    定把油浪汇成河，
    要把宝藏翻上天。
    昆仑山下成油海，
    戈壁沙滩变良田。
    加速钻井，才会早日找到大油田。钻井工人们决心超过玉门王进喜和新疆张云清两个先进井队。32108钻井连队贴出挑战书，表示要
  “越天山，超祁连”，力争上游，早日超过英国。
    大跃进以来，运输连已有五部车突破了“月行万里关”。职工们写道：
      “风砂严寒算什么？
    加速车轮似腾云，
    高山峻岭有何难？
    干劲冲上九重天。
    在戈壁上进行石油勘探不是没有困难的。但是风暴和砂石只能吓倒那些胆小鬼。一个叫洪流的工人写道：
      “风砂不要刮，赤日休无礼。
    下道警告令，叫你改脾气。”
    无论在勘探队或是化工厂工作的女子石油职工，她们都表现了无比的英勇和革命的气魄。化工厂的石油女职工们集体创作的诗歌，表示了她们的决心：
      “压倒穆桂英，气死活武松。
    标杆高插入云端，根扎昆仑山头上，
    东风鼓起英雄胆，干劲吓死美国狼。”
    机电车间职工学习了党的总路线后，提出了这样的战斗口号：
    鼓足干劲恒心比日月，力争上游毅力赛愚公。
    多快好省找出大油田，政治挂帅人人红又专。
    在这个口号鼓舞下，车间的机修返工废品率，由过去7％降低到1％。
    钻井开路先锋——土方队的工人，大部分是下放干部。他们虽然只经过几个月的体力劳动的锻炼，却学会了劳动的本领。在他们的努力下，条条公路由探区基地伸向了数十口油井场。土方工程团四连二排，创造了平均每人日挖四十立方公尺的土方，最高的一人能挖到一百十六立方公尺土方。
    油砂山的石油工人们，以文化主人的气魄，写下了许多豪迈的革命的诗篇，又以这些诗篇鼓舞自己和战友们向大自然斗争。大跃进前一部钻机一月只能打三、四百公尺，现在有50％的钻机，一月能钻进一千公尺以上。目前，每一个钻井连队又提出了月钻双千的指标。一个署名为“更红”的钻井工人写道：
    红色井队攀高峰，风流人物探石油。
    月钻双千年双万，干劲钻劲冲破天。
    石油工人是“油田的主人”，由于他们的英勇劳动，石油像泉水一样由地下喷出。炼油厂正在日夜紧张地进行扩建。工人们写道：
    油井惊天神，日喷数百吨。
    要油炼得快，炼厂早扩建。
    油砂山石油工人的战斗，正在以一日千里的速度向前飞驰。劳动生产的丰硕的战果，不断孕育出更多更好的诗篇。人们都说，青海是祖国一个十分可爱的地方，柴达木又是青海资源丰富、矿藏最多的宝库，把柴达木称颂为“聚宝盆”。油砂山石油工人们的这些诗篇，可以说是开在“聚宝盆”中的一束鲜花。
