Crushing Machinery: Labor-Saving and Efficient

——Introducing Several Easy-to-Manufacture, High-Efficiency Rock Drilling and Crushing Tools and Equipment

The following six rock drilling and soil crushing equipment have been proven in production practice to be easy to manufacture and highly efficient. Without the need for power operation, they can increase efficiency by several times to dozens of times compared to manual drilling or hammer crushing, making them worthy of promotion.

Foot-Operated Hammer Drill

This foot-operated hammer drill was created by Comrade Liu Deshun of a certain unit of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Its structure is shown in Figure 1. This hammer drill can use both feet instead of both hands, allowing human work to take a step towards semi-mechanization.

The hammer drill looks similar to parallel bars. A steel strip is horizontally attached to the front legs, serving as a bracket for the drill bit. A seat board is horizontally installed on the rear legs, where the worker sits during operation. A hammer roller is installed in the middle of the wooden frame, with a pair of pedals hanging below the roller. By stepping on the pedals with both feet, the hammer forcefully strikes the drill bit, performing drilling. This hammer drill's drilling efficiency in rocks with a hardness of 12-15 is twice that of manual operation. Its advantages are reduced labor intensity and guaranteed safety. This hammer drill can drill horizontal, upward-sloping, and downward-sloping blast holes. If a crank handle is installed at one end of the roller, it can also be operated by hand instead of foot.

Hand-Pulled Hammer Drill

This hammer drill consists of parts such as a hammer, slider, pulley, pull rope, and support frame, as shown in Figure 2. The pulley is made of wood with a diameter of 6-7 cm, and the pull rope is best made of leather. The inner width of the support frame is 24 cm, the length is 160 cm, and the height is determined according to requirements.

The structure of this hammer drill is very simple. The hammer is equipped with four small wheels that slide on the slider. One end of the hammer is tied to a pull rope that passes over the pulley, with a handle at the end. The other end is also tied to a pull rope, also with a handle at the end. During work, one hand forcefully pulls the rope passing over the pulley, causing the hammer to strike the drill tail forcefully. Then, the other hand pulls the handle at the other end of the hammer, pulling the hammer back to its original position. This repeated pulling performs drilling.

This hammer drill can drill 50 cm per hour in rocks with a hardness of 15, and 4 meters per day. If two or three hammers are installed on one unit, rapid excavation can be achieved in smaller cross-section tunnels using manual drilling. This simple equipment not only reduces labor intensity but also ensures work safety.

Foot-Operated Drilling Machine

The foot-operated drilling machine is used for drilling downward and is suitable for open-pit mining. This drilling machine uses impact force for rock drilling, and its structure is shown in Figure 3. The drill seat is installed on the drill tail, and a guide rod is installed on the surface of the drill seat. The impact hammer is slidingly fitted with the guide rod, and the impact hammer is tied to one end of a hemp rope. The other end of the hemp rope is tied to the pedal and passes through a guide pulley in the middle (the guide pulley is installed on a triangular frame). During work, two workers simultaneously step down on the pedal, causing the impact hammer to rise to a certain position. Then, the pedal is released, and the impact hammer relies on its own gravity to generate kinetic energy to strike the drill seat for drilling.

The impact hammer weighs 30 kg. Each time the hammer strikes, the drill holder moves the handle of the drill seat to rotate the drill bit slightly (approximately 45° each time).

If a drill bit with a diameter of 40 mm is used, the lifting height of the hammer is 1 meter, and the impact rate is calculated at 8 times per minute, then this drilling machine can drill 4 meters per shift in dense iron ore.

Suspended Bow Flying Hammer Crusher

During the Great Leap Forward for steel production, the Steel Corps of Licun Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, mobilized the masses to create a suspended bow flying hammer crushing equipment to liberate the large amount of labor occupied in crushing.

The structure of the suspended bow flying hammer is very simple (see figure). It consists of four parts: a bow frame, a suspended bow, a flying hammer, and a base plate. A wooden frame (bow frame) is made of round wood with a thickness of 0.1-0.2 meters. A bow-shaped suspended bow is made of elastic wood such as elm wood and steel wire, and is tied to the upper crossbar of the bow frame. A square or spherical flying hammer is carved from hard rock and tied to the middle of the bowstring of the suspended bow. A base plate is placed under the flying hammer, and a suspended bow flying hammer crusher is made.

The suspended bow flying hammer crusher is divided into four types: large, medium, small, and steelyard type.

The large-scale equipment has a hammer weight of 600 kg (stone hammer), a bow frame height of 8.5 meters, and a bowstring length of 11 meters; the medium-sized equipment has a hammer weight of 250 jin (stone hammer), a bow frame height of 6 meters, and a bowstring length of 8 meters; the small-sized equipment has a hammer weight of 80 jin (iron hammer), a frame height of 3 meters, and a bowstring length of 5 meters; the steelyard-shaped equipment has a hammer weight of 80 jin (iron hammer), a frame height of 5 meters, and a bow bar length of 7 meters.

These four types of equipment do not have significant differences in structure, but there are some differences in the size of the crushed ore and the processing volume, which should be selected based on specific circumstances.

Large flying hammers crush large ores weighing about 100 jin, and a group of 8 people operates in two shifts. This large flying hammer can crush 1.45 tons of ore per hour, and about 15 tons of ore per day (calculated at 10 hours). In the past, manually crushing such large ore could only crush 110 jin per day, which means that a large flying hammer operated by 8 people is equivalent to more than two hundred workers crushing ore, and the work efficiency is increased by dozens of times.

Medium-sized flying hammers are suitable for crushing ores weighing about 30 jin. A group of 4 people can crush 5 tons of ore per day, and the work efficiency is increased by 20 times compared to manual crushing.

Small flying hammers and steelyard-shaped flying hammers are suitable for crushing small pieces of ore and are operated by two people. They can crush 1500 jin of ore per day, increasing work efficiency by 6 times compared to manual crushing.

Based on the experience of Licun Township in using suspended bow flying hammer crushers, five major advantages are summarized. 1. Save labor and improve work efficiency. 2. Simple to manufacture and low cost. A large flying hammer costs only 47 yuan; a medium-sized one costs 41.5 yuan; a small and steelyard-shaped one costs 32.4 yuan. 3. Simple to operate and easy to master. 4. Production safety. 5. Can crush large pieces of ore.

Hand-Operated and Electric Dual-Purpose Jaw Crusher

Hefei University of Technology has successfully manufactured a hand-operated and electric dual-purpose jaw crusher. This is a combination of local and foreign technology, and production practice has proven that the crushing effect is good.

I. Purpose and Performance

This crusher is designed based on the commonly used single-toggle jaw crusher in industry, with simplifications and improvements. It can crush ores of different hardnesses, such as iron ore, copper ore, and limestone. The size of the feed opening is 150×100 mm (length×width), the size of the discharge opening is 10-13 mm, the maximum feed block size is 89 mm, and the size of the crushed ore is about 10 mm. When hand-operated, it can crush 300-400 kg of ore per hour, increasing work efficiency by 10 times compared to manual crushing; when electric, the production rate is 1-1.5 tons per hour, increasing work efficiency by 30-40 times compared to manual crushing.

II. Machine's Operating Principle

The machine consists of a frame, moving jaw, moving jaw liner, fixed jaw, fixed jaw liner, toggle plate, flywheel, eccentric device, adjustment device, and other parts.

The eccentric shaft is rotated by hand or by a motor. Because the moving jaw is sleeved on the eccentric shaft, it produces forward and backward swing, thus crushing the ore entering the crushing chamber composed of the moving jaw, fixed jaw, and side plates.

III. Advantages

1. Simple structure, general small iron factories and machine repair shops can manufacture it; 2. Low cost, each machine costs about 300 yuan; 3. High crushing efficiency, low power consumption. The required motor power is 2 horsepower. In areas lacking electricity, other power sources can be used, such as gas engines, locomotive boilers, hydropower, animal power, etc. Even when hand-operated, the crushing efficiency is higher and more labor-saving than hand hammer crushing.

Hydraulic Ore Crushing Mortar

China has abundant water resources, and using water as power for ore crushing can be realized in many areas of China. Wuxing People's Commune in Bobai County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, uses water mortars for ore crushing.

The structure of the water mortar is very simple, a waterwheel, a wooden shaft, and several wooden mortar bodies. The water drives the waterwheel to rotate, and the wooden shaft also rotates. Wooden sticks are embedded in the wooden shaft, and when the shaft rotates, the wooden sticks press the mortar tail, and the mortar head rhythmically crushes the ore placed on the stone slab.

The size of the waterwheel depends on the height of the water level. Manufacturing a waterwheel with a diameter of 8-12 feet and the 4-8 mortars it drives costs a total of 30 yuan. Such a set of hydraulic ore crushing mortars can crush 8000-9000 jin of ore per day. Workers only need to periodically feed ore and discharge ore, control the size of crushed ore, and the labor intensity is not high, while the work efficiency can be increased by about 10-20 times.

    破碎用机械  省力又省工
    ——介绍几种容易制造，效率高的凿岩、破碎工具和设备
    下面介绍的六种凿岩、破碎土设备，都在生产实践中证明制造容易，效率高，在不用动力操作的情况下可以比手工打钎或手锤破碎效率提高几倍到几十倍，值得推广。
    脚踏打锤机
    这种脚踏打锤机是中国人民解放军铁道兵某部刘德顺同志创造的。其构造如图1所示。这种打锤机可以用两脚代替双手，使人工作业跨上了半机械化的道路。
    打锤机的样子与双杠相似。前腿横穿着一条钢带，是钎子的支架，后腿横安一个坐板，作业时劳动者坐在上面。木架当中安装一个铁锤滚轴，滚轴下面吊着一对踏板，双脚踏板，锤就狠狠地打击钎子，进行穿孔。这种打锤机在硬度12—15的岩石上的打眼效率比人工作业提高一倍。其优点是减轻劳动强度，保证安全。这种打锤机可打水平的、向上倾斜和向下倾斜的炮孔。如果把滚轴的一端安上个摇把，也可以用手摇代替脚踏。
    手拉打锤机
    这种打锤机是由锤、滑板、滑轮、拉绳及支架等部分组成的，如图2所示。滑轮用木制，直径6—7公分，拉绳最好用皮绳。支架内宽24公分，长160公分，高根据要求确定。
    这种打锤机构造很简单。锤上安有四个小轮，在滑板上滑动。锤的一端系一拉绳，绕过滑轮，终端系一拉手。另一端也系一拉绳，终端也系一拉手。工作时，一手用力猛拉绕过滑轮的拉绳，锤子便猛打钎尾，然后用另一手拉锤的另一端拉手，把锤拉回原处，就这样反复拉动进行打眼。
    这种打锤机，在硬度为15的岩石中每小时可打眼50公分，每日可打4公尺。如果在一台上面安二、三个锤，则可在较小断面的巷道中，实现人工打眼的快速掘进。这种简单设备不仅减轻劳动强度，而且工作安全。
    脚踏式打眼机
    脚踏式打眼机是用来向下打眼的设备，适用于露天采矿。这种打眼机是利用冲击力进行凿岩，其构造见图3。钎座装在钎尾上，钎座面上装一导杆，击锤与导杆是滑配，而击锤系在麻绳的一端，麻绳的另一端系在踏板上，且中间绕过导向滑轮（导向滑轮安在三角架上）。工作时由两个工人同时向下踩动踏板，而使击锤上升至一定位置，然后松开踏板，则击锤靠其重力产生动能打击钎座，进行打眼。
    击锤重为30公斤。击锤每打一次，由掌钎工人搬动钎座手柄，使钎子转动一下（每次约45°角）。
    如果采用直径为40公厘的钎子，锤的提升高度为1公尺，每分钟按冲击8次计算，则这种打眼机在致密铁矿石中每班可打4公尺。
    吊弓飞锤破碎机
    河南省偃师县李村乡钢铁兵团在大搞钢铁运动中，为了解放在破碎上所占用的大量劳动力，发动群众创造了一种吊弓飞锤破碎设备。
    吊弓飞锤的构造很简单（见图）。它是由弓架、吊弓、飞锤和底板四个部分组成的。用0.1—0.2公尺粗的圆木搭成一个木架（弓架）；用有弹性的木杆如榆树杆和钢丝做成一个弓形的吊弓，绑在弓架的上横杆上，再用坚硬的岩石凿成方形或圆球形的飞锤，系在吊弓弓弦的中部，在飞锤的下面放一块底板，这便做成了一部吊弓飞锤破碎机。
    吊弓飞锤破碎机分为四种类型：大、中、小型和秤杆形。
    大型设备的锤重600公斤（石锤），弓架高8.5公尺，弓弦长11公尺；中型的锤重250斤（石锤），弓架高6公尺，弓弦长8公尺；小型的锤重80斤（铁锤），架高3公尺，弓弦长5公尺；秤杆形的锤重80斤（铁锤），架高5公尺，弓杆长7公尺。
    这四种类型的设备在构造上没有太大的差异，只是破碎的矿块大小和处理量上有些不同，这要根据具体情况加以选择。
    大型飞锤破碎百斤左右的大矿石，8人一组分两班轮流操作。这种大型飞锤每小时可以碎矿1.45吨，每日可碎矿15吨左右（按10小时计）。过去用手工破碎这么大的矿石，每天只能碎矿110斤，这就是说一部由8人操作的大型飞锤相当于二百多个工的碎矿量，工效提高了几十倍。
    中型飞锤适于破碎30斤左右的矿石，4人一组，每天可碎矿5吨，工作效率比手工碎矿提高20倍。
    小型飞锤和秤杆形飞锤适于破碎小块矿石，由二人操作。每天碎矿1500斤，比手工碎矿提高工效6倍。
    根据李村乡使用吊弓飞锤破碎机的经验总结出五大优点。1、节省劳动力，提高了工作效率。2、制造简单，成本低廉。一部大型飞锤只要47元；中型41.5元；小形和秤杆形的32.4元。3、操作简单，容易掌握。4、生产安全。5、可以破碎大块矿石。
    手摇电动两用颚式破碎机
    合肥工业大学制造成功一种手摇电动两用颚式破碎机。这是一种土洋结合的破碎机，生产实践证明破碎效果良好。
    一、用途和性能
    这种破碎机是根据工业上常用的单肘型颚式破碎机加以简化和改进而设计的。它可以破碎不同硬度的矿石，如铁矿石、铜矿石、石灰石等。给矿口的尺寸为150×100公厘（长×宽），排矿口尺寸10—13公厘，最大给矿块度89公厘，破碎后的矿块大小为10公厘左右。手摇时每小时可以破碎300—400公斤矿石，比手工破碎提高工效10倍；电动时每小时的生产率为1—1.5吨，比人工破碎提高30—40倍。
    二、机器的动作原理
    机器是由机架、动颚、动颚衬板、固定颚、固定颚衬板、肘板、飞轮、偏心装置、调节装置等部分组成的。
    由手摇或电动机带动使偏心轴转动。由于动颚套在偏心轴上，便产生前后摆动，这样把进入动颚、固定颚和侧板组成的碎矿腔中的矿石破碎。
    三、优点
    1、构造简单，一般小的铁工厂和机械修理厂都能制造；2、成本低廉，每部机器约300元左右；3、破碎效率较高，动力消耗少。所需电动机的功率为2马力。缺电的地区可以使用其他动力，如煤气机、锅驼机、水力、畜力等等。即使用手摇，破碎效率也比手锤破碎高，而且省力。
    水力碎矿碓
    我国水利资源丰富，利用水作为动力进行碎矿在我国不少地区都可以实现。广西僮族自治区博白县五星人民公社便是利用水碓来碎矿。
    水碓的构造很简单，一架水车、一根木轴和几个木碓身。水冲动水车转，木轴也就随着转。在木轴上嵌有木棒，轴转时木棒便压碓尾，碓头便有节奏地捣碎放在石板上的矿石。
    水车的大小要看水位的高低来决定。制造一架直径8—12尺的水车和它所带动的4—8个碓，共需30元。这样一套水力碎矿碓每天可以破碎8000—9000斤矿石。工人只需要定期给矿和排矿，掌握碎矿大小，劳动强度不大，同时工作效率可以提高10—20倍左右。（附图片）
