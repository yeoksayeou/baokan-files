Xinhua News Agency, Gar Kunsa, December 11th: A work team dispatched by the CPC Tibet Work Committee, after traversing more than two thousand kilometers of sparsely populated northern Tibetan grasslands, recently arrived in Gar Kunsa, a major town in the Ngari Prefecture of western Tibet. This work team is led by Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Work Committee. They will inspect work and conduct visits in various parts of Ngari.

Ngari is the top of the Tibetan Plateau, with the Himalayas and Kunlun Mountains stretching to the southwest, and the Gangdise Mountains running across it. The average altitude in this area is over 4,000 meters above sea level. For the past eight years, the Tibetan and Han cadres and People's Liberation Army troops here have diligently served the Tibetan people and made contributions to the construction of Tibet.

    西藏工委派工作队访问阿里地区
    新华社噶尔昆沙11日电  中共西藏工委派出的一支工作队，横穿两千多公里人烟稀少的藏北草原，最近已经抵达西藏西部阿里地区的重镇噶尔昆沙。这支工作队由中共西藏工委副书记周仁山率领，他们将在阿里各地检查工作和进行访问。
    阿里是西藏高原的顶部，喜马拉雅山和昆仑山绵亘西南，冈底斯山横贯其中。这个地区拔海平均在四千公尺以上。这里的藏、汉族干部和人民解放军部队，八年来如一日，勤勤恳恳地为西藏人民服务，对西藏的建设事业作出了贡献。
