    "Red Flag" Publishes Report from the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Cadre Meeting
    Resolutely Launch the Struggle to Abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"
    Strengthen the Unity of Patriotic and Democratic Forces Centered on the Working Class
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The "Red Flag" newspaper today published the report of the Central Committee Cadre Meeting unanimously adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, held from November 20th to 23rd.
    The report pointed out that U.S. imperialism, attempting to expand the scope of its aggression against China in order to salvage its strategic inferiority in Asia, has intensified its pressure on Japan, attempting to exploit the ambition of Japanese monopoly capital to revive militarism and bourgeois nationalism, and to transform Japan into an active partner assisting U.S. imperialism in launching atomic war of aggression.
    The report pointed out that the current U.S.-Japan negotiations to revise the "Security Treaty" not only aim to make Japan bear the obligation of defending the U.S. military bases in Japan, maintaining Japan's subordination to the United States, but also to establish a de facto military alliance between Japan, the Syngman Rhee group, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, which would be a serious threat to peace in Asia.
    The report pointed out that Japan is currently still in an economic crisis. Japanese monopoly capital is pushing forward the so-called rationalization movement, attempting to shift the consequences of the economic crisis onto the working people, and is once again vigorously expanding exports to foreign countries in order to ensure its highest profits.
    The report condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for further strengthening its subordinate status to U.S. imperialism and pursuing anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies in order to realize the ambition of monopoly capital, intensifying the revival of imperialism and militarism, suppressing the people's struggle and the trade union movement, creating divisions among the people's figures and the working class, and intensifying the conspiracy to attack and isolate the Japanese Communist Party.
    The report pointed out that, however, while launching struggles demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, opposing the "merit rating" system, and opposing U.S. imperialism's war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region, the Japanese people launched a struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law", dealing a heavy blow to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The report pointed out that in this struggle, the Japanese people strengthened their confidence in fighting the reactionaries; the united action of democratic forces has been further developed, and they have further recognized the goal of the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty". At the same time, this struggle also exposed the militarist and reactionary face of the Kishi Nobusuke government and deepened the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party.
    The report pointed out that, however, because the Japanese Communist Party's influence on trade unions is not yet large enough, it was ultimately unable to realize the unified struggle of all democratic forces, including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, so that it was unable to achieve the goal of dissolving the Diet and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government, and at the same time it was unable to make the people's struggle, which had already forced the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to become an unadjudicated case, continue to develop comprehensively and rapidly.
    In the part of the report on the current central tasks of the Japanese Communist Party, it pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party opposes re-submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to the Diet in any disguised form; opposes the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of the people's movement and the enactment of all anti-democratic laws; at the same time, the Japanese Communist Party resolutely opposes and demands the cessation of the U.S.-Japan negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty", and will further launch the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to promote the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    The report pointed out that the existing U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system itself is a system of war and of subordinating Japan to the United States. Therefore, the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" must become the center of Japan's struggle for peace and independence. At the same time, the struggle against revising and abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" must be closely linked with the struggle to ban nuclear weapons tests and prevent Japan from engaging in nuclear armament, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of the people, preventing the implementation of the "merit rating" system, and establishing a minimum wage system and social security system.
    The report said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Japan, China, Korea, and other Asian countries, as well as the people of the world. The Japanese Communist Party must thoroughly expose this fact, as well as the fact that the Kishi Nobusuke government colludes with U.S. imperialism and undertakes obligations to the United States.
    The report emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity of all patriotic and democratic forces centered on the working class.

### “赤旗报”发表日共中央干部会报告  坚决展开废除日美“安全条约”的斗争  加强以工人阶级为中心的爱国民主力量的团结

    “赤旗报”发表日共中央干部会报告
    坚决展开废除日美“安全条约”的斗争
    加强以工人阶级为中心的爱国民主力量的团结
    据新华社9日讯  东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表了在11月20日到23日举行的日本共产党中央委员会第三次全体会议一致通过的中央委员会干部会的报告。
    报告指出，企图扩大对中国的侵略范围的美帝国主义为了挽救它在亚洲的战略上的劣势，加强了对日本施加的压力，企图利用日本垄断资本复活军国主义的野心和资产阶级民族主义，把日本变成协助美帝国主义发动原子侵略战争的积极伙伴。
    报告指出，日美目前举行的修改“安全条约”的谈判不仅要使日本承担保卫在日本的美军基地的义务维持日本从属于美国的体系，并且要在事实上建立日本、李承晚和蒋介石集团之间的军事同盟，这对亚洲和平将是严重的威胁。
    报告指出，日本目前仍然处于经济危机中。日本的垄断资本则在推进所谓合理化运动，企图把经济危机的后果转嫁到劳动人民身上，并且再度极力向外国扩大出口，以便确保它的最高利润。
    报告谴责岸信介政府为了实现垄断资本的这种野心，进一步加强对美帝国主义的从属地位和推行反苏、反共的政策，加紧复活帝国主义和军国主义，镇压人民的斗争和工会运动，在人民的中间人士和工人阶级之间制造分裂，加紧策划打击和孤立日本共产党的阴谋。
    报告指出，但是，日本人民在展开要求禁止原子弹和氢弹、反对“勤务评定”制度、反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅等斗争的同时，展开了反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争，给予岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党以沉重的打击。报告指出，在这次斗争中，日本人民加强了对反动派进行斗争的信心；民主力量的统一行动有了进一步的发展，并且进一步认识到反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争目标。与此同时，这次斗争还揭露了岸信介政府的军国主义反动面貌，加深了自由民主党内部的矛盾。
    报告指出，但是，由于日本共产党对于工会的影响还不够大，终于没有能够实现包括社会党和共产党在内的全体民主力量的统一斗争，以致没有能够实现解散国会、打倒岸信介政府的目标，同时没有能够使得已经迫使“警察官职务执行法修正案”成为审议未了的案件的人民斗争继续得到全面和迅速的发展。
    报告在日本共产党当前的中心任务部分指出，日本共产党反对以任何改头换面的形式向国会再次提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”；反对岸信介政府镇压人民运动和制定一切反民主的法律；与此同时，日本共产党坚决反对和要求停止日美关于修改“安全条约”的谈判，并且将进一步展开废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，以便促使解散国会和打倒岸信介政府。
    报告指出，目前存在的日美“安全条约”体系本身就是战争和使日本从属于美国的体系，因此，争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争必须成为日本争取和平与独立的斗争的中心。同时，必须使反对修改和废除日美“安全条约”的斗争同争取禁止试验核武器和阻止日本进行核武装、反对岸信介政府镇压人民、阻止推行“勤务评定”制度以及确立最低工资制度和社会保障制度等斗争密切结合起来。
    报告说，美帝国主义是日、中、朝三国和亚洲各国人民以及全世界人民的共同敌人，日本共产党必须彻底揭露这一事实以及岸信介政府同美帝国主义进行勾结和对美国承担义务的事实。
    报告强调了加强以工人阶级为中心的全体爱国民主力量的团结的重要性。
