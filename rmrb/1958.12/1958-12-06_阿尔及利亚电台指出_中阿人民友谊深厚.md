Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 5th. The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station commented on the warm welcome and reception given to the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic in China on the 4th, saying that the Algerian people are not isolated on the battlefield today. Behind the Algerian people, there are free people all over the world. The 600 million great Chinese people stand with the heroic Algerian people who are fighting for freedom and independence.
The commentary said that China is the first Asian country to recognize the Algerian Provisional Government after the Arab countries. The Chinese government has consistently supported the national cause of the Algerian people at various international conferences, and today it has grandly received the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. This shows the deep friendship between the two friendly peoples, and demonstrates China's profound understanding and sympathy for the Algerian people's struggle for liberation and autonomy.
