    The Victory of Launching Mass Movements on a Grand Scale

    More than 100 machinery factories in Liaoning Province, with the vigorous efforts of over 100,000 workers, completed the manufacturing task of metallurgical equipment two months ahead of schedule. The completion of this batch of equipment can increase the national production capacity by more than 5.7 million tons of pig iron and more than 4 million tons of steel annually. This is a good start for launching mass movements on a grand scale on the machinery industry front.

    Some people still do not believe in the power and wisdom of the masses, and often describe large-scale mass movements as "irregular." What they call "regular" is to act according to outdated conventions, to see objects but not people, to sit in the room checking historical data, manipulating calculators, calculating various "quotas," and finding this and that "basis" to deal with the tasks given by the Party and the state. If anyone breaks through their "quotas" and overturns their "basis," they will become emotional and unhappy. However, the law of the development of things always contradicts their ideas. When some people in the Shenyang Fan Factory initially calculated the production capacity of the equipment, they figured that it would take eight years to manufacture 2,000 blowers. Later, they criticized conservative thinking and finally completed the task of 2,000 blowers in just over two months. The difference between mobilizing the masses and not mobilizing the masses, engaging in mass movements and not engaging in mass movements, is so distinctly different.

    There are also some people who often associate mass movements with "trouble." In their view, all reforms in the machinery industry are the responsibility of engineering and technical experts, not something that ordinary people can handle. If such tasks are handed over to the masses for discussion, not only will the key production problems not be solved, but trouble may even arise. However, the workers are vigorously carrying out technical revolution and have solved a large number of technical problems in production. Is that causing trouble? The "ants gnawing bones" and "teapot cooking pig's head" experiences created by the Shenyang workers have solved the contradiction that small equipment in machinery factories cannot handle large tasks. Isn't this mass technical revolution greatly promoting production to leap forward? What trouble can there be? If the great creation of the masses is also regarded as "trouble," then what's wrong with having such "trouble"?

    Liaoning has already achieved great results in the mass movement to rush-produce metallurgical equipment, which is worthy of praise. A powerful industrial base like Liaoning certainly has more potential to tap. As pointed out at the recent Liaoning Industrial Conference, industrial enterprises in Liaoning must continue to launch mass movements on a grand scale, tap potential, and support the whole country. We wish Liaoning new victories in this regard, producing more and better metallurgical equipment to support the whole country.

### 大搞群众运动的胜利

    大搞群众运动的胜利
    辽宁省一百多个机械工厂的十多万职工奋战两个月提前完成了冶金设备的制造任务。这批设备任务的完成，可以为全国增加年产五百七十多万吨生铁和年产四百多万吨钢材的生产能力。这是机械工业战线上大搞群众运动的良好开端。
    现在有些人还不大相信群众的力量和智慧，常常把大规模的群众运动说成是“不正规”。他们所谓“正规”，就是按照陈旧的常规办事，就是见物不见人，坐在屋子里查看历史资料，拨动计算器，算出种种“定额”，找出这样那样的“根据”，来对待党和国家所给予的任务。谁要是冲破他们的“定额”，推翻他们的“根据”，他们就闹情绪，不高兴。但是，事物的发展规律总是和他们的想法相违背。沈阳扇风机厂的一些人开始计算设备生产能力，算来算去，要制造出两千台鼓风机，总得要用八年时间才成。后来，他们批判了保守思想，终于只用了两个多月时间就完成两千台鼓风机任务。发动群众和不发动群众，搞群众运动和不搞群众运动，其差别就是这样截然的不同。
    还有一些人常常把群众运动同“乱子”连在一起。在他们看来，机械工业的一切改革是工程技术专家的事情，不是一般群众能够胜任的。如果把这样的任务交给群众讨论，不仅解决不了生产关键问题，说不定还会弄出乱子来。但是，工人们大闹技术革命，解决了大量的生产中的技术问题，难道是出了乱子吗？沈阳工人创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”、“茶壶煮猪头”的经验，解决了机械工厂的小设备不能干大活的矛盾。这种群众性的技术革命，不是大大推动生产向前跃进吗？这又有什么乱子可出呢？如果把群众的这种伟大创造也看成是“乱子”的话，那末出了这种“乱子”又有什么不好呢？
    辽宁在赶制冶金设备的群众运动中，已经获得了巨大成果，这是值得表扬的。像辽宁这样一个强大的工业基地，当然还有潜力可挖。正如最近召开的辽宁工业会议上所指出的，辽宁各工业企业今后还要大搞群众运动，挖掘潜力，支援全国。我们预祝辽宁在这方面取得新的利胜，生产更多更好的冶金设备，支援全国。
