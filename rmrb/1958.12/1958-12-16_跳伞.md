    Parachuting is an aviation sport that is deeply loved by the vast number of young people in our country.

    The purpose of carrying out parachuting activities is to promote aviation knowledge to the vast number of young people, conduct parachuting training and education, enable the vast number of young people to master the theory and technology of parachuting, improve their patriotic awareness and national defense concepts, and cultivate reserve forces for the country's national defense construction.

    Parachuting can not only train flight personnel and paratroopers for the country, but also serve geological exploration, forest fire prevention, and airdrop disaster relief. Parachuting is also a skill that every aviation personnel must master, and it is a reliable guarantee for saving the lives of aviation personnel. At the same time, parachuting plays an important role in enriching people's material and cultural life, expanding young people's knowledge fields, and developing a strong physique and cultivating heroic and tenacious character.

    Parachuting in our country only started in 1952. At that time, because there were few people, there were not many activities. In 1953, the Central National Defense Sports Association sent people to Chongqing to repair the original old parachute tower and held the first amateur parachuting training class, which trained the first batch of sixty-two amateur parachuting cadres for our country. Since then, the number of participants has gradually increased. In 1954, a new 45-meter-high reinforced concrete parachute tower was built in Beijing. This parachute tower can be used for cable jumping, breakaway jumping, tower jumping, and precision landing jumping. The construction of this parachute tower created experience for the construction of parachute towers in other parts of the country. In 1955, with the strong assistance of the Air Force, a group of airplane parachute athletes were trained. This year, mass hydrogen balloon parachuting activities were carried out in Beijing and Chengdu respectively. This has opened up a path for parachute tower athletes to further participate in airplane parachuting, and solved the intermediate training problem of parachuting.

    At present, in our country, the development of parachute tower jumping is mainly carried out, and hydrogen balloon and airplane parachuting are carried out accordingly. Parachute tower jumping is the foundation of parachuting. It is responsible for the initial parachute training, so that the vast number of young people who love parachuting can master the basic skills and knowledge of parachuting, become familiar with aerial life, enrich their experience in controlling parachutes and landing in the air, and cultivate their love for parachuting, in order to prepare for further parachuting from hydrogen balloons and airplanes.

    In recent years, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, parachuting has become a mass national defense sports project in our country. Dozens of large and small parachute towers have been established in more than 20 cities including Beijing, Chongqing, and Shanghai, and there are already two hydrogen balloon parachuting clubs and one airplane parachuting club. A large number of young people regularly participate in this meaningful activity. Especially in today's situation of everyone being a soldier, parachuting has new developments. For example, Tsinghua University in Beijing organized a paratrooper battalion, Beijing No. 30 Middle School organized a paratrooper company, and 50% of the teachers and students of Northeast Agricultural College in Harbin participated in parachuting activities.

    With the development of parachuting, especially since the Great Leap Forward, parachuting athletes have broken superstitions and liberated their minds, and the technical level of parachuting has improved rapidly. In September this year, parachuting athletes He Jianhua, Geng Guifang, and Cui Xiuying broke the world record of 14.94 meters for the women's daytime 1000-meter group precision landing jump with a score of 9.817 meters from the center point. In November, Cui Xiuying, Li Shuhui, and Li Shuhua broke the world record of 21 meters for the women's daytime 600-meter joint parachuting with an average distance of 12.39 meters from the target center point. In addition, the achievements of some parachuting athletes have reached international levels.

    跳伞运动是我国广大青少年非常热爱的一个航空体育项目。
    开展跳伞运动的目的，是为了向广大青少年宣传航空知识，进行跳伞训练和教育，使广大青少年掌握跳伞的理论和技术，提高他们的爱国主义觉悟和国防观念，为祖国的国防建设培养后备力量。
    跳伞运动不仅能给国家培养飞行人员和伞兵，而且也能为地质勘探、护林防火、空投救灾等工作服务。跳伞也是每个航空人员所必须掌握的技术，它是拯救航空人员生命的可靠保证。同时，跳伞运动对丰富人们的物质文化生活，扩大青少年的知识领域，以及锻炼成健壮的体魄和培养英勇顽强的性格等方面都有重要作用。
    跳伞运动在我国是1952年才开始的。当时因为人少，活动不多。1953年，中央国防体协派人到重庆修复了原有的旧跳伞塔，并举办了第一个业余跳伞训练班，为我国培养了第一批六十二名业余跳伞干部。此后，参加活动的人逐渐增多。1954年，在北京修建了一座四十五公尺高的新型钢筋水泥跳伞塔。这座伞塔可以进行索引跳伞、脱钩跳伞、塔台跳伞和定点着陆跳伞等。这座伞塔的修建为全国其他地方修建伞塔创造了经验。1955年在空军的大力协助下，训练了一批飞机跳伞运动员。今年，在北京和成都两地分别开展了群众性的氢气球跳伞活动。为伞塔跳伞运动员进一步参加飞机跳伞开辟了道路，解决了跳伞运动的中级训练问题。
    目前，在我国基本是以开展伞塔跳伞为主，相应的开展氢气球和飞机跳伞。伞塔跳伞是跳伞运动的基础，它负担着初级跳伞的训练，使广大爱好跳伞的青少年，通过伞塔跳伞，掌握跳伞的基本技术和知识，熟悉空中生活，丰富在空中操纵降落伞和着陆等经验，培养他们热爱跳伞运动，为进一步从氢气球和飞机上跳伞作好准备。
    几年来由于党和政府的重视，跳伞运动在我国已成为具有群众性的一个国防体育项目。在北京、重庆、上海等二十多个城市建立了几十座大小跳伞，并已有了两个氢气球跳伞俱乐部和一个飞机跳伞俱乐部。大批青少年经常参加这项有意义的活动。特别是在全民皆兵的今天，跳伞运动有了新的发展。如北京清华大学组织了伞兵营，北京三十中学组织了伞兵连，哈尔滨东北农学院全校有50％的师生参加跳伞活动。
    随着跳伞运动的开展，特别是大跃进以来，跳伞运动员破除迷信，思想解放了，跳伞运动的技术水平提高很快。在今年9月跳伞运动员赫建华、耿桂芳、崔秀英以距中心点九点八一七公尺的成绩，打破了十四点九四公尺的女子日间一千公尺集体定点着陆跳伞的世界纪录。11月，崔秀英、李淑惠、李淑花又以平均距靶中心点十二点三九公尺的成绩打破二十一公尺的女子日间六百公尺联合跳伞世界纪录。另外，还有一些跳伞运动员的成绩达到了国际水平。
