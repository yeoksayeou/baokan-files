    "Chenghai Thousand-Grain Seed"
    (Reported by this newspaper) Through five years of dedicated research, farm workers in Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, using Michurin's method of directional cultivation and systematic selection, finally cultivated a superior rice variety this year that yields 935 grains per ear. This rice variety has been named "Chenghai Thousand-Grain Seed." The rice stalks are as thick as fingers and completely resistant to lodging.
    This rice variety was bred by hybridizing the "Golden Gourd" rice variety as the female parent and the "White Husk Dwarf" as the male parent. Technicians such as Zeng Xuchuang and other workers who cultivated this rice variety were bold in their thinking and actions, and overcame various technical difficulties during the experiments. For example, generally, early-season rice begins to flower at 9:00 AM. If hot water is used to emasculate the female parent, it must be done before the female parent naturally flowers. If emasculation is done too early and the temperature conditions are not suitable, the male parent will not flower. Furthermore, the flowering time of the female parent is very short. Under these circumstances, the female parent often does not bear fruit because there is no male pollen available for pollination. During the early season last year, Zeng Xuchuang learned from books that some people used darkrooms to emasculate the female parent during rice hybridization, the principle being that darkness can stimulate rice flowering. Zeng Xuchuang was inspired by this and conducted experiments using local methods. Two hours before the rice naturally flowered, he covered the rice with a pair of black trousers. After five minutes, the rice indeed flowered. Now, they can obtain pollen at any time within two to three hours before the rice naturally flowers, and the efficiency of hybridization work has increased threefold compared to the past.

    “澄海千粒种”
    本报讯  广东省澄海县农场职工运用米丘林定向培育和系统选择的方法，经过五年的钻研，终于在今年育成了每穗结谷九百三十五粒的优良稻种。这个稻种被命名为“澄海千粒种”。稻秆粗如手指，具有完全抗倒的能力。
    这个稻种是以水稻品种“金葫芦”作母本，“白壳矮”作父本杂交育成的。培育这个稻种的技术员曾叙创等职工，敢想敢干，在试验过程中曾经克服了技术上的各种困难。例如，一般早造水稻在一天中开花的时间是从上午九时开始的，若用温汤对母本进行杀雄，又须在母本自然开花前进行；如果杀雄过早，温度条件未适合，就会遇到父本不开花；而母本的花，开放时间又很短；在这种情况下，往往因为没有父本花粉可授而致母本不结实。去年早造，曾叙创从书本上知道有人在水稻杂交时利用暗室来进行母本去雄，它的原理是黑暗可以刺激水稻开花。曾叙创从这里得到启发，于是用土办法进行试验，在水稻自然开花前二小时，用一条黑色的裤子把水稻遮盖起来，经五分钟后，水稻果然开了花。现在，他们已经能够在水稻自然开花前二至三小时内的任何时间获得花粉，而且进行杂交的工作，效率比过去提高三倍。
