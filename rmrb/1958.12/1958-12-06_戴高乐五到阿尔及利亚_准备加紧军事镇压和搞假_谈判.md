Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Algiers Dispatch: French Prime Minister De Gaulle arrived in Algeria yesterday for a five-day "inspection," his fifth visit to Algeria since becoming Prime Minister of France.

　　Today, he inspected French colonial military installations in Bone, northeastern Algeria, and discussed the military situation in Algeria with local French officials.

　　According to French newspapers, De Gaulle's purpose in coming to Algeria this time is far from wanting a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue, but rather to formulate measures to attempt to "solve the military problem." Sources say that De Gaulle will appoint Maurice Challe, an aide to Salan, as the commander of the French army in Algeria. Challe advocates adopting so-called "rapid and severe strikes" with "new tactics" against the Algerian National Liberation Army to continue the Algerian war fanatically.

　　It is reported that during his stay in Algeria, De Gaulle will also meet with Algerian parliamentarians recently "elected" under French bayonets. The De Gaulle government has been trying to use these people as counterparts to "negotiate" the status of Algeria with the French government. De Gaulle will also visit major industrial areas of Algeria and the oil regions of the Sahara to inspect enterprises established there by French monopoly capital.

    戴高乐五到阿尔及利亚
    准备加紧军事镇压和搞假“谈判”
    新华社4日讯  阿尔及尔消息：法国总理戴高乐昨天来到阿尔及利亚作为期五天的“视察”，这是他担任法国总理以来第五次来到阿尔及利亚。
    今天他在阿尔及利亚东北部的波尼视察了法国殖民军在那里的军事设施，并且同当地的法国官员讨论阿尔及利亚的军事局势。
    据法国报纸报道，戴高乐这次来到阿尔及利亚的目的远不是想要和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，而是要制定一些措施来企图“解决军事问题”。有消息说，戴高乐将任命萨兰的助手莫里斯·夏尔为阿尔及利亚的法军司令，而夏尔是主张采取所谓“急速严重打击”阿尔及利亚民族解放军的“新战术”来疯狂地继续进行阿尔及利亚战争的。
    据报道，戴高乐在阿尔及利亚期间也将同最近在法国刺刀下举行的“选举”中当选的阿尔及利亚议员会晤。戴高乐政府一直企图把这些人作为法国政府“谈判”阿尔及利亚地位问题的对手。戴高乐还将到阿尔及利亚的主要工业区和撒哈拉的石油地区去视察法国垄断资本在那里兴办的企业。
