Mao Zedong's Writings Gave Me Strength
Wang Peixia

I am a resident of Jiaxi District, Jiamusi City, a 53-year-old urban poor person who had no schooling in the past. In 1953, I participated in a literacy class and graduated in 1954. After graduation, I began to study Mao Zedong's writings, and so far I have finished reading the first volume and the first half of the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "A History of the Chinese Revolution," among other books. In addition, I often read important editorials and articles in newspapers and periodicals such as "People's Daily," "Heilongjiang Daily," and "Red Flag."

After I was elected as the director of the residents' committee in 1954, I found it very difficult to publicize and explain the Party's policies to the masses. In the past, when the work tasks were heavy, I would rather not sleep, and sometimes even forget to eat, and actively do the work, being exhausted all day. But in my work, I often ran into obstacles, and some people would avoid me and walk away when they saw me, not wanting to get close to me. Once, when I was explaining the conscription law to the residents, I sincerely wanted to explain it well, but I couldn't explain the reasons for implementing the conscription law, and I felt very sad. I knew this was because my theoretical level was low. Although I wanted to study theory, others said I didn't have the conditions to study theory, and my thoughts were in turmoil. At that time, I was very anxious and asked the leaders to teach me the tricks to complete the task. The leaders said to me, "Learn from the masses, learn from books, study Mao Zedong's writings, there are no other tricks." I said, "I am old, what's the point of studying?" The leaders said, "You have to learn as long as you live! You can't do a good job without studying political theory." After ideological struggle, finally, I listened to the leaders and started studying Mao Zedong's writings, and was immediately attracted by the vivid content in the articles. When I finished reading "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," I thought, this time I have found a working method to complete the task, so I became more and more interested in learning, studying from early morning to late at night, often until one or two o'clock in the morning. Sometimes I fell asleep, opened my eyes and opened the book to study again. My spirit of learning also motivated many young people nearby to actively study theory. Some neighbors said to me, "You are so old, you have been running around all day to do things for everyone, and you still study late at night, you should rest." I said, "In order to do a good job, how can we do without studying theory? To learn theory well, we must put in some hard work. In the past, the Red Army marched north to resist Japan for us, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, overcoming so many difficulties. Now we are so happy, serving the people, what difficulties are we afraid of in studying?" When I encountered unfamiliar characters and difficult words in my studies, I would look them up in the dictionary, and sometimes I still didn't recognize them after looking them up in the dictionary, so I would ask everyone I met.

I went to study theory in order to solve problems in my work. In the four years of theoretical study, I closely linked each article with my own thoughts and work. Because the learning method was correct, the gains were great.

Before, I didn't know how to follow the mass line. When the higher authorities assigned tasks, I didn't mobilize the masses, but worked alone, which made my back ache and my legs sore, and I still couldn't complete the task. For example, when the patriotic health campaign was launched in 1955, I simply issued a general call, but no one did anything, so I criticized them sternly. For example, Jiang Guilan's home was not hygienic, so I criticized her severely, and as a result, we quarreled. She said, "I'll just do the sanitation like this, see what you can do to me." Our health work was not done well, and the masses of other residents' committees came to our committee to dig pupae, which made me feel very ashamed. Later, after reading Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," I realized that the power of the masses is very great. I didn't see the power of the masses as so great in the past. I examined the shortcomings of coercion and commandism and being divorced from the masses in my work style, and understood that only by relying on the masses, uniting and educating the masses, can we do a good job. Later, I changed my work style, relied on the masses, and the work tasks were completed smoothly. When the patriotic health campaign was launched in 1956, I first convened a cadre meeting, and everyone came up with ideas, and then thoroughly publicized the great significance of carrying out health work to the masses, and also adopted the method of cadres taking the lead in helping individual residents, which completed the task very well. For example, I helped Jiang Guilan clean up, which moved her to do a very good job in hygiene. Because I followed the mass line in my work, the health work that year was done well, and the residents' committee became a health model unit, and also received a prize banner, and I and the cadres were rated as models. From then on, no matter what I did, I paid attention to following the mass line.

After studying Mao Zedong's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," my eyes became brighter: I distinguished between enemies and friends. In the past, I didn't know how to look at problems from a class point of view, and I couldn't figure out internal and external contradictions, who was family and who was an outsider (enemy). At that time, I always thought that some poor peasants were naughty and unwilling to go to work, and that they were bad elements, while the landlord and fake policeman Wang Qingju (now arrested) would do whatever he was told, and I thought he was a good person. This was confusing the enemy and ourselves, recognizing the enemy as our own. Once, a resident was selected as a cadre at the grassroots level, but he refused to do it, and secretly said, "Kill me, I won't do work for you." At that time, I didn't understand what was going on, and thought he was complaining. Later, after analyzing it with the class analysis method, I understood: he was a rich peasant who had been struggled against during the land reform. After further understanding, he also spread some anti-Party remarks. Measuring him with the six political criteria proposed by Mao Zedong, I understood: he and we are of two minds, it is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. After mastering the theory of class analysis, during the transformation of the five types of elements, I not only actively struggled against the bad element Lü Bingwen, but also closely contacted and mobilized the masses, and assisted the government in digging out some counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and received praise and rewards from the People's Government. I also knew how to apply the methods of persuasion, education, gentle breeze, and fine rain to deal with internal problems of the people. Therefore, the relationship with the masses was closer, and the masses were very affectionate when they saw me, and they all happily told me their innermost thoughts. After the establishment of the People's Commune, I felt particularly happy. Although I am over fifty years old, I feel like I am still in my youth, and I don't know what fatigue is when I work. Now, we have established a Mao Zedong Thought study group, with nine people and me studying Mao Zedong's writings together. I am the leader of this group, and now I have even more enthusiasm for learning. In the future, even if I am old and deaf and blind and unable to study, I will encourage the younger generation to study political theory well. Because the four years of theoretical study have made me deeply realize that Mao Zedong's writings have given me endless strength.

### 毛主席著作给了我力量

    毛主席著作给了我力量
    王佩霞
    我是佳木斯市佳西区居民，今年五十三岁，城市贫民，过去没念过书。1953年我参加了扫盲班学习，1954年毕业。毕业后，开始学习毛主席著作，到现在已经读完了“毛泽东选集”第一卷和第二卷前半部，“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和“中国革命史”等书。此外，还经常阅读“人民日报”，“黑龙江日报”，“红旗”等报纸刊物上的重要社论和文章。
    我在1954年被选为居民委员会主任之后，感到向群众宣传解释党的方针政策很吃力。过去当工作任务繁重时，宁肯不睡觉，甚至有时忘掉吃饭，积极地干工作，一天累得够呛。但在工作中还经常碰钉子，有的群众遇见我就绕弯走过去，不和我接近。有一次向街道居民讲兵役法时，从心眼里想把它讲好，但是对为什么要实行兵役法的道理就讲不出来，觉得很难过。我知道这是因为自己理论水平低的缘故，虽然有心学学理论，但别人说不具备学习理论的条件，我的思想就七上八下的斗争着。当时很焦急，曾要求领导教给完成任务的窍门。领导同志对我说：“向群众学习，向书本学习，学习毛主席著作，没有别的窍门”。我说：“我都老了，还学个啥劲呢？”领导说：“活到老，要学到老啊！不学习政治理论就作不好工作”。经过思想斗争，最后，我听了领导的话，学习起毛主席的著作来，并且立刻被文章里的生动内容吸引住了。当我读完“关心群众生活注意工作方法”一文时，我想，这回可找到了完成任务的工作方法了，就越学越有兴趣，起早贪黑的学，经常学到深夜一、两点钟。有时睡着，睁开眼打开书又学。我的这种学习精神，也推动了附近很多青年积极地学起理论来。有的邻居对我说：“那么大年纪了，白天为大家办事跑了一天，还贪黑学习，应该休息一下了”。我说：“为了作好工作，不学习理论哪能行呢？要学好理论必须下点苦工夫。过去红军为咱们北上抗日，爬雪山，过草地，那么大困难都克服了，现在多幸福，为人民服务，学习还怕啥困难呢？”在学习中碰到生字、难词，就查字典，有时查字典还不认识，就逢人便问。
    我是为了解决工作中的问题才去学习理论的。在四年来的理论学习中，每学一篇文章都紧密地和自己思想、工作联系起来。由于学习方法对头，收获很大。
    以前我不会走群众路线，上级布置下来任务，我不发动群众，竟自己单干，累得腰疼腿酸，还完不成任务。像1955年开展爱国卫生运动时，我单纯地一般号召一下，谁家都不搞，我就厉声厉色地批评他们。如姜桂兰家里卫生不好，我就把她狠狠地批评了一顿，结果吵起来了。她说，卫生就搞这样，看你能把我整到哪去。我们卫生工作没搞好，其他居民委员会群众都到我们委员会来挖蛹，当时把我臊得够呛。后来读了毛主席写的“湖南农民运动考察报告”，才认识到了群众力量是大得很哪。过去没有把群众力量看得那么大。我检查了在工作作风上的强迫命令和脱离群众的缺点，明白了只有依靠群众，团结教育群众，才能做好工作。后来我转变了工作作风，依靠了群众，工作任务就顺利完成了。1956年开展爱国卫生运动时，我首先召开干部会，大家想办法，出主意，然后向群众深入宣传了开展卫生工作的重大意义，对个别居民还采取了干部带头帮助他们搞的办法，就很好地完成了任务。如我帮助姜桂兰打扫卫生，感动了她把卫生搞得很好。因为工作中走了群众路线，那年的卫生工作搞好了，居民委员会变成了卫生模范单位，还得了奖旗，我和干部都被评为模范。从这以后，无论干什么工作，我都注意走群众路线了。
    我学习了毛主席的“中国社会各阶级的分析”和“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”之后，眼睛更亮了：分清了敌人和朋友。过去不会用阶级观点去看问题，弄不清楚内部和外部矛盾，谁是自己家里人，谁是外人（敌人）。那时总认为有些贫农调皮捣蛋，派工不愿去，就是坏分子，而地主、伪警察王庆举（现已被逮捕）叫他干啥，他干啥，我就认为是好人。这是敌我不分，认敌为我。有一次基层选一个居民当干部，他不干，背地里又说：“杀死我也不给你们干工作”。当时未弄清楚是怎么回事，以为他发牢骚。后来用阶级分析方法一分析就明白了：他是富农，在土改时被斗过。经过深入了解，他还散布了一些反党言论。用毛主席提的六条政治标准一衡量，明白了：他和我们是两条心，是敌我矛盾。我掌握了阶级分析这一理论后，在改造五类分子期间，不但积极向坏分子吕丙文作斗争，而且又密切联系群众和发动群众，协助政府挖出一些反、坏分子，受到了人民政府的表扬和奖励。对处理人民内部问题也知道应用说服教育和风细雨的方法。因而密切了群众关系，群众见着我也很亲热，都乐呵呵的讲出心里话。人民公社成立后感到特别高兴，我虽然五十多岁了，好似还在年轻时候一样，干起工作来，不知道累。现在，我们已成立了学习毛泽东著作学习小组，有九名群众和我一同学习毛主席著作，我是这个小组的组长，现在学习劲头更高了。将来就是老得耳聋眼花不能学习时，也要鼓励青年一代好好学习政治理论。因为四年来的理论学习，使我深深体会到：毛主席著作给了我无穷无尽的力量。
