    Jottings
    The Eyes of the Decadent
    U.S. Senator Humphrey, who recently visited the Soviet Union, slandered the Soviet Union's seven-year national economic development plan in a speech after returning to the United States, saying that this plan was "part of the Cold War." The Soviet people are marching forward proudly to develop their economy, but it is actually said to be "Cold War." Humphrey's argument can be described as the most absurd slander of the West against the Soviet "Seven-Year Plan."
    What is Humphrey's basis? The U.S. Senator said: "Every time I talk to the Russians, they always talk about how things will be tomorrow. Therefore, their five-year plan and seven-year plan...are actually psychological plans."
    Humphrey's ridiculous logic is not worth refuting. And it is not surprising that Humphrey would say such a thing. The decadent always only love to reminisce about the past, only the newly born look forward to the future with full confidence. And the former obviously cannot understand the latter's mood.
  Truly "Too Stupid"
    The Philippine delegation to the Asian-African Economic Conference attempted to engage in a "two Chinas" conspiracy and was severely condemned by our representative. Failing to make trouble, they became angry and withdrew from the conference, and even threatened that if the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee groups were not allowed to participate, they would not attend the next Asian-African Economic Conference.
    The Philippine representative's withdrawal from the meeting after their "two Chinas" conspiracy failed shows that their purpose in going to Cairo was not to discuss economic cooperation with other Asian and African countries, but to fulfill a different mission. Therefore, their departure is not at all regrettable for the Asian-African Economic Conference.
    As for their threat: If the next conference does not allow the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee groups to participate, the Philippines will not participate either. This further proves that our delegation leader Nan Hanchen's rebuke of them as "too stupid" was not at all unfair. The Philippine representatives link their fate with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. Isn't that the stupidest thing imaginable? If the Philippine rulers really want to take a stand of advancing and retreating with the likes of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, then their chances of participating in international conferences will become fewer and fewer.

    札记
    末落者的眼光
    最近曾到苏联访问的美国参议员汉弗莱回到美国以后，在一次演说中竟诽谤苏联的七年国民经济发展计划，说什么这个计划是“冷战的一部分”。苏联人民昂首阔步地要发展自己的经济，居然被说成是“冷战”，汉弗莱论调亦可谓是西方对苏联“七年计划”的各种诽谤中之最荒谬者矣。
    汉弗莱的根据是什么呢？这位美国参议员说：“每次我跟俄国人谈话的时候，他总是谈明天如何如何，因此他们的五年计划和七年计划……实际上是心理计划”。
    汉弗莱的这种可笑的逻辑是不值一驳的。而汉弗莱所以会说出这样的话，也是不足为奇的。末落者总是只爱怀念过去，只有新生者才会满怀信心瞻望未来。而后者的这种心情显然是前者所无法理解的。
  真是“太愚蠢了”
    菲律宾出席亚非经济会议的代表团企图搞“两个中国”的阴谋遭到我国代表的痛斥，捣蛋未成竟恼羞成怒，退出会议，而且还扬言如果不让蒋介石和李承晚集团参加，他们就不出席下届亚非经济会议。
    菲律宾代表搞“两个中国”阴谋未得逞便要退会，这说明他们到开罗去目的并不是要和其他亚非国家讨论经济合作的问题，而是别有使命。因此他们的离去，对于亚非经济会议来说是丝毫不值得惋惜的。
    至于他们所提出的要挟：下届会议不让蒋介石和李承晚集团参加，菲律宾也不参加，这就更证明，我国代表团团长南汉宸斥责他们“太愚蠢了”，一点也没冤枉他们。菲律宾的代表把自己的命运和蒋介石、李承晚连结在一起，难道不是最蠢不可及的事情？如果菲律宾的统治者真的要采取和蒋介石、李承晚之流同进退的立场，那末他们参加国际会议的机会就会是越来越少了。
