Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch—The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Silicate Society recently held the first National Experience Exchange Conference on Glass Fiber and Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic in Shanghai. It was determined to accelerate the development of the glass fiber industry and share the tasks of steel, wood, and cotton yarn. Two hundred and three representatives from relevant production and scientific research units across the country participated in this conference. Through on-site visits, special reports, and group discussions, they extensively exchanged experiences in using indigenous methods to produce glass fiber and fiberglass reinforced plastic. The current task of the glass fiber industry was clarified: it is necessary to vigorously promote mass movements and build indigenous fiber drawing machines on a large scale, so that this emerging materials industry will blossom everywhere across the country.

Chen Yuntao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, said at the meeting that accelerating the development of the glass fiber industry is an urgent requirement of many industrial sectors. Using glass fiber as raw material can save steel in construction, machinery, and other departments. Glass fiber has a lighter weight than steel, a higher tensile strength than steel, and good temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and electrical insulation. Therefore, after using glass fiber products to replace steel bars in concrete, gauze in motors, and manufacturing car bodies and small boat hulls, it will inevitably cause a series of technological revolutions in many industrial sectors such as construction, machinery, and electrical engineering, making product materials more economical, quality higher, and production processes simpler. Chen Yuntao asked the representatives to break superstitions, liberate their minds, mobilize the masses, and make preparations immediately after returning, striving to start mass production of various glass fibers in the first quarter of next year to share part of the construction tasks of products such as steel, wood, and cotton yarn.

The meeting believes that the experience of Tianjin No. 5 Glass Factory in successfully testing the drawing of medium-grade glass fiber with a semi-gas small pool furnace, and the experience of Tsinghua University in Beijing in successfully researching the drawing of medium-grade glass fiber with a dry-distilled gas small pool furnace, are worth popularizing throughout the country. The Tianjin method can be used without electricity and is suitable for promotion in rural people's communes; the Beijing method can be developed into comprehensive utilization of coal and gas, suitable for production in larger factories at the county level.

The representatives believed that the experiences of two factories in Shanghai are also worth learning. Shanghai Xinmei Glass Fiber Factory uses clay crucibles to draw high-grade glass fiber and spin it into yarn and weave it into cloth; Shanghai Kaixuan Glass Factory directly extracts glass fiber from the pool furnace for producing glass marbles.

Glass fiber uses glass as raw material, and the raw materials for glass are sand, stone, and clay, which are available everywhere and can be said to be inexhaustible. Moreover, glass fiber has many advantages. Therefore, many industrially advanced countries have spared no effort in developing this special materials industry in recent years.

China's glass fiber industry has developed during this year's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. In just a few months, various places have broken through the limitations of platinum crucibles and used indigenous machines and indigenous equipment to draw medium-grade and high-grade glass fiber.

    玻璃纤维用途大  顶上钢铁和棉纱
    建筑工程部提出：玻璃纤维工业大有前途
    据新华社上海电  建筑工程部和中国矽酸盐学会筹备委员会，最近在上海召开了第一次全国玻璃纤维和玻璃钢的经验交流会，确定加速发展玻璃纤维工业，分担钢铁、木材和棉纱的任务。参加这次会议的全国二百零三个有关生产和科学研究单位的代表，通过现场参观、专题报告和分组讨论，广泛地交流了用土法生产玻璃丝和玻璃钢等的经验，明确了当前玻璃纤维工业的任务是，必须大搞群众运动，大造土拉丝机，使这个新兴的材料工业在全国各地遍地开花。
    建筑工程部副部长陈云涛在会上说，加速发展玻璃纤维工业，是当前许多工业部门迫切的要求。用玻璃纤维作原料，可以使建筑、机械等部门节约钢材。玻璃纤维具有体重比钢轻，抗拉强度比钢高，有良好的耐温、防腐和电气绝缘性。因此，用玻璃纤维制品代替混凝土里的钢筋、电动机里的纱布、制造汽车车身和小船船壳等以后，势必在建筑、机械和电机等许多工业部门引起一连串的技术革命，使产品用料更省、质量更高、生产过程更简化。陈云涛要求代表们破除迷信，解放思想，发动群众，回去后马上作好准备，争取明年一季度开始就能够大量生产各种玻璃纤维，分担钢铁、木材、棉纱等产品的一部分建设任务。
    会议认为天津市第五玻璃厂试验成功的用半煤气小池炉拉制中级玻璃丝的经验，北京清华大学研究成功的用干馏煤气小池炉拉制中级玻璃丝的经验，值得在全国各地普遍推广。天津的方法可以不用电力，适宜于乡村人民公社推广；北京的方法可以发展成综合利用煤和煤气，适宜县一级较大型工厂里生产。
    代表们认为上海两个工厂的经验也很值得学习。上海新美玻璃纤维厂用陶土坩锅拉出高级玻璃丝，并纺成纱、织成布；上海凯旋玻璃厂在生产玻璃弹子的池炉里直接提出玻璃丝。
    玻璃纤维用玻璃做原料，玻璃的原料是沙子、石头、粘土，各地都有，可以说是取之不尽、用之不绝，而且玻璃纤维又有很多优越性。因此许多工业先进的国家近几年来都不遗余力地发展这一项特殊的材料工业。
    我国玻璃纤维工业是在今年工农业大跃进中发展起来的。在短短几个月中，各地冲破了白金坩锅的限制，用土机器、土设备拉出了中级和高级玻璃纤维。
