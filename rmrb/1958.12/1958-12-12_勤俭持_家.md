    Frugally Manage the "Home"
    Lin Shi
    Nowadays, if you say, "Grain consumption should be planned," some people will definitely ask, "Isn't this year's grain harvest a bumper one? Why emphasize planning so much!" Yes, this year's grain harvest has been a bumper one, and many people's communes have even implemented a "free meals" grain supply system. It seems that there is no need to emphasize planning!

    But that's not right; this idea is wrong. After this year's bumper harvest, the problem of whether there is enough grain to eat has been basically solved, so many places have relaxed the standards of planned supply. However, this does not mean that there should be no more planning, especially that we should not continue to advocate thrift. The reason is simple: first, on a national scale, some places have an average of one thousand jin of grain per person, while others have less than one thousand jin, such as eight hundred jin or five hundred jin. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to saving grain, then grain may still be tight in these areas. Second, grain is the "treasure of treasures," the wealth of the country. Even if the grain problem is completely solved, we cannot waste it. A people's commune has tens of thousands of people; if each person wastes one jin of grain, that is tens of thousands of jin. Conversely, if each person saves one jin of grain, that is saving tens of thousands of jin. This is a very large number.

    Some people will also ask, "Didn't you say to eat with an open belly?" Yes, after a bumper harvest, we should eat a little more, but this does not contradict planned grain consumption. Planned grain consumption is about two aspects: one is that even though the grain harvest is a bumper one, there must still be a plan for the entire commune's grain consumption, how much each person eats on average, and how much each person eats on average each month, so as to prevent waste. Some canteens now have serious waste problems because they lack planning. The other is to use every grain for necessary production and life. We must eat our fill, but we must never waste. Planned grain consumption is not about telling everyone not to eat or to eat less; rather, it is about saving and cherishing grain under the condition of eating our fill.

    Some people still think this way: "Since we have implemented the supply system, the commune is responsible after we eat." This idea is of course wrong. This is drawing a line between the commune and oneself, as if the commune is not one's own. Whose is the commune? Of course, it belongs to everyone. Wasting the commune's grain is wasting one's own grain. If the big river has no water, the small river dries up. If the commune has no grain, then one will have no grain to eat.

    The commune is one's own home, but it is not the small home of the past, but everyone's home. Since it is everyone's home, we should cherish this home as we did in the past and practice frugality in managing the "home". Planned grain consumption is one of the ways to practice frugality in managing the home.

    勤俭持“家”
    林时
    现在说：“用粮要有计划”，一定会有人问：“今年粮食不是大丰收了吗？何必还要如此强调计划！”是的，今年粮食大丰收了，许多人民公社还实行了“吃饭不要钱”的粮食供给制了。看样子，可以不必强调计划了！
    其实不然，这种想法是错误的。今年大丰收以后，粮食够不够吃这个问题已经得到了基本解决，因此许多地方已经放宽了计划供应的标准。但是，这并不是说不应该再有计划了，特别是不应该再提倡节约了。道理很简单：首先从全国范围来说的，有的地方每人的平均粮食达到了一千斤，有的地方不到一千斤，是八百斤，五百斤。因此，如果不注意节约粮食，那么这些地区的粮食还是可能紧张的。其次粮食是“宝中之宝”，是国家的财富，即使粮食完全解决了，也不能浪费。一个人民公社有几万人，一人浪费一斤粮食，就是几万斤。反之，一人节约一斤粮食，就是节约几万斤。这是一个很大的数字。
    又会有人问：“你们不是说放开肚皮吃饭吗？”是的，丰收了，应该多吃一点，但这与计划用粮并不矛盾。计划用粮是从两个方面来说的，一是说，粮食虽然丰收了，对于全社的用粮仍须有个计划，每个人平均吃多少，每个月平均吃多少，这样，才可以防止发生浪费现象。现在有的食堂就因为缺少计划，浪费现象很严重。一是要把每颗粮食，用到必须的生产和生活上去。饭要吃饱，但是决不能浪费。计划用粮并不是要大家不吃饭，少吃饭；而是在吃饱饭的条件下，大家来节约粮食，爱护粮食。
    现在还有人这样想：“既然实行供给制了，吃过了，由公社负责。”这种想法当然是错误的。这是在公社和自己之间划一条沟，好像公社不是自己的。公社是谁的呢？当然是大家的。浪费公社的粮食，就是浪费自己的粮食。大河没水小河干，公社没有粮食，自己也就没粮食吃。
    公社是自己的家，不过不是过去的小家，而是大家。既然是大家，就应当像过去一样的爱护这个家，实行勤俭持“家”。计划用粮，就是勤俭持家方法之一。
