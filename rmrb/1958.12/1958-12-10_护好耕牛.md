    Protect the Draught Cattle
    Draught cattle are the treasure of farmers,
    We should protect them well,
    Keep the stalls clean every day,
    Provide fodder day and night!
    Lead the cattle to drink water promptly,
    Treat illnesses as soon as they are discovered.

    护好耕牛
    耕牛本是农家宝，
    我们应该保护好，
    栏里天天扫干净，
    日夜都要有饲料！
    牵牛饮水要及时，
    发现疾病早治疗。
        （湖南安化）
