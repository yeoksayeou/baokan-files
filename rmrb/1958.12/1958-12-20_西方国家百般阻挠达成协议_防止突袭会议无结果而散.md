    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, December 18th. Due to the obstruction of Western countries, the conference on preventing surprise attacks held in Geneva adjourned today after holding thirty formal meetings, without reaching any agreement.

    A communiqué issued after the meeting today stated that the exchange of views had helped to clarify each party's views; the representatives attending the meeting agreed to adjourn for Christmas and New Year and to report to their respective governments. The communiqué did not mention a date for resumption, but said that the conference representatives hoped to resume discussions on the issue of preventing surprise attacks as soon as possible.

    The Soviet representative suggested resuming discussions before January 15, 1959, but this was rejected by the West. Observers here believe that the West is unwilling to set a date for resumption because they have realized that the conference cannot achieve their goal of collecting intelligence on the latest weapons and freely entering the territory of socialist countries. At the same time, the West also wants to avoid exposing their intention to not reach an agreement on methods and means of preventing surprise attacks. The West adopts this attitude because they are afraid that reaching an agreement would ease international tensions, which are the foundation of their Cold War policy.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuzov, held a press conference here this afternoon. He said that due to the attitude adopted by Western countries, the conference on preventing surprise attacks failed to complete the main task of reporting practical measures to the governments concerned for preventing such surprise attacks.

    Kuzov said: "The issue of surprise attacks is a direct result of the Cold War and the arms race policy. The Cold War and the arms race policy have sown the seeds of distrust and suspicion between governments, thus creating a situation in which one country regards another as a potential enemy."

    Kuzov listed the proposals made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries' delegations on issues such as the agenda, prohibiting aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from flying over the airspace and high seas of other countries, establishing ground observation posts, and aerial photography systems. These proposals showed the East's sincere desire to reach an agreement. He also exposed the West's attitude of refusing to discuss these issues on the pretext that the meeting was of a technical nature.

    Kuzov pointed out that Western countries are attempting to collect materials on the defense and combat capabilities of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, thereby intensifying the arms race; while socialist countries do not want to engage in an arms race and are trying to reach an agreement on specific measures to prevent surprise attacks.

    He said that socialist countries will make unremitting efforts so that the issue of preventing surprise attacks can be resolved positively. If Western countries change their current negative attitude, if their representatives also hold the same sincere desire as the representatives of socialist countries, then it is possible to find specific measures in the short term to prevent the danger of surprise attacks and reduce the risk of another war. He concluded that this would be an important step towards ensuring peace and creating favorable conditions for developing international cooperation. (Attached picture)

### 西方国家百般阻挠达成协议  防止突袭会议无结果而散

    西方国家百般阻挠达成协议
    防止突袭会议无结果而散
    新华社日内瓦18日电  由于西方国家的阻挠，在日内瓦举行的防止突然袭击会议在举行了三十次正式会议之后，今天宣告休会，会议没有达成任何协议。
    今天会后，发表的公报说，交换意见有助于澄清每一方的观点；参加会议的代表同意在圣诞节和新年休会，向各该国政府汇报。公报没有提到复会日期，只是说，会议代表希望尽早恢复关于防止突然袭击问题的讨论。
    苏联代表建议在1959年1月15日之前恢复讨论，但是遭到西方的拒绝。这里的观察家认为，西方不愿意确定复会日期，因为他们已经认识到，这个会议不可能达到他们搜集最新式武器情报和自由进入社会主义国家领土的目的。同时，西方还想避免暴露他们不愿意就防止突然袭击的方法和手段达成协议的意图。西方采取这种态度，是因为他们害怕达成协议就会使国际紧张局势缓和，而国际紧张局势正是他们冷战政策的基础。
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫在今天下午在这里举行了记者招待会。他说，由于西方国家所采取的态度，防止突然袭击会议未能完成向有关政府报告防止这种突然袭击的实际措施这项主要任务。
    库兹?佐夫说：“突然袭击问题是冷战和军备竞赛政策的直接结果。冷战和军备竞赛政策在政府与政府之间播下了不信任和猜疑的种子，从而造成一国把另一国看作潜在敌人的局面。”
    库兹?佐夫列举了苏联和其他社会主义国家代表团就议程问题、禁止载有核武器的飞机在他国领空和公海上飞行、建立地面监督岗以及空中摄影制度等建议。这些建议表明了东方希望达成协议的诚挚愿望。他还揭露了西方借口会议属于技术性质而拒绝讨论这些问题的态度。
    库兹?佐夫指出，西方国家企图收集苏联和其他社会主义国家的国防和作战能力的材料，从而加紧军备竞赛；而社会主义国家则不希望进行军备竞赛，努力设法就防止突然袭击的具体措施达成协议。
    他说，社会主义国家将坚持不懈地努力，以便使防止突然袭击问题能够获得积极的解决。如果西方国家改变它们目前的消极态度，如果它们的代表也抱着社会主义国家代表那样的真挚愿望，那就可能在短期内找到具体措施来防止突然袭击的危险和减少发生另一次战争的危险。他最后说，这将是走向保障和平和创造有利条件来发展国际合作的重要步骤。（附图片）
