    Wugang People Make Full Use of Water Energy According to Local Conditions
    First Build Hydraulic Stations, Then Convert to Hydroelectric Stations
    (Our newspaper Changsha, December 15th dispatch) While carrying out water conservancy construction, Wugang County, Hunan Province, is vigorously developing water energy utilization, first building hydraulic stations.
    The Wugang County Party Committee organized more than fifty technical cadres, in coordination with experienced farmers, to conduct a general survey of the county's water resources. They discovered that in the sixty-five small rivers and streams running throughout the county, as well as in reservoirs and canals, there were more than 600 places with a drop of two meters or more. If hydroelectric stations were built in all these places, tens of thousands of kilowatts of electricity could be generated. Based on this, the County and Commune Party Committee decided to vigorously build hydroelectric stations in 1959. It was also decided that before equipment such as generators and motors could be resolved, hydraulic stations would be built first to fully utilize water energy. They divided their forces into two groups: on the one hand, they relied on the county's own hydropower machinery factory to rush to manufacture mechanical equipment for hydropower stations such as generators and motors; on the other hand, they relied on the masses to immediately build hydraulic stations to utilize water energy first. Once the self-made generators came off the production line, they would be installed in the hydraulic stations and converted into hydroelectric stations.
    Currently, a mass movement of the whole people vigorously developing water energy utilization has been launched vigorously. By December, 181 hydraulic stations had been built, all equipped with wooden water turbines, and equipped with 89 yellow grain rice milling machines, 45 sweet potato slicing machines, and 53 flour milling machines manufactured by the Wugang Machinery Factory and the machinery factories of various people's communes. 235 are under construction. Three have already generated electricity, and two are about to generate electricity.

    武冈人民因地制宜充分利用水能
    先建水力站  再变水电站
    本报长沙15日电  湖南省武冈县在兴修水利化的同时，大搞水能利用，先建水力站。
    武冈县委组织了五十多个技术干部，协同老农，对全县水力资源进行了普遍勘查，发现在纵横全县的六十五条小河和溪沟，以及水库渠道中，有六百多处落差在二公尺以上。如果在这些地方都建立水电站，就可发出几万瓩电量。县社党委据此确定在1959年大力兴建水电站。并确定在发电机、电动机等设备一时不能解决以前，先建水力站，充分利用水能。他们兵分两路，一方面依靠县里自己办的水电机械厂，赶制发电机和电动机等水电站的机械设备，一方面依靠群众立即建设水力站把水能先利用起来。等到自制的发电机一出厂，就安装到水力站，变为水电站。
    目前，一个群众性的全民大闹水能利用的运动已蓬勃开展，到12月，已建成水力站一百八十一处，全部安装了木制水轮机，并装上了武冈机械厂和各人民公社机械厂制造的黄谷碾米机八十九台、红薯切丝切片机四十五部、磨粉机五十三台。正在动工兴建的有二百三十五处。已发电的有三处，即将发电的有两处。
