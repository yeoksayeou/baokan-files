    Molten Steel Rushes Forth, Opening the Road Ahead
    Guangzhou to Become a South China Industrial Base

    (Our report) Since discarding the inferiority complex of "regional backwardness" and implementing the policy of "taking steel as the key link," Guangzhou's appearance has dramatically changed. Now, this city is no longer the commercial consumption city that people remember or imagine, or merely a city with some dilapidated mechanical repair industries and some light industries. It has the modern-scale Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, the Guangzhou No. 1 Heavy Machinery Plant that manufactures large-scale mechanical equipment, the modern Guangzhou Shipyard, and the Guangdong Tractor Factory that directly supports agricultural mechanization. The vigorous development of mass movements in the steel and machinery industries has greatly accelerated the pace of Guangzhou, which has the beginnings of a South China industrial base.

    Half a year ago, many people still held doubts about whether Guangzhou could quickly change its appearance, transform from a commercial consumption city to an industrial production city, and be built into an industrial base in South China. During the rectification campaign, the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee mobilized cadres and the masses to comprehensively analyze the current situation, focusing on the glorious revolutionary tradition of the working class in Guangzhou and the superior aspects of Guangzhou's industrial development conditions. It criticized the then-popular "Guangzhou backwardness theory" and the pessimistic argument that Guangzhou was a commercial city before liberation, had close ties with Hong Kong and Macau, was deeply influenced by capitalism, and was not easy to transform. This greatly liberated the minds of cadres and the masses and further boosted their enthusiasm. Since September, a vigorous nationwide steelmaking movement has been launched in the city. From the beginning of August to mid-November, a total of 73 converters and electric furnaces (160 units) have been built in the city, with an annual steel production capacity of over one million tons; 211 native-style blast furnaces for iron smelting have also been built, with an annual production capacity of over 200,000 tons. Since October, a high tide of nationwide indigenous steelmaking has surged, with more than 700,000 people in the city joining the battle of steelmaking, forming an unprecedented and largest-scale mass movement. Due to the resolute implementation of the policy of combining "small-scale indigenous groups" with "large-scale modern groups," in mid-November, Guangzhou's iron and steel industry, which was originally almost a blank sheet of paper, once achieved a record of producing 15,000 tons of steel per day. After steel production basically passed the test, the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee grasped steel on one hand and machinery on the other, so that the machinery marshal rose to power immediately afterwards. Like steelmaking and iron smelting, the manufacturing of mechanical equipment also proposed the slogan of combining indigenous and modern methods, but currently, it particularly emphasizes the priority of indigenous methods, that is, carrying out the "indigenous, simple, and mass" movement for machinery manufacturing. This movement was launched on the basis of nationwide steelmaking, and it used the successful experience of nationwide steelmaking in giving prominence to politics and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Therefore, it quickly set off a nationwide upsurge in running machinery, and the development of the "indigenous, simple, and mass" movement was unstoppable. It is estimated that from November 16 to December 10, within these 25 days, the city has manufactured 5,461 indigenous machine tools (mother machines) and 15,586 indigenous equipment, greatly exceeding the original plan to manufacture 5,000 indigenous simple machine tools by January next year.

    The new situation of taking steel as the key link to drive everything has not only promoted the early rise of the machinery marshal, but also enabled Guangzhou's industrial production and production and construction in all aspects to achieve a bumper harvest. The city's local industry completed 102.4% of its total industrial output value plan in the third quarter, an increase of 91.7% over the same period last year; among 51 major products, 11 have overfulfilled the city's plan. By the end of November, the city's total industrial output value had completed 93.6% of the annual leap forward plan; as long as we make another effort, the plan to increase the city's total industrial output value by 60% this year can be completed and strive to exceed it. Under the impetus of the steel high tide, automobile transportation, as a pioneer in the transportation sector, has also promoted train-like and multi-shift operations, and the volume of railway and waterway freight has increased rapidly month by month. The people of the city have almost all been tempered in the high tide of the mass steel production movement, and their ideological awareness has been universally improved.

    钢水奔流冲开前进道路
    广州将成华南工业基地
    本报讯  广州市自从打掉了“地区落后论”的自卑感、贯彻执行以钢为纲的方针以来，城市的面貌急剧改变。现在，这个城市已经不再是人们在记忆或想像中的商业消费城市，或者只是具有一些破破烂烂的机械修理工业和一些轻工业的城市。它拥有现代规模的广州钢铁厂，有制造大型机械设备的广州第一重型机器厂，有现代化的广州造船厂，有直接支援农业机械化的广东拖拉机厂；钢铁工业和机械工业的群众运动猛烈地开展以后，使具备了华南工业基地雏形的广州，大大加快向前迈进的速度。
    在半年以前，对于广州市能否迅速地改变面貌，变商业消费城市为工业生产城市，建设成为华南地区的一个工业基地？不少人仍然持有怀疑态度。在整风运动当中，广州市委发动干部和群众全面地分析了当前形势，着重指出了广州市工人阶级的光荣革命传统，以及广州市发展工业条件的优越方面，批判了当时相当流行的“广州落后论”，批判了一味认为广州在解放前是商业城市，与香港、澳门关系密切，资本主义影响深，改造不易的悲观论调，这就使干部和群众大大地解放了思想，进一步鼓起了干劲。9月以来，全市掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的全民炼钢铁运动。从8月初至11月中旬止，全市已建成了转炉、电炉共七十三套（一百六十个），每年产钢能力一百多万吨；又建成了炼铁土洋高炉二百一十一座，年产能力二十多万吨。从10月开始，全民土法炼钢高潮涌起，全市七十多万群众投入了炼钢铁的战斗，形成了史无前例的规模最大的群众运动。由于坚决贯彻了“小土群”和“大洋群”相结合的方针，在11月中旬，原来几乎是一张白纸的广州钢铁工业，就曾出现了日产一万五千吨钢的纪录。在钢铁生产基本过关后，广州市委一手抓钢铁，一手抓机械，使机械元帅接着升帐。同炼钢炼铁一样，制造机械设备也提出土洋并举的口号，而目前则特别着重土法先上马，即开展机械制造的“土简群”运动。这个运动在全民炼钢的基础上开展起来，并且运用了全民炼钢中政治挂帅、大搞群众运动的成功经验，因而很快地掀起了全民办机械的热潮，“土简群”运动的发展势如破竹。计从11月16日至12月10日这二十五天内，全市已制成土机床（工作母机）五千四百六十一台，土设备一万五千五百八十六台，大大超过了原来确定的到明年1月要制造土简机床五千台的计划。
    以钢为纲带动一切的新形势，既促进机械元帅及早升帐，同时使广州市的工业生产和各方面的生产建设工作均获丰收。全市地方工业第三季度工业总产值计划完成了102.4％，较去年同期增长了91.7％；在五十一种主要产品中，已有十一种超额完成了全市计划。到11月底止，全市工业总产值已完成了全年跃进计划的93.6％；只要再努一把力，今年全市工业总产值比去年增加60％的计划将可以完成并争取超过。在钢铁高潮的推动下，作为先行官的交通运输部门的汽车运输，也推广了列车化和多班化，铁路和水路货运量都逐月飞速增长。全市人民几乎都在钢铁生产群众运动高潮中受到了锻炼，思想觉悟普遍提高。
