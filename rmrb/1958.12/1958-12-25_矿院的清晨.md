The Morning at the Mining Institute
Chen Zhonghuang

Early morning, the playground of the Beijing Mining Institute is packed with people. “For the Motherland, Exercise! Exercise! Exercise!” The direct-affiliated company composed of the institute's representative team shouts out a resounding slogan, and immediately, the surroundings respond with a challenging reply: “Exercise to build the body, defend the Motherland!”. Thus, Beijing Mining Institute begins another fighting morning.

The institute's marathon team begins practicing, the “Flying General Bicycle” team begins practicing, and the various sports teams formed by the students, all aiming to reach the cutting edge, also begin practicing. On the track, the militia marches in neat steps; in the weightlifting field, the "strongmen" are playing with barbells. When you think of stretching on the wall bars or doing activities on the horizontal bar and rings, you have to wait a bit, because these places are already "crowded". When you see a group of girls clumsily doing calisthenics, don't laugh, maybe by this time next year, they will have realized their long-cherished wish—to obtain the title of Master of Sports.

If you pay a little attention, you will see Comrade Wei Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, and leading Party and League cadres from various departments active among the exercising crowd. They sometimes practice running, and sometimes go to the equipment to “cheer on” the hard-working militia. It is precisely because of their concern and leadership that the sports activities at the Mining Institute appear even more active.

In the long-distance running ranks, you will definitely find a sturdy young man, Tu Runde from the Electromechanical 56-4 class. Exercise is something he really cannot do without, because exercise has enabled him to break away from the "sick person" "title" in October this year. He had previously prepared to drop out of school due to illness, but now he is a level-two athlete and a main member of the electromechanical department's long-distance running team. For another young man, Huang Rulun, practicing long-distance running has another meaning. After eight hours of heavy labor in a cement factory every day, he still insists on running 20,000 to 30,000 meters; this practice not only did not "exhaust" him, but on the contrary, strengthened his physique, making his labor particularly easy.

Among the crowd on the playground, if you randomly ask an athlete covered in sweat, or ask a "local coach" who is explaining the essentials of the movements to people lined up in neat rows, they will all tell you what great changes participation in exercise has brought them. Li Honghui from Road 57-2, who was called a "youthful old man," has also set his own "Master of Sports plan." In the past, it was difficult to pass even the first level of the Labor and Defense System, but now he is a level-two athlete. In addition, the female students of Machine 58-2 class say when they talk about physical exercise: "If you don't exercise for a day, your body feels tight and your mind feels heavy."

The sun has not yet come out, but the morning exercise time passes quickly. After the bugle sounds, each exercise captain gathers the reluctant militia fighters at each designated location, preparing to rush towards new combat missions.

The prevalence and consciousness of exercise here is not without reason. This is mainly due to the Party Committee personally taking charge and the students clarifying their exercise goals, because everyone understands: If you want to be a red miner and strive for the coal mining industry for fifty years, you cannot achieve it without a strong physique.

    矿院的清晨  
    陈中煌
    清晨，北京矿业学院的操场上人满满的。“为祖国，锻炼！锻炼！锻炼！”院代表队组成的直属连喊出响亮的口号，立刻，四周报以带有挑战意味的回答：“锻炼身体，保卫祖国！”。这样，北京矿业学院开始了又一个战斗的早晨。
    院马拉松运动队开始练习了，“健将自行车”运动队开始练习了，同学们组成的各种各样向尖端进军的运动队也开始练习了。在跑道上，民兵队伍迈着整齐的步伐在跑步；在举重场，“大力士”们在拨弄着杠铃。当你想到肋木上拉拉韧带或者到单杠、吊环上活动的时候，那你还得等一下，因为哪里已“挤”满了人。当你看到一群姑娘在不熟练地做着柔软体操，你不要笑，也许明年这个时候，她们已实现了自己的宿愿——获得运动健将称号。
    如果你稍微留神，就会看到党委副书记魏明同志和各系党团领导干部活跃在锻炼的人群中，他们时而练习着跑步，时而走到器械旁给苦练的民兵们“加油”。正是由于他们的关心和带头，矿院的体育活动才显得更加活跃。
    在长跑的行列里，你一定会找到一个结实的小伙子，他是机电56—4班的涂润德。锻炼对他来说，真是怎么也不能缺少的，因为锻炼已使他在今年10月脱离“病号”的“称号”。以前他曾因病而准备退学，而现在他已经是二级运动员，成为机电系长跑队的一员主力。练长跑对另一位小伙子黄如轮来说，又有另一番意义，他每天在水泥厂进行繁重的八小时劳动后，还坚持跑两万到三万公尺；这样练不但没有使他“累垮”，相反地使他因体质增强了，劳动起来特别轻松。
    在操场的人群中，你随便问一个满身汗水的运动员，或者问一个给排着整齐队伍的人们讲解着动作要领的“土教练”，他们都会告诉你参加锻炼后给他们带来什么样大的变化。被人称为“青年老头化”的路57—2李鸿惠也订下了自己的“健将计划”，过去连劳卫制一级都难通过，现在已经是二级运动员了。另外机58—2班的女同学们一谈到体育锻练就说：“一天不锻炼，身子就发紧，脑子就发沉”。
    太阳还没有出来，但早晨锻炼的时间很快就过去了。军号响过后，各个锻炼队长便在各个指定地点召集着依依不舍的民兵战士，准备奔向新的战斗任务。
    锻炼风气在这里这样普遍和自觉，不是没有原因的，这主要是党委亲自挂帅和同学们明确了自己的锻炼目的，因为大家明白：想当个红色的矿工和为煤矿事业奋斗五十年，没有健壮的体格是达不到的。（附图片）
