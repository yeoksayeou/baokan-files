Participate in Production to Lead Production

    The experience of the Shuanggang Commune Steel Plant in implementing "Three Members, Four Same, Five Do" is a concrete manifestation of our Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses.
    The "Three Members" means that the enterprise's management workers are both commanders, combatants, and technicians. The "Four Same" means that enterprise leaders, in their relationship with the masses, should eat, live, work, and consult with them together. The "Five Do" means that when the enterprise leaders lead the work, they should do it creatively, boldly, diligently, practically, and take the lead.
    Cadres directly participating in production labor can go deep into the production process, specifically lead production, go deep among the masses, and lead the masses, so that leaders and the masses can be seamlessly integrated and become one in common labor. This approach is conducive to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and also conducive to promoting the democratization of factory management and further improving production.
    After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the work style of the broad masses of cadres has undergone significant changes, and participation in production labor has become very common. In the production process, they directly understand the production situation and the ideological situation of the masses, solve new problems in production in a timely manner, and grasp the laws of production to achieve victory in the struggle for production. However, there are still some cadres who, to this day, lack sufficient understanding of the importance of participating in production and leading production. They oppose labor production to overall leadership, believing that directly participating in production labor cannot achieve overall leadership; some believe that participating in labor always takes time, and spending time on labor will reduce leadership time. In the eyes of these comrades, the work of leaders is leadership, while labor is something outside of leadership work. Therefore, they only see the contradictory aspect of leadership and participation in production, but not the unified aspect. Therefore, they cannot correctly understand the relationship between participating in production and leading production.
    We believe that the main task of enterprise leaders is to do a good job in production management. Large enterprises must have full-time factory directors to be in charge of all factory production affairs. If a factory director is required to spend all his time doing labor production like ordinary workers, it will inevitably weaken leadership work and lead to a state of no one being responsible. However, it is also impossible to imagine that someone who does not understand production and is divorced from the masses can manage the factory well. To truly gain the leadership of production, one must first participate in production and learn production. Therefore, the participation of leaders in production is not an extra burden, but is for the purpose of leading production better.
    The "Three Members, Four Same, Five Do" approach proposed by the Shuanggang Commune in Zhejiang should be promoted. This is not only an important key to fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and ensuring a further leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, but also a fundamental path for cultivating leadership workers with practical and all-round abilities, thoroughly overcoming the three styles and five airs, and achieving both redness and expertise.

### 参加生产领导生产

    参加生产领导生产
    双港公社钢铁厂实行“三员、四同、五干”的经验，是我们党密切联系群众的优良传统的具体表现。
    所谓“三员”，就是企业的管理工作者既是指挥员、又是战斗员和技术员。所谓“四同”，就是企业领导人员在群众的关系上做到同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。所谓“五干”，就是企业的领导者在领导干活的时候，做到创造性地干、大胆地干、苦干、实干、带头干。
    干部直接参加生产劳动，可以深入生产过程，具体领导生产；深入群众，领导群众，使领导者和群众在共同劳动中融洽无间、打成一片。这种作法，有利于充分地调动群众的积极性和创造性，也有利于推动工厂管理民主化，进一步搞好生产。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，广大干部的工作作风有了显著的转变，参加生产劳动的已很普遍。他们在生产过程中，直接了解生产情况和群众思想情况，及时解决生产中的新问题，并且掌握生产规律，取得生产斗争的胜利。但是也还有些干部直到现在对于参加生产，领导生产的重要性还缺乏足够的认识。他们把劳动生产与全面领导对立起来，认为直接参加生产劳动就不能实现全面领导；有的认为参加劳动总是花费时间的，劳动花去了时间，就得减少领导时间。在这些同志看来，领导人员的工作就是领导，而劳动则是领导工作以外的事。因而他们只看到领导与参加生产矛盾的一面，却看不到统一的一面。因而也就不能够正确地理解参加生产与领导生产的关系。
    我们认为企业领导人员的工作主要是做好生产管理。大的企业必需设有专职的厂长，专管全厂生产事务，如果要求一个厂长全部时间同普通工人一样劳动生产，就必然削弱领导工作，就会变成无人负责状态。但是，也不能设想一个不懂生产脱离群众的人就能管好工厂。要真正取得生产领导权，必须首先参加生产、学会生产，所以，领导人员参加生产不是什么额外负担，而是为了更好地领导生产。
    浙江双港公社提出的“三员、四同、五干”的作法应该发扬，这不仅是充分调动群众积极性创造性、保证工农业生产进一步大跃进的重要关键，同时，也是培养领导工作者具有踏实的全能的本领，彻底克服三风五气做到又红又专的根本道路。
