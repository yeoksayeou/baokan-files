    Hegang and Other Coal Mines Produce Large Quantities of High-Quality Coking Coal
    Helping Eight Steel Bases Produce More Steel
    (Our Newspaper News) The Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Jixi coal mines in Heilongjiang Province have fully tapped their potential, renovated and built new mine shafts, and produced large quantities of high-quality coking coal, supporting seven provinces and eight steel bases and strongly supporting the "ascent to command" of the steel marshal.
    Heilongjiang Province is one of China's famous coal industrial bases. In recent years, a large number of old mine shafts have been renovated, and many modern mine shafts and mining factories have been newly built. From January to October this year alone, 227 new mine shafts were built, of which 158 were built with self-raised funds, an increase of 650% over the original plan. This year, the Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Jixi coal mines have actively implemented the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects and combining indigenous and foreign methods, criticized erroneous ideas such as "increased production must require increased manpower and equipment" and "production has reached its peak," fully mobilized and relied on the masses, tapped the production capacity of existing coal mines, and built a number of new shafts with self-raised funds, increasing the output of coking coal by three to four times compared with last year, which can produce 10 million tons of pig iron. This year, the Hegang Coal Mine started construction of 94 new mine shafts without any state investment, more than five times the original plan. By the end of November, the new mine shafts had already produced more than 400,000 tons of coal.
    The three major coal mines launched a mass technical revolution movement, created and promoted advanced experiences, and reformed coal mining methods. At present, six coal mining areas in the three major coal mines have implemented hydraulic coal mining, with the better ones producing more than 1,000 tons per day. By the end of November, the Hegang Coal Mine had created more than 500 kinds of small machinery, increasing efficiency by one to twenty times. More than 80 pieces of various machinery in the Hegang Coal Mine have been remotely controlled; many mine shafts in the Jixi and Shuangyashan mines have also implemented a series of mechanical automation from underground to above ground, greatly improving production efficiency. The Hegang Dongshan Mine has now reached 2.65 tons per man-day, creating the highest record in the country, two times higher than last year.
    In order to overcome the shortage of labor caused by the great leap in production, various coal mines have also mobilized family members of miners to participate in production. In the Jixi and Hegang mining areas alone, 6,000 women have participated in various production labor above and below ground. Many cadres and residents near the coal mines went to open-pit mines to carry soil and coal in their spare time, doing voluntary labor.
    This year, coal mine prospecting personnel in Heilongjiang Province have actively explored and identified three new coalfields, which were officially developed in July. These three new coking coal areas are located in Jixian, Boli, and Baoqing counties, with reserves of 2 billion tons. These mines will be put into production next year, and a large amount of high-quality coking coal will be supplied to various places.

### 鹤岗等煤矿生产大量优质炼焦煤  帮助八个钢铁基地多出钢铁

    鹤岗等煤矿生产大量优质炼焦煤
    帮助八个钢铁基地多出钢铁
    本报讯  黑龙江省鹤岗、双鸭、鸡西三大煤矿充分挖掘潜力，改建、新建矿井，生产大量优质炼焦煤，支援了七个省八个钢铁基地，有力地支持了钢铁元帅升帐。
    黑龙江省是我国著名的煤炭工业基地之一。几年来改建了大量的旧矿井，新建了许多近代化的矿井和矿山工厂，仅今年1至10月，新建矿井二百二十七对，其中自筹资金建的矿井达一百五十八处，建井数比原计划增加650％。今年，鹤岗、双鸭、鸡西煤矿积极贯彻执行了大中小并举，土、洋结合的方针，批判了“增产必须增人、增设备”、“增产到顶”等错误思想，充分发动和依靠群众，挖掘现有煤矿的产量，自筹资金建设一批新井，使炼焦煤的产量比去年增加三至四倍，可炼生铁一千万吨。鹤岗煤矿今年没用国家一分投资开工兴建了新矿井九十四对，比原计划增加五倍以上，到11月底仅新矿井已出煤四十多万吨。
    三大煤矿开展了群众性的技术革命运动，创造和推广先进经验，改革了采煤方法。目前三大煤矿已有六个采煤区推行了水力采煤，其中较好的日产量超过千吨。鹤岗煤矿到11月末已创造小型机械五百多种，效率提高一倍到二十倍。鹤岗煤矿有八十多台各种机械实行了远距离操纵；鸡西、双鸭两矿许多矿井也都实行了从井下到井上一系列的机械自动化，大大提高了生产效率。鹤岗东山矿目前已达到每工日产二点六五吨，创造了全国最高纪录，比去年提高两倍。
    为了克服生产大跃进所出现的劳动力不足的现象，各个煤矿还发动矿工家属参加了生产，仅鸡西、鹤岗两个矿区就有六千名妇女参加了井上、井下各种生产劳动。不少煤矿附近的机关干部和居民，在业余时间到露天矿上挑土挑煤，进行义务劳动。
    黑龙江省今年煤矿勘探人员又积极探明三处新煤田，7月份已正式开拓。这三个新炼焦煤区是在集贤、勃利和宝清三县，埋藏量达二十亿吨。明年这些矿井就能投入生产，大量优质炼焦煤即可源源供应各地。
