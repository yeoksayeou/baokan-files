    Using Traditional Techniques to Portray Modern Characters
    – From “Liang Qiuyan” to the Performance of Modern Drama
    Mei Lanfang
    The Shaanxi Provincial Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing brought us a good modern drama: "Liang Qiuyan." Although "Liang Qiuyan" depicts the struggle between old and new ideas on marriage issues in the past countryside, it has been welcomed by audiences for several years. I heard in Xi'an that this was a good play. Seeing it in Beijing this time, it is indeed well-deserved. Liang Qiuyan's struggle against her father's arranged marriage, although sharing some commonalities with similar themed operas, is nonetheless very captivating! The Mei Hu dialect is inherently pleasing to the ear, and coupled with the actors' skilled and natural performances, it feels both enjoyable to watch and listen to.
    Li Ruifang, who plays Liang Qiuyan, and Ren Yonghua, who plays Liu Chunsheng, in the first scene, "Mutual Affection," very realistically portray the simple and pure friendship between this loving rural couple. This touching depiction of pure love powerfully highlights the irrationality of feudal arranged marriages, demonstrating the righteousness of Liang Qiuyan's fight for freedom of marriage. Li Ruifang's singing is not only beautiful but also gives a feeling of health and fullness. Wu Dejin, who plays Liang the Elder, very profoundly portrays this conservative and stubborn old farmer with feudal ideas. In many places, he naturally reveals Liang the Elder's stubbornness and inner contradictions through his singing. His gradual transformation is also very realistic and reasonable. The depiction of Liang the Elder in the play has a benevolent satire, while the depiction of Hou Xiashan is a revelation and criticism, without uglifying him superficially. He vividly paints the face of this loafer in the countryside, especially his singing and performance, which maintain the characteristics of a clown role without exaggerating the form. His creation provides a clue for playing negative characters in modern dramas. Wang Yuxian, who plays Zhang Julian, also highlights the character of a young widow through a few actions from her entrance. She loves Liang Xiaocheng but avoids him, and the pressure of feudal forces on her, her background, and inner contradictions can be clearly seen from this.
    "Liang Qiuyan" is a good modern drama in Shaanxi opera, and undoubtedly it will live on the stage for a long time and become a repertoire piece. "Liang Qiuyan" has been continuously revised and refined, and many of our excellent traditional plays have reached their current level only after years of continuous polishing. We must enrich and refine modern dramas in terms of script, performance, singing, and stage art to continuously improve them and become "traditional" repertoire of modern drama. "Liang Qiuyan" has gained its footing in this way. We must not let modern dramas be performed once and then discarded, but must preserve them through continuous accumulation. Because "Liang Qiuyan" has been performed for several years, the actors have become very skilled in their performances. At the same time, it can be seen that these characters on stage are very familiar to us. We seem to have seen them somewhere, which shows that the playwrights' and actors' performances are based on solid life experiences.
    We must create modern dramas worthy of today's great heroic era, and shape the heroic images of our contemporaries on the stage, so that the modern Luo Shengjiao, Huang Jiguan, Zhang Qiuxiang, ... and the ancient Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, Mu Guiying, Wen Tianxiang ... can be juxtaposed on the stage, forever encouraging us.
    Recently, I have watched some modern dramas, and I have some immature ideas. I think that creating modern characters must also inherit tradition. In my opinion, inheriting tradition should not be narrowly limited to using traditional singing techniques. Moreover, we must deeply understand the scriptwriting methods and descriptive techniques of traditional opera, all the way to performance, singing, routines, and so on. We must use the unique expressive techniques of Chinese opera to create modern characters. On the one hand, we must absorb those things that can be used from the original traditional techniques, develop and change them, and use them on the characters in modern dramas. On the other hand, we can extract and process from real life, and create new singing styles, new formats, and new methods suitable for modern characters according to the expressive principles of traditional techniques. For example, in order to shape the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage, can't we extract and design a set of routines based on the action of holding a gun in life? Can't we extract and design a set of routines based on the action of steelmaking in life? If we have these new routines, then can't the actors playing the People's Liberation Army and steelworkers design many new movements based on the character's personality, environment, and plot within this set of routines? Looking back, we see that the characters in some modern dramas do not leave a deep impression and the image is not distinct. In addition to the reasons for the script description, I am afraid that the actors have not used traditional techniques well or created new movements in these plays is a factor. The reason why Liang the Elder, Hou Xiashan, Zhang Julian, Liang Qiuyan ... in "Liang Qiuyan" are unforgettable is that they have new movements of creation. For example, Liang the Elder often turns his head to express his dissatisfaction or frustration, which can explain his stubbornness; another example is Hou Xiashan's singing, combined with his kind of wretched gestures, truly expresses the cunning mood of this loafer; Zhang Julian, from the body movements of walking after her appearance, shows her love for Liang Xiaocheng but also avoids him, which is very in line with the identity of this young widow. Henan Opera "Chaoyang Ditch", "Liu Hulan", Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Sanliwan", Beijing Opera "White Clouds and Red Flag" ..., have all made the same creation, leaving a deep impression and gaining success. In life, everyone often has his own "habitual movements," why can't we design his "habitual movements" or even body movements on the dramatic characters (he was originally extracted, exaggerated, generalized, and concentrated by the playwright)!
    Using original traditional techniques to portray modern characters is also extremely important. For example, in the Beijing opera "The White Haired Girl," when Yang Bailao was kicked down by Huang Shiren, the actor used a tumbling movement, which can very well express the character's situation at the time; another example is the Henan opera "Yuan Tiancheng's Revolution," when Neng Gou is called back loudly by Yuan Tiancheng, she walks to the stage door, and a "hawk turns over" returns to Yuan Tiancheng, this movement can very well explain Neng Gou's unexpected surprise. These applications of traditional techniques are very helpful to the portrayal of characters. In this regard, the opera world has already achieved some achievements. However, if traditional techniques are moved for the sake of moving them, regardless of the character's personality and environment, it will embark on the formalistic path of using them for the sake of using them, mechanically piecing them together, which is worth noting. Regarding inheriting the tradition and creating modern characters, of course, in addition to performing arts, opera music has a very close relationship with body movements. In the past, the fashion dramas I directed never solved the music problem well. Now, in the performance of modern dramas, there have been some creations in the music problem, but it still needs us to further develop and create to adapt to the new requirements of reflecting modern life. In a sense, it is more complicated than performing arts. Other issues such as clothing design and stage art also need further exploration, which will not be elaborated here.

    运用传统技巧刻划现代人物
    ——从“梁秋燕”谈到现代戏的表演
    梅兰芳
    陕西省戏曲赴京演出团给我们带来一出好的现代戏：“梁秋燕”。“梁秋燕”虽是描写过去农村中婚姻问题的新旧思想斗争的作品，但是几年来一直受到观众的欢迎。我在西安就听说这是出好戏。这次在北京看到它，确是名不虚传。梁秋燕反对父亲包办婚姻的斗争，虽和同类型题材的戏曲，有些共同点。但是，这出戏却迷人得很！郿鄠唱腔本来就很动听，再加上演员们纯熟自如的表演，就感到既耐看又受听了。
    李瑞芳演梁秋燕，任永华演刘春生，他们在第一场“情投意合”中，就非常真实地表现出这一对彼此相爱的农村青年那种朴素纯真的情谊，这种纯朴爱情的动人描写，有力地反衬出封建包办婚姻的不合理，说明梁秋燕争取婚姻自由的正义性。李瑞芳的唱腔不仅很美，而且给人一种健康饱满的感觉。吴德锦演的梁老大，非常深刻地把这个保守固执、有着封建思想的老农塑造了出来，他在许多地方都很自然地从演唱中揭示出梁老大的固执和内心矛盾。他的逐渐转变，也都很真实而且合情合理。剧中对梁老大的描写具有善意的讽刺，而对侯下山的描写，则是一种揭露和批判，没有从皮象上去丑化他，活生生地画出这个农村中的二流子的面貌，特别是他的唱腔和表演，既保持了丑角的特点，而且没有从形式上去夸张，他每句唱的收尾都有恰到好处的夸张性的装饰音，他的这种创造，为演现代戏的反面人物提供了一个线索。王玉娴扮演的张菊莲，也是从出场时几个动作里把一个青年寡妇的性格突现了出来，她爱着梁小成却又躲躲闪闪，封建势力对她的压力，她的身世、内心矛盾，从这里就可以看得很清楚了。
    “梁秋燕”是陕西戏曲中现代戏的一出好戏，无疑它将长时期地活在舞台上，成为保留剧目。“梁秋燕”是经过不断修改加工的，我们许多优秀传统剧目也正是经过多少年来的不断锤炼才达到今天的水平。我们对待现代戏一定要从剧本、表演、唱腔、舞台美术等方面，丰富再丰富，加工再加工，才能不断提高，成为现代戏的“传统”剧目，“梁秋燕”就是这样站住脚了的。我们决不能使现代戏演一个丢一个，一定要使它在不断积累中保留下来。“梁秋燕”由于演了几年，演员演来已经驾轻就熟了。同时，可以看出，舞台上的这些人物对我们来讲，非常熟悉，我们似乎在什么地方见过他们，这就说明剧作者和演员们的表演，都是有着坚实的生活依据的。
    我们必须创造出无愧于今天伟大的英雄时代的现代戏，在舞台上塑造出我们同时代的英雄形象，使现代的罗盛教、黄继光、张秋香、……和古代的赵云、黄忠、穆桂英、文天祥……并列在舞台上，永远鼓励我们。
    最近，我看了一些现代戏，我有这样一些不太成熟的想法。我觉得，创造现代人物形象，也必须继承传统。继承传统，我认为不要狭隘地仅仅想到只是运用传统的演唱技巧，而且，还要深刻地理会传统戏曲的戏本创作方法、描写技巧，直到表演、唱腔、程式等等，要运用中国戏曲独特的表现手法来创造现代的人物。我们一方面要从原有的传统技巧中，吸取那些可以运用的东西，加以发展和变化，用在现代戏里的人物身上。另一方面，我们可以从现实生活中提炼、加工，根据传统技巧的表现原则来创造适合于现代人物的新唱腔、新格式、新手段，例如为了在舞台上塑造工农兵的英雄形象，我们难道不可以根据生活中拿枪的动作，来提炼设计一套程式吗？我们难道不可以根据生活中炼钢的动作，来提炼设计一套程式吗？如果说，我们有了这些新程式，那么扮演解放军、炼钢工人的演员，不是可以在这套程式中，根据人物性格、环境、情节，来设计许多新身段吗？回过头来，我们看一看有些现代戏里的人物，给人的印象不深，形象不鲜明，除了剧本描写的原因外，恐怕演员在这些戏中，没有很好地运用传统技巧或是创造出新的身段是一个因素。“梁秋燕”里的梁老大、侯下山、张菊莲、梁秋燕……之所以令人印象难忘，他们身上是有新的身段动作的创造的。例如梁老大，他常常头一扭地表示自己的不满或是懊丧，很能说明他的固执；又如侯下山的唱腔，结合他那种猥琐的手势，把这个二流子的狡猾心境，真切地表现了出来；张菊莲则是从出场后行路的身段中，表现了她爱梁小成而又有所闪避的心情，很切合这个青年寡妇的身份。豫剧“朝阳沟”、“刘胡兰”，湖南花鼓戏“三里湾”，京戏“白云红旗”……，都有过同样的创造，给人印象深刻，获得了成功。在生活里，每个人往往有他自己的“习惯动作”，为什么我们不能在戏剧人物身上（他本来就是经过剧作者的提炼、夸张、概括、集中了的），也设计一下他的“习惯动作”以至于身段呢！
    运用原有的传统技巧，来刻划现代人物也极重要。例如京戏“白毛女”，杨白劳被黄世仁一脚踢倒时，演员用了抢背的身段，很能表现人物当时的情景；又如豫剧“袁天成革命”，能不够被袁天成大声叫回来时，她走到下场门那里，一个“鹞子翻身”就回到袁天成面前，这个身段很能说明能不够出乎意外的惊诧神情。这些对传统技巧的运用，都很有助于人物形象的刻划。在这方面，目前戏曲界已经取得了一些成就。但若是为了搬用传统技巧，而不顾人物性格、环境，就会走上为运用而运用、生搬硬凑的形式主义道路，这是很值得留意的。关于继承传统创造现代人物，当然，除了表演艺术之外，戏曲音乐对身段动作有极其密切联系，过去我所排演的时装戏，音乐问题是始终没有很好解决的。现在，现代戏的演出，音乐问题有了某些创造，但是，它仍然有待于我们进一步发展创造，以适应新的反映现代生活的要求。从某种意义上说来，它比之表演艺术更为复杂。其他如服装设计、舞台美术等方面的问题，也还有待进一步的探讨，此处都不阐述了。
