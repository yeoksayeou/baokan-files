Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 18th: The thin sheet metal rolling workshop of the Lenin Factory in Nowa Huta, one of Poland's largest construction projects in recent years, was handed over for production today. The iron sheets produced by this workshop can be as thin as 0.24 millimeters.

Present at the opening ceremony of the new project were Polish party and government leaders Gomulka, Cyrankiewicz, and Loga-Sowinski, as well as the Soviet Communist Party delegation headed by Mikoyan, and the delegations of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the German Socialist Unity Party, and the German Communist Party.

Polish Minister of Heavy Industry Żymajtis, Mikoyan, and Gomulka spoke at the ceremony. Mikoyan congratulated the Polish workers on their victory. He then said that the Soviet Union is on the eve of a new stage of economic development. The realization of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will not only further enhance the power of the Soviet Union, but also further enhance the power of all socialist countries. Socialism is winning victory step by step throughout the world, and gaining more and more sympathy among the working people. Even our most die-hard enemies have to admit this. He went on to say that during the seven-year plan, the Soviet Union will complete decisive work in establishing the material and technical foundations of communism.

In his speech, Gomulka thanked the builders of Nowa Huta and the Soviet engineers on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. He said that we must realize our tasks in the condition of realizing solidarity with the entire socialist camp.

He then said that the governments of socialist countries yearn for peace. However, it should be remembered that there are many threats to the security and peace of our camp. In a sense, the Soviet Union is also building complete defense forces for all of us. He pointed out that Poland's strength lies in the unity of the socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: According to TASS, Warsaw: The Soviet Communist Party delegation headed by Mikoyan, which came to Poland to attend the 40th anniversary celebration of the Polish Communist Party, as well as the delegations of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the German Socialist Unity Party, and the German Communist Party, visited the Nowotko factory in Warsaw on the 17th.

"There is a solid friendly relationship between the people and the parties of our two countries, and we must do everything possible to make this friendship between the people and the parties of our two countries more consolidated and developed."

    社会主义一步步在全世界赢得胜利
    新华社华沙18日电  波兰近年来最大建设项目之一——诺瓦胡塔列宁工厂的薄铁板压延车间今天移交生产，这个车间所生产的铁板厚度可达零点二四毫米。
    前来参加新项目开工典礼的有波兰党政领导人哥穆尔卡、西伦凯维兹、洛加—索文斯基，以米高扬为首的苏联共产党代表团，以及捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团、德国统一社会党代表团和德国共产党代表团。
    波兰重工业部部长热马伊蒂斯、米高扬和哥穆尔卡先后在典礼上讲了话。米高扬祝贺波兰工人们的胜利。他接着说，苏联正处在经济发展新阶段的前夕。苏联发展国民经济七年计划的实现将不仅进一步增强苏联的威力，而且会进一步增强所有社会主义国家的威力。社会主义正一步一步地在全世界赢得胜利，在劳动人民中获得越来越大的同情。这一点连我们最死硬的敌人也不得不承认。他接着说，苏联在七年计划期间将为建立共产主义物质技术基础完成有决定性意义的工作。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会向诺瓦胡塔建设者和苏联工程师致谢。他说，我们要在实现同整个社会主义阵营的团结条件下来实现我们的任务。
    他接着说，社会主义各国政府渴望和平。但是，应当记住，对我们阵营的安全和和平存在着许多威胁。在某种意义上说，苏联也正是为我们大家建设着完备的防御力量。他指出，波兰的力量在于社会主义阵营的团结。
