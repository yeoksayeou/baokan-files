Indigenous Iron Breaks Through High-Sulfur Encirclement
First Ministry of Machine Building Promotes "Indigenous" Nodular Cast Iron to Replace Steel in Manufacturing Castings

(Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries recently jointly convened an experience exchange meeting on indigenous iron casting, deciding to vigorously promote "indigenous" nodular cast iron throughout the national machinery industry to replace steel in manufacturing mechanical castings.

"Indigenous" nodular cast iron is the result of successful experiments conducted by the Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building in conjunction with the Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Factory, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Tsinghua University, and other units during the course of production. Tests have proven that after machine parts are cast from high-sulfur indigenous iron, and then subjected to six to ten hours of annealing, the sulfur in the cast iron promotes the spheroidization of the contained graphite, transforming it into indigenous nodular cast iron. Its tensile strength, toughness, hardness variation, and stamping resistance are all close to those of foreign nodular cast iron and exceed those of ordinary cast iron. Dozens of machine parts cast using indigenous nodular cast iron, ranging in size from 600 kilograms for the front wheel hubs, vertical shafts, horizontal shafts of universal chassis tractors, boiler axles, cylinder liners, gearboxes, gears, and crusher bodies, to only 20 grams, have undergone trial runs and evaluations, demonstrating good mechanical properties and meeting design standards.

During the mass steelmaking movement, a large amount of indigenous iron was produced throughout China. Indigenous iron has a high sulfur content, and in the past, it was generally believed that high-sulfur pig iron was brittle and easily broken, making it unsuitable for processing, even for ordinary cast iron, let alone for higher-grade nodular cast iron. However, the results of this scientific experiment have turned the disadvantage of high sulfur content in iron into an advantage, using sulfur instead of magnesium to promote graphite spheroidization during annealing. This unique creation in the machinery industry not only opens up broad avenues for indigenous iron to become useful but also saves the country a large amount of magnesium. The process of treating "indigenous" nodular cast iron is convenient to operate, requires simple equipment, and can be implemented by small and medium-sized cities and people's communes, utilizing local machinery industries to locally use indigenous iron to cast "indigenous" nodular cast iron machine parts.

The representatives from various provinces and cities who attended the meeting, after four days of discussions and on-site visits, all agreed that the new creation of "indigenous" nodular cast iron has increased the value of indigenous iron a hundredfold. Everyone formulated plans, determined to go back and vigorously promote it. Duan Junyi, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, pointed out at the meeting that the successful trial of "indigenous" nodular cast iron replacing steel is another victory on the economic front. He asked the representatives of various provinces and cities to first conduct key experiments, summarize experience, and convene local on-site meetings after everyone is convinced, and then vigorously promote it, so that "indigenous" nodular cast iron will blossom everywhere and rapidly develop local machinery industries.

The representatives from various regions also widely exchanged simple and easy-to-implement experiences in hot blast stoves, alkaline furnaces, neutral furnace linings, as well as desulfurization outside the furnace and desulfurization inside the furnace, minimizing the sulfur content in indigenous iron during the melting and tapping process, thereby casting gray iron castings and solving the problem of using indigenous iron to cast ordinary machine castings.

    土铁冲出高硫包围
    一机部推广“土”球墨铸铁代替钢材造铸件
    本报讯  第一机械工业部和北京市机电局在最近共同召开的土铁铸造经验交流会上决定：在全国机械工业中大力推广“土”球墨铸铁，以代替钢材铸机械铸件。
    “土”球墨铸铁是第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院同北京第一通用机械厂、北京农业机械厂和清华大学等单位在结合生产的过程中试验成功的。试验证明：用含硫高的土铁铸成机件以后，再经过六到十小时的退火，使铸铁中的硫促进所含的石墨球化，变成土球墨铸铁，其抗拉强度、韧性、硬变，耐冲压性能都接近洋球墨铸铁，超过一般铸铁。用土球墨铸铁铸造的万能底盘拖拉机的前轮轮盘、立轴、横轴、锅驼机的轴、汽缸套、变速箱、齿轮和破碎机机身等大至六百公斤，小的只有二十克的几十种机件，经过试车鉴定，机械性能良好，质量达到设计标准。
    在全民炼钢运动中，我国各地都生产了大量的土铁，土铁含硫量很高，过去人们一向认为：含硫高的生铁质脆易断，不能加工，连做普通铸铁的资格都没有，做更高一级的球墨铸铁就更不可能了。这次科学试验的结果，却把铁里面含硫高的坏事变成了好事，退火时利用硫代替镁促进石墨球化。这种机械工业中的独特创造，不仅为土铁成器开辟了广阔的道路，而且可以为国家节省大量的镁。处理“土”球墨铸铁时操作方便，设备简单，中小城市和人民公社都可以利用当地的机械工业就地利用土铁，铸“土”球墨铸铁的机件。
    出席这次会议的各省市代表经过了四天讨论和现场参观，都认为“土”球墨铸铁的新创造，使土铁的身价高了百倍。大家都订出规划，决心回去大力推广。第一机械工业部副部长段君毅在会上指出：“土”球墨铸铁代替钢材的试验成功，是经济战线上的又一次胜利。他要求各省市代表回去以后，首先要做重点试验，总结经验，召开地方现场会议，在大家相信以后，再大力推广，让“土”球墨铸铁遍地开花，使地方机械工业迅速地发展起来。
    各地代表还广泛交流了暖风炉、碱性炉、中性炉衬以及炉外脱硫、炉内脱硫等简便易行的经验，在熔化和出铁的过程中，把土铁中的含硫量脱到最低限度，从而铸出了灰口铸件，解决了土铁铸一般机器铸件的问题。
