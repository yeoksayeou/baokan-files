To Strengthen Tea Garden Management and Strive for a Greater Harvest
The Ministry of Agriculture Issues Notice to Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities

(Our Report) The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in late November regarding the strengthening of tea garden management and production work this winter. The notice first pointed out: This year's tea production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The estimated annual output will reach more than 3 million dan, an increase of about 35% compared to 1957, and there have been many high-yield "satellite" farms with yields of more than 1,000 to 3,000 jin of dry tea per mu. The expanded area of tea gardens is expected to reach more than 4 million mu by the end of the year, exceeding the total increase in the previous eight years.

The notice then stated: Although tea production has made great achievements, it has not yet reached the historical peak, and it is still far from meeting domestic and foreign needs. In order to strive for continued leaps in next year's output, it is necessary to do a good job of tea garden management starting this winter.

The notice pointed out five key areas of management work for this winter: First, seize the opportunity to strengthen tea garden management this winter. Deep plowing and sufficient base fertilizer application in winter will lay a good foundation for the vigorous growth of tea trees and a bumper harvest of spring tea next year. All tea gardens are required to be deep plowed and fertilized with base fertilizer once.

Second, universally implement tea tree frost prevention measures this year. The experience of many regions last winter and this spring has proved that paying attention to tea tree frost prevention is an important key to ensuring increased spring tea production. Last year, the frost prevention area of tea gardens in Zhejiang Province reached 240,000 mu, accounting for more than 70% of the area that should be protected. The province's tea harvest this year is significantly related to doing a good job in frost prevention and preventing tea trees from suffering from cold damage. For young tea trees, special attention should be paid to protecting them so they can safely overwinter.

Third, do a good job of collecting tea seeds and cultivating and planting new tea gardens. According to reports from various regions, this year's tea seeds are growing well and there is a large quantity. It is a year of abundant harvest. Efforts should be made to mobilize the masses to arrange labor in a timely manner, carry out harvesting at the right time, and strive to collect well and collect thoroughly, so as to ensure that every seed is gathered.

Fourth, vigorously promote tool innovation and technological revolution. Next year, a technological revolution centered on tool innovation and the promotion of two-handed tea picking should be launched on the tea front. This year, various tea-making tools have been created and promoted in various places, which have shown great effect in improving tea quality and saving labor. Anhui Province saved more than 1.3 million labor days in the spring tea season alone due to the promotion of tea-making tools. The promotion of tools and the innovation of tea picking technology can solve the contradiction of insufficient labor in agricultural tea production. If mechanized and semi-mechanized tea making is realized next year, and two-handed tea picking is fully adopted, more than 100 million labor days can be saved nationwide.

Fifth, many regions have doubled or tripled their tea production this year, and many people's communes have achieved high-yield "satellites." Summarizing and promoting these advanced experiences is a major issue related to achieving breakthroughs in tea production next year. Various regions can adopt different methods to carry out this work.

### 加强茶园管理  争取更大丰收  农业部向各省、区、市发出通知

    加强茶园管理  争取更大丰收
    农业部向各省、区、市发出通知
    本报讯  农业部在11月下旬向各省、区、市发出了关于加强今年冬季茶园管理生产工作的通知。通知首先指出：今年的茶叶生产，取得了空前未有的大丰收。全年预计产量将达到三百万担以上，比1957年增产35％左右，并出现了不少亩产干茶一千到三千斤以上的高额丰产卫星。茶园扩大面积到年底预计可完成四百余万亩，超过了以往八年增加的总和。
    通知接着说：茶叶生产虽然有了巨大成绩，但还没有过关，没有超过历史上最高水平，距离国内、国外需要还很远。为了争取明年的产量继续跃进，就必须从今年冬季起作好茶园的管理工作。
    通知指出今冬管理工作的五个内容：一、抓紧今冬茶园管理。冬季要深耕，施足基肥，为明春茶树健壮生长，取得春茶大丰收，打下良好基础。要求所有茶园都作到深耕一次，施基肥一次。
    二、要普遍作好今年茶树防冻工作。去冬今春许多地区的经验证明，注意茶树防冻是保证春茶增产的重要关键。去年浙江省冬季茶园防冻面积达到二十四万亩，占应防面积的70％以上。该省今年取得茶叶丰收与作好防冻、免得茶树遭受寒害是有重大关系的。对幼龄茶树，更应特别注意保护其安全过冬。
    三、作好茶籽的采收和新茶园的垦辟种植。根据各地区的反映，今年茶籽生长好数量多，是获得丰收的一年，应及早发动群众安排好劳力，适时进行采收，尽量作到收好，收净，争取颗粒还家。
    四、大搞工具革新和技术革命。明年在茶叶战线上要掀起一个以工具革新和推广双手采茶为中心的技术革命。今年各地创造和推广了不少各种制茶工具，对提高茶叶品质节省劳力显示出巨大作用。安徽省由于制茶工具的推广，春茶一季就节省劳动日一百三十多万个。工具的推广和采茶技术的革新，可以解决农茶生产上劳力不足的矛盾。如果明年实现了机械化和半机械化制茶，全部采用双手采茶，全国就可节省采制劳动日一万万个以上。
    五、今年许多地区茶叶增产一倍至二倍，许多人民公社获得了高产卫星，总结和推广这些先进经验是关系明年茶叶生产过关的大事情。各地可采用不同方式，进行这一工作。
