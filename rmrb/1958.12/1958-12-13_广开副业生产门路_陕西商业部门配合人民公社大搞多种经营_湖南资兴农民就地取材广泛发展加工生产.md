    (By Our Newspaper) Shaanxi Province's People's Communes, with the cooperation of commercial departments, have vigorously developed diversified operations and achieved great success.
    This year, in addition to general increases in various economic crops in Shaanxi Province, various regions have also opened up many new sideline productions. Farmers in the mountainous areas of southern and northern Shaanxi have, for the first time this year, collected and processed wild fibers, oilseeds, and starches. In southern Shaanxi alone, more than ten million catties of ropes made from wild fibers have been processed. In addition, People's Communes in various regions have introduced rabbits, fish fry, tussah silkworms, etc., to carry out diversified operations. In the Guanzhong plains area, the new sideline of raising domestic rabbits alone has developed to 400,000. Pingli County, a mountainous area in southern Shaanxi with fewer business avenues in the past, has introduced horses, sheep, donkeys, rabbits, bees, fish, silkworms, etc., from Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and has begun to move towards diversified operations. Some communes operate two or thirty kinds of sideline businesses, while others operate as many as forty or fifty, with the variety of operations increasing by about double compared to the past. Due to the expansion of sideline avenues, it is expected that by the end of the year, after the busy season for sidelines this winter, the total sideline income of People's Communes throughout the province will exceed last year by more than double.
    The vigorous development of sideline production in People's Communes throughout Shaanxi Province has received great help from commercial departments at all levels. In order to open up new avenues for sideline production, commercial departments at all levels have actively investigated the resources for sideline production, studied new uses for sideline products, and experimented with and disseminated processing technologies. For example, more than 600 kinds of wild plant resources growing all over the mountains have been utilized this year. Currently, more than 1,000 wild plant processing factories have been established by commercial departments in cooperation with People's Communes, producing new sideline products such as rayon, sacks, ropes, cloth, oils, and starches. Utilizing various fresh fruits to process and produce dried fruits, preserves, and fruit wines is also a new sideline that commercial departments have helped People's Communes to add. During the season when large quantities of fresh fruits were on the market this spring and summer, the Shaanxi Provincial Non-Staple Food Trade Bureau organized commercial personnel and commune members from some counties to learn fresh fruit processing techniques in Hebei, Shanxi, Shanghai, and other places. After returning, they opened processing training classes in more than a dozen counties, helping farmers build more than 100 processing factories, and developing sideline processing of fresh fruits using local methods. They have organized 89 tons of apricot, peach preserves, green plum shreds and other products for export.
    Commercial departments have also found more than 20 sideline avenues for People's Communes in mountainous areas in livestock products, such as cattle and sheep hooves, squirrel skins, rabbit meat, and goat beards. Southern Shaanxi abounds in squirrels. The commercial department sent people to various counties in southern Shaanxi to order more than 6 million squirrel skins, preparing to process them into leather pants for export. Currently, the hunting teams of the People's Communes in the Qinling Mountains of southern Shaanxi are setting up traps to catch squirrels throughout the mountains and forests. In order to promote the development of livestock products, meat foods such as pigs, rabbits, and poultry, commercial departments in various regions have supplied and regulated more than 500,000 head of breeding pigs and piglets of Soviet Large White pigs and other breeds, more than 100,000 each of "Angora" and other improved breeds of rabbits and "Australian Black" and other improved breeds of chickens, and more than 50,000 catties of improved breed eggs, accelerating the development of sidelines in People's Communes in various regions. This year, commercial departments in six large and medium-sized industrial cities, including Xi'an, Tongchuan, and Baoji, supplied more than 20,000 catties of various vegetable seeds, enabling People's Communes in these industrial and mining areas to accelerate the development of vegetable sidelines. The autumn and winter vegetable fields planted this year have expanded by more than 53,000 mu compared to last year. Commercial departments in various regions have established bases for breeding various improved varieties to supply People's Communes with various high-quality varieties. They have now helped more than 50 counties establish breeding and propagation farms for improved breed pigs. "Wild Animal Domestication and Breeding Farms" have been built in six counties, including Yulin, Huangling, Shangxian, and Lintong, to carry out the domestication and breeding of valuable animals such as Arctic foxes, silver foxes, beavers, and sables, and gradually supply People's Communes with large quantities to develop this sideline. In addition, commercial departments in medicinal material producing areas have personally helped to plant and cultivate experimental fields of safflower, whole scorpion, and coptis, enabling the cultivation of medicinal materials that were not originally available in the province to begin, and restoring the production of medicinal materials that had been suspended.
    (By Our Newspaper) After the CPC Zixing County Committee criticized the various erroneous ideas among cadres who did not pay attention to diversified operations while vigorously developing industrial and agricultural production, properly arranged the labor force, and fully relied on and mobilized the masses, various sideline productions have been smoothly carried out throughout the county. According to the specific circumstances, the People's Communes, in light of local conditions, have not only found more than 40 kinds of diversified operation avenues, with more than 550 small projects, but also closely combined industry, agriculture, commerce, and diversified operation. The four combinations are: First, diversified operation is combined with industry. In the past month, the county burned more than 1 million catties of charcoal, supporting iron production and meeting the needs of iron smelting. Through vigorously developing sidelines, the county has newly built 273 factories of various types, including 8 paper mills, 191 starch processing factories, 39 bamboo ware processing factories, 17 brick and tile factories, and 18 other factories. Second, diversified operation is combined with basic construction. In the past month, the county felled 700,000 bamboo poles and more than 50,000 cubic meters of wood, and also prepared more than 1,000 essential production tools (carrying poles, shovel handles) for the Dongjiang Hydropower Station construction site. Third, diversified operation is combined with agriculture. During this period, the county produced 2.5 million catties of sweet potato starch and more than 50,000 small farm tools (such as rice baskets, baskets, etc.), which not only found a way out for agricultural products, but also supplied agricultural tools. Fourth, diversified operation is combined with commercial work. The total amount of rural purchases by the county's Commercial Bureau in late November reached more than 130,000 yuan, an increase of more than two times compared with mid-November, and the sales volume also increased by one time. The county bank's recovery of rural loans in late November also increased by 33% compared with early November. More importantly, People's Communes have increased their cash income, solving the current needs in production and life. The Lanshi People's Commune received 360,000 yuan from sidelines. In addition to meeting the monthly wages of commune members and the living expenses of commune members, it also purchased 50 rubber-wheeled vehicles, 5 million catties of lime, and other various production materials worth a total of 140,000 yuan. In addition, 5,000 pieces of winter clothing, 800 quilts, 4,000 pieces of rain gear, and 10,000 pairs of socks were purchased for poor commune members.
    Because Zixing County closely combines diversified operation with various tasks, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Recently, various places have come up with many ways to make the avenues for diversified operation broader. After the masses of the Chengguan People's Commune put forward the slogan of "ten demands" such as demanding paper from bamboo, demanding oil and wine from wild fruits, and demanding medicinal materials from mountains, they immediately found more than 40 projects and earned more than 130,000 yuan in a week.

    广开副业生产门路
    陕西商业部门配合人民公社大搞多种经营
    湖南资兴农民就地取材广泛发展加工生产
    本报讯  陕西省各地人民公社在商业部门的配合下，大力开展多种经营，取得了很大的成绩。
    今年陕西省除各种经济作物一般都有增产外，各地还开辟了很多新的副业生产。陕南、陕北山区农民今年第一次对野生纤维、油料、淀粉等进行了采集和加工。仅陕南已加工成野生纤维绳子就达一千多万斤。此外，各地人民公社还分别引入家兔、鱼苗、柞蚕等开展多种经营。关中平川地区今年仅家兔一项新副业就发展了四十万只。陕南山区中经营门路原来较少的平利县，从内蒙古、陕北、四川等地引进马、羊、驴、兔、蜂、鱼、蚕等，开始走向多种经营。一个公社经营的副业少的有二、三十种，多的达四、五十种，经营品种都比过去增加一倍上下。由于副业门路的扩大，预计经过今冬副业旺季直到年底，全省各地人民公社的副业总收入要超过去年一倍多。
    陕西省各地人民公社副业生产的蓬勃发展，得到了各级商业部门很大的帮助。为了开辟副业生产的新门路，各级商业部门都积极调查副业生产的资源，研究副业产品的新用途，试验和传播加工技术。例如满山生长的有六百多种野生植物资源，今年已被利用起来。现经各地商业部门协助各人民公社办的野生植物加工厂已有一千余个，生产人造棉、麻袋、绳索、布匹、油料、淀粉等新的副业产品。利用各种鲜果加工制成果干、果脯、果酒等产品，也是各地商业部门帮助人民公社新增加的副业。在今年春夏大量鲜果上市季节，陕西省副食品贸易局组织一些县的商业人员和公社社员，到河北、山西、上海等地学习鲜果加工技术，回来后便在十几个县开了加工训练班，帮助农民建起一百多个加工厂，用土办法开展鲜果加工副业，已组织了八十九吨杏、桃脯、青梅丝等产品出口。
    商业部门为山区人民公社在畜产品上也寻到牛羊蹄角、松鼠皮、兔肉、山羊胡二十多项副业门路。陕南山里盛产松鼠，商业部门派人到陕南各县订了六百多万张松鼠皮的合同，准备加工制成皮裤出口。目前，陕南秦岭山里的各人民公社的打猎队，都在山林上遍设捉松鼠的套子。为了促进生猪、家兔、家禽等畜产、肉食品的发展，各地商业部门曾供应和调剂了苏联大白猪等种猪、仔猪五十多万头，“安哥拉”等良种兔和“澳洲黑”等良种鸡各十多万只、良种蛋共计五万多斤，使各地人民公社加速发展副业。西安、铜川、宝鸡等六个大中工业城市商业部门今年供应了二万多斤各种菜籽，使这些工矿区各人民公社加快发展蔬菜副业。今年种的秋、冬菜田就比去年扩大了五万三千多亩。各地商业部门为供应人民公社各种优良品种，建立了各种繁殖良种的基地。现已帮助五十多个县建立了良种生猪配种繁殖场。在榆林、黄陵、商县、临潼等六县建成“野兽驯化饲养场”，对北极狐、银狐、海狸鼠、紫貂等珍贵兽类进行驯养和繁殖工作，逐步供给各人民公社大量发展这种副业。此外，药材产地商业部门还亲自帮助种养红花、全虫、黄连等试验田，使省内原来没有的药材开始种养，并恢复了已停产的药材生产。
    本报讯  中共湖南资兴县委在大搞工农业生产的同时，批判了干部中不重视多种经营的种种错误思想以后，妥善安排劳动力，充分依靠与发动群众，各项副业生产在全县已顺利开展起来。各人民公社根据具体情况，因地制宜，不仅找出了多种经营的门路四十多种，小项目达五百五十多项，把工业、农业、商业与多种经营四个方面紧密结合起来。四结合是：一、多种经营与工业相结合。一个月来，全县烧出了一百多万斤木炭，支援了生铁生产，满足了炼铁的需要。通过大搞副业，全县新建各种工厂二百七十三个，其中造纸厂八个，淀粉加工厂一百九十一个，竹器加工厂三十九个，砖瓦厂十七个，其他工厂十八个。二、多种经营与基本建设相结合。一个月来全县砍伐楠竹七十万根、木材五万多立方公尺，还为东江水电站工地准备必需的生产工具（扁担、铁锹柄）一千多件。三、多种经营与农业相结合，这一时期全县生产了红薯淀粉二百五十万斤，小型农具（如米箩、箢箕等）五万多件，既为农产品找到出路，又供应了农业上的工具。四、多种经营与商业工作相结合，仅县商业局11月下旬农村收购总额就达到十三万余元，比中旬增加二倍以上，销售额亦增长了一倍。县银行11月下旬收回农村贷款也比上旬增长33％。更重要的是各人民公社由于现金收入增多，解决了当前生产、生活上的需要。兰市人民公社从副业上收入三十六万元，除了满足当月社员工资和社员生活费用外，还购进了胶轮车五十部，石灰五百万斤，以及其他各种生产资料共值十四万元。另外，为贫困社员购置了寒衣五千件，棉被八百床，雨具四千件，袜子一万双。
    由于资兴县把多种经营与各项工作紧密结合起来，群众情绪很高，最近，各地又想出了很多办法，使多种经营的门路更为广阔。城关人民公社群众就提出了向竹子要纸，向野果要油要酒，向山地要药材等“十要”口号后，一下就找到了四十多项门路，一星期内就收入十三万多元。（附图片）
