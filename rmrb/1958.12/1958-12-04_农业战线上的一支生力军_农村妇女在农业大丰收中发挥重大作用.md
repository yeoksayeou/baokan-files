A Vital Force on the Agricultural Front
Rural Women Play a Significant Role in the Great Agricultural Harvest

    (Reported by this newspaper) Rural women across the country have played a significant role in this year's great agricultural harvest. Their contributions in areas such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, field management, and sideline production prove that they are fully capable of becoming a main force in agricultural production.
    This year, the number of rural women actively participating in production is unprecedented. In some areas, after a large number of male laborers were transferred to industries and water conservancy projects, women became the main force in field cultivation. In Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, 700,000 young and middle-aged women broke with convention and went barefoot into the fields to work. In Tancheng County, Shandong Province, there are currently more than 200,000 women, forming three major armies for winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy, making the county's production a lively scene. This soaring enthusiasm of women has become a common sight in rural areas across the country.
    Women have skillfully mastered various agricultural production techniques, and have run experimental fields on a large scale, creating many high-yield records. Women in Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, Gansu, Hebei, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces have universally established experimental fields. In many areas, basically every commune has a women's experimental team, and every team has a women's experimental field. In Hebei Province, more than 1.35 million female cadres and activists have cultivated 3.06 million mu of high-yield and large-area high-yield fields, creating more than 220 high-yield records of over 1,000 jin per mu. In the Hengyang area of Hunan, 980,000 women invested in agricultural production have basically mastered one technical skill each. They adopted the method of learning as they worked, and more than 400,000 women learned the technology of close-planting rice seedlings. In the winter deep-plowing movement, more than 80,000 women became deep-plowing experts. Hubei Province launched a vigorous "Million Girls" and "Production Experts Competition." So far, more than 2,027,000 bumper harvest girls have emerged throughout the province, cultivating more than 2,820,000 mu of experimental fields. The number of participants in the experimental fields accounted for 36% of the province's female labor force. Cotton girl Zhou Tingying's experimental field yielded 6,308.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and rice girl Peng Xueying's experimental field yielded 5,821 jin of rice per mu.
    In Henan Province, more than 2,022,000 women cultivated more than 2,080,000 mu of experimental fields, and many high-yield satellite fields emerged. For example, the women's experimental field of the Zhuji People's Commune in Huaiyang County yielded 65,503 jin of rice per mu, and the women's experimental field of the Mengjin People's Commune in Suiping County yielded 7,201 jin of wheat per mu. In Anhui Province, Hao Xiuying and Communist Youth League members of the Outang People's Commune in Dingyuan County cultivated 1.9 mu of sweet potatoes, with an average yield of more than 210,000 jin per mu, and an average weight of 10 jin per sweet potato.
    Women in various places have undertaken the main tasks in sideline production such as pig and chicken raising, and have made outstanding contributions. The "March 8th" Women's Pig Farm in the Sijiqing People's Commune of Haidian District, Beijing, has 22 female feeders out of 32 feeders. The farm raises more than 1,100 pigs, with a survival rate of 96.5%, becoming a red flag in the collective pig raising industry in Beijing. Among the twelve feeders in the Wanneng Pig Farm of the Yinshan People's Commune in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, ten are young women. They have completely adopted new feeding and management methods for the more than 250 pigs they raise, establishing a piglet cafeteria, a piglet nursery, a piglet dormitory, and a piglet bathhouse. They also established medical stations and nursing homes for sick and weak pigs, as well as mating stations and delivery stations. As a result, the sow litter rate and the piglet survival rate have significantly improved compared to the past, and have been praised by the commune members. (Attached picture)

    农业战线上的一支生力军
    农村妇女在农业大丰收中发挥重大作用
    本报讯  全国农村妇女，在今年的农业生产大丰收中起了重大作用。她们在兴修水利、积肥、田间管理、副业生产等方面作出的贡献，证明她们完全能够成为农业生产上的主力军。
    今年农村妇女积极参加生产，参加的人数是空前的，有些地方在大量男劳动力转到工业、水利等战线以后，妇女就成了田间耕作的主力。四川省温江专区七十万青壮年妇女都打破常规脱鞋下田劳动。山东省郯城县目前有二十多万名妇女，组成冬翻、积肥、水利三路大军，把全县的生产搞得热火朝天。妇女们的这种冲天干劲，在全国农村中已经成为普遍的景象。
    妇女们熟练地掌握了农业生产的各种技术，并且大办试验田，创造了许多高产纪录。湖北、湖南、四川、山西、江苏、河南、江西、甘肃、河北、浙江、安徽等省妇女办试验田的十分普遍，许多地区基本上作到了社社有妇女试验队，队队有妇女试验田。河北省有一百三十五万多名妇女干部和积极分子搞了高额丰产田和大面积丰产田共三百零六万多亩，创造了亩产千斤以上的丰产纪录二百二十多个。湖南衡阳地区，投入农业生产的九十八万名妇女，基本上做到了每人精通一门技术。她们采取做什么学什么的办法，有四十多万名妇女学会了密植插秧技术，在冬季深耕运动中有八万多个妇女成为深耕能手。湖北省开展了轰轰烈烈的“百万姑娘”与“生产能手竞赛运动”，到目前为止，全省出现了二百零二万七千多丰产姑娘，种了二百八十二万多亩试验田。参加试验田的人数占全省妇女劳力的36％，棉花姑娘周廷英种的试验田亩产籽棉六千三百零八斤五两，水稻姑娘彭学英种的试验田亩产水稻五千八百二十一斤。
    河南全省有二百零二万二千多妇女种了二百零八万亩试验田，出现了许多高额丰产卫星田，如淮阳县朱集人民公社妇女试验田亩产水稻六万五千五百零三斤，遂平县猛进人民公社妇女试验田亩产小麦七千二百零一斤，安徽省定远县藕塘人民公社妇女郝秀英和共青团员们培植的一亩九分山芋，平均亩产二十一万多斤，平均每棵山芋有十斤重。
    各地妇女在养猪、养鸡等副业生产上担负了主要的任务，并且作出了出色的贡献。北京市海淀区四季青人民公社的“三八”妇女养猪场，在三十二个饲养员中有二十二个是女的，全场养猪一千一百多头，猪的成活率达到96.5％，成为北京市集体养猪事业中的一面红旗。四川省资中县银山人民公社万能养猪场的十二名饲养员中有十名是年轻妇女，她们对饲养的二百五十多头猪完全采取了新的饲养管理方法，建立了小猪食堂、小猪托儿所、小猪宿舍、小猪浴池，还为病猪、弱猪举办了医疗站、疗养院，有配种站、接生站，这样作的结果，母猪的产仔率和小猪的成活率比过去显著提高，受到了社员们的称赞。（附图片）
