Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education, and the Nationalities Affairs Commission recently jointly convened a national conference on publishing work for minority nationalities.

Under the care and leadership of the Party, China's socialist publishing work for minority nationalities has developed from scratch and from small to large over the past nine years since liberation. To date, a Central Nationalities Publishing House and ten local nationalities publishing houses have been established, publishing various books in eighteen ethnic minority languages, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Bouyei, Korean, Kazakh, Dai, Kawa, Hani, Li, Kirghiz, Lisu, Lahu, Jingpo, and Xibe. These books include classic works of Marxism-Leninism, especially the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, policy documents issued by the Party and the state, as well as works on social sciences, natural sciences, literature and art, textbooks, dictionaries, etc. Works on ethnic issues are also published in Chinese. According to statistics, from 1952 to the end of 1957, a total of 6,751 kinds of books in various ethnic minority languages were published, totaling 61,210,000 copies. These books have played a coordinating and promoting role in expanding the Party's influence among the people of all ethnic minorities, consolidating the unity of the motherland, strengthening unity among all ethnic groups, promoting the socialist revolution and socialist construction in ethnic minority areas, and prospering and developing culture, education, science and technology in ethnic minority areas. In particular, the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Mongolian, Uyghur, and Korean, and the "Red Flag" magazine in four ethnic minority languages, are of great significance in the political and cultural life of ethnic minority peoples.

In order to adapt to the new situation of great leaps forward, great development, great unity, and great collaboration that has emerged in ethnic minority areas, the conference, after full discussion, further clarified that the future direction of ethnic minority publishing work must be to serve industrial and mining areas and troops, serve rural and pastoral areas, and take workers, peasants, soldiers, and other working people as the main target audience. It should publicize Marxism-Leninism, socialist and communist ideology, the Party's general line for socialist construction and various major policies, patriotism and the development of the great motherland, the Marxist-Leninist view on nationalities and the Party's ethnic policies, popularize scientific and cultural knowledge, and serve to consolidate the unity of the motherland, strengthen national unity, and promote the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups on the basis of socialism.

This conference adopted the spirit of rectification, using the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to conduct a concentrated exposure and criticism of reactionary local nationalism, capitalist ideology, and the propagation of religious superstition in ethnic minority publishing work. The conference also criticized right-leaning conservative ideas in ethnic minority publishing work, as well as erroneous tendencies to varying degrees of neglecting politics, being divorced from reality, and being divorced from the masses.

The conference also conducted full discussions and research on important issues in ethnic minority publishing work, such as continuing to overcome local nationalism, cultivating a contingent of cadres who are both red and expert, and quickly and correctly solving minority language teaching materials, and correctly dealing with new terms and phrases and Chinese loanwords in ethnic minority languages, and reached a consensus.

During the conference, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Chen Zenggu, Vice Minister of Education, Wang Feng, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Sa Kongliao gave reports on cultural, educational, ethnic policies, and the direction and tasks of ethnic minority publishing work.

    民族出版会议确定今后出版工作方针
    新华社22日讯文化部、教育部、民族事务委员会最近联合召开了全国少数民族出版工作会议。
    在党的关怀和领导下，我国少数民族的社会主义的出版事业，解放九年来已经从无到有、从少到多地发展起来。到目前为止，已经建立了一个中央民族出版社和十个地方民族出版社，用蒙古、藏、维吾尔、苗、彝、僮、布依、朝鲜、哈萨克、傣、佧佤、哈尼、黎、柯尔克孜、傈僳、拉祜、景颇、锡伯等十八种民族文字出版了各种图书，其中包括马克思列宁主义的经典著作，特别是毛泽东同志的著作，党和国家发布的政策文件，以及社会科学、自然科学、文学艺术、教科书、辞书等等，同时也用汉文出版有关民族问题方面的著作。据统计，全国从1952年到1957年底，共出版了各民族文字的图书六千七百五十一种，共六千一百二十一万册。这些图书，对于扩大党在各少数民族人民中的影响，巩固祖国的统一和加强各民族之间的团结，对于推动少数民族地区的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，以及繁荣和发展少数民族地区的文化教育、科学技术等各方面，都起了配合和促进作用。特别是用蒙古、维吾尔、朝鲜等三种文字出版的“毛泽东选集”和用四种少数民族文字出版的“红旗”杂志，在少数民族人民的政治生活和文化生活中，具有重大的意义。
    为了适应少数民族地区业已出现的大跃进、大发展、大团结、大协作的新形势，会议经过充分的讨论，进一步明确了今后少数民族出版工作的方针必须是面向工矿、部队，面向农村、牧区，以工农兵及其他劳动人民为主要对象，宣传马克思列宁主义，宣传社会主义和共产主义思想，宣传党的社会主义建设总路线和各项重大政策，宣传爱国主义和伟大祖国的发展，宣传马克思列宁主义的民族观和党的民族政策，普及科学文化知识，为巩固祖国统一，加强民族团结，促使各民族在社会主义基础上的发展和繁荣服务。
    这次会议采取整风精神，通过大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方式，对民族出版工作中的反动的地方民族主义思想、资本主义思想和宣传宗教迷信思想等，进行了集中的揭露和批判。会议也批判了民族出版工作中的右倾保守思想，不同程度的忽视政治、脱离实际和脱离群众的错误倾向。
    会议并就继续克服民族出版工作中的地方民族主义思想，培养又红又专的干部队伍，以及迅速、正确解决少数民族文字教材，正确对待少数民族语文中的新词术语、汉语借词等民族出版工作中的一些重要问题，进行了充分的讨论和研究，并取得了一致的认识。
    会议期间，文化部副部长钱俊瑞、教育部副部长陈曾固、民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、萨空了，曾作了有关文化、教育、民族政策和民族出版工作的方针任务方面的报告。
