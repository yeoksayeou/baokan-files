One Year Equals a Thousand Years
Minority Nationalities Achieve Brilliant Successes on All Fronts This Year

(By our dispatch) In the great leap forward year of 1958, China's minority nationalities, with the high speed of one year equaling a thousand, achieved brilliant successes on all fronts of socialist motherland construction. The social and economic landscape of most minority nationality areas underwent significant changes. This is a great victory for the Party's nationality policy and the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction.

In areas inhabited by over 90% of the nation's minority population, under the leadership of the Party, and through rectification and socialist education movements, the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory. Many of these minority nationalities have leapt over one or several stages of social development, from feudalism, slavery, or even primitive communal systems, directly into the socialist system. Now, the unity and cooperation among all nationalities is even more consolidated and strengthened. On this basis, all minority nationalities across the country have launched a high tide of a comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction, and the vast majority of minority nationality areas have basically realized people's communes. With the development of the great leap forward in construction and the people's commune movement, our nation's ethnic relations are developing into socialist ethnic relations. People of all ethnic groups work and live together in the communes, and their relationships are becoming increasingly close. The most prominent feature of these socialist ethnic relations is great unity, great collaboration, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, common labor, common life, common development, and common prosperity.

Inspired by the nationwide great leap forward and with the help of the Han nationality, the vast minority nationalities have seen earth-shaking changes in agricultural production this year. Like the Han areas, grain production in most minority nationality areas has increased several times over. Many remote mountainous areas that used to rely on grain supplies from other places have, for the first time this year, had surplus grain to support national construction. Having shattered the exploitative system and mental shackles, the minority nationality people have demonstrated the tenacity to transform nature. Last winter and this spring, many minority nationalities built water conservancy projects on a large scale in freezing weather. They broke with all kinds of conventions, superstitions, and backward customs, and went to work as usual on what used to be production "taboo days." Many minority nationality women plowed the fields for the first time this year. Deep plowing and meticulous cultivation began to replace the slash-and-burn and extensive cultivation with low yield practices that were prevalent in minority nationality areas. Minority nationalities, who never used to apply fertilizer to the land, have this year built aerial cableways and wooden rail transport systems to transport large quantities of fertilizer to the fields. New-style farm tools have replaced primitive and backward production tools such as wooden plows, wooden harrows, wooden hoes, and two-oxen tandem plows. The practice of using oxen to tread the fields, hand weeding, and hand picking of ears has disappeared in many minority nationality areas in the south. These situations show that China's minority nationalities have leapt to a new stage in agricultural production, creating extremely favorable conditions for the great leap forward in agriculture next year.

Over 90% of China's grassland pastures are located in minority nationality areas, and these areas have also seen a new situation of leaping development in animal husbandry production. This year, the survival rate of young livestock in most pastoral areas has reached over 90%. The net increase rate of livestock in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang has reached about 20%. This year, many pastoral areas have also established grain and feed bases. Herdsmen have changed their nomadic lives of following water and grass for thousands of years, and have universally promoted settled nomadism. Some places have even realized the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry.

The iron and steel banner has been raised in minority nationality areas, and a nationwide movement to run industries has formed a surge in these areas. In Inner Mongolia, only Hohhot and Ulanhot had iron smelting furnaces last year, but this year there are hundreds of places that can smelt iron. The main towns of the autonomous region have also initially formed a machinery manufacturing and repair network. In Xinjiang, newly built factories and mines can be seen everywhere north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The slogan of the people of all ethnic groups here is to build the autonomous region into one of the country's petroleum, metal, coal, textile, and sugar industry bases. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has never produced a ton of steel, is now vigorously engaged in iron and steel smelting. In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where the foundation of the iron and steel industry is weak, many industrialized iron and steel industrial bases are gradually taking shape through the nationwide movement to run iron and steel. In the minority nationality areas on the Yunnan border, which had no industry in the past, locally produced agricultural tools, transportation tools, and various daily necessities are now being used. The Yi people in the Liangshan Mountains of Sichuan, who were just liberated from the slave system, and the Oroqen hunters who have lived in the primeval forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains for generations, have also started to run industries. With the development of industry in the minority nationality areas, there are more and more workers from minority nationalities. For example, the Jingpo and Kawa nationalities have seen their first batch of workers from their own ethnic groups. Minority nationality areas account for about 60% of China's land area and are rich in resources. The establishment of various factories and mines in these areas, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, will play an important role in the prosperity of the local minority nationalities and the socialist construction of the country.

The historically backward cultural landscape of the various minority nationalities has also undergone great changes this year. Primary school education has now been popularized in the vast majority of minority nationality areas, and various spare-time schools are developing rapidly. The various minority nationalities, holding high the banner of cultural revolution, are eagerly demanding to get rid of the state of illiteracy that has persisted for generations. Many minority nationalities have achieved great success in eradicating illiteracy using newly created scripts for their own languages. For example, over one million people in Guangxi participated in Zhuang script literacy classes this year. The Qiandongnan and Qiannan Autonomous Prefectures in Guizhou have become basically literate prefectures. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has formed a relatively complete education network from primary school and middle school to university. Some minority nationalities have finally ended the backward state of recording events by carving wood and tying knots, and this year they are using writing for the first time to spread advanced production experiences. Under the loud slogan of "Learn from the Han, Catch up with the Han," many minority nationalities are actively learning the Han language.

    一年等于千百年
    少数民族今年在各个战线上取得光辉成就
    本报讯  我国少数民族在大跃进的1958年中，用一年等于千百年的高速度，在建设社会主义祖国的各条战线上取得了光辉的成就，绝大部分少数民族地区的社会面貌和经济面貌发生了重大变化，这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。
    全国有90％以上少数民族人口的地区，在党的领导下，经过整风和社会主义教育运动，社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。其中有许多少数民族是从封建制度、奴隶制度、甚至原始公社制度，超越一个或几个社会发展阶段，跃进到社会主义制度的。现在，各民族间的团结合作是更加巩固和加强了。在这个基础上，全国各少数民族掀起了社会主义建设全面大跃进的高潮，绝大部分少数民族地区已基本上实现了人民公社化。随着建设大跃进和人民公社化运动的发展，我国的民族关系正发展成为社会主义的民族关系，各族人民在公社里一起劳动和生活，关系已越来越密切，这种社会主义的民族关系，最为显著的特征就是大团结、大协作、学先进、赶先进、共同劳动、共同生活、共同发展和共同繁荣。
    广大少数民族在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞和汉族的帮助下，今年农业生产出现了翻天复地的变化。大部分民族地区和汉族地区一样，粮食产量成倍地增长。许多一向依靠外地供应粮食的边远山区，今年都第一次有余粮支援国家建设。粉碎了剥削制度和精神枷锁的少数民族人民，在向大自然作战中表现出开天辟地的毅力。去冬今春，许多少数民族在天寒地冻季节大修水利，他们打破了各种常规、迷信和落后的习俗，在过去的生产“忌日”照常出工。许多少数民族妇女都是在今年第一次扶犁耕田。深耕细作开始代替了少数民族地区普遍存在的刀耕火种和广种薄收的习惯。过去从不向地里施肥的少数民族，今年大搞空中索道和木轨运输，向田里运送大量肥料。新式农具代替了木犁、木耙、木锄、二牛抬杠等原始落后的生产工具。过去用牛踏田、用手耘田和用手捻穗的情况已经在南方的许多少数民族地区绝迹。这些情况表明，我国少数民族在农业生产上已经飞跃到一个崭新的阶段，为明年的农业大跃进创造了极为有利的局面。
    我国的草原牧场，90％以上都是在少数民族地区，这些地区的畜牧业生产也出现了飞跃发展的新局面。今年绝大部分牧业区的幼畜成活率都达到90％以上。内蒙古、新疆的牲畜纯增率达到20％左右。今年很多牧区还建立了粮食、饲料基地，牧民们改变了千百年来逐水草而居的游牧生活，普遍推行定居游牧，有些地方还实现了农牧结合。
    钢铁帅旗已在少数民族地区升起，全民办工业已在这些地区形成热潮。内蒙古在去年只有呼和浩特和乌兰浩特两个地方有炼铁炉，今年就有好几百处可以炼铁，自治区的主要城镇，还初步形成了机械制造网和修配网。在新疆天山南北到处可以看到新建的厂矿，这里各族人民的口号是，要把自治区建成为祖国的石油、金属、煤炭、纺织和制糖工业基地之一。从来没有产过一吨钢的广西僮族自治区，今年大搞炼铁炼钢。钢铁工业基础薄弱的宁夏回族自治区，经过全民大办钢铁运动，许多工厂化的钢铁工业基地正在逐步形成。过去没有工业的云南边疆少数民族地区，今年已开始使用当地生产的农具、运输工具和各种日用品。四川大凉山刚从奴隶制度下解放出来的彝族人民，世居大兴安岭原始森林里的鄂伦春猎民，今年也办起了工业。随着民族地区工业的发展，少数民族的工人越来越多了，像景颇族、佧佤族都出现了本民族的第一批工人。少数民族地区占我国土地面积的60％左右，资源十分丰富，这些地区的各种厂矿像雨后春笋一样地建立起来，对当地少数民族的繁荣和全国的社会主义建设将起重要的作用。
    各少数民族历史上遗留下来的文化落后面貌，今年也有很大的变化。绝大部分少数民族地区现在已普及了小学教育，各种业余学校正在迅速发展。各少数民族高举文化革命的旗帜，迫切要求摆脱世世代代的文盲状态。许多少数民族用新创制的本民族文字扫盲，取得很大成绩，像广西今年参加僮文扫盲的就有一百多万人。贵州黔东南和黔南两个自治州都已成为基本无文盲州。延边朝鲜族自治州并已形成从小学、中学到大学的较为完整的教育网。有的少数民族最后结束了刻木结绳记事的落后状态，今年第一次用文字来传播先进的生产经验。许多少数民族在“学汉族、赶汉族”的响亮口号下，积极学习汉族语文。
