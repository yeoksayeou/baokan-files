It was jointly discussed by the Institute of Experimental Medicine, the Institute of Materia Medica, the Institute of Pediatrics, the Fuwai Hospital, the Department of Internal Medicine of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the Department of Surgery, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Department of Neurology, and the Department of Stomatology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Zhang Zhinan wrote the article.

The Party pointed out long ago that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is part of the rich cultural heritage of the motherland. It has accumulated the valuable experience of past generations in fighting various diseases, established a unique system in the field of world medicine, and has great research value and development prospects. In recent years, countless facts have confirmed the correctness of the Party's TCM policy. At present, a nationwide upsurge of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM is being set off, which shows that the broad masses of medical workers have a further understanding of the Party's policy and are eager to learn TCM as soon as possible. But what exactly should be learned and how? There must be a correct understanding. Through our four months of study at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, we have further realized that the Party's TCM policy of "systematic study, comprehensive mastery, consolidation and improvement" is very correct. Only by listening to the Party can we learn well.

In the past, TCM was often regarded as purely "empirical medicine." Before we started learning, we also doubted whether TCM really had a mature theory. But as we began to learn, we gradually realized that TCM not only has rich experience, but also a complete theory summarized from experience. The overall ideological system of simple materialism, yin-yang and five elements theory, is implemented in all aspects of TCM. Yin and yang represent the two sides of things, explaining the relationship between the opposites and unity of things. The five elements theory further explains the internal relationship between things. TCM flexibly uses the yin-yang and five elements theory, and has created the "image-based theory" and "meridian theory" in terms of human body function activities, the famous "nineteen disease mechanisms" in terms of pathology and etiology, the eight principles in diagnosis, the eight methods in treatment, plus a series of views on the relationship between man and nature, which constitute a very complete theoretical system.

We came from various departments, and at first each had its own plans. Most of them just wanted to find some effective Chinese medicine prescriptions suitable for their own departments through learning. The gynecology department was eager to learn gynecology, and the stomatology department was eager to find information related to stomatology. Even when we first started learning the Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Shanghan Lun), we felt that the Treatise on Febrile Diseases was an internal medicine problem and had little to do with gynecology and surgery. In the process of learning, we gradually realized that TCM has a unique theoretical system, and the principles of gynecology, pediatrics, internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture, massage, and syndrome differentiation and treatment are all the same. Studying the Treatise on Febrile Diseases is to learn these general principles. For example, in stomatology, although it is impossible to learn ready-made prescriptions for treating oral diseases from the Treatise on Febrile Diseases for a while, learning the method of syndrome differentiation and treatment may lead to the creation of more prescriptions in the future. Moreover, the prescriptions listed in the Treatise on Febrile Diseases are not limited to exogenous diseases. For example, the same Minor Bupleurum Decoction (Xiao Chai Hu Tang) can treat Shao Yang syndrome caused by exogenous diseases, and can also treat women's menstrual diseases. Without mastering the theory of TCM, it is impossible to understand the multiple indications for one prescription and multiple prescriptions for one indication in TCM. TCM conducts a careful analysis of each symptom. The same symptom may belong to deficiency or excess, and the treatment methods are completely different. For example, for the symptom of constipation, according to its different causes, there are methods such as purgation, nourishing yin, and moisturizing the intestines; for the same bleeding, there are different methods such as cooling the blood, nourishing the blood, tonifying qi, treating the liver, and treating the spleen. The use of TCM medicine is entirely based on syndrome differentiation, so it is impossible to tell us in general that a certain disease should be treated with a certain prescription, but rather to select different treatment methods according to the eight-principle attributes of the disease. Therefore, to learn from the treatment experience of TCM, it is impossible without systematically studying the theory of TCM.

Of course, this does not mean that in the current situation, in addition to comprehensive and systematic study, there will be no achievements in conducting some special studies on individual issues at the same time. Many good methods of TCM are simple and easy to implement. In order to make these essences serve the people as soon as possible, it is still good to conduct some individual studies before systematic study has been carried out. However, individual study should also have certain methods. For example, if we want to use a proven prescription of TCM in clinical practice, before we have mastered the method of syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM, we should ask a TCM practitioner to carefully explain the conditions for using that proven prescription according to the eight principles. When summarizing the efficacy, we should also consider whether the indications are appropriate.

The theory of TCM is completely different from the theory of Western medicine. It is not without difficulties for a Western medicine practitioner to fully accept the rich and colorful content of TCM comprehensively and systematically. Especially when encountering certain statements in TCM that cannot be explained by existing scientific arguments, doubts will arise about the theory of TCM. But we should trust the Party and listen to the Party. The Party wants us to learn TCM for a reason. The great achievements in protecting the health of the people for thousands of years are the most powerful proof of the science of TCM. Many examples show that the reason why a certain aspect of TCM cannot be explained by existing scientific views is precisely because the existing scientific level is insufficient. For example, the efficacy of acupuncture is generally recognized, but the existence of acupoints has not been proven by experiments for a long time. Today, meridian detectors have confirmed the existence of acupoints, opening up avenues for further research. In the eyes of Western medicine, gypsum is nothing more than non-absorbable calcium sulfate, but under the application of TCM, gypsum has an excellent effect of clearing internal heat. Western medicine believes that the effect of ephedra entirely depends on ephedrine, and ephedrine has the effect of treating asthma and maintaining blood pressure. However, the scope of TCM's use of ephedra is more than that. Thousands of years of experience have proven that "ephedra combined with cinnamon twig can induce sweating, ephedra combined with gypsum can clear the lungs with a cool and pungent effect, ephedra combined with licorice can be taken cold to promote urination, and ephedra combined with rehmannia can disperse cold stagnation in the yin aspect." The efficacy of ephedra cannot be represented by ephedrine alone. This shows that the current research on materia medica is not developed enough to make a credible evaluation of the scientific nature of TCM. Of course, this does not mean that every part of TCM is already perfect, but before we can fully accept it, before we can distinguish between essence and dross, and when we are just beginning to learn, it is best not to use the perspective of Western medicine to choose, but to learn honestly.

In short, TCM has its own complete ideological system, and to master TCM, we must study it comprehensively and systematically. The key to learning well is first of all to put politics in command ideologically, firmly believe in the Party, listen to the Party, break the superstition of Western medicine, establish the determination to dedicate ourselves to the development of traditional Chinese medicine and the integration of Chinese and Western medicine, and learn with humility. We will definitely be able to learn well.

    必须全面系统地学习中医
    中国医学科学院实验医学研究所佘铭鹏、陆钟琦，药物研究所雷海鹏，儿科研究所张梓荆，阜外医院刘丽生，协和医院内科史济招、张之南，外科朱预，妇产科葛秦生，谭蕴涛，脑系科杨蜀莲，口腔科钱雪君，共同讨论，张之南执笔。
    党很早就指出，中医是祖国丰富的文化遗产的一部分。它累积了历代人民对各种疾病进行斗争的宝贵经验，在世界医学领域中树立了一个独特的体系，有着极大的研究价值和发展前途。近年来，更有无数的事实证实了党的中医政策的正确性。目前，在全国范围内正掀起一个西医学习中医的热潮，这说明广大医务工作者对党的政策有了进一步的体会，迫切地希望早日学会中医。但究竟应该如何学，学些什么？还须要有正确的认识。我们通过在中医研究院四个月来的学习，进一步地体会到党所提出的“系统学习，全面掌握，整理提高”的中医政策，是非常正确的。只有听党的话才有可能学好。
    过去中医常常被认为是单纯的“经验医学”。我们学习以前，也曾经怀疑过中医是否真有一套成熟的理论。但当我们开始学习以后，逐渐认识到中医不但有丰富的经验，而且有一套从经验中总结出来的完整的理论。在中医的各个方面贯彻着一个总的思想体系——朴素的唯物主义的阴阳五行学说。阴阳代表事物的两面，说明事物对立与统一的关系，五行学说又进一步说明事物之间的内在联系。中医灵活地运用阴阳五行学说，在人体机能活动方面创立了“靠象论”“经络论”，在病理病因方面有著名的“病机十九条”，诊断有八纲，治疗有八法，加上对人与自然之间的关系的一系列看法，构成了一套非常完整的理论体系。
    我们来自各个科系，起初各有各的打算。大都只想通过学习，找到一些适用于本科的有效中医药方就算了。妇科的急于想学妇科，口腔科的急于想找到有关口腔科的资料。甚至在最初学伤寒论的时候，还觉得伤寒论是内科问题，与妇科、外科关系不大。在学习过程中，我们逐渐体会到中医有一套独特的理论体系，不论是妇科、儿科、内科、外科、针灸、按摩、辨证论治的法则都是一样的。学习伤寒论就是学习这些总的法则。即如口腔科，一时虽然不能从伤寒论中学习到治疗口腔疾病的现成方剂，但学会了辨证论治的方法，就可能在以后创立更多的方剂。而且，伤寒论所举出的方子，也并非只限用于外感，例如同一小柴胡汤，能治外感少阳病，也能治妇女月经病。不掌握中医的理论，就无法理解中医的一方多证，一证多方。中医对每一个症状都要进行仔细的分析。同一症状，可能属于虚，也可能属于实，在治法上就完全不同。例如便秘一症，根据它的不同病因，就有攻下、养阴、润导等法；同一出血，又有凉血、补血、补气、治肝、治脾等法的不同。中医用药完全根据辨证，因此不可能笼统地告诉我们某某病用某某方，而是根据疾病的八纲属性，选用不同治法。所以，要学习中医的治病经验，不系统学习中医的理论是不行的。
    当然，这不等于说在目前的情况下，除了全面系统地学习以外，在个别问题上同时进行一些专题学习不会有成绩，中医的很多好办法简单易行，为了使这些精华早日服务于人民，在未能系统地学习以前，个别地进行一些学习还是好的。但个别学习也要有一定方法，例如要想在临床上用中医的一个验方，在我们还没能掌握中医辨证论治的方法以前，应请中医根据八纲仔细地说明那个验方的使用条件，在总结疗效时也应该考虑适应症是否恰当的因素。
    中医的理论与西医的理论体系完全不同，要想全面系统地把中医丰富多采的内容全部接受，对一个西医来说，不是没有困难的，尤其当遇到中医的某些说法还不能用现有的科学论点加以说明时，就会对中医的理论产生怀疑。但是我们应该相信党，听党的话，党要我们学习中医是有根据的，几千年来保卫人民健康的巨大成绩就是中医科学的最有力的证明。许多例子说明，不能用现有的科学观点去解释中医的某一方面，正是由于现有的科学水平不足。例如针灸的疗效是大家公认的，但经穴的存在很久以来没有得到试验的证明，而今天经络探测仪就证实了经穴的存在，开辟了进一步研究的途径。石膏在西医的眼光中只不过是不能吸收的硫酸钙，但在中医的应用下，石膏有极好的清内热的作用。西医认为麻黄的作用全靠麻黄素，麻黄素有治喘和维持血压的作用，但中医用麻黄的范围却不止于此，数千年来的经验证明“麻黄与桂枝同用可以发汗，麻黄与石膏并用则辛凉清肺，麻黄与甘草共用冷服可以利尿，麻黄与熟地同捣能散阴分之寒结，麻黄根能止汗”，麻黄的效用绝非麻黄素所能代表。这说明现有的药物学研究还不发达，不能对中医的科学性做出可信的评价。当然这并不是说中医的任何部分都已经是十全十美的了，但在没能全盘接受下来以前，我们没有分清精华与糟粕以前，在刚刚开始学习的时候，顶好不用西医的眼光去选择，而要老老实实地去学。
    总之，中医有它一套完整的思想体系，要想掌握中医必须全面系统地学习。学习好坏的关键首先是要在思想上政治挂帅，坚定地相信党，听党的话，破除对西洋医学的迷信，树立为发展祖国医学、中西医合流而献身的决心，虚心地去学，一定可以学好。
