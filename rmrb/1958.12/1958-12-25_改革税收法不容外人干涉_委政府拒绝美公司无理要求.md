Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Caracas dispatch: The Venezuelan government yesterday rejected the demand by US oil companies that the government reconsider its income tax law, saying that such a demand was "intolerable." It is reported that Harold Haight, manager of Creole Petroleum Corporation, wrote to the Venezuelan Military Junta requesting that the Venezuelan government reconsider the recently promulgated tax law reform.

The news said that Venezuelan Military Junta Chairman Edgar Sanabria and Minister of Mines Julio Diez successively issued statements yesterday. In his statement, Julio Diez condemned the unreasonable demands of US companies, saying: "Haight's demand that the government reconsider measures taken without an act of sovereignty, and after careful and meticulous study, is an intolerable demand. These measures will not be changed in the slightest."

Xinhua News Agency, London, December 23rd: US oil tycoons are clamoring in opposition to the Venezuelan government because their huge profits have been slightly affected by Venezuela's recently announced tax law reform.

The "Financial Times" and other newspapers here published a statement by Haight, manager of Creole Petroleum Corporation, the largest US company in Venezuela, attacking Venezuela's newly revised tax law. He claimed that Venezuela was the first country to undermine the so-called "principle of equal profit sharing," and insisted that Venezuela "disregarded the obligation to consult morally (if not legally)." In addition, he threatened to reduce investment in Venezuela.

The "Financial Times" correspondent in New York reported that "US oil companies operating internationally are concerned about the immediate consequences of increased taxes... but are equally concerned about the possible repercussions," because the governments of other countries, especially those in the Middle East, might take Venezuela's actions "as a precedent to demand a greater share of oil profits." He pointed out that this step was taken "without prior consultation," which is also a precedent that could have repercussions.

The reason US oil tycoons are so annoyed is that Venezuela's new tax law has disrupted their plans. According to the newspaper's correspondent, under the new tax law, 63% of profits will be given to the Venezuelan government, compared to the current rate of about 56%. In this way, the net profits of US oil companies this year will obviously be "substantially encroached upon." He said that Creole Petroleum Corporation, according to its original estimates, was prepared to rake in $249 million in profits in nine months.

According to the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Caracas, Creole Petroleum Corporation manager Haight even said that the Venezuelan government's change in tax rates was a "breach of promise," and that oil companies that had obtained leases in the past two years "will now feel that they have been deceived."

According to the newspaper's correspondent, Venezuela's "El Mundo" believes that Haight's statement is "hostile." "El Mundo" pointed out that Venezuela's implementation of tax law reform is "within the scope of Venezuelan national sovereignty."

It is reported that, shocked by the Venezuelan government's announcement of tax law reform, the shares of foreign oil companies in Venezuela have fallen sharply in London and Wall Street.

### 改革税收法不容外人干涉  委政府拒绝美公司无理要求

    改革税收法不容外人干涉
    委政府拒绝美公司无理要求
    美国石油富豪痛心利润将减狂叫不已
    新华社24日讯  加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉政府昨天拒绝了美国石油公司提出的要政府重新考虑所得税税收法的要求，并且说这种要求是“不可容忍的”。据报道，克里奥尔石油公司经理哈罗德·海特曾写信给委内瑞拉军事委员会，要求委内瑞拉政府重新考虑新近颁布的改革税收法。
    消息说，委内瑞拉军事委员会主席埃德加·萨纳布里亚和矿业部长胡利奥·迪埃斯昨天相继发表了声明。胡利奥·迪埃斯在他的声明中谴责美国公司的无理要求，他说：“海特要求政府重新考虑不通过主权行动而采取的、并且经过慎密和细心研究的措施，这是种不可容忍的要求。这些措施是丝毫不会改变的。”
    新华社伦敦23日电  美国石油富豪因为他们的巨额利润略微受到了委内瑞拉最近宣布的改革税法的影响，大肆叫嚷反对委内瑞拉政府。
    “金融时报”和这里的其他报纸刊登了在委内瑞拉最大的美国公司——克里奥尔石油公司经理海特的一篇声明，攻击委内瑞拉新订的税收法。他说什么委内瑞拉是第一个破坏所谓“平分利润这一原则”的国家，并且硬说委内瑞拉“无视在道义上（如果不是法律上的话）应该进行商讨的义务”。此外，他还以减少在委内瑞拉的投资相威胁。
    “金融时报”驻纽约记者报道，“美国在国际上的石油公司在关心由于增加税收而在眼前引起的直接后果的同时……也同样担心它可能产生的反响”，因为其他各国的政府，特别是中东各国的政府可能把委内瑞拉的行动“当作先例，来要求分享更多的石油利润”，他指出，这一步骤是在“没有经过事先商讨”的情况下采取的，这也是一个可能产生反响的先例。
    美国石油富豪之所以如此恼怒，是因为委内瑞拉的新税收法打乱了他们的如意算盘，据这家报纸的记者说，根据新的税收法，有63％的利润将交给委内瑞拉政府，而现在的比例是56％左右。这样，美国石油公司在今年的纯利显然将被“大量侵吞”。他说，克里奥尔石油公司根据原来的估计，准备在九个月中捞取二亿四千九百万美元的利润。
    据“每日电讯报”驻加拉加斯记者报道，克里奥尔石油公司经理海特竟然说，委内瑞拉政府改变税额的做法是“违反诺言”的，他说，在近两年取得承租权的石油公司“现在将感到，它们是受骗了”。
    据这家报纸的记者报道，委内瑞拉“世界报”认为，海特的声明是“敌对的”。“世界报”指出，委内瑞拉实行改革税法是“属于委内瑞拉国家主权范围之内”。
    据悉，由于受到委内瑞拉政府宣布改革税收法的震动，在委内瑞拉的外国石油公司的股票在伦敦和华尔街急剧下跌。
