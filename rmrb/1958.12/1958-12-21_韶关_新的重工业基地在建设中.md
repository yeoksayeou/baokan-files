Shaoguan - A New Heavy Industry Base Under Construction

(Our report) A new heavy industry base will emerge in the south of the motherland. This base is located in Shaoguan City in northern Guangdong Province, an ancient "Southern Frontier Stronghold." Now, large numbers of builders are rushing to this ancient city every day, and the sound of grand construction awakens the mountains that have been sleeping for thousands of years. By mid-December, construction had begun on five above-quota projects: the Shaoguan Iron and Steel Complex, the South China Heavy Machinery Plant, the South China Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the Shaoguan Cable Factory, and the Wushi Thermal Power Plant. Another above-quota project, the Shaoguan Copper, Aluminum, and Zinc Smelting Plant, will also begin construction this year.

Guangdong was once considered a province with limited mineral resources and little prospect for developing heavy industry. In recent years, through the exploration of professional teams and the unfolding of the mass mineral reporting movement, especially through the practice of the mass steel-making campaign in the past few months, it has been confirmed that Guangdong has considerable underground resources, not only iron and coal, but also oil shale and various non-ferrous metals, especially in northern Guangdong, where resources are even more abundant. Shaoguan is geographically close to the relatively rich Lianyang, Quren, Nanling, and Luojiadu coal mines and the Lianping iron mine, and is also located on a major transportation route by land and water, making it an ideal place to build a heavy industry base.

The Shaoguan Iron and Steel Complex, the South China Heavy Machinery Plant, the South China Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the Shaoguan Cable Factory, and the Shaoguan Copper, Aluminum, and Zinc Smelting Plant, which are under construction or about to be constructed, are all the largest in South China in scale, and are relatively large in the country as well. The Shaoguan Iron and Steel Complex is a comprehensive complex enterprise mainly producing iron and steel. Like other larger iron and steel complexes in the country, it has quite large iron-smelting blast furnaces and steel-making furnaces. The enterprise also has several large factories attached to it, such as nitrogen fertilizer, thermal power generation, and refractory materials. After completion, the South China Heavy Machinery Plant can produce a variety of heavy machinery with an annual output of 30,000 tons. The plant has a 3,000-ton hydraulic press equipment required for processing large machine parts, and can manufacture equipment such as iron-smelting blast furnaces with a volume of 620 cubic meters, steel-making open-hearth furnaces with a capacity of 100 tons, steel rolling mills of 900 mm long and 800 mm wide, and coal mines with an annual output of 300,000 tons of coal. The South China Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the only one in South China, is about the same size as the largest Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant in China, with an annual output of 20,000 tons. It can manufacture relatively large and precise heavy machine tools of more than 10 tons, including 3.6-meter wide and 12-meter long gantry planers, and 5-meter diameter vertical lathes. The Shaoguan Cable Factory is also the only one in South China, and can produce 20,000 tons of copper and aluminum conductors for power cables and communication cables each year. The Shaoguan Copper, Aluminum, and Zinc Smelting Plant produces 60,000 tons of copper, aluminum, and zinc per year. The Wushi Thermal Power Plant can generate more than 200,000 kilowatts and will be connected with the Liuxi River, Nanshui, Xinfengjiang, Wengjiang, Shangyou Hydropower Station in Jiangxi Province, and Guangzhou, Maoming, Yangchun and other thermal power plants to form a powerful power transmission network.

According to the plan, next year, relatively large factories and mines such as a mining machinery plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons, a steel wire rope factory with an annual output of 60,000 tons, a textile factory with 50,000 spindles, and the Fandong Copper, Aluminum, and Zinc Mine with a daily output of 3,000 tons of ore will continue to be built; railways from Shaoguan to Ganzhou and Shaoguan to Shantou will also be built.

From the first quarter of 1959 to 1960, these factories will be completed and put into production one after another, and this heavy industry base can be basically completed. At that time, Shaoguan will transport and sell its various products to South China, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in heavy machinery, vigorously equipping various machinery manufacturing, metal mining and smelting industries, and accelerating the realization of electrification and the establishment of a complete communication network. This will play an important role in changing the weak industrial face of South China, achieving industrialization and agricultural mechanization at an earlier date.

At present, the whole country is vigorously supporting the construction of this heavy industry base. There are about 20,000 employees from all over the country who have come to Shaoguan to participate in the construction of key projects. Among the administrative cadres, technical personnel, and technicians, many are veterans on the industrial construction front. Many of the administrative cadres and technical personnel of the Shaoguan Iron and Steel Complex have participated in the construction of iron and steel bases such as Anshan, Taiyuan, Daye, Benxi, and Wuhan.

### 韶关——新的重工业基地在建设中

    韶关——新的重工业基地在建设中
    本报讯  一个新的重工业基地将出现在祖国的南方。这个基地，设在古之“南疆重镇”广东省北部的韶关市。现在，每天都有大批建设者奔向这个古老的城市，大建设的歌声惊醒了沉睡了几千年的山岳。到12月中旬，已经有韶关钢铁联合企业、华南重型机器厂、华南重型机床厂、韶关电缆厂、乌石火力发电厂五个限额以上的工程施工，还有另一个限额以上工程——韶关铜铝锌冶炼厂也将在年内施工。
    广东曾经被认为是矿藏不富、发展重工业前途不大的省份。近几年来经过专业队伍的勘探和群众报矿运动的展开，特别是经过几个月来全民大搞钢铁运动的实践，证实广东地下资源相当丰富，不仅有铁、有煤，还有油页岩和多种有色金属，特别是广东北部，资源更丰富。韶关在地理环境上接近全省较富的连阳、曲仁、南岭、罗家渡等煤矿和连平铁矿，又处水陆交通要道，是建设成为重工业基地的一个理想的地方。
    正在施工的韶关钢铁联合企业、华南重型机器厂、华南重型机床厂、韶关电缆厂以及即将施工的韶关铜铝锌冶炼厂，规模均居华南地区首位，在全国来说也是比较大的。韶关钢铁联合企业是一个以生产钢铁为主的综合性联合企业，它像全国其他较大的钢铁联合企业一样，拥有相当大的炼铁高炉和炼钢炉，企业下面还附属有氮肥、火力发电、耐火材料等几个较大的工厂。华南重型机器厂建成后可制出多种重型机器，年产量达三万吨。这个厂拥有加工大型机器零件所需的三千吨水压机设备，可以制造六百二十立方公尺容积的炼铁高炉、一百吨容量的炼钢平炉、九百公厘长八百公厘宽的轧钢机以及年产三十万吨煤的矿井等设备。华南独一无二的华南重型机床厂，规模同我国目前最大的武汉重型机床厂差不多，年产量达二万吨，可以制造十吨以上比较巨大和精密的重型机床，包括三点六公尺宽、十二公尺长的龙门刨床，五公尺直径的立式车床等。韶关电缆厂也是华南唯一的，每年可生产电力电缆和通讯电缆的铜铝导体各二万吨。韶关铜铝锌冶炼厂年产铜、铝、锌各六万吨。乌石火力发电厂可发电二十多万瓩，并将与流溪河、南水、新丰江、翁江、江西省上犹等水电站以及广州、茂名、阳春等火力发电厂联结在一起成为一个强大的输电网。
    根据规划，明年还将继续兴建年产一万吨的矿山机械厂、年产六万吨的钢丝绳厂、有五万纱锭的纺织厂、日产三千吨矿石的凡洞铜铝锌矿等比较大的厂矿；还要修筑韶关至赣州、韶关至汕头的铁路。
    从1959年第一季度开始到1960年这个期间，这些工厂陆续建成并投入生产后，这个重工业基地就可以基本建成。那时，韶关将以它的各种产品运销华南地区，逐步做到重型机器自给自足，大力装备各种机械制造、金属采掘和冶炼等工业，并加速实现电气化和建立完整的通讯网。这对于改变华南地区工业薄弱的面貌，提早实现工业化和农业机械化将起到重要的作用。
    现在，全国各地正大力支援这个重工业基地的建设。从四面八方前来韶关参加重点工程建设的职工共有两万人左右。在行政干部和技术人员、技工当中，有不少是工业建设战线上的老手。韶关钢铁联合企业的行政干部和技术人员，有不少参加过鞍山、太原、大冶、本溪、武汉等钢铁基地的建设。
