Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: In the high tide of the Cultural and Technological Revolutions, the broad masses of women have boldly displayed their spirit of daring to think and daring to act, diligently studying and delving deeply, rapidly conquering the mountain of culture and storming the secret halls of science. Among those who spoke at today's National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, there were many female heroes and model workers who have created miracles in the Cultural and Technological Revolutions.

The speech by Gao Yingxiu, a 73-year-old female learning model who was illiterate before liberation but can now write poetry and paint, was warmly welcomed by the representatives. Before liberation, she was a maidservant for landlords, and only began to learn to read after liberation. Over the past few years, she has studied diligently and assiduously, learning over two thousand characters, enabling her to read books and newspapers, keep accounts, write letters, and also paint more than sixty panel paintings and write many poems. This time, she came to Beijing to attend the conference and, seeing the vigorous development of the capital's construction, excitedly wrote a poem for Comrade Cai Chang. The poem is: "The General Line shines brightly, New China, a new atmosphere, molten iron flows for ten thousand miles, smashing the American imperialist wolves." Her outstanding academic achievements have been praised by the Deng County Party Committee and government in Henan Province, and the peasants affectionately call her "Old Age Red."

In the Cultural Revolution, many learning models like Gao Yingxiu have emerged among the broad masses of rural women. Many of them have become singers, poets, and painters. Huang Meiying, a peasant female writer, is an activist in the literacy campaign in Gansu Province. She was originally illiterate and only shed her illiteracy in 1957. Since then, she has actively engaged in creative writing. This year, she wrote a 16,000-character autobiographical novel and a more than 10,000-character novel praising the people's communes, as well as twenty-five poems. Lu Jinzhi, a sixteen-year-old poet, is a member of the Yuncheng County People's Commune Federation in Shanxi Province. Over the past year, she has written more than 120 poems. She participated in a peasant poetry competition at home, recited thirty-five of her own poems, and was awarded the "top scholar" title. Coming to Beijing to attend the conference, she wrote another sixteen poems. After her speech today, she recited her new works.

After conquering the mountain of culture, many housewives in various regions enthusiastically participated in theoretical study. Yang Fenglan, a housewife from Nankai District, Tianjin, reported on her achievements in studying philosophy at the conference. In the past, she sought gods and believed in ghosts. After studying philosophy, she learned that everything in the world is material and that seeking gods and believing in ghosts is idealism, and she stopped seeking gods. In her study of philosophy, she also understood the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people, as well as the different methods for dealing with these two types of contradictions. In the past, she sometimes quarreled with her neighbors, with neither side giving way. Now she realizes that this is a contradiction among the people, so she took the initiative to apologize to the neighbor she had quarreled with, and the two sides reconciled, strengthening unity.

"Science is not mysterious. As long as we have the communist spirit of daring to think and act, and ask a few more whys in ordinary things, comparing this way and that way, we can find the knack." These words spoken by Zheng Xinzhen, a representative from Guizhou Province, at the conference, show that the women among the working class and peasants of our country are advancing towards science and technology with a fearless spirit and a spirit of hard work and painstaking research.

Many women on the industrial, commercial, and medical fronts are equally daring to think and act, and have made contributions to technological innovation. Feng Ying, director of the laboratory of Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, overcame all difficulties and, together with the workers, successfully trial-produced eight-proof printed cloth that is resistant to concentrated acid, concentrated alkali, stains, water, shrinkage, mildew, and moths, and does not fade, making it a good material for making raincoats. After three days and three nights of hard work, she successfully tested a new technology for printing and dyeing—photoelectric facsimile direct engraving, transforming manual engraving into electrified and mechanized operation. Wang Guizhi, a laboratory technician at the Harbin Oil and Grease Chemical Factory in Heilongjiang, who only had six years of schooling, and Zhang Jiemin, a junior high school graduate who had just joined the factory, extracted six kinds of chemical raw materials from sunflower seed shells after more than thirty failures, without the guidance of engineers or technicians and without technical reference materials or refining and testing equipment. Later, they and the workers continued to extract nine kinds of chemical raw materials, which can increase the country's wealth by more than 7.4 million yuan each year. Jin Shuyi, an engineer at Guangdong People's Paper Mill, led workers to extract rayon from sugarcane residue. Mao Wenshu, a professor at Zhongshan Medical College in Guangdong Province, and her colleagues in the teaching and research group worked hard for twenty-five days and nights to complete 3,032 technological innovation projects, including twenty scientific papers, of which nine items, such as "Analysis of 30 Cases of Acupuncture Treatment for Eye Diseases" and "Statistics of 427 Cases of Causes of Blindness," reached international standards. Liu Lanying, a technician organized by Dalian Market Store in Liaoning Province, designed and created a price-calculating scale and a bristle-picking machine. Using the price-calculating scale to weigh goods can determine their price at the same time as their weight, improving sales efficiency and eliminating calculation errors.

At today's conference, sixteen other female activists from various fields reported on their achievements in their work. They are: Xu Zhengxiu, a revolutionary old mother from Hong'an County, Hubei Province; Hou Yi, a representative of the soldiers' drama troupe performing on the front lines of coastal defense; Zhou Shuiyue, a street worker from Shanghai who assisted the government in resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries; Li Yazhen, a representative of the Ministry of Communications who does whatever the Party calls for and does it well; Zou Xiuzhen, a housing administrator from Wuhan who has outstanding achievements in learning to be an "all-around housing administrator"; Li Rong, a sorter from the Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau whose manual mail sorting speed exceeds the machine speed and who has not had an accident for three months; Lan Yuzhen, the manager of the Huguosi Women's Store, one of the twenty-eight red flags in the Beijing Finance and Trade System; Wang Caiqin, a female train attendant representative from the Transportation Department of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in Liaoning Province, who has achieved success in safe and overloaded axle operation; Yang Yucui, the director of the Xiaozhang People's Commune in Luxi County, Hunan Province, who resolutely takes the socialist road; Li Yuexing, a representative of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, who made contributions in road construction; and Hong Xiucao, a representative of Fujian Province, who led the militia to fight alongside the People's Liberation Army and personally fired a gun to destroy a Chiang Kai-shek army vehicle. Gao Yongjun, a member of the Fengtian Production Team of the Jiejii People's Commune in Tailai County, Heilongjiang; Zheng Xinzhen from Shiping Township, Dafang County; Zhao Shuqiong, head of the epidemic prevention team of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Rong County, Sichuan; Wen Xiuzhen, a female commune member of the Chengguan People's Commune in Wanquan County, Hebei; and Peng Yingbei, a technician from the foundry workshop of Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The speech by Xu Zhengxiu, the seventy-three-year-old revolutionary old mother, deeply moved the audience. Her family had joined the revolution very early on. During the Great Revolution of 1927, she was doing women's work under the leadership of the Party. Her husband and three brothers from her mother's side were killed by the Kuomintang. She was also arrested, but she was unyielding and did not reveal a single piece of information about the Red Army to the enemy. After liberation, she actively took the lead in land reform and the cooperative movement, as well as in the development of agricultural production. At the age of seventy, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

    攻占文化山  闯进科学宫
    妇女积极分子在文化革命和技术革命中创造奇迹
    据新华社11日讯  广大妇女在文化革命和技术革命高潮中，大胆地发挥敢想敢干，苦学苦钻的精神，迅速攻下了文化大山，闯进了科学秘宫。今天全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议上发言的人中，就有很多是在文化革命和技术革命中创造了奇迹的女英雄、女模范。
    解放前一字不识，现在已能写诗作画的七十三岁的女学习模范高英秀在会上的发言，受到代表们极为热烈的欢迎。解放前，她给地主当女仆，解放后才学习文化。几年来，她苦学苦钻，认识了两千多字，能看书看报、记账写信，还画了六十多幅屏画和写了很多诗。这次她到北京开会，看到了首都建设事业的蓬勃发展，兴奋地写了一首诗送给蔡畅同志。这首诗是：“总路线、放光芒，新中国、新气象，铁汁奔、万里长，冲垮美帝豺狼”。她的出色的学习成绩，受到了河南省邓县党委和政府的表扬，农民们都亲热地称她为“老来红”。
    广大农村妇女在文化革命中，涌现出像高英秀这样的学习模范是非常多的。她们中还有很多人已成为歌手、诗人和画家。农民女作家黄梅英是甘肃省的扫盲积极分子，她原来一字不识，1957年才摘掉文盲帽子，以后她就积极地进行创作。今年，她写了一万六千字的自传性小说和一万多字的歌颂人民公社的小说，还写诗歌二十五首。十六岁的小诗人吕金枝是山西省运城县人民公社联社的社员，一年多来共写了一百二十多首诗歌。她在家里曾参加过一次农民赛诗会，朗读了自己写的三十五首诗歌，被评为“头名状元”。她到北京来参加大会，又作了十六首诗歌。今天发言后，朗读了她的新作。
    许多地区的家庭妇女在攻下文化大山以后，踊跃地参加理论学习。天津市南开区家庭妇女杨凤兰在会上报告了她学习哲学的成绩。她过去求神信鬼，学习了哲学后，知道了世界上一切东西都是物质的，求神信鬼是唯心论，从此再不求神了。她在学哲学中还懂得了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾以及这两类矛盾的不同的处理方法。她过去有时和邻居吵架，谁也不让谁，现在她认识到这是人民内部矛盾，就主动地向吵过架的邻居作了检讨，双方和好，加强了团结。
    “科学并不神秘，只要我们具有敢想敢做的共产主义风格，在平常的事物中，多问几个为什么，用这样比那样，又用那样比这样，就能找到窍门。”贵州省代表郑新珍在大会上说的这段话，显示着我国工农劳动群众中的妇女，正以大无畏的气魄和苦研苦钻的精神，向科学技术进军。
    工业、商业、医务等战线上的许多妇女同样敢想敢干，在技术革新上作出了贡献。上海第一印染厂化验室主任冯盈不畏一切困难，同职工们在一昼夜里试制成功了防浓酸、防浓碱、防污、防水、防缩、防霉、防蛀和不褪色的八防花布，是制造雨衣的好材料。经过三天三夜的努力，试验成功印染上的新技术——光电传真直接雕刻，把手工雕刻变为电气化机械化操作。只念过六年书的黑龙江哈尔滨油脂化工厂化验员王桂芝，同新来厂的初中毕业生张杰敏一道，在既没有工程师和技术人员指导，也没有技术参考资料和提炼、化验设备的情况下，经过三十多次失败，用葵花子壳提炼出六种化工原料，以后又和职工一起继续提炼出九种化工原料，今后每年可以为国家增加七百四十多万元财富。广东人民造纸厂工程师金淑仪，领导职工用甘蔗渣提炼出人造纤维。广东省中山医学院教授毛文书同她们教研组的同志一起苦战二十五昼夜，完成三千零三十二件技术革新项目，包括二十篇科学论文，其中“针灸治疗眼病三十例分析”、“四百二十七例盲目原因统计”等九项达到了国际水平。辽宁省大连市场商店组织技术员刘兰英，设计创造出金额秤和刷挑毛机，用金额秤称商品，在得出重量的同时能得出它的价钱，提高了售货效率，还不出算账差错。
    在今天大会上，还有十六位各行各业的妇女积极分子报告了她们工作中的成绩。她们是：湖北省红安县的革命老妈妈徐正修，深入海防前线演出的战士话剧团代表侯怡，协助政府与反革命分子作坚决斗争的上海市街道工作者周水月，党叫做什么就做什么而且做得很好的交通部代表李雅珍，学做“全能房屋管理员”有突出成绩的武汉市房屋管理员邹秀珍，手拣邮件速度超过机器速度而且三个月没有发生事故的哈尔滨邮电局分拣员李荣，北京财贸系统二十八面红旗之一的护国寺妇女商店的经理蓝玉珍，安全超轴行车有成绩的辽宁本溪钢铁公司运输部电务段女乘务员代表王彩琴，坚决走社会主义道路的湖南泸溪县小章人民公社社长杨玉翠，在筑路中建立功绩的吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州代表李月星，领导民兵与解放军并肩作战并亲手开炮击毁蒋军一辆汽车的福建省代表洪秀欉。黑龙江泰来县街基人民公社丰田生产队队员高勇军，大方县石坪乡郑新珍，四川荣县东风人民公社防疫组长赵淑琼，河北万全县城关人民公社女社员温秀珍，长春第一汽车制造厂铸工车间技术员彭映倍。七十三岁的革命老妈妈徐正修。在会上的发言使人深受感动。她一家人都很早就参加了革命，1927年大革命时期，她就在党的领导下做妇女工作，她的丈夫和娘家三个兄弟都被国民党杀害了，她也曾被抓去，但是她不屈不挠，不向敌人透露一句有关红军的情况。解放后在土地改革和合作化运动以及发展农业生产中，她都积极带头。在七十岁那年，她光荣地加入了中国共产党。
