    “European Payments Union” and “European Monetary Agreement”

    Many Western European countries participating in the "European Payments Union" have announced that their currencies can be freely converted to a limited extent. According to the decision of the Ministerial Council of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" in August 1955, if more than half of the member states participating in the "European Payments Union" announce that their currencies can be freely converted, the "Payments Union" will be dissolved, and these Western European countries will also simultaneously announce the end of the "European Payments Union" and begin implementing the "European Monetary Agreement" signed in August 1955.

    All seventeen member states of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" are participants in the "European Payments Union," they are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France , West Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, ​​Portugal, Sweden, ​​Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The United States and Canada participate in the meetings of the "European Payments Union" as "observers".

    In July 1950, the Council of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" passed an agreement deciding to establish the "European Payments Union," and in September 1950 the "Union" was proclaimed. This is a credit clearing institution for trade among these participating countries. The purpose of the agreement is: "To give the greatest possible freedom to trade between the contracting countries on an equal basis, and to promote the currency exchange of the member states and increase their foreign exchange and gold reserves." But in reality, this is not the case. The United States, through this multilateral clearing institution, uses US dollar loans to control the foreign trade and foreign exchange payments of these Western European countries, especially affecting the direction of these countries' foreign trade and restricting their economic exchanges with socialist countries. The management committee of the "European Payments Union" is composed of seven member states plus representatives of the US government and the chairman of the "European National Payments Committee" (also an institution of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation"). This "management committee" is responsible for supervising the implementation of the agreement, managing the credit fund, and making relevant recommendations to the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" for decision.

    The main activity of the "European Payments Union" is to regularly settle transactions between member states, and to statistically determine surpluses or deficits; the "Union" stipulates the limit of trade surplus or deficit for each member state based on the total trade volume of each member state with other member states in 1949. If there is a deficit, and within the limit, 75% needs to be paid to the other party in gold or US dollars, and the remaining 25% can be retained by the other party as a credit loan; if it exceeds the limit, the excess part must be paid in full in gold US dollars. If a member state has a surplus, and if it is within the limit, the "Union" will also pay gold US dollars and retain it as a credit loan in the ratio of 75% and 25%.

    The "revenue and expenditure" situation of the "European Payments Union" in recent years shows that some countries have been in debt for a long time, such as France, the United Kingdom and Italy; some countries have a considerable surplus, such as West Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. This "Payments Union" only truthfully reflects the unbalanced development and contradictions in the economies of Western European countries, especially in foreign trade.

    At the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" in January 1955, the issue of restoring the free convertibility of Western European currencies (including the pound sterling) was discussed. The meeting decided to draft the establishment of a "European Credit Fund Organization" to replace the "European Payments Union," and also decided that the capital figure of this "Fund Organization" would be 600 million US dollars. In August 1955, the seventeen member states participating in the "European Payments Union" signed the "European Monetary Agreement," preparing to provide a "European Credit Fund" of 600 million US dollars, and all member states became a multilateral clearing system, enabling participating countries to freely convert currencies. Of the 600 million US dollars in capital, the United States provides 270 million US dollars, and the remaining 330 million US dollars is provided by the participating countries. What Western European countries are preparing to implement now is this "Monetary Agreement". (West)

### “欧洲支付同盟”和“欧洲货币协定”

    “欧洲支付同盟”和“欧洲货币协定”
    参加“欧洲支付同盟”的许多西欧国家已经宣布它们的货币可以有限度自由兑换。根据1955年8月“欧洲经济合作局”部长理事会的决定，如果参加“欧洲支付同盟”的半数以上的成员国宣布它们的货币可以自由兑换的这个“支付同盟”即行解散，那么这些西欧国家也同时宣布结束“欧洲支付同盟”，开始实行于1955年8月签订的“欧洲货币协定”。
    参加“欧洲经济合作局”的十七个会员国都是“欧洲支付同盟”的参加者，它们是：奥地利、比利时、丹麦、法国、西德、希腊、冰岛、爱尔兰、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威、葡萄牙、瑞典、瑞士、英国和土耳其。美国和加拿大作为“观察员”参加“欧洲支付同盟”的会议。
    1950年7月，“欧洲经济合作局”理事会通过了一项协定，决定成立“欧洲支付同盟”，1950年9月这个“同盟”宣告成立。这是一个这些参加国的贸易上信贷清算机构，协定规定的目的是：“对于缔约国家间的贸易在平等的基础上予以最大限度的自由，并促进会员国的货币兑换，增加其外汇和黄金储备”。但是实际上并非如此，美国通过这个多边清算的机构，利用美元贷款来控制这些西欧国家的对外贸易和外汇支付，特别是影响了这些国家的对外贸易的方向，限制它们同社会主义国家进行经济往来。“欧洲支付同盟”的管理委员会，就是由七个会员国再加上美国政府代表和“欧洲国家支付委员会”（也是“欧洲经济合作局”的一个机构）的主席组成的。这个“管理委员会”负责监督协定执行情况，管理信贷基金，并作出有关建议交“欧洲经济合作局”决定。
    “欧洲支付同盟”的主要活动是定期进行会员国之间交易上的结算，统计出顺差或逆差；“同盟”根据1949年每一会员国同其他会员国的贸易总额为每一会员国分别规定了贸易上顺差或逆差的限额，如果有逆差，而且在限额之内，则75％需以黄金或美元偿付对方，余额25％可以保留下来，由对方作为信用贷款；如超过限额，则超出部分须全部用黄金美元偿付。一个会员国如果是顺差，如在限额之内，“同盟”也按75％和25％的比例偿付黄金美元和留作信用贷款。
    “欧洲支付同盟”几年来的“收支”情况表明，有些国家长期欠债很多，如法国、英国和意大利；有些国家则盈余不少，如西德、比利时和卢森堡等。这个“支付同盟”只是如实地反映了西欧国家在经济上特别是对外贸易上的不平衡的发展和矛盾情况而已。
    在1955年1月的“欧洲经济合作局”部长理事会会议上，曾经讨论过恢复西欧国家货币（包括英镑在内）自由兑换问题，会议决定草拟建立一个“欧洲信贷基金组织”来代替“欧洲支付同盟”，还决定这个“基金组织”的资本数字为六亿美元。1955年8月，参加“欧洲支付同盟”的十七个会员国签订了“欧洲货币协定”，准备提供一笔“欧洲信贷基金”六亿美元，所有会员国成为一个多边的清算体系，使各参加国能够自由兑换货币。在六亿美元的资本中，美国提供二亿七千万美元，其余三亿三千万美元由参加国提供。现在西欧国家准备实行的就是这个“货币协定”。  （西）
