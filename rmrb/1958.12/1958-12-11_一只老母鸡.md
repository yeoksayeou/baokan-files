    A Hen
    Li Chunfang
    Old Wang had a strange habit: he liked to keep his money in a pair of worn-out shoes, which he hid under the bed, unknown to anyone but himself. One day, he returned home from work to find his wife smiling at him. He quickly asked, "What makes you so happy?" His wife said, "Today, I'm treating you to a hen." "Eating a chicken, what's so special about that!" "It's special because it was bought with several pairs of old shoes." Before she could finish, he jumped up and down, his eyes staring, anxiously asking: "Why didn't you sell something else? There's something in those old shoes." His wife smiled, took out some RMB from her pocket:
  "It's good that you're saving money, but why don't you put it in the bank? If it weren't for my attentiveness, several dozen yuan would have gone into eating a hen!"

    一只老母鸡
    李春芳
    老王有个怪脾气，爱把钞票放在破鞋里，破鞋藏在床底下，除了自己谁也不晓的。有一天下班回家转，他爱人冲着他笑嘻嘻。忙问：“啥事使你这样乐？”爱人说：“今天请你吃只老
  母鸡。”“吃只鸡，啥稀奇！”“不稀奇，它是几双破鞋换
  来的。”他没听完就双脚跳，两眼发直心着急：“你为啥别的东西不去卖？我那破鞋里面有东西。”爱人一听抿嘴笑，从怀里掏出人民币：
  “你攒钱，是好的，为啥不存进银行里？如果不是我心细，几十元钱吃只老母鸡！”
