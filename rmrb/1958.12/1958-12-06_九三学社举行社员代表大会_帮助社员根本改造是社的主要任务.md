Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Second National Members' Representative Conference of the Jiu San Society was held in Beijing from November 28th to December 3rd.

    Zhou Peiyuan, a member of the presidium of the conference, delivered a work report on behalf of the previous Central Committee. The report reviewed the work since the First National Members' Representative Conference of the Jiu San Society in 1956, summarized the achievements and experiences of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and analyzed some of the manifestations of bourgeois intellectuals in the current situation. The report pointed out that, based on the domestic and international situation and the circumstances of the Jiu San Society, the main tasks of the Jiu San Society in the future should be: resolutely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, actively participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle, actively implement the general line of socialist construction, participate in the technological revolution, the cultural revolution, and the people's commune movement, and accelerate the fundamental transformation of the society and its members. When Zhou Peiyuan spoke about the fundamental transformation of the society, he pointed out: it is necessary to establish and implement a political line of truly accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and actively serving socialism, and transform the society from a bourgeois political party into a political party serving socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; establish a solid progressive leading force from the Central Committee of the society to the organizations at all levels, which accepts the leadership of the Communist Party, takes the socialist road, and maintains close ties with the masses, in order to undertake the new tasks of the society in the new situation.

    The representatives attending the conference adopted the methods of extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates to conduct in-depth discussions on the domestic and international situation and the tasks of the Jiu San Society, and made resolutions. The resolution pointed out that helping members carry out fundamental transformation, with the transformation of political stance as the foundation, while simultaneously carrying out ideological transformation, is the most fundamental task of the Jiu San Society. In order to achieve this task, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "taking politics as the commander, taking the work post as the base, and taking labor and practice as the foundation," especially to promote members to actively participate in physical labor, and through labor training, integrate with workers and peasants, learn from workers and peasants, and gradually achieve the laborization of intellectuals.

    The resolution sternly condemned the aggression of US imperialism against our country, and expressed that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it would promote all members and the masses they are connected with to actively participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. The resolution also called on members to resolutely be promoters of the people's commune movement.

    Tu Changwang, the secretary-general of the conference, delivered the closing speech on behalf of the presidium of the conference. He said that this was a historically significant conference for the Jiu San Society, a conference of ideological harvest, and a conference of great leap forward. Through the discussion of the current situation and tasks at this conference, everyone's thinking has been clarified, and great gains have been made. Tu Changwang finally said that our great motherland is moving from victory to victory with the momentum of thousands of horses galloping. The organizations at all levels and members of the Jiu San Society should accelerate the completion of self-transformation and the fundamental transformation of the society with unwavering determination, bring out soaring revolutionary drive, and work together with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party to strive to accelerate the socialist construction of our great country.

    The conference also elected Xu Deheng, Liang Xi and other ninety-one people as members of the Fifth Central Committee, and Li Xiaofang and other four people as alternate members of the Central Committee.

    帮助社员根本改造是社的主要任务
    新华社5日讯  九三学社第二届全国社员代表大会11月28日到12月3日在北京举行。
    大会主席团委员周培源代表上届中央委员会在会上作了社务报告。报告回顾了1956年九三学社第一届全国社员代表大会以来的工作，总结了整风运动和反右派斗争的成绩和经验，并且分析了资产阶级知识分子在当前形势下的一些表现。报告指出，根据国内外形势和九三学社的情况，九三学社今后的主要任务应该是：坚决在中国共产党的领导下，积极参加反帝爱国斗争，积极贯彻社会主义建设总路线，参加技术革命、文化革命和人民公社化运动，并且加速社和社员的根本改造。周培源在谈到社的根本改造时指出：必须确立和贯彻真正接受中国共产党的领导、积极为社会主义服务的政治路线，把社由资产阶级性的政党，改造成为在中国共产党领导下为社会主义服务的政党；从社中央到各级组织建立起巩固的接受共产党领导、走社会主义道路、密切联系群众的进步领导力量，以担负起社在新形势下的新任务。

    决议严厉地谴责了美帝国主义对我国的侵略，并且表示要在中国共产党的领导下，推动全体社员和所联系的群众，积极参加反帝爱国斗争。决议还号召社员坚决做人民公社化运动的促进派。
