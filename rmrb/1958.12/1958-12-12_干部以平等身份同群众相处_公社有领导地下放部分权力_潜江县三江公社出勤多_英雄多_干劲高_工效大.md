According to a report in the Hubei Daily: The Sanjiang People's Commune in Qianjiang County, through rectification, implemented the mass line and democratic management, greatly promoting winter production and the consolidation of the commune.

Some cadres in the Sanjiang People's Commune, after implementing organizational militarization, action combatization, and living collectivization, mistakenly believed that with these "threeizations," there was no need to consult with the masses on anything. As a result, the mass management and supervision of the commune's production, life, finance, labor, and other aspects were insufficient. Jiang Xiangxian, the captain of the Tongxing No. 8 team, concentrated all 378 laborers and 73 draft cattle under his unified command during the winter planting. He was so busy that he couldn't even eat properly, his voice was hoarse, and his legs were sore, while the twelve squad leaders were dissatisfied and said, "Militarization is good, we have no responsibility." The team's winter planting took four days and could not be completed on time.

The Sanjiang Commune Party Committee seriously analyzed and studied the above situation, and launched a rectification movement within and outside the Party, focusing on implementing the mass line. The main method was to use typical comparisons of the different results obtained with and without mobilizing the masses to make cadres realize that they must rely on the masses and follow the mass line. There was such a typical example: Huang Wenmei, the captain of the Qixin team, originally didn't consult with the masses and worked himself to death, with 49 people and 44 cattle only able to cultivate 46 mu of land a day. After changing his style, consulting with the masses, and letting the masses think of solutions, he established a deep plowing shock team, with only 37 people and 37 cattle, but cultivated 81 mu of land a day, even deeper than before. Huang Wenmei said, "More people do less work, fewer people do more work, following the mass line is really important." The entire commune originally lacked more than 120,000 jin of wheat seeds. Cadres asked for them from higher levels. After rectification and implementing the mass line, cadres turned their heads to look downward, mobilizing the masses to find solutions. In this way, the masses no longer complained about using too many seeds, and consciously took out seeds to ensure the plan. The missing seeds were all found. In particular, the Moshi Brigade, which originally looked upward and lacked 50,000 jin of wheat seeds, after looking downward and consulting with the masses, even transferred 30,000 jin of wheat seeds to support the winter planting of the Chengxi Brigade.

The Sanjiang Commune Party Committee also seriously summarized and analyzed the question of how to follow the mass line well. For several years, it has been emphasizing following the mass line. However, in actual work, it is often done well in one task but poorly in another; it is done well in one area but poorly in another. The Party Committee believes that whether or not one can follow the mass line well requires continuous accumulation of experience, but ultimately, it is a matter of thought, the cadre's mass viewpoint, and the cadre's willingness to interact with the broad masses of working people on an equal footing as ordinary laborers. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee put forward the task of "opening hearts to the masses and understanding the thoughts of the masses in everything" to all cadres. In addition to holding heart-to-heart meetings in various forms at the commune, brigade, team, and squad levels, they also established big-character poster groups in each team, set up suggestion boxes and suggestion books in each production team and canteen, and also established more than 400 opinion-gathering groups throughout the commune, striving to understand the thoughts of the masses in everything and do everything to the satisfaction of the masses. Whatever the masses suspected, the cadres explained to them. The masses in the Yangshi Brigade asked to know the financial situation after the establishment of the commune, and posted big-character posters saying that the commune's money was money in a mirror, visible but untouchable. The Party Committee accepted the opinions of the masses and successively held two accounting meetings of the production team, and each brigade selected a captain and a member representative to form a clearing group to publicly clear the accounts. As a result, the masses' doubts about financial work were dispelled, thereby promoting winter planting production.

The commune has many major affairs. In order to make this large family of more than 20,000 households act well with leadership and rhythm, responding from top to bottom in every matter, the Sanjiang Commune also mobilized the masses to formulate democratic management systems in production, life, labor, economy, finance, and other aspects; in particular, grasping the issue of power sharing between the commune and the teams, vigorously mobilizing the enthusiasm of lower-level cadres and the broad masses.

The commune implements the principles of centralized leadership, unified management, and hierarchical management in production; the power of financial and labor distribution is also divided at all levels and appropriately decentralized. At the same time, a responsibility system combining the collective and the individual is promoted. In terms of living management, all 691 public canteens in the commune have achieved the selection of one representative from every five households to form a canteen management committee, guide and supervise the work of the canteen, and regularly settle and publicize accounts.

Although the democratic management work of the Sanjiang People's Commune still needs to be further improved, many facts are enough to prove that democratic management is the fundamental guarantee for running the commune well and doing a good job in production. The Xinxing team of the Zhushi Brigade originally had 37 member households withdrawing from the public canteen. Later, they saw that the canteen established a management committee and a democratic management system of regular settlement and publication of accounts, and the cadres were open and honest and wholeheartedly served everyone, and they automatically returned to the canteen. They summarized this period as having three more and two high throughout the commune: high attendance, many heroes, and many satellites launched; high drive and high labor efficiency. Within half a month, the entire commune completed the harvesting of 22,213 mu of soybeans, the uprooting of 82,000 mu of cotton stalks, and the planting tasks of 146,000 mu. Fifty-eight "satellite" companies appeared, including 28 companies with an average of three to five mu of deep plowing (more than eight inches) per person per day, harvesting two and a half to three mu of soybeans, and picking 150 to 200 jin of cotton.

    干部以平等身份同群众相处
    公社有领导地下放部分权力
    潜江县三江公社出勤多  英雄多  干劲高  工效大
    据湖北日报消息  潜江县三江人民公社，用整风的方法，贯彻群众路线，实行管理民主化，大大促进了冬季生产和公社的巩固。
    三江人民公社有一些干部，在实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化以后，错误地认为有了这“三化”，一切事情就不需要和群众怎么商量了。结果，公社的生产、生活、财务、劳动等方面，群众性的管理和监督很不够。同兴八中队中队长蒋相贤，在冬播中，把全中队三百七十八个劳动力和七十三头耕牛集中一起统一指挥。他忙得连饭都吃不上，声哑腿痛，而十二个小队长都不满意地说：“军事化搞得好，没有我们的责任了。”全队冬播四天，迟迟不能完成。
    三江公社党委会认真分析研究了上述情况，从党内到党外，开展了以贯彻群众路线为内容的整风运动。主要方法是用发动群众与不发动群众得到不同结果的典型对比，使干部认识必须依靠群众，走群众路线。有这样一个典型：齐心中队长黄文美，原来没和群众商量，自己累死累活，四十九个人、四十四头牛一天只能耕四十六亩地。经过改变作风，和群众商量，让群众想办法，成立深耕突击组，只三十七人、三十七头牛，一天却耕了八十一亩地，比以前还耕的深。黄文美说：“人多办的事少，人少办的事多，走群众路线真是重要。”全公社原来缺小麦种十二万多斤，干部层层向上要，经过整风，贯彻群众路线，干部层层调头向下看，发动群众想办法。这样，群众再不埋怨用种多了，都自觉地拿出种子保规划，缺的种子都有了着落。特别是莫市大队，原来向上看，缺小麦种五万斤。向下看找群众商量后，还调出三万斤小麦种支援城西大队的冬播。
    三江公社党委会还认真总结分析了怎样走好群众路线的问题。几年来，一直在强调走群众路线。但是，在实际工作中，往往是在这一件工作上做好了，在那一件工作上可能又做差了；在这个地区做好了，在那个地区可能又做差了。党委会认为会不会走群众路线，虽然也需要不断积累经验，但归根结底，是一个思想问题，是干部的群众观点问题，是干部肯不肯以普通劳动者的身份去与广大劳动群众平等相处的作风问题。因此，公社党委会向全体干部提出了“向群众交心，事事了解群众的思想”的任务。他们除了在公社、大队、中队、小队以各种形式开好交心会外，在每个中队都建立了大字报组，在每个生产队和食堂，设置了意见箱、意见簿，并且在全公社还建立了四百多个吸收意见组，竭力作到事事了解群众思想，事事做得群众满意。群众怀疑什么，干部就向他们交代什么。杨市大队群众要求知道建立公社以后的财务情况，贴大字报说社的钱是镜里的钱，看得见摸不着。党委会接受群众意见，先后召开了两次生产队的会计会议，并且各大队抽出一个队长和社员代表组成清账小组，公开清理，结果，解除了群众在财务工作上的怀疑，从而推进了冬播生产。
    社大事多，要使两万多户的这大个家，在件件事情上有领导有节奏地上呼下应地行动得好，三江公社还发动群众制订了在生产、生活、劳动、经济、财务等方面的民主管理制度；特别是抓住社、队分权这个问题，有力地去调动下层干部和广大群众的积极性。
    公社在生产上实行集中领导、统一经营、分级管理的原则；财务、劳动支配权也层层划分了界限，适当下放。同时，推行集体和个人相结合的责任制度。在生活管理方面，全公社六百九十一个公共食堂，都已作到每五户社员选一个代表，成立食堂管理委员会，指导、监督食堂的工作，并定期结算公布账目。
    三江人民公社的管理民主化工作虽然还需要进一步完善，但许多事实已足以证明，民主管理是办好公社和搞好生产的根本保证。竹市大队新兴中队，原来有三十七户社员退出了公共食堂。后来他们看到食堂建立了管委会和定期结账公布的民主管理制度，干部开诚布公、一心一意地为大家服务，又自动地回到食堂里来了。他们总结了这一段全社有三多两高：出勤多，英雄多，放的卫星多；干劲高，工效高。半个月内，全社二万二千二百一十三亩的大豆的收割、八万二千多亩的棉花拔梗和十四万六千多亩的播种任务，都全部完成了。出现五十八个“卫星”连，其中有二十八个连，平均每人每天深耕（八寸以上）三亩到五亩田，割两亩半到三亩黄豆，摘棉花一百五十斤到二百斤。
