Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Union has become the world leader in the length of electrified railways, according to Rudoi, Minister of Transportation of the Soviet State Planning Committee, in an interview with TASS.

Rudoi said that the railway reconstruction speed stipulated by the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan will ensure that the electrified railway trunk line network expands by about threefold. The longest, highest volume of freight, and most technically advanced trans-Eurasian Moscow-Far East railway is being converted to electric traction. Plans are also underway to electrify the 1,700-kilometer Moscow-Mineral Waters (North Caucasus) railway and several other shorter railways.

Rudoi said that the fundamental technical transformation of various major transportation modes, especially railways, is the main feature of the draft Seven-Year Plan in transportation. The Soviet Union is preparing to realize electrification on a new and higher technical basis - changing from direct current to alternating current. In addition to great operational benefits, this can save 6% to 7% of road construction investment. By 1965, 85% to 87% of railway freight turnover will be transported by electric and diesel locomotives, a threefold increase compared to this year.

Speaking about the significance of railway electrification, Rudoi said that replacing steam traction with electric and diesel traction can greatly increase transport capacity, reduce transport costs, and save fuel. In the context of the imminent enormous development of the Soviet Union's productive forces, the strengthening of production links between regions, and the growth of foreign trade, the issue of increasing transport capacity is extremely important. Due to the extensive use of electric and diesel locomotives, transportation costs can be reduced by 22%, and the equivalent of 380 million tons of coal will be saved within seven years. The proportion of railways in total coal consumption will decrease from 19% to 4%, while the demand for electricity will correspondingly increase by 70%.

    七年计划实现铁路技术的根本改造
    苏联电气化铁路干线将扩大两倍
    新华社7日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联在电气化铁路长度方面已跃居世界第一位，这是苏联国家计划委员会运输部部长鲁多伊对塔斯社记者说的。
    鲁多伊说，七年计划控制数字规定的铁路改建速度将保证电气化铁路干线网扩大两倍左右。世界上最长、货运量最大、技术设备最完善的横跨欧亚两大洲的莫斯科—远东铁路干线正在改用电力牵引。还准备把长达一千七百公里的莫斯科—矿水城（北高加索）铁路和其他几条比较短的铁路改为电气化铁路。
    鲁多伊说，各种主要交通，特别是铁路的根本技术改造是运输方面七年计划草案的主要特点。苏联准备在新的更高的技术基础上实现电气化——把直流电改为交流电。这样做除了经营上有很大好处以外，还能把筑路的投资节省6％到7％。到1965年，铁路货物周转量中将要有85％到87％用电气机车和内燃机车来运输，即比今年增加两倍。
    鲁多伊在谈到铁路电气化的意义时说，把蒸气牵引换成电力和内燃机牵引可以大大地提高运输能力，降低运输成本和节省燃料。在苏联的生产力即将有巨大发展，各地区之间的生产联系将要加强，对外贸易将要增长的情况下，提高运输能力问题就显得非常重要。由于广泛利用电气机车和内燃机车，就可使运输成本降低22％，七年内将节省相当于三亿八千万吨煤的燃料。铁路在煤的总消费量中所占的比重将从19％降至4％，对电力的需要则将相应地增加了70％。
