Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 26th: 1958 has been a year of great achievements on the Romanian industrial front. The figures released here indicate that this year's total industrial output will be approximately three times higher than the highest pre-liberation production level in 1938.

    This year's industrial production plan is expected to be overfulfilled by about 3.5%, an increase of over 9.5% compared to 1957. As of December 23rd, oil drilling workers in Moldova and Pitesti regions have already surpassed their schedules. Eighty enterprises in Suceava and Galati regions, as well as most enterprises in Cluj and Oradea regions, have completed their annual plans. Employees of enterprises under the Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry have begun working on the 1959 plan since December 23rd.

    This year, the growth rate of Romania's steel and chemical industries has been very rapid, estimated to reach 19%. This year, Romania's steel production is expected to increase from 284,000 tons in 1938 to 950,000 tons, and pig iron production will increase from 133,000 tons to about 750,000 tons. During the era of the People's regime, Romania has built twenty metallurgical enterprise projects. This year, a number of new steel industry projects and equipment have been put into production nationwide. For example, not long ago, the largest steel complex in the country, the Hunedoara plant, completed a large automated rolling mill that can produce enough steel each year to manufacture 50,000 tractors and double the country's steel production. The output of the chemical industry this year will be seven times higher than in 1938. Many chemical industrial enterprises have overfulfilled their production tasks.

    This year, significant achievements have also been made in the production of other industrial sectors in Romania. Compared to 1938, this year's coal production will increase by 2.6 times, and natural gas will increase by 17 times.

    罗马尼亚工业战线上传捷报
    今年工业生产计划将超额完成
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电  1958年是罗马尼亚工业战线上取得良好成就的一年。这里公布的数字表明，今年的工业总产量将比解放前生产水平最高的1938年约多三倍。
    今年的工业生产计划将可以超额3.5％左右完成，比1957年增加9.5％以上。到12月23日为止，摩尔多瓦和彼特什蒂州的石油钻井工人已经赶到时间的前面。苏恰瓦州和加拉齐州八十个企业，以及克罗什州和俄拉第亚州的大多数企业都完成了年度计划。消费品工业部所属各企业的职工从12月23日起已开始作1959年的工作。
    今年罗马尼亚钢铁工业和化学工业生产的增长率十分快，估计可以达到19％。今年罗马尼亚的钢产量预计将从1938年的二十八万四千吨增加到九十五万吨，生铁产量将从十三万三千吨增加到七十五万吨左右。在人民政权年代中，罗马尼亚曾经建设了二十个冶金企业的工程项目。今年全国又有一批新的钢铁工业的工程项目和设备投入生产。例如，不久以前，全国最大的钢铁联合工厂——洪尼多阿拉工厂建成了一座自动化的大轧钢厂，它每年生产的钢材可以制造五万台拖拉机，并且可以使全国的钢材产量增加一倍。化学工业今年的产量将比1938年增加七倍。许多化学工业企业都超额完成了生产任务。
    今年罗马尼亚的其他工业部门的生产也取得了显著成就。同1938年相比，今年煤将增为二点六倍，天然瓦斯将增为十七倍。
