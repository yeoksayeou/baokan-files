Leap Forward Underground
By Our Correspondents Zhang Chao and Zhao Zhongxin

We entered the famous Datong Mining Area and immediately saw a high platform fluttering with colored flags. We went to take a look and found that it was the Mining Area's Leap Forward Platform. On it were portraits of male and female heroes, photographs, news of victory written in black ink on red paper, and red ink on white paper. From this dazzling Leap Forward Platform, you could feel their soaring enthusiasm in the depths of the earth.

Leading the way on the Leap Forward Platform was a tunneling team. This team created a record of 1,313 meters advanced in August, surpassing the tunneling expert Zhang Wanfu, and creating the highest national record. This team was led by Ma Liuhaizi, a nationally famous labor model in 1950. After Ma Liuhaizi became the chairman of the Datong Mining Area Trade Union, Zhao Fuqing took over. For eight years, this team has consistently been in the lead.

The next afternoon, we followed Zhao Fuqing into his tunneling roadway. This was a thin coal seam roadway, where you had to bend your back ninety degrees to walk in. It was truly a case of heads touching rock, feet treading in sewage, and moving with difficulty. The people at the tunneling face were kneeling to drill holes and set off explosives. The new records were created in this roadway! The workers, wiping the sweat from their foreheads, said, "No one believed it, but we still managed to leap forward!"

This spring, at the Leap Forward Conference held in the province, Zhao Fuqing proposed the following competition initiative to the coal tunneling workers of the entire province: Guaranteeing a monthly advance of 1,000 meters, an annual advance of 10,000 meters, and digging twenty *li* of roadways in hard coal seams within the year. After the proposal was published, workers throughout the mine had different opinions. Some said, "Last year, with such good coal seams, we only advanced a few hundred meters per month. This year, tunneling through thin coal seams, how can we advance 1,000 meters? You're deliberately trying to embarrass the Datong Mine." Some people even wrote a doggerel about Zhao Fuqing's team: "Zhao Fuqing's team has an empty name, their big talk is terrifying." But Zhao Fuqing's team had a different view from everyone else. They believed that what you can get to by simply stretching your legs doesn't count as being advanced, and the greater the difficulties overcome, the greater the achievements. Zhao Fuqing's team quietly held a meeting, where everyone said, "We will not give up until we achieve our goal!" From then on, the team members got together whenever they had time to find problems in their work and find solutions. The problems were quickly identified: first, the coal cars were large and the roadways were small, making it difficult to turn around, resulting in a lot of wasted time. Old workers Jia Zhengjun and Lian Shanhuzi helped Zhao Fuqing come up with solutions: modify the cars and adopt multi-head tunneling. Once these two major measures were adopted, the people who were picking at the coal seam roof were freed up to do tunneling, and the coal cars were also supplied. The team also adopted new working methods: don't go out of the mine empty-handed, bring a coal car; don't come into the mine empty-handed, carry pit props and rails. Each type of work was coordinated tightly, without wasting a second. In this way, they achieved the proposed target in the first month. This caused a sensation throughout the entire Datong Mining Area. A competition movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced quickly unfolded in the entire mining area. However, Zhao Fuqing's team always stood at the highest peak of tunneling. After more than half a year of competition, the situation in the Datong Mining Area where tunneling couldn't keep up with coal mining was reversed. By the end of August, tunneling had prepared two years of roadways for coal mining. "The Second Mine fired the first shot!" The workers of the Datong Mining Area ran around spreading the news. When we arrived at this hydraulic coal mining area, the knee-deep water flowing underground in the roadway was already washing the mined coal blocks towards the coal bunker. Wang Sanxiao, who was holding the water jet tightly, finished mining a seam of coal and stopped to say, "The water gun is a new toy. Don't look at the nozzle being only as thick as a little finger, it shoots out water with a pressure of two hundred horsepower, it's very powerful!" Team Leader Gong Fu said, "Using water guns to mine coal is the latest technology for coal mining, and it is very beneficial for reducing the physical labor of workers, but it is not easy to install one. In normal times, it wouldn't be possible to install one in a year, this time it really came out of the Leap Forward."

"Coal mines are changing every year, but no change is as big as this year. Sixty-year-olds are rejuvenated today, their enthusiasm soaring, surpassing the prime of youth." The miners are very happy to see the leaping progress of the coal mine this year, so they composed a doggerel to praise the Datong Coal Mine for its forty years of construction. In the past, most of the mining was done by hand, and the efficiency was very low. After 1937, under the rule of Japanese imperialism, the mines were dug in a crooked manner. After liberation, production was gradually restored. In 1953, powerful machines such as coal combines, coal cutters, and belt conveyors were used to equip the mine, changing the dilapidated appearance of the coal mine. However, the machines were not used well, the production efficiency was very low, and the coal output could not be increased. This year, this mine has changed fundamentally. All the machines have been started, and the workers have also lengthened the cutter heads of the coal combines and coal cutters, increasing the efficiency by one to two times. This year's output has doubled compared to last year. The main factor is the change in people. In the past, the workers here were always lacking in confidence. When a new target or a new experiment was proposed, they were always afraid that they couldn't complete it. Now, everyone wants to rush ahead. They are comparing themselves with the national advanced and with the world advanced. They will not be content unless they catch up with the past. The Datong Mine is not very suitable for hydraulic coal mining. Originally, the Provincial Coal Management Bureau only decided to have the Datong Mine try one this year, but they insisted that the difficulties could be overcome, so they did it on a large scale. The Coal Mine adopted cyclical operations. The Ministry of Coal stipulated that only one cycle could be mined per day, but the workers of the Sixth Mine, after research, found that mining one more cycle would produce twice as much coal, so they mined five cycles a day. When various mines were engaged in hydraulic coal mining on a large scale, the workers of the Fourth Mine said, "We must find a method that is even more advanced than hydraulic coal mining!" So they successfully experimented with underground gasification, turning the coal into gas and extracting it up the well. When we left the Datong Mine, we heard that the workers had created a way to drive cars down the well to transport coal. Workers, create boldly, we hope to hear soon that you have created a way for the coal to climb up the well by itself!

    跃进在井下
    本报记者  张超  赵忠信
    我们进入著名的大同矿区，一眼就看到一个飘拂着彩旗的高台，我们前去一看，原来是矿区的跃进台。上面有男、女英雄的画像、照片、红纸黑字、白纸红字的捷报。从这个琳琅满目的跃进台上，就能使你感到他们在地底下的冲天干劲。
    在跃进台上领先的是一个掘进小组。这个小组在8月份创造了月进一千三百一十三公尺，超过了掘进能手张万福，创造了全国最高纪录。这个小组在1950年是全国著名的劳动模范马六孩领导的，马六孩当了大同矿区工会主席，赵福清接了班，八年来，这个小组一直领先。
    第二天下午，我们跟赵福清进入他的掘进巷道。这是薄煤层巷道，要把腰弯到九十度才能走进去，真是头顶岩、脚踏污水、移步艰难。赵福清一手拖着坑木，一手拖着铁轨，像鸵鸟似的大步往里奔，掘进工作面的人，打眼、放炮都是跪着干的。新纪录都是在这个巷道里创造的！工人们擦着头上的汗水说：“谁也不相信，我们到底还是跃上来啦！”
    今年春天，赵福清在全省召开的跃进大会上，向全省煤掘进工人提出这样的竞赛倡议：保证月进千公尺，年进万公尺，年内在坚硬的煤层里打出二十华里的巷道。倡议书发表后，全矿工人众口纷纭，有的说：“去年那么好的煤层才月进几百公尺，今年掘进薄煤层，怎能进千公尺，成心要给大同矿丢人。”有的人给赵福清小组编了顺口溜：赵福清小组空有名，大话说得吓死人。但是赵福清小组的人和大家有个不同的看法，他们认为伸腿就到的算不了上游，凡是克服困难越大的成绩就越大。赵福清小组，悄悄地开了会，会上每个人都表示：“不达目的不罢休！”从此，小组的人有空就在一起找工作中的问题，找解决办法。问题很快找出来了：一是运煤车皮大，巷道小，转不开，窝工大。老工人贾正君和连山虎帮助赵福清想出了解决办法：改车皮、采用多头掘进。两大措施一采用，挑煤层顶的人腾出来掘进了，运煤车也供应上了。小组也采用了新的工作方法：出井不空手，带煤车；进井手不空，扛坑木、铁轨。各个工种配合的严实合缝，不漏走一秒钟工夫。这样，第一个月，就实现了倡议指标。这一下轰动了大同全矿区。一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛运动，很快在全矿区展开了。可是赵福清小组一直站在掘进的最高峰。经过半年多的竞赛，大同矿区掘进赶不上采煤的局势翻了一个转，到8月底，掘进已为采煤准备下了两年巷道。“二矿打响了第一枪啦！”大同矿区的工人奔走相告着这个消息。我们来到这个水力采煤区时，巷道地下没膝的水流，已把打下的煤块冲向煤仓。紧握水柱的王三小打了一道煤，停下来说：“水枪，是新玩艺。你不要看那枪口只有小指头粗，打出的是有二百马力压力的水，力量大得很！”区队长龚福说：“用水枪打煤，是采煤的最新技术，对减轻工人体力劳动有很大好处，可是安装一台不容易。要在平时，一年也安不起来，这回真是跃进出来的。”
    “煤矿年年在变化，变化没有今年大。六十老年今还童，干劲冲天赛壮年。”矿工们见到今年煤矿飞跃的进步，十分喜悦，他们就自编顺口溜来歌颂大同煤矿建矿四十年。过去大都是手工采掘，效率很低。1937年以后，为日本帝国主义统治，矿井被挖的东斜西歪。解放以后，逐渐恢复生产，1953年，开始用采煤康拜因、截煤机、皮带运煤机等强大的机器，进行了武装，改变了煤矿的破烂面貌。但是机器用的不好，生产效率很低，煤产量一直提不上去。今年，这个矿从根本上变了样。机器全部开动起来了，工人们还把采煤康拜因、截煤机的截盘加长了，效率普遍提高一倍到两倍。今年产量比去年翻一番。主要因素是人的变化。过去这里的工人老是信心不足，提出一个新的指标，或是新的试验，老怕完不成实现不了。现在呢，一切都想往前头抢。和全国先进的比，和世界上先进的比。不赶过去就不甘心。大同矿不太适合水力采煤，原来省煤管局今年只确定大同矿搞一个试试，但他们偏说困难可以克服，就大搞了起来。煤矿采用循环作业，煤炭部规定一天只能采一个循环，可是大同六矿的工人们研究后，多采一个循环能多出一倍的煤，就一天采到五个循环。当各矿大搞水力采煤的时候，四矿工人说：“我们非找出一个比水力采煤还要先进的办法！于是他们就试验成功了井下汽化。把煤变成汽体抽上井来。我们离开大同矿的时候，又听说工人们创造了把汽车开下井运煤的办法。工人们，你们大胆创造吧，我们希望不久能听到你们创造出一种让煤自己爬上井的办法来！
