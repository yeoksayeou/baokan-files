	Daily Progress
	To all Young Pioneers attending the National Congress of Youth Activists
	Salute, dear Chairman Mao!
	Salute, dear Party!
	We ride the east wind, face the sun,
	Happily, mightily,
	From all corners of the motherland,
	We come to Chairman Mao's side.
	To report to Chairman Mao,
	To ask after Chairman Mao's health.
	To let Chairman Mao see if
	Our knowledge has grown? Are our bodies strong?
	Are we obedient? Are we presentable?
	We learn from the elder brothers and sisters attending the conference,
	Learning your revolutionary drive,
	Lofty ideals,
	Collective wisdom,
	Heroic courage.
	We are always ready:
	To struggle for the cause of communism,
	We will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings:
	-- Study hard!
	Make progress every day!
	Make progress every day!
	Make progress every day!
	In the struggle to build socialism,
	We make progress every day!
	Following our fathers and brothers,
	Learning from the example of revolutionary predecessors,
	Tempering ourselves in labor,
	Growing in struggle.
	What the Party says to do,
	We resolutely do;
	What the Party says should be,
	We will certainly be!
	The Party calls: Be good students!
	We must study hard and diligently,
	Learn all subjects well,
	Understand every exercise thoroughly,
	Do our homework carefully,
	Listen attentively in class.
	Loving our classmates, we care for each other and help each other,
	Respecting our teachers, just like respecting our own fathers and brothers.
	Learn science, learn culture.
	Construction needs knowledge,
	Just like battles need guns.
	While worker uncles fight for every second in front of the lathe,
	We must also cherish every second in the classroom.
	Lay a solid foundation today,
	Bravely ascend the peak of science tomorrow.
	The Party calls: Plant saplings,
	Quickly dress the barren mountains in green robes!
	Young Pioneers across the country act together, carrying saplings up the mountainside
	Planting ten thousand acres of Young Pioneer forests by the side of Poyang Lake,
	Planting an 8,000-li Young Pioneer tree-lined road along the Heilongjiang River.
	Turn the beaches into oases,
	Create forests even on the seabed.
	Diligently catch insects, diligently weed,
	People grow up, trees grow tall,
	All become good materials for building communism!
	The Party calls: A great leap forward in agricultural production!
	We pick up wheat ears, gather cotton,
	Every grain of food goes into the granary,
	Every cotton boll is brought home.
	A basket of grass, a basket of manure,
	Fertilize the yellow cattle and strengthen the horses,
	Manure piles are higher than mountains.
	Small reservoirs, small ponds,
	Support agricultural water conservancy.
	Plant crops in small farms,
	Launch leap forward flowers in experimental fields.
	Let's first talk about our cucumber king,
	Guess how big it is?
	One cucumber is three chi and nine cun long,
	You couldn't eat it even with a huge belly.
	Wheat can grow full heads of grain,
	Garlic heads are bigger than fists.
	It's even more interesting to talk about grafting,
	Two neighbors become one family,
	Growing Jerusalem artichokes at the foot, sunflowers blooming at the top.
	Named "Two-Story Building,"
	Harvesting upstairs and downstairs.
	Shandong has an Iron Ox Team,
	Producing 18,000 jin of corn per mu,
	The Iron Ox's sweet potato grows so big,
	One sweet potato needs a cart to pull.
	Three young girls from Anhui,
	Plant cotton on saline-alkali land,
	Without technology, learn technology,
	Overcome difficulties and find solutions.
	With a double-thousand jin of cotton in hand,
	The young girls make new plans:
	Wheat also wants to launch a satellite,
	Don't you think their ambition is great?
	The Party calls: Surpass England!
	Mobilize the whole people to run industry.
	Our small factories,
	Are more numerous than the stars in the sky.
	It's really joyful to be a small worker,
	Pick up small tools, sing labor songs.
	Remold ourselves into new people,
	Dedicate our products to the motherland.
	Flower straw hats, small leather boots,
	Waste paper made into schoolbags, beets made into candy,
	Wax fruits are so bright,
	Porcelain kittens are so lively,
	Pig bristle brushes are well made,
	The export company comes to order,
	Apricot kernels made into activated carbon,
	The quality far exceeds West Germany.
	The Party calls: Great Steel Smelting!
	The whole people go to the battlefield.
	Children and youth follow closely,
	Schools become small steel plants.
	Luanchuan Young Pioneers' furnace, the method is strong,
	Building a furnace without spending a penny,
	Using a bamboo tube as a bellows.
	Luoyang Young Pioneers do a good job,
	Young Pioneers run a steel factory.
	It is a school, it is a workshop,
	It is a workshop, it is a classroom.
	Young Pioneers organize a "Sand Washing Team,"
	Iron sand piled up like a mountain,
	Young Pioneers pick up scrap iron,
	Scrap iron is smelted into Young Pioneer steel.
	Young Pioneer steel, Young Pioneer steel,
	People smelt steel, steel tempers people,
	Tempering into high-quality steel from a young age!
	The Party calls: Good children,
	Be revolutionary little vanguards!
	In the past, Children's Corps stood guard, kept watch, checked passes,
	Today, Young Pioneers also have little telephone soldiers.
	Helping PLA uncles boil tea, boil water, wash clothes,
	Still little quartermasters.
	Eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene,
	Young Pioneers have the ability.
	Establish hygiene posts everywhere,
	Frequent outings in the streets and alleys,
	One hand holding a fly swatter,
	One hand holding a megaphone,
	Starting and leaving the post according to orders,
	Staying in the post without relaxing.
	When persuading people, have a good attitude,
	When shouting, be melodious,
	Working for society is our duty,
	Serving the people is our glory.
	Help little brothers and little sisters,
	Let them eat clean and play happily.
	Respect grandpa and grandma,
	Let the elderly be happy and peaceful.
	No matter where we are,
	We must be revolutionary little vanguards.
	Long live, dear Chairman Mao!
	Long live, dear Party!
	We will be good sons and daughters of the Party,
	Always follow Chairman Mao's instructions:
	-- Study hard!
	Make progress every day!
	Be a successor to the cause of communism!
	Build the human world into a communist paradise!

专栏：一代新人

    天天向上
    出席全国青年积极分子大会的全体少先队员
    敬礼，亲爱的毛主席！
    敬礼，亲爱的党！
    我们乘着东风，迎着太阳，
    高高兴兴，浩浩荡荡，
    从祖国的四面八方，
    来到毛主席身旁。
    向毛主席报告，
    问毛主席健康。
    让毛主席看看我们
    学问长没长？身体壮不壮？
    听话不听话？像样不像样？
    向参加大会的哥哥、姐姐学习，
    学习你们革命的干劲，
    远大的理想，
    集体的智慧，
    英雄的胆量。
    我们时刻准备着：
    为共产主义事业而奋斗，
    我们永远记着毛主席的教导：
    ——好好学习！
    天天向上！
    天天向上！
    天天向上！
    在建设社会主义的斗争中，
    我们天天向上！
    跟随我们的父兄，
    学习革命先辈的榜样，
    在劳动中锻炼，
    在斗争中成长。
    党说做什么，
    我们坚决做什么；
    党说应该怎么样，
    我们一定怎么样！
    党号召：做个好学生！
    我们要好好学习多用功，
    各门功课都学好，
    每道习题都弄通，
    作业认真做，
    上课专心听。
    热爱同学，我们互相关心互相帮助，
    尊敬老师，就像尊敬自己的父兄。
    学科学，学文化。
    建设需要知识，
    就像战斗需要枪。
    工人叔叔在车床前分秒必争，
    我们在课堂上也要爱惜分秒时光。
    今天打好稳固的基础，
    明天勇敢地登上科学的高峰。
    党号召：种树苗，
    快给荒山穿绿袍！
    全国少年齐动手扛起树苗上山腰鄱阳湖畔种下万亩少年林，
    黑龙江边栽成一条八千里路的少年林荫道。
    要把沙滩变绿洲，
    海底也能把林造。
    勤捉虫，勤锄草，
    人长大，树长高
    都当建设共产主义的好材料！
    党号召：农业生产大跃进！
    我们就拣麦穗，拾棉花，
    粮食颗粒都归仓，
    棉花朵朵收回家。
    一篮草，一筐粪，
    喂肥黄牛养壮马，
    粪堆高高比山大。
    小水库，小水塘，
    支援农业水利化。
    小农场里种庄稼
    试验田里也开跃进花。
    先说咱的黄瓜王，
    你猜个儿有多大？
    一根黄瓜三尺九，
    天大的肚子你也吃不下。
    小麦能长满头穗，
    蒜头倒比拳头大。
    提起嫁接更有趣，
    两家邻居成一家，
    脚下长洋姜，头上开葵花。
    起名叫做“两层楼”，
    收了楼上收楼下。
    山东有个铁牛队，
    亩产玉米一万八，
    铁牛的地瓜长得大，
    一颗地瓜用车拉。
    安徽三个小姑娘，
    盐碱地上种棉花，
    没有技术学技术，
    克服困难想办法。
    双千斤棉花拿到手，
    小姑娘又订新计划：
    小麦也要放卫星，
    你看志气大不大？
    党号召：超英国！
    发动全民办工业。
    我们办的小工厂，
    比那天上的星星还要多。
    做个小工人，心中真快乐，
    拿起小工具，唱起劳动歌。
    把自己锻炼成新人，
    把产品献给祖国。
    花草帽，小皮靴，
    废纸做书包，甜菜做糖果，
    蜡做的水果真鲜艳，
    瓷做的小猫真活泼，
    猪鬃毛刷做得好，
    出口公司来订货，
    杏核做成活性炭，
    质量远远超西德。
    党号召：大炼钢！
    全国人民上战场。
    少年儿童紧跟上，
    学校变成小钢厂。
    栾川少年炉，办法想得强，
    建炉不花一文钱，
    一根竹筒当风箱。
    洛阳少年干得好，
    红领巾办起钢铁厂。
    是学校，是工场，
    是车间，是课堂。
    红领巾组织起“淘砂团”，
    铁砂堆成山一样，
    少先队员拣废铁，
    废铁炼成少年钢。
    少年钢，少年钢，
    人炼钢铁钢炼人，
    自小炼成优质钢！
    党号召：好儿童，
    要当革命小尖兵！
    当年，儿童团站岗、放哨、查路条，
    今天，少先队也有小小电话兵。
    帮助解放军叔叔煮茶、烧水、洗衣服，
    还是小小勤务兵。
    除四害，讲卫生，
    少先队员有本领。
    到处建立卫生岗，
    大街小巷常出动，
    一手拿着苍蝇拍，
    一手拿着喊话筒，
    出岗收岗遵命令，
    坚持岗位不放松。
    劝人时，态度好，
    喊话时，要动听，
    为社会工作是我们的职责，
    为人民服务是我们的光荣。
    帮助小弟弟小妹妹，
    让他们吃得干净，玩得高兴。
    尊敬老爷爷，老奶奶，
    让老人家欢欢喜喜安安宁宁。
    无论在什么地方，
    我们都要做革命的小尖兵。
    万岁，亲爱的毛主席！
    万岁，亲爱的党！
    我们要做党的好儿女，
    永远听从毛主席的嘱咐：
    ——好好学习！
    天天向上！
    作一个共产主义的接班人！
    把人间建设成共产主义的天堂！
