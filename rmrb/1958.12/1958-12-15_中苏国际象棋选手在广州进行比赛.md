    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 13th: The first exhibition match of the Soviet chess players' visit to China was held in the Guangzhou Cultural Park Concert Hall on the evening of the 12th and the morning of the 13th.
    The three Soviet chess players, V. Baranov, M. Moshkinov, and A. Grushevsky, appeared simultaneously yesterday. Their opponents were Xu Jialiang, Xu Hongshun, and Xian Quan, the top three winners of this year's national chess championships. As a result of the competition, all of our players failed due to lower technical skills. Soviet chess players achieved a complete victory in their first match during their visit to China.
    These three Soviet chess players are visiting China for exhibition matches at the invitation of our National Sports Commission. In addition to this exhibition match in Guangzhou, they will also visit and compete in Shanghai, Hohhot, and Beijing, and introduce the advanced experience of Soviet chess to our chess players.

    据新华社广州13日电  苏联国际象棋运动员访问我国的第一场表演赛，12日晚和13日上午在广州文化公园音乐厅举行。
    苏联的三位国际象棋运动员，昨日同时出场。他们是维·巴朗诺夫、马·莫希金诺夫、阿·格鲁舍夫斯基。分别和他们对棋的是我国今年全国棋类锦标赛国际象棋前三名优胜者徐家亮、许宏顺和冼权。比赛结果，我国选手都因技术低一筹而失败。苏联象棋运动员在访问我国的第一场比赛中获得全胜。
    这三位苏联国际象棋运动员是应我国家体委邀请来我国进行访问比赛的。他们除了在广州作这一场访问比赛外，还要到上海、呼和浩特和北京等地访问比赛，并向我国国际象棋运动员介绍苏联国际象棋的先进经验。
