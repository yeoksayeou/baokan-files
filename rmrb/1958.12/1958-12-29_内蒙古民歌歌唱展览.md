Inner Mongolia Folk Song Singing Exhibition

    Lao She

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Million Folk Song Singing Exhibition came to Beijing. This exhibition method is very novel: after introducing and explaining each type of exhibit, it is immediately followed by a performance by singers. It allows us to see the creative achievements of the masses and hear how those works should be sung and recited. Some programs also include singing and dancing. From the works themselves, we can see the life of the people of Inner Mongolia during the Great Leap Forward; through singing and recitation, we can also see the actual situation of their literary and artistic activities and the richness and diversity of literary and artistic forms. In this way, seeing the exhibition is like taking a trip to Inner Mongolia, witnessing firsthand how people of all ethnic groups live together like brothers, tilling land, building canals, smelting steel, and herding livestock, and hearing and seeing their songs and dances during labor and rest, which is very intimate and moving.

    I feel that this exhibition, which combines works with performances, is dominated by a kind of enthusiasm, making people feel reluctant to leave after seeing it. Yes, look at those works, except for a few traditional folk songs, almost all are closely related to production. Reading the words on paper, our hearts are warmed, as if we could immediately hold the hands of those thousands of authors. Yes, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, like people all over the country, are elated, full of energy, and doing their best to make achievements in the Great Leap Forward. Their enthusiasm for building socialism overflows onto the paper, not diminished by the region's severe cold and drought. After reading what's on paper, and then listening to the workers, farmers, and herdsmen sing, or even sing and dance, we are immediately moved by the enthusiasm of the performers. How well they sing! Yes, the people of Inner Mongolia have always been good at singing and dancing. How earnestly they sing and dance, which not only shows their tradition and talent for singing and dancing, but also shows how much they value, how responsible they are for, and how enthusiastic they are about this exhibition. They are not just here to perform, but also to undertake the important responsibility of promoting mass creation, carrying out cultural revolution, and praising labor production and socialism through the exhibition. Yes, before coming to Beijing, they had already exhibited in various parts of Inner Mongolia for a month! How I love these singers! They brought the revolutionary spirit of the people of Inner Mongolia to Beijing, singing it out to their heart's content, inspiring us, moving us!

    As soon as I hear them sing, I seem to see the heroic people of all ethnic groups, and the vast and majestic scenery with wind, cold, and heavy snow. They sing loudly into the clouds, with the spirit of looking up to the sky. They are people who are used to galloping on the grasslands, doing the work of opening up mountains and clearing the land, and will never create decadent music. Some folk songs are sung in the languages of fraternal ethnic groups, and although I don't understand them, I still love to listen. I can hear their enthusiasm. After listening to a song and a poem, I understand them better and love them more. Although the languages are different, our hearts are the same! Brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups are all close brothers in the socialist family! When everyone sings together, I can't wait to run over and hug them all! How beautiful it is that brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups love each other so much and sing in unison about the same ideal!

    I love this exhibition, I love those singers, musicians, and workers! I think this exhibition is a success!

    How to evaluate folk songs, how to improve folk singers, how to collect and select traditional folk songs, and how to sing and recite new folk songs, etc., still need careful study before gradually drawing conclusions. Therefore, I will not mention these issues in this short article. However, this lively and vivid exhibition, which combines seeing and hearing, will be of some help in studying those issues, there is no doubt about that.

    内蒙古民歌歌唱展览    
    老舍
    内蒙古自治区百万民歌歌唱展览会来京展览。这种展览方法很新鲜：每介绍、解说一类展览品之后，即由歌手表演。它叫我们既看到群众的创作成绩，又听到那些作品该怎么歌唱与朗诵。有的节目还载歌载舞。从作品的本身里，我们可以看到内蒙古人民在全民大跃进中的生活面貌；通过歌唱与朗诵，我们又看到他们的文艺活动的实况与文艺形式的丰富多采。这样，看了展览会就仿佛到内蒙古走了一趟，亲眼看见各族人民怎样如兄如弟地在一起翻地修渠，炼钢牧畜，并且听到看到了他们在劳动与休息中的歌声舞态，亲切动人。
    我觉得这次的作品结合表演的展览是叫一种热情支配着，令人看过之后还依依难舍，不忍离开。是的，看那些作品吧，除了一部分传统民歌，几乎都是密切与生产结合的。读了纸上的字句，我们的心就热起来，好像马上能拉住那成千上万的作者的手才好。是，内蒙古各族人民和全国各处的人民一样，都兴高采烈，干劲冲天，在大跃进中各尽所能地作出成绩。他们的建设社会主义的热情洋溢在纸上，不因地区严寒荒旱而有逊色。看完了纸上的，再一听工、农、牧民那么一唱，或且唱且舞，我们就立刻又被表演者的热情所感动。他们多么会唱啊。是呀，内蒙古人民原是能歌善舞的。他们唱的舞的多么认真哪，这可就不只表现了他们向来就有能歌善舞的传统与才华，而且表现了他们对这一展览多么重视，多么负责，多么热情。他们不只是来表演一下，而是负起借着展览来推动群众创作，闹文化革命，歌颂劳动生产与社会主义等等的重大责任。是的，他们在来京以前，已经在内蒙古各地展览了一个月！我多么爱这些歌手啊！他们把内蒙古人民的革命干劲带到了北京，尽情地歌唱出来，鼓舞了我们，感动了我们！
    一听到他们唱啊，我仿佛就看见了各族的英勇人民，与风寒雪重的苍茫雄伟的景色。他们高唱入云，有昂首天外的气概。他们是在草原广野驰骋惯了的人，作了开山辟地的事，决不作靡靡之音。一部分民歌是用兄弟民族语言演唱的，尽管我不懂，可还是爱听。我听得出他们的热情。听罢一曲一诗，我就更了解他们，更爱他们。语言不同，心可是一样啊！兄弟民族在社会主义的大家庭里就都是亲兄弟啊！及至大家合唱的时候，我恨不能跑过去一一拥抱他们！各民族的兄弟姊妹这样相亲相爱，齐声歌赞同一理想，有多么美丽呀！
    我爱这个展览，爱那些位歌手、乐师与工作者！我认为这个展览是成功的！
    对于民歌的如何估价，民间歌手的如何提高，传统民歌的如何集选，新民歌的如何歌唱与朗诵等等，还都须精心研究，才能逐渐作出结论。那么，在这篇小文里即暂且不提这些问题。不过，这次的既看又听、活泼生动的展览，对研究那些问题会有些帮助，是没有什么疑问的。
