Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 11th December. The Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, held here, today passed a resolution on the situation in the Taiwan Strait. The resolution strongly condemns the United States' armed intervention in the Taiwan Strait region and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

The resolution stated, "Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Kinmen, and Matsu have been an integral part of Chinese territory since ancient times. The Chinese people's liberation of these islands in order to unify their country is China's internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere." The resolution condemns the United States for assembling a huge armed force in the Taiwan Strait region and constantly carrying out war threats and provocations against the People's Republic of China.

The resolution stated, "Now the United States is trying to create 'two Chinas.' Their aim is to separate Taiwan from the map of China in order to be able to occupy it forever. We fully condemn this behavior. There is only one China. Any attempt to interfere with a part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, under any pretext, will be opposed not only by the Chinese people and youth, but also by all people and youth with a sense of justice in the world. This attempt by the United States is not only a crude interference in China's internal affairs, but also a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world."

The resolution called on the youth of all countries to "continue to actively support the struggle of the Chinese people and youth, demanding that the US armed forces immediately and completely withdraw from the Taiwan Strait region, stop all interference in China, and let the Chinese people solve their own internal affairs."

The meeting also passed resolutions on the situation in Korea, as well as issues such as Okinawa, Goa, and West Irian.

    世界民主青联执委会会议决议
    斥美国企图永占台湾
    新华社科伦坡11日电  在这里举行的世界民主青年联盟执行委员会会议今天通过了一项关于台湾海峡局势的决议。决议强烈谴责美国在台湾海峡地区的武装干涉行动和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    决议说，“台湾、澎湖列岛、金门、马祖自古以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分。中国人民为了统一他们的国家而解放这些岛屿，是中国人民的内政，任何人无权加以干涉。”决议谴责美国在台湾海峡地区集结了巨大的武装力量，不断对中华人民共和国进行战争威胁和挑衅。
    决议说，“现在美国试图制造‘两个中国’。他们的目的是要从中国的版图上把台湾割裂出去，以便能够永远占领它。我们全力谴责这种行为。中国只有一个。不论在任何借口下，染指中华人民共和国一部分领土的一切企图，不仅要遭到中国人民和青年的反对，而且也要遭到全世界一切有正义感的人和青年的反对。美国的这种尝试不仅是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，而且也是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁”。
    决议号召世界各国青年“继续积极支持中国人民和青年的斗争，要求美国武装力量立即完全从台湾海峡地区撤退，停止对中国的一切干涉，让中国人民解决他们自己的内政。”
    会议还通过了朝鲜局势以及冲绳、果阿、西伊里安等多项问题的决议。
