    Welcome to the Representatives of the Heroic Algerian People
    At Beijing Airport
    Speech by Vice Premier Peng Dehuai

    Respected distinguished guests of the Algerian Provisional Government Delegation, Respected Minister Youcef Ben Khedda, Respected Minister Mahmoud Cherif, Friends, Comrades:
    Today, we feel very honored and happy to be able to welcome here the representatives of the heroic Algerian people, the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I would like to express our highest respect to you, our Algerian brothers who are engaged in heroic struggles.
    Although our two countries are far apart, common experiences and common struggles closely link the people of our two countries together. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence. The Chinese people have always regarded your victories as their own victories and have been greatly encouraged and supported by your victories. The Chinese people are willing to further develop the fighting friendship between our two peoples and further strengthen our mutual support in the common struggle. I believe that during your visit to China, distinguished guests will see everywhere the sincere friendship of the Chinese people towards the Algerian people.
    Not long ago, the Algerian Republic was formally established, marking a major victory in the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation. The Chinese people warmly celebrated the birth of the Algerian Republic, and the Chinese government quickly recognized the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. This has brought the friendship between our two peoples into a new stage. Today, the first government delegation of the Algerian Republic has arrived in our capital. I firmly believe that your visit will further promote the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian peoples and will contribute to the friendly cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries.
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian peoples!
    Long live the friendly cooperation between the peoples of Asian and African countries!
    Long live world peace!

    欢迎英雄的阿尔及利亚人民的代表
    在北京的飞机场上
    彭德怀副总理的讲话尊敬的阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团各位贵宾，尊敬的优素福·本·赫达部长阁下，尊敬的马哈茂德·谢里夫部长阁下，朋友们，同志们：
    今天，我们能够在这里欢迎英雄的阿尔及利亚人民的代表、阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，感到十分荣幸和高兴。首先，我代表中国政府和中国人民向你们，正在进行着英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚兄弟们，表示最崇高的敬意。
    尽管我们两国相距很远，但是共同的遭遇和共同的斗争却把我们两国人民紧紧地连在一起。中国人民一贯同情和支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。中国人民从来就把你们的胜利都看成是自己的胜利，并且从你们的胜利中得到很大的鼓舞和支持。中国人民愿意进一步发展我们两国人民的战斗友谊，并且进一步加强我们在共同斗争中的相互支持。我相信，贵宾们在中国访问期间，将会到处看到中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的这种真挚的情谊。
    不久以前，阿尔及利亚共和国正式成立，这标志着阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放斗争的重大胜利。中国人民热烈地庆祝了阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，中国政府迅速地承认了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。这就使我们两国人民之间的友谊进入了一个新的阶段。今天，阿尔及利亚共和国的第一个政府代表团又到达了我国的首都。我深信，你们的访问必将进一步促进中阿两国人民的友谊，并且将有助于亚非各国人民的友好合作。
    中、阿两国人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非各国人民的友好合作万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
