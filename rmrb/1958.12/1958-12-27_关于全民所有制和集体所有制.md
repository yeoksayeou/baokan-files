On Ownership by the Whole People and Collective Ownership
    Jing Qiu
    Under the socialist system, there exist two forms of public ownership of the means of production: ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Ownership by the whole people is a higher form of socialist public ownership and plays a leading role in the national economy. Enterprises based entirely on state property, such as state-owned factories, mines, railways, and farms, belong to this type of ownership. Collective ownership is associated with cooperative ownership, such as agricultural producers' cooperatives, handicraft producers' cooperatives, and consumer cooperatives before the communization, and the current people's communes, which are also basically a form of collective ownership.
    From the perspective of ownership of the means of production, the means of production, products, and labor of workers in state-owned enterprises are publicly owned within the entire society. Therefore, in state-owned enterprises, socialist relations of production dominate in their most mature and thorough form. Lenin pointed out in his famous article "On Cooperation" that enterprises in which both the means of production and the land used for building the enterprise, as well as the entire enterprise, belong to the state are enterprises of a completely socialist type.
    Enterprises under the collective ownership form within the socialist system are also socialist enterprises. Taking the people's commune as an example, its main means of production are collectively owned property. There are no classes that own the means of production and no classes that are deprived of the means of production. In addition, there are collective public buildings and production funds. Furthermore, members of the people's commune work together in the public economy. However, the ownership of the people's commune is, after all, different from that of enterprises under ownership by the whole people. This difference is mainly reflected in the fact that state-owned enterprises are the property of the entire people, while the means of production of the people's commune are still largely the property of the collective of laborers.
    From the perspective of the products of the two economic forms of ownership, the main characteristic of enterprises under ownership by the whole people is that all the means of production and products of the enterprise can be directly and rationally distributed by the state, which represents the entire people, according to the needs of the entire national economy. In contrast, only a small part of the products of rural people's communes is directly controlled by the state in the form of agricultural taxes, and the vast majority is still controlled by the commune itself. The exchange of products between the state and rural people's communes, and between communes, is still carried out according to the laws of commodity circulation.
    In addition, all products of state-owned enterprises are the property of the whole people and are included in the unified national fund. Therefore, the labor remuneration of workers and staff is paid from the unified national fund, while all products and income of the people's commune are the property of the commune, and the income of the members is obtained from the total income of the commune.
    State-owned enterprises, as thorough socialist enterprises, are directly subordinate to the state, and the state leads them through its appointed personnel. The state plans the production activities of these enterprises and stipulates the basic principles of their work. The people's commune, on the other hand, is basically still a collective economy, and all major issues related to the public economy within the commune are decided by the members' assembly or the commune's management committee.
    In the process of socialist construction, the two forms of ownership will gradually develop into a single form of ownership by the whole people, in order to prepare the conditions for the highest degree of unity of economic relations unique to communism. Currently, the rural people's communes already possess certain elements of ownership by the whole people.
    The key to the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people lies in the development of productive forces and the improvement of the masses' level of consciousness. At present, these conditions are not yet met. This is because the overall economic level of our country is still quite low, industry is not yet developed enough, the commodity economy of the people's communes is not developed enough, the economic development of various regions varies greatly, and the income of farmers is also very inconsistent. Therefore, in order to realize the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, it is necessary to accelerate the development of the socialist economy and strengthen the socialist and communist education of the masses. According to the resolution on several issues concerning the people's communes, rural people's communes should further develop commodity production, which will not only enable the entire social economy to develop more rapidly, but also enable the communes to exchange for more machinery and equipment, consumer goods, and cash, greatly promoting the development of the commune's productive forces and improving the living standards of its members. At the same time, county-level cooperative associations should be established universally in various regions to gradually increase the elements of ownership by the whole people in the communes, promote the improvement of the economic level of the entire region, and expand the scope of members' concern for the public economy. Only on this basis, by taking appropriate steps to gradually increase the elements of ownership by the whole people in the communes and gradually increase the share of the communes' products that are under the unified control of the state, can collective ownership be transformed into ownership by the whole people when conditions are ripe.

    关于全民所有制和集体所有制
    静秋
    社会主义制度下存在着两种生产资料公有制的形式，即全民所有制形式和集体所有制形式。全民所有制是社会主义公有制的高级形式，在国民经济中起着领导的作用。属于这种所有制的，是完全以国家财产为基础的企业，即国营的工厂、矿山、铁路和农场等。属于集体所有制的，是同合作社所有制形式相联系的企业，如公社化以前的农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社和消费合作社等，目前的人民公社，基本上也是集体所有制的经济形式。
    从生产资料的所有制来看，国营企业中的生产资料、产品和职工的劳动，在整个社会范围内是公有的。因此，在国营企业中，社会主义生产关系以最成熟的最彻底的形式占着统治地位。列宁曾在著名的
  “论合作制”一文中指出：无论是生产资料还是建筑企业用的土地以及整个企业都属于国家的企业，是彻底的社会主义类型的企业。
    社会主义制度下的集体所有制形式的企业，也是社会主义类型的企业。以人民公社为例，它的主要的生产资料是集体的财产，在这里没有占有生产资料的阶级和被剥夺了生产资料的阶级。此外，还有一部分集体的公共建筑物和生产资金等。此外，人民公社社员也在公有经济中共同劳动，但是，人民公社的所有制，毕竟还不同于全民所有制的企业。这种差别主要表现在国营企业是全民的财产，而人民公社的生产资料，大部分仍然属于劳动者的集体的财产。
    从两种所有制经济形式的产品来看，全民所有制企业的主要标志是企业的全部生产资料和产品可以直接由代表全体人民的国家按照整个国民经济需要作统一的合理的分配。而农村人民公社的产品，只有小部分以农业税等形式归国家直接支配，绝大部分仍然由公社自己支配。国家同农村人民公社之间、公社同公社之间，仍然按照商品流通的规律来实现产品的相互交换。
    此外，国营企业的全部产品是全民的财产，纳入全国的统一的资金，因此，工人和职员的劳动报酬由全国的统一资金中支付，而人民公社的全部产品和收入则是本公社的财产，社员的收入是从本公社的总收入中取得的。
    国营企业作为彻底的社会主义类型的企业而直接隶属于国家，国家通过自己委任的工作人员来领导它们。国家计划这些企业的生产活动，规定这些企业工作的基本原则。而人民公社则基本上仍是一种集体经济，社内公共经济的一切重大问题都由社员大会或社的管理委员会决定。
    在社会主义建设的过程中，两种所有制将逐步发展到单一的全民所有制，以为建立共产主义所特有的经济关系的最高度的统一准备条件。目前农村的人民公社，已经具有了某些全民所有制的成分。
    由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，关键在于生产力的发展和群众觉悟水平的提高。在目前，这些条件还没有具备。因为目前我国整个经济水平还相当低，工业还不够发达，人民公社的商品经济也不够发达，各地区的经济发展情况又有很大差异，农民的收入也很不一致。因此，为了实现由集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡，就必须加紧发展社会主义经济，同时加强对群众的社会主义和共产主义教育。按照关于人民公社若干问题的决议，农村人民公社应该进一步发展商品生产，这将不仅可以使整个社会经济得到更迅速的发展，而且可以使公社换回更大量的机器设备、消费物资和现金，大大促进公社生产力的发展和社员生活水平的提高。同时，各地应该普遍建立县联社的组织，逐步增加公社的全民所有制成分，促进整个地区经济水平的提高，同时扩大社员对公有经济关心的范围。只有在这个基础上，采取适当步骤，逐步增加公社的全民所有制的成分，逐步增加公社的产品由国家统一支配的份额，才能在条件成熟的时候把集体所有制转变为全民所有制。
