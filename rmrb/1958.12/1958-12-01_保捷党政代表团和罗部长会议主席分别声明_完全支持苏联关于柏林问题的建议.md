Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 30th. The Bulgarian and Czechoslovakian Party and Government Delegations have issued a statement here regarding the results of their talks from the 21st to the 26th of November.

The statement welcomes and fully supports the Soviet proposal to end the occupation status of Berlin and withdraw foreign troops from Berlin.

The statement points out that Western countries have undermined the Potsdam Agreement, revived West German imperialism and militarism, and strengthened fascist forces. The statement expresses full support for the just struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic against the revival of German imperialism and for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Referring to the aggressive and provocative actions of the United States in the Taiwan Strait area, the statement points out that both sides stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people. Both sides insist that the U.S. aggressor troops immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, and that interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people be stopped.

The statement says: "For the benefit of world peace, the People's Republic of China should take its legitimate seat in the United Nations as soon as possible. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve any important international problem."

Both sides believe that the United States should immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea and other regions of the Far East, because the presence of American troops in these places undermines the independence of various countries, endangers the security of various countries and world peace.

Both sides express warm sympathy and welcome the just struggle of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries for freedom and national independence.

The Czechoslovak delegation stated in the statement that it fully supports the peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria aimed at maintaining friendly relations with all Balkan countries and maintaining and consolidating peace in this region of the world.

The statement said that the delegations of the two countries welcomed the outline report on the control figures of the Soviet Union's seven-year long-range plan to be presented by Khrushchev to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They believe that the outline points out the brilliant prospects for striving for the victory of communism in the Soviet Union, the unprecedented development of the entire socialist camp, and the inevitable victory of socialism in the economic competition with capitalism.

The statement believes that "continuing to resolutely struggle against all manifestations of modern revisionism in the future, and persistently exposing its essence and purpose, is its international obligation. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the various statements of the Yugoslav leaders are typical representatives of revisionism of Marxism-Leninism."

The statement points out that all attempts made by modern revisionists to create ideological confusion in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries and to undermine the unity of the international revolutionary workers' movement have been completely defeated. In the struggle against the revisionists, the ideological unity and combat effectiveness of the international revolutionary workers' movement have been further strengthened and consolidated. The statement points out that the declaration and the peace manifesto adopted at the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in November 1957 have had a very beneficial influence on strengthening the entire international revolutionary workers' movement and on the Communist Parties of Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The arguments and conclusions made in these two documents have been fully confirmed by the development of international events. The statement concludes: "The fraternal meeting of the party and government delegations of the two countries will further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 30th. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, Chivu Stoica, said on the 29th that the government of the Romanian People's Republic warmly welcomes and fully supports the constructive proposal of the Soviet Union to give West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city. He added that this proposal is of particular significance. It "not only fully conforms to the interests of the security of the people of socialist countries, but also fully conforms to the interests of the security of the people of all other countries."

Chivu Stoica made these remarks at a reception held by the Albanian Embassy in Romania to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Albania.

Chivu Stoica also said: While looking forward to the future with confidence, our people cannot but be vigilant against the anti-peace conspiracy of the imperialist bloc. Our people are closely watching the dangerous development of the situation in West Germany, which is the result of the policies of the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism. Our people believe that the revival of revanchist West German militarism and the nuclear armament of the Bundeswehr pose a serious danger to the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

    保捷党政代表团和罗部长会议主席分别声明
    完全支持苏联关于柏林问题的建议
    新华社索非亚30日电  保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克党和政府代表团就21日至26日的会谈结果在这里发表了声明。
    声明表示欢迎并且完全支持苏联关于结束柏林占领状态和从柏林撤退外国驻军的建议。
    声明指出，西方国家破坏了波茨坦协定，复活了西德帝国主义和军国主义，并加强了法西斯力量。声明表示完全支持德意志民主共和国人民反对德国帝国主义复活、争取和平统一德国的正义斗争。
    声明在谈到美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略性挑衅行动时指出，双方坚定不移地站在中国人民这一边。双方坚持要求美国侵略军队立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区，要求停止对中国人民内政的干涉。
    声明说：“为了世界和平的利益，应当尽快地让中华人民共和国在联合国中占有它的合法席位。没有中华人民共和国的参加，就不可能解决任何一个重要的国际问题”。
    双方认为美国应该把它的军队立即从南朝鲜和远东其他地区撤出，因为美国军队驻在这些地方，破坏了各国独立，危害了各国安全以及世界和平。
    双方表示热烈同情和欢迎亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民争取自由和民族独立的正义斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团在声明中表示完全支持保加利亚人民共和国的旨在同所有巴尔干国家保持友好关系、旨在维护和巩固世界这个地区和平的和平外交政策。
    声明说，两国代表团欢迎赫鲁晓夫即将向苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的苏联七年远景计划控制数字的报告提纲。他们认为提纲指出了为争取共产主义在苏联胜利而奋斗的光辉前景，指出了整个社会主义阵营空前发展的前景和社会主义在同资本主义的经济竞赛中必然胜利。
    声明认为，“今后继续同现代修正主义的各种表现作坚决斗争，坚持不懈地揭穿它的实质和目的，是自己的国际义务。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领和南斯拉夫领导人的各种言论是修正马克思列宁主义的典型代表”。
    声明指出，现代修正主义分子想在各国共产党和工人党队伍中制造思想上混乱和破坏国际革命工人运动团结的一切尝试，已经遭到了彻底失败，在反对修正主义分子的斗争中，国际革命工人运动思想上的团结和战斗力已更加加强和巩固了。声明指出，1957年11月各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议所通过的宣言和和平宣言，对于加强整个国际革命工人运动，对于保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克共产党，起了很有益的影响。这两个文件所作的论断和结论已完全为国际事件的发展所证实。声明最后说：“两国党和政府代表团的兄弟会见将进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的团结”。
    新华社布加勒斯特30日电  罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡29日说，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府热烈欢迎和完全支持苏联关于给西柏林以非军事化的自由城市地位的建设性建议。他又说，这个建议具有特别的意义。它“不仅完全符合社会主义国家人民的安全的利益，而且也完全符合一切其他国家人民的安全的利益。”
    基伏·斯托伊卡是在阿尔巴尼亚驻罗马尼亚大使馆为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十四周年而举行的招待会上说这番话的。
    基伏·斯托伊卡还说：我国人民在满怀信心地展望未来时，不能不对帝国主义集团反对和平的阴谋提高警惕。我国人民密切地注视着西德局势的危险发展，这种发展是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团政策的后果。我国人民认为，复仇主义的西德军国主义的复活和联邦国防军的原子武装，为欧洲和全世界的和平事业带来了严重的危险。
