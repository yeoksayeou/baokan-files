Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd dispatch from New York: An article written by Max Lerner published in the "New York Post" on December 7th mocked Dulles' policy of "non-recognition" of China.

The article, titled "Iron Cage," argued that Dulles was "locked in his own rigid iron cage." The article stated that the China issue is "one of the best cases to be found in the chronic rigidity of American policy."

The author sarcastically pointed out that while American scientists and technicians, after failed rocket launches, are "willing to learn from their mistakes," "abandoning any ineffective or partially failed methods and trying something that might work," Dulles and other American policymakers are not. The author mocked Dulles, saying that his speech at the California Chamber of Commerce not long ago was "a somewhat pathetic scene," "standing there was an old man who had not grown wiser with age, wielding at our enemies the only weapon he could use against them, a broken old wooden musket—whose name is 'Non-Recognition.'"

The author said, "While Mr. Dulles is tightly gripping his wooden musket of non-recognition, the world around him is in turmoil and upheaval. The tide of revolution is sweeping across every continent."

"But in the face of this revolutionary upheaval, our policy remains unchanged, and Mr. Dulles still clings to non-recognition as his weapon."

The author, considering the interests of the American ruling group, believes that "not recognizing the existence of a government that has effectively ruled over five hundred million" (should be six hundred million - editor) people for ten years" cannot achieve the goal of "winning the hearts of neutral countries around the world." The author said, "Dulles seems to be locked in an iron cage composed of his own cherished theories, his own anxieties, and his own dreams," and he "seems determined to fall with the small flag of non-recognition bravely flying in the surrounding storm."

### 杜勒斯“不承认”中国是自囚于僵硬的铁笼  “纽约邮报”如是说

    杜勒斯“不承认”中国是自囚于僵硬的铁笼
    “纽约邮报”如是说
    新华社22日讯  纽约消息：12月7日“纽约邮报”发表的马克斯·勒讷写的一篇文章，嘲笑了杜勒斯的“不承认”中国的政策。
    这篇以“铁笼”为题的文章认为，杜勒斯是“关在他自己的僵硬的铁笼中”了。文章说，中国问题是美国政策“一贯犯的僵硬毛病中所能找到的一个最好的病例”。
    作者讥讽地指出，美国的科学技术人员在发射火箭失败以后，尚且“愿意从他们的错误中吸收教训”，“抛弃不收效或者是部分失败的任何办法，并且尝试可能收效的某种办法”，但是杜勒斯等美国决策人却不是如此。作者嘲笑说，杜勒斯不久前在加利福尼亚商会发表演说时是“一个有点可怜的场面”，“站在那里的是他这样一个没有随着年龄的增长而变得聪明的老人，他对我们的敌人挥舞着他能够用以对付敌人的唯一的武器，一支被打坏的古老的木制滑膛枪——它的名字叫‘不承认’”。
    作者说，“在杜勒斯先生紧紧地握着他的不承认这一支木制滑膛枪的时候，他周围的世界在发生着变乱和动乱。革命的浪潮正在席卷每个大陆”。
  “但是在这种革命的动荡形势面前，我国的政策依然故我，杜勒斯先生仍然死抱住不承认作为他的武器”。
    作者从美国统治集团的利益考虑，认为“不承认对五亿多”（应为六亿多——编者）人民已有效地进行了十年统治的政府的存在”，不能达到“获得全世界中立国家的人心”的目标。作者说，“杜勒斯似乎关在他自己的得意的理论、他自己的担忧和他自己的梦想组成的铁笼中了”，他“似乎决心同在周围的风暴中勇敢地飘扬的不承认的小旗一起倒下去”。
