    Changde Prefecture on the banks of Dongting Lake has been vigorously reforming tools in the winter water conservancy construction movement, and work efficiency has been rapidly improved. On November 20, the 700,000-strong labor force on the construction site created a high work efficiency of an average of 15 cubic meters of earth transported per person, which is more than nine times higher than the average work efficiency last year. A portion of advanced groups achieved an average work efficiency of 800 cubic meters per person. At present, more than 300 types and more than 1 million pieces of various new-style tools have been promoted in the district's winter construction. In more than 3,000 projects that have started in the district, 80% have basically achieved earth mechanization. Now, as soon as you enter the construction site, you can see the distinctive features of this year's winter water conservancy construction: flat-ground rail earth trains, high-altitude cableways for earth transportation, wooden boats and bamboo rafts on the water shuttle back and forth, blasting for earth extraction, mechanical compaction, automatic trolleys, and automatic dumping, basically eliminating the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and hoe digging. The masses describe the magnificent scene of earth mechanization as: "floating on the water, pushing on the flat ground, sliding on the slopes, and flying in the air." It is estimated that the district's winter construction projects can be completed 65 days ahead of schedule. In this water conservancy movement, the district has concentrated more than 50,000 blacksmiths and carpenters, who have gone deep into the construction sites to set up more than 3,600 factories for on-site manufacturing, use, modification, and repair.

    常德专区大部水利工程半机械化
    本报讯  洞庭湖滨常德专区在冬修水利运动中，大闹工具改革，工效迅速提高。11月20日，在工地上的七十万劳动大军，创造了平均每人运土十五公方的高工效，比去年平均工效提高九倍多。一部分先进小组平均每人工效达到八百公方。目前，全区冬修中已推广的各种新式工具有三百多种、一百多万件。全区已开工的三千多处工程，有80％基本上实现了土机械化。现在，一走进工地，就可以看到今年冬修水利鲜明的特色：平地轨道土火车，高空架索运土忙，水上木船竹筏如梭，爆破取土，机械夯压，自动滑车，自动倒土，基本上消灭了肩挑背负，锄挖手夯的现象。群众形容土机械化的雄伟场面是：“水上漂，平地推，坡上滑，空中飞。”预计全区冬修工程可以提前在六十五天中完成。在这次水利运动中，全区共集中五万多名铁木工，深入工地办起三千六百多个工厂，随制随用，随用随改，随坏随修。
