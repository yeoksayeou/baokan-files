Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Beijing's light industry and commercial departments, as well as the industrial bureaus of various districts, have recently convened meetings to arrange the production of over eighty types of products urgently needed for people's lives, such as soap, candles, snap fasteners, shoelace eyelets, batteries, and enamel mugs.

In these arrangements, to overcome the difficulty of raw material shortages, many factories are not only utilizing scraps and waste materials, but also extensively seeking substitute raw materials. Chongwen District, which has the most factories producing daily-use small commodities, is using scraps from machinery and metal factories to manufacture snap fasteners, shoelace eyelets, shoelace tips, trouser hooks, and other products. Qinghe Woolen Mill is using leftover yarn ends as raw materials and makeshift, repaired machines as equipment to set up a small knitting factory, which can produce thick wool sweaters, socks, headscarves, scarves, and other items. It has already produced more than 1,000 pieces. For some factories that manufacture daily necessities but lack raw materials, the relevant departments in Beijing are also preparing to allocate a portion of raw materials to help them rapidly increase production.

    北京轻工业部门排除原材料不足困难
    抓紧生产生活日用品
    据新华社19日讯  北京市轻工业和商业部门及各区工业局最近先后召集会议，安排了人民生活急需的肥皂、洋蜡、子母扣、鞋眼、电池、搪瓷口杯等八十多种产品的生产。
    在安排中，为了克服原材料不足的困难，许多工厂除了利用下脚料和废弃品以外，还广泛寻找代用原料。生产日用小百货的工厂最多的崇文区，正在利用机械、金属工厂的下脚料，制造子母扣、鞋眼、鞋带阡、裤钩等产品。清河制呢厂用剩余的纱头当原料，用经过拼凑修理的破机器做设备，办起了一个小针织厂，能生产粗线毛衣、袜子、头巾、围巾等用品，现在已生产了一千多件。对于一些制造人民生活急需品而又缺乏原材料的工厂，北京市的有关部门也正在准备调拨一部分原材料，帮助他们迅速提高产量。
