    Commune No. 1 Universal Simple Rolling Mill
    Metallurgical Industry Ministry Working Group
    Not long ago, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry organized several comrades from the Beijing Iron and Steel Design Institute and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Design Institute to design a set of universal simple rolling mills, with reference to existing small-scale simple rolling mills in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guxian, Kaifeng and other places. With the strong support of the workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's Machine Repair Factory, it has been successfully trial-produced in the factory, and the trial rolling situation is good.

    Using a rolling mill to replace red furnace forging is a technological revolution, and it has many benefits. First of all, some steel materials, such as thin steel plates, cannot be forged in a red furnace, but can be solved by using a rolling mill. Moreover, the rolled finished product has regular dimensions, which can save steel consumption. For example, a shovel requires four catties of steel material when forged in a red furnace, but only three catties of steel material is needed if made with rolled steel plate, and it is also lighter to use. Secondly, the labor productivity of the rolling mill is high. The design capacity of a simple rolling mill is 1,500 tons of steel per year, and only twelve people are required to operate it. If the same amount of steel is forged in a red furnace, more than 1,000 people would be required, and labor productivity is increased by a hundred times. At the same time, the labor intensity of rolling steel is much lighter than using a red furnace.

    In the past, many people regarded steel rolling as too mysterious, thinking that steel could only be rolled in "large" and "foreign" factories, fearing that using rolling mills was too complicated and operation was very difficult. The production of simple rolling mills has greatly liberated people's minds. It is not too difficult to manufacture this kind of simple rolling mill; it only took ten days from design to production and trial rolling. This set of rolling mills is suitable for the needs of small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises in various people's communes. It can not only roll thin steel plates, but also roll shaped steel and wire, so it is named "Commune No. 1 Universal Simple Rolling Mill."

    Commune No. 1 Universal Simple Rolling Mill has six major advantages

    1. Simple structure: Except for some steel materials used for the pressing screws and the shafts of the belt pulleys, the other parts are all cast iron, and very little machining is required. Small machine factories in various places can manufacture them.

    2. Small power requirement: Only a 25-horsepower power machine is needed to drive it. Boiler-locomotive engines, diesel engines, gas engines, gasoline engines, or electric motors can all be used to drive the rolling mill.

    3. Many product specifications can be rolled: It can roll small round steel, wire, square steel, flat steel, as well as shovel plates and silicon steel sheets, meeting the diverse needs of rural areas for steel materials.

    4. Operation is relatively simple: You can understand it at a glance, and learn it as soon as you try.

    5. Wide adaptability to raw materials: Whether it is indigenous steel ingots or other scrap steel materials, medium and thick steel plate trimming, cutting heads, scrap steel heads, etc., can all be used to roll into steel.

    6. The equipment is relatively light: The rolling mill itself weighs only a little over one ton, and the entire set of equipment, including the transmission device, weighs only about three tons. Installation and adjustment are very easy.

    公社号万能简易轧钢机
    冶金工业部工作组
    不久以前冶金工业部组织了北京黑色冶金设计总院和武汉黑色冶金设计院的几个同志，参考北京、上海、天津、故县、开封等地现有小型简易轧钢机，设计了一套万能简易轧钢机，并且得到武汉钢铁公司机修厂的职工们的大力支持，已在该厂试制成功，试轧情况良好。
    采用轧钢机来代替红炉锻造是一个技术上的革命，它的好处很多。首先是有些钢材，例如薄钢板，在红炉上锻不出来，利用轧钢机就能解决，并且轧制出来的成品尺寸规矩，可以节省钢的消耗。譬如一把铁锹，用红炉锻成要四斤钢料，如果用轧出来的钢板做，只要三斤钢料，使用起来也比较轻巧。其次，是轧钢机的劳动生产率高，一套简易轧钢机的设计能力每年可生产一千五百吨钢材，只要十二个人操作，倘用红炉锻同样数量的钢材就得一千多人，劳动生产率提高一百倍，同时轧钢的劳动强度比用红炉要轻得多。
    过去很多人把轧钢看得太神秘，以为只有在“大”“洋”的工厂里才能轧钢，怕用轧钢机太复杂，操作很困难。简易轧钢机制成后，就大大解放了人们的思想。制造这种简易轧钢机并不太困难，连设计到制成试轧，一共只花了十天工夫。这套轧钢机适合各人民公社小型钢铁联合企业的需要，不仅能轧薄钢板，还能轧制型钢和线材，所以命名为“公社号万能简易轧钢机。”
    公社号万能简易轧钢机有六大优点
    1．结构简单：除去压下螺丝及皮带轮的轴用了一些钢料，其他部件都是用铁铸成的，需要机器加工的地方很少，各地小型机器工厂都能制造。
    2．需要动力小：只要一个二十五马力的动力机就能带动。锅驼机、柴油机、煤气机、汽油机或电动机等都可以用来带动轧钢机。
    3．轧制的产品规格多：既能轧小型圆钢、线材、方钢、扁钢，又能轧锹板和矽钢片，适合农村对钢材的多种需要。
    4．操作比较简单：一看就懂，一学就会。
    5．对原料的适应性很广：不论是土钢钢锭或其他废钢料，中、厚钢板剪边、切头、废钢头等，都可用来轧成钢材。
    6，设备较轻：轧钢机本身仅一吨多重，加上传动装置等全套设备也只有三吨来重，安装与调整都很容易。
