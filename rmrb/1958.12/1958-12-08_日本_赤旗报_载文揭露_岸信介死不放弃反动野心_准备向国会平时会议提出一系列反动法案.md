Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 6th: Japan's "Akahata" reported today that the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to submit amendments to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and other reactionary bills to the 31st Regular Diet Session, scheduled to convene on December 10th, in order to establish a Japan-U.S. military alliance system.

"Akahata" pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi recently convened two meetings of leading cadres of the Liberal Democratic Party's "mainstream faction," intending to unite the "mainstream faction" and recklessly issuing reactionary remarks and taking reactionary actions, including re-submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and submitting amendments to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." From these circumstances, it is clear that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is consistently adopting a reactionary political line.

"Akahata" pointed out that within the government and the Liberal Democratic Party, factional contradictions are becoming increasingly acute over the question of whether Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands should be included in the "defense area." The newspaper pointed out that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a fundamental requirement of Japanese and U.S. monopoly capitalists. It said that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is attempting to pass the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" amendment all at once at the Regular Diet Session.

"Akahata" pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet intends to submit most of the thirty-five bills that were not deliberated at the last Extraordinary Diet Session at the beginning of the Diet session. These bills that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is attempting to pass can be divided into the following three categories: First, bills prepared to get rid of the increasingly serious economic crisis and protect the interests of monopoly capital, such as the "Anti-Monopoly Law Amendment" and the "Import and Export Trade Law Amendment"; Second, bills prepared to suppress the Japanese people, including the working class, such as the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," the "Broadcasting Law Amendment," and the "Social Education Law Amendment"; Third, bills prepared to win over the middle class, so that they will lean towards the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, in order to split the people's front, such as the "Minimum Wage Law" and the "National Health Insurance Law Amendment."

"Akahata" also revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is not only attempting to submit these bills, but is also attempting to find opportunities to submit bills such as the "Anti-Espionage Law" and the "Secrecy Law" to the Diet session.

    日本“赤旗报”载文揭露
    岸信介死不放弃反动野心
    准备向国会平时会议提出一系列反动法案
    新华社6日讯  东京消息：“赤旗报”今天说，岸信介政府正在企图向预定在12月10日召开的第三十一次国会平时会议提出日美“安全条约”修正案和其它的反动法案，以便建立日美军事同盟体系。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介最近两次召开自由民主党“主流派”领导干部会议，打算把“主流派”团结起来，并且肆无忌惮地发表反动的言论和采取反动的行动，其中包括要重新提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”和提出日美“安全条约”修正案。从这些情况看来，显然，岸信介内阁始终是要采取反动的政治路线的。
    “赤旗报”指出，在政府和自由民主党内部，围绕着冲绳和小笠原群岛是否要划入“防御地区”的问题，派系的矛盾越来越尖锐。报纸指出，修改日美“安全条约”是日美垄断资本家的根本要求。它说，岸信介内阁企图在国会平时会议上一下子就通过日美“安全条约”修正案。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介内阁打算在国会会议举行的初期就把在上次国会临时会议上没有审议完的三十五项法案的大部分提出来。岸信介内阁企图通过的这些法案可以分成下列三类：一、准备用来摆脱日益严重的经济危机，保护垄断资本利益的法案，譬如“禁止垄断法修正案”和“进出口贸易法修正案”等；二、准备用来镇压包括工人阶级在内的日本人民的法案，如“警察官职务执行法修正案”、“广播法修正案”和“社会教育法修正案”等；三、准备用来拉拢中间阶层，使它们靠拢岸信介内阁，以便分裂人民的阵线的法案，譬如“最低工资法案”和“国民健康保险法修正案”等。
    “赤旗报”还揭露，岸信介内阁不仅企图提出这些法案，而且还企图寻找机会向国会会议提出“防谍法案”和“保密法案”等法案。
