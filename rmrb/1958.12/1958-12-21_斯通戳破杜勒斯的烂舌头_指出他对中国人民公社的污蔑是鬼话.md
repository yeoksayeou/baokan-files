Xinhua News Agency, 20th. New York dispatch: The American "Stone Weekly" published an article by Stone on the 15th, ridiculing Dulles' shameless slander of the Chinese People's Commune system. The author believes that "a giant has awakened and is lifting himself out of poverty through self-reliance. It is unwise to close our eyes to this progress."

The author wrote: "Dulles, not long ago in San Francisco, reached the climax of his speech on 'Why we should never - yes, never - recognize Communist China,' and talked about the 'danger' this situation poses to traditional Chinese culture. The Secretary of State, with an almost Confucian anger, said that the Chinese 'sacred ancestral tombs have been desecrated everywhere.'" Stone ridiculed Dulles on this point, saying, "Unfortunately, he did not continue along this line. In fact, it is more than just the decline of the custom of respecting ancestors. In China, the bride and groom now marry without consulting horoscopes, and houses are built without consulting feng shui." Stone went on to write that this "contempt for heaven" would sooner or later cause the Chinese regime to "collapse" in Dulles' view.

Stone said that Dulles also talked about the "horror" the Chinese people are experiencing and the so-called "brutal destruction of individuality and personality." In this regard, Stone used the situation in old China as a comparison, powerfully exposing Dulles' lies. Stone wrote: "In the old days, the poorest coolie or rickshaw puller in Shanghai could wander around according to his personal preferences after a day's work and then decide which doorway to spend the night in. That is how 'personality' was developed. Mr. Dulles then talked about the new commune system, saying: 'Children are sent to large-scale nurseries, and women are able to engage in some form of slave labor.' However, in the old days, there were neither 'large-scale' - nor even small-scale private nurseries, and children could not leave their mothers, but both mother and child had to work."

Stone said that these "good old days" still exist in Hong Kong today. A few days after Dulles' speech, Peggy Bowdin talked about the situation in Hong Kong in the December 7th "New York Times Magazine." Bowdin was talking about the "relatively fortunate" people, she said: "In some families, the father has a permanent job, perhaps in a Chinese factory, working ten hours a day, seven days a week. His wife does embroidery at home while taking care of three undernourished children." In addition, hundreds of thousands of people are deprived of the basic right to work while seeing others living in plenty every day. Stone said that these situations in Hong Kong "remind one of the old days throughout Asia."

Stone admitted that the people of the new China are now "making great strides in getting rid of poverty." and said: "I believe their future is in the slums of Hong Kong, which is to say, not found in the old days. Our understanding of the new China's tremendous leap forward has been blinded by hateful propaganda."

When talking about the infinite beauty of the new China's future, Stone said, "The Baltimore Sun" once published a report from its London branch citing a British trade newsletter that China's "Great Leap Forward this year" may make China the third largest steel producer in the world after the United States and the Soviet Union in 1959, surpassing Britain, West Germany and France. The British International Trade Promotion Committee said that this marks "a scale of production level growth that has never been seen in any country before." Stone said: and "It is not good to look at this situation with Mr. Dulles' self-righteous and distorted eyes. The day is coming when the new China will have ample strength to take care of its ancestral tombs."

### 斯通戳破杜勒斯的烂舌头  指出他对中国人民公社的污蔑是鬼话

    斯通戳破杜勒斯的烂舌头
    指出他对中国人民公社的污蔑是鬼话
    新华社20日讯  纽约消息：美国“斯通周刊”15日刊载了一篇斯通写的文章，讥讽杜勒斯对中国人民公社制度的无耻污蔑。文章作者认为，“一个巨人觉醒了，并且正在自力更生地从贫困中摆脱出来。闭着我们的眼睛不看这种进展是不明智的。”
    作者写道：“杜勒斯不久前在旧金山发表的关于‘为什么我们决不——是的，决不——应该承认共产党中国’的演说快到高潮时，谈到了这种情况对于传统中国文化的
  ‘危险’。这位国务卿用一种几乎是孔子式的愤怒口气说：中国‘神圣的祖先的坟墓到处受到了亵渎’。”斯通就这一点挖苦杜勒斯说：“遗憾的是，他没有顺着这种脉络继续谈下去。其实岂止崇敬祖先的风气衰落而已。在中国新郎和新娘现在不经过算八字就结婚，不用看风水就修房屋。”斯通接着写道，这种“蔑视老天爷”的作法在杜勒斯看来迟早也要使中国政权“垮台”的。
    斯通说，杜勒斯也谈到了中国人正在经历着的“恐怖”和所谓“个性和人格遭到了粗暴的摧残”。斯通在这方面拿旧中国的情况来作对比，有力地戳穿了杜勒斯的骗人鬼话。斯通写道：“在过去的日子里，上海最贫苦的苦力或黄包车夫在他劳动了一天以后，可以根据他个人的嗜好到处游逛然后再决定他在哪一家门口过夜。‘人格’就是这样发展的。杜勒斯先生接着谈到新的公社制度时说：‘儿童被送进大规模托儿所，而妇女们就能够从事一部分奴隶劳动’。然而在过去的日子里，既没有‘大规模的’——甚至于私人的小规模托儿所，儿童们也不能离开他们的母亲，但娘儿俩却都得工作。”
    斯通说，这种“过去的好日子”今天在香港仍然存在。在杜勒斯的演说后不几天，佩吉·宝丁在12月7日“纽约时报杂志”上谈到了香港的情况。宝丁所谈的是“比较幸运”的人们，她说：“在有些家庭里，父亲有一个永久性职业，也许是在一家中国工厂里，每天作十小时零工，每星期工作七天。他的太太在家里作刺绣，同时照管三个营养不足的孩子。”此外，成千上万的人们在每天看到别人丰衣足食的情况下竟然被剥夺了基本的工作权利。斯通说，香港这些情况“使人想起了亚洲各地过去的日子”。
    斯通承认，新中国的人民现在正在“摆脱贫困而大步跃进”。并说：“我相信他们的前途是在香港贫民窟中，就是说在过去的日子里找不到的。我们对于新中国巨大的跃进的了解，受到了仇恨宣传的蒙蔽。”
    斯通在谈到新中国前途的无限美好时说，“巴尔的摩太阳报”曾经刊载了它的伦敦分社援引一篇英国贸易通讯的报道说，中国“今年的大跃进”可能使中国在1959年超过英国、西德和法国，成为仅次于美国和苏联以后世界第三个最大的钢铁生产国家。英国国际贸易促进委员会说，这标志着“一种以前在任何国家都不曾有过的生产水平增长的规模”。斯通说：而“如果用杜勒斯先生自以为是的歪曲眼光来看这种情况，是不好的。新中国有充分的力量来照顾它的祖先的坟墓的日子就要到来了。”
