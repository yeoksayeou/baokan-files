A Home for Mothers and Infants
—On the Beijing Dahua Maternal and Child Inn
Xinhua News Agency reporter Wei Renjian

"Dahua, Dahua, warm as home; clean and tidy, excellent work. Breakfast served, tea at night; if guests are sick, you find solutions. The service staff are simply like loving mothers." This is a large-character poster written by Yuan Tianxi, a worker from the Anyang Brick and Tile Factory in Henan, upon leaving the Dahua Maternal and Child Inn. This is one of the many large-character posters on the walls of the inn, expressing the gratitude of the guests towards the inn, the inn's family-like service attitude towards the guests, and the high praise of the masses for the inn.

The Dahua Maternal and Child Inn, located on Xiheyan outside Qianmen in Beijing, was officially established on September 1st this year to meet the special needs of women and children staying in Beijing. The inn's manager and six service staff are all women. They are a group of people with noble communist spirit, a group of people who have made extraordinary achievements in ordinary jobs.

Liu Qing, a technician from the Taiyuan Geological Bureau, came to Beijing in early November on business, bringing with her a little girl who was only three months old. This little girl had a peculiar habit: she refused to eat milk or condensed milk, insisting on breast milk from her mother! Her mother couldn't go out to work after coming to Beijing, which was truly worrying. At this time, Liu Cuiying, a 21-year-old member of the Communist Youth League and a service staff member at the inn, unhesitatingly gave her own milk to the girl, saying, "If I don't do this, how can the child's mother go to work?" For eight days in a row, the little girl thrived, and her mother successfully completed her tasks. Liu Qing was deeply moved and wrote a letter of commendation to the inn and Liu Cuiying before leaving, saying with deep emotion, "You took such good care of us, I really don't want to leave."

Mrs. Shi Han, an elderly woman in her sixties, had a large tumor on her body and couldn't walk. During her stay of more than ten days, the service staff bought her meals, snacks, and Beijing specialties, helped her here and there, and even emptied her chamber pot. Every service staff member enthusiastically took care of her, and the old lady was so moved that she always affectionately called them "girls." When saying goodbye, the old lady said with tears in her eyes to the service staff, "You are even closer than my own daughters. If I come to Beijing again in the future, even if I don't stay at the inn, I will come to see you."

Hanging on the wall of the inn is a large red banner that says "Home for Mothers and Infants," which was given to the inn by Mrs. Zhou Jihui, a 70-year-old woman from Yangcheng County, Shanxi. Mrs. Zhou, her daughter Yang Guiqin, and two grandchildren stayed at the inn in early September. On the night before they left, Yang Guiqin suddenly went into labor. The service staff contacted people everywhere and brought the doctor to the inn. They also borrowed a stove from another unit to make food especially for the mother. When the old lady left, she presented the banner with great enthusiasm and, after returning home, instructed her son in Tianjin to come and express his gratitude.

The service staff of the Dahua Maternal and Child Inn have established the service concept of "everything for the children and mothers," trying their best to make the guests feel even more convenient and warmer than at home. In addition to providing all the general hotel services, such as purchasing supplies for guests, buying tickets for vehicles, ships, movies, and theaters, picking up and delivering luggage, and selling stamps, stationery, envelopes, cigarettes, and tea, they have also added special supplies and services needed by women and infants, such as selling women's sanitary products, cosmetics, contraceptives, children's toys, sweets, and snacks, washing clothes and diapers, and mending clothes. General restaurants do not have food suitable for children, so the inn tried to buy the best Xiaozhan rice to cook porridge for the children. In terms of facilities, special care is also taken to meet the special needs of women and infants. There are bathrooms and barber shops specially for women and infants, children's activity stations, and books and periodicals on children's books and women's health knowledge. In order to take care of the mothers so they can work with peace of mind, they also provide childcare services during the day. Because there are many children living in the inn, the bedding gets dirty easily. More than sixty bed sheets, quilt covers, and pillowcases have to be dismantled and washed every day, and more than thirty rooms have to be cleaned and tidied up. Under the slogan of "Everywhere is clean, fresh and pleasant, health care is complete, and mothers and children are safe," the service staff divide up the work, take full responsibility, wash diligently, change frequently, wipe diligently, sweep diligently, and tidy up diligently to ensure that the windows are bright and the rooms are clean.

The common characteristics of the service staff of the Dahua Maternal and Child Inn are their love for their work, their dedication, and their selflessness. On the corridors on both sides of the guest rooms are pasted poems written by themselves, expressing their joy and enthusiasm:

"Dahua is a home for mothers and infants, serving children and mothers, women and infant guests come to our inn, warmly welcome like family."

In the two months since the inn was established, three service staff members have been rated as all-rounders and clever girls by the district women's federation, and two have been rated as all-rounders by the trade union of the hotel's central store. Du Guilan, a service staff member who won the honorary title of all-rounder and clever girl, was also named a Youth Red Flag Bearer by the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Youth League of Beijing.

This maternal and child inn, which received 2,700 commendations from guests in the two months of September and October, has attended the Beijing Municipal Women's Socialist Construction Activists Congress. Recently, they have been rated as an advanced collective unit to attend the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference.

It is believed that under the leadership of the Party, such a group of women with a high communist spirit will achieve even more outstanding results. (Attached picture)

    妇·婴·之·家
    ——记北京大华妇婴旅社
    新华社记者  魏人鉴
    “大华大华，温暖如家；卫生整洁，工作不差。早晨送点，晚上送茶；客人有病，能想办法。服务员同志简直像慈爱的妈妈。”这是河南安阳砖瓦厂职工袁天喜在离开大华妇婴旅社时写下的大字报。这是旅社墙壁上许多张大字报中的一张，它道出了旅客对旅社的感激心情，道出了旅社对旅客亲如家人的服务态度，道出了群众对旅社的崇高评价。
    北京前门外西河沿的大华妇婴旅社，是为了满足妇女和孩子旅居的特殊需要，在今年9月1日正式成立的。旅社经理和六个服务员都是妇女。她们，是一群具有高尚的共产主义风格的人，是一群在平凡工作岗位上做出不平凡成绩的人。
    太原地质局技术员刘清11月初有事来北京，带来了一个只有三个月的小女孩，这个小女孩有个怪脾气，牛奶、炼乳不肯吃，非吃妈妈的奶不可！她母亲来京后就不能出去工作，真是急得没有办法。这时旅社的服务员、二十一岁的共青团员刘翠英毫不犹豫地把自己的奶喂给女孩吃，她说：“我不这样做，孩子的妈妈怎么去工作呢？”这样一连八天，小女孩过得很好，孩子的妈妈也顺利地完成了任务。刘清大受感动，临走时给旅社和刘翠英写了一张表扬的大字报，情长意深地说：“你们照顾这么好，我真不愿意走。”
    六十多岁的老太太石韩氏，身上生了一个大瘤，又不能走路，在十几天的旅居期间，服务员们为她买饭、买点心、买北京特产，扶她上这儿、上那儿，甚至给她倒屎倒尿。不论那个服务员都热情地照顾她，感动得老太太总是亲切地叫她们姑娘。离别时，老太太含着热泪对服务员们说：“你们比我亲生的姑娘还亲，以后我再来北京，不住店，也要来看你们。”
    在旅社的墙壁上挂着一面“妇婴之家”的大红锦旗，这是山西阳城县七十多岁的老太太周寂惠送给旅社的。周老太太和女儿杨桂琴以及两个外孙在9月初住在这个旅社，临走的那天晚上，杨桂琴忽然要分娩，服务员四处联系，把医生请到旅社，还从别的单位借来了炉子，专为产妇做东西吃。老太太在临走时，就满怀激情地送了这面锦旗，回去后，还叮咛她在天津的儿子赶来致谢。
    大华妇婴旅社服务员树立了一切为了孩子和妈妈的服务思想，千方百计地要让旅客感到比在家还方便还温暖。她们除了代办一般旅社所有的服务项目，像代客购买用品，代购车船影剧票，代取送行李，代售邮票、信纸、信封、纸烟、茶叶等以外，还特别增添了妇婴所需要的用品和服务项目，如代卖妇女卫生用品、化装品、避孕药品、儿童玩具、糖果、点心等物品，代洗衣服、洗尿布、缝补衣服。一般饭馆没有适合孩子吃的东西，旅社就设法买了最好的小站米为孩子熬粥。设备方面也处处照顾妇婴的特殊需要，这里有专为妇婴使用的浴室和理发室，儿童活动站，小人书和妇女卫生常识等书刊。为了照顾妈妈们安心工作，白天还收托孩子。旅社内由于住的小孩多，被褥很容易脏，每天要拆洗床单、被套、枕巾六十多件，还要打扫整理三十多个房间。服务员们在“到处整洁、清新宜人，保健齐全，母子平安”的口号下，分片包干，负责到底、勤洗、勤换、勤擦、勤扫、勤整理，做到窗明几净，室室清洁。
    大华妇婴旅社的服务员们的共同特点是热爱工作，埋头苦干，公而忘私。在客房两边的走廊上，贴满了她们自己创作的诗，诗中流露出她们的愉快和热情：
    “妇婴之家是大华，招待儿童与妈妈，妇婴旅客到我社，热情招待如一家。”
    旅社成立后的两个多月中，已经有三个服务员被区妇女联合会评为多面手、巧姑娘，有两个被旅店中心店工会评为多面手。获得多面手和巧姑娘光荣称号的服务员杜桂兰，还被共青团北京市宣武区委员会评为青年红旗手。
    这个在9、10两个月内受到旅客表扬二千七百次的妇婴旅社，出席过北京市妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会。最近，她们又被评为出席全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的先进集体单位。
  人们相信在党的领导下，这样一批共产主义精神高涨的妇女们，必将取得更加优异的成绩。（附图片）
