　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 16th: The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened in Moscow on December 15th. The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Khrushchev, delivered a report at the meeting on the results of the development of Soviet agriculture over the past five years and the tasks of further increasing agricultural production.
    In his report, Khrushchev pointed out that the work of the plenary session is clearly a political summary report to the people by the Party on the state of agriculture. He emphasized the significance of the five years since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is: thanks to the measures taken by the Party, the strength of the collective farm system has been brought into play, its potential has been tapped, and the task of producing abundant agricultural products and striving for higher labor productivity in agriculture has been put forward on a realistic basis.

    **The Achievements of Developing Agriculture in the Last Five Years are Huge**

    Analyzing the path traversed in the past five years, Khrushchev said that before 1953, the state of agriculture in the Soviet Union was serious. Although the collective farms and state farms had already healed the wounds brought about by the war at that time, the level of production they had reached could not meet the needs of the country—the development of agricultural production was stagnant. Between 1948 and 1953, the total harvest and total procurement of grain did not actually increase, milk production did not increase, and the level of meat production was even lower than in 1940. The imbalance between the development of industry and agriculture hindered the further upsurge of socialist industry, hindered the improvement of the material welfare of the working people, and hindered the country's advance towards communism.

    Khrushchev reminded that in order to solve many major economic problems in developing agriculture, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union re-established the principle of materially encouraging collective farmers, sent leading cadres and experts to strengthen collective farms and state farms, and agriculture was given hundreds of thousands of tractors and millions of various machines. A new planning system was implemented, which promoted the initiative of collective farmers. Tens of millions of hectares of wasteland were reclaimed in the country, machine tractor stations were reorganized, and a new system of purchasing agricultural products was implemented.

    He said that as a result of these measures, in the entire period from 1954 to 1958, the average total output value of agricultural products each year exceeded 400 billion rubles, while it was 300 billion rubles during the period from 1949 to 1953 (calculated at comparable prices).

    **Malenkov and Others Obstructed the Development of Agriculture**

    Khrushchev said that the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov attempted to sabotage the implementation of the resolutions of the Party's September Plenary Session and the 20th National Congress, and attempted to revise the Party's Leninist general line on some fundamental issues of national development. This group has suffered a shameful defeat. These people have tried their best in recent years to oppose the implementation of major agricultural measures, thereby hindering the development of the Soviet economy. They opposed the Party's policy of land reclamation. Khrushchev said that, however, it is precisely because of the reclamation of wasteland that the production and procurement of Soviet grain have greatly increased. They opposed the new agricultural planning system, and it is precisely this new system that allows us to make more rational use of local potential.

    Khrushchev said that the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov attempted to obstruct the patriotic movement initiated by advanced collective farms and state farms in order to rapidly develop animal husbandry and catch up with the United States in terms of livestock production per capita. However, this movement has received the support of the people of the whole country and has achieved remarkable results. Members of the anti-Party group opposed the abolition of the agricultural products that collective farmers, workers, and staff sold to the state from their private economies. However, this abolition has increased the creative enthusiasm of collective farmers, and the procurement of livestock products has not only not decreased, but has greatly increased.

    Khrushchev said that Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, and others were people who did not understand agriculture. They treated farmers incorrectly and regarded them as a force resisting socialist construction. This erroneous policy of treating collective farms and collective farmers with an anti-Leninist viewpoint led in practice to the difficult situation in agriculture before 1953.

    Khrushchev pointed out that, for example, Molotov's proposal that every state should ensure self-sufficiency in potatoes and increase the total amount of national public debt in rural China once pushed collective farms to the brink of complete bankruptcy and greatly dampened the political mood of collective farmers. Many other suggestions were also put forward that actually undermined the vitality of agriculture.

    **The State Has Gained Comprehensive Economic Benefits from Land Reclamation**

    Speaking of the achievements made by the Soviet Union in increasing grain production, Khrushchev said that the total grain output in the Soviet Union this year was 8.508 billion poods, and the procurement volume was 3.5 billion poods. Harvesting so much grain is unprecedented in Soviet history. Khrushchev emphasized that this achievement is even more obvious when compared with the following situation: in grain production, the most serious backwardness was once tolerated—before 1953, the state grain harvest and yield per unit area were actually still at the level of pre-revolutionary Russia.

    Khrushchev said that Malenkov once deceived the Party and the people. He said on the podium of the Party Congress in 1952 that the total grain output in the country was 8 billion poods. In fact, the total output at that time was less than 6 billion poods (in 1952, the state purchased only 2.1 billion poods of grain). Khrushchev said that Malenkov's words were nothing more than a cover-up, the purpose of which was to conceal the huge failure in agriculture at that time entrusted to Malenkov's leadership.

    Khrushchev recalled that Molotov and other members of the anti-Party group attempted to prove that land reclamation was economically unprofitable and not worth the cost. Khrushchev said that the situation in the past few years has refuted this nonsense and proved that the country has gained comprehensive economic benefits from land reclamation. From 1954 to 1958, the total investment in land reclamation was 30.7 billion rubles. This expenditure has not only been recovered, but in this period, the country has also obtained a net income of more than 18 billion rubles. In addition, this investment in wasteland has increased the production funds of state farms, technical repair stations, and procurement organizations by about 24 billion rubles. It can be seen that land reclamation has not only been a decisive means of increasing grain production, but also an important source of accumulating national funds for realizing the program of communist construction.

    **Increasing Grain Production is Still the Main Task**

    Khrushchev emphasized that the task of increasing grain production is still the main task. To fully meet the country's consumption, about 10 billion to 11 billion poods of grain are needed each year. The decisive source of increasing grain harvest is to increase the yield per unit area of grain.

    Khrushchev also cited some figures to illustrate the increase in the output of other agricultural products. For example, during the past five-year plan period, the annual output of cotton was 3.5 million tons, and now it has increased by 717,000 tons. The Soviet Union's cotton yield per hectare is half more than that of the United States.

    Speaking of the development of animal husbandry, Khrushchev said that meat production in 1958 (slaughter weight) increased by 2.1 million tons compared with 1953, an increase of 35%, and milk production increased by 21.3 million tons, an increase of 58%.

    The number of various livestock has also increased. In 1958, the number of cattle was 69.4 million, an increase of 24% compared with 1953. During this period, the number of pigs increased by 41%, and sheep by 29%.

    The reporter said that the amount of milk that the Soviet Union can obtain in 1958 is as much as or even more than the milk production of the United States in 1957. The Soviet Union's animal oil production in 1957 was already 47,000 tons more than that of the United States. Wool production is 1.3 times more than that of the United States. The Soviet Union's total output of milk and butter ranks first in the world, and wool production ranks second in the world.

    From 1953 to 1958, the growth rate of Soviet livestock products was much faster than that of the United States.

    In his report, Khrushchev emphasized the growing role of state farms in Soviet socialist agriculture. There are now a total of 6,000 state farms in the country, with 168 million hectares of land, of which arable land accounts for 58 million hectares. Due to the reclamation of 14 million hectares of virgin and fallow land by state farms, their proportion in the production of commercial grain has increased. In 1953, they delivered only 225 million poods of grain to the state, while this year it is 1.371 billion poods, or about 40% of the total national procurement.

    Speaking of strengthening the material and technical base of agriculture, Khrushchev said that the power production capacity in agriculture has increased by half in the past five years. Now, there are a total of 1.7 million tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), about 700,000 trucks, 500,000 grain harvesting combines, 120,000 mowing combines, and millions of other agricultural machines and tools in Soviet agriculture.

    Due to the reorganization of machine tractor stations, more than 55,000 collective farms (or 81% of collective farms) have purchased agricultural technical equipment, with a total value of more than 21 billion rubles.

    Khrushchev then talked about strengthening the public economy of collective farms and improving the material welfare of collective farmers. He said that calculated into one labor force, the actual income of collective farmers in 1958 will increase by 60% compared with 1952.

    Khrushchev said that the income of collective farms and collective farmers will continue to increase with the continuous increase in the production of agricultural products by each collective farm and the entire socialist agriculture.

    Khrushchev then pointed out that the issues discussed at the Central Plenary Session are of extremely great significance to communist construction. He said that the achievements already made should become a driving force to promote the new and more vigorous development of agriculture. Speaking of the basic tasks of the seven-year plan (1959-1965) for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, Khrushchev said that collective farms will make a lot of investment—about 350 billion rubles, because the volume of commodity production will be greatly increased, and the income of farms will increase. During the seven years, the state's investment in Soviet agriculture will be 150 billion rubles.

    **Replace the Procurement System with a Free Sales and Purchase System**

    Khrushchev pointed out that the procurement system was a measure that had to be taken in the past because agricultural production had not reached a sufficient level of development. Now it can be replaced by a system of freely selling and purchasing agricultural products at prices that reflect the level of production and labor productivity.

    Khrushchev pointed out that some people are worried that the free sale of products by collective farms will bring spontaneous factors to the development of agriculture. This worry is unfounded. The state will adjust the production and prices of various products according to the people's consumption, so that collective farms have sufficient funds to accumulate for expanded reproduction. Khrushchev said that our goal is to do our best to increase the commodity rate of the economy. The development of commodity relations will make agricultural products abundant, which is one of the important conditions for the transition to communism.

    Khrushchev said that the principle of free sale of products will gradually be popularized to all sectors of the economy. Wherever agricultural products are cheap, the state will purchase them there.

    Khrushchev raised the issue of revising the collective farm's labor calculation and remuneration system to make it more perfect. He raised the issue of transitioning from the method of paying by labor days to a more advanced form of assessing the labor of collective farmers. The reporter emphasized that the initiative of collective farms should not be restricted in this regard.

    After pointing out the great achievements of Soviet agricultural science, Khrushchev said that there are still some scientific institutions that are divorced from reality. In this regard, Khrushchev suggested considering the issue of trying to link the labor remuneration of scientific workers to some extent with the results of applying scientific achievements to agricultural production. Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has never been stingy in developing science. The problem is that the funds allocated to research institutions should be used to carry out scientific research work that can provide practical help to collective farms and state farms and can promote scientific development.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏共中央全会上报告苏联农业成就和任务
    继续发展农业  改行收购制度
    今年谷物总产量达八十五亿多普特创苏联历史上空前纪录
    新华社16日讯  塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议12月15日在莫斯科开幕。苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上作了关于最近五年来苏联农业发展的结果和进一步提高农产品生产量的任务的报告。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出，全会的工作显然就是党就农业状况向人民作的政治总结报告。他强调指出了1953年中央九月全会以来的五年的意义，这个意义就是：由于党采取的措施，集体农庄制度的力量得到了施展，它的潜力发挥出来了，在现实的基础上提出了生产富裕的农产品和争取农业中更高的劳动生产率的任务。
    最近五年发展农业的成就巨大
    赫鲁晓夫在分析五年来走过的道路时说，在1953年以前，苏联的农业状况是严重的。虽然集体农庄和国营农场在那个时候已经治好了战争所带来的创伤，但是它们所达到的生产水平不能满足国家的需要——农业生产的发展停滞了。在1948年到1953年间，谷物的总收获量和总采购量实际上没有增加，牛奶的产量没有增加，肉类生产的水平比1940年还低。工农业发展不平衡的情况阻碍了社会主义工业的进一步高涨，妨碍了劳动人民物质福利的提高，妨碍了国家向共产主义推进。
    赫鲁晓夫提醒说，为了解决发展农业的许多重大的经济问题，苏联共产党重新确定了在物质上鼓励集体农民的原则，派遣了领导干部和专家去加强集体农庄和国营农场，农业获得了几十万台拖拉机和上百万台的各种各样的机器。实行了新的计划制度，这个制度发扬了集体农民的主动精神。国内开垦了数千万公顷的荒地，改组了机器拖拉机站，实行了采购农产品的新制度。
    他说，采取了这些措施的结果，在1954年到1958年整个时期，每年农产品的平均总产值超过了四千亿卢布，而1949年到1953年期间是三千亿卢布（按比较价格计算）。
    马林科夫等人阻挠了农业的发展
    赫鲁晓夫说，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫反党集团企图破坏党的九月全会和第二十次代表大会决议的实现，企图修正党在国家发展的一些根本问题上的列宁主义总路线，这个集团已经遭到了可耻的失败。这些人在最近几年以来竭力反对实现重大的农业措施，从而阻碍了苏联经济的发展。他们反对党的垦荒政策。赫鲁晓夫说，然而，正是由于开垦荒地，苏联谷物的生产和采购量都大大增加了。他们反对新的农业计划制度，而恰恰是这种新制度使我们更合理地利用了地方的潜力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫反党集团企图阻挠先进的集体农庄和国营农场为了迅速发展畜牧业、为了在按人口计算的畜产品生产方面赶上美国而倡议展开的爱国主义运动。但是，这个运动却得到了全国人民的支持，并且已经取得显著的成绩。反党集团的成员反对取消集体农民、工人和职员的自营经济交售给国家的农产品，然而，这种取消却提高了集体农民的创造积极性，畜产品的采购量不仅没有减少，反而大大增加了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，莫洛托夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫等是一些不懂农业的人，他们不正确地对待了农民，把农民看成是抵抗社会主义建设的力量。这种对待集体农庄和集体农民反列宁观点的错误方针在实践中导致了1953年以前农业方面的那种困难情况。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，例如，莫洛托夫关于每一个州应保证马铃薯自给自足和增加农村中国家公债总额的建议，曾经把集体农庄推上完全破产的境地，大大打击了集体农民的政治情绪。还提出过不少其他在实际上挫伤农业元气的建议。
    国家因开垦荒地获得了全面经济利益
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联增产谷物方面所获得的成就时说，苏联今年谷物的总产量为八十五亿零八百万普特，而采购量为三十五亿普特。收获这样多的粮食在苏联历史上是空前的。赫鲁晓夫着重指出，这种成绩与下述情况相比就显得更明显了：在谷物生产中过去曾经容忍一种最严重的落后现象——在1953年以前，国家粮食的收获量和单位面积产量实际上还停留在革命前俄国的水平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，马林科夫曾经欺骗了党和人民，他1952年在党代表大会的讲台上说，全国谷物的总产量为八十亿普特。事实上当时的总产量还不到六十亿普特（1952年国家采购的谷物只有二十一亿普特）。赫鲁晓夫说，马林科夫的话不外是一种瞒哄的做法，它的目的在于掩盖当时委托马林科夫领导的农业中所遭到的巨大失败。
    赫鲁晓夫追述说，莫洛托夫和反党集团其他成员企图证明，开垦荒地在经济上是无利的，是得不偿失的。赫鲁晓夫说，过去几年的情况已驳斥了这种无稽之谈，而且证明国家因开垦荒地而获得了全面的经济利益。从1954年到1958年，对垦荒的投资共为三百零七亿卢布。这笔开支不仅已收回了，而且在这一时期，国家还获得了一百八十亿卢布以上的纯收入。此外，靠这笔对荒地的投资，使国营农场、技术修理站和采购组织的生产基金增加了约二百四十亿卢布。由此看来，开垦荒地不仅曾经是提高谷物生产的决定性手段，而且是为实现共产主义建设纲领积累国家资金的重要来源。
    提高谷物生产仍然是主要的任务
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，提高谷物生产的任务仍然是主要的任务。要完全满足国家的消费，每年需要有大约一百亿到一百一十亿普特的粮食。增加粮食收获量的决定性来源就是提高谷物的单位面积产量。
    赫鲁晓夫还举出一些数字说明其他农产品产量的提高。例如，在过去的五年计划期间，棉花的年产量是三百五十万吨，而现在增加了七十一万七千吨。苏联每公顷的棉花产量要比美国多一半。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到发展畜牧业问题时说，1958年的肉类生产量（屠宰重）比1953年增加了二百一十万吨，即增加35％，牛奶产量增加了二千一百三十万吨，即增加58％。
    各种牲畜的数量也增加了。1958年牛的头数为六千九百四十万头，即比1953年增加24％。这一时期猪的增加数量为41％，绵羊为29％。
    报告人说，苏联1958年可以获得的牛奶量和美国1957年的牛奶产量一样多，或者还多一些。苏联的动物油生产1957年就已经比美国多四万七千吨。羊毛的生产比美国多一点三倍。苏联的牛奶和牛油的总产量占世界第一位，羊毛的产量占世界第二位。
    从1953年到1958年，苏联畜产品的增长速度比美国快得多。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中着重指出了国营农场在苏联社会主义农业中日益增长的作用。现在国内一共有六千个国营农场，拥有一亿六千八百万公顷土地，其中耕地占五千八百万公顷。由于国营农场开垦了一千四百万公顷生熟荒地，它们在商品谷物生产方面的比重增加了。1953年它们交给国家的粮食只有二亿二千五百万普特，而今年是十三亿七千一百万普特，或者说约占全国采购总额的40％。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到加强农业的物质技术基地的问题时说，农业中的动力生产能力在过去五年中增加了半倍。现在，在苏联农业中共有一百七十万台拖拉机（每台按十五匹马力计算），约七十万辆载重汽车，五十万台谷物收割联合机，十二万台割草联合机和数百万件其他农业机器和农具。
    由于改组了机器拖拉机站，现在已经有五万五千多个集体农庄（或者说81％的集体农庄）购买了农业技术设备，总值超过二百一十亿卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了关于加强集体农庄的公有经济和提高集体农民的物质福利的问题。他说，折合成一个劳动力计算，集体农民的实际收入1958年将比1952年增加60％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，集体农庄和集体农民的收入将随着每一个集体农庄以及整个社会主义农业的农产品生产不断增加而继续增加。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，中央全会上讨论的问题对共产主义建设有极其重大的意义。他说，已经取得的成绩应该成为一种动力来推动农业新的、更蓬勃的发展。赫鲁晓夫谈到发展农业和畜牧业的七年计划（1959—1965年）基本任务时说，集体农庄要作大量的投资——约三千五百亿卢布，因为商品生产量将大大提高，农庄收入将要增加。七年中国家对苏联农业的投资将为一千五百亿卢布。
    以自由售购制代替征购制度
    赫鲁晓夫指出，征购制度是过去由于农业生产发展没有达到足够的水平，而不得不采取的措施。现在可以由按照反映生产水平和劳动生产率水平的价格自由出售和收购农产品的制度来代替它了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，有人担心集体农庄自由出售产品会给农业发展带来自发的因素，这种担心是没有根据的。国家将根据人民的消费来调整各种产品的生产和价格，使集体农庄有足够的资金积累用来扩大再生产。赫鲁晓夫说，我们的目标是尽力提高经济的商品率。商品关系的发展会使农产品富裕，它是向共产主义过渡的重要条件之一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，自由出售产品的原则将逐渐普及到经济的各个部门。哪里的农产品便宜，国家就在哪里收购。
    赫鲁晓夫提出了关于修改集体农庄的劳动计算和报酬制度使其更趋完善的问题。他提出了从按劳动日支付的方式向更先进的评定集体农民劳动的形式过渡的问题。报告人着重指出，在这方面不应限制集体农庄的主动性。
    在指出苏联农业科学的巨大成就后，赫鲁晓夫说，现在还有一些脱离实际的科学机构。在这方面，赫鲁晓夫建议考虑这样一个问题，即设法在某种程度上把科学工作者的劳动报酬和运用科学成就于农业生产的结果联系起来。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府在发展科学上从不吝惜财力。问题在于，应使拨给研究机构的经费用来开展对集体农庄和国营农场有实际帮助和能推动科学向前发展的科学研究工作。
