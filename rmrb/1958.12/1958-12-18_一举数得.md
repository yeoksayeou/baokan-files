Editorial Postscript:

    Kill Two Birds with One Stone
    The Tianjin Sugar and Fruit Company organized its employees to go deep into the mountainous areas to help the local people's communes solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and transportation. They picked and transported a large number of fruits, which not only increased the supply of goods for urban consumption, but also increased the income of the local people's communes. They also used the return trips of the vehicles to help the locals transport a large number of stockpiled industrial products to grassroots stores. This is really a good method of killing two birds with one stone.
    At present, in some places, the shortage of labor and transportation has affected the entry of many agricultural and sideline products into the city and the delivery of industrial products to the countryside. Under these circumstances, how should the commercial departments treat their work? One type of person's attitude is: "There is nothing I can do if the goods are not allocated," and they can only sit and wait for the supply to come to their door. The other type of person tries every possible means within their power to overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of labor and transportation. The attitude adopted by the employees of the Tianjin Sugar and Fruit Company is this kind of attitude, and it is this kind of attitude that we need to greatly promote.

    一举数得
    天津市糖业果品公司组织职工深入山区，帮助当地人民公社解决劳动力、运输力不足的困难，采摘和运输了大批水果，既为城市消费增加了货源，又给当地人民公社增加了收入，还利用车辆回空帮助当地把积压着的大批工业品运送到基层商店去，这真是一举数得的好办法。
    现在有些地方由于劳动力、运输力紧张，影响不少农副产品进不了城，工业品下不了乡。在这种情况下，商业部门应该怎样对待自己的工作呢？一种人的态度是：“商品调拨不来我也没有办法”，只好坐等货源上门。另一种人则是在可能做到的范围内千方百计想办法去克服劳动力、运输力紧张所带来的困难。天津市糖业果品公司职工所采取的是这种态度，我们需要大大提倡的也是这种态度。
