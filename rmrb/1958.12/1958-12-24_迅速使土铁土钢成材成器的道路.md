    The Path to Rapidly Making Indigenous Iron and Steel Useful and Successful

    Following the National On-site Conference on Indigenous Iron Smelting held in Shaoyang, Hunan in August, and the National On-site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking held in Shangcheng, Henan in October, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held an on-site conference in Macheng, Hubei, on establishing small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods. If the first two conferences mainly solved the problem of popularizing "small indigenous groups," this conference mainly solved the problem of consolidating and improving "small indigenous groups," pointing out the direction of consolidation and improvement for the "small indigenous groups" movement in the iron and steel industry.

    Currently, the "small indigenous groups" on the iron and steel front are facing new situations and new tasks. The iron and steel army has already produced hundreds of thousands, millions of tons of indigenous steel and iron, playing a huge role in completing this year's steel production target ahead of schedule. The current task is how to quickly transform much of the indigenous iron and steel into steel products, machinery, and tools for direct use in production and construction. To solve this major task, we must gradually and systematically construct small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods, resolve to form a complete system of iron and steel production in the "small indigenous groups," so that indigenous iron and steel can quickly become useful materials and equipment, directly serving industrial and agricultural production and construction, and enabling us to obtain sufficient materials and equipment after the iron and steel harvest.

    Perhaps some people doubt: Can indigenous iron and steel become useful materials and equipment? Even if they can, how much use will they be? Now it is proven that this doubt is unfounded. The on-site demonstration of the Macheng Phoenix Nest Iron and Steel Plant and the exhibition hall featuring nearly four hundred kinds of equipment and products made of indigenous iron and steel at the Macheng conference powerfully and vividly demonstrated that indigenous iron and steel can not only be rolled into square steel, round steel, plate, and wire, and made into steel wire ropes, wire nails, small hardware, and other metal products, but also can be made into a variety of steel equipment needed by people's communes in rural areas for industry, agriculture, and transportation. Judging from the exhibition hall, the products of indigenous iron and steel are truly colorful and dazzling. The machinery industry needs machine tools and various machine tools, and indigenous iron and steel can make various indigenous machine tools: lathes, milling machines, planers, drills, all are possible. Industrial and agricultural production needs various power machines, and indigenous iron and steel can be made into diesel engines, locomobiles, gas engines, and can also be made into generators, motors, and transformers. Industrial and agricultural production needs to solve transportation problems, and indigenous iron and steel can be used to build indigenous railways, promote vehicle-ization, make ball bearings, make slides, build ships and repair bridges. Industry and agriculture need various machines and tools, and indigenous iron and steel can also show its magic, making indigenous textile machines, cotton gins, threshing machines, tractors, plows, harrows, shovels, hoes, etc. The construction industry needs a large amount of rebar, steel bars, steel plates, wire nails, small hardware, and steel wire, and the finished products of indigenous iron and steel are very suitable for making these things. Communication work needs to set up telephone lines and broadcast, and indigenous steel wire can just show its skills. In addition, daily necessities such as scissors, axes, knives, pliers, hammers, barbers' razors, as well as iron pots, iron spoons, and other cooking utensils, can all be made of indigenous iron and steel. This proves that using indigenous iron and steel as raw materials can completely solve a series of material and equipment problems from means of production to means of livelihood. Who says indigenous iron and steel is useless? Who says indigenous iron and steel has no future?

    Through the typical example of Macheng, it is not only proven that indigenous iron and steel is very useful, but also through this concrete typical example, the problem of how to turn indigenous iron and steel into materials and how to turn indigenous iron and steel into various appliances and machinery in the iron and steel production of "small indigenous groups" is solved. That is: self-reliance, relying on the masses, starting with small and indigenous methods, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, selecting people's communes with relatively good resources and transportation conditions, and establishing small-scale iron and steel complexes including a series of production processes such as smelting, forging steel, rolling steel, and metal products. Why have the Macheng Phoenix Nest Iron and Steel Plant and other iron and steel complexes in some places been able to establish themselves rapidly in a relatively short period? The main reason is that they adopted the policy of self-reliance and mobilizing the masses, overcoming specific difficulties such as manufacturing rolling mills, mastering technology, and lacking power.

    The Macheng First Machinery Factory took ten days to imitate and produce a "Commune" brand universal simple rolling mill. Their conditions were not good, the capacity of the melting furnace could not make large castings, there were only ten dilapidated belt lathes, and large parts could not be processed, and 80% of the workers were young workers and apprentices. But they broke superstitions, resolutely relied on themselves, mobilized the masses to find ways, and finally overcame various difficulties with indigenous methods. This fact powerfully shows that to break through the final barrier of rolling steel, forging steel, and metal products on the iron and steel front, although there are difficulties, as long as the leadership is determined and gives play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, it is not difficult to solve them.

    Some people think that this kind of small-scale iron and steel complex combining indigenous and foreign methods is too small, and cannot roll out much steel in a year, which is meaningless. Building ten rolling mills with an annual output of 10,000 tons is not as good as building one rolling mill with an annual output of 100,000 tons; moreover, the rolling mill of the Macheng Iron and Steel Plant only has an annual output of 1,000 tons? We say: This idea is one-sided and incorrect. We want to build large factories, and we are actively building them. This is the backbone of my country's iron and steel industry. However, just as a tree cannot only have a trunk without branches and leaves, and a person cannot only have large arteries without capillaries, the iron and steel industry cannot only have large factories without small factories. The output of one large factory can抵得上（dǐdéshàng - match or equal) the output of ten or even a hundred small factories; but small factories can be spread all over the country and can be built in a short period of time. Its role in promoting the development of local economy, politics, and culture cannot be replaced by large factories. The policy of simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and the policy of simultaneously developing foreign production methods and indigenous production methods, are not temporary measures, but long-term construction policies, and the reason lies in this.

    From the small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods that have been built in Macheng and other places, they play a significant role in promoting the industrialization of people's communes. Although the proportion of industry in rural areas has increased significantly compared with the past, it is still not large compared with agriculture. At present, agriculture has not yet implemented mechanization and electrification, so it is urgently needed to develop the machinery industry, chemical industry, power industry, etc., to promote the further development of agriculture. This requires first developing its own iron and steel industry under possible conditions. If a county or people's commune has its own small-scale iron and steel complex, it will have an important material basis for developing industrial and agricultural production, making the "small indigenous groups" of the iron and steel industry pave the way for the development of other industrial "small indigenous groups." For example, Macheng County needs several thousand tons of steel this year, but in reality, only 300 tons were allocated, less than 10%; now this county has built its own small steel plant with an annual output of 1,000 tons of steel, and it will soon be able to build several more such complexes next spring, which can produce several thousand tons of steel annually, making it possible to realize the county and commune's construction plans more quickly, develop industry on a large scale, and promote the technical revolution in agricultural production and transportation. This undoubtedly has great benefits for the industrialization of the county and people's commune and the entire economic development. From this, it can be seen that the establishment of this small-scale iron and steel complex combining indigenous and foreign methods is not only a problem of iron and steel production, but also a matter of the speed of industrialization of people's communes, related to agricultural mechanization and electrification, and related to the development of rural productive forces and socialist construction, that is to say, this is a major issue concerning 500 million peasants.

    The leap forward plan for doubling steel production this year has been completed ahead of schedule. To make indigenous iron and steel useful and successful, and to achieve sufficient materials and equipment, we rely entirely on walking on two legs. All regions should quickly make plans, actively implement them, and strive to build thousands of small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods!

    迅速使土铁土钢成材成器的道路
    继8月在湖南邵阳举行的全国土法炼铁现场会议、10月在河南商城举行的全国土法炼钢现场会议之后，冶金工业部最近又在湖北麻城召开了建立土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的现场会议。如果说前两个会议主要解决了“小土群”的普及问题，这次会议就主要解决了“小土群”的巩固和提高问题，给钢铁工业的“小土群”运动指出了巩固和提高的方向。
    目前，钢铁战线上的“小土群”正面临着新的形势和新的任务。钢铁大军已经炼出了数以十万、百万吨计的土钢、土铁，在提前完成今年钢产加番的任务中起了巨大的作用。目前的任务是怎样迅速使许多土铁、土钢普遍变成钢材、机器和工具，直接用到生产和建设中去。要解决这个重大的任务，就必须逐步有计划地建设土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，下定决心使“小土群”的钢铁生产形成一个完整的体系，让土铁土钢迅速成材成器，直接服务于工、农业的生产和建设，使我们继钢铁之丰收，得充足之材器。
    也许有人怀疑：土铁土钢能不能成材成器？即便能成材成器，又有多少用途？现在证明这种怀疑是没有根据的。麻城会议上麻城凤凰窝钢铁厂的现场表演和包括近四百种用土铁、土钢制成的器材产品的展览馆，有力地生动地证明了土铁、土钢不仅可以轧成方钢、圆钢、板材和线材，可以做成钢丝绳、洋钉、小五金等多种金属制品，而且可以制成广大农村人民公社工、农业及交通运输业所需用的多种钢铁器材。从展览馆看，土铁、土钢的产品真是五光十色，琳琅满目。机械工业需要工作母机和各种机床，而土铁、土钢就能做各种土机床：车、铣、刨、钻，无一不可。工、农业生产需要各种动力机械，而土铁土钢就能制成柴油机、锅驼机、煤气机，还可以做成发电机、电动机、变压器。工、农业生产需要解决交通运输问题，土铁土钢就可以用来修土铁路，搞车子化，作滚珠轴承，作滑丝，造船修桥。工业、农业需要各种机械和工具，土铁土钢也能大显神通，做土纺织机、轧花机、脱粒机、牵引机，犁、耙、锹、镢等等。建筑工业需要大量钢筋、钢条、钢板、洋钉、小五金及钢丝，而土铁土钢的成品用来做这些东西也是非常合适的。通讯工作需要架电话线，搞广播，土钢丝正好一显身手。此外，诸如日用的剪子、斧子、刀子、钳子、锤子、理发师的剃头刀，以及铁锅、铁勺等炊事用具，也无一不可以用土铁土钢做成。这就证明了用土铁土钢做原料，完全可以解决从生产资料到生活资料的一系列的材和器的问题。谁说土铁土钢没有用处？谁说土铁土钢没有前途？
    通过麻城的典型事例，不仅证明了土铁土钢大有用途，而且通过这个具体的典型事例，也解决了在“小土群”钢铁生产中如何把土铁土钢变成材，又如何把土铁土钢变成各种器具和机械的问题。这就是：自力更生，依靠群众，先从小、土上马，采用土洋结合的办法，选择资源、运输等条件比较好的人民公社，建立包括冶炼、锻钢、轧钢、金属制品等一系列生产过程的小型钢铁联合企业。麻城凤凰窝钢铁厂及其他一些地方的钢铁联合企业为什么都能在比较短的时期内迅速地建立起来呢？主要是他们采取了自力更生、发动群众的方针，克服了制造轧机、掌握技术、缺乏动力等具体困难。
    麻城第一机械厂以十天的工夫，自己仿制成了一台公社号万能简易轧钢机。他们的条件并不好，化铁炉的容量做不了大的铸件，一共只有十台破旧的皮带车床，也无法进行大件的加工，工人有80％是青工和学徒。但是他们破除迷信，坚决自力更生，发动群众想办法，终于用土办法攻破了各种难关。这个事实有力地说明，要突破钢铁战线上轧钢、锻钢、金属制品这最后一关，困难虽有，但只要领导上下了决心，发挥群众的革命干劲和创造才能，都不难得到解决。
    有些人以为，这种小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合企业太小了，一年也轧不出多少钢材来，没有什么意思。办十个年产一万吨的轧钢厂还不如办一个年产十万吨的轧钢厂；何况麻城钢铁厂的轧钢机还只年产千吨？我们说：这种想法是片面的，不正确的。大厂我们是要建设的，并且正在积极建设中，这是我国钢铁工业的骨干。但是，正同树不可只有树身而无枝叶，人不可只有大动脉而无微血管一样，钢铁工业也不可只有大厂而无小厂。大厂的产量一个能抵小厂十个、甚至百个；但小厂能遍布全国各地，能短期建成，它对于促进地方经济、政治、文化事业发展的作用，却是大厂所不能代替的。大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针不是一时的权宜之计，而是长期的建设方针，其原因就在于此。
    从麻城等已经建成的小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合企业来看，它们对于促进人民公社的工业化，有着重大的作用。现在农村中工业的比重虽比过去有了突出的增加，但比起农业来，比重还是不大的。而目前农业还没有实行机械化、电气化，所以也迫切地需要发展机械工业、化学工业、动力工业等等，来促进农业的进一步发展。这就需要在可能的条件下首先发展自己的钢铁工业。一个县或人民公社如果有了自己的小型钢铁联合企业，就有了发展工、农业生产的重要物质基础，使钢铁工业的“小土群”为发展其他工业的“小土群”开辟道路。例如麻城县今年需要几千吨钢材，但实际上只分配到三百吨，不到10％；现在这个县自己建起了一个年产千吨钢材的小钢铁厂，而且明年春天很快还可再建几个这样的联合企业，可以年产几千吨钢材，这就有可能更快地实现县和公社的建设规划，大量发展工业，促成农业生产和交通运输方面的技术革命。这无疑对县和人民公社的工业化和整个经济发展有莫大的好处。由此可见，建立这种小型、土洋结合的钢铁联合企业，不仅是一个钢铁生产的问题，而是关系到人民公社工业化的速度问题，关系到农业机械化、电气化，关系到农村生产力发展和社会主义建设的问题，也就是说，这是一个关系五亿农民的重大问题。
    今年钢产加番的跃进计划已经提前完成了，让土铁土钢成材成器，做到材多器足，全靠用两条腿走路。各地应迅速做出规划，积极付诸实施，为建设千百个土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业而奋斗！
