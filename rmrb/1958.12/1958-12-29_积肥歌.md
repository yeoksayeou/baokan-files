Fertilizer Accumulation Song

    One. Who says there are many stars in the sky? There are more manure pits underground. The stars in the sky are all scattered, the manure pits underground are as dense as sieves. People depend on grain, the land depends on fertilizer, one bucket of manure water brings a basket of grain. This year, fertilizer is piled into mountains, next year, grain will flow like a river.

    Two. In previous years, there were few methods for accumulating fertilizer, but this year there are many tricks for accumulating fertilizer. Livestock pens are made smaller and moved to the fields, pig farmers move to the hillsides. Dig pits at the edge of the fields to accumulate fertilizer, combining weeding and accumulating fertilizer. Accumulate it on the spot and use it on the spot, saving labor and increasing output.

    积肥歌
    一谁说天上星星多？那有地下粪坑多。天上星星个挨个，地下粪坑密如箩。人靠粮食地靠肥，一桶粪水粮一箩，今年肥料堆成山，明年粮食流成河。
    二往年积肥办法少，今年积肥窍门多。畜圈化小搬田间，猪户迁移上山坡。地头挖坑就积肥，结合拔草积肥多。就地积来就地用，又省工来又出活。
    ——辽宁民歌——
