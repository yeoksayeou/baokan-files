    Improve Labor Management to Achieve Production Plans
    --Before and After the Improvement of Labor Management in Xialiang Farm, Zhanglan Commune
    Wen Shan, Liang Yi, Yan Ru
    Starting with Zhang Yongxin's Manure Collection
    The commune member Zhang Yongxin still got up at dawn and collected manure inside and outside the village, just like he used to. Unexpectedly, some people started to ridicule him: "What are you picking those manure pellets for? Now that work points aren't even being recorded, why are you still so active?"
    This story took place in Xialiang Farm of Zhanglan People's Commune in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province. Xialiang Farm was originally an advanced cooperative. All one hundred and fifty-nine households of commune members competed with each other in labor. After the establishment of Zhanglan People's Commune on September 8th this year, it was announced that a distribution system combining wages and supply would be implemented. For a time, methods such as scoring and recording work were no longer implemented, and the work attitude of commune members became uneven. The majority of commune members were overjoyed with the establishment of the commune and the implementation of the food supply system, and they worked even harder than before without worrying about how much they were paid. However, a small number of commune members did not work properly. Some people even said: "Do more or do less as you please, anyway, you can eat in the canteen after work." Under such circumstances, the farm's labor attendance rate dropped from 95% in the past to 70%.
    In the past, there were scoring and work-point recording systems and labor quotas, and there were rules to follow in labor management, but now there was no way to implement them. Some pretended to be sick and slept, while others took advantage of the excuse of "visiting relatives" and left for dozens of days at a time. Many cadres were worried that production would be affected and were very anxious about this.
        Two Attitudes
    Changing the chaotic situation in labor management was the common demand of all cadres and masses in the farm. Everyone thought: The farm is a basic production unit of the People's Commune, and its main task is to do a good job in labor management and achieve the commune's production plan. How can we complete the production plan if we don't change this chaotic situation? However, there were very different understandings of what methods should be adopted to solve this problem.
    Some people strongly advocated adopting "tough policies" towards commune members who had poor work attitudes and using "systems" to "control" them. Wang Ru-yuan, the captain of the second production team, was a typical example. When the female commune member Liu Ming-ying did not work hard, the farm manager Huang Jing-san called her in and asked her if she had any difficulties, and conducted ideological mobilization work on her. Wang Ru-yuan believed that this was an undesirable "kowtow policy." He advocated that "whoever doesn't work hard, give him something hard to eat!" Every time the farm manager talked to someone, he would go back and "make up the lesson": "The farm manager said nice things to you, but I don't have any nice things to say. You remember, you can't do this in our team!"
    Opposed to this kind of person were those who advocated democratic management. They believed that after the distribution method was changed, it was still necessary to establish some necessary systems in labor management. However, relying solely on systems could not solve all the problems. It was necessary to vigorously strengthen political work in the farm, conscientiously implement the democratic management system, and constantly improve the commune members' communist consciousness and work enthusiasm. As for relying on coercion and commandism, they believed that it was even more of a "failure to accomplish anything and ruin everything" approach.
    Therefore, under the leadership of the farm's Party branch, a debate was launched on these two diametrically opposed opinions. As soon as the debate began, many people refuted their arguments with facts. For example, they said: "Some people can't be transformed without struggle sessions." Everyone said that if ideological problems cannot be solved, struggle is useless. People who advocated relying on coercion and commandism also said: "The reason why some people are not working hard now is not due to poor management, but because there is a problem with the distribution system." Everyone said that political leadership is the soul, and without political work, nothing can be accomplished. In the past, when scoring and recording work points were implemented, mutual supervision was required in labor. Now that a wage system plus a supply system has been implemented, mutual supervision must be further strengthened. If we don't rely on everyone to manage everyone, how can we rely on just a few cadres in the farm! After several fierce debates, those who advocated relying on coercion and commandism admitted their mistakes.
          Democratic Management in a Single Line
    A farm is not the same as an agricultural cooperative in the past. How should it establish its own democratic management system? After the cadres unified their thinking, they decided to boldly explore and create. The farm established a farm affairs committee composed of eleven people to specifically lead this work. The comprehensive improvement of management work was quickly carried out step by step.
    Based on the requirements of the commune, they first divided all two hundred and forty-nine male, female, full, half, and auxiliary laborers in the farm into grades according to three conditions: work attitude, physical strength, and technical skill. This was done through self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic decision-making. Commune members of different grades enjoyed different wages according to the unified regulations of the commune. Then, based on the local situation, they democratically stipulated the number of workdays that various laborers should work each year, calculating: male full and half laborers should work three hundred and thirty-four days per year, female full and half laborers two hundred and ninety-seven days, and male auxiliary laborers two hundred and ninety-eight days.
    Having attendance requirements does not mean that everyone can implement them. What to do? They came up with a method of attendance boards. Attendance boards were set up in the two public canteens of the farm's two production teams. At a glance, you could see who was present and who was absent. In order to understand who met the attendance requirements during the year and who did not, the farm also developed an attendance register. Each team had one attendance register, which was recorded daily by the team's statistician. Attendance was marked with a circle, leave was marked with the word "leave," and unjustified absence was marked with a line. In this way, the problem of checking attendance was solved.
    How to ensure labor efficiency and labor quality? When studying how to solve this problem, there were two opinions: one was to engage in labor quotas, and the other was to rely on political leadership and democratic supervision. After repeated research and comparison of the two opinions, it was decided to use a series of political measures such as "honor rolls," "hero platforms," and "merit and demerit books" to solve the problem. Each team established an "honor roll," stipulating that good people and good deeds that emerged in labor every day should be written on the honor roll in a timely manner, and then copied into the merit and demerit book. A "three evaluations" (evaluating merit, evaluating demerit, and evaluating models) day was held every month, and the commune members with the most mentions on the honor roll were rated as heroes and written on the hero platform, to be retained for one month. The farm also decided to extract 10% of the total wage amount as bonus wages. When adjusting grades and issuing bonus wages, the records on the merit and demerit book and the hero platform were the main basis. In order to facilitate commune members to carry out mutual supervision and mutual competition, the farm also established big-character poster columns and competition columns, requiring commune members to make criticisms, praises, and challenges to the people around them anytime and anywhere.
    In the process of improving the farm's labor management work, commune members unanimously requested that various responsibility systems be adhered to. The farm cadres felt that this was a good system for carrying out democratic management, so they accepted everyone's suggestions, divided responsibility areas according to production teams, divided responsibility plots according to work groups, and divided responsibility plots for commune members, clarifying production responsibilities. In addition to the two agricultural production teams, the farm also established an economic crop production group and a sideline production group. The commune members participating in these two groups also clearly stipulated their responsibilities.
    After various systems in management work were established, in order to make democratic management institutionalized and regular, the farm determined that special personnel should be responsible and also formulated a production management regulation. At this point, the farm's democratic management work formed a single line.
      Everyone is the Master, Labor is Energetic
    Less than twenty days after Xialiang Farm improved its labor management work, the chaotic phenomenon of the past was overcome, and the entire farm was filled with a new atmosphere.
  "Break the middle reaches, strive for the upper reaches, and never give up until we reach the upper reaches." It has become a common practice for commune members to strive for advancement in labor. The number of commune members on the honor roll is increasing day by day, the friendly competition is becoming more and more intense, and the labor attendance rate has rapidly increased from 70% in the past to 100%. Everyone reflects that with political leadership, they are full of energy.
    "Management democratization, commune members are energetic." This is an important experience of the farm cadres after realizing democratic management. Those who were worried about "political leadership being a gust of wind" and "democratic management being an empty show" have all improved their awareness in the face of facts. Wang Ru-yuan, the captain of the second team, said: "In the past, chasing sparrows was difficult, but now everyone is attending work except when they are sick. Democratic management is truly invaluable, and the cadres have less to worry about." Li Ai-yu, Wang Fu-chen, and other cadres who used to have rigid work styles have now changed and consult with commune members on everything, and no longer scold people when talking about work with commune members.
    At present, all the cadres and commune members of the farm are working together and are vigorously engaging in winter production. (Originally published in Shanxi Daily)

    搞好劳动管理  实现生产计划
    ——张兰公社下梁农场改善劳动管理前后
    文珊  梁毅  燕如
    从张永信拾粪谈起
    社员张永信还和往日一样，天刚明就起来到村里村外拾粪。想不到有些人讥笑起他来了：“你拾那粪蛋蛋做甚？现在连工分都不记了，你为甚还那样积极？”
    这段故事发生在山西介休县张兰人民公社的下梁农场。下梁农场原来是一个高级社。全社一百五十九户社员，在劳动方面，一个赛一个。今年9月8日，张兰人民公社成立，宣布实行工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度以后，一时评分记工等办法都不再执行，社员们的劳动态度就参差不齐了。大部分社员对成立公社，实行伙食供给制，欣喜若狂，劳动起来不计较报酬多少，比过去更加卖力气。另外有少数社员却不好好干活了。有些人甚至说：“做多做少自由干，反正下工食堂能吃饭。”在这种情况下，全场的劳动出勤率，由过去的95％下降到70％。
    过去有评分记工和劳动定额等制度，劳动管理有规可循，现在无法可施了。有的装病睡觉，有的借“走亲戚”之名，一走数十天。许多干部担心生产受到影响，都为这事非常着急。
        两种态度
    改变劳动管理上的混乱状况，是全场干部和群众的共同要求。大家想：农场是人民公社一个基层生产单位，它的主要任务就是搞好劳动管理，实现全社的生产计划。不改变这股混乱劲儿，怎能完成生产计划呢？但对于解决这个问题应采取什么方法，认识却很不一致。
    有一种人，他们极力主张对劳动态度不好的社员采用“强硬政策”，用“制度”“卡”他们。第二生产队队长王汝元，就是典型代表。女社员刘明英不好好劳动，场长黄敬三把她叫来，问她是不是有什么困难，对她进行思想动员工作，王汝元便认为这是要不得的“磕头政策”。他主张“谁不好好劳动，就给他些硬家伙吃！”场长给谁谈了话，他回头都要去“补课”：“场长给你说好话，我可没有好听的，你记住，到咱们队里可不能这样！”
    和这种人对立的，是主张实行民主管理。他们认为分配办法改变以后，在劳动管理方面，建立一些必要的制度，还是需要的。但是光靠制度并不能全部解决问题，必须大力加强农场里的政治工作，认真贯彻民主管理制，不断地提高社员的共产主义觉悟和劳动积极性。至于靠强迫命令办事，他们认为那更是一种“成事不足，坏事有余”的做法。
    于是，在农场党支部的领导下，这两种针锋相对的意见开展了辩论。辩论一开始，许多人都通过事实来反驳他们的论点。如他们说：“不上斗争会，有些人就转变不了。”大家说，解决不了思想问题，斗争也不顶用。主张靠强迫命令的人又说：“现在有些人不好好劳动，不是管理不善，而是分配制度上有毛病。”大家说，政治挂帅是灵魂，没有政治工作，就一事无成。过去实行评分记工，劳动中需要进行相互监督。现在实行了工资制加供给制，互相监督就更得加强。要是不依靠大家来管理大家，光靠农场几个干部，那怎能行呢！经过几次激烈的辩论，主张靠强迫命令的人才承认了自己的错误。
          民主管理一条龙
    一个农场和过去的一个农业社并不相同，它应该怎样建立自己的民主管理制度呢？干部们的思想统一之后，决定大胆摸索、创造。场里建立起由十一人组成的场务委员会，专门领导这一工作。管理工作的全面改进，很快就一步一步地搞起来了。
    依据公社的要求，他们首先按劳动态度、体力强弱和技术高低等三个条件，通过自报公议、民主定案的办法，把全场二百四十九个男女全半辅助劳力，划分了等级。不同等级的社员，按公社统一规定，享受高低不同的工资。接着，他们又根据本地的情况，民主规定出各种劳动力每年的出勤数目，计：男全半劳力，每年应出勤三百三十四天，女全半劳力二百九十七天，男辅助劳力二百九十八天。
    有了出勤要求，并不等于大家都能执行。怎么办呢？他们想出了出勤牌的办法。在全场两个生产队的两个公共食堂里，都设置了出勤牌。一看便知谁出勤，谁缺勤。为了了解一年中间，究竟哪些人达到出勤要求，哪些人达不到，场里又制订了考勤簿。考勤簿一队一本，由各队统计员逐日登记。出勤的划圈圈，请假的写假字，无故缺勤的划杠杠。这样一来，考查出勤的问题就解决了。
    劳动效率和劳动质量如何保证呢？在研究解决这问题时，有两种意见：一种是主张搞劳动定额，一种是主张靠政治挂帅和民主监督。两种意见经过反复研究对比之后，决定用“光荣榜”、“英雄台”、“功过簿”等一系列的政治措施来解决。每队都建立了一个“光荣榜”，规定每天在劳动中涌现出来的好人好事，都要及时写在光荣榜上，然后再誉抄在功过簿里。每月举行一次“三评”（评功、评过、评模范）日，把上光荣榜次数最多的社员评为英雄，写在英雄台上，保留一月。场里并决定抽工资总额中的10％，作为奖励工资。在调整级别和颁发奖励工资时，功过簿、英雄台上的记录是主要依据。为了便于社员群众开展相互监督和相互竞赛，场里还建立了大字报栏和竞赛栏，要求社员们随时随地地对自己周围的人，提出批评、表扬和挑战。
    在改善场内劳动管理工作的过程中，社员们一致要求坚持执行各种责任制。场干部们觉得这是进行民主管理的好制度，便接受了大家的建议，按生产队划分了责任地区，按作业小组划分了责任地片，社员划分了责任地块，生产责任分明。除两个农业生产队外，农场还成立了一个经济作物生产组，一个副业生产组。参加这两个组的社员，也都明确规定了自己的责任。
    管理工作上的各种制度确立以后，为了使民主管理制度化、经常化，场里确定了专人负责，还制订出一个生产管理条例。至此，全场民主管理工作形成了一条龙。
      人人当家  劳动劲大
    下梁农场改进劳动管理工作还不到二十天，过去那种混乱现象便得到克服，全场到处充满了新气象。
  “破中游、争上游，不达上游不罢休。”社员在劳动中争先进，已成为一种普遍的风气，上光荣榜的社员一天比一天多，友谊竞赛一天比一天开展的炽烈，劳动出勤率已由过去的70％，迅速提高为百分之百。大家纷纷反映说，政治挂了帅，浑身都是劲。
    “管理民主化，社员干劲大。”这是场干部在实现民主管理以后的重要体会。过去耽心“政治挂帅一股风”、“民主管理一场空”的人，在事实面前，都提高了觉悟。第二队队长王汝元说：“过去是撵雀撵不动，现在是除过生病，人人都出勤。民主管理真是无价宝，当干部的歇心的多了。”李爱玉、王甫臣等几个原来作风生硬的干部，现在也都转变的遇事就和社员商量，和社员们谈工作时，再不一说三瞪眼了。
    目前，全场干部和社员拧成一股劲，正在大闹冬季生产。  （原载山西日报）
