Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Fourth National Congress of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has closed on the 2nd. The congress opened on November 12th and lasted for twenty-five days including the preparatory meeting. During the congress, the representatives launched a great airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, and conducted criticism and self-criticism. One hundred and twenty-one people spoke at the congress, and more than one thousand one hundred big-character posters were put up.

Before the closing of the congress, the representatives unanimously adopted the revised Constitution of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. The new constitution embodies the new tasks of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang under the current new situation at home and abroad, further clarifies the nature and role of the Revolutionary Committee, and emphasizes the political direction of sincerely accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China and resolutely taking the socialist road.

The resolution adopted by the congress pointed out that the general policy and fundamental task of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in the future is to "continue to deepen the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, carry out fundamental transformation of organizations and individuals, break the capitalist stand, establish a socialist stand, actively participate in the technological revolution and cultural revolution, and strive to serve socialism." The resolution pointed out that the ways and methods for self-transformation of members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang are "under the leadership of the Communist Party, taking political and ideological education as the commander, taking socialist work posts as the base, taking labor practice and professional practice as the foundation, learning the noble qualities of workers and peasants, studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism."

The resolution of the congress expressed firm support for the policies and guidelines of the Communist Party of China and the government on opposing American imperialist aggression and liberating Taiwan.

Li Jishen delivered the closing speech at the end of the congress. He said that this congress "is a congress where socialist ideology once again triumphs over capitalist ideology, a congress of unity on the basis of unified and improved political and ideological understanding, and a congress to encourage hard work, strive for the top, and promote the fundamental socialist transformation of the entire party." Li Jishen also pointed out that this congress has set a new milestone for the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on the long road of transforming itself into a political force that truly serves socialism.

Li Jishen then talked about the issue of liberating Taiwan. He pointed out that the great Chinese people will surely be able to break through any obstruction and sabotage by American imperialism, return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland, and realize the complete reunification of the motherland. He said: "The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan are all Chinese, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. We hope that they can recognize their dangerous situation, put the interests of the nation first, carry forward the patriotic and anti-imperialist spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and join us in opposing the common enemy of the Chinese people, American imperialism."

In his report, Li Jishen once again emphasized that sincerely accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the political direction of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. He said that this congress "has made our direction clearer and our eyes brighter. The Communist Party of China is our direction, is our lighthouse. Sincerely accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and always following the Communist Party, we will be able to control our own destiny, lead our members and the masses we are connected with to advance along the bright road, contribute the strength of our party to the glorious and great socialist cause and communist cause, and make our party continuously adapt to the needs of the new society and play its due role."

Before the closing of the congress, Li Jishen and others were elected as 132 members of the Fourth Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Ding Yichen and others were elected as 43 alternate central committee members.
