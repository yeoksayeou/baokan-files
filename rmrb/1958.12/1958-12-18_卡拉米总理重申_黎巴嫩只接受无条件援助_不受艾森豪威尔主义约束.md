Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 16th. Lebanese Prime Minister Karami, in a private interview with a reporter from the Cairo newspaper "Al-Akhbar," reiterated that "Lebanon is no longer bound by the Eisenhower Doctrine."

Karami's remarks, published in today's "Al-Akhbar," stated, "We have announced that we are no longer bound by the Eisenhower Doctrine. The aid we have accepted and will accept in the future will be without strings and without conditions. In short, the Eisenhower Doctrine does not exist in Lebanon, and we have notified the United States of this."

He added, "Lebanon pursues a policy of neutrality and non-alignment. We will not allow any foreign country to have privileged status in our country, and we will not accept any military treaties or plans."

When asked about his meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree, Karami said that he had spoken to Rountree about the "mistakes" made by the United States in its relations with Arab countries and expressed the hope that the Americans would take it as a lesson.

He also said that in his ninety-minute meeting with Rountree, he told Rountree that the United States should be held responsible for not implementing the UN resolutions of 1947, 1948, and 1949 on the Palestine issue.

Regarding the dissolution of parliament, he said that he still believes it is necessary to dissolve the parliament elected under the premiership of former Prime Minister Solh, but the current situation is not suitable for holding new elections. Electoral districts must be adjusted.

He added that his government is eager to eliminate people's animosity and restore domestic security.

    卡拉米总理重申
    黎巴嫩只接受无条件援助
    不受艾森豪威尔主义约束
    新华社开罗16日电  黎巴嫩总理卡拉米在单独接见开罗“消息报”记者时重申，“黎巴嫩不再受艾森豪威尔主义的约束”。
    “消息报”今天刊载的卡拉米的谈话说，“我们已经宣布，我们现在不再受艾森豪威尔主义的约束。我们已经接受的和将来要接受的援助都将是没有束缚的和不附加条件的。总之，艾森豪威尔主义在黎巴嫩是不存在的，我们已经把这点通知了美国。”
    他又说，“黎巴嫩奉行中立和不结盟的政策。我们不会让任何一个外国在我们国家占有特权地位，我们不会接受任何军事条约或计划。”
    记者问到他同美国助理国务卿朗特里的会谈时，卡拉米说，他对朗特里谈到了美国在同阿拉伯国家的关系上所犯的“错误”，并且表示希望美国人会把它当作一个教训。
    他还说，他在同朗特里的九十分钟的会谈中还对朗特里说，美国应对没有执行联合国1947年、1948年和1949年关于巴勒斯坦问题的决议负责。
    关于解散议会问题，他说，他仍然认为有必要解散由前总理索勒哈主持选出的议会，但目前的情况不适宜于举行新的选举。选区必须加以调整。
    他又说，他的政府迫切希望消除人们的仇恨情绪和恢复国内安全。
