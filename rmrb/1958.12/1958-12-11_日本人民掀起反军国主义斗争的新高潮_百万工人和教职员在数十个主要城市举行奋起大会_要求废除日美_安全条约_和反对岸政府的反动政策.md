Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th dispatch: A struggle action involving one million workers and teachers launched simultaneously across the country today by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japan Teachers' Union opposes the Kishi Nobusuke government's re-submission of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to the Diet, demands the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demands the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, demands the issuance of year-end bonuses, the abolition of the "performance rating" system, and opposes illegal suppression.

They held rallies in about fifty major cities across the country. At the same time, teachers' unions from Hokkaido to Kyushu held various gatherings, and the All Monopoly Corporation Labor Union and the All Forestry Agency Labor Union also held legal struggles and workplace rallies.

In Tokyo, more than 15,000 people, mainly members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Teachers' Union, held the 6th Joint Struggle Central General Rally at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Concert Hall.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's re-submission of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to the Diet. The resolution stated that they will launch a resolute struggle to demand the dissolution of the Diet, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and strive to establish a government that upholds peace, democracy, and is loyal to the people.

The conference also passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The resolution pointed out that only by abolishing the "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" and promoting the withdrawal of U.S. troops and U.S. military bases stationed in Japan can Japan move towards independence and peace. The resolution firmly stated that they will launch a struggle even stronger than the opposition to the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" in order to crush the conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty."

The conference also passed six resolutions demanding the abolition of the "performance rating" system, the cancellation of illegal punishments against workers participating in the struggle, and the immediate ratification of the International Labor Organization conventions; demanding the establishment of a social security system and the realization of full employment, opposing unemployment; launching a struggle to strive for higher wages, determine minimum wages, and pay year-end bonuses; in order to maintain local autonomy, demanding the establishment of a local financial system; and opposing the increase in private railway fares and various commodity prices.

The conference unanimously adopted a declaration, firmly stating that in order to realize the above demands, they will join hands with people from all walks of life to launch a struggle and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

After the conference, all participants held a large-scale lantern parade on the streets.

Teachers in Gunma Prefecture held a one-day leave struggle today. Teachers in Kyoto Prefecture, Yamagata Prefecture, and Niigata City stopped classes from this afternoon and held rallies demanding the return of "performance evaluation reports" and the cancellation of punishments against teachers. In negotiations that began at midnight yesterday, the Fukuoka Prefectural Teachers' Union forced the Fukuoka City Board of Education to recognize the "performance evaluation reports" that middle and elementary school principals were forced to fill out as invalid. This education committee locked up middle and elementary school principals in Fukuoka City yesterday and forced them to fill out "performance evaluation reports" for teachers. The Fukuoka Prefectural Teachers also held a rally this afternoon to protest the "performance rating" system. After the meeting, they sent representatives to hold collective negotiations with the education committees of various cities, towns, and villages, demanding that "performance evaluation reports" not be submitted.

Under strong demands from workers, the Japan National Railways and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation have been forced to agree to pay employees year-end bonuses equivalent to 1.9 months' salary.

Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Toyoo Terao has repeatedly and arrogantly threatened the All Communications Workers' Union not to participate in joint struggles, and has issued warnings to union leaders.

    在工人的强烈要求下，日本国营铁道公司和电信电话公社已经被迫同意发给职工相当于一点九个月的年终津贴。
