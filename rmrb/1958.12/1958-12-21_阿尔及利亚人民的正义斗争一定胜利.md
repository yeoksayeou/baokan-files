    The Algerian People's Just Struggle Will Surely Triumph
    —Speech at the United Arab Republic Ambassador's Reception for the Algerian Government Delegation—
    Ambassador Ragab's Speech
    Your Excellency the Premier, Your Excellencies, Dear Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Today, we are very honored to welcome the delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria here. They came to China at the invitation of the Chinese Government and to strengthen the fraternal relations that exist harmoniously between the two countries.

    The importance of the leaders gathered with us tonight is linked to the great mission they are promoting, a great mission that is deeply rooted in the land of the brave country they come from—Algeria.

    The heroic Algerian people are writing the most glorious page in the history of the anti-imperialist struggle in order to win independence and liberate themselves from the reign of terror imposed on them by French imperialists for nearly a century. During this period, French imperialism tried its best to incorporate Algeria, a pure Arab country, into the French territory, eliminate its original Arabic language, and eradicate its deep-rooted traditional relationship with Arab history.

    However, the will of the Algerian people has never been weakened. In the five long years, they have been fighting hard against French imperialism for the independence of their motherland. On average, one out of every eighteen people has sacrificed themselves, thus setting the best example of self-sacrifice to the world.

    French imperialists recruited 500,000 troops equipped with the latest weapons supplied by other imperialist countries and the North Atlantic aggressive organization, thinking that this would extinguish the Algerian revolution. However, they were disappointed, because the power of the people cannot be subdued by these weapons, no matter how destructive these weapons are.

    Today, the heroic Algerian people are recording the epic of freedom on the rocks of the Atlas Mountains with their own blood for the first time. A country that has produced Ben Bella, Jamila Bouhired, and Jamila Bou Isha is undoubtedly unconquerable.

    The Algerian people have won great sympathy from all the people who have been exploited by colonialism in their heroic struggle. Standing at the forefront of these people is the great Chinese people. Because the Chinese people have always supported Algeria and immediately recognized the new Algerian Provisional Government after its establishment.

    The people of Asia and Africa have awakened from years of slumber and have begun to record their own history again. Due to the great unity of Asian and African countries, imperialism is suffering a series of defeats. The independence of Algeria will mark a new stage in the anti-imperialist struggle of oppressed countries. In the near future, imperialism will find that they must get out of Africa as they did before out of Asia.

    We express our gratitude to the Chinese government for inviting the respectable representatives of the Algerian Provisional Government to visit China. We are convinced that this visit will strengthen the friendship between the great Chinese people and the Arab people, especially the Algerian people.

    Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

    Please allow me to propose a toast:
    To the great achievements of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong!
    To Asian-African solidarity!
    To the heroic Algerian people!
    To the health of His Excellency Abbas Ferhat, Prime Minister of the Algerian Provisional Government!
    To the health of our dear guests!
    To world peace!

    Minister Heda's Speech
    Your Excellency Ambassador Ragab of the United Arab Republic, Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, Your Excellency Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    On behalf of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, I deeply thank His Excellency the Ambassador of the United Arab Republic for holding this friendly reception full of fraternal feelings. The people of the United Arab Republic and the Government of the United Arab Republic, headed by President Gamal Abdel Nasser, have been helping the Algerian people who are fighting for freedom and independence. Our people believe in their rights and also believe that they will achieve the final victory over the forces of imperialism.

    The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is very happy for the sympathy it has received from the Chinese people and their government. This strengthens the solidarity between the Arab people and the Chinese people on the one hand, and the solidarity between the Arab people and the socialist countries on the other. The Arabs have not forgotten that this solidarity and the support of all peace-loving countries stopped the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt in 1956 and also crushed the US-British attack on the Iraqi revolution. This situation is a victory for world peace. There is no doubt that the victory of the people of Asia and Africa is approaching.

    Long live Asian-African solidarity!
    Long live the friendship between the great Chinese people and the Arab people!
    Long live world peace!
    Cheers to the health of all the diplomatic envoys present today!

    Vice Premier Chen Yi's Speech
    Your Excellency Respected Ambassador Ragab, Respected Distinguished Guests of the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Today, I am very happy to be able to gather again with the distinguished guests of the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria at the reception held by His Excellency Ambassador Ragab.

    The Algerian people's struggle against French imperialism is an integral part of the Arab people's and the African people's anti-imperialist struggle. The heroic struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic, the Iraqi people, and the Algerian people has demonstrated the indomitable heroism of the Arab people and the African people, and has greatly promoted the anti-imperialist struggle in this region. The successful conclusion of the All-African People's Conference in Accra a few days ago marked the vigorous development of the African national independence movement. We are pleased to see that the Arab people and the Asian and African people are closely united in the common struggle against imperialism. The Arab people and the Asian and African people, especially the government and people of the United Arab Republic, have given strong support to the Algerian people, which has greatly encouraged the Algerian people to persist in the armed struggle against French imperialism.

    The Algerian people's struggle is also an integral part of the struggle of the people of the world for peace and against war. Therefore, it is not only supported by the Arab people and the Asian and African people, but also by socialist countries and peace-loving countries and people. The recent vote on the Algerian issue at the United Nations General Assembly fully proves this. As a result of this vote, only eighteen countries voted against it. This shows that Algeria's international prestige is growing, and it also once again confirms the situation that the East wind prevails over the West wind. Algeria, the United Arab Republic, and all countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are striving for and safeguarding national independence, and the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are all places where the East wind blows. In today's era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, we believe that the Algerian people will surely receive more and more support from countries and people, and will surely be able to defeat the French aggressors supported by US imperialism.

    The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria is about to successfully conclude its visit to China. The joint communique signed just now shows that our two countries have reached a consensus on some issues of common interest. We believe that your visit will greatly promote the friendly relations between our two countries and mutual support in the common struggle.

    I propose:
    To the victory of the Algerian people,
    To the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people,
    To the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Arab countries,
    To the great unity of the Asian and African people,
    To world peace,
    To the health of His Excellency President Nasser of the United Arab Republic,
    To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria,
    To the health of the distinguished guests of the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria,
    To the health of His Excellency Ambassador Ragab, the host of today's reception, and his wife,
    Cheers!

    阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争一定胜利
    —在阿联大使招待阿尔及利亚政府代表团酒会上的讲话—
    拉加卜大使的讲话总理阁下，诸位阁下，亲爱的来宾们，女士们、先生们：
    今天我们在这里欢迎阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团，感到非常荣幸。他们来到中国是应了中国政府的邀请，也是为了加强两国间融洽地存在着的兄弟关系。
    今晚和我们欢聚一堂的领袖们，他们的重要性是和他们所宣扬的伟大使命联系在一起的，这种伟大的使命是根深蒂固地生长在他们来自的那个勇敢的国家——阿尔及利亚的国土上的。
    英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，为了争取独立和从近百年来法帝国主义者强加在他们头上的恐怖统治中获得解放，正在反帝斗争的历史上写下最光辉的一页。在此期间，法帝国主义曾竭力企图把纯真的阿拉伯国家——阿尔及利亚并入法国版图，消灭它原有的阿拉伯语言，根除它与阿拉伯历史深远的传统关系。
    但是，阿尔及利亚人民的意志从来就没有被削弱过，在五年漫长的岁月中为了争取祖国的独立，他们坚苦奋勇地和法帝国主义斗争着，平均每十八个人就牺牲一人，因而向全世界作出了一个自我牺牲的最好的模范。
    法帝国主义者招募了五十万军队配备着由其他帝国主义国家和北大西洋侵略组织所供应的最新式武器，以为这样就能把阿尔及利亚的革命扑灭掉。然而他们是失望了，因为人民的力量决不是这些武器所能屈服的，不管这些武器的毁灭性如何强大。
    英勇的阿尔及利亚人民今天正在用自己的鲜血在阿特拉斯山的岩石上第一次记载着自由的史诗。这样一个曾产生过本·贝拉·加米拉·卜·哈里德，和加米拉·卜·伊沙的国家无疑是不可征服的。
    阿尔及利亚人民在英勇的斗争中获得全世界一切曾受到殖民主义剥削的人民的极大同情。站在这些人民最前列的就是伟大的中国人民。因为中国人民一直在支持阿尔及利亚，并且在新阿尔及利亚临时政府成立后便立即承认了它。
    亚非人民已经从多年的酣睡中觉醒了，重新开始在记载自己的历史。由于亚非国家的大团结，帝国主义正遭到一连串的失败。阿尔及利亚的独立将会在被压迫国家的反帝斗争中标志着一个新的阶段。不久的将来，帝国主义就会发现他们必须像以前滚出亚洲一样滚出非洲。
    我们对邀请阿尔及利亚临时政府可敬的代表们来华访问的中国政府表示感谢。我们确信，这次访问会加强伟大的中国人民和阿拉伯人民，尤其是和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友谊。
    诸位阁下、女士们、先生们，
    请允许我为在毛泽东主席英明领导下的中国人民的伟大成就，
    为亚非团结，
    为英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，
    为阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯·法拉哈特阁下的健康，
    为我们亲爱的来宾的健康，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
    赫达部长的讲话阿拉伯联合共和国拉加卜大使阁下，中华人民共和国国务院周恩来总理阁下，中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长阁下，女士们，先生们：
    我代表阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，深深地感谢阿拉伯联合共和国大使阁下，举行这个充满兄弟情感的友好酒会。阿拉伯联合共和国人民和以加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统为首的阿拉伯联合共和国政府是一直帮助为争取自由、独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的。我们的人民是相信自己的权利，同样相信自己将取得战胜帝国主义力量的最后胜利。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，为它所得到的来自中国人民和他们政府的同情，感到非常高兴。这就一方面使得阿拉伯各国人民和中国人民之间的团结得到巩固，另一方面也使得阿拉伯各国人民和社会主义各国人民之间的团结得到巩固。阿拉伯人没有忘记这种团结和所有爱好和平的各国人民的支持曾制止了1956年英、法对埃及的侵略，同时也粉碎了美、英对伊拉克革命的进攻。这种形势是世界和平的胜利。毫无疑问，亚非各国人民的胜利已经临近了。
    亚非团结万岁！
    伟大的中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    为今天所有到会的外交界人士的健康干杯！陈毅副总理的讲话尊敬的拉加卜大使阁下，尊敬的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府
  代表团各位贵宾，同志们，女士们，先生们：
    今天，我能在拉加卜大使阁下举行的酒会上同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的各位贵宾又一次欢聚在一起，感到非常愉快。
    阿尔及利亚人民反对法帝国主义的斗争是阿拉伯人民和非洲人民反帝斗争的一个组成部分。阿拉伯联合共和国人民、伊拉克人民和阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，显示了阿拉伯人民和非洲人民坚强不屈的英雄气概，并且对这一地区的反帝斗争起了重大的推动作用。前几天在阿克拉胜利闭幕的全非人民大会，标志着非洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展。我们高兴地看到，阿拉伯人民和亚非人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中紧密地团结在一起。阿拉伯人民和亚非人民，特别是阿拉伯联合共和国政府和人民给予阿尔及利亚人民以强有力的支持，这对于阿尔及利亚人民坚持反对法帝国主义的武装斗争有极大的鼓舞作用。
    阿尔及利亚人民的斗争又是全世界人民争取和平、反对战争的斗争的一个组成部分，因此，不仅得到阿拉伯人民和亚非人民的支持，同时还得到社会主义各国以及爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。最近联合国大会关于阿尔及利亚问题的表决充分证明了这一点。这次表决的结果，只有十八个国家投反对票。这说明阿尔及利亚的国际威望正在日益增长，同时也再一次证实了东风压倒西风的形势。阿尔及利亚、阿拉伯联合共和国和所有亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲正在争取和维护民族独立的国家和地区和以苏联为首的社会主义各国都是刮起东风的地方。在今天东风压倒西风的时代，我们相信，阿尔及利亚人民一定会得到愈来愈多的国家和人民的支持，一定能够击败为美帝国主义所支持的法国侵略者。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团即将胜利地结束在中国的访问。刚才签字的联合公报表明我们两国在一些有关共同利益的问题上，取得了一致的看法。我们相信，你们的访问必将大大促进我们两国的友好关系和在共同斗争中的相互支持。
    我提议：
    为阿尔及利亚人民的胜利，
    为中阿两国人民的友谊，
    为中国人民和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊，
    为亚非人民大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔阁下的健康，
    为阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯阁下的健康，
    为阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团贵宾们的健康，
    为今天招待会的主人拉加卜大使阁下和他的夫人的健康，
    干杯！（附图片）
    我国和阿尔及利亚联合公报签字后，陈毅外长、周恩来总理、赫达部长、谢里夫部长（自右至左）举杯互贺。  新华社记者  邹健东摄
