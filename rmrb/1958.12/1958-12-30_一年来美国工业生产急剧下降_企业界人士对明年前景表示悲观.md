    US Industrial Production Declines Sharply Over the Past Year
    Business Community Pessimistic About Next Year's Prospects
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) According to preliminary materials published in American newspapers, under the attack of the economic crisis, US industrial production in 1958 fell by 7% compared with 1957. The production of major industrial sectors such as metallurgy, automobiles, coal mining, and petroleum all fell sharply during the year.
    From January to July this year, the operating rate of metallurgical industrial enterprises only accounted for 53% of their production capacity, and in April this year, it fell to 48%. Compared with 1957, US steel production fell by 25%.
    The automobile industry's production plummeted. Automobile production in 1958 fell by 30% compared with last year.
    The production of the coal mining industry is also constantly shrinking. Bituminous coal and anthracite coal were reduced by 20% in 1958.
    The extraction of oil decreased by 7.5%.
    The production of many other industrial sectors is also declining. Aluminum production fell by 9% in 1958, cotton cloth production fell by 6%, and durable industrial goods fell by 17.8%. The operating rate of the machine tool manufacturing industry is also very low. In the eleven months of 1958, orders for machine tools fell by 50%.
    Due to the decline in industrial production, the volume of freight transport in the railway sector decreased by 15.4% in 1958.
    The total value of US exports in 1958 decreased by 17% compared with 1957.
  From the materials cited in American newspapers, it can be clearly seen that in the past ten years, US industrial production has actually been stagnating. The following industrial production index can prove this point: (The industrial production value in 1947 is set at 100) 1953 was 134, 1954 was 124, 1955 was 139, 1956 was 143, 1957 was 143, and 1958 was 134.
    In view of the economic development situation in 1958, the American business community is also very pessimistic about the improvement of major industrial sectors next year. They believe that steel production will fall by 10% compared with 1957, and 20% of metallurgical industrial enterprises will not be able to operate. Automobile production in 1959 will fall by 20% compared with the level in 1957.

    一年来美国工业生产急剧下降
    企业界人士对明年前景表示悲观
    本报讯  根据美国报纸公布的初步材料，在经济危机的袭击下，1958年美国的工业生产比1957年下降了7％。冶金、汽车、采煤和石油等主要工业部门的生产在一年中都急剧下降。
    从今年1月开始到7月为止，冶金工业企业开工率仅占其生产能力的53％，今年的4月份曾下降到48％。与1957年相比，美国的钢产量下降了25％。
    汽车工业的生产惨跌。1958年汽车产量比去年下降了30％。
    采煤工业的生产也在不断缩减。烟煤和无烟煤在1958年缩减了20％。
    石油的开采量下降7.5％。
    其他许多工业部门的生产也在下降。1958年铝的生产下降9％，棉布的产量下降6％，耐用工业品下降17.8％。机床制造工业的开工率也很低。1958年十一个月里机床的订货额下降了50％。
    由于工业生产的下降，铁路部门的货运量在1958年减少了15.4％。
    1958年美国的出口总额比1957年缩减17％。
  从美国报纸引用的材料中，可以清楚地看出，在最近十年中美国的工业生产实际上是处于原地踏步的状态。下面的工业生产指数就可以证明这一点：（1947年的工业生产额定为一○○）1953年为一三四，1954年为一二四，1955年为一三九，1956年为一四三，1957年为一四三，1958年为一三四。
    鉴于1958年经济发展的情况，美国企业界对于来年的主要工业部门情况的改善也是很悲观的。他们认为，钢产量将会比1957年下降10％，冶金工业企业将有20％不能开工。1959年的汽车产量比1957年的水平将会下降20％。
