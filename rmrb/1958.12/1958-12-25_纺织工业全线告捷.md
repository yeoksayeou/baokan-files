Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Under the new situation of the great leap forward in the steel industry, China's textile industry in 1958 achieved "both giving way and leaping forward," and production achieved unprecedented development. This year's cotton yarn production plan was victoriously completed a month and a half ahead of schedule on November 15. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the national production of cotton yarn will reach 6.8 million pieces, an increase of about 46% compared with 1957; cotton cloth will reach 6.4078 billion meters, an increase of 27% compared with last year; wool fabrics will reach 23.59 million meters, an increase of 30%; other products such as linen fabrics and silk fabrics have also increased significantly compared with last year. Basic construction and machinery manufacturing have also seen great development. The growth rate of all these products not only greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate of the first five-year plan, but also exceeded 1956, the fastest-growing year in the first five-year plan. For example, the growth rate of cotton yarn in 1956 was 32%, while this year it is 46%. Due to the large increase in cotton cloth production this year, in 1959, urban and rural people in China will receive more cotton cloth than this year.

The textile industry has achieved astonishing achievements this year. On the one hand, the great leap forward of the entire national economy, "taking steel as the key link," especially the unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton, requires the textile industry to develop at a high speed; on the other hand, more than one million textile workers across the country, while supporting the steel "marshal" to take command and giving way to the "marshal," have demonstrated the communist style of daring to think and act and the revolutionary spirit of hard work and ingenuity, racking their brains to come up with many ways to overcome difficulties and achieve "both giving way and leaping forward." In the mass steelmaking movement, almost all textile factories and textile machinery factories across the country built indigenous blast furnaces and converters, fighting for steel on the one hand and ensuring textile production on the other. In Liaoning Province, the power supply was insufficient, and in September of this year, only 30% of the electricity was supplied to each textile factory. In order to ensure that the steel "marshal" received an adequate power supply, the textile factories solved the electricity problem on their own. During the days of fighting for steel, the machine repair workshops of many textile factories undertook the heavy task of manufacturing smelting equipment or power generation equipment, which affected the normal maintenance of textile machinery. At this time, many enterprises used methods such as shock repairs to overcome this difficulty. Many female weaving workers also actively learned the technology of repairing machines. Currently, many female workers have become versatile workers who can both weave and repair. When steel material transportation was tight, some textile factories experienced difficulties in the supply of raw cotton. Some textile factories in cotton-producing areas sent people to the countryside to rush to transport raw cotton to ensure the needs of production.

Through the implementation of the "four highs" and "four savings" policy and the development of a mass technical revolution movement, textile enterprises across the country have vigorously tapped the potential of existing enterprises, making the output, quality, and variety of textiles all take a leap forward. In carrying out the high speed, high yield, and high quality movement, factories have generally liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and greatly improved the production capacity of existing equipment. For example, taking the national average daily yarn production in November last year as 100%, the national average in November this year was 175%. Due to the development of the technical revolution, many key technical problems have been solved, and product quality has been significantly improved. For example, printing and dyeing shrinkage was a problem that had not been solved for a long time in the past. This year, workers successfully trial-produced simple anti-shrinkage machines and high-temperature baking machines, which can reduce the shrinkage rate of cotton cloth from 5% to 1%. There have also been many major innovations and creations in wool, linen, silk, printing, and dyeing. These fruitful technical revolution achievements will promote China's textile industry to move forward on a newer technological foundation in 1959.

    纺织工业全线告捷
    今年生产棉布六十四亿零七百八十万公尺  比去年增长27％
    据新华社24日讯  在钢铁工业突飞猛进的新形势下，1958年我国纺织工业做到了“既让路、又跃进”，生产获得了史无前例的大发展。今年的棉纱生产计划已经提前一个半月在11月15日胜利完成。预计到今年年底，全国生产的棉纱将达到六百八十万件，比1957年增加46％左右；棉布六十四亿零七百八十万公尺，比去年增加27％；毛织品二千三百五十九万公尺，增长30％，其他如麻织品、丝织品都比去年有很大的增长。基本建设和机械制造也都有很大的发展。所有这些产品的增长速度不仅大大超过了第一个五年计划平均每年增长的速度，而且超过了第一个五年计划中增长速度最快的1956年。如1956年棉纱的增长速度是32％，今年则是46％。由于今年棉布的大量增产，1959年，我国城乡人民得到的棉布将比今年有所增加。
    今年纺织工业获得了惊人的成就，一方面是由于“以钢为纲”的整个国民经济大跃进、特别是棉花的空前丰收要求纺织工业高速度地发展；另一方面是全国一百多万纺织职工在支持钢铁“元帅”升帐，又为“元帅”让路的情况下，发挥了敢想敢做的共产主义风格和苦干、巧干的革命精神，千方百计地想出了许多办法，克服困难，做到了“既让路，又跃进”。在全民炼钢的运动中，几乎全国所有的纺织厂和纺织机械厂都筑起了土高炉、土转炉，一面为钢而战，一面保证了纺织生产。辽宁省电力供应不足，今年9月只供给各纺织厂30％的电力。为了保证钢铁“元帅”得到充足的电力供应，各纺织厂就自力更生地解决电力问题。在为钢而战的日子里，许多纺织厂的机修车间担负了繁重的冶炼设备或发电设备的制造任务，使纺织机械的正常维修受到影响，这时，许多企业就用突击检修等办法来克服这一困难。许多挡车女工也积极学习检修机器的技术，目前已有不少女工成了既会挡车又会修理的多面手。当钢铁物资运输紧张的时候，部分纺织厂原棉供应发生困难，有些产棉区的纺织厂就自己派人下乡赶运原棉，保证生产的需要。
    全国纺织企业，通过贯彻“四高”“四省”的方针和开展群众性的技术革命运动，大力挖掘现有企业的潜力，使各项纺织品的产量、质量、花色品种都跃进了一大步。在开展高速度、高产量、高质量运动中，各厂普遍解放了思想，破除了迷信，大大地提高了现有设备的生产能力。如以去年11月份全国平均每日产纱量为100％，今年全国11月份平均为175％。由于技术革命的开展，许多技术关键问题得到解决，产品质量有了显著提高。如印染缩水是过去长期没有得到解决的问题，今年职工们试制成功了简易防缩机和高温烘焙机，使棉布的缩水率可以由5％下降到1％。在毛、麻、丝、印染等方面也有许多重大的革新创造。这些丰硕的技术革命成果，将促使1959年我国纺织工业在更新的技术基础上向前迈进。
