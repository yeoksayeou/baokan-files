The railway department seized the opportunity of lower coal transport volume at the beginning of the month to rush transport a large quantity of daily necessities to supply the needs of urban and rural areas.

Recently, due to heavy steel transport tasks, many places have a backlog of daily necessities awaiting shipment. The Ministry of Railways, based on the situation that coal mines carry out mechanical repairs at the beginning of the month, resulting in less coal transport volume, decided to use this gap to squeeze out railway cars to rush transport urgently needed market goods.

On November 29, the Ministry of Railways issued an order requiring each railway administration to contact local Party committees and relevant freight units to organize this transport. As of 18:00 on December 2, all administrations across the country had rushed to transport 6,135 tons of grain, general merchandise, vegetables, edible salt, meat, cotton, and other goods.

This newspaper reports that commercial departments in various parts of Anhui Province have generally implemented the method of manual herding in short-distance live pig transport in order to speed up the transfer. After adopting this method, the amount of live pigs transferred from Fuyang Prefecture alone increased by 100,000 head in October, more than double the amount transferred out in September, thus strongly supporting the processing of exports by freezing plants and the supply of pork to cities.

The method of artificial herding of live pigs adopted by various places is mainly to set up temporary feeding stations along the way, generally one every twenty-five to thirty *li*, specifically responsible for the accommodation and feeding of personnel herding live pigs. In the transport, artificial herding is the main method, and vehicles and ships returning empty are immediately loaded. In order to strengthen the work of live pig transfer, many areas have also set up special offices. Fuyang Prefecture has set up two concentration points within the prefecture according to the flow of live pigs. In addition to fully preparing the necessary tools, medicines, and a small amount of feed for the journey, a comprehensive health check is carried out on the live pigs about to be herded. Responsibility is also clearly defined and responsibilities are divided during transport. Many areas have not only avoided weight loss but also created experience in increasing weight during artificial herding. In late October, Sixian herded 817 live pigs to Guzhen, 140 *li* away, a journey of six days. Each pig gained an average of more than one *jin*.

    本报讯  铁路部门抓紧月初煤炭运输量较小的机会，突击运输了大批生活日用必需品，供应城乡的需要。
    最近，由于钢铁运输任务繁重，不少地方积压了一批待运的生活日用必需品。铁道部根据各煤矿月初检修机械，煤炭运输量较少的情况，决定利用这个间隙挤出车皮抢运市场急需的物资。
    11月29日，铁道部发出命令，要求各铁路管理局同当地党委和有关货运单位联系，组织这一运输。截至2日十八时止，全国各管理局已抢运粮食、日用百货、蔬菜、食盐、肉、棉花等六千一百三十五吨。
    本报讯  安徽省各地商业部门为了加快调运速度，在短途生猪调运中普遍实行了人工赶运的办法。采用这个办法后仅阜阳专区10月份生猪调运量即增加了十万头，比9月份外调量增加一倍多，从而有力地支持了冷冻厂加工出口和城市猪肉的供应。
    各地所采取的人工赶运生猪的办法主要是沿途设立临时饲养站，一般每隔二十五到三十华里一个，专门负责赶运生猪人员的住宿和喂养生猪。赶运中以人工赶运为主，遇有回空车船就马上装运。为了加强生猪调运工作，许多地区还专门成立办公机构，阜阳专区根据生猪流向，在专区内设立两个集中点。在赶运中除了充分准备好途中必需的工具、药械及少部分饲料外，并对即将赶运的生猪全面进行健康检查。在赶运时也做到明确责任，分工负责。许多地区在人工赶运中已经做到了不仅不掉膘还创造了增膘的经验。泗县在10月下旬一次赶运八百一十七头生猪到相距一百四十华里的固镇去，途中赶运六天。每头平均增重一斤多。
