Applying top dressing to winter wheat is an extremely important measure in current field management. However, on the basis of relatively high soil fertility (such as in satellite high-yield fields), what kind of fertilizer should be applied? How much should be applied? How should it be applied? When will it take effect? And will it cause excessive growth? Currently, there is a lack of sufficient data. Therefore, we conducted a small top-dressing experiment to find some basis for top-dressing in these types of fields. From this small top-dressing experiment, it can be seen that using well-decomposed human waste and urine for top-dressing can rapidly promote wheat seedling tillering and make them grow strong. Therefore, we are introducing these results below for reference in various regions.

The previous cultivation management of this experiment was as follows: plowing one foot deep; applying 300,000 jin of high-quality compost per mu; using the 6028 wheat variety, evenly sowing 1.3 million seeds per mu; sowing on October 14th, with very uniform emergence.

We applied top dressing on November 6th, which was the three-leaf stage, with only individual plants beginning to tiller. The fertilizer applied was a mixture of half well-decomposed human waste and urine and half a 3% superphosphate aqueous solution. The application rates were 3,000 jin, 6,000 jin, and 12,000 jin per mu, plus a no-fertilizer control, for a total of four treatments. After top-dressing, we conducted fixed-plant investigations, and by the fifth day, the effects of top-dressing were clearly visible. We also conducted investigations on the number of tillers, the number of leaves per plant, the width of the leaves, and the height of the plants in each treatment, with seventy-five plants in each. Preliminary results showed that the more fertilizer applied, the more the number of tillers increased. In terms of the average number of tillers per plant, the treatment with 3,000 jin of top-dressing per mu increased nearly onefold compared to the unfertilized control; the treatment with 6,000 jin of top-dressing per mu increased more than twofold compared to the unfertilized control; and the treatment with 12,000 jin of top-dressing per mu was particularly outstanding, increasing more than sixfold compared to the unfertilized control. At the same time, it can also be seen that top-dressing can promote the growth of new leaves and increase the width of the leaves, making the wheat seedlings grow strong. This shows that timely top-dressing can make wheat seedlings grow strong before winter. The stronger the wheat seedlings grow before winter, the larger the wheat ears will be the following year.

Appropriate top-dressing at the current stage will not cause excessive growth of wheat seedlings: In wheat cultivation, there is generally a concern that excessive top-dressing before winter will cause excessive growth, but based on our top-dressing results, under conditions of low temperatures and with a mixture of fast-acting organic fertilizers (well-decomposed human waste and urine) and chemical fertilizers, with appropriate coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, excessive growth will not be caused. The plant height of the various treatments we conducted showed that there was no significant difference in plant height, whether it was top-dressing with 3,000 jin, 6,000 jin, or 12,000 jin.

Comprehensive analysis of the above three aspects of investigation data shows that applying well-decomposed human waste and urine and other mixed fertilizers can rapidly increase the tillering of wheat before winter, make the wheat seedlings grow strong, and does not cause excessive growth. Therefore, we believe that seizing the opportunity to use well-decomposed human waste and urine and other fast-acting phosphorus and potassium fertilizers (such as superphosphate, wood ash, etc.) for top-dressing wheat is very beneficial.

    人粪尿追施小麦好处多
    中国科学院西北生物土壤研究所
    冬小麦追肥，是当前田间管理上一项极其重要的措施。但是在土壤肥力比较高的基础上（如卫星丰产田），究竟应当追些甚么肥料？追多少？如何追法？追下去又几时能够发生作用？会不会引起徒长？目前还缺乏足够的资料。因此，我们作了一个小型的追肥试验，以便为这类田的追肥找些依据。从这个小型的追肥试验里看出，利用腐熟的人粪尿等追肥可以迅速的促进麦苗分蘖，使其生长健壮。所以，将此结果介绍如下，供各地参考。
    这项试验的前一时期栽培管理情况是：翻地一尺深；每亩施质量较好的堆肥三十万斤；品种采用6028小麦，每亩均匀播种一百三十万粒种子；于10月14日播种，出苗非常整齐。
    我们于11月6日进行了追肥，这时正是三叶期，仅个别植株开始分蘖。追施的肥料是一半腐熟的人粪尿液混合上一半3％的过磷酸钙水溶液。施用量是每亩折合三千斤、六千斤、一万二千斤，加上不追肥对照，共四个处理。追肥后我们进行了固定植株的调查，至第五天则明显的看出了追肥的效果。我们又在每个处理中分别进行了七十五个植株的分蘖数、全株叶数、叶片宽度和植株高度的调查，初步可以看出，追肥量愈多，分蘖数增加的也就愈多。就平均每株分蘖数来看，每次追肥三千斤的，比未追肥的增加将近一倍；每亩追肥六千斤的，比未追肥的增加二倍多；追肥一万二千斤的尤其突出，比未追肥的增加六倍多。同时还可以看出，追肥可增进新叶的生长和增加叶片的宽度，使麦苗生长健壮。这说明及时追肥可使麦苗在冬前生长健壮。麦苗在冬前生长愈健壮，次年的麦穗也就愈大。
    在现阶段适量追肥，并不会引起麦苗徒长：在小麦栽培上，一般常顾虑冬前较多的追肥会引起徒长，但就我们的追肥结果来看，在气温较低，而且以速效有机肥料（腐熟人粪尿）与化学肥料混合追施，氮磷钾适当配合的条件下，是不会引起徒长的。我们进行的各种处理的植株高度表明，无论是追肥三千斤、六千斤或者一万二千斤，在植株高度上没有明显的差异。
    综合以上三方面的调查资料可以看出，追施腐熟人粪尿等混合肥料可以迅速的增加小麦冬前的分蘖，使麦苗生长健壮，而并未引起徒长现象。因此，我们认为抓紧时机，利用腐熟人粪尿和其他速效磷、钾肥料（如过磷酸钙、草木灰等），小麦进行一次追肥是大有好处的。
