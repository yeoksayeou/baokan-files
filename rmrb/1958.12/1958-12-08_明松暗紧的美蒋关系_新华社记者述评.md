    The U.S.-Chiang Relationship: Apparent Relaxation, Underlying Tension
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Commentary
    It has been over a month since the Taipei Chiang-Dulles talks. The storm the results of these talks stirred up in Taiwan seems to have subsided slightly on the surface recently. However, with apparent relaxation but underlying tension, the United States is implementing its established policy step by step, and the contradictions between it and the Taiwan authorities are actually becoming increasingly profound.
    “Misunderstandings” Deepen with Explanation
    The Taipei talks' communiqué put the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" on the table, clearly stipulating that the Chiang Kai-shek group "will not use force" and can only represent the small "Free China" from now on. Pro-Chiang newspapers described this communiqué as if "millions of atomic bombs were dropped," causing widespread anger, frustration, and fear among Taiwan's military and government personnel. Key members of the Taiwan authorities were busy coming out to frequently "explain," claiming that they had not agreed to "not use force." However, the Americans showed no mercy. On November 26th, the Chiang Kai-shek group's "ambassador" to the United States, Yeh Kung-chao, had just made another speech in San Francisco on this issue, trying his best to clarify the "misunderstanding" of the Taipei talks' communiqué. But on December 4th, Dulles, in a speech in San Francisco, once again emphasized that the Chiang Kai-shek group's agreement in the communiqué to "not use force" was of "great significance." Dulles once again announced in a completely manipulative tone that "the government of the Republic of China currently located in Taipei" can only serve as "a qualified guardian of that culture" of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial China he admired, and must not take "any reckless action."
    “Tightrope” Drawn Tighter
    Taiwan newspapers call the U.S. policy towards the Chiang Kai-shek group a "tightrope policy." Obviously, this tightrope will be drawn tighter and tighter. The first step is to isolate Taiwan, and the second step is to "trusteeship" Taiwan. Over the past month, the entire set of vicious schemes of the United States has become clearer. Although U.S. officials are still evasive about the "trusteeship" point, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, who actively serves as Dulles's helper, has openly spread the rhetoric of erasing China's sovereignty over Taiwan. There is no shortage of American and British political figures who bluntly reveal Dulles's intentions. At the end of last month, on an American television program, former British Prime Minister Attlee and former U.S. President Truman echoed each other, advocating to "internationalize" Taiwan. The Taiwan side has reacted strongly to this point. Chiang Kai-shek, Huang Shao-ku, and others have successively made speeches last month, opposing this absurd proposition of "internationalization" and "trusteeship."
    “Allies” with No Integrity
    While the Taiwan authorities are worried, they are still expressing their intention to "closely cooperate with the American allies" through "resolutely opposing communism." Of course, U.S. imperialism is indeed resolutely anti-communist; it wants to permanently occupy Taiwan as a base for aggression against China. However, the fierce imperialists only want the base; they do not talk about "allied integrity" at all. U.S. Vice President Nixon publicly said in London at the end of November that "Taiwan is a piece of real estate that the United States wants to hold in its hands." Nixon also said not long ago that this U.S. policy is not to "link the United States with Chiang Kai-shek." In the eyes of U.S. authorities, it is precisely by making the current Taiwan authorities have no place to stand that they can carry out "trusteeship" and permanently turn Taiwan into the "real estate" of the United States, a U.S. colony and a war base. If anyone still doubts this, then please take a look at a booklet recently published with money from U.S. institutions in Hong Kong, the title of which has the big characters "To Oppose Communism, You Must First Overthrow Chiang."
    Taiwanese Feel Chilled
    After the move that Dulles revealed in Taipei, the Kuomintang people in Taiwan can no longer close their eyes and ignore the truth. The pro-Chiang newspaper "Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily" said on October 27th that the United States wants to "neutralize Taiwan and turn it into a U.S. base in the Western Pacific, using officials and soldiers of the Republic of China as mercenaries hired by the United States," and the United States wants to place these officials and soldiers in a "prison and act as prison guards."
    The invading troops that the United States increased to Taiwan during the tense situation in August and September are still stationed there and have not moved. In addition to the naval and air forces, about four thousand U.S. Marines who were sent to southern Taiwan in early September under the pretext of participating in exercises are also continuing to be stationed there. The U.S. "ambassador" to Taiwan also told these U.S. ground forces in November: "Keep your swords sharp – you may have to use them one day." It would be ridiculous to rely on these few troops for an "amphibious landing" on the mainland. It is not difficult for discerning people to see on whose heads the prison guard's sword is hanging. Recently, there have been many discussions among Taiwanese people about "sitting idly by and watching the prairie fire, with death imminent" and "taking a step back, there is no place to die." It seems that they cannot help but be moved by this dangerous prospect.

    明松暗紧的美蒋关系
    新华社记者述评
    台北蒋杜会谈以来，一个多月了。这次会谈结果在台湾激起的惊涛骇浪，近日里浮面上似略显平缓。但是，明松暗紧，美国在步步推行其既定政策，它同台湾当局间的矛盾实际上正愈益深刻。
    “误解”越辩越深
    台北会谈公报，把美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋摆上桌面，明白规定蒋介石集团“不使用武力”，从此只能代表小小的“自由中国”。亲蒋报纸形容，这项公报犹如“投下千万颗原子弹”，使台湾军政人员一片愤懑、沮丧、忧惧。台湾当局要员们忙着出来频频“解释”，声称并未答应“不使用武力”。奈何美国人毫不留情。11月26日，蒋介石集团驻美国“大使”叶公超，刚在旧金山再次就这个问题发表谈话，竭力要澄清对台北会谈公报的“误解”，而12月4日，杜勒斯在旧金山发表的演说又再一次强调蒋介石集团在公报里同意“不使用武力”“有重大意义”。杜勒斯又一次以十足摆布者的口吻宣布，“目前设在台北的中华民国政府”，只能作为他所欣赏的中国半封建半殖民地的“那种文化的有资格的保护人”，不得采取“任何鲁莽行动”。
    “钢索”越抽越紧
    台湾报纸把美国对蒋介石集团的这种政策，称之为“钢索政策”。显然，这条钢索还将愈抽愈紧，第一步是孤立台湾，第二步要“托管”台湾。一个多月来，美国这整套毒辣计谋，已经更加明朗了。美国官方虽还对“托管”这点讳莫如深，但是积极充当杜勒斯帮手的英国外交大臣劳埃德却已公然在散布抹杀中国对台湾的主权的论调了。美英政界人士赤裸裸地道破杜勒斯心计的不乏其人。上个月底，在美国的电视节目里，英国前首相艾德礼和美国前总统杜鲁门，就一唱一和，鼓吹要把台湾“国际化”。台湾方面对这点已产生强烈反应。蒋介石、黄少谷等人上月来接连发表谈话，反对这种“国际化”、“托管”的荒谬主张。
    “盟友”毫无信义
    台湾当局人士一面忧心忡忡，一面却仍在表示要以“坚决反共”来“同美国盟友密切合作”。当然，美帝国主义确是坚决反共的，它想要永远霸占台湾，作为侵略中国的基地。但是，凶恶的帝国主义者，所要者基地也，什么“盟友信义”是根本不讲的。美国副总统尼克松11月底在伦敦公开说，“台湾是美国要抓在手里的一块不动产”。尼克松在不久以前还说过，美国这种政策并不是要让美国“同蒋介石连结起来”。在美国当权人士看来，正是要使得目前的台湾当局存身无地，才能搞“托管”，才能永远变台湾为美国的“不动产”、美国的殖民地和战争基地。如果还有人对此怀疑，那么请看看在香港的美国机构最近出钱刊印的一本小册子，书名便有几个大字，“反共必先倒蒋”。
    台湾人士寒心
    经过杜勒斯在台北露出的这一手，台湾国民党人士也是不能再闭眼不看真情了。香港亲蒋报纸“工商日报”在10月27日说，美国是要“把台湾中立化起来，成为美国在西太平洋的基地，而以中华民国的官员士兵作为美国雇佣的戍卒”，美国是要把这些官员士兵安置在一个“监狱里而自为监狱官”。
    美国在8、9月间制造紧张局势中，增调到台湾的侵略军队，至今仍然赖在那里不动。除海空军外，在9月初以参加演习为名开到台湾南部的约四千名美国海军陆战队，也继续驻扎在那里。美国驻台湾“大使”11月间还叮嘱这些美国地面部队：“使你们的宝剑保持锐利——你们可能会有一天不得不使用它们”。要靠这点点部队用来向大陆“两栖登陆”，自属贻笑之谈。监狱官之剑，悬于何人头上，明眼人不难洞悉。近来台湾人士中颇多“坐视燎原，死亡无日”、“后退一步，即无死所”之类的议论，看来，对这种危险的前景已不能不有所动于衷了。
