　　Seize Agricultural Product Procurement, Ensure Good Supply of Non-staple Foods
　　Enable the People to Have a Happy New Year
　　Central Finance and Trade Department Demands Another One or Several Rush Campaigns
　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th - Comrade Li Xiannian, at the telephone conference of finance and trade secretaries of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions convened by the Central Finance and Trade Department of the CPC on the 17th, demanded that regions (provinces, districts, or special districts and counties) that have not yet completed their agricultural product procurement tasks seize the opportunity to launch another one or several rush procurement campaigns in order to strive for the victorious completion of the annual procurement task; regions that have already completed their main agricultural product procurement tasks should continue to verify figures, settle accounts, and pay attention to storage, while also doing a good job in the procurement of small local and special products. While focusing on procurement work, efforts should also be made to ensure the supply of grain and non-staple foods.
　　The meeting began with reports from Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Henan, Shandong and other provinces on the current state of agricultural product procurement and transfer work and the supply of non-staple foods. Comrade Li Xiannian delivered a speech at the end. He said that in the previous stage, under the high tide of steel production and the busy tasks of autumn harvesting and planting, the procurement volume of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, tobacco, and live pigs greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year, and the achievements are very great. The development of the movement is also healthy. This is the result of the efforts of all finance and trade cadres and the broad masses under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. In the early stage of the movement, phenomena such as rough quality and inaccurate figures occurred in individual regions. However, after the leading departments promptly put forward the principle of grasping both quantity and quality, and grasping both speed and quality, and universally launched large-scale inspections, clean-ups, and account settlements, the movement is currently developing in a more in-depth and solid direction.
　　Comrade Li Xiannian said that according to reports from various regions, although the procurement of various major agricultural products continued to progress in the first half of December, it appeared to be slower compared to the procurement progress in late November. The average daily procurement volume of agricultural products in this half-month decreased somewhat compared to late November. Part of this decline is reasonable. For example, some provinces and regions have completed or are close to completing their annual tasks, and the procurement volume cannot, of course, increase as dramatically as in the past; the vast majority of regions across the country are verifying and settling accounts, and some regions are completing warehousing procedures. Although the procurement progress in this stage appears slower, the procurement figures are more accurate, which is normal. However, recently some regions have emphasized verification work and have produced another tendency. Some grassroots cadres, in order to allow their teams and communes to retain and use a little more, conceal their yields and underreport them; some localities even mistakenly fail to assign the state's procurement tasks downward. These ideas have affected the procurement progress to some extent. Therefore, it is suggested that finance and trade departments in all regions must strengthen the communist education of cadres under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, establish an overall concept and a national concept, overcome departmentalism, and continue to strengthen agricultural product procurement. It must be pointed out that exaggeration is certainly wrong, but concealing yields is also not a realistic work style, and both must be criticized. In the future, grain procurement in all regions should be completed according to the state plan. After completing the state plan, if the people's communes continue to request to sell, the state should satisfy their sales requests, but attention should be paid to avoiding over-purchasing grain. In addition to the portion of economic crops that are retained by the people's communes as stipulated by the state, all portions that need to be controlled by the state should be purchased by the state.
　　Comrade Li Xiannian said that the current progress of agricultural product procurement is uneven in terms of region and variety. Therefore, different requirements should be put forward for different regions and different varieties in the future. If the procurement task in a certain region has not been completed, then that region should continue to launch a rush procurement campaign; if the procurement of a certain variety is not good, then the procurement campaign for that variety should be continued. Regions that have completed their main agricultural product procurement tasks should continue to do a good job in verification, settling accounts, and processing and transferring, and at the same time use a certain amount of effort to do a good job in the procurement of small local and special products. In short, the entire agricultural product procurement movement should be both vigorous and down-to-earth; both complete the tasks and comply with the policies; both grasp the big and grasp the small; both grasp the domesticated and grasp the wild; both grasp the procurement and grasp the processing and transfer, so that each link is connected to the next, and the agricultural product procurement task can be comprehensively completed.
　　Comrade Li Xiannian said that this year is a year of great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, and it is also the first year of realizing the people's communes. Now that the New Year and the Spring Festival are approaching, in order to enable the people of the whole country to have a happy and lively New Year, finance and trade departments in all regions should earnestly do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods under the unified leadership of the local Party committees. In addition to arranging the supply of non-staple foods in their own regions, all regions must also vigorously support Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Liaoning in their needs for non-staple foods, and ensure the completion of the allocation plan.

### 抓紧农产品收购  做好副食品供应  使人民热热闹闹过个好年  中央财贸部要求再开展一次或几次突击运动

    抓紧农产品收购  做好副食品供应
    使人民热热闹闹过个好年
    中央财贸部要求再开展一次或几次突击运动
    新华社19日讯  李先念同志在17日中共中央财贸部召开的各省、市、自治区财贸书记电话会议上，要求尚未完成农产品采购任务的地区（省、区或专、县），抓紧时机，再开展一次或几次突击收购运动，为胜利地完成全年收购任务而努力；已经完成主要农产品采购任务的地区要继续核实数字，结清账目，注意保管，同时做好小宗土特产品的收购工作。在抓收购工作的同时，要做好粮食和副食品的供应工作。
    会议首先由黑龙江、四川、河南、山东等省汇报了目前农产品收购调运工作和副食品供应的情况。李先念同志最后讲了话。他说，前一阶段在钢铁生产高潮、秋收秋种任务繁忙的情况下，粮、棉、烟、生猪等主要农产品的收购量都大大超过了去年同期水平，成绩是十分巨大的，运动的发展也是健康的。这是在各级党委领导下，全体财贸干部和广大群众努力的结果。运动初期在个别地区曾经发生过质量粗糙、数字不够准确等现象，但是在领导部门及时提出既要抓数量又要抓质量，既要抓快又要抓好的方针，并且普遍展开了大检查、大清理、大结账以后，目前运动正朝着更深入扎实的方向发展。
    李先念同志说，根据各地汇报，12月上半月各项主要农产品的收购工作虽然续有进展，但同11月下旬的收购进度比较显得缓慢。这半个月每天平均收购农产品的数量比11月下旬有些下降。这种下降的情况有一部分是合理的。例如有些省、区已经完成或接近完成全年任务，收购数量当然不可能像过去一样地大量增长；全国绝大多数地区正在核实结账，有的地区正在补办入库手续，这样虽然显得这一阶段的收购进度慢了一些，但是收购的数字更确实了，这种情况是正常的。但是最近也有一些地区强调核实工作以后，又产生了另一种倾向，有些基层干部为了使自己所在的队、社多留一点、多用一点，就隐瞒产量，以多报少；有的地方甚至错误地不把国家下达的收购任务向下布置，这些思想都在一定程度上影响了收购进度。因此，建议各地财贸部门必须在各级党委的领导下，加强干部的共产主义教育，树立整体观念和国家观念，克服本位主义思想，继续加强农产品采购工作，必须指出：浮夸固然不对，隐瞒产量也不是实事求是的作风，两者都必须加以批判。今后，各地对粮食的收购要按照国家的计划完成，在完成国家计划以后如果人民公社继续要求出售，国家应该满足其出售要求，但应注意不要买过头粮。经济作物除了按照国家规定留给人民公社的部分外，凡是需要由国家掌握的部分都应该由国家收购起来。
    李先念同志说，目前农产品的收购进度在地区上、品种上还不平衡，因此今后应该分别不同地区，不同品种，提出不同要求，哪一个地区的收购任务没有完成，那一个地区就继续开展突击收购运动；哪一个品种收购得不好，就继续开展那个品种的收购运动。已经完成主要农产品收购任务的地区就要继续做好核实工作，结清账目，搞好加工调运，同时要用一定力量来做好小土特产的收购工作。总之，在整个农产品收购运动中既要轰轰烈烈，又要踏踏实实；既要完成任务，又要符合政策；既要抓大的，又要抓小的；既要抓家生的，又要抓野生的；既要抓收购，又要抓加工调运，这样才能一环套一环，全面地完成农产品收购任务。
    李先念同志说，今年全国粮食生产大丰收，农民多吃一点是应该的。但是，农村的畜牧业还需要大力发展，要准备一定数量的饲料；同时目前我国农村的粮食储备量也不够充裕，丰收以后，一定要有计划地增加储备粮。因此，要教育各地干部在粮食的掌握上一定要通盘考虑，有计划的使用，既要保证口粮，又要留足种籽、饲料和储备粮；既要保证吃饱，又要防止浪费。至于城市居民的口粮，仍应继续贯彻执行计划供应的政策，保证正常的粮食供应。
    李先念同志最后说，今年是我国工农业生产大跃进的一年，又是实现人民公社化的第一年。现在新年和春节即将来临，为了使全国人民高高兴兴、热热闹闹地过个好年，各地财贸部门应该在当地党委的统一领导下切实地做好副食品的供应工作。各地除了安排好本地区的副食品供应工作外，还必须大力支持北京、天津、上海和辽宁等地对副食品的需要，保证调拨计划的完成。
