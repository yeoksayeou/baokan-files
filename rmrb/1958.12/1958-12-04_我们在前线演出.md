    We Perform on the Front Lines
    Zhou Weizhi, Xue Enhou, Meng Xifei
    The Capital's Literary and Art Circles' Fujian Front慰问Performance Troupe worked for a month on the front lines, performing a total of 390 shows. Although the time spent on the front lines was not long, hearing and witnessing the many heroic struggles of the People's Liberation Army and the heroic people deeply educated the comrades. Some reflected, "I have read some articles expressing the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army in the past, but this time I saw it myself." Throughout the entire慰问stage, all members of the troupe were full of energy and high in political enthusiasm, completing 100% of the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people of the capital. Therefore, the comrades unanimously believe that the Fujian front is a communist school, and the People's Liberation Army will always be our role model.

    Striving to Perform More for Our Loved Ones
    We are honored to perform more, add more programs, and perform more on the front lines. Our slogan is: "Everything for our loved ones," and our determination is: "Without conditions, without fear of hardship, without fear of danger, wherever there are soldiers, we will perform there; wherever there is a place, a stage, we can perform, even in the dark; we can play music on cliffs, and dance and tumble on the battlefields."

    The leaders of the troops paid great attention to the safety of us literary and art workers, asking us to "obey the organization" and not to "act freely." Our slogan is to combine obedience to the organization with striving to achieve. On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, when we had just arrived in Xiamen, we seized the opportunity to go to the front lines. Several groups went to the positions that night, representing the people of the capital to greet the soldiers and perform programs for them, spending the festival with them amidst the intense artillery fire.

    "Performing on the most forward-positioned islands" can be regarded as the most exciting call. Many comrades from the Chinese Pingju Opera院, Beijing People's Art Theater, and the China Youth Art Theater completed the glorious task of 慰问on the islands with fortunate feelings.

    The islands are not large, some only one or two square kilometers. On the one hand, we carried out decentralized and small-scale慰问performances on the artillery positions, and on the other hand, we performed large-scale theatrical programs in the tunnels for the soldiers, commanders, and the island's militia and female self-defense队员. When the comrades from the Chinese Pingju Opera院went to Wuyu Island to perform, they heard that the soldiers loved to watch modern dramas and also wanted to see traditional repertoires, so they temporarily compressed the two major dramas "Bitter Vegetables" and "Bao Gong's Three Investigations" into a '晚会' program for them. The performance venue was a crossroads in a tunnel that was only two or three meters square up, down, left, and right. This brightly lit (gas lamp) and candlelit "front-line grand auditorium" could only accommodate more than two hundred people. Three passages were the auditorium, and the other passage was the backstage. The intersection could not accommodate tables, chairs, or benches, let alone entrances and exits. The actors bumped into each other when entering and exiting, and four characters had to perform shoulder to shoulder when they came on stage. For the sake of their loved ones, the actors did not care about the unevenness of the tunnels and still walked on tiptoes. In order to meet the theater-watching needs of the entire island's military and civilians, they performed three shows a day, morning, noon, and evening.

    When we arrived in Xiamen, the weather was changeable. It was hot enough to get prickly heat, and cold enough to put on a cotton coat. All this was nothing to the actors. Although the scorching sun burned the actors' earrings, the typhoon blocked the actors' singing, and the rain soaked the actors' costumes, the sun, typhoon, and rain could not stop us from performing for our loved ones. Once, when performing "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," it was performed in a non-ventilated area for concealment. At this time, the weather was extremely hot and humid, and the soldiers were still sweating even in shorts and vests; however, the actors on the stage were all wearing old sheepskin coats. On the contrary, once the weather suddenly turned cold, and the soldiers were wearing cotton coats to watch the show. When they saw the peacock dance being performed on stage, the actors were all wearing light gauze costumes, dancing gracefully in the spring atmosphere on the stage. The soldiers were very worried that the actors might get cold! But the actors did not feel cold. The soldiers said with emotion, "You are too good."

    The team from the Central Song and Dance Troupe, with only thirty people, ran the longest roads and had the most stops on the front lines. They also strived to perform two shows a day, and each performance often lasted three to four hours. Because there were few actors and the performance time was so long, the work was very intense, and they went wherever there were soldiers. For example, after the activities at a certain command post on the front lines ended, they heard that there were still two comrades on duty at the observation post who had not been able to see the performance. The comrades automatically organized a group, climbed up the high ground, and performed a half-hour program for the two comrades on duty at the observation post. The actors from the China Peking Opera院 automatically added programs after performing a show because they heard that the audience loved to watch the show. Sometimes it lasted five to six hours. Comrade Li Hezeng took the initiative to solicit opinions from the soldiers in the tunnel: "I will sing a section for everyone, what do you like to hear?" Some soldiers said "I like the Empty City Stratagem," others suggested "Killing the Fisherman," and some liked "Eliminating the Three Evils." Comrade Li Hezeng said, "Then I will sing all three!" The soldiers applauded him warmly.

    The actors were very good at seizing every opportunity to perform for their loved ones, such as singing another section to the soldiers who could not finish leaving the theater or square when they were seeing off the soldiers; sometimes when the soldiers got on the bus and the car did not start, the actors pushed the car for their loved ones. On the other hand, when the actors were being seen off to the bus by the soldiers, the actors also had to dance a round with the golden cudgel for their loved ones.

    Wherever there are soldiers, we go to sing. We sang for the cooks, for the sentry comrades, for the wounded, for the convalescents, and we joined in singing with the soldiers during the get-togethers.

    Get-Togethers, Chatting, and Writing Poetry
    Decentralized activities on the front lines have many advantages. They can blend in with the soldiers, have座谈s with them about battle stories, chat, have get-togethers, write poetry, leave messages, exchange gifts, and the forms are lively and the emotions are warm; they can fully convey the love and care of the people in the rear for the soldiers on the front lines, and report on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the country, which is a great encouragement to the soldiers. Through conversations, many heroic stories can be learned. The personal accounts of heroic figures have greatly educated the comrades of the performance troupe. After meeting the heroes, the comrades were more energetic and in higher spirits, often talking enthusiastically late into the night and not sleeping for a long time.

    In order to meet the various requirements of the soldiers, we also conducted many large and medium-sized performances. Because the soldiers love to watch plays, and heard that famous actors from the capital had come, they all wanted to meet them and watch a complete play. They have time to take turns off, and they can go to the theaters in the "rear" to watch big plays. Sometimes there is a house where two or three hundred people can watch plays conveniently, so medium-sized performances are held, lasting one or two hours. This is called a combination of large, medium, and small. The relationship between the actors and the audience is not as intimate as in decentralized activities during large-scale performances. After the performance, the actors immediately ran to the auditorium, ran to the theater entrance to send off the audience, beat gongs and drums, shouted slogans, shook hands with the soldiers, and saw them off to the bus. At that time, the emotions inside and outside the venue were warm, and another climax of mutual慰问was formed. Sometimes this moving scene would last for as long as fifty or sixty minutes. In the later stages, we also developed serving tea to the audience and counting 快板when sending off the audience. Everyone used these methods to strengthen the relationship with the soldiers and better complete the task of 慰问our loved ones.

    Decentralized performances on the front lines require diverse forms, so actors, band members, stage staff, and administrative leaders have all become all-rounders. If they don't sing or speak, they always have to contribute some programs, otherwise they feel ashamed of their loved ones. Therefore, not only drama actors have to sing, perform相声, and count 快板, but also song and dance actors have to sing operas, and even Peking and Pingju Operaactors have to sing songs and recite poems aloud. Comrade Feng Zicun not only plays "Happy Reunion," but also participated in the accompaniment work of Peking Opera and Pingju Opera.

    In order to better complete the performance tasks, better reflect the front-line struggles, and give full play to the propaganda, educational, and encouraging role of art, creation has become a common task for all comrades in the troupe. This time, the troupe created a total of 264 pieces of various sizes. The content of the creation is entirely based on praising heroic deeds, heroic figures, and heroic companies, and it is written about wherever we go, so the soldiers respond very strongly. For example, when singing about the deeds of a certain unit in that unit, the soldiers responded by saying, "You just came here, how can you be so clear about us, it's great."

    These creations have greatly strengthened the relationship between the troupe and the soldiers, who feel very 친근and fully reflect the care of the people in the rear for the front lines. For example, some soldiers said after watching a short play reflecting their lives, "The people in the capital know everything that happens to us on the front lines."

    Small Gifts Express Deep Affection
    Performing alone cannot fully express our hearts. The actors have prepared various small gifts, such as portraits of Chairman Mao, photos of Beijing scenery, commemorative badges, diaries, cigarettes, candies, chili sauce, and pomelos, to bring to the front-line positions and give to their loved ones.

    Some actors gave the International Youth Festival commemorative candies to a class. The soldiers named the candies "Eight Immortals Elixir," meaning that they would have strength after eating them. When some companies received the diaries and picture gifts given by the actors, the instructor said to the soldiers, "Whoever fights well will get them."

    The actors from the China Youth Art Theater poeticized the gifts they brought. For example, they inscribed poems on the pomelos they gave to the soldiers and encouraged each other through mutual chanting and encouragement. The actors wrote:

    Thousands and thousands of pomelo slices,
    Each slice represents the people's heart.
    Pomelo, pomelo,
    Heroes dine together,
    Recover Kinmen and Matsu,
    Liberate Taiwan.

    Some soldiers ate the pomelos and kept the skins, and some soldiers were reluctant to eat them, so they simply tied the pomelos to the cannons with ropes and answered with poems:

    Pomelo comes from Beijing City,
    Represents the people's heart,
    Smelling it can increase energy,
    Looking at it can add courage,
    The whole class guarantees,
    To bravely kill the enemy and protect peace.

    Every time we arrive at a station or position, we first see slogans and poems welcoming us and long lines welcoming us. For our safety, the leaders are always with us to every position.

    We asked to eat and live with the soldiers, but we were always treated with slaughtered pigs, chickens, fish, shrimp, and fruits. In the tunnels, the soldiers gave us the best places and their own beds to sleep on. Afraid that we would catch a cold at night, they constantly covered us with quilts. We held get-togethers together, told their heroic struggle stories, inscribed words, left messages, and wrote poems to each other. The soldiers gave us many cannon barrels, bullets, and shrapnel that they had earned with blood and sweat, as well as sheep that the soldiers had personally raised on the island and exotic flowers that bloomed on the positions. How precious these gifts are!

    We Are Always Together
    The most unforgettable thing is that several comrades in our慰问Performance Troupe were able to fire cannons on the Xiamen front lines and participate with the People's Liberation Army in the sacred battle of severely punishing the Chiang Kai-shek troops and warning the American imperialists. When they saw the Ministry of National Defense's order to resume shelling, they immediately submitted a request to the front-line command organs, which was quickly approved: "Your request is approved. You have a share in liberating Jinmen and Matsu and liberating Taiwan. Order you to set off immediately!" What exciting news this is! They immediately rushed to the artillery positions and were warmly welcomed by the soldiers. They patiently told them about the performance of the shells, how to load the shells, how to pull the trigger... Before long, the squad leader issued the order: "In order to defend the motherland, in order to liberate Taiwan, loved ones, prepare to fire the cannon—fire!" With a loud "Boom...", a flash of fire, a roaring shell flew towards Kinmen, and the smell of gunpowder filled the position. After they finished firing the cannons, they immediately embraced the soldiers and asked the squad leader to write their names on the squad's roster. They said, "We are considered enlisted, and we must remember the names of our comrades in the same squad. Their thoughts and feelings are completely integrated with those of the soldiers."

    Yes, we are with the soldiers, always together.

    我们在前线演出
    周巍峙  薛恩厚  孟希非
    首都文艺界福建前线慰问演出团在前方工作了一个月，共演出三百九十场。在前线时间并不长，但听到与亲眼看到解放军和英雄人民的许多英勇斗争事迹，使同志们受到了深刻的教育，有人反映：“过去也读过一些表现解放军的高贵品质的文章，但这次是亲自见了。”全团人员在整个慰问阶段，都是干劲十足，政治热情高涨，百分之百地完成了党和首都人民委托我们的光荣任务。因此，同志们一致认为，福建前线是座共产主义学校，解放军永远是我们学习的榜样。
    争取多为亲人演出
    我们以多演出，多加节目，多到最前线演出为荣。我们的口号是：“一切为了亲人”，我们的决心是：“不讲条件，不怕艰苦，不怕危险，哪里有士兵，就到哪里演出；有个地方，有个台儿就能演，就是黑天也能唱，悬崖可以演奏，阵地可以舞蹈、翻跟斗。”
    部队首长很注意我们这些文艺工作者的安全，要我们“服从组织”，不要“自由行动”。我们的口号是服从组织和竭力争取相结合。在8月中秋晚上我们刚赶到厦门市时，就争取到上前线的机会，有几个小组当晚赶到阵地上去，代表首都人民向战士们问候，为他们表演节目，在紧张的大炮声中和他们在一起欢度了佳节。
    “到最前沿的海岛上演出去”，可算是最激动人心的号召了。中国评剧院、北京人艺和青艺许多同志们都是以幸运的心情去完成了海岛慰问的光荣任务。
    海岛都不大，有的仅一、二平方里。我们一方面在炮兵阵地上进行分散和小型的慰问演出活动，同时也在坑道里为战士、指挥员和岛上的民兵、女自卫队员们，进行大型剧目的演出。中国评剧院的同志们到浯屿岛演出时听说战士们爱看现代戏，也想看传统剧目，就把“苦菜花”和“包公三勘”这两个大戏临时压缩成一个‘晚会’节目，为他们演出。演出的地方是一个上下左右不过二、三公尺见方的坑道的十字路口上。这个灯（汽灯）烛（蜡烛）辉煌的“前沿大礼堂”，仅容二百多人。三条通道是观众席，另一条通道作后台。十字道口的地方放不下桌椅板凳，更没有出将入相了，演员们出入场时会相互碰头，四个人物上场就得并肩表演。演员们为了亲人，也不顾坑道的凸凹不平照样走吊毛儿。为了满足全岛军民的看戏要求，就早、中、晚每日连演三场。
    我们到厦门的时候，天气多变，热起来要生痱子，冷起来要披上棉袄。这一切都不在演员的话下。虽然烈日晒烫了演员的耳环，台风堵塞着演员的歌唱，阴雨湿透了演员的服装，但烈日、台风、阴雨都还不能阻碍我们为亲人们演出。有一次演“智取威虎山”，为了隐蔽，是在一个不通风的地带演出的。这时天气极为闷热，战士们身着短裤褂还是汗流浃背；可是台上的演员都穿着老羊皮袄。相反的有一次天气骤转寒冷，战士们都披着棉袄来看戏，见到台上跳起孔雀舞来，演员都是穿一身轻纱，翩翩曼舞在舞台上的春天气氛里。战士们非常耽心演员可不要冷着！可是演员们并没感到冷。战士们感动地说：“你们太好了。”
    中央歌舞团那个队仅三十人，他们在前沿跑的路最长，点最多，也是争取每日演两场，一次演出往往到三小时至四小时。由于演员少，演出时间这样长，工作是非常紧张的，并且作到哪有战士就到哪去。如在前沿某指挥所活动结束之后，听说观测所还有两个同志值班。未能看到演出，同志们自动组织了一个小组，爬上了高地，在观测所为两个值班同志演了半个小时节目。中国京剧院的演员们在演完一场戏后，听说观众爱看戏，就自动加演节目。有时演到五小时到六小时。李和曾同志在坑道里主动征求战士意见：“我给大家唱一段，你们喜欢听什么？”有的战士说“喜欢空城计”，有的又提出“打渔杀家”，有的喜欢“除三害”，李和曾同志说：“那我就三个都唱吧！”战士们给他热烈鼓掌。
    演员们很会抓紧一切时机为亲人们演出，如欢送战士们走出剧场或广场的时候，给一时走不完的战士们再唱一段；有时战士们上了车，汽车发动不燃的时候，演员就为亲人们推汽车。另方面，在演员被战士们欢送上汽车的时候，演员还要为亲人们舞一阵金箍棒。
    哪里有战士，哪里去唱。我们为炊事员同志唱，为岗哨同志唱，为伤员唱，为疗养员唱，联欢起来和战士们一起唱。
    联欢、扯家常和写诗
    前沿分散活动好处多，能和战士打成一片，可以和战士座谈战斗故事，扯家常，联欢，写诗，留字，互赠礼品，形式活泼，情绪热烈；可以充分传达后方人民对前线战士的敬爱和关怀，报告全国大跃进的情况，这对战士是一个很大的鼓舞。通过交谈，可以知道许多英雄故事。通过英雄人物的亲身说法，对演出团的同志们起了很大的教育作用。同志们在和英雄见面后，干劲更大，情绪更加高涨，常常在深夜回来后还是热烈谈论，久久不眠。
    为了满足战士们各方面的要求，我们也进行了许多次大型和中型的演出。因为战士爱看戏，听说首都来了名演员，都想见见面，都想看个有头有尾的大戏。他们有轮休的时间，可以到“后方”的剧场里看大戏。有时还有个房子，二、三百人看戏很方便，那就进行中型演出，演它一、二个小时。这叫大、中、小结合。在大型演出时和观众的关系不像分散活动时那样亲切，演员们在演出后马上跑到观众席里，跑到剧场门口送观众，敲锣打鼓，喊口号，与战士们握别，欢送战士上车，那时场内场外情绪热烈，又形成一次相互慰问的高潮。有时这种动人的场面，会延长到五、六十分钟之久。后期还发展了给观众倒茶水，送观众时数快板。大家就用这种种的办法来密切和战士的关系，更好地完成慰问亲人的任务。
    前线分散演出要求形式多样，因此演员、乐队人员、舞台工作人员、行政领导干部都变成了多面手，不是唱就是说，总得贡献出一些节目来，否则要感到愧对亲人似的。因此，不但话剧演员要唱歌、说相声，数快板，歌舞演员要唱戏曲，就是京、评剧演员也高唱歌曲，大诵诗歌了。冯子存同志也不但吹“喜相逢”，而且也参加了京剧和评剧的伴奏工作了。
    为了更好的完成演出任务，更好地反映前线斗争，充分发挥艺术的宣传、教育和鼓舞作用，创作就成为全团同志共同任务。这次全团创作大小共二百六十四件。创作内容完全以歌颂英雄事迹，英雄人物，英雄连队等为主，到一个地方就写一个地方，因此战士反映很强烈。如在某部演唱该部事迹时，战士反映说：“你们刚来到这里，怎么对我们那么清楚，太棒了。”
    这些创作大大密切了剧团和战士们的关系，他们感到非常亲切，也充分的体现了后方人民对前方的关怀。如有的战士看过反映他们生活的小戏以后说：“我们在前线一点事情，首都人民都知道”。
    小小礼物表深情
    仅是演出还不能完全表达我们心意。演员们都准备了各种各样的小礼物，如毛主席像、北京风景照片、纪念章、日记本、烟、糖、辣酱和文旦（柚子）等，带到前沿阵地送给亲人。
    有的演员将国际青年联欢节的纪念糖给了一个班，战士们给糖起名叫“八仙丹”，意思是吃下去就有力量。有的连收下演员赠的日记本、图片礼物时，指导员对战士说：“谁打的好就给谁。”
    青艺演员把他们所带的礼物诗化了。如他们在赠战士的文旦上（即柚子）题上诗句，并和战士相互酬和、相互鼓舞。演员写着：
    文旦千片万片，
    片片代表人民心意。
    文旦、文旦，
    英雄同餐，
    收复金马，
    解放台湾。
    有的战士把文旦吃了，留着皮，有的战士舍不得吃，干脆将文旦用绳子拴在大炮上，并答诗：
    文旦来自北京城，
    代表人民一片心，
    嗅嗅可以增干劲，
    看看勇气加十分，
    全班集体来保证，
    英勇杀敌保和平。
    我们每到一驻地或一阵地，首先看到欢迎我们的标语、诗歌和列开长队欢迎我们。首长们为了我们的安全，时刻不离的陪着我们到各个阵地去。
    我们要求和战士同吃同住，但，总是杀猪、宰鸡、鱼、虾、水果的款待我们。在坑道里，战士们把最好的地方和自己的床铺让给我们睡，黑夜怕我们受凉，还不断地给我们掩铺盖。我们一起开联欢会，讲述他们的英勇斗争故事，互相题字、留言、和诗。战士们送给我们很多用血汗换来的炮弹筒、弹头、弹片，以及战士们在岛上亲自育养的羊和阵地上开放的奇花异卉。这些礼物是多么珍贵呵！
    我们永远在一起
    最难忘的是我们慰问演出团有几个同志能在厦门前线打了炮，同解放军在一起参加了严惩蒋军、警告美帝的神圣的战斗。当他们看到国防部恢复炮击的命令以后，立即向前线指挥机关提出了请求，很快就得到批准：“同意你们的请求，解放金门马祖，解放台湾有你们一份，命令你们，立刻出发！”这是多么令人兴奋的消息啊！他们马上赶到炮兵阵地上，受到战士们热烈的欢迎，他们耐心的告诉了炮弹的性能，如何装炮弹，如何拉火……不一会儿，班长就发布了口令：“为了保卫祖国，为了解放台湾，亲人们准备开炮——放！”“轰……”的一声巨响，火光一闪，一颗怒吼的炮弹飞向了金门，火药气味充满阵地。他们打完炮后，立刻和战士们拥抱到一起，还向班长要求把他们的名字也写在班的名单里面。他们说：“我们算是入伍了，我们要牢记住同班战友们的名字。他们和战士们的思想感情完全结合在一起了。”
    是的，我们是和战士们在一起的，永远在一起的。
