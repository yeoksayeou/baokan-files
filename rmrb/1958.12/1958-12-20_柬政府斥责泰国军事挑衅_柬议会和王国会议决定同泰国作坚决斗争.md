    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 18th: The Cambodian government issued a public statement on the evening of the 17th, formally accusing the Thai military authorities of provocative actions against Cambodia.

    The statement said that on November 26th and 27th, a Thai army invaded Cambodian territory and presumptuously claimed to "liberate" the Cambodian people from communism. They also said that Siem Reap and Battambang were Thai territories, and therefore they would occupy these two places. On November 28th, a Thai cavalry major and three Thai cavalrymen infiltrated the Cambodian border seven kilometers into the forest. On November 29th, another major led a team of Thai police forces across the border and opened fire on Cambodian troops inside Cambodian territory.

    The statement asked: Are these incidents not a pre-planned conspiracy to provoke border incidents against Cambodia?

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 18th: After Cambodia published a white paper on Cambodian-Thai relations, the National Assembly and the Royal Council of Cambodia held special meetings on the 17th respectively, and passed letters to the King and Queen of Cambodia. In the letters, they stated that they would resolutely fight against Thailand's provocative actions and devote their lives to upholding the good policies of the King, Queen, and Prince Sihanouk.

    The letters also requested the government to take measures to explain to the world the true face of the Thai government's provocative actions against Cambodia, and to explain Cambodia's attitude of fighting against all war provocations, because such provocations would plunge the world into anxiety.

    柬政府斥责泰国军事挑衅
    柬议会和王国会议决定同泰国作坚决斗争
    新华社金边18日电  柬埔寨政府在17日晚上发表公报，正式指责泰国军事当局对柬埔寨采取的挑衅行为。
    公报说，在11月26日和27日，有一支泰国军队侵入了柬埔寨领土，并且妄称要把柬埔寨人民从共产主义中“解放”出来。他们还说，暹粒和马德望是泰国的领土，因此他们将占领这两个地方。11月28日，有一名泰国骑兵少校同三名泰国骑兵潜入柬埔寨境内七公里的森林中。11月29日，另一名少校率领一队泰国警察部队越过边境，在柬埔寨境内同柬埔寨军队开火。
    公报问道：这些事件难道不是事先策划好的企图对柬埔寨挑起边境事件的阴谋吗？
    新华社金边18日电  柬埔寨国民议会和王国会议在柬埔寨发表了关于柬泰关系的白皮书以后，17日分别召开了特别会议，并且通过了给柬埔寨国王和王后的信。它们在信中表示，将同泰国的挑衅行为坚决进行斗争，并且毕生奉行国王、王后和西哈努克亲王的良好政策。
    信中还要求政府采取措施，向全世界说明泰国政府对柬埔寨采取的挑衅行为的真面目，并且说明柬埔寨将同一切战争挑衅行动作斗争的态度，因为这种挑衅行动将使世界陷于忧虑的情绪中。
