Recognize the True Face of the "Village Worthy"
Li Jun

The inaugural editorial of "Frontline," a publication sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is excellent. It makes us more clearly understand that to stand on the forefront of revolution and construction, we must oppose mediocrity and the "Village Worthy" style.

Indeed, a very small number of our comrades have been infected with this bad habit, and it is worth seriously treating. However, some people do not yet recognize this disease. They ask: What is a "Village Worthy"? What are the harms of a "Village Worthy"? In fact, the origin of the "Village Worthy" is long-standing, first spoken by Confucius, who said in the Yang Huo chapter of the Analects: "The Village Worthy is the thief of virtue." Mencius also made an explanation: "Those who obsequiously flatter the world are Village Worthies." This means that some people in the countryside outwardly pretend to be very restrained and refined, but in their hearts, they are two-faced and treacherous, hiding a dagger in their smile. The two characters "Village Worthy," "Village" refers to villagers, and "Worthy" indicates a restrained appearance. In today's language, a "Village Worthy" is a slick, opportunistic philistine, another name for a mediocre person. Although such people are in the minority in our current revolutionary ranks, they still exist. They often have an ambiguous and equivocal attitude between right and wrong, between the enemy and us, "generously tolerant," pleasing everyone. To superiors, to subordinates, no matter what kind of person, they have a set of methods to perfunctorily please people without offending them. What these people are constantly thinking about is personal gain, putting personal interests first and disregarding everything else. These people bring vulgar philistine behavior to the revolutionary ranks, seriously corroding the Party's organism and damaging the people's cause. This is what we cannot tolerate.

However, some people lack understanding of the harms of "Village Worthies," only seeing their superficially "amiable" appearance, and failing to recognize the true face of these hypocrites. This is because they have caught a cold and their sense of smell is not working.

There are also many people who think that although "Village Worthies" are not good, they are not necessarily so bad, and therefore often adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the "Village Worthy" style, not exposing it, not engaging in struggle. The inaugural editorial of "Frontline" is right: "Such people are the protectors of various evil trends and allies of rightists inside and outside the Party." Haven't we seen such people? In the anti-Rightist struggle, they showed indifference to the enemy's attacks, adhered to the doctrine of the mean, and valued harmony; they did not stand up and resolutely fight to defend the Party's interests, actually losing their position and greatly helping the Rightists. In ordinary times, we also often encounter the shadow of "Village Worthies": minding their own business, staying out of trouble, seeking self-preservation, and only seeking to avoid mistakes; turning a blind eye to behavior that harms the Party's interests, acting as if nothing happened. They lack a basic sense of responsibility for the Party's cause, and the only thing they care about is personal "votes" and popularity. Various evil trends naturally develop around such people, bringing serious losses to the work.

Now we should no longer adopt a laissez-faire and numb attitude towards "Village Worthies." We should at least be more enlightened than Mencius. When answering Wan Zhang's question about "Village Worthies," Mencius said: "Agreeing with vulgar customs, conforming to a corrupt world, appearing to be loyal and trustworthy, acting as if incorruptible, pleasing everyone; thinking that they are right, and cannot enter the way of Yao and Shun. Therefore, it is said that they are thieves of virtue." Although Mencius had some understanding of the true face of "Village Worthies," he had not completely seen through them. Now that we have seen that "Village Worthies" are actually the protectors of various evil trends and allies of rightists inside and outside the Party, then how harmful it would be to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards "Village Worthies" is not obvious?

### 识破“乡原”的真面目

    识破“乡原”的真面目
    李筠
    中共北京市委主办的刊物“前线”的发刊词写得很好，它使我们更清楚地懂得：要站在革命和建设的最前线，必须反对中庸主义和“乡原”作风。
    我们确有极少数同志沾染上了这种坏毛病，值得认真地医治一番。但是，有的人还不大认识这种病症，他们问：什么是“乡原”？“乡原”有些什么害处？其实，“乡原”的由来已久，最早出自孔子之口，他在论语阳货篇里说道：“乡原，德之贼也”。孟子还做过一番解释：“阉然媚于世也者，是乡原也”。这个意思是指乡村中有些人外表上装着很拘谨、很斯文的样子，骨子里却是三面两刃，笑里藏刀，别具心肝。“乡原”二字，“乡”是指乡人，“原”是表示拘谨的样子。用现在的话来说，“乡原”就是贼光油滑、八面玲珑的市侩，中庸主义者的别名。这种人在我们现在的革命队伍中虽是少数，也还是存在的。他们在是非之间、敌我之间，往往态度暧昧，模棱两可，“雍容大度”，八面讨好。对上级，对下级，无论对什么样的人，都有一套不得罪人的敷衍讨好的办法。这种人所念念不忘的，只是个人得失，把个人利益放在首位而不顾其他。这些人把庸俗的市侩作风带到革命队伍中来，严重地腐蚀着党的机体，损害着人民的事业。这是我们所不能容忍的。
    但是，有些人对于“乡原”的害处缺乏认识，只看到他们表面上“蔼然可亲”的神气，没有识破这些伪君子的真面目。这是患了伤风感冒，嗅觉不灵的原故。
    还有许多人，认为“乡原”虽然不好，但未必有那么坏，因而对“乡原”作风往往采取姑息的态度，不去揭穿，不进行斗争。“前线”的发刊词说得对：“这种人是各种歪风邪气的庇护者，党内外右派的同盟军”。我们不是曾经见到过这样的人吗？他们在反右派斗争中，对敌人的进攻表现了麻木不仁，抱定中庸之道，以和为贵；不是挺身而出，为捍卫党的利益进行坚决斗争，实际上失掉了立场，大大帮了右派的忙。在平时，我们也经常的碰到“乡原”的影子：事不关己，高高挂起，明哲保身，但求无过；对于损害党的利益的行为，听之任之，行若无事。他们缺乏对党的事业的起码责任感，而唯一关心的却是个人的“选票”和人缘。各种歪风邪气很自然地在这种人的周围发展起来，给工作带来了严重的损失。
    现在我们再也不应该对“乡原”采取姑息和麻痹的态度了。我们起码要比孟子高明一些吧。在回答万章关于“乡原”的问题时，孟子说过：“同乎流俗，合乎污世，居之似忠信，行之似廉洁，众皆悦之；自以为是，而不可与入尧舜之道。故曰德之贼也”。孟子对于乡原的真面目虽然有所认识，却还没有完全看透。我们现在既然看到了“乡原”实际上是各种歪风、邪气的庇护者，是党内外右派的同盟军，那末，对于“乡原”采取姑息的态度该是多么有害，难道不是显而易见的吗？
