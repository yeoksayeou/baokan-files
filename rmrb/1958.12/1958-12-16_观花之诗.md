Poems on Observing Flowers
Xie Juezai

Seeing the Henan Wheat High-Yield Exhibition Hall
	Wheat gate, wheat tower, wheat king,
	Large grains, thick stalks, strong tillering.
	To introduce the bumper harvest, rhythmic verses are needed,
	Every girl is a poetry maiden.

Note: The exhibition hall has a Tiananmen made of wheat and a pagoda made of wheat. One wheat plant tillered into forty-five ears and is called the Wheat King.

Ancient Xing People's Commune in the Suburbs of Zhengzhou
	Asking the child under the cotton plant, he says Mom has gone to pick cotton.
	Only in this field, the cotton is so deep she is nowhere to be seen.
	Planting cotton for sixty years, never have I seen such good cotton,
	The drier it is, the more vigorous it becomes, singing poems to me.

The above two poems are about high-yield cotton experimental fields. Old Comrade Yue Weihan, the group leader managing the high-yield cotton, has been planting cotton since he was a child. We asked him about his management experience, and he said: I have compiled it into a clapper talk, "Listen to me sing it!"

	The wheat field is flat as far as the eye can see, ridges and paths clearly defined.
	Deep plowing one and a half feet, the fertilizer is abundant, and the seedlings are green.

Seeing the Happiness Home of the Ancient Xing Commune
	Previously lacking clothing and food, now clothing and food are sufficient.
	The houses they live in are very good, and there are service personnel.
	The old people: some sing loudly,
			some have tears of gratitude.
	All say:
		May Chairman Mao live a long life!

Cafeteria of the Songyue People's Commune
	Eating is free, the cafeteria is temporarily open-air,
	Twenty-one kinds of food, let's see who can eat them all "xuan".

Note: The cooks took out various wheat-based foods and asked us to taste them, saying there were twenty-one kinds, which could be eaten in rotation for a week. They are preparing to build a cafeteria in the winter. "Xuan" is a Dengfeng dialect word meaning good.

Visiting Songyue Temple
	The Mountain God has not been hailed for a long time,
	Six hundred million people sing with full bellies.
	Ancient cypresses lean against ancient stones,
	Flying immortals vividly ride celestial geese. (Note)
	The incense in the furnace is cold, leaving embers,
	The dust in the seat seals the passing waves.
	The Taoist priests have long abandoned their alchemy scrolls,
	This autumn, they have harvested abundant grains and vegetables.

Note: The temple has a Three Immortals Shrine, said to be built in the Tang Dynasty, with beautiful sculptures and paintings.

Listening to the Introduction of Work in Henan Province
	From prevention being more important than rescue, to taking steel as the key link.
	Man can conquer nature, with the key link, everything falls into place.
	Numbers change every day, satellites are all strong.
	Old people and children, everything they say is well-organized.

	Ideology is the soul, only by breaking can one establish.
	Half breaking is not solid, continuous breaking requires continuous establishing.
	Launch big-character posters in a big way, to expose the contradictions.
	The whole people break and establish in a big way, only then is strength limitless.

In Changsha (Waves Washing Sand)
	Seeing the female students of Changsha Women's Normal School (teacher training school) departing to work in various communes, using Principal Jiang Guoren's tune for his 62nd birthday

	Beside the giant smelting furnace, it is extraordinary. Intelligence is not weak, and the body is strong. Wielding shovels and hammers, steel girls.
	The spry old Zhou Jiang, with earnest intentions. Grandmothers' careers must be comprehensive. Millions of children need to be educated, let you specialize in it.

Changsha School for the Blind
	Blind people use their hands as eyes,
	Production plans are accurate.
	Fingers move like flying,
	Able to connect wires and weave flowers.
	They brought a stack of ledgers,
	Filled with dense writing.

At the Nanning Revolutionary History Museum
	Splendid historical traces are painstakingly collected,
	For a hundred years, there have been many righteous and heroic people.
	The Heavenly Kingdom failed, and popular resentment accumulated,
	For ten years, Xiujing was called a battle.

Note: The Great Cheng Kingdom was established after the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, led by Chen Kai, Wang Dingfeng, etc. They established Xiujing in Guiping, launched an uprising in 1854, and failed in 1864.

	With a crash of thunder, the sky is about to dawn,
	Pan Ren is reborn, and the land is returned.
	Feng Fushan's great flag is treasured,
	From now on, the Yao people will no longer "cross the mountains."

Note: In 1933, the Yao people in northern Guangxi launched an uprising, led by Feng Fushan. He survived the failure and is now in his sixties, serving as the deputy director of the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Guilin Prefecture. The ancestor of the Yao people is Pan Ren. In the past, the Yao people lived nomadically, wherever they went, they reclaimed wasteland. Because the mountains belonged to the landlords, they moved to another place every two or three years, called "crossing the mountains Yao." The Yao people have a song: "The nine continents and four seas all belong to the king, where is Pan Ren's sacred land? Where is the Yao people's mountain? Thanks to the Communist Party, we are no longer vagrants, 'crossing the mountains Yao no longer cross the mountains'." Feng Fushan's uprising flag is 654 cm long and 651 cm wide, with the words "Great Flag" written in the middle, surrounded by many images of gods, and in the middle is Sun Yat-sen. There is also a proclamation of the Grand President of the Fengtian Army, all stored in the museum. Mr. Feng talked about the difficulties of the Yao people's oppression and their resistance. He said: Now is the second Pan Gu, everything is good. We are very grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for their care for ethnic minorities.

	Victory is still an alliance under the city,
	The army and the people swallow their voices.
	Lord Liu's remaining ink retains heroic spirit,
	The character "Tiger" circles in one stroke.

Note: The museum has a portrait of General Feng Zicai and the character "Tiger" written by General Liu Yongfu.

	The Longzhou flag is the most distinctive,
	How many heroes' blood has dyed it.
	The blood debt must be settled clearly,
	The accomplice still has little Gordon.

Note: The Longzhou Soviet failed. At that time, the Kuomintang newspapers reported that French imperialist planes had assisted in the battle.

Hearing about the Bumper Harvest in Huanjiang
	Huanjiang experimental field, yield of 130,000 catties per mu.
	There are also 960 mu, averaging 18,000 catties.
	Soil, water, fertilizer, seed, density, people can stand on the rice.
	Became the king of rice, and also became a steel hero.
	The whole county set a plan to smelt 3 million catties of iron.
	Believe it or not, Huanjiang is doing it.

Note: The experimental field of the Red Flag Commune yielded 130,430 catties and 4 taels of rice per mu. The Red Sun Commune has harvested more than 969 mu of medium rice, with an average yield of nearly 18,000 catties per mu.

Presented to the Students of Guangxi Nationalities Institute
	A round of red sun soars,
	A thousand years of dark clouds vanish.
	The Hongshui River is forever clear, and the fish send messages from afar,
	Although the Yao Mountains are dangerous, my heart is at peace.
	Reclaiming fields and planting trees moves the earth,
	Good at dancing and singing, even the moon lingers.
	Study well and work hard,
	Also seek love by the lake.

Written for Students of Guangxi University, Guangxi Petroleum School, and Guangxi Agricultural College
	College farms and factories,
	Students, peasants, and workers.
	Physical and mental strength are tempered together,
	Theory is renewed through practice.
	Labor produces new things, and new people,
	Suntanned skin and a reddened heart.
	Dare to break and dare to establish, dare to think and dare to do.
	Rushing on the road to
	Socialism - Communism.

Reading the Brief Biography of Martyr Wei Baqun
	Traitors and villains have turned to dust,
	Victory has finally returned to the wheel of history.
	Unbowed and unyielding, carry it through to the end,
	Brother Ba lives forever in people's hearts.

Guilin Scenic Spots
	Who has set up the checkerboard,
	The pieces are jagged and carved with axes.
	Green water ripples like a belt,
	The people are just like a picture.
	Let the thousand-year myth circulate,
	Human will can still conquer nature.
	Pull out the sword and let the benevolent elephant walk, (Note 1)
	Sing loudly and let the lazy dragon sleep. (Note 2)

Note 1: Elephant Trunk Hill. Legend has it that a kind-hearted elephant used to control water and prevent drought for the people. Later, an angel tricked him into drinking water by the river, and inserted a sword into his back, so the elephant could not leave. Now there is a pagoda in the shape of a sword handle on the mountain.
Note 2: Dragon Hidden Rock. Legend has it that a lazy dragon used to sleep inside. The Zhuang folk song fairy Liu Sanjie sang a song to him: "The lazy dragon sleeps in the cave day and night, just like a lazy snake's skin. Why not fly to the nine heavens, with good weather, everyone will call you Dragon Grandpa." The dragon was moved and broke through the stone and flew away.

	A turn around Rong Lake and Shan Lake,
	Took one and a half hours.
	Ancient trees and light boats reflecting each other,
	Red bridges and winding paths connecting.
	Although the trees are old,
	The crowd points to Grandpa Banyan.
	Although Grandma has passed away,
	She can still have children and grandchildren.

Note: Rong Lake has two ancient banyan trees, which residents call Grandpa Banyan and Grandma Banyan. Grandma Tree has died, and a Banyan Shade Pavilion has been built on its site.

Written for the Cafeteria of the Guilin North Station People's Commune
	Steaming rice in bowls stacked on top of each other, hot rice paired with stir-fried dishes.
	Rice is rationed by the person, dishes are chosen as you like.
	Five cents, one dime, five cents, both meat and vegetables are fully prepared.
	Compared to cooking yourself, it's faster, better, cheaper, and cleaner.

    观花之诗
    谢觉哉
    看河南小麦丰产展览馆

    越干越有劲，对我唱诗篇。
    右二首咏高产棉试验田。管理高产棉的组长岳惟翰老同志，从小就种棉的，我们问他管理的经验，他说：我已把它编成快板，“听我唱来”！
    麦田一望平，畦珑路分明。
    深耕一尺五，肥大苗儿青。
    看古荥公社的幸福院
    以前缺衣缺食，而今衣食周全。
    住的房子很好，还有服务人员。
    老人们：有的高声歌唱，
            有的感激泪涟。
    都说：
          祝毛主席长寿万年！

    吃饭不要钱，食堂暂露天，

    全民大破立，力量才无极。
    在长沙（浪淘沙）
    看长沙女子师范钢铁及幼儿师范学生出发到各公社工作，用姜国仁校长六二自寿调

    全县定计划，炼铁三百万。
    信不信由你，环江正在干。
    注：红旗公社试验田，亩产水稻十三万零四百三十斤四两。红日公社已收中稻九百六十九亩多，平均亩产近一万八千斤。
  赠广西民族学院同学
    一轮红日飞腾日，
    千载阴云消逝时。
    红水永清鱼信远，
    瑶山虽险我心夷。
    垦田植树地为动，
    善舞能歌月亦迟。
    学习好兼劳动好，
    还从湖畔觅相思。
