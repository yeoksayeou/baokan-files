Bi-Monthly International Review
(November 16th to 30th)

The Great Program of the Soviet Union for Building Communism

The Soviet Union recently announced the draft report of Comrade Khrushchev on the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965" to be delivered at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, for nationwide discussion. This is a great program for the Soviet Union to stride towards communism. It has shaken the world with its unprecedented scale and astonishing speed of development.

After implementing a series of major reforms in recent years, the Soviet Union has now entered the most important stage of development in carrying out communist construction. This is also the decisive stage in the peaceful competition with the capitalist world. In this stage, the Soviet Union will solve the basic economic task, namely, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output value. This task is expected to be completed within the next fifteen years. By that time, the Soviet Union will be the first in the world not only in terms of total output value, but also in terms of per capita output value. This means that by that time the Soviet Union will be able to more fully meet the material and spiritual needs of the people. The seven-year plan for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965 is an important component of the Soviet Union's long-term plan for the next fifteen years.

"We must win time in the peaceful economic competition with the most developed capitalist countries," is the starting point of the Soviet seven-year plan. Therefore, the plan emphasizes: developing the economy at the fastest possible speed, especially the production sectors that are of decisive significance. Compared with 1958, in the next seven years, the Soviet Union's heavy industries such as steel, petroleum, electricity, the chemical industry, and machine manufacturing will increase by 65% to two times, light industry will increase by half, and daily necessities will double. By the end of the seven-year plan, the Soviet Union's output of some industrial products and the most important agricultural products, both in terms of total output and per capita output, will approach or exceed the existing production level of the United States. The Soviet seven-year plan will further improve the cultural living standards of the Soviet people; at the same time, it will bring Soviet workers the shortest working day system in the world, that is, a six or seven-hour working day system with two days of rest per week. This plan presents an inspiring and beautiful picture to the people of the world.

The completion of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will not only enhance the power of the Soviet Union, but also further strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp and the forces of world peace. For this reason, the announcement of this great plan has made friends extremely happy and enemies panic-stricken. The Soviet seven-year plan has been hailed by the people of the socialist camp and all peace-loving people in the world. Faced with the fact that the Soviet economy is booming, the American bourgeois press has had to admit that if the Soviet seven-year plan is realized, "the communist world will obviously win the economic competition with the West." The Soviet seven-year plan once again proves that the development of socialism cannot be stopped by any force. In the peaceful competition with the capitalist world, socialism will inevitably win.

The Japanese People are Fighting Against the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"

In the past half month, the Japanese people's struggle against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government, centered on the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," has formed a prairie fire. Under the strong opposition of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government had to make some concessions to domestic public opinion. On November 22, Kishi Nobusuke, as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, agreed in talks with the leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party on the Japanese political situation to temporarily shelve the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" as a "pending deliberation" bill. This is a preliminary victory for the massive mass struggle of the Japanese people in the past two months.

However, the Kishi Nobusuke government and some groups within the Liberal Democratic Party have not abandoned their ambition to revive militarism and rebuild a police state. They still intend to submit a disguised "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill" to the regular session of the Diet, which will begin on December 10. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government is stepping up its suppression of the Japanese people who oppose the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law." The Metropolitan Police Department of the Kishi government, on the pretext of violating the "Tokyo Metropolitan Public Safety Ordinance" and the "Road Traffic Control Law," arrested many leaders of mass movements, such as the Minister of Youth of the Socialist Party, the Chairman of the Socialist Student League, the Secretary-General of the Hokuriku Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union, and the members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Student Self-Government Federation; tens of thousands of workers, staff, and students who participated in the joint struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" on November 5 were unreasonably punished with suspension, expulsion, salary cuts, warnings, and so on. In addition, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party also intends to formulate new fascist laws to suppress the Japanese people who dare to express their opinions to the Diet.

It is no accident that the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted such reactionary measures in its domestic policy. This is to clear the way for the soon-to-be-completed Japan-U.S. military alliance and to prepare conditions for Japan to embark on the road of militarism and imperialism. On November 19, Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi sharply pointed out in a statement on the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" the conspiracy of the Japan-U.S. reactionaries: First, in the name of joint defense, Japan is to assume the obligation of protecting U.S. military bases; second, the joint defense area is to be expanded to the Western Pacific; third, in the event of an emergency, Japan is to be dragged into a war of nuclear weapons to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States.

Currently, facing an increasingly serious domestic political crisis, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government is trying to further rely on the United States and reorganize its forces with the support of its U.S. master. The U.S. aggressors, who have suffered successive defeats in the Middle East and the Far East, are also eager to find a capable helper in the East to take the lead for them and use Asians to fight Asians. This is why the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government are so eager to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kishi government has drafted the Japanese draft on November 17, named the Japan-U.S. "Joint Assistance Treaty," and Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama has stated that he wants to "substantially reach an agreement" with the United States by the end of this year or early next year.

However, the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is, after all, a major issue related to the destiny of the Japanese nation. All Japanese people who hope for independence, peace, and democracy are continuing their efforts to smash the Kishi Nobusuke government's sinister conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that enslaves the Japanese people, and break free from the colonial shackles of the San Francisco Treaty system.

Berlin Should Be a Berlin for Germans

On November 27, the Soviet government sent notes to the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, suggesting the elimination of the Berlin occupation system and making West Berlin a free city. On the same day, Soviet Premier Khrushchev further elaborated on the Soviet government's proposal at a press conference in Moscow. On the 28th, German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl made a statement, expressing full agreement with the Soviet government's proposal in the note to the five countries on the Berlin issue to normalize the situation in Berlin.

The Soviet government's proposal is of urgent importance to promoting the reunification of Germany and easing tensions in Europe. Since the end of the war, Western countries and the West German government have deliberately undermined the Potsdam Agreement. In West Germany and West Berlin, German militarism has been revived with the support of Western countries. They have tried their best to use the Western countries' occupation system of West Berlin to turn West Berlin into a base for sabotaging and subverting the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, and into a "frontline city" deep inside the German Democratic Republic. This has turned West Berlin into a malignant tumor that endangers German unity and European peace. The Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue provides a practical and feasible way to solve this important problem. It will not only help normalize the situation in Berlin, but also help promote understanding and rapprochement between the two Germanys, and it is also conducive to establishing and consolidating peace in Europe and the world.

Therefore, the Soviet government's proposal has been welcomed and supported by the German people and broad world public opinion. The people of West Berlin, who have suffered deeply from the occupation system, pointed out that now is the time to withdraw all occupying forces and restore normal life to Berlin. Even Western news agencies had to admit that the Soviet proposal "has considerable appeal to the world."

However, the Soviet government's proposal made Western countries, especially the United States, feel "shocked and uneasy." When Soviet Premier Khrushchev first proposed the elimination of the remnants of the occupation of Berlin on November 10, Western countries put forward so-called inherent "rights of occupation" of Berlin and "solemn obligations to control West Berlin" to defend their continued occupation of West Berlin. The United States even arrogantly threatened to "resort to force if necessary." But one cannot help but ask, what is the purpose of this occupation of Berlin and the "solemn obligation to control West Berlin"? Isn't it precisely to thoroughly eradicate German militarism in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, so that it will no longer endanger world peace? Since Western countries have undermined the Potsdam Agreement with their own actions, what right do they have to continue occupying West Berlin?

Now, under the pressure of the broad masses of people demanding acceptance of the Soviet proposal, Western countries are in a very difficult situation. But they are still unwilling to accept the Soviet proposal. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on November 27, saying that the United States does not want to give up its "right" to occupy West Berlin. British officials also said that the Soviet proposal was "unacceptable." There are reports that Western countries may deliberately delay responding to the Soviet note, while preparing to create some "counter-proposals" to reject the Soviet's reasonable proposal, in an attempt to escape the condemnation of the people of the world. However, no matter how Western countries try to undermine the Soviet's peaceful proposal, the occupation system of West Berlin should be ended, foreign troops must withdraw from West Berlin, Berlin must be a Berlin for Berliners, and must be a Berlin for Germans!

    半月国际述评
    （十一月十六日至三十日）
    苏联建设共产主义的伟大纲领
    苏联最近公布了赫鲁晓夫同志将在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上作的“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”报告提纲，以便进行全民讨论。这是苏联向共产主义大踏步前进的伟大纲领。它以空前巨大的规模和惊人的发展速度震动了世界。
    苏联在近年来实行了一系列的重大改革之后，目前已进入了开展共产主义建设的最重要的发展阶段。这也就是同资本主义世界进行和平竞赛的具有决定性意义的阶段。在这阶段中，苏联将要解决基本经济任务，即在按人口平均计算的产值方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。这个任务预计将在今后十五年内完成。到那时候，苏联不仅在总产值方面，而且在按人口平均计算的产值方面都将居世界第一位。这就意味着：到那时候苏联就能更加充分地满足人民的物质和精神的需要。1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济七年计划就是苏联今后十五年远景计划的重要组成部分。
    “必须在同最发达的资本主义国家进行的和平经济竞赛中赢得时间”，这是苏联七年计划的出发点。因此，计划中强调：以最快的速度发展经济，特别是具有决定意义的生产部门。同1958年比较，今后七年中，苏联的重工业钢、石油、电力、化学工业和机器制造业等将分别增加65％到二倍，轻工业将增加半倍，日用生活必需品将增加一倍。到七年计划结束时，苏联的某些工业产品和最重要的农产品，不论在总产量方面或按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将接近或超过美国现有的生产水平。苏联的七年计划，将进一步提高苏联人民的文化生活水平；同时给苏联职工带来世界上最短的工作日制度，即每周有两天休息的六、七小时工作日的制度。这个计划在全世界人民面前展现了一幅鼓舞人心的美好图景。
    苏联发展国民经济七年计划的完成不仅将增强苏联的威力，而且将进一步加强整个社会主义阵营的威力和世界和平的力量。正因为如此，这个伟大的计划的公布，使朋友高兴异常，使敌人惊慌万状。苏联七年计划受到社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的欢呼。而面对着苏联经济蓬勃发展的事实，美国资产阶级报刊也不得不承认：如果苏联七年计划实现，“共产主义世界显然就会在同西方的经济竞赛中获得胜利”。苏联七年计划再一次证明，社会主义的发展是任何力量也不能够阻止的。在同资本主义世界的和平竞赛中，社会主义必然会获得胜利。
    日本人民为反对修改日美“安全条约”而斗争
    这半个月，日本人民反对岸信介政府以修改“警察官职务执行法”为中心的反动政策的斗争，已形成烈火燎原之势。岸信介政府在日本人民的强烈反对下，不得不向国内舆论作些让步。11月22日，岸信介作为执政的自由民主党的总裁，在同日本社会党领袖就日本政局问题进行的会谈中，同意把“警职法修正案”作为
  “审议未了”的法案暂时搁置起来。这是日本人民近两月来轰轰烈烈的群众斗争的初步胜利。
    但是，岸信介政府和自由民主党内部的一些集团，并没有放弃他们复活军国主义、重建警察国家的野心。他们仍打算向将在12月10日开始举行的国会平时会议再次提出变相的“警职法修正案”。与此同时，岸信介政府加紧镇压反对修改“警职法”的日本人民。岸政府的警视厅以违反“东京都公安条例”和“公路交通取缔法”等为借口，逮捕了社会党青年部长、社会主义学生同盟委员长、国营铁道工会北陆地方本部书记长、东京都学生自治会联合会委员等许多群众运动的领导人；上万名参加过11月5日举行的反对修改“警职法”联合斗争的工人、职员、学生，分别遭到当局给予停职、停学、减薪、警告……种种无理处分。另外，执政的自由民主党还打算制订新的法西斯法律，来镇压敢于向国会表示意见的日本人民。
    岸信介政府在对内政策上采取这种反动措施，决不是偶然的。这是为执行即将完成的日美军事同盟扫清道路，为日本走上军国主义和帝国主义的道路准备条件。11月19日我国外交部长陈毅，在关于日美修改“安全条约”的声明中尖锐地指出了日美反动派的阴谋：第一步，借共同防御之名，要日本承担保卫美国军事基地的义务；第二步，把共同防御地区扩大到西太平洋；第三步，一旦有事，把日本拖进一场核武器的战争，替美国火中取栗。
    目前，面临着日益严重的国内政治危机的日本岸信介政府，正想进一步投靠美国，在美国主子的撑腰下重整旗鼓。而在中东和远东连续遭到失败的美国侵略者，也急于要在东方物色一个得力帮手，来替它顶头阵，用亚洲人打亚洲人。这就是日本岸信介政府和美国政府为什么急于修改日美“安全条约”的原因。岸政府的外务省在11月17日已拟订了日方草案，定名为日美“共同援助条约”，日本外务相藤山表示要在今年年底或明年年初同美国“大体上达成协议”。
    但是，日美“安全条约”的修改毕竟是有关日本民族命运的重大问题。一切希望独立、和平和民主的日本人民，正再接再厉，为粉碎岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的罪恶阴谋、废除奴役日本人民的“日美安全条约”、挣脱旧金山和约体制的殖民枷锁而斗争。
    柏林应该是德国人的柏林
    11月27日，苏联政府向美英法和西德及德意志民主共和国分别发出照会，建议消除柏林占领制度和使西柏林成为自由城市。同一天，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上又详细地阐述了苏联政府的这一建议。28日，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥发表谈话，表示完全赞同苏联政府就柏林问题致五国照会中所提出的使柏林局势正常化的建议。
    苏联政府的这一建议，对于促进德国的重新统一以及缓和欧洲紧张局势有着迫切的重要意义。战后以来，西方国家和西德政府蓄意破坏波茨坦协定，在西德和西柏林，德国军国主义得到西方国家的支持又重新复活起来。它们竭力利用西方国家对西柏林的占领制度，把西柏林变成一个破坏和颠复民主德国和其他社会主义国家的基地，变成一个深入民主德国内部的“前线城市”。这就使西柏林成了一个危害德国统一和欧洲和平的毒瘤。苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议，为解决这一重要问题提供了切实可行的途径。它不仅有助于促使柏林局势的正常化，有利于促进两个德国的谅解和接近，并且也有利于建立和巩固欧洲和世界的和平。
    因此，苏联政府的这一建议受到了德国人民和广大世界舆论的欢迎和支持。深受占领制度痛苦的西柏林人民更指出：现在应该是撤退所有占领军并且使柏林重新获得正常生活的时候了。甚至连西方通讯社也不得不承认苏联的建议“对世界有相当大的吸引力”。
    但是，苏联政府的建议使西方国家特别是美国感到“震惊和不安”。当11月10日苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫首次提出结束占领柏林制度的残余的建议时，西方国家提出所谓对柏林的固有的“占领权利”以及“管制西柏林的庄严义务”来为它们继续占领西柏林辩护。美国甚至蛮横地以“必要时诉诸武力”来妄图威吓。但是人们不禁要问，这种对柏林的占领和“管制西柏林的庄严义务”的目的是什么呢？难道不正是根据波茨坦协定彻底铲除德国军国主义，使它们不再危害世界和平吗？西方国家既然以自己的行动破坏了波茨坦协定，还有什么权利继续占领西柏林呢？
    现在，在广大人民要求接受苏联建议的压力下面，西方国家处于十分困难的境地。但是他们仍然不愿意接受苏联的建议。美国国务院11月27日发表声明，表示美国不想放弃它占领西柏林的“权利”。英国的官员也表示苏联的建议是“不能接受的”。有消息说，西方国家可能故意拖延对苏联照会的答复，同时准备制造什么“反建议”来拒绝苏联的合理建议，企图借此逃避全世界人民对他们的谴责。但是，不管西方国家怎样企图破坏苏联的这个和平建议，西柏林的占领制度是应该结束了，外国军队必须从西柏林撤走，柏林必须是柏林人的柏林，必须是德国人的柏林！
