	Two or Three Things About Measles

	The winter and spring seasons are periods of significant climate change, making them seasons when measles easily occurs and spreads. Recently, measles cases have been found in many places, and there is a continuing trend of infection and spread. Therefore, how to do a good job in the prevention and care of measles is a concern for many people.

	Measles is one of the most common acute infectious diseases in the world that specifically affects children. The pathogen of measles is a filterable virus. It is spread through the saliva expelled by patients during breathing, talking, and coughing into the surrounding air, and then infects healthy children. The most important thing to prevent measles infection is to be careful not to take children to the homes of patients or crowded places. At the same time, pay attention to climate changes, dress appropriately for the weather, keep the body and bedding clean, and get plenty of sunshine in fresh air to enhance resistance, so as to avoid the “taking advantage of weakness” by germs and easy onset of the disease when the body is weak.

	The younger the child who contracts measles, the weaker their resistance, and the greater the danger. Therefore, the age of onset should be delayed as much as possible. Some parents believe that: everyone has to get measles once anyway, so it is better to let the child get it earlier. Therefore, they neglect prevention and even deliberately let their children come into contact with patients. This is extremely wrong. Now, in medicine, methods such as injecting blood from adults who have had measles and taking purple gromwell root water can be used for prevention. However, this cannot immediately produce sufficient immunity, so attention should still be paid to prevention and isolation.

	If a child is infected with measles, they should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible and given extra care, so as to avoid complications such as pneumonia, otitis media, encephalitis, nephritis, and malnutrition due to improper care.

	The incubation period of measles is about ten days. Rashes can be seen three or four days after the onset of the disease. Fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes are symptoms of measles. When the rash first appears, it usually starts on the forehead, behind the ears, and on the neck, and then spreads to all parts of the body. After three or four days, the rash and fever gradually subside, and a layer of skin flakes off the body.

	Currently, there is no specific medicine that can cure measles. As long as the care is proper and there are no other complications, there is no danger. After being diagnosed with measles, do not go out to seek medical treatment. You should rest at home and ask a nearby doctor to come to your home for treatment, so as to avoid infection with other diseases. The room of a child with measles should be kept warm, but also well-ventilated to keep the indoor air fresh. The room should not be too dry. During the rash period, do not force the child to eat if they do not want to. Even if they do eat something, it should be light liquid and semi-liquid food. Drinking plenty of boiled water and washing the eyes with boric acid water are both good for maintaining the cleanliness of the mouth and eyes.

    有关麻疹二三事
    冬春两季气候变化较大，是麻疹容易发生和流行的季节。最近许多地方都发现了麻疹病儿，并且有继续传染蔓延之势。因此如何作好麻疹的预防和护理工作，是很多人所关心的。
    麻疹是世界上最普遍的专门侵犯儿童的急性传染病之一。麻疹的病原体是滤过性病毒。它借着患者的呼吸，谈话和咳嗽时所排除的唾沫而散布到周围的空气中，然后传染给健康的儿童。预防麻疹的感染，最重要的是应注意不要把孩子带到患者的家和人多拥挤的地方去。同时要注意气候的变化，穿衣服冷暖要合适，身体和衣被都要保持清洁，多在空气新鲜的地方晒晒太阳，以增强抵抗力，免得体弱时病菌“乘虚而入”和容易发病。
    患麻疹的儿童，年龄愈小，抵抗力愈弱，危险性就愈大，所以应该尽量推迟发病年龄。有些父母认为：反正每个人都要出一次麻疹，还不如让孩子早些出了更好，因此就疏于防范，甚至故意让孩子去接触病人，这是极端错误的。现在在医药上还可以采取注射已患过麻疹的成人的血液，和内服紫草根水等办法来预防。但是不能因此就马上产生出足够的免疫力，所以还应注意预防隔离。
    孩子感染上了麻疹，应该及早诊治和加意护理，以免因为护理不当而引起肺炎、中耳炎、脑炎、肾炎和营养不良症等疾病。
    麻疹的潜伏期约十天左右。发病后三、四天，就可见到皮疹。发烧、咳嗽、流清鼻涕和眼泪汪汪的现象，就是出麻疹的征状。皮疹初出，多从前额、耳后颈部开始，然后遍及身体各部。三、四天后，疹和烧渐退去，身体上脱一层皮屑。
    目前，还没有什么特效药可以治疗麻疹。只要护理得法，不并发其他病症，是不会有什么危险的。诊断为麻疹后，不要再到外面去就医，应在家里静养和请附近的医生到家里去治，以免再感染其他疾病。麻疹病儿的住室应保持温暖，但也要注意通风，使室内空气新鲜。室内不要太干燥。发疹期间，如果不想吃东西，不要勉强。即使吃一些也以清淡流质和半流质食品为宜。多喝开水和用硼酸水洗眼对保持口腔和眼的清洁都有好处。
