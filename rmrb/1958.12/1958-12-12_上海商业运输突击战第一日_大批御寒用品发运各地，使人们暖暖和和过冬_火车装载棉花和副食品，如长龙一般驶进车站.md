Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th— A tense commercial transportation blitz unfolded today along Shanghai's water and land transportation lines connecting to various locations.

    Railway transportation lines undertook the main task of the blitz of transportation. The Zhenru Station's commercial special line, dedicated to shipping industrial products to the countryside, was exceptionally busy today with constant traffic. The four platforms, each over 170 meters long, were piled high with goods awaiting shipment like small mountains. Here, loading and unloading workers were on high alert, immediately attacking the loading of trains as soon as they arrived. From 6:00 PM yesterday to 6:00 PM today, this station loaded an average of one train car fully loaded with daily-use industrial products every twelve minutes, with a total shipment volume reaching over 3,000 tons, exceeding the usual rate by 1.8 times.

    On the Huangpu River, ships loaded with industrial products also sailed continuously. The "Peace No. 26" ship sailed to Zhejiang today, carrying over 400 tons of cotton cloth, underwear, cigarettes, and general merchandise. The fleet going up the Yangtze River transported over 500 tons of daily necessities and sundries to Jiangsu and other places.

    Agricultural and sideline products rushed out of areas closer to Shanghai have already partially arrived in Shanghai today. These goods are mainly non-staple foods urgently needed by the people of Shanghai, including live pigs, live cattle, poultry, and fresh eggs from Jiangsu and Anhui, and fresh vegetables, pickles, seafood, and Shaoxing wine from Zhejiang. Early this morning, a train carrying twenty-five train cars of cotton from Shandong, Shanxi, and Anhui, streamed into Shanghai's Jiangwan Station like a long dragon. Transportation trucks delivered part of the cotton to Shanghai's textile factories on the same day. More of the non-staple foods and industrial raw materials supporting Shanghai from various regions are still in transit.

    Shanghai, which undertakes approximately one-fourth of the national supply of daily-use industrial products, has prioritized supporting industrial products to various regions in this transportation blitz. Related commercial and transportation departments have made urgent arrangements in advance. Transportation trunk lines have freed up train cars and ships. Some public buses, taxis, and pedicabs in the city have also participated in transportation, concentrating goods from factories and warehouses to stations and docks. Shanghai's various industrial product purchasing and supply stations prepared their goods sources several days ago. Five large warehouses in the city shipped goods all night long. A large number of commercial department cadres, including managers, also went to the station to support loading and unloading. To support the people of various regions in meeting their winter needs, Shanghai has first dispatched winter-proof cotton clothing, wool underwear, cotton sweaters and pants, dark cotton cloth, and other commodities. For Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions where the climate warms up earlier, undershirts, vests, light-colored floral fabrics, and other summer wear for next year have also been shipped in advance.

    上海商业运输突击战第一日
    大批御寒用品发运各地，使人们暖暖和和过冬
    火车装载棉花和副食品，如长龙一般驶进车站
    新华社上海11日电  上海连接各地的水陆运输线上，今天展开了一场紧张的商业运输突击战。
    铁路运输线担负了突击调运的主要任务。专门发运下乡工业品的真如车站商业专用线上，今天车来车往，分外忙碌，四个各长一百七十多公尺的月台上，像小山一样地堆满了待运的商品。在这里，装卸工人严阵以待，火车一到就立刻突击装车。这个车站从昨日下午六时到今日下午六时的一昼夜间，平均每十二分钟装出一个满载日用工业品的火车车皮，总发货量达到三千多吨，超过平时的一点八倍。
    在黄浦江边，装运工业品的轮船也连续出航。和平二十六号轮今天驶往浙江，载去四百多吨棉布、内衣、卷烟和日用百货；逆长江而上的船队，给江苏等地运去了五百多吨日用品和杂货。
    离上海较近的地区突击运出的农副产品，今天已经有一部分运抵上海。这些商品，主要是上海人民急需的副食品。其中有江苏和安徽的生猪、活牛、家禽、鲜蛋，浙江的鲜菜、酱菜、海鱼和绍酒。今天凌晨，火车载着二十五个车皮的山东、山西、安徽的棉花，像一条长龙驶进了上海江湾车站，运输卡车当天就把部分棉花送进了上海的纺织工厂。各地支援上海的副食品和工业原料，更大量的还在运输途中。
    担负全国日用工业品供应任务约四分之一的上海，在这次突击运输中把支援各地工业品作为首要任务，有关的商业和交通运输部门事先都作了紧急部署。运输干线腾出了车船；市内一部分公共汽车、出租小汽车和三轮车也参加了运输，把商品从工厂、仓库集中到车站、码头；上海各个工业品采购供应站几天前就作好了货源准备；市内五个大型仓库通宵发货；大批商业部门干部包括经理在内，也到车站支援装卸。为了支援各地人民过冬的要求，上海这次首先调出御寒用的棉衣、绒衣裤、棉毛衫裤、深色棉布等商品；对广东、福建等气候转热较早的地区，还特地提前运出汗衫、背心、浅色花布等明年夏令穿着用品。（附图片）
