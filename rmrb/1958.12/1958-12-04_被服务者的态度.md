    The Attitude of the Served
    Cheng Ke
    Early in the morning, I encountered a dramatic quarrel: people were lining up to get on the bus, when a man who looked quite imposing rushed over, pushed people aside, and tried to board. He was stopped by someone maintaining order at the door. A quarrel ensued, and even as the bus started moving, the two were still arguing relentlessly. The man trying to get on the bus was particularly loud, repeatedly questioning, "What kind of service attitude is this?" but saying nothing else. The person criticized for having a "bad attitude" insisted, "Talk less about attitude, and more about reason." The quarrel seemed deadlocked, with no immediate resolution. Thankfully, the female conductor mediated, advising the passenger to "say less." Because this person was also a passenger, helping to maintain order on the bus voluntarily, and not a staff member. The anger of the man who was loudly criticizing the other’s service attitude suddenly subsided, and the quarrel ceased. I secretly admired the female conductor for being so skilled at resolving difficulties!
    However, a new thought immediately began to stir in my mind, and accompanied by the bus's bumps, it gradually unfolded.
    I think that the passenger initially made such a fuss because he mistook the other passenger for a staff member. That's why he didn't talk about reason but loudly accused the other of having a bad attitude. In his mind, at that moment, "You are the service provider, and I am the one being served, so reason is naturally on my side. If I am not satisfied, then naturally your attitude is bad." Once his conjectured identity of the other person changed, their relationship was no longer that of service provider and the served, and his set of "reasons" specifically used to deal with service personnel became useless. Consequently, jumping the line and forcibly scolding others became unreasonable, and knowing he was in the wrong, he naturally couldn't open his mouth.
    From this, I saw the remnants of hierarchical concepts lurking in the hearts of some people. When they are in the position of being served, they always feel superior, as if they are above the service personnel. They always like to put on an air of being able to summon service personnel at will. Even when they are shouting loudly themselves, they still say others have a bad attitude. It seems that the attitude of the served should naturally be one of frowning and scolding others, as if treating service personnel with a calm and peaceful attitude would damage their rights.
    Service personnel should have a good attitude, and people can ask service personnel to have a better attitude. This is something everyone understands, including the service personnel themselves. If it weren't for the consciousness of service personnel, how could the "Five Satisfactions" campaign in the service industry, the "Passenger's Car," "Customer's Home," and the attentive hospitality that once made many feel unworthy, have appeared out of thin air before people's eyes? But what should be the correct attitude of the served? Isn't it time for these people to reflect on themselves?
    The so-called attitude problem is actually a question of how to view the relationship between the served and the service provider. As long as there is a completely equal, comradely, and friendly relationship, the attitude will naturally improve. I believe that people should especially respect service personnel, because they are doing everything possible to serve people!

    被服务者的态度
    程克
    一清早就遇上了一次戏剧性的争吵：人们正在按次序上公共汽车，一个看来器宇轩昂的人急急奔来，拨开别人就要上车，被一个守在车门旁维持秩序的人拦住了。于是争吵发生了，一直到车开动了，两个人还在车上互不相让。声音特别高的是那个要上车的，只听他左一个“你这算什么服务态度”，右一个“你这算什么服务态度”地连连责问，却也不再听到他说出别的话来。那个被批评为“态度不好”的人，却坚持地要他：“少讲些态度，多讲些道理”。争吵看来是各执一端，一时难以获得圆满结果的。多亏了女售票员从中排解，她劝那位乘客“少说两句”。因为这一位也是乘客，自动帮助车上维持秩序的，并非车上的服务员。那位大声责问别人服务态度不好的人的怒火，突然地熄灭了，争吵也随之停止。我暗暗钦佩这位女售票员真是一个善于排难解纷的妙手！
    然而，一个新的思绪立即在我脑子里开始波动，伴随着车子的颠簸，它也渐渐延展开来。
    我想，那位乘客开初那样大吵，是把另一位乘客错当作服务员的。所以他就不讲道理而大声斥责别人态度不好。在他看来，这时，你是服务者，我是被服务者，所以道理自然就在我这边，我不满意了，自然就是你的态度不好。一旦他臆测的对方的身份变化了，他们之间的关系便不再是服务者与被服务者了，他的这套专门用以对付服务员的“道理”也就没有了用武之地，于是越次上车、强词斥人，都变成了无理，自知理亏，自然也就开口不得。
    由此，我看到了潜藏在一种人内心里的等级观念的残余。他们一处于被服务的地位时，总觉得是占了上风，比服务员高了一头似的。对于服务员总是喜欢摆出一副呼之即来挥之即去的神气，明明是自己高声大叫，还要说别人态度不好。好像被服务者的态度天生就应该是横眉竖目地呵斥别人，倘以平心静气的态度去对待服务员，就好像损伤了自己的权利似的。
    服务员的态度应该好，人们也可以要求服务员的态度好些，这是连服务员在内，全都明白了的。倘不是服务人员们的自觉，服务性行业内的五满意运动，到处都是的“乘客之车”、“顾客之家”，以及曾经使许多人感到受之有愧的那些殷勤的招待，怎会凭空地出现在人们眼前呢？但是被服务者的正确的态度应该是什么呢？岂不也应该是这种人反躬自问的时候了么？
    所谓态度问题，其实是怎样看待被服务者同服务者之间的关系的问题。只要有着一种完全平等的同志式的友爱关系，那态度自然也会好起来。我以为，人们应该特别地多尊重一些服务员，因为他们是在千方百计地为人们服务的呀！
