    Guangzhou Builds Plastics Factory
    Uses Alcohol to Produce "King of Plastics" - Polyethylene
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 28th. The newly built Guangzhou Plastics Factory officially started production on the 26th. This is a factory with an experimental nature, and it will use the low-pressure method for production, which is a new method that has only recently begun to be used in the world. The main task of this factory next year is to produce polyethylene. It will continue to be expanded into a large-scale plastics factory in the future.
    Polyethylene is known as the "King of Plastics." It has very strong toughness and has various properties such as acid resistance, alkali resistance, heat resistance, cold resistance, and insulation. It has a wide range of uses.
    The Guangzhou Plastics Factory uses alcohol as a raw material. Guangdong Province is one of the provinces with more sugar production in the country, and the by-product of sugar production is a large amount of alcohol. Three tons of alcohol can be made into one ton of polyethylene. Therefore, Guangdong Province has great prospects for developing the plastics industry.

    广州建成塑料厂
    用酒精制“塑料之王”——聚乙烯
    新华社广州28日电  新建广州塑料厂在26日正式开工生产。这是一个带有试验性质的工厂，它将采用低压法进行生产，这是世界上近年来才开始使用的一种新方法。这个工厂明年主要的任务是生产聚乙烯。以后还将继续扩建为大型塑料厂。
    聚乙烯被称为“塑料之王”。它具有很强的坚韧性，有耐酸、耐碱、耐热、耐寒、绝缘等多种性能，用途很广。
    广州塑料厂是采用酒精来作原料的。广东省是全国产糖较多的省份之一，制糖所得的副产品便是大量的酒精，三吨酒精可制成一吨聚乙烯。因此，广东省发展塑料工业大有前途。
