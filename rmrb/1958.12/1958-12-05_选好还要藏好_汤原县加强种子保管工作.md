Tangyuan County Strengthens Seed Storage Work

(According to Heilongjiang Daily) In order to ensure the realization of the leap forward targets for agricultural production next year, Tangyuan County, while combining autumn harvest and deep plowing of cultivated land, has carried out seed selection and seed storage work.

Earlier, the Tangyuan County Party Committee, based on the county's planned sowing area for 1959 and the need to implement close planting, determined the seed work tasks for this year. It is estimated that the county needs to select and retain 27,199 tons of various crop seeds for next year. The selection and retention of these seeds should be done by selecting individual plants and selecting ears of grain, selecting pure strains and selecting sufficient quantities, and using appropriate methods to store them properly.

In order to achieve this plan, the County Party Committee held an on-site meeting on good seed selection and cellar storage work at the Hongqi Work Area of the Tangwang Korean People's Commune as early as October 10, and then held five telephone conferences to make specific arrangements for seed work. During the on-site meeting, it was discovered that some cadres and the masses believed that it was not good to keep too many seeds because they were difficult to select and store; some people were afraid that they would not be able to store them well this year because they had not stored them well in the past, and so on. The on-site meeting conducted debates on these ideas, and introduced typical experiences and visited the practices of cellar seed storage in the debates, thus solving ideological problems in this regard. After the meeting, the people's communes also arranged seed work, and seed selection work was carried out throughout the county. Some people's communes also organized seed work inspection teams. The Qinshan Work Area of the Heli People's Commune mobilized more than 270 women and male commune members at one time, and spent one night and one and a half days digging 18 cellars to store the seeds. A total of more than 13,000 people were mobilized in the county to carry out seed selection and cellar storage.

Through the above work, by November 16, the county had selected 15,993 tons of various crop seeds needed for next year, accounting for 58.7% of the planned seed selection, with a purity of over 86%, and dug 119 seed cellars. Rice seeds are stored in cellars, and corn seeds are distributed and stored by commune members.

    选好还要藏好
    汤原县加强种子保管工作
    据黑龙江日报消息  汤原县为了保证实现明年农业生产跃进指标，在结合秋收和耕地深翻等工作的同时，开展了选种和种子贮备保管工作。
    中共汤原县委在早些时候，根据全县1959年的计划播种面积和实行密植的需要，确定了今年的种子工作任务。预计全县要为明年选留各种作物种子二万七千一百九十九吨。对这些种子的选留要采取棵选、穗选办法，选纯、选足，并采用适当办法保管好。
    为了实现这个计划，县委早在10月10日就在汤旺朝鲜族人民公社红旗作业区召开了良种选留和窖藏工作现场会议，随之又召开了五次电话会议，对种子工作作了具体部署。在现场会议中，发现了部分干部和群众认为多留种子不好选、不好保管；有的人因为过去没保管好，害怕今年还保管不好，等等。现场会议中针对这些思想开展了辩论，并在辩论中介绍了典型经验，参观了窖藏种子的做法，从而解决了这一方面的思想问题。会议开过之后，各人民公社也安排了种子工作，选种工作在全县开展起来。有的人民公社还组织了种子工作检查团。鹤立人民公社亲善作业区一次就出动二百七十多名妇女和男社员，利用一宿和一天半的时间挖了十八个窖，把种子贮藏起来。全县共出动一万三千多人进行选种和挖窖贮种等工作。
    经过上述工作，全县明年所需要的各种作物种子到11月16日已选出一万五千九百九十三吨，占计划选种数的58.7％，纯度达86％以上，挖种子窖一百一十九个。水稻种子入窖保管，苞米种子已分散由社员保管。
