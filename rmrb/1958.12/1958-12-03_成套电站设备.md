    Complete Power Station Equipment
    Power stations are classified according to the source of power into thermal power, hydropower, wind power, tidal power, animal power, etc., with thermal power and hydropower stations as the backbone. Generally speaking, complete power station equipment refers to thermal power and hydropower station equipment.
    Complete power station equipment is based on power generation equipment. The main engine of thermal power generation equipment consists of boilers, steam turbines and generators. In addition to the main engine, there are also water, steam, fuel processing, transmission, and control systems, requiring a series of auxiliary equipment such as various water pumps, blowers, coal crushers, coal feeders, thermal control instruments, and valves. The main engine of hydropower generation equipment consists of hydraulic turbines and hydro generators. In addition to the two main engines, there are also water inlet and outlet systems and speed and voltage adjustment control systems, requiring a series of auxiliary equipment such as various governors, hydraulic devices, butterfly valves, automation components, and voltage adjustment devices.
    After the power generation equipment generates electricity, in order to supply electricity economically, safely, and reliably to various sectors of the national economy, a series of transmission, distribution, control, and protection electrical equipment are also required, including various high and low voltage control panels, transformers, motors, mutual inductors, circuit breakers, isolating switches, electrical instruments, wires and cables, high and low voltage electrical porcelain, and a series of supporting products.
    The above auxiliary equipment and supporting products are organized into complete sets with the main engine in a certain proportion, and are collectively referred to as complete power station equipment.

    成套电站设备
    电站按动力来源分为火力、水力、风力、潮汐、畜力等电站，其中以火力和水力电站为骨干。一般说成套电站设备，就是指火力和水力电站设备。
    成套电站设备以发电设备为主体。火力发电设备的主机由锅炉、主机外，还有水、汽、燃料的处理、传递和控制系统，需要各种水泵、鼓风机、碎煤机、给煤机、热工控制仪表和阀门等一系列辅助设备。水力发电设备的主机由水轮机和水轮发电机组成。除二大主机外，还有进出水系统和速度与电压调整控制系统，需要各种调速器、油压装置、蝴蝶阀、自动化元件，以及电压调整装置等一系列辅助设备。
    在发电设备发出电以后，要使电能经济、安全、可靠地供应国民经济各个部门使用，还需要一系列输配电和控制保护等电气设备，需要各种高低压控制屏、变压器、电动机、互感器、断路器、隔离开关、电气仪表、电线电缆、高低压电瓷等一系列配套产品。
    以上辅助设备和配套产品，都和主机按一定的比例组织成套，总称为成套电站设备。
