    Mobilize Commune Members to Improve Distribution
    Jiangnan Commune Correctly Handles the Relationship Between Accumulation and Consumption

    (Our dispatch) The Jiangnan People's Commune in Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, implemented the Party's mass line in this year's income distribution work, with good results, taking into account the interests of the state, the commune, and the members.

    The Jiangnan People's Commune reaped an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with a total annual income of 2,710,000 yuan, an increase of 146% over last year; the total grain output reached 37,339,500 jin, an increase of 156% over last year; the entire commune had 3,081 households and 13,190 people, with an average of 2,830 jin of grain per person. The commune extensively mobilized the masses and, after more than 40 days of repeated debate and research, determined, based on this year's income, next year's production needs, and the local people's living standards, to use 433,600 yuan to pay various taxes and repay state loans, accounting for 16% of the total income; to use 1,300,800 yuan for commune production costs, management fees, reserve funds, and various construction funds, accounting for 48% of the total income, an increase of 115.7% over last year; and to use 975,600 yuan for member distribution, accounting for 36% of the total income, with an average income of 73.90 yuan per person, an increase of 52% over last year. This not only ensured the capital needs for the commune's greater leap forward in production next year but also ensured that more than 90% of the members increased their income, and the remaining 10% of households (excluding those undergoing labor reform and other households with labor outflow) were basically no lower than last year's income.

    How did the Jiangnan People's Commune implement the mass line in the distribution work?

    First, it cleared the accounts, ascertained the thinking, and handed over the "accounts" of this year's income to the masses for discussion. The commune, led by the secretary, organized the secretaries and directors of each cultivation area and financial personnel to clear the accounts for the year, estimated the output, and settled the total income for the year; at the same time, it also calculated the total income of last year, the ratio of distribution to accumulation, and the average income of the members, so as to compare with this year's and study this year's distribution plan. At the same time, the commune leaders understood the thinking of the cadres and members and classified them. From the classification, it could be seen that on the issue of distribution and accumulation, most Party members, League members, and cadres had the idea of accumulating more and distributing less, saying, "If we are working hard, we must overcome even if life is a bit difficult"; the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, especially those in debt, advocated "production should leap forward, and the lives of the members should also be taken care of"; some well-to-do middle peasants with serious bourgeois ideas strongly advocated "two mores, one less, and one ruthless," that is: distribute more, repay more member savings, accumulate less, and ruthlessly deduct member debts. In light of this situation, the commune adopted the method of summarizing the achievements of a year of hard work, announced the figures of this year's income and output to the masses, so that each member knew exactly how much income was earned this year, and mobilized them to further deliberate and discuss the distribution issue.

    Second, thoroughly debate and understand. During the debate, the masses adopted methods such as calculating accounts, comparing, presenting conditions, reasoning, recalling the past, and envisioning the future, realizing that correctly arranging distribution and accumulation has five major benefits: first, it guarantees the capital needs for a greater leap forward in production next year, that is, it guarantees the early realization of the happy days of the people of the entire commune; second, it guarantees the improvement of the members' lives and encourages the enthusiasm of the masses; third, it can cultivate the socialist and communist ideas of the members, making the members more patriotic, loving of the commune, and loving of the collective; fourth, it is conducive to overcoming the selfish and capitalist ideas of the members; fifth, it can avoid extravagance and waste. Thus, the differences in distribution principles were resolved, and the correct ratio of accumulation and distribution was formulated, ensuring that more than 90% of the members increased their income.

    Third, debate while deciding, and implement step by step. This makes it easy to boost the morale of the masses, and easy to further study and resolve the next issue. When determining each approach, the leadership conducted repeated investigations and research, trying to find a way that conformed to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical. When a method was generally determined, it was immediately announced to the public, and the opinions of the masses were solicited again, supplemented, and revised until the masses were satisfied. For example, the handling of debt issues, after repeated five discussions and revisions, finally decided to adopt different methods of "repaying, deferring, reducing, and exempting" according to different situations. Once a decision was made, it was immediately implemented, and the masses were very satisfied.

    At the end of the distribution work, the Jiangnan People's Commune vigorously publicized the commune's production plan and organized an exhibition, so that the members saw the bright future of the commune, and people were clearer about the purpose and significance of production, they said: "Let's work hard, good days are still ahead."

    发动社员搞好分配   
    江南公社正确处理积累和消费关系
    本报讯  黑龙江省宁安县江南人民公社今年的收益分配工作贯彻了党的群众路线，效果很好，使国家、公社和社员三方面的利益都得到了照顾。
    江南人民公社今年获得了空前大丰收，全年总收入二百七十一万元，比去年增加146％；粮食总产量达三千七百三十三万九千五百余斤，比去年增加156％；全社三千零八十一户，一万三千一百九十人，平均每人有粮食二千八百三十斤。公社广泛发动群众，经过四十余天的反复辩论、研究，根据今年的收入，明年的生产需要和当地人民生活水平等情况，确定以四十三万三千六百元作为上缴各种税款和偿还国家贷款，占总收入的16％；以一百三十万零八百元作为公社生产费、管理费、储备金和各种建设资金，占总收入的48％，比去年增加115.7％；以九十七万五千六百元作为社员分配部分，占总收入的36％，平均每人收入七十三元九角，比去年增加52％。这样，既保证了公社明年生产更大跃进的资金需要，同时也保证了90％以上的社员增加了收入，其余10％的户（除掉劳改分子及其它劳力外流户）基本上也不低于去年收入。
    江南人民公社在分配工作中是怎样贯彻群众路线的？
    一是算清账目，摸清思想，把今年收入的“账”交给群众进行讨论。公社由书记挂帅，组织各耕作区书记、主任和财务人员清理了一年来的账目，估清了产量，结算出今年的总收入；同时，还算清了去年的总收入、分配与积累的比例及社员的平均收入情况，以便同今年的进行比较，研究今年的分配方案。同时公社领导了解了干部和社员的思想情况，并进行了分类排队。从排队中可以看出，在分配与积累问题上，大多数党团员和干部存在着多积累少分配的思想，他们说：“苦战嘛，生活困难点也要克服”；广大贫农和下中农，特别是欠债户，主张“生产要跃进，社员生活也要照顾”；有些资产阶级思想严重的富裕中农，则极力主张“两多一少一狠”，即：多分，多还社员存款，少积累，狠扣社员的欠款。根据这种情况，公社采取了总结苦战一年成果的方式，把今年的收入、产量数字向群众公布，让每个社员都知道今年到底收入了多少，动员他们对分配问题作进一步酝酿讨论。
    二是辩透想通。在辩论过程中，群众采取了算账、对比、摆条件、讲道理、回忆过去、设想未来等等方法，认识到正确安排分配与积累有五大好处：一、保证了明年生产更大跃进的资金需要，也就是保证了全公社人民的幸福日子早日实现；二、保证了社员生活的改善，鼓舞了群众的干劲；三、能培养社员的社会主义、共产主义思想，使社员更加爱国爱社爱集体；四、有利于克服社员的自私自利资本主义思想；五、能避免挥霍浪费。从而解决了在分配原则上的分歧，制定了积累与分配的正确比例，保证90％以上的社员都增加了收入。
    三是边辩边定、步步落实。这样做，既便于鼓舞群众情绪，又便于进一步研究和解决下一个问题。领导上在确定每个做法的时候，都作了反复的调查研究，设法找出一条符合多快好省精神的办法。当一种方法大体上确定之后，立即当众宣布，再次征求群众的意见，补充修改，直到群众满意。例如对债务问题的处理，经过反复五次讨论和修改，最后决定了根据不同情况，采取“还、缓、减、免”的不同办法。既经决定，立即实行，群众十分满意。
    江南人民公社在分配工作结尾时，大力宣传了公社生产规划，组织了展览会，使社员看到了公社的美好的未来，人们对生产的目的与意义也更清楚了，他们说：“猛劲干吧，好日子还在后头呢。”
