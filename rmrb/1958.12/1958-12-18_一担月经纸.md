    A Load of Sanitary Pads
    By our reporter Zhang Zhisheng
    On November 11th, a cold day, on a rugged mountain path leading to the Heping Commune Mao Ping Iron Factory in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, a young man was carrying a load of grass paper, heading towards the iron factory. He came closer and closer. The workers then clearly saw that it was Comrade Cao Fangbing, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee.
    Many people wondered, what was he bringing a load of grass paper for? It turned out that a few days earlier, when Deputy Secretary Cao went to the iron factory, he discovered a problem that had not been noticed but needed to be solved. That day, after visiting many workers, he went to see a sick female worker – activist Zeng Xiunv. He carefully applied medicine to her injured foot like a caring older brother, while asking the women nearby if they had any difficulties in their lives. The women usually knew that Deputy Secretary Cao was very caring, and they felt comfortable talking to him. At that time, Cao Xiuju, the head of the women's group, who was washing clothes, quietly told him: "We are doing well in everything, but the living conditions are still a bit poor. There is no place to buy needles and thread, especially for us women, we are afraid when our periods come, and it's hard to talk about it. Some are so anxious they want to cry." Cao Fangbing kept this matter firmly in mind. A few days later, he personally delivered a load of grass paper. Xu Xicui, the head of the women's group, said with emotion: "The Party really cares about us too much. It would be a real disservice to the Party if we didn't produce well."
    Caring for the lives of the masses is not the only thing that Comrade Cao Fangbing does. Since the Commune Party Committee appointed him to be responsible for managing the welfare of the commune members, the daily difficulties of the masses are constantly on his mind. He understands the specific difficulties of the masses very well because he lost his parents at a young age and lived a life of utter poverty. Today, the broad masses of commune members have such enthusiasm for building socialism, and so many people's lives need to be cared for. If a Party cadre doesn't care about them, who will? Therefore, every time he goes to a place, he asks about the living conditions of the masses.
    Once, also at the Mao Ping Iron Factory. He heard that Communist Youth League member Jiang Fusheng had been demoted from platoon leader to squad leader. It was said that the factory didn't even want him to be a squad leader anymore. The factory's opinion was: he is not active and likes to be lazy. Old Cao thought silently: Strange, wasn't he a very active person? How could he have changed so quickly? Later, after learning the details, it turned out that this was the reason: Jiang Fusheng's family was poor, with a large family size. In the past few years, there had been severe droughts, and his income was low, so he could only afford to eat and not to dress. When the weather turned cold, he didn't even have a pair of long pants. He was responsible for transporting raw materials and fuel for the iron factory, and he had to work at night. His shorts could not withstand the piercing cold wind, but he was too embarrassed to ask for a subsidy, so he had no choice but to not work. The factory leaders didn't understand the situation and thought he was lazy, so they demoted him. Cao Fangbing immediately discussed this with the factory leaders, pointing out that the mistake was not with Jiang Fusheng, but with our cadres who had not cared about the lives of the masses. He immediately bought cloth and found a worker at the sewing factory, who made new clothes and gave them to Jiang Fusheng within an hour. Jiang Fusheng shed tears of excitement and gratitude while putting on the clothes. He said to his companions with emotion: "My father and mother are dear, but the Party is even dearer." From then on, his enthusiasm soared, and he was one of the fastest and best at completing tasks. Inspired by this incident, he further learned that some people were short of cotton clothes, so he reported this situation to the Commune Party Committee. After discussion, the Commune Party Committee decided to draw nearly 20,000 yuan from diversified business income and temporarily lend it to commune members with difficult living conditions to buy cotton clothes. The entire commune gathered cotton ginners and sewing workers, and rushed to make 305 cotton quilts, 550 cotton clothes, 280 bed sheets and quilts, and more than 2,000 single clothes, which were distributed in a timely manner after extensive discussion and evaluation by the commune members. Chen Wu, a member of the Third Company of the First Battalion, still had a tattered cotton wadding passed down from his mother, and the couple were often freezing. This time, he got a new cotton quilt and jumped up with joy.

    一担月经纸
    本报记者  张芷生
    11月11日，天气寒冷，在去湖南省永兴县和平公社毛平铁厂的一条崎岖的山道上，一个年轻的男子挑着一担草纸，往铁厂方向走来。来的人越走越近。工人们这才看清楚原来是公社党委副书记曹芳炳同志。
    许多人奇怪，他挑担草纸来做什么呢？原来在几天以前，曹副书记到铁厂的时候，发现一个没有被人注意但又必须解决的问题。那一天，他探望很多工人之后，又去看一个得病的女工——积极分子曾秀女，他一边细心地像亲哥哥一样帮她在受伤的脚上搽药，一边询问旁边的妇女，生活上还有些什么困难。妇女们平时就知道曹副书记非常关心人，她们和他谈话也毫无拘束。当时，正在洗衣的妇女组长曹秀菊就细声细气地告诉他：“我们样样都好，就是生活条件还差了一点，没有地方买针线，特别是我们妇女，连纸也没有，来了月经就害怕，又不好开口，有的急得要哭。”曹芳炳把这件事紧记在心。过了几天，他就亲自送来一担草纸。妇女组长许细翠感动地说：“党真的太关心我们了，再不好好生产真是对不起党。”
    曹芳炳同志关心群众生活并不只是这一件事。自公社党委确定他负责管理社员生活福利事业以后，群众的日常生活有什么困难，就时时刻刻都在他脑子里打圈子。他很理解群众的具体困难，因为他从小就失去父母，过着一贫如洗的生活。今天广大社员这种建设社会主义的干劲，这样多人的生活，作为党的一个干部不去关心他们，谁管呢？因此，他每到一个地方，就要问及群众生活情况。
    有一次，也是在毛平铁厂。他听到共青团员蒋福生由排长撤职当班长，据说班长也不打算要他当了。厂里意见是：他不积极，爱躲懒。老曹默默地想：奇怪，不是一个很积极的人吗？怎么变得这么快？后来一了解，原来是这么回事：蒋福生家底薄，家中人口多，过去几年旱灾重，收入不多，因此顾了吃就顾不了穿，天冷了，还没有一条长裤子。他负责铁厂原料、燃料的运输工作，夜晚出工，短裤抵挡不住刺肉的寒风，请求补助又不好开得口，只好不出工。厂里领导不了解情况，就认为他懒，将他撤了职。曹芳炳当时就找着厂里领导研究，指出错误不在蒋福生，而在于我们干部没有关心群众的生活。他自己连忙去买了布，找着缝纫厂的工人，一点钟内就把新衣做好送给了蒋福生。蒋福生一边穿衣，一边掉下了兴奋感激的眼泪，他对同伴感动地说：“爹亲，娘亲，不如党亲。”从此以后，他干劲冲天，是完成任务最快最好数他一个。在这件事情启发下，他进一步了解还有一些群众缺棉衣，他就向公社党委汇报这个情况。公社党委研究后，决定从多种经营收入中，抽出将近两万多元，暂借给生活困难的社员添置棉衣。全社集中了弹花工人和缝纫工人，突击制了三百零五床棉被，五百五十件棉衣，二百八十床单被，二千多件单衣，经过社员广泛讨论、评议及时地发放下去了。一营三连社员陈戊已，还是母亲手里传下来的一床破棉絮，两口子经常冷得无法。这回他得到了一床新棉被后，高兴地跳起来。
