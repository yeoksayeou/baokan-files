A Note

    Words of the Alarmed

    U.S. Under Secretary of State Herter said in a recent speech that the United States should not "panic" over the economic progress made by China and the Soviet Union.

    West German Chancellor Adenauer personally went to West Berlin to advise West Berlin residents not to "panic" over the Soviet proposal for the demilitarization of West Berlin.

    Who is panicking? The American people have no reason to panic about the economic achievements of China and the Soviet Union. West Berlin residents are only too happy to welcome the Soviet Union's peace proposals, so what is there to panic about? It is none other than the U.S. Under Secretary of State and the West German Chancellor themselves who are panicking. We would like to advise these two gentlemen that there is no need to panic, and that panicking will not help.

### 惊慌者言

    惊慌者言
    美国副国务卿赫脱在最近一次演说中说：美国不要对中苏在经济上取得的进展“惊慌”。
    西德总理阿登纳亲自到西柏林，劝西柏林居民不要对苏联关于西柏林非军事化的建议“惊慌”。
    谁惊慌呢？美国人民对于中苏的经济成就是没有理由惊慌的，西柏林居民对苏联的和平建议欢迎犹恐不及，惊慌什么。惊慌的不是别人，正是美国副国务卿和西德总理自己。我们倒要劝这两位先生用不着惊慌，而且惊慌是无济于事的。
