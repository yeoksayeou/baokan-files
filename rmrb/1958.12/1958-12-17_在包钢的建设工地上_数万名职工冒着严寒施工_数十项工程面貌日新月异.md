Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, December 16th (Reporter Lin Tian): Under the leadership of the CPC Baotou Municipal Committee and the Baotou Steel Party Committee, the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise is carrying out a mass movement and a technical revolution, resulting in rapid progress. Currently, tens of thousands of employees are braving the severe cold of the frontier to carry out winter construction day and night on dozens of projects in the six key systems of iron smelting, steelmaking, coking, refractory materials, mining, and cement. The appearance of the construction site is also changing day by day.

At the iron smelting plant construction site, the main body of the first large-scale automated blast furnace and the hot blast stove have risen high into the sky. Currently, employees are welding the last circle of the furnace body shell and the top cap of the hot blast stove.

The huge steelmaking plant project has also started construction half a year ahead of schedule. The first large open-hearth furnace being built in this plant is comparable in size to the "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces" at Anshan Iron and Steel. The foundation of the open-hearth furnace has already been poured, and part of the foundation of the first large mixer furnace has also been poured. Employees at the plant have successfully adopted a new concrete engineering technology—pressure grouting—in the foundation project, thereby greatly speeding up the project's progress.

Next to the iron smelting plant and the steelmaking plant, tall coal storage towers and ten large coal blending tanks can be seen from afar. This is the coking plant construction site. The first large coke oven with an annual output of 500,000 tons has been built and will be heated up in the coming days. Currently, workers are rushing to install machinery and repair projects related to coal preparation, recovery, and other systems related to coke production.

In order to supply a large amount of refractory materials for iron smelting and steelmaking, the construction of a refractory materials plant with an annual output of 150,000 tons has also entered the most intense stage. Two large round kilns for firing refractory bricks are already in trial production.

At the water source for production water, more than 5,000 people are fighting against ice mud and underground quicksand. Some of the technologically complex water intake structures and large-scale projects such as channels, pools, and pipelines have also been completed.

The Baiyun Obo Iron Mine, which provides iron ore for Baotou Steel, currently has more than 8,000 employees working in climates of minus 10 to minus 20 degrees Celsius. The roadbed for the electric locomotive railway leading to the top of the main mine has been completed, and electric locomotives will be driven to the top of the mountain around the end of the year. The primary iron ore crushing plant being built at the foot of the mountain has now entered a tense construction stage.

In addition, the general machinery repair plant, including six workshops, which was put into production successively in the first half of this year, has begun to manufacture some equipment for Baotou Steel. (Attached picture)

    在包钢的建设工地上
    数万名职工冒着严寒施工
    数十项工程面貌日新月异
    新华社包头16日电  记者林田报道：兴建中的包头钢铁联合企业，正在中共包头市委和包钢党委的领导下，大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命，建设工程突飞猛进。目前有数万名职工冒着塞外严寒，在炼铁、炼钢、焦化、耐火材料、矿山和水泥等六大重点系统的数十项工程上，日夜不停地进行冬季施工。工地的面貌也一天天在变化着。
    在炼铁厂工地，第一号大型自动化高炉本体和热风炉已经耸入高空，目前职工们正在焊接高炉最后一圈炉体外壳和热风炉顶帽。
    规模巨大的炼钢厂工程，也提前半年开始施工了。这个厂兴建中的第一座大型平炉，其规模同鞍钢“平炉之王”相当，目下已经浇灌好平炉基础；第一座大混铁炉的部分基础，也浇灌好了。职工们在这个厂的基础工程中，成功地采用了混凝土工程新技术——压力灌浆法，从而大大加快了工程进度。
    在炼铁厂和炼钢厂的旁边，远远就可以看到高大的贮煤塔和十座大配煤罐，这里是焦化厂工地。这个厂的第一座年产五十万吨的大焦炉已经修好，近日内就要烘炉。目前，工人们正在突击安装机械和起修同出焦有关的备煤、回收等系统的工程。
    为了供应炼铁、炼钢以大量耐火材料，一座年产十五万吨的耐火材料厂的建筑工程也进入最紧张的阶段。有两座烧制耐火砖的大圆窑，已经在试生产。
    生产用水的水源地上，有五千多人在同冰泥和地下流沙奋战。技术复杂的取水构筑物和工程量很大的渠道、水池、管线等工程，有一部分也做好了。
    为包钢提供铁矿石的白云鄂博铁矿山，现在有八千多名职工正在零下十度到二十多度的气候下施工。通往主矿山顶的电气机车铁路路基已经修好，年底前后，电气机车就要开到山顶。在山下边兴建的铁矿石初破碎厂，目前已经进入施工的紧张阶段。
    此外，今年上半年陆续投入生产的包括六个车间的机修总厂，已经开始为包钢制造部分设备。（附图片）
