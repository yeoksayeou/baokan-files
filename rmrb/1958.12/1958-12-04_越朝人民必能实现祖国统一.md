The recent visit of the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the friendly talks held with the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The successful conclusion of the Vietnam-Korea talks has further strengthened the unity of the Vietnamese and Korean people and the entire socialist camp, making new and important contributions to the cause of world peace.

The Vietnamese and Korean people are both peace-loving people. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea both pursue a peaceful foreign policy and have made unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace. In this meeting, the two countries exchanged views on current international issues and reached a consensus, once again expressing the peaceful aspirations of the Vietnamese and Korean people. The Vietnam-Korea Joint Communiqué pointed out in analyzing the current international situation that, due to the continuous growth of socialist forces and nationalist forces, the imperialist camp headed by the United States is increasingly weakening, and the socialist forces and peaceful forces are now completely stronger than the bellicose imperialist forces. The two countries reiterated their support for the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America for national independence, and support for our people's struggle to liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands; welcomed the Soviet Union's proposal to make West Berlin a free city, and supported the German Democratic Republic's initiative for a peaceful settlement of the German question; advocated the abolition of all military alliances and military bases, and demanded that all countries completely withdraw their troops stationed on the territory of other countries, and establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe and Asia. All of these are in the interests of the people of all countries in the world and are of great significance for easing international tensions.

Achieving the reunification of the motherland is the most ardent desire of the Vietnamese and Korean people. The joint communiqué pointed out that the reunification of Vietnam and the reunification of Korea must and will be achieved; the Vietnamese and Korean people will in the future more fully support each other in the struggle for the early realization of national reunification.

As everyone knows, due to the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism, the people of Vietnam and Korea have long been in the pain of artificially dividing their motherland. This is intolerable to the Vietnamese and Korean people, and it is also intolerable to all peace-loving people in the world.

After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and earnestly implemented the various provisions of the Geneva Accords, and has repeatedly proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultations to discuss general elections, and has made unremitting efforts to restore normal relations between the North and South and national reunification. However, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly violated the Geneva Accords, constantly shipped arms into South Vietnam, and stepped up the construction of military bases in South Vietnam, attempting to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony. Due to the interference and obstruction of U.S. imperialism, Vietnam's general election failed to be held as scheduled, and the country's reunification failed to be realized at an early date. On March 7th of this year, Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to the South Vietnamese authorities, firmly opposing U.S. imperialism's interference in South Vietnam, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam, stopping the establishment of military bases in South Vietnam, opposing dragging South Vietnam into military blocs, and suggesting that the North and South negotiate on disarmament and the restoration of trade relations between the North and South. This initiative was also rejected by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The situation in Korea is also the same. The Korean-Chinese side strictly abides by the Korean Armistice Agreement. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made a series of major efforts to achieve national reunification at an early date. However, U.S. imperialism is increasingly seriously violating the armistice agreement, even illegally shipping atomic weapons into South Korea and establishing missile bases in South Korea. On February 5th of this year, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement proposing that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, hold free elections throughout Korea, and negotiate between the North and South on economic, cultural and all-Korean elections and other issues. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have all withdrawn from Korea, but the troops of U.S. imperialism and its vassal states are still clinging to South Korea. This is the main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The Vietnam-Korea Joint Communiqué pointed out that Vietnam and Korea firmly demand that U.S. imperialism immediately stop interfering in South Vietnam, and firmly believe that U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible. This is the just call of the Vietnamese and Korean people, and it is also the common demand of all fair-minded public opinion.

The Chinese people sincerely thank the Vietnamese and Korean people for their active support for our struggle to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. At the same time, the Chinese people also warmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese and Korean people to achieve national reunification. We firmly believe that, just as the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands, the Vietnamese and Korean people's desire for national reunification will surely be realized. And U.S. imperialism, by occupying Taiwan and South Korea, and establishing military bases in South Vietnam, is putting three nooses around its own neck, and the longer they stay in these places, the tighter the people of Vietnam, Korea and China will pull these nooses!

During this meeting, the leaders of Vietnam and Korea also discussed the issue of further consolidating and developing friendly cooperation between the two countries. During the talks, the two sides also held negotiations on promoting trade relations between the two countries, and signed a barter and payment agreement between the two countries for the years 1959-1960. The further development of the fraternal cooperative relations between Vietnam and Korea will greatly enhance the strength of the socialist camp and the strength of world peace.

We warmly congratulate the successful visit of the Korean government delegation headed by Premier Kim Il-sung to Vietnam and the successful conclusion of the Vietnam-Korea talks, and congratulate the further strengthening of the unity between Vietnam and Korea and the growing consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

### 越朝人民必能实现祖国统一

    越朝人民必能实现祖国统一
    以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团最近访问了越南民主共和国，同越南民主共和国政府代表团进行了友好会谈。越朝会谈的圆满成功，进一步加强了越朝两国人民的团结和整个社会主义阵营的团结，对世界和平事业作出了新的重要贡献。
    越南人民和朝鲜人民都是爱好和平的人民。越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国都奉行着和平外交政策，为维护世界和平进行了不懈的努力。在这次会谈中，两国对当前国际问题交换了意见，并且取得了一致的看法，再一次表达了越朝两国人民的和平愿望。越朝会谈公报在分析当前国际形势时指出：由于社会主义力量和民族主义力量的不断壮大，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营日益衰弱，目前社会主义力量和和平力量完全比好战的帝国主义力量强大。两国重申支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，支持我国人民解放自己神圣领土台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争；欢迎苏联关于西柏林成为自由城市的建议，并且支持民主德国关于和平解决德国问题的倡议；主张废除各军事联盟和军事基地，要求各国把驻在他国领土上的军队完全撤出，在欧亚两洲设立无核子武器地区。所有这些都是符合世界各国人民的利益的，对缓和国际紧张局势具有重大的意义。
    实现祖国的统一，是越南人民和朝鲜人民最殷切的愿望。两国会谈公报指出：越南的统一和朝鲜的统一必须实现，而且也一定能够实现；越朝两国人民今后在为早日实现祖国统一的斗争中更加全力互相支持。
    大家知道，由于美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，越南和朝鲜两国人民，都长期陷入祖国被人为地分裂的痛苦中。这是越朝两国人民所不能容忍的，也是全世界爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。
    印度支那和平恢复后，越南民主共和国一贯认真执行日内瓦协议的各项规定，一再向越南南方当局提出举行协商讨论普选的建议，为恢复南北之间的正常关系和国家统一作了不懈的努力。然而美帝国主义却一再破坏日内瓦协议，不断向越南南方运入军火，加紧在越南南方修建军事基地，企图把越南南方拉入东南亚侵略集团，把越南南方变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。由于美帝国主义的干涉和阻挠，越南的普选未能如期举行，国家的统一未能早日实现。今年3月7日，越南民主共和国总理范文同写信给越南南方当局，坚决反对美帝国主义对南越的干涉，要求美国军事人员撤出越南南方，停止在越南南方建立军事基地，反对把越南南方拉入军事集团，并且建议南北双方协商讨论裁军和恢复南北之间贸易关系问题。这项倡议也遭到了美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的拒绝。朝鲜的情况也是一样。朝中方面严格遵守朝鲜停战协定。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为早日实现国家统一曾作了一系列的重大努力。然而美帝国主义却越来越严重地破坏停战协定，甚至非法向南朝鲜运入原子武器，并且在南朝鲜建立导弹基地。今年2月5日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明，建议一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，举行全朝鲜的自由选举，南北双方协商讨论南北之间的经济、文化和全朝鲜选举等问题。现在，中国人民志愿军已经全部从朝鲜撤出，然而美帝国主义及其仆从国家的军队却仍然赖在南朝鲜不走。这是和平解决朝鲜问题的主要障碍。越朝联合公报指出：越朝两国坚决要求美帝国主义立即停止对越南南方的干涉，坚决认为美军必须及早撤出南朝鲜。这是越朝两国人民的正义呼声，也是所有公正舆论的共同要求。
    中国人民衷心感谢越南人民和朝鲜人民对我们解放自己神圣领土台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争所给予的积极支持。同时，中国人民也热烈支持越南人民和朝鲜人民为实现祖国统一而进行的正义斗争。我们坚决相信：同中国人民一定要解放台湾和沿海岛屿一样，越朝两国人民争取祖国统一的愿望也一定能够实现。而美帝国主义霸占台湾和南朝鲜，在越南南方建立军事基地，把三条绞索套在自己的脖子上，他们在这些地方停留越久，越朝中三国人民也就会把这些绞索越拉越紧！
    这次会谈中，越朝两国领导人还讨论了进一步巩固和发展两国之间的友好合作问题。会谈期间，双方还就促进两国贸易关系问题进行了谈判，并且签订了两国之间1959—1960年度的换货和支付协定。越朝两国兄弟合作关系的进一步发展，将大大增强社会主义阵营的力量和世界和平的力量。
    我们热烈祝贺以金日成首相为首的朝鲜政府代表团访问越南和越朝会谈的圆满成功，祝贺越朝两国的团结进一步加强和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结日益巩固！
