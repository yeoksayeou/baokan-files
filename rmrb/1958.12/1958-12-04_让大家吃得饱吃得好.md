    Let Everyone Eat Their Fill and Eat Well
    Chen Qimei, Hongqi People's Commune, Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province
    I am a cook in the canteen of the Hongqi People's Commune in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, and I am responsible for the work of the entire canteen. Cooking is not unfamiliar to us women, but in the past we were used to cooking with small pots and stoves. Now we have to cook in large pots, and there are only five of us in total. We have to manage the food for 289 people in the whole team, which is quite complicated. Not to mention the vegetables, just the rice alone, different people have different requirements and tastes. Moreover, the grain we eat in the mountains only accounts for 20% of rice in a year, and 80% is corn, sweet potatoes, sorghum, millet, etc. Everyone requires the canteen to allocate various grains reasonably and have more variety.
    How can we make everyone eat fresh and tasty food? We have put a lot of thought into it and came up with a variety of foods and vegetables. Since the establishment of the canteen, we have made twenty-three kinds of food alone. For example, recently during the autumn harvest and winter planting, the commune members are working overtime at night and have to eat four meals a day. We try to make each meal different: one meal of cornbread, one meal of rice, one meal of fresh sweet potatoes, and one meal of corn soup or porridge. We change it every day. When it comes to improving our lives, there are even more varieties, in addition to the above four, there are noodles, steamed buns, sweet potato cakes, sorghum cakes, sorghum glutinous rice balls, matuo cores, flatbreads, wontons, vegetable buns, meat buns... Oh, I can't explain it all at once.
    How do we take care of different people? For the elderly and children, we open a small stove to make soft and fine food for them. In the afternoon, we also make a snack for the children in the nursery class and the nursery. Some elderly people live far away from the canteen and have difficulty walking back and forth, so we also deliver food to their doorsteps. Grandma Yang Sheng, who is eighty-four years old, eats the food we send and keeps saying that the canteen is good.
    For sick commune members, we have cleaned up a room on the canteen building to serve as a sanatorium for sick commune members. Our cooks can conveniently deliver meals, tea, and water to the patients. Some patients prefer to stay at home, and we also adopt the method of "door-to-door service." Sick meals include noodles, soup, porridge, and various kinds of thick soups. We make whatever the patient likes to eat. As long as we can, we also try to take care of commune members who have chronic illnesses.
    Our canteen provides the most thoughtful care for women in confinement. All tea, soup, and food (including private dishes and snacks) for women in confinement are all taken care of by us. The rice they eat is specially cooked in copper pots and delivered to their doorsteps. When commune member Chen Cuiying gave birth, I delivered her tea, soup, and rice every day.
    In order to save labor, we also use various methods to serve production. For example, whenever there is a busy farming season, a concentrated production effort, or production in a remote area, we deliver food to the construction site. This saves commune members travel time and increases working time. Originally, firewood was arranged by the production team for others to cut, but recently production has been particularly tight, and all the labor in the team has to be used for steel and grain production, so we take time to pick up firewood from the mountains three miles away.
    In the canteen work, I often think: I am also a commune member. If I am asked to engage in production, I can only be energetic if I am full and happy. I, as the leader of the group, have only one rule: take the lead. Since the establishment of the canteen, whether it is cooking, serving food, carrying water, or chopping firewood, I always rush to do it first. At the beginning, our five people divided the work, but now there is actually no division of labor, because everyone is rushing to work. We also brainstorm together. In addition to considering how to make the food variety more diverse and delicious, we also consider how to improve work efficiency, how to be diligent and thrifty, self-reliant, and increase income to improve the lives of commune members. For example, recently a large batch of autumn corn has been harvested. In the next few months, we will have to make cornbread every day, which will definitely be too busy. So we asked the woodworking factory to manufacture a cornbread making machine for us. With this tool, we can make ten cornbread at once, which is more than twice as efficient as manual work.
    We have also made some efforts in saving. In the beginning, there was either too much or not enough food for each meal, which wasted a lot. Later, we let the commune members eat first, and we ate later; the commune members ate fresh food, and we ate leftovers; the commune members ate dry food, and we ate thin food. In this way, grain is basically not wasted.
    The most important way to improve the lives of commune members is to develop sideline production. Now our canteen has eight acres of vegetable fields, which can harvest 160,000 jin of vegetables a year. In addition, we intercrop another 40,000 jin of vegetables. In addition to each person eating one and a half jin of fresh vegetables a day, we can also make 38,000 jin of dried vegetables. The production team's pig farm now has 137 meat pigs. After selling 50 to the state, the rest can be used to improve the lives of commune members. (Attached picture)

    让大家吃得饱吃得好
    浙江省东阳县红旗人民公社  陈七妹
    我是浙江省东阳县红旗人民公社食堂的炊事员，负责整个食堂的工作。烧饭这一行，我们妇女是不生疏的，但是过去烧惯的是小锅小灶，现在要烧大锅饭大锅菜，总共才五个人，要管全队二百八十九人的饭菜，这里面可复杂了；不说菜蔬，就是饭，各种人就有各种不同的要求和口味。还有，我们山里一年里头吃的粮食大米只占20％，80％是玉米、番薯、高粱、小米等，大家要求食堂把各种粮食调配得合理些，花样多一些。
    怎样使大家吃得新鲜有滋味呢？我们动过很多脑筋，搞出了多种多样的饭食、菜蔬。从办食堂以来，光饭食就做过二十三样，像最近秋收冬种时，社员都开夜工，一天要吃四餐，我们就想办法使餐餐饭食不一样：一餐玉米饼、一餐大米饭、一餐鲜番薯、一餐玉米羹或稀饭，天天这样换着吃，逢到改善生活的日子，变换的花样就更多了，除了上面四种以外，还有面条、馒头、番薯糕、高粱饼、高粱糯团、马托棵、面饼、馄饨、菜包子、肉包子……嗳，一下也说不清。
    对各种人怎么照顾呢？对老人、小孩我们就另开小灶，专门给他们做软食、细食吃。下午还给幼儿班、托儿所的孩子做一餐点心吃。个别老年人离食堂比较远，来往走动不便的，我们还送饭上门，八十四岁的羊生娘，吃着我们送去的饭，她就口口声声说食堂好。
    对生病的社员，我们就在食堂楼上收拾出一个房间来做生病社员的休养室，病人的饭菜、茶水我们炊事员就可以顺便送上去。也有个别病员喜欢住在家里，我们也采取“登门服侍”的办法。病号饭有面条、汤水、稀饭和各色羹糊，病人喜欢吃什么，我们就给他做什么。对长期患慢性病的社员，只要办得到，我们也想办法照顾他们。
    我们食堂对产妇照顾得最周到，凡是产妇的茶水、汤、吃食（包括做私菜、点心）全部由我们包下来，吃的饭还专门用铜罐烧好送上门去。社员陈翠英生孩子时，她的茶水、汤饭天天都是我送去的。
    为了节省劳动力，我们还用各种方法来为生产服务，譬如每逢农忙，突击性的生产或远路生产，我们都做到送饭上工地，这样做社员节省了往返时间，劳动的时间就多了。还有本来柴火都是生产队安排别人去砍的，可是最近生产特别紧张，队里劳动力全部要用到钢铁、粮食生产上去，我们就自己抽时间到三里路外的山上去拾柴。
    在食堂工作中，我常想：我也是社员，如果叫我去搞生产，只有吃饱吃好，心里高兴，生产起来才有劲。我做组长的只有一条：带头干。从办食堂以来，无论烧饭、打菜、挑水、劈柴，我自己总是抢在前头干。开始我们五个人分了工，现在实际上已经没有分工了，因为大家都抢着干活。我们还一起动脑筋，除了考虑怎样使饭菜花样多，烧得好吃以外，也考虑怎样提高工效，怎样勤俭节约、自力更生、增加收入来改善社员生活。譬如最近秋玉米大批收下来了，以后几个月里，天天要做玉米饼，肯定是忙不过来的。我们就请木业加工厂给我们制造了一种玉米饼制造机，用这种工具，一下就能做出十个玉米饼，效率比手工提高了二倍多。
    我们在节约方面也作了些努力。开始，每餐食物不是多余就是不够，浪费了不少。后来我们就让社员先吃，我们后吃；社员吃新鲜的，我们吃剩余的；社员吃干的，我们吃稀的。这样一来，粮食基本上不浪费了。
    提高社员生活顶主要的办法是开展副业生产。现在我们食堂有八亩菜田，一年可以收蔬菜十六万斤。另外，再套种蔬菜四万斤。除了每人每天吃鲜菜一斤半以外，还可以多三万八千斤做干菜。生产队的养猪场现在有肉猪一百三十七只，除五十只卖给国家，余下的可以改善社员生活。（附图片）
