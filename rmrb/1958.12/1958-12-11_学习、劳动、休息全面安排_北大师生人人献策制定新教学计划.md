    Learning, Labor, and Rest Comprehensively Arranged
    Peking University Teachers and Students Offer Suggestions to Formulate New Teaching Plan
    (Our Newspaper News) Peking University has adopted a method combining the leadership of the Party Committee with teachers and students to formulate a new teaching plan for each department and major that integrates education, productive labor, and scientific research. Some departments are now teaching in accordance with the new teaching plan. According to the plan, students in each department will basically implement a system of one month of vacation, three months of productive labor, and eight months of study. Each week, activities are arranged for sixty-six hours, including forty-five hours of study (including political theory courses and scientific research), eight hours of productive labor, six hours of physical exercise, and seven hours of Party and League activities and cultural entertainment. It is emphasized that each student should sleep for eight hours and rest on Sundays.
    When formulating the new teaching plan, Peking University first re-examined and revised the development directions and current key scientific research of each department and major, starting from the requirements of strengthening productive labor, basic theory, and developing cutting-edge science. In the social sciences departments, the Philosophy Department will strengthen the teaching and research of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the Chinese Department will strengthen the teaching and research of literary theory, and the Economics Department will strengthen the teaching and research of political economy, especially the socialist part combined with China's actual situation. The science departments will greatly strengthen the teaching and research in various aspects such as radio electronics, atomic physics, geophysics, theoretical physics, radiochemistry, computational mathematics, and biophysics.
    After clarifying the development direction of each department and major, each department formulated a teaching plan that integrates education, productive labor, and scientific research. There is currently no mature experience in this work. Peking University proposed to modify it while working on it, first improve the current courses according to the requirements of the three combinations, so that education, productive labor, and scientific research are initially integrated into a whole, and then improve it after further exploring experience, and formulate a longer-term plan. When formulating the new teaching plan, each department comprehensively considered that it is necessary to unswervingly strengthen the combination of mental and physical labor, the combination of theory and practice, and also to strengthen the education of basic theory. In terms of teaching methods, it is necessary to strengthen the teacher's teaching and also greatly give play to students' initiative and creativity in learning. For example, first and second-year students in the Physics Department focus on learning basic courses such as mathematics and general physics, participate in eight or twelve hours of labor in the factory every week, and are required to master the production technology of metalworking, woodworking, and electrical work, without requiring much scientific research. Fourth and fifth-year students have completed basic theory, and now study specialized courses such as radio and semiconductors, combining learning and practice. That is, the teacher first teaches the basic principles and general production knowledge, then organizes students to participate in production labor related to this aspect in the factory, and finally jointly summarizes research results and experience, and compiles teaching materials. Most social science departments put first and second-year students in factories and rural areas to combine with social struggle practice for education, in order to help students establish a Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. Students currently studying at the school study professional courses while participating in scientific research.
    This time, Peking University mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of implementing the Party's education policy in the previous stage, used their brains to think of ways and put forward constructive opinions. The slogan put forward by the Peking University Party Committee is: everyone contributes ideas and everyone offers suggestions, contributing as much as they can. It also particularly emphasized the unity and cooperation between veteran teachers and young teachers and students. It requires young teachers and students to break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and also humbly learn all useful knowledge from veteran teachers. It requires veteran teachers to believe in young people, rely on young people, learn from each other and make progress together with young people. In this work, teachers and students consciously revolutionized and demonstrated great enthusiasm. After the Party General Branch of the History Department announced the draft outline for reforming the teaching plan, the vast majority of teachers in the department freely combined with students to organize groups to propose revised and supplemented outlines. In less than two days, there were more than fifty various outlines, which were summarized into three outlines after extensive debate. After mutual introductions, a single outline was finally synthesized on this basis. Most people were satisfied with the outline formulated in this way.
    Through this stage of the movement, Peking University has taken a big step forward on the road of implementing the Party's education policy, and is preparing to shift the focus of the next step to the construction of teaching materials, scientific research, and teaching organization in various courses, and combine these with in-depth socialist and communist ideological education, so as to carry out teaching reform to the end.

### 学习、劳动、休息全面安排  北大师生人人献策制定新教学计划

    学习、劳动、休息全面安排
    北大师生人人献策制定新教学计划
    本报讯  北京大学采用党委领导、教师学生相结合的办法订出了各系各专业实行教育、生产劳动、科学研究三结合的新教学计划。现在部分系已经按照新教学计划进行教学。根据计划，各系在校内的学生基本上实行一个月休假、三个月生产劳动、八个月学习的制度。每周按照六十六小时安排各项活动，四十五小时学习（包括政治理论课和科学研究），八小时生产劳动，六小时体育锻炼，七小时党团组织和文化娱乐活动。强调每个学生睡眠八小时，星期天休息。
    北京大学在制订新的教学计划时，先从加强生产劳动、基本理论和发展尖端科学的要求出发，重新审查修订了各系各专业的发展方向和当前科学研究的重点。在社会科学各系里，哲学系将加强辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的教学、研究，中文系将加强文艺理论的教学、研究，经济系将加强政治经济学特别是结合中国实际的社会主义部分的教学、研究。理科各系则将大大加强有关无线电电子学、原子物理、地球物理、理论物理、放射化学、计算数学、生物物理等多方面的教学和研究。
    在明确了各系各专业的发展方向后，各系制订了教育、生产劳动、科学研究三者相互结合的教学计划。这项工作目前还没有成熟的经验，北大提出边作边改，先把目前的课程根据三结合的要求加以改进，使教育、生产劳动、科学研究初步地拧成一个整体，待进一步摸索出经验后再改进，制订比较长远的计划。各系在制订新的教学计划时都比较全面地考虑了既要坚定不移地加强脑力劳动和体力劳动的结合，理论和实际的结合，也要加强基础理论的教育，在教学方法上既要加强教师的教导，也要大大发挥学生学习的主动性和创造性。如物理系一二年级学生就把重点放在学习数学、普通物理等基础课上，每周在工厂里参加八小时或十二小时的劳动，并要求掌握金工、木工、电工等工种的生产技术，而不要求多搞科学研究。四五年级学生已学完基础理论，现在学无线电、半导体等专业课，就把学习和实践结合起来进行。即先由教师讲授基本原理和一般的生产知识，然后组织学生到工厂参加有关这方面的生产劳动，最后共同总结研究成果和经验，并编写教材。社会科学各系多数都把一二年级放到工厂农村结合社会斗争实践进行教育，以便帮助学生树立马列主义的立场、观点、方法。目前在校内学习的学生一面学习专业课，一面参加科学研究。
    北京大学这次制订教学计划的工作，发动群众总结前一阶段贯彻执行党的教育方针的经验，动脑筋想办法提建设性的意见。北大党委提出的口号是：人人出谋个个献策，有一分热发一分光。并特别强调老教师和青年师生团结合作。要求青年师生既要破除迷信，敢想、敢说、敢干，也要虚心向老教师学习一切有用的知识。要求老教师相信青年、依靠青年，教学相长和青年一道跃进。在这项工作中教师和学生都自觉革命发挥了很大的积极性。历史系党总支把改革教学计划的大纲草稿公布后，全系绝大多数的教师都和学生自由结合组织小组提出修改和补充的大纲，不到两天时间所提出的各种大纲就有五十多个，经过大争大辩后归纳成三个大纲，经过互相介绍，最后在这个基础上综合成一个大纲。这样订出来的大纲绝大多数的人都感到满意。
    经过这一阶段的运动北京大学在贯彻执行党的教育方针的大道上又向前迈进了一大步，准备下一步的中心转入各门课程的教材、科学研究、教学组织等建设，并结合这些深入社会主义、共产主义思想教育，以便把教学改革进行到底。（附图片）
