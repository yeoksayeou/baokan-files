    Xi'an, December 24 (reported by this newspaper) People's communes in various parts of Shaanxi Province, in response to the new situation arising from changing from extensive planting with low yields to intensive planting with high yields, are actively improving wheat field management techniques and enhancing the quality of management to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest next year.
    This year, among the 23 million mu of wheat fields sown in Shaanxi Province, 4.95 million mu are high-yield wheat fields. These high-yield fields have all implemented deep plowing and high-density planting. After implementing high-density planting, the water required by wheat needs to increase from an average of 70 cubic meters per mu in the past to 100 cubic meters, and it needs to be irrigated multiple times in appropriate amounts. The problems of poor ventilation and insufficient sunlight after dense planting also need to be solved. Preventing lodging is particularly important, and measures such as high-altitude operations need to be taken to prevent wind damage. These are all new problems that have not been encountered in past field management.
    In light of this new situation, people's communes in various parts of Shaanxi Province have studied the experiences and lessons learned from deep plowing and dense planting of wheat in the previous season and proposed the slogan of "knowing the cold, knowing the heat, knowing hunger, and knowing satiety." They have adopted new wheat field management techniques tailored to local conditions:
    In terms of irrigation: People's communes in the Guanzhong major wheat-producing area, such as the Wei-Hui and Jing-Hui irrigation areas, have changed from the past practice of flooding large plots. They have installed underground irrigation pipes for more than 300 high-yield wheat fields and plan to use small-quota irrigation to provide the required amount of water, improving the water retention capacity of high-yield wheat fields and keeping the ground soft to promote rapid seedling development. Weinan and Lintong counties have poked small holes in the rows of high-yield wheat fields with wooden or iron sticks. During irrigation, the water dissolves the fertilizer and seeps into the small holes, which is quickly absorbed by the wheat. Farmers in southern Shaanxi are making sprinkler irrigation facilities for high-yield wheat fields based on the local characteristics of many slopes, short field ridges, and small plots. According to incomplete statistics from Nanzheng and Baocheng counties and cities, they have already used the pressure of the water head difference in the irrigation area to bury ceramic pipes in the soil layer at the high difference points of the irrigation area as water diversion pipes. They then connect connecting pipes below and use galvanized iron to make sprinklers on the connecting pipes. Then, they move back and forth along the field surface during irrigation, creating fifteen earthen artificial rainmakers. This method of irrigation can moisten the ground air layer, reduce the row temperature of high-yield wheat fields, and overcome the poor ventilation after high-density planting.
    In terms of fertilization: Various regions have not only paid attention to the amount of fertilizer applied but also to the combination of fertilizers. At the same time, they have used a large amount of plant ash to prevent lodging. People's communes in Wugong, Sanyuan, and Yao counties have all carried out mixed topdressing of quick-acting organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers in this year's fertilization of high-yield wheat fields, with appropriate coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. People's communes in Gaoling and Jingyang counties have already applied rotted human manure and plant ash once to 67,000 mu of first- and second-grade high-yield wheat fields. In Chang'an County, many people's communes first shallowly hoe, then irrigate before applying plant ash, so that the potassium decomposed from the plant ash quickly penetrates into the soil and is absorbed and utilized by the wheat, promoting the development of basal nodes. In order not to let the fertilizer press on the wheat seedlings and affect wheat growth, the applied fertilizer is also crushed, harrowed, and sieved.
    In terms of frost and wind prevention: Based on the situation that ground cracks easily occur after winter irrigation in previous years, various regions have carried out winter hoeing, winter harrowing, and winter rolling to prevent cold and protect seedlings for high-yield wheat fields this year. Many production teams in Liquan and Jingyang counties have made straw curtains for high-yield wheat fields using bean stalks and other materials. During the day, the straw curtains are rolled up and placed on the edge of the field to allow the wheat seedlings to absorb sunlight. At night, the straw curtains are laid down to cover the wheat seedlings to keep them warm and prevent frost. Various regions have also taken early measures to prevent wind and lodging. The Qiangbai People's Commune in Dali County has planted hedges around the high-yield wheat fields and strung iron wires around each ridge to prevent lodging and solve the problems of ventilation and light transmission. They have also planted a wooden stake every two steps for future high-altitude operations. The sandy areas along the Great Wall in Yulin Prefecture have also begun to prevent the shifting sand from moving south and damaging the wheat seedlings. Farmers in Dingbian County have built earth dikes up to two chi high around more than 4,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields and built walls two to five chi high around all the high-yield wheat fields in more than 3,000 mu of river land.

### 适应小麦深耕和高度密植的新情况  创造新方法  管好高产田  陕西省的一套技术措施踏实细致

    适应小麦深耕和高度密植的新情况
    创造新方法  管好高产田
    陕西省的一套技术措施踏实细致
    本报西安24日电  陕西省各地人民公社针对改广种薄收为少种多收后出现的新情况，积极改进小麦田间管理技术，提高管理质量，为明年丰收打好基础。
    今年陕西省在已播种的二千三百多万亩麦田中有四百九十五万亩是小麦高产田。这些高产田都实行了深耕和高度密植。实行高度密植后，小麦需要的水分要由过去每亩平均七十方增加到一百方，而且需要多次按量灌溉。密植后通风不良和日照不足的问题也需要解决。防止倒伏特别重要，此外还要采取高空作业等措施来防风。这些都是过去田间管理中没有遇到过的新问题。
    根据这种新情况，陕西各地人民公社研究了上一季小麦深耕密植的经验教训，提出要作到知冷知热知饥知饱的口号，因地制宜地采取了新的小麦田间管理的技术措施：
    在灌溉方面：关中主要产麦区渭惠、泾惠渠灌溉区的人民公社已改变了过去大畦漫灌的作法，给三百多块小麦高产田安装了地下灌溉管道，计划用小定额灌溉，做到要多少水浇多少水，提高小麦高产田保水能力，使地面经常保持松软状态，促进麦苗迅速发育。渭南、临潼县给小麦高产田的行间用木棍或铁棍扎了小窟窿，灌溉时水就能把肥料溶解渗入小窟窿内，很快为小麦吸收。陕南农民正在根据当地山坡多，地埂短，地块小的特点，给小麦高产田作喷灌设施。据南郑、褒城等县、市的不完全统计，已经利用灌区高差水的压力作用，将陶管埋在灌区高差处的土层内，作为引水管，下面安接连管，再在接连管上用白铁作喷头，然后在灌水时顺着田面前后移动的办法，作出十五个土人工降雨器。用这种方法灌溉可以润湿地面空气层、降低小麦高产田的行间温度，克服在高度密植后的通风不良。
    在施肥方面：各地不仅注意了施肥数量，还注意了肥料的搭配；同时，为了防止倒伏而大量施用草木灰。武功、三原、耀县的人民公社在今年给小麦高产田施肥中都进行了速效有机肥料与化学肥料混合追施，氮磷钾适当配合。高陵、泾阳两县的人民公社已经给六万七千亩一级和二级小麦高产田施了一次腐烂的人粪尿，一次草木灰。长安县有许多人民公社在施草木灰前，先浅锄，后灌溉，使草木灰分解出的钾，很快渗入土壤内，被小麦吸收利用，促进基节发育。为了不使肥料压住麦苗，影响小麦生长，还把所施的肥料打碎、耱烂和过筛。
    在防冻、防风方面，各地根据历年冬灌后容易发生地皮裂缝的情况，今年对高产麦田都进行了冬锄冬耙耱以防寒保苗。醴泉、泾阳县的人民公社中有许多生产队用豆秆等给高产麦田打了草帘。白天把草帘卷起来放在地头上，让麦苗吸收阳光。晚上把草帘放开给麦苗盖上，保暖防霜。各地还及早采取措施防风防倒伏，大荔县羌白人民公社已经在小麦丰产田周围栽了篱笆，每畦的周围拉了铁丝，准备防止倒伏和解决通风透光问题，还给每隔两步远栽了一个木桩，以便将来高空作业。榆林专区长城沿线的风沙区也开始动手防止卷沙南下打坏麦苗。定边县农民已经给四千多亩小麦高产田的周围筑了高达二尺的地垸，给三千多亩川地小麦高产田的周围全部打了二尺到五尺高的围墙。
