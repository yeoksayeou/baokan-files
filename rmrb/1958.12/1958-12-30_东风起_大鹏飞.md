    The East Wind Rises, The Roc Soars
    Wen Shan
    Standing on the deck of a ten-thousand-ton giant ship, several stories high, watching the vast clouds and mist over the Bohai Sea, and the boundless waves in the twilight; the setting sun has already descended west of the Liaodong Peninsula, and the electric welders send up clusters of silver sparks in mid-air, brilliant and dazzling, truly like the fireworks over Tiananmen Square on National Day...
    The Dalian Shipyard, with the world's fastest speed, built China's first modern ocean-going giant ship in a shipbuilding cycle (from keel laying to launching) of only fifty-eight days. In Japan, the shipbuilding cycle is three months; in the UK, it takes six months.
    It's embarrassing to say, but according to a Japanese delegation that visited this factory, it shouldn't even hang the sign of a "shipyard." They said, "You are not a shipyard, but a repair yard." I don't know what a capitalist gentleman's shipyard looks like, but comparing it to some of the large factories I've seen in China, it's quite surprising that such a behemoth was built here. This shipyard has quite a few docks for repairing ships, but the factory buildings and workshops are really inconspicuous. Some of the workshops look like old warehouses at first glance. However, that steel mountain—a giant ship with a deadweight of 13,400 tons and a displacement of 22,100 tons—is beautifully resting against that pile of unimpressive, messily arranged houses; cranes, people on work platforms, etc., are surrounding the big ship, which looks more like "ants gnawing at a bone" than small machines processing large parts.
    Originally, this was just a small factory with dozens of people. Around 1940, it could only do patching and painting, and major repairs were out of the question. The Japanese devils started the Pacific War, and the factory grew to two thousand people. After liberation, the Soviet Union gave us a lot of help, and the factory developed greatly, laying the technical foundation for today. Now, because of the poor foundation, we are not only building ships, but also building the world's most modern, automatically controlled ten-thousand-ton ocean-going giant ships.
    Moreover, building the ship is not enough; it's also one month faster than the Japanese and twice as fast as the British. That's the wonderful part!
    In the past, Chinese people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation had many unique characteristics. The reactionary classes in China have made many creations in reducing speed: for example, men had to walk with square steps, like the main characters on the opera stage, to be considered refined; women had to bind their feet, so-called "lotus steps," which no other country in the world has. The consequence of this kind of creation is that until the Kuomintang collapsed, Chinese farmers were still working like the figures in ancient Han and Tang paintings. Precisely because of taking square steps, we fell behind, and those who fall behind are beaten, so we were constantly beaten. All the imperialists have beaten us. I often remember the words of a Russian poet before the revolution: "Mother Russia, you are both poor and rich, you are both strong and weak." It sounds like talking about our dear motherland. Again, I saw the American warships invading the Huangpu River; with their gun covers removed, the black muzzles were pointing directly at the buildings on the Bund, and also at me, a Chinese walking on the street. This was a scene thirteen years ago, but the stimulation of those gun muzzles has not been diluted by time even now!
    Therefore, when I saw the heroic poem written on the sixty-meter-high chimney of the No. 10 blast furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel, I couldn't help but have many feelings. The big chimney, towering into the sky, the snow-white characters, larger than door panels, can be seen from far away. The poem says:
    Everyone holds high the red flag,
    Working hard to create miracles with one heart,
    The world knows the "Surpassing Britain" slogan,
    Construction speed is number one.
    What a wonderful poem full of heroism! Not exaggerated at all, the facts are just like that. The No. 10 blast furnace is one of the largest and most advanced blast furnaces in the world. It has a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, using 14,300 tons of refractory bricks alone, and the metal components and mechanical equipment reached 7,000 tons. 250,000 cubic meters of soil were excavated during construction. Such a blast furnace usually takes one and a half years to complete in the UK and the US, and at least one year at the fastest, but in the hands of the Chinese working class during the Great Leap Forward, it only took four months and three days from pouring concrete to tapping iron!
    In the dark night, standing under the mythic giant-like blast furnace, watching the red-hot molten iron, with raging flames, like tamed stream water, constantly flowing under the hands of the ironworkers; and then, from the platform two stories high, like a waterfall, cascading into the large tanks brought by the train. Looking at this solemn scene, it is really hard to imagine that just over a hundred days ago, this was just an empty piece of land with nothing, and you cannot but feel full of respect for those heroic builders!
    When I arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel, the "King of Open Hearth Furnaces" had just been completed and put into production. Looking through the purple glass, through the round hole in the furnace door, the white-hot molten steel in the furnace was like a pond, boiling happily. There is an invincible force in the hearts of 600 million people, just like the high temperature of melting steel and iron, which can subdue all difficulties and obstacles. These two world's largest No. 23 and 24 open hearth furnaces, each with a capacity of 600 tons, not only surpass Britain and the United States in size, but also have the world's fastest construction speed. They are as large as two buildings side by side, but when installing the No. 24 furnace, only eighteen days were used to complete the installation of thousands of tons of components and refractory bricks, and thus a Chu Overlord and a Li Yuanba entered the ranks of struggling for 1070 ahead of schedule. How strong should the iron arms of the Chinese working class be now! When I looked at the No. 10 blast furnace and the "King of Open Hearth Furnaces," I couldn't help but think of the "famous saying" that the Japanese devils gave us when they were about to leave Anshan Iron and Steel: "Now that you have blast furnaces, take them to plant sorghum!" This sentence has a high degree of artistry, is very sharp, and will be useful in writing the history of industrial development of the People's Republic of China in the future.
    Our great People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the helmsman, the Chinese Communist Party, with 600 million people rejoicing and encouraging each other, united in purpose, is advancing at an unprecedented speed in human history, riding the wind and waves. Double the cotton, double the steel, our one year is equivalent to the thirty years of British and French imperialism! This speed is the result of the great liberation of thought and the display of the spirit of ownership of the 600 million people. But Dulles and a handful of imperialist vermin say that this is "slavery," cruel "slavery"! In the world, who knows more than the Chinese people what slavery means? Who hates slavery more than we do? Dulles and his predecessors—the Japanese devils—taught us too much! A month ago, next to the Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine, I saw the monument to the "Pingdingshan Incident," which will forever record the towering crimes of the imperialist beasts: the Japanese army surrounded and massacred the men, women, old, and young of the entire miners' village in Pingdingshan with machine guns, a total of several thousand people, a bloodbath of Pingdingshan! And now, Dulles and his Pentagon cronies are arming Japanese militarism, feeding meat to the jackals, we should thank Dulles for the reminder!
    I want to tell you about a painting that I saw in many cities and factories in Northeast China. This painting will not be liked by imperialists and revisionists, they will say it is a "formula," but we see from this "formula" the universal common aspirations of the Chinese working people, and see the determination of the Chinese people to not only get rid of slavery forever in politics and economy, but also to liberate themselves forever in the field of culture and science and become the masters of the world. The common image of these paintings is: a tall and handsome Chinese worker, wearing blue overalls, smiling, holding a steel drill in one hand, and raising a book in the other, with the six characters "Cultural and Technical Revolution" written on the book cover. These paintings stand at the gates of factories, or in the most conspicuous places on the streets, calling on the working people to master science and study cultural knowledge. Dulles, of course, understands that such paintings are called propaganda paintings. What is being promoted? Not the policy of fooling the people, not promoting religion and obedience, but promoting the "Cultural and Technical Revolution"! This is the "slavery" invented by Dulles and implemented by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government. This kind of "slavery" is really very cruel for Dulles! Because without such "slavery," Dulles's Western "freedom"—the various new-style torture instruments and assassination pistols of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization—can replace it; American warships can be rampant and enter and leave China's inland rivers and territorial waters as if they were in no man's land!
    Our great motherland, just like the roc that "cuts through the clouds and carries the blue sky," that "flies in anger, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky," "when the roc migrates to the South Sea, it strikes the water for three thousand li, spirals upward ninety thousand li," now that the east wind has risen, the sea has moved, it is the time for the roc to fly to the wondrous realm of the South Pole Tianchi to make its "free and unfettered journey." Dulles, whose life is like the "morning mushroom," and the imperialist sparrows that "leap up, but not more than a few ren," you stretch your necks and watch the roc flying ninety thousand li above your heads, migrating south to the communist "wondrous realm of Tianchi"!

    东风起  大鹏飞
    闻山
    登上几层楼高的万吨巨轮的甲板，在暮色中看渤海上的茫茫云雾，万顷波涛；落日已从辽东半岛西边下去，电焊工在半空中飞起簇簇银花，光辉灿烂，真似国庆节天安门上的焰火……
    大连造船厂，以世界最快的速度，造船台周期（从铺底到下水）仅仅五十八天，建造了中国第一艘现代化远洋巨轮。在日本，船台周期是三个月；英国，得六个月。
    说来也惭愧，这个厂子，按日本一个代表团参观后的说法，是连
  “造船厂”的招牌也不该挂的。他们说：“你们不是造船厂，是修船厂。”我不知道资本主义老爷的造船厂是什么个样子，但与我看到过的一些中国的大工厂比较，像它这个样子，居然就造了这么个庞然大物，也实在有点出奇。这个船厂，修船的船坞倒是有不少，厂房、车间，就实在不显眼。有的车间，骤看来，跟旧仓库似的。可是，那座钢山——载重量一万三千四百吨、排水量二万二千一百吨的巨轮，就漂漂亮亮地正靠着那一堆很不神气、摆得乱七八糟的房子；起重机、工作架上的人等等，团团围绕着大船，这比看小机器加工大部件，可更像“蚂蚁啃骨头”。
    最早，这只是个几十人的小厂子，1940年前后，也只能补补贴贴，刷刷油还行，大修就不中。日本鬼子打起了太平洋战争，才发展到二千人，解放后，苏联给我们许多帮助，工厂有了很大发展，奠定了今天的技术基础。现在，可是因为基础差，不但造船，而且造出了世界上最新式的自动操纵的万吨级远洋巨轮。
    而且，船造出来不算，还比日本人快了一个月，比英国尽快了两倍。妙就妙在这里了！
    过去中国人的衣食住行，都有许多特点，中国的反动阶级在减低速度这方面，就有过不少创造：譬如男人走路，要踱方步，像戏台上的生角那样，才算斯文；女人要包小脚，所谓“步步莲花”，这是世界上哪一个国家都没有的。这种创造的后果，是直到国民党垮台，中国农民还像汉、唐古画里的人物一样地劳动。正因为踱方步，所以落后，而落后者是要挨打的，于是我们不断挨打。所有帝国主义都打过我们。我常常记起革命前一位俄罗斯诗人的话：“俄罗斯母亲呵，你又贫穷又富饶，你又强大又软弱。”这听来就像在说我们亲爱的祖国，我眼前又出现了侵入黄浦江的美国军舰；它褪下了炮衣，黑黝黝的炮口就正对着外滩的大楼，也对着我这个走在街上的中国人。这是十三年前的景象了，但那些炮口的刺激性，至今还并未被时间冲淡！
    因此，当我在鞍钢看到那写在十号高炉六十公尺高的烟囱上的英雄诗，就不能不有许多感触。大烟囱，高插云霄，雪白的字，比门板还大，老远老远就看得见。诗云：
    人人高举大红旗，
    苦干一心创奇迹，
    世人皆知超英号，
    建设速度数第一。
    这是多好的英雄气概的诗呵！一点不虚夸，事实就是如此。第十号高炉，是世界最大最先进的高炉之一。容积一千五百一十三立方公尺，光耐火砖就用了一万四千三百吨，金属构件和机械设备达七千吨，建造时挖的土有二十五万立方公尺。炉底装有放射性元素，可以探测铁水侵蚀炉底情况。像这样的高炉，在英、美一般是一年半完工，快也要一年，但是在大跃进的中国工人阶级手里，从浇灌混凝土到出铁，只用了四个月零三天！
    黑夜里，站在神话中的巨人似的高炉底下，看通红的铁水，带着熊熊火焰，像驯服的溪水，在炼铁工人手下，不断涌流；再从二层楼高的平台上，像瀑布似的，飞泄到火车运来的大罐里去。看着这壮严的图景，你真很难想像，一百多天之前，这里只是一片一无所有的空地，而对那些英雄的建设者们，你也就不能不满怀尊敬！
    我到鞍钢时，“平炉之王”刚修建完工，投入生产。透过紫色的玻璃，从炉门上的圆孔望进去，白热的钢水在炉里，就像一个池塘，沸腾得正欢。六亿人民心里有一股无坚不摧的力量，就像这融钢化铁的高温，能驯服一切艰难阻碍。这两座全世界最大的二十三、二十四号平炉，容量各六百吨，不但体积超英压美，而且建造速度之快，也是世界第一。它们大得像并排的两座楼房，但安装二十四号炉时，仅仅十八天，就完成了几千吨的构件和耐火砖的装砌工程，于是乎在为1070斗争的行列里，提前走进来了一个楚霸王和一个李元霸。中国工人阶级的铁膀子，现在该有多硬呵！当我看着十号高炉和“平炉之王”的时候，也就不由得想起日本鬼子临离鞍钢时赠给我们的那句“名言”：“你们现在有了高炉了，拿去种高粱吧！”这句话有高度的艺术性，尖刻得很，将来写中华人民共和国工业发展史，这话都用得着。
    伟大的中华人民共和国，正在英明的舵手中国共产党的领导下，六亿人民欢欣鼓舞，同心同德，以人类历史上从未有过的高速，乘风破浪前进。棉，翻一番，钢，也翻一番，我们一年，顶英、法帝国主义三十年！这个速度，是六亿人民思想大解放、发挥主人翁的干劲的结果。可是杜勒斯和一小撮帝国主义的虫豸们却说，这是“奴役”，是残酷的“奴役”！在世界上，有谁比中国人民更懂得什么叫做奴役？有谁比我们更痛恨奴役？杜勒斯和他的前辈——日本鬼子教给我们的太丰富了！一个月之前，在抚顺露天矿旁边，我看到了“平顶山事件”的纪念碑，它永远记载着帝国主义禽兽的滔天罪恶：日本军队在平顶山用机枪包围屠杀了整个矿工村子的男女老幼，一共几千人，血洗平顶山！而现在，杜勒斯和他五角大楼的同伙们，又在武装日本军国主义，给豺狼喂肉，我们应该感谢杜勒斯的提醒！
    我要告诉你们，我在东北许多城市工厂都看到的一幅画。这幅画，帝国主义和修正主义者是不会喜欢的，会说这是“公式”，而我们却从这个“公式”里看到了中国劳动人民普遍的共同的愿望，看到中国人民不但要在政治上、经济上永远摆脱奴役、而且要在文化科学的领域里永远解放自己、成为世界主宰的决心。这些画的共同的形象是：一个高大英俊的中国工人，穿着蓝色的工作服，微笑着，一只手拿着钢钎，一只手举起一本书，书面上写着“文化技术革命”六个大字。这些画，矗立在工厂的大门口，或者是街头最触目的地方，号召劳动人民要掌握科学，学习文化知识。这样的画，杜勒斯当然懂得，叫做宣传画。宣传什么呢？不是宣传“民可使由之，不可使知之”的愚民政策，不是宣传宗教、驯服，而是宣传“文化技术革命”！这就是杜勒斯发明的、中国共产党和中国人民政府实行的“奴役”。这种“奴役”，对杜勒斯来说，实在是十分残酷的！因为没有这样的“奴役”，那杜勒斯的西方的“自由”——中美合作所的各种新式刑具、暗杀手枪，就可以来代替它了；美国军舰就可以飞扬跋扈、出入中国的内河领海、如入无人之境了！
    我们伟大的祖国，正如“绝云气，负青天”、“怒而飞，其翼若垂天之云”的大鹏，“鹏之徙于南冥也，水击三千里，抟扶摇而上者九万里”，如今东风起了，大海动了，正是大鹏飞向南极天池妙境作“逍遥游”的时候，命如“朝菌”的杜勒斯，“腾跃而上，不过数仞”的帝国主义小麻雀们，你们伸长脖子，看大鹏在你们头顶上九万里的高空、向共产主义的“天池妙境”南徙吧！
