    Being a Good Mother to Children
    Zhang Wei, Director of the Huangpu District Factory Joint Nursery in Shanghai

    When I first joined the nursery work, I was ideologically resistant. I thought I was an intellectual, and why should I be a nanny when I could do any other job? Living with the children, their innocent and lively images, and their pure and sincere feelings gradually changed my views after a few months. In particular, I often heard mothers say, "Now that the children are taken care of and educated, we can focus on production with peace of mind!" These words also moved me.

    Before the rectification campaign, when parents raised concerns about our shortcomings, the staff in the nursery felt aggrieved, as if "serving people" was a thankless job, having to watch faces and be treated as inferior, and they always felt resistant. After the rectification campaign, we clarified that nursery work is also part of building socialism, and that nurturing children is an important political task. Our work became particularly meticulous. Once, we saw a child eating, and they spat out the food as soon as it entered their mouth. We investigated: the food wasn't hot, so why were they spitting it out? It turned out that the spoon was stuck in the rice and had burned the child. We immediately told the cooks to put the spoon in a separate bowl next time. When giving children a bedpan at night, we gently and affectionately pressed our faces against the child's face and softly called their name, so they wouldn't feel suddenly pulled out of the blanket. If a child was sick, we would take care of them with utmost patience. Sometimes mothers were busy on their days off, and we were afraid the children would get bored staying in the nursery, so we would take them to the park to play and buy them some fruit to eat. Once, I ran into a parent on the road, and she asked, "Where are you taking them?" I said, "Taking them out to play and buying them some things." She happily said, "You're so good, you treat the children in the nursery like your own!"

    We tried every possible way to help mothers with their production. Once, a child in the nursery was fourteen months old and still hadn't been weaned, because the mother was busy with production and had difficulty weaning the child. I obtained the mother's consent and took over the weaning process. I took the child home at night. With a large family and few beds, I persuaded my own child to sleep on the floor and convinced him to give his milk to the little sibling. A week later, when the mother came to the nursery, she saw that the child was growing well and was both happy and excited.

    The Great Leap Forward in all areas further inspired us, prompting me to think that nursery work should also have a Great Leap Forward. I discussed with everyone how to further reduce mothers' worries about their children and how to help children grow better. Therefore, in the first half of this year, the nannies in the nursery launched a campaign to advance towards becoming "all-rounders." We learned to give the children haircuts, injections, make clothes, make all kinds of snacks... etc., and also designed a hygienic, economical, and good shower facility.

    Recently, our nursery has been open to mothers 24 hours a day, and we help them solve problems at any time.

    做孩子们的好妈妈
    上海市黄浦区工厂联合托儿所所长  张维
    我在刚刚参加保育工作的时候，思想不通，认为自己是个知识分子，什么工作不好做，却去当保姆？和孩子们生活在一起，几个月后，那天真活泼的形象，纯洁真诚的感情，渐渐使我改变了看法。特别是常常听到妈妈们这样讲：“孩子有人管了，有人教养了，生产起来也安心了！”这些话也打动了我。
    在整风以前，家长对我们缺点提出意见的时候，所内工作人员就像受了委曲似的，感到“侍候人”的工作要受气，看脸嘴的，是低一等的，总有抵触情绪。整风以后，我们明确了保育工作也是建设社会主义的一部分，培养孩子是一项重要的政治任务。我们的工作就特别细致起来。有一次看到孩子吃饭，一口送进去，满口吐出来，我们就研究：饭又不烫，为什么吐出来？原来是匙插在饭中，烫痛了孩子。我们就立即告诉炊事员同志下次另外弄一只碗放匙。夜里给孩子小便，我们把自己的脸亲切地贴牢孩子的脸，轻轻地叫他的名字，不使他觉得突然地从被里被拉出来。如果孩子病了，我们更是百般耐心看护。有些妈妈在休息日没功夫，我们怕孩子留在所里气闷，就带着他们到公园里去玩玩，也买点水果给他们吃。有一次，在路上碰到一位家长，她问：“你带着他们啥地方去？”我讲：“带他们玩玩去，买点东西。”她高兴地说：“你太好了，对所里的孩子像亲妈一样。”
    我们千方百计地想办法支援妈妈们搞好生产。有一次，所里一个孩子已经十四个月了，还没有断奶，原因是妈妈生产忙，断奶有困难。我就征得妈妈的同意由我代为断奶。晚上我把孩子带到家里，家里人多床少，我就动员自己的孩子睡在地板上，再说服他把牛奶让给小弟弟吃。一星期后，妈妈到所里来，看见孩子长得很好，又高兴又激动。
    各方面大跃进更鼓舞了我们，促使我想到保育工作也应该来个大跃进。我就和大家商量，研究如何进一步减少妈妈对孩子的操心，如何使孩子生长得更好，因此在今年上半年，所里阿姨们掀起了向“多面手”进军的热潮。我们学习给孩子们剃头，打针，做衣裳，做各种各样的点心……等，还设计了一只符合卫生要求又节约又好的冲淋设备。
    最近，我们所内一天二十四小时向妈妈们开放，随时有问题，随时帮助妈妈解决。
