Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 9th December: At the All-African People's Conference this morning, the Algerian representative, Fanon, said that African people could adopt any method to fight for freedom according to their specific conditions and the attitude of the enemies they face.

He said that violent means should not be ruled out, and African people can use force to take back what belongs to them.

This speech by the Algerian representative was met with long and stormy cheers and applause from the representatives, indicating that most of the representatives admired the fearless fighting spirit of the heroic Algerian people.

In his speech, Fanon demanded that the imperialists withdraw from Africa and called on the African people to unite and consolidate their positions against the imperialists. He said that every African must be a warrior against the imperialists. He said that the struggles of individual nations should not be separated from the struggle of the entire African continent.

The head of the delegation of the United Arab Republic, Galal, was also warmly applauded and welcomed at this morning's meeting. In his speech, he said that the imperialists are trying to change their tactics in an attempt to avoid the doomsday they face in Africa. To avoid this fate, they are doing everything possible to oppose the will and actions of Africans to unite, to alienate relations between independent African countries, and to alienate them from regions still under foreign rule struggling for independence. At the same time, they are trying to alienate the relations between the Asian and African people.

Galal said that one of the main goals of this conference should be to exchange experiences in dealing with colonialism and imperialism.

He also said that the imperialists regard Africa as their last stronghold. Since they have lost Asia, Africa has become even more important to them. They believe that Asian-African solidarity is a huge danger to them. They are worried about the Bandung Conference, the Cairo Conference, and the last Accra Conference. They are worried about this conference, and they will continue to worry until the end of colonialism and imperialism.

He said: "We need unity and cooperation, especially understanding, to solve Africa's huge problems."

Galal praised the union of Guinea and Ghana, and he believes this is a pioneer of Pan-African unity.

After the Algerian representative spoke at this morning's meeting, the chairman of the meeting, Mboya (Kenya), made a brief speech.

He said that the Algerian issue shows that Western policy has gone bankrupt. Western countries supply weapons to France, allowing France to use them to suppress the Algerian people.

He also said that in the struggle of the African people, whether to use force or peaceful means depends on the attitude of Western countries.

However, Mboya advised Western countries to use so-called "positive democracy" to deal with what he called "international communism."

Prior to this, Mboya spoke at yesterday afternoon's meeting, advocating that Africa "has complete independence and neutrality." He opposed the establishment of military bases in Africa. In his speech, he criticized the policies of France and Britain, while expressing praise for the United States.

Representatives from Senegal, Guinea, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Liberia also spoke at this morning's meeting.

The Senegalese representative, Abdoulaye Ly, said that despite France's fabrication of false referendums, Senegal demands immediate independence.

He also presented a draft resolution on behalf of his delegation. The draft said that the conference should demand that the French government immediately recognize the independence of French overseas territories and assist the rapid convening of the Constitutional Assembly of Black Africa to form a new federal state.

The morning meeting adjourned after the Liberian representative spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 8th December: At today's All-African People's Conference, after Nkrumah spoke, the chairman of the conference, Mboya (Kenya), who had just arrived from London, introduced each delegation to the conference one by one, among which the heroic Algerian delegation and the newly independent Guinean delegation received warm applause. Mboya then made a brief speech saying that two hundred million Africans spoke with one voice and were of one mind, for only one purpose, which is freedom. Now is the time to realize their long-cherished ideals.

At the conference, when the congratulatory telegrams from Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Zhou Enlai, Premier of China, and Kim Il-sung, Premier of North Korea, were read out, the representatives applauded warmly. The conference also read congratulatory telegrams from Asian and African countries, Bulgaria, Democratic Germany, the World Peace Council, and famous people such as Paul Robeson and Du Bois. The conference also read congratulatory telegrams from the British Governor-General in Ghana and the United States.

At the opening ceremony, two hundred representatives from fifty organizations in twenty-five countries, as well as a large number of observers and journalists, crowded the conference hall. On the wall behind the rostrum hung a painting of the yellow earth, the center of which was black Africa under a red torch. It read: "No interference in Africa, Africa must be free." On the opposite wall hung a painting of an African smashing the shackles on his body. It read: "People of Africa, unite," "We want freedom and dignity." (Attached picture)

    全非人民大会上发出响亮的呼声
    非洲人团结起来赶走帝国主义
    阿尔及利亚代表指出非洲人民有权用武力争取自由
    新华社阿克拉9日电  在全非人民大会今天上午会议上，阿尔及利亚代表凡农说，非洲各族人民可以按照他们的具体条件和他们所面对的敌人的态度来采取任何方法争取自由。
    他说，不应当排除暴力手段，非洲各族人民能够使用武力来收回属于他们的东西。
    这位阿尔及利亚代表的发言博得了代表们经久不息的暴风雨般的欢呼喝采，这表明大多数代表都钦佩英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的大无畏的斗志。
    凡农在他的演说中要求帝国主义者退出非洲，并且要求非洲各族人民团结起来，巩固他们反对帝国主义者的阵地。他说，每一个非洲人都必须是一个反对帝国主义者的战士。他说，不应当把各民族的斗争同整个非洲的斗争分离开来。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团长加拉勒在今天上午会议上也受到了热烈的鼓掌欢迎。他在发言中说，帝国主义者力图改变他们的策略，想避免他们在非洲面临的末日。为了避免这种命运，他们尽一切力量反对非洲人团结他们的意志和行动，离间非洲独立国家之间的关系，离间它们同仍在外国统治下进行争取独立斗争的地区之间的关系。同时，他们试图离间亚非人民的关系。
    加拉勒说，这次会议的主要目标之一应当是交流对付殖民主义和帝国主义的经验。
    他还说，帝国主义把非洲看成是他们最后的一个据点。由于他们已经失去亚洲，非洲对于他们已经变得更加重要了。他们认为亚非团结对他们是一个巨大的危险。他们由于万隆会议、开罗会议和上次阿克拉会议而感到担忧。他们由于这次会议而感到担忧，他们将继续担忧，直到殖民主义和帝国主义的末日的到来。
    他说：“我们需要团结和配合，特别是谅解，以解决非洲的巨大问题。”
    加拉勒称赞几内亚和加纳的联合，他认为这是全非洲团结的先驱。
    在今天上午会议上阿尔及利亚代表发言以后，会议主席姆博亚（怯尼亚）作了简短的发言。
    他说，阿尔及利亚的问题表明西方政策已告破产。西方国家把武器供给法国，让法国用来镇压阿尔及利亚人民。
    他还说，在非洲人民的斗争中，究竟要使用武力还是和平手段，那取决于西方国家的态度。
    然而，姆博亚劝告西方国家用所谓“积极民主”来对付他所说的
  “国际共产主义”。
    在这以前，姆博亚在昨天下午的会议上发言，主张非洲“有完全的独立和中立”。他反对在非洲建立军事基地。他在发言中对法国和英国的政策进行了批评，同时对美国表示了赞扬。
    在今天上午会议上发言的还有塞内加尔、几内亚、埃塞俄比亚、南非、利比里亚的代表。
    塞内加尔代表阿卜杜勒·里说，尽管法国制造虚伪的公民投票，塞内加尔要求立即独立。
    他还代表他的代表团提出了一个决议草案。这个草案说，会议应该要求法国政府立即承认法国海外领土的独立，并且协助黑非洲制宪议会的迅速召开，以组成新的联邦国家。
    上午会议在利比里亚代表发言以后休会。
    据新华社阿克拉8日电  在今天的全非人民大会上，恩克鲁玛发言后，刚从伦敦到达的大会主席姆博亚（怯尼亚）向大会逐一介绍了各个代表团，其中英勇的阿尔及利亚代表团和新近独立的几内亚代表团博得了热烈的掌声。姆博亚然后发表简短的讲话说，两亿非洲人异口同声、万众一心，只为了一个目的，那就是自由。现在是实现他们长期怀抱的理想的时候了。
    大会上，在宣读苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫、中国总理周恩来和朝鲜首相金日成的贺电时，代表们热烈鼓掌。大会还宣读了亚非各国、保加利亚、民主德国、世界和平理事会以及像保罗·罗伯逊和杜波依斯等著名人士的贺电。大会还宣读了英国驻加纳总督和美国的贺电。
    在开幕式上，来自二十五个国家的五十个组织的二百名代表和大批观察员以及新闻记者挤满了会议大厅。主席台后面的墙上挂着一张画，上面画着黄色的地球，地球的中心是红色火炬之下的黑非洲。上面写着：“不许干涉非洲，非洲必须自由。”对面墙上挂的一幅画画的是一个非洲人粉碎了他身上的枷锁。下面写着：“非洲各国人民团结起来”，“我们要获得自由和尊严”。（附图片）
