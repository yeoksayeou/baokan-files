Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are breaking with convention and vigorously carrying out winter afforestation by digging into the frozen soil in the severe cold and snow. As of the 8th, the region had completed over 1,233,000 mu of winter afforestation in eighteen days. Currently, leagues, banners, and counties are further arranging labor, organizing field corps, stepping up the preparation of seedlings, and imparting winter afforestation experience and technology, setting off a larger-scale winter afforestation upsurge.

The climate in Inner Mongolia is severely cold, with winter minimum temperatures generally around minus 30 degrees Celsius. In the past, there was never a habit of winter afforestation. The area requiring greening in the entire autonomous region is more than 800 million mu. According to the previous afforestation progress, it would take more than 70 years to achieve full greening. Therefore, carrying out winter afforestation to make afforestation perennial is an important issue.

In this year's winter afforestation campaign, Inner Mongolia promoted the experience of Kailu County in the Jirem League. This county took the lead in piloting winter afforestation last year, and the effect was very good, creating experience for winter afforestation in the cold regions of the north. The experience of Kailu County proves that afforestation is not only possible in areas around minus 30 degrees Celsius, but also has many favorable conditions. For example, tree sap stops flowing in winter, evaporation is low, and the survival rate of afforestation is relatively high; the cold climate can maintain moisture, and the cut of the sapling is not prone to disease and rot. In winter afforestation, the people of all ethnic groups in Kailu County also explored more than a dozen operating techniques for digging frozen soil for tree planting. Because the ground is frozen in winter, digging pits for afforestation is a strenuous task. They organized strong people to swing picks and chose sandy soil on sunny slopes to dig pits. For hard ground, they used dry, unfrozen loose soil from the nearby ground to cultivate the seedling roots, watering each layer of soil as they cultivated, combining watering and soil placement. When the water and soil froze, they promptly covered a layer of fine soil to maintain moisture. After planting the saplings, they piled the exposed part of the saplings into earthen mounds to prevent wind and freezing. Last winter, the county built 1,515 mu of house-side forests, village-side forests, and road-protection forests. Whether direct seeding, cutting propagation, or seedling planting, the survival rate was generally above 90%.

The scale of Inner Mongolia's afforestation campaign this year is particularly large, with more than three million people of all ethnic groups participating in the autumn afforestation campaign, averaging one out of every three people in the entire autonomous region involved in this battle. Many communes with afforestation areas ranging from 10,000 mu to 150,000 mu have emerged throughout the region. Because of the emphasis on solving technical problems in afforestation, the survival rate of trees is generally above 80%. As of December 8, the region has overfulfilled the annual afforestation plan by more than threefold, more than doubling the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    严寒地区冬季能造林
    内蒙古开展植树造林活动
    新华社呼和浩特讯  内蒙古自治区各族人民打破常规，在风雪严寒中挖开冻土层，大力进行冬季造林。到8日止，全区在十八天中已完成冬季造林一百二十三万三千多亩。目前，各盟旗县正在进一步安排劳动力，组织野战兵团，加紧准备种苗，传授冬季造林经验和技术，掀起更大规模的冬季造林高潮。
    内蒙古地区气候严寒，冬季最低温度一般在摄氏零下三十度左右，过去从来没有冬季造林习惯。全自治区需要绿化的面积有八亿多亩，按照过去的造林进度，要实现全面绿化须在七十多年以后，因而开展冬季造林，使造林变成常年化，是个重要问题。
    内蒙古在今年的冬季造林运动中，推广了哲里木盟开鲁县的经验。这个县在去年首先试办冬季造林，效果很好，为北方寒冷地区冬季造林创造了经验。开鲁县的经验证明，在摄氏零下三十度左右的地区不但可以造林，并且具备着许多有利条件。如树津在冬季停止流动，蒸发少，造林成活率比较高；气候寒冷可以保持水分，树苗切断处不易病腐等。开鲁县各族人民在冬季造林中，还摸索出十几项挖冻土层植树造林的操作技术。冬季地冻，造林刨坑是个吃力活，他们就组织身强力壮的人抡镐，选择沙性土壤在向阳坡刨坑。对于硬地，就用附近地面干燥未冻的碎土培苗根，每培一层土浇一层水，投水和投土结合着进行，在水土冻结的时候，及时复盖一层细土，以保持水分。栽完树苗后，把树苗上边露出的部分用土培成土包，预防风吹苗冻。去年冬天，全县营造了一千五百一十五亩宅旁林、村旁林和护路林，不论是直播、插杆和植苗，成活率一般在90％以上。
    内蒙古今年造林运动规模特别大，有三百多万各族人民参加了秋季造林运动，平均全自治区每三个人中有一人投入这个战斗。各地涌现出不少造林一万亩到十五万亩的公社。由于重视解决造林技术问题，树木成活率一般都在80％以上。到12月8日，全区已超额三倍多完成全年造林计划，比第一个五年计划期间的造林总面积多出一倍以上。
