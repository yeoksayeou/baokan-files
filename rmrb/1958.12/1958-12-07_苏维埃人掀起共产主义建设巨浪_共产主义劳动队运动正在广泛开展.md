    Soviets Launch a Great Wave of Communist Construction
    Communist Labor Team Movement is Widely Developing
    (Our Moscow Correspondent, December 5th) Comrade Prokhorov, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, recently met with our reporter and discussed the Communist Labor Team movement that is currently developing widely throughout the Soviet Union. He said that the movement to establish Communist Labor Teams, which is now widespread throughout the Soviet Union, is a spontaneous movement of the masses and a sign of the further development and enhancement of the Soviet working people's political thought and patriotic spirit. It marks a new and higher stage in the development of the spiritual outlook of the Soviet working people. The establishment and further development of Communist Labor Teams have created a reliable foundation for accelerating the completion of the new seven-year plan and striving to surpass the most developed capitalist countries in a shorter period.
    Prokhorov said that the Communist Labor Team differs from the socialist competition of the past. In the past stages of socialist construction, the Soviet working people found their own ways to accelerate the development of productive forces. For example, during the construction period of the first five-year plan, the Soviet working people organized production shock brigades, launched the Stakhanovite movement before the Patriotic War, and organized support-the-front work teams during the Patriotic War. Now, in the stage of moving towards communism, Communist Labor Teams have been organized. The tasks put forward by socialist labor competitions in the past mostly focused on completing production plans, improving product quality, reducing costs, complying with labor discipline, and leveraging production potential. However, the current Communist Labor Teams, in addition to doubling the above-mentioned production tasks, also require the comprehensive development of team members, that is, not only good production but also acting completely in accordance with the spirit of communism in work, study, and life, that is, requiring the complete elimination of some remaining capitalist ideological remnants in people's minds and conforming completely to the requirements of the communist construction stage in terms of moral character. Therefore, the widespread establishment of Communist Labor Teams is a new leap forward in the general improvement of the communist ideological consciousness of the Soviet working people.
    Prokhorov said that the movement is still in its initial stage. However, it can be clearly seen that an unprecedented high tide of communist construction is about to be set off throughout the Soviet Union. Currently, there are 1,500 Communist Labor Teams in the Moscow region alone, and Moscow city has far more than that. Now, in all economic regions and factories and enterprises throughout the Soviet Union, this movement is still being widely carried out. Prokhorov concluded by saying that the All-Union Federation of Trade Unions will use all means and strength to support the development of this movement, to further use various forms and conditions to elaborate on the significance and role of this movement in the communist construction stage, to promptly summarize the experience of establishing Communist Labor Teams in various places and promote it, and to use all means to enable the Communist Labor Teams established in various places to better shoulder their obligations.

    苏维埃人掀起共产主义建设巨浪
    共产主义劳动队运动正在广泛开展
    本报莫斯科5日电  日前全苏工会中央理事会书记处书记普罗汗洛夫接见了本报记者，他就目前全苏各地正在广泛开展的共产主义劳动工作队运动与记者作了交谈。他说，现在全苏各地普遍开展的建立共产主义劳动工作队的运动，是群众自发的运动，是苏联劳动人民政治思想和爱国主义精神进一步发展和提高的标志。它标志着苏联劳动人民的精神面貌正向着一个新的更高的阶段发展。共产主义劳动工作队的建立和它的进一步发展，为加速完成新的七年计划，争取在更短的期间超过世界最发达的资本主义国家，创造了可靠的基础。
    普罗汗洛夫说，共产主义劳动工作队与过去的社会主义竞赛有着不同的特点。在过去社会主义建设的各阶段，苏联劳动人民都寻找到自己加速发展生产力的方法。如在第一个五年计划建设时期，苏联劳动人民组织了生产突击队，在卫国战争以前发动了斯达哈诺夫运动，在卫国战争时期组织了支前工作队。而现在，在向共产主义迈进的阶段，则组织了共产主义劳动工作队。过去社会主义劳动竞赛提出的任务，大半偏重在完成生产计划、提高产品质量、降低成本、遵守劳动纪律、发挥生产潜力等方面，而现在的共产主义劳动工作队，除加倍完成上述的生产任务外，还要求工作队成员的全面发展，即不仅要求生产好，而且在工作、学习和生活上，都要完全按照共产主义的精神来行动，即要求完全消除留在人们思想意识中的一些资本主义思想残余，在道德品格上完全符合共产主义建设阶段的要求。因此，共产主义劳动工作队的普遍建立，是苏联劳动人民共产主义思想觉悟普遍提高的一个新的跃进。
    普罗汗洛夫说，目前这个运动还处在最初阶段。但已可以明显地看出在苏联全国即将掀起一个前所未有的共产主义建设高潮。目前仅在莫斯科州就有一千五百个共产主义劳动工作队，而莫斯科市还远不止此数。现在全苏各经济区、各工厂企业，这一运动还正在广泛开展。普罗汗洛夫最后说，全苏总工会要用一切办法和力量来支持这一运动的开展，要进一步利用各种形式和条件来阐述这一运动在共产主义建设阶段的意义和作用，及时总结各地共产主义劳动工作队建立的经验并加以推广，并用一切办法来使各地建立的共产主义劳动工作队更好地担负起自己所负担的义务。
