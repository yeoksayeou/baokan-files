    Saying Farewell to 1958
    Gao Shiqi
  The calendar on my desk has turned to the last page. 1958, you are about to bid us farewell. Although you are retreating to the stage of history, your brilliance will forever shine before our eyes. How fervently and intensely your days have been spent! Everyone was full of energy and high spirits. On the road of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, your achievements are brilliant and your victories glorious. Under the great call of the Party, you have continuously leaped forward, again and again. Your plans were completed ahead of schedule, and your predictions were victoriously realized. Grain satellites flew all over the sky, and sparks of steel bloomed everywhere. You have made great contributions to the motherland. You have brought the joy of youth to the people. Science and technology are advancing rapidly, literature and art are striving to move up, and the integration of education and productive labor has also achieved a great harvest. You have opened a new era in history. The people's commune was born, which is the most beautiful hope of the motherland and the highest ideal of the people. Looking at the international situation again, in the Middle East, and in our Taiwan Strait, imperialism has run into walls everywhere. The paper tiger cannot withstand our counterattack. The East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind, the power of the people is growing stronger, and the songs of peace, democracy, and independence resound throughout the world. 1958, you are about to say goodbye. 1959 will take your place, which will be a year of greater development and greater leaps forward. Let us hold the red flag even higher and move forward.

    送别1958年
    高士其案头日历已经翻到最后的一
  页，1958年，你就要和我们告别，你虽然退居到历史的舞台后
  面；你的光辉将永远闪耀在我们的
  眼前。你的日子过得多末热烈紧张，人人都干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，在多、快、好、省建设社会主
  义的路上，你的成绩灿烂战果辉煌。在党的伟大号召下，你不断地跃进再跃进，你的计划提前完成，你的预言胜利实现。粮食卫星满天飞舞，钢铁火花遍地开放，你为祖国立下了大功。你给人民带来了欢乐的青春。科学技术快马加鞭，文学艺术力争上游，教育和生产劳动相结合，也获得大丰收。你又开辟了历史新的纪元，人民公社诞生了，这是祖国最美丽的希望。这是人民最崇高的理想。再看一下国际形势，在中东，在我国台湾海峡，帝国主义到处碰壁，纸老虎经不起我们的回击。东风继续压倒西风，人民的力量日益强大，和平民主独立的歌声响遍全世界。1958年，你就要告别了，来接替你的是1959年，这将是更大发展更大跃进的一
  年。让我们更高地举起红旗向前。
