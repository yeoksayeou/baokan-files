    Preparing Sufficient Winter Forage for Livestock
    Shandong and Shaanxi Universally Carry Out Feed Storage Work
    (This News Agency report) With severe winter approaching, the preparation of sufficient feed to ensure the safe wintering of livestock and to meet the needs of livestock's great development has become an urgent and important task. After carefully studying and analyzing the situation in various regions, the agricultural leadership departments of Shandong Province have taken forceful measures to vigorously grasp the feed storage work, so that the phenomenon of livestock "winter leanness" in previous years will no longer occur, in order to create favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year.
    Currently, the work of collecting and storing livestock feed in Shandong Province is developing from point to surface, and many regions have seen encouraging scenes. Linqing County, a county that has historically lacked grass and has suffered from severe livestock emaciation and death, started early this year, dispatching more than 40,000 people to form more than 730 specialized feed storage teams. Under the personal leadership of the county party secretary and county head, they vigorously engaged in feed production and storage. Now, the county has ensiled and dry-stored more than 430 million catties of various feeds, meeting the requirements for livestock to pass the winter fully nourished. Fourteen counties, including Ningyang and Jiao County, have also prepared the grass and feed needed by livestock until the next summer harvest. It is understood that the province has now ensiled 3.4 billion catties of feed (more than double that of last year), and together with dry-stored feed, has stored a total of more than 17.3 billion catties of livestock feed and roughage.
    However, the development of this work is uneven. Some county and commune cadres are still clueless, blindly believing that this year's crops have been harvested in abundance and that there are more various feeds produced, so there will be no problem with feed for draft animals and pigs, and therefore lack specific leadership for this work. According to investigation and reports from various regions, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry believes that the abundant harvest of crops and the great increase in feed are absolutely true. However, due to the people's communization and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, some new problems have also been brought to the livestock feed storage work. For example, the great development of industrial and agricultural production has led to a shortage of labor, and there are fewer people collecting feed than before. During the autumn sowing, production teams of various people's communes used a lot of firewood and grass for burning smoke fertilizer and setting up camps; now, draft animals are fed together, and pigs are raised publicly, all managed by the commune, which requires special personnel to manage and collect feed. If these new problems are not fully estimated, they will cause passivity in the work. Some areas have insufficient understanding of this new situation, and the leadership only stays at the level of holding meetings and making arrangements, without doing systematic organizational work and conducting in-depth inspections, resulting in some communes leaving straw in the fields without anyone collecting it, even causing it to rot. As a result, crops are harvested in abundance, but feed is not abundant, and livestock will still lack two or three months of feed until the next summer harvest. There are about 20% of such counties in the province. Even in general counties (accounting for about 50%), the preparation of livestock feed is not sufficient, and it is estimated that there is still a shortage of one or two months. If the feed required for the development of livestock this winter and next spring is added, the shortage will be even greater.
    In order to quickly do a good job in feed storage and ensure that livestock are fat and strong and safe for the winter, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has taken four more measures to make the experience of advanced regions blossom everywhere: (1) While vigorously engaging in industrial and agricultural production, organizations at all levels should conduct a general inspection of feed storage in accordance with the livestock development plan. If the preparation is insufficient, effective measures should be taken to remedy it. All the materials that can be used as feed scattered in the fields and yards should be immediately organized and stored. (2) Vigorously promote fermentation, turning into distiller's grains, alkalization, steaming and boiling of feed, and domestically produced feed-grade chlortetracycline. All regions should seize the opportunity to quickly teach the production techniques to the communes. (3) When formulating agricultural production plans for next year, all counties and communes must include the establishment of feed bases and the production of feed in the entire plan. (4) While strengthening the feed storage work, all regions should conduct an inspection and repair of the pens for draft animals, pigs, etc.  (Cao Xuepu)
    Xinhua News Agency reported that Shaanxi Province mobilized commune members and keepers to take various measures to ensure that livestock safely overwinter. Twelve counties, including Lintong, have repaired and added more than 57,000 livestock sheds, and each animal has stored enough two to three thousand catties of feed and a large amount of dry soil for bedding.
    This year, the burden of livestock use in various regions has been heavier, and some places have seen livestock emaciation. A few farmers mistakenly believe that "mechanization will soon be realized, there are more tractors, and livestock are less useful." Therefore, they do not cherish the use of livestock so much, and the work of livestock feeding management is not done well enough. In response to this situation, the county party committees and people's commune party committees in various regions held meetings of keepers, epidemic prevention personnel, or commune members by commune or brigade to educate the commune members on loving and protecting livestock. Lintong County launched a special debate throughout the county on "Why are livestock weak and can they be saved?" and "How big is the use of livestock in the present and in the future?" After the debates in the Huaqing and Dongfeng People's Communes, the commune members realized that ensuring the recovery of livestock and their strong physique is closely related to ensuring a great agricultural harvest next year; livestock are still the main driving force of agricultural production in the current and future periods. Therefore, commune members raced to offer advice, and the county's leading organs summarized the opinions of the vast commune members into twelve responsibilities for the safe wintering of livestock and distributed them to all production brigades in the county. Each commune established a livestock protection committee to specifically lead this work. In a very short period of time, the county prepared more than 25 million catties of green feed for livestock, and repaired and added more than 6,000 fences.

    为牲畜准备充足的过冬粮草
    山东陕西普遍开展收贮饲料工作
    本报讯  目前严冬将至，如何准备下充足的饲草饲料，保证牲畜安全过冬和满足牲畜大发展的需要，已成为迫不及待的一项重要工作。山东省农业领导部门在细致地研究分析了各地情况以后，已采取有力措施，大抓饲草饲料贮备工作，要使历年来牲畜“冬瘦”的现象不再发生，以便为明年农业更大跃进创造良好的条件。
    现在，山东省牲畜饲草饲料的收集贮备工作，正由点到面的发展着，许多地区已经出现了可喜的景象。临清县这个历来缺草较多，牲畜瘦弱死亡现象比较严重的县份，今年及早动手，抽出四万多人组成了七百三十多个饲草贮备专业队，在县委书记、县长亲自领导下，大搞饲草饲料，现在这个县已经青贮和干藏了各种饲草四亿三千多万斤，达到了草料足牲畜满膘过冬的要求。宁阳、胶县等十四个县，到明年夏收牲畜所需的草料也储备好了。据了解，现在全省已青贮饲草三十四亿斤（较去年增加两倍多），连同干藏的共储备牲畜饲草和粗饲料一百七十三亿多斤。
    但是这项工作的开展是不平衡的，有的县、社干部还心中无数，盲目的认为今年农作物丰收了、生产的各种饲草多了，耕畜、生猪草料没有问题了，因而缺乏对这一工作的具体领导。省农林厅根据调查和各地汇报，认为农作物丰收，草料大增，是千真万确的。但是由于人民公社化和工农业大跃进的形势，也给牲畜饲草饲料贮备工作带来一些新问题。例如工农业生产大发展出现劳力紧张，收集饲草的人比以前少了，秋种时，各人民公社生产队烧烟熏肥和安营扎寨用去了许多柴草；现在耕畜合槽、生猪公养一切都由公社里办，需要专人管理和收集饲草饲料。这些新的问题如不予以充分的估计，将会造成工作上的被动。有些地区对这个新情况认识不足，领导上只停留在开会布置，没有作系统的组织工作和进行深入检查，致使有的公社秸草放在地里无人收拾。甚至发生霉烂，结果是农作物丰收而饲草不丰收，牲畜到明年夏收还缺两、三个月没有喂的。这样的县在全省就有20％左右。就是一般的县（约占50％左右）牲畜饲草饲料准备也不充分，估计还缺一、两个月，如果再加上今冬明春牲畜发展所需的草料，则缺的更多。
    为了很快作好收贮饲料工作，确保牲畜肥壮，安全过冬，省农林厅又采取了四项措施，使先进地区的经验遍地开花：（一）各级组织在大搞工农业生产的同时，按照牲畜发展规划对饲草饲料贮备普遍进行一次检查，准备不足的，要采取有效措施补救。对能用作饲料的散放在田间、场间的，要立即组织一定力量全部收集贮存起来。（二）大力推广发酵、变糟、碱化、蒸煮饲料和土制饲用金霉素。各地要抓紧时机，把制做技术迅速教给公社。（三）各县、社在制订明年农业生产计划时，都必须把建立饲料基地，生产饲草饲料列入整个计划以内。（四）在加强饲草饲料贮备工作的同时，各地要对耕畜、生猪等栏圈进行一次检查和修补。  （曹学璞）
    据新华社讯  陕西省发动公社社员、饲养员采取各种措施，保证牲畜安全过冬。临潼等十二个县已为牲畜修补和增添圈棚五万七千多间，每头牲畜都贮足了两、三千斤饲料和大量的垫圈干土。
    今年各地牲畜使役负担都较繁重，有些地方牲畜产生瘦弱的现象。少数农民错误的认为“快实现机械化了，拖拉机多了，牲畜用处小了”。因此对使用牲畜不太爱惜，牲畜饲养管理工作也作得不够好。各地县委和人民公社党委针对这一情况，以公社或大队为单位分别召开了饲养员、防疫员或社员会议，向社员进行爱畜保畜的教育。临潼县在全县开展了“牲畜为什么乏瘦，能不能挽救”、“牲畜在当前和今后的用处大小”等专题辩论。华清、东风等人民公社经过辩论后，使社员们认识到保证牲畜复膘体壮对于保证明年农业大丰收有密切关系；牲畜在当前和今后相当时期内仍然是农业生产的主要动力。因此社员们争先献计献策，县的领导机关把广大社员提的意见归纳为牲畜安全过冬十二条责任制，发到全县各生产大队，各公社都成立了爱畜保畜委员会，具体领导这一工作。在很短时间内全县即为牲畜贮备青饲料两千五百多万斤，修补和增添栅圈六千多间。
