    Wang Baojing Leads the Fenghuo Cooperative in a Great Technical Revolution
    Anyone who has visited the Fenghuo Cooperative in Liquan, Shaanxi, and seen the experimental fields for high yield, experiments, varieties, and cultivation comparisons, will feel that the fields of the Fenghuo Cooperative are a battlefield for the Great Leap Forward in Production, and also a classroom for the Great Leap Forward in Science, inspiring excitement everywhere.
    The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative, led by Wang Baojing, was originally a small cooperative. This year, it merged with thirty-eight smaller cooperatives to form the Fenghuo People's Commune.
  Everyone Learns Science, the Whole Cooperative Conducts Experiments
    Since 1952, under the cultivation of the Party, Wang Baojing has vigorously engaged in high-yield experiments and scientific research. Under Wang Baojing's leadership, the cooperative currently has about 110 mu of land for experimentation, with 137 participants and 104 experimental projects. There is a primitive material nursery, a hybrid breeding nursery, satellite experimental fields, as well as "Ten Women's High-Yield Fields," and "Old Man and Wife Experimental Fields," truly a case of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique abilities."
    The technical innovation movement of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative has been constantly expanding and improving along with the cooperativization movement. According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of the corn experiment in the mutual aid group to the present, over the past seven years, a total of 162 experimental projects have been carried out. As the number of experimental projects increases, the quality also progresses from low to high, from simple to complex. In particular, different comparative experiments have been conducted on corn varieties, sowing, fertilization, and cultivation, mastering the eight major yield-increasing measures for corn cultivation: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, labor, and management. In order to continuously innovate technology, Comrade Wang Baojing began hybrid breeding experiments in 1955. After three years of dedicated research, 112 varieties of wheat, 32 varieties of cotton, and 13 varieties of corn have been experimentally planted. Through sexual and asexual hybridization methods, cotton varieties such as "Fenghuo Selection No. 1" and "Fenghuo Selection No. 3," and new wheat varieties such as "Fenghuo Selection No. 1" and "Fenghuo Selection No. 2" have been selected. Corn varieties such as "1504" and "1506" have also been cultivated, among which "1506" has been widely planted throughout the cooperative, increasing production by more than 20%. At the same time, distant hybridization of different genera such as wheat and corn has also been carried out, resulting in new grain varieties. These facts prove that farmers can not only master science and technology, but also use their wisdom to create and develop science.
    Due to the implementation of science and technology, the yield of the Fenghuo Cooperative has increased year by year, transforming it from a consistently grain-deficient cooperative to a surplus cooperative. The income of cooperative members has also increased year by year. In 1956, the average income per person in the cooperative was 140 yuan, and the living and income levels far exceeded the level of local well-to-do middle peasants before cooperativization. This year, another unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved, with an average yield per mu exceeding the bumper harvest of 1956 by 53.6%.
    How to Carry Out Scientific Research Work
    First, scientific research is closely integrated with production, promoting production, and in turn promoting the development of scientific research. For example, in the initial stage, the focus was on conducting high-yield cultivation experiments, creating experience on a small area to promote large-scale production, and breaking the conservative idea that "production has reached its peak," so that production can continue to develop and move forward.
    Second, importance is attached to the popularization of science and technology, and gradually improved. To universally promote science and technology, it must be mastered by the masses. Therefore, the cooperative established a technical night school, with the cooperative's technicians serving as teachers. According to the needs of the production process, students learn what they do, and adopt the principle of learning and doing at the same time, so that scientific and technological learning is closely integrated with production. Through such continuous learning, now 75% of male cooperative members and 45% of female cooperative members have learned the technical knowledge of cotton seed selection, pest control, pruning; corn deep plowing and fertilization, emasculation hybridization and artificial pollination. In addition to the mass technical night school, a technical school for cadres was also established. Teachers from the Northwest Agricultural College were invited to teach basic agricultural courses such as soil and fertilizer, cultivation, plant protection, seed selection, and crop cultivation, which played a significant role in rapidly improving the scientific and technical level of cadres and the masses.
    Third, scientific research institutions are established to strengthen cooperative relations with relevant research institutions, ensuring the development of science and technology organizationally. As early as 1955, the Fenghuo Cooperative established a technical cooperation relationship with the Northwest Agricultural College. This year, a contract was signed to help the cooperative learn and promote science and technology in all aspects. In addition, the cooperative has also established contact with units such as the Northwest Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In order to adapt to the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture and the technical revolution, in May of this year, the cooperative established the first agricultural science research office in the province.
        Three Points of Experience
    The experience of the Fenghuo Cooperative shows that in all undertakings, the leadership of the Party is the decisive factor. In recent years, whenever Comrade Wang Baojing encountered difficulties and setbacks in scientific research, the Party extended a helping hand. Whenever Comrade Wang Baojing and the cooperative cadres had some achievements in production or scientific research and developed complacency and detachment from the masses, the Party promptly pointed it out and provided positive enlightenment and education, enabling them to continuously advance in the development of the cooperative's cause. Therefore, Comrade Wang Baojing often said with great emotion: "Without the Party, there would be no Wang Baojing. I will always listen to the Party and always follow the Party."
    The experience of the Fenghuo Cooperative also shows that breaking the mystical concept of science and advocating a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act is an important key to promoting the development of scientific undertakings. When Comrade Wang Baojing conducted the high-yield experiment of 1,200 jin per mu of corn in 1952, many people ridiculed Wang Baojing, calling Comrade Wang Baojing "One Thousand Two." However, under the care and encouragement of the Party, Comrade Wang Baojing strengthened his confidence and finally exceeded the target of 1,200 jin in the second year. When the cooperative vigorously carried out hybrid breeding experiments, it was also suspected by agricultural experts and cadres. However, Comrade Wang Baojing did not waver because of this, firmly believing that "increased production is the direction" and "the ability to select new varieties is the basis." At the same time, with the encouragement and support of Secretary Zhang of the Provincial Party Committee, the confidence of the Fenghuo Cooperative in vigorously engaging in experimental research was strengthened, thereby leading to today's scientific research achievements in the cooperative.
    The experience of the Fenghuo Cooperative also shows that mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses is the foundation for doing all work well, and scientific research is no exception. In the past, experimental research in the cooperative was carried out by a few technical backbones led by Wang Baojing. Due to the small number of people and limited strength, in experimental research, they often neglected one thing or another. Since the establishment of the technical night school, the cooperative has put forward the slogan "Everyone learns technology, everyone tackles science, every team conducts experiments, and every household achieves high yield." The number of male and female cooperative members participating in experiments accounts for 40% of all cooperative members. We believe that the spark of the technological revolution that has already formed will shine brightly in the Fenghuo Cooperative.

    王保京领导烽火社大闹技术革命
    凡是到陕西醴泉烽火社参观过的人，看到了那些丰产、试验、品种、耕作对照等试验田块，都会感到烽火社的田野是一个生产大跃进的战场，也是一个科学大跃进的课堂，处处动人心弦。
    以王保京为首领导的烽火农业社，原是一个小社。今年由三十八个小社合并组成烽火人民公社。
  人人学科学  全社搞试验
    王保京从1952年起，在党的培养下，大搞丰产试验，大搞科学研究。在王保京的领导下，目前全社试验研究占地约一百一十亩，参加研究的有一百三十七人，试验项目有一百零四个。有原始材料圃，有杂交育种圃，有卫星试验田，也有十女丰产田，老汉老婆试验田，真所谓“八仙过海，各显神通”。
    烽火农业社的技术革新运动，是随着合作化运动，不断扩展，不断提高的。根据不完全统计，从互助组开始搞玉米试验起，到现在七年来的时间，共作了一百六十二个试验项目。随着各种试验项目的增多，在质量上也是由低级到高级，由简到繁。特别是对玉米的品种、播种、施肥、耕作等方面进行不同的对比试验，掌握了玉米栽培方面的水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管等八大增产措施。为了不断革新技术，王保京同志从1955年开始进行杂交育种试验。经过三年的苦心钻研，已经试验种植的小麦品种有一百一十二种，棉花三十二种，玉米十三种，并采取有性、无性杂交的方法，选育出“烽选一号”、“烽选三号”等棉花品种和“烽选一号”、
  “烽选二号”等小麦新品种，还培育出“1504号”、“1506号”玉米良种，其中“1506号”已在全社普遍种植，增产在20％以上。同时，还进行了小麦和玉米等不同属的远缘杂交，得出了新的谷物品种。这些事实证明，农民不仅可以掌握科学技术，而且还能用自己的智慧创造科学，发展科学。
    由于科学技术的贯彻，烽火社的产量逐年增加，由一贯的缺粮社变为余粮社。社员收入也逐年增加，全社1956年每人平均收入一百四十元，生活和收入水平都远远超过当地富裕中农在合作化以前的水平。今年又获得自古未有的大丰收，平均亩产超过大丰收的1956年的53.6％。
    怎样开展科学研究工作
    首先是以科学研究密切结合生产，推动生产，又反过来推动科学研究的开展。如初期阶段以搞丰产栽培试验为主，在小面积上创造经验，以推动大面积的生产，并打破“生产到顶”的保守思想，使生产不断开展和不断前进。
    其次是重视科学技术的普及工作，并逐步提高。要把科学技术普遍的推广开来，必须使科学技术为群众所掌握。因此，该社成立了技术夜校，由本社的技术员担任教员，根据生产环节的需要，做啥学啥，和边学边干的方针，使科学技术学习和生产紧密的结合起来。经过这样的不断学习，现在全社75％的男社员和45％的女社员都学会了棉花的精选种子、防虫、整枝；玉米的深耕施肥、去雄杂交和人工辅助授粉等技术知识。除群众性的技术夜校外，还成立了干部的技术学校。聘请西北农学院下放的教师任课，开设土壤肥料、耕作、植物保护、选种和作物栽培等农业基础课程，这对于迅速提高干部和群众的科学技术水平起了很大的作用。
    第三是建立科学研究机构，加强和各有关研究机关的协作关系，从组织上保证科学技术的发展。早在1955年烽火社就与西北农学院建立了技术协作关系，今年又签了合同，从各方面帮助该社学习并推广科学技术。此外，该社还与中国科学院西北生物研究所等单位取得联系。为了适应农业大跃进和技术革命的高潮，本年5月，该社成立了全省第一个农业科学研究室。
        三点经验
    烽火社的经验表明：在一切事业中，党的领导是决定的因素。几年来，每当王保京同志在搞科学研究中遇到困难和挫折时，党就伸手予以援助。每当王保京同志和社干部们在生产上或在科学研究上有一些成绩而产生骄傲自满情绪和脱离群众时，党就及时的指出并予以正面启发教育，使他们在社的事业发展过程中不断前进。因此，王保京同志经常非常感动的说：“没有党，就没有王保京，我永远听党的话，永远跟着党走”。
    烽火社的经验还表明：破除对科学的神秘观念，提倡敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，是推动科学事业发展的重要关键。当王保京同志1952年进行玉米亩产一千二百斤的丰产试验时，许多人对王保京采取讽刺嘲笑的态度，把王保京同志称为“一千二”。但是，王保京同志在党的关怀和鼓舞下，坚定了信心，终于在第二年超额完成了一千二百斤的指标。在社里大搞杂交育种试验时，也曾受到农业专家和干部们的怀疑，但是，王保京同志并不为此有所动摇，坚信“能增产就是方向”和“能选出了新品种就是根据”。同时，在省委张书记的鼓励和支持下，坚定了烽火社大搞试验研究的信心，从而在社里才有了今日的科学研究成绩。
    烽火社的经验又表明：发动群众依靠群众是做好一切工作的基础，科学研究也不能例外。过去在社里搞试验研究是以王保京为首的几个技术骨干分子，由于人少力量小，在试验研究方面，常常顾此失彼。自从办起技术夜校，社里提出了“人人学技术，个个攻科学，队队搞试验，户户有丰产”的号召后，参加搞试验的男女社员占全体社员的40％。我们相信，已经形成的技术革命的火花，将在烽火社大放光彩。（本文根据全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议材料改编）
