Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 21st: "Xinjiang Red Flag," a semi-monthly theoretical journal sponsored by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee, was inaugurated and distributed on the 20th of this month in Chinese, Uyghur, and Kazakh languages.

The inaugural issue of "Xinjiang Red Flag" features articles by Saifudin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Zeng Di. In his article entitled "Great Achievements, Profound Education," Saifudin discusses the enormous gains made by the autonomous region's mass movement for large-scale iron and steel production in the political, economic, and other spheres. In his article entitled "Continue to Vigorously Grasp Iron and Steel," Zeng Di calls on Party committees at all levels to unswervingly rely on the masses, take steel as the key link, launch a large-scale mass movement, and overfulfill next year's iron and steel production and construction tasks.
