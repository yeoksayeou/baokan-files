Xinhua News Agency, 30th. In 1958, along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, crèches and kindergartens, which are closely related to the vital interests of the broad masses of women, have also been greatly developed in various places. According to incomplete statistics, since the busy summer and autumn seasons, the number of children in kindergartens in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country has increased from 1.09 million last year to about 25 million. As of August, there were more than 3.01 million nurseries (nursery stations, teams, and institutions) established in rural areas alone, accommodating more than 24 million children. After the realization of people's communes in rural areas, more favorable conditions have been provided in terms of manpower and material resources for the development of crèches and kindergartens. Throughout the country, from the interior to the border areas, from the plains to the mountains, wherever there are communes and settlements, there are paradises for children. In the communes, generally every production team has crèches and kindergartens. In some areas, the proportion of children attending crèches and kindergartens accounts for about 85% of the total number of pre-school children, and in some areas it exceeds 90%.

The crèches and kindergartens established in various places are seasonal, permanent, fixed, day-care, and full-time day and night care. Generally, they develop from small to large, and from temporary and seasonal to permanent and fixed. Most of these crèches and kindergartens have gradually stabilized from the beginning without experience, and most of them are well-run. In the kindergarten of the Maicheng People's Commune in Qianwei County, Sichuan Province, more than 30 children originally suffered from indigestion (big bellies) and impetigo at home. After entering the kindergarten for two months, they were cured, and their weight increased. The Yuqun Nursery in Beijing has not had any infectious diseases for two years due to its attention to prevention work. While paying attention to the physical health of children, the crèches and kindergartens in various places also compile songs and tell stories for children in conjunction with the Party's central tasks, and carry out political and moral education, so that children can develop healthily in both body and mind.

The rapid development of crèches and kindergartens in our country fully reflects the superiority of the socialist system and the people's communes. Before liberation, women in our country were subjected to heavy political and economic oppression. There were never any crèches or kindergartens in the countryside. Although there were some in the cities, they were only decorations, and it was difficult for the children of ordinary working people to enter. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the number of children attending crèches and kindergartens was no more than 130,000 in the peak year. Since liberation, women have been liberated, and their political and economic status has changed. They have abundant enthusiasm for participating in social labor. The large-scale establishment of crèches and kindergartens has enabled the broad masses of women to take up industrial and agricultural production and other jobs, and is deeply welcomed by the masses of women. After Heilongjiang Province established a large number of crèches and kindergartens this year, the number of women participating in summer hoeing increased by about 500,000 compared with 1957. In Tianyang, Sanjiang and other places in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, some women used to lock their children at home or carry them on their backs when they went to the fields. Now, because there are crèches and kindergartens, they no longer have to do this, and a new atmosphere of "every child is taken care of, and every mother is engaged in production" has emerged. Children are well-nourished and well-educated in crèches and kindergartens, and mothers go to work in production without any worries. Some people praise this situation as: children are happy, and mothers are at ease!

An extremely important issue in developing and consolidating crèches and kindergartens is to accelerate the training of a contingent of nursery staff and educators who are both red and expert, to take good care of children and educate them well. Various localities have already taken various specific measures to carry out this work, selecting working women with good backgrounds and good ideology to serve as nursery staff and educators. And they have adopted short-term rotation training, sent experienced nursery staff to the site for guidance, and improved the professional level of nursery staff and educators through on-site meetings and visits. For long-term planning, many places have also opened early childhood education training classes and early childhood normal schools for systematic training. According to incomplete statistics from six special districts in Sichuan Province alone, more than 110,000 people have been trained by November.

The rapid development of crèches and kindergartens is a new thing that has never happened before in many places, and it is also a major event related to the interests of the broad masses of people. The primary condition for doing this work well is the leadership of the Party. In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, Party organizations in various localities have attached importance to this work from the beginning, carrying out propaganda and education, mobilizing the masses, and helping to establish crèches and kindergartens, and paying attention to consolidating them. In order to run the nursery well, the Party Committee of the Huergai People's Commune in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province, held six meetings and conducted many studies on the selection of nursery staff. Party organizations at all levels in Liucheng County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, strengthened their leadership over crèches and kindergartens, selected outstanding backbones from among women to take charge of the work, and continuously improved the political and professional level of nursery staff through short-term rotation training. Party organizations in various localities have also strengthened the political and ideological leadership of nursery and education staff in crèches and kindergartens to consolidate their professional thinking. Fujian, Sichuan and other provinces have carried out ideological education among nursery and education staff through representative conferences of activists in early childhood education and short-term training, and some regions have carried out debates to criticize the erroneous idea that "serving people by taking care of children is humble," and to enhance understanding and strengthen responsibility. Recently, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have further strengthened their leadership over the work of crèches and kindergartens. Shandong, Qinghai, Fujian and other provinces have held special meetings or on-site meetings to exchange experiences and study the rectification and consolidation of crèches and kindergartens. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee jointly issued instructions in November, proposing specific measures to run crèches and kindergartens well, and implementing them throughout the province. Party organizations in many regions have instructed relevant departments such as education, health, and women's federations to cooperate and mobilize all parties to do this work well.

    “娃娃开心  妈妈安心”
    幼儿教育大发展妇女生产热情高
    新华社30日讯  在1958年，随着工农业生产的大跃进，关系到广大妇女切身利益的托儿组织和幼儿园，在各地也得到巨大发展。根据不完全的统计，从夏、秋大忙季节以来，全国二十七个省、市、自治区幼儿园在园儿童由去年的一百零九万增至二千五百万左右；各地设立的托儿组织（托儿站、队、所），截至8月份单是在农村即有三百零一万多处，收托二千四百多万个儿童。农村实现人民公社化以后，在人力、物力等方面，为发展托儿组织、幼儿园提供了更为有利的条件，全国从内地到边疆，从平原到山区，哪里有公社、有居民点，哪里就有孩子们的乐园，在公社里，一般是每个生产队都有托儿组织和幼儿园。进托儿所和幼儿园的儿童，有些地区占学前儿童总数85％左右，有的超过90％。
    各地所设托儿组织、幼儿园，有季节性的，有常年固定的，有的是日托，有的是日夜全托。一般是由小到大，由临时季节性的逐步朝着常年固定的方向发展。这些托儿组织和幼儿园，由开始时没有经验逐步稳定下来，大多数是办得好的。四川省犍为县买城人民公社幼儿园，有三十多个小孩原来在家里患积食病（大肚子）和脓疮，进园两个月后都治好了病，体重都增加了。北京市育群托儿所由于注意预防工作，已经有两年没有发生过传染性疾病。各地的托儿组织、幼儿园在重视儿童身体健康的同时，还结合党的各项中心工作为儿童编歌曲，讲故事，进行政治品德的教育，让孩子们在身心方面都能健康地发展。
    托儿组织和幼儿园在我国突飞猛进地发展，充分体现了社会主义制度和人民公社的优越性。解放前，我国的妇女在政治上和经济上受到重重压迫，农村里从来没有什么托儿所、幼儿园，城市里虽然有一些也只是点缀品，普通劳动人们的孩子是难得进去的。在国民党反动统治时期，进托儿组织和幼儿园的儿童数，最高年限不过十三万名。解放以来，妇女翻了身，政治和经济地位改变了，她们对参加社会劳动有充沛的热情。托儿组织、幼儿园的大量举办，使广大妇女群众走上工农业生产和其他工作的岗位上，深受到妇女群众的欢迎。黑龙江省今年大办托儿组织和幼儿园以后，夏锄时妇女参加的人数比1957年增加了约五十万。广西僮族自治区田阳、三江等地，过去有些妇女下田时把孩子锁在家里或者背在身上，现在因为有了托儿组织和幼儿园，再也不要这样做了，出现了“个个娃仔有人看，个个妈妈搞生产”的新气象。孩子们在托儿所幼儿园养得好，教得好，母亲们无牵无挂地去生产，有人称赞这种情景是：孩子开心，妈妈安心！
    发展和巩固托儿组织、幼儿园中的一个极其重要问题，是要加速培养训练一支又红又专的保育员和教养员队伍，把孩子带好，教养好。各地已经采取各种具体措施进行这一工作，选拔成份好、思想好的劳动妇女，担任保育员、教养员。并且采取短期轮训、派有经验的保育人员去现场辅导、通过现场会议和参观等，来提高保育员、教养员的业务水平。为了长远打算，不少地方还开办幼儿教育训练班和幼儿师范学校，作系统的培养。仅四川省据六个专区不完全统计，到11月已训练出十一万多人。
    托儿组织、幼儿园如此迅速地发展，在许多地方是一件从来没有过的新事，又是关系到广大人民的利益的大事，做好这一工作的首要条件是党的领导。在全国工农业生产大跃进中，各地党组织一开始就重视这一工作，开展宣传教育，发动群众，帮助把托儿组织、幼儿园建立起来，并且注意巩固它。青海省刚察县哈尔盖人民公社党委为了办好托儿所，曾召开六次会议，对保育员的选择也进行过多次研究。广西僮族自治区柳城县各级党组织加强对托儿组织和幼儿园的领导，选派妇女中的优秀骨干去担任负责工作，又采取短期轮训的方式不断提高保育人员的政治和业务水平。各地党组织还对托儿所、幼儿园保育教养人员，加强政治思想领导，巩固她们的专业思想。福建、四川等省分别通过幼儿教育积极分子代表大会和短期训练等形式，在保育、教养人员中开展思想教育工作，有的地区开展辩论，批判“带孩子侍候人卑下”的错误思想，提高认识，加强责任感。最近，各省、市、自治区进一步加强对托儿所、幼儿园工作的领导，山东、青海、福建等省分别召开了专门的会议或现场会议，交流经验，研究整顿、巩固托儿组织和幼儿园。中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会11月间联合发布指示，提出办好托儿所幼儿园的各项具体措施，在全省各地贯彻。许多地区的党组织，责成教育、卫生、妇联等有关部门进行协作，动员各方面力量搞好这一工作。（附图片）
