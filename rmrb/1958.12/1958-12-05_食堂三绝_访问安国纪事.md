    Three Wonders of the Mess Hall
    ——Chronicle of a Visit to Anguo
    Tian Han

    Seven women can cook rice for a thousand households, one chimney truly emits smoke for ten thousand families;
    Sweet potatoes as big as dippers, steamed buns so stout, from now on, no more money needed for meals.
    [Note] Couplet from the Wuren Village Commune mess hall in Anguo County: "A thousand households' smoke rises from one place..."

    Tea sweet, buns soft, wine fragrant, the courtyard filled with locust shade, the walls covered in poetry.
    The scars of the hard-fought battles in the Central Plains remain, yet there is still heroic spirit in playing chess.
    [Note] The old men play chess after meals, with many others watching, the battles are intense.

    Enthusiasm drums up speed faster than a galloping horse, having experienced storms, one looks down on a whole cow.
    Round shaomai, pointy dumplings, every morning meal reminds me of Old Liu.
    [Note] Old Liu, the head cook of the county committee, is extremely concerned about the comrades' health; he participated in the revolution and has much experience.

    食堂三绝
    ——访问安国纪事
    田汉
    七妇能炊千户米，一囱真冒万家烟；
    甘薯斗大馍馍壮，吃饭从今不要钱。
    〔注〕安国县伍仁村公社食堂联语：“千户炊烟一处冒……”
    茶甘馍软酒香时，满院槐荫满壁诗。
    中原苦战疤痕在，犹有豪情对奕棋。
    〔注〕老人们饭后下棋，诸老旁观，战斗甚剧。
    干劲鼓来超快马，风波历尽藐全牛。
    圆圆烧卖尖尖饺，每对晨餐忆老刘。
    〔注〕县委伙食头老刘，极关心同志们健康，他曾参加革命，阅历甚多。
