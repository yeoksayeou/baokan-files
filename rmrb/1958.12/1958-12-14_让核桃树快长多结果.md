Let Walnut Trees Grow Faster and Produce More Fruit
Zhang Qien

The walnut is an important woody oil crop, with good oil quality and high oil content. One hundred catties of walnuts with shells can yield 25 to 35 catties of oil. Walnut trees grow in a wide range of areas in China, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Yunnan, Guizhou, Liaoning, Beijing, and other sixteen provinces, districts, and cities.

There are five major benefits to developing walnut production:

First, expanding oil sources. Shangluo Special District in Shaanxi Province has a total of 310,000 households, which completed a plan to plant one sheng of walnuts per household last winter and this spring. The Shangluo District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calculated that, assuming a survival rate of 50%, it could produce 75,000 tons of oil in ten years, greatly exceeding the current total national walnut oil production. Therefore, if all regions greatly develop walnut trees, walnut oil can meet people's needs to the greatest extent.

Second, earning foreign exchange to support national construction. China's walnut kernels have always been very popular in the international market. In 1956, 22,800 tons of walnut kernels were exported, and the demand still exceeded the supply.

Third, increasing income and improving people's lives. The masses say, "Walnut trees are money trees and silver jars." In walnut-producing areas, walnuts are an important sideline income for farmers. Shang County in Shaanxi Province has formulated a new leap forward plan after completing the task of planting one sheng of walnuts per household. The income from these walnut trees after bearing fruit will exceed the current income by dozens of times.

Fourth, conserving water and soil, and ensuring agricultural harvests. When the masses plant walnuts on hillsides, they dig fish-scale pits to store water and conserve soil to promote the growth of walnut seedlings, which is of great benefit to the farmland below the mountains.

Fifth, developing walnut production can further stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses in building mountainous areas, and further promote other production undertakings in mountainous areas. After launching the "one sheng of walnuts planted per household" campaign in Shangluo Special District of Shaanxi Province, the old idea that had restricted people for many years that "mountainous areas cannot become wealthy" was eliminated, and the entire mountainous area's production undertakings have greatly developed.

After liberation, walnut trees have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, from 1950 to 1957, a total of more than 2.45 million mu of forest were planted, equivalent to 7.5 times the original walnut trees (20 million trees) before liberation. The achievements in developing walnuts are significant. However, judging from the needs of the comprehensive leap forward of China's production undertakings and the general improvement of people's living standards for walnuts, the development of walnut production undertakings is still far from sufficient, both in terms of quantity and output. In addition, except for some areas, there are still not many newly planted young forests, and people have not given due attention to the development of walnuts. These have affected the development of walnut production to a certain extent.

In view of the above-mentioned situation, to develop walnut production, it is necessary not only to plant more walnut trees, but also to make them grow faster and bear fruit earlier; and to make the existing large trees bear more fruit. Can these requirements be realized? Facts prove that it is entirely possible. First of all, regarding planting more, in the seven counties of Shangluo Special District in Shaanxi Province, the entire special district had more than 390,000 walnut trees in 1952, and by the end of 1958, it had developed to 84 million trees, a total of 215 times increase in six years, roughly equivalent to the number of walnut trees developed by 150 counties in Hebei Province in recent years. This special district plans to develop walnut trees to 200 million trees, which shows that there is enormous potential for developing walnuts.

Some people still have superstitions about developing walnut production, believing that the growth of walnut trees is restricted by certain natural conditions and cannot be universally developed. The miracles created by the people in the Great Leap Forward shattered this conditionalism. The walnut trees planted by the Hongguang People's Commune in Shang County, Shaanxi Province, on the hillside, according to old experience, could not grow well because the soil on the hillside was thin, but this young forest grew well. What is the reason? Liu Shufan, a model forestry worker, answered this question, saying: "Dig big pits, replace with good soil, water adequately, and apply fertilizer. It will grow even if you don't want it to." In order to greatly develop walnut trees, various places have created many propagation methods, such as grafting with water-loving maple trees and walnut hickories (a type of walnut tree) that can grow in arid mountainous areas. These are already successful good methods, creating new conditions for the development of walnut production.

In many places, the walnut yield is not high due to insect pests. If the insect pests are eliminated, the yield can be increased. In northern walnut trees, there is a serious insect pest called "walnut black spot," which is quite widespread and seriously affects the walnut yield. Many large trees have no harvest year after year due to the harm of "walnut black spot." Some old farmers say that this is a natural disease and cannot be cured. But that is not the case. Beijing took the lead in eliminating "walnut black spot" and achieved good results. In 1957, the original Lingshui Agricultural Cooperative sprayed the affected walnut trees with 200 times 6% wettable "666" solution, which made trees that had not borne fruit for many years bear fruit. This year, Lingshou County in Hebei Province increased its output from 500,000 catties to 2.5 million catties, an increase of four times, due to the elimination of "walnut black spot." From this, it can be seen that as long as the "walnut black spot" insect pest is eliminated, northern walnut trees can ensure a bumper harvest. The experience of many areas proves that timely pest control, fertilization, and irrigation are the main keys to increasing production in existing walnut forests. Grasping this key, the walnut yield can be greatly increased. Paying attention to cultivation techniques, selecting and planting excellent varieties, and carrying out pruning and tending are all directly related to walnut yield increase.

We believe that as long as we boldly mobilize the masses, we can greatly develop walnut trees, and as long as we improve operation and management, we can rapidly increase production. The future of walnut production is optimistic. We should have great ambitions and lofty aspirations, not only to let the people of the whole country eat high-quality walnut oil and walnut kernels, but also to let the people of the world eat walnut oil and walnut kernels produced in China.

    让核桃树快长多结果
    张启恩
    核桃是一种重要的木本油料，油质好，含油量高，一百斤带壳的核桃，可以榨二十五到三十五斤油。核桃树在我国分布的地区很广，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆、山西、河北、山东、河南、四川、湖北、江苏、安徽、云南、贵州和辽宁、北京等十六个省、区、市都有生长。
    发展核桃生产有五大好处：
    第一，扩大油源。陕西省商雒专区共有三十一万户，在去冬今春完成了每户种一升核桃的计划。中共商雒地委算了一笔账，以成活率按50％来计算，十年后可产油七点五万吨，大大超过目前全国核桃油的总产量。因此，如果各地都大量发展核桃树，核桃油将可以最大限度满足人们的需要。
    第二，换取外汇，支援国家建设。我国的核桃仁在国际市场上素来很受欢迎。1956年出口核桃仁二万二千八百吨，还是供不应求。
    第三，增加收入，改善人民生活。群众说“核桃树是摇钱树、是银罐罐”。在核桃产区，核桃是农民的一项重要副业收入。陕西省商县在完成每户种一升核桃的任务以后，又制订了新的跃进规划。这些核桃树结实后，收入将超过现在的几十倍。
    第四，保持水土，保障农业丰收。群众在山坡上种核桃时，都挖鱼鳞坑蓄水保土，以促进核桃幼树的生长，这样作对山下的农田有很大好处。
    第五，发展核桃生产可以进一步激发广大群众建设山区的积极性和创造性，进一步推动山区的其他各项生产事业。陕西省商雒专区在开展了“每户种一升核桃”的运动以后，消除了多少年来束缚人们的“山区富不了”的旧思想，整个山区生产事业都有了很大发展。
    解放后，核桃树有很大的发展，据不完全的统计，1950—1957年共造林二百四十五万余亩，等于解放前原有核桃树（二千万株）的七点五倍，发展核桃的成绩是很大的。但是，从我国生产事业的全面大跃进和人民生活水平普遍提高以后对于核桃的需要来看，核桃生产事业的发展，不论是数量还是产量都还很不够。另外，除某些地区外，新造幼林也仍然不很多，人们对发展核桃还未能给予应有的重视。这些都在一定程度上影响了核桃生产的发展。
    针对上面所述的情况，发展核桃生产，不仅要多栽核桃树，而且要使它快长，早结果；原有的大树要使它多结果。这样要求能不能够实现呢？事实证明完全可能。首先说多栽，陕西省商雒专区七个县，1952年全专区共有核桃树三十九万多株，到1958年底发展到八千四百万株，六年间共发展了二百一十五倍，同河北省一百五十个县几年来所发展的核桃树大体相等。这个专区计划核桃树还要发展到两亿株，这说明发展核桃是有着巨大潜力的。
    有一些人对发展核桃生产还有迷信，认为核桃树的生长受一定的自然条件限制，不能普遍发展。大跃进中人民创造的奇迹打破了这种唯条件论。陕西省商县红光人民公社在山坡上栽的核桃树，按老经验，山坡土薄核桃树是长不好的，可是这片幼林却生长良好。什么原因呢？林业模范刘树蕃解答了这个问题，他说：“挖大坑、换好土、浇足水、施了肥，不让它长它偏要长。”各地为了大量发展核桃树，创造了许多繁殖方法，如利用喜水的枫杨和能在干旱山地生长的核桃楸（核桃树的一种）嫁接等。这些已经是试验成功的好办法，为发展核桃生产创造了新的条件。
    许多地方核桃产量不大是由于虫害，除治了虫害产量就可以提高。北方的核桃树有一种严重的虫害“核桃黑”，受害面相当普遍，严重影响核桃的产量，很多大树由于“核桃黑”为害，年年没有收成。一些老农都说这是天生的一种病，是没法治的。其实不然。北京市首先开始消灭“核桃黑”，成绩很好。原灵水农业社在1957年用二百倍6％可湿性“六六六”液喷射受害的核桃树，使多年不结果的树结果了。河北省灵寿县今年由于消灭了“核桃黑”，产量从五十万斤提高到二百五十万斤，增加了四倍。由此可见，只要消灭“核桃黑”虫害，北方核桃树就可以确保大丰收。很多地区的经验证明，及时除虫、进行施肥和灌水，是现有核桃成林当前增产的主要关键。抓住这个关键，核桃产量就可以大大提高。注意栽培技术，选栽优良品种和进行整枝抚育都对核桃增产有直接关系。
    我们相信，只要放手发动群众，就可以大量发展核桃树，只要改善经营管理，就可以迅速提高产量，核桃生产的前途是乐观的。我们应该树雄心，立大志，不仅要让全国人民都吃到上等的核桃油和核桃仁，而且要让世界上的人民都能吃到我国生产的核桃油和核桃仁。（附图片）
