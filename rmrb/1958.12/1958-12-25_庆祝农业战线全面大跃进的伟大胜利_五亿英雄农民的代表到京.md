Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction is scheduled to open solemnly in the capital on the 25th.

The National Agricultural Exhibition is also about to open.

The holding of the large-scale representative conference marks the great victory achieved by China's 500 million peasants in 1958 on the agricultural front, under the illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The main purpose of the conference is to celebrate this great victory, summarize the experiences of this year's Great Leap Forward, and encourage peasants across the country to continue to advance victoriously and strive for an even greater leap forward next year.

The representative conference is being held jointly with the National Patriotic Health Campaign Representative Conference. Attending are delegations from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as a delegation from the central ministries and departments directly under their control. The six thousand male and female representatives include six hundred representatives of activists in the National Patriotic Health Campaign and more than four hundred observers. They are representatives of advanced units that have achieved outstanding results in this year's Great Leap Forward in twelve aspects of agricultural socialist construction: agriculture, state farms, forestry, aquatic products, water conservancy and hydropower, meteorology, science, culture and education, health, commerce, transportation, and post and telecommunications, including representatives of many special districts, counties, and people's communes, and representatives of institutions in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. They represent the heroic 500 million peasants.

In recent days, delegations have arrived in Beijing one after another, carrying the achievements and experiences of this year's Great Leap Forward as gifts to the motherland and Chairman Mao. This year, representatives from high-yield grain counties in various provinces and regions, such as Shouzhang and Fan counties in Shandong, Xiaogan in Hubei, Anguo in Hebei, and Changge in Henan, all of which are high-yield counties for various grain crops, have arrived; representatives from counties producing 100, 200, and 300 catties of ginned cotton in various provinces and regions have also arrived. Representatives from high-yield units of various economic crops, as well as high-yield units in forestry, animal husbandry, and aquatic products, and advanced units in water conservancy construction, such as the famous Wushan in Gansu and Yuxian in Henan, have all arrived in Beijing. Famous people's communes from various provinces and regions, such as the Weixing (Satellite) Commune and Qiliying Commune in Suiping, Henan, and the Yingju Commune, also have representatives in Beijing. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has representatives in Beijing, and the Mishan Reclamation Area in Heilongjiang and the tropical and subtropical crop farms in South China also have representatives in Beijing. Among the representatives are farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen of all ethnic groups in our country, cadres who cultivate experimental fields, agricultural science and technology personnel, and local experts who have made outstanding creations in production this year. There are young people, women, the famous cotton girl from Hubei Province, and well-known old models such as Li Shunda, Geng Changsuo, and Wang Guofan. The vast majority of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members.

A preparatory meeting was held this afternoon. The meeting decided to hold a grand opening ceremony on the afternoon of the 25th. The preparatory meeting also decided to organize all representatives to earnestly study the two documents, "The Communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and "The Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes," during the conference.
