Xinhua News Agency, Accra, December 11th. A letter of congratulations from Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois, the prominent American Black leader and founder of the Pan-African movement, to the All-African People’s Conference was read by Dr. Du Bois' wife at the conference meeting on the 11th.

The letter said: "Your closest friends and neighbors are China, India, the rest of Asia, the Middle East, and the colored people of the island nations. The hearts of Africans were once closely linked with them, but now, due to European greed, they have long been divided. You form close relationships not only because of skin color but also because you have a deeper experience of slavery and contempt. You form close relationships with those in the white world who support and defend China and assist India, not with those who exploit the Middle East and South America."

Comparing the "aid" of Western countries with the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, he said that capital provided at high prices by colonial countries would allow the doomed colonial imperialism to linger on. "But today you can finally compare their aid with the aid of socialist countries like the Soviet Union and China, which, after infinite sacrifice, are finally able to provide the funds these countries need on better terms than the West... Accepting this aid does not mean bondage, enslavement, and colonial rule, which are the prices the West has demanded and continues to demand. Today the West expresses concessions, but you must be careful: it wants to turn some of your more fashionable and less discreet leaders into capitalists who are in league with white exploiters if they in turn induce the masses of their countries to pay a heavy price. You must exert every effort to fight against it."

    泛非运动创始人杜波依斯在致大会贺信中指出
    对西方殖民者必须要小心
    一定要尽一切力量和它作斗争
    据新华社阿克拉11日电  美国著名黑人领袖、泛非运动创始人杜波依斯博士给全非人民大会的贺信，在11日的大会会议上由杜波依斯的夫人宣读。
    贺信说：“你们最亲近的朋友和邻国就是中国、印度、亚洲的其余国家、中东、海岛国家的有色人民。非洲人的心一度是同他们紧密地联系在一起的，而现在，由于欧洲的贪婪长期被分割开来。你们结成紧密关系不仅仅是由于肤色而是由于你们对于奴役和蔑视有着较深刻的经历。你们是同白人世界中那些支持和保卫中国以及援助印度的人，而不是同那些剥削中东和南美的人结成紧密的关系的。”
    在把西方国家的“援助”同苏联等社会主义国家提供的无私援助作比较时，他说，殖民国家以高价提供的资本将会使注定要完蛋的殖民帝国主义得以苟延残喘。“但是你们今天终于可以把它们的援助同像苏联和中国这样的社会主义国家的援助作一番比较，它们经历了无限的牺牲，终于能够根据比西方好的条件为弱国提供这些国家所需要的资金。……接受这种援助并不意味着束缚、奴役和殖民统治，而这些正是西方曾经要求的和仍然在要求的代价。今天西方表示让步，但是你们必须小心：它要使你们的一些比较时髦而比较不谨慎的领袖变成和白色剥削者同伙的资本家，假如他们反过来诱使他们国家的群众付出惨重的代价的话。一定要尽一切力量和它作斗争。”
