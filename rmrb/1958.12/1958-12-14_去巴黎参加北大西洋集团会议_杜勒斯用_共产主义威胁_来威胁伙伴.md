Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles left Washington on a special plane on the 12th to attend the NATO Council meeting scheduled for the 16th of this month in Paris. Before his departure, he held talks with U.S. President Eisenhower. Dulles issued a statement upon his departure, saying that before attending the NATO Council meeting, he would hold "consultations" in Paris with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and West Germany on the Soviet Union's proposals regarding the West Berlin issue.

Dulles is clearly worried about the centrifugal tendencies within NATO. In his statement, he made no mention of the U.S.'s activities of aggression and creating tension everywhere, but again trotted out the hackneyed tune of the communist "threat" to intimidate partners in NATO. He said that this NATO meeting would be held "under the cloud of continued pressure by communist imperialism on the free world everywhere." Since the NATO Council meeting in May, "the communists have exerted pressure in the Middle East, the Far East, and now in Europe." He groundlessly described the Soviet Union's proposals for normalizing the situation in West Berlin as "exerting new pressure on the people of West Berlin." He said that he would hold "consultations on the problems caused by this situation" with the foreign ministers of France, Britain, and West Germany in Paris, and that he would discuss this issue at the NATO Council meeting.

Dulles also expressed his hope to meet with De Gaulle.

He finally called on the partners of the Atlantic Alliance to "maintain unity" and "maintain full defensive and deterrent strength," that is, to demand that they continue to follow the U.S. in expanding armaments and preparing for war.

On the same day, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy delivered a speech at the "Commonwealth Club" in San Francisco, slandering the Soviet Union's proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city as an attempt to "undermine Western unity," and reiterated the old tune of "unifying" Germany through so-called "free elections." He said that this was a "goal pursued by the United States for many years" and would never change.

### 去巴黎参加北大西洋集团会议  杜勒斯用“共产主义威胁”来威胁伙伴

    去巴黎参加北大西洋集团会议
    杜勒斯用“共产主义威胁”来威胁伙伴
    新华社13日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯12日乘专机离开华盛顿赴巴黎出席定本月16日举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议。他在动身前同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行了会谈。杜勒斯在动身时发表声明说，他在出席北大西洋集团理事会会议之前，将在巴黎同英、法、西德三国外交部长就苏联关于西柏林问题的建议进行“磋商”。
    杜勒斯显然对北大西洋集团的离心局面忧心忡忡。他在声明中对美国到处进行侵略和制造紧张局势的活动只字不提，而又搬出共产主义“威胁”的滥调来恫吓北大西洋集团中的伙伴。他说，北大西洋集团这次会议将是在“共产帝国主义对自由世界各地继续施加压力这样一种阴云下举行的”。自从北大西洋集团理事会5月会议以来，“共产党在中东、远东、现在又在欧洲施加了压力”。他毫无道理地把苏联关于使西柏林局势正常化的建议说成是“对西柏林的人民施加新的压力”。他说，他将在巴黎同法、英和西德的外交部长就这种情况“所引起的问题进行磋商”，而且将在北大西洋集团理事会会议上讨论这个问题。
    杜勒斯还表示希望与戴高乐举行会谈。
    他最后呼吁大西洋集团的伙伴要“保持团结”和“保持充分的防御力量和威慑力量”，也就是要求它们继续追随美国扩军备战。
    同一天，美国副国务卿帮办墨菲在旧金山“联邦俱乐部”发表演讲，诬蔑苏联关于变西柏林为自由城市的建议是要“破坏西方的团结”，并且重弹通过所谓“自由选举”来“统一”德国的老调，他说，这是美国“多年来所追求的目标”，绝不会有所改变。
