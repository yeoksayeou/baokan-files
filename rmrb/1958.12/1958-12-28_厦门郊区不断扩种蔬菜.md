Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 27th: In the suburbs of Xiamen city, at the forefront of coastal defense, the people's communes are constantly expanding the area for vegetable cultivation while adhering to the struggle against the enemy. Currently, the vegetables produced by these communes not only fully meet the needs of the military and civilians at the front, but can also be transferred out in large quantities.

In July of this year, vegetable production in Xiamen was hit by typhoons and rainstorms, and in August it was shelled by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Jinmen, resulting in damage to more than 8,000 mu of vegetable fields. However, under the leadership of the suburban party committee, and with the active supply of seeds and fertilizers by commercial and agricultural departments, the commune members replanted these fields in just about half a month.

Xiamen is located in a subtropical zone and can grow vegetables all year round. At the recent Fourth Municipal Vegetable Production and Marketing Balance Conference, it was decided that the planting area for various vegetables this winter and spring would be expanded to 84,000 mu. It is estimated that from now until March next year, vegetable production will reach 1.74 million dan. The daily market supply of vegetables has already increased from about 1,000 dan in the past to 1,500 dan.

    厦门郊区不断扩种蔬菜
    新华社福州27日电  海防前线厦门市郊区各个人民公社在坚持对敌斗争中，仍不断扩大蔬菜耕种面积。现在，这些公社生产的蔬菜，除能够充分满足附近前线军民的需要外，还可以大批外调。
    今年7月，厦门市的蔬菜生产曾受到台风暴雨的袭击，8月又受到金门蒋军炮击，共有八千多亩菜田遭到破坏，但是，各社社员在郊区党委的领导下，加上商业部门、农业部门积极供应种籽、肥料等，就使他们仅在半个月左右的时间内就把这些地补种起来了。
    厦门地处亚热带，终年可以种植蔬菜。在最近召开的全市第四次蔬菜产销平衡会议上，决定今冬明春各种蔬菜的种植面积扩大到八万四千亩。预计从现在起到明年3月止，蔬菜产量将达一百七十四万担。现在每天蔬菜的上市量，就已由过去的一千担左右增加到一千五百担。
