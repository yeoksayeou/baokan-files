Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: In the past week, the people of the entire nation have enthusiastically discussed the decision made by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, agreeing with Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestion that he not be nominated as a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China in the next term. After the Eighth Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session passed this decision on December 10th, to avoid a sudden shock when published in the newspapers, the announcement was delayed. Telephone conferences were held at each level to communicate the decision to people of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society across the country. Starting from the 11th, meetings were successively held in organizations at all levels, people's organizations, democratic parties, factories and mines, rural people's communes, military units, universities, middle and primary schools, stores, industrial and commercial circles, and street residents, religious circles, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic minorities in all ethnic regions across the country to convey this decision and conduct nationwide discussions. The discussions penetrated every corner of the country, and residents, both male and female, old and young, in urban and rural areas across the country, universally heard the communication and broadly and enthusiastically participated in the discussions.

According to reports from various regions, at the beginning of the discussions, everyone found it a little difficult to understand, and emotionally hoped that Comrade Mao Zedong could continue to serve as the Chairman of the state. Later, after detailed and patient explanations, the vast majority of people understood. They expressed agreement with this suggestion put forward by Chairman Mao himself and the decision of the Party Central Committee, approving of this proactive suggestion, and believing that doing so would be more beneficial to the country, to the people of the whole nation, and to the Party. Many people pointed out in the discussions that Chairman Mao's not serving as the Chairman of the state, but focusing solely on serving as the Chairman of the Party Central Committee, would allow him to concentrate more on dealing with the Party and the country's guidelines, policies, and line issues, and might also give him more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism. Doing so is in line with the long-term and fundamental interests of our country and the people of the whole nation, and it also does not hinder Comrade Mao Zedong, as the Chairman of the Party Central Committee, from continuing to exert his wise leadership over the work of the country. In the nationwide discussions, everyone believed that although Chairman Mao would not hold the post of the next Chairman of the state, he would still be the great leader unanimously loved by the people of all ethnic groups across the country. Everyone pointed out in the discussions that the Party Central Committee, headed by Chairman Mao, not only led our people to overthrow the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism represented by the Kuomintang reactionaries, which had been weighing on their heads for a long time, and achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution, but also guided the people of the whole country to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, advancing from one victory to another. In 1958, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country achieved an unprecedented great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and also realized the people's commune movement in the rural areas across the country, further guaranteeing the happy life and bright future of the people of the whole nation. Everyone believes that in the future, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups across the country, closely united as one, will advance along the road pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong and will surely continue to achieve even greater victories in the great cause of building socialism.

In the nationwide discussions, a small number of people, due to their love for the leader, still found it difficult to understand this issue for a while, even after considerable explanation. Party organizations at all levels will continue to patiently explain to them to help them understand the correctness of Chairman Mao's suggestion and the decision of the Party Central Committee.

In the nationwide discussions, everyone also anticipated that enemies at home and abroad would definitely take the opportunity to spread rumors and slander, but everyone believed that this would only be a futile effort. Chairman Mao's suggestion, the decision passed by the Party Central Committee, and the nationwide discussions precisely demonstrate the infinitely strong unity of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the infinitely strong unity of the Communist Party of China and the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and the infinitely strong unity of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, with the Communist Party of China as the core and Comrade Mao Zedong as the leader. The people of all ethnic groups across the country wholeheartedly trust the wise leadership of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and will strive with resolute action to realize the resolution on several issues concerning people's communes and the guidelines on the 1959 national economic plan adopted at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, presided over by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    毛主席永远领导着我们
    全国人民热烈讨论并同意毛主席的建议和党中央的决定
    衷心信赖以毛主席为首的中共中央的英明领导，坚决实现关于人民公社的决议和明年的计划方针
    新华社17日讯  在过去的一周中，全国人民热烈地讨论了中国共产党第八届中央委员会第六次全体会议同意毛泽东同志提出的关于他不作下届中华人民共和国主席候选人的建议的决定。党的八届六中全会在12月10日通过了这个决定之后，为了让人民在报纸上发表的时候不感觉突然，推迟决定公布时间，先逐级召开电话会议，把决定的内容传达到全国各族各界人民中去。从11日起，在全国各民族各地区的各级机关、各人民团体、各民主党派、各厂矿、各农村人民公社、各部队、各大中小学、各商店、工商界和街道居民、宗教界、归国华侨和少数民族人士中都先后召开了会议，传达了这个决定，进行了全民性的讨论。讨论深入到了全国每一个角落，全国城乡的男女老少居民普遍地听到了传达并广泛地热烈地参加了讨论。
    据各地报告，在讨论开始的时候，大家都有些想不通，在情感上都希望毛泽东同志能够继续担任国家的主席。后来经过详细的耐心的解释，绝大多数人想通了。他们表示同意毛主席自己提出的这个建议和党中央的决定，赞成这个积极的建议，认为这样做对于国家、对于全国人民、对于党都更有利。许多人在讨论中指出，毛主席不做国家主席，专做党中央的主席，可以让他更能够集中精力来处理党和国家的方针、政策、路线的问题，也有可能使他有较多的时间，从事马克思列宁主义的理论工作。这样做是符合我们的国家和全国人民的长远的和根本的利益的，而且这也并不妨碍作为党中央主席的毛泽东同志，对于国家工作继续发挥他的英明的领导作用。在全民讨论中，大家认为毛主席虽然不担任下届国家主席的职务，仍然是全国各族人民一致爱戴的伟大领袖。大家在讨论中指出，以毛主席为首的党中央不但领导我国人民推翻了长期压在头上的帝国主义、封建主义和以国民党反动派为代表的官僚资本主义的三座大山，取得了民主革命的伟大胜利，而且又引导全国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。在1958年，全国人民在毛泽东同志领导下，实现了空前未有的工农业生产的大跃进，并在全国农村中实现了人民公社化，使全国人民的幸福生活和光明前途获得了进一步的保证。大家相信，今后在以毛泽东同志为首的中共中央的领导下紧密地团结一致的全国各族人民，沿着毛泽东同志所指出的道路前进，必将在建设社会主义的伟大事业中继续取得更加巨大的胜利。
    在全民讨论中，有少数人由于对领袖的热爱，虽然经过相当的解释，对于这个问题一时还想不通。党的各级组织将继续对他们进行耐心的解释工作，使他们懂得毛主席提出的建议和党中央的决定的正确性。
    在全民讨论中，大家还估计到，国内外的敌人一定会乘机造谣诽谤，但是大家认为，这只是枉费心机。毛主席提出的建议、党中央所通过的决定和全民的讨论，正是说明了中国共产党以毛泽东同志为首的无限坚强的团结，说明了中国共产党和全国各族人民的无限坚强的团结，说明了全国各族人民以中国共产党为核心、以毛泽东同志为领袖的无限坚强的团结。全国各族人民衷心信赖以毛泽东同志为首的中共中央的英明领导，并将以坚决的行动，为实现这次毛泽东同志所主持的党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议和关于1959年国民经济计划的方针而奋斗。
