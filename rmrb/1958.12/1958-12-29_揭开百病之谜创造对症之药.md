Unveiling the Mysteries of All Diseases and Creating Targeted Medicines
Shi Gang, First Secretary of the CPC Hubei Echeng County Committee

I am not an expert in medicine, so I cannot offer any technical advice. However, as someone who suffers from many ailments, I always hope to get a "special medicine" that is effective for my specific conditions and to be cured as quickly as possible. I believe this is the desire of all patients.

Before liberation, "special medicines" mostly relied on imports. After liberation, while the Party and the People's Government vigorously produced special Western medicines, they also attached great importance to sorting out the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, unearthing many "special medicines" and "special therapies." However, the socialist construction of our motherland is developing rapidly. Our medical workers are doing work that cares for people, and people are the decisive factor in our cause. People and time are the most valuable. How can we cure all patients and cure them in the shortest possible time? Relying solely on the medical theories left by the ancients and foreigners is not enough. We must also use our own brains. Science is not an impenetrable secret. Every disease source is explored by people, and every good medicine is researched by people. Medical theory is also the experience accumulated by people from the practice of treating diseases. Things in ancient books and foreign books, whether affirmed or denied, are not necessarily correct. Things that cannot be found in books can be found in practice. Today, miracles have appeared in agricultural production, with wheat yielding more than 7,000 jin per mu and rice yielding more than 30,000 jin per mu. This is something that has never been seen in any book, ancient or foreign, and even experts have not dared to imagine. However, the working people have created it from practice after all. Look! Summarizing their experience would make such a valuable theoretical book! It seems that our medical workers must also emancipate their minds, break down superstitions, establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, carefully experiment, and deeply explore to unveil the mysteries of all diseases and create targeted medicines. Let the medicine of our motherland spread its wings and leap forward together with other construction undertakings, so as to better serve mankind and our communist cause.

Wan Wenji, a physician at Echeng County People's Hospital, has successfully tested "Vitamin B1 Nerve Acupoint Injection Therapy." Through several years of clinical practice, he has proven that it has good effects and has solved many diseases that were previously considered difficult to treat, greatly shortening the course of treatment. This spirit of hard work is worthy of study by all medical staff in the county. We believe that more creations and inventions will emerge among the medical workers in the county.

Here, I would like to introduce to you a small booklet by Dr. Wan Wenji, which is presented to you as the first flower blooming from the great leap forward of medical workers in the county.

[Editor's Note] Wan Wenji, a Western medicine internist at Echeng County People's Hospital, under the leadership and support of the hospital's Party branch, according to the central government's instructions on Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine, after several years of deep study and repeated experiments, based on the neurology of the great Soviet medical scientist Pavlov and the principles of acupuncture and moxibustion, a famous legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, used the acupoints of traditional Chinese medicine and the medicines of Western medicine to create a new injection therapy -- "Vitamin B1 Nerve Acupoint Injection Therapy." He has already compiled it into a book for publication. Comrade Shi Gang's article is a preface written for this book.

    揭开百病之谜创造对症之药
    中共湖北鄂城县委第一书记  石岗
    我对医学不内行，提不出什么技术性的意见来。不过我是个多病的人，总希望能得到对症的“特效药”，希望能在最快的时间内治好自己的病。我相信这也是所有病人的愿望。
      “特效药”在解放前多是依赖舶来品，解放后，党和人民政府在大力生产特效西药的同时，还十分重视整理祖国医学遗产，挖出了许许多多的“特效药”和“特效疗法”。但是，祖国的社会主义建设事业正在飞跃发展。我们医务工作者是做的关心人的工作，人是我们事业的决定因素，人和时间是最可贵的。我们如何能治好所有的病人，能在最短的时间内治好病人，这仅靠古人和外国人所留下的一点医理是不够的，还必须靠我们自己动脑筋。科学并不是揭不破的秘密，任何一种病源是人探讨出来的，任何一种良药也是人研究出来的，医理也是人从医病的实践中积累的经验。古书上，外国书上，肯定与否定的东西，不一定都是正确的。书上找不到的东西我们可以从实践中找到。今天农业生产上出现了小麦亩产七千多斤、水稻亩产三万多斤的奇迹，古今中外任何一本书上都没有，专家们连想都没有敢想过；但是，劳动人民毕竟从实践中创造出来了。你看！把他们的经验总结出来，该是一本多么有价值的理论书啊！看来，我们医务工作者也必须解放思想，破除迷信，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，精心实验，深入探讨，揭开百病之谜，创出对症之药。让祖国的医学张开翅膀，同其他各项建设事业一齐飞跃。更好地为人类、为我们共产主义事业服务。
    鄂城县人民医院万文继医师，试验成“维他命B1神经穴位注射疗法”，他通过几年来的临床实践证明，效果良好。解决了许多过去认为难治之症，大大缩短了疗期。这种苦钻精神，是值得全县医务工作人员学习的。我们相信在全县医务工作者中将会出现更多的创造发明。
    这里我向大家介绍万文继医师的一本小册子，作为全县医务工作者在大跃进中开放出的第一枝花朵献给诸君。
  〔编者附记〕鄂城县人民医院西医内科医师万文继，在院党支部的领导与支持下，根据中央关于西医学习中医的指示，经过几年来的深钻苦学，反复实验，根据苏联伟大的医学家巴甫洛夫的神经学说和祖国著名的医学遗产——针灸学的原理，用中医的穴位，西医的药品，创造了一种新的注射疗法——“维他命B1神经穴位注射疗法”。他已经把它编写成一本书出版。石岗同志此文，就是为这本书写的序言。
