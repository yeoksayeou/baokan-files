Rejoice!
    Xǔ Guǎngpíng

    In the meeting place of the National Women's Active Builders of Socialism Representative Conference, heroines from all walks of life gathered. Songs rang out everywhere, with mutual challenges and competitions. This kind of conference is a first for women. The dream of many years has come true today. Recalling that before liberation, when we wanted to hold a "March 8th" Women's Day meeting, even in Shanghai it was prohibited, we feel even happier about this conference and cherish every minute of it.

    The sisters all say that this conference is a treasure-seeking meeting. Inside and outside the venue, mutual visits and exchanges of experience can be encountered anytime and anywhere, and most of them are young people. Watching their enthusiasm is more than enough. The famous cotton girl from Hubei saw that Beijing-produced radishes could yield more than 60,000 catties per mu, and she herself wants to achieve a yield of 30,000 catties of wheat per mu next year. Liu Si'po, an 84-year-old family member of a martyr, expressed three wishes, the last of which is to build a large pig farm after returning home and make new contributions to come to Beijing again. Many representatives have put forward their plans and targets for striving for a greater leap forward next year based on their specific circumstances. Some representatives, after being educated at the meeting, launched challenges and responses to each other. Some groups even put forward collective guarantees. This conference of 2,500 people has plans for everyone and is full of heroes. From here, we can fully foresee that 1959 will bring an even greater leap forward!

    The representatives are truly worthy of their heroic qualities, and they influence and educate others with their practical actions anytime and anywhere. On their way to Beijing, they competed to clean the rooms and do a good job of sanitation in the train, setting an example for fellow passengers; in the hotel, in order to save travel expenses, they asked to sleep two people in one bed or on a large kang. This is a concrete manifestation of the socialist style!

    More than two thousand people, each with her own heroic deeds, are the true historical facts written by their own blood and sweat. After many setbacks and difficulties, today's victory has been achieved. Some wore the sheepskin coat given to them during the land reform to attend the meeting; some came with hands burned from steelmaking; some laughed happily in their dreams. The pain and sorrow of women for thousands of years have all disappeared. Today, on the socialist construction front, they are fighting side by side with men, helping each other, and working together, making contributions in the nationwide Great Leap Forward. Sisters, keep moving forward, the next gathering will surely bring more and greater laughter and victory!

    欢笑吧！
    许广平
    全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的会场里，各路巾帼英雄云集。到处响起了歌声，互相挑战，互相竞赛。这样的会，在妇女还是第一次。多少年希望的梦，今天实现了，回想起解放以前，我们要开一个“三八节”的妇女会，在上海也遭到禁止的时候，对这次的会，就更感觉到高兴，每一分钟都值得珍爱。
    姊妹们都说这次大会是取宝会。在会场内外，相互访问、交流经验的随时随地都能遇到，而且大多数都是青年人，瞧着她们这股劲头就十足加十足。湖北著名的棉花姑娘看了北京产的萝卜能亩产六万多斤，明年自己要实现亩产三万斤小麦。八十四岁的烈属刘四婆表示了三个愿望，其中最末一个是回去后要建设一个大型猪场，立功再上北京。许许多多代表都根据自己的具体情况提出了自己明年争取更大跃进的计划和指标。有些代表在会上受到教育后，相互之间展开了挑应战。有的组还提出集体保证。这个二千五百人的大会，人人有计划，个个是英豪，从这里完全可以预见到1959年要来个更大的跃进！
    代表们真不愧英雄本色，随时随地都以自己的实际行动影响和教育别人。在他们来北京的路上，在火车里争着打扫房间，弄好清洁卫生工作，给同车乘客做榜样；在旅馆里为了节约旅费，纷纷要求两人睡一床或睡大炕。这真是社会主义风格的具体表现！
    二千多人，每人都有她的一段英雄事迹，这是她们用自己的血汗写出来的真实的史实。经过多少挫折，几许困难，才有了今天的胜利。有的穿上土改时分给她的一件皮袄来开会；有的抱着炼铁烫伤了的手来参加；有的从睡梦中高兴地笑起来。妇女们千年来的痛苦和悲愁，统统消失了。今天，她们在建设社会主义的岗位上，同男子们并肩作战，互相帮助，共同劳动，在全民大跃进里立下了功勋。姊妹们，继续前进吧，下一次的会师，一定会带来更多更大的欢笑和胜利！
