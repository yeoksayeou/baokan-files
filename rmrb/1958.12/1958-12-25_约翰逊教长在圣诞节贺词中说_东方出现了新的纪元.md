Xinhua News Agency, London, December 24th. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Hewlett Johnson, said in his Christmas message today: "A new era has emerged in the East."

    He expressed his joy at the rising movement for peace among the people of the world and the achievements of the socialist camp. He said: "People everywhere are increasingly insistent that nuclear weapons testing must be stopped, nuclear missiles must be banned, and disarmament must be achieved step by step." He also said: "The Soviet Union has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and China has achieved astonishing development in industry and agriculture."

    Archbishop Johnson said: "In 1932, when Chiang Kai-shek ruled China, I saw the most severe famine, and the suffering of the people was astonishing. Famines occurred year after year. I also visited China in 1952 and 1956. Famine has disappeared. Now there is the high tide of 1958: the harvest is twice that of 1957, and every man, woman and child can obtain more than 1,100 pounds of grain."

    Johnson said: "On the basis of this high tide, China is enthusiastically taking new steps in collective life. This has even moved "The Times" to say: "The whole country is moving forward in a magnificent way in a new direction."

    "Communes have been established one after another in various provinces. These communes organize workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers on a large scale into one entity. In addition to paying wages, they also provide free meals, which can be eaten in the canteen or taken home.

    "In just one county, 6,882 cooks are working in 1,554 canteens, thereby liberating about 50,000 laborers who used to cook at home.

    "Since there is no need to worry about housework, creative genius will inevitably be brought into play."

    He said: "A new era has emerged in the East."

    约翰逊教长在圣诞节贺词中说
    东方出现了新的纪元
    中国在生产高潮中建立公社
    使人民创造性天才得以发挥
    新华社伦敦24日电  坎特伯雷教长休利特·约翰逊博士今天在圣诞节贺词中说：“东方出现了新的纪元。”
    他为世界人民要求和平运动高涨和社会主义阵营的成就表示高兴。他说：“世界各地人民愈来愈坚持：必须停止核武器试验，必须禁止核导弹，必须逐步实现裁军。”他还说：“苏联获得了空前的丰收，中国工农业获得了惊人的发展。”
    约翰逊教长说：“我在1932年蒋介石统治中国的时候看到最严重的饥荒，人们的苦难是惊人的。饥荒连年发生。我在1952年和1956年也到过中国。饥荒已经绝迹。现在出现了1958年的高潮：收成比1957年增加一倍，男女老幼每人都可以获得一千一百多磅谷物。”
    约翰逊说：“在这种高潮的基础上，中国热情地在集体生活方面采取了新的步骤。这甚至使“泰晤士报”也不得不感动地说：“全国正在朝着新的方向波涛壮阔地前进”。
    “各省相继成立公社，这种公社大规模地把工农商学兵组织起来，合为一体，除了付给工资外，还免费供应伙食，可以在食堂或者带回家去吃。
    “仅仅在某一个县里，就有六千八百八十二个炊事员在一千五百五十四个食堂工作，从而解放了五万左右在家庭中烧饭的劳动力。
    “既然不必操心家务，创造性的天才必然会得以发挥。”
    他说：“东方出现了新的纪元。”
