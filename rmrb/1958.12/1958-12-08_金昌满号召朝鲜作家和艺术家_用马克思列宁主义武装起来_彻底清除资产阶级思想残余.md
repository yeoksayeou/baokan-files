Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 7th: According to today's "Labor News," a national conference of Korean writers and artists was held in Pyongyang on the 5th to discuss issues related to literary and artistic work. More than 1,100 Korean writers and artists participated in the conference.

Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, pointed out in his speech that, thanks to the Party's correct literary and artistic policies, a solid foundation for people's literature and art has been laid in northern Korea in the thirteen years since liberation. He called on writers and artists to continue eliminating the remnants of bourgeois ideology and arming themselves with Marxist-Leninist and communist thought.

He emphasized that writers and artists should go deep into factories and rural areas to participate in labor and practical work. He said that this is the most effective way to eliminate old ideas and create good works. He called on writers and artists to advance "on the Chollima horse," just like the working people in various economic sectors.

Also speaking at the conference were Ha Ang-cheon, Minister of Science and Education Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, writers Han Seol-ya and Li Kiyong, and people's actor Hwang Chol, among others.

The speakers criticized certain remnants of bourgeois ideology that existed in Korean literary and artistic circles, and criticized errors in literary and artistic works such as the drama "Road of Flames," "Family," and the dance drama "The Tale of Chunhyang."
