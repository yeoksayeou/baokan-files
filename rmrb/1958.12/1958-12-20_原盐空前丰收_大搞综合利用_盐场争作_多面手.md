Xinhua News Agency, 19th: This year's salt production has seen an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics up to November, the national crude salt production has reached over 9.76 million tons, and it is estimated that it will reach 10.17 million tons by the end of the year, an increase of 23% compared to the actual output of 1957, the historical peak year. High-yield fields with yields of over 200 tons per hectare have emerged in Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces. The weather conditions in Huaibei this year were similar to last year, but the output increased by 44% compared to last year. The quality of crude salt is generally better than last year. For example, the average sodium chloride content of the salt produced by the first branch of Tangda Saltworks reached 89.7% (water test), an increase of 1.3% compared to last year.

This year, significant achievements have also been made in the comprehensive utilization of salt resources. A surge in the development of salt fertilizers, research and trial production of chemical products, and the addition of new products has emerged in salt fields across the country. Almost all salt fields have produced salt fertilizers, and more than 100 new products have been successfully trial-produced, including cutting-edge products. The comprehensive utilization of crude salt resources not only strongly supports national construction but also changes the single production aspect of salt enterprises themselves.

The salt-making industry is basically manual operation, and the technology is relatively backward. This year, a mass technical innovation movement has emerged in almost all salt-producing areas of sixteen provinces across the country. During the movement, employees put forward more than 45,000 rationalization proposals with certain value, more than ten times more than last year, of which more than 6,000 belong to inventions and creations. These inventions and creations have made a big step forward in the direction of mechanization and semi-mechanization of China's salt-making industry. The employees of the Hangu Saltworks in Hebei created and modified 87 kinds of tools in three months, becoming a red banner in the national salt industry's technical innovation movement. The tamping machine collectively created by the workers of this saltworks uses a machine to pull the axis instead of manpower, tamping the bottom of the crystallization pond and the evaporation pond, which is more solid and firmer than manual tamping, and the efficiency is nine times higher than manpower. The motorization of vehicles and the ball bearing of tools have blossomed everywhere in various salt fields. Thanks to technical innovation and the promotion of advanced tools, Tangda Saltworks produced more than 200,000 tons of salt this year than last year, while the labor force during the peak production period was more than 1,000 people less than last year.

This year, the development of the salt-making industry implemented the policy of walking on two legs, launching the masses to run medium-sized and small-sized salt fields while building large-scale salt fields. The scale of salt industry construction this year is large and the progress is fast, and the amount of investment exceeds the cumulative actual results of the first five-year plan, which can newly increase the production capacity of crude salt by 5 million tons. Among the newly added crude salt production capacity this year, medium-sized and small-sized salt fields account for 46%. Shandong has built 4,000 hectares of small salt fields this year, which have already produced 110,000 tons of salt, accounting for 10% of Shandong's crude salt production this year. In the construction of salt fields in various places, the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, mainly indigenous methods, and first indigenous then foreign" is adopted. Building salt fields with indigenous methods requires less investment, is faster, and is easier to carry out technical transformation, which is applicable to large, medium, and small salt fields. Many facts of mobilizing the masses to build salt fields with indigenous methods in various places have broken the superstition that "salt fields can only be run well by relying on a few technical personnel", creating good experience for the development of the salt-making industry in the future.

### 原盐空前丰收  大搞综合利用  盐场争作“多面手”

    原盐空前丰收  大搞综合利用
    盐场争作“多面手”
    新华社19日讯  今年盐业生产空前丰收。根据到11月为止的统计，全国原盐生产已达九百七十六万多吨，预计到年底可以完成一千零十七万吨，比历史上丰产年1957年的实际产量增加23％。辽宁、河北、山东、江苏等省都出现了每公顷单产二百吨以上的高产田。淮北今年气象条件和去年相差不多，但产量却比去年提高44％。原盐质量一般也比去年提高，如塘大盐场第一分场出产的盐，平均氯化钠含量达到89.7％（有水化验），比去年提高1.3％。
    今年在综合利用盐业资源方面成绩也很大。全国各盐场都出现了大搞盐类肥料、研究试制化工产品和增加新产品的热潮，各盐场几乎都生产出了盐类肥料，试制成功的新产品有一百多种，其中还包括有尖端产品。原盐资源综合利用，不仅有力地支援了国家建设，而且也改变了盐业企业本身的单一生产的面貌。
    制盐工业基本上是手工操作，技术比较落后。今年全国十六个省的产盐区几乎都出现群众性的技术革新运动。职工们在运动中提出了有一定价值的合理化建议四万五千多件，比去年多十几倍，其中属于发明创造的有六千多件。这些发明创造，使我国制盐工业向机械化、半机械化方向迈进了一大步。河北汉沽盐场职工三个月创造和改制了八十七种工具，成为全国盐业技术革新运动中的一面红旗。这个盐场工人集体创造的压轴机，用机器拉轴代替人力拉轴，压固盐场的结晶池底和蒸发池底，比人工压的坚固结实，效率比人力提高九倍。车子化和工具滚珠轴承化已在各盐场遍地开花。塘大盐场由于进行了技术革新，推广了先进工具，今年比去年多产盐二十万多吨，而旺产期间劳动力却比去年少一千多人。
    今年制盐工业的发展贯彻执行了两条腿走路的方针，在建设大型盐场的同时，放手发动群众大办中、小型盐场。今年盐业建设规模大、进度快，投资额超过了第一个五年计划累计实绩，可以新增加原盐生产能力五百万吨。在今年新增原盐生产能力中，中、小盐场占了46％。山东今年就建成小盐场四千公顷，已经产盐十一万吨，占山东今年原盐产量10％。各地建场中并采取“土洋结合、土法为主、先土后洋”的方针。用土法建盐场，投资少，速度快，进行技术改造也容易，不论大中小盐场都适用。各地发动群众用土法建盐场的许多事实，破除了“只有依靠少教技术人员才能办好盐场”的迷信，为今后制盐工业的发展创造了良好的经验。（附图片）
