    Frequently Go Deep into the Canteen to Help Improve Meals
    Hu Congchao, the leader of the Second Squad of the Renhe Brigade of the Changjiang People's Commune in Public Security County, Hubei Province, and He Xuesong, the Party Branch Secretary, often go to the kitchen to inspect and help with the work. During mealtimes, they go deep into the dining hall to listen to the opinions of the commune members. Some commune members reflected that it was inconvenient for eight people to eat at one table and requested to change it to one table per household. That night, they discussed this with the canteen cooks, accepted the suggestion, and changed it to one table per household the next day. Once, they heard commune members complain that the rice was cooked too hard. Secretary He went to the kitchen to discuss the matter with the cooks and personally made soft rice for the commune members. After the rice tasted good, the commune members complained again: they were tired of eating only braised radishes every day, and they wanted more variety. Secretary He discussed solutions with the cooks and made several different kinds of radish dishes, such as shredded radishes, steamed radish with rice flour, pickled radishes, and sour radishes. In addition, they added several other vegetables, which satisfied the commune members. When it was windy or rainy, and some elderly people couldn't come to the canteen to eat, they helped the cooks deliver the food to the elderly people's homes. Because the secretary and squad leader went deep into the canteen and cared about the lives of the commune members, the canteen's meals were constantly improved, which was very popular among the masses.

    经常深入食堂  帮助改善伙食
    湖北公安县长江人民公社仁和大队第二中队中队长胡从朝和党支书何学松，经常到厨房去检查和帮助工作。在开饭的时候，他们就深入到饭厅，听听社员们的意见。有的社员反映八人一桌吃饭很不方便，要求改为一户一桌。他们当天晚上就跟食堂炊事员研究，接受这个意见，第二天就改成一户一桌。有一次，他们听社员反映饭做硬了。何书记就下厨房跟炊事员研究，并亲自动手做软饭给社员吃。饭合口味了，社员们又反映：天天老吃烧萝卜，花样少。何书记又同炊事员想办法，把萝卜做出萝卜丝子、萝卜甑菜、酱萝卜、酸萝卜等几种花样；另外又增加了几种别的蔬菜，使社员们吃得满意。遇到刮风下雨时，有些老人不能到食堂来吃饭，他们就帮助炊事员把饭菜送到老人的家里。由于书记和中队长深入食堂，关心社员生活，使食堂的伙食不断得到改进，很受群众欢迎。
