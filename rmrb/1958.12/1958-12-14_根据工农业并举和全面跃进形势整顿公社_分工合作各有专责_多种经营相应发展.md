Sichuan Fushun Daishi Commune
	Change Comprehensive Teams into Various Specialized Teams
(According to Sichuan Daily News) In the work of rectifying and improving people's communes, Daishi People's Commune in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, first focused on rectifying labor organization, changing comprehensive production teams into specialized production teams, so that the basic-level system of the commune initially adapted to the new situation of the integrated development of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and the overall leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.
	Daishi People's Commune was established with five townships and one town. The whole commune is divided into four levels: below the commune is the district (equivalent to the original joint cooperative unit), below the district is the production brigade, and below the production brigade is the team. These teams are comprehensive production teams, encompassing everything from industry and agriculture to animal husbandry, cooking, childcare, and so on. This form of organization has significant advantages in completing rush tasks and organizing large-scale collaboration. However, it is not conducive to establishing a production responsibility system, nor is it suitable for the comprehensive development of various production and construction aspects of the commune. Although the commune has many specialized institutions, some work cannot be carried out consistently. The comprehensive production teams often neglect sideline occupations while focusing on agriculture; they neglect livelihood while focusing on production. Moreover, much manpower in these areas is not fully utilized due to improper allocation and unclear responsibilities.
	After discovering the above situation, the Fushun County Party Committee took Mayou District of Daishi People's Commune as a pilot project to rectify the basic-level labor organization. After research by the general branch and discussions by the masses, on the basis of unified thinking, the original comprehensive production teams were reorganized into several specialized teams according to production and living needs, labor conditions, and the opinions of the masses, under the unified leadership of the brigade. In addition to the three specialized teams directly under the jurisdiction of Mayou District, namely sewing, bamboo weaving, and straw sandal making, and six local nitrate plants, each brigade established specialized teams for plowing and harrowing, mid-cultivation management, livestock breeding, diversified operations, cooking, vegetables, and childcare. Each specialized team has its own specific responsibilities. Except when the district or brigade temporarily organizes rushes and implements unified allocation when necessary, the specialized teams usually carry out their own tasks separately and are linked to each other to implement small-scale collaboration.
	The change in the basic-level system of Mayou District immediately showed results. The commune Party committee immediately held an on-site meeting in Mayou District to promote it comprehensively. According to the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, the commune also directly administered three specialized teams for transportation, infrastructure construction, and afforestation. Each district also established specialized teams according to its own situation.
	Now, after strengthening socialist and communist education and changing the basic-level system, the whole commune has taken on a new look. In agricultural production, more than 34,000 mu of terraced fields have been plowed, and rapeseed and wheat have been weeded and top-dressed once. In industry, in addition to the original local nitrate plants, sugar mills, salt factories, paper mills, and brick and tile factories have been established. In sideline occupations, flour mills, bamboo weaving, and salt bag making have been carried out, with an income of more than 100,000 yuan in cash. In forestry, more than 70 mu of seedlings have been cultivated, and more than 17,000 mulberry trees have been planted.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei
	Anhui Fuyang Chahua Commune
	Reasonable Arrangement of Labor Force, No More Neglecting One Thing for Another
	According to Xinhua News Agency Hefei Electric Dispatch, the 10,000-person inspection team of Anhui Province has extensively penetrated into the rural areas and begun to inspect various rural tasks. The inspection team to Chahua People's Commune in Fuyang County, while inspecting the work, promptly helped the commune to properly arrange the labor force and overcome the phenomenon of neglecting one production task for another.
	Chahua Commune is a commune with a relatively good foundation in the county. However, since the establishment of the commune in September this year, the tasks of steel production, autumn harvest, autumn planting, and water conservancy construction have been relatively heavy, and the labor force has been felt to be lacking. No one has been assigned to manage the wheat fields. The promotion of new tools on the river network chemical construction sites is also insufficient.
	After discovering the above situation, the inspection team convened a meeting of commune cadres and immediately began to study and solve these urgent problems in current production. After calculating the task accounts and labor accounts, if all work tasks are carried out simultaneously without distinguishing priorities, the labor force will be lacking by more than 40%. Everyone unanimously agreed that in this situation, we should first concentrate our efforts on carrying out the second autumn harvest, grabbing the grain and cotton into the warehouse first, and then comprehensively carry out field management work such as checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing, and eliminating insects. Each wheat field should be contracted to a row and assigned to a person to establish a responsibility system. In the construction of water conservancy projects, the originally planned 18,000 people (accounting for 80% of the labor force) were reduced to 16,000 people. In addition to accelerating the production of water control tools to improve work efficiency, after the second autumn harvest is over and the field management work is ready, more manpower will be added to the water conservancy construction site, which will not affect the central work of water conservancy.
	After the commune re-arranged the labor force, in the three days from December 3 to 5, it organized more than 13,800 people to rush to harvest more than 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes again, collecting more than 6.75 million jin. It also threshed more than 96,000 jin of grain from rice straw and bean stalks. This grain can feed more than 90,000 people in the commune for more than half a month. The whole commune picked up 28,596 jin of discarded cotton, with an average of about five liang of cotton harvested per person. From the 6th, the whole commune has launched field management work such as wheat field topdressing.
	The Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the problems discovered by the inspection team in Chahua Commune are very important. It immediately convened a telephone conference, requiring the Party committees of all localities in the prefecture to pay attention to the reasonable arrangement of the labor force, conscientiously do a good job in the second autumn harvest, and organize specialized teams to carry out field management work. In the winter repair project of water conservancy, it is necessary to quickly produce various soil excavation and soil transportation tools in order to improve work efficiency.

(According to Hebei Daily News)
	Hebei Longguan County
	Both Industry and Agriculture Should Be Done Well, and Sideline Occupations Should Also Be Done Well
	According to Hebei Daily News, Longguan County in Hebei Province has re-adjusted the division of labor by starting with the implementation of the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture and the comprehensive development of various productions. After the adjustment, more than 34,000 male and female laborers and auxiliary laborers were put into sideline production. By the end of November, the income from sideline occupations reached 2.31 million yuan, an average of 34 yuan per person.
	When the Longguan County Party Committee initially put forward the call to vigorously develop sideline production this winter, some township and commune cadres believed that "industrial and agricultural production is too busy, and no one is engaged in sideline production." According to this situation, the County Party Committee first calculated the overall account of labor allocation in the county. There are more than 80,000 male and female laborers in the county, more than 20,000 engaged in steel production, more than 10,000 supporting other places, 30,000 engaged in agriculture, and more than 10,000 occupied by rural canteens, nurseries, processing plants, grazing, etc. There are also more than 10,000 people who can engage in sideline production. In addition, there are more than 20,000 male and female auxiliary laborers, who can all be put into the sideline production front. Then, the County Party Committee instructed the Party Committees of various communes to reasonably divide the labor according to the needs of industrial, agricultural, and sideline production, so that all laborers can be in their proper positions and give full play to their abilities. The nine communes of Dongfeng and Yuejin convened cadre meetings and commune members' meetings respectively, asking everyone to come up with ideas and methods. After reasonable arrangements, while doing a good job in industrial and agricultural production, 5,033 male and female laborers were drawn out and put into sideline production. After mobilizing the masses to discuss and debate, Dahaituo Commune also freed up more than 400 people after refuting the "labor shortage theory." Generally, 15%-20% of the total labor force in the thirteen communes in the county is invested in sideline occupations, and more than 16,000 male and female laborers engaged in sideline occupations are organized into 150 specialized teams.
	In late November, the County Party Committee, based on the priorities of various tasks, put forward the slogan "Every family acts, everyone's hands are not idle," and organized male and female auxiliary laborers to participate in production. In this way, the number of people participating in sideline production in the county quickly increased to more than 34,000.

    根据工农业并举和全面跃进形势整顿公社
    分工合作各有专责
    多种经营相应发展
    四川富顺代寺公社
    改综合队为各种专业队
    据四川日报消息  在整顿和提高人民公社的工作中，四川省富顺县代寺人民公社，首先抓住了整顿劳动组织，把综合生产队改为专业生产队，使公社基层体制初步适应了工农商学兵五位一体、农林牧副渔全面跃进的新形势。
    代寺人民公社是以五个乡、一个镇建立起来的。全社共分四级：公社以下是管区（相当于原来的联社单位），管区以下是生产大队，生产大队以下是小队。这些小队都是综合性的生产队，凡是工业、农业、饲养、炊事、保育等等，通通包下来。这种组织形式，在完成突击任务、组织大协作中，有显著的优点。但是，它既不利于建立生产责任制，也不适应公社各项生产建设全面发展的需要。尽管公社有许多专业机构，还是有些工作不能贯彻始终。各综合生产队，也常常是顾了农业，丢了副业；顾了生产，丢了生活。而这些方面又有许多人力因为调配不当，责任不明，没有充分发挥作用。
    富顺县委发现上述情况以后，即以代寺人民公社麻柳管区为试点，整顿基层劳动组织。经过总支研究、群众讨论，在思想一致的基础上，把原来的各个综合生产队，按照生产、生活需要、劳力情况和群众意见，分别编成若干专业队，由大队统一领导。麻柳管区除直辖缝纫、篾货、草鞋等三个专业队，和六个土硝厂以外，各大队分别建立了犁耙、中耕管理、耕畜饲养、多种经营、炊事、蔬菜、保育等专业队。每个专业队都有自己的特定责任。除必要时由管区或大队临时组织突击、实行统一调配外，各专业队平时都分头执行自己的任务，并且互相挂钩，实行小协作。
    麻柳管区改变基层体制立即收效。公社党委即在麻柳管区召开现场会议，全面推广。根据统一领导，分级管理的原则，公社还直辖运输、基建、造林三个专业队。各管区也分别根据自己的情况建立了专业队。
    现在，全公社在加强社会主义和共产主义教育，改变基层体制以后，面貌焕然一新。在农业生产上，三万四千多亩板田已经犁完，油菜、小麦已经薅了一次草，施了一次追肥。在工业上除原有的土硝厂以外，又建立了糖厂、盐厂、纸厂、砖瓦厂。在副业上搞了粉坊、编篾席、打盐包等，已经收入十多万元现金。在林业上已育苗七十多亩，栽桑树一万七千多株。
    安徽阜阳插花公社
    劳力合理安排不再顾此失彼
    据新华社合肥电  安徽省万人检查团已经普遍深入农村，开始检查各项农村工作。到阜阳县插花人民公社的检查团，一边检查工作，一边及时帮助这个公社妥善安排劳动力，克服了生产工作的顾此失彼现象。
    插花公社是全县基础比较好的一个公社。但是今年9月份成立公社以来，由于钢铁生产、秋收、秋种和水利建设等任务都比较重，劳动力很感缺乏，麦田也没有确定专人管理。在河网化工地上，新式工具推广也不够。
    检查团发现上述情况以后，就召开社干部会议，立即着手研究解决当前生产中的这些迫切问题。经过算任务账和劳力账，如果各项工作任务不分缓急地同时进行，劳力要缺乏40％以上。大家一致认为，在这种情况下应首先集中力量突击进行第二次秋收，把到手的粮食和棉花先抓进仓，接着全面开展查苗、补苗、追肥、灭虫等田间管理工作，块块麦田包到排，包到人，建立责任制。在兴修水利工程上，把原来安排的一万八千人（占劳动力的80％）削减到一万六千人，除加速赶制治水工具，提高工效以外，等第二次秋收结束和田间管理工作就绪后，再增添人力到水利工地上去，这样也并不影响水利这一中心工作。
    这个社重新安排了劳动力以后，在12月3日到5日三天当中，组织一万三千八百多人，突击把十万多亩山芋又收了一遍，共收到六百七十五万多斤，又在稻草和豆秸上打下了粮食九万六千多斤。这些粮食可以给全公社九万多人吃半个多月。全社采摘丢弃的棉花二万八千五百九十六斤，平均每人多收了约五两棉花。从6日开始，全社已展开麦田追肥等田间管理工作。
    中共阜阳地委认为检查团在插花公社发现的问题很重要，当即召开了电话会议，要求全专区各地党委注意劳动力的合理安排，认真做好第二次秋收，并组织专业队开展田间管理工作。在水利冬修工程上，要迅速赶制各种挖土、运土工具，以便提高工效。
    河北龙关县
    既搞好工农业又搞好副业
    据河北日报消息  河北省龙关县从贯彻工农业并举方针和全面发展各项生产入手，重新调整了劳动分工。调整后，有三万四千多名男女劳力和辅助劳力投入了副业生产。到11月底，副业收入达二百三十一万元，平均每人三十四元。
    当起初，龙关县委提出今冬大力发展副业生产的号召的时候，有些乡、社干部认为“工农业生产太忙，副业生产无人搞”。县委根据这种情况，首先算出了全县劳力支配大账。全县共有男女劳力八万多人，搞钢铁生产的两万多人，支援外地的一万多人，农业占三万人，再除去农村食堂、托儿所、加工厂、放牧等占用的一万多人，还有一万多人能搞副业生产。此外，有男女辅助劳力两万多人，可全部投入副业生产战线。接着县委就指示各公社党委，根据工、农、副业生产的需要，合理分工，使所有劳力各得其所，各尽其能。东风、跃进等九个公社，都分别召开了干部会议、社员会，让大家出主意，想办法。经过合理安排，在搞好工、农业生产的同时，抽出了五千零三十三名男女劳力，投入了副业生产。大海陀公社经过发动群众鸣放辩论，驳倒了“劳力紧张论”以后，也腾出了四百多人。全县十三个公社投入副业的一般都占总劳力数15％—20％，并把搞副业的一万六千多名男女劳力，组成了一百五十个专业队。
    11月下旬，县委又根据各项工作的轻重缓急，提出了“家家都行动，人人手不闲”的口号，组织男女辅助劳力参加生产。这样，全县参加副业生产的很快增到三万四千多人。
