Running Own Primary, Middle and Universities: Workers Pursue Education on the Spot
Bengbu Machinery Plant Establishes a Complete Educational System

(Our report) The Bengbu Machinery Plant in Anhui Province broke with formalism and skepticism, relying on its own efforts to establish schools at all levels, including primary, middle, and university, and also established a scientific research institute, creating a complete educational system.

The Bengbu Machinery Plant began large-scale operation of various levels of schools starting in July of this year. Currently, the primary school has six classes with 250 students; the middle school has fourteen classes with over 1,000 students; and the industrial university, according to work needs, has seven departments including metal structure, metallurgical heat treatment, tool machinery, special machinery, power machinery, finance and economics, and factory management, with 400 students. In order to train newly recruited workers, the factory also established a technical school with over 3,000 students who have recently joined the factory. Workers entering the various levels of schools will be upgraded and promoted in order, all the way to university graduation.

The large-scale operation of various levels of schools, especially the self-run industrial university, at the Bengbu Machinery Plant, underwent a sharp ideological struggle. Although there were difficulties in running primary and middle schools, there was not much resistance. However, when it came to running a university, some engineering and technical personnel opposed it. Some people said, "We can liberate our minds in other things, but workers going to university is not a matter of breaking superstitions and liberating our minds." Some people said, "Without professors, without equipment, how can we run a university?" Others emphasized that production was busy and there was no guarantee of learning. After studying this situation, the factory Party committee believed that these reflected the idea of running schools according to bourgeois conventions. In essence, these people still did not believe that factories could run universities and that workers could receive higher education. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee decided to conduct debates among all employees by carefully calculating accounts, presenting facts, and reasoning to the factory in order to breakthrough. At the debate, they first calculated several accounts: The first was the production task account. This year's production task of the entire factory has quadrupled compared to last year. The products have changed from manufacturing simple agricultural tools to requiring the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment and large-scale power machinery. This means that we cannot rely solely on labor intensity, but must vigorously carry out technological revolutions and improve technical skills in order to complete such complex and massive new tasks. The second account was the technical strength account. The number of workers in the factory has increased from more than 1,000 to more than 5,000, and it is expected to increase to 10,000 to 20,000 during the Second Five-Year Plan. Technical strength must increase accordingly, and it is estimated that 1,000 technical cadres will be needed. And technical strength needs to be cultivated by ourselves. Xie Deyin, the worker-turned-vice factory director, only studied in a private school for four years, but after several years of hard study and practice, he has reached the level of chief engineer, which shows that workers can go to university and become people with high technical and cultural levels. The third account was the teaching staff account. The factory has two engineers, nine people equivalent to engineers, more than thirty technicians, full-time teachers from three colleges and universities, and more than eighty experienced veteran workers. In terms of students, the factory has one hundred and six technicians above the fourth grade, and more than one hundred high school graduates. Teachers can be solved, and there is also a basic student team, so running a university can be done well. After carefully calculating the accounts, all the employees of the factory decided to break through all obstacles and difficulties and set up their own middle school and industrial university to cultivate all the workers in the factory to the level of university graduation, master scientific and cultural knowledge, and cultivate technicians and engineers from the workers. After the big debate, the formalists and skeptics who opposed running the university were completely isolated.

After the Bengbu Machinery Plant established a complete set of schools, it has vigorously promoted the plant's technological innovation and scientific research, and promoted the development of production due to the teaching methods that combine theory with practice. Worker Sun Fugui said: "In the past, I only knew how to look at the flames and the temperature when operating heat treatment. Now I also understand that there are many physical and chemical changes here." Worker Fan Junhua said: "In the past, when a machine broke down, I groped for a long time but couldn't find the way. Now learning is really useful, and I can solve practical problems after learning." In the past, the biggest difficulty for many workers in carrying out technological innovation was that they could not draw. After learning drafting, they have been able to draw simple sketches of what they want to create. After worker Yuan Zhentang went to university, he drew his own sketches and experimented with improving the lathe boring cylinder multi-tool and vertical universal grinding cylinder tool, greatly improving production efficiency. In the vigorous effort of steel production, he also assisted engineers in creating a toothless saw, which increased the production of large parts for the original smelting equipment by more than ten times. Some workers immediately linked their actual work and studied problems after learning philosophy. For example, Wang Guodong, a worker in the compressor workshop, realized after studying two lessons in philosophy that everything is changing and developing, and he should not stick to the old ways in his work, but should constantly improve. Under the guidance of this point of view, Wang Guodong boldly thought and acted boldly, and finally improved the tool for processing the wind damper of the blower. In the past, one part had to be processed twice, but after the improvement, it only needs to be processed once, which shortens the process by six to eight hours, greatly accelerating the manufacturing speed of the blower.

The Bengbu Machinery Plant has already formulated a plan for the intellectualization of all the workers in the plant. According to this plan, all workers in the plant will systematically study the three courses of socialism and communism education, philosophy, and political economics in terms of political courses. In terms of majors, all existing workers in the plant will gradually popularize higher education, reach the level of university graduation, and be trained to become engineering and technical personnel and factory management personnel who are both red and expert.

    自办大中小学  工人就地升学
    蚌埠机械厂建立一套完整的教育体系
    本报讯  安徽省蚌埠机械厂打破正规论和怀疑论，自力更生，开办了小学、中学、大学等各级学校，还成立了科学研究所，建立了一套完整的教育体系。
    蚌埠机械厂大规模开办各级学校是从今年7月份开始的。现在小学有六个班，学员二百五十人；中学有十四个班，学员一千多人；工业大学按工作需要设有金属结构、冶金热处理、工具机械、特种机械、动力机械、财经、工厂管理等七个系，学员四百人。为了训练新进厂的工人，这个厂还开办了技术学校，学员是新进厂不久的工人，共有学员三千多人。进入各级学校的工人在学习中将按次序升级升学，一直到大学毕业。
    蚌埠机械厂大办各级学校，特别是自办工业大学，曾经过尖锐的思想斗争。办小学、中学虽然也有困难，但遇到阻碍还不多。一提到办大学时，就遇到有些工程技术人员的反对。有些人说：“别的可以解放思想，工人上大学可不是破除迷信解放思想的问题。”有些人说：“没有教授，没有设备，怎能办起大学？”有些人则强调生产忙，学习没有保证。厂党委研究这种情况后，认为这些都反映的是按资产阶级陈规办学的思想，这些人实质上，还是不相信工厂能办大学，工人能受高等教育。厂党委针对这种情况，决定通过算细账，摆事实，讲道理，在全体职工中开展辩论，在辩论会上，先算了几笔账：第一笔算生产任务账。全厂今年的生产任务比去年猛增四倍，产品由原来制造简单的农具到要求制造冶金设备和大型动力机械，这样就不能仅凭劳动强度，必须大闹技术革命，提高技术水平，才能完成这样复杂庞大的新任务。第二笔算技术力量账。全厂的工人已由一千多人增加到五千多人，第二个五年计划还要增加到一万至二万人，技术力量必须随之增多，技术干部预计就需要增加到一千人。而技术力量是需要自己培养的。工人出身的谢德银副厂长只读过四年私塾，经过几年来苦学苦练，已达到总工程师水平，说明工人能上大学，能够成为有高度技术文化水平的人。第三笔算师资账，全厂有工程师二人，相当于工程师的九人，技术员三十多人，三个大专学校毕业的专职教师和八十多个经验丰富的老工人。在学生方面，全厂有四级以上技工一百零六人，高中毕业生一百多人。师资能解决，也有基本学生队伍，所以办大学是可以办好的。经过算细账以后，全厂职工决定冲破一切阻挠和困难，自己创办中学和工业大学，把全厂工人培养到大学毕业的水平，掌握科学文化知识，从工人中培养出技术员和工程师来。经过大辩论，反对办大学的正规论者和怀疑论者完全孤立了。
    蚌埠机械厂办了一整套学校以后，由于采取理论联系实际的教学方法，已经有力地推动了厂内的技术革新和科学研究，促进了生产的发展。工人孙富贵说：“以前操作热处理只知道看火苗，看热度，现在还了解这里有许多物理变化和化学变化。”工人范俊华说：“过去机器发生故障，摸了好半天还找不到路子，现在学习真管用，学了就能解决实际问题。”很多工人过去在搞技术革新中最大的困难是不会绘图，在学过制图学以后，他们已能把自己想要创造的东西画出简单的草图。工人袁镇堂上大学后，自己绘制草图，试验改进了车床鎕缸多刀工具和垂直万能磨缸工具，大大提高了生产效率。在大搞钢铁生产中，他还协助工程师创造了无齿锯，使原来冶炼设备大型零件的生产，提高了十几倍。有些工人学了哲学以后，马上联系实际工作，研究问题。如压缩机车间工人王国栋在学了两课哲学以后，认识到不论什么东西都是变化发展的，联系到工作也不能抱住老一套，应该不断改进。王国栋在这种观点指导之下，大胆想大胆干，终于改进了鼓风机阻风叶加工的刀具，过去一个零件要加两次工，改进以后只要加一次了，在这道工序上就缩短了六小时到八小时，大大加速了鼓风机的制造速度。
    蚌埠机械厂已经拟订出了全厂工人知识化的规划。根据这个规划，全厂工人在政治课程方面将有计划地学完社会主义和共产主义教育、哲学、政治经济学三门课程。在专业方面，全厂现有工人将逐步普及高等教育，达到大学毕业水平，培养成为又红又专的工程技术人员和工厂管理人员。      （茀君）
