This newspaper reports from Hangzhou on the 12th: YuHang County in Zhejiang Province has built thousands of factories and tens of thousands of stoves to produce native fertilizer. From May of this year to the present, the county has established 4,603 native fertilizer factories, an average of 650 factories per people's commune. These fertilizer factories have produced more than 3.75 million dan of dozens of types of native and refined fertilizers, equivalent to 350,000 dan of fertilizer powder, enabling the county's more than 220,000 mu of farmland to apply an average of 1,700 jin of native and refined fertilizers per mu.

Several months of practice have proven that these native fertilizers have five major characteristics: First, they are strong in fertility and highly effective, containing the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Most are organic fertilizers, or a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Many types of native fertilizer take effect quickly when applied to the fields. Second, they are locally sourced, utilizing abundant local or nearby resources as the main raw materials. For example, phosphate ore, oil shale, peat, bittern, old wall soil, weeds, and bones have all become excellent raw materials for native fertilizer, with low costs. Third, the tools and equipment are simple. Most can produce fertilizer with just a stove and a pot, and some use old jars, old wooden basins, and old pipes with good results. Fourth, they are easy to manufacture, easy to apply, easy to transport, and save labor. Fifth, they can be produced at any time according to the needs of crops, making it timely to apply topdressing.

When YuHang County began to set up native fertilizer factories, some leading cadres had very strong mystical views of the word "chemical," believing that experts and mechanical equipment were essential, and without these, it could not be done. In response to this situation, the YuHang County Party Committee decided that the secretary should take command and organize and lead the trial production of fertilizer. A chemical research group of thirteen people, including the secretary and deputy secretary of the County Party Committee and the director of the County Party Committee Office, was established. In addition to studying reference books and researching the experiences of other regions, they used the county's abundant oil shale as the main raw material, plus gypsum, soil nitrate, bone meal, etc., to try to produce a nitrogen fertilizer. The first time was unsuccessful, so they analyzed various raw materials many times to find the cause of the failure, and then made modifications to the ingredients and changed the operating methods. In this way, the first type of native fertilizer produced by the county itself—oil shale nitrogen fertilizer—was successfully produced. Then, more than thirty trials were conducted, and six types of native fertilizer, such as oil shale nitrogen fertilizer, mud phosphate fertilizer powder, and oil shale fertilizer mud mixed fertilizer powder, were successfully produced. The test results showed that the nitrogen content was relatively high and had good effects when applied to the fields.

Once the YuHang County's indigenous method of making fertilizer was successful, it was promoted throughout the county with irresistible force. Everywhere people were building brick stoves, transporting firewood and sending pots, teams were setting up factories, and everyone welcomed it, forming a climax in a very short time. Not only did all localities learn and adopt the methods of various indigenous fertilizer production methods successfully trialed by the chemical research group, but they also carefully researched and conscientiously trialed more than thirty kinds of new indigenous fertilizers, including nitrogen fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer, and mixed fertilizer, which was truly a scene of blooming flowers, dazzlingly beautiful.

In the comprehensive promotion of native fertilizer, many areas have built native fertilizer stove groups and kiln groups in units of small teams, large teams, or communes, collectively researching, trial-producing, and producing. Farmers believe that doing so has five major benefits: it is easy to lead; it is easy to arrange labor; it is easy to solve technical problems; it is easy to improve product quality; and it is easy to produce according to plan.

After August, YuHang County began to develop towards normalization, high yield, and high efficiency in a guided manner on the basis of the comprehensive popularization of the native fertilizer industry. The county established a native fertilizer production line. Liu Zemian, deputy secretary of the County Party Committee, personally took command and equipped six full-time cadres to establish an office as the general command headquarters. All seven people's communes in the county have established native fertilizer general factories, large teams have branch factories, and small teams have small factories. All native fertilizer factories can produce various native fertilizers as needed and trial-produce new products. Many factories have promoted the "Six Determinations," which are: determine personnel, determine quality, determine quantity, determine time, determine operating procedures, and determine inspection. The county and communes have also established scientific research institutes (groups) to strengthen technical leadership. The county also ran training classes on native fertilizer to gradually ensure that commune members could understand some of the techniques of native fertilizer.

YuHang County also combined the shock production of native fertilizer with regular production, and the production of native fertilizer with the production of native miscellaneous fertilizer. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting and the vigorous development of steel production, they took the following measures: the native fertilizer factories run by the county and communes maintain regular production, while the branch factories and small factories prepare raw materials so that they can be organized for shock production at any time.

YuHang County also conducted on-site appraisals of more than thirty types of native fertilizer products that had already been manufactured throughout the county, affirmed and promoted more than twenty types of native fertilizer that had good application effects in early rice, and researched and improved the remaining six or seven types of native fertilizer with low fertilizer efficiency. All localities in the county have continuously created new varieties of native fertilizer and methods of saving raw materials and equipment on the basis of the original.

Recently, the National On-site Conference on Fertilizer Accumulation and Production was held in YuHang County. In order to strive for a bumper spring flower harvest next year, the communes in YuHang County have launched a new upsurge in vigorously developing native fertilizer while engaging in organic fertilizer. In the past half month, the county has manufactured and promoted a total of more than fifty new varieties of native fertilizer, totaling more than 230,000 dan.

### 发动群众就地取材就地生产精细肥料  余杭千厂万灶大造土化肥  专辟肥料战线，实施“六定”办法，向正常化高产化高效化发展

    发动群众就地取材就地生产精细肥料
    余杭千厂万灶大造土化肥
    专辟肥料战线，实施“六定”办法，向正常化高产化高效化发展
    本报杭州12日电  浙江省余杭县千厂万灶大造土化肥。从今年5月到目前为止，全县已办起四千六百零三座土化肥厂，平均每个人民公社有六百五十个厂。这些化肥厂已经生产出几十种土制化肥和精制肥料三百七十五万多担，相等于三十五万担肥田粉，使全县二十二万多亩农田平均每亩能施一千七百斤土制化肥和精制肥料。
    几个月的实践证明，这些土制化肥有五大特点：第一是肥力强，肥效高，含有氮磷钾三要素，大多数是有机质肥料，或是有机质和无机质相结合的肥料，许多种土化肥施到田里很快就见效。第二是就地取材，利用本地或附近的丰富资源作为主要原料。例如磷矿、石煤、泥炭、苦卤、老墙土、杂草、骨头等，都已成为很好的土化肥原料，成本低廉。第三是工具设备简单，大多是一灶一锅就可生产化肥，有的把旧坛罐、旧木盆、旧管子利用起来，效果很好。第四是制造方便，施肥方便，运肥方便，而且节约劳力。第五是可以随时根据农作物需要进行生产，及时施追肥。
    余杭县开始举办土化肥厂时，有些领导干部对“化”字有很重的神秘观点，认为一要专家、二要机械设备，不如此不能办。根据这个情况，余杭县委决定书记挂帅，组织并领导试制化肥工作。一个包括县委正副书记、县委办公室主任在内的十三人化学研究小组便成立起来。他们除找参考书学习和研究其他地区的经验外，还用本县藏量丰富的石煤来作主要原料，加上石膏、土硝、骨粉等，试制一种氮肥。第一次没有成功，他们便对各种原料进行多次分析，找出失败的原因，于是作了配料上的修改，又改变了操作方法。这样，这个县自己生产的第一种土制化肥——石煤氮肥就成功地制出来了。接着又进行了三十多次试制，先后试制出了石煤氮肥、地泥淀肥田粉、石煤肥泥混合肥田粉等六种土制化肥，化验结果，含氮量都较高，施在田里有良好效果。
    余杭县土法制化肥一成功，就以锐不可当之势在全县范围内推开，处处砌砖搭灶，运柴送锅，队队办厂，人人欢迎，在很短的时间内就形成高潮。各地不但学习和采用化学研究小组试制成功的各种土法制化肥的方法，而且精心钻研，认真试制出三十多种新的土化肥来，包括氮肥、磷肥、钾肥和混合肥料，真是百花遍地开，灿烂夺目。
    在全面推广土制化肥中，许多地区以小队、大队或社为单位建成土化肥的灶群和窑群，集体研究、试制和进行生产。这样做，农民们认为有五大好处：便于领导；便于安排劳力；便于解决技术问题；便于提高产品质量；便于按计划生产。
    8月份以后，余杭县开始在土制化肥工业全面普及的基础上，有领导地向正常化、高产化、高效化发展。全县建立了一条土化肥的生产战线。由县委副书记刘泽绵亲自挂帅，配备六个专职干部成立办公室，作为总指挥部。全县七个人民公社都设立土化肥总厂，大队有分厂，小队有小厂。所有土化肥工厂都可根据需要来生产各种土化肥，试制新产品。许多工厂推广了六定，这就是：定人，定质，定量，定时，定操作规程，定检查。县与公社还建立了科学研究所（组），加强技术领导。县里又办了有关土化肥的训练班，逐步做到公社社员都能懂得土化肥的一些技术。
    余杭县又把土化肥的突击生产与经常生产结合起来，土化肥生产和土杂肥生产结合起来。在秋收秋种和大搞钢铁生产期间，他们采取了如下的措施：县办、公社办的土化肥厂保持经常生产，分厂和小厂则作好原料准备，以便随时组织突击。
    余杭县还对全县已经制造出的三十多种土化肥产品进行了实地的鉴定，肯定和推广了其中二十多种在早稻中施用效果良好的土化肥，对其余六、七种肥效不高的土化肥，进行了研究和改进。全县各地在原有的基础上，不断创造出新的土化肥品种和节约原料、设备的办法。
    最近，全国积肥、造肥工作现场会议在余杭县举行，余杭县各公社为了争取明年春花大丰收，在搞有机肥料的同时，又掀起一个大搞土化肥的热潮，半月来，全县制造和推广的土化肥新品种共有五十多种，二十三万多担。
