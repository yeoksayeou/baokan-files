    Fountain of Friendship
    Kim Shin-bok, Korea

    Comrade Zuo was delirious, his lips were burned black, and his whole body was feverish. Even the cool honey water no longer tasted sweet.

    Old Lady Park ran out again with the water jar on her head. In this dog-day heat, even spring water as cool as ice quickly became lukewarm.

    Comrade Zuo's throat was dry and red, and he was unconscious. The old lady hoped his temperature would drop, so she brought water from the spring again and again. The spring wasn't close! It was more than two hundred meters away. What a strenuous task for an old lady of sixty!

    In these turbulent days, crazy enemy planes were dropping bombs anytime, anywhere. The hateful American beasts had already bombed this small village of less than fifty households twice. In the blazing house, a baby seemed to be crying. Without hesitation, Comrade Zuo rushed into the smoke-filled depths, quickly picked up the unconscious child, and ran out.

    Unfortunately, Comrade Zuo was discovered by the bandits, and the diving enemy plane strafed him fiercely.

    The fire was still burning, and he fell.

    The villagers rushed from all directions and rescued Comrade Zuo and the child.

    Comrade Zuo's injuries were very serious. The bullets not only pierced his thigh, but also caused two or three serious burns.

    The villagers decided to arrange for Comrade Zuo to stay at Old Lady Park's house for temporary emergency treatment.

    Unconscious Comrade Zuo, under the meticulous care of the old lady, gradually regained consciousness after four days.

    "My Amani, my Amani!"

    When Comrade Zuo learned that it was this old lady who had been tirelessly bringing him cool water day and night, he was so moved that he leaned on the old lady and shed tears.

    After some time, a stretcher-bearer from the Volunteer Army rear hospital came and carried him away.

    Comrade Zuo lay on the stretcher, holding Old Lady Park's hand tightly, choked with emotion and said:

    "My mother! Muer (note), thank you! Muer, thank you!"

    "No, child! I hope you recover soon and go fight the enemy!"

    Old Lady Park wiped away the tears she couldn't hold back.

    They left. The old lady waved her hand, watching them until they disappeared.

    Another month or so passed.

    Old Lady Park was pickling salted vegetables when she suddenly saw a Volunteer soldier running towards her from the rugged mountain path.

    "Amani! My mother!"

    It was Comrade Zuo.

    "Oh my, my child, you're here!"

    The old lady hurried out of the garden, lovingly embracing Comrade Zuo.

    "Let me see! How are your injuries?"

    Comrade Zuo smiled, stretched out his arms and legs, and waved them vigorously, meaning they had long been healed. They hugged each other warmly again.

    Afterwards, Comrade Zuo immediately took a shovel from the earthen house and began to dig in the ground beside the house.

    Old Lady Park didn't know what was going on for a moment, she just stared.

    "Oh dear, what are you doing! Sit down and rest!"

    The old lady guessed that Comrade Zuo wanted to dig a well for her and definitely didn't want him to do it.

    Comrade Zuo did not listen to the advice and continued to dig.

    Later, she learned that Comrade Zuo had come here three days before his discharge from the hospital in order to dig a well for the old lady.

    Comrade Zuo persistently dug the well. The next day, after noon, spring water finally gushed out.

    Comrade Zuo quickly moved large stones and laid them into a neat and solid well ring.

    "Amani! You have water here!"

    Comrade Zuo scooped a ladle of spring water and handed it to the old lady...

    The next evening, Comrade Zuo left. However, the story of him digging a well for Old Lady Park spread among the people.

    After the armistice, Old Lady Park's earthen house had also been replaced with a tiled house.

    This new house was built on the original site according to Old Lady Park's wishes. Although it was a bit inconvenient because it was far from the main village, she firmly refused to move because the well that Comrade Zuo had dug with his own hands was here.

    The old lady's life became more and more happy, and her longing for Comrade Zuo deepened.

    The news of the Chinese People's Volunteers' triumphant return home came. The old lady went to the station every day from three miles away to see them off.

    The old lady boiled the well water, put it in a tightly wrapped water jar, and brought it to the station. Where could the old lady, with the heart of a loving mother, find Comrade Zuo? But she was not disappointed.

    "They are all Comrade Zuo, they are all my children, children! Please drink, this is the Korean water that you defended with your blood, even if you only drink a mouthful!"

    Old Lady Park sincerely and diligently offered water to the Volunteers.

    A few days later, a train full of returning Chinese People's Volunteers arrived.

    A young soldier with a national flag medal, military merit medals, and other glittering commemorative medals on his chest jumped off the train and looked around in the crowd as if looking for a relative.

    Suddenly, the young soldier stood in front of the old lady.

    The old lady also saw him. This was so sudden!

    The Volunteer recognized Old Lady Park and suddenly threw himself on her, shouting:

    "Amani! Amani! My mother!"

    "My child! You're here!"

    Their hot tears couldn't help but flow.

    "Child! I really didn't expect it! I thought I would never see you again!"

    As the old lady spoke, she hurriedly poured out a bowl of water.

    "This is the water drawn from the well you dug. I prepared it for you long ago. Are you thirsty? Even if you only drink a mouthful."

    Comrade Zuo respectfully took the old lady's water and drank a few mouthfuls. Then, he took off his military canteen from his shoulder and filled it again.

    "Seeing it is like seeing my Korean mother, like seeing the beautiful three thousand li of Korean land. I will preserve it forever!"

    Comrade Zuo prepared to take this pot of water back to his beloved motherland.

    "My child, now that we are separated today, when will we meet again?"

    The old lady then said:

    "Our lives are getting better and better. A tiled house has been built next to the well you dug with your own hands. I really want to keep you at my house for a couple of days!"

    The whistle shrieked sharply, and the train moved slowly.

    Comrade Zuo and the old lady hugged each other tightly again.

    The deep feelings of reluctance to part turned into uncontrollable tears.

    Today we are seeing off our beloved comrades-in-arms, but the friendship burning in the hearts of the people of the two countries will not lose its brilliance at all, just like the spring water that Comrade Zuo dug, flowing endlessly.
  
  [Note] "Muer" is the Korean word for "water".

    友谊泉
    朝鲜  金信复
    左同志说着呓语，嘴唇已烧黑，全身都发烫。清凉的蜜水也已经感觉不出什么甜味了。
    朴大娘又顶着水罐跑出去了。在这三伏酷暑，即使像冰一般清凉的泉水，很快就变得温热了。
    左同志的喉头干燥得通红，昏迷不醒。大娘满心希望他的体温下降，一次又一次地提来泉水。泉水可不近啊！要在二百公尺以外才有。这对六十高龄的老大娘来说，是一件多么吃力的事！
    在这动乱的日子里，疯狂的敌机，随时随地在投扔炸弹。可恶的美国野兽，已经向这个不满五十户的小村，空袭了两次。在那火光冲天的小屋里，仿佛听到了婴儿在啼哭，左同志毫不犹豫地奔向那烟火弥漫的深处，迅速地抱起昏迷的孩子，跑了出来。
    不幸，左同志被强盗们发现了，俯冲的敌机又对他猛烈扫射。
    火仍在燃烧，他倒下去了。
    从四面八方跑来的老乡们把左同志和孩子救了出来。
    左同志伤口十分严重，子弹不仅打穿大腿，而且还有两三处严重的火伤。
    老乡们决定把左同志安排在朴老大娘的家里，临时紧急治疗。
    昏迷不醒的左同志，在老大娘无微不至的关怀下，过了四天，逐渐恢复了知觉。
    “我的阿妈尼，我的阿妈尼！”
    当左同志知道正是这位老大娘为他不分昼夜、不辞辛苦地提来凉水时，感动得伏在老大娘身上流下泪来。
    过了些时候，志愿军后方医院派来了一个担架，把他抬走了。
    左同志躺在担架上，紧握着老大娘的手，激动得哽咽地说：
    “我的妈妈！木而（注），谢谢！木而，谢谢！”
    “不，孩子！愿你早日痊愈，去打敌人！”
    朴老大娘拭去了压抑不住的泪水。
    他们走了。老大娘挥着手，一直目送他们到消失的时候。
    又过了一个来月。
    朴老大娘在腌咸菜，她忽然看到，前面有位志愿军从崎岖的山道向她飞奔过来。
    “阿妈尼！我的妈妈！”
    这正是左同志。
    “啊呀，我的孩子，你来了！”
    老大娘急忙从田园里出来，慈爱地拥抱着左同志。
    “让我看看！你的伤势怎样了？”
    左同志露出微笑，伸出胳膊和腿并用力在挥动，意思是它早已复原了。他们又热烈地拥抱起来。
    随后，左同志马上从土屋里拿出一把锹，在土屋旁掘起土来。
    朴老大娘，一时不知是怎么回事，只是凝视着。
    “哦呀，你在干什么呢！快坐下来息息！”
    老大娘猜到了左同志要为她掘水井，一定不要他这样做。
    左同志并没有听劝说，仍在掘着土。
    后来才知道，原来左同志是为了给老大娘掘一个水井，提前三天出院，跑到这里来的。
    左同志坚持不懈地掘着水井，第二天过晌，终于涌出泉水来了。
    左同志连忙搬着大石头，铺成一个整齐牢固的井圈。
    “阿妈尼！你这儿有水啦！”
    左同志掬了一瓢泉水递给了大娘。……
    第二天傍晚，左同志走了。可是，他替朴大娘掘水井的事，在人们中间传说着。
    停战以后，朴老大娘的土屋也已盖成瓦房了。
    这是根据朴老大娘的意见，在原地盖起来的新房子。这里虽距正村较远，有些不便，但因为左同志亲手掘的水井在这里，她坚决不肯搬走。
    老大娘的生活愈过愈幸福，对左同志的想念也愈来愈深。
    中国人民志愿军凯旋归国的消息传来了。老大娘从三里地外，每天到车站去欢送。
    老大娘把井水烧开盛在水罐里，包得紧紧的，带到车站上。怀着慈母心情的老大娘，到哪里去找左同志呢？但她并没有失望。
      “他们都是左同志，都是我的孩子，孩子们！请喝吧，这是你们用鲜血捍卫住的朝鲜的水，哪怕喝一口也好！”
    朴大娘淳朴地，殷勤地向志愿军敬着水。
    过了几天，开来一辆满载归国志愿军的列车。
    一个胸前挂着国旗勋章、军功章和其他金光灿烂纪念章的青年军人从车上跳下，在人丛中找来找去，像找什么亲人似的。
    忽然，这位青年军人在老大娘面前站了下来。
    老大娘也看到了他。这是多么突然的事啊！
    这个志愿军看出是朴老大娘，就猛烈伏在她的身上，喊道：
    “阿妈尼！阿妈尼！我的妈妈！”
    “我的孩子！你来了！”
    他们的热泪，禁不住地流下来了。
    “孩子呀！真没有想到！我当再也不能见到你了呢！”
    老大娘说着，就急忙倒出一碗水来。
    “这就是从你掘的水井里提上来的水，早就给你预备了，渴吗？哪怕喝一口也好。”
    左同志恭敬地接过了老大娘的水，喝了几口。然后，他从肩上取下军用水壶，又灌满了一壶。
    “见着它，就像见到朝鲜妈妈，就像见到朝鲜三千里锦绣江山一般，我要永远保存它！”
    左同志准备把这一壶水带回可爱的祖国。
    “我的孩子，今日一旦分别，什么时候才能再见呢？”
    老大娘接着又说：
    “我们的生活越来越美好，就在你那亲手掘出的水井旁已盖好了一栋瓦房。真想留你在我家过两天才好！”
    汽笛尖声地叫起来，火车蠕蠕地移动了。
    左同志和老大娘又一次紧紧地拥抱着。
    依依不舍的惜别深情，化作无法抑制的泪水。
    今天我们在欢送着亲爱的战友，但在两国人民心中燃烧的友情，一点也不会消失它的光彩，正如左同志所掘出的泉水一样，永流不息。
  〔注〕“木而”是朝鲜话的“水”。
