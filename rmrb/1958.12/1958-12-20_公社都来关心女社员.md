    The Commune Cares About Female Commune Members
    Yang Chao
    The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" points out the need to ensure necessary rest for women during pre-natal, post-natal, and menstrual periods. Such measures that show concern for the interests of the masses will surely be supported by the masses, further enhancing the production enthusiasm of female commune members, and promoting the commune's production.
    Why do pregnant women and women during menstruation need this special care? We must start with the physiological characteristics of women.
    Generally, women aged fourteen or fifteen and up to forty-five experience menstruation every twenty-five to thirty-five days. This is because about every month, one or two eggs mature in the ovaries, and the endometrium becomes soft and enlarged, preparing for the easy attachment of the conceived zygote (the fertilized egg after the union of sperm and egg) for its development into a fetus. However, if the egg is not fertilized, the endometrium sheds on its own, causing microvascular rupture and bleeding. The detached fragments of the uterine lining and blood are discharged from the body through the uterine cavity and vagina, which is menstruation.
    Although menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon, many women often feel unwell during this period: headaches, dizziness, abdominal pain, back pain, weak legs, and fatigue. Even if some people do not experience these symptoms, their body resistance is still weak, making them susceptible to infections. Because the shedding of the endometrium creates some wounds on the inner wall, and the pelvis is congested, and the cervix is also slightly dilated, coupled with the fact that menstrual blood is the best medium for bacteria to enter the uterus, it is necessary to pay attention to hygiene and proper rest during menstruation. Otherwise, it can easily lead to uterine infections, various gynecological diseases such as back pain, dizziness, abdominal pain, prolonged healing of uterine wall wounds, and excessive bleeding.
    In order to protect the health of female commune members, it is very necessary for the commune to stipulate that women during menstruation should not be assigned heavy or water-related work. Overly heavy work will affect the early healing of wounds on the inner wall of the uterus, causing excessive bleeding, as well as menstrual disorders, uterine prolapse, and infertility. Women should also avoid getting cold during menstruation. Cold stimulation can cause blood vessels to contract, hindering blood circulation, leading to sudden cessation of menstruation, abdominal pain, and menstrual irregularities. Therefore, women during menstruation should not stand in cold water to work.
    After becoming pregnant, women can participate in some light labor. Appropriate activity is also beneficial to the health of pregnant women and can speed up childbirth. However, heavy and lifting work should absolutely be avoided, so as to prevent uterine shock and stimulation that can cause contractions, leading to miscarriage or premature birth. Generally, pregnant women experience drowsiness, which is a physiological need for more rest. Pregnant women should be allowed adequate sleep time. With good rest and sufficient sleep, pregnant women will feel refreshed and complete their work well, while the fetus in the abdomen can also develop normally.
    Let us follow the spirit of the Party Central Committee's resolution, regularly care for the health of female commune members, and arrange appropriate labor according to their physiological characteristics!

    公社都来关心女社员
    杨超
    “关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出要保证妇女在产前产后和月经期内必要的休息。这种关心群众利益的措施，一定会得到群众的拥护，也一定会更加提高女社员们的生产积极性，推动了公社的生产。
    为什么孕妇和月经期间的妇女需要这些特殊照顾呢？得从妇女的生理特点谈起。
    一般十四、五岁以上、四十五岁以下的妇女，每隔二十五天至三十五天都要来一次月经。这是因为每经过约一个月的时间，卵巢里就会成熟一颗到两颗卵子，子宫内膜也随着变得松软肥大，准备给受胎的孕子（精子与卵子结合后的受精卵）容易附着而发育成胎儿。但是假如卵子没有受精，子宫内膜就自行剥落，并且发生微血管破裂的出血现象。剥落下来的子宫粘膜碎块和血液，通过子宫腔和阴道排出体外，便是月经。
    月经虽然是一种正常的生理现象，但是许多妇女在这个时期中常常会感到身体不适：头痛、头晕、肚子痛、腰酸、腿软和容易疲劳。即使有的人没有这些现象，身体抵抗力还是很弱，容易感染疾病。因为子宫内膜剥落时在内壁上造成了一些创伤，同时骨盆充血，子宫口也张大了一些，加以经血又是细菌钻进子宫里去的最好的媒介物，所以在月经期中必须注意清洁卫生和适当休息，否则容易使子宫感染疾病和发生腰酸、头晕、肚子痛、子宫壁创伤经久不愈和流血过多等各种妇女病。
    为了保护女社员的健康，公社规定在月经期中的妇女不给重活和水活做是很必要的。过重的活会影响子宫内壁创伤的早日愈合，造成流血过多，以及经血失调、子宫下坠和不孕等疾病。妇女在月经期间还不能受凉。冷的刺激会使血管收缩，妨碍血液流通，以致引起月经突然停止、肚子痛和月经不调等病。因此月经期间的妇女不能站在凉水里作活。
    妇女怀孕以后，参加一些轻便的劳动是可以的。适当的活动对孕妇的健康还有好处，到生小孩时也快些。但是绝对不能作重的和举高的工作，以免子宫受震动和刺激而收缩，造成流产或早产。一般孕妇都有昏昏思睡的现象，这是需要较多休息的一种生理要求。应该让孕妇有适当的睡眠时间。休息好、睡眠足，孕妇才会精神爽快，很好地完成工作，同时腹中的胎儿也能得到正常的发展。
    让我们遵循党中央决议的精神，经常地关心女社员的健康，根据她们的生理特点来安排适当的劳动吧！
