The Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range forest region, implementing the policy of simultaneous harvesting and renewal this year, and engaging in vigorous mass movements, has achieved comprehensive and leaping development in forestry production.

Currently, the Greater Khingan Range is covered in silver, roads and ice paths are clear and smooth, and the mud and mosquitoes of the mountain areas are no longer a problem, greatly improving timber production efficiency. Employees call winter the golden season. Now, tens of thousands of employees of Han, Mongolian, Daur, Korean, Hui and other ethnic groups are fighting in the golden season under the slogan of "Seizing every second, not giving up every millimeter." "Production peak days" exceeding daily output by about double have been constantly appearing in various forestry bureaus. By December 11, they had produced 2.8 million cubic meters of timber, exceeding the original state plan by 40%. They will present the New Year's Day of 1959 with the action of completing 3.2 million cubic meters of timber.

At the beginning of the year, when the task of producing 2 million cubic meters of timber was determined, some people were afraid of not being able to complete it. Under the inspiration of the General Line and the strong leadership of the Party, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, the political and ideological awareness of the employees has been greatly improved, constantly breaking down right-leaning conservative ideas and complacency, and greatly liberating the mind. Everyone is united and full of energy. The Forestry Administration Party Committee especially seized the experience of the Itu River Forestry Bureau in organizing mass production peak days and vigorously promoted it; it also seized the technical innovation of turning timber transport trucks into trains, driving the mass technical revolution movement in various work types. Therefore, the work efficiency of many employees has increased by one time, several times, or even dozens of times. Following the production leap forward in the spring, measures were taken in the summer to break the old concept of taking a break in the rainy season. The workers put forward the slogan "Work hard in heavy rain, work harder in light rain, and work especially hard when there is no rain," overcoming the difficulties of the rainy season. The second and third quarters produced 1.15 million cubic meters of timber, an increase of one time compared with the same period last year.

Most of the timber produced this year has been continuously transported to industrial and agricultural production and construction units in the capital, Northeast, North China, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shanghai, and Fujian. A lot of good timber was given priority to support the construction of Baotou Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, and thousands of small steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces, national defense construction, and the construction in the capital to welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day. A large number of mine pillars supported the underground production of more than ten coal mines, iron mines, and phosphate mines such as Fushun, Kailuan, Datong, Longyan, and Jinping. In the fourth quarter alone, more than 80,000 cubic meters of mine pillars were transported to support the production leap forward of more than ten coal mines. Many solid sleepers supported the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Baotou-Lanzhou, Beijing-Guangzhou, and Beijing-Pukou railway double tracks; large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Ming Tombs Reservoir, Gangnan Reservoir, and Qingtongxia, as well as thousands of small hydropower stations and small farmland water conservancy and irrigation projects have all received support from the timber of the Greater Khingan Range.

    林区进入黄金季节了
    大量生产木材支援祖国建设
    本报讯  内蒙古大兴安岭林区，今年贯彻执行采伐与更新同时并举的方针，大搞群众运动，使林业生产获得全面的飞跃发展。
    目前，大兴安岭已披上皑皑银装，公路和冰道明净平整，山场泥泞和蚊虻叮咬难不住人了，木材生产效率大大提高。职工们把冬天称为黄金季节。现在数万名汉、蒙古、达斡尔、朝鲜、回等族职工正在“分秒必争、分厘不让”的口号下，大战黄金季节。各林业局超过平日产量一倍左右的“生产高峰日”不断出现。到12月11日止，已生产木材二百八十万立方公尺，超过原订国家计划40％。他们要以完成三百二十万立方公尺木材的行动向1959年元旦献礼。
    年初确定今年生产木材二百万立方公尺的任务时，有些人怕完不成。在总路线的鼓舞和党的坚强领导下，坚持了政治挂帅，职工们政治思想觉悟大大提高，不断地破除右倾保守思想和自满情绪，思想大解放，大家团结一致，干劲冲天。林业管理局党委特别抓住伊图里河林业局组织群众性的生产高峰日的经验，大力推广；又抓住运材汽车列车化这一技术革新，带动各工种掀起群众性的技术革命运动。因此，许多职工的工作效率提高一倍、数倍乃至数十倍。继春天的生产跃进之后，夏天又及时采取措施，打破了雨季要歇一歇的陈旧观念，工人们提出“大雨小干，小雨大干，无雨特干”的口号，战胜了雨季的困难。二、三季度生产了一百一十五万立方公尺木材，比去年同期提高一倍。
    今年生产的大部分木材，已源源运往首都、东北、华北和青海、宁夏、上海、福建等地的工农业生产建设单位。很多好木材特别尽先运送，支援了包钢、鞍山和其他成千的小炼钢、炼铁炉的建设和国防建设以及首都迎接国庆十周年的建筑。大批矿柱支援了抚顺、开滦、大同、龙烟、锦屏等十余个煤矿、铁矿和磷矿的坑下生产，仅第四季度就运了八万多立方公尺矿柱支援十余个煤矿的生产大跃进。不少坚实的枕木支援了兰新、包兰路和京广、京浦路复线的修筑；十三陵水库、岗南水库和青铜峡等大型水利工程以及成千的小型水电站、小型农田水利灌溉工程都得到了大兴安岭的木材的支援。（附图片）
