Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th December. Our correspondent Peng Di reports: The British government's decision to allow foreigners outside the Sterling Area to exchange pounds for dollars or other currencies has no practical significance for these foreigners, as they could previously exchange their pounds on the black market at rates only a few points lower than the official rate. It seems that the main purpose of this decision is to strengthen the position of the pound and throw it into the trade war with other European countries, especially France and West Germany.

With the imminent establishment of the European "Common Market" and the risk of Britain being driven out of the European market, Britain has taken this recent measure. The current hope is to encourage foreigners to buy more British goods, with the ultimate goal of gradually making the pound a more widely used means of payment in international trade, allowing Britain to penetrate non-Sterling areas, mainly the European continent.

Britain's action was taken after long consideration, which became clearer during the Commonwealth Economic Conference in Montreal in September and the subsequent International Monetary Fund meeting in New Delhi. However, Britain accelerated this action because it failed to persuade the continental European countries to accept its proposed "Free Trade Area" plan led by Britain.

However, Britain's action was met with simultaneous countermeasures from the continental countries – France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Norway, and Denmark – which also announced that their currencies could be freely exchanged for foreign currencies. The French government even sharply devalued the franc at the expense of the French people's living standards to cope with the British challenge and France's obligations in the West European "Common Market," and to make its export goods more competitive. In London, it is believed that the French government's announcement that 90% of its foreign trade is free from restrictions shows France's determination to participate in the trade war on the one hand and to refuse further negotiations on the "Free Trade Area" issue on the other. France's practice of making 90% of its foreign trade free from restrictions deprives Britain of any reason to continue to demand "Free Trade Area" negotiations.

France could not have taken all these measures without the support of West Germany. The trade war between France and Britain is also a trade war between West Germany and Britain.

France's dollar reserves are less than $200 million. However, these dollar reserves, when added to West Germany's $4 billion reserves, are much larger than Britain's. Britain's dollar reserves in November were $3.215 billion.

Britain is taking a great risk by throwing the pound into the trade war. It is generally expected that the pound's position may initially appear stronger than before due to the adoption of freely convertible measures. However, at the same time, the pound is now more susceptible to speculation and credit transfers than before. If trade turns against Britain, the run on the pound will be more severe than before, and Britain's gold and dollar reserves are far from sufficient to withstand this pressure. In this case, the British government will have to re-implement tighter credit controls and other restrictive policies domestically, at the expense of production, employment, and the people's living standards, in order to protect the pound abroad. The immediate consequence of these new measures is to open the door for more American goods to enter the Sterling Area.

### 怕被赶出欧洲市场  想要打败竞争对手  英国冒险决定英镑自由兑换

    怕被赶出欧洲市场  想要打败竞争对手
    英国冒险决定英镑自由兑换
    新华社伦敦29日电  本社记者彭迪报道：英国政府作出的允许英镑地区以外的外国人用英镑兑换美元或者兑换其它国家货币的决定，对这些外国人没有什么实际意义，因为他们以前就能够在黑市兑换他们的英镑，比率只比官价少几分。看来这个决定的主要目的是要加强英镑的地位，把英镑投入同其它欧洲国家、特别是法国和西德进行的贸易战。
    由于欧洲“共同市场”马上要成立，而英国有被赶出欧洲市场的危险，因此英国便采取最近这项措施，目前的希望是鼓励外国人多买英国商品，最后的目的则是使英镑逐渐成为国际贸易支付的更广泛的手段，使英国渗入非英镑地区，主要是欧洲大陆。
    英国的这个行动是经过长期考虑的，今年9月，在英联邦国家蒙特利尔经济会议期间和后来的新德里国际货币基金组织会议期间，更加清楚地表明了这一点。但是由于英国没有能够说服欧洲大陆的国家接受英国提出的关于由英国领导的“自由贸易区”的计划，英国才加速采取这个行动。
    但是英国的行动遇到了大陆国家——法国、西德、意大利、比利时、挪威和丹麦——同时采取的反措施，它们也宣布，它们的货币可以自由兑换外币。法国政府甚至于在牺牲法国人民生活水平的情况下，使法郎急剧贬值，以应付英国的挑战和法国在西欧“共同市场”里所承担的义务，并且使它的出口商品有更大的竞争能力。在伦敦有人认为，法国政府宣布它的对外贸易有90％不受限额限制这一点，表明法国决心一方面参加贸易战，另方面拒绝就“自由贸易区”问题举行进一步谈判。法国使它的对外贸易的90％不受限额限制的做法使英国不再有理由继续要求举行“自由贸易区”谈判了。
    法国不可能在没有西德支持的情况下采取这一切措施。法国和英国之间的贸易战也是西德和英国之间的贸易战。
    法国的美元储备只有不足二亿美元。但是，这些美元储备如果加上西德的四十亿美元的储备，那就比英国的储备多得多了。英国的美元储备在11月份是三十二亿一千五百万美元。
    英国把英镑投入贸易战是冒着极大的风险的。人们普遍预料，由于采取可以自由兑换的措施，英镑的地位在开头看来可能比以前巩固。但是同时英镑现在就比以前更容易受投机和信用转移的影响。假如贸易转而对英国不利，英镑的挤兑情况就要比以前更加严重，而英国的黄金和美元储备远不够多，受不了这种压力。在这种情况下，英国政府将不得不在牺牲生产、就业和人民的生活水平的情况下，在国内重新采取加紧信用控制和其他限制政策，以保护国外的英镑。这种新措施的立即后果是，为更多的美国货进入英镑地区打开了大门。
