    Long Live, the Genius of the Chinese Workers
    By Our Correspondent Tian Lin

    Rare Flowers and Exotic Plants, a Garden Full of Spring Colors

    1958, this year that is about to pass, will be recorded in our country's history in the largest of fonts. In this year, the Chinese workers, who had their ideological awareness raised through the Rectification Movement, were inspired by the slogan of catching up with and surpassing Britain in fifteen years and by the Great Leap Forward on the agricultural front. They launched a technical revolution and a cultural revolution, creating a situation where "one day equals twenty years." In this year, Chinese workers and the vast masses who newly joined the ranks of industry, with heroic spirit and contempt for difficulties, marched toward science and technology, proposed approximately ten million technical innovation projects, and successfully trial-produced approximately ten thousand new products. In the past, we had never seen cars with Chinese characters on them, but this year, more than ten new types of cars with Chinese characters like "Dongfeng," "Hongqi," and "Jinggangshan" suddenly appeared on our land. Even airplanes, products requiring high technology, were suddenly produced in several types, such as "Beijing No. 1" and "Shenyang No. 1." Also, internal combustion locomotives, electric locomotives, ocean-going ships, televisions, watches, cameras, and other "high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge" products that we dared not even think about in the past were successively created throughout the country this year. This year, our country's industrial front is truly full of colorful flowers and a garden brimming with spring.

    For the sake of the "steel commander" taking command and for the sake of 1,070, during this year's vigorous mass steelmaking campaign, new technologies and new creations emerged like bamboo shoots after rain. Workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created the advanced "three-tap steelmaking method," increasing steel production by more than 40%. Employees of the Metallurgical Ministry's Iron and Steel Research Institute even produced a new steel grade, "Steel Commander 80," without using nickel, catching up with America's trump card steel—nickel-containing W.S.S.T-1 low-alloy high-strength steel. Workers in Beijing and Jinxi cooperated and actually directly rolled molten steel into steel plates.

    "Turn iron into steel," "turn steel into material," and "turn material into tools"—these urgent demands motivated countless workers to search for ingenious plans. In the machinery industry, the past logic was that without large equipment, large machines could not be made, but this year, factories without large equipment insisted on producing large machines. They said, "A small hen can lay large eggs" and "Ants can gnaw bones." Many machine factories combined light and convenient small machine tools or assembled them like building blocks to produce many large machines. Roller bearings, which were considered mysterious in the past, were actually hammered out by the masses using hammers, drills, and earthen furnaces, greatly improving the production efficiency of tens of millions of agricultural tools and transportation vehicles. Tractors, the darlings nicknamed "iron oxen" by farmers, were rivaled this year by the rope-traction machines created in Jiangsu.

    This rising star in the world, the chemical industry, was also challenged by our country's workers this year. Reactive dyes, this treasure that never fades and can dye all kinds of fiber fabrics, are currently only produced in Britain, Switzerland, and West Germany, but we successfully trial-produced many kinds in just a few months this year. This year, locally made pesticides and fertilizers have entered the halls of fame, making a big splash in the fields.

    Electricity, this invisible and inaudible thing, has always been shrouded in a mysterious veil in front of the masses. However, this year, the vast masses, lacking "cultural" equipment, reached out boldly and captured it. They set up power stations everywhere. Lacking power generation equipment, those unknown blacksmiths, carpenters, and tilers, like the legendary Lu Ban, were ingenious and created all kinds of power generation equipment and materials, hanging strings of night pearls in the countryside and freeing a large number of laborers from grinding stones and mills.

    When grinding flour, both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, people make flour before removing bran, but the flour workers in Jinan carried out a revolution, first removing the skin and then making flour, increasing the flour yield by 5% while improving the quality of the flour.

    Without steel rails, railways cannot be built. In the past, almost no one doubted this truth. However, the people of Yuxian County, Shanxi, opened up this narrow vision for us and created an earthen railway. They used molten iron to cast iron rails and modified road rollers into locomotives. This creation opened up a way for railways to walk on two legs. On the highways, long snakes like trains appeared this year, with one truck towing up to fifty trailers. To bring out the efficiency of cars to such a high degree is truly an unprecedented miracle in automotive history!

    Aren't these countless inventions and creations, which cannot be fully written down, watered by the sweat and intelligence of our country's workers? Aren't they the crystallization of the genius of our country's workers? We are proud, proud of the genius of our country's workers, proud that we have the wise and correct leadership of the Party, and proud of our socialist system!

    Lofty Aspirations, Diligent Study and Hard Training

    Do you want to know how miracles are created? Do you want to understand the secret of how ordinary Chinese workers shone so brilliantly this year? Please listen to a conversation that took place at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in March of this year!

    "Last year, we already changed from single-tap steelmaking to double-tap steelmaking, increasing steel production by nearly double. We have reached the top of production. There is nothing more we can do!"

    "Since single-tap steelmaking can be changed to double-tap steelmaking, can we find a way to change double-tap steelmaking to three-tap steelmaking?"

    Listen, what heroic words these are! It was nothing other than these heroic words that opened up the treasure house of wisdom of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's employees. It was they that enabled the three-tap steelmaking to finally be realized after overcoming many difficulties. This is a huge victory! It is a victory for the workers' genius and wisdom, but even more so a victory for the soaring heroism and the wise and correct guiding ideology of the Party.

    Here, there is also such a story: diligent study and hard training can produce champions. There was a young metal inspection worker, Zhou Nanxing from Wuxi City, who had rich practical experience and could accurately identify more than sixty kinds of steel from the various sparks generated by metal friction. He wanted to write a book to help metal inspection workers across the country master the technology. However, he had only finished one year of junior high school and had little education, so some people ridiculed him for "a toad wanting to eat swan meat." Retreat? No! He received the enthusiastic support of the Party branch secretary and replied decisively. He learned Chinese, Russian, and even painting to draw those dozens of kinds of sparks that have only tiny differences, are fleeting, and cannot even be photographed by photographers. Not knowing how many sleepless nights he endured, he revised the manuscript over and over again, tearing up the drafts ten, twenty, thirty times. As a result, he finally wrote three books, including "On-Site Inspection Method of Metal Sparks," which perfectly integrated scientific theory and practical production experience.

    Lofty aspirations, breaking superstitions, diligent study and hard training—these are not all the secrets to the Chinese workers' brilliance and creation of miracles this year. There is also the most important point, which is called the mass line. Please look at Feng Chong's speech from the Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Metallurgical Ministry at the National Youth Activists in Socialist Construction Conference in November about how "Steel Commander 80" could be born this year. He said that because they lacked materials and did not have time to look them up, they consulted with metallurgical workers and then held several "Zhuge Liang Meetings," so they finally developed the new steel grade under the condition of resolutely not using nickel based on our country's relatively limited nickel resources.

    Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain—Hear My Summons

    China is an ancient civilization in the world. Our excellent ancestors once contributed the inventions of gunpowder, the compass, papermaking, and printing to mankind. In the history of textiles, architecture, metallurgy, and shipbuilding, our ancestors also shone with genius. As far back as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods two thousand five hundred years ago, our ancestors knew how to make steel. During the reign of Emperor Zhao of the Han Dynasty, our clever spinning girls invented the jacquard loom for weaving brocade. During the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang (200 B.C.), our ancestors discovered that coal could be used as fuel near Nanchang, Jiangxi, while Europe did not know how to use coal until before the 14th century.

    The Chinese people are the descendants of these genius people. We are better than our predecessors and have inherited a legacy. Although due to imperialist aggression and the corruption of the rulers of old China, we are more than a hundred years behind the developed capitalist countries, we can still surpass them. We have the confidence to make the flowers of our motherland's culture bloom even more brilliantly and beautifully. British Archdeacon Johnson recently said in a Christmas speech that "a new era has emerged in the East." He is right. Socialist countries have indeed opened up a new era in history. We will, together with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, capture all the fortresses of world metallurgical technology, make "high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge" products a complete success, and let the flowers of atomic energy bloom all over China. We will have the wind and clouds listen to our summons, and thunder and rain be dispatched by us.

    We live in the era of the great Mao Zedong. As long as we thoroughly break superstitions and combine the spirit of seeking truth from facts with soaring drive, we will be able to reach the highest peak of world science and culture and realize the leap of mankind. Of course, there is still a difficult road ahead of us, and there are still many thorns, but what is there to worry about? We are the rising sun. Continue to move forward! Let us hoist our sails, ride the east wind, and sail a thousand miles a day towards this beautiful future.

    万岁，天才的中国工人
    本报记者  田林
    奇花异草  春色满园
    1958年，这即将过去的一年，它将以头号大字载入我国的史册。在这一年，经过整风运动提高了思想觉悟的中国工人，为十五年赶上并超过英国的口号所鼓舞，为农业战线上的大跃进所鼓舞，开展技术革命和文化革命，创造了“一天等于二十年”的局面。在这一年，中国工人和新参加到工业行列里来的广大群众，以豪迈的气概，蔑视困难，向科学技术进军，提出了约一千万件技术革新的项目，试制成功了约十万种新产品。过去我们从来没有看见过刻中国字的轿车，而今年，突然就在我们的国土上涌现出了十多种刻着“东风”、“红旗”、“井冈山”等中国字样的新式轿车。就是飞机这种需要高度技术的产品，今年，也一下子就制出了“北京一号”、“沈阳一号”等好几种。还有内燃机车、电气机车、远洋轮船、电视机、手表、照相机等等过去我们不敢问津的属于“高大精尖”的产品，今年都相继不断的在全国各地创造出来。今年，我国的工业战线真是千红万紫，春色满园。
    为了钢帅升帐，为了一○七○，在今年如火如荼的全民炼钢运动中，新技术和新创造像雨后春笋般出现。太原钢铁厂的工人创造了先进的“三槽出钢法”，把钢产量提高了40％多。冶金部钢铁研究院的职工竟然在不用镍的条件下，炼出了新钢种“钢帅80”，赶上了美国王牌钢——含镍的W．S．S．T—1低合金高强度钢。北京和锦西的工人合作，居然让熔融的钢水直接就轧成了钢板。
    “要铁成钢”、“要钢成材”、“要材成器”这些迫切的要求啊，激励着多少工人去寻找锦囊妙计。在机械工业中，过去的逻辑是没有大设备就不能作大机器，但是在今年，没有大设备的工厂却偏偏要生产大机器。他们说：“小母鸡可以生大蛋”、“蚂蚁能够啃骨头”。许多机器厂就这样把轻便的小机床组合起来或像积木一样搭起来，做出了许许多多的大机器。滚珠轴承，这在过去被认为是神秘的东西，可是，群众竟然用铁锤、钻子和土炉把它砸了出来，使几千万件农具和交通工具大大提高了生产效率。拖拉机，这个被农民昵称为“铁牛”的宠儿，人们没想到今年江苏创造的绳索牵引机，也可以和它比美。
    化学工业这世界上的后起之秀，今年我国工人也和它宣了战。活性染料，这永不褪色，能染一切纤维织物的珍宝，目前只有英国、瑞士和西德才能生产，而我们在今年短短的几个月中，就试制成功很多种。今年，各地制造的土农药、土化肥都登堂入室，在农田里大出风头。
    电，这视而不见，听而不闻的东西，过去在群众面前，一直罩着神秘的面纱。然而，今年，缺乏“文化”装备的广大群众，却伸出大胆的手把她俘虏了。他们到处办电站。没有发电设备，那些不知名的铁匠、木匠和瓦匠，像传说中的鲁班一样，心灵手巧，作出各式各样的发电设备和器材，为农村挂上了一串一串的夜明珠，把大批的劳动力从碾台上和磨台上解放了出来。
    磨面粉，古今中外都是先制粉后去麸，但是济南的制粉工人却闹革命，来了个先去皮后制粉，把出粉率提高了5％，而面粉的质量比过去还好。
    没有钢轨就不能建铁路，这在过去几乎是没有人怀疑过的真理。可是，山西盂县的人民，给我们打开了这狭隘的眼界，创作了一条土铁路。他们用铁水来浇铸铁轨，用压路机改装成机车。他们的这一创作为铁路用两条腿走路开辟了途径。在公路上，今年出现了像火车一样的长蛇，一辆卡车最高拖到了五十辆挂车。把汽车效率发挥到如此高度，真是汽车史上闻所未闻的奇迹！
    这些数不清写不完的发明创造，难道不是我国工人用自己的汗珠和聪明才智浇灌出来的吗？难道不是我国工人的天才的结晶吗？我们自豪，为我国工人的天才自豪，为我们有英明正确的党的领导而自豪，为我们的社会主义制度而自豪！
    壮志凌云  勤修苦炼
    要知道奇迹是怎样创造出来的吗？要了解平凡的中国工人在今年如此天才焕发的秘密吗？请先听一听今年3月在太原钢铁厂里的一段对话吧！
    “我们去年已经改单槽出钢为双槽出钢，把钢产量提高了将近一倍。增产到顶了，现在再不能有所作为了！”
    “既然单槽出钢能改双槽出钢，那么，双槽出钢能不能想办法再改为三槽出钢呢？”
    请听，这是何等豪壮的话啊！不是别的，就是这几句豪壮的话，就是它把太原钢铁厂职工们的智慧的宝库打开了。就是它使三槽出钢在战胜许许多多困难以后终于实现了。这是个巨大的胜利！是工人们天才和智慧的胜利，更是壮志凌云的英雄气概和党的英明正确的指导思想的胜利。
    在这里，也有这样一个故事：勤学苦炼可以出状元。有一个青年金属检查工人，无锡市的周南兴，他有丰富的实际经验，能够从金属摩擦所发生的各种火花里面，准确地识别六十多种钢材。他想写一本书来帮助全国的金属检查工掌握技术。然而，他只念过一年初中，文化很低，所以有人讪笑他“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”。退却吗？不！他得到党支部书记的热情支持，斩钉截铁地作了答复。他学中文，学俄文，还学绘画来画那些只有微小区别，而又是转瞬即逝，连摄影师都拍不下来的几十种火花。不知道熬过了多少个不眠的夜晚，他一遍一遍地改稿子，十遍、二十遍、三十遍地撕掉草图，结果，终于写成了“金属火花现场检查法”等三本书，使科学理论和实际生产经验作到了完满的融合。
    壮志凌云、破除迷信、勤学苦炼，这些还不是今年中国工人天才焕发，创造奇迹的全部秘密，还有最重要的一条，它叫作必须走群众路线。请看一看11月全国青年建设社会主义积极分子大会上，冶金部钢铁研究院冯冲关于“钢帅80”能够在今年诞生的发言吧。他说，因为没有资料，也来不及去查资料，他们就和冶金工人们商量，后来又几次召开“诸葛亮会”，所以他们终于根据我国镍比较缺乏的情况坚决在不用镍的条件下，把新钢种炼了出来。
    风云雷雨  听我呼唤
    中国是世界上的文明古国，我们优秀的祖先曾经为人类贡献过火药、指南针、造纸术和印刷术的发明，在世界的纺织、建筑、冶金、造船等历史上，我们的祖先也闪耀过天才的光辉。远在二千五百年前的春秋战国时期，我们的祖先就会炼钢了。在汉昭帝时，我们聪明的纺娘就发明了织花绫的提花机。在秦始皇时（公元前二百年）我们的祖先就在江西南昌附近，发现煤可以作燃料，而欧洲则在十四世纪以前还不知道用煤。
    我国人民就是这些天才人民的子孙。我们是青出于蓝，一脉相承。虽然由于帝国主义的侵略，和旧中国统治者的腐败，我们比发达的资本主义国家落后了一百多年，但是，后来可以居上。我们有信心让祖国文化的花朵开得更加灿烂和鲜艳。英国的约翰逊教长最近在圣诞节讲话中说：“东方出现了新纪元”。他说得不错。社会主义国家确实开辟了历史的新纪元。我们将同苏联及其他兄弟国家一道攻占世界冶金技术的全部堡垒，使“高大精尖”满堂红，并让原子能的鲜花开遍全中国，我们要风云听我们呼唤，雷雨由我们差遣。
    我们生活在伟大毛泽东的时代，只要我们彻底破除迷信，把实事求是的精神和冲天干劲结合起来，我们就将能登上世界科学文化的最高峰，实现人类的飞跃。诚然，我们面前还有一段艰苦的路程，也还有许多荆棘，但是，耽心什么呢？我们是旭日东升。继续前进吧！让我们挂起征帆，乘着东风，一日千里地向着这锦绣似的未来驶去吧。
