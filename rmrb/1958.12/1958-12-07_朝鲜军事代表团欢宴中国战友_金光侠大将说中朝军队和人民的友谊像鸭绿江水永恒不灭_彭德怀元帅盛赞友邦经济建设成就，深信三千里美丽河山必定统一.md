Xinhua News Agency, 6th — The Minister of National Defense of Korea and head of the military delegation, General Kim Kwang-hyup, held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to thank the Chinese comrades for the warm reception and welcome given to the delegation during its visit to China.

    Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai attended the banquet.

    In his speech at the banquet, General Kim Kwang-hyup first expressed his heartfelt thanks on behalf of the delegation to the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Ministry of National Defense for the warm welcome and meticulous care given to the delegation.

    In his speech, General Kim Kwang-hyup warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. He also highly praised the achievements made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and in military training. General Kim Kwang-hyup said that the warm welcome of the fraternal Chinese people and army once again showed that the friendship and unity between our two peoples, cemented with blood, is unbreakable. He said that the great unity and friendship between our two peoples and armies is built on the basis of ever-victorious Marxism-Leninism, so our friendship and unity, like the Yalu River flowing between our two countries, is continuous and eternal.

    General Kim Kwang-hyup said that our two peoples' common enemy, the American imperialists, disregarding the shameful lessons of their disastrous defeat in the Korean War, continue to occupy South Korea and Taiwan. However, no matter what tricks the American imperialists play, their aggressive ambitions will not be realized. The Korean and Chinese peoples and armies will surely shatter any provocative schemes of the American aggressors and will surely accomplish the sacred task of peaceful reunification of Korea and liberation of Taiwan.

    General Kim Kwang-hyup concluded by saying: "There is nothing in the world more noble than the internationalist friendship and unity between our Korean and Chinese peoples and armies, cemented with blood.

    The Korean people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army will, as in the past, continue to be loyal to their proletarian internationalist obligations and cherish and protect the brotherly unity between our two peoples and armies as they would the pupils of their eyes, and will forever advance together with our Chinese friends."

    Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he once again expressed his deep gratitude to all the comrades of the Korean military delegation headed by General Kim Kwang-hyup, and asked the delegation to convey the most sincere friendship and love of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean people and all the comrades of the People's Army.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai said: "Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the hardworking and brave Korean people are carrying out socialist construction with the spirit of riding the Chollima and at a rapid pace. We are very pleased to see that in the short period since the war, the Korean people have overcome countless difficulties, rapidly restored and developed the national economy, and successfully completed the Three-Year Plan. They are currently working hard to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and have already made great achievements... This is a victory for the Korean people, and also a victory for the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the socialist camp."

    Marshal Peng Dehuai said: "We have not forgotten in the slightest that the American imperialist aggressors are still occupying South Korea and our territory of Taiwan, and are openly carrying out the conspiracy to create 'two Chinas,' which is absolutely unacceptable to the people of China and Korea. China's territory of Taiwan must be liberated, and the three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified. The American imperialist troops must withdraw from southern Korea and China's territory of Taiwan. This is the common historical task of our two peoples."

    Invited to attend this evening's banquet were Senior General Gan Siqi, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Li Juikui, Senior General Li Zhimin, Senior General Chen Shiqu, Senior General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Wu Faxian of the Air Force, Vice Admiral Zhou Xihan of the Navy, and other generals of various services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and officers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing, army representatives attending the Second National Congress of Active Builders of Socialist Construction for Youth, as well as former officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, combat heroes, and members of cultural troupes.

    Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, and Korean Ambassador to China Li Yonghao also attended this evening's banquet.

    All members of the Hungarian military delegation headed by Minister of Defense Lieutenant General Revis and military attaches from various countries to China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    All distinguished guests of the Korean military delegation returned to Beijing by special plane this morning from Nanjing, accompanied by Lieutenant General Li Zhimin, representative of our Ministry of National Defense, and others. Prior to this, the delegation visited Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places.

    国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅出席了宴会。
    金光侠大将在宴会上讲话中，首先以代表团的名义向给予代表团热烈的欢迎和无微不至的关怀的中国共产党、中国政府和国防部表示衷心的感谢。
    金光侠大将在讲话中热烈地称赞了中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就，他对中国人民解放军在保卫祖国和军事训练中所取得的成就，也给予了很高的评价。金光侠大将说，兄弟的中国人民和军队对我们的热烈欢迎，再一次显示了我们两国人民以鲜血凝成的友谊团结是牢不可破的。他说，我们两国人民和军队之间伟大的团结和友谊，是建立在百战百胜的马克思列宁主义的基础上，因此我们的友谊和团结就像奔流在我们两国边界上的鸭绿江那样川流不息、永恒不灭的。
    金光侠大将说，我们两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义者，不顾在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的可耻教训，继续盘踞南朝鲜和台湾。但是，不管美帝国主义玩弄任何手段，它的侵略野心是得不到实现的。朝中两国人民和军队一定会粉碎美国侵略者的任何挑衅策划，一定会完成和平统一朝鲜和解放台湾的神圣任务。
    金光侠大将最后说：“世界上再没有什么东西会比我们朝中两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的国际主义友谊和团结更加高贵了。
    朝鲜人民和人民军官兵仍将像过去一样，继续忠诚于无产阶级国际主义义务，像对待自己的眼珠那样去珍惜和保护我们两国人民与军队之间的兄弟般的团结，永远同中国朋友们一道前进。”
    彭德怀元帅在宴会上讲了话，他代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体官兵再一次向以金光侠大将为首的朝鲜军事代表团全体同志表示深深的感谢，并请代表团把中国人民和中国人民解放军最诚挚的友情和热爱，带给朝鲜人民和人民军的全体同志。
    彭德怀元帅说：“勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，正以跨上千里马的气概和飞快的速度，进行着社会主义建设。我们很高兴地看到，朝鲜人民在战后短短的时期中，克服了无数的困难，迅速地恢复和发展了国民经济，胜利地完成了三年计划。目前正为争取提前完成第一个五年计划而紧张地奋斗，并且已经取得了巨大的成就。……这是朝鲜人民的胜利，也是中国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民的胜利。” 
    彭德怀元帅说：“我们丝毫也没有忘记，美帝国主义侵略者，目前还霸占着南朝鲜，还霸占着我国的领土台湾，并且公开进行制造‘两个中国’的阴谋，这是中朝两国人民所绝对不能容许的。中国的领土台湾一定要解放，朝鲜三千里美丽河山一定要统一，美帝国主义军队必须从朝鲜南部和中国的领土台湾撤出去，这是我们两国人民共同的历史任务。”
    应邀出席今晚宴会的有甘泗淇上将、彭绍辉上将、李聚奎上将、李志民上将、陈士榘上将、刘志坚上将、萧向荣中将、吴法宪空军中将、周希汉海军中将等中国人民解放军各军种兵种将领和驻京陆、海、空军军官，出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的军队代表，以及前志愿军官兵、战斗英雄、文工团员等。
