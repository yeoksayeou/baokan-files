    Ode to the Ganoderma Lucidum of Huangshan Mountain
    Guo Moruo
    The Ganoderma lucidum grows on the Lion Peak of Huangshan Mountain, and it was picked by a medicinal farmer, Old Yang. The plant is like red coral, dazzlingly bright. The branches and stems are covered with various colored mottles. Experts have identified it as meat ganoderma, saying it is a unique product among ganoderma.
    The ancients regarded ganoderma as an auspicious omen, probably because it was rare. During the Great Leap Forward, everyone created miracles, so mountains, rivers, plants, and trees also competed to offer auspicious signs. The ganoderma on Lion Peak is more than sixty feet above the ground. Who is the Ganoderma-picking immortal? It is the old medicinal farmer, surnamed Yang, from Huangshan. As red as coral, with a brilliant luster, confirmed to be the most precious of the meat ganoderma. Considering it an auspicious sign is not surprising, as auspicious signs are everywhere now.
    The ganoderma is forty-nine centimeters tall,
    The branches and stems have mottles everywhere.
    The roots are like lacquer, dazzling to the eye,
    Milky white, green, interspersed with purple and gold.
    The appearance of ganoderma is truly because of the grass,
    Even among beasts, the giraffe has already emerged. (Note)
    Plants, trees, insects, and fish are all liberated,
    Celebrating the eternal spring of socialism.

Note: Kirin, that is, giraffe, now exists in the Beijing Zoo.

    咏黄山灵芝草
    郭沫若
    黄山狮子峰出灵芝草，为药农杨老采获。株如红珊瑚，光彩夺目。枝茎等部复呈各色斑纹。专家定为肉芝，云是芝中异品。
    古人视芝为祥瑞，盖以其罕遇也，大跃进中，人人创生奇迹，故山川草木亦争献瑞呈祥。狮子峰头灵芝草，离地六十多丈高。采芝仙人究为谁？黄山药农杨姓老。赤如珊瑚有光辉，定为肉芝最珍贵。视为祥瑞不足奇，如今遍地皆祥瑞。
    芝高四十九公分，
    枝茎处处有斑纹。
    根部如髹光夺目，
    乳白青绿间紫金。
    出现灵芝实草因，
    兽中早已出麒麟。（注）
    草木虫鱼同解放，
    社会主义庆长春。注：麒麟，即长颈鹿，今北京动物园
      有之。
