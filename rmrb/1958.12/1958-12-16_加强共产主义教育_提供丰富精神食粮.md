Strengthen Communist Education Provide Rich Spiritual Food
Communist Talents Emerge in Large Numbers

    A strong material and technical base and a high level of people's awareness are the main conditions for the transition to communism. Therefore, the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for advancing towards communism stipulates that the primary task in the fields of culture and education is to strengthen communist education for all the people, and to pay special attention to educating the second generation in the spirit of communism, to bring schools closer to life, to combine education with production, to master the scientific knowledge accumulated by mankind, and to overcome the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness.

    The world's first artificial satellite, the first atomic power station, the first atomic icebreaker, the largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, and other scientific miracles fully demonstrate the brilliant achievements the Soviet Union has made in cultivating talent. Whether in terms of quantity or quality, the Soviet Union has become the world leader in cultivating specialized talent. Currently, Soviet universities are training almost twice as many engineers as the United States. At present, the Soviet Union has more than four million university students, three times more than the total number of university students in Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy combined.

    However, the Soviet people are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. In the next seven years, the entire national education system in the Soviet Union will undergo fundamental reforms. The purpose of this reform is to overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between education and life, to cultivate young people to participate in practical life and beneficial labor, and to make them deeply respect the principles of socialist society.

Vigorously Carry Out Educational Reform

    In the next seven years, an important measure of the Soviet Union's educational reform is to divide secondary education into two stages: the first stage is eight-year compulsory education, and the second stage is different types of urban and rural secondary labor schools. The development of Soviet universities will follow the path of night schools and correspondence schools, and universities should first enroll young people with actual work experience. Most university students will study part-time for the first two or three years, or the last two or three years. In addition, the university network will be greatly adjusted, and the number of universities in new industrial centers such as Siberia and the Far East will be increased. These and other educational reforms will push Soviet schools to a new stage of development.

    The number of students in Soviet primary and secondary schools will increase from 30 million to 40 million in the next seven years, and the number of boarding students will increase thirteen-fold. The number of experts will also increase significantly: compared with the previous seven years, the number of university graduates will increase by 40%, the number of engineers trained for industry, construction, transportation, and postal communications will increase by 90%, and the number of agricultural experts will increase by 50%. The Soviet Union plans to train 300,000 to 350,000 experts with higher education levels every year in the next seven years, starting next year, of which engineers will account for about one-third.

Rich and Colorful Cultural and Recreational Activities

    In the Soviet Union, the transition to a seven-hour and six-hour work system is underway. With the increase in leisure time, the laboring people's demands for learning and entertainment are also increasing. In order to ensure that the people have rich spiritual food, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that film, publishing, radio broadcasting, and television broadcasting will be widely developed.

    By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, every state farm and collective farm in the countryside will have a movie projector, and the total number of seats in newly built cinemas and theaters in the cities will reach 700,000. In the next seven years, Soviet film studios will provide 972 feature films, more than double the number in the previous seven years. One hundred and forty-eight theaters, seventy-seven music groups, and thirteen acrobatic troupes will also be established. Theater stages will have new automated management equipment.

    Television broadcasting will also be greatly developed, and about 100 new television broadcasting centers and television broadcasting stations will be established. The capitals of all the republics, major industrial centers, and surrounding agricultural areas will have television broadcasts.

    The number of libraries and clubs will also increase greatly. By 1965, the number of books will increase to 1.6 billion, seventeen times more than in 1913. In the next seven years, the Soviet literary and artistic circles will strengthen their ties with the lives of the people and create more and better works that fully reflect the Soviet people's struggle to build a communist society.

    向共产主义迈进的纲领
    苏联的七年计划（（11
    加强共产主义教育  提供丰富精神食粮
    共产主义人材辈出
    强大的物质技术基础和人民的高度觉悟水平，是向共产主义过渡的主要条件。因此，苏联向共产主义迈进的七年计划，规定文教方面的首要任务，是加强对全民的共产主义教育，特别要注意用共产主义精神教育第二代，使学校接近生活，使教育同生产相结合，掌握人类所积累的科学知识，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余。
    世界上第一颗人造卫星、第一个原子能发电站、第一艘原子破冰船、最大的古比雪夫水电站等等科学奇迹，充分证明了苏联在培养人材方面所获得辉煌成就。无论从数量上或质量上讲，苏联在培养专门人材方面都已居于世界首位。目前苏联各高等学校培养的工程师，几乎比美国多两倍。现在，苏联拥有四百多万名大学生，比英、法、西德、意大利四国的大学生总数，还多三倍。
    但是，苏联人民并不满足于已取得的成就。在未来的七年中间，苏联整个国民教育将进行根本的改革。这个改革的目的在于，克服教育与生活的脱节现象，培养青年参加实际生活和有益的劳动，使他们深切尊重社会主义社会的原则。
    大力进行教育改革
    今后七年中，苏联教育改革的重要措施是：把中等教育分为两个阶段，第一个阶段是八年制义务教育，第二个阶段是不同类型的城乡中等劳动学校。苏联高等学校的发展，将走夜校和函授学校的路线，高等学校首先要招收有实际工龄的青年。大部分高等学校的学生在头两三年或后两三年的学习，是不脱产的。此外，将大力调整高等学校网，增加西伯利亚、远东等新工业中心地区的高等学校数量。这些和其他一些教育改革措施，将把苏联的学校推向新的发展阶段。
    苏联中小学校学生在今后七年内将由三千万人增加到四千万人，其中寄宿生将增加十三倍。专家的数量也有很大增长：同前七年相比，高等学校毕业生将增加40％，为工业、建筑、运输、邮电方面培养的工程师将增加90％，农业专家将增加50％。苏联计划七年内，从明年开始，每年将培养出三十万到三十五万名高等教育水平的专家，其中工程师约占三分之一。
    文娱活动丰富多彩
    在苏联，正在向七小时、六小时工作制过渡，随着空闲时间的增多，劳动人民对学习和文娱方面的要求也日益增长。为了保证人民有丰富的精神食粮，七年计划规定，电影、出版、无线电广播和电视广播将获得广泛发展。
    到七年计划末，农村里每个国营农场和集体农庄都将有一台电影放映机，城市里新建影剧院的座位总数将达七十万个。七年内，苏联制片厂将提供九百七十二部艺术片，比前七年增加一倍多。还要建立一百四十八个剧院、七十七个音乐团和十三个杂技院。剧院舞台将拥有新式的自动化管理设备。
    电视广播也要大大发展，将设立一百个左右新的电视广播中心和电视广播站。所有加盟共和国的首都、大工业中心和周围的农业地区都将有电视广播。
    图书馆和俱乐部的数目也将大大增加。到1965年，图书册数将增加到十六亿，即比1913年增加十七倍。苏联文学和艺术界，在未来七年中间，将加强同人民生活的联系，创造出更多、更好的充分反映苏联人民为建成共产主义社会而斗争的作品。（附图片）
