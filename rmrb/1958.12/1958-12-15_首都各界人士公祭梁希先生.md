Xinhua News Agency, December 14th—People from all walks of life in the capital, more than 900 in total, solemnly held a public memorial service at Zhongshan Hall this morning to mourn Mr. Liang Xi, Minister of Forestry of the People's Republic of China, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman of the Science and Technology Association of the People's Republic of China, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society.

    Wreaths sent by Party and state leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai were placed in Mr. Liang Xi's mourning hall. He Long, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Xi Zhongxun, Yang Mingxuan, Li Siguang, Xu Deheng, Ping Jiesan, and Hui Zhongquan served as chief mourners at the public memorial service.

    The public memorial service began at exactly 10:00 a.m. After the band played funeral music, He Long, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, presented a wreath to Mr. Liang Xi's portrait, and everyone stood in silence.

    Xu Deheng then delivered a eulogy. In recalling Mr. Liang Xi's life and deeds, he said that Mr. Liang Xi was a diligent scholar and educator, and a passionate patriot. Xu Deheng said that Mr. Liang Xi had passionately declared that he wanted to see the completion of socialism with his own eyes. Now, Mr. Liang has seen the great leap forward of socialism, which, for Mr. Liang, can be said to be "dying without regret," but from the perspective of the needs of the country and the people, Mr. Liang Xi's death is, after all, a grievous loss.

    Those attending the public memorial service also included heads of various departments of state organs, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital and Mr. Liang Xi's relatives.

    After the public memorial service, the remains were moved to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery for burial.

    Before today, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life had gone to Zhongshan Hall to pay their respects before Mr. Liang Xi's remains. Ambassadors and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China also went to Zhongshan Hall to pay their respects, present wreaths, and participate in the public memorial service.

    首都各界人士公祭梁希先生
    新华社14日讯  首都各界人士九百多人今天上午在中山堂隆重举行公祭，追悼中华人民共和国林业部部长、全国人民代表大会代表、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、中华人民共和国科学技术协会副主席、中国科学院学部委员、九三学社副主席梁希先生。
    梁希先生的灵堂内，陈放着党和国家领导人毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来等人送的花圈。公祭仪式由贺龙、李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、习仲勋、杨明轩、李四光、许德珩、平杰三、惠中权担任主祭。
    十时正公祭仪式开始。乐队奏哀乐后，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理贺龙向梁希先生遗像敬献了花圈，全场肃立默哀。
    许德珩接着致悼词。他在追述梁希先生生平事迹时说，梁希先生是一位勤恳的学者和教育工作者，是一位热情的爱国主义者。许德珩说，梁希先生生前曾热情洋溢地宣布他要亲眼看见社会主义的建成。现在，先生看到了社会主义的大跃进，这在先生说来，可以说是“死而无憾”了，但是从国家和人民的需要来说，梁希先生的去世毕竟是一个沉痛的损失。
