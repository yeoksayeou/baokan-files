In Hubei Province this year, more than 500,000 "cotton girls" have emerged, and the cotton fields they cultivate have mostly achieved high yields. The leader of these cotton girls is Zhou Tingying. After she planted more than two mu of cotton in 1956 and achieved a yield of 413 jin of seed cotton per mu, a "learn from Tingying, catch up with Tingying" cotton girl movement was launched throughout the province. Since then, young rural women and girls in Hubei have enthusiastically engaged in cotton yield experiments. In terms of cotton yield, some cotton girls have already surpassed Zhou Tingying; however, their slogan remains "learn from Tingying, catch up with Tingying." Perhaps they can't forget their leader. A few months ago, I visited Xiangyang, Zaoyang, and other counties. The cotton girls I met there could almost all tell me a story about how Tingying achieved high cotton yields. The walls there still had the large, white-powdered characters "Learn from Tingying, catch up with Tingying."

Zhou Tingying is a girl from the Yushui People's Commune in Sui County, Hubei Province, and is only twenty-one years old this year. However, she was already an outstanding cotton girl two years ago.

In January 1956, the original Shouyi Agricultural Cooperative sent Zhou Tingying to the county town's agricultural technology training class to study. There, Zhou Tingying listened to He Shaohe, a cotton-planting expert from Sui County and a national labor model, introduce his experience of producing 214 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1955. The young girl thought at the time: Others have two hands, and I also have two hands. If he can do it, why can't I? From then on, Zhou Tingying was determined to create high-yield cotton fields. A few weeks later, the training ended. When Zhou Tingying returned home, she went to find two girls in her village who were close to her—Deng Shifang and Fu Guangying—and secretly discussed their plans to conduct high-yield cotton experiments. The two girls immediately agreed to work with her. Subsequently, Zhou Tingying went to the production team leader of her team, told him about their plans, and requested a piece of land for them. The team leader said, "Choose any piece you want!" Tingying thought: If we choose good land, people will say we chose the fatty meat and won't be convinced if we succeed in the future. So, she chose the worst piece of land in the team. That piece of land was more than a li away from her home and had an area of 2.2 mu.

The news that Zhou Tingying and the others were conducting high-yield cotton experiments quickly spread among the commune members. Many people murmured behind their backs: "We've only seen women spinning yarn, never seen women growing cotton. Don't let these young girls ruin the land." Zhou Tingying has a characteristic, which is that she has a steady strength. No matter what others say, she always does what she wants. According to Comrade Lu, a cadre of the county women's federation who worked in Zhou Tingying's team for three or four years: "Don't look at Tingying being only in her twenties, she is not impetuous at all and has the composure of an older sister-in-law."

At the beginning, these three young girls were indeed not very proficient in cotton planting. When sowing, the row spacing was more than two chi wide. Later, Zhou Tingying rushed to He Shaohe, the labor model twenty li away, to visit and came back. She then tried to add a row in the middle of the rows using transplanting methods to achieve 5,000 plants per mu. They also did not recognize cotton pests. Whenever they found insects in the cotton fields, they would catch them, put them in bottles, and take them to the agricultural technician stationed in the commune to ask about them. Each time, they would always ask clearly what kind of insect it was, what its characteristics were, and how to treat it. After diligent study and hard work, Zhou Tingying can now identify various major cotton pests and can formulate various insecticides.

Things are not always as easy as people imagine. When the cotton needed topdressing fertilizer, the team only distributed fertilizer to them according to the amount for ordinary fields. Zhou Tingying requested more, and the commune members said coldly: "These three young girls embroidered that piece of land like embroidery, and they still want more fertilizer. The cotton harvested in the future will not even be enough to cover the costs." Commune member Leng Shuzheng said to their faces: "You are doing some kind of pruning and topping. I think you are using the experiment as an excuse to try to get some work points." Her two partners didn't want to continue after hearing these words. Fu Guangying said to her: "Working on this damned piece of land is both tiring and annoying. Let's not do it anymore." Zhou Tingying quickly said to them: "If we don't do it halfway, won't we be even more ridiculed? As long as we increase production in the future, we won't be afraid of their gossip." Although she used these words to encourage her companions, she herself was a little unable to hold on, so she ran to find Deng Keming, the Party branch secretary and director of the commune, to ask for help. Deng Keming said to her: "You must continue to work hard and don't be discouraged. I will transfer another few dozen jin of chemical fertilizer from the commune to support you." These innocent girls carried the chemical fertilizer back and, for fear that the commune members would gossip, secretly applied it at night. Fu Guangying said with amusement when talking about this matter this time: "We were so timid at that time. Actually, there was nothing to be afraid of. The increased production was not for our own benefit anyway, it was just to increase everyone's income. What was there to be afraid of them saying!"

Through the hard work of these three young girls, this year, 2.2 mu of land yielded a total of 910 jin of seed cotton, which was five times higher than the yield of this land in 1955. Old man Leng Decai, who had been planting cotton on this piece of land for twenty-seven years before cooperativization, said: "I have been planting cotton on this piece of land for more than twenty years, and the highest yield in a year was only more than 300 jin of seed cotton. They harvested more than 900 jin at once. These cotton girls really have the knack."

From then on, the name of cotton girl Zhou Tingying spread throughout the province. Women's federations at all levels studied and discussed her deeds. In 1957 alone, more than 8,000 cotton girls emerged in the Xiangyang area.

In 1957, Zhou Tingying and the others also cultivated one mu of high-yield cotton land in another location. The actual yield of seed cotton was 1,009 jin.

This year, they increased from the original three people to seven people and cultivated ten mu of high-yield experimental land. The highest yield per mu was actually 6,208.5 jin of seed cotton. According to Zhou Tingying's partner Fu Guangying, they put their heart and soul into cultivating this mu of cotton. It was truly nurtured like a baby. In early May, a cold wave came, and nearly 50% of the cotton seedlings were damaged by frost. Zhou Tingying led everyone to find seedlings everywhere to transplant in order to preserve the seedlings. Later, they encountered a drought, and the few of them did not sleep for several nights in a row in order to pump water to fight the drought. One day in mid-June, a sudden rainstorm struck. Fearing that the cotton would be damaged by the strong wind, they built windbreaks along the edge of the cotton field with the help of several male commune members, braving the wind and rain. Several girls fell ill due to building the windbreaks this time, and Zhou Tingying was sick for more than a week.

The people and the Party gave Zhou Tingying, the leader of the cotton girl movement, great honor. Since 1956, Zhou Tingying has been elected as a Hubei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model, a representative to the Hubei Provincial Youth League Congress, and a representative to the National Women's Congress. People from all over the country have also sent her a large number of congratulatory letters. Recently, she also attended the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference. (Attached picture)

    棉花姑娘周廷英
    湖北省今年出现了五十多万个棉花姑娘，她们培育的棉田大都获得高产。这些棉花姑娘的带头人便是周廷英。她在1956年种了两亩多棉花获得亩产籽棉四百一十三斤以后，全省开展了一个“学廷英，赶廷英”的棉花姑娘运动，从此，湖北农村青年姑娘和妇女搞棉花丰产试验的才风起云涌。从棉花产量上说，已有些棉花姑娘超过了周廷英；但是她们的口号仍是“学廷英，赶廷英”。大概是忘不了她们的带头人的缘故吧。几个月前，我曾到襄阳、枣阳等县访问。在那里遇到的一些棉花姑娘，差不多都能给我讲一套廷英怎么搞棉花丰产的故事。那里的墙壁还留有“学廷英，赶廷英”的斗大白粉字。
    周廷英是湖北省随县雨水人民公社的一位姑娘，今年才二十一岁。可是两年前就已经是个出色的棉花姑娘了。
    1956年元月，原首义农业社派周廷英到县城农业技术训练班去学习。在那里，周廷英听了随县植棉能手，全国劳动模范何绍和介绍他1955年亩产皮棉二百一十四斤的经验。这位年轻的姑娘当时心想：别人是一双手，我也有一双手，他做得到，我为什么做不到呢？从此，周廷英就决心要搞棉花丰产田。几个星期后，学习结束了。周廷英回到家里就去找本村跟她要好的两个姑娘——邓世芳、傅光英，悄悄商量搞棉花丰产试验的打算。这两个姑娘立即同意和她一同来搞。随后，周廷英去找本队的生产队长，把她们的打算又告诉了他，并请求给她们一块地。队长说：“随你们挑一块吧！”廷英心想：如果挑好地，将来成功了，大家会说我们是挑的肥肉，不会服气。她就挑了队里最差的一块地。那块地，离她家一里多远，面积有二亩二分。
    周廷英她们搞棉花丰产试验田的消息，很快在社员中传开了。许多人在背后嘀咕道：“只见女人会纺纱，没见女人会种花。别让她们几个黄毛丫头把地糟踏了。”周廷英有个特点，就是有股稳劲，不管别人怎样讲，她总干她的。据曾在周廷英那个队里工作了三、四年的县妇联干部鲁同志告诉我：“你别看廷英只二十多岁，可一点也不浮躁，有老大嫂那种沉着劲。”
    开始的时候，这三个年轻姑娘对于植棉确也不太内行。播种时，行距弄成两尺多宽。后来周廷英赶到二十里外劳动模范何绍和那里参观回来，设法在行子中间用移栽办法加一行，才达到一亩五千株。她们也不认识棉花的害虫。她们在棉田里一发现虫，就捉下来，用瓶子装了拿到驻社的农业技术干部那里去问。每次总要问清楚是什么虫，有什么特征，怎样治。经过勤学苦钻，现在周廷英已能识别棉花各种主要虫害，会调配各种杀虫药剂了。
    事情总不是如人们想像的那样容易。正在棉花需要追肥的时候，队里只按一般田的肥料分给她们。周廷英请求多给一点，社员们冷言冷语地说：“三个毛丫头绣花一样绣了那块地，还要多给肥，将来收的棉花都不够本。”社员冷树正当着面说：“你们又是什么整枝，又是什么打顶心。我看你们是以试验为名，想混些工分。”她的两个伙伴听了这些话，真不想搞下去了。傅光英对她说：“搞了这块鬼地，又累人，又受气，不搞了。”周廷英连忙对她俩说：“如果半路不搞了，不更遭人耻笑吗？只要将来增了产，就不怕他们闲话了。”她虽然用了这些话鼓励她的同伴，但自己也有点沉不住气了，就跑去找党支部书记兼社主任邓克明，请求帮助。邓克明对她说：“你们要继续搞下去，不要灰心。我从社里另外调几十斤化肥支援你们。”这些天真的姑娘把化肥抬回来后，为怕社员们讲怪话，还是趁黑夜里偷偷施的。傅光英这次跟我谈起这件事还好笑地说：“那时真胆小，其实这有什么怕的，丰产了又不是我们自己的，还不是大家增加收入，怕他们讲啥！”
    经过她们三个年轻姑娘的苦干，这一年，二点二亩地共收籽棉九百一十斤，比1955年这块地的产量高五倍。合作化以前在这块地上种了二十七年棉花的冷德彩老汉说：“我在这块地里种了二十多年棉花，最高一年才收三百多斤籽棉，她们一收就是九百多斤，这些棉花姑娘真有门。”
    从此，棉花姑娘周廷英的名字就在全省传开了。各级妇联组织学习、讨论她的事迹。在1957年仅襄阳专区就涌现八千多个棉花姑娘。
    1957年周廷英她们在另外一处，又搞了一亩棉花丰产地。实产籽棉一千零九斤。
    今年她们由原来的三人增加到七人，搞了十亩丰产试验地，其中最高的一亩实产籽棉六千二百零八斤半。据周廷英的伙伴傅光英谈，她们培育这一亩棉花费尽心血。真是像抚育婴儿一样培养出来的。5月初一次寒潮来了，近50％的棉苗冻坏了。周廷英领着大家到处找苗子移栽，才保全了苗。后来又遇天旱，她们几个人为了车水抗旱，曾一连几个夜晚没有睡。6月中旬的一天，暴风雨骤然袭来。她们怕棉花被狂风吹坏，在几个男社员帮助下，冒着风雨在棉田边搭起了防风棚。为这次搭防风棚病倒了好几个姑娘，周廷英病了一个多星期。
    人民和党给这位带头搞棉花姑娘运动的周廷英以很大荣誉。从1956年以来，周廷英曾先后当选为湖北省农业劳动模范，湖北省团代大会代表，全国妇女代表大会代表。全国各地群众还给她寄来大批祝贺信。最近她又出席了全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议。（附图片）
