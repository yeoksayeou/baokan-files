According to a report in the Dazhong Daily, over 140,000 men and women in Wenshang County, Shandong Province, have joined the wheat field management campaign. By December 8th, diluted fertilizer had been applied to 690,000 mu of wheat fields, accounting for 94% of the total wheat field area. An average of over 15,000 jin of liquid manure was applied per mu, and 130,000 mu were rolled and compacted after watering. The second battle of applying diluted fertilizer and covering with organic fertilizer officially began on the afternoon of the 9th, and is expected to be completed soon. To meet the needs of wheat field fertilization, 7.72 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated.

Putting politics in command and launching mass movements are among the prominent experiences in the county's wheat field management work. When the campaign began, some cadres and commune members lacked sufficient understanding of the significant importance of strengthening wheat field management. Seeing that the quality of this year's wheat seeds was high and the growth was good, they believed that high yields could be achieved without management.

In response to the above ideas, the Wenshang County Party Committee launched a mass debate. Through in-depth discussions, commune members clarified the principle that even good wheat seedlings cannot be left unmanaged, because they will deteriorate if neglected, thereby strengthening their determination to do a good job in wheat field management.

At the same time, the County Party Committee convened a wheat field management mobilization meeting of 5,200 cadres above the company and platoon level, as well as red and expert activists. At the meeting, a comparison was made between the high-yield wheat fields cultivated by the former Renmin and Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperatives last year. Other conditions were the same, but the Renmin Cooperative applied fertilizer twice and watered twice before the new year, and applied fertilizer once and watered once after the new year, achieving a yield of 800 jin per mu; while the Xianfeng Cooperative watered once and applied fertilizer once before the new year, and applied fertilizer twice and watered twice after the new year, achieving a yield of 703 jin per mu. This comparison made everyone clearly aware of the importance of strengthening current wheat field management. Through these vivid examples and comparisons, people's minds were further liberated and their enthusiasm boosted. After a mass debate, the Nanzhan Commune formed specialized teams for drilling holes and applying diluted fertilizer, delivering manure, digging manure, and mixing ingredients, led by the First Secretary, and completed the application of diluted manure to all 96,000 mu of wheat in just seven days.

    汶上：给麦田浇稀追肥
    据大众日报消息  山东汶上县十四万多名男女劳动大军投入麦田管理运动。到本月8日，小麦已浇稀追肥六十九万亩，占麦田总面积的94％，平均每亩浇大粪汤一万五千斤以上，还砘压浇水十三万亩。第二次浇稀和封盖有机肥料的战役又从9日下午正式开始，预计最近即可全部结束。为了适应麦田追肥需要，并已积肥七十七亿二千万斤。
    以政治为统帅，大搞群众运动，是这个县麦田管理工作中的突出经验之一。当开始发动时，曾有个别干部和社员对加强麦田管理的重大意义认识不足，他们见到今年小麦种的质量高、生长好，就认为不用管理也能高产了。
    中共汶上县委针对上述思想，发动了一次全民性的大辩论。经过深入讨论，社员明确了麦苗再好也不能放松管理，不管就会变坏的道理，坚定了搞好麦田管理的决心。
    与此同时，县委召开了全县连、排以上干部和红专积极分子五千二百多人的麦田管理誓师大会。会上对比了原来人民和先锋两农业社去年种的小麦丰产田，其他条件都是一样，只是人民社在年前追两肥，浇两水，年后追一肥，浇一水，亩产八百斤；而先锋社年前浇一水，追一肥，年后追两肥，浇两水，亩产七百零三斤。这一对比，使大家清楚地认识到加强当前麦田管理工作的重要。通过这些生动的实例对比，进一步解放了人们的思想，鼓足了干劲。南站公社经过大辩论，全社分别组成打眼浇稀、送粪、挖粪、配料各个专业队，由第一书记带领，突击七天，就把九万六千亩小麦全部浇稀粪一遍。
