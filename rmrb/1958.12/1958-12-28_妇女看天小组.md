    Women's Weather Watching Group
    The former Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative (now a team of the Five-Star People's Commune) in Liancheng Town, Qinglong County, Guizhou, established a weather watching group in August. It consisted of two male members and five female members. Due to the need for steel production, the two male members were transferred to factories, leaving only the current five female members, including Liu Dafen, in the weather watching group. The villagers simply call them the Women's Weather Watching Group.
    This Women's Weather Watching Group has accumulated rich weather watching experience in just a few months. For example, high skies (i.e., very high cloud layers) indicate sunny weather, while low skies indicate rain; white fog indicates sunshine, while black fog running all over the mountains indicates rain; a wind direction turning north or blowing randomly everywhere, damp stones after a long period of sunshine, smoke not leaving the door, pigs not running around in their pens, etc., are all signs of cloudy and rainy days; a south wind, cool evenings, heavy dew, chickens flapping their wings, pigs running around, ants moving their nests, etc., are all signs of sunny weather; old people feeling aches and pains predict changing weather; a scorching sun, people feeling tired even without working, yellowish skies, thunder sounding different from the usual rainy-day thunder, rumbling like a瓮声 [wèng shēng, muffled sound], are all signs that hail may fall.
    They use these folk experiences to make daily weather forecasts, as well as medium-term forecasts for three to five days, with a high degree of accuracy. This has brought many benefits to the team's production. For example, from October 13th to 16th, they predicted cloudy weather with light rain. During these four days, in addition to planting more than ten mu of vegetables, the team arranged labor to sort out the already harvested 2,000 jin of cured tobacco and collect more than 800 jin of raw tobacco from the fields to prevent the cured tobacco from molding. From November 1st to 12th, within a twelve-day period, they made three consecutive medium-term forecasts of sunny weather. The whole team rushed to harvest 130,000 jin of corn, 1,800 jin of rice, and 6,200 jin of beans. The team members all reflected on these benefits, saying, "Meteorological work is really good! With forecasts, we won't suffer losses!"
    The weather watching group has to record weather forecasts every day, but among the five members, only Liu Dafen attended elementary school for two years twenty years ago. The others are illiterate, and even Liu Dafen herself cannot write it down. In order to maintain regular records, they came up with a way - using symbols to replace words. For example, a circle with a dot in the middle “⊙” represents sunny weather, a horizontal line “—” represents cloudy weather; a horizontal line with a dot above “?” represents light rain in the morning; a horizontal line with a dot below “?” represents light rain in the afternoon; a “×” represents moderate or heavy rain; a “×” with a dot above “?” represents heavy rain in the morning; a “×” with a dot below “?” represents heavy rain in the afternoon. Representatives from the provincial meteorological work on-site meeting visited and praised their creation.
    The success of this weather watching group has not been smooth sailing. Initially, after the two male members were transferred, the female members felt relieved. They were afraid of rainy days because the mountain roads were slippery and difficult to walk, making it inconvenient to hang lanterns. At the same time, they believed that meteorological work was science and dared not engage in it, especially for women who had never done these things before and feared making mistakes. They were unwilling to continue.
    At this time, the team leader asked them to break superstitions, dare to think and dare to act, saying that women can also shoulder the things that men do. It was also at this time that the county party committee and town party committee issued instructions requiring the consolidation and improvement of the existing weather watching groups. Thus, under the instructions and encouragement of the Party, they held three consecutive meetings, unified their thinking, and reorganized the weather watching group. The group leader, Liu Dafen, said, "Plowing the fields is very difficult, but we learned it. Can't we learn meteorology? As long as we listen to the Party, we can do anything well." One evening, the weather broadcast said that there would be light rain the next day, but they saw that the wind was favorable and the rain would not fall. So, they boldly made a correction and made a sunny forecast, and the next day was indeed sunny. In this way, their courage was boosted, and they boldly made weather forecasts.

### 妇女看天小组

    妇女看天小组
    贵州晴隆县连城镇原五一农业社（现在是五星人民公社的一个连），在8月份建立了一个看天小组。其中男社员二人，女社员五人。由于钢铁生产的需要，两个男社员都被调到工厂去了，这个看天小组就只剩下现在的刘达芬等五个女社员，社员们就干脆称她们叫妇女看天小组。
    这个妇女看天小组成立才几个月，已经积累了丰富的看天经验。如天高（即云层很高）就会天晴，天矮就要下雨；雾带白色就要晴，雾带黑色满山跑就要下雨；风向转北或到处乱刮，久晴以后石头发潮，火烟不出门，猪在圈内不乱跑，等等，都是阴天和下雨天的象征；吹南风，晚上很凉爽，露水大，鸡扇翅膀，猪到处乱跑，蚂蚁搬家，等等，都是晴天的象征；老人的身上发痛预兆天气要变化；太阳火辣，人不做活路也会疲倦得难受，天色发黄，雷声与一般雨天的雷声不一样，吼起来是瓮声的，这些现象就可能要下冰雹。
    她们利用这些土经验来作一天的天气预报，还用来作三天到五天的中期预报，准确率很高。这给社里的生产带来了很多的好处。如10月13日到16日，她们预报阴天有小雨，在这四天中，除种了十多亩蔬菜外，为了防止烤烟发霉，社里即安排劳力，整理好已收回来的二千斤烤烟，并从地里收回八百多斤生烟。从11月1日到12日的十二天时间内，她们连续作了三次晴天的中期预报，全社共抢收包谷十三万斤，水稻一千八百斤，豆类六千二百斤。社员们对这些好处都纷纷反映：“气象工作硬是好，有了预报就不会受损失了！”
    看天小组每天要记录天气预报，但是这五个组员中，除了刘达芬在二十年前读过两年小学以外，其他的都不识字，就是刘达芬自己也写不下来。为了保持经常的记录，她们想出了一个办法——用符号来代替文字。如：划个圈打一点即“⊙”表示晴天，划一横即“—”表示阴天；一横上面打一点即“?”表示上午有小雨；一横下面打一点即“?”表示下午有小雨；划个“×”表示有中雨或大雨；“×”的上面打一点即“?”表示上午有大雨；“×”的下面打一点即“?”表示下午有大雨。全省气象工作现场会议的代表到这里参观，都称赞她们的这种创造。
    这个看天小组能够办得比较好，也并不是一帆风顺的。起初，两个男社员被调走以后，女社员们都松气下来了。她们怕下雨天，山路又滑又难走，去挂灯时很不方便。同时认为气象工作是科学，不敢搞，特别是妇女，过去根本没有做过这些事，怕搞错。都不愿意再搞下去。
    这时，社主任要她们破除迷信，敢想敢作，说妇女一样能够负担男子做的事情。也正是在这个时候，县委和镇委都发出了指示，要求巩固提高现有的看天小组。这样，在党的指示和鼓舞下，她们连续召开了三次会议，统一了思想认识，又把看天小组重新组织起来。组长刘达芬说：“犁田很难，都学会了，难道气象就学不会吗？只要听党的话，那样都能作好。”有一天晚上，气象广播说第二天有小雨，但她们看风是顺的，雨下不来，于是她们大胆地作了订正，作了晴天的预报，第二天果然是晴天。这样，她们的勇气鼓起来了，大胆地作天气预报了。
