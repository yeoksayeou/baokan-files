Folk Songs

    Commune Members Rule the World
  In April, pear blossoms are all white,
  Our commune has established a weather station.
  Fog, dew, snow, and frost listen to commands,
  Wind, clouds, thunder, and rain are at our disposal.
  In the past, we begged Heaven,
  Now Heaven bows to us.
  Commune members rule the world,
  Let's see if you, Heaven, will still act up.
          (Henan)

    More Foresighted Than Kong Ming
  Laugh at Shunfeng'er for his failing ears,
  Laugh at Qianliyan for his poor eyesight;
  Wind, clouds, thunder, and snow are controlled by people,
  More foresighted than Kong Ming.
  The weather balloon descends with a creak,
  Pairs of fishing boats are about to set sail;
  Laughter follows the ships out to sea,
  Returning to the village laden with fish and shrimp.
          (Shantou)

    公社社员坐天下
  四月梨花一片白，
  俺社成立气象台。
  雾露雪霜听命令，
  风云雷雨任指派。
  过去咱把老天求，
  现在老天把咱拜。
  公社社员坐天下，
  看你老天再作怪。
          （河南）
    未卜先知胜孔明
  笑顺风耳耳不灵，
  笑千里眼眼不精；
  风云雷雪人掌管，
  未卜先知胜孔明。
  风球降落咿呀声，
  对对鱼船要开行；
  笑声随航出海去，
  满载鱼虾返回村。
          （汕头）
