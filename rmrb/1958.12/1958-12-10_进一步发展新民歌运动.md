    Further Develop the New Folk Song Movement
    Lu Xuebin
    When we talk about folk songs, we must first note the following fact: in the mass literary and artistic creation movement since the Great Leap Forward, the creation of folk songs has been the most outstanding. According to incomplete statistics from forty-one counties and five cities in Anhui, more than 310 million folk songs have emerged in just a few months. Many of these works have reached a very high level both in terms of ideological and artistic merit, writing a brilliant page in the history of poetry. This massive New Folk Song Movement is an important symbol of the great popularization of literature and art in our country.
    Folk songs of every era are a reflection of the face of that era, faithfully reflecting the reality of the time. Since the beginning of the socialist Great Leap Forward, a high tide of cultural revolution has emerged, accompanied by the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. On the fronts of production and cultural construction, there are huge and profound changes happening all the time. These changes encourage the masses' will to continue to advance, and arouse their desire to pursue a better life. They cannot help but express all this and sing it out. This is the fundamental reason for the vigorous development of the New Folk Song Movement. The importance, advocacy, and support of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for folk songs has given the broad masses of people tremendous encouragement. These new folk songs inherit the traditions of past folk songs, maintaining and developing the beautiful features of past folk songs, but they are fundamentally different in content from past folk songs. The reason is that society has changed, the times have changed, and the position of the working people has also changed. In the past, the working people were objects of oppression, exploitation, humiliation, and harm. The voice in their hearts only contained curses, accusations, and resistance against the old society. Since liberation, people have lived in a completely new society and a completely new era. The working people are the masters of society. Under the leadership of the Party, they are constantly creating miracles, realizing their ideals, and creating an infinitely beautiful future for generations to come. Therefore, their songs are full of joy, pride, confidence, and strength. They sing about the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, about their own labor, about the achievements of socialist construction, and about the great ideals of communism. In tens of thousands of folk songs, the working people have sung their hearts, and in turn, these folk songs have become the force driving them forward. As one folk song describes: "Now singing is loaded by the basket, thousands of baskets filled to the brim, don't think they are just words of mouth, scattered in the fields they turn into rice." "Scattered in the fields they turn into rice," this is certainly a literary exaggeration, but the inspiring effect of the new folk songs on production is not to be ignored.
    The new folk songs are not only healthy in ideological content, but also have achievements in artistic style and expression techniques. They maintain the characteristics of folk songs, inherit the tradition of classical Chinese poetry, and at the same time absorb the strengths of new poetry, opening up a brand new path for the development of Chinese poetry. Now, let us give a few examples of new folk songs from Anhui:
    Tear off a piece of white cloud to wipe sweat
    The rice stacks are piled round, the commune members pile the rice to the sky,
    Tear off a piece of white cloud to wipe sweat, lighting a cigarette with the sun.
    Manage the sky, manage the earth, manage the immortals
    Who says it's hard for mortals to reach the sky, our strength is boundless,
    Now the heavens and the earth belong to the commune, managing the sky, managing the earth, managing the immortals.
    Anti-drought mountain song
    A mountain song gives a surge of strength, singing the spring water out to listen,
    Hold the spring water, don't let it go, listen to me sing of the harvest in the autumn.
    Missing Mother
    Haven't seen Mother for a long time, I miss her, seeing Mother at home is also ordinary,
    Awake in the middle of the night, my heart is anxious, tomorrow the commune wants to dig the pond.
    Singing Chairman Mao
    Chairman Mao points to the mountain, trees grow tall, Chairman Mao points to the river, the river water is clear,
    Chairman Mao draws a line on the map, highways and railways appear together.
    Although the folk songs quoted above are not necessarily representative works of new folk songs in Anhui, from these few folk songs, we can also see the characteristics of the new folk songs in artistic expression techniques: First, in many excellent new folk songs, the imagination is very rich, with a strong color of revolutionary romanticism: "Tear off a piece of white cloud to wipe sweat, lighting a cigarette with the sun." "Now the land all belongs to the commune, managing the sky, managing the earth, managing the immortals." What a bold fantasy, and what a heroic spirit! In the "Anti-drought Mountain Song," the author joyfully sings about his labor, imagining that the spring water comes out to listen to his happy songs, and even wants to hold on to the kindred spirit of the spring water, and listen to him sing even more beautiful songs in the autumn. The author's thoughts and feelings are as lively and free as the fish swimming in the clear river water. This bold fantasy is by no means a bluff or wishful thinking, but is based on reality and closely integrated with revolutionary practice. This is precisely the characteristic of the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. Second, the authors of many excellent folk songs are good at grasping the characteristics of objective things and people's psychological activities, using extremely concise language to express their thoughts and feelings concretely and vividly. Like the "Missing Mother" folk song quoted above, it vividly writes about the psychological activities of a female commune member who returns home to visit her relatives, reflecting the growth of collectivist thinking among the peasants. Third, the new folk songs, on the one hand, inherit and develop the strengths of classical poetry, absorb the characteristics of metrical poetry, with clear syllables and rhymes, easy to read aloud and easy to memorize; on the other hand, they use the living language of the masses, avoiding the more profound and difficult-to-understand shortcomings of classical poetry. This characteristic is also one of the places where new folk songs are better than new poetry. Whether poetry must have rhyme is a question that can naturally be further discussed. Under the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom, free verse should not be rejected, but it is obvious that rhyming poetry is easier to spread widely among the masses.
    What has been said above cannot include all the characteristics of the new folk songs in artistic techniques. We need to study this further in depth, but in any case, we must give a high evaluation to the artistic achievements of the new folk songs. The fresh and dazzling brilliance of these new folk songs makes people feel energetic and happy. Many excellent new folk songs are truly the newest and most beautiful poems.
    In the high tide of mass literary and artistic creation, the new folk songs took the lead, playing a huge impact on other literary and artistic creations and promoting their development. Of course, we must also see that in the process of the great popularization of literature and art, there will inevitably be a considerable number of works that are relatively rough and relatively immature. Therefore, we must improve on the basis of great popularization, and continue to popularize under the guidance of improvement. On the issue of popularization and improvement, we must criticize two incorrect viewpoints: Some literary and artistic workers still despise popularization, look down on folk songs, and look down on mass creation. They believe that new folk songs are mostly five- or seven-character four-line poems, which cannot express complex emotions and cannot reflect major themes; they emphasize that the form of folk songs has limitations, saying that it may not be possible to use it to unify the form of new poetry, and it may not become the dominant form. This view not only does not conform to objective facts, but more importantly, it exposes their thinking of despising mass creation. On the other hand, some comrades have gone to another extreme. They are satisfied with the existing folk songs, believing that popularization itself is improvement, and neglecting and relaxing the work of improvement. This view is also one-sided and incorrect. Our Party has pointed out that Chinese poetry should be improved and developed on the basis of new folk songs and classical poetry, not to stay on this basis. In fact, the broad masses of people are no longer satisfied with the existing popularization. Solving this problem correctly and in a timely manner is of great significance for promoting the New Folk Song Movement to develop more vigorously.
    According to the experience of some areas in Anhui, the further improvement of new folk songs roughly has two aspects: one is the improvement of folk songs themselves, and the other is the combination of folk songs with other forms of literature and art. These two aspects are very closely related. Other forms of literature and art can certainly absorb rich nutrients from folk songs and learn and develop their beautiful styles. Conversely, once other forms of literature and art are combined with folk songs, they can promote its further development. We must pay equal attention to these two aspects of work.
    From the perspective of the new folk songs themselves, as pointed out earlier: their ideological content is generally healthy; in terms of expression techniques, many works are vigorous, fresh, lively, and have the characteristics of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. However, due to the limitations of the cultural level and literary accomplishment of the broad masses of working people, many works still have shortcomings in terms of artistry, such as the selection of language, the use of rhyme, tone, and rhythm, etc., all of which need to be further improved. In terms of the form of new folk songs, there are currently more lyrical poems and propaganda poems, and fewer narrative poems, story poems, satirical poems, etc., and the diversification of forms is still insufficient. We must further carry forward the excellent traditions of folk songs and classical poetry of all dynasties in our country, absorb the strengths of new poetry, and promptly summarize and promote the creations of new folk songs in content and form, so that the content of our new folk songs is richer, the form is more diverse, and the higher artistic level is achieved. In our new folk songs, there should not only be excellent short poems, but also excellent long poems, not only a large number of lyrical poems and propaganda poems, but also a large number of narrative poems and story poems, and fully utilize various forms and styles to open up a broader path for the development of new folk songs. In order to do this, we believe that:
    First of all, we must do a good job in the collection, selection, and promotion of folk songs. In this regard, our literary and artistic workers have already made great achievements in the past few months, and must be further strengthened in the future. The significance of this work is to promptly select the most outstanding works from the vast sea of folk songs and establish them as models for the masses to learn from. This can help the masses break through the existing level and develop more rapidly.
    Secondly, we must do a good job in the sorting and processing of folk songs. In the process of sorting, for those folk songs that are already very good, we should not rashly modify them; however, for those works that are ideologically healthy, have good themes, but are relatively rough in expression techniques, we should carry out appropriate processing without harming the original thoughts, feelings, and language style. Of course, whether the modification is good or not must be tested among the masses, but we must make great efforts to do this work. In fact, many excellent folk songs have been continuously modified in the process of dissemination, and finally formed relatively perfect works. Today, in addition to vigorously advocating that the masses modify themselves, we also organize some professional literary and artistic workers to combine with the masses to carry out the sorting and processing of folk songs. This is of great benefit both to the improvement of new folk songs and to the improvement of professional literary and artistic workers themselves.
    In addition, it is necessary to further carry forward the excellent traditions of classical Chinese poetry, so that new folk songs can be further improved, and on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry, create brand new poetry. Like folk songs, Chinese classical poetry also has a long history, and many excellent works have a very high position in the world's poetry scene. In classical poetry, for example, the works of Qu Yuan, Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, etc., and in modern old-style poetry, such as the works of Chairman Mao, are immortal masterpieces in Chinese and foreign poetry, radiating brilliant brilliance in the field of literature and art. The works of the several excellent ancient poets mentioned here all have the colors of realism and romanticism, which is precisely what we want to inherit and develop. In addition, the forms of classical poetry all express the characteristics of the Chinese language, as long as we do not adhere to the limitations of tones and rhymes, and are not bound by the rules of prosody. The strengths of these poetic forms should also be absorbed.
    In order to complete this major task well, it is also necessary to combine literary and artistic workers with the broad masses. Literary and artistic workers must go deep into the masses, on the one hand, to transform their own thoughts and enrich their creation in the fiery struggle of the masses; on the other hand, use their own literary and artistic cultivation to carry out the collection, selection, sorting, processing, and promotion of new folk songs, help the masses improve the level of literary and artistic creation, learn the tradition of classical poetry, absorb the strengths of new poetry, and promote the New Folk Song Movement to develop further. Since the rectification movement, many literary and artistic workers have gone to the countryside and factories to help the masses carry out literary and artistic activities. This practice should be continued.
    Regarding the combination of folk songs and other forms of literature and art, it is only a preliminary attempt. From the existing experience, there are mainly the following ways to achieve this combination:
    The first is the combination of folk songs and painting. A few days ago, Wangren Township in Fuyang County launched a large-scale creation movement of folk songs and murals, and their slogan was: "There are poems on the walls, there are paintings in the poems, there are poems in the paintings, there are paintings in the poems, poetry and painting are combined, blooming everywhere." In just over ten days, more than 1,100 people participated in the creation, painting more than 16,000 murals. Many of these works have the characteristics of the excellent folk art tradition of our country and are full of the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.
    The combination of poetry and painting can not only supplement the folk songs with concrete images and increase their artistic charm, but also make the painting shine with the description of language. This experience of Wangren Township is worthy of great attention. In fact, not only murals can be combined with folk songs, but also posters and comic strips can be combined with folk songs. All of these require us to create in practice. The combination of poetry and painting was originally an excellent tradition in Chinese painting. Historically, many poets were painters, and painters were poets; there were also many poets and painters who cooperated with each other, one painting and one inscription of poetry, so that poetry and painting complemented each other and increased the artistic effect. However, the past poems were neither folk songs nor the paintings were folk paintings, and they could not be widely circulated among the masses. Now the working people have not only pioneered a generation of poetry with new folk songs, but also inherited the tradition of combining poetry and painting and further developed it. This fully demonstrates the working people's desire to master art and their spirit of bold creation.
    The second is the combination of folk songs and music. Folk songs are called folk songs because they can be sung. Until today, many folk songs are still sung orally in various folk tunes, maintaining this traditional characteristic. For example, the creation of Yin Guanglan, a famous folk singer in Feidong County, is a folk song that can be read and sung. Recently, many musicians have composed music for excellent folk songs. This practice not only makes the folk songs more colorful and can be spread more widely, but also allows musicians to find the content they want to express from folk songs and absorb fresh blood from the literary and artistic creation of the masses. The Anhui Provincial Opera Troupe absorbed the essence of beautiful folk tunes, made music scores for some excellent folk songs, and organized a "Great Leap Forward Mountain Song Series," which was warmly welcomed by the masses. Facts have proved that the combination of folk songs and music is completely correct. If the music score is the wing of the lyrics, then the lyrics are the soul of the music. With excellent folk songs and excellent music scores, the combination of the two can achieve a greater effect. In the future, on the one hand, we must advocate that the masses write and sing their own songs, and use folk tunes more widely to sing folk songs; on the other hand, we must also advocate that musicians make a large number of music scores for folk songs, combine the mass folk song creation movement with the mass singing movement, so that folk songs and music promote each other, improve each other, and develop forward side by side.
    The third is the combination of folk songs and dance. Singing and dancing are the languages ​​commonly used by the Chinese people to describe happy scenes, and there is a very close relationship between singing and dancing. For example, the traditional dance programs "Flower Drum Lantern," "Quail Nesting," and many programs in local operas in our province all have songs and dances. In the first Music Week in Anhui Province, the Provincial Art College used classical and folk dance performance techniques when performing the "Thousands of Miles of Northern Anhui Changing to Southern Jiangsu" folk song series and other programs, which achieved good results. We should maintain and develop the tradition of singing and dancing, so that folk songs can not only be sung, but also combined with dance, opening up a newer situation in the art of song and dance. Some dance workers, because they have been influenced by foreign dogmas, think that songs are songs and dances are dances, and even advocate forcibly turning some traditional song and dance programs into pure dances, which is wrong and should be criticized.
    The fourth is the combination of folk songs and drama. This combination is mainly reflected in two aspects: one is that it can absorb the theme ideology from folk songs; the other is that excellent folk songs can be used to enrich the lyrics of dramas. During the drought resistance this year, Chaoxian County had these two folk songs: "Displaying heroism under the red flag, picking up Chaohu Lake as a water scoop, not afraid of the sky not raining, wherever there is drought, there is irrigation." "Thousands of dragons connect to the sky, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl smile, now the Milky Way water is drained, before the Double Seventh Festival, they will be reunited."
    Theatrical workers, based on the thoughts of these two folk songs and the folk song "Managing the Sky, Managing the Earth, Managing the Immortals," and supplemented and enriched them, compiled the Lu Opera script "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Smile." In this script, many excellent folk songs are used as lyrics. Some folk songs are unchanged, and some are appropriately and necessarily rewritten on the original basis. The lyrics created by the author himself also try to learn the beautiful style of folk songs. This drama has songs and dances, and also absorbs some mountain songs and Yangko in the music, blending into the original singing style, making the original singing style richer. Although this is a preliminary attempt, judging from the performance effect, it can be said to be successful. The creation from the folk song "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Smile" to the Lu Opera "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Smile" is roughly similar to the creation from "The Song of Everlasting Regret" to "The Palace of Eternal Life." This is a good example of the combination of folk songs and drama. Since Lu Opera can do this, other operas can also do this. In the future, with the large-scale emergence of narrative poems and story-style folk songs, it will inevitably become an important source for drama to draw materials from. As long as we continue to work hard, we can make the drama absorb rich nutrition from folk songs, make the content of the drama more rich in the spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and more rich in national and folk characteristics. This is of great significance to the development of drama.
    The fifth is the combination of folk songs and folk art. Folk art is a literary and artistic form that is widely loved by the masses, and its scope of activities is very broad. Drum lyrics, Zhui Zi, Yangqin, Kuaishu, etc. in folk art also mostly use rhyming mass language, which is very close to longer narrative folk songs. Therefore, the combination of folk songs and folk art is quite easy and very natural. The Henan Zhui Zi "Driving the Dragon King" published in the "Anhui Daily" supplement and the anti-drought drum lyrics "Frightening the Jade Emperor" published in "Jianghuai Literature" are such examples. Both of these works have absorbed the characteristics of folk songs, and can be read as folk songs or sung as folk art scripts. This not only makes folk art richer and more vivid, but also makes folk songs more diverse and lively.
    Of the above-mentioned combinations, some have already made good achievements, and some have just begun. In future practice, many new problems will inevitably arise, requiring us to study and solve them in a timely manner, but the direction of this combination seems to be completely certain. It should be pointed out here that folk songs are the things of the masses. When combining them with other forms of literature and art, we should also pay attention to the characteristic of mass nature and the characteristics of the other forms of literature and art themselves. If this is ignored, unnecessary detours will inevitably be taken in the work.
    The above are some of my superficial views on the New Folk Song Movement in Anhui. Whether they are correct or not is only for everyone's discussion. The future of the New Folk Song Movement is very bright. It has opened up a new path for the development of poetry in our country and will emit more brilliant brilliance in the future.

    进一步发展新民歌运动
    陆学斌
    说到民歌，我们必须首先注意到以下一个事实：在大跃进以来的群众性文艺创作运动里，民歌的创作是最为出色的。据我们安徽四十一个县和五个市的不完全统计，在短短的几个月里，就出现了三亿一千多万首民歌，其中不少作品，不论在思想性和艺术性上都达到了很高的水平，在诗歌的历史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。这个声势浩大的新民歌运动，是我国文学艺术大普及的一个重要标志。
    每个时代的民歌，都是每一时代面貌的写照，它忠实地反映了当时的现实。社会主义大跃进开始以来，伴随着工农业生产的飞速发展，出现了文化革命的高潮。在生产建设和文化建设的战线上，无时无刻不在发生着巨大而深刻的变化。这种变化鼓舞着群众继续前进的意志，唤起了他们追求更加美好生活的愿望，他们情不自禁地要把这一切表达出来，歌唱出来。这就是新民歌运动蓬勃发展的根本原因。而党中央和毛主席对于民歌的重视、提倡和支持，更给予广大群众以莫大的鼓舞。这些新的民歌，继承了过去民歌的传统，保持和发扬了过去民歌中优美的特色，但是在内容上和过去的民歌却有了根本的不同。其原因是社会变了，时代变了，劳动人民的地位也变了。过去劳动人民是受压迫、受剥削、受侮辱、被损害的对象，他们心里的声音，只有对旧社会的诅咒、控诉和反抗；而解放以来，人们生活在全新的社会和全新的时代里，劳动人民是社会的主人，他们在党的领导下不断地创造着奇迹，实现着自己的理想，并且为子孙万代缔造无限美好的将来。因此，在他们的歌声里充满了愉快、自豪、信心和力量。他们歌唱着党和毛主席的领导，歌唱着自己的劳动，歌唱着社会主义建设的成就，歌唱着共产主义的远大理想。在成千上万首的民歌里，劳动人民唱出了自己的心声，反过来，这些民歌又成了推动他们前进的力量。正如一首民歌中所描写的：“如今唱歌用箩装，千箩万箩堆满仓，别看都是口头语，撒到田里变米粮。”“撒到田里变米粮”，这诚然是文学上的夸张，但是，新民歌对于生产的鼓舞作用，是丝毫不容忽视的。
    新民歌不仅在思想内容上是健康的，而且在艺术风格和表现手法上也有其成就。它保持了民歌的特色，继承了我国古典诗歌的传统，同时又吸取了新诗的长处，为我国诗歌的发展开辟了一条崭新的道路。下面，让我们举出几首安徽的新民歌吧：
    撕片白云揩揩汗
    稻堆脚儿摆得圆，社员堆稻上了天，
    撕片白云揩揩汗，凑着太阳吸袋烟。
    管天管地管神仙
    谁说凡人难上天，咱们力量大无边，
    如今天地都归社，管天管地管神仙。
    抗旱山歌
    一声山歌一股劲，唱得泉水出来听，
    拉住泉水别让走，听我秋后唱丰收。
    想娘
    久不见娘心想娘，回家见娘也平常，
    睡到半夜心发急，明天社里要挑塘。
    歌唱毛主席
    毛主席指山山长树，毛主席指河河水清，
    毛主席在地图上画条线，公路铁路齐出现。
    尽管上面所引的几首民歌并不一定是安徽新民歌中的代表作品，但是从这几首民歌里，也可以看出新民歌在艺术表现手法上的特色：第一，在许多优秀的新民歌中，想像力都是非常丰富的，具有浓厚的革命浪漫主义的色彩：“撕片白云揩揩汗，凑着太阳吸袋烟。”“如今土地都归社，管天管地管神仙。”这是多么大胆的幻想，又是多么豪迈的气魄！在“抗旱山歌”里，作者愉快地歌唱着自己的劳动，设想泉水是出来倾听他的快活的歌声，甚至于想拉住知音泉水，听他在秋后唱出更动听的歌声。作者的思想感情，简直像清滢的河水中的游鱼一样地活泼自由。这种大胆的幻想，绝不是虚张声势或者想入非非，而是以现实做基础，和革命的实践紧密地结合在一起的。这正是革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的特色。第二，许多优秀民歌的作者，都善于抓住客观事物和人们心理活动的特点，运用极其简练的语言，具体而形象地表达自己的思想感情。像前面所举出的“想娘”这一首民歌，很逼真地写出了一个回家省亲的女社员的心理活动，反映了农民中集体主义思想的成长。第三，新民歌一方面继承了和发扬了古典诗歌的长处，吸取了格律诗的特点，音节、韵脚比较鲜明，容易朗读，便于背诵；另一方面又是运用群众中的活的语言，避免了古典诗词上比较深奥、难懂的缺点，这个特点，也是新民歌胜过新诗的地方之一。诗是不是必须有韵，这个问题自然还可以进一步讨论，在百花齐放的原则之下，对于自由诗也不应加以排斥，但有韵的诗歌便于在群众中广泛流传，却是显而易见的。
    以上所说，并不能包括新民歌在艺术手法上的全部特点，在这方面还需要我们进一步深刻地研究，但无论如何，对于新民歌在艺术上的成就，也不能不给予高的评价。这些新民歌的新鲜夺目的光彩，使人们感到精神奋发，心情舒畅。许许多多优秀的新民歌，是名副其实的最新最美的诗篇。
    在群众性的文艺创作高潮里，新民歌一马当先，对其他文艺创作起了巨大的冲击作用，推动了它们的发展。当然，我们也必须看到，在文学艺术大普及的过程里，不可避免地会有相当一部分作品比较粗糙，比较幼稚，因此必须在大普及的基础上加以提高，在提高的指导下继续普及。在普及与提高的问题上，必须批判两种不正确的观点：有些文艺工作者，现在仍然轻视普及，看不起民歌，看不起群众创作。他们认为新民歌多半是五、七言四句，不能表达复杂的感情，不能反映重大的题材；强调民歌体裁有限制，说是未必可以用它来统一新诗的形式，也不一定会成为支配的形式。这种看法不仅不符合客观事实，更重要的是暴露了他们轻视群众创作的思想。另一方面，有的同志又跑到另外一个极端，他们满足于现有的民歌，认为普及本身就是提高，忽视了和放松了提高工作，这种看法也是片面的，不正确的。我们党曾经指出，我国的诗歌，要在新民歌和古典诗歌的基础上提高和发展，并不是要停留在这个基础上。事实上，广大群众对于现有的普及已经不能满足了，及时地正确地解决这个问题，对于推动新民歌运动更蓬勃地向前发展，是有着极为重要的意义的。
    根据我们安徽某些地区的经验，新民歌的进一步提高，大体上有两个方面：一个是民歌本身的提高，一个是民歌与其他文艺形式相结合。这两个方面有着非常密切的关系。其他文艺形式固然可以从民歌中吸取丰富的养料，学习和发扬它的优美的风格，反过来，其他文艺形式一经和民歌相结合，又可以推动它进一步地发展。对于这两方面的工作，必须同样地予以重视。
    从新民歌本身来看，正如前面所指出的：它的思想内容一般都是健康的；在表现手法上，不少作品都是刚健清新，生动活泼，具有革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的特点。但是，广大劳动群众由于文化水平和文学修养的限制，许多作品在艺术性上还存在着不足的地方，例如语言的选择，韵律、音律、节奏的运用等等，都需要进一步提高。在新民歌的体裁上，目前是抒情诗和宣传诗比较多，叙事诗、故事诗、讽刺诗等等还比较少，形式上的多样化还嫌不足。我们必须进一步发扬我国历代民歌和古典诗歌的优良传统，吸取新诗的长处，及时总结和推广新民歌在内容上和形式上的创造，使我们新民歌内容更加丰富，形式更加多样，达到更高的艺术水平。在我们的新民歌里，不仅要有优秀的短诗，并且要有优秀的长诗，不仅要有大量的抒情诗和宣传诗，而且要有大量的叙事诗和故事诗，把各种体裁、各种形式都充分地运用起来，为新民歌的发展开辟更广阔的道路。为了做到这一点，我们认为：
    首先必须做好民歌的收集、选择和推广工作。在这方面，过去几个月中，我们的文艺工作者已经做出了很大的成绩，今后还必须进一步加强。这一工作的意义，就是把浩如烟海的大量民歌中的尖端作品，及时地选择出来，为群众树立起学习的榜样。这样便可以帮助群众突破现有的水平，更加迅速地向前发展。
    其次必须做好民歌的整理和加工工作。在整理的过程中，对于那些本来就很好的民歌，我们不要轻率地加以改动；但是，对于那些思想健康、主题很好但表现手法上比较粗糙的作品，就应该在不损害原来的思想、感情和语言风格的原则下，进行适当的加工。当然，改得好不好，还要拿到群众中去加以考验，但对于这一工作，必须以极大的努力来做。事实上，许多优秀的民歌，都是在传唱的过程中，经过不断地修改，才最终形成了比较完美的作品。今天，我们除了大力提倡群众自己修改以外，还组织一些专业文艺工作者与群众结合，来进行民歌的整理和加工工作。这不论对新民歌的提高来说，或者对于专业文艺工作者本身的提高来说，都有很大的好处。
    此外，必须进一步发扬我国古典诗歌中的优良传统，使新民歌进一步提高，并且在民歌和古典诗歌的基础上，创造出崭新的诗歌来。和民歌一样，我国的古典诗歌也是有着悠久的历史的，其中有许多优秀的作品，在世界的诗坛上有着极高的地位。在古典诗歌中，例如屈原、李白、杜甫、白居易等人的作品，在现代旧体诗词中，如毛主席的作品，都是中外诗歌中不朽的杰作，在文艺领域里放射着灿烂的光辉。像这里所举出的几个古代优秀诗人，他们的作品都具有现实主义和浪漫主义的色彩，这个特点，正是我们要继承和发扬的地方。另外，古典诗歌的形式，也都表现了中国语言的特点，只要我们不拘泥于平仄的限制，不削足适履地为格律所束缚。这些诗歌形式上的长处，也是应该吸取的。
    为了很好地完成这个重大的任务，还必须做到文艺工作者与广大群众相结合。文艺工作者必须深入到群众中去，一方面在群众的火热的斗争中来改造自己的思想。丰富自己的创作；一方面运用自己的文艺修养，进行新民歌的收集、选择、整理、加工和推广工作，帮助群众提高文艺创作的水平，学习古典诗歌的传统，吸取新诗的长处，推动新民歌运动进一步向前发展。整风以来，许多文艺工作者纷纷下乡下厂，帮助群众开展文艺活动，这种做法，应该继续坚持下去。
    关于民歌和其他文艺形式的结合，现在还只是初步尝试。从现有经验来看，实现这种结合，主要有以下几种方法：
    第一是民歌与绘画相结合。在前些日子，阜阳县王人乡开展了一个大规模的民歌和壁画的创作运动，他们的口号是：“墙有诗，诗有画，画里有诗，诗里有画，诗画合一，遍地开花。”在短短的十多天内，参加创作的有一千一百多人，共画了壁画一万六千多幅。其中有许多作品都具有我国优秀民间艺术传统的特色，充满了革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神。
    诗画结合起来，不但可以使民歌得到了具体形象的补充而增加了艺术的魅力；同时，也可以使绘画得到了语言的形容而大放光彩。王人乡这个经验，是值得十分重视的。其实，不仅壁画可以和民歌相结合，就是招贴画、连环画也可以和民歌相结合。所有这些，都需要我们在实践中加以创造。诗画结合，本来是我国绘画中的优良传统，历史上有许多诗人就是画家，画家就是诗人；也有许多诗人和画家互相协作，一个绘画，一个题诗，使诗画互相补充而增加艺术的效果。但是过去的诗既不是民歌，画也不是民画，还不能在群众中广泛流传。现在劳动人民不仅以新的民歌开拓了一代诗风，而且把诗画结合的传统继承下来，并且进一步加以发展。这充分表明了劳动人民掌握艺术的愿望和大胆创造的精神。
    第二是民歌与音乐相结合。民歌就是因为能唱才称为民歌的。直到今天，许多民歌仍然以各种各样的民间小调在口头上传唱，保持着这个传统的特点。像肥东县著名民间歌手殷光兰的创作，就是能读能唱的民歌。最近有不少音乐工作者为优秀的民歌配曲，这种做法，不仅使民歌更加生色，能够更广泛地流传，而且也使音乐工作者从民歌中找到了他们所要表现的内容，从群众的文艺创作里吸取了新鲜的血液。安徽省歌剧团吸收民间优美曲调的精华，为一些优秀民歌制作了乐谱，组织了一个“大跃进山歌联唱”，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。事实证明，民歌与音乐结合，是完全正确的。如果说乐谱是歌词的翅膀，那么歌词便是乐曲的灵魂。有了优秀的民歌，又有了优秀的乐谱，二者一结合起来，就可以收到更大的效果。今后我们一方面要提倡群众自编自唱，更广泛地用民间小调传唱民歌，另一方面还要提倡音乐工作者大量地为民歌配制乐谱，把群众性的民歌创作运动和群众性的歌唱运动结合起来，使民歌和音乐互相推动，互相提高，齐头并进地向前发展。
    第三是民歌和舞蹈相结合。载歌载舞，是我国人民形容欢乐景象惯用的语言，歌舞之间有着非常密切的关系。例如我省的传统舞蹈节目“花鼓灯”、“鵅鹑理窝”和地方戏中的很多节目，都是有歌有舞的。在安徽省第一届音乐周中，省艺术专科学校在表演“千里淮北变江南”民歌联唱等节目的时候，运用了古典的和民间的舞蹈表演的手法，收到了良好的效果。我们应该把载歌载舞的传统保持和发扬起来，使民歌不仅能唱，而且能够和舞蹈相结合，在歌舞的艺术上打开一个更新的局面。有些舞蹈工作者因为受了洋教条的影响，以为歌就是歌，舞就是舞，甚至主张硬把一些传统的歌舞节目统统变成单纯的舞蹈，这种做法是错误的，是应该批判的。
    第四是民歌与戏剧相结合。这个结合主要表现在两个方面：一个是可以从民歌中吸取主题思想；另一个是可以用优秀的民歌来丰富戏剧的唱词。在今年抗旱当中，巢县有这样两首民歌：“大红旗下逞英豪，端起巢湖当水瓢，不怕老天不下雨，那方干旱那方浇。”“千万蛟龙接上天，牛郎织女笑开颜，如今车干天河水，不等七七就团圆。”
    戏剧工作者根据这两首民歌和“管天管地管神仙”那一首民歌的思想，并加以丰富和补充，编成了“牛郎织女笑开颜”庐剧剧本。在这个剧本里，采取了许多优秀的民歌做为唱词，有的民歌是原样未动，有的是在原来的基础上加以适当的必要的改写，作者自己创作的唱词，也尽力学习民歌的优美的风格。这个剧有歌有舞，在音乐上也吸收了一些山歌和秧歌，揉合在原来的唱腔里，使原来的唱腔更加丰富。这虽然是一个初步的尝试，但是从演出的效果来看，可以说是成功的。从民歌“牛郎织女笑开颜”到庐剧“牛郎织女笑开颜”的创作，与从“长恨歌”到“长生殿”的创作，大体相像。这是民歌与戏剧相结合的一个很好的例子。庐剧既然可以这样做，其他剧种也可以这样做。今后随着叙事诗和故事诗式的民歌的大量出现，它必将成为戏剧取材的一个重要来源。只要我们继续努力，就可以使戏剧从民歌当中吸取丰富的营养，使戏剧的内容更加富有革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神，更加富有民族的和民间的特色。这对于戏剧的发展，是具有很大的意义的。
    第五是民歌和曲艺相结合。曲艺是广大群众喜闻乐见的一种文艺形式，它的活动范围很广。曲艺当中的鼓词、坠子、洋琴、快书等等，也大都是运用有韵律的群众语言，和较长的叙事体民歌很相接近。因此，民歌与曲艺的结合便是相当容易也是十分自然的事情。最近“安徽日报”副刊上发表的河南坠子“赶龙王”和“江淮文学”上发表的抗旱鼓词“吓死玉帝”，就是这样的例子。这两篇作品都吸收了民歌的特点，既可以当做民歌来朗读，又可以当做曲艺的脚本来演唱。这不仅使曲艺更加丰富，更加生动，也同样使民歌更加多样、更加活泼了。
    以上所说的这几种结合，有的已经做出了较好的成绩，有的还刚刚开始。在今后的实践中，必然会产生许多新的问题，要我们及时地研究和解决，但这种结合的方向，看来是完全可以肯定的。在这里应该指出的是，民歌是群众的东西，在使它与其他文艺形式结合的时候，也应该注意到群众性这一特点和其他文艺形式本身的特点。如果忽略了这一点，在工作上必然会走不必要的弯路。
    以上就是我对于安徽新民歌运动的一些粗浅的看法，是否正确，仅供大家讨论。新民歌运动的前途是非常远大的，它已经为我国诗歌的发展开辟了新道路，在今后还将发出更加辉煌的光彩。
