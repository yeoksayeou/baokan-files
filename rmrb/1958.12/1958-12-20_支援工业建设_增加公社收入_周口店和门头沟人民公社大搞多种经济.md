    Support Industrial Construction, Increase Commune Income
    Zhoukoudian and Mentougou People's Communes Vigorously Develop Diversified Economy
    (Our Dispatch) Zhoukoudian District of Beijing has recently launched a massive campaign to boost sideline production. This movement has not only vigorously supported the industrial and urban construction of the capital but also increased the income of various people's communes, providing favorable conditions for the commune's great leap forward in production next year.
    The first "battle" of this district's sideline production blitz concluded on the 13th of this month. In twelve days, a large amount of dolomite, red sandstone, river gravel, vitex, mountain poles, medicinal materials, and other sideline products urgently needed by national industry, urban construction, and the market were produced, generating a total income of six million yuan, equivalent to more than 30% of the total value of sideline production in the past eleven months. Currently, in addition to distributing a portion of the cash as wages to commune members and allocating a small portion as bonuses for advanced collectives or individuals on the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production fronts, the remainder is used as funds for large-scale water conservancy projects and next year's large-scale production. After a two-day break following the first "battle," 50% of the district's labor force was mobilized again on the 16th to launch the second "battle," which will last until the end of the month. This "battle" will further develop sideline production mainly based on building materials, livestock feed, and local specialties, according to the needs of the state and the market.
    Seizing the opportunity, opening up a wide range of avenues, properly arranging the labor force, and implementing "large-scale operations" are significant characteristics of this district's sideline production blitz. At the end of November, the Zhoukoudian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the favorable timing of the basic completion of autumn agricultural work, the large-scale water conservancy work yet to begin, and the ground not yet frozen and the mountains not yet snow-covered, conducted full ideological mobilization among all cadres and commune members, organizing 75% of the district's labor force to blitz sideline production. The remaining labor force focused on the preparatory work for water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and the finishing work of autumn harvest, deep plowing, and autumn grain storage. During the movement, commune members were in high spirits, collecting various rocks and local specialties all over the mountains. According to the distribution of resources, various people's communes carried out different divisions of labor based on the physical strength and technical skill of commune members. In order to solve the imbalance between the mountainous areas with many sideline avenues and the plains with few, the District Committee also organized some communes in the plains to establish sideline production bases in the mountains.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the sideline production blitz, the Zhoukoudian District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established temporary command posts from the district to the commune level. In the production process, from the District Party Secretary to the commune and team cadres, all went deep into the front lines, ate, lived, and labored with the masses, participated in production, led production, and solved problems in a timely manner. The industrial and commercial departments also organized a purchasing army of more than two thousand people to go deep into the front lines, producing and purchasing at the same time. The transportation department organized more than 140 trucks, more than 2,500 carts, wheelbarrows, and more than 6,900 livestock to participate in transportation.
    (Our Dispatch) Mentougou Commune in Beijing vigorously develops industrial and sideline production, developing a diversified economy, effectively supporting the capital's steel production and basic construction, and increasing the income of commune members.
    Mentougou District has many mountains and little land, and forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have always accounted for a large proportion of production. The commune was formed by the merger of fifteen agricultural cooperatives. It has a tradition of engaging in sideline production. The income from forestry, animal husbandry, industry, and sideline production accounts for more than 50% of the total income. There are about one thousand commune members who regularly engage in sideline production. This year, production seemed very busy, and the labor force was unprecedentedly tight. Almost all the original sideline production came to a standstill, and only more than one hundred carts were engaged in transportation, with a monthly income of less than forty or fifty thousand yuan. When the accounts of the fifteen agricultural cooperatives were merged into the commune at the end of September, there was only four thousand yuan in cash. At that time, the commune's economy was quite tight, and it could not even pay for the hundreds of iron shovels used for deep plowing. The living expenses of 33,000 commune members also needed to be solved by the commune. The Commune Party Committee calculated the accounts of income and distribution and found that due to the relaxation of sideline production, although agricultural production had increased, the income of some teams (formerly small cooperatives) had decreased instead. For example, the Dayu Production Team's agricultural income from January to September this year increased by 10,000 yuan compared with the same period last year, while sideline income decreased by 65,000 yuan, a difference of more than 50,000 yuan in total income. The Junzhuang Production Team's agricultural income from January to September this year increased by 21,000 yuan compared with last year, while sideline income decreased by 114,000 yuan, a difference of 103,000 yuan in total income. Therefore, if industrial and sideline production were not grasped in time, there would be a danger of reducing the commune's income this year. At the same time, the current production funds could not be circulated. For this reason, the Commune Party Committee decided to vigorously grasp sideline production from October. At that time, it was the busy season of the "three autumns," with tasks such as harvesting, deep plowing, wheat planting, fruit picking, and sweet potato digging being very busy, but the Mentougou Commune Party Committee resolutely extracted one thousand laborers to vigorously engage in industrial and sideline production. At this time, it was also the time when Beijing was vigorously developing steel, and a large number of refractory materials were needed. Yangpoyuan, Junzhuang, Nanxinfang, and other places in Mentougou Commune all produce refractory materials such as shale and clay. Production and sales are closely integrated. Within one month, the daily output increased from 40 tons to 1,000 tons. In October, industrial and sideline production generated a total income of 460,000 yuan, 130,000 yuan of cotton clothes were issued to commune members, and 20,000 yuan of pocket money was issued. The morale of commune members was high. In November, the labor force participating in industrial and sideline production increased to 2,000 people, and the income increased to 920,000 yuan. In December, the number of people participating in industrial and sideline production increased to more than 3,600. As of the 12th, 86,000 tons of refractory materials such as refractory materials and lime have been produced, with an income of 1.13 million yuan. In total, since October, in more than two months, more than 189,000 tons of refractory and building materials such as shale, clay, limestone, and lime have been produced, effectively supporting Beijing's steel production and capital construction. The total income from industry and sideline production is 2.51 million yuan. Adding the income from the first nine months and the estimated income by the end of this year, the annual income from industry and sideline production will reach 6.28 million yuan, accounting for about two-thirds of the total annual income of 9.2 million yuan. Now each commune member is allocated 99 yuan, an increase of 4.2% compared with 95 yuan per person last year, and the income per household is 417 yuan, an increase of 6.6% compared with 391 yuan per household last year. The distribution to commune members accounts for about 30% of the total income.

    支援工业建设  增加公社收入
    周口店和门头沟人民公社大搞多种经济
    本报讯  北京市周口店区最近展开了声势浩大的副业生产突击运动。这个运动既有力地支援了首都的工业和城市建设，同时也增加了各人民公社的收入，为公社明年的生产大跃进提供了有利的条件。
    这个区突击副业生产的第一个“战役”已在本月13日结束。在十二天中，生产了很多国家工业、城市建设和市场急需的白云石、红朱石、河光石、荆条、山杆、药材等副业产品，共收入六百万元，等于今年十一个月来副业生产总值的30％以上。现在各公社除以部分现金作为工资发给社员，并划出一小部分作为农、林、牧、副各生产战线的先进集体或个人的奖励金外，其余都作为大兴水利和明年大搞生产的资金。第一次“战役”结束后，经过两天休整，全区又发动50％的劳动力从16日开始投入了到月底为止的第二次“战役”。这次“战役”将进一步根据国家和市场的需要，大搞以建筑材料、牲口饲料和土特产品为主的副业生产。
    抓住时机，广开门路，妥善安排劳动力，实行“大兵团作战”，是这个区开展副业生产突击运动的一个显著特点。11月底，中共周口店区委根据秋季农活基本结束、大规模的兴修水利工作尚待开始和地未大冻、雪未封山的有利时机，在全体干部和社员中进行了充分的思想动员，组织全区75％的劳动力突击副业生产，余下的劳动力专搞水利建设准备、积肥和秋收、深翻、秋粮入库等收尾工作。在运动中，社员们情绪很高，漫山遍野地采集着各种山石和土特产品。各人民公社根据资源分布，在劳力安排方面，按社员体力强弱、技术高低进行了不同的分工，为了解决山区副业门路多、平原门路少的不均衡的问题，区委还组织一部分平原地区的公社到山里建立了副业生产基地。
    中共周口店区委为了加强副业生产突击运动的领导，从区到社都成立了临时指挥部。在生产过程中，从区委书记到社、队干部，都深入现场，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，参加生产，领导生产，发现问题，及时解决。工、商业部门还组织了两千多人的收购大军，深入现场，边生产，边收购。运输部门组织了一百四十多辆汽车、二千五百多辆大车、手推车和六千九百多头牲畜参加了运输。
    本报讯  北京市门头沟公社大搞工业和副业生产，发展多种经济，有力地支援了首都的钢铁生产和基本建设，并增加了社员收入。
    门头沟区山多地少，林牧副业一向在生产中占很大的比重。公社由十五个农业社合并而成，搞副业一向有传统，林牧工副业收入占总收入50％以上，经常搞副业生产的社员有一千人左右。今年看来生产十分繁忙，劳力空前紧张。原有搞副业的几乎全部停顿，只有一百多辆大车在搞运输，每月收入不足四、五万元。9月底十五个农业社账目合并到公社时现金只有四千元。当时公社经济相当紧张，连买深翻地用的几百把铁锹的钱都付不出。而三万三千社员的生活费用也需公社解决。公社党委会算了一下收入和分配的账，发现由于放松了副业，农业生产虽有增加，但有些队（原小社）的收入反而减少。如大峪生产队今年1至9月农业收入比去年同时期增加了一万元，而副业收入减少了六万五千元，总收入相差五万多元。军庄生产队今年1至9月农业收入较去年增加二万一千元，副业收入少十一万四千元，总收入相差十万零三千元。因此如果再不及时抓紧工副业生产，今年公社收入有减低的危险。同时目前的生产资金也无法周转。为此公社党委决议自10月起大抓副业。当时正是三秋紧张时期，收秋、深翻地、种麦、摘水果、挖白薯等任务十分繁忙，但是门头沟公社党委还是毅然抽出一千个劳力大搞工业和副业。这时也正是北京市大搞钢铁的时候，需要大批耐火材料。门头沟公社杨坡园、军庄、南辛房等处都出产页腊石、粘土等耐火材料，产销密切结合，一个月内即由日产四十吨上升到日产千吨。10月份工副业共收入四十六万元，给社员发了十三万元棉衣款，零用钱发了二万元，社员情绪高涨。11月份参加工副业劳力增加到二千人，收入增加到九十二万元。12月份参加工副业生产的更增加到三千六百多人。到12日为止，已出产耐火材料、石灰等八万六千吨，收入一百一十三万元。总计自10月到现在两个多月内共生产页腊石、粘土、石灰石、石灰等耐火材料与建筑材料十八万九千多吨，有力地支援了北京的钢铁生产与首都的建设。工业和副业共收入二百五十一万元，加上前九个月收入，以及到今年年底收入预计，全年工副业收入将达六百二十八万元，约占全年总收入九百二十万元的三分之二左右。现在社员每人分配九十九元，较去年每人九十五元增加4.2％，每户收入四百一十七元，较去年每户三百九十一元增加6.6％。社员分配占总收入30％左右。
