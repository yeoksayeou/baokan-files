(From our Wuhan dispatch on December 23rd) The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a field conference in Macheng, Hubei, from December 11th to December 15th, 1958. The central topic of this conference was to summarize and promote the experience of establishing small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods, solve the problems of forging, rolling, and metal products using indigenous and foreign methods, thereby enabling the small-scale indigenous steel production movement to enter a new stage of consolidation and improvement.

More than 300 representatives from relevant central departments and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the conference. The conference listened to reports by Lu Dong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and exchanged leadership and technical experiences in building small-scale iron and steel complexes in Macheng, Hubei; Shangcheng, Henan; Youxian, Hunan; Luzhai, Guangxi; and Guxian, Shanxi. After visiting the production practices of the Fenghuangwo small-scale iron and steel complex of the May Fourth People's Commune in Macheng and the Macheng First Machinery Factory, all the representatives also visited an exhibition hall with the participation of six provinces and one municipality, displaying more than 400 kinds of steel, machinery, and metal products made of indigenous iron and steel. The representatives unanimously reflected that this conference was very successful. Through vivid factual education and pragmatic discussions, the representatives further realized the profound significance of the Party Central Committee's "walking on two legs" policy and greatly improved their understanding of the broad prospects of indigenous iron and steel. They unanimously believed that the establishment of hundreds and thousands of small-scale iron and steel complexes combining indigenous and foreign methods is not only an inevitable trend for consolidating and improving small-scale indigenous steelmaking groups, but also provides material conditions for realizing the industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification of counties and people's communes.

After analyzing the new situation and new tasks of the small-scale indigenous steelmaking groups on the iron and steel front, the conference pointed out that: In the past few months, more than 60 million iron and steel soldiers have achieved brilliant results in ironmaking and steelmaking, playing a major role in ensuring the doubling of steel production ahead of schedule, but "having steel but no material" is still a major contradiction in current steel production. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in indigenous rolling, forging, and metal products to transform tens of thousands of tons of indigenous iron and steel into useful things, to make the small-scale indigenous steel production constitute a complete system, thereby greatly promoting the industrialization of the communes.

The on-site demonstrations and exhibitions at the conference gave the attending representatives great inspiration and encouragement. Through the visit, the representatives forcefully refuted the skeptical remarks that indigenous iron and steel have little use. They saw with their own eyes that indigenous iron and steel can not only be rolled into various profiles, plates, and wire rods, but also can be made into steel wire ropes, wire nails, small hardware, and various metal products, and can also be made into various indigenous machine tools, indigenous power, indigenous machinery, indigenous railways, and other machinery and tools. When the representatives saw the diesel engine and motor made of indigenous steel by the Macheng First Machinery Factory start to turn lightly, they all smiled and cheered. Indigenous iron and steel have emitted a strange and colorful light through a variety of products, and practice has proved that indigenous iron and steel have great potential.

The on-site visit also broke various superstitions, clarified the direction of consolidating and improving the small-scale indigenous steelmaking groups, and liberated people's thinking. The Fenghuangwo Iron and Steel Plant in Macheng County built a small-scale iron and steel complex including three workshops for smelting, rolling, and metal products in just seven days, which was an inspiration to everyone. What is even more thought-provoking is that the Macheng First Machinery Factory also spent only ten days using indigenous iron and steel and indigenous methods to successfully trial-produce a "Commune" brand universal simple rolling mill. In the face of such vivid facts, the representatives realized that: as long as we resolutely walk on two legs, rely on the masses, and break through the important barrier of "rolling steel into materials and making materials into implements," it is not so difficult.

Many representatives came from various counties and people's communes, and they were particularly excited about the issue of establishing small-scale iron and steel complexes. They believed that the experience in Macheng is applicable to all counties and people's communes with resources and transportation conditions. They said: The establishment of small-scale iron and steel complexes with rolling workshops not only solves the problem of the output of the large amount of indigenous steel that has already been produced, but more importantly, it solves the problem of the source of steel, machinery, and agricultural tools urgently needed by counties and people's communes. This creates a strong material foundation for carrying out a wide range of technical revolution movements in the vast rural areas. Finally, the conference unanimously believed that the rapid and widespread establishment of hundreds and thousands of small-scale iron and steel complexes in counties and people's communes with conditions will definitely take steel as the key link and greatly promote the industrialization of people's communes. This is a fundamental issue related to the fundamental interests of 500 million farmers and should not be ignored. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry announced at the meeting that it would rush to produce more than 100 small rolling mills and distribute them to various provinces in order to promote the early sowing and blooming of small-scale iron and steel complexes throughout the country. This decision was warmly welcomed by the representatives. (Attached picture)

### 巩固提高钢铁小土群  土洋结合突破轧制关  让小型钢铁联合企业成百上千

    巩固提高钢铁小土群  土洋结合突破轧制关
    让小型钢铁联合企业成百上千
    冶金工业部麻城现场会议为土铁土钢成材成器找到了广阔道路
    本报武汉23日电  冶金工业部在1958年12月11日至12月15日在湖北麻城召开了一个现场会议。这个会议的中心议题是，总结和推广建立土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的经验，解决了土洋结合的锻钢、轧钢和金属制品的问题，从而使小土群的钢铁生产运动跨入了一个巩固和提高的新阶段。
    参加这次会议的有中央有关部门及各省、市、自治区的代表共三百余人。会议听取了冶金工业部副部长吕东和中共湖北省委书记张平化同志的报告，并且交流了湖北麻城、河南商城、湖南攸县、广西鹿寨、山西故县等地建设小型钢铁联合企业的领导经验和技术经验。全体代表在参观了麻城五四人民公社凤凰窝小型钢铁联合企业及麻城第一机械厂的生产实况以后，又参观了有六省一市参加、陈列着四百余种用土铁土钢加工制成的钢材、机械及金属制品等产品的展览馆。代表们一致反映，这个会议开得很好。经过活生生的事实教育及务虚讨论，代表们进一步体会到了党中央“两条腿走路”的方针的深刻意义，大大提高了对土铁土钢广阔前途的认识。一致认为：建立成百上千个土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，不仅是巩固和提高小土群的必然趋势，而且为实现县和人民公社工业化和农业机械化、电气化提供了物质条件。
    会议分析了钢铁战线上小土群的新形势和新任务以后指出：几个月来，六千多万钢铁大军炼铁、炼钢，取得了光辉的成绩，对保证提前完成钢产翻一番起了重大作用，但“有钢无材”仍然是当前钢铁生产中一个主要矛盾。必须发动群众大搞土法轧钢、锻钢和金属制品，才能使数以万吨计的土铁、土钢变为有用之物，才能使小土群的钢铁生产构成为一个完整的体系，从而大大地促进公社工业化。
    会议的现场表演和展览给了到会代表很大启发和鼓舞。通过参观，代表们有力地驳斥了那种认为土铁土钢用途不大的怀疑论调。他们亲眼看到，土铁土钢不仅可以轧制成为多种型材、板材、线材，并且能够制成钢丝绳、洋钉、小五金多种金属制品，还能做成各种土机床、土动力、土机械、土铁路及其他机械和工具。当代表们看到麻城第一机械厂用土钢制成的柴油机和电动机开始轻快地转动的时候，一个个都笑逐颜开，欢声雷动。土铁土钢已经通过多种多样的产品放出了奇光异彩，实践证明了土铁土钢大有可为。
    现场参观还打破了各种迷信，明确了巩固和提高小土群的方向，解放了人们的思想。麻城县凤凰窝钢铁厂只用七天时间就建成了一个包括冶炼、轧钢、金属制品三个车间的小型钢铁联合企业，这对大家是一个启发。更引人深思的是，麻城第一机械厂也只花了十天工夫，用土铁土钢和土办法自己试制成功了一台“公社号”万能简易轧机。在这样生动的事实面前，代表们体会到：只要坚决用两条腿走路，依靠群众，突破“轧钢成材和制材成器”这一个重要关口，是并不那样困难的。
    有很多代表是来自各县和人民公社，他们对建立小型钢铁联合企业的问题感到特别兴奋。他们认为，麻城这里的经验，对一切有资源、运输条件的县和人民公社都是适用的。他们说：建立有轧钢车间的小型联合企业，不但解决了目前已经生产的大量土钢的出路问题，而且更重要的是，解决了县和人民公社迫切需要钢材、机械和农具的来源问题。这就给广大农村展开广泛的技术革命运动，创造了有力的物质基础。最后会议一致认为，在有条件的县和人民公社，迅速而普遍地建立起成百成千的小型钢铁联合企业，就一定能以钢为纲，大大地促进人民公社的工业化。这是一个关系到五亿农民的根本利益问题，不容忽视。冶金工业部当时在会议上宣布了再赶制一百多台小型轧钢机分送各省，以便促使小型钢铁联合企业早日在全国撒种开花，这个决定受到了代表们热烈的欢迎。（附图片）
