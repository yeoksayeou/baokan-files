Rice Paddy Catfish Farming

Catfish are a delicious fish, very popular in the market, and also an export commodity. This year, agricultural cooperatives in Longxi, Yunxiao and other places in Fujian Province have conducted trial farming, with yields of eighty to one hundred and fifty catties per mu. If feeding management is strengthened, the yield can be greatly increased.

The method of raising catfish in rice paddies is very simple. Just dig a few fish nests in the field, five or six feet deep and about two square meters in area. Pile small stones around it, build a wooden board on top, and cover it with thatch and mud. Leave a small hole five inches wide next to it as an entrance and exit for the fish. Rice can still be planted on the fish nest, which not only does not occupy rice planting area but also can increase income from fish farming.

Artificial Breeding of Seahorses Successful

The seahorse is a medicinal fish with high economic value and an export commodity, which has always been in short supply. The Shantou seawater aquaculture farm in Guangdong is experimenting with artificial breeding of seahorses. The large seahorses being tested have now produced offspring for the fifth time. According to experiments, each seahorse can produce offspring more than eight times a year, generally producing 100 offspring each time, with a maximum of 3,000. They can be harvested in three months. Each mu can stock 75,000 to 150,000 fry each time, and the annual output value per mu of water surface can reach 1,650 yuan.

Artificial Shark Farming

Sharks are marine fish with high value. The meat is edible, the skin can be made into leather, the liver can be made into cod liver oil, and the fins can be made into valuable shark fins. In the past, sharks were always caught naturally. This year, in the great leap forward, Leidong County in Guangdong Province broke through superstition and stocked 37 shark fry weighing four to seven catties in the shankxiwei caokuai enclosure in April; they were mixed with eagle rays (Yan rays, yellow rays), and the survival rate reached 100%. They also grew very quickly. After four months, each shark had grown to forty to sixty catties. Some sharks have already begun to reproduce.

Pearls Are No Longer Hard to Find

Each of the coastal fishing production cooperatives in Hepu County, Guangdong Province, raises pearl oysters. By the end of August, the fishing cooperatives in the county had raised a total of more than 11,300 pearl oysters.

Hepu's pearls have always been world-renowned. In terms of color, luster, and roundness, they surpass Japan's Dongzhu pearls and Europe's Xizhu pearls, and are known as the "King of World Pearls." According to historical records, Hepu's pearls were mined in the Han Dynasty, more than 1,700 years ago. However, in the past, the local area only had mining and no breeding habits, so pearls were sometimes abundant and sometimes scarce. In order to enrich the pearl source, in addition to building a pearl farm to raise pearls, the aquatic products department of Hepu Prefecture also mobilized coastal fishing cooperatives to vigorously develop pearl farming.

Freshwater Can Also Raise Prawns

Prawns, a famous product of our country, are migratory marine aquatic organisms, which are only caught in the coastal areas of Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei and other provinces in our country in spring and autumn each year.

This year, employees of the East Suburb Breeding Farm in Tianjin conducted trial farming in freshwater fish ponds and achieved initial success. They stocked more than 2,400 prawns with a body length of two to three centimeters in the fish pond and mixed them with carp, crucian carp, mullet and other fish. In more than a month, the body length generally increased by more than ten centimeters, which is faster than the growth rate in seawater and brackish water. This is another miracle in expanding the variety of freshwater aquaculture. They plan to further promote breeding next year and strive to supply the market in large quantities.

High Yield of River Crab Farming

Nanfeng People's Commune in Daishan County and Lecheng People's Commune in Yueqing County, Zhejiang, have successfully farmed river crabs artificially. Nanfeng People's Commune stocked 500 river crabs on May 23 this year. At the time of stocking, each crab weighed eight qian. Up to now, they generally weigh five liang, and the largest has reached half a catty. Lecheng People's Commune stocked more than 12,000 crab larvae from July 30 to August 5. Observation on October 5 showed that they generally reached seven liang, and the largest was nine liang, which was six to eight times more than when they were stocked. According to the records of Nanfeng Commune, crab larvae grew from eight qian to 1.2 liang in fifteen days, an increase of half. It is estimated that the yield per mu can reach 10,000 to 12,000 catties. Artificial breeding of river crabs has high yields, small investment, large income, and very convenient management. As long as you regularly check the feeding, women and semi-laborers can do it. There are many crab seedlings in Zhejiang and other provinces. (Attached picture)

    丰富多彩的水产养殖
    稻田养胡子鲶
    胡子鲶是美味鱼类，极受市场欢迎，也是出口商品之一。今年福建省龙溪、云霄等地农业社进行了试养，亩产八十斤到一百五十斤，若加强饲养管理，产量还可大大提高。
    稻田养鲶的方法很简便，只要在田里挖几个五、六尺深面积约二平方公尺的鱼窝，周围用小石块堆砌，上面架木板铺上茅草和泥土，旁边留一个五寸宽的小洞，作鱼的出入口就可以了。鱼窝上仍可插秧种稻，既不占种稻面积而且可以增加一笔养鱼收入。
    人工养殖海马成功
    海马是一种经济价值很高的药用鱼类，又是出口商品，一向供不应求。广东潮汕海水养殖场试验人工养殖海马，现在试养的大海马已经第五次产苗。根据试验，每只海马每年可产苗八次以上，每次一般能产一百条，最高的三千条，三个月就可收成；每次每亩可放养七万五千到十五万尾，每亩水面年产值可达一千六百五十元。
    鲨鱼人工养殖
    鲨鱼是海产鱼类，价值很高，肉可食，皮可制革，肝可制鱼肝油，鳍可制名贵的鱼翅。过去鲨鱼一向是靠天然捕捞，今年，在大跃进声中，广东雷东县破除了迷信，于4月间在山溪尾草块围共放养了四至七斤重的鲨鱼苗三十七条；与鯆鱼（燕鯆、黄鯆）混养，成活率达百分之百。成长也很快，四个月后，每条鲨鱼已经长到四十至六十斤。部分鲨鱼已开始生育繁殖。
    珍珠如今不难寻
    广东省合浦县沿海各渔业生产社，社社都养殖珍珠贝。到8月底止，全县各渔业社一共养殖了珍珠贝一万一千三百多个。
    合浦的珍珠一向闻名于世界，无论在色、光、圆润等方面都赛过日本的东珠和欧洲的西珠，有“世界珍珠之王”之称。据历史记载，合浦的珍珠开采于汉代，已有一千七百多年了。但过去当地只有开采，没有养殖习惯，因此珍珠时丰时歉。为了使珠源充裕，合浦专区的水产部门除兴建了一个珍珠养殖场养殖珍珠外，合浦县委还动员沿海各渔业社，大力发展珍珠的养殖事业。
    淡水也能养对虾
    我国的名产对虾，本是洄游性的海产水生生物，每年仅限于春、秋二季在我国山东、辽宁、河北等省的沿海捕捞。
    今年天津市东郊养殖场职工，在淡水鱼池里进行了试养，获得初步成功。他们将体长二至三公分对虾二千四百余尾，放养在鱼池里，和鲤、鲫、鮻等鱼一起混养。一个多月，体长普遍增长了十公分以上，较在海水和咸淡水中的成长速度还要快些。这是扩大淡水养殖品种的又一奇迹。他们准备明年进一步推广饲养，争取大量供应市场需要。
    养江蟹产量高
    浙江岱山县南峰人民公社、乐清县乐成人民公社用人工养殖江蟹成功。南峰人民公社在今年5月23日放养五百只江蟹，放养时每只八钱重，到目前止一般均有五两，最大的已达半斤。乐成人民公社自7月30日至8月5日共放养蟹苗一万二千多只，到10月5日观察，一般均达七两，最大的为九两，比放养时增加六到八倍。据南峰社记录，在十五天内，蟹苗从八钱成长到一点二两，成长半倍，估计每亩产量可达一万到一万二千斤。人工养殖江蟹，产量高，投资小，收入大，管理很便利，只要经常检查投饵，妇女、半劳力都能胜任。蟹苗在浙江等省很多。（附图片）
