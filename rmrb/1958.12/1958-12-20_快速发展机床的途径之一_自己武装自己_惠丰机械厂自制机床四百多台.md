    One Way to Rapidly Develop Machine Tools
    ——Arm Yourself
    Huifeng Machinery Factory Self-Manufactures Over 400 Machine Tools

    (Our report) Under the slogan of arming themselves, the Huifeng Machinery Factory in Shanxi has recently manufactured 439 various machine tools and equipment in the past two months. Among them are large gantry planers with an 8-meter stroke and watch lathes with a precision tolerance of no more than one-fourteenth of a hair.

    In the mass movement to vigorously develop mechanical equipment, the broad masses of workers have fully demonstrated their wisdom and drive, creating many machines and equipment that cost less money, took less time, and were more efficient. The Mechanical and Power Section of this factory was originally a repair and maintenance workshop, but because they broke down superstitions and everyone contributed ideas, they had manufactured 169 large and small machine tools and equipment by the end of November. Among them was an 8-meter large gantry planer. They also used a "Lincoln" milling machine imported during the Yuan Shikai era and a broken-down lathe, spending five days to manufacture two large combined boring machines. In the mass movement to vigorously develop mechanical equipment, the Tool Section even manufactured precision instruments such as micrometers, depth gauges, and universal protractors, which were rarely manufactured domestically in the past. Young workers in this section spent 76 hours modifying an internal grinder.

    During the design process, they adopted the method of workers and technicians jointly offering ideas and solutions, designing and drawing on-site, which solved many problems in production and design. For example, in the process of manufacturing the large gantry planer, because leading cadres were with the workers and technicians, they overcame the specific difficulties of "six no's": no large workshop, no design reference materials, no raw materials, no ability to cast large parts, no large processing equipment, and no lifting equipment, enabling the gantry planer to be manufactured in a period of nearly a month.

    快速发展机床的途径之一
    ——自己武装自己
    惠丰机械厂自制机床四百多台
    本报讯  山西惠丰机械厂在武装自己的口号下，最近两个月内，已经制出各种机床、设备四百三十九台。其中有行程八公尺的大龙门刨床，也有精密度不能差一根头发的十四分之一的钟表车床。
    在大搞机械设备的群众运动中，广大职工充分发挥了智慧和干劲，做出了许多花钱少、费时短、效率好的机器设备。这个厂的机械动力科原来是个检修和维护车间，可是由于他们破除迷信，大家献计，到11月底就制成了一百六十九台大小机床和设备。其中有一台八公尺大龙门刨。他们还利用在袁世凯时代进口的“林肯”铣床和破元车，花五天功夫，制成了二台大型组合镗床。工具科在大搞机械设备运动中，连过去国内很少制造的千分尺、深浅尺、万能角度等精密仪器，也制造出来了。这个科的青年工人用七十六小时改装了一台内圆磨床。
    在设计过程中，他们采用工人和技术人员共同出主意、想办法，现场设计、现场画图的办法解决了生产、设计中的许多问题。如在制造大型龙门刨的过程中，由于领导干部和工人、技术人员在一起，克服了无大工房、无设计参考资料、无原材料、无铸造大件能力、无大型加工设备、无起重设备等“六无”的具体困难，使这台龙门刨在先后将近一个月的时间内就制成。
