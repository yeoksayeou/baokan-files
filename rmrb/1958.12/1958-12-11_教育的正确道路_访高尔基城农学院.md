    The Correct Path of Education
    ——A Visit to the Gorky City Agricultural College
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng
    A little more than ten kilometers southwest of Gorky City, the flat open fields are covered with a thin layer of snow, shining white in the sunlight. Here, fields stretch one after another, the view is wide and open, and many fields have already been plowed, with piles of manure and soil fertilizer stacked on the ridges. It is easy to see that people are waiting for the spring planting.
    This is the "New Life" Farm. Laboring on the farm's more than four thousand hectares of land year-round are the students of the Gorky City Agricultural College - tractor drivers, combine operators, milkers, pig and chicken breeders, orchard gardeners, manager administrators, construction workers... The Gorky City Agricultural College is one of the earliest schools in the Soviet Union to implement the integration of education and production. The new teaching methods have enabled the Agricultural College to achieve remarkable success in training agricultural cadres who combine theory with practice.
    The Question Raised
    The Gorky City Agricultural College has a long history and rich teaching experience. For forty years, it has trained many outstanding agricultural technical cadres for the Soviet Union. The school has three departments: agronomy, agricultural machinery, and animal husbandry. There are 1,500 students and over a thousand correspondence students. Before the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the teaching at this college mainly consisted of lecturing on theory in the classroom and explaining "blueprints" in the laboratory. Due to the abundance of theory and the lack of practice, students memorized many formulas but did not know how to apply them. As a result, interns and graduates were unable to work well on the farms or solve practical production problems. Moreover, this kind of teaching, detached from life and production, created a phenomenon where students did not value manual labor and were unwilling to go to the countryside.
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU pointed out this serious phenomenon and once again indicated that education must be close to life and close to production. This instruction opened up a path for the Gorky City Agricultural College to solve the problem.
    At that time, when the party and non-party professors of the Agricultural College were discussing how to implement the spirit of the 20th Congress of the Party, they boldly put forward suggestions for reforming teaching methods: let students go out of the classroom to participate in labor production, and improve students through teaching that links production and theory that combines practice. Under the leadership of the Party committee and the principal, the new teaching method was first started in the Agronomy Department.
    The Gorky Oblast Party Committee strongly supported the Agricultural College's pioneering spirit and allocated the two farms in the suburbs, covering an area of ​​four thousand hectares, with more than four hundred dairy cows, thousands of chickens and poultry, pig and horse stables, and livestock farms, to the school for the implementation of the new teaching method.
    New Methods
    Because the Gorky City Agricultural College implemented the integration of education and production relatively early, the implementation of the new teaching methods went through a process of exploration, and initially took some tortuous roads.
    When the Agricultural College took over the farm in 1956, it was the harvest season. At that time, students were dispatched to the countryside in batches at irregular intervals to participate in harvesting labor. Students' participation in labor had neither fixed working hours nor fixed workloads, so they could not fully exert their enthusiasm, which affected production. After a winter, the farm suffered a loss of 440,000 rubles.
    What was the reason? The principal and professors conducted serious research and found the problem: they did not completely let the students do the work, the students worked, but they did not get enough trust, and they did not feel the responsibility they should have; at the same time, the labor organization was not fixed, which affected the quality of labor. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the school implemented a new method in the spring of 1957, that is, all farmland, machinery, and seeds were handed over to the students, and the students organized fixed work teams to independently and responsibly carry out labor production with the help of teachers.
    In addition to about three months of labor production time each year, students in each department continue to study theory at school according to their major, and the teaching content of theoretical courses has not been deleted. Two years of practice have proved that the method of combining teaching with labor production not only does not reduce the quality of theoretical teaching, but improves it.
    In Two Years
    The Gorky City Agricultural College has not implemented the method of linking education with production for a long time, but it has already achieved fruitful results.
    The students quickly mastered labor and production technology, and their enthusiasm was very high. Their ideological outlook has undergone great changes. When students went to the countryside to work in 1956, they could not get out of bed until eight or nine o'clock. What about now? At four o'clock in the morning, without ringing a bell or urging, everyone gets up to work, and no one is late. Earlier, when working in the fields, they wanted to stop working when it drizzled, but this year, during the spring sowing and summer harvesting seasons, it rained heavily all day, and no one wanted to leave their posts. Earlier, when they saw cattle pens and pigsties, they complained that they were dirty, but now, some students are unwilling to leave the dairy cows for a moment. Earlier, some students always wanted to stay in the city to engage in research work after graduation, but today, students are voluntarily going to the countryside to become milkers, agricultural technicians...
    We visited Kuflyokin and Lyusha, fourth-year students of the Agronomy Department, who are known throughout the school for their good work. They humbly told us about their thoughts and feelings. Lyusha said: "To be honest, labor production was difficult at the beginning. For example, each student was required to dig 800 kilograms of potatoes in an eight-hour shift. In the first two days, we only dug 400 kilograms, 600 kilograms, and our backs were already sore. What to do? Can we not continue? Of course not. In this way, we cultivated a strong will in difficulties, and we grew up in labor. After that, we worked hard and actively, and we dug more than a thousand kilograms of potatoes every day."
    "Science originates in labor practice," "We must use science and technology and labor hands to improve the production of the 'New Life' Farm." This is the slogan and goal put forward by the students of the Gorky City Agricultural College in labor. In fact, this is exactly the case. The appearance of the "New Life" Farm has also changed with the students' careful management and labor production. For example, in milk production, the average milk yield per dairy cow in 1956 was 3,200 kilograms, which increased to 4,000 kilograms in 1957, and to 4,500 to 5,000 kilograms in 1958. In grain production, the average yield per hectare in 1956 was 1.6 metric tons, which increased to an average of 1.7 to 1.9 metric tons in 1957 and 1958, and the yield per hectare in many cultivated lands increased to 2.5 metric tons. Fruit production has more than doubled. If, two years ago, the "New Life" Farm was only run at a general level, then this year, the "New Life" Farm is one of the best farms in the entire Gorky Oblast, whether in terms of milk or various crop yields.
    Further Ahead
    These days, the teachers and students of the Gorky City Agricultural College, like schools all over the Soviet Union, are enthusiastically discussing the outline of education reform. From their practical experience, the teachers and students believe that the education reform measures are necessary and correct. The Gorky City Agricultural College is discussing further improving the teaching content, and its experience is being widely promoted. Recently, one-third of the agricultural colleges in the Soviet Union (more than 30) have sent delegations to the school to visit and study.
    In order to completely solve the problem of linking teaching with production, the Gorky City Agricultural College has decided to move all its school buildings to the farm. The state has allocated 55 million rubles, and the construction of school buildings is now in full swing. At the same time, in order to expand students' participation in labor production and conduct more high-yield experimental fields, the Agricultural College will soon increase 4,000 hectares of land and 500 dairy cows, and more than 500 hectares of orchards near the "New Life" Farm. The Agricultural College plans to achieve self-sufficiency in college funding in the near future, while students are both working and studying.
    "For forty years," Dean Radikin said after accompanying us on a visit, "now, we have found the correct path of education." (Attached picture)

    教育的正确道路
    ——访高尔基城农学院
    本报记者  戴枫
    在高尔基城西南的十多公里，平坦的原野上复盖着一层稀薄的积雪，白皑皑地在阳光下闪耀着。这里阡陌连绵，视野开阔，许多耕地已经翻过土了，田埂上堆积着粪肥、土肥。一眼看得出，人们正等待着早春的播种。
    这就是“新生”农场。在农场四千多公顷土地上终年劳动着的，是高尔基城农学院学生——拖拉机手、收割机手、挤奶员、猪鸡饲养员、果园园丁、经理管理员、建筑工人……。高尔基城农学院是全苏较早实行教育与生产相联系的学校。新的教学方法，已使农学院在培养理论结合实际的农业干部方面取得了显著的成就。
    问题的提出
    高尔基城农学院是历史悠久、教学经验丰富的学校。四十年来，它为苏联培养了许多优秀的农业技术干部。全校共有三个系：农艺、农机、畜牧。在校学生一千五百名，函授生上千人。苏共二十次代表大会之前，这个学院的教学主要是在课堂里讲理论，实验室里“看图”讲解。由于理论多，实践少，学生记了许多公式，却不会应用。结果，实习生、毕业生在农庄不能很好劳动、不能解决实际生产问题。而且这种脱离生活、脱离生产的教学，造成学生不重视体力劳动、不愿下乡的现象。
    苏共二十次代表大会指出了这种严重现象，又一次指明教育必须接近生活，接近生产。这个指示，给高尔基城农学院开辟了解决问题的道路。
    当时，农学院党与非党教授在讨论如何贯彻党二十次代表大会精神时，就大胆地提出了改革教学方法的建议：让学生走出课堂去，参加劳动生产，在教学联系生产、理论结合实践中锻炼提高学生。在党委、校长的领导下，在农艺系首先开始了新的教学法。
    高尔基州党委会大力支持了农学院的首创精神，把原先城郊的两个占地四千公顷的农场和四百多头奶牛、成千只鸡禽、猪马厩、畜场拨给学校实行新教学法之用。
    新的作法
    高尔基城农学院由于实行教育与生产相联系比较早，新的教学方法的实施，经过了一段摸索的过程，开头走过一些曲折道路。
    1956年农学院接管农场时，正是收割季节。当时实行不定期的分批派学生下乡参加收割劳动。学生参加劳动既没有固定工作时间，也没有固定的工作量，因此不能充分发挥积极性，使生产受到了影响。一冬下来，农场经营亏本四十四万卢布。
    原因在哪里呢？校长和教授们进行了认真研究，找出了问题所在：没有彻底放手让学生干，学生劳动了，但得不到充分信任，感觉不到应有的责任；同时，劳动组织不固定，影响了劳动质量。为了克服这些缺点，1957年春天学校实行了新的办法，即把所有农场耕地、机器、种子全部交给学生，由学生组织固定工作队，在老师帮助下，独立负责地进行劳动生产。
    除了每年三个月左右的劳动生产时间，各系学生们照常按专业安排在校学习理论，理论课的教学内容没有删改。两年来的实践证明，教学与劳动生产相结合的方法，不但没有降低理论课教学质量，相反地是把它提高了。二年之间
    高尔基城农学院实行教育与生产相联系的方法为时并不算长，但已经取得了丰硕的果实。
    同学们迅速地掌握了劳动和生产技术，情绪非常高涨。思想面貌发生了很大变化。1956年同学下乡劳动时，时钟敲打八九下了，还起不了床。现在呢？清晨四点，不敲钟，也不要催，个个起床劳动，没有一个迟到的。早先在田间劳动时，下点把毛毛雨就想收工，但今年春播、夏收季节成天是倾盆大雨，谁都不愿意离开工作岗位。早先，见了牛栏、猪舍、就嫌脏，现在，有的学生不愿离开奶牛一步。早先，有的学生毕业后总想留在城里搞研究工作，今天，同学们都自愿下乡当挤奶员、农业技术员……。
    我们访问了由于劳动好而闻名全校的农艺系四年级学生克夫略金和柳霞，他们非常谦逊地跟我们谈起自己的思想感受。柳霞说：“说实话，劳动生产开头是困难的。譬如每个同学一班八小时规定要挖土豆八百公斤，头两天，我们只挖了四百公斤，六百公斤，已经腰酸背痛了。怎么办呢？能不干下去吗？当然不能。就这样，我们在困难中培养了坚强的意志，使我们在劳动中成长起来，之后，我们努力积极地干，每天就挖到了上千公斤土豆。”
    “科学产生在劳动实践之中”，“我们一定要用科学技术与劳动的双手提高‘新生’农场的生产”。这是高尔基城农学院学生在劳动中提出的口号与目标。事实上也正是这样，“新生”农场在同学们的认真经营管理与劳动生产下，面貌也随之改变了。譬如，牛奶生产，1956年每头奶牛平均产奶量为三千二百公斤，1957年则增为四千公斤，1958年增为四千五百至五千公斤。谷物生产，1956年每公顷平均产量为十六公担，1957、1958两年平均增为十七至十九公担，许多耕地每公顷产量增加到二十五公担。水果增产了二倍多。如果说，两年前，“新生”农场办得只有一般水平的话，那末今年，“新生”农场不论在牛奶或各种农作物产量方面，已是全高尔基州最好的农场之一了。
    再进一步
    这些天里，高尔基城农学院师生正像全苏各地学校一样，热烈地讨论着教育改革提纲。师生们从实际的体验中，都认为教育改革措施的必要与正确。高尔基城农学院正在讨论进一步改进教学内容，它的经验正在普遍推广。最近期来，全苏三分之一的农学院（三十多个）已派来了代表团到该校参观学习。
    高尔基城农学院为了彻底解决教学与生产相联系的问题，已决定将全部校舍迁往农场，国家已拨给了五千五百万卢布，目前校舍建设工程正在全面进行。同时，为了扩大同学参加劳动生产，多搞丰产试验地，不久，农学院将在“新生”农场附近增得四千公顷土地和五百头奶牛，五百多公顷果园。农学院计划在学生既劳动生产、又读书的情况下，不久的将来作到学院经费自给自足。
    “四十年来”，拉迪金院长在陪同我们参观后说，“现在，我们才找到了教育的正确道路。”（附图片）
