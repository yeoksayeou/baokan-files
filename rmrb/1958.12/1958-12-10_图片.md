Among the more than 400 livestock farms in the commune, 204 are sheep farms, raising more than 100,000 sheep. They pay close attention to sheep breeding, ensuring that all eligible ewes are mated and impregnated. This is a flock of sheep raised by the commune.

    河南省商城县超英人民公社大力发展集体饲养家畜家禽的生产。全社四百多处家畜饲养场中有二百零四处是羊场，共养羊十万多只。他们很注意羊的繁殖工作，对适龄母羊实现全配全受胎。这是公社饲养的羊群。
