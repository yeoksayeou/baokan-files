Xinhua News Agency report: In minority areas of Qinghai Province where nomadic peoples have settled, public canteens have been widely established, ensuring that the majority of herdsmen commune members eat their fill and stay warm, thus improving their lives.

After the implementation of people's communes in the pastoral areas of Qinghai, the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture built some adobe houses or prepared large tents for the public canteens. Many canteens in the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have heated platforms so that the elderly and children can eat while sitting on them. Many places also dug small coal mines and collected firewood to solve the problem of heating for commune members after they entered the public canteens. Thus, public canteens in pastoral areas sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. In Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture alone, 529 have been established, with 65,994 people participating, accounting for more than 90% of the total population.

The establishment of public canteens has increased the variety of food available to herdsmen. In addition to being able to eat their favorite fried noodles, ghee, curd, and buttered tea, they can also enjoy noodles, steamed buns, baked buns, vegetables, and seasonings. Some public canteens even make rice. Some elderly people and children can eat more milk tea and milk products in the canteen.

Xinhua News Agency report: In Hunchun County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, most of the work areas and production teams of the people's communes have people of Korean, Han, and other ethnic groups. After the county implemented people's communes, ethnic united canteens were also established one after another. The cooks are all Korean and Han women with high cooking skills elected by the masses. Each ethnic canteen can adjust the meals according to the dietary habits of the commune members of each ethnic group. The thirteen collective canteens in the Yili work area of the Ma Chuanzi Township Red Flag People's Commune always make two kinds of corn porridge: one is for Koreans, who like to add some salt; the other is without salt, which is preferred by Hans and Manchus. Korean commune members are not used to eating very salty pickles, while Han and Manchu commune members like to eat saltier pickles. The canteen prepares two different kinds of pickles to satisfy all the ethnic commune members.

    青海牧区大办公共食堂
    吉林珲春县食堂按各族社员生活习惯调剂饭菜
    据新华社讯  青海省已实行定居放牧的少数民族地区，普遍建立了公共食堂，使广大牧民社员吃饱吃暖，生活得到了改善。
    青海牧区实现人民公社化以后，海北藏族自治州为公共食堂盖了一些土坯房子或准备了大帐篷。黄南藏族自治州的很多食堂，都盘了热炕，让老年人和小孩能坐在热炕上吃饭。许多地方还挖小煤窑和打柴禾，解决社员们进公共食堂以后的取暖问题。这样，牧区的公共食堂就像雨后春笋似的成立起来，仅黄南藏族自治州就已建立五百二十九个，入伙的有六万五千九百九十四人，占总人数90％以上。
    公共食堂的建立，使牧民们的食物增加了新品种，除了能够吃到自己所喜欢的炒面、酥油、曲拉、寿茶以外，还有挂面、蒸馍、烤馍、菜蔬和调料等，有的公共食堂还做出了大米饭。一些老人和小孩在食堂可以吃到更多的奶茶和奶子。
    据新华社讯  延边朝鲜族自治州珲春县各人民公社绝大部分作业区和生产队，都有朝鲜、汉等族人民。全县实现人民公社化以后，民族联合食堂也纷纷建立起来，炊事员都是由群众推选烹调技术很高的朝鲜族、汉族的大娘们担任。各个民族食堂都能按照各族社员的生活习惯调剂饭菜。马川子乡红旗人民公社依力作业区的十三个集体食堂，在做玉米粥时总是做两样，一样是朝鲜族喜欢吃的，里面放些食盐；另一样不放食盐，是汉族、满族喜欢吃的。朝鲜族社员不习惯吃很咸的咸菜，而汉族、满族社员都喜欢吃较咸的咸菜，食堂就准备两种不同的咸菜，使各族社员都感到满意。
