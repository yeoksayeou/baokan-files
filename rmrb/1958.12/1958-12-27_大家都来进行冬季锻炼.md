    Everyone Should Participate in Winter Exercise
    Chang Tai
    We all know that a person's normal body temperature generally needs to be maintained at 37℃. Both excessively low and excessively high body temperatures can cause illness. Frequent physical exercise in cold weather can directly provide a good training for the body's heat production and dissipation mechanisms, thereby enhancing the body's ability to adapt to the cold environment. Therefore, it is often seen that some people who regularly engage in physical exercise, although wearing less clothing, rarely catch colds; conversely, those who rely on "fully armed" winter clothing to keep warm are most likely to get sick.

            Many Benefits of Exercise
    Some people may ask, how much benefit does physical exercise actually have? The answer: many benefits.
    People who regularly participate in sports activities rarely suffer from headaches, insomnia, poor appetite, and other ailments. They are always energetic, vigorous, physically strong, and have higher work and study efficiency. From a physiological perspective, their bodies are much stronger than those who have not received sports training. During exercise, all parts of the body controlled by the nervous system become tense, the heart beats with strength. An average person's heart pumps 60-70 milliliters of blood with each beat, while a regularly trained heart can pump 80-100 milliliters, or even more, each time; in this way, after completing the same blood circulation, the heart can get more rest, thereby reducing the burden on the heart. Similarly, the respiratory system also has great improvements. The air intake and outflow during exercise is five to six times more than usual. The development of respiratory muscles and the activity of the chest cavity are also strengthened accordingly. During physical activity, muscles receive more blood supply, are adequately nourished, and become thicker, more elastic, stronger, and contract more quickly; bones also grow faster and more firmly with blood supply; the functions of joints and ligaments are also improved accordingly.
    According to the proper needs of the human body, physical exercise should be carried out regularly, whether in the cold winter, the warm spring, or the crisp autumn. In particular, winter physical exercise has its own unique advantages, which is to cultivate people's greater fearlessness of cold and a tenacious will to overcome difficulties.

        Which Activities Are Suitable for Winter Exercise
    In winter, affected by the season, some activities are not suitable for outdoor activities. So, which activities are better to participate in?
    China has a vast territory, and although the North and South are in the same season, the climate varies greatly. Therefore, there should be appropriate choices in sports activities.
    In the South, it is not too cold, and various sports activities can be carried out as usual, but it is advisable to increase the amount of exercise compared to spring, autumn, and summer.
    What about in the North? Once the freezing days arrive, skating becomes the most popular activity among the masses; in the Northeast, participating in skiing is even more interesting. Skating and skiing in the cold air have great value for the body. Skating includes figure skating, speed skating, and ice hockey. People prefer figure skating because it has many changes, graceful postures, and is easy for beginners to master. Regular skating can not only exercise people's balance, speed, agility, coordination, and high level of skill, but also cultivate people's courage, tenacity, and alertness.
    In addition, you can also do long-distance running (especially cross-country running), kicking shuttlecock, skipping rope, martial arts, soccer, basketball and other projects outdoors in winter; if conditions permit, indoor exercises such as gymnastics, weightlifting, table tennis, etc., will definitely be very rewarding.
    Cross-country running, because it is running in the wild, will encounter fields, trails, forests, depressions, small river ditches, earthen mounds..., changes in the environment make it easier to arouse interest than running around in circles in the sports field, and the fresh air in the wild is more beneficial to physical health. Cross-country running does not require special venues and complicated equipment, so it is easily accepted by the masses.
    Here, we should also recommend skipping rope. This exercise is a whole-body movement based on the elasticity of the feet, making people more dexterous and alert. It is very beneficial for enhancing physical strength, reducing fat and transforming it into strong muscles, and promoting health.
    Skipping rope can be slow or fast, and it can be adjusted according to people's wishes and needs. Skipping rope is the easiest exercise to practice, and it can achieve a large amount of exercise in a short period of time.

          Pay Attention to Preventing Injuries
    In winter, due to the cold weather, the muscles of the body will contract under the stimulation of the cold, and the muscles will become stiff and the hands and feet will become inflexible. Therefore, you should do some moderate activities before exercise to warm up your body before engaging in more strenuous exercise, otherwise you may strain your muscles and joints. After strenuous exercise and sweating, do not take off your clothes immediately. You should go indoors to wipe off the sweat and change your clothes to avoid catching a cold. When participating in sports, it is best to wear sportswear. Overly thick cotton clothes and cotton pants not only hinder exercise, but also easily cause accidents. It should also be especially noted that you should not start physical training too vigorously, but should gradually increase the amount and intensity of exercise from small to large.
    Winter is the season to exercise our will. "Winter training in the coldest days, summer training in the hottest days" This kind of strong will is not only a quality that athletes should possess. Anyone who wants to have a healthy physique should be like this.

    大家都来进行冬季锻炼
    常态
    我们都知道，人的正常体温一般要保持37℃，体温过低、过高都会生病。而人的体温是由产热和散热来维持恒定的。在严寒日子里能够经常进行身体锻炼，就会直接给予体内产热和散热机构一种很好锻炼，从而增强了身体对外界冷环境的适应能力。所以，常看到一些经常进行身体锻炼的人，虽然穿戴不多，却很少着凉伤风感冒；相反，那些靠“全副武装”冬令衣服御寒的人，却最容易患病。
            锻炼好处多
    有人会问，体育锻炼究竟有多大好处？回答：好处很多。
    常参加体育活动的人，很少得头痛、失眠、饮食不良等病症，他们总是精力旺盛，朝气勃勃，体力充沛，工作和学习的效率都是较高的。从生理现象说明，就是他们的身体比未受过体育训练的人要强壮得多。运动时，神经系统控制的身体各个部分都紧张起来，心脏跳动有了力量，一般人的心脏每跳动一次，输出血液60—70毫升，经常训练的心脏，每次能输出80—100毫升，甚至还要多；这样，在同样完成血液循环后，心脏能够得到更多休息机会，因而减轻了心脏的负担；同样，呼吸系统也有很大改进，运动时出入的空气要比平时增多五到六倍，呼吸肌肉的发展，胸廓的活动能力也随之加强；体育活动中，肌肉得到更多血液的供应，营养充分了，肌肉也就粗壮起来，弹性增强，力量变大，收缩力更迅速；骨胳得到血液供应，也会长得快而牢固；关节和韧带的机能也随之改进。
    根据人体的正当需要看来，不管是严寒的冬天，还是春暖花开的春天，以及秋高气爽的秋天，体育锻炼应该是经常进行的。特别是冬季的体育锻炼还有独到之处，这就是能培养人们更不怕寒冷，和克服困难的顽强意志。
        哪些项目适合冬季锻炼
    冬天，受到季节的影响，有些项目是不适应户外活动了，那么，参加哪些项目较好呢？
    我国的国土辽阔，南北方虽然在同一季节，但气候却相差很大，因此，在运动项目上应有适当的选择。
    在南方，不太冷，各种体育运动项目都可照常进行，但是以比春、秋、夏的运动量加大为宜。
    在北方呢？冰冻日子一到，溜冰就成为群众最喜爱的活动；在东北，参加滑雪运动更是饶有兴趣。在寒冷的空气中进行溜冰和滑雪运动，对人体的锻炼价值是非常大的。溜冰有花样滑冰、速度滑冰和冰球等种类。人们多喜爱花样滑冰，这是因为它的变化多，姿态优美，而且初学者容易掌握。经常滑冰，不但可以锻炼人的平衡、速度、灵敏、协调和高度的技巧性，而且可以培养人的勇敢、顽强和机警等优良品质。
    另外，冬季在室外还可以进行长跑（尤其是越野跑）、踢毽子、跳绳、武术、足球、篮球等项目；如果条件允许，在室内练习器械操、举重、乒乓球等，收效定会很好。
    越野跑，因为是在野外跑步，会遇到田野、羊肠小道、树林、洼地、小河沟、土岗……，环境的变化，比在运动场围着圈子转容易引起兴趣，而且野外的空气新鲜，对身体的健康更有益处。练习越野跑不需要特殊场地和复杂用具，因此，也易被群众所接受。
    在这里，还应向大家推荐跳绳运动。这项运动是以足部的弹力为主的全身运动，使人变得灵巧、机警。对增强体力，减少脂肪并转为健壮的肌肉，促进健康很有益处。
    跳绳可缓可急，它随人的心意和需要来调节。跳绳是最容易练习的项目，而且在短时间内能获得大的运动量。
          注意防止伤害
    冬季，由于天气冷，身体的肌肉在冷的刺激下是要收缩的，肌肉僵硬，手脚不灵活。因此，运动前应适量的活动，使身体发热后再投入较剧烈的运动中，否则会拉伤肌键和关节。在剧烈运动后出了汗，不要马上脱掉衣服，应该到室内把汗擦净，换上衣服，以免着凉。参加运动时，最好穿运动衣，过厚的棉衣、棉裤不但妨碍运动，而且容易发生事
    故。还应特别注意到，初参加身体训练不要太猛，应当从小到大，逐渐加大运动量和运动强度。
    冬天正是锻炼我们意志的季节。“冬练三九，夏练三伏”这种坚强意志不但是运动员应该具备的品质。凡愿意具有健壮体魄的人都应该这样子。
