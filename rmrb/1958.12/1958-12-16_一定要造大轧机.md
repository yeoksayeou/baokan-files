    It Is Imperative to Build Large Rolling Mills
    By the end of November, the staff of the machinery industry departments had completed more than one hundred sets of rolling equipment, and countless small, locally-made rolling mills. This considerable rolling equipment has powerfully supported the iron and steel industry. However, the vast majority of the newly-made rolling equipment is still small-scale. Medium and large-sized rolling mills with rollers above 650 millimeters and plate mills wider than one meter are few in number and unable to roll large steel, steel rails, steel plates, and steel pipes. These large steel materials are precisely the most important materials urgently needed at present. This situation indicates that in the rolling steel battle, the manufacture of large rolling mills has become a major stronghold on the road ahead, and we must resolutely conquer it.
    Relying solely on a small number of heavy machinery factories is not enough to manufacture large rolling mills; we must rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of large, medium, and small factories, working together. To conquer the stronghold of manufacturing large rolling mills, we must first break down the mystique and dare to undertake manufacturing tasks. Some comrades are often daunted by the large size and heavy body of large rolling mills. In fact, upon careful analysis, it is not difficult to understand that although they are large and heavy, we can completely adopt the method of decomposition, transforming the heavy into light, defeating them individually, and then piecing them together.
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in cooperation with Tsinghua University, manufactured a rail and beam rolling mill stand weighing 20 tons with a roller diameter of 800 millimeters under the condition of not having large casting equipment. Workers at Beijing Jianguo Rolling Steel Plant designed and manufactured a small rolling mill with a diameter of 400 millimeters. Since 1954, Angang has successfully applied nodular cast iron to large, medium, and small rolling rollers to replace forged steel and cast steel. Taiyuan No. 1 Rolling Mill Plant also used nodular cast iron to make a seamless steel pipe rolling mill stand with a diameter of 76 millimeters. These examples all eloquently illustrate that there is nothing mysterious about large rolling mills. As long as we dare to think and act, mobilize the masses, and vigorously promote the machinery industry's effective experiences in attacking the large with the small, such as "boiling" (using a teapot to boil a pig's head, meaning using small equipment for large tasks), "piecing" (breaking down the large into the small, piecing the small into the large), "substituting" (using casting instead of forging, using iron instead of steel), and "gnawing" (ants gnawing bones), even small and medium-sized machinery factories can manufacture large and medium-sized rolling mills even without large equipment.
    Of course, manufacturing complete sets of rolling equipment will involve many problems and encounter many difficulties. Here, promoting the spirit of communist cooperation is important. Organizing, cooperating, supporting each other, and learning from each other will increase our confidence and strength in overcoming difficulties. Three small factories in Harbin—Jiulian Machinery Factory, Qunli Machinery Factory, and the Preparatory Office of the Heavy Machinery Factory—with a total of less than 100 old machine tools and cranes of only 5 tons, and only three converters, united together and confidently guaranteed to make three sets of medium-sized rolling mills with a roller diameter of 650 millimeters before May 1st next year; and to make another seven sets before October 1st next year as a gift to the Party. They also used this to challenge heavy machinery factories in Fularji, Shenyang, and Taiyuan. What heroic spirit! We hope that all large, medium, and small machinery factories across the country will learn from their spirit and make achievements in conquering the stronghold of manufacturing large rolling mills.

    一定要造大轧机
    截至11月底，机械工业部门的职工已经完成了轧钢设备一百多套，各种小型的土轧钢机更是多不胜数。这许多轧钢设备，有力地支援了钢铁工业。但是，新制的轧钢设备，绝大多数都还是小型的，像轧辊在六百五十公厘以上的中、大型轧钢机和一公尺宽以上的板材轧机为数很少，不能轧制大型的钢材、钢轨、钢板和钢管。而这些大型的钢材，恰恰是目前迫切需要的最重要的材料。这种状况说明，在轧钢这场战役中，大型轧钢机的制造已成为前进道路上一个主要的堡垒，必须坚决地把它攻下来。
    制造大型轧钢机，仅仅依靠少数重型机器厂是不够的；必须大、中、小厂群策群力，一起动手。而要攻下制造大型轧钢机这个堡垒，首先就要破除神秘观点，敢于承担制造任务。有些同志往往慑于大型轧钢机的外型大和机身重而有所畏缩。其实，仔细分析一下，就不难了解：它虽然大和重，但完全可以采取分解的办法，化重为轻，各个击破，然后拼接起来。
    石景山钢铁厂同清华大学合作，在没有大型铸造设备的条件下，制造出重达二十吨、轧辊直径达八百公厘的轨梁轧机机架。北京建国轧钢厂工人自己设计并制成了直径四百公厘的小型轧钢机。鞍钢从1954年以来，就一直在大、中、小型轧辊上成功地应用了球墨铸铁，以代替锻钢和铸钢。太原第一轧钢机厂也用球墨铸铁制成了直径七十六公厘的无缝钢管轧机机架。这些例子都雄辩地说明，大型轧钢机并没有什么神秘的地方，只要敢想敢干，发动群众，大力推广机械工业在以小攻大方面所谓“煮”（茶壶煮猪头）、“拼”（化大为小，以小拼大）、“代”（以铸代锻，以铁代钢）、“啃”（蚂蚁啃骨头）等行之有效的经验，即使中小型机械工厂，在没有大设备的条件下，也是能够制造出大、中型轧钢机来的。
    当然，要成套地制造出轧钢设备，会牵涉到许多问题，可能碰到许多困难。在这里，发扬共产主义协作精神是重要的。组织起来，互相协作，互相支援，互相学习，将能增加我们克服困难的信心和力量。哈尔滨三个小厂——机联机械厂，群力机械厂、重型机械厂筹备处，全部设备只有不到一百台的老旧机床，吊车不过五吨，转炉只有三台，但是，他们一经联合起来，就满怀信心地保证要在明年“五一”前制成轧辊直径六百五十公厘的中型轧钢机三套；明年“十一”以前再作出七套，向党献礼。他们还以此来向富拉尔基、沈阳、太原等重型机器厂挑战。这是多么英雄的气概。我们希望全国各大、中、小机械工厂都学习他们这种气概，在攻下制造大型轧钢机堡垒的战役中奏捷立功。
