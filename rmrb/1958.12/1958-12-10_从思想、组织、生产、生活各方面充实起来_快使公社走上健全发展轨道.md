    Enrich from all aspects of ideology, organization, production, and life
    Quickly get the communes onto a healthy development track
    Guizhou inspection team dismounts to examine flowers and sets an example
    Heilongjiang starts with summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward
    Jiangxi seizes the main links to consolidate the communes

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, December 9th: The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a ten-thousand-person inspection team to assist the province's 1,806 people's communes in rectification, consolidation, and improvement.
    After realizing the people's commune system, Guizhou Province achieved tremendous results in the Great Battle for Steel and deep plowing for autumn planting, but it also brought about some problems within the people's communes that needed to be resolved. The inspection team will adopt the method of "dismounting to examine the flowers," combining it with the current central work in rural areas, starting with the issue of distribution, to help the people's communes solve problems existing in production arrangements, business management, organizational structure, and living welfare. The inspection team will help the local district committee run one people's commune well, making it a model so that this commune can drive all the people's communes to improve a step further.
    The inspection team is led by Wu Su, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, with seven bureau-level and higher cadres participating, and will depart in seven directions. They will start work in the people's communes before mid-December.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 9th: The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Provincial Rural Work Conference held from November 29th to December 7th, arranged the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. A mass rectification movement will soon unfold in the province's rural areas.
    This rural work conference determined that the rectification work should take socialist and communist education as its soul, focus on solving the problem of high-speed development of commune production, start with summarizing the experiences of this year's Great Leap Forward in production, raise the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, formulate next year's production plan, clarify several specific policies centered on the issue of distribution, improve the welfare of the masses, strengthen democratic management, and strengthen and rectify the commune organization.
    Currently, Heilongjiang Province's agricultural production army has投入(poured) into winter water conservancy construction, and about 60% of the rural labor force will be concentrated at various water conservancy construction sites. Therefore, the conference determined that the rectification work will adopt three methods: one is to draw out special forces with the county as the unit and carry out in stages and batches in combination with production; the second is to have the county party committee make unified arrangements and carry out集中(concentrated) and分散(dispersed) simultaneously, advancing side by side; the last is to divide the battle lines and rectify separately. The county party committees will first earnestly summarize this year's work, affirm the achievements and criticize the shortcomings based on facts, mobilize the masses to speak out and debate, so as to formulate next year's production plan.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the rectification work, a ten-thousand-person inspection team organized by the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees will深入(go deep into) the rural areas of the province.

    This newspaper, Nanchang, December 9th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently made arrangements for rural winter production and the consolidation and improvement of people's communes at the Provincial Rural Work Conference.
    The meeting decided that from December this year to March next year, a large-scale movement to rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes will be launched, centered on winter production. The meeting called on all localities to grasp the following main links:
    1. Strengthen political and ideological work. Communist education must be carried out among the vast number of commune cadres and members, their communist awareness must be continuously improved, and the work of building the Party and the League, and rectifying the Party and the League must be done well.
    2. Earnestly do a good job in production management and labor management, make production plans, reasonably arrange labor forces, improve labor organization, implement and consolidate the production responsibility system, deeply carry out the technological revolution, and continuously improve labor efficiency. The people's communes must implement the principle of democratic centralism, and achieve "military organization, combat action, collective production, and democratic management."
    3. Do a good job in distribution. This year's distribution principle should be to increase both public accumulation and the income of commune members, and continuously improve the people's living standards.
    4. Do a good job in life and public welfare undertakings. It is necessary to appropriately arrange the time for commune members to work, study, and rest, and to earnestly run public welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has decided to transfer 10,000 cadres from party and government leading organs and mass organizations at all levels to深入(go deep into) the rural areas to assist various localities in doing a good job in winter production and consolidating and improving the people's communes.

    从思想、组织、生产、生活各方面充实起来
    快使公社走上健全发展轨道
    贵  州  检查团下马看花树立榜样
    黑龙江  从总结大跃进的经验入手
    江  西  抓住巩固公社的主要环节
    新华社贵阳9日电  中共贵州省委组织万人检查团，帮助全省一千八百零六个人民公社进行整顿、巩固和提高。
    贵州省在实现人民公社化后，在大战钢铁和深耕秋种中都取得了巨大的成绩，但随着也带来了人民公社内一些需要解决的问题。检查团将采取下马看花的方法，结合当前农村中心工作，从分配问题入手，帮助人民公社解决生产安排、经营管理、组织机构和生活福利等方面存在的问题。检查团将帮助当地区委办好一个人民公社，做出样子，使这个公社能带动所有的人民公社都提高一步。
    检查团由省委书记处书记吴肃率领，有七名厅、局长以上干部参加，分七路出发。将在12月中旬以前到人民公社开始工作。
    新华社哈尔滨9日电  中共黑龙江省委在11月29日到12月7日召开的全省农村工作会议上，安排了整顿巩固人民公社的工作。群众性的整社运动即将在全省农村展开。
    这次农村工作会议确定，整社工作以社会主义和共产主义教育为灵魂，以解决高速度发展公社生产问题为中心，从总结今年生产大跃进的经验入手，提高干部和群众的思想觉悟，制定明年生产计划，明确以分配问题为中心的几个具体政策，搞好群众生活福利，加强管理民主化，健全和整顿公社组织。
    目前黑龙江省农业生产大军已投入冬季水利施工，各处水利工地将集中60％左右的农村劳动力。因此会议确定整社工作将分别采取三种方法：一种是以县为单位抽出专门力量，结合生产分期分批进行；再一种是县委统一布置，集中的和分散的同时进行，齐头并进；最后一种是划分战线，分头整顿。各县县委将要首先认真总结今年的工作，实事求是地肯定成绩、批判缺点，发动群众鸣放辩论，从而制定明年的生产规划。
    为了加强整社工作的领导，省委、地委、县委组织的万人检查团即将深入全省农村。
    本报南昌9日电  中共江西省委最近在召开的全省农村工作会议上，对农村冬季生产和巩固提高人民公社的工作作了安排。
    会议决定从今年12月到明年3月，以冬季生产为中心，开展一次大规模的整顿巩固与提高人民公社的运动。会议要求各地抓住以下几个主要环节：
    一、加强政治思想工作。必须向广大社干和社员进行共产主义教育，不断提高他们的共产主义觉悟，并做好建党建团和整党整团工作。
    二、切实搞好生产管理和劳动管理，做好生产规划，合理安排劳动力，健全劳动组织，实行和巩固生产责任制，深入开展技术革命，不断提高劳动效率。人民公社必须实行民主集中制的原则，作到“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生产集体化，管理民主化”。
    三、搞好分配。今年的分配原则，应当是使公共积累和社员的收入都有所增加，不断地提高人民的生活水平。
    四、搞好生活和公共福利事业。必须适当安排社员工作、学习、休息等时间，并切实办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等公共福利事业。
    江西省委已决定从各级党政领导机关和群众团体中抽调一万干部深入农村，协助各地搞好冬季生产，巩固与提高人民公社。
