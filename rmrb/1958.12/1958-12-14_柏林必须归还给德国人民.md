    The Soviet government's proposal on November 27 to end the foreign occupation of Berlin and make West Berlin a free city has attracted widespread attention from countries around the world. For more than half a month, there has been much discussion surrounding the Soviet initiative. People from all countries who sincerely care about peace in Europe and even the world, and who care about the fate of the German people, have unanimously expressed their support for this new measure proposed by the Soviet Union in line with its consistent advocacy of a peaceful solution to the German question. People can see very clearly through countless living facts that due to the Western countries, primarily the United States, pursuing a frenzied arms race policy in the thirteen years after the war, West Berlin has become a "cold war" center for imperialist and Bonn revanchist elements to carry out propaganda and subversion activities, and has become a bridgehead for the North Atlantic military aggressive bloc. The spearhead of aggression is directed not only at the German Democratic Republic, which bears the brunt, but also at the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp. Sober-minded people in all countries cannot disagree with the vivid and incisive conclusion of Soviet Premier Khrushchev: "West Berlin has become a malignant tumor. If this malignant tumor is not eliminated, there is a risk of very bad consequences." All countries also agree that ending the occupation regime in Berlin and making West Berlin a free city is the best painless surgical operation to remove this malignant tumor under the current realistic conditions. Even in Western countries, many newspapers and well-known figures who can by no means be considered "insufficiently anti-Soviet and anti-communist" have admitted that the Soviet initiative is "unassailable" and that Western governments must seriously consider it. For example, the famous American commentator Lippmann asked American officials to "re-examine the German situation without prejudice" and to consider "whether what was considered correct when Truman and Acheson, Eisenhower and Dulles formulated the current American policy toward Germany is still correct."
    However, from the leading figures of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany, there have been pronouncements that are completely out of tune with the people's calls for a reasonable solution to the Berlin issue. These figures have not only failed to seriously consider the Soviet initiative without prejudice, but have also tried every possible means to distort the Soviet proposal, using all kinds of sophistry to reject the Soviet proposal, and even taken the opportunity to poison the international atmosphere with the most blatant war cries. They hysterically shouted about a "Berlin crisis," about "occupation rights" in Berlin, about "adhering" to "obligations" to Berlin, and about "not unilaterally abolishing the Four-Power Agreement." Some figures who have been blinded by war mania, such as General Hodes, commander of the U.S. forces in Europe, have even frantically clamored that they "will not agree to any actions that hinder the movement of U.S. troops to Berlin."
    On December 11, TASS, authorized by the Soviet government, issued a statement on the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet proposal, sternly refuting the various absurd arguments from Western countries, and once again reiterated the Soviet government's firm determination to abolish the occupation regime in Berlin, and issued an unambiguous warning to those warmongers who clamored for the use of force on the Berlin issue, emphasizing that "Soviet troops are stationed in East Germany, not to point out the road to Berlin for Western countries." This reasonable and forceful statement by TASS is a dose of coolant for those who are not very clear-headed in Western countries, and also a wake-up call. The Chinese people fully support this statement.
    To this day, Western countries are still defending their completely untenable arguments. They say they want to "maintain the freedom of West Berlin." But what kind of "freedom" are they trying to maintain? This is the "freedom" for them to use their position and privileges as occupiers to build a "cold war" center in West Berlin, the "freedom" to turn West Berlin into an outpost for launching aggression against the German Democratic Republic, the "freedom" to drag all the people of Berlin, all the people of Germany, all the people of Europe, and even all the people of the world into war. With this kind of "freedom" of the imperialists, there is no freedom for the people of West Berlin. This is as obvious as the sun rising from the east. The American, British, and French imperialists have enjoyed that kind of "freedom" in West Berlin for a long time, almost fourteen years. Now it is time for the people of West Berlin to also enjoy freedom, and for them to become free people of a free city!
    Western countries also say that they "cannot unilaterally abolish the Four-Power Agreement." This is truly a shameless thing. If it comes to abiding by international treaty obligations, then, when it comes to "obligations," the first is the obligation to abide by the Potsdam Agreement concluded by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The Potsdam Agreement clearly stipulates that Germany should be completely disarmed and demilitarized, and that German militarism and Nazism should be prevented from reviving forever. This is the obligation of the four countries. The Soviet Union has faithfully abided by this obligation. But have the United States, Britain, and France abided by it? No, absolutely not. The memorandum published recently by the government of the German Democratic Republic on the threat to peace posed caused by the policy of arming West Germany and the White Paper on the aggressive policies of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany are the most powerful indictments of the crimes of the United States, Britain, and France in wantonly trampling on the Potsdam Agreement. From this, it can be seen that it is not others who are "unilaterally abolishing the Four-Power Agreement," but precisely the United States, Britain, and France themselves!
    In order to reject the Soviet proposal, the ruling groups of Western countries have also put forward an excuse, saying that the solution to the Berlin issue must depend on the solution to the German unification issue. For this reason, they have taken the tattered plan of so-called four-power negotiations to "unify Germany through free elections" out of the warehouse. The reason why the Western bloc is so obsessed with this plan is that it妄想wàngxiǎng (vainly hopes) to "unify" the German Democratic Republic into West Germany, and to "unify" the entire Germany into the North Atlantic Group. This is of course daydreaming! Germany is the Germany of the German people. The issue of unifying Germany can only be resolved by the people of the two now unfortunately divided Germanys themselves. No foreign country has the right to intervene. The Soviet proposal to end the occupation regime in Berlin is precisely to establish a good beginning for ending the occupation regime in Germany in the future, and to create the prerequisites for a peaceful rapprochement between the two Germanys in an environment free from foreign interference. To "unify" Germany under the condition of maintaining the occupation regime can only produce a result of raping the will of the German people, which not only the German people cannot tolerate, but also the people of the whole world cannot tolerate.
    The TASS statement once again shows that the Soviet government's determination to abolish the occupation regime in Berlin is unshakable. Foreign troops must withdraw from Berlin, the occupied state of Berlin must end, and Berlin must be returned to its master - the German people.

### 柏林必须归还给德国人民

    柏林必须归还给德国人民
    苏联政府在11月27日提出的关于结束外国对柏林的占领、使西柏林成为自由城市的建议，引起了世界各国的普遍注意。半个多月以来，围绕着苏联的这一倡议，议论纷纷。真诚关怀欧洲以至全世界的和平、关怀德国人民的命运的各国人民，一致表示支持苏联这一本着和平解决德国问题的一贯主张而提出的新措施。人们通过无数活生生的事实看得很清楚，由于西方国家首先是美国在战后十三年来所执行的疯狂备战政策，西柏林变成了帝国主义和波恩复仇主义分子进行煽动宣传和颠复活动的“冷战”中心，变成了北大西洋军事侵略集团的桥头堡；侵略的矛头不仅指向首当其冲的德意志民主共和国，而且也指向苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家。各国头脑清醒的人都不能不同意苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的这样一个生动的、一针见血的论断：“西柏林已经变成了一个毒瘤。如果不消除这个毒瘤，就会有导致十分不良后果的危险。”各国人民也一致同意：结束柏林的占领制度并且使西柏林成为一个自由城市，正是在目前的现实条件下割除这个毒瘤的最好的无痛外科手术。即使在西方国家，许多绝不能被认为是“反苏反共不力”的报刊和知名人物，也都承认苏联的这一倡议是“无懈可击”，西方各国政府必须予以认真考虑。譬如，美国的著名政论家李普曼就要求美国官方人士“无成见地重新研究德国情况”，并且考虑“在杜鲁门和艾奇逊，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯制定美国现行对德政策时所认为正确的东西是否仍旧正确。”
    但是，从美、英、法和西德政府的领导人物那里，却传出了同人们要求合理解决柏林问题的呼声完全不谐和的论调。这些人物不但没有无成见地认真考虑苏联的倡议，反而千方百计地歪曲苏联的建议，用种种强词夺理的借口来拒绝苏联的建议，甚至趁机用最粗暴的战争叫嚣来毒化国际气氛。他们歇斯底里地叫嚷什么“柏林危机”，什么对柏林的“占领权利”，什么“坚守”对柏林的“义务”，什么“不能片面废除四国协定”。某些被战争狂热冲昏了头脑的人物，如驻欧洲美军司令霍迪斯之流，更是疯狂地叫嚣什么“不会答应任何阻碍美国军队开往柏林的行动”。
    12月11日，苏联塔斯社受权就西方国家对待苏联建议的态度发表声明，严正驳斥了来自西方国家的种种荒谬论调，再一次重申苏联政府有坚定的决心取消柏林的占领制度，并且对那些叫嚣要在柏林问题上使用武力的战争贩子，提出了毫不含糊的警告，着重指出“苏联军队驻在东德，并不是为了给西方国家指出通向柏林的道路”。塔斯社这项有理有力的声明，对西方国家那些头脑很不清醒的人说来，是一贴清凉剂，也是一下当头棒喝。中国人民全力支持这项声明。
    迄今为止，西方国家仍然在替他们完全站不住脚的论点作辩解。他们说要“维护西柏林的自由”。但是他们所要维护的究竟是什么样的“自由”呢？这就是他们利用占领者的地位和特权在西柏林建立“冷战”中心的“自由”，就是要把西柏林变为向德意志民主共和国发动侵略的前哨阵地的“自由”，就是要把全柏林人民、全德国人民、全欧洲人民以至全世界人民卷入战争的“自由”。有了帝国主义者的这种“自由”，就没有了西柏林人民的自由，这一点就像太阳一定从东边升起一样的明显。美、英、法帝国主义者在西柏林享有那种“自由”已经很久，快十四年了，现在是到了应该让西柏林人民也享享自由，使他们成为一个自由城市的自由人民的时候了！
    西方国家还说什么“不能片面废除四国协定”。这真是不知人间还有羞耻事。如果说到遵守国际条约义务，那么，说到“义务”，首先就是遵守苏、美、英、法四国缔结的波茨坦协定的义务。波茨坦协定明文规定要使德国完全裁军和非军事化，永远防止德国军国主义和纳粹主义的复活。这就是四国的义务，苏联忠实地遵守了这项义务，而美、英、法三国遵守了没有呢？没有，绝对的没有。前不久德意志民主共和国政府发表的关于武装西德的政策造成对和平的威胁的备忘录和关于德意志联邦共和国政府的侵略政策的白皮书，就是对美、英、法三国肆无忌惮地践踏波茨坦协定的罪行的最有力的控诉书。由此看来，“片面废除四国协定”的，不是别人，恰恰就是美、英、法自己！
    西方国家统治集团为了拒绝苏联的建议，还提出了一个借口，说什么柏林问题的解决必须有赖于德国统一问题的解决，为此，他们又把所谓四国谈判“通过自由选举统一德国”的破烂计划从仓库中搬了出来。西方集团所以念念不忘于这个计划，就是妄想把德意志民主共和国“统一”到西德那里，把整个德国都“统一”进北大西洋集团里面去。这当然是白日作梦！德国是德国人民的德国，统一德国这样的问题只能由现在不幸分裂了的两个德国的人民自己去解决，任何外国都没有权利插手。苏联的结束柏林占领制度的建议，正是为了替将来结束德国的占领制度建立良好的开端，正是为了替两个德国在没有外来干涉的环境下的和平接近创造先决条件。在维持占领制度的条件下去“统一”德国，只能产生强奸德国民意的结果，不仅德国人民不能容许，全世界人民也不能容许。
    塔斯社的声明再一次表明苏联政府取消柏林占领制度的决心是不可动摇的。外国军队必须撤出柏林，柏林的被占领状态必须结束，柏林必须归还给它的主人——德国人民。
