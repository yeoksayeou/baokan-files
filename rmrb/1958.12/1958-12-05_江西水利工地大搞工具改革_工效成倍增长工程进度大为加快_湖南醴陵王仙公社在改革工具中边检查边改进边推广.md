    Jiangxi Water Conservancy Construction Sites Vigorously Carry Out Tool Reform
    Work Efficiency Increases Exponentially, Project Progress Greatly Accelerated
    Hunan Liling Wangxian Commune Inspects, Improves, and Promotes Tools While Reforming Them

    This newspaper, Nanchang, 4th, telegraph. A tool reform movement to solve the problems of backward tools and labor shortages is being enthusiastically launched at the more than 5,700 water conservancy construction sites that have already started construction in Jiangxi Province. At present, the province's 1.27 million water conservancy construction troops are working with soaring enthusiasm and high morale, creating miracles and reporting good news frequently. According to statistics from 43 counties in the province, as of December 1st, more than 400,235 semi-mechanized water conservancy tools have been manufactured and promoted, thereby rapidly increasing work efficiency. The average work efficiency per person in the province last year was 1.6 cubic meters, and this year it has reached 4 cubic meters, an increase of one and a half times. Last year, the average construction time for water conservancy projects of more than 10,000 mu was 100 days, and this year six water conservancy projects of more than 10,000 mu have been completed, with an average construction time of only 30 days.
    With the comprehensive development of water conservancy construction projects throughout the province, the transportation tool reform movement centered on ball bearings has also advanced to a new stage. After more than a month of hard work, the Feijiantan Reservoir in Yichun County has copied, created, and improved 26 kinds of advanced tools, reaching 3,326 pieces, basically achieving advanced toolization. The soil train they manufactured showed great power on the construction site, traveling smoothly on steep slopes, flat roads, and short and long distances. Using it, the work efficiency of transporting soil per person is more than 50 times higher than in the past when carrying it on the shoulders. The Zhangling Reservoir construction site implemented the method of using ox-drawn trains, and the soil transportation efficiency increased from the original 2.5 cubic meters per person per day to 992 cubic meters. Now, on large-scale water conservancy construction sites of more than 10,000 mu throughout the province, soil transportation and delivery generally use "three vehicles": ox-drawn trains, double-person handcarts, and soil trains, eliminating carrying on shoulders; soil compaction is also done with roller compactors, foot-operated automatic compacting rammers, and double-wheeled hand-held automatic propulsion damming devices. Therefore, the vast number of migrant workers have gradually been freed from heavy physical labor, greatly reducing labor intensity. On many large reservoirs construction sites such as Bayi, Qilihong, Feijianying, Hongqi, Zhangling, and Sushan, aerial "airplanes", ground "trains", and water "warships" come and go in an endless stream. When migrant workers describe their labor scene, they say: "Flying in the sky, pushing on the ground, it is not tiring to work, and the work efficiency is increased by five or six times", "Aerial soil transportation machine, flying high in the sky, transporting a load of soil back and forth, only takes a few seconds".
    The reason why Jiangxi Province can achieve semi-mechanized construction in the large-scale rush to build water conservancy projects is that party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership and timely summarized the creations of the masses, and universally imparted technology through on-site meetings. Party committees at all levels attached great importance to vigorously carrying out tool reform, and at the beginning, they grasped the central link of "learning advanced technology, reforming tools, improving labor organization, and improving work efficiency." In mid-November, the Nanchang Prefectural Party Committee convened an on-site meeting with representatives from all counties in the district, summarized and promoted the experience of advanced construction sites, and then a large-scale high-efficiency movement was quickly launched throughout the district, promoting more than 250,000 advanced tools in half a month.
    Factoryization of construction sites is the foundation for semi-mechanization of construction and solving the problem of equipment, therefore, many construction sites, while vigorously carrying out tool reform, rely on their own efforts, use local materials, and establish five factories on the spot: carpentry, ironwork, masonry, explosives, and cement. The province has established 450 cement plants, with a daily output of 1,000 tons of cement, which can basically be self-sufficient. In order to solve the shortage of ironworkers and carpenters, all parts of the province have adopted methods such as experienced workers leading new workers, masters leading apprentices; holding on-site training classes, military training at reservoirs, visiting demonstrations, using construction sites as schools, using projects as teaching materials; and mobilizing teachers and students from relevant schools to come to support, so as to quickly impart technology to the masses. As of now, the province has trained more than 54,000 technical workers. Because of this, the speed of water conservancy construction in the province has been greatly accelerated. (Zhang Zizhong)

    This newspaper reports that Wangxian People's Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province, has adopted the method of inspecting, improving, and promoting tools while reforming them, reversing the past situation where there were many inventions and creations but few promotions and uses in tool improvement, and basically achieved the goal of trying out one piece, appraising one piece, and promoting one piece. Due to the improved method of promoting tools, the difficulty of insufficient labor force in the commune's great leap forward in industry and agriculture has been overcome, making the commune's various productions lead the county, and it has won 24 red flags awarded by the county in the past two months.
    This commune was formed in September this year by merging four small townships and 71 agricultural cooperatives. Since vigorously carrying out tool reform in April this year, the 84 types and 12,756 pieces of tools invented and created by the entire commune have played a great role in solving the problem of insufficient labor force in spring plowing and production. After communization, due to changes in production organization and cadres, there was a time when no one was in charge of leading tool reform, which caused the once sensational tool reform movement to be in a state of stagnation. At the beginning of October, when the commune party committee studied the work for the fourth quarter, it found that more than 2.5 million workdays were lacking and could not be solved, especially in the tense autumn harvest and autumn planting in October, the number of workdays lacking accounted for 56% of the total number of workdays lacking in the fourth quarter. The commune party committee believes that the way out is to vigorously carry out tool reform. It was decided to launch a major inspection of the preparations for autumn harvest and autumn planting with tool reform as the center in the entire commune in early October. During the inspection, it was found that out of the more than 4,500 soil carts in the entire commune, 3,250 were not used; out of the 71 aerial transportation cableways, 57 were also stopped.
    The party committee analyzed that there were many reasons for the promotion of more tools and less use, the most important of which was that there was no one in charge of leadership. According to the inspection: Among the 14 production brigades and 82 small teams in the entire commune, 8 brigades and 46 teams had no one in charge of this work. Secondly, the specifications and quality of some tools did not meet the standards, and they were easily damaged when used. According to the inspection, among the unused tools, those with poor quality accounted for 40%. Again, many technologically complex tools are not used or accustomed to use by farmers. After analyzing and studying this situation, the commune party committee decided to first convene a three-level cadre meeting of the commune, brigades, and production teams, put out the labor ledger of the entire commune, and after discussion, unanimously believed that only by taking the road of tool reform can industrial and agricultural production soar, and further encourage everyone to vigorously carry out tool reform.
    After the meeting, the commune party committee established a tool reform committee, led by a deputy secretary, and the 14 brigades in the entire commune also established tool reform teams, led by the deputy secretaries of the brigade's general branch. The four joint factories composed of iron, wood, and bamboo craftsmen in the entire commune immediately formed 14 repair teams to carry out crash repairs of unqualified and poor-quality agricultural tools. Within five days, the task of repairing 6,540 unqualified agricultural tools was completed. Of the more than 8,200 sets of ball bearings in the entire commune, 40% were originally unqualified, and now they have been repaired and are all in use. In order to ensure that the agricultural tools manufactured in the future meet the specifications and quality standards, in addition to strengthening the ideological and political education of workers, the factory has also established a product appraisal system.
    After the meeting, the commune also used the method of vigorously launching mass movements to widely impart the use of technology. The methods adopted are generally to first train cadres of the commune's training brigade and production teams, and then let them take the lead in conducting experimental fields to make "examples." Doing so is not only conducive to overcoming the conservative thinking lurking in the minds of the members, but also can quickly impart the use of technology to the members. For example, when deep plowing, some members found it difficult to master the technology of rope-drawn tractors and deep plows, and the deep plows were often damaged due to improper use. After visiting the site in the commune, the captain of the Situ Brigade learned the technology of using rope-drawn tractors. After successfully taking the lead in using it, he immediately convened an on-site meeting of the entire brigade, so that more than 400 people mastered this technology. The entire brigade then realized the use of rope-drawn tractors and deep plows.
    After 15 on-site meetings and short-term training sessions, most of the members of the entire commune have become "all-rounders" in using new tools. All of the 84 types and 12,756 pieces of new tools in the entire commune that were originally left unused are now all in use. Because the invented and created tools can be promoted and used, the enthusiasm of the members to research and invent new tools has been further stimulated. New tools are constantly appearing in the entire commune, and according to incomplete statistics, there are now 199 types and 29,985 pieces of new tools in the entire commune, and it has basically been achieved that everything is promoted and every piece is used. Due to the vigorous development of tool reform, the entire commune's rush to harvest late rice was completed three days ahead of the original plan, and the entire commune's 17,000 mu deep plowing task was also completed.
    Recently, the Liling County Party Committee convened an on-site tool reform meeting in the commune, and decided to promote the commune's experience of combining invention, creation, promotion, and use in the entire county.

    江西水利工地大搞工具改革
    工效成倍增长工程进度大为加快
    湖南醴陵王仙公社在改革工具中边检查边改进边推广
    本报南昌4日电  一个解决工具落后、劳力紧张的工具改革运动，正在江西省已经开工的五千七百多个水利工地上热烈展开。目前全省一百二十七万水利建设大军，干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，奇迹不断，捷报频传。据全省四十三个县统计，截至本月1日，已经制造和推广的半机械化水利工具有四十万零二千三百五十多件，从而使工效迅速提高。全省去年每人平均工效是一点六公方，今年达到四公方，提高一倍半；去年万亩以上的水利工程每座平均施工时间为一百天建成，今年已经建成六座万亩以上的水利工程，施工时间平均只用了三十天。
    随着全省兴修水利工程的全面展开，以滚珠轴承为中心的运输工具改革运动也推进到一个新的阶段。宜春县飞剑潭水库经过一个多月的苦战，共仿制、创制、改良各种先进工具有二十六种，达三千三百二十六件，基本上实现了先进工具化。他们制造的土火车在工地上大显威风，陡坡、平路、长短距离畅行无阻。使用它，每人运土工效比过去肩挑提高五十倍以上。张岭水库工地推行了牛拉列车的办法，运土效率由原来每人每天二方半提高到九百九十二方。现在全省万亩以上的大型水利工程工地上，运土、送土，一般都采用了“三车”：牛拉列车、双人手推车、土火车，消灭了肩挑；打土也用滚轮压土器、脚踏自动压土夯、双轮手拦自动推进打堰器。因此广大民工们逐渐地摆脱了繁重的体力劳动，大大地减轻了劳动强度。八一、七里红、飞剑颍、红旗、张岭、苏山等许多大型水库工地上，空中的“飞机”，地上的“火车”，水上的“军舰”，南来北往，络绎不绝。民工们形容他们的劳动情景时说：“天上飞，地面推，干起活来并不累，工效提高五六倍”，“空中运土机，飞行高空中，来回运趟土，只要几秒钟”。
    江西省在大规模的突修水利运动中，所以能实现半机械化施工，是各级党委加强领导，及时总结群众的创造，通过现场会议普遍传授技术的结果。各级党委对于大闹工具改革非常重视，各地一开始就抓住了“学习先进技术，改革工具，改进劳动组织，提高工效”这个中心环节。中共南昌地委在11月中旬召开了有全区各县代表参加的现场会议，总结与推广了先进工地的经验，随后全区很快就掀起了一个声势浩大的高工效运动，半个月时间推广先进工具二十五万多件。
    工地工厂化是施工半机械化和解决器材问题的基础，因此，很多工地在大闹工具改革中，自力更生，就地取材，就地创办了木工、铁工、泥工、炸药、水泥等五个工厂。全省已办水泥厂四百五十座，日产水泥千吨，基本上可以自力更生。为了解决铁工、木工技术人员缺乏问题，全省各地都采取老手带新手，师傅带徒弟；召开现场训练班，水库练兵、参观示范，以工地为学校，以工程为教材；发动有关学校师生前来支援，把技术迅速地传授给群众掌握等办法进行培养。截至目前为止，全省共培养技术工人五万四千多名。正因为这样，大大地加快了全省水利建设的速度。  （张自忠）
    本报讯  湖南省醴陵县王仙人民公社采取边检查、边改进、边推广的办法，扭转了过去在改良工具上发明创造多，推广使用少的局面，基本上做到试制一件、鉴定一件、推广一件。由于改进了推广工具的办法，克服了这个社工农业大跃进中劳力不足的困难，使全社各项生产都在全县领先，在最近两个来月中，连获县里奖给的二十四面红旗。
    这个公社是今年9月由四个小乡、七十一个农业社合并建成的。今年4月间，轰轰烈烈大搞工具改革以来，全公社发明创造的八十四种、一万二千七百五十六件工具，对解决春耕生产中的劳力不足问题，起了很大的作用。公社化后，由于生产组织和干部的变动，一度出现没有专人领导工具改革，以致使轰动一时的工具改革运动处于停滞的状态。10月初，社党委会研究第四季度的工作时，发现缺少二百五十多万个工无法解决，特别是紧张的秋收秋种的10月份，所缺的工数就占第四季度缺的工数总数的56％。社党委会认为，出路还是在于大搞工具改革。便决定10月上旬在全社范围开展一个以工具改革为中心的秋收秋种准备工作的大检查。在检查中，发现全社四千五百多部土车，有三千二百五十部没用；七十一处空中运输索道，也有五十七处停了下来。
    党委会分析了工具推广多、使用少的原因很多，其中最主要的是没有专人负责领导。根据检查：全社十四个生产大队和八十二个小队中，有八个大队、四十六个小队没有专人领导这一工作。其次，部分工具的规格和质量不合标准，使用起来容易损坏。据检查，没有使用的工具中，质量不好的占40％。再次，许多技术性强的工具，农民不会使用也不习惯使用。社党委会分析研究这一情况后，决定首先召开社、大队、生产队的三级干部会议，将全社的劳动力账摆了出来，经过讨论，一致认为只有走工具改革的道路，才能使工农业生产振翅高飞，进一步鼓舞了大家搞工具改革的劲头。
    会后，社党委会成立了工具改革委员会，由一个副书记专门负责领导，全社十四个大队也成立了工具改革小组，由大队的总支副书记负责领导。全社由铁、木、篾匠组成的四个联合工厂马上也组成了十四个修理小组，突击修理不合规格和质量不好的农具。五天内，就把六千五百四十件不合规格的农具的修理任务完成了。全社八千二百多套滚珠轴承，原有40％不合规格，现已修好并全部使用起来。为了保证今后所制造的农具都合乎规格和质量标准，厂里除了加强工人的政治思想教育工作外，还建立了产品鉴定的制度。
    会后，该社又用大搞群众运动的办法，广泛传授使用技术。所采用的办法，一般是先由公社训练大队和生产队干部，然后由他们带头搞试验田，作出“榜样”。这样做，不但有利于克服潜伏在社员思想中的保守思想，也能很快把使用技术传授给社员。比如在深耕的时候，有些社员对绳索牵引机和深耕犁的技术难于掌握，深耕犁由于使用不得法，经常被弄坏。司徒大队的队长在社里现场参观后，学会了使用绳索牵引机的技术，在带头使用成功以后，马上召开了全大队的现场会，使四百多人都掌握了这项技术。全大队随着就实现了绳索牵引机和深耕犁化。
    全社经过十五次的现场会和短期训练后，使全社绝大部分社员成为使用新工具的“多面手”，全社原来摆着未用的八十四种、一万二千七百五十六件新式工具；现在全部使用起来了。由于发明创造的工具能得到推广使用，更进一步激发了社员研究、发明新工具的热情，全社发明创造和仿制的新工具不断出现，据不完全统计，全社现在已有一百九十九种、二万九千九百八十五件新式工具，并且基本上做到了样样推广，件件使用。由于工具改革的蓬勃开展，全社的抢收晚稻较原计划提前三天完成，全社一万七千亩深耕任务也全部完成了。
    最近，醴陵县委在该社召开了工具改革现场会，决定将该社工具改革中的发明、创造、推广、使用四结合的经验在全县范围内推广。
