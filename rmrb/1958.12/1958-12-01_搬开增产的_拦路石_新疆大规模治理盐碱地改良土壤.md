Removing the "Stumbling Block" to Increased Production
Xinjiang Undertakes Large-Scale Saline-Alkali Land Management and Soil Improvement

(Our dispatch) In the great leap forward in production, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are determined to remove the “stumbling block” hindering increased yields, and are carrying out a region-wide movement to manage saline-alkali land and improve soil in conjunction with the renovation of old irrigation districts.

Xinjiang is arid with little rainfall, and the soil contains saline-alkali components. The summer is hot, and the ground evaporation is high, easily causing salinization. At the same time, due to farmers' lack of scientific irrigation knowledge, the idea of "the more water, the better" is prevalent everywhere, causing the groundwater level to rise continuously, leading to soil salinization. According to a survey by the autonomous region's water conservancy department, 90% of the cultivated land in the existing irrigation districts throughout the region contains varying degrees of saline-alkali, which is very detrimental to production development. Taking Xinhe County as an example, 55% of the county's 340,000 mu of cultivated land are classified as low-yielding fields due to saline-alkali. Similar situations to Xinhe County exist to varying degrees throughout the autonomous region. In the southern Xinjiang region in particular, hundreds of thousands of mu of farmland suffer from alkali damage every year, greatly affecting the increase in yield per unit area.

In order to increase the yield per unit area, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have waged a long-term struggle against salinization. However, due to a lack of experience and scientific knowledge, saline-alkali land cannot be completely cured. In order to thoroughly transform alkali land, the autonomous region's water conservancy department requires all localities to combine with the already started renovation projects in the old irrigation districts, starting from the establishment of farmland drainage systems and the improvement of irrigation management, to carry out a widespread movement to fundamentally cure alkali land. This winter and next spring, farmers in various places will establish drainage systems in old irrigation districts with more serious salinization, excavate large numbers of farmland alkali drainage ditches and drainage channels, lower the groundwater level, and remove salt and alkali from the soil. In terms of irrigation management, various localities are adopting a series of improvement measures to implement planned water use and a rational irrigation system.

Soil improvement is a key issue for the autonomous region to strive for a grain yield per mu surpassing the Yellow River. All localities have appropriately arranged labor forces and listed this work as an important measure to achieve increased production. In order to realize the leap forward plan for increased production, farmers in the Kuerle Special Zone, where land salinization is more serious, are transforming 160,000 mu of low-yielding saline-alkali land into high-yielding fields.

The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has created many successful experiences in transforming saline-alkali land. All newly cultivated saline-alkali land on various farms is leached with water by planting rice, which not only improves the alkali land, but also enables barren land that previously needed to be leached before planting to obtain a harvest of about 400 jin of rice per mu in the same year. These experiences have now begun to be promoted to various places within the region. (Tan Feng)

    搬开增产的“拦路石”
    新疆大规模治理盐碱地改良土壤
    本报讯  新疆维吾尔自治区各族农民在生产大跃进中，决心搬开妨碍提高产量的“拦路石”，在全自治区范围内结合改造旧灌区开展治理盐碱地的改良土壤运动。
    新疆干旱少雨，土壤中含有盐碱成分，夏季炎热，地面蒸发量很大，容易造成泛碱；同时，由于农民缺乏科学的灌溉知识，各地普遍存在着“浇水越多越好”的思想，造成地下水位不断上升，土壤盐碱化。根据自治区水利部门调查，全自治区现有灌区90％中的耕地都含有不同程度的盐碱，对生产发展非常不利。以新和县为例，全县三十四万亩耕地中，就有55％盐碱地被列为低产田。自治区各地几乎都有不同程度的类似新和县的情况。特别是南疆地区，每年都有几十万亩农田遭受碱害，大大影响了单位面积产量的提高。
    新疆各族农民为了提高单位面积产量，同盐碱化现象进行了长期的斗争。但是由于缺乏经验和科学知识，仍不能根治盐碱地。为了彻底改造碱地，自治区水利部门要求各地结合已经开始的旧灌区改建工程，从建立农田排水系统和改善灌溉管理两方面着手，开展一个广泛的根治碱地运动。各地农民今冬明春将在盐碱化比较严重的旧灌区建立起排水系统，大量挖掘农田排碱沟和排水渠道，降低地下水位和排除土壤中的盐碱。在灌溉管理方面，各地正采用一系列改善措施，实行计划用水和合理灌溉制度。
    改良土壤是自治区争取粮食单产跨黄河的一个关键问题，各地都适当安排了劳动力，把这项工作列为实现增产的重要措施。土地盐碱化比较严重的库尔勒专区农民为了实现增产跃进计划，正在改造十六万亩盐碱化低产田为高产田。
    新疆生产建设兵团在改造盐碱地方面创造了很多成功的经验。各农场所有新开垦的盐碱地都用种水稻的办法洗碱，既改良了碱地，又使过去需要洗碱后才能播种的荒地，当年就可获得亩产四百斤左右稻谷的收获。现在这些经验已经开始向区内各地推广。  （谈风）（附图片）
