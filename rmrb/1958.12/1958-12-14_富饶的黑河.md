The Fertile Heihe

Readers: Do you know about the Heihe region in northern China? It is a prefecture in the northernmost part of Heilongjiang Province, bordering the Soviet Union to the north and extending south along the northern side of the undulating Lesser and Greater Khingan Mountains. This area is vast, the land is fertile, the forests are dense, the rivers crisscross, and the products and mineral resources are extremely abundant.

The Heihe region is rich in timber, and the material is of excellent quality. The forest area is 7.23 million hectares, accounting for 64% of the total area of the region; the timber reserves are approximately 700 million cubic meters, accounting for 43.7% of the total timber reserves in the province. This year, the state established a Forestry Administration in the Heihe region. After the newly built forestry bureaus are all put into production, they can produce more than 8.5 million cubic meters of timber for the state each year, which is almost equal to the timber production of all existing forestry bureaus in Heilongjiang Province. The Heihe region has always been the place in our country with the highest gold production. This year, it plans to produce 20,000 taels. It also produces valuable furs, such as mink, squirrel, ermine, muskrat, lynx, and otter, raccoon, etc. The highest annual output of precious pelts reaches 300,000 pieces, which have always been exported overseas and enjoy a high reputation in the international market. In addition, it is also rich in precious medicinal materials such as pilose antler, deer fetus, bear bile, and musk; fish products are also very abundant. Mountain goods and wild fruits are available everywhere. The wine brewed from persimmons here can be compared with the nationally famous Changbai Mountain wine. It is truly a good place where "you can knock a roe deer with a stick and scoop fish with a gourd, and wild chickens fly into the rice pot."

Within five years, the Heihe region will exploit and build factories and enterprises scattered like stars in the sky. The state will start construction of the Beihei Railway next year. The fertile Heihe will become a newly emerging and prosperous industrial zone.

    富饶的黑河
    读者们：你知道我国北方黑河地区的情况吗？它是黑龙江省最北边的一个专区，北与苏联接壤，南向绵延起伏的大小兴安岭的北侧。这里地域辽阔，土地肥沃，森林密布，江河纵横，物产矿藏极为丰富。
    黑河地区盛产木材，而且材质优良。森林面积为七百二十三万公顷，占全区面积的64％；木材蓄积量约七亿立方公尺，占全省木材蓄积量的43.7％。今年国家在黑河地区成立了林业管理局，新建的林业局全部投入生产后，每年可为国家生产木材八百五十余万立方公尺，几乎等于现有黑龙江省全部林业局的木材产量。黑河地区历来是我国生产黄金最多的地方，今年计划生产两万两。这里还出产名贵的毛皮，如元鼠、灰鼠、艾鼠、香鼠、麝鼠、猞猁、水獭、貉等，名贵皮张最高年产量达三十万张，历来都出口海外，在国际市场上享有很高的声誉。另外还盛产鹿茸、鹿胎、熊胆、麝香等珍贵药材；渔产也很丰富。山货野果遍地皆有，这里用柿子酿成的酒可与全国驰名的长白山葡萄酒相媲美。真有所谓“棒打獐子瓢舀鱼，野鸡飞到饭锅里”的好地方。
    黑河地区在五年内将开采和兴建起星罗棋布的工厂和企业。国家明年着手修建北黑铁路。富饶的黑河将会变成一个新兴的繁荣的工业区。
