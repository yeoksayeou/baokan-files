Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, said in an interview with the editor-in-chief of "Neues Deutschland" that the government of the German Democratic Republic warns against continuing to support those forces in West Germany and West Berlin who are now attempting to obstruct any efforts to ease the international situation on the Berlin issue in Paris and advocate further arming West Germany with atomic weapons.

Grotewohl said that West German Chancellor Adenauer is currently doing his utmost to dissuade Western countries from reaching a mutual understanding on the normalization of the Berlin situation, that is, on eliminating the most dangerous source of provocation in the heart of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic. Adenauer demands that Western countries reject the Soviet proposals and not use them as a basis for negotiations. Adenauer wants to maintain West Berlin as a center for provocation and disruption against socialist countries, as a "front-line city" in the Cold War. Therefore, he clings to the system of foreign occupation of West Berlin, hoping to drag Western countries and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into his adventurous policies. Grotewohl emphasized that such adventurous policies could lead to civil war in Germany and conflict between West Germany's allies and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

Premier Grotewohl made this statement in connection with the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Paris. He said that there is every reason to fear that the decisions of this meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states will further exacerbate international tensions. Because, so far, the decisions adopted at the meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states have always resulted in this.

Grotewohl said that the West German government is pursuing a policy of strength. It is now clearer than ever that the West German government, especially Chancellor Adenauer, is an enemy of easing international tensions.

Speaking of the Western countries' position on the Berlin issue, Grotewohl said that the attempt to preserve the occupation system in West Berlin can only lead to the shameful failure of the advocates of this policy. From the perspective of international law, the claim to occupy Germany has long lost any basis after the Western countries completely abandoned the purpose of the occupation—to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

Grotewohl pointed out that it is time to fully restore the German people's right to self-determination in Berlin. By eliminating the occupation system in West Berlin, it is possible to open a new stage in Germany's development, which will lead to mutual understanding between the two Germanys, the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, and thus ensuring European peace.

Premier Grotewohl said that the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly solemnly pointed out that the existence of further atomic armament plans for the Western European North Atlantic Treaty Organization armed forces and the West German Federal Defence Force is a dangerous challenge to peace and a serious blow to efforts to gradually resolve the disarmament issue and eliminate the danger of atomic war. The Federal Defence Force plays a major role in the implementation of these plans.

Grotewohl emphasized that the interests of the people of Europe require an immediate halt to the atomic armament of West Germany and a guarantee that the aggression of German militarism will not recur.

    格罗提渥警告北大西洋集团
    支持阿登纳冒险政策是危险的
    新华社柏林14日电  德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在对“新德意志报”总编辑发表的一篇谈话中说，德意志民主共和国政府警告不要继续支持西德和西柏林的这种势力：它们现在企图在巴黎阻挠在柏林问题上的一切缓和国际局势的作法，而主张进一步用原子武器武装西德。
    格罗提渥说，目前西德总理阿登纳竭尽全力劝阻西方国家不要就柏林局势正常化的问题，也就是不要就消除在爱好和平的德意志民主共和国心脏的最危险的挑衅策源地的问题取得互相谅解。阿登纳要求西方国家拒绝苏联的建议，并且不把这个建议作为谈判的基础。阿登纳想要保持西柏林作为对社会主义国家进行挑衅和捣乱的中心，作为冷战中的“前线城市”。因此他死抓住外国占领西柏林的制度不放，希望把西方国家和北大西洋公约组织其他国家也拉入自己的冒险政策中去。格罗提渥强调说，这种冒险政策可能引起德国的内战，并且使西德的盟国同苏联和其他社会主义国家发生冲突。
    格罗提渥总理是就北大西洋公约组织理事会即将在巴黎举行会议一事发表这篇谈话的。他说，担心北大西洋公约组织这次理事会会议的决定会进一步加剧国际紧张局势是完全有根据的。因为，到目前为止，北大西洋公约组织成员国会议上所通过的决定，总是造成这样的结果。
    格罗提渥说，西德政府在奉行实力地位政策。现在比任何时候都更加清楚，西德政府，首先是阿登纳总理是缓和国际紧张局势的敌人。
    格罗提渥在谈到西方国家在柏林问题上的立场时说，企图保存西柏林的占领制度只能导致这个政策的鼓吹者的可耻失败。从国际法的角度看来，在西方国家完全背弃占领的目的——建立统一、和平、民主的德国——以后，占领德国的要求早就失去了任何根据。
    格罗提渥指出，是应当完全恢复德国人民在柏林的自决权的时候了。通过消灭占领西柏林的制度就可能打开德国发展的新阶段，这个阶段将导致两个德国的互相谅解，导致对德和约的签订并从而保障欧洲和平。
    格罗提渥总理说，德意志民主共和国政府不止一次地郑重指出，西欧北大西洋公约组织武装部队和西德联邦国防军进一步原子武装计划的存在是对和平的危险挑战，是对于逐渐解决裁军问题和消除原子战争危险的努力的严重打击。在实现这些计划中联邦国防军起着主要作用。
    格罗提渥强调指出，欧洲各国人民的利益要求立即停止原子武装西德，并且保证德国军国主义的侵略不会重演。（附图片）
