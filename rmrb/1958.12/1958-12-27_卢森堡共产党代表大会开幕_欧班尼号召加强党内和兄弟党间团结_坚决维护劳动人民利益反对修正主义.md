Xinhua News Agency, December 26th dispatch from Luxembourg: The 15th Congress of the Luxembourg Communist Party opened on the 25th in Rumelange, a major industrial center in Luxembourg. Delegations from fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from France, the German Democratic Republic, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands attended the Congress.

    Aubry, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "The Tasks of the Party in the Current Situation." In discussing the characteristics of the current international situation, he pointed out that the capitalist camp is constantly weakening, while the strength of the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is continuously growing. The power of socialism is growing at an unprecedented rate. Aubry emphasized the great significance of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy.

    Aubry said that the working people of Western countries (including Luxembourg) should intensify their struggle to change the dangerous policies of their governments, which aim to promote the Cold War and create an atmosphere of hostility and hatred among the people of various countries.

    In his report, Aubry addressed the domestic political situation, pointing out that the current government crisis and dissolution of parliament are due to the Luxembourg ruling bloc's attempt to avoid satisfying the urgent demands of the working people. During the seven years of rule by the now-resigned coalition government of the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party, the lives of the working people of Luxembourg have deteriorated year by year. The economic recession that has emerged in various economic sectors of Luxembourg this year has placed a heavy burden on the working class and small landowners. The Luxembourg working people's dissatisfaction with their deteriorating situation and the government's policies is constantly growing.

    In discussing the upcoming election campaign, Aubry called on Communist Party members to expose the tricks of the exploiting classes and their political parties, and to fight for the united action of the working people. He briefly outlined the Communist Party's election program, which calls for an independent foreign policy, a policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries in the world, and the recognition of the People's Republic of China.

    In conclusion, Aubry called for strengthening Party unity and the unity of the Party with fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties in other countries in the struggle for peace and the protection of the interests of the working people. He also called for a struggle against the enemies of the working class—revisionism and sectarianism in all their forms.

    Delegates discussed Aubry's report, and speakers mentioned the increase in Party membership and the strengthening of the Party's influence.

    Usaldinger, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Luxembourg Communist Party, delivered a report on the second item on the agenda—"The Activities of the Communist Parliamentary Group." He said that the Communist parliamentary group had exposed the reactionary policies of the ruling bloc to the entire people. He supported the Communist Party's election program put forward in Aubry's report and called on the delegates to the Congress to actively promote this program among the broad masses of the people.

    The entire body of delegates welcomed with thunderous applause the congratulatory telegrams sent to the Congress by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and fraternal parties from other countries.

    卢森堡共产党代表大会开幕
    欧班尼号召加强党内和兄弟党间团结
    坚决维护劳动人民利益反对修正主义
    新华社26日讯  据塔斯社卢森堡消息：卢森堡共产党第十五次代表大会，25日在卢森堡的大工业中心鲁梅兰热市开幕。法国、德意志民主共和国、意大利、比利时和荷兰等兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团出席了大会。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会总书记欧班尼在会上作了“在当前形势下党的任务”的报告。他在谈到当前国际形势的特点时指出，资本主义阵营不断削弱，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量不断壮大。社会主义的威力正在以史无前例的速度不断地增长。欧班尼强调指出了苏联发展国民经济七年计划的巨大意义。
    欧班尼说，西方各国（包括卢森堡在内）的劳动人民应该加紧斗争，争取改变政府旨在鼓吹冷战和在各国人民之间造成敌对和憎恨气氛的危险政策。
    欧班尼在报告中谈到国内政治局势时指出，目前所以发生政府危机和议会解散，是由于卢森堡的统治集团企图逃避满足劳动人民的迫切要求。现已辞职的天主教党和社会党联合政府执政七年来，卢森堡劳动人民的生活一年年恶化。今年在卢森堡各个经济部门所出现的经济衰退，给工人阶级和少土地农民带来了沉重的负担。卢森堡劳动人民对他们境况恶化和政府政策的不满正在不断增长。
    欧班尼在谈到即将举行的选举运动时，号召共产党员揭露剥削阶级以及剥削阶级政党的手腕，为争取劳动人民的一致行动而斗争。他简略地叙述了共产党的选举纲领。纲领中要求实行独立的外交政策，实行同世界各国和平合作的政策，要求承认中华人民共和国。
    欧班尼在报告最后，号召在争取和平、维护劳动人民利益的斗争中加强党的团结，加强党同其他国家兄弟共产党和工人党的团结。他还号召为反对工人阶级的敌人——形形色色的修正主义和宗派主义而斗争。
    代表们就欧班尼的报告进行了讨论，大家在发言中谈到了党员人数增加和党的影响加强的情况。
    卢森堡共产党中央委员会书记乌撒尔丁格就第二项议程——“共产党议会党团的活动”作了报告。他说，共产党议会党团向全体人民揭穿了统治集团的反动政策。他支持欧班尼报告中提出的共产党竞选纲领，并号召代表大会代表展开积极工作，在广大人民群众中宣传这个纲领。
    大会全体代表以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎苏联共产党和其他国家兄弟党给大会的贺电。
