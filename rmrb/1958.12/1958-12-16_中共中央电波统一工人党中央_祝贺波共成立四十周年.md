Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The CPC Central Committee today sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, congratulating on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Communist Party. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party:

	On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, representing the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to you, and through you, to all members of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people.

	Since its founding, the Polish Communist Party has waged a heroic struggle for the interests of the Polish working class and working masses, and for the victory of socialism in Poland, writing a glorious record in the history of the Polish workers' movement.

	Over the past forty years, Polish Communists have experienced a tortuous and glorious path of struggle. In the harsh years of Pilsudski's reactionary rule, your party underwent arduous training in long-term underground struggles. In the years of the anti-fascist war, your party led the Polish people in a tenacious and difficult struggle against the Hitler fascist aggressors, becoming the most loyal defender of the interests of the Polish people. The offensive of the Soviet army, the battles of the Polish people and the People's Army, finally defeated the fascist aggressors, and the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish Communist Party, established the new Polish People's Republic.

	In the years after liberation, your party has won great victories in leading the Polish working class and the entire people in the struggle to build socialism. Recently, your party has achieved new successes in strengthening party unity, in fighting against domestic reactionary forces, in overcoming economic difficulties, improving people's lives, and in economic and cultural construction. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are very happy about the achievements made by the fraternal Polish United Workers' Party and the fraternal Polish people.

	We sincerely wish your party and the Polish people new and greater successes in further developing Poland's socialist construction, in consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the cause of unity of the international communist movement, in the resolute struggle against modern revisionism, and in the struggle to defend world peace and strive for human progress.

    在解放后的年代中，你们的党在领导波兰工人阶级和全体人民建设社会主义的斗争中，获得了伟大的胜利。最近你们的党在加强党的团结方面，在同国内反动势力作斗争方面，在克服经济困难、改善人民生活和经济文化建设方面，又获得了新的成就。中国共产党和中国人民对兄弟的波兰统一工人党和兄弟的波兰人民所获得的各项成就，感到十分高兴。
    我们谨祝你们的党和波兰人民在进一步发展波兰的社会主义建设中，在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动团结的事业中，在坚决反对现代修正主义的斗争中，在保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的斗争中，获得新的更大的成功。
