From Knot-Tying to Walls of Poetry: The Cultural Transformation of the Nu River Lisu People

(Our correspondent Huang Changlu reports) In the past, they relied on knot-tying; today, poetry fills the walls. The Nu River Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in the Yunnan border region has adopted the mass movement method to achieve a great cultural leap for the Lisu people in a short period.

In the past, the Lisu people in the Nu River area not only faced primitive and backward production methods, but were also culturally blank slates. Apart from a very few individuals who understood the writing used specifically for religious purposes, the vast majority of the masses were illiterate. At that time, they could only use knot-tying to record events or communicate, and they used fingers and corn kernels to calculate numbers, reading the veins on their palms to determine the months and years. This state of cultural ignorance created great difficulties for the Lisu people's production and life, especially during the cooperativization and the Great Leap Forward, where the difficulties were even greater. Many agricultural cooperatives used corn kernels dropped into bamboo tubes or marks carved on wooden sticks to record work points. Sometimes the corn was eaten by rats, or the wooden sticks were burned by children, and the accounts became unclear. Cadres in the cooperatives needed to grasp the overall situation in order to lead production, but they couldn't record the information reported by others and often forgot it, which affected their work. Without literacy, members also encountered great difficulties when learning science and technology.

In order to enable the Lisu people to break away from their primitive state of illiteracy and further promote production, the Party has sent many language workers to the Nu River area to work for several years, and helped them create a written language. The new Lisu script is a phonetic script created based on the language of the Lisu people, which is relatively easy to learn and can be mastered in a short period of time. However, at the beginning of the promotion of the Lisu script, some people mystified the language work, believing that only intellectuals could undertake this task. Some emphasized that a large number of teachers should be trained and formal night schools should be established before widespread literacy could be carried out. In short, they believed that literacy for ethnic minorities in the border areas could only proceed slowly, and could not be achieved with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee criticized these erroneous arguments and determined that as long as the mass line was implemented, progress could be made quickly. Under this policy, a large number of short-term training courses were set up throughout the prefecture, and more than 1,000 rural activists and primary school teachers were trained intensively as literacy teachers. They learned and taught simultaneously, teaching one group and then expanding to another. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to express the suffering caused by illiteracy and to debate the benefits of learning literacy. During the debate, the Lisu masses said: "In the past, the Han Chinese used 'golden characters' to count the years, and the Lisu people used the palms of their hands. Today, the Communist Party has created 'golden characters' for us, and we must learn them well!" Thus, a vigorous movement of "ten thousand teaching, everyone learning" quickly took shape. In the movement, the masses created many methods to resolve the contradiction between production and literacy time, and to overcome the difficulties encountered in learning. They posted alphabet charts and literacy cards everywhere in the fields and roadsides, and words were written all over the walls, doors, and even on ploughs and sickles. They learned during breaks, before and after meals, and even while walking, creating a new situation of "classrooms everywhere, the sound of reading everywhere." From August to October, nearly 70% of the 32,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people in the prefecture learned the Lisu script, and many elderly people also overcame illiteracy.

After the broad masses of the Lisu people mastered the written language, their production and spiritual outlook underwent rapid and profound changes. Agricultural cooperatives universally replaced the method of recording accounts with corn kernels and wood carvings with written records, and many young and middle-aged people who had just learned the written language took on the role of accountants. The Puluo Agricultural Cooperative also started a wall newspaper, and the members published their opinions, praises, and criticisms in big-character posters for the first time. Around National Day, when people's communes were established throughout the prefecture, Lisu peasants wrote applications using the written language they had just learned. The members of the Bilo People's Commune alone wrote more than 700 copies. Ba Huaqiang, a farmer from Mahadi Village, had a younger brother studying at Bijiang Middle School. In the past, he had to personally travel to the school to send money to his brother, which took four days round trip, affecting production. After he learned the written language, he wrote a letter at home and remitted the money to his brother. Creative writing groups, newspaper reading groups, and blackboard newspapers sprang up like mushrooms throughout the prefecture. In Bijiang County alone, the masses created more than 1,000 folk songs. (Attached pictures)

Now, Lahu farmers are already using the Lahu script to record work points (right picture). Wang Chuan'guo (photographer)

    昔日刻木结绳  今朝诗歌满墙  
    怒江傈僳族人民文化大翻身
    本报讯  记者黄昌禄报道：昨日刻木结绳，今朝诗歌满墙。云南边疆怒江傈僳族自治州采取群众运动的方法，在短期内使傈僳族人民文化大翻身。
    怒江地区的傈僳族过去不但生产处于原始落后状态，文化上也是一张白纸。除极少数人懂得专门在宗教上使用的文字外，广大群众都是文盲。那时，他们只好用刻木结绳的办法来记事或通讯，用手指头和玉米粒来计算数字，算年月看手板心上的脉纹。文化上的蒙昧状态，给傈僳人的生产和生活造成极大困难，特别在合作化和大跃进中，困难更多。许多农业社用玉米粒丢在竹筒里或用木棍刻划记号来记工分，有时玉米被老鼠吃了，木棍被小孩烧掉了，账就算不清。社干部在领导生产中需要掌握全面情况，但别人汇报的情况没法记下来，时常忘记，影响了工作。没有文化，社员学习科学技术时，也遇到了极大的困难。
    为了使傈僳族人民摆脱原始的文盲状态，进一步推动生产，几年来，党派了许多语文工作者到怒江进行工作，并帮助他们创造了文字。新的傈僳文是根据傈僳族人民的语言所创造的拼音文字，本来比较容易学，在短时间就可以学会的。但在推广傈僳文字之初，有人把文字工作神秘化了，认为只有知识分子才能担负这一工作，有人强调要培养出大量教师、办起正规的夜校后，才能普遍进行扫盲。总之，他们认为边疆少数民族的扫盲只能慢慢来，不能多快好省。自治州党委批判了这些错误论调，确定只要贯彻群众路线，就可以快。在这一方针下，全州开办了大量的短期训练班，突击训练了一千多名农村积极分子和小学教员当扫盲教师。他们边学边教，教会一批，再扩大一批。同时，发动群众诉没文化的苦，辩论学文化的好处。在辩论中，傈僳群众说：“过去汉族计年用金文字，傈僳计年用手板心，今天共产党为我们造了金文字，一定要学好！”于是迅速形成了“万人教，全民学”的轰轰烈烈运动。在运动中，群众创造了许多办法，来解决生产与扫盲时间的矛盾，来克服在学习中碰到的困难。他们在田间路旁遍插字母表及识字牌，在墙上，门上甚至在犁架和镰刀上，都写满了字，休息时间学，吃饭前后学，走路也学，形成了“到处是课堂，遍地读书声”的新局面。从8月到10月，全州三万二千多个青壮年文盲中，将近70％的人都学会了傈僳文字，不少老年人也摆脱了文盲状态。
    广大傈僳族人民掌握了文字工具以后，他们的生产和精神面貌迅速发生了深刻的变化。各农业社普遍用文字代替玉米粒和木刻记账的方法，许多刚学会文字的青壮年担任了会计。普洛农业社还办了墙报，社员们第一次用大字报发表自己的意见，进行表扬和批评。国庆节前后全州建立人民公社时，傈僳农民纷纷用初学会的文字写了申请书，仅碧罗人民公社的社员就写了七百多份。玛哈底村农民巴华强的弟弟在碧江中学读书，过去他要亲自跑到学校去给弟弟送钱，来回需要四天时间，影响了生产；他学会文字后，就在家里写一封信，把钱汇给弟弟。创作组、读报组和黑板报，像雨后春笋般，在全州各地不断出现。仅碧江县的群众，就创作了一千多首民歌。（附图片）
