Labor as the Main Task, Politics as the Guiding Principle, Integration of Labor and Military Affairs
Hangzhou Suburbs Cultivate Backbone Cadres to Consolidate Communes

    (Our dispatch) This newspaper reports that the Hangzhou suburbs of Zhejiang Province and the Xianfeng People's Commune in Longyou County are using the method of establishing Red and Expert Instructor Regiments and Instructor Battalions to cultivate backbone cadres and multi-skilled personnel who are both red and expert in the People's Communes. This is also becoming a shock force on the industrial and agricultural fronts, achieving significant results.

    The Red and Expert Instructor Regiments and Battalions in the Hangzhou suburbs and the Xianfeng Commune were established at the end of October and the beginning of November, respectively. Each term lasts half a month or one to two months. The first batch of participants were Party and League members and core militia members within the commune, mostly young commune members. The Hangzhou suburbs instructor regiment had more than 1,400 people, and the Xianfeng Commune instructor battalion had more than 200 people. The instructor regiments and battalions are personally led by the Party Committee Secretary. They are both labor and learning organizations, as well as military organizations, adopting a method that combines politics, military affairs, labor, and cultural education, with production as the main task, politics as the guiding principle, and the integration of labor and military affairs.

    The Red and Expert Instructor Regiments and Battalions insist on labor as the main task, and the trainees are production shock troops. After fifteen days of hard work, the Hangzhou suburbs instructor regiment completed the deep plowing and close planting task of 1,400 mu of high-yield farmland on time, and the quality fully met the standards. In the deep plowing and close planting, new agricultural tools such as electric rope traction machines, manual and animal-powered rope traction machines, seeders, and rollers were also comprehensively promoted. The Xianfeng Commune instructor battalion often helps backward teams catch up with advanced ones. Wherever there are difficulties, they go to help. When they learned that the late rice harvesting progress of the Lingshan Brigade was very slow, they immediately went to help harvest the rice, so that the harvesting progress of this brigade quickly caught up with the advanced brigades.

    The political and cultural studies of the Red and Expert Instructor Regiments and Battalions are closely integrated with production. They work during the day and study at night, learning while working. The learning methods mainly combine classroom instruction with free airing of views and debates, carrying out socialist and communist education at any time.

    The Xianfeng Commune instructor battalion also set up opposing viewpoints in their studies to carry out commendation, criticism, and self-criticism. For example, trainee Zhang Gengsong was picky and choosy in his work, emphasizing difficulties. The leaders of the battalion commended trainees Hong Guanghai and Xiong Meiying, who were active in labor and had great revolutionary enthusiasm, setting up banners. At the same time, they organized everyone to debate "What attitude should young people have towards socialism and communism? Can a labor attitude like Zhang Gengsong's build socialism?" After the debate, everyone was educated, and Zhang Gengsong also made great changes. When he helped the Miaoxia Brigade rush to harvest late rice, he was the first to jump into the knee-deep muddy winter fields to rush to harvest.

    The instructor regiments and battalions also actively cultivate young people to become multi-skilled personnel. The Xianfeng Commune instructor battalion now has a group of soldiers who have learned the wheat scale-back seeding method, and 40 trainees have learned general iron smelting technology, of which 10 have become iron smelting technicians. They also plan to build barracks and repair roads with their own hands. After repeated experiments and research, Huang Xiaogou and Lu Chungen, trainees of the Hangzhou suburbs instructor regiment, created the experience of a single person pushing a capstan, which greatly improved the efficiency of the rope traction machine.

    While working, the instructor regiments and battalions also use the time before and after work and during production gaps to conduct military training. After half a month of diligent study and hard training, the soldiers of the Hangzhou suburbs instructor regiment not only learned the formation, live ammunition shooting, but also overcame the habit of freedom and looseness, strengthened organization and discipline, and achieved the goal of subordinating all actions to orders and commands.

    The commune members who participated in the labor and study of the instructor regiments and battalions have become the backbone force of the commune, brigade, and production team after returning.

    Now, the Hangzhou suburbs and the Xianfeng Commune are summarizing the experience of how to run instructor regiments and battalions, and are preparing to establish instructor battalions and companies universally in communes and production teams.

    劳动为主  政治为纲  劳武结合
    杭州郊区培养骨干巩固公社
    本报讯  浙江省杭州市郊区和龙游县先锋人民公社运用建立红专教导团、教导营的方法，培养人民公社又红又专的骨干和多面手，同时成为工农业战线上的突击力量，收到了显著的效果。
    杭州郊区和先锋公社的红专教导团、营是10月底和11月初分别成立的，每期时间半个月或一、二个月。第一批参加的是公社内党、团员和基干民兵，大多是青年社员。杭州郊区教导团有一千四百多人，先锋公社教导营有二百多人。教导团、营都由党委书记亲自领导，它既是劳动和学习组织，又是军事组织，采取政治、军事、劳动和文化教育相结合的办法，以生产为主、政治为纲、劳武结合。
    红专教导团、营坚持以劳动为主，学员就是生产突击队员。杭州郊区教导团经过十五天的奋战，按时完成了一千四百亩高额丰产田深翻和密播的任务，质量完全合乎规格。在深耕密播中，还全面推广了新式农具电动绳索牵引机、人力和畜力绳索牵引机、播种机、镇压器等。先锋公社教导营经常帮助后进队赶上先进，哪里有困难，他们就到哪里去帮助。当他们知道灵山大队晚稻收割进度很慢时，就立即前去帮助割稻，使这个队的收割进度迅速赶上了先进队。
    红专教导团、营的政治文化学习与生产结合得很紧密，他们白天劳动，晚上学习，一边劳动，一边学习。学习方法主要是上课和鸣放辩论相结合，随时进行社会主义和共产主义教育。
    先锋公社教导营在学习中还设置对立面，开展表扬、批评和自我批评。如学员张根松工作中挑肥拣瘦，强调困难。营领导上一面表扬了劳动积极、革命干劲很大的学员洪光海、熊美英，树立旗帜，一面组织大家辩论“青年们对待社会主义和共产主义应抱什么态度？像张根松这样的劳动态度能不能建成社会主义？”经过辩论，大家都受到了教育，张根松也有很大的转变，他在帮助庙下大队抢收晚稻时，就首先跳入半人深的烂冬田抢割。
    教导团、营还积极培养青年成为多面手。先锋公社教导营现在已有一批战士学会小麦鳞背式播种法，有四十个学员学会一般炼铁技术，其中十个已成为炼铁技术员。他们还计划用自己的双手建筑营房，修造马路。杭州郊区教导团学员黄小狗和鲁春根经过三番五次的试验和钻研，创造出独人推动绞盘的经验，使绳索牵引机的效率大大提高。
    教导团、营在劳动的同时，还利用上下工时间和生产间隙进行军事训练。杭州郊区教导团战士经过半个月勤学苦练，不但学会了队列、实弹射击，而且克服了自由散漫习惯，加强了组织性、纪律性，做到一切行动服从命令听指挥。
    参加教导团、营劳动和学习的社员回去后都成为公社和大队、生产队的骨干力量。
    现在，杭州郊区和先锋公社正在总结如何办教导团、营的经验，准备在公社、生产队普遍建立教导营、连。
