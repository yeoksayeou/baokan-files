    Spark, The American Lackey

    The Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Spark, has once again been singing the tune of strengthening "cooperation" and "consultation" among the member states of this bloc at the Paris Conference. This is not the first time Spark has sung this tune, nor will it be the last. He always sings it whenever the American ruling clique needs him to.

    One can almost always hear Spark's voice, and this voice always coincides with Dulles' tune like a perfect match. When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was falling apart and Dulles was clamoring for "interdependence" to "replace independence," he desperately demanded that certain countries abandon nationalism and submit to "supranational control." When Dulles attempted to strengthen control over Western Europe, he published an article in the American "Foreign Affairs" loudly exclaiming: "Western Europe cannot solve its own problems, American leadership is essential. Without America, Europe cannot exist. This fact needs no further proof." When Dulles plotted to build American missile bases in Western Europe, he repeatedly claimed that rejecting atomic weapons was foolish! When the people of European countries demanded that American troops get out, he frightened people by saying: "The withdrawal of American troops from Europe would have fatal consequences..."

    Over the years, this Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who has almost always followed the diplomatic steps of the United States, has been aptly called "America's Housekeeper in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," Mr. Spark.

    Spark was born into a large bourgeois family in Brussels, Belgium. While studying law at the University of Brussels, Spark began his political speculation and joined the Socialist Party. After graduation, he appeared as a "left-wing" member of the Socialist Party, but during the Belgian coal miners' strike in 1935, Spark's mask was torn off. He vehemently supported the reactionary policies of the Van Zeeland cabinet towards the strike and the proposition of "eliminating class struggle in Belgium." The political speculator Spark thus successively served as Minister of Transport, Post and Telegraph, and Foreign Minister in the Van Zeeland cabinet from 1935 to 1936. In 1938, he also served as Prime Minister. In September 1939, he once again served as Foreign Minister. Truly, he was rising rapidly in the world.

    In the days when the shadow of World War II loomed, Spark's attitude was pro-German. After Hitler's iron heel trampled on Belgium, Spark sold himself to the Nazis. He did not gain the favor of the occupiers, but it didn't matter. Spark's opportunity to serve the fascists did not disappear. Because Spark had made the merit of promoting Belgium's first recognition of the Franco regime among European countries, Franco took Spark in. It is worth noting that Himmler, the head of German intelligence, was also in Spain at that time.

    After the end of World War II, Spark returned to Belgium uneasily, worrying day and night that people would investigate his relationship with German fascism. However, the result was a false alarm. Spark not only got away with impunity but actually had good luck. The Belgian socialists, who were trembling with fear at the booming workers' movement, welcomed Spark and brought him out to serve as the vanguard against the workers' movement. Thus, in February 1945, Spark served as Foreign Minister in the Socialist Van Acker cabinet, and later ascended to the throne of Prime Minister. In 1946, he was also elected as the Chairman of the First United Nations General Assembly.

    Spark would not be satisfied with this position. He found new masters in Washington and Wall Street. As a large capitalist in Belgium and a major shareholder in the "National Arms Factory" and the "Dill Car Factory," Spark had connections with the American monopoly capital group. With this connection, he acted as an agent for the United States. He actively supported and participated in the activities of the United States in piecing together various aggressive organizations in Western Europe, such as the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, and the conclusion of the Paris Treaty. From 1949, Spark successively served as the Chairman of the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the Council of Europe and the Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly of the Council, and the European Federal Movement. From 1952, he served as Chairman of the European Coal and Steel Community. From April 1954, he served as Foreign Minister again until April 1957, when he was appointed Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Climbing so fast and so high, Spark seemed to regard himself as an "international statesman."

    Someone once asked Spark a question that was most pleasing to Spark's heart: when in his life did he reach the pinnacle of his career? He shrugged his shoulders and replied: "That moment has not yet arrived." Indeed, Spark's current situation is no longer comparable to when he despised "little Belgium." He has been linked to the "Atlantic cause" and the fate of the masters on the other side of the Atlantic.

    美国的狗腿子斯巴克
    北大西洋集团的秘书长斯巴克，在巴黎会议上又高唱起什么这个集团成员国之间加强“合作”和“协商”的调子来了。这不是斯巴克第一次唱这种调子，也不是最后一次，每当美国统治集团需要的时候他总会这样唱的。
    人们几乎可以经常听到斯巴克的声音，而这个声音总是同杜勒斯的调子如合符节。当北大西洋公约组织分崩离析，杜勒斯大嚷大叫要“相互依赖”来“取代独立”的时候，他就竭力要求某些国家放弃民族主义、服从“超民族控制”。当杜勒斯企图加强对西欧的控制的时候，他就在美国“外交季刊”上发表文章大声疾呼：“西欧不能解决自己的问题，美国的领导是必不可少的。没有美国，欧洲就不能存在。这个事实是不需要进一步证明的。”当杜勒斯策划在西欧建立美国导弹基地时，他连声称诺：拒绝原子武装是愚蠢的！当欧洲各国人民要求美国军队滚出去的时候，他吓唬人说：“美国军队撤出欧洲会产生致命的后果……”。
    这几年来，几乎是一步一趋地遵循着美国的外交步调的这位北大西洋集团的秘书长，已被人们恰切地称为“美国在北大西洋集团的管家”斯巴克先生。
    斯巴克出身于比利时布鲁塞尔的一个大资产阶级的家庭。斯巴克在布鲁塞尔大学法律系读书的时候，就开始了政治投机，参加了社会党。毕业以后，他曾以社会党“左派”的面貌出现，但在1935年比利时煤矿工人大罢工斗争中，斯巴克的假面具就撕破了，他竭力拥护樊齐兰内阁对待罢工的反动政策和“消灭比利时阶级斗争”的主张。政治投机家斯巴克也就因而在1935年—1936年先后担任樊齐兰内阁的运输邮电大臣、外交大臣。1938年还出任首相。1939年9月再度出任外交大臣。真所谓飞黄腾达了。
    在第二次世界大战阴影笼罩的日子里，斯巴克的态度是亲德的。希特勒的铁蹄践踏比利时后，斯巴克就向纳粹卖身投靠，他没有得到占领者的青睐，不过，不要紧，斯巴克替法西斯效劳的机会并没有消失，由于斯巴克立过促成比利时在欧洲国家首先认识弗朗哥政权的功劳，弗朗哥收留了斯巴克。值得注意的是，那时德国特务首脑希姆莱，也正在西班牙哩。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，斯巴克惴惴不安地回到比利时，日夜担心人们要清查他与德国法西斯的关系。但是，结果却是一场虚惊。斯巴克不仅得以逍遥法外，而且居然还走了红运。正被蓬勃发展的工人运动吓得发抖的比利时社会党人，欢迎了斯巴克，把他抬出来，充当反对工人运动的急先锋。于是1945年2月，斯巴克出任社会党范阿克内阁的外交大臣，后来又登上了总理的宝座。1946年还被选为第一届联合国大会主席。
    斯巴克是不会满足于这一地位的，他从华盛顿和华尔街那里找着了新的主子。作为比利时的大资本家、“全国军火制造厂”和“迪尔汽车工厂”的大股东，斯巴克同美国垄断资本集团本来就有联系。凭着这一姻缘，他充当了美国的代理人。他积极支持和参加了美国在西欧拼凑各种侵略组织的活动，如建立北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟，缔结巴黎条约等。从1949年起，斯巴克先后担任了联合国大会政治与安全委员会、欧洲委员会和该委员会的部长会议及咨询议会、欧洲联邦运动的主席。1952年起任欧洲煤钢联营主席。1954年4月起再任外交大臣，直至1957年4月改任北大西洋公约组织秘书长。爬得这么快，这么高，斯巴克俨然以“国际政治家”自居了。
    曾有人向斯巴克提一个最合斯巴克的心意的问题：在他一生中什么时候才算达到了宦途的顶点？他耸耸肩膀回答说：“这样的时刻还没有到来。”的确，斯巴克现在的境遇，已经不是他鄙视“小小的比利时”的时候所可比拟的了，他已经同“大西洋的事业”、同大西洋彼岸的主子的命运联系在一起了。
