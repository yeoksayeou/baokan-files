Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th: The famous Soviet spaceflight expert Pobedonostsev said that the mission to fly to the moon is now technically feasible for the Soviet Union.

He also pointed out that the ideal time to launch a rocket to the moon is during the new moon phase. Because at this time, the moon is between the Earth and the Sun. In this way, the Sun's gravity can give the spacecraft flying to the moon additional speed.

In an article published in the "Moscow Truth" on the 5th, Pobedonostsev said that in order for a rocket to overcome Earth's gravity and fly into space, the rocket's speed must reach more than 11 kilometers per second, and it will take about five days and nights to reach the moon. If the rocket spacecraft's speed reaches 11.2 kilometers per second, it will only take 51 hours to reach the moon.

When talking about the steps to fly to the moon, he said that before people reach the moon, reconnaissance flights should first be made around the moon. In this flight, various automatic instruments and photography will be used to obtain the most accurate materials about the moon's atmosphere, surface structure, temperature, and magnetic field. After the spacecraft goes around the back of the moon, it should return to Earth. The second step will be to release an unmanned, automatically controlled rocket, which will land on the moon. After scientists have studied all the characteristics of these two flights, the first batch of "heroes and warriors" will set off to fly to the moon. He said that it would only take about 150 days and nights to fly to Mars. But for this, the rocket's speed must reach 12 kilometers per second. This is also achievable.

### 月宫可攀  苏联已解决飞往月球的技术问题

    苏联已解决飞往月球的技术问题
    新华社莫斯科7日电  苏联著名宇宙飞行专家波别多诺斯切夫说，飞往月球的任务目前苏联在技术上已经能办到。
    他还指出，向月球发射火箭最理想的时间是在新月时期。因为月球这时正处在地球和太阳之间。这样太阳引力可以使飞向月球的宇宙飞船获得额外的速度。
    波别多诺斯切夫5日在“莫斯科真理报”上发表的文章中说，要使火箭克服地球引力飞入宇宙，必须使火箭速度达到每秒十一公里以上，这时约五昼夜可达月球。如果火箭飞船每秒速度达十一·二公里，只要五十一小时就能到达月球。
    他在谈到飞往月球的步骤时说，在人到达月球前，首先要在月球周围作侦察性的飞行。在这一飞行中将利用各种自动仪器和摄影来获得最精确的有关月球的大气、表面结构、温度和磁场材料。宇宙飞船在绕过月球背后以后应回到地球上。第二步将放出一个无人的自动操纵的火箭。它将在月球上着陆。当科学家们研究了这两次飞行的所有特点后，第一批“英雄和勇士”就将出发飞往月球。他说，飞向火星只要约一百五十昼夜。但为此火箭飞行速度必须达每秒十二公里。这一点也是可以做到的。
