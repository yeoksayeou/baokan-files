We are pleased to see that both sides have reached complete agreement on all the issues discussed. Based on the results of the talks, the two governments have issued a joint statement today. We believe that the visit of the Korean government delegation to our country and the talks held between the leaders of the two governments will not only be conducive to further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, but will also make a significant contribution to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the cause of world peace."

    Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying: "The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Korean people on the great achievements they have made under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il Sung, and firmly support the Korean people's cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.
