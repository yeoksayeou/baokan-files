    Relatives of the Mother
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Guoning
    Early winter, the cold is somewhat biting. Zhao Yumei, carrying her midwifery kit, hurried along the Jinghui Canal. Sometimes the heavy rain soaked her clothes, but she still trudged along the muddy road. A peasant woman named Yu Xiuyun, hearing that Yumei had arrived in their commune, quickly ran to the production team headquarters to call her to her home, asking her to change her wet clothes and have a meal. She picked up her nine-month-old son, teasing him, "Call her auntie, it was this dear auntie who saved your life!" As she spoke, tears of excitement and gratitude glistened in Xiuyun's eyes.
    In the past, Yu Xiuyun had given birth to two children, but the infants were "stillborn" after birth. Because the old midwives didn't know how to save "stillborn" babies, Yu Xiuyun had to watch her children being buried wrapped in reed mats, tears in her eyes. Last June, she became pregnant again. She and her husband, Yang Jinming, were both worried, afraid that the infant would die again after birth. Zhao Yumei, knowing about this, came to give her prenatal check-ups and advised her to go to the rural maternity hospital for delivery. This March, Yu Xiuyun came to the maternity hospital with a glimmer of hope. After the child was born, it didn't cry or move, appearing "stillborn" again. Zhao Yumei and others tried everything to perform artificial respiration resuscitation on the infant, finally saving its life. Now this nine-month-old baby is growing up fair and plump. To commemorate and thank the maternity hospital, the parents named the child "Yuansheng" (Hospital-born).
    Yumei is the director of the community-run maternity hospital in Dongfanghong People's Commune, Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province. This maternity hospital was jointly established by the former "Heping" and "Gangtie" agricultural cooperatives in October 1956 and is one of the earliest community-run maternity hospitals in Shaanxi Province. At that time, besides Feng Zhuqing, who was an old midwife, Zhao Yumei, Yin Yuxia, and Wang Shufang were all young people in their teens and twenties. Zhao Yumei was the youngest, only sixteen years old, a graduate of higher primary school, and people called her "Little Director." At that time, the surrounding masses didn't quite trust them. Women, seeing they were young girls, smiled and said, "You haven't even gotten married yourselves, how can you deliver babies for others!" Some pregnant women, seeing them coming with their midwifery kits, would run away from afar. Once, Yumei heard that Wang Yaru of Tongguan Zhang Village was about to give birth, so she went in the rain to give her a prenatal check-up. But Wang Yaru said disdainfully, "For generations, old midwives have delivered babies, whether they live or die is fate, what's there to check!" As Yumei was trying to persuade her, the pregnant woman's husband returned and said bluntly, "Do you want money? I'll give you some, but I don't believe in new methods of childbirth!" Zhao Yumei, full of enthusiasm, was splashed with cold water and almost burst into tears. Her partners also encountered similar rebuffs. Some midwives wanted to go home and quit. Some of Yumei's former classmates also satirized her, saying, "Oh! You've become a midwife, tsk tsk..." Yumei thought to herself: I'm not worried about food or clothing, yet I'm constantly dealing with poop and diapers, serving pregnant women, having to get up at the crack of dawn and sleep late at night, my eyes are bloodshot, and my back aches.... Suffering is nothing, but I can't stand those sarcastic remarks. Thinking of this, she once felt so uncomfortable that she cried under her covers. This matter reached Lu Hefu, the Party Secretary of Sanqu Township, who warmly said to her, "This is the difficulty, a Communist Youth League member retreating in the face of such a small difficulty, how can that be! In the beginning, overcoming the difficulty will make things easier. You must know that a mother is two lives, why would the Party entrust such an important task to you, think about it carefully." Yumei's heart suddenly brightened, she tossed and turned in bed unable to sleep, put on her clothes and read "The Biography of Liu Hulan" again, she asked herself, "Right, right, getting discouraged at the slightest difficulty, what kind of Communist Youth League member is that, what thing can be done without difficulties?"
    Yumei made up her mind, and then united and helped her partners, and everyone patiently explained and promoted to the pregnant women, and the work gradually started. More and more people accepted prenatal examinations and hospitalization. They also tried everything to deliver babies at home. One night last spring, a pregnant woman in Xiliu Village was about to give birth. Zhao Yumei, hearing this, immediately braved the heavy snow to go to the pregnant woman's home. The people in the pregnant woman's family, seeing her lips were purple from the cold and she was shivering all over, quickly pulled her onto the warm kang to warm up, and repeatedly said to Yumei, "Thank goodness you came, otherwise who would go through this hardship to take care of this matter!" In winter, Yumei and Yin Yuxia, Wang Shufang, and others' hands, because they often soaked in water washing diapers, were chapped and cracked, but the delivery room was warm, with hot food and delicious dishes, whatever the pregnant women wanted to eat, they would make it. Every day, Zhao Yumei and others would hold babies to feed them milk, wash tableware and bottles, and carefully fill out the pregnant women's temperature, pulse rate, and bowel movement information, the doors, windows, and tables were swept and dusted spotlessly. The pregnant women, seeing this situation, said with emotion, you can't be iron men, you must value your own bodies! Yumei smiled and said, it doesn't matter, as long as the mother and child are safe, that is our greatest satisfaction!
    Zhao Yumei and her partners not only have a diligent and conscientious work spirit, but also strive to study technology. Once, Zhao Yumei saw that some pregnant women's vulvas ruptured during childbirth, which was very painful. She carefully observed and studied this issue. Even while eating, her eyes were still fixed on the "Obstetrics" book spread out on the edge of the kang. Finally, she understood that the vulva rupture was mainly caused by artificial labor induction being too hasty. When pregnant woman Wu Huilan was giving birth to her first child, she was afraid of difficult labor and asked Yumei to deliver the baby. Yumei carefully guided the pregnant woman, and the fetus was born very naturally. Since then, none of the pregnant women they delivered had vulva rupture. Pregnant women Li Airong and Yang Yulian had premature births, and after their careful care, two babies weighing only three jin each also survived.
    They are always concerned about the comfort of the pregnant women in their work. When Yin Yuxia saw that the pregnant women were not satisfied with the delivery bed, they worked together to improve it and created a "native delivery bed." This native delivery bed is made of bricks and adobe, with a wooden frame with handrails for the pregnant woman at the head of the bed, and a footrest on each side, so that the pregnant woman can freely move to a place suitable for her figure. When the weather is cold, fire can be burned under the delivery bed to heat it, which is very popular with pregnant women.
    Zhao Yumei and her three partners often braved the scorching heat and severe cold to travel to more than 40 villages along the Jinghui Canal. In the past two years, more than 320 babies have been born through their hands, and they have gone out to give prenatal examinations to more than 900 pregnant women. The mothers and children who were delivered by them were all safe, and none of them suffered from postpartum rheumatism or puerperal fever. In their work, they have met many relatives like Yu Xiuyun. Many mothers, in order to permanently thank the maternity hospital, named their children "Yuanping," "Yuan'an," "Hongyuan," etc. Now, the adoption of new methods of childbirth by pregnant women in this area has increased from 27% two years ago to more than 95%. Zhao Yumei and the maternity hospital she leads were commended and rewarded by the Ministry of Health in August this year. Zhao Yumei and her partners have been selected as advanced collectives to participate in this national conference of active women in socialist construction. (Attached picture)

    产妇的亲人
    本报记者  张国宁
    初冬，寒气有些逼人。赵玉梅背着接生箱，风尘仆仆地在泾惠渠沿岸奔波。有时大雨打湿了她的衣衫，但她仍在泥泞的道路上跋涉。一个名叫余秀云的农妇，听说玉梅到了她们社里，赶紧跑到生产队队部，把她叫到自己家里，要她换湿衣服，让她吃饭。她抱起自己九个多月的男孩子，逗趣地说：“叫姨姨，就是这位亲姨姨救了你的命呀！”说话时，秀云的眼眶里闪着兴奋、感激的泪花。
    过去，余秀云曾生过两个小孩，但婴孩出生后都是“假死”。由于旧接生婆不懂得怎样挽救“假死”的婴儿，余秀云不得不噙着眼泪，看着自己的孩子被苇席卷着埋掉。去年6月，她又怀孕了。她和她的丈夫杨金明都满脸愁容，害怕婴孩生下后又会死去。赵玉梅知道了这事后，就来为她作产前检查，并劝她分娩时到农村产院来。今年3月，余秀云抱着一线希望来到了产院。孩子生下后，又是一声不哭，一动不动，呈现“假死”状态。赵玉梅等想尽办法为婴儿施行人工呼吸急救法，终于保住了婴儿的生命。现在这个九个月的婴儿长得又白又胖。为了纪念和感谢产院，爹爹妈妈为孩子起名叫“院生”。
    玉梅是陕西泾阳县东方红人民公社民办产院的院长。这个产院是原来的“和平”和“钢铁”两个农业社在1956年10月联合建立的，是陕西省最早的一所民办产院。当时产院里除冯竹青是旧接生婆外，赵玉梅、殷玉霞、王淑芳都是十几岁至二十岁的年轻人。赵玉梅最小，仅十六岁，是个高小毕业生，人们都称她为“小院长”。当时，周围群众对她们是不大信任的。妇女见她们是个小姑娘，笑着说：“自己都没结婚，还能给旁人接娃！”有些孕妇看见她们背着接生箱来了，老远就躲开。有一次，玉梅听说同官张村王亚茹快要分娩，就冒着雨去作产前检查。但王亚茹却轻蔑地说：几辈子都是老接生婆接的娃，该死该活，那是天命呀，有什么可检查的！玉梅正在劝说的时候，产妇的丈夫回来了，劈头说道：“想要钱么，给你几个都行，我就是不信新法接生！”满腔热情的赵玉梅被泼了一瓢冷水，委屈得几乎掉下眼泪。她的几个伙伴也碰到同样的钉子。有些接生员想回家不干了。玉梅过去的同学，有些也讽刺她说：“哟！你成了接生婆了，啧啧啧……”玉梅心里想：自己又不愁吃不少穿，成天在屎布尿布里搅，侍候产妇，还得起鸡啼睡半夜的，眼睛都熬红了，腰也酸了……。吃苦倒也没啥，可就是受不了那些风凉话。想到这里，他曾难受得蒙着被子哭了起来。这事情，传到三渠乡乡党委书记吕合福那里，吕合福就热诚地向她说：“这就是困难，共青团员碰到这么一点困难就退缩，那还成呀！刚开始么，冲过困难就好办了。你们要知道，一个产妇就是两个生命，党为什么会把这样重要的任务交给你们，好好想一想。”玉梅的心里豁然亮了，她睡在床上翻来复去睡不着，披上衣服又一次来读“刘胡兰小传”，她抚心自问：“对，对，碰见手指头大的一点困难就泄气，那还叫啥共青团员，做啥事情能没有困难呢？”
    玉梅自己下了决心，就团结和帮助自己的伙伴，大家耐心地向孕妇宣传解释，工作才逐渐开展起来。接受产前检查和住院的人也越来越多。她们还想尽一切办法上门接生。去年春天的一个深夜，西刘村有个产妇将要分娩，赵玉梅听到后，立即冒着鹅毛大雪到了产妇家里。产妇家里的人，看到她冻得嘴唇发紫，浑身直打寒噤，连忙把她拉到热炕上取暖，并连连向玉梅说：“多亏你来了，不然谁会吃这个苦头来管这事呢！”冬天，玉梅和殷玉霞、王淑芳等几个人的手，因为常常在水里浸洗屎布而冻得生了裂口，而产房却是暖烘烘的，热饭香菜，产妇要吃什么，就作什么。每天，赵玉梅等人一会儿抱婴孩喂奶，一会儿又洗餐具，奶瓶，并认真地填写产妇体温、脉搏跳动次数和大小便情况，门窗和桌凳扫拂得一尘不染。产妇们看到这种情况，感动地说，你们该不是铁人，也要看重自己的身体呀！玉梅微笑着说，不打紧，只要母子安全，就是我们最大的欣慰！
    赵玉梅她们不但有勤勤恳恳的工作精神，而且还努力钻研技术。有一次，赵玉梅看到有些产妇在分娩时阴户破裂，非常痛苦。她就仔细留心观察和研究这个问题。就是在吃饭时，眼睛还盯着摊在炕边的“助产学”。终于了解到阴户所以破裂，主要是因为人工催生过急所致。产妇吴惠兰生头一胎，害怕难产，叫玉梅接生，她就细心指导孕妇，胎儿很自然地生了下来。从此以后，她们所接生的产妇，再没有发生过阴户破裂的现象。产妇李爱荣、杨玉莲早产，经过她们细心护理，两个体重只有三斤的婴儿也成活了。
    她们在工作中处处关心产妇的舒适，殷玉霞看到产妇对产床感到不太满意时，她们就共同研究改进，创造了一种“土产床”。这种土产床是用砖和土坯砌成的，床头装有产妇扶手的木架，左右两边各有一个脚蹬，产妇可以自由挪动到适合自己身材的地方。天气冷了，产床下面还可以烧火加温，很受产妇欢迎。
    赵玉梅和她的三个伙伴，常常冒着酷暑严寒，奔走于泾惠渠沿岸的四十多个村庄。两年来，有三百二十多个婴儿经她们的手降生，并外出为九百多个孕妇作了产前检查。经她们接生的婴儿，母子都很平安，没有一个得四六风或产褥热的。在工作中，她们结识了许许多多像余秀云那样的亲人。许多母亲为了永久感谢产院，给自己的孩子起名叫“院平”、“院安”、“红院”等。现在这一带孕妇采用新法接生的，已由两年前的27％增加到95％以上。赵玉梅和她领导的产院，今年8月受到了中央卫生部的表扬和奖励。赵玉梅和她的伙伴们，已被选为参加这次全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的先进集体。（附图片）
