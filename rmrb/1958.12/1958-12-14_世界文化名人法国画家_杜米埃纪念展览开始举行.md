Xinhua News Agency, December 13th. The exhibition commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of French painter Honoré Victor Daumier, a World Cultural Celebrity in 1958, opened at the Art Exhibition Hall in Shuaifuyuan, Beijing, on the 13th. The exhibition is jointly sponsored and organized by the China Peace Committee, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Artists Association.

Daumier (1808-1879) was an outstanding French artist and an active democratic fighter. With his sharp brush and satirical drawings, he vividly portrayed the greedy, cunning, selfish, corrupt, and cruel nature of the reactionary ruling class, severely hitting the reactionary rulers of the time. He also enthusiastically praised the resolute fighting will of the revolutionary masses. He linked his lifelong artistic activities with the democratic revolution and always stood with the broad masses fighting for freedom and democracy in France.

The exhibition features more than 170 reproductions of Daumier's oil paintings, satirical drawings, and watercolors. On the 13th, the persons in charge of the various sponsoring units and people from the art world attended the exhibition.

    世界文化名人法国画家
    杜米埃纪念展览开始举行
    新华社13日讯  1958年世界文化名人法国画家奥诺莱·维克多·杜米埃诞生一百五十年纪念展览会，13日在北京帅府园美术展览馆开始展出。这个展览会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国美术家协会联合举办的。
    杜米埃（1808—1879）是法国的一位杰出的艺术家，也是一位积极的民主战士。他用锋锐的画笔和讽刺画的形式，淋漓尽致地刻划了反动统治阶级的贪婪、狡诈、自私、腐败和残酷的本质，狠狠地打击了当时的反动统治者；也热情地歌颂了革命群众的坚决斗争意志。他把自己一生的艺术活动和民主革命联系起来，始终和争取法兰西的由自和民主的广大群众站在一起。
    展览会展出了杜米埃的油画、讽刺画、水彩画的复制品一百七十余件。13日有各主办单位的负责人和美术界人士到会参观了展览。
