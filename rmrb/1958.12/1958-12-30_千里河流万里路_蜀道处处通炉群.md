Sichuan Province Builds More Than 10,000 Kilometers of New Roads
Two Million Vehicles and 50,000 Tons of Ships Built

Chengdu Dispatch, December 29th. While focusing on steel transportation, Sichuan Province has also tightly grasped the construction of water and land transportation. This year, the province has built over 10,000 kilometers of new roads, opened up and improved 1,200 kilometers of waterways, newly built over two million vehicles of various types, and newly built 50,000 tons of wooden boats, alleviating the contradiction between the ever-increasing transportation volume and transport capacity.

Many places have adopted indigenous methods to improve small rivers, tapping into the potential of water transport. The Xiao'anxi River in Tongliang County flows through five mining areas in the county, but due to shallow water and many shoals, the transportation volume was very small. The Tongliang County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized local stonemasons and earthworkers to dismantle bricks and stones from abandoned bunkers and bridge foundations, using lime instead of cement. After a month of hard work, they built two sluice gates, raising the water level by more than one meter, doubling the wooden boat transportation capacity, and solving the transportation problems of the five mining areas along the river. The Longhua Iron Plant in Changning County transformed a small creek of more than 2,000 meters long into a large river, allowing wooden boats with a load of 20 tons to pass smoothly. This newly opened "canal" connects the highway above and the big river below. Originally, 3,000 people in this iron plant were responsible for transportation, but now only 300 people are needed.

Various places have also used indigenous methods to open mountains and split ridges, allowing "roads to reach furnace groups and cars to climb mountain peaks," greatly changing the transportation landscape of mountainous areas. In order to solve the transportation problems of the three key iron-producing counties of Gulin, Gusong, and Xuyong, which are located in the overlapping mountains, the Luzhou Special District recently organized a transportation construction army of more than 75,000 people to build roads in the high mountains. The 39 roads in the three counties, totaling 696 kilometers in length, will all be completed by the end of this year or early next year.

While harnessing rivers and building roads, all localities have attached great importance to the work of converting ferries into bridges. In the past, once transportation was strained, it would take half a day or a day to cross a ferry. For example, the Yanju Ferry in Jiangzhang County, which spans the main stream of the Fujiang River, is the only way for the entire mining area to reach the blast furnace groups and the railway station. During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, the ferry was crowded day and night with people and horses shouting. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, the Jiangzhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses, used local materials, and used bamboo cages, pebbles, and wooden piles to build a 120-meter-long temporary car bridge in eight days, so that vehicles and horses could pass smoothly from then on.

Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that Party committees at all levels should comprehensively grasp transportation work, grasping both transportation work and transportation construction. In transportation work, it is necessary to grasp both trunk line long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to push transportation and transportation construction to a new climax.

    千里河流万里路  蜀道处处通炉群
    四川省新建公路一万多公里
    造车二百万部造船五万吨位
    本报成都29日电  四川省在抓钢铁运输的同时，紧紧抓住了水陆交通的建设工作。今年内，全省新建公路已达一万余公里，开辟和整治航道一千二百公里，新造各种车辆二百余万部，新造木船五万吨位，缓和了日益增长的运量和运力之间的矛盾。
    许多地方采取用土办法整治小河，挖掘了水运潜力。铜梁县境内的小安溪，流经全县五个矿区，但由于水浅滩多，运量很小。中共铜梁县委把当地的石工、土工组织起来，从废弃的碉堡、桥基上拆下砖、石，用石灰代替水泥，苦战一月，建成了两座水闸，提高水位一公尺多，木船运量翻两番，解决了沿河五个矿区的运输问题。长宁县龙华铁厂把一条二千多公尺长的小溪变成了大河，载重二十吨的木船可以畅通无阻。这条新开的“运河”，上接公路，下连大江，原来这个铁厂有三千人担负运输工作，现在只需要三百人。
    各地还用土办法开山劈岭，让“公路通炉群，汽车上山岗”，大大改变了山区的交通面貌。泸州专区为了突击解决大山重叠的古蔺、古宋、叙永三个产铁重点县的交通运输问题，最近组织了七万五千多人的交通建设大军，在崇山峻岭间修筑公路。三个县共长六百九十六公里的三十九条公路，将在今年底或明年初全部完成。
    在治河修路的同时，各地十分重视渡口桥梁化的工作。过去运输一紧张，过一次渡耽误半天、一天。比如江彰县岩咀渡，横跨涪江干流，是全个矿区通往高炉群和火车站的必经之地。在大炼钢铁运动中，渡口上日夜人喊马嘶，拥挤得很。中共江彰县委为了消灭这一现象，动员群众，就地取材，采用竹笼、卵石、木桩，八天内就建成了一座一百二十公尺长的汽车便桥，从此车马畅通无阻。
    最近，中共四川省委提出各级党委要把交通运输工作全面抓起来，既要抓运输工作，也要抓交通建设。在运输工作中既要抓干线长途运输，也要抓短途运输。要充分发动群众，把运输与交通建设推向新高潮。
