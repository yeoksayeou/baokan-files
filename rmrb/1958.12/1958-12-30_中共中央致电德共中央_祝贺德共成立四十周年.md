    CPC Central Committee Sends Telegram to Central Committee of German Communist Party 
    Congratulates on the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the German Communist Party

    The 30th of December marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the German Communist Party to express congratulations. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

    To the Central Committee of the German Communist Party:

    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party, the CPC Central Committee, on behalf of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extends warm fraternal greetings to the German Communist Party and all the working people of Germany.

    The glorious German Communist Party was born and grew in the revolutionary flames of the Great October Revolution, adhering to the truth of Marxism, and opposing opportunism, chauvinism, and imperialist war. During the Hitler fascist rule and the Second World War, the German Communist Party underwent a glorious test and paid a significant price. After Western imperialism forced Germany into division, the German Communist Party resolutely exposed the West German monopoly capitalist group's conspiracy to revive fascist militarism in collusion with U.S. imperialism. The German Communist Party has unswervingly struggled for peace, democracy, safeguarding the vital interests of the working people, and restoring the reunification of Germany. In its heroic struggle, it has suffered unreasonable bans and illegal persecution by the reactionary rule. History has proven that although the German reactionary regime has repeatedly used various absurd and shameless excuses to ban the German Communist Party, the result is that the rulers have neither been able to destroy the German communist movement nor have they been able to save themselves from destruction. History has also proven that communists are the true defenders of the interests of the motherland and the people, while the fascist reactionaries have endangered the legitimate national interests of Germany.

    Today, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger, the socialist German Democratic Republic is being consolidated and developed day by day, the forces of peace in the world are greater than the forces of war, and the forces of progress are greater than the forces of reaction. Today, the just struggle of the German Communist Party is by no means isolated. It is receiving the concern and support of the working class and peace-loving people of all countries in the world. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are following the heroic and unyielding struggle of the German Communist Party in difficult circumstances with great respect and concern, and sincerely congratulate the German Communist Party on its greater achievements in the struggle for democracy and the protection of the interests of the working class, for the restoration of German unity, against militarism, for the defense of European and world peace, in the struggle against modern revisionism and for strengthening the unity of the international communist movement, and deeply believe that your just struggle will surely achieve final victory!

                                        The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                              December 29, 1958

    中共中央致电德共中央 
    祝贺德共成立四十周年
    新华社29日讯  12月30日是德国共产党成立四十周年纪念日。中国共产党中央委员会特电德国共产党中央委员会祝贺。贺电全文如下：德国共产党中央委员会：
    欣逢德国共产党成立四十周年纪念日，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党和中国人民向德国共产党和全德国的劳动人民致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    光荣的德国共产党是在伟大的十月革命的影响下，坚持马克思主义真理，在反对机会主义、沙文主义和反对帝国主义战争的革命火焰中诞生和壮大起来的。在希特勒法西斯统治和第二次世界大战期间，德国共产党经受了光荣的考验，付出了重大的牺牲。在西方帝国主义强迫德国陷入分裂以后，德国共产党坚决揭露同美帝国主义勾结的西德垄断资本集团复活法西斯军国主义的阴谋。德国共产党坚持不渝地为争取和平、民主、保卫劳动人民的切身利益和恢复德国的重新统一而斗争。在英勇斗争中，它遭受了反动统治的无理取缔和非法迫害。历史证明了，德国反动政权虽曾一再用种种荒谬无耻的借口禁止德国共产党，但结果是统治者既没有能够摧毁德国的共产主义运动，也没有可能挽救自己的灭亡。历史也证明了，共产主义者是祖国利益和人民利益的真正保卫者，而法西斯反动派才使德国的正当的民族利益遭受危害。
    今天，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经更加壮大，社会主义的德意志民主共和国正在日益巩固发展，世界的和平力量大于战争力量，进步力量大于反动力量，今天德国共产党的正义斗争绝不是孤立的，它受到世界各国工人阶级和爱好和平人民的关怀和支持。中国共产党和中国人民以极大的尊敬和关怀注视着德国共产党在艰苦环境中所进行的英勇不屈的斗争，并衷心地祝贺德国共产党在争取民主和保卫工人阶级的利益，争取恢复德国的统一，反对军国主义，保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争中，在反对现代修正主义，加强国际共产主义运动的团结的事业中，获得更大的成就，并深信你们的正义斗争必将取得最后的胜利！
                                        中国共产党中央委员会
                                              1958年12月29日
