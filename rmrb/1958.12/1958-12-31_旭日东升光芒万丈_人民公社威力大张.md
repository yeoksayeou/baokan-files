Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Reporter Su Mu reports: Since the autumn harvest, the people's communes in China's rural areas have further demonstrated their tremendous superiority in developing industrial and agricultural production and organizing the lives of the commune members.

In October, people's communes were universally established in China's rural areas. In addition to the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions that had fully realized communization before National Day, other provinces and regions, including a number of rural people's communes in Yunnan and Xinjiang, were basically established in October. According to statistics from early November: Agricultural producers' cooperatives have become a thing of the past in China's rural areas. 99.1% of the farmers of all ethnic groups in the country, more than 126.9 million households, have formed more than 26,500 large and public people's communes, with an average of 4,756 households per commune.

Rushing the autumn harvest, vigorously developing steel production, deep plowing and planting wheat, and vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings were a series of arduous tasks of production and construction and organized life undertaken by people's communes since their establishment in various places. Now, most of these tasks have been successfully completed, rural industries are developing smoothly, and winter production activities such as water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, diversified economy, rural sideline occupations, etc., are developing on a new basis and on a larger scale.

Many people's communes in various places faced an unprecedented bumper harvest as soon as they were established, and an autumn harvest task that was much larger than in previous years. At the same time, the upsurge of the whole party and the entire people to vigorously develop steel production arrived. At this time, many newly established people's communes drew a large number of strong laborers to mine ores, build thousands of small blast furnaces, and smelt steel. Before and after, the people's communes in rural areas across the country drew a maximum of about 60 million laborers for mining, transportation, and iron smelting, which strongly supported the rise of the steel marshal. During this period, adhering to the policy of promoting both industry and agriculture, people's communes in various places also set up various industries according to local conditions. Small factories such as local fertilizer plants, local pesticide plants, farm tool manufacturing plants, building material plants, agricultural product processing plants, and comprehensive utilization factories sprung up like mushrooms in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics: There are now more than 6 million industrial units of various types run by counties and communes across the country. The most numerous are farm tool machinery and local fertilizer plants, of which farm tool machinery plants account for about one-tenth. The others are light and heavy industries such as metallurgy, coal, petroleum, building materials, textiles, rice and grain processing, daily necessities light industry, and food industry. Most industries such as metallurgy, petroleum, and building materials are emerging rural industries after communization. Moreover, the power industry in rural areas has also developed rapidly after communization. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei Province by mid-November, the province had built more than 13,000 small hydropower, thermal power, wind power, biogas power stations, and power stations, enabling many communes in the province to have power to process grain, and individual communes to have electricity for lighting. The establishment of these industries fully demonstrates the superiority of people's communes in utilizing manpower, materials, and resources to accelerate socialist industrialization.

In terms of agricultural production, especially in the autumn harvest, deep plowing, and autumn planting, the tremendous power of the people's communes was demonstrated. While vigorously developing steel production, the communes rationally arranged and organized labor, and in addition, vigorously developed collective welfare undertakings to liberate women's labor force, organized various professional armies to vigorously carry out the three autumn tasks, thereby speeding up the progress of this year's heavy autumn harvest. For example, in Heilongjiang, thanks to the good organization of the labor force, although the autumn harvest task was larger than in previous years, it was completed forty days ahead of schedule. In the movement of vigorously developing deep plowing and planting wheat, the deep plowing armies of more than 10 million people each in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces set up camps in the fields in an organized and disciplined manner, worked and lived in the fields, and carried out intense and rhythmic labor, thereby ensuring that the quality of wheat planting this year was better than in any previous year. After planting wheat, people's communes in many provinces and regions continued to deep plow the cultivated land for next year's spring sowing. By the end of December, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 800 million mu of cultivated land had been deep plowed across the country, generally to a depth of eight inches to one foot, and a small number of high-yield fields had been deep plowed to two to three feet or even more than three feet. If it were not for the people's communes liberating the vast rural women, strengthening the organization of the labor force, and improving the efficiency of the labor force, if it were not for the reform of tools, it would have been difficult to complete this year's autumn harvest on time, let alone vigorously develop steel production, deep plow cultivated land, and expand wheat planting.

Now, under the system of people's communes, winter production in rural areas is unfolding on an even larger scale than last year. Taking winter field management of wheat and rapeseed as an example, people's communes in various places generally have professional teams that are carrying out topdressing, irrigation, and eliminating third-class seedlings. In many areas of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hebei, the standard of wheat field management has reached that of garden fields. In terms of water conservancy construction, both the south and the north have launched projects. This year's water conservancy construction is not only building small-scale projects, but also some large-scale key projects have started in various provinces. The progress of the projects has also been accelerated compared with last year due to the reform of tools and construction methods. Another major feature of this year's winter production is that people's communes, adhering to the policy of promoting both self-sufficient production and commodity production, are actively developing diversified operations and organizing diversified sideline production under the leadership of the Party, especially vigorously increasing the production of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and other non-staple foods for the market. Some communes have already begun to make achievements.

While doing a good job in production, people's communes in rural areas across the country are also striving to run collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, and are determined to ensure that the lives of the commune members are better than before communization. According to statistics, there are more than 2.65 million public canteens, more than 4.75 million nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 100,000 homes for the elderly in rural communes across the country. These organizations not only liberated women who had been subjected to stoves for thousands of years, but also provided thorough care for poor farmers' children who had not received good care in the past, and enabled lonely elderly people to receive care like all commune members. In particular, many people's communes across the country have implemented "free meals" on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, which has been warmly welcomed by the majority of commune members. In addition, people's communes have also enabled culture, science, and health to develop rapidly in rural areas. While implementing the collectivization of life, people's communes have also implemented militarization of organization, combatization of action, and democratization of management. They have also universally established militia organizations within the commune organization and realized that everyone is a soldier.

The people's communes have been established for a short time, and various places lack experience in running communes. At the same time, since the establishment of the communes, they have been busy with the three autumn tasks and vigorously developing steel production, and the communes still need to further consolidate their organizations and improve their systems. There are some new problems that need to be actively solved in production, distribution, life welfare, and business management. To this end, various places are now carrying out rectification and consolidation work on rural communes in close combination with winter production and the upcoming spring production, according to the instructions of the Central Committee.

    旭日东升光芒万丈
    人民公社威力大张
    突击秋收、大炼钢铁、深耕种麦、福利事业都获得出色成就
    农村工业、冬修水利、积肥造肥、多种经济以更大规模跃进
    新华社30日讯  记者苏木报道：秋收以来，我国农村人民公社在发展工、农业生产和组织人民公社社员生活等各个方面，都进一步显示了它的巨大的优越性。
    10月份，人民公社已在我国农村中普遍建立了。除在国庆前夕已经全面实现了公社化的省、市、自治区外，其他省、区，包括云南和新疆的一批农村人民公社基本上都是在10月份内建成的。据11月初统计：农业生产合作社在我国农村已成为过去，全国各族农民的99.1％，一亿两千六百九十多万户，组成了两万六千五百多个又大又公的人民公社，平均每个公社达四千七百五十六户。
    突击秋收、大炼钢铁、深耕种麦和大办集体福利事业，就是各地人民公社建成以来，所办的一系列的生产建设和组织生活的繁重任务。现在，这些任务大部分都已经出色地完成了，农村工业正顺利地发展着；水利积肥等冬季生产活动，多种经济，农村副业等等，都正在新的基础上，以更大的规模发展着。
    各地许多人民公社一建立起来，就面临着一次空前的大丰收，一次工作量比往年大得多的秋收任务。而同时，全党全民大炼钢铁的高潮到来了。这时，很多新建成的人民公社都抽了大批的强劳动力，开采矿石，修建成千上万座的小高炉，冶炼钢铁。全国农村人民公社前后抽出采矿、运输、炼铁的劳动力，最高时数达六千万人左右，有力地支援了钢铁元帅升帐。在此期间，本着工农业并举的方针，各地人民公社还纷纷根据各地的条件举办各种工业。土化肥厂、土农药厂、农具制造厂、建筑材料厂、农产品加工厂和综合利用工厂等小工厂，像雨后春笋般地在农村兴建起来了。据不完全统计：现在全国县和公社所办的各种工业单位有六百多万个。其中最多的是农具机械、土化肥厂等，其中农具机械厂，就占十分之一左右。其他就是冶金、煤炭、石油、建筑材料、纺织、米粮加工、日用品轻工业、食品工业等轻重工业。像大部分冶金、石油、建筑材料等工业，都是公社化后农村新兴的工业。而且公社化后农村的动力工业也有迅速的发展，据河北省到11月中旬不完全的统计，这个省已办了小型水力、火力、风力、沼气电站和动力站一万三千多个，使全省农村不少公社有了动力加工粮食，个别公社还有了发电照明。这些工业的举办，充分说明了人民公社在利用人力、物力、资源，加速社会主义工业化方面的优越性。
    在农业生产方面，尤其在秋收、深耕、秋种的工作中，显示了人民公社的巨大威力。各公社在大办钢铁的同时，合理安排和组织劳动力，加上大办集体福利事业解放了妇女劳动力，组织成各种专业大军大搞三秋工作；从而使今年繁重的秋收，进度得以加快。例如黑龙江由于劳动力组织的好，秋收任务虽然比往年大，但提前四十天收割完毕。在大搞深耕种麦的运动中，河南、山东、河北三省各一千万人以上的深翻大军，有组织有纪律地在田头安营扎寨，劳动和吃住在田间，进行紧张地有节奏地劳动，从而保证了今年种麦的质量比以往任何一年为好。种麦以后，很多省区的人民公社还继续深翻了明年春播的耕地。到12月底，据不完全的统计，全国前后已深翻耕地八亿亩，一般都深翻到八寸到一尺左右，少数丰产田深翻到了二尺到三尺甚至三尺以上。如果不是人民公社解放了广大的农村妇女，加强了劳动力的组织和提高了劳动力的效率，如果不是工具改革，按时完成今年的秋收也是困难的，更不用说大炼钢铁、深翻耕地和扩大种麦了。
    现在，在人民公社的制度下，农村冬季生产又以比去年更大的规模展开了。以小麦和油菜的冬季田间管理来说，各地人民公社一般都有专业队，正在进行追肥、灌水，消灭三类苗。陕西、河南、河北许多地区麦田管理的标准已达到了园田化。兴修水利方面，南方和北方都展开了，今年的水利建设，不仅兴修小型工程，而且各省都有些较大的重点工程开工，工程进度由于工具和施工方法的改革也比去年加快。今年冬季生产还有个最大的特点，那就是人民公社本着自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，正在党的领导下积极开展多种经营和组织多种的副业生产，特别是大力增产供应市场的菜蔬、肉、鱼、蛋和其他副食品。有些公社已经开始作出成绩。
    全国农村人民公社在搞好生产同时，还在努力办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业，决心保证社员的生活比公社化前过得更好。据统计，全国农村公社办起的公共食堂有二百六十五万多个，托儿所、幼儿园四百七十五万多个，敬老院十万多个。这些组织不只是解放了几千年来屈伏在锅灶旁边的妇女，而且使过去得不到良好照顾的贫苦农家儿童得到了周到的照顾，使孤寡老人和所有社员一样获得了照顾。特别是全国有很多人民公社，在今年大丰收的基础上，还实行了“吃饭不要钱”，得到广大社员的热烈欢迎。此外，人民公社还使文化、科学、卫生等在农村获得了飞快的发展。人民公社在实行生活集体化的同时，还实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、管理民主化；还在公社组织内普遍建立了民兵组织，实现了全民皆兵。
    人民公社成立的时间还短，各地办公社还缺乏经验，同时由于公社成立以来一直忙于三秋工作和大炼钢铁等工作，公社还有待于进一步巩固组织和健全制度，在生产、分配、生活福利、经营管理等方面都有一些新问题需要积极解决。为此，各地现在正根据中央的指示，紧密结合冬季生产和即将到来的春季生产，对农村公社进行整顿和巩固的工作。
