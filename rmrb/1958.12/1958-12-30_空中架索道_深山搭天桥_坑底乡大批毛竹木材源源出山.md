    Aerial Cableway Erected, Sky Bridge Built in Deep Mountains
    Large Quantities of Mao Bamboo and Timber From Kengdi Township Flow Out of the Mountains
    (By Our Newspaper) News - Kengdi Township in the northern mountainous region of Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, has adopted an aerial cable transportation method to develop its mountain resources.
    Kengdi Township is rich in local products such as Mao bamboo, charcoal, and firewood. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, large quantities of Mao bamboo and timber rotted in the mountains.
    Workers from the North Mountain Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative, together with the masses of Kengdi Township, after more than two months of hard work, built an aerial transportation line of more than twenty *li*. Large quantities of bamboo, firewood, and charcoal are transported out of the deep mountains through this aerial cableway, crossing high mountains, steep ridges, streams, and terraced fields. In the past, it took twelve hours to transport Mao bamboo and timber from Likeng to Kengkou by shoulder carrying, but now it only takes fourteen minutes. Based on the township's annual output of 60,000 Mao bamboo poles, 7 million *jin* of firewood, and 5,000 *dan* of charcoal, a total of more than 67,000 workdays can be saved annually.

    空中架索道  深山搭天桥
    坑底乡大批毛竹木材源源出山
    本报讯  浙江省青田县北山区坑底乡采用空中架线运输的方法，开发了山区资源。
    坑底乡毛竹、木炭、木柴等土产资源十分丰富。过去因为运输不便，大批毛竹、木材烂在山里。
    北山区供销合作社职工同坑底乡群众一起，经过两个多月的努力，建起了一条二十多华里的空中运输线。大批竹、柴、木炭通过这种空中索道，越过高山、峻岭、溪涧、梯田，源源运出深山。过去，从李坑到坑口运毛竹、木材，肩挑一次需要十二小时，现在只要十四分钟。按这个乡年产六万支毛竹、七百万斤木柴、五千担木炭计算，全年可以节省劳动力六万七千多个。（附图片）
