Letters from Patients

Achieving Greater Success
To the responsible comrades of the Chinese Medicine Research Institute, Dr. Du:

I am Hao Changkuan, a physical education teacher at the Seventh Railway Primary School of the Beijing Railway Bureau. Last year, I accidentally injured my wrist during work, and the injury was very serious. After multiple treatments at the railway hospital and other hospitals, none were effective. This situation was a great blow to a young man who wanted to dedicate his life to sports. To change careers? I had already spent six or seven years working in sports, and I was unwilling. To not change careers? This wrist affected my progress, and I was truly distressed. I had no choice but to go to the Chinese Medicine Research Institute. Unexpectedly, after only two or three treatments by Dr. Du Ziming of your institute, I was cured. My wrist recovered to its original condition, and I was able to practice on the parallel bars again at school. I was so grateful that I shed tears.

Soon after, I injured my neck and sternum during training. I immediately went to Dr. Du again. After Dr. Du and the entire staff of the treatment room gave me careful treatment, I quickly recovered.

After my body recovered, I actively trained. Now I have reached the level of a third-grade gymnast, and some of my events are approaching the second-grade level. I am able to achieve these results, first and foremost, thanks to Dr. Du's help. Today, the Party calls on us sports workers to work hard for ten years to bring our sports to the world level. I will definitely respond to this call, work hard and practice diligently. At the end of this year, I will bring my greater achievements in sports and work to see Dr. Du and the entire staff of the treatment room.

My Child Can Walk Again
Respected Doctor Zhao Xiwu and all the doctors and nurses of the pediatrics department:

We are the parents of Zhou Jianli, a polio patient. When we discovered the symptoms in our child on July 20, we immediately sent the child to the Children's Hospital for treatment. However, after the examination, the doctor told us: there is currently no specific medicine for this disease, and it will take at least half a year or even two years to recover, and that there may be sequelae, etc. We were very anxious when we heard these words, and the mental pressure was great. In order to save our child, we sent him to the Chinese Medicine Research Institute. After treatment by both Chinese and Western doctors, especially Dr. Zhao, our child completely recovered in less than a month. Initially, when we saw that our child who could already walk suddenly couldn't walk anymore, how anxious we were! Now, our child can run around again, and how happy the parents are! This feeling of gratitude cannot be expressed in a few words.

We admire Dr. Zhao's superb medical skills and rich clinical experience. In the treatment process, every dose of medicine he prescribed had a significant effect. The medicine not only reduces the pain of the patient compared to acupuncture, but also eliminates other diseases (such as indigestion, etc.). We believe that the Chinese Medicine Research Institute needs to summarize the drug treatment of polio.

Good Cooperation Between Chinese and Western Medicine
Respected Party Committee and leaders of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital:

My child, Li Fangji, was admitted to the Children's Hospital due to asthmatic bronchitis and pneumonia. After being admitted to the hospital, the child was still wheezing very badly, sometimes wheezing continuously for three or four hours, and the condition was critical. The hospital doctors believed that there was little hope of saving him. In great anxiety, I suggested that the Children's Hospital invite Dr. Qi Zhenhua of your hospital for a consultation.

After Dr. Qi came to the Children's Hospital for a consultation, the child improved after taking the first dose of medicine. After four more diagnoses and treatments, the child is about to recover.

In the treatment process, Dr. Qi and the doctors at the Children's Hospital truly cooperated closely. The doctors at the Children's Hospital humbly asked Dr. Qi for advice, and Dr. Qi patiently explained the medical principles and methods to them. Therefore, the child received timely treatment and saved his life. I think the method of cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine is really great. Through this incident, I deeply realized that the Party's policy of cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, learning from each other's strengths, and carrying forward the legacy of the motherland's medicine is very wise.

Heartfelt Gratitude
To the responsible comrades of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital:

I am writing this letter mainly to thank Dr. Yang Yinong of your hospital for saving my child, Huo Wanli.

On November 4, my child was sent to the Dongsi Children's Hospital for treatment due to tonsillitis and toxic pneumonia. After being admitted to the hospital, he had a high fever for several days and was in a coma. Although he took many antibiotics and antipyretic pills, and used methods such as blood plasma transfusion, glucose injection, and saline solution, the fever did not subside. I had no choice but to invite Dr. Yang of your hospital for a consultation. On November 8, after the child took a dose of Chinese medicine prescribed by Dr. Yang, he had four bowel movements in one day, and his body temperature dropped to normal. The next day, he was out of danger and woke up. After a few more days of treatment, the child gradually returned to normal. I think there are many treatment methods in Chinese medicine that are worth learning from Western medicine.

    病人来信     
    拿更大的成绩
    去见杜大夫中医研究院负责同志：
    我是北京铁路局第七铁路小学的体育教员，名叫郝长宽。去年，我在工作中不慎把手腕弄伤了，伤情很严重，经铁路医院和其他医院多次治疗，都无效。这种情况给一个愿意终身为体育事业服务的青年人很大的打击，改行吧，已经在体育方面下过六、七年的功夫，不甘心；不改行吧，这手腕又影响着我的进步，真是苦闷极了。不得已，我又跑到中医研究院，谁知经过你院杜自明老大夫两三次治疗竟好了，手腕恢复到和原来一样，回到学校又能在双杠上拿起大顶锻炼了，我真是感激得流下泪来。
    不久，我在锻炼时又把颈部胸骨弄伤了，我连忙又找到杜老大夫，经过杜老大夫和治疗室全体工作人员的细心治疗，很快又好了。
    我的身体恢复之后，就积极地锻炼身体，现在我已达到三级体操运动员的水平，有的项目已接近了二级。我能够有这些成绩，首先要感谢杜老大夫对我的帮助。今天党号召我们体育工作者苦干十年，将我们的运动项目达到世界水平，我一定响应这个号召，苦干苦练，今年年底我将拿着我在体育方面和工作方面更大的成绩去看杜老和治疗室全体工作人员。

    孩子又会走了尊敬的赵锡武大夫并小儿科全体大
  夫及护理同志们：
    我们是小儿麻痹症患者周健丽的家长，当我们在7月20日发现孩子有这种症状后，立即把孩子送到儿童医院医治。但是检查后大夫告诉我们：这种病目前还无特效药，至少要半年甚至两年才能痊愈，并说可能有后遗症等。我们听了这些话非常着急，精神上的威胁很大。为了救孩子，我们又把他送到中医研究院，经过中西大夫一齐治疗，特别是赵老大夫的治疗，在不到一个月的时间内，孩子的病完全好了。起初，当我们看到已经会走的孩子突然不会走了的时候，心情是多么焦急呀！现在，我们的孩子又能满地跑了，做父母的心情又是多么舒畅呀！这种感激的心情，不是用三言两语能表达出来呢。
    我们对赵老大夫这种高超的医学技术，和丰富的临床经验很佩服。在治疗过程中，他开的每一付药都有显著的效果。药物不但比针灸给患儿减少痛苦，而且还能消除其他疾病（如消化不良等）。我们认为中医研究院有总结药物治疗小儿麻痹症的必要。

    中西医合作好敬爱的中医医院院党委、院首长：
    我的孩子李方纪因患喘息性支气管炎和肺炎，送入儿童医院。入院以后，患儿还是喘息得很厉害，有时连续喘息三四小时之久，病情危急，医院大夫认为挽救希望不大。在万分焦虑中，我建议儿童医院请你院祁振华老大夫会诊。
    祁大夫到儿童医院会诊后，孩子吃了第一剂药即见好转，又经过四次诊断、治疗，患儿即将痊愈。
    在治疗过程中，祁老大夫和儿童医院的大夫们真正做到了密切合作，儿童医院的大夫虚心向祁大夫请教，祁老大夫也耐心地向他们解释医疗的道理和方法，因此患儿得到及时治疗，挽救了生命。我认为中西医合作的办法真太好了，通过这件事，我深刻体会到党提出的中西医合作，取长补短，发扬祖国医学遗产的政策是十分英明的。

      衷心的感激中医医院负责同志：
    我写这封信主要是感谢你院杨艺农大夫救活了我的孩子霍万里。
    11月4日，孩子因扁桃腺发炎及中毒性肺炎送到东四儿童医院治疗。入院后连日体温很高，昏迷不醒。虽然服用了许多抗生素、退热药片，并用了输血浆、注射葡萄糖、盐水等办法，还是不退烧。不得已请了你院扬大夫前来会诊。11月8日，孩子吃了杨大夫开的一付中药，一天拉了四次大便，体温就下降到正常，第二天便脱离险境，清醒过来。接着又治疗了几天，孩子就逐渐恢复正常了。我认为中医里有许多治疗方法是值得西医学习的。
