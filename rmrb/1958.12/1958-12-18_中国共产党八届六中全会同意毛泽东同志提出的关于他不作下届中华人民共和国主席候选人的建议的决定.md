For several years, Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly proposed to the Central Committee that he wishes to no longer continue to hold the post of Chairman of the People's Republic of China. After full and multi-faceted consideration, the Central Committee decided to agree to Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal and will not nominate him as a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China at the first meeting of the Second National People's Congress. The Central Committee believes that this is a completely positive suggestion. Because Comrade Mao Zedong does not hold the position of Head of State, but focuses solely on being Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, this can enable him to concentrate more on dealing with issues concerning the Party and the country's direction, policies, and line. It may also free up more of his time to engage in Marxist-Leninist theoretical work, without hindering his continued leadership role in national work. This is more beneficial to the entire Party and the people of the whole country. Comrade Mao Zedong is the long-tested leader wholeheartedly loved by the people of all nationalities in the country. After he no longer holds the position of Head of State, he will still be the leader of the people of all nationalities in the country. In the future, if some special circumstances arise that require him to take on this job again, he can still be nominated to hold the position of Head of State based on the opinions of the people and the decision of the Party. Party committees at all levels should, based on these reasons, conduct full explanations to cadres and the masses both inside and outside the Party at appropriate Party meetings, at meetings of people's congresses at all levels, at gatherings of workers in industrial and mining enterprises, at gatherings in people's communes, and at gatherings in government offices, schools, and military units, so that everyone understands the reasons for this matter and does not misunderstand it.

    中国共产党八届六中全会同意毛泽东同志提出的关于他不作下届中华人民共和国主席候选人的建议的决定
    （一九五八年十二月十日）
    几年以来，毛泽东同志曾经多次向中央提出，希望不再继续担任中华人民共和国主席的职务。中央全会在经过了充分的、多方面的考虑以后，决定同意毛泽东同志这个提议，在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，不再提他作为中华人民共和国主席的候选人。中央全会认为，这完全是一个积极的建议。因为毛泽东同志不担任国家主席的职务，专做党中央的主席，可以使他更能够集中精力来处理党和国家的方针、政策、路线的问题，也有可能使他腾出较多的时间，从事马克思列宁主义的理论工作，而并不妨碍他对于国家工作继续发挥领导作用。这样，对于全党和全国人民都更为有利。毛泽东同志是全国各族人民衷心爱戴的久经考验的领袖，在他不再担任国家主席的职务以后，他仍然是全国各族人民的领袖。在将来，如果出现某种特殊情况需要他再担任这种工作的时候，仍然可以根据人民的意见和党的决定，再提他担任国家主席的职务。各级党委应当根据这些理由，在党的适当会议上，在各级人民代表大会会议上，在工矿企业工人的集会上，在人民公社的集会上，在机关、学校、部队的集会上，向党内党外的干部和群众进行充分的解释，以便大家了解这件事的理由，而不致有所误解。
