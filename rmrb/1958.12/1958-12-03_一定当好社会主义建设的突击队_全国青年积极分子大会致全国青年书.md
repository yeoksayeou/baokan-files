Dear young comrades across the country:

We, five thousand young people from all fronts of the country, are attending the Second National Conference of Youth Socialist Construction Activists in Beijing, the capital of our great motherland. Now, with excitement, let us tell you that this conference, held under the close care of the Party Central Committee, is an advancement conference for promoting the communist spirit and accelerating the construction of socialism. During the conference, the esteemed Vice Chairman Zhu De gave us important instructions on behalf of the Party Central Committee. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League made a report to us. We reported to the Party and the motherland on the achievements of the nation's youth in the Great Leap Forward and exchanged experiences. In these days, we have received extremely profound education, further clarified the direction of our progress, and greatly stimulated our enthusiasm for building socialism. We ordinary young people have only done a part of the work we should have done, and the Party and the people have given us such high praise. This earnest concern and encouragement from the Party for the younger generation has deeply moved us. We will never fail the Party's hopes. We will certainly listen to the Party's teachings and forever be the Party's loyal children.

Our motherland is in the era of the greatest leap forward in history. In this year of the Great Leap Forward, grain and cotton are likely to increase by double compared to last year, and steel production can certainly be doubled compared to last year. Scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings are also developing at high speed. The rural areas of our country have basically realized the people's commune system. All of this has laid a new foundation for accelerating the socialist construction of our country. Such a high rate of development in our country's construction is unprecedented in history. This is a great victory for the Party's General Line. The correct leadership of the Party combined with the enthusiasm of 600 million people can generate enormous material strength, overcome all difficulties, and create great miracles that turn the world upside down.

The Party teaches us that the task of the people of the whole country at this stage is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to prepare conditions for the future transition from socialism to communism. Because our country's current level of production is still very low and the material foundation is not yet solid, the realization of such a task cannot but go through a difficult journey. However, we have every possibility to complete this journey in a relatively short period of time. The youth of our country must, as the Party requires, work with the people of the whole country to develop our country's industry and agriculture at high speed, so that the whole country is industrialized, the people's communes are industrialized, agricultural production is mechanized and electrified, and scientific and cultural undertakings are raised to the advanced levels of the world. By that time, we will be able to gradually eliminate the serious differences between industry and agriculture, city and countryside, mental labor and physical labor, and gradually transition from socialism to communism. It is the greatest glory and happiness for us young people to be able to contribute our strength and wisdom to this magnificent cause. We must certainly act as the heroic shock force in the cause of socialist construction. We must certainly make the great communist ideal a glorious reality in the hands of our generation.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, we must work selflessly. The Party teaches us that all the wealth in the world is created by labor. Without hard work, it is impossible to build socialism. We must regard labor as the primary need of our lives. In our work, we must carry forward the spirit of not caring about rewards, not being afraid of difficulties, and going wherever we are needed. There is no distinction between high and low in labor. In any ordinary labor, we can create extraordinary miracles. Collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries are related to the lives of hundreds of millions of people, the growth of tens of millions of children, and the further liberation and development of social productive forces. We must regard these collective welfare undertakings as noble work serving the people and strive to do them well.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, we must study tenaciously. The Party teaches us that only by becoming people with communist consciousness and cultural and scientific knowledge can we shoulder the heavy responsibility of building socialism. We must carry out a movement to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Mao Zedong. We must strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge and closely integrate learning with labor. In learning, we must avoid any one-sidedness. We must learn from practice and become versatile in production, and we must also read seriously and absorb all useful knowledge. We must advance towards the goal of "intellectualizing workers and peasants, and laborizing intellectuals," and cultivate ourselves into new people who are both red and expert, and combine mental labor with physical labor.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, we must hold high the red flag in our thinking and constantly improve our communist consciousness. The Party teaches us that the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads has not ended in politics and ideology, and that "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" is still a very important task. In our era, individualism and departmentalism, these bourgeois styles of thinking, are incompatible with our cause, hindering progress, and binding our hands and feet. We must make a complete break with these bourgeois ideas, promote the communist spirit of selflessness, unity and mutual assistance, and subordination of individual interests to collective interests and local interests to overall interests, so that our generation of young people becomes the noblest and most promising generation in history.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, we must continue to invigorate the fearless spirit of creation and closely combine this spirit with the style of seeking truth from facts. The Party teaches us that to accomplish our unprecedented great cause, we must break superstitions, liberate our minds, and have the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. True daring to think and act is inseparable from seeking truth from facts. Any creation is the result of valuing reality, studying reality, and grasping the laws of objective development. Being down-to-earth, creating bravely, doing what we say, and never exaggerating are the traditional styles of our Party, and we must inherit and carry forward these styles.

In order to accelerate the construction of socialism, we must also strengthen our firm will to defend the motherland and learn to master military technology. The Party teaches us that as long as imperialism exists, we cannot relax our vigilance and struggle against it for a single day. We must liberate the territory of the motherland, Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and complete the unification of the motherland. The youth of the troops standing at the forefront of national defense must strive to study Chairman Mao's military thought, improve military science and technology, and fight for the modernization of national defense. The youth of our whole country must actively participate in militia training, everyone should know how to shoot a gun, and everyone should be able to fight, becoming people who are both literate and military. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If the American aggressors dare to impose war on us, we must drown them in the ocean of all people being soldiers.

Comrades, in another month, we will enter 1959. 1959 is a decisive year in which the Party calls on us to "fight hard for three years and fundamentally change the face of the motherland," and it is also the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The youth of all walks of life should, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to carry forward the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift and hard struggle, muster greater efforts, and strive to continue to double the growth of industrial and agricultural production in our country, to consolidate the people's communes, and to strive for greater leaps forward in all aspects of work.

Comrades, with the wise leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, the unity and common efforts of all ethnic groups in the country, and the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we will certainly be able to build our great motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Let us hold high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and advance courageously!

Long live our dear motherland!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live our respected leader and teacher Chairman Mao!

December 2, 1958

    一定当好社会主义建设的突击队
    全国青年积极分子大会致全国青年书亲爱的全国青年同志们：
    我们来自全国各个战线的五千个青年，在我们伟大祖国的首都北京，出席了第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。现在让我们怀着激动的心情告诉你们，这次大会是在党中央的亲切关怀下举行的，是一次发扬共产主义精神、加速建设社会主义的进军大会。大会期间，敬爱的朱德副主席代表党中央给我们作了重要指示。共青团中央给我们做了报告。我们向党和祖国汇报了全国青年在大跃进中的战绩，交流了经验。在这些日子里，我们受到了极为深刻的教育，我们更加明确了前进的方向，更大地激发了建设社会主义的干劲。我们这些普普通通的青年，只是做到了自己应该做的一部分工作，党和人民就给了我们这么高的评价。党对青年一代的这种殷切关怀和鼓励，使我们受到深深的感动。我们决不辜负党的希望。我们一定听从党的教导，永远做党的忠实儿女。
    我们祖国正处在历史上最伟大的飞跃发展的时代。在大跃进的这一年中，粮食和棉花都有可能比去年增产一倍，钢铁产量也可以肯定比去年要翻一番，科学文教事业也在高速度地向前发展。我国农村已经基本实现了人民公社化。这一切就为加速我国的社会主义建设奠定了新的基础。我国建设事业这样高的发展速度，是历史上从来没有过的，这是党的总路线的伟大胜利。党的正确领导和六亿人民的积极性相结合，就能产生巨大的物质力量，就能战胜一切困难，创造出天翻地复的伟大奇迹。
    党教导我们，全国人民现阶段的任务，就是要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，并且为将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义准备条件。由于我国现在的生产水平还很低，物质基础还不雄厚，实现这样的任务还不能不经历一段艰巨的路程。但是我们有充分可能用较短的时间走完这个路程。我国青年一定要像党所要求的那样，同全国人民一道，高速度发展我国的工业和农业，使全国工业化、人民公社工业化、农业生产机械化、电气化，并且把科学文化事业提高到世界先进水平。到了那时，我们就有可能逐步地消灭工业和农业、城市和乡村、脑力劳动和体力劳动的严重差别，就有可能逐步地由社会主义过渡到共产主义。我们青年能够把自己的力量和智慧贡献给这个壮丽的事业，实在是最大的光荣和幸福。我们一定要充当社会主义建设事业的英勇的突击队。我们一定要使伟大的共产主义理想在我们这一代手中变成光辉的现实。
    为了加速建设社会主义，我们就要忘我地劳动。党教导我们，世界上的一切财富，都是劳动创造的。没有辛勤的劳动就不可能建设社会主义。我们要把劳动看成我们生活的第一需要。我们在劳动中要发扬那种不计较报酬，不害怕困难，哪里需要就到哪里去的精神。劳动是没有高低贵贱之分的。在任何平凡的劳动中，都可以创造不平凡的奇迹。公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所这些集体福利事业，关系到几亿人民的生活，关系到几千万儿童的成长，关系到社会生产力的进一步解放和发展。我们要把这些集体福利事业看成是为人民服务的崇高工作，一定努力把它办好。
    为了加速建设社会主义，我们就要顽强地学习。党教导我们，只有成为有共产主义觉悟和有文化科学知识的人，才能担负起建设社会主义的重任。我们要开展学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的运动。我们要努力学习文化科学知识，把学习和劳动紧密地结合起来。在学习中，我们要避免任何片面性，我们既要从实践中学习，做生产上的多面手，也要认真读书，吸取一切有用的知识。我们要向着“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”的目标前进，把自己培养成为又红又专、脑力劳动同体力劳动相结合的新人。
    为了加速建设社会主义，我们就要在思想上高插红旗，不断提高共产主义觉悟。党教导我们，在政治上和思想上社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争还没有结束，“兴无灭资”仍然是一项极重要的任务。在我们的时代里，个人主义、本位主义，这些资产阶级的思想作风，都是同我们的事业不相容的，都是妨害进步，捆绑我们手脚的绳索。我们要同这些资产阶级的思想作彻底的决裂，发扬大公无私、团结互助、个人利益服从集体利益、局部利益服从整体利益的共产主义精神，使我们这一代青年成为历史上最高尚、最有作为的一代。
    为了加速建设社会主义，我们要继续振奋大无畏的创造精神，并且把这种精神同实事求是的作风密切结合起来。党教导我们，要完成我们史无前例的伟大事业，就必须破除迷信，解放思想，具有敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。真正的敢想敢做又是和实事求是分不开的。任何创造都是重视实际、研究实际、掌握了客观发展规律的结果。脚踏实地，勇敢创造，说到做到，决不虚夸，这是我们党的传统作风，我们一定要把这种作风继承和发扬起来。
    为了加速建设社会主义，我们还必须增强保卫祖国的坚强意志，学习掌握军事技术。党教导我们，帝国主义存在一天，我们就一天也不能放松对它的警惕和斗争。我们一定要解放祖国的领土台、澎、金、马，完成祖国的统一。站在国防最前线的部队青年，要努力学习毛主席的军事思想，提高军事科学技术，为国防现代化而斗争。我们全国青年，都要积极参加民兵训练，人人会放枪，个个能打仗，成为能文能武的人。我们热爱和平，但决不害怕战争，如果美国侵略者胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就一定要把它淹没在全民皆兵的海洋里。
    同志们，再过一个月，我们就要进入1959年了。1959年是党号召我们“苦战三年，基本改变祖国面貌”的具有决定性的一年，也是中华人民共和国建国十周年。我们各行各业的青年，应当和全国人民一起，坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，继续发扬勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的精神，鼓足更大的干劲，为使我国工农业生产继续成倍地增长，为巩固人民公社和争取各方面工作更大的跃进而斗争。
    同志们，有伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导，有全国各族人民的团结一致和共同努力，还有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的有力支持，我们一定能够把我们的伟大祖国，建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家。让我们高举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，奋勇前进！
    我们亲爱的祖国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
