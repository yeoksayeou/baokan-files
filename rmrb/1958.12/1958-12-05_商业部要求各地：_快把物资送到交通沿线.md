Ministry of Commerce Requires All Regions:
　　Quickly Send Materials to Transportation Routes

　　(Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Commerce convened a national telephone conference of directors of commerce bureaus on the evening of the 3rd. In addition to deploying the current large-scale purchasing and sales work of commercial departments, the conference specifically required all regions to do a good job in the crash transportation of commercial materials around the 10th of this month. Wu Xuezhi, Vice Minister of Commerce, said at the meeting that this large-scale crash transportation will play a significant role in improving the supply of certain light industrial raw materials and easing the supply of materials in the market. All regions must attach great importance to this work, fully prepare everything, and fight well in this battle of commercial crash transportation. He said that the most important preparation work at present is to do a good job in short-distance transportation, quickly gathering materials scattered in people's communes or processing plants to transportation routes. He suggested that commercial departments in various regions cooperate with transportation departments to help people's communes establish professional transportation teams. These professional transportation teams can be fixed on a transportation line for transportation, or they can specialize in transporting a certain type of commodity, becoming a regular transportation force. However, in the current situation of vigorously carrying out crash transportation, relying solely on this professional team is not enough. This requires the unified arrangement and organization of more labor through the Party committee, and the extensive use of folk transportation tools for crash transportation. That is to say, the spirit of combining crash transportation and regular transportation should also be implemented in short-distance transportation.

　　Wu Xuezhi also required commercial departments in various regions to actively strengthen contact and cooperation with local railway administrations in this crash transportation; regions, shipping units, and receiving units should also strengthen cooperation and contact. In his speech, he particularly recommended the "marshal leading logistics" transportation method created by the Shanghai Railway Bureau, requiring all regions to quickly promote it, and hoping that all regions would further mobilize the broad masses of workers to continue to create more new methods in tapping transportation potential.

    商业部要求各地：
    快把物资送到交通沿线
    本报讯  商业部在3日晚召开全国商业厅、局长电话会议。会议除部署了当前商业部门的大购大销等工作以外，特别要求各地做好本月10日左右的商业物资突击运输工作。商业部副部长吴雪之在会上说，这次规模较大的突击运输，对于改善某些轻工业原料供应和缓和市场物资供应将起很大的作用，各地必须十分重视这一工作，充分做好一切准备，打好商业突击运输这一仗。他说，目前准备工作中最主要的是要做好短途运输工作，迅速把分散在人民公社或加工厂的物资集运到交通沿线。他建议各地商业部门和交通部门配合，帮助人民公社建立专业运输队，这种专业运输队可以固定在一条交通线上进行运输，也可以专门运输某一种商品，成为一支经常性运输大军。但是在当前大搞突击运输的情况下，光靠这支专业队是不够的，这就要通过党委统一安排组织更多的劳动力，广泛利用民间运输工具进行突击调运。也就是说在短途运输中同样要贯彻突击运输和经常运输相结合的精神。
    吴雪之还要求各地商业部门在这次突击运输中要主动和各地铁路管理局加强联系和协作；各地区之间、发货单位和接货单位之间也要加强协作联系。他在讲话中特别推荐上海铁路局创造的“元帅带后勤”的运输办法，要求各地迅速加以推广，并且希望各地进一步发动广大职工在挖掘运输潜力方面继续创造更多新的办法。
