Glorious Cause, Noble People
By our correspondent

    Since the communization, many new figures have emerged in Mao Village, Hongqi Commune, Gaocheng County, Hebei Province. People can see from the newly established service organizations of the People's Commune that ordinary laborers with noble qualities are serving the commune members tirelessly.

    Kindergarten Better Than Home
    "If it weren't for the new society and you girls, I don't know what my son Xinheng would have become!" Every time Xinheng's mother sees the educators at the Mao Village Kindergarten, she always holds their hands and repeats the above sentence. The masses and cadres in the village also often praise, commenting, "The girls working at the kindergarten are really good!"

    Why do people praise the educators at the Mao Village Kindergarten like this? It turns out that Shen Xinheng, now a "model little squad leader" in the kindergarten, was a notorious "bully" before entering the kindergarten. Although he was only six years old, he spent his days provoking cats and dogs, causing trouble everywhere. His mother was troubled by his actions, causing discord among the sisters-in-law and disharmony with the neighbors, and worried about him all day long. However, this naughty child, under the education of Shen Lanzhi and Shen Shuling, young eighteen-year-old girls and educators, has become a polite and well-behaved child.

    In order to establish a kindergarten, the Mao Village Party Branch specially selected Shen Lanzhi and Shen Shuling, two Communist Youth League members, from the production team to serve as educators. Both of them are skilled in production and active members of the club. Shen Lanzhi has four years of schooling, and Shen Shuling has just shed her illiteracy. Neither of them had any common sense or experience in managing children. Many well-intentioned people worried about Shen Lanzhi and Shen Shuling. But they had one belief: that under the leadership of the Party, they could educate the children well. After the kindergarten was established, Shen Xinheng was the first to enroll. They were determined to educate Shen Xinheng well, analyze his characteristics, and educate him according to his characteristics. Under their patient education, this child simply became another person, very polite to people, and even helped his mother sweep the floor and wipe the table when he returned home. His mother happily said, "My Xinheng has improved more in one month in the kindergarten than in a year at home."

    People's praise for the kindergarten is inseparable from Shen Lanzhi and Shen Shuling's tenacious and continuous overcoming of difficulties, and their selfless labor for the second generation of the motherland. The Mao Village Kindergarten was established after August this year. At that time, many people did not realize the significance of the kindergarten. Therefore, in the process of its establishment, they often encountered indifference. Someone once advised Shen Shuling: "It's better for you to produce in the team. What future is there in taking care of other people's children?"

    However, these two girls, like the advanced figures emerging in the communization movement across the country, excellently completed their tasks in extremely difficult environments. When the kindergarten was first established and had no houses, they led the children to play by the village. To enhance the children's nutrition, they ground rice and cooked for the children themselves. They knew that they had little education and experience, so they asked the primary school teachers to teach the children to sing and dance. To prepare lessons, they often stayed up late. Now the number of educators in the kindergarten has increased to five, and the number of children has increased from thirty to one hundred and fifty. The kindergarten has spacious houses and electric lights installed.

    The people of Mao Village have composed four lines of poetry for the kindergarten: "Kindergarten better than home, Aunties and teachers better than mothers, Children are all fat and strong, Lively and lovely like flowers," to praise the educators and the achievements of the kindergarten.

    Better Than One's Own Daughter
    Speaking of Li Lianmei, the only service worker in the Happiness Home, none of the elderly in the Happiness Home do not praise her. They all say that Lianmei is a really good girl, better than one's own daughter.

    Li Lianmei is forty-five years old this year. She takes care of forty-one elderly people alone, fetching water, heating the kang, washing clothes, and folding quilts for the elderly every day. She takes extra care of the four blind elderly people, filling their bowls one after another when they eat; afraid that the toothless elderly can't chew well, she specially uses chopsticks to crush the food; she cares for the sick elderly even more, making noodles and whisking eggs for them herself. During the tense autumn harvest, some elderly people who refuse to admit they are old want to go to the fields to pick cotton and dig yams. Lianmei accompanies the old women to the fields, for fear that they will fall and get hurt. Lianmei's service attitude moved the elderly to often say: We have been assigned such a good person.

    What satisfies the elderly the most is that Lianmei often tries to find ways to make the elderly happy. Everyone praises her for being lively and talkative. When the elderly are sunbathing and chatting in the yard, Lianmei sings folk songs in a loud voice or tells jokes and stories, and she is happy only when she makes the elderly laugh. Under Li Lianmei's enthusiastic care, the Happiness Home is filled with a joyful atmosphere all day long.

    Li Lianmei has been suffering all her life since she had no parents since she was a child. After liberation, she actively worked and was elected as the village's women's committee member. Two months ago, she requested to work as a service worker in the Happiness Home. Li Lianmei is very satisfied with her work. She often says to people: "I have found my mother's home."

    Popular Midwife
    Now, the women of Mao Village no longer have to worry about the safety of childbirth. A maternity hospital has been established here. In particular, there is a midwife in the maternity hospital named Lian Wuniang, who not only has skilled midwifery techniques, but also selflessly labors for the mothers and infants.

    Although Lian Wuniang is already fifty-five years old, she is more diligent than young people. Since becoming a midwife, she has always lived in the maternity hospital, rarely returning home, for fear of delaying midwifery work, and taking care of mothers and infants day and night. After giving birth, she always washes and wraps the baby, and also cooks millet porridge for the mother herself. She only stops to rest after everything is arranged. She also washes diapers for the baby and strives to make some easily digestible food for the mother to eat. She firmly advocates that women should rest quietly in the hospital for fifteen days after childbirth before leaving the hospital, for fear that leaving the hospital too early will harm their health. Everyone who comes to Mao Village often hears praise for this warm-hearted Lian Wuniang from the mouths of male and female commune members.

    Since Mao Village established a maternity hospital in June this year, Lian Wuniang was the first to join the work. At that time, the maternity hospital only had a few empty rooms, with no medical equipment and no people. With the support of the Party branch, Lian Wuniang ran around and finally found two young assistants. Lian Wuniang also built stoves for the maternity hospital herself. After Lian Wuniang's hard work, the maternity hospital was finally built. Now, this rural maternity hospital has three delivery rooms, one of which is a delivery room with a kang suitable for rural habits, a wooden operating table, and sufficient medical equipment. From June to now, Lian Wuniang has delivered fifty little citizens.

    Lian Wuniang has a set of "combining indigenous and foreign" midwifery techniques. Thirty years ago, she learned old-fashioned midwifery from her mother. After liberation, she studied new midwifery techniques in a training class in Gaocheng County. Because of her careful study, she has combined the advantages of the old and new midwifery methods and made many resuscitation achievements. This summer, Zhao Haihan's wife in Shang Village fell during her eighth month of pregnancy and was about to miscarry. Lian Wuniang, who had liberated her mind, immediately and boldly performed the delivery, ensuring the safety of both the mother and the infant. When talking about this incident, Lian Wuniang always waved her hand and said, "Who says that seven months alive, eight months dead? That's not true."

    Lian Wuniang said that she is old, and the midwifery work is very tense, and sometimes she feels a little tired, but when she sees the mother and infant sleeping peacefully in bed, she is so happy that she forgets her fatigue.

    The "Fat Meat" Joke
    Shen Luoen, the cook at the Mao Village Third Canteen, narrowed his smiling eyes into a line and leaned back and forth as he told people a very interesting story: One day at noon, all the tables in each dining hall were full of people. Suddenly, Zhou Nizi, a woman in her thirties, said loudly to the administrator: I don't want to eat big fatty meat today, make something else for me. At that time, people burst into laughter. It turned out that the big fatty meat she was talking about was one of the dozens of dishes made from sweet potatoes by the catering staff of this canteen under the slogan of "eat potatoes but don't see potatoes" - sweet potato meat.

    Shen Luoen, a sixty-two-year-old cook, played an active role in this canteen, which has been rated as an advanced canteen twice in a row. Shen Luoen came from a poor peasant background, and his lifelong family economic status has cultivated his character of loving hard work and being good at thinking. Since he was hired as a cook after the establishment of the commune canteen, in early October, when the four labor canteens in Mao Village started a competition, Shen Luoen started working on sweet potatoes. He thought that if many kinds of dishes were made with the abundant harvest of sweet potatoes, it could not only increase the appetite of the commune members, but also save grain. Imitating the "red and white meat" made with flour in the past, he grated the sweet potatoes into shreds, mixed them with a small amount of flour, added a little color, and steamed them into "sweet potato meat" that looked like real pork. He said: "With this, you can cut it into many kinds of squares and lengths, with fresh patterns, and people love to eat it." Shen Luoen alone created more than a dozen other things such as "sweet potato tofu" and "meatballs". Every time commune members ate a variety of dishes, they talked happily, saying that the canteen was really getting better and better. After commune member Shen Luozhi ate "sweet potato meat", he said: "Yams have become a treasure, both as food and as meat." Once, the Third Canteen entertained a canal visiting group from other places, and Shen Luoen showed his skills, proposing not to use a grain of food and guaranteeing that everyone would eat well and be full. The visiting group visited the canteen with gratitude and learned the technology of making "sweet potato meat".

    Shen Luoen's characteristic is that as long as it is for everyone's sake, he is always tireless. Since the establishment of the canteen, he has been getting up early and resting late every day. He said: It's worth it to be a little tired if it can make everyone a little happier and be good for the commune and the country!

    光荣的事业崇高的人
    本报记者
    河北省藁城县红旗公社的毛庄，在公社化后出现了许许多多新人物，人们可以从新建立起的人民公社的服务机构中，看到那些有着高贵品质的普通劳动者，正在不眠不休地为公社社员服务。
    幼儿园赛过家
    “要不是新社会、要不是你们几个闺女，俺那儿子心恒将来不知变个什么样子呢！”心恒娘一见到毛庄村幼儿园的教养员，总是拉着手反复地说着上面这句话。村里的群众和干部们也经常赞叹的评论着“在幼儿园里工作的几个闺女真好！”
    人们为什么这样称赞毛庄村幼儿园的教养员呢？原来现在幼儿园里当“模范小连长”的申心恒，在没有入园前，是个著名的“打人大王”。虽然他刚满六岁，但却整天招猫斗狗，到处惹事，他娘为他搞得妯娌不和，邻居不睦，整天为他操碎了心。这样调皮的孩子，却在十八岁的年轻姑娘、教养员申兰芝和申淑玲的教育下，变成了有礼貌、守规矩的孩子了。
    毛庄村党支部为了建立幼儿园，特意从生产队里抽调出申兰芝和申淑玲两个共青团员担任教养员，她俩都是生产能手，并且是俱乐部的积极分子。申兰芝读过四年书，申淑玲刚刚摘掉文盲帽子，她俩根本没有管理孩子的常识和经验。许多好心的人为申兰芝、申淑玲担心。但她们有一条信心，就是相信在党领导下，能把孩子教育好。办起幼儿园后，申心恒第一个入园。她俩决心要教育好申心恒，研究分析申心恒的特点，根据他的特点进行教育。在她们的耐心教育下，这孩子简直变成另外一个人，见人很有礼貌，回家还帮助他娘扫地抹桌子。他娘高兴地说：“俺家心恒入园一月，比在家一年还强得多。”
    人们对幼儿园这样赞扬，是和申兰芝、申淑玲顽强的不断克服困难，为祖国的第二代忘我劳动分不开的。毛庄的幼儿园是今年8月后建立的，当时许多人还认识不到幼儿园的意义，因此在开创过程中，经常碰到冷遇。曾经有人这样劝申淑玲：“你在队里生产多好，给人家带孩子有啥出息？”
    但是，这两位姑娘和在全国各地公社化运动中涌现出来的先进人物一样地在极困难的环境下出色地完成了任务。幼儿园刚成立没有房子，她们就领着孩子在村边上玩。为增强孩子的营养，她们就自己给孩子碾米作饭。她们知道自己文化低，经验少，就去请小学的老师教孩子们唱歌跳舞。为了备课，她们经常准备到深夜。现在幼儿园的教养员发展到五个，孩子已由三十人增加到一百五十人。幼儿园有了宽阔的房子，装上了电灯。
    毛庄的人们给幼儿园编了四句诗“幼儿园赛过家，阿姨老师赛过妈，孩子个个胖又壮，活泼可爱赛朵花。”来歌颂教养员和幼儿园的成绩。
    比亲闺女还强
    提起幸福院唯一的服务员李连梅，幸福院的老人没有一个不夸奖的，都说连梅真是个好闺女，比亲闺女还强。
    李连梅今年四十五岁，她一人照顾着四十一位老人，每天给老人们打水、烧炕、洗衣、叠被。她对四位双目失明的老人侍候得格外细心，吃饭时吃一碗盛一碗；怕没牙的老人嚼不烂，特地用筷子把吃的东西夹碎；对有病的老人更关怀倍至，亲手给他们做面片，冲鸡蛋。在秋收紧张的时候，有些不服老的老人们要到地里去摘棉花、拣山药，连梅便陪着老大娘们下地，只怕她们摔着碰着。连梅的服务态度感动得老人常说：把这么个好人给咱派来了。
    最使老人们满意的是，连梅常常想办法给老人们开心，大家都夸她心活，嘴会说。当老人们在院子里晒太阳聊天的时候，连梅就高声唱起小调或是讲个笑话，说个故事，总要把老人逗得哈哈大笑她才高兴。在李连梅热心的关照下，幸福院整天充满欢乐的气氛。
    李连梅从小没爹没娘，受了一辈子苦，解放后积极劳动，当选过村的妇女委员。两个来月前，她要求到幸福院担任服务员工作。李连梅非常满意她的工作，她常对人说：“我可找到娘家了。”
    人人欢迎的接生员
    现在，毛庄的妇女不再为产期的安全而提心吊胆了。这里已经成立了妇产院，特别是妇产院里有一位既掌握熟练助产技术、又能为产妇和婴儿而忘我劳动的接生员连五娘。
    连五娘虽然已经五十五岁了，但是她手脚比青年人还勤快。自从担任接生员以来，她老是住在妇产院里，很少回家，生怕误了助产工作，不分白天黑夜地看护着产妇和婴儿。她总是在接生以后把孩子洗完包好，还亲手给产妇煮好小米粥，一切都安排完了，才肯停下来休息。她还为婴儿洗尿布、争着给产妇作些好消化的东西吃，她坚决主张妇女在产后要在院里静养十五天后才离院，怕过早出院伤害了身体。凡是来到毛庄的人，都常常从男女社员们的口中听到对这位热心肠的连五娘的称赞。
  自从今年6月毛庄成立了妇产院以后，连五娘第一个参加了工作。那时，妇产院只有几间空房子，既没有什么医药设备，又没有人。连五娘在党支部的支持下，四处奔走，好容易才找来两位青年助手。连五娘自己还亲手给产院砌炉灶。经过连五娘的这番苦战，终于把妇产院建设成了。现在，这座农村妇产院已经有三间产间，其中一间是适合农村习惯的有火炕的产房，一架木制手术台和够用的医药器具。从6月到现在，连五娘已经接生了五十位小公民。
    连五娘有着一手“土洋结合”的接生技术。三十年前，从她娘那里学过旧法接生，解放后又在藁城县的训练班里学习过新法助产术，由于她细心钻研，已经把新旧接生法的优点结合起来，作出了不少起死回生的事迹。今年夏天，尚庄赵海含的爱人在妊娠八个月时摔了跤，眼看就要小产。解放了思想的连五娘立即大胆地进行了接生，使产妇和婴儿都很平安。连五娘在谈到这段事情时总是一摆手地说：“谁说七活八不活？没的事。”
    连五娘说，她年纪大了，助产工作很紧张，有时也感到有些劳累，但是一看到产妇和婴儿安稳地睡在床上，她就高兴得忘记了疲劳。
    “肥肉”的笑话
    毛庄第三食堂炊事员申洛恩，笑哈哈的眼睛眯成一条线，身子前仰后合的告诉人们一个很有趣的故事：一天中午，各个饭厅一桌一桌都坐满了人，忽然三十多岁的妇女周妮子高声高气的对管理员说：今天我不吃大肥肉，另给我做吧。当时，人们哄堂大笑起来。原来她所说的大肥肉，就是这个食堂的炊事人员在“吃薯不见薯”的号召下，用红薯做成的几十样菜当中的一种——红薯肉。
    六十二岁的老炊事员申洛恩在这个连续两次被评为先进食堂的食堂里起了积极的作用。申洛恩是贫农出身，他一生的家庭经济地位，养成他爱勤劳、好琢磨的性格。从公社食堂成立聘请他当炊事员以来，10月上旬，毛庄四个劳动食堂展开竞赛，申洛恩就在红薯上作开了文章。他想，如果用大量丰收的红薯来作出许多种菜，不仅可以增加社员们的食欲，也可以节约用粮。他模仿着过去人们用粉面作成的“红白肉”，把红薯擦成丝掺了很少的粉面，加了少许的颜色，上锅蒸成了和真猪肉一样的“红薯肉”。他说：“有了这个，就可把它切成方的长的许多种，花样新鲜，人们爱吃。”其他什么“红薯豆腐”、“丸子”等等，申洛恩一人就创造了十多种。每次当社员们吃到多种花样的饭菜时，都兴高采烈的谈论，食堂可真是越来越好了。社员申洛芝吃到“红薯肉”以后说：“山药成了宝，又当粮食又当肉。”有一次第三食堂招待外地来的渠道参观团，申洛恩就大显身手，提出不用一粒粮食，保证大家吃好吃饱。参观团以感激的心情参观了食堂，并且学习了做“红薯肉”的技术。
    申洛恩的特点是，只要是为大家的事，他总是不辞辛苦的。从成立食堂以来，他每天都是早起晚休息。他说：能使大家增加一点快活，对公社对国家有好处，辛苦一点又算什么呢！
