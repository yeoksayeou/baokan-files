    Steel, a definite 10.7 million tons!

    Steel, a definite 10.7 million tons! Today we learned that you have completed the task ahead of schedule, doubling last year's output. 650 million people are sincerely rejoicing. You produce as much as the Party wants, Steel Marshal, you truly have a high degree of discipline; you bravely obey the Party's command, you take the lead and rush to the high ground. The Grain Marshal, who took the lead, heard the sound of hoofbeats, and he reined in his horse and turned his head, also expressing joy: "Welcome, Comrade Steel, a sincere welcome! Let us gallop forward side by side again!" Steel Marshal, you answered very firmly: "We should thank the people led by the Party. One horse taking the lead still requires ten thousand horses galloping. We must obey the command of how fast the Party wants us to run." "Right!" The Grain Marshal also solidly agreed, "We must obey the command of how fast the Party wants us to run! Our horsepower is very sufficient, not only can we be fast, but we must also pursue being good and economical." "We also need to have a global perspective," Steel Marshal, you added to your discussion, "We must always serve all the people, and the required quantity must be based on possibility." "Right! The Party's leadership is all correct and wise, and the mass line is the reins of ten thousand galloping horses. The two of us have surveyed the path for the construction march, and we can march in rhythm according to the deployment." The sound of victory songs all around is soaring into the clouds, interrupting the answers and questions of the two marshals. The flags of victory are waving all over China, and heroes are leaping forward on every construction front. 1959 is coming in an instant, and it will bring the tenth solemn National Day. Every post is preparing to offer gifts, seeking truth from facts, striving for the upper reaches, and going all out. Steel, a definite 10.7 million tons! Today we learned that you have completed the task ahead of schedule. Everyone is striving to learn from you, so that 1959 will be even more prosperous than this year!

      郭沫若钢，铁定的1070万吨！今天知道了你已提前完成，把去年的产量整整翻了一番，六亿五千万人民都衷心庆幸。党要多少你就产生了多少，钢元帅真有高度的纪律性；你勇猛地服从着党的指挥，你一马当先地跑上了高岭。占先的粮元帅听到马蹄声，他勒马回头也表示着高兴：“欢迎呵，钢同志，衷心欢迎！让我们一道再跃马并进！”钢元帅你回答得十分坚定：“应该感谢党所领导的人民，一马当先还得要万马奔腾，党要我们跑多快，就得听命。”“对！”粮元帅也扎实地赞成，“党要我们跑多快，就得听命！我们的马力是十分充沛的呵，不仅能够多快，还得追求好省。”“我们也还要有全局观点才行，”钢元帅你又补充了你的议论，“我们总得为全体人民服务，需要量还须得按照着可能。”“对！党的领导一切都正确英明，群众路线是奔腾万马的缰绳。咱们俩已勘出建设进军的途径，正好按照着部署，有节奏地进军。”四处的凯歌声正高唱入云，打断了两位元帅的一答一问。胜利的红旗在全中国招展，各个建设战线上跃进着群英。1959年转瞬就要来临，他要带来第十次的庄严国庆。各个岗位都在准备着奉献礼品，实事求是地，力争上游，鼓足干劲。钢，铁定的1070万吨！今天知道了你已提前完成。大家都努力着要向你看齐，使1959年更比今年繁荣！
