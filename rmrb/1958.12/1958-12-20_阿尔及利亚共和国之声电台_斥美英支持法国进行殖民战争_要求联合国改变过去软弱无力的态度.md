Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 19th: The Radio Voice of the Republic of Algeria said in a commentary on the evening of the 18th that NATO countries, especially the United States and Britain, should immediately cease their direct and open support for French imperialism's continued war of colonial aggression in Algeria.

The radio station demanded that the United Nations change its past weak and powerless attitude, publicly condemn France's shameful practices, and condemn the egregious practices of NATO member states in supporting France.

The radio station said that the de Gaulle government, disregarding the wishes of the Algerian people and government, insisted on continuing the bloody war of aggression in Algeria, attempting to maintain the outdated colonial system. This shows that it completely disregards the world trend.

The radio station pointed out that de Gaulle dares to maintain this attitude because he has the support of Western countries, especially the member states of NATO.

The radio station said that these member states provided de Gaulle with various weapons and explosives, as well as large amounts of loans. When the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Afro-Asian countries' proposal on the peaceful settlement of the Algerian question, they voted against the proposal or abstained (which is equivalent to opposition).

The radio station said, however, that the Algerian people's heroic struggle for more than four years has demonstrated their determination to fight to the end. The Algerian liberation war is a war of the whole people. All the Algerian people fully support the heroic National Liberation Army, while the French army is isolated everywhere and beaten everywhere. An army that has the support of the whole people cannot be defeated.

The radio station pointed out that Algeria is not isolated in the world. The warm welcome of the delegations to the All-African People's Conference to the Algerian representatives shows that the entire Africa sympathizes with our just struggle. Two hundred million Africans support our heroic cause of armed struggle. Arab brother countries have taken a series of measures to stop the atrocities of the French colonial authorities in Algeria.

The radio station said that in Asia, the great People's Republic of China has recently reiterated its full and permanent support for the Algerian people's struggle. The radio station pointed out that this support is of great significance to the victory of the Algerian people's just cause.

    斥美英支持法国进行殖民战争
    要求联合国改变过去软弱无力的态度
    新华社开罗19日电  阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台18日晚上在评论中说，北大西洋公约组织各国，特别是美英两国，应该立即停止它们直接和公开支持法国帝国主义在阿尔及利亚继续进行侵略的殖民战争的做法。
    电台要求联合国改变它过去软弱无力的态度，公开指责法国的可耻作法，并且谴责各北大西洋公约组织成员国支持法国的恶劣作法。
    电台说，戴高乐政府不顾阿尔及利亚人民和政府的意愿，坚持在阿尔及利亚继续血腥的侵略战争，企图保持已经过时的殖民主义制度。这表明它完全无视世界潮流。
    电台指出，戴高乐之所以敢坚持抱这种态度，是因为他得到西方国家，特别是北大西洋公约组织各成员国的支持。
    电台说，这些成员国向戴高乐提供了各种武器和炸药，以及大量的贷款。它们在联合国大会讨论关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的亚非国家提案时，投票反对这个提案或弃权（这等于反对）。
    电台说，但是阿尔及利亚人民四年多以来的英勇斗争已经表明了他们斗争到底的决心。阿尔及利亚解放战争是全民的战争。全体阿尔及利亚人民都全力支持英勇的民族解放军，而法国军队却处处孤立，处处挨打。一支得到全民支持的军队是无法被击败的。
    电台指出，阿尔及利亚在世界上并不孤立。全非人民大会各代表团对阿尔及利亚代表的热烈欢迎，表明整个非洲都同情我们的正义斗争。两亿非洲人支持我们武装斗争的英雄事业。阿拉伯兄弟国家采取了一系列措施，以便制止法国殖民当局在阿尔及利亚的暴行。
    电台说，在亚洲，伟大的中华人民共和国最近又重申全力和永远支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。电台指出，这种支持对阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业的胜利有着重大的意义。
