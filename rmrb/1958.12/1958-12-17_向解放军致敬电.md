To Comrade Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, and all commanders and fighters of the heroic People's Liberation Army:

    We, the delegates attending the National Women's Conference of Socialist Construction Activists, with unparalleled excitement, extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to you on behalf of women of all ethnic groups across the country.
    You are the invincible heroic force led by the Party and Chairman Mao, the most loyal defenders of our country's socialist construction and world peace, the vanguard in puncturing the paper tiger of imperialism and all reactionaries. In peaceful times, you are also a powerful labor army actively participating in socialist construction. Your heroic and tenacious struggle protects our peaceful construction and safeguards the happy and beautiful lives of all our people and women and children. When we are engaged in intense labor and study, and when we see the rosy, chubby smiling faces of our children, we often think of your great achievements. Your great patriotism, internationalism, and fearless heroism educate and inspire us. We will always work with you to continue to exert our utmost efforts, aim high, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and strive to the end to build our country into a great socialist country and to realize the communist ideal in the future!
    Currently, the troops on the coastal defense front are severely punishing the enemy, tightening the noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism. Your heroic actions represent the will of our vast number of women and mothers. Your great achievements are not only of great significance for safeguarding our country's socialist construction, but also provide tremendous encouragement to all peace-loving and independence-seeking people in the world.
    The women of our country love peace, but we understand that only by resolutely resisting aggression can we maintain peace. We will never allow aggressors to run rampant. Our young and middle-aged women have all joined militia organizations, engaging in labor and production while training and practicing military skills. Our women across the country are determined to work with the people of the whole country to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, to defend the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, to achieve the complete unification of the motherland, and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.
