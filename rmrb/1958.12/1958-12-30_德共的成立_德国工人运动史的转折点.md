    The founding of the German Communist Party - A Turning Point in the History of the German Workers' Movement
    President of the German Democratic Republic Wilhelm Pieck

    The November Revolution in Germany in 1918 confirmed Lenin's theory that the working class can only achieve victory when the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class clearly leads the revolutionary forces of the people forward. The founding of the German Communist Party on December 30, 1918, was the inevitable result of the German workers' movement's left wing, based on its understanding of this theory, engaging in a resolute struggle against the opportunist and social-chauvinist policies of the Social Democratic leaders. The Social Democratic leaders betrayed the people in the struggle against militarism and war. The founding of the German Communist Party created the conditions for the reunification of the German working class on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The policies now adopted by the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic, aimed at safeguarding peace and ensuring the happiness of the working people, are a continuation of the heroic struggle of the best elements of the German working class forty years ago, when, through the powerful actions of the November Revolution, they ended the war, overthrew the monarchy, and dealt a severe blow to the imperialist system. Therefore, the working people of the German Democratic Republic, in the spirit of the German left's struggle to defend peace and to liberate all oppressed and exploited people from the yoke of imperialism, celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party.

    As capitalism entered the stage of imperialism, debates began within the German workers' movement regarding the correct political line. Revisionists were active in denying V.I. Lenin's thesis that during the decline of capitalism—the era of imperialism—the workers' movement must adopt new forms of class struggle to guide the masses in revolution and overthrow the rule of monopoly capital. The revolutionary left, formed under the leadership of Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin, sought to maintain the revolutionary nature of the German Social Democratic Party. However, revisionism undermined the unity of the workers' movement and disarmed it.

    At the outbreak of the First World War, the attitude of the Social Democratic parties in various countries immediately showed that parties influenced by reformism could not lead the masses to fight to defend peace and escape exploitation. Only the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Lenin and the left wing, fulfilled its obligations undertaken at the international socialist congresses and organized the people of all nationalities in Russia to wage the most resolute struggle against the imperialist war and Tsarist rule. Karl Liebknecht's glorious action followed this precedent. As the only person in the Reichstag to vote against military loans on December 2, Liebknecht sent a signal far beyond Germany, showing the ordinary people of all countries the firm determination of the best elements of the German working class to oppose the war with all their might.

    Thereafter, even the most brutal persecution, arrests, and imprisonment did not stop the growth of mass rallies, marches, demonstrations, and strikes against the continuation of the imperialist war. Under the influence of the February Revolution in Russia, the people who staged the April general strike and the August 1917 fleet mutiny against the war became increasingly determined to oppose the imperialist monarchy.

    The Great October Revolution, a turning point in human history, had a profound impact on the German people, exhausted by famine and economic hardship, and on the German soldiers bleeding under fire and on the battlefields. The October Revolution pointed out to them the way out of their worsening poverty and the path to peace. Strikes and resistance activities spread rapidly throughout Germany. First, there were large numbers of incidents of refusal to obey orders in the fleet.

    In 1918, Germany's revolutionary crisis matured, requiring decisive action in the German workers' movement. The left, under the leadership of Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, and myself, established an ideological center within the Spartacus League. The most determined forces of the German workers' movement participated in this center. In April 1917, many Social Democrats, due to the German Social Democratic Party leadership's policy of supporting the war, declared their withdrawal from the party. Under the leadership of some eclectic cadres who were still severely influenced by opportunism, they formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. The Spartacus League, against the urgent advice of its most conscious forces, did not establish its own party based on the experience of the Bolsheviks, but instead joined this party. This affected the efforts to consolidate revolutionary forces organizationally and win the majority of the German working class.

    The Spartacus League's selfless struggle against militarism and war wrote a glorious page in the history of the German workers' movement. Lenin wrote on October 18, 1918, "The work of the German Spartacists, who are conducting systematic revolutionary propaganda under the most difficult conditions, has truly saved the honor of German socialism and the German proletariat." The Spartacus League's slogans conformed to the interests of the working people, enabling large numbers of workers to see in the policies adopted by the Spartacus League the only way out of war, disaster, and poverty. Therefore, in the November Revolution of 1918, it became the most resolute and revolutionary leading force guiding the German working class and other working strata forward.

    In the November Revolution, the magnificent revolutionary tide shattered the rule of the monarchy, ended the war, and opened a huge gap in the imperialist system of rule. In a few short days, workers' and soldiers' committees were established almost everywhere in Germany, securing noteworthy bourgeois democratic freedoms and social reforms. However, the task of continuing the revolution with a clear objective and thoroughly smashing the reactionary state machine was hindered and ultimately prevented. The majority of revolutionary masses believed in the German Social Democratic Party leadership's soothing promises, believing that democracy had been achieved, socialism was coming, and everything else could be left to the National Assembly. Thus, the Spartacus League's struggle was greatly affected due to the lack of a strong backbone organization that could tightly organize the vast masses sympathetic to the revolution. The course of the revolution, the betrayal by the German Social Democratic Party leadership, the dispatch of Ebert and Noske's counter-revolutionary troops, the shameful attitude of the German Independent Social Democratic Party leadership, and the resurgence of restoration forces hindering the Spartacus League's activities, all increasingly urgently demanded the establishment of an independent revolutionary Marxist party.

    On December 30, 1918, delegates from the Spartacus League from all over Germany gathered in Berlin and decided to establish the German Communist Party. Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin, Franz Mehring, Leo Jogiches, and I were elected to the Central Committee. The founding of the German Communist Party was a major victory for the left's policies and a turning point in the history of the German workers' movement. Its organizational break with opportunism was a major step towards achieving unity in the German workers' movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The German Communist Party immediately stood on the side of the glorious Bolshevik Party and the young Soviet state, from which came Lenin's call for peace after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    The unwavering will to unite closely with the Soviet regime and to fight with all our might to liberate the working people from exploitation and oppression determined the policies of the German Communist Party. Therefore, from the very beginning, it was subjected to the most brutal persecution by the imperialist reactionary forces. A few days after its founding, the party's leaders, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, were murdered by counter-revolutionary officers of Noske's troops. I myself was arrested and narrowly escaped the same fate. A few weeks later, Leo Jogiches was also murdered, and Franz Mehring died under the influence of terror and persecution. Following these martyrs, thousands upon thousands of heroes of our party were brutally murdered in Nazi concentration camps in the struggle to organize opposition to Hitler's war policies and his ambitious plans to dominate the world.

    The period from 1918 to 1933 was a period of continuous growth for the German Communist Party. The party resolutely defended the rights of the working people and waged an uncompromising struggle against the reactionaries. This required the party to make great sacrifices, but it also gained the party enormous influence among the German working people, making the German imperialists regard the German Communist Party as the most dangerous threat to their rule. In January 1933, the monopoly capitalists helped the fascists seize power through a coup.

    The Nazis immediately began by suppressing the Communists first, and tens of thousands of Communists were imprisoned in concentration camps. Countless martyrs were murdered shortly before liberation after years of imprisonment. Among them was also the chairman of the German Communist Party, our unforgettable Ernst Thälmann. From 1933 onwards, Thälmann was transferred to many prisons, and finally, on August 16, 1944, he was murdered by SS bandits in the Buchenwald concentration camp.

    However, even in the most difficult years of Nazi terror, the German Communists never ceased their struggle. They were forced to go into the most secret underground state, carrying out the struggle against the German imperialists' preparation for the Second World War to the very last day. As the fascist war machine attacked one country after another, carrying out wanton destruction and sending people to Germany to engage in forced labor, the resistance it encountered also grew stronger, and the international solidarity of underground fighters against war and fascism also became more consolidated. The heroic deeds of the German Communists, together with anti-fascists and resistance fighters from many countries, once again saved the honor of the German working class, and at the same time created the preliminary conditions for friendly cooperation between a new democratic Germany and other peoples. Today, the fraternal friendship between the German Democratic Republic and many countries that were once occupied by the fascists is also based on the common struggle against German imperialism.

    The merger of the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party in the German democratic zone on April 21, 1946, to form the German Socialist Unity Party, and the subsequent establishment of the German Democratic Republic, were the glorious results of decades of struggle by the German Communist Party for the unity of the German working class and the establishment of a peaceful and democratic country. The division of the German working class, which in the past only benefited the reactionaries and made fascist rule possible, was eliminated. The unification of the working class on the basis of Marxism-Leninism is a decisive prerequisite for building a peace-loving and democratic Germany and the most reliable guarantee that imperialist troops will never again attack the peoples of our neighboring countries from this part of Germany.

    The working people of the German Democratic Republic have eradicated imperialism, militarism, and fascism in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. They have established a new socialist social system and are achieving new successes in socialist construction every year. They are joyfully implementing the plans formulated by the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, aiming to surpass West Germany in the per capita consumption of all important food and consumer goods by 1961. The German Democratic Republic has been able to provide valuable economic assistance to West German workers suffering from the crisis. The German Democratic Republic has developed into a strong fortress of peace, understanding among peoples, and the ever-improving welfare of all working people. It has become a model for a reunited Germany.

    The government of the German Democratic Republic has put forward a realistic program for the reunification of Germany through negotiations, the formation of a confederation of the two German states, and the preparation of a peace treaty. This policy of peace, as well as the great political, economic, social, and cultural achievements of the first German worker-peasant state, has had an increasing impact on the people of West Germany. In western Germany, the voices against Adenauer's atomic war policy, against the growing economic crisis, and against the ever-increasing fascistization of the Bonn state machine have become increasingly loud. The Adenauer clique is attempting to suppress the people's growing resistance with terror and emergency laws, by banning all progressive organizations and eliminating the remnants of democratic freedoms. This resistance has already extended to the ranks of the ruling party. The people of West Germany are increasingly aware that the regime of German imperialism—the fascist system—is leading West Germany towards disaster, crisis, and war.

    The working people of the German Democratic Republic have realized the will of the founders of the German Communist Party and are building socialism. As they celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party, they are deeply convinced that their government's unwavering policy of peace shows the peoples of all countries that peace comes from the German Democratic Republic.

    德共的成立——德国工人运动史的转折点
    德意志民主共和国总统  威廉·皮克
    1918年德国的十一月革命，证实了列宁的这一学说：只有当工人阶级的马克思列宁主义政党目标明确地领导人民的革命力量前进的时候，工人阶级才能取得胜利。1918年12月30日德国共产党的成立，就是德国工人运动中的左派根据对这一学说的认识，同社会民主党领袖的机会主义和社会沙文主义政策进行坚决斗争的必然结果。社会民主党领袖在反对军国主义和战争的斗争中背叛了人民。德国共产党的成立，为德国工人阶级在马克思列宁主义基础上重新统一创造了条件。现在德国统一社会党中央委员会和德意志民主共和国政府所采取的旨在维护和平和使劳动人民幸福的政策，是四十年前德国工人阶级优秀分子的英勇斗争的继续，那时，他们通过十一月革命的有力行动结束了战争，推翻了君主政体，并给帝国主义体系以严重打击。因此，德意志民主共和国劳动人民本着德国左派为保卫和平、为把所有被压迫被剥削的人民从帝国主义桎梏下解放出来而斗争的精神，来庆祝德国共产党成立四十周年。
    随着资本主义进入帝国主义阶段，在德国工人运动中开始了关于正确的政治路线的争论。修正主义者曾大肆活动，否定乌·伊·列宁关于在资本主义衰亡时期——帝国主义时期——工人运动必须采用新的阶级斗争形式，来引导群众进行革命，推翻垄断资本的统治的论点。在罗莎·卢森堡和克拉拉·蔡特金的领导下形成的革命左派，力图保持德国社会民主党的革命性质。但是修正主义瓦解了工人运动的统一，解除了它的武装。
    第一次世界大战爆发时，各国社会民主党的态度立即表明了，受改良主义影响的各党不能领导群众为保卫和平和摆脱剥削而斗争。只有以列宁为首的左派占领导地位的俄国社会民主工党，实现了在国际社会党代表大会上承担的义务，组织了俄国各族人民向帝国主义战争和沙皇统治进行最坚决的斗争。卡尔·李卜克内西的光荣行动，是追随了这一先例的。李卜克内西是12月2日在国会中唯一投票反对军事公债的人，他就发出了远远超出德国之外的信号，向各国普通人民表明了德国工人阶级优秀分子全力反对战争的坚定决心。
    此后，即使是最残酷的迫害、逮捕和监禁，也没有阻止住反对继续帝国主义战争的群众大会、游行示威和罢工的增长。在俄国二月革命的影响下，举行四月大罢工和1917年8月的舰队起义反战活动的人们，愈来愈坚决地反对帝国主义君主政体。
    十月革命这一人类历史的伟大转折点，对德国国内因饥荒和经济困难而筋疲力尽的人民，对在炮火下和在战场上流血的德国士兵，都发生了深刻的影响。十月革命向他们指出了摆脱日益恶化的贫困处境的出路，指出了和平的道路。罢工和反抗活动在整个德国迅速地开展起来。首先是在舰队中发生了大批拒绝执行命令的事件。
    1918年德国的革命危机渐趋成熟，它要求在德国工人运动中采取坚决的行动。左派在卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、弗朗茨·梅林、克拉拉·蔡特金和我的领导下，在斯巴达克联盟内建立了一个思想中心。参加这个中心的是德国工人运动的最坚定的力量。1917年4月，许多社会民主党人由于德国社会民主党领导赞成战争的政策而宣告退党，他们在一些还受着机会主义严重影响的折衷主义派干部的领导下，成立了德国独立社会民主党。斯巴达克联盟没有接受它的最有觉悟的力量的迫切忠告，没有建立一个以布尔什维克的经验为基础的自己的政党，却随着参加了这个政党。这样就影响了革命力量在组织上巩固地团结起来和争取德国工人阶级的多数的努力。
    斯巴达克联盟反对军国主义和战争的前仆后继的忘我斗争，在德国工人运动史上写下了光荣的一页。列宁曾于1918年10月18日写道，“在最艰苦的情况下进行系统革命宣传的德国斯巴达克派的工作，真正挽救了德国社会主义和德国无产阶级的光荣。”斯巴达克联盟的口号符合劳动人民的利益，使大批工人群众在斯巴达克联盟所采取的方针中看到了摆脱战争、灾难和贫困的唯一出路，因此它在1918年的11月革命中，就成为引导德国工人阶级和其他劳动阶层前进的最坚决最革命的领导力量。
  在十一月革命中，波澜壮阔的革命浪潮粉碎了君主统治，结束了战争，在帝国主义统治体系中打开了巨大的缺口。在短短几天之内，德国各地几乎都成立了工人士兵委员会，争取到值得重视的资产阶级民主自由和社会改革。但是，目标明确地把革命继续下去，彻底粉碎反动的国家机器的工作，却受到了妨碍，最后并受到阻止。大部分革命群众相信德国社会民主党领导的笼络人心的保证，认为民主已经实现，社会主义正在来到，其他一切都可以让国民议会去办。这样，由于缺乏一个能把同情革命的广大群众严密地组织起来的坚强的骨干机构，斯巴达克联盟的斗争受到了很大的影响。革命的经过、德国社会民主党领导的叛变、艾伯特和诺斯克反革命军队的调遣、德国独立社会民主党领导的可耻态度、重又抬头的复辟势力阻挠斯巴达克联盟的活动，这一切都越来越迫切地要求成立一个独立的革命的马克思主义政党。
    1918年12月30日，来自德国各地的斯巴达克联盟代表在柏林聚会，决定成立德国共产党。被选入中央委员会的有卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、克拉拉·蔡特金、弗朗茨·梅林、列奥·约吉歇斯和我。德国共产党的成立，是左派政策的重大胜利和德国工人运动史的转折点。它在组织上同机会主义实行决裂，是德国工人运动在马克思列宁主义基础上取得统一的一个重大步骤。德国共产党立即站在光荣的布尔什维克党和年青的苏维埃国家的一边，在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后从这个国家里传来了列宁的和平呼声。
    同苏维埃政权紧密团结在一起，尽一切力量为把劳动人民从剥削和压迫下解放出来而斗争的不可动摇的意志，决定了德国共产党的政策。因此，从一开始起，它就受到帝国主义反动势力的最残酷的迫害。在它成立几天之后，党的领袖卡尔·李卜克内西和罗莎·卢森堡就被诺斯克军队的反革命军官杀害了。我自己也被逮捕，差一点遭到同样的命运。几星期后，列奥·约吉歇斯也被杀害，弗朗茨·梅林在恐怖和迫害的影响下去世。继这些死难者之后，我们党又有成千上万的英雄，在组织反对希特勒战争政策及其统治世界的狂妄计划的斗争中，在纳粹集中营里，遭到野蛮的杀害。
    1918年至1933年是德国共产党不断壮大的时期。党坚决地维护劳动人民的权利，并同反动派进行毫不妥协的斗争。这一方面要求党作出重大牺牲，另一方面使党在德国劳动人民中获得了巨大的影响，使得德国帝国主义者把德国共产党看作是对他们的统治的最危险的威胁。1933年1月，垄断资本家帮助法西斯分子通过政变攫取了政权。
    纳粹分子立即开始首先镇压共产党人，成千上万的共产党人被关进了集中营。无数烈士是经过多年囚禁之后在解放前不久被害的。在他们中间，也有德国共产党的主席、我们难忘的恩斯特·台尔曼。从1933年起，台尔曼曾被转送过许多监狱，终于1944年8月16日在布痕瓦尔德集中营被党卫军匪徒杀害了。
    但是，即使在最艰难的纳粹恐怖年代里，德国共产党人也没有停止过斗争。他们被迫转入最秘密的地下状态，把反对德国帝国主义者准备第二次世界大战的斗争，进行到最后一天。随着法西斯战争机器进攻一个又一个国家，大肆进行破坏，并把人们押送到德国来从事强迫劳动，它所遇到的反抗也日益增强，反对战争和法西斯主义的地下战士的国际团结，也日益巩固。德国共产党人同来自许多国家的反法西斯者和抵抗战士一起作出的英雄事迹，再一次挽救了德国工人阶级的荣誉，同时并为一个新的民主德国同别国人民的友好合作创造了初步条件。今天德意志民主共和国同许多曾被法西斯占领的国家之间的兄弟般友谊，也是基于反对德国帝国主义的共同斗争的。
    1946年4月21日德国共产党和德国社会民主党在德国民主区合并成为德国统一社会党，后来德意志民主共和国成立，这都是德国共产党几十年来为德国工人阶级统一和建立一个和平民主的国家而斗争的光辉结果。过去只是有利于反动派并使法西斯统治成为可能的德国工人阶级的分裂状态消除了。工人阶级在马克思列宁主义基础上的联合，是建设一个爱好和平的和民主的德国的决定性前提，是永远不会再有帝国主义军队从德国这一部分去进攻我们邻国人民的最可靠的保证。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民按照波茨坦协定根除了帝国主义、军国主义和法西斯主义。他们建立了新的社会主义社会制度，在社会主义建设中每年都取得新的成就。他们正在欢欣鼓舞地实现德国统一社会党第五次代表大会制订的计划，到1961年时要使所有重要食品和消费品的消费量按人口计算超过西德。德意志民主共和国已能向遭受危机打击的西德工人提供宝贵的经济援助。德意志民主共和国已经发展成为和平、各国人民谅解和全体劳动人民福利蒸蒸日上的坚强堡垒。它已成为一个重新统一的德国的榜样。
    德意志民主共和国政府提出了通过谈判、两个德国成立邦联和准备和约来重新统一德国的现实纲领。这种和平政策，以及第一个德意志工农国家的伟大的政治、经济、社会和文化成果，对西德人民发生了愈来愈大的影响。在德国西部，反对阿登纳的原子战争政策、反对日益发展的经济危机和反对波恩国家机器不断法西斯化的呼声，已经越来越响亮了。阿登纳集团企图用恐怖手段和紧急状态法，用禁止一切进步组织和消灭残余的民主自由等办法，来压制人民日益增强的反抗。这种反抗已经延伸到执政党的队伍中去。西德人民日益清楚地认识到，德国帝国主义的政权——法西斯制度把西德导向灾难、危机和战争。
    德意志民主共和国劳动人民已经实现了德国共产党创始人的遗嘱，正在建设社会主义。他们在庆祝德国共产党成立四十周年时深信，他们政府的坚持不渝的和平政策，向各国人民表明和平来自德意志民主共和国。（附图片）
