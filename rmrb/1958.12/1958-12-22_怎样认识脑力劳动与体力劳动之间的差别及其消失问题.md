How to Understand the Difference Between Mental and Manual Labor and its Disappearance
    Liu Zhikai
    Under the socialist system, the nature of the difference between mental and manual labor is fundamentally different compared to the capitalist system.
    The opposition between mental and manual labor emerged in the early stages of the development of class society, and became increasingly serious. In capitalist society, this opposition became even more acute and profound. Throughout class society, there is an unequal relationship between mental laborers and manual laborers: that of ruler and ruled. To eliminate this unequal social division of labor, it is necessary to carry out a proletarian revolution and overthrow the last exploitative system of mankind—capitalism.
    The difference between mental and manual labor, left over from the old system, cannot disappear with the elimination of the capitalist system, so this difference is inevitable in the socialist stage. However, its nature is fundamentally different from that under the capitalist system. Under the socialist system, due to the elimination of the system of exploitation of man by man and the establishment of a comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation based on socialist ownership, equality has been realized between people compared with the capitalist system. Therefore, although there is a difference between mental and manual labor, generally speaking, this is a contradiction based on the fundamental unity of the interests of the people, which is non-antagonistic. (However, if the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals do not accept the Party's policy of unity, criticism, and education, and refuse to transform themselves into ordinary laborers, then the contradiction will become antagonistic.) Moreover, this contradiction is transforming towards its opposite. The Party's great call for the intellectualization of workers and peasants and the worker-peasantization of intellectuals is a huge impetus for promoting their mutual transformation. The upsurge of intellectuals going to the mountains and the countryside, and workers and peasants studying science and culture, is the concrete practice of this mutual transformation. This is the essence of the difference between mental and manual labor under the socialist system.
      The elimination of classes does not
  mean the elimination of the difference
  between mental and manual labor, and
  therefore the factual inequality between
  them still exists.
    Wei Gao proposed that "the reason for the inequality between mental and manual labor is class, not the labor itself." Therefore, in his view, as long as classes are eliminated, even if there is a difference between mental and manual labor that represents the remnants of class, it will be "equal," and from this he concludes that this difference will "always exist." We believe this statement is wrong. It is true that the reason for the difference between mental and manual labor and the resulting inequality is class. However, overthrowing the exploiting classes does not mean eliminating the difference between them, and therefore it does not mean realizing equality between them in fact. This inequality can only be seen from a communist point of view; otherwise, at least in terms of thinking methods, we will commit a metaphysical error—treating inequality as equality or equality as inequality—which affects our efforts to eliminate the differences between them. Therefore, it is necessary to point out where this inequality lies. From the current point of view, we believe that this inevitable inequality is mainly manifested in: First, the difference between mental and manual labor, as a whole, is still very large. Scientific and cultural knowledge is still privately owned by a few people, and production has not yet been greatly developed. This greatly limits the ability of manual laborers to quickly transition from the long-term state of ignorance caused by the old society to the future of comprehensive cultivation and full development of talents. Therefore, they cannot fundamentally get rid of the factual pain of being fixed in one occupation for life, and they cannot freely choose multiple labors, especially mental labor, according to social needs and personal interests. The existence of this situation cannot but be a factual inequality for manual laborers. Even for mental laborers with a high degree of communist consciousness and moral character, because they are mainly engaged in relatively simple mental labor (which cannot be completely changed at present) and cannot participate in multiple labors, especially manual labor, they will also feel factual pain. Second, due to the existence of differences, the material products needed by mental laborers are basically provided by manual laborers, which relatively increases their labor burden (of course, it is not possible to do without the labor of those who are not purely engaged in mental labor at present). Third, due to the existence of inevitable bourgeois legal remnants in the distribution system in the socialist stage, it is necessary to maintain a higher (but not too disparate) scale of distribution of personal consumer goods for intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, than for general manual laborers, which is in fact unreasonable. It is obviously impossible to bring these things into communist society. Therefore, Lenin said: "In communist society, when the opposition between mental and manual labor has disappeared, and therefore one of the most important sources of modern social inequality has disappeared, and this source cannot be eliminated immediately by relying solely on the transfer of means of production to public ownership, or by expropriating the capitalists."①
      The correct attitude towards the
  difference between mental and manual
  labor should be: to see both the
  inevitability of its existence and the
  inevitability of its disappearance.
    At present, how should we treat the difference between mental and manual labor? We believe that the correct attitude should be: on the one hand, we must see the irrationality and inequality of this difference, and that it will inevitably be eliminated in the end; on the other hand, we must also see that the existence of this difference is inevitable, and its disappearance still requires a considerable transition period. Lenin said: "...to further eliminate the division of labor among people, and to educate, train and cultivate people with comprehensive knowledge and comprehensive training, that is, people who are able to do all things, communism is moving in this direction, it must move in this direction, and it will definitely reach this goal, but it will take many years."② This means that our task is to take active and practical measures to strive to accelerate the elimination of "the division of labor among people." The great call of our Party for intellectuals to go to the mountains and the countryside, the decision of cadres to participate in manual labor, the policy of education serving proletarian politics, the combination of education and labor production, and the major measures to popularize education among workers and peasants are all to achieve this goal, so as to finally eliminate this difference. However, Wei Gao defends the maintenance of this difference. He said: "Now people think that the division of labor between mental and manual labor is unreasonable, but we feel that this view is caused by the bourgeois thinking of belittling manual labor." But we say: Thinking that the division of labor between mental and manual labor is unreasonable is precisely the view that communists should have, and those who maintain the existence of this division are precisely due to bourgeois thinking. Because in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, it is "reasonable" for workers to sell their labor, work hard by the machines all day long to create surplus value for the capitalists, and then be paid in the form of wages according to (or even lower than) the value of labor, while they live a carefree life without working. Therefore, the bourgeoisie and their scholars have fabricated countless "theories" to cover up this unreasonable social division of labor, to resist the working class revolution and hinder social development. If their hypocritical "theories" have long been thoroughly shattered in theory by Marx, then they have also been thoroughly shattered in practice by the revolutionary actions of the working class. And further shattered by the current revolutionary and productive struggle practice in our country. It can be said that since the Great Leap Forward, it has been an era of unprecedented development of production practice and scientific and cultural undertakings in our country. In this era, due to the fact that the broad masses have begun to engage in mental labor, and due to the fact that intellectuals have linked theoretical study with production practice, amazing miracles have constantly appeared. Have you heard of a yield of more than 100,000 catties of rice per mu? No, but it has appeared on the agricultural front in our country. Has there ever been a worker's production efficiency increasing by thousands of times in history? No, but it has appeared on the industrial front in our country. Has there ever been such talented scientists who can write more than 2,000 papers that are both summaries of production experience and have scientific level in half a month by two factories? No, but it has appeared among ordinary workers in our country. In less than a month, a township created 143,400 poems, "The whole country sings for a bumper year, the granary is full of grain and the roof is broken, the working people stand on the roof of the granary, and only see the stars and the moon below." What a poem with such a great imagination! Did Li Bai have such great wisdom? No, but it was produced among ordinary farmers in our country. Schools manufacture airplanes, automobiles, accelerators, and electronic computers, and some have reached or even surpassed international standards, thereby greatly improving and developing theory. Has this ever happened in the history of education? No, but it has appeared among college students in our country.
    Logically speaking, even stubborn stones must nod in the face of such eloquent facts. However, until now, various strange and absurd arguments that maintain the existence of this difference have not disappeared. When the Party proposed that intellectuals go to the mountains and the countryside, they said it was "overqualified." When the Party proposed that education serve proletarian politics and the policy of combining education with labor production, they said that it would "affect the quality of teaching and research." There is also the formula designed by Wei Gao to "cultivate" talents: "It is not necessarily an ordinary laborer who combines manual and mental labor." Removing the phenomena and extracting the essence, we can easily see—as Engels said:
  "You know, the final reason for defending class differences is always saying: there must be a class that does not need to be tired of making a living every day and has time to engage in spiritual labor for society."③ Who thinks this division of labor is reasonable? Who belittles manual labor and manual laborers? Isn't the question very clear?
  Communist society wants to eliminate the
  difference between mental and manual
  labor, and therefore the factual
  equality between them can only be
  realized at that time.
    In communist society, will the difference still exist, as Wei Gao said, but "because knowledge belongs to everyone, plus the improvement of political thought, there will be no inequality"? The answer is no. We believe that, first of all, the difference and the resulting inequality are objectively existing and will never disappear simply by improving people's political thought; secondly, knowledge belongs to everyone, but is not owned by everyone (because Wei Gao advocates the existence of differences), which, in addition to being nonsense, can never achieve equality between them. Therefore, what Wei Gao said is not the "communist" society we idealize. What we idealize is the communist society that finally eliminates this difference.
    We can have a well-founded assumption that in communist society, with the great development of social production, the popularization and improvement of cultural education, everyone will have a high degree of scientific and cultural knowledge, and will be able to learn to organize and manage production and be familiar with the entire production process. Therefore, at that time, everyone will be an intellectual and also an ordinary laborer. Only when society develops to such a height can the era of private ownership of knowledge by a few people be completely declared over, and can people completely get rid of the pain of being bound to one occupation for life. Only at this time can mental and manual labor be unified in one person, and of course, the difference between mental and manual labor will naturally disappear. The material production on which people depend for survival can be "equally distributed among all working members of society" (Marx's words), and labor will no longer be transferred to others to bear. Thus, the factual equality between mental and manual labor will become a reality.
      The ultimate goal of eliminating the
  difference between mental and manual
  labor is to completely liberate
  the productive forces and build a communist
  society.
    Is the elimination of the difference between mental and manual labor only to achieve equality between them? No. We only need to look at how amazing the waste of productive forces is caused by the existence of this difference, and how it restricts social development, to see it at a glance. Therefore, its ultimate goal is to completely liberate the productive forces, highly develop social production, greatly increase social products, and fully meet the needs of all members of society, that is, to finally build a communist society.
    From the above, we can foresee the beautiful picture of future communist society. At that time, the current mental laborers and manual laborers will all become comprehensively developed people. Everyone will be able to engage in multi-faceted manual labor and multi-faceted mental labor, which can most comprehensively and reasonably utilize labor. Moreover, everyone will have a high degree of talent and wisdom. Therefore, the level of social productivity at that time must be improved to an unimaginable multiple compared to now. Due to the high development of productive forces, scientific and cultural undertakings must also be greatly developed, making people's talents even more increased, and in turn, it will definitely promote greater development of productive forces on the original basis. With the growth of people's new and higher needs, society will produce newer and more products to meet the new needs of all members of society. This cycle continues endlessly. What a beautiful society! The realization of such a society—communist society—in our country is not a distant future.

    怎样认识脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别及其消失问题 
    刘志开
    社会主义制度下，脑力
  劳动与体力劳动间差别的性
  质，与资本主义制度比较起
  来，有着根本上的不同
    脑力劳动与体力劳动间的对立，在阶级社会发展的早期阶段就已经产生，而且愈来愈严重，到了资本主义社会，这种对立更加尖锐化、深刻化起来。在整个阶级社会中脑力劳动者与体力劳动者之间是统治与被统治的不平等关系。要消灭这种不平等的社会分工，只有进行无产阶级革命，推翻人类最后的一个剥削制度——资本主义制度。
    由于旧制度遗留下的脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别，不可能随着资本主义制度的被消灭而消失，所以这种差别在社会主义阶段是不可避免的。但是，它与资本主义制度下的性质，却有着根本上的不同。在社会主义制度下，由于消灭了人剥削人的制度，建立了以社会主义所有制为基础的同志式的互助合作的关系，所以与资本主义制度下相比，人与人之间已经实现了平等。因而，脑力劳动与体力劳动之间虽然存在着差别，但一般说来这是在人民利益根本一致基础上的矛盾，具有非对抗性质（但是资产阶级及其知识分子，如果不接受党的团结、批评、教育的政策，拒绝改造自己成为普通劳动者，那末矛盾就会变成对抗性的），并且这种矛盾正在向着各自的反面转化。党提出的知识分子工农化，工农群众知识化的伟大号召，就是推动它们互相转化的巨大动力，知识分子上山下乡，工农群众学习科学、文化的高潮，就是这种互相转化的具体实践。这就是社会主义制度下，脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别的实质所在。
      阶级消灭了，并不等于
  消灭了脑力劳动与体力劳动
  间的差别，因而他们之间事
  实上的不平等依然存在
    魏高提出“造成脑力劳动与体力劳动不平等的原因是阶级，而不是其本身。”因此，在他看来，只要阶级消灭了，尽管存在表现阶级残余的脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别，也会是“平等”的，并由此得出结论说，这种差别将“永远存在”。我们认为这种说法是错误的。诚然，造成脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别及由此产生的不平等的原因是阶级；但是推翻了剥削阶级，并不等于消灭了他们之间的差别，因而也就不等于实现了他们之间在事实上的平等。这个不平等只能用共产主义的观点才会看得出来；否则，至少在思想方法上要犯——把不平等当作平等或者把平等当作不平等——形而上学的错误，影响着我们对于消灭它们之间差别的努力。因此，指出这种不平等的所在是有必要的。从目前看，我们认为这种不可避免的不平等主要表现在：第一，脑力劳动与体力劳动间，就其全体来说还有很大的差别，科学文化知识仍为少数人所私有，加以生产还没有极大地发展，这就使得体力劳动者，由旧社会长期造成的愚昧状态尽快地过渡到全面培养和全面发挥才智的未来，受到了很大的限制。因而他们还不可能从根本上摆脱终身固定在一个职业里的事实上的痛苦，还不可能根据社会需要及个人的兴趣，自由选择多种劳动，特别是脑力劳动。这种状况的存在，对体力劳动者来说，不能不是在事实上的不平等；即使在有高度共产主义觉悟和道德品质的脑力劳动者来说，由于主要是从事比较单纯的脑力劳动（在当前还不可能完全改变），而不能参加多种劳动，特别是体力劳动，也会感到事实上的痛苦。第二，由于差别的存在，脑力劳动者所需的物质生活的产品，基本上还是由体力劳动者提供的，这就相对加大了他们的劳动负担
  （当然，当前没有比较单纯的脑力劳动者的劳动也是不行的）。第三，由于在社会主义阶段，不可避免的资产阶级式的法权残余在分配制度上的存在，所以在个人消费品的分配上，不能不保持知识分子特别是高级知识分子高于（但不能太悬殊）一般体力劳动者的尺度，这在事实上是不合理的。把这些东西带到共产主义社会里去，显然是不可能的。因此，列宁说：“到共产主义社会，那时脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立已经消失，因而现代社会不平等的最重要的根源之一也就消失，而这个根源光靠生产资料转为公有财产，光靠剥夺资本家，是决不能立刻消除的。”①
      对待脑力劳动与体力劳
  动之间差别的正确态度应该
  是：既要看到其存在的不可
  避免性，又要看到其消失的
  必然性
    在目前，怎样对待脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别呢？我们认为正确的态度应该是：一方面必须看到这种差别存在的不合理、不平等，最后必然消灭它；另一方面也必须看到这种差别存在是不可避免的，它的消失还须要经过相当长的过渡阶段。列宁说：“……进而消灭人与人中间的分工，以及教育、训练和培养出具有全面知识的、受有全面训练的人，即能够作所有一切事情的人，共产主义正是向这个方向走去，它必须向这个方向走去，并且定能到达这个目的，不过须要经过许多年份。”②这就是说，我们的任务在于：采取积极切实的措施，为着加速消灭“人与人之间的分工”而努力。我们党提出的知识分子上山下乡的伟大号召，干部参加体力劳动的决定，教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与劳动生产结合的方针，以及向工农劳动群众普及教育的重大措施，都是为了达到这个目的，以便最后消灭这种差别。然而魏高却为保持这种差别进行辩护。他说：“现在人们认为脑力、体力劳动的分工不合理，我们却觉得这种看法是轻视体力劳动的资产阶级思想引起的。”而我们却说：认为脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工不合理，这正是共产主义者所应有的观点，而维护这种分工存在的人，才正是由于资产阶级思想所引起的。因为在资产阶级看来，工人出卖劳动力，整日为资本家创造剩余价值苦劳于机器旁，然后按照（甚至低于）劳动力价值，以工资形式支付给工人，而他们却过着逍遥自在不劳而获的生活是“合理”的。所以资产阶级及其学者们，不知捏造了多少“理论”来掩盖这种不合理的社会分工，用以抵制工人阶级革命，阻碍社会的发展。如果说他们的虚伪
  “理论”早已被马克思从理论上彻底粉碎了，那末也早已被工人阶级的革命行动从实践上彻底粉碎了。并且进一步为我国的当前革命和生产斗争实践所粉碎。可以这样说，大跃进以来，是我国生产实践和科学文化事业空前发展的时代，在这个时代里，由于广大群众开始从事脑力劳动，由于知识分子把理论学习和生产实践联系起来，不断出现了惊人的奇迹，亩产十多万斤水稻，听说过吗？没有，可是在我国的农业战线上出现了；一个工人的生产效率成千倍的增长，历史上有过吗？没有，可是在我国的工业战线上出现了；两个工厂半个月就写出两千多篇既是生产经验总结，又有科学水平的论文，有过这样才高的科学家吗？没有，可是在我国的普通工人中出现了；一个乡不到一个月，就创造诗歌十四万三千四百首，“全国歌唱丰收年，满仓粮食顶破天，劳动人民仓顶站，只见星月在下边”，这是富有多么伟大幻想的诗篇，太白有这样大的智慧吗？没有，可是在我国的普通农民中产生了。学校制造飞机、汽车、加速器、电子计算机，并且有的已经达到甚至超过了国际水平，从而并极大地提高和发展了理论，这在教育史上有过吗？没有，可是在我国的大学生中出现了。
    按理说，在如此雄辩的事实面前，即使顽石也得点头了。但是，直到现在维护这种差别存在的各种各样的奇谈怪论，并没有绝迹。党提出知识分子上山下乡，他们说这是“大材小用”。党提出教育为无产阶级的政治服务；教育与劳动生产结合的方针，他们说“要影响教学与研究质量”；还有魏高设计的
  “培养”人材的公式：“不一定是体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的普通劳动者。”如此等等。去其现象，抽其本质，我们便不难看出——正如恩格斯所说的：
  “要知道，辩护阶级差别的最后理由总是说：一定要有一个阶级无须每日疲劳于图谋生计而有暇为社会从事精神劳动”。③谁认为这种分工合理？谁轻视体力劳动及体力劳动者？问题不是很清楚吗？
  共产主义社会要消灭脑
  力劳动与体力劳动间的差
  别，因而他们之间事实上的
  平等，只有到那个时候才能
  实现
    到共产主义社会，是否像魏高所说的：差别依然存在，只是“由于知识是大家的，加上政治思想的提高，所以就不会出现不平等”呢？回答是否定的。我们认为，首先，差别及由此产生的不平等，是客观存在的，绝不会光靠人们的政治思想提高而消失；其次，知识是大家的，但不归大家所有（因魏高主张存有差别），这除了是一句废话以外，绝不能实现他们之间的平等。因此，魏高所说的并不是我们所理想的“共产主义”社会，我们所理想的是最后消灭这种差别的共产主义社会。
    我们可以有根据的设想，到了共产主义社会，随着社会生产的极大发展，文化教育的普及和提高，每一个人都具有高度的科学文化知识，都能学会组织管理生产和熟悉整个生产过程，因而那时人人都是知识分子，同时又都是普通劳动者。只有社会发展到这样的高度，知识为少数人私有的时代才能宣告彻底结束，人们终身束缚在一个职业里的痛苦才能彻底摆脱。只有这时，脑力劳动与体力劳动才能在一个人身上统一起来，当然，脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别也就自然消亡了。人们生存所依赖的物质生产，才能“均等地分配于社会一切有工作能力的成员间”（马克思语），劳动不再转嫁给别人负担。从而脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的事实上的平等才成为现实。
      消灭脑力劳动与体力劳
  动间的差别，最终目的是：
  彻底解放生产力，建成共产
  主义社会
    消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动间的差别，是否只是为了实现他们之间的平等呢？不是的。我们只要看看由于这种差别的存在，造成生产力多么惊人的浪费，如何限制着社会的发展，便可一目了然。因此，它的最终目的是：彻底解放生产力，高度发展社会生产，极大的增加社会产品，充分地满足全社会成员的需要，即最后建成共产主义社会。
    从上所述，我们可以预想到未来共产主义社会的美好图景。到那个时候，现在的脑力劳动者和体力劳动者，都变成了全面发展的人，每一个人既能从事多方面的体力劳动，又能从事多方面的脑力劳动，这就能够最全面和最合理的利用劳动力；加以那时候，每一个人又都具有高度的才能和智慧，因而那时的社会生产力水平一定要比现在提高到难以设想的倍数，由于生产力的高度发展，科学文化事业又必随之极大地发展，使人们的才智又会更加增长，反转过来定又促进生产力在原有基础上的更大发展，随着人们新的更高的需要的增长，社会将又生产出更新更多的产品，以满足全体社会成员的新的需要。如此循环不已。这是多么美好的社会！这样的社会——共产主义社会在我国的实现已非遥远的未来了。
