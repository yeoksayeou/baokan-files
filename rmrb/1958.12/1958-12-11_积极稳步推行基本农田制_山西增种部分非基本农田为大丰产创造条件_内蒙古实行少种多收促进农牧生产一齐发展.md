Actively and Steadily Promote the Basic Farmland System
Shanxi Increases Planting of Some Non-Basic Farmland to Create Conditions for a Bumper Harvest
Inner Mongolia Implements Less Planting and More Harvesting to Promote Simultaneous Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
(Our Newspaper News) Reporter Yang Yi reports: In Shanxi Province, in promoting the "Basic Farmland" system, in order to make plans fully reliable, and in the spirit of seeking truth, they have adopted an active, steady, and gradual approach to create conditions for a larger bumper harvest in the "Basic Farmland" of next year.

This year, Shanxi promoted the "Basic Farmland" system throughout the province, changing extensive planting and low yields to less planting and more yields, which had a significant effect on transforming the backward production situation in low-yield areas. In October, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee made a decision at the County Party Secretary meeting to continue vigorously promoting this system. The plan for 1959 is to establish an average of two mu of "Basic Farmland" per person throughout the province, further reducing the more than 46 million mu of cultivated land to 32 million mu. After this major reform was deployed to the grassroots, rural cadres and peasants supported it and actively implemented it. However, two different ideas and practices emerged in the specific implementation. One was that leaders in some areas did not carefully analyze the specific conditions of their localities and excessively reduced cultivated land through over-retiring land. Another situation was that some people still had concerns about the practice of less planting and more harvesting. They said, "It's hard to get a hundred dan of grain without planting a hundred mu of land." Some cadres and peasants in southern Shanxi believed that mountains would not harvest, but plains would, and dry land would not harvest, but irrigated land would; more planting is always safer than less planting, and they were unwilling to retire land. After analyzing and studying these situations, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee believed that these biases might affect the earnest implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system and the rapid growth of grain production. In order to avoid the sudden reduction of cultivated land affecting the growth of total grain output in the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system, and to gradually create conditions and gradually realize the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system, the Provincial Party Committee decided to adopt a method that is both actively promoting and gradually realizing, requiring all localities to unswervingly implement the "Basic Farmland" system. First, ensure that the existing 32 million mu of "Basic Farmland" are planted well and yield highly. At the same time, expand planting by an additional 8 million mu of non-basic farmland. This will not only actively promote and help implement the "Basic Farmland" system but also increase the guarantee coefficient for the continuous growth of grain output throughout the province, and also take into account regional and mass habits, making it easier for farmers to accept.

At present, the Provincial Party Committee's new deployment of actively and steadily implementing the "Basic Farmland" system has been delivered to rural areas. According to this new spirit, in addition to vigorously grasping the production-increasing measures to ensure the "Basic Farmland," leadership departments at all levels are also realistically increasing a portion of non-basic farmland in a planned way based on local conditions, making the plan more complete and reliable. In addition to ensuring the key management of the 4.2 million mu of "Basic Farmland" established, the Yanbei region plans to plant an additional 1.05 million mu of non-basic farmland. The Jinan region plans to expand planting of non-basic farmland by 4 million mu in addition to the 8.8 million mu of "Basic Farmland." According to the Provincial Party Committee's requirements for all localities, next year, while establishing 32 million mu of "Basic Farmland" throughout the province, 8 million mu will be selected from non-basic farmland for planting oil crops, vegetables, and grains.

Currently, in order to ensure a high-yield and bumper harvest in the "Basic Farmland" next year, a winter basic construction campaign centered on the construction of "Basic Farmland" is being carried out on a large scale and at a rapid pace throughout the rural areas of Shanxi Province. Up to now, more than 23.7 million mu of land have been deep-plowed, and more than 7,000 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects have been started. Efforts are also being made to utilize retired cultivated land, afforesting 30 million mu of retired steep slope land and barren mountains. This winter and next spring, efforts will be made to ensure that all 32 million mu of "Basic Farmland" are water-conserved, and that 80% of the "Basic Farmland" becomes "guaranteed water land" that is "free from disasters in heavy rain and guarantees a good harvest without rain." The remaining 20% of the "Basic Farmland" will be guaranteed to be irrigated once or twice during the seasons when water is most needed. At the same time, all localities are formulating plans and preparing early to fully implement the eight production-increasing measures of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, prevention and control of diseases and pests, reform of tools, and strengthening field management in the "Basic Farmland." In order to do a good job in the planting of non-basic farmland, the Jinan region is preparing to establish specialized teams and implement a responsibility system; the Yanbei region is rushing to plow non-basic farmland.

(Our Newspaper News) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region recently held its Seventh Rural Work Conference, which unanimously resolved to resolutely implement the principle of "less planting, good planting, high yield, and more harvest" in agricultural production in order to achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

This conference was a mobilization meeting for the revolution in the agricultural cultivation system in the Autonomous Region and also a profound rectification meeting.

According to the actual experience of agricultural production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year, the conference believes that in order to win the victory of a great leap forward in agricultural production next year, it is necessary to thoroughly revolutionize the cultivation system of extensive planting and low yields, and crude cultivation and shallow plowing. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a large land area and a small population, with an average of more than ten mu of cultivated land per agricultural person and an average of thirty to forty mu per agricultural laborer, thus forming the habit of extensive planting and low yields for a long time, and the yield per unit area has always been very low. Although a bumper harvest has been achieved this year, the backwardness left over from the history of agriculture in the Autonomous Region has not been fundamentally changed, and the yield per unit area is still low.

The conference believes that the establishment of the Basic Farmland system is a decisive measure to fundamentally change the backwardness of agricultural production in the Autonomous Region. This measure has extremely important and far-reaching significance for the high-speed development of agricultural and animal husbandry production in the Autonomous Region. First, the unreasonable land utilization left over from history will be changed. The imbalance between agriculture and animal husbandry, and between forestry and non-forestry in some areas will be reversed in the process of establishing basic farmland, so that agriculture and animal husbandry can be reasonably developed. Secondly, the habit of extensive planting and low yields in the Autonomous Region can be fundamentally changed, and manpower and materials can be concentrated for intensive cultivation to increase the yield per unit area. Third, in terms of developing animal husbandry, the release of a large amount of land creates favorable conditions for establishing a solid feed base in rural areas. Fourth, the realization of agricultural mechanization can be accelerated. Fifth, changing from extensive planting and low yields to less planting and more yields will make it possible to quickly change the situation of "more than 7 million farmers engaging in food production" in the Autonomous Region, thereby freeing up more manpower for industry.

The conference believes that in order to ensure the realization of the above principles, it is also necessary to resolutely and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. This winter and next spring, we must focus on water, soil, fertilizer, and tool reform, and at the same time prepare for other measures.

Regarding the work of rectifying and consolidating people's communes, the conference put forward seven tasks: (1) to firmly grasp the leadership of production; (2) to firmly grasp socialist and communist education; (3) to do a good job in the people's lives; (4) to earnestly do a good job in this year's income distribution; (5) to actively and correctly handle economic issues; (6) to improve the system of people's communes; (7) to transform backward townships.

The conference also studied how to strengthen the Party's leadership in the great leap forward in agricultural production and accelerate the development of animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline occupations, and accordingly put forward specific measures and plans.

    积极稳步推行基本农田制
    山西增种部分非基本农田为大丰产创造条件
    内蒙古实行少种多收促进农牧生产一齐发展
    本报讯  记者杨义报道：山西省在推行“基本农田”制度中，为了使计划充分可靠，本着求实的精神，采取了积极稳步逐步实现的办法，为明年“基本农田”的更大丰产积极创造条件。
    今年山西由于全省推广“基本农田”制度，变广种薄收为少种多收，对改造低产区生产落后面貌发生了巨大的作用。10月间，中共山西省委在县委书记会议上，作出了继续大力推广这一制度的决定。计划1959年平均全省每人建立二亩“基本农田”，把四千六百多万亩耕地进一步减少到三千二百万亩。这项重大改革布置到基层以后，各地农村干部和农民十分拥护，积极执行。但是在具体执行中产生了两种不同的思想和作法。一种是有些地区的领导干部不仔细分析当地的具体条件，过多地退耕、缩小了耕地。另一种情况是有些人对少种多收的作法仍有顾虑。他们说：“不种百亩地，难打百石粮”，晋南地区有些干部、农民认为，山区不收平川收，水地不收山地收，多种总比少种保险，不愿退耕。中共山西省委分析研究了这些情况以后，认为这些偏向都可能会影响到“基本农田”制度的认真贯彻和粮食产量的迅速增长。为了在实行“基本农田”制度中，避免骤然缩减耕地影响粮食总产量的增长，为贯彻“基本农田”制度，逐步创造条件，逐步实现，省委决定采取既是积极推广又是逐步实现的办法，要求各地坚定不移地贯彻“基本农田”制度。首先保证现有三千二百万亩“基本农田”种好、高产。同时在“基本农田”之外，再扩大种植八百万亩非基本农田耕地。这样既可以积极地推广和有助于贯彻“基本农田”制度，又增加了全省粮食产量不断增长的保证系数，同时也照顾了地区和群众习惯，便于农民接受。
    目前，省委积极稳步贯彻“基本农田”制度的新部署已经下达到农村各地。各级领导部门根据这个新精神，除了大力抓保证“基本农田”的增产措施外，同时根据当地具体条件，实事求是地有计划地增加了一部分非基本农田耕地，使计划更加充分可靠。雁北地区在保证建立的四百二十万亩“基本农田”重点经营以外，再种植非基本农田耕地一百零五万亩，晋南地区计划在八百八十万亩“基本农田”外，再扩大种植非基本农田耕地四百万亩。按照省委对各地的要求，明年全省在建立三千二百万亩“基本农田”的同时，从非基本农田内再挑选八百万亩种植油料、蔬菜和粮食。
    现在，山西省农村各地为确保“基本农田”在明年取得高产丰收，开展的规模壮阔、进度猛快的、以建设“基本农田”为中心的冬季基本建设运动已普遍展开。到目前为止，全省已深翻地二千三百七十多万亩，动工兴建的大、中、小型水利工程已达七千多处。并且大力开展退耕地利用工作，在退耕陡坡地和荒山上造林三千万亩。在今冬明春保证三千二百万亩“基本农田”全部实现水利化，80％的“基本农田”都成为“大雨不成灾、无雨保丰收”的保证水地，其余20％的“基本农田”在最需要用水季节保浇一到两次。与此同时，各地都制定计划、提早准备在“基本农田”上全面贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、防治病虫害、改革工具、加强田间管理八项增产措施。晋南地区为了作好非基本农田种植工作，正准备建立专业队、实行责任制；雁北地区正突击翻耕非基本农田耕地。
    本报讯  内蒙古自治区最近召开第七次农村工作会议，一致决议在农业生产上坚决贯彻执行“少种、种好、高产、多收”方针，以实现明年农业生产的更大跃进。
    这次会议是自治区实现农业耕作制度革命的动员大会，也是一次深刻的整风会议。
    会议根据内蒙古自治区今年农业生产的实际经验，认为要取得明年农业生产大跃进的胜利，必须对广种薄收，粗耕浅作的耕作制度进行彻底的革命。内蒙古自治区地多人少，平均每个农业人口有十多亩耕地，每一农业劳动力平均有三、四十亩，因而长期形成广种薄收的习惯，单位面积产量一直很低。今年虽然获得空前大丰收，但自治区农业历史遗留下来的落后面貌，还没有根本改变，单位面积产量还低。
    会议认为，建立基本农田制是从根本上改变自治区农业生产落后面貌的带有决定性的措施。这一措施对于自治区农牧业生产的高速度发展有着极为重大而深远的意义。首先，历史上遗留下来的土地利用不合理的状况将得到改变。有些地区宜农不农、宜牧不牧、宜林不林的失调现象，在建立基本农田过程中将得到扭转，使农牧业得到合理发展。其次，可以从根本上改变自治区广种薄收的习惯，能够集中人力和物力实行精耕细作，提高单位面积产量。第三，从发展畜牧业来说，由于腾出了大量土地，就给在农村建立巩固的饲料基地创造了有利条件。第四，可以加速实现农业机械化。第五，改广种薄收为少种多收，将有可能很快地改变自治区“七百多万农民搞吃”的局面，从而腾出更多的人力搞工业。
    会议认为，要保证实现上述方针，还必须坚决地全面地贯彻执行农业的“八字宪法”。今冬明春必须以水、土、肥、工具改革为中心，同时作好其他各项措施的准备工作。
    关于整顿巩固人民公社的工作，会议提出了七项任务：（1）要紧紧抓紧对生产的领导；（2）抓紧进行社会主义、共产主义教育；（3）要把人民生活工作搞好；（4）要切实作好今年的收益分配；（5）必须积极地正确地处理经济问题；（6）健全人民公社的体制；（7）要改造落后乡。
    这次会议还研究了如何加强党对农业生产大跃进的领导和加速发展畜牧业、林业和副业等问题，并且相应地提出了具体措施和方案。
