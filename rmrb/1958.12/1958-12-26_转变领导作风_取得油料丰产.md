Change Leadership Style and Achieve a Bumper Harvest of Oil Crops
中共湖北松滋县委会 (The Chinese Communist Party, Songzi County Committee, Hubei)

Songzi County has been expanding its rapeseed planting area year by year. This year, the county's 73,000 mu of rapeseed achieved an average yield of 168 jin per mu, with a total output increase of 20% compared to 1957.

Songzi County began trial planting "Victory Rapeseed" in the winter of 1954. Although "Victory Rapeseed" is a superior variety, in the past few years of trial planting, the yield had remained low because cultivation techniques were not improved, and the habit of rough planting and low yield was not completely overcome. In 1957, the average yield was only 93 jin per mu.

This year's increase in rapeseed production has made us deeply aware of the importance of changing leadership style and methods in promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production. In 1956, due to the bureaucracy in the leadership style of our County Committee and insufficient adherence to the mass line in developing production, relatively serious coercion and commandism appeared in some areas, dampening the enthusiasm of the masses. The cotton production of more than 80,000 mu in Datongwei decreased by 21% compared to 1955. In 1957, because we did not deeply and comprehensively accept the lessons of Datongwei's production reduction, we again committed right-leaning conservatism and held back. This was prominently reflected in the emergence of many phenomena in Babaowei, such as dense planting being changed to sparse planting, row planting being changed to broadcast sowing, early sowing being changed to late sowing, double cropping being changed to single cropping, and double-furrow plows being changed to double-hanging plows. Many cadres only talked but did not act, did not participate in production, and did not go deep into the fields, leading production through meetings. The masses reflected that the cadres were like "young masters." In that year, Babaowei's 97,000 mu of cotton fields only produced 56 jin of ginned cotton per mu, a decrease of 21% compared to 1956. Two years with two production reduction weis—this lesson was really too profound for us, making us deeply realize that a generalized leadership style and working method cannot lead production well. A major change in ideological style and leadership method is necessary to achieve a great leap forward in production.

We repeatedly examined our work style, openly criticized our conservatism and bureaucracy to all Party members and cadres, and mobilized cadres to severely criticize the errors in our leadership style. In leading production, the nineteen County Committee members all divided into areas, set fixed points, and divided up the responsibility for specific crops. The offices were moved down to the villages. In this way, we got rid of affairs and were able to go deep into the fields, participate in production, and lead production. Through rectification, more than 1,300 township and commune cadres throughout the county volunteered to work in production teams. A high tide of comparing vigor, comparing progress, and comparing leaps forward gradually formed. The County Committee also organized the masses to carry out great debates, using the method of calculating three accounts to defeat conservative ideas.

The first account was to calculate the production increase account of "Victory Rapeseed." Although the average yield of "Victory Rapeseed" in our county has not been high in the past few years, there have been many high-yield examples. Various places seized the opportunity to find examples, calculate examples, and summarize examples, using typical cases to strengthen the confidence of the vast number of cadres and the masses in expanding the area of rapeseed.

The second account was to calculate the increase in income from developing "Victory Rapeseed." For example, in the Baisuitang Cooperative of Dalukou Township, the rapeseed area accounted for only 15.6% of the dry land area, but the total income accounted for 43% of the total spring income of the dry land, and each household could receive 44 yuan. After this calculation, cadres and the masses launched a heated campaign of winter sowing to combat drought, and the rapeseed area reached 19.3% of the winter sowing area.

The third account was to calculate the account of supporting national industrial construction. The rapeseed produced in our county can meet the county's people's needs for cooking oil. According to the original plan, the county can harvest more than 13 million jin of rapeseed in 1958, which, after reserving seeds, can all be sold to the state to support industrial construction. The result of the accounting comparison and great debate deeply educated the vast number of cadres and the masses, making them realize the consistency of national interests, collective interests, and individual interests, and they were full of confidence in fighting drought and sowing.

In terms of leadership methods, in addition to cadres generally planting experimental fields, we accepted the lesson of 1957 that the focus was not prominent and the leadership was generalized, and adopted the method of "multi-point demonstration, layer-by-layer fixed points, monthly evaluations, and periodic inspections," so that every district had a key township, every township had a key commune, every commune had a key team, and every team had a key field. In this way, the leadership work strived for the initiative.

During the major inspection last winter, we discovered that there were sixteen third-category townships, one hundred and eighty-two third-category communes, and sixteen thousand mu of third-category rapeseed. On the one hand, we actively transferred more than 200 cadres with rural work experience to the communes and townships to strengthen leadership; on the other hand, we promoted the experience of "four rectifications" in the fields of Zhongling Cooperative in Mashui Township (rectifying the Party, rectifying the League, rectifying the commune, and rectifying backward fields), rectifying backward fields while rectifying ideology, and at the same time launching a competition movement of communes catching up with communes, teams catching up with teams, people catching up with people, and fields catching up with fields, promoting the advanced to become more advanced, the backward to catch up with the advanced, and striving for the balance of the production movement.

For the cultivation of "Victory Rapeseed," we adopted the following seven new technical measures:

1.  Select good varieties and carefully select seeds. Due to grasping the seed selection work, the purity of rapeseed is generally above 95%.

2.  Seize the opportunity and sow in a timely manner. Last year, under the condition of more than 80 days of winter drought, sowing began at the Autumn Equinox and ended at the Cold Dew, which was appropriately advanced by eight days compared to previous years.

3.  Plow deep, harrow finely, and sow evenly for strong growth. Rapeseed seeds are small, the main root of the plant goes deep into the soil, the branch roots and fibrous roots are developed, and they are widely distributed. Only in fertile, deep, and loose soil can the seeds emerge evenly and the plant grow well. Therefore, last year we changed the old habit of one plowing and one harrowing, generally reaching a depth of four and a half to six inches, achieving two plowings and two harrowings, narrow ridges and deep plowing, flat ditch bottoms, deep ditch bottoms, and interconnected ditches for dry fields after rain.

4.  Eat less and more frequently, and apply fertilizer evenly.

5.  Pass the seedling stage well. We seized three thinning opportunities. The first time was to "fight crowding" to avoid seedling shortage; the second time was to remove the weak and eliminate impurities, which was carried out when there were two true leaves; the third time was to set the seedlings when there were four true leaves. In terms of seedling density, there are generally between 18,000 and 25,000 plants per mu.

6.  Manage to the field, assign responsibility to individuals, and have clear rewards and punishments.

7.  Harvest in a timely manner, and harvest and thresh carefully. During the period when rapeseed changed from green to yellow, we generally fixed special personnel to observe regularly, check each plot one by one, and harvest when it was 90% yellow. Many experimental fields even achieved harvesting root by root when it was yellow.

    转变领导作风  取得油料丰产
    中共湖北松滋县委会
    松滋县种植油菜面积逐年扩大。今年全县七万三千亩油菜，平均亩产一百六十八斤，总产量比1957年增产20％。
    松滋县由1954年冬试种胜利油菜。胜利油菜虽属优良品种，但在过去几年的试种中，由于栽培技术没有改进，粗种少收的习惯没有完全克服，因而产量一直不高，1957年平均亩产仅九十三斤。
    今年油菜的增产，使我们深深认识到领导转变作风，改变方法对于促进农业生产大跃进的重要性。1956年曾经因为我们县委领导作风上的官僚主义，在发展生产中走群众路线不够，在某些地区出现了比较严重的强迫命令，挫伤了群众的积极性，大同垸八万多亩棉花比1955年减产21％。1957年由于我们对大同垸的减产教训没有深刻的全面的接受，又犯了右倾保守、缩手缩脚的错误。这又突出地反映在八宝垸出现了许多密植改稀植、条播改撒播、早播改迟播、双季改单季、双铧犁改双挂犁的现象；很多干部动口不动手，不参加生产，不深入田间，凭会议领导生产，群众反映干部像“相公”。这一年八宝垸九万七千亩棉田，每亩只产五十六斤皮棉，比1956年减产21％。两年出现两个减产垸，这个教训对我们来说实在太深了，使我们最深刻地认识到：一般化的领导作风和工作方法是无法领导好生产的，必须从思想作风和领导方法上来个大转变，才能取得生产大跃进。
    我们反复地检查工作作风，公开地向全体党员、全体干部检讨了保守主义、官僚主义错误，发动干部对我们领导作风上的错误开展了严厉的批评。在领导生产上，十九个县委都分片定点，分作物进行了分工包干，办公室搬下了乡。这样，就摆脱了事务，做到了深入田间，参加生产，领导生产。通过整风全县有一千三百多个乡、社干部自愿到生产队去担任工作了。一个比干劲、比先进、比跃进的高潮日渐形成。县委又组织群众开展了大辩论，用算好三笔账的方法，击退了保守思想。
    第一笔是算胜利油菜的增产账。过去几年胜利油菜在我县虽然平均单产不高，但高产典型却已不少。各地就抓住了找典型、算典型、总结典型，用典型事例来坚定了广大干部和群众扩大油菜面积的信心。
    第二笔是算发展胜利油菜增加收入账。例如大路口乡白水淌社油菜面积只占旱田面积的15.6％，而总收入占旱田春季总收入的43％，分给社员每户可达四十四元。这样一算，干部群众掀起了热火朝天的抗旱冬播，结果油菜面积达到冬播面积的19.3％。
    第三笔是算支援国家工业建设账。我们县所产菜籽可供全县人民食油需要，按照原订规划全县1958年可收菜籽一千三百多万斤，除留种子外可以全部卖给国家支援工业建设。算账对比大辩论的结果，使广大干部和群众受到了深刻的教育，认识了国家利益、集体利益、个人利益的一致性，信心百倍抗旱播种。
    在领导方法上，除了干部普遍种试验田以外，我们接受了1957年重点不突出，领导一般化的教训，采取了“多点示范，层层定点，月月评比，段段检查”的办法，作到了区区有重点乡，乡乡有重点社，社社有重点队，队队有重点田。这样一来，领导工作就争取了主动。
    去冬大检查中，我们发现了有十六个三类乡，一百八十二个三类社，一万六千亩三类油菜。一方面我们积极地下放二百多个有农村工作经验的干部到社到乡，加强了领导；另外我们又推广了麻水乡中岭社田间“四整”的经验（整党、整团、整社、整落后田），一边改造落后田，一边改造思想，同时开展了社赶社、队赶队、人赶人、田赶田的优胜竞赛运动，促进了先进更先进、落后赶先进，争取了生产运动的平衡。
    对胜利油菜的栽培，我们采取了以下七项新的技术措施：
    一、选用良种，精细选种。由于抓住了选种工作，油菜纯度一般在95％以上。
    二、抓紧时机，适时播种。去年在八十多天的冬旱情况下，秋分开始播种到寒露结束，比往年适当提前八天。
    三、耕的深，耙的细，播的匀，长得胖。油菜种子细小，植株主根入土较深，支根和虚根发达，而且分布很广，只有在肥沃深厚和疏松平整的土壤里，种子才能出得整齐，植株生长发育也才好，所以去年我们改变了一犁一耙的旧习惯，一般达到深耕四寸五到六寸，作到了二耕二耙，作到了窄厢深耕、沟底平、沟底深、沟沟相通、雨住田干。
    四、少吃多餐，均匀施肥。
    五、过好苗期关。我们抓住了三次间苗。第一次是“打拥挤”，免除苗荒；第二次是去弱除杂，在两片真叶时进行；第三次是四片真叶时进行定苗。在留苗密度上，每亩一般在一万八千到二万五千株之间。
    六、管理到田，责任到人，奖惩严明。
    七、适时收获，细收细打。在油菜由青转黄的时期，我们普遍固定专人，定时观测，逐块检查，掌握了黄到九成就进行收获，不少试验田还做到了黄一根拔一根。
