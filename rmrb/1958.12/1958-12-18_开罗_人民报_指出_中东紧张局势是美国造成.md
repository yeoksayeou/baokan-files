Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 16th. The "People's News" in Cairo stated in an editorial on the 15th, when discussing who should be responsible for the tension in the Middle East, that the United States, colluding with other imperialist countries, plotted conspiracies, and used military treaties, the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and various imperialist running dogs to isolate the United Arab Republic and to economically and politically resist it.

The newspaper pointed out that the United States' aim is to suppress national liberation movements and Arab nationalism.

The newspaper pointed out that because it failed to achieve its goals, the United States carried out more malicious conspiracies. In Algeria, the United States allowed France to use NATO weapons against the Algerians; in Bahrain, the United States is attempting to crush Arab nationalism there; in Aden, the United States is supporting Britain in expelling Arab patriots and concealing or even supporting the crimes committed by imperialism; the United States also attempted to occupy Lebanon and supported British occupation of Jordan.

    开罗“人民报”指出
    中东紧张局势是美国造成
    新华社开罗16日电  “人民报”15日在社论中谈到中东的紧张局势应该由谁负责的问题时指出，美国同其他帝国主义国家狼狈为奸，策划阴谋，通过军事条约，“艾森豪威尔主义”和种种帝国主义走狗来孤立阿拉伯联合共和国，并且在经济上和政治上抵制它。
    这家报纸指出，美国的目的是要镇压民族解放运动和阿拉伯民族主义。
    报纸指出，由于它没有能实现它的目的，美国进行了更恶毒的阴谋；在阿尔及利亚，美国允许法国使用北大西洋公约组织的武器来对付阿尔及利亚人；在巴林，美国正在企图粉碎那里的阿拉伯民族主义，在亚丁，美国正在支持英国驱逐阿拉伯爱国者以及掩饰甚至支持帝国主义所犯的罪行；美国还企图占领黎巴嫩，并且支持英国占领约旦。
