Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 20th: Anhui Province, in its procurement of agricultural and sideline products, has combined the working method of the mass line with a pragmatic work style, which has both accelerated the progress of procurement and ensured the quality of the products.

    So far, Anhui has overfulfilled the state's annual procurement plans for live pigs, eggs, cotton, and tea. The procurement of flue-cured tobacco has also increased by half compared to the same period last year. The progress of hemp procurement has been relatively slow, but new measures have recently been adopted, and the progress has begun to improve. According to the inspection by the financial and trade departments, the quality of agricultural and sideline products is relatively good. More than 320,000 live pigs transferred to the Bengbu Meat Processing Factory from May to August generally weighed over 100 jin each. Cotton, hemp, and tobacco have all been graded. 96% of the cotton procured by the Bengbu Special District reached the prescribed standards.

    In order to procure quickly, procure more, procure well, and procure sufficiently, all localities have fully relied on the masses, handing over tasks, samples, technology, and prices to the people's communes. Based on this, they have vigorously promoted the "Four On-the-Spot" methods of on-the-spot inspection and grading by the commune, on-the-spot procurement by the commune, on-the-spot processing by the commune, and on-the-spot storage by the commune. They have made full use of civilian housing and folk processing tools to store and process agricultural and sideline products, which has ensured the smooth progress of procurement work.

    While relying on the masses for procurement, attention has also been paid to emphasizing a pragmatic work style, opposing crudeness and falsehood in work, and proposing that all procured agricultural and sideline products must be carefully weighed and graded.

    安徽使群众路线和踏实作风结合
    据新华社合肥20日电  安徽省在农副产品采购工作中，把群众路线的工作方法和踏踏实实的工作作风结合起来，既加速了农副产品的采购进度，又保证了农副产品的质量。
    到目前为止，国家分配给安徽全年的生猪、鸡蛋、棉花和茶叶收购计划已经超额完成。烤烟的收购量也比去年同期增加半倍。麻类的收购进度比较慢，但是最近采取了新措施，收购进度也已经开始好转。根据财贸部门的检查，农副产品的质量比较好。全省在5月到8月份调给蚌埠肉类加工厂的三十二万多头生猪，一般每头都在一百斤以上。棉、麻、烟都分了等级。蚌埠专区收购的棉花品级有96％都达到了规定的标准。
    为了能够快收、多收、收好、收足，各地都充分依靠了群众，把任务、样品、技术、价格交给人民公社掌握，并在这个基础上大力推行就社验级、就社收购、就社加工、就社保管的“四就”方法，充分利用民房和民间加工工具保存和加工农副产品，使采购工作顺利进行。
    在依靠群众采购的同时，还注意强调踏踏实实的工作作风，反对工作中的粗糙和虚假现象，提出收购的农副产品都要认真地进行过秤和验级。
