Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The delegates to the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference today reviewed with excitement and pride the brilliant achievements of rural women across the country on the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery fronts. All the speeches convincingly demonstrated that Chinese women are becoming a major labor force in the countryside.

    High-Yield Records Inspire
    Women can also create high-yield records. Several representatives who spoke today reported their good news of increased production to the conference, giving great encouragement to all the delegates. Lu Guiying, platoon leader of the first platoon of the Red Star Company of the Liming People's Commune in Zongyang County, Anhui Province, and twenty-three other women, with the support of the local Party committee, planted 1.1 mu of middle-season rice experimental fields. They humbly consulted with experienced farmers, diligently studied, and broke with conventions, implementing a series of technical measures in the experimental fields. As a result, the yield per mu reached 33,953 jin, creating the highest record for middle-season rice yield per mu in the county. Xie Yinxing from Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, mentioned in her speech that the "Liu Hulan High-Yield Group" of the Hanjiaoshui People's Commune, which she represents, overcame numerous difficulties, passed through the three "barriers" of technology, drought, and fertilizer, and achieved a dryland grain yield of 4,575 jin per mu, more than twenty times higher than the highest local yield in the bumper year of 1956. In Weichang County, Hebei Province, where the land is vast and sparsely populated, the soil is barren, the climate is cold, and the frost-free period is only ninety days a year, the youth production team led by Zhang Lianfang, a women activist from the Satellite People's Commune, created a record of over 1,200 jin of wheat per mu, becoming the first "thousand-jin team" in the county, promoting the raising of more than 1,400 red flags of "thousand-jin teams" and "thousand-jin groups" throughout the team. These representatives all talked about how women in production had been subjected to much sarcasm, attacks and obstructions, but with the support and encouragement of the Party organization, they overcame various difficulties and achieved results, leaving those who discriminated against women speechless in the face of facts. Shen Jilan, the famous agricultural labor model, reported to the conference that the women of the Jinxing People's Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, where she is located, have become the main force in agricultural production this year, taking on almost all the tasks of summer planting and autumn harvesting. During this period, they completed more than 320,000 workdays, accounting for 53.8% of the total agricultural labor in the commune, with each woman's workday increasing by an average of more than twice that of last year. Male commune members praised, "Women are better than men, farming is like Shennong, and women get the first credit for this year's great agricultural harvest."

    "Clever Girls" Can Do Anything
    In the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, many women production experts have emerged. Several activists who spoke today are such people. Their achievements powerfully prove that women can do anything and do everything well. There is Song Chou'er from Mishan Township, Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, who, along with two other young girls, can do everything from plowing, digging ditches, close planting, soaking seeds, mixing seeds, weeding, transplanting, growing vegetables, and pollinating in agricultural production, to beekeeping, grafting trees, raising pigs, and raising chickens in sideline occupations, to paper cutting, embroidery, tailoring in handicrafts, and steelmaking, grinding balls, pedaling pressing machines, and operating pot camel machines in industry. Therefore, they are affectionately called "clever girls" by the people. There is also Xie Yuanbi, a sixteen-year-old girl from Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, who, after a period of time, trained the cattle to be very docile and obedient, and plowed very skillfully with ten double-wheeled double-furrow plows; she also created various tools such as gourd strip planters and portable box planters, and was therefore rated as an advanced worker in technical innovation in the county. There is Li Renying, deputy captain of the Juntun Commune production team in Mouding, Yunnan Province, who, because of her continuous improvement of weeding tools and weeding methods, can weed more than 281 mu of rice seedlings per person per day and night, and is therefore famous throughout the county and the entire autonomous prefecture. There is also Tuluhanni Nyazi, a female member of the Third People's Commune in Baicheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who took the lead in setting up a fertilizer factory, which now has a daily output of 800 jin and a fertilizer efficiency of 100%. The entire county has summarized and promoted their fertilizer production experience. Feng Yongmei, director of the "Mu Guiying" Logging Factory of the Hongqi People's Commune in Jianghua Yao Autonomous County, Hunan Province, introduced to everyone that more than seventy women there participated in logging work for the first time and learned more than ten kinds of forestry production technologies. Bao Lianhua, from Du'erbote Mongolian Autonomous County, Heilongjiang Province, finally learned sheep breeding technology after many arduous struggles. Hong Yuzhen, a representative from Qinghai Province, used to be a housewife, but now she has become a skilled tractor driver. Zhang Xiqin, who grew up on the coast of Hui'an County, Fujian Province, broke through feudal customs and became one of the first girls to go to sea to fish. They all paved the way for rural women to master multiple skills with their heroic and courageous labor.

    Give Full Play to Special Skills in Diversified Operations
    Today's speeches also showed that women who give full play to their special skills for the diversified operations of people's communes have accumulated a lot of valuable experience in tea picking, silkworm raising, and pig raising. Xie Chengzhen, a representative from Wufeng County, Hubei Province, who is praised by the masses as "Seven Tea-Picking Fairies," and Wang Fengyun, director of the Liu Hulan Silkworm Farm of the Liushipu People's Commune in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, reported in their speeches their moving deeds of working hard and cleverly, studying diligently and practicing continuously to improve their technical level. The "Seven Tea-Picking Fairies" not only learned tea-picking methods such as "rooster pecking rice," "reverse palm tea picking," and "bow-shaped direct shot," but also created a whole set of rapid tea-picking methods, using eight fingers simultaneously, picking multiple buds at a time, which made the tea-picking record rise in a straight line. In the past, the general daily picking of fresh leaves was one or twenty jin, but now it has reached 1,157 jin. Shu Manrong, deputy director of the Wanneng Pig Farm of the Yinshan People's Commune in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, introduced the new feeding and management methods of pig raising to the conference in a humorous way, which attracted the attention of the representatives. Fan Xiucai, a national pig-raising model, was hired as a researcher by the Northwest Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in August this year. In her speech today, she said excitedly: I, a child bride who was discriminated against and suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society, have now become a labor model. This is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation. After I received the award, the villagers were all happy and said, "Pig guests can also be models." Dong Caizhu, a women activist from Jiangxi Province, reported to the representatives today about the bumper harvest of women's sugarcane experimental fields.

    Heroic Battles to Transform Nature
    In the battles to transform nature such as water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and afforestation, women are also a force to be reckoned with. Two representatives from Guangxi and Inner Mongolia spoke at the meeting about their heroic battles in the water conservancy construction movement. Quan Meiquan is a Zhuang girl from Longjin County, Guangxi. In January this year, she responded to the Party's call and organized a shock team with sixteen young women to participate in the construction of the Tonggui Water Conservancy Project. On the construction site, they were all full of energy. In a very short period of time, they learned techniques such as drilling blasting holes and pulling carts. They have won the red flag four times in a row, and Quan Meiquan herself has been rated as a special-class labor model twice. Sang Rui, a fifty-six-year-old Daur woman, announced to everyone in her speech that more than 100 women from the Bayantuohai Sumu of the Ewenki Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had built the first reservoir in the pastoral area, the Aorenbaoligao "March 8th" Reservoir, in sixteen days. The reservoir has an area of 30,000 square meters and a storage capacity of 24,000 cubic meters, which can provide drinking water for 40,000 livestock, ending the history of waterlessness on this grassland. The herdsmen call this reservoir "treasure house." Mi Ruizhen, deputy county head of Yanggu County, Shandong Province, introduced in her speech the process of her leading the masses to improve alkaline land. In the northwest of Yanggu County, there is a large alkaline depression with a radius of eighty miles, called Goose and Duck Slope. Mi Ruizhen accepted the task assigned by the Party and fought there with the local farmers for five months, and finally transformed this alkaline land, which "hasn't been fertilized for ten thousand years and hasn't been plowed for a thousand years," into more than 10,000 mu of fertile land growing lush grain and cotton crops. This year, the average yield per mu reached more than 1,500 jin, and the total grain output increased fifty times compared with previous years. Chen Jiao, a women activist from Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, reported to everyone that the women of the Hongxing People's Commune where she is located had conquered the wind and sand and built a magnificent green Great Wall on the beach where even weeds could not grow. They not only made a forest belt 150 to 280 meters wide and more than 20 kilometers long appear in the barren sandy area, as well as three parallel bamboo belts, orchard belts, and mangrove belts, but also built a "March 8th" highway in the orchard, planted wildflowers, and built stone benches, turning the wasteland into a beautiful garden.

    A total of twenty-one people spoke at the conference today. The conference will continue on the 9th.

    妇女种地赛神农  农村生产夺大功
    妇女积极分子报告农林牧副渔各个战线上的成就
    新华社8日讯  全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议的全体代表，今天以兴奋、自豪的心情，检阅了全国农村妇女在农、林、牧、副、渔等各个生产战线上的辉煌战果。所有的发言，都令人信服地说明了：中国妇女正在成为农村中的一支劳动大军。
    高额丰产纪录  鼓舞人心
    妇女也能创造高额丰产纪录。今天发言的好几位代表，向大会报告了她们的增产喜讯，给全体代表莫大的鼓舞。安徽省枞阳县黎明人民公社红星连第一排排长陆桂英，和二十三名妇女在当地党委支持下，种了一点一一亩中稻试验田。她们虚心向老农请教，勤学苦钻，并打破陈规，在试验田里实行了一系列的技术措施，结果亩产量达到三万三千九百五十三斤，创造了全县中稻亩产量的最高纪录。宁夏回族自治区同心县的谢银香在发言中谈到，她所代表的喊叫水人民公社的“刘胡兰丰产小组”，克服重重困难，闯过了技术、干旱、肥料三道“关”，种的旱谷亩产量达到四千五百七十五斤，比丰收的1956年当地最高产量高出二十多倍。在地广人稀、土地瘠薄、气候寒冷、全年无霜期只有九十天的河北省围场县卫星人民公社，妇女积极分子张连芳所领导的青年生产队，创造了小麦亩产一千二百多斤的纪录，成为全县第一个千斤队，推动全队插起了一千四百多面千斤队、千斤组的红旗。这几位代表都谈到妇女在生产中，曾经受到不少讽刺打击和阻难，但她们在党组织的支持鼓励下，克服各种困难，作出了成绩，使那些歧视妇女的人，在事实面前哑口无言。著名的农业劳动模范申纪兰，向大会报告她所在的山西省壶关县金星人民公社的妇女们，今年已成为农业生产上的主力军，几乎全部包下了夏种和秋收的任务。在这期间，她们共做了三十二万多个劳动日，占全社农业总工数的53.8％，每个妇女的劳动日平均比去年增加两倍多。男社员们都称赞：“女将倒比男将行，种起地来赛神农，今年农业大丰收，妇女夺得头一功。”
    “巧姑娘”什么都能干
    在全民大跃进的行列里，出现了许多妇女生产能手。今天发言的积极分子中，就有好几位这样的人。她们的成就有力地证明：妇女们什么都能干，什么都干得好。这里有山西省晋城县米山乡的宋丑儿，她和另外两个小姑娘从农业生产中的翻地、开渠、密植、浸种、拌种、锄苗、定苗、种菜、授粉，到副业方面的养蜂、接树、养猪、养鸡，到手工业方面的剪花、刺绣、裁缝，以及工业方面的炼钢铁、捣滚珠、蹬压花机、开锅驼机，各种活计都能做，因此被人们亲切地叫做
  “巧姑娘”。这里还有贵州省金沙县的十六岁的姑娘谢远碧，她经过一段时间，把牛训练得很驯服，听从指挥，驾驶过十部双轮双铧犁非常纯熟地进行耕作；她还创造了葫芦条播器、手提箱式播种器等多种工具，因此被评为全县的技术革新先进工作者。这里有云南省牟定军屯社生产队副队长李仁英，她因为不断改进中耕薅锄工具和薅锄方法，每人一昼夜能薅秧二百八十一亩多，因而在全县和全自治州都出了名。这里还有新疆维吾尔自治区拜城县第三人民公社的女社员吐尔汗尼牙孜，她带头办起了一个制肥厂，现在日产量达到八百斤，肥效达到100％，全县都总结和推广了她们的制肥经验。湖南省江华瑶族自治县红旗人民公社“穆桂英”采伐厂厂长冯永妹向大家介绍她们那里的七十多名妇女破天荒地参加了林木采伐工作，并且学会了十多种林业生产技术。来自黑龙江省杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县的包莲花，经过多少艰苦斗争，终于学会了绵羊配种技术。青海省的代表洪玉珍原来是个家庭妇女，现在成了一个熟练的拖拉机手。生长在福建省惠安县海滨的张细琴冲破了封建陋习，成为当地第一批下海捕鱼的姑娘。她们都以英勇果敢的劳动，为农村妇女们掌握多样本领开辟了道路。
    在多种经营中发挥特长
    今天的发言还表明，为人民公社的多种经营发挥自己特长的妇女们，在采茶、养蚕、养猪等方面，已经积累下不少宝贵的经验。湖北省五峰县被群众赞为“采茶七仙女”的代表谢承珍，和安徽省颍上县六十铺人民公社刘胡兰养蚕场场长王凤云，在发言中汇报了她们苦干加巧干、苦学勤练不断提高技术水平的动人事迹。“采茶七仙女”不仅学会“雄鸡啄米”、“反掌采茶”、“弓形直射”等采茶法，还创造出一整套快速采茶的方法，八指齐下，一次多芽，使采茶纪录直线上升，过去一般日采鲜叶一、二十斤，现在达到了日采一千一百五十七斤。四川资中县银山人民公社万能养猪场副场长舒满容，饶有风趣地向大会介绍了养猪的新的饲养管理方法，引起了代表们的注意。全国养猪模范樊秀才，今年8月被中国农业科学院西北畜牧兽医研究所聘为研究员。她在今天的发言中，激动地说：我这个在旧社会被人歧视受尽折磨的童养媳，现在成了劳动模范，这是党和毛主席培养的结果。我受到奖励后村里人都高兴，说“猪客也能当模范。”江西省妇女积极分子董财珠，今天向代表们汇报了妇女甘蔗试验田大丰收的情况。
    改造大自然的英勇战斗
    在兴修水利、改良土壤、造林等改造大自然的战斗中，妇女们也是一支不可忽视的力量。来自广西、内蒙古的两位代表在会上畅谈她们在兴修水利运动中英勇战斗的情景。全美权是广西龙津县的一个僮族姑娘。今年1月，她响应党的号召，和十六个女青年一起组织了一个突击队参加建设同桂水利工程，在工地上，她们个个干劲十足，在很短的时间内，就学会了打炮眼、拉车等技术，曾经连续获得四次红旗，全美权本人被两次评上特等劳动模范。五十六岁的达斡尔族妇女桑瑞在发言中向大家宣布：她所在的内蒙古自治区鄂温克族自治旗巴彦托海苏木的一百多名妇女，在十六天中就建成了牧区第一座水库——敖仁保力高“三八”水库。这个水库面积达三万平方公尺，蓄水量二万四千公方，可供四万头牲畜饮水，结束了这块草原上无水的历史，牧民们都把这个水库叫做“宝库”。山东省阳谷县副县长米瑞珍在发言里介绍了她领导群众改良碱地的经过。在阳谷县西北部，有一片方圆八十里的大碱洼，叫做鹅鸭坡。米瑞珍接受党所指派的任务，在那里和当地农民一起奋战了五个月，终于把这片“万年不上粪，千年不行犁”的碱地改造成生长着茂盛的粮棉作物的一万多亩良田，今年每亩平均产量达到一千五百多斤，粮食总产量比往年提高五十倍。广东省电白县妇女积极分子陈娇向大家报告，她所在的红星人民公社的妇女们制服了风沙，在野草也不生的海滩上筑起了宏伟的绿色长城。她们不仅使荒沙地带出现了一条宽一百五十至二百八十公尺、长二十多公里的林带，以及三条平行伸展的竹带、果树带、红树林带，并且在果林中修了“三八”公路，种上野花，砌起石凳，把荒滩变成了美丽的花园。
    今天在大会上发言的一共二十一人。9日，大会将继续举行。
