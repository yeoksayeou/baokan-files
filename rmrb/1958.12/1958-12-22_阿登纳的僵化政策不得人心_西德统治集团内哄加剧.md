Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, December 19th - Adenauer government’s stubborn stance in rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal for normalizing the situation in West Berlin has caused increasing divisions within the West German ruling clique.

    Recently, Bonn officials have made great efforts to exaggerate the "unanimity" shown by Western countries at the Paris North Atlantic Council meeting on the Berlin issue, attempting to prop up Adenauer's unpopular and rigid policies. However, it is reported that West German Social Democratic Party figures openly expressed dissatisfaction with the communique of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' meeting, believing that it failed to achieve any resolution to the Berlin issue.

    Sources say that Adenauer is attempting to convene a second "consultation" with the chairmen of parliamentary groups of various parties on December 22nd regarding the so-called "Berlin crisis" in order to "coordinate" differences between them. The Social Democratic Party previously requested the Federal Parliament to hold a broad debate on foreign policy in January. This request has reportedly been rejected by the Christian Democratic Union.

    At the same time, the Adenauer group's rigid policies on the Berlin issue have also aroused dissatisfaction among lower-level members of the Christian Democratic Union. Professor Hagmann, head of the journalism department at the University of Münster, who was recently expelled from the Union for actively advocating an understanding between East and West Germany, wrote in "German and International Political News" published in Cologne on the 18th that since the founding of West Germany, Adenauer's foreign policy has never been subjected to such sharp criticism within the Union as it is now. In his article, Hagmann pointed out that within the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, there is a growing number of people who advocate holding negotiations quickly to conclude a peace treaty. Even many ministers in the Bonn cabinet support this view.

### 阿登纳的僵化政策不得人心  西德统治集团内哄加剧

    阿登纳的僵化政策不得人心
    西德统治集团内哄加剧
    新华社波恩19日电  阿登纳政府拒绝苏联关于西柏林局势正常化建议的顽固立场引起了西德统治集团内部越来越大的分歧。
    近日来波恩官方人士大事渲染西方国家在巴黎北大西洋集团理事会会议期间对西柏林问题所表现的“团结一致”，企图以此来替阿登纳的不受欢迎的僵化政策撑台。但是据报道，西德社会民主党人士对巴黎四国外长会议的公报公开表示不满，认为它并没能使柏林问题得到任何解决。
    有消息说，阿登纳企图在本月22日召集各党派议会党团主席就所谓“柏林危机”举行第二次“磋商”来“协调”彼此间的分歧。社会民主党几天前曾经要求联邦议院在明年1月间举行广泛的外交政策辩论。这个要求据说已经遭到基督教民主联盟的拒绝。
    在这同时，阿登纳集团在柏林问题上所采取的僵硬政策也在基督教民主联盟的下层盟员中间引起了不满。不久前由于积极主张东西德达成谅解而被开除出盟的明斯特大学新闻系主任哈格曼教授，18日在科隆出版的“德国与国际政治新闻”上写道，自从西德建国以来，阿登纳的外交政策从来没有在联盟内部遭到过像目前这样尖锐的指责。哈格曼在文章中指出，目前在基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟内部，主张迅速举行谈判来缔结和约的人越来越多。甚至波恩内阁中也有不少部长支持这种主张。
