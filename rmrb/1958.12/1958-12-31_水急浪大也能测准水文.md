    Accurate Hydrological Measurements Even in Rapid Currents and Large Waves
    -- Record of the People Who Successfully Created the Zero-Angle Hydrological Cableway
    In our vast land, there are tens of thousands of hydrological workers who, regardless of severe cold or intense heat, measure flow and water levels in rapid rivers. They work and conduct experimental research simultaneously, achieving great results over the past few years. The successful creation of the zero-angle hydrological cableway by comrades at the Xinchang County Hydrological Station in Zhejiang Province is a prominent example.
    Most rivers in Zhejiang Province are short with rapid currents. In the past, hydrological station cadres measured flow by crossing river sections in wooden boats, but due to the steep slopes of mountain stream riverbeds, the current was rapid and the waves were large during floods, making it difficult to control the boats. This often prevented accurate data collection and was also unsafe.
    How to measure flow accurately and safely in mountain streams has been a long-standing problem internationally. Wang Yueqiao, Zhang Shiping, Hu Zeyi, and other members of the Communist Youth League at the Xinchang County Hydrological Station, broke away from superstition, emancipated their minds, and were determined to solve this problem. They persevered through dozens of failures and finally succeeded.
    How to measure flow without using boats? The comrades at the Xinchang County Hydrological Station decided to solve this problem first. Initially, they used a rope or lead wire with measuring instruments attached, with one person standing on each bank of the river, pulling the instruments back and forth during measurements. This method could replace boat measurements when the water was low and the current slow. However, after a few pulls, the No. 14 lead wire stretched and could no longer be used for measurement. Some cadres became discouraged after seeing the failure. At this point, the leadership encouraged them and provided 2.5 mm steel wire rope to replace the lead wire. They then experimented with a water wheel-like wooden rocker, installing a back-and-forth cable to replace manual pulling. They built a cableway across the river, allowing people to operate from one bank without using a boat, essentially solving the problem of flow measurement.
    Soon, another difficulty arose. This measurement method was relatively accurate only when the water was calm. When the current was rapid and the waves were large, the measuring instruments were often pushed to the surface, failing to reach the required depth, and the measured data was often inaccurate.
    What to do? Retreat in the face of difficulty or continue to improve? Some people developed negative and fearful sentiments, but Wang Yueqiao and others were determined to further improve the technology. They frequently visited local farmers and carpenters, studied late into the night, persisted with experiments even when their clothes got wet in the rain, and operated in the water even in the cold weather. They were determined to continue and succeed. The leadership actively supported them, and the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department also sent technical cadres to help with the research. Soon, they developed a method using steel pipes installed on a tripod to drive the instruments, essentially solving the problem of the instruments floating. At the same time, this method of correcting the angle of deviation also strengthened the accuracy of the instrument's measurement point position, enabling accurate measurement of hydrological data even in cases of rapid rises and falls in floodwaters.
    In April of this year, under the guidance of professors from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University, the cadres at the Xinchang County Hydrological Station further improved the correction frame and added electric operation. Thus, the zero-angle hydrological cableway was finally successfully created.
    The successful creation of the zero-angle hydrological cableway solved the problem of flow measurement in mountain streams. It is safe, easy to operate, and provides accurate data – it withstood the test of a high flow velocity of 3.92 meters per second in a vertical line average velocity test in May this year, without any angle of deviation. This method of flow measurement can be vigorously promoted in rivers with a width of 200 meters and a depth of 10 meters or less.
    After the successful creation of the zero-angle hydrological cableway, representatives from eleven provinces, including Liaoning, Guizhou, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang, visited the site for observation and study. Cadres from hydrological stations in various counties in Zhejiang Province also went to learn. Currently, more than ten hydrological stations throughout the province have promoted the zero-angle hydrological cableway.

    水急浪大也能测准水文
    记创造无偏角水文缆道成功的人们
    在我国辽阔的土地上，有着成千上万的水文工作者，他们不论严寒酷热，在急湍的河流中测量流量和水位。他们边工作、边试验研究，几年来获得了很大的成绩。浙江省新昌县水文站的同志们创造无偏角水文缆道成功，就是一个突出的事例。
    浙江省河流大多源短流急。过去，水文站干部施测流量，都是乘木船沿河道断面横渡测量的，由于山溪性河流的河道河底坡度较陡，发生洪水时水急浪大，测船很难控制，往往不能测得正确的资料，同时也不安全。
    在山溪性河流中，如何做到准确、安全地测流，是国际上长期以来没有解决的问题。新昌县水文站的共青团员王月樵、张士平、胡泽裔等人破除迷信、解放思想，下决心解决这个问题，不屈不挠地经过了几十次的失败，最后获得了成功。
    如何做到不用乘船去测流？新昌县水文站的同志决心首先解决这个问题。他们最初采用河流两岸各站一人，各执一端带有测量仪器的绳索或铅丝，测流时把仪器拉来拉去。用这种方法，可以在水小流慢的情况下，代替木船测流。但是拉了几次以后，十四号铅丝索被拉长了，不能再继续测量了。有的干部看到失败，就开始泄气。这时领导上一面鼓励他们，一面发给二点五公厘的钢丝索代替铅丝。于是，他们又试验做水车形式的木摇车，装上来回索，代替人拉。他们跨河建立了缆道，人只要站在一边岸上操作，不用乘木船，测流的问题基本上解决了。
    不久，又发生了难题，这样的测量方法只有在水小平稳时比较正确，水急浪大时测量仪器往往被冲到水面来，达不到要求的深度，测量的资料就常常不正确。
    怎么办呢？是知难而退呢，还是继续改进呢？有的人产生消极畏难情绪，王月樵等人决心进一步改进技术。他们经常去访问当地农民、木匠，晚上研究到深夜，雨天淋湿了衣服也坚持试验，大冷天还下水操作，他们有决心搞下去，一定要搞成功。领导上积极支持他们，浙江省水利厅还派了技术干部去帮助研究。不久，他们研究出用钢管安装在三角架上带动仪器，基本上解决了仪器上浮的问题。同时用这种校正偏角方法也加强了仪器测点位置的正确性，即使在洪水暴涨暴落的情况下，也能测量准确的水文资料。
    今年4月间，新昌县水文站干部在浙江大学机械系教授的指导下，进一步改进了校正架，又装上电动操纵，这样，无偏角水文缆道终于完满地创造成功了。
    无偏角水文缆道的创造成功，解决了山溪性河流的测流问题，它既安全，操作又轻便，同时能得到准确的资料——今年5月中经过垂线平均流速三点九二秒公尺高流速的考验，没有发生偏角。这种测流方法，在河宽二百公尺、水深十公尺以内的河流可以大力推广。
    无偏角水文缆道创造成功以后，先后有辽宁、贵州、山西、黑龙江等十一个省派代表到实地参观访问，浙江省各县水文站干部也纷纷前去学习，目前全省已有十多个水文站推广了无偏角水文缆道。
