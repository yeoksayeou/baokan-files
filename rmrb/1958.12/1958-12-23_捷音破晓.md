Dawn of Victory

　　Wiping away the mud and sweat, straightening his back,
　　Guo Xiaochuan bids farewell to the small stove, longing for a sweet sleep.
　　Dreams carry him far,
　　Suddenly, he hears the dawn of victory:
　　"10.07 million tons of steel completed ahead of schedule!"
　　Good news arrives, his spirit is a thousand times better.
　　A body weary, soars to the highest heavens.
　　Red heart's blood transforms into a tide of molten steel.
　　The whole people's hard work, how can it be in vain!
　　Sleep a while longer, the day is still early.
　　He sees the Earth flying in the universe,
　　The Eastern continent adorned with colorful clouds.
　　Ten thousand stars sparkle through the clouds;
　　Through the gaps in the clouds, it is as if a prairie fire greets the wind.
　　Who created this world?
　　The scenery is so beautiful!
　　Passing through the clouds, landing on a high mountain,
　　The sound of the wind is hoarse, only the motors roar.
　　Where the motors roar, chimneys spew flames;
　　Beneath the chimneys, there are thousands of fire dragons.
　　Where does this new world come from?
　　It's so lively!
　　Jumping down from the mountain peak, crossing the wheat sea near the city suburbs.
　　The firelight flashes, illuminating the furnace clusters like a grand avenue.
　　Ten thousand heads surge, faces full of spring breeze, faces full of smiles.
　　Arms wave in unison, soaring enthusiasm, high heat.
　　What place is this?
　　It seems like he has been here before.
　　Not another life, not a foreign land, everyone knows it's China!
　　No strangers, no outsiders, everyone is an old friend.
　　Ores fill the mountains, we must find them ourselves.
　　Ten thousand steel flowers, we must water them ourselves.
　　Put on rubber shoes, take off the jacket,
　　Run to the open hearth furnace, not afraid to work through the night!
　　Focusing intently on the furnace fire, suddenly hearing a roar:
　　"10.07 million tons of steel completed ahead of schedule!"
　　Lifting his eyelids, jumping up, the sun is already high in the sky.
　　In this great time, how can we sleep in!
　　The great construction cause, must not stop halfway.
　　1959, is beckoning to us.
　　18 million tons of steel, rely on us to refine.
　　Summon steel-like strength, and another great leap forward!

    捷音破晓
    郭小川擦擦泥汗，直直身腰，告别小平炉睡个香甜觉。梦中游翔正远，忽听捷音破晓：“一千零七十万吨钢提早完成了！”喜事临门，心神千倍好。一身慵倦，飞上九重霄。通红心血化成钢水如潮。全民苦战，岂徒劳！再睡会吧，天还早。只见我地球在宇宙飞飘，东方大陆朵朵云霞缭绕。云雾中透出万支星光跳；云缝里好似野火迎风烧。谁造的天地？景致如此美妙！穿过云霞，在高山落脚，风声喑哑，只有马达呼啸。马达响处，烟囱吐火苗；烟囱底下，火龙千万条。何来新世界？这般热闹！跳下山峰，越过麦海近城郊。火光闪闪，照见炉群当大道。万头钻动，满面春风满面笑。手臂齐挥，干劲冲天热气高。这是什么所在？好似早曾来到。非隔世，非异邦，堂堂中国谁不晓！没外人，没生客，个个都是老相交。矿石藏满山，要自家去寻找。钢花千万朵，凭自家把水浇。穿上胶鞋，脱下外套，跑向平炉口，那怕干它通宵！全神注炉火，忽听一声咆哮：“一千零七十万吨钢提早完成了！”抬起眼皮跃起身，太阳已在当空照。大好时光里，怎能睡懒觉！伟大建设事业，不可停在半道。一九五九年，正对我们把手招。一千八百万吨钢，靠我们炼造。鼓起钢铁般劲头，再来个大飞跃！
