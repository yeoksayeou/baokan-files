Xinhua News Agency, December 27th. Tonight, more than 1,600 university and middle school students from the capital, along with international students from 26 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia, sang, danced, and celebrated the New Year together in the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel.

The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was brightly lit, with four shimmering golden characters, “恭贺新年” (Congratulations on the New Year), hanging in front of the stage. Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng congratulated the international students at the meeting on their greater achievements in the new year. Then, he went around the hall shaking hands warmly with the international students and inviting them to dance.

The melodious music began, and the New Year's Eve party started. Young men and women of different skin colors danced gracefully in the dance floor. The earliest foreign guests to arrive were the Soviet students, who quickly practiced several songs in order to give a wonderful performance. Many Soviet students studying at Peking University often participate in voluntary labor with Chinese students and are praised by the people. Tonight, they were very enthusiastically playing cards and dancing with their Chinese classmates with whom they spend day and night.

Around the tea tables, university students and international students from other countries chatted like relatives. Several Vietnamese students were talking particularly intimately with Liu Qun, a student from the Trade Economics Department of Renmin University of China. It turned out that they had just returned from an internship at the Evergreen People’s Commune in the suburbs of Beijing. Liu Qun excitedly told the students around him that Vietnamese student Liang Kang had been named an advanced worker for his participation in the voluntary labor to green the capital together with Chinese students, and the class he was in was awarded the title of "Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Class." Akma, an Indonesian student studying in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, met his old friend, An Rongsheng, a student in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University. They talked about their recent studies and lives in Indonesian. Akma once studied Chinese literature at Peking University, and An Rongsheng was his counselor at that time. Tonight, An Rongsheng gave Akma a Chinese version of the "Indonesian Vocabulary Collection." A group of students from Peking University warmly entertained international students from India, the United Arab Republic, and Ceylon, dancing and chatting alternately.

While people were dancing happily, various games were going on at the other end of the hall.

At the party, students from the Soviet Union and Mongolia, and students from the Beijing Art Normal College performed wonderful song and dance programs. As the night deepened, people were still immersed in the atmosphere of joy and happiness.

    让友谊之花结成幸福之果
    首都中外学生共庆新年
    新华社27日讯  今晚，首都大、中学生同来自亚、非、欧、澳各洲的二十六个国家的留学生共一千六百多人在北京饭店宴会厅里一起轻歌漫舞，共庆新年。
    北京饭店宴会厅里灯火灿烂，主席台前挂着“恭贺新年”四个闪闪发光的金字。教育部部长杨秀峰在会上祝贺各国留学生在新的一年中获得更大的成就。接着，他绕着大厅四周同留学生们亲切地握手，邀请他们去跳舞。
    悠扬的乐曲声中，联欢晚会开始了。不同肤色的青年男女们在舞池里翩翩起舞。外宾中来得最早的是苏联的留学生，他们为了给大家作精彩的演出，赶紧练习了几支歌子。在北京大学学习的好多苏联留学生经常同中国学生一起参加义务劳动，受到人们的赞扬，今晚他们又非常热情的和朝夕相处的中国同学一起打扑克、跳舞。
    四周的茶座上，大学生们和其它各国的留学生像亲人般地在叙家常。几个越南留学生和中国人民大学贸易经济系学生刘群谈得格外亲热。原来他们一起刚从京郊四季青人民公社实习归来。刘群兴奋地对周围的同学说，越南留学生梁康在和中国同学一起参加绿化首都的义务劳动中，被评为先进工作者，他所在的那个班也得到了“中越友谊班”的称号。在清华大学机械系学习的印度尼西亚留学生阿克玛和他的老朋友——北京大学东语系学生安荣生会面了，他们用印尼话交谈着近来的学习和生活情况。阿克玛曾经在北大学过中国文学，那时安荣生是他的辅导员，今晚安荣生把一本中文版的“印度尼西亚词汇集”赠给了阿克玛。北京大学的一群学生热情地招待印度、阿联和锡兰等国家的留学生，他们时而跳舞，时而交谈。
    在人们欢舞的同时，大厅的另一端进行着各种各样的游戏。
    晚会上，苏联和蒙古的留学生、北京艺术师范学院的学生们表演了精彩的歌舞节目。夜深了，人们依旧浸沉在欢乐和幸福的气氛中。
