    The National Representative Conference of Women Activists in Socialist Construction is a grand gathering of outstanding women representatives from across the country, and a review of the various achievements of women in the revolutionary and construction endeavors. We salute the women activists participating in this conference, and we salute the women across the nation who are working diligently on all fronts of socialist construction. We warmly congratulate the successful conclusion of this conference!

    In the past year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the people of the whole country, brimming with energy, have achieved remarkable accomplishments in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward on all fronts. These achievements are inseparable from the efforts of women of all ethnic groups across the country. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the basic realization of people's communes in rural areas, the social status and spiritual outlook of women in our country have undergone tremendous changes. People's communes in rural areas and many cities have established a large number of collective living welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens, and homes for the elderly, which have transformed or are transforming a large part of the heavy housework into social undertakings. The broad masses of women have reduced their housework and freed up a lot of time to devote to various social labors. On the agricultural front, women have joined men in participating in agricultural labor such as opening mountains and controlling water, planting trees and afforestation, deep plowing and close planting, and improving soil. Women have also undertaken the main part of field management for major crops such as wheat, cotton, and rice, as well as raising pigs, accumulating fertilizer, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. On the industrial front, women have participated in the labor of various light industries, heavy industries, and transportation industries. In the upsurge of the whole people running industry, with steel as the key link, millions of women participated in the iron and steel army. In the Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production, many women, unafraid of high mountains and long distances, unafraid of the cold weather, camped on high mountains and set up villages in the fields, demonstrating a noble style of daring to think and daring to act, and of being brave and strong. They used both their hands and brains to grow high-yield fields, worked hard and skillfully to produce high-quality steel. In cultural, educational, health undertakings, as well as in canteens, nurseries, commerce and other collective welfare and service industries, women have already played a great role. In these works, women have shown their unique strengths, being considerate and meticulous when dealing with people, and patient, thorough, diligent and thrifty when dealing with things. Many women started from scratch when running canteens and nurseries, showing great enthusiasm, so that the labor army on the industrial and agricultural fronts could eat well and be full after work, and family members, both old and young, could be properly cared for, which further encouraged and consolidated people's labor enthusiasm.

    As women have greatly reduced housework and joined the ranks of production in the Great Leap Forward, their socialist and communist consciousness has been increasing day by day. Family relationships have also undergone great changes, with families being united, harmonious, and cheerful. In the collective labor training, a large number of women activists who are both red and expert have emerged. The leap forward development of economic and cultural undertakings and the communization have further liberated women; the liberation of women's labor force and the emergence of a large number of women activists have powerfully promoted the leap forward of various construction undertakings.

    Next year, our economic and cultural undertakings will continue to develop at a high speed, and all walks of life will need a large amount of labor force, and women, this labor army, will need to fight hard. Women should be more energetic than this year. In the iron and steel industry, the machinery industry, the transportation industry, and other industrial construction, there are many jobs that women can do, and can do well. In the future, women should continue to play a role in this regard. In cultural, educational, health, commercial, collective living welfare undertakings, and other service undertakings, women should participate more actively, and should gradually achieve female substitution for male in all work positions suitable for women, so that the entire social labor force can be more rationally arranged.

    Since the Great Leap Forward, people have broken the superstitious ideas that women can't do this or can't do that. Facts have proven that in all aspects such as industry, agriculture, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, women can do anything, and they do it very well. Wherever the Party points, they go, and wherever their work is needed, they rush to it. They are truly full of energy and work selflessly, and in the future, it is still necessary to promote their spirit of hard struggle and selflessness. However, the more enthusiastic and hardworking women are in participating in labor, the more leaders at all levels should pay attention to caring for women's health and safety. Labor and rest should be combined rhythmically, with work and leisure. Special attention should also be paid to the physiological characteristics of women, and women should be given relatively sufficient nutrition and rest during pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. Paying attention to these special circumstances of women is not only about caring for women's health, but also about the issue of women's long-term labor, and also about the growth of our next generation.

    Women's large-scale participation in social labor has promoted the development of collective living welfare undertakings, and the consolidation and development of collective living welfare undertakings has encouraged women to participate more actively in social labor. At present, in the stage of vigorously consolidating people's communes, it is necessary to run more and better collective living welfare undertakings. Collective living welfare undertakings are undertakings for all the people, and require everyone's efforts and active participation; some industries, such as nurseries, kindergartens, and public canteens, especially need women to participate actively and become the main force. Why? Because these are undertakings that are particularly related to women's vital interests. If nurseries are not well run, mothers cannot engage in production without worries; if public canteens and nurseries cannot be consolidated and improved, women's participation in social labor will be greatly limited. Precisely because of this, women should become the most active supporters of collective living welfare undertakings, actively participate in these undertakings, and become activists in running these undertakings well. However, many women have not realized the great significance of this work and are not very willing to do these jobs. They feel that they are doing these things at home, and who would want to cook and take care of children all day long when participating in social labor? This is an idea that underestimates housework. Historically, housework has always been indispensable for the development of social production and for the survival and prosperity of the nation, and has always had social value. Because labor was underestimated in the old society, housework was also underestimated. Moreover, when housework is carried out in separate households, it is trivial, and its social significance is easily overlooked. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, housework, like other labor, has been valued, and many women have worked hard to do a good job in housework, and have played a positive role in supporting socialist construction. At present, our widespread establishment of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens and other collective living welfare organizations is not to deny the significance of housework, but to transform the original scattered housework into a social collective undertaking both in form and in substance. In this way, everyone's life can be arranged better, and thousands of women can be drawn to participate in social labor, and women's active role in socialist construction can be brought into fuller play. Therefore, we hope that women, especially the activists among them, will regard collective living welfare undertakings as their own vital undertakings, and regard participating in these works as a glorious, heroic and lofty undertaking.

    Some comrades may feel that your emphasis on collective living welfare undertakings means that there will be no housework in the future, or even no family life? Of course not. Although the degree of socialization of housework will continue to increase, housework will still not be completely eliminated in the future, and this kind of housework will also be pleasant labor. Doing a good job in this housework is also essential for increasing family happiness. Family life in the future will not only not be abolished, but will also be more beautiful and happier than at any time in history. The family life we need is a family life of equality between men and women, respect for the old and love for the young, and unity and harmony. After collective living welfare undertakings are established and women participate more in social labor, family life has indeed undergone great changes, but with the continuous improvement of social material life and cultural life, and with the continuous improvement of people's communist consciousness, what is destroyed is only the unreasonable patriarchal system left over from history, and what is destroyed is only the family life that binds women's wisdom and wears down women's energy, and what is gained is a more democratic and united, more beautiful and happier family life.

    In order to play a greater role in socialist construction, women must strive to study politics, diligently study technology, learn culture, and improve their ability to build socialism. At present, a socialist and communist education movement is being carried out throughout the country. Women should actively participate in this movement, and participate in solving various important issues in the commune through the method of great contending, great blooming, and great debate, further enhance their political consciousness, firmly establish the idea of ​​loving the commune, loving the collective, and loving the country, and establish a complete collectiveist and patriotic viewpoint. Women should also strive to study technology in order to improve their ability to build socialism. Many women have just stepped onto the economic and cultural construction posts, and are relatively unfamiliar with the work they are engaged in; even the work they were more familiar with in the past, such as cooking and taking care of children, is very different from running canteens and running nurseries today, and it has put forward many new requirements for women. Not only that, in my country's economic and cultural construction, science and technology are constantly advancing. To promote the development of production, we cannot rely solely on labor enthusiasm, but must also master technology. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly study scientific and technical knowledge. To learn politics and technology, we must learn culture. Without culture, political level and technical knowledge will be limited. In order to cultivate women faster so that they can better shoulder their work, leaders should pay more attention and care in this regard.

    Women activists from all over the motherland and from all fronts, you have already made many achievements in national construction and collective living welfare undertakings. Today, you are gathered together in our great capital, exchanging advanced experiences and learning from each other. After this gathering, we believe that you will continue to play a leading, backbone, and bridging role on the socialist construction front and among the women masses, and make greater achievements in building our better life!

### 向建设社会主义的妇女积极分子致敬

    向建设社会主义的妇女积极分子致敬
    全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议是全国妇女优秀代表的大会师，是全国妇女在革命和建设事业中各项成就的检阅大会。我们向参加这次大会的妇女积极分子致敬，向社会主义建设各个战线上努力工作的全国妇女致敬，我们热烈地祝贺这次大会的胜利成功！
    一年来，全国人民在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，干劲冲天，在各个战线上全面大跃进，获得了惊人的成就。这些成就，和全国各族妇女的努力是分不开的。全国大跃进以来，特别是农村基本实现人民公社化以后，我国妇女的社会地位和精神面貌发生了巨大变化。农村人民公社和许多城市，大办托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂、敬老院等集体生活福利事业，使很大一部分繁重的家务劳动已经变成或者正在变成社会事业，广大妇女减少了家务劳动，腾出很多时间，投入各项社会劳动。在农业战线上，妇女同男子一起参加了开山治水、植树造林、深耕密植、改良土壤等农事劳动。妇女还担负了小麦、棉花、水稻等主要农作物的田间管理和养猪、积肥、防治病虫害等劳动的主要部分。在工业战线上，妇女参加了各种轻工业、重工业和交通运输业的劳动；在全民大办工业，以钢为纲的生产高潮中，数以千百万计的妇女参加了钢铁大军。在工农业生产大跃进中，许多妇女不怕山高路远，不怕天寒地冻，在高山上扎营，在田野里下寨，表现出敢想敢干、英勇坚强的崇高风格。她们手脑并用种出了高额丰产田，苦干巧干炼出了优质钢。在文教、卫生事业以及食堂、托儿所、商业等集体福利和服务性行业中，妇女已经发挥了很大的作用。在这些工作中，妇女更表现出了自己所特有的长处，在待人时关怀备至，细致周到，在对事时耐心周密，克勤克俭。许多妇女在办食堂、托儿所的时候，白手起家，从无到有，表现了高度的热情，使工农业战线上的劳动大军，在劳动之余能吃好吃饱，使家人老幼都有妥善的照料，这更鼓舞和巩固了人们的劳动热情。
    随着妇女大量减少家务劳动，参加了大跃进的生产行列，妇女的社会主义、共产主义觉悟日益提高。家庭关系也发生了很大的变化，在家庭里一家大小团结和睦、心情舒畅。在集体劳动的锻炼中出现了大批又红又专的妇女积极分子。经济文化事业的飞跃发展和公社化进一步解放了妇女；妇女劳动力的解放，妇女积极分子的大量涌现又有力地推动了各项建设事业的跃进。
    明年，我们的经济文教事业都将继续高速度地发展，各行各业，都需要大量的劳动力，都需要妇女这支劳动大军艰苦奋战。妇女们应该比今年的干劲更大。在钢铁工业、机械工业、交通事业和其他各项工业建设当中，妇女能够做的工作很多，也能够做得很好，今后，妇女还要继续在这方面发挥作用。在文教、卫生、商业、集体生活福利事业和其他各项服务性事业方面，妇女更应该积极参加，并且要在所有适合妇女担任的工作岗位上，逐步作到以女代男，使整个社会劳动力能够得到更加合理的安排。
    大跃进以来，人们打破了妇女这也不能做、那也不能做的迷信思想。事实证明：在工业、农业、商业、文化教育事业等各个方面，妇女什么都能做，而且都做得很好。党指向哪里，他们就到哪里，什么工作需要她们，她们就奔向哪里去。真是干劲冲天，忘我劳动，今后还必需发扬她们这种艰苦奋斗和大公无私的精神。但是，当妇女越是热情、越是努力参加劳动的时候，各级领导者越要注意关怀妇女的健康和安全。要把劳动和休息有节奏地结合起来，有劳有逸。还要特别照顾到妇女生理上的特点，在妇女怀孕期、产期、哺乳期，给以比较充分的营养和休息。注意照顾妇女的这些特殊情况，不仅仅是关心妇女身体健康，还关系到广大妇女持久劳动的问题，还关系到我们下一代的成长。
    妇女大规模地参加社会劳动，促进了集体生活福利事业的发展，集体生活福利事业的巩固和发展，又鼓舞妇女更加积极地参加社会劳动。目前，在大力巩固人民公社的阶段，需要把集体生活福利事业办得更多更好。集体生活福利事业是全民的事业，需要大家努力，积极参加；其中有些行业比如托儿所、幼儿园和公共食堂等，特别需要妇女积极参加成为主力。为什么呢？因为这是特别有关妇女切身利益的事业，如果托儿所办得不好，妈妈们就不能毫无牵挂地去进行生产；如果公共食堂和托儿所不能巩固和提高，妇女参加社会劳动就要受到很大限制。正因为如此，妇女应当成为集体生活福利事业的最积极的支持者，踊跃地参加这些事业，成为办好这些事业的积极分子。但是有不少妇女却没有认识到这项工作的重大意义，不大愿意做这些工作。她们觉得在家就是干这些事，参加社会劳动了，谁还愿意成天做饭带娃娃。这是一种轻视家务劳动的想法。在历史上，家务劳动对于社会生产的发展，对于民族的生存和繁荣，从来就是不可缺少的，从来就是有社会价值的。因为在旧社会里轻视劳动，所以也轻视家务劳动。而且当家务劳动分散在一家一户进行的时候，是琐碎的，它的社会意义也容易被忽视。中华人民共和国成立以后，家务劳动和其他劳动一样受到了重视，许多妇女努力搞好家务劳动，对支援社会主义建设更是起了积极作用。目前我们普遍地设立公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利组织，并不是否定家务劳动的意义，而是把原来分散的家务劳动，从形式上和实质上都变成了社会的集体事业。这样，就可以把大家的生活安排得更好，就可以抽调出成千上万的妇女参加社会劳动，更充分地发挥妇女在社会主义建设中的积极作用。因此，我们希望妇女们，特别是她们中间的积极分子，把集体生活福利事业当成自己的切身事业，把参加这些工作当成光荣、豪迈和崇高的事业。
    有些同志会觉得，你们这样强调集体生活福利事业，是不是以后就没有家务劳动了，甚至没有家庭生活了？当然不是的。尽管家务劳动社会化的程度还要日益增长，但是，家务劳动今后仍然不会完全没有，这种家务劳动也将是愉快的劳动，做好这些家务劳动，对增进家庭幸福也是不可少的。今后的家庭生活不只不会取消，而且还会比历史上任何时期更加美满更加幸福。我们需要的家庭生活是男女平等、尊老爱幼、团结和睦的家庭生活。办了集体生活福利事业，妇女更多地参加了社会劳动以后，家庭生活的确发生了很大的变化，但是，随着社会物质生活和文化生活的不断提高，随着人们共产主义觉悟的不断提高，受到破坏的只是历史上遗留下来的不合理的家长制，受到破坏的只会是那种束缚妇女智慧和消磨妇女精力的家庭生活，而得到的却是更加民主团结的、更加美好幸福的家庭生活。
    为了在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用，妇女必须努力学习政治，刻苦钻研技术，学习文化，提高建设社会主义的本领。目前，全国各地正在开展社会主义、共产主义的教育运动。妇女应当积极地参加这个运动，通过大鸣大放大辩论的方法，参与解决公社中的各项重要问题，进一步提高政治觉悟，巩固地树立热爱公社、热爱集体、热爱国家的思想，确立完整的集体主义和爱国主义的观点。妇女还应该努力钻研技术，才能提高建设社会主义的本领。许多妇女都是刚刚走上经济建设和文化建设岗位，对自己所从事的工作，还比较生疏；即使过去比较熟悉的工作，如作饭、带孩子，和今天办食堂、办托儿所也有了很大不同，它对妇女提出了很多新的要求。不仅如此，在我国经济文化建设上，科学技术不断前进，要促进生产的发展，不能只凭劳动热情，还必须掌握技术。因此，必须认真地钻研科学技术知识。要学政治，学技术，必须学文化，没有文化，政治水平和技术知识都将受到限制。为了更快的培养妇女，使她们能更好地担负起自己的工作，领导者在这方面应该注意给予更多的关怀和照顾。
    来自祖国各地和各个战线上的妇女积极分子同志们，你们已经在国家建设和集体生活福利事业中做出了许多成绩。今天，你们在我国伟大的首都，济济一堂，交流先进经验，相互学习。经过这次集会，我们相信，你们一定会在社会主义建设战线上，在妇女群众中继续起带头、骨干、桥梁的作用，为建设我们更美好的生活，取得更大的成就！
