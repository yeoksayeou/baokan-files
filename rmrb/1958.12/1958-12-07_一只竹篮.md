    A Bamboo Basket
    Yatang
    A bamboo basket in the home of Chen Youxin of the Dongfeng Commune in WuJi County, Hebei Province, has been passed down through three generations and is still in use today.
    Grandma used this basket,
    Leading Dad to beg for food.
    Mother used this basket,
    A basket of wild vegetables to survive the famine years.
    Sister-in-law used this basket,
    Golden rice was delivered to the fields.
    Today I carry this basket,
    To the commune canteen to receive steamed rolls.
    Eating steamed rolls, thinking of our benefactor,
    It is the Party that removed the roots of our poor fate.

    一只竹篮
    雅堂
    河北无极县东风公社陈有信家中的一只竹篮留传了三辈，到现在仍用着。
    奶奶用过这只篮，
    领着爹爹讨过饭。
    母亲用过这只篮，
    篮篮野菜度荒年。
    嫂嫂用过这只篮，
    金黄米饭送田间。
    我今挎起这只篮，
    公社食堂领花卷。
    吃花卷，想恩人，
    是党除了穷命根。
