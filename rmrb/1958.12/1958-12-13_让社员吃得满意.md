    Make Commune Members Satisfied with Their Meals

    I am the cook at the Yukadi Village canteen, Xinzhai Township, Jinping County, Yunnan.

    Usually, I cook three kinds of rice according to the different needs of the four types of people: young, middle-aged, old, and children: soft rice for the elderly and children, hard rice for the young, and rice that is neither hard nor soft for the middle-aged. Some people like to eat glutinous rice, and some people like to eat regular rice, so I cook a little glutinous rice for both breakfast and lunch, so that everyone can eat as freely as they would at home. According to the vegetables brought in by the commune members, I match them up so that everyone eats something different each meal. Sometimes I also try to find time to cut bamboo shoots for everyone to cook, so that everyone doesn't just eat plain rice. I considered that everyone works hard all day and doesn't get enough oil, so I suggested that everyone contribute chickens to have a good meal once a week. The commune members were all happy to hear this, and they brought many chickens at once, and even sent eggs. Since then, the variety has become more and more diverse, and the commune members are eating well and are full, and I am getting more and more energetic.

    There was an old man in the village, Gao Shunsheng, who was afraid that his old illness would recur if he ate sow meat in the canteen, so he cooked at home alone. I thought, "How can we let the old man worry about such a big family alone? I should take care of this old man." I went to see him and assured him: I will cook whatever he wants to eat, and if he can't eat something, I'll cook it in a separate pot, and said that this is what I should do. Old man Gao joined the canteen. He likes to eat peanuts, so I cook peanuts for him. When there is sow meat in the pot, I cook in a separate pot. If the old people can't chew the peanuts, I grind them into powder for them. They are very satisfied and treat me like their own daughter. Usually, I have to cook rice before dawn every day; if someone wants to travel, I cook for them in the middle of the night; the people at the iron smelting furnace take food three days at a time, I dry the food for them; at night, I put the children to sleep before going to wash the dishes, wash the vegetables, and cut the vegetables. I seize the time to study culture when I have a little time. Now I have learned to keep accounts, which makes my work more convenient.

    In order to make the canteen better and make everyone concentrate on production, I often ask everyone to give me their opinions. If I can improve something, I will improve it immediately; for some problems, I report to the leaders and try to do it according to the requirements of the commune members. The commune members also care about me very much.

    让社员吃得满意
    我是云南金平县新寨乡鱼卡底村食堂的炊事员。
    平时我根据青年、中年、老年、娃娃四种人不同的要求，做三种饭：软的老人娃娃吃，硬的青年吃，不硬不软的中年人吃。有人爱吃糯米，有人爱吃饭米，我就在早饭、午饭两餐都加煮一点糯米饭，让大家就像在自己家里一样随心吃。根据社员凑来的菜，搭配起来，让大家吃得一顿不同一顿。有时我还想办法抽时间去砍竹笋给大家做菜，总不叫大家吃白饭。我考虑大家辛苦一天，吃的油水不够，就建议大家凑鸡来，一个星期打一次牙祭，社员们听了个个高兴，一下子提来很多鸡，并且连鸡蛋也送来了。从此，花样品种越来越多，社员们吃得饱吃得好，我自己也越干越起劲。
    村里有个高顺生老爹怕入了食堂吃母猪肉旧病复发，一人在家做饭，我想：“团团的一大家人，怎能让他老人家独个去操心，我应该照管这位老人。”我去看他，对他保证：想吃什么做什么，不能吃的隔锅煮，并说这是我应该做的。高老爹入了食堂，他喜欢吃花生，我就煮花生给他吃，遇到锅里煮母猪肉我就隔锅煮。老人们吃花生嚼不动我就给他们舂成粉粉。他们很满意，把我当做自己的姑娘。平时每天早上天不亮我就要煮熟饭；有人要上路，我就半夜做给他们吃；炼铁炉上的三天来拿一次粮，我给他们晒好干粮；晚上，我把孩子哄睡了才去洗碗筷、洗菜、切菜。有一点时间我就抓紧学文化，现在我已学会了记账，工作更方便了。
    为了把食堂搞得更好，使大家一心生产，我经常都请大家对我提意见，能改进的我马上就改；有些问题，我向领导反映，尽量的按照社员的要求去做。社员也很关心体贴我。
