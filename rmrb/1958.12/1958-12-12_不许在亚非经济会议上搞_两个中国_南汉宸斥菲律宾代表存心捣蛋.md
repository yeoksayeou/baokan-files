Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th – Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Economic Conference, issued a statement here tonight, condemning A. I. Espejo, a member of the Philippine delegation, for playing the trick of creating "two Chinas."
	Head of the Chinese delegation Nan Hanchen said: The Asian-African Economic Conference is proceeding very smoothly. Suddenly, Mr. Espejo, a member of the Philippine delegation, stated at a press conference in Cairo that his delegation had requested the Chairman of the conference to invite the so-called Nationalist China to participate in the next Asian-African conference.
	I think it is necessary to issue the following statement:
	"Mr. Espejo, you are simply too foolish, because the moment you open your mouth, people all over the world will see that you came to Cairo not to participate in the Asian-African Economic Conference, not to promote Asian-African economic cooperation, but to play the trick of creating 'two Chinas.'
	"Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan! This is our sovereignty. Outsiders must not interfere. All those who play the trick of creating 'two Chinas' will surely fail; Eisenhower has failed, Dulles has failed, and Mr. Espejo, you will be no exception.
	"Our Chinese delegation believes that the Asian-African Economic Conference is an important conference to promote the economic development of the people of Asian and African countries. We hope that all those participating in the Asian-African Economic Conference can, in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation between the people of Asian and African countries, help make this conference a success. The Chinese delegation will continue to work to ensure the success of the conference. If anyone attempts to undermine the unity and cooperation of the people of Asian and African countries, let the people of all Asian and African countries abandon him."

    不许在亚非经济会议上搞“两个中国”
    南汉宸斥菲律宾代表存心捣蛋
    新华社开罗10日电  出席亚非经济会议的中国代表团团长南汉宸今天晚上在这里发表谈话，谴责菲律宾代表团团员阿·伊·伊西普玩弄制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    南汉宸团长的谈话说：亚非经济会议进行得很顺利。突然之间，菲律宾代表团团员伊西普先生在开罗的一次记者招待会上表示，他的代表团已经向会议主席提出要求，认为应该邀请所谓国民党中国参加下一届亚非会议。
    我认为有必要发表下列声明：
    “伊西普先生，你简直太愚蠢了，因为你一开口，全世界人民就都看到：你到开罗来不是为了参加亚非经济会议，不是为了促进亚非经济合作，而是为了玩弄制造‘两个中国’的阴谋。
    “台湾自古以来就是中国的领土。台湾问题是中国的内政。中国人民一定要解放台湾！这是我们的主权。外人不得干涉。一切玩弄制造‘两个中国’这种阴谋的人都一定会遭到失败；艾森豪威尔失败了，杜勒斯失败了，而伊西普先生，你也不会例外。
    “我们中国代表团认为亚非经济会议是促进亚非各国人民的经济发展的一次重要会议。我们希望一切参加亚非经济会议的人能够本着亚非各国人民团结合作的精神，帮助使这次会议获得成功。中国代表团将继续为争取会议的成功而努力。假如有谁企图破坏亚非各国人民的团结和合作，就让所有亚非国家的人民抛弃他。”
