In the Fujian front, the heroic story of a brave pilot from the People's Air Force is widely spread among soldiers and civilians. This pilot, participating in combat for the first time, faced an aerial battle where his war eagle – a fighter jet – sustained thirty-one points of damage to its fuselage. Despite this severe damage, he skillfully piloted the aircraft, successfully repelling three enemy attacks and severely damaging one enemy plane. He then safely returned to base and landed. The young pilot, Han Yuyan, is the creator of this rare miracle.

On the afternoon of September 18th, as Han Yuyan and his comrades were flying their silver war eagles through layers of clouds on a patrol mission over the Fujian front, eight enemy aircraft suddenly appeared from the southeast, recklessly attempting a surprise attack. Han Yuyan, participating in his first battle, immediately obeyed the orders of the squadron leader and jettisoned the auxiliary fuel tank to prepare for combat. However, before Han Yuyan could turn his aircraft, four cunning enemy planes rapidly approached from behind, attacking him relentlessly. One enemy plane even moved in front of him, attempting to cut off his path. Although Han Yuyan knew his plane was seriously damaged, he was filled with anger and immediately aimed at the enemy plane, unleashing a barrage of shells. The enemy plane was hit and forced to flee at low altitude, but it was ultimately caught and shot down into the sea by Han Yuyan's comrades.

At this time, Han Yuyan's war eagle had fallen to an altitude of five thousand meters, but he was determined to find a way to fly his beloved aircraft back. Then, two more enemy planes successively attacked him. After evading an attack from one enemy plane, Han Yuyan immediately locked the aiming reticle on another and fired a volley of shells, severely damaging it. The enemy plane then fled to the sea in a wretched state. Han Yuyan, amidst the anxious anticipation of his comrades, calmly and skillfully piloted his wounded silver swallow back to base and landed safely. (Attached image)

    顽强的战鹰
    在福建前线军民中，到处传扬着一个英雄的故事。有一个第一次参加战斗的神勇的人民空军飞行员，在高空战斗中，虽然驾驶的战鹰——歼击机机身负伤三十一处，但是他仍然驾驶着这架负了重伤的战鹰，先后打退了敌机三次袭击。并把一架敌机打成重伤，他自己安全返航着陆了。创造这个罕见的奇迹的，就是青年飞行员韩玉砚。
    9月18日下午，正当韩玉砚和他的几位战友驾驶着银色的战鹰，穿越朵朵云层，飞翔在福建前线上空巡逻的时候，忽然有八架敌机从东南方向没头没脑地向他们窜来，企图乘机偷袭。第一次参加战斗的韩玉砚立即遵照带队长机的命令，丢下副油箱准备迎击敌机。但是韩玉砚尚未掉转机头，马上就有四架狡猾的敌机从后面向他急速飞来，不顾死活地向他攻击，有一架敌机窜到他的前方企图截住他的去路。这时韩玉砚虽然知道自己的飞机已负重伤，但他怒从心头起，立即对准这架敌机发炮猛击，打得这架敌机低飞逃窜，但是终究被韩玉砚的战友追上打到大海里去了。
    这时候，韩玉砚驾驶的战鹰也掉到五千公尺高空，但他决心想办法把心爱的战鹰驾回去。这时，又有两架敌机先后向他冲来。韩玉砚在避过一架敌机的袭击以后，立即把瞄准光圈套住了另一架敌机，狠狠地射出一串炮弹，把这架敌机打成重伤，狼狈地向海面逃窜。韩玉砚也在战友们焦急的等待中，镇静巧妙地驾着负伤的银燕着陆了。（附图片）
