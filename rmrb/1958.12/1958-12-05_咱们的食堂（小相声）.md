A: Today, I'm going to tell you a crosstalk. Crosstalk is easy with two people, but today I'm doing a solo crosstalk, which isn't so easy.
B: Why are you talking so fast?
A: You mean the cafeteria? Our cafeteria is so good, I can't stop talking about it.
B: You're making trouble!
A: The noodles with gravy? Our cafeteria has a Fatty Liu, who can stretch three or four pounds of noodles at once.
B: You're interrupting me!
A: Oh, making dumplings. The other day, we had a big meal, and we all worked at night, chopping the filling, kneading the dough. The next day, everyone ate dumplings! We made ten thousand and five hundred of them, which is no small feat.
B: What are you talking about?
A: Oh, drinking millet tea? The cafeteria makes that too. It has pepper salt, and sesame paste on top. It's very cold, and a bowl is so warming. I even drink two bowls.
B: You're going against me!
A: What is rice with toppings? Hey, underneath is rice, and on top is a soup and vegetables, it’s both rice and vegetables. It’s really good.
B: You've been talking for a long time, I'm also a crosstalk performer.
A: Cleaning? The cafeteria has a slogan: kill a fly and eat for free. It's really clean inside!
B: I'm saying, can you hear me clearly?
A: Oh, Mu Guiying: They are really capable, working day and night. There is an elder sister whose attitude is very good. She will tell you everything you want to eat. Even if I don't eat, I'm already eighty percent full.
B: Wait a minute!
A: Braised pancakes? Great, there are two aunties, braised pancakes are their specialty!
B: Why is your voice so loud?
A: Oh! Pengsi cake? The cafeteria has it! There are also green and red silk square pieces, which are very beautiful!
B: You're relying on me now.
A: What about stir-fried dishes? There are many kinds of stir-fried dishes!
　　(Listing dishes)……
B: I see you're tired from talking, and thirsty. The cafeteria has hot dumplings.
A: Where to eat?
B: You heard that, right!
A: Sigh, I'm overjoyed by our cafeteria!

    乙：您说话为什么这样忙啊？
    甲：你说食堂哪？咱们的食堂可好哩，说都说不完。
    乙：您在这捣乱！
    甲：打卤面呀？咱们食堂有个刘胖子，一抻面就是三四斤面。
    乙：您跟我打搅啊！

    乙：您这啥跟啥呀？
