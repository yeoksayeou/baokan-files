Water buffaloes can also produce one calf per year
Dongliu County's water buffalo breeding rate sets national record

    (Our report) Anhui Province's Dongliu County has broken the age-old rule of "slow water buffalo breeding, two calves every three years" and has raised a red flag in water buffalo breeding work. The county has 3,917 eligible female water buffaloes, and in the first eight months of this year, 1,317 calves have already been born, and 2,987 are pregnant (including those that gave birth this year and became pregnant again). Another 733 calves can be born within the year, achieving the requirement of full pregnancy for livestock production. "High-yielding cows" that give birth to one calf every year for three to five years, or even more than ten years, can be found in every agricultural cooperative in the county. A female water buffalo in the Chengdong Cooperative once created a high-yield record of giving birth to 19 calves in 20 consecutive years.

    In the past, water buffalo breeding in Dongliu County was also very slow. According to a 1953 survey, the empty pregnancy rate of female cows was as high as 73%. In 1954, the county suffered a once-in-a-century flood, and about 15% of the draft cattle were lost, which seriously affected agricultural production. Since then, the Dongliu County Committee of the Communist Party of China has begun to pay attention to water buffalo breeding. The Party committees at all levels criticized the erroneous ideas of waiting for mechanization, "self-breeding cattle is a distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst," and "slow water buffalo breeding" that existed among cadres and the masses, and repeatedly educated the broad masses of cadres and the masses by calculating the three accounts of "grain production reduction due to lack of cattle," "grain production increase due to breeding cattle," and "large income from combining agriculture and animal husbandry." At the same time, leadership was strengthened organizationally, and livestock production organizations were established at all levels. The deputy secretary of the Party committee took personal charge, cadres were assigned to specific areas, breeding tasks were assigned to teams, and special personnel were responsible. Systems for cattle raising and protection, and breeding rewards were established, with monthly comparisons between cooperatives and regular inspections. By 1957, the county's water buffaloes had increased by 58.14% compared to 1954, which was more than ten times higher than the national water buffalo increase rate during the same period.

    Dongliu County has created and comprehensively promoted several major technical measures in breeding water buffaloes. The first is to implement "hot mating." Water buffaloes take eleven months to be born in the mother's body, so whenever a cow is less than a month after giving birth, when the first estrus period appears, it must be mated, otherwise it will not meet the requirement of one calf per year. Implementing artificial estrus to eliminate "barren cows" that have not given birth for many years is also an important part of ensuring the comprehensive high yield of water buffaloes. The county uses local methods such as loach blood and jujube bark to induce estrus in cows, and the effect is very good, and it has promoted 173 "barren cows" to become pregnant and give birth. All localities have also strengthened the care of pregnant cows and have issued "four preventions" regulations to prevent eating frosted grass, prevent sharp turns, prevent hitting cold whips, and prevent climbing steep slopes. As the production period approaches, constantly reducing the service of pregnant cows also reduces the incidence of miscarriage and improves the survival rate. (Shi Zhengzhang)

### 水牛也能年产一头  东流县水牛繁殖率创全国纪录

    水牛也能年产一头
    东流县水牛繁殖率创全国纪录
    本报讯  安徽省东流县打破了千百年来“水牛繁殖慢，三年生两头”的老规矩，树起了一面水牛繁殖工作的红旗。这个县有适龄母水牛三千九百一十七头，今年头八个月就已生小牛一千三百一十七头，并有二千九百八十七头怀了孕（包括今年生小牛后又怀孕的母牛在内），年内还能生小牛七百三十三头，实现了全部满怀的畜牧丰产要求。连续三五年甚至十几年，每年生殖一头牛的“丰产牛”，在全县每个农业社都有。城东社一头母水牛曾创造了二十年连续生了十九胎的高产纪录。
    东流县过去水牛繁殖也是很慢的。据1953年调查，母牛空怀率高达73％。1954年遭受了百年未有的大水灾，耕牛损失了15％左右，严重地影响着农业生产。从此，中共东流县委就开始重视水牛繁殖工作。各级党委对干部和群众中存在着的等待机械化、“缺牛自繁是远水不能救近火”以及“水牛繁殖慢”等错误思想，开展了批判，并且通过算“缺牛粮食减产”、“繁殖牛粮食增产”和“农牧结合收入大”等三笔账，反复教育广大干部和群众。同时，在组织上加强了领导，层层建立了畜牧生产机构。党委副书记亲自抓，干部分片包干，繁殖任务分配到队，专人负责。建立了耕牛养护、奖励繁殖等制度，社社月月评比，定期检查。到1957年，这个县的水牛就比1954年增加了58.14％，比同期全国水牛增殖率高出十倍以上。
    东流县在繁殖水牛中创造和全面推广了几个主要技术措施。首先是实行“热配”。水牛在母体内要十一个月才能出生，所以每当母牛产后不到一个月，第一次发情期出现时，就要给它交配，如果错过时机，就达不到一年生一头的要求。实行人工催情，消灭多年不生育的
  “漂?牛”，也是保证水牛全面丰产的重要一环。这个县用黄鳝血、枣树皮等土办法，给母牛催情，效果很好，已促使一百七十三头“漂?牛”怀孕生育。各地还加强了孕牛的养护，订出了防吃霜草、防转急弯、防打冷鞭、防爬陡坡的“四防”规定。随着产期临近，不断减轻孕牛的使役，也减少了流产现象，提高了成活率。  （石正章）
