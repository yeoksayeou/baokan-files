Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: A massive commercial transportation blitz has begun today. After nearly a week of material preparation, over 400,000 tons of non-staple food, industrial raw materials, and daily-use industrial products are now concentrated at stations across the country awaiting transport. At 6:00 PM today, the national railway transportation departments began dispatching these goods to urban and rural areas.

In order to guarantee the victory of this transportation blitz, the Ministry of Railways held a telephone conference on the evening of the 9th, inspecting the state of preparedness and requiring railway departments in all regions to complete this transportation blitz as a political task. While ensuring the coal supply for the eighteen key steel enterprises and Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai, as well as handling import and export material transportation, the greatest effort should be made to carry out this transportation blitz. The Ministry of Railways requires all railway bureaus to guarantee the completion of the car loading quotas determined by the provincial transportation headquarters, and to strive to exceed them. Market-urgent materials arriving at stations should be transported as soon as they arrive, and perishable goods should be given priority. The Ministry of Railways also requires all regions to organize the loading, unloading, and handling of materials, fully tap transportation potential, and achieve even greater results in this transportation blitz.

Party and government leading departments in various regions also attach great importance to this transportation blitz. Leading cadres of Party committees and administrative offices at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels are personally taking charge, deploying forces, and making emergency arrangements. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on the 5th. Hu Kaiming, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor, pointed out the importance of this transportation blitz and required at least one member of the Standing Committee of each Party committee to lead this work. Currently, leadership organizations for the transportation blitz have been established in all prefectures and counties of the province. Hui Yuyu, Governor of Jiangsu Province, proposed at a provincial broadcast conference on the 6th that December should be designated as a national transportation blitz month, requiring "doubling the volume of transport, transporting 330,000 tons per day." The Hunan Provincial Party Committee decided to allocate half of the province's automobile transportation capacity to commodity transportation during this period. The Minister of Finance and Trade Department of the Provincial Party Committee and the three heads and deputy heads of the Commercial Department have personally led more than 400 cadres, setting out on different routes to inspect and assist various regions in organizing material allocation.

Under the organization and leadership of Party committees and transportation headquarters in various regions, in recent days, the roads and rivers leading to the railways have been filled with vehicles and boats loaded with materials, and short-distance transportation has seen an unprecedentedly busy scene. More than three million people in Hunan Province have participated in short-distance transportation. The commercial and transportation departments of the province have closely cooperated, making full use of empty return vehicles and boats, and mobilizing the masses to rush the transport of large quantities of materials. Within a few days, various living and production materials totaling 130,000 to 140,000 tons were concentrated on the front line (major docks, stations), and materials transported to the second line (rural concentration points) also exceeded 90,000 tons. Party committees and transportation headquarters at all levels in Shandong Province have mobilized a large number of automobiles, wooden sailboats, cattle, and horse carts to join the battle. A blitz transportation team in Qingdao (including 1,104 people, 336 wooden carts, and 47 automobiles), after completing the blitz transportation task from the 1st to the 3rd, took a short break and then joined this blitz transportation. Currently, more than 50,000 tons of cotton, tobacco, pigs, and non-staple food have been concentrated along the railway lines in Shandong Province. Sichuan Province has rushed to transport about 200,000 live pigs to stations and ports for transport. The province has also processed more than 20,000 tons of salted cured meat, preparing to transport it to Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, and other places. (Attached picture)

    全国商业运输突击战开始
    大路上车辆不断  河道上船只相连
    让城乡商品畅流  让工农携手跃进
    新华社10日讯  一个声势浩大的商业运输突击战已经在今天开始。经过将近一个星期的物资准备工作，目前集中在各地车站上待运的副食品、工业原料和日用工业品已达四十多万吨。今天下午六时，全国铁路运输部门开始把这些物资向城乡发运。
    铁道部为了保证这次突击运输的胜利，在9日晚召开电话会议，检查了准备工作情况，要求各地铁路部门把这次突击运输当作一项政治任务来完成。要在保证十八个钢铁重点企业和湖北、湖南、广东、广西、上海市的用煤以及做好进出口物资运输的前提下，尽最大力量做好这一次突击运输工作。铁道部要求各路局对于各省运输指挥部决定的装车数要保证完成，并且争取超过。凡到站的市场急需物资应做到随到随运，易腐易烂的商品更应优先运输。铁道部还要求各地组织好物资的装卸和搬运工作，充分挖掘运输潜力，使这次突击运输取得更大的成绩。
    各地党政领导部门对于这次突击运输也十分重视，许多省、专区、县的党政负责干部都亲自挂帅、调兵遣将，进行紧急部署。中共河北省委在5日召开电话会议，省委常委、副省长胡开明指出了这次突击运输的重要意义，要求各级党委至少有一名党委的常委领导这一工作，目前这个省的各专区、县都建立了突击运输的领导机构。江苏省省长惠浴宇在6日召开的全省广播大会上提出把12月作为全民运输突击月，要求作到“运量翻一番，日运三十三（万吨）”。中共湖南省委决定这一时期抽调全省汽车运输力的半数投入商品运输，这个省的省委财贸部长和商业厅的三位正副厅长已亲自率领干部四百多人，分路出发检查和协助各地组织物资调运工作。
    在各地党委和运输指挥部的组织领导下，这几天各地通往铁路沿线的公路和河道上，满载物资的车辆、船只络绎不绝，短途运输出现了空前未有的繁忙景象。湖南省参加短途运输的已有三百多万人，这个省的商业部门和运输部门密切协作，充分利用回运空车、空船，并发动群众赶运大批物资，几天之内集中到第一线（主要的码头、车站）的各种生活和生产资料达十三、四万吨，运到第二线（农村集中点）的物资也在九万吨以上。山东省各级党委和运输指挥部调动了大批汽车、木帆船、牛、马车投入了战斗；青岛市的一支突击运输队（包括一千一百零四人，三百三十六辆木排车、四十七辆汽车）在完成了1日至3日的突击运输任务，稍事休息后又投入了这一次的突击运输。目前山东全省已集中到铁路沿线的棉、烟、猪和副食品五万多吨。四川省已赶运到车站和港口待运的生猪达二十万头左右，这个省还加工了两万多吨咸腊肉，准备运到上海、北京、广东等地。（附图片）
