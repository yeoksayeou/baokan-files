    Taking the Road of Communal Industrialization
    The Communist Party of China, You County Jiubujiang People's Commune Committee
    In this year's nationwide campaign to develop the iron and steel industry, the Jiubujiang Commune in You County, Hunan Province, mastered the techniques of indigenous iron smelting and steelmaking. By November, the commune had produced 2,800 tons of indigenous iron and 125 tons of indigenous steel. However, how to further develop steel production in the future, and how to use the existing steel to arm ourselves, has become a pressing issue that needs to be resolved.
    With the development of the situation, preliminary calculations show that our commune will need at least 2,000 tons of steel in 1959. If we fail to meet this requirement, many construction plans will fall through. Where will these steels come from? Asking for help from above is not feasible. This year, we built 108 new indigenous iron smelting furnaces and two telephone lines, which required only fifteen tons of steel, but we sent several people out to find it without success, and the purchased telephones had to be left unused. Therefore, cadres and the masses urgently demand that the commune be able to roll its own steel. The stirring rods used by furnace workers become too short and there are no new replacements, and they cannot bear the heat from the fire during operation. They say, "We smelt iron every day, but we don't enjoy the benefits of iron." Some commune members reflect, "Iron cannot be eaten, so it is not as cost-effective as engaging in agriculture." Cadres and the masses are increasingly feeling the pain of not having steel. Sixty-two-year-old commune member Tan Qiusheng said to the cadres: "The commune lacks steel for construction. It would be good if the government could help the commune build a steel rolling mill!" The commune Party committee also wanted to take measures to enable itself to produce iron, steel, and steel products, so that iron and steel production could be more closely integrated with agricultural production, but they could not come up with specific solutions.
    Just when we were at a loss, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Provincial Bureau of Metallurgy instructed us to vigorously develop "small-scale integrated indigenous production." This instruction greatly inspired us and boosted our confidence in achieving the above goals.
    We considered: Jiubujiang is located by mountains and water, and transportation is also very convenient. It is only four kilometers away from the Dongtang Coal Mine, and the anthracite coal from this mine can meet the needs of iron smelting. It is also only eight kilometers away from the Gaolou and Caotian iron mines, both of which are rich mines with an iron content of over 50%, with an estimated reserve of over 50 million tons. Currently, Jiubujiang is also building a small power station, which will be able to supply electricity in the second quarter of next year. In short, Jiubujiang can build an iron and steel base with development prospects, regardless of transportation or resource conditions. In this way, we will build a commune industrial base of "small-scale integrated indigenous production" based on the original indigenous blast furnaces, small blast furnaces, and low-temperature steelmaking furnaces, and add small steel rolling equipment, mechanical processing equipment, and corresponding power equipment. According to our plan, the investment in new equipment for this base will not exceed 20,000 yuan. After completion, it can produce 12,000 tons of iron, 64,000 tons of steel, and 5,000 tons of steel products (including square steel, flat steel, steel bars, steel reinforcement, electric wires, steel wire, wire nails, etc.) annually, and can also produce 20,000 tons of coke, 15,000 tons of cement, 200 tons of mechanical processing and casting, and 500 cubic meters of wood processing. In this way, each person in the commune can receive 170 kilograms of steel per year.
    At the beginning of establishing this enterprise, most of the masses actively supported it. For example, Comrade Bin Donglian, the secretary of the branch of the handicraft industry joint enterprise, heard that the commune was going to establish an iron and steel joint enterprise, and led more than seventy carpenters and masons to Jiubujiang overnight, put down their tools and started working. More than 400 commune members of the Puan Brigade transported 8,000 refractory bricks in one night. However, a few cadres and the masses had ideological concerns. They said, "To engage in infrastructure construction, we have neither bricks and tiles nor wood. To put it into production in a short period of time, unless Lu Ban, the immortal master, comes down to earth." Some people also said, "To roll steel into steel products, unless the higher authorities send down a large number of technicians, it is impossible." There are also some people who, regardless of the actual conditions, demand to build a large-scale steel rolling mill. They said, "If we want to build it, we should build a large-scale steel rolling mill. A small-scale one will not adapt to the situation in a year." In response to the above ideological situation, the commune Party committee immediately formed a propaganda team of more than 2,000 people and launched a vigorous propaganda campaign, while organizing the masses to conduct debates. Through propaganda and debate, cadres and the masses clearly understood the significance and benefits of building an iron and steel joint enterprise, and the vast number of commune members were energetic and enthusiastic. Commune member Lin Qiusheng said:
  "We have been working hard to smelt iron and steel every day, and now we are going to enjoy the benefits of iron and steel!" Chen Chunsi, a sixty-eight-year-old commune member, said: "The Communist Party is so wise, farsighted, and does the right thing. Now our rural people can see steel rolling with our own eyes." Because we relied on the masses, the 60 cubic meters of wood and 50,000 refractory bricks needed for the construction of the factory were prepared in just three days.
    During this period, there were many vivid stories of the masses contributing materials. Commune members Deng Wugang and thirteen other households donated fifteen cubic meters of wood that they had preserved at home for several years to the enterprise. During the official start of construction, the workers, in order to build their factory as soon as possible, showed great enthusiasm and worked hard. The carpenters put forward the slogan of "fast work and skillful work," increasing the average work efficiency from processing fifteen beams and columns per day to eighty-four. The masons built one "zhang" (approximately 3.3 meters) of wall per person per day, and twenty-four people built the steel rolling workshop in one day.
    Our commune's iron and steel joint enterprise is now in production. According to our experience, establishing such an enterprise has the following six major benefits: First, continuous production from mining, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling facilitates leadership and management, and can quickly improve various technical and economic indicators, and increase output and quality. In the past, nine Party committees and fifty-seven full-time cadres in the commune were all engaged in iron and steel, but now there are only three Party committees and fifteen full-time cadres, and iron and steel production has increased by 13%. Second, it can produce a large number of steel products, which can arm ourselves, accelerate the development of commune industry, and thus promote the early realization of commune industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification. Third, it promotes the technical revolution, creates conditions for saving a large amount of labor, reducing heavy physical labor, and greatly improving labor productivity in the commune. According to the preliminary plan for 1959, a total of 6.3 million labor days are needed for industry, agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, etc., while the commune only has 14,000 laborers, with an actual shortage of 190,000 labor days. With steel products, the commune can equip itself with light railways, mine cars, two-wheeled handcarts, cableways, vehicle-mounted and rope-drawn deep plows, combine harvesters, seeders, rice mills, and silk-cutting machines next year, which is estimated to save 6,000 laborers, accounting for more than 40% of the commune's total labor force, and the labor shortage can be basically solved. This provides a reliable guarantee for the realization of our commune's 1959 production plan. Fourth, it can increase the commune's economic income. The annual profit of the joint enterprise is 2.56 million yuan, which is equivalent to the total agricultural income of our commune in 1958. Fifth, it facilitates the organization of continuous production. From the time the ore enters the factory until the steel products are produced, there is no need for long-distance transportation, which saves a large amount of labor and transportation costs. Sixth, it can gradually eliminate the gap between urban and rural areas, realize the close integration of industry and agriculture, and make laborers become versatile. Now the masses sing the praises of the benefits of the joint enterprise:
    Factories and mines are everywhere, high-rise buildings are concentrated, machines are used for production in the fields, and vehicles are used for transportation on land. River water rolls to the top of high mountains, irrigating everything by gravity, boats sail and fish in the air, and roads are accessible in all directions. Electric wires are like spider webs, broadcasts are like trumpet flowers, electric lights are used for lighting at night, and telephones are used for communication at ordinary times. Industry and agriculture are leaping forward together, and the small-scale integrated indigenous production has great magical powers. (Attached picture)

    走向公社工业化的道路
    中共攸县酒埠江人民公社委员会
    在今年全党全民大办钢铁工业中，湖南攸县酒埠江公社掌握了土法炼铁、土法炼钢的技术，到11月止，全社已炼出了土铁二千八百吨，土钢一百二十五吨。但是在今后如何进一步发展钢铁生产，并利用已有的钢铁来武装自己，就成了一个迫切需要解决的问题。
    随着形势的发展，初步计算，我们公社1959年之内，最少要用钢材二千吨。达不到这一要求，许多建设计划就会落空，这些钢材从哪儿来呢？伸手向上要是行不通的。今年我们新建一百零八座土炼铁炉和两条电话线路，只需要十五吨钢材，派了几个人到外面去找都没有解决，买来的电话机也只好搁着不用。因此，干部和群众迫切要求公社能自己轧制钢材。炉前工用的搅棍用短了没有新的替换，操作时被火烤得受不了，他们说：“天天炼铁，就是享不着铁的福。”有的社员反映：“铁又吃不得，还不如搞农业合算。”干部、群众都越来越感到没有钢材的苦处。六十二岁的社员谭秋生对干部说：“社里建设缺钢材，要求政府帮社里建个轧钢厂就好啦！”社党委也想采取措施，使自己既能生产铁，也能生产钢与钢材，使钢铁生产与农业生产更加紧密结合，可就是拿不出具体办法来。
    正当我们无计可施的时候，冶金工业部、省冶金局指示我们大搞“小土联”，这个指示大大启发了我们，鼓舞了我们实现上述目的的信心。
    我们考虑：酒埠江靠山面水，交通也很便利，距东塘煤矿只有四公里，这个煤矿的无烟煤可以满足炼铁的需要。距高楼、草田铁矿也只八公里，这两个铁矿都是含铁50％以上的富矿，估计藏量有五千多万吨。目前酒埠江还在建设小电站，明年第二季度即可送电。总之，酒埠江无论从交通条件、资源条件来说，都可以建设一个具有发展前途的钢铁基地。这样，我们就以原有土高炉、矮高炉、低温炼钢炉为基础，增设小型轧钢设备、机械加工设备和相应的动力设备等，建成了一个“小土联”的公社工业基地。按照我们的规划，这个基地新增设备所用的投资没有超过二万元，建成以后，每年可产生铁一万二千吨，钢六万四千吨，钢材（包括方钢、扁钢、钢条、钢筋、电线、钢丝、洋钉等）五千吨，并可生产焦炭二万吨，水泥一万五千吨，机械加工铸造二百吨，木材加工五百立方公尺。这样，全社每人每年可分到一百七十公斤钢。
    我们在建立这个企业的开始，大部分群众积极拥护。如手工业联合企业支部书记宾冬莲同志，听说公社要建立钢铁联合企业，就带领七十多个木瓦工连夜赶到酒埠江，放下工具就开始工作。普安大队四百多个社员 ，一天晚上运来了八千块耐火砖。也有少数干部和群众思想有顾虑，他们说：“搞基建，一没砖瓦，二没木材，要短期投入生产，除非有鲁班仙师下凡。”也有人说：“要把钢轧成材，除非上级有大批技术人员下来，否则是不行的。”也还有些人不顾实际条件，要求搞大型的轧钢厂，他们说：“要搞就搞大型轧钢厂，小型的过一年又不适应形势了。”针对上述思想情况，社党委立即组成了一支二千多人的宣传队伍，大张旗鼓地开展宣传活动，同时组织群众进行辩论。通过宣传辩论，干部和群众都明确认识了建设钢铁联合企业的意义和好处，广大社员个个精神奋发，干劲冲天。社员林秋生说：
  “天天吃苦炼钢铁，这下要享钢铁福了！”六十八岁的老社员陈春四说：“共产党真英明，看得远，做得对，这下我们乡下人也亲眼看到轧钢了。”由于依靠了群众，建厂需要的六十立方公尺的木材、五万块耐火砖，只三天时间就备齐了。
    这中间出现了不少群众献料献材的生动故事。社员邓吾刚等十三户，将家里保存了几年的十五立方公尺木材献给了企业。在正式动工兴建的时候，工人们为了使自己的工厂早日建成，拿出了冲天的干劲，进行紧张的劳动。木工们提出了快干巧干的口号，每天由加工十五根梁柱的普通工效，提高到八十四根；泥工一天一人砌一方丈墙，二十四人一天就砌好了轧钢车间。
    我们公社的钢铁联合企业现在已经投入生产了。根据我们的体会，建立这样的企业，有如下的六大好处：一、采矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢连续生产，便于领导和管理，能够较快地提高各种技术经济指标，提高产量和质量。过去公社九个党委、五十七个脱产干部全抓钢铁，如今只三个党委、十五个脱产干部，钢铁产量反而增长13％。二、可以生产大批钢材，这样就可以武装自己，加速发展公社工业，从而促使公社工业化和农业机械化、电气化早日实现。三、促进了技术革命，为社里节省大批劳力、减轻笨重体力劳动、大大提高劳动生产率创造了条件。1959年初步规划，工、农、林、渔、牧、副业等，共计需要六百三十万个劳动日，而全社劳动力只有一万四千人，实际缺少劳动力十九万个。社里有了钢材，明年就可以装备起轻便铁路、矿车、双轮手推车，搞索道化、车子化、绳索牵引深耕犁、联合收割机、播种机、碾米机、切丝机等，估计可以节省劳力六千人，占全社总劳力的40％以上，劳力紧张现象基本上可以解决。这对实现我社1959年的生产规划，就有了可靠的保证。四、可以增加公社的经济收入。联合企业一年的利润就有二百五十六万元，相当于我社1958年农业的总收入。五、便于组织连续生产。从矿砂进厂一直到钢材生产出来，无需长距离的运输，这样就节省了大批的劳力和运输费用。六、可以逐步消除城乡差别，实现工农业的密切结合，使劳动者成为多面手，现在群众歌颂联合企业的好处说：
    到处有工厂矿山，集中建高楼大厦，田里生产用机器，陆地运输车子拉。河水滚上高山顶，灌溉全部自流化，半空中行船捕鱼，汽车路四通八达。电线好似蜘蛛网，广播犹如喇叭花，黑夜照明是电灯，平时通讯用电话，工业农业齐跃进，小土联群神通大。（附图片）
