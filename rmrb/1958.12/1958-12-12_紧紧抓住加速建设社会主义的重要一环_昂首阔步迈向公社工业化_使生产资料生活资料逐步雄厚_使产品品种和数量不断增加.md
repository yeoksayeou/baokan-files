Hunan: Global One Commune simultaneously promotes both Industry and Agriculture with cooperation
Jiangsu: Ancient City Commune uses local materials to engage in comprehensive utilization on a large scale
Shanxi: Red Flag Commune develops and improves industry at the same time

    According to the New Hunan Daily, since its establishment in late September, the Global One People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, has consistently adhered to the principle of promoting both industry and agriculture, advancing rapidly towards the industrialization of the commune. To date, the commune has established 1,146 light and heavy industrial factories, producing a large number of means of production and means of livelihood.

    Before the establishment of the Global One People's Commune, the agricultural production cooperatives in various townships had some industries, but they were very scattered, with weak strength, and funds, resources, and labor could not be utilized rationally and effectively. After the establishment of the commune, it immediately adopted the method of merging small factories into large factories and merging scattered households into factories, appropriately concentrating industrial production, establishing factories according to the distribution of regional resources, and fixing the labor force invested in industrial production, so that the commune's industry developed rapidly. In less than three months since its establishment, it has built a Daling Iron Plant with a daily output of four to five tons of pig iron, nine cement plants, and so on. Each brigade has sewing factories, farm tool factories, oil pressing factories, rice mills, and fertilizer plants. In addition, there are rayon factories, cultural paper factories, starch factories, weaving factories, brick and tile factories, porcelain factories, soda ash factories, saltpeter factories, alcohol factories, lime factories, pesticide factories, rain gear factories, and firecracker factories.

    Among these factories, the farm tool factory directly under the commune alone produced 12 machine tools this year, and the whole commune produced a total of 24 machine tools; the woodworking workshop rushed to produce more than 100 rice harvesters and a faucet-type sweet potato shredder that can shred 3,000 kilograms of sweet potatoes per hour during the harvest season. During the rush to plant rapeseed, more than 500 deep plows were rushed to be made in more than ten days. According to the latest two-month statistics, the commune's fertilizer plant has an average daily output of 37 tons of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (excluding potassium calcium mixed fertilizer), and the highest daily output is more than 100 tons. The commune's industry has already played a huge supporting role in agricultural production.

    The basic experience of this commune in running industries is: putting politics in command and ideology first. Through publicity and education, and free airing of views and debates, they overcame the incorrect ideas of some people who believed that the commune was engaged in agricultural production, so why bother running industries; the agricultural tasks are heavy, and running industries would be overwhelming, and one could only focus on one thing. At the same time, the Party committee made new arrangements in work and manpower, dividing industry and agriculture into two fronts for leadership, with fixed personnel, to ensure that the work was not chaotic. On the other hand, there was also flexible coordination, organizing appropriate manpower to participate in shock work when agricultural labor was tight; and organizing agricultural labor to support when industry was tight. This ensured that production was not affected and also ensured mutual cooperation to overcome difficulties.

    The practice of this commune in running industries is: first, to establish the guiding ideology of serving agricultural production. In this way, agricultural production can be supported by industry, and both can leap forward; and those engaged in agriculture are interested in running industries, and those engaged in industry are equally at ease. Second, is to do whatever is available according to local characteristics, starting from the specific conditions in the countryside, to run industries with less money or even without money. For example, in order to run a fertilizer factory, the commune formed a prospecting team and looked for minerals everywhere. As a result, it found substitutes for phosphate rock, potassium feldspar, limestone, quartz, and dolomite needed to produce phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. The commune only needs to spend some labor to get a large amount of quick-acting fertilizer. The third is to pay attention to cultivating talents to prepare for the expansion of industry. The commune organizes young people to learn technology from older people with technology to ensure that technical talents can truly lay a good foundation in the cultivation process. The fourth is to first manufacture machine tools and other working mother machines to break through the difficulties in machine manufacturing and change the state of manual production, and arm themselves with their own strength.

    Nanjing, 11th of this newspaper. The Ancient City People's Commune in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, according to the principle of local raw materials, local needs, and local forces, runs industries on a large scale and engages in comprehensive utilization on a large scale. The variety of industrial products has increased from 30 to 224; the industrial output value has increased sharply from the original 126,000 yuan to 460,000 yuan. This has played a very important role in increasing commune accumulation, improving people's lives, and promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    The Ancient City People's Commune is a cotton, grain, and miscellaneous grain area. This year's bumper harvest in agriculture provides sufficient raw materials for running industries. Many agricultural and sideline products, such as sugar beets, cotton, and soybeans, urgently need to be processed locally. Many daily necessities and non-staple foods needed by the people are also urgently required to be supplied locally. The natural resources near the commune are also quite rich, with a large amount of quartz silicon, clay, and limestone, which can develop industries such as glass, lime, cement, and bricks and tiles. According to objective needs and possibilities, the Ancient City People's Commune is determined to implement the "three local" principles, that is, local commune resources; local production and living needs; local manpower, material resources, and financial resources, to run factories on a large scale. In just twenty-five days, forty new factories were built. The vast majority of them are light industrial factories, including papermaking, glass, winemaking, sugar making, starch, leached oil, flour products, soy products, cured meats, soap, egg product processing, textiles, knitting, printing and dyeing, flour, dairy products, etc. Another part is established around the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the liberation of labor, such as wind and thermal power plants, cement, lime, bricks and tiles, and pesticide factories.

    The total investment in the new factories is only 12,000 yuan, truly achieving less spending and more work. Now each factory has a full-time cadre in charge, and five soldiers and eight artisans have been found from major brigades.

    The newly built factories make full use of resources and engage in comprehensive utilization. The products of this factory are often the raw materials of another factory, linked one after another, utilizing and cooperating with each other, basically achieving self-sufficiency in various raw materials. For example, this commune has set up many factories around the comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes. The starch made from sweet potatoes by the starch factory is supplied to the factories making maltose and glucose, and some are supplied to the flour product factory to make vermicelli and bean curd sheets. The sweet potatoes processed into sweet potato flour in the pastry factory are used to make more than 100 kinds of pastries. The sweet potato residue left over from starch making and the sugar beet residue left over from sugar making, as well as inedible sweet potato vines, become the raw materials for winemaking in the winery. The sweet potato residue left over from winemaking is the raw material for vinegar making.

    According to Shanxi Daily, the Hongqi People's Commune in Bagong, Jincheng, Shanxi Province, conscientiously implements the policy of promoting both industry and agriculture, strives to realize the industrialization of the commune, mobilizes farmers to run industries on a large scale, so that both industry and agriculture leap forward.

    In the first half of this year, agricultural production took the lead and leapt forward rapidly, and there was a great need for things, such as fertilizers, water lifting machinery, deep plowing tools, and so on. However, neither local industry nor handicrafts could meet such a huge need.

    The commune party committee analyzed this situation, boldly led the peasant masses, and used the method of "large-scale movement, small-scale shock" to run industries on a large scale to meet the needs of agricultural production. In the movement of "everyone becomes a craftsman, and everyone makes carts," on the one hand, the masses were mobilized to manufacture and repair 9,000 large and small carts, ensuring the timely completion of the manure delivery task; at the same time, two machinery manufacturing and repair factories were developed and established, producing 4,157 machines and tools throughout the year. In the movement of brigades running factories and households making fertilizers, eight kinds of quick-acting fertilizers were made, a total of more than 1,900 dan. In addition, 40 long-term soil fertilizer factories were set up. In the movement of the whole party and the whole people smelting steel, 39,000 tons of pig iron were smelted. In addition to supporting national construction, 8 li of earthen railways were built with earthen iron to deliver manure, pull coal, and transport ore.

    This year, the total number of formal factories in the commune has increased from 21 last year to 209, and the total value of industrial production has accounted for 55% of the total value of agricultural output. Now the commune's industry is improving and developing. The earthen furnaces in the iron factory have become earthen blast furnaces, and there are also two small foreign blast furnaces. In addition, a variety of economies have also developed rapidly. This year, mountain goods and fruit processing factories, fiber manufacturing factories, and gunpowder factories have been set up.

    紧紧抓住加速建设社会主义的重要一环
    昂首阔步迈向公社工业化
    使生产资料生活资料逐步雄厚  使产品品种和数量不断增加
    湖南  全球一公社工农业既并举又协作
    江苏  古城公社就地取材大搞综合利用
    山西  红旗公社工业一面发展一面提高
    据新湖南报消息  湖南省浏阳县全球一人民公社从9月下旬建社以来，一直坚持工农业并举的方针，向公社工业化的道路猛进。到目前为止，全社已经办起一千一百四十六个轻重工业工厂，生产了大批的生产资料和生活资料。
    全球一人民公社建立以前，各乡农业生产合作社都有一些工业，但是十分分散，力量单薄，资金、资源和劳力不能得到合理、有效的利用。公社建立后，立即采取小厂并大厂和分散户并工厂的办法，把工业生产适当地集中起来，根据地区资源的分布情况，建立工厂，并固定投入工业生产的劳动力，使公社工业发展迅猛异常。建社不到三个月，就建立起一座日产生铁四到五吨的大岭铁厂、九座水泥厂等。各个大队都有缝纫厂、农具厂、榨油厂和碾米厂、化肥厂。此外，还有人造棉厂、文化纸厂、淀粉厂、织布厂、砖瓦厂、瓷厂、纯碱厂、硝厂、酒精厂、石灰厂、农药厂、雨具厂、编爆厂等。
    这些工厂中，仅公社直属农具厂今年就制出了十二台机床，全社共产二十四部机床；木工车间在收割时赶制了一百多部割禾机和一台每小时刨红薯三千斤的龙头式刨丝机。在抢种油菜时，十多天中赶工制出了五百多部深耕犁。据最近两月统计，全社化肥厂平均日产磷、钾肥（钾钙混合肥除外）达三十七吨，最高日产量达一百吨以上。公社的工业对农业生产已经起到了巨大的支持作用。
    这个公社办工业的基本经验是：政治挂帅，思想先行。经过宣传教育、鸣放辩论，克服了有些人认为公社是搞农业生产，何必办工业；农业任务重，再办工业就吃不消，只能抓一头等不正确的思想。同时，党委会又在工作和人力上作了新的安排，把工农业分为两条战线进行领导，人马固定，保证了工作不混乱。另一方面，又有灵活的机动配合，农业劳力紧张时，组织适当的人力参加突击；工业紧张时又组织农业劳动力支援。这样保证了生产互不受影响，也保证互相协作，突破难关。
    这个公社办工业的做法是：首先树立为农业生产服务的指导思想。这样，既使农业生产得到工业支援，双双跃进；也使从事农业的人对办工业感兴趣，搞工业的人同样安心。其次，是根据本地特点，有什么办什么，从农村具体条件出发，做到少花钱甚至不花钱办工业。例如，为了办化肥厂，公社组成了探矿队，四处找矿，结果把生产磷、钾肥需要的磷矿石、钾长石、石灰石、石英石和白云石的代用品都找出来了，公社只需花些劳力，就得到大量的快速化肥。第三是注意培养人材，为扩大工业作好准备。公社组织青年向有技术的老年人学技术，保证技术人材在培养过程中能够真正打好基础。第四是首先制造机床等工作母机，以突破机器制造的难关，改变手工生产的状况，用自己力量武装自己。
    本报南京11日电  江苏省宿迁县古城人民公社根据就原料、就需要和就力量的原则，大办工业，大搞综合利用。工业产品品种由三十种增加到二百二十四种；工业产值由原来的十二万六千元猛增到四十六万元。这对增加公社积累、改善人民生活、促进工农业生产大跃进，起了很重要的作用。
    古城人民公社是一个棉粮杂谷地区。今年农业大丰收，为办工业提供了充足的原料。许多农副产品如甜菜、棉花、大豆等，急需就地加工。人民所需要的许多生活用品和副食品也迫切要求就地供应。公社附近的天然资源也相当丰富，有大量的石英矽、粘土和石灰石，可以发展玻璃、石灰、水泥、砖瓦等工业。根据客观的需要和可能，古城人民公社决心贯彻“三就”的原则，即就公社资源；就生产、生活的需要；就人力、物力、财力的可能，大办工厂。短短二十五天内，就新建了四十个工厂。其中绝大部分是轻工业工厂，有造纸、玻璃、制酒、制糖、淀粉、浸出油、粉制品、豆制品、腌腊、肥皂、蛋品加工、纺织、针织、印染、面粉、乳制品等。另一部分是围绕工农业生产需要和解放劳动力建立的，如风力、火力电厂、水泥、石灰、砖瓦、农药等工厂。
    新建工厂全部投资仅一万二千元，真正做到花钱少，办事多。现在每个工厂都有专职干部挂帅，并从各大队找来了五兵八匠。
    新建工厂就资源条件，大搞综合利用。这个厂的产品往往又是另一工厂的原料，一环扣一环，互相利用，互相协作，基本做到各种原料自给自足。例如这个公社围绕综合利用山芋就办起了许多工厂。淀粉厂利用山芋制成的淀粉，有的供给制饴糖、葡萄糖，有的供应粉制品厂制成粉丝、粉皮。山芋在糕点厂经过加工制成山芋粉，又利用山芋粉制成各种糕点一百多种。制淀粉剩下的山芋渣和制糖剩下的甜菜渣以及不能食用的山芋茆成为酒厂的酿酒原料。酿酒留下的山芋渣是制醋的原料。
    据山西日报消息  山西省晋城巴公红旗人民公社，认真贯彻执行工农业并举方针，争取实现公社工业化，发动农民大办工业，使工农业双双跃进。
    今年前半年，农业生产一马当先，跃进很快，需要的东西很多，如肥料、提水机械、深翻工具等等。但是，不论地方工业也好，手工业也好，都不能满足这样庞大的需要。
    公社党委分析了这种情况，大胆领导农民群众，用“大运动，小突击”的方法大办工业，来满足农业生产的需要。在“人人当工匠，大闹车子化”运动中，一方面发动群众制造和修理了九千辆大车和小车，保证了送粪任务的按时完成；同时，发展和建立起了两个机械制造修配厂，全年生产了四千一百五十七件机器和工具。在队队办工厂和户户造肥料运动中，造出了八种速效肥料，共一千九百多担。此外，还办起四十个长年生产的土化肥工厂。在全党全民大炼钢铁运动中，炼出了生铁三万九千吨，除了支援国家建设外，用土铁兴修了土铁路八华里，送粪、拉煤、运矿石。
    今年，全公社的正式工厂由去年的二十一个增加到了二百另九个，工业生产总值已经占到农业总产值的55％。现在公社的工业正在提高和发展。铁厂中的土方炉变成了土高炉，还有了两个小洋高炉。另外，多种经济也迅速地发展起来了，今年办了山货水果加工厂、纤维制造厂、火药厂等。（附图片）
