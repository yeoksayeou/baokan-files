	How Did Granite Get Above Ground?
	Shigong

	Granite forms deep underground, but we see granite on the surface today. How did granite get above ground to show its face? You might think that the rocks covering the granite were weathered and then carried away by running water, wind, etc., like open-pit mining. The upper rock layers were removed, and the granite underneath was naturally exposed.

	However, the carrying capacity of wind and water is limited. In deeper underground areas, it's difficult for wind to blow away anything, and rivers can only erode land higher than sea level. Also, if it were solely due to surface erosion, then granite outcrops would definitely be in low-lying areas. However, granite often appears in mountains, and some even form very high peaks. This is due to the uplift of the Earth's crust.

	How does the Earth's crust uplift? If you push a tablecloth, wrinkles will appear on it. When the Earth's crust is subjected to strong pressure from both sides, it will also fold like a tablecloth. Due to this movement, rocks one or two kilometers underground can be lifted to the surface. Most of the world's mountains are formed by this movement, so it is called orogenic movement.

	The pressure underground is very high, and the temperature is also very high. Rocks underground can become like rosin, slowly changing shape without breaking. However, there are also times when fractures occur. In the field, it is common to see originally connected rock layers being faulted and moved from their original positions, which we call faults. Some valleys are located where faults are.

	When a fracture occurs somewhere in the Earth's crust, the pressure underground is reduced, and magma becomes active there, rising to the surface, trying to rush out. Some become volcanoes, while others drill into the crust that has risen due to folding and solidify. This raised portion is the high mountain we see today.

	Orogenic movement is the result of the development of internal contradictions within the Earth. Interestingly, today's high mountains such as the Himalayas, Qinling Mountains, Qilian Mountains, Tianshan Mountains... were all seas in the past. These seas mostly formed narrow, elongated troughs, which we call geosynclines. The bottom of the geosyncline continuously sinks, so it can accommodate a large amount of sediment, creating very thick sedimentary rocks. However, eventually the forces change, and the seabed not only stops sinking but instead rises upward. The rock layers above are crumpled together, and magma also intrudes, resulting in the mountains we see today. This type of area is called a geosynclinal region and is an unstable part of the Earth's crust.

	Because there is more magmatic activity in geosynclinal regions, related metal mines and other mineral resources are very abundant. The Qilian Mountains are such a treasure trove. It can be expected that many treasures will also be discovered in the Qinling Mountains and Tianshan Mountains.

    花岗岩怎样跑到地上来的？ 
    石工
    花岗岩形成的时候是在深深的地下，可是如今我们在地面也看见了花岗岩，花岗岩是怎样跑到地上来露脸的呢？你会想到，一定是掩盖在花岗岩上的岩石经过风化再被流水、风等搬走了，好像开采露天矿一样，上面的岩层被揭掉，下面的花岗岩自然露出来了。
    可是风水的搬运作用是有一定限度的，在地下较深的地方，风是很难再吹走什么东西，而河流也只能侵蚀陆地上比海平面高的部分；同时，如果仅仅由于地表剥蚀的作用，那末花岗岩出露的地方一定都很低洼，可是事实上花岗岩多在山里出现，有的还形成很高的山峰。这是由于地壳上升隆起的缘故。
    地壳是怎样隆起的呢？你用手去推桌布，桌布上就会出现凹凸不平的皱纹。当地壳受到从两侧来的强大压力时，也会像桌布一样折曲起来。由于这种运动，地下一、二十公里处的岩石也能被掀到地面来，世界上大部分的山都是由于这种运动造成的，因此人们叫它做造山运动。
    地下的压力很大，温度也很高，岩石在地下可以变得像松香一样，缓慢地改变形状而不致破裂。但是也有发生破裂的时候，在野外常可见到本来相连的岩层发生错断，移动了原来的位置，我们叫它做断层。有些沟谷正是断层所在的地方。
    当地壳某处发生断裂的时候，地下所受的压力就减轻了，因而岩浆就在那里活跃起来，向地面上升，企图冲出去，有的成为火山，有的则钻到因折皱而隆起的地壳中凝结起来。这隆起的部分就是今天的高山。
    造山运动是地球内部矛盾发展的结果。说来也有趣，今天的高山如喜马拉雅山、秦岭、祁连山、天山……都是过去的海。这些海多成狭长的槽形，我们叫它做地槽。地槽的底不断向下陷，因此能容纳大量的沉积物，造成了很厚的沉积岩。但是，终于力量发生了变化，海底不仅不再沉降，反而向上隆起，上面的岩层皱在一起，岩浆也侵入了，结果变成了今天我们看见的山，这种地带我们叫它做地槽区，是地壳上不稳定的部分。
    由于地槽区里的岩浆活动较多，所以有关的金属矿和其他矿产就很丰富，祁连山就是这样一个宝库，可以预期，秦岭、天山这些地方也将会发现很多宝藏。
