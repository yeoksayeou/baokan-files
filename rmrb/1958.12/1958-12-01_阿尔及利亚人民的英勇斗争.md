The bugle of dawn

The Algerian people’s more than four years of anti-colonialist national liberation war has achieved brilliant results. The national liberation movement is like a prairie fire, burning across the entire Algerian territory. The desperate struggle of the French colonialists cannot stop the heroic Algerian people from achieving final victory.

The Algerian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Turkish invasion in the 16th century and the Spanish invasion in the 18th century did not conquer this country. The attack by French colonialists in 1830 was met with resolute resistance, and the war lasted for eighteen years. Since France occupied Algeria, the enslaved Algerian people have launched more than fifty heroic uprisings one after another.

On November 1, 1954, armed struggles against French colonialists broke out in the Aurès Mountains and Kabylie Mountains, which had repeatedly become bases for national revolution. This was the bugle of dawn, and it immediately awakened all the Algerian people to join the battle. French imperialism has continuously sent reinforcements from the mainland, increasing the colonial army from 50,000 in 1954 to about 600,000 mechanized troops and paratroopers this year, as well as about 200,000 various security forces, spending as much as 600 to 1,000 billion francs each year. However, in the past four years, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from 3,000 armed guerrillas to a modernly equipped force of more than 130,000 people. They seized modern equipment and weapons from the enemy, conducted large-scale mobile warfare, and could often concentrate forces of more than 5,000 people to attack French military positions. Their armed struggle area has expanded to three-quarters of the country's territory, causing heavy casualties to the French colonial army.

The Algerian National Liberation Army has received strong support from the broad masses of the people. People's own political and military grass-roots organizations were quickly established in all liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas. A reporter from the Italian "Avanti!" wrote: "In various regions, especially in the countryside, between the two forces, the friendly area and the enemy area, there is no longer a dividing line, but a country. The French army cannot gain a foothold and cannot penetrate," while the Algerian National Liberation Army "is like a fish in water" among the residents. An American "Saturday Evening Post" reporter also wrote: "We advanced smoothly along the northern basin leading to the Mediterranean, passing through village after village... As long as the French move, the nationalists know immediately." Another American reporter witnessed an old man whose fingers were chopped off by French search troops, but he did not reveal the whereabouts of the guerrillas hiding nearby.

Entered a new stage

The Algerian people's blood has not been shed in vain. The independent Algerian Republic, which they had dreamed of, was officially proclaimed on September 19 this year. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic marks a new stage in the Algerian national liberation struggle.

The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic came at a time when the French monopoly capital group and fascist soldiers put de Gaulle on stage in an attempt to save their dying fate in Algeria. De Gaulle promulgated a dictatorial "constitution" in an attempt to annex Algeria, and dispatched a large number of military police, forcing the Algerian people to conduct a "referendum" on the "constitution" with bayonets. However, De Gaulle's vicious colonial policy was resolutely resisted by millions of Algerian patriots.

The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has further united the people of the whole country to fight the French colonialists to the end. On September 19, the news of the establishment of the provisional government was warmly welcomed throughout the country. The people actively implemented all orders and instructions of the provisional government's local governments. From that day on, the National Liberation Army launched widespread attacks throughout the country according to the government's orders, giving the French colonial army doubly heavy blows.

The Algerian national liberation struggle has greatly encouraged the national liberation movements of the people of Arab countries and the entire African people. The establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government was regarded as their own victory by the people of Arab and African countries. The King of Mauritania stated after congratulating the establishment of the Algerian Provisional Government that if France does not recognize Mauritania's right to independence, then the Mauritanian people will also take up arms to fight for freedom. Ruben Um Nyobé, President of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, also said: "The Algerian people's struggle has helped us a lot, because this struggle has weakened French imperialism politically and militarily. Our joint efforts will finally defeat French imperialism."

The imperialists panicked and were uneasy. The French government openly announced in a threatening tone that it would sever diplomatic relations with countries that recognized the Algerian Provisional Government. The US and British governments also quickly announced that they would not recognize the Algerian Provisional Government. However, all national independence struggles never require the recognition of imperialism; they can get the just support of the people of the world. As soon as the Algerian Provisional Government was established, it immediately received recognition from representatives of fourteen Asian and African countries representing nearly 900 million people, and received congratulations from people all over the world. The Republic of Iraq, which had achieved revolutionary victory, announced that it refused to restore diplomatic relations with France due to France's war against Algeria, and confiscated French assets in Iraq. Facts have proved that the Algerian Republic will have more and more friends, while the French imperialist elements will become more and more isolated.

Moving from victory to victory

The Algerian people have achieved a series of major victories since the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic. This is particularly manifested in the progress of the military struggle and the heavy blow to De Gaulle's "election" conspiracy and the negotiation "truce" fraud.

After the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the National Liberation Army's combat was particularly active. In the past month, nearly 100 French troops have been killed or wounded and a French military aircraft has been destroyed on average almost every day. In early November, the National Liberation Army attacked seventeen French military strongholds, severely hitting the heavily touted Morris Line. The morale of the French colonial army wavered. Especially the soldiers of the Foreign Legion, which were regarded as elite French troops, surrendered to the National Liberation Army in batches with their weapons, hoping to have the Provisional Government send them back to their countries. As a result, the French military headquarters had to transfer the Foreign Legion from the most critical eastern battlefield to the Sahara Desert. Since De Gaulle came to power, he has gathered 80,000 troops from the mainland and various territories and transferred them to Algeria, but recently the French military headquarters invading Algeria has been asking the country for reinforcements again.

Crushing the "election" and "truce" conspiracies

The Algerian people's determination to unite and persist in their struggle has led to the shameful failure of the "election" conspiracy recently promoted by the French government in Algeria. In order to prove to the Algerian people that they were "equal to French citizens," De Gaulle announced that 67 members would be elected from Algeria to participate in the French National Assembly, and stipulated that two-thirds of them should be Algerians. However, what the Algerian people demanded was independence. They responded to the call of the Provisional Government and unanimously boycotted the French "election." By the deadline for the nomination of candidates—November 2—not a single person was willing to be a candidate. Despite the most barbarous terrorist actions taken by the French colonial authorities, arresting more than 40,000 Algerian residents, looting many villages, and even burning Mr. Bouhired, who refused to be a "candidate," to death with gasoline in front of his children, these brutal methods still did not achieve the desired effect. Thus, at the end of the week of extended candidate nomination deadline, the colonial authorities had to put together a list of candidates themselves, filled with national traitors who had long been despised by the Algerian people and had no representativeness at all. The French "Liberation" said: De Gaulle's entire plan has gone bankrupt.

Recently, the French government has released news that it is willing to hold so-called "truce" negotiations. However, De Gaulle's trick is very clumsy. He insisted on the reactionary policy of annexing Algeria and fundamentally denied Algeria's right to independence. Therefore, the so-called "truce" was to ask the Algerian people to give up the national liberation struggle and surrender to French colonialism. This is of course unacceptable to the Algerian people. In the policy statement after the establishment of the Provisional Government, Prime Minister Abbas solemnly pointed out: "The heroic Algerian people will never lay down their arms until their independent rights and sovereignty are formally recognized." As for peacefully resolving the Algerian issue through negotiations, that has always been the consistent position of the Algerian government. The Provisional Government has stated that as long as the purpose of this negotiation is to seek a political solution and it is conducted on the basis of negotiations between the governments of two independent countries, it is ready to meet with French representatives. This solemn position shattered De Gaulle's "truce" conspiracy.

The Algerian people's struggle is arduous, and there are still many difficulties on their road to victory, especially because the United States supports France financially and with arms supplies. At the beginning of this year, when France was facing a financial collapse due to the war, it received financial "assistance" from the United States. Algerian Minister of Transportation Boussouf recently stated: "In Algeria, we almost have to fight the Americans. Almost all of France's weapons and equipment—from military uniform buttons to food supplies—come from the United States." However, the United States' support for France's colonial war has educated all the Algerian people and made them realize that the US imperialists are the most ferocious enemies of the national liberation movement.

The Algerian people are uniting around the Provisional Government, actively supporting and participating in the great national liberation war. They will be able to overcome any difficulties and create more favorable conditions on the basis of the victories they have already achieved, and achieve final victory with the support of the people of the world.

    阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争
    余立三
    黎明的号角
    阿尔及利亚人民四年多反殖民主义的民族解放战争，获得了辉煌的战果。民族解放运动势如燎原之火，燃遍了整个阿尔及利亚国土。法国殖民主义者的死命挣扎，是不能阻止英勇的阿尔及利亚人民取得最后胜利的。
    阿尔及利亚人民有着光荣的革命传统。十六世纪土耳其人的入侵，十八世纪西班牙人的入侵，都没有征服过这个国家。1830年法国殖民主义者的进攻，更遭到了坚决抵抗，战争延续了十八个年头。自从法国占领阿尔及利亚以来，受尽奴役的阿尔及利亚人民前仆后继地举行了五十余次英勇的起义。
    1954年11月1日，在曾经多次成为民族革命根据地的奥雷斯山区和卡比利山区，爆发了反抗法国殖民者的武装斗争。这是黎明的号角，它立刻唤起了全体阿尔及利亚人民投入战斗。法帝国主义不断从本土增派援兵，把殖民军队从1954年的五万人增加到今年约六十万人的机械化部队和伞兵，还有二十万人左右的各种保安部队，每年消耗的战费高达六千至一万亿法郎。但四年多以来，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已由三千名武装起来的游击队员，发展到一支十三万人以上的、有现代化装备的部队。他们从敌人手里夺来了近代的装备和武器，进行大规模的运动战，经常可以集中五千人以上的部队进攻法军阵地。他们的武装斗争地区已扩大到全国四分之三的领土上，使法国殖民军遭到很大的伤亡。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军得到了广大人民的有力支持。在所有的解放区和敌占区，很快就建立了人民自己的政治和军事基层组织。意大利“前进报”的记者写道：“在各个地区，特别是在乡间，在两个力量之间，友军区和敌军区之间，不再有分界线，而是一个国家，法国军队站不住脚，无法渗入”，而阿尔及利亚民族解放军在居民中“如鱼得水”。美国“星期六晚邮报”的记者也写道：“我们沿着通向地中海的北部盆地前进，一路顺当地经过一个村落又一个村落，……只要法国人动一动，民族主义者就立刻知道”。另一个美国记者亲眼看见了一位老人，他被法军搜索部队砍断了手指，却没有泄露藏身在咫尺的游击队员。
    跨入了新阶段
    阿尔及利亚人民的血没有白流，他们梦寐以求的、独立的阿尔及利亚共和国已在今年9月19日正式宣告诞生。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，标志着阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争跨入了新的阶段。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，是在法国垄断资本集团和法西斯军人把戴高乐捧上台，企图挽回他们在阿尔及利亚的垂死命运的时候。戴高乐颁布了妄图并吞阿尔及利亚的独裁“宪法”，并且出动了大批军警，用刺刀强迫阿尔及利亚人民就“宪法”进行“公民投票”。但戴高乐的这种凶恶的殖民主义政策，遭到了阿尔及利亚千百万爱国者的坚决反抗。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，进一步团结了全国人民，同法国殖民者斗争到底。9月19日那一天，临时政府成立的消息在全国各地受到热烈的欢迎。人民积极地执行临时政府各地方政府的一切命令和指示。从那一天起，民族解放军根据政府的命令在全国广泛出击，给了法国殖民军队加倍沉重的打击。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争大大鼓舞了阿拉伯各国人民和整个非洲人民的民族解放运动。阿尔及利亚临时政府的成立，被阿拉伯各国和非洲各国人民当作自己的胜利。毛里塔尼亚王公在祝贺阿尔及利亚临时政府成立以后声明说，如果法国不承认毛里塔尼亚独立的权利，那么毛里塔尼亚人民也将拿起武器来为自由而战。喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃也发表谈话说：“阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，给予我们很大的帮助，因为这场斗争在政治上、军事上都削弱了法国帝国主义。我们共同的努力，将最后战胜法国帝国主义。”
    帝国主义者慌做一团，惶惶不安。法国政府公然以威胁口吻，宣布要同承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的国家断绝外交关系。美英两国政府也连忙宣布不承认阿尔及利亚临时政府。但是，一切民族的独立斗争从来不要帝国主义的承认，他们可以得到全世界人民的正义支持。阿尔及利亚临时政府一成立，就立刻得到了十四个亚非国家代表近九亿人民的承认，受到世界各地人民的祝贺。取得了革命胜利的伊拉克共和国宣布，由于法国对阿尔及利亚进行战争，它拒绝同法国恢复外交关系，并且没收了法国在伊拉克的资产。事实证明，阿尔及利亚共和国将得到愈来愈多的朋友，而法国帝国主义分子却将愈来愈陷于孤立。
    从胜利走向胜利
    阿尔及利亚人民在共和国临时政府成立以后，又取得了一系列重大胜利。这特别表现在军事斗争上的进展，以及给予戴高乐的“选举”阴谋和谈判“停火”骗局的沉重打击上面。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府成立以后，民族解放军的战斗特别活跃。最近一个月来，平均每天差不多都要毙伤近百名法军，击毁一架法国军用飞机。在11月初，民族解放军进攻了十七个法军据点，沉重地打击了法国人大吹大擂的摩里斯防线。法国殖民军队军心动摇，尤其是被视为法国精锐部队的外籍军团士兵，成批地携械向民族解放军投诚，希望能让临时政府把他们遣送回国，以至法军司令部不得不把外籍军团从最吃紧的东部战场上调到撒哈拉沙漠中去。戴高乐上台以后，已经从本土和各属地凑集了八万部队调到阿尔及利亚，然而最近侵阿法军司令部又在要求国内增派援军了。
    粉碎“选举”和“停火”阴谋
    阿尔及利亚人民团结一致，坚持斗争的决心，使法国政府最近在阿尔及利亚推行的“选举”阴谋，遭到可耻的失败。戴高乐为了向阿尔及利亚人民证明他们“与法国公民平等”，宣布要从阿尔及利亚选出六十七个议员去参加法国国民议会，并且规定其中要有三分之二是阿尔及利亚人。但是阿尔及利亚人民要求的是独立，他们响应临时政府的号召，一致抵制法国的这场“选举”。到规定的候选人提名截止日期——11月2日，还没有一个人愿意充当候选人。尽管法国殖民当局采取了最野蛮的恐怖行动，逮捕了四万多阿尔及利亚居民，洗劫了不少村庄，甚至把拒绝当“候选人”的布海德先生当着他的儿女的面前用汽油烧死，然而这些残暴手段还是没有收到效果。于是，在候选人提名期限延长的一星期结束时，殖民当局不得不自己拼凑出一份候选人名单，里面的人尽是早就为阿尔及利亚人民所不齿的民族叛徒，毫无代表性可言。法国的“解放报”说：戴高乐的整个计划已经遭到破产。
    最近法国政府又放出风声，表示愿意举行所谓“停火”谈判。然而，戴高乐的这个骗局，是非常拙劣的。他坚持并吞阿尔及利亚的反动政策，根本否定了阿尔及利亚独立的权利，因此，所谓“停火”就是要阿尔及利亚人民放弃民族解放斗争，向法国殖民主义投降。这当然是阿尔及利亚人民不能接受的。阿巴斯总理在临时政府成立后的政策声明中严正指出：“英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在他们的独立权利和主权得到正式承认以前，决不放下武器”。至于通过谈判和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，那是阿尔及利亚政府的一贯主张，临时政府已经声明，只要这个谈判的目的是求得政治解决，是在两个独立国家政府之间谈判的基础上进行的，它就准备和法国代表见面。这种严正的立场，粉碎了戴高乐的“停火”阴谋。
    阿尔及利亚人民斗争是艰巨的的，在他们胜利前进的道路上，还有很多困难，特别是因为美国从财政上和军火供应上支持法国。今年年初，当法国因战争而面临财政上崩溃的关头，就从美国得到了财政“援助”。阿尔及利亚共和国交通部长布苏夫最近发表谈话说：“在阿尔及利亚，我们差不多必须同美国人进行战争。差不多法国的所有武器和装备——从军服纽扣到粮食供应——都来自美国”。不过，美国支持法国的殖民战争的行为，教育了全体阿尔及利亚人民，使他们认清了美帝国主义者是民族解放运动最凶恶的敌人。
    阿尔及利亚人民正在团结在临时政府的周围，积极地支持和参加伟大的民族解放战争。他们能够在已经取得的胜利基础上，在世界人民的支持下，克服任何困难，创造更有利的条件，取得最后胜利。（附图片）
