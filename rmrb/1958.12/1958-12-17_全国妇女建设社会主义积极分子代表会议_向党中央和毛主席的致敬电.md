To the esteemed Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao:

We, the entire body of representatives attending the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Representative Conference, bring the sentiments of thousands upon thousands of women activists and the broad masses of women of all ethnic groups across the country to extend our most profound respects to the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao!

Under the illumination of the general line for socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our broad masses of women of all ethnic groups have actively plunged into the high tide of the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. We have enthusiastically participated in the people's commune movement and vigorously established collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and sewing factories. We feel that contributing our strength to the great socialist construction is the greatest glory. In collective production and collective life, our women have experienced great ideological liberation, great labor liberation, and made faster progress in politics, culture, and technology. Our social status has been further elevated, and our family life has become more democratic and united. We deeply realize that our happiness is obtained under the leadership, care, and encouragement of the Party. Only by following the Party and taking the socialist and communist road can women achieve complete liberation.

At this conference, the Party Central Committee has given us clear instructions and cordial teachings. We, representing the women activists and the broad masses of women of all ethnic groups across the country, guarantee to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will certainly follow the Party's instructions, work with the people of the whole country to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 national construction plan, wholeheartedly run the people's communes well, and strive for an even greater leap forward in socialist construction next year. We must also continue to work hard to fully build a socialist society and create conditions for the transition to a communist society. In order to accomplish this glorious and great task, we women must summon up our energy, work actively, and produce diligently; study politics and improve our communist consciousness; diligently study technology, learn culture, and improve our construction skills; and give fuller play to our strength on all fronts of socialist construction. We deeply appreciate the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's meticulous concern and consideration for the lives of the masses. We must abide by the Party's teachings, and while displaying soaring energy and working hard, we must vigorously run collective living welfare undertakings well, consciously pay attention to our health, and ensure safe production; so as to always maintain vigorous energy and ensure that the socialist construction cause continues to leap forward again and again.

Esteemed Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: The general line for socialist construction and the beautiful ideals of communism illuminate our hearts. The teachings, support, and encouragement given to us by the Party have increased our strength a hundredfold. We will always listen to the Party, and wherever the Party points, we will rush there. Under the leadership of the Party, we will unite the broad masses of women of all ethnic groups across the country and advance bravely on the road of socialism and communism!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!

Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!
