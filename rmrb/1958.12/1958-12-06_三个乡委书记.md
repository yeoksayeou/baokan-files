    Three Township Party Secretaries
    Jiang Zhishui
    In the days before I arrived in Xiyang, there had just been a light snowfall, but the accumulated snow had already decorated the Taihang Mountains in white. I walked along the clear Shunxi River, passed a high earthen mountain, and turned the bend to see a cluster of earthen furnaces at the edge of the village. There, the first person to greet me was Zhang Chenglan, the Deputy Party Secretary of Duzhuang Township.

    This was a short, slender man, humble and enthusiastic. He introduced me to everything about this mountain village that day. He had deep feelings for this village of only four thousand people, because he had grown up here and was originally the son of a hired laborer, and later became a hired laborer for a landlord. He had personally experienced all the hardships of this mountain village.

    What the Deputy Township Party Secretary talked about more was not his personal experience, but the other two secretaries in the township: one was First Secretary Zhao Shunyi; the other was Second Secretary and Township Head Wang Hengqing. The Deputy Secretary said: "The three of us came from the army and are very united. My health is not very good, and Lao Zhao and Hengqing take good care of me. They help me with some of the more strenuous work, and I only manage the iron factory in the eastern mountains and some of the farming." But the truth was not entirely so. A few days later, I saw that Lao Zhao and Hengqing were indeed very concerned about his health, but he himself did a lot of work. In the Party Committee, he was also in charge of organization, youth, and women's work. Countless people came to the township to find him every day, but they often couldn't find him, because he was either at the iron factory or in the fields.

    I met the Township Head at the coal mine, which was four or five miles away from the village. For those two days, more than a dozen iron smelters in the township were short of coal, and some even couldn't start their furnaces. In the morning, he led more than thirty people transferred from the mountains to the coal mine. Because he had worked in the mines in Yangquan for two years, he was considered an expert, and naturally became the leader of this coal mine.

    That evening, we returned to the village along the mountain road, and he took me to see the public canteens, kindergartens, and iron factories in several villages. We also went down into the dark caves to see the miners.

    Because we were walking along the mountain road, we had unknowingly walked seven or eight miles. We sat down on a rock to rest. He said to me with deep meaning: "It won't do, the situation is developing too fast now. In the past two years, I feel a little out of touch. When I was studying at the prefectural Party school during the democratic revolution, I felt very clear-sighted, but now I can't figure out many problems and I'm afraid to be certain. Fortunately, Lao Zhao is helping us, he really has a knack for it. You know, our mountain village is really remote and backward. Last year, we harvested a total of 1.79 million catties of grain, and we still have to mix some bran to eat every year. The problem of vegetables can't be solved either, the masses only eat some bean leaves..., but after Lao Zhao came to our place as secretary for a year or two, he figured out the situation here. He advocated close planting and personally went to the fields to plant double-seed corn. He visited old farmers to study the soil, seeds, and fertilizer in the mountainous areas. In May of this year, he proposed to plant radishes in all the cornfields to solve the problem of the masses eating vegetables. This had never been heard of before. I couldn't understand it at the time. Lao Zhao, Chenglan, and I held a meeting to discuss it, but the opinions were not unified, so we discussed it again at the Party Committee meeting. Finally, most people agreed with Lao Zhao's opinion, and that's how we started doing it. As a result, you have already seen that we have planted radishes in more than 3,000 mu of cornfields. This year's grain has more than quadrupled, with a total output of 5 million catties. The harvested radishes, based on each person in the village eating one catty a day, can still be sold to the state for 100,000 catties! This incident really educated me. Look, haven't I become a conservative!"

    I had already been staying with these two secretaries for a few days, but First Secretary Lao Zhao, who was attending the three-level cadre meeting in the county, still hadn't returned. He had been gone for more than ten days. But from the mouths of these two secretaries, it seemed that I already knew him very well.

    This morning, Lao Zhao rode back on his bicycle. He looked just like an ordinary farmer. Comrade Chenglan unloaded a bundle of award certificates and two large brocade banners from his bicycle for the people of the township. Lao Zhao himself also received many awards. People rummaged through his brand-new notebook, woolen clothes, towel, vest... It was said that this was not only to reward Lao Zhao for leading the township to achieve a double harvest of steel and grain, but also related to his special concern for the lives of people from other townships who came to support the launching of steel satellites.

    It turned out that more than a month ago, more than 400 people from other townships came to help them make steel. Lao Zhao convened a Party branch meeting in advance and asked everyone to take good care of these expeditionary forces. He personally arranged for these 400 people to sleep on warm brick beds and prepared grain and vegetables. Some people didn't have enough clothes to wear, so Lao Zhao organized the cadres to take out their own cotton-padded clothes and lend them to these out-of-towners, and also organized the families to sew clothes for the expeditionary forces. On the night before the expeditionary forces left, Lao Zhao also proposed to organize a gala, and the cultural and artistic talents from the township and the expeditionary forces performed programs. A pig and two sheep were slaughtered for a large feast. At the meeting, Lao Zhao thanked everyone for their support, and asked people to offer suggestions, but the guests all praised Lao Zhao and his colleagues for their good hospitality and style. After the meeting, it was already late at night. Under the leadership of Lao Zhao, the committee members of the Duzhuang Township Party and Youth League branches and the temporary Party and Youth League branches of the expeditionary forces were still summarizing the experience and gains of this collaboration.

    On the day Lao Zhao returned, many people passed by the township government and came in to see him, but as soon as he returned, he couldn't stay still. He left again before he could even eat.

    It wasn't until the evening that I had a chance to talk to him. I asked him where he had been during the day. He took a sip of water and said to me: "I just came down from Baiyang Ridge. I talked with the Party branch secretary there for an afternoon. Our branch secretary is an honest and hardworking comrade, but he's just not open-minded enough. He was originally leading an iron factory to make steel, but a few days ago he was transferred back to the mountains to engage in agricultural production, and he couldn't figure it out. He thought that the Party's main strength was now engaged in steelmaking, so why was he suddenly transferred to an unimportant position! Yes, our work was not meticulous enough, why didn't we explain it clearly beforehand! Our Party has never underestimated agricultural production! Fortunately, it's been explained now." As he spoke, a smile appeared on his face. I originally wanted to ask him to talk more about himself, how he fought guerrillas in the Taihang Mountains in those years; how he stayed by the furnace day and night when he was engaged in steelmaking a while ago... But all he talked about was the masses, his comrades, and the leadership of the Party. It seemed that I knew more about him than he did about himself.

    By the time I went to bed, it was already past twelve o'clock. The Deputy Secretary was holding a pen in one hand and an earphone in the other, participating in a telephone conference held in the county. When I woke up the next morning, it was still dark. I wanted to say goodbye to the three of them, but I was the only one left in the township government. Even the township secretary's bed was empty with only a quilt laid out. It turned out that at more than two o'clock last night, the county relayed an emergency call from the prefectural committee, saying that there would be a heavy wind and snow in a day or two, and all townships must find ways to collect the grain and firewood in the fields and on the threshing grounds. So Lao Zhao, Chenglan, Hengqing, and other cadres in the township went to the villages overnight to convey the instructions.

    Editor's Note: The comrades who have been sent down are about to leave the countryside one after another, returning to their original agencies or taking up new positions. How have they been trained in the year they have worked in the countryside? This is what everyone is concerned about. In this column, we will publish short articles written by some sent-down cadres one after another as a report to the people of the whole country. We hope that the comrades who have been sent down will all write.

    三个乡委书记
    江之水
    我到昔阳的前几天，这里刚下过一场不算很大的雪，然而积雪已经把太行山给装饰得花白花白的了。我沿着清澈的顺西河走着，又过了一座高大的土山，转过弯来就看到村边的一片土炉群。在那里，第一个招呼我的就是杜庄乡的党委副书记张成蓝。
    这是一个个儿不高、身体瘦弱的人，他谦虚而热情，当天就给我介绍了这山庄的一切。他对这个只有四千来人的山庄有着深厚的感情，因为他自小生长在这里，本来就是个雇工的儿子，大了又给地主当了雇工，他对这山庄的一切遭遇都有着亲身的体会。
    乡党委副书记给我讲的更多的不是他个人的经历，而是这乡里的另外两位书记，一位是第一书记赵顺义；一位是第二书记兼乡长王恒庆。副书记说：“我们三个人都是部队里下来的，团结得很紧。我身体不大好，老赵和恒庆很照顾我，有些吃力的工作他俩都帮我做了，我只管东山那一片铁厂和一些庄稼活。”可是事实并不完全如此，几天以后我看到老赵和恒庆对他的身体确是很关心，但他自己做的事情并不少。他在党委还分管组织、青年、妇女工作，来乡里找他的人一天不知有多少，可又常常找不到他，他忙得不是上铁厂就是下地了。
    我和乡长是在离村有四五里地远的煤窑上相识的。那两天，乡里十多个炼铁厂都缺少煤炭，有的甚至不能开炉了。早晨，他就带了从山上调下来的三十多个人下了煤窑。因为他过去在阳泉下过两年矿，算是个内行，也自然的成了这煤窑的领导人。
    那天黄昏，我们一路绕着山道回到村里来，他顺路引我看了几个村的公共食堂、幼儿园和铁厂。我们还下到漆黑的山洞里去看采矿的人们。
    因为绕山路走，不觉已经走了七八里路了，我们在一块山石上坐下来休息。他意味深长地跟我说：“不行啊，现在形势发展得太快，这两年我感到有点跟不上了。以前闹民主革命，我在地委党校学习觉得眼界非常清楚，可现在自己有许多问题都摸不透，不敢肯定。不过，所好的是有老赵帮助我们了，他可真有一套。你知道，俺这山庄，可真是又偏僻又落后，去年一共收了粮食一百七十九万斤，每年都还得掺着吃点糠。菜的问题也解决不了，群众只是吃些豆叶菜……，可是老赵来咱这当了一两年书记以后，他算把咱这地方的情况摸透了。他提倡密植，亲自下田去种双苗玉米，他访问老农研究山区的土质、种籽、肥料。今年5月，他又提出在所有的玉米地里都捎带着种上萝卜，来解决群众吃菜问题。这是从来没有听说过的事，我当时就闹不通，老赵、成蓝和我三个人开会研究时，意见不统一，就又在党委会上讨论，最后多数人都同意老赵的意见，就这样干起来了。结果，你也已经看到了，我们三千来亩玉米地都种了萝卜，今年的粮食翻了两番还多，总产量五百万斤，收下的萝卜，按村里每个人每天吃一斤算，还可以卖给国家十万斤呢！这件事可把我教育了，你看，俺这不成了个保守派了吗！”
    我和这两位书记已经在一起留连了几天了，可是往县里开三级干部会的第一书记老赵总是不回来，他去了已经十多天了。不过我从这两位书记的口里，好像对他已经很熟识了。
    今天早上，老赵骑着自行车回来了。看他那样子简直就是个普通的农民。成蓝同志从他车上解下来一捆乡里人们得的奖状和两面大锦旗。老赵个人也得了不少奖，人们翻弄着他那崭新的笔记本、绒衣、毛巾、背心……。听人说，这除了是奖励老赵领导全乡钢粮双丰收以外，还与他特别关心外乡来支援放钢铁卫星的人们的生活有关。
    原来，一个多月以前，外乡来了四百多人帮助他们炼钢，老赵事先召开了党支部会，让大家一定照顾好这些远征军。他亲自给这四百多人安排了睡热炕头，准备好了粮食和蔬菜。有人穿的衣服不够了，老赵就组织干部们把自己的棉衣拿出来借给这些外乡人，还组织了家属们给远征军缝补衣衫。远征军临走的那天晚上，老赵又提议组织了一个联欢晚会，本乡群众和远征军里的文娱能手都表演了节目，又杀了一头猪、两只羊，来个大会餐。老赵在会上感谢了大家的支援，又请人们提意见，可是客人们都异口同声地赞扬老赵他们的招待好，作风好。会后已是深夜了，在老赵的主持下，杜庄乡党团支部和远征军临时党团支部的委员们，还在总结这次协作的经验和收获。
    老赵归来的这一天，不知有多少群众路过乡政府都进来看看他，而他一回来就呆不住，连饭也顾不上吃就又走了。
    晚上，我才找到跟他谈心的机会，我问他白天到哪儿去了，他喝了口水跟我说：“我刚从白羊岭上下来，跟那里的党支部书记谈了一下午。我们这位支书是个老实肯干的同志，可就是心胸不够开阔。本来他也领导一个铁厂搞钢铁的，前几天又把他调回山上去搞农业生产，他就想不通了。他以为党的主要力量现在正搞钢铁，为什么突然把自己调到一个不重要的岗位上去了呢！是呀，我们的工作也做得太不细致了，为什么事先不交代清楚！对于农业生产我们党是从来没有轻视过啊！还好，现在说通了。”说着，他的脸上露出了微笑。我原想再请他谈谈自己，当年怎样在太行山打游击；谈谈前一阵子大搞钢铁时怎样地日夜不离炉，……可是他一谈就谈群众，谈同志，谈党的领导，关于他自己倒好像还没有我知道的多呢。
    等我睡下来，已经是深夜十二点多了。副书记正一手提笔，一手握着耳机参加县里召开的电话会议呢。第二天早上醒来，天还没大亮，我想向他们三位告别，可是乡政府却留下我一个人了，连乡秘书的床也空空地只铺着个被子。原来昨夜两点多，县里传来了地委的紧急电话，说一两天内将有大风雪，各乡地里和场上的粮食、柴草一定要设法收拾起来，于是连老赵、成蓝、恒庆三位书记，再加上乡里别的干部都连夜出动到各村去传达指示了。
    编者按：下放的同志们即将陆续离开农村，回到原来机关或者走上新的工作岗位了。他们在农村劳动了一年，锻炼得怎么样？这是大家都关心的。在这一栏里，我们将要陆续发表一些下放干部写的短文，作为向全国人民的汇报。我们希望下放的同志们都来写。
