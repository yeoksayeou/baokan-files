	Grasp Both Production and Life
	Representative of National Agricultural Advanced Units
	Secretary of the CCP Wuxiang County Committee, Shanxi Province, Wang Zhenguo
	The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The people's commune is the organizer of the people's production and life, and the fundamental purpose of developing production is to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of all members of society. When the Party leads the work of the commune, it must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life."
	However, in the past, our understanding of the production and life of the commune was incomplete. Under the circumstances of insufficient labor, we one-sidedly believed that the realization of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward mainly depended on the hard work of the masses, rather than focusing on improving labor organization and vigorously reforming tools. Secondly, after the realization of communal dining halls, we emphasized the collectivization of life, the militarization of organization, and the combatization of action, while neglecting to properly arrange the masses' labor, study, rest, and entertainment time. In terms of the dining halls, we did not pay attention to the diversification of meals. We treated the major life affairs of tens of thousands of people as the affairs of the stewards, mistakenly believing that the Party Committee only needed to grasp production and ideology, and separating production from life. Thirdly, in terms of management methods, we neglected to mobilize the masses for democratic management, but instead allowed the stewards and cooks to monopolize power.
	Now, we have studied the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session and, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, Party committees at all levels have personally and greatly grasped life, and in this short period of time, we have achieved great results. First, we have improved the organizational structure of life and welfare organizations from the county to the commune, and each level has designated a secretary to be in charge of life issues. Second, the County Committee led more than 300 cadres from county-level organs to go deep into the communes to listen to the opinions of the masses, and vigorously carried out rectification. According to possible conditions and starting from the benefit of production, we established and improved various systems. For example, a major day of rest is held once every half month, on which commune members can buy things, carry out cleaning and sanitation work, and engage in entertainment activities. Two meals with meat are guaranteed every month, ensuring that each person eats half a kilogram of pork every month. Menus are ordered every seven days to avoid repeated meals, ensuring that commune members sleep for eight hours every day, and political and cultural learning is carried out every three days... In order to better care for the lives of the masses and solve problems in a timely manner, county and township cadres and the masses formed a single stove, truly achieving eating, living, and working together. Third, a food management committee was elected, and Party members and members of the Communist Youth League who are supported by the masses, politically reliable, and capable of handling affairs, as well as outstanding figures among the masses, were placed in this important position. In this way, it has become universal: diversification of meals, mechanization of kitchen utensils (local machinery), technicalization of chefs, cleanliness of dining halls, democratization of management, and regular learning.
	This has not only not affected production, but has also greatly promoted production. Practice has proven that the instructions of the Party Central Committee are completely correct. "The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be."

    既要抓生产又要抓生活
    全国农业先进单位代表
    中共山西武乡县委书记  王振国
    党的八届六中全会决议指出：“人民公社是人民的生产和生活的组织者，而发展生产的根本目的是最大限度地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。党在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。”
    但是，我们过去对公社的生产和生活认识是不全面的。在劳力不足的情况下，片面地认为实现全面大跃进主要只是靠群众的苦干，而不是着重于改善劳动组织，大力改革工具。其次，在实现食堂化之后，多强调生活集体化、组织军事化、行动战斗化，而忽视妥善地安排群众的劳动、学习、休息和娱乐时间。在食堂方面没有注意饭菜多样化。把成千上万的群众生活大事，当成是事务长的事，误认为党委只要抓住了生产和思想就行了，将生产和生活隔裂了起来。再次，在管理的方法上，忽视发动群众民主管理，而是由事务长和炊事员独揽大权。
    现在，我们学习了六中全会的精神，根据中央的指示，各级党委亲自大抓了生活，在这不长的时间里已经收到了很大的效果。首先是从县到公社健全了生活福利组织机构，各级都确定了一个书记亲自主管生活问题。其二，县委带领县级机关三百余名干部深入公社听取群众意见，大力进行了整顿，根据可能的条件和从有利于生产出发，建立与健全了各种制度。如半月过一次大礼拜，这一天社员们可以买买东西，搞清洁卫生工作和从事娱乐活动。每月两会餐，保证每月每人吃到一斤猪肉，每七天订出一次饭单不吃重样饭，保证社员每天睡到八个小时，三天进行一次政治文化学习等……为了更好地关心群众生活，有问题及时解决，县、乡干部和群众合成了一个灶，真正作到了同吃同住同劳动。其三，选举了伙食管理委员会，把群众拥护、政治可靠、有办事能力的党团员和群众中的优秀人物放到这一重要岗位上来。这样，普遍作到了：饭菜多样化、灶具机械化（土机械）、厨师技术化、食堂清洁化、管理民主化、学习经常化。
    这样非但没有影响生产，而且大大促进了生产。实践证明了党中央的指示是完全正确的。“党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。”
