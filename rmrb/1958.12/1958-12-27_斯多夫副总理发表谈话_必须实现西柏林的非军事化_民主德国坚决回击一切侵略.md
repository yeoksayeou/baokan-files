Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 24th: GDR Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Stoph told a reporter from the German News Agency, "The resolutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris will not help ease, but will instead exacerbate, the tense situation in Europe."

Stoph said that the situation at this meeting showed that the imperialists of the United States and West Germany are focusing their main attention on strengthening the aggressive armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and intensifying preparations for launching an atomic war against socialist countries.

He continued, "This meeting once again proves that West Germany is gradually becoming the main atomic stronghold of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe. This is entirely in line with the Adenauer regime's attempt to turn West Germany into an atomic state. The policy of atomic armament in West Germany, pursued by West German leaders, will intensify the tense situation in Germany. Atomic armament of West Germany and peaceful reunification of Germany are two mutually exclusive things."

Stoph then emphasized that West German armaments have reached a dangerous level. There are now more than 200,000 people in the West German Bundeswehr. Led by former Hitler generals and SS officers, the Bundeswehr is gradually becoming the strongest army among all European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In addition to some corps under the control of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, German militarists are also building an aggressive army to launch a civil war, the so-called "People's Militia Defense Force." They intend to double the strength of the Federal Border Guard compared to the level in the summer of 1958.

Stoph said that the Soviet government's proposal to transform West Berlin from a center of provocation into a demilitarized, peaceful, and free city must be realized as a new step to ensure peaceful development and ease international tensions. However, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are trying to obstruct the implementation of these proposals.

Stoph emphasized, "Any actions that infringe upon the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, as well as all acts of aggression against it, will be resolutely repelled by the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet troops stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic to defend peace."

    斯多夫副总理发表谈话
    必须实现西柏林的非军事化
    民主德国坚决回击一切侵略
    新华社柏林24日电  德意志民主共和国副总理兼国防部长斯多夫对德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说：“北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议的决议不仅无助于缓和、反而会加剧欧洲的紧张局势。”
    斯多夫说，这次会议的情况表明，美国和西德的帝国主义分子把他们的主要注意力放在加强北大西洋公约组织的侵略性武装力量上，放在加紧准备对社会主义国家发动原子战争上。
    他接着说，这次会议再次证明，西德正逐渐变成北大西洋公约组织在欧洲的主要原子据点。这完全符合阿登纳政权企图把西德变为原子国家的愿望。西德头目执行的原子备战的政策，会加剧德国的紧张局势。原子武装西德与和平统一德国，是水火不相容的两回事。
    斯多夫接着强调指出，西德军备已经达到了危险的程度。现在西德联邦国防军共有二十多万人。由前希特勒将领和党卫军军官们领导的国防军逐渐成为北大西洋公约组织所有欧洲成员国军队中最强大的一支陆军。除了有一些受北大西洋公约组织支配的兵团之外，德国军国主义者又在建立一支用来发动内战的侵略军，即所谓的“民兵防务军”。他们打算把联邦边防军的力量比1958年夏天的水平增加两倍。
    斯多夫说，必须实现苏联政府关于把西柏林从挑衅的中心变为非军事的和平自由城市的建议，作为保障和平发展和缓和国际紧张局势的新步骤。但是，北大西洋公约组织国家却企图阻挠实现这些建议。
    斯多夫强调说：“它们侵犯德意志民主共和国主权的任何行为，以及一切侵略它的行为都将遭到德意志民主共和国国家人民军和驻扎在德意志民主共和国领土上捍卫和平的苏联军队的坚决回击。”
