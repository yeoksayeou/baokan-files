A short commentary:

    Produce More Good Cement
    China's rapidly developing construction undertakings require a large quantity of cement, and even more so, high-quality cement. This is a very important task that the Party and the state have put forward to the workers on the cement industry front, and it is also a glorious and arduous task for them. As far as the current situation is concerned, this year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, China's cement industry, like other production sectors, has leaped forward again and again, developing very rapidly, and has basically guaranteed the supply for China's various construction undertakings. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    However, if we compare the current cement production level with the huge scale of China's capital construction next year, we will find that the two are far apart, and there may be a situation of tight cement supply. Moreover, this year, in individual cement industrial enterprises, there was a time when low-quality phenomena appeared, which is worthy of our vigilance. In order to realize the grand plan of socialist construction in 1959, we must seriously treat the arduous and glorious task entrusted to the cement industry sector by the Party and the state, and ensure the production of more and better cement. This is an important issue that the cement industry sector must carefully study and summarize.
    This year, the supply of cement was originally tight. However, the Party teaches us that as long as we put politics in command, strengthen the Party's leadership, and launch a mass movement; as long as we emancipate our minds, break superstitions, and implement technological revolution; as long as we implement both large, medium, and small-scale projects, and both indigenous and foreign methods, in short, as long as we learn to walk on two legs, there will be a way. We followed the Party's instructions and did so, and it really worked. From 1952 to 1957, in five years, cement only increased by 1.4 times, but this year's cement production increased by more than 50% at once compared to last year.
    The achievements of 1958 are great, but there is no room for complacency. In order to complete even greater tasks, we should currently seriously check the shortcomings and weak links in this year's work, as well as the implementation of the Party's instructions, and summarize the experiences of the leap forward over the past year to prepare for a continued leap forward in 1959. Through this inspection, we must affirm our achievements, overcome our shortcomings and weak links, and systematically summarize our creative experiences, and further develop them in future work. In this way, we can find the objective laws of the movement, further grasp and apply these laws, avoid blindness in our work, and change the passive situation in our work.
    Next year, we must not only supply a large quantity of cement, but also supply high-quality cement. If we only talk about quantity and not quality, only seek speed and not perfection, if the outbound procedures are not strict, and low-grade cement is passed off as high-grade cement, and inferior products are sent to construction sites as excellent products, then what will be the result? At best, rework and waste will delay the construction period; at worst, it will cause incalculable disasters. This would unknowingly commit a serious error, and we should be highly vigilant about this.
    As Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us: We must despise difficulties strategically, and we must pay attention to difficulties tactically. At present, the workers and comrades on the cement industry front are full of enthusiasm, which is very good, but we must also pay attention to combining enthusiasm with scientific analysis and seeking truth from facts, and truly achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" in order to complete the greater production tasks for next year and forge ahead courageously.

### 多出好水泥

专栏：短评

    多出好水泥
    我国正在飞跃发展的各项建设事业，需要数量很多的水泥，更需要质量很好的水泥。这是党和国家向水泥工业战线上职工们提出的一项十分重要的任务，也是水泥工业战线上职工们的光荣而艰巨的任务。就目前情况来看，今年我国水泥工业，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，也像其它生产部门一样，一跃再跃，发展很快，对我国的各项建设事业，基本上保证了供应，这是十分可喜的现象。
    但是，如果把目前水泥的生产水平和明年我国基本建设的巨大规模相比，就会发现两者相差悬殊，可能出现水泥供应紧张的局面。而且今年在个别水泥工业企业中，曾经一度出现过质量低劣的现象，这是值得我们警惕的。为了实现1959年社会主义建设的宏伟计划，必须严肃地对待党和国家交给水泥工业部门的艰巨而光荣的任务，保证生产更多更好的水泥，这是水泥工业部门必须加以认真研究和总结的重要问题。
    今年，水泥的供应，本来也是紧张的。但是党教导我们说，只要政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动；只要解放思想，破除迷信，实行技术革命；只要实行大中小并举，土洋并举，总之只要学会两条腿走路，就有办法。我们遵照党的指示，这样做了，果真见效。从1952年到1957年，五年中只增加了水泥一点四倍，而今年的水泥产量却比去年一下子增加了50％以上。
    1958年的成绩很大，但丝毫不能自满。为了完成更大的任务，目前应当认真地把今年工作中的缺点和薄弱环节以及执行党的指示的情况好好检查一下，把一年来跃进的经验总结一下，为1959年继续跃进做好准备。通过这次检查，要肯定成绩，克服缺点和薄弱环节，并把创造性的经验加以系统的总结，在今后工作中进一步发挥。这样，就能找到运动的客观发展规律，进一步掌握运用这个规律，避免工作中的盲目性，改变工作中的被动局面。
    明年，不仅要供应数量很多的水泥，更要供应质量很好的水泥。假如只讲数量、不讲质量，只图快、不图好，出库手续不严，把低标号水泥冒充高标号水泥，把低劣的产品当作优良的产品发送给工地，那么所得的结果是什么呢？轻则返工浪费，延误工期；重则造成无法估计的灾祸。这就不知不觉的犯了严重错误，对此应该引起高度的警惕。
    正如毛泽东同志历来教导我们的：在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难。当前水泥工业战线上的职工同志们，干劲很足，这是非常好的，但也要注意把干劲和科学分析、和实事求是结合起来，真正作到“多快好省”，为完成明年更大的生产任务而奋勇前进。
