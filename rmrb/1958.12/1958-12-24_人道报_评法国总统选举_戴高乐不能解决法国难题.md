Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 22nd. "L'Humanité" commented today on De Gaulle's election as President of France, pointing out that this election is a new stage in the establishment of a dictatorial regime, but it cannot solve any of the problems that France urgently needs to solve.

"L'Humanité" said that considering the political situation and the way of voting, the outcome of the election was predictable. De Gaulle benefited from the advancement of reactionary forces in the country since the May events, as evidenced by the "referendum" and parliamentary elections.

The newspaper emphasized that the voting figures show that people are strongly opposed to personal autocracy. It is worth pointing out that the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party's presidential candidate, Marane, greatly exceeded the number of Communist Party voters. This proves that a large number of Republicans have recognized that the French Communist Party is the strongest bastion for defending democratic freedoms and the rights of workers.

"L'Humanité" pointed out that De Gaulle has now seized a key position wielding virtually unlimited power. The seriousness of this fact must not be underestimated. In the six months since he became the head of the French government, people have already seen in which direction he is conducting "arbitration."

The newspaper listed De Gaulle's "achievements." It said that the Algerian war continues, and threats to workers' freedom, the status of civil servants, secular education, and the democratic press are becoming increasingly rampant. The economic crisis is deepening, the cost of living is constantly rising, and the French government has not taken any measures sufficient to improve the situation. On the contrary, the French government has decided to freeze wages, increase taxes, allocate an additional 230 billion francs for the war budget, and cut civilian appropriations. (Attached image)

### “人道报”评法国总统选举  戴高乐不能解决法国难题

    “人道报”评法国总统选举
    戴高乐不能解决法国难题
    新华社巴黎22日电  “人道报”今天在评论戴高乐当选法国总统时指出，这次选举是建立专制政权的新阶段，但是它并不能解决法国迫切需要解决的任何问题。
    “人道报”说，考虑到政治形势和投票的方式，选举的结果是可以预先肯定的。戴高乐由于五月事件以来在国内出现的反动势力的推进而得到好处，“公民投票”和议会选举都证明了这一点。
    报纸着重指出，可是投票的数字表明人们坚强有力地反对个人专权。值得指出的是，共产党提名的总统候选人马兰所得的票数，大大超过共产党选举人的人数。这一点证明了，为数众多的共和人士已经认清，法国共产党是保卫民主自由和劳动者的权利的最坚强的堡垒。
    “人道报”指出，戴高乐现在已经窃居掌握实际上没有限制的大权的要职。这一事实的严重性是决不能低估的。自从他当法国政府首脑六个月以来，人们已经可以看出他是朝着什么方向进行“仲裁”的。
    报纸历数了戴高乐的“政绩”。它说，阿尔及利亚战争始终在继续进行，对工人自由、对公务人员的地位、对世俗化教育以及民主报刊的威胁日益猖獗。经济危机正在加深、生活费用不断上涨，而法国政府没有采取足以改善局势的任何措施。恰恰相反，法国政府决定冻结工资、增加捐税、为战争预算增拨二千三百亿法郎并削减民用拨款。（附图片）
