Sea harbor fish farming is a promising new industry. It has more advantages than freshwater fish farming, is more stable than capture fisheries, can cultivate a greater variety of products, has lower production costs, and allows for harvesting at any time as needed, adjusting market supply.

This industry has attracted the attention of coastal areas. Guangdong Province recently proposed that aquaculture should take sea harbor fish farming as the "marshal"; Hebei Province is also vigorously carrying out capital construction for sea harbor fish farming this winter, preparing to open up hundreds of thousands of acres of sea harbor fish farming bases.

Sea harbor fish farming in China has a history of two or three hundred years. Guangdong fishermen call it "fish ponds," Fujian calls it "sea embankments," and fishermen in northern provinces generally call it "harbor farming." The Chinese people have long known how to use small and medium-sized coastal harbors and coves to build artificial dikes and set up sluice gates for fish farming; or in wasteland and low-lying areas where seawater and freshwater meet, they dig ditches, enclose land, build dikes, and set up sluice gates to accumulate seawater, using the tides to bring in fish fry for artificial management and breeding. However, due to the large water surface area, often spanning several districts and townships, it was impossible to achieve great development under the past system of private land ownership. At present, sea harbor fish farming is most developed in Haifeng, Baoan, and Leizhou counties in Guangdong, and the Old Xingang in Hebei is the most famous. Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian also have a few areas engaged in it. Sea harbor fish farming can utilize the habit of fish migrating to nearshore areas to spawn, naturally drawing water and fish fry into the breeding grounds with the rise and fall of the tide. At the same time, the area where seawater and freshwater meet is rich in feed, so the equipment is simple, it does not require much labor, and the results are quick. Many precious fish and shrimp from the deep sea can be inclusively raised, growing fat and large in just a year and a half, ready for harvesting at any time.

Turning wild creatures into domestic animals, replacing hunting with animal husbandry, is a law that allows mankind to fully utilize the growth of animals and plants in nature. In the production of marine aquatic products, this law has long been neglected. Generally, scholars and experts have always emphasized that marine fisheries are an extractive production, believing that the ocean is vast and boundless, and that aquatic resources are inexhaustible and can be harvested at will, without the need to waste manpower on breeding. However, the migration of marine fish is often affected by the wind, tides, and temperature of nature, which are varied and unpredictable. Therefore, it is not entirely appropriate to compare marine fisheries to an extractive industry. Sea harbor fish farming, however, can produce in large quantities under human control, unlike the difficulty of stabilizing the abundance of capture fisheries.

Developing sea harbor fish farming also has more favorable conditions than freshwater fish farming. First, the water source is abundant, and the rise and fall of the tides ensure the flow and freshness of seawater, avoiding the difficulty of insufficient water sources often encountered in freshwater fish farming due to drought, or the need for manual and frequent replenishment of new water to raise fish well. Second, feed is abundant. Sea harbor fish farming is located at the junction of fresh and brackish water areas, and the large amount of natural feed carried by large and small rivers can continuously supply the needs of fish and shrimp. If intensive farming and feeding are implemented, the large number of wild, low-value shellfish and algae products along the coast can fully meet the requirements, unlike freshwater fish farming, which requires supplying a large amount of feed and consuming a lot of labor. At the same time, the source of seedlings for sea harbor fish farming is abundant. Mullet, grey mullet, and various shrimp and crab seedlings are everywhere and can be raised locally. The mullet seedlings included in Hebei Province this year can not only meet the needs of the province but also supply the needs of Inner Mongolia and other places. The development of freshwater fish farming must master a large number of seedlings, whether naturally collected or artificially hatched, which requires a certain amount of manpower, financial resources, and material resources.

Some people believe that the infrastructure construction for sea harbor fish farming is large, labor-intensive, and not cost-effective. This view is incorrect. The construction of an approximately 8,000-mu fish farming harbor in Qisha Town, Fangcheng County, Guangxi, only required more than 30,000 workdays, which is much less labor-intensive than freshwater fish farming. Of course, some projects may be larger, but as long as we can fully mobilize the masses, make plans, and carry out capital construction in phases and batches according to the actual manpower and financial resources of various places, building those that are easy to build and produce results quickly first, and then building those that are labor-intensive, the development of sea harbor fish farming will have a solid foundation.

Some people say that the yield of sea harbor fish farming is not high and the income is low. This is a misconception formed by the backward farming methods of relying on the weather in the past. Today, with the entire party mobilized and the soaring enthusiasm of the people, using the wisdom of the masses, the increase in yield has far exceeded the norm. As long as the farming methods are slightly improved, the yield can be greatly increased. Kangling Township, Qin County, Guangdong, can achieve a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu after improving the sea harbor fish farming production methods. If we promote intensive stocking of fish fry, carry out artificial management, and implement measures such as feeding refined feed, each mu can produce 10,000 to 20,000 jin, and the income per mu can be 2,000 to 4,000 yuan. This income certainly cannot be said to be low.

China's sea harbor aquaculture has great potential and broad development prospects. It is estimated that at least 15 million mu of sea harbor water area in the country can be used to raise fish and shrimp. If all of it is utilized, with an average yield of one ton per mu, it will exceed the current total output of marine fishing. At present, local Party committees and administrations have already started to grasp this work, so it has become possible to achieve this goal in the short term. The collection and reproduction of seedlings for sea harbor aquaculture has entered a new stage. The number of new cultivable species such as various fish, shrimp, crabs, and sea cucumbers is rapidly increasing. For some species, artificial control of spawning and incubation and artificial hybridization have been successful, which has created very favorable conditions for the development of sea harbor fish farming.

    海港养鱼是发展水产事业的新方向
    刘向文
    海港养鱼是一项极有发展前途的新兴事业。它比淡水养鱼有更多的有利条件，比捕捞生产稳定，养殖的东西可以多种多样，生产成本又低，还可以按照需要随时捞取，调剂市场供应。
    这项事业已引起沿海各地的重视。广东省最近提出水产养殖要以海港养鱼为元帅；河北省今冬也在大搞海港养鱼的基本建设工作，准备开辟数十万亩的海港养鱼基地。
    海港养鱼在我国已有二、三百年的历史。广东渔民把它叫做“鱼塭”，福建叫“海埭”，北方各省渔民习惯称为“港养”。我国人民早就知道利用沿海的中小型港湾、港?，进行人工筑堤设闸来养鱼；或者是在海、淡水交接地带的荒滩洼地，开沟围地，筑堤设闸，积蓄海水，利用潮汐纳进鱼苗进行人工管理养殖。但由于水面较大，往往跨有几个区乡，在过去土地私有制的情况下，就不可能得到很大的发展。目前，全国以广东的海丰、宝安、雷东等县的海港养鱼最发达，以河北的老新港为最有名，山东、辽宁、福建也有少数地区在进行。海港养鱼可以利用鱼类洄游到近海产卵的习性，就着海潮的涨落，自然地向养殖场所纳水纳苗。同时海、淡水交接地带饲料丰富，所以设备既简单，花费劳动力不多，收效又快。许多深海的名贵鱼虾，都可以兼收并蓄，放养一年半载即可成长肥大，以供随时取用。
    化野生为家养，以养畜代捕猎，是人类对大自然生长的动植物能够充分利用的一个规律。在海洋水产品的生产上，这个规律却长期被忽视。一般学者专家都一直强调海洋渔业是一种采掘性的生产，认为海洋浩大无边，水产资源可以取之不尽用之不竭，任其自生自长加以捕捞就可以了，不必浪费人力饲养。但是海洋鱼类的洄游常受大自然的风力、潮流、气温的影响而变化多端，因此把海洋渔业比作采掘工业是不完全恰当的。而海港养鱼，却能够在人力控制的条件下大量生产，不像捕捞生产的丰歉难于稳定。
    发展海港养鱼还具有比淡水养鱼更有利的条件，首先是水源充足，潮汐涨落保证了海水的流动与新鲜，不会像淡水养鱼常因天旱发生水源不足的困难，或需要人力经常补充新水，才能把鱼养好。其次是饲料丰富，海港养鱼地处淡咸水交界地区，大小江河夹带的大量天然饲料，可以源源不断地供应鱼虾类食用的需要。如果要实行密养多喂，沿海大量野生的低值贝藻类产品也完全可以满足要求，不像淡水养鱼那样，要供应大量的饲料，消耗很多的劳动力。同时，海港养鱼，苗种来源充足，鮻鱼、鲻鱼和各种虾蟹类的苗种到处都是，均可就地取材加以饲养。河北省今年纳入的鮻鱼苗，不仅能满足本省需要，还能供应内蒙古等地要求。而淡水养鱼的发展必须掌握为数极多的苗种，不论天然采补或是人工孵化，都需要花费一定的人力、财力和物力。
    有些人认为海港养鱼的基建工程大，费力多，不合算。这种看法是不正确的。广东防城县企沙镇建设一个八千亩左右的养鱼海港，所费的建设工程仅三万多个工，这比淡水养鱼费工少得多。当然也有些工程可能要大些，但是只要我们能够充分发动群众，做出规划，按照各地人力财力的实际情况，分期分批地进行基本建设，先建那些容易建、收效快的，后建那些费工大的。建好一港利用一港，逐步把能够利用的港湾都建设起来，海港养鱼的发展就有了可靠基础。
    有些人说海港养鱼产量不高，收入少，这是过去靠天吃饭的落后养殖方法所形成的错觉。今天，全党动手加上全民的冲天干劲，运用群众智慧，产量的提高已经远远地打破了常规。只要养殖方法稍加改善，就可大大提高产量。广东钦县康岭乡在改善海港养殖生产方法后，可达到亩产千斤以上。如果我们推广密放鱼苗、进行人工管理、投饵精养等措施，每亩生产可达一两万斤，每亩收益就有二千元至四千元，这个收入当然就不能说少了。
    我国的海港养殖存在着很大的潜力和广阔的发展前途。估计全国至少有一千五百万亩海港水面可以利用养殖鱼虾，只要全部利用起来，平均亩产一吨，就超过了现在海洋捕捞的总产量。目前，各地党委和行政已经动手抓这一工作，因而在短期内实现这个指标，已经成为可能。当前海港养殖的种苗采集和繁殖，已经进入了一个新的阶段。各种鱼、虾、蟹类和海参等新的可养品种迅速增加。有些品种，人工控制产卵孵化及人工杂交已经取得成功，这些都为发展海港养鱼创造了十分有利的条件。（附图片）
