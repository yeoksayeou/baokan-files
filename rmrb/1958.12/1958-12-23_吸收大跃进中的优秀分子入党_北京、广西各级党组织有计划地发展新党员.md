From "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes":
    It is necessary to thoroughly rectify the Party organizations and the commune organizations, ensuring that the leading members at all levels of the Party and the commune must be active elements who are loyal to the interests of the people and the cause of communism, and to absorb outstanding elements who have been tested in the Great Leap Forward movement and the communization movement and who meet the standards of Party members into the Party.

    Absorbing Outstanding Elements from the Great Leap Forward into the Party
    Beijing and Guangxi Party Organizations at All Levels Systematically Develop New Party Members

Xinhua News Agency report: Beijing's Communist Party organizations at all levels are systematically admitting active elements who have emerged in the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production into the Party organization. To date, more than 2,000 people have been admitted into the Party this year.

    These new Party members have generally undergone long-term cultivation by the Party and have been tested in various movements. They have a firm stance, can closely connect with the masses, and possess a relatively high level of communist consciousness. Among the 48 new Party members recently admitted in Xicheng District, 40 have outstanding inventions, creations and advanced deeds, including national trade union activists, advanced workers, and shock workers. Sun Peisen, a new Party member from the Beijing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company Component Factory, is a representative of the National Youth Activists Congress. He has consistently been active in various social works and past movements. After the Party proposed the call for multi-skilled workers, he studied diligently and quickly mastered six skills, including car driving, mechanical repair, and concrete mixing.

    Many units' work on developing Party members is led by the Party Committee Secretary, mobilizing the entire Party's strength. These units have conducted strict investigations and examinations of new Party members to ensure their quality. The Party Committee Secretary and branch secretaries of the Beijing Radio Factory personally oversee the work of Party building. Therefore, the quality of Party members admitted by this factory in the second half of the year is generally good. The work of developing new Party members has also greatly promoted production. After Wenquan Township in Haidian District admitted 36 new Party members, not only did the new Party members play a greater role in their work, but they also encouraged the political enthusiasm of the broad masses, completing the autumn harvest in a timely manner and over fulfilling the deep plowing task.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: Party organizations at all levels in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have recently combined the nationwide summing-up and evaluation of the double harvest of steel and grain to admit a group of active elements who have been tested and meet the conditions of Communist Party members into the Communist Party of China.

    According to statistics from the end of November, a total of 9,466 new Party members from the Zhuang, Han, Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic groups have been developed throughout the region.

    The vast majority of these new Party members are meritorious models from the industrial and agricultural fronts and other work positions. According to a survey of 34 new Party members in the Nuanhe Steel Plant in Huanjiang County, 10 of them were awarded special-class merit, and 24 were awarded first-class merit. All 225 new Party members developed in Lingui County were meritorious models. Leading cadres at all levels and female Party members also accounted for a certain proportion of the new Party members. Among the 157 new Party members in Huanjiang County, 129 were cadres above the team leader level. Female Party members generally account for about one-third of the newly admitted members in various places.

    Before admitting new Party members, various localities conducted widespread communist ideological education among the masses. The Du'an and Mashan collaborative districts also printed more than 5,000 copies of "Party Building Reference Materials," more than 10,000 copies of introductions to the exemplary deeds of Party members, and more than 10,000 large-character posters and slogans to promote basic knowledge of the Party. In some construction sites and communes, amateur Party schools were established to attract Communist Youth League members and active elements to participate in learning. At the same time, in various movements, Party organizations at all levels consciously assigned trainees to various arduous work positions and leadership positions to train their ability to work independently and their style of connecting with the masses. The Hongxing Iron Factory in Liuzhou City arranged for trainees to serve as platoon leaders in various combat platoons, and they all excellently completed their tasks and received training. When handling the formalities for new Party members to join the Party, some places also widely solicited the opinions of the masses on the development targets and carried out criticism and self-criticism to ensure the quality of new Party members.

    要切实整顿党的组织和公社的组织，保证党和公社的各级领导成员必须是忠实于人民利益和共产主义事业的积极分子，并且吸收在大跃进运动和公社化运动中受过考验、合乎党员标准的优秀分子入党。
                       ——摘自“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”
    吸收大跃进中的优秀分子入党
    北京、广西各级党组织有计划地发展新党员
    据新华社讯  北京市各级中共党组织有计划的接收在整风、反右派斗争和工农业生产大跃进中涌现出来的积极分子加入党的组织。到目前为止，全市今年被吸收入党的已经有二千多人。
    这些新党员一般都经过党的长期培养和历次运动的考验，立场坚定，能密切联系群众，具有较高的共产主义觉悟。西城区最近吸收的四十八个新党员中，有四十名有突出的发明创造和先进事迹，其中有全国工会积极分子，先进工作者，突击手等。北京市第二建筑工程公司构件厂新党员孙培森是全国青年积极分子代表大会代表，他几年来在各项社会工作和历次运动中一贯积极，在党提出多面手的号召后，他苦学苦练很快掌握了汽车司机、机械检修、混凝土搅拌等六种技术。
    许多单位发展党员工作都是党委书记挂帅，动员全党的力量来进行的。这些单位都对新党员进行了严格的考察审查，保证了新党员的质量。北京有线电厂党委书记、支部书记都亲自抓建党工作，因此，这个厂下半年接收的党员，质量一般都好。发展新党员的工作还大大推动了生产。海淀区温泉乡吸收了三十六名新党员后，不但新党员在工作中发挥了更大积极性，而且鼓舞了广大群众的政治热情，及时完成了秋收和超额完成了深翻地的任务。
    据新华社南宁电  广西僮族自治区各级党组织最近结合钢铁、粮食两丰收的全民总结、评比工作，接收了一批经过考验、具备共产党员条件的积极分子加入中国共产党。
    据11月底的统计，全区共发展僮、汉、苗、瑶、侗各族新党员九千四百六十六名。
    这一批新党员中，绝大部分是工农业战线和其他工作岗位上的功臣模范。据环江县暖和钢铁厂对三十四名新党员的调查，其中立特等功的十名，立甲等功的二十四名。临桂县新发展的二百二十五名党员，全部都是功臣模范。新党员中各级领导骨干和妇女党员也都占一定的比重。环江县一百五十七名新党员中，有一百二十九名是队长以上的骨干。各地新接收的妇女党员一般在三分之一左右。
    各地在接收新党员以前，对群众广泛进行了共产主义思想教育。都安、马山协作区还印发了五千多份“建党参考材料”、一万多份党员模范事迹介绍和一万多张大字报、标语，宣传党的基本知识。在一些工地和公社，举办了业余党校，吸收共青团员和积极分子参加学习。同时在各种运动中，各级党组织还有意识地分配培养对象到各种艰巨的工作岗位和领导岗位上，锻炼他们独立工作的能力和联系群众的作风。柳州市红星铁工厂将培养对象安排到各战斗排担任排长，他们都出色地完成了自己的任务，受到了锻炼。在办理新党员入党手续时，一些地方还广泛听取群众对发展对象的意见，开展批评与自我批评，保证了新党员的质量。
