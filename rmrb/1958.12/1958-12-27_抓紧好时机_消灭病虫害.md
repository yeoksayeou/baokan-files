Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 26th: A major battle to eliminate overwintering pests and diseases has begun in various parts of Gansu. Counties such as Dangchang, Zhenyuan, Kangxian, Huining, Xili, Qin'an, Wushan, Gangu, and Anxi have established pest control agencies from top to bottom, trained a large number of technicians, and are actively carrying out pest and disease prevention and control work. The Red Flag People's Commune in Anning District, Lanzhou City, has carried out a series of pest control and frost prevention measures on more than 70,000 apple and pear trees, including removing residual branches and dead leaves, scraping off old bark, deep plowing of orchards, repairing trellises, whitewashing trunks, wrapping young trees, and spraying with lime sulfur mixture. The Donggang District of the city also held an on-site meeting for cadres of various communes at the Yantan People's Commune, summarizing and promoting the experience of eliminating pests and diseases over the past few years, and formulating effective measures for pest and disease prevention and control. Dangchang County, based on the principle of "comprehensive prevention and control, combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive elimination, and focusing on major pests," has already produced more than 4.5 million catties of indigenous pesticides, of which more than 3.4 million catties have been applied to the soil. The Chongfeng People's Commune in Zhenyuan County used indigenous pesticides to control wheat dwarf disease on more than 1,400 mu of winter wheat, with an average insecticidal efficiency of 95%.

In the past, many places in Gansu Province had experience in eliminating overwintering pests and diseases. For example, in the winter of 1957 in Anxi County, due to the thorough digging and burning of *Achnatherum splendens* clumps on wheat field ridges and the uprooting of cotton stalks, the damage rate of wheat thrips this year decreased from 20% last year to 6%, and cotton Verticillium wilt decreased from 35% last year to 12%. This shows that winter is a good season for eliminating pests and diseases that is both effective and simple and saves labor. Therefore, this winter, all localities are full of enthusiasm and vigor in eliminating pests and diseases.

    抓紧好时机  消灭病虫害
    据新华社兰州26日电  一场消灭越冬病虫害的大战已开始在甘肃各地展开。宕昌、镇原、康县、会宁、西礼、秦安、武山、甘谷、安西等地，都已由上而下，层层设立了灭虫机构，训练了大批技术人员，积极进行防治病虫害的工作。兰州市安宁区红旗人民公社，已对七万多棵苹果与梨树进行了清除残枝枯叶，刮除老树皮，深翻园地，修整架条，涂白树干，包扎幼树，喷射白硫合剂等一系列的防虫防冻工作。这个市的东岗区还在雁滩人民公社召开各公社干部的现场会议，总结推广了几年来消灭病虫害的经验，制订了防治病虫害的有效措施。宕昌县本着“全面防治、土洋结合、全面消灭、重点肃清”的方针，已经自制出土农药四百五十多万斤，其中的三百四十多万斤已经施入地内。镇原县冲锋人民公社，用土农药在一千四百多亩冬麦地内防治红矮病，杀虫效率一般达到95％。
    甘肃省不少地方过去就有消灭越冬病虫害的经验，如安西县在1957年冬，由于彻底挖烧了麦田地埂的芨芨墩和棉秆连根挖掉，今年麦椿象的为害率就由去年的20％降低到6％，棉花黄萎病由去年的35％降低到12％。这说明，冬天是消灭病虫害既有效而又简便省工的好季节。因此，今冬各地在消灭病虫害中，群情风发，干劲十足。
