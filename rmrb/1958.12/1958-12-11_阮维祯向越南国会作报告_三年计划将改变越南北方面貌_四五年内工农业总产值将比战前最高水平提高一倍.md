Nguyen Duy Trinh said that the above indicators have important political significance, which embodies the fighting will of the Vietnamese people and the rapid pace of North Vietnam's advance towards socialism. Nguyen Duy Trinh said that at this rate, the total output value of industry and agriculture in Vietnam will double the pre-war peak level in four or five years. Nguyen Duy Trinh said, "By that time, the face of North Vietnam will undergo significant changes."

In his report, Nguyen Duy Trinh emphasized the importance of developing the agricultural cooperation movement to the entire agricultural development of Vietnam. He said that according to the requirements of the three-year plan, primary cooperation will be basically realized in agriculture in the next two years, and some primary agricultural cooperatives will be transformed into advanced agricultural cooperatives.

Nguyen Duy Trinh said: Vietnam is advancing from a backward agricultural economic foundation, and it is necessary to realize this plan with doubled new labor.

    据新华社河内9日电  越南总理府部长阮维祯9日在越南国会第九次会议上说，根据发展和改造经济、发展文化的三年（1958—1960年）计划，到1960年，越南工农业总产值将比1957年增长78％，每年平均增长21.2％。
    阮维祯在他的关于三年计划的报告中说，这个计划是根据群众运动的迅速发展和出现新的革命干劲的情况修订的。根据计划，到1960年，农业产值将增长73.6％，工业和手工业产值增长86.4％，现代工业产值增长169％。在工农业总产值中，农业将占64.7％，工业和手工业占35.3％，其中，现代工业占14.4％。
    到1960年，全北越谷类年产量将达到七百六十万吨，按人口平均每人每年可分到五百公斤，比1957年增长将近一倍。
    阮维祯说，上述指标具有重要的政治意义，它体现了越南人民的斗争意志和越南北方向社会主义前进的迅速步伐。阮维祯说，按照这种速度前进，四、五年内越南工农业总产值将比战前最高水平提高一倍。阮维祯说，“到了那时候，越南北方的面貌将发生显著的变化。”
    阮维祯在报告里强调了发展农业合作化运动对越南整个农业发展的重要意义。他说，根据三年计划的要求，在最近两年内，在农业方面基本实现初级合作化，并且把一部分初级农业社转为高级农业社。
    阮维祯说：越南是从落后的农业经济基础上出发前进的，要用加倍的新型的劳动来实现这个计划。
