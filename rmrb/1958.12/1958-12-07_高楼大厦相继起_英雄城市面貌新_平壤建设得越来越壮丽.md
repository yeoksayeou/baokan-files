Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 4th: Our correspondent reports: Pyongyang's urban construction is progressing at the speed of the Chollima. From the beginning of this year to December 1st, 17,282 housing units have been completed in this heroic city. Construction workers are confidently aiming to complete 20,000 housing units within the year, which is more than three times the number of housing units built last year.

Since the beginning of this year, Pyongyang's cityscape has become even more magnificent. On both sides of Stalin Street, which is 2.4 kilometers long in the city center, and People's Army Street, which is over one kilometer long, five- to six-story high-rise buildings have been erected. The new high-rise buildings completed this year include: the Academy of Sciences building, the Korean Central News Agency building, the largest department store in Pyongyang – the department store in front of the station, the main building of Kim Chaek University of Technology, the Pyongyang Railway Station building, etc.

East Pyongyang, which was severely damaged by the indiscriminate bombing of the American invaders during the war, now has a network of newly built streets. On both sides of Youth Road, the main street built this year, many six-story residential buildings have already been erected. The largest residential building in Korea, capable of accommodating more than 600 households, was completed as early as this spring. Even on the highest sixth floor of these residential buildings, there are "ondol" (Korean heated floor system) that the Korean people love. By the end of this year, a large number of employee families will move into these comfortable new homes.

Pyongyang's urban transportation is also developing rapidly. The construction of a 44-kilometer-long circular tram line started in November. By May 1st, 1960, trams capable of carrying 300 passengers at a time will begin to run around Pyongyang. On the Taedong River, Korea's largest concrete bridge, 680 meters long and 28.5 meters wide, capable of accommodating six cars in parallel, is under construction. The workers are determined to complete the bridge one year ahead of schedule so that the marching队伍(parade formation) participating in next year's celebration of the 14th anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea on "August 15th" can pass over the bridge.

The rapid development of urban construction in Pyongyang is inseparable from the rapid improvement of the construction technology of Pyongyang's construction departments. The prefabricated building method and mechanized operation, which were widely promoted by the construction departments based on the resolution of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee's plenary session in October last year, are the main technological innovation measures they have adopted. Song De-hun, the manager of the Pyongyang Second Construction Company and a Labor Hero, told reporters: Last year, the company had 3,400 employees and built a total of 416 housing units. This year, although the number of employees has been reduced to more than 1,500, due to the implementation of the prefabricated building method and the promotion of mechanization, by the end of November, 2,340 housing units had been completed, which is equivalent to five times that of last year.

Students and office workers in Pyongyang have played a huge role in urban construction. In the spring and summer of this year, university students and office workers in Pyongyang built two very long granite embankments along the banks of the Taedong River within the urban area of Pyongyang, and built many clean and beautiful parks on this famous riverbank.

### 高楼大厦相继起  英雄城市面貌新  平壤建设得越来越壮丽

    高楼大厦相继起  英雄城市面貌新
    平壤建设得越来越壮丽
    据新华社平壤4日电  本社记者报道：平壤的城市建设正以千里马的速度在进行中。从今年年初到12月1日为止，在这个英雄城市中已经建成了一万七千二百八十二户住宅，建筑工人们正满怀信心地要在年内建成两万户住宅，这个数字相当于去年建成的住宅户数的三倍以上。
    今年以来，平壤市的面貌变得更加宏伟壮丽了。在市中心区的长达二点四公里的斯大林大街和长度在一公里以上的人民军大街两旁，已经全部建起了五层到六层的高楼大厦。今年新建成的高大建筑有：朝鲜科学院大厦、朝鲜中央通讯社大楼、平壤最大的百货商店——车站前面的百货大楼、金策工业大学的主楼、平壤车站大楼等。
    在战时由于美国侵略者滥肆轰炸而遭到严重破坏的东平壤，新修筑的街道目前纵横交错；在今年修筑的主要街道——青年路两旁，已经高高耸起许多座六层住宅大楼。一座朝鲜最大的能容六百多户的住宅大楼早在今春就已经建成。在这些住宅大楼中，即使在最高的六层楼上，也设有朝鲜人民喜爱的火炕。在今年年底以前，将有大批职工家庭迁入这些舒适的新居。
    平壤市的城市交通事业也在迅速发展。一条长达四十四公里的环城电车道在11月开始动工兴建，到1960年“五一”劳动节，一次能载运三百名乘客的电车就将开始环绕平壤行驶。在大同江上，一座六百八十公尺长、二十八点五公尺宽、能够并行六辆汽车的朝鲜最大的混凝土结构桥梁正在兴建，工人们决心要提前一年建成这座桥梁，使参加明年庆祝“八一五”苏军解放朝鲜十四周年的游行队伍能够从桥上通过。
    平壤城市建设的飞跃发展是和平壤市建设部门的建筑技术的迅速提高分不开的。建设部门根据朝鲜劳动党中央去年十月全会的决议广泛推广的装配式建筑法和操作机械化，是它们采取的主要技术革新措施。平壤第二建筑公司的经理、劳动英雄宋德熏对记者说：这个公司在去年有三千四百名职工，共建设了四百十六户住宅；今年，职工人数虽然减少到一千五百多人，但是由于推行了装配式建筑法和推广了机械化，到11月底为止，就已经建成了二千三百四十户住宅，相当于去年的五倍。
    平壤市的学生和机关工作人员在城市建设中发挥了巨大作用。今年春夏两季，平壤的大学生和机关工作人员在平壤市区内的大同江两岸修起两条很长的花岗岩岸堤，并且在这条著名的江畔建成了许多整洁而优美的公园。
