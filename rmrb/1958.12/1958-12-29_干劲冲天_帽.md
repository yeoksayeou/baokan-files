    "Soaring Enthusiasm" Hat
    Zhaoyang
    The Zhuang people in our area like to wear a kind of fine bamboo rain hat. It's smaller than the Han Chinese's bamboo hat but larger than a straw hat, suitable for both sunny and rainy weather. Moreover, because it is exquisitely woven and beautiful, people carry it with them when they go out. It is both a tool and an ornament.

    The idea of writing "Soaring Enthusiasm" on the bamboo hat originated from a remark made by the county Party secretary. At a rally calling for the Great Leap Forward, the county Party secretary said: "We must use soaring enthusiasm to change the face of our county!" After hearing this report, someone, to express their determination, wrote "Soaring Enthusiasm" on their bamboo hat, which they always carried. Subsequently, many people followed suit, writing these words on their bamboo hats. For a time, wearing the "Soaring Enthusiasm" hat became a trend.

    This hat is not something one can wear casually. First of all, the wearer must truly have soaring enthusiasm. If their enthusiasm is lacking, the masses will not approve. Therefore, those who lack enthusiasm are embarrassed to write these words on their bamboo hats.

    There was a young commune member named Qin Yian, nicknamed "Grass Fire," meaning he blazed fiercely but quickly burned out and extinguished. He was the same way with his work; he started with great energy, shouting louder than anyone, but before long, his enthusiasm would disappear. He considered himself very active, but the masses never selected him as an activist. His wife, Wei Dilai, was the leader of the Youth League group and had argued with him countless times about this shortcoming.

    When the county built the Wanbao Mountain Reservoir, each commune sent workers to participate. Qin Yian was the first to sign up, thinking: This time, I'll get to wear the "Soaring Enthusiasm" hat. He bought a new bamboo hat, took it home, and dipped a large brush full of ink, ready to write on it.

    Dilai was packing his clothes and luggage and quickly stepped forward, reaching out to take the bamboo hat away, saying, "You can't just write on it yourself." Yian stared and said, "What, do you need approval to be an activist?" Dilai said, "Yes, you need approval. Approval from the masses, not self-approval." Yian said, "I was the first to sign up to participate in building the reservoir, don't I deserve to wear the 'Soaring Enthusiasm' hat?" Dilai said, "Signing up first is good, but just signing up doesn't count; it depends on how you perform on the construction site." Yian patted his chest and said, "You don't have to worry about that. I guarantee to bring back a model worker certificate for you!" Dilai laughed and said, "I've seen you like this many times before; you're just a grass fire, burning brightly but quickly extinguished!" Yian said, "This time, I'll definitely see it through to the end!" Dilai shook her head and said, "I've heard those words so many times too!" Yian said, "I'm finished! Even my own wife doesn't believe in me anymore!" With that, he put down the pen and sat down with his head lowered.

    Seeing him like this, Dilai felt a little sorry for him. She thought: I should still encourage him positively. She returned the bamboo hat to him and said softly, "It's not that I don't believe in you, it's just that I'm afraid you won't persevere and will become a laughingstock. As long as you are determined to change, then you can write it!" Yian picked up the pen again and said, "People won't be like this forever; can't I have a Great Leap Forward too?" Dilai was very happy to hear this, and she helped him hold the bamboo hat, allowing him to happily write the words "Soaring Enthusiasm."

    After arriving at the reservoir construction site, Yian worked very hard. Dilai heard about this and was very happy, thinking, "It's true, everyone is in the Great Leap Forward, can't a grass fire become a burning log fire!"

    A few days later, it was Sunday. Dilai ate dinner early and went to the village to organize people to visit the reservoir construction site tomorrow to offer encouragement. She was busy until midnight before returning home. When she got home, the door was wide open. She thought: There haven't been thieves since liberation, it couldn't be theft; could he have returned! She rushed into the room in a few steps, and sure enough, the kerosene lamp was flickering, and Yian was lying in bed snoring.

    Dilai shook Yian awake and asked, "Why did you come back?" Yian drowsily said, "I've been working for so many days, can't I come home to rest!" Dilai said somewhat displeased, "Looks like your old habit has returned! I say, you should go back to the construction site early tomorrow morning! We'll go visit you in the afternoon." Yian said sleepily, "I'm not going back." "You're really not going back?" "Don't argue, I want to sleep." With that, he turned over and began to snore again, and no matter how much she pushed him, she couldn't wake him up.

    Dilai stared at him resentfully for a long time, then suddenly turned around and saw Yian's bamboo hat hanging on the wall, the words "Soaring Enthusiasm" very conspicuous. This inscription aroused her anger even more: "Humph! What kind of soaring enthusiasm is this!" Unable to suppress the anger in her heart for a moment, she abruptly stood up, ran out the door, grabbed two handfuls of mud from the ditch, rushed back into the room, and smeared the words "Soaring Enthusiasm" on the bamboo hat.

    Yian had traveled half the night to get home last night and was very tired. He slept straight through until breakfast time. When he got up, he couldn't find Dilai and thought to go to the village to find her and show off his "Soaring Enthusiasm" hat to everyone. The bamboo hat was hanging upside down on the wall, and he was in a hurry to go out, so he didn't look at it carefully, and just took it off and put it on.

    He swaggered to the village street and ran into Meiying and her group of mischievous girls. When Meiying saw him, she asked in surprise, "What, you're back?" Yian smiled and said, "I'm back, it's Sunday." He intentionally turned around to let them see the words "Soaring Enthusiasm" on his bamboo hat. Who knew that when Meiying saw it, she burst out laughing, pointing at the bamboo hat and saying, "Brother Yian, your enthusiasm has really fallen from the sky to the ground, look, it's all covered in mud!" The girls also laughed and said, "You're wearing a 'Enthusiasm Landed' hat!" They chattered, mocking Yian until his face was red. He took off the bamboo hat and, seeing the mud smeared on it, angrily cursed, "Who is the busybody playing a joke on me!" Meiying said seriously, "People probably aren't joking with you, they're warning you. Think about it, we're organizing a comfort team to go to the construction site to comfort you, but you came back!" "I, I..." Yian suddenly stammered, unable to say a reason for a long time. One of the girls said, "Just say your grass fire burned out!" A mountain singer immediately composed a mountain song and began to sing: "Leap Forward wind blows fiercely, blows down mountains and blows up ash, others soar to the sky, you land on the ground, you dare to wear the hat!" Everyone sang together, singing until Yian wished there was a hole in the ground to crawl into. He didn't bother looking for Dilai and turned around and ran back.

    Back at home, he threw the bamboo hat hard on the ground and cursed, "I don't wear this thing, I don't think anyone will die!"

    After a while, he calmed down and thought: These past few days at the construction site, I've been wearing this hat every day, and everyone who saw it gave me admiring glances. Why am I being ridiculed today when I wear it? It's because I was doing a good job at the construction site, I deserved to wear it; today, I ran back from the construction site, and what I did doesn't deserve this hat. Wearing the "Soaring Enthusiasm" hat is an honor, and this honor can't be faked. If it's fake, the masses won't approve. It seems that today's shame can't be blamed on the hat, only on myself. I don't want to fall behind, how can I throw away the hat? So, he picked up the bamboo hat and used water to wash off the mud. As he was washing, Dilai came back and said, "Water won't wash it off." Yian looked up and asked angrily, "You were the one who smeared the mud, right? Good!" Dilai said calmly, "You were the one who smeared the mud on yourself first. I ask you, what did you say when you wanted to write on the bamboo hat?" Yian said, "Didn't I do a good job at the construction site?" Dilai said, "But why didn't you persevere and ran back?" Yian was speechless and lowered his head. Dilai said sadly, "Yian! Why are you always like this, starting strong but ending weak, making me..." She couldn't continue. Seeing her so sad, Yian couldn't help but feel ashamed and remorseful. He put down the wet bamboo hat, walked over, took Dilai's hand, and stammered, "Dilai, I...you..."

    After a while, Dilai picked up the bamboo hat, half of the mud washed away, and said, "Yian, the mud you smeared on yourself has to be washed away with actions. I think, you should go back to the construction site after breakfast; otherwise, it won't be good if the comfort team 'escorts' you back." Yian obediently said, "Okay!"

    Yian returned to the reservoir construction site and worked very well until the end of the project. When the workers returned, the people in the village went to welcome them. Dilai specially bought a new bamboo hat, wrote the words "Soaring Enthusiasm" on it, and personally put it on Yian's head. From then on, Yian wore this "Soaring Enthusiasm" hat everywhere he went, and no one laughed at him anymore, and the nickname "Grass Fire" was no longer used.

### “干劲冲天”帽

    “干劲冲天”帽
    朝阳
    我们这地方的僮族人民，喜欢戴一种细篾编织的雨帽。它比汉族的斗笠小，比草帽大，晴雨都适宜；又由于它编织得精致、好看，人们出门就把它背上。它是用具，也是装饰品。
    篾帽上写上“干劲冲天”四字，是县委书记的一句话引起的。县委书记在一次号召大跃进的会上说：“我们要以冲天的干劲来改变我们县的面貌！”听了这报告后，不知是谁，为了表示决心，就在这晴雨不离的篾帽上写上“干劲冲天”四字。接着，许多人也跟着在篾帽上写下这几个字。一时间，戴“干劲冲天”帽就成为了一种风气。
    这种帽也不是随便可以戴的。首先，戴的人真要有冲天的干劲。要是干劲差点，群众会不承认。所以，干劲不足的人是不好意思随便把这几个字往篾帽上写的。
    有个青年社员覃一安，外号“茅草火”，意思是燃起来轰轰烈烈，可是很快就燃完了，熄灭了。他做事也就是这个样子，开头很有劲，叫喊得比谁都响亮，可是不用多久，劲头就烟消火灭了。他自以为很积极，但选积极分子时群众总不选他。他的爱人韦弟来，是团小组长，为了他这个毛病，不知同他生过多少气。
    县里修万宝山水库，各社都派民工参加，覃一安第一个跑去报了名，心想：这次戴得成“干劲冲天”帽了。买了一顶新篾帽，拿回家去，把一支大笔蘸饱了墨水就要往上面写字。
    弟来正给他收拾衣服行李，忙走过来，伸手把篾帽拿开，说道：“你不能自己随便往上面写字。”一安瞪着眼道：“怎么，当积极分子还要请过封？”弟来道：“是要请封。要群众封，不要自己封。”一安道：“我第一个报名参加修水库，还不配戴‘干劲冲天’帽？”弟来道：“你第一个报名是好的，可是光报了名还不算数，要看你在工地上表现得怎样。”一安拍着胸脯道：“这你就不用担心罗。我保证拿回一个模范来给你看！”弟来笑道：“你这样子我见过好多次了，就是茅草火，燃得旺，熄得快！”一安道：“这一次我一定有始有终！”弟来摇头道：“这话我也听过好多次了！”一安道：“我这人算完了！连自己的老婆都信不过我了！”说罢，把笔一放，低着头就坐了下来。
    见他这副样子，弟来又有些怜惜他。心想：还是从积极方面鼓励他吧。就把篾帽还给他，柔声说道：“不是信不过你，是怕你不能坚持，惹人家笑话。只要你能决心改正，那你就写吧！”一安重新拿起笔来道：“人不会一辈子都这样，难道我就不会大跃进么？”这话说得弟来很喜欢，帮他扶着篾帽，让他高高兴兴的写上“干劲冲天”四字。
    到了水库工地，一安干得很起劲。弟来听到了，心里很高兴，想道：“当真嘛，人人都在大跃进，难道茅草火就不能变成榾柮火！”
    过了几天就是星期日，弟来早早的吃了晚饭，就到村里去组织人明天到水库工地慰问，忙到半夜才回家。到家一看，大门敞着。心想：解放以后就没有贼了，不会是被窃；莫不是他回来了！三脚两步赶进房，可不是，煤油灯半熄不熄，一安躺在床上正打鼾。
    弟来把一安推醒，问道：你“怎么回来了？”一安惺忪着睡眼道：“干了这么些天，还不让人回家休息休息！”弟来有些不高兴道：“看你的毛病又发了！我说，明天一早你还是赶回工地去吧！我们下午就去慰问你们。”一安带着睡意道：“我不回去。”“你真不回去？”“莫吵哩，人家要睡觉。”说罢，翻身向里，又打起鼾来，再推也推不醒了。
    弟来愤愤地望了他半晌，猛回头，望见一安的篾帽挂在壁上，
  “干劲冲天”四字十分显眼。这字样更引起了她的气：“哼！这算什么干劲冲天！”一时压不住心中的怒火，霍地站起来，跑出门去，在阳沟里抓了两把稀泥，赶进房，把篾帽上的“干劲冲天”四字，唏哩哗啦地涂掉。
    一安昨晚赶了半夜路才到家，很累，直睡到吃早饭时候才起床。起来不见弟来，心想到村里去找她，顺便在大家面前显显那顶“干劲冲天”帽。那篾帽是反挂在壁上的，他急着出去，也没有看看，顺手取下就背上了。
    他摇摇摆摆的走到村街上，迎面碰着美英那伙调皮的女孩子。美英见了他，吃惊地问道：“怎么，你回来了？”一安笑道：“回来了，过星期日嘛。”有意转转身，让她们看到他篾帽上的“干劲冲天”几个字。哪知美英一看，哈哈大笑起来，指着篾帽道：“一安哥，你的干劲当真是从天上掉到地下了，看，都涂上泥了！”那几个女孩子也边笑边说道：“你戴的原来是干劲落地帽呀！”七嘴八舌，嘲弄得一安满脸通红。他取下篾帽一看，见了上面涂的泥，气的骂道：“是那个多手的，开老子的玩笑！”美英正色道：“人家恐怕不是同你开玩笑，是在警戒你。想想吧，我们正组织慰问队到工地去慰问你们，可是你倒回来了！”“我，我……”一安忽然口吃起来，半天说不出一个理由。一个女孩子道：“干脆，你就说是茅草火燃过了吧！”有个山歌手立刻编了首山歌，唱将起来：“跃进风头猛猛吹，吹倒大山吹起灰，别人冲天你落地，亏你敢把帽子背！”大家一齐唱起来，唱得一安恨不得有个地缝钻下去，也顾不得找弟来，转身就跑回去了。
    回到家里，他把篾帽狠狠地往地上一扔，骂道：“不戴这个东西，我看会不会死人！”
    过了半晌，冷静些了，他想道：这几天在工地上，自己天天戴这顶帽子，谁见了，投过来的都是钦佩的眼光，为什么今天戴上就被嘲笑呢？这是因为自己在工地上干得不错，配戴；今天呢，自己从工地上跑回来了，做的事配不上这顶帽子了。戴“干劲冲天”帽是一种光荣，这光荣假不得，一假群众就不答应，看来，今天这场羞不能怪帽子，只能怪自己。自己并不愿落后，怎能把帽子扔掉呢？于是，他把篾帽拾起来，用水来洗上面的泥。正洗着，弟来回来了，说了声：“水洗不掉的。”一安抬起头来，含怒问道：“泥是你涂的吧？好呀！”弟来平静地道：“那是你先给你自己涂了泥。我问你，你要在篾帽上写字时是怎么说的？”一安道：“难道我在工地上干得不好？”弟来道：“可是你为什么不坚持下去，跑回来了？”一安没话讲，低下头来。弟来沉痛地道：“一安啊！你为什么老是这样虎头蛇尾，叫我……”她说不下去了，见她那么伤心的样子，一安不禁又愧又悔。他把湿淋淋的篾帽放下，走过来握着弟来的手，嗫嚅地道：“弟来，我……你……。”
    半晌，弟来拿起那被水洗去了一半泥的篾帽道：“一安，自己涂上的泥，得用行动来洗。我看，你吃了早饭就回工地去吧；不然，等慰问队把你‘欢送’回去就不好了”一安顺从地道：“好嘛！”
    一安回到水库工地，一直到工程结束，都工作得很好。民工队回来时候，村里的人去欢迎。弟来特地买了顶新篾帽，写上“干劲冲天”四字，亲自给一安戴上。以后，一安戴着这顶“干劲冲天”帽到处走动，再也没有人嘲笑，“茅草火”的外号也没有人叫了。（附图片）〔苗地  插图〕
