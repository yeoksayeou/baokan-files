    Those Who Can, Take the Stage to Lecture; Workers Pick Up Pens to Write Books
    Shanghai Huafu Gear Factory Relies on the Masses to Solve Teacher and Textbook Problems

    (Our report) In the high tide of Shanghai's large-scale development of spare-time education, the Shanghai Huafu Gear Factory, with only a little over one hundred employees and not a single engineer or technician, established a gear secondary technical school. Relying on mobilizing the worker masses to write their own books and give their own lectures, they solved the problems of teachers and textbooks and ran the school very well.

    Although Huafu Factory is small and has few people, it has great ambitions. This factory can only produce gears for one thousand machine tools this year, but next year it will produce gears for more than forty thousand machine tools. Not only has the quantity of products increased, but the technical requirements have also increased, requiring the mass production of advanced and precision gears that have never been made before. To achieve this arduous task, the biggest difficulty is the lack of technical strength. Therefore, both old and new workers are eager to improve their cultural and scientific and technological levels. After the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call for factories to run schools, the workers of this factory relied on their own efforts, started from scratch, and happily established their own spare-time gear secondary technical school. Factory Director Wang Xingye, who has been a worker for three generations and never even attended school, is now both a student of this gear technical school and the principal, and also serves as a political teacher along with the Party branch secretary. Fourteen experienced old workers are responsible for teaching technical courses, while apprentices, inspectors, and office staff are responsible for teaching cultural courses. The teacher problem was thus solved.

    The school was established, and teachers were found, but the textbooks became a major problem. In particular, it was difficult to explain technical courses without textbooks. The students generally had a low level of education, and could listen but not remember. As time went on, they gradually forgot. The factory leadership discovered this problem and decided to mobilize the masses to write textbooks based on their own production experience. To break down the concerns and superstitions about writing textbooks, all the factory workers and cadres launched a heated study and discussion on issues such as "where does book knowledge come from" and "can workers write books?" Once the superstitious and self-deprecating ideas were broken, the discussion meeting immediately turned into a heroes' meeting for self-reporting and mutual reporting on writing books. The list of books was compiled, and the principles of writing books were also discussed: advanced examples that promote socialism should be written, basic technical operations should be written, and any personal experiences and useful theories from reference books should also be written. Master Shen Quansheng is a skilled fitter and turner. He couldn't write himself, so he dictated, and apprentice Zhang Guanfa, who had a junior high school education, helped him record. Master Xiang Shouhui has drilling experience and can also write, but not fluently enough, so the office staff helped him process the text. Master Gao Baolin is responsible for compiling the lathe textbook. He draws very well, so he draws more pictures to make up for the lack of written expression. In this way, after a week of hard work, thirty-seven sets of technical course materials were compiled. These textbooks are very rich in content, with both practical and theoretical aspects, pictures, and exercises. The master craftsmen explain and demonstrate at the same time during class, and the students respond very well.

    Old workers are not only good at teaching technical courses, but also good at combining ideological education with technical courses. The first lesson they teach is about how they were beaten and scolded and suffered hardships when they worked in the old society. When new workers learn a little technique, they talk about the comparison between the old and new societies, encouraging young workers to study hard in today's good learning conditions in order to accelerate the construction of socialism. The words of the old workers deeply moved the young people. Some young men who used to think about going out to play after work can now consciously persist in studying.

    能者登台讲课  工人挥笔写书
    上海华富齿轮厂依靠群众解决师资、教材问题
    本报讯  只有一百多职工，没有一个工程师、技术员的上海华富齿轮厂，在上海大办业余教育的高潮中，办起了一所齿轮中等专科学校，依靠发动工人群众自己编书自己讲课，解决了师资和教材问题，把学校办得很好。
    华富厂虽然厂小人少，却有很大的志气。这个厂今年只能生产一千台机床所需的齿轮，明年就要生产四万多台机床所需的齿轮。不仅产品的数量增加了，而且技术要求也提高了，要大量生产过去从未做过的高级、精密的齿轮。要实现这个艰巨的任务，最大的困难是技术力量不足，因此新老工人都迫切要求提高自己的文化和科学技术水平。在中共上海市委发出厂厂办学的号召以后，这个工厂的职工们便自力更生、白手起家，欢天喜地地把自己的业余齿轮中等专科学校办了起来。一家三代做工，连学校都没有上过的厂长王兴业，现在既是这个齿轮专科学校的学生，又担任了校长，还和党支部书记一道担任了政治课教师。十四个有着丰富经验的老工人负责上技术课，艺徒、检验员、科室人员等负责上文化课，教师问题就这样解决了。
    学校办起来了，教师也找到了，教材可成了大问题，特别是技术课没有教材讲不清楚，学员一般文化程度都比较低，能听不能记，日子一久渐渐忘了。工厂领导发现了这个问题，决定发动群众根据自己的生产经验自己来编写教材。为了打破编写教材的顾虑和迷信，全厂工人、干部就“书本知识从哪里来”，“工人能不能著书立说”等问题开展了一场热烈的学习和讨论。迷信自卑思想一打破，讨论会马上变成了自报互报写书的群英会。书目有了，编书的原则也讨论了出来：对社会主义起促进作用的先进事例要写，基本的技术操作要写，点滴的个人经验、参考书本上有用的理论也要写。沈泉生老师傅是钳床能手，自己不会写，就用口述，学徒工张关发有初中文化水平，就帮他记。项守辉老师傅有钻床经验，也能写，但不够通顺，科室人员就帮他在文字上加工。高保林老师傅负责编车工教材，他画图画得很好，就多画些图来弥补文字表达的不足。这样经过一周的苦战，就编出了三十七套技术课教材。这些教材内容都很丰富，既有实际，又有理论，有图画，还有习题。老师傅上课时一面讲解，一面表演，学员们反映十分好。
    老工人不仅会讲技术课，还善于在技术课中结合思想教育。他们上的第一课，就是讲自己在旧社会做工如何挨打受骂，吃尽苦头；待新工人学到一点技术，他们又讲新旧社会的对比，鼓励青年工人在今天这个好的学习条件下，为加速建设社会主义努力学习。老工人的话使青年人深受感动，有些小伙子原来下班就想到外面玩，现在也能自觉地坚持学习了。
