    Mass Movement Deepens, Technological Revolution Measures Implemented
    First Automobile Factory Comprehensively Arranges Production and Promotes "Eight Fixes"
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 4th dispatch) The mass movement at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is continuing to deepen.
    Following the completion of the factory design and product design for the 250-vehicle per shift "Liberation" brand truck, the factory leadership promptly adjusted the plant's production tasks, balanced the overall progress, formulated a number of major technological reform measures, and implemented the "Eight Fixes" (i.e., fix product design, fix process route, fix equipment, fix tooling, fix production area, fix personnel, fix trial production, fix schedule) in each production group to ensure that the various technological reform measures are implemented.
    Currently, the factory is deeply mobilizing the masses to solve the design and equipment problems for batch production of "East Wind" and "Red Flag" sedans. One of the key issues for batch production of "East Wind" and "Red Flag" is the urgent manufacturing of stamping dies. The stamping die fixture workshop recently received an order to design more than 100 sets of stamping dies for 58 parts for the "East Wind." According to the workshop's design team's capacity at the time, it would take until the end of December to complete. This would postpone the deadline for the factory's planned completion of the entire set of "East Wind" stamping dies next year, inevitably affecting the batch production of the "East Wind". In response to this situation, the workshop's Party branch decided to immediately launch a mass movement, mobilizing workers to draw and design stamping dies. Responding to the call of the Party committee, workers, cadres, and technicians fully utilized the "three-way combination" role. More than 90 workers and a dozen technicians completed the design, which originally technical personnel would take two months to complete, in one day and one night. Based on their own designs, the workers are now urgently manufacturing this batch of stamping dies, which is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The stamping workshop fully mobilized the masses, enabling more than half of the apprentices in the workshop to also participate in the design work. Under the guidance of veteran workers, they have designed 50 sets of stamping dies. The thousand sets of tooling for "East Wind" and "Red Flag" are expected to be completed by February next year.
    According to the requirements of the new factory design plan, the plant needs to add more than a thousand pieces of equipment. More than a thousand employee representatives from various workshops, led by the factory director, recently visited and studied the experience of the Harbin Machine United Factory in building machine tools on a large scale. Through employee representative meetings and other forms, they carried out extensive debates, deeply criticized the ideas of "reaching out" and undervaluing indigenous machine tools and simple special-purpose equipment, further establishing the idea of substituting simplicity for complexity, special-purpose for universal, and indigenous for foreign, once again launching a major equipment revolution. To date, more than 160 pieces of various mechanical equipment have been manufactured, and the plant is working towards producing 800 units by the end of the month. The "Satellite" group, the chassis workshop steering gear housing group, which first advocated workers' participation in design, assembled the machine tools they needed in a few days using some waste parts. A domestic copy milling machine being manufactured in the stamping die fixture workshop can replace a similar imported machine tool worth more than one million yuan.
    Some workshops have also formed production lines for specialized products using their own manufactured machine tools. The Second Foundry Workshop, which is responsible for casting patterns, had insufficient production capacity and became the factory's "bottleneck". The workshop's employees proposed to break the "bottleneck" and liberate the factory's productivity, doubling the output of castings and patterns this month.
    In order to ensure the implementation of technological revolution measures, all employees of the factory generally requested to master scientific and technological knowledge. Currently, various workshops in the factory are preparing to establish various specialized Red and Expert colleges and specialized departments to carry out cultural and technological revolution movements.

    群众运动步步深入  技术革命措施落地
    第一汽车厂全面安排生产推行“八定”
    本报长春4日电  第一汽车制造厂的群众运动正在继续深入开展。
    继完成了班产二百五十辆解放牌汽车的工厂设计和产品设计之后，汽车厂的领导及时调整了全厂生产任务，平衡了全厂进度，制定了一些重大的技术改革措施，并在各个生产小组中推行八定（即定产品设计、定工艺路线、定设备、定工艺装备、定生产面积、定人员、定试制、定进度），以保证技术改革的各项措施落地。
    目前，这个厂正在深入发动群众解决成批生产“东风”“红旗”小轿车的设计和工厂的设备问题。成批生产“东风”和“红旗”的关键问题之一，是赶制冲模。冲模夹具车间不久以前接到要为“东风”设计五十八个零件的一百多套冲模。按当时车间设计组的力量，要到12月底才能完成。这将使全厂明年预定完成“东风”全套冲模的生产任务的期限向后推迟。“东风”的成批生产必将受到影响。针对这种情况，车间党总支决定立即大搞群众运动，发动工人动手画图、设计冲模。响应党委的号召，工人、干部、技术人员充分发挥了“三结合”的作用。九十多名工人和十多名技术员，在一天一夜，就完成了原计划技术人员要两个月才能完成的设计。工人们根据自己设计的图纸，现在正赶制这批冲模，预计月底完成。冲压车间充分的发动群众，使占车间一半以上的徒工，也投入设计工作。他们在老工人的帮助下，已设计冲模五十套，“东风”、“红旗”的上千套工艺装备，预计在明年2月可全部制成。
    根据新的工厂设计方案的要求，全厂需要增加上千台设备。各车间一千多名职工代表，在厂长率领下，最近到哈尔滨机联厂参观和学习了大造机床的经验后，通过职工代表会等形式，开展了大辩论，深入地批判了“伸手派”，轻视土机床和简易专用设备的思想，进一步树立了以简代繁、以专用代万能、以土代洋的思想，再一次掀起设备大革命。到最近已制成各种机械设备一百六十多台，全厂正向月底生产八百台而努力。首倡工人参加设计的“卫星”小组——底盘车间转向器壳小组，在几天内，就用一些废零件装配了自己所需要的机床。冲模夹具车间正在制造的一台土靠模铣床，可以代替一台价值一百多万元的同样的进口机床。
    有的车间，用自己生产的机床，还组成了专门产品的生产线。担负铸造模型任务的第二铸工车间生产能力不足，成了全厂的“瓶子口”。这个车间的职工提出要打碎“瓶子口”，解放全厂生产力，在这个月里，把铸造和模型的产量翻一番。
    为了保证技术革命措施的实现，全厂职工普遍要求掌握科学技术知识，现在这个厂各个车间正在筹建各种专业的红专学院和专业系，开展文化技术革命运动。
