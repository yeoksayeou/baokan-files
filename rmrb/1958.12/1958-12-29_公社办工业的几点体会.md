Some Experiences in Running Industry by Communes
中共山东高唐县委员会

Gaotang County's industrial foundation was very weak in the past. In the dozen or so years since liberation, only two cotton processing factories, one iron factory, eight iron repair shops, and one wood industry cooperative were built. Due to simple equipment and poor technical conditions, the production capacity was very low. The iron shops could only manufacture small farm tools and repair larger production tools.

However, this situation has undergone fundamental changes this year. Due to the impact of the great leap forward in agriculture, our county has experienced two industrial construction upsurges. The rapid development of industry, in turn, has promoted a greater leap forward in agricultural production, ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest. Currently, the county has 280 factories with 13,407 workers, accounting for 8.9% of the total labor force. The total industrial output value for the year is expected to reach 130 million yuan, accounting for 61.9% of the total agricultural output value, an increase of 31 times compared to the 1957 industrial output value.

In the process of vigorously developing industry over the past year, we have always adhered to the principle of starting from actual needs and realistic possibilities, that is, what raw materials are available, what industries are developed, and what is needed, what is produced. We mainly established four types of industries: (1) serving agricultural production; (2) serving the lives of commune members; (3) processing agricultural products (or supporting large-scale industry or for export); and (4) building materials.

The development of industrial production has already demonstrated a great role in production, life, and socialist construction. First, it promoted technological innovation, created many production tools, promoted agriculture, and equipped industry. According to statistics, a total of 584,124 pieces of water lifting tools, various farm tools, and transportation tools have been produced in the past year, and 240 new products have been created and modified, and "three transformations" have been realized, namely, bearingization of rotating tools, vehicularization of transportation, and mechanization of rope traction. At the same time, it has greatly liberated women, saving 2,829,000 labor days; reducing labor intensity, improving labor conditions, and making eight kinds of labor such as crushing, sewing, grain processing, transportation, and cotton ginning change from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization. Through the exercise of production movement, the industry itself has also grown rapidly from small to large and from indigenous to foreign. Some large factories in the county and communes, such as machinery factories, oil pressing factories, grain processing factories, clothing and shoe factories, etc., have reached mechanization. A large number of equipment has been added to the factories. The county has manufactured 235 hand-operated ball pressing machines, 177 indigenous lathes, and 96 simple machine tools.

Second, the development of industry has made the best use of materials, increased social wealth, and improved the lives of commune members. For example, the nine paper mills we have set up produce 6,000 tons of paper annually, worth about 7.2 million yuan. The raw material for papermaking is cotton stalks, but in the past, cotton stalks were burned in the stove. The six cotton peel degumming and rope making factories can produce 8,000 tons of various hemp products (mainly ropes and sacks) annually, worth about 4.8 million yuan.

Third, through the industrial development in the past year, we have laid the foundation for industry, trained many technical personnel, especially through the all-rounder movement, and cultivated a large part of versatile technical workers. At the same time, we have initially accumulated some industrial management experience, laying a favorable foundation for further vigorous development of industry.

The achievements of Gaotang County in vigorously developing industry are the result of the correct leadership of the Party, the direct care and training of the Central Committee, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Prefectural Party Committee, and the implementation of the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy.

In our specific work, we have the following experiences:

    Putting Politics in Command, Ideology First

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao taught us: Political and ideological work is always the soul and commander of all work. Our two industrial upsurges to establish 280 factories are the result of implementing this instruction. Over the past year, the process of vigorously developing industry has made us deeply realize that the struggle between two ideologies and two lines runs through the entire industrial upsurge.

Some people hold a skeptical attitude towards the idea that rural areas should run industry and can vigorously develop industry. These ideas are concentrated in the following aspects: ① They fail to see the necessity of vigorously developing industry in the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, and believe that people's communes should not vigorously develop industry, saying that "peasants should focus on agriculture"; ② Some people believe that engaging in industry contradicts engaging in agriculture, saying that running industry will affect the development of agriculture; ③ A few people are satisfied with the past industrial achievements and fail to see the new topics that the new situation has put forward for commune industry, so they simply emphasize consolidation and ignore development. However, some people also have one-sided and wrong understandings of what kind of industry to run and how to run it. Some people believe that the commune has abundant materials and financial resources, and needs to build extravagantly, show off wealth, and pursue "large and foreign", and some people are afraid that if too many factories are built, there will be no raw materials to obtain. In order to clarify the above-mentioned various confused ideas and wrong views, the county party committee resolutely implemented the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees, first analyzed the new tasks brought about by the new situation, and realized that developing agriculture must develop industry, developing industry is the urgent requirement of the broad masses, and is urgently needed for the development of people's communes. Only engaging in agriculture and not engaging in industry cannot be regarded as a complete people's commune. This made us realize that the Central Committee's proposal to simultaneously promote industry and agriculture is very timely and correct.

On the basis of the county party committee unifying thinking and reaching consensus, in order to unify the thinking of the entire party and the entire people, we adopted a combination of top-down propaganda and mobilization (that is, talking about the situation and talking about the prospects) and bottom-up airing of views and debates (that is, detailed accounting and brainstorming), and used large meetings, small meetings, field breaks, construction sites, workshops, before and after meals and other occasions to carry out debates. The county posted a total of 180,000 big-character posters, fiercely attacking conservative ideas and removing obstacles. In addition, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and ensure the victory of the industrial construction upsurge, we also adopted the methods of learning, calculating, and comparing to educate the masses.

Learn, that is, to learn the general line and the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, arm the mind, and strengthen the red and expert forces. The eight communes have repeatedly held party committee, cadre, worker, and commune member meetings, and combined with rectification to universally study the general line and the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, and organized a propaganda army of 10,000 people to use various forms to go deep into construction sites, workshops, and families to conduct extensive propaganda, creating a large-scale propaganda and learning movement throughout the county, with more than 300,000 people receiving education. A team of activists in socialist construction who are both red and expert has also been cultivated and strengthened, with a total of more than 21,000 people.

Calculate, that is, to calculate the benefits thoroughly and recognize the great significance of industry serving agriculture. We calculated that using manual methods to grind flour, make shoes, and sew clothes would require more than 20,000 people and more than 2,400 livestock in the county. After vigorously developing industry, if the stone mill is powered, the shoe making machine is used to make shoes, and the sewing machine is used to make clothes, only 3,900 people are needed, which can save more than 16,000 laborers and more than 2,400 livestock to invest in agricultural production movement than manual labor.

Compare, that is, to constantly summarize the role of running industry and conduct before-and-after comparisons. For example, in the past, transporting manure was done by people carrying it, but after vigorously developing industry, bearingization and vehicularization were realized, which reduced labor intensity and ensured the completion of the fertilizer delivery task, which was dozens to hundreds of times more than in the past.

    Focus on Small Scale, Combine Small and Medium Scale
    Focus on Indigenous Methods, Combine Indigenous and Foreign Methods

In the upsurge of vigorously developing industry, the issue of large and small, indigenous and foreign is also one of the focuses of the struggle. A part of people blindly believed in foreign methods, purely pursued formalism, did not proceed from reality, wanted big and good, and put forward the so-called "three no's" argument, that is, no machinery, no beautiful factory buildings, and no engineers and experts. However, some people simply emphasized that the smaller the better, buried in the "indigenous" and did not see the new technologies that could be adopted. These are two kinds of extreme prejudices, which centrally demonstrate the wrong tendency of not proceeding from actual needs and possibilities. The county party committee strictly criticized these two kinds of wrong ideas, resolutely implemented the Central Committee's proposed "small, indigenous, and mass" policy, and under the premise of self-reliance, focused on small scale, combined small and medium scale; focused on indigenous methods, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and the spirit of indigenous methods first, indigenous methods first and then foreign methods, and established 280 factories. These factories have foreign ones, and there are also indigenous and foreign combined ones, and there are also indigenous ones (most of them are indigenous). For example, in the eight paper mills, except for the paper copying process which is driven by power, the remaining processes, such as pulping and crushing, are operated manually by indigenous methods, so that indigenous and foreign methods are combined. The paper machine is made of wood. The machine tools and gantry planers of the machinery factory are all made by indigenous methods. A large number of agricultural machinery (including sweet potato slicers with a daily output of 200,000 kilograms) are largely made of wood. The factory buildings are also built by indigenous methods first. Among the 4,700 newly added factory buildings in the county, more than 80% are utilizing old houses.

    Vigorously Develop Mass Movement and Technical Revolution

Whether or not to vigorously develop mass movement and whether or not to rely on the masses to carry out technical revolution in vigorously developing industry is also a struggle of two ideologies on the industrial front. Over the past year, the county party committee has adhered to the practice of relying on the masses to run industry and mobilizing the masses to vigorously engage in technical revolution, and criticized the idea that mass movement cannot be carried out in running industry, and that peasants are "illiterate" who do not know technology and cannot participate in technical revolution. Therefore, industrial construction has achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results, and technical revolution is thriving.

In our work, we proceeded as follows:

① In order to solve the problems of equipment, materials, and transportation in industrial construction, we listed a list and handed it over to the masses to solve it themselves. At that time, the slogan put forward by the masses was: "If you need people, you have people, if you need things, you donate things, and you fully support industrial construction", "Do your own thing, build your own factory". For example, the Luwei Commune wanted to build a factory building. The masses concentrated 270 large beams and 1,600 purlins overnight. Then, an 180,000 brick movement was launched, and as a result, 210,000 pieces were sent to the factory day and night. They also relied on the masses to fight hard for five days and nights and built 107 factory buildings on the ground.

② In order to solve the problem of technical strength, we adopted the measures of giving full play to the wisdom of the masses and using indigenous methods to drive foreign methods, and put forward the slogan of everyone contributing ideas and suggestions, and everyone creating inventions, and launched a mass movement to eliminate superstitions, emancipate the mind, and vigorously engage in technical revolution throughout the county. Through this movement, great results have been achieved. The county machinery factory created gantry planers and plate hammers, successfully trial-produced gas engines and diesel engines, and produced a large number of simple lathes. These new products were created by the workers using the method of "ants gnawing bones". In the eight communes, the workers also used the simplest tools to create indigenous lathes, spring hammers, blowers and other production tools, and new types of agricultural tools such as deep plows, close planting drills, and rope traction machines. In the 45-day upsurge of vigorously developing industry, they actually created some production tools that they had never seen before, such as oil presses, paper machines, textile machines, drying cylinders, etc. Therefore, the cadres concluded that: "Relying on the masses is infinitely powerful, and it is difficult to move an inch away from the masses." Facts have proved that the masses are not all-rounders, but omnipotent.

③ In solving technical problems, in addition to adopting the methods of recommending talents, taking apprentices, and sending them out to study to train more than 1,900 people, each factory established a technical research committee or group to regularly study and exchange technical experience. At a mass meeting in Dongfeng Commune, the masses recommended more than 700 technical workers; in Luwei Commune, there was an 18-year-old girl named Wang Xiuqin, who led 45 young workers to learn bricklaying and house building from old bricklayers in the five-day factory construction, and became 45 bricklayers. In addition, the method of visiting exhibitions was also used to promote technical experience. We held a total of 23 visits, and each commune set up exhibition halls, which effectively spread technology and strengthened technical strength.

          Organize Joint Factories

The organizational form of joint factories can meet the needs of the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, and can meet the characteristics of the people's communes being large and public. Therefore, we universally promoted and adopted this form.

In the first upsurge of vigorously developing industry, the more than 13,000 small and scattered factories, stations, and groups that were started were merged into 137 joint factories. After the people's commune, we also universally adopted the form of joint factories to organize the newly built and expanded 181 factories on the basis of the original township and commune joint factories, setting up two factories and one station, namely the commune joint factory, the farming area joint factory, and the production team joint processing station. The main task of the commune factory is to manufacture and repair relatively large production tools; the main task of the farming area joint factory is to repair and manufacture some small farm tools; the production team processing station is responsible for the repair and installation of various small tools. In this way, an industrial network is formed in the commune to meet the needs of production and life.

      Industry and Agriculture Simultaneously Promote

The mass movement of vigorously developing industry in our county over the past year has been able to develop rapidly and form such a scale today. The main key lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party, the first secretary personally taking charge, and adhering to the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture from the county party committee to the communes. For the leadership work of industry, the county and commune party committees have set up a secretary specifically responsible, and 192 cadres have been transferred to concentrate on grasping industry. The county and commune have set up industrial offices, and each commune has organized an industrial construction headquarters to organize professional troops to be responsible to the end.

In the movement, party organizations at all levels focused on industry and agriculture, and comprehensively arranged various tasks. The first secretary grasped industry with one hand and agriculture with the other. Some went to the fields during the day and to the factory at night. The secretary in charge of industry ate, lived, and worked with the workers. The work focused on four key points: grasping political and ideological work to unify the ideological understanding of the entire party and the entire people; grasping the organization of mass movement; grasping technology and grasping production to achieve the planning, construction, production, and management. In addition, by grasping both ends to bring the middle, inserting red flags and pulling out white flags, competitions and visits promote the movement.

The above is some of the main situations of vigorously developing industry in our county over the past year. Because running industry in rural areas, especially running industry in communes, is a new issue, and we have not deeply understood the instructions of the superiors, there are still some problems in our work. That is, the leadership's thinking is still lagging behind the needs of production and the demands of the masses; secondly, the movement came fiercely and developed quickly, and individual factories neglected the quality, or the factories were built but could not quickly carry out normal production, which should be particularly noted and resolved in the future.

    公社办工业的几点体会
    中共山东高唐县委员会
    高唐县过去的工业基础很薄弱。解放后十几年来只兴建了两个棉花加工厂，一个铁工厂，八个铁业修配社和一个木业社。由于设备简陋，技术条件差，因此生产能力很低，铁业社只能制造些小型农具和修配比较大型的生产工具。
    但是，这种情况在今年发生了根本的变化。由于农业大跃进的影响，我县出现了两次工业建设高潮；工业的迅速发展，反转过来又促进了农业生产的更大跃进，保证了全面大丰收。目前全县有工厂二百八十处，工人一万三千四百零七名，占总劳力的8.9％，预计全年工业总产值将达到一亿三千万元，占农业总产值的61.9％，比1957年工业产值增加三十一倍。
    在一年来大办工业的过程中，我们始终坚持了从实际需要出发，从现实可能出发的原则，即有什么原料办什么工业和需要什么办什么。我们主要兴办了四类工业：（一）为农业生产服务的；（二）为社员生活服务的；（三）农产品加工的（或支援大工业或供出口）；（四）建筑材料。
    工业生产的发展已经在生产生活和社会主义建设等方面，显示了极大作用。首先推动了技术革新，创制了许多生产工具，促进了农业，装备了工业。据统计，一年来共生产了提水工具、各种农具、运输工具等达五十八万四千一百二十四件，创制改制的新产品就有二百四十种，并实现了“三化”，即运转工具轴承化，运输车子化，绳索牵引机化。同时还大大解放了妇女，节约劳力达二百八十二万九千名；减轻了劳动强度，改善了劳动条件，使碎粉、缝纫、粮食加工、运输、轧花等八种劳动都由手工操作变为半机械化和机械化。通过生产运动的锻炼，工业本身也由小到大、由土到洋的迅速的壮大起来。县和社的一些大厂，例如机械厂、榨油厂、粮食加工厂、被服制鞋厂等已经达到机械化。工厂里大量的增添了设备，全县共制造手搬压球机二百三十五台，土旋床一百七十七台，简易机床九十六台。
    其次，发展工业作到物尽其用，增加社会财富，改善社员生活。如我们办起的九处造纸厂年产纸六千吨，约值七百二十万元；造纸的原料是棉秆，但是棉秆在过去都烧了锅。六个棉皮脱胶和打绳工厂年可产各种麻制品（主要是绳和麻袋）八千吨，约值四百八十万元。
    其三，通过一年来的工业发展，铺下了工业的底子，培养了许多技术人员，特别是通过多面手运动，培养了很大一部分多艺的技术工人。同时我们还初步积累了一些工业的管理经验，为进一步大办工业打下了有利的基础。
    高唐县大办工业的成绩，是党的正确领导的结果，是中央、省委和地委直接关怀培养的结果，也是贯彻执行“小土群”方针的结果。
    在具体工作中我们有以下几点体会：
        政治挂帅思想先行
    党中央和毛主席教导我们说：政治思想工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。我们两次工业高潮办了二百八十处工厂就是执行这个指示的结果。一年来，大办工业的过程使我们深深体会到两种思想两条路线的斗争贯串在整个工业高潮中。
    有些人对农村应当办工业，而且能够大办工业的道理抱怀疑的态度，这些思想集中的表现在以下几个方面：①看不到在农业生产大跃进的新形势下大办工业的必要性，认为人民公社不应该大办工业，说什么“农民就得以农业为主”；②有的人认为搞工业与搞农业有矛盾，说办工业要影响农业的发展；③也有少数人满足于过去的工业成绩，看不到新形势给公社工业提出的新题目，因此单纯的强调巩固而忽视发展。但是也有人对办什么样的工业，怎样办工业有片面和错误的领会，有的认为公社里物资雄厚财力大，需要大兴土木，摆摆阔气，追求“大和洋”，也有的怕工厂办多了原料没处搞等。为了澄清上述形形色色的混乱思想和错误观点，县委坚决执行了中央和省地委的指示，首先分析了新形势带来的新任务，认识到发展农业就必须发展工业，发展工业是广大群众的迫切要求，是人民公社发展所急需。只搞农业不搞工业，不能算作一个完整的人民公社。这使我们体会到中央提出的工农业同时并举的方针是非常适时的、正确的。
    在县委统一思想、认识一致的基础上，为了统一全党全民的思想，我们采取了自上而下的宣传发动（即讲形势、话前景）和自下而上的鸣放辩论（即算细账出主意）相结合的方法，利用大会、小会、田间休息、工地、车间、饭前饭后等场合开展争辩。全县共张贴大字报十八万张，猛攻保守思想，扫除障碍。此外，为了调动群众的积极性，保证工业建设高潮的胜利，我们还采取了学、算、比的方法教育群众。
    学，就是学习总路线和工农业同时并举的方针，武装头脑，壮大红专力量。八个公社曾多次召开党委、干部、工人、社员会议，结合整风普遍学习了总路线和工农业同时并举的方针，并组织万人的宣传大军，利用各种形式深入工地、车间、家庭广泛宣传，在全县范围内造成了一个声势浩大的宣传学习运动，受教育的群众达三十余万人。又培养壮大了一批又红又专的社会主义建设积极分子队伍，共有两万一千多人。
    算，是算透好处账，认识工业为农业服务的重大意义。我们计算用人工磨面、作鞋、缝纫，全县需二万多人和二千四百多头牲口，大办工业之后，如果实现石磨动力化，用纳底机做鞋，用缝纫机做衣服，只需要三千九百人，比人工做可节省出一万六千多名劳力和二千四百多头牲口投入农业生产运动。
    比，就是经常不断的总结办工业的作用，进行前后对比。例如过去送粪是人抬人担，大办工业后，实现了轴承化、车子化，减轻了劳动强度，保证完成了比过去增加几十倍到几百倍的送肥任务。
    以小型为主，中小结合
      以土办法为主，土洋结合
    在大办工业的高潮中，大和小、土和洋的问题也是斗争的焦点之一。有一部分人迷信洋法，单纯的追求形式，不从现实出发，要大要好，提出了所谓“三不办”的论点，即没有机械不办，没有漂亮的厂房不办，没有工程师和专家不办。但是也有一部分人则单纯的强调愈小愈好，埋在“土”里而看不到可以采取的新技术。这是两种极端偏见，集中表现了不从实际需要与可能出发的错误倾向。县委严格的批判了这两种错误思想，坚决的贯彻了中央提出的“小土群”的方针，在自力更生的前提下以小型为主，中小结合；以土法为主，土洋结合，土法先上马，先土后洋的精神，办起了二百八十处工厂。这些工厂有洋的，也有土洋结合的，还有土的（大部分是土的）。例如八个造纸厂除抄纸工序采取动力带动外，其余工序，如打浆、碎粉等都采取土办法用手工操作，使土法和洋法结合起来。造纸机是木质的。机械厂的机床、龙门刨床都是土造的，大量的农业机械（包括日产二十万斤的地瓜切片机在内）很大一部分是木材做的。厂房也是土法先上马，全县新增加的四千七百间厂房，其中80％以上的都是利用的旧房。
    大搞群众运动大搞技术革命
    大办工业需要不需要大搞群众运动，依靠群众能不能进行技术革命，也是工业战线上两种思想的斗争。一年来，县委坚持了依靠群众办工业，发动群众大闹技术革命的作法，批判了那种认为办工业不能搞群众运动，农民是“大老粗”不会技术，不能参与技术革命的思想。因此使工业建设达到多快好省，使技术革命欣欣向荣。
    在工作中我们是这样进行的：
    ①为了解决工业建设中的设备、材料、运输等问题，我们就列张单子交给群众，让群众自己解决。当时群众提出的口号是：“要人有人，要物献物，全力支援工业建设”、“自己的事自己办，自己的工厂自己建”。例如鲁伟公社要修建厂房，群众一夜就集中了大梁二百七十架，檩条一千六百根，紧接着又掀起了十八万砖运动，结果一昼夜送进工厂二十一万块。他们还依靠群众苦战五昼夜，平地建厂房一百零七间。
    ②为了解决技术力量问题，采取充分发挥群众的智慧，以土带洋的措施，提出人人献计献策，个个创造发明的口号，在全县范围内掀起一个破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革命的群众运动。通过这个运动收到了很大的效果，县机械厂创造了龙门刨床、夹板锤，试制成功了煤气机、柴油机，生产了大量的简易车床，这些新的产品都是工人们利用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法创造出来的。在八个公社里，工人们还用最简陋的工具创造了土旋床、弹簧锤、鼓风机等生产工具，深耕犁、密植耧、绳索牵引机等新式农具。在四十五天大办工业的高潮中，居然创造了一些他们从来没有见过的生产工具，如油榨、造纸机、纺织机、烘缸等。因此，干部得出结论说：“依靠群众力量无穷，离开群众寸步难行”。事实证明群众不是多面手，而是万能手。
    ③在解决技术问题上，除采取推荐人材，带徒弟，派出去学习的办法培养了一千九百余名以外，各个工厂里都建立了技术研究委员会或小组，定期研究交流技术经验。东风社一次群众会，群众推荐技术工人七百余名；鲁伟社有一位十八岁的姑娘叫王秀琴，她领导着四十五名青年工人在五天建厂中跟老瓦工学会了砌砖盖房，成为四十五名瓦工。此外，还利用参观展览的方法推广技术经验，我们共召开了二十三次参观会，各公社都办起了展览馆，有力的传播了技术，壮大了技术力量。
          举办联合工厂
    联合工厂的组织形式能够适应农业生产大跃进新形势的需要，能够适应人民公社又大又公的特点，因此，我们普遍的推广采用了这种形式。
    第一次大办工业的高潮中把开始建起的一万三千多个小而分散的厂、站、组合并为一百三十七处联合工厂。人民公社化以后，我们又在原来乡、社联合工厂的基础上，把新建扩建的一百八十一个厂子普遍采用联合工厂的形式组织起来，设两厂一站，即公社联合工厂、耕作区联合工厂和生产队联合加工站。公社工厂主要任务是制造、修配比较大型的生产工具；耕作区联合工厂主要任务是修配并制造些小型农具；生产队加工站主要担负各种小型工具的修配安装。这样在公社里就形成了一个工业网，适应生产和生活的需要。
      工业和农业同时并举
    我县一年来大办工业的群众运动能够迅速的展开，并形成了今天这样的规模，主要关键在于加强党的领导，第一书记亲自挂帅，从县委到各公社都坚持了工农业同时并举的方针。对工业的领导工作，县、社党委都设一书记专门负责，并抽调了一百九十二名干部集中抓工业，县、社都设立了工业办公室，各公社还组织了工业建设指挥部，组织专业大军负责到底。
    运动中各级党组织作到以工农业为中心，各项工作全面安排。第一书记一手抓工业，一手抓农业，有的白天到田间，夜晚到工厂。分管工业的书记与工人同吃同住同劳动。工作中抓住四个关键：抓政治思想工作，统一全党全民的思想认识；抓组织群众运动；抓技术，抓生产，作到边规划、边建厂、边生产、边管理。此外还通过抓两头带中间，插红旗拔白旗，评比参观促进运动。
    以上所述是我县一年来大办工业的一些主要情况。由于农村办工业，特别是公社办工业是个新问题，加上我们对上级的指示学习领会不深透，工作中还存在着一些问题。这就是领导思想还落后于生产的需要和群众的要求；其次是运动来势猛，发展快，个别的工厂对质量有所忽视，或者工厂建起来不能迅速进行正常生产，这都是今后应当特别注意解决的。
