Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 9th: The first session of the Second People's Congress of Hubei Province was held from December 2nd to 6th.

    Hubei Province Governor Zhang Tixue delivered a "Work Report of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee" at the meeting. In summarizing the main achievements of the province's Great Leap Forward over the past year, he said that the province's total industrial output value in 1958 is expected to increase by 82.2% compared with last year. In particular, since the province launched the mass movement of the whole people running industry with steel as the key link, it has not only led to a rapid increase in steel production this year compared with previous years, but has also driven various tasks forward. Politically, the whole people making steel has also trained people. Agriculture has also achieved an inspiring and unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain, cotton, and oil crops all increasing by more than double compared with last year, making Hubei Province jump to become a "thousand-jin province," with an average of about 1,500 jin of grain per person, thus fundamentally reversing the tense grain situation of previous years.

    When discussing the province's production tasks for next year, Zhang Tixue pointed out that, based on the experience of 1958, the focus should still be on grasping steel. While ensuring the Great Leap Forward in major raw materials and basic industries, light industry should be developed accordingly. To this end, it is necessary to adhere to vigorously carrying out mass movements, adhere to the combination of "small, indigenous, and mass" and "large, foreign, and mass," with "large and foreign" as the backbone, combining large, medium, and small, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improving. The output of steel and other products next year will be greatly increased compared with this year. Measures should also be taken to ensure the construction of large-scale factories and mines such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Daye Steel Plant, Hubei Iron and Steel Plant, Yidu Heavy Machinery Plant, and the province's large-scale water conservancy backbone projects.

    Zhang Tixue pointed out in his report that although agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest this year, we should not be satisfied with the status quo. In the future, we must vigorously carry out socialist and communist emulation movements to give full play to the masses' high enthusiasm and creativity and strive for an even greater bumper harvest next year. To this end, we must continue to implement the eight fundamental measures for increasing agricultural production, including water, fertilizer, soil, deep plowing, and close planting.

    Zhang Tixue finally pointed out that the central link in rural work this winter and next spring is to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, earnestly grasp ideological education, carry out socialist and communist education movements, vigorously grasp production, vigorously grasp life, and combine them together. In the socialist and communist education movement, we must educate cadres at all levels to fully promote democracy in their work, distinguish between the methods of handling two different types of contradictions, and oppose the phenomenon of superficiality and impracticality in their work.

    The more than 400 representatives attending the meeting unanimously expressed satisfaction with the government's work and adopted the report.

    The meeting finally elected Wang Renzhong and 52 others to form the new Provincial People's Committee, elected Zhang Tixue as Governor of Hubei Province, and Zhao Xinchu, Liu Jisun, Li Minghao, Chen Yixin, Chen Jingshe, Meng Futang, Nie Guoqing, Wang Haishan, Chen Li and nine others as Deputy Governors; Yang Ziming as President of the Provincial Higher People's Court.

    湖北省举行人代大会
    选出省长和出席全国人代大会代表
    新华社武汉9日电  湖北省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议在2日到6日举行。
    湖北省省长张体学在会上作了“湖北省人民委员会工作报告”。他在总结一年来全省大跃进的主要成就时说，1958年全省工业总产值预计可比去年增长82.2％，特别是全省开展以钢为纲、全民办工业的群众运动以后，不仅使今年的钢铁产量比历年有了迅速的增长，而且还带动了各项工作；在政治上，由于全民办钢铁，同时还锻炼了人。农业也获得了振奋人心的空前大丰收，粮食、棉花、油料作物等都比去年增长一倍以上，使湖北省一跃而为千斤省，平均每人有粮食一千五百斤左右，从而基本上扭转了历年粮食紧张的局面。
    张体学谈到明年全省的生产任务时指出，根据1958年的经验，仍应首先以抓钢铁为中心，在保证主要原材料基本工业大跃进的前提下，相应地发展轻工业。为此，必须坚持大搞群众运动，坚持“小、土、群”和“大、洋、群”相结合，以“大、洋”为骨干，大中小并举，土洋结合，逐步提高的方针。明年的钢铁等产量和今年比都将有很大的提高。还要采取措施，保证武钢、大冶钢厂、湖北钢铁厂、宜都重型机床厂等大型厂矿和全省大型水利骨干工程的建设。
    张体学在报告中指出，今年农业虽然大丰收，但是不应满足现状。今后必须大力开展社会主义和共产主义竞赛运动，以发挥群众高度的积极性和创造性，争取明年的更大丰收。为此，必须继续贯彻水、肥、土、深耕、密植等八项农业增产的根本措施。
    张体学最后指出，今冬明春农村工作的中心环节，是整顿与巩固人民公社，认真地大抓思想教育、开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动，大抓生产、大抓生活，并且要相互结合起来进行。在社会主义与共产主义教育运动中，必须教育各级干部在工作中充分发扬民主，分清两类矛盾的处理方法，并且要反对工作中浮而不实的现象。
    出席会议的四百多名代表，对政府工作一致表示满意，并通过了这个报告。
    会议最后选出王任重等五十三人组成新的省人民委员会，选举张体学为湖北省省长，赵辛初、刘济荪、李明灏、陈一新、陈经畲、孟夫唐、聂国青、王海山、陈离等九人为副省长；杨子明为省高级人民法院院长。会议还选出第二届全国人民代表大会的代表四十八人，他们是：王涛、王全煌、王家楫、邓子恢、邓裕志（女）、田恩波、刘西元、朱早弟（女）、朱国蕴（女）、刘劲、宋一平、李书城、李文宜（女）、李四光、李先念、李冬青（女）、李达、李范一、李国伟、余益庵、周小燕（女）、官木生、周仲英、陈离、陈经畬、胡锡奎、唐午园、夏以焜、夏坚白、涂长望、唐棣华（女）、黄序周、黄松龄、曹禺、梅龚彬、汤用彤、董必武、张体学、张难先、彭仰钦、杨献珍、贾琏（女）、杨德重、熊子民、鲍鼎、戴芳澜、萨本炘、饶兴礼。
