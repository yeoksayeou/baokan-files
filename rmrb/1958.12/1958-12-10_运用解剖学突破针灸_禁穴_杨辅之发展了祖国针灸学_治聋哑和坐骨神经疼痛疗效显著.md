    Applying Anatomy to Break Through Acupuncture "Forbidden Points"
    Yang Fuzhi Develops National Acupuncture Science
    Significant Effects in Treating Deaf-Muteness and Sciatic Nerve Pain
    (Our Wuhan Dispatch) Reporter Zhang Wei reports: Yang Fuzhi, a doctor at the People's Hospital of Tianmen County, Hubei, boldly broke through the "forbidden points" in acupuncture while studying it, and achieved significant results in treating deaf-muteness using acupuncture electrotherapy.
    In the past two years, Yang Fuzhi has treated a total of 146 cases of deaf-muteness and deafness, of which 87 were completely cured (hearing in both ears was restored, able to hear the sound of a watch, and able to answer simple sentences after being taught to speak), and 50 showed improvement (able to hear lower sounds, able to speak short sentences of three to five words) (of which 33 had significant effects but did not complete treatment), with an effectiveness rate of 93.8%.
    According to Yang Fuzhi's experience in treating deaf-muteness, congenital deaf-muteness has a higher therapeutic effect; secondary deaf-muteness and deafness, even if the eardrum has perforated but the edges remain neat, also have therapeutic effects; severe sequelae of encephalitis or those caused by syphilis, tuberculosis, etc., that cause severe organic changes in the middle ear and vocal cords are ineffective.
    Yang Fuzhi was originally a young Western medicine doctor. In 1954, he responded to the Party's call to learn from traditional Chinese medicine and began to study acupuncture. In the process of learning and using acupuncture for treatment, he also demonstrated a spirit of daring to think and act creatively. For example, acupuncture literature stipulates that "Yamen" (Gate of Deafness) is a forbidden point for deep needling and moxibustion. However, based on his understanding of anatomy and the structure of the human body, he boldly used himself as a test subject, breaking through the "forbidden point" and greatly improving the therapeutic effect. The specific method he used in treating deaf-muteness was to deeply puncture acupoints such as "Yamen" and combine it with steel needle conduction electrotherapy.
    Based on the spirit of breaking through "forbidden points" in the treatment of deaf-muteness, Yang Fuzhi further developed and broke through twenty-seven more "forbidden points" (books stipulate that there are seventy forbidden points in the human body), and also achieved very high therapeutic effects in the treatment of sciatic nerve pain, stroke, facial nerve paralysis, etc. He treated a total of 853 patients with sciatic nerve pain, all 814 were completely cured, and 36 of them had immediate effects after one acupuncture treatment. Liu Xiaohai suffered from sciatic nerve pain and could not get out of bed for four months. Others carried him on a door panel for treatment. After one acupuncture session by Yang Fuzhi, Liu Xiaohai carried the door panel back himself half an hour later.
    Yang Fuzhi's original education level was not high, but due to his diligent study and humble learning, he overcame many difficulties in treatment. When he first started acupuncture, patients reported that it was painful. He inquired from patients about the residence of Dr. Wu, who was known for painless needling, and ran more than forty li to Dr. Wu's place that night to ask for advice. In order to understand electrical knowledge and implement steel needle conduction electrotherapy, he not only read reference books and studied junior and senior high school physics, but also ran to schools, radio stations, post and telecommunications bureaus and other units to ask for advice.
    Throughout the entire process of Yang Fuzhi's research and application of acupuncture to treat deaf-muteness, he received the full support and help of the Party and hospital leaders. After he proposed that "Yamen" could be deeply punctured, the hospital director immediately encouraged him and decided to divide the patients into two groups, one receiving deep puncture treatment and the other shallow puncture treatment, proving that the therapeutic effect of deep puncture was higher than that of shallow puncture. The hospital branch organized ENT doctors to help him examine the patients' eardrum conditions, and also organized veteran TCM doctors who knew acupuncture to help him solve difficult problems in treatment at any time.

    运用解剖学突破针灸“禁穴”
    杨辅之发展了祖国针灸学
    治聋哑和坐骨神经疼痛疗效显著
    本报武汉讯  记者张碨报道：湖北天门县人民医院医生杨辅之在学习针灸中，大胆突破针灸学上的“禁穴”，利用针灸导电法治疗聋哑获得了显著的效果。
    两年来，杨辅之共治疗聋哑症及耳聋症一百四十六例，治疗痊愈的（双耳听力恢复，能听手表声音，经过教话，能回答简单的话句）八十七例，有进步的（能听到较低的声音，能说三个到五个字的短句）五十例（其中有三十三例的疗效显著，但未完成治疗），疗效达到93.8％。
    根据杨辅之治疗聋哑的经验，以先天性聋哑的疗效较高；继发性聋哑症及耳聋症的鼓膜虽已穿孔，但边缘仍整齐存在的都有疗效；严重的脑炎后遗症或因梅毒、肺结核等引起的、并致使中耳、声带有严重的器质性改变者无效。
    杨辅之原是个年轻的西医医士。1954年，他响应党的向中医学习的号召，开始学习针灸。在学习和运用针灸治疗中，又发挥了敢想敢干的创造精神。比如，针灸文献上规定了“哑门”是禁止深针、禁止灸疗的穴位。而他根据对解剖学关于人体构造的了解，大胆地以自身作为试验，突破了“禁穴”，大大提高了疗效。在治疗聋哑中，他使用的具体方法，就是对“哑门”等穴位进行深刺，并结合实行了钢针导线通电。
    杨辅之还根据治疗聋哑突破“禁穴”的精神加以发挥，又突破了二十七个“禁穴”（书上规定人体有七十个禁穴），在治疗坐骨神经疼痛、中风、颜面神经麻痹等症方面，也获得了很高的疗效。他共治了八百五十三个坐骨神经疼患者，全部治好的八百十四个，其中有三十六个是一次针灸治疗立即见效的。刘小海患坐骨神经疼痛，躺了四个月不能起床，别人用门板把他抬来治疗，经过杨辅之一次针灸，半小时后，刘小海自己把门板背着回去了。
    杨辅之原有的文化程度不高，但是由于刻苦钻研和虚心学习，克服了许多治疗上的困难。开始扎针时，病人都反映扎的疼。他便向病人打听出扎针不疼的吴老医生的住处，在当晚连夜跑四十多里路到吴老医生那里去请教。他为了弄通电学知识，实行钢针导电治疗，一面翻阅参考书，学习初、高中物理学；一面又跑学校、广播站、邮电局等单位向人请教。
    杨辅之在研究和采用针灸治疗聋哑的整个过程中，得到了党和院领导的全力支持和帮助。在他提出“哑门”可以深刺的问题后，院长立即加以鼓励，并决定把病人分成两个组，分别实行深刺和浅刺的治疗，证明了深刺的疗效高于浅刺。院支部组织了五官科医生帮他检查患者的耳膜情况，还组织中医科会针灸的老医生随时帮助他解决治疗中的疑难问题。（附图片）
