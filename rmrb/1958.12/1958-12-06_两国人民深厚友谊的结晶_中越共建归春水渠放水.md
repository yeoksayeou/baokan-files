Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 5th: The Guichun Canal, symbolizing the profound friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, officially opened its gates for water release on December 1st. To celebrate the canal’s water release, more than 3,000 local representatives and border residents from both China and Vietnam held a three-day joint celebration in Shuolong Town, Daxin County, on the Chinese border, starting from December 1st.

The Guichun Canal was constructed through consultation between the local governments of Daxin County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China and Ha Lang County in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of Vietnam. Construction began on February 1st of this year and was completed on May 21st. The canal is located on the southern bank of the Guichun River on the Sino-Vietnamese border, starting at the foot of Guishan Mountain on the border of Ha Lang County, Vietnam, and ending in Baoyu, Daxin County, China. It is 87 kilometers long, with 14 kilometers within Ha Lang County, Vietnam, and the remaining 73 kilometers within Daxin County, China. During the most intense period of canal construction in April this year, a total of 15,200 laborers from Daxin County, China, and Ha Lang County, Vietnam, participated in the project. The canal irrigates an area of 75,900 mu, of which 73,000 mu are in Daxin County, China, and 2,900 mu are in Ha Lang County, Vietnam.

On the morning of the 1st, before dawn, the delegations from both sides and representatives of border residents participating in the joint celebration successively formed teams and set off, first heading to the dam in Vietnam to participate in the water release ceremony hosted by the Vietnamese side. At 9:10 AM, the water release ceremony began. Zhou Chunhe, Secretary of the Ha Lang County Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and Wang Wenke, First Secretary of the Daxin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting successively. After Comrade Zhou Chunhe cut the ribbon, the surging river water gushed out from the gate and flowed straight down the canal. At this moment, applause and cheers resounded in the ancient valley.

At 3:30 PM, the representatives returned to Shuolong Town and began to hold a joint celebration. At the meeting, Lin Kewu, head of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region delegation of China, Huang Bei, head of the Cao Bang Province People’s Delegation of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of Vietnam, and others spoke successively, jointly congratulating the successful completion of this water conservancy project symbolizing Sino-Vietnamese friendship.

    两国人民深厚友谊的结晶
    中越共建归春水渠放水
    新华社南宁5日电  象征中越两国人民深厚友谊的归春水渠，12月1日正式开闸放水。为了庆祝水渠放水，中越两国地方代表和边境居民三千多人，从12月1日起，在中国边境大新县硕龙镇举行了为期三天的联欢大会。
    归春水渠是由中国广西僮族自治区大新县、越南越北自治区下琅县双方地方政府协商，在今年2月1日开始动工，到5月21日建成的。渠道位于中越边界上的归春河的南岸，由越南下琅县边境上的龟山脚下修起，到中国的大新县宝圩止，全长八十七公里，其中有十四公里在越南下琅县境内，其余七十三公里在我国大新县境内。今年4月，水渠工程施工最紧张时，参加修渠的有我国大新县和越南下琅县的民工共一万五千二百人。这条水渠灌溉面积为七万五千九百亩，其中我国大新县七万三千亩，越南下琅县二千九百亩。
    1日早上，天还没亮，参加联欢大会的双方代表团及边境人民代表，就陆续整队出发，首先前往越南境内的拦河坝参加了由越南方面主持的放水典礼。上午九时十分，放水典礼开始。越南劳动党下琅县委书记周春和、中国共产党大新县委第一书记王文科，先后在大会上讲了话。周春和同志剪采后，汹涌的河水从闸口喷射而出，沿着渠道直泻而下。这时鼓掌声、欢呼声响成一片，震动了古老的山谷。
    下午三点半钟，代表们回到硕龙镇，开始举行联欢大会。会上，我国广西僮族自治区代表团团长林克武、越南越北自治区高平省人民代表团团长黄北等先后讲话，共同祝贺这条象征中越友谊的水利工程胜利建成。当晚参加大会的双方代表三千余人举行了会餐，并表演了文艺节目。联欢会在3日晚上闭幕。
