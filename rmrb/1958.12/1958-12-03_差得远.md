    "Far From Enough"
    Ma Tieding
    The Great Leap Forward in China's industrial production, the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and the Great Leap Forward in scientific and cultural undertakings, with their immense power and speed, have made it impossible for our friends and enemies to ignore them as a central topic of discussion.

    Faced with ironclad facts, the bourgeois press has had to exclaim in alarm about the "Oriental Dragon." However, their class instincts prevent them from abandoning their hostility towards the socialist system, even in their twilight years. They initially shut their eyes and refused to acknowledge it, shaking their heads and saying: "Is there such a thing? Grain production doubled, steel production doubled, I have never seen it."

    Facts are facts after all, and when the facts accumulated more and more, piled higher and higher, until they touched the tips of their noses, they could not help but open their eyes to take a look. Thus, from the "never seen it" argument, they developed another line of reasoning. For example, the British hardware industry's main publication, "Hardware Trade Journal," wrote: "The People's Republic of China openly declares that it intends to surpass Britain in steel production within the next few years. However, this goal should be viewed comprehensively. If this goal is achieved, it will undoubtedly be a victory for a basically agricultural country in rapid industrialization, but if one remembers that China has more than 600 million people, then the average consumption per person will still be very small. ..." The meaning is nothing more than saying: although your total output will soon catch up with us, on a per capita basis, it is still far from enough!

    Sir, you are right! On a per capita basis, catching up with you is indeed still far from enough! We will certainly use a speed that you dare not believe, and at the same time strive to surpass you according to our specific needs, there is no doubt about this. The same phrase "far from enough," one expression, two different meanings: You say "far from enough," firstly, as self-consolation, and secondly, in an attempt to "deflate" the "spirit" of the Chinese people: What are you so busy about? Getting up early and staying up late, making yourselves so tired, in the end, it is still far from enough, I think you should take a rest! But this bowl of mesmerizing soup, you should drink it yourself, we will not be fooled. We also admit "far from enough," that is just to say that we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements, we must spur on our horses, catch up, continue our efforts, and move forward bravely! We not only understand "comprehensive viewing," but also understand viewing from a developmental perspective.

    Gentlemen, your situation is rolling down the mountain (here, it is no harm to give an example: compared with the same period last year, US steel production fell by 35% in the first eight months of this year), but we are walking up the mountain from the foot. One day, we may meet you on the mountainside. In this brief moment, we will exchange glances. After that? You keep rolling down the mountain, and finally climb into the grave, but we, one peak higher than another, one mountain after another, and finally climb to the peak of Mount Tai of communism. Isn't it? Indeed, it is truly far from enough! It is not only far from enough, it is simply two incomparable things. How can entering the grave be compared with climbing to the top of Mount Tai?

    The Western world temporarily has a few more tons of steel, and even this point, we must use practice to shut the mouths of the reactionary forces as quickly as possible. Advance bravely from this "far from enough" to another "far from enough"!

    “差得远”
    马铁丁
    我国工业生产的大跃进，农业生产的大跃进，科学文化事业的大跃进，威力如此之大，速度如此之快，使我们的朋友和敌人，都不能不把它作为谈论的中心。
    在铁打的事实前面，资产阶级报刊，不得不为“东方巨龙”惊呼了。可是，它们的阶级本能，使它们即使到了日暮途穷的时候，也不放弃对社会主义制度的敌视态度。它们先是闭着眼睛不看，摇头不承认：“有这样的事吗？粮食增产一倍，钢铁翻一番，我从来没有见过。”
    事实究竟是事实，等到事实越积越多，越累越高，以致触到他们鼻尖的时候，他们也就不能不睁开眼睛看看。于是从“从来没有见过”论，发展到另一个论调，例如英国五金业的主要刊物“五金业公报”写道：“中华人民共和国公开声称它打算在今后几年之内在钢产量上超过英国。不过这个目标应该从全面看。如果实现这个目标，无疑是一个基本上农业化的国家在迅速工业化方面的一个胜利，但是，如果记得中国有六亿之多的人口，那么每个人的平均消费量仍将很小。……”那意思无非是说：你们的总产量虽然很快就要赶上了我们，但是，按人口平均，还差得远呢！
    先生，你讲得对！按人口平均，赶上你们，现在确实还差得远！我们一定会用你们不敢相信的速度，同时根据我们的具体需要努力超过你们，这是没有任何疑问的。同一个“差得远”，一种语言，两种不同的含意：你说“差得远”，一来是自我安慰，二来是企图“泄”中国人民之“气”：忙个什么呢？起早带晚，弄得怪累的，到头来还是差得远，我看还是歇歇吧！可是这碗迷魂汤，还是你自己喝，我们是不会上当的。我们也承认“差得远”，那只不过是说，我们决不会满足于现有的成绩，要快马加鞭，迎头赶上，再接再厉，勇往直前！我们不仅懂得“全面的看”，而且懂得从发展的观点看。
    先生们，你们的处境是从山上往山下滚，（这里无妨举个例子：今年头八个月和去年同期相比，美国钢产量下降35％）我们却是从山下往山上走。可能有一天在山腰我你相遇。在这短暂的一瞬，相互照个面。这之后呢？你一直滚到山下，最后爬进坟墓，我们呢，一峰高一峰，一山又一山，最后攀登到共产主义的泰山之巅。可不是吗？确确实实差得远！岂仅是差得远，简直是不能比的两码子事。进了坟墓里和登上泰山之巅怎么能相比呢？
    西方世界暂时还多几吨钢铁，就连这一点，我们也要尽可能快地用实践来封住反动势力的嘴巴。从这个“差得远”向另一个“差得远”奋勇前进！
