Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 11th – Recently, the Zhongning County People's Court in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, in handling relatively significant criminal cases, created a method of adjudicating cases that "combines court trials with mass exposure, accusation, debate, and the posting of big-character posters," pushing the mass line in adjudication work a step forward.

This approach demonstrates the superiority of the mass line even more than the previous practice of circuit courts. This new method involves: allowing the masses to expose the crimes of the accused in court; allowing the masses to accuse, testify, and post big-character posters; and allowing the defendants to engage in debate with those who expose them. Simultaneously, the masses can also expose other bad people and bad deeds; they can help those criminals who have not been discovered to confess their crimes in court; and those who have committed illegal acts or serious errors but have not progressed to the point of committing crimes are allowed to express their attitudes. The court's activities are interwoven with mass exposure, accusation, and debate. This approach allows the masses to directly participate in the trial activities, daring to boldly and face-to-face struggle with criminals, and helping the court to more quickly and accurately ascertain the facts of the case. This ensures that adjudication work not only relies on the masses in the investigation but also develops to the point where cases are handed over to the masses for debate, offering reasonable opinions for the court to consider when making judgments, preventing judges from subjectively and one-sidedly judging the facts of the case.

The Zhongning County People's Court has already used this approach to hold court three times. When the Dongfeng People's Commune dealt with the case of four accountants of the Shangqiao Brigade embezzling more than 300 yuan, the masses posted 279 big-character posters and cartoons. On November 13th, when dealing with the case of Wen Xingxiu's abuse of his adopted son leading to death, the masses posted 101 big-character posters. The issues exposed by the accusations were largely confirmed by the court's verification, and the proposed handling opinions were also relatively reasonable and legal. In the three court sessions, in addition to exposing and accusing the five criminals on trial, the masses also exposed more than twenty people who had committed embezzlement, three people who had abused the elderly and children, as well as other lawless and undisciplined elements. In these three trials, a total of nine people confessed their problems on the spot, including four who confessed to embezzlement and five who confessed to abuse. After the court adjourned, two more embezzlers brought the stolen money to the court to confess. This phenomenon of on-the-spot confession and self-surrender and people with mistakes stepping forward to express their attitudes was rarely seen in the past, which played a great role in raising the political awareness and legal consciousness of the masses and further preventing criminal behavior.

The court carefully treated the exposed and accused issues. The court only dealt with the facts of the crimes of the accused after carefully verifying that they were true; the newly exposed bad people and bad deeds were investigated and researched by the court in conjunction with the public security and procuratorial departments after the court adjourned before deciding whether to accept them.

At the beginning of this practice, some cadres were skeptical. They believed that doing so was "irregular" and "not serious," and they were afraid that handing over the case to the masses for debate and exposure would "create chaos" and "make it impossible to step down." After three court sessions, these incorrect views were completely refuted. Not only did it not "create chaos," but the court order was very good, and the masses treated the handling of the case with a very serious attitude. All the exposed and accused materials and the reasons for the debate were well-founded, which helped the court to clarify the problems that were not easily discovered in general investigations and supplemented the evidence. Moreover, taking the mass line in this way made the masses, the Party committee, and the cadres very satisfied: First of all, allowing the masses to directly participate in the trial activities, exposing and accusing the criminals they hated, and supervising the trial activities, the masses were very satisfied. Secondly, because it directly cooperated with the central work of the Party committee, the Party committee was also very satisfied with the court's approach. Thirdly, because the broad masses participated in the trial activities, cracked down on criminals in the commune, and strengthened the masses' sense of loving the commune like their home and protecting public property, the commune cadres found their work easier, so the commune cadres were also very satisfied.

### 法庭上开“辩论会”  审判工作中的群众路线在中宁县有了新发展  群众直接参与审判面对面同犯罪分子作斗争

    法庭上开“辩论会”
    审判工作中的群众路线在中宁县有了新发展
    群众直接参与审判面对面同犯罪分子作斗争
    新华社银川11日电  最近宁夏回族自治区中宁县人民法院在审理比较重大的刑事案件中，创造了“法庭审判和群众揭发、检举、辩论、张贴大字报相结合”的审理案件方法，把审判工作中的群众路线又向前发展了一步。
    这种作法较之以往的法庭巡回就审的作法，更显示出群众路线的优越性。这种新的作法是：在法庭上群众可以揭发被审判者的罪行，允许群众控诉、作证和贴大字报，被告人可以和检举者展开辩论；同时，群众还可以检举其他的坏人坏事；可以帮助那些未被发现的犯罪人当庭坦白自首；允许有违法行为或严重错误但未发展到犯罪程度的人表示态度。法庭的活动是和群众揭发、检举、辩论穿插进行的。这种作法使群众直接参与了审判活动，敢于大胆地、面对面地同犯罪分子据理斗争，帮助法庭更迅速、更准确地查清案情。这样就使审判工作不仅在调查中依靠群众，而且发展到把案件交给群众进行辩论，提出可供法庭判决时作参考的合理意见，防止审判人员主观、片面地审判案情。
    中宁县人民法院已经采用这种作法开庭三次。在东风人民公社处理上桥大队四个会计贪污三百元以上的案件时，群众贴出大字报、漫画二百七十九张。11月13日处理温兴秀虐待养子致死案件时，群众贴出大字报一百零一张。检举揭发的问题经法院对证大部属实，提出的处理意见也比较合理合法。在三次开庭中，群众除了揭发检举被审判的五个犯罪分子外，还揭发出二十几名有贪污行为的人和三名虐待老人、子女的人，以及其他违法乱纪的分子。在这三次审判中共有九人当场坦白了自己的问题，其中有四人交代贪污问题，有五人交代虐待行为，闭庭后又有两个贪污分子带着赃款到法庭坦白。这样当庭坦白自首和有错误的人站出来表示态度的现象是过去很少见到的，这对提高群众的政治觉悟和法制观念，进一步制止犯罪行为起了很大的作用。
    法庭慎重地对待了揭发、检举出的问题。对被审判者的犯罪事实，法庭都是认真查证属实后才进行处理；对新揭发的坏人坏事，都是在闭庭后，经过同公安、检察部门进行调查研究，才决定受理与否。
    这种作法在试行之初，有些干部是怀疑的。认为这样做“不正规”、“不严肃”，怕把案件交给群众辩论、揭发，会“乱套”、“下不了台”。经过三次开庭，彻底驳倒了这些不正确的看法，不仅没有“乱套”，而且法庭秩序很好，群众都以非常认真严肃的态度来对待案件的处理，所有揭发、检举的材料和辩论的理由，都有理有据，这样就帮助法庭查清了在一般调查中所不大容易发现的问题，补充了证据。而且这样大走群众路线，使群众、党委、干部都很满意：首先，让群众直接参加了审判活动，揭发检举审理了自己所痛恨的犯罪分子，又监督了审判活动，群众非常满意。其次，由于直接配合了党委的中心工作，因此党委对法院这样做也很满意。第三，由于广大群众参加了审判活动，打击了公社内的犯罪分子，群众爱社如家，爱护公共财产的思想加强了，社干部工作好做了，因此社干部也很满意。
