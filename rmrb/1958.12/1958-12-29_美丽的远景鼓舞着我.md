    Beautiful Prospects Inspire Me
    Worker, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory
    In the old society, my family was dirt poor. I started working in a factory at a young age and never attended school for a single day. After liberation, the working class became masters of the country, and the poor were emancipated. The factory established spare-time schools for us workers. I attended a spare-time elementary school class, learned some characters, and gradually became able to read newspapers and write letters. However, there were many difficulties in production, such as not being able to understand drawings, not knowing how to calculate, and lacking scientific and technological knowledge, so production efficiency could never be improved. This made me feel that to truly be masters of our country, we must continue to work hard to study culture. So, I went to senior elementary school, and then to a junior technical school. The knowledge I learned could gradually be applied to production. This made me love learning more and more, and love working more and more. In 1956, I used the cultural knowledge I had learned to create a gear hobbing machine, which increased work efficiency by more than one time. This year, the factory established a part-work, part-study Red Flag University, I was extremely happy, and quickly signed up. There were indeed many difficulties in learning. This principle, that formula, made me dizzy, but the Party cared for me, and my comrades encouraged me. When I thought of the pain of the old society and the bright future of communism, my confidence in learning increased. Under any difficulties, I can persevere. The knowledge I have learned has been more helpful in improving technology and increasing production than in the past. Working has become easier, and I am happy all day long. In the morning, I carry my books to the classroom in the building to study, and in the afternoon, I work in the workshop, engaging in scientific research. A few days ago, I and six workers, including Xu Wenzhu of our workshop's scientific research institute, used the cultural knowledge we had learned to jointly research and design a indigenous gear rolling machine. This machine saved more than ten tons of steel and 140,000 yuan compared to a foreign gear machine of the same capacity. We also used geometric principles, trigonometry, mapping and other knowledge to successfully design a multi-head drill that drills six holes, increasing efficiency by more than six times. Now, everyone in our factory is going to school and everyone is engaged in scientific research. Seeing this, I am very happy! Before liberation, we were beasts of burden, and now we go to university and engage in scientific research. We workers have truly been emancipated.
    In the past, I never dared to even dream of going to university. I deeply realize that I can only become a college student under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. I will never let down the Party's expectations of me. Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, I will definitely study hard and strive to become a college graduate within four years.

    美丽的远景鼓舞着我
    山西机床厂工人  张月云
    在旧社会里，我家穷得精光响。我从小就进工厂当工人，没有念过一天书。解放后，工人当家做主，穷人翻身了。厂里为我们工人成立了业余学校。我上了业余初小班学习，认了一些字，慢慢能看报写信了。但是，在生产中有许多困难，如看不懂图，不会计算，没有科学技术知识等，所以生产效率总是提不高。这使我感到要真正当家做主，就必须继续努力学习文化。于是，我上了高小，又上了初级技术学校，学的知识就逐渐能用到生产上了。这使我越学越爱学，越学越爱干。1956年，我利用学到的文化知识，创造了一个跑齿机，提高工作效率一倍多。今年厂里办起了半工半读红旗大学，我高兴极了，就赶快报了名。在学习中困难确实不少，这个原理，那个公式，搞得我头昏眼花，但是，党关怀我，同志们鼓励我，一想起旧社会的痛苦和共产主义的远景，学习信心就增强了。在任何困难下，我都能坚持下去，学到的知识对改进技术和提高生产的帮助比过去更大了，干起活来也轻松了，整天乐洋洋的，上午挟着书本到大楼课堂学习，下午在车间干活，搞科学研究。前些日子，我和我们车间的科学研究所的成员徐文烛等六个工人，利用自己学到的文化知识，共同研究设计成了一台土滚齿机，这架机器比一台同等能力的洋齿机节省了十几吨钢材，还节省了十四万元。我们还运用几何原理、三角、制图等知识，设计成功一种钻六个孔的多头钻，提高了效率六倍多。现在，我们厂里人人都上学，人人搞科学研究，看到这些我就心里乐啦！解放前做牛马，如今上大学，研究科学，我们工人真正翻身了。
    我过去对上大学真是想也不敢想。我深深体会到只有在党和毛主席的英明领导下我才能成为大学生。我决不辜负党对我的期望。在党的教育方针照耀下，我一定努力学习，争取在四年内成为一个大学毕业生。
