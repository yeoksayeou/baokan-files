Friends, Qinghai Welcomes You!
——A Letter from the Frontier

Young friends:

Let me tell you about the joyous, vibrant life in Qinghai.

Our residence is in a vast grassland stretching hundreds of miles. The verdant turf is dotted with flowers of various colors, and the Qilian and Daban Mountains embrace us like the arms of two giants.

In the morning, the pure white clouds, like a giant dragon, quietly crawl along the foothills, and soon, the entire foothills are covered by them. At this time, we feel as if we have entered a fairyland surrounded by white jade ramparts. After a gust of wind sweeps through,朵朵白云飞上了蔚蓝的晴空, only a few wisps of cloud, still infatuated with the mountains, hover between the peaks.

Currently, my task is to prospect for minerals. As soon as I leave, I "take a horse." With a flick of the whip, the horse gallops away, and sitting on its back is like riding through the clouds, with the wind howling wildly in my ears.

We traveled day after day, finding lodging wherever we were when evening fell. After four days, we reached the copper mine. At this time of year, it is high summer in the interior, but the mine is covered in heavy snow, and soon the earth is draped in a silvery white coat.

In the morning, we set off for the summit. After climbing one mountain, there was another even higher mountain in front of us.

This hilltop was very steep, with more than a foot of snow accumulated on it. I said, "How are we going to get up this mountain? Should we use ropes?!" "No, we can go up along that serpentine path!" the comrade next to me explained. I looked in the direction he pointed and could barely make out a faint trail worn by people.

After resting for a while, we advanced towards the highest peak. Along the way, we were particularly thirsty, so we would climb a short distance, sit on the snow for a while, eat a few mouthfuls of snow, and then climb again. The cool, moist, and clean snow was extremely comfortable on our throats.

After reaching the summit, we looked around: Ah—, all we could see were undulating and continuous snow-capped mountains, with peaks rising upon peaks. "What a magnificent world!"

After prospecting, we descended the mountain.

The next morning, carrying a bag of ore and specimens, I excitedly rode my horse back to the field. Along the way, my heart was filled with joy and comfort. I clearly realized that this exercise had made my willpower and physical strength more resilient than before.

Young friends, life here is so vibrant and colorful!

In front of our residence, in the lush green pines of Menyuan County: exquisite houses with red walls and gray tiles, like tens of thousands of flowers blooming in spring, sprang up in the blink of an eye; then, a tall and majestic theater rose from the ground; in the city, the number of people from the interior increased day by day, and it was as lively as a fair every day: comrades wearing brightly colored clothes and floral scarves, young people dressed in inland fashion, going in and out, bustling and exceptionally busy, and the cheerful Peking opera broadcast throughout the city, ... Every time I found myself in this environment, I felt like I had returned to my hometown—Shanghai, and a sense of intimacy welled up in my heart, and my spirit was so joyful and comfortable.

Young friends, telling you this much is enough. Come on, the vibrant life of Qinghai awaits you! Qinghai welcomes you!

### 朋友，青海欢迎你们！——从边疆寄来的一封信

    朋友，青海欢迎你们！
    ——从边疆寄来的一封信
    青年朋友们：
    我告诉你们一些青海的欢乐、沸腾的生活吧。
    我们的住处是几百里的大草原，绿绒般的草坪上布满了各色花草，祁连山、大坂山像两只巨人的臂膀，环抱着我们。
    早晨，皎洁的白云，像一条巨龙沿山麓悄悄蠕动，一会，整个山麓被她复盖了。这时，我们就像走入了四周是白玉长城的仙境。一阵风掠过后，朵朵白云飞上了蔚蓝的晴空，只有几条迷恋山峦的云条，仍悬浮在山峰与山峰之间。
    当前，我的任务是看矿去。我一出门即“带马”。马鞭一扬，马儿就扑通扑通飞奔起来，坐在马背上像腾云架雾一样，耳边风呼呼地狂吼着。
    我们走了一天又一天，傍晚走到哪就在哪借宿。四天后，赶到铜矿了。这时节，内地正是盛夏，但矿山却下着大雪，一会，大地就披上了皑皑的银衫。
    早上，我们向山顶出发。爬上了一座山，眼前又是一座更高的山。
    这个山头非常陡，积着一尺多深的雪，我说：“这山怎么上呵？得用绳子吧？！”“不用，沿那条蛇形道能上去！”旁边的同志解释说。我沿他指的方向看去，才看出一条人们踩出的、隐隐的路迹。
    休息了一会，我们向最高山头进军了。一路上口特别渴，于是，我们就爬一程，在雪地上坐一会，吃几口雪，然后再爬，凉湿的洁雪润着喉咙真舒服极了。
    到山顶后，瞩目四望：啊——，眼下全是起伏连绵的雪峰，重重叠叠峰踊耸立。“多么奇丽的世界！”
    看完矿后，下山了。
    第二天清晨，我带着一包矿石、标本，骑着马兴奋地奔返回场。一路上，心中充满了快乐和慰借，我清楚地觉察到：这次锻炼使我的毅力、体力变得比从前更坚韧了。
    青年朋友们，这儿的生活，就是这样沸腾、丰彩！
    我们住处前面青松葱笼的亹源县：红墙灰瓦的玲珑住房，就像争春怒放的万朵鲜花，一转眼就建了起来；接着，高阔堂皇的剧场又平地耸起了；城里，内地来的人一日比一日多，每天都像集会一样热闹：服饰鲜艳，围着花围巾的女同志，内地打扮的小伙子，此出彼进，熙熙攘攘忙闹异常，加上播音的京剧欢乐地在全城激荡，……我每次置身于这境地中，就好像回到了我的故乡——上海，心中涌起了亲切感，精神是那么欢悦、舒畅。
    青年朋友们，告诉你们这些就够了。来吧，青海沸腾的生活在等待你们！青海欢迎你们！
