Bookbinding Without Thread

Zhang Hongbin, director of the bookbinding workshop at the Tianjin People's Printing Factory, and others have recently successfully created a method of wireless bookbinding, greatly improving work efficiency.

Ordinary bookbinding uses thread or wire. The "wireless bookbinding method" doesn't use a single thread or wire; it only uses bone glue, fish scale glue, and swim bladder glue with added chemicals to adhere the pages together. They also created a crimping machine to press the folded spine of the pages with openings that facilitate glue penetration. Then, they organize the book block, clamp it tightly with boards, and apply various glues in layers to the spine. After drying, the cover is attached to form the book. This reduces four processes compared to thread binding: thread-sewing, roughening the spine, gluing the cloth strip, and pressing. Taking hardcover books as an example, the new method improves work efficiency fifty-fold compared to the old method. It also saves a significant amount of cotton thread and wire. Books bound using the wireless method are of high quality, sturdy, and beautiful. A very heavy, wirelessly bound hardcover book, no matter which page is held up, will not tear the pages.

    订书不用线
    天津人民印刷厂装订车间主任张鸿彬等最近创造成功书籍无线装订法，大大提高了工作效率。
    一般书籍装订，都是用线或铁丝；“无线装订法”连一根线或铁丝也不用，只用加有化学药品的骨胶、鱼鳞胶和鳔胶把书页粘合起来。他们还创造了一架压口机，把书页的折页脊缝压上了便于渗胶的口眼，然后整理成本，用夹板夹紧，在书脊背上分层粘上各种胶，经干燥后装皮成书。这样就比有线装订减少了索线、打毛绳、粘毛绳和压本等四道工序。以精装书为例，新法装订就比旧法提高工作效率五十倍。还节约了大量棉线和铁丝。用无线装订法装订的书籍质量很好，结实美观，一本很重的无线装订的精装书，无论拿到哪页提起来，都不会把书页扯坏。
