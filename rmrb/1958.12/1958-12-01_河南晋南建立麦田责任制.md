    Wheat Field Responsibility System Established in Southern Shanxi, Henan

    (By our reporter) The southern Shanxi region of Shanxi Province, which is a major wheat-producing area, has universally established a wheat field management responsibility system. This ensures that the management of wheat seedlings on over four million mu of basic farmland is carried out with "every plot having its soldier, every area having its general, everyone responsible, and no point missed."

    Currently, the people's communes in southern Shanxi, after rationally planning labor, have extracted more than 320,000 people to form a specialized team for wheat processing and management. They have demarcated management responsibility areas of 15 mu per person, and implemented a system of fixed targets, fixed measures, and fixed times, taking full responsibility from now until the summer harvest next year. Many communes have also written specific requirements on wooden signs, inserted them in the fields, and conduct regular inspections and evaluations.

    With the establishment of the wheat field management responsibility system, the sense of responsibility of the masses has been greatly enhanced, and wheat field management work is progressing quickly and well. The 111,000-plus wheat specialist team fighters in Jishan, Yuncheng and other counties have unanimously put forward the grand slogan of "transforming spring processing into winter processing, not letting any Class III wheat seedlings overwinter, achieving high yields per mu, and everyone launching satellites!" After plot-by-plot inspection and ridge-by-ridge verification, they conducted a thorough assessment of over 1.53 million mu of wheat, and adopted management measures such as topdressing, watering, and replanting according to different characteristics. The professional team in Yuncheng County, in just five or six days, not only eliminated the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges in more than 76,000 mu of wheat fields, but also built earth banks and divided small plots in large areas of wheat fields, realizing "ridged fields" in more than 20,000 mu of large wheat fields. In order to ensure that all 45,000 mu of wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer meet the requirement of applying 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, more than 1,000 carts were immediately organized to transport fertilizer.

    This year, the 4.5 million mu of basic wheat fields sown in southern Shanxi are generally growing well compared to previous years due to the serious implementation of yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, applying more fertilizer, selecting superior seeds, and close planting. Some cadres and masses have therefore developed complacency, believing that "wheat seedlings are growing well, no processing is needed; the days of wheat harvest are far away, why be so anxious," thus relaxing the current wheat processing and management work.

    In response to this situation, the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee made a decision to universally establish a wheat field management responsibility system, and dispatched more than 130 agricultural technical cadres to various places to help train wheat professional teams, to ensure the implementation of this measure.

### 河南晋南建立麦田责任制

    河南晋南建立麦田责任制
    本报讯  盛产小麦的山西晋南地区，普遍建立了麦田管理责任制度，使四百多万亩基本农田的麦苗管理做到了“块块有兵，片片有将，人人负责，点点不漏”。
    目前，晋南地区的人民公社，经过合理规划劳力，已抽出三十二万多人组成了一支小麦加工管理的专业队伍。以每人十五亩划定了管理责任区，实行了定指标、定措施、定时间，从现在到明年夏收，一直负责到底。许多公社还把各项具体要求写在木牌上，插在地头，定期检查评比。
    随着麦田管理责任制度的建立，大大地增强了群众的责任心，麦田管理工作进行得又快、又好。稷山、运城等县的十一万一千多名小麦专业队的战斗员们，一致提出了“变春季加工为冬季加工，不让三类麦苗过冬，亩亩都丰产，人人放卫星”的宏伟口号。经过块块查，垅垅验，把一百五十三万多亩小麦进行了一次摸底排队，针对不同特点，分别采取了追肥、浇水、补苗等管理措施。运城县的专业队伍，在五、六天里，不仅消灭了七万六千多亩麦田中的缺苗断垅现象，而且在大片麦田里筑土畔，划小畦，使两万多亩大片麦田实现了“畦田化”。为了把底肥不足的四万五千多亩麦田，全部达到每亩施肥五万斤的要求，立即组织了一千多辆大车赶运肥料。
    晋南地区今年播种的四百五十万亩基本麦田，由于认真贯彻了深耕、多施肥、选用优种、密植等等增产措施，麦苗一般比往年生长良好。有些干部和群众因此而产生自满情绪，认为“麦苗长的好，不需要加工；离麦收的日子远的很，何必性急”，因此放松了当前小麦的加工管理工作。
    中共晋南地委针对这一情况，做出了普遍建立麦田管理责任制度的决定，抽出了一百三十多名农业技术干部分赴各地帮助训练小麦专业队伍，保证这一措施的贯彻。
