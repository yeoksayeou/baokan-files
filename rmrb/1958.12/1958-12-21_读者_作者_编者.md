    Learning from the "Sea Heroes"
    After reading the article "Sea Heroes" published on page 7 of the People's Daily on December 9th, I express my infinite respect to the resolute and fearless naval officers and soldiers like Comrade Zhou Fangshun! And offer my deep condolences to Martyr You Zhimin, who sacrificed his young life for the sacred cause of defending the motherland and liberating Taiwan. The article said that when the speedboat was hit and beyond repair, instructor Zhou Fangshun calmly lowered the national flag from the mast, tucked it into his arms, and jumped into the sea, thinking of living and dying with his comrades and swimming back to the mainland. In such a critical moment, every comrade thought not of themselves, but of the motherland, the collective, and victory. They took care of each other and encouraged each other. Comrade You Zhimin, due to fatigue and serious illness, could no longer swim back to the mainland with them. In his final moments, he requested the instructor to take forty yuan from his savings as his last Party membership dues. This fully demonstrates the heroic qualities of the people's soldiers.
    This article deeply moved me. I am determined to learn from the sea heroes and dedicate everything I have to the cause of defending and building the motherland.  Liu Wanfu, PLA Unit

    Too Few Reports on Primary School Education
    When I receive the People's Daily every day, I always hope to read some news about primary school education that will inspire and help my work. However, there are too few reports in this regard. Nationally speaking, the number of primary school teachers and students is very large. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, there must be many advanced units and outstanding achievements, and we are in great need of learning from the experiences of various places. Therefore, I hope the People's Daily can report more on primary school education.

    Good Experience in Reforming Cooking Tools
    Since the establishment of canteens in rural areas, the ranks of cooks have greatly increased. Reforming cooking tools, reducing labor intensity, and improving efficiency can not only save a large amount of labor but also ensure that the broad masses of commune members eat well. The People's Daily's timely introduction of An'guo County's experience in comprehensively reforming cooking tools on December 6th is of great significance. You can continue to publish experiences in this area.

    Spoke What We All Wanted To Say
    The poem "Every Day Upward" published on page 8 of the People's Daily on the 2nd of this month is a very good poem. All the members of our squadron have read it several times. Everyone is reluctant to let go of the newspaper once they have it, and many people have even copied it down and memorized it. Although this is a report and oath to the Party from the Young Pioneers attending the National Congress of Young Activists, it expresses the love of every Young Pioneer for the leader and their loyalty to the revolution. The poem says what we all wanted to say. We are determined to learn from the spirit and style of the outstanding team members in the poem and aspire to be good successors to the communist cause.
    Dear editors, we hope that the newspaper will reflect more of the lives of our children and teenagers.

    A Lively and Vivid Special Page
    The "Steel Communication Soldiers" special page in the People's Daily on December 7th was excellently edited and can be described as both new and beautiful. The special page focuses on reporting the heroic deeds of postal and telecommunications workers acting as communication soldiers for the "steel marshal," which gives people great encouragement and education. The form is also diverse, lively, and vivid, including news, editorials, short dispatches, cartoons, couplets, etc. May such good special pages appear often.

    向“海上英雄”学习
    读了人民日报12月9日第七版刊登的“海上英雄”一文，我向坚毅无畏的海军官兵周方顺等同志表示无限敬意！对为祖国、为解放台湾的神圣事业献出了年青生命的尤志民烈士致深切悼念。文中说，当快艇被击中，抢救无效时，指导员周方顺镇静地把国旗从桅杆上降下来揣在怀里跳入海中，心里想的是与战友同生共死，游回大陆。在这样紧急关头，每个同志想的不是个人，而是祖国，是集体，是胜利。他们互相照顾，互相鼓励。尤志民同志因疲劳和病重，再也不能一同游回大陆了，临危时请求指导员从他的存款中拿出四十元作为最后一次团费。这充分表现人民战士的英雄本色。
    这篇通讯使我深受感动，我决心要向海上英雄学习，在保卫祖国、建设祖国的事业中，贡献自己的一切。  解放军某部  刘万夫
    小学教育的报道太少了
    当我每天拿到人民日报的时候，总想能够读到一些有关小学教育的消息，使自己工作获得启发和帮助。可是这方面的报道太少了。就全国来说，小学教师和小学生人数非常众多，在这伟大跃进的时代里，一定会出现不少先进单位和优秀事迹，而我们又是多么需要学习各地的经验。因此，我希望人民日报尽可能多报道一些小学教育。

    改革炊事工具的经验好
    由于在农村实现了食堂化，炊事人员的队伍大大增加，改革炊事工具，减轻劳动强度，提高效率，不仅能节约大量劳动力，而且能保证广大社员吃得好。人民日报在12月6日及时地介绍了安国县全面改革炊事工具的经验，有重要的意义。你们还可以继续发表这方面的经验。

    说出了我们大家的话
    人民日报本月2日第八版刊登了“天天向上”这首很好的诗，我们中队全体队员，读了好几次，大家一拿到这张报就不肯放，很多人还把它抄下，念熟了。这虽然是出席全国青年积极分子大会的少先队员们向党的汇报和誓言，但表达了我们每一个少先队员对领袖的敬爱，对革命的忠诚，这诗里说的是我们大家的话。我们决心学习诗中优秀队员的干劲和风格，立志当好共产主义接班人。
    编辑叔叔们，我们很希望报上多反映我们少年儿童的生活。

    生动活泼的专页
    12月7日人民日报的“钢铁通信兵”专页编得出色，可以说是又新又美。专页集中地报道了邮电职工当好钢铁元帅通信兵的英雄事迹，给人以极大的鼓舞和教育。形式也多种多样，生动活泼，有消息、社论、小通讯、漫画、对联等。愿这样好的专页常常有。
