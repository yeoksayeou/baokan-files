Jilin Province's first modern large-scale cotton textile mill, the Changchun Textile Mill, has recently begun construction. This factory will have 100,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. According to the design, it can produce 100,000 bales of cotton yarn and over 30 million meters of cotton cloth annually. After the factory is completed, it will double Jilin Province's cotton cloth production and basically meet the cotton yarn needs of the province's existing weaving mills and knitting mills.

This large-scale cotton textile mill will use domestically produced new-type textile machines, and production will be continuous. The machinery and equipment are equipped with automatic stop devices for full rolls and broken ends.

The factory is currently carrying out foundation engineering construction. The Changchun No. 4 Construction Engineering Company, which is contracting the construction of this factory, plans to launch a mass movement during the construction process and adopt the method of simultaneous construction, installation, and production, so that some workshops can be put into production successively in February next year.

The factory building design has been revised many times according to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Changing the reinforced concrete structure to a brick and wood structure alone can save more than 600 tons of steel and more than 1,000 tons of cement.

    吉林兴建大型棉纺织厂
    吉林省第一座现代化大型棉纺织厂——长春纺织厂，最近动工兴建。这座工厂将拥有十万纱锭、一千台布机。按照设计，每年可以生产棉纱十万件，棉布三千多万公尺。工厂建成后，将使吉林省棉布产量增长一倍，并且基本上满足省内现有织布厂、针织厂所需的棉纱。
    这座大型棉纺织厂将采用国产新型的纺织机，生产将是连续化的。机器设备上装有满卷和断头等自动停止装置。
    这座工厂目前正在进行基础工程施工。承包这座工厂建设工程的长春市第四建筑工程公司准备在修建过程中大搞群众运动，并且采取边建设、边安装、边生产的方法，使部分车间在明年2月就能陆续投入生产。
    这座工厂的厂房设计曾根据多快好省的原则进行了多次修改，其中将钢筋混凝土结构改为砖木结构就可以节约六百多吨钢材、一千多吨水泥。
