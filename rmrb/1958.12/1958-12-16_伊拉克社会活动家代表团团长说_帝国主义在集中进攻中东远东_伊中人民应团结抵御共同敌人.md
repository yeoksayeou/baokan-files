Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Iraqi Republic Social Activists Delegation held a press conference in Beijing this afternoon. The head of the delegation, Naji Yousuf, told Chinese and foreign reporters: "The Iraqi people will always support the Chinese people's just cause of liberating their coastal islands."

Naji Yousuf, the head of the delegation, said: "In all aspects of China that we have visited, we have seen the great peaceful contributions made by the Chinese people in all aspects of economy, culture, and construction. Although our visit to China is short, we are sure that the socialist road China is taking is a road dedicated to happiness and construction." He said, "The Chinese people live very happily, and they are saving as much material as possible for their country, so as to make China the most advanced country in the world. They all believe that the future century will be happier than they are."

Naji Yousuf said: "At present, imperialism is concentrating its attacks on the Middle East and the Far East, creating aggressive conspiracies here, attempting to rule the people of the countries that have been liberated in these two regions and the people of the countries that are striving for liberation and independence. In particular, U.S. imperialism has launched one attack after another, and failure has been accompanying them. However, we should be vigilant, we should unite on the road of struggle, and stop the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. We should help each other when imperialism attacks any country in these two regions, because imperialism is the common enemy of the liberated people and the people who are striving for independence and liberation. The Iraqi people will always support the Chinese people's just cause of liberating their coastal islands."

Naji Yousuf said: "The Iraqi people will work to restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and have representatives of the Chinese people in other international conferences." He said, "The Iraqi people will never forget the help that the Chinese people gave them when the Iraqi and Arab people faced disasters, which were caused by imperialism. Therefore, the Iraqi people are willing to strengthen their relations with the Chinese people in all aspects and develop economic, cultural, and social exchanges."

Naji Yousuf finally said: "We are peace fighters, and we wish the Chinese peace fighters and the great Chinese people the contributions they have made in the struggle to defend world peace and keep the world away from the disaster of war. We will work with them on this road, and stand on the side of the oppressed people and advance shoulder to shoulder with them towards the road of liberation and independence. Victory will surely belong to us!"

More than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters attended the reception.

    伊拉克社会活动家代表团团长说
    帝国主义在集中进攻中东远东
    伊中人民应团结抵御共同敌人
    新华社15日讯  伊拉克共和国社会活动家代表团今天下午在北京举行记者招待会。团长纳吉·优素福对中外记者说：“伊拉克人民永远支持中国人民解放自己的沿海岛屿的正义事业。”
    纳吉·优素福团长说：“在我们访问过的中国各个方面，我们看到了中国人民在经济、文化和建设的各个方面所作的伟大的和平贡献。我们在中国参观访问的时间虽然很短，但是我们肯定，中国所走的社会主义道路，是致力于幸福和建设的道路。”他说：“中国人民生活得非常幸福，他们正在为自己的国家节省出可能节省的物资，以便使中国变成为世界上最先进的国家。他们都相信未来的世纪比他们更幸福。”
    纳吉·优素福团长说：“目前帝国主义正在集中进攻中东和远东两个地区，在这里制造侵略阴谋，企图统治这两个地区已经解放了的国家的人民和正在争取解放、争取独立的国家的人民。特别是美帝国主义发动了一次又一次的进攻，失败一直在伴随着它们。但是，我们应该提高警惕，我们应该在斗争的道路上团结起来，制止帝国主义的侵略阴谋。我们应该在帝国主义进攻这两个地区的任何国家时进行互助，因为帝国主义是解放了的人民和争取独立解放的人民的共同敌人。伊拉克人民永远支持中国人民解放自己的沿海岛屿的正义事业。”
    纳吉·优素福团长说：“伊拉克人民将要为使中华人民共和国恢复在联合国中的合法席位和在其他国际会议中有中国人民的代表而工作。”他说：“伊拉克人民永远不会忘记中国人民在伊拉克和阿拉伯国家人民面临灾难的时候所给予他们的帮助，这种灾难是帝国主义造成的。因此，伊拉克人民愿意加强他们和中国人民的各方面的关系，发展经济、文化和社会交流事业。”
    纳吉·优素福团长最后说：“我们是一些和平战士，我们祝中国的和平战士和伟大的中国人民，在保卫世界和平和使世界远离战争的灾难的斗争中所作的贡献，我们将在这条道路上和他们一起工作，并且站在被压迫人民的一边和他们并肩向着解放和独立的道路前进。胜利一定属于我们！”
    参加这个招待会的，有中外记者二十多人。
