Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 25th: The Chinese Construction Exhibition held here has received over 150,000 visitors in the first five days since its opening.

Among these visitors were members of the royal family, workers, farmers, students, and civil servants. Some visitors came from other provinces. Many Chinese and Vietnamese expatriates also visited the exhibition. Due to the large number of visitors, the exhibition had to extend its daily hours by two hours.

Visitors showed great interest in China's construction, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward. The areas around small improved farm tools, various waterwheels, and biogas generators were crowded.

Over five hundred visitors wrote many moving words in the guestbook. They expressed their praise for China's construction achievements and expressed their confidence in building a prosperous Cambodia.

One visitor wrote that the progress of the Chinese people has given hope to the Asian people in the sense of intelligence and science, and is a heavy blow to the imperialists.

Another visitor wrote that this exhibition shows that China is very sincere to Cambodia. Therefore, we good sons and daughters of Cambodia should learn this knowledge to build our country.

Yet another visitor wrote that the efforts made by the Chinese people deeply touched me. These exhibits made by the Chinese people have brought us valuable experience. I firmly believe that nothing can destroy our friendship.

Cambodian newspapers also attached great importance to the Chinese Exhibition. Many newspapers reported on the exhibition in detail and published some pictures.

    新华社金边25日电  在这里举行的中国建设展览会在开幕后的头五天中已经接待了十五万多名观众。
    在这些观众中有王室成员、工人、农民、学生和公务人员。有些观众还是从外省来的。很多中国和越南的侨民也参观了展览会。由于参观的人太多，展览会不得不把每天展出的时间延长两小时。
    观众对中国的建设，特别是对大丰收的经验表现了极大的兴趣。在小型改良农具、各种水车以及沼气发电机附近，人很拥挤。
    五百余名观众在意见簿上写下了许多动人的话语。他们对中国建设的成就表示赞扬，并且表示有信心建设一个繁荣的柬埔寨。
    一位参观者写道，中国人民的进步在智力和科学的意义上给了亚洲人民以希望，并且是对帝国主义者的一个沉重打击。
    另一位参观者写道，这个展览会表明，中国对柬埔寨是非常真诚的。因此我们柬埔寨的好儿女应该学习这些知识以建设我们的国家。
    又一位参观者写道，中国人民所作的努力深深地感动了我。中国人民所制作的这些展品给我们带来了宝贵的经验。我坚决相信，没有任何东西可以破坏我们的友谊。
    柬埔寨报纸对中国展览会也十分重视。很多报纸都详细地报道了这个展览会，并且刊载了一些图片。
    新华社金边27日电  中国建设展览会代表团团长程照轩今天中午举行招待会招待柬埔寨农业、新闻、计划和外交部等部门的大臣和高级官员。
    出席招待会的还有中国驻柬埔寨大使王幼平、中国经济代表团团长叶景灏和中国大使馆人员。
