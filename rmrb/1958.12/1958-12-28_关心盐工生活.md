    Caring for the Lives of Salt Workers
    Donating Shoes
    Most of the migrant workers building the salt ponds at the Tainan Salt Field in Jiangsu Province come from rural areas, some as far as Fengxian and Peixian counties. They work day and night in the mud and grass, braving the cold. The shoes they brought with them are all worn out. When the employees of the Tainan Salt Field learned of this, a wave of shoe and sock donations immediately swept the field. On the afternoon of December 4th, over a hundred students from the Sixth and Seventh Work Areas organized themselves to deliver 2,128 pairs of shoes and 270 cotton hats to the headquarters. Following this, the employees of the Second Work Area also sent in 15 pairs of shoes and 15 pairs of socks. The employees said, "The peasant brothers are supporting us in building the ponds, away from their homes, and braving hardships. Today we want to show a little appreciation." Fu Linxiang and Zhou Yuzhen personally delivered the cotton socks to the headquarters. The news of the shoe and sock donations spread to various companies, greatly encouraging all the migrant workers building the field. (Chen Pu)
        Building Bathhouses Themselves
    The hardworking and brave salt workers toil year-round, enduring the summer heat and winter cold, persevering in open-air production regardless of wind or rain. Sometimes they are drenched in sweat, and sometimes they are covered in mud and brine. How much they long for a comfortable bath after a day's work! Like other fraternal salt fields, the Hangu Salt Field has always valued and tried to solve this problem, but it cannot be solved all at once. In recent years, the measures taken by this place are: on the one hand, starting to build bathhouses; on the other hand, issuing bath tickets to mobilize workers to go to Hangu Town to take a bath, which only solved part of the problem. With the salt field developing year by year and the number of workers increasing year by year, the original bathhouse has become even more inadequate. Moreover, from the salt field to Hangu Town, the nearest is three or four li, and the farthest is fifty to sixty li. Some workers rarely have time to run to the town to take a bath even if they have bath tickets. Not long ago, the Hangu Salt Field had already built many bathhouses, with three bathhouses that can accommodate seventy to eighty people at a time. Now workers can enjoy a pleasant bath every day for free.
        Raising Pigs and Fish Improves Lives
    Salt fields are all located by the sea, and the supply of non-staple foods is somewhat difficult. In order to ensure that salt workers eat well, the Liaoning Piziwo Chemical Factory (producing chemical products and crude salt) arranges frail and elderly workers to the sideline team to expand sideline operations. They raise pigs, raise fish, grind tofu, and grow vegetables to ensure the supply of non-staple foods to the salt field.
    This year, the sideline team of this factory raised 300 pigs and caught more than 10,000 jin of fish. Now, it has been able to supply one jin of cabbage and half a jin of radish per person per day, and one jin of tofu can be eaten every three to five days.
    Next year, the sideline team of this factory also plans to raise 10,000 chickens and ducks, 20 dairy cows, 500,000 jin of fish, and 1,000 pigs, so as to basically achieve self-sufficiency in non-staple foods.

    关心盐工生活      
    献鞋
    江苏台南盐场建滩的民工，大多数是农村来的，远至丰县、沛县一带。他们不畏寒冷，日夜在泥水和草地里奋战。带来的鞋子都坏了。这件事情给台南盐场的职工知道了，全场马上掀起了一个献鞋袜热潮。12月4日下午，第六、第七工区组织学生百余人，携带鞋二千一百二十八双，棉帽二百七十顶，送到司令部。接着二工区职工又送来鞋十五双，袜子十五双。职工们说：“农民兄弟支援我们建滩，远离家乡，不畏艰苦，今天我们要表示一点心意。”傅林祥和周玉珍两个人亲自把棉袜送到司令部。送鞋送袜的消息传到各个连队，给全体建场民工带来很大鼓舞。  （陈朴）
        自建澡塘
    勤劳勇敢的盐工们一年到头要冒着夏天的炎热和冬天的严寒，不管风天和雨天都要坚持在露天生产。有时汗流浃背，有时弄得一身污泥和卤水。他们劳动一天以后，多么渴望着舒舒服服洗一个澡啊！汉沽盐场和其它兄弟盐场一样，一直在重视和设法解决这个问题，可是问题不能一下子全部解决。几年来，这个场所采取的措施是：一面着手修建澡塘；一面发洗澡票动员工人们到汉沽镇去洗澡，这样仅仅解决了一部分问题。随着盐场逐年发展，工人逐年增加，原来的洗澡塘就更显得不够用了。而且从盐场到汉沽镇，最近也有三、四里路，最远的有五十到六十里路。有的工人就是有澡票也很少有时间跑到镇上去洗澡。不久以前，汉沽盐场已经兴建了不少澡塘，一次可以容纳七十到八十人的澡塘就有三处。现在工人每天都可以免费洗一次愉快的澡。
        养猪又养鱼  生活得改善
    盐场都在海滨，副食品的供应有些困难。为了保证盐工吃得好，辽宁貔子窝化工厂（生产化工品和原盐）把体弱年老的工人安排到副业队来，扩大副业经营。他们养猪、养鱼、磨豆腐和种菜，保证盐场的副食品供应。
    今年，这个场的副业队养了三百头猪，捕鱼一万多斤。现在已做到每人每天供应一斤白菜和半斤萝卜，并且每隔三、五天可吃一斤豆腐。
    明年，这个厂的副业队，还准备养鸡鸭一万只，养奶牛二十头，养鱼五十万斤、猪一千头，做到基本上副食品自给自足。
