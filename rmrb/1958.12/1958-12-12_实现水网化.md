Connecting ditches, dams linked to dams,
Rivers flowing into rivers, sluice gates linked to sluice gates,
Rivers and ditches connected like a spiderweb,
From now on, the river water will listen to us;
Ordering it to go up the mountain, it climbs with a whoosh,
Ordering it to go down to the fields, it rushes down with a splash,
Thousand-year-old water disasters transformed into water conservancy,
Drylands achieving water network development.

    实现水网化
    沟通沟，坝连坝，
    河通河，闸连闸，
    河沟相连似蛛网，
    从今河水听俺话；
    叫上山，呼呼爬，
    叫下田，哗啦啦，
    千年水患变水利，
    旱地实现水网化。
