The control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union for 1959-1965 have been published. The main task put forward by this grand economic development plan is to comprehensively establish the material and technical basis of communism in a short period of seven years, further strengthen the economic and defense capabilities of the Soviet Union, and at the same time increasingly fully meet the material and spiritual needs of the Soviet people; to achieve a decisive victory in the peaceful economic competition with the capitalist world. To this end, the total industrial output value in 1965 will increase by approximately 80% compared to 1958; the total agricultural output value will increase by approximately 70%. The hardworking, brave, and intelligent Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party, will surely victoriously complete this great historical task.

In line with the rapid rise of the national economy in seven years, the development of science and technology in the Soviet Union, the expansion of the research base network, and the training of scientific personnel will be further strengthened and improved on the basis of the existing huge scale and high level during the same period. According to the control figures for the seven-year development of the Soviet national economy and some other published materials, the Soviet seven-year science development plan roughly includes the following main contents:

In the next seven years, controlling thermonuclear reactions to ensure that mankind has an infinite source of power is one of the most important tasks of Soviet science. The design of huge optical and radio electronic instruments, as well as the use of cosmic rockets and artificial earth satellites for astronomical research, will be given great importance in the seven-year plan. In order to meet the requirements of industrial production for new materials, in addition to atomic physics, solid-state physics is also an important project in the development science plan. In short, the Soviet seven-year science development plan particularly emphasizes the leading role of physics in natural science: the advancement of science related to physics and the national economy depends on the smooth development of physics; the future prospects of technological progress are primarily determined by the various achievements of today's physics in major directions. The major aspects of Soviet nuclear physics, radio electronics, semiconductors, metal physics, optics, magnetism, low-temperature physics, and many other fields of physics have already been at the forefront of the world. The Soviet Union's communist construction in the next seven years will definitely greatly promote the development of Soviet physics.

One of the most recent tasks of the seven-year national economic construction plan is to complete the overall electrification of the Soviet Union. To this end, it is necessary to increase the national power equipment rate at a high speed, create the most favorable methods for transporting power, and study the problem of directly converting the chemical energy in fuel into electrical energy.

The establishment of the Soviet Union's magnificent communist material and technical foundation requires the wide application of electronic computers, which puts forward the requirements for the research of the basic principles of computing technology and the creation of new, faster electronic computers. Closely related to electronic computers is the comprehensive mechanization and automation of the production process; they are the main decisive means to ensure the further technological progress of the Soviet national economy.

In terms of chemistry, the most important task of the Soviet Union is to vigorously expand theoretical research to promote the design of new and improved technological processes and the manufacture of synthetic materials with properties that meet the needs of modern technology, such as super-hard alloys, artificial fibers, organic and inorganic synthetic polymers, and so on. Soviet scientists also need to expand the scope of research on rare elements and further develop radiochemistry.

In the past forty-one years, outstanding Soviet geological exploration workers have discovered a large number of underground mineral deposits to supply the needs of the Soviet socialist construction cause. In the next seven years, geological exploration work must also ensure the exploration of large reserves of oil, gas, ferrous and non-ferrous metals in favorable economic areas in order to create more favorable conditions for the Soviet communist construction cause.

The development of biology is a necessary theoretical prerequisite for improving the level of medical and agricultural science. With the continuous application of achievements in physics and chemistry in biology, the comprehensive significance of biology will be particularly increased. The basic task of Soviet medicine in the next seven years is to further improve the average life expectancy and working ability of the Soviet people. Soviet agricultural science during the same period will focus on increasing agricultural yields and livestock productivity, and comprehensively developing the natural resources of the biological world.

Soviet scientists, guided by Marxism-Leninism, attach particular importance to the study of philosophy. Soviet social scientists have specific tasks in the next seven years: they will further creatively develop social science to meet the needs of building communism, actively criticize modern revisionism and bourgeois ideology, reveal and summarize the laws of social development, and study the practice of socialist construction and the prospects and specific paths for the transition to communism.

In order to successfully solve the scientific tasks in the seven-year national economic development plan, the Soviet government is preparing to expand the network of scientific research institutions and equip them with the latest instruments and equipment. Three science towns will be built, especially in Novosibirsk (mainly physical and technical specialties), Irkutsk (chemical technology and geology specialties), and Pushchino near Moscow (integrated physical, chemical, and biological). In addition, the high-speed development of the scientific institutions of the Academies of Sciences of the various republics is guaranteed.

In the training of scientific personnel, the Soviet government will greatly improve and enhance the training system and methods, as well as the quality and quantity of personnel, in the next seven years. The current higher education system regulations will be brought closer to production and construction; universities and colleges will enroll more young people with life experience and who have undergone a certain period of practical work. In the higher education system, the role and significance of night schools and correspondence schools will continue to grow. From 1959 to 1965, the number of graduates from Soviet universities and colleges will reach 2.3 million, an increase of more than 40% compared to the past seven years. The number of engineers trained for industry, construction, transportation, and postal and telecommunications industries will increase by 90% compared to the past seven years; the number of agricultural experts trained will be 50% more; and the number of engineers in chemical technology, automation, computing technology, radio electronics, and other new technology sectors will greatly increase. Secondary specialized education that is close to production will be further developed. In the next seven years, secondary specialized schools will enroll four million students, including students who participate in learning without leaving production.

The successful implementation of the Soviet seven-year science development plan will greatly strengthen the material and technical foundation of communist construction. Communist society needs incredibly abundant means of production and means of life, and among them, a sufficient supply of motive power is of paramount importance. To this end, Soviet science attaches particular importance to the control of thermonuclear reactions. In fact, the Soviet cause of peaceful use of atomic energy has been in a leading position worldwide. The Soviet Union was the first to build an atomic energy power station, the world's largest 10 billion electron volt synchronous stable phase proton cyclotron, and the "Lenin" atomic energy icebreaker, and the first phase of the 600,000 kilowatt atomic energy power station with 100,000 kilowatts has also been completed this year. After thermonuclear reactions are mastered by advanced Soviet science, in the near future we can not only foresee that various machines have sufficient motive power, and that clothing, food, and housing can be provided as needed, but even in terms of transportation, it can also be fully supplied as needed; interstellar and cosmic navigation of mankind will soon become a reality. In the next seven years, in addition to paying attention to the peaceful use of atomic energy and thermonuclear reactions, the Soviet Union will also pay attention to the full utilization and research of general chemical energy, such as the exploitation of petroleum and gas and new technologies to directly convert the chemical energy in fuel into electrical energy.

Secondly, in the production and consumption undertakings of communist society, the supply of new materials and the strength of solid materials are key issues in scientific and technological research tasks. To this end, the Soviet seven-year science development plan specifically proposes the preparation of super-hard alloys, artificial fibers, organic and inorganic synthetic polymers, and the research on the strength of solids in solid-state physics. Indeed, the improvement of solid strength will definitely bring huge wealth to the country. According to the seven-year plan, the annual steel production of the Soviet Union will increase to 86 million to 91 million tons by 1965. If the research work on metal strength can simultaneously increase the strength of the same piece of steel by a factor of two during the seven years, then 91 million tons of new steel can exert the effect of 182 million tons of old steel. This is of paramount importance for the manufacture of various machines and devices.

Third, the Soviet Union places the development and promotion of new technologies in an extremely important position in the seven-year science development plan. Outstanding Soviet scientific and technical personnel have successfully manufactured intercontinental ballistic missiles and launched artificial earth satellites. The Soviet aviation industry is the most advanced in the world. The "Tu-114" turboprop aircraft manufactured at the end of 1957 is the passenger plane with the highest carrying capacity and the longest range in the world. In the next seven years, Soviet scientists and engineers will also manufacture faster computers and make industrial production reach a higher degree of automation. These series of advanced technological improvements in the Soviet Union are all aimed at further mastering the secrets of the universe and pushing the lives of the Soviet people to a higher level.

Fourth, our socialist countries have repeatedly emphasized that the ultimate goal of developing science is to fully promote the rise of the national economy and the increase of the cultural and material welfare of the broad masses of the people. In the material life of the people, the improvement of the average life expectancy, work efficiency, health, and nutrition of the people are also issues of great concern to the Soviet regime. To this end, the research task of Soviet biological science in the next seven years is to improve the level of medical and agricultural science to complete the above tasks as a fighting goal.

Our thousands of scientific and technological workers are welcoming the Soviet seven-year plan for the development of the national economy with incomparable joy and encouragement. Especially in today's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great leap forward in science and technology in our country, we are completely convinced from our own personal experience that in seven years, the great plan of our great ally for the further development of the national economy and science and technology will definitely be successfully completed.

Under the wise leadership of the great Soviet Communist Party, the heroic Soviet people have built a previously poor and backward agricultural country into the world's most powerful country with highly developed industry and agriculture, enlightened science, and brilliant culture in forty-one years. In these forty-one years, the Soviet people also spent nearly twenty years, huge amounts of wealth and manpower in suppressing the counter-revolutionary domestic war, repelling foreign interference, and resisting the patriotic war against the barbaric invasion of German fascism. Therefore, we can foresee that, coupled with seven years of peaceful construction, it will surely make Soviet industrial and agricultural production and science and technology leap forward, the people's living standards will be further improved, the national defense forces will be stronger, and the communist cause will be further developed and consolidated.

Under the leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party, our scientific workers formulated China's twelve-year science and technology long-term development plan in 1956. In the two years since the plan was formulated, the weak links in many scientific departments, such as atomic energy, semiconductors, radio electronics, and aerodynamics, have rapidly grown up due to the strong support of the Party and the government, the active efforts of the broad masses of scientific and technical personnel in our country, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. A year ago, the Chinese government sent a scientific and technological delegation to the Soviet Union to sign the science and technology cooperation agreement between the two countries and 122 scientific and technological cooperation research projects with our great ally. This provides a strong guarantee for the smooth implementation of China's twelve-year science and technology long-term plan.

This spring, the Party issued the great call for the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, thereby launching a great leap forward in industry, agriculture, and science and technology throughout the country. The great leap forward in science and technology, especially the great leap forward in cutting-edge science and technology, makes our twelve-year science and technology development plan, on the whole, can be completed five years ahead of schedule; a considerable part can be completed seven years ahead of schedule, and some have already been completed. How exciting this is!

The reason why China's science and technology can leap forward at a speed of one day equals twenty years is because our science and technology workers, like the Soviet science and technology personnel, also have the leadership of the Party and also have the grand goal of building a socialist and communist society.

The numerous industrial and agricultural laborers and scientific and technical personnel of our two great countries will contribute infinite strength and wisdom to the development of science and technology in our two countries. The science and technology of the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism is on the decline. This is because the vast majority of American scientific workers are directly serving the scientific research and the profits of monopoly capitalists in preparation for the US imperialism to carry out aggressive wars.

The publication of the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union vividly illustrates the superiority of the socialist system. This seven-year economic development plan clearly points out to the people of the world that the road of socialism is a prosperous road, while the road of imperialism is a road of decline. We Chinese scientific workers should regard the advanced Soviet science that follows the path of the October Revolution as a brilliant example for us to always learn from, and under the strong leadership of the Party, develop our country's science and technology from the perspective of developing our country's productive forces, and make them rapidly catch up with and surpass the world's most advanced scientific level.

    先进的苏联科学是我们永远学习的光辉典范
    周培源
    苏联1959—1965年发展国民经济的控制数字发表了。这个宏伟的经济发展规划所提出的主要任务，是要在短短的七年内全面地建立共产主义的物质技术基础，进一步加强苏联的经济力量和国防力量，同时日益充分地满足苏联人民的物质和精神需要；要在同资本主义世界的和平经济竞赛中取得决定性的胜利。为此，1965年的工业总产值将要比1958年增加约80％；农业总产值约将增加70％。勤劳、勇敢、聪明的苏联人民，在伟大的苏联共产党领导下，一定会胜利地完成这个伟大的历史任务。
    和国民经济在七年内的迅速高涨相适应，苏联科学技术的发展，研究基地网的扩建和科学干部的培养，将在同一时期内，在原有的巨大规模和高度水平的基础上进一步加强和提高。按照七年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字和其它一些已发表的材料看来，苏联七年科学发展规划大致包括如下的一些主要内容：
    在今后七年中，控制热核反应，以便保证人类有无限动力的源泉，是苏联科学最重要任务之一。设计巨大的光学和无线电电子学仪器，以及利用宇宙火箭和人造地球卫星来进行天文学研究的新方法，将在七年计划中受到很大的重视。为了满足工业生产对新材料的要求，除了原子物理学以外，固体物理学在发展科学计划中也是一个重要项目。总之，苏联七年科学发展计划特别强调物理学在自然科学中起主导地位的作用：和物理学相近的科学以及国民经济的向前推进，都以物理学的顺利发展为转移；今后技术进步的远景，首先决定于今天的物理学在主要方向上的各项成就。苏联的原子核物理、无线电电子学、半导体、金属物理、光学、磁学、低温物理等许多物理学的主要方面，已居于全世界的最前列。今后七年的苏联共产主义建设将肯定地大大促进苏联物理学的发展。
    七年国民经济建设计划最近任务之一是要完成苏联全国的全盘电气化。为此，必须高速度地提高全国的动力装备率，创造最有利的输送动力的方法并研究把燃料中的化学能直接变为电能的问题。
    苏联宏伟的共产主义物质技术基础的建立，需要电子计算机的广泛应用，从而提出了对计算技术基本原理的研究和新型的、速度更高的电子计算机创造的要求。与电子计算机有密切关系的是生产过程的综合机械化和自动化；它们是保证苏联国民经济进一步技术进步主要决定性手段。
    在化学方面，苏联最重要的任务是，大力扩大理论研究，以促进新的、完善的工艺过程设计和制造具有满足现代技术需要性能的合成材料，如超硬质合金、人造纤维、有机和无机合成聚合物等等。苏联科学家还要扩大研究稀有元素的范围并且进一步发展放射化学。
    在过去的四十一年中，优秀的苏联地质勘探工作者已发现了大量的地下矿藏，供给苏联社会主义建设事业的需要。在今后的七年中，地质勘探工作还须保证在有利的经济区域勘探出大量的石油、煤气、黑色和有色金属的储藏，以便为苏联共产主义的建设事业创造更优越的条件。
    生物学的发展，是提高医学和农业科学水平所必需的理论前提。随着物理学和化学的成就在生物学中的不断应用，生物学的综合意义将会特别增长起来。苏联医学今后七年的基本任务是进一步提高苏联人民的平均寿命和工作能力。苏联的农业科学在同期内则在于提高农业的收成和畜牧业的产品率，并综合开发生物界的天然资源。
    以马克思列宁主义作指导思想的苏联科学家们特别重视哲学的学习。苏联社会科学家们在未来的七年中有特定的任务：他们将为满足建设共产主义的需要进一步创造性地发展社会科学，积极地批判现代修正主义和资产阶级思想意识，揭示和总结社会发展规律，并研究社会主义建设实践和向共产主义过渡的前景与具体道路的问题。
    为了顺利地解决七年国民经济发展计划中的科学任务，苏联政府准备扩大科学研究机构网，并用最新的仪器设备予以装备。特别在新西伯利亚城（主要是物理技术专业）、伊尔库次克（化学工艺和地质专业）和莫斯科附近的普希诺（综合物理化学生物学）建设三个科学镇。此外，并且保证各加盟共和国科学院科学机构的高速度发展。
    在科学干部的培养工作上，苏联政府将在今后七年中把培养制度和方法以及干部的质量和数量大为改进和提高。把现行的高等教育制度规定同生产建设更为接近；高等学校将招收更多的具有生活经验并曾经过一定的实际工作期限的青年。在高等教育的制度中，夜校和函授学校的作用和意义将不断增长。在1959—1965年内，苏联高等学校毕业生将达到二百三十万人，这比过去的七年将增长40％以上。为工业、建筑业、运输业和邮电业所培养的工程师将比过去七年增加90％；所培养的农业专家将多出50％；在化学技术、自动化、计算技术、无线电电子学和其他新技术部门专业中的工程师将会大大增加。与生产相接近的中等专门教育将获得进一步的发展。今后七年内，中等专门学校将招收四百万名学生，其中包括不脱离生产参加学习的学生在内。
    苏联七年科学发展规划的胜利实现，将大大加强共产主义建设的物质技术基础。共产主义社会需要有无比丰富的生产资料与生活资料，而其中充分的原动力的供应则居首要的地位。为此苏联科学特别重视热核反应的控制。事实上苏联原子能的和平利用事业已在世界范围内居领先的地位。苏联首先建成原子能发电站、世界上最大的一百亿电子伏特同步稳相质子回旋加速器和“列宁号”原子能破冰船，而六十万瓩原子能发电站的第一期十万瓩的工程又已在今年竣工。在热核反应被先进的苏联科学掌握之后，在不久的将来我们不仅可预见到各种机械有充分的原动力，衣、食、住可各予所需，即使在行的方面也可以按需要充分供应；人类的星际和宇宙航行也将很快成为现实。在未来的七年中，苏联除了重视原子能的和平利用和热核反应以外，同时也注意到一般化学能的充分利用和研究，如石油及煤气的开采和如何把燃料中的化学能直接变为电能的新技术。
    其次，在共产主义社会的生产和消费事业中，新的材料供应和固体材料的强度都是科学技术研究任务中的关键性问题。为此，苏联七年科学发展计划，特别提出如超硬质合金、人造纤维、有机和无机合成聚合物的制备及固体物理学中固体强度的研究。诚然，固体强度的改进一定会给国家带来巨大的财富。按照七年计划，苏联到1965年钢的年产量将增加到八千六百万到九千一百万吨。如果七年间金属强度的研究工作能够同时把同样一块钢材的强度增加一倍，则九千一百万吨的新钢材就可以发挥一亿八千二百万吨旧钢材的作用。这对各种机械和器件的制造具有头等重要的意义。
  第三，苏联把新技术的发展与推广放在七年科学发展计划中极重要的地位。优秀的苏联科学技术人员成功地制造了洲际弹道导弹和发射了人造地球卫星。苏联的航空事业是全世界最先进的航空事业，1957年底所制成的“图—114”涡轮螺旋桨飞机是世界上载重量最高、航程最远的旅客机。在今后七年中，苏联科学家和工程师们还将制造更高速度的计算机，并使工业生产达到更高程度自动化。苏联这一系列的先进技术改进措施，都是为了进一步掌握宇宙的秘密并把苏联人民的生活推向更高的水平。
    第四，我们社会主义国家一再强调：发展科学的最终目的在于全力促进国家经济的高涨与广大人民群众的文化和物质福利的增长。在人民的物质生活中，人民的平均寿命、工作效力、健康和营养的提高也都是苏维埃政权极关心的问题。为此，苏联生物科学在未来七年中的研究任务是，提高医学和农业科学的水平以完成上述任务作为奋斗目标。
    我国千千万万的科学技术工作者，以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接苏联发展国民经济七年计划。特别在我国工、农业生产大跃进和科学技术大跃进的今天，我们从自己亲身的经验中完全相信，在七年后，我们伟大的盟邦的进一步发展国民经济和科学技术的伟大计划，一定能够胜利完成。
    英雄的苏联人民在伟大的苏联共产党的英明领导下，已在四十一年内把一个原来贫穷落后的农业国建设成为工农业高度发达、科学昌明和文化灿烂的、世界最强大的国家。而在这四十一年中，苏联人民还把将近二十年的时间、巨大的财富和人力花在镇压反革命的国内战争、击退外国干涉和反抗德国法西斯野蛮侵略的卫国战争上。因此我们可以预见到，再加上七年的和平建设，一定会使苏联工、农业生产和科学技术飞跃发展，人民生活水平更加提高，国防力量更为强大和共产主义事业进一步发展与巩固。
    我国科学工作者在中国共产党的领导和关怀下，在1956年制订了我国十二年科学技术远景发展规划。在规划制订后的两年多时间里，许多科学部门的薄弱环节如原子能、半导体、无线电电子学、空气动力学等学科，由于党和政府的大力支持，我国广大科学技术人员的积极努力和苏联的无私帮助，已迅速地成长起来。一年以前，我国政府又派遣访苏科学技术代表团到莫斯科，和我们伟大的盟邦签订两国科学技术合作协定，以及一百二十二项科学技术合作研究项目。这使我国十二年科学技术远景规划的顺利执行得到强有力的保证。
    今年春天，党又发出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大号召，从而在全国范围内掀起了工、农业和科学技术的大跃进。科学技术的大跃进，特别是在尖端科学技术方面的大跃进，使我们十二年科学技术发展规划，总的说来可以提前五年完成；有相当一部分可以提前七年完成，其中有一部分则已经完成了。这是令人多么兴奋的事！
    我国的科学技术之所以能以一天等于二十年的速度向前跃进，这是因为我们科学技术工作者和苏联的科学技术人员一样，同样有党的领导，并同样具有建设社会主义和共产主义社会的宏伟目标。
    我们两个伟大国家的众多的工、农劳动者和科学技术人员，将为我们两国科学技术的发展贡献出无穷的力量和智慧。而以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的科学技术则正在走下坡路。这是因为绝大多数的美国科学工作者是直接为美帝国主义准备进行侵略战争的科学研究和垄断资本家的利润服务的。
    苏联发展国民经济的控制数字的发表，生动地说明了社会主义制度的优越性。这个七年经济发展计划鲜明地向全世界人民指出了社会主义的道路是欣欣向荣的道路，而帝国主义的道路是日暮途穷的道路。我们中国科学工作者更应当把走十月革命道路的先进的苏联科学作为我们永远学习的光辉典范，并在党的坚强领导下，从发展我国生产力的角度来发展我国的科学技术，并使它们迅速赶上并超过世界最先进的科学水平。
