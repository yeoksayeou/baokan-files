　　Congratulations to the Heroes Who Conquer the Sea
　　On the eve of the New Year, good news came from the Bohai Sea: the magnificent Hai River Sluice Construction Project was completed ahead of schedule! From now on, this ancient river has entered a new historical period and began to serve socialist construction obediently. Let us express our warm congratulations to all comrades who created this achievement!
　　The early completion of the Hai River Sluice Construction Project is a major victory for the people of Tianjin in understanding and applying objective laws to transform nature under the leadership of the Party; it is also the result of the combination of scientific analysis, meticulous organization, and soaring enthusiasm. Before this sluice construction, the relevant departments of Tianjin City had carefully analyzed subjective and objective conditions, proposed nine plans for comparison, and selected the most economical and reasonable plan. During the construction period, they meticulously organized the supply, allocation, and transportation of materials and labor. While emphasizing hard work, they emphasized practical work and clever work, mobilized the masses, and carried out technical revolution on a large scale. In the past five months, the people participating in the sluice construction put forward more than 430,000 innovation suggestions. These specific and meticulous tasks, combined with the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses, formed an invincible force, ensuring the early completion of the sluice construction project.
　　The Hai River Sluice Construction Project is only a key project in the entire plan to thoroughly harness the Hai River. Completely harnessing the Hai River is still a rather arduous task. At present, the people of Hebei Province are fighting heroically to change the face of the Hai River. We wish them greater victories!

    向驯海英雄们祝贺
    新年前夕，渤海之滨传来了好消息：规模宏伟的海河建闸工程提前竣工了！从此，这条古老的河道进入了新的历史时期，开始驯服地为社会主义建设服务。让我们向创造这一成就的全体同志表示热烈的祝贺！
    海河建闸工程提前竣工，是天津市人民在党的领导下认识、运用客观法则改造自然的一个重大胜利；也是科学分析、细致的组织工作和冲天的干劲相结合的结果。这次建闸以前，天津市的有关部门曾详细分析了主观和客观条件，提出了九个方案加以比较，选择了最经济合理的方案。在施工期间，又细致地组织了材料、劳动力、运输力的供应、调配工作。在提出苦干的同时，强调实干、巧干，发动群众，大搞技术革命。五个多月来，参加建闸的人提出了四十三万多件革新建议。这些具体的、细致的工作，和广大群众的冲天干劲相结合，就形成了无往不胜的力量，保证了建闸工程提前完工。
    海河建闸工程还只是整个根治海河计划中的一个枢纽工程。全部根治海河，仍然是一个相当艰巨的任务。目前河北全省人民正为改变海河面貌而英勇奋战，预祝他们取得更大的胜利！
