　　The Gaoligong Mountains and the Biluo Snow Mountains are already covered in white snow. Winter has arrived in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province.

　　Winter used to be a time of hunger and cold for the ethnic minorities on both sides of the Nu River. Before liberation, more than 80% of the poor farmers had already eaten the grain they harvested each year by this time, and began to rely on collecting wild vegetables, grass roots, and tree bark to survive. At that time, many tragic things happened in winter. Some people sold their own children for the price of a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of grain. Some people ate grass roots and tree bark but couldn't defecate, and bloated to death. Others were forced to leave their homes and flee to other places to escape famine. The history of the Lisu people is a history of starvation written in blood and tears! This winter, the reporter visited the Nujiang River Valley and saw no sign of hunger. The Lisu people's history of starvation has been completely ended by this year's unprecedented bumper harvest of grain. The total grain output of the prefecture this year has increased threefold compared to last year, and more than sevenfold compared to the year of liberation, averaging more than 1,600 jin (800kg) of grain per person. Now, people no longer worry about lack of grain, but worry about the sudden increase in grain and not knowing how to dispose of it. The Lisu people had no warehouses in the past. This year, every household emptied all the wooden and bamboo baskets to store grain. When they were full, they used public housing to pile up grain, but it was still not enough. Some villages had to build warehouses temporarily. Many places harvested rice for the first time this year and didn't even know how to eat it at first. In the past, the Lisu people used foot-operated pestles to hull grain for eating. One person could hull at most one斗 (dǒu) of grain from morning to night. Now that there is more grain, they eat it every meal, and they feel that the foot-operated pestle is not enough to meet the needs.

　　After leading the people of all ethnic groups to obtain a bumper harvest of grain, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture's Party committees at all levels promptly taught and helped them learn to live a new life. The four county Party committees sent Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and outstanding cadres to the people's communes to manage living welfare. They also transferred a large number of Han cadres and cadres from other ethnic groups in the interior to the public canteens to serve as stewards and cooks, and to teach the Lisu and other ethnic groups how to cook. The secretaries of the CPC Nujiang Border Work Committee and the Party committees of various counties and communes all planted "life experimental fields." After the secretary of the Fugong County Party Committee went to the public canteen of the Shangpa Brigade of the Guoging First Commune to plant "experimental fields," he taught the Lisu cooks how to steam rice, stir-fry vegetables, and grind tofu. The whole prefecture also gathered hundreds of stonemasons and carpenters from the interior to use the water power of the thousands of tributaries of the Nu River to rush to build water mills, water grinders, and water pestles for the communes, to replace the outdated foot-operated pestles. When the public canteens were first established, many canteens had rice but no vegetables, and ate cornmeal every meal. Now, they can generally steam rice and make耙耙 (bā bā, a kind of corn cake), and many canteens have one dish and one soup per meal. They eat meat on average every half month or one month. Such a life may not be considered good in the interior, but for the people of all ethnic groups in Nujiang, it is a great happiness that they never dreamed of in the past. With surprise, they composed a folk song and sang:

　　"Eating doesn't cost money,
　　Our ancestors for three generations have never seen it.
　　Is this a dream?
　　Is this true?
　　Where is this happening?
　　It's in our commune.
　　The East is red,
　　Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　After the Lisu people had enough to eat, the Party committees at all levels in Nujiang began to worry about the problem of their winter clothes. For generations, the poor Lisu farmers had only a single thin hemp cloth garment to cover their bodies. Every winter, they had to light a fire in the house that never went out, squatting by the fire to get through the long winter. This year, the Party is determined to let the 120,000 ethnic minorities in Nujiang spend the winter warmly. After the autumn harvest, the Party immediately led the people of all ethnic groups to vigorously develop sideline production, requiring an average sideline income of 100 yuan per person before the end of the year to completely solve the clothing problem. The whole prefecture formed a sideline production army of tens of thousands of people, going to the Gaoligong Mountains and the Biluo Snow Mountains to dig valuable medicinal materials such as Coptis chinensis and Dioscorea bulbifera, and to pick lacquer seeds and acorns. A brigade of the Tuanjie Commune in Bijiang County exchanged the medicinal materials they collected in five days for the winter clothes that the whole team lacked. The Bijiang County Trading Company's inventory of more than 1,000 cotton clothes, woolen clothes, and more than 2,500 hemp cotton blankets has been sold out. Now, it has organized more than 1,000 people and 274 horses to rush to transport cotton clothes and blankets from the interior to supply them.

　　The north wind howls all day in the Nujiang River Valley, and snowflakes flutter in the Biluo Snow Mountains and the Gaoligong Mountains, but the Lisu people no longer stay by the fire to spend the winter. Now they put on thick cotton clothes and go to the high mountains to dig Coptis chinensis, build water conservancy projects, build roads, and make steel, opening the prelude to a greater leap forward in the Nujiang area next year.

    怒江之冬
    黄昌禄
    高黎贡山和碧罗雪山已经白雪皑皑，冬天来到了云南省怒江傈僳族自治州。
    冬天，本来是怒江两岸少数民族饥寒交迫的日子。解放前，80％以上的贫苦农民每年收获的粮食这时已经吃完，开始指靠采集野菜、草根和树皮度日。那时，许多悲惨的事情在冬天发生了。有人为了一斗粮食的代价，忍痛出卖了自己的亲生儿女。有人吃了草根树皮解不出大便，活活胀死。也有人被逼得离家背井，逃荒到异乡。傈僳族的历史，是一部用血泪写成的饿肚子的历史呵！今年冬天，记者访问了怒江河谷，看不见一点饥饿的影子，傈僳族饿肚子的历史已经被今年粮食空前大丰收而彻底地结束了。全州今年粮食总产量比去年增加了三倍，比解放那年增加了七倍多，平均每人已有一千六百多斤粮食。现在，人们不再为缺粮而发愁，而是愁着粮食突然多了，不会处置。傈僳族过去是没有仓库的，今年家家户户把所有木札子和竹箩箩都腾出来装粮食，装不完，又把公房用来堆粮食，还是堆不完，有些村子只好临时突击盖仓库。许多地方今年第一次收获到稻谷，开始竟不知道怎样个吃法。过去傈僳人都是用脚碓舂粮食吃，一人从早舂到晚，最多能舂出一斗粮食来，现在粮食多了餐餐要吃，才感觉脚碓太不能满足需要了。
    怒江傈僳族自治州各级党委在领导各族人民获得粮食大丰收以后，又及时教导和帮助他们学会过新的生活。四个县委都派了共产党员、共青团员和优秀干部到各人民公社去管理生活福利，还抽调了大批汉族和内地其它民族的干部到公共食堂去担任事务长和炊事员，向傈僳等族人民传授作饭菜的技术。中共怒江边工委和各县委、公社党委的书记都种了“生活试验田”。福贡县委书记到国庆第一公社上帕大队的公共食堂去种“试验田”后，教会了傈僳族炊事员蒸米饭、炒菜、磨豆腐等技术。全州还集中了上百名从内地来的石工和木工，利用怒江千百条支流的水力，为各公社赶修水碾、水磨和水碓，以代替过时的脚碓。初办公共食堂时，许多食堂还有饭没菜，顿顿吃玉米饭。现在普遍会蒸大米饭和用玉米作耙耙，许多食堂每餐有一菜一汤。平均半月或一月吃一次肉。这样生活，在内地也许并不算好，但对怒江各族人民来说，却是过去梦想不到的大幸福。他们用惊喜的心情，编了一首民歌唱道：
    “吃饭不要钱，
    祖宗三代没见过。
    这是在作梦？
    真有这事情。
    这事在何处？
    就在我们公社里。
    东方红通通，
    万岁毛泽东！”。
    当傈僳人吃饱饭以后，怒江各级党委又为他
  们过冬的衣服问题而操起
  心来。祖辈相传，傈僳族贫
  苦农民终年只有一件单薄
  的麻布衣裳遮身，每到冬
  天，只好在室里烧起一塘
  不灭的火，蹲在火塘旁边
  挨过漫长的严冬。今年，
  党决心要让怒江十二万少
  数民族人民都能温暖地度过冬天。在秋收结束后，
  党立即领导各族人民大力发展副业生产，要求在年
  底前平均每人副业收入一
  百元，彻底解决穿衣问题。
  全州组成了上万人的副业
  生产大军，到高黎贡山和碧罗雪山上去挖黄连、黄山药等贵重药材，和采摘漆子橡子等。碧江县团结公社一个大队在五天内采集的药材，便换回了全队所缺的冬衣。碧江县贸易公司库存的一千多件棉衣、绒衣和二千五百多条麻棉毯，已经销售一空，现在又组织一千多人和二百七十四匹马从内地赶运棉衣棉毯来供应。
    怒江河谷整天北风呼啸，碧罗雪山和高黎贡山上雪花纷飞，但是傈僳人不再守住火塘过冬了。现在他们穿上厚厚的棉衣，到高山上挖黄连、修水利、筑公路、炼钢铁，为明年怒江地区的更大跃进揭开序幕。（附图片）
