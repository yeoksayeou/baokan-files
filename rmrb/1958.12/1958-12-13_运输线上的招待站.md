Way Stations on Transportation Lines

	The harsh winter has arrived. In order to promptly resolve the food and lodging problems of the transportation army on the iron and steel production front, the Communist Party of China's Hui County Committee convened a telephone conference of the Party Committee Secretaries of various People's Communes, deciding to establish labor people's way stations on various iron and steel transportation routes and other major economic lines to ensure that transportation personnel have housing, and vehicles and livestock have stables, achieving good food and good sleep for people, and good feed and rest for livestock.

	At present, twenty-seven labor people's way stations have been established on the county's four iron and steel transportation routes and three other economic lines.

    运输线上的招待站
    严寒的冬季到了。为了及时解决钢铁生产战线上运输大军中途的食宿问题，中共辉县县委会召开各人民公社党委书记电话会议，决定在各个钢铁运输道路和其它主要经济干线上，设立劳动人民招待站，保证运输人员有房住，车辆牲畜有马棚，达到人吃好、睡好，牲畜喂好、休息好。
    目前，全县四条钢铁运输道路和其它三条经济干线，已建立起二十七个劳动人民招待站。
