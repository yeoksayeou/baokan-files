    Nanxiong·Ganxian: Surpass Each Other, Help Each Other
    Advance Together in Competition
    (Our newspaper reports) Nanxiong County in Guangdong Province and Gan County in Jiangxi Province, in the late-season grain production competition, promoted communist spirit, learning from each other, and supporting each other. As a result, both counties shed the label of low-yield areas in red soil regions, and the late rice harvest was bountiful. Nanxiong County achieved a yield of 1,558 jin per mu, an increase of more than six times compared to the late rice crop last year; Gan County achieved a yield of 1,480 jin per mu, an increase of four and a half times compared to the late rice crop last year.
    During the competition, both sides openly shared their "strategies" and "tactics" with their competitors without reservation. Both sides exchanged all relevant production documents that were reported upwards and disseminated downwards. They sent "ambassadors" to reside in each other's areas to exchange information, and also organized several visiting delegations to visit each other. Both sides ensured that the masses knew the other side's production targets and production measures, progress, enthusiasm, and crop growth at each stage, and used this as motivation to launch mass debates on how to surpass the opponent, and to encourage the masses to move forward.
    Both counties regarded their competitors as their best learning models, and both put forward the slogan "Borrow the east wind, strive for the upstream." The "ambassadors" of both counties participated in all production-related meetings held by the other county's Party committee, and followed the other county's Party secretary or work team to inspect work at the grassroots level. Every few days, the "ambassador" would report the observed situation and advanced measures to their own county Party committee. The county Party committee, on the one hand, studied the important materials reported by the "ambassador" and adopted countermeasures; on the other hand, it issued circulars to grassroots leaders, so that they could frequently borrow the "east wind" from their competitors from top to bottom. The role of the visiting delegations was even greater. The visiting delegations not only "borrowed the east wind" from their competitors, but also brought the "east wind" to their competitors. After transplanting, the Nanxiong County visiting delegation first came to Gan County. They saw that Gan County's seedlings were growing stronger than their own because the leadership did a good job of focusing on key areas while taking care of all aspects, and the field management had good experience in irrigation and drainage. At that time, the People's Commune, which was first established in the key areas, also showed the superiority of the militarization of labor organization. They immediately mobilized the masses to work hard when they returned. And when the visiting delegation was about to leave, the person in charge of the visiting delegation—the secretary of the Nanxiong County Party Committee, at the invitation of the host, gave a radio speech to the people of Gan County. In his speech, the guest claimed that the visiting delegation had come to learn from the people of Gan County; and said: You must not be negligent at all, otherwise we will definitely surpass you. This greatly encouraged the opponent's determination and enthusiasm to strive for the upstream. Since then, the exchange of visiting delegations between the two sides has also been like this, learning from each other and promoting each other. Nanxiong County successively put forward the slogans "Attack the tillering barrier" and "Attack the ear number and grain number barrier" in field management. The slogans were clear, the measures were specific, and the effects were significant. After the Gan County visiting delegation observed and returned, they also promptly mobilized the masses to follow suit. The Gan County visiting delegation also saw that Nanxiong County had set up many sweet potato experimental fields with yields of tens of thousands of jin to one million jin per mu—"Sweet Potato Mountain" (three-dimensional planting method), and also brought this advanced measure back to implement. The Nanxiong County visiting delegation also learned advanced experience in manufacturing local fertilizer and advanced measures in accumulating fertilizer in Gan County. Later, when Gan County vigorously grasped steel production, it once relaxed late-stage field management, and the work of eliminating third-class seedlings was not thorough enough. But after the visiting delegation returned from Nanxiong County, they broke the superstitious belief that "rice seedlings do not eat White Dew fertilizer" that the masses and cadres originally held, and learned from the opponent's practice of applying strong topdressing fertilizer to catch up.
    The two counties have established a deep revolutionary friendship through competition. Whether the Nanxiong County visiting delegation came to Gan County, or the Gan County visiting delegation came to Nanxiong County, they were warmly and kindly welcomed everywhere. The masses and cadres treated the competition opponent's visit like they treated their own relatives, requesting them to inspect production work and provide guidance. Therefore, while humbly learning the good things from their competitors, the visiting delegations also sincerely offered opinions when they saw that their competitors were not doing well enough. In addition, the two counties also supported each other materially. Gan County supported Nanxiong County with high-quality green manure seeds, and Nanxiong County also supported Gan County with tobacco stalks, which have a good insecticidal effect. At present, both parties are still negotiating the exchange of improved varieties needed for early rice and late rice production next year.
    Recently, the competition came to an end. Representatives from both sides participated in the opponent's celebration of the bumper harvest, once again exchanged red flags, and proposed to continue the competition. (Yang Weiqun)

### 南雄·赣县  超过对方  帮助对方  竞赛中共同跃进

    南雄·赣县  超过对方  帮助对方
    竞赛中共同跃进
    本报讯  广东省南雄县、江西省赣县在晚造粮食生产竞赛中发扬了共产主义思想，互相学习，互相支援。结果，两个县都摘掉了红土壤地区低产的帽子，晚稻获得了大丰收。南雄县亩产一千五百五十八斤，比去年晚造增产六倍多；赣县亩产一千四百八十斤，比去年晚造增产四倍半。
    这两个县在竞赛过程中，双方都对竞赛对手毫无保留地公开自己的“战略”“战术”。双方互相交换所有上报下达的有关生产的文件。互相派遣“大使”常驻在对方通情报，而且几次组织参观团互相参观，双方都做到让群众知道对方的生产指标和每个时期的生产措施、进度、干劲及庄稼生长情况，并以此为动力发动群众辩论如何超过对手，鼓舞群众前进。
    两个县都把竞赛对手当作自己最好的学习榜样，都提出了“借东风，争上游”的口号。两县的“大使”参加对方县委召开的所有有关生产的会议，并跟着对方县委书记或工作组到下面去检查工作。每隔几天，“大使”就把观察到的情况和先进的措施向自己的县委反映。县委一方面把“大使”反映来的重要材料加以研究，采取对策；一方面印发通报给基层的领导，使自上而下经常从竞赛对手借到“东风”。至于参观团起的作用可就更大了。参观团不仅向对手“借东风”，同时也把“东风”带给对手。插秧后，南雄县参观团首先来到赣县，他们见到赣县的禾苗生势比自己的强，是由于领导把重点带全面搞得好，田间管理在排灌方面也有好经验；当时在重点区首先建立起来的人民公社，劳动组织军事化也显示了优越性。他们回去马上发动群众大干特干起来。而当参观团临走的时候，参观团的负责同志——南雄县委书记应主人的邀请向赣县人民作了广播讲演。客人在讲演中声称参观团是来向赣县人民学习的；并且说：你们可千万不要有点儿疏忽，否则我们一定超过你们。这也就大大鼓舞了对手力争上游的决心和干劲。此后，双方参观团的来往也都这样互相学习，互相促进。南雄县在田间管理方面先后提出“攻分蘖关”、“攻穗数粒数关”，口号很明确，措施很具体，效果很显著。赣县的参观团观摩回去后，也及时发动群众照着办。赣县的参观团还看见了南雄县搞起许多亩产几十万斤到一百万斤的番薯试验田——“番薯山”（立体种植法），也把这个先进措施带回去实行。南雄县的参观团也还在赣县学习了制造土化肥的先进经验和积肥方面的先进措施。后来，赣县在大力抓钢铁生产时曾一度放松后期田间管理，消灭三类禾的工作做得不够彻底。但当参观团到南雄县回来之后，就打破了群众和干部中原来认为季节已过“禾苗不吃白露肥”的迷信思想，学习对手的追施壮尾肥的做法，迎头赶上去。
    这两个县通过竞赛建立了深厚的革命友谊。不论南雄县的参观团来到赣县，或是赣县的参观团来到南雄县，他们到处受到热烈而亲切的欢迎。群众和干部对待竞赛对手的参观，像对待自己的亲人一般，请求他们检查生产工作和给予指导。因此，参观团在虚心地学习竞赛对手的好东西的同时，见到竞赛对手有做得不够的地方也诚恳地提出意见。此外，两个县还从物质上互相支援，赣县以上等的绿肥种子支援南雄县，南雄县也以杀虫效很好的烟梗支援赣县。目前，双方还在协商交换明年早稻、晚稻生产所需的良种。
    最近，竞赛告一段落，双方各派代表参加对手的庆丰收大会，再次互送了红旗，并且提出要把竞赛继续下去。  （杨伟群）
