    Niangniangmiao Commune Establishes Seed Bank
    According to a report in the Liaoning Daily, the Niangniangmiao People's Commune in Jianchang County, Liaoning, has comprehensively arranged labor, organizing elderly laborers and weaker women to carefully select fine seeds. In order to select good seeds, the Niangniangmiao Commune established a standardized fine seed selection experimental point in Xiadian Village, Second Brigade. Large-grained seeds were selected grain by grain, and small-grained seeds were screened and winnowed to remove discolored and pest-damaged grains. This village also established a separate seed bank, with all kinds of seeds labeled and properly stored. Each work area in the commune has also carried out seed selection and retention work, establishing ninety-four seed banks.

    娘娘庙公社建立种子库
    据辽宁日报消息  辽宁建昌县娘娘庙人民公社全面安排了劳力，组织年老的劳力和体格较弱的妇女精选良种。娘娘庙公社为了选好种子，在第二大队下店屯，搞了个标准化的精选良种试验点，大粒种子做到粒选，小粒种子做到了筛选和风选，除掉了杂色和病虫粒。这个屯还单独建立了种子库，各种种子都挂名标签，妥善保管。这个公社的各作业区也都开展了选种留种工作，建立了种子库九十四个。
