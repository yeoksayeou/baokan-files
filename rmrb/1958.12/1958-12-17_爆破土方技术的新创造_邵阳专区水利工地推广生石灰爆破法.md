    New Creation in Earthwork Blasting Technology
    Shaoyang Prefecture Water Conservancy Construction Site Promotes Quicklime Blasting Method
    (Our report) In the midst of the winter water conservancy construction campaign, Shaoyang Prefecture in Hunan Province is vigorously promoting the quicklime blasting method for earth extraction. More than half of the seven hundred large and medium-sized reservoirs currently under construction in the region have conducted successful trials. Longhui County, which first created this method, has adopted quicklime blasting for all twenty-four large and medium-sized reservoirs under construction, with the largest single blast yielding 1,050 cubic meters of earth.
    The quicklime blasting method for earth extraction is a bold creation by Zhang Yifa, a water conservancy cadre from Longhui County. While he was responsible for construction at the Shuikoushan Reservoir in Gaoping Commune, he noticed that railcars full of quicklime were fine before it rained, but would crack after the rain. This phenomenon caught his attention. He thought, if this expansive force could be used to blast earth, wouldn't the problem of a lack of explosives be solved? The more he thought about it, the more sense it made, so he asked a few commune members to start digging blast holes and loading them with quicklime. The result was 30 cubic meters of earth blasted. Through summarization and improvement, the earth-blasting effect quickly increased to more than 1,000 cubic meters per blast. Now the method has been widely promoted throughout the region, and they are moving towards higher efficiency of several thousand or ten thousand cubic meters per blast.
    The quicklime blasting method is a major innovation in water conservancy construction technology, and it is of great significance for ensuring the completion of this winter's water conservancy tasks. Shaoyang Prefecture requires the realization of water conservancy this winter and next spring to create conditions for a greater leap forward next year. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor, various construction sites are striving for semi-mechanized construction and have already achieved great results. However, due to the lack of explosives, large-scale blasting for earth and stone extraction cannot be fully promoted, and an incompatibility contradiction has emerged between semi-mechanized ramming and manual earth extraction processes. The success of quicklime blasting has precisely solved this contradiction.
    According to reports from various locations, the quicklime blasting method is very popular among the masses because: 1. Materials are obtained locally. Every construction site can burn lime, and after blasting it can be used as a component of "three-in-one" soil. It doesn't lose anything. 2. High efficiency. According to calculations at the Longhui Shuikoushan construction site, three workers can extract more than 390 cubic meters of earth, averaging more than 130 cubic meters per worker, increasing efficiency by 25 times compared to manual earth extraction. 3. Simple technical operation. Every civilian worker understands it at a glance, and both large and small construction sites can adopt it. 4. Safe. There is no explosive sound, and no soil or rocks flying around, ensuring no accidents. (Qian Songmao)

### 爆破土方技术的新创造  邵阳专区水利工地推广生石灰爆破法

    爆破土方技术的新创造
    邵阳专区水利工地推广生石灰爆破法
    本报讯  在开展水利冬修运动中，湖南邵阳专区正在大力推广生石灰爆破取土法，现在全区已开工的七百多座大、中型水库，已有半数以上的工程做了试验，都很成功。首先创造这个方法的隆回县动工的二十四座大、中型水库，全部采用了生石灰爆破土方，最高一炮炸土一千零五十方。
    生石灰爆破取土，是隆回县水利干部张贻发的大胆创造。他在高坪公社水口山水库负责施工的时候，看到工地上满载生石灰的土火车箱在下雨前都是好的，但是在下雨后却被涨裂缝。这个现象引起他很大的注意，他想，如果把这种膨胀力用来爆破土方，缺乏炸药的问题不就解决了吗。越想越有道理，便约了几个社员动手开挖炮眼，装上生石灰，结果炸土三十公方，通过总结提高，炸土效果很快就增加到每炮一千多方。现在全区已普遍推广，正在向每炮几千方、一万方的高工效迈进。
    生石灰爆破法是水利施工技术上的一大革新，它对保证今冬水利任务的完成有重大意义。邵阳专区今冬明春要求实现水利化，为明年更大跃进创造条件，为了克服劳力不足的困难，各个工地正在向半机械化施工努力，而且已经取得了很大的成绩，但是由于炸药的缺乏，大爆破取土采石无法全面推广，半机械化的夯运和手工取土的工序之间出现了不相适应的矛盾。石灰爆破的成功，恰好解决了这个矛盾。
    据各地反映，生石灰爆破法深受群众欢迎，这是因为：一、就地取材，石灰每个工地都能烧，爆破之后还可以用作三合泥，一两不蚀；二、工效高，据隆回水口山工地计算，三个工能取土三百九十余方，平均每工取土一百三十方，比人工取土提高工效二十五倍；三、技术操作简单，每个民工一看便知，并且大小工地都能采用；四、安全，没有爆炸声，没有土石横飞的现象，保证不出事故。   （钱松茂）
