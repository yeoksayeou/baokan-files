榆东渠 (Yú dōng qú) – A Typical Example of Diverting Water to Transform the Desert

Yulin County in Shaanxi Province is a sandy mountain area, with desert accounting for 60% of the total area. Whenever there is a strong wind, sand dunes appear on flat ground, and houses and courtyards are filled with sand. Cultivation is very difficult; one crop may have to be planted several times before seedlings emerge. Therefore, to survive here, people must compete with the desert for land, grain, and housing.

After liberation, the Party led the broad masses in a large-scale battle against desertification. Extensive tree planting and grass planting, creating windbreak forest belts along the edges of the desert, the "Green Great Wall" has been basically formed, creating conditions for fundamentally conquering the desert.

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, Yulin County launched an unprecedented upsurge in farmland water conservancy this spring. The "Yudong Canal" first set up the first red flag for the people of the county to march into the desert. This canal is 280 *li* long and is expected to irrigate 600,000 *mu* of desert and mountain land.

When construction began, there was no experience. Digging a small pit would cause the shifting sand from higher ground to flow into the pit. Sometimes a day's hard work digging a canal would be filled in overnight by the wind. After fighting for half a month, there were no results. After inspection and summarization, a new guiding principle of "opening canals while diverting water, using water to fix the sand, and using water to open canals" was found.

Boldly Break with Old Conventions
Determining the "Gradient" by Diverting Water

After a few days, nearly ten *li* of canals were opened using manual labor and water power. The new problem that emerged was how to determine the "gradient." According to the rules in general loess areas, a drop of one *chi* for every 2,000 to 3,000 meters of water flow is appropriate. In the great desert, no one knew what it should be. Some people advocated enlarging the "gradient" to less than 1/2000, reasoning that a larger "gradient" would make the water flow faster, less prone to leakage, and less prone to siltation. Others felt this was not good. To solve this problem, various "gradients" from 1/2000 to 1/7000 were constructed in sections on the newly opened ten *li* of canals, and then water was diverted for testing. The results were that in sections with a large "gradient," the banks of the canal were severely scoured, and large amounts of sand collapsed. In order to protect the dikes, hundreds of wooden stakes were driven and tens of thousands of *jin* of firewood were used to compress vegetation alongside the canal embankments that were only half a *li* long, but the dikes could still not be preserved. Where the "gradient" was smaller, neither wooden stakes nor firewood were needed, only a lot of water seepage (which was not bad), but the banks were solid. Who was right and who was wrong? The water provided the conclusion, proving that canal construction in the desert should minimize the "gradient" as much as possible in order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Attacking Sand with Water, Replenishing Sand with Sand

When the canal was dug about ten *li*, it encountered a large sand dune more than five *zhang* high and forty *zhang* long, blocking the way. "Sand fears water" is well known, so it was decided to attack with water. But attacking such a large sand dune was a first for everyone. Moreover, more than 30 households of the Yangjiahuochang lived at the foot of the large sand dune, and if something went wrong, there would be great danger. Everyone held the attitude of "be bold but careful" and made tense preparations before the canal water arrived. Everyone had a bundle of willow branches, and people relied on each other, branches connected to branches, to build a "human dike" on the west bank of the canal and above the village, so as to force the water to the east of the large sand dune's belly. After a day of intense preparation, the night attack on the sand dune began. On the cold sand dune, the soldiers fought hard for four days and nights to conquer the desert and ensure the safety of more than 30 households. Fifty thousand cubic meters of the large sand dune were sent to the southwest river bay, and a large canal more than ten *zhang* wide was opened in the center of the sand dune. Such a large workload would have required more than 10,000 workdays if water was not used, but now it was completed in less than 600.

When the canal water flowed further forward, it reached "阎王壁" (Yánwáng bì) – "The Wall of the King of Hell" – a large sand mountain more than four *zhang* high and more than twenty *zhang* wide. With the sand high and the water low, the sand mountain blocked the way like a Great Wall, so it was very difficult to attack. More than 150 iron men opened a gap on the top of the mountain. Even if the opening on the top was more than ten *zhang* wide, it would be a small ditch only one or two *zhang* wide by the time it reached the foot of the mountain. If they continued to dig, large amounts of shifting sand would collapse. So everyone contributed ideas, and the local engineers met four times. Liu Xiaogao from Gaojiahuochang suggested that when the two walls of the canal were about to collapse, wooden boards should be driven into the sand on both sides and supported in the middle with wooden sticks, and then wooden boards should be covered on top. The wooden boards would sink deeper and deeper, the shifting sand would no longer be harmful, and then they would dig from the middle. The "wooden board cave" was thus formed. The canal water flowed south through the water cave, and a large amount of sand also flowed south with the water. After two days and two nights of impact, the canal cave became larger and larger. Finally, a large gap more than ten *zhang* wide was opened in the middle of the "Wall of the King of Hell", allowing the canal water to smoothly enter the heart of the desert.

After passing through the "Wall of the King of Hell", there were sixteen consecutive large sand dunes. Here, not to mention that the tips of the sand ridges were like the bridge of a nose, making it very difficult to open a ditch, even if a canal was opened here, there was still a large sand bay several *zhang* deep to the west. During construction, water was still used to attack, but here the method used was not "diverting water to pull sand" to build dikes, but rather using the scouring force of the water to flush the sand ridges from the outside to the inside, layer by layer, into the sand bay, so that the sand ridges filled the sand bay. This is called "replenishing sand with sand". After a month and two days of hard struggle, a flat ditch fifteen to eighteen *zhang* wide was finally opened in the rapidly undulating and long six-*li* shifting sand bay, and the canal was opened on top of the ditch.

Small Fish Play in Shallow Grass
The Scene Catches Up with Jiangnan

The "Yudong Canal" stretches like a long dragon more than one hundred *li* into the heart of the desert.

Although it has not been long since water was diverted to irrigate the sand, the appearance of the desert has changed dramatically. In the sand bays around the canal embankments, small lakes are like strings of grapes, one after another, while the sand dunes are like isolated islands trapped in the center of the lakes. Surrounded by the lake water, the sand dunes gradually sink into the lakes. The desert wind is no longer harmful. The more it blows, the stronger it blows, the faster the sand dunes disappear, and the faster the lakes become level. In the past, no grass grew in the great desert, but now trees and wild grass are growing naturally along the canal and around the lakes. Although the canal water has only flowed for five months, the dense reeds and cattails have already grown more than three *chi* high, and very small fish have appeared in the deep lakes. It is conceivable that the desert, which was once barren, will soon be transformed into an oasis with the addition of tree planting and afforestation.

Currently, the weather is cold and freezing, and the warriors opening the canal are advancing victoriously, determined to bring the river water to the Qingquan mountainous area.

    长龙游进漠海
    榆东渠——引水改造沙漠的一个典型
    陕西榆林县是沙山地区，沙漠面积占总面积的60％。每遇大风，平地出现沙丘，房屋院落积满沙土。耕种十分困难，一料作物说不定要种几次才能见苗。所以住在这里的人们，要生活下去，必须和沙漠争地、争粮、争房。
    解放后，党领导广大群众进行了规模宏大的治沙斗争。大量的植树、种草，在沙漠边沿营造防沙林带，“绿长城”已基本形成，为从根本上征服沙漠创造了条件。
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，榆林县今年春季掀起了空前规模的农田水利高潮。“榆东渠”首先为全县人民向沙漠进军树起了第一面红旗。这条渠全长二百八十里，预计灌溉六十万亩沙漠和山滩地。
    施工开始，没有经验，挖下一个小坑，高处的流沙流进坑内，有时辛苦一天挖的渠道，一夜风吹，渠就填平了。一连战斗半月，全无成绩。经过检查总结，找到了“边开渠、边引水、以水固沙、用水开渠”引水进沙的新方针。
    大胆破陈规
    引水定“比降”
    经过几天，人工加水力就开渠近十里，接着出现的新问题是“比降”如何定。按照一般黄土地区规矩，水流二千至三千公尺降低一尺是适宜的。在大沙漠里，应该怎样谁也说不来。有人主张把“比降”放大到两千分之一以下，理由是“比降”放大水流的快，不容易渗漏，又不容易淤沙。又有人觉得这样不好。为了解决这一问题，就在刚开的十里渠道上，分段修成各种从二千分之一直至七千分之一的“比降”，然后引水检验。结果呢，“比降”大的地段，渠道两旁冲刷厉害，大批大批的落沙，为了护堤在仅仅半里的渠堰旁就打木桩数百根，压柴草万余斤，堤还是保不住。而“比降”愈小的地方，既不要木桩也不要柴草，唯渗水很多（这没有坏处），但堤岸牢靠。谁正确，谁错误，水给做了结论，证明沙漠修渠要尽可能的缩小“比降”，才能多快好省。
    以水攻沙  以沙补沙
    当渠挖了约十里左右，遇见五丈多高四十丈长的大沙丘挡住了去路。“沙怕水”这是人所共知的，所以决定用水攻。但攻这样的大沙丘对大伙说还是第一次，况且在大沙丘四脚下还住着杨家伙场的三十多户人家，万一有失，就有很大危险。大家抱着“胆要大、心要细”的态度，在渠水来到之前，进行了紧张的准备。每人一捆杨柳枝，人靠人、枝连枝，在渠的西堤、村子上边筑起了“人堤”，以便把水逼向大沙丘腹部的东边。经过一天紧张的准备，开始夜攻沙丘。在冷酷的沙丘上，战士们为了征服沙漠，为了三十多户人的安全，奋战四昼夜，五万方的大沙丘被送到了西南河湾里，在沙丘的中心冲开十多丈宽的大渠。这样大的工作量，如果不用水攻，需得一万多个工日，而现在还不到六百个就开成了。
    渠水再往前流就到了“阎王壁”——四丈多高，二十多丈宽的大沙山。沙高水低，沙山像长城一样挡住去路，所以攻起来很困难。一百五十多个铁汉在山顶开口，那怕上面开了十多丈宽，没到山脚下就剩一、二丈宽的小沟了。再继续挖，两旁的流沙就会大批大批流下来。于是人人献计，土工程师们四次集会，高家伙场刘小高建议当渠的两壁挖到快要下塌的时候，即把木板打进两旁的沙里，中间用木棒撑住，上边再盖好木板。木板越压越下陷，流沙不再为害，然后，再从中间挖，“木板洞”就这样形成。渠水穿过水洞南流，大量的沙子也随水南流。经过两天两夜的冲击，渠洞越冲越大，最后在“阎王壁”中间打开十多丈宽的大缺口，使渠水顺利的进入沙漠心脏。
    穿过“阎王壁”，紧接着又是一连十六个大沙丘。在这里，别说沙梁尖的像鼻梁一样，要开沟非常困难，就是这里算开出渠来，往西边却还有几丈深的大沙湾。施工时还是用水攻，不过这里采用的不是
  “引水拉沙”筑堤法，而是借用水的冲力，将沙梁由外到里一层一层地冲到沙湾，让沙梁填平沙湾。这叫“以沙补沙”。经过一月零两天的艰辛斗争，终于在起伏急剧长达六里的流沙湾里打开十五丈到十八丈宽的一条平坦的大沟，渠道就开在沟上面。
    小鱼戏浅草
    景象赶江南
    “榆东渠”像长龙一样弯弯曲曲地向沙漠心脏伸延了一百多华里。
    引水灌沙虽然没有多长时间，但沙漠的面貌已经发生了急剧的变化。在渠堤周围的沙湾里，小湖像葡萄串一样一个接着一个，沙丘却像孤岛被困在湖泊的中心。沙丘在湖水的包围下，逐渐陷落在湖里了。沙漠的风也不再为害了，愈刮的多，愈刮的大，沙丘愈消失的快，湖泊愈平的快。过去，大沙漠中是寸草不生，现在在渠道的旁边，在湖泊的周围，树木、野草自然的长了起来。虽然渠水仅仅流了五个月，而那些密密的芦草、蒲草，有的已经长了三尺多高；水很深的湖泊里，还出现了很小很小的鱼。可以想见，不久以前还是一片荒凉的沙漠，加上植树造林，很快就会变成绿洲了。
    目前天寒地冻，开渠的勇士们正在乘胜前进，一定要把河水引到清泉山区。
