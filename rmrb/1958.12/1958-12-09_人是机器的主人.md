Man is the Master of Machines
任平

Even the biggest jobs can be done
The Anshan Iron and Steel Works needed to process a large gear on a bearing ball cylinder, and dozens of units were unable to take on the task. This gear had a diameter of 3.8 meters, a large piece of work. One day, it arrived at the Harbin Machine United Factory. Initially, the comrades in the supply and marketing department also believed that they did not have a milling machine large enough and insisted that they could not accept this task. After hearing this, the workers said, "If large equipment isn't accepted here, and isn't accepted there, who will complete the country's tasks? If others won't take it, we will." With the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters, they accepted the task.

The factory assigned this task to Yu Jixian, a sixth-grade young worker. Completing this task required a five-foot spiral milling machine. They did not have this equipment. With the help of veteran workers Men Shoulou and Chen Zhen, they pondered again and again, put the gear on the frame, found the center, leveled it, and clamped it tightly. Then, they stood up a small machine tool, installed a vertical milling head, and clamped on a corn milling cutter. In this way, they assembled the first "building block" machine tool. The large part processing task was completed ahead of schedule. From then on, the workers said heroically: "We can process infinitely large things."

Don't underestimate these indigenous methods
This factory also had a little story when processing vacuum filter plates. When they accepted the task, their first calculation was that the filter plate needed to have 380,000 holes drilled. According to the design capacity of the entire factory at that time, they could barely complete the task. However, after the task entered the factory, they found that the calculation was wrong, it was 3.8 million holes. This was a tenfold increase. It was truly extraordinary. What to do? The Party branch held a special meeting to discuss the key issues of the filter plate. The factory director personally went deep into the masses to study and solve the problem, and mobilized the masses to contribute ideas. Veteran workers Song Zhendong and Yao Youguo proposed using waste materials to piece together a multi-head drilling machine to complete this task. This suggestion was supported by the Party organization in the workshop. In the manufacturing process, there were many difficulties. There were no drawings, no ready-made objects, and no technicians. In the words of Master Yao: "Precisely because we don't have them, that's why we are making them. We use a pair of hands and a caliper plus brainpower. The waste pile is an important source of our materials. If it doesn't work the first time, we'll do it again." The connecting rod for automatic feeding was modified seven or eight times, and other structures were also designed while being manufactured. The friction clutch on the pulley was made with reference to the bicycle brake. After a week of hard work, the first multi-axis automatic drilling machine was successfully manufactured. The key problem in production was solved. The task that originally required four years and three months to complete was now completed in only sixty days.

Both high speed and high precision are required
The leap forward targets are getting higher and higher, the work being done is getting bigger and bigger, and the required precision is also getting higher and higher. This situation forced them to think of ways. At this time, some people proposed adding new equipment, to "do big things in a big way, and precise things in a precise way." City model worker and veteran worker Wu Bingyu said: Our factory should be based on diligence and thrift, the enterprise has great potential, and we should dig it well, and not rush to buy new beds. Some workers also criticized: Why not look at the past, and not look at the favorable conditions? Under the guidance of such thinking, they began to attack high speed and high precision. The end face processing of the blower cover was originally done by turning, which was too low in productivity. It took sixteen hours to process one. The main difficulties were that it was not easy to clamp, positioning was difficult, high speed could not be achieved, and the accuracy could not be guaranteed due to the hole distance tolerance relationship. In order to solve this difficulty, veteran workers proposed using a double-axis boring machine to process the holes and using a vertical milling machine to process the end face and the hole circle. They used waste materials to piece together a building-block double-axis boring machine, and also used old materials and a car body rotating platform to assemble a building-block vertical rotary machine. Not only did this increase production efficiency tenfold, but it also completely guaranteed accuracy. After the trial production was successful, they proudly said: "We can process planes of any diameter." They happily sang: Not afraid of big jobs, not afraid of precise jobs, a move of the brain, better than gods.

Workers become multi-skilled
"Man is the master of machines, and must not let dead machines control living people." This is the personal experience of the workers of the Machine United Factory, and also their source of encouragement. Because they have such a belief, they mobilize the machines in ever-changing ways, and use them flexibly. Almost none of the machine tools in their factory now retain their original "foreign" appearance. Either something has been added here, or something has been removed there; either the body of that machine tool is pieced together on this machine tool, or the cutting head of this machine tool is pieced together on that machine tool. Small ones do big ones, and rough ones do precise ones. It is truly a variety of innovations. Some machine tools pieced together from discarded parts or old and broken machine tools look like a pile of scrap iron, but they are still producing wealth for the country there. After liberation, the workers politically turned themselves over and became the masters of the machines. Now they are technically turning themselves over, making revolution, and want to be the masters of the machines. The workers of the Machine United Factory are indeed like this. They do what they want, very freely. They created oval, polygonal, hole-in-hole, etc., turning that had never existed in the world.

Machines can be assembled at will, and people have also become multi-skilled. 80% of their technicians can master two to twelve technologies. A worker in the second workshop said: "Every worker in our workshop can operate the machine tools, there are no fixed people." The fourth workshop is in charge of assembly. When the second workshop is busy, they take the task over, modify the machine tools, piece together various "building blocks", turn them and rotate them. It is truly convenient. Look, how obedient the machines are to people! Their own conclusion is still correct: Machines are made by people, and must obey people's commands. Man is the master of machines.

    人是机器的主人
    任平
    再大的活也能干
    鞍钢要加工承球筒上的大齿轮，跑了几十个单位都没有人承担这项任务。这个齿轮直径有三点八公尺，是个大件活。一天，到了哈尔滨机联厂。开始，供销科的同志也认为没有那么大的铣床，坚持不能接受这一任务。工人听到以后，说：“大型设备，这里不接受，那里也不接受，谁来完成国家的任务呢？别人不接，我们接。”他们以工人阶级主人翁的责任感接下了这项任务。
    厂里把这项任务交给六级青工于纪先。完成这项任务需要五呎的螺旋铣床才行。他们没有这种设备。于纪先在老工人门寿禄和陈珍的帮助下，一次再一次的琢磨，把齿轮架在上面，找正、找平、卡牢，又把一台小机床立起来，安上立铣头，卡上玉米铣刀，这样一拼凑，便组成了第一台“积木式”机床。提前完成了这项大件加工任务。从此，工人们就豪迈地说：“我们可以加工无限大。”
    别看这是土办法
    这个厂在加工真空过滤板时，还有一段小故事。他们在接受任务时，第一次计算，过滤机板需要钻三十八万个眼。按当时全厂设计能力计算，可以勉强完成任务。但任务进厂以后才发现计算错了，是三百八十万个眼。这一下翻了十番。真了不得。怎么办呢？党总支召开了专门会议，讨论过滤机板的关键问题。厂长亲自深入到群众中去研究解决办法，发动群众献计。老工人宋振东和姚有国提出用废料拼凑多头钻床来完成这一任务。这个意见得到车间党组织的支持。在制造中，困难很多，没有图纸，没有现成实物，也没有技术员。用姚师傅的话来说就是：“正因为没有，才让我们来作，我们就用一双手和一个卡尺外加动脑筋，废料堆是我们材料的重要来源，一遍不行再来一遍”。在制造自动进给用的连杆时，就改了七八次，其他结构也是边制造，边设计。皮带轮上的摩擦离合器就是参考了自行车保险闸制成的。他们苦战了一个星期，第一台多轴自动钻床制造成功了。生产中的关键问题解决了。原来需要四年零三个月才能完成的任务，现在只六十天就完成了。
    既要高速还要精度
    跃进指标越来越高，干的活越来越大，要求的精度也越来越高。这种形势逼得他们不得不想办法。这时有的人提出要增添新设备，要“大干大，精干精”。市劳动模范、老工人吴炳玉说：咱们工厂应以勤俭为本，企业潜力很大，应好好挖挖，不能忙着买新床子。也有工人批评说：为什么不看过去，不看有利条件？在这样的思想指导下，他们开始向高速、高精度进攻。鼓风机盖的端面加工，本来是采用车削的方法，这样生产率太低，十六小时才能加工一个，主要困难是不易装夹，定位困难，不能打高速，且因孔距公差关系，精度不能保证。为了解决这个困难，老工人提出以双轴镗床加工孔和利用立铣来加工端面及孔圆。他们利用废料拼凑成积木式双轴镗床，同时也用旧料和车身回转平台配成积木式立旋机床。不但使生产效率提高十倍，而且完全保证了精度。试制成功后，他们骄傲地说：“我们可以加工任意直径平面。”他们愉快地唱道：不怕活大，不怕活精，脑筋一动，赛过神明。
    工人成了多面手
    “人是机器的主人，不能让死机器制住活人”。这是机联厂工人们的切身体会，也是他们的鼓舞力量。因为他们有这样的信念，所以他们把机器调动得千变万化，灵活听用。他们厂的机床，现在几乎没有一部还保有原来的“洋”面貌。不是这里多了一点什么，就是那里少了一点什么；不是那个机床的身子拼在这个机床上，就是这个机床的切削头拼在那个机床上。小的干大的，粗的干精的，真是花样翻新。有些用废件拼起来的机床或破旧的机床，看去简直像一堆废铁，可是它依然在那里为国家生产财富。解放后，工人在政治上翻了身，当了机器的主人。现在却是在技术上翻身，闹革命，要当机器的主人。机联厂的工人们确实是这样。他们想怎样就怎样，十分自由。他们创造了世界上还没有过的车椭圆形，多边形，钻孔里孔，等等。
    机器可以随便拼凑，人也成了多面手。他们有80％的技工能掌握二到十二种技术。二车间一个工人说：“我们车间的机床，每个工人都能开，没有固定人。”四车间是管装配的，二车间活忙时，他们就把任务拿过来，把机床一改，拼起各种“积木式”，车起来旋起来，真是方便。看，机器多听人的使唤！还是他们自己的结论正确：机器是人造的，要听从人的指挥，人是机器的主人。
