Xinhua News Agency, December 20th dispatch from Moscow: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on December 15th, closed in Moscow on the 19th.

The meeting heard and discussed the report by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on the results of the development of Soviet agriculture over the past five years and the tasks of further increasing agricultural production, and adopted a resolution on this report.

The resolution adopted by the meeting expressed full agreement with the political line and practical work taken by the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee in implementing the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee’s September 1953 Plenary Session, as well as subsequent Central Committee Plenary Sessions and the 20th Party Congress on agricultural issues. The resolution pointed out that the measures formulated by the Party during this period marked a new stage in the development and consolidation of the collective farm system and the entire socialist system. These measures are of great significance for the communist construction of the Soviet Union.

The resolution emphasized that the significant achievements made by the Soviet Union in developing agriculture also have great international significance. This not only strengthens the world socialist system but also provides a valuable example for other socialist countries in successfully developing agriculture on the road to communism.

The plenum believes that vigorously increasing grain production remains the most important task in developing Soviet agriculture in the future. In 1965, the Soviet Union's grain output should reach 9 billion to 11 billion poods (160 million to 180 million tons).

The main tasks in developing animal husbandry are to drastically increase the number of livestock and poultry and further improve the productivity of livestock products. Meat production (slaughter weight) should increase to at least 16 million tons in 1965, milk to 100 million to 105 million tons, wool production to approximately 548,000 tons, and egg production to 37 billion. The resolution pointed out that Soviet agriculture possesses the necessary potential and conditions for further developing animal husbandry.

The main tasks in agricultural mechanization are to produce a sufficient number of machines to liberate farmers from unproductive labor, enabling them to obtain more products with less manpower and resources. At the same time, collective farms and state farms should be further equipped with more advanced tractors and combine harvesters.

The resolution discussed improving the work of state farms, strengthening the public economy of collective farms, improving the material welfare of farmers, as well as the main tasks of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) and agricultural leadership. The resolution pointed out that the important task now is for every collective farm and state farm to formulate a seven-year plan for developing agriculture, taking into account the more comprehensive utilization of potential and drastically increasing product production while expending the least amount of manpower and resources per unit of product. The resolution also called for widely attracting collective farm members, state farm workers, and agricultural experts to participate in the formulation of the seven-year plan.

The resolution pointed out that the anti-Party group of factionalists has suffered a shameful defeat. Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov broke away from the masses of the people, opposed the vital interests of the people, and attempted to obstruct the implementation of the policies formulated by the 20th Party Congress on all important issues of domestic and foreign policy. This despicable group was exposed and defeated by the Central Committee and abandoned by the Party and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th dispatch from Moscow, December 18th: The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee continued on the 18th to discuss Khrushchev's report on the results of the development of Soviet agriculture over the past five years and the tasks of further increasing agricultural production. A total of twenty-one people spoke at the morning and evening sessions.

Pysin, Secretary of the Altai Krai Party Committee, spoke about the huge economic benefits of reclaiming wasteland. He said that in five years, the Altai state farms had obtained a net profit of 167 million rubles, and the state farms' funds had reached 479 million rubles. During this period, Altai sold 1.149 billion poods of grain to the state at the cheapest domestic price.

Shemichastny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, said when talking about the participation of Soviet youth in developing agriculture that there are now 1.3 million young men and women working on livestock farms, twice as many as in 1953. This year, the youth launched a competition to obtain high yields of corn on more than 5 million hectares of land. This year alone, the youth have opened up 300,000 hectares of orchards, vineyards, and afforestation zones. From 1954 to 1957, approximately 500,000 secondary school graduates participated in the work of collective farms.

Bulganin, Chairman of the National Economic Council of the Stavropol Krai, said at the plenary session that Khrushchev's report on the anti-Party group and everything the comrades said was consistent with the actual situation. He said that the members of the anti-Party group frequently opposed the successful policies announced and implemented by the Party's 20th Congress. They had obstructed and sabotaged the work of the Central Committee Presidium. Bulganin mentioned the frantic attacks launched by members of the anti-Party group on the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, and on expanding the powers of local Party organizations and Soviet organs in the Union Republics. He said that the actual situation proved that their hostile nonsense was extremely absurd and that the measures taken by the Central Committee were vital and timely. Bulganin said that Molotov was a person who was divorced from reality, not connected with the people, and did not understand industry and agriculture; Kaganovich was a windbag who often hindered work with his irrelevant, high-sounding talk; and Malenkov was a conspirator who was capable of any dirty trick.

Bulganin continued: When Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov frantically launched anti-Party activities in 1957, I agreed with them, supported them, and became their supporter and accomplice. At that time, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, I not only became their accomplice but also nominally became their leader. This anti-Party group often gathered in my office to plot anti-Party factional activities.

Bulganin said that the serious and principled criticism of the anti-Party group's criminal activities and my participation in this group enlightened me, helped me understand the entire harm of this group, and made me see the decay of the anti-Party mire into which I had fallen.

Bulganin said that now I will honestly strive to fulfill the obligations entrusted to me by the Central Committee. In the work of the National Economic Council, I have seen that the policies of our Party and its Central Committee, and its practical work in leading our country's national economy, are extremely brilliant and wise.

Starovina, Chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine, said: The era when we lacked grain and necessities has forever passed. The consumption of milk, meat, and oil by our people is increasing dramatically. This is due to the creative leadership of the Party Central Committee in agriculture after the September 1953 Plenary Session, the mobilization of mass initiative, and the defeat of the anti-Party factional group.

Gitalov, a tractor driver shock brigade leader and initiator of the competition for planting corn without manual labor, said that our cultivation level is much higher than that of the United States. He said that this year he spent three months studying the problem of planting corn with machines on American farms. It should be said that our scale has nothing in common with the scale of the United States. The degree of heavy mechanization of our agriculture is much higher than that of the United States. Gitalov expressed his belief that some existing backwardness in small-scale mechanization will be overcome, and intercropping crops will be planted with the least amount of labor.

Andreyeva, Chairman of the "Communist International" Collective Farm in Tambov Oblast, said that after the announcement of the control figures for the Seven-Year Plan, people gained an amazing strength to believe in their abilities. She said that the lives of people in her village have undergone great changes, and all farmers are studying in training courses, groups, night schools, and correspondence universities. Last year, the collective farm opened a night university. Farmers listened with great interest to lectures on literature, music, labor mechanization, and Soviet artificial satellites. Andreyeva emphasized that the growth of people, the frequent and continuous improvement of labor productivity, is the guarantee of our achievements.

    苏共中央全会就赫鲁晓夫农业报告通过决议 
    贯彻既定路线  大力发展农业
    今后最重要任务是增加谷物生产提高牲畜产品的生产率
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：12月15日开幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议，于19日在莫斯科闭幕。
    这次会议听取和讨论了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫关于最近五年来苏联农业发展的结果和进一步增加农产品产量的任务的报告，并且就这个报告通过了一项决议。
    会议通过的决议表示完全同意苏共中央主席团在实现苏共中央1953年9月全体会议以及后来历次中央全会和第二十次党代表大会关于农业问题的决议方面所采取的政治路线和实际工作。决议指出，党在这个时期所制定的措施标志了发展和巩固集体农庄制度和整个社会主义制度的新阶段。这些措施对苏联的共产主义建设具有重大意义。
    决议强调指出，苏联在发展农业方面所获得的重大成就也具有很大的国际意义。这不仅加强了世界社会主义体系，而且也为其他社会主义国家在走向共产主义道路上顺利发展农业方面作出了宝贵的榜样。
    全会认为，大力增加谷物生产今后仍然是发展苏联农业的最重要的任务。1965年，苏联谷物产量要达到九十亿至一百一十亿普特（一亿六千万至一亿八千万吨）。
    在发展畜牧业方面的主要任务是急剧增加牲畜和家禽的头数，进一步提高牲畜的产品生产率。肉类产量（屠宰重量）在1965年至少要增加到一千六百万吨，牛奶要增加到一亿至一亿零五百万吨，羊毛产量大约要达到五十四万八千吨，蛋类产量要达到三百七十亿个。决议指出，苏联农业拥有进一步发展畜牧业所必须的潜力和条件。
    在农业机械化方面的主要任务是，生产足够数量的机器，使农民摆脱生产率不高的劳动，使得能够花费较少的人力和物力而获得更多的产品。同时，应当以更完善的拖拉机和收获联合机来进一步装备集体农庄和国营农场。
    决议谈到了改进国营农场的工作、加强集体农庄公有经济、提高农民物质福利，以及七年计划（1959—1965年）的主要任务和农业领导问题。决议指出，现在的重要任务是每一个集体农庄和国营农场都来拟定发展农业的七年计划，在制定计划时要考虑到更全面地利用潜力，要考虑到在单位产品上花费最少的人力和物力的情况下急剧增加产品的生产。决议还要求广泛吸引集体农庄庄员、国营农场工人和农业专家参加七年计划的制定工作。
    决议指出宗派分子的反党集团已经遭到了可耻的失败。马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫脱离人民群众，反对人民的切身利益，企图阻挠实现二十次党代表大会对国内外政策一切重要问题所制定的方针。这个卑鄙的集团为中央委员会所揭露和击溃，并且为党和人民所唾弃。
    据新华社19日讯  塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏共中央全会18日继续讨论赫鲁晓夫关于最近五年来苏联农业发展的结果和进一步提高农产品产量的任务的报告。在上午会议和晚间会议上共有二十一人发言。
    阿尔泰边疆区党委会书记佩辛谈到了开垦荒地的巨大经济益处。他说，在五年当中，阿尔泰国营农场获得了一亿六千七百万卢布的纯利，国营农场的基金达到四亿七千九百万卢布。在这段时期中，阿尔泰向国家出售了国内价格最便宜的十一亿四千九百万普特的谷物。
    苏联共青团中央第一书记谢米恰斯内伊在谈到苏联青年参加发展农业的情况时说，现在在畜牧场工作的有一百三十万男女青年，比1953年多二倍。青年们今年展开了竞赛，争取在五百多万公顷土地上获得玉蜀黍的高额产量。青年们单在今年就开拓了三十万公顷的果园、葡萄园和植林地带。在1954年到1957年中，约有五十万中等学校毕业生参加了集体农庄的工作。
    斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区国民经济委员会主席布尔加宁在全会上说，赫鲁晓夫关于反党集团的报告以及同志们所说的一切都是符合实际情况的。他说，反党集团成员经常反对党的第二十次代表大会所宣布和执行的那样成功的方针。他们曾经阻挠和破坏中央主席团的工作。布尔加宁提到了反党集团成员对改组工业和建筑业的管理、对扩大加盟共和国地方党组织以及苏维埃机关的权力所发动的猖狂的进攻。他说，实际情况证明，他们敌意的胡说是极端荒谬的，证明中央采取的措施是富有生命力和及时的。布尔加宁说，莫洛托夫是脱离实际、不联系人民和不懂工业和农业的人，卡冈诺维奇是空谈家，他经常以不着边际的高谈阔论来妨碍工作，马林科夫是阴谋家，是个什么丑事都干得出来的人。
    布尔加宁接着说：当马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫和谢皮洛夫1957年猖狂展开反党活动时，我同意了他们，支持了他们，并且成了他们的拥护者和共谋者。我当时作为部长会议主席，不仅成了他们的共谋者，而且名义上成了他们的领袖。这个反党集团常常在我的办公室集会，策划反党的宗派活动。
    布尔加宁说，对反党集团的罪恶活动和我参加这个集团的事情进行的严肃的原则性的批判启发了我，帮助我明白了这个集团的整个害处，并且使我看到了我已经陷进去的反党泥潭的腐朽性。
    布尔加宁说，如今我要老老实实地努力履行中央委员会托付给我的义务。我在国民经济委员会工作中看到了我们党和它的中央委员会的政策、它在领导我国国民经济方面的实际工作是十分天才而英明的。
    乌克兰利沃夫州斯大林集体农庄主席斯塔罗维娜说：我们缺乏粮食，缺乏必需品的时代永远成为过去了。我国人民的牛奶、肉类和油类的消费量在急剧增加。这是由于党中央在1953年9月全会之后创造性地领导了农业，发挥了群众积极性，击溃了反党宗派集团。
    拖拉机手突击队长、不用手工劳动方法种植玉米竞赛的倡议者吉塔洛夫说，我们的耕作水平比美国要高得多。他说，今年我在美国农场用了三个月的时间研究用机器种植玉米问题。应该说，我们的规模同美国的规模毫无共同之处。我国农业的重型机械化程度比美国高许多。吉塔洛夫表示相信，在小型机械化方面现有的某些落后状况将会克服，并且将会在花费最少劳力的情况下种植中耕作物。
    坦波夫州“共产国际”集体农庄主席安德烈耶娃说，七年计划控制数字公布以后，使人们获得了相信自己才能的惊人力量。她说，她那个村里人们的生活起了很大的变化，所有的农民都在训练班、小组、夜校和函授大学里学习。去年集体农庄开办了夜大学。农民们极感兴趣地听取关于文学、音乐、劳动机械化以及苏联人造地球卫星等等的演讲。安德烈耶娃强调指出，人们的成长，劳动生产率经常和不断的提高，这就是我们取得成就的保证。
