The Masses Discuss Transferred Cadres

    Shi Lan is a Good Girl
    Whenever the departure of transferred cadres is mentioned, I feel bad. When Shi Lan first came to our house, she was a little reserved, but after a while, she became just like my own daughter. She went out to work from morning till night every day. I was afraid she wouldn't be able to take it and wasn't used to it, so I always made better food for her. But every time she refused, saying, "Don't treat me like a guest."

    The day before yesterday, she came back from outside and said softly, "Mother, I'm leaving!" When I heard this, I don't know why, my heart felt a pang, and tears came out. The day before yesterday, her "father" was working on the river project when he heard she was leaving, and he insisted on coming back to see her one last time.

    For the sake of national construction, she should leave. But the work is so busy, I don't know when she will be able to come back and see me again.

    Bringing Culture to the Countryside
    The cadres educated by Chairman Mao are truly capable in both culture and labor. As long as it is beneficial to the masses, they can do anything. Whatever they know, they always try to teach the masses. They are not only good at labor, but also established so many people's schools, spare-time middle schools, Red and Expert Universities, drama academies, and so on. Transferred cadres have brought culture to our countryside.

    Truly Good Cadres of the Party
    Transferred cadres are hardworking and simple, and they integrate with the masses. They also help our local cadres study their work and establish Party schools in our township. They truly do their best, using all their abilities. No wonder when they heard they were leaving, local cadres and the masses couldn't bear it, and everyone cried. At the farewell, Dong Wenchang's old father went on stage and said, "Transferred cadres are closer than our own children. It's cold, and I'm worried about them traveling on the road like this." Even the township Party committee's Secretary Zhou and Secretary Liu had tears in their eyes.

    Working with them for several months, I learned a lot, which is better than attending political school for several years.

    He Gets Up Even Earlier Than Me
    One of the transferred cadres who lived in my house was a section chief before being transferred. After coming to my house, he would get up early every morning to fetch water for us. I thought he was a leading cadre, so this was not appropriate. I told him not to fetch water, but he wouldn't listen. I made up my mind to get up earlier and fetch it myself. However, I got up early, but he got up even earlier, always ahead of me. ...

    He was very close to my children. When he left, the children hugged him and wouldn't let him go. My father and I were also very sad.

    党的好干部，群众的好儿女
    群众论下放干部
    石兰是个好闺女
    一提起下放干部走的事，我心里就不好受。石兰住到俺家，起初有点生疏，时间长了就真和我的亲闺女一样。她每天从早到晚地出去作活，我怕她受不了，不习惯，我总是做些好一点的饭叫她吃。可是她每一次都不愿意，说：“可不能把我当客人看待。”
    前天她从外边回到了家里，慢声慢气地说：“娘，我要走了！”我一听，也不知怎的，心里一酸，眼泪可出来啦。前天她“爹”在河工上正干活，一听说她要走了，说啥也得回来再见她一面。
    为了祖国建设，她走是应该的。不过工作这样忙，也不知啥时候才能再来看看我。
        （许昌河街乡  邢大娘）
    把文化带到农村来了
    毛主席教育出来的干部，真是能文能武能劳动。只要是有利于群众的事，什么都能干，只要他们会的东西，总要想办法教给群众。他们不光是劳动好，还办了这么许多民校、业余中学、红专大学、戏剧学院什么的。下放干部把文化带到咱们农村来了。
        （许昌河街乡  贺老大爷）
    真是党的好干部
    下放干部艰苦朴素，同群众打成一片。又帮助我们本地干部研究工作，在我们乡建立党校。他们真是各尽所能，有什么本事都尽量使出来。难怪一听说他们要走，本地干部和群众都舍不得，大家都哭了。在欢送时，董文昌的老父亲上台说：“下放干部比亲孩还亲，天冷了，这么走在路上我可不放心。”连乡党委的周书记和刘书记都眼泪汪汪的。
    和他们一起工作了几个月，学到了不少东西，真比上几年政治学校还强。（许昌椹涧乡长店管理区
          党支部书记  耿玉花）
    他比我起得更早
    住在我家的一位下放干部同志未下放前当处长，住到我家后，每天清早起来就给我们挑水。我想他是领导干部呀，这可不中。不叫他挑，他总不听。我打定主意，起得早些，自己挑。可是，我起得早，他起得更早，总是走在我的头里。……
    他和我的几个小孩亲热得很，走的时候，小孩都搂着他不放，不让走，我和父亲也难受的不行。
      （许昌椹涧乡王庄  董文昌）
