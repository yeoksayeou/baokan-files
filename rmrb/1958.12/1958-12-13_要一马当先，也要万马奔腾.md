Short Commentary:

    Not only take the lead, but also gallop forward together

    With steel as the key link, the steel industry has taken the lead, striding boldly at the forefront of the national economy. Industries such as machinery, coal, and electricity have also been driven forward. Now, the need is to ensure that light industry and other industries follow suit accordingly. Comrades in light industry and other industrial sectors have long been unable to contain their enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward, and the great development of the steel industry has also provided favorable conditions for the leap forward of light industry and other industries. Now is the time to let light industry gallop at full speed. The new situation we want to see on the economic front is one of taking the lead and galloping forward together.

    The situation of taking the lead and galloping forward together is fully in line with the law of proportionate development of the national economy. The national economy is a complex whole, and a certain proportion needs to be maintained between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, and between steel and other industries within heavy industry. This is an objective law that does not change according to people's will. Anyone who violates this law, grasping industry and losing agriculture, grasping heavy industry and losing light industry, grasping steel and losing other industries, will inevitably suffer some setbacks.

    Some comrades do not understand this principle. They think that taking steel as the key link is opposed to the law of proportionate development of the national economy. This view is completely wrong. Taking steel as the key link does not mean that we should abandon the law of proportionate development of the national economy; rather, it means that we should find a leading link in the various sectors of the national economy based on China's specific conditions, and grasp this leading link to drive the entire national economy to develop at a high speed and proportionately. As everyone knows, "without iron, you can't make steel"; with steel, many things are easier to handle. Therefore, in the final analysis, taking steel as the key link is to develop proportionately better, not to destroy proportionate development; it is to drive everything, not to squeeze out everything else.

    Some people think that since steel is the key link and drives everything, they will not move themselves, waiting for the day when the steel industry develops and comes to drive them. This idea is also wrong. It is not right to wait for others to drive you if you don't move yourself. Just imagine: if the steel industry takes the lead and other departments remain motionless, waiting to be "driven," if the coal industry does not increase coal production, the electricity industry does not increase electricity production, the machinery industry does not increase equipment production, and the light industry does not increase daily necessities for the steel army, these departments cannot develop, and the development of the steel industry will also be affected. What is this called galloping forward together! What is this called developing proportionately!

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed developing light industry accordingly while ensuring steel production, and has found some effective measures, which can give us some inspiration: not only take the lead, but also gallop forward together. This is not only required by the law of proportionate development of the national economy, but also completely achievable.

### 要一马当先，也要万马奔腾

    要一马当先，也要万马奔腾
    以钢为纲之后，钢铁工业一马当先，昂首阔步走在国民经济的最前列。机械、煤炭、电力等工业也被带动起来。现在需要提出的是，轻工业和其他工业也要相应地跟上去。轻工业和其他工业部门的同志跃进的热情早已按捺不住了，钢铁工业的大发展也为轻工业和其他工业的跃进提供了有利条件。让轻工业纵马加鞭，此其时也。我们要求经济战线上出现的新局面，就是这种一马当先、万马奔腾的局面。
    一马当先、万马奔腾的局面，是完全符合国民经济按比例发展的法则的。国民经济是一个复杂的整体，工业和农业、重工业和轻工业、重工业内部钢铁和其他产业之间，都需要保持一定的比例。这是一个不以人的意志为转移的客观法则，谁要是违反了这个法则，抓了工业丢了农业，抓了重工业丢了轻工业，抓了钢铁丢了其他，谁就难免吃些苦头。
    有些同志不了解这个道理，他们以为以钢为纲是同国民经济按比例发展的法则对立的。这种看法是完全错误的。以钢为纲并不是要我们丢掉国民经济按比例发展的法则；而是根据我国的具体情况，在国民经济各个部门中找到一个主导环节，要我们 抓住这个主导环节，去带动整个国民经济高速度地按比例地发展。大家知道，“手无寸铁”，常常一事无成；有了钢铁，许多事情都好办了。因此，归根到底，以钢为纲是为了更好地按比例发展，而不是去破坏按比例发展；是为了带动一切，而不是挤掉一切。
    有些人以为，反正是以钢为纲，带动一切，就自己不动，等待有朝一日钢铁工业发展了，跑到自己跟前来带动自己。这种想法也是错误的。自己不动，等着别人来带，是不行的。试想：钢铁工业一马当先，别的部门都按兵不动，等待着被“带动”，煤炭工业不增产煤炭，电力工业不增产电力，机械工业不增产设备，轻工业不增产钢铁大军日用生活必需品，这些部门既不能发展，钢铁工业的发展也受到影响，这还叫什么万马奔腾！还叫什么按比例地发展？
    中共山西省委提出在保证钢铁生产的同时相应地发展轻工业，并且已经找到一些有效措施，很可以给我们一些启发：既要一马当先，也要万马奔腾。这不仅是国民经济按比例发展的法则所要求的，也是完全可以做到的。
