Mobilize the Masses to Summarize Experiences and Overcome Technical Barriers in Copper Smelting
    Copper Water Flows Freely from Every Furnace, Monthly Output Increases Sharply

    (Our dispatch) In the upsurge of全民炼铜(all-people copper smelting) in Yunnan Province, a movement to summarize copper smelting experiences was launched among the people, mobilizing the masses to vigorously tackle technical barriers in copper smelting, and great achievements have been made. In November, the number of people smelting copper in the province decreased by half compared with October, but the output of crude copper doubled. From January to the end of November this year, more than 3,000 tons of crude copper have been produced.

    Since August, the quality of crude copper in Yunnan has been rising sharply month by month. In October and November, there were two province-wide high-yield weeks. The indigenous copper smelting movement has a broad mass base. However, most of the special district and county leaders have not yet figured out the general rules of indigenous copper smelting and lack leadership experience. On the other hand, after a month of practice, each special district and county has its own creations and experiences in mining, ore dressing, smelting, and furnace types. All local party committees seized this favorable opportunity between the production upsurges in October and November, mobilized the masses, and conducted in-depth summaries and comparisons through full-scale "mingfang" debates in front of the furnaces. Yongping County used to have serious furnace failure problems. The county party committee organized experienced people to "diagnose" these furnaces and made specific comparisons between good and bad furnaces. Advanced individuals gave live demonstrations in front of the furnaces, summarizing the local ten copper smelting experiences. Using these indigenous experiences, many work areas were able to achieve normal copper production from every furnace, and even high yields from every furnace. In just over forty days, the highest daily output increased from several hundred kilograms to more than 81 tons, becoming the county with the highest daily output. The First Secretary of the Zhenkang County Party Committee combined with cadres and workers to select thirty-four different types of furnaces and conducted systematic on-site operation experiments from furnace construction, air blowing, ore dressing, batching to smelting. As a result, copper water flowed freely from every furnace. Through comparative identification of these furnaces and various operating methods, a systematic set of copper smelting operating experiences was summarized. Therefore, the entire county quickly and comprehensively broke through the technical barrier. Many special districts and counties, such as the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture and the Beishan area, held furnace-side red and expert schools or technical training classes in various mining areas, enabling most furnaces to have skilled technical workers in a short period of time. The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Beishan area, and Simao area all used indigenous methods to compile the various operating experiences summarized this time into easy-to-understand rhymes, which the masses loved to sing and everyone knew how to do. In Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture, many furnaces had unsuitable tuyere angles, but there were no instruments for measuring the angles. They summarized the indigenous experience of "looking forward to see if it blows on the side of the furnace, and looking backward to see if it blows on the heart of the furnace." This proved effective for the vast majority of furnaces. In the Simao area, many furnaces had short lifespans, which affected output. However, a good solution was not found for a while. The masses were mobilized, and three sets of furnaces were built for each furnace group: one set for long-term use, one set for backup, and one set for temporary crash programs. The Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture discovered that one of the reasons for the low output in the previous stage was that the grade of the ore was too low and difficult to smelt. In November, the experience of multiple ore dressing was promoted throughout the prefecture, and it was generally done to select once during mining, once during crushing, and once again before entering the furnace, and some were selected six times before entering the furnace. This not only enabled many furnaces to produce copper normally, but also produced many high-yield furnaces.

    Through mass summary and evaluation, the leadership experience of the all-people indigenous copper smelting movement has been greatly enriched. In November, the number of people smelting copper in the province decreased by half compared with October, but the output of crude copper doubled.

### 发动群众总结经验攻破炼铜技术关  炉炉铜水畅流  月月产量猛增

    发动群众总结经验攻破炼铜技术关
    炉炉铜水畅流  月月产量猛增
    本报讯  云南省在全民炼铜的高潮中，展开了一个全民总结炼铜经验的运动，发动群众猛攻炼铜技术关，取得了很大成绩。11月份全省炼铜人数比10月份减少一半，但粗铜产量增加了一番。从今年1月到11月底，已经生产了粗铜三千余吨。
    8月份以来，云南粗铜质量月月直线上升，10月份和11月份，出现了两次全省规模的高产周，土法炼铜运动，有了广泛的群众基础。但大部分专县领导还没有摸出土法炼铜的一般规律，缺乏领导经验。另一方面，经过一个月的实践，每个专县，或在采、选方面，或在冶炼、炉型方面，也都各有各的创造和经验。各地党委都在10月和11月生产高潮之间，抓住这一有利时机，发动群众，通过充分的炉前鸣放辩论，展开深入的总结评比。永平县原来死炉现象严重，县委就组织有经验的群众到这些炉子前进行“会诊”，并以好坏炉子作具体比较，由先进人物在炉前现身说法现场表演，总结了当地的十条炼铜经验。运用这些土经验，许多工区做到了炉炉正常出铜，甚至炉炉高产。前后四十多天，最高日产量就由几百公斤上升至八十一吨多，一跃成了日产量最高的县份。中共镇康县委第一书记与干部、工人三结合，一起选择了三十四个不同类型的炉子，从建炉、鼓风、选矿、配料直到冶炼，做了系统的现场操作试验，结果炉炉铜水畅流。通过对这些炉子和各种操作方法的对比鉴定，总结了一套系统的炼铜操作经验。因此，全县很快就全面突破了技术大关。楚雄彝族自治州、北山地区等许多专县，都在各矿区举办了炉旁红专学校或技术训练班，在短期内使多数炉子有了操作熟练的技术工人。大理白族自治州、楚雄彝族自治州、北山地区、思茅地区等都把这次总结的各种操作经验用土法编成通俗易懂的歌诀，群众人人爱唱，个个会做。楚雄自治州许多炉子风嘴角度不合适，但又没有测量角度的仪器，便总结了“前看吹在炉子边，后看吹在炉子心”的土经验。这对绝大多数炉子都行之有效。思茅地区很多炉子寿命短，影响产量。但又一时未找出好的解决办法，便发动群众，每个炉群都建了三套炉子，有一套准备长期使用的，一套备用的和一套临时突击用的。楚雄自治州发现前一段产量不高的原因之一，是矿石品位太低，不易冶炼。11月份，便在全州推广了多次选矿的经验，普遍做到采矿时选一次，碎石时选一次，入炉前再选一次，有的在入炉前选过六次。不仅使许多炉子正常出铜，而且还出现了不少高产炉。
    通过群众性总结评比，大大丰富了全民土法炼铜运动的领导经验。11月份全省炼铜人数比10月份减少一半，但粗铜的产量却增加了一番。
