    For Smooth Flow of Molten Iron
    In the morning, it was raining heavily. Some of the teachers and students from the Wugong Agricultural School, who were sent to Yan'an for labor training, braved the autumn rain and cold wind, and stood fast at the steel front beside the Wunong Chaoying Hao (Wugong Agricultural School Super Hero Furnace) earthen blast furnace in Yan'ergou, Shigou Township. The wind grew stronger, and the rain fell more heavily, soaking their clothes. At this moment, someone brought a raincoat to Xiao Wenkuan, the charging operator. Xiao Wenkuan had been fighting beside the furnace for three days and three nights, his eyes bloodshot, sweat and raindrops mixed together, but he refused to put it on, and gave the raincoat to Li Wei, who was operating the bellows. Li Wei also refused to wear it. Everyone needed a raincoat at this time, but they all wanted to give it to someone else. After much back and forth, they finally discovered that the bellows was getting wet, so they unanimously agreed to put the raincoat on the bellows, so that the earthen furnace could overcome the wind and rain, and the molten iron flowed smoothly as usual in the heavy wind and rain.

    为了铁水畅流
    早晨，下着大雨，下放在延安劳动锻炼的武功农校的一部分师生，在石沟乡燕儿沟武农超英号土高炉旁，冒着秋雨寒风，坚守在钢铁阵地上。风越刮越大，雨越下越密，雨水浸透了他们的衣服。这时，有人给加料员萧文宽送来一件雨衣。萧文宽已经在炉子旁边战斗了三天三夜，两眼熬得通红，汗珠和水珠混在一起，但他不肯披，把雨衣让给拉风箱的李卫。李卫也拒绝穿。这时谁都需要雨衣，但都想让给别人。互让了好久，最后他们发现风箱被淋湿了，于是一致同意把雨衣披在风箱上，使土炉战胜风雨，在大风雨中铁水照常畅流。
