    Production Continuously Develops, Living Standards Increasingly Improve
    Albania's Commodity Turnover Greatly Increases This Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 28th: Many units in Albania's commercial sector have already completed their annual plans for 1958 ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the commercial sector, the commodity turnover in 1958 will increase by 31.5% compared to 1957.
    The development of commercial work in Albania this year demonstrates that, based on the development of production, the living standards of the working people have further improved. Since the rationing system was abolished ahead of schedule and the wages of the working people were generally increased last October, the purchasing power of the people has greatly increased. In the first nine months of this year, the supply of grain to the people by the socialist commercial sector increased by 15.9% compared to the same period last year, sugar increased by 24%, and cotton and woolen textiles increased by 34% and 56% respectively. With the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the improvement of agricultural cooperative production, the demand for industrial products from the vast number of peasants has greatly increased. Compared with 1957, the sales of wood and glass in rural areas this year have increased by 150%, and cement and furniture have more than tripled.
    Under the guidance of fully meeting the needs of the people and facing the workers and peasants, Albania's state-owned commercial departments and rural consumer cooperatives have made many efforts this year. In addition to expanding the original commercial network, increasing the variety of commodities, and expanding the source of goods, 194 new department stores and 79 food stores were newly built in various regions, and 732 family-style stores were opened in the vast rural areas.
    Now, the New Year of 1959 is approaching, and the Albanian commercial sector has prepared sufficient holiday goods for the people and is drawing up plans for next year. According to the commercial sector's estimates, the commodity turnover in 1959 will increase by 16% compared to 1958.

    生产不断发展  生活日益改善
    阿今年商品流转额大增
    新华社地拉那28日电  阿尔巴尼亚商业部门有不少单位已经提前完成了1958年的年度计划。据商业部门统计，1958年的商品流转额将比1957年增加31.5％。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚商业工作的发展说明，在生产发展的基础上，劳动人民的生活又有了进一步的改善。自从去年10月提前取消配给制和普遍增加劳动人民的工资以来，人民的购买力大大地提高了。在今年头九个月中，社会主义商业部门供应人民的粮食比去年同期增长了15.9％，糖增长了24％，棉、毛织品分别增加了34％和56％。随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展和农业合作社生产的提高，广大农民对工业品的需求大大增加了。和1957年相比，今年在农村中销售的木料、玻璃增加了一倍半，水泥和家具增加了两倍多。
    在充分满足人民需求和面向工农的方针的指导下，阿尔巴尼亚国营商业部门和农村消费合作社今年作出了不少的努力。除扩充原有的商业网和增多商品品种、扩大货源外，各个区新建了一百九十四个新百货商店和七十九个食品店，在广大农村开办了七百三十二个家庭式的商店。
    现在，1959年新年即将来临，阿尔巴尼亚商业部门已为人民准备了充裕的年节货品，并正在拟订明年的计划。据商业部门预计，1959年的商品周转额将比1958年增加16％。
