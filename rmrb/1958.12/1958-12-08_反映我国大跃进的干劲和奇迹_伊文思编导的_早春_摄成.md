Xinhua News Agency, 7th—The color documentary "Early Spring," directed in China by the famous film artist and peace fighter Joris Ivens of the Netherlands, has been successfully produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and will soon be released to audiences.

Ivens calls this documentary a "prose poem in film form." It consists of three short documentary films: "Winter," "Early Spring," and "Spring Festival," and is a record of Ivens' observations during his trip to China from early March to the end of April this year. The camera's lens shifts from the pastoral production cooperative in the Hulunbuir grasslands to the water conservancy projects along the Yangtze River and the homes of farmers by Taihu Lake, reflecting the drive and miracles of the Chinese people's socialist Great Leap Forward. Ivens said, "China is the most suitable country for filming documentaries," and he attempts to express his "admiration and confidence" in the Chinese people in this film.

This spring, Ivens came to China for the third time at the invitation of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. He originally planned to shoot a long documentary in China entitled "Snow." However, during his trip, he was moved by the reality of China's Great Leap Forward and decided to change his plan, immediately filming his observations into a short documentary and renaming it "A Letter from China." But when this short film was completed, under the rapid progress of China's leap forward, he found that "this letter was already too late." So, he changed his plan once again and co-produced this "Early Spring" with his Chinese colleagues.

Ivens has a strong interest in Chinese national art. In the artistic treatment of this film, he studied Chinese painting, national music, Peking Opera, and local operas. He believes that "Chinese painting handles space very well and is a very beautiful 'panoramic shot'; Peking Opera typifies the characters' movements and is an ideal 'close-up' in film." Therefore, from the selection of camera angles to the musical accompaniment, he paid attention to drawing lessons from these "sister arts." This film is entirely accompanied by Chinese national musical instruments, and many shots are filmed as if they were beautiful "Chinese paintings."

Ivens is an old friend of the Chinese people. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, he filmed the documentary "The 400 Million" reflecting the Chinese people's resistance against Japan and once asked someone to send a portable camera to Yan'an. When he finished filming "Early Spring" and left China this time, he said excitedly that he would come again next spring to cooperate with his Chinese colleagues to shoot another long documentary, following his famous work "Borinage," reflecting the tremendous changes in the lives of Chinese farmers.

### 反映我国大跃进的干劲和奇迹  伊文思编导的“早春”摄成

    反映我国大跃进的干劲和奇迹
    伊文思编导的“早春”摄成
    新华社7日讯  著名电影艺术家、和平战士荷兰约里斯·伊文思在我国编导的彩色纪录片“早春”，已经由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制成功，不久将同观众见面。
    伊文思称这部纪录片为“电影形式的散文诗”。它由“冬”、“早春”、“春节”三个纪录短片组成，是伊文思今年3月初到4月底在我国旅行的见闻记。摄影机的镜头从呼伦贝尔草原的牧业生产合作社转向扬子江南的水利工程和太湖畔农民的家庭中，它反映了中国人民社会主义大跃进的干劲和奇迹。伊文思说：“中国是最适于拍纪录片的国家”，他试图在这影片中表达他对中国人民的“钦佩和信心”。
    今年春天，伊文思应中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的邀请第三次来到中国。他原来准备在中国拍摄一部题名为“雪”的长纪录片。可是在旅行中他为中国大跃进的现实所激动，决定改变计划，立即把见闻拍成短纪录片，并改名为“一封来自中国的信”。可是当这部短片拍成时，在中国一日千里的跃进形势下，他发现“这封信已经迟到得太久了”。于是再一次改变计划，和中国同行们合拍了这部“早春”。
    伊文思对中国民族艺术有着浓厚的兴趣，在这部影片的艺术处理中，他研究了我国的国画、国乐、京剧和地方戏曲，他认为“中国国画空间处理的很好，是很优美的‘全景镜头’，京戏把人物的动作典型化了，更是电影中理想的‘特写’镜头”，因而他从选择镜头角度到配曲都注意从这些“姊妹艺术”中吸取教益。这部影片全部用中国的民族乐器伴奏，而且许多镜头拍的好似优美的“国画”。
    伊文思是中国人民的老朋友，早在抗日战争时期他就在中国拍了反映全中国人民抗战的纪录片“四万万人民”，并曾经托人把一部手提摄影机送到延安。这次拍完“早春”离开中国时，他兴奋地说，明年春天他还要来和中国的同行们合作，拍一个继他的名作“激流之歌”以后的又一部长纪录片，反映中国农民生活的巨大变化。
