    Oil palm originates from tropical Africa. It has been introduced and cultivated in Hainan Island and other places in China for more than 30 years. It is a woody oil plant suitable for development in the tropical regions of southern China.

    Oil palm has a wide range of uses, with its main products being palm oil, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel cake. The oil content of oil palm fruit reaches over 80%.

    Oil palm begins to bear fruit four to five years after planting, and ten to thirty years is its peak production period. Generally, middle-aged oil palm trees produce about 50 to 80 jin of fruit per year, hence the title "World Oil King." (Attached picture)
