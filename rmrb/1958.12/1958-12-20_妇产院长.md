That was on the third night after Feng Linmei returned from Qi County. The Chengguan Township Cooperative of Heshun County held a cooperative affairs meeting. Feng Linmei detailed what she had seen in Qi County regarding the establishment of an obstetrics and gynecology hospital and the convenience it brought to women. That very night, everyone decided to open an obstetrics and gynecology hospital, and elected the midwife station chief, Feng Linmei, as the director.

On July 18th, the day after the meeting, Feng Linmei and several midwives were as busy as if they were celebrating a happy event, running around. They cleaned the few empty rooms that the cooperative had just vacated, hauling soil, carrying water, plastering walls, and applying whitewash all by themselves. The cooperative could only allocate them 14 yuan temporarily, so they purchased the necessary mats, pots, bowls, spittoons, and bedpans according to the principle of running the hospital diligently and thriftily. Enthusiastic people also sent them some tables, benches, water vats, and other utensils. They also used old wooden boards and an old loom to convert it into a double-folding automatic delivery bed.

After two days of continuous hard work, everyone was quite tired. On the third night, everyone went home to rest, except for Feng Linmei, who was guarding the house alone. Unexpectedly, a woman in labor suddenly arrived late that night.

This was the first pregnant woman to be welcomed after the hospital was established. Although Feng Linmei had delivered countless babies, she seemed a little different and nervous tonight. She felt that this young woman, giving birth for the first time, came here as a great support and trust to them. At dawn, she carefully delivered a chubby baby boy for the woman.

Feng Linmei specifically asked for the young woman's name, Li Aihua, a member of the Communist Youth League, who worked as a cook in the public canteen... It seemed she wanted to record these details to commemorate the establishment of the hospital.

When Feng Linmei lay in bed, looking at the soundly sleeping mother and child, she couldn't fall asleep no matter what. She thought about many things...

Feng Linmei had a tragic past. She had begged for food, lived in caves and dilapidated temples, and was forced to sell two daughters around 1940.

In 1945, Heshun County was liberated, and she became an active participant in the struggle against landlords, serving as the chairman of the village women's salvation association, and joined the Party the following year. After 1948, she continued to serve as the village party branch secretary.

Feng Linmei's work as a midwife may have been somewhat accidental. Heshun County is a remote and backward mountainous area, where traditional methods of delivery had always been used. After childbirth, women were not allowed to lie in bed but could only sit with high pillows, and when hungry, they were not allowed to eat but could only drink a little rice soup. As a result, newborns often did not survive, and the danger to the mother was also great. In 1952, when the county established a new-method midwifery training class, it was difficult to send anyone. Feng Linmei was a Party member, and she knew that a Party member should care about the lives of the masses in all aspects. Moreover, her own mother had used traditional methods to deliver babies for others in the past, so she understood these things to some extent. She took the lead in personally attending the training. When she returned, she went around promoting the new methods of delivery, but people bound by old habits did not understand her good intentions for a while. Some people even said, "Feng Linmei, you say it's so good, why don't you try it yourself first?" She felt sad and annoyed when she heard this. Yes, she was already over forty years old and could no longer bear children, otherwise, wouldn't she have set an example for you?

The opportunity finally came. In 1954, her daughter-in-law, who worked in Zuoquan County, was about to give birth. This was finally someone from her own family. Feng Linmei wrote a letter to her daughter-in-law, asking her to come to Heshun County to give birth and telling her that everything must be done using the new methods of delivery. Her daughter-in-law was a very sensible person, and she immediately replied to her mother-in-law with a warm letter, saying that she needed her mother-in-law's care.

So Feng Linmei happily prepared everything, the most important thing being to organize pregnant women to visit. But when the time came, many pregnant women did not come. They heard from others that if a pregnant woman entered someone else's delivery room, the baby in her womb would not be protected. Feng Linmei finally found the husband of the pregnant woman Li Yinxi, because he was a Party member, and asked him to persuade his wife to visit. Li Yinxi listened to her husband's advice and came to visit. Li Yinxi had previously given birth to six children, but all six children had died of convulsions five or six days after birth. This time, Li Yinxi placed all her hopes on Feng Linmei. As a result, after using the new method of delivery, her seventh child survived.

People's views of Feng Linmei changed. She presided over a village party branch meeting, which decided that Party members should take the lead, and that anyone who was about to give birth must use the new method of delivery. The masses saw that the Party members were taking the lead, and besides, it was a good thing, so who would not agree?

Now, the hospital has been established for more than four months, and a total of more than eighty children have been delivered. More than two hundred people have had prenatal check-ups, and the promotion of pregnancy hygiene and the menstrual cycle card system has been widely implemented. It has also assisted the regional hospital in training more than thirty grassroots midwives. It only costs about one yuan and five jiao for a woman to stay in the hospital for a week.

"I am very happy with everything. The Party points out the path I should take, and I will always follow the Party. I will never go wrong. The Party has also helped me find one of my daughters that I sold in the past, but the eldest daughter has not yet been found. If she is still alive, she must be very happy now, but I still hope to find her. She should be twenty-one years old this year. I clearly remember that she has a small black mole on her left wrist..."

I finally made a special note of this passage from Feng Linmei. Like Feng Linmei, I also hope that a miracle will happen, and one day, Feng Linmei will finally find her lost daughter.

    妇产院长
    江之水
    那是冯林梅从祁县回来的第三天夜里，和顺县城关乡合作社召开了一个社务会议，冯林梅把她在祁县看到人家建立妇产院的情形和给妇女们带来的方便详细地作了介绍。就在这天夜里，大家也决定了开办妇产院，选接生站站长冯林梅当了院长。
    7月18日，也就是开会的第二天，冯林梅和几个接生员就忙碌得像办喜事一样地东奔西跑，她们把社里新给腾出的几间空房子打扫得干干净净，抬土、担水、糊墙、刷浆都是她们自己干的。社里暂时只能拨给她们十四元钱，她们就根据勤俭办院的方针，购买了必需的席子、锅碗、痰盂、便器。热心的群众，还送给她们一些桌、凳、水瓮等用具，她们自己又用旧木板和旧织布机改制成一架双折自动产床。
    一连忙碌了两天，大家也够累的了。第三天夜里，人们都回家休息了，只有冯林梅一个人看守着房子，可是，万没想到就在这天深夜产妇突然来了。
    这是产院成立后迎接的第一个产妇，冯林梅虽然已经接过无数的胎了，但她今夜显得有些异样、紧张，她觉得这位生第一胎的年青的产妇到这里来是对她们莫大的支持、信任。黎明时分，她细心地给产妇拾下了一个胖胖的男孩子。
    冯林梅特意问清了这年青的产妇叫李爱花，是个共青团员，在公共食堂担任炊事员……好像她要记下这些，来纪念产院的成立。
    等冯林梅躺在床上，望着那甜睡的母子，却无论如何也不能入睡，她想得很多很多……。
    冯林梅有过一段悲惨的遭遇，她讨过饭，住过山洞、破庙，1940年前后被迫卖过两个女儿。
    1945年和顺县解放了，她成了斗争地主的积极分子，担任了村妇救会主席，第二年加入了党。1948年以后又一直担任了村支部书记。
    冯林梅作起接生员，也许是有些偶然的。和顺县是个偏僻落后的山区，这一带一直是用旧法接生，产妇生娃以后不能躺床，只能坐高枕，饿了不能吃饭，只能喝两口米汤。因此新生的娃儿经常保不住命，产妇的危险也很大。1952年县里成立新法接生训练班时，怎么也派不出人去。冯林梅是个党员，她深知道一个党员应该从各方面关心群众的生活，又搭上自己的母亲过去给人旧法接过生，她多少懂一点这些事，她就带头亲自去受训了。回来，她四处奔走宣传新法接生，然而受旧习惯束缚的人们，一时还不理解她的苦心，还有人说：“冯林梅，你说的这么好，你自己怎么不先试试呢？”她听了又难过又好气。是呀，自己已经四十多岁了，不能生养了，要不就给你们带个头又怎的？
    机会终于来了，1954年，她在左权县工作的儿媳妇要生养了，这总算是自己家的人了吧。冯林梅给儿媳妇写了一封信，叫她来和顺县生养，并且告诉她一切都要用新法接生。儿媳妇是个非常懂事的人，她马上给婆婆回了一封热情的信，说她正需要婆婆的照应呢。
    于是冯林梅就高兴地张罗着一切，最主要的还是组织大肚子们来参观。可是到时候好多孕妇又不来了。她们听别人说，孕妇进别人家的产房，自己肚里的娃就保不住了。冯林梅最后找到孕妇李银细的丈夫，因为他是个党员，让他动员自己的妻子来参观。李银细果然听了丈夫的劝告前来参观了。李银细以前生过六个孩子，但是六个孩子都在生下五、六天时抽风死了。这次，李银细把希望都寄托在冯林梅身上，结果用新法接生后，她这第七个孩子保住了。
    人们对冯林梅的看法变了。她主持召开了村支部大会，决定由党员带头，以后凡是要生孩子的一定要用新法接生。群众看党员都带头了，再说又是好事情，还有不赞成的吗？
    现在，产院已经成立四个多月了，一共接生了八十多个孩子。做了胎前检查二百多人，普遍推广了孕期卫生及经期挂牌制度，还协助地区医院培训了三十多名基层助产员。产妇住院一周也只要一元五角左右就行了。
      “我一切都顺心极了。党指给我要走的路，我永远跟着党走，我的路是不会走错的。党也帮助我找回了我过去卖掉的一个女儿，只是大女儿还没找到。假若她还活着，现在也一定很幸福，但我总还是想能找到她。她今年该已是二十一岁了，我清楚地记得，在她左手腕上有一个不大的黑痣……。”
    我最后特意记下了冯林梅的这一段原话，我也像冯林梅一样地希望着出现一个奇迹，有一天，冯林梅终于找到了她失去的女儿。
