    Cable Industry Leaps Towards Cutting-Edge Technology
    Shenyang Produces 220,000-Volt High-Voltage Cable Sample

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th: A 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage oil-filled, lead-sheathed, paper-insulated power cable sample was successfully trial-produced at the Shenyang Cable Factory on the 7th. This is currently the cable with the highest voltage level in our country. Its successful trial production marks a new achievement in our country's cable industry's leap forward towards the world's cutting-edge technology.

    The 220,000-volt high-voltage cable was designed in collaboration by four units: the Shenyang Cable Factory, the Cable Research Institute, Jiaotong University, and the Shanghai Cable Factory.

    220,000-volt high-voltage cables have a wide range of uses. High-voltage power distribution devices in large and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations are connected to overhead lines in open-air distribution substations via dams. High-voltage networks passing through airports or large buildings, and power plants from the suburbs to urban distribution centers all require the laying of high-voltage cables.

    电缆工业向尖端技术飞跃
    沈阳制出二十二万伏高压电缆样品
    据新华社沈阳12日电  二十二万伏超高压充油铅包纸绝缘电力电缆样品，7日在沈阳电缆厂试制成功。这是目前我国电压级最高的一种电缆，它的试制成功，标志着我国电缆工业向世界尖端技术飞跃前进中又取得了新的成就。
    二十二万伏高压电缆，是由沈阳电缆厂、电缆研究所、交通大学、上海电缆厂等四个单位协作设计的。
    二十二万伏高压电缆的用途很广，大、中型水电站的高压配电装置上通过水坝与露天配电所架空线路联接，高电压网路通过飞机场或大厦，发电站从市郊至城市配电中心等处，都需要敷设高压电缆。
