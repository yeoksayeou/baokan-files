    Seven Fairies of the Tea Mountain
    National Women's Activist Representative, Xiaoche Commune, Wufeng County, Hubei Province, Xie Chengzhen

    In the past, in our tea mountain, there was a saying: "Tea is good, but feared; planting grain means losing tea, caring for tea means lacking grain; if you want a double harvest of grain and tea, unless the world turns upside down." The main key to the contradiction between agriculture and tea was the lack of labor, so we had to find ways to work cleverly.

    Last year, tea-picking expert Li Zhongxin created the two-handed tea-picking method, which increased the daily yield from thirty jin to forty-five jin, and was named a county-level labor model. This year, during the Great Leap Forward, the county party committee proposed launching a skill-master movement, calling on everyone to learn from Li Zhongxin, catch up with Li Zhongxin, and surpass Li Zhongxin. Thirty-nine women in our commune were the first to respond to the call. Under the personal cultivation of the district party secretary, and after a week of diligent study and hard practice, we all learned the two-handed tea-picking method. My daily yield increased from thirty-five jin to seventy-eight jin, and forty-five-year-old elder sister Feng Shenglian picked seventy-eight point twelve jin. Based on the situation, we were determined to break through the 100-jin daily barrier. At that time, conservatives strongly opposed it. After a great airing of views, a big debate, we broke through conservatism. The party branch also specially sent technicians to guide and encourage us. "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." We wrote a letter of determination proposing "High bridges, high racks, high mountains, east of the river, west of the river, holding hands, even if the bridge breaks and the river dries up, we will not let go, and we are determined to pick 100 jin of tea a day." In this way, the entire commune quickly set off an even greater competitive upsurge. At that time, elder sister Feng Shenglian and I were the first to successfully break through the 100-jin barrier. Leaders from the prefectural party committee, the Yichang military sub-district, the county party committee, and the county women's federation and the Communist Youth League visited and praised us, which further boosted the revolutionary drive of the entire commune. Soon, one hundred and eight generals with daily yields of more than fifty jin appeared. Before long, seven of our girls had reached more than 100 jin each day, and the commune members called us the "Seven Fairies."

    The highest daily tea-picking records of our seven sisters are: eldest sister Feng Shenglian, 101 jin; second sister Wang Yingmei, 147 jin; third sister Du Yongyu, 143 jin; fourth sister Zhou Qiyu, 535 jin 10 liang; sixth sister Xie Yongmei, 628 jin 9 liang; seventh sister, 609 jin; I once picked 1,157 jin.

    When we heard that the tea-picking sisters in Changyang County had launched a campaign to catch up with the "Seven Fairies" and created a daily yield of 300 jin and 506 jin of fresh leaves, we immediately proposed new goals and technical measures to reach 530 jin. We changed the original "charge and attack" method to "sparrow warfare," dividing into two groups to chase each other. Three days later, we created the "rooster pecking rice" tea-picking method, and also learned the "bow-shaped direct shot" method from Hefeng County and the high-speed picking method from Sichuan. Daily output has greatly increased since then.

    Mastering new technologies is a process of arduous struggle. In order to train the backhand tea-picking, I used my backhand to hold chopsticks when eating, I also used my backhand to cut pigweed, and I also used my backhand to pick weeds and leaves when sitting and resting. In short, I practiced while walking, sitting, and eating. The time I picked 1,157 jin, I used the technology created by using eight fingers in parallel, many buds at a time, flat shovel, lateral insertion, left and right cutting branches, along the plant, and turning dragon. The provincial news film studio has put our skills on the screen. Commune members say we: "The fairy maidens in heaven can spin yarn, the fairy maidens on earth can pick tea, the fairy maidens' magical powers are really great, and they insert the red flag in the experimental fields. Everyone can be called a versatile person, and the fairy maidens' deeds are praised by everyone."

    In the entire labor process, we can not only pick tea, but also actively create in agricultural work, so some people call us omnipotent fairies. Fourth sister and I planted 15 mu of corn in one day, and were named planting experts. Second sister and I created a daily weeding of 45 to 54 mu of corn, and were named weeding experts. Fourth sister and sixth sister prevented and controlled corn borers on 132 mu, and were named epidemic prevention experts. Third sister and seventh sister top-dressed 119 mu of corn per day, and were named fertilizer application experts. There are also experts in rice transplanting, manure accumulation, etc. The county party committee inserted our "Seven Fairies" banner all over the county and promoted it to various production contents, setting off a production competition movement of "learning from the Seven Fairies, catching up with the Seven Fairies, and surpassing the Seven Fairies." There are now one hundred and twelve such people as the Seven Sisters, the Eight Immortals, the Ten Elder Sisters, and Ever-red, as well as twenty-four advanced organizations and ninety-three teams totaling one thousand and seventy-seven people such as the Eighteen Immortals, Hua Mulan, and Mu Guiying. There are 3,205 tea-picking experts. In this way, it is almost as if there are fairies everywhere in our county!

    茶山七仙女
    全国妇女积极分子代表  湖北省五峰县小河社  谢承珍
    我们茶山过去有这样一种说法：“茶叶好，怕茶叶，种了粮食丢茶叶，顾了茶叶粮又缺，要想粮茶双丰收，除非二世转了节。”农茶矛盾的主要关键，是劳动力不够，因此必须想办法巧干。
    去年，采茶能手黎中新创造了双手采茶法，由原来日采三十斤提高到四十五斤，被评为全县的劳动模范。今年大跃进，县委提出开展能手运动，叫大家学习黎中新，赶上黎中新，超过黎中新。我们社里有三十九个妇女，首先响应号召。在区委书记亲自培养下，经过一个星期的勤学苦练，我们全都学会了双手采茶法。我由原来日采三十五斤提高到七十八斤，四十五岁的大姐冯胜莲采到七十八点十二斤。我们根据情况，决心突破日采一百斤关。当时保守派反对得厉害，经过大鸣大放大辩论，打破了保守，党支部还专门派技术员指导和鼓励我们。“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，我们写决心书提出“高桥高架高山下，河东河西把手拉，桥断河干不松手，坚决日采百斤茶。”这样全社又迅速掀起了一个更大的竞赛高潮。当时我和冯胜莲大姐首先胜利突破了一百斤关，地委、宜昌军分区，县委和县妇联、共青团等首长去访问表扬我们，因此更加鼓舞了全社的革命干劲。随着就出现了日采五十斤以上的一百单八将。不久，我们有七个姑娘都达到一百斤以上了，社员们就称我们为“七仙女”。
    我们七姐妹日采茶叶的最高纪录是大姐冯胜莲一百零一斤，二姐汪应枚一百四十七斤，三姐杜永玉一百四十三斤，四姐周启玉五百三十五斤十两，六妹谢永枚六百二十八斤九两，七妹六百零九斤，我曾采到一千一百五十七斤。
    我们听说长阳县的采茶姐妹开展了猛赶“七仙女”运动、创造了日采鲜叶三百斤和五百零六斤的时候，立即提出新的奋斗目标和技术措施，要达到五百三十斤。我们把原来“冲锋陷阵”式的办法改为“麻雀战术”，分为两个小组，互相追赶。三天以后又创造出“雄鸡啄米”式采茶法，同时还学会了鹤峰县的“弓形直射”法和四川的高速采摘法等等技术。日产量就此大大提高了。
    掌握新技术是经过艰苦斗争过程的。为了训练反手采茶，我在吃饭时反手拿筷，打猪草也用反手，坐着休息时也用反手摘野草和树叶子，总之行坐吃饭都在练习。我采到一千一百五十七斤的那次，就是用了八指并下、一次多芽、平铲、横插、左右切枝、顺株、转龙的技术创造出来的。省里的新闻电影制片厂已把我们的技巧搬到银幕上了。社员说我们：“天上仙女会纺纱，地上仙女会采茶，仙女神通真广大，试验田里把红旗插，个个可称多面手，仙女事迹人人夸。”
    我们在整个劳动过程中，不仅能采茶，而且在农活方面，也是积极的创造，所以有人又称我们为万能仙女。我和四姐一天种包谷十五亩，评为播种能手。我和二姐创造日锄包谷草四十五亩到五十四亩，评为锄草能手。四姐六妹防治包谷虫一百三十二亩，评为防疫能手。三姐七妹日追包谷肥一百一十九亩，评为施肥能手。还有评为插秧、积肥等能手的。县委把我们“七仙女”这面旗子插遍了全县各地，推广到各项生产内容中去，掀起了一个“学七仙、赶七仙、超七仙”的生产竞赛运动。全县现已出现了七姊妹，八仙姑，十大姐，月月红等一百一十二人，十八仙姑，花木兰，穆桂英等先进组织二十四种，九十三个队一千零七十七人，出现采茶能手三千二百零五人。这样一来，我们县里简直到处都有仙女了！
