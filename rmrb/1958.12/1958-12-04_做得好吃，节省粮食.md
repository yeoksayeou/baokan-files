    Cook Well, Save Grain

    Before dawn, cook Zhang Quan'ying gets up. Generally, female cooks can only prepare meals for about twenty people, but she and another female cook take on all the work for more than seventy people in the Xuying team canteen of the Shangqiao Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune in Zhongning County, and they don't repeat a meal in five days.

    Whether adults or children, everyone says the food Zhang Quan'ying makes is delicious. Congee is served for breakfast, noodles are changed for lunch, and steamed buns are eaten in the evening, and a new variety is changed tomorrow. Moreover, she always arranges each meal on time, serving hot meals and dishes to the members' tables. While everyone is eating, she is still busy arranging things, taking care of the elderly and children, and doesn't eat her own meal until everyone has finished. People always see her wearing a white apron, sweeping and cleaning here, tidying up and arranging there, and the kitchen, dining room, and the adjacent library are always free of dust and food scraps. People feel exceptionally refreshed as soon as they enter the room.

    Some female cooks always ask the leadership to assign one or two male cooks to help carry water and chop firewood, but Zhang Quan'ying takes on all these tasks, working as well as a male laborer. Although she is busy all day long, she never complains.

    Zhang Quan'ying is also a master of saving grain. She grinds broken rice grains into flour to eat and often figures out ways to produce more food. In just four months, she has saved nearly six hundred catties of grain for the canteen. Therefore, when people talk about Zhang Quan'ying, they all say: "There's no question about it, Zhang Quan'ying is good in every way, such a good cook is really hard to find."

    做得好吃，节省粮食
    天不亮，炊事员张全英就起床了。一般女炊事员只能做二十多个人的饭，她却和另外一个女炊事员包了中宁县东风公社上桥大队徐营小队食堂七十多人的全部工作，而且五天不吃重样饭。
    无论是大人、娃娃，都说张全英做的饭好吃。早点调和饭，午餐变了面条，晚上又吃上了蒸馍，明天又换了新花样。而且，她每餐总是准时安排得好好的，热饭热菜端到社员桌上。大伙儿在吃饭，她还在四处张罗，照顾老人、小孩，一直到人人吃完了，她才端碗吃饭。人们总看见她围上个白围裙，这里打扫擦洗一番，那里收拾安排一下，厨房、饭厅和旁边的图书室里都经常没有一丝尘土，没有一点菜屑饭粒。人们一进屋，就感到分外清爽。
    有些女炊事员总要领导上给配备一两个男炊事员，帮助挑水、砍柴，张全英却把这些事全包下来，顶个男劳动力干。虽然一天忙个不停，她从来没有叫过一声苦。
    张全英也是个节约粮食的能手，她把碎米粒磨面吃，经常琢磨多出饭的办法。短短的四个月里，就给食堂节约了粮食近六百斤。因此人们谈起张全英时，都说：“没二话可说，张全英样样都好，这样好的炊事员真难找。”  （王玉如、景广信）
