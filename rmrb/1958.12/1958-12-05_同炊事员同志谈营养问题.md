    To ensure that every member of the commune eats properly, receives good nutrition, maintains good health, and achieves high work efficiency and good labor, the most practical and important work is the canteen’s cooking. The kitchen is a food manufacturing plant, a health insurance company. Cooking work is a strong guarantee of health and an indispensable part of revolutionary work.

    What are the important tasks of a cook? It is not only to cook food thoroughly and hygienically, but also to make it nutritious. This requires every cook to master nutritional hygiene knowledge and make food that is both delicious and nutritious.

    Talking about nutrition means studying the science of eating, researching what nutritional components are contained in food, and how to allocate them to benefit everyone's health and maximize efficiency. Eating food and vegetables cannot be considered complete by simply being full.

    The nutrients contained in food are six types: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water. Some of these nutrients provide energy for people to gain strength, some repair body tissues, and some regulate physiological functions, each with different uses.

    The main function of protein is to constitute the main material of human muscles and organs. It is abundant in meat, eggs, and beans. The main source of protein in our usual diet is grain food, followed by beans, meat, and eggs; fat and carbohydrates mainly provide energy for the body, so that members have the strength to work. The various oils we often eat, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and peanut oil, are fats; carbohydrates are mainly present in staple foods, such as rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains, which contain about 70% carbohydrates. The main component of sweet potatoes, besides water, is also carbohydrates; minerals are the main components of human bones and teeth. If food lacks these things, teeth and bones will not grow well. The main source of minerals is vegetables; vitamins, also called vitamines, are essential substances for promoting health. There are many types of vitamins, and the five most relevant to humans are vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin C, and vitamin D. If vitamin A is lacking, the body's resistance to disease will be reduced, the skin will be rough, and severe cases will suffer from night blindness. Vitamin A is contained in animal liver, and green leafy vegetables contain a substance called carotene, which can also be converted into vitamin A in the body, so eating green leafy vegetables regularly will prevent night blindness. Vitamin B1 is mainly found in brown rice and coarse flour, but not much in refined rice and white flour. Therefore, in areas where people like to eat refined white rice and flour, they are prone to lack this vitamin. Lack of this vitamin can cause poor appetite, unwillingness to eat, lack of energy, and severe cases can lead to beriberi. Vitamin B2 is mainly contained in animal liver, kidney, and milk. Generally, people rarely eat milk in their diets, so it is relatively easy to lack. However, eating more coarse grains, beans, and vegetables can also provide a certain amount of vitamin B2. Lack of vitamin B2 can easily lead to angular cheilitis and glossitis. Vitamin C is mainly contained in fresh vegetables and fruits. Lack of it can easily cause bleeding gums and make the body feel tired, so everyone must often eat fresh vegetables and fruits. Vitamin D is closely related to the healthy growth of bones. Infants and young children especially need this vitamin. Lack of it will affect the growth of teeth and bones. The main substance containing this vitamin is cod liver oil. If conditions are limited and cod liver oil cannot be eaten, eating some eggs or getting more sun exposure can also help. Because sunlight shining on the skin can turn a substance in the body into vitamin D.

    In addition to appropriately allocating staple and non-staple food varieties so that comrades get suitable nutrients, a cook should also pay attention to cooking methods to make the dishes suit everyone's taste. In addition, it is also important to note: do not rub the rice with your hands when washing it, just wash it clean and remove the sand. Washing it too many times or soaking it in water for too long will lose some nutrients. Stir-fry vegetables only until they are cooked; stewing them for too long or making them too soft will also destroy nutrients.

    The work of a cook is a noble and meaningful work, which is directly related to everyone's work and life. Many cooks have already created many good experiences to ensure that comrades eat their fill and eat well. What is discussed here are just some of the simplest common sense.

    同炊事员同志谈营养问题
    淮冬
    为要使公社内每个社员吃得合适，得到好的营养，身体健康，工作效率高，劳动好。最实际而重要的工作就是食堂内的炊事工作。厨房是饮食制造所，是健康的保险公司。炊事工作是健康的有力保证，是革命工作不可缺少的部分。
    炊事员的重要任务是什么呢？那就是不仅饭菜要煮熟而且要合卫生，要有营养。这样就要求每位炊事员同志都能掌握营养卫生知识，把饭菜作得既可口，又富于营养。
    讲营养，就是研究吃饭的学问，研究食物内含些什么营养成分，怎样调配才使大家吃了对身体有好处，发挥最高的效能。吃饭吃菜，是不能光顾吃饱了就算完事的。
    食物内所含的营养素有六种：蛋白质，脂肪，醣，维生素，矿物质和水，这些营养素有的供给能力叫人长劲，有的修补身体组织，有的调节生理机能，各有不同的功用。
    蛋白质主要的功用是构成人体肌肉和器官的主要材料，肉类、蛋类和豆类食物内含量很多，我们平常膳食内蛋白质的主要来源是谷类食物，其次是豆类、肉类和蛋类食物；脂肪和醣主要是供给身体的热能，使社员吃了有力气干活，我们常吃的各种油，如豆油，菜油，花生油等就是脂肪；醣主要存在于主食里，如米，面，杂粮中有70％左右是醣，白薯里面除去水份外，主要成分也是醣；矿物质是构成人体骨胳牙齿的主要成分，若食物中缺少这些东西，牙齿和骨头就长不好，矿物质的主要来源是蔬菜；维生素也叫维他命，是促进身体健康必不可缺的物质。维生素的种类很多，与人最有关系的有五种，即维生素甲，维生素乙1，维生素乙2，维生素丙，维生素丁等。若缺少维生素甲，则人体对疾病的抵抗力降低，皮肤粗糙，重的会患夜盲病，维生素甲含于动物肝脏里面，绿叶菜中含有一种叫作胡萝卜素的东西，在身体内也可变成维生素甲，所以常吃绿叶菜就不会得夜盲症。维生素乙1主要存在于糙米；粗面里面，精米白面中倒不多，所以在喜吃精白米面的地区，人们就容易缺乏这种维生素，缺乏这种维生素时会引起胃口不好，不想吃东西，没有力气，厉害时就得脚气病。维生素乙2主要含于动物肝，肾，奶中，一般人膳食内很少吃牛奶，故比较容易缺乏，但若多吃些粗粮，豆类和蔬菜，也就能得到一定量维生素乙2，缺乏维生素乙2，容易得烂口角、舌炎这类病。维生素丙主要含于新鲜蔬菜水果里面，缺乏时牙齿容易出血，身体容易感到疲倦，因此每个人必须经常吃到新鲜蔬菜和水果。维生素丁与骨头长的好坏很有关系，婴、幼儿特别需要这种维生素，缺乏时会影响牙齿和骨胳的生长。含有这种维生素的主要物质是鱼肝油，若限于条件吃不到鱼肝油，能吃些鸡蛋或多晒晒太阳也可以。因为太阳照射到皮肤上面可以使身体内一种物质变成维生素丁。
    一个炊事员除了适当的调配主副食花样，使同志们得到适宜的营养素以外，还要注意烹调方法，使得作出的菜合乎大家的口味。另外也要注意：洗米时不要用手搓，只要洗净淘掉砂子就行，洗的次数过多或用水浸泡太久会损失一些营养素。炒菜只要炒熟就可以，焖得太久太烂，也会破坏营养素。
    炊事员的工作是一项崇高的、有意义的工作，它同每个人的工作和生活有直接联系。许多炊事员同志已经创造了不少好经验，使同志们吃饱又吃好，这里谈的，只是一些最简单的常识。
