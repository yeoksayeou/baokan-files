This newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 16th: The Hao Xue People's Commune in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, recently organized 1,100 cadres from the entire commune to visit commune members household by household, adopting the approach of simultaneously publicizing the nature and policies of the people's commune and inspecting distribution and commune members' lives. This allowed them to widely solicit opinions from commune members and convene meetings of commune member representatives to collectively resolve various specific issues in current production and commune members' lives. The Jingzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province is widely promoting this experience of the Hao Xue Commune in Jiangling County.

The Hao Xue Commune has more than 12,000 households. During the seven-day door-to-door visits, cadres learned about many opinions and demands from commune members. Regarding distribution, in addition to requesting that cash be distributed to commune members quickly, they also requested that the commune distribute some firewood, glutinous rice, and soybeans for use during the winter and the New Year. Regarding production, they requested that the production responsibility system be established quickly to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible. During the visits, it was also discovered that some commune members lacked cotton-padded clothing, quilts, and housing, and that 460 households had reduced income due to disasters and illnesses.

Based on the opinions of commune members, the commune organized more than 300 reporters and propagandists to widely publicize the nature and various policies of the commune, dispelling some people's misunderstandings. At the same time, it convened meetings of commune member representatives at the brigade level to study and resolve each issue raised by everyone. In this way, a total of sixteen problems were solved in the entire commune, the most important of which were the following six: (1) The entire commune distributed 310,000 yuan in wages, averaging 25 yuan per household; (2) Each commune member household received some glutinous rice, soybeans, firewood, and reserve grain; (3) Through arranging sideline production and public welfare fund subsidies, the problem of reduced income for 460 households was resolved, and the entire commune achieved increased income for every household; (4) The problem of housing shortage for more than 230 households in the entire commune is being solved through building new houses and adjusting housing, and 180 households have already moved into new houses; (5) The entire commune organized more than 140 sewing workers to rush-make cotton-padded clothing and quilts needed by commune members for the winter; (6) Regarding the arrangements for the elderly to spend the winter, each person was issued some oil coupons, and those who wished could start cooking at home. In addition, some specific regulations were made regarding cadre participation in production, field management systems, labor arrangements, and financial management.

After this household-by-household visit, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members was greatly enhanced, greatly promoting production and the consolidation of the commune. Poor peasant commune member Luo Xianxin's family of seven only had one quilt for the winter, and winter cotton-padded clothing had not yet been prepared. The commune promptly helped him solve his difficulties. He said with emotion, "The people's commune is closer than my parents!" At present, the entire commune has set off a high tide of cultivating winter crops. Within five days, all of the 30,000 mu of wheat and 10,000 mu of rapeseed have been inspected and replanted, and more than 9,000 mu have been top-dressed and weeded.

The Hao Xue Commune Party Committee believes that this leadership method of combining household-by-household visits with meetings of commune member representatives is a very good way to strengthen the democratic management of the commune. The Party Committee decided to establish a system of monthly visits in the future.

    江陵郝穴公社找到加强民主管理的一条好办法
    挨户访问和开社员代表会相结合
    宣传政策、征询意见、及时解决群众迫切问题
    本报武汉16日电  湖北省江陵县郝穴人民公社最近组织全社一千一百名干部，采取一边宣传人民公社性质、政策，一边检查分配和社员生活的办法，挨户访问社员，广泛征求社员意见，并召开社员代表会议，集中解决了当前生产和社员生活中各项具体问题。中共湖北省荆州地委正广泛推广江陵县郝穴公社的这一经验。
    郝穴公社共有一万二千多户，干部在历时七天的登门访问中，了解到社员们的许多意见和要求。在分配方面，除了要求很快地把现金分到社员手里外，还要求公社分配一点柴草、糯米、黄豆，作过冬过年用。在生产方面，要求很快把生产责任制建立起来，克服无人负责现象。在访问中，还发现了一些社员缺棉衣、棉被、缺住房，有四百六十户社员因遭灾、害病减少了收入。
    根据了解到的社员意见，公社一方面组织了三百多名报告员、宣传员广泛宣传公社的性质与各项政策，解除有些人的误解；一方面以大队为单位召开社员代表会，将大家提出的意见进行了逐件研究、解决。这样，全社共解决了十六个问题，其中最主要的有如下六个：（1）全社发了工资三十一万元，平均每户分得二十五元；（2）每户社员都分到了一些糯米、黄豆、柴火和机动粮；（3）通过安排副业生产和公益金补助的办法，解决了四百六十户减少收入问题，全社作到了户户增加收入；（4）全社二百三十多户缺住房的问题，正在通过盖新房子和调剂住房等办法解决，已有一百八十户住上了新房子；（5）全社组织一百四十多个缝纫工人，为社员赶做起过冬需要的棉衣、棉被；（6）对老年人过冬的安排，每人发了部分油票，愿意的可以在家里起伙做饭。此外，对干部参加生产、田间管理制度、劳力安排、财务管理等方面，都做出了一些具体规定。
    经过这次逐户访问，广大社员热情高涨，大大地促进了生产和公社的巩固。贫农社员罗仙新一家七口人，只有一床被子过冬，过冬的棉衣还没有准备。公社就及时帮助他解决了困难。他感动地说：“人民公社比我的爹娘还亲！”目前，全社已掀起一个培育冬播作物的高潮，五天内已对三万亩小麦和一万亩油菜，全部进行了查苗补苗，并有九千多亩追了肥、锄了草。
    郝穴公社党委认为：这种挨户访问社员与社员代表会相结合的领导方法，是加强公社民主管理的一个很好办法。党委决定建立今后每月访问一次的制度。
