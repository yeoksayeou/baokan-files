    Early Prevention and Treatment of Wheat Stripe Rust
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shaanxi Branch, Department of Plant Protection
    Wheat stripe rust, also known as yellow rust, is one of the most serious diseases of wheat. Taking all measures to prevent and control stripe rust is of great significance for striving for a greater wheat harvest next year.

    Based on several years of investigation and research on wheat stripe rust, it has been proven that the occurrence of wheat stripe rust in the Guanzhong area is related to the bacteria that overwinter from early spring; the source of bacteria in early spring is related to the source of bacteria on wheat seedlings before winter; the bacteria on wheat seedlings before winter come from early-sown winter wheat areas; and the source of bacteria in early-sown winter wheat areas comes from spring wheat in high-altitude and cold areas and volunteer wheat seedlings from shed spring wheat grains. According to this epidemic law, it can be seen that the prevention and control of wheat stripe rust is not during the period of large-scale outbreaks next year, but to control the autumn seedling stage, the greening stage, and the heading stage, and to carry out prevention and control at each stage.

    The first stage is mainly to completely eliminate the source of disease-causing bacteria on wheat autumn seedlings and prevent it from surviving the winter. First, an inspection must be carried out. When yellow rust spore heaps are found on the leaves, they should be immediately buried in the soil on the spot with tools such as shovels, and the diseased leaves should be cut off. Particular attention should be paid to this stage: a thorough inspection and treatment should be carried out without missing a single plant, and an inspection should be carried out every ten days until the ground freezes. Thorough work in this stage will greatly reduce the incidence of disease in the spring.

    The second stage must eliminate early spring overwintering bacteria and infection centers that have formed after reproduction, and prevent them from spreading. This work should be carried out from about the end of February to the beginning of April. The inspection and treatment methods are the same as in the first stage. When the wheat seedlings are taller, chemical control should be adopted, spraying sodium fluoride, sodium fluosilicate, and other more effective local pesticides.

    The third stage is comprehensive spraying to control the development of rust. When the incidence of disease in the field reaches one in a thousand during the booting stage in early April, prevention and control should be carried out promptly. During this period, pesticide control should focus on effective local pesticides and 0.5 degrees of lime sulfur mixture. After the first spraying, continuous spraying should be carried out three times every seven to ten days.

    Local and chemical pesticides for the prevention and control of stripe rust: 1. Local pesticides Effective against stripe rust are tea seed cake, red smartweed (hot smartweed), ox tongue grass, wild cotton, amaranth, cat's eye, pagoda tree seeds, etc. In addition, 1% saline water (one catty of salt plus one hundred catties of water) also has a preventive effect on rust. 2. Chemical agents. Commonly used are lime sulfur mixture, sodium fluoride, sodium fluosilicate, zineb, etc. Sodium fluosilicate and sodium fluoride are highly effective, but should not be sprayed excessively. It is best used to control rust in the early spring seedling stage of wheat. These chemicals are toxic, so wash your hands thoroughly before eating after spraying. Zineb mainly has a protective effect, and can be sprayed to protect wheat plants that have not been infected during the heading stage.

    及早防治小麦条锈病
    中国农业科学院陕西分院植物保护系
    小麦条锈病，也称黄疸病，是小麦最严重的一种病害。采取一切办法防治条锈病，对争取明年小麦更大丰收，有十分重大的意义。
    根据几年来对小麦条锈病的调查研究，证明关中地区小麦条锈病的发生与早春越冬过来的病菌有关；早春的菌源又与冬前麦苗的发病菌源有关；冬前麦苗上的病菌，又来自早播冬麦地区；早播冬麦地区病源来自高寒地区的春麦和春麦的落粒自生麦苗上。根据这个流行规律，可以看出，防治小麦条锈病，不是在明年大量发病时期，而是要把好秋苗关、返青关和抽穗关，在每一个阶段都要进行防治。
    第一阶段主要是要彻底消灭小麦秋苗上的发病菌源，不让它越过冬天。先是要进行检查，当发现有黄色锈病胞子堆的叶片，就应随即用铲子等工具就地铲土埋掉，并铲断病叶。这一阶段特别应注意的是：要一株不漏的细致检查处理，并每隔十天检查一次，至结冻为止。这一阶段搞的彻底，会大大减少春天的发病率。
    第二阶段必须消灭早春越冬病菌，和经过繁殖已形成的传染中心，不让它扩大传染。约在2月底至4月上旬，应该进行这一工作。其检查、处理方法和第一阶段相同。在麦苗较高的情况下，应采用药剂防治，喷洒氟化钠、氟矽酸钠和其他效果较高的土农药。
    第三阶段是全面喷药，控制锈病的发展。在4月上旬孕穗期内，大田发病病株为千分之一时，就应抓紧进行防治。这一时期用农药防治应以有效土农药和零点五度的石灰硫磺合剂为主。自喷第一次后，每隔七至十天应连续喷治三次。
    防治条锈病的土农药和化学农药：一、土农药  对条锈病有效的有茶子饼、红蓼草（辣蓼）、牛舌头草、野棉花、苋麻、猫儿眼、槐豆子等。此外1％的食盐水（一斤盐加一百斤水）对锈病也有防治作用。二、化学药剂。常用的有石灰硫磺合剂、氟化钠、氟矽酸钠、代森锌等。氟矽酸钠、氟化钠两药药效高，不能喷的过多。最好用于防治早春麦苗期的锈病。药具毒性，喷药后应把手洗净再吃东西。代森锌主要是防护作用，对抽穗期未被感染的麦株可喷药保护。
