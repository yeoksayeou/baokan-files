Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 15th: The National Financial Bureau Chiefs' Meeting was held in Wuhan from November 20th to December 11th. The meeting focused on discussing how to establish and improve the financial management of rural people's communes under the current new situation of people's communalization. The meeting also discussed the financial management of enterprises, continuing to implement the mass line in financial work, and launching red flag movements in financial departments. The national budget targets for 1959 were also discussed at the meeting.
    Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian spoke at the meeting.
    The meeting reviewed the financial work of the past year and concluded that under the leadership of the Party, after the rectification movement, and inspired by the General Line, significant progress has been made in financial work due to the strengthening of political, production, and mass viewpoints of financial cadres. In 1958, national financial revenue greatly increased, ensuring the need for construction funds in the Great Leap Forward and promoting the development of production.
    The meeting believed that the development of the people's commune movement has put forward new tasks for financial work. The focus of financial work in 1959 is to help rural people's communes strengthen financial management, organize forces to investigate and study the accumulation and distribution status of people's communes, and, under the unified deployment of the Party committee, help communes clear their assets, establish and improve commune financial management systems, so as to support the development of commune production from the perspective of improving commune financial management.
    Another important task in 1959 is to strengthen enterprise financial management. The meeting studied ways to improve the management of enterprise working capital and strengthen cost accounting. The meeting emphasized that financial departments must assist various enterprise departments in further strengthening economic accounting and cost management in order to continuously improve the operation and management level of enterprises.
    The meeting criticized the muddled thinking currently present in some financial cadres, such as the belief that after the state implements financial contracting for rural people's communes and investment contracting for capital construction units, there is nothing left for financial departments to do, and economic accounting is no longer needed, etc. The meeting pointed out that after the implementation of financial contracting for rural people's communes and investment contracting for capital construction units, the task of assisting communes and construction units in doing a good job in financial management has become even heavier. Economic accounting not only cannot be abolished, but must be strengthened. Without accounting, it would be impossible to promote the accelerated development of production and construction, nor would it be possible to assess and compare the operation and management levels of various production units.
    In order to do the above work well, the meeting believed that financial cadres must continue to rely on the Party committee, implement the mass line, and establish a realistic and honest work style.
    The meeting studied the national budget targets for 1959 and required financial departments at all levels to first focus on doing a good job in the first quarter of next year, properly arrange and strive to complete the financial revenue and expenditure plan for the first quarter of next year.

    财政厅局长会议讨论财政工作的新任务
    健全人民公社财务管理
    改进企业流动资金的管理和成本核算
    新华社武汉15日电  全国财政厅局长会议自11月20日至12月11日在武汉举行。会议着重讨论了在当前人民公社化的新形势下，如何建立与健全农村人民公社的财务管理工作。会议还讨论了企业财务管理工作，在财政工作中继续贯彻群众路线，以及财政部门开展红旗运动等问题。1959年国家预算指标也在会上作了讨论。
    国务院副总理李先念在会上讲了话。
    会议回顾了一年来的财政工作，认为一年来在党的领导下，经过整风运动，并在总路线的鼓舞下，由于财政干部加强了政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，财政工作有了显著进步。1958年国家财政收入大大增加，保证了大跃进中各项建设资金的需要，促进了生产的发展。
    会议认为，人民公社化运动的发展，给财政工作提出了新的任务。1959年财政工作的重点是帮助农村人民公社加强财务管理工作，组织力量调查研究人民公社的积累和分配状况，并在党委的统一部署下，帮助公社清理财产，建立和健全公社财务管理制度，以便从搞好公社的财务管理工作这个角度来支持公社发展生产。
    1959年的另一项重要任务是加强企业财务管理工作。会议研究了改进企业流动资金管理办法和加强成本核算等问题。会议强调财政部门必须协助各企业部门进一步加强经济核算和成本管理，以不断提高企业的经营管理水平。
    会议批判了目前在有些财政干部中的糊涂思想，如认为在国家对农村人民公社实行财政包干，对基本建设单位实行投资包干以后，财政部门没有什么可做了，经济核算不再需要了等等。会议指出，对农村人民公社实行财政包干、对基本建设单位实行投资包干以后，协助公社和建设单位搞好财务管理的任务更加重了。经济核算不仅不能取消，而且必须加强。没有核算，就不可能促进生产建设的加速发展，也将无法考核和比较各个生产单位的经营管理水平。
    为了做好以上的工作，会议认为，财政干部必须继续依靠党委，贯彻群众路线，并树立实事求是老老实实的工作作风。
    会议研究了1959年国家预算指标，并要求各级财政部门首先抓紧作好明年第一季度的工作，妥善安排并努力完成明年第一季度的财政收支计划。
