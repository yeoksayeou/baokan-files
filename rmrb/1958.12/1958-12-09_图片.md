    Waterwheel, waterwheel, sings "gugugu,"
    Large streams of clear water gush upward,
    Rice seedlings are joyfully lush green,
    Carp are joyfully leaping on the water.
                      [Wall painting of Zhao Zhuang People's Commune, Feng County, Jiangsu]

    水车水车咕咕叫，大股清水往上冒，
    秧苗喜得绿油油，鲤鱼喜得水上跳。
