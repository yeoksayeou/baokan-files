    Life's Joy and Happiness
    Yi Qing
    Dear readers, what are your thoughts after reading the news about the more than 500 cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building who voluntarily went to work in the border regions of our country? I think some people will believe that these comrades did the right thing, recognizing that the greatest joy and happiness in life lies in standing at the most arduous posts in the construction of the motherland and making contributions. Others might think these people are a bit "foolish," thinking: wouldn't it be more comfortable, more joyful, and more happy to work in a big city?
    Why are there different views on the same thing? It depends on a person's outlook on life, that is, their purpose in life. Some people regard a slightly higher personal salary, better food, and better clothing as their goal of struggle, as the joy and happiness of life. People who hold this kind of life purpose will naturally feel that going to work in the border areas is a "bitter" thing. Another type of person's purpose in life is for the motherland and for the people. Therefore, they are happy to go to places with difficult conditions to strive for the happiness of the motherland and the people. Among the more than 500 cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building, there are many such people. They believe that the most arduous and most needed place in the motherland is their most beloved hometown, and they want to build the border region into a socialist happy paradise with the spirit of the Soviet youth who built "Komsomolsk." They not only have lofty ideals, but they also inextricably link the needs of the motherland, the needs of the people, and their personal needs. They are not foolish. Is a person who knows how to combine his short life with the development of the entire society, not wasting a minute or a drop of blood, to promote social progress, smart or foolish? The readers will answer. People often say: "Dedicate youth to the motherland." This sentence should not be understood as: in order to serve the motherland, one must sacrifice the individual, as if the individual and the motherland are opposed. Of course not. Individualists can also shine, but their light can only shine on a small area, as small as the tip of their own nose. Individuals who are combined with the motherland and the people will have their radiance illuminate a historical stage. What kind of people are truly happy, joyful, and free? They are those noble people who have abandoned low-level tastes, those who truly understand their purpose in life.
    The reason why these cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building have this noble style is inseparable from their nearly one year of labor training. In their joint labor with the peasants, they were moved by the peasants' hard work, endurance, and unwavering will to transform their hometowns. They realized that it was shameful not to overcome their past bourgeois individualism. When they worked hard together with the peasants and achieved labor results, they felt great joy, which made them re-recognize the true meaning of hardship and happiness. In the crucible of labor, their revolutionary will, unafraid of difficulties and hardships, was tempered, which gave them the courage and confidence to undertake the task of building the border region. The facts once again vividly illustrate the correctness of the Party's policy of sending cadres down to participate in labor. In the future, with the continued implementation of this policy, more and more cadres from intellectual backgrounds will become like them, people with noble styles.
    Nearly a year of labor is a good exercise for an intellectual who has not undergone the test of actual struggle, but "steel is made by a hundred refinements." To become a high-quality steel, this exercise should be said to be just a beginning. We hope that all intellectual cadres can consciously train themselves, regard the interests of the motherland and the interests of the people as their own interests, truly breathe the same air and share the same pulse with the working people, like a drop of water dripping into the sea, completely integrated, and regard the completion of any arduous struggle task entrusted by the motherland and the people as the greatest joy and happiness in life. By then, they will become broad-minded and happy people who can do whatever they want without overstepping the socialist norms. They will not only be the happiest and most joyful people, but also the most free people.

    人生的快乐与幸福 
    怡清
    亲爱的读者，当你读完第一机械工业部五百多名下放干部自觉自愿地奔赴祖国边疆工作的消息时，有什么感想呢？我想，一种人会认为这些同志做得对，他们认识到在祖国建设中，站在最艰苦的岗位上，并有所贡献，是人生最大的快乐和幸福。另一种人认为这些人有些“傻气”，他们想：在大城市里工作不更舒服些、更快乐些、更幸福些吗？
    对于同样一件事情，为什么有不同的看法呢？这取决于一个人的人生观，也就是他生活的目的。有些人把个人工资多一点，吃得好点，穿得好点，作为他奋斗的目的，当作人生的快乐和幸福。抱着这种生活目的的人，对于去边疆工作，自然会感到是“苦”事了。另一种人生活的目的，是为了祖国，为了人民，因此，他们乐于到条件艰苦的地方去为祖国、为人民的幸福而奋斗。第一机械工业部五百多名下放干部当中，就有很多这样的人，他们认为：祖国最艰苦、最需要的地方，就是他们最亲爱的故乡，他们要以苏联青年建设“共青城”的精神，把边疆建成社会主义的幸福乐园。他们不仅仅有崇高的理想，他们把祖国的需要，人民的需要，和他们个人的需要，血肉不可分割地凝结在一起。他们并不傻。一个人懂得把自己短促的生命同整个社会发展结合起来，不浪费一分钟、一滴血，用以推动社会前进，这样的人是聪明，还是傻呢？读者是会作出答案的。人们常说：“把青春献给祖国”。对于这句话，不能作这样的理解：为了祖国，就要牺牲个人，好像个人和祖国是对立的。当然不是这样，个人主义者也可以发光的，他的光只能照到自己的鼻子尖那么一小块地方，同祖国、同人民结合的个人，他的光华将照亮一个历史阶段，真正愉快、幸福和自由的人，是怎样的人呢？是那些抛弃了低级趣味的高尚的人，是真正懂得自己生活目的的人。
    第一机械工业部这些下放干部所以具有这种崇高的风格，是和他们将近一年的劳动锻炼分不开的。他们在和农民共同劳动中，为农民的吃苦耐劳、坚韧不拔地改造自己家乡的意志所感动。他们认识到不克服自己过去的资产阶级个人主义思想是可耻的。当他们和农民共同艰苦奋斗，并获得了劳动成果时，他们感到了巨大的快乐，这使他们重新认识到了苦与乐的真实的意义。在劳动的溶炉中，锻炼了他们不畏艰难困苦的革命意志，这就使他们有胆量、有信心担负建设边疆的任务。事实又一次生动地说明了党的下放劳动锻炼政策的正确。今后，随着这一政策的继续贯彻，将会有越来越多的知识分子出身的干部，成为像他们一样的具有高尚风格的人。
    将近一年的劳动，对一个没有经过实际斗争考验的知识分子来说，是一个很好的锻炼，但是“千锤百炼始成钢”，要成一块优质钢，这一锻炼，应当说还只是一个开始。我们希望所有的知识分子干部能自觉地锻炼自己，把祖国的利益、人民的利益作为自己的利益，与劳动人民真正呼吸相通，脉搏相连，像一滴水滴在大海里，完全溶和在一起，把完成任何祖国和人民所交付的艰难困苦的斗争任务，当作一生最大的快乐和幸福。到那时，他们将会成为随心所欲而不逾社会主义之矩的胸襟开阔、心情舒畅的人。他们将不仅是最幸福最愉快的人，而且是最自由的人。
