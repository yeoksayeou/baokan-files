Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st: The Executive Committee of the World Peace Council, after holding a meeting in Helsinki from December 19th to 20th, issued a statement.

The statement announced that a special session of the World Peace Council would be held in May next year to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement. On February 21st next year, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council will hold a meeting in Moscow to study relevant issues of various countries.

The statement said that the world peace movement can now proudly estimate its achievements, and the world peace movement occupies an important position among the peace forces preventing war. It has grown stronger and continues to grow stronger.

The statement continued: "People of all countries are still threatened by atomic war. In Europe, this danger is even more obvious. Although the West has undertaken the obligation to demilitarize Germany, they are turning it into a huge military force in Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has indicated that it is determined to base its entire strategy on the use of nuclear weapons. Such weapons are stored everywhere on the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. The new German Bundeswehr, commanded by senior officers of the Hitler army, is full of revengeful sentiments, and the political leaders of the Federal Republic are demanding revisions of the borders. The intolerable situation in Berlin is the result of this policy, which increases the danger in Central Europe."

The statement said that for European security and world peace, this situation must be resolved quickly. To achieve this goal, the World Peace Council will continue to demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the two Germanys.

The statement pointed out that the military bases established by the United States around the world, equipped with atomic weapons, are a permanent threat to the security of the people of all countries. Certain new bilateral or multilateral treaties that have been signed or are being prepared will further aggravate the dependent status of the people of many countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.

The statement said: "Peace forces must redouble their efforts to force the United States to withdraw its troops from China's territory of Taiwan and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in order to ease tensions in the region.

"Peace forces should also take action to force the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea.

"Peace forces must support the Japanese people's struggle against foreign military bases, nuclear weapons, and the planned revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.' We must step up solidarity with the African people, who are moving towards the final elimination of colonial shackles, especially the Algerian people, who have suffered from the cruel disaster of war for many years."

    世界和平理事会执委会发表声明
    和平力量再接再厉反对战争威胁
    明年五月将召开特别会议
    庆祝世界和平运动十周年
    新华社布拉格21日电  世界和平理事会执行委员会12月19日到20日在赫尔辛基举行会议之后，发表了一项声明。
    声明宣布，明年5月将召开世界和平理事会特别会议，来庆祝世界和平运动十周年。明年2月21日世界和平理事会常务委员会将在莫斯科举行会议，研究世界各国有关的问题。
    声明说，世界和平运动现在可以自豪地估计它所取得的成就，在阻止战争的和平力量中间，世界和平运动占着重要的地位。它已经壮大起来，并且继续不断地壮大。
    声明接着说：“各国人民仍然受到原子战争的威胁。在欧洲，这种危险更加明显。虽然西方承担了使德国非军事化的义务，但是它们却正在把它变成欧洲的一个巨大军事力量。北大西洋公约组织已经表明，它决心要把它的全部战略建立在使用核武器的基础上。在德意志联邦共和国的领土上到处都储存有这种武器。由希特勒军队的高级军官指挥的新的德国国防军充满了报复的情绪，联邦共和国的政治领袖们在要求修改边界。柏林的不能容忍的局势就是这种政策的结果，这种局势增加了中欧的危险。”
    声明说，为了欧洲安全和世界和平，必须迅速解决这种局面。为了实现这一目的，世界和平理事会将继续要求一切外国军队从两个德国撤退。
    声明指出，美国在世界各地建立的配置有原子武器的军事基地，是对各国人民安全的永久威胁。已经签订的或者正在准备中的某些新的双边条约或多边条约，将更加加重亚洲、中东和拉丁美洲的许多国家人民的依附地位。
    声明说：“和平力量必须再接再厉，迫使美国从中国领土台湾撤军，停止干涉中国内政，以缓和这个地区的紧张局势。
    “和平力量也应当采取行动，来迫使驻在南朝鲜的外国军队撤退。
    “和平力量必须支持日本人民为反对外国军事基地、核武器和计划中的修改日美‘安全条约’而进行的斗争。必须加紧声援正在向着最终摆脱殖民主义桎梏的道路上迈进的非洲人民，特别是许多年来一直遭受残酷战争灾难的阿尔及利亚人民。”
