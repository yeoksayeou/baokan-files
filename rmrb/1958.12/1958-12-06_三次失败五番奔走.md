    Three Failures and Five Errands
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
    De Gaulle has been gambling his fate on the Algerian question. But in just a few months, this "unlucky" general has suffered three failures in a row.
    Everyone knows that the people who "approved" De Gaulle's rise to power during the French "referendum" were very complex. Apart from the extreme right wing, many harbored illusions or were intimidated—"If De Gaulle does not come to power, there will be a civil war." One of the illusions was that De Gaulle's rise to power might end the Algerian war. In September of this year, the Provisional Government of Algeria proposed negotiations with the French authorities. De Gaulle delayed for a long time and was finally forced to reply. But this reply was tantamount to demanding the unconditional surrender of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. In essence, De Gaulle rejected the peace proposal of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria and insisted on continuing the colonial war. Because of this, many French people have awakened and recognized De Gaulle's true colors. De Gaulle's "prestige" (if he still has some bewitching and deceptive "prestige") has been reduced by at least 10%. This is De Gaulle's first failure on the Algerian question.
    The real pillars of the De Gaulle regime are the most reactionary large monopoly financial groups in the French ruling class, the wealthy French residents who have moved to Algeria, the fascist soldiers who have seized great power in the long colonial war (such as Salan and Massu), and all kinds of chauvinists and colonialists. All these "various characters" are the class basis of the De Gaulle regime. Among these people, most have huge wealth in Algeria. For example, the Paris Mirabaud Bank consortium controls the "Algeria Company," which in turn controls a series of banks and enterprises, grasping the economic lifeline of Algeria. Former parliamentarian Georges Blachette, known as the wealthiest person in the last French National Assembly, earns more than 20 million pounds in profit from Algeria every year. Needless to say, these people are completely united in "defending" their interests in Algeria and continuing to intensify the enslavement of the Algerian people. However, how can this goal be achieved better and more effectively? There are different opinions on this. Some people in the extreme right wing demand a radical solution to the Algerian question: further expand the Algerian war, completely "destroy" the Algerian national liberation movement, and annex Algeria as a province of France, etc. Another part of the people, mainly certain monopoly capital groups, given the hopelessness of ending the war in the short term, advocate taking a combination of hard and soft tactics to divide the Algerian people, thereby creating a relatively "peaceful" environment for them to "develop" the Sahara Desert (which contains rich oil and mineral resources) and carry out various economic plunder. Since there are two different opinions (of course, not essentially different) within the ruling group, De Gaulle is not easy to deal with. If he obeys this side, he will offend the other side. Let us recall the events that took place in the "Committee of Public Safety" in Algeria (the headquarters for launching the coup in Algeria) in October.
    In order to conduct a deceptive "election" in Algeria, De Gaulle ordered a group of fascist soldiers such as Massu to withdraw from the "Committee of Public Safety" in October, "separating the military from the government," to show "democracy." The fascist soldiers expressed great dissatisfaction with this, and they attempted to organize a "general strike" in Algeria, and even planned to launch a second coup to force De Gaulle to "withdraw his order." Only later did they fear isolation and dare not take this risk, so they "reeled back from the brink" and reluctantly compromised with De Gaulle. The French bourgeois newspapers touted this event as De Gaulle's "victory." In fact, it was like a mute eating coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness. De Gaulle's "prestige" has been further reduced by 20%.
    The inability to reconcile the contradictions within the ruling group on the Algerian question is the second failure De Gaulle has encountered.
    The third, and even greater failure, was the so-called "election" held in Algeria on November 30. This deception was carefully arranged by De Gaulle, for example, he expanded the number of Algerian deputies and made Algerian women also "enjoy" the right to vote, etc. De Gaulle's original purpose was to use this deception to divide the Algerian national liberation movement and elect some so-called liberals or middle-of-the-roaders; then, to deal with these people and negotiate a "solution" to the Algerian question. This is why, when De Gaulle replied to the peace proposal of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, he only proposed negotiating the issue of a "ceasefire" and did not mention the future of Algeria at all. However, this "election" was resisted by all strata of Algerian society. In most electoral districts, all candidates were elected, because the number of candidates was so small that there was no need to "compete" or "elect." These dozens of Algerian deputies, apart from their skin color, were no different from De Gaulle's followers. What problems can De Gaulle solve by holding "negotiations" with these unrepresentative "representatives," the puppets he has molded?
    During the "referendum," the percentage of Algerians who "approved" De Gaulle's constitution was even higher than in mainland France. De Gaulle and his disciples were very proud of this, saying it was a "great victory." However, what practical significance does this "high percentage" created by the bayonets of 600,000 troops have?
    The failures De Gaulle has encountered in Algeria are becoming more and more serious. Of course, he has not given up. On December 3, the third day after the National Assembly elections, he went to Algeria again. This is his fifth visit since he came to power. There is no doubt that he will play some tricks again, for example, transferring the fascist soldier Salan away from Algeria and replacing him with a civilian official; or, holding a preliminary negotiation with the Algerian "deputies," etc. However, the more tricks De Gaulle plays on the Algerian question, the more disastrous his future failures will be.
    De Gaulle relied on the military coup in Algeria to climb to power. Sooner or later, he will fall from power on the Algerian question.

    三次失败五番奔走
    本报记者  潘非
    戴高乐一直在把自己的命运押在阿尔及利亚问题上进行赌博。但在短短几个月中，这位“流年不佳”的将军，已经一连遭受到三次失败。
    谁都知道，在法国“公民投票”时“赞成”戴高乐上台的人，是十分复杂的。除极右派外，很多人抱有幻想，或者是受到恫吓——“不让戴高乐上台就会发生内战”。幻想之一就是戴高乐上台后有可能结束阿尔及利亚战争。今年9月间，阿尔及利亚临时政府提出和法国当局进行谈判。戴高乐拖延了许久，最后被迫作了答复。但这一答复，无异是要阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府无条件投降。实质上，戴高乐拒绝了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的和平建议，坚持要把殖民战争打下去。由于这样，很多的法国人清醒了过来，认识了戴高乐的本来面目。戴高乐的“威望”（如果说他还有点儿蛊惑人心的欺骗性“威望”的话）至少打了个九折。这是戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上的第一个失败。
    戴高乐政权的真正支柱，是法国统治集团中最反动的大垄断财团，移居在阿尔及利亚的富有的法国居民，在长期的殖民战争中攫得了极大权力的法西斯军人（如萨兰、马絮之流），以及形形色色的沙文主义者和殖民主义者。所有这些“各色人等”，便是戴高乐政权的阶级基础，在这些人中，大都在阿尔及利亚拥有巨大的财富。例如，巴黎一米拉波银行财团控制着“阿尔及利亚公司”，这一公司又控制着一系列的银行和企业，掌握着阿尔及利亚的经济命脉。前议员乔治·勃兰西特，被称为上届法国国民议会中的最富裕者，每年从阿尔及利亚获得的利润达二千万英镑以上。这些人在“保卫”他们在阿尔及利亚的利益、继续加紧奴役阿尔及利亚人民这一点上，用不着说，是完全一致的。但是，怎样才能更好、更有效地达到这一目的？这却有不同的见解。极右派中有些人要求大刀阔斧地处理阿尔及利亚问题：进一步扩大阿尔及利亚战争，彻底“摧毁”阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动，把阿尔及利亚并吞为法国的一省，等等。而另一部分人，主要是某些垄断资本集团，鉴于短期内结束战争之无望，故主张采取软硬兼施的办法，分化阿尔及利亚人民，从而创造一个比较“和平”的环境，便于他们“开发”撒哈拉沙漠（那儿蕴藏着丰富的石油和矿产），及进行种种经济掠夺。既然在统治集团中存在着两种不同的意见（当然不是本质上的），戴高乐就不太好应付了。他顺从了这一方，就会得罪另一方。不妨回忆一下10月间在阿尔及利亚的“救国委员会”（在阿尔及利亚举行政变的司令部）中所发生的事件。
    戴高乐为了在阿尔及利亚进行欺骗性的“选举”，于10月间命令马絮等一批法西斯军人撤出“救国委员会”，“军政分家”，以表“民主”。法西斯军人对此表示极大不满，他们曾企图在阿尔及利亚组织“总罢工”，甚至计划策动第二次政变，胁迫戴高乐“收回成命”。只是后来他们害怕孤立，不敢冒这风险，才“悬崖勒马”，勉强同戴高乐妥协。法国资产阶级报纸，把这一事件吹嘘成为戴高乐的“胜利”。其实是哑吧吃黄连，有苦说不出。戴高乐的“威望”，又打了个八扣。
    无法调和统治集团在阿尔及利亚问题上的矛盾，是戴高乐遭遇到的第二个失败。
    第三次，也是更大一次的失败，是11月30日在阿尔及利亚举行的所谓“选举”。这一骗局，是戴高乐煞费心思布置的，例如，他扩大了阿尔及利亚籍议员的名额，使阿尔及利亚的妇女也“享有”选举权等等。戴高乐的原来目的，是想通过这一骗局来分化阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动，选出一些所谓自由主义分子或中间人士；然后，再同这些人打交道，谈判“解决”阿尔及利亚问题。这就是为什么戴高乐在回答阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的和平建议时，他只提出谈判“停火”问题，而根本不提阿尔及利亚的前途问题，但是，这次“选举”受到了阿尔及利亚各阶层的抵制，在大多数选区中，所有的候选人都一律当选，因为候选人寥若晨星，既用不着“竞”，也用不着“选”，这几十个阿尔及利亚籍议员，除了肤色不同以外，同戴高乐分子没有任何区别。戴高乐同这些毫无代表性的“代表”、他所塑制出来的傀儡举行“谈判”，能解决什么问题呢？
    在“公民投票”时，阿尔及利亚“赞成”戴高乐宪法的百分比，甚至高于法国本土。戴高乐和他的门徒们对此甚为得意，说这是个“伟大的胜利”。但是，依靠六十万大军的刺刀制造出来的这个“高比率”，有什么实际意义呢？
    戴高乐在阿尔及利亚遭遇到的失败，一次比一次严重。当然，他还没有死心。在国民议会选举结束后的第三天，12月3日，他又到阿尔及利亚访问去了。这是他上台以后的第五次访问。毫无疑问，他又会耍一些花样的，例如，把法西斯军人萨兰调离阿尔及利亚，用一个文官来代替他的职务；或者，同阿尔及利亚的“议员”作一次初步的谈判等等。但是，戴高乐在阿尔及利亚问题上的花样愈搞得多，未来的失败也就更惨。
    戴高乐是依靠阿尔及利亚的军事政变爬上台来的。迟早，他又会在阿尔及利亚问题上滚下台去。
