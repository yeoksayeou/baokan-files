Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 26th. A winter crop field management movement focusing on topdressing and irrigation has been launched in various parts of Anhui Province. More than 1.8 million members of more than 100,000 field management professional teams across the province have applied topdressing to more than 20 million mu of wheat and rapeseed, winter-irrigated 6 million mu of wheat, and cleared ditches and weeded 4 million mu of wheat fields.

The planting density of wheat in Anhui Province this year is very high, generally about 40 jin of seeds per mu, and the density of rapeseed and other winter crops has also exceeded that of previous years. Recently, there has been no rain in various places, and some fields have experienced drought, so it is particularly necessary to immediately launch a topdressing and irrigation movement.

Many people's communes combine topdressing and irrigation, giving full play to the superiority of the communes. In the two regions of Lu'an and Anqing, more than 1.5 million mu of wheat and rapeseed fields have adopted the above methods to prevent freezing and conserve moisture.

In addition to having professional teams for field management, implementing field management measures to the fields, responsibility to the team, and regular inspection and acceptance systems, many people's communes in various places have recently redeployed manpower throughout the commune to carry out a blitz of field management activities. Fangji Township in Funan County also launched a labor competition for fertilization and winter irrigation, mobilizing 17,500 people throughout the township to irrigate more than 16,000 mu of fields in one day.

    措施到田防冻保墒
    新华社合肥26日电  一个以追肥、灌溉为主的越冬作物田间管理运动，已在安徽各地展开。全省十万多个田间管理专业队的一百八十多万队员，已给二千多万亩小麦和油菜施了追肥，对六百万亩小麦进行了冬灌，并给四百万亩麦田清了沟、锄了草。
    安徽省今年播种的小麦密度都很高，一般每亩下种籽四十斤左右，油菜等其他越冬作物的密植程度也超过了往年。最近各地没有下雨，部分田已发生旱象，所以立即开展一次追肥、灌溉运动，就显得特别需要。
    很多人民公社追肥和灌溉是结合进行的，发挥了公社的优越性。六安和安庆两个专区，已有一百五十多万亩麦田和油菜田采取了上述的办法，进行了防冻保墒。
    各地人民公社除了有专业队伍进行田间管理，实行了田间管理措施到田、责任到组、定期检查验收等制度以外，近来还有不少社在全社范围内重新调配了人力，开展了田间管理的突击活动。阜南县方集乡还开展了施肥、冬灌的劳动竞赛，全乡发动了一万七千五百人，在一天内浇田一万六千多亩。
