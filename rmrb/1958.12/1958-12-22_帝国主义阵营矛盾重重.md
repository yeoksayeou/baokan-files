Imperialist Camp Riddled with Contradictions
潘非 Su Lan

A month ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council Ministerial Meeting passed a resolution: all member states should work together to launch an artificial satellite into space before 1960 to show that they are "united" not only on land and sea, but also in space.

The rich imagination expressed in this resolution cannot but arouse people's "admiration." However, whether there is a satellite symbolizing "unity" in the sky, or it is just a blown-up balloon, it cannot change the fact that the life-and-death struggle among imperialists has reached an unprecedentedly fierce degree today. This struggle is not only concentratedly exposed within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but also unfolds more widely on the periphery of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	The Struggle for Spheres of Influence

The struggle of imperialism outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is first and foremost manifested in the scramble for spheres of influence. This struggle is very sharp and is becoming increasingly fierce. This development is inevitable. Because from a global perspective, the strength and unity of the socialist camp prevent imperialism from venturing to touch this copper wall. From within the imperialist group, due to the invasion of the economic crisis, the increasing severity of market issues, and the further disintegration of the colonial system—all of this inevitably leads them to direct their spearheads at each other's spheres of influence.

The victory of the Iraqi people was a fatal blow to Britain, which had huge colonial interests in the Middle East. The Faisal dynasty, which had been fostered by Britain for a long time, was overthrown, and the reactionary Iraq, which served as a tool of colonialism, became revolutionary Iraq against colonialism. The Baghdad Pact has existed in name only, and Britain's position in the southern Arabian Peninsula—Aden, Oman, and Lahej—is even more shaken. As British colonial rule in the Middle East faces total collapse, the United States is stepping up its activities to further weaken British influence in the region. Recently, the United States signed bilateral military treaties with Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey respectively. This is another effort by the United States to squeeze out Britain's influence in the Middle East following the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Relying on so-called economic "aid," the United States is quite effectively encroaching on Britain's positions. The Colombo Plan is a powerful example. This plan was originally initiated by Britain, but now it has fallen into the hands of the United States, becoming a lever for the United States to attack Britain's sphere of influence in Southeast Asia. At the Colombo Plan meeting held in Seattle on November 10, Britain only sent a Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to attend, while the United States was represented by Eisenhower and Dulles in person. Eisenhower also made a grand promise to give "full support" to the Colombo Plan. The reason why Eisenhower became the real master of the Seattle meeting was determined by the fact that from the establishment of the Colombo Plan in 1950 to last year, the US government provided $3.9 billion in "aid" to the region in various ways, while the British government provided less than $200 million in "aid" during the same period.

However, it is unimaginable that those imperialists, such as Britain, France, and Germany, who once dominated the world, can always obediently endure this squeeze from the United States. Especially after the East wind further prevailed over the West wind this year, and the prestige of the United States greatly declined, the Western European imperialist countries seized the opportunity to fight back against the United States, while also striving to expand their own influence.

At present, West Germany has emerged in the struggle for spheres of influence, becoming a stubborn opponent of Britain, France, and even the United States. On the one hand, West Germany uses its strong economic strength to infiltrate capital into the spheres of influence of Britain and France. On the other hand, after the United States suffered a defeat in its armed aggression in the Middle East this year, it colluded with Italy to prepare to take the opportunity to fill the "vacuum" of the United States in the Middle East. When West German Economics Minister Erhard visited Southeast Asia not long ago, West Germany's ambition was revealed. At that time, the West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" wrote: West Germany "must supplement the space created by the failure of colonialist policies and American aid policies and provide economic cooperation to Asian countries." Now, in the special fund established by the Organization for European Economic Cooperation for the development of "backward areas," West German capital accounts for as much as 25%.

Britain is suffering from the double squeeze of the United States and West Germany. In order to cope with this pressure, Britain has made considerable efforts. At the end of last year, when Britain saw the leadership of the United States shaken, it took the initiative to put forward the slogan of "interdependence." Britain at that time wanted to seize part of the power of the United States by taking advantage of the crisis of the United States, and at the same time, use its "alliance" with the United States to oppress and squeeze out the Western European continental countries. However, the result was met with strong resistance from West Germany. In May of this year, when the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization met in Copenhagen, Britain tried its best to shift the topic of discussion to "economic aspects," with the aim of strengthening its competitive position while the United States was in an economic crisis. After the United States suffered successive defeats in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, Britain's challenge to the United States became even more blatant. On October 24, British Marshal Montgomery severely criticized the United States for "trying to eliminate" the interests of Western European colonial countries in Asia and Africa, and advocated that Britain should play a more important role. However, on the other hand, it cannot be ignored that although Britain is engaged in fierce competition with the United States, in some occasions they collude with each other to jointly attack France, the weakest imperialist country. For example, last year, the United States and Britain jointly transported arms to Tunisia regardless of France's opposition. This year, the United States and Britain took advantage of the French bombing of Sakiet in Tunisia to carry out "mediation" activities. In the "mediation," the United States and Britain provoked Tunisia's dissatisfaction with France, and at the same time used this dissatisfaction to force France to make concessions, in an attempt to further squeeze out France and infiltrate North Africa.

North Africa is the last pillar supporting the French colonial empire. How can French monopoly capital be willing to be squeezed out by the United States and Britain? Although the "mediation" of the United States and Britain forced the government of Guy Mollet to step down, it forced de Gaulle to come out. This representative of French extreme colonialism and fascist forces, as soon as he came to power, tried his best to strongly resist the oppression of the United States and Britain, and tried every means to revitalize the "status" of the French colonial empire.

At present, the struggle between imperialist countries for spheres of influence is far from over. And from numerous signs, a new struggle of mutual encroachment in the Asia-Africa region is brewing and being deployed. This is a new conspiracy by imperialism to enslave the people of Asia and Africa. This ambition of imperialism has encountered the resistance of the increasingly high tide of national independence movements in the Asia-Africa region, which is an insurmountable obstacle for imperialism.

	The Shaking of American “Leadership”

The fierce struggle of imperialist countries outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot but be reflected within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In fact, the contradiction of imperialist scramble for spheres of influence has become a huge impact force, which is shaking the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, making this aggressive group form a situation of disintegration.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established under such a "theory": Western European countries do not have the strength to resist the "attack" from the Soviet Union. They must concentrate and organize their "defense forces" and place them under the "protection" of American atomic bombs. However, the myth of American "protection" of Western Europe has been shattered by facts, because the so-called possibility of the Soviet Union "attacking" Western Europe is fundamentally non-existent. Moreover, since the red artificial satellite went to the sky last year, it has proved that the military science and technology of the United States has lagged far behind, and it is fundamentally impossible to rely on it to "defend" Western Europe. The emergence of this situation has greatly shaken the American "leadership" over the Western world. Thus, a series of fierce contradictions and struggles between the United States to strengthen control and its "allies" to counter control have unfolded within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

When the imperialist camp is further weakened and tends to split apart, the United States beats the drum of anti-Soviet and anti-communist and uses arms expansion and war preparation to tie its increasingly alienated "allies" tightly to its war chariot. This not only worsens the international situation but also weakens the competitiveness of the "allies" in the world market. At the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the end of last year, the United States desperately wanted to install missile bases on the territory of its "allies." But its "allies" have been unenthusiastic about it. Denmark and Norway have openly refused to establish American missile bases. Many countries have also expressed great interest in establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. So far, only Britain and Italy have agreed to the American request. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Paris a few days ago, the United States brought up the old matter again and again and advocated further arms expansion. In order to create an atmosphere conducive to arms expansion, Dulles also made a big fuss about the West Berlin issue and the situation in the Far East at the meeting, clamoring about "Soviet threats" and "threats from Communist China," and so on. But in the end, Dulles' clamor neither concealed the quarrels within the aggressive group nor made the "allies" more enthusiastic about the American arms expansion plan. Many countries at the meeting said that they were economically "unable to afford" and were unwilling to follow the United States to engage in large-scale military preparations. And France was even "passive" about this plan and took a "non-cooperative" attitude towards some other "major military measures." The American clamor for arms expansion and war preparation obviously did not achieve the expected results.

The shameful failure of the United States' aggression in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait has once again seriously hit its "leadership" over the Western world. The United States' sending troops to Lebanon without consulting its "allies" caused widespread dissatisfaction within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In response to this arbitrariness of the United States, West Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Nordic countries have repeatedly put forward the request to "strengthen political consultation." At the same time, French Prime Minister de Gaulle wrote to the heads of state of the United States and Britain, requesting that France should have a say when the United States is "deploying world strategy." Soon, British Marshal Montgomery also delivered a speech on October 24 severely criticizing the United States, and he even demanded that the American general who is now serving as the Supreme Allied Commander be replaced by a European. This direct challenge from the "allies" angered the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, American General Norstad, who bluntly rejected Montgomery's request and retorted.

However, things have not passed. At this North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris meeting, France insisted on breaking into the American and British "leadership core." In order to achieve this goal, France made a big fuss on the issue of establishing missile bases in the United States, insisting on having the right to supervise nuclear missiles. And it is also unwilling to make concessions to Britain on the issue of the "free trade area." Dulles and Lloyd held talks with de Gaulle respectively, but the "differences were still deep." In order to deal with de Gaulle's request to share leadership, Dulles said at the recent Paris meeting that he could strengthen "political consultation," in order to appease the dissatisfaction of other "allies" and isolate France. But now it seems that France is not ready to back down.

The interests of small countries have been openly trampled on within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West Germany demanded that Denmark's armed forces be transferred from the Nordic system of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Central European system and placed under the command of Nazi General Speidel. Within this military group, Greece's legitimate demands on Cyprus have been attacked. In the dispute between Greece and Britain, the United States not only supported the latter, but also attempted to turn the island into a military base of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under American control. Iceland's territorial waters have been openly violated by its "ally" Britain. All of this concentrates on reflecting the opposition between large and small countries within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	The Competition in the Western European Market

The uneven development of imperialist countries is the main root of the increasingly fierce contradictions between them. While old colonial countries such as Britain and France have been greatly weakened, West Germany has continued to grow economically and militarily, becoming the "strength faction" in Western Europe. This has made the struggle within the imperialist group more acute and more complex.

Although West Germany has also seen signs of the growing maturity of the capitalist economic crisis and has been affected by the American economic crisis, its situation is much stronger than that of Britain. In the past four years, British industrial production has remained at its original level, while West Germany has continued to develop.

In the first nine months of this year, British industrial production decreased by 2.1% compared with the same period last year; while West Germany's industrial production in the first ten months of this year increased by 2.6% compared with the same period last year. West Germany's steel and cement production has long exceeded that of Britain, and electricity is also close to the level of Britain. In the first three quarters of this year, West Germany's foreign trade surplus reached US$1 billion (an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year); Britain's exports are declining, and the issue of foreign markets has never been so acute. In the European Payments Union, West Germany has always been the largest creditor (the current surplus is US$970 million); Britain is often the largest debtor (the current deficit is US$350 million). The US-British policy of reviving German militarism has also led to the rapid growth of West Germany's military strength. According to the Pentagon's timetable, it is expected that by 1960, West Germany's troops will double compared with now and will be equipped with nuclear weapons.

The rise of West Germany has changed the balance of power among Western European imperialist countries and is brewing new combinations. From the situation in the past year, it can be seen that West Germany has the upper hand in the struggle for leadership over Western European continental countries than Britain. Among them, West Germany and France are moving towards a new alliance. West Germany is trying its best to kick Britain away and grab the second place in the Western world. It is very dissatisfied with the United States' bringing Britain into the "leadership core" this year. And France also wants to use the strength of West Germany to strengthen its position in the struggle with the United States and Britain. Due to this situation, Bonn and Paris have temporarily relegated the contradictions between the two sides to a secondary position in order to use each other and jointly deal with the United States and Britain. In the recent period, West Germany and France have often echoed each other politically; economically, from the "Coal and Steel Community" to the "Common Market," it marks the further combination of the monopoly groups of the two countries; militarily, France and West Germany cooperate to manufacture atomic weapons to counter the US-British monopoly on nuclear weapons production.

Britain has always pursued a so-called "maintaining the balance" policy in Western Europe: curbing the growth of West German influence, hindering the restoration of France's international status, and preventing France from forming an alliance with West Germany. But it seems that Britain's policy has not achieved much.

The contradictions between France, West Germany, and Britain are currently concentrated in the struggle between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area." The "Common Market" excludes Britain from the Western European market, ensuring that West Germany dominates Western Europe. Moreover, from then on, an anti-British West German-French axis will emerge. In order to resist this situation, Britain has united non-"Common Market" countries to propose to replace the "Common Market" with the "Free Trade Area." This will not only maintain Britain's position in Western Europe, but also make it easier to defeat competitors on the Western European continent, first of all France. This irreconcilable contradiction has brought the product of the American "Marshall Plan"—the Organization for European Economic Cooperation—to the brink of collapse. Everyone knows that the Organization for European Economic Cooperation boasts "establishing free trade and free payment in Europe through economic cooperation among member states." Now, the seventeen member states have split into two groups, excluding each other, and are moving towards the opposite of the purpose boasted by the Organization for European Economic Cooperation.

Due to France's refusal, Britain's "Free Trade Area" plan has in fact become a bubble. Even if the six "Common Market" countries and other capitalist countries in Western Europe reach some kind of trade agreement, it will not be the proposal previously put forward by the British government. However, Britain is obviously not dead yet. On the one hand, it puts on a posture, expressing that it does not hesitate to break with the "Common Market" and accusing France of being the culprit for destroying "economic cooperation" in Western Europe; on the other hand, it does its best to win over West Germany. British Prime Minister Macmillan visited Bonn twice in the previous period, and recently Britain invited West German President Heuss to visit Britain. This is the first time that the highest leader of West Germany has visited Britain since the war. A feature of these visits is that they try their best to boast so-called "British-German friendship." During Heuss's visit to Britain, the British Foreign Secretary deliberately leaked De Gaulle's secret letter requesting the establishment of a "three-headed core" to West Germany to show his favor.

In order to soften France's attitude, Britain asked the United States to participate in mediation on the grounds of "maintaining European unity." When Nixon visited London, Macmillan expressed this hope. But Nixon just shrugged his shoulders and thought that "the matter is of great importance," and pushed the problem to Eisenhower. In fact, the official attitude of the United States has been frankly stated by the "New York Times." It said: "No matter how regrettable we are for the breakdown of the free trade area plan, we should not avoid seeing the historical importance of the establishment of the Common Market. This organization requires a new, lasting political unity in the future. In the end, it will prove to be more important than the economic benefits that seem to be at present." It is obvious that the United States wants to further control Western European countries politically and economically through the leadership of the "Common Market" due to the support of West Germany.

The eleven countries headed by Britain have painstakingly studied countermeasures to resist the "Common Market." Britain once wanted to unite the remaining ten Western European countries to form another "customs union" to compete with the "Common Market." However, most of these countries, except Switzerland, have traditional economic ties with France and West Germany, and they are unwilling to sacrifice their own interests and act as tools of Britain. Britain once proclaimed that it would withdraw from the Organization for European Economic Cooperation. It seems that this is somewhat of a bluff, because the result of doing so is tantamount to giving the economic leadership of Western Europe to West Germany, which is conducive to West Germany's dominance in Western Europe. Britain also proclaimed that it would "take retaliatory measures" and raise tariffs on the six countries. However, this is not a major blow to France and West Germany, and it will deepen the opposition between Britain and the "Common Market," and objectively play a role in consolidating the "Common Market."

Since it cannot economically resist the "Common Market," Britain has turned to political methods to attack the "Common Market" countries. After the negotiations between the six "Common Market" countries and the eleven countries supporting the "Free Trade Area" headed by Britain broke down, British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd personally came out and openly threatened that if Western "cooperation" in the economy is broken, "military and political cooperation" cannot be "completely preserved." Recently, on the eve of the Paris meeting, Britain used the West Berlin issue to put pressure on West Germany in an attempt to force West Germany to make concessions and use this to influence France. West Germany, because it wants to reap the benefits on both sides, is happy to be a "mediator."

But France's opposition attitude has not changed. It even had a head-on clash with Britain at the European Economic Cooperation Sub-Ministerial Council on the 15th, launching a struggle that Western news agencies called an attempt to "drown" competitors. France refused at the meeting Britain's request for the "Common Market" to relax import limits to 3% of national production, breaking the hope of reaching an agreement between the two sides. At the later North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, this contradiction could not be resolved due to the irreconcilable interests of both sides.

The struggle surrounding the "Common Market" issue has not ended. Britain, France, and West Germany will wrestle for several more rounds and will become a fairly long-term struggle. Britain is in a very unfavorable situation in this fight.

It can be seen from this that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not a factor of "uniting" the imperialist group, but a factor of splitting this group. Irreconcilable contradictions have divided the imperialist camp. In this situation, the United States, at the recent Paris meeting, as it has done in the past, beats the drum of anti-Soviet and anti-communist and demands that all countries "unite," but the "unity" said by Dulles and Eisenhower is to place all countries under the control of the United States and consolidate its leadership position in the imperialist group. In fact, the contradictions within the imperialist group are first of all the contradictions between the United States and the Western European countries. If this contradiction has not been prominent recently, it is only because the sharp contradictions such as the "Common Market" are developing, temporarily covering up the former. The US effort to tighten control over Western European countries will inevitably go to the opposite of its wishes.

    帝国主义阵营矛盾重重
    潘非  苏蓝
    一个月以前，北大西洋集团理事会议员会议通过一项决议：各成员国通力协作，争取在1960年以前发射一个人造卫星上天，以表示它们不仅在陆地、海洋和空间是“团结”的，而且在太空也是“团结”的。
    这个决议所表现的丰富的想像力，不能不引起人们的“钦佩”，不过，果真有个象征“团结”的卫星上天也罢，或则它仅是个吹大了的气球也罢，都不可能改变这一事实：帝国主义之间你死我活的斗争，今天已达到了空前激烈的程度，这一斗争不仅集中地暴露于北大西洋集团内部，而且在北大西洋集团的外围更为广泛地展开了。
      势力范围的争夺
    帝国主义在北大西洋集团外部的斗争，首先也是主要的，表现在势力范围的争夺。这斗争十分尖锐，而且日趋激烈。这种发展是必然的。因为从世界范围来看，社会主义阵营的强大和团结，使帝国主义不敢冒险去碰这铜墙铁壁；从帝国主义集团内部来看，由于经济危机的侵袭，市场问题的日趋尖锐，殖民体系的进一步瓦解——这一切，必然导致它们把矛头指向相互的势力范围。
    伊拉克人民的胜利，对于在中东有着巨大的殖民利益的英国，是个致命的打击。由英国长期扶植起来的费萨尔王朝被推翻了，充当殖民主义工具的反动的伊拉克，变成了反殖民主义的革命的伊拉克。巴格达条约已名存实亡，英国在阿拉伯半岛南部——亚丁、阿曼和拉赫杰的地位更加动摇。当英国在中东的殖民统治面临全面崩溃的时候，美国正加紧活动，进一步削弱英国在这一地区的影响。最近，美国分别同巴基斯坦、伊朗和土耳其签订双边军事条约。这是继“艾森豪威尔主义”之后，美国排挤英国在中东势力的又一次努力。
    凭借所谓经济“援助”，美国正颇有成效地节节进迫英国的阵地，科伦坡计划是个有力的例证。这个计划原是英国一手搞起来的，但如今已落于美国的掌握之中，成为美国进攻英国在东南亚势力范围的杠杆。11月10日在西雅图召开的科伦坡计划会议，英国只派了个协办外交事务国务大臣出席，而美国方面则由艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯亲自出马。艾森豪威尔并许下宏愿，表示对科伦坡计划予以“全力支持”。艾森豪威尔所以成为西雅图会议上的真正主人，是由这样一个事实所决定的：从1950年科伦坡计划成立到去年，美国政府以各种方式对该地区提供了三十九亿美元的“援助”，而在同一时期内，英国政府提供的“援助”不及两亿美元。
    但是，不能想像那些过去曾经叱咤一时的英、法、德等帝国主义者，能够始终服服贴贴地忍受美国的这种排挤。特别当今年东风进一步压倒西风，美国威信大大降落之后，西欧的帝国主义国家就更抓紧时机来向美国进行反击，同时又竭力扩张自己的势力。
    目前，争夺势力范围的斗争中，西德已崭露头角，成为英、法甚至美国的顽强对手。西德一方面利用它的雄厚的经济实力把资本渗入英法的势力范围中去；另一方面，今年在美国武装侵略中东遭到失败后，更和意大利勾结一起，准备乘机填补美国在中东的“真空”。不久前西德经济部长艾哈德访问东南亚时，西德的这种野心就显露了。当时西德“法兰克福评论报”曾写道：西德“必须补充由于殖民主义政策和美国援助政策的失败而产生的空间，向亚洲国家提供经济合作。”现在，在欧洲经济合作组织为开发“落后地区”而设立的特别基金中，西德资本所占的份额高达25％。
    英国受着美国和西德的双重的排挤。为了对付这种压力，英国曾经作了不小的努力。去年年底，英国看到美国领导地位动摇时，就主动提出“互相依赖”的口号。英国当时想一方面乘美国之危夺取美国一部分势力，同时反过来又利用它同美国的“联盟”，压迫和排挤西欧大陆国家。但是，结果遭到了西德的强烈反抗。今年5月，北大西洋集团外长在哥本哈根开会时，英国在会上竭力要把讨论的话题转到
  “经济方面”，其目的是想趁美国陷入经济危机之时加强自己的竞争地位。当美国连续在中东和台湾海峡吃了败仗之后，英国向美国的挑战更加露骨。10月24日，英国元帅蒙哥马利严厉指责美国“力图消灭”西欧殖民主义国家在亚洲和非洲的利益，并且鼓吹英国应当起更重要的作用。但是，另一方面，也不能不看到，英国虽然跟美国在进行激烈的竞争，可是在一些场合它们又互相勾结起来共同向最弱的帝国主义国家法国开刀。例如去年美英不顾法国的反对，联合向突尼斯运送军火；今年美英又利用法国轰炸突尼斯的萨基埃特事件竭力进行
  “斡旋”的活动。在“斡旋”中美英一面挑起突尼斯对法国的不满，同时又借口这种不满来压迫法国让步，企图借此进一步排挤法国，渗入北非。
    北非是支撑法国殖民帝国的最后一根支柱了，法国垄断资本对美英的排挤岂能甘心？美英的“斡旋”虽然逼使盖伊阿政府垮了台，但是却逼了个戴高乐出来。这个法国极端殖民主义和法西斯势力的代表，一上台之后就竭力向美英的压迫进行强烈的反抗，千方百计要重振法国殖民帝国的“地位”。
    现在，帝国主义国家争夺势力围范的斗争远没有结束。而且从无数迹象看来，在亚非地区互相倾轧的一场新的斗争，正在酝酿和部署中。这是帝国主义企图奴役亚非人民的新阴谋。帝国主义的这一野心，遇到了亚非地区日益高涨的民族独立运动的反抗，这是帝国主义难以克服的障碍。
    美国“领导地位”的动摇
    帝国主义国家在北大西洋集团外部的激烈的斗争，不能不在北大西洋集团内部有所反映。事实上，帝国主义争夺势力范围的矛盾，已成一股巨大的冲击力量，正在动摇北大西洋集团的基础，使得这个侵略集团内部形成了分崩离析的局面。
    北大西洋集团是在这样一种“理论”下成立起来的：西欧国家没有力量抵御来自苏联的
  “进攻”。它们必须把“防御力量”集中和组织起来，并且置于美国原子弹的“保护”之下。但是，美国“保护”西欧的神话，已经被事实所粉碎了，因为所谓苏联“进攻”西欧的可能性是根本不存在的。而且，自从去年红色人造卫星上天以后，证明美国的军事科学技术已经大大落后，要依靠它来“保卫”西欧也是根本不可能的。这种局面的出现，大大动摇了美国对西方世界的“领导地位”。于是在北大西洋集团内部展开了一系列美国要加强控制和其“盟国”反控制的激烈的矛盾和斗争。
    当帝国主义阵营进一步受到削弱，并趋于四分五裂的时候，美国就擂起反苏反共的大鼓，并且用扩军备战把它日益离心离德的“盟国”紧紧绑在它的战车上。这样既恶化了国际局势，又削弱了“盟国”在世界市场上的竞争能力。在去年年底的北大西洋集团巴黎会议上，美国就拼命要把导弹基地安在它的“盟国”的领土上。但是它的“盟国”一直对之不起劲。丹麦和挪威两国更公开拒绝建立美国的导弹基地。许多国家还表示对建立中欧无原子武器区大有兴趣。到目前为止，仅仅英国和意大利两个国家答应了美国的要求。在前几天巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议上，美国又旧事重提，再三鼓吹进一步扩军。为了造成有利扩军的气氛，杜勒斯又在会上就西柏林问题和远东的局势大做文章，叫嚣“苏联威胁”和“共产党中国的威胁”等等。但是结果杜勒斯的叫嚣既没有掩得住侵略集团内部的争吵，也没有使“盟国”对美国的扩军计划更起劲。许多国家在会上表示经济上“无力负担”而不愿跟着美国去大搞军备。而法国更对这个计划“消极怠工”，同时对其他一些“重大军事措施”也采取“不合作”的态度。美国扩军备战的叫嚷显然并没有取得预期的效果。
    美国在中东和台湾海峡地区进行侵略的可耻失败，使它对西方世界的“领导权”又一次受到严重打击。美国未跟“盟国”商量而出兵黎巴嫩，在北大西洋集团内部引起了普遍的不满。针对美国的这种独断独行，西德、意大利、加拿大和北欧国家不断提出“加强政治磋商”的要求。同时，法国总理戴高乐又写信给美、英首脑，要求美国在“部署世界战略”时，法国应当有发言权。不久，英国元帅蒙哥马利也在10月24日发表了一篇严厉抨击美国的演说，他甚至要求以欧洲人来更换现在担任盟军最高司令的美国将军。“盟国”的这种直接挑战激怒了北大西洋集团军最高司令、美国将军诺斯塔德，他直率拒绝了蒙哥马利的要求，并加以反唇相讥。
    但是，事情并没有过去。在这次北大西洋集团巴黎会议上，法国坚持要打入美、英“领导核心”。为了达到这个目的，法国在美国建立导弹基地问题上大敲竹杠，一定要拥有监督核导弹的权利。并且在“自由贸易区”问题上也不想对英国让步。杜勒斯和劳埃德曾经分别跟戴高乐进行会谈，但是依然“分歧很深”。为了对付戴高乐分享领导权的要求，杜勒斯在最近的巴黎会议上表示可以加强“政治磋商”，借此来平息其他“盟国”的不满，并孤立法国。但是现在看来法国还没有准备退缩的迹象。
    小国的利益在北大西洋集团内受到了公开的蹂躏。西德要求把丹麦的武装力量从北大西洋集团的北欧系统划归中欧系统，置于纳粹将军斯派达尔的指挥之下。在这个军事集团内，希腊对塞浦路斯的正当要求受到打击。美国在希腊和英国的纠纷中不仅支持后者，而且正在企图把这一岛屿变为在美国控制下的北大西洋集团的军事基地。冰岛的领海，遭受到“盟国”英国的公然侵犯。所有这些，集中地反映了北大西洋集团内部大国和小国之间的对立。
      西欧市场的角逐
    帝国主义国家发展的不平衡，是它们之间矛盾日益激烈的主要根源。在英法这些旧的殖民国家大大削弱的同时，西德却在经济上和军事上不断地强大起来。成为西欧的“实力派”。这就使得帝国主义集团内部的斗争更加尖锐和更加复杂。
    西德虽然也已出现了资本主义经济危机日益成熟的征兆，并且受到美国经济危机的影响，但它的情况比起英国来还是强得多。最近四年来，英国的工业生产一直停留在原来的水平，而西德却在不断地发展。
    在今年头九个月中，英国的工业生产比去年同期减少了2.1％；而西德今年头十个月的工业生产却比去年同期增加了2.6％。西德钢和水泥的产量早已超过英国，电力也已接近英国的水平。在今年前三季中，西德的对外贸易结余达十亿美元（比去年同期增加30％）；英国的出口正在下降，国外市场问题从来没有这样尖锐过。在西欧支付同盟中，西德一向是最大的债权国（目前的结余达九亿七千万美元）；英国则往往是最大的债务国（目前的亏欠达三亿五千万美元）。美英复活德国军国主义的政策，使西德的军事力量也在迅速增长。根据五角大楼的时间表，预计到1960年时，西德的部队将比现在增加一倍，并且将配备核子武器。
    西德的崛起，使西欧帝国主义国家间力量的平衡发生变化，并酝酿新的结合。从过去一年的局势中可以看出，在争夺对西欧大陆国家的领导方面，西德是比英国占上风了。其中西德和法国并正在走向一个新的联盟。西德竭力要踢开英国，抢上西方世界第二位的宝座，它对美国今年把英国拉进“领导核心”大为不满。而法国也想借西德的实力来加强它与美英斗争的地位。由于这一情况使得波恩和巴黎把双方的矛盾暂时退居次要地位，以便相互利用，共
  同对付美英。最近一个时期来，西德和法国在政治上，常常彼此呼应；在经济上，从“煤钢联营”到“共同市场”，标志着两国垄断集团的进一步结合；在军事上，法国和西德合作制造原子武器，以对抗美英对核武器生产的垄断。
    英国在西欧一向执行着所谓“维持均势”的政策：遏抑西德影响的增长，阻挠法国国际地位的恢复，并防止法国同西德结成联盟。但看来英国的这种政策收效不大。
    法国、西德和英国之间的矛盾，目前集中地表现在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的斗争上。“共同市场”把英国排挤出西欧市场，保证西德称霸西欧。而且从此更会出现一个反对英国的西德—法国轴心。为了抵挡这种局面，英国就纠合非“共同市场”国家提出以“自由贸易区”来代替“共同市场”。这样不仅能保持英国在西欧的地位，而且更利于击败西欧大陆上的竞争者，首先是法国。这一难以调和的矛盾，已使得美国“马歇尔计划”的产物——欧洲经济合作组织濒于崩溃。谁都知道，欧洲经济合作组织标榜着“通过会员国间的经济合作，在欧洲建立自由贸易和自由支付。”现在，十七个成员国已分裂成两个集团，互相排斥，正在走向欧洲经济合作组织所标榜的宗旨的反面。
    由于法国的拒绝，英国“自由贸易区”计划事实上已成泡影。即使“共同市场”六国同西欧其他资本主义国家还会达成某种贸易上的协定，它也不会是英国政府先前所提出的建议。但是，英国显然还没有死心。它一方面摆出姿态，表示不惜同“共同市场”决裂，并指责法国是破坏西欧“经济合作”的罪魁；另方面则对西德竭尽拉拢之能事。前一时期英国首相麦克米伦两次访问波恩，不久前英国又邀请西德总统豪斯访问英国，这是西德最高首脑在战后第一次访问英国。这些访问活动的一个特点，就是竭力标榜所谓“英德亲善”。在豪斯访问英国时，英国外交大臣还故意把戴高乐要求建立“三巨头核心”的密信透露给西德，以示讨好。
    为了软化法国的态度，英国以“维护欧洲团结”为理由，要求美国参与调停。当尼克松访问伦敦时，麦克米伦曾经表示过这种希望。但是尼克松只耸耸肩膀，认为“事关重大”，把这个问题推给了艾森豪威尔。其实，美国官方的态度，已经由“纽约时报”坦率地表明。它说：“对自由贸易区计划谈判的破裂，不管我们多么遗憾，都不应该避而不看共同市场建立的历史重要性。这个组织要求将来有一个新的、持久的政治统一。最后它将证明比现在看来的经济好处更重要。”很明显，美国是想通过由于扶植起来的西德对“共同市场”的领导来进一步在政治上和经济上控制西欧国家。
    以英国为首的十一个国家费尽心计地来研究抵制“共同市场”的对策。英国曾想纠集其余十个西欧国家，组织另一个“关税同盟”，与“共同市场”相抗衡。但是这些国家中除瑞士以外，大多同法国和西德有着传统的经济联系，它们不愿意牺牲自己的利益，充当英国的工具。英国曾宣扬要退出欧洲经济合作组织。看来，这多少有些虚张声势，因为这样做的结果，等于把西欧的经济领导权拱手奉让给西德，有利于西德称霸西欧。英国还宣扬要“采取报复措施”，提高对六国的关税。但是，这对法国和西德并不是个重大的打击，而且这将加深英国同“共同市场”的对立，在客观上起了巩固“共同市场”的作用。
    既然不能从经济上抵制“共同市场”，英国就转而用政治上的办法来进攻“共同市场”国家。当“共同市场”六国和以英国为首的支持“自由贸易区”的十一国谈判破裂后，英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德亲自出场，公然威胁说：如果西方在经济上的“合作”被打破，“军事政治合作”就不能“完整无缺的保存下来”。最近在巴黎会议前夕，英国更利用西柏林问题向西德施加压力，企图逼使西德作出让步，并以此来影响法国。西德由于想在两边捞好处，所以乐得充个“调和者”。
    但是法国的反对的态度还没有改变。甚至在15日的欧洲经济合作局部长理事会上跟英国发生正面的冲突，展开了一场西方通讯社称之为力图“淹死”竞争者的斗争。法国在会议上拒绝了英国要“共同市场”放宽进口限额至全国产量3％的要求，打破了双方达成协议的希望。在后来的北大西洋集团理事会上又由于双方利益的不可调和，而终于无法解决这个矛盾。
    围绕着“共同市场”问题的斗争还未结束，英、法、西德之间还会周旋好几个回合，并将成为一个相当长期的斗争。在这一搏斗中英国所处的形势是十分不利的。
    由此可见，北大西洋公约组织不是“团结”帝国主义集团的因素，而是分裂这个集团的因素。无法调和的矛盾，已使帝国主义阵营四分五裂。在这一形势下，美国在最近举行的巴黎会议上如同它过去所作的一样，擂起反苏反共的大鼓，要求各国“团结”起来，但是杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔所说的“团结”，是要把各国置于美国的控制之下，巩固它在帝国主义集团中的盟主地位。事实上，帝国主义集团内部的矛盾，首先就是美国和西欧各国间的矛盾。如果说最近这一矛盾表现得并不突出，只是因为“共同市场”等尖锐的矛盾正在发展，暂时把前者掩盖起来而已。美国企图加紧控制西欧各国的努力，必然会走向它的愿望的反面。
